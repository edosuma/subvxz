just gonna hang out with Vincent.

06:13.575 --> 06:17.990
Well, um, I was kind of thinking,
you know, maybe we could, um...

06:22.125 --> 06:25.280

07:38.525 --> 07:41.983
I'm telling you, this new guy's
supposed to be a total psycho.

07:42.018 --> 07:44.011
I heard he broke another kid's neck
at his last school.

07:44.046 --> 07:47.070
Then he got kicked off the football
team for pulling a knife on a coach.

07:47.142 --> 07:49.769
And all the coach did was grab
him, and the guy goes nuts!

07:49.839 --> 07:52.561
- And this guy's coming to our school?
- Today.

07:52.634 --> 07:55.195
After he broke that kid's neck,
they tried to throw him in jail.

07:55.263 --> 07:57.655
- The judge let him off.
- This guy ought to be locked up.

07:57.725 --> 07:59.177
Did you hear what he did at Lincoln?

07:59.212 --> 08:01.480
They were supposed to be dissecting
these pregnant sand sharks.

08:01.551 --> 08:04.478
But he refused to do it. He said
sharks were his favorite animal.

08:04.546 --> 08:07.539
- Great. A psychotic shark lover.
- So the teacher grabs him by the arm...

08:07.607 --> 08:08.992
and tries to take him to the office.

08:09.069 --> 08:12.553
- Thing is the teacher didn't know
the guy was a touch freak.
- Touch freak?

08:12.631 --> 08:14.821
Yeah. He doesn't
like to be touched by anybody.

08:15.193 --> 08:17.469
Put the teacher
in the hospital for three days.

08:17.504 --> 08:21.312
<i>- Just because he touched him?
- This guy is definitely on tilt.
- Guys!</i>

08:21.381 --> 08:25.198
That's not even the whole story.
After he duked the science teacher,

08:25.275 --> 08:27.270
they send the dude
into Continuation.

08:27.637 --> 08:31.120
On the first day, he got into a fight
with the three baddest dudes.

08:31.197 --> 08:34.721
Seriously totaled their asses...
at the same time!

08:34.791 --> 08:37.808
- Have you heard about his brass knuckles?
- The dude has brass knuckles?

08:37.986 --> 08:42.341
Yeah. Uses them on special occasions.
He hit that Continuation dude...

08:42.412 --> 08:44.535
- ...so hard his nose flew off his face.
- Seriously?

08:44.607 --> 08:47.395
Totally serious. He's also got this
thing about being touched.

08:47.872 --> 08:50.932
I heard he broke a guy's neck
just because he touched him.

08:51.008 --> 08:53.943
- Because he touched him?
- He didn't like to be touched.

08:54.011 --> 08:55.945
That's completely weird.
Does this guy play football?

08:56.013 --> 08:57.947
- No.
- Good.

08:58.015 --> 09:02.111
- Used to. Remember the guy who
pulled a knife on his coach?
- Yeah.

09:02.186 --> 09:04.416
- That's him.
- Jesus.

09:04.488 --> 09:07.285
He was in Continuation.
He took a swing at one
of his teachers.

09:07.357 --> 09:11.054
These guys aren't your
average history types.
They're like ex-cops.

09:11.127 --> 09:14.893
I heard they carry guns.
He came here
from Continuation?

09:14.964 --> 09:17.728
Uh-huh. That's why they
call it Continuation:

09:17.801 --> 09:21.896
so you can continue murdering
people and still graduate.

09:21.970 --> 09:25.873
<i>What's this guy's name,
anyway?</i>

09:39.488 --> 09:42.286
His name's Buddy Revell.

10:04.345 --> 10:07.280
Good morning, Jerry.
Hi, Mr. Rice.

10:07.348 --> 10:09.407
All right, now.

10:09.483 --> 10:12.451
We got pens,
and we got plastic tabs.

10:12.519 --> 10:17.389
<i>All you have to do is sign
right above my name, right here.</i>

10:17.458 --> 10:20.393
How we doin' this week?
Oh, we're doin'
really great.

10:23.263 --> 10:25.197
Over $470.

10:28.869 --> 10:33.602
That's terrific. We must be doin'
something right, hmm?

10:33.673 --> 10:36.369
Uh, listen, that's a lot of cash.

10:36.443 --> 10:39.276
I suggest you take it over and
deposit it after school today.

10:39.346 --> 10:41.506
All right?
I'll see you later.

10:41.580 --> 10:44.640
I gotta chalk the sidelines for
the J.V. game this afternoon.

10:45.986 --> 10:47.919
That's terrific.

10:49.755 --> 10:52.155
You know, we could have
a great party with all that money.

10:52.224 --> 10:55.189
Mom and Dad aren't gonna be back
from Fort Lauderdale until tomorrow.

10:55.190 --> 10:57.342
It's called grand theft, Brei.

10:57.363 --> 11:02.130
Just kidding. Besides, grand theft is only
if you steal more than $500.

11:03.702 --> 11:05.635
Excuse me.

11:05.703 --> 11:08.831
Hi. Can I...

11:08.907 --> 11:11.740
Help me?

11:11.809 --> 11:13.640
I'd like some notebook paper.

11:13.711 --> 11:16.339
Paper?
Any kind in particular?

11:16.414 --> 11:19.076
<i>I could show you something in
standard, or a nice college rule model.</i>

11:19.150 --> 11:21.675
Legal pads, steno pads,
spiral pad, uh...

11:21.753 --> 11:23.721
Just regular white
will be fine.

11:23.788 --> 11:27.553
White. Right. Good choice.

11:27.624 --> 11:29.752
And a pen?

11:29.827 --> 11:31.760
A pen. You won't believe
what just came in.

11:33.364 --> 11:36.333
It's this new pen
from Wright Brothers.

11:39.971 --> 11:43.838
It has this amazing flow system.
When you're doing homework in bed...

11:43.907 --> 11:46.239
and you're writing upside down
and the ink stops flowing?

11:46.309 --> 11:49.938
<i>This pen...
I don't do homework
in bed.</i>

11:50.012 --> 11:54.005
Oh. Yeah. Mm.
How about a Bic?

11:54.084 --> 11:56.847
That's fine.

12:06.062 --> 12:08.724
I think I gave you a five.

12:08.798 --> 12:12.096
Ohh.

12:30.885 --> 12:33.445
<i>It's okay, really.
I'll pick it up later.</i>

12:33.520 --> 12:35.455
No, no.
I... I have it right here.

12:39.160 --> 12:41.685
It's okay, really.

12:46.101 --> 12:48.831
Looks like it's gonna be
one of those days, Jerry.

12:53.307 --> 12:55.468
I take it you heard.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.772
It's a little general,
Vincent.
Buddy Revell.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.575
The guy's the closest thing
to Charlie Manson
ever seen at Weaver.

13:00.647 --> 13:04.048
<i>This could be a big story
for the Titan. We could be
talking major literary awards.</i>

13:04.118 --> 13:06.051
You want to do an article
about this guy for the paper?

13:06.119 --> 13:09.486
Yeah. Maybe one of those
new student profiles.

13:09.555 --> 13:13.720
Up close, personal.
Get some insights into
who he is as a human being.

13:13.794 --> 13:17.321
You're sick, Vincent.
No, no!
This guy's news.

13:17.398 --> 13:20.161
He's never lost a fight, ever.
He's got a perfect record.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.997
Yeah, but Brei told me he broke
some kid's neck at Jefferson.

13:23.069 --> 13:26.766
<i>Yeah.
Isn't it great?</i>

13:26.839 --> 13:29.244
Before I assign the
articles for next week's

13:29.257 --> 13:31.673
issue, there's something
I want to talk about.

13:31.744 --> 13:35.179
There's a new student on campus
today. Buddy Revell.

13:36.548 --> 13:38.516
<i>We've all heard the stories
about Buddy,</i>

13:38.583 --> 13:41.552
but I think we should make him
feel welcome here at Weaver...

13:41.620 --> 13:43.588
rather than alienating him,

13:43.655 --> 13:46.488
which seems to have been
the policy at his previous schools.

13:46.558 --> 13:51.052
So Vincent and I have decided that
we should do a "welcome aboard" piece,

13:51.129 --> 13:53.153
which has been assigned to...

13:54.699 --> 13:56.495
Jerry Mitchell.

14:03.541 --> 14:05.475
<i>- Now, Susan...
- Mrs. Phillips?</i>

14:05.543 --> 14:07.568
May I go to the restroom, please?

14:53.722 --> 14:56.350
Um, excuse me.

14:58.827 --> 15:01.091
Hi. I... I'm Jerry Mitchell.

15:01.163 --> 15:03.324
I'm with the school paper.

15:03.398 --> 15:05.331
<i>The Titan.</i>

15:07.703 --> 15:10.263
I... I know this is a little
weird, me asking who you are...

15:10.339 --> 15:12.704
standing side-by-side
in front of the urinals.

15:12.773 --> 15:14.707
If you're a fag...

15:14.775 --> 15:18.575
Oh, God. Uh, me?
N-No way.

15:27.989 --> 15:32.926
What I'm trying to find out is,
you are Buddy Revell, right?

15:40.901 --> 15:44.234
You a narc?
No. I'm with
the school paper.

15:44.304 --> 15:47.603
What do you want, man?
I just got to this school.

15:47.674 --> 15:52.805
I don't want anything.
Th-That is, all I want to do
is talk to you. See?

15:52.879 --> 15:57.316
They told me to write this
stupid little piece because
you're the new kid on campus.

15:57.384 --> 16:01.786
You're gonna do a stupid
little piece on me?

16:01.854 --> 16:03.823
<i>Why would I want
to look stupid?
No, no, no.</i>

16:03.890 --> 16:08.758
You're not gonna look stupid.
N-Not at all.

16:08.827 --> 16:10.761
And, incidentally, just so you know,

16:10.829 --> 16:13.024
I don't care if you do
all kinds of dope and shit.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.089
I'm not anybody's narc,
you know?

16:17.302 --> 16:22.366
Not that I think that you do dope
or anything like that. I mean...

16:22.441 --> 16:24.465
Shit. Listen.

16:24.542 --> 16:28.603
Why don't we forget this whole thing
and pretend this never happened, okay?

16:42.793 --> 16:45.228
You're never gonna forget
this happened.

17:00.944 --> 17:04.878
I want you to understand
something, Jerry.

17:07.050 --> 17:10.984
I don't like it
when people know about me.

17:11.053 --> 17:15.046
In fact, I don't like it
when anybody knows about me.

17:15.124 --> 17:18.560
So you can take that newspaper
and wipe off your dick with it.

17:20.730 --> 17:23.994
You made me mad, Jerry.

17:24.066 --> 17:28.765
- Now I'm gonna have to do
something to work it off.
- Work it off?

17:28.838 --> 17:33.774
You and me, we're gonna have
a fight today, after school.

17:33.842 --> 17:35.777
3:00 in the parking lot.

17:35.844 --> 17:38.177
You try and run,
I'm gonna track you down.

17:38.247 --> 17:42.182
You go to a teacher,
it's only gonna get worse.

17:42.250 --> 17:44.218
You sneak home,

17:44.286 --> 17:47.380
I'm gonna be under your bed.

17:47.455 --> 17:50.015
You and me.

17:50.091 --> 17:52.218
3:00.

18:40.506 --> 18:44.033
You okay, Jer?
Uh-huh.

18:47.647 --> 18:51.776
Look, Jerry,
about that article...
I just talked to him.

18:51.850 --> 18:54.115
Who?
Him.

18:54.187 --> 18:58.054
"Him" as in Buddy Revell "him"?
Great. What did he say?

18:58.123 --> 19:01.752
He wants to fight me today
at 3:00 in the parking lot.

19:01.827 --> 19:04.421
You didn't touch him,
did you, Jer?

19:04.496 --> 19:07.021
Oh, this isn't good, Jerry.
This is not good.

19:07.099 --> 19:10.829
Jerry, something
is happening inside you.

19:10.901 --> 19:13.461
Buddy Revell's just
challenged him to a fight.
When?

19:13.537 --> 19:16.234
Today.
3:00, in the parking lot.

19:16.308 --> 19:18.400
I'll get in touch with Ethan.
He'll know what to do.

19:18.476 --> 19:20.637
Ethan?
He's my spirit guide.

19:20.711 --> 19:23.646
He lived long ago.
Now he advises me
from the beyond.

19:23.714 --> 19:28.242
Oh. Good idea.
Well, look. W-We're
not gonna need Ethan...

19:28.319 --> 19:30.514
because there's not
gonna be a fight.

19:30.588 --> 19:34.024
I'm just gonna talk
to Buddy Revell and tell him
that there's no reason to fight.

19:34.091 --> 19:36.924
That's all there is to it.
Nobody has to know.

19:36.994 --> 19:40.485
Jerry Mitchell?
I heard you're gonna fight
Buddy Revell after school today.

19:40.564 --> 19:43.623
No, there's not...
Are you a black belt or
something? You look small.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.363
Well, good luck.
Man,
word travels fast.

20:09.391 --> 20:11.689
Uh, excuse me again.

20:14.730 --> 20:18.188
I don't deal with you
until 3:00.

20:18.267 --> 20:21.668
See, that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

20:21.737 --> 20:23.967
There's really no reason
for you and I to fight,

20:24.039 --> 20:26.734
because I'm not gonna do
that piece anymore.

20:26.808 --> 20:28.936
I know you're not,

20:29.010 --> 20:32.707
'cause I told you
I don't like people...

20:34.081 --> 20:36.015
knowin' about me.

20:43.624 --> 20:45.592
Listen to me,
you little shit.

20:45.660 --> 20:48.219
<i>You and me are gonna fight...</i>

20:48.295 --> 20:50.560
at 3:00,

20:50.631 --> 20:55.192
and there is nothing
you can do about it.

20:55.268 --> 20:57.964
<i>- But...</i>

21:16.856 --> 21:19.223
Jerry Mitchell.

21:19.292 --> 21:21.691
Heard about your
little problem, Mitchell.
What problem?

21:21.761 --> 21:24.160
With Buddy Revell.
As I'm sure you know...

21:24.230 --> 21:26.289
Bruce and I are planning to go
to film school at UCLA.

21:26.365 --> 21:29.926
But we can get a head start if
we did a documentary on your fight.

21:30.002 --> 21:32.664
The events leading up to it.
Your feelings as your friends desert you.

21:32.738 --> 21:38.074
How you handle your defeat.
You want to follow me and film
Buddy Revell kicking my ass?

21:38.143 --> 21:40.429
Exactly, but we're not
talking schlock here. We're

21:40.442 --> 21:42.738
talking classy angles. Private moments.
Feelings.

21:42.814 --> 21:44.839
What do you think?
No.

21:44.916 --> 21:46.713
Did you say "no"?
Yes.

21:46.784 --> 21:49.116
We're talking about
making you a star.

21:49.187 --> 21:51.587
Scott, Bruce, Jerry. Sit.

21:51.656 --> 21:55.183
Mr. Medved, I'm really sorry
about being late.
Sit.

21:58.062 --> 21:59.996
Think about it, Mitchell.

22:29.959 --> 22:32.120
I heard you're
gonna fight Buddy Revell.

22:32.194 --> 22:36.563
- Well, actually...
- Ever been in a fight before?

22:37.801 --> 22:41.236
- No.
- Mmm.

22:41.304 --> 22:44.102
<i>The normal flow of life
sometimes includes violence...</i>

22:44.173 --> 22:48.472
<i>and aggression, even in
the wonderful world of insects.</i>

22:48.544 --> 22:53.140
<i>Meet the small, harmless cricket
as he moves through his habitat.</i>

22:53.215 --> 22:57.014
Now let us meet the cricket's
natural enemy, the crab scorpion.

22:57.085 --> 23:01.146
<i>The non-aggressive cricket
goes about his daily routine...</i>

23:01.222 --> 23:04.385
as the crab scorpion lurches
forward, closing in on his prey.

23:04.459 --> 23:06.393
All you need to do is sign
this release form...

23:06.460 --> 23:10.157
just in case there's any skeletal damage,
pain, personal injury.

23:10.231 --> 23:12.290
<i>- We can get a cable sale.
- Unfortunately,</i>

23:12.367 --> 23:14.927
<i>- sign here.
- Our cricket is unaware...</i>

23:15.003 --> 23:16.993
of the danger
that's lurking behind him.

23:17.071 --> 23:20.666
<i>It is clear that the cricket is
no match for the crab scorpion,</i>

23:20.741 --> 23:24.177
<i>- who is equipped
with razor-sharp pincers.
- Drama.</i>

23:24.244 --> 23:28.078
<i>- Everybody will have a copy.
- Suddenly, the cricket
becomes frozen with fear,</i>

23:28.148 --> 23:31.844
unable to escape as
the crab scorpion moves closer.

23:31.919 --> 23:35.217
<i>Unfortunately, our little cricket...</i>

23:35.288 --> 23:38.052
is unable to avoid the inevitable.

23:46.834 --> 23:50.463
<i>Another perfect example...
I need to use the rest room.</i>

23:50.536 --> 23:54.529
In the wonderful world
of insects.

24:06.119 --> 24:11.055
46, 32, 15.

24:11.123 --> 24:13.591
Uh... 46, 32, 15.
46, 32, 15

24:13.659 --> 24:17.561
Vince, what are you doing?
This is Buddy Revell's locker.
I know.

24:17.629 --> 24:19.620
What's 46, 32, 15?

24:19.698 --> 24:21.632
- His combination.
- Vince, stop.

24:21.700 --> 24:25.328
Calm down.
I got a plan.
I want you to stop!

24:25.403 --> 24:28.134
What kind of a plan?
This plan.

24:28.206 --> 24:30.470
You want me to stab him?
Are you crazy?
Of course not.

24:30.542 --> 24:33.078
I'm gonna plant this
sucker in his locker. Then

24:33.091 --> 24:35.638
I'm gonna leave a note
on O'Rourke's desk.

24:35.713 --> 24:38.511
They find the blade,
Buddy's out of the school before lunch.

24:38.582 --> 24:43.042
How'd you get the combination?
I memorized it while you
were talking in the hall.

24:45.556 --> 24:47.819
I guess he doesn't plan
on doing much homework.

24:53.596 --> 24:57.032
- Vince, close the locker.
- Right.

24:57.100 --> 24:59.626
What the hell
are you doing?
Saving your ass?

24:59.704 --> 25:02.935
Open it. Open the damn locker
and get the knife out. Now!

25:03.006 --> 25:04.974
What's your problem?
This plan is gonna work.

25:05.041 --> 25:07.373
Besides, I already planted
the note in O'Rourke's desk.

25:07.444 --> 25:11.107
Don't you get it? He'll know
that we were involved.
He'll know that I planted it.

25:11.181 --> 25:13.979
Who else wants him kicked out
of school as much as me?
You know what?

25:14.050 --> 25:17.110
I think you're getting
just a little paranoid.

25:17.187 --> 25:19.381
You see that clock?

25:19.455 --> 25:21.651
Mm-hmm.
We have about one minute
to get that knife out of there...

25:21.725 --> 25:25.125
before this hallway's full of people,
including Buddy Revell!

25:25.194 --> 25:27.128
Okay, maybe you're right.

25:27.196 --> 25:29.494
Um, what was
that combination again?

25:29.565 --> 25:31.294
You just said it
six million times.

25:31.366 --> 25:34.267
Um, I remember it.
Uh...

25:35.704 --> 25:37.967
- We've got 30 seconds.
- Forty-six!

25:41.375 --> 25:43.105
- Twenty seconds.
- Thirty-two.

25:44.946 --> 25:48.575
- Ten seconds.
- You wouldn't happen to
remember the last number?

25:48.649 --> 25:51.982
Vince, don't do this to me.
Five seconds!

25:52.053 --> 25:54.851
Twenty-five.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.797
Maybe he won't figure it out.

26:08.870 --> 26:11.361
There's always that chance.

26:11.439 --> 26:15.772
Look, I'm gonna try and get
the note during pep assembly.

26:15.842 --> 26:18.243
I'll see you at lunch.
Okay?

26:43.202 --> 26:46.569
Don't be an asshole.
Just ditch. Go. Leave.

26:46.639 --> 26:49.506
Brei, it's not that simple.
I have a book report
due in the fifth period.

26:49.575 --> 26:52.669
I have a math quiz in the sixth.
If I leave, I flunk both.

26:52.745 --> 26:56.181
Listen, Jerry.
Being flunked beats being dead.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.822
It's been quite a morning, Jerry.

27:05.890 --> 27:09.758
- You can say that again.
- Quite a morning.

27:11.429 --> 27:13.363
I've made contact with Ethan.

27:15.666 --> 27:17.897
Ethan's very concerned about you.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.096
Mm-hmm.

27:20.171 --> 27:23.105
But don't worry.
He says you're a warrior,

27:23.173 --> 27:27.008
and that there is a chance
that you will emerge
from this challenge unscathed.

27:27.078 --> 27:29.443
What sort of a chance
does Ethan figure I have?

27:29.513 --> 27:31.572
- That depends.
- On what?

27:31.648 --> 27:35.243
- On us.
- Franny, I know he's
your guardian angel...

27:35.319 --> 27:38.550
Jerry, this is no joke.

27:40.324 --> 27:42.952
It's time for you and I to bond.

28:10.353 --> 28:12.650
<i>Hey! Sit down!</i>

28:23.531 --> 28:26.466
<i>Kill him! Kill him!</i>

28:30.171 --> 28:32.105
Kill him! Kill him!

29:38.337 --> 29:42.103
<i>Out. Or I come in, Mitchell.</i>

29:50.781 --> 29:54.911
Roll! Roll! How do you feel
about your chances?

29:54.986 --> 29:56.817
<i>Do you have any insurance?</i>

29:56.887 --> 29:59.788
Jerry, do you have any chance
this afternoon?

29:59.857 --> 30:02.052
Is the law on your side?

30:02.125 --> 30:05.583
Damn it, you guys!
This is not a movie. This is my life!

30:05.662 --> 30:08.563
Oh, come on, man.
Pain is temporary. Film is forever.

31:10.792 --> 31:12.726
This guy's crazy.

31:25.372 --> 31:29.503
Where you headin' for,
son?
Uh, nowhere, really.

31:36.983 --> 31:39.746
Looks to me like you were
heading off campus.

31:39.819 --> 31:41.754
You got a pass?

31:41.822 --> 31:47.225
No, sir. I was having a problem with
my car, and I thought I might get help.

31:47.294 --> 31:49.284
Why didn't you go
to the office, boy?

31:49.361 --> 31:52.797
Uh, the office. I don't know why
I didn't think of that.

31:52.865 --> 31:55.266
I'll head over there.
Thanks for the help.

31:58.538 --> 32:02.064
Get in. I'll take you.
That's okay.
I can make it on my own.

32:02.141 --> 32:04.371
I said come with me!

32:07.346 --> 32:10.008
<i>I'm doggin' you,
you little punk!</i>

32:16.655 --> 32:18.588
Frisk, son!

32:24.762 --> 32:29.597
What have we got here?
That's not my knife.
See this note?

32:29.667 --> 32:32.727
Another kid was...
Shh!

32:40.410 --> 32:43.709
You can explain it all
to Mr. Dolinski. Come on.

32:55.025 --> 32:58.188
Caught this one trying to ditch
during the rally.

32:58.262 --> 33:01.459
After routine search
for narcotics, I found this.

33:04.934 --> 33:07.802
Thank you, Duke.
I'll take it from here.

33:07.870 --> 33:09.804
Yes, sir.

33:12.642 --> 33:17.011
You tell all your little friends
there's no escapin' the Duker.

33:18.080 --> 33:20.275
You got that? Hmm?

33:20.349 --> 33:23.147
Y-Yes.

33:23.219 --> 33:25.153
Good.

33:42.603 --> 33:45.936
I don't think I've had you
in my office before.

33:46.006 --> 33:50.067
Jerry Mitchell, sir.

33:50.144 --> 33:52.977
No, I don't think I've been
in your office before.

33:54.216 --> 33:57.583
Eva, I'll need the file
on Jerry Mitchell.

33:57.652 --> 34:00.484
<i>Right away, Mr. D.</i>

34:00.554 --> 34:04.081
I really don't think there's
any reason to put this in my file, sir.

34:07.328 --> 34:09.295
What were you going to do
with the blade, Jerry?

34:09.362 --> 34:12.525
Well, you see,
it's really not my knife.

34:12.600 --> 34:15.694
Buddy Revell wants to fight me
at 3:00 in the parking lot,

34:15.768 --> 34:17.702
and I couldn't get out of it.

34:17.770 --> 34:22.868
So a friend... Well, I had this really
stupid idea that I might be able...

34:22.943 --> 34:26.309
to get Buddy kicked out
before I had to fight him.

34:26.380 --> 34:30.610
So I planted the knife in his locker
and put a note on Mr. O'Rourke's desk.

34:30.683 --> 34:33.982
Only he found out about
the knife before you guys did,

34:34.053 --> 34:39.251
and he stuck it in my mom's
steering wheel with a note
that I could never get away.

34:39.324 --> 34:43.351
<i>But like I said,
it's really not my knife.</i>

34:43.428 --> 34:47.295
That is absolutely
the most ridiculous excuse
I have ever heard...

34:47.366 --> 34:51.199
in my entire career
as a disciplinarian, Jerry.

34:51.270 --> 34:53.898
<i>But it's true.</i>

34:53.972 --> 34:58.840
Hello, Bill. Voytek. Did you receive
a note regarding the contents...

34:58.910 --> 35:00.844
of Buddy Revell's locker?

35:02.280 --> 35:04.215
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

35:04.283 --> 35:06.274
<i>All right. Thanks.</i>

35:09.253 --> 35:13.212
They haven't found a note
anywhere near his office.

35:13.291 --> 35:15.452
<i>But...</i>

35:17.862 --> 35:20.057
Jerry Mitchell's file,
Mr. D.

35:20.130 --> 35:22.759
Thank you, Eva.

35:33.743 --> 35:36.007
This can't be right.

35:36.079 --> 35:39.571
Not one single unexcused absence
in three years?

35:39.649 --> 35:42.675
<i>That's very hard to believe.</i>

35:42.752 --> 35:46.882
I'm telling you the truth, sir.
I wouldn't leave school
without a good reason.

35:48.991 --> 35:52.449
I'm not quite sure
what's going on here, Mitchell.

35:52.528 --> 35:57.932
But I want you to understand something.
I've dealt with students like you before.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.492
You put on a good front
for a couple of years,

36:00.570 --> 36:04.266
and suddenly you think you can
get away with bloody murder.

36:05.774 --> 36:07.708
I'm going to be watching you...

36:07.776 --> 36:09.710
from now on.

36:10.778 --> 36:14.111
And if I hear
even a peep from you,

36:14.182 --> 36:17.618
be assured your college
acceptance boards will hear from me.

36:17.685 --> 36:21.917
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir. Yes.

36:25.226 --> 36:28.491
Here.
Well, open it.

36:29.997 --> 36:32.966
"Dear Mr. O'Rourke.
Earlier today I spotted Buddy Revell...

36:33.034 --> 36:35.559
"placing a large switchblade
in his locker.

36:35.636 --> 36:38.230
"I feel it is my duty
as an honorable student...

36:38.306 --> 36:41.469
"to alert you of this dangerous
and felonious situation.

36:41.542 --> 36:43.736
Sincerely, Jerry Mitchell."

36:43.811 --> 36:46.938
You put my name on the note?
There's no reason to get
pissed. It's over now.

36:47.013 --> 36:51.110
Besides, I got the note
before O'Rourke even saw it.
Oh, Jesus.

36:51.185 --> 36:53.482
Hey. You Jerry Mitchell?

36:53.553 --> 36:57.045
Yeah.
Oh, perfect. You heard that the
guys in the accounting club...

36:57.124 --> 36:59.558
have come up with these pools.

36:59.626 --> 37:03.426
Pools?
Betting pools on your fight
this afternoon.

37:03.497 --> 37:06.227
What?
I was wondering
if you could try...

37:06.299 --> 37:08.562
and make the fight last
longer than three minutes.

37:08.634 --> 37:11.967
You could do a lot of footwork
and shit,

37:12.037 --> 37:13.971
or maybe just run away
or something.

37:14.039 --> 37:17.304
'Cause my bet is that you'll last
three or more minutes with Buddy.

37:17.376 --> 37:20.812
And I got faith in you, man.
I think you're solid.

37:20.880 --> 37:24.748
You guys are making bets
on the fight? Taking odds
on my destruction?

37:24.817 --> 37:29.083
That's obscene.
You're right. I wouldn't
make that bet if I were you.

37:29.155 --> 37:32.215
Hey, Jerry.
Do you cut easy?

37:32.291 --> 37:34.623
'Cause there's good odds
going in the stitches category.

37:34.693 --> 37:38.527
- Stitches category?
- Yeah. It's something the
accounting club came up with.

37:38.597 --> 37:41.725
You bet on how many stitches
it's gonna take to fix Jerry's face.

37:41.801 --> 37:45.861
Whoa! Save it for the fight!
Remember, three minutes. Heavy.

37:49.407 --> 37:52.102
Vince, all hell is breaking
loose over this thing.

37:52.176 --> 37:55.043
I have to convince Buddy Revell
we can't fight today.

37:55.112 --> 37:58.104
That approach
didn't work out
too well last time.

38:00.318 --> 38:02.911
Why didn't I think
of this sooner?
Think of what?

38:02.986 --> 38:05.386
Vince, you got to
help me out with this.
Help you with what?

38:05.456 --> 38:08.323
Find out where Craig Mattey
is next period. Then get me
out of Western Civ.

38:08.392 --> 38:12.488
How am I supposed to do that?
You're the editor.
You'll think of something.

38:12.563 --> 38:15.327
What do you want
with Craig?
Just get me out.

38:15.399 --> 38:18.129
I have to talk to him
before lunch.

38:18.202 --> 38:22.104
Achilles struck Hector
in the throat with his spear.

38:22.172 --> 38:25.801
His body spewed blood
in all directions.

38:25.876 --> 38:30.312
The crowd roared with pleasure.

38:46.127 --> 38:49.494
The moment of truth had come.

38:54.336 --> 38:56.600
Good job, Vince. Did you find out
what class Craig was in?

38:56.671 --> 38:58.969
Ceramics, but he's probably
headed to the track by now.

39:14.889 --> 39:18.154
<i>Move along.
Stay with your classes.</i>

39:18.225 --> 39:21.285
Off the track.
Come on. Come on.

39:37.378 --> 39:39.311
Vince, boost me up.
Come on.

39:43.783 --> 39:46.149
There he is!
Let me down.

39:54.192 --> 39:57.821
Hi, Craig.
Do you remember me?

39:57.896 --> 40:01.525
I'm Jerry Mitchell. I helped you with
math homework in the sixth grade.

40:01.600 --> 40:03.830
Yeah, I guess.

40:03.902 --> 40:08.236
Listen, can I talk to you for
a minute? Alone?

40:08.307 --> 40:10.468
If you're a fag...
No! No.

40:10.542 --> 40:13.237
I just need your advice
on something.

40:14.846 --> 40:19.339
All right.
What do you want?

40:19.417 --> 40:23.114
Well, I have this problem
with Buddy Revell.

40:23.187 --> 40:27.487
What kind of problem?
Actually, he wants to
beat me up after school.

40:27.558 --> 40:30.288
That's a big problem.
I know. I'm...

40:30.361 --> 40:33.262
Well, I also remember
that a couple of years ago...

40:33.331 --> 40:35.265
you stuck up for Jimmy Hawkins.

40:35.333 --> 40:37.699
You beat Jeff Stevens' ass that day,
and I was wondering maybe...

40:37.768 --> 40:40.259
you might be able to
help me out this afternoon.

40:40.338 --> 40:42.602
Jimmy Hawkins had asthma.

40:42.673 --> 40:44.833
Well, I have hypoglycemia.

40:44.908 --> 40:47.706
He also paid me a hundred bucks
to take on Stevens.

40:47.777 --> 40:50.542
A hundred bucks!

40:50.615 --> 40:54.573
Well, how much would you
charge me for Buddy Revell?

40:54.651 --> 40:57.643
Four-fifty.
$450!

40:57.721 --> 41:01.487
That's a 350% markup.
Inflation, man.

41:01.558 --> 41:03.718
I'm just trying to do you
a favor.

41:03.792 --> 41:05.727
Wait, wait,
wait a minute.

41:07.630 --> 41:10.326
If I can get the money,

41:10.399 --> 41:12.459
do you think you'd do it
for me?

41:12.535 --> 41:15.868
Revell will never
bother you again.

41:15.938 --> 41:19.430
Guaranteed.
Great. Oh, great.

41:19.508 --> 41:22.636
Listen, you'll have the money before
the end of the fire drill.

41:47.969 --> 41:49.960
Okay.

43:31.001 --> 43:33.299
All right, people,

43:33.370 --> 43:36.066
you may return
to your classes.

43:36.140 --> 43:38.972
This has been a false alarm.

43:39.041 --> 43:41.566
Let me assure you,

43:41.644 --> 43:43.875
whoever is responsible,

43:44.947 --> 43:47.211
I'm going to find you.

43:48.551 --> 43:51.042
Hey, Craig?
You got the cash?

43:51.120 --> 43:53.145
Could we talk about this alone?

43:56.525 --> 43:58.926
It's all here, $450.

43:58.995 --> 44:01.259
But you can't tell anybody
that I paid you to do this.

44:01.330 --> 44:03.695
You think I want Dolinski
on my ass?

44:03.765 --> 44:06.256
Don't worry about it.
This is business.

44:06.334 --> 44:09.861
No one needs to know.
Okay, great.

44:09.938 --> 44:14.272
When are you gonna do it?
Lunch is always
the best time.

44:14.342 --> 44:18.210
A lot of confusion.
Takes the teachers a while to
figure what the hell's going on.

44:21.550 --> 44:23.609
Don't worry about it.

44:23.685 --> 44:25.618
Should be no problem.

44:40.034 --> 44:42.901
<i>Even as Hector begged for mercy,</i>

44:42.970 --> 44:45.234
Achilles lashed him to his chariot...

44:45.306 --> 44:47.899
and dragged Hector
around the city,

44:47.974 --> 44:52.912
finally leaving his body
to be mutilated by wild dogs.

44:56.250 --> 44:59.582
Hector's destiny
had finally come to...

44:59.652 --> 45:01.950
Excuse me, Lorraine.

45:02.021 --> 45:04.455
I must speak to Jerry Mitchell
immediately.

45:11.698 --> 45:16.066
What has happened here is so heinous,
I almost can't bear to show it to you.

45:17.170 --> 45:19.103
I can take it.

45:24.877 --> 45:26.811
Oh, God.

45:28.180 --> 45:31.046
It isn't just vandalism, Jerry.

45:31.115 --> 45:34.346
We're talking
about grand theft. Look.

45:34.418 --> 45:36.353
Look at this.

45:37.355 --> 45:39.654
Our weekly earnings are gone.

45:39.725 --> 45:43.388
But I thought grand theft
was if you stole $500 or more.

45:43.462 --> 45:45.861
This is so stupid.

45:48.666 --> 45:51.396
Why would anybody...

45:51.469 --> 45:54.131
do something like this?

45:58.776 --> 46:01.336
Goddamn it!

46:04.882 --> 46:07.817
Maybe it was some sort
of freak accident.

46:07.885 --> 46:10.250
Accident?

46:10.320 --> 46:12.652
You gotta be kidding me.
Look at the place.

46:12.722 --> 46:14.747
Look at it!

46:14.824 --> 46:17.224
It's no accident.

46:17.294 --> 46:19.922
As far as I am concerned,
whoever did this is a criminal.

46:19.996 --> 46:22.988
Whoever did this should be
plucked out of our school...

46:23.066 --> 46:26.433
like a burgeoning cancerous
growth deep inside the colon.

46:26.503 --> 46:30.030
I couldn't agree
with you more, sir.

46:30.106 --> 46:32.539
G-Go on.

46:41.417 --> 46:44.648
Geez, man. I lost you on the field.
What happened with Craig?

46:44.720 --> 46:48.656
He said he'd do it.
Did I tell you
you were gonna live?

46:48.724 --> 46:50.657
When's he gonna do it?
Lunch.

46:50.725 --> 46:54.718
That's unbelievable! We gotta see this.
I gotta see this. Come on!

47:31.965 --> 47:34.091
How you doin', Buddy?

47:34.166 --> 47:38.570
- Do I know you?
- Played football against each other.

47:42.476 --> 47:44.909
Oh, right.

47:49.749 --> 47:52.980
You were the puss
who always bled.

47:53.052 --> 47:56.647
I hear you're givin'
Jerry Mitchell a hard time.

47:56.722 --> 47:58.656
Yeah.

47:58.724 --> 48:01.090
It's gonna get even harder.

48:01.160 --> 48:03.354
You...

48:03.428 --> 48:06.522
aren't gonna do shit to him.

48:06.598 --> 48:09.761
Asshole.

48:31.388 --> 48:33.323
Shh.

49:50.164 --> 49:52.894
Your face looks
like nonfat milk.

49:52.967 --> 49:55.401
Thanks.

49:55.469 --> 49:57.960
Did Mr. Hypoglycemia
eat any lunch?

49:58.038 --> 50:00.472
No.

50:00.541 --> 50:03.032
Looks like you can
forget about breakfast too.

50:05.845 --> 50:08.905
So Buddy Revell kicked
Craig Msattey's ass?

50:08.982 --> 50:11.450
He broke his face...
literally.

50:11.518 --> 50:15.147
At least we got your money back.
Where'd you get $450?

50:15.221 --> 50:19.214
<i>You got the money back?
Yeah.</i>

50:19.292 --> 50:21.590
Craig felt bad knowin' you were
gonna get it even worse.

50:23.663 --> 50:26.598
<i>Anyway, he said he was
gonna give me all of it,</i>

50:26.666 --> 50:28.827
but I told him he deserved
a hundred for his trouble.

50:28.902 --> 50:32.531
You gave him $100?
You didn't get all of it back?

50:32.605 --> 50:35.038
<i>Well, no.
Not all of it.</i>

50:36.642 --> 50:39.941
The guy got two teeth punched out,
not to mention a broken finger!

50:40.012 --> 50:42.105
Shit, Vincent,
I need that money!

50:42.181 --> 50:45.911
Don't get pissed at me.
It's not my fault you hired
Craig to beat up Buddy Revell.

50:45.983 --> 50:48.953
Not your fault?
This whole thing is your fault.

50:49.021 --> 50:52.786
<i>If you wouldn't have
given me that assignment,
I wouldn't be puking...</i>

50:52.857 --> 50:55.485
while I wait to have my face
rearranged by a psychopath!

50:55.560 --> 50:57.756
You didn't have to touch Revell
in the bathroom, did you?

50:57.829 --> 51:01.924
<i>- Did I tell you to do that?
- Get outta here.
Just get outta here!</i>

51:01.999 --> 51:06.368
You always have an excuse.
Just admit that you set me up. Admit it!

51:06.437 --> 51:09.463
Look, I...

51:10.708 --> 51:13.700
Screw you, man!

51:14.778 --> 51:18.509
Here.
Take your suckin' blood money.

51:31.728 --> 51:34.720
So you stole the 450 bucks
from the student store, huh?

51:36.967 --> 51:40.026
I still don't understand
why you didn't just leave.

51:40.102 --> 51:43.196
<i>I already tried.
Dolinski nailed me.</i>

51:43.272 --> 51:45.900
Besides, I can't leave today.

51:45.975 --> 51:48.967
I'm under suspicion for possessing
a concealed weapon.

51:49.044 --> 51:52.036
<i>What?
Oh, never mind.</i>

51:52.114 --> 51:55.208
I'm tellin' you,
there's no way out.

51:55.284 --> 51:59.983
<i>Remember how last summer
we used to watch Gunsmoke
reruns three times a day?</i>

52:00.055 --> 52:03.422
Brei, what does that have
to do with anything?

52:03.492 --> 52:06.757
Whenever a guy wanted to get out of
a showdown, what did he do?

52:08.396 --> 52:11.388
I don't know. He got himself
thrown into jail, I guess.

52:11.466 --> 52:14.094
Exactly. What class
do you have next period?

52:14.168 --> 52:16.729
English. I have to do
a book report.

52:16.805 --> 52:19.102
That's perfect.

52:19.173 --> 52:22.734
Do whatever you have to do,
but don't leave that class
without getting detention.

52:22.810 --> 52:24.744
You get detention after school,

52:24.812 --> 52:26.870
nobody'll expect you
to show up for the fight...

52:26.947 --> 52:29.542
and not even Buddy'll be able
to touch you.

52:44.898 --> 52:46.832
<i>All right.</i>

52:46.900 --> 52:49.425
We're going to try and get through
as many book reports as we can today.

52:49.503 --> 52:51.528
Are there any volunteers?

52:51.605 --> 52:53.539
Yo.

52:53.607 --> 52:57.099
Jerry.
All right. Go ahead.

53:14.092 --> 53:16.721
Let me ask you a question.

53:18.164 --> 53:20.256
<i>Why am I standing here?</i>

53:20.332 --> 53:25.566
<i>I mean, the whole point
of books is that you read them.</i>

53:25.638 --> 53:29.574
Uh, the minute you start telling people
about them. That means
they didn't read them.

53:29.641 --> 53:35.341
<i>Which means that book reports
contribute to illiteracy,
which is a real social problem.</i>

53:35.413 --> 53:37.904
Jerry, did you
actually read a book?

53:37.982 --> 53:39.916
<i>Would you gimme a break?
Well, could we...</i>

53:39.984 --> 53:43.009
- I'm tryin' to make
a point here.
- Jerry...

53:43.087 --> 53:45.249
You don't think I could
tell you about a book I read?

53:45.323 --> 53:50.259
Is that what you think?

53:52.930 --> 53:55.364
<i>Jerry. The book.</i>

53:55.432 --> 53:57.798
Fine. The book.

54:03.307 --> 54:05.605
<i>Honey Goes to Hollywood.</i>

54:32.101 --> 54:35.264
It's a good read.

54:35.338 --> 54:37.806
Fast,

54:37.874 --> 54:40.865
angry, sexual.

54:40.942 --> 54:44.605
<i>I was, uh...</i>

54:44.679 --> 54:49.343
<i>I was thinkin' about the syntax
and how it affected the overall mood.</i>

54:50.986 --> 54:56.720
Particularly during the more...
expository passages.

54:56.792 --> 54:59.522
The fifth chapter...

54:59.594 --> 55:03.758
where Honey meets the whole
Australian soccer team.

55:06.200 --> 55:08.691
<i>In fact, I gotta tell ya,</i>

55:08.769 --> 55:12.034
it kinda made me
think of you, Miss Farmer.

55:15.910 --> 55:21.109
<i>There I was, in bed,
reading my book,</i>

55:21.182 --> 55:25.949
Honey's adventures gripping
my imagination.

55:26.020 --> 55:30.388
<i>I just knew I had to tell you about
a book that was this good.</i>

55:32.193 --> 55:34.126
Hey, Mama.

55:35.628 --> 55:39.860
Jerry, I hope
this is going somewhere.
It's going somewhere.

55:47.907 --> 55:51.240
What's your favorite book,
Miss Farmer?

55:51.311 --> 55:55.337
What's
the difference?
It's important to me.

56:00.853 --> 56:04.949
<i>The Turn of the Screw.
What a coincidence.</i>

56:19.837 --> 56:22.829
Now, that's what I call
a book report.

56:54.037 --> 56:56.528
Are we feeling more
like ourselves, Mr. Mitchell?

56:57.873 --> 57:00.865
<i>I understand you managed
to avoid lunch today.</i>

57:00.943 --> 57:05.243
Not very smart for somebody
who's hypoglycemic.

57:05.314 --> 57:08.044
- Cobbler?
- No, thank you.

57:08.117 --> 57:11.883
<i>Did Miss Farmer tell you where I'm
supposed to report for detention?</i>

57:11.954 --> 57:15.617
Detention? She didn't mention
anything about detention.

57:15.691 --> 57:18.495
<i>But she did want me to
tell you your book report</i>

57:18.508 --> 57:21.323
<i>was the best she had
in any of her classes.</i>

57:21.397 --> 57:25.958
- What?
- She said if you don't make it
back to class today...

57:26.034 --> 57:29.697
she would like you to call her
at home this evening: here's her number.

57:34.108 --> 57:36.508
You mean I'm not gonna
have detention after school?

57:36.578 --> 57:41.242
Why, no. You can go back to class
as soon as you feel well enough.

58:00.067 --> 58:03.434
Jerry. Hi.
How you feeling?

58:05.005 --> 58:07.906
I heard about what happened
in Miss Farmer's class.

58:07.975 --> 58:09.840
<i>Already?
Listen,</i>

58:09.909 --> 58:12.572
I'm having a party tomorrow
night and I was wondering
if you'd like to come.

58:12.646 --> 58:16.240
I'll try to make it.
I really will.

58:16.315 --> 58:19.773
Great.
See you tomorrow night.

58:43.341 --> 58:45.775
Hello, Jerry.

58:51.049 --> 58:54.279
<i>Franny,
what are you doing here?</i>

58:54.352 --> 58:59.449
Don't you see?
This is the perfect place.

59:00.524 --> 59:02.652
The... perfect place?

59:04.995 --> 59:06.986
<i>For us to bond.</i>

59:07.064 --> 59:11.057
Oh, Franny, this...
this isn't such a good idea.

59:11.135 --> 59:15.936
Why not?
Today's been the worst day
of my entire life,

59:16.006 --> 59:21.467
and I don't think that...
bonding on a display table
is gonna help much.

59:22.812 --> 59:24.804
<i>It will help, Jerry.</i>

01:00:17.331 --> 01:00:19.959
Um...

01:00:21.536 --> 01:00:24.733
M-Maybe I can think
of something else.

01:00:24.806 --> 01:00:27.330
Um...

01:00:29.677 --> 01:00:32.475
See you later?

01:01:02.609 --> 01:01:05.339
Mr. Rice.
What are you doing here?

01:01:05.411 --> 01:01:09.279
<i>I think I should be asking you
that question, Jerry.</i>

01:01:11.350 --> 01:01:14.080
I was just...

01:01:14.153 --> 01:01:16.849
I was just feeling a little low about
all that's happened in here,

01:01:16.922 --> 01:01:20.551
<i>and I thought I might come by
and clean up a little bit.</i>

01:01:20.626 --> 01:01:25.392
- Who is this kid?
- Jerry Mitchell.
I'm the student manager.

01:01:25.463 --> 01:01:29.593
Mm-hmm.
Jerry, this is
Lieutenant Mulvahill,

01:01:29.667 --> 01:01:32.192
Juvenile Division,
Sheriff's department.

01:01:39.811 --> 01:01:43.042
Better get
back to class, huh?
Yeah.

01:01:46.584 --> 01:01:48.575
I just want you to know...

01:01:48.653 --> 01:01:52.851
I have a strong suspicion
this was an inside job.

01:01:52.924 --> 01:01:55.449
Almost always is.

01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:00.755
Can I go now?
Yeah.
You can go.

01:02:23.018 --> 01:02:25.418
<i>Like a lonely gunfighter
he stands alone,</i>

01:02:25.487 --> 01:02:28.854
<i>his face etched with tension,
his eyes filled with fear...</i>

01:02:28.924 --> 01:02:31.620
as he waits for the inevitable bell
of death to ring.

01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:55.777
<i>All right, take a seat
over there by Jerry Mitchell.</i>

01:03:25.545 --> 01:03:27.479
<i>All right, people.</i>

01:03:27.547 --> 01:03:31.141
As you know, we're having
a review quiz today.

01:03:32.719 --> 01:03:35.186
Buddy, this shouldn't be
too difficult for you.

01:03:35.254 --> 01:03:37.814
It's a review of
the last two chapters.

01:03:37.890 --> 01:03:40.916
See where you left off
in your old school.

01:04:38.015 --> 01:04:42.076
You know how I feel about
cheating, Jerry. I despise it.

01:04:42.152 --> 01:04:45.781
<i>Let's go.
Both of you! Now!</i>

01:04:51.427 --> 01:04:56.490
All right. Which one of you...
gentlemen want to explain this?

01:05:11.514 --> 01:05:13.447
Jerry?

01:05:21.490 --> 01:05:26.621
I hate to admit it, sir,
but I was completely lost
in the quiz. You see...

01:05:27.695 --> 01:05:29.755
I was cheating off of Buddy.

01:05:29.831 --> 01:05:33.028
Do you expect me
to believe that?

01:05:33.101 --> 01:05:34.761
Yes, sir.

01:05:52.786 --> 01:05:55.881
You two boys must think
I'm very stupid.

01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.694
But I believe you.

01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:18.900
It's simple, Buddy.

01:06:18.977 --> 01:06:22.880
<i>All I want you to do is to complete
two problems from this quiz.</i>

01:06:22.949 --> 01:06:28.477
You get them right, I'll know you boys
are telling the truth.

01:06:31.657 --> 01:06:33.592
<i>Get them both wrong...</i>

01:06:35.661 --> 01:06:38.494
we've got a problem.

01:06:38.564 --> 01:06:40.497
Let's go, Buddy.

01:07:39.855 --> 01:07:41.789
They're both right.

01:07:41.857 --> 01:07:44.655
You knew the answers
all along.

01:07:48.030 --> 01:07:49.895
Can I go now?

01:08:11.586 --> 01:08:13.918
I'm disappointed in you, Jerry.

01:08:16.890 --> 01:08:19.792
It's clear to me Buddy came to
this school trying to make an effort.

01:08:19.861 --> 01:08:23.261
And here, on his first day,

01:08:23.331 --> 01:08:26.027
you've taken advantage of him.

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:28.624
I'm sorry, sir.

01:08:28.702 --> 01:08:31.671
I also want you to know...

01:08:31.738 --> 01:08:35.640
that I'm aware of both the incident
in the student store...

01:08:35.709 --> 01:08:38.644
and your felonious possession
of a concealed weapon.

01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:42.908
<i>This could mark the beginning
of a very dangerous trend
in your scholastic career,</i>

01:08:42.982 --> 01:08:45.884
a trend that could have
a severe effect on your future.

01:08:45.952 --> 01:08:48.888
<i>I'm going to be
watching you, Jerry.</i>

01:08:48.956 --> 01:08:51.015
This isn't over yet.

01:08:51.091 --> 01:08:54.354
No, sir. I know it isn't.

01:09:03.803 --> 01:09:07.466
Hey, Buddy? Can I talk to you
for a minute?

01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:11.475
You really blew O'Rourke away
in there, you know?

01:09:11.542 --> 01:09:14.069
I know you really didn't need
my test answers or anything,

01:09:14.145 --> 01:09:17.444
but I kinda got the feeling like,
I don't know,

01:09:17.515 --> 01:09:20.109
like we were a team in there.

01:09:20.185 --> 01:09:24.281
I mean, maybe we could just
forget this whole fight thing
and be friends or something.

01:09:24.356 --> 01:09:28.053
What do you think?
You're never gonna learn,
are you?

01:09:28.126 --> 01:09:32.654
What do you mean?
I mean, no matter
what you say or what you do,

01:09:32.731 --> 01:09:36.723
you and me are gonna fight
when that bell rings at 3:00.

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.928
<i>Can't we be friends?
Can't we even try?</i>

01:09:40.004 --> 01:09:42.939
I don't need friends.

01:09:44.541 --> 01:09:48.910
Hey, wait a minute.
I can't fight you.

01:09:48.979 --> 01:09:51.675
<i>I don't know how to fight
somebody like you.</i>

01:09:51.749 --> 01:09:54.582
<i>Hey, do ya hear me?
I can't do it!</i>

01:09:57.354 --> 01:10:00.551
What if I paid you?
Would you back off then?

01:10:00.624 --> 01:10:03.525
<i>Look, I have $350.</i>

01:10:04.827 --> 01:10:07.388
It's yours if you leave me alone.

01:10:09.399 --> 01:10:13.267
- O'Rourke put you up to this?
- O'Rourke has nothing to do with this.

01:10:13.336 --> 01:10:16.430
Just to call off the fight?
No catches?

01:10:16.506 --> 01:10:19.031
No catches.

01:10:26.282 --> 01:10:29.410
All right. You live.

01:10:29.485 --> 01:10:32.420
Swear to God?
You're not gonna trash me?

01:10:34.089 --> 01:10:36.353
But you know what, Mitchell?

01:10:36.425 --> 01:10:41.055
You're the biggest pussy
I've ever met in my life.

01:10:41.129 --> 01:10:43.063
You didn't even try.

01:10:44.132 --> 01:10:46.065
How's that feel?

01:12:09.747 --> 01:12:13.239
I want my money
back.
No refunds.

01:12:13.317 --> 01:12:17.219
I'm not kiddin', man.
I want it back now!
Or what?

01:12:17.288 --> 01:12:20.018
I'm no pussy, asshole.

01:12:21.626 --> 01:12:25.027
The fight is on. You and me
in the parking lot, 3:00.

01:12:53.757 --> 01:12:56.691
Jerry,
get back in your seat.

01:12:59.495 --> 01:13:01.690
Flunk me.

01:15:04.815 --> 01:15:06.976
All right.
Hold it right there, gentlemen.

01:15:12.890 --> 01:15:16.518
<i>There isn't going to be
any fight today!</i>

01:15:17.660 --> 01:15:20.424
Break it up, people.
Go on home. Go on!

01:15:25.803 --> 01:15:28.464
I said "move," gentlemen.

01:15:30.373 --> 01:15:34.571
Jerry, I'm taking you home.
Buddy, go to my office
and wait for me there.

01:15:34.644 --> 01:15:38.670
Sorry, Mr. O'Rourke.
I just can't do that.

01:15:39.749 --> 01:15:42.774
Really?

01:15:42.851 --> 01:15:45.786
Why don't I give you
a little help?

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:05.866
There. Now it's your turn.

01:16:24.825 --> 01:16:27.020
<i>You leave him alone,
you maniac!</i>

01:16:27.094 --> 01:16:29.994
You want him, you go through me,
you goddamn animal!

01:16:30.063 --> 01:16:33.226
You hear me? You just go ahead
and go through me!

01:16:33.299 --> 01:16:35.164
Move!

01:16:38.772 --> 01:16:43.800
Come on, you asshole!
Come on, you peckerhead,
let's see what you got!

01:17:14.673 --> 01:17:18.507
<i>Move, move, move!
Move, move, move, move!</i>

01:17:35.058 --> 01:17:36.993
You're not done
over here, pussy!

01:17:38.729 --> 01:17:40.664
Let's finish.

01:17:54.244 --> 01:17:57.736
<i>Let's go!
Come on. Let him have it!</i>

01:18:01.118 --> 01:18:05.179
Jerry! Stick him, Jerry!
You can do it!

01:18:05.255 --> 01:18:09.714
Shit! Three minutes!
Go, Jerry! Three minutes!

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:17.657
<i>Come on. Let him have it!</i>

01:19:33.306 --> 01:19:37.003
Jerry, Jerry,
are you all right?

01:19:42.215 --> 01:19:44.148
Cripple the dick!

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:34.023
Kill him, Jer!

01:20:34.098 --> 01:20:36.658
- Break his face!
- Rip his head off!

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:40.002
Don't fuck this up,
Mitchell!

01:20:42.639 --> 01:20:46.838
No one's gonna help you now.
It's just you and me!

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:48.267
Oooh!

01:22:07.487 --> 01:22:10.820
You may have saved yourself
for the time being, Mr. Mitchell,

01:22:10.890 --> 01:22:15.292
but we still have a matter
of $450 to discuss.

01:22:16.495 --> 01:22:19.623
Get the Revell boy.
I want to talk to him too.

01:22:27.639 --> 01:22:31.939
- He's gone, sir.
- Fine. We'll find him.

01:22:32.011 --> 01:22:36.641
- Okay, Jerry. Let's go.
- Let the boy go, detective.

01:22:38.984 --> 01:22:40.917
He's had enough for today.

01:22:45.390 --> 01:22:48.291
You can discuss this
with him tomorrow.

01:22:50.094 --> 01:22:52.619
Fine.

01:22:52.697 --> 01:22:55.598
I will see you in the student store
tomorrow morning.

01:23:04.409 --> 01:23:06.342
<i>It's a rip-off if you ask me.</i>

01:23:06.943 --> 01:23:10.379
You kick Buddy Revell's ass,
and he gets away with 350 bucks.

01:23:10.447 --> 01:23:12.881
Screw it. At this point
I don't really care.

01:23:12.949 --> 01:23:16.009
That's a lie
and you know it.

01:23:16.086 --> 01:23:19.715
<i>Excuse me.
You have any paper?</i>

01:23:19.790 --> 01:23:21.882
Yeah. Sure.

01:23:25.528 --> 01:23:27.463
Oh, I just need one sheet.

01:23:27.531 --> 01:23:31.489
How much would that be?
A dollar a sheet? Great.

01:23:33.737 --> 01:23:36.671
I'll take five.

01:23:39.475 --> 01:23:41.568
<i>Jerry.</i>

01:23:41.644 --> 01:23:45.740
<i>Vincent Costello told us
the student store was having
a little cash flow problem.</i>

01:23:45.815 --> 01:23:47.749
I'll take two sheets.

01:23:52.788 --> 01:23:55.586
Oh, and Jerry?
You did a great thing yesterday.

01:23:55.658 --> 01:23:58.421
<i>Yeah, unbelievable.
I'll take three.</i>

01:24:00.295 --> 01:24:03.526
Four sheets.
I'll take
a sheet.

01:24:04.799 --> 01:24:07.267
<i>Hey, Jerry! I scored.</i>

01:24:07.335 --> 01:24:11.328
You lasted four minutes.
I knew you were solid.

01:24:11.406 --> 01:24:13.601
I'll take 30.

01:24:16.744 --> 01:24:19.211
Gimme one.

01:24:20.181 --> 01:24:23.115
Give me three.
Thank you.

01:24:24.818 --> 01:24:26.877
I'll take two sheets.

01:24:26.954 --> 01:24:29.115
<i>I'll take five.</i>

01:24:29.189 --> 01:24:33.921
- This is incredible!
- There must be a hundred bucks!

01:25:56.673 --> 01:25:58.608
Hi, Jerry.

01:25:58.676 --> 01:26:00.540
Oh, uh, hi, Karen.

01:26:00.610 --> 01:26:03.010
I guess I'll see you
at my house tonight.

01:26:03.079 --> 01:26:06.276
Oh, yeah. Uh...

01:26:17.193 --> 01:26:19.126
Hello, Jerry.

01:26:39.914 --> 01:26:42.247
Unbelievable!

01:26:55.462 --> 01:26:58.920
Hmm. Looks like it's gonna be
one of those days.

01:27:02.837 --> 01:27:06.033
That was the best fight since Craig Mattey
kicked Jeff Stevens' ass.

01:27:06.106 --> 01:27:08.734
I still can't believe he dropped
Revell with just one punch.

01:27:08.808 --> 01:27:10.743
Someone told me
he's a black belt.

01:27:10.811 --> 01:27:12.971
Did you guys hear? He's goin' out with
Karen Clarke now.

01:27:13.046 --> 01:27:15.810
The guy's a stud. Did you hear
what happened in his English class?

01:27:15.882 --> 01:27:17.941
Isn't that where
he attacked Miss Farmer?
Yeah!

01:27:18.018 --> 01:27:21.010
Jerry ripped her clothes off
in front of the whole class!

01:27:21.087 --> 01:27:23.021
I heard she decked him
on the spot.

01:27:23.089 --> 01:27:25.114
The guy's
a completely righteous dude.

01:27:25.191 --> 01:27:28.023
Did you hear that Mr. O'Rourke
tried to keep Jerry from fighting Buddy?

01:27:28.093 --> 01:27:30.789
<i>Mitchell wouldn't do it.
Jerry wanted to fight Buddy?</i>

01:27:30.863 --> 01:27:35.197
Yeah. Buddy was pickin' on him.
Jerry told him to meet him
in the parking lot at 3:00.

01:27:35.267 --> 01:27:38.794
This guy's a madman!
That's nothin'. Did you hear
about the switchblade?

01:27:38.871 --> 01:27:40.998
Buddy was going to try and knife
Jerry before the fight,

01:27:41.073 --> 01:27:43.837
but Jerry picked his locker
and got to the knife before him.

01:27:43.909 --> 01:27:47.208
It's unbelievable.
Why haven't I heard of
this Mitchell guy before?

01:27:47.279 --> 01:27:50.476
Who knows?
I guess he's not the kind
of guy to brag about himself.

01:27:50.549 --> 01:27:53.609
I think he's kinda cute.
Did you hear what he did
to Miss Farmer?

01:27:53.686 --> 01:27:56.518
I'm telling you, this guy's
supposed to be a total psycho.
