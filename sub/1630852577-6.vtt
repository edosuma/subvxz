00:06.103 --> 00:07.896
Previously
onRuPaul's Drag Race....

00:07.965 --> 00:10.724
You need to create
a public service announcement

00:10.793 --> 00:13.551
for the Save a Queen
organization.

00:13.620 --> 00:15.241
Hit it!

00:15.310 --> 00:18.206
-Reach into your pocket...
-And give her some fucking cash.

00:18.275 --> 00:20.931
She's back to tip spots
at her local bar.

00:21.000 --> 00:24.931
Filming in her bathroom
was cute for a bit.

00:26.034 --> 00:27.413
Start packing now.

00:28.517 --> 00:29.862
Jorgeous.

00:29.931 --> 00:31.034
That confidence
you have on the runway

00:31.103 --> 00:33.482
-was not on the screen.
-Orion Story.

00:33.551 --> 00:35.896
It could have been more emotion.

00:35.965 --> 00:37.241
Bosco.

00:37.310 --> 00:38.482
I appreciated it,

00:38.551 --> 00:40.241
because it was different
to everybody else.

00:40.310 --> 00:42.137
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

00:44.310 --> 00:47.896
Jorgeous, shantay you stay.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.172
Orion, sashay away.

00:59.758 --> 01:01.172
Oh, girl.

01:01.241 --> 01:02.931
Oh, my God, girl.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.931
-Whew.
-That was a lip sync, bitch.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.620
Orion has left the building.

01:08.689 --> 01:10.068
It's no surprise to me,

01:10.137 --> 01:13.517
because, baby, Jorgeous
slayed that lip sync.

01:13.586 --> 01:16.103
I knew she was a dancer,
but, damn.

01:16.172 --> 01:17.517
Come on for the novel.

01:17.586 --> 01:19.862
Oh, she gave you
an Orion story.

01:19.931 --> 01:23.172
It says, "Bitch,
y'all put up a..."

01:23.241 --> 01:25.551
Sorry. I dropped out
of high school.

01:27.068 --> 01:29.724
Oh, girl, like,
being in the bottom two

01:29.793 --> 01:32.620
is not the fucking tea at all.

01:32.689 --> 01:35.862
Like, I'm so pissed at myself,
because I knew I could do it.

01:35.931 --> 01:36.862
I just need to, like...

01:36.931 --> 01:39.379
Use that as fuel, baby.

01:39.448 --> 01:40.896
Use that as fuel.

01:40.965 --> 01:42.448
Going into this challenge,

01:42.517 --> 01:44.344
it's, like, I'm not funny,
I'm not this, I'm not that.

01:44.413 --> 01:47.275
So at this point, I really need,
like, to stop doubting myself,

01:47.344 --> 01:50.689
because Miss RuPaul says
I was born to do drag, you know?

01:50.758 --> 01:53.620
It really puts a fire
under my ass,

01:53.689 --> 01:56.862
because that's the closest
I wanna be in the bottom,

01:56.931 --> 01:59.413
and I don't wanna lip sync
again, I really don't.

01:59.482 --> 02:01.724
Uh, Miss Bosco.

02:01.793 --> 02:02.862
Miss Bosco!

02:05.689 --> 02:06.724
How you feeling?

02:06.793 --> 02:07.793
I'm walking on sunshine,

02:07.862 --> 02:09.172
I'm feeling it.

02:09.241 --> 02:11.241
I got the momentum
that I needed.

02:11.310 --> 02:14.413
Getting the win on the board
is like that first domino,

02:14.482 --> 02:16.896
and now you can really
get the ball rolling.

02:16.965 --> 02:18.172
How does it feel?

02:18.241 --> 02:20.862
Camden, you, top three.

02:20.931 --> 02:22.827
For them to look at us
and say those amazing things,

02:22.896 --> 02:25.655
it was like, am I--
am I dreaming?

02:25.724 --> 02:27.655
Daya, you were
a little bit disappointed

02:27.724 --> 02:29.448
with being safe in Untucked.

02:29.517 --> 02:30.931
Oh, I wasn't disappointed.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.655
Don't twist my words, bitch.

02:33.655 --> 02:35.034
Ooh!

02:35.103 --> 02:38.206
Girl, don't be saying shit
that I didn't say.

02:38.275 --> 02:39.655
I wasn't disappointed.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.689
I just genuinely wanted to know
what I can do better,

02:41.758 --> 02:44.172
because I watched the only
two girls left in my group

02:44.241 --> 02:45.620
be in the top.

02:45.689 --> 02:47.206
And I felt like I did
pretty strong in the challenge,

02:47.275 --> 02:48.586
so I just wanted to know

02:48.655 --> 02:50.275
what could have elevated me
to that next spot.

02:50.344 --> 02:52.482
I am happy with being safe.

02:52.551 --> 02:54.241
-I'm not complaining.
-I'm just gonna say this.

02:54.310 --> 02:55.896
Yell at me again,
I'm gonna beat your ass.

02:55.965 --> 02:57.965
-Okay, so Maddy--
-Ooh, okay.

02:58.034 --> 02:59.827
I will agree with DeJa.

02:59.896 --> 03:02.034
Daya is really, really bitter.

03:02.103 --> 03:05.206
You could switch her name from
Daya Betty to Bitter Betty.

03:05.275 --> 03:08.482
Okay, girls, let's get
the fuck out.

03:11.689 --> 03:13.758
Get me outta this!

03:13.827 --> 03:15.758
I think that part of why

03:15.827 --> 03:17.379
we're seeing
little rifts kind of happen

03:17.448 --> 03:20.206
is because the competition
is starting to heat up.

03:20.275 --> 03:21.896
You know, the room
is getting a little smaller,

03:21.965 --> 03:23.241
girls are getting picked off,

03:23.310 --> 03:26.172
eaten like
old shaggy fruit, bitch.

03:26.241 --> 03:28.517
-Aah!
-Owie.

03:28.586 --> 03:31.448
Chile, all y'all ho's
better watch out,

03:31.517 --> 03:34.000
because it's not personal,
it's drag,

03:34.068 --> 03:37.379
and we are not here
to lose, period.

03:44.827 --> 03:46.413
The winner
ofRuPaul's Drag Race

03:46.482 --> 03:47.931
receives a one-year supply

03:48.000 --> 03:50.379
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics

03:50.448 --> 03:55.517
and a grand prize of $100,000,
powered by Cash App.

03:55.586 --> 03:58.655
With extra-special guest judge
Taraji P. Henson.

04:07.827 --> 04:09.586
-Aah!
-Oh, my God!

04:09.655 --> 04:11.000
It's a new day, ooh!

04:11.068 --> 04:12.241
Make the bitch holler.

04:12.310 --> 04:13.551
It's a new day in the werkroom,

04:13.620 --> 04:16.172
and I'm inching closer
and closer to a win.

04:16.241 --> 04:19.172
And it is just, like,
teasing the fuck out of me,

04:19.241 --> 04:22.758
so I'm really coming in needing
to just, like, kill it today.

04:22.827 --> 04:24.034
I have to say, though,

04:24.103 --> 04:25.517
that Spring runway,
that was sickening.

04:25.586 --> 04:27.482
-It was.
-Oh, my God.

04:27.551 --> 04:29.517
-We all looked so good.
-I don't think there's been

04:29.586 --> 04:31.103
one bad thing
on the runway yet, honestly.

04:31.172 --> 04:32.965
-Well...
-Well...

04:33.034 --> 04:34.379
If you can't see the booger...

04:37.034 --> 04:38.586
Hello, hello, hello!

04:40.655 --> 04:42.689
Ladykins!

04:42.758 --> 04:44.379
-Hi!
-Hello!

04:44.448 --> 04:45.827
At this point
in the competition,

04:45.896 --> 04:48.448
I feel like
we've become close enough

04:48.517 --> 04:50.689
that I can confide in you.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.000
-Aw.
-It's okay.

04:52.068 --> 04:55.413
It's about...

04:55.482 --> 04:56.793
Michelle Visage.

04:56.862 --> 04:59.034
We've recently discovered

04:59.103 --> 05:03.241
that she's been compulsively
shopping online late nights.

05:03.310 --> 05:08.896
Turns out she was under
the influence of sleeping pills.

05:08.965 --> 05:11.448
Have you ever heard
of Glambien?

05:11.517 --> 05:13.310
-Oh, yeah.
-Gets you every time.

05:13.379 --> 05:14.344
Mm-hmm.

05:14.413 --> 05:15.379
Well, the good news is

05:15.448 --> 05:18.068
Michelle has kicked the habit,

05:18.137 --> 05:23.724
thanks to her time
at the Acid Betty Ford Center.

05:23.793 --> 05:26.379
Now we just need to deal with

05:26.448 --> 05:29.620
the wreckage
of her shopping past.

05:32.827 --> 05:34.310
-Whoo!
-Whoo!

05:34.379 --> 05:36.241
-Oh!
-Delivery boys.

05:36.310 --> 05:39.068
-Oh, my God.
-Wow.

05:39.137 --> 05:41.655
Ooh, y'all brought us packages!

05:42.931 --> 05:44.758
Hey, daddy!

05:44.827 --> 05:47.620
Ladies, for this week's
maxi-challenge,

05:47.689 --> 05:50.482
you need to create
unforgettable looks

05:50.551 --> 05:53.724
using the only
the unconventional materials

05:53.793 --> 05:56.931
found in these
Glamazon Prime packages.

05:57.000 --> 05:57.931
Yes!

05:58.000 --> 06:00.413
This is what I live for.

06:00.482 --> 06:03.965
It is classic Daya Betty
Frankenstein drag,

06:04.034 --> 06:05.551
taking a whole bunch of shit

06:05.620 --> 06:08.896
and mushing it together
to create a fantastic look.

06:08.965 --> 06:13.068
Oh, and the packages
in the Pit Crew's underwear

06:13.137 --> 06:15.068
are strictly off-limits.

06:15.137 --> 06:16.758
-Oh!
-Oh!

06:16.827 --> 06:19.758
Racers, start your engines,

06:19.827 --> 06:23.206
and may the best drag queen win.

06:25.068 --> 06:26.689
Oh, my God!

06:26.758 --> 06:28.862
Can you get
your ass off of me?

06:28.931 --> 06:32.344
We are diving in there, tearing
shit open, we're screaming.

06:32.413 --> 06:33.862
It's a free-for-all.

06:33.931 --> 06:35.068
What is in here!

06:35.137 --> 06:36.344
-Oh, okay.
-Sorry.

06:36.413 --> 06:37.827
Because I wasn't looking
at that box, bitch.

06:37.896 --> 06:40.206
After the last sewing challenge,

06:40.275 --> 06:42.586
I was boo-hoo hurt
that I did not win.

06:42.655 --> 06:46.034
I'm really mad at myself
for, like, not doing everything.

06:48.103 --> 06:49.689
So I hoarded the most

06:49.758 --> 06:52.965
because I wanna make sure
I have enough boxes

06:53.034 --> 06:56.620
to have some type of material
that I want.

06:56.689 --> 06:57.896
These are mine!

06:57.965 --> 06:59.034
Imagine that.

06:59.103 --> 07:00.172
Look at this shit.

07:00.241 --> 07:01.275
Some fur.

07:01.344 --> 07:02.379
Sprinkles?

07:02.448 --> 07:04.206
Ooh, Sunday Riley.

07:04.275 --> 07:06.655
Good Genes.
I love this stuff.

07:06.724 --> 07:09.206
Girl, this is all
school supplies.

07:09.275 --> 07:10.862
Have y'all ever, like,

07:10.931 --> 07:14.103
went to a Christmas party
at your step-parents'

07:14.172 --> 07:16.206
and you thought you were
getting something great.

07:16.275 --> 07:17.793
Like, you were, like,
oh, my God,

07:17.862 --> 07:19.448
they're gonna spoil me
so much

07:19.517 --> 07:21.068
because, like,
I'm new to the family.

07:21.137 --> 07:23.827
And then you open the box
and it's, like, socks.

07:23.896 --> 07:27.034
And then it's also,
like, deodorant.

07:27.103 --> 07:28.586
And the most expensive gift
up in there

07:28.655 --> 07:31.551
is a Sonic toothbrush, bitch,
and you can't even resell it

07:31.620 --> 07:33.689
because they scratched out
the resale label

07:33.758 --> 07:35.000
because they want you
to use it.

07:35.068 --> 07:37.000
That's how it feels.

07:37.068 --> 07:38.310
It feels like
Christmas gone wrong.

07:38.379 --> 07:40.413
Okay.

07:40.482 --> 07:42.379
A little bit of structure.

07:42.448 --> 07:45.068
Finally some things
I can do stuff with.

07:45.137 --> 07:46.517
Anybody need these for later?

07:46.586 --> 07:48.034
-Wait.

07:48.103 --> 07:49.310
What the fuck?

07:49.379 --> 07:51.517
Oh, my.

07:51.586 --> 07:53.000
Ooh, Camden,
that looks beautiful.

07:53.068 --> 07:54.241
Okay, Camden!

07:54.310 --> 07:55.413
Oh, bitch, that's sickening.

07:55.482 --> 07:56.655
I start to notice

07:56.724 --> 07:59.379
that I have a few
pastel, colorful things,

07:59.448 --> 08:01.655
and so I go, okay, it's not
four-way stretch fabric,

08:01.724 --> 08:04.310
but they look like they could
live in the same universe.

08:04.379 --> 08:06.413
Great. So I just go,
okay, grab that.

08:06.482 --> 08:10.310
Oh, yes, I got fabric!

08:10.379 --> 08:11.931
-You took everything, ho!
-I know.

08:18.586 --> 08:22.448
Ow. I can't open these.
I just broke a nail.

08:22.517 --> 08:26.379
I'm, like, having trouble
even opening the boxes,

08:26.448 --> 08:28.241
because my fingers
are fucking me up.

08:28.310 --> 08:30.586
Okay, I'm gonna need
some stuff from somebody,

08:30.655 --> 08:32.551
because I can't open
a single fucking box.

08:32.620 --> 08:35.448
So I'm just trying to grab
whatever people already opened.

08:35.517 --> 08:37.103
So if someone's, like,
throwing, like,

08:37.172 --> 08:38.517
"I don't want this one,"
like, I'll take it.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.413
So I'm kind of left
with everyone else's scraps.

08:41.482 --> 08:44.034
Is anyone using this one yet?

08:44.103 --> 08:46.965
I feel like a little sewer rat,
scavenging amongst the trash.

08:47.034 --> 08:49.275
It's like mmn-mmn-mmn.
What can I get?

08:49.344 --> 08:51.379
And I'm starting to panic
a little bit,

08:51.448 --> 08:52.413
but I'm trying
to keep it at bay.

08:54.931 --> 08:57.896
I'm excited, because
when I usually make stuff,

08:57.965 --> 08:59.448
I make stuff like this.

08:59.517 --> 09:02.137
I go to thrift stores and just
find tablecloths and shit.

09:02.206 --> 09:03.655
So I feel
very in my wheelhouse.

09:03.724 --> 09:07.793
The goal for today
is to be in the top.

09:07.862 --> 09:09.862
I am tired of being safe.

09:09.931 --> 09:13.379
I wanna be noticed. I want
people to remember who Daya is.

09:13.448 --> 09:15.275
Are you using this pink?

09:15.344 --> 09:17.000
-No.
-Okay, I'm stealing.

09:17.068 --> 09:18.931
I have been a team player

09:19.000 --> 09:20.793
and I've been getting along
with the girls,

09:20.862 --> 09:22.413
and I feel like
maybe I've been focused

09:22.482 --> 09:24.586
on getting along
with the girls too much.

09:24.655 --> 09:26.241
Sometimes you need
to be selfish.

09:26.310 --> 09:30.482
Color-palette wise, this is
kind of just the inspiration.

09:30.551 --> 09:32.275
I'm gonna go
a little more kooky.

09:32.344 --> 09:35.620
I think I'm gonna do,
like, a big babydoll.

09:35.689 --> 09:37.793
Just a big baby...
like Jasmine.

09:42.758 --> 09:45.758
I feel like I have a lot of
ideas happening in my head,

09:45.827 --> 09:49.517
but I just need to trust
wherever my instincts go.

09:49.586 --> 09:51.793
And right now,
I'm feeling like a baby.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.413
-A baby?
-Yeah.

09:54.482 --> 09:57.068
At this point
I'm really struggling,

09:57.137 --> 09:58.758
because basically I ended up

09:58.827 --> 10:00.068
with a bunch of shit
that I don't want.

10:00.137 --> 10:02.206
And like, okay,
I think I'm gonna go,

10:02.275 --> 10:04.310
like, the babydoll route.

10:04.379 --> 10:05.379
Willow.

10:07.241 --> 10:09.206
I just wanted to show you

10:09.275 --> 10:12.344
I'm kind of doing
a babydoll thing.

10:12.413 --> 10:13.758
Fuck.

10:15.655 --> 10:18.310
I'm just letting you know
that babydoll idea,

10:18.379 --> 10:19.551
I'm claiming it now.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.827
Daya is so hungry for a win,

10:21.896 --> 10:23.896
I think she would
literally eat a human.

10:23.965 --> 10:25.931
If you show up
in a babydoll dress, bitch--

10:26.000 --> 10:27.000
I am not gonna show up
in a babydoll dress.

10:27.068 --> 10:28.103
I'll come for you.

10:28.172 --> 10:30.275
All right, good talk.

10:30.344 --> 10:31.896
Oh, fuck.

10:31.965 --> 10:33.482
I have no idea what I'm doing,

10:33.551 --> 10:37.344
but I do love suspense stories,
so we'll see.

10:40.172 --> 10:41.206
Coming up...

10:41.275 --> 10:42.689
Oh, hi, queens!

10:43.758 --> 10:45.689
You're fan-girling already.

10:47.275 --> 10:48.724
I really just wanna have,
like, a coordinated outfit

10:48.793 --> 10:50.206
with, like, the little, like,
blow-up doll or something.

10:50.275 --> 10:53.655
Girl, I'm a little scared
right now.

11:03.310 --> 11:05.620
What's in the box?

11:05.689 --> 11:07.551
This week's maxi-challenge

11:07.620 --> 11:12.206
is the "Glamazon Prime sewing
challenge creation creativity

11:12.275 --> 11:15.586
get me the hell outta here
because I don't sew" moment.

11:15.655 --> 11:16.862
I think this is gonna be

11:16.931 --> 11:19.275
a hot glue
more than sewing moment.

11:19.344 --> 11:20.655
I just wanna know
what the hell Michelle Visage

11:20.724 --> 11:22.068
thought she was gonna do
with all this?

11:22.137 --> 11:25.137
I know. She was gonna bake,
she was gonna fix a car.

11:25.206 --> 11:27.000
Michelle was shopping
late at night.

11:27.068 --> 11:29.586
Girl, what kind of
sleep paralysis demon

11:29.655 --> 11:33.655
shops for fucking PVC,
barbed wire?

11:33.724 --> 11:37.482
What the hell am I gonna do
with three umbrellas,

11:37.551 --> 11:38.931
a shower curtain?

11:39.000 --> 11:41.103
Like, what the hell
you gonna make with all that,

11:41.172 --> 11:43.379
some kind of Bill Nye
the Science Guy experiment?

11:43.448 --> 11:45.275
Bitch, I failed science.

11:48.413 --> 11:50.344
Oh! Oh!

11:50.413 --> 11:52.172
I did not expect that.

11:52.241 --> 11:54.551
So the things that I gravitate
towards most

11:54.620 --> 11:56.413
in the boxes I am opening
are the yarn.

11:56.482 --> 12:00.586
I also got these amazing
over-bed canopies

12:00.655 --> 12:02.137
in purple and in red.

12:02.206 --> 12:04.482
Oh, yeah.
Oh, I got two, perfect!

12:04.551 --> 12:05.931
I'm trying to do something

12:06.000 --> 12:09.655
that is not something
that is so typical Jasmine,

12:09.724 --> 12:14.137
but at the same time giving
a cohesive and streamlined look.

12:14.206 --> 12:15.517
And I'm gonna use those
as a belt,

12:15.586 --> 12:18.206
and I'm gonna try to drape
as much as possible.

12:18.275 --> 12:20.689
I wanna incorporate these
on my outfit.

12:20.758 --> 12:23.034
I may do knitted,
like, this all knitted,

12:23.103 --> 12:24.344
like with this stuff,

12:24.413 --> 12:26.241
and do, like, crisscross
and, like, gluing it.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.620
This is the
"if I have time" part.

12:27.689 --> 12:28.827
All right.

12:28.896 --> 12:32.655
Girl, Jasmine
got something to prove.

12:32.724 --> 12:34.931
After the ball challenge,

12:35.000 --> 12:38.931
obviously Miss Thing was
a little salty about being safe.

12:39.000 --> 12:42.241
Are you aiming to win
this sewing challenge?

12:42.310 --> 12:43.379
-I'm not.

12:43.448 --> 12:45.896
In the back of my mind,
I'd love to,

12:45.965 --> 12:48.793
but I ain't gonna be bitter
if I don't this time.

12:48.862 --> 12:50.758
No tears left to cry
in this one, mama.

12:52.586 --> 12:55.965
Sewing challenge,
who was in the bottom?

12:56.034 --> 12:57.413
June and...

12:57.482 --> 12:58.793
-And Maddy.
-Maddy.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.793
-How you feeling, Maddy?
-How you feeling, sister?

13:00.862 --> 13:02.172
I don't wanna talk about it.

13:02.241 --> 13:03.689
She goes, "I don't
wanna talk about it!"

13:03.758 --> 13:05.896
This is bringing up
a lot of trauma for me.

13:05.965 --> 13:08.206
I'm feeling a little bit
triggered at this point,

13:08.275 --> 13:10.379
because I know that
I am not the best seamstress,

13:10.448 --> 13:13.241
and I know I don't have,
like, the best eye for design.

13:13.310 --> 13:14.551
I have all these, like,
different, like, color options

13:14.620 --> 13:16.000
to, like, play with.

13:16.068 --> 13:17.517
I think I'm gonna start
with just, like, cutting these,

13:17.586 --> 13:18.793
and just, like, sewing

13:18.862 --> 13:20.068
the different one colored ones
together.

13:20.137 --> 13:21.482
The main thing that I grabbed

13:21.551 --> 13:23.241
was all these
different colored aprons.

13:23.310 --> 13:24.724
With that, I feel like
I can really create

13:24.793 --> 13:26.413
a very color block garment.

13:26.482 --> 13:27.310
But I also have...

13:28.379 --> 13:30.379
an inflatable doll.

13:30.448 --> 13:32.103
I really just wanna have,
like, a coordinated outfit

13:32.172 --> 13:33.689
with, like, the little,
like, blow-up doll or something.

13:33.758 --> 13:35.793
Maybe just, like,
matching, colorful,

13:35.862 --> 13:37.551
like, a dress or something.

13:38.862 --> 13:41.655
Oh...

13:43.586 --> 13:45.586
Hey, squirrel friends.

13:45.655 --> 13:47.482
-Hi!
-Hey!

13:47.551 --> 13:50.482
You know, it's bring
your daughter to work day,

13:50.551 --> 13:52.482
but since I don't
have a daughter,

13:52.551 --> 13:54.068
I brought Carson!

13:54.137 --> 13:57.068
Oh, hi, queens.

13:57.137 --> 13:58.862
Whatcha unpacking?

14:00.655 --> 14:01.862
Jorgeous!

14:01.931 --> 14:04.448
You know, Jorgeous
was born to do drag.

14:04.517 --> 14:05.551
Uh-huh.

14:05.620 --> 14:08.000
This is the child prodigy.

14:08.068 --> 14:10.862
-Who, me?
-Punky Brewster does drag.

14:10.931 --> 14:12.551
Yes. Okay, bitch,

14:12.620 --> 14:14.724
you were in the bottom
last week,

14:14.793 --> 14:17.310
and it was glorious.

14:17.379 --> 14:18.413
How are you gonna make sure

14:18.482 --> 14:20.655
you're not in the bottom
this week,

14:20.724 --> 14:23.172
although I gotta say,
if you are,

14:23.241 --> 14:24.448
it wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world.

14:24.517 --> 14:26.793
No, like, you can't
wish that upon me.

14:26.862 --> 14:29.275
-No, I'm not.
-You cannot wish that upon me!

14:29.344 --> 14:31.034
So what are you doing
with this?

14:31.103 --> 14:33.344
Honestly, these two colors
really, like, caught my eye,

14:33.413 --> 14:35.068
and I wanna give something,
like, kind of dark,

14:35.137 --> 14:37.000
because lately I've just
been kind of, like, glamorous.

14:37.068 --> 14:38.586
Oh, I hate glamorous.

14:38.655 --> 14:40.310
Oh, it's the worst.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.241
No, but I just need to make sure
everything fits right, so--

14:42.310 --> 14:44.310
Yeah, there was--
you've had some fit issues.

14:44.379 --> 14:45.586
Yeah.

14:45.655 --> 14:47.482
A lot of your tops
have been falling down.

14:47.551 --> 14:48.965
You're constantly
hoisting them up.

14:49.034 --> 14:51.310
That's an easy fix,
but a huge distraction.

14:51.379 --> 14:52.586
-Yes.
-A huge distraction

14:52.655 --> 14:54.000
away from the talent.

14:54.068 --> 14:57.068
You have some very
inexpensive-looking items here.

14:57.137 --> 14:59.000
It's really important
to make it look elevated.

14:59.068 --> 15:00.172
You don't have to do a lot.

15:00.241 --> 15:01.379
Oh, yes.

15:01.448 --> 15:03.275
You've got all the goods
to sell it.

15:03.344 --> 15:04.551
But I would make sure
it looks elevated.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.517
Of course.

15:06.586 --> 15:09.413
My girl Jorgeous, you know,

15:09.482 --> 15:11.965
I feel like
she is kind of unsure

15:12.034 --> 15:14.310
when it comes to the materials.

15:14.379 --> 15:15.620
Thank God she has a tiny body

15:15.689 --> 15:16.896
and she doesn't have to worry
about that much

15:16.965 --> 15:19.413
about covering
a lot of surface area.

15:19.482 --> 15:21.241
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

15:21.310 --> 15:22.551
Kerri Colby.

15:22.620 --> 15:24.965
Now, this is really cute.

15:25.034 --> 15:26.620
Did you do this already?

15:26.689 --> 15:29.172
Yes. At first, when
I was looking at my boxes,

15:29.241 --> 15:31.172
I was, like, what the fuck?

15:31.241 --> 15:33.482
And then I kind of
just started, I don't know--

15:33.551 --> 15:35.344
Sculpting.
You're sculpting.

15:35.413 --> 15:37.793
Where did your sense of style
come from?

15:37.862 --> 15:40.793
I've always, like--

15:40.862 --> 15:42.241
I feel like
I had to kind of, like,

15:42.310 --> 15:44.655
pull myself together
to have some sort of aesthetic.

15:44.724 --> 15:46.827
And I used to get
pretty made fun of,

15:46.896 --> 15:48.931
so I always would,
like, make sure

15:49.000 --> 15:52.379
that if I looked funny
to people, my clothes wouldn't.

15:52.448 --> 15:54.827
You used to get made fun of
by the kids at school?

15:54.896 --> 15:56.413
Oh, yeah.

15:56.482 --> 15:58.620
And do you still carry
the hurt from that?

15:58.689 --> 16:02.275
There's definitely
a little bit of scar tissue,

16:02.344 --> 16:05.413
and that kind of pops up
every now and then.

16:05.482 --> 16:07.689
Like, I have a fear
of rejection.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.344
Well, you always look gorgeous.

16:09.413 --> 16:10.379
Thank you.

16:10.448 --> 16:11.655
A bit restrained.

16:11.724 --> 16:14.413
Everything is very tailored
and poised.

16:14.482 --> 16:15.758
It's like
you wanna be so perfect

16:15.827 --> 16:17.724
that nobody can,
like, find any holes.

16:17.793 --> 16:18.827
-Yeah.
-Like, you know,

16:18.896 --> 16:20.379
this is
a perfect opportunity

16:20.448 --> 16:23.689
for you to create something
and let loose a little bit.

16:23.758 --> 16:29.448
You know, it's a way to reclaim
what was taken away back there.

16:29.517 --> 16:30.517
For sure.

16:30.586 --> 16:31.551
All right, Miss Kerri Colby.

16:31.620 --> 16:33.413
Thank you.

16:33.482 --> 16:34.896
Maddy Morphosis.

16:34.965 --> 16:36.586
-Hi.
-Well, hellur.

16:36.655 --> 16:37.931
Let's talk about your outfit,

16:38.000 --> 16:40.379
that sort of big,
flouncy dress thing.

16:40.448 --> 16:41.448
It's like a hostess gown.

16:41.517 --> 16:42.896
It's like a hostess gown.

16:42.965 --> 16:45.000
And very seventies.

16:45.068 --> 16:46.931
Was that what you
were going for, or--

16:47.000 --> 16:48.103
It wasn't originally.

16:48.172 --> 16:49.551
I originally
came up with the idea

16:49.620 --> 16:51.586
of doing something very,
like, nineties color blocking.

16:51.655 --> 16:53.034
And as I was creating it,

16:53.103 --> 16:56.448
it wasn't exactly, like,
the idea I had in my head.

16:56.517 --> 16:57.724
So I'm just kind of going

16:57.793 --> 16:59.758
where I have an old country feel
with patchwork.

16:59.827 --> 17:01.034
Uh-huh.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.344
Going for more,
like, that vibe.

17:02.413 --> 17:03.896
And I have, like, this hat,

17:03.965 --> 17:04.862
and I thought about maybe,
like, doing more just, like--

17:04.931 --> 17:06.517
-Like Minnie Pearl?
-Uh-huh.

17:06.586 --> 17:08.000
I mean,
give it a point of view.

17:08.068 --> 17:10.103
So I don't care
if it's a country woman

17:10.172 --> 17:11.758
with flowers in her hair

17:11.827 --> 17:15.241
or if it's, you know,
1970s Palm Beach socialite.

17:15.310 --> 17:16.413
Right.

17:16.482 --> 17:17.896
-Make sure we know what it is.
-Mm-hmm.

17:17.965 --> 17:19.586
I think you just need
to go bigger with everything.

17:19.655 --> 17:21.517
Just let yourself go.
Feel the fantasy.

17:21.586 --> 17:24.448
-Okay.
-Because you're in drag, man.

17:24.517 --> 17:28.000
It's all about this area
right here, Maddy.

17:28.068 --> 17:30.206
Mm-hmm, and if it's on fire
or not.

17:30.275 --> 17:32.689
Is your pussy on fire?

17:32.758 --> 17:35.379
Is my pussy on fire?

17:35.448 --> 17:37.000
It's warming up.
It's warming up.

17:37.068 --> 17:38.448
Oh! Well, bitch,
now's the time.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.068
-It's kindling, yeah.
-You better strike a match.

17:40.137 --> 17:42.379
I'm here in this competition
for a reason,

17:42.448 --> 17:44.586
and it wasn't because I played
it safe in my audition video.

17:44.655 --> 17:47.586
It's because I took risks,
I showed who I was,

17:47.655 --> 17:49.068
and I feel like Ru
is telling me right now

17:49.137 --> 17:51.379
that I need to do that
on the main stage.

17:51.448 --> 17:52.689
Think about what I said.

17:52.758 --> 17:54.275
-Yes, ma'am.
-All right.

17:54.344 --> 17:56.482
Angeria, come on over here.

17:56.551 --> 17:58.103
We got company, honey.

17:58.172 --> 17:59.379
-Hello!
-Hello!

17:59.448 --> 18:02.000
-Hello there.
-Your fan-girling already.

18:02.068 --> 18:04.448
Tell Carson
what you're doing.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.586
This really stood out to me.

18:05.655 --> 18:08.448
I saw it and I was,
like, structure.

18:08.517 --> 18:12.000
I wanna take more of, like, less
pageant and more, like, fashion.

18:12.068 --> 18:13.827
So you're gonna do
a sculptural dress look.

18:13.896 --> 18:16.931
Yes, it's most
like rich couture.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.344
I mean, this is very heavy, too,
so I would just be very careful

18:20.413 --> 18:22.103
of how you're attaching this
to the dress

18:22.172 --> 18:24.137
so we don't have a floppy fan.

18:24.206 --> 18:25.517
Right. Yeah.

18:25.586 --> 18:27.137
And what was this?
It was drapes or something?

18:27.206 --> 18:28.379
-Yes.
-Wow, okay.

18:28.448 --> 18:29.758
It's not stretchy, is it?

18:29.827 --> 18:31.068
It's not.

18:31.137 --> 18:33.068
Well, why would you do that
to yourself?

18:33.137 --> 18:35.793
Well, mama, the boxes don't
have much things that stretch.

18:35.862 --> 18:37.172
But it's okay.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.344
I've worked with things
that don't stretch before.

18:39.413 --> 18:40.482
Oh, okay.

18:40.551 --> 18:41.931
You're a braver woman
than I am.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.448
Hey, gotta do
what you gotta do.

18:43.517 --> 18:45.275
Okay. Well,
thank you very much.

18:45.344 --> 18:46.896
-Bye.
-Bye.

18:46.965 --> 18:50.620
-The black fabric's a little...
-That's tricky.

18:50.689 --> 18:52.206
It's a little stiff,
and it's lined,

18:52.275 --> 18:53.482
so I'm hoping
she takes the lining out.

18:53.551 --> 18:54.517
Yeah.

18:54.586 --> 18:56.655
I know that Ru and Carson

18:56.724 --> 18:59.344
have the microscope on me,

18:59.413 --> 19:01.931
and I'm a little scared.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.137
QI'm a little scared right now.

19:05.965 --> 19:07.482
Coming up...

19:07.551 --> 19:11.137
Is there anything that you wanna
see particularly more from me?

19:11.206 --> 19:13.241
Daya asked the question,

19:13.310 --> 19:15.379
and she got the answer
she did not want.

19:15.448 --> 19:18.000
Who the fuck told you
it was okay?

19:26.724 --> 19:29.206
Lady Camden.

19:29.275 --> 19:30.896
-Hi.
-Hello!

19:30.965 --> 19:32.655
These are your found items

19:32.724 --> 19:33.896
from Michelle's
midnight ordering.

19:33.965 --> 19:35.758
-Yeah.
-I love that lining thing.

19:35.827 --> 19:37.482
That's very Bob Mackie.

19:37.551 --> 19:39.655
-This terrycloth?
-Yeah.

19:39.724 --> 19:42.793
This is, like, a kid's
paddling pool material.

19:42.862 --> 19:43.931
So I just kind of cut it up.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.517
And I know that
because of the material,

19:45.586 --> 19:48.172
it's not gonna lie
super beautiful and flat,

19:48.241 --> 19:49.655
so I figured
if I covered it with this,

19:49.724 --> 19:52.310
it gives it some texture
that kind of conceal.

19:52.379 --> 19:53.689
-Oh, right, yeah.
-Right, right.

19:53.758 --> 19:55.137
Yeah, have you ever made
anything like this before?

19:55.206 --> 19:56.551
I have.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.137
It's always a little,
you know, glued together,

19:59.206 --> 20:00.551
a little jury-rigged.

20:00.620 --> 20:01.896
So my challenge with this

20:01.965 --> 20:03.965
is to make it look refined
and like a real--

20:04.034 --> 20:06.896
-Finished.
-Yeah, finished, yeah.

20:06.965 --> 20:09.931
You know what I notice about you
is that you need a bigger lip.

20:10.000 --> 20:14.931
Because we lose your mouth,
because you have a strong chin.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.206
Yes.

20:16.275 --> 20:18.206
You know,
you have a strong nose.

20:18.275 --> 20:20.517
So you just need a little bit
more lip, you know?

20:20.586 --> 20:21.448
Okay. I thought
you were telling me

20:21.517 --> 20:22.724
to get an injection.

20:22.793 --> 20:24.000
I was like, "Is there
someone on-site?"

20:24.068 --> 20:26.448
You did very well last week.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.310
-No wins yet.
-No wins.

20:28.379 --> 20:29.724
I feel
like I was close.

20:29.793 --> 20:32.172
Getting close just gave me
a little taste of it,

20:32.241 --> 20:33.862
so I'm like, unh!

20:33.931 --> 20:35.827
This is an opportunity
to go for a win here.

20:35.896 --> 20:38.241
Okay.
I know I did pretty well

20:38.310 --> 20:39.724
last time we did
the design challenge,

20:39.793 --> 20:41.827
but this time I know
I need to step it up

20:41.896 --> 20:43.241
by giving it more drama.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.793
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you.

20:44.862 --> 20:47.896
And I feel like I have such
a drive and focus right now.

20:47.965 --> 20:50.172
I really, really,
really want to win.

20:50.241 --> 20:52.241
Jasmine Kennedie.

20:52.310 --> 20:55.758
Now, Carson, whatever you do,
don't mention Chappaquiddick.

20:55.827 --> 20:56.758
I won't.

20:56.827 --> 20:58.344
-Hi.
-Hi!

20:58.413 --> 20:59.724
Now, you got a lot of stuff.

20:59.793 --> 21:03.103
You've got some very gauzy--
is it tulle there?

21:03.172 --> 21:06.517
These were actually,
like, over-bed canopies.

21:06.586 --> 21:08.000
-Okay.
-Oh!

21:08.068 --> 21:09.103
-Like a mosquito net.
-Yeah.

21:09.172 --> 21:10.655
-Ooh, I love that.
-Mm-hmm.

21:10.724 --> 21:12.827
And I was thinking of layer them
on top of each other.

21:12.896 --> 21:14.275
-Uh-huh.
-This is, like, a rough sketch.

21:14.344 --> 21:17.137
But it's gonna be a halter top
that goes to the back.

21:17.206 --> 21:18.793
And then from here,

21:18.862 --> 21:20.689
I wanted to do, like,
a very, very high slit.

21:20.758 --> 21:21.965
Wait, what did you call me?

21:22.034 --> 21:24.379
You high slit!

21:24.448 --> 21:26.482
But I wanted to do
something more flowy

21:26.551 --> 21:28.827
because I've done a lot
of fitted stuff for y'all.

21:28.896 --> 21:30.344
So I wanted to show,
like, a little bit more,

21:30.413 --> 21:32.206
like, Sex and the City
Samantha vibes.

21:32.275 --> 21:34.379
Going, like, out to Abu Dhabi.

21:34.448 --> 21:36.724
-Ooh, Abu Dhabi realness.
-Yeah.

21:36.793 --> 21:38.413
I think this could be
really amazing,

21:38.482 --> 21:40.034
but also, don't make it
too complicated.

21:40.103 --> 21:41.310
Like, I heard a lot of

21:41.379 --> 21:42.482
"I'm gonna do this,
I'm gonna do that."

21:42.551 --> 21:43.758
-You don't have tons of time.
-Right.

21:43.827 --> 21:47.931
So I would edit it down
to what you can do,

21:48.000 --> 21:49.724
and do it beautifully.

21:49.793 --> 21:52.068
All right.
Thank you so much.

21:52.137 --> 21:53.931
Thank you, thank you.
Off we go to work.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.241
All right, Carson,
she don't want no big pill.

21:56.310 --> 21:58.517
-No!
-She want a Willow Pill.

21:58.586 --> 22:00.517
Oh, a widdle, tiny pill.

22:00.586 --> 22:02.551
Hewwo. How are we?

22:02.620 --> 22:04.344
The first time I saw you

22:04.413 --> 22:07.655
I think was the ball challenge,
which you won.

22:07.724 --> 22:09.068
Yes.

22:09.137 --> 22:10.482
And you gave us
very, like, tailored.

22:10.551 --> 22:11.931
You gave us, you know,
Boca Raton realtor.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.206
You gave us the jumpsuit.

22:13.275 --> 22:15.620
Oh, my goodness,
that jumpsuit.

22:15.689 --> 22:17.172
Stuff that I would be, like,

22:17.241 --> 22:19.482
oh, you should be designing for,
like, a major fashion label.

22:19.551 --> 22:20.931
Oh, thank you.

22:21.000 --> 22:25.586
So you have a body bag
on a dress form.

22:25.655 --> 22:28.172
Yeah, I have these sleeves.

22:28.241 --> 22:30.310
The idea is to be, like,
a child's nightmare.

22:30.379 --> 22:31.793
-Ooh!
-Uh-huh.

22:31.862 --> 22:34.379
To be, like, a monster
in, like, a baby girl's room.

22:34.448 --> 22:35.517
Do you have nightmares often?

22:35.586 --> 22:36.689
I have a lot of stress dreams

22:36.758 --> 22:38.034
about what's going on here.

22:38.103 --> 22:39.793
Are you stressed out
in this competition?

22:39.862 --> 22:40.931
When I'm awake, no.

22:41.000 --> 22:42.137
When I'm asleep,
yes, very much.

22:42.206 --> 22:43.413
Really?

22:43.482 --> 22:45.655
And so I guess this
is an emulation of that.

22:45.724 --> 22:49.517
Okay, so this is a long-armed,
glamorous monster.

22:49.586 --> 22:51.689
Well, what's the middle part
gonna be?

22:51.758 --> 22:54.482
That's the part that
I'm having to figure out more.

22:54.551 --> 22:57.344
You have this very elaborate
arm thing,

22:57.413 --> 22:59.241
and that you're gonna have to,
like, mechanically figure out.

22:59.310 --> 23:02.689
You probably need to keep
the rest of it pretty simple

23:02.758 --> 23:04.000
-so you can finish.
-Yes.

23:04.068 --> 23:05.655
This one, I am
a little bit more afraid

23:05.724 --> 23:07.206
that it's not gonna work out,

23:07.275 --> 23:10.793
just because I am more behind,
and it is more ambitious.

23:10.862 --> 23:12.241
We're just at a point
in this competition

23:12.310 --> 23:14.482
where you cannot slip up.

23:14.551 --> 23:15.724
I cannot wait to see it.

23:15.793 --> 23:18.448
I know if I
can finish this outfit,

23:18.517 --> 23:19.862
it'll be a show-stopper.

23:19.931 --> 23:22.068
But until then,

23:22.137 --> 23:24.413
my butthole's
gonna be clenched.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.517
-Hi, guys. Hello.
-Daya Betty.

23:27.586 --> 23:29.862
-Say hello to Carson.
-Hi, Carson.

23:29.931 --> 23:31.448
Hi. So what are you creating?

23:31.517 --> 23:34.137
I'm gonna do a pink
and yellow color palette

23:34.206 --> 23:38.344
kind of inspired by this
little thing that I found.

23:38.413 --> 23:39.793
It just caught my eye.

23:39.862 --> 23:42.655
It's a design challenge.
I make tons of my stuff, and--

23:42.724 --> 23:44.068
You make your own stuff?

23:44.137 --> 23:45.655
Yeah, I make, I would say,
90% of what I have.

23:45.724 --> 23:47.862
There are times where I don't
wanna go to the fabric store.

23:47.931 --> 23:49.724
It's too expensive, and
I don't have that much money.

23:49.793 --> 23:51.206
So I'll go to the thrift store

23:51.275 --> 23:53.172
and I'll get tablecloths
and I'll make stuff out of it.

23:53.241 --> 23:54.931
Right. Oh, so this should be
right up your alley.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.896
-Yes, I'm very excited.
-That's right.

23:56.965 --> 23:58.103
So you're doing, like,

23:58.172 --> 24:00.724
a babydoll
with the balloon sleeves.

24:00.793 --> 24:03.482
I'm a huge fan of ribbon, so
I'll probably add some ribbon.

24:03.551 --> 24:05.586
All right. Well, it seems
like you're on your way.

24:05.655 --> 24:08.482
So just because
I have been safe,

24:08.551 --> 24:09.758
other than my first week,

24:09.827 --> 24:11.344
I haven't really gotten
any critiques.

24:11.413 --> 24:13.689
So is there anything
that you wanna see

24:13.758 --> 24:16.275
particularly more from me?

24:17.689 --> 24:20.793
I think the big thing
is that obviously,

24:20.862 --> 24:23.241
you are, you know,
from the Haus of Methyd.

24:23.310 --> 24:25.172
And there is
a lot of similarities

24:25.241 --> 24:27.482
to you and the beloved
Crystal Methyd.

24:27.551 --> 24:29.896
For me, the makeup
on a couple of the challenges

24:29.965 --> 24:33.241
was very, very evocative
of Crystal Methyd.

24:33.310 --> 24:36.862
But we need to find out
who you are

24:36.931 --> 24:38.724
and what is your special sauce

24:38.793 --> 24:40.275
that you're bringing
to this competition.

24:40.344 --> 24:42.206
So bring us Daya Betty.

24:42.275 --> 24:44.965
Okay.
I love Crystal.

24:45.034 --> 24:47.482
She is one of my idols.

24:47.551 --> 24:48.965
But I'm not her.

24:49.034 --> 24:51.413
I think that's great advice,

24:51.482 --> 24:55.448
because here we are
six weeks into this competition.

24:55.517 --> 24:57.620
You've got to emerge.

24:57.689 --> 25:00.965
Daya asked the question, and she
got the answer she did not want.

25:01.034 --> 25:02.103
All right, thanks, Daya Betty.

25:02.172 --> 25:03.793
Thank you guys so much.
I appreciate it.

25:03.862 --> 25:05.862
And, like,
to be completely honest,

25:05.931 --> 25:08.137
I don't know if this outfit

25:08.206 --> 25:11.344
is gonna let her grow out
of this Crystal shadow.

25:12.655 --> 25:15.310
Hey, ladies, gather round.

25:15.379 --> 25:17.137
Gather round, ladies.

25:17.206 --> 25:20.000
Carson, will you do the honors?

25:20.068 --> 25:21.551
Thank you so much!

25:21.620 --> 25:24.620
Tomorrow you'll be delivering
your Glamazon Prime looks

25:24.689 --> 25:26.931
to the main stage,
where we'll be joined

25:27.000 --> 25:30.896
by our extra-special
guest judge, Taraji P. Henson.

25:33.896 --> 25:34.896
Oh, my God!

25:34.965 --> 25:37.000
Oh, my God.

25:37.068 --> 25:39.517
I am ready for Miss Cookie
to come in

25:39.586 --> 25:41.965
and just get--
oh, I'm so excited!

25:42.034 --> 25:43.551
So do you want me
to keep going?

25:43.620 --> 25:44.862
Yeah, sure, you're doing great.

25:44.931 --> 25:49.965
All right, so good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

25:52.758 --> 25:53.793
Ru, how did I do?

25:53.862 --> 25:56.137
Who the fuck told you

25:56.206 --> 25:59.620
it was okay
to say fuck on my show?

25:59.689 --> 26:03.206
You always liked Ross
better than me!

26:04.551 --> 26:06.689
And I'm not
your real daughter!

26:10.379 --> 26:13.172
Ladies, let this be
a lesson to you.

26:13.241 --> 26:14.448
Never have children.

26:14.517 --> 26:15.724
-Okay!
Q-

26:15.793 --> 26:17.137
Coming up...

26:17.206 --> 26:18.827
Oh, my gosh.

26:18.896 --> 26:20.655
It looks like
a fucking potato sack.

26:20.724 --> 26:22.517
This is out of the question.

26:22.586 --> 26:24.413
So I'm, like, no, ma'am,
we're scrapping it.

26:24.482 --> 26:25.655
No!

26:25.724 --> 26:27.103
How am I gonna do this?

26:38.586 --> 26:40.862
This week's maxi-challenge

26:40.931 --> 26:43.241
is the Glamazon Prime
design challenge,

26:43.310 --> 26:45.379
and I'm really struggling

26:45.448 --> 26:48.310
because time
is my enemy right now.

26:48.379 --> 26:50.620
Oh, no.

26:50.689 --> 26:51.931
It's hard, because
it's almost, like,

26:52.000 --> 26:54.551
sometimes if my hands
aren't working well,

26:54.620 --> 26:56.344
I'll get more flustered,

26:56.413 --> 26:58.172
and then they'll work
even less well.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.620
So I'm trying
not to get flustered.

27:00.689 --> 27:03.068
I don't wanna walk
down the runway just naked

27:03.137 --> 27:07.655
with these arms, like, whoo,
look at how beautiful I am!

27:09.896 --> 27:12.724
I'm literally doing
a step and repeat.

27:12.793 --> 27:14.793
What that mean,
"step and repeat?"

27:14.862 --> 27:16.103
When you go to, like, a venue

27:16.172 --> 27:17.689
and they have, like,
that red carpet

27:17.758 --> 27:19.551
with that, like,
billboard behind you

27:19.620 --> 27:21.482
with all the sponsors,
and you take your picture?

27:21.551 --> 27:23.310
That is a step and repeat.

27:23.379 --> 27:27.000
Oh! Too fancy for me, honey.

27:27.068 --> 27:29.689
The fact that this bitch
just has no idea

27:29.758 --> 27:31.206
about some things
that are glamorous,

27:31.275 --> 27:35.034
even though she is
a glamour queen, cracks me up.

27:35.103 --> 27:38.275
I guarantee you, 2022,
you gonna be, like,

27:38.344 --> 27:40.620
"Oh, yeah, step and repeat,
I know her well."

27:43.206 --> 27:44.586
Did you get the critique

27:44.655 --> 27:46.655
you were finally
looking for, baby?

27:46.724 --> 27:48.758
-Yes and no.
-Okay.

27:48.827 --> 27:53.448
It's like I always get compared
to Crystal, like, nonstop.

27:53.517 --> 27:56.103
And it's, like, I love her,
but it's so annoying.

27:56.172 --> 27:58.068
It gets to me,
because it's, like,

27:58.137 --> 28:00.517
I don't want you to see Crystal
when you look at me.

28:00.586 --> 28:02.931
I'm not a carbon copy
of Crystal.

28:03.000 --> 28:05.068
I mean, there are things
about my style, yes,

28:05.137 --> 28:07.448
because I come from that world.

28:07.517 --> 28:08.655
Right.

28:08.724 --> 28:10.965
But, um, I am
very different than her.

28:11.034 --> 28:13.206
And, yes, with this challenge...

28:14.931 --> 28:17.551
I am going more on the lighter
side, the brighter side.

28:17.620 --> 28:21.551
But at the end of the day,
Crystal is more playful, fun.

28:21.620 --> 28:24.241
Daya is more dark and grungy,

28:24.310 --> 28:29.000
but also still
a good party fun time.

28:29.068 --> 28:31.620
I'm gonna make
what I had planned,

28:31.689 --> 28:36.275
and then somehow distress it
and make it more my style.

28:36.344 --> 28:38.551
Just wanna make sure
that it reads Daya.

28:38.620 --> 28:40.137
Yeah.

28:40.206 --> 28:42.586
And Daya
is a distressed Crystal?

28:42.655 --> 28:45.482
I'm not
a distressed Crystal, no.

28:45.551 --> 28:47.724
But I always have more edge
than Crystal does.

28:47.793 --> 28:50.103
Crystal's more of a clown
than I am.

28:50.172 --> 28:53.448
And I didn't know Crystal
owns color, you know?

28:53.517 --> 28:56.000
Like, I didn't know she owned
polka dots and color.

28:56.068 --> 28:59.413
You know, it's like...uh.

28:59.482 --> 29:00.931
I'll tell you
one thing right now,

29:01.000 --> 29:03.206
and I don't have nothing against
Miss Daya nor no Bettical.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.241
But she's mad
that she's where she's at,

29:05.310 --> 29:06.655
and I know that really,

29:06.724 --> 29:10.137
her anger is coming from
a place of desperation, period.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.413
Hope this comes out good.

29:16.482 --> 29:20.103
I'm working with a sickening
purple, dark, fluffy blanket.

29:20.172 --> 29:21.689
Werk, Bertha.

29:21.758 --> 29:23.758
And as I'm putting it
in the sewing machine,

29:23.827 --> 29:25.896
girl, there's just fur
everywhere.

29:25.965 --> 29:28.448
Oh, my gosh.

29:28.517 --> 29:29.862
No!

29:29.931 --> 29:32.758
So I'm just like, okay,
this is gonna be an issue.

29:35.103 --> 29:37.103
Oh, no, babe.

29:37.172 --> 29:40.896
Jorgeous' outfit is shedding
all over her legs,

29:40.965 --> 29:43.000
and it's kind of looking like

29:43.068 --> 29:45.000
she just gave herself
a Brazilian

29:45.068 --> 29:46.724
and hasn't, like,
dusted off yet.

29:46.793 --> 29:48.896
Oh, my goodness.

29:48.965 --> 29:52.103
As I'm wearing it, it looks like
a fucking potato sack.

29:52.172 --> 29:54.310
It's just pulling
in the wrong places.

29:54.379 --> 29:56.724
So I'm like, bitch,
they're gonna read me fierce

29:56.793 --> 29:57.793
once I walk out the runway.

29:57.862 --> 29:59.103
This is out of the question.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.758
So I'm like, no, ma'am,
we're scrapping it.

30:05.448 --> 30:06.551
Oh, my God.

30:06.620 --> 30:09.068
Like, all these.

30:09.137 --> 30:13.413
Luckily, Angeria had, like,
this print shower curtain.

30:13.482 --> 30:14.965
Anything's better than nothing.

30:15.034 --> 30:17.000
Jorgeous, how you gonna
just take my dress

30:17.068 --> 30:18.034
and re-wear it like that?

30:20.482 --> 30:21.896
Honestly, I'm freaking out,

30:21.965 --> 30:24.689
because we have
such limited time.

30:24.758 --> 30:26.241
How am I gonna do this?

30:27.827 --> 30:29.103
Jorgeous is a dancer,

30:29.172 --> 30:32.689
so everybody is really
uncomfortable right now

30:32.758 --> 30:35.172
because if they land
in the bottom

30:35.241 --> 30:36.724
and Jorgeous is there,

30:36.793 --> 30:38.862
I do not think that
you will see them next week.

30:41.517 --> 30:42.896
Coming up...

30:42.965 --> 30:46.517
Who do y'all think
is struggling?

30:46.586 --> 30:48.241
DeJa.

30:48.310 --> 30:49.862
It just looks like
a bunch of sheets.

30:49.931 --> 30:51.310
Oh, damn.

30:51.379 --> 30:53.034
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

31:01.034 --> 31:03.172
-Whew! Whew!
-Coming down!

31:03.241 --> 31:05.517
-Let's get into it.
-Let's get painted.

31:05.586 --> 31:07.551
This is judging day,
and, girl,

31:07.620 --> 31:09.241
I was going through it
last night.

31:09.310 --> 31:12.034
I had to make my garment
last minute

31:12.103 --> 31:14.034
because the thing
that I was working on

31:14.103 --> 31:16.655
did not come out
the way I wanted to,

31:16.724 --> 31:19.655
and I just hope
the judges like it.

31:21.551 --> 31:23.379
Gonna walk out there today

31:23.448 --> 31:25.310
with the fattest lips
you've ever seen.

31:25.379 --> 31:26.896
-You better give it.

31:26.965 --> 31:28.241
Just, like, touching
the end of your nose.

31:29.896 --> 31:31.241
When Ru tells you to do
something with your makeup,

31:31.310 --> 31:32.206
you do it.

31:32.275 --> 31:33.448
You don't ask questions.

31:33.517 --> 31:36.172
You just give her the lip
that she wants.

31:36.241 --> 31:37.551
I can't smell right now

31:37.620 --> 31:38.965
because my lips are just
in the way of my nostrils.

31:40.724 --> 31:43.241
I'm gonna think big lips,

31:43.310 --> 31:46.137
and then I will have big lips.

31:48.448 --> 31:52.758
Who do y'all think
is struggling?

31:52.827 --> 31:58.551
I haven't seen a lot
of Willow's garment.

32:00.448 --> 32:01.862
I have not seen much at all.

32:01.931 --> 32:03.586
And what I have seen,
it looks very minimalist.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.724
I don't know if she has,
like, a direction

32:05.793 --> 32:07.931
or, you know, for it
or I don't know.

32:08.000 --> 32:10.379
Just because she's, like,

32:10.448 --> 32:12.206
didn't really spend
a lot of time on it, DeJa.

32:12.275 --> 32:14.827
It kind of just
looks like a bunch of sheets.

32:14.896 --> 32:17.689
And they are gonna hold her
to a certain standard

32:17.758 --> 32:19.827
because she is a seamstress.

32:19.896 --> 32:23.586
DeJa, so you decided on
the Greece outfit, then?

32:23.655 --> 32:25.724
Yeah. Greek goddess,
I love mythology,

32:25.793 --> 32:27.655
and I'm gonna do the damn thing.

32:27.724 --> 32:32.206
I find DeJa's look
to be whelming.

32:32.275 --> 32:34.655
If I had her sewing chops,

32:34.724 --> 32:37.206
I would have shown off what
I could do a little bit more.

32:37.275 --> 32:39.172
And because I have
the best body here,

32:39.241 --> 32:40.448
I wanted to definitely
show that off.

32:40.517 --> 32:41.586
-Right, right, right.
-You know.

32:41.655 --> 32:42.655
-It's a fact.
-I'm the thinnest.

32:42.724 --> 32:44.034
DeJa, I do think you have

32:44.103 --> 32:45.379
one of the sickeningest shapes
here, though.

32:45.448 --> 32:46.689
Thank you.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.689
It's sexy.
It's a sexy shape.

32:48.758 --> 32:51.655
So what y'all think
about my shape, then?

32:51.724 --> 32:52.793
Oh, damn.

32:52.862 --> 32:54.310
Nobody even pads
like that no more.

32:54.379 --> 32:56.965
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

32:57.034 --> 32:59.241
-Okay!
-Damn!

32:59.310 --> 33:00.586
Okay, that's how you feel?

33:00.655 --> 33:02.344
She says as she's padded
next to me right now.

33:02.413 --> 33:04.793
Yeah, Jorgeous, show us what
a real padded ass looks like.

33:04.862 --> 33:06.068
-Yeah!
-Any time.

33:06.137 --> 33:07.551
Give us a twirl, baby.

33:09.103 --> 33:10.862
Wow!

33:10.931 --> 33:13.517
Pull over!

33:13.586 --> 33:15.379
You're welcome.

33:15.448 --> 33:16.965
Your booty a little lopsided,
but it's okay.

33:17.034 --> 33:18.344
Oh, no, yes.

33:18.413 --> 33:20.206
We'll see more of it later
when she's lip syncing.

33:20.275 --> 33:23.551
-Oh!
-Ooh!

33:23.620 --> 33:24.724
I'm just fucking with y'all.

33:24.793 --> 33:26.172
Who are you?

33:26.241 --> 33:28.413
Thank you for transferring
that negative energy.

33:33.310 --> 33:35.000
What age were you
when you got kicked out?

33:35.068 --> 33:36.172
I was kicked out at 15.

33:36.241 --> 33:37.689
Oh, my God.

33:37.758 --> 33:40.068
My dad did not like me
growing up.

33:40.137 --> 33:41.655
Like, at all.

33:41.724 --> 33:44.379
He would tell me
to leave the room

33:44.448 --> 33:46.379
if I walked in
and he was around.

33:46.448 --> 33:47.586
Oh, my God.

33:47.655 --> 33:49.344
And he was, like,
"You disgust me."

33:49.413 --> 33:51.655
Like, you being around me
is disgusting,

33:51.724 --> 33:54.896
because I don't like
your, like, feminine energy.

33:54.965 --> 33:57.896
He didn't want to raise,
like, a weak son.

33:57.965 --> 34:01.931
Because he's sports,
military, all those things.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.310
I remember there were
so many times

34:03.379 --> 34:05.034
when I would, like, talk to him,

34:05.103 --> 34:06.931
just trying to have,
like, normal conversation.

34:07.000 --> 34:08.793
He would tell me,
like, you know,

34:08.862 --> 34:10.137
"I can't have
a conversation with you."

34:10.206 --> 34:11.344
"I don't wanna talk to you
at all,

34:11.413 --> 34:14.448
"because your voice
is gross to me.

34:14.517 --> 34:16.068
I don't like it,
it's so feminine."

34:16.137 --> 34:19.931
And this is something that
I became very used to hearing

34:20.000 --> 34:21.551
at a very early age.

34:21.620 --> 34:25.000
I didn't like that
I got talked to that way,

34:25.068 --> 34:26.241
but I also was, like, eew,

34:26.310 --> 34:28.586
I don't really like you
and who you are.

34:28.655 --> 34:30.551
So it just showed me
at a very early age

34:30.620 --> 34:34.724
that I did not really want
to be a part of my own family.

34:34.793 --> 34:36.655
Me and my dad had--
when I came out,

34:36.724 --> 34:38.413
I didn't even actually
get to come out to him.

34:38.482 --> 34:41.241
I was outed
by one of his friends.

34:41.310 --> 34:42.517
Oh, that's always fierce.

34:42.586 --> 34:45.103
Yeah, I had an Instagram
with my drag and stuff,

34:45.172 --> 34:46.241
and my mom knew.

34:46.310 --> 34:47.310
We were just
hiding it from him.

34:47.379 --> 34:48.448
Like, everyone knew.

34:48.517 --> 34:50.137
If I can ask,
what age were you?

34:50.206 --> 34:53.172
I was 15,
and he came in my room,

34:53.241 --> 34:55.793
he's like, "Listen,
I'm okay with you being gay,

34:55.862 --> 34:57.931
but you need to cut
this drag shit out."

34:58.000 --> 35:00.586
Like, "I'm not having
a drag queen as a son."

35:00.655 --> 35:04.068
My dad kind of already
has this preconceived notion

35:04.137 --> 35:05.620
of what gay life is,

35:05.689 --> 35:09.448
and he didn't really want
to hear me out.

35:09.517 --> 35:10.896
It was, like, six months of us,

35:10.965 --> 35:12.758
like, either not talking
or fighting.

35:12.827 --> 35:14.275
Yep, I relate to that.

35:14.344 --> 35:17.965
And it took his girlfriend
to really open up his mind

35:18.034 --> 35:19.448
and realize, like,
you only have one life,

35:19.517 --> 35:21.034
and if you're really
gonna hate him

35:21.103 --> 35:23.724
because he's doing something
he loves, that--

35:23.793 --> 35:25.000
That's kind of monstrous.

35:25.068 --> 35:26.172
Yeah, exactly.

35:26.241 --> 35:28.310
My dad's girlfriend

35:28.379 --> 35:30.793
really made him see,
you know,

35:30.862 --> 35:34.275
that I am not
some creep or freak,

35:34.344 --> 35:37.551
and made him realize
that it's an art form,

35:37.620 --> 35:39.482
and it's something
to be embracing.

35:39.551 --> 35:40.758
Over the last year,

35:40.827 --> 35:42.758
I feel like we've
gotten back to a place

35:42.827 --> 35:45.758
where we were back
to when before I came out.

35:45.827 --> 35:47.758
Where, like, I can call him
and talk to him.

35:47.827 --> 35:49.896
That's honestly beautiful.

35:52.206 --> 35:54.758
Maddy, do your parents
know you do drag?

35:54.827 --> 35:57.655
My dad knows now.
I told him before I came here.

35:57.724 --> 35:59.068
It was just very, like,

35:59.137 --> 36:00.620
"As long as you're happy,
as long as you're safe."

36:00.689 --> 36:02.103
Aw, I love that.

36:02.172 --> 36:04.241
You know, like, "I support you
and, like, what you do."

36:04.310 --> 36:05.793
What about your mom?

36:05.862 --> 36:09.448
I have not seen my mom
since I was, like, 18.

36:09.517 --> 36:10.586
-Really? Wow.
-Yeah.

36:10.655 --> 36:11.827
Her and my dad, they split up

36:11.896 --> 36:14.310
when I was, like, a baby,
like two or so.

36:14.379 --> 36:16.896
And my dad and my grandma,
like, really helped raise me.

36:16.965 --> 36:19.862
The last time I saw my mom was
for my high school graduation.

36:19.931 --> 36:24.896
She visited, and after
I graduated, she just left.

36:24.965 --> 36:27.000
My grandma was really
like my mom growing up.

36:27.068 --> 36:28.413
-Yeah.
-Same.

36:28.482 --> 36:30.241
So I've always had, like,
that motherly figure,

36:30.310 --> 36:32.172
and, I don't know,
it's just like my mom,

36:32.241 --> 36:33.689
it's just like it's almost
like she's not my mom.

36:33.758 --> 36:35.517
She's just, like another person,

36:35.586 --> 36:38.103
someone who just, like, pops up
every, like, year or two, and--

36:38.172 --> 36:39.965
-Yeah.
-I don't know, like, I feel like

36:40.034 --> 36:43.206
you can't really, like,
miss what you didn't have.

36:43.275 --> 36:45.586
Growing up with my dad,
we lived in a trailer

36:45.655 --> 36:48.034
right next
to where my grandma lived,

36:48.103 --> 36:49.551
and so I spent
a lot of my time with her

36:49.620 --> 36:52.551
She has no idea that I do drag,

36:52.620 --> 36:53.827
and I honestly
100% don't know

36:53.896 --> 36:55.310
what my grandma's gonna think.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.448
I love you, Grandma!

36:58.793 --> 37:00.137
I remember when I came out
to my dad,

37:00.206 --> 37:01.758
I literally told him--like,
I jumped out of the car,

37:01.827 --> 37:02.965
and he was dropping me off
at boarding school.

37:03.034 --> 37:05.241
So I was like, "I'm gay."

37:05.310 --> 37:06.517
Oh, my God.

37:06.586 --> 37:08.103
You told him you were gay

37:08.172 --> 37:10.241
as they were dropping you off
for ballet boarding school?

37:11.517 --> 37:13.103
Wow.

37:13.172 --> 37:14.931
I was like, "I know this
is gonna come as a huge shock.

37:15.000 --> 37:16.413
I'm gay."

37:42.689 --> 37:45.448
-And what?
-Yeah!

37:45.517 --> 37:47.793
Welcome to the main stage
of RuPaul's Drag Race.

37:47.862 --> 37:51.862
She never met a package she
didn't like. Michelle Visage.

37:51.931 --> 37:55.275
Signed, sealed, delivered,
I'm a whore.

37:57.793 --> 38:00.620
And style superstar
Carson Kressley.

38:00.689 --> 38:02.413
Now, do you like to shop online?

38:02.482 --> 38:05.344
Mm, if by "shopping" you mean
"woofing and swiping right,"

38:05.413 --> 38:08.586
then, yes, all the time.

38:08.655 --> 38:12.793
And the amazing
Taraji P. Henson is here.

38:12.862 --> 38:13.931
Welcome!

38:14.000 --> 38:15.034
Thank you, mama.

38:15.103 --> 38:16.793
Now, Taraji, I gotta ask.

38:16.862 --> 38:18.965
What does the "P" stand for?

38:19.034 --> 38:20.482
"Pay them bitches no mind."

38:22.724 --> 38:24.448
Unless they payin' my bills.

38:24.517 --> 38:25.724
-Yes!
-I thought so.

38:25.793 --> 38:28.862
-I thought so.

38:28.931 --> 38:30.275
This week
we challenged our queens

38:30.344 --> 38:34.931
to deliver their Glamazon Prime
creations on the runway.

38:35.000 --> 38:37.103
Racers, start your engines,

38:37.172 --> 38:39.586
and may the best drag queen win.

38:39.655 --> 38:40.586
Coming up...

38:40.655 --> 38:43.068
You are a vision tonight.

38:43.137 --> 38:46.655
It's costumey
in the best possible way.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.689
Well, I disagree.
I hated it.

38:59.965 --> 39:03.862
Category is
Glamazon Primetime.

39:03.931 --> 39:07.310
Up first, Lady Camden.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.793
Now with wings.

39:08.862 --> 39:10.551
Carson:
For heavy flow days.

39:10.620 --> 39:12.103
Yes!

39:12.172 --> 39:14.517
I am giving you
a Glamazon Prime

39:14.586 --> 39:18.482
sexy little fairy that
you just wanna take home.

39:18.551 --> 39:20.344
The wings are definitely
my favorite part.

39:20.413 --> 39:23.000
I covered rods that you use
to construct a tent

39:23.068 --> 39:25.172
with beautiful, flowing net.

39:25.241 --> 39:27.310
Touch all of this net,
darling.

39:27.379 --> 39:29.758
I've cut up the kiddie pool
into lots of stripes

39:29.827 --> 39:31.379
and structured them in a way

39:31.448 --> 39:33.551
that gives me a little bit
of a waist in the middle.

39:33.620 --> 39:35.241
I feel so gorgeous.

39:35.310 --> 39:37.206
Taraji:
Honey, she had me at halo.

39:38.827 --> 39:40.689
Jasmine Kennedie.

39:40.758 --> 39:42.000
-You've heard of Cher?
-Yeah?

39:42.068 --> 39:43.896
This is Scheer.

39:45.827 --> 39:48.689
Taraji:
Oh, she is a breast in show.

39:48.758 --> 39:53.206
I'm feeling full
Romana downtown-a, yes.

39:53.275 --> 39:57.758
My look is made out of bed
canopies, fringed tapestries.

39:57.827 --> 39:59.241
I used some cookie cutters,

39:59.310 --> 40:03.551
and a hat that
I covered with yarn.

40:03.620 --> 40:05.586
I feel like Samantha
inSex and the City,

40:05.655 --> 40:08.241
and I'm about to go get plowed
on my red Jeep.

40:09.793 --> 40:14.965
RuPaul :
Does anybody still wear a hat?

40:15.034 --> 40:16.344
Michelle:
I'll drink to that.

40:17.655 --> 40:18.931
Daya Betty.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.620
Michelle:
Does anyone have eyes on Daya?

40:23.206 --> 40:24.586
I am bringing
my little puppet.

40:24.655 --> 40:26.000
Her name is Daya Rhea.

40:26.068 --> 40:28.793
She is the inspiration
behind this garment,

40:28.862 --> 40:31.758
which is made out of
a kid's bed canopy,

40:31.827 --> 40:33.448
a reflective tablecloth,

40:33.517 --> 40:35.827
and a couple bed skirts
for the base.

40:35.896 --> 40:38.724
I am feeling
my oatmeal cookies,

40:38.793 --> 40:40.896
and I'm living
my Muppets fantasy.

40:40.965 --> 40:42.172
Taraji:
Talk to the hand, henny.

40:43.793 --> 40:45.931
So what do you think the judges
are thinking right now?

40:46.000 --> 40:47.793
"She's a top."

40:49.827 --> 40:51.413
Maddy Morphosis.

40:51.482 --> 40:52.517
Carson:
Hoop, there it is.

40:54.517 --> 40:57.517
RuPaul:
Is that Dean Martin with her?

40:57.586 --> 40:59.103
I'm strutting
down the runway,

40:59.172 --> 41:00.931
arm-in-arm with
that little blow-up doll.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.931
We just made our entrance
into the square dance.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.310
I'm wearing this beautiful gown
made out of aprons,

41:05.379 --> 41:07.379
with little scrunchy
accoutrements,

41:07.448 --> 41:11.551
and he is, of course, wearing
his matching apron shirt.

41:11.620 --> 41:13.689
The inspiration
behind this makeup look

41:13.758 --> 41:16.413
is borderline rodeo clown,
but in a classy way.

41:16.482 --> 41:17.862
I'm sure the judges
are looking at me

41:17.931 --> 41:20.172
like what the fuck
is going on right now?

41:20.241 --> 41:21.758
Michelle:
Her DMs are blowing up.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.379
Mm-hmm.

41:26.482 --> 41:28.172
Yeah, that's a grower,
that one.

41:28.241 --> 41:29.655
Willow Pill.

41:29.724 --> 41:33.241
Now, this is a fisting
accident gone wrong.

41:33.310 --> 41:34.620
I wanted
to make an outfit

41:34.689 --> 41:36.241
that makes me look like
a kids' nightmare,

41:36.310 --> 41:37.620
but in a friendly way.

41:37.689 --> 41:40.517
I've got these long,
scary Muppet arms

41:40.586 --> 41:43.620
with these fuzzy little fingers
that claw at you.

41:43.689 --> 41:46.517
This slutty little dress
that's lined with pink yarn.

41:46.586 --> 41:48.344
I've got these
little polka-dot horns,

41:48.413 --> 41:51.724
just to give all of that
monster under the bed drama.

41:51.793 --> 41:55.103
This runway for me
is a sigh of relief

41:55.172 --> 41:56.551
that I didn't walk down

41:56.620 --> 41:58.689
in some scraps that
I hot glued together.

41:58.758 --> 42:00.068
You know what they
say about Willow?

42:00.137 --> 42:02.413
-What?
-Keep her at an arm's length.

42:04.137 --> 42:05.620
Bosco.

42:05.689 --> 42:08.379
That collar should
keep her from licking herself.

42:10.068 --> 42:12.965
The vibe is Billy Idol

42:13.034 --> 42:16.724
as an anime super-villain
wearing culottes.

42:16.793 --> 42:21.206
I've used plastic balls,
parking cones, camping stakes,

42:21.275 --> 42:23.827
and I sewed the pants
out of a painting tarp.

42:23.896 --> 42:26.551
I'm also completely
hot glued into this outfit,

42:26.620 --> 42:27.862
so I'm really hoping

42:27.931 --> 42:29.517
that I don't have to pee
any time soon.

42:29.586 --> 42:32.103
She's raising
the stakes, henny.

42:32.172 --> 42:33.344
Tent stakes.

42:34.965 --> 42:36.551
DeJa Skye.

42:36.620 --> 42:38.413
"Greece" is the word.

42:38.482 --> 42:39.965
It is.

42:40.034 --> 42:43.689
I am giving full
Aphrodite Grecian god realness,

42:43.758 --> 42:45.620
and I'm giving
that full homage,

42:45.689 --> 42:48.551
with that two-toned,
organic, drapey garment

42:48.620 --> 42:51.344
made out of bedsheets
and a tablecloth.

42:51.413 --> 42:53.517
I've used gold doilies
as accents.

42:53.586 --> 42:57.827
I am feeling like a Greek god
floating on air. Oh!

42:57.896 --> 42:59.620
Michelle:
Well, hello, Doily!

43:01.862 --> 43:04.965
Her Mount Olym-pussy
is on fire.

43:05.034 --> 43:07.275
Oh, my God.

43:07.344 --> 43:08.965
Angeria.

43:09.034 --> 43:11.482
Taraji:
Oh, she's huge on OnlyFans.

43:13.586 --> 43:15.206
I have taken
the little black dress

43:15.275 --> 43:18.172
and I have elevated her, honey,
to the 10th power,

43:18.241 --> 43:25.034
complete with a peplum and
these big, gorgeous shoulders.

43:25.103 --> 43:27.724
Who knew that you could take
curtains and blinds

43:27.793 --> 43:32.275
and make a beautiful
cocktail eleganza?

43:32.344 --> 43:34.413
I feel like I am at
the Daytime Emmys, honey.

43:34.482 --> 43:37.068
Tell that cameraman to come
over here and take my picture,

43:37.137 --> 43:38.896
'cause I look stunning.

43:38.965 --> 43:42.310
Yes, honey,
feel the fantasy.

43:42.379 --> 43:43.448
Jorgeous.

43:43.517 --> 43:45.310
It's Shaqueera.

43:47.206 --> 43:50.103
I'm feeling my
fucking Shakira oats right now.

43:50.172 --> 43:51.827
Like, this is what
Shakira would wear

43:51.896 --> 43:53.689
if she had the JLo dress.

43:53.758 --> 43:56.000
I'm wearing the curtain
for the dress,

43:56.068 --> 43:58.551
and then I used a pillowcase
for the bra,

43:58.620 --> 44:00.379
cookie cutters on my boob,

44:00.448 --> 44:04.896
and I also used a piece
of a pool for my panties.

44:04.965 --> 44:08.172
-Okay.
-Yes.

44:08.241 --> 44:10.344
I'm just not gonna give you
just a regular runway walk.

44:10.413 --> 44:11.689
I'm giving you choreo.

44:11.758 --> 44:12.896
She got steps.

44:12.965 --> 44:15.827
She is shooting
for the stars, honey.

44:15.896 --> 44:17.103
Kerri Colby.

44:17.172 --> 44:20.344
She's mopping the runway
with this lewk.

44:20.413 --> 44:24.344
This is just giving me
my trantasy fantasy.

44:24.413 --> 44:25.827
We know I live for that.

44:25.896 --> 44:28.758
My boobs is out,
my ass is out,

44:28.827 --> 44:32.206
my fin is out
because I made one,

44:32.275 --> 44:34.827
and I'm glittering
from head to toe.

44:34.896 --> 44:38.655
I am just giving you
that Tyra Banks fierceness.

44:38.724 --> 44:40.827
Taraji:
I like her fringe benefits.

44:42.965 --> 44:44.275
Coming up...

44:44.344 --> 44:46.517
Classy, baby.
You wowed me.

44:46.586 --> 44:49.586
This look needs to breathe.

44:49.655 --> 44:50.862
It's just kind of hard
to look at.

44:57.137 --> 45:00.827
Welcome, ladies.
I've made some decisions.

45:02.068 --> 45:04.241
When I call your name,
please step forward.

45:07.206 --> 45:09.310
Daya Betty.

45:09.379 --> 45:10.344
Willow Pill.

45:11.758 --> 45:13.413
Bosco.

45:13.482 --> 45:16.206
Kerri Colby.

45:17.482 --> 45:18.896
Ladies, you are safe.

45:21.413 --> 45:22.965
I'm safe. Again.

45:23.034 --> 45:25.965
Definitely thought I would
at least be in the top.

45:27.517 --> 45:29.551
You may leave the stage.

45:33.241 --> 45:38.758
Ladies, you represent the tops
and bottoms of the week.

45:38.827 --> 45:40.413
Now it's time
for the judges' critiques.

45:40.482 --> 45:45.310
Up first, Lady Camden.

45:45.379 --> 45:47.137
You are a vision tonight.

45:47.206 --> 45:50.758
I love the way
you proportioned it.

45:50.827 --> 45:52.724
I love the outline, the way
you cut everything up

45:52.793 --> 45:54.206
to give it movement
when you walk.

45:54.275 --> 45:56.068
What did you use?
I'm intrigued.

45:56.137 --> 45:58.689
Well, I used
an inflatable kiddie pool

45:58.758 --> 46:00.137
for the strips of fabric.

46:00.206 --> 46:01.862
-Hey, kiddie pool!

46:01.931 --> 46:03.172
Wow, all right, kiddie pool!

46:03.241 --> 46:05.793
Carson, I suggested
she make a bigger lip,

46:05.862 --> 46:07.827
-and she did it.
-Mm-hmm!

46:07.896 --> 46:10.931
Puts the proportions of your
face in the right places.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.551
She made a bigger lip
and a big impression.

46:13.620 --> 46:15.896
-Hey-lo.
-Hello!

46:15.965 --> 46:17.758
This is--it's just gorgeous.

46:17.827 --> 46:20.827
It's costumey
in the best possible way.

46:20.896 --> 46:23.793
-I think you killed it.
-Thank you.

46:23.862 --> 46:26.896
Straight from the Kennedie
compound, it's Jasmine.

46:26.965 --> 46:28.310
-Hats off to you.
-Tch.

46:28.379 --> 46:30.482
I mean, no, take it off.

46:32.275 --> 46:34.241
There's a lot
of great ideas here.

46:34.310 --> 46:36.000
I think this look
needs to breathe,

46:36.068 --> 46:38.068
and I think the hat could go.

46:38.137 --> 46:41.724
I think the dream catcher
earrings could go.

46:41.793 --> 46:43.482
I love a halter neck,
but again,

46:43.551 --> 46:45.137
I think the earrings
take away from it.

46:45.206 --> 46:46.517
They're too big and bulky,

46:46.586 --> 46:48.482
so they get in the way,
and they jumble together.

46:48.551 --> 46:50.896
It's just messy.

46:50.965 --> 46:52.862
I totally understand
what you're saying.

46:52.931 --> 46:54.275
Like, as Coco Chanel says,

46:54.344 --> 46:56.034
take two things off
before you leave the house.

46:56.103 --> 46:57.862
Just make sure them two things
ain't them titties.

46:57.931 --> 47:00.310
No, ma'am. I'm keeping
these on forever.

47:00.379 --> 47:02.034
I want my titties
to look like that.

47:02.103 --> 47:03.724
Can I have those?

47:03.793 --> 47:06.034
Hell, yes!

47:06.103 --> 47:11.137
Up next, Maddy and Daddy
Morphosis.

47:12.689 --> 47:14.482
I have daddy issues.

47:14.551 --> 47:16.172
I know you're going for comedy,

47:16.241 --> 47:19.172
but I don't understand
the outfit.

47:19.241 --> 47:21.896
What is the story here?

47:21.965 --> 47:24.068
As I was making it,
it was starting to give, like,

47:24.137 --> 47:26.793
a ragtag, homemade,
country outfit.

47:26.862 --> 47:29.000
And so I really leaned into it,

47:29.068 --> 47:31.413
like a girl who just, like,
put together scraps

47:31.482 --> 47:33.275
and made her dress
to go out square dancing.

47:33.344 --> 47:38.689
Yeah, I didn't get it from
the presentation, unfortunately.

47:38.758 --> 47:40.965
You have to be careful
when you use props in drag.

47:41.034 --> 47:43.379
I mean, we love that,
but I don't know,

47:43.448 --> 47:45.068
it felt like you were trying

47:45.137 --> 47:49.137
to distract away from
the outfit a little bit.

47:49.206 --> 47:51.793
That weird length,
not quite to the ground,

47:51.862 --> 47:54.689
never really works on anybody.

47:54.758 --> 47:56.275
The slant of the skirt,

47:56.344 --> 47:59.000
the edges kind of
being unfinished,

47:59.068 --> 48:01.586
it's just kind of hard
to look at.

48:01.655 --> 48:03.034
I loved your idea
of being funny.

48:03.103 --> 48:05.172
Fashion needs that, you know?

48:05.241 --> 48:07.275
I just wish you had paid
a little more attention

48:07.344 --> 48:08.448
to just those details.

48:09.620 --> 48:11.413
And put a gold chain on Papi.

48:14.241 --> 48:16.137
Up next, DeJa Skye.

48:16.206 --> 48:17.310
And then there's mauve.

48:17.379 --> 48:19.275
Okay!

48:19.344 --> 48:21.793
This color story
of all these mauves and pinks,

48:21.862 --> 48:23.103
that all really works.

48:23.172 --> 48:25.586
It makes you look
and feel gorgeous.

48:25.655 --> 48:26.931
And they're tablecloths?

48:27.000 --> 48:28.275
Yeah, they're tablecloths,

48:28.344 --> 48:30.448
and then the back
is like a sheet, I think.

48:30.517 --> 48:31.724
It's so sheet!

48:33.448 --> 48:36.103
But the headpiece and the fan
look so cheap

48:36.172 --> 48:38.758
that it really does
take away from the whole look.

48:38.827 --> 48:42.827
Sometimes we just have
to look--you know, pull out--

48:42.896 --> 48:45.172
how many times
have I heard that?

48:46.931 --> 48:48.068
Pull out of the situation

48:48.137 --> 48:49.689
and look down,
you know, at yourself,

48:49.758 --> 48:52.965
and say, "Does this add
or does this subtract?"

48:53.034 --> 48:54.758
And I think those two things

48:54.827 --> 48:57.896
brought me out
of this beautiful look.

48:57.965 --> 48:59.517
Okay.

48:59.586 --> 49:04.241
Up next, Angeria Paris
VanMicheals.

49:04.310 --> 49:08.172
Honey, I just hear you saying,
"The champagne is burned."

49:10.103 --> 49:11.931
Classy, baby. You wowed me.

49:12.000 --> 49:14.137
I think I put on the card,
"Wow."

49:14.206 --> 49:16.620
And what did you use again?

49:16.689 --> 49:20.862
These are black curtains
and some fancy blinds.

49:20.931 --> 49:22.689
-Blinds!
-Yeah.

49:22.758 --> 49:24.931
Fashionable window dressing.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.068
It is classic,
bougie, snatch it.

49:28.137 --> 49:29.655
Yeah.

49:29.724 --> 49:31.000
It is gorgeous.

49:31.068 --> 49:34.241
It looks like
the most beautiful taffeta.

49:34.310 --> 49:37.000
I didn't know exactly
what I was going for

49:37.068 --> 49:37.965
when I was talking to you.

49:38.034 --> 49:39.551
I just knew that I had these,

49:39.620 --> 49:43.000
and they were gonna lead me to
where I was going, and they did.

49:43.068 --> 49:46.068
Well, the congregation will
never be the same after this.

49:47.758 --> 49:49.137
And what will the preacher say?

49:52.310 --> 49:54.655
That look said, "Oh, I got
the tea on the preacher."

49:54.724 --> 49:56.965
Mm-hmm.

49:58.034 --> 50:00.000
Up next, Jorgeous.

50:00.068 --> 50:02.137
Hello there. Hi.

50:02.206 --> 50:04.275
You know, I was worried
in the werkroom,

50:04.344 --> 50:07.655
because you had kind of like
an aubergine blanket

50:07.724 --> 50:09.068
that was made out of fleece.

50:09.137 --> 50:11.275
I was so thrilled when
you came around the corner

50:11.344 --> 50:13.448
and you weren't wearing that.

50:13.517 --> 50:16.551
And this, it's edited
and it's elevated.

50:17.620 --> 50:19.448
Well, I disagree.
I hated it.

50:20.724 --> 50:22.586
And I hated
that it's not on me.

50:25.034 --> 50:27.413
-Baby, you turned it.
-Thank you so much.

50:27.482 --> 50:30.172
I could see Beyoncé
in that right now.

50:30.241 --> 50:35.206
It is simple, but sometimes
simple is smart.

50:35.275 --> 50:36.482
Okay?

50:36.551 --> 50:38.724
You know, last week
you were in the bottom,

50:38.793 --> 50:42.000
and you have redeemed yourself
this week, child.

50:42.068 --> 50:45.689
Thankfully for Angeria,
she had this extra fabric,

50:45.758 --> 50:47.344
and she legit
saved my life, like--

50:47.413 --> 50:49.344
I always ask you.

50:49.413 --> 50:51.448
I don't know who taught you
how to put yourself together,

50:51.517 --> 50:55.931
but they deserve a percentage
of your earnings.

50:56.000 --> 50:57.620
I kind of wanna see you perform
in that, but--

50:59.413 --> 51:01.310
I was ready to do so,
trust and believe.

51:05.137 --> 51:07.000
Thank you, ladies,
I think we've heard enough.

51:07.068 --> 51:09.620
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

51:09.689 --> 51:11.724
the judges and I
will deliberate.

51:13.103 --> 51:15.137
All right, now, just
between us squirrel friends,

51:15.206 --> 51:17.724
I wanna know what you all think,

51:17.793 --> 51:20.103
starting with Lady Camden.

51:20.172 --> 51:21.103
Very Bob Mackie.

51:21.172 --> 51:24.068
Who thinks to cut up a pool?

51:24.137 --> 51:27.551
And, you know, the way she
tapered and layered the skirt

51:27.620 --> 51:30.862
these different lengths, for a
dancer, that's the golden rule.

51:30.931 --> 51:32.655
Progressively,
she's been getting

51:32.724 --> 51:34.413
stronger and stronger
and stronger,

51:34.482 --> 51:36.931
and tonight
is no exception to that.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.137
Jasmine Kennedie.

51:38.206 --> 51:41.896
You could tell how much
she loves drag.

51:41.965 --> 51:45.344
The outfit, I think, was
three-quarters of the way there.

51:45.413 --> 51:48.172
She used a bed canopy,
yarn, cookie cutters,

51:48.241 --> 51:51.655
fringe tapestry, beach hat,
clam rasp, blender,

51:51.724 --> 51:54.000
car battery, jumper cables,
garden hose.

51:54.068 --> 51:55.379
Part of the challenge is, like,

51:55.448 --> 51:58.000
make smart choices about
what you're going to use,

51:58.068 --> 52:00.896
and then create an elevated,
chic look with them,

52:00.965 --> 52:01.965
and it was just too much.

52:02.034 --> 52:03.586
Sometimes it takes a while

52:03.655 --> 52:06.482
for a person to understand
their own personal style,

52:06.551 --> 52:07.517
what works on them.

52:07.586 --> 52:08.862
And you know, at 22,

52:08.931 --> 52:10.517
she hasn't
quite learned that yet.

52:10.586 --> 52:12.758
-She'll get it.
-She'll get it.

52:12.827 --> 52:14.206
She's 22.

52:14.275 --> 52:17.965
Maddy Morphosis
and Daddy Morphosis.

52:18.034 --> 52:20.000
Daddy's gonna put Maddy up
for adoption.

52:21.655 --> 52:23.655
I can say that,
because I'm an adopted kid.

52:23.724 --> 52:25.931
You can say that.
You have that right.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.448
This was a fashion challenge,

52:27.517 --> 52:30.931
and she was definitely
fashion challenged.

52:31.000 --> 52:32.758
That skirt was bad.

52:32.827 --> 52:34.655
It was constructed poorly.

52:34.724 --> 52:38.448
The problem here is the outfit
started taking shape

52:38.517 --> 52:41.034
before she had an idea
of what it was.

52:41.103 --> 52:43.379
Give us funny, give us campy,
that's no problem.

52:43.448 --> 52:45.793
But it's still gotta have
some craftsmanship.

52:45.862 --> 52:48.103
We still have to be
entertained.

52:48.172 --> 52:49.758
DeJa Skye.

52:49.827 --> 52:51.758
I thought the look she created
had such great movement.

52:51.827 --> 52:53.344
There was, like,
a scene in Xanadu

52:53.413 --> 52:56.137
where they're all roller skating
as, like, Grecian goddesses,

52:56.206 --> 52:57.448
and it moved like that.

52:57.517 --> 52:59.137
I know it well.

52:59.206 --> 53:03.206
Then the doily, like, fan
and headpiece was a Xana-don't.

53:03.275 --> 53:05.827
Yes! It was gorgeous.

53:05.896 --> 53:07.793
And then those two things
were so distracting,

53:07.862 --> 53:09.758
it was, like, eew.

53:11.551 --> 53:12.965
Angeria.

53:13.034 --> 53:14.586
When she came out on the stage,
I was, like...

53:14.655 --> 53:18.827
Because literally, I could see
that on a red carpet.

53:18.896 --> 53:19.793
I saw those fans
and I thought, ooh,

53:19.862 --> 53:21.172
those are gonna be a problem.

53:21.241 --> 53:24.620
But the way she placed them,
just breathtaking.

53:24.689 --> 53:26.620
And I love that
she slicked her hair back

53:26.689 --> 53:28.137
to make it a little bit
more modern.

53:28.206 --> 53:30.344
Because it could look a little,
like, eighties of an era,

53:30.413 --> 53:32.241
and not brought to now.

53:32.310 --> 53:34.586
I keep waiting
for this bitch to fall,

53:34.655 --> 53:36.310
and she's just not falling.

53:36.379 --> 53:37.551
Jorgeous.

53:37.620 --> 53:38.931
There's this thing
that I like to say.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.241
It's called "hair acting."

53:40.310 --> 53:42.241
-Uh-huh.
-She has it down, honey.

53:42.310 --> 53:46.413
I just love to see a woman
work that hair, you know.

53:46.482 --> 53:48.931
That's where
you can't overdo it.

53:49.000 --> 53:51.137
Very entertaining.

53:51.206 --> 53:54.482
The look was a Zaldy creation
for, like, a Katy Perry tour.

53:54.551 --> 53:57.068
It was edited, it was
flattering on the body.

53:57.137 --> 53:58.724
I keep drilling her,
"Who taught you that?"

53:58.793 --> 54:00.172
You know who taught her?

54:00.241 --> 54:01.586
-Who?
-You did!

54:01.655 --> 54:03.482
-Well, you know--
-She grew up watching you.

54:03.551 --> 54:05.206
She learned it
from watching you, dad.

54:05.275 --> 54:07.689
She learned it
from watching you.

54:07.758 --> 54:09.758
Yes.

54:09.827 --> 54:11.103
Silence.

54:11.172 --> 54:13.034
I've made my decision.

54:13.103 --> 54:14.689
Bring back my girls.

54:20.137 --> 54:22.655
Welcome back, ladies.

54:22.724 --> 54:24.517
I've made some decisions.

54:28.379 --> 54:29.689
Angeria.

54:29.758 --> 54:33.344
Tonight you made
big fans out of all of us.

54:35.241 --> 54:36.172
You're safe.

54:36.241 --> 54:37.655
Thank you.

54:40.689 --> 54:42.413
Lady Camden.

54:42.482 --> 54:47.620
Your kiddie pool couture
made quite a splash.

54:49.448 --> 54:50.620
You are safe.

54:54.827 --> 54:56.379
Jorgeous.

54:56.448 --> 54:59.103
You are one smart cookie.

55:00.758 --> 55:03.172
Con-drag-ulations. You are the
winner of this week's challenge.

55:03.241 --> 55:05.655
Oh, my God.

55:05.724 --> 55:09.931
You've won a cash prize
of $5,000,

55:10.000 --> 55:12.137
courtesy of Sunday Riley.

55:12.206 --> 55:14.827
Yes, I finally won a challenge.

55:14.896 --> 55:17.379
Oh, my God!
Thank you all.

55:17.448 --> 55:19.586
I'm on top of the world
right now.

55:19.655 --> 55:21.689
Oh, my God.

55:21.758 --> 55:23.551
I definitely don't think
it's top material.

55:23.620 --> 55:24.931
What are you conveying,

55:25.000 --> 55:28.896
other than, hey,
I'm Gorgeous Jorgeous?

55:31.551 --> 55:33.275
Maddy Morphosis.

55:33.344 --> 55:37.344
Tonight
your country wasn't cool.

55:38.965 --> 55:40.379
Jasmine Kennedie.

55:40.448 --> 55:41.689
You did your breast,

55:41.758 --> 55:45.551
but your accessories
were a bit of a bust.

55:47.034 --> 55:48.241
DeJa Skye.

55:49.551 --> 55:53.689
Your goddess look
was not mighty, Aphrodite.

55:59.689 --> 56:01.931
DeJa Skye,

56:02.000 --> 56:03.000
you are safe.

56:06.068 --> 56:08.068
You may join the other girls.

56:09.758 --> 56:13.482
Maddy, Jasmine,
I'm sorry, my dears,

56:13.551 --> 56:16.000
but you're up for elimination.

56:17.344 --> 56:19.448
I'm so pissed at myself

56:19.517 --> 56:20.965
that I'm in
this position again.

56:21.034 --> 56:23.000
But I am not going home
to Jasmine,

56:23.068 --> 56:26.620
especially not after what
happened in the Untucked.

56:26.689 --> 56:28.068
You were in the bottom as well!

56:28.137 --> 56:30.896
I hope you give the second-best
lip sync of the night.

56:30.965 --> 56:32.758
I'm going to destroy you
in this lip sync.

56:32.827 --> 56:33.862
Set your fucking cocktail down,

56:33.931 --> 56:36.965
because I am not worried,
period.

56:37.034 --> 56:39.965
I'm gonna sell
the fuck outta this song.

56:40.034 --> 56:41.931
Two queens stand before me.

56:43.448 --> 56:48.172
Ladies, this is your last chance
to impress me

56:48.241 --> 56:53.206
and save yourself
from elimination.

56:55.620 --> 56:57.586
The time has come...

56:57.655 --> 56:59.758
for you to lip sync...

56:59.827 --> 57:04.275
for your life!

57:07.034 --> 57:09.655
I do feel my body, like,
shaking a little bit more

57:09.724 --> 57:12.275
in the sense that, like,
I want the song to start

57:12.344 --> 57:16.862
so I can stomp on this floor
and make Maddy eat it.

57:16.931 --> 57:23.137
Good luck,
and don't fuck it up.

57:23.206 --> 57:27.724
Damn, that was so good,
I wanna buy him a short set.

57:30.413 --> 57:32.586
Oh, yeah.

59:28.758 --> 59:32.000
Ladies, I've made my decision.

59:40.379 --> 59:43.034
Jasmine Kennedie,
shantay you stay.

59:46.448 --> 59:47.931
Thank you.

59:48.000 --> 59:49.793
You may join the other girls.

59:53.000 --> 1:00:00.068
Maddy, your fate now rests
in the hands of the drag gods.

1:00:01.482 --> 1:00:05.310
If you have the gold bar,
you will be saved.

1:00:06.862 --> 1:00:08.827
You've been hiding your candy.

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:10.000
Now...

1:00:12.482 --> 1:00:13.862
Let's see what you've got.

1:00:26.931 --> 1:00:28.689
It's chocolate.

1:00:30.241 --> 1:00:34.655
Maddy Morphosis,
because we knew you,

1:00:34.724 --> 1:00:37.344
we have been changed for good.

1:00:37.413 --> 1:00:41.586
Now sashay away.

1:00:41.655 --> 1:00:43.068
Thank you.

1:00:47.655 --> 1:00:49.068
Love you, Maddy.

1:00:49.137 --> 1:00:53.206
I just want you to remember me
by two simple words.

1:00:53.275 --> 1:00:55.034
It doesn't matter which two,
as long as they're simple.

1:00:58.206 --> 1:00:59.172
Thank you.

1:01:01.275 --> 1:01:03.482
I feel like I went home
way too early.

1:01:03.551 --> 1:01:06.793
Daddy Morphosis
did not have my back,

1:01:06.862 --> 1:01:09.379
and he really sacrificed me to
the wolves in this competition.

1:01:09.448 --> 1:01:11.241
I grew up in a small town
in Arkansas,

1:01:11.310 --> 1:01:13.241
and the fact that
I even made it here

1:01:13.310 --> 1:01:16.310
is, like, so much more
than I ever dreamed possible.

1:01:16.379 --> 1:01:20.620
Don't be afraid to live your
life as you want to live it.

1:01:24.689 --> 1:01:27.793
Con-drag-ulations, ladies.

1:01:27.862 --> 1:01:29.862
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

1:01:29.931 --> 1:01:32.689
how in the hell
you gonna love somebody else?

1:01:32.758 --> 1:01:33.827
Can I get an "amen" in here?

1:01:33.896 --> 1:01:35.689
-Amen!
-Amen!

1:01:35.758 --> 1:01:38.206
All right.
Now let the music play.

1:01:51.965 --> 1:01:53.206
Next time
onRuPaul's Drag Race...

1:01:53.275 --> 1:01:56.172
You'll be starring
in The Daytona Wind.

1:01:56.241 --> 1:01:58.517
Nobody can stop this bitch.

1:01:58.586 --> 1:02:01.413
My king!

1:02:01.482 --> 1:02:02.896
More drama!

1:02:02.965 --> 1:02:05.689
Where is my car?

1:02:05.758 --> 1:02:06.862
Did I leave the oven on?

1:02:09.103 --> 1:02:10.689
Give us another Emmy, please.

1:02:10.758 --> 1:02:13.275
You came in and nailed it.

1:02:13.344 --> 1:02:15.896
Those lips screamed
"prostitute."

1:02:17.344 --> 1:02:19.172
I definitely think
you could have gone further.

1:02:20.517 --> 1:02:23.275
I am not happy to be safe.

1:02:23.344 --> 1:02:25.931
Sorry to the girls that
glued stuff on their bodysuit.

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:30.103
Jorgeous, it was just fabric.

1:02:30.172 --> 1:02:32.862
Girl, step it up
and stop being a sourpuss.
