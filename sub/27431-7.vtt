WEBVTT

00:01.085 --> 00:02.128
Previously on Gotham...

00:02.212 --> 00:03.671
You're the brother I never had.

00:03.838 --> 00:05.882
We will create a legacy
in this city.

00:06.049 --> 00:07.300
<i>Gotham falls,</i>

00:07.675 --> 00:08.635
<i>we rise.</i>

00:09.135 --> 00:10.011
Together.

00:10.386 --> 00:11.471
BARBARA:
Poor Jim.

00:11.638 --> 00:12.555
All alone again.

00:12.722 --> 00:14.766
- I told you to leave.
- I heard you.

00:15.433 --> 00:17.018
<i>GORDON: So many things
I wish I could change.</i>

00:17.268 --> 00:18.311
Things I've done.

00:18.478 --> 00:20.313
We're here now.
We'll try to put

00:20.480 --> 00:21.856
the pieces back together again.

00:22.065 --> 00:22.732
BARBARA:
<i>Jim,</i>

00:22.899 --> 00:23.775
I'm pregnant.

00:24.984 --> 00:27.403
- This isn't you.
- We're not the same.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.614
<i>That night that your parents
were murdered,</i>

00:29.989 --> 00:32.867
<i>I didn't do anything,
because I didn't care.</i>

00:33.034 --> 00:35.537
Everyone,
let's dig a little deeper.

00:35.787 --> 00:37.956
'Cause that's the only way
you're all making it out

00:38.122 --> 00:39.123
of this hole.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.960
- SELINA: Deep enough?
- (groans)

00:42.168 --> 00:43.461
You're leaving Gotham.

00:43.628 --> 00:45.338
<i>OSWALD: There's nothing left
for me here anymore.</i>

00:45.588 --> 00:46.673
<i>I've done all I can.</i>

00:46.839 --> 00:47.757
I want in.

00:49.133 --> 00:49.842
(grunting)

00:50.009 --> 00:53.179
<i>JEREMIAH:
I love family reunions.</i>

00:53.513 --> 00:54.556
Don't you?

00:59.727 --> 01:02.313
(grunting)

01:02.564 --> 01:03.898
Go. Go, go.

01:04.983 --> 01:06.568
(indistinct shouting)

01:08.194 --> 01:10.154
<i>IS'</i>

01:17.912 --> 01:19.247
- Which way?
- Wait.

01:19.831 --> 01:21.541
<i>IS'</i>

01:25.878 --> 01:27.213
(whizzing)

01:32.760 --> 01:35.471
(coughing)

01:39.183 --> 01:41.477
(choking)

01:44.022 --> 01:45.982
<i>IS'</i>

01:50.903 --> 01:51.863
General,

01:52.155 --> 01:53.865
you were the ones
who let Walker operate

01:54.032 --> 01:55.325
right under your noses.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.702
Now you're telling me
she evaded capture?

01:57.994 --> 01:59.621
WADE:
I understand your frustration.

02:00.079 --> 02:02.290
Have you at least determined
why she did what she did?

02:02.915 --> 02:03.875
Not yet.

02:04.250 --> 02:05.710
Look, bottom line,

02:06.252 --> 02:08.211
Walker and Dorrance
are out of the picture.

02:08.463 --> 02:10.590
What else is standing in the way
of reunification?

02:10.757 --> 02:11.716
WADE:
Nothing.

02:11.841 --> 02:14.302
I'm recommending we begin
the process immediately.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.513
There have been a lot of
promises from across the river.

02:17.722 --> 02:19.807
WADE: But unlike Walker,
or whoever she is,

02:19.974 --> 02:21.726
I have the authority
to take action.

02:21.893 --> 02:24.729
Unless something happens
to destabilize Gotham again,

02:24.896 --> 02:26.731
this nightmare is about to end.

02:27.607 --> 02:28.733
<i>BULLOCK:
Think he's for real?</i>

02:28.900 --> 02:30.276
<i>I'll</i> believe it
when it happens.

02:30.443 --> 02:32.403
I take it your search party
didn't find Alfred.

02:32.612 --> 02:33.821
Neither hide nor hair.

02:34.739 --> 02:36.157
Pennyworth vanished
five days ago.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.283
It ain't looking good.

02:37.659 --> 02:38.618
How's Bruce?

02:39.369 --> 02:41.746
He's been pulling double shifts
on the search parties.

02:42.288 --> 02:43.956
Kid's dead on his feet.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.588
I want to search
this area next.

02:50.755 --> 02:52.006
There are whole blocks
of abandoned buildings.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.800
- I'll get a squad right on it.
- Just give me five minutes.

02:53.966 --> 02:55.259
- I'll be ready.
- No.

02:55.677 --> 02:56.511
You're not going out.

02:56.678 --> 02:58.346
- No, Jim...
- You need your rest.

02:58.513 --> 03:00.181
I'm not cutting you out,
but I need you sharp,

03:00.348 --> 03:01.599
not a liability.

03:06.145 --> 03:08.231
I just don't understand
what could have happened.

03:08.523 --> 03:09.565
Neither do I.

03:10.525 --> 03:11.484
But I know
that Alfred Pennyworth

03:11.651 --> 03:12.985
can take care of himself.

03:14.737 --> 03:16.239
<i>I'll</i> send for you
if I hear anything.

03:24.205 --> 03:24.914
Kid's tough.

03:25.081 --> 03:25.957
Yeah.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.209
In other good-ish news,
Harper radioed.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.460
<i>Her squad
found something.</i>

03:29.919 --> 03:30.628
What?

03:32.463 --> 03:33.506
It's weird.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.967
- (camera shutter clicks)
- (siren whoops)

03:36.134 --> 03:37.093
HARPER:
Four men.

03:38.136 --> 03:39.762
Looks like they breathed in
some sort of chemical agent.

03:39.929 --> 03:41.055
I'm thinking airborne.

03:41.723 --> 03:43.141
And the Z's on their bodies?

03:43.516 --> 03:45.101
Carved into them
before time of death.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.769
Check out the mustache.

03:50.690 --> 03:52.108
- Fake.
- Seems like

03:52.275 --> 03:53.818
they escaped from here.

03:56.779 --> 03:57.864
GORDON:
A film set?

03:58.114 --> 03:59.240
HARPER:
I said it was weird.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.993
BULLOCK:
Zs on their chests.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.162
Think it could be Zsasz?

04:05.496 --> 04:07.123
Chemicals aren't
really his MO.

04:07.290 --> 04:09.751
Plus, I never figured Zsasz
for much of a cinephile.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.420
But whoever it is, if they
have more of these chemicals

04:12.587 --> 04:13.671
and the will
to use them...

04:13.838 --> 04:15.339
it's bye-bye, reunification.

04:16.257 --> 04:19.051
Got to stop him before news
reaches the mainland.

04:21.178 --> 04:22.180
The Chessmen.

04:23.097 --> 04:24.098
That's a gang
that operates out

04:24.265 --> 04:25.683
of the Narrows. What the
hell is a Narrows gang

04:25.850 --> 04:26.976
doing way up here?

04:27.143 --> 04:29.729
I think we both know
someone we can ask.

04:34.317 --> 04:36.194
<i>IS'</i>

04:52.210 --> 04:54.086
<i>IS'</i>

05:13.981 --> 05:14.941
(woman laughs)

05:26.327 --> 05:28.204
<i>IS'</i>

05:58.901 --> 06:00.778
<i>IS'</i>

06:22.258 --> 06:24.385
(indistinct chatter)

06:24.552 --> 06:25.845
Can you check on the fever
in Bed 12?

06:26.012 --> 06:27.138
What's up, Doc?

06:27.597 --> 06:29.557
Heard you were working
here. Interesting.

06:29.724 --> 06:31.142
It's what I do,
help people.

06:31.309 --> 06:33.519
Speaking of which,
I've got patients.

06:33.686 --> 06:36.063
Oh, you wouldn't kick
Jim's baby mama to the curb,

06:36.230 --> 06:38.357
- now, would you?
- Whatever happened between you

06:38.524 --> 06:40.109
and Jim,
it's none of my concern.

06:40.276 --> 06:41.193
So if you're here to gloat...

06:41.360 --> 06:42.862
I'm here for
medical assistance.

06:43.696 --> 06:44.906
For my little nugget.

06:45.698 --> 06:46.616
What do you say?

06:46.782 --> 06:47.450
Be my O.B.?

06:47.617 --> 06:48.826
You can't be serious.

06:48.993 --> 06:50.453
I know we've had
our differences.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.330
You tried
to kill me, Barbara.

06:52.663 --> 06:53.581
Twice.

06:54.290 --> 06:55.958
That was years ago.

06:56.125 --> 06:57.376
There are other doctors here.

06:57.627 --> 06:58.836
Not as good as you.

06:59.378 --> 07:00.296
Look,

07:00.504 --> 07:01.964
whatever you think
of me, my child

07:02.131 --> 07:03.758
is innocent,
and I want the best for it.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.718
And in this place,
that means you.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.180
(sighs)

07:09.597 --> 07:10.598
Does Jim know you're here?

07:10.765 --> 07:12.224
- This is none of his business.
- (door opens)

07:12.642 --> 07:13.476
GORDON:
Lee?

07:17.188 --> 07:18.064
Jim.

07:20.358 --> 07:22.068
- Barbara.
- BARBARA: You're interrupting.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.278
Doctor-patient. Blow.

07:24.528 --> 07:25.738
I'm sorry,
you're her doctor?

07:25.905 --> 07:27.073
No. I don't know.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.450
Maybe.
What are you doing here?

07:30.618 --> 07:31.535
Some bodies turned up.

07:31.702 --> 07:33.204
They might have
a Narrows connection.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.580
I wouldn't have
come, but...

07:34.747 --> 07:36.248
it's important. Right.

07:37.583 --> 07:40.503
You two need to talk.
<i>I'll</i> be outside.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.672
- Uh, I'd rather not.
- If you want me to be your doctor,

07:42.838 --> 07:45.549
you will talk
to the baby's... father.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.469
Your first appointment is next
week. The nurse will give you

07:48.636 --> 07:49.762
all your vitamins
when you leave.

07:49.929 --> 07:50.846
Deal?

07:59.814 --> 08:01.232
Is she really
the only one you could find?

08:01.399 --> 08:03.401
She's the best doctor in
this hellhole of a city.

08:03.609 --> 08:04.860
Not everything is
about Jim Gordon.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.028
Pretty sure this one is.

08:06.195 --> 08:07.780
Because we slept
together. Yeah.

08:08.489 --> 08:10.491
I only told you because I felt
you had a right to know.

08:10.658 --> 08:12.159
But your involvement
in this ended

08:12.326 --> 08:14.120
the moment you put
your pants back on.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.663
(scoffs)

08:18.040 --> 08:19.083
What?

08:20.418 --> 08:21.460
You don't think I'm
fit to be a mother?

08:21.627 --> 08:22.712
What do you think?

08:25.589 --> 08:26.674
Barbara.

08:31.053 --> 08:32.554
(door opens forcefully)

08:32.804 --> 08:34.557
(rats squeaking)

08:50.990 --> 08:52.908
(woman laughing)

09:01.917 --> 09:04.170
(clinking)

09:04.336 --> 09:06.172
(laughing continues)

09:15.973 --> 09:17.933
(speaks inaudibly)

09:18.100 --> 09:20.311
(giggles)

09:24.023 --> 09:25.316
Who are you?

09:26.776 --> 09:28.527
Well, look who decided
to join us.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.779
Hello, champ.

09:34.033 --> 09:35.201
ALFRED:
Master Bruce!

09:35.576 --> 09:36.702
Alfred, how did you...

09:36.994 --> 09:38.287
Look at the state of you.

09:38.579 --> 09:40.706
What have I told you about
rolling around in the muck?

09:42.083 --> 09:44.126
Alfred, what's going on?

09:44.293 --> 09:45.169
Who are these people?

09:45.336 --> 09:46.754
MAN: Whatever do
you mean, Bruce?

09:48.047 --> 09:49.381
We're your parents.

09:51.342 --> 09:52.843
Right. Well,
let's get you spruced up.

09:53.511 --> 09:54.386
After all,

09:55.179 --> 09:56.430
we have a guest.

10:00.184 --> 10:02.394
Welcome home, Bruce.

10:07.358 --> 10:10.402
Jeremiah.
You're alive.

10:10.569 --> 10:14.865
(laughs) Well, you
didn't think Selina

10:15.032 --> 10:16.867
could kill me so
easily, did you?

10:17.118 --> 10:20.454
(laughs) I just had
to put you off my scent

10:20.621 --> 10:23.457
until I could finalize
my... project.

10:24.083 --> 10:25.668
Manners,
Master Bruce.

10:26.168 --> 10:27.378
Let's not be rude
to our guest.

10:27.545 --> 10:29.964
Especially when I
come bearing gifts.

10:31.048 --> 10:33.342
ALFRED:
Oh, Mr. Jeremiah. A cake.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.136
How exceedingly kind
of you.

10:36.011 --> 10:37.263
Is it Italian meringue?

10:38.347 --> 10:39.265
Sure.

10:39.431 --> 10:40.266
Oh.

10:40.766 --> 10:42.268
Now, now, Bruce,
you come

10:42.434 --> 10:44.353
any closer
and I blow up Wayne Manor,

10:44.520 --> 10:45.896
with all of us inside of it.

10:46.063 --> 10:48.023
I have a dozen
more of these, uh,

10:48.440 --> 10:52.111
Italian meringues sprinkled
all throughout the house.

10:53.195 --> 10:54.864
What did you do to Alfred?

10:55.656 --> 10:56.991
And who are these people?

10:57.158 --> 10:58.367
Ah, glad you asked.

10:58.534 --> 10:59.285
Mm, come.

10:59.827 --> 11:00.870
(quietly):
Come, come.

11:02.746 --> 11:05.166
JEREMIAH:
Mommy and Daddy dearest

11:05.749 --> 11:09.336
were just an innocent couple
I kidnapped based on...

11:09.837 --> 11:12.214
bone structure and, um...

11:13.591 --> 11:14.466
build.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.594
Just a touch

11:16.760 --> 11:19.513
of plastic surgery,
and voilé...

11:20.723 --> 11:21.682
Waynes.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.184
(chuckles)

11:23.392 --> 11:25.436
Alfred I nabbed
in the Green Zone.

11:26.061 --> 11:27.479
They're hypnotized.

11:27.646 --> 11:29.190
Well, I'm afraid
there was no room

11:29.356 --> 11:30.816
for improv in
our script.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.484
Today is a...

11:32.776 --> 11:35.196
very important day, Bruce.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.617
Just look at the way
they're dressed.

11:42.328 --> 11:44.163
It's the night
my parents were killed.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.373
And I'm giving
you the chance

11:46.540 --> 11:49.501
to experience it
all over again.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.463
Why?

11:53.088 --> 11:54.548
Isn't it
obvious?

11:58.052 --> 11:59.094
Bruce...

12:00.638 --> 12:01.680
this...

12:02.014 --> 12:05.392
this was the most important day
of your life.

12:07.603 --> 12:09.980
And I didn't get to be
a part of it.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.776
We need to
rectify that.

12:14.068 --> 12:16.278
Alfred. it's
time for dinner.

12:16.987 --> 12:19.740
Chop-chop.
We're on a very tight schedule.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.992
Of course,
Mr. Jeremiah.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.789
(motor chugging)

12:37.758 --> 12:40.761
(explosion)

12:40.928 --> 12:42.763
That's zero for three.

12:44.056 --> 12:44.807
Yes.

12:45.307 --> 12:46.850
It seems the government
was quite thorough

12:47.017 --> 12:49.144
- when they mined the river.
- You didn't have a plan

12:49.311 --> 12:52.064
to get off this rock before
you stole everyone's crap?

12:52.564 --> 12:54.984
I was working on a plan.

12:55.276 --> 12:56.944
The river is mined.

12:57.111 --> 12:59.822
Everything that flies out
gets blown from... the...

12:59.989 --> 13:01.865
- sky.
- What?

13:03.659 --> 13:06.745
Jeremiah was digging a
tunnel under the river.

13:07.871 --> 13:08.872
A tunnel?

13:09.123 --> 13:10.874
(chuckles)
Really?

13:11.208 --> 13:13.377
Do you have any better ideas?

13:17.298 --> 13:18.757
Didn't think so.

13:19.883 --> 13:21.093
It's in the Dark Zone.

13:21.677 --> 13:23.345
We should wait until
night to check it out.

13:23.595 --> 13:26.348
Well, I was running out
of guinea pigs anyway.

13:29.268 --> 13:30.144
Oh, look!

13:30.394 --> 13:31.603
He's swimming to shore.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.480
(explosion)

13:39.320 --> 13:40.029
THOMPKINS:
Are you sure

13:40.195 --> 13:41.947
you should be out
in the Narrows alone?

13:42.114 --> 13:44.408
When the bridges fell, this
place descended into chaos.

13:44.575 --> 13:46.368
Figure our best bet of
getting out in one piece is

13:46.535 --> 13:49.246
- to keep a low profile. - So all the
work I did to make the Narrows better

13:49.413 --> 13:50.914
- was for nothing.
- (loud clattering)

13:51.081 --> 13:52.499
(indistinct shouts,
man whistles)

13:52.666 --> 13:54.710
it's the Leopards.
Rivals of the Chessmen.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.797
(men speaking indistinctly)

14:00.382 --> 14:01.175
About this Barbara thing...

14:01.342 --> 14:02.468
Uh, Jim, just don't.

14:02.634 --> 14:04.845
No, it's important to me
that you understand.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.181
(sighs)

14:07.514 --> 14:09.683
Okay. So, what
are you gonna do?

14:12.811 --> 14:14.772
I don't know,
but it's my child, too.

14:17.358 --> 14:19.526
Barbara seems to have a
difference of opinion.

14:20.402 --> 14:21.487
But hey, people change.

14:22.237 --> 14:23.364
You don't know her
like I do.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.615
You can say that again.

14:24.782 --> 14:27.284
(engine revs, pulls away)

14:27.451 --> 14:28.369
Look.

14:30.662 --> 14:31.622
We're clear.

14:32.790 --> 14:34.249
The Chessmen moved around.

14:34.416 --> 14:36.126
They used these as signals
for their members.

14:36.710 --> 14:37.836
The rook's a compass needle.

14:38.128 --> 14:39.797
North-northeast.
Let's go.

14:39.963 --> 14:41.840
<i>IS'</i>

14:54.812 --> 14:55.521
Hmm.

14:56.522 --> 14:58.857
Alfred told me
such great tidbits

14:59.024 --> 15:00.317
about your childhood.

15:00.859 --> 15:02.694
How you used to eat here,

15:02.945 --> 15:05.656
in the kitchen, when it was
just you and the family.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.699
My, how...

15:07.991 --> 15:10.244
homey and intimate.

15:12.579 --> 15:16.250
Grilled cheese and Branston
pickle sandwich, Mr. Jeremiah.

15:16.417 --> 15:17.668
Master Bruce's favorite.

15:18.001 --> 15:21.255
My influence,
though Thomas did add a dash

15:21.422 --> 15:23.549
of aioli for extra flair.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.302
(laughing)

15:30.139 --> 15:31.723
Oh. Come on, Bruce.

15:31.890 --> 15:34.601
That's a weird favorite
food for a 12-year-old.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.645
I'm playing your game.

15:38.397 --> 15:40.149
Now let Alfred
and these people go.

15:40.315 --> 15:41.400
They're innocent.

15:42.151 --> 15:44.069
I'm sorry, Bruce,
it's just...

15:44.570 --> 15:46.864
it's very important
to me that I get

15:47.114 --> 15:50.200
every detail
exactly right.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.702
Speaking of which...

15:51.952 --> 15:53.454
the final touch.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.835
<i>IS'</i>

16:05.549 --> 16:07.217
What was it like...

16:08.302 --> 16:10.262
losing your parents
that night?

16:10.596 --> 16:11.555
(deep, distorted gunshot)

16:13.640 --> 16:16.477
I lost my family,
too, Bruce.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.771
The wound still
hasn't healed.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.649
I... think about it often.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.485
None of this is real.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.072
You're trying
to manipulate me.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.494
It will never be real.

16:36.371 --> 16:39.666
But you are thinking
about that night.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.127
That's all I need.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.297
I just want to be
connected to you.

16:45.464 --> 16:48.634
I offered for you
to be my best friend!

16:54.765 --> 16:57.059
But I've realized
if we...

16:57.309 --> 16:59.645
can't be friends...

17:00.771 --> 17:03.941
then we can be connected
in other ways.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.654
HOW?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.616
You'll see.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.953
In time.

17:23.919 --> 17:24.836
Hmm.

17:26.338 --> 17:28.674
I'm sorry to cut
tonight short...

17:29.591 --> 17:30.467
but...

17:31.385 --> 17:33.762
your parents and I have
a very important date...

17:33.929 --> 17:34.680
Jeremiah.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.598
- ...with destiny.
- Jeremiah!

17:36.848 --> 17:40.060
You might want to find your
faithful butler and leave.

17:40.852 --> 17:41.853
Quickly.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.648
(steady beeping)

17:45.816 --> 17:46.650
Alfred!

17:50.362 --> 17:52.239
(bell tolling)

17:58.161 --> 17:59.580
The signs lead
this way.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.665
Look at the smoke.

18:01.957 --> 18:03.959
Someone restarted production.

18:05.043 --> 18:09.756
(tanks burbling)

18:22.936 --> 18:24.396
My God, Jim...

18:25.981 --> 18:27.232
look at all of this.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.234
Come on.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.200
- Who's in charge here?
- (softly): Tick tock,

18:37.367 --> 18:38.285
the chemical stock,

18:38.452 --> 18:40.245
shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.414
Tick tock, the chemical stock,

18:42.748 --> 18:44.249
shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.376
Tick tock,
the chemical stock...

18:46.543 --> 18:48.420
...shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

18:48.587 --> 18:49.671
They've been
hypnotized.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.214
<i>T etch .</i>

18:51.381 --> 18:52.466
- (one person clapping)
- WORKERS: Tick tock,

18:52.633 --> 18:53.925
the chemical stock

18:54.426 --> 18:57.095
shall give our Gotham
an aftershock.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.598
My, my, what a thrill.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.600
Jim Gordon...

19:02.643 --> 19:03.894
and the woman
he told me to kill.

19:04.061 --> 19:05.937
(mock gasp)
Brings back memories.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.815
That tea party,
so long ago.

19:09.691 --> 19:12.361
But now, to order these men
to attack my foe!

19:12.527 --> 19:13.278
(Thompkins yelps)

19:15.530 --> 19:17.199
JERVIS:
All for one, and one for all!

19:17.366 --> 19:19.201
Ain't this a grand old ball!

19:19.451 --> 19:20.160
(grunts)

19:22.162 --> 19:24.456
(pipes clanging)

19:25.624 --> 19:26.458
Yoo-hoo!

19:26.958 --> 19:27.876
(gasps) Jim!

19:28.043 --> 19:29.544
Ain't this...

19:29.795 --> 19:32.798
some... game!

19:37.260 --> 19:38.512
Give it to me again?

19:39.513 --> 19:41.181
(sighs) Penguin
has been stealing

19:41.348 --> 19:43.475
everything in the city
that's not nailed down,

19:43.684 --> 19:46.103
and now he needs a way
of getting it off the island.

19:46.395 --> 19:48.855
Hmm. And you're
helping him?

19:49.147 --> 19:50.565
Well, that's what he thinks.

19:51.817 --> 19:53.652
Barbara, Tabitha
was my friend, too.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.862
If anything,
I want to gut the twerp...

19:56.988 --> 19:58.949
- and take his loot.
- Except you don't actually have

19:59.116 --> 20:01.451
- a way out of Gotham.
- I'll find one tonight.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.495
I'll still need your help
moving the stuff.

20:03.662 --> 20:05.455
We can get out of here together.

20:07.457 --> 20:08.792
Away from Jim Gordon.

20:09.459 --> 20:10.919
Rich as Midas.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.713
Penguin dead in a ditch.

20:13.797 --> 20:16.091
Well, aren't we just
two single ladies and a baby

20:16.258 --> 20:18.635
about to kill
our sworn enemy together.

20:19.970 --> 20:20.929
What?

20:21.638 --> 20:23.056
It's just you're pregnant.

20:23.390 --> 20:24.808
Don't even start.

20:28.478 --> 20:29.521
BRUCE (in distance):
Alfred!

20:29.688 --> 20:30.564
(beeping)

20:31.273 --> 20:32.107
(in distance):
Alfred!

20:32.274 --> 20:33.525
(running footsteps)

20:33.734 --> 20:36.570
- (beeping) - Alfred. We
need to get out of here.

20:36.737 --> 20:38.572
Ah, Master Bruce. I was
just taking a quiet moment

20:38.739 --> 20:40.157
- to tidy up.
- We need to go.

20:40.449 --> 20:42.242
- The bombs.
- What bombs?

20:42.701 --> 20:43.827
These bombs.

20:45.662 --> 20:46.913
No need for roughhousing, sir.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.332
(beeping continues)

20:49.916 --> 20:51.251
There has to be a way.

20:52.627 --> 20:54.004
Alfred, you'd do anything
to protect me, right?

20:54.171 --> 20:57.132
- Absolutely, sir.
- There's a gas leak. In the kitchen.

20:57.299 --> 20:59.050
It's only a matter of time
before this whole place goes up.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.386
A gas leak?
Where are your parents?

21:01.553 --> 21:02.846
- Where's our guest?
- I've already warned them.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.639
I know a way out.
Come on!

21:05.766 --> 21:08.810
(rapid beeping)

21:11.104 --> 21:13.064
(deep rumbling)

21:35.378 --> 21:36.505
BRUCE:
Alfred!

21:38.048 --> 21:38.799
Alfred.

21:39.216 --> 21:40.091
(groans)

21:40.967 --> 21:41.635
(groans)

21:42.219 --> 21:43.303
Oh, bloody hell.

21:43.637 --> 21:44.554
Don't move.

21:45.847 --> 21:46.890
Do you, uh...?

21:48.141 --> 21:50.143
Oh, yeah, I remember everything.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.020
Clear as day.

21:52.687 --> 21:53.605
And let me tell you,
if ever I see

21:53.772 --> 21:56.316
that Jervis Tetch character
again I'll stick that watch

21:56.483 --> 21:59.694
so far up his... his nose.

22:01.154 --> 22:02.239
How about you?

22:03.156 --> 22:04.324
You all right?

22:04.866 --> 22:06.284
Yeah, I'm all right.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.912
But the manor...

22:10.163 --> 22:12.123
Don't you worry about that now,
son.

22:12.833 --> 22:14.000
Come on. Help me up.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.711
(grunts, groans)

22:17.128 --> 22:18.046
Oh, your leg's hurt.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.298
Yes, but it's not broken.

22:25.971 --> 22:27.055
(grunts)

22:32.936 --> 22:34.396
I thought I lost you.

22:35.230 --> 22:36.189
Me?

22:37.774 --> 22:39.776
Never, Master Bruce.

22:42.696 --> 22:43.738
Go on.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.575
You know where
he's gonna be at.

22:48.702 --> 22:49.619
Go.

23:02.132 --> 23:03.383
If you're here,

23:04.175 --> 23:06.219
Jeremiah must
still be alive.

23:07.470 --> 23:10.223
And if you're here, I'm guessing
you found our test subjects,

23:10.390 --> 23:13.810
all boiled and bubbled.
(giggles)

23:14.144 --> 23:14.978
What's he planning?

23:15.145 --> 23:18.398
Shh. it's a surprise,
don't you know?

23:19.107 --> 23:21.192
A real killer.

23:21.860 --> 23:24.404
JERVIS: Shall I hypnotize
our friends here,

23:24.571 --> 23:25.989
and have them slit
each other's necks?

23:26.156 --> 23:27.657
ECCO:
(laughs) Nix.

23:27.866 --> 23:29.534
Better check
with the boss.

23:29.993 --> 23:32.412
He might have other ideas.

23:37.125 --> 23:38.793
I'm sorry I got you
involved in this.

23:39.294 --> 23:39.961
Don't be.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.296
I knew what I was
getting myself into.

23:41.421 --> 23:43.173
I know, but, Lee...

23:43.340 --> 23:45.926
Jim, whatever
you want to tell me,

23:46.134 --> 23:47.761
save it till
we're out of here.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.346
Fair enough.

23:50.221 --> 23:52.474
We need to find out
what Valeska's planning.

23:53.475 --> 23:54.476
Hey, Tetch.

23:55.977 --> 23:57.395
You know, it's funny.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.982
I never figured you for
Jeremiah's errand boy.

24:01.399 --> 24:04.444
Oh, Captain.
No errands do I run.

24:04.653 --> 24:07.155
This is simply a way
for me to have some fun.

24:07.322 --> 24:09.616
THOMPKINS: (laughs)
Tell yourself that.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.911
What are you
when you would take away

24:13.078 --> 24:14.829
your games and your rhymes?

24:15.288 --> 24:17.666
Nothing but a second-rater
with a really silly hat.

24:18.541 --> 24:19.668
Shut up.

24:20.210 --> 24:22.045
(whispering)

24:22.337 --> 24:23.713
- (laughs)
- Beautiful.

24:23.880 --> 24:24.798
Beautiful.

24:26.341 --> 24:29.386
Lee Thompkins,
you do intrigue me so.

24:30.053 --> 24:32.305
First, you were a doctor,

24:33.181 --> 24:35.183
then the Narrows queen.

24:35.433 --> 24:36.768
Tell me, please do,

24:37.852 --> 24:39.980
are you running
from your past

24:40.647 --> 24:42.565
when you become
someone new?

24:52.409 --> 24:54.202
(door creaks)

25:06.089 --> 25:07.674
When I found Jeremiah,

25:08.049 --> 25:10.760
he had a bunch of crazies
digging this tunnel for him.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.888
Well, that certainly
fills me with confidence.

25:14.222 --> 25:17.642
- Whoa. You hear that?
- (rustling nearby)

25:18.852 --> 25:20.603
(footsteps approaching)

25:25.150 --> 25:26.776
- Alfred.
- Selina.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.737
What are you doing here?

25:29.863 --> 25:30.864
And with that?

25:31.531 --> 25:33.283
I should ask you
the same thing.

25:33.450 --> 25:34.659
What's down that tunnel?

25:34.868 --> 25:37.037
Well, it was Wayne Manor
till Jeremiah blew it up.

25:38.163 --> 25:39.914
He sealed the only way out
of Gotham.

25:40.665 --> 25:41.583
SELINA:
No.

25:41.750 --> 25:44.544
J-Jeremiah is not alive.
I-l saw him die right here.

25:44.711 --> 25:45.795
Yeah, well, you're wrong.

25:46.546 --> 25:47.672
We all were.

25:48.048 --> 25:50.508
And now he's embarked
on some madcap scheme

25:50.675 --> 25:52.677
where he's reenacting the night
Bruce's parents were killed.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.095
Where's Bruce?

25:54.262 --> 25:55.513
ALFRED: He's gone
after Jeremiah.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.266
He could use your help.

26:01.352 --> 26:02.020
Wait.

26:02.187 --> 26:04.355
Don't you think
that because

26:04.522 --> 26:07.525
I did not kill Jeremiah does
not mean that I won't kill you.

26:07.859 --> 26:08.777
Selina.

26:08.943 --> 26:12.489
You killed my friend Tabitha.

26:13.573 --> 26:14.949
- You deserve to die.
- (grunts)

26:15.116 --> 26:16.159
Selina.

26:17.494 --> 26:19.120
Just put the knife down.

26:21.122 --> 26:22.665
Bruce needs you.

26:26.169 --> 26:28.797
(gasping)

26:39.057 --> 26:40.725
I suppose I should thank you.

26:41.476 --> 26:44.604
Or you could help me
to the Green Zone.

26:45.313 --> 26:47.816
Of course. it's that way.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.000
Jeremiah!

27:07.502 --> 27:09.087
Show yourself!

27:09.587 --> 27:11.506
(dramatic film score playing)

27:28.022 --> 27:29.899
<i>IS'</i>

27:37.157 --> 27:38.116
om!

27:38.950 --> 27:40.493
Hola, Bruce.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.204
Well, here we are,

27:43.454 --> 27:46.749
the theater where your mommy
and daddy took you to see

27:47.041 --> 27:49.377
<i>The Mark of Zorro.</i>

27:50.420 --> 27:51.588
Ha-ha!

27:51.921 --> 27:54.507
I had heard you were obsessed
with this man as a child.

27:54.674 --> 27:57.177
I wonder what it was
that intrigued you so?

27:57.552 --> 27:59.220
Was it the fact
that he struck fear

27:59.387 --> 28:00.972
into the hearts of his enemy?

28:01.139 --> 28:03.516
<i>IS'</i>

28:05.560 --> 28:06.644
Eh garde!

28:07.979 --> 28:08.688
Hee-yah!

28:08.855 --> 28:10.690
Take that, you villain.

28:11.482 --> 28:12.942
Vagabond.

28:14.485 --> 28:15.570
(screaming)

28:15.737 --> 28:17.989
- Scoundrel.
- (screaming)

28:18.239 --> 28:21.367
- (grunting) -
(laughing) <i>_</i> (screaming)

28:21.534 --> 28:23.369
(dramatic music ends)

28:23.536 --> 28:24.996
Warned you.

28:25.830 --> 28:29.083
Perhaps the movie was a bit
too effective.

28:30.668 --> 28:33.796
Isn't this the part where you
became frightened?

28:33.963 --> 28:36.716
When you asked your parents
toleave?

28:37.550 --> 28:38.718
I wonder what would
have happened

28:38.885 --> 28:40.386
if you hadn't done that.

28:40.553 --> 28:43.431
If you had conquered your fear.

28:44.098 --> 28:47.227
Maybe your parents would still
be alive.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.270
<i>IS'</i>

28:52.982 --> 28:55.318
Well, on to the last

28:55.485 --> 28:57.737
and final stop down memory lane.

28:57.904 --> 29:00.198
(filmstrip clicking)

29:04.994 --> 29:06.079
Stop!

29:07.330 --> 29:08.456
Stop!

29:08.623 --> 29:10.291
That's far enough, Bruce.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.626
BRUCE:
Jeremiah.

29:12.627 --> 29:13.920
You don't have to do this.

29:14.087 --> 29:14.921
But I...

29:16.172 --> 29:17.131
I do.

29:18.258 --> 29:21.678
You see, I-l came to this
realization.

29:23.263 --> 29:25.556
I realized that no matter
what I did

29:25.723 --> 29:28.643
to bond us, some random gunman
in an alley

29:28.810 --> 29:31.729
would be the man who you were
tied to the most.

29:32.605 --> 29:35.650
The man you saw
when you closed your eyes.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.654
I want to be the star
of the show.

29:41.656 --> 29:45.451
So if I can't have you as
a brother bonded by love,

29:47.287 --> 29:50.039
then we'll just have
to be bonded by hatred.

29:50.415 --> 29:51.582
BRUCE: And you think
killing two people

29:51.749 --> 29:53.960
that look like my parents
will do that?

29:55.128 --> 29:55.962
It won't.

29:56.129 --> 29:57.463
Well, then it's a good
thing I already put

29:57.630 --> 30:01.092
a bullet in both of their
fraudulent skulls.

30:02.468 --> 30:03.970
Oh, you're confused.

30:04.137 --> 30:06.139
You're wondering if
I already shot them,

30:06.306 --> 30:09.767
then who's this lovely couple?

30:11.269 --> 30:13.062
Thomas, Martha...

30:14.355 --> 30:16.316
...why don't you turn around?

30:30.788 --> 30:33.041
- Jim!
- (Jeremiah laughs)

30:33.207 --> 30:34.375
I know.

30:34.751 --> 30:37.837
See, 0-over the course
of our little adventure,

30:38.004 --> 30:42.091
fate brought to me James Gordon
and Leslie Thompkins,

30:42.258 --> 30:46.846
and I thought to myself,
why not...

30:48.306 --> 30:50.558
why not kill the man
who you think of

30:50.725 --> 30:52.769
as your second father figure?

30:53.311 --> 30:55.730
And your dear, dear,

30:55.897 --> 30:59.233
dear friend Lee Thompkins.

31:00.193 --> 31:01.527
And when I do,

31:02.236 --> 31:04.947
finally, you and I
will be bound together.

31:05.198 --> 31:06.199
Because you see...

31:06.407 --> 31:08.868
("La Cucaracha" plays)

31:12.413 --> 31:16.250
...re-unification with the
mainland hangs on by a thread.

31:16.501 --> 31:17.960
Those fireworks go off

31:18.294 --> 31:20.922
and toxic chemicals rain down
onto the city,

31:21.089 --> 31:23.174
and the government...
(clicks tongue)

31:23.341 --> 31:25.176
...cuts us adrift for good.

31:31.682 --> 31:32.475
BRUCE:
Jeremiah.

31:34.185 --> 31:34.977
Don't.

31:35.353 --> 31:36.312
Shh.

31:36.938 --> 31:39.107
The piéce de résistance.

31:39.857 --> 31:41.359
One last thing.

31:41.776 --> 31:43.986
I had Jervis Tetch
hypnotize them

31:44.153 --> 31:45.571
so that they'll wake up
the moment

31:45.738 --> 31:49.450
these beautiful pearls hit
the ground.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.162
I want you to see them realize
what I've done to them

31:53.329 --> 31:56.416
as the life drains
from their bodies.

31:57.500 --> 31:58.835
Never forget,

31:59.544 --> 32:01.712
this is all for you, Bruce.

32:02.380 --> 32:03.256
No!

32:10.680 --> 32:12.098
Selina! The pearls!

32:24.277 --> 32:26.487
Ecco! Now!

32:27.780 --> 32:31.534
(timer beeping)

32:34.829 --> 32:35.788
We need to stop
the fireworks.

32:35.955 --> 32:36.998
- They're gonna...
- I know.

32:37.331 --> 32:39.500
You go after Jeremiah and Ecco.
I'll take the truck!

32:44.255 --> 32:45.715
There's no way to stop them all.

32:46.507 --> 32:47.842
Get to Harvey.

32:48.801 --> 32:51.429
Warn the people in
the Green Zone to get to cover.

32:51.804 --> 32:54.724
What are you... Jim!

33:03.232 --> 33:04.609
Jeremiah!

33:05.234 --> 33:06.277
Face me!

33:07.153 --> 33:08.321
Here, Bruce.

33:34.388 --> 33:35.765
(beeping rapidW)

33:49.904 --> 33:51.322
Jeremiah!

33:52.949 --> 33:54.075
This ends.

33:54.992 --> 33:57.870
- Tonight.
- No.

33:58.412 --> 34:00.456
No, Bruce. Now it begins.

34:00.623 --> 34:01.666
Flaughs)

34:16.847 --> 34:17.848
(groans)

34:18.139 --> 34:19.433
Yes.

34:20.184 --> 34:23.396
You feel it.
The connection between us.

34:24.230 --> 34:25.273
You do.

34:25.481 --> 34:28.234
Don't you? Bruce, you feel it.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.319
Tell me you feel it.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.821
(groans)

34:33.906 --> 34:35.949
You mean nothing to me.

34:40.830 --> 34:43.040
Why don't you understand?

34:45.918 --> 34:47.460
You need me.

34:48.337 --> 34:50.922
I'm the answer
to your life's question!

34:51.799 --> 34:54.342
Without me,
you're just a joke...

34:57.305 --> 34:59.348
...without a punch line.

35:27.001 --> 35:28.878
<i>IS'</i>

36:00.368 --> 36:01.952
After all this time,

36:02.662 --> 36:05.581
you've come to me for help.

36:06.415 --> 36:09.627
After allowing Strange
to put a chip into my brain.

36:09.794 --> 36:11.629
Attempting to sell me out
to Gordon.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.422
And after naming...

36:15.508 --> 36:17.385
...a dog after me.

36:17.802 --> 36:18.886
First of all,

36:19.679 --> 36:22.473
lam very fond of that dog.

36:22.682 --> 36:27.520
Secondly, I had Hugo Strange
save your life.

36:27.728 --> 36:30.022
Thirdly, do you really think

36:30.189 --> 36:31.023
I didn't have plans

36:31.190 --> 36:34.276
to save you from Jim Gordon?

36:34.443 --> 36:36.487
(chuckles)

36:37.238 --> 36:39.490
You always have an answer for
everything, don't you, Oswald?

36:40.408 --> 36:44.120
We have been
through all of this before.

36:44.286 --> 36:45.788
I've tried to kill you.

36:46.455 --> 36:48.124
You've tried to kill me.

36:48.958 --> 36:51.544
But here we are in this room.

36:51.919 --> 36:52.920
Together.

36:55.339 --> 36:57.717
It means fate has
different plans for us.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.306
What are these plans?

37:05.349 --> 37:07.518
Haven't you realized
what Gotham is yet?

37:08.436 --> 37:10.312
It is no longer a city.

37:11.188 --> 37:12.606
It is a prison.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.360
And I think it's time
we escaped.

37:31.584 --> 37:32.877
You heard the news?

37:33.169 --> 37:34.545
Everybody's
talking about it.

37:35.254 --> 37:37.006
Reunification
isn't happening.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.383
Word of the chemical spill
reached the mainland.

37:39.925 --> 37:43.304
No action until the government
can determine if Gotham is safe.

37:43.804 --> 37:45.723
I figure at least
a couple of months.

37:47.016 --> 37:48.476
You don't sound surprised.

37:49.393 --> 37:50.603
Guess I'm not.

37:52.396 --> 37:53.856
Could've been much worse.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.317
- You stopped that.
- (sighs)

37:56.609 --> 37:58.152
Every time I think
we're turning things around,

37:58.319 --> 38:00.863
I look up--
right back where we started.

38:12.333 --> 38:13.876
What were you
about to say to me

38:14.376 --> 38:16.253
when, uh, Tetch had us?

38:22.009 --> 38:23.219
I don't know.

38:24.136 --> 38:27.306
I guess I, uh,
would have said...

38:28.682 --> 38:30.976
what I said the last time
we saw each other.

38:34.814 --> 38:36.649
I wish I could go back.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.944
Do things differently.

38:40.861 --> 38:41.821
Better.

38:46.200 --> 38:49.328
- It feels like a long time ago.
- Nothing's changed.

38:50.412 --> 38:51.997
But it has, Jim.

38:54.375 --> 38:55.125
That was a mistake.

38:55.292 --> 38:56.377
A mistake?

38:57.044 --> 39:00.005
Put yourself in my shoes.
After everything you said,

39:00.172 --> 39:03.425
suddenly you're having a baby
with Barbara, of all people.

39:07.346 --> 39:08.764
But it's not just that.

39:10.057 --> 39:11.308
You talk about doing
things differently

39:11.475 --> 39:12.852
and I keep thinking,

39:14.854 --> 39:16.772
what if we hadn't lost ours?

39:24.697 --> 39:26.323
What are you doing here, Lee?

39:29.869 --> 39:30.995
I don't know.

39:32.496 --> 39:34.957
I know you've taken
on so much, and...

39:36.375 --> 39:38.377
and I want to be
understanding, but...

39:40.212 --> 39:41.755
you let me down, Jim.

39:45.384 --> 39:46.594
I'm sorry.

39:51.557 --> 39:53.893
- What does that mean?
- (sighs)

39:54.310 --> 39:55.394
<i>For us'?</i>

39:56.103 --> 39:57.146
I don't know.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.107
Can't change the past,

40:00.274 --> 40:02.860
so I guess we just
have to live with it.

40:06.405 --> 40:07.740
No, Lee...

40:25.132 --> 40:27.009
(monitor beeping steadily)

40:29.887 --> 40:33.474
SELINA: I can't believe
he's still alive.

40:34.433 --> 40:37.436
They've been doing scans,
and he has no brain activity.

40:38.562 --> 40:40.314
He's no longer a threat.

40:42.900 --> 40:44.485
To either of us.

40:51.533 --> 40:53.661
Thank you for coming to help me.

40:57.414 --> 40:58.540
That night your parents
were killed,

40:58.707 --> 41:00.751
I should have done something.

41:02.753 --> 41:04.505
Selina, you've done enough.

41:11.929 --> 41:14.807
(thunder rumbles)

41:16.141 --> 41:17.935
it's not much, but it's home.

41:18.102 --> 41:20.145
I've been looking through
your treasure trove.

41:20.729 --> 41:23.482
- You've been a very naughty boy.
- Barbara?

41:23.691 --> 41:25.025
How did you...

41:26.694 --> 41:27.611
Sefina?

41:28.028 --> 41:31.740
Hmm. She and I
were gonna go murder-halfsies

41:31.907 --> 41:33.575
to get you back for Tabitha,

41:33.826 --> 41:36.453
but it seems I will have to do
the dirty work myself,

41:36.620 --> 41:37.746
as usual.

41:37.913 --> 41:39.039
NYGMA:
Oh, my God.

41:41.375 --> 41:42.626
You're pregnant.

41:45.129 --> 41:47.756
- How could you possibly know that?
- Look at you.

41:48.173 --> 41:49.258
She's glowing.

41:49.883 --> 41:51.260
You're glowing.

41:51.802 --> 41:54.430
How very observant of you.
Adieu, Oswald.

41:54.638 --> 41:55.681
Wait!

41:56.390 --> 41:57.641
Come with us.

41:59.018 --> 42:00.853
- What?
- Yes.

42:01.729 --> 42:04.023
I killed Tabitha.

42:04.565 --> 42:05.607
You're angry.

42:05.941 --> 42:08.610
You want revenge.
But do you really want

42:08.777 --> 42:12.948
to raise your child
in a toxic waste war zone?

42:14.241 --> 42:15.826
Come with us.

42:17.494 --> 42:19.872
Are you telling me
you found a way out of Gotham?

42:20.456 --> 42:21.331
Ed did.

42:24.334 --> 42:25.461
It's a submarine.

42:26.128 --> 42:27.379
- A submarine?
- It can track

42:27.546 --> 42:29.673
mines in the river using sonar.

42:32.885 --> 42:34.178
So, where's this submarine?

42:40.017 --> 42:41.101
We have to build it.

42:41.393 --> 42:42.853
- Yeah, I'm gonna shoot you.
- (whimpers)

42:45.481 --> 42:46.440
God.

42:47.775 --> 42:48.942
What is happening to me?

42:49.777 --> 42:51.278
- Perhaps...
- Shut up!

42:51.445 --> 42:53.238
That was a
rhetorical question.

42:55.407 --> 42:56.575
(sighs)

42:57.701 --> 42:58.994
Fine.

42:59.661 --> 43:02.498
I won't shoot you
for the sake of my child.

43:03.373 --> 43:06.543
- But I will never forgive you.
- Of course.

43:07.544 --> 43:09.088
I understand.

43:13.801 --> 43:15.010
Call me when it's done.

43:15.177 --> 43:17.471
- So, who's the lucky father?
- Shut up!
