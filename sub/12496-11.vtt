on Henry Danger...

00:04.458 --> 00:05.625
- I got--

00:10.333 --> 00:12.166
- What right do I have

00:10.333 --> 00:12.166
to take you around with me

00:12.208 --> 00:14.208
and put you in all kinds

00:12.208 --> 00:14.208

00:14.250 --> 00:16.542
- Hey! I wanted this job

00:14.250 --> 00:16.542
and you need a sidekick.

00:16.583 --> 00:18.917
- I wish we could make

00:16.583 --> 00:18.917
Henry indestructible.

00:18.959 --> 00:21.834
- Too bad the machine that made

00:18.959 --> 00:21.834
me indestructible was destroyed.

00:21.875 --> 00:23.959
- The Densitizer

00:21.875 --> 00:23.959
was never destroyed.

00:24.000 --> 00:25.417
- Piper's cooking dinner?!

00:25.458 --> 00:27.709
- Shh!

00:27.750 --> 00:29.834
- Well, I'm getting' outta here.

00:29.875 --> 00:32.417
- The Densitizer's been here

00:29.875 --> 00:32.417
the whole time I've known you?

00:32.458 --> 00:34.208
- Yes.

00:32.458 --> 00:34.208
- Then why can't Henry

00:34.250 --> 00:35.333
be densitized?

00:35.375 --> 00:37.291
- Because it won't work.

00:39.083 --> 00:40.375
- Oh jeez!

00:40.417 --> 00:43.583
- I say you can be made

00:40.417 --> 00:43.583

00:48.834 --> 00:51.583
Retreat! Retreat!

00:51.625 --> 00:54.291
- We are doing this again

00:51.625 --> 00:54.291
tomorrow night.

00:54.333 --> 00:55.709
- Woah!

00:59.875 --> 01:01.250
- You okay? How do you feel?

01:01.291 --> 01:03.834
- Maybe we should test--

01:03.875 --> 01:06.333
I'm okay!

01:06.375 --> 01:08.375
- Oh my god!

01:06.375 --> 01:08.375
You're indestructible!

01:08.417 --> 01:10.750
- Yeah, I am!

01:10.792 --> 01:13.250
- And here we go.

01:10.792 --> 01:13.250
First joke of the morning.

01:13.291 --> 01:17.583
What did Jay-Z call his wife

01:13.291 --> 01:17.583
before they got married?

01:17.625 --> 01:18.667
- I dunno, what?

01:18.709 --> 01:20.542
- Fiancee!

01:27.750 --> 01:31.166
- Oh, man. This is not good.

01:34.875 --> 01:38.041
- Charlotte. Charlotte.

01:34.875 --> 01:38.041
Charlotte. Charlotte...

01:41.208 --> 01:43.041
- What's up?

01:41.208 --> 01:43.041
- Okay...

01:43.083 --> 01:45.041
You remember how, yesterday,

01:43.083 --> 01:45.041
after I was densitized,

01:45.083 --> 01:47.000
you and Schwoz asked me

01:45.083 --> 01:47.000
if I had any side-effects,

01:47.041 --> 01:49.333
and I said no, I didn't

01:47.041 --> 01:49.333
have any side-effects?

01:49.375 --> 01:50.500
- Yeah?

01:50.542 --> 01:51.834
- I think I have a side-effect.

01:51.875 --> 01:54.583
- Ugh, I knew it.

01:54.625 --> 01:56.500
So what side-effect

01:54.625 --> 01:56.500
do you have?

01:56.542 --> 01:58.542
Did you grow eyeballs

01:56.542 --> 01:58.542
on your butt?!?

01:58.583 --> 02:00.375
- No!

02:02.208 --> 02:03.500
- No! No!

02:03.542 --> 02:05.250
- Then what side-effect

02:03.542 --> 02:05.250
do you have?

02:05.291 --> 02:07.583
- When I laugh,

02:05.291 --> 02:07.583
fire comes out my--

02:07.625 --> 02:08.834
- Henry!

02:08.875 --> 02:10.834
- D'ah! Piper's at my door.

02:10.875 --> 02:12.917
- Okay, but tell me

02:10.875 --> 02:12.917

Just come over!

02:16.542 --> 02:18.709
Okay Piper, just a sec--

02:20.250 --> 02:22.375

- Did you just kick

02:22.417 --> 02:24.834

02:24.875 --> 02:26.709
- Mom said you had

02:24.875 --> 02:26.709

02:26.750 --> 02:28.500
Where are they?

02:28.542 --> 02:30.083
- Wait...

02:32.166 --> 02:35.375
It wasn't even locked!

02:35.417 --> 02:37.709
Will you get outta

02:35.417 --> 02:37.709
my closet?

02:37.750 --> 02:39.083
- What is this thing?

02:39.125 --> 02:41.500
- Oh, it's a Vomiting

02:39.125 --> 02:41.500
Vinnie doll.

02:41.542 --> 02:43.375
- Why would they call--

02:45.125 --> 02:47.750

02:53.291 --> 02:55.208
- Uh, did you just see that?

02:55.250 --> 02:59.375
- I can't see anything!

02:55.250 --> 02:59.375
Your doll vomited in my eyes!

03:00.834 --> 03:04.166
Mom! Henry's doll

03:00.834 --> 03:04.166
vomited in my eyes!

03:05.875 --> 03:07.333
- It all just kind

03:05.875 --> 03:07.333
of happened.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.542
- My dad was

03:07.375 --> 03:09.542
an irresponsible scientist.

03:09.583 --> 03:11.542
- I wanted an after-school

03:09.583 --> 03:11.542
job.

03:11.583 --> 03:14.375
- And by accident,

03:11.583 --> 03:14.375
he made me indestructible.

03:14.417 --> 03:16.250
Ah!

03:16.291 --> 03:19.875
- I went into this crazy store

03:16.291 --> 03:19.875
and met a pretty interesting guy

03:19.917 --> 03:21.458
- I'm going to blow your mind.

03:21.500 --> 03:23.959
Now I protect the good

03:21.500 --> 03:23.959
citizens of Swellview.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.166
who call me...

03:25.208 --> 03:26.166
- He turned out to be...

03:26.208 --> 03:27.208
- You know the name.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.166
- Captain Man!

03:28.208 --> 03:29.709
- That's right, Henry.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.417
In time, I realized

03:29.750 --> 03:32.417
that being a superhero

03:32.458 --> 03:33.875
is a lot to handle alone.

03:33.917 --> 03:35.000
- He wanted some help.

03:35.041 --> 03:36.500
- I needed a sidekick.

03:36.542 --> 03:38.250
- I, Henry Hart...

03:36.542 --> 03:38.250
- Pledge to never ever

03:38.291 --> 03:40.208
ever tell anyone...

03:38.291 --> 03:40.208
- That I'm Captain Man's

03:40.250 --> 03:41.750
secret sidekick.

03:40.250 --> 03:41.750
- It is done.

03:41.792 --> 03:43.375
- Now we blow bubbles.

03:43.417 --> 03:44.583
- And fight crime.

- Feels good.

- Up the tube!

Oh, my boot.

- Ha !

- I'm so mad.

04:14.083 --> 04:16.834
- Well, baby, the doll's name

04:14.083 --> 04:16.834
is Vomiting Vinnie.

04:16.875 --> 04:19.041
What'd you expect him to do?

04:19.083 --> 04:19.834
Vinnie?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.875
- Hey, Mrs. Hart?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.875

- Chicken breasts?

04:28.542 --> 04:30.542
- Yeah, chicken... those.

04:30.583 --> 04:35.041
- Dude, just go buy everything

04:30.583 --> 04:35.041
on that grocery list.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.792
- But it's gonna be

04:35.083 --> 04:36.792
almost a hundred bucks!

04:36.834 --> 04:38.291
Why do I have to pay?

04:36.834 --> 04:38.291

04:50.917 --> 04:52.375
- No!

04:50.917 --> 04:52.375
- But maybe...

04:52.417 --> 04:53.834

04:53.875 --> 04:56.166

05:01.375 --> 05:04.083

08:23.917 --> 08:26.875
You just took a cannon ball

08:26.917 --> 08:28.709
to the gut

08:26.917 --> 08:28.709
at point blank range!

08:28.750 --> 08:30.083
- Yeah...

08:31.792 --> 08:34.125
- Henry, did you...

08:43.500 --> 08:44.500
- Ow.

08:51.333 --> 08:53.166
Ow.

08:53.208 --> 08:57.458
- You're...

08:53.208 --> 08:57.458
you're indestructible.

08:59.208 --> 09:02.333
- [ both ] Surprise.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.583
- We did it yesterday.

09:06.625 --> 09:09.500
- And it worked?

09:06.625 --> 09:09.500
That's amazing!

09:09.542 --> 09:11.500
No side-effects!

09:11.542 --> 09:13.875
- Eh.

09:27.208 --> 09:29.875
- Okay. I'm ready to test him.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.291
- Finally.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.291
- Here we go.

09:31.333 --> 09:34.250
- So, is Henry fully

09:31.333 --> 09:34.250
indestructible?

09:34.291 --> 09:35.959
- Oh ya, he is.

09:36.000 --> 09:38.959
- Or else your cannon

09:36.000 --> 09:38.959
woulda killed me.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.083
- I know, we lucked out

09:39.000 --> 09:43.083
on that one, didn't we?

09:45.709 --> 09:47.625
- So what about Henry

09:45.709 --> 09:47.625
laughing fire?

09:47.667 --> 09:49.417
- That's what we're going

09:47.667 --> 09:49.417
to test right now.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.625
Now Henry, you sit still,

09:49.458 --> 09:52.625
and watch me and Ray.

09:52.667 --> 09:53.667
- What are we doin'?

09:53.709 --> 09:55.166
- Come, come...

09:58.208 --> 10:02.709
- Now, we begin the test

09:58.208 --> 10:02.709
with my homemade Schwoz-amole.

10:04.792 --> 10:06.291
- Ah, darn it.

10:06.333 --> 10:08.834
My Schwoz-amole smells funky.

10:10.500 --> 10:12.750
- Really? Here, let me smell it.

10:15.709 --> 10:16.709
- Schwoz!

10:30.250 --> 10:33.375
- Okay, when the machine

10:30.250 --> 10:33.375
make Henry indestructible,

10:33.417 --> 10:36.208
it also mutated

10:33.417 --> 10:36.208
his throat muscles,

10:36.250 --> 10:38.875
and that's why fire

10:36.250 --> 10:38.875
now shoots from his mouth

10:38.917 --> 10:39.917
when he laughs.

10:39.959 --> 10:42.959
- Well...awesome!

10:43.000 --> 10:44.291
- What?

10:43.000 --> 10:44.291
- Dude!

10:44.333 --> 10:46.208
- How is this awesome?

10:44.333 --> 10:46.208
- Because!

10:46.250 --> 10:47.959
Now, whenever Henry

10:46.250 --> 10:47.959
and I fight bad guys,

10:48.000 --> 10:49.583
if one of them

10:48.000 --> 10:49.583
pulls a weapon,

10:49.625 --> 10:52.041
all Henry's gotta do

10:49.625 --> 10:52.041
is be all, "Hahaha".

10:52.083 --> 10:55.208
and the bad guys'll be like,

10:52.083 --> 10:55.208
"Ahh, my face is melting."

10:55.250 --> 10:57.208
Why did I commit this crime?"

10:57.250 --> 11:00.083
And I'll be like, "Exactly."

11:00.125 --> 11:04.166
- Oh, yeah, but what if

11:00.125 --> 11:04.166
I'm out with a girl and I laugh,

11:04.208 --> 11:05.542
and then she's all:

11:05.583 --> 11:07.417
"Oh no! Why did I go out

11:05.583 --> 11:07.417
with this guy?

11:07.458 --> 11:10.041
He's shooting fire at my face!"

11:10.083 --> 11:13.083
- He's right,

11:10.083 --> 11:13.083
girls do not like that.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.291
- So I mean, what do we do?

11:15.333 --> 11:16.917
- Ugh... Pfft...

11:16.959 --> 11:19.041
- Well, maybe I can make

11:16.959 --> 11:19.041
some technical adjustments

11:19.083 --> 11:20.875
to the Densitizer machine--

11:20.917 --> 11:23.041
- Whoah, whoah, so that Henry

11:20.917 --> 11:23.041
could stay indestructible,

11:23.083 --> 11:24.792
but not laugh with fire?

11:24.834 --> 11:27.125
- Okay, uh, who is Schwoz?

11:24.834 --> 11:27.125
Uh, you?

11:27.166 --> 11:29.208
- No.

11:27.166 --> 11:29.208
- Then maybe you let me

11:29.250 --> 11:33.000
say the Schwoz things.

11:29.250 --> 11:33.000
How about that?

11:33.041 --> 11:35.291
- 'Kay, let's all just go

11:33.041 --> 11:35.291
check out the Densitizer,

11:35.333 --> 11:37.458
and see if Schwoz can figure

11:35.333 --> 11:37.458
out a way to--

11:37.500 --> 11:40.166
- Oh wait. Hang on a sec.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.166
Hang on a sec.

11:40.208 --> 11:41.834
Hey, Dad, what's up?

11:40.208 --> 11:41.834
- Where are you?

11:41.875 --> 11:44.083
It's almost dinner time.

11:44.125 --> 11:46.458
- Oh, dinner...

11:46.500 --> 11:48.166
- No, no, no.

11:46.500 --> 11:48.166
- You can't go have dinner

11:48.208 --> 11:49.583
with your family!

11:49.625 --> 11:51.333
- What if you laugh?

11:51.375 --> 11:53.375
- Uh, you know, Dad,

11:51.375 --> 11:53.375
I'm kinda stuck at work

11:53.417 --> 11:55.083
so I don't, I don't think I'm

11:53.417 --> 11:55.083
gonna' be able to--

11:55.125 --> 11:57.208
- Henry, if you're not home

11:55.125 --> 11:57.208
for dinner in exactly

11:57.250 --> 11:59.750
twenty four minutes,

11:57.250 --> 11:59.750
I'll tell your mother you said

11:59.792 --> 12:01.750
she smells bad.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.917
- What? I never said that

12:01.792 --> 12:03.917
about Mom!

12:03.959 --> 12:06.750
- Hey Honey! Guess what Henry

12:03.959 --> 12:06.750
just said about you!

12:06.792 --> 12:08.709
- Okay, I'm on my way!

12:11.041 --> 12:12.583
- Okay guys, I gotta go home.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.792
But as soon as I'm done

12:12.625 --> 12:14.792
with dinner we got...

12:16.125 --> 12:18.417
- Well, I like the

12:16.125 --> 12:18.417
Schwoz-amole.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.583
Don't judge me.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.166
- Okay! Dinner's ready!

12:40.208 --> 12:42.458
- I'm here!

12:40.208 --> 12:42.458
Mom, you smell great.

12:44.333 --> 12:45.709
- Thanks?

12:45.750 --> 12:49.125
- Okay, who's hungry

12:45.750 --> 12:49.125
for my food?

12:49.166 --> 12:51.125
- Eh...

12:49.166 --> 12:51.125
- Uh...

12:51.166 --> 12:53.792
- Oh! Uh, wait one thing

12:51.166 --> 12:53.792
before we all have dinner...

12:53.834 --> 12:55.667
- What's that?

12:53.834 --> 12:55.667
- What?

12:55.709 --> 12:58.458
- Well, I mean, I just feel

12:55.709 --> 12:58.458
that Piper worked really hard

12:58.500 --> 13:00.709
to make this dinner,

12:58.500 --> 13:00.709
so we should all take it

13:00.750 --> 13:02.834
very seriously.

13:02.875 --> 13:06.333
Like, nobody should

13:02.875 --> 13:06.333
make any jokes or...

13:06.375 --> 13:09.583
do anything funny,

13:06.375 --> 13:09.583
especially unexpectedly.

13:09.625 --> 13:13.542
- Okay, everyone sit down.

13:13.583 --> 13:16.208
- Wait! We have to wait

13:13.583 --> 13:16.208
for Jasper and his cousin.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.667
- Ooh, that's right.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.375
- Wait, Jasper's bringing

13:17.709 --> 13:19.375
his cousin?

13:19.417 --> 13:21.750
- Yeah! The one who's

13:19.417 --> 13:21.750
a stand-up comedian.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.333
- We're here. We're hungry.

13:23.917 --> 13:26.333
Get used to it.

13:26.375 --> 13:28.542
- Oh man.

13:28.583 --> 13:31.000
- Ah, you're Dex Dunlop!

13:31.041 --> 13:33.000
- He's my second cousin.

13:33.041 --> 13:37.250
- Yeah, don't say that out loud.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.625
- So Dex, I hear you won

13:38.625 --> 13:41.625
best comedian in Swellview.

13:41.667 --> 13:43.542
- Well--

13:41.667 --> 13:43.542
- He sure did.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.542
There's nobody funnier

13:43.583 --> 13:45.542
than my cuz.

13:45.583 --> 13:49.250
- Thanks, comin' from you

13:45.583 --> 13:49.250
that means so little.

13:52.417 --> 13:53.709
- Burn!

14:01.083 --> 14:02.917
- Googles on.

14:02.959 --> 14:06.291
- Come on! Are we gonna'

14:02.959 --> 14:06.291
start this test or what?

14:06.333 --> 14:08.041
- Yeah! Here we go.

14:08.083 --> 14:11.959
Voosh...veek...Veezle!

14:23.583 --> 14:25.000
- Disengage!

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
- So how'd it go?

14:39.917 --> 14:42.000
- What went wrong?

14:39.917 --> 14:42.000
- Ah, he tried to run too much

14:42.041 --> 14:43.583
power through this thing.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.792
- Well, I need some kind

14:43.625 --> 14:45.792
of conductor to connect

14:45.834 --> 14:48.667
the particle Densitizer

14:45.834 --> 14:48.667
to the molecular transducer!

14:48.709 --> 14:50.709
- Dude, there's nothing in

14:48.709 --> 14:50.709
Swellview that'll conduct

14:50.750 --> 14:52.583
that much power

14:50.750 --> 14:52.583
without melting or burning out.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.333
- Well, don't you think

14:52.625 --> 14:54.333
I know that?

14:56.041 --> 14:58.000
- Wait, hang on...

14:58.041 --> 15:00.333
don't human beings

14:58.041 --> 15:00.333
conduct electricity?

15:00.375 --> 15:01.542
Our bodies?

15:01.583 --> 15:03.417
- Well, sure.

15:01.583 --> 15:03.417
- Yeah, but if we try to use

15:03.458 --> 15:05.125
a human being to connect

15:05.166 --> 15:07.291
the particle Densitizer

15:05.166 --> 15:07.291
to the molecular transducer,

15:07.333 --> 15:10.125
the person would be fried

15:07.333 --> 15:10.125
like a Mexican fish stick.

15:10.166 --> 15:14.500
- Uh, not if that

15:10.166 --> 15:14.500
person were...

15:14.542 --> 15:16.500
indestructible.

15:23.041 --> 15:26.041
- So, how does everybody

15:23.041 --> 15:26.041
like my tuna parmesan?

15:26.083 --> 15:28.333
- Oh, it's so good.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.333
- Oh, it's great.

15:28.375 --> 15:29.792
- I'm lovin' it.

15:29.834 --> 15:32.875
- Yay! I'll get more tuna sauce.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.834
- Here's more sauce.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.000
- Oh, thank god.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.000
- Yay.

15:49.208 --> 15:51.208
- So, Dex...

15:49.208 --> 15:51.208
- Yeah.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.583
- Tell me one

15:51.250 --> 15:54.583
of your insult jokes.

15:54.625 --> 15:58.792
- No! Please, no jokes.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.458
I mean, we're all here

15:58.834 --> 16:01.458
for Piper's wonderful dinner,

16:01.500 --> 16:04.041
so nobody say anything funny.

16:06.208 --> 16:09.834
- Well, in that case,

16:06.208 --> 16:09.834
Jasper should tell the jokes.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.750
- Just kidding, I'll do one.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.750
Uh, knock knock.

16:15.792 --> 16:17.458
- Ooh. Who's there?

16:17.500 --> 16:20.417
- Idiot.

16:17.500 --> 16:20.417
- Idiot who?

16:20.458 --> 16:24.000
- You. You're an idiot.

16:27.417 --> 16:28.792
- I walked right into that one.

16:28.834 --> 16:31.250
- It's funny 'cause it's true.

16:32.709 --> 16:34.792
- Do another joke!

16:34.834 --> 16:37.333
- All right.

16:34.834 --> 16:37.333
Uh, you guys like magic?

16:37.375 --> 16:38.291
- Yeah! Yeah!

16:38.333 --> 16:40.166
- I like serious magic.

16:40.208 --> 16:42.750
'Cause, magic is like an art,

16:40.208 --> 16:42.750
and it should be taken seriously

16:42.792 --> 16:44.125
and never laughed at.

16:44.166 --> 16:47.000
So, let's keep the magic

16:44.166 --> 16:47.000
serious, okay?

16:49.166 --> 16:52.291
- All right, here's some

16:49.166 --> 16:52.291
"serious" magic.

16:55.667 --> 16:58.959
[ blows nose ]

17:03.750 --> 17:04.959
- That's a lot of mucus.

17:06.375 --> 17:10.667
- All right. Now Jasper,

17:06.375 --> 17:10.667
hold out your hand.

17:10.709 --> 17:12.500
Now squeeze it tight.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.917
- 'Kay...

17:15.792 --> 17:17.625
Okay what's next?

17:17.667 --> 17:20.000
- Nothin'! I'm done.

17:23.875 --> 17:26.291
- He made me squeeze

17:23.875 --> 17:26.291
the snot! Haha!

17:37.500 --> 17:38.792
- Woo.

17:38.834 --> 17:41.000
[ phone rings ]

17:41.041 --> 17:43.041
- Hey Kid! Listen--

17:43.083 --> 17:44.417
- Okay, don't say anything funny

17:44.458 --> 17:46.166
or I'll end up

17:44.458 --> 17:46.166
roasting my wrist!

17:46.208 --> 17:47.834
- Relax, you're

17:46.208 --> 17:47.834
indestructible now.

17:47.875 --> 17:49.375
- It'll still hurt!

17:49.417 --> 17:51.417
- So, I'm hoping to be

17:49.417 --> 17:51.417
on The Tonight Show,

17:51.458 --> 17:54.834
'cause I'm pretty sure

17:51.458 --> 17:54.834
Jimmy Fallon would love me.

17:59.625 --> 18:01.083
- What?

18:01.125 --> 18:03.875
- Did you just put my food

18:01.125 --> 18:03.875
under the table?

18:03.917 --> 18:06.333
- Uh... what's a table?

18:07.291 --> 18:08.458
- Hey, quick thinking.

18:15.834 --> 18:17.917
- Anyone else?

18:24.291 --> 18:27.667
- So, you've all been putting

18:24.291 --> 18:27.667
my tuna parmesan under the table

18:27.709 --> 18:29.542
this whole time?!

18:29.583 --> 18:31.333
- Sweetie, we're not saying

18:29.583 --> 18:31.333
that your food is awful...

18:31.375 --> 18:32.875
- Then what are you saying?

18:32.917 --> 18:36.208
- That...

18:36.250 --> 18:39.083
it's really bad!

18:39.125 --> 18:40.709
- So, what do you mean?

18:40.750 --> 18:43.291
- Yeah, we think we re-rigged

18:40.750 --> 18:43.291
the Densitizer

18:43.333 --> 18:44.834
so it'll fix your fire problem.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.083
- You do?

18:46.125 --> 18:48.125
- Yeah, so just hurry up

18:46.125 --> 18:48.125
and get to the Man Cave.

18:48.166 --> 18:49.667
- Okay, but first

18:48.166 --> 18:49.667
I gotta find a way

18:49.709 --> 18:54.834
to get out of this dumb

18:49.709 --> 18:54.834
family dinner. One sec.

18:54.875 --> 18:58.834
- Ya know what? If you guys

18:54.875 --> 18:58.834
don't like my dinner,

18:58.875 --> 19:00.834
then dinner is over!

19:12.041 --> 19:14.375
- I found a way.

19:17.709 --> 19:20.291
So, you sure this

19:17.709 --> 19:20.291
thing is gonna fix

19:20.333 --> 19:22.333
my fire-laughing problem?

19:22.375 --> 19:24.291
- Eh, pretty sure.

19:26.125 --> 19:28.417
- But I won't be

19:26.125 --> 19:28.417
indestructible anymore?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.583
- We don't know.

19:31.625 --> 19:35.917
- Well then,

19:31.625 --> 19:35.917
before I do this, Ray?

19:35.959 --> 19:38.458
- Yeah Kid?

19:38.500 --> 19:42.417
- One time? Just in case

19:38.500 --> 19:42.417
it's my last chance?

19:46.250 --> 19:47.750
- Sure Kid.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.542
- Ew, no! What--what

19:49.625 --> 19:51.542
are ya doin', man?!

19:51.583 --> 19:53.750
- What? You tapped your cheek!

19:53.792 --> 19:58.250
- I didn't want you to kiss it!

19:53.792 --> 19:58.250
I wanted you to punch it!

19:58.291 --> 20:00.166
While I'm still

19:58.291 --> 20:00.166
indestructible!

20:00.208 --> 20:01.750
- Oh...Okay...Hehe...

20:04.834 --> 20:06.125
- I'm okay.

20:06.166 --> 20:08.208
- Ah, classic...

20:08.250 --> 20:10.000
- All right. Let's do this.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.834
- Googles on.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.667
- Wait, wait...

20:13.583 --> 20:15.667
Do I get goggles?

20:15.709 --> 20:17.500
- Eh, we only have three pair.

20:20.125 --> 20:23.458
- Voosh, veek, veezle!

20:43.834 --> 20:45.583
- Oog-Schtoomp!

20:52.625 --> 20:57.125
- Woo! That felt awesome!

20:57.166 --> 20:58.959
- Henry, are you all right?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.917
- Yeah, I think so.

21:00.959 --> 21:03.417
- Okay, how do we make him

21:00.959 --> 21:03.417
laugh, to see if fire comes out?

21:03.458 --> 21:06.959
- Ooh! Ray! Do your impression

21:03.458 --> 21:06.959
of Schwoz taking a shower.

21:07.000 --> 21:08.625
- Aw, yeah...

21:08.667 --> 21:10.458
- Good idea,

21:08.667 --> 21:10.458
that'll make Henry laugh.

21:12.375 --> 21:15.125
Ah, I am Schwoz,

21:12.375 --> 21:15.125
I am Schwoz,

21:15.166 --> 21:16.458
dirty, dirty Schwoz!

21:16.500 --> 21:18.333
Ooh, hello Mister Soap!

21:18.375 --> 21:20.542
You're going on

21:18.375 --> 21:20.542
a disgusting adventure!

21:20.583 --> 21:23.500
Ah, ah, get in my

21:20.583 --> 21:23.500
belly button.

21:23.542 --> 21:25.500
Ah, ah...

21:31.625 --> 21:34.417
- It worked!

21:31.625 --> 21:34.417
I laughed and no fire!

21:34.458 --> 21:36.542
- Yeah! Awesome!

21:36.583 --> 21:38.750
Ooh, wait wait!

21:36.583 --> 21:38.750
- What's up? What?

21:38.792 --> 21:41.083
- We don't know if Henry's

21:38.792 --> 21:41.083
still indestructible or not.

21:41.125 --> 21:42.542
- Oh...

21:47.625 --> 21:51.542
- He's back to normal!

22:00.208 --> 22:03.792
[ music ]

22:23.583 --> 22:24.625
[ oven bell ]

22:24.667 --> 22:26.083
- Mmm...
