00:14.472 --> 00:17.017
<i>I always dreamed</i>
<i>of living an epic high school life.</i>

00:17.100 --> 00:19.519
<i>But even as a senior,</i>
<i>I was hiding in the shadows.</i>

00:19.602 --> 00:22.856
<i>Until one fateful night.</i>

00:24.774 --> 00:27.235
<i>See those shoes under the moose?</i>

00:27.777 --> 00:29.070
<i>They're mine.</i>

00:29.154 --> 00:30.196
<i>You do the math.</i>

00:31.031 --> 00:32.574
<i>Okay, I'll do it for you.</i>

00:32.657 --> 00:33.867
<i>I'm dead.</i>

00:34.492 --> 00:35.326
<i>Ish.</i>

01:52.362 --> 01:53.613
It's clear. Go.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.283
Okay, now.

01:59.327 --> 02:03.373
I can't believe we have two months
of high school left. KMNBMIASG.

02:03.456 --> 02:07.460
Erika, maybe it's time you try Wellbutrin.
Give your anxiety a little vacay.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.421
-What's up with everyone wearing green?
-Irish inclusion.

02:12.340 --> 02:13.633
Hi. Sorry. Sorry.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.594
I wish they could just
drone drop our diplomas

02:16.678 --> 02:18.930
so we could skip
all this end of high school bullshit.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.724
-Hard pass on all of it.
-What, even prom?

02:28.815 --> 02:30.984
Especially prom. I'm not going.

02:31.067 --> 02:34.696
Come on. Prom is the one thing
I wanna do before we graduate.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.824
Prom is going to be
the best night of my life.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.243
Have fun! Send pics.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.998
Okay. Okay. Let's just put a pin in that.
Move on to something smaller.

02:45.081 --> 02:47.125
What if we… Crazy idea.
You can totally hate it.

02:47.208 --> 02:50.378
It's not gonna hurt my feelings
because I am on Lexapro.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.715
…go to a regular party.

02:54.883 --> 02:57.093
I heard there's gonna be one this weekend.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.597
Yeah. I saw that over Ashley's shoulder
on the senior text chain.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.100
Please hold. There's a senior text chain
and we're not on it?

03:04.184 --> 03:07.312
I'm glad we're not on it. I don't wanna
see alerts about shit I don't wanna do.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.064
Hey! Mo! Is there a senior text chain?

03:10.148 --> 03:11.149
Looking at it.

03:13.067 --> 03:13.902
Give.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.863
Oh my God. This is not acceptable.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.157
Erika, we… We are seniors.

03:19.657 --> 03:21.701
Oh my God.
Look at all this shit we missed.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.454
We missed kickbacks,
ragers, daygers, a hoedown,

03:24.537 --> 03:27.540
and the lowdown on why everyone
is wearing green. Erika, It's spirit week.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.877
-We didn't miss anything. It's all dumb.
-Your subconscious would beg to differ.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.087
You're realizing
we're about to leave high school,

03:33.171 --> 03:35.548
and all we have to show for it
is our education.

03:36.674 --> 03:38.551
-We're going to Jake's party.
-Which Jake?

03:38.635 --> 03:40.511
-The tall one.
-They're all tall.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.640
-The one who set himself on fire.
-Jake W? So no.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.975
But Jake C will def be there.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.940
All three Jakes
have RSVP'd "Yes" or "Yo,"

03:52.023 --> 03:53.358
depending on the Jake.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.653
I'm adding our names to the text chain.

03:57.695 --> 03:58.947
I'll think about it.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.783
Listen. Hey.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.034
I… I know…

04:03.701 --> 04:06.663
I know I am beating a dead horse
with a live Jake,

04:06.746 --> 04:09.082
but everyone and every Jake
is going to be there.

04:09.165 --> 04:11.167
It's the second to last Saturday
of spring break.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.835
There are only two Saturdays.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.630
Which is why we have to go.
It's our last chance to get a prom date.

04:15.713 --> 04:19.467
Gia, we are this close to finishing high
school without getting dragged on social.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.261
We have been so lucky.

04:21.344 --> 04:25.056
Minus freshman orientation,
we've had no epic fails.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.934
Or epic wins.
Can't we just take one low-key chance?

04:28.017 --> 04:30.895
Let's just get through the rest
of the year so we leave on a clean slate.

04:30.979 --> 04:32.814
Yeah, so clean there's no trace of us.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.941
Great. I will take that
over being infamous.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.318
-Like who?
-The mother of all mothers.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.070
Alyssa Seranie.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.583
Crazy town. She didn't even know
she was preggo.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.085
That only validates my argument

04:54.168 --> 04:57.588
that life is better out of the hot tub
and under the radar, period.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.466
Who knows if it's true.
Those are just wild-ass rumors.

05:00.550 --> 05:03.678
-There were witnesses.
-But not us. We witnessed nothing.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.724
-Meet you at yearbook after school.
-Yearbook?

05:07.807 --> 05:10.393
Yeah. We're getting a sneak peek
before it goes to the printers.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.186
Alyssa's the yearbook editor.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.063
I babysat her hot-tub baby.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.400
Take all the time you want.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.741
-It's amazing!
-Ah!

05:24.824 --> 05:26.868
Yay! Okay. All right, let's find yours.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.328
Erika Vu, where are you?

05:28.411 --> 05:30.204
Shit. They misspelled my name.
Keep looking.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.999
No, it's fine. Here. It's here.

05:35.543 --> 05:37.462
No!

05:38.504 --> 05:39.881
It's the schedule!

05:39.964 --> 05:44.260
Now ID's and then club sign-ups.
We're so gonna make high school our Bs.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.681
I am so sorry.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.808
-Oh my God, Riley!

05:50.892 --> 05:52.935
-Your face is broken.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.980
She just had a summer of transformation,
and you ruined her.

05:59.734 --> 06:01.986
I am so sorry.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.906
You're a joke.
I'll never forget what you did to me.

06:04.989 --> 06:06.240
It was an accident.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.409
Little advice.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.203
Make yourself invisible,

06:10.286 --> 06:11.704
or I'll do it for you.

06:16.292 --> 06:18.753
-Next.
-Erika, let it go.

06:18.836 --> 06:20.338
It wasn't your fault.

06:20.421 --> 06:21.798
Oh, hey, uh,

06:22.298 --> 06:25.385
your unicorn has a bloody horn.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.182
-Oh, you're such…
-Jake.

06:31.265 --> 06:33.559
I'm Jake. And you are?

06:34.185 --> 06:35.395
Hello.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.772
-Helen.
-Helen who?

06:37.855 --> 06:40.400
-Who?
-Yeah, that's her name. Helen Who.

06:41.359 --> 06:42.860
-Chin down, Helen.
-Who?

06:42.944 --> 06:44.570
Yeah, I got it. Chin down.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.743
Every year I have corrected my name,

06:50.827 --> 06:53.037
and every year they ignore me.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.706
Four years at this school,
and I am still Helen Who.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.584
-I may as well be dead.
-No… No, it's a typo. People know you.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.505
Erika Vu? Isn't she that girl
who made out with Brett on the Internet?

07:02.588 --> 07:05.174
No, no, no, no. She's the kid
who got spanked on Zoom.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.926
No, I know Erika Vu.

07:07.009 --> 07:10.304
She's that unhinged girl who gave Riley
a beatdown during ninth grade orientation

07:10.388 --> 07:11.681
and broke her face.

07:12.682 --> 07:13.724
No, wait.

07:14.475 --> 07:15.685
That was Helen Who.

07:16.185 --> 07:19.147
-Are you done?
-Completely done and over.

07:21.065 --> 07:23.401
Oh my God. What if college plays out
like high school

07:23.484 --> 07:24.819
and life plays out like college,

07:24.902 --> 07:28.197
and I die without anyone knowing who I am
or even remembering my name?

07:28.281 --> 07:30.116
Listen to this teenage mom.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.871
You can do and be
anything that you wanna be.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.540
You have so much potential,
and I promise you,

07:37.623 --> 07:41.210
when you leave this earth,
people will remember you, Helen.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.757
Erika!

07:46.841 --> 07:49.469
No one even knows my real name,
and it's my fault.

07:49.552 --> 07:53.681
I let it happen. I let Riley paralyze me,
and I've been paralyzed ever since.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.892
I had such big plans for high school,

07:55.975 --> 07:58.978
but instead I've been
hiding in the shadows because it is safe.

07:59.061 --> 08:01.481
It's better to be unseen than to be seen.

08:04.275 --> 08:07.695
Maybe this is who I am.
Maybe I will always be Helen Who.

08:07.778 --> 08:12.241
You will not. You are Erika Vu, bitch.
A girl with big hopes and dreams.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.577
I am not that girl anymore.
I use tampons now.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.038
And there's no time anyway.
High school is over.

08:17.121 --> 08:19.957
It's not over. This is our LCTMSEM.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.053
You're right.

08:32.595 --> 08:34.722
There is still time to live,

08:34.805 --> 08:36.474
to leave a legacy,

08:36.557 --> 08:38.768
to reach around for the stars.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.646
We have two months left
for someone besides you to know my name.

08:41.729 --> 08:43.981
Helen Who must die

08:44.065 --> 08:46.234
so Erika Vu can live.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.362
And she starts
by going to that effing party.

08:49.987 --> 08:50.988
Yes!

08:51.072 --> 08:51.948
Okay.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.494
Yep. Okay.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.289
One, two, three.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.232
Oh wow. We look…

09:26.899 --> 09:27.733
Yep.

09:28.609 --> 09:29.485
Do-over.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.654
-Okay, yeah.
-All right. Okay.

09:31.737 --> 09:32.822
Go on. It's okay.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.791
We are so ready for this party.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.962
Almost. So I got this for us
for graduation,

09:48.045 --> 09:50.423
but seems like now might be a better time.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.175
-Matching necklaces!

09:53.259 --> 09:55.011
I love them!

09:55.094 --> 09:57.430
-Well, now we're ready.
-Couldn't be readier.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.348
You girls look hot.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.185
It's a weird thing to say, Dad.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.147
But thanks.

10:06.230 --> 10:09.567
-Oh, and, Gia, I have a book for your mom.
-Mm-mm. You can hold on to it.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.278
My mom's on a teaching sabbatical
in Europe for the next few months.

10:12.361 --> 10:16.365
-Oh, and she's leaving you all alone?
-I'm 18. Plus, I have RING.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.618
-Oh.
-So what's on the agenda for tonight?

10:18.701 --> 10:21.370
Shall we vacate the den
so you can watch the big TV?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.956
Um, no. Actually, we're going to a party.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.505
-It's finally happening!
-Thank God!

10:31.589 --> 10:34.508
We've been waiting for this day.
Here, take some money.

10:34.592 --> 10:36.344
Take my car. It's fancier.

10:36.427 --> 10:37.303
Or don't.

10:37.386 --> 10:41.932
Right. You know, I could pick you up
and drop you off, so you can drink.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.728
Wanna pregame?

10:53.319 --> 10:55.029
Are we supposed to just walk in?

11:03.579 --> 11:04.914
Did we get bad intel?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.416
Or is this a setup to lure us here

11:07.500 --> 11:10.628
so they can take us to a warehouse,
where we get hooked on drugs

11:10.711 --> 11:14.048
and we agree to be sex trafficked just so
we can get our hands on that brown sugar?

11:16.842 --> 11:19.095
Or maybe everyone's hanging out
somewhere else.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.152
-We heard there's a party here.
-Yeah, there is.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.489
-The text chain says it starts at nine.
-Yeah, it does.

11:39.615 --> 11:40.825
It's nine right now.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.952
Yeah.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.954
Okay.

11:46.914 --> 11:49.458
-Wait, what?
-Nine means 10:30.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.918
We'll come back later.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.922
Or you could put out
the red cups and snacks.

11:55.881 --> 11:57.133
If you don't mind.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.472
I'm gonna get back to my shower. Cool?

12:03.973 --> 12:05.057
Cool.

12:11.981 --> 12:12.857
Ugh.

12:12.940 --> 12:16.277
-What are you making?
-Our signature drink, the stiletto.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.908
-Ooh. Double tap on the stiletto.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.997
It's 10:29. Guess no one else is coming.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.751
Well, if we leave now, we can watch
<i>The Great Pottery Throw Down.</i>

12:40.134 --> 12:41.218
10:30.

12:46.932 --> 12:50.603
Check us out. Chilling at a party,
in the middle of the action,

12:50.686 --> 12:52.938
drinking stilettos like they are LaCroix.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.690
TBVH, I was so nervous before,

12:54.774 --> 12:57.193
but now that I'm here,
I feel so comfortable.

12:57.276 --> 13:00.362
One, we're sitting
in these supes padded club chairs.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.364
And two, we've only
had to talk to each other.

13:02.448 --> 13:05.075
I'm making a video
for the senior time capsule.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.660
Do you go to Parkway?

13:06.744 --> 13:08.788
-I'm your lab partner.
-Come on.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.040
Anything you wanna say
to your future selves?

13:11.123 --> 13:13.542
-Hi, future selves.
-Yeah. This party is the…

13:15.085 --> 13:16.796
-Yeah, okay.
-That was so fun.

13:16.879 --> 13:18.047
Okay, are you ready to go?

13:18.130 --> 13:20.716
No. We are not leaving
until we've had some real fun.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.301
-We have.
-Erika.

13:22.384 --> 13:25.721
We can't leave a legacy
by sitting on the sidelines.

13:25.805 --> 13:29.016
-We need to interact, intermingle.
-This was a bad idea.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.143
They don't need to know us.
They're all lame.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.646
Yeah, lame. I said it.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.105
Especially Riley.

13:36.106 --> 13:39.401
She's a fake salty giraffe who eats all
the good leaves from the top of the tree,

13:39.485 --> 13:42.029
and Jake C is her little simp bitch

13:42.112 --> 13:45.825
who just stays in a shitty relationship
because he's too afraid to be alone.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.702
And Keisha, she pretends to be a skater,

13:48.786 --> 13:50.871
but those wheels
have never touched pavement.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.833
And Lea, she hates Riley,
but she kisses her ass

13:53.916 --> 13:56.836
because she doesn't want to go back
to slumming it with the band freaks.

13:57.586 --> 13:58.546
And Dice.

13:59.046 --> 14:02.383
I'm pretty sure he's had sex
with both of his stepsisters.

14:02.466 --> 14:03.759
Is the diss fest over?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.011
-Yes. I'm sorry.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.933
I don't know any of these people,
but I feel like they don't wanna know me.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.768
I didn't mean it.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.353
Yo! Everybody!

14:14.436 --> 14:17.982
It's dance party time!

14:21.235 --> 14:22.319
No excuses.

14:22.403 --> 14:24.905
This is our song.
This is our song. We have to dance.

14:25.489 --> 14:27.575
One dance and then we can leave.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.924
Hey. Hey, we can go. We can go.
I will call your dad.

14:45.175 --> 14:46.135
Bye, Helen.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.388
Hey, Dr. Vu. Yeah. Yeah, we're…

14:50.055 --> 14:51.140
Good night, Roger.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.350
We are not leaving.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.311
We came here to take risks,

14:55.394 --> 14:57.771
to live fearlessly, to make keg stands.

14:57.855 --> 14:59.815
I am Erika Vu,

14:59.899 --> 15:02.276
and Erika Vu knows how to party.

15:02.359 --> 15:03.611
So from now on,

15:03.694 --> 15:06.530
we say yes to everything.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.908
-Everything?
-Everything!

15:10.743 --> 15:12.661
-You guys locked out?
-Yes!

15:12.745 --> 15:13.829
You wanna dance?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.039
Yes!

15:15.122 --> 15:17.333
-You wanna do a shot?
-Yes!

15:17.416 --> 15:19.460
-You guys want tattoos?
-Yes!

15:19.543 --> 15:21.962
-Jump in the pool in our underwear?
-Yes!

15:23.297 --> 15:24.673
Wanna have a threesome?

15:26.050 --> 15:26.884
No.

15:28.969 --> 15:31.221
Do you feel drunk? I don't.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.140
Not at all. But I gotta pee.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.142
My red cup is on empty.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.228
Meet you here in five to 50,
depending on the bathroom line.

15:41.857 --> 15:43.067
-Edible?
-Yes.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.451
I wouldn't drink that.

15:54.578 --> 15:56.080
Then what would you recommend?

15:57.373 --> 15:58.832
Watch and learn, sir.

16:11.804 --> 16:12.930
Mmm.

16:13.013 --> 16:15.391
Okay. Tastes like a Shirley Temple.

16:16.016 --> 16:19.144
-What's the alcohol component?
-Grenadine. Lots of it.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.146
Grenadine is not alcohol.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.531
Still good.

16:30.614 --> 16:31.865
Wow. Wait, what's it called?

16:32.825 --> 16:33.867
The Ambassador.

16:34.576 --> 16:36.245
Well, 'cause when Shirley Temple grew up,

16:36.328 --> 16:38.956
she became the UN Ambassador
for Ghana and Czech Republic--

16:39.039 --> 16:41.417
-Shirley Temple was a real person? No!

16:41.500 --> 16:42.334
Now you're screwed.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.754
Because whenever I need a refill,
I'm just gonna have to track you down.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.216
No, don't do that.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.011
I mean, do. <i>Do</i> do it.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.390
-I'm Jake C.
-And I am not Helen Who.

16:57.599 --> 16:58.684
Oh, yeah, I know.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.269
You're Erika.

17:04.815 --> 17:07.234
Oh my God. He knows my name.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.946
I'm… I'm dying. I'm dead. I'm a ghost.

17:11.030 --> 17:12.656
-Oh God. Shit.

17:15.284 --> 17:17.536
-Shit.
-Yo! Do you pong?

17:17.619 --> 17:18.871
Yes!

17:18.954 --> 17:20.998
Hey, yo! I got one. With me.

17:27.421 --> 17:30.174
Bro! Come on. Look, noobs. You're up.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.216
It's Erika.

17:36.889 --> 17:37.848
-What?

17:46.065 --> 17:47.941
All right, look out. Move.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.194
Come on. What you got?

17:59.161 --> 18:00.996
Erika, Erika!

18:01.080 --> 18:02.206
Erika!

18:02.289 --> 18:04.083
Erika, Erika!

18:06.919 --> 18:08.670
Why are you heckling Helen?

18:10.005 --> 18:12.174
We're cheering. Erika's a badass.

18:12.841 --> 18:14.093
Erika!

18:19.556 --> 18:21.517
Ignore me. I have a UTI.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.149
Uh… eh…

18:30.526 --> 18:33.737
Yeah. We should find, like,
another bathroom or plan or something.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.155
This might take a while.

19:01.098 --> 19:05.060
Give it up for the winner!

19:18.991 --> 19:21.243
-So you just didn't have to pee at all?
-No.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.912
But these magnetic eyelashes are tricky,
and I need good light.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.957
Riley, all those people out there,
they really did have to pee.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.376
Are you even listening?

19:31.003 --> 19:31.837
All right.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.176
Go in. She's just doing her makeup.

19:37.259 --> 19:41.138
-Jake! Why are you walking away from me?
-I'm tired of you not listening to me.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.598
Babe, I heard you. You're annoyed.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.975
I didn't say I was annoyed,
but, know what? I am.

19:45.058 --> 19:47.644
When you walk away from me like that,
it makes me think we're done.

19:47.728 --> 19:50.480
We are. You know,
I'm tired of the drama, Riley.

19:50.564 --> 19:53.358
Okay. If that's what you want.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.861
I do. And, you know what?
No getting back together,

19:55.944 --> 19:57.863
like… last weekend,

19:57.946 --> 20:00.657
and Monday, and Wednesday
before and after third period.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.034
Fine.

20:02.618 --> 20:03.952
We're broken up for good.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.803
Erika!

20:22.346 --> 20:25.140
Gia! Look, I'm dancing on a table!

20:25.224 --> 20:27.100
And I just peed in a fake plant!

20:27.184 --> 20:30.145
Erika. I need a refill.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.651
Hey.

20:37.194 --> 20:38.570
Are you going to prom?

20:40.781 --> 20:41.907
Agh.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.868
My secret stash. It's gone.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.206
-Could really use a drink right now.
-What's wrong?

20:49.289 --> 20:51.667
You don't seem like your usual chill self.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.669
My usual self?

20:53.752 --> 20:57.798
Uh… from the kitchen earlier.
That self. You don't seem like that.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.884
Right. Well, you know what?
That was before Riley and I broke up.

21:00.968 --> 21:04.763
For real. You know, we split up
over, like, 36 times this year.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.682
And I don't know why I kept going back.

21:06.765 --> 21:11.019
You know, I guess I just thought
that maybe she'd, like, change,

21:11.103 --> 21:14.564
but, you know, the truth is,
she's just, like, always going to be a…

21:14.648 --> 21:16.024
A bitch.

21:16.900 --> 21:19.111
Just interpreting from your face.

21:21.029 --> 21:24.116
You know, maybe it's time
to try something new.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.161
To be with someone more like…

21:28.662 --> 21:29.579
Like…

21:31.456 --> 21:32.624
You.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.878
There's no secret stash, is there?

21:36.962 --> 21:38.630
Oh, no. No, no. There is.

21:39.381 --> 21:40.632
There definitely is.

21:41.883 --> 21:42.843
Where?

21:47.764 --> 21:49.933
I didn't think to look there.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.566
I hate to break this up…
I mean, I really hate to break this up…

21:57.649 --> 21:59.484
Go, go, go!

22:09.077 --> 22:11.538
Erika. You okay?

22:11.621 --> 22:13.040
Much better now. Yeah.

22:13.623 --> 22:15.625
I'm sorry.
Look, I gotta help Jake M,

22:15.709 --> 22:18.503
who's, like, so lit
he's taking a bath upstairs right now.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.672
Can I have your number,

22:20.756 --> 22:23.258
so we can… finish what we started?

22:23.342 --> 22:24.301
Yeah, yeah.

22:30.682 --> 22:32.351
Now I can find you anywhere.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.394
Can't wait to be found.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.077
He already followed me
on IG and TikTok.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.163
Relationships are temporary,
but follows are basically forever.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.625
Thank you for pushing me
to live my best life, bestie.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.795
No, "bestie" is not a strong enough word.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.630
You are my sister.

23:01.713 --> 23:04.508
Well, now we know
what kind of drunk you are. Sappy.

23:05.926 --> 23:09.388
I don't wanna get ahead of myself,
but since we're saying yes to everything,

23:09.971 --> 23:13.558
how about prom?
I mean, I'm already going with Jake W.

23:14.643 --> 23:17.062
He said yes, and you should too.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.648
Yes! I'm gonna ask Jake C.

23:19.731 --> 23:21.066
Ah! We're going to prom!

23:21.149 --> 23:23.985
We are! I can't believe
we've waited so long to start living.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.737
We're young. Our lives are just beginning.

23:25.821 --> 23:27.489
Yes. And we're gonna be remembered.

23:27.572 --> 23:31.034
From now on, let's promise
to live our lives without giving any fu…

23:42.879 --> 23:45.382
Train wreck central. I feel like ass.

23:45.465 --> 23:46.299
You?

23:46.383 --> 23:50.679
<i>I'm not gonna lie. I'm a little off.</i>
<i>What even happened last night?</i>

23:50.762 --> 23:52.556
<i>ITHTRMON.</i>

23:53.932 --> 23:55.016
Epicness.

23:56.059 --> 23:58.437
And I also have the hangover to prove it.

23:58.520 --> 24:01.022
-Wait. When did you get home?
<i>-Don't know.</i>

24:02.399 --> 24:03.775
<i>Hey. Uh, where's your necklace?</i>

24:06.153 --> 24:06.987
No.

24:07.070 --> 24:10.532
<i>Don't panic. We'll retrace our steps.</i>
<i>Meet by the woods in 20.</i>

24:15.495 --> 24:17.914
I know it was on at Jake W's house
'cause I got throw up on it.

24:17.998 --> 24:20.417
So it must be around here.

24:50.530 --> 24:53.283
Those are my shoes.
Why is a dead girl wearing my shoes?
