Oh, just eat one already!

00:59.927 --> 01:02.761
There's only ever
one chip worth eating.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.563
Besides, if this is
too boring,

01:04.565 --> 01:07.166
you could be practicing
your magic.

01:07.168 --> 01:08.734
Fine!

01:08.736 --> 01:11.570
What are we
learning today?

01:11.572 --> 01:13.572
Why don't you pick one?
Pick anything.

01:13.574 --> 01:15.574
And my mom would
be cool with that?

01:15.576 --> 01:18.911
Yes, there's a lot I do
that your mom isn't cool with.

01:18.913 --> 01:22.915
Well, how cool would she be
with this?

01:22.917 --> 01:24.750
( evil laughter )

01:24.752 --> 01:26.385
The table of contents?

01:26.387 --> 01:28.020
A thrilling choice.

01:28.022 --> 01:30.722
Why is that
in the middle?

01:30.724 --> 01:33.192
- Ehhh?
- Pedestrian.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.527
- Ehh?
- Boring.
- ( barks )

01:35.529 --> 01:39.765
( laughs )
The perfect chip.

01:39.767 --> 01:42.301
What's this?!

01:44.604 --> 01:46.805
- Oh, no, no.
- Hey, you said anything.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.307
It's the most dangerous
chapter in the book.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.608
It shouldn't even
be in there.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.777
Your mom would
totally freak out.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.812
Okay, okay,
you sold me.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.247
I wanna read that.

01:55.249 --> 01:56.315
Oh, I don't
know, Star.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.917
It could taint you.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.786
Perfect chip!

02:00.788 --> 02:03.889
Unlock it.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.457
Hostage-taking.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.792
Classic Butterfly.

02:06.794 --> 02:09.795
Unlock it or else.

02:09.797 --> 02:13.499
- You wouldn't.
- Uh-uh-uh.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.234
Okay, okay.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.769
Chip.
( crunching loudly )

02:17.771 --> 02:19.238
Okay, so...

02:19.240 --> 02:22.007
- Yes, yes, but, um...
- Hey!

02:22.009 --> 02:24.109
This wasn't the deal.

02:24.111 --> 02:26.478
Oh, well, I'm so sorry.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.113
But you're without
your bargaining chip.

02:28.115 --> 02:30.349
Fine. I am standing here.
Open it.

02:37.323 --> 02:40.692
Now, I'm going to show you,
for a split second.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.629
( loud buzzing )

02:43.631 --> 02:47.666
Bureaucracy of Magic.
Yes, this is he.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.668
- Tell 'em you're busy.
- Kind of a bad time.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.504
- Tell 'em you're busy.
- Are you listening to me?

02:52.506 --> 02:54.439
- You're busy right now.
- This is not a good time.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.675
This is the worst time.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.110
- Star, I'll be right back.
- Just hang up.

02:58.112 --> 03:00.445
Don't turn the page.

03:00.447 --> 03:02.214
( shrieking )

03:02.216 --> 03:04.116
Uh, Glossaryck?

03:11.324 --> 03:13.992
( shrieking )

03:13.994 --> 03:16.295
Oh, hi, Mr. Glossaryck.
Sir?

03:16.297 --> 03:18.564
Sean. Oh.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.033
Sorry. The transporter's
on the fritz today.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.168
But there's free muffins
in the lobby.

03:23.170 --> 03:24.970
Look, Sean, I was
in the middle of something,

03:24.972 --> 03:28.574
and it was of
ultra cosmic importance.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.142
Yeah, but you see,

03:30.144 --> 03:34.479
the Magic High Commission
wants to see you, too, and...

03:34.481 --> 03:39.051
( laughing )

03:39.053 --> 03:40.986
Uh, is everything
all right?

03:40.988 --> 03:42.821
I don't know.
Is everything all right?

03:42.823 --> 03:45.490
Did you get on the right flight?
Are you running late?

03:45.492 --> 03:47.059
Are you cracked,
are you confused?

03:47.061 --> 03:50.162
Are you mad?
( blubbering )

03:50.164 --> 03:52.664
Oh, Mr. Glossaryck,
you're so crazy.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.901
But you still have
to go up and see
the Magic High Commission.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.337
Hand me your radio.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.539
( loud blaring sound )

04:00.541 --> 04:02.874
Radio's on the fritz, too.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.743
You're gonna
have to go up.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.180
Very well.

04:08.182 --> 04:11.350
Great. Up the elevator,
all the way to the top.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.952
Wait, wait, wait.
No magic in the building.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.787
You'll have to walk.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.422
Fine.

04:18.858 --> 04:19.992
Have a magical day.

04:21.861 --> 04:23.762
Glossaryck.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.101
Glossaryck, Glossaryck,
Glossaryck.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.802
He is not waking up.

04:30.804 --> 04:33.005
Time to call Mom.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.415
Uh, never mind.

04:43.417 --> 04:47.319
Please step through
the magical detection machine.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.621
Oh, come on.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.157
Are you carrying any articles
of magic, sorcery,

04:52.159 --> 04:54.326
or occult objects
of a mystical nature?

04:54.328 --> 04:57.963
Uh... no.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.598
Just step this way, please.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.800
- ( beeps )
- Thank you.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.769
Okay, Mr. Glossaryck.
Your turn.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.071
( alarm blaring )

05:06.073 --> 05:08.106
Wait. Hold on.
Are you kidding?

05:08.108 --> 05:10.108
That other guy
just walked right through.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.443
Technology, right?

05:11.445 --> 05:14.112
I miss
the simpler days.

05:14.114 --> 05:15.814
I think
we're done here.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.816
- Have a magical...
- ( alarm sounds )

05:17.818 --> 05:19.818
Sean, work with me, please.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.653
Cosmic ultra importance.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.821
( beeps )

05:22.823 --> 05:25.457
( alarms sounding )

05:25.459 --> 05:27.526
That stays with me.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.928
Hello. Hold the elevator.

05:32.665 --> 05:35.033
Oh, hey, Mr. Glossaryck.
Which floor?

05:35.035 --> 05:36.868
We've done this.
Top floor.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.813
Uh, what's going on?
The elevator's not moving.

05:47.815 --> 05:50.048
Uh, elevator's
on the fritz, too.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.217
Sorry.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.286
But there's muffins
in the lobby.

05:54.288 --> 05:55.721
Which part of "cosmic
ultra importance"

05:55.723 --> 05:57.055
do you not understand?

05:57.057 --> 05:58.957
( bell dings )

05:58.959 --> 06:01.059
Now we have to stop on
every floor.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.028
( maniacal laughter )

06:03.030 --> 06:05.564
Sean. Stairs.

06:10.169 --> 06:11.436
( exhausted sigh )

06:14.974 --> 06:18.310
( panting )

06:18.312 --> 06:21.079
Hey, Star, check it out.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.315
I'm getting my first
chest hair.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.717
It's pretty small,
but if you look at it

06:25.719 --> 06:26.985
in just the right light...

06:26.987 --> 06:29.154
Uh, Glossaryck?

06:29.156 --> 06:30.522
What's up with him?

06:30.524 --> 06:31.923
He's on the fritz.

06:31.925 --> 06:33.592
Wait a sec.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.061
Are you doing something
you're not supposed to?

06:36.063 --> 06:38.029
Glossaryck said
not to turn the page.

06:38.031 --> 06:43.368
But he didn't say
you couldn't.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.438
( panting and muttering )

06:56.082 --> 06:59.017
Stairs are
on the fritz, too.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.086
( angry groaning )

07:01.088 --> 07:03.288
Now, now,
Mr. Glossaryck.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.323
No magic in the building.

07:32.151 --> 07:34.986
You're probably wondering
why you're here.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.890
Children, the only thing
I wonder

07:38.892 --> 07:41.560
is why you waste my time.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.962
Don't call me children.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.797
You're the children.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.133
I've got chest diamonds
bigger than you.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.301
Rhombulus.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.238
Rhombulus, you still mad
about my last visit?

08:02.081 --> 08:04.082
( bleating )

08:05.318 --> 08:07.652
Excuse me, sorry.
Don't mean to be rude.

08:07.654 --> 08:09.521
Getting stronger, though,
huh? That's good.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.756
You always do this!

08:23.035 --> 08:26.738
So you bring me here
while I'm at work.

08:29.442 --> 08:32.544
Doing my job.

08:34.113 --> 08:36.114
Yes, Glossaryck.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.852
That's exactly what
we're here to talk about.

08:40.854 --> 08:43.388
My liege.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.663
The commission
has discovered a problem.

08:51.665 --> 08:53.365
Something somewhere
is sapping the power of magic

08:53.367 --> 08:55.166
from the universe.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.369
Yes, that would explain
the fritz.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.371
That's what I've
been saying.

08:59.373 --> 09:01.172
Hey, the time-out corner
is not on the fritz.

09:01.174 --> 09:03.909
Stupid Glossaryck.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.477
Stupid time out.

09:05.479 --> 09:08.146
Omnitraxus has been
searching for the leak's cause.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.148
Omnitraxus, what have
you learned?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.984
- ( muffled speaking )
- Hello!

09:12.986 --> 09:14.052
Omni?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.487
Can you hear me?

09:15.489 --> 09:18.189
- Check the inputs.
- You out.

09:18.191 --> 09:21.326
Yeah, whatever.
I'll crystallize myself.

09:21.328 --> 09:23.194
Would you miss me? No.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.764
( bleating )

09:25.766 --> 09:27.933
Whatever's causing it,

09:27.935 --> 09:30.201
I want everyone
to be on their toes.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.570
Especially Star.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.338
I need you to accelerate
her training.

09:33.340 --> 09:35.340
Yeah... no.

09:35.342 --> 09:37.375
Why all the riddles?

09:37.377 --> 09:40.078
You were always very direct
when you were training me.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.880
Well, it finally happened.

09:41.882 --> 09:46.217
Every queen wants to tell me
how to do my job.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.086
"My training was different."

09:48.088 --> 09:50.355
You know what
Glossaryck hears?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.357
Me-me-me-me-me!

09:52.359 --> 09:54.192
"I'm going to pull my mentor
away from his job

09:54.194 --> 09:56.127
so I can be in
the spotlight again."

09:56.129 --> 09:58.296
The only Butterfly
to leave me be

09:58.298 --> 10:01.933
was your great-great-great
great-great-great-great
great-grandmother,

10:01.935 --> 10:03.935
Eclipsa,
the queen of darkness,

10:03.937 --> 10:06.705
whose chapter, coincidentally,
you left Star alone with

10:06.707 --> 10:09.374
when you pulled me into
this wonderland of red tape.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.943
<i>Turn the page,</i>
<i>turn the page!</i>

10:11.945 --> 10:13.979
<i>I'm gonna turn</i>
<i>the page.</i>

10:13.981 --> 10:15.647
Turn the page, Marco!

10:15.649 --> 10:17.649
( anguished bleating )

10:17.651 --> 10:20.452
You all did this because
you don't trust me,

10:20.454 --> 10:22.120
and what's worse,
you don't trust Star.

10:22.122 --> 10:25.924
My queen. My queen,
your training was different

10:25.926 --> 10:27.759
because Star is different.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.928
You have to have faith in her
to make choices

10:29.930 --> 10:31.763
that are best for her.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.164
And my job

10:33.166 --> 10:37.202
is to train Star
to be a queen.

10:41.907 --> 10:43.642
Oh!

10:43.644 --> 10:45.844
- So?
- Yeah.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.445
You read the whole thing?

10:47.447 --> 10:48.747
Yeah.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.482
And?

10:50.484 --> 10:52.450
It wasn't all that.
I mean, I get it.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.285
Power of darkness,
forces of evil,

10:54.287 --> 10:56.588
eternal suffering,
blah, blah, blah.

10:56.590 --> 10:59.658
But honestly, didn't
really affect me that much.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.259
- Just wasn't my thing.
- Yes!

11:01.261 --> 11:03.194
But Marco,
on the other hand.
Yikes.

11:05.631 --> 11:08.199
( evil muttering )

11:08.201 --> 11:11.202
Luckily, there's
a spell
to fix that.

11:14.607 --> 11:17.008
Oh, Minnesota.
Fancy.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.211
Okay, you got this.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.513
Today is the day.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.947
- Hey, Marco.
- ( gasps )

11:22.949 --> 11:25.383
Today is the day
for what?

11:25.385 --> 11:27.552
Oh, uh...

11:27.554 --> 11:29.788
Today is the day...

11:29.790 --> 11:31.189
I was going to
ask you a question.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.390
Okay.

11:32.392 --> 11:36.061
Jackie, I was wondering

11:36.063 --> 11:39.731
if you'd like to go out
and get me some paper towels

11:39.733 --> 11:42.133
for Marco's sweaty pits.

11:42.135 --> 11:45.570
- Uh...
- No, no, no, no!

11:45.572 --> 11:47.739
That is not
what I meant to say.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.507
What I meant to say is,

11:49.509 --> 11:51.309
the sweat is gushing
down Marco's back

11:51.311 --> 11:53.144
- like a waterfall.
- ( nervous laugh )

11:53.146 --> 11:55.146
Now it's crossing the border
into Marco's undies.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.347
Aaaah!

11:56.349 --> 12:00.218
Okay, well, Jackie
is going to go now

12:00.220 --> 12:02.353
and get Marco
some paper towels

12:02.355 --> 12:04.089
for his wet body.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.490
( whimpers )

12:05.492 --> 12:08.026
That was so stupid!

12:08.028 --> 12:10.161
Hey, hey, now, Marco.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.063
It's not
that big a deal.

12:12.065 --> 12:14.866
I heard what happened.
Everyone's talking about it.

12:14.868 --> 12:17.235
Well, looks like you should
just give up on dating forever.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.504
Thanks for
the vote of confidence.

12:19.506 --> 12:22.040
I'm not gonna let
being tongue-tied stop me.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.008
Pen me.

12:24.010 --> 12:28.246
Jackie, will you
go out with me Friday night?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.115
Hey, uh, Jackie.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.382
Oh, hey,
there you are.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.351
I got your paper towels.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.853
Oh, uh...
( nervous giggle )

12:34.855 --> 12:36.621
Thanks. Here's
some paper for you.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.857
"Marco can't grow
hair on his chin,

12:38.859 --> 12:40.625
but he can
on his back"?!

12:40.627 --> 12:42.293
- Ha!
- What?!

12:42.295 --> 12:44.262
( reading quickly )

12:46.465 --> 12:47.732
( giggling )

12:47.734 --> 12:49.400
Bro, my jacket.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.202
Oh, sorry, Chet.

12:51.204 --> 12:53.638
No worries. It's just
a material possession.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.273
Marco thinks Chet
should punch him.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.575
- What?
- No, no, no.
I mean,

12:57.577 --> 13:00.612
if Marco were Chet,
he'd totally punch Marco.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.847
It's just a jacket, dude.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.984
Marco would lose
all respect for Chet

13:05.986 --> 13:07.719
if Chet didn't
punch Marco.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.654
Don't... don't make me
do this, bro.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.324
What happened
in there?

13:13.326 --> 13:15.093
I don't know
what got into me.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.427
Every time I'm
around Jackie,

13:16.429 --> 13:18.396
I keep blurting out
the wrong thing.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.231
Every night when
Marco goes to sleep,

13:20.233 --> 13:22.500
he shapes his pillow in the form
of Jackie Lynn Thomas.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.935
and kisses it
good night.

13:23.937 --> 13:25.303
Did you say something?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.138
( muffled speaking )

13:27.140 --> 13:28.973
( groaning )

13:32.945 --> 13:34.078
Marco,
what's happening?

13:34.080 --> 13:36.748
Wait. Let's see
where this goes.

13:36.750 --> 13:39.484
( anguished screaming )

13:39.486 --> 13:40.985
( all gasping )

13:45.357 --> 13:47.158
Hello.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.127
( yelps )

13:49.129 --> 13:51.529
Oh, you made
a little Marco Junior.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.331
'Sup, Marco Junior?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.534
Janna, that's not his hand.
That's...

13:56.536 --> 13:57.936
Oh, oh, oh.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.672
Marco Diaz covers the mirror
when he showers,

14:00.674 --> 14:02.340
because, because, because,

14:02.342 --> 14:05.543
because Marco is ashamed
of his own body!

14:05.545 --> 14:06.845
Oh, it's
so adorable.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.613
Are you crazy?!

14:08.615 --> 14:10.849
How am I ever gonna
ask out Jackie like this?

14:10.851 --> 14:12.951
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

14:12.953 --> 14:14.619
Did any of you get
the English homework assignment?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.821
Marco thinks...

14:16.823 --> 14:19.557
Oh, I can
show you, Jackie.
Come with me.

14:19.559 --> 14:23.294
That's it. I remember
where I've seen you before.

14:23.296 --> 14:26.564
Hey, where'd you get
my combination?

14:26.566 --> 14:28.032
From your diary.

14:30.836 --> 14:32.704
What is
that stuff?

14:32.706 --> 14:34.372
Just some of
my personal things.

14:34.374 --> 14:37.242
I've seen Marco Junior
somewhere before.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.409
Stop calling
it that!

14:38.411 --> 14:40.812
Here. The Naysaya.

14:40.814 --> 14:44.048
"The Naysay grows out of
the neck of its victim."

14:44.050 --> 14:47.151
Yes, that is Naysaya
when Naysaya was younger.

14:47.153 --> 14:49.387
"It reveals itself when
the afflicted

14:49.389 --> 14:51.389
attempts to woo
their true love,

14:51.391 --> 14:53.992
exposing the victim's
deepest, darkest secrets

14:53.994 --> 14:55.827
for all to hear."

14:55.829 --> 14:57.395
And to judge.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.063
What the heck
is that thing?

14:59.065 --> 15:00.732
JANNA: Oh, that's a demon.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.600
The Naysaya is
a total demon curse.

15:02.602 --> 15:04.602
( groans )
A demon.

15:07.072 --> 15:10.108
Dude, I'm so sorry.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.576
I totally put
that curse on you

15:11.578 --> 15:13.611
to prevent you from
asking out Star.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.446
Why would you do
something like that?

15:15.448 --> 15:17.882
That was before
we started hanging out.

15:17.884 --> 15:21.019
You haven't asked out a girl
since the Blood Moon Ball?

15:21.021 --> 15:24.088
That's way more embarrassing
than that thing on your neck.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.623
How do I
get rid of it?

15:25.625 --> 15:27.525
Just let it
run its course.

15:27.527 --> 15:29.861
Once it's shouted
all your worst,
most shameful secrets,

15:29.863 --> 15:31.429
it'll wear off.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.730
And how long
will that take?

15:32.732 --> 15:35.133
It depends.
How insecure are you?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.768
Oh, no.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.471
Good luck, dude.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.206
( knocking on door )

15:42.208 --> 15:45.643
STAR: Marco?
What did Tom say?

15:45.645 --> 15:49.447
Tom says Marco will have Naysaya
for the rest of his life,

15:49.449 --> 15:52.817
because, because, because
Marco is <i>so</i> insecure.

15:52.819 --> 15:55.486
You should
get back to school.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.587
You're missing class.

15:56.589 --> 15:58.656
Well, aren't you coming, too?

15:58.658 --> 16:00.892
I won't be going
to school anymore.

16:00.894 --> 16:03.561
What?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.667
Marco, it's just
a demon curse.

16:09.669 --> 16:13.071
Don't let Naysaya keep you
from what you want.

16:13.073 --> 16:15.773
( sighs )
Okay.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.742
The door is cutting off
the circulation to my finger,

16:17.744 --> 16:20.578
so I better get going.
Ooh, tingly.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.682
She's a good friend.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.351
All right, dude,
what do you want

16:26.353 --> 16:27.652
what do you want
to keep your mouth shut?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.354
What?

16:29.356 --> 16:31.356
What do you want?

16:31.358 --> 16:34.659
Marco wants to know
what Naysaya wants?

16:34.661 --> 16:38.529
But no one has ever
asked what Naysaya wants.

16:38.531 --> 16:41.299
Well, dude,
it's your lucky day.
What do you want?

16:41.301 --> 16:44.502
May Naysaya have
whatever he pleases?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.137
As long as you let me
ask Jackie out,

16:46.139 --> 16:47.538
you can have
whatever you want.

16:47.540 --> 16:50.274
Then Naysaya would like...

16:50.276 --> 16:51.609
cereal.

16:51.611 --> 16:54.312
Seriously?

16:54.314 --> 16:55.880
You can have cereal.

16:55.882 --> 16:57.682
But... but...

16:57.684 --> 17:00.518
Naysaya would like
to enjoy cereal

17:00.520 --> 17:03.621
in Naysaya's own mouth.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.024
Ahhhh.

17:08.494 --> 17:10.862
Will... will...
will it hurt?

17:10.864 --> 17:13.931
Just make sure you chew
with your teeth.

17:17.569 --> 17:18.903
Some more.

17:21.140 --> 17:22.707
Some more.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.477
Some more!

17:27.813 --> 17:30.581
Okay, so you promise
to keep your mouth shut, right?

17:30.583 --> 17:32.383
( swallowing )

17:32.385 --> 17:34.852
Naysaya is in your corner.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.721
( bell rings )

17:37.856 --> 17:39.290
That is so cute,
you guys.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.829
( sighs deeply )

17:44.831 --> 17:46.931
Hey, Jackie.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.666
Look. Is that Marco?

17:48.668 --> 17:50.234
He's going for it.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.904
Hey, Marco.
Are you cold?

17:52.906 --> 17:54.405
What's going on here
with the scarf?

17:54.407 --> 17:57.208
Oh, you know,
sometimes I...

17:57.210 --> 17:59.544
ski to school.

17:59.546 --> 18:01.712
No way! I snowboard.
Awesome!

18:01.714 --> 18:05.349
Yeah, yeah, there's probably
a lot of stuff

18:05.351 --> 18:07.218
you don't know about me.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.586
That's why I thought
it would be cool

18:08.588 --> 18:11.589
if we, uh, if we,
if you and I, if we...

18:11.591 --> 18:13.224
went on a...

18:13.226 --> 18:15.426
Oh, oh, oh,
this is the Jacqueline

18:15.428 --> 18:18.629
Marco practiced asking out
in the mirror. Oh!

18:18.631 --> 18:22.767
Marco even pretend-kissed you
with his own... reflection.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.936
Naysaya, you promised
you wouldn't do that.

18:24.938 --> 18:27.705
What's a promise?

18:27.707 --> 18:29.307
Look, I gotta go home.

18:29.309 --> 18:32.376
You're... you're
really confusing me.

18:35.314 --> 18:36.747
Jackie, wait!

18:36.749 --> 18:39.550
It's not me
saying this stuff.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.452
It's him.

18:41.454 --> 18:44.055
- Greetings, Jacqueline.
- ( gasps )

18:44.057 --> 18:46.424
That is disgusting.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.426
Is that
a British accent?

18:48.428 --> 18:51.129
Jackie, there's nothing
I can do.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.998
Got this curse thing
on my neck.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.767
But I'd still like
to ask--

18:56.769 --> 18:58.269
Marco hasn't taken a bath

18:58.271 --> 19:00.972
since he saw
that shark movie.

19:02.007 --> 19:03.774
He's right.

19:03.776 --> 19:06.677
I haven't taken a bath
since I saw that shark movie.

19:06.679 --> 19:08.779
I mean, I take showers.

19:08.781 --> 19:10.781
I'm just afraid
of the tub.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.518
Oh, oh, oh,
and Marco wears...

19:13.520 --> 19:15.319
I wear ballet shoes
around the house.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.787
And he never held hands--

19:16.789 --> 19:19.190
I never held hands
with a girl.

19:19.192 --> 19:21.325
- So I practiced
with Ferguson.
- And, and, and--

19:21.327 --> 19:23.327
I always sit
when I go to the bathroom

19:23.329 --> 19:25.196
What? Come on,
there's ladies in the house.

19:25.198 --> 19:28.099
I cry when it rains.

19:28.101 --> 19:31.169
I still got my wubbie
and his name is Esteban.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.771
Until last week, I thought
that the state of mind

19:33.773 --> 19:35.773
was between
Nebraska and Kansas.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.608
I'm a straight-A student,

19:37.610 --> 19:40.378
and I've still got no idea
how to do long division.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.680
Go ahead, someone
yell out a division.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.782
BOY: 724 divided by 7.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.118
I got no idea.
Get a calculator.

19:47.120 --> 19:48.686
Yes, but Marco--

19:48.688 --> 19:51.122
I filled a notebook
with my first name

19:51.124 --> 19:52.823
and your last name,

19:52.825 --> 19:54.992
because I couldn't decide
which looked better--

19:54.994 --> 19:56.861
Marco Diaz Lynne Thomas,

19:56.863 --> 19:58.996
or Marco Lynne Thomas Diaz.

19:58.998 --> 20:01.699
- Oh, oh...
- Oh, yeah,
and another thing.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.635
I kept this drawing
you made of the moon.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.537
I pulled it out of
the trash in art class.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.806
That's supposed to be
a watermelon.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.676
Oh, really?
Looks like a moon.

20:11.678 --> 20:15.913
Well, your watermelon
reminds me of my biggest
fear of all--

20:15.915 --> 20:18.583
that we're all alone
on this tiny blue marble,

20:18.585 --> 20:21.085
floating in the infinite
expanse of the universe,

20:21.087 --> 20:23.154
ripped from the center,

20:23.156 --> 20:25.990
and ejected out
into a black void
for no reason at all.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.993
Players on the stage
of the absurd.

20:28.995 --> 20:32.330
Wow, that was
really... deep.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.165
So there it is, Jackie Lynne.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.167
That's it.

20:36.169 --> 20:38.336
That's all my insecurities.
You know everything now.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.706
Unless I left
anything out.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.909
No, Marco, that's...

20:44.911 --> 20:46.744
everything.

20:46.746 --> 20:49.080
I still think it'd be
really great

20:49.082 --> 20:50.881
if we hung out
Friday night.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.883
Whoo!

20:52.885 --> 20:56.120
You know, a group of us
are all going to a movie
Friday night.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.788
You should totally come.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.225
That would be awesome.

21:01.227 --> 21:04.395
Cool. Well, see you then.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.864
You did it, you did it,
you did it, you did it!

21:06.866 --> 21:08.966
You did it,
you did it!

21:08.968 --> 21:11.235
You know who to call
when you get divorced, Marco.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.871
