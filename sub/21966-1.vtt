OPTIMUS:

00:02.959 --> 00:05.500
Rescue Force Sigma 17.

00:05.542 --> 00:08.750
You have learned much since

00:05.542 --> 00:08.750
my last routine inspection.

00:08.792 --> 00:11.333
I am impressed

00:08.792 --> 00:11.333
with what I see.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.834
I hope so.

00:11.375 --> 00:13.834
Heatwave waxed his chassis

00:13.875 --> 00:15.458
like nine times for this.

00:15.500 --> 00:17.125
But I also wish to examine

00:17.166 --> 00:19.000
how well you work with

00:17.166 --> 00:19.000
your partners.

00:19.041 --> 00:20.333
Yeah.

00:20.375 --> 00:21.875
Okay, Burns family.

00:21.917 --> 00:24.500
Let's show Optimus Prime

00:21.917 --> 00:24.500
what we've got.

00:24.542 --> 00:25.917
You can watch with me!

00:25.959 --> 00:27.458
I know the best seat

00:25.959 --> 00:27.458
in the firehouse.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.333
Thank you, Cody.

GRAHAM:

00:29.375 --> 00:30.917
Ready, Boulder?

00:30.959 --> 00:33.542
Just follow this sequence

00:30.959 --> 00:33.542
of angles and impacts

00:33.583 --> 00:35.041
and everything should work.

00:35.083 --> 00:37.625
On it, Graham.

00:35.083 --> 00:37.625
Let's get artistic.

00:38.875 --> 00:40.917

00:54.500 --> 00:56.083
KADE:  Yawn.

00:56.125 --> 00:58.375
Being a first responder

00:56.125 --> 00:58.375
is all about speed.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.709
Watch this!

01:01.834 --> 01:04.458
Just like we practiced, Chase.

01:01.834 --> 01:04.458
Hug the turns.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.041
I will embrace them heartily,

01:04.500 --> 01:06.041
chief.

01:07.792 --> 01:10.291
Hang on, Kade.

01:07.792 --> 01:10.291
This way's faster.

01:10.333 --> 01:13.375
Uh, but there's no road

01:10.333 --> 01:13.375
that way. Heatwave?

01:13.417 --> 01:17.375
Heatwave?!

02:46.875 --> 02:49.333
Not for long. We just have

02:46.875 --> 02:49.333
to fly higher and faster.

02:51.583 --> 02:55.000
Aah! Normally,

02:51.583 --> 02:55.000
I'd say "no way."

But today

02:55.041 --> 02:57.083
I'll make an exception!

( growling )

03:02.208 --> 03:04.917
Dad, I think we just

03:02.208 --> 03:04.917
got chased by a pterodactyl.

03:04.959 --> 03:07.792
Pterodactyl? I guess it

03:04.959 --> 03:07.792
doesn't know it's extinct.

Cody, do you have a visual?

It's landing on Mount Griffin.

03:10.583 --> 03:12.208
Call Doc Greene.

03:12.250 --> 03:13.875
Chase and I'll close

03:12.250 --> 03:13.875
the mountain trails

03:13.917 --> 03:16.333
and meet the team

03:13.917 --> 03:16.333
at the firehouse.

03:16.375 --> 03:19.750
A pterodactyl! How exciting.

03:19.792 --> 03:21.375
I've wanted to see one

03:21.417 --> 03:23.291
since I was the size

03:21.417 --> 03:23.291
of a compsognathus.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.750
I appreciate you

03:23.333 --> 03:25.750
taking a closer look, Doc.

03:25.792 --> 03:27.750
BLADES:

03:25.792 --> 03:27.750
I'm telling you,

03:27.792 --> 03:30.834
that pterodactyl is the same one

03:27.792 --> 03:30.834
that attacked me before.

03:30.875 --> 03:34.041
Wait, you mean months ago

03:30.875 --> 03:34.041
in the underground cave?

03:34.083 --> 03:36.875
I never forget something

03:34.083 --> 03:36.875
that tries to eat me.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.834
Maybe it flew up here somehow.

03:38.875 --> 03:40.542
When the mining

03:38.875 --> 03:40.542
tunnels collapsed.

03:40.583 --> 03:42.875
Much has happened

03:40.583 --> 03:42.875
in my absence.

03:42.917 --> 03:45.083
Definitely, sir.

03:42.917 --> 03:45.083
The humans gave thanks

03:45.125 --> 03:47.083
for the ritual stuffing of

03:45.125 --> 03:47.083
a creature called a turkey.

03:47.125 --> 03:50.083

A chain of explosions

03:53.458 --> 03:55.875
opened deep sinkholes

03:55.917 --> 03:57.542
beneath Griffin Rock.

03:57.583 --> 04:00.250
It's possible one of them

03:57.583 --> 04:00.250
reached as far down

04:00.291 --> 04:02.917
as the prehistoric caverns.

04:02.959 --> 04:04.208

Thank you, chief.

Doc, is that you?

05:11.500 --> 05:13.458
Unfortunately, yes.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.041
I can report that

05:13.500 --> 05:16.041
the pterodactyl is real.

05:16.083 --> 05:19.875
And she apparently

05:16.083 --> 05:19.875
finds me attractive!

05:19.917 --> 05:23.625
Doc, when I said observe that

05:19.917 --> 05:23.625
thing, I meant with a telescope.

05:23.667 --> 05:27.208
You say potato,

05:23.667 --> 05:27.208
I say  Solanum tuberosum.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.500
your type. Or species.

05:55.333 --> 05:57.834
There! Now that my tracking

05:55.333 --> 05:57.834
device is in place,

05:57.875 --> 05:59.291
we can release the pterodactyl.

05:59.333 --> 06:01.792
Release it?

05:59.333 --> 06:01.792
We just caught it.

06:01.834 --> 06:04.041
From her behavior,

06:01.834 --> 06:04.041
I judge this lizard bird

06:04.083 --> 06:05.583
to be a nesting mother.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.458
She'll want to get home

06:05.625 --> 06:07.458
to her babies.

06:07.500 --> 06:09.667
And if we track her

06:07.500 --> 06:09.667
back to her nest,

06:09.709 --> 06:11.250
we'll see how

not swims.

08:37.417 --> 08:41.000
(  ominous theme playing  )

08:41.041 --> 08:43.291
( roaring )

08:43.333 --> 08:45.625
(  heroic theme playing  )

08:45.667 --> 08:48.458
Run for the shore, Doc!

08:45.667 --> 08:48.458
Hurry!

08:50.875 --> 08:53.583
( dinosaur whining )

08:53.625 --> 08:56.709
Back off, scaly. I've dealt

08:53.625 --> 08:56.709
with your kind before.

08:56.750 --> 08:59.250
( Heatwave & Kade grunt )

08:59.291 --> 09:01.458
But that's a new one.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.083
( grunts )

09:04.125 --> 09:06.375
Can't you avoid him, Heatwave?

09:06.417 --> 09:08.166
Let's get out of here

09:06.417 --> 09:08.166
before those things

09:08.208 --> 09:10.917
smash us into fossil fuel!

09:08.208 --> 09:10.917
( Heatwave growls )

09:15.417 --> 09:17.083
( dinosaurs growling )

09:30.250 --> 09:32.000
( roars )

09:32.041 --> 09:35.125
Poor Trex. I'm sorry

09:32.041 --> 09:35.125
we had to leave him behind.

09:35.166 --> 09:39.750
We'll be back. I have a score

09:35.166 --> 09:39.750
to settle with those dinosaurs.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.750
Well? What do you think?

09:45.792 --> 09:49.125
Uh, I'm not even sure

09:45.792 --> 09:49.125
what language that is.

09:49.166 --> 09:52.834
Math! They're unsolvable

09:49.166 --> 09:52.834
equations from Gremski Tech.

09:52.875 --> 09:55.583
Heatwave told us about your

09:52.875 --> 09:55.583
Lad Pioneer project.

09:55.625 --> 09:57.917
Working on these would

09:55.625 --> 09:57.917
be perfect for it.

09:57.959 --> 09:59.875
But if they're unsolvable--

09:59.917 --> 10:01.542
They'll be even more fun!

10:01.583 --> 10:03.291
You two go ahead.

10:03.333 --> 10:06.000
I'm supposed to meet Chase

10:03.333 --> 10:06.000
in the bunker. But thanks.

10:07.333 --> 10:09.959
Chase? You down here?

10:11.792 --> 10:16.250
Welcome to Police Challenge,

10:11.792 --> 10:16.250
law enforcement's favorite game!

10:16.291 --> 10:18.959
Contestant Number 1,

10:16.291 --> 10:18.959
come on downward!

10:19.000 --> 10:21.333
Woo-hoo! Cody!

10:22.500 --> 10:25.834
Uh, Chase, what is all this?

10:25.875 --> 10:27.834
Your Lad Pioneer

10:25.875 --> 10:27.834
Merit Project.

10:27.875 --> 10:29.291
Blades assures me

10:27.875 --> 10:29.291
that game shows

10:29.333 --> 10:31.542
are fun and educational

10:29.333 --> 10:31.542
in equal measures.

10:31.583 --> 10:34.417
Question 1:

10:31.583 --> 10:34.417
You see a speeding car

10:34.458 --> 10:36.625
with a broken tail light

10:34.458 --> 10:36.625
in a construction zone.

10:36.667 --> 10:39.208
Which ordinances

10:36.667 --> 10:39.208
are being violated?

10:39.250 --> 10:42.667
( Blades humming quiz music )

10:42.709 --> 10:45.917
I-- I really don't know

10:42.709 --> 10:45.917
police codes.

10:45.959 --> 10:48.083
( imitates buzzer )

10:48.125 --> 10:50.417
The answer is: all of them!

10:48.125 --> 10:50.417
Ha-ha-ha!

10:50.458 --> 10:52.041
Time for the lightning round!

10:52.083 --> 10:53.792
Blades, is the lightning ready?

10:53.834 --> 10:57.458
Uh, thanks guys. But I don't

10:53.834 --> 10:57.458
think this is working out.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.208
Cody.

11:00.250 --> 11:03.125
It seems there are

11:00.250 --> 11:03.125
many helpful opinions

11:03.166 --> 11:05.125
about what your project

11:03.166 --> 11:05.125
should be.

11:05.166 --> 11:08.166
But no one has asked

11:05.166 --> 11:08.166
what you would like to do.

11:08.208 --> 11:11.500
That is the only answer

11:08.208 --> 11:11.500
that matters, Cody.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.125
And it can only

11:11.542 --> 11:14.125
come from you.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.750
KADE ( on PA ):

11:14.166 --> 11:15.750
Everyone to the garage.

11:15.792 --> 11:18.291
Doc's back,

11:15.792 --> 11:18.291
with a dinosaur of a tale.

11:20.291 --> 11:22.083
Then they attacked us!

11:22.125 --> 11:24.875
Herbivores and carnivores,

11:22.125 --> 11:24.875
working together!

11:24.917 --> 11:28.291
Yeah. And I've got

11:24.917 --> 11:28.291
the dino-sores to prove it.

11:28.333 --> 11:29.959
But where did

11:28.333 --> 11:29.959
they all come from?

11:30.000 --> 11:32.041
That subterranean passage

11:30.000 --> 11:32.041
Doc found.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.291
They could have been

11:32.083 --> 11:34.291
living underground

11:34.333 --> 11:35.625
for millions

11:34.333 --> 11:35.625
of years.

11:35.667 --> 11:38.125
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

11:35.667 --> 11:38.125
whoa, whoa!

11:38.166 --> 11:41.792
We've been walking on top of

11:38.166 --> 11:41.792
dinosaurs our whole lives?

11:41.834 --> 11:43.917
There are more things

11:41.834 --> 11:43.917
under this earth, Kade,

11:43.959 --> 11:46.000
than most humans know.

11:46.041 --> 11:49.500
I'd like to keep it that way.

11:46.041 --> 11:49.500
Look at this.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.667
The mayor

11:49.542 --> 11:51.667
has spared no expense

11:51.709 --> 11:53.583
in creating

11:51.709 --> 11:53.583
a tourist photo spot

11:53.625 --> 11:56.583
for our one and only

11:53.625 --> 11:56.583
Griffin Rock Pterodactyl.

11:56.625 --> 11:58.625
Uh,  trademark pending.

11:56.625 --> 11:58.625
Heh-heh.

11:58.667 --> 12:01.333
If the mayor knew

11:58.667 --> 12:01.333
what's over on Wayward...

12:01.375 --> 12:03.083
We have to protect

12:01.375 --> 12:03.083
those dinos.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.166
Get them back home underground.

12:03.125 --> 12:05.166
BLADES: W-W-Wait!

12:05.208 --> 12:08.792
You want us to willingly go

12:05.208 --> 12:08.792
to an island full of dinosaurs?

12:08.834 --> 12:11.250
No thanks.

12:08.834 --> 12:11.250
I've seen that movie.

12:11.291 --> 12:14.041
We would be honored if

12:11.291 --> 12:14.041
you led our mission, Optimus.

12:14.083 --> 12:16.917
Thank you, Heatwave.

12:14.083 --> 12:16.917
But I will stay with Cody

12:16.959 --> 12:20.375
and observe your team

12:16.959 --> 12:20.375
on a full-scale mission.

12:20.417 --> 12:22.333
We won't let you down, sir.

12:23.625 --> 12:26.417
Rescue Bots,

12:23.625 --> 12:26.417
roll to the rescue!

12:26.458 --> 12:30.000
(  heroic theme playing  )

12:30.041 --> 12:32.667
There. I boosted

12:30.041 --> 12:32.667
this hover camera's feed

12:32.709 --> 12:35.166
so Cody and Optimus can

12:32.709 --> 12:35.166
keep track of us at home.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.667
Good thinking Graham.

12:35.208 --> 12:37.667
Into your bots, everyone.

12:37.709 --> 12:39.792
We don't want

12:37.709 --> 12:39.792
any more surprises.

12:45.125 --> 12:46.917
Look, there's Trex!

12:46.959 --> 12:49.542
Trex is good boy.

12:49.583 --> 12:51.750
( roaring )

12:51.792 --> 12:54.333
And there's

12:51.792 --> 12:54.333
the scary version.

12:54.375 --> 12:56.959
(  ominous theme playing  )

12:57.000 --> 12:59.125
I wonder why the dinosaurs

12:57.000 --> 12:59.125
are so upset.

12:59.166 --> 13:00.583
We haven't

12:59.166 --> 13:00.583
done anything.

13:00.625 --> 13:02.875
Probably holding a grudge

13:00.625 --> 13:02.875
from last time.

13:02.917 --> 13:04.750
Clear those boulders out,

13:02.917 --> 13:04.750
team.

13:04.792 --> 13:06.417
Time for these dinos

13:04.792 --> 13:06.417
to go home.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.792
Stand aside

13:06.458 --> 13:09.792
for your own safety.

13:09.834 --> 13:11.959
Unh! And for mine as well.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.834
( growling )

13:17.834 --> 13:19.834
( grunting )

13:19.875 --> 13:21.792
Stop! We're trying

13:19.875 --> 13:21.792
to help you!

13:23.041 --> 13:26.417
Ugh.

13:23.041 --> 13:26.417
Maybe I wasn't clear.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.458
( grunting )

13:35.208 --> 13:37.792
Blades, what are you doing?

13:35.208 --> 13:37.792
We have to get out of here.

13:37.834 --> 13:43.125
If we stay really still he

13:37.834 --> 13:43.125
can't see us. I saw it on TV!

13:43.166 --> 13:44.625
( growling )

13:44.667 --> 13:46.333
What's our rule about

13:44.667 --> 13:46.333
television?

13:46.375 --> 13:48.667
Even if it's a documentary

13:46.375 --> 13:48.667
it's not always real.

13:48.709 --> 13:49.959
( roaring )

13:48.709 --> 13:49.959
Aah!

13:53.625 --> 13:57.291
Hey! He bit my tail rotor!

13:57.333 --> 13:58.917
Blades is hurt!

13:57.333 --> 13:58.917
We need help!

13:58.959 --> 14:01.458
( grunting )

14:01.500 --> 14:02.792
BOULDER:

14:01.500 --> 14:02.792
Gotcha, buddy.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.667
Fall back and regroup!

14:15.834 --> 14:18.625
That's strange. I wonder why

14:15.834 --> 14:18.625
the dinosaurs aren't chasing us.

14:21.959 --> 14:24.917
(  ominous theme playing  )

14:24.959 --> 14:27.125
CHASE:

14:24.959 --> 14:27.125
I believe you have

14:24.959 --> 14:27.125
your answer, Boulder.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.625
BLADES:

14:27.166 --> 14:29.625
Eww! What is this stuff?

14:29.667 --> 14:33.166
Tar. But since when are there

14:29.667 --> 14:33.166
tar pits on Wayward Island?

14:33.208 --> 14:36.417
This goo must have bubbled up

14:33.208 --> 14:36.417
from another underground rift.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.834
I don't care where it came

14:36.458 --> 14:38.834
from, how do we get out of it?

14:38.875 --> 14:40.792
We hope Cody and Optimus

14:38.875 --> 14:40.792
are watching.

14:44.792 --> 14:47.083
(  ominous theme playing  )

14:47.125 --> 14:50.250
( Rescue Bots grunting )

14:50.291 --> 14:54.250
Oh, no. They're stuck in that

14:50.291 --> 14:54.250
tar pit. And sinking fast.

14:54.291 --> 14:58.208
Then my time for simply

14:54.291 --> 14:58.208
observing has come to an end.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.917
Wait! Optimus, please.

14:59.959 --> 15:02.542
I have to go with you.

14:59.959 --> 15:02.542
They're my family.

15:02.583 --> 15:05.458
I understand how important

15:02.583 --> 15:05.458
they are to you Cody.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.959
You may ride with me.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.834
First we're going

15:07.000 --> 15:09.834
to have to find a boat.

15:09.875 --> 15:13.875
Where we're going,

15:09.875 --> 15:13.875
we don't need boats.

15:13.917 --> 15:16.709
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:21.625 --> 15:24.125
Dad, we're here.

15:21.625 --> 15:24.125
Are you guys okay?

15:24.166 --> 15:27.375
Been better, son.

15:24.166 --> 15:27.375
Glad you came to help.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.792
But be careful.

15:27.417 --> 15:29.792
Those dinosaurs mean business.

15:29.834 --> 15:32.083
OPTIMUS:

15:29.834 --> 15:32.083
As do we, Chief Burns.

15:32.125 --> 15:34.917
I am following

15:32.125 --> 15:34.917
your comm signal now.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.583
( growling )

15:44.667 --> 15:47.750
(  dramatic theme playing  )

15:50.125 --> 15:51.792
Why won't they let us through?

15:54.667 --> 15:58.959
OPTIMUS:

15:54.667 --> 15:58.959
These creatures view anything

15:54.667 --> 15:58.959
not a dinosaur as a threat.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.917
Too bad Trex can't help us.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.500
OPTIMUS:

16:02.333 --> 16:04.500
Perhaps he can.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.542
Stay here, Cody Burns.

16:09.583 --> 16:11.750
( dinosaurs growling )

16:11.792 --> 16:14.667

16:29.458 --> 16:32.000
( roars )

16:34.792 --> 16:37.250
Whoa! What did you just do?

16:37.291 --> 16:40.625
I scanned Trex

16:37.291 --> 16:40.625
to gain a new form.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.709
You look way cooler than Trex.

16:42.750 --> 16:46.667
Scanning a creature that is part

16:42.750 --> 16:46.667
biological and part machine

16:46.709 --> 16:49.875
can produce

16:46.709 --> 16:49.875
unpredictable results.

16:49.917 --> 16:52.417
Is that cool?

16:52.458 --> 16:54.959
Let's see what the other

16:52.458 --> 16:54.959
dinosaurs think.

16:58.417 --> 16:59.959
( roaring )

17:00.000 --> 17:03.000
( roars )

17:04.125 --> 17:05.458
Definitely cool.

17:05.500 --> 17:08.458
( Kade grunting )

17:08.500 --> 17:11.542
Heatwave, can't you open

17:08.500 --> 17:11.542
your window any further?

17:11.583 --> 17:13.709
Not unless you feel like

17:11.583 --> 17:13.709
swimming in tar.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.875
I told you you shouldn't have

17:13.750 --> 17:16.875
eaten that entire pizza.

What was that?

17:22.792 --> 17:24.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )

17:24.375 --> 17:26.291
Close the window!

17:27.709 --> 17:29.417
Don't worry, guys.

17:27.709 --> 17:29.417
It's just us.

17:29.458 --> 17:31.041
That's Optimus?

17:31.083 --> 17:34.834
Whoa! Optimus

17:31.083 --> 17:34.834
is a triple changer?

17:34.875 --> 17:37.166
Why didn't anybody tell me?

17:39.041 --> 17:40.583
Appreciate the assist, Optimus.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.291
And may I say, sir,

17:42.333 --> 17:44.333
I have never been so happy

17:42.333 --> 17:44.333
to be bitten by a dinosaur.

17:44.375 --> 17:47.291
(  dramatic theme playing  )

18:02.125 --> 18:03.583
( all grunting )

18:07.417 --> 18:10.000
Optimus, I apologize.

18:10.041 --> 18:12.041
We have failed you

18:10.041 --> 18:12.041
in this mission.

18:12.083 --> 18:14.667
This mission

18:12.083 --> 18:14.667
is not yet finished.

18:14.709 --> 18:17.208
Let us accomplish it

18:14.709 --> 18:17.208
together.

18:21.041 --> 18:23.041
( roars )

18:26.125 --> 18:28.917
( growling )

18:31.792 --> 18:33.709
( roaring )

18:37.291 --> 18:39.250
Ha! Those

18:37.291 --> 18:39.250
overgrown lizards

18:39.291 --> 18:41.375
don't stand a chance

18:39.291 --> 18:41.375
against Optimus.

18:41.417 --> 18:43.000
We'll clear that

18:41.417 --> 18:43.000
hole in no time.

18:43.041 --> 18:44.667
Wait, Heatwave!

18:44.709 --> 18:47.959
Has anybody asked the dinosaurs

18:44.709 --> 18:47.959
what they want to do?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.959
I don't think they'd answer.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.959
They're dinosaurs.

18:51.000 --> 18:54.625
Their objective is obvious. To

18:51.000 --> 18:54.625
keep us away from that opening.

18:54.667 --> 18:58.000
Maybe somebody should ask them

18:54.667 --> 18:58.000
why they want that so badly.

18:58.041 --> 18:59.917
You are right, Cody Burns.

18:59.959 --> 19:02.417
Their answer

18:59.959 --> 19:02.417
is the one that matters.

19:04.667 --> 19:07.250
( roars )

19:09.709 --> 19:12.375
Optimus is a dinosaur

19:09.709 --> 19:12.375
whisperer?

19:12.417 --> 19:14.458
I am so out of the loop.

19:17.542 --> 19:20.083
( all chittering )

19:22.875 --> 19:24.625
Baby dinosaurs!

19:24.667 --> 19:26.625
The adults were merely

19:24.667 --> 19:26.625
attempting

19:26.667 --> 19:28.333
to protect their young.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.667
That's why they wouldn't

19:28.375 --> 19:30.667
let anyone else near.

19:30.709 --> 19:33.125
Cover your ears, Cody Burns.

19:36.959 --> 19:38.959
( roars )

19:47.959 --> 19:49.625
Sir! They're

19:47.959 --> 19:49.625
attacking Optimus.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.959
No, Chase.

19:49.667 --> 19:51.959
They're thanking him.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.917
( dinosaur babies purring )

19:54.959 --> 19:57.166
( growls softly )

19:57.208 --> 19:59.250
( pterodactyl screeches )

19:59.291 --> 20:01.583
(  tender theme playing  )

20:09.166 --> 20:12.834
Oh! Dino babies

20:09.166 --> 20:12.834
are so cute!

20:12.875 --> 20:14.625
They bite too, you know.

20:14.667 --> 20:16.291
We'd better seal up that crack

20:16.333 --> 20:18.166
to keep those dinosaurs safe

20:16.333 --> 20:18.166
underground again.

20:18.208 --> 20:20.834
And off the mayor's

20:18.208 --> 20:20.834
tourist attraction list.

20:25.917 --> 20:28.583
Ugh. You are welcome, Trex.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.709
Next time, a simple

20:28.625 --> 20:30.709
handshake will suffice.

20:30.750 --> 20:33.333
Way to go Opti--

20:30.750 --> 20:33.333
( growling )

20:33.375 --> 20:34.625
Optimus?

20:37.250 --> 20:40.417
I am... Ah.

20:37.250 --> 20:40.417
Sorry, Heatwave.

20:40.458 --> 20:43.583
It seems I am not yet accustomed

20:40.458 --> 20:43.583
to my new primal form.

20:45.250 --> 20:47.458
Let's finish up here and get

20:45.250 --> 20:47.458
back to the boat, team.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.417
I think it's time

20:47.500 --> 20:50.417
this mission is prehistory.

20:53.542 --> 20:58.125
Ahh. Finally, I don't smell

20:53.542 --> 20:58.125
like a freshly-paved road.

20:58.166 --> 21:00.750
Tar is one of Earth's more

20:58.166 --> 21:00.750
pungent substances.

21:00.792 --> 21:02.667
Second, perhaps,

21:00.792 --> 21:02.667
to limburger cheese.

21:02.709 --> 21:06.208
Hey guys. Oh.

21:02.709 --> 21:06.208
Did Optimus leave already?

21:06.250 --> 21:08.291
Nope. He's staying

21:06.250 --> 21:08.291
a few more days.

21:08.333 --> 21:10.625
Least till he gets used to

21:08.333 --> 21:10.625
his new primal form.

21:10.667 --> 21:14.041
Good. I can't wait to show him

21:10.667 --> 21:14.041
my Lad Pioneer project.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.500
What did you decide to do?

21:15.542 --> 21:17.583
After our experience

21:15.542 --> 21:17.583
with the dinosaurs,

21:17.625 --> 21:19.291
I built a model of one.

21:19.333 --> 21:21.375
I tried to make it

21:19.333 --> 21:21.375
super-realistic.

21:21.417 --> 21:25.709
Aah!

21:21.417 --> 21:25.709
Who left this on my helipad?

21:25.750 --> 21:28.959
Congratulations.

21:25.750 --> 21:28.959
It appears you have succeeded.

21:30.875 --> 21:33.875
