NOW, I COULD GIVE IT
TO THE SCHOOL,

20:04.270 --> 20:08.040
OR I COULD TAKE IT TO VEGAS
AND TRIPLE MY WINNINGS.

20:09.408 --> 20:11.143
FOR THE KIDS,
OF COURSE.

20:15.114 --> 20:18.084
I WANT YOU
TO STOP TALKING TO ALBERTO.

20:18.084 --> 20:20.386
YOU KNOW VEGAS IS
FAMILY-FRIENDLY NOW, RIGHT?

20:21.454 --> 20:23.689
AND, HENRY, DON'T MAKE
YOUR SISTER FEEL BAD

20:23.689 --> 20:25.591
ABOUT HOW MUCH MORE
YOU MADE, OKAY?

20:25.591 --> 20:29.328
GUESS WHO RAISED
$200!

20:30.429 --> 20:31.664
WHAT?!

20:31.664 --> 20:34.300
CRIS TOLD ME TO SET UP
OUTSIDE A ZUMBA CLASS.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.501
PEOPLE EAT MORE CHOCOLATE

20:35.501 --> 20:37.303
WHEN THEY THINK
THEY'VE EARNED IT.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.074
AND IT'S
A GOOD THING, TOO,

20:42.074 --> 20:45.077
BECAUSE NOT ONE PERSON WAS HOME
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD

20:45.077 --> 20:46.312
WHEN I RANG THE DOORBELLS.

20:48.247 --> 20:51.016
OH, THEY WERE HOME, <i>AMA.</i>
THEY WERE HOME.
