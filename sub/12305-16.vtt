WEBVTT

00:08.794 --> 00:11.839
You go voluntarily, you wave
your right to fight extradition.

00:11.881 --> 00:14.091
It's not going to make
a difference, Rick.

00:19.472 --> 00:21.515
So what happens now?

00:21.557 --> 00:23.309
It's very simple.

00:23.392 --> 00:25.353
As far as I'm concerned...

00:27.480 --> 00:29.523
you are free to go.

00:49.752 --> 00:53.256
This is Mala Noche justice

00:54.257 --> 00:55.633
Como?

00:55.758 --> 00:57.385
Como?

02:46.327 --> 02:48.329
Mala Noche justice...

02:49.205 --> 02:50.873
meet Miami justice.

04:04.890 --> 04:06.183
You made it.

04:06.225 --> 04:09.603
Yeah, but a lot of people didn't.

04:09.645 --> 04:11.105
What's going on?

04:11.146 --> 04:14.066
Calleigh was abducted while
following a lead on the Newberry case.

04:14.108 --> 04:15.484
Searched for her all night.

04:15.526 --> 04:18.070
Finally tracked her GPS, we
were unable to locate her.

04:18.112 --> 04:19.113
Okay.

04:19.363 --> 04:20.656
Delko.

04:21.197 --> 04:23.408
Yeah, I'm with H right now.

04:24.284 --> 04:25.619
That's Tripp.

04:25.702 --> 04:26.995
They found Calleigh's Hummer.

04:27.037 --> 04:28.330
We got to find her.

04:39.550 --> 04:41.009
Aerial unit spotted it.

04:41.051 --> 04:43.095
No sign of Calleigh.
No eyewitnesses either.

04:43.137 --> 04:44.346
We'll be right down.

04:46.682 --> 04:49.560
Cell phone and her kit
are still in the car.

04:49.726 --> 04:53.939
Whoever did this was smart enough
to disable the GPS tracking unit.

04:59.278 --> 05:01.864
This is too damaged for I.B.I.S, Eric.

05:01.905 --> 05:04.950
Yeah. Yeah, well, shot
came through the window, so,

05:05.033 --> 05:08.829
there's probably a cleaner
bullet inside the car.

05:08.871 --> 05:12.583
Gentlemen, I don't see
any skid marks, do you?

05:12.624 --> 05:15.544
That means she slowed to
a stop before the gunfire.

05:15.586 --> 05:18.255
It also means this was an ambush.

05:18.464 --> 05:20.841
This just isn't sitting with me.

05:20.924 --> 05:24.428
Calleigh was armed. We all know she
wouldn't go down without a fight.

05:25.262 --> 05:27.055
What'd you get, Eric?

05:27.181 --> 05:29.933
Got some sort of reflective trace.

05:29.975 --> 05:34.271
Let's get that to the lab and I'll
catch up to you gentlemen later.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.236
What the hell you think
happened in Brazil?

05:41.361 --> 05:42.988
He didn't say.

05:43.781 --> 05:45.407
I'm just glad he's back.

06:26.198 --> 06:29.368
Hey, any luck with the trace
found outside Calleigh's Hummer?

06:29.409 --> 06:31.245
I wouldn't call it luck.

06:32.037 --> 06:34.164
Call it chloroform.

06:34.540 --> 06:36.500
No wonder she didn't put up a fight.

06:45.717 --> 06:48.762
Do you think that it's any
coincidence that Kathleen Newberry was

06:48.804 --> 06:50.556
also subdued with chloroform?

06:50.597 --> 06:52.641
I don't think that we can
afford any coincidences.

06:52.683 --> 06:55.686
Every minute that Calleigh's
missing, her odds get worse.

06:55.727 --> 06:59.773
Then I think we should speak to
Newberry's suspected killer, Ron Saris.

06:59.815 --> 07:01.316
Horatio's already on it.

07:04.153 --> 07:07.656
You chloroformed Kathleen
Newberry and then killed her.

07:07.698 --> 07:12.661
Horatio, as I told you before you
were arrested for murder in Brazil,

07:12.703 --> 07:14.705
Uh, there's no evidence to prove that.

07:14.746 --> 07:18.417
One of my CSI's was chloroformed
and abducted last night.

07:18.459 --> 07:20.461
And I see that as a pattern, Ron.

07:20.502 --> 07:23.005
Thousands of people can get
their hands on chloroform.

07:23.046 --> 07:24.131
Yes.

07:24.173 --> 07:26.008
But I'm only looking for one.

07:30.846 --> 07:32.055
Well, I'm happy for you,

07:32.097 --> 07:34.892
but I know you can't
hold me so, I'm,uh...

07:34.933 --> 07:37.978
I... I want to thank you. For Brazil.

07:38.020 --> 07:40.689
Um... worked out really well
for the two of us, didn't it?

07:40.731 --> 07:43.984
Because, uh, Julia and
I, we got back together.

07:44.735 --> 07:48.280
Best of luck finding your CSI.

07:48.322 --> 07:51.825
If anything happens to my CSI,

07:52.534 --> 07:55.120
this'll be your last week on earth.

08:24.691 --> 08:26.068
Pick her up.

08:34.076 --> 08:35.577
What do you want from me?

08:35.619 --> 08:38.496
We want to: "solve a
crime with Calleigh. "

08:38.705 --> 08:42.793
See, our poker buddy,
Robert, he, uh, hmm...

08:48.048 --> 08:50.092
he didn't give us what we wanted.

08:50.134 --> 08:52.010
So he had to pay the price.

08:52.136 --> 08:54.513
And then, Tommy found your website.

08:54.555 --> 08:56.181
Look, you're a CSI, right?

08:56.432 --> 08:58.809
Make it so this can't
be traced back to us.

08:59.226 --> 09:01.103
You expect me to cover up a murder?

09:01.562 --> 09:02.938
Okay. Okay.

09:03.021 --> 09:04.314
Uh, let me think.

09:04.356 --> 09:05.357
You need gloves.

09:05.399 --> 09:07.734
And we got to bleach the floor.

09:07.818 --> 09:13.740
Wipe up all the surfaces for fingerprints,
for shoe prints, for any skin trace.

09:13.824 --> 09:15.117
What else?

09:16.660 --> 09:19.371
I need to get the
bullet out of the body.

09:19.746 --> 09:21.457
They could trace it back to your gun.

09:21.498 --> 09:23.792
But you're going to have
to untie me for that.

09:49.526 --> 09:52.362
You're lucky. This
bullet's near the surface.

09:53.781 --> 09:54.990
Stop.

09:55.365 --> 09:56.742
Where do you think you're going?

09:56.784 --> 09:59.119
I need to get something
to get the bullet out with.

10:24.603 --> 10:26.021
Get rid of that.

10:27.022 --> 10:28.190
Good.

10:31.026 --> 10:33.695
You think you can get the
next bullet out on your own?

10:34.071 --> 10:35.114
Yeah?

10:36.365 --> 10:37.616
What do we need her for?

10:37.658 --> 10:38.617
I wouldn't do that.

10:38.659 --> 10:39.451
Why is that?

10:39.493 --> 10:40.786
That bullet smells like garlic.

10:40.828 --> 10:42.037
What the hell does that mean?

10:42.079 --> 10:44.957
It means I need you to
get me some toilet cleaner,

10:44.998 --> 10:47.793
a lint roller, speaker
wire and a black light.

10:47.835 --> 10:49.419
Yeah, we'll get right on that.

10:49.878 --> 10:51.505
You know, you should stop stalling.

10:51.547 --> 10:53.423
Just trying to do what
you asked me to do.

10:53.465 --> 10:55.300
Look, I think we should
see what she can do.

10:57.970 --> 10:59.012
Okay.

10:59.054 --> 11:01.014
You can be her delivery boy.

11:01.515 --> 11:06.270
It'll give me a chance to get
to know this bitch one on one.

11:07.938 --> 11:09.231
Go.

11:12.901 --> 11:14.778
I'd smoke that cigar.

11:15.195 --> 11:18.115
Yeah, I was planning to afterwards.

11:18.240 --> 11:19.575
But...

11:20.033 --> 11:21.994
if that's what turns you on, then...

11:22.035 --> 11:25.205
The smell of the cigar will
mask the smell of decomp.

11:25.247 --> 11:25.956
Yeah?

11:25.998 --> 11:29.918
Unless, of course, you want your
neighbors calling the cops down here.

11:30.461 --> 11:32.754
You're not as stupid as you look.

11:52.024 --> 11:54.193
Can we have a minute, son?

11:56.904 --> 12:00.115
Um, take these with you.

12:01.784 --> 12:04.411
Go ahead, sweetie, and
I'll see you in a second.

12:10.918 --> 12:14.338
I guess you weren't expecting
to see me again, huh?

12:14.379 --> 12:15.506
No.

12:16.089 --> 12:19.551
But Horatio, I didn't want you to die.

12:19.927 --> 12:24.973
I thought you'd have a better chance
in Brazil than here against Ron Saris.

12:25.015 --> 12:28.060
So I take it that's his dry cleaning?

12:28.102 --> 12:29.978
He's living with us now.

12:30.020 --> 12:32.648
- Whatever Ron is or isn't...
- He's a killer.

12:32.689 --> 12:33.816
He got me my son back.

12:33.857 --> 12:37.027
Yes, but he killed
Kathleen Newberry to do it.

12:37.069 --> 12:39.196
I had nothing to do with that.

12:40.531 --> 12:43.283
The one witness who saw
what Kyle did is gone.

12:43.325 --> 12:44.910
Can't you just let this go?

12:44.952 --> 12:46.411
One of my CSI's is missing.

12:46.453 --> 12:48.872
And you think Ron had
something to do with it?

12:48.914 --> 12:51.291
It was a roadside abduction,
that's his signature.

12:53.293 --> 12:54.253
Oh, my god.

12:54.294 --> 12:59.424
If you stay with this man,
you and Kyle are going to die.

13:37.880 --> 13:39.173
Pick it up.

13:51.101 --> 13:54.188
Tommy's out there running
errands, I thought that maybe...

13:54.229 --> 13:56.315
me and you could waste a little time.

13:56.648 --> 13:58.942
I'd rather die than have you touch me.

14:04.865 --> 14:06.200
Last words.

14:06.241 --> 14:07.701
- Let's hear them.
- Huh?

14:07.743 --> 14:10.037
I don't think you
killed the poker player.

14:29.891 --> 14:31.684
Took you long enough.

14:31.935 --> 14:35.105
Not like there's a store that
sells everything on earth, Seth.

14:35.355 --> 14:38.358
I need the toilet cleaner
and the stereo wire.

14:39.400 --> 14:43.738
Would you hand me one of those
mugs and a corkscrew, please?

15:03.967 --> 15:05.009
What are you doing?

15:05.051 --> 15:07.470
It's called the Reinsch test.

15:07.512 --> 15:09.848
I take some of his tissue

15:09.889 --> 15:13.643
and I put it into a solution
of hydrochloric acid.

15:13.685 --> 15:17.981
And the acid will separate the
inorganic from the organic molecules.

15:18.022 --> 15:20.024
It's basic chemistry.

15:20.358 --> 15:24.112
Then I put the copper wire
in and see if it turns gray.

15:24.279 --> 15:25.864
It's gray, so what?

15:25.905 --> 15:27.991
It's positive for the
presence of heavy metal.

15:28.032 --> 15:29.701
From the bullet when we shot him.

15:29.742 --> 15:32.579
No, it's a different kind of metal.

15:32.620 --> 15:35.373
Um, mercury, thallium, selenium,

15:35.415 --> 15:39.627
the atoms from one of those metals will
bind to the copper and turn it gray.

15:39.669 --> 15:42.922
I would say you're looking
at... acute arsenic poisoning.

15:42.964 --> 15:46.134
Wait, wait. So you're saying
that we could be off the hook?

15:46.676 --> 15:47.802
Seth.

15:47.844 --> 15:50.472
She's saying that somebody
killed him before we shot him.

15:50.513 --> 15:52.182
What's the black light for?

15:52.223 --> 15:53.808
It's for our next location.

15:53.850 --> 15:56.227
I can tell that this is
not the primary crime scene.

15:56.269 --> 15:58.396
No, no, no- we're not
taking you anywhere.

15:58.438 --> 16:00.315
You just told us he was poisoned.

16:00.356 --> 16:01.816
The bullet wound is perimortem.

16:01.858 --> 16:03.651
Ultimately, it's up to
the medical examiner,

16:03.693 --> 16:07.947
but the police could still charge you with
attempted murder, which is 25 years to life.

16:10.158 --> 16:13.578
If you make a sound, if you
even think about running,

16:13.620 --> 16:16.414
I promise you, I will not hesitate.

16:56.454 --> 16:57.747
You're not allowed in here.

16:57.789 --> 16:58.957
It's about Calleigh.

16:59.165 --> 17:01.042
- She's still missing, right?
- Yeah, she's still missing.

17:01.084 --> 17:02.293
She's been abducted, Coop.

17:02.335 --> 17:03.503
Now, what do you want?

17:05.296 --> 17:09.300
It's the memory card from the first
kidnap victim, Kathleen Newberry.

17:09.342 --> 17:10.760
I thought it might help you find her.

17:10.801 --> 17:12.011
Yeah, I hope so.

17:14.848 --> 17:19.144
There are a lot of similarities between
the Newberry case and Calleigh's.

17:19.227 --> 17:22.605
Chloroform, both kidnapped
from public places...

17:22.646 --> 17:25.442
Yeah, and Ron Saris doesn't
have an alibi for either one.

17:25.483 --> 17:26.984
If we could just get
that guy for murder,

17:27.026 --> 17:29.070
maybe we could get him to
tell us who he's working with.

17:29.112 --> 17:31.489
I won't let Calleigh end
up like that other woman.

17:37.120 --> 17:39.831
What's that? What is that line?

17:40.832 --> 17:44.127
Well, I'm not sure.
Let's take a closer look.

17:46.171 --> 17:47.255
Some kind of a string?

17:47.297 --> 17:49.716
That wasn't on the car when
we looked at it in our garage.

17:49.757 --> 17:51.217
Maybe it fell off in transit.

17:51.259 --> 17:54.345
Yeah, it's not like these tow
truck drivers look for evidence.

17:54.471 --> 17:57.140
You gotta be fair, though. They're
paid to tow, not solve our cases.

17:57.182 --> 17:59.309
All I'm saying is that if they
would've tried a little harder,

17:59.350 --> 18:00.393
then maybe Calleigh wouldn't be

18:00.435 --> 18:01.686
- missing right now.
- I know what you're saying.

18:01.728 --> 18:02.937
I'm just saying that we
could play "what if" all day.

18:02.979 --> 18:05.482
The important thing
is finding her, right?

18:06.274 --> 18:07.317
Yeah.

18:11.237 --> 18:12.280
Ryan,

18:12.614 --> 18:15.116
yeah, I need you to
stop by the tow yard.

18:22.957 --> 18:24.459
Excuse me, sir?

18:24.501 --> 18:25.543
Sir!

18:26.503 --> 18:28.671
Sir, could you do me a
favor and take a break?

18:28.713 --> 18:29.756
Sir, please?

18:29.798 --> 18:31.633
Could you do me a
favor and stop, please?

18:31.674 --> 18:32.592
May I help you?

18:34.803 --> 18:37.972
You could help me by taking
a little bit of a break.

18:38.848 --> 18:40.141
Thanks, man.

19:14.217 --> 19:15.260
Bingo.

19:27.605 --> 19:30.900
That's a match, Ron, a perfect match.

19:31.526 --> 19:33.653
Which places you at the scene.

19:33.695 --> 19:34.320
Correction.

19:34.362 --> 19:37.574
Uh, it puts a dirty piece of string
under a car that you pulled from a lake.

19:37.615 --> 19:42.454
I think that after you
pushed her car into the water,

19:42.495 --> 19:45.331
you caught your shoe under her bumper.

20:05.685 --> 20:07.061
All right.

20:07.103 --> 20:10.648
You know, I'm not gonna talk anymore.

20:10.690 --> 20:15.069
Conspiracy to kidnap a law enforcement
officer carries a life sentence.

20:15.111 --> 20:18.364
Why, Horatio, would
I bother with a CSI?

20:18.406 --> 20:20.617
Why would I do that when
I've got what I needed?

20:20.658 --> 20:21.910
I've got Julia back.

20:21.951 --> 20:24.621
And we both know how that happened.

20:24.829 --> 20:26.372
Don't we?

20:28.082 --> 20:30.168
By killing the Newberry lady?

20:30.210 --> 20:33.546
Okay, you're never going to prove that.

20:33.588 --> 20:34.881
Never.

20:36.549 --> 20:38.134
I just did.

20:38.551 --> 20:41.137
Not after I talk to the state attorney

20:41.179 --> 20:45.558
and tell them that you
coerced evidence unlawfully.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.477
Assault and battery.

20:47.685 --> 20:50.188
You beat me up to get what you needed.

20:50.230 --> 20:51.648
You stole my shoelace.

20:51.689 --> 20:53.108
Nice try, Ron.

21:08.414 --> 21:12.085
Well, that bruise should show up about
the same time as the state attorney,

21:12.127 --> 21:14.295
I would say, don't you?

21:14.629 --> 21:17.340
Now, Horatio, tell me.

21:17.632 --> 21:20.009
Are they gonna believe me,

21:20.051 --> 21:25.014
or are they gonna blame a cop who got
extradited to brazil for killing a man?

21:30.186 --> 21:32.564
Just remember what I said, Ron.

21:32.605 --> 21:33.481
I will.

21:34.357 --> 21:36.484
I'm going to go to Julia now.

21:40.029 --> 21:42.240
Oh, I'll say hi to your son for you.

21:43.741 --> 21:44.993
Do that.

21:46.119 --> 21:47.412
Ouch.

21:56.379 --> 22:00.300
You know, unless the bullet ricocheted,
it's probably on the passenger side.

22:00.425 --> 22:02.385
Well, I haven't found anything yet.

22:02.427 --> 22:05.889
Well, maybe the window shattered
when the bullet hit the door.

22:10.852 --> 22:12.771
Hand me a screwdriver.

22:13.480 --> 22:15.315
Yeah, what do you need it for?

22:15.482 --> 22:17.859
Got a crack in the door panel.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.402
Aren't we looking for a bullet hole?

22:19.444 --> 22:21.821
We are, but sometimes
this rigid plastic,

22:21.863 --> 22:24.282
it does funny things
when it's hit by a bullet.

22:24.407 --> 22:28.244
It'll crack open and snaps
back shut like a swinging door.

22:50.433 --> 22:52.227
I don't even have that gun anymore.

22:52.352 --> 22:54.854
Well, if you sold it, where's
the rece there is no receipt.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.398
There is no receipt. I lost
it in a poker game last night.

22:57.440 --> 22:59.400
What, nobody could change a hundred?

23:00.652 --> 23:04.114
I've lost my watch, my
boat, maxed-out my visa.

23:04.155 --> 23:05.907
The gun was all I had on me.

23:05.990 --> 23:07.867
Didn't change the cards, though.

23:07.909 --> 23:08.827
Who'd you lose it to?

23:08.868 --> 23:10.203
Like I know his real name.

23:10.245 --> 23:12.664
Well, no legal casino is gonna
allow you to bet with a gun.

23:12.705 --> 23:14.833
Sounds like an underground game to me.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.085
Yeah, so?

23:17.377 --> 23:21.131
So one of our own CSIs has
been abducted with that gun.

23:21.589 --> 23:23.466
You need to tell us
where the game was played.

23:23.550 --> 23:25.385
We've already got you on
illegal gambling, sport.

23:25.427 --> 23:27.011
It's time to show your cards.

23:27.095 --> 23:28.638
It was an old factory building.

23:28.680 --> 23:31.307
I think it was 1429 Wimberly.

23:32.934 --> 23:34.811
You better hope you're right.

23:35.270 --> 23:37.105
H, yeah, we got an address.

23:37.147 --> 23:39.023
1429 Wimberly.

24:03.590 --> 24:04.966
We got a body, Eric.

24:09.179 --> 24:11.181
It's not Calleigh.

24:13.183 --> 24:15.351
It smells like bleach.

24:19.272 --> 24:22.275
Well, his fingernails have been scraped.

24:22.567 --> 24:24.778
Body is positioned.

24:24.819 --> 24:27.489
Clothes pulled in a single direction.

24:27.530 --> 24:31.493
Someone took a lint roller
to him, removed any trace.

24:36.873 --> 24:39.000
The body's been cleaned.

24:39.876 --> 24:41.586
This whole room has.

24:41.628 --> 24:45.507
Professionally, which is why they
grabbed Calleigh to cover this murder.

24:45.548 --> 24:46.925
What have you got?

24:49.677 --> 24:51.262
I've got some prints.

25:03.441 --> 25:05.276
Got a lot of prints, H.

25:14.953 --> 25:16.538
It's a number 60.

25:16.704 --> 25:20.250
60 is a police code for a two-man unit.

25:20.291 --> 25:22.168
She's leaving us a message, Eric.

25:22.210 --> 25:24.003
She's telling us she
was taken by two men,

25:24.045 --> 25:26.047
which means she was alive
when she left this room.

25:26.089 --> 25:28.883
Yeah, but for how long?

25:46.840 --> 25:50.051
That's going to be priority
number one, gentlemen.

25:50.093 --> 25:51.469
Excuse me.

25:51.594 --> 25:52.470
Hey.

25:52.637 --> 25:53.763
What the hell's going on?

25:53.888 --> 25:55.265
And you are?

25:55.473 --> 25:57.267
I'm Mitch Davis. I own the building.

25:57.308 --> 25:58.935
I have plans to turn
this place into lofts.

25:58.977 --> 26:00.270
Nobody's supposed to be in there.

26:00.311 --> 26:04.357
Well, somebody was, Mr. Davis, and now
they're on the way to the coroner's office.

26:04.399 --> 26:07.235
You people really need to step
up the patrols around here.

26:07.277 --> 26:10.613
I am not in the business of providing
room and board to a bunch of squatters.

26:10.655 --> 26:13.950
A man was shot and killed and
found next to a poker table.

26:13.992 --> 26:15.410
Does that ring a bell?

26:15.452 --> 26:16.578
A poker table?

26:16.661 --> 26:18.872
First murder, now illegal
gambling. Well, th-that's great.

26:18.913 --> 26:21.166
So what am I supposed
to do- build a moat?

26:21.207 --> 26:23.376
Why don't you start
with security cameras?

26:35.638 --> 26:37.682
Now you can see our cleaning job.

26:39.100 --> 26:41.144
I'm gonna need the black light.

26:41.436 --> 26:42.896
What do you need that for?

26:43.063 --> 26:44.564
Show you what you missed.

27:02.082 --> 27:04.084
This is where Robert was shot.

27:04.626 --> 27:05.919
What the hell, man?!

27:05.960 --> 27:08.630
- I thought you said you cleaned it.
- I did, I swear.

27:08.671 --> 27:11.299
His wound was in the abdomen, and
based on the amount of blood here,

27:11.341 --> 27:14.094
I would say that he landed face down.

27:14.135 --> 27:15.428
Y- you're right.

27:15.553 --> 27:19.224
We just wanted to ask him where the
next poker tournament was going to be.

27:19.349 --> 27:21.059
So you guys like to gamble?

27:21.101 --> 27:22.769
No, we like the entry fee.

27:22.811 --> 27:23.812
Tonight's the big one.

27:23.853 --> 27:26.356
Ten guys with 100 k buy-in each.

27:26.439 --> 27:28.608
So you were planning
a robbery. And what?

27:28.650 --> 27:30.026
Robert got in the way?

27:30.151 --> 27:32.362
Look, no, we thought he was our in.

27:32.404 --> 27:34.864
We used to play nickel ante
games down at the marina.

27:34.906 --> 27:36.116
He liked it.

27:36.157 --> 27:39.452
When we asked him for the
address, he, like, freaked out.

27:44.374 --> 27:45.500
I told you.

27:45.542 --> 27:46.543
I don't know where.

27:46.584 --> 27:48.628
Just give us the address.

27:48.878 --> 27:50.672
This tournament isn't for you.

27:50.714 --> 27:54.968
Toss a few more cards and
come back in a couple years.

28:01.891 --> 28:04.185
I thought he was trying
to make a move on us.

28:04.894 --> 28:07.021
Was Robert using this flask?

28:07.480 --> 28:08.398
Yeah.

28:08.440 --> 28:11.401
If he was poisoned, we might be
able to get something off of it.

28:11.443 --> 28:14.362
Go to the medicine cabinet,
see if you can find some iodine.

28:14.404 --> 28:15.488
Why?

28:15.613 --> 28:17.032
You'll see.

28:57.364 --> 28:58.448
Stop!

28:58.698 --> 29:00.283
What are you trying to do?

29:00.367 --> 29:02.702
Start a fire, get the cops here?

29:02.952 --> 29:04.454
Look, this is called a fuming chamber.

29:04.496 --> 29:05.914
The smoke is supposed to be there.

29:05.955 --> 29:09.584
The hot chemical is going to stick
to any print that's on the flask.

29:18.551 --> 29:19.844
I've got two prints.

29:19.886 --> 29:22.806
Okay, if you give me
yours, I can exclude you.

29:22.972 --> 29:24.849
Do I look stupid to you?

29:25.141 --> 29:28.186
You just want our prints so that
your friends can pick us up later.

29:28.228 --> 29:31.231
You know what, if you don't trust
me now, you're never going to.

29:31.272 --> 29:33.233
I don't trust cops.

29:33.733 --> 29:35.610
You can have my prints.

29:36.069 --> 29:37.153
I trust you.

29:41.825 --> 29:43.993
Look, I don't know what
he's been telling you,

29:44.035 --> 29:45.578
but this is not going to end well.

29:45.620 --> 29:48.081
We're already in too deep.
We have no other choice.

29:48.123 --> 29:49.249
No, that is not true.

29:49.290 --> 29:51.751
If you take the flask to
the police, give it to them,

29:51.793 --> 29:54.212
it will point them in a
totally different direction.

29:54.254 --> 29:56.089
You've got to turn yourself in.

29:56.131 --> 29:57.924
I'm telling you it is the only way.

29:57.966 --> 29:58.633
I don't know.

29:58.675 --> 30:01.136
I do. You are not the
same person that he is.

30:01.177 --> 30:03.722
Just find a way to get out
of here, any way you can.

30:03.888 --> 30:05.765
What kind of excuse? I
Don't know what to say.

30:05.807 --> 30:06.516
I'll give you one.

30:06.558 --> 30:08.309
What are you two talking about?

30:09.769 --> 30:11.396
We're going to need bleach soon.

30:11.730 --> 30:13.398
You're up, delivery boy.

30:16.609 --> 30:19.696
So, Alexx, this is our poker player.

30:19.779 --> 30:22.782
Yeah, Horatio, but there's no id yet.

30:22.824 --> 30:27.328
And something weird his heart
showed signs of cardiac arrest.

30:27.370 --> 30:28.830
He had a heart attack?

30:28.872 --> 30:29.914
Yes.

30:29.956 --> 30:32.751
So I sent some samples to tox.

30:32.792 --> 30:38.298
Turns out it was caused
by acute arsenic toxicity.

30:38.339 --> 30:41.092
So the poisoning
caused the heart attack.

30:41.134 --> 30:45.055
There was also significant
postmortem tearing around the wound,

30:45.096 --> 30:47.265
as if someone had gone digging.

30:47.307 --> 30:49.350
And look at this, Horatio.

30:50.185 --> 30:52.979
From weird to weirder.

30:53.271 --> 30:55.732
Alexx, that's a piece of a cigar.

30:55.774 --> 30:59.027
Okay,you're saying that as
if it makes perfect sense.

30:59.069 --> 31:02.655
Inside the layering of
that tobacco could be dna.

31:02.697 --> 31:04.240
I'm gonna take that with me.

31:11.081 --> 31:14.626
So you're saying that Calleigh left
this in the wound tract for us to find?

31:14.667 --> 31:15.960
I am.

31:19.047 --> 31:20.882
Pick it up.

31:24.761 --> 31:28.973
Will you hand me one of those
mugs and a corkscrew, please?

31:41.486 --> 31:44.781
Seth McAdams, attempted rape.

31:45.865 --> 31:47.659
Here we go.

31:52.414 --> 31:55.208
I had units roll out to
Seth McAdams' last known.

31:55.250 --> 31:56.710
What did we learn, Frank?

31:56.876 --> 31:58.253
He hasn't been seen in days.

31:58.294 --> 31:59.546
No sign of the guy.

32:01.214 --> 32:02.716
Hang on a second.

32:02.882 --> 32:04.634
Can I help you?

32:11.683 --> 32:13.226
The name's Tommy.

32:13.268 --> 32:14.978
I know something about a murder.

32:15.019 --> 32:15.979
Talk to me.

32:16.020 --> 32:18.148
But I had, like nothing
to do with it, though.

32:18.189 --> 32:20.066
Look,I-I even got proof.

32:22.736 --> 32:26.031
Does this have to do
with the missing CSI?

32:27.157 --> 32:28.867
Me and my friend...

32:29.993 --> 32:31.244
we took her.

32:47.427 --> 32:50.305
Where is the missing CSI right now?

32:50.346 --> 32:52.599
7501 whitlock.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.601
Robert Milland's house.

32:54.642 --> 32:55.977
Take him, Frank.

32:56.019 --> 32:57.270
Take him.

32:58.438 --> 33:01.524
Eric, 7501 whitlock.

33:01.566 --> 33:02.609
Get SWAT.

33:02.650 --> 33:05.570
Tactical units to 7501 whitlock.

33:05.612 --> 33:07.989
Officer hostage situation in progress.

33:15.789 --> 33:16.664
Clear.

33:16.748 --> 33:17.624
We clear?

33:17.707 --> 33:18.541
All clear.

33:28.385 --> 33:29.469
H?

33:30.011 --> 33:31.679
Yeah, the house is clean.

33:31.721 --> 33:34.974
I'm not sure if Calleigh was
here, but, uh, she's not now.

33:35.016 --> 33:35.934
What else?

33:35.975 --> 33:37.435
Hang on a second.

33:42.023 --> 33:45.235
Found an interesting
picture of our murder victim.

33:45.318 --> 33:48.738
He's with that guy, the landlord, that said
he has nothing to do with the poker games.

33:48.780 --> 33:50.031
So he's a liar.

33:50.073 --> 33:51.241
Bring him in.

33:54.494 --> 33:56.663
I didn't shoot Robert.

33:57.664 --> 33:59.708
Neither did the killer.

33:59.749 --> 34:02.293
He was poisoned using arsenic.

34:02.335 --> 34:03.878
You lied to us.

34:03.920 --> 34:07.966
Because you knew robert milland,
and you knew about the poker game.

34:08.007 --> 34:10.135
Yeah, well, that's only half true.

34:10.176 --> 34:11.344
I knew Robert.

34:11.386 --> 34:15.556
We used to hit vegas together, but
he got tired of the casino scene.

34:15.598 --> 34:18.851
Said that underground
poker was more... exciting.

34:18.893 --> 34:21.353
So you let him use your buildings
for a cut of the action?

34:21.396 --> 34:22.230
No way.

34:22.272 --> 34:23.940
Those games are full of criminals.

34:23.982 --> 34:25.817
Robert liked to play the gangster.

34:25.859 --> 34:26.609
Not me.

34:26.650 --> 34:28.527
So you're saying he broke
into your buildings?

34:28.570 --> 34:30.405
Yeah. I had trouble
unloading the building.

34:30.447 --> 34:32.532
He took advantage of it. Pissed me off.

34:32.574 --> 34:35.577
And you wanted to make sure
that'd never happen again, right?

34:36.077 --> 34:38.871
I swear, I didn't.

34:39.621 --> 34:41.916
You know where csi Duquesne is?

34:42.167 --> 34:44.460
Because if you do, you better tell me.

34:44.710 --> 34:48.797
Lieutenant Caine is working on the killer's
fingerprints, and if they match yours,

34:49.549 --> 34:52.092
I'm not going to be
so nice a second time.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.770
You sure you don't
know where Tommy went?

35:01.811 --> 35:04.189
You heard him he went to get bleach.

35:04.230 --> 35:08.568
Yeah, and he never came back after
whispering in the corner with you.

35:10.403 --> 35:13.073
Maybe he got caught,or
maybe he got scared.

35:13.114 --> 35:15.575
You're the one who
should be scared, bitch.

35:15.617 --> 35:18.536
See, you just became my new partner.

35:18.578 --> 35:22.957
And we're about to pull off the
biggest heist in underground Miami.

36:14.419 --> 36:16.712
Why don't you tell me why I'm here?

36:17.505 --> 36:19.799
You poisoned Robert Milland with arsenic

36:19.841 --> 36:23.594
I personnally recovered your
fingerprints from his flask

36:28.266 --> 36:29.434
I just...

36:30.810 --> 36:32.562
couldn't lose again.

36:33.813 --> 36:35.898
Explain that, please.

36:35.940 --> 36:37.024
I was in a rut.

36:37.066 --> 36:38.609
Robert was too good.

36:38.651 --> 36:41.362
He was always rubbing it
in my face, you know,just...

36:41.612 --> 36:44.449
always had to bring up the new Rolex.

36:44.490 --> 36:45.908
The Donzi.

36:45.950 --> 36:47.326
His Hummer.

36:47.535 --> 36:50.329
All paid for by my kid's college fund.

37:02.508 --> 37:03.801
Sorry, girls.

37:05.219 --> 37:08.056
Looks like community
college for the little ones.

37:14.145 --> 37:17.732
I didn't want my wife to
find out how deep I was in.

37:17.774 --> 37:21.903
So by getting rid of him, you
figured you'd increase your odds.

37:21.944 --> 37:25.198
I had to win back some of what I lost.

37:25.364 --> 37:27.325
For my family...

37:28.576 --> 37:31.245
I just wanted to mess
with his game, so I...

37:31.287 --> 37:33.081
I spiked his flask.

37:54.811 --> 37:56.854
Look, the guy never took a sip.

37:57.522 --> 37:59.816
Walked away with the biggest pot
of the night. How'd he do that?

37:59.857 --> 38:02.360
He drank it after the game, Paul.

38:02.402 --> 38:04.404
It gave him a heart attack.

38:12.328 --> 38:15.873
You didn't lose your gun in
that game, did you, Paul?

38:15.915 --> 38:17.041
No.

38:17.583 --> 38:18.626
I was so pissed.

38:18.668 --> 38:21.170
I drove by Robert's place afterwards.

38:21.337 --> 38:23.047
I saw the Hummer a few streets over.

38:23.089 --> 38:24.424
I thought it was his.

38:24.465 --> 38:25.716
Fired off a few rounds.

38:25.958 --> 38:29.086
Freaked when i saw the CSI decal.

38:30.087 --> 38:32.423
I don't blame you.

38:41.390 --> 38:44.602
have we made any
progress, Miss Boa Vista?

38:45.895 --> 38:48.189
I had the techs scour this entire place,

38:48.230 --> 38:52.485
and there's just nothing that says that
Tommy Garver or Seth McAdams was ever here.

38:52.526 --> 38:56.238
Well, what we do know is they
had Calleigh clean the place.

38:56.280 --> 38:59.909
She did such a great job of
helping us id these suspects.

38:59.951 --> 39:03.287
I just wish there was a way she
could have told us where she went.

39:03.329 --> 39:05.206
Maybe there is.

39:11.629 --> 39:14.131
Better not miss one fingerprint.

39:16.384 --> 39:18.594
Hello, talk to me.

39:19.470 --> 39:22.014
Club Descent, 6:00 P. M.

39:22.598 --> 39:24.141
I'll be there.

39:24.183 --> 39:26.143
$100,000 buy-in?

39:26.227 --> 39:27.728
Perfect.

39:28.938 --> 39:30.564
Yes, I got her.

39:30.606 --> 39:32.191
Okay. All right.

39:32.275 --> 39:34.402
And if I'm not mistaken,

39:35.152 --> 39:37.154
baking soda...

39:39.448 --> 39:41.659
and grape juice...

39:50.543 --> 39:52.878
look at that.

39:53.462 --> 39:55.047
Invisible ink.

39:55.089 --> 39:56.632
Precisely.

39:56.674 --> 39:58.676
Descent. 6 P.M.

39:58.718 --> 40:00.136
Club Descent. You know it?

40:00.177 --> 40:01.470
I know it.

40:02.179 --> 40:03.931
Just got one last little errand,

40:03.973 --> 40:07.059
and then this is all gonna
be over for you, my dear.

40:07.101 --> 40:08.394
The poker game?

40:08.436 --> 40:09.687
That's my girl.

40:10.688 --> 40:12.356
What do you need me for?

40:12.398 --> 40:15.526
Let's just say I'm not
exactly on the invite list.

40:15.568 --> 40:16.444
Here.

40:16.485 --> 40:17.278
My badge.

40:17.403 --> 40:18.571
Get him to open the door.

40:18.613 --> 40:19.655
Go!

40:21.032 --> 40:22.908
Miami-Dade P.D.

40:26.454 --> 40:28.164
Sorry. Invitation only.

40:28.205 --> 40:29.874
Yeah, here's my invite.

40:35.046 --> 40:37.590
All right, ladies, poker game's over.

40:37.632 --> 40:39.383
I want all your cash now.

40:39.425 --> 40:40.426
Come on.

40:55.441 --> 40:58.069
Drop the guns, or I will shoot her.

41:04.492 --> 41:07.036
You're not gonna get the chance.

41:12.041 --> 41:15.670
Now, if I were you, I'd fold.

41:15.711 --> 41:19.298
Don't you agree, Calleigh?

41:20.383 --> 41:21.592
Clear!

41:26.013 --> 41:28.307
You messed with the wrong people.

41:50.371 --> 41:52.039
So you're sure you're okay?

41:52.081 --> 41:53.457
Yeah, I'm fine.

41:56.127 --> 41:57.128
what are you gonna do?

41:57.169 --> 41:58.588
Are you gonna take some time off?

41:58.671 --> 42:00.256
I really don't know, to be honest.

42:00.298 --> 42:03.759
I think I just want to go
home, think about what happened.

42:08.931 --> 42:11.017
Hey, you're not going home alone.

42:11.434 --> 42:12.893
Eric, I'm fine.

42:12.977 --> 42:15.438
I really am, I promise, but thank you.

42:16.355 --> 42:17.523
I'm not.

42:20.860 --> 42:24.488
I don't know what I would have done if
something would have happened to you today.

42:29.368 --> 42:30.494
Okay.
