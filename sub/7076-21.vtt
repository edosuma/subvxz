WEBVTT

00:01.081 --> 00:04.167
A new day has dawn
at Greendale Community College.

00:04.168 --> 00:05.971
Some said we'd never
bounce back

00:05.971 --> 00:08.686
after the unfortunate events
of the Star-Burns wake riot

00:08.687 --> 00:10.988
instigated
by the Greendale Seven.

00:10.989 --> 00:12.557
But today the guilty parties
have been expelled,

00:12.558 --> 00:14.475
enrollment is up,

00:14.476 --> 00:16.894
and tuition is more affordable
than ever.

00:16.895 --> 00:19.046
And the architect
of this modern-day miracle?

00:19.047 --> 00:21.599
Security chief
Benjamin Franklin Chang,

00:21.600 --> 00:23.851
a man who has brought security,
harmony,

00:23.852 --> 00:26.154
and success to what
is fast becoming

00:26.155 --> 00:27.855
the area's
premier community college.

00:27.856 --> 00:31.993
Greendale's never been better.
Thanks, Chang.

00:31.994 --> 00:34.078
You see?
It's not the real Dean.

00:34.079 --> 00:35.196
Of course.

00:35.197 --> 00:37.215
The head of security
at Greendale Community College

00:37.216 --> 00:38.449
has kidnapped the Dean

00:38.450 --> 00:41.902
and replaced him
with a deanel-ganger.

00:41.903 --> 00:44.205
Well, when you say it
that way, it sounds ridiculous.

00:44.206 --> 00:46.207
Yeah, the word we used
was doppel-deaner.

00:46.208 --> 00:48.576
Look, I hate cops.

00:49.911 --> 00:51.912
You have to do something.

00:51.913 --> 00:53.097
Isn't this a felony?

00:53.098 --> 00:55.717
Chang is holding a man
against his will.

00:55.718 --> 00:57.969
The real Dean
never would have expelled us.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.187
He loved us.

00:59.188 --> 01:01.806
Unfortunately,
love is not admissible evidence.

01:01.807 --> 01:04.090
Oh...

01:04.092 --> 01:09.030
♪ Love is not
admissible evidence ♪

01:09.031 --> 01:10.782

01:12.901 --> 01:14.101

We'll get some proof.

01:16.405 --> 01:17.455
No, you won't.

01:17.456 --> 01:18.740
If I catch any of you
within 50 feet

01:18.741 --> 01:20.825
of Greendale,
I'll throw you all in jail.

01:22.578 --> 01:25.830

02:00.315 --> 02:03.317
- I'm watching you.
- Move along.

02:03.318 --> 02:05.002
How's the planning going

02:05.003 --> 02:07.755
for my birthday
Chang-stravaganza?

02:07.756 --> 02:09.372
The magician's booked,
and the invitations went out

02:09.374 --> 02:11.125
to the school board
and the budweiser frogs.

02:11.126 --> 02:12.176
Perfect.

02:12.177 --> 02:14.212
Yeah, um, one little snag.

02:14.213 --> 02:16.113
See, we're kind of running out
of money,

02:16.114 --> 02:17.548
what with all the students
dropping out

02:17.549 --> 02:19.166
and the cost of your throne.

02:19.167 --> 02:20.818
It's a prescription throne.

02:20.819 --> 02:22.537
I have back mumps.

02:22.538 --> 02:23.805
Don't look it up.
It's rare.

02:23.806 --> 02:25.223
But you might be right.

02:25.224 --> 02:28.309
We should free up some revenue
for entertainment at the party.

02:28.310 --> 02:30.611
Where's my deanel-Chang-er?

02:33.649 --> 02:35.850
Fire the custodial staff.

02:35.851 --> 02:38.986
Okay. Cool.

02:38.987 --> 02:40.187
Do you think I could get out
a little early?

02:40.188 --> 02:41.856
My wife's getting
her braces off, and I...

02:41.857 --> 02:45.159
- No.
- Okay.

02:50.249 --> 02:52.700
I love how binoculars
make far away things

02:52.701 --> 02:53.885
seem like they're close.

02:53.886 --> 02:56.721
- They're like...
- Telephones for your eyes.

02:56.722 --> 02:58.389
Snagged one of those flyers.

02:58.390 --> 03:00.374
First Chang kidnaps the Dean,

03:00.375 --> 03:02.510
and now he throws himself
a birthday party?

03:02.511 --> 03:05.062
It's just like Stalin
back in Russia times.

03:05.063 --> 03:06.647
Dance-off?
Sundae bar?

03:06.648 --> 03:08.649
One of those Ed Hardy
street magicians?

03:10.352 --> 03:14.105
What kind of monster would...
Photo booth with props!

03:14.106 --> 03:15.940
Chang's got to be holding
the Dean on campus,

03:15.941 --> 03:17.859
but there's no way we're
gonna get past those guards.

03:17.860 --> 03:21.279
We need somebody on the inside.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.297
I may know a guy.

03:23.298 --> 03:25.566
And the air-conditioning
repair annex won't admit

03:25.567 --> 03:27.618
to any knowledge
of what's going on.

03:27.619 --> 03:31.672
But the fact is,
wherever there is air,

03:31.673 --> 03:32.957
we have eyes.

03:32.958 --> 03:34.258
Gross.

03:34.259 --> 03:35.543
Suffice it to say,

03:35.544 --> 03:37.895
if Chang were holding
your Dean captive,

03:37.896 --> 03:40.097
it'd be pretty foolish
to hold him on campus.

03:40.098 --> 03:43.417
It'd be even more foolish to
hold him in a central air room

03:43.418 --> 03:46.304
in the cafeteria,
which we monitor.

03:46.305 --> 03:51.809
Oh, no, Jeffrey.
Looks like PB and J again.

03:51.810 --> 03:54.261
You win the bet.

03:54.262 --> 03:55.313
So he's
in the cafeteria building?

03:55.314 --> 03:57.481
Suppose he is.
In the basement.

03:57.482 --> 03:59.767
And suppose you wanted
to get to him.

03:59.768 --> 04:01.619
Suppose you actually managed
to make it

04:01.620 --> 04:03.120
past the guards at the front,

04:03.121 --> 04:04.939
there's 50 more inside,
armed to the teeth

04:04.940 --> 04:07.658
with stun batons
and misplaced sexual aggression.

04:07.659 --> 04:09.160
Let's say you happen
to get past them

04:09.161 --> 04:10.661
and then you get to meet
Chang's number one,

04:10.662 --> 04:12.580
Joshua,

04:12.581 --> 04:16.116
a 4'10", 105-pound bucket
of piss and zit cream.

04:16.117 --> 04:18.970
I cannot express to you how much
I hate this kid.

04:18.971 --> 04:22.122
Now, beyond that dog sneeze
in a pair of reeboks,

04:22.123 --> 04:23.391
you're gonna find
a state-of-the-art

04:23.392 --> 04:24.809
keypad on the basement door.

04:24.810 --> 04:27.812
And just for extra fun,
they change the code every day,

04:27.813 --> 04:30.648
and the only copy is locked up
in Chang's office.

04:30.649 --> 04:33.150
Now, just for a lark,
let's pretend

04:33.151 --> 04:34.852
you actually make it down
to the basement door.

04:34.853 --> 04:36.470
Who is there to greet you?

04:36.471 --> 04:38.806
Another guard and another lock

04:38.807 --> 04:40.124
to which there is only one key.

04:40.125 --> 04:45.112
And where is that key?

04:47.783 --> 04:49.316
Well where is it?

04:49.317 --> 04:52.119
Oh, sorry,
it's very clear in my head.

04:52.120 --> 04:53.621
Key's around Chang's neck.

04:53.622 --> 04:56.907
The point is, you're not getting
down there without our help.

04:56.908 --> 04:57.925
So help us.

04:57.926 --> 04:59.343
We have no horse in this race,

04:59.344 --> 05:04.966
but... there is
one thing we want.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.551
Not a lot of people
get a second chance.

05:07.552 --> 05:12.339
Just you and probably Obama.

05:12.340 --> 05:16.711
Give it some thought.

05:16.712 --> 05:18.312
Great, so according
to Troy's intel,

05:18.313 --> 05:19.613
Greendale is impregnable.

05:19.614 --> 05:21.816
- So what do we do?
- Only one answer.

05:21.817 --> 05:22.984
Elaborate heist?
Elaborate heist?

05:22.985 --> 05:24.151
We'll need disguises.

05:24.152 --> 05:25.536
I do a great swami.

05:25.537 --> 05:27.071
Of course it works
best with a cobra,

05:27.072 --> 05:29.240
but if you guys cut me
a length of garden hose...

05:29.241 --> 05:30.357
Are we all forgetting
that if we get caught

05:30.358 --> 05:31.659
on that campus, we go to jail?

05:31.660 --> 05:33.861
Do you know how long someone
as sarcastic as I am

05:33.862 --> 05:35.246
would last in prison?

05:35.247 --> 05:37.031
Such a long time.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.667
There's got to be
a practical way to do this.

05:39.668 --> 05:40.885
There is another way in.

05:40.886 --> 05:44.055
If I enroll in the AC school,
they'll help us.

05:44.056 --> 05:46.157
We could walk in and out.

05:46.158 --> 05:47.408
It'll mean I'll have
to move out of here

05:47.409 --> 05:48.826
and into AC school housing,

05:48.827 --> 05:50.928
and I won't be able to hang out
with you guys anymore,

05:50.929 --> 05:53.397
or have a relationship,
or use the word

05:53.398 --> 05:54.732
"sensational" for some reason.

05:54.733 --> 05:57.818
Troy, we are not losing you
to save the Dean

05:57.819 --> 06:02.523
or Greendale...
Or anything, ever.

06:03.942 --> 06:07.328
Don't be so dramatic, Troy.
The answer is simple.

06:07.329 --> 06:09.563
We just have to plan
an elaborate heist.

06:09.564 --> 06:11.398
- Yes.
- Great, I'll get my turban.

06:11.399 --> 06:14.668
Everyone except Pierce has
to plan an elaborate heist.

06:16.000 --> 06:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:23.729 --> 06:26.599
Happy birthday, Ben.
On behalf of the school board.

06:26.600 --> 06:30.786
Shower organizer?
Are you guys psychic?

06:30.787 --> 06:33.439
Well you deserve it.
You have worked wonders here.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.074
Oh, you boners.

06:35.075 --> 06:36.492
Now go party your butts off.

06:36.493 --> 06:38.861
Your butt could use it, Richie.

06:46.086 --> 06:47.420
Listen up, men.

06:47.421 --> 06:49.472
Keep an extra deep lookout
for the Greendale Seven.

06:49.473 --> 06:51.891
I won't have them ruining
my 25th birthday.

06:51.892 --> 06:52.925
Yes, sir.

06:52.926 --> 06:56.229
By the way,
your cake just arrived.

06:56.230 --> 06:57.980
Shirley will enter first

06:57.981 --> 06:59.982
through the loading dock
disguised as the chef.

06:59.983 --> 07:02.401
From there, she'll head
into the kitchen.

07:02.402 --> 07:04.520
You had time to build
a tiny working water fountain,

07:04.521 --> 07:05.571
and I'm a pinecone?

07:05.572 --> 07:10.276
♪ Chang eats the sun
and drinks the skies ♪

07:10.277 --> 07:15.481
♪ and they both go
with him when he dies ♪

07:15.482 --> 07:19.452
Once in,
she'll unload the goods.

07:23.507 --> 07:26.425
This girl in Chicago
won't stop facebooking me.

07:26.426 --> 07:29.929
Looks like j-swag's
going deep dish.

07:29.930 --> 07:31.830
Then it's time for phase two...

07:31.831 --> 07:34.300
Toilet trouble.

07:34.301 --> 07:37.553
Oh, crap!
Someone call a plumber!

07:37.554 --> 07:39.021
Sounds like
you schnooks got a flood

07:39.022 --> 07:40.856
the size of my wife's
attitude problem.

07:40.857 --> 07:42.692
Whoa, you guys aren't
the usual plumbers.

07:42.693 --> 07:45.227
Oh, Mr. Brand Loyalty
over here.

07:45.228 --> 07:46.479
Okay, okay,
why don't you two slap-arounds

07:46.480 --> 07:47.763
give me your names
for the report

07:47.764 --> 07:49.782
in case Chang wants to know
why his birthday party

07:49.783 --> 07:51.200
<i>turned into the frickin'
Poseidon adventure.</i>

07:51.201 --> 07:53.986
Okay, okay.
Follow me then.

07:53.987 --> 07:56.355
Finally.
Oof baboof with you two.

07:56.356 --> 07:57.573
Here's your problem.

07:57.574 --> 07:59.659
You people gotta
start chewin' your food.

07:59.660 --> 08:01.627
We may have to tap into
the hydraulic flap valve,

08:01.628 --> 08:03.796
so don't be alarmed if things
get a little noisy.

08:03.797 --> 08:05.881
Like my wife's mouth.

08:05.882 --> 08:08.584
If we can break through this
wall and into Chang's office,

08:08.585 --> 08:10.970
then we'll have access
to the basement door codes.

08:10.971 --> 08:13.372
Meanwhile, I'll take care
of cancelling the magician.

08:13.373 --> 08:16.175
Yeah, sorry, Mr. Nightshade,
gig's canceled.

08:16.176 --> 08:17.876
How's it coming
with the guard?

08:17.877 --> 08:19.044
Boys are pathetic.

08:19.045 --> 08:20.879
Two days of facebooking
with this Joshua kid

08:20.880 --> 08:22.348
and he's eating out
of my hands.

08:22.349 --> 08:24.100
"Got a new flavor of lip balm.

08:24.101 --> 08:26.102
Meet me at Chili's
in ten minutes."

08:26.103 --> 08:27.603
Sheep.

08:27.604 --> 08:29.555
Um, I just want to reiterate
that this should be

08:29.556 --> 08:32.158
the only time you seduce
a child over the internet.

08:32.159 --> 08:33.442
I know.

08:33.443 --> 08:36.245
Chili's? Sick!

08:36.246 --> 08:38.331
Hey, bro, you watch my post?

08:38.332 --> 08:41.866
Yeah, whatever. 'Sup.

08:41.868 --> 08:43.001
I'm in.

08:43.003 --> 08:44.370
Cue the abra cadabra.

08:44.371 --> 08:46.038
Is that me
in my swami disguise?

08:46.039 --> 08:49.241
No, Pierce, for the last time,
you're in the getaway van

08:49.242 --> 08:51.644
because your swami act
is notoriously horrible.

08:51.645 --> 08:53.746
"A," that is racist.

08:53.747 --> 08:57.383
"B," swamis can't drive...
they're Indians.

08:57.384 --> 08:58.934
Pierce, just do your part.

08:58.935 --> 09:00.720
Leave the entertainment
to Britta and me.

09:07.944 --> 09:10.763
Ricky Nightshade,
the rock and roll magician.

09:10.764 --> 09:13.566
I'm starting.
I need a volunteer.

09:13.567 --> 09:17.870
I'll kill anyone who raises
their hand.

09:20.073 --> 09:24.627
Pick a card and look at it.

09:24.628 --> 09:25.944
Strap him!

09:37.090 --> 09:38.307
I'm in.

09:47.801 --> 09:49.602
Okay,
it was just my head before,

09:49.603 --> 09:51.070
but now I'm really in.

09:52.439 --> 09:55.408
Bingo.

09:56.827 --> 10:01.113
4-1-2-6.

10:02.866 --> 10:07.620
I'm in.
Where's the key?

10:07.621 --> 10:09.338
- I'm in.
- I know.

10:09.339 --> 10:11.290
Well, everybody
else got to say it.

10:13.427 --> 10:15.344
Is this your card?

10:15.345 --> 10:16.829
Huh?

10:16.830 --> 10:19.215
I don't remember.

10:22.052 --> 10:25.187
Nightshade, nightshade!

10:25.188 --> 10:28.140
Greetings, greetings,
baba ghanoush.

10:28.141 --> 10:29.942
Take me to the birthday boy.

10:29.943 --> 10:32.194
Wait a minute.

10:32.195 --> 10:33.345
Pierce?

10:33.346 --> 10:35.364
No, not knowing this Pierce.

10:35.365 --> 10:37.399
I... I am a mystical swami.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.869
I come to boogie down,
I'm boogying down.

10:39.870 --> 10:40.870
Hey!

10:41.872 --> 10:43.155
Jeff, we've been made.

10:43.156 --> 10:44.156
Cover me!

10:44.157 --> 10:46.525
Winger!

10:47.861 --> 10:49.027
No!

10:49.028 --> 10:50.162
Everything all right, Ben?

10:50.163 --> 10:52.214
Peachy keen, Avril Lavigne.

10:52.215 --> 10:56.218
Nathan, tell me
you got eyes on the Dean.

10:56.219 --> 10:59.221
Negative, the pixie has left
the toadstool.

10:59.222 --> 11:03.175
No! Where's my monitor?

11:05.479 --> 11:07.263
Gotcha.

11:07.264 --> 11:08.547
Code Chang.

11:08.548 --> 11:11.233
All units converge
on the south library hallway.

11:11.234 --> 11:13.402
The best part of the plan
is that at a certain point,

11:13.403 --> 11:16.221
it's going to look like
the plan is failing.

11:16.222 --> 11:17.690
But that's when
it's going to turn out that

11:17.691 --> 11:22.227
the failing plan
was all part of the plan.

11:22.228 --> 11:26.949
♪ Chang eats the sun
and drinks the sky ♪

11:41.080 --> 11:42.932
Hey, Johnny Passerby,
this job's getting bigger

11:42.933 --> 11:44.934
than my wife's credit card bill
at Marshalls.

11:44.935 --> 11:46.435
I mean, they got great stuff,
I know that.

11:46.436 --> 11:48.771
Anyway, I'm going to need
your Dean for approval.

11:48.772 --> 11:51.924
Craig.
Is that "a-i" or "i-a"?

11:51.925 --> 11:53.442
I always forget.

11:54.811 --> 11:57.530
Oof baboof, I spilled
plumber's acid all over yous.

11:57.531 --> 11:58.764
What do I do?
What do I do?

11:58.765 --> 11:59.932
Take off your clothes.

11:59.933 --> 12:01.600
Nathan, tell me you got eyes
on the Dean.

12:01.601 --> 12:04.286
Negative, the pixie has left
the toadstool.

12:04.287 --> 12:09.074
Repeat, the pixie has left
the toadstool.

12:10.744 --> 12:11.744
Jeffrey!

12:11.745 --> 12:13.412
Oh... Hey, Britta.

12:15.415 --> 12:17.216
How the Chang?

12:17.217 --> 12:18.918
I'm contaminated
with plumber's acid,

12:18.919 --> 12:22.922
but it's okay, they're coming
back with a lotion.

12:35.852 --> 12:39.572
Sar-cas-tic claps.

12:39.573 --> 12:41.073
Pretty clever.

12:41.074 --> 12:42.825
A plan that looked
like it failed,

12:42.826 --> 12:44.309
and then turned out to work.

12:44.310 --> 12:46.779
Too bad your real plan
really failed.

12:48.081 --> 12:49.248
What's so funny?

12:49.249 --> 12:50.749
You idiot.

12:50.750 --> 12:53.419
The plan was for the plan
to seem like it was failing.

12:53.420 --> 12:54.420
You think you caught us,

12:54.421 --> 12:56.488
but we've already made it out
with the real Dean.

12:56.489 --> 12:58.340
<i>Ocean's eleven, baby.</i>

12:58.341 --> 13:02.160
<i>Pierce, I'm the real Dean.</i>

13:02.161 --> 13:03.929
Getting caught the first time
was part of the plan.

13:03.930 --> 13:06.765
This time is because we suck.

13:06.766 --> 13:09.001
Shirley, where the hell
did you come from?

13:17.243 --> 13:19.611
- You can't hold us here forever.
- I don't need to, Winger.

13:19.612 --> 13:20.996
I just wouldn't want you
to leave before

13:20.997 --> 13:23.081
the big fireworks show.

13:23.082 --> 13:24.282
Fireworks show?

13:24.283 --> 13:26.334
It's a surprise
for the end of the night

13:26.335 --> 13:27.786
planned by the "Dean."

13:27.787 --> 13:29.487
Only, silly Dean,

13:29.488 --> 13:32.791
he stored all the fireworks
in the records room. Aw.

13:32.792 --> 13:34.593
And when the works
"accidentally" go off

13:34.594 --> 13:37.262
when I hit the final note
on my awesome keytar solo,

13:37.263 --> 13:38.663
they'll burn up
the school's records

13:38.664 --> 13:40.382
and all evidence of my misdeeds.

13:40.383 --> 13:43.001
<i>Chang, you're insane.
You're still into keytar?</i>

13:43.002 --> 13:45.020
We're going to tell the board
what you did!

13:45.021 --> 13:46.021
We're going
to tell the board what you...

13:46.022 --> 13:47.188
You think they'll believe

13:47.189 --> 13:48.807
the Greendale Seven
and the worst Dean ever

13:48.808 --> 13:50.675
over the guy who just nailed
an awesome solo?

13:50.676 --> 13:53.812
You're going to burn down
the school and kill everyone!

13:53.813 --> 13:55.697
Fire can't go through doors,
stupid.

13:55.698 --> 13:58.450
It's not a ghost.

14:00.620 --> 14:02.854
I know this is a bit
of a long shot,

14:02.855 --> 14:05.624
but I don't suppose any of you
paid my rent?

14:05.625 --> 14:08.960
Thank you, everyone,
for joining in my celebration.

14:08.961 --> 14:13.031
As many of you know,
I ate my twin sister in utero.

14:13.032 --> 14:16.134
So on my birthday,
I try to remember

14:16.135 --> 14:18.386
I'm a winner.

14:18.387 --> 14:20.555
This one's for you, Connie.

14:25.645 --> 14:28.847
And a-one, a-two,
a Chang, Chang, Chang-four.

14:34.186 --> 14:35.537
We're all going to die.

14:35.538 --> 14:36.538
We have to get out of here.

14:36.539 --> 14:38.974
How?

14:59.578 --> 15:00.912
It's a miracle.

15:00.913 --> 15:01.913
What?

15:01.914 --> 15:02.914
- Yes!
- Let's get out of here!

15:02.915 --> 15:04.082
Come on, come on, come on.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.768
No, Troy, you didn't...

15:06.769 --> 15:10.105
There's no time.
We gotta go.

15:20.533 --> 15:22.951
Six guards, two on scooters.

15:22.952 --> 15:24.085
Chang started his solo.

15:24.086 --> 15:25.453
Knowing him,
that gives us only nine minutes

15:25.454 --> 15:26.454
to get to the records room.

15:26.455 --> 15:27.622
We'll need a distraction.

15:27.623 --> 15:30.909
You heard the lady.
Take your tops off.

15:30.910 --> 15:32.494
I might have something.

15:32.495 --> 15:33.962
To supplement
Greendale's budget,

15:33.963 --> 15:36.331
I've been renting the school out
for raves on the weekend.

15:36.332 --> 15:37.966
They call it "academania."

15:37.967 --> 15:41.136
It's mostly hard house,
some... some dubstep,

15:41.137 --> 15:42.387
- but totally...
- Perfect.

15:42.388 --> 15:43.638
Troy and Abed,
you make a run for it.

15:43.639 --> 15:46.141
Dean,
I think it's time to party.

15:46.142 --> 15:49.460
Hmm.

15:49.461 --> 15:51.463
Hey, what the freak?

15:51.464 --> 15:52.814
What's going on?

15:52.815 --> 15:55.483
No! No! No!

15:55.484 --> 15:57.652
- You weigh nothing!
- I can't see them.

15:57.653 --> 16:02.524
They're too many of them.

16:02.525 --> 16:03.992
- Oof.
- Baboof.

16:08.497 --> 16:09.581
Which wire do I cut?

16:09.582 --> 16:11.199
There's only one.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.818
God, I hope I'm right.

16:26.515 --> 16:28.833
Study group!

16:30.269 --> 16:33.138
You did it!
So we're done, right?

16:33.139 --> 16:35.673
We're done?
Done? Done? Done?

16:35.674 --> 16:36.975
Not done.

16:36.976 --> 16:39.944
You foiled me for the last time.

16:44.683 --> 16:49.187
So, it ends as it began.

16:49.188 --> 16:50.655
It didn't begin this way.

16:50.656 --> 16:52.690
What the hell's going on
in here?

16:52.691 --> 16:54.876
Hey, fellas.

16:54.877 --> 16:56.795
I just caught
the Greendale Seven

16:56.796 --> 16:58.463
trying to burn down
the school.

16:58.464 --> 17:01.166
I'm a hero.
How about that cake?

17:01.167 --> 17:03.051
He's lying.
He kidnapped the Dean.

17:03.052 --> 17:05.203
Yeah, we gathered that much
when we found these two

17:05.204 --> 17:06.421
slap-fighting in the hallway.

17:06.422 --> 17:07.555
You stole my life!

17:07.556 --> 17:11.643
It is hard out there
for a fake Moby!

17:11.644 --> 17:15.847
Carl, Richie,
let me ex-Chang.

17:17.983 --> 17:21.853
I'm not getting paid,
am I?

17:21.854 --> 17:23.404
Hey!

17:23.405 --> 17:26.608
So a madman
in a Napoleon costume

17:26.608 --> 17:29.194
ran the school into the ground
and almost blew it up?

17:29.195 --> 17:31.863
Yeah.
And on our watch.

17:31.864 --> 17:33.031
What happened to us?

17:33.032 --> 17:35.233
Well, I have
a drinking problem.

17:35.234 --> 17:36.234
We're going to get fired.

17:36.235 --> 17:37.368
Only a matter of time

17:37.369 --> 17:39.904
until everyone finds out
what happened here.

17:39.905 --> 17:42.006
Nobody can sit on something
this big.

17:42.007 --> 17:44.909
I'll sit on it.

17:44.910 --> 17:47.262
When I became Dean,
I made a pledge

17:47.263 --> 17:49.013
to swallow
this school's failures

17:49.014 --> 17:55.053
and spit out degrees
because that's what deans do.

17:55.054 --> 17:56.387
You'd do that for us?

17:56.388 --> 17:57.388
No.

17:57.389 --> 17:59.190
I do it for Greendale.

17:59.191 --> 18:00.692
Aw.

18:00.693 --> 18:02.644
It's great to have you back,
Craig.

18:02.645 --> 18:05.864
It's almost as if you were
never unknowingly gone.

18:05.865 --> 18:07.982
Yard margs at Skeeper's.

18:07.983 --> 18:09.767
Perfect.
I left my credit card there.

18:09.768 --> 18:11.102
Thanks, Craig.

18:12.271 --> 18:14.939
You guys saved me.

18:14.940 --> 18:18.776
I don't know
how I will ever repay you.

18:18.777 --> 18:21.079
You already have.

18:26.869 --> 18:28.887
Troy,
you don't have to do this.

18:28.888 --> 18:31.222
The AC school has no claim
on your soul.

18:31.223 --> 18:32.290
No, but I do.

18:32.291 --> 18:33.725
A man's only as good
as his word,

18:33.726 --> 18:36.344
or his nod through a camera
to a guy with a button.

18:42.518 --> 18:45.937
It's time.
Say your goodbyes.

18:48.307 --> 18:50.775
Shirley, never change.

18:50.776 --> 18:52.977
Or do, if you want,
I'm not your boss.

18:52.978 --> 18:56.080
Oh, honey.

19:01.170 --> 19:03.254
Never wear a rubber.

19:08.928 --> 19:12.997
Never listen to Pierce.

19:16.468 --> 19:19.270
Whenever you finally finish
that Jigsaw puzzle...

19:19.271 --> 19:24.392
Will you tell me what kind of
boat is at the end of that dock?

19:29.031 --> 19:30.982
This is a lock of my hair.

19:32.701 --> 19:34.118
Creepy.

19:49.718 --> 19:53.037
All right, let's go.

20:07.820 --> 20:09.988
Abed?

20:09.989 --> 20:11.406
What did he say to you?

20:11.407 --> 20:15.360
He said, "I know you hate
when people do this in movies."

20:15.361 --> 20:16.945
Sorry I got emotional.

20:27.172 --> 20:29.924
Troy Barnes.

20:29.925 --> 20:32.260
Welcome home.

20:36.124 --> 20:39.210
I'm really digging
this hard house!

20:39.211 --> 20:41.028
It's quite a groove.

20:41.029 --> 20:43.130
This is my school!

20:43.131 --> 20:44.531
It's called Greendale,

20:44.532 --> 20:47.701
and I'm the Dean
of the entire school.

20:47.702 --> 20:52.339
I mean, I wasn't for a while,
but it's a long story.

20:52.340 --> 20:54.058
You guys, everybody,

20:54.059 --> 20:56.376
you should come by during
the day sometime.

20:56.377 --> 20:58.312
It's totally different.

20:58.313 --> 21:01.565
Really, stop by.
It'll blow your minds.

21:01.566 --> 21:03.851
You can meet my best friend,
Jeffrey.

21:03.852 --> 21:07.137
Sure, I'll take a back rub.
Who's asking?
