WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:06.256
- Hi.
- Hey. I don't feel so good.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.133
Aw! What's going on?

00:08.425 --> 00:09.426
Let's see.

00:09.635 --> 00:12.804
Ooh! You are kind of warm.
Maybe get rid of some of these blankets.

00:15.182 --> 00:16.391
Oh, that is cute.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.685
You tried to scare me for Halloween.

00:18.769 --> 00:21.396
How in the world
did that not frighten you?

00:21.480 --> 00:23.273
Some of this is my actual blood.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.816
I nicked myself putting it on.

00:24.900 --> 00:27.319
Sweetie, you don't know
the first thing about scaring people.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.695
It's all about plausibility.

00:28.779 --> 00:32.115
And you were awfully casual
for a guy who just got an ax in the chest.

00:32.199 --> 00:33.659
You know,
if you really wanted to scare me,

00:33.659 --> 00:35.327
you should've waited
until I opened the closet

00:35.327 --> 00:37.287
and found you hanging by a necktie.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.664
Excuse me!

00:38.997 --> 00:40.541
I killed myself?

00:40.541 --> 00:42.209
Yeah. Totally plausible.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.086
I mean, you've been
so happy all these years,

00:44.086 --> 00:45.796
the other shoe is bound to drop, right?

00:46.380 --> 00:49.550
By the way, I am not married
to the whole necktie thing.

00:49.550 --> 00:53.387
It could be, um, shotgun, or poison,

00:53.387 --> 00:55.556
- or a power drill to the eye!
- Stop. Stop!

00:55.722 --> 00:56.890
Now you're scaring me.

00:57.349 --> 00:58.517
That's how you do it.

00:59.643 --> 01:00.644
Bam!

01:15.117 --> 01:16.285
Hey, happy Halloween.

01:16.285 --> 01:17.911
It was until your mother ruined it.

01:17.995 --> 01:20.873
Oh, he's just mad because
he tried to scare me and he couldn't.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.040
I'm tough to scare.

01:22.124 --> 01:23.250
My girlfriend's pregnant.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.668
No!
Phil.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.171
She's our age. If she was pregnant,
it'd be on the news.

01:27.171 --> 01:28.255
But good one.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.049
Dad, I'm sorry. I don't have time
to drop this off for you again.

01:31.383 --> 01:33.677
Ida-Mae Mann? Aw!

01:33.677 --> 01:36.555
Isn't that that lonely little lady
that sits up in her window?

01:36.555 --> 01:39.183
He always makes me deliver his
neighborhood association stuff

01:39.183 --> 01:40.350
because he's afraid of her.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.518
That's crazy.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.353
I go by that house all the time.

01:46.190 --> 01:47.274
Not hot, Phil.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.069
Fine. She's creepy.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.697
She sits in that window like a store cat.

01:53.697 --> 01:56.241
Okay, I'll drop it off
on the way to dinner with Bill.

01:56.325 --> 01:58.160
He's taking me to Buon Cibo's at 6:00.
Whoa.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.537
I'm going to Buon Cibo's
at 6:00 with Janice.

02:00.621 --> 02:03.707
Ew! I don't wanna watch you
run your discount body spray game on her.

02:03.707 --> 02:05.000
Change your reservation to later.

02:05.000 --> 02:08.504
I can't. She has to eat four
hours before bed because of the reflux.

02:08.504 --> 02:09.588
You change.

02:09.588 --> 02:12.341
No. We're going out after to see
<i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre,</i>

02:12.341 --> 02:14.009
which I can't believe I agreed to.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.762
Ooh! That sounds like fun.
I've never seen that movie.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.639
Can you believe that? Me, of all people.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.140
Uh, then we're going.

02:20.224 --> 02:21.975
You think you can't be scared anymore?

02:22.059 --> 02:24.311
That's the most terrifying
movie I've ever seen.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.189
Great. Bring it.
I look forward to being scared.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.899
I'm pregnant?

02:29.316 --> 02:30.317
Phil.

02:35.197 --> 02:36.281
Oh, did you get the costumes?

02:36.365 --> 02:38.075
Yeah, I... I didn't have a lot of time,

02:38.075 --> 02:40.077
so I had to steal something from work.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.245
Please don't...

02:41.787 --> 02:42.788
...judge.

02:42.788 --> 02:45.123
Okay. That's not a bad start, I think.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.251
I can work with this, yes.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.086
Lily, my pins.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.547
We are so excited for Halloween.

02:51.547 --> 02:53.757
For the first time in years,
we're gonna get a little cray

02:53.841 --> 02:56.051
and go to the Big Gay Halloween Carnival

02:56.051 --> 02:58.428
like we used to when we were
young and childless.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.055
And people still said "cray."

03:00.055 --> 03:03.058
We've always had Lily with us in the past,

03:03.058 --> 03:05.769
but we are on a crusade
to make her more independent,

03:05.853 --> 03:08.939
so when she got an invite to a party,
we sort of, uh...

03:08.939 --> 03:10.524
- RSVP'd for her.
- Yeah.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.608
But you know what, it's gonna be

03:11.692 --> 03:12.693
- good for her to socialize...
- Mmm.

03:12.693 --> 03:15.445
...with people her age,
and good for us to socialize with

03:15.529 --> 03:16.989
- people half our age.
- People half our age.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.073
Okay.

03:18.615 --> 03:22.035
- Mitchell, Judge... Judy.
- Mmm.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.830
Your talent, it's like
you were touched by a gay-ngel.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.833
And you said we would
never wear the groomsmen shoes

03:27.833 --> 03:29.251
from Pepper's wedding again.
Mmm-hmm.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.544
Mmm-hmm...

03:31.503 --> 03:33.172
Whoa! Just a second, young lady.

03:33.172 --> 03:35.090
We're very happy
you're going to this party tonight,

03:35.174 --> 03:38.135
but, uh, isn't this costume
a little, uh, suggestive?

03:38.135 --> 03:40.345
This is my actual cheerleading outfit.

03:40.804 --> 03:42.598
You guys know I'm doing that, right?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.266
- Yeah. Totally.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.434
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Totally.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.768
- We should've known that, right?
- Oh!

03:48.770 --> 03:50.647
Oh, Joe, you're home early?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.065
I got a surprise for... Oh...

03:52.441 --> 03:53.442
Manny.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.319
Look, I know you breastfed
until you could stand,

03:55.319 --> 03:57.154
but aren't you a little old
to be trick-or-treating?

03:57.154 --> 03:58.238
This isn't for Halloween.

03:58.322 --> 04:00.616
I'm in final rehearsals
for my one-man show,

04:00.616 --> 04:02.910
<i>Sigmund Freud, Here Ego Again.</i>

04:03.452 --> 04:04.995
I've saved you four seats,
but if you need more...

04:04.995 --> 04:06.079
No, four's good.

04:06.163 --> 04:08.415
- So what's the surprise?
- Well, it's kind of a Joe thing.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.834
You know, he's out
trick-or-treating with his friends.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.919
I'll wait till he comes home

04:11.919 --> 04:13.378
- to show it to him.
- Hmm.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.255
Playing favorites with your sons.

04:15.339 --> 04:18.217
Perhaps unconsciously repeating the cycle
your own father perpetrated...

04:18.217 --> 04:20.052
You know,
one ticket's gonna be good enough.

04:20.761 --> 04:25.933
Is it cold in here or is it just me,
because I am the frozen lady from <i>Frozen?</i>

04:26.350 --> 04:28.101
Why aren't you wearing your costume?

04:28.185 --> 04:30.062
Let it go, Gloria, let it go.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.606
But you said that since
Joe was out with Dave's family,

04:32.606 --> 04:34.816
that we were going to do
something fun together.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.735
Yes, fun. Have a Scotch,

04:37.110 --> 04:39.571
put that mutant spider costume on Stella.

04:39.655 --> 04:42.574
Fine. I'll go meet
Mitch and Cam by myself.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.992
But you're gonna miss Joe's reaction

04:44.076 --> 04:45.410
when I give him my big surprise.

04:45.494 --> 04:47.204
It's just a candy bar!

04:47.996 --> 04:51.083
Eighteen months ago,
in an under-reported news event,

04:51.083 --> 04:56.046
Naga Snacky Food Solutions discontinued
the greatest candy bar of all time.

04:56.505 --> 04:57.589
The Fudgy Duddy.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.842
After an exhaustive search...

04:59.842 --> 05:01.051
One googling.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.345
...I tracked down this beauty.

05:04.054 --> 05:08.058
Now my son can experience
the kind of quality confection

05:08.058 --> 05:09.852
our generation grew up with.

05:09.852 --> 05:10.936
"Our"?

05:10.936 --> 05:13.480
I am a Gen X. Don't make me a boomer.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.984
Something horrible
happened to me last weekend.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.403
I'll just have the...

05:19.695 --> 05:21.238
- Seafood salad.
- Very good.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.865
And for your husband?

05:23.073 --> 05:24.950
No, he's my husband.

05:24.950 --> 05:26.034
That's what he said.

05:26.702 --> 05:29.121
<i>The day I have dreaded finally came.</i>

05:29.454 --> 05:31.874
People assume that I am Jay's...

05:33.208 --> 05:34.209
...wife.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.003
You kids have fun.

05:36.253 --> 05:37.588
Manny, what are you doing?

05:38.088 --> 05:40.507
Saving your house from being egged.
You're all out of treats.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.134
Luckily I found a candy bar to give away.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.761
Oh no, my Fudgy Duddy's gone!

05:45.220 --> 05:46.638
Nobody move!

05:48.223 --> 05:52.519
Hello there.
Uh, two for <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</i>

05:52.603 --> 05:54.396
Sorry, that sold out weeks ago.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.649
Which should've been updated
on our website, Bernard.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.571
But we still have seats
for that super scary Japanese film.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.947
- Yes!
- Uh, pause.

06:04.239 --> 06:05.240
How scary?

06:05.324 --> 06:06.366
How Japanese?

06:06.450 --> 06:11.038
I think the literal translation
is <i>Make Dead with Old Face Baby.</i>

06:11.038 --> 06:12.289
- Two, please.
- No...

06:12.289 --> 06:13.373
Come on, honey.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.542
You promised me a good scare.
This'll be fun.

06:15.626 --> 06:16.877
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.420
No!

06:20.756 --> 06:21.757
How you doing?

06:22.216 --> 06:24.009
Great. I'm so scared.

06:25.219 --> 06:26.470
Don't patronize me.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.639
You don't think I can tell
when you're faking it?

06:28.805 --> 06:31.558
"Oh, Phil. Mmm. So good."

06:31.642 --> 06:33.060
I know you hated my gumbo.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.856
Excuse me. Hey. Uh...

06:38.023 --> 06:39.358
I'm having a hard time in there.

06:39.358 --> 06:41.068
I came to see a movie
I'd already seen,

06:41.068 --> 06:43.445
knew where all the jump scares were.

06:43.654 --> 06:46.490
Could you tell me
where the big ones are for this one?

06:46.490 --> 06:47.658
Sorry, dude. Haven't seen it.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.911
- I have.
- Oh, God!

06:53.747 --> 06:54.748
It's okay.

06:55.290 --> 06:56.291
He's behind the door.

06:57.251 --> 06:58.252
He's behind the door.

06:58.794 --> 06:59.795
He's behind the...

07:03.382 --> 07:05.425
Something is wrong with you!

07:07.344 --> 07:08.846
This place has changed. Yeah.

07:09.096 --> 07:10.472
It used to be so much...

07:11.348 --> 07:12.349
...gay-er.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.684
Straight people
always take our best stuff.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.561
First they came for our brunches,

07:15.561 --> 07:16.645
and I said nothing.

07:16.645 --> 07:18.647
Oh, hey, Norm. Hey, Denise.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.274
Hey, girlfriends.

07:20.274 --> 07:22.234
I don't think we can say that.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.318
You can't. Yeah.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.696
Wait,
isn't Lily at a party at your house...

07:25.696 --> 07:27.406
- Yeah.
- ...that you're chaperoning?

07:27.406 --> 07:29.867
That was the plan,
but then a bunch of older kids showed up.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.493
So we figured they'd be fine.

07:31.702 --> 07:32.870
Bye, bitches!

07:33.537 --> 07:34.830
It's okay, I'm a girl.

07:35.289 --> 07:37.165
Older kids, no adults.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.917
Okay, where are we on the panic scale?

07:39.418 --> 07:40.627
There you are.

07:40.711 --> 07:43.797
Thank you for saving me
from a night of listening to Jay

07:43.881 --> 07:45.799
talk about his Fudgy Body.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.927
I'm sorry, we just found out
Lily is at an unsupervised party.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.388
Oh, do you want me to check her Insta?

07:52.097 --> 07:53.432
Lily has Insta?

07:53.432 --> 07:54.516
You have Insta?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.810
What, you think I'm too old to have Insta?

07:56.894 --> 07:59.021
Okay, I wanna hear all about
what you're going through

07:59.021 --> 08:00.814
- right after we figure out...
- I found her!

08:00.898 --> 08:02.024
Okay.

08:02.024 --> 08:03.817
Looks like she's having fun. Okay.

08:03.901 --> 08:06.195
Who is this cute boy next to her?
Can you turn it...

08:06.904 --> 08:09.156
Okay, that's Garth.
I've never trusted him.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.866
I saw him buying deodorant
when he was nine.

08:10.866 --> 08:12.367
Is that a beer?

08:12.701 --> 08:14.161
- Okay...
- Don't just stand there.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.746
- I'm going to call her!
- Call her!

08:15.871 --> 08:16.914
<i>Ay.</i>

08:16.914 --> 08:19.958
I didn't think
it was gonna be so cold tonight.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.835
I'm sorry if I seem off,

08:21.919 --> 08:25.589
it's just that, lately, people
have been mistaking me for a much older...

08:27.466 --> 08:29.009
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you lost?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.469
I can't find my friends.

08:30.469 --> 08:32.387
- Well, let me help you.
- Ah.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.847
What a nice young man.

08:39.353 --> 08:40.354
Get off me.

08:41.396 --> 08:42.731
Perhaps this candy bar represents

08:42.731 --> 08:43.815
your lost innocence?

08:43.899 --> 08:45.442
It represents delicious chocolate.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.236
You're sure you gave this to a Spider-Man?

08:47.236 --> 08:49.530
I'm sure.
You know, it's also hard to ignore

08:49.530 --> 08:51.573
that this object you seek
has a phallic shape.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.700
Why did I talk you out of that mime major!

08:53.951 --> 08:54.952
Spidey, eleven o'clock.

08:55.410 --> 08:56.912
Spider-Man, hold up.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.330
I'm not Spider-Man, okay?

08:58.330 --> 09:00.999
I'm Deadpool.
It's a totally different character.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.545
Look, before I realized
it was a symbol of this man's mortality,

09:04.545 --> 09:06.296
I accidentally gave you some candy bar.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.298
Not "some candy bar." A Fudgy Duddy.

09:08.382 --> 09:10.175
Look, you kids should know about this.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.427
There was a famous commercial
back in the '70s.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.847
First time on TV
a girl touched a baseball.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.765
It's got a red-and-blue wrapper with a...

09:16.849 --> 09:19.268
Oh, yeah. I remember.
It looked gross so I gave it to my mom.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.812
She just left to go to that
festival in West Hollywood.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.439
- Describe her.
- She's kind of shy, loves animals...

09:24.523 --> 09:25.899
No, her costume.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.776
Oh, she's dressed as Martha Stewart.

09:28.318 --> 09:30.445
Ironic, since I had cereal for dinner.

09:30.529 --> 09:31.530
Come with me, I need you.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.365
- For emotional support?
- Carpool lane.

09:35.993 --> 09:39.663
I hope this doesn't sound too mushy,
but I really love hooking up with you.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.292
Well, I hate to think I'm pulling you away
from some Halloween fun, you know,

09:43.292 --> 09:45.961
partying with your more youthful friends.

09:45.961 --> 09:47.296
Hush, silly Janice.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.506
If I was interested in youthful things,

09:50.048 --> 09:51.300
would I be here with you?

09:52.176 --> 09:55.721
Oh, babe, you have no idea
how much I've missed you.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.764
I think I have some idea.

09:58.557 --> 10:01.059
Bill's been away fighting
a forest fire for weeks.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.978
He called me once to say he missed me,

10:02.978 --> 10:05.105
so I sent him a pic
of me in a cute outfit.

10:05.564 --> 10:08.275
I expected "Wow!" or a fire emoji.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.444
Instead, I got...

10:10.694 --> 10:12.613
"Send more boobs."

10:12.613 --> 10:16.575
I'm not mad, but I don't wanna
make it a habit of sending nudes.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.660
Wait, you actually sent boob pics?

10:18.744 --> 10:20.996
Yeah, how much smoke did you inhale?

10:20.996 --> 10:22.456
This isn't my number, Alex.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.249
It's the one you called from.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.584
Because my phone died.

10:25.584 --> 10:27.252
So I borrowed Creepy Craig's.

10:27.419 --> 10:31.215
Wait, you sent Creepy Craig a naked photo?

10:31.381 --> 10:32.382
Alex!

10:32.925 --> 10:35.427
Oh, my God. There's, like, 11?

10:35.511 --> 10:36.803
Well, you...

10:37.137 --> 10:38.597
He kept asking.

10:38.597 --> 10:41.016
You think I'm as pervy as Creepy Craig?

10:41.016 --> 10:42.309
I don't know Creepy Craig!

10:42.309 --> 10:44.353
Well, he knows you.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.897
You really think I would
disrespect you like that?

10:47.314 --> 10:48.690
What else did "I" ask for?

10:48.774 --> 10:51.693
- Oh, don't.
- Oh, my God. Are you outside?

10:52.277 --> 10:55.405
You know, I've always worried that maybe
we were just too different, but...

10:55.948 --> 10:59.743
the fact that you think
I'm capable of writing, "Do butt now,"

11:00.077 --> 11:01.662
"Hit with magazine"?

11:02.246 --> 11:03.247
You know what?

11:03.914 --> 11:05.165
This isn't working, Alex.

11:05.499 --> 11:06.625
Bill, wait.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.377
Can you at least ask Craig
to delete those?

11:08.377 --> 11:09.878
I think you know how to reach him.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.841
Trust me, I've had enough
Halloween mischief for one lifetime.

11:14.258 --> 11:15.384
I'm ready for this now.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.302
You are such a mature person.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.055
I can't even imagine you as a wild child.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.850
Oh, yeah. Five years ago,
we hit this one house.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.769
The family was always calling the cops
on us for lighting out fireworks.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.020
Mmm.
Standard stuff.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.897
TP, sugar in the gas tank.

11:28.981 --> 11:32.317
But then, I noticed they had,
like, 20 of those stupid garden gnomes.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.611
- Oh, my God.
- I know, so douchey.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.905
So, we posed them having sex,

11:36.989 --> 11:39.700
rang the doorbell,
and then when they opened the door,

11:39.700 --> 11:41.702
we blew them up.

11:43.453 --> 11:44.746
Are you not getting it?

11:44.913 --> 11:46.331
It's kind of subtle, so...

11:46.415 --> 11:47.916
That was my house.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.127
But you live in a condo.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.211
Now.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.256
Years ago, my husband's father died

11:54.256 --> 11:57.050
and left us his antique gnome collection.

11:57.301 --> 12:01.138
Marty wanted to keep them in the house.
They soothed him, he said.

12:01.138 --> 12:06.101
'Cause the constant fireworks
were always triggering his PTSD.

12:06.518 --> 12:10.564
So I insisted he put
his sole inheritance outside

12:10.564 --> 12:12.983
where you blew them up.

12:13.817 --> 12:14.818
Life's funny.

12:15.485 --> 12:16.486
Yeah.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.907
Yeah. The next day I was supposed
to meet him at couples' therapy

12:20.741 --> 12:23.744
but I didn't make it 'cause my car died.
Sugar in the tank.

12:24.328 --> 12:28.248
So I missed the appointment,
he went for coffee,

12:28.332 --> 12:30.375
fell in love with the barista,

12:30.459 --> 12:34.630
and now I am living in a condo,
dating a frigging child.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.799
Janice, this might be
a bad time to mention it, but...

12:38.383 --> 12:40.135
I don't have enough money for the valet.

12:48.101 --> 12:51.313
Lily is still not answering.
Did you track her location?

12:51.313 --> 12:53.357
Uh, yeah, it says that she's at our house.

12:53.357 --> 12:54.942
Do you think she took that boy home?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.485
Of course she did.

12:56.902 --> 12:59.655
An empty house,
all those Anita Baker records.

12:59.655 --> 13:02.449
It's the sexiest place in town.
We have to get home.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.243
Okay, it's gonna
take us an hour just to get out of here.

13:04.243 --> 13:07.454
No, we can save ourselves 20 minutes
just by cutting through this maze.

13:07.538 --> 13:09.456
No, no. I... I hate those things.

13:09.540 --> 13:13.377
Mitchell, we basically forced our daughter
into the arms of a hormonal teen,

13:13.377 --> 13:14.461
and, let's be honest...

13:14.837 --> 13:17.923
Was it because we wanted more
independence for her or for us?

13:22.344 --> 13:23.345
All right.

13:23.554 --> 13:26.890
Now, try to have some backbone.
I'm... I'm right here.

13:27.516 --> 13:28.517
Okay?

13:28.517 --> 13:31.061
Just remember, this is for our daughter.

13:34.606 --> 13:35.691
Cam!

13:38.235 --> 13:42.197
I know it makes me seem shallow,
but he had such a crazy body.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.408
How am I supposed
to go back to nerd butts?

13:44.533 --> 13:47.411
No matter what I'd need,
it'd be right there in her purse.

13:47.995 --> 13:51.498
Band-Aids, wet wipes, raisins.

13:51.582 --> 13:54.376
Because sometimes I'm not angry,
I'm just hungry.

13:54.751 --> 13:56.712
You know what she's not gonna
find in that purse?

13:56.920 --> 13:58.172
Someone better than you.

13:58.172 --> 14:00.799
- Really?
- Yeah. You can do better than...

14:01.258 --> 14:03.302
I'm forgetting her name right now,
so Molly's mom.

14:03.302 --> 14:06.096
You know, I'm not just
saying it because you said it, but,

14:06.555 --> 14:08.348
I never thought
Bill was good enough for you.

14:08.432 --> 14:11.602
- Seriously?
- You deserve someone smart and curious.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.354
Be honest,
didn't you get sick of him saying,

14:14.438 --> 14:15.856
"I bet I can jump over that"

14:15.856 --> 14:17.441
every time he walked outside?

14:18.025 --> 14:19.234
Thanks, Luke.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.694
We don't need them, right?

14:20.694 --> 14:23.155
In a couple of weeks,
we won't remember either one of them.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.200
A fireman?

14:27.034 --> 14:28.035
A nun?

14:29.786 --> 14:31.663
Janice was into some really weird stuff.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.086
Now what about her?
Is that a Martha Stewart?

14:38.253 --> 14:39.671
I think that's Princess Di.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.548
Jay, you have to prepare yourself.

14:41.632 --> 14:43.300
We may not find your candy bar.

14:43.300 --> 14:46.220
We've stopped four Martha Stewarts,
two Dog the Bounty Hunters,

14:46.220 --> 14:48.388
and the real Judith Light.
How nice was she, by the way?

14:48.472 --> 14:50.015
Yeah, yeah. Class act. Keep looking.

14:51.475 --> 14:52.643
Hey, that's Mom.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.478
- Mom!
- Manny!

14:54.478 --> 14:55.812
How many times have I told you

14:55.896 --> 14:58.232
not to shout "Mom"
when you're dressed like an old man.

14:58.232 --> 14:59.816
Including now, once.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.069
I'm sorry. I'm not mad at you.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.863
I'm mad at Mitch and Cam
for leaving me here,

15:04.947 --> 15:08.200
and that mean Boy Scout
that made me feel so old.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.409
Old?

15:09.660 --> 15:11.537
Sweetie, you look delicious.

15:11.537 --> 15:12.788
- I do?
- Yes.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.332
- You're dancing with us right now.
- Okay.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.126
Whoa.

15:18.919 --> 15:20.379
Look what I found on the ground.

15:22.047 --> 15:23.090
We're too late.

15:23.507 --> 15:24.675
Sorry, Jay.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.635
Do you wanna talk about it?

15:26.635 --> 15:29.012
No! I don't wanna seem like a sad sack.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.100
Excuse me.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.811
What is it about this candy?

15:35.811 --> 15:38.856
It just tasted like summer or something,
I don't know.

15:39.314 --> 15:40.983
Out with the old, in with the new.

15:40.983 --> 15:42.484
Candy bars come and go.

15:43.527 --> 15:45.112
No more record stores.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.948
Six-year-old sons too grown up

15:47.948 --> 15:49.575
to go trick-or-treating with their dads.

15:50.701 --> 15:51.827
No more beepers.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.830
Are you that bummed that
Joe didn't wanna spend Halloween with you?

15:54.830 --> 15:57.165
No, it's just the beginning
of the whole thing, you know,

15:57.249 --> 15:58.876
when you break that seal.

15:59.251 --> 16:02.129
Look, I know Joe wanted to be
with his friends tonight, but,

16:02.129 --> 16:04.756
he'll definitely wanna spend
another Halloween with his dad.

16:04.840 --> 16:05.841
How do you know that?

16:05.841 --> 16:07.259
Kids have a way of coming back.

16:08.427 --> 16:11.388
Even if they have to make up
a dumb reason to do it.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.270
Happy Halloween, kid.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.607
Wait, this is a delicate moment.

16:21.773 --> 16:23.942
We could scar her
if we don't handle it right.

16:24.026 --> 16:25.903
Oh, God, I know that's true.

16:26.612 --> 16:30.032
My first kiss was terrible.
My mom walked in on me with this girl.

16:30.032 --> 16:33.202
I can still hear my mom scream to my dad,
"I told you he wasn't!"

16:33.202 --> 16:35.329
- Well, mine was worse.
- It's not a competition.

16:35.329 --> 16:38.081
My dad found me in a barn
open-mouthed kissing a tackling dummy.

16:38.665 --> 16:41.627
And you win. Okay, so, gentle, but firm.

16:42.211 --> 16:43.212
- Okay?
- Yeah.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.843
Sweetie, is everything okay?

16:50.636 --> 16:51.678
It's nothing.

16:51.887 --> 16:52.888
Go away.

16:52.888 --> 16:56.934
Honey, did a boy pressure you
to do something you didn't wanna do?

16:56.934 --> 16:59.102
Ew! Gross. No.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.772
Did a girl pressure you
into doing something...

17:01.772 --> 17:05.317
Oh, my God. Can you adopt a second child
to take some of this off of me?

17:05.317 --> 17:08.487
Honey, we just wanna help, okay?

17:08.737 --> 17:10.614
We're afraid that maybe we pushed you

17:10.614 --> 17:12.699
into going to that party
before you were ready.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.244
Look, I thought this boy really liked me,

17:15.244 --> 17:17.496
but he was just using me
to get to my friend Kelly.

17:17.496 --> 17:19.498
- Kelly? Ew! She's gross.
- Yeah.

17:19.498 --> 17:21.208
No, she isn't. She's my friend. Okay.

17:21.208 --> 17:23.377
Well, she's not you,
and anyone who would pick her...

17:23.377 --> 17:25.087
Of course you'd say that. You're my dad.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.923
I'm sorry, there's nothing that
you could say that would help.

17:28.382 --> 17:29.383
Okay?

17:29.383 --> 17:31.260
You're not a girl, you're not 12.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.429
What would you know about liking
a boy who doesn't like you back?

17:35.138 --> 17:36.473
Oh, honey.

17:36.557 --> 17:38.058
- I'm gonna get us some ice cream.
- Okay.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.935
Come here. Come here. Okay.

17:40.811 --> 17:43.814
Honey, you can't be mad that
I wasn't scared by that movie.

17:43.814 --> 17:46.525
- It was a baby.
- It had three rows of teeth.

17:46.525 --> 17:47.609
Baby teeth.

17:47.693 --> 17:50.779
Look, it's not your fault. It's just that,
next to you, I feel like such a wuss.

17:50.863 --> 17:52.322
Just because you get
a little bit squirrely

17:52.406 --> 17:53.866
in a movie doesn't make you... Wait.

17:53.866 --> 17:55.993
Hang on. Why are we crossing the street?
Our house is right down...

17:56.159 --> 17:58.495
Wait a minute, you're not afraid
of the little old lady's house, are you?

17:58.579 --> 17:59.830
You don't know she's little.

17:59.830 --> 18:01.164
All we know is she sits up there,

18:01.248 --> 18:02.499
plotting evil from her window.

18:02.583 --> 18:04.877
She's not there. She's always there!

18:04.877 --> 18:06.044
This stops now.

18:06.128 --> 18:09.006
We're gonna go knock on that door,
introduce ourselves,

18:09.006 --> 18:11.842
and put an end to this nuttiness.

18:19.349 --> 18:20.350
Huh.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.478
- That's weird timing.
- The...

18:23.812 --> 18:25.230
The envelope Alex dropped off,

18:25.314 --> 18:26.940
the old lady never picked it up.

18:27.482 --> 18:28.734
What was that?

18:28.734 --> 18:30.944
Oh, God. Phil, what if she fell?
We should go check on her.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.029
Yeah, I guess so.

18:32.487 --> 18:35.324
I'm right behind you.
I'm just gonna go find a flashlight.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.783
Phil...

18:42.247 --> 18:43.498
Um...

18:44.208 --> 18:45.209
Hello?

18:47.085 --> 18:48.086
Ms. Mann?

18:50.464 --> 18:51.465
Hello?

18:58.305 --> 18:59.306
Ida-Mae?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.227
Oh.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.646
Ida-Mae?

19:11.860 --> 19:12.861
Ms. Mann?

19:19.076 --> 19:21.745
It was simplicity itself.

19:22.246 --> 19:25.082
A year ago,
Claire accused me for the millionth time

19:25.082 --> 19:26.250
that I couldn't scare her, so,

19:26.667 --> 19:27.668
I came up with a plan.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.711
<i>I just sold a house to a European couple</i>

19:29.795 --> 19:31.672
<i>that weren't gonna take
possession for a while.</i>

19:31.672 --> 19:34.800
<i>So, uh, last fall, Ida-Mae moved in.</i>

19:34.800 --> 19:37.469
I told you, she's always up there.

19:37.886 --> 19:40.973
<i>Fortunately, the house
was right on Claire's</i><i>jogging route,</i>

19:40.973 --> 19:43.433
<i>so it was easy
to introduce Claire to Ida-Mae,</i>

19:43.767 --> 19:46.395
and when I wanted to amp it up...

19:47.229 --> 19:49.606
<i>I had Ida-Mae make contact.</i>

19:53.235 --> 19:54.236
Hey!

19:54.486 --> 19:55.988
Then, this morning...

19:56.446 --> 19:58.240
<i>I knew that ax wouldn't scare Claire.</i>

19:58.240 --> 20:00.826
<i>I just did that so she'd accuse me
of not being able to scare her.</i>

20:00.826 --> 20:02.244
It's all about plausibility.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.829
Damn right it is!

20:03.829 --> 20:07.332
Over the past year, Ida-Mae joined
the neighborhood association,

20:07.416 --> 20:09.084
hung up a poster for a lost dog,

20:09.168 --> 20:11.628
signed up for Meals On Wheels,
they're not bad, by the way.

20:11.712 --> 20:12.713
Also...

20:13.213 --> 20:14.548
She got a lot of knitting done.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.052
I'm sorry, Claire.

20:19.136 --> 20:20.846
Did I scare you?

20:20.846 --> 20:21.972
You did this?

20:21.972 --> 20:23.432
- Yep.
- How long did you plan this?

20:23.432 --> 20:25.350
Eleven months, two weeks,
and three days ago,

20:25.434 --> 20:28.604
I gave birth to Ida-Mae Mann
because "I da main man."

20:28.729 --> 20:31.148
- Don't you dare do wordplay, Phil.
- Sorry.

20:31.148 --> 20:33.817
- I was having so much fun!
- What?

20:33.901 --> 20:36.778
I was wondering what we were gonna do
for the next 30 years of our lives

20:36.862 --> 20:39.031
without the kids in the house,
and now I know.

20:39.323 --> 20:41.783
You're getting twisted, and I like it.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.327
Game on.

20:43.327 --> 20:44.620
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

20:44.620 --> 20:46.413
Game on? What do you mean, game on?

20:46.705 --> 20:48.415
- It's game over.
- Nope.

20:49.708 --> 20:50.918
Watch your back, buddy.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.170
This is gonna be so much fun.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.923
Can't we just travel?

20:58.759 --> 20:59.843
Where'd your mom go?

21:00.219 --> 21:02.387
<i>We have a winner.</i>

21:04.556 --> 21:06.600
I really needed this today.

21:11.563 --> 21:14.316
Excuse me. Hey, that's my wife!

21:14.316 --> 21:17.486
Oh, sure, sweetheart.
Like you could get that.

21:17.486 --> 21:19.780
No, no, no. That is my husband.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.073
Huh?

21:21.073 --> 21:23.492
- Does she know that...
- No, and we're never gonna tell her.
