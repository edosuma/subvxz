00:08.384 --> 00:11.046
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Nothing. Sleeping.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.597
-Did you touch me?
-Hell no, I swear.

00:14.098 --> 00:17.181
Sookie, listen. Bill asked me
to look after you while he was away.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.263
-Did he ask you to do it buck-naked?
-No,no.

00:20.438 --> 00:23.601
-I want you out of here. Now.
-Listen, listen, Sookie.

00:23.774 --> 00:27.483
I need to tell you something about me,
something I've never told another person.

00:27.653 --> 00:31.237
Oh, my God, it's you.
You're the murderer.

00:31.407 --> 00:34.774
-No, no, Sookie--
-Oh, my God, you killed my grandmother.

01:04.357 --> 01:06.143
I'm not the killer, I swear.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.604
I'm a shape-shifter.

01:12.240 --> 01:14.777
Shut the fuck up.

02:51.172 --> 02:52.958
What's that for?

02:53.924 --> 02:56.381
-Give me your hand.
-Why?

02:56.552 --> 02:59.635
"Why, why, why?
Why's it have to be in the woods?

02:59.805 --> 03:04.674
Why's it have to be before dawn?
Why 799.95?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.808
Why, why, why?"

03:06.979 --> 03:10.096
You think knowing the answers
will save you?

03:10.274 --> 03:12.105
Shut up and give me your hand.

03:14.278 --> 03:15.609
You nasty bitch.

03:15.780 --> 03:19.238
That's cleaner than anything
you've ever touched.

03:21.869 --> 03:25.202
Hold it over the fire. Keep it there.

03:27.124 --> 03:30.241
Angelica root and spit.

03:31.045 --> 03:38.008
A lot stronger than holy water.
You got poison oozing out your pores.

03:38.344 --> 03:41.336
-You live near a highway?
-No.

03:41.514 --> 03:43.800
Cook with a microwave
or talk on a cell phone?

03:43.974 --> 03:46.716
-Who doesn't?
-I don't.

03:46.977 --> 03:51.220
All that pollution and technology,
that's how demons travel.

03:51.482 --> 03:57.102
That's why I stay away out here
in the woods, away from civilization.

03:57.863 --> 04:01.151
-Rub it on your face.
-Are you serious?

04:01.450 --> 04:04.157
You make sure to get around your eyes.

04:04.328 --> 04:07.491
That's the demon's doon/vays.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.502
Drink.

04:22.096 --> 04:24.712
-Jesus, what the hell is it?
-Snake juice.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.505
-lt's made from snakes?
-No.

04:26.684 --> 04:32.304
It snakes down in you,
coils around that evil and rips it out.

04:32.481 --> 04:36.474
All of it. Every last drop.

04:49.832 --> 04:51.322
-Jason?
-If I were you...

04:51.500 --> 04:53.877
...l'd get my filthy mind off of him.

04:55.254 --> 04:57.540
What is it that you vampires say?

04:57.715 --> 04:59.205
"Jason is mine."

05:00.509 --> 05:04.218
It's not like that. He's a good person.

05:04.388 --> 05:07.755
-Are you implying that I'm not?
-Well....

05:07.933 --> 05:11.596
Jason isn't planning to kill me
after I'm no longer any use to him.

05:11.770 --> 05:15.103
Sophomore year of college, I walked away
from an academic scholarship...

05:15.274 --> 05:20.394
...so I could go to this Guatemalan village,
help build their first irrigation system...

05:20.571 --> 05:23.938
...so they could have fresh water,
crops that didn't give them dysentery.

05:24.116 --> 05:28.029
So don't you dare
get morally superior on me.

05:28.204 --> 05:32.197
I am an organic vegan,
and my carbon footprint is miniscule.

05:33.000 --> 05:37.369
Because I know that, ultimately,
we're all just a single living being.

05:38.047 --> 05:40.038
But you are not.

05:41.050 --> 05:44.213
-What the hell?
-You got a clot forming.

05:45.763 --> 05:47.094
There.

05:49.433 --> 05:54.018
Okay, I need tape
to keep it at that angle.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.111
Jason,Jason,Jason.

06:06.617 --> 06:09.279
l was half dead. He only tried to help.

06:09.453 --> 06:13.196
He should've told me about this.
Why wouldn't he tell me about this?

06:13.374 --> 06:15.160
I won't tell him if you won't.

06:15.334 --> 06:19.247
Withholding is tantamount to lying,
and I can't have that in our relationship.

06:19.421 --> 06:21.798
This is so beneath us.

06:22.258 --> 06:27.218
Jason loves you.
He never cared about anyone before.

06:27.721 --> 06:32.636
-He even thinks that you might be the one.
-You talk about me with him?

06:35.229 --> 06:38.972
And he said that? He said that
he thinks that I might be the one?

06:39.149 --> 06:44.644
Amy, if I die here,
Jason will never forgive you...

06:44.822 --> 06:46.983
...even if he wanted to.

06:47.157 --> 06:51.400
-He's not as evolved as you are.
-I know.

06:53.664 --> 06:54.870
A shape-shifter?

06:55.332 --> 06:57.709
Most of us refer to ourselves
simply as shifters.

06:57.876 --> 07:00.083
Well, how many of you are there?

07:00.879 --> 07:04.997
Thousands, tens of thousands, maybe.
We don't exactly have a newsletter.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.133
Do you come from, like,
a family of shifters or something?

07:08.304 --> 07:12.217
lt's hereditary, so yeah, I suppose.

07:13.559 --> 07:17.472
But...l was adopted.

07:18.230 --> 07:21.188
And the family that took me in....

07:22.776 --> 07:24.892
We just never talked about it.

07:26.447 --> 07:29.655
Can you turn into anything,
like cats, birds?

07:29.825 --> 07:31.611
Cats, sure.

07:32.453 --> 07:35.411
Yeah, I can do bird, but flying's hard.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.952
Dog's the easiest for me.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.869
People like dogs.
Most other animals leave you alone.

07:43.047 --> 07:47.290
| used to scratch your belly
in the parking lot at the bar.

07:48.802 --> 07:51.384
That wasn't me, that was a real dog.

07:52.139 --> 07:58.055
I need a live animal in order to shift.
You know, as a model.

07:58.562 --> 08:03.397
-Kind of like an imprint.
-Can you turn into another person?

08:06.111 --> 08:11.526
Humans are too complex.
Despite what you might see at the bar.

08:12.242 --> 08:16.736
-Can you do it any time, or what?
-Yeah.

08:17.247 --> 08:20.410
Yeah, but it wears off if I fall asleep.

08:20.584 --> 08:22.950
And on a full moon,
I can't stop the shift.

08:23.128 --> 08:26.712
-Like a werewolf.
-We're not werewolves.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.333
Hey, werewolves are dangerous,
nasty creatures.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.251
Do not call me a werewolf.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.095
Werewolves exist too?

08:42.272 --> 08:43.603
What else is there?

08:47.778 --> 08:50.520
More than you could imagine.

09:10.092 --> 09:11.673
I can't....

09:13.095 --> 09:16.553
Life is just getting too weird, too fast.

09:19.268 --> 09:21.259
Could a werewolf have killed Gran?

09:23.564 --> 09:26.180
I suppose it's possible.

09:27.317 --> 09:29.774
Oh, my God.
Bill's been dragged off by vampires...

09:29.945 --> 09:32.937
...and now | find out you're something
I never even knew existed.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.030
Don't!

09:46.837 --> 09:50.671
-I thought you would understand.
-Why? Because I'm dating a vampire?

09:50.841 --> 09:54.129
-You know what it's like to live with a secret.
-I don't hide who I am.

09:56.221 --> 09:59.088
I've wanted to tell you for years.

09:59.558 --> 10:01.549
I kissed you.

10:01.727 --> 10:04.639
And I know
you wanted to do more than that.

10:04.855 --> 10:07.767
Were you gonna tell me before or after?

10:15.949 --> 10:20.693
Spit, smoke, root.

10:21.371 --> 10:23.908
Cleanse the body.

10:24.208 --> 10:27.416
Cleanse the soul.

10:27.669 --> 10:32.379
Snake, seek, search, find.

10:33.217 --> 10:35.424
Bring it to the light.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.377
The light.

10:39.848 --> 10:44.387
-Fuck, my stomach.
-lt's angry.

10:44.561 --> 10:48.804
lt's digging its claws so it can hold on.
Don't you fight back.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.065
Let your body be the battleground.

10:52.236 --> 10:54.852
You let that demon destroy itself.

10:56.073 --> 10:59.190
-| feel sick.
-Let it go, let it go.

10:59.368 --> 11:02.405
Let it go. Let go of all that sickness...

11:02.579 --> 11:08.199
...all that rage, all that anger,
all that hate, all that self-pity.

11:08.377 --> 11:11.835
It's just fuel for the demon inside of you.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.256
Fuck.

11:19.304 --> 11:23.468
Come forth, demon.
Leave this child in peace.

11:23.642 --> 11:28.261
Come into the light. Show yourself.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.979
-That ain't real.
-What's there?

11:36.113 --> 11:38.104
Tell me what you see.

11:38.949 --> 11:42.282
It's me standing right over there.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.443
It's me.

11:44.621 --> 11:47.363
The demon will take on any form
to stay alive.

11:47.541 --> 11:51.750
It knows your weaknesses.
It preys on your fears.

11:53.839 --> 11:56.125
Only you can destroy it.

12:20.824 --> 12:24.487
-No, Mama, please, don't hurt me.
-One of you must die.

12:41.720 --> 12:45.679
Good girl. Good girl, good girl.

12:45.849 --> 12:49.683
Good girl. It's all over now.

12:50.646 --> 12:54.685
That demon is gone forever.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.565
You spend more time on your hair
than any man I've ever met.

13:00.739 --> 13:03.401
The trick is to make it look like
you didn't do nothing.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.236
It's harder than it might seem.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.402
I don't think you need
any help looking good, you know it.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.572
I think I might have had
one too many beers last night.

13:11.750 --> 13:15.242
| feel like I been shot at and missed,
shit at and hit.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.251
We need to talk about Eddie.

13:20.884 --> 13:23.591
-Okay.
-Well, I've been thinking.

13:23.762 --> 13:27.596
The way that we've been treating him,
it's just really uncivilized, you know?

13:27.766 --> 13:29.973
Yeah. I do know.

13:30.143 --> 13:31.974
We can't let him go, of course...

13:32.145 --> 13:36.730
...but we can try to make things
just a little bit more comfortable for him.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.562
Do you know what
Stockholm syndrome is?

13:40.028 --> 13:42.485
It's a disease.

13:42.906 --> 13:46.239
Not exactly. It's something
that happens to people who are kidnapped.

13:46.410 --> 13:50.244
It's like, over time, they start
to get closer to their kidnappers.

13:50.414 --> 13:53.747
It's kind of like being part of a family.

13:53.917 --> 13:57.876
-Really?
-All we need to do is make Eddie love us.

14:00.090 --> 14:02.752
And eventually,
we wouldn't have to keep him locked up.

14:02.926 --> 14:05.338
He could just be in the house with us,
like he's--

14:05.512 --> 14:06.922
-Like a pet.
-Yeah.

14:07.097 --> 14:08.928
-And we could travel with him.
-Yeah.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.135
We could sell his blood
when we need money.

14:11.309 --> 14:14.016
And just live out of backpacks
and see the whole world.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.802
We just need boots and a map.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.602
-I ain't never seen snow.
-Tibet.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.984
We can climb the Himalayas.
We can visit the Dalai Lama.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.941
And snowboard naked.

14:25.115 --> 14:28.278
Right, I gotta go to the store.
I wanna get Eddie some Tru Bloods.

14:28.452 --> 14:30.408
Really?

14:30.954 --> 14:32.569
I love you.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.497
-I love you too.
-I love you more.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.506
Oh, my God.

14:46.261 --> 14:49.298
You are even better looking
than you were yesterday.

14:55.645 --> 14:59.183
Mama. Mama, wake up.

15:01.151 --> 15:03.107
Baby, where you been?
I've been so worried.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.984
I had the exorcism.

15:08.158 --> 15:09.614
Tara, are you...?

15:10.494 --> 15:13.827
It worked, Mama. It worked.

15:13.997 --> 15:18.206
Jesus answered my prayers.
We're saved.

15:20.295 --> 15:25.835
Both of us, saved.
You did a brave thing, Tara Mae.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.675
I am so proud of you, my baby.

15:28.845 --> 15:33.509
My whole life, I thought you didn't....
I thought--

15:36.019 --> 15:37.850
I forgive you.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.014
Get dressed.
I'm taking you out to celebrate.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.774
Anywhere you wanna go.

15:46.238 --> 15:48.320
How about Mamaw's Mudbugs
over in Keachi?

15:48.490 --> 15:50.606
-That too far to drive to?
-Are you kidding?

15:50.784 --> 15:52.320
I'd drive anywhere for you.

16:02.546 --> 16:05.379
Sookie, could you reach me up
another box of paper lanterns?

16:05.549 --> 16:08.791
I'm kind of busy right now
setting up your bar.

16:09.219 --> 16:12.586
Thank you, Terry.
You are so sweet and reliable.

16:12.764 --> 16:16.507
I always know what to expect from you.
No nasty surprises.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.392
That's just because
you don't know me very well.

16:22.065 --> 16:26.900
Oh, Sam.
These lanterns are just precious.

16:28.071 --> 16:31.313
But they ought to alternate colors.
Like boy-girl seating.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.231
But they're already in place.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.117
-Oh, it won't take a minute to change.
-All right, Arlene.

16:36.288 --> 16:39.906
Don't you think they should hang
in little scallops, like a gingerbread house?

16:40.083 --> 16:45.498
It'll be more romantic that way,
not like some hick barn dance.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.584
-What do you want it to look like?
-A debutante ball.

16:48.758 --> 16:52.421
Hug your neck.
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

16:52.596 --> 16:55.178
I'll be right back. Thank you, Sam.

16:55.599 --> 16:57.135
How did you know what she wanted?

16:57.309 --> 17:00.847
My cousin Portia was a deb in Shreveport
when she turned 18.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.932
Every Bellefleur woman's been doing it...

17:03.106 --> 17:06.064
...since they started having them
before the Revolutionary War.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.105
It must be nice
to come from such an old family.

17:09.279 --> 17:13.443
All families are old, Sam.
Some just keep better records.

17:17.871 --> 17:20.283
Sam, hush that dog up.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.914
What are you doing
to get him so riled up?

17:24.461 --> 17:28.249
Mitch,
there's something's wrong with Sam.

17:34.179 --> 17:36.044
Lord in heaven.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.301
Sam. Sam.

17:43.480 --> 17:47.098
Don't put the red ones next to
the green ones. This ain't Christmas.

17:47.943 --> 17:50.525
Hey, get that dog out of here.

17:50.946 --> 17:53.904
Don’t shut me out, please.

17:56.826 --> 18:01.365
Georgia,
your replacement just showed up.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.865
"Thought you said
you were gonna get rid of her quick."

18:05.043 --> 18:08.160
Bitch, I love you, you scandalous whore.

18:08.338 --> 18:12.001
Take your man. Take his ass.

18:12.175 --> 18:13.676
--and company.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.676
Shut up. Shut up and get back upstairs.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.589
You better walk down them stairs like:

18:22.811 --> 18:27.054
Oh, I forgot to tell you, Georgia.
I saw the picture--

18:27.399 --> 18:30.311
Well, this an unexpected pleasure.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.859
EEEZ-‘i/E ,1: ~V< /.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.110
I can't stay long.

18:38.285 --> 18:43.245
Boyfriend, I can make you stay longer
than you ever thought you could.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.703
-Actually, I had something else in mind.
-What?

18:46.876 --> 18:51.290
-A little V-juice?
-Sold out.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.467
What? Ain't nothing I can do.

18:57.637 --> 19:02.131
My supplier only comes out after dark,
if you know what I mean.

19:02.309 --> 19:03.924
Damn it.

19:05.061 --> 19:08.849
-I have a speech tonight.
-You got stage fright?

19:09.566 --> 19:10.681
Yeah.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.894
I could help you with that.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.531
You know I can.

19:25.915 --> 19:27.746
I can't mess up my clothes.

19:28.585 --> 19:30.917
I love how Mamaw's Mudbugs
is exactly the same...

19:31.087 --> 19:34.750
...as when we used to go there
when I was little. Remember?

19:35.216 --> 19:38.959
Yeah, until I lost my license.

19:40.597 --> 19:44.181
First thing in the morning,
I'm going down to DMV.

19:46.269 --> 19:47.600
-What's wrong?
-I don't know.

19:47.771 --> 19:51.855
-Maybe one bucket was enough.
-I told you not to suck the heads.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.516
-Oh, good Lord in heaven.
-Hold on.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.857
I'll find us a drug store,
get you some Pepto.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.867
Excuse me.
What aisle's the Pepto-Bismol on?

20:09.042 --> 20:11.203
Aisle 7. Right over there.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.288
I know you.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.127
No, I'm sure you've mistaken me
for someone else.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.212
Miss Jeanette.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.210
No. I'm needed up front, ma'am.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.222
No, I know your face.
Don't run away from me.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.475
-Hey!
-You took advantage of my mama.

20:28.645 --> 20:31.728
-Don't touch me.
-Don't touch you? I ought to kill you, bitch.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.559
-I will call the police.
-Go ahead.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.646
Tell them how you charged me $800
to spit in my face and poison me.

20:37.821 --> 20:40.153
-You know what? I'll call them myself.
-Wait, wait.

20:40.323 --> 20:43.440
What was in that shit you gave me,
that snake juice?

20:44.411 --> 20:47.403
Ipecac syrup and a small amount of peyote.
It's perfectly safe.

20:47.580 --> 20:51.368
I puked my guts out.
I hallucinated stabbing a little girl.

20:51.543 --> 20:54.330
-What the fuck kind of person are you?
-Look.

20:54.504 --> 20:57.337
I got a son in prison,
another one in Iraq.

20:57.507 --> 21:01.591
I got a daughter with diabetes,
and three grandbabies I gotta take care of.

21:01.761 --> 21:06.130
I do what I have to for my family.
Same as you.

21:06.349 --> 21:08.556
I actually believed you had fixed me.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.762
Oh, my God,
I am such a fucking dumb-ass.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.393
Listen.

21:13.314 --> 21:17.273
Just because Miss Jeanette ain't real
doesn't mean she can't help people.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.901
You saw how it worked for your mama.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.028
She still sober?

21:22.198 --> 21:24.814
Once she finds out about you,
she'll be drinking again.

21:24.993 --> 21:26.858
Well, maybe she don't have to find out.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.703
Faith's a powerful thing.

21:32.584 --> 21:36.372
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

21:46.639 --> 21:48.504
-You get something for me?
-They're out.

22:51.788 --> 22:55.246
I'd ask you to dance, but I don't dance.

22:55.416 --> 22:57.907
Thanks anyhow, Terry.

22:58.086 --> 23:02.955
Sometimes, crowds makes me feel guilty
for not having fun like everyone else.

23:03.132 --> 23:05.748
And then I feel guilty for feeling guilty.

23:06.636 --> 23:09.218
Guilt is a useless emotion.

23:10.431 --> 23:12.808
Or so I've heard.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.308
I just wish Bill was here.

23:18.648 --> 23:22.641
There's some dead people
I wish was still around too.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.338
-I want it!
-Me!

23:51.347 --> 23:55.807
Idiot. You fed on a human
that belonged to another.

23:56.352 --> 23:58.809
Three months of starving
till your fangs grow back...

23:58.980 --> 24:01.517
...will teach you better manners.

24:01.691 --> 24:05.730
Brothers and sisters of the tribunal,
is this fair? Is this just?

24:05.903 --> 24:07.404
Yeah.

24:09.032 --> 24:13.867
Now, Luisa, the other one, please.
From the root.

24:29.510 --> 24:35.471
Sentence passed and executed.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.600
The trial is concluded. Best of luck.

24:38.770 --> 24:43.434
Moving on. This looks interesting.

24:43.775 --> 24:48.269
Eric Northman, sheriff of Area 5.

24:48.446 --> 24:51.358
-Magister.
-Well, then.

24:52.575 --> 24:54.406
Bring me your murderer.

25:20.645 --> 25:23.603
It's nice not to have to sneak it to you
no more, ain't it?

25:27.735 --> 25:32.445
-Yeah, it is surprising.
-See? I told you Amy wasn't a psycho.

25:32.615 --> 25:36.904
The more time you spend with us,
you'll see she's an amazing woman.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.610
What made her change her mind?

25:40.123 --> 25:44.332
Well, she wants you to live with us,
like part of the family.

25:44.502 --> 25:45.742
I do too.

25:47.463 --> 25:52.207
She tell you about
finding the Tru Bloods you brought me?

25:55.054 --> 25:56.669
You're lying.

25:58.391 --> 25:59.847
Well, what did she say?

26:00.017 --> 26:03.475
She said that withholding
was tantamount to lying...

26:03.646 --> 26:06.137
...and that your relationship
was better than that.

26:06.441 --> 26:07.897
Fuck.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.901
God, that even sounds like her.

26:12.071 --> 26:15.234
-She's playing you, Jason.
-No, she is not.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.823
Ain't nobody plays Jason Stackhouse.

26:17.994 --> 26:20.781
If you don't let me go,
she's going to kill me.

26:20.955 --> 26:24.413
-She would never do that. She's a--
-Psychopath?

26:24.584 --> 26:28.372
-Jason, we're late.
-Yeah, I'm coming.

26:28.921 --> 26:31.458
Bye-bye, Eddie.
We'll see you in a few hours.

26:31.632 --> 26:34.465
I was thinking we could bring
one of the TVs down here.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.375
Does that sound good?

26:37.847 --> 26:39.462
Come on.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.599
You're wrong about her.

26:50.693 --> 26:51.853
Eddie, where you at?

26:52.028 --> 26:55.987
I'm at your crib. The door was wide open.
This is fucked up as fuck.

26:56.157 --> 26:58.022
Call me when you get this message,
bitch.

27:04.415 --> 27:09.876
Jason fucking Stackhouse,
you bigmouth motherfucker.

27:18.346 --> 27:21.088
Honey, let me set a spell.
I'm sweating all over this dress.

27:21.265 --> 27:25.884
What, you won't dance with me?
That's a fine thing at your own fais do-do.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.224
Go ask Sookie to dance.
The poor thing's got nobody here.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.817
Everyone's afraid of her.

27:32.360 --> 27:33.975
Go on.

27:39.325 --> 27:44.240
-Y'al| having a good time?
-You look lonely as a cloud. Ain't right.

27:44.413 --> 27:48.873
Why, thank you, Rene.
Arlene is a lucky lady.

27:50.878 --> 27:56.418
-Not everybody likes a coonass like me.
-I do. So does Bill.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.260
I don't have nothing against vampires,
you know that.

28:01.430 --> 28:05.764
But you're a good girl, Sookie.
I think you deserve better.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.263
Mind if I cut in?

28:14.902 --> 28:17.314
Okay, truce?

28:19.615 --> 28:22.277
It's not fair you being mad
about something I can't help.

28:22.451 --> 28:24.988
I'm mad that
you didn't trust me enough to tell me.

28:25.162 --> 28:27.369
You hid the most
important thing about yourself.

28:27.540 --> 28:29.952
So what? You're with Bill now.

28:30.126 --> 28:32.959
Yeah, and you're with Tara.
Another thing you didn't tell me.

28:33.129 --> 28:35.586
-There's nothing to tell.
-Oh, does she know that?

28:35.756 --> 28:40.625
-Or the fact that you can turn into a dog?
-It's none of her business.

28:41.637 --> 28:45.550
And you know what, I didn't tell you
because I knew this is how you'd react.

28:45.725 --> 28:47.807
But you're right. I didn't trust you.

28:47.977 --> 28:50.719
I trusted my instincts,
and they were dead-on.

28:54.317 --> 28:55.898
I think I'll get another beer.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.320
-Do you guys--? You want one?
-Oh, no.

28:58.487 --> 29:01.149
-Babe?
-Oh, no. I'm fine.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.994
You know, I think she's
my favorite girl you ever dated.

29:09.206 --> 29:13.119
-Where'd you meet her at?
-It's kind of embarrassing.

29:13.294 --> 29:14.374
Fangtasia.

29:14.545 --> 29:16.831
-What? The fuck you doing there?
-The vampire bar?

29:17.006 --> 29:20.965
The only reason I went there was because
there was this band playing that I like.

29:21.802 --> 29:25.135
You one brave motherfucker
going there to see them play.

29:25.306 --> 29:27.262
It's just a bunch of losers wearing black.

29:27.433 --> 29:30.675
Amy and I could tell by looking at
each other we didn't belong there.

29:30.853 --> 29:34.016
Then one thing sort of led to another.

29:35.441 --> 29:36.772
Never did see the band.

29:36.943 --> 29:40.982
-Oh, God, I wanna be you.
-So is this it?

29:41.155 --> 29:44.739
She the one who's gonna take Jason
Stackhouse off the market for good?

29:44.909 --> 29:46.774
I don't know.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.656
Now, what you waiting for?

29:49.830 --> 29:53.539
Life is short.
You find a good one, you keep her.

29:55.211 --> 30:00.251
You're right. I never felt this way
about any girl before.

30:00.841 --> 30:03.048
I think that's maybe why....

30:07.181 --> 30:10.799
I think I lost the upper hand
in the relationship, you know?

30:13.062 --> 30:14.427
VVhatsucks?

30:14.605 --> 30:16.106
-You take it back.
-Take it back?

30:16.273 --> 30:17.353
Take it back.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.437
You just say,
"Woman, this is what I want.

30:20.611 --> 30:22.272
This is the way it's gonna be."

30:22.446 --> 30:27.110
And if she don't like it, deep down she'll
respect you. She can't help it. It's her DNA.

30:28.077 --> 30:31.569
-Well, well, now I want to be you.
-Fuck you.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.578
Hey, and if she don't respect you?

30:33.749 --> 30:36.286
She ain't someone that
you wanna be with anyway.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.618
Okay?

30:39.755 --> 30:43.247
-He's right.
-|'ve been keeping an eye on you, Hoyt.

30:43.426 --> 30:47.590
That is your third beer,
and that is two too many.

30:47.763 --> 30:50.220
You set that down. Right now.

30:53.060 --> 30:56.803
You know, I plan on having
about six more beers.

30:56.981 --> 31:02.066
And enough tequila to drown
a Mexican sea captain, woman.

31:06.782 --> 31:08.773
Excuse me.

31:09.869 --> 31:13.111
Longshadow was choking the girl
and would have killed her.

31:13.289 --> 31:17.373
So you murdered a higher life form
for the sake of your pet.

31:17.543 --> 31:21.001
You broke an ancient
and fundamental law.

31:21.172 --> 31:25.165
You decreased our numbers
at a critical time in our history.

31:25.342 --> 31:26.798
Very bad.

31:26.969 --> 31:29.051
Very, very bad.

31:29.221 --> 31:33.555
Magister, Longshadow
broke the law first.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.216
She was mine and he knew it.

31:35.394 --> 31:39.637
-He would have killed her and fed from her.
-Hello, human.

31:39.815 --> 31:40.895
Irrelevant.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.773
Happens every day.

31:42.943 --> 31:44.228
He was stealing from Eric.

31:47.656 --> 31:48.782
Shenﬁ?

31:49.700 --> 31:51.156
Yes, Magister, it's true.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.325
Longshadow was a thief and a liar.

31:53.788 --> 31:55.153
He was hurting my business.

31:57.875 --> 32:02.164
The business part,
that is a serious offense.

32:02.338 --> 32:05.671
And it was the human
who exposed Longshadow.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.093
Would you tell him, Eric?

32:09.428 --> 32:12.044
The only reason the girl was there...

32:12.473 --> 32:13.804
...was because I called her.

32:14.183 --> 32:16.139
To protect your wealth.

32:16.310 --> 32:18.426
To protect my wealth, yes.

32:19.021 --> 32:22.855
Magister, she is...valuable.

32:23.025 --> 32:27.439
Humans exist to serve us.
That is their only value.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.525
There are those among us
who think differently.

32:32.660 --> 32:35.276
Do you question my authority?

32:35.996 --> 32:40.035
I am the Magister.
I was trained in the Inquisition...

32:40.209 --> 32:45.124
...and I am the adjudicator for every
vampire territory in North America.

32:45.297 --> 32:50.041
As the humans say, the humans
you love more than your own kind:

32:50.219 --> 32:52.005
Back your shit down.

32:53.222 --> 32:54.632
Bill.

33:03.065 --> 33:06.102
Well, you haven't bored me.

33:06.443 --> 33:09.059
That works in your favor.

33:10.573 --> 33:13.815
And you seem to be
obedient to your sheriff.

33:13.993 --> 33:16.029
For the most part.

33:19.290 --> 33:23.454
When it matters, yes, he is.

33:24.420 --> 33:29.756
The usual sentence is five years
in a coffin chained with silver.

33:29.925 --> 33:35.966
During which time your body
will waste to leather and sticks.

33:36.974 --> 33:40.091
You'll probably go insane.

33:41.604 --> 33:42.719
However...

33:45.024 --> 33:47.686
...I'm feeling a bit...

33:49.153 --> 33:50.734
...creative.

33:59.955 --> 34:03.072
You know what I love most about Rene?

34:03.250 --> 34:06.083
Aside from his fine little Cajun butt.

34:09.131 --> 34:10.632
He's good to the kids.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.635
He's good to me.

34:14.470 --> 34:17.132
All the rest were fixer-uppers.

34:17.681 --> 34:22.550
But Rene, he's solid
all the way to the foundation.

34:22.728 --> 34:25.014
I can count on him.

34:26.273 --> 34:29.811
And I've never had that in all my life.

34:30.611 --> 34:32.442
I know what you mean.

34:32.613 --> 34:35.980
I mean, I never knew I could have
something like what I have with Jason.

34:36.617 --> 34:39.154
I'm not about to let
anything destroy that.

34:39.703 --> 34:42.445
I don't know how anyone can
trust anybody these days.

34:42.623 --> 34:44.579
They're always keeping things from you.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.162
You don't even know who people are
or what they are.

34:52.675 --> 34:57.260
Well, you know what I love about Jason?
Everything is just right there on the surface.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.511
You never have to wonder
what he's thinking.

34:59.682 --> 35:01.593
Yeah, because he ain't thinking.

35:02.601 --> 35:07.015
-Hey, girlfriends, what's up?
-Tara, you look-- You look great.

35:07.523 --> 35:10.811
Prom night, 2000. I ain't wore it since.

35:10.985 --> 35:12.771
Well, it still fits you.

35:14.321 --> 35:16.232
Tara, come here.

35:17.199 --> 35:19.690
I've never seen you like this.
Is this because of Sam?

35:20.703 --> 35:22.284
I saw you. In his office.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.866
-Why didn't you tell me?
-It's none of your business.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.656
I'm just not sure that dating Sam
is such a good idea.

35:27.835 --> 35:29.700
Well, at least he doesn't drink my blood.

35:34.216 --> 35:37.299
SooMe.SooMe.

35:48.772 --> 35:52.105
-Oh, hey, Andy. You want a beer?
-I don't drink.

35:52.276 --> 35:53.812
Okay.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.397
Had me a very interesting conversation...

35:56.572 --> 35:59.063
...with a man at the naked community
over in Beaumont.

35:59.241 --> 36:01.323
That's right, I already told you.
Last night.

36:01.493 --> 36:04.826
Before you ran off to avoid talking to me.

36:05.456 --> 36:09.369
What's your story, Merlotte?
Who's your people?

36:10.919 --> 36:12.204
I was adopted.

36:12.588 --> 36:14.374
That's the truth.

36:14.882 --> 36:16.873
At 15, I was on my own.

36:17.634 --> 36:20.592
Fifteen, huh? Where'd you go?

36:21.013 --> 36:22.674
Who took you in?

36:22.848 --> 36:26.557
I need to know what your life was before
you bought up property in Bon Temps...

36:26.727 --> 36:29.264
...and women started getting killed.

36:50.751 --> 36:52.332
Mom?

37:11.438 --> 37:14.475
Sam. Sam.

37:17.653 --> 37:19.484
Where the hell did you come from?

37:19.655 --> 37:24.649
I come from exactly the same place
everybody else comes from, Andy.

37:24.827 --> 37:26.488
I been checking up on you.

37:26.662 --> 37:29.324
You got no records before
you moved here. Nothing.

37:29.498 --> 37:36.495
No taxes, no social security,
no credit card bills, no previous address.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.333
-Jesus fuck, Andy.
-Shit.

37:38.674 --> 37:42.667
Don't you ever get tired
of being in everybody's way?

37:42.845 --> 37:45.928
-I'm gonna have to pay for dry-cleaning.
-Hey, baby.

37:47.599 --> 37:51.512
Whoa, hey. Look at you.

37:52.187 --> 37:53.518
Listen.

37:54.106 --> 37:55.846
I have a situation.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.015
A very serious situation.

37:58.193 --> 38:01.105
And I need your help with it. Right now.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.111
I'm here on official police business...

38:03.282 --> 38:05.568
...and we're in the middle
of a conversation.

38:05.742 --> 38:07.949
Well, let me wrap it up for you.

38:08.120 --> 38:10.532
He doesn't know anything.
He didn't do anything.

38:10.706 --> 38:13.368
And he doesn't give a shit.

38:14.710 --> 38:16.541
Come on, Sam.

38:24.553 --> 38:26.043
How much have you had to drink?

38:26.221 --> 38:29.634
Quit acting like my damn boss
and just fuck me, please.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.469
Hey, did you have that exorcism?

38:31.643 --> 38:35.556
-Can't you be a normal guy and go with it?
-Because I'm not a normal guy.

38:35.731 --> 38:38.973
-Well, who the fuck cares?
-Damn it, Tara.

38:40.569 --> 38:44.357
I'm a person. I'm not a prop for you
to use every time you need to feel better.

38:44.656 --> 38:48.240
-Sam, please. I'm not right.
-You're not the only one with demons.

38:49.453 --> 38:52.160
Well, what the fuck
do you want from me?

38:55.209 --> 38:57.791
I don't want a goddamn thing from you.

38:57.961 --> 38:59.917
I don't want nothing from nobody.

39:23.237 --> 39:25.523
I told you to keep
your goddamn mouth shut.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.109
Hey. This is my good shirt.

39:28.283 --> 39:29.784
And yeah, I kept my mouth shut.

39:29.952 --> 39:33.536
My supplier, he gone.
He fucking missing.

39:33.705 --> 39:36.788
If other vampires find out I been selling,
the same shit is gonna--

39:36.959 --> 39:39.325
You understand?
The same shit is gonna happen to me.

39:40.963 --> 39:42.874
You got nothing to worry about.

39:43.048 --> 39:47.417
Bitch, you think life is just this one
fucking game that you always win...

39:47.594 --> 39:50.961
...no matter how many dead folk
are piling up around you.

39:51.807 --> 39:55.470
Maudette. Dawn. Your grandma.

39:55.644 --> 39:59.557
And I tell you one fucking thing:
I ain't gonna be next, bitch.

39:59.731 --> 40:03.724
On my mama grave, motherfucker.
I ain't gonna be next.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.984
FucMnguu

40:16.582 --> 40:18.948
You have no nest.

40:19.126 --> 40:21.993
You prefer to consort with humans.

40:22.921 --> 40:26.630
You seem to have lost
all sense of our priorities.

40:27.175 --> 40:33.341
William Compton, you owe us a life.

40:36.518 --> 40:38.019
No.

40:57.581 --> 40:59.037
No.

41:01.293 --> 41:05.127
Oh, precious Jesus,
God, save me, save me.

41:05.297 --> 41:06.707
Make it all a dream.

41:11.178 --> 41:13.464
Put me in the coffin, Magister.

41:13.639 --> 41:17.348
-I will go willingly.
-Please, it's the first time I ever snuck out.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.887
I only ever get to go to youth choir
and prayer group.

41:24.066 --> 41:27.149
You take me home, I won't say a word
to Mama and Daddy or anybody.

41:27.319 --> 41:30.152
Please, please, just please help me.

41:30.781 --> 41:33.363
There's no help for you, child.

41:41.958 --> 41:44.085
Meet your Maker.

41:52.386 --> 41:54.342
Please don't let them kill me.

41:54.513 --> 41:56.003
Please. I don't want to die.

42:00.686 --> 42:03.177
Honey, you seen Sam? We're out of ice.

42:03.355 --> 42:04.595
I'll get it.

42:04.773 --> 42:07.435
I could use a break from all this anyhow.

42:08.110 --> 42:12.149
Well, thanks for having such a great time
at my party.

42:34.302 --> 42:36.042
Hello.

42:39.307 --> 42:41.639
That's not funny.

44:06.686 --> 44:09.473
Sookie, it's me. Sookie. Hey. Hey.

44:09.648 --> 44:11.730
He's in here. He almost--

44:11.900 --> 44:14.016
What, what?

44:17.906 --> 44:20.147
No,no,no,
please, please don't leave me.

44:20.325 --> 44:24.068
-Don't leave me. Please don't leave me.
-Okay, okay, okay, I won't.

44:24.246 --> 44:26.532
-I won't. I promise.
-Don't leave me.

44:46.226 --> 44:47.841
What the fuck?

44:59.906 --> 45:02.773
If you wanted to feed him,
we should've talked about it first.

45:02.951 --> 45:04.657
I don't need your fucking permission.

45:04.828 --> 45:08.116
Jason, if we don't trust each other,
how is he ever gonna trust us?

45:08.290 --> 45:10.622
This ain't a game,
I don't want him ending up dead.

45:10.792 --> 45:13.454
Oh, God, Jason, come on.
He's gonna kill us.

45:14.629 --> 45:15.664
No, he won't.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.964
I'm gonna let him go,
don't even try to fucking stop me.

45:20.135 --> 45:21.591
-Jason--
-No, please, don't.

45:21.803 --> 45:23.794
Get out of here! Goddamn.

45:23.972 --> 45:25.508
-Please, hurry.
-Yeah, I'm coming.

45:25.682 --> 45:27.138
-Please.
-I'm coming.

45:27.309 --> 45:28.970
People telling me what I can and can't--

45:35.233 --> 45:36.643
Fuck.

45:39.654 --> 45:41.645
If you want to torture anyone,
torture me.

45:41.823 --> 45:43.859
Torture? This?

45:44.034 --> 45:46.650
I don't think so.

45:46.828 --> 45:50.741
I could show you torture, if you like.

45:51.207 --> 45:52.663
No.

45:53.835 --> 45:55.291
No, I was wrong to speak.

45:55.462 --> 45:57.123
You can quit stalling.

45:57.297 --> 46:00.460
What you see in this cow,
Mr. Compton...

46:00.634 --> 46:03.671
...is merely a response to stimuli.

46:03.845 --> 46:05.756
Humans are quite...

46:05.931 --> 46:07.796
...primitive...

46:07.974 --> 46:11.637
...incapable of feeling pain as we do.

46:11.811 --> 46:13.676
But you know that.

46:15.398 --> 46:17.059
Luisa.

46:21.488 --> 46:24.480
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want....

46:24.658 --> 46:27.320
I can't remember what's next.

46:27.494 --> 46:31.988
According to our records, you have
never been a Maker, is that right?

46:32.165 --> 46:33.405
Yes.

46:34.167 --> 46:35.668
But you know the procedure?

46:38.213 --> 46:39.874
Yes.

46:42.926 --> 46:45.042
Then proceed.

47:17.002 --> 47:18.742
Are you a Christian?

47:19.546 --> 47:21.662
I was.

47:22.757 --> 47:24.713
I'm a good girl.

47:25.885 --> 47:27.921
Jesus will take me home to heaven.

47:29.681 --> 47:30.761
What's your name?

47:31.891 --> 47:33.552
Jessica.

47:35.103 --> 47:37.264
Look at me, Jessica.

47:40.775 --> 47:42.766
You're safe now.

47:44.612 --> 47:46.648
Look in my eyes.

47:51.619 --> 47:53.780
Everything will be fine.

47:53.955 --> 47:55.365
I hate to interrupt...

47:55.540 --> 47:58.703
...but glamour is not permitted.

47:58.877 --> 48:01.038
-She's just a girl.
-You are boring me.

48:01.212 --> 48:03.464
Shut up and do as you're told.

48:10.263 --> 48:12.470
-It's all right. It's all right.
-No, let go.

48:12.640 --> 48:14.801
No, no. Let go of me! No!

48:14.976 --> 48:17.388
Stop it! Stop! No!

48:17.562 --> 48:19.098
No!

48:28.114 --> 48:30.230
-Forgive me.
-No.
