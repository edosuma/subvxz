WEBVTT

00:17.450 --> 00:20.386
Friends, ex-girlfriend,
Winston,

00:20.388 --> 00:22.621
months ago I warned you
that winter was coming.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.189
And for the cold and wretched
days ahead,

00:24.191 --> 00:25.958
I stressed our need
to take lovers

00:25.960 --> 00:27.960
and take them quickly.
JESS:
Your head is huge.

00:27.962 --> 00:29.361
(chuckles)
Your hat's

00:29.363 --> 00:30.829
the size of a garbage can.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.032
NICK:
You look great in that hat, man.
What a hunk.

00:33.034 --> 00:34.733
JESS:
You look like Jewish Pharrell.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.402
Th-Thank you very much.
I appreciate it. Okay.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.003
Now, winter is now here.

00:38.005 --> 00:40.406
And I vow that we will not miss

00:40.408 --> 00:44.076
our final opportunity
for sexual realization in 2014.
Did you steal

00:44.078 --> 00:45.544
my belt buckle,
you Silly Billy?

00:45.546 --> 00:46.578
Enough out of you, Winston!

00:46.580 --> 00:48.313
Silly Billy? Dude.

00:48.315 --> 00:50.649
If you unzipped your face and
an old white woman popped out,

00:50.651 --> 00:52.017
I would not be shocked.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.519
Really?
- No.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.054
I would.
- I would be very surprised.

00:55.056 --> 00:56.822
That is why this year
we will not

00:56.824 --> 00:58.490
be celebrating Thanksgiving.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.726
Instead, we will
be celebrating...

01:00.728 --> 01:02.761
Remember last Thanksgiving
when I almost died?

01:02.763 --> 01:05.164
(others agreeing, chattering)

01:05.166 --> 01:07.766
...Bangsgiving! We'll be
celebrating Bangsgiving!

01:07.768 --> 01:10.769
Why can't you let me just have
this, you guys? Please.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.505
Okay. You've been talking about
this for, like, a week, Schmidt.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.374
We get it. Let's just
pick names already.
- Jess,

01:15.376 --> 01:17.743
I can't believe that you are
into Bangsgiving.

01:17.745 --> 01:20.012
I just want to meet a guy
so I can forget about Ryan.

01:20.014 --> 01:21.580
Just date him, Jess.
'Cause I'm his boss,

01:21.582 --> 01:23.248
and it's against the rules
for me to date him.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.783
Just date him. It's a dumb rule.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.585
It's against the rules.
Take the hat.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.221
Oh.
- Now, whosever name
you pick, that's who

01:29.223 --> 01:30.589
you'll be bringing a date for.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.858
And no date leaves
until everyone is laid.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.259
I just want
to meet a nice fella.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.727
Can I have permission
to send them home

01:35.729 --> 01:37.096
without sex?
No, you do not.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.464
I think everybody's date
should be able to leave.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.465
NICK:
Yeah, your plan

01:39.467 --> 01:40.866
sounds a little kidnappy.

01:40.868 --> 01:42.067
What's the rule
on that, Winston?

01:42.069 --> 01:43.535
Eh, gray area. We're good.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.971
Winston is in. My man.
And, okay, nobody say

01:45.973 --> 01:48.373
who you picked.
It'll ruin the surprise.

01:50.977 --> 01:52.878
Oh, crap.
You picked me.

01:52.880 --> 01:55.147
No! How'd you know?
- And now

01:55.149 --> 01:56.748
you're gonna set me up
with you, aren't you?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.083
Cece, I-I know that this holiday

01:58.085 --> 01:59.952
is a bittersweet memory
for your people,

01:59.954 --> 02:01.620
but, please, do not
take that out on me.
Wrong kind of Indian.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.288
Okay, well, I picked you, too,
so I want to re-pick.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.590
No re-picking.
And no more telling.

02:04.592 --> 02:07.559
So, listen up, uh,
for whoever picked me,

02:07.561 --> 02:10.295
I just want you to know
that I have really gotten
into feet lately,

02:10.297 --> 02:13.232
so do with that what you will.
No one do anything
with that.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.968
Can I just say
no mustaches?
I'd like someone tall.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.803
She's got to have an ass.
Can I just reiterate
the whole feet thing?

02:17.805 --> 02:19.771
I want to say
who I picked so bad.

02:19.773 --> 02:21.573
I'm looking for a fake redhead.
With a medium-sized neck.

02:21.575 --> 02:25.244
I just want
to be slapped around.

02:33.086 --> 02:36.088
So, Pearl, I told Winston
that you work at my school.

02:36.090 --> 02:38.323
And, um, Winston is about
to become a cop,

02:38.325 --> 02:40.859
which you've probably
already gathered from the fact

02:40.861 --> 02:43.162
that he pinned his badge
to his sport coat.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.830
What?
(chuckles)

02:44.832 --> 02:46.632
How did that
get there?

02:46.634 --> 02:47.966
Let me freshen your drink.
(chuckles)

02:47.968 --> 02:49.768
Excuse me a second.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.970
(whispering):
Hey, Coach. Coach.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.472
Look at what Jess brought me.

02:53.474 --> 02:54.873
Oh, Pearl?
Yeah, she's great, man.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.375
Hey, come here.
You got something on your face.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.110
Really? What is it? Ow.
It's, like, right...

02:58.112 --> 02:59.111
What were you thinking,
bringing me that girl

02:59.113 --> 03:00.145
from the police academy?

03:00.147 --> 03:01.146
What's wrong with Pepper?

03:01.148 --> 03:02.514
Allow me...

03:02.516 --> 03:04.316
(chuckles)
Arms!

03:04.318 --> 03:06.485
She's jacked, dude.
You should've warned me

03:06.487 --> 03:08.520
you were setting me up with one
of the Guardians of the Galaxy.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.322
I'm sure she's not that bad.

03:10.324 --> 03:12.157
Whoa.

03:12.159 --> 03:13.825
Where was she
when I was cracking walnuts

03:13.827 --> 03:15.127
for the stuffing?
- Look,

03:15.129 --> 03:16.128
she's fantastic.
She's beautiful.

03:16.130 --> 03:17.029
You're gonna love her.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.163
Now, if you jerks

03:18.165 --> 03:19.565
will excuse me, this Bishop's

03:19.567 --> 03:21.300
got to capture himself a queen.

03:21.302 --> 03:22.634
She's doing push-ups.

03:22.636 --> 03:24.803
For your lady.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.038
Thank you.
Thank you very much, Jess.

03:26.040 --> 03:28.407
Pearl, she's...
Yeah, she's great.

03:28.409 --> 03:31.109
What grade does she teach?
Oh, she doesn't teach.
She's the lunch lady.

03:33.413 --> 03:36.415
(chuckles)
You said the lunch lady?
Yeah.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.851
So where exactly
is this "date" of mine?

03:39.853 --> 03:42.521
All right, I invited Lucy,
like you asked.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.989
Your date's name is Geoff

03:43.991 --> 03:45.557
and he will be here.
By the way,

03:45.559 --> 03:48.093
he spells Geoff with a "G,"
so you know he comes from money.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.561
NICK: Well, I think
the real difference is

03:49.563 --> 03:51.029
crocodiles
are man-eaters

03:51.031 --> 03:54.233
and alligators...
What in the bloody hell?

03:54.235 --> 03:58.170
Uh, hey, Nick.
What is Tran doing here?

03:58.172 --> 04:00.439
Oh, well,
I picked my own name.

04:00.441 --> 04:02.608
So you said to bring somebody.
So I thought it'd be weird

04:02.610 --> 04:04.176
if I didn't bring someone.
So I just brought Tran.

04:04.178 --> 04:05.744
You brought an old Asian man
to my sex party

04:05.746 --> 04:07.179
so it wouldn't be weird?

04:07.181 --> 04:09.514
Relax.
He didn't come empty-handed.

04:09.516 --> 04:13.085
He brought a game.
It's like Thailand Monopoly.

04:13.087 --> 04:16.188
Yeah, all the squares are jail
except for one piece of property

04:16.190 --> 04:18.090
which we all have
to fight each other for.

04:18.092 --> 04:20.225
But don't get caught
in the Red Light District.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.561
This isn't
a freaking game night, Nick.
Okay, chill out.

04:22.563 --> 04:25.230
(knocking)
You... You're making a mockery
of this holiday and you know it.

04:25.232 --> 04:26.632
I didn't mean
to make fun of Thailand,

04:26.634 --> 04:28.300
if that's
where you're from even.

04:29.369 --> 04:31.203
Hey.
- Lucy.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.205
It's so good to see you.
How are you?

04:33.207 --> 04:36.475
Oh, I'm great.
- Lucy? Lucy's here
with Schmidt?

04:36.477 --> 04:38.810
Where's my set-up, already?
I'm looking at the menu,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.746
and I see a lot of skirt
but no steak.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.614
I think that Coach picked you,
so watch out.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.783
'Cause I'm sure he's gonna bring
one of his clients

04:44.785 --> 04:46.752
or weird, like, gym buddies.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.620
(whispering):
Ryan.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.389
What?
Ryan. Ryan.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.891
Ryan-Ryan?
He brought Ryan. Oh, God.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.226
I don't think I can
even look at him,

04:54.228 --> 04:55.894
like, without
getting pregnant.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.963
He just oozes sex.

04:57.965 --> 05:00.599
Good holiday to you!
I've come with biscuits!

05:00.601 --> 05:02.501
(groaning)

05:04.737 --> 05:07.739
Hey, hey, hey, Schmidt,
Lucy? I-I used to date Lucy.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.309
Oh, I know, bro.
I met her that day you gave
me the pass to your gym.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.211
Hey, do you have any snacks?!

05:14.981 --> 05:16.782
Yeah, you blew her off. I didn't
think it would be a problem.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.183
Oh, it's a problem.
I'm telling you it's a problem.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.284
And I forbid you
from dating her,

05:19.286 --> 05:21.086
so...
(whistles) cut it off.

05:21.088 --> 05:24.756
Grounds?
The statute of limitation
hasn't expired.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.158
You dated her three years ago

05:26.160 --> 05:27.659
for, like,
two and a half months.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.995
The statute is very specific.
1,000 showers.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.763
After that, no claim.
And if you think

05:31.765 --> 05:34.533
I've showered 1,000 times
in the past three years,

05:34.535 --> 05:36.268
then you're out of your mind.

05:36.270 --> 05:38.670
Did you ever spend more than $65
on her, not including tip?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.772
It's tough. There were a
lot of coupons involved.
Did you ever watch her dog?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.607
Trick question: she had fish
and I killed them.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.475
You ever get her a gift?

05:43.477 --> 05:45.143
Every time we had sex.

05:45.145 --> 05:47.779
(laughs)
No claim.
- (laughs) No claim?

05:47.781 --> 05:49.348
Hi, Nick.
It's been a long time.

05:49.350 --> 05:51.983
Lucille.
Great to see you.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.287
Do you still like to
eat, uh... popcorn?

05:55.289 --> 05:58.223
I guess so.
Oh, you see that?
I know her foods.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.492
You must
have spoiled her, huh?

06:00.494 --> 06:02.861
You know, if you'll excuse us,
I'm gonna give Lucy the tour.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.196
Come on, Lucy.

06:05.498 --> 06:08.700
I'm calling
my penis "the tour."

06:08.702 --> 06:11.136
My tour's more satisfying.

06:11.138 --> 06:14.506
His is all about him.
Mine's about you sometimes.

06:14.508 --> 06:15.841
Hi.

06:15.843 --> 06:17.743
Hi. Uh, thanks
for inviting me tonight.

06:17.745 --> 06:20.178
I-I didn't realize
this was a singles party.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.013
Oh. No. Uh, s-sorry.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.416
Did Coach say that
with a Sean Connery accent?

06:24.418 --> 06:26.585
Did he say "shingles"?
'Cause he was...

06:26.587 --> 06:29.755
He actually meant shingles.
Like the... like...

06:29.757 --> 06:32.491
Everybody here
is a-a roofer.

06:37.096 --> 06:40.866
Look, the last time
I saw you, I kissed you.

06:40.868 --> 06:43.435
I know that. We both know that.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.070
Mm.
But this can't happen.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.671
Are we attracted
to each other?

06:46.673 --> 06:48.507
Yes. Do I sing Oasis songs
to myself and pretend

06:48.509 --> 06:51.443
that they were inspired
by your love for me? I do.

06:51.445 --> 06:53.578
But my job is to
enforce the rules.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.914
And I love my job. And
I worked hard to get it.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.416
So this cannot happen.

06:57.418 --> 06:58.850
Is that why you've locked me
in your bedroom

06:58.852 --> 07:00.519
and undone the top button
on your dress?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.587
I didn't undo the t...

07:04.457 --> 07:06.792
Well, I did.

07:06.794 --> 07:10.462
But that was an accident.
That wasn't for you.

07:11.364 --> 07:13.432
It was for me.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.636
I just need to know that you
will respect the rules

07:17.638 --> 07:19.971
and that this
will go no further.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.506
I'll do my best.

07:22.408 --> 07:24.543
Looks like you missed a few.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.678
What?

07:30.082 --> 07:31.216
Okay, I summoned
everyone to the roof

07:31.218 --> 07:32.417
because Bangsgiving is in peril.

07:32.419 --> 07:33.785
All of you are focusing
on things

07:33.787 --> 07:35.253
that have nothing
to do with getting laid.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.422
Let us please not repeat
the mistakes that we made

07:37.424 --> 07:39.157
at my Eight Nights
of Hump-akah party.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.660
Now, what is
the freakin' problem?

07:41.662 --> 07:43.595
Coach did the opposite
of what I asked.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.397
Come on, Jess, you guys
would be great together.

07:45.399 --> 07:47.499
It's a dumb rule,
all right?
- Dumb rule.

07:47.501 --> 07:48.934
At least he turns you on.
Pepper makes my ding-dong

07:48.936 --> 07:50.669
and my ping-pongs
go into my body.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.404
Can somebody help
me with this keg?

07:52.406 --> 07:54.639
Yeah, sure.
Pepper's got it.

07:54.641 --> 07:58.343
(grunts)

07:58.345 --> 08:00.479
What if she doesn't know
her own strength down there, and

08:00.481 --> 08:02.614
Be a nightmare.
- she mushes it, or,
like, rips it off

08:02.616 --> 08:04.182
and throws it across the room
like a hot dog?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.351
That's nothing. Jess brought me
a hot lunch lady.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.353
What am I supposed
to do with that?

08:08.355 --> 08:10.455
Do sex with
the lunch lady.

08:10.457 --> 08:11.857
Wait.
- That's obvious.
I have a real...

08:11.859 --> 08:13.692
I know how it sounds.
I know how it sounds,

08:13.694 --> 08:15.994
but she's a... like,
a real lunch lady.
- That's hot.
- No.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.662
A woman that's willing,
ready and able...
NICK: That's not an issue.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.598
After she has sex with you,
she can put food in your mouth.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.199
That's not a problem at all.
I do have a real problem.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.768
Schmidt is trying to sleep with
a woman I've already slept with.

08:23.770 --> 08:27.272
Well, at least he has a date,
because mine never showed up.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.174
Geoff is coming! Apparently,
a wild peacock got loose

08:29.176 --> 08:30.842
on the freeway,
and is holding up traffic.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.478
Now, you guys,
we have guests downstairs.

08:33.480 --> 08:37.182
And if we don't get back to them
soon, they're gonna get spooked.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.787
Um, so, have you always
been from England?

08:44.624 --> 08:46.024
I'm not going downstairs

08:46.026 --> 08:47.459
until Schmidt agrees
to not sleep with Lucy.

08:47.461 --> 08:48.960
Okay, yeah, sure. Never!

08:48.962 --> 08:50.662
According to the statute,

08:50.664 --> 08:53.064
if you two can't agree,
we take it to a vote.

08:53.066 --> 08:55.133
The winner gets the
girl, the loser

08:55.135 --> 08:56.801
gets five grilled
cheese sandwiches.

08:56.803 --> 08:57.969
NICK:
I'll agree to that.
Let's do it.

08:57.971 --> 08:59.804
All right, all those in favor

08:59.806 --> 09:02.707
of Schmidt<i> not</i> sleeping with
Lucy, raise your hand now.

09:02.709 --> 09:03.642
I don't care.
Couldn't care less.

09:03.644 --> 09:04.576
Raise 'em up.

09:04.578 --> 09:06.878
Put 'em up.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.713
Huzzah! Warning: tonight
things will get loud with Lucy.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.082
But don't worry. I'll have her
jam a sock in my mouth

09:11.084 --> 09:12.584
right before I see angels.

09:12.586 --> 09:15.320
Okay, guys, what
about me?
- Get your own sock.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.322
No. What am I gonna do
about Ryan?

09:17.324 --> 09:18.990
Just have sex with him.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.859
Look, bang one out,
get it out of your system.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.661
I don't do that.
You should do that.

09:22.663 --> 09:24.162
You should bang one out.
Yeah, makes
the most sense.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.864
What?!
- Nothing else has worked,
okay, and the best way

09:25.866 --> 09:28.500
to get over a crush is just
to do something about it.

09:28.502 --> 09:32.003
I don't know.
Plus, he's British, so you know
the sex will be weirdly polite.

09:32.005 --> 09:34.573
(with British accent):
Do you mind if I finish now?

09:34.575 --> 09:36.341
He doesn't sound
like Oliver Twist.

09:36.343 --> 09:38.276
(British accent):
Do you like that?
Is that good, eh?

09:38.278 --> 09:41.179
All right. Here we go.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.582
One-- really? Two-- what?

09:43.584 --> 09:45.350
(indistinct British mumbling)

09:45.352 --> 09:47.619
Hey, you like it
when I do it like that, eh?

09:47.621 --> 09:48.787
That was spot-on.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.221
All those in favor

09:50.223 --> 09:52.190
of Jess doing Ryan,
raise your hand.

09:58.197 --> 10:00.031
(talking quietly)

10:00.033 --> 10:01.733
Oh, he's trying
to mess with me?

10:01.735 --> 10:04.102
Here I go.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.873
Cecilia.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.542
No, you cannot
have my beer.

10:10.544 --> 10:11.943
(laughs)

10:11.945 --> 10:13.311
NICK: You think I'm going
after the beer.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.746
You okay?
- Mm.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.815
Okay, great.

10:18.150 --> 10:19.384
(groans)

10:19.386 --> 10:21.052
(talks quietly)

10:21.054 --> 10:22.687
(phone buzzing)

10:27.393 --> 10:28.893
(gasps)

10:28.895 --> 10:30.829
Happy Bangsgiving.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.697
(whispers):
Close the door.

10:33.899 --> 10:36.501
Oh, my God.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.970
Is there nothing
underneath that apron?

10:38.972 --> 10:42.607
Just a little white meat
looking for some gravy.

10:42.609 --> 10:45.810
That probably wasn't very sexy.
I shouldn't have said that!

10:45.812 --> 10:47.912
No, it was very becoming.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.849
I'm totally confused
about these oven mitts.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.852
How else am I supposed to take
a hot dish out of the oven?

10:53.854 --> 10:55.987
These mitts were a bad idea.

10:55.989 --> 11:01.026
What, uh, got you in the-the,
uh, holiday, uh, sp-spirit?

11:01.028 --> 11:03.695
Well, I like you, you like me.

11:03.697 --> 11:07.265
Why don't we just...
bang one out of our system?

11:07.267 --> 11:09.601
Bang one out
of our system?

11:09.603 --> 11:12.604
It sounds really bad.
I get that.

11:12.606 --> 11:14.139
And I hear it now,
it sounds awful.

11:14.141 --> 11:17.776
But we just bang one
out of our system, and then,

11:17.778 --> 11:20.445
we can go back to our strictly
professional relationship,

11:20.447 --> 11:23.114
and I can stop thinking about
you all the time, which I do.

11:23.116 --> 11:24.949
I didn't come here
to bang one out.

11:24.951 --> 11:26.551
Well, you know what I mean.

11:26.553 --> 11:27.819
Look...
- I care about you.

11:27.821 --> 11:29.354
Well...
- Jess, I'm crazy about you.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.723
Ryan, look. Oh, God,
it's so complicated.

11:31.725 --> 11:33.825
Can I just put some pants on
when we talk about this?

11:33.827 --> 11:35.326
It is complicated.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.896
This would have been worth it.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.731
Oh, God. Ryan. Ryan!

11:39.733 --> 11:41.166
Oh, God!

11:41.168 --> 11:42.567
NICK:
Oh! Yeah!

11:42.569 --> 11:44.703
(hooting, whooping
and overlapping chatter)

11:44.705 --> 11:47.405
SCHMIDT:
Oh, no!

11:47.407 --> 11:50.041
Freaking Bangsgiving.

11:53.579 --> 11:56.114
SCHMIDT:
No, I actually put those
in there myself.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.317
I'll tell you, I wouldn't
eat asparagus though.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.518
It makes your pee smell.

12:00.520 --> 12:01.453
(laughs)
- Mmm.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.725
Hey, Cece, I got
that $20 I owe you.

12:06.727 --> 12:09.094
It's, uh... it's
in my bedroom.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.529
Okay.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.598
Yeah, it's right this way.

12:17.870 --> 12:21.239
You're really
sexy for a Jew.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.675
Not now, woman!

12:23.677 --> 12:25.677
Wait. What?

12:25.679 --> 12:28.012
Who needs men?
You don't need a man.

12:28.014 --> 12:30.248
You can lift your
own furniture.
- Hey, Pepper.

12:30.250 --> 12:33.118
Oh, God.
- Oh, my God,
are you okay?

12:33.120 --> 12:36.688
I am so sorry.
You approached my blind spot.
(Coach groans)

12:36.690 --> 12:39.057
Your money's in here somewhere.
Let me just find it, okay?
Oh, great.

12:39.059 --> 12:40.959
<i>Oh!</i>

12:40.961 --> 12:42.427
What's wrong? You hurt yourself?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.295
No. It's just not there.
Uh, let me.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.797
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!

12:45.799 --> 12:47.398
Ooh. Ooh,
that feels so good!

12:47.400 --> 12:49.734
When I'm looking for your money,
it feels so good.

12:49.736 --> 12:52.437
(laughing):
Oh! I love that!

12:52.439 --> 12:54.205
You're a nasty woman!

12:54.207 --> 12:55.940
'Cause you're making me
give the money to you.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.375
Nick...

12:57.377 --> 12:59.544
Oh, Cece, you love this!
Getting your money.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.046
What exactly are you
doing right now?
- (whispers):
I'm getting your money.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.448
You're definitely
not getting my money.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.949
In no world
do you have my money.

13:04.951 --> 13:06.584
I was flirting with you

13:06.586 --> 13:08.653
to give Schmidt a taste
of his own medicine.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.288
Okay? And it's a huge mistake,

13:10.290 --> 13:11.923
and insulting to everyone
involved, and I'm sorry.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.424
Yeah, and also, he would never

13:13.426 --> 13:15.226
fall for that at all, okay?

13:15.228 --> 13:16.995
You're a dead man,
Miller!

13:16.997 --> 13:18.296
Don't. Don't.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.430
SCHMIDT:
I'll choke you to death.

13:19.432 --> 13:20.732
I'll choke<i> you</i> to death.

13:20.734 --> 13:22.267
CECE:
Barely fighting.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.568
Schmidt, nothing was going on!

13:23.570 --> 13:24.803
He was just trying
to make you jealous.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.437
Please. I know that!

13:26.439 --> 13:28.740
He would never hit on you.
You're on my Never List.

13:28.742 --> 13:32.177
I know she's on your Never...
Whoa! Whoa! What are you doing?

13:32.179 --> 13:34.512
You're pissed at me for bringing
Lucy, and you bring Tran

13:34.514 --> 13:36.648
as a date?
Hey, leave Tran out of this.
He fought in Korea!

13:36.650 --> 13:38.817
I don't know which side,
but I know he's a war hero.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.251
You couldn't find one of
those drunk girls at the bar?

13:40.253 --> 13:41.452
The ones with no
family or friends?

13:41.454 --> 13:43.021
That's your sweet spot, man.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.490
I know I could have.
I didn't want to.
- Why not?

13:46.692 --> 13:48.293
What kind of woman
have you been sleeping with

13:48.295 --> 13:49.727
since you and Jess broke up?

13:50.696 --> 13:52.931
Terrible ones.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.699
And how does that make you feel?

13:54.701 --> 13:56.601
Terrible.

13:56.603 --> 13:58.303
Then really good.

13:58.305 --> 14:00.271
Expected. Expected.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.106
There you go.
- But then,
immediately after, terrible.

14:02.108 --> 14:03.942
I'm just gonna put this
out there, but I think

14:03.944 --> 14:05.443
you'd probably rather like
to sleep with someone

14:05.445 --> 14:07.145
who doesn't make you feel
terrible,

14:07.147 --> 14:10.248
but you're just a little
afraid of getting hurt again.

14:11.383 --> 14:13.585
No, that doesn't sound right.

14:15.287 --> 14:17.222
You know, growing up,

14:17.224 --> 14:19.357
we had this lunch lady
named Ms. Witten.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.393
One day, I cut in line so
I can get extra Tater Tots,

14:22.395 --> 14:25.163
and as punishment, she
made me eat the entire tray

14:25.165 --> 14:27.065
in front of her...

14:27.067 --> 14:30.068
while she stared at me
for a long period of time.

14:30.070 --> 14:33.137
I'm not sure if you know how
hard that is for a growing boy.

14:33.139 --> 14:35.406
How old were you?
- I was 18.

14:35.408 --> 14:37.575
(laughs)

14:37.577 --> 14:40.745
If it helps, we're called
lunch monitors now.

14:40.747 --> 14:42.847
No one says
"lunch lady" anymore.

14:42.849 --> 14:47.852
Oh. Kind of like how we can't
call little people "shrinkies."

14:47.854 --> 14:50.622
Oh. Lunch Monitor
Pearl. I like it.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.730
Excellent form.

14:58.732 --> 15:01.099
You don't have a hard job.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.602
So, I saw your
butt earlier.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.371
It's been holding up nicely.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.840
It does the trick.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.844
And I noticed,
uh, Ryan left.

15:12.846 --> 15:16.581
Yeah. Ugh!
It's so embarrassing.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.283
I kind of came onto him,

15:18.285 --> 15:22.453
and he told me
he wanted more than just sex.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.556
He wanted more than sex
and that's a bad thing? How?

15:25.558 --> 15:27.258
Well, look, I'm his boss.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.694
We could get sued,
and I could get fired.

15:29.696 --> 15:31.729
There's a reason
it's against the rules.

15:31.731 --> 15:33.264
You gotta br... okay.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.966
Remember when we tried to watch
<i>Ferris Bueller's Day Off?</i>

15:34.968 --> 15:37.869
Okay, I stick by that--
that kid is not a hero.

15:37.871 --> 15:40.138
All he does is break rules.
What's so great about that?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.874
You're taking Rooney's side.
No one takes Rooney's side.

15:42.876 --> 15:44.475
I'm a vice principal--
Rooney is my people.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.078
Ferris hijacks a parade.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.579
That is an act of terror.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.315
You want to know what I think,
'cause you're not going

15:50.317 --> 15:51.816
to like it.
- What?

15:51.818 --> 15:53.785
I don't think this is
about breaking rules.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.286
I think Ryan scares you.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.822
You like him, and you're
going to have to put yourself

15:57.824 --> 16:00.258
out there again,
and that scares you.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.827
But look,

16:02.829 --> 16:05.897
life moves really fast.

16:05.899 --> 16:10.935
And if you don't stop and
look around once in a while,

16:10.937 --> 16:13.571
you just might miss it.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.840
Is that from<i> Ferris Bueller?</i>

16:15.842 --> 16:17.108
Yes, it is.
- Okay.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.576
It's a terrific movie.
- All right.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.311
And I delivered it perfectly.

16:20.313 --> 16:22.146
It was pretty good.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.452
What are you doing here?

16:27.454 --> 16:29.220
You're fired.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.190
(laughs)
Just kidding.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.158
Oh, God.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.097
You left without eating
so I thought, um...

16:39.099 --> 16:41.265
I'd bring you a pie.
Well, most of a pie.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.301
The guys ate some of it.
That's a lie.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.004
I ate-I ate-I ate a piece
on the way over.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.305
I-I ate two pieces.

16:47.307 --> 16:48.606
Three pieces.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.141
Thank you.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.509
You're welcome.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.711
Would you like to come inside?

16:53.713 --> 16:54.879
No, um, I came here
to say something

16:54.881 --> 16:57.281
and that is...

16:57.283 --> 16:59.350
I want more, too.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.188
This dish is empty.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.958
Okay. I ate the whole pie.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.826
Look, I don't know
what I'm doing

17:08.828 --> 17:10.161
or where this is going

17:10.163 --> 17:13.231
(sighs)
and I'm scared, but...

17:13.233 --> 17:16.401
it's worth it
'cause it feels big.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.404
And that's why I'm going
to leave right now,

17:19.406 --> 17:21.406
and we're going to take it slow.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.681
Wow.

17:30.683 --> 17:33.885
Well, tonight is Bangsgiving,

17:33.887 --> 17:35.887
and I have to honor my
American traditions.

17:35.889 --> 17:38.723
And it's my duty
as an American...

17:41.193 --> 17:44.529
I think I'm going to stop
being afraid and start dating.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.598
You probably knew
all along, didn't you?

17:47.600 --> 17:50.768
If only I could
meet a girl like you, Tran.

17:50.770 --> 17:53.004
Your face, your brain--
throw it in a dress.

17:53.006 --> 17:55.740
Oh, daddy,
I'd be with her forever.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.208
I'm getting off topic.

17:57.210 --> 18:00.011
Thanks for the talk.
I feel a lot better.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.780
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.883
Tran, are these all yours?

18:05.885 --> 18:07.418
Come on, man.

18:07.420 --> 18:09.087
I thought you were
switching to white wine.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.089
How do you think you're going
to get home now?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.758
You're not driving, so how are
you going to get home?

18:13.760 --> 18:15.927
(knocking)

18:15.929 --> 18:17.695
Hey.

18:17.697 --> 18:20.031
Are you Nick?

18:20.033 --> 18:24.035
You the guy who's obsessed
with my grandfather?

18:25.270 --> 18:27.705
Grandpaps,
you ready to go?

18:33.378 --> 18:35.780
Hey.
- (screams)

18:35.782 --> 18:38.983
Ah, ah, ha... hey.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.885
I'm taking off. Um...

18:40.887 --> 18:42.553
sorry I body-slammed you

18:42.555 --> 18:44.755
but this doesn't feel like
it's working out

18:44.757 --> 18:46.257
so I don't really want
to waste our time.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.893
Look, Pepper, um...

18:48.895 --> 18:50.161
I think you're beautiful,

18:50.163 --> 18:52.263
and very nice.

18:52.265 --> 18:53.898
I just, uh...

18:53.900 --> 18:56.400
You know, I'm not used to...

18:56.402 --> 18:58.970
dating women that
are stronger than me.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.172
How do you know
that I'm stronger than you?

19:01.174 --> 19:02.940
Do you want to arm wrestle?

19:02.942 --> 19:04.509
Yeah, like I'm that insecure
that I have to prove

19:04.511 --> 19:06.944
my masculinity by
arm wrestling a girl.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.313
(yells)
Come on.

19:09.315 --> 19:10.848
Ready?
- Yeah.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.350
One, two, three.

19:12.352 --> 19:15.753
(grunting)

19:15.755 --> 19:17.955
(yells)

19:17.957 --> 19:20.024
Yes! That's how you do it!

19:20.026 --> 19:23.094
That's how it's
uh-uh-uh done!

19:23.096 --> 19:25.363
(moaning)
- (giggling)

19:26.698 --> 19:28.099
Thank you for
letting me win.

19:28.101 --> 19:29.834
Sure. Anytime.

19:35.974 --> 19:37.308
Well, Lucy left.

19:37.310 --> 19:39.477
Turns out she's a bit
of an anti-Semite.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.946
Hmm.
- Yeah, looks like
we both struck out.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.514
Okay, Schmidt,
there is no Geoff.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.517
Come on. But to honest, I'm
kind of glad there isn't.

19:46.519 --> 19:47.818
You know,
Thanksgiving should be spent

19:47.820 --> 19:49.887
with the people
that you care about.

19:51.223 --> 19:52.857
Let me get you a beer.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.225
By the way...

19:54.227 --> 19:56.194
you're on my Never List, too.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.570
Hi.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.138
Are you Cece?

20:07.140 --> 20:08.906
I'm Geoff.

20:08.908 --> 20:10.174
Um, I'm Schmidt's friend.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.375
I'm sorry I'm late.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.477
I hit a peacock on my way here

20:13.479 --> 20:16.514
and then I held it in my arms
until it died.

20:16.516 --> 20:19.684
It was horrible,
but also kind of uplifting.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.286
Um, anyway,
I brought creamed spinach.

20:24.856 --> 20:27.758
(speaking Hindi)

20:31.363 --> 20:34.732
¶ It takes time ¶

20:36.501 --> 20:39.237
¶ You worry too much ¶
(panting)

20:39.239 --> 20:41.939
(panting continues)

20:41.941 --> 20:45.343
¶ All those sunny days ¶

20:45.345 --> 20:48.012
(grunts)
- Yeah! (laughs)

20:48.014 --> 20:52.683
¶ You worry too much ¶

20:52.685 --> 20:54.018
There's my number.
- Gr...

20:54.020 --> 20:56.053
Tran! Hey, would you
hit that. Maybe...

20:56.055 --> 20:57.688
Yeah.

20:57.690 --> 21:02.260
¶ 'Cause nothing is real ¶

21:03.462 --> 21:07.098
¶ When you're all alone ¶

21:09.034 --> 21:13.437
¶ 'Cause nothing is real ¶

21:13.439 --> 21:16.374
¶ My mother told me so ¶

21:16.376 --> 21:18.776
¶ Don't let the sun kiss
your lips ¶

21:18.778 --> 21:21.979
¶ She knows all of the tricks ¶

21:21.981 --> 21:24.282
¶ Let the sun
kiss your lips... ¶

21:24.284 --> 21:25.816
Ed Rooney.

21:25.818 --> 21:27.818
CAMERON (over phone):
Hi. This is George Peterson.

21:27.820 --> 21:29.620
How are you today, sir?

21:29.622 --> 21:32.123
JESS (groans in frustration):
It's not him, Rooney.

21:32.125 --> 21:37.995
This movie should be called
<i>The Day Rooney Tried to Do</i>
<i>His Job.</i>
