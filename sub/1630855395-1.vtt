1
00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:28.208
How may I help you?

2
00:00:28.291 --> 00:00:30.166
We're seeking a girl and a witcher.

3
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.791
Her with ashen hair
and patrician countenance.

4
00:00:32.875 --> 00:00:34.875
Him a mannerless, blanched brute.

5
00:00:35.541 --> 00:00:37.500
Master Rience
will recompense you handsomely

6
00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:39.666
for illumination as to their whereabouts.

7
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.250
Hmm?

8
00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:44.625
We'll pay if you've seen them.

9
00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:11.113
Step back, Professor.

10
00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:43.916
Ah...

11
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.375
I importune you, benignant sir...

12
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.250
Hmm.

13
00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:21.416
Dear friend, if our time
at Kaer Morhen proved anything,

14
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.125
it's that the world is changing
underneath our feet.

15
00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:29.125
Days pass, but the threats keep coming,
fast and furiously.

16
00:02:30.791 --> 00:02:33.708
Sometimes I wonder
if we will ever stop running.

17
00:02:37.416 --> 00:02:39.458
- For your discretion.
- Thank you.

18
00:02:55.041 --> 00:02:57.458
There is another ghost
that haunts us.

19
00:02:58.333 --> 00:02:59.500
What I did to you.

20
00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:03.208
I know I cannot change the past,

21
00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:07.291
but I will do everything in my power
to help Ciri grow her magical skill.

22
00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:09.416
And to help keep her safe.

23
00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:19.250
By proving that to you,
maybe trust will find its way back to us.

24
00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:22.958
In the meantime, wish Ciri luck.

25
00:03:23.916 --> 00:03:26.333
It's going to be a long road ahead
for all of us.

26
00:03:27.416 --> 00:03:29.416
Your friend, Yennefer.

27
00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:35.576
This was the first lesson
Tissaia taught me.

28
00:03:43.666 --> 00:03:44.666
Give it a try.

29
00:03:46.208 --> 00:03:49.208
Dear friend,
even in your silence,

30
00:03:49.291 --> 00:03:52.583
I know you're wondering
how Ciri's training is progressing.

31
00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:55.750
She has great potential but little talent.

32
00:04:01.583 --> 00:04:03.625
That will change over time.

33
00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:06.958
Someday, she'll be able
to conjure something tastier

34
00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:09.166
than the squid
you're likely bringing right now.

35
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.166
- Hmm.
- Your friend, Yennefer.

36
00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:14.958
You need to focus on your breath.

37
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:18.083
From here. Okay?

38
00:04:26.708 --> 00:04:27.708
Not again.

39
00:04:32.666 --> 00:04:34.375
Ciri, Yennefer, we're leaving!

40
00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:38.041
Quickly!

41
00:04:38.125 --> 00:04:39.125
Stop!

42
00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:42.666
- Quick, do that.
- That side!

43
00:04:45.125 --> 00:04:47.958
Missed them again!
Where the fuck are they?

44
00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:50.041
Burn it all down!

45
00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:24.625
For your discretion.

46
00:05:51.375 --> 00:05:53.375
That was brilliant!

47
00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:57.166
Dear friend, it seems that

48
00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.833
you and Ciri are thoroughly enjoying
our fourth house in as many months,

49
00:06:00.916 --> 00:06:03.208
finding time to bond so delightfully.

50
00:06:05.083 --> 00:06:09.666
I will remind you, though, that you asked,
nay, begged me to teach her magic.

51
00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:13.875
Please conserve her energy
so that I may properly do so.

52
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.625
Also, less meat, more wine.

53
00:06:18.208 --> 00:06:19.291
- Yennefer.
- Hmm.

54
00:06:21.041 --> 00:06:23.125
Success only comes
with repetition.

55
00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:52.416
You can do it. Don't give up.

56
00:07:16.791 --> 00:07:18.351
Stay together! Hurry up!

57
00:07:18.416 --> 00:07:20.125
They're just villagers, Geralt.

58
00:07:20.208 --> 00:07:21.208
Let's go.

59
00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:09.708
Yarpen!

60
00:08:09.750 --> 00:08:12.125
You really wanna hide,
you'd dye that mop.

61
00:08:12.208 --> 00:08:13.958
No one's lookin'
for the Black fuckin' Wolf.

62
00:08:14.041 --> 00:08:16.583
- Hello, old friend.
- Don't break my shite!

63
00:08:16.666 --> 00:08:20.166
And I expect payment for my discretion!

64
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.125
Dear friend,

65
00:08:46.208 --> 00:08:49.166
we're so far off the map here
that we may never leave again.

66
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.875
Ooh!

67
00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.541
Come to think of it,

68
00:08:53.208 --> 00:08:54.916
would that be such a bad thing?

69
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:58.833
We'll continue magic lessons
before the ice melts, I promise.

70
00:08:58.916 --> 00:09:01.458
But for now,
perhaps the girl deserves a break.

71
00:09:01.541 --> 00:09:03.916
Perhaps you and I do too.

72
00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:09.958
- Your friend, Yennefer.
- Let's go again.

73
00:09:10.041 --> 00:09:11.750
- Again. Ready?
- Okay.

74
00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:13.166
One foot...

75
00:09:24.583 --> 00:09:27.333
I can magically intuit
your thoughts, Geralt.

76
00:09:27.416 --> 00:09:30.625
You've been wanting to invite me
to dinner ever since we arrived.

77
00:09:31.375 --> 00:09:32.208
Have I?

78
00:09:32.291 --> 00:09:36.541
No. But I looked through
your window and you have more wine.

79
00:09:36.625 --> 00:09:38.500
And I'm begging for a refill.

80
00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:54.958
Hmm.

81
00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:03.583
Thank you.

82
00:10:08.375 --> 00:10:09.791
Just a bit of this.

83
00:10:10.833 --> 00:10:12.666
- Perfect.
- Mmm!

84
00:10:15.541 --> 00:10:17.875
- That one was a masterpiece.
- Right.

85
00:10:22.375 --> 00:10:24.625
- Made by chef Ciri.
- Open your mouth!

86
00:10:29.375 --> 00:10:31.416
Geralt's favorite food is radish.

87
00:10:33.666 --> 00:10:34.541
Ooh!

88
00:10:34.625 --> 00:10:37.333
We always made that, so at least once...

89
00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.500
Wait...

90
00:10:40.916 --> 00:10:41.916
Thank you.

91
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.208
- I'm going to go to bed now.
- Okay.

92
00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.166
- Good night.
- Good night.

93
00:11:00.916 --> 00:11:02.166
Uh. Well...

94
00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:10.833
Good night.

95
00:11:18.625 --> 00:11:19.625
Good night.

96
00:11:48.083 --> 00:11:49.375
Water magic is tricky.

97
00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:52.125
That's what you said
about earth magic, and air magic.

98
00:11:52.208 --> 00:11:54.375
Well, you have power
like nothing I've seen.

99
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:56.750
Makes it hard for both of us.

100
00:11:58.458 --> 00:12:00.041
That's enough for today.

101
00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:06.541
Considering the mess I make
with every other kind of magic,

102
00:12:07.041 --> 00:12:09.166
how could fire magic be any worse?

103
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:13.083
Remember Rience.

104
00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:17.500
That look in his eye.
There's always a source.

105
00:12:18.291 --> 00:12:20.125
With fire magic, the source is you.

106
00:12:20.791 --> 00:12:22.791
It takes something you never get back.

107
00:12:23.791 --> 00:12:24.833
Your magic?

108
00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:27.083
Yes.

109
00:12:28.083 --> 00:12:29.541
But magic isn't everything.

110
00:12:32.416 --> 00:12:34.041
You say magic isn't everything,

111
00:12:34.833 --> 00:12:37.041
but you were willing
to trade my life for it.

112
00:12:37.708 --> 00:12:40.791
You almost lost me to Voleth Meir.
You almost lost Geralt.

113
00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:41.916
- It was...
- I know.

114
00:12:43.125 --> 00:12:45.083
Well, if you knew, why did you do it?

115
00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.166
Because... I'd given up.

116
00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:53.750
But I'll never make that mistake again.

117
00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.208
Wish I had more for you,
but the Squirrels hit Henselt's convoy.

118
00:13:07.791 --> 00:13:10.500
Look at these.
Potatoes the size of gnome nuts.

119
00:13:11.083 --> 00:13:12.750
Did they attack your convoy as well?

120
00:13:12.833 --> 00:13:15.791
I'd like
to see them fuckin' try it!

121
00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:18.500
The elves' gripe is with the kings,
not us.

122
00:13:18.583 --> 00:13:21.583
They're just trying to soften the North
for the grand cock of Nilfgaard.

123
00:13:22.166 --> 00:13:25.541
Nilfgaard gave elves refuge,
and now they're fighting on their behalf.

124
00:13:26.625 --> 00:13:29.541
Amazing what people will do
when you give them a second chance.

125
00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:35.625
Hold on.

126
00:13:36.458 --> 00:13:37.458
Hold on!

127
00:13:37.958 --> 00:13:39.250
Are you two fuckin' again?

128
00:13:40.166 --> 00:13:41.666
Subtle, Yarpen.

129
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:44.125
Who would blame you?

130
00:13:44.208 --> 00:13:45.750
Spring's almost here.

131
00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:47.916
Ah, the whole world's wakin' up.

132
00:13:48.583 --> 00:13:51.541
Our Belleteyn festival is just
down the valley. You should come.

133
00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:52.625
I'd love to.

134
00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:54.125
- It's not safe.
- Bad idea.

135
00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:57.083
No one's asked about me in months.

136
00:13:57.166 --> 00:13:59.083
And everyone will be in costume.

137
00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.541
And... I was born on Belleteyn.

138
00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:06.416
Ah! You'd have had a shot
at bein' May Queen.

139
00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:09.500
Except my niece's beard
is comin' in nice and full this year.

140
00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:13.833
Just say yes, already!

141
00:14:14.541 --> 00:14:17.166
About time for a fuckin' thaw round here.

142
00:14:19.041 --> 00:14:20.541
I promise I'll be safe.

143
00:14:54.375 --> 00:14:56.875
Now see how you like my new pet.

144
00:15:06.750 --> 00:15:08.750
- Hmm!
- What is that thing?

145
00:15:10.791 --> 00:15:13.708
I should have warned you before,
you elven mutt.

146
00:15:14.333 --> 00:15:18.500
That jackapace is trained
to smell your kind from a league away.

147
00:15:19.625 --> 00:15:21.750
Then I've come
to the right place.

148
00:15:21.833 --> 00:15:24.041
Show yourself.

149
00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:28.041
Or I open that and you can be its dinner.

150
00:15:31.625 --> 00:15:34.000
I need to find a girl with elven blood.

151
00:15:36.083 --> 00:15:38.416
All my jacky needs is a scent.

152
00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.625
Lock of hair, piece of clothin'...

153
00:15:40.708 --> 00:15:42.166
I'll do you one better.

154
00:15:47.458 --> 00:15:49.416
Put that fucking thing away.

155
00:15:56.083 --> 00:15:57.083
How much?

156
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.166
Gage, take your best fighters
and head west to Maribor.

157
00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:17.083
Filavandrel, take yours south to Caed Dhu.

158
00:16:18.125 --> 00:16:19.125
She is out there.

159
00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:22.958
Have there been sightings,
or are we chasing more rumors?

160
00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:24.208
We don't know

161
00:16:25.458 --> 00:16:26.958
if Cirilla has Elder Blood.

162
00:16:27.041 --> 00:16:28.791
We're basing it all
on the words of...

163
00:16:29.541 --> 00:16:32.958
of some mage
who came and went just as fast.

164
00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:35.708
You have your orders.

165
00:16:41.416 --> 00:16:44.750
I want to kill them all
for what they have done to your child.

166
00:16:45.708 --> 00:16:46.708
Our hope.

167
00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.250
But, sister, it is not enough.

168
00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.458
My aim has not wavered.

169
00:16:54.083 --> 00:16:55.708
I will find Dol Blathanna.

170
00:16:55.791 --> 00:16:59.916
But how? Where?
There is no sanctuary left for elves here.

171
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.958
All will become clear
once we have Cirilla. She is our new hope.

172
00:17:04.875 --> 00:17:05.958
Do you doubt me?

173
00:17:06.458 --> 00:17:09.041
- Wake up! Hurry!
- Move the carts out!

174
00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:10.750
The others are starting to.

175
00:17:10.833 --> 00:17:13.875
Gallatin and the Scoia'tael, they're back!

176
00:17:14.541 --> 00:17:16.416
- It's not good.
- We need help!

177
00:17:17.791 --> 00:17:18.666
Get the healer.

178
00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:20.541
- I need help!
- Help!

179
00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:29.708
He doesn't need you to play nursemaid.

180
00:17:29.791 --> 00:17:31.500
He needs you to play soldier.

181
00:17:35.875 --> 00:17:36.750
Fuck.

182
00:17:36.833 --> 00:17:38.583
Leave it! It's spent.

183
00:17:38.666 --> 00:17:39.666
Needed.

184
00:17:44.458 --> 00:17:47.375
Let me know if you plan
to start holding weapons back next,

185
00:17:47.458 --> 00:17:50.041
leaving unarmed Squirrels
to fight for our freedom.

186
00:17:50.125 --> 00:17:52.916
I told you. I've given you
all the fighters I can spare.

187
00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.791
We both know that's bullshit.

188
00:17:54.875 --> 00:17:56.916
Your best fighters
are running secret missions

189
00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.166
to who the fuck knows where,
while the rest of us are out there,

190
00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:02.416
following orders, attacking convoys,

191
00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:04.666
doing the work to get our land back.

192
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.875
Doing the bidding
of yet another self-important human.

193
00:18:07.958 --> 00:18:10.750
You think I give a shit
about that White Flame nonsense?

194
00:18:10.833 --> 00:18:15.000
I give a shit about food in my stomach
and a place to call home.

195
00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:19.000
I have plans, and they don't involve dying
in the woods because of your selfishness.

196
00:18:19.083 --> 00:18:22.375
- Plans with Nilfgaard?
- What don't you get?

197
00:18:22.458 --> 00:18:26.333
If Nilfgaard takes the North,
elves are free everywhere.

198
00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:29.083
The whole Continent is our Dol Blathanna.

199
00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:32.000
We tried sharing the Continent
for centuries.

200
00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:37.125
If there's to be another genocide,
this time, it'll be the humans'.

201
00:18:41.125 --> 00:18:45.125
You keep spouting off
about ancient times, prophecies.

202
00:18:45.916 --> 00:18:48.500
I don't know
what you're looking for out there.

203
00:18:48.583 --> 00:18:50.625
But you want to keep elves alive?

204
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Here we are.

205
00:19:03.125 --> 00:19:06.458
You promised me a princess.

206
00:19:06.541 --> 00:19:10.166
Now every king knows about her,
thanks to Tissaia de Vries.

207
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:13.625
It's not a good look, Dijkstra.
You swore Cirilla would be mine.

208
00:19:13.708 --> 00:19:16.083
Perhaps a tad quieter, your Highness.

209
00:19:16.166 --> 00:19:18.625
We wouldn't want your beloved
to catch wind.

210
00:19:24.416 --> 00:19:26.916
Being the king used to mean something.

211
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.500
It's been six months.
What have you got to show for it?

212
00:19:29.583 --> 00:19:31.250
Excuses, expenses,

213
00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:34.166
but no sign of the new princess
you wanted me to marry.

214
00:19:34.666 --> 00:19:37.750
Sir, our attention has been diverted
because of the Squirrels.

215
00:19:37.833 --> 00:19:39.166
Oh, yet more excuses.

216
00:19:39.250 --> 00:19:41.416
Don't even get me started
on those bastards.

217
00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:44.000
Blaming us for murdering
that stupid elven baby.

218
00:19:46.125 --> 00:19:47.666
That definitely wasn't us?

219
00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:53.875
You have the North's largest army
and spy network.

220
00:19:54.458 --> 00:19:56.500
We are the most feared kingdom
of the North.

221
00:19:56.583 --> 00:19:59.500
What do I have to show for it?

222
00:19:59.583 --> 00:20:01.833
A spy master who can't find one girl.

223
00:20:01.916 --> 00:20:04.083
No. It's time for a change.

224
00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:06.625
I've decided
to put my best person on it.

225
00:20:06.708 --> 00:20:08.125
Someone who I can trust.

226
00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:09.750
Radovid!

227
00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:12.333
What's that?

228
00:20:13.833 --> 00:20:14.833
Whoo!

229
00:20:17.833 --> 00:20:18.875
Oh.

230
00:20:22.291 --> 00:20:24.375
The king's baby brother?

231
00:20:26.041 --> 00:20:29.041
Now we have to chaperone
that royal seed-waste too?

232
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.750
No, it's all for show.

233
00:20:32.250 --> 00:20:35.291
Vizimir just needs to remind everyone
who wears the crown.

234
00:20:35.958 --> 00:20:38.208
He wears it thanks to us.

235
00:20:39.666 --> 00:20:42.000
By gods, we've been doing this
too long, Dijkstra.

236
00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:44.333
There's no such thing.

237
00:20:44.833 --> 00:20:46.750
Our alliance, however old,

238
00:20:47.916 --> 00:20:48.916
keeps us young.

239
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:53.958
Now, as for Prince Seed-waste,

240
00:20:54.833 --> 00:20:56.250
boulder, parchment, dagger.

241
00:20:57.333 --> 00:20:58.458
Absolutely not.

242
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:01.875
I was the one who seduced
the Lyrian baroness last month,

243
00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:04.500
and the only secret she was hiding
was syphilis.

244
00:21:04.583 --> 00:21:08.416
And that's worse than the week I spent
perched over a shit-filled moat in Temeria

245
00:21:08.500 --> 00:21:10.375
while they debated timber prices?

246
00:21:13.458 --> 00:21:14.458
Fair.

247
00:21:15.916 --> 00:21:19.208
Perhaps I can order someone to babysit
the prince while he looks for the girl.

248
00:21:19.291 --> 00:21:21.708
Mmm. We don't trust anyone else.

249
00:21:27.750 --> 00:21:28.833
Hmm.

250
00:21:30.291 --> 00:21:32.291
If I do this...

251
00:21:34.375 --> 00:21:37.375
I'll be the only one giving orders
when I get back.

252
00:21:52.166 --> 00:21:55.750
I've never been to a Belleteyn
festival outside of Cintra before.

253
00:21:56.541 --> 00:22:00.916
You know, this one year, Sir Lazlo tried
to jump the bonfire in full armor.

254
00:22:04.458 --> 00:22:05.541
What do you think?

255
00:22:07.833 --> 00:22:11.083
I think you need to hide your hair
and mask your eyes.

256
00:22:13.666 --> 00:22:15.916
Would it kill you to say,
"You look lovely"?

257
00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:18.208
Ciri.

258
00:22:21.291 --> 00:22:23.000
I knew this was a bad idea.

259
00:22:37.583 --> 00:22:38.708
You look lovely.

260
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:05.250
Whoa!

261
00:23:09.291 --> 00:23:11.833
- Stay close.
- Should we, uh, find the ale tent?

262
00:23:14.875 --> 00:23:16.041
Read my mind.

263
00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:18.958
Cods, I've missed this.

264
00:23:19.041 --> 00:23:21.041
- I'm going dancing.
- Be safe.

265
00:23:26.791 --> 00:23:30.166
Look at what happens
when we let her have one good night.

266
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:34.375
Let's not pretend your motivations
aren't entirely unselfish, Yennefer.

267
00:23:35.708 --> 00:23:37.208
Play "Old Times"!

268
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:40.166
Happy birthday to you too.

269
00:23:43.541 --> 00:23:44.833
You remembered.

270
00:23:44.916 --> 00:23:46.416
I don't forget much.

271
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.791
So you remember our good nights.

272
00:23:51.916 --> 00:23:53.125
After the djinn.

273
00:23:56.708 --> 00:23:58.291
The library in Kovir.

274
00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:02.333
So much for staying quiet.

275
00:24:04.875 --> 00:24:05.875
The farmhouse.

276
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:07.750
In Murivel.

277
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.666
The overnight carriage ride
from Ellander to Moën.

278
00:24:14.708 --> 00:24:15.916
And the ride back.

279
00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:19.375
Don't forget the ride back.

280
00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:23.125
How could I? That would be like
forgetting our night in Caingorn.

281
00:24:23.208 --> 00:24:24.208
Ah!

282
00:24:24.958 --> 00:24:26.250
That dragon hunt.

283
00:24:28.916 --> 00:24:30.583
Those nights were amazing.

284
00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:33.541
- But the mornings...
- They were lonely.

285
00:24:35.875 --> 00:24:37.250
You often left before dawn.

286
00:24:37.833 --> 00:24:39.041
Or you did.

287
00:24:42.708 --> 00:24:44.708
I know why I left, but why did you?

288
00:24:47.375 --> 00:24:49.541
Scared of what would happen
if we really tried?

289
00:24:57.166 --> 00:24:59.583
I was unsure
if it was actually what I wanted.

290
00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.708
Not just some trick of the djinn's magic.

291
00:25:06.708 --> 00:25:07.708
And now?

292
00:25:09.916 --> 00:25:11.333
Let's go in the maze!

293
00:25:12.875 --> 00:25:13.875
Come on!

294
00:25:21.625 --> 00:25:22.625
Come on!

295
00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:29.750
- Run!
- Run!

296
00:26:29.833 --> 00:26:30.916
Ciri.

297
00:26:33.666 --> 00:26:34.666
Ciri!

298
00:26:35.833 --> 00:26:36.833
Ciri!

299
00:26:37.583 --> 00:26:38.583
Ciri!

300
00:26:41.625 --> 00:26:42.625
Ciri!

301
00:26:43.875 --> 00:26:44.916
Yennefer!

302
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:47.500
Geralt!

303
00:26:51.916 --> 00:26:52.916
Geralt!

304
00:26:53.333 --> 00:26:54.375
Yennefer!

305
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:48.750
Geralt!

306
00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:16.583
- We'll find another home.
- I liked this one.

307
00:28:17.458 --> 00:28:18.458
We all did.

308
00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:23.083
- How did that thing find us?
- A jackapace hunts by scent.

309
00:28:23.666 --> 00:28:26.750
- It found Ciri because it knew her.
- Her scent? How?

310
00:28:26.833 --> 00:28:29.833
Vesemir told me that Rience
stole Ciri's blood from Kaer Morhen.

311
00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:32.833
He must have used the blood
as a scent marker.

312
00:28:32.916 --> 00:28:34.875
So wherever we go,
he'll find us?

313
00:28:34.958 --> 00:28:37.458
Yes. Unless we find him first.

314
00:28:37.541 --> 00:28:38.583
We draw him out.

315
00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:43.125
We give him the thing he wants most.

316
00:28:44.916 --> 00:28:45.916
Me.

317
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:52.083
Look, I'm sorry. I wouldn't have
invited you if I knew it weren't safe.

318
00:28:52.166 --> 00:28:55.625
We know. But now you can make it up to us.

319
00:28:55.708 --> 00:28:57.791
You have a caravan leaving tomorrow,
don't you?

320
00:28:57.875 --> 00:29:00.166
- Aye. To Hagge.
- I want to go with you.

321
00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:02.125
- By yourself?
- Not quite.

322
00:29:02.208 --> 00:29:03.541
We'll be there too.

323
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:06.458
But it's important
no one knows that.

324
00:29:06.541 --> 00:29:09.458
Or else this plan isn't going to work.

325
00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:12.750
Count me in. Tell me what I need to do.

326
00:29:12.833 --> 00:29:16.708
There's only one monster handler
reckless enough to cage a jackapace.

327
00:29:16.791 --> 00:29:19.125
Name's Veldhoek.

328
00:29:19.208 --> 00:29:21.875
- Oh...
- Nasty fellow with a nasty habit.

329
00:29:22.583 --> 00:29:24.625
Rience hired Veldhoek to find me.

330
00:29:24.708 --> 00:29:26.666
Now they'll want
to hear about your convoy.

331
00:29:28.375 --> 00:29:30.833
We need you to complain
about the spoilt brat

332
00:29:30.916 --> 00:29:32.458
who ruined Belleteyn for everyone.

333
00:29:32.541 --> 00:29:36.041
And what's worse, now I have to haul
that ivy-eyed brat's pale arse

334
00:29:36.125 --> 00:29:38.166
all the way to Aedirn with my caravan.

335
00:29:38.666 --> 00:29:42.083
Gonna charge them double if I have to
put up with any of her yappery.

336
00:29:45.375 --> 00:29:46.875
Come on, you elven mutt.

337
00:29:49.291 --> 00:29:51.083
They'll know
who you're talking about.

338
00:29:53.458 --> 00:29:55.500
And how much
that information is worth.

339
00:29:55.583 --> 00:29:58.041
- Enjoy your reward.
- Hold up, buttercup.

340
00:29:58.125 --> 00:30:01.875
You think this mage is gonna believe
you'd let Ciri ride without an escort?

341
00:30:01.958 --> 00:30:04.250
She'll be traveling with someone we trust.

342
00:30:04.333 --> 00:30:05.458
Someone...

343
00:30:06.166 --> 00:30:07.541
seemingly innocuous.

344
00:30:08.375 --> 00:30:10.166
Oh, come on! No...

345
00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:12.458
It was one time!

346
00:30:12.541 --> 00:30:15.083
Admittedly, with many different people.

347
00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:16.708
And it meant nothing!

348
00:30:16.791 --> 00:30:19.708
I mean, these aren't even mine!

349
00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:23.208
Did you think you were the only one
having some fun on the side,

350
00:30:23.291 --> 00:30:26.000
you lying, wretched son of the devil?

351
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:27.750
Well...

352
00:30:28.458 --> 00:30:30.375
yeah, kinda!

353
00:30:31.125 --> 00:30:34.916
This is what we do, my sweet.
We are creatives.

354
00:30:35.625 --> 00:30:36.916
Freethinkers.

355
00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.958
- All is fair!
- Is it, though?

356
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:40.166
Ah! Oh!

357
00:30:40.250 --> 00:30:45.375
Ooh! When will magic, sexy women
just stop jumping out at me?

358
00:30:45.458 --> 00:30:47.333
Usually it's you coming at me from above.

359
00:30:47.416 --> 00:30:49.583
- She doesn't have a crossbow, does she?
- No!

360
00:30:51.083 --> 00:30:53.208
Possibly. Yeah, no,
I wouldn't rule it out.

361
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:54.500
No crossbows!

362
00:30:54.583 --> 00:30:56.500
And you can fuckin' have him!

363
00:30:56.583 --> 00:30:58.208
And his pox-marked cock!

364
00:30:58.291 --> 00:31:00.250
Now who's lying, Vespula?

365
00:31:00.333 --> 00:31:02.958
We've lost patience, Sandpiper.

366
00:31:03.833 --> 00:31:07.333
- I... I'm doing everything that I can. I...
- You're doing nothing.

367
00:31:07.416 --> 00:31:09.250
Except fucking people over.

368
00:31:10.875 --> 00:31:13.000
We invested a lot in your operations.

369
00:31:13.083 --> 00:31:15.958
And we've gotten nothing in return.

370
00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.125
Dijkstra and I are ready to cut you loose.

371
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:23.833
But King Vizimir is more forgiving.

372
00:31:23.916 --> 00:31:26.791
He's ready to welcome the girl
with open arms. Shall we?

373
00:31:27.291 --> 00:31:29.458
Yeah, and an open pair of pantaloons.

374
00:31:29.541 --> 00:31:30.791
Yeah... Uh, no, darling...

375
00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:32.291
No! Look at me.

376
00:31:32.375 --> 00:31:35.833
Look at my eyes.
There is no need to harm the innocent!

377
00:31:35.916 --> 00:31:36.958
No, no, no, don't!

378
00:31:37.041 --> 00:31:38.041
No...

379
00:31:40.916 --> 00:31:44.500
I thought I left you cradling
a pint of ale some distance away.

380
00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:47.458
- You did. I got bored.
- Hmm. Oh.

381
00:31:49.666 --> 00:31:53.625
How fortunate that is.
I've long wanted to see you in person.

382
00:31:55.041 --> 00:31:56.708
"Song of the Seven" is my favorite.

383
00:31:56.791 --> 00:31:59.833
Yeah. That's... slightly ironic,
but thank you.

384
00:31:59.916 --> 00:32:01.666
You see? People like me.

385
00:32:02.375 --> 00:32:04.791
I've got fans.
Sorry, I didn't quite catch your name.

386
00:32:04.875 --> 00:32:06.083
- Uh, Radovid.
- Right.

387
00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:07.166
Comma, Prince.

388
00:32:07.583 --> 00:32:10.208
Comma, wow. Whoa... wow. You're...

389
00:32:10.291 --> 00:32:13.541
Ooh! The Prince of Redania.

390
00:32:13.625 --> 00:32:16.208
Fuck, I don't really know
what I'm supposed to... Bow?

391
00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:19.375
Or curtsy, or... Been holding your hand
a very long time. I'm so sorry.

392
00:32:19.458 --> 00:32:23.000
Listen, I wish I could help you, truly.
But...

393
00:32:23.083 --> 00:32:25.916
- But nothing, Sandpiper...
- If I may offer a thought.

394
00:32:26.416 --> 00:32:29.750
Ah, this poor Cirilla girl
has enemies everywhere,

395
00:32:29.833 --> 00:32:33.083
and, truth be told,
Redania's not a bad place.

396
00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:36.208
Bit cold in the winter
and humid in the summer,

397
00:32:36.291 --> 00:32:38.500
but the food is spectacular.

398
00:32:38.583 --> 00:32:40.708
And my brother's not bad.

399
00:32:41.416 --> 00:32:42.500
As monarchs go.

400
00:32:44.916 --> 00:32:48.291
Redania may not be perfect,
but it's her least bad option.

401
00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:52.291
You could be our royal bard.

402
00:32:52.375 --> 00:32:53.375
Uh... Ha, ha!

403
00:32:53.458 --> 00:32:57.333
No. No, a staid life at court
is not for me.

404
00:32:57.416 --> 00:33:00.541
If your time at court's been staid,
you've been doing it wrong.

405
00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.791
Either deliver the girl,

406
00:33:06.875 --> 00:33:09.750
or we will single-handedly undo

407
00:33:09.833 --> 00:33:12.583
every good deed
you have done for the elves.

408
00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:15.750
We will kill them all.

409
00:33:15.833 --> 00:33:17.541
- Yeah, yeah, I got the gist.
- Mmm.

410
00:33:18.458 --> 00:33:21.500
I've got business in town
before we portal back to Tretogor.

411
00:33:21.583 --> 00:33:24.166
You... have five days.

412
00:33:31.958 --> 00:33:34.541
Oi, you lute-playin' walloper!

413
00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:38.000
Again with this fresh hell...

414
00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:40.166
Mr. Zigrin!

415
00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.375
- Julian Alfred Pankratz.
- Yeah, I know. I know.

416
00:33:45.458 --> 00:33:47.125
I fucking know!

417
00:33:47.208 --> 00:33:49.625
I know you know. It's a rule of threes
thing. Has to be done.

418
00:33:49.708 --> 00:33:51.208
What can I do for you, Yarpen?

419
00:33:51.291 --> 00:33:54.125
I've got ears and good taste, so... nothin'.

420
00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:57.958
But... your friends need help.

421
00:34:02.791 --> 00:34:04.500
Of course they do.

422
00:34:05.458 --> 00:34:07.208
Bait!

423
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:09.708
I rode for days to get here,

424
00:34:09.791 --> 00:34:11.791
battling hunger, battling the elements,

425
00:34:11.875 --> 00:34:15.291
only to discover upon my arrival
that I'm being used as...

426
00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:16.375
- Jaskier, me.
- ...bait.

427
00:34:16.458 --> 00:34:18.750
I am the bait. Rience is after me.

428
00:34:18.833 --> 00:34:22.791
Yes, which means he wants you alive,
and me very much not alive.

429
00:34:22.875 --> 00:34:24.000
You see my anxiety?

430
00:34:24.583 --> 00:34:26.666
We're not gonna let
anything happen to you.

431
00:34:26.750 --> 00:34:29.416
I saved your arse once.
I can do it again, Pankratz.

432
00:34:30.041 --> 00:34:31.666
You didn't save me...

433
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:34.375
She didn't save me. She...

434
00:34:34.458 --> 00:34:35.500
She didn't!

435
00:34:36.583 --> 00:34:38.583
But seriously,
you are gonna save me, right?

436
00:34:39.333 --> 00:34:41.250
We won't make Hagge by sunset.

437
00:34:43.583 --> 00:34:45.083
We should make camp here.

438
00:35:09.125 --> 00:35:10.458
What is this place?

439
00:35:11.083 --> 00:35:12.416
It's Shaerrawedd.

440
00:35:12.916 --> 00:35:16.000
Tread lightly.
This land is full of stories.

441
00:35:17.208 --> 00:35:20.083
Never seen
so many wild roses in one place.

442
00:35:21.208 --> 00:35:22.333
They're beautiful.

443
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.250
Their story, sadly, is not.

444
00:35:27.666 --> 00:35:28.750
Aelirenn.

445
00:35:29.875 --> 00:35:33.625
A brave and inspiring elven warrior
who thought she could defeat the humans.

446
00:35:35.583 --> 00:35:36.625
She was wrong.

447
00:35:37.458 --> 00:35:39.958
A rather condensed version of the story.

448
00:35:42.041 --> 00:35:43.541
And what's yours, then?

449
00:35:44.708 --> 00:35:47.458
After the Conjunction, humans arrived.

450
00:35:48.750 --> 00:35:52.041
The elves thought
the humans were just a nuisance,

451
00:35:52.708 --> 00:35:54.750
like a plague of locusts or a drought.

452
00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:57.875
That they would die off
in the blink of an elven eye.

453
00:35:58.791 --> 00:36:00.833
But the humans kept multiplying.

454
00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.041
And killing.

455
00:36:05.708 --> 00:36:08.041
Aelirenn knew
the threat wasn't going away.

456
00:36:08.916 --> 00:36:12.916
So she rallied all of the young elves
to fight, at Shaerrawedd.

457
00:36:16.041 --> 00:36:18.416
Sounds like she fought
for what she believed in.

458
00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:20.500
To protect her people.

459
00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.625
She did fight
for what she believed in.

460
00:36:24.375 --> 00:36:26.916
She led those young
and passionate elves to war.

461
00:36:29.375 --> 00:36:30.916
They revered this place.

462
00:36:32.458 --> 00:36:34.125
This is where they fought.

463
00:36:35.083 --> 00:36:36.333
They fought for her.

464
00:36:36.833 --> 00:36:40.791
And they died with her name on their lips
and their honor and integrity intact.

465
00:36:43.375 --> 00:36:46.500
And in doing so, they condemned
their species to annihilation.

466
00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:52.375
She led them all to their deaths.

467
00:36:54.375 --> 00:36:55.875
Neutrality.

468
00:36:55.958 --> 00:36:57.583
It won't get you a statue.

469
00:36:58.666 --> 00:37:01.125
But it'll certainly help
in keeping you alive.

470
00:37:11.041 --> 00:37:13.083
- And fight!
- Weak humans!

471
00:37:14.041 --> 00:37:16.500
- Ahh! That'll teach them!
- Yeah!

472
00:37:16.583 --> 00:37:19.708
When will the humans learn
to travel with more guards?

473
00:37:19.791 --> 00:37:21.833
- How many men did you kill?
- Eat.

474
00:37:21.916 --> 00:37:23.708
- Here they are.
- Here.

475
00:37:23.791 --> 00:37:26.125
Got to fatten you up.
Need you back out there.

476
00:37:26.208 --> 00:37:28.000
- Well done, brother.
- Here.

477
00:37:29.583 --> 00:37:30.583
Eat.

478
00:37:33.666 --> 00:37:37.000
- Food goes to the ones who fought.
- We fight just like you.

479
00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:38.500
Then eat what you captured.

480
00:37:38.583 --> 00:37:41.041
All elves share equally.

481
00:37:41.666 --> 00:37:43.791
Otherwise,
we're no better than the humans.

482
00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:54.500
All elves must risk equally, as well.

483
00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.041
You were right.

484
00:37:58.125 --> 00:38:01.083
Our Scoia'tael forces should be united.

485
00:38:01.791 --> 00:38:02.875
In purpose,

486
00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.500
but also in action.

487
00:38:05.291 --> 00:38:07.166
Must've been an eventful morning.

488
00:38:07.666 --> 00:38:09.750
What did you see out there
to change your mind?

489
00:38:09.833 --> 00:38:13.750
Nothing. I simply had time
to consider your position.

490
00:38:15.041 --> 00:38:17.916
We have different ideas
of what Dol Blathanna looks like.

491
00:38:18.625 --> 00:38:19.916
But we both want a home.

492
00:38:20.625 --> 00:38:22.500
And we can find it faster together.

493
00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:33.583
You should get out of that tent
more often.

494
00:38:33.666 --> 00:38:34.708
Hmm.

495
00:38:36.208 --> 00:38:38.500
Tomorrow, we make our next move.

496
00:38:39.916 --> 00:38:42.375
I'll be by your side. As long as it takes.

497
00:39:06.250 --> 00:39:08.000
- Ciri!
- Ciri.

498
00:39:08.083 --> 00:39:10.500
You two really think
I'm that shitty of a guard?

499
00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.291
I had another dream.

500
00:39:18.416 --> 00:39:19.541
A nightmare?

501
00:39:20.875 --> 00:39:22.541
No, it wasn't frightening.

502
00:39:23.041 --> 00:39:25.583
Just couldn't sleep
thinking about Aelirenn.

503
00:39:26.083 --> 00:39:27.208
And my grandmother.

504
00:39:28.041 --> 00:39:29.583
They lived centuries apart,

505
00:39:29.666 --> 00:39:31.666
but burned with the exact same mission.

506
00:39:34.541 --> 00:39:36.750
Wipe the other species off the Continent.

507
00:39:46.166 --> 00:39:47.791
When I finally fell asleep,

508
00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
it came to me.

509
00:39:53.625 --> 00:39:55.708
If I can offer something different...

510
00:39:58.208 --> 00:40:01.375
A way forward that doesn't divide,
but unites.

511
00:40:02.958 --> 00:40:04.875
I'm part elf, I'm part human.

512
00:40:04.958 --> 00:40:08.750
I understand both because I am both,
and that is my strength.

513
00:40:09.250 --> 00:40:11.333
I understand what you're saying.

514
00:40:13.333 --> 00:40:14.750
History, it...

515
00:40:15.916 --> 00:40:17.708
...has a way of repeating itself.

516
00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:20.125
Even for the idealistic.

517
00:40:20.208 --> 00:40:24.000
You say Aelirenn's idealism is what led
to the massacre of the young elves,

518
00:40:24.083 --> 00:40:28.375
but maybe if her elders had supported her
instead of abandoning her,

519
00:40:28.458 --> 00:40:29.458
they could've won.

520
00:40:31.041 --> 00:40:34.250
Yen, you overheard something
when you were taken prisoner by the elves.

521
00:40:34.333 --> 00:40:36.125
You told me they had a saying.

522
00:40:42.208 --> 00:40:44.250
What has been need not always be.

523
00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.625
Francesca, the elven queen,

524
00:40:48.333 --> 00:40:51.000
she believed she could offer
something more to her people.

525
00:40:51.583 --> 00:40:52.708
And so do I.

526
00:40:54.625 --> 00:40:58.458
Geralt, you taught me how to fight.
Just like Calanthe.

527
00:40:58.541 --> 00:41:02.250
And Yen, you're teaching me how
to harness my powers. Like Mousesack.

528
00:41:03.083 --> 00:41:06.291
What if this is the reason
destiny brought us together?

529
00:41:08.125 --> 00:41:11.625
Nenneke said I have the power
to change the cycle of hatred.

530
00:41:12.791 --> 00:41:14.000
And I want to.

531
00:41:15.791 --> 00:41:19.333
To be the balance between kings and mages,
and to align the Continent,

532
00:41:19.416 --> 00:41:22.333
instead of constantly pitting parts
against each other.

533
00:41:22.875 --> 00:41:27.041
Because I am sick and tired
of destruction and loss.

534
00:41:32.125 --> 00:41:33.833
I don't doubt you, Ciri.

535
00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.458
I do doubt the world, though.

536
00:41:39.875 --> 00:41:41.916
It...

537
00:41:46.291 --> 00:41:48.041
Let's go. Now.

538
00:41:53.083 --> 00:41:54.666
We'll be right here.

539
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Are you ready?

540
00:42:10.625 --> 00:42:13.833
- How long do we wait?
- Until she draws them out.

541
00:42:16.333 --> 00:42:18.333
She can do this.

542
00:42:27.833 --> 00:42:29.416
Cirilla of Cintra.

543
00:42:31.125 --> 00:42:32.500
Alone at last.

544
00:42:33.458 --> 00:42:36.916
Well, not quite.
I've brought more friends this time.

545
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:56.708
Last time, I beat you with my wits.
This time, you meet my magic.

546
00:43:12.541 --> 00:43:14.392
- With me!
- Get in there, lads!

547
00:43:14.416 --> 00:43:15.625
I like my odds.

548
00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:17.666
I like our odds better!

549
00:43:22.291 --> 00:43:23.625
This is too easy!

550
00:43:29.583 --> 00:43:30.958
Geralt!

551
00:43:31.041 --> 00:43:32.041
Fuck!

552
00:43:33.208 --> 00:43:34.458
Go!

553
00:43:54.291 --> 00:43:55.416
Can you keep it open?

554
00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:57.166
Some new strain of Chaotic insanity.

555
00:43:58.291 --> 00:44:01.166
But I will.
We just need to wait for Geralt.

556
00:44:02.083 --> 00:44:04.291
Archers! Get down!

557
00:44:14.041 --> 00:44:16.875
- Where the fuck is the caravan?
- She's all that matters.

558
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:26.708
- You have your orders. Go.
- What?

559
00:44:27.291 --> 00:44:28.291
Shit!

560
00:44:37.708 --> 00:44:38.708
Keep it open.

561
00:44:38.791 --> 00:44:40.231
- Follow me!
- Right!

562
00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:53.291
You don't look so special.

563
00:44:53.916 --> 00:44:55.250
Motherfucker!

564
00:44:58.125 --> 00:44:59.625
You bastard!

565
00:45:02.083 --> 00:45:03.916
- Move!
- Come on.

566
00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.833
Come on, I got you. I got you.

567
00:45:09.666 --> 00:45:11.791
You call yourself an elf.

568
00:45:12.291 --> 00:45:14.125
She's Hen Ichaer.

569
00:45:14.208 --> 00:45:15.833
- And she belongs with...
- Me!

570
00:45:19.375 --> 00:45:21.500
We need to
get her out of here!

571
00:45:21.583 --> 00:45:22.791
Come on, Geralt.

572
00:45:28.708 --> 00:45:30.375
Your mage is out of her depth.

573
00:45:53.041 --> 00:45:55.583
The elves came for Ciri.

574
00:45:58.958 --> 00:46:00.000
This way!

575
00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:02.500
Move!

576
00:46:32.791 --> 00:46:34.583
Come on. She could be in here!

577
00:46:34.666 --> 00:46:35.750
You two, with me!

578
00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:43.791
You're gonna fuckin' die,
Squirrels!

579
00:46:43.875 --> 00:46:45.666
Go. Fall back.

580
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:47.583
- Fall back!
- Fall back!

581
00:46:47.666 --> 00:46:49.333
- Fall back! Quick!
- Follow me!

582
00:46:49.416 --> 00:46:51.375
Come on, come on. Wake up.
Come on, get up.

583
00:46:56.083 --> 00:46:57.208
Oh!

584
00:46:57.291 --> 00:46:58.291
Oh, ho-ho!

585
00:47:00.875 --> 00:47:02.500
I've got her! I've got her!

586
00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:06.583
No! No!

587
00:47:06.666 --> 00:47:07.750
No!

588
00:47:08.291 --> 00:47:09.166
We have to go.

589
00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:10.791
- Fall back!
- Careful.

590
00:47:12.416 --> 00:47:16.250
Oh, if I die, promise me
Valdo Marx will not play at my funeral.

591
00:47:17.083 --> 00:47:18.083
You'll be fine.

592
00:47:19.125 --> 00:47:20.875
Your lute, on the other hand,

593
00:47:21.541 --> 00:47:22.875
has seen better days.

594
00:47:23.875 --> 00:47:24.958
You helped my men.

595
00:47:25.541 --> 00:47:27.583
You have my thanks.

596
00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.625
Jaskier.

597
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:33.708
- You're the bravest bait that ever lived.
- Whew!

598
00:47:34.375 --> 00:47:36.666
You owe me one!

599
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:39.500
Promise me we will never do that again.

600
00:47:40.583 --> 00:47:43.083
Thank you, Jaskier.

601
00:47:51.083 --> 00:47:54.416
You said the portal was different
from anything you've experienced.

602
00:47:55.791 --> 00:47:58.500
- What did you mean?
- It was dark.

603
00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:00.666
It took me over.

604
00:48:02.875 --> 00:48:04.708
I can still feel its residue.

605
00:48:05.666 --> 00:48:08.250
Rience isn't the only rogue mage
we're dealing with.

606
00:48:09.250 --> 00:48:11.041
Someone very powerful is puppeting him.

607
00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:14.208
You need to make more progress
with Ciri's training.

608
00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:15.916
- Mmm...
- I'll work harder.

609
00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:18.166
It's not about what you can do.

610
00:48:18.958 --> 00:48:21.208
It's about what I can do. I need help.

611
00:48:21.708 --> 00:48:23.750
- If I can talk to Tissaia...
- No.

612
00:48:25.708 --> 00:48:29.541
You don't know how difficult it is
to embody power but not have access to it.

613
00:48:29.625 --> 00:48:31.750
Going to Aretuza
cannot be the only answer.

614
00:48:31.833 --> 00:48:33.625
It's the best thing for her.

615
00:48:33.708 --> 00:48:34.708
Is it?

616
00:48:37.041 --> 00:48:38.583
Come with us, then.

617
00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:40.458
Stay and make sure she's safe.

618
00:48:41.875 --> 00:48:43.291
All I want

619
00:48:44.666 --> 00:48:46.416
is for us to stay together.

620
00:48:50.791 --> 00:48:52.583
I can make this work.

621
00:48:54.041 --> 00:48:55.916
If you can find a way to trust me.

622
00:49:03.416 --> 00:49:05.791
I need to find Rience to finish him off.

623
00:49:08.208 --> 00:49:09.666
I can't go with you.

624
00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:14.166
And we can't go with you.

625
00:49:16.833 --> 00:49:18.583
Then we have to split up.

626
00:49:25.083 --> 00:49:30.291
♪ In our dirt, young Baldrin sleeps ♪

627
00:49:31.041 --> 00:49:35.375
♪ Ever sowed by human greed ♪

628
00:49:36.458 --> 00:49:40.208
♪ Brave Hogal vows on bent knee ♪

629
00:49:41.541 --> 00:49:45.541
♪ Let man-blood flood our reeds ♪

630
00:49:46.291 --> 00:49:49.875
♪ In new dirt, still Hogal dreams ♪

631
00:49:51.958 --> 00:49:54.125
♪ Of that vengeance... ♪

632
00:49:54.208 --> 00:49:56.916
She has lost her brother.

633
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.041
And I have lost a dozen more.

634
00:49:59.708 --> 00:50:02.375
We were supposed to attack
the caravan together.

635
00:50:02.458 --> 00:50:04.958
She lied to us.

636
00:50:06.333 --> 00:50:07.625
All this loss

637
00:50:08.333 --> 00:50:09.833
because of one girl.

638
00:50:25.916 --> 00:50:27.250
You knew that girl.

639
00:50:29.041 --> 00:50:31.666
Princess Cirilla... of Cintra.

640
00:50:32.958 --> 00:50:34.250
I warned them.

641
00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:36.250
She brings nothing but death.

642
00:50:36.333 --> 00:50:37.875
The problem isn't her.

643
00:50:39.333 --> 00:50:40.666
It's that one.

644
00:50:41.291 --> 00:50:43.666
I've had enough. Lost enough.

645
00:50:47.625 --> 00:50:48.875
Where are you going?

646
00:50:49.833 --> 00:50:52.041
To get help from an old friend.

647
00:50:53.708 --> 00:50:55.375
Yah!

648
00:51:11.875 --> 00:51:12.875
Geralt.

649
00:51:17.333 --> 00:51:20.000
Wherever you're going, please come back.

650
00:51:22.333 --> 00:51:23.583
As soon as you can.

651
00:51:25.875 --> 00:51:27.875
Jaskier's waiting for me in Ban Gleán.

652
00:51:29.166 --> 00:51:30.541
But we'll meet again soon.

653
00:51:50.791 --> 00:51:51.791
I've got her.

654
00:51:52.750 --> 00:51:54.250
Whatever you think of me,

655
00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.666
that's my promise to you.

656
00:51:58.791 --> 00:52:00.000
I know you do.

657
00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:07.208
- Yen, I...
- Just say this isn't goodbye for good.

658
00:52:11.833 --> 00:52:13.833
That there are more good nights to come.

659
00:52:17.291 --> 00:52:18.458
That you will...

660
00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:21.791
in whatever form...

661
00:52:23.458 --> 00:52:24.791
think of me.

662
00:52:32.333 --> 00:52:34.125
That's my promise to you.

663
00:52:53.375 --> 00:52:57.416
It has been...
an eventful few days, and...

664
00:52:58.375 --> 00:53:01.500
I've been thinking about
your... generous offer.

665
00:53:01.583 --> 00:53:03.875
- And your excuse this time is?
- I'll do it.

666
00:53:05.083 --> 00:53:07.291
Ciri's in danger. Uh...

667
00:53:07.375 --> 00:53:09.333
And so are the people around her.

668
00:53:10.250 --> 00:53:11.333
People I love.

669
00:53:12.416 --> 00:53:15.750
It would be best
if she landed somewhere... safe.

670
00:53:15.833 --> 00:53:18.458
And you make quite the case for Redania.

671
00:53:18.958 --> 00:53:23.000
For... eurgh, "settling down".

672
00:53:23.083 --> 00:53:24.375
Wonderful.

673
00:53:25.041 --> 00:53:27.375
- We can escort her back tonight.
- No.

674
00:53:30.041 --> 00:53:31.125
Not yet.

675
00:53:33.083 --> 00:53:36.791
There's a... mage with a fondness for fire.

676
00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:39.500
Rience.

677
00:53:40.291 --> 00:53:41.666
I'm familiar with his work.

678
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:42.916
Get rid of him.

679
00:53:45.625 --> 00:53:47.333
Get rid of him, and...

680
00:53:49.125 --> 00:53:51.458
you will have earned Ciri's trust.

681
00:53:52.250 --> 00:53:53.333
And Geralt's.

682
00:53:55.791 --> 00:53:56.916
And mine.

683
00:54:12.291 --> 00:54:13.791
You're good at this game.

684
00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:19.916
If you say so, Pip.

685
00:54:22.791 --> 00:54:23.791
Pip!

686
00:54:41.375 --> 00:54:42.791
Dear friend...

687
00:54:44.666 --> 00:54:46.250
I miss you already.

688
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:49.250
Or should I say, we miss you?

689
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.500
Your friend, Yennefer.

690
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:59.375
P.S., if Ciri decides
Aretuza is not to her liking,

691
00:55:00.625 --> 00:55:02.875
I have my eyes on our next home.

692
00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:06.375
A dollhouse on a squid farm.

693
00:55:17.458 --> 00:55:18.666
Dear friend...

694
00:55:21.791 --> 00:55:23.375
...you asked at Belleteyn if...

695
00:55:24.708 --> 00:55:28.458
I left after all those good nights
because I was scared.

696
00:55:30.625 --> 00:55:32.041
Perhaps I was.

697
00:55:34.666 --> 00:55:38.125
Perhaps that is what led me
to this very moment.

698
00:55:40.583 --> 00:55:43.375
Now, for the first time,

699
00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:47.500
I understand real fear.

700
00:55:50.416 --> 00:55:52.458
Never seeing you and Ciri again.

701
00:55:55.083 --> 00:55:57.416
Much is uncertain on this Continent.

702
00:56:00.666 --> 00:56:04.916
The dangers we've seen
foretell an even more menacing future.

703
00:56:20.416 --> 00:56:22.666
But, Yen, please know

704
00:56:23.625 --> 00:56:25.625
I will learn to trust you again.

705
00:56:28.333 --> 00:56:32.250
