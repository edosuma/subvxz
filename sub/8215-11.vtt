WEBVTT

00:13.240 --> 00:15.208
All right, hold up.
I got to take a leak.

00:15.240 --> 00:17.140
Dude, you
should hold it.

00:17.180 --> 00:18.545
Yeah, that's what
I'm intending.

00:18.580 --> 00:19.547
No, I-I'm
telling you.

00:19.580 --> 00:21.639
I heard about this guy
who tried to take a leak

00:21.680 --> 00:24.217
in Prospect Park, gets
arrested for exposure,

00:24.250 --> 00:26.559
and now he has to
register as a pervert.

00:26.590 --> 00:29.753
That must be tough
for you, man.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.326
Holy...

00:38.330 --> 00:39.558
Hey, Ben.

00:39.600 --> 00:42.433
What's a 12-letter word for
the theme of Paradise Lost?

00:42.470 --> 00:44.404
What kind of question is that
for a bartender?

00:45.840 --> 00:47.171
Those I got answers for.

00:47.210 --> 00:48.438
Well, those are the easy ones.

00:48.480 --> 00:50.175
Thought you knew everything,
anyway.

00:50.210 --> 00:51.199
I remember everything.

00:51.250 --> 00:53.218
Like the fact that I never read
Paradise Lost.

00:54.250 --> 00:55.478
Hey, Pete.

00:55.520 --> 00:56.748
Those drinks aren't
on the house.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.189
I can't keep covering you.

00:58.220 --> 00:59.858
Yeah, I know, I know.
I just... I rolled out

00:59.890 --> 01:01.653
and forgot my cards.
I'll get you back.

01:01.690 --> 01:03.089
You said that last time.
No, I didn't.

01:03.130 --> 01:04.825
Uh, yes, you did.
Last three times.

01:04.860 --> 01:08.091
Two months ago.
Thursday, 10:33 pm.

01:08.130 --> 01:09.768
You bought some vodka tonics
for a bunch of chicks

01:09.800 --> 01:11.119
who never even thanked you,
and then you came in

01:11.170 --> 01:12.137
three weeks later,
said your girlfriend

01:12.170 --> 01:13.364
Barbie was cheating on you,

01:13.400 --> 01:14.765
downed four shots of tequila

01:14.800 --> 01:15.892
at six bucks a pop.

01:15.940 --> 01:19.330
And then, it was what?
Sunday, a week ago, 5:43 p.m.

01:19.380 --> 01:21.507
You came in with _
your new girlfriend Justine.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.508
Said you were celebrating.

01:23.550 --> 01:24.744
Five pints, and then there was

01:24.780 --> 01:26.418
the round that you bought
for the house,

01:26.450 --> 01:28.179
which was seven white wines,
six White Russians,

01:28.220 --> 01:29.448
five gin and tonics,

01:29.490 --> 01:31.685
and, of course,
the single malt, 18 year,

01:31.720 --> 01:32.880
which I took you up on.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.251
Thank you very much for that.

01:34.290 --> 01:35.757
So that would bring
your total to...

01:35.790 --> 01:37.223
$341.30.

01:38.390 --> 01:40.449
$341.35.

01:41.430 --> 01:42.397
Pay up.

01:42.430 --> 01:43.522
I'm a cop.

01:43.570 --> 01:45.322
Don't make me_
toss you in the clink.

01:45.370 --> 01:48.430
Oh, it's... Found it.
Oh.

01:49.840 --> 01:50.864
I owe you one.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.629
341, to be exact.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.500
Hey, Al.

01:55.540 --> 01:57.269
Yeah.

01:58.550 --> 02:00.472
CARRIE:
What do we got?

02:00.520 --> 02:02.340
26-year-old female.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.743
Joggers found her
an hour ago.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.087
Name is Suzanne Mills.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.611
I'm guessing that has something
to do with why you're out here.

02:07.660 --> 02:11.221
Ms. Mills worked, until this
morning, at Platinum Select.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.922
That has everything to do
with why I'm out here.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.621
WEBSTER:
Platinum Select?

02:15.660 --> 02:18.493
The most exclusive matchmaking
service on the East Coast?

02:18.530 --> 02:19.599
Of course it is.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.937
It's not just
a matchmaking service,

02:20.970 --> 02:22.403
it's more like
the spawning ground

02:22.440 --> 02:23.862
for half the power couples
in the city.

02:23.910 --> 02:24.831
WEBSTER:
People pay

02:24.870 --> 02:28.772
Gwen Stein 50 grand to set up
these mixers

02:28.810 --> 02:31.802
with pre-screened dates
to find Mr. Right.

02:31.850 --> 02:35.809
According to her, 98.7 of her
matches end up in marriage.

02:35.850 --> 02:36.919
Heard it on The Talk.

02:36.950 --> 02:37.917
And that works?

02:37.950 --> 02:38.848
ELIOT:
Let's just say

02:38.890 --> 02:40.357
it worked for two chairmen

02:40.390 --> 02:41.687
of the Federal Reserve,

02:41.720 --> 02:43.620
a minority owner
of the Brooklyn Nets,

02:43.660 --> 02:45.821
and a former police commissioner
of New York.

02:45.860 --> 02:47.919
A who's who of people
you'd rather we not piss off.

02:47.960 --> 02:48.927
I'm just saying,

02:48.960 --> 02:51.428
this falls under
the "tread lightly" category.

02:51.470 --> 02:53.631
Uniforms canvassed the area.

02:53.670 --> 02:54.694
Uh, nobody heard

02:54.740 --> 02:55.832
or saw anything.

02:55.870 --> 02:58.304
Looks like her phone is missing.

02:58.340 --> 02:59.932
No money or credit cards
in her wallet,

02:59.980 --> 03:01.436
just her I.D.

03:01.480 --> 03:03.675
Delson here.
Okay.

03:03.710 --> 03:04.847
Bruising around the neck

03:04.880 --> 03:06.745
and petechial hemorrhaging
in the eyes

03:06.780 --> 03:08.748
would indicate strangulation.

03:08.780 --> 03:09.940
AL:
Torn blouse, unbuttoned pants.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.742
Sexual assault?

03:11.790 --> 03:14.281
Yeah, that goes along with
the strangulation M.O.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.355
For what it's worth,
there were

03:15.390 --> 03:17.255
no signs of the body
being dragged.

03:17.290 --> 03:19.258
I think she died right here.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.756
What about her shoes?

03:20.800 --> 03:22.665
She wasn't jogging,
she wasn't hiking.

03:22.700 --> 03:25.965
So, what was she doing here
this early in the morning?

03:26.000 --> 03:27.399
Meeting somebody?

03:28.470 --> 03:30.734
Sure as hell wasn't Mr. Right.

03:51.590 --> 03:53.490
I checked for similar
patterns in the area

03:53.530 --> 03:54.622
going back six months.

03:54.660 --> 03:56.560
Nothing remotely
matching this M.O.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.625
Cameras in the park?
Not a one.

03:58.670 --> 03:59.967
Good place for
a private rendezvous.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.467
What about next of kin?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.467
That's tough.

04:02.510 --> 04:03.738
What we know so far is

04:03.770 --> 04:05.431
she's from Joliet, both
her parents are dead,

04:05.470 --> 04:06.698
and no siblings.

04:06.740 --> 04:09.573
What's weird is, aside
from her boss Gwen,

04:09.610 --> 04:11.703
there's not much evidence
of anyone else in her life.

04:11.750 --> 04:13.718
Okay, keep digging.
Yeah.

04:18.690 --> 04:19.782
Hey.

04:19.820 --> 04:20.980
Hey.

04:21.020 --> 04:22.521
So...

04:22.560 --> 04:25.051
I'm thinking maybe she was
an outdoors kind of girl.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.991
There's all these topo maps.
Maybe she liked to hike.

04:28.030 --> 04:29.463
Well, people tend to

04:29.500 --> 04:30.626
hike with friends.

04:30.670 --> 04:32.297
Not me. I hike alone.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.934
Clears my head.

04:34.970 --> 04:36.938
Al, look around you.

04:36.970 --> 04:38.665
She was here a
year and a half,

04:38.710 --> 04:40.029
but there's nothing
on the walls,

04:40.080 --> 04:42.002
nothing personal.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.645
Almost like she wasn't
expecting to stay.

04:44.680 --> 04:47.012
Sounds familiar.

04:47.050 --> 04:49.518
Hey, you haven't been
to my place in a while.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.939
You ever hang that Miles Davis
print I got you?

04:51.990 --> 04:54.379
It's in a safe place.
On a wall?

04:56.460 --> 04:57.927
Uh, leaning against a wall.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.360
WEBSTER:
I think she died right here.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.732
CARRIE:
Look at her shoes.

05:08.770 --> 05:10.965
Suzanne was a six and a half.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.409
So?

05:12.440 --> 05:14.829
So these are an eight.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.099
And there's a couple more pair
in here.

05:18.150 --> 05:21.449
So maybe someone else
was living with her?

05:21.480 --> 05:23.414
Maybe.

05:23.450 --> 05:25.384
Well, I don't know.

05:25.420 --> 05:27.388
There's only one toothbrush.

05:32.060 --> 05:35.427
This thing has been running
since we been here.

05:47.610 --> 05:49.703
GWEN: Tell her to
forget the green dress.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.808
The silver's
more flattering.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.774
And, God, I told her to
lay off the Mexican food.

05:53.820 --> 05:57.415
Jay's got it as crystal meth,
street grade.

05:57.450 --> 05:59.509
Can't tell much else till
they do the lab analysis.

05:59.560 --> 06:00.515
No prints on the bag.

06:00.560 --> 06:02.551
CRAIG: She also wants to
live tweet the mixer.

06:02.590 --> 06:04.683
She said she's the one
paying for it, so...

06:04.730 --> 06:05.924
No way.
Grab her phone.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.996
And remind her not to
talk about her dog

06:08.030 --> 06:09.622
like it's an
actual child.

06:09.670 --> 06:10.864
Thanks, Craig.

06:10.900 --> 06:12.959
Sorry to keep you
waiting, Detectives.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.831
This thing with Suzanne
is terrible,

06:14.870 --> 06:16.599
and we're
all in shock.

06:16.640 --> 06:18.107
What can I do for you?

06:18.140 --> 06:20.108
Just want to know
how Suzanne seemed.

06:20.140 --> 06:23.598
Actually, I know
what I can do for you:

06:23.650 --> 06:24.799
get you up on that board.

06:24.850 --> 06:27.876
I have a mixer in ten minutes
for the Duchess Elizaveta.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.842
Rich ladies
love cute cops.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.040
Especially ones with dimples.
What do you say?

06:32.090 --> 06:33.557
You should
totally do it. Yeah.

06:33.590 --> 06:34.909
He's still looking for
that special someone.

06:34.960 --> 06:35.949
I'm good, thanks.

06:35.990 --> 06:37.685
I'm happy with
what I have.

06:37.730 --> 06:38.685
Had.
Had.

06:38.730 --> 06:39.799
Ms. Stein,

06:39.830 --> 06:42.128
how_ was Suzanne
d0ing at work?

06:42.160 --> 06:44.663
Any problems with
other employees?

06:44.700 --> 06:45.496
Not a one.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.088
She was the best handler
that I had.

06:47.140 --> 06:48.038
Handler?

06:48.070 --> 06:49.628
Suzanne would meet with

06:49.670 --> 06:52.002
the clients one-on-one,
usually in their offices

06:52.040 --> 06:53.905
or their _homes
sometimes.

06:53.940 --> 06:55.931
She pre-screened them.
And then, ifI felt

06:55.980 --> 06:58.869
that a particular individual
was worth the effort...

06:58.910 --> 07:00.013
And could pay the price.

07:00.050 --> 07:02.018
...then we'd make
the magic happen.

07:02.050 --> 07:04.541
And how exactly do you do that?

07:04.590 --> 07:05.784
CARRIE:
Let me guess.

07:05.820 --> 07:07.515
Trade secret, right?

07:07.560 --> 07:08.959
Exactly. But believe me,

07:08.990 --> 07:10.548
it's harder
than you think.

07:10.590 --> 07:11.921
True love takes
a lot of hard work.

07:13.060 --> 07:14.721
CARRIE:
Not for you, apparently.

07:14.760 --> 07:17.888
Well, sometimes you get lucky.

07:17.930 --> 07:19.966
Jake and I
just connected.

07:21.600 --> 07:22.567
Jakey.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.908
All right? Thanks.
Yeah. Sure.

07:24.940 --> 07:26.168
Jake, this is Lieutenant Burns

07:26.210 --> 07:27.768
and Detective Wells.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.505
They're investigating
Suzanne's death.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.541
It's so terrible.

07:31.580 --> 07:33.047
Anything we can do to help.

07:33.080 --> 07:34.479
Thanks.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.182
The guys are about ready, babe.
Okay?

07:37.220 --> 07:38.517
GWEN: Unfortunately,
Jake and I are

07:38.550 --> 07:39.653
the exception to the rule.

07:39.690 --> 07:40.816
Most people-- they don't have

07:40.860 --> 07:42.009
the fairy tale.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.220
Which is where
I come in.

07:43.260 --> 07:45.581
Your clients must get
real demanding, huh?

07:45.630 --> 07:48.053
Yes. The uber-rich usually are.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.988
But Suzanne-- she really knew

07:50.030 --> 07:51.998
how to give them
what they wanted.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.133
Like drugs?

07:53.170 --> 07:54.137
Excuse me?

07:54.170 --> 07:57.207
We found a stash of meth
at Suzanne's apartment.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.936
Enough to suggest
she could have been selling it.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.174
I know nothing about that.

08:01.210 --> 08:03.576
So, if one of those
uber-rich clients needed

08:03.610 --> 08:06.249
a little pick-me-up
to help them at their mixer,

08:06.280 --> 08:07.918
Suzanne would have said no?

08:07.950 --> 08:09.941
Are we done here, Detectives?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.685
I got to get back to work.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.915
Sure. I just need to
see your client list.

08:13.960 --> 08:14.813
That's impossible.

08:14.860 --> 08:17.829
My clients require
complete discretion.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.623
Oh, come on. Play nice.

08:19.660 --> 08:21.025
Look at my dimples.

08:21.060 --> 08:22.994
You know we'll just get
a subpoena anyway.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.292
You sure about that?

08:24.330 --> 08:25.820
Judge Reinhart...

08:25.870 --> 08:28.168
Chief Judge Reinhart
and his wife Sarah--

08:28.200 --> 08:30.100
two of my most
satisfied clients.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.266
Have a good day.

08:33.710 --> 08:37.646
You know, I think
I got this.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.942
Guys, Gwen's on her way up,

08:38.980 --> 08:41.244
but feel free to grab a drink
and just chill.

08:41.280 --> 08:44.283
All you have to do is wait
for the woman of your dreams

08:44.320 --> 08:46.117
to walk right up
those steps, all right?

08:46.150 --> 08:48.015
Have fun, relax, take it easy.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.654
*

08:57.600 --> 08:59.124
Jeff!

08:59.170 --> 09:00.865
Jeff, hey.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.231
Excuse me.

09:02.270 --> 09:03.601
Yeah, hey.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.130
That vegan place over on Third?

09:05.170 --> 09:07.274
I love that place.
Yeah, yeah, me, too.

09:07.310 --> 09:10.006
I love their
cashew cheesecake.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.347
It's awesome.

09:11.380 --> 09:12.176
You know what?

09:12.210 --> 09:14.144
This place is so boring.
How about...

09:14.180 --> 09:16.171
How about you go over there,
get us a table.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.687
I know they don't take
reservations.

09:17.720 --> 09:19.756
I'll see you there.

09:19.790 --> 09:20.779
CARRIE:
See you there.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.253
What is she doing?

09:22.290 --> 09:23.951
What do you think?

09:32.870 --> 09:35.589
Oliver, tell me you remember me.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.801
Don't break my heart.

09:37.840 --> 09:39.671
Lanai? You're the one
who got me up on the board.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.735
Oh, wow.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.099
Ah, I can't believe
you're here.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.777
Seems like it was fate, right?

09:44.810 --> 09:46.869
You know what I'd like to do?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.138
I'd like to get out of here,
with you.

09:49.180 --> 09:50.738
Somewhere private, talk surfing.

09:50.790 --> 09:51.745
You live near here?

09:51.790 --> 09:53.087
I got a place in Tribeca.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.189
Ooh.

09:54.220 --> 09:56.256
I'll get us a car.

09:56.290 --> 09:57.655
Oh, oh.
M-Make her stop.

09:57.690 --> 09:59.021
No, no, no. I can't.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.789
She could do this all day.

10:00.830 --> 10:02.149
You really want
the Duchess to come out

10:02.200 --> 10:04.623
and find nothing
but a $500 cheese board?

10:04.670 --> 10:05.819
No.

10:05.870 --> 10:08.930
Charles, Charles, Charles!

10:08.970 --> 10:11.006
I loved your
TED talk on

10:11.040 --> 10:12.302
cognitive enhancement.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.934
I mean, ooh, ah. Sexy.

10:14.980 --> 10:16.208
Okay, fine.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.707
You can have
the client list,

10:17.750 --> 10:19.377
but only the clients
pertaining to Suzanne.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.913
That should work.
For now.

10:21.950 --> 10:24.248
...which is why, as a
bioethicist, I must speak out.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.157
Yes, you must, you must.
And...

10:28.190 --> 10:29.851
And I'm sure that

10:29.890 --> 10:31.289
the Duchess will
appreCIate that.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.649
Have a nice day.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.689
Hi!

10:34.700 --> 10:36.691
You were having a little
too much fun over there.

10:36.730 --> 10:37.822
Fun? No, no.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.031
I need a much more of
a challenge-- fish in a barrel.

10:40.070 --> 10:42.391
The kind of challenge I need is
a challenge with dimples.

10:42.440 --> 10:45.000
Hmm. Let's go.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.974
So on her credit
card application,

10:47.010 --> 10:49.740
Suzanne Mills puts down that
both her parents are deceased

10:49.780 --> 10:51.099
back in Illinois.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.175
But here's the thing: I can't
find any record of them.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.313
Well, death records can be
pretty spotty, right?

10:55.350 --> 10:56.942
Especially in
a smaller town.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.153
Yeah, but I can't find any
record of Suzanne Mills at all.

11:00.190 --> 11:02.954
Not in Joliet or anywhere
else for that matter.

11:02.990 --> 11:06.027
No high school graduation,
no DMV records, summer jobs.

11:06.060 --> 11:07.220
How about bank accounts?

11:07.260 --> 11:08.852
Mm, same thing. There's nothing.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.198
I'm telling you, Jay, it's like
this girl didn't exist

11:11.230 --> 11:13.994
before she moved to New York
18 months ago.

11:15.900 --> 11:19.233
Liver temp suggests time of
death about six hours ago,

11:19.270 --> 11:20.828
so that puts it
at 8:00 am.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.370
No sign of sexual assault.

11:22.410 --> 11:24.401
And what about
the toxicology report?

11:24.450 --> 11:25.849
Clean as a whistle.

11:25.880 --> 11:27.973
She may have been dealing meth,

11:28.020 --> 11:29.419
but she sure
wasn't usmg it.

11:29.450 --> 11:31.748
This is interesting,
which goes to cause of death.

11:31.790 --> 11:33.018
You said she was strangled.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.311
I did. She was.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.009
Twice.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.756
These are handprints.

11:38.790 --> 11:41.099
Looks like he tried to strangle
her with his bare hands,

11:41.130 --> 11:43.291
and then, for some reason,
couldn't finish the job.

11:43.330 --> 11:45.321
I found a second set of bruises.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.497
I think he stopped.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.132
She was unconscious...

11:49.170 --> 11:51.832
God, I hope she
was unconscious.

11:51.870 --> 11:53.906
He flipped her over,
he finished the job

11:53.940 --> 11:56.033
with some kind of ligature--
I don't know what kind--

11:56.080 --> 11:57.479
but that's what killed her.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.774
So he knew her.
And he didn't want to look

11:59.820 --> 12:01.378
at her face while
he was killing her.

12:01.420 --> 12:04.446
Yeah. I'm waiting for
subdermal photography,

12:04.490 --> 12:07.459
so hopefully we can I.D.

12:07.490 --> 12:09.924
some of these interior
bruises to find out

12:09.960 --> 12:11.325
what kind of
ligature he used.

12:11.360 --> 12:12.486
But you're right,

12:12.530 --> 12:14.327
it was an intimate killing.

12:14.360 --> 12:15.452
She knew her killer.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.024
Anything else?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.822
Uh, yeah.
She had some ink.

12:18.870 --> 12:22.067
Nothing really exciting, just,
you know, flowers and stuff.

12:22.100 --> 12:24.136
But then there's this.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.906
Tell her to forget
the green dress.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.474
The silver is much
more flattering.

12:32.510 --> 12:34.114
Thanks, Craig.

12:34.150 --> 12:38.211
One of Gwen's employees,
Craig Zadoc,

12:38.250 --> 12:39.854
had a very similar tattoo,

12:39.890 --> 12:43.018
only it was
79.0710 degrees west.

12:43.060 --> 12:45.221
Well, that can't be
a coincidence.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.818
What was that
number again?

12:46.860 --> 12:50.421
79.0710 degrees west,

12:50.470 --> 12:54.236
43.0800 degrees north.

12:54.270 --> 12:57.000
It's around
Niagara Falls.

12:57.040 --> 12:59.235
A bed and breakfast.

12:59.270 --> 13:00.407
Wow.

13:00.440 --> 13:03.500
Looks like Suzanne and Craig
were more than just coworkers.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.370
CRAIG:
We were engaged.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.968
The coordinates were
Suzanne's idea.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.578
Niagara Falls?

13:08.620 --> 13:10.212
We used to go hiking
on the weekends.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.478
We went up there a couple times.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.250
Wsumm

13:14.290 --> 13:16.315
It's where I proposed to her.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.487
How is it no one else knew
you guys were engaged?

13:18.530 --> 13:20.191
It's a secret.
Because of Gwen.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.824
Sh-She's got this thing that all
her handlers had to be single.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.360
She didn't want personal stuff
interfering with work.

13:24.400 --> 13:26.561
But Gwen wasn't single.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.192
Yeah, well, that was Gwen.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.333
She liked the rest
of us to be available.

13:30.370 --> 13:33.271
Suzanne and I were gonna wait
till we found new jobs.

13:33.310 --> 13:36.234
She said she had a plan,
she asked me to be patient.

13:36.280 --> 13:38.475
AL: It's a nice
story, Craig.

13:38.510 --> 13:41.070
Only problem is, when your
fiance turns up dead,

13:41.120 --> 13:43.042
why didn't you go straight
to the police?

13:43.090 --> 13:45.149
I-I panicked.

13:45.190 --> 13:46.441
Yeah, a killer panics, Craig.

13:46.490 --> 13:47.559
Why'd you panic?

13:47.590 --> 13:49.012
I told you, I loved her.

13:49.060 --> 13:50.288
I would never hurt her.

13:50.330 --> 13:53.197
But you do have a temper,
don't you?

13:53.230 --> 13:57.018
You took two prior assault
collars over the past ten years.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.163
Then there's the outstanding
arrest warrant pending

13:59.200 --> 14:00.394
from North Carolina.

14:01.470 --> 14:03.301
I've done some bad stuff.

14:03.340 --> 14:06.036
I used to drink back then,
I'd pick fights in bars,

14:06.070 --> 14:08.174
but I've done my time,
and I've stopped now.

14:08.210 --> 14:11.077
That arres_t warrant's for
a speeding Violation.

14:11.110 --> 14:13.340
I swear to God,
I would never hurt Suzanne.

14:13.380 --> 14:16.315
I didn't come to you because I
knew you'd find all this stuff.

14:16.350 --> 14:17.908
Where were you
yesterday morning?

14:17.950 --> 14:19.542
It was my day off.

14:19.590 --> 14:21.581
Um, I was supposed to meet
Suzanne for lunch.

14:21.620 --> 14:23.326
When I couldn't reach her,
I just...

14:23.360 --> 14:26.022
I hung out at the apartment.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.049
A guy came.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.249
There was an exterminator guy.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.029
Find him.
He'll tell you I was home.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.129
Don't worry, we will.

14:32.170 --> 14:34.889
You know anybody who was staying
with Suzanne

14:34.940 --> 14:37.067
No, I never saw anybody.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.601
We also found some crystal
meth in Suzanne's apartment.

14:39.640 --> 14:42.677
No, no way.
S-Suzanne didn't do drugs.

14:42.710 --> 14:44.246
Trust me, I know.
I mean...

14:44.280 --> 14:46.077
Like I said, I've made mistakes.

14:46.110 --> 14:48.647
Craig, do you know anybody
who would want to hurt her?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.489
No. Why would anybody
want to hurt her?

14:50.520 --> 14:53.057
Someone from work.
A client she talked about.

14:53.090 --> 14:54.955
No. I... I mean,
she met so many guys,

14:54.990 --> 14:56.548
sometimes she would have to
reject the weirder ones.

14:56.590 --> 14:58.080
That would
piss them off.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.995
Someone in particular
she talked about?

15:00.030 --> 15:02.089
No, but, I mean...

15:02.130 --> 15:05.099
Gwen deals with some
really high-end clientele.

15:05.130 --> 15:08.395
I can't believe one of them
could do something like this.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.305
So, it's a no-go
on the fianc, huh?

15:10.340 --> 15:12.638
He's sticking in town,
but I don't think he did it.

15:12.670 --> 15:15.309
Exterminator puts him at his
place pretty much when he says.

15:15.340 --> 15:16.978
It'd be tough
to make it over

15:17.010 --> 15:19.103
to Bushwick Park
at the time of death.

15:19.150 --> 15:20.947
Any more info on
Suzanne's life?

15:20.980 --> 15:23.517
We tried to contact her
superwsor from her last job

15:23.550 --> 15:25.245
_ as_ a_waitress
in Virginia Beach.

15:25.290 --> 15:26.712
But the restaurant
never eXIsted.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.251
What about her
phone records?

15:28.290 --> 15:30.429
Uh, we think the phone
was taken from the scene

15:30.460 --> 15:32.382
and turned off soon
after the murder.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.318
And maybe because of this.

15:34.360 --> 15:38.091
AL: That's a lot of calls
from that one number.

15:38.130 --> 15:39.222
18 to be exact.

15:39.270 --> 15:41.636
Number belongs to this guy,

15:41.670 --> 15:44.309
Lee Ross, software developer.

15:44.340 --> 15:46.262
Guy's, like,
a paper billionaire.

15:46.310 --> 15:48.130
He's got contracts
with over half

15:48.180 --> 15:51.172
of Silicon Valley to create apps
for his own Ross Glass.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.110
Craig mentioned that
some of the clients

15:53.150 --> 15:55.038
would get pretty
pissed off if Suzanne had

15:55.080 --> 15:56.479
to tell them they
didn't qualify.

15:56.520 --> 15:59.216
Exactly. Which is why
I cross-referenced Ross

15:59.250 --> 16:01.081
with Gwen's client list.
Turns out,

16:01.120 --> 16:02.417
Platinum Select worked
with them three months

16:02.460 --> 16:04.724
before they dropped him.
Don't know why.

16:04.760 --> 16:06.421
Let's find out.

16:10.670 --> 16:14.436
Look, it sucks Suzanne's dead,
but I had nothing to do with it.

16:14.470 --> 16:16.529
I barely knew her.

16:16.570 --> 16:17.707
AL:
How many times you meet?

16:17.740 --> 16:19.503
Oh, three or four.

16:19.540 --> 16:21.337
I did what she said--
got some new clothes,

16:21.380 --> 16:23.041
smoothed out the rough edges,

16:23.080 --> 16:25.173
and I think I'm ready to go;
I'm ready for

16:25.210 --> 16:27.178
my 30 hand-picked hotties.

16:27.220 --> 16:28.414
Butthen,
a week before

16:28.450 --> 16:30.441
my par-tay, Suzanne calls me

16:30.490 --> 16:33.288
and tells me _
I am not approved as a client.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.049
She say why
you weren't approved?

16:35.090 --> 16:37.285
Guess the fact
that I've been divorced.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.422
Three times.

16:38.460 --> 16:40.496
She said it wasn't good

16:40.530 --> 16:42.088
for Gwen's brand.

16:42.130 --> 16:43.392
Still, my money's good,
so I called her,

16:43.430 --> 16:44.727
see if they'd reconsider.

16:44.770 --> 16:47.136
You called her 18 times, Lee.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.239
Maybe after three or four,

16:48.270 --> 16:50.067
you figure they're not
reconsidering.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.634
What?

16:51.670 --> 16:54.104
No. I didn't do that.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.404
I called her once
and left a message.

16:59.110 --> 17:01.317
On a jog.
In Bushwick Park?

17:01.350 --> 17:03.489
No, the Reservoir
in Central Park.

17:03.520 --> 17:05.181
Can anybody confirm that?

17:06.350 --> 17:08.511
I was wearing my Glass.

17:08.560 --> 17:10.118
Recorded everything.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.128
Joe _can download
it for you.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.629
AL: You ever hang that
Miles Davis print I got you?

17:19.670 --> 17:22.264
CARRIE:
It's in a safe place.

17:22.300 --> 17:23.836
Hey, Joe.

17:23.870 --> 17:25.508
Hey.

17:25.540 --> 17:28.270
These photos on your computer
of Suzanne--

17:28.310 --> 17:30.278
you take them?

17:30.310 --> 17:32.198
Sit down!

17:32.250 --> 17:34.411
You just became
our number one suspect.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.181
Look, I didn't do anything,
okay?

17:43.230 --> 17:44.481
Then why'd you try to run?

17:44.530 --> 17:47.249
I don't know. I freaked out.

17:49.500 --> 17:53.231
Yeah, Suzanne came by
to meet with Mr. Ross, and

17:53.270 --> 17:54.464
we talked a little.

17:54.500 --> 17:55.762
I thought she was cute,

17:55.800 --> 17:58.166
so I asked her out,
but she said no.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.179
Then you called her 17 times
to get her to change her mind,

18:01.210 --> 18:03.201
and when that didn't work,
you killed her.

18:03.250 --> 18:05.138
What? No, I'm telling you,

18:05.180 --> 18:05.976
I just found out...

18:06.010 --> 18:08.217
Joe, look at things
my way, okay?

18:08.250 --> 18:09.512
On the one hand,
I got a dead girl.

18:09.550 --> 18:11.211
On the other hand, I got a guy

18:11.250 --> 18:13.514
who asked her out, and
when she said no, stalked her,

18:13.560 --> 18:15.812
called her 17 times,
took hundreds

18:15.860 --> 18:17.418
of photos of her
without her knowing.

18:17.460 --> 18:18.882
You see how this looks to me?!

18:18.930 --> 18:21.125
I didn't kill her.

18:21.160 --> 18:22.650
You got to believe me.

18:22.700 --> 18:25.260
Yeah, I did all those
other things.

18:25.300 --> 18:27.461
I know I got a problem
that way, but...

18:27.500 --> 18:30.503
I thought maybe I could kind of
make it work out.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.167
You thought wrong, Joe.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.609
Where were you
yesterday morning?

18:35.640 --> 18:38.143
I was doing errands
for Mr. Ross.

18:38.180 --> 18:39.442
He told us
he sent you on errands.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.141
You got any proof
you actually did them?

18:41.180 --> 18:43.580
Yeah. People saw me.
I can tell you where I was.

18:43.620 --> 18:45.508
I can tell you.
Start writing, Joe.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.321
Stupid thing is,

18:52.360 --> 18:54.726
all the stuff I was doing--

18:54.760 --> 18:57.160
it wasn't gonna make
any difference.

18:57.200 --> 18:59.361
Yeah, my experience--
and this is just me--

18:59.400 --> 19:01.834
the stalking thing:
not a turn-on.

19:01.870 --> 19:03.531
Okay, yeah, I get it.

19:03.570 --> 19:06.630
But that's not what I meant.

19:06.670 --> 19:09.901
Suzanne-- she wasn't into guys.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.476
How do you know?

19:11.510 --> 19:13.319
Just look at my pictures.

19:13.350 --> 19:14.840
She was with this chick.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.438
I got her going
into Suzanne's house.

19:16.480 --> 19:17.913
She's got a key.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.941
They wear the same clothes.

19:19.990 --> 19:22.208
They were holding hands
in one of them.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.818
So,

19:23.860 --> 19:25.225
see?

19:25.260 --> 19:26.955
It wasn't about me.

19:26.990 --> 19:29.390
Keep writing.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.392
JAY:
Okay, Suzanne's mystery woman.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.862
First-off, no one recognizes her

19:34.900 --> 19:37.300
at the building;
it the same at Gwen's.

19:37.340 --> 19:38.967
I talked to the
fianc Craig.

19:39.010 --> 19:41.205
He says he doesn't know her,
and he's not buying

19:41.240 --> 19:42.434
that Suzanne was dating her.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.869
Wouldn't be the first time a
fianc's been surprised, right?

19:44.910 --> 19:46.468
I have a feeling our Suzanne

19:46.510 --> 19:47.909
has a lot of surprises.

19:47.950 --> 19:50.510
This is what I wanted
to show you guys.

19:50.550 --> 19:51.642
Yeah, that's Suzanne's building.
Right.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.352
Now, our mystery woman headed
into Suzanne's building

19:54.390 --> 19:55.789
at 3:05 p.m.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.253
I didn't see any car

19:57.290 --> 19:58.359
in the surveillance photos,
so I figured...

19:58.390 --> 19:59.425
The subway.
Right.

19:59.460 --> 20:00.927
If she took the subway, odds are

20:00.960 --> 20:03.497
she took the M train
to the Marcy Avenue stop,

20:03.530 --> 20:04.997
'cause it's only a couple blocks
away from Suzanne's apartment.

20:05.030 --> 20:06.918
Okay.

20:06.970 --> 20:08.790
And I'm really proud
of myself for this one.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.569
I tracked all the way
along the M train,

20:10.610 --> 20:11.838
and using
facial recognition,

20:11.870 --> 20:14.407
cross-checked it
with the subway security footage

20:14.440 --> 20:16.704
with all the photos
we had of our mystery lady.

20:16.740 --> 20:19.243
And guess who's coming out
of the Seneca Ave stop.

20:20.550 --> 20:21.915
Our mystery lady.

20:21.950 --> 20:23.315
That's right. How
awesome is the Jay Man?

20:27.520 --> 20:29.818
I'm thinking maybe she was
an outdoors kind of girl.

20:29.860 --> 20:33.250
There's all these topo maps.
Maybe she liked to hike.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.598
Wait a second.

20:35.630 --> 20:36.927
That little happy pig.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.394
Suzanne had a magnet with

20:39.430 --> 20:41.432
the exact same logo
on her fridge.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.606
"Smiling Pig Donuts."

20:51.580 --> 20:54.413
Yeah, I've seen them
both come in here.

20:54.450 --> 20:56.543
AL:
Have any names?
Nah.

20:56.580 --> 20:58.514
Just know that they come in
together about once a week.

20:58.550 --> 21:01.018
That one liked Bavarian
Cream, and the other--

21:01.060 --> 21:03.324
she always got a
chocolate glazed.

21:03.360 --> 21:04.725
Person finds a donut
that they like,

21:04.760 --> 21:07.320
they stick to it. One
guy used to come in...

21:07.360 --> 21:08.588
Okay, thank you,
uh, Desiree.

21:08.630 --> 21:10.052
Did you happen to hear

21:10.100 --> 21:11.988
where they were going
or where they come from?

21:12.030 --> 21:13.566
Sorry.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.694
Mostly, I just focus
on the donuts.

21:16.740 --> 21:19.038
You look like a maple frosted.

21:19.070 --> 21:20.401
If you think of
anything else,

21:20.440 --> 21:21.839
could you give us
a call, please?

21:21.880 --> 21:24.804
Thanks. Come on,
Maple Frosted Guy.

21:27.350 --> 21:28.874
Hey.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.445
Group like that--
smoking cigarettes,

21:31.490 --> 21:33.458
drinking coffee,
eating donuts--

21:33.490 --> 21:35.583
generally means
a 12

21:35.620 --> 21:38.384
Suzanne did have a bag of
meth in her apartment.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.421
Maybe they were
in recovery together.

21:43.100 --> 21:45.591
I'm sorry, but this is where
the anonymous part

21:45.630 --> 21:47.336
really gets in the way,
Detectives.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.429
We understand your resistance,
but please.

21:49.470 --> 21:50.732
This woman was killed
yesterday.

21:50.770 --> 21:53.603
We need all the help we can get
to solve her murder.

21:53.640 --> 21:57.508
Please, if there's anything at
all you think you can tell us.

22:03.450 --> 22:04.986
That's Maria and
that's Claire.

22:05.020 --> 22:06.442
AL:
Claire?

22:06.490 --> 22:08.117
You're sure?
Yes.

22:08.160 --> 22:10.754
I don't have their last names,
of course.

22:10.790 --> 22:12.382
Maria's struggling
with a meth addiction,

22:12.430 --> 22:14.625
been in and out of the program
for years.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.628
Claire joined us
about six months ago.

22:16.660 --> 22:18.821
She'd had a cocaine problem.
She's been clean for two years.

22:18.870 --> 22:20.929
So they didn't
join the program together?

22:20.970 --> 22:22.494
No. No, they met here.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.768
And from what
I could tell,

22:23.810 --> 22:25.038
they became really close.

22:25.070 --> 22:27.504
Claire was like an older sister,
trying to look out for Maria.

22:27.540 --> 22:29.679
They wanted to help each other

22:29.710 --> 22:32.474
improve their lives.
Was it working?

22:32.510 --> 22:34.842
Recovery was a real struggle
for Maria.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.542
She was clean
as of last week, but...

22:37.590 --> 22:39.080
she told me she'd
scored some meth,

22:39.120 --> 22:40.678
but that sh-she'd
hidden it somewhere

22:40.720 --> 22:42.381
so she wouldn't use it.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.456
But I could see
she was thinking about it.

22:44.490 --> 22:46.458
Was Claire struggling, too?

22:46.490 --> 22:47.627
No, Claire was doing great.

22:47.660 --> 22:49.389
She just got her two-year chip.

22:49.430 --> 22:52.126
Maria brought boxes of
donuts to celebrate.

22:52.170 --> 22:54.934
A lot of boxes.

22:54.970 --> 22:57.564
I am so sorry
to hear about Claire.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.407
I thought...

22:59.440 --> 23:02.978
she'd be the one who'd make it
out of here alive.

23:03.010 --> 23:05.649
Thank you.

23:05.680 --> 23:06.840
Claire?

23:06.880 --> 23:08.472
AL: Yeah.
I don't know, Al.

23:08.520 --> 23:09.942
Why do you think
that's her real name?

23:09.980 --> 23:12.619
Because 12-step meetings
are all about honesty.

23:12.650 --> 23:15.016
And from what I can tell, Claire
took them pretty seriously.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.984
Okay, well, if "Suzanne"
is an alias for Claire,

23:18.030 --> 23:19.827
that would explain
why we can't find

23:19.860 --> 23:21.851
any history on her.
Right. So do the search again,

23:21.900 --> 23:23.458
this time using "Claire."

23:23.500 --> 23:24.899
You got it, boss.
Thank you.

23:24.930 --> 23:26.795
Donuts

23:26.830 --> 23:27.967
Well, we're cops.

23:28.000 --> 23:29.888
What'd you get me?
A maple frosted.

23:29.940 --> 23:31.134
Mm-mm.

23:31.170 --> 23:32.967
Oh, and Maria's
last name and address.

23:33.010 --> 23:35.535
No way. Come on.
Mm-hmm. It's Maria Torres.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.548
She's over on DeKalb
in Bed-Stuy.

23:37.580 --> 23:40.549
See, I figured if Maria bought
boxes of donuts last week

23:40.580 --> 23:43.071
for Claire's anniversary, she
probably used a credit card.

23:43.120 --> 23:44.815
And I was right.
Nice work.

23:44.850 --> 23:47.114
Mm-hmm. Hey.
And nice donuts.

23:55.160 --> 23:57.424
Maria Torres?

24:12.050 --> 24:14.075
All clear.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.509
Al.

24:24.590 --> 24:25.181
JAY:
Okay, Al. Here it is.

24:25.230 --> 24:26.652
Facial recognition matched

24:26.690 --> 24:28.555
with a photo taken
at the Mexican border.

24:28.600 --> 24:30.659
_ Suzanne Mills
is really Claire Johnson--

24:30.700 --> 24:32.258
26, born in
Torrance, California.

24:32.300 --> 24:34.097
And doesn't look
like a fun childhood.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.732
Dad passed away
when she was eight.

24:35.770 --> 24:37.067
Her mom was in and out
for petty larceny.

24:37.100 --> 24:39.705
I've also got
three social service complaints

24:39.740 --> 24:42.732
alleging physical and mental
abuse against her stepdad.

24:42.780 --> 24:45.146
At 16, she left home and
started getting into trouble.

24:45.180 --> 24:46.977
She was arrested in 2004

24:47.010 --> 24:49.217
for stealing a sandwich
and some gum in Hermosa Beach.

24:49.250 --> 24:51.013
But then we got her
for criminal possession

24:51.050 --> 24:53.814
of a controlled substance,
twice, in 2008.

24:53.860 --> 24:56.215
Now, ATM receipts show that
she spent some time in Texas,

24:56.260 --> 24:58.524
Northern Mexico and Baja.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.721
Then all of a sudden,
two years ago, just like that,

25:00.760 --> 25:02.022
bang, she disappears.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.220
And when does Suzanne show up?

25:03.260 --> 25:05.160
Uh, the earliest

25:05.200 --> 25:09.136
we pick up any activity
on Suzanne is when

25:09.170 --> 25:12.003
she signed the lease for her
apartment a year and a half ago.

25:12.040 --> 25:14.201
It's expensive to create
a whole new identity.

25:14.240 --> 25:15.878
I doubt she did it alone.

25:15.910 --> 25:17.207
Let's see
who was helping her.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.707
JAY:
You got it, boss.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.001
Murray, anything new on Maria?

25:20.050 --> 25:22.211
Yeah, she was born
in Akron, Ohio.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.945
Uh, went to NYU, took a few

25:23.990 --> 25:25.287
drug collars and dropped out.

25:25.320 --> 25:27.015
The last thing I have is

25:27.050 --> 25:29.154
her working at a shoe store
in Queens.

25:29.190 --> 25:30.623
They said she quit
four months ago.

25:30.660 --> 25:31.854
I got a BOLO out.

25:31.890 --> 25:33.255
We're looking everywhere.
Okay, thanks.

25:33.290 --> 25:34.894
Whoever broke in
here was looking

25:34.930 --> 25:36.625
for something specific.

25:36.660 --> 25:37.729
Look at these
power cords.

25:37.770 --> 25:40.227
All the electronics--
phones, computers, tablets--

25:40.270 --> 25:42.033
they're gone.

25:44.370 --> 25:46.201
LEE:
It sucks Suzanne is dead.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.776
AL: How many
times you meet?

25:47.810 --> 25:49.209
Three, four?

25:55.820 --> 25:58.186
That software guy, Lee Ross--

25:58.220 --> 26:00.916
at his office, he had this
art piece behind his desk.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.814
Coffee mugs,
except one was missing.

26:02.860 --> 26:04.828
The orange one.

26:04.860 --> 26:07.055
It's right here.

26:09.830 --> 26:11.127
Stuart, I'm not looking
at anything right now.

26:11.170 --> 26:12.728
I'm looking at a blank...

26:12.770 --> 26:14.988
I'll call you back.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.860
Been looking for this, Lee?

26:16.900 --> 26:18.709
Where'd you find it?

26:18.740 --> 26:20.674
We'll tell you if you tell us
what it really is.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.577
It's a travel mug.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.204
Try again, Lee.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.571
And a camouflaged Bluetooth
data migration device.

26:29.780 --> 26:33.682
It copies electronic files
and hard drives fast.

26:33.720 --> 26:35.085
Very fast.

26:35.120 --> 26:36.985
Without anybody knowing it.

26:37.020 --> 26:38.351
Well, that doesn't sound
entirely legal.

26:38.390 --> 26:40.278
Well, my investors
don't seem to care.

26:40.330 --> 26:41.922
Who are your investors?

26:41.960 --> 26:45.669
Oh, uh, Department of Defense,
Military Intelligence...

26:45.700 --> 26:47.361
Okay, but when Suzanne came here
to prep you,

26:47.400 --> 26:49.664
you told her what this mug
really was, didn't you?

26:49.700 --> 26:51.167
Maybe.
Sure, you did.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.859
You were trying
to impress her and Gwen.

26:52.910 --> 26:56.038
Are you telling me
Suzanne stole it?

26:56.080 --> 26:56.978
We're not telling
you anything,

26:57.010 --> 26:58.409
except you're not
getting this back today.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.405
Look,

26:59.450 --> 27:01.418
the prototype cost me 200 grand.

27:01.450 --> 27:04.681
Homeland is expecting
them to go live in 2017.

27:04.720 --> 27:06.881
Please be careful with it.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.286
Don't worry. We will.

27:09.320 --> 27:12.255
JAY: So, welcome to the nerd
porn portion of our program.

27:12.290 --> 27:14.724
This is the most incredible

27:14.760 --> 27:17.695
integrated data migration system
I have ever seen.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.266
Al, I want this.

27:19.300 --> 27:21.291
I need this.
Maybe for Christmas.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.262
_ What's on it?_
Gigs of information
on Gwen's clients.

27:23.300 --> 27:24.699
Credit card numbers,

27:24.740 --> 27:27.208
driver's licenses,
Social Security numbers.

27:27.240 --> 27:28.878
So Claire, as Suzanne,

27:28.910 --> 27:31.845
used this mug to steal
financial information. But why?

27:31.880 --> 27:34.713
Because she was working
for the Sinaloa Cartel.

27:34.750 --> 27:36.445
How'd you get that?
Claire was sending packets

27:36.480 --> 27:38.914
of data from this device
to an office park

27:38.950 --> 27:42.852
in Tijuana that's a known front
for the Sinaloa Cartel.

27:42.890 --> 27:43.982
It was an easy
call to make.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.782
But what does a drug cartel need

27:45.830 --> 27:47.889
with all that I.D. information?

27:47.930 --> 27:49.727
They use the financial holdings
of other people

27:49.760 --> 27:51.193
as a way to launder
their drug money.

27:51.230 --> 27:53.460
With complex
financial profiles,

27:53.500 --> 27:55.730
it's really not that hard
to hide large sums of money

27:55.770 --> 27:56.998
within different holdings,

27:57.040 --> 27:59.065
even deposit
or withdraw at will

27:59.110 --> 28:00.304
without being detected.

28:00.340 --> 28:02.433
Gwen's clients were
the perfect dupes.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.902
But how does
Claire Johnson

28:03.950 --> 28:07.442
get hooked up
with a Mexican drug cartel?

28:07.480 --> 28:09.243
Thought you'd never ask.

28:10.950 --> 28:15.284
Claire was dating this guy
in Mexico named Dean Morrison.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.459
Now, Morrison
turns out to be

28:17.490 --> 28:18.718
not such a good guy;
in fact,

28:18.760 --> 28:21.092
the reason why they're in the
papers is because he was found

28:21.130 --> 28:23.223
with his head cut off
two years ago

28:23.260 --> 28:24.818
in a Michoacn
parking structure,

28:24.870 --> 28:27.020
apparently the victim
of the Sinaloa Cartel.

28:27.070 --> 28:28.799
He had been
working for them,

28:28.840 --> 28:31.263
doing the same thing as Claire,
stealing financial information.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.800
Problem is is
he got greedy.

28:32.840 --> 28:34.398
He thought he could sell
the cartel's info

28:34.440 --> 28:35.805
to somebody else.

28:35.840 --> 28:37.478
They found out about it
and whacked him.

28:37.510 --> 28:39.944
Six months later,
Claire vanishes,

28:39.980 --> 28:42.813
and Suzanne Mills shows up
in New York.

28:42.850 --> 28:45.785
The cartel let her live if she'd
continue to steal for them.

28:45.820 --> 28:47.959
And they knew Gwen's client base
was a treasure trove

28:47.990 --> 28:49.355
of hiding places
for their money.

28:49.390 --> 28:51.950
So what do you think went wrong?

28:51.990 --> 28:54.891
They caught wind that maybe
she wanted to drop out, run away

28:54.930 --> 28:56.329
with this Craig guy?

28:56.360 --> 28:58.169
But the way she was killed,

28:58.200 --> 29:00.168
that was no cartel-style
execution.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.235
But it was
definitely them

29:01.270 --> 29:02.339
at Maria's.

29:02.370 --> 29:04.099
We still have one missing piece.

29:04.140 --> 29:05.869
It's the one
we've had all along.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.229
Who killed Claire?

29:09.080 --> 29:11.275
AL:
You got to wonder about things

29:11.310 --> 29:14.177
when a young girl like Claire
finds herself forced

29:14.220 --> 29:17.075
to work for the Sinaloa Cartel.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.111
How does that happen?
I don't know.

29:19.150 --> 29:21.118
Claire seems like
the perfect candidate to me.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.957
She was alone, lost,

29:22.990 --> 29:24.252
confused about
who she was.

29:24.290 --> 29:26.485
I get it.

29:26.530 --> 29:28.851
Not that this is gonna surprise
you, but there was a time

29:28.900 --> 29:33.269
in my life where I could've
gone down a very... bad path.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.860
Wrong guy who seemed
like the right guy.

29:35.900 --> 29:39.438
You know, he was so bad,
which made him so good.

29:39.470 --> 29:43.008
And, uh, he almost got
me into some pretty...

29:43.040 --> 29:45.247
serious trouble.

29:45.280 --> 29:48.374
Well, you two weren't
robbing banks together, right?

29:48.420 --> 29:50.911
Well, um...

29:50.950 --> 29:52.508
WEBSTER:
Hi. I have the, uh,

29:52.550 --> 29:53.949
subdermal photograph results

29:53.990 --> 29:55.252
from Claire--

29:55.290 --> 29:57.554
aka Suzanne's-- neck.

29:57.590 --> 29:59.148
Great.

29:59.190 --> 30:01.897
I'm not really sure
what I'm looking at,

30:01.930 --> 30:03.557
except a definitive
bruising pattern.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.568
GWEN:
True love takes

30:05.600 --> 30:08.467
a lot of hard work.

30:11.040 --> 30:12.405
Sometimes you get lucky.

30:12.440 --> 30:14.829
Jakey.

30:14.880 --> 30:18.441
This is Lieutenant Burns
and Detective Wells.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.368
They're investigating
Suzanne's death.

30:20.410 --> 30:22.071
It's so terrible.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.576
Anything we can
do to help.

30:28.020 --> 30:29.578
Could it be from a belt buckle?

30:29.620 --> 30:32.157
Yeah, could be.

30:32.190 --> 30:34.522
Gwen_'s fianc Jake
was wearing a belt buckle

30:34.560 --> 30:36.994
that almost exactly matches
that bruising pattern.

30:37.030 --> 30:38.998
Let's go.

30:44.910 --> 30:46.468
What do you want?

30:46.510 --> 30:48.478
Jake here?
We have a warrant.

30:48.510 --> 30:51.149
Which is a really good thing,
because I am all flirted out.

30:52.180 --> 30:54.171
He's in the kitchen.

30:57.250 --> 30:59.138
Jake.

31:00.550 --> 31:02.381
How can I help you, Detectives?

31:02.420 --> 31:03.978
AL:
You know what?

31:04.030 --> 31:05.622
This'll be easier
back at the station.

31:05.660 --> 31:07.628
I know how busy
Ms. Stein is.

31:07.660 --> 31:09.059
We don't want
to bother her.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.965
If he goes, I go.

31:11.000 --> 31:13.218
You heard the lady.
She's the boss.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.238
It's about Claire.

31:18.270 --> 31:19.532
Claire Johnson.

31:19.570 --> 31:21.333
Never heard of her.

31:21.380 --> 31:22.631
VVho?

31:22.680 --> 31:24.477
You knew her as
Suzanne Mills.

31:24.510 --> 31:27.377
But Jake here--

31:27.410 --> 31:29.640
which I'm assuming is
so not your real name--

31:29.680 --> 31:32.114
Jake knew her
as Claire Johnson.

31:32.150 --> 31:34.118
Jake? I don't understand.

31:34.160 --> 31:35.684
What are they talking about?

31:35.720 --> 31:37.984
No!
All right!

31:38.030 --> 31:39.657
Back off! All right?
I'm gonna kill her!

31:39.690 --> 31:41.590
Jake, it's over.

31:41.630 --> 31:43.450
No...

32:05.090 --> 32:06.045
"Soy uno de ustedes."

32:06.090 --> 32:07.239
"I am one of you."

32:07.290 --> 32:08.518
That's what you said.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.482
"Somos hermanos."

32:10.520 --> 32:12.624
"We are brothers."

32:12.660 --> 32:15.493
You called the cartel, didn't
you? That's why they were there.

32:15.530 --> 32:17.293
You thought they were
gonna help you out.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.661
Jake.

32:21.700 --> 32:24.134
Or, uh, Jack...

32:24.170 --> 32:28.231
Burton from San Diego.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.647
You really think the Sinaloa
Cartel gives a damn about you?

32:31.680 --> 32:33.602
They take care of their friends.

32:33.650 --> 32:36.210
But you're not their friend.
Not anymore.

32:36.250 --> 32:38.241
When you killed Claire,

32:38.290 --> 32:41.282
you blew their multimillion-
dollar I.D. scam wide open.

32:41.320 --> 32:44.528
You really thought those guys
were gonna be happy to see you?

32:45.560 --> 32:48.529
Yeah. All right.

32:49.560 --> 32:51.528
This is what I'm gonna do.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.526
I'm gonna send you
to Rikers.

32:53.570 --> 32:55.231
We'll see what kind
of protection you get

32:55.270 --> 32:56.362
from tus hermanos.

32:57.400 --> 33:00.233
Good luck there...
right?

33:00.270 --> 33:02.135
Okay.

33:03.140 --> 33:04.641
Okay.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.545
But I want protective custody.

33:06.580 --> 33:08.343
The best,
you understand?

33:08.380 --> 33:11.588
You'll take what we give you.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.048
When'd you start
working for the cartel?

33:16.090 --> 33:18.251
Uh, when I was 18.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.383
You know, a friend from
high school hooked me up.

33:20.430 --> 33:23.456
I been doing...
I.D. stuff every since.

33:24.630 --> 33:26.427
Claire was new.

33:26.470 --> 33:28.665
She got into some trouble
down in Mexico,

33:28.700 --> 33:30.531
and they got her working.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.208
She didn't want to,

33:32.240 --> 33:34.128
but we don't always
get to choose, do we?

33:34.180 --> 33:36.375
So they placed you
at Gwen's together?

33:36.410 --> 33:39.675
Well, Gwen had a ton
of files on rich guys--

33:39.710 --> 33:41.746
hard copies only--
that she kept in a safe.

33:41.780 --> 33:44.681
I handed those off.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.439
Claire was in charge
of the digital stuff.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.082
We both did a good job.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.680
Yeah.

33:51.730 --> 33:55.496
And then...
things got personal.

33:55.530 --> 33:57.498
Whatever.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.327
Tell me.

34:01.270 --> 34:03.363
Well, there was something
about her, you know?

34:03.400 --> 34:06.107
She was just this girl,

34:06.140 --> 34:08.700
this sweet girl, and she was
the only one in the city

34:08.740 --> 34:11.709
who actually knew
who I was, you know?

34:11.750 --> 34:13.775
I loved her.

34:16.350 --> 34:18.386
But she was in love
With someone else.

34:18.420 --> 34:21.082
Craig Zadoc.

34:22.490 --> 34:24.321
She told you about him.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.123
Yeah.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.286
VVhen?

34:27.330 --> 34:29.423
Jack".

34:29.460 --> 34:31.462
you don't start talking,

34:31.500 --> 34:34.469
your protective custody is gonna
be cleaning out the bathrooms

34:34.500 --> 34:36.468
at La Mesa Prison in Tijuana.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.333
Claire thought she was just
gonna run off with this guy?

34:39.370 --> 34:41.133
Huh

34:41.180 --> 34:43.171
She was gonna run
from the cartel.

34:43.210 --> 34:44.746
Run from me.

34:44.780 --> 34:47.442
She said she'd finally found
something real with him.

34:48.850 --> 34:50.249
With him.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.352
And she just stared at me
like she was surprised.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.168
And I couldn't let go.

35:04.200 --> 35:06.225
But I couldn't look at her,

35:06.270 --> 35:10.092
so I turned her around
and I finished it.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.802
She never should have
made me love her.

35:16.310 --> 35:17.902
Definitely cartel guys.

35:17.940 --> 35:20.477
This is from a traffic cam
outside of Gwen's apartment.

35:20.510 --> 35:24.219
And this is from yesterday--
cab at JFK.

35:24.250 --> 35:25.842
These guys flew in from
Tijuana to New York,

35:25.890 --> 35:27.482
tossed up Maria's apartment,
shot up Gwen's.

35:27.520 --> 35:30.318
From what I can tell,
they could still be in the city.

35:30.360 --> 35:31.486
They're looking
for Maria.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.929
How would they know about Maria?

35:32.960 --> 35:34.825
Jake told them.

35:34.860 --> 35:37.499
He said he called the cartel,
told them Claire had an accident

35:37.530 --> 35:39.566
and that he needed
to be extricated.

35:39.600 --> 35:41.488
But first they
wanted something.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.337
Claire had told them
she stole a device

35:43.370 --> 35:44.837
from one of Gwen's clients.

35:44.870 --> 35:45.837
Lee Ross.
Right.

35:45.870 --> 35:48.703
So they wanted it
and the information on it.

35:48.740 --> 35:50.799
Jake tried to be cooperative
and find the device.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.876
He couldn't find it
at Claire's, he told them

35:52.910 --> 35:54.878
maybe it was at her
good friend Maria's place.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.218
But they never found it
at Maria's because they weren't

35:57.250 --> 35:59.946
looking for anything
as simple as a coffee mug.

35:59.990 --> 36:02.208
Which means they think
Maria still has it,

36:02.260 --> 36:03.010
and they're gonna kill her.

36:03.060 --> 36:04.550
We got to find her
before they do.

36:04.590 --> 36:06.524
JAY: How the hell do you
outrun a cartel,

36:06.560 --> 36:08.357
especially without a plan?

36:08.400 --> 36:10.220
Claire had the plan.

36:10.260 --> 36:11.693
And Maria was Claire's

36:11.730 --> 36:13.618
only confidant, which means

36:13.670 --> 36:15.934
Maria is following
Claire's escape plan.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.931
So I'm thinking she
was maybe outdoorsy.

36:19.970 --> 36:22.336
There's all
these topo maps.

36:24.510 --> 36:26.899
Claire had a map
at her apartment.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.212
The Catskills.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.148
Ellenville.

36:29.180 --> 36:31.387
Jay, search under the names
Claire Johnson,

36:31.420 --> 36:33.342
Suzanne Mills or Maria Torres

36:33.390 --> 36:35.358
for a_house
or cabin rental

36:35.390 --> 36:36.709
or purchase within a mile

36:36.760 --> 36:37.818
of Ellenville.

36:39.430 --> 36:40.749
JAY:
Nothing.

36:40.790 --> 36:42.929
I just talked to
Claire's fianc Craig.

36:42.960 --> 36:44.723
He doesn't know much.

36:44.770 --> 36:45.998
He says the two of them
generally talked about

36:46.030 --> 36:48.260
getting away from the city,
romantic stuff.

36:48.300 --> 36:50.666
Finding a farm somewhere,
living off the grid.

36:50.700 --> 36:52.338
Look under Craig Zadoc.

36:55.710 --> 36:56.836
JAY: N0.
AL: Wait.

36:56.880 --> 36:58.438
She was
thinking ahead.

36:58.480 --> 37:01.313
Try Claire Zadoc.

37:02.750 --> 37:04.911
JAY: Got it.
Down payment was made

37:04.950 --> 37:07.783
by a Claire Zadoc at
Ellenville First National Bank.

37:07.820 --> 37:09.651
She bought 60 acres
out on Ridge Road.

37:09.690 --> 37:10.714
That's a cabin.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.978
There, near that
water tower.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.622
Hold on, I'm getting
a ping from Maria's cell.

37:14.660 --> 37:15.752
It's ten seconds.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.826
Probably turning it on and off,
looking for messages.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.338
She's on the Thruway
headed north.

37:21.370 --> 37:24.339
And if we know that,
then the cartel does, too.

37:33.080 --> 37:34.843
I'll cover you.
You get her.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.677
Okay.

37:43.460 --> 37:46.054
Maria, Carrie Wells, NYPD.

37:46.090 --> 37:48.593
I'm here to help you.

37:48.630 --> 37:50.291
Open the door.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.726
Please.

37:53.770 --> 37:55.067
I know you're scared,

37:55.100 --> 37:56.738
but I'm here to help.

37:56.770 --> 37:57.964
Now, listen, we have to go.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.672
Carrie, we got company.
Go. Get down, get down,

38:03.710 --> 38:05.644
get down. Shh.

38:07.350 --> 38:08.544
Claire-- she warned me.

38:08.580 --> 38:10.309
She said that if
something happened to her

38:10.350 --> 38:11.749
that I should run.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.940
That they could come after me.

38:13.990 --> 38:15.878
Did they kill her?

38:15.920 --> 38:18.354
No, they didn't kill her.
Now I need you to be quiet.

38:18.390 --> 38:20.324
Just stay calm, stay calm.

38:20.360 --> 38:23.488
Hey, Maria. You home?

38:23.530 --> 38:25.498
Don't answer. Shh.

38:25.530 --> 38:27.020
MAN: Maria.

38:29.540 --> 38:31.758
I'm gonna open the door.

38:31.810 --> 38:34.028
Stay down and be quiet.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.047
Buenos das, gentlemen.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.110
NYPD.

38:45.150 --> 38:47.789
You're surrounded.
Toss your weapons on the ground,

38:47.820 --> 38:50.084
hands in the air
and get on your knees. Now!

38:51.390 --> 38:52.687
Drop your weapons!

38:54.430 --> 38:56.022
Drop 'em!

38:56.060 --> 38:57.459
On the ground, face down.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.365
Face down. Go on.

39:20.020 --> 39:21.817
I got him.

39:56.860 --> 39:58.851
Hey,shh,shh,
shh,shh,shh.

40:03.000 --> 40:05.389
That's a cabin.

40:06.100 --> 40:07.499
There, near that
water tower.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.530
Shh, Shh.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.414
Drop your weapon!

40:41.540 --> 40:43.064
Nice.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.629
ELIOT:
The Feds have been

40:49.680 --> 40:53.207
doing this almost 45 years,
never lost a witness.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.878
You'll finally get that
fresh start, Maria.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.148
Thank you.

40:57.180 --> 41:00.183
And please, call me Claire.

41:00.220 --> 41:02.609
That's my name now.

41:06.560 --> 41:08.050
So...

41:08.090 --> 41:09.250
how's the commissioner?

41:09.300 --> 41:10.927
He happy we solved the case?

41:10.960 --> 41:13.497
Oh, no. I just found out
he's suing Gwen.

41:13.530 --> 41:16.693
Said she tricked him into
marrying a gold digger.

41:16.740 --> 41:19.163
That's what you get
when the blind lead the blind.

41:19.210 --> 41:21.064
Hmm.

41:21.110 --> 41:23.578
Did I just say that out loud?

41:23.610 --> 41:25.271
I never heard a word.

41:25.310 --> 41:26.971
Good.

41:30.750 --> 41:32.547
Fresh start.

41:32.590 --> 41:35.058
That sounds nice.

41:35.090 --> 41:36.580
You know,

41:36.620 --> 41:37.814
you never finished
telling me about

41:37.860 --> 41:39.657
your little
Bonnie and Clyde stint.

41:39.690 --> 41:42.659
I bet Bonnie and Clyde did not
need a matchmaking service.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.668
And look how well
they turned out.

41:44.700 --> 41:48.261
Do you really think people
need someone like Gwen Stein

41:48.300 --> 41:50.598
to, I don't know,
make the magic happen?

41:50.640 --> 41:51.664
No.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.632
I mean, look at us.

41:53.670 --> 41:54.830
We have the magic.

41:54.880 --> 41:56.529
We do?
Sure.

41:56.580 --> 41:58.878
You put a spell on me years ago.

41:58.910 --> 42:00.605
Aw.

42:00.650 --> 42:01.878
What kind of spell?

42:03.750 --> 42:05.741
I'll do anything you ask.

42:06.950 --> 42:08.986
Anything

42:09.020 --> 42:11.159
Within reason.

42:11.190 --> 42:13.021
We almost got arrested
in that closet

42:13.060 --> 42:14.823
at the Syracuse Library,
remember?

42:14.860 --> 42:16.259
Uh, do I remember that?

42:16.300 --> 42:18.768
I remember everything.
Of course you remember, yes.

42:18.800 --> 42:21.633
I tell you what,
how about an easy one.

42:21.670 --> 42:24.559
You let me buy you a drink.

42:24.610 --> 42:25.963
No, that is way too easy.

42:26.010 --> 42:27.136
Think of something
more exciting.

42:27.170 --> 42:29.274
I will.

42:29.310 --> 42:30.868
After that drink.

42:30.910 --> 42:32.639
Come on, Bonnie.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.671
Okay, Clyde.
