00:57.800 --> 01:01.967
We have a 2 appointment with
Dr. Ashley. The name is Zbornak.

01:02.033 --> 01:04.266
Mine's not Zbornak.
It's Devereaux.

01:04.333 --> 01:06.934
The appointment's
in the name of Zbornak.

01:07.033 --> 01:10.033
Why? It was my idea
to get counseling.

01:10.100 --> 01:12.300
Take the appointment for Zbornak.

01:12.367 --> 01:14.300
Change it to Nylund.
Satisfied?

01:14.367 --> 01:16.667
No. It should be under Devereaux.

01:16.734 --> 01:19.633
-It should be under Nylund.
-Change it back to Zbornak.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.734
Put it under Lipschitz
and buzz the headshrinker.

01:21.800 --> 01:23.867
We got an emergency here.

01:25.166 --> 01:27.066
Excuse me, ladies.
I'm Dr. Ashley.

01:27.133 --> 01:28.567
Won't you come into my office?

01:30.233 --> 01:31.667
I'm Sophia Petrillo.

01:31.734 --> 01:33.100
My idea of a psychiatrist

01:33.166 --> 01:35.533
is a bartender
who pours without a spout.

01:37.567 --> 01:40.066
-Doctor, I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
-Dorothy.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.000
I'm Rose Nylund.

01:42.066 --> 01:43.066
I'm Blanche Devereaux.

01:43.133 --> 01:46.333
I know it's not pertinent now,
but I'm double-jointed.

01:53.100 --> 01:54.433
That's very interesting.

01:55.834 --> 01:58.433
The reason we came
to the counseling center

01:58.500 --> 02:02.800
is we're roommates, and
we're having problems at home.

02:02.867 --> 02:06.734
Before we get to the nitty-gritty,
tell me about yourselves.

02:06.800 --> 02:09.266
Fine. I'm a teacher. I'm divorced--

02:09.333 --> 02:10.567
(Blanche) I'm a widow.

02:10.633 --> 02:13.867
No man would leave me
unless he absolutely had to.

02:15.133 --> 02:19.166
I'm 41. I'm 5'6",
I weigh 108 pounds,

02:19.233 --> 02:22.133
and my hair is its natural hue.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.133
Sure, Blanche.
Yours and Lucy's.

02:26.133 --> 02:27.700
What about you, Rose?

02:27.767 --> 02:32.066
Well, to be perfectly honest,
I use a touch of peroxide.

02:32.133 --> 02:33.900
Shut up, Rose.

02:33.967 --> 02:35.266
You shut up.

02:35.333 --> 02:38.300
Stop it!
I cannot stand it anymore.

02:38.367 --> 02:41.367
And I can't stand
that phony accent of yours.

02:41.433 --> 02:43.100
What is this, <i>Designing Women?</i>

02:45.867 --> 02:48.734
Doctor, we've been
together five years.

02:48.800 --> 02:50.667
We're just getting
on each other's nerves.

02:50.734 --> 02:52.166
Why is that?

02:52.233 --> 02:54.467
Because Dorothy
is impossible to live with.

02:54.533 --> 02:55.400
That's right.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.800
The real problem is you,
Blanche. You are selfish.

02:58.867 --> 03:02.867
Oh, please. Everybody says
what a giving person I am.

03:02.934 --> 03:05.333
She's talking about
when you're in an upright position.

03:08.867 --> 03:12.400
Dorothy, give an example
of how Blanche is selfish.

03:12.467 --> 03:13.867
All right. Fine.

03:13.934 --> 03:17.967
About a month ago,
I was not feeling very well.

03:18.033 --> 03:20.433
As a matter of fact,
I was sick as a dog.

03:24.233 --> 03:26.367
I'll be ready in a minute.

03:26.433 --> 03:29.500
Hannah did my make-up
while my pedicure was drying.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.867
All I have to do is change my shoes.

03:33.166 --> 03:35.767
Wait. What are you doing?

03:35.834 --> 03:38.233
I think I'm dying,

03:38.300 --> 03:41.800
but then again this 104 fever
may be clouding my judgment.

03:43.166 --> 03:45.266
Honey, look at what
you're wearing.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.767
You can't go like that.

03:46.834 --> 03:50.867
I think the funeral home
has someone who handles that.

03:51.900 --> 03:54.333
But thank you for caring.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.633
I'm talking about our double date.

03:56.700 --> 03:59.700
This place looks
like a hospital ward.

03:59.767 --> 04:02.467
Mike and Larry will
be here any minute.

04:02.533 --> 04:05.867
Blanche, I can't go out tonight.
Look at me.

04:05.934 --> 04:08.734
Dorothy, you've looked
much worse than this.

04:10.700 --> 04:13.533
Remember when you gave
yourself a home perm,

04:13.600 --> 04:15.066
burnt your hair right down
to the roots,

04:15.133 --> 04:17.100
and ended up looking
like buckwheat?

04:18.800 --> 04:21.533
I meant that I'm sick.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.667
I can barely stand.

04:23.734 --> 04:25.400
You'll just have
to go on without me.

04:25.467 --> 04:28.367
Go on without you?
This is not a wagon train.

04:28.433 --> 04:30.367
This is a double date.

04:32.166 --> 04:35.567
It's both of us or nothing.

04:35.633 --> 04:38.100
You'll just have to cancel too.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.967
Cancel my date?

04:40.033 --> 04:42.767
With Larry? Oh, Dorothy,

04:42.834 --> 04:45.300
how long have you been
inhaling this VapoRub?

04:46.867 --> 04:48.400
-Blanche!
-Dorothy,

04:48.467 --> 04:50.934
I've been waiting for Larry
to ask me out

04:51.000 --> 04:55.166
since our eyes met at Del's
route one Chevron.

04:57.967 --> 05:00.567
I climbed up on the hood
of his Lebaron

05:00.633 --> 05:02.934
and wrote my phone number
on his windshield

05:03.000 --> 05:05.266
with the heel of
my Pappagallo pump.

05:08.667 --> 05:11.834
Isn't that how Mrs. Simpson met
the Duke of Windsor?

05:13.000 --> 05:16.633
You promised you'd double-date
with Larry's friend mike.

05:16.700 --> 05:19.467
-I'm holding you to it.
-Blanche, I'm sick.

05:19.533 --> 05:20.567
You just have a cold.

05:20.633 --> 05:22.233
(coughs)

05:28.700 --> 05:31.533
See? You just have
a little throat tickle.

05:33.066 --> 05:38.633
-Okay, come on. Let's go.
-Blanche, please, my body aches.

05:38.700 --> 05:41.500
So does mine, honey. That's
why I want to go on this date.

05:46.200 --> 05:48.266
Blanche, I am miserable.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.500
It's mind over matter.
You can do it.

05:51.567 --> 05:53.734
You can get up.
You feel better already.

05:53.800 --> 05:58.400
You can heal yourself.
Walk, Dorothy, walk!

06:02.367 --> 06:04.667
Just because you put make-up on
with a butter knife

06:04.734 --> 06:06.767
doesn't make you
Tammy Bakker.

06:15.300 --> 06:17.600
I'm not killing myself

06:17.667 --> 06:20.700
because you have the hots
for some guy in a fancy car.

06:20.767 --> 06:23.734
Dorothy,
Larry's very important to me.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.700
You picked him up
at a gas station.

06:26.767 --> 06:29.500
He must've been impressed
with your spare tire.

06:32.567 --> 06:34.200
I cannot believe you're doing
this to me.

06:34.266 --> 06:37.266
And I can't believe
that you're so selfish.

06:37.333 --> 06:40.066
Drink this.
It'll make you feel better.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.500
Another hot toddy?
I think I've had enough.

06:43.567 --> 06:45.734
Shut up and drink.

06:45.800 --> 06:48.333
This is the fourth.
That's a lot of whiskey.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.066
I only put whiskey
in the first one.

06:51.133 --> 06:52.433
Oh.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.734
The second and third
were vodka.

06:55.800 --> 06:58.300
Oh.

06:58.367 --> 07:00.166
No wonder my head is spinning.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.700
This one's part amaretto,
part sambuca.

07:02.767 --> 07:05.433
That should kill everything.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.900
It killed your father.

07:10.166 --> 07:12.834
Dorothy?
Dorothy!

07:12.900 --> 07:15.633
She's out cold.
A fever's very tiring.

07:15.700 --> 07:18.066
Help me get her
into the bedroom.

07:18.133 --> 07:19.667
I think she's comfortable here.

07:19.734 --> 07:21.767
Oh, all right.

07:21.834 --> 07:23.100
I'll just prop her up.

07:23.166 --> 07:25.600
Mike's not that particular.
He just got out of prison.

07:32.233 --> 07:33.800
It was absolutely dreadful.

07:33.867 --> 07:37.000
I kept going in
and out of consciousness

07:37.066 --> 07:41.367
while a guy with a silver tooth
and a scorpion tattoo

07:41.433 --> 07:44.600
tried to grope me
through the Vicks VapoRub.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.467
Oh, stop your complaining.

07:46.533 --> 07:48.333
Mike was a very nice man.

07:48.400 --> 07:50.333
He burned down
a diner in Arkansas

07:50.400 --> 07:52.367
because his eggs were runny.

07:53.667 --> 07:56.066
Blanche, you owe
Dorothy an apology.

07:56.133 --> 07:58.867
-Shut up.
-Don't you say that.

07:58.934 --> 08:01.500
Ok, I will. Shut up, Rose.

08:02.000 --> 08:06.533
Doctor, they're always telling me
to shut up. Why is that?

08:06.600 --> 08:09.934
-Well--
-Every time I open my mouth...

08:10.000 --> 08:11.700
-Rose--
-...they jump on me.

08:11.767 --> 08:15.066
They say I babble.
I don't. People who--

08:15.133 --> 08:16.567
Shut up, Rose!

08:20.233 --> 08:24.300
I mean, I think things
would be more productive

08:24.367 --> 08:27.934
if we conducted things
in a more orderly fashion.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.700
See? She's an airhead.

08:30.767 --> 08:32.667
Oh, yeah?
You're a barbell.

08:32.734 --> 08:34.700
That's a dumbbell, you twit.

08:35.767 --> 08:38.266
Ladies, ladies,
please calm down.

08:38.333 --> 08:41.066
Who can give us an example
that will illustrate exactly

08:41.133 --> 08:43.000
what you're trying
to say about Rose?

08:43.066 --> 08:45.400
I've got the perfect example.

08:45.467 --> 08:48.800
Dorothy was on summer vacation
looking for a part-time job.

08:48.867 --> 08:51.633
She asks Rose to put her ad
in the classifieds.

08:51.700 --> 08:53.834
That was a mistake right away.

08:54.667 --> 08:57.000
Rose, it's not here.

08:57.066 --> 08:58.667
Look again. It has to be.

08:58.734 --> 09:02.700
I've read every want ad.
Mine's not here.

09:02.767 --> 09:05.233
Are you sure
you dropped it off?

09:05.300 --> 09:09.033
You told me what to do
a dozen times.

09:09.100 --> 09:10.333
Any idiot could've done it.

09:10.400 --> 09:13.233
I know, but you were the only one
going downtown.

09:14.734 --> 09:17.934
Are you sure you dropped it off
at the newspaper?

09:18.000 --> 09:21.033
Yes. Six people called
while you were out.

09:21.100 --> 09:23.266
I'll find it for you.

09:23.333 --> 09:24.900
(doorbell rings)

09:29.834 --> 09:30.867
Dorothy?

09:30.934 --> 09:31.967
Have we met?

09:32.033 --> 09:34.800
Not yet.
I'm here because of your ad.

09:34.867 --> 09:38.333
"Willing to do anything.
$8 an hour."

09:38.400 --> 09:40.166
Yes, of course.
Please come in.

09:40.233 --> 09:43.200
I didn't expect people
to actually come here.

09:43.266 --> 09:45.667
I figured I'd be going to them.

09:45.734 --> 09:47.633
That's how it will work

09:47.700 --> 09:50.467
when my video camera
gets back from the shop.

09:51.367 --> 09:54.633
What type of work is it, Mr...

09:54.700 --> 09:55.867
-Toto.
-Mr. Toto.

09:55.934 --> 09:58.567
No mister. Just Toto.

09:58.633 --> 10:00.934
You're Dorothy, and I'm Toto.

10:05.233 --> 10:07.333
At least for the next $8.

10:10.133 --> 10:13.633
You owe me an apology.
Your ad's right here.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.133
Oh, Rose,
this is the personals column.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.567
So, what?

10:18.633 --> 10:20.266
You put an ad
in the personals column

10:20.333 --> 10:22.967
saying I'll do anything
for $8 an hour?

10:24.033 --> 10:27.100
Look. It's right
under an ad that reads,

10:27.166 --> 10:30.500
"History professor seeking
non-smoking oriental woman

10:30.567 --> 10:32.166
who's into Wesson oil

10:32.233 --> 10:35.100
and bears a resemblance
to Florence Henderson."

10:37.133 --> 10:39.000
-Is that signed "Doug"?
-Yes.

10:39.066 --> 10:41.400
I know him.
He's a sick man.

10:42.700 --> 10:46.166
I'm terribly sorry for this mix-up.
Goodbye.

10:48.767 --> 10:52.400
Oh, my God!
I don't believe this!

10:52.467 --> 10:56.500
I'm going to call the cops
if you don't get out, you pervert.

10:56.567 --> 10:58.700
Hi, father Rossi.

10:58.767 --> 11:00.734
Here's the canned
goods for the needy.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.166
Oh, no.

11:04.734 --> 11:06.633
I'm terribly sorry.

11:06.700 --> 11:10.300
I promise I'll say Hail Marys
until Madonna has a hit movie.

11:14.200 --> 11:17.166
Hi. Here's my $8.
Let's get started, Dorothy.

11:17.233 --> 11:18.900
I'm not Dorothy.
She is.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.800
I'll give you $4.
Let's get started.

11:24.734 --> 11:27.667
How would you like your rear
end kicked across the street?

11:27.734 --> 11:29.467
Oh, great. Here's the other $4.

11:32.166 --> 11:34.266
Girls, girls.

11:34.333 --> 11:37.333
There is a busload
of Greek sailors out front.

11:39.066 --> 11:42.200
They want to know
how many drachma there are in $8.

11:46.633 --> 11:49.500
It was an honest mistake.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.767
Besides,
something good came out of it.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.767
We learned to make souvlaki.

11:55.967 --> 11:57.333
The point is, Rose,

11:57.400 --> 11:59.834
you do these stupid things
all the time,

11:59.900 --> 12:02.700
or you're saying
something stupid,

12:02.767 --> 12:05.867
or wearing something stupid,
or cooking something stupid.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.934
Rose, what about Blanche
saying these things?

12:09.000 --> 12:10.967
I think she's a <i>Gerkochanachen.</i>

12:12.967 --> 12:14.700
What exactly does that mean?

12:14.767 --> 12:18.367
Literally, it's the precise moment
when dog doo turns white.

12:26.567 --> 12:29.834
But, in general,
it refers to the kind of person

12:29.900 --> 12:33.266
you don't want to share
your <i>Hudenkagels</i> with.

12:33.767 --> 12:36.867
If you say one more
of those stupid words--

12:36.934 --> 12:38.834
Oh, blow it out your <i>Tubbenburbels.</i>

12:39.333 --> 12:43.000
-How dare you!
-(all arguing)

12:52.633 --> 12:56.166
Sometimes I think if I have to
live with her one more week.

12:56.233 --> 13:00.133
Ladies, ladies, please.

13:00.200 --> 13:02.767
Now, we're not going to get
anything more accomplished

13:02.834 --> 13:06.166
unless you sit down, take it easy
and discuss this rationally.

13:06.233 --> 13:08.066
Using only English words.

13:10.567 --> 13:14.834
Now, we talked about Rose,
we talked about Blanche.

13:14.900 --> 13:16.934
Nobody has said
a word about Dorothy.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.633
That's because they
are afraid of her.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.166
No, we are not.

13:22.233 --> 13:23.500
But we do have
a problem with her.

13:23.567 --> 13:26.367
What specifically
is it about Dorothy

13:26.433 --> 13:28.033
that is disruptive to the household.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.333
It's nothing specific.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.767
It's her entire general attitude.

13:31.834 --> 13:33.600
Like, that time
a couple of weeks ago.

13:33.667 --> 13:36.500
It was a week before...

13:36.567 --> 13:38.533
-(knock at door)
-Come in.

13:40.166 --> 13:42.333
-Hi, Dorothy.
-Oh, hi, Rose.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.333
How's the studying going?

13:44.400 --> 13:47.767
I still have a lot to cover
I'm gonna be up for quite a while.

13:47.834 --> 13:49.300
Okay, I'll just
keep you company.

13:49.367 --> 13:51.200
I don't want any company.

13:51.266 --> 13:53.233
Just pretend I'm not here.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.300
Ah, goody, a slumber party.
Mind if I join you?

13:59.367 --> 14:01.166
What is the matter with you two?

14:01.233 --> 14:02.900
What makes you think
something's the matter?

14:02.967 --> 14:06.934
Okay, I wanna see six hands
above that blanket, right now.

14:11.867 --> 14:15.533
The only reason we're in bed
with Dorothy is, we're scared.

14:15.600 --> 14:16.667
Scared of what?

14:16.734 --> 14:20.934
Dorothy, don't you laugh
but we're scared of the aliens.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.867
Blanche, how many
times have I told you

14:22.934 --> 14:24.667
not to call them the aliens.

14:24.734 --> 14:27.700
They are the Cheungs
and they happen to be very nice.

14:27.767 --> 14:30.166
They are not very nice,
they eat dogs.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.867
Ma, they do not eat dogs.

14:32.934 --> 14:35.266
Right, it's just
a coincidence that not one

14:35.333 --> 14:36.767
ever pees on their lawn.

14:38.700 --> 14:40.266
Ma, you made that up.

14:40.333 --> 14:44.133
Sophia, we're not talking
about them anyway.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.133
We're talking about
the aliens from outer space.

14:46.200 --> 14:47.767
Oh, those, aliens.

14:47.834 --> 14:50.300
-Get out. Both of you.
-Dorothy, now, have a heart.

14:50.367 --> 14:54.166
Rose and I rented that movie aliens
and just scared us half to death.

14:54.233 --> 14:57.133
Scared me too. That
Sigourney Weaver is a sweet girl

14:57.200 --> 14:59.834
but she really shouldn't go
without make-up.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.500
I don't have time for this.

15:03.567 --> 15:07.767
Now, I have my education
exam tomorrow morning.

15:07.834 --> 15:10.600
-You mean, you're kicking us out.
-Rose, I have to study.

15:10.667 --> 15:14.467
That's my Dorothy,
always with her nose in a book.

15:14.533 --> 15:15.667
Unlike your brother Fill

15:15.734 --> 15:17.700
who was always with his nose
in the dirty clothes hamper.

15:18.900 --> 15:21.233
I cannot believe you
would be so cold-blooded.

15:21.300 --> 15:25.266
As to cast out your two dearest
friends in this, their time of need.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.500
And I can't believe the
two of you are so inconsiderate

15:28.567 --> 15:31.166
that you would disturb me
with something this ridiculous.

15:31.233 --> 15:33.567
When you know
how important my exam is.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.734
If I don't pass it,
I don't get my raise.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.867
That's it. Everybody out.

15:37.934 --> 15:39.700
Sophia, we're scared.

15:39.767 --> 15:42.700
I'm scared too that we won't be able
to afford meat on the table.

15:42.767 --> 15:45.100
You want to wind up swapping
recipes with the Cheungs?

15:45.166 --> 15:46.467
Out! Out!

15:51.800 --> 15:53.500
Ladies, I am not
sure I understand.

15:53.567 --> 15:55.734
What you want, subtitles.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.700
Dorothy was perfectly reasonable.

15:58.767 --> 16:01.333
You were pestering her.
She was more than patient.

16:01.400 --> 16:04.166
Exactly, and I've had it up to here.

16:04.233 --> 16:07.667
It's not easy, living with somebody
who's always so together.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.166
She's so efficient, so organized.

16:10.233 --> 16:11.834
She even balances her checkbook.

16:13.266 --> 16:15.300
Since when is
competence a crime?

16:15.367 --> 16:19.100
Look, Dorothy cannot be
blamed for being capable.

16:19.166 --> 16:24.266
She doesn't have to criticize us
for not living up to her standards.

16:24.333 --> 16:28.033
She's always harping on us
to do everything just right.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.800
I'm surprised she doesn't
check our underwear

16:29.867 --> 16:31.400
before we leave the house.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.900
Those of you who wear underwear.

16:47.200 --> 16:50.367
Maybe I am a perfectionist.
Maybe I do take charge.

16:50.433 --> 16:54.133
But if I didn't,
our household would crumble.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.300
(Sophia)
Truthfully, doctor,

16:56.367 --> 16:58.266
I'm the glue that keeps
these women together,

16:58.333 --> 17:01.934
-and I am totally unappreciated.
-Oh, Ma, please.

17:02.000 --> 17:04.800
You may be smart,
but I'm wise.

17:04.867 --> 17:09.300
I'm the one who sets
the real problems straight.

17:09.367 --> 17:12.900
Listen to this story, doctor,
and be the judge.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.633
Sophia, are you busy?

17:15.700 --> 17:19.266
I'm just drawing a line
on the milk of magnesia bottle.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.000
Why?

17:20.066 --> 17:22.767
The gardener's
been sneaking some sips.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.500
I have a problem.

17:25.567 --> 17:27.834
All right. Take a sip.
I'll draw another line.

17:29.900 --> 17:30.934
It's not that.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.867
My boss made a pass at me.

17:34.367 --> 17:36.400
Maybe you misunderstood.
What did he do?

17:36.467 --> 17:40.433
He threw me down on the couch
and kissed me.

17:40.934 --> 17:42.000
That's a pass.

17:43.567 --> 17:45.700
I think I can help you.

17:45.767 --> 17:47.734
I'll tell you a story.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.834
Picture it... Sicily, 1922.

17:52.333 --> 17:54.033
Sophia, I have a problem.

17:54.100 --> 17:57.467
I saw the guy I'm dating
out with another woman.

17:57.533 --> 17:58.734
What should I do?

17:58.800 --> 18:01.734
You should sit down
and picture Sicily, 1922.

18:03.233 --> 18:07.266
It was the worst of times,
it was the worst of times.

18:08.834 --> 18:11.000
It was Sicily, 1922.

18:11.066 --> 18:13.300
Ma, I have a problem.

18:13.367 --> 18:14.900
Just sit down and listen.

18:14.967 --> 18:17.934
Is everyone who lives
here present right now?

18:18.000 --> 18:18.867
Yes.

18:18.934 --> 18:22.633
Then for the last time,
picture it, Sicily, 1922.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.333
A beautiful young woman

18:25.400 --> 18:27.967
with breasts not unlike
Brigitte Nielsen,

18:28.033 --> 18:30.467
except hers moved
when she skipped.

18:32.800 --> 18:36.333
She comes walking down
a picturesque country road,

18:36.400 --> 18:39.934
when suddenly a yellow
Rolls-Royce pulls up

18:40.000 --> 18:41.100
and blocks her path.

18:41.166 --> 18:43.000
Who was in the rolls?

18:43.066 --> 18:46.834
Robert Goulet, who knows?
It's not important to the story.

18:46.900 --> 18:49.400
Anyway, the Rolls-Royce moves on,

18:49.467 --> 18:51.867
and the girl finds her pepperoni
is missing.

18:55.266 --> 18:56.734
What happened to it, Sophia?

18:56.800 --> 18:59.433
Bambi ate it.
How should I know?

18:59.500 --> 19:00.700
You keep missing the point.

19:00.767 --> 19:05.100
She has no pepperoni
to bring to her family's table.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.667
She gets hysterical.
She starts to run.

19:07.734 --> 19:12.600
She runs through fields and meadows,
until she reaches a raging river

19:12.667 --> 19:15.567
filled with pepperoni
swimming upstream.

19:17.000 --> 19:20.834
Ma, pepperoni
swimming upstream?

19:20.900 --> 19:24.467
It's odd. Pepperoni's a land meat,
but there it was.

19:25.834 --> 19:28.567
She wades into the river,
grabs an armful,

19:28.633 --> 19:30.900
and races to feed her family.

19:30.967 --> 19:34.166
They think the story's
an act of God.

19:34.233 --> 19:38.333
But as it turned out,
a disgruntled pepperoni stuffer

19:38.400 --> 19:41.033
had blown up
a neighboring town's factory,

19:41.100 --> 19:44.867
causing pepperoni to rain down
over 100 square miles,

19:44.934 --> 19:46.767
which is where the Sicilian saying,

19:46.834 --> 19:49.233
"it's raining cats and pepperoni,"
comes from.

19:51.967 --> 19:54.066
Is this helping anyone yet?

19:54.133 --> 19:56.333
Because this sure feels
like an ending to me.

19:57.867 --> 19:59.767
Oh, it's helping me, Sophia.

19:59.834 --> 20:03.266
To me, it meant I should
take a bad situation

20:03.333 --> 20:04.800
and make it better.

20:04.867 --> 20:07.066
I'm telling my boss off.

20:07.133 --> 20:09.200
I got something else.

20:09.266 --> 20:12.000
I thought you meant dump
my cheating boyfriend,

20:12.066 --> 20:14.600
because there's lots
of pepperoni in the sea.

20:15.633 --> 20:17.800
That's exactly what I meant.

20:17.867 --> 20:19.533
Thank you, Sophia.

20:19.600 --> 20:21.734
Dorothy, did I help you
with your problem?

20:21.800 --> 20:24.800
Sure, you solved
my dinner problem.

20:24.867 --> 20:26.967
How about splitting
a pepperoni pizza?

20:29.100 --> 20:30.400
Sure. You buying?

20:30.467 --> 20:32.433
Does a pepperoni swim upstream?

20:33.400 --> 20:35.066
Did once. Let's go.

20:37.266 --> 20:40.300
I'm afraid I don't understand,
Sophia.

20:40.367 --> 20:42.934
They look up to you.
They seek your advice.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.834
They respect your opinion.

20:44.900 --> 20:47.200
What exactly is your complaint?

20:47.266 --> 20:49.967
I don't get $150 an hour like you.

20:51.367 --> 20:53.333
What should we do?

20:53.400 --> 20:55.000
In my experience,

20:55.066 --> 20:58.567
most domestic problems
can usually be resolved

20:58.633 --> 21:01.066
through a willingness
to cooperate and hard work.

21:01.133 --> 21:04.967
You're saying if we become
more tolerant of each other,

21:05.033 --> 21:06.400
we'll work things out.

21:06.467 --> 21:08.533
In your case,
there's really no point.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.767
You are totally incompatible.

21:11.266 --> 21:12.200
What?

21:12.266 --> 21:14.734
You are incompatible.

21:14.800 --> 21:17.233
You bring out the worst
traits in each other.

21:17.300 --> 21:21.066
I'm surprised you
haven't killed each other.

21:22.066 --> 21:25.533
But, Dr. Ashley,
we came here for you to help us.

21:25.600 --> 21:28.467
Ladies, I like you.

21:28.533 --> 21:31.000
Save your money
for the moving expenses.

21:38.266 --> 21:39.200
Well...

21:40.133 --> 21:41.300
Thank you, Doctor.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.467
It was... difficult to hear, but...

21:46.367 --> 21:47.834
you're probably right.

21:52.033 --> 21:54.700
If you were a legitimate shrink,

21:54.767 --> 21:57.000
you would have strung us along
for months.

22:04.867 --> 22:08.533
I guess tomorrow morning,
we can start to pack...

22:09.300 --> 22:09.967
can't we?

22:10.033 --> 22:13.433
Yeah, I guess
that's probably the best thing.

22:13.500 --> 22:16.100
Dr. Ashley was right, wasn't he?

22:16.166 --> 22:22.100
Absolutely. Of course, it doesn't
mean we can't still be friends.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.900
You know,
we'll visit each other,

22:24.967 --> 22:27.867
it's just that...
we can't live together.

22:28.767 --> 22:29.700
Right?

22:30.667 --> 22:31.700
What's going on?

22:31.767 --> 22:34.533
We were just discussing
going our separate ways.

22:34.600 --> 22:35.767
Interesting.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.300
You think that's best?

22:37.367 --> 22:38.533
I didn't say that.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.000
You think we should stay together?

22:41.066 --> 22:42.000
Didn't say that, either.

22:42.066 --> 22:43.600
What should we do?

22:43.667 --> 22:45.000
It's not for me to say.

22:47.934 --> 22:49.734
But I'll tell you a story.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.467
Picture it, Miami, 1987.

22:52.533 --> 22:55.633
The only house in the neighborhood
without a pool.

22:57.166 --> 23:01.333
But I digress.
Four women, friends.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.834
They laugh, they cry, they eat.

23:03.900 --> 23:05.834
They love, hate, and eat.

23:05.900 --> 23:09.000
They dream, hope, eat. Every
time you turn around, they eat.

23:10.533 --> 23:13.266
Sophia, are those
four women us?

23:13.333 --> 23:15.233
Look in the mirror, blubber butt.

23:17.900 --> 23:22.033
The point I'm making is,
what's going on here is living.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.333
Just because
you have some rough times

23:24.400 --> 23:27.200
doesn't mean
you throw in the towel.

23:27.266 --> 23:28.767
You go on living...

23:29.500 --> 23:30.600
and eating.

23:37.867 --> 23:39.266
I'll get the cheesecake.

23:41.233 --> 23:42.700
I'll get the whipped cream.

23:42.767 --> 23:45.033
I'll get the chocolate syrup.

23:45.100 --> 23:47.633
I'll get the polaroid.
This is a time to remember.

23:49.066 --> 23:50.967
You don't have a polaroid.

23:51.033 --> 23:53.033
Mine's under my bed.

23:53.100 --> 23:55.967
I have to get the whipped cream
from there anyway.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.767
(theme music playing)
