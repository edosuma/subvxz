01:25.354 --> 01:28.482
All right. Home sweet home.

01:28.557 --> 01:31.993
Hey. The new poster. Huh.

01:32.061 --> 01:34.256
What do you think?
- He looks mad, don't he?

01:34.330 --> 01:37.731
Yeah. Because he knows you're going
home with that championship belt.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.563
That's why he's mad.

01:39.635 --> 01:42.195
Come on.
Let's get started, huh?

01:42.271 --> 01:44.262
Get the heart going.

01:47.743 --> 01:50.507
Hey. Eddie. What the hell
are you doing here?

01:50.579 --> 01:52.206
You been here all night?

01:52.281 --> 01:53.839
I must have fallen
asleep back there.

01:53.916 --> 01:56.316
Jesus. I hope to hell
he didn't heave.

01:56.385 --> 01:57.374
I'm not cleaning it up.

01:57.453 --> 02:00.388
Hey. Lay off Eddie.
He's my good luck charm.

02:00.456 --> 02:02.890
I wasn't much luck
five years ago.

02:02.959 --> 02:04.586
That's ancient history, Eddie.

02:06.295 --> 02:09.560
Here, man. Here's 10 bucks.

02:09.632 --> 02:11.930
Why don't you grab yourself
some breakfast?

02:12.001 --> 02:14.595
Something on a plate.
Not in a bottle.

02:15.071 --> 02:16.971
Thanks, champ.
I'll put it on my tab.

02:17.039 --> 02:20.372
Well, I'm not the champ, yet.
Yeah. Well, you will be.

02:20.443 --> 02:23.435
And I wouldn't worry too much
about that fight next week.

02:23.512 --> 02:26.879
He'll be sucking canvas.
I guarantee it.

02:26.949 --> 02:31.215
You've just got to remember
two things. Lean into him!

02:31.287 --> 02:34.188
Stay in his face!
And number two...

02:40.696 --> 02:43.290
It's a jungle out there

02:43.366 --> 02:46.301
Disorder and confusion
everywhere

02:47.803 --> 02:50.135
No one seems to care

02:50.206 --> 02:51.230
Well, I do

02:51.307 --> 02:54.037
Hey, who's in charge here?

02:54.110 --> 02:56.544
It's a jungle out there

02:57.980 --> 03:01.211
Poison in the very
air we breathe

03:01.283 --> 03:03.649
You know what's in the water
that you drink?

03:03.719 --> 03:04.708
Well, I do

03:04.787 --> 03:07.984
It's amazing

03:08.057 --> 03:09.524
People think I'm crazy

03:09.592 --> 03:11.082
'cause I worry
all the time

03:11.160 --> 03:14.527
If you paid attention,
you'd be worried, too

03:14.597 --> 03:15.928
You better pay attention

03:15.998 --> 03:18.762
Or this world
we love so much

03:18.834 --> 03:21.962
might just kill you

03:22.671 --> 03:24.832
I could be wrong now

03:24.907 --> 03:26.738
But I don't think so

03:26.809 --> 03:29.175
'Cause there's
a jungle out there

03:29.545 --> 03:31.740
It's a jungle out there

03:45.327 --> 03:47.090
Thank you for coming.

03:47.530 --> 03:49.430
Oh. You're redecorating?

03:49.498 --> 03:51.898
Yeah. It's stolen art.
There's a rumor some guy

03:51.967 --> 03:53.400
in the city has been
buying it all up.

03:53.469 --> 03:55.232
We're supposed to keep an eye
out for it. Have a seat.

03:55.304 --> 03:56.931
Oh. Is that why
you're calling us in?

03:57.006 --> 03:58.473
I wish.

04:00.476 --> 04:02.603
You used to be on the track
team in high school, right?

04:02.678 --> 04:03.838
Yeah.
Do you still run?

04:03.913 --> 04:06.711
Sometimes.
How often?

04:06.782 --> 04:08.875
Never.
That's not very often.

04:08.951 --> 04:11.351
No.
What's going on?

04:11.420 --> 04:14.981
There is a private detective
in San Diego named Rafferty.

04:15.057 --> 04:18.356
He works with the Homicide Squad
down there as a consultant.

04:18.427 --> 04:20.952
A couple of weeks ago, they
were chasing down some creep,

04:21.029 --> 04:22.588
and Rafferty
had a heart attack.

04:22.665 --> 04:24.690
The creep gets away. Now,
Rafferty is suing the city.

04:24.767 --> 04:27.235
The city is suing Rafferty.
It's a train wreck.

04:27.303 --> 04:30.704
Okay. So, what does this have
to do with, you know, me?

04:30.773 --> 04:35.540
This is from Sacramento.
It is a statewide directive.

04:35.611 --> 04:37.738
Effective a week
from Monday.

04:37.813 --> 04:41.112
Any civilian crime
scene field consultant

04:41.183 --> 04:44.050
must pass a mandatory
fitness test.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.417
Fitness test.

04:45.488 --> 04:48.548
The California
Physical Agility Test.

04:48.624 --> 04:51.286
The candidate must run a half
a mile in four minutes,

04:51.360 --> 04:53.089
then climb ten
flights of stairs,

04:53.162 --> 04:57.326
do 20 pull-ups, and then,
scale a six-foot-high wall.

04:58.634 --> 05:00.659
Or...
There is no "or."

05:00.736 --> 05:03.364
There's no "or"
on this page, Monk.

05:03.439 --> 05:04.838
Either you pass this
fitness test,

05:04.907 --> 05:07.171
or you can't
work here anymore.

05:15.317 --> 05:17.182
Where did you get
that suit?

05:17.253 --> 05:19.619
Kevin Dorfman.
It was a birthday gift.

05:19.688 --> 05:22.714
I never thought I'd get
the chance to wear it.

05:25.161 --> 05:26.788
What's so funny?

05:27.463 --> 05:29.294
What's so funny?

05:29.365 --> 05:31.925
That girl over there.
She was just doing a funny dance.

05:32.001 --> 05:33.935
Which one?

05:34.003 --> 05:36.801
Um. In the green sweater.
She's stopped, now.

05:36.872 --> 05:39.363
What kind of dance?
I don't know.

05:39.441 --> 05:42.740
Like a cowboy dance.
A funny cowboy dance.

05:42.811 --> 05:46.076
A cowboy dance?
Yeah. Like...

05:49.218 --> 05:50.776
Yeah. That's not
a cowboy dance.

05:50.853 --> 05:53.117
That's more like
a happy prospector.

05:53.189 --> 05:56.249
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Why was she dancing like...

05:56.325 --> 05:57.553
I don't know, Mr. Monk.
...a prospector?

05:57.626 --> 06:00.390
She's from a ranch, probably.
Can we just forget that now

06:00.462 --> 06:02.123
and get back to this?

06:02.198 --> 06:04.996
All right? Come on. I have
to run half a mile in

06:05.067 --> 06:06.864
four minutes, and I've
got to climb that fence,

06:06.936 --> 06:08.927
do some pull-ups, and then
hit those stairs. Right?

06:09.004 --> 06:11.768
Right. Okay. All right.
Here we go. Here we go.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.330
On your mark!

06:14.977 --> 06:16.535
Get set.

06:18.147 --> 06:19.409
Go!
Go!

06:42.871 --> 06:44.395
Oh, God!

06:46.442 --> 06:49.468
Are you okay?
Yeah, don't stop the clock.

06:49.545 --> 06:51.445
Are you okay?
I can do this. Don't stop.

06:51.513 --> 06:53.105
No, no, no. Just stay there.
Just stay there.

06:53.182 --> 06:54.809
Don't get up.
Just stay there.

06:54.883 --> 06:56.111
God.

06:56.919 --> 06:59.649
Hello? Yeah. No,
we're at the track.

07:00.723 --> 07:02.247
Oh, my God.

07:02.324 --> 07:03.757
Oh, my God.
We're on our way.

07:03.826 --> 07:06.294
Wait, wait. Mr. Monk. There's
been a bombing downtown.

07:06.362 --> 07:08.455
We have to go now.
Okay?

07:08.530 --> 07:10.498
So, give me your hand.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

07:10.566 --> 07:13.034
Here. Here, here.
One, two, three!

07:13.869 --> 07:15.302
Okay.

07:18.207 --> 07:21.233
Well, we found the detonator.
It's called a tembler switch.

07:21.310 --> 07:24.404
It's what they use in airbags.
It's motion sensitive.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.209
It's actually pretty
sophisticated.

07:26.282 --> 07:28.512
The bomb was meant for me.
- Yes, sir.

07:28.584 --> 07:29.676
Your schedule is well known.

07:29.752 --> 07:31.083
You're always the
first one here.

07:31.153 --> 07:33.121
The killer figured you'd be
the one hitting that bag.

07:33.188 --> 07:36.316
Yeah, Mr. Regis.
Ray. Machine.

07:36.392 --> 07:38.087
Do you have any enemies,

07:38.160 --> 07:39.627
or have you received
any threats lately?

07:39.695 --> 07:41.219
Not lately.

07:41.297 --> 07:43.265
Five years ago, when I lost
the title, it seemed like

07:43.332 --> 07:44.924
everybody wanted my head,
but...

07:45.000 --> 07:46.126
That was a tough night.

07:46.201 --> 07:48.567
I thought you had
him in the fifth.

07:48.637 --> 07:51.128
Yeah. It wasn't my night.
Well, it's a tough racket.

07:51.206 --> 07:54.334
I do a little boxing myself.
Light middleweight.

07:54.410 --> 07:56.071
When did you box?

07:56.145 --> 07:58.204
Remember the benefit for
the Police Athlete League?

07:58.280 --> 07:59.838
I took Sergeant Mulroony
in nine rounds.

07:59.915 --> 08:01.212
T.K.O. Left uppercut.

08:01.283 --> 08:03.843
Stan Mulroony?
He retired 12 years ago.

08:03.919 --> 08:04.977
We called him Pops.

08:05.054 --> 08:06.419
Yeah, that's right.
He was older than me.

08:06.488 --> 08:08.615
He was experienced.
He was wily.

08:08.691 --> 08:10.625
He had a cane.
And he used it.

08:10.693 --> 08:13.127
Captain.
Yeah. Anything?

08:13.195 --> 08:15.789
A whole lot of nothing.
He wore gloves and slippers.

08:15.864 --> 08:17.991
This guy was a ghost.

08:18.067 --> 08:20.661
Is this the bag?
What's left of it.

08:22.471 --> 08:23.768
The thread.

08:24.306 --> 08:25.295
Sir?

08:26.809 --> 08:28.470
When the killer put the
bomb back in the bag,

08:28.544 --> 08:30.569
he sewed it up and
he licked that thread.

08:30.646 --> 08:31.977
Do you see it's
all twisted up?

08:32.047 --> 08:34.140
There should be
DNA all over that.

08:34.216 --> 08:36.342
We'll check it out.

08:36.418 --> 08:38.943
Can we start packing up?
Uh, no. Let's wait for Monk.

08:39.020 --> 08:40.682
He should be here
in a minute.

08:40.756 --> 08:43.190
Adrian Monk? The detective?
He's supposed to be the best.

08:43.258 --> 08:46.523
The best of the best.
He's kind of like a superhero.

08:46.595 --> 08:49.655
He's good,
but I wouldn't call him a superhero.

08:52.868 --> 08:54.233
I guess I stand corrected.

08:54.303 --> 08:56.897
Looks like a big plum.
How did it go?

08:56.972 --> 08:58.940
It went good. You know.
It was our first day.

08:59.007 --> 09:01.134
So, just warming up.
But he's going to do great.

09:01.210 --> 09:03.110
Yeah. I went about 30 yards.

09:03.178 --> 09:05.305
Did you hit a wall?
I wish I had.

09:05.381 --> 09:07.747
It would have knocked
me unconscious.

09:07.816 --> 09:10.376
Adrian Monk.
Ray "The Machine" Regis.

09:10.452 --> 09:11.714
This is his manager,
Louie Flynn.

09:11.787 --> 09:13.379
Mr. Monk. It's an honor.
Oh.

09:13.455 --> 09:14.979
When I heard you were coming,
I said to myself,

09:15.057 --> 09:17.252
"Okay. We're going to be okay.
We're in good hands.

09:17.326 --> 09:19.521
"Because this guy, Monk,
will find Eddie's killer.

09:19.595 --> 09:22.564
"He's like me. He's a fighter.
He'll never give up."

09:22.631 --> 09:25.759
This is my last case.
This is not your last case.

09:25.834 --> 09:27.768
You weren't there.

09:28.904 --> 09:32.897
He looks like
a big, sad plum.

09:41.517 --> 09:45.351
A half mile in four minutes?
No. That's just part of it.

09:45.421 --> 09:48.481
It can't be done.
Yeah. People do it every day.

09:48.557 --> 09:50.957
Not people my age.
That's not true.

09:51.026 --> 09:54.018
Not people my age
with my body.

09:54.096 --> 09:58.965
I knew I was getting old,
but when did I get too old?

09:59.034 --> 10:01.400
Adrian, I think you're being
a little too hard on yourself.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.836
I mean, you haven't run
in, what, 30 years?

10:03.906 --> 10:07.569
Oh, well. It doesn't matter.
I can't do it.

10:07.643 --> 10:10.476
Last night,
I made a decision.

10:10.546 --> 10:14.004
I quit. It's over. I just...
I'm giving up.

10:15.350 --> 10:17.375
Just like that?
Mmm-hmm.

10:17.453 --> 10:19.648
You're giving up being a detective?
Mmm-hmm.

10:19.721 --> 10:23.020
And any chance you'll
ever have of being reinstated?

10:24.860 --> 10:28.352
Adrian. We haven't known
each other very long.

10:28.430 --> 10:30.421
But I'm a pretty good
judge of character.

10:30.499 --> 10:33.730
And I know one thing for sure.
You're no quitter.

10:33.802 --> 10:36.862
Then, how do you
explain this? I quit.

10:38.307 --> 10:41.538
Well, what would you do?
How would you pay the rent?

10:41.610 --> 10:42.941
Welfare.

10:43.011 --> 10:45.571
Welfare. That's your plan?

10:45.647 --> 10:47.638
What about Natalie?
She's been depending on you.

10:47.716 --> 10:49.684
What would she do?
Welfare.

10:49.751 --> 10:51.878
We can be welfare buddies.

10:51.954 --> 10:55.446
Adrian. Quitting is a terrible habit.
It's like a drug.

10:55.524 --> 10:58.254
Once you start, it's almost
impossible to stop.

10:58.327 --> 11:01.353
Besides, I'm not even sure
you're eligible for welfare.

11:01.430 --> 11:03.694
You have to meet
certain criteria. You...

11:03.765 --> 11:05.733
Do I have to run a half
a mile in four minutes?

11:05.801 --> 11:07.962
No.
Then, I'll be fine.

11:15.878 --> 11:19.507
There you go.
Hey. That's a nice mug.

11:19.581 --> 11:22.846
Yeah. It was from my daughter.
But that mug is a lie.

11:22.918 --> 11:25.546
I wasn't the
world's greatest dad.

11:25.621 --> 11:27.919
She was the world's greatest
daughter, you know?

11:27.990 --> 11:31.983
Rebecca. She died
five years ago.

11:32.060 --> 11:34.961
Oh. I'm sorry.
Yeah. Well, life goes on.

11:35.030 --> 11:36.930
And on. And on.

11:38.333 --> 11:41.791
Hey. Where's your lady friend?
She's picking up her kid.

11:41.870 --> 11:44.566
Mr. Flynn?
Have you ever seen this man?

11:46.008 --> 11:48.499
Mmm-mmm. No.

11:48.577 --> 11:53.139
We found some DNA.
Charles Bach. Bach?

11:53.215 --> 11:54.876
They call him "The Iceman."

11:54.950 --> 11:57.248
That doesn't sound good.
- Actually, it suits him.

11:57.319 --> 11:59.048
He's a professional hit man.

11:59.121 --> 12:01.316
The FBI thinks he's
killed 14 people.

12:01.390 --> 12:03.881
It means that somebody
with some very deep pockets

12:03.959 --> 12:05.824
has put a contract
out on your boy.

12:05.894 --> 12:08.021
Now, you said you and Ray
don't have any enemies.

12:08.096 --> 12:09.529
Do you want to
amend that statement?

12:09.598 --> 12:10.724
No.

12:11.900 --> 12:12.889
No.

12:14.002 --> 12:16.402
You know the Marino family,
Mr. Flynn? Frankie Marino?

12:16.471 --> 12:17.802
Yeah. Just from
the newspapers.

12:17.873 --> 12:20.501
Well, The Iceman
used to work for him.

12:20.909 --> 12:23.605
You don't happen to owe Frank
Marino or anybody on his crew

12:23.679 --> 12:25.112
any money, by any chance?

12:25.180 --> 12:29.173
Hell, no. We are clean.
Ray is the clean machine.

12:30.218 --> 12:31.810
You might want to think
about that, Lou.

12:31.887 --> 12:35.983
Because this guy is not going
to stop. He's a machine, too.

12:36.058 --> 12:37.082
We think he's going
to try again.

12:37.159 --> 12:38.251
We're thinking Friday night.

12:38.327 --> 12:39.760
You mean during the fight?

12:39.828 --> 12:42.194
It would make sense.
We cannot protect him in the ring.

12:42.264 --> 12:44.755
Are you telling me to
cancel the fight?

12:44.833 --> 12:46.095
Forget about it!

12:46.168 --> 12:49.569
We've been fighting five years
for another shot at the title!

12:49.638 --> 12:53.096
Ray is doing his job! Why
the hell can't you do yours?

12:54.910 --> 12:57.674
Monk, do you have anything?
No, I'm good.

12:58.614 --> 13:01.014
What's this? Jesus.

13:02.150 --> 13:04.448
Come here a minute.
Come here.

13:04.519 --> 13:08.046
We just have a couple more
questions, Mr. Flynn.

13:08.123 --> 13:09.385
Over here.
Okay.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.254
What is this?
Application.

13:15.497 --> 13:17.192
Monk, you're not going
on welfare.

13:17.265 --> 13:19.358
If you go on welfare,
I will shoot you.

13:19.434 --> 13:21.561
Good. I'll get more money,
won't I?

13:21.637 --> 13:24.697
Why? Because you're out of
breath? Your knees ache?

13:27.609 --> 13:29.509
So, that's it, huh?
After all these years,

13:29.578 --> 13:32.342
you're just going to
walk away. Give up.

13:33.915 --> 13:35.678
What would Trudy say?

13:36.218 --> 13:38.345
No, let me rephrase that.

13:39.755 --> 13:41.450
What is Trudy saying?

14:13.488 --> 14:17.151
When I'm in the ring,
people expect me to sweat.

14:17.225 --> 14:20.820
But here at home,
I'm supposed to be cool.

14:20.896 --> 14:22.625
And sophisticated.

14:24.933 --> 14:26.491
Thank you, Hobbes.

14:27.436 --> 14:29.927
So, I use Max Deodorant.

14:30.005 --> 14:32.735
To give B.O. The K.O.

14:35.143 --> 14:38.704
It's still a little garbled.
Let's try the last line again.

14:41.249 --> 14:43.911
So, I use Max Deodorant

14:43.985 --> 14:47.580
to K.O. All my B.O.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:49.357 --> 14:51.154
I'm not used to
all these words.

14:51.226 --> 14:53.660
Usually, I let my hands
do the talking.

14:54.463 --> 14:56.328
Mr. M.
What you doing here?

14:56.398 --> 14:59.026
Ray, we have to talk.
He's a little busy right now.

14:59.101 --> 15:01.661
This spot has to be on the
air by September first.

15:01.737 --> 15:03.170
This is all Louie's idea.

15:03.238 --> 15:05.035
He said we should cash
in now while we can.

15:05.107 --> 15:08.474
Yeah. It's important.
Can you give us a minute?

15:08.543 --> 15:11.910
Okay. Fine. I guess we
need a break, anyway.

15:11.980 --> 15:13.345
Who are... What's going on?

15:13.415 --> 15:15.781
Hey. Hey. I can't believe
you're watching this again.

15:15.851 --> 15:17.079
Who are you?
Who are you people?

15:17.152 --> 15:19.279
This is a busted take.
We kept the camera rolling.

15:19.354 --> 15:20.787
Who's that guy?

15:20.856 --> 15:22.721
He owns the house.
That's his old lady.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.349
She forgot to tell him we were
going to shoot there,

15:24.426 --> 15:26.053
and he came home
and went postal.

15:26.128 --> 15:28.255
Kept shouting,
threatening everybody.

15:28.330 --> 15:30.161
I wouldn't want to go
12 rounds with that dude.

15:30.232 --> 15:33.690
Okay. Playtime's over.

15:33.769 --> 15:35.293
We'll be back in 10.

15:42.310 --> 15:43.834
What's this?

15:46.414 --> 15:51.010
You threw the fight, Ray.
Five years ago. The title fight.

15:52.654 --> 15:54.713
Come on, man. You hear
stories all the time.

15:54.790 --> 15:57.759
I had Natalie's daughter
do some research for me

15:57.826 --> 16:00.226
on the worldwide Internet
computer web.

16:00.295 --> 16:02.923
Don't worry. I didn't tell
her what it was for.

16:03.665 --> 16:07.601
See? There's Louie Flynn.
See?

16:07.669 --> 16:11.935
There he is again.
He's always wearing the same cross.

16:12.007 --> 16:14.237
Okay. His mother
gave him that cross.

16:14.309 --> 16:15.367
She said it was
blessed by the Pope.

16:15.443 --> 16:16.933
He has a habit.

16:17.913 --> 16:21.974
He tucks it under his shirt
whenever he's lying.

16:22.050 --> 16:25.076
Here's the title fight.
You see? He's tucked it away.

16:25.153 --> 16:27.178
Like he's ashamed of himself.

16:27.255 --> 16:29.917
That doesn't prove
anything. Does it?

16:29.991 --> 16:32.221
No. No.

16:33.295 --> 16:37.061
But this does. This is from
what they call a website.

16:37.132 --> 16:39.828
It's from a Swiss
medical journal.

16:39.901 --> 16:41.960
Right after the title fight,
Louie's daughter

16:42.037 --> 16:44.335
flew to Geneva
to have a series

16:44.406 --> 16:47.239
of experimental operations.

16:47.809 --> 16:49.868
It cost over two
million dollars.

16:50.812 --> 16:54.043
So, where did he get
all that money, Ray?

16:54.516 --> 16:57.485
Because your share of the
purse wouldn't have covered it.

17:01.556 --> 17:04.491
You and Louie bet
against yourself.

17:04.559 --> 17:06.617
And then,
you threw the fight.

17:09.030 --> 17:10.019
Right?

17:12.901 --> 17:14.596
She was dying.

17:15.936 --> 17:19.464
This was her only chance.
She was so young.

17:30.752 --> 17:34.916
The mob must have lost
a fortune on that fight.

17:34.990 --> 17:37.288
If I could figure this out,

17:37.359 --> 17:39.759
it's possible that
they did, too.

17:39.828 --> 17:41.318
And that's why they
tried to kill you.

17:41.396 --> 17:43.023
This is all my fault.

17:44.366 --> 17:45.833
What happened to Eddie.

17:46.902 --> 17:49.029
I was just hoping...

17:49.104 --> 17:51.163
This Friday, if I won...

17:52.841 --> 17:54.536
That I'd prove something...

17:55.844 --> 17:57.539
At least, to myself.

18:00.715 --> 18:02.683
They won't let me
fight now, right?

18:04.119 --> 18:05.552
So, my life is over.
Maybe not.

18:05.620 --> 18:09.249
I still haven't told anyone about this.
Not even Natalie.

18:10.292 --> 18:11.350
Why not?

18:11.426 --> 18:13.553
I thought about it.

18:13.628 --> 18:15.118
You've been punishing yourself
for five years.

18:15.196 --> 18:17.391
Maybe that's
punishment enough.

18:18.833 --> 18:21.358
Thank you, Mr. Monk.
You're like an angel.

18:21.436 --> 18:22.460
Oh, yeah.

18:22.537 --> 18:25.062
If there's anything
I can do for you...

18:25.140 --> 18:27.301
Well, now that
you mention it...

18:27.375 --> 18:29.104
There is something.

18:30.078 --> 18:32.706
Don't tell me to relax. He's
supposed to be dead by now.

18:32.781 --> 18:34.578
He is dead.
He just doesn't know it.

18:34.649 --> 18:37.743
Do you understand the
clock is ticking on this?

18:37.819 --> 18:41.949
I told you it's under control.
He won't finish the fight.

18:42.023 --> 18:43.923
Just make sure my
money is ready.

18:58.940 --> 19:03.343
What? Hello? Let's go,
Mr. Monk! It's time!

19:06.181 --> 19:07.375
Ray?

19:09.117 --> 19:11.142
Are you all right?
You wanted my help, remember?

19:11.219 --> 19:14.416
Quid pro quo!
Quid what, what, what?

19:14.489 --> 19:16.889
Pro quo! I owe you, brother!

19:16.958 --> 19:19.017
You gave me a second chance.
Now, I'm giving you one.

19:19.094 --> 19:20.789
You're going to pass
that physical next week.

19:20.862 --> 19:22.090
I guarantee it.

19:22.163 --> 19:24.324
No. No, I didn't mean.

19:24.399 --> 19:27.630
Here's the thing. This is
my first quid pro quo.

19:27.702 --> 19:29.602
I didn't know they
started this early.

19:29.671 --> 19:31.696
Oh, it ain't early.
It's 5:00 a.m.

19:31.773 --> 19:34.435
I took the whole day off. Told
Louie I had to clear my head.

19:34.509 --> 19:36.477
You know, after everything
that's happened.

19:36.544 --> 19:38.307
Drink up.
What is it?

19:38.380 --> 19:40.473
Don't ask.
Okay, but what is it?

19:40.548 --> 19:43.142
It's called "Go Juice." Louie
invented it 20 years ago.

19:43.218 --> 19:45.584
It's got every juice and herb you
can think of, all mixed together.

19:45.653 --> 19:46.779
It makes you go.

19:46.855 --> 19:49.551
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

19:49.624 --> 19:51.148
You're giving me
a laxative?

19:51.493 --> 19:55.623
When I say go,
I mean like the wind.

19:55.697 --> 19:57.130
Like the beast you were.

19:57.198 --> 20:00.258
And will be again.
You are a beast. What are you?

20:01.870 --> 20:03.531
A beast.
What are you?

20:03.605 --> 20:06.005
I'm a beast.
Let's do this!

20:09.778 --> 20:11.109
Take it. Yeah.

20:13.014 --> 20:16.108
Oh, yeah.
Hurts so good.

20:16.184 --> 20:18.744
That's it. That's it.
Like a beast.

20:38.673 --> 20:41.301
Bounce. Come up.
Do some clapping.

20:41.376 --> 20:43.435
Like that.

20:43.511 --> 20:47.003
Get up there. That's it right
there. Pick it up. All right.

20:47.082 --> 20:50.609
That's it. Go. Nice. Nice.
You're doing great.

20:50.685 --> 20:56.453
That's it. Get it down.
There you go. One more.

20:58.827 --> 21:00.727
Oh, yeah.

21:02.130 --> 21:07.466
There you go, Mr. M.
There you go. Come on. Come on.

21:07.535 --> 21:09.332
Where you at?
Where you at?

21:41.603 --> 21:46.472
There you go.
That's it. That's it.

21:47.442 --> 21:50.002
Look at your balance.

21:50.078 --> 21:52.546
I've got you. We've got you.
We've got you.

21:52.614 --> 21:56.846
Knees up. Knees up.
Just bring it up.

22:03.424 --> 22:05.551
Do it! Let me see you work!
Let me see the beast!

22:05.627 --> 22:07.254
The beast is in you!
Faster!

22:07.328 --> 22:08.818
Faster, Monk!
Come on, now!

22:08.897 --> 22:10.592
I know you've got it!
You've got to dig deep!

22:10.665 --> 22:12.428
Do you want it?
Do you want it?

22:12.500 --> 22:13.626
Hey! Do you want it?
Yeah.

22:13.701 --> 22:15.066
Let me see that beast.
There he is.

22:15.136 --> 22:16.194
Let me see you work. Yeah!

22:16.271 --> 22:17.829
Looking good!
The beast is in you!

22:17.906 --> 22:19.567
Let me see that beast!
Where's the beast?

22:19.641 --> 22:22.132
Come on! Is that the beast
face? Look at the beast face.

22:22.210 --> 22:24.371
Oh, you are a bad man!
You're a bad man!

22:31.920 --> 22:34.411
Hello. I'm looking
for Frankie.

22:34.489 --> 22:35.956
Who are you?

22:36.024 --> 22:40.791
Johnny. It's okay.
The Captain and I are old friends.

22:40.862 --> 22:44.923
"Friends" is a funny word.
I'm looking for Charles Bach.

22:44.999 --> 22:46.933
Bach?
The Iceman?

22:47.001 --> 22:49.595
He's been on your
payroll for 10 years?

22:49.671 --> 22:52.139
You wearing a
wire, Lieutenant?

23:16.998 --> 23:19.023
How about you?
No.

23:19.100 --> 23:21.159
Okay. Let's talk.

23:21.236 --> 23:23.227
Why did I just get undressed?
I don't know, Randy.

23:23.304 --> 23:25.397
Everybody in the room is
wondering the same thing.

23:25.473 --> 23:27.304
I haven't seen Charles
in three years.

23:27.375 --> 23:31.209
Not since my trial.
I heard he went freelance.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.509
Is this about the
fireworks at Lou's gym?

23:33.581 --> 23:36.516
That's right.
There's a contract out on Ray Regis.

23:36.584 --> 23:39.451
There was a lot of money in
play the last time he fought.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.714
Some of it yours.

23:40.788 --> 23:42.779
Frankie, you've been
known to hold a grudge.

23:42.857 --> 23:44.119
Not this time.

23:44.192 --> 23:46.820
There was some talk on the
street the fight might end...

23:46.894 --> 23:48.327
Prematurely.

23:48.396 --> 23:51.160
We moved some money around.
Adjusted the odds.

23:51.232 --> 23:54.224
It was actually one of the
biggest paydays we ever had.

23:54.302 --> 23:55.701
I got no beef
with Ray Regis.

23:55.770 --> 23:58.238
I am trying to save
the kid's life.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.297
I don't know very much.

24:02.543 --> 24:04.738
Somebody was shopping
a contract.

24:04.812 --> 24:07.406
I don't know who,
but it was serious.

24:07.482 --> 24:10.679
He wanted it done
by the end of the month.

24:10.752 --> 24:12.083
By the end of the month?

24:12.153 --> 24:14.121
The fight's on Friday.
That's the 25th.

24:14.188 --> 24:15.587
Why by the end of the month?

24:15.657 --> 24:17.557
Weird, huh?
Yeah. Weird.

24:18.226 --> 24:19.693
Very weird.

24:20.728 --> 24:22.320
Get dressed, Randy.

24:42.016 --> 24:44.484
Yeah! How did I do?
You finished.

24:44.552 --> 24:46.679
That was the main thing.
You ran that whole half-mile.

24:46.754 --> 24:48.949
Yeah, but...
How long? How long?

24:49.023 --> 24:51.287
It was just a test run.
It don't really count.

24:51.359 --> 24:53.850
Because it felt like
five minutes. Maybe...

24:53.928 --> 24:56.362
Maybe six.
Between five and six.

24:56.431 --> 25:00.265
Twenty-seven minutes? That's
not possible. It's not...

25:00.335 --> 25:02.326
This thing is broken.
Well, you kept rearranging the

25:02.403 --> 25:03.529
hurdles and touching
everything.

25:03.604 --> 25:05.572
That stuff adds up.

25:06.307 --> 25:07.797
I'll never do it...
Hey!

25:07.875 --> 25:11.106
Never say never.
Never say never.

25:11.179 --> 25:13.204
That's the worst swear
word there is.

25:13.281 --> 25:15.340
You can do it
and you will do it.

25:15.416 --> 25:17.145
The beast is in you.

25:17.218 --> 25:19.846
You'll do it when you have to do it.
When it's crunch time,

25:19.921 --> 25:21.752
you will reach down...

25:21.823 --> 25:24.053
Deep down
and you will find it.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.922
You're going to find it.

25:27.795 --> 25:29.922
And hopefully, I will, too.

25:41.809 --> 25:43.299
Concorde Suite.

25:53.721 --> 25:56.815
Hello, boxing fans,
and welcome to the main event.

25:56.891 --> 25:59.485
Five years in the making.
Ray "The Machine" Regis

25:59.560 --> 26:02.358
looks to settle the score in
a rematch with the champion.

26:02.430 --> 26:06.230
Carlos Geraldo. It's all
on the line tonight.

26:09.771 --> 26:12.433
Mr. Monk, are you okay?
Oh, no.

26:12.507 --> 26:13.633
This guy is a
contract killer.

26:13.708 --> 26:15.039
We think he might already
be in the building.

26:15.109 --> 26:17.407
He's here because somebody
wants Ray Regis

26:17.478 --> 26:19.241
dead by the end
of the month.

26:19.313 --> 26:21.042
The end of the month?

26:21.115 --> 26:22.639
Why, why not tonight?

26:22.717 --> 26:24.184
I asked myself
the same question.

26:24.252 --> 26:26.117
I'm just telling you
what I know.

26:26.187 --> 26:28.121
Keep your eyes open.
If you see him,

26:28.189 --> 26:30.555
if you think you see him,
do not be a cowboy,

26:30.625 --> 26:34.026
call it in. This guy is a pro.
He's not going easily.

26:34.095 --> 26:35.585
Let's go.
Let's do it.

26:41.302 --> 26:44.032
Hey, Bobby. Take a break,
will you?

26:51.846 --> 26:53.609
How you doing?
I'm hungry.

26:53.681 --> 26:55.581
Hungry, huh?
Yeah.

26:55.650 --> 26:58.141
Good. You stay hungry.

27:00.421 --> 27:02.082
So...

27:02.657 --> 27:04.454
We both know you should have
come away with that belt

27:04.525 --> 27:06.493
five years ago, right?

27:06.561 --> 27:10.793
But, what you did.
I mean...

27:10.865 --> 27:13.732
What we did, we did it
for Rebecca.

27:17.371 --> 27:20.101
And now,
it's your turn, baby.

27:20.174 --> 27:22.267
You are a champion.

27:22.343 --> 27:25.506
You've always been a champion.

27:27.949 --> 27:29.780
And after tonight...

27:30.618 --> 27:32.779
Everybody's going to know it.

27:35.122 --> 27:38.148
Excuse me. Mr. Regis?
This is Officer Chambers.

27:38.226 --> 27:40.126
The police want somebody
with you during the fight.

27:40.194 --> 27:43.357
No way. I don't know this guy.
Forget it.

27:43.431 --> 27:45.331
I'm sorry, but you can't
go out there alone.

27:45.399 --> 27:47.196
Captain Stottlemeyer's
orders.

27:51.305 --> 27:54.274
Hello? Yeah.
He's right here.

27:56.577 --> 27:58.442
It's Ray Regis.

27:59.180 --> 28:00.477
Hello?

28:00.748 --> 28:02.443
Uh-huh.

28:03.985 --> 28:05.509
I understand.

28:06.053 --> 28:09.352
Absolutely.
I'll be right there.

28:13.227 --> 28:14.922
What's a corner man?

28:17.698 --> 28:19.598
Ladies and gentlemen.

28:19.667 --> 28:22.761
Welcome to the rematch
you've been waiting for!

28:22.837 --> 28:27.001
Twelve rounds for the
greatest title in sports!

28:27.074 --> 28:30.532
The B.F.C. World Championship!

28:31.779 --> 28:36.443
In the red corner,
at 210 pounds,

28:36.517 --> 28:39.884
the undisputed world
heavyweight champion,

28:39.954 --> 28:43.788
the Duke of Destruction.

28:43.858 --> 28:47.885
Carlos Geraldo!

28:48.896 --> 28:50.363
And here
comes the champ.

28:50.431 --> 28:51.523
You know, talking
to his trainers,

28:51.599 --> 28:53.624
they say he's in the best
shape of his career.

28:53.701 --> 28:56.898
And boy, I'd have to agree.
He looks terrific.

28:56.971 --> 28:58.871
He's added a few pounds
since the first fight,

28:58.940 --> 29:00.134
but that's intentional.

29:00.207 --> 29:02.675
He might be heavier,
but he's stronger.

29:04.312 --> 29:08.180
And in the blue corner,
at 202 pounds,

29:08.249 --> 29:11.480
San Francisco's own
favorite son,

29:11.552 --> 29:16.251
Ray "The Machine" Regis!

29:20.027 --> 29:22.154
And just listen
to that reception.

29:22.229 --> 29:24.197
Oh, there's so much
love for Ray Regis

29:24.265 --> 29:25.493
here in the Bay Area.

29:25.566 --> 29:28.262
Just go to a local watering
hole. Go to a local gym.

29:28.336 --> 29:30.702
Talk to the people,
and they'll tell you

29:30.771 --> 29:33.569
Ray has lost
absolutely nothing.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.939
Now, these fans have been
waiting five years for

29:36.010 --> 29:38.740
this moment. But there's a lot
of questions about Ray Regis.

29:38.813 --> 29:40.678
That he's lost
his mental edge.

29:40.748 --> 29:43.216
That he was psychologically
broken by his defeat.

29:43.284 --> 29:45.275
That he'll never be the same.

29:45.353 --> 29:48.220
But all these questions will
be answered tonight

29:48.289 --> 29:52.282
in the ring in this highly
anticipated rematch.

29:54.695 --> 29:56.253
Check this guy out!

29:57.031 --> 30:00.125
A slight delay now,
as one of Regis' corner men

30:00.201 --> 30:02.999
seems to be tangled up.

30:05.873 --> 30:08.808
Come on, man!

30:19.487 --> 30:21.387
Gentlemen? I want
you to touch gloves,

30:21.455 --> 30:23.753
and let's have a
good, clean fight.

30:27.294 --> 30:30.058
Okay. Okay. Punch him hard!

30:30.131 --> 30:32.156
Punch him fast!
Just keep punching.

30:32.233 --> 30:35.600
Okay. He knows. He knows.
He knows about punching.

30:37.705 --> 30:39.900
What the hell are you doing?
Leave him alone.

30:39.974 --> 30:41.134
Leave him alone.

30:41.208 --> 30:42.505
There's
the bell for round one.

30:42.576 --> 30:44.203
Regis comes out fast.

30:44.278 --> 30:46.769
A hard left hand from Geraldo.

30:46.847 --> 30:49.509
Another left jab. Oh, the
champion is toying with him.

30:49.583 --> 30:51.517
Just taunting him.
- That's it.

30:51.585 --> 30:52.779
There's more than
a heavyweight title

30:52.853 --> 30:53.945
on the line tonight.

30:54.021 --> 30:56.353
There's the pride of
two great fighters.

30:56.424 --> 30:58.289
Regis, the former champion.

30:58.359 --> 31:00.884
Geraldo,
the reigning champion.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.095
A good start to this
much anticipated fight.

31:08.169 --> 31:10.933
Both fighters feeling their
way, sizing each other up.

31:11.005 --> 31:14.168
Now, they're tangled up.
The referee needs to get in there.

31:14.241 --> 31:15.572
Break. Break.

31:15.643 --> 31:17.770
There you go.
Ray Regis will not last long

31:17.845 --> 31:20.075
if he allows Geraldo to
pound his body that way.

31:20.147 --> 31:23.639
Help him. Do something.
Do something? What the hell?

31:23.718 --> 31:26.414
Both of these fighters
are clearly in top shape.

31:37.131 --> 31:39.156
Geraldo showing why
he's the champion.

31:39.233 --> 31:41.064
He's really got
something to prove.

31:41.135 --> 31:42.693
And there's the bell.

31:45.740 --> 31:48.004
All right. Go for the ribs.

31:48.075 --> 31:49.303
Don't let that
bastard breathe.

31:49.376 --> 31:52.072
Go for the combination. Left,
right, left. Left, right.

31:52.146 --> 31:53.579
You got that, baby.
You got it.

31:53.647 --> 31:54.944
Or try this. Try this.
You're gonna win it, baby.

31:55.015 --> 31:56.915
Left, left. Right, right.
Huh? Huh?

31:56.984 --> 31:58.144
Left, left.
Don't listen to him!

31:58.219 --> 31:59.311
Hit him with both
hands at the same time.

31:59.386 --> 32:04.085
This is Round Two
and here comes Regis.

32:04.158 --> 32:06.023
Ray in there early,
working that left jab.

32:14.335 --> 32:16.667
Regis still working
that left hand.

32:16.737 --> 32:18.796
And he needs to.
He's got to keep the champ

32:18.873 --> 32:20.807
away from his body.

32:38.459 --> 32:41.428
All right, baby. All right.

32:41.495 --> 32:44.191
It's time to cold cock this baby, huh?
Put his lights out.

32:44.265 --> 32:46.790
Put him to sleep. All right,
baby? You've got him.

32:46.867 --> 32:49.062
Gotcha.
You've got him by the...

32:49.136 --> 32:51.001
What the hell are you doing?
Hold on. They're not even.

32:51.071 --> 32:52.834
Are you out of your
cotton-picking mind?

32:52.907 --> 32:54.568
Get out of here!
Okay, Coach.

32:54.642 --> 32:57.110
Back out for another round,
and Geraldo is in control.

32:57.178 --> 32:59.578
But this should be a
big one for Ray Regis.

32:59.647 --> 33:02.445
Ah, Regis scores with
a nice combination.

33:03.017 --> 33:04.507
Mr. Monk!
You can't do that!

33:04.585 --> 33:06.177
You can't be in there.
Get back!

33:06.253 --> 33:08.084
One of Regis'
corner men is in the ring.

33:08.155 --> 33:09.213
What's going
on over here?

33:12.660 --> 33:14.423
What's going on here?

33:16.297 --> 33:17.423
Sir? Get back.

33:17.498 --> 33:18.829
Well, the ref
is stopping the action.

33:18.899 --> 33:20.332
And Regis better be careful.

33:20.401 --> 33:22.926
He doesn't want to get
disqualified at this point.

33:27.842 --> 33:29.104
Again,
they're tied up.

33:29.176 --> 33:30.905
Knock him on his butt!

33:32.446 --> 33:35.506
And Geraldo's
worked his way back inside.

33:35.583 --> 33:37.608
Oh. I think he stunned
the champion.

33:37.685 --> 33:38.743
That's right!

33:38.819 --> 33:41.788
Regis with the right hand
again! Another right!

33:42.823 --> 33:46.884
And a flurry from Ray Regis
as the round ends!

33:49.897 --> 33:51.888
Is he okay?
He's sweating like a pig.

33:51.966 --> 33:54.196
He's supposed to sweat.

33:56.036 --> 33:58.231
Now, what the hell
are you doing?

33:59.473 --> 34:01.134
Stay here. Stay here.

34:01.809 --> 34:03.640
Stay here?
Natalie.

34:03.711 --> 34:06.145
Do you have any deodorant?
Deodorant?

34:06.213 --> 34:08.078
For Regis.
It's perspiration problems.

34:08.148 --> 34:09.614
No, Mr. Monk. Who cares?

34:09.683 --> 34:11.674
Hurry up. Just get...
Hurry up!

34:11.752 --> 34:13.219
The bell's about to ring.

34:13.286 --> 34:14.447
Connie? They want us upstairs.

34:14.521 --> 34:17.284
Skybox Number Five
didn't get their food.

34:18.559 --> 34:19.958
Here.

34:20.327 --> 34:21.817
Natalie.
Here!

34:22.295 --> 34:24.025
What?
There.

34:25.699 --> 34:28.190
Oh, my God.
We have to stop the fight.

34:28.268 --> 34:29.964
No, no, no. We don't want to
give them a stationary target.

34:30.036 --> 34:32.437
Call the Captain!
Oh, my God!

35:31.565 --> 35:34.432
Oh, a solid combination.
And a couple of jabs!

35:34.501 --> 35:36.992
Ray Regis will not back down!

36:10.704 --> 36:13.195
Geraldo taking a lot
of punishment now.

36:13.273 --> 36:15.366
And the crowd loves it!

36:15.442 --> 36:18.536
Ray Regis has answered
the critics tonight.

36:41.201 --> 36:43.829
Now, to the body! Oh!
Geraldo is hurt!

36:43.904 --> 36:46.099
Geraldo's in trouble, folks!

36:47.474 --> 36:50.602
Oh, another stinging jab!
And a big right hand!

36:53.047 --> 36:55.777
Oh, Regis showing that
he hasn't lost a thing.

36:55.849 --> 36:58.750
Geraldo's hands, on the
other hand, are sagging.

37:07.995 --> 37:10.828
Oh, you can see the concern
in Geraldo's corner.

37:10.898 --> 37:13.264
Geraldo taking a
lot of punishment.

37:13.333 --> 37:15.233
And the crowd loves it!

37:15.803 --> 37:17.964
Regis with a right hand
again and again!

37:18.038 --> 37:20.233
All of Geraldo must be
praying for the bell to ring.

37:20.307 --> 37:21.501
Regis wants a knockout,

37:21.575 --> 37:23.600
but I don't think
there's enough time.

37:23.677 --> 37:25.008
You got him, kid!

37:25.079 --> 37:29.880
Oh, look out! Geraldo goes
down! Geraldo goes down!

37:29.950 --> 37:32.248
Listen to this crowd!

37:43.130 --> 37:44.154
The winner.

37:44.364 --> 37:45.626
Drop it!

37:51.839 --> 37:53.773
Congratulations, Ray Regis,

37:53.841 --> 37:55.638
the world heavyweight
champion!

37:55.709 --> 37:58.644
They'll be celebrating
in the Bay Area tonight.

37:58.879 --> 38:00.540
Okay, thanks.

38:05.652 --> 38:06.880
What?
What?

38:06.954 --> 38:08.012
You got up here so fast.

38:08.088 --> 38:09.453
You got up here in,
like, 90 seconds.

38:09.523 --> 38:12.117
That's impossible.
Oh, my God.

38:12.192 --> 38:14.490
Do you still need this?
Oh, God.

38:22.836 --> 38:24.428
It was him or us.

38:26.306 --> 38:29.639
The sad thing is that we'll
never know who hired him.

38:38.152 --> 38:40.677
So, I use Max Deodorant.

38:40.754 --> 38:42.221
It's stolen art.

38:42.289 --> 38:43.483
There's a rumor some
guy in the city's

38:43.557 --> 38:44.546
been buying it all up.

38:44.625 --> 38:47.355
We're supposed to keep
an eye out for it.

38:47.427 --> 38:49.861
Everyone, get out!
Are you filming this?

38:49.930 --> 38:51.261
Come on! Get...
Get out of here!

38:51.331 --> 38:53.231
What... What are you...
Turn that thing off right now!

38:53.300 --> 38:55.291
And get the hell
out of my house!

38:55.369 --> 38:57.963
This spot has to be on the
air by September first.

38:58.038 --> 38:59.505
He is here because
somebody wants

38:59.573 --> 39:02.701
Ray Regis dead by
the end of the month.

39:02.776 --> 39:04.869
We got him.
We got who?

39:04.945 --> 39:07.004
The guy who wanted
Regis dead.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.878
Remember the art gallery
you had on your wall?

39:09.950 --> 39:11.349
Yeah.

39:12.386 --> 39:15.150
They're authentic.
One was stolen nine years ago

39:15.222 --> 39:16.519
from a gallery in Madrid.

39:16.590 --> 39:19.184
And two are from
a museum in Venice.

39:19.259 --> 39:20.624
He was worried that
somebody would

39:20.694 --> 39:23.162
see the artwork on
TV and recognize it.

39:23.230 --> 39:24.697
But he knew that if
Ray Regis were dead,

39:24.765 --> 39:26.164
they would never
run the ad.

39:26.233 --> 39:29.031
So, he hired that
terrible, terrible man.

39:29.670 --> 39:33.265
Hey. Nice collection, Daniel.
Too bad none of it's yours.

39:33.340 --> 39:34.932
Should have just kept
it all in the basement.

39:35.008 --> 39:38.136
It's fine art, Lieutenant.
It's meant to be savored.

39:38.212 --> 39:40.043
I never imagined
my bride would invite

39:40.113 --> 39:41.205
a TV crew into my house

39:41.281 --> 39:42.339
while I was out of
the country.

39:42.416 --> 39:44.111
So, you didn't tell
her it was stolen.

39:44.184 --> 39:45.481
In hindsight, maybe that's

39:45.552 --> 39:46.746
something I should
have mentioned.

39:46.820 --> 39:48.845
Yeah. Get him out of here.

39:51.992 --> 39:53.960
Well, the guy went through
a lot of trouble for nothing.

39:54.027 --> 39:55.927
I mean, nobody even watches
commercials anymore.

39:55.996 --> 39:58.021
Is that right?
It's called TiVo, Mr. Monk.

39:58.098 --> 40:00.828
People just zap right past it
to get to the good stuff.

40:00.901 --> 40:02.596
That makes sense.

40:10.544 --> 40:14.947
Oh, hey! Oh, yeah!
All right! Boom!

40:15.415 --> 40:18.213
All right!
Hang on.

40:18.285 --> 40:21.186
Hey. What are you doing?
Taking a break?

40:21.255 --> 40:22.779
You think winning that
championship belt means

40:22.856 --> 40:24.016
you can slack off, huh?

40:24.091 --> 40:25.991
Winning the gold belt
was the easy part.

40:26.059 --> 40:27.356
Keeping it is what's hard.

40:27.427 --> 40:29.895
Yeah, okay.
I love you, too, Louie.

40:31.498 --> 40:33.989
Uh-oh. Mr. M.
How did it go?

40:34.067 --> 40:35.796
Ah. Was there ever
any doubt?

40:35.869 --> 40:37.962
I am the beast.
I am the beast.

40:38.038 --> 40:40.233
He did everything. The wall,
the pull-ups, the run.

40:40.307 --> 40:41.296
All under seven minutes.

40:41.375 --> 40:43.707
And that includes touching
three mailboxes!

40:43.777 --> 40:47.713
I am the champion of the world.
I am the roi du monde.

40:47.781 --> 40:49.715
Looks like you've got some
competition, Ray.

40:49.783 --> 40:51.011
Absolutely.
I see.

40:51.084 --> 40:53.075
Absolutely. You may have met
your match, Machine.

40:53.153 --> 40:54.620
Uh-oh.
Come on. Let's do this.

40:54.688 --> 40:55.712
Because I ain't afraid of you.

40:55.789 --> 40:56.949
Yeah, yeah, Mr. Monk.
You are afraid.

40:57.024 --> 40:59.049
You're afraid of everything!
Not today.

40:59.126 --> 41:01.754
Come on, champ. Let's see
what you're made of.

41:01.828 --> 41:03.420
Try and tag me.
I don't want to tag you.

41:03.497 --> 41:04.623
Why don't you let me
buy you a drink?

41:04.698 --> 41:06.029
A drink?
Yeah.

41:06.099 --> 41:07.589
A drink? I'll give you
a drink of this.

41:07.668 --> 41:09.499
Oh. Mr. Monk, please
Come on, man.

41:09.569 --> 41:11.469
Natalie.
Would you help me out?

41:13.573 --> 41:16.269
Oh, my God. Mr. Monk.
Are you okay?

41:16.343 --> 41:18.072
Don't worry. He's going
to be all right.

41:18.145 --> 41:20.579
Oh, Jesus. Let's get
him home. My car is outside.

41:20.647 --> 41:23.445
Come on, beast. Come on.
Come on, big man.

41:24.384 --> 41:26.113
I ain't afraid of you.
I know you're not.

41:26.186 --> 41:28.086
I the beast.
Yeah, yeah. You the beast.

41:28.155 --> 41:31.283
Watch your head, now.
Watch your head, beast
