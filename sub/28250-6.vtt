00:00.987 --> 00:02.879
Eight years ago, I was lead prosecutor

00:02.913 --> 00:04.833
on a murder trial
that divided the country.

00:06.107 --> 00:08.442
When the jury found
movie star Sevvy Johnson

00:08.476 --> 00:10.611
not guilty of double homicid,

00:10.645 --> 00:11.812
I was devastated.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.547
You did everything you could, Maya.

00:13.581 --> 00:16.216
I left that life
and everyone in it behind.

00:16.251 --> 00:17.951
But then the unthinkable happened.

00:17.986 --> 00:18.785
He killed again.

00:18.820 --> 00:20.087
You have to come back, Maya.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.289
This time, we're gonna get him.

00:22.323 --> 00:23.624
I found this on the porch.

00:23.658 --> 00:25.492
There's no card. Secret admirer?

00:25.526 --> 00:27.261
Your stalker? He's back?

00:27.295 --> 00:28.495
A detective came by my place.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.297
They always want to talk to the ex.

00:30.331 --> 00:32.833
Maya Travis has you and Jessica on tape

00:32.867 --> 00:34.601
the night before she was murdered.

00:34.636 --> 00:36.637
There's a mole in this office.

00:36.671 --> 00:38.472
No one leaves this office
until we find out who it is.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.061
And everybody takes a lie-detector test.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.443
I know it's you.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.874
- We found the mole.
- Who?

00:44.908 --> 00:46.081
It was a janitor on the night shift.

00:46.116 --> 00:47.347
He's been fired.

00:47.382 --> 00:48.982
What was Sevvy's DNA doing on it?

00:49.017 --> 00:51.084
This is it. Sevvy was there.

00:51.119 --> 00:53.854
Matthew. We've got him!

00:53.888 --> 00:55.756
On a little getaway?

00:55.790 --> 00:57.658
Something like that.

01:02.330 --> 01:04.998
Sevvy Johnson. LAPD. We have
a warrant for your arrest.

01:05.033 --> 01:06.133
Open up. Mm-hmm.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.535
Did you check the guest quarters?

01:08.569 --> 01:10.671
- He's not at the Malibu house.
- Yes. Thank you.

01:10.705 --> 01:12.506
He's not at the desert estate either.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.441
Housekeeper
hasn't seen Sevvy since yesterday.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.610
Okay, so, he's not at
any of his residences.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.779
Let's check out his favorite
restaurants, hotels.

01:18.813 --> 01:21.368
He's got to be somewhere.
50 bucks says he ran.

01:21.402 --> 01:22.683
Let's not even go there.

01:22.717 --> 01:24.672
Just got a hit on Sevvy's car.

01:25.019 --> 01:26.716
He's at the Van Nuys Airport.

01:27.592 --> 01:29.122
Uh-huh.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.657
I'm gonna call Wolf.

01:30.692 --> 01:32.359
Ow, ah.

01:32.393 --> 01:34.494
Gentle, gentle, gentle. Oh.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.536
Maya. To what do I owe this pleasure?

01:42.570 --> 01:45.005
I have a warrant for
your client's arrest.

01:46.674 --> 01:48.542
- I see.
- But it appears he's fled.

01:48.576 --> 01:50.310
His car is at the Van Nuys Airport.

01:50.345 --> 01:53.213
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, innocent men don't run.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.849
I'm sure there's a perfectly
boring explanation for this.

01:55.883 --> 01:56.983
You know the drill, Wolf.

01:57.018 --> 01:59.686
Produce your client.
Yeah, now that you mention it,

01:59.721 --> 02:02.689
he did say he was planning
a sojourn up to Napa.

02:02.724 --> 02:04.591
Something about a-a wine tasting.

02:04.625 --> 02:07.627
Wherever he is, he's not on the run.

02:08.642 --> 02:10.910
The son of a bitch is on the run.

02:10.935 --> 02:12.402
More champagne?

02:14.969 --> 02:16.570
Thanks, Marie.

02:19.107 --> 02:20.674
Thank you.

02:57.812 --> 03:01.381
Thanks to the extraordinary
efforts of our prosecution team,

03:01.416 --> 03:02.783
we have charged Severen Johnson

03:02.817 --> 03:04.751
with the murder of Jessica Meyer.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.122
An arrest warrant has been
issued for Mr. Johnson.

03:09.157 --> 03:13.460
The Los Angeles D.A.'s office,
in conjunction with the LAPD,

03:13.494 --> 03:15.762
is actively searching for Mr. Johnson.

03:15.797 --> 03:17.764
We believe that he boarded
a private plane

03:17.799 --> 03:20.100
that left Van Nuys Airport
this afternoon.

03:20.134 --> 03:22.169
- Are you saying he fled?
- Why didn't you...

03:22.203 --> 03:24.337
- Did you let him get away?
- I can't comment

03:24.372 --> 03:26.573
on the specifics of
the ongoing investigation.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.175
What I can tell you is that

03:28.209 --> 03:30.444
we are presently obtaining flight plans.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.018
Mr. Johnson, if you're listening,

03:38.052 --> 03:39.853
turn yourself in.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.522
Running is only gonna make this worse.

03:42.557 --> 03:44.858
Wherever you are, we'll find you.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.832
Anyone assisting Mr. Johnson at this time

03:51.866 --> 03:53.366
may be considered an accessor.

03:53.401 --> 03:55.435
How long before we land?

03:55.470 --> 03:57.671
About 50 minutes.

03:57.705 --> 03:58.872
Um, once we land,

03:58.906 --> 04:01.675
how quickly can we refuel?
I can call ahead for the truck.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.677
- It should take about 45 minutes.
- That includes ground personnel,

04:03.711 --> 04:07.147
flight crews... anybody
agreeing to harbor Mr. Johnson.

04:07.181 --> 04:08.782
I-Is there any way
that we can do it faster?

04:08.816 --> 04:11.151
I can request two trucks,
one for each wing,

04:11.185 --> 04:12.686
but it'll be more expensive.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.654
Make it happen.

04:14.689 --> 04:15.822
The tip line's set up.

04:15.857 --> 04:18.558
We're monitoring social media
for any Sevvy sightings.

04:18.593 --> 04:21.228
CJ, find out everything we need
to know about private planes...

04:21.262 --> 04:23.129
how far they can fly
and how to track them.

04:23.164 --> 04:25.565
- Collier. My office.
- I'll call my ex-husband.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.765
He'll know. I thought he was a cop.

04:26.799 --> 04:29.436
And a weekend pilot.
Adrenaline junkie. Fun.

04:31.506 --> 04:32.539
Have a seat.

04:32.573 --> 04:35.475
If this is about us not
having a tail on Johnson,

04:35.510 --> 04:36.978
you know that's LAPD's job.

04:37.012 --> 04:39.813
No. I'm just curious... what
were you thinking last night

04:39.847 --> 04:41.848
hooking up the entire staff
to lie detectors?

04:41.883 --> 04:43.917
There was a mole in the office.
Why didn't you loop me in

04:43.951 --> 04:46.219
- before you put this place on lockdown?
- You were at a conference.

04:46.254 --> 04:48.889
It was a fluid situation. I handled it.

04:48.923 --> 04:51.525
Uh-huh. Real quick, whose
photo's hanging in the lobby?

04:52.627 --> 04:54.728
Yours. That's right.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.829
This is my house.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.997
You seem to keep forgetting that.

04:57.031 --> 04:59.366
Maybe that's because you were
appointed, not elected.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.101
I still have the power
to have you transferred

05:01.135 --> 05:03.169
to the hinterlands to handle
sprinkler violations

05:03.204 --> 05:04.704
if you keep overstepping.

05:04.739 --> 05:06.185
Alan, I cleaned up your house.

05:06.210 --> 05:07.874
I don't know what you
cleaned up, Matthew,

05:07.909 --> 05:09.743
'cause I haven't seen a report.
I'm working on it.

05:09.777 --> 05:11.845
With everything that's going on...
You're right.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.747
Manhunt trumps mole hunt.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.016
But as soon as Johnson's in custody,

05:16.050 --> 05:17.918
that report better be on my desk.

05:17.952 --> 05:19.052
Yes, sir.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.086
We're done.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.726
- Okay, thank you.
- No, this is great.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.562
Okay. Please tell Jordan
Mommy said good night,

05:28.596 --> 05:31.231
and pack an extra snack
for her field trip tomorrow.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.699
Thank you.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.601
So, if Sevvy is headed out of the country

05:34.635 --> 05:36.136
to a place without extradition,

05:36.170 --> 05:38.658
he will have to stop
on the East Coast to refuel.

05:38.692 --> 05:40.974
- That's where we'll grab him.
- What if he's already over the Atlantic?

05:41.008 --> 05:42.309
What if it's too late?

05:42.343 --> 05:43.877
Don't worry. It's gonna be okay.

05:43.911 --> 05:45.645
Sevvy is a famous guy.

05:45.680 --> 05:46.913
Someone will report him.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.418
Marie?

05:51.452 --> 05:53.954
Can I get a gin and tonic, please?

05:53.988 --> 05:55.989
Uh, make that a double.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.903
Answer your damn phone, Sevvy!

06:09.937 --> 06:12.606
If you are not lost in
the freaking Bermuda Triangle,

06:12.640 --> 06:14.908
I'm gonna rip your head off!

06:16.317 --> 06:18.612
Julianne, thank you.
Thank you for coming.

06:18.646 --> 06:20.413
- Where the hell is he?
- I don't know.

06:20.448 --> 06:22.616
You're paid to keep Sevvy out of trouble.

06:22.650 --> 06:25.018
- How'd you let this happen?
- You and I both know

06:25.052 --> 06:26.820
that man can't be controlled.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.856
You're the Sevvy Whisperer.
You know him better than anyone.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.524
Do you have any idea
where he could've gone?

06:31.559 --> 06:32.692
No. He dropped off Sunny,

06:32.727 --> 06:35.028
asked me to watch her for
the day. That's all I know.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.696
Okay.

06:36.731 --> 06:38.131
Have a seat. Get comfortable.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.699
I'll have Charlie get us sushi.

06:39.734 --> 06:41.968
Don't talk to me like I work for you.

06:42.003 --> 06:43.970
Julianne...

06:44.005 --> 06:45.839
Sevvy is a fugitive.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.507
I need you here.

06:50.378 --> 06:51.707
Fine.

06:52.747 --> 06:54.314
But I'm gonna need sake.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.951
Flight N8Z92 landed two hours ago

06:57.985 --> 07:00.220
in Vegas with seven passengers.

07:00.254 --> 07:02.656
I doubt Johnson's hitching a
ride with a bachelorette party.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.190
Well, that still leaves us 12 flights.

07:04.225 --> 07:07.100
- Sevvy's about to land in Atlanta.
- How do you know?

07:07.125 --> 07:08.895
The flight attendant
took a picture of him.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.864
She sent it to a friend
who posted it on Twitter.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.033
Call the Atlanta P.D. and U.S. Marshals.

07:13.067 --> 07:14.801
Have them meet Sevvy's plane
on the ground.

07:14.835 --> 07:15.902
I'm friends with the Atlanta D.A.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.037
I'll make sure he's up to speed.

07:17.071 --> 07:21.041
CJ, tell us everything you know
about Flight N73D4.

07:21.075 --> 07:22.976
It left Van Nuys

07:23.010 --> 07:25.145
at 2:20 P.M. with a solo passenger.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.981
It's gonna land in Atlanta at
10:15 Eastern Standard Time.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.649
Ugh. That only gives us 25 minutes.

07:29.684 --> 07:31.351
Ah. News travels fast.

07:31.385 --> 07:33.319
...reports that Sevvy Johnson's plane

07:33.354 --> 07:35.522
is headed to Atlanta. In a moment,

07:35.556 --> 07:38.425
we'll be switching to our locl
affiliate for live coverage.

07:38.459 --> 07:39.492
We're starting our descent.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.528
The captain has requested
you fasten your seatbelt.

07:41.562 --> 07:44.097
Um, did he call the ground crew?

07:44.131 --> 07:45.432
Are the trucks ready to refuel?

07:45.466 --> 07:47.067
They're waiting on the tarmac.

07:47.101 --> 07:49.536
The captain's also asking
for your next destination.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.271
He needs to file another flight plan.

07:51.305 --> 07:53.073
Um...

07:54.721 --> 07:56.822
I'll let him know
once we're done refueling.

07:56.847 --> 07:58.581
Please, uh, tell him to hurry.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.923
4,000 feet over Atlanta.

08:09.957 --> 08:11.858
And now we're looking at live coverage

08:11.892 --> 08:13.960
of Sevvy Johnson's plane
making its approach

08:13.994 --> 08:16.029
to the private terminal at
Sullivan Wade Regional Airpor.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.130
How far away are the police?

08:17.164 --> 08:18.598
Yeah, they're on the scene.

08:24.672 --> 08:27.107
Sevvy Johnson's plane
has just touched down.

08:47.595 --> 08:50.063
Atlanta P.D. is taking no chances.

08:50.097 --> 08:52.398
They have Sevvy Johnson
completely surrounded.

08:52.433 --> 08:54.634
The question is, will he surrender?

08:54.668 --> 08:56.569
Uh, sir?

08:56.604 --> 08:57.971
We can't refuel.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.939
They're telling me to open that door.

08:59.974 --> 09:03.109
Do not open that door, okay?

09:03.144 --> 09:05.445
Leave the door, please.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.483
Oh, God.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.954
Jules.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.122
Baby, I messed up.

09:16.157 --> 09:17.490
I-I don't know what to do.

09:17.525 --> 09:19.038
Listen to me.

09:19.527 --> 09:21.094
I'm watching the news.

09:23.731 --> 09:24.931
We love you.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.200
Your whole family loves you.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.835
What do I do?

09:28.869 --> 09:32.305
You're going to put your hands
on top of your head,

09:32.339 --> 09:35.975
and you're going to walk out
of that plane like a man.

09:36.010 --> 09:37.143
Do it now.

09:37.178 --> 09:39.045
Those beautiful children of yours

09:39.079 --> 09:41.648
are not gonna lose their father today.

09:43.348 --> 09:45.118
I'm sorry.

10:08.342 --> 10:09.576
There he is.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.629
He appears to be surrendering.

10:19.553 --> 10:22.222
Severen Johnson, you're under arrest.

10:22.256 --> 10:24.057
You have the right to remain silent.

10:24.091 --> 10:26.693
Anything you say can ad
will be used against yo.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.199
Excuse me, ma'am, you can't be here.

10:33.234 --> 10:36.102
I have a right to be here.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.204
My name is Angela Ashley,

10:38.239 --> 10:39.739
and I am Sevvy Johnson's lawyer.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.908
Now, I'd like a moment with my client.

10:43.978 --> 10:45.078
Let's go.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.679
Who the hell is that?

10:52.569 --> 10:54.470
Who the hell is Angela Ashley?

10:54.504 --> 10:55.737
Charlie! I'm on it.

10:57.507 --> 10:58.907
Did he hire another lawyer?

10:58.942 --> 11:01.176
Not that I know of, but I like her.

11:03.012 --> 11:04.480
It's a Georgia number.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.187
- Ezra Wolf.
- Mr. Wolf.

11:12.222 --> 11:14.556
This is Angela Ashley.
I'm sitting with your client.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.825
Sevvy, are you there? You okay?

11:16.860 --> 11:18.160
I'm in cuffs, Wolf.

11:18.194 --> 11:19.828
What do you think?

11:19.863 --> 11:22.097
Look, Ms. Ashley,
I don't know who you are

11:22.132 --> 11:23.532
or what you think you're doing, but...

11:23.566 --> 11:25.834
I'm your client's
Get Out Of Jail Free car.

11:25.869 --> 11:28.704
I just finished telling Sevvy,
I've been following his case.

11:28.738 --> 11:30.672
I live 15 minutes away.
When I saw the news,

11:30.707 --> 11:33.041
it seemed like he needed an assist.

11:33.076 --> 11:36.111
An assist? And what kind of
an assist are you offering?

11:36.146 --> 11:38.547
Right now, the whole world thinks
your client's trying to flee.

11:38.581 --> 11:40.382
I can provide a different story.

11:40.416 --> 11:42.784
Sevvy flew to Atlanta to pick up

11:42.819 --> 11:45.687
the newest member
of his defense team... me.

11:45.722 --> 11:47.923
Well, I see you were on
the Law Review at Yale

11:47.957 --> 11:50.359
and you spent six years
at the Innocence Project.

11:50.393 --> 11:52.528
Some would find those
credentials impressive.

11:52.562 --> 11:54.763
Me, I would send your résumé
straight to the shredder.

11:55.765 --> 11:57.199
I'm not into do-gooders.

11:57.233 --> 11:59.134
How do you feel about winners?

11:59.169 --> 12:00.435
I've gotten six men off of death row.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.205
And frankly, you don't have a choice.

12:03.239 --> 12:05.307
No judge is going to grant bail

12:05.341 --> 12:08.010
if it looks like Sevvy's a flight risk.

12:09.279 --> 12:10.846
Wolf, I'm sold.

12:12.315 --> 12:13.863
Angela.

12:14.763 --> 12:16.163
Welcome to the team.

12:17.187 --> 12:20.455
I just spoke to my client,
who, as I said,

12:20.490 --> 12:23.225
is only in Atlanta because
he was gracious enough

12:23.259 --> 12:24.560
to come pick me up.

12:24.594 --> 12:27.229
He's shaken, but in good spirits.

12:27.263 --> 12:30.132
Honestly, if I had known I ws
gonna cause all this trouble,

12:30.166 --> 12:31.633
I would have flown commercial.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.402
Unbelievable. I can't believe the press

12:33.436 --> 12:34.836
is buying this crap.

12:34.871 --> 12:36.772
Is there any way that this could be true?

12:36.806 --> 12:39.174
I mean, is it possible that
he chartered a plane

12:39.209 --> 12:41.176
to pick up his new lawyer
at the exact time

12:41.211 --> 12:42.211
we were closing in on him?

12:42.245 --> 12:45.180
I hear myself. I-I-I know.
It's complete crap.

12:45.215 --> 12:47.182
The question is, will a judge buy it?

12:47.217 --> 12:48.150
Because then we're really screwed.

12:48.184 --> 12:49.851
All right, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

12:49.886 --> 12:52.120
We have an arraignment tomorrow.
We deal with that.

12:52.155 --> 12:55.357
Then... we worry about this mess.

12:55.391 --> 12:57.025
Let's try and get some sleep.

12:57.060 --> 12:58.660
Tomorrow, we see Sevvy in court.

13:01.831 --> 13:04.081
Thank you so much for coming, Julianne.

13:04.115 --> 13:06.535
Sevvy's lucky to have you.

13:06.569 --> 13:08.876
I'll be in touch. Sure.

13:09.505 --> 13:13.942
Buck. You remember the luminous Julianne.

13:13.977 --> 13:16.178
- Pleasure to see you.
- You, too.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.784
- Luminous, huh?
- Yep.

13:22.819 --> 13:25.153
Interesting word to describe
somebody you're trying to frame.

13:25.188 --> 13:26.288
Where are we at with that?

13:26.322 --> 13:28.056
Sevvy was tightening
the belt on her payments

13:28.091 --> 13:29.157
for the last year or so.

13:29.192 --> 13:31.860
She was down to almost nothing,
until Jessica died.

13:31.894 --> 13:33.495
Ooh. Suddenly,

13:33.529 --> 13:35.297
back on the payroll.

13:35.331 --> 13:37.899
I can massage that into motive.

13:37.934 --> 13:40.302
- What else we got?
- Well, I was going through her alibi

13:40.336 --> 13:41.903
for the night of the murder.

13:41.938 --> 13:43.705
She said she was home.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.474
One neighbor says
they saw the light turn on.

13:45.508 --> 13:47.309
The other says they saw the car gone.

13:47.343 --> 13:48.624
Dig deeper.

13:49.212 --> 13:50.712
I have a feeling this case
is going the distance,

13:50.747 --> 13:52.086
and I need more.

13:52.615 --> 13:54.683
Ezra, have you thought of telling Sevvy

13:54.717 --> 13:55.784
you're going down this road?

13:55.818 --> 13:59.021
I mean, he and Julianne,
they look out for each other.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.356
If Sevvy knew what was good for him,

14:01.391 --> 14:03.091
none of us would be here.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.599
Oh, look who's finally home.

14:44.634 --> 14:47.736
Yeah. I feel like I
haven't seen you in forever.

14:47.770 --> 14:49.852
I've missed you. Oh...

14:52.342 --> 14:55.043
You okay? Mm...

14:55.078 --> 14:59.247
I'm just a little nervous
about the arraignment tomorrow.

14:59.282 --> 15:01.116
First time back in court.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.352
It's nothing. You'll be great.

15:04.420 --> 15:06.388
I should go to bed.

15:06.422 --> 15:08.323
Are you coming? Mm-hmm.

15:08.358 --> 15:10.125
Be there in a minute. Okay.

15:25.942 --> 15:27.309
You okay? Yeah.

15:27.343 --> 15:28.910
It's an arraignment.
I could do it in my sleep.

15:29.879 --> 15:31.580
Ms. Travis? There's someone
here to see you.

15:31.614 --> 15:33.248
I'm Lindsay Meyer.

15:33.282 --> 15:37.085
Jessica's sister.
I am so sorry for your loss.

15:37.120 --> 15:39.621
We were just headed down to
court. Is everything okay?

15:39.655 --> 15:40.789
My parents aren't coming.

15:40.823 --> 15:41.990
I tried to convince them,

15:42.024 --> 15:43.525
but they're just so broken up.

15:43.559 --> 15:44.960
Of course. I get it.

15:44.994 --> 15:46.528
I'm sorry about what my dad said to you.

15:46.562 --> 15:47.633
He's not himself.

15:47.667 --> 15:50.198
But you don't have to apologize, Lindsay.

15:50.233 --> 15:52.164
The important thing is that you're here.

15:52.635 --> 15:54.603
I can't believe I'm gonna
see him in court.

15:54.637 --> 15:55.842
I know.

15:55.877 --> 15:58.473
Look, it's not gonna be easy
for you to see him.

15:59.442 --> 16:02.878
But we're gonna make him pay
for what he did.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.011
I'll be all right.

16:21.097 --> 16:22.097
You okay?

16:22.131 --> 16:24.238
I will be once I get out of here.

16:24.834 --> 16:26.835
- Good morning, Angela.
- Mr. Wolf.

16:26.869 --> 16:28.170
Oh, call me Ezra.

16:28.204 --> 16:30.405
You're not up to speed.
I'll do the talking.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.870
All rise.

16:32.742 --> 16:35.477
Department 125 of the
Superior Court of Los Angeles

16:35.511 --> 16:36.745
is now in session.

16:36.779 --> 16:39.214
The honorable
Judge Sandra Song presiding.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.984
Be seated.

16:45.188 --> 16:47.823
Well, this isn't your first rodeo.

16:47.857 --> 16:49.558
Will the defendant waive reading

16:49.592 --> 16:51.593
of the complaint and statement of rights?

16:51.627 --> 16:53.392
Uh, yes, Your Honor.

16:53.963 --> 16:57.098
Mr. Johnson is ready to enter his plea.

16:57.133 --> 16:59.601
Ms. Travis? Please do the honors.

16:59.635 --> 17:01.236
Here we go again.

17:02.805 --> 17:05.194
Is your true name Severen Johnson?

17:06.055 --> 17:07.422
Yes.

17:07.446 --> 17:10.348
Mr. Johnson, you're charged
with first-degree murder

17:10.546 --> 17:15.416
in violation of Penal Code
Section 187, subdivision A.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.618
To this charge, how do you plead?

17:17.653 --> 17:19.554
Guilty or not guilty?

17:20.556 --> 17:23.558
I'm absolutely not guilty.

17:30.712 --> 17:34.728
Hey, are you guys seriously
slow-clapping an arraignment?

17:34.753 --> 17:36.420
It felt damn good to hear you

17:36.454 --> 17:38.088
read that charge against Sevvy.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.090
It felt pretty good to say it.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.092
The bail hearing's set for tomorrow.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.761
Okay. We need to make sure

17:43.795 --> 17:45.095
the judge sees Sevvy as a flight risk.

17:45.130 --> 17:48.065
That shouldn't be too hard,
since he literally flew.

17:48.099 --> 17:50.167
But the Angela Ashley story's
getting traction,

17:50.201 --> 17:52.936
and Wolf is telling anyone
in the press who will listen.

17:52.971 --> 17:54.838
Well, I reached out to the pilot
and the flight attendant.

17:54.873 --> 17:57.007
I can find out if Sevvy
filed another flight plan.

17:57.042 --> 17:58.542
If the parents are a no-show again,

17:58.576 --> 18:00.110
who else do we have to sit on our side?

18:00.145 --> 18:02.046
Other relatives, friends?

18:02.080 --> 18:03.080
Gabe Johnson.

18:03.114 --> 18:05.349
I called in some favors
and got him released.

18:05.383 --> 18:06.550
He's in a safe house.

18:06.584 --> 18:08.752
Hm, Johnson's son sitting on our side.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.055
That's making a statement.
I'll reach out.

18:11.089 --> 18:13.023
Walk with me, Matthew. I need caffeine.

18:15.960 --> 18:17.261
So, what's up?

18:17.295 --> 18:19.663
This bail hearing is everything.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.633
If we lose tomorrow and Sevvy walks,

18:22.667 --> 18:24.635
that sends a message
to our potential jury

18:24.669 --> 18:25.702
that our case is weak.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.638
Well, it's a good thing
you're great under pressure.

18:27.672 --> 18:29.306
So are you.

18:29.340 --> 18:31.909
I want you there with me.
I will be there.

18:31.943 --> 18:33.777
No, at counsel table.

18:33.812 --> 18:36.413
I saw you in the gallery today.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.949
You wanted in on the action.
Tell me I'm wrong.

18:39.951 --> 18:41.085
You're not wrong.

18:42.987 --> 18:44.121
Count me in.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.091
Okay.

18:52.664 --> 18:54.098
The inner sanctum.

18:54.132 --> 18:55.999
My associates don't get
to set foot in here

18:56.034 --> 18:58.001
without a thousand billable hours.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.170
I hope you feel at home. Thank you.

19:00.205 --> 19:02.139
- You're welcome.
- It's beautiful.

19:02.173 --> 19:03.841
I need to see everything
you've got so far.

19:03.875 --> 19:06.176
Mm-hmm.
Discovery, investigative reports...

19:06.211 --> 19:08.612
Mm. You're a busywork person.

19:08.646 --> 19:10.814
The devil is in the details. Isn't she?

19:10.849 --> 19:12.197
Well...

19:12.817 --> 19:14.351
here we are, Georgia...

19:14.385 --> 19:15.652
your new office.

19:15.687 --> 19:18.188
Befitting your stature, don't you think?

19:20.291 --> 19:23.093
- It'll do just fine.
- Mm.

19:23.128 --> 19:25.362
Let's be clear about one thing. Hm?

19:25.396 --> 19:27.498
I'm Sevvy Johnson's lawyer.

19:27.532 --> 19:29.766
You can have your 15 minutes
sitting next to me

19:29.801 --> 19:31.123
during the bail hearing...

19:31.157 --> 19:34.845
because you have chutzpah,
I'll give you that...

19:35.740 --> 19:37.556
but I run the show.

19:38.376 --> 19:39.810
I am the show.

19:39.844 --> 19:41.378
Got it.

19:41.412 --> 19:43.180
You're all show.

19:44.983 --> 19:47.151
When I can get those files?

19:47.185 --> 19:48.986
I'd like to hit the ground running.

19:49.020 --> 19:52.890
Charlie, give Ms. Ashley those files.

19:52.924 --> 19:54.992
We'll let her hit the ground...

19:55.026 --> 19:56.226
running.

19:58.763 --> 20:00.197
Thank you.

20:05.103 --> 20:07.070
All the problems we've had,

20:07.105 --> 20:09.673
you've always been a good father.

20:09.707 --> 20:12.242
I still am a good father.

20:12.277 --> 20:13.677
I wasn't gonna run, Jules.

20:13.711 --> 20:15.078
I just went to pick up my new lawyer.

20:15.113 --> 20:18.148
Don't lie to me, Sevvy.
I've known you for too long.

20:18.183 --> 20:20.984
You abandoned a 9-year-old child.

20:21.019 --> 20:22.219
I was scared.

20:24.055 --> 20:26.423
I just needed a few days

20:26.457 --> 20:28.058
to clear my head.

20:28.092 --> 20:29.927
And now you need a favor.

20:29.961 --> 20:31.041
It's about bail...

20:31.075 --> 20:32.396
You don't have the money? I do.

20:32.430 --> 20:34.164
Wolf says it'll look better to the judge

20:34.199 --> 20:35.499
if someone else posts it.

20:38.303 --> 20:39.903
Someone respected.

20:40.972 --> 20:43.240
And you want me to ask Vick.

20:43.274 --> 20:44.675
He's an NBA star.

20:44.709 --> 20:46.777
Everybody knows and respects him.

20:46.811 --> 20:49.513
We've both known him a long time.

20:49.547 --> 20:51.248
He was one of the only
people who stood by me

20:51.282 --> 20:52.516
during the first trial.

20:52.550 --> 20:55.219
I just need you to talk to him, okay?

20:55.253 --> 20:57.287
Tell him I didn't kill Jessica.

21:04.262 --> 21:06.561
I'm gonna leave these with the guard.

21:07.298 --> 21:09.266
Sign them,

21:09.300 --> 21:11.725
and then I'll talk to Vick. What is it?

21:11.759 --> 21:14.304
Papers making me a controlling
partner in your trust.

21:14.339 --> 21:17.274
- What?
- Seeing you on that plane

21:17.308 --> 21:20.043
made me think of life if we lost you.

21:20.078 --> 21:21.245
What if you have to stay in here?

21:21.279 --> 21:23.380
What if Jessica's family sues you?

21:23.414 --> 21:24.815
Jules...
Who's gonna pay for Sunny's college?

21:24.849 --> 21:27.985
- Jules, listen to me.
- I have to protect this family.

21:28.019 --> 21:30.320
I'm... You'll sign those for me,

21:30.355 --> 21:32.456
and I'll call Vick for you.

21:33.245 --> 21:34.224
Jul...

21:36.594 --> 21:38.061
Pick up the phone. Jules!

21:47.839 --> 21:49.339
Please,

21:49.374 --> 21:51.241
tell me you've got good news.

21:51.276 --> 21:53.543
I've had a very productive day.

21:58.616 --> 22:01.051
Let's see what we've got.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.595
- Is this real?
- As real as it gets.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.049
Julianne.

22:19.404 --> 22:23.006
You've been a very, very bad girl.

22:28.623 --> 22:30.190
Georgia.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.959
How's my new favorite legal eagle?

22:33.094 --> 22:34.695
Wary. Wary?

22:34.729 --> 22:37.097
- Why so friendly?
- I'm in a good mood.

22:37.132 --> 22:38.765
I'm in a very good mood.

22:38.800 --> 22:40.200
Oh. I got the silver bullet

22:40.235 --> 22:42.236
that I need to win Sevvy's bail hearing.

22:42.270 --> 22:45.072
Hell, this thing might
not even make it to trial.

22:45.106 --> 22:46.373
I'm waiting.

22:46.407 --> 22:47.875
Oh, I'm not gonna tell you what it is.

22:47.909 --> 22:50.010
But I do have a little job for you.

22:50.044 --> 22:51.612
How are your babysitting skills?

22:53.648 --> 22:55.716
Thanks for coming through, mate.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.751
You always do.

22:57.785 --> 22:59.219
Well, eight years ago, I gave you

22:59.254 --> 23:00.687
the benefit of the doubt.

23:00.722 --> 23:04.224
But now? I can't say that, Sev.

23:07.328 --> 23:10.264
Listen, I was innocent,
and I'm innocent now.

23:10.298 --> 23:13.033
I'm gonna prove it. I just
need to get out of this cell.

23:13.067 --> 23:16.236
Julianne says you want me
to offer to post bail?

23:16.271 --> 23:18.568
Wolf thinks it'll mean
a lot to the judge,

23:19.307 --> 23:22.276
a man like you standing up for me.

23:22.310 --> 23:24.466
And if you run? I won't.

23:25.513 --> 23:26.780
I promise.

23:28.149 --> 23:29.750
Look, Vick,

23:29.784 --> 23:31.623
if you're not gonna do it for me,

23:32.187 --> 23:34.655
do it for my kids. Sunny's 9 years old.

23:34.689 --> 23:36.924
I mean, you don't want her to see
her father through iron bars...

23:36.958 --> 23:40.495
Don't use the kids to manipulate me.

23:40.530 --> 23:41.675
Vick.

23:42.297 --> 23:43.729
I'm asking.

23:49.437 --> 23:51.505
I... I'll think about it.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.211
Thanks.

23:59.483 --> 24:01.281
Show Mr. Marshall out, please.

24:04.018 --> 24:06.853
You all right? Yeah. Fine.

24:06.888 --> 24:08.577
How's things with Wolf?

24:09.390 --> 24:11.925
To be honest, he's shutting me out...

24:11.960 --> 24:13.427
too busy protecting his territory,

24:13.461 --> 24:15.195
walking around like
a master of the universe,

24:15.230 --> 24:17.103
when really he's just a sideshow magician

24:17.137 --> 24:18.157
with a tired bag of tricks.

24:18.182 --> 24:19.429
Look, you may have saved
my ass yesterday,

24:19.464 --> 24:20.834
but Wolf saved my life.

24:20.868 --> 24:22.536
He knows what he's doing.

24:22.570 --> 24:24.471
Let's talk about what
I should wear tomorrow.

24:26.407 --> 24:27.441
Okay.

24:28.910 --> 24:30.944
- So, you'll open...
- And intro the case.

24:30.979 --> 24:33.347
I'll talk about how Sevvy
had motive, opportunity...

24:33.381 --> 24:35.349
And that we can place him
at the crime scene.

24:35.383 --> 24:36.883
Then I'll talk flight risk.

24:36.918 --> 24:38.719
The flight attendant's
affidavit just came in...

24:38.753 --> 24:40.988
We have to be ready
to counter Wolf's B.S.

24:41.022 --> 24:42.723
And the pilot is still refusing to talk.

24:42.757 --> 24:45.192
And, of course, he's gonna
try and charm the judge.

24:45.226 --> 24:46.827
Which won't work,

24:46.861 --> 24:48.328
because it's Judge Song,

24:48.363 --> 24:50.030
and she always had a thing for you.

24:50.064 --> 24:51.398
And no one's listening to me.

24:51.432 --> 24:53.400
Really? Judge Song? Mm-hmm.

24:53.434 --> 24:54.901
Wear your blue tie.
It'll make your eyes pop.

24:54.936 --> 24:56.103
Okay.

24:56.137 --> 24:58.038
I know you're prepping, but
I need to speak with Matthew.

24:58.072 --> 25:00.240
- Can I have the room for a minute?
- Please.

25:04.245 --> 25:06.380
What's that about?
Ugh. Above my pay grade.

25:09.417 --> 25:10.972
Maya Travis.

25:11.786 --> 25:13.053
Mm-hmm.

25:14.722 --> 25:16.556
Okay.

25:16.591 --> 25:17.791
Thank you.

25:19.460 --> 25:20.594
Everything okay?

25:20.628 --> 25:22.429
Yeah, yeah. That was the LAPD

25:22.463 --> 25:24.498
letting me know that a Mr. River Allgood

25:24.532 --> 25:27.167
reported that I have a stalker.

25:27.201 --> 25:28.869
They want me to come in
and talk to a detective.

25:30.238 --> 25:31.338
Not a horrible idea.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.007
You told him, didn't you?

25:35.443 --> 25:37.177
I can't deal with this right now.

25:38.479 --> 25:39.473
It strikes me as odd.

25:39.507 --> 25:41.415
Konrad Dabrowski is our mole,

25:41.449 --> 25:42.549
but I can't seem to find

25:42.583 --> 25:44.851
his polygraph test in your report.

25:44.886 --> 25:46.299
He didn't take one.

25:47.322 --> 25:49.122
Once Dabrowski knew we were closing in,

25:49.157 --> 25:50.223
he came to me and confessed.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.425
Figured I'd go easier on him.

25:51.459 --> 25:54.061
Why wasn't a police officer
present when you questioned him?

25:54.095 --> 25:56.396
The man was obviously terrified.

25:56.431 --> 25:58.231
I thought he'd be more
forthcoming with me alone,

25:58.266 --> 25:59.479
and he was.

26:00.435 --> 26:02.436
I pulled his employment record, Collier.

26:02.470 --> 26:03.537
Dabrowski wasn't fired.

26:03.571 --> 26:05.972
He was transferred to
the federal building on Flower.

26:06.007 --> 26:08.241
So I'm gonna give you five seconds

26:08.276 --> 26:09.543
to tell me the truth.

26:17.518 --> 26:20.620
Konrad Dabrowski worked in
this building for 30 years.

26:20.655 --> 26:22.255
He made one mistake.

26:22.290 --> 26:24.057
If you want to dig deeper
into my decision

26:24.092 --> 26:26.626
not to ruin his life, go right ahead.

26:26.661 --> 26:27.966
You know what?

26:29.163 --> 26:30.564
I think I will.

26:39.173 --> 26:40.437
Hey.

26:42.009 --> 26:45.011
You filed a police report
without telling me?

26:45.046 --> 26:46.847
You have a stalker, Maya.

26:46.881 --> 26:48.862
You're not doing anything about it.

26:49.550 --> 26:51.418
This is a dangerous situation, all right?

26:51.452 --> 26:53.520
So dangerous that CJ
installed security cameras

26:53.554 --> 26:56.189
- outside the house.
- The guy is a sad sack

26:56.224 --> 26:59.159
who gets his kicks out of
leaving earrings on my doorstep.

26:59.193 --> 27:02.095
Look, the detective I spoke to disagrees.

27:02.130 --> 27:04.431
He thinks that because
this guy re-emerged

27:04.465 --> 27:06.867
so quickly after eight years

27:06.901 --> 27:09.503
that he is an obsessive...

27:09.537 --> 27:11.171
Look, honey, I'm just
trying to protect you.

27:11.205 --> 27:12.466
Yeah, I don't need you to protect me.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.508
Maya... If you want to be with somebody

27:14.542 --> 27:16.810
that you need to save, that's not me.

27:16.844 --> 27:19.446
- I can take care of myself.
- Sticking your head in the sand

27:19.480 --> 27:21.348
isn't necessarily
taking care of yourself.

27:21.382 --> 27:22.949
Do you have any idea

27:22.984 --> 27:25.285
how important tomorrow is to me?
Yes, but -

27:25.319 --> 27:27.687
How long I've waited
to put Johnson behind bars?

27:27.722 --> 27:29.380
Of course, but that has
nothing to do with this.

27:29.405 --> 27:31.958
Yes, it does, because
this is wasting my time

27:31.993 --> 27:34.161
when I should be
concentrating on the case!

27:34.195 --> 27:37.197
You are as obsessive as your stalker.

27:37.231 --> 27:39.566
I'm just gonna do what the detective said

27:39.600 --> 27:41.802
and take all the gifts that
this sicko brought you

27:41.836 --> 27:43.370
down to the police station.

27:46.574 --> 27:47.607
Where are they?

27:48.910 --> 27:50.410
What the hell did you do with them?

27:50.445 --> 27:51.978
Nothing.

27:52.013 --> 27:54.181
Oh, my God, Riv.

27:54.215 --> 27:56.179
He was here.

27:56.684 --> 27:58.585
He was in the house.

28:04.440 --> 28:06.074
Tensions are
running high as Sevvy Johnson

28:06.108 --> 28:08.425
- once again faces...
- Change the channel.

28:08.450 --> 28:10.841
...is going to make a full-court press

28:10.877 --> 28:13.045
to get bail for Johnson,
and the prosec...

28:15.015 --> 28:16.982
You were right to bring the cops in.

28:17.017 --> 28:18.450
He was escalating.

28:18.485 --> 28:20.946
- What do you want to do?
- Put it away for now.

28:20.947 --> 28:22.514
After the hearing's over,
we'll deal with it.

28:25.485 --> 28:27.286
That's my ride. I got to go.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.854
Well, hey. Good luck.

28:44.571 --> 28:47.105
Ready to do this? Ready.

28:58.918 --> 29:00.185
If that monster gets out...

29:00.220 --> 29:01.487
He won't.

29:05.425 --> 29:07.359
Angela. You look beautiful.

29:25.745 --> 29:27.437
All rise.

29:28.581 --> 29:31.049
Department 125 of the
Superior Court of Los Angeles

29:31.084 --> 29:32.251
is now in session.

29:32.285 --> 29:34.386
Judge Sandra Song presiding.

29:34.420 --> 29:36.112
Be seated.

29:36.589 --> 29:39.558
Call the case of
People vs. Severen Johnson.

29:39.592 --> 29:42.928
We're here on a defense motion
to set bail for the defendant.

29:42.962 --> 29:44.830
I'll hear from the People first.

29:52.472 --> 29:55.107
Your Honor, the evidence
against Mr. Johnson

29:55.141 --> 29:57.509
is powerful and convincing.

29:57.544 --> 29:58.644
We have it all.

29:58.678 --> 30:02.681
Motive... Jessica, on tape,
saying Mr. Johnson beat her,

30:02.715 --> 30:04.917
and she was planning to go to the police.

30:04.951 --> 30:08.220
Opportunity... a secret entrance
at his house allowed him

30:08.254 --> 30:10.856
to go on and off the property
without detection.

30:10.890 --> 30:13.625
Consciousness of guilt...
he tried to have evidence

30:13.660 --> 30:16.695
destroyed as soon as he knew
a search warrant was imminent.

30:16.729 --> 30:19.765
We also have forensic evidence
from the crime scene...

30:19.799 --> 30:21.633
DNA evidence that places him there

30:21.668 --> 30:23.268
specifically the morning of the murder.

30:23.303 --> 30:25.137
Ms. Travis, I don't need to hear

30:25.171 --> 30:27.306
how you plan to prove your case at trial.

30:27.340 --> 30:28.607
This is a bail hearing.

30:28.641 --> 30:30.742
Mr. Collier will continue the argument.

30:32.979 --> 30:34.780
Good morning.

30:34.814 --> 30:35.847
There's a saying, Your Honor.

30:35.882 --> 30:37.449
If you want to know what someone will do,

30:37.483 --> 30:39.251
take a look at what he has done.

30:39.285 --> 30:41.820
Now, Mr. Johnson has
already proven himself

30:41.854 --> 30:42.988
to be a flight risk.

30:43.022 --> 30:45.657
This entire courtroom... and
probably most of the nation...

30:45.692 --> 30:49.394
watched as he got caught
trying to evade arrest.

30:49.429 --> 30:51.897
Now, I know the defense will
claim he only flew to Atlanta

30:51.931 --> 30:53.899
to pick up his new lawyer,

30:53.933 --> 30:57.102
but I have a signed affidavit
from the flight attendant

30:57.136 --> 30:59.738
describing how Mr. Johnson
was researching

30:59.772 --> 31:02.474
hotel accommodations in Dubai,

31:02.508 --> 31:04.509
somewhere that does not
have an extradition treaty

31:04.544 --> 31:05.771
with the United States.

31:05.805 --> 31:09.114
We ask that Mr. Johnson
be held without bail.

31:09.148 --> 31:10.540
Thank you.

31:11.551 --> 31:13.352
I'll hear from the defense.

31:13.386 --> 31:15.954
Your Honor, I can stand here,

31:15.989 --> 31:17.522
throw out a lot of words refuting

31:17.557 --> 31:20.659
each of the prosecution's
flimsy arguments,

31:20.693 --> 31:22.527
but that would just
be more air pollution,

31:22.562 --> 31:24.696
and climate change is real.

31:26.332 --> 31:28.767
I could also produce my own affidavit

31:28.801 --> 31:31.503
from the actual pilot
of my client's plane,

31:31.537 --> 31:34.039
who was personally prepared
to file a flight plan

31:34.073 --> 31:35.674
from Atlanta back to L.A.

31:35.708 --> 31:36.708
I could tell you

31:36.743 --> 31:39.444
that my client got on that
flight on my own advice

31:39.479 --> 31:41.680
to woo an extraordinary
attorney to our team.

31:41.714 --> 31:43.849
I could even show you the true measure

31:43.883 --> 31:46.985
of his support and trust
in his community.

31:47.020 --> 31:50.722
Mr. Johnson's longtime friend,
Vick Marshall...

31:50.757 --> 31:54.660
five-time NBA champion,
popular TV personality...

31:54.694 --> 31:56.361
agreed to post his bail.

31:58.097 --> 31:59.564
Now, Your Honor...
I thought you were gonna

31:59.599 --> 32:01.800
minimize air pollution, Counselor.

32:01.834 --> 32:04.136
Touché. Touché.

32:04.170 --> 32:06.538
I just wanted you to know
I've done my homework,

32:06.572 --> 32:08.006
because I have evidence...

32:08.041 --> 32:10.542
evidence the prosecution
should have found

32:10.576 --> 32:12.878
were it not for their
unrelenting tunnel vision,

32:12.912 --> 32:15.681
evidence that proves
the killer is, in fact...

32:18.785 --> 32:20.552
...Julianne Johnson.

32:20.586 --> 32:23.588
- Wolf!
- Objection, Your Honor.

32:23.623 --> 32:25.257
Order! I'll have order.

32:25.291 --> 32:27.859
Your Honor, Julianne Johnson
fought with Jessica Meyer

32:27.894 --> 32:29.151
the night before the murder.

32:29.185 --> 32:31.830
She benefited financially from her death,

32:31.864 --> 32:34.766
and she lied to the police
about her alibi.

32:34.801 --> 32:37.235
If you turn your attention
to the screen...

32:37.270 --> 32:39.204
This video was taken
the morning of the murder.

32:39.238 --> 32:40.706
That is Julianne Johnson

32:40.740 --> 32:42.407
driving down Pacific Coast Highway

32:42.442 --> 32:44.042
away from the crime scene.

32:50.083 --> 32:53.185
Settle right now
or I will clear this court.

32:53.219 --> 32:55.187
Your Honor, there is
no evidence that Julianne

32:55.221 --> 32:57.422
had anything to do with this murder.

32:57.457 --> 32:59.758
It was Sevvy's DNA
at the crime scene, not hers.

32:59.792 --> 33:01.393
- That video proves nothing.
- I can get you out of here,

33:01.418 --> 33:02.660
if you let me.

33:02.685 --> 33:03.965
Thousands of people drive up and down PCH

33:03.996 --> 33:05.321
every day. Do it.

33:06.099 --> 33:07.198
Your Honor.

33:07.767 --> 33:09.601
I have examined every single report

33:09.635 --> 33:12.604
generated by every lab
connected to this case.

33:12.638 --> 33:14.139
As of this date,

33:14.173 --> 33:17.075
22% of the DNA swabs
taken from the crime scene

33:17.110 --> 33:19.111
have not been analyzed.

33:19.145 --> 33:21.947
Furthermore, another 17%

33:21.981 --> 33:24.049
gave inconclusive results.

33:24.083 --> 33:26.283
When everything is said and done...

33:26.919 --> 33:29.488
...we may well find
Julianne Johnson's DNA

33:29.522 --> 33:31.790
was at that crime scene.

33:31.824 --> 33:34.459
- Is that true?
- Yes, but it doesn't invalidate

33:34.494 --> 33:36.561
the fact that Sevvy's DNA was there.

33:36.596 --> 33:37.596
I've heard enough.

33:37.630 --> 33:40.565
Bail is set at $5 million.

33:40.600 --> 33:42.501
Thank you, Your Honor.

33:48.374 --> 33:49.866
Well?

33:49.891 --> 33:52.910
You dragged the mother
of my children into this.

33:55.214 --> 33:56.681
From now on,

33:56.716 --> 33:58.083
you work for her.

34:06.595 --> 34:09.335
It's happening again. All of it.

34:09.360 --> 34:11.261
But this time, it's even worse.

34:11.678 --> 34:13.312
Last time, bail wasn't even an option

34:13.347 --> 34:15.214
because he killed two people...

34:15.248 --> 34:16.815
And he's free, you know,

34:16.850 --> 34:19.985
posing for selfies with fans

34:20.020 --> 34:21.954
and autographing movie posters.

34:21.989 --> 34:23.456
Who wants to get drunk?

34:23.489 --> 34:25.568
How about a toast?

34:26.025 --> 34:29.489
The look on Ezra's face when Sevvy
demoted him to second chair.

34:30.437 --> 34:32.672
That was almost worth it.

34:32.866 --> 34:35.668
However, I'm going to leave the
Monday-morning quarterbacking

34:35.702 --> 34:37.536
to you two,

34:37.571 --> 34:38.838
'cause I have a little girl at home

34:38.871 --> 34:40.833
who needs dinner and a bedtime song.

34:43.510 --> 34:46.078
Ceej. About this whole Julianne thing,

34:46.112 --> 34:48.748
I know Wolf has a flair
for the dramatic, but...

34:48.782 --> 34:50.716
Yeah, we can't have any more surprises.

34:50.751 --> 34:52.518
I will leave no turn un-stoned.

34:52.553 --> 34:54.719
Believe me. Don't drink and drive.

34:59.693 --> 35:00.893
Cheers.

35:12.072 --> 35:15.207
Ezra Wolf called me a murderer

35:15.242 --> 35:17.176
in open court, and you let him.

35:17.210 --> 35:19.445
Wolf was just protecting me.

35:19.479 --> 35:22.448
It worked. Got me out, right?

35:22.482 --> 35:25.585
Of course you would defend that lowlife.

35:25.619 --> 35:27.587
Why would I expect you to have

35:27.621 --> 35:30.222
any sense of morality,
after all you've done?

35:30.257 --> 35:32.558
What about what you've done, huh?

35:32.593 --> 35:34.927
That video of your little
joyride down the PCH

35:34.962 --> 35:37.029
right by Vick's house.

35:37.064 --> 35:39.065
Now I know why you lied to
the police about your alibi.

35:39.099 --> 35:41.233
Because you didn't want me to
know that you were screwing him!

35:41.268 --> 35:42.602
That's right, Sevvy.

35:42.636 --> 35:45.137
I was screwing Vick damn Marshall.

35:45.172 --> 35:47.607
It's been going on for months.
The kids knew it.

35:47.641 --> 35:49.475
- Everybody but you knew it.
- You think I give a damn

35:49.509 --> 35:50.977
about who's in your bloody bed?

35:51.011 --> 35:53.045
You always want to think you own me.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.715
There's nobody but the great
Sevvy Johnson in my life.

35:55.749 --> 35:56.805
You know what? He can have you.

35:56.840 --> 35:58.050
He'll find out just what I found out.

35:58.085 --> 36:00.252
All you care about is money.

36:00.287 --> 36:02.755
I built this family.

36:02.789 --> 36:04.457
I am the mother of your children.

36:04.491 --> 36:06.592
I have earned every penny

36:06.627 --> 36:08.260
I've gotten from you. You earned?

36:08.295 --> 36:09.762
Who do you think paid for this, huh?

36:09.796 --> 36:12.064
But that was your little plan, wasn't it?

36:13.033 --> 36:15.668
I'd sign over my trust,
piss off to prison,

36:15.702 --> 36:17.737
and you get everything.

36:17.771 --> 36:18.738
Yeah.

36:18.772 --> 36:21.240
And I get a man who's kind

36:21.274 --> 36:23.909
and thoughtful and gentle

36:23.944 --> 36:25.845
and, unlike you,

36:25.879 --> 36:27.847
has never laid a single hand...

36:27.881 --> 36:30.416
Go ahead, Sevvy. Do it. I'll tell you -

36:30.450 --> 36:31.707
Don't push me.
- Hit me.

36:31.741 --> 36:34.286
I have spent half my life
covering for you...

36:34.321 --> 36:36.155
For me? ...rationalizing your rage.

36:36.189 --> 36:37.790
Well, no more!

36:37.824 --> 36:39.692
Go ahead. Take a swing.

36:39.726 --> 36:41.327
That's what you want, isn't it?
That's just what you want.

36:41.361 --> 36:43.696
Those reporters right outside
your front door...

36:43.730 --> 36:45.362
Yeah? ...are your judge, your jury,

36:45.387 --> 36:46.766
and your executioner.

36:46.800 --> 36:50.469
I leave here with so much
as a single hair out of place,

36:50.504 --> 36:52.171
and it's your ass.

36:52.205 --> 36:54.340
You listen to me.

36:54.374 --> 36:57.476
I'm gonna let Wolf
take you down for this.

36:57.511 --> 36:59.812
You'll lose everything...
the house, the money...

36:59.846 --> 37:02.815
and your kids will see you
from behind bars

37:02.849 --> 37:04.684
for the rest of your sorry-ass life.

37:06.486 --> 37:09.722
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

37:24.204 --> 37:26.305
Thanks for coming. No problem.

37:27.374 --> 37:28.708
She didn't tell you, did she?

37:28.742 --> 37:30.409
What?

37:30.444 --> 37:32.411
The stalker, he was in the house.

37:32.446 --> 37:33.446
What?

37:33.480 --> 37:35.915
He messed with the security
cameras, he broke in,

37:35.949 --> 37:37.983
and then he took all of the boxes back.

37:38.018 --> 37:40.086
How did he even know? Exactly.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.421
What, they all disappear
right after I call the police?

37:42.456 --> 37:43.723
No.

37:43.757 --> 37:45.191
He was listening.

37:46.593 --> 37:47.893
What do we do?

37:47.928 --> 37:49.395
We find out how.

37:49.429 --> 37:51.030
Yeah.

37:51.064 --> 37:52.765
Yes.

37:52.799 --> 37:55.568
Now, this space is more my speed.

37:56.937 --> 37:58.938
Bask in the moment,

37:58.972 --> 38:00.506
because it won't last long.

38:01.908 --> 38:03.709
Get some sleep tonight.

38:03.744 --> 38:04.910
We've got a lot of work to do tomorrow,

38:04.945 --> 38:06.746
and I like to start early.

38:16.123 --> 38:17.890
Oh!

38:17.924 --> 38:19.925
- Nice!
- You see? You see?

38:19.960 --> 38:22.294
I'm... I'm just way better
after a few drinks.

38:22.329 --> 38:24.196
I need another drink.

38:24.231 --> 38:25.931
Good idea. Mm.

38:36.843 --> 38:38.544
I laugh, you know.

38:39.946 --> 38:40.946
What?

38:40.981 --> 38:43.382
In normal life, I laugh.

38:43.416 --> 38:45.084
I remember.

38:45.118 --> 38:46.786
Even though it all went to hell today,

38:46.820 --> 38:48.587
I'm glad we were there together.

38:52.692 --> 38:54.660
If things were different...

38:58.965 --> 39:00.301
I can't.

39:01.501 --> 39:03.702
I want to. But I can't.

39:41.641 --> 39:43.309
Listen to this, you sick son of a bitch.

39:43.343 --> 39:44.543
This is over.

39:44.578 --> 39:46.145
I'm coming for you. Do you hear me?

39:46.179 --> 39:47.780
I am coming for you.

39:52.385 --> 39:53.652
Ms. Travis.

39:53.687 --> 39:55.022
Hey, Leo.

39:55.722 --> 39:58.290
- Have a good night.
- You, too.

40:11.905 --> 40:14.173
You should've fired him.

40:14.207 --> 40:15.841
What?

40:15.876 --> 40:17.042
The janitor.

40:17.077 --> 40:19.879
If you would've fired him,
I never would've figured it out,

40:19.913 --> 40:21.981
but you're just too damn nice.

40:22.015 --> 40:23.482
Figured what out?

40:23.516 --> 40:26.685
Loni. She's the leak.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.020
Alan, we... No.

40:28.054 --> 40:30.055
Don't try to lawyer me.

40:30.090 --> 40:31.857
You see, I kept thinking,

40:31.892 --> 40:33.092
why would he go to such lengths

40:33.126 --> 40:35.094
to protect the identity of the mole?

40:35.128 --> 40:37.830
Then I remembered you brought Loni in.

40:37.864 --> 40:38.977
You mentored her.

40:39.012 --> 40:41.000
You gave her the biggest
case of her career,

40:41.034 --> 40:43.195
then you yanked it away.

40:44.104 --> 40:45.204
That would've pissed me off, too.

40:45.238 --> 40:47.373
See, I would have confronted
her, but wouldn't you know,

40:47.407 --> 40:50.442
she called in sick
for the first time ever.

40:50.477 --> 40:51.744
I had my reasons.

40:52.946 --> 40:54.123
I know you did.

40:54.814 --> 40:57.016
Question now is,

40:57.050 --> 40:58.117
what do I do?

40:58.151 --> 40:59.852
I could fire you,

40:59.886 --> 41:02.054
maybe even have you arrested.

41:02.088 --> 41:04.056
Or I could tell Maya.

41:04.090 --> 41:05.843
She'd never forgive you.

41:06.626 --> 41:09.762
But I won't, 'cause it was
the right play.

41:09.796 --> 41:11.931
Then Maya would've gone
all shock and awe.

41:11.965 --> 41:14.066
We can't take another scandal.
We need the win.

41:18.004 --> 41:20.039
I'm, uh...

41:20.073 --> 41:22.318
glad we see eye-to-eye on this.

41:22.976 --> 41:24.576
Oh, we do.

42:11.057 --> 42:13.125
You murdered my sister.

42:16.029 --> 42:17.529
Now you're gonna pay.
