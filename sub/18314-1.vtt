02:28.490 --> 02:30.906
Please, please, you must come quick.

02:30.932 --> 02:33.430
There's a woman lying dead
out on the moors.

02:42.238 --> 02:45.820
It's alright, miss.
No need for you to take another look.

02:48.322 --> 02:50.905
Ruber. Alice. Mrs.

02:51.030 --> 02:54.112
I'd say she's been dead
for no more than two hours.

02:54.238 --> 02:57.439
Say four o'clock at the outside
for time of death.

03:10.740 --> 03:13.030
Hercules Parrot, sir.

03:13.156 --> 03:14.447
Poirot, mademoiselle.

03:14.615 --> 03:18.530
Pucker your lips as though
about to bestow a kiss! Poi-rot.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.073
Morning, Poirot.
I hope you have good news.

03:21.198 --> 03:23.530
This case has been hanging fire
for four months.

03:23.656 --> 03:26.323
No, I'm afraid
it's one of those rare cases

03:26.448 --> 03:28.947
where an insurance company must, er...

03:29.907 --> 03:32.223
laugh and lump it.

03:36.483 --> 03:37.857
Very well.

03:39.066 --> 03:41.148
The usual 100 guineas, I take it?

03:43.138 --> 03:46.221
By the way, Poirot...
Take a look at this.

03:48.649 --> 03:50.523
It is the property of Sir Horace Blatt.

03:50.649 --> 03:53.524
He is seeking to insure it with us
for £50,000.

03:57.233 --> 04:01.383
Well, on the face of it...
it seems to be worth every penny of...

04:01.820 --> 04:06.159
£38 pounds...
seven shillings and sixpence.

04:07.720 --> 04:09.566
You are of course quite right.
It is paste.

04:09.692 --> 04:13.823
The question is why should
a millionaire industrialist

04:13.958 --> 04:16.539
perpetrate such an obvious fraud?

04:16.658 --> 04:19.825
Precisely. He must have known
the stone would be examined.

04:20.312 --> 04:23.562
So you see...
there is something of a mystery.

04:23.796 --> 04:28.216
Rest assured, with Hercule Poirot...
mysteries never last for long.

04:30.485 --> 04:34.817
Exactly. We were wondering if you would
undertake to investigate the matter.

04:34.857 --> 04:36.973
You know that you can count on
my discretion.

04:37.831 --> 04:42.320
Very well, I will see Sir Horace...
this afternoon.

04:42.693 --> 04:47.193
Hardly this afternoon, I think.
He's on his yacht, the Jolly Roger...

04:47.319 --> 04:50.515
in the south of France.
Would a further £200 meet the case?

04:52.610 --> 04:54.108
Guineas.

04:54.438 --> 04:59.092
It will make my forthcoming holidays
even more attractive.

05:21.695 --> 05:23.616
So that's your game, is it?

05:23.833 --> 05:29.748
You come out here and as near as dammit
accuse me, Horace Blatt, of fraud?

05:29.968 --> 05:32.842
Do you seriously think
that I'd cheat the insurance company

05:32.877 --> 05:36.335
over one bloody jewel?
I am worth millions, Poirot.

05:36.571 --> 05:39.843
Nevertheless, I'm afraid
it's quite worthless, messieur.

05:40.863 --> 05:42.987
God, I could wring her bloody neck!

05:43.698 --> 05:47.864
If you would care to confide in me...
I should be most honoured.

05:49.139 --> 05:51.348
Alright, I'll tell you this much.

05:52.092 --> 05:55.632
A couple of months back...
I met a certain lady in New York.

05:55.820 --> 05:58.106
She told me she was
so madly in love with me

05:58.238 --> 06:01.642
that she'd leave the show she was in...
She was an actress, you know.

06:01.822 --> 06:04.946
And come back to England with me
on the Queen Mary and marry me.

06:04.993 --> 06:07.617
So I bought her this stone
from Tiffany's.

06:07.822 --> 06:11.312
Halfway across the Atlantic, she changed
her mind and ran off with another man.

06:11.520 --> 06:14.353
I wouldn't have minded...
only she took the jewel with her.

06:14.728 --> 06:16.186
That wasn't a fair do.

06:16.281 --> 06:19.563
You see, I had given her it
in contemplation of marriage.

06:19.775 --> 06:21.983
And, frankly...
$100,000 is a bit much to pay

06:22.030 --> 06:24.519
for three days' fumbling
on the high seas.

06:24.572 --> 06:28.030
Oh, messieur, who can put a price on
les affaires de coeur?

06:28.294 --> 06:29.459
I bloody can.

06:29.782 --> 06:31.238
And this was too high.

06:31.476 --> 06:34.594
So, three weeks ago...
I went after her and demanded it back.

06:34.854 --> 06:38.895
Of course she tried to put me off, but
after a week or so she gave it to me

06:38.966 --> 06:41.564
and I sent it along to be insured and...

06:42.166 --> 06:44.291
She'd had the bloody thing copied...
hadn't she?

06:44.398 --> 06:47.448
It would appear to be
the only explanation, messieur.

06:47.519 --> 06:49.916
Well, she's not gonna make
a chump out of me.

06:50.845 --> 06:54.435
I happen to know that in three days'
time she'll be down at Daphne's place

06:54.824 --> 06:56.316
for a little holiday.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.961
I'll give her a little holiday!

06:59.281 --> 07:00.989
Daphne's place?

07:02.083 --> 07:04.870
Yes, you know, Daphne Castle.

07:05.326 --> 07:08.950
She was a mistress of
the King of Tyrania for years...

07:09.030 --> 07:12.071
then when he upped and married
the present queen

07:12.134 --> 07:15.175
he gave Daphne
an old summer palace to keep her quiet.

07:15.363 --> 07:18.654
She's turned it into one of those
exclusive la-di-da hotels

07:18.710 --> 07:21.893
where the nobs and nancies
come to squawk at each other.

07:21.992 --> 07:24.227
I can't stand it meself...
but she's good sort.

07:24.337 --> 07:28.170
Anyway, you'd better come with me.
We can sail tonight.

07:28.242 --> 07:30.065
Alas, messieur.

07:30.171 --> 07:34.087
Ever since I was a small boy...
I have suffered from le mal de mer.

07:36.232 --> 07:39.564
It needed all my courage
to make this small trip.

07:42.086 --> 07:45.098
I will take the train
and join you there.

07:51.948 --> 07:54.822
Mes compliments à messieur Jerome.

07:54.855 --> 07:55.896
Waiter?

07:59.225 --> 08:01.766
Could I have another brandy
and the bill, please?

08:01.879 --> 08:04.170
Patrick!
You haven't got time for another!

08:04.397 --> 08:06.938
- The steamer leaves at 11:00!
- Of course I have!

08:07.040 --> 08:09.622
You have the baggage sent down
while I wait for the changes.

08:09.748 --> 08:11.914
Why do I always have to do everything?

08:16.165 --> 08:20.290
Messieur Poirot, your reservation
on the night train has been confirmed.

08:20.620 --> 08:22.601
The tickets will be at the desk.

08:23.366 --> 08:24.906
Thank you. Er...

08:44.812 --> 08:49.019
I must go.
I've got to catch that damn boat

09:16.622 --> 09:19.370
What on earth's wrong, Rex?
You look fearfully glum.

09:19.497 --> 09:23.954
You're supposed to be enjoying yourself.
God knows you're paying enough for it!

09:24.081 --> 09:25.704
Don't I know it?

09:25.830 --> 09:29.996
As a matter of fact, Daphne...
I was wondering if you would care

09:30.122 --> 09:33.538
to trade my bill
for a super piece in New Yorker?

09:33.705 --> 09:37.789
You know the sort of thing.
"Farewell courtesan, hello inn-keeper."

09:37.955 --> 09:41.853
Darling, I'd love to help. But it's not
publicity I need, it's the cash.

09:42.036 --> 09:44.100
Oh, good God, darling, don't we all?

09:44.167 --> 09:46.125
How are the Gardeners this morning?

09:46.249 --> 09:50.457
Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale...
their infinite vulgarity.

09:50.930 --> 09:53.649
Good morning, Gardeners.
Everything tickety-boo?

09:53.706 --> 09:54.997
Good morning.

09:55.123 --> 09:58.361
Sure, Daphne.
But I could wish that my shower worked

09:58.470 --> 10:01.584
as snappily as the one that
I've got back home in New York City.

10:01.665 --> 10:04.539
Oh, you can't expect American plumbing
in the Adriatic.

10:04.579 --> 10:07.787
I guess not.
Well, at least we've got a shower.

10:07.834 --> 10:11.708
A cousin of Odell's was at
some place in Yugoslavia last year

10:11.757 --> 10:15.881
and had to wash in a kind of shack
in a field. Isn't that so, Odell?

10:16.045 --> 10:19.420
It wasn't my cousin, Myra...
it was my aunt.

10:19.749 --> 10:21.748
It was your cousin, Thelma Snatchball.

10:21.874 --> 10:24.457
OK, if you insist.
But there were two shacks.

10:24.889 --> 10:26.602
One for the guests
and one for the staff.

10:26.666 --> 10:28.832
It was very... stylish.

10:28.999 --> 10:32.335
Boat's coming in, Daphne.
Prepare to repel boarders.

10:34.331 --> 10:35.831
That'll be Arlena.

10:36.548 --> 10:38.215
Do you mean Arlena Stuart?

10:38.271 --> 10:41.312
No, Arlena Marshall.
She remarried a couple of months ago.

10:41.399 --> 10:45.439
Oh, good God, darling, I didn't know
she was coming. Oh, how marvellous!

10:45.574 --> 10:48.114
I am her greatest fan.
It will just make my vacation.

10:48.239 --> 10:52.071
Did any of you happen to see that
last show of hers, Hail and Farewell?

10:52.190 --> 10:57.107
Hail and farewell, I'll never tell
You've cast a spell over me...

10:57.333 --> 11:01.168
We produced it. Remember, dear?

11:01.503 --> 11:05.125
Oh, good God, darlings, I plumb forgot.

11:06.097 --> 11:09.804
Isn't that the one that
she walked out on after just three weeks

11:09.876 --> 11:11.584
and your biggest hit in years?

11:11.751 --> 11:14.042
You know damn well it was.

11:14.475 --> 11:17.626
And just what was that?
A sudden breakdown in health?

11:17.673 --> 11:20.789
More like a sudden attack of
gold digging.

11:21.537 --> 11:25.020
Which rather turned it into
"Sail and Farewell", eh?

11:26.293 --> 11:27.750
Funny man.

11:32.794 --> 11:37.227
Well, if that's Arlena, she must be
being dressed by Woolworths these days.

11:37.719 --> 11:43.385
Oh, that's the Redferns. Patrick
and Christine, I seem to remember.

11:43.461 --> 11:46.218
Excuse me, I must put my hostess hat on.

11:46.255 --> 11:49.588
Anyway, darlings...
it must have cost you a pretty bundle

11:49.627 --> 11:51.417
closing a hit show like that.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.585
Would either of you care to comment?

11:53.711 --> 11:55.627
Why don't you go and play with yourself?

11:55.846 --> 11:57.012
Excessively.

11:57.966 --> 12:01.586
Is coarseness a substitute for wit...
I ask myself.

12:03.174 --> 12:07.534
Hello! I'm Daphne Castle.
Welcome to the island.

12:07.645 --> 12:08.853
How do you do?

12:08.879 --> 12:11.070
Looks lovely. I'm sure
we'll have a nice time here.

12:11.131 --> 12:15.183
Oh. And a naughty one, too, I hope.

12:15.511 --> 12:18.010
- Would you care to sign in?
- Naughty?

12:18.375 --> 12:19.711
What are the holidays for...

12:20.022 --> 12:22.733
if you can't do a spot of flirting
and get a bit pissy boots?

12:22.797 --> 12:26.375
Quite right. Do you fancy a walk
around the island before lunch, dear?

12:26.650 --> 12:30.190
Patrick! You know perfectly well
that I've got a splitting headache

12:30.254 --> 12:31.940
and I've got all the unpacking to do.

12:31.974 --> 12:34.367
Andrea will show to your room,
if you like.

12:35.049 --> 12:36.505
Thank you.

12:36.546 --> 12:38.671
After two days
on that suffocating steamer

12:38.726 --> 12:41.758
I would have really thought that
you'd have more consideration for me.

12:42.343 --> 12:44.134
Anyway, I'm no good at...

13:19.751 --> 13:23.898
Thank you for those three hours
of pure and unadulterated hell.

13:25.936 --> 13:27.852
This may come as a nasty surprise
to you...

13:27.963 --> 13:32.712
but shock absorbers have been standard
on motorised vehicles for 30 years.

13:41.334 --> 13:43.715
Stop playing boules with my Vuitton!

13:43.972 --> 13:46.054
Linda, you gormless oaf, do something!

13:46.483 --> 13:47.774
Like what?

13:47.800 --> 13:50.076
Like stop them, cretin.

13:50.549 --> 13:52.174
Kenneth! This is a nightmare.

13:52.300 --> 13:54.590
Take it easy, Arlena.
We'll soon be there.

13:54.716 --> 13:56.590
Soon can't be soon enough for me.

13:56.716 --> 13:59.299
Of all the dreadful journeys...

14:02.526 --> 14:05.858
Isn't that the absurd little man
we saw in the station at Tirana?

14:05.913 --> 14:08.508
Pinched the only decent taxi
from under your nose.

14:08.547 --> 14:10.197
Yes, I do believe it is.

14:15.957 --> 14:17.035
Good morning.

14:17.093 --> 14:19.674
Since we are all obviously going
to Daphne's island...

14:19.801 --> 14:21.258
I'd better introduce myself.

14:21.426 --> 14:23.883
I'm Kenneth Marshall
and this is my wife, Arlena.

14:24.009 --> 14:26.705
- Hercule Poirot. Enchantée, madame.
- Charmed.

14:26.969 --> 14:28.922
This is my stepdaughter, Linda.

14:29.301 --> 14:33.214
Do stop standing there like a coughdrop
and say good morning to messieur Poirot.

14:33.337 --> 14:34.837
- Morning.
- Bonjour.

14:35.010 --> 14:38.176
Was your journey as frightful as ours,
messieur Poirot?

14:38.302 --> 14:41.471
Alas, I fear the sea
more than the land, madame.

14:42.177 --> 14:45.009
Oh, Mr Marshall,
I implore you not to spoil them.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.849
We have to pay double
on the way home.

14:47.809 --> 14:49.495
It's only a 20-minute boat trip.

14:49.552 --> 14:52.927
You'll find it all worthwhile
once we get to the island, I assure you.

14:53.052 --> 14:54.760
You mean you've been there before?

14:54.886 --> 14:57.510
Yes, I was there for a few days
three years ago.

14:57.636 --> 14:59.634
After the death of my first wife.

15:13.844 --> 15:15.052
God's teeth!

15:15.178 --> 15:17.912
Don't worry, darling.
It's only the noonday gun.

15:18.438 --> 15:20.021
The noonday gun?

15:20.178 --> 15:22.260
Yes, it's fired every day
at 12 o'clock

15:22.386 --> 15:26.810
to commemorate the glorious victory of
Kosovo-Metohija in 1193.

15:27.349 --> 15:31.303
I am reliably informed that
a mere handful of Tyranian cavalry

15:31.429 --> 15:35.442
routed over 50,000
barbarous Bosnian fanatics.

15:35.827 --> 15:38.611
The only military success
in their entire history.

15:38.658 --> 15:41.449
One success too many.

15:57.996 --> 16:01.162
Arlena! Arlena, darling, I love you!

16:25.435 --> 16:28.649
That tub was even more uncomfortable
than that damned taxi.

16:35.634 --> 16:38.347
What if the bitch
refuses to do the show?

16:38.397 --> 16:40.496
We'll lose all our backers, that's what.

16:40.556 --> 16:42.931
After all,
we sell the show on her name.

16:43.099 --> 16:47.056
To think our futures
are riding on that snake-eyed hussy!

16:55.344 --> 16:57.832
Welcome to the island,
everybody!

16:57.870 --> 17:01.609
Kenneth, oh, it's marvellous to see you!

17:01.839 --> 17:03.537
Absolutely marvellous.

17:04.193 --> 17:06.973
It must be at least two years
since you were last on the island.

17:07.061 --> 17:11.561
It's three, actually. Wonderful to be
here. You never met Linda, did you?

17:11.617 --> 17:13.128
No! No, I didn't.

17:13.191 --> 17:16.398
Hello! Hello, Linda.
Welcome to the island.

17:16.486 --> 17:19.702
And I don't think you know Arlena.

17:20.031 --> 17:23.698
Oh! Oh, yes. Yes, I do.

17:23.878 --> 17:26.295
Arlena and I are old sparring partners.

17:27.751 --> 17:29.666
Hello, Daphne.

17:31.527 --> 17:36.483
- Oh, it's been years.
- Well, a little time, yes.

17:37.240 --> 17:38.630
Years.

17:39.470 --> 17:42.422
Arlena and I were in
the chorus of a show together...

17:42.694 --> 17:44.652
not that I could ever compete.

17:44.864 --> 17:48.487
Even in those days, she could always
throw her legs up in the air

17:48.531 --> 17:50.864
higher than any of us...

17:51.059 --> 17:52.683
and wider.

17:53.635 --> 17:55.801
Kenneth, this is such a surprise.

17:55.976 --> 17:59.367
When you told me of an island
run by a quaint little landlady

17:59.435 --> 18:01.934
I had no idea it was Daphne Castle.

18:02.677 --> 18:06.336
Yes, quite. Daphne,
I wonder if we could go to our rooms.

18:06.372 --> 18:07.914
It's been a long journey.

18:08.095 --> 18:10.060
Oh. Certainly.

18:20.553 --> 18:22.283
Andreas!

18:24.269 --> 18:28.535
If you're short-staffed,
Kenneth can easily carry the bags.

18:28.728 --> 18:30.423
They'll be brought up in a minute.

18:30.543 --> 18:32.984
There'll be cocktails tonight
at eight o'clock.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.931
Do have a good, long, peaceful rest,
Arlena.

18:47.004 --> 18:53.026
You must be Sir Horace Blatt's friend.
Perhaps... Perhaps you'll sign in.

19:05.012 --> 19:07.567
Oh, so you're the famous
Hercule Poirot, eh?

19:08.585 --> 19:11.376
- You are too amiable, madame.
- Perhaps.

19:12.021 --> 19:15.521
I hope you haven't come to practise
your sleuthing games on my guests.

19:15.576 --> 19:18.408
They've all got far too many
skeletons in their cupboards

19:18.434 --> 19:20.058
to join in with enthusiasm.

19:20.766 --> 19:23.341
It's not my intention to derange
you or your guests, madame.

19:23.396 --> 19:26.479
Pendant les vacances
my desires are simply a good valet...

19:26.605 --> 19:30.021
a... tisane de menthe poivrée

19:30.047 --> 19:32.380
at eight o'clock in the morning
precisely...

19:32.406 --> 19:37.874
and of course some wax,
some beeswax for my shoes. That's all.

19:39.137 --> 19:42.845
Actually, Gilbert had nothing
to do with the success this season.

19:43.189 --> 19:46.855
Oh, my God, I really don't know
what we are going to do about them.

19:46.981 --> 19:50.688
I really do think that
the Millers have gone too far.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.147
Gilly is my oldest friend, Rex.

19:53.273 --> 19:54.605
Oh, God, I didn't know that!

19:54.731 --> 19:58.523
- Gilly is Myra's oldest friend.
- I just told him, Odell.

19:59.143 --> 20:02.189
Did you hear what Gilbert said
about the Queen?

20:02.315 --> 20:03.356
No.

20:03.482 --> 20:04.880
Well, you see...

20:15.565 --> 20:16.898
Enjoying it?

20:17.024 --> 20:21.440
I couldn't have one. This was
delicious, if I could... Thank you.

20:22.576 --> 20:24.689
How about a cocktail, messieur Poirot?

20:25.358 --> 20:28.190
White Lady, a Sidecar,
Mainbrace or Between the Sheets?

20:28.276 --> 20:32.484
No, if I could have a crème de Cassis
or a sirop de banane.

20:32.579 --> 20:36.786
- Do you have banana syrup?
- Certainly.

20:36.874 --> 20:38.488
Oh, my!

20:38.669 --> 20:41.251
I'm the last to arrive!

20:42.149 --> 20:44.273
Have a sausage, dear.

20:45.369 --> 20:48.494
You must be famished, having to wait
all that time in your room.

20:49.526 --> 20:53.638
Have you... Have you met the Redferns?
Christine and Patrick.

20:54.105 --> 20:58.017
- Arlena, darling...
- Arlena, my favourite leading lady!

20:58.682 --> 21:02.098
Why, if it isn't Odell and Myra!

21:02.317 --> 21:04.483
What on earth are you two doing here?

21:04.651 --> 21:07.900
It's wonderful to see you, Arlena.
We have a fabulous show for you.

21:08.026 --> 21:10.025
Oh, it's a real humdinger, honey!

21:10.151 --> 21:15.234
Odell insisted that we both come over
here together to see you personally.

21:15.360 --> 21:19.400
Well, it's very sweet of you.
But I'm sort of retired, you know.

21:19.527 --> 21:23.026
This is my new audience.
Have you met my husband?

21:23.151 --> 21:24.151
How do you do?

21:24.260 --> 21:27.620
How do you do? You'll change your mind.
You won't be able to resist this one!

21:27.667 --> 21:31.843
Keeler's mad to do it. But we're
holding her off until you have a look.

21:32.027 --> 21:34.193
And Kern,
he's done some of the best music...

21:34.319 --> 21:37.360
Arlena, darling, it's simply
sensational to see you again!

21:37.486 --> 21:40.110
- Hello, Rex.
- How do you do? I'm Kenneth Marshall...

21:40.236 --> 21:42.652
Excuse me.
I must talk to you, Arlena darling.

21:42.778 --> 21:44.972
Not now, Rexy-poo.

21:45.261 --> 21:46.636
Thank you.

21:46.903 --> 21:48.027
Cheers.

22:30.404 --> 22:33.987
Good morning, Linda.
How is your lovely mother?

22:34.113 --> 22:36.612
She's not lovely
and she's not my mother.

22:38.240 --> 22:41.114
Darling, didn't anyone ever tell you

22:41.280 --> 22:43.862
that peevishness is unbecoming
in young ladies?

22:43.988 --> 22:48.279
No. But they told me not to
talk to very strange men.

22:50.905 --> 22:52.196
Morning, Gardeners!

22:52.322 --> 22:54.987
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning, Arlena.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.394
I think it's gonna be a hot day.

23:02.496 --> 23:04.780
Good morning Mrs Redfern.

23:08.606 --> 23:11.064
Well, well, she's in wonderful shape.

23:11.128 --> 23:15.335
Yeah. How much was it we paid
Kleinfield, Klausewitz and Stummerhoppen

23:15.532 --> 23:18.155
to contest
that phoney doctor's certificate?

23:18.281 --> 23:20.135
$20,000.

23:21.351 --> 23:23.976
Arlena, darling,
you look quite divine in that outfit.

23:24.010 --> 23:26.051
Say no more. It's yours. Next question?

23:26.323 --> 23:28.405
There is something
frightfully important

23:28.573 --> 23:30.323
- I have to talk to you about.
- So talk.

23:30.378 --> 23:31.419
It's a bit private.

23:31.539 --> 23:34.288
You heard the little man, Linda.
Scram!

23:38.574 --> 23:40.115
Well, what is it?

23:40.428 --> 23:41.844
Arlena, I was wondering

23:41.908 --> 23:44.746
if you've had a chance to read
the proofs of the biography yet?

23:44.795 --> 23:47.252
Indeed I have, Rex.
I simply couldn't put it down.

23:47.574 --> 23:49.240
I knew you'd love it.

23:49.407 --> 23:54.615
What a busy bee you've been researching
exactly where I was born... and when.

23:54.741 --> 23:56.407
Well, there aren't too many stars

23:56.440 --> 23:59.063
were born in Tooting Bec
at the turn of the century.

23:59.089 --> 24:02.297
And the sweet way you wrote about
how I landed my first leading role

24:02.617 --> 24:05.741
in Flames of Eternity.
However did you find out?

24:05.867 --> 24:06.866
I bribed his wife.

24:06.924 --> 24:09.246
Naughty Rex!

24:09.325 --> 24:13.699
Ah, the days of my youth. But I've
shoved all that behind me now, Rex.

24:13.826 --> 24:16.426
Which is exactly what you're going to do
with your lousy book.

24:17.034 --> 24:19.950
But, Arlena darling, you promised.
When we were in New York.

24:20.076 --> 24:23.075
I've spent the advance.
I simply must have that release.

24:23.101 --> 24:24.069
Forget it.

24:24.095 --> 24:27.057
You're not going to barbecue me
to keep yourself in sailor suits.

24:28.616 --> 24:32.531
But, Arlena, angel, you must.

24:32.805 --> 24:36.345
I said forget it, I'm not going to
sign that release. And that's final.

24:39.535 --> 24:41.450
You're going to regret this, Arlena.

24:42.599 --> 24:44.033
That's a promise.

24:46.008 --> 24:49.909
Good morning, Mrs Marshall.
Good morning, Mr Brewster.

25:03.380 --> 25:04.463
Hello.

25:04.536 --> 25:05.535
Oh, hello.

25:05.661 --> 25:09.202
Oh, Linda, what are doing here?
Acting as chaperone, gooseberry or spy?

25:09.328 --> 25:12.536
I just wanted a chat.
I don't seem to be having much fun.

25:12.702 --> 25:15.536
If it's fun you're looking for,
go play with the jellyfish.

25:19.912 --> 25:22.947
Oh, my God!
She runs like a dromedary with dropsy.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.662
Bonjour, madame.

25:33.662 --> 25:34.702
Bitch!

25:37.412 --> 25:40.453
No, no, put me down!

25:43.621 --> 25:45.203
Put me down! No, no, no, no!

25:47.108 --> 25:49.524
I shall cry! I shall, I shall cry!

25:54.663 --> 25:59.502
You do not care for the aquatic sports
or the sunbathing, madame.

25:59.830 --> 26:04.029
I wish I could. But I don't go brown.
I sort of resemble a cassata.

26:04.135 --> 26:07.217
Pink skin, white blisters,
and green in the face.

26:07.476 --> 26:09.975
Unlike your husband, I observe.

26:10.015 --> 26:12.380
No, he manages those things rather well.

26:12.606 --> 26:15.438
Sometimes I think he must think
I'm an awful goose.

26:15.721 --> 26:18.678
But why, madame?
I do not indulge in those sports myself

26:18.704 --> 26:23.458
and yet I assure you,
I am very far from being... a goose.

26:23.518 --> 26:25.588
Ah, there you are, messieur Poirot.

26:38.129 --> 26:41.377
I've just had a telephone call
from your friend, Sir Horace.

26:41.581 --> 26:44.747
He says he's having trouble with his...
piffle valve?

26:45.591 --> 26:48.745
Ha! Such a valve still
has to be invented, madame.

26:48.854 --> 26:51.248
Well, I dare say you're right,
I wasn't paying attention.

26:51.374 --> 26:53.935
Anyway, the result is,
he'll be 24 hours late.

26:54.710 --> 26:56.175
Good morning, Kenneth.

27:02.528 --> 27:03.706
Are you going for a swim?

27:03.754 --> 27:06.283
The water is so hot,
the lobsters are coming out red.

27:06.624 --> 27:07.914
Good morning.

27:08.462 --> 27:11.295
Come along, Daddy, you promised
to come for a walk with me.

28:05.001 --> 28:09.126
Patrick... aren't you getting
a little tired of rowing?

28:20.336 --> 28:23.168
That was last night.
And this morning he starts all over...

28:23.294 --> 28:25.418
Andre... Andre... I don't care.

28:25.483 --> 28:27.974
I don't care if messieur Poirot
wants cement on his sausages

28:28.034 --> 28:30.492
or boot-blacking on his butter,
just give it to him!

28:30.821 --> 28:34.164
That finicky little Belgian fart
will find it all on his bill anyhow.

28:35.581 --> 28:37.914
- With a vengeance!
- Very well, madame.

28:43.455 --> 28:48.361
I'm so sorry. Are we late? Patrick
insisted he row me around the island.

28:48.463 --> 28:50.794
It's bigger than I thought.
Poor darling, he's exhausted.

28:50.920 --> 28:52.461
Not in the least surprised.

28:52.511 --> 28:54.719
I'm sorry we didn't take you with us,
my dear.

28:54.830 --> 28:58.245
The sun would have been
much too strong for you. You know that.

29:02.612 --> 29:05.736
Arlena, here you are,
it's the script that I promised you.

29:05.887 --> 29:08.951
No, I thought I told you last night.
I've given up the theatre.

29:09.174 --> 29:11.923
These two are all
I'm concerned with now.

29:13.246 --> 29:16.927
- What's it called anyway?
- It's Not Right And It's Not Fair.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.050
Sounds like a black man's left leg.

30:43.092 --> 30:47.001
- It's alright, Mr Poirot.
- Pardon, madame. Je m'excuse.

30:48.008 --> 30:49.091
Please stay.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.782
I'm just being silly.

30:56.300 --> 31:00.341
I wish I had more self-control,
didn't show what I feel.

31:02.051 --> 31:04.758
Well, that is sometimes
not easy for the ladies.

31:05.801 --> 31:08.384
Do you know what I am most sick of
in this place?

31:08.509 --> 31:10.092
- What, madame?
- Pity.

31:10.260 --> 31:11.883
I can't bear to be pitied.

31:13.063 --> 31:16.120
Everyone round here
seems to feel so sorry for me.

31:16.366 --> 31:19.073
I can tell it
by the way they look at me.

31:19.238 --> 31:21.662
"Poor little thing," they're saying.

31:22.051 --> 31:25.299
"What she has to put up with, with
that poor fool of a husband of hers."

31:26.010 --> 31:29.093
"What a pity she's not strong enough
to compete for what she wants."

31:30.292 --> 31:33.073
Will you allow me to tell you something,
madame?

31:34.046 --> 31:37.045
The Arlena Stuarts of this world
do not count.

31:37.117 --> 31:39.575
Their domination is of the moment.

31:40.300 --> 31:45.927
Really, to count, a woman
must have either goodness or brains.

31:46.052 --> 31:50.260
You can't actually believe that men care
for either of those things, can you?

31:50.386 --> 31:52.177
Oh, yes, I do, madame.

31:53.058 --> 31:55.123
Your husband loves you.

31:56.053 --> 31:57.469
I know that.

31:59.928 --> 32:03.219
Come, let us take a little promenade.
Hmm?

32:22.068 --> 32:25.442
How I wish I could do that,
just lie in the sun.

32:25.885 --> 32:27.378
Mais pourquoi, madame?

32:27.416 --> 32:31.026
Look at them lying in rows,
like corpses in the morgue!

32:31.259 --> 32:34.312
They are not men and women.
Nothing personal about them.

32:34.356 --> 32:38.814
They're just bodies, butcher's meat,
steaks grilling in the sun.

32:41.422 --> 32:45.187
I'm sorry, Mr Poirot,
I suffer from vertigo.

32:45.383 --> 32:47.466
I can't bear to look down from a height.

32:48.294 --> 32:51.668
I'm better now.
In fact I am determined to enjoy myself.

32:52.427 --> 32:57.820
It's so blissful here, so tranquil,
so far from all violence and trouble.

32:59.915 --> 33:01.580
Yes, you are right, madame.

33:02.354 --> 33:05.180
The sky is blue, the sun is shining...

33:05.306 --> 33:11.847
and yet you forget that everywhere
there is evil under the sun.

33:41.408 --> 33:43.361
You're going to be late for dinner,
you know.

33:43.505 --> 33:45.379
Yes, I know.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.474
Just having a bit of a think.

33:48.068 --> 33:49.483
About Arlena?

33:51.457 --> 33:53.961
I suppose it's no use
saying it's your own fault.

33:54.799 --> 33:57.535
- Not much...
- No, it never is.

33:58.573 --> 34:01.307
How about, "You've made your bed,
now you must lie on it"?

34:01.433 --> 34:03.577
- Worse.
- Thought it might be.

34:05.142 --> 34:08.266
- Poor Kenneth. You do pick 'em.
- Oh, I can cope.

34:08.433 --> 34:10.850
- Do you think Linda can?
- What do you mean?

34:11.436 --> 34:14.947
She's always on at that poor child,
bitching the hell out of her.

34:15.478 --> 34:17.768
Yes. Yes, a pity about that.

34:17.827 --> 34:21.902
Linda's like... like her mother,
you see, she takes things hard.

34:22.300 --> 34:25.007
- Why don't you do something about it?
- Like what?

34:25.110 --> 34:28.360
Like fixing up a divorce, for instance.
People do it all the time.

34:28.643 --> 34:31.391
With most of my friends
it's a full-time occupation.

34:31.518 --> 34:34.684
Arlena's alright.
She just adores to flirt, that's all.

34:34.810 --> 34:37.516
There's nothing in it.
It's all on the spur of the moment.

34:37.685 --> 34:41.641
Spur of the moment?
You really are blind.

34:41.996 --> 34:46.455
Who the hell do you think booked Patrick
Redfern in here in the first place?

34:47.257 --> 34:48.931
You don't mean...?

34:50.966 --> 34:52.311
I'm afraid so.

34:55.518 --> 34:58.643
Even so. With me, a deal is a deal.

34:58.769 --> 35:01.476
I don't approve of quick marriage
and easy divorce.

35:01.526 --> 35:04.192
Arlena is my wife.
That's all there is to it.

35:05.352 --> 35:07.102
Till death do you part?

35:09.423 --> 35:10.463
Exactly.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.296
I see.

35:23.097 --> 35:24.356
Well?

35:29.918 --> 35:32.126
I could just kill that cow!

35:38.088 --> 35:41.059
Well, what the hell do we do now, Odell?

35:41.187 --> 35:42.854
Just leave it to me.

35:43.896 --> 35:47.319
- I'll think of something.
- Hm! My hero.

35:47.813 --> 35:52.104
I swear, if you were a man,
I would divorce you.

35:55.639 --> 35:58.863
Hello, darling! You'd better get
a move on. Where have you been?

35:59.875 --> 36:02.124
I've just been having a word
with Daphne.

36:02.188 --> 36:05.437
You get on like a house on fire
with her, don't you?

36:05.780 --> 36:07.104
She's a nice lady.

36:07.139 --> 36:12.388
Yes, I suppose she is.
As hotel proprietors go.

36:16.480 --> 36:19.813
And you get on rather well with Redfern,
don't you?

36:20.679 --> 36:22.000
He's a nice fellow.

36:22.298 --> 36:25.846
Yes, I suppose he is, as gigolos go.

36:26.344 --> 36:27.977
What's that supposed to mean?

36:28.397 --> 36:30.895
You liked him well enough
when you met him in London.

36:31.055 --> 36:32.805
I never set eyes on the man before.

36:33.064 --> 36:36.359
Really?
I could have sworn you were there.

36:36.637 --> 36:38.928
It must have been
your regimental dinner.

36:39.094 --> 36:40.842
Well, anyway, what does it matter?

36:41.023 --> 36:43.897
He just happens to be a guest here
who took me for a boat ride.

36:43.929 --> 36:46.512
He just happens to be a guest here,
Arlena...

36:47.011 --> 36:49.040
because you just happened
to book him in.

36:50.065 --> 36:52.397
The bitch Daphne!

36:57.705 --> 37:00.051
Christine,
I refuse to talk about it!

37:00.211 --> 37:03.002
That's rich!
You don't want to talk about it?

37:03.066 --> 37:06.395
Look here,
I can't even speak to a woman

37:06.458 --> 37:09.149
without you jumping to the conclusion
that I'm having an affair!

37:09.275 --> 37:12.524
Aren't you? You leave me
here alone and go off with her.

37:12.649 --> 37:14.440
I'm the laughing stock of the hotel.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.898
Of course you're not!
How ridiculous!

37:16.988 --> 37:19.362
Arlena and I are just good friends,
that's all!

37:19.504 --> 37:22.461
I don't believe you!
Please, let's just go away.

37:22.525 --> 37:25.441
I absolutely refuse.
Here we are and here we stay!

37:25.481 --> 37:28.022
- If you don't like it you can...
- Yes, what can I do?

37:35.067 --> 37:38.826
Well, I'm looking forward to having
a nice little chat with you, Patrick.

37:39.442 --> 37:41.731
Oh, Myra, that is so beautiful.

37:41.758 --> 37:43.964
- How's your drink?
- Incredible.

37:49.071 --> 37:51.630
How are you?

37:52.858 --> 37:54.346
Too much sun?

38:20.018 --> 38:21.119
Good!

38:21.150 --> 38:24.958
That's enough, Linda.
It's adult time. Off to bed.

38:25.194 --> 38:28.193
Come on, darling. Let her stay.
She is on holiday after all.

38:28.224 --> 38:30.057
Scram, Cinderella.

38:35.803 --> 38:40.844
You're the top

38:42.902 --> 38:45.318
You're the Colosseum

38:46.404 --> 38:48.194
You're the top

38:49.746 --> 38:51.614
You're the Louvre Museum

38:52.911 --> 38:57.036
You're the nimble tread
Of the feet of Fred Astaire

38:57.279 --> 38:59.820
You're the National Gallery
You're Garbo's salary

38:59.946 --> 39:02.486
You're camembert

39:04.510 --> 39:07.801
You're the Nile

39:07.903 --> 39:10.153
You're the Tower of Pisa

39:11.238 --> 39:17.448
You're the smile on the Mona Lisa

39:18.134 --> 39:22.770
I'm a worthless cheque, a total wreck
A flop

39:23.037 --> 39:27.536
But if, baby, I'm the bottom
You're the top

39:31.007 --> 39:32.463
You're the top

39:34.151 --> 39:36.796
You're a new invention

39:37.707 --> 39:38.790
You're the top

39:40.864 --> 39:44.530
You're the fourth dimension

39:45.424 --> 39:51.214
I'm a frog without a log
on which to hop

39:52.338 --> 39:56.041
But if, baby, I'm the bottom

39:56.168 --> 39:58.297
- Sorry.
- You're the top

40:04.874 --> 40:06.123
That was terrific!

40:06.194 --> 40:08.277
Isn't she wonderful?

40:08.677 --> 40:10.824
Wonderful! Wonderful!

40:31.175 --> 40:32.758
Mademoiselle!

40:57.721 --> 41:00.854
Abracadabra!

41:05.235 --> 41:06.941
I know how you did that.

41:07.576 --> 41:09.117
The egg's in your top pocket.

41:11.106 --> 41:13.037
I'm not five years old, you know.

41:22.383 --> 41:25.549
- Been for a bathe, darling?
- What's it look like?

41:25.636 --> 41:28.760
Darling, there is no need to be snappy

41:28.863 --> 41:32.160
just because you went to bed
bright and early last night.

41:42.855 --> 41:44.866
I always keep mine behind my ear.

41:46.035 --> 41:47.201
What?

41:56.330 --> 41:59.415
Oh, there you are!
I was looking for you.

41:59.898 --> 42:02.494
I'm going sketching at Gull Cove.
Would you like to come?

42:02.607 --> 42:04.011
Yes, I'd love to.

42:04.078 --> 42:05.994
I'll see you down in the hall
in ten minutes.

42:07.795 --> 42:09.544
Ah, hello, Mr Poirot.

42:37.382 --> 42:41.037
Messieur Poirot, just the man!

42:41.147 --> 42:44.438
Would you be very kind
and help me push this out?

42:44.905 --> 42:47.342
You require assistance, madame?

42:49.051 --> 42:51.346
It's like trying to launch
the Mauritania.

42:51.661 --> 42:53.874
Without the Champagne!

42:59.111 --> 43:01.343
Thank you so much. Oh...

43:01.400 --> 43:05.608
And, messieur Poirot, please
don't tell anyone where I've gone.

43:05.656 --> 43:09.031
- Everyone will keep following me about.
- Everyone, madame?

43:09.657 --> 43:13.520
Perhaps some people more than others,
but I just want to be alone.

43:14.602 --> 43:16.809
- Voilà.
- Enjoy your swim.

44:04.791 --> 44:08.249
There she goes.
Not a care in the world!

44:08.375 --> 44:09.583
I'll make her care.

44:09.624 --> 44:12.206
Oh, what do you know about care?
If it'd been up to you...

44:12.262 --> 44:15.242
the good Samaritan would've passed by
on the other side.

44:15.307 --> 44:17.223
I have an idea,
but I need to work it out.

44:17.363 --> 44:20.238
Well, don't forget about my cousin,
Hatty Heimenheimer.

44:20.458 --> 44:23.041
It took her so long
to "work out an idea"...

44:23.168 --> 44:26.404
they finally had to stash her away
in the booby hatch!

44:26.955 --> 44:28.105
Odell?

44:33.256 --> 44:34.614
Odell!

44:48.866 --> 44:51.544
- Hey, hey, hey. Where's the fire?
- Sorry.

44:52.213 --> 44:54.798
- Have you had your breakfast?
- Had a piece of toast.

44:56.304 --> 44:58.293
Linda, you really are naughty.

44:58.576 --> 45:01.979
Andreas goes to all the trouble of
preparing decent English breakfasts

45:02.194 --> 45:07.028
instead of those weedy
continental things and you eat toast.

45:07.295 --> 45:09.073
I'm sorry, I just wasn't hungry.

45:11.168 --> 45:12.292
What's the matter?

45:14.471 --> 45:15.637
Is it Arlena?

45:16.670 --> 45:21.502
- She's so beastly.
- You don't want to worry about her.

45:22.606 --> 45:24.768
Things have a habit of working out.

45:25.045 --> 45:27.294
- I promise you.
- Yes, if you make them.

45:27.859 --> 45:30.692
Would you like to come for a stroll
to the lighthouse?

45:31.068 --> 45:34.057
This must be my lucky day.
I've never been in such demand.

45:34.414 --> 45:35.830
I'd like to, but I can't.

45:36.004 --> 45:38.420
I've got a date
to go sketching with Christine.

45:38.825 --> 45:41.542
That's alright.
I'm glad to see you're making friends.

45:43.485 --> 45:46.491
- Good morning, Kenneth.
- Ah, good morning.

45:47.079 --> 45:48.203
Morning, darling.

45:48.313 --> 45:51.143
There's a letter for you.
The boatman brought it over.

45:51.254 --> 45:52.485
Ah, thank you.

45:52.778 --> 45:55.110
Seeing your daughter
has just turned me down...

45:55.174 --> 45:58.923
would you like to come for a walk with
me, before my staff meeting at 11:30?

45:59.150 --> 46:03.537
I'd love to, but I'm afraid I can't.
This must be answered straight away.

46:04.255 --> 46:06.128
This isn't my lucky day, Linda.

46:06.189 --> 46:10.593
You can't get away from me at 12:30.
We're playing tennis. Remember?

46:10.682 --> 46:11.560
I remember.

46:12.864 --> 46:15.059
By the way, Linda,
have you seen your mother?

46:15.123 --> 46:17.961
- No, thank God.
- Linda, I won't tell you again...

46:18.505 --> 46:22.462
Clean it, clean it.
Don't just lean on the thing.

46:26.990 --> 46:28.573
Here we all are.

46:29.800 --> 46:34.054
Well... Well, what a...
colourful outfit!

46:34.345 --> 46:37.053
Oh! Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

46:37.334 --> 46:40.042
Linda and I
are going off sketching, Mr Marshall.

46:40.098 --> 46:43.972
Don't worry, I'll take good care of her.
See you on the tennis courts at 12:30.

46:44.027 --> 46:45.943
- Bye, Daddy.
- Have a nice time.

46:49.110 --> 46:51.483
Morning, Poirot. Been swimming?

46:51.951 --> 46:53.836
- You saw me?
- No.

46:53.923 --> 46:55.881
Yes, I have been swimming!

46:56.007 --> 46:59.423
There's nothing like the shock of
cold water and rhythmic movement

46:59.549 --> 47:01.684
to stimulate the little grey cells.

47:01.716 --> 47:05.064
Yes, of course. I don't suppose
you've seen my wife about, have you?

47:06.014 --> 47:07.701
- Madame Marshall?
- Hmm.

47:08.465 --> 47:11.995
- What, she rose so early?
- She's not in our rooms.

47:13.245 --> 47:16.256
Oh, by the way, I was looking for
that fellow Redfern earlier.

47:16.282 --> 47:18.067
I don't suppose you've seen him?

47:18.391 --> 47:19.987
Is someone taking my name in vain?

47:21.947 --> 47:24.072
A very good morning to you, gentlemen.

47:39.142 --> 47:41.133
What kind of paintings do you do,
Mrs Redfern?

47:41.259 --> 47:43.341
- Call me Christine.
- Thank you.

50:18.974 --> 50:21.015
Hi, Patrick! Going for a spin?

50:22.974 --> 50:24.681
How about taking me along?

50:25.804 --> 50:27.478
Er... well...

50:44.559 --> 50:45.975
What time is it, dear?

50:49.184 --> 50:50.183
Five to 12.

50:50.394 --> 50:52.519
Lord, I must fly.

50:52.850 --> 50:54.641
I'm playing tennis at 12:30.

51:12.943 --> 51:14.559
That's a fine boat!

51:14.684 --> 51:16.962
I think it belongs to Sir Horace Blatt.

51:17.809 --> 51:21.435
Odell and I were on it once, I think.

51:30.977 --> 51:34.063
Look. I wonder who that is.

51:34.852 --> 51:38.223
You know exactly who it is,
you naughty boy!

51:38.643 --> 51:40.684
Would you be a sport
and take the boat back?

51:40.810 --> 51:42.685
I'll come back with Arlena, I'll walk.

51:42.810 --> 51:45.810
Are you kidding?
I don't know how to work this thing.

51:45.935 --> 51:48.185
Look, it's simple,
this lever puts you in gear

51:48.352 --> 51:49.935
and all you have to do is steer.

51:50.061 --> 51:53.310
Well, just this once.
But don't get me involved.

51:53.436 --> 51:55.102
You're a sport.

52:09.562 --> 52:10.977
Boo!

52:11.103 --> 52:12.603
Hey, come on, wake up!

52:27.723 --> 52:28.764
Oh, my God!

52:30.311 --> 52:31.810
What's the matter?

52:32.382 --> 52:33.620
She's dead!

52:34.638 --> 52:36.008
She's been murdered!

52:37.364 --> 52:39.363
- Strangled!
- Strangled?

52:41.632 --> 52:44.914
- It's just not possible.
- We'd better get some help!

52:45.920 --> 52:50.377
- I'll go. You'll stay with the body.
- Are you kidding? I can't do that!

52:50.605 --> 52:53.952
You're right. The murderer
may still be about somewhere.

52:54.387 --> 52:57.927
- Can you make it back to the hotel?
- In a flash. This thing's no problem.

52:58.021 --> 52:59.646
You'd better hurry!

53:17.851 --> 53:20.035
Madame Marshall
has been strangled.

53:20.341 --> 53:25.606
There are contusion marks on the head
and the neck. This much is evident.

53:26.899 --> 53:28.522
We must now send for the police

53:28.648 --> 53:32.231
and acquire a doctor
in order to establish the time of death.

53:32.356 --> 53:35.440
Have you ever met a Tyranian doctor,
messieur Poirot?

53:35.565 --> 53:39.647
The limit of their skill is determining
the fitness of an ox to pull a cart.

53:39.850 --> 53:42.642
That may be so, madame, but...

53:42.691 --> 53:46.863
Dear messieur Poirot,
a word in your ear.

53:47.524 --> 53:51.920
The whole world knows that you are a man
of enormous discretion and gallantry...

53:52.139 --> 53:55.682
a man not only privy to the secrets of
kings and prime ministers...

53:55.784 --> 53:59.686
but also a man who would never willingly
stand by and see a lady in trouble

53:59.724 --> 54:01.098
without rushing to her aid.

54:01.140 --> 54:04.424
I appeal to you now, as just such
a frail woman, in need of help.

54:04.473 --> 54:06.874
In fact I throw myself on your mercy.

54:06.978 --> 54:10.238
Couldn't we make this
a private investigation?

54:10.275 --> 54:13.407
You know how peculiar people can be
about a spot of murder.

54:14.867 --> 54:17.035
The scandal of a famous stage star...

54:17.551 --> 54:20.010
being murdered here
would ruin my hotel.

54:22.109 --> 54:23.320
I'm very sorry, madame...

54:23.359 --> 54:26.004
but there is no way to
avoid this becoming...

54:26.371 --> 54:28.457
an official matter.

54:29.002 --> 54:32.576
In due course of time,
of course I quite agree...

54:32.735 --> 54:35.136
when it can be released
in the proper manner.

54:35.323 --> 54:38.984
But consider, just think what everyone
will say if they were to discover

54:39.109 --> 54:41.239
that you were here
ahead of the police...

54:41.896 --> 54:44.699
and failed to solve the crime.

54:46.580 --> 54:50.579
I mean, messieur Poirot,
both our reputations are at stake.

54:55.022 --> 54:57.604
I bet it pongs something rotten
in there.

54:57.676 --> 55:00.591
Only of the breath of the sea.

55:00.944 --> 55:03.735
Oh, how poetic you are, messieur Poirot.

55:04.319 --> 55:07.355
You have the true soul of France.

55:07.715 --> 55:09.579
The true soul of Belgium, madame.

55:09.691 --> 55:12.690
Yes, of course.
How mortifyingly stupid of me!

55:12.755 --> 55:16.337
- Oh, do please forgive me.
- In due course of time.

55:17.387 --> 55:19.195
What do you say, messieur?

55:20.148 --> 55:24.089
Will you bring your colossal brain power
to the aid of a lady in distress?

55:24.723 --> 55:26.764
Will you clear up this hideous mess
for me

55:26.820 --> 55:31.527
with all the brilliance and discretion
for which you are world famous?

55:31.553 --> 55:35.617
One moment, madame. I must carry out
a little investigation of my own

55:35.653 --> 55:37.736
before answering your question.

55:38.545 --> 55:39.980
Messieur Redfern.

55:40.160 --> 55:43.157
At what time did you
and Madame Gardener find the body?

55:43.404 --> 55:45.153
It was 12 o'clock exactly.

55:45.318 --> 55:48.128
That bloody gun went off as we
were coming round these rocks there.

55:48.662 --> 55:51.037
I sent Mrs Gardener back
for help immediately.

55:51.192 --> 55:53.584
I touched nothing except
to check she was dead.

55:53.638 --> 55:55.660
Oh, yes, you acted quite correctly.

55:56.121 --> 55:59.809
Well, since I was the last person
to see Madame Marshall alive...

55:59.905 --> 56:05.866
when I pushed her off in her pedalo at
about 10:20, it means the time of death

56:05.959 --> 56:10.237
can be established as being
between 10:30 and 12 noon.

56:11.186 --> 56:13.936
How absolutely brilliant!

56:15.066 --> 56:17.773
A doctor after all could only give us
an approximate time

56:18.072 --> 56:22.905
and how she was killed, which I know.
I don't need the help of a doctor.

56:23.626 --> 56:25.168
Messieurs!

56:48.817 --> 56:51.951
It's a terrible tragedy, Poirot.
It's terrible.

56:54.146 --> 56:58.813
She may have been a bit flighty, Arlena,
but no one would've wished this on her.

57:00.032 --> 57:01.281
Just between ourselves...

57:01.407 --> 57:04.239
you may have guessed,
but she was the lady in question.

57:04.365 --> 57:08.907
- That was not too difficult to guess.
- I suppose it bloody wasn't.

57:09.925 --> 57:14.034
Well, I'd best chalk it all up
to experience and be on me way.

57:14.116 --> 57:18.100
There's no point in intruding
in the grief of the new husband

57:18.208 --> 57:19.457
and all that sort of thing.

57:19.583 --> 57:22.300
You had no chance
to speak to Madame Arlena?

57:23.549 --> 57:26.233
Of course not.
I've only just arrived, haven't I?

57:26.259 --> 57:27.675
Yes, of course.

57:27.731 --> 57:30.690
There's only one thing
that puzzles me in that case.

57:31.452 --> 57:34.780
You remember the false diamond
I left in your possession?

57:35.193 --> 57:36.060
Yes.

57:36.091 --> 57:40.603
How did I happen to find it once again
on the beach near the dead woman?

57:46.836 --> 57:49.953
Oh, dammit, Poirot.
I'd make a right murderer, wouldn't I?

57:50.002 --> 57:52.042
Leaving clues all over the place, eh?

57:53.683 --> 57:56.673
- Alright, I confess
- You confess?

57:56.707 --> 57:59.756
I mean I confess I had a word with her.

58:00.121 --> 58:04.454
I was coming in on the boat and I saw
Arlena on one of them pedal things

58:04.494 --> 58:06.534
going into a beach along there.

58:06.584 --> 58:09.416
Anyway, I stopped the boat
and I rowed meself over.

58:11.401 --> 58:14.570
It's better than confronting her
in front of her husband, you know.

58:15.065 --> 58:19.121
We had a bit of a barney, what with her
pretending to be all surprised and that.

58:19.736 --> 58:22.585
Anyroad, she promised to sort it out
by tonight.

58:22.650 --> 58:25.520
She did not tell you
where the real jewel was?

58:25.844 --> 58:27.456
No, dammit, she didn't.

58:27.756 --> 58:30.256
If you don't mind,
I'd like to get changed.

58:30.320 --> 58:32.891
I'm getting a little chilly,
what with the shock and everything.

58:33.784 --> 58:36.654
I was very fond of Arlena,
as you well know.

58:36.886 --> 58:39.135
Yes, you may well have been, messieur.

58:39.346 --> 58:42.762
And yet there are cases of men
that have killed those women

58:43.060 --> 58:47.768
who made it impossible for them to
return to the wives they really loved.

58:47.854 --> 58:50.117
Well, I assure you,
that is not the case here.

58:50.261 --> 58:52.115
I could have taken off
at any time I wanted.

58:52.629 --> 58:54.394
Anyway you know I had
nothing to do with it.

58:54.970 --> 58:58.515
You yourself saw me from the terrace
go off in the boat with Mrs Gardener.

58:59.004 --> 59:00.587
Oui, c'est exacte.

59:00.970 --> 59:04.674
It would seem
that I am your alibi, messieur.

59:05.352 --> 59:06.984
Please go and get changed.

59:11.672 --> 59:15.203
So, that young man's been
sniffing round Arlena, has he?

59:15.855 --> 59:17.318
Can't say I blame him.

59:17.676 --> 59:20.842
I'm sorry, Sir Horace,
but it's my duty to put it to you

59:20.882 --> 59:23.090
that you were furious
with Madame Arlena...

59:23.395 --> 59:25.811
that you were determined
to get your jewel back...

59:25.839 --> 59:27.921
you came up here in order to demand it.

59:28.131 --> 59:29.767
She laughed in your face.

59:29.811 --> 59:32.977
You lost your temper,
you strangled her...

59:33.049 --> 59:35.714
That is poppycock!
That is bloody poppycock!

59:35.770 --> 59:37.346
If it is poppycock...

59:37.985 --> 59:40.826
then it's most regrettable
that you said in front of me

59:40.872 --> 59:43.995
that you would willingly
"wring her neck".

59:45.359 --> 59:48.567
Oh, that were...
That was just a bit of chat, that's all.

59:51.972 --> 59:56.379
Look. All I did was tell her that
she couldn't make a monkey out of me

59:56.412 --> 59:57.904
and I threw that bit of glass at her.

59:58.855 --> 01:00:01.664
Look, if I had killed her, my crew
would have seen me, wouldn't they?

01:00:01.690 --> 01:00:03.718
They were all on deck, watching.

01:00:03.747 --> 01:00:06.455
Not averse to clocking
a decent bit of crumpet, my lads.

01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:08.198
It's the only thing that wakes them up.

01:00:08.265 --> 01:00:10.431
So, if you don't believe me, ask them.

01:00:12.538 --> 01:00:16.956
Très bien. All the same, I must ask you
not to leave the island for the moment.

01:00:18.090 --> 01:00:19.375
If you insist.

01:00:19.444 --> 01:00:25.027
But if I were you, Poirot,
I would cherchez le hubby.

01:00:27.129 --> 01:00:30.482
You'll find they're favourite when
dealing with the Arlenas of this world.

01:00:38.489 --> 01:00:41.307
It's a little difficult to accept
your condolences, Poirot...

01:00:41.926 --> 01:00:44.675
when in the same breath
you accuse me of murdering my wife

01:00:44.722 --> 01:00:45.881
because she was unfaithful.

01:00:45.939 --> 01:00:48.051
I can understand that, of course.

01:00:48.201 --> 01:00:50.950
But I hope you realise that
I'm rather easier to get on with

01:00:51.005 --> 01:00:53.795
than the Tyranian police would be.

01:00:53.929 --> 01:00:55.345
And therefore I will ask you

01:00:55.404 --> 01:00:58.695
where you were between
11:00 and 12:00 this morning.

01:00:59.124 --> 01:01:00.749
Very simple. I was in here typing.

01:01:00.863 --> 01:01:02.925
I changed for tennis
a few minutes after 12:00.

01:01:03.073 --> 01:01:04.767
How very curious.

01:01:04.916 --> 01:01:11.370
Because, you know, when I passed by your
door at what must have been about 11:15...

01:01:11.915 --> 01:01:14.086
- I heard no sound.
- I can't help that.

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:17.247
One does occasionally pause to think,
you know.

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:21.946
Here. This is what I typed.

01:01:22.551 --> 01:01:24.953
As you can see, it would have taken
at least an hour to do.

01:01:25.126 --> 01:01:28.199
With respect messieur, you could've typed
that yesterday, brougt it in with you.

01:01:28.363 --> 01:01:30.821
There's no proof
that you typed it this morning.

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.945
Excuse me, messieur Poirot...

01:01:33.005 --> 01:01:36.605
I just couldn't help overhearing.
I have the proof you need.

01:01:37.015 --> 01:01:38.806
- You do, madame?
- Yes.

01:01:39.005 --> 01:01:42.254
Every week it's my custom
to collect all my staff together...

01:01:42.258 --> 01:01:44.090
give them a collective
boot up the bum.

01:01:44.099 --> 01:01:47.015
It does no end of good,
particularly the Eyeties.

01:01:47.265 --> 01:01:50.248
Keeps them up to snuff,
as my old papa used to say.

01:01:50.249 --> 01:01:52.988
Anyway, that meeting was this morning
at 11:30...

01:01:53.017 --> 01:01:56.469
and just before it I came up here to
have a wash and I poked my nose in here

01:01:56.497 --> 01:02:00.333
and I saw Kenneth hard at it,
so I... I just didn't disturb him.

01:02:01.654 --> 01:02:05.078
But, madame,
you cannot see the desk from the door.

01:02:10.475 --> 01:02:12.501
I saw him in the mirror.

01:02:14.386 --> 01:02:16.029
In the mir...

01:02:16.725 --> 01:02:18.050
Oh, in the mirror!

01:02:25.423 --> 01:02:27.671
My goodness, you do type fast, Ken.

01:02:27.845 --> 01:02:30.218
You must be the Horowitz of
the Remington.

01:02:31.983 --> 01:02:35.066
Tell me, madame,
how many fingers am I holding up?

01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.527
Three.

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:44.516
Yes. And now how many?

01:02:50.786 --> 01:02:53.589
Well, that...
that's not fair, you're hiding.

01:02:53.647 --> 01:02:56.703
You cannot see in the mirror
someone seated at the desk.

01:02:56.704 --> 01:03:00.387
It is not me that is hiding,
it is you who are lying.

01:03:01.436 --> 01:03:06.803
Now, messieur Marshall, are you,
by any chance, lying also?

01:03:07.102 --> 01:03:10.994
It should be fairly obvious, Poirot,
that that letter, all eight pages of it...

01:03:11.074 --> 01:03:13.561
is in reply to this one
from my stockbroker...

01:03:13.642 --> 01:03:16.691
which arrived by this morning's post
at about 10:30.

01:03:17.301 --> 01:03:19.236
It should, therefore, be equally obvious

01:03:19.237 --> 01:03:21.617
that I must have typed it
when I said I did.

01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.637
Yes, it would appear so.

01:03:25.346 --> 01:03:27.298
Now to revert to
you again, madame.

01:03:27.728 --> 01:03:29.417
I would like to ask
you a question

01:03:29.418 --> 01:03:32.379
about your promenade
to the lighthouse this morning.

01:03:32.382 --> 01:03:33.925
You went alone, I believe?

01:03:34.347 --> 01:03:35.720
Yes, I did.

01:03:36.017 --> 01:03:40.396
And you must have passed the bay
on which Arlena was murdered?

01:03:41.221 --> 01:03:45.406
Yes. Yes, I did.
I also saw Arlena sunning herself.

01:03:45.596 --> 01:03:46.518
Oh!

01:03:47.607 --> 01:03:50.231
But then you must have
taken the same path home.

01:03:50.270 --> 01:03:52.602
There is no logical alternative.

01:03:52.831 --> 01:03:54.746
And I am suggesting to you...

01:03:54.772 --> 01:03:56.979
you could have gone down to the beach...

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:59.167
murdered Arlena Marshall

01:03:59.204 --> 01:04:03.834
and still been in time
for your staff meeting at 11:30.

01:04:04.103 --> 01:04:07.899
What utter balderdash! You can't
possibly think I'd want to kill Arlena

01:04:07.977 --> 01:04:10.789
just because the silly cow
succeeded on the boards and I didn't.

01:04:11.228 --> 01:04:12.965
No, that I do not think.

01:04:12.972 --> 01:04:16.798
But there is a certain tenderness
between you and messieur Marshall.

01:04:16.863 --> 01:04:20.653
Otherwise why take that absurd risk
of trying to protect him just now?

01:04:20.704 --> 01:04:22.964
What if there is? What does it matter?

01:04:23.131 --> 01:04:26.880
It matters because
Madame Arlena was in the way.

01:04:27.101 --> 01:04:29.641
Messieur Poirot, you have
the French obsession...

01:04:29.642 --> 01:04:32.601
I'm sorry, Belgian obsession,
with crime passionnel.

01:04:32.975 --> 01:04:34.680
But you're barking up the wrong tree.

01:04:35.861 --> 01:04:37.568
You see, I know, I know who did it.

01:04:37.725 --> 01:04:38.440
Oh!

01:04:39.339 --> 01:04:40.355
You do, madame?

01:04:40.425 --> 01:04:42.547
Of course. It was Sir Horace Blatt.

01:04:43.031 --> 01:04:45.809
When I came back here
from my walk at about 11:15...

01:04:45.828 --> 01:04:47.830
I saw him down on the beach.

01:04:47.891 --> 01:04:51.015
He was jumping up and down
and screaming blue murder at Arlena.

01:04:51.723 --> 01:04:53.537
I've never seen a fellow in such a fury.

01:04:54.409 --> 01:04:56.737
Why did not you tell me this before,
madame?

01:04:56.867 --> 01:05:00.199
He is an old chum, isn't he? I didn't
know then you were going to start

01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.551
hurling accusations at me and Kenneth.

01:05:03.106 --> 01:05:06.522
But he is the chap you want. Why
don't you run along and question him?

01:05:07.019 --> 01:05:07.585
Yes.

01:05:07.874 --> 01:05:09.421
I already have done, madame.

01:05:09.903 --> 01:05:12.245
And he is exonerated by his crew.

01:05:12.962 --> 01:05:15.702
All the same,
his story does confirm yours.

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.717
Without knowing it, you have
corroborated your own alibi.

01:05:18.718 --> 01:05:20.190
Bravo, madame.

01:05:22.603 --> 01:05:25.123
I'm sorry, Kenneth.
I nearly put you in it.

01:05:25.678 --> 01:05:27.191
I was only trying to help.

01:05:27.311 --> 01:05:28.373
I know.

01:05:29.658 --> 01:05:30.674
I forgive you.

01:05:35.239 --> 01:05:37.462
I don't want
to hear any more, Patrick.

01:05:37.501 --> 01:05:40.209
If you hadn't been poodlefaking
with that awful woman...

01:05:40.452 --> 01:05:42.826
you wouldn't have been there
in the first place.

01:05:42.913 --> 01:05:44.152
Oh, madame.

01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:48.998
May I have a quick word with you?
About how you spent this morning.

01:05:50.602 --> 01:05:52.886
Why me?
I've got nothing to do with all this.

01:05:53.586 --> 01:05:56.976
You had no reason to love
Arlena Marshall, madame.

01:05:57.497 --> 01:05:58.704
Perhaps not.

01:05:59.713 --> 01:06:01.517
But I was with Linda all morning.

01:06:01.697 --> 01:06:03.173
I went to her room early
to ask her

01:06:03.233 --> 01:06:06.357
to come to Gull Cove to do
some sketching, she wasn't there.

01:06:06.482 --> 01:06:09.690
I mean, she came along a few moments
later. She'd been swimming.

01:06:09.936 --> 01:06:13.194
And then we set off
and we were there all morning.

01:06:13.399 --> 01:06:15.942
If you don't believe me, ask Linda.
She'll tell you...

01:06:15.943 --> 01:06:17.322
Calmez vous, madame.

01:06:18.104 --> 01:06:19.204
Mr Poirot, I'm alright now

01:06:19.253 --> 01:06:23.263
I want you to think about this
very, very carefully.

01:06:23.923 --> 01:06:27.423
At what time precisely did you
leave the cove this morning?

01:06:28.019 --> 01:06:31.114
I was there until 12 o'clock
and I went off for my tennis game.

01:06:31.188 --> 01:06:34.187
- You had a watch?
- No. No, I didn't.

01:06:34.258 --> 01:06:36.422
Then how did you know it was
precisely 12 o'clock?

01:06:37.146 --> 01:06:42.065
Because, well, when I climbed to the top
of the cliff and was waving to Linda...

01:06:42.086 --> 01:06:44.578
who'd gone for a swim,
that awful gun went off.

01:06:44.613 --> 01:06:47.162
The one they fire at noon every day.

01:06:48.832 --> 01:06:50.603
What did you do then, madame?

01:06:51.189 --> 01:06:53.164
Well, I was late, you
see, for my tennis

01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:54.810
which was fixed for 12:30...

01:06:54.838 --> 01:06:57.296
so I simply tore back to the hotel
as fast as I could

01:06:57.672 --> 01:06:59.400
and changed into my tennis things.

01:06:59.542 --> 01:07:01.562
And I went to the court
where I met the others.

01:07:02.015 --> 01:07:04.692
Mr Marshall, Mrs Castle
and Mr Gardener.

01:07:05.407 --> 01:07:07.074
I played with Mr Gardener.

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:08.953
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Not at all, my dear.

01:07:09.171 --> 01:07:11.795
I was sketching at Gull Cove.
Lost track of the time.

01:07:11.819 --> 01:07:15.041
Don't worry. It's only a matter of
four minutes exactly.

01:07:15.352 --> 01:07:17.059
I'm afraid you have to play with me.

01:07:17.303 --> 01:07:18.413
We'd barely started

01:07:18.414 --> 01:07:21.622
when the news about Arlena came.

01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:24.119
Of course,
it's a dreadful thing, Mr Poirot...

01:07:24.136 --> 01:07:26.179
but I can't pretend that I'm not...

01:07:26.637 --> 01:07:28.481
A little relieved.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:30.721
Well, I can understand that.

01:07:31.459 --> 01:07:34.203
Is there anything else you want to ask?

01:07:35.514 --> 01:07:36.887
Not for the time being.

01:07:43.805 --> 01:07:44.929
Come in.

01:07:47.638 --> 01:07:49.595
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:07:51.307 --> 01:07:55.347
Excuse me, mademoiselle,
for intruding into your grief.

01:07:55.653 --> 01:07:58.008
Grief? That's a good one.

01:07:58.312 --> 01:08:00.312
Why should I be
sorry for Arlena?

01:08:01.229 --> 01:08:03.019
You hated her so much?

01:08:03.154 --> 01:08:05.524
I'm glad she's dead
if that's what you mean.

01:08:05.862 --> 01:08:08.467
She was horrid to me
and beastly to my daddy.

01:08:11.371 --> 01:08:14.258
Would you mind if I ask you
a few questions about this morning?

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.322
Why should I?

01:08:15.897 --> 01:08:17.783
I was with Christine Redfern.

01:08:18.133 --> 01:08:21.337
She wanted to go to Gull Cove
to draw some stupid cliffs.

01:08:22.162 --> 01:08:23.161
And did she?

01:08:23.443 --> 01:08:26.785
Oh, yes. She sat under her big hat
while I sunbathed.

01:08:27.081 --> 01:08:29.538
She gets all blistered
if she sits out in the sun.

01:08:29.540 --> 01:08:31.206
- Yes.
- It's bad luck really.

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:34.298
Here it is. She gave it to me.

01:08:34.636 --> 01:08:35.839
It's not bad really.

01:08:35.879 --> 01:08:39.654
No, she has talent, that one.
These are undeniably, er...

01:08:41.051 --> 01:08:41.966
cliffs.

01:08:42.647 --> 01:08:43.938
When did she leave you?

01:08:44.118 --> 01:08:46.617
- Five to 12.
- How can you be so sure?

01:08:46.908 --> 01:08:48.435
Because she asked me.

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:51.301
What time is it, dear?

01:08:54.283 --> 01:08:55.283
Five to 12.

01:08:55.835 --> 01:08:59.354
Lord, I must fly!
I'm playing tennis at 12:30.

01:08:59.474 --> 01:09:02.274
She got into a fearful panic
about being late for tennis

01:09:02.372 --> 01:09:04.037
and rushed off back to the hotel.

01:09:04.194 --> 01:09:06.819
- Would you like this?
- Thanks. It's super.

01:09:08.299 --> 01:09:10.118
I'll see you later after my swim.

01:09:10.631 --> 01:09:14.299
I remember I was halfway down the beach
when Christine called after me.

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:15.808
Don't forget your bathing cap!

01:09:15.809 --> 01:09:17.112
I'd forgotten my bathing cap...

01:09:17.113 --> 01:09:20.343
so I had to come back and put it on.
What a bore!

01:09:24.050 --> 01:09:26.555
Did you see anyone else
while you were swimming?

01:09:27.225 --> 01:09:28.734
No, no one.

01:09:29.287 --> 01:09:32.131
Apart that is from Christine
waving from the top of the cliff.

01:09:37.197 --> 01:09:41.752
Look! Why don't you stop asking me all
these silly questions about Christine?

01:09:42.024 --> 01:09:45.147
She couldn't have murdered Arlena.
Neither could I.

01:09:45.437 --> 01:09:48.379
That slimy Rex Brewster's
the one you should be talking to.

01:09:48.495 --> 01:09:52.001
He hated Arlena. He's the one
who really wanted her dead.

01:09:52.475 --> 01:09:55.731
How can you say that?
He admired her so much.

01:09:55.797 --> 01:09:57.182
Don't be daft!

01:09:57.247 --> 01:10:00.781
He'd written this filthy book about her
which she wouldn't allow him to publish.

01:10:01.323 --> 01:10:03.731
Excuse me, mademoiselle,
but how do you know all this?

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:06.806
I heard them having a row about it
on the beach yesterday.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.774
They thought I'd gone away,
but I hadn't.

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:13.730
Maybe he won't be able to publish it
if he's hanged for murder first.

01:10:15.485 --> 01:10:18.421
If I can't see you faces shining
in every knife, fork and spoon...

01:10:18.446 --> 01:10:20.177
I'll have your guts for
garters, understood?

01:10:20.248 --> 01:10:23.956
Madame! Have you any idea
where I can find messieur Brewster?

01:10:23.996 --> 01:10:27.412
Rex? I thought I saw him
go out into the garden.

01:10:27.494 --> 01:10:28.536
Oh, but...

01:10:29.110 --> 01:10:30.495
He's not the one you want.

01:10:30.748 --> 01:10:32.430
You should cherchez la femme.

01:10:33.015 --> 01:10:33.945
Really, madame?

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.043
Absolutely, I have been having
a little think, and I worked it all out.

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.589
If Horace Blatt is in the clear
and Kenneth Marshall is in the clear

01:10:40.591 --> 01:10:42.423
and I'm... I'm in the clear...

01:10:42.572 --> 01:10:46.729
and Patrick Redfern is in the clear and
Myra Gardener because she was with him.

01:10:47.184 --> 01:10:50.195
Then it's all down to
little Miss Cringe, isn't it?

01:10:50.905 --> 01:10:52.030
Miss Cringe?

01:10:52.115 --> 01:10:52.903
Yes.

01:10:53.481 --> 01:10:56.041
The jealous wife,
Christine Redfern.

01:10:56.292 --> 01:10:58.915
Don't believe all that
about her being too weedy.

01:10:58.939 --> 01:11:01.660
Women fight like tigers
when losing their husbands.

01:11:01.713 --> 01:11:04.181
Not that I've had much experience
of that sort of things myself.

01:11:04.223 --> 01:11:08.181
But what is your theory?
I mean, how did Madame Christine do it?

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:11.407
I don't know. Probably battered
Arlena with a bit of driftwood...

01:11:11.463 --> 01:11:15.171
then finished her off with a little
pressure on the... carotid artery?

01:11:15.203 --> 01:11:17.452
The artery there, yes, yes.

01:11:17.644 --> 01:11:20.253
Everyone knows that.
It's in all the crime novels.

01:11:20.295 --> 01:11:24.336
In fact, only the other day a child of
11 did something like that, in Hungary.

01:11:24.586 --> 01:11:28.204
Or was it Crete? I don't know...
Anyway, she used a pair of nutcrackers.

01:11:29.391 --> 01:11:31.428
I know. Perhaps I'd better go
and see if any are missing...

01:11:31.431 --> 01:11:36.158
No Madame, unfortunately, there are
no nutcracker marks on the throat.

01:11:37.523 --> 01:11:40.209
And Madame Christine
could not possibly have done it.

01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:46.604
Her alibi had been confirmed by
Mademoiselle Linda, and vice versa.

01:11:48.077 --> 01:11:49.911
How very irritating!

01:11:50.618 --> 01:11:56.534
"Under the high... lazy...

01:11:57.823 --> 01:12:02.613
noonday Adriatic sun...

01:12:03.028 --> 01:12:07.050
the body lay on its back,
arms outstretched...

01:12:07.550 --> 01:12:13.122
parodying in death a position
she so often occupied in life."

01:12:13.276 --> 01:12:16.057
Oh. That is marvellous, that's...

01:12:18.086 --> 01:12:19.055
Oh.

01:12:19.681 --> 01:12:22.863
So, you've come, messieur Poirot,
to question me about poor Arlena.

01:12:23.308 --> 01:12:26.891
I am shattered.
I am absolutely shattered.

01:12:27.448 --> 01:12:32.097
She was so wonderfully funny,
so very generous...

01:12:32.163 --> 01:12:33.938
Not generous enough
to give you a release

01:12:33.996 --> 01:12:36.061
so that you could publish
that manuscript, eh?

01:12:37.238 --> 01:12:38.286
Who told you that?

01:12:38.308 --> 01:12:40.557
Never mind, but it is the truth,
n'est-ce pas?

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:42.056
You cannot libel the dead.

01:12:42.155 --> 01:12:47.722
Now you are free to publish
your saucy tales and reap the reward.

01:12:48.159 --> 01:12:52.164
Well, I would admit, from that
point of view, I have benefitted.

01:12:52.293 --> 01:12:57.135
Oh, but I assure you, messieur,
that the loss of so radiant a performer

01:12:57.195 --> 01:13:00.476
infinitely exceeds
any possible gain to myself.

01:13:01.426 --> 01:13:03.223
You must believe that.

01:13:03.765 --> 01:13:07.578
The time of death has been narrowed
to between 11:30 and 12:00.

01:13:07.718 --> 01:13:09.381
Where were you at this time?

01:13:12.295 --> 01:13:14.211
I was on a pedalo.

01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:16.187
A pedalo?

01:13:16.782 --> 01:13:18.084
Whereabouts?

01:13:19.625 --> 01:13:22.791
How should I know?
I wasn't carrying a chart at the time.

01:13:23.174 --> 01:13:26.013
Oh, que c'est amusant.
How amusing that is!

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.969
Chart or no chart, it was perfectly
possible for you to have watched

01:13:29.996 --> 01:13:35.201
Sir Horace Blatt's boat leave and then
to have pedaloed into Ladder Bay...

01:13:35.376 --> 01:13:39.209
there to find
the unsuspecting Arlena asleep...

01:13:39.377 --> 01:13:42.178
and then you strangled her.

01:13:42.621 --> 01:13:46.162
Messieur Poirot, are you aware
that it would take nearly two hours

01:13:46.210 --> 01:13:49.257
to paddle around the island
from Ladder Bay to Gull Bay?

01:13:49.325 --> 01:13:50.783
At 12 o'clock precisely...

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:55.018
as that boring old gun went off
I pedalled into Gull Bay.

01:13:55.175 --> 01:13:57.008
Linda was there, swimming.

01:13:57.595 --> 01:14:01.550
In fact I nearly hit her, she was
splashing around like a deaf seal.

01:14:01.999 --> 01:14:04.206
You say that you saw Mlle Linda

01:14:04.247 --> 01:14:06.233
swimming in Gull Bay at 12 o'clock?

01:14:06.848 --> 01:14:09.760
Certainly, I asked her
to help me pedal back...

01:14:09.832 --> 01:14:11.525
but the little charmer refused.

01:14:12.181 --> 01:14:13.531
What do you want?

01:14:17.375 --> 01:14:18.666
What did you say?

01:14:18.792 --> 01:14:22.666
I said, Good god, darling.
Help me pedal this damned thing back.

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:24.041
My legs are killing me.

01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:25.566
Pedal it back yourself.

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:33.710
So you see, darling,
I simply could not have killed Arlena.

01:14:35.977 --> 01:14:38.632
Messieur, if you are so anxious
to find a murderer...

01:14:38.963 --> 01:14:41.238
why don't you find out
who tried to murder me?

01:14:42.857 --> 01:14:44.294
Murder you?

01:14:45.390 --> 01:14:46.672
What do you mean?

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:52.095
Well, after I'd been left by that lazy
little cow Linda to rupture myself...

01:14:52.189 --> 01:14:53.292
I pedalled off.

01:14:53.929 --> 01:14:56.731
About ten minutes later,
a bottle came whizzing over the cliff

01:14:57.074 --> 01:14:59.393
and smacked down in the water
right next to me.

01:14:59.671 --> 01:15:01.727
The damned thing missed my head
by inches.

01:15:02.403 --> 01:15:04.277
I looked up, there's nobody around.

01:15:08.545 --> 01:15:12.591
I must congratulate you on that highly
interesting and imaginative story.

01:15:12.632 --> 01:15:17.400
I refer of course to your visit, your
fictional visit, to Gull Bay at noon.

01:15:18.127 --> 01:15:21.460
What do you mean "fictional"? Linda!

01:15:21.499 --> 01:15:24.182
Mademoiselle Linda denies
having seen anyone there at the time.

01:15:24.480 --> 01:15:25.688
What?

01:15:25.821 --> 01:15:28.084
Oh, that lousy little hoyden!

01:15:28.406 --> 01:15:32.614
I... know she loathes me because I
adored Arlena, but this is ridiculous.

01:15:32.787 --> 01:15:34.351
You just wait till I catch her...

01:15:34.774 --> 01:15:36.190
You! Linda!

01:15:37.492 --> 01:15:40.867
Linda. You... You just wait!
Stay right...

01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.999
Linda! You tell messieur Poirot

01:15:44.462 --> 01:15:47.410
that I was with you this morning
when you were swimming in Gull Cove.

01:15:47.577 --> 01:15:49.431
Why should I? You weren't.

01:15:50.258 --> 01:15:52.287
You lying little brat!

01:15:52.869 --> 01:15:55.698
You just tell him that you saw me
on the pedalo.

01:15:55.771 --> 01:15:59.016
You tell him that you refused to
help me pedal back! You tell him!

01:16:00.205 --> 01:16:02.973
- You tell him!
- Take your hands off my daughter!

01:16:03.038 --> 01:16:05.400
Then you tell her
to tell him the truth!

01:16:06.421 --> 01:16:08.836
Well, Linda, did you see Mr Brewster

01:16:08.876 --> 01:16:10.893
when you were bathing in Gull Cove
this morning?

01:16:15.377 --> 01:16:17.568
Oh, alright then, yes, I did.

01:16:18.442 --> 01:16:20.746
Linda, you mustn't tell lies.

01:16:21.005 --> 01:16:22.790
You can get people into serious trouble.

01:16:22.955 --> 01:16:25.787
Serious trouble? Hell, darling!
You can get them hanged!

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:29.370
That was rather the idea,
was it not, mademoiselle?

01:16:30.739 --> 01:16:31.921
I'm sorry.

01:16:37.469 --> 01:16:39.742
Kindly accept my apologies, messieur.

01:16:40.273 --> 01:16:42.841
Incidentally, I accept your alibi.

01:16:44.297 --> 01:16:46.236
That's real white of you, Mr P!

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:58.736
No, messieur Poirot,
I am not as lucky as my dear wife.

01:16:58.774 --> 01:17:01.456
I have absolutely no alibi.

01:17:02.319 --> 01:17:05.694
I was sitting over there
on a stone bench reading my book

01:17:05.742 --> 01:17:10.182
and between the hours of
11:00 and 12:15 I didn't move.

01:17:10.363 --> 01:17:12.362
Now, I'm well aware, messieur Poirot...

01:17:12.387 --> 01:17:15.428
that in your world,
when a murder takes place

01:17:15.453 --> 01:17:19.158
everyone automatically
comes up with a watertight alibi.

01:17:19.840 --> 01:17:26.268
However, I belong to that great world
of millions of innocent men and women

01:17:26.331 --> 01:17:29.616
who, curiously enough,
don't have the foresight

01:17:29.648 --> 01:17:31.898
to provide themselves with an alibi

01:17:32.157 --> 01:17:35.876
when a murder is taking place
of which they know absolutely nothing.

01:17:36.659 --> 01:17:38.912
Consequently, as I...

01:17:39.583 --> 01:17:41.767
was guilelessly reading my book...

01:17:41.798 --> 01:17:46.841
there was no gardener to come trotting
by respectfully touching his forelock

01:17:46.876 --> 01:17:50.674
and registering the time
on his grandfather's turnip watch.

01:17:50.739 --> 01:17:52.219
In short, messieur Poirot...

01:17:52.774 --> 01:17:55.070
I don't have the
ghost of an alibi.

01:17:55.357 --> 01:17:59.650
Of course, I could have scampered over
the top of that peak...

01:18:00.039 --> 01:18:02.132
like a mountain goat, and...

01:18:02.521 --> 01:18:06.464
swarmed down the famous steps
we've all heard about...

01:18:06.937 --> 01:18:08.562
and then crept up on Arlena

01:18:08.617 --> 01:18:12.271
and strangled her
with these powerful hands of mine.

01:18:12.817 --> 01:18:15.836
But, unfortunately for you,
I did no such thing.

01:18:15.878 --> 01:18:19.752
You see, I have a big fat motive
but no alibi.

01:18:24.326 --> 01:18:25.578
Next question?

01:18:26.323 --> 01:18:28.489
Next question is what did you do

01:18:28.528 --> 01:18:32.278
when you had finished
being unobserved in the garden?

01:18:33.282 --> 01:18:37.833
I went up to my room, again unobserved,
to change for tennis.

01:18:38.101 --> 01:18:41.961
I was rather thirsty and so I rang
the bell. Naturally, no one answered.

01:18:42.037 --> 01:18:44.870
Where the goddamn staff
had disappeared to was a mystery...

01:18:44.910 --> 01:18:47.408
and worthy even of your talents,
messieur Poirot.

01:18:48.771 --> 01:18:51.304
I turned on the tap,
but there was no water, not a drop.

01:18:51.568 --> 01:18:55.362
Someone was running a bath
down the hall fit to float Noah's Ark.

01:18:56.543 --> 01:18:58.695
"Damned odd time for a bath,"
I'd have said.

01:18:58.777 --> 01:19:00.834
Anyway, I changed

01:19:00.878 --> 01:19:04.419
and appeared suitably attired
in my Fred Perry outfit

01:19:04.757 --> 01:19:07.975
on the tennis court
at precisely 12:30

01:19:08.592 --> 01:19:10.739
to join Daphne and Marshall.

01:19:11.627 --> 01:19:13.852
Mrs Redfern came a few minutes later.

01:19:15.445 --> 01:19:17.392
And that, messieur Poirot...

01:19:17.986 --> 01:19:20.152
concludes the case for the defence.

01:19:21.598 --> 01:19:25.972
You make pleasantries, messieur,
but no alibi is still...

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:30.096
no alibi.

01:19:41.069 --> 01:19:43.222
If you're looking for that,
I've got it in here.

01:19:44.194 --> 01:19:47.234
I've been using it to
sort everything out for you.

01:19:47.277 --> 01:19:49.639
I was wrong about cherchez la femme.
Orry about that...

01:19:49.735 --> 01:19:52.150
But it's quite obviously
cherchez le fruit.

01:19:52.206 --> 01:19:55.164
Rexy is the only one unaccounted for.
Look, I'll show you.

01:19:55.267 --> 01:19:59.058
At 11:30 Arlena Marshall was left here
alive by Horace Blatt...

01:19:59.097 --> 01:20:03.512
who then sailed on down here. At the
same time, Myra and Patrick were here...

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:06.071
Linda and Christine were here,
Kenneth was here

01:20:06.439 --> 01:20:08.058
and I was in my staff meeting.

01:20:08.127 --> 01:20:12.000
So it has just got to be
our genial columnist.

01:20:12.213 --> 01:20:13.997
And, what's more, I know how he did it.

01:20:14.416 --> 01:20:15.746
Oh, you do, madame?

01:20:15.775 --> 01:20:19.633
Absolutely! Recently I was reading a
magazine story about a woman in Malaya

01:20:19.687 --> 01:20:24.020
who was drowned by a huge moray eel
which darted out of a hole...

01:20:24.207 --> 01:20:28.622
dragged her to the floor of the ocean,
its teeth buried in her throat.

01:20:28.647 --> 01:20:30.777
Now that's what gave me
the clue I needed.

01:20:30.814 --> 01:20:35.522
Rex... Rex Brewster could've been
lurking in the water off Ladder Bay...

01:20:35.562 --> 01:20:38.936
and when Arlena appeared on her pedalo,
he could have leapt up...

01:20:39.257 --> 01:20:40.715
pulled her off it...

01:20:40.959 --> 01:20:45.733
Very interesting, madame. The only snag
is that Madame Marshall was not drowned.

01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:49.097
Far less was she gnawed to death...

01:20:49.703 --> 01:20:52.859
And perhaps even more damaging
to your theory is the fact

01:20:53.137 --> 01:20:57.469
that it has been established that
messieur Brewster was here in Gull Cove

01:20:57.501 --> 01:21:00.188
with Mademoiselle Linda at 12 o'clock.

01:21:00.337 --> 01:21:03.646
He could not possible have pedalled
all the way from Gull Cove

01:21:03.775 --> 01:21:06.572
to Ladder Bay in half an hour.

01:21:07.493 --> 01:21:09.367
That's very inconvenient of him.

01:21:10.271 --> 01:21:12.687
I mean, if he didn't do it, who did?

01:21:12.744 --> 01:21:15.938
I just don't see who could have.
Everyone has an alibi.

01:21:15.988 --> 01:21:17.585
Oh, no, they do not, madame.

01:21:17.707 --> 01:21:21.144
Messieur Gardener does not have an
alibi, seems rather proud of the fact.

01:21:21.413 --> 01:21:24.383
Oh, but he does, dear, most definitely.

01:21:25.382 --> 01:21:26.971
What are you telling me, madame?

01:21:27.027 --> 01:21:29.378
At half past 11
I was having my staff meeting...

01:21:29.849 --> 01:21:33.624
giving the hired help
a pleasing stream of the old rancid...

01:21:34.188 --> 01:21:36.271
and in particular
pointing out to Andreas

01:21:36.303 --> 01:21:39.806
that there was absolutely no point
in making your curry de poulet vindaloo

01:21:39.826 --> 01:21:42.967
so hot that it raised welts
on the surface of your tongue...

01:21:43.206 --> 01:21:46.940
when I looked out of the window
and there was Odell reading a book.

01:21:47.614 --> 01:21:51.446
He stayed there throughout
the entire meeting. I'm positive of it.

01:21:52.033 --> 01:21:54.449
What's the matter?
Have I said something?

01:21:54.482 --> 01:21:56.127
You've said a great deal, madame.

01:21:58.092 --> 01:22:00.606
Oh, I... I see what you mean.

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:03.838
You... You mean nobody did it.

01:22:05.465 --> 01:22:09.089
And yet we still have a body, madame.

01:23:59.639 --> 01:24:04.679
- Ah, Rigoletto
- Correct. Ah, Verdi. Quelle élégance!

01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:08.335
It's funny to think, if Giuseppe Verdi
had been an Englishman...

01:24:08.847 --> 01:24:11.933
his name would have been Joe Green.

01:24:12.494 --> 01:24:14.487
Yes, I suppose it would, yes.

01:24:15.508 --> 01:24:16.971
It used to make the boys laugh

01:24:17.003 --> 01:24:19.934
when I was trying to din some Latin
into them when I was a teacher.

01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:22.209
Little boys laugh easily
if it keeps them away...

01:24:22.235 --> 01:24:24.398
even for a moment,
from their study of Latin.

01:24:28.189 --> 01:24:32.772
Messieurs-Dames, please forgive me
for interrupting the cocktail hour...

01:24:32.965 --> 01:24:36.298
but there are two questions
which I must put to you.

01:24:36.510 --> 01:24:37.557
First of all...

01:24:38.213 --> 01:24:41.321
did anybody here throw a bottle
into the sea this morning?

01:24:43.865 --> 01:24:44.925
No?

01:24:45.052 --> 01:24:49.265
Secondly, did any of you take a bath
at 12:15 today?

01:24:49.313 --> 01:24:51.653
An odd time for ablutions.

01:24:53.758 --> 01:24:55.345
How remarkable!

01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:59.093
A bath which nobody admits having taken

01:24:59.211 --> 01:25:01.960
and a bottle which flies by itself.

01:25:04.287 --> 01:25:06.240
Joe Green...

01:25:06.266 --> 01:25:08.723
It's rather more amusing
than at first I thought.

01:26:45.304 --> 01:26:47.720
- Morning, Sir Horace!
- Hello, enjoy your swim?

01:26:47.768 --> 01:26:51.683
Yes. Sorry I'm puffed, the water was
freezing and I'm running to get warm.

01:26:52.275 --> 01:26:55.123
Crying his eyes out?
Tell him to pull himself together.

01:26:55.148 --> 01:26:56.684
Hello, Daph!

01:26:57.324 --> 01:27:00.681
That reminds me of a lady policeman.
She's all out of breath.

01:27:00.906 --> 01:27:03.614
She's telling her friends
how she caught a burglar.

01:27:04.115 --> 01:27:08.155
"I chased him past the grocer's,
and the butcher's, and the baker's."

01:27:08.282 --> 01:27:11.022
And then she said,
"I finally caught him by the cobbler's"

01:27:13.555 --> 01:27:15.892
Sorry, I don't find that
remotely funny, Sir Horace.

01:27:16.824 --> 01:27:19.179
Oh, I stand corrected, Daph.

01:27:19.538 --> 01:27:21.080
I'll tell you what I don't find funny...

01:27:21.113 --> 01:27:23.307
hanging around
waiting for the great detective!

01:27:23.535 --> 01:27:25.284
Oh, good morning, messieur Poirot!

01:27:25.692 --> 01:27:30.152
Listen here, Poirot. Not only
have you not find Arlena's killer...

01:27:30.202 --> 01:27:33.326
but you haven't found my diamond.
So I'm off of this hole, thank you.

01:27:33.856 --> 01:27:36.787
The Gardeners and the Redferns
want to go, too.

01:27:37.114 --> 01:27:40.088
I can't say I blame them.
The place is like a morgue.

01:27:40.696 --> 01:27:42.196
Oh, I am so sorry.

01:27:42.705 --> 01:27:45.607
Madame, there is nothing like
a good night's rest

01:27:45.649 --> 01:27:47.980
to clear the little grey cells.

01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:51.862
Kindly ask all our friends
to forgather in the lounge

01:27:52.151 --> 01:27:54.168
after they have finished
their petit déjeuner.

01:27:54.607 --> 01:27:58.032
- When all will be revealed,
- What?

01:27:58.255 --> 01:27:59.426
You mean you know?

01:27:59.749 --> 01:28:00.568
Oh, yes.

01:28:01.367 --> 01:28:03.230
Give us a few clues!

01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:07.508
Alright, I wish you to consider
very carefully, a bathing cap, a bath...

01:28:07.572 --> 01:28:12.113
a bottle, a wrist watch, the diamond,
the noonday gun, the breath of the sea

01:28:12.616 --> 01:28:14.094
and the height of the cliff.

01:28:14.762 --> 01:28:17.143
From that you should be able to
solve it yourselves.

01:28:18.360 --> 01:28:20.156
We meet again in one hour.

01:28:20.631 --> 01:28:23.317
Now I am going to
have my œ à la coque.

01:28:26.705 --> 01:28:30.787
There goes the most insufferable man
in the world.

01:28:30.897 --> 01:28:34.480
"Ôuf à la coque." That's about
his mark, it's what he talks mostly.

01:28:56.157 --> 01:28:59.923
Mesdames, mademoiselle, messieurs...

01:29:00.815 --> 01:29:04.564
The reason I asked you to meet me here
this morning... please, messieur...

01:29:05.778 --> 01:29:08.028
is that I, Hercule Poirot...

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:12.489
have discovered the identity of
the murderer of Madame Marshall.

01:29:12.712 --> 01:29:14.760
This need surprise no one.

01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:18.127
Are you all comfortable?

01:29:20.810 --> 01:29:22.542
Even the murderer?

01:29:24.666 --> 01:29:27.694
This has been a most unusual crime...

01:29:28.336 --> 01:29:31.955
in that apparently nobody had
the opportunity of committing it.

01:29:32.478 --> 01:29:36.477
Madame Marshall was killed
between 11:30 and 12 noon yesterday

01:29:36.626 --> 01:29:39.382
and yet every single one of you
had a perfect alibi...

01:29:39.431 --> 01:29:42.629
including you, messieur Gardener,
without knowing it.

01:29:42.989 --> 01:29:45.588
I'm very sorry
if I have disappointed you.

01:29:46.513 --> 01:29:49.116
We had undeniably a body...

01:29:49.311 --> 01:29:51.676
which meant that
somebody was lying.

01:29:52.708 --> 01:29:53.783
Who?

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.723
After exercising
considerable reflection...

01:29:58.403 --> 01:30:01.705
I came to the conclusion
that it was you...

01:30:05.632 --> 01:30:07.299
Madame Redfern.

01:30:09.615 --> 01:30:10.751
Me?

01:30:11.854 --> 01:30:13.895
But I didn't lie to you, I swear it.

01:30:14.146 --> 01:30:15.354
Oh, yes, you did, madame.

01:30:15.676 --> 01:30:18.306
When I asked you at what time
you left Gull Cove yesterday...

01:30:18.332 --> 01:30:20.206
you said it was 12 o'clock.

01:30:20.487 --> 01:30:22.153
You knew this, you said...

01:30:22.187 --> 01:30:25.645
because you heard
that awful gun go off

01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:28.820
when you were standing
on top of the cliffs waving at Linda

01:30:28.846 --> 01:30:30.951
who was swimming in the water below.

01:30:34.227 --> 01:30:37.912
But messieur Brewster was in the bay
at the same time.

01:30:37.983 --> 01:30:40.613
It is very curious
that you did not mention him.

01:30:40.749 --> 01:30:43.748
And it's even more curious
that when I confronted M Brewster

01:30:44.139 --> 01:30:47.528
with the fact that his story about
entering the bay on his pedalo

01:30:47.562 --> 01:30:51.291
at the very moment that the midday gun
went off was denied by Linda

01:30:51.481 --> 01:30:53.866
he lost his temper.
He attacked the poor girl.

01:30:53.973 --> 01:30:58.628
It would've been so much easier to have
called his second witness. You, madame.

01:30:58.654 --> 01:31:01.187
He must have seen you
standing on top of the cliff

01:31:01.768 --> 01:31:04.036
and yet he made no mention of it.
Why not?

01:31:04.201 --> 01:31:05.558
The answer is obvious...

01:31:06.112 --> 01:31:07.511
you were not there.

01:31:10.904 --> 01:31:12.177
But I was there.

01:31:12.668 --> 01:31:14.636
And I did wave and
Linda waved back.

01:31:14.713 --> 01:31:17.632
- Tell him, Linda!
- It's true. She did wave, honestly.

01:31:17.859 --> 01:31:21.833
Yes, she probably waved
but there was no noonday gun, was there?

01:31:22.041 --> 01:31:23.402
I don't remember it. No.

01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.289
No, there was no noonday gun for a
very good reason. It was not 12 o'clock.

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:30.692
But she asked me the time, I looked
at my watch and it was five to 12!

01:31:30.748 --> 01:31:33.109
The watch, now that is very important.

01:31:33.319 --> 01:31:35.803
Let us go back to yesterday morning,
shall we?

01:31:35.861 --> 01:31:38.940
I was having breakfast on the terrace,
an egg...

01:31:39.066 --> 01:31:42.599
and in the course of performing
some act of léger de main for you...

01:31:42.636 --> 01:31:46.496
Mademoiselle, I happened to notice
that you were not wearing a watch.

01:31:46.591 --> 01:31:49.340
Not particularly surprising
as you had been swimming...

01:31:49.395 --> 01:31:53.270
a fact that could be noted by anyone
looking out of a hotel window.

01:31:53.601 --> 01:31:58.125
You, Madame Redfern, actually told me
you went to her room early

01:31:58.255 --> 01:32:02.581
to ask her to come with you
to Gull Cove to do some sketching.

01:32:02.815 --> 01:32:05.368
But that she was not there.

01:32:05.614 --> 01:32:07.304
What a perfect opportunity

01:32:07.357 --> 01:32:11.261
to put Mademoiselle Linda's watch
forward... 20 minutes?

01:32:12.924 --> 01:32:15.186
A few moments later, as you told me...

01:32:15.241 --> 01:32:19.698
Linda appeared in the corridor,
as you knew she would.

01:32:20.161 --> 01:32:22.619
And you invited her to accompany you.

01:32:22.809 --> 01:32:24.912
- Would you like to come?
- Yes, I'd love to.

01:32:24.938 --> 01:32:26.949
Alright, see you
in the hall in ten minutes.

01:32:28.542 --> 01:32:30.084
Hello, Mr Poirot.

01:32:33.216 --> 01:32:37.634
Your plan to make Linda
your false alibi was now in motion.

01:32:38.371 --> 01:32:40.084
This is pure
supposition, Poirot.

01:32:40.545 --> 01:32:41.997
I've never heard such twaddle.

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:45.856
Twaddle or not, it is the only
explanation which fits all the facts.

01:32:46.066 --> 01:32:47.773
Now if you will be a little patient...

01:32:47.799 --> 01:32:52.090
I will explain to you
exactly what happened next at Gull Cove.

01:32:52.265 --> 01:32:56.077
Madame Redfern, unseen by Linda,
consulted her own watch...

01:32:56.111 --> 01:32:58.887
which she was wearing
but kept concealed

01:32:58.916 --> 01:33:02.048
under the sleeve of that
strange voluminous outfit

01:33:02.074 --> 01:33:04.198
she chose to protect her from the sun.

01:33:04.395 --> 01:33:07.543
It is of course 25 to 12.

01:33:07.803 --> 01:33:13.086
She then asked Linda the time,
who naturally said it was five to 12.

01:33:13.505 --> 01:33:18.330
Linda then starts to go down
to the sea. While her back is turned...

01:33:18.361 --> 01:33:21.943
Madame Redfern returns Linda's watch
to the correct time...

01:33:21.973 --> 01:33:27.745
then calls Linda back, telling her
she has forgotten her bathing cap.

01:33:28.027 --> 01:33:32.152
Why should she bother to do that,
you may ask?

01:33:32.370 --> 01:33:34.245
The answer is simple.

01:33:34.378 --> 01:33:38.086
Remember, at 12 o'clock
the noonday gun is due to go off.

01:33:38.352 --> 01:33:42.831
And she can take no chance of
Linda hearing and noting it.

01:33:43.178 --> 01:33:45.843
A girl splashing about in the sea

01:33:45.869 --> 01:33:50.504
and wearing a bathing cap
would hear nothing.

01:33:52.051 --> 01:33:53.842
So let us exactly see what happened

01:33:53.875 --> 01:33:58.099
as Madame Redfern hurried up
from the cove to the top of the cliff.

01:33:58.128 --> 01:34:02.945
It is 11:40. She pauses to wave.

01:34:03.184 --> 01:34:04.990
Linda waves back.

01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:07.341
But there is no Mr Brewster.

01:34:07.388 --> 01:34:09.330
No noonday gun.

01:34:09.711 --> 01:34:12.927
Madame Redfern now turns

01:34:12.953 --> 01:34:16.869
and runs across the path which
separates Gull Cove from Ladder Bay.

01:34:16.934 --> 01:34:20.397
That takes her six or seven minutes,
no more.

01:34:20.855 --> 01:34:23.645
She arrives at Ladder Bay
at about a quarter to 12

01:34:23.671 --> 01:34:26.071
and sees Madame Arlena
sitting impatiently...

01:34:26.097 --> 01:34:28.475
awaiting the arrival
of Patrick Redfern...

01:34:28.501 --> 01:34:31.129
with whom, I am convinced,
she had a rendezvous.

01:34:32.937 --> 01:34:34.770
Oh, Christ!

01:34:34.803 --> 01:34:38.552
Suddenly, to her great chagrin
she sees you, madame...

01:34:38.578 --> 01:34:40.986
about to come down the ladder

01:34:41.012 --> 01:34:44.046
But I couldn't have!
I suffer from vertigo.

01:34:44.107 --> 01:34:45.232
You know that.

01:34:45.311 --> 01:34:49.022
I only know that because you took
good care to stage an incident

01:34:49.103 --> 01:34:51.351
showing me that you suffer from vertigo.

01:34:51.666 --> 01:34:54.374
The day before yesterday,
on the terrace.

01:34:55.730 --> 01:34:58.563
As we were having a stroll
and I was drawing your attention

01:34:58.596 --> 01:35:02.337
to the sunbathing figures on the beach
below us, you suddenly fell against me

01:35:02.363 --> 01:35:05.529
and stepped back,
saying you suffered from vertigo.

01:35:06.001 --> 01:35:08.709
But she does have it, Poirot.
She's always had it.

01:35:08.823 --> 01:35:10.345
That is not the case, messieur.

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:12.163
Your wife only pretended to have it

01:35:12.189 --> 01:35:15.286
in order to prove that she
could not have climbed down the ladder.

01:35:16.570 --> 01:35:18.844
But, yesterday afternoon...

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:22.326
I myself stood on the cliff
overlooking Gull Cove

01:35:22.469 --> 01:35:26.181
and I discovered something
rather interesting.

01:35:26.814 --> 01:35:32.510
In order to have seen Linda
in the water below and to wave to her...

01:35:32.636 --> 01:35:36.697
you would have had to stand
right on the very edge.

01:35:37.329 --> 01:35:40.021
Although I do not suffer from vertigo...

01:35:40.047 --> 01:35:41.693
I myself...

01:35:42.309 --> 01:35:44.112
was quite dizzy.

01:35:46.053 --> 01:35:50.511
For you, madame, had you suffered from
vertigo, it would have been impossible.

01:35:52.998 --> 01:35:56.479
Let us now resume the story from the
point at which you descended the ladder.

01:35:56.677 --> 01:35:59.655
Madame Arlena decided to avoid
a confrontation

01:35:59.755 --> 01:36:01.420
and was about to leave the beach

01:36:01.545 --> 01:36:05.407
when she noticed a small grotto
at the base of a cliff.

01:36:06.083 --> 01:36:09.317
You may well ask
how I knew she had been in there.

01:36:09.526 --> 01:36:13.953
Yesterday afternoon, not only
did I discover the false diamond

01:36:13.987 --> 01:36:16.115
that Horace Blatt had returned to her...

01:36:16.146 --> 01:36:19.270
but my excellent wine taster's nose

01:36:19.302 --> 01:36:22.648
had detected, not as you put it,
Madame Castle, a pong...

01:36:22.834 --> 01:36:26.480
but Souffle de Mer,
"the breath of the sea"...

01:36:26.703 --> 01:36:32.116
which, as you know, messieur Marshall,
was her favourite perfume.

01:36:33.656 --> 01:36:35.687
But I am digressing.

01:36:36.271 --> 01:36:40.145
You ran down on to the beach,
but Madame Arlena had disappeared.

01:36:40.584 --> 01:36:41.910
Arlena!

01:36:43.164 --> 01:36:44.775
Where are you?

01:36:46.190 --> 01:36:47.879
I know you're here.

01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.837
I want to talk to you!

01:36:51.903 --> 01:36:53.236
Be with you in a minute.

01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:56.699
Well, what is it?

01:37:09.057 --> 01:37:11.795
Look here, Poirot.
Haven't we heard enough of this blarney?

01:37:11.864 --> 01:37:15.057
Arlena was not murdered with a blunt
instrument, she was strangled.

01:37:15.473 --> 01:37:18.265
And if you would care to bend
those beady Belgian eyes of yours

01:37:18.291 --> 01:37:23.065
on Christine's hands, you'll see they
are too small to have strangled anyone.

01:37:23.247 --> 01:37:27.849
Yes, I quite agree. In fact that was
a major stumbling block to my theory.

01:37:27.997 --> 01:37:31.330
Redfern's right,
this knocks your theory out of court.

01:37:31.808 --> 01:37:34.275
Odell, please, you
weren't even there...

01:37:34.486 --> 01:37:35.743
and I was.

01:37:35.786 --> 01:37:38.528
Remember,
I saw her lying there strangled.

01:37:38.891 --> 01:37:40.487
Christine couldn't have done it.

01:37:40.523 --> 01:37:43.906
I am absolutely of your opinion, madame.
In fact, she did not do it.

01:37:44.066 --> 01:37:46.162
The murder was committed by...

01:37:46.759 --> 01:37:49.426
her husband, Patrick Redfern.

01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:54.391
Now you really are
talking out of the top of your hat!

01:37:54.787 --> 01:37:59.033
Oh, for God's sakes. Patrick couldn't
have done it, any more than his wife.

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:03.289
Don't forget I was with him
the whole time between 11:30 and 12:00

01:38:03.315 --> 01:38:06.106
when we came into the bay
and saw her lying there.

01:38:06.145 --> 01:38:08.650
That is the whole point, madame.

01:38:09.213 --> 01:38:13.037
One moderately well-made young woman
is very much like another.

01:38:13.085 --> 01:38:15.675
Two brown arms, two brown legs

01:38:15.779 --> 01:38:18.610
and a little piece of bathing suit
in between.

01:38:18.978 --> 01:38:23.143
What exactly did you see from your
place in the boat, Madame Gardener?

01:38:23.554 --> 01:38:25.937
The ardent young lover, M Redfern...

01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:29.340
bending over the body
with suntanned limbs

01:38:29.366 --> 01:38:32.205
wearing Arlena's white
bathing costume...

01:38:32.494 --> 01:38:35.514
and a red Chinese hat.

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:38.922
As I pointed out
a couple of days ago...

01:38:38.965 --> 01:38:41.799
all bodies lying on the beach
are alike.

01:38:41.902 --> 01:38:43.901
"They are not men and women," I said.

01:38:43.927 --> 01:38:46.550
"There is nothing personal about them,"
I said.

01:38:46.576 --> 01:38:51.309
"They are like rows of butcher's meat
grilling in the sun," I said.

01:38:51.694 --> 01:38:55.531
No wonder you were fooled
into imagining that you had seen

01:38:55.605 --> 01:38:57.522
the corpse of Madame Marshall...

01:38:57.564 --> 01:38:59.729
when what you had actually seen

01:38:59.801 --> 01:39:03.391
was the live body of
Madame Christine Redfern.

01:39:04.207 --> 01:39:07.081
That is why the murderer
had to conceal the face...

01:39:07.124 --> 01:39:11.040
because it was not the murder victim
lying there, but somebody else.

01:39:11.089 --> 01:39:13.861
And who else would help
messieur Redfern..

01:39:13.916 --> 01:39:16.055
But his own wife?

01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:20.752
And now the performance
for the benefit of the witness is over.

01:39:21.044 --> 01:39:25.053
Madame Gardener departs
from the bay by boat to fetch help.

01:39:25.417 --> 01:39:28.874
And what do you think happened,
Madame Gardener...

01:39:29.117 --> 01:39:33.186
as soon as you had disappeared?

01:39:36.048 --> 01:39:38.603
Why, the corpse leaps to her feet

01:39:38.750 --> 01:39:42.916
and runs into the grotto to repace
Madame Arlena's bathing costume...

01:39:42.995 --> 01:39:45.661
which she had stripped off
the unconscious woman

01:39:46.086 --> 01:39:48.732
and worn to play her part as a corpse.

01:39:49.033 --> 01:39:52.831
I've got a point, Poirot,
which will scupper all your whole case.

01:39:53.423 --> 01:39:58.145
Christine is as pale as
pasteurised milk. Now the question is...

01:39:58.189 --> 01:40:02.267
how could I have possibly mistaken
her arms and legs for Arlena's?

01:40:02.532 --> 01:40:04.506
This covers nothing at all, madame.

01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:07.028
In answer to your question,
I would ask you to consider

01:40:07.054 --> 01:40:11.563
the bizarre nature
of Madame Redfern's beach apparel.

01:40:12.452 --> 01:40:15.324
When I saw Madame Redfern
in the lobby yesterday morning...

01:40:15.350 --> 01:40:18.150
she was wearing
a totally exaggerated garment

01:40:18.291 --> 01:40:21.537
which completely covered her
from wrist to neck.

01:40:22.148 --> 01:40:25.961
No mere fear of the sun could have
occasioned such a choice of dress.

01:40:26.256 --> 01:40:29.934
She had to wear such an all-concealing
outfit because underneath...

01:40:30.313 --> 01:40:32.455
she was brown as a nut

01:40:32.883 --> 01:40:36.841
In the grotto, after having
climbed into the unconscious

01:40:36.877 --> 01:40:38.862
Madame Arlena's swimming costume...

01:40:39.117 --> 01:40:42.766
all she had to do was
to stain her hands and neck...

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:45.864
something she could not have done
earlier. Why?

01:40:45.913 --> 01:40:48.416
Because Linda would have noticed.

01:40:49.082 --> 01:40:51.764
She puts on the earrings

01:40:52.732 --> 01:40:54.857
and then she runs
out of the grotto

01:40:55.318 --> 01:41:01.013
and onto the beach,
settles herself on Arlena's towel

01:41:01.295 --> 01:41:05.650
and puts her great big Chinese hat
over her face

01:41:06.011 --> 01:41:09.427
and lies still to await the arrival of
her husband and yourself.

01:41:10.184 --> 01:41:11.081
Dead...

01:41:11.784 --> 01:41:13.667
on cue, as it were.

01:41:15.236 --> 01:41:19.776
And this, I must admit,
he stage-managed superbly...

01:41:19.832 --> 01:41:21.706
timing his appearance at Ladder Bay

01:41:21.738 --> 01:41:26.520
exactly to coincide
with the sound of the noonday gun.

01:41:32.866 --> 01:41:34.448
The rest was easy.

01:41:34.677 --> 01:41:37.439
She now changed back
into her original costume.

01:41:38.056 --> 01:41:40.117
It was about five past 12.

01:41:40.415 --> 01:41:45.165
Madame Redfern bids her husband a
hurried farewell. The clock is ticking.

01:41:45.446 --> 01:41:48.351
She runs back across the island
to rejoin the path

01:41:48.451 --> 01:41:50.796
leading from Gull Bay to the hotel.

01:41:50.958 --> 01:41:53.755
She has one more task to perform.

01:41:53.836 --> 01:41:57.837
She must get rid of the
incriminating bottle of suntan stain.

01:41:57.911 --> 01:42:01.107
The bottle that
no one would admit throwing.

01:42:01.314 --> 01:42:04.362
So she hurls it over the cliff.

01:42:05.036 --> 01:42:09.835
But has the bad luck to have the event
witnessed by messieur Brewster...

01:42:09.861 --> 01:42:11.885
whom it almost hit.

01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:15.452
She reaches the hotel,
arriving there about 12:15.

01:42:15.631 --> 01:42:17.714
I myself timed the journey.

01:42:17.802 --> 01:42:22.844
But then I was not running like
a young gazelle, for obvious reasons.

01:42:23.590 --> 01:42:27.433
Madame Redfern now takes the bath,
heard by messieur Gardner...

01:42:27.494 --> 01:42:33.076
the bath no one would admit to taking,
in order to wash off the suntan.

01:42:33.609 --> 01:42:37.220
She changes into tennis clothes
and appears on the court

01:42:37.289 --> 01:42:40.621
a few minutes late it is true,
but unruffled and smiling...

01:42:40.647 --> 01:42:42.229
a picture of innocence.

01:42:46.321 --> 01:42:48.427
Yes, messieur and Madame Redfern...

01:42:48.498 --> 01:42:53.095
I blame myself for not having seen
through your little charades earlier.

01:42:53.153 --> 01:42:56.919
But then, unfortunately,
not even Hercule Poirot is perfect.

01:42:57.624 --> 01:42:59.207
From the moment you arrived...

01:42:59.242 --> 01:43:02.999
you started playing out a series
of carefully rehearsed scenes...

01:43:03.165 --> 01:43:06.372
in such a manner
that all might hear or see.

01:43:06.656 --> 01:43:09.404
Together, there were
scenes of hysterical jealousy

01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:11.546
played close to open windows.

01:43:11.640 --> 01:43:13.321
You don't want to talk!

01:43:13.447 --> 01:43:16.588
Look here! Can't I even speak
to a pretty woman without you

01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:18.523
jumping to the
conclusion that I'm...

01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:20.402
having an affair with her?

01:43:20.455 --> 01:43:21.744
But you are, aren't you?

01:43:21.793 --> 01:43:24.543
A part, you, madame,
took every opportunity

01:43:24.641 --> 01:43:25.722
to give the impression

01:43:25.785 --> 01:43:29.096
that you are a physically frail woman
who's no good at sports

01:43:29.135 --> 01:43:31.797
and who had to hide her skin away
from the sun

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:35.324
because it blistered
and made her look like, what was it?

01:43:35.357 --> 01:43:37.460
An Italian ice cream?

01:43:37.950 --> 01:43:43.777
And who was altogether to be pitied as
a poor little helpless abandoned wife.

01:43:44.101 --> 01:43:45.517
Whilst you, messieur...

01:43:45.543 --> 01:43:49.215
took elaborately indiscreet pains
to advertise your romance...

01:43:49.296 --> 01:43:54.406
instead of trying to conceal it
as any prudent lover would.

01:43:55.350 --> 01:43:59.182
I think you will all agree
that it was a most audacious plan...

01:43:59.503 --> 01:44:01.321
brilliantly executed.

01:44:01.347 --> 01:44:03.097
Oh, yes, brilliantly.

01:44:03.444 --> 01:44:07.347
But the one thing you have failed to
supply, messieur Poirot, is motive.

01:44:08.329 --> 01:44:10.679
Why on earth should I kill Arlena?

01:44:11.624 --> 01:44:13.412
I absolutely adored her.

01:44:15.556 --> 01:44:17.499
Adultery may be reprehensible...

01:44:17.922 --> 01:44:19.649
but it certainly
is not criminal.

01:44:21.609 --> 01:44:25.117
No, messieur, you did not adore her,
you adored her money.

01:44:25.408 --> 01:44:30.580
And, more especially, the magnificent
diamond offered her by Sir Horace Blatt.

01:44:31.908 --> 01:44:36.426
Those who teach Latin to small boys
are not exactly overpaid.

01:44:37.331 --> 01:44:40.508
You're not at all the romantic figure
you like to present.

01:44:40.534 --> 01:44:44.617
You are a hardened adventurer
and a vicious swindler...

01:44:45.049 --> 01:44:47.845
who had absolutely no moral compunction

01:44:47.871 --> 01:44:51.349
in borrowing the diamond
from Madame Arlena

01:44:51.683 --> 01:44:52.756
and of

01:44:53.316 --> 01:44:55.999
substituting a paste copy.

01:44:56.664 --> 01:44:59.451
Oh, pray, do continue, messieur Poirot.

01:45:00.066 --> 01:45:03.953
Oh, yes, messieur, politeness
is very much part of the act.

01:45:04.495 --> 01:45:07.287
You knew that
your deception would be discovered.

01:45:07.471 --> 01:45:08.847
Too bloody right.

01:45:08.989 --> 01:45:12.938
And you had to eliminate the
only witness capable of exposing you.

01:45:12.964 --> 01:45:14.975
And what better opportunity
than on holiday...

01:45:15.978 --> 01:45:17.821
in a small exclusive island...

01:45:18.123 --> 01:45:21.563
where you could plan
and execute her murder?

01:45:23.371 --> 01:45:26.371
Picture to yourself the scene,
mes amis.

01:45:26.598 --> 01:45:28.337
The half-lit grotto.

01:45:28.363 --> 01:45:31.593
Madame Arlena
slowly returning to consciousness

01:45:31.781 --> 01:45:38.204
and the so solicitous messieur Patrick
preparing le moment juste to strike.

01:45:39.570 --> 01:45:41.555
Oh, Patrick.

01:45:43.135 --> 01:45:45.801
Suddenly, his hands
are around her throat.

01:45:46.076 --> 01:45:48.075
She struggles...

01:45:48.101 --> 01:45:52.017
and it is the end of poor, foolish...

01:45:52.117 --> 01:45:57.700
beautiful, gullible Arlena Marshall.

01:46:02.888 --> 01:46:07.490
And that, mesdames,
mademoiselle, messieurs

01:46:07.639 --> 01:46:10.551
is the story of the murder of
Arlena Marshall.

01:46:11.345 --> 01:46:13.781
The only thing they had not foreseen

01:46:13.852 --> 01:46:18.547
was the presence on this island
of Hercule Poirot.

01:46:24.611 --> 01:46:26.944
The well-known romancer
and teller of tales.

01:46:26.970 --> 01:46:32.552
Excellent plot line. Imaginatively
conceived. Good, clear narrative style.

01:46:32.913 --> 01:46:34.995
I'll give you nine out of ten, Poirot.

01:46:35.114 --> 01:46:40.164
I'm deducting one mark
for total absence of proof.

01:46:42.398 --> 01:46:43.814
Is that true?

01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:47.969
We've sat here and listened to all that
and you can't prove a word of it?

01:46:50.365 --> 01:46:53.799
Unfortunately, messieur Redfern
is absolutely right.

01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:56.404
I haven't a shred of evidence.

01:46:56.481 --> 01:46:59.466
Although that is
unquestionably what happened.

01:46:59.571 --> 01:47:01.404
I don't think we need to sit here

01:47:01.509 --> 01:47:05.030
and be insulted by
this fanciful little mountebank.

01:47:05.740 --> 01:47:08.238
Come along, darling.
Shall we go and pack?

01:47:10.911 --> 01:47:13.358
Just give us five minutes, Mr Poirot...

01:47:13.384 --> 01:47:15.825
and I'm sure we'll be able to work out
how you did it.

01:47:22.568 --> 01:47:25.964
After all, where were you
at the time of the murder?

01:47:31.999 --> 01:47:35.757
You've let that pair get off scot-free
and I haven't even got my diamond back!

01:47:36.545 --> 01:47:38.503
You've made a right cock-up, Poirot.

01:48:31.693 --> 01:48:34.298
Oh, how very kind of you to see us off!

01:48:34.632 --> 01:48:37.225
Well, goodbye, my dear friends.

01:48:37.966 --> 01:48:40.667
I don't think there'll be any necessity
to leave a forwarding address.

01:48:40.693 --> 01:48:42.876
Just a moment, Mr Redfern.

01:48:43.496 --> 01:48:45.326
Haven't you forgotten something?

01:48:45.679 --> 01:48:48.675
Why pay, Patrick?
They've done nothing but insult us.

01:48:49.257 --> 01:48:51.001
Oh, we must pay it, darling.

01:48:51.245 --> 01:48:55.224
After all, we wouldn't want anybody to
think we were cheats now, would we?

01:48:57.290 --> 01:48:59.431
- I know you'll take a cheque.
- Certainly.

01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:05.924
Of course, I also know that you're
thinking the cheque may well bounce...

01:49:06.821 --> 01:49:11.394
but I'm afraid
that's as good as it gets.

01:49:14.371 --> 01:49:19.787
Here you are, dear. I've put
a little extra on for the inconvenience.

01:49:20.256 --> 01:49:21.790
Thank you so much.

01:49:24.210 --> 01:49:26.443
Would you mind me saying something,
Miss Castle?

01:49:26.879 --> 01:49:30.056
Your ensemble does
absolutely nothing for you.

01:49:30.739 --> 01:49:31.968
Goodbye.

01:49:33.264 --> 01:49:35.668
Un instant, s'il vous plaît,
messieur Ruber.

01:49:37.228 --> 01:49:39.648
- Messieur Felix Ruber?
- Who did you say?

01:49:39.788 --> 01:49:42.653
- Ruber?
- Who the hell is Ruber?

01:49:42.915 --> 01:49:46.189
Felix Ruber is the widower of
Alice Ruber...

01:49:46.255 --> 01:49:49.588
whose strangled body had been
discovered on the Yorkshire moors

01:49:49.614 --> 01:49:50.613
some months ago.

01:49:50.682 --> 01:49:55.883
I was called in by the Trojan Insurance
Company to examine the police report.

01:49:56.195 --> 01:49:58.611
In the event of Mrs Ruber's death...

01:49:58.729 --> 01:50:01.807
her husband was a beneficiary of
a large sum of money.

01:50:02.098 --> 01:50:06.217
The police were satisfied that it was
the work of a madman or a tramp

01:50:06.393 --> 01:50:09.331
and so was I,
since the only possible suspect...

01:50:09.358 --> 01:50:12.274
the husband, had a cast-iron alibi...

01:50:12.616 --> 01:50:16.435
which had been established
by a woman-hiker

01:50:16.461 --> 01:50:19.049
who had found the body
earlier in the day.

01:50:19.358 --> 01:50:21.774
But last night I asked myself.

01:50:22.110 --> 01:50:23.651
A strangulation...

01:50:23.677 --> 01:50:27.052
an innocent witness, a change of time.

01:50:27.208 --> 01:50:30.748
Could the similarity in the pattern of
the events here on the island

01:50:30.783 --> 01:50:34.015
and those on the moors
be a mere coincidence?

01:50:34.939 --> 01:50:36.855
No, mes amis, the lonely hiker

01:50:36.905 --> 01:50:39.899
was none other than
Madame Christine Redfern.

01:50:39.976 --> 01:50:42.342
While messieur Ruber was on a train...

01:50:42.368 --> 01:50:47.947
undoubtedly attracting attention to his
presence before potential witnesses.

01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:52.001
The bigamous messieur Ruber
was now free

01:50:52.027 --> 01:50:55.736
to return to his surviving wife,
Madame Redfern.

01:51:00.300 --> 01:51:05.141
You were clever enough to avoid putting
your signature in the hotel register...

01:51:05.167 --> 01:51:08.841
but, you know, the signature on
this cheque is really quite good enough.

01:51:09.855 --> 01:51:14.429
Different names, of course.
Here on the claim form

01:51:14.455 --> 01:51:18.788
for Alice Ruber's insurance policy,
it appears as Felix Ruber...

01:51:18.814 --> 01:51:21.930
and here on the hotel cheque
it appears as Patrick Redfern.

01:51:22.097 --> 01:51:28.322
Different names, but, messieur,
undeniably the same handwriting.

01:51:29.821 --> 01:51:31.811
My God.

01:51:32.498 --> 01:51:35.821
You were wrong to tell me that
little joke about Giuseppe Verdi

01:51:35.847 --> 01:51:38.437
being called Joe Green in English...

01:51:38.616 --> 01:51:42.215
or that you had once you taught Latin
to small boys.

01:51:42.484 --> 01:51:45.109
It was at that moment that I realised

01:51:45.163 --> 01:51:46.593
that in that language

01:51:47.140 --> 01:51:48.459
"Felix Ruber"

01:51:48.917 --> 01:51:50.730
is "Red Fern".

01:51:52.085 --> 01:51:55.793
You see, it is folly
to try and trick Hercule Poirot...

01:51:55.834 --> 01:51:57.791
even in a dead language.

01:51:57.838 --> 01:52:01.782
Do you think anyone's going to believe
the evidence of a couple of signatures?

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:03.857
And your bloody silly word games?

01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:08.477
Messieur, if my modest assumptions
are too fanciful for you...

01:52:08.682 --> 01:52:13.791
then perhaps a photograph
of a hiker and the mourning husband...

01:52:13.826 --> 01:52:17.419
which must have appeared in local papers
and which I of course have sent for...

01:52:17.582 --> 01:52:19.589
will be enough proof to hang you, sir.

01:52:20.041 --> 01:52:23.733
You will be arrested for
the murder of Alice Ruber

01:52:23.963 --> 01:52:25.692
and of Arlena Marshall.

01:52:29.103 --> 01:52:33.435
But before that, there is a small favour
I would like to ask of you.

01:52:38.294 --> 01:52:40.850
Would you smoke the pipe

01:52:40.876 --> 01:52:44.103
which has been conspicuous
by being unlit since you arrived here?

01:52:46.471 --> 01:52:48.470
No?

01:52:52.190 --> 01:52:53.715
Dommage.

01:53:03.493 --> 01:53:04.781
As I thought.

01:53:09.474 --> 01:53:13.556
Sir Horace, please be careful
to whom you give it next time.

01:53:14.982 --> 01:53:17.355
My God, you're a wonder, Poirot.

01:53:19.930 --> 01:53:21.263
Yes?

01:53:23.389 --> 01:53:25.129
Poor messieur Poirot.

01:53:25.282 --> 01:53:27.244
Brave messieur Poirot.

01:53:27.318 --> 01:53:31.740
I've just had a telephone call from His
Majesty and he is very pleased with...

01:53:31.804 --> 01:53:33.519
The King of Tyrania?

01:53:33.681 --> 01:53:37.445
He's very pleased with the matter being
cleared up so quickly and so discreetly.

01:53:37.499 --> 01:53:41.550
He's so pleased that he's awarding you
the Order of St Gudrun the Inquisitive.

01:53:41.741 --> 01:53:44.876
- St Gudrun the Inquisitive?
- First Class.

01:53:46.000 --> 01:53:48.115
How many classes are there?
