00:05.250 --> 00:06.420
MAN: Shadowhunters...

00:06.420 --> 00:08.500
Sister Cleophas,
are you Luke's sister?

00:08.500 --> 00:09.830
I am.

00:09.830 --> 00:11.750
What is that

00:11.750 --> 00:14.500
MAIA: Simon, watch out!

00:14.500 --> 00:16.620
I'm Simon.
Kyle.

00:16.620 --> 00:18.040
Do you know anyone
who needs a place?

00:18.040 --> 00:19.380
SIMON: This place is awesome!

00:19.380 --> 00:21.040
CLARY: Jace...

00:21.040 --> 00:22.420
Why don't you remember
where you've been all night?

00:22.420 --> 00:24.170
I think I'm losing my mind.

00:24.170 --> 00:25.670
What broke you free of my order?

00:25.670 --> 00:27.210
Clary.

00:27.210 --> 00:30.330
I have a rather complicated
problem, and I hear if anyone

00:30.330 --> 00:33.120
can help me... it's you.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.290
I would've sworn I knew
every warlock in this city.

00:37.290 --> 00:39.210
Oh, I'm not
from around here.

00:41.000 --> 00:43.620
And how is it that you
heard about my services?

00:46.120 --> 00:49.040
A friend spoke of you:
the late Ragnor Fell.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.170
I'm no slouch,

00:52.170 --> 00:54.330
but... what I do need

00:54.330 --> 00:56.710
is beyond my level
of expertise.

00:57.830 --> 01:00.080
Well, for a friend
of Ragnor's...

01:01.330 --> 01:03.250
...I would do
just about anything.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.380
So... what exactly
do you need?

01:07.380 --> 01:09.330
Well...

01:09.330 --> 01:12.080
I'm looking for something
that could make a person...

01:12.080 --> 01:13.330
fall out of love.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.540
Is that something you could do?

01:17.540 --> 01:19.330
I can...

01:19.330 --> 01:21.210
but I don't recommend it.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.380
You see, heartache,

01:23.380 --> 01:25.290
in all of its
bittersweet torture,

01:25.290 --> 01:27.620
is almost always preferable
to the alternative.

01:27.620 --> 01:30.210
My elixir would erase
everything you've ever felt

01:30.210 --> 01:32.920
for the other person. It would
be almost as if you've...

01:32.920 --> 01:34.380
never loved at all.

01:34.380 --> 01:37.170
Well, it's actually not for me.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.210
It's for a former lover.

01:40.210 --> 01:41.880
A soldier.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.250
I've tried to get him
to move on,

01:44.250 --> 01:46.330
but he's still
madly in love,

01:46.330 --> 01:50.000
and his obsession is starting
to distract him from his duties.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.460
And... well, I worry...

01:52.920 --> 01:55.790
what could happen if he can't
focus on the task at hand.

01:57.170 --> 01:59.080
In the rare case, I suppose...

01:59.080 --> 02:02.250
erasing love is actually
an act of compassion.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.540
An hour before
he drinks this...

02:12.290 --> 02:14.250
...you must add
one last ingredient:

02:14.250 --> 02:16.250
a tiny sliver
of your soul.

02:19.380 --> 02:20.750
My soul

02:20.750 --> 02:23.000
Well, you are the object
of his affection.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.670
In order for the elixir to work,

02:24.670 --> 02:26.290
it must contain a trace of you.

02:27.710 --> 02:30.080
You do know how to perform
an extraction, don't you?

02:31.080 --> 02:32.330
Of course.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.250
Thank you, Mr. Bane.

02:43.290 --> 02:45.580
You really are
a true lifesaver.

From everything I've heard,

03:17.960 --> 03:21.290
my mother suffered
in silence alone for years.

03:21.290 --> 03:23.170
She never got
the help she needed.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.040
We won't make
the same mistake.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.080
Whatever's happening to you,
we're gonna figure it out.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.330
Together.

03:30.380 --> 03:32.380
I'm...thinking of going

03:32.380 --> 03:34.500
to the City of Bones
for treatment.

03:34.500 --> 03:36.330
With the Silent Brothers?

03:37.330 --> 03:39.670
They have a history
of helping Shadowhunters

03:39.670 --> 03:41.040
with mental health issues.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.710
Jace, we don't know that's
what you're going through.

03:43.710 --> 03:45.500
There's a family history.

03:45.500 --> 03:46.790
But you didn't
start feeling this way

03:46.790 --> 03:48.420
until after you were
brought back.

03:48.420 --> 03:50.380
Do you really think
that's a coincidence?

03:50.380 --> 03:52.420
I think it was a trigger...

03:52.420 --> 03:54.830
for something that's
always been there.

03:54.830 --> 03:57.210
Look, I can't sit...

03:57.210 --> 04:00.290
benched and do nothing.
If there is even a chance

04:00.290 --> 04:02.210
that the Silent Brothers
can help, then that's--

04:02.210 --> 04:03.330
But what if they can't?

04:03.330 --> 04:05.500
Jace, the Clave would
deem you unfit for duty.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.830
You'd be deruned.

04:06.830 --> 04:08.460
And what choice do I have?

04:10.250 --> 04:12.250
I can't live like this.

04:16.420 --> 04:19.170
I could try to talk
to the Angel.

04:19.170 --> 04:21.500
No. No, it's too dangerous.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.120
If we summon Raziel,
he could destroy us

04:24.120 --> 04:25.500
just for bothering him.

04:25.500 --> 04:26.500
What about Ithuriel?

04:26.500 --> 04:29.960
He's helped us before.
His blood runs in our veins.

04:29.960 --> 04:32.710
Jace, if you are
suffering the consequences

04:32.710 --> 04:34.040
of being brought back
from the dead,

04:34.040 --> 04:36.460
then... maybe he can
do something.

04:38.620 --> 04:40.420
Well, what are you gonna do?
Are you gonna text him?

04:41.580 --> 04:43.250
I'll... come up with something.

04:44.290 --> 04:45.290
OK?

05:15.920 --> 05:17.580
Is everything OK?

05:17.580 --> 05:18.830
Yeah!

05:18.830 --> 05:20.960
Everything is great.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.210
Just tidying up a bit.

05:23.880 --> 05:25.080
Tidying up?

05:25.080 --> 05:27.580
Why don't you just
snap your fingers?

05:27.580 --> 05:29.330
Well, I find it relaxing.

05:29.330 --> 05:30.460
I suppose I'm odd that way.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.960
You're
odd in a lot ways.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.170
Is that... one of my shirts?

05:37.250 --> 05:40.790
Yeah... Is it...
not my style?

05:40.790 --> 05:42.380
Or your sleeve length.

05:45.460 --> 05:46.960
Better.

05:49.830 --> 05:51.920
Fits perfectly.

05:51.920 --> 05:54.620
But still, I think
it would be nicer...

05:55.620 --> 05:57.080
...if I had one
of my own shirts.

05:57.080 --> 06:00.040
Oh, OK. I think
I can manage that.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.500
No, it's OK.

06:01.500 --> 06:02.920
It fits fine.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.040
It's just I was thinking...

06:04.040 --> 06:05.540
that it wouldn't be an issue
if I didn't have to go

06:05.540 --> 06:07.500
back and forth so much.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.330
I mean I spend
almost every night here.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.080
So... what if I...

06:14.460 --> 06:15.460
...moved in?

06:17.670 --> 06:18.620
Bad idea?

06:18.620 --> 06:20.290
No!

06:20.290 --> 06:22.830
It's... a wonderful idea.

06:26.670 --> 06:27.830
For the future.

06:31.000 --> 06:32.670
OK. Um...

06:32.670 --> 06:34.080
You know, I just thought...

06:34.080 --> 06:36.620
We've been seeing each other
for less than two months.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.960
Alexander, once we
move in together,

06:39.960 --> 06:42.080
our relationship will change.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.040
Yeah. We'll be even closer.

06:44.040 --> 06:45.960
There's no such thing.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.540
If there's one thing
I've learned in the...

06:49.540 --> 06:50.960
course of my long life...

06:52.620 --> 06:54.040
...it's to take your time

06:54.040 --> 06:55.460
OK?

06:55.460 --> 06:56.500
Mm-hmm.

07:00.330 --> 07:02.580
Speaking of time, I gotta go.

07:02.580 --> 07:04.710
I'm already late
for a house-call.

07:04.710 --> 07:05.500
Talk to you tonight?

07:05.500 --> 07:08.120
Yeah.
Yeah!

07:09.500 --> 07:11.420
See you then.
See you.

07:17.420 --> 07:20.080
SIMON: Look, I have no idea
what you're talking about!

07:20.080 --> 07:21.960
I'm telling you,
I never canceled this gig!

07:21.960 --> 07:24.170
WOMAN: Well, someone sure did.
Show's off, end of story.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.790
Come on. No, no, no, no.
Come on, come on, come on!

07:25.790 --> 07:27.330
I already loaded
all of my gear into the van.

07:28.330 --> 07:29.670
Well, can I at least get paid?

07:34.880 --> 07:36.040
What are you doing day

07:36.040 --> 07:37.120
Personal day.

07:37.120 --> 07:38.420
Really? You guys
get personal days?

07:38.420 --> 07:39.540
What was going on there?

07:39.540 --> 07:41.620
I was supposed to play
a show tonight,

07:41.620 --> 07:43.000
but my manager
called and canceled...

07:43.000 --> 07:44.250
except I don't have a manager,

07:44.250 --> 07:46.250
and I actually really
needed that money.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.420
I think Russell and his goons
are trying to sabotage me.

07:49.670 --> 07:52.420
It could be Raphael...
or the Seelie Queen.

07:52.420 --> 07:54.120
You know? Everyone kind of
hates me at the moment.

07:54.120 --> 07:55.670
Popular as always, I see.

07:58.710 --> 07:59.540
What happened?

07:59.540 --> 08:00.710
It's a long story.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.710
The Seelie Queen
did some

08:06.710 --> 08:08.080
plant magic
on my forehead,

08:08.080 --> 08:09.290
and now there's
this mark there

08:09.290 --> 08:10.960
that blasts anyone
who tries to hurt me.

08:12.710 --> 08:14.710
So, you're saying
as much as I'd like to,

08:14.710 --> 08:16.540
I probably shouldn't
deck you right now?

08:16.540 --> 08:18.620
Unless a full body cast
is your idea of a good time,

08:18.620 --> 08:20.120
I'd say no. But, you know what?

08:20.120 --> 08:21.290
One for good measure?

08:21.290 --> 08:23.580
Still, someone may be
trying to mess with you

08:23.580 --> 08:24.750
the only way they can.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.420
You obviously can't
deal with this,

08:27.420 --> 08:28.580
so I'm gonna
figure it out for you.

08:28.580 --> 08:29.960
Since when do you care
about what happens to me?

08:29.960 --> 08:31.670
Mm-mm.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.620
Oh, no. I don't care
what happens to you.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.620
Clary does.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.540
IZZY: Can I borrow a dress?

08:38.540 --> 08:40.710
I need something
mundane to wear.

08:40.710 --> 08:42.170
Going undercover?

08:42.170 --> 08:44.170
Something like that...

08:44.620 --> 08:47.210
: Izzy, is there
something going on?

08:48.210 --> 08:49.790
I'm going out tonight

08:49.790 --> 08:51.080
with the doctor.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.830
Tell me everything.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.210
It's just dinner.

08:54.210 --> 08:56.290
I'm only doing it
so he can leave me alone.

08:56.290 --> 08:58.210
Well, then why go out
with him at all?

08:58.210 --> 09:00.790
You're right. I should cancel.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.960
: Help
with The Owl search.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.790
: Izzy, you've been
working non-stop.

09:03.790 --> 09:06.500
You can take a couple hours
and enjoy yourself.

09:06.500 --> 09:07.460
It'd be good for you.

09:09.750 --> 09:11.880
: Are these
the victims of the Owl?

09:11.880 --> 09:13.920
Yeah. 26 victims in total

09:13.920 --> 09:16.420
throughout the tristate area.
Law enforcement thinks it's

09:16.420 --> 09:18.290
some deranged cult

09:18.290 --> 09:20.620
brainwashing their members
to kill their loved ones.

09:21.500 --> 09:22.670
What's up?

09:23.830 --> 09:25.920
I need to talk to your sister.

09:26.750 --> 09:28.210
Cleophas?

09:30.710 --> 09:32.710
I need an Iron Sister...

09:32.710 --> 09:34.790
and for what I have to do,

09:34.790 --> 09:36.880
I can't go to the Citadel.

09:36.880 --> 09:37.790
What's this all about?

09:39.790 --> 09:40.960
Kiddo, it's me.

09:40.960 --> 09:42.580
You can talk to me
about anything.

09:45.880 --> 09:46.620
Um...

09:48.580 --> 09:50.750
Back at Lake Lyn...

09:50.750 --> 09:53.620
when Jace and I were
battling Valentine...

09:56.620 --> 09:58.040
...Jace wasn't just injured.

10:01.670 --> 10:03.000
He was killed.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.170
What?!

10:05.750 --> 10:06.960
I was

10:06.960 --> 10:08.460
holding him,

10:08.460 --> 10:10.710
dead in my arms, and...

10:10.710 --> 10:12.500
Raziel was right in front of me.

10:12.500 --> 10:14.120
I did the only thing I could.

10:14.120 --> 10:15.670
You had Raziel bring him back?

10:15.670 --> 10:16.960
I had no choice.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.920
Luke, I've been lying.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.790
I've been lying to Alec,

10:22.790 --> 10:25.920
to Izzy, to everyone! It's...
it's eating me up inside.

10:25.920 --> 10:26.920
This is not who I am.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.380
It's OK.
No, it's not.

10:28.380 --> 10:32.170
Because... ever since Jace
has been brought back to life...

10:34.540 --> 10:36.920
...he hasn't been himself.

10:38.750 --> 10:39.920
There is something...

10:40.920 --> 10:43.330
...seriously wrong with him.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.790
And that's why
you need Cleophas?

10:47.880 --> 10:49.880
She can communicate
with the angels, right?

10:50.880 --> 10:52.880
She can ask Ithuriel for help.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.670
Here, boy.

11:17.920 --> 11:19.670
Remember this scent.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.580
Find Clary Fairchild,

11:25.580 --> 11:28.080
and bring me
a sliver of her soul.

11:36.380 --> 11:37.880
Who are you?

11:37.880 --> 11:40.040
I live here. Who are you?

11:40.040 --> 11:41.920
Jace, This is, uh...

11:41.920 --> 11:44.000
Kyle, my roommate.
Kyle, this is Jace.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.540
He's a good friend
of mine.

11:46.540 --> 11:48.250
Friend of a friend.

11:48.250 --> 11:49.540
Mind if I talk
to him in private?

11:49.540 --> 11:50.710
Thanks.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.330
No worries. I was gonna
run to the bodega anyway.

11:55.330 --> 11:56.830
You just went this morning.

11:56.830 --> 11:58.170
Yeah, that was breakfast,
this is lunch.

11:58.170 --> 12:00.380
Do you want
anything?
No, we're good.
Thank you.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.750
I spoke to Luke's pack.

12:05.750 --> 12:07.920
It turns out they like you
even less than I do,

12:07.920 --> 12:09.580
but they did not
cancel your gig.

12:09.580 --> 12:11.620
So I'm guessing
whoever's messing with you,

12:11.620 --> 12:13.710
it has something to do
with that mark on your forehead.

12:13.710 --> 12:15.250
What more can you
tell me about it?

12:15.250 --> 12:18.080
Look, um... I really
appreciate the effort, I do,

12:18.080 --> 12:20.170
but the shockwaves
emanating from my forehead

12:20.170 --> 12:22.790
are all I've been able to think
about until I moved in here.

12:22.790 --> 12:24.540
This place is like my own,

12:24.540 --> 12:26.330
semi-private oasis.

12:26.330 --> 12:27.710
So can...

12:27.710 --> 12:30.000
So can we just play
like, Call of Duty?

12:30.000 --> 12:31.210
Or we've got old-school
Mortal Kombat too,

12:31.210 --> 12:32.580
which is pretty cool.
Mm-hmm.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.210
Is all this stuff yours?

12:35.210 --> 12:37.040
No, it's Kyle's.
So is this sweet Les Paul.

12:37.040 --> 12:39.040
See? This is like, the perfect
apartment for me. Right?

12:39.040 --> 12:40.420
Yeah.

12:41.580 --> 12:43.170
Izzy, I looked through
everything Magnus has

12:43.170 --> 12:44.960
on de-possession.
Nothing matches

12:44.960 --> 12:45.960
Morgan's symptoms.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.380
I'm, uh...

12:48.380 --> 12:49.960
I'm leaving now.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.960
"If anything will keep me safe,

13:35.960 --> 13:37.080
"it's this picture,

13:37.080 --> 13:38.710
"close to my heart.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.750
All my love, George."

13:48.750 --> 13:50.170
I will never get
used to that.

13:51.170 --> 13:53.080
Of all places,
why would she come here?

13:53.080 --> 13:54.920
I brought her here.
It's my farm.

13:54.920 --> 13:57.880
I never knew
you had a farm.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.080
I stayed here for six months,
back when I first turned.

14:00.080 --> 14:01.620
Back when my life fell apart.

14:01.620 --> 14:03.670
That little farm house
is where I put it back together.

14:03.670 --> 14:06.670
Well, let's hope it has
a similar effect on Cleophas.

14:06.670 --> 14:08.580
I wouldn't know.
I haven't heard from her

14:08.580 --> 14:10.880
since I brought her here.
She's cut herself off.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.710
I can't say
I blame her.

14:13.710 --> 14:16.500
Being held captive
by Valentine, poisoned...

14:16.500 --> 14:17.920
It's terrible.

14:25.920 --> 14:26.920
Cleo?

14:26.920 --> 14:28.750
It's Lucian.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.380
Clarissa...

14:46.080 --> 14:47.460
You're telling me this guy

14:47.460 --> 14:49.000
almost runs you over...

14:49.000 --> 14:50.330
Will you stop?
....and then
he just happens

14:50.330 --> 14:51.960
to have a room
in his apartment...
OK, will you stop?

14:51.960 --> 14:54.620
...and that just happens to be
full of all your favorite stuff?

14:54.620 --> 14:56.080
Yes. I guess
I just got lucky.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.500
I don't believe in luck.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.540
Is that his room?

14:58.540 --> 15:00.170
No, it's this one. Wait, why?

15:00.170 --> 15:02.120
I told you I was gonna
figure out what's going on.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.790
Wait, what
What are you doing?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.620
No! No, look!

15:07.620 --> 15:09.120
Please don't ruin this
for me, Jace!

15:09.120 --> 15:10.920
Come on!
I know what I'm doing.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.960
Oh, see? Totally normal.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.170
You really think it's normal
for a guy to have

15:20.170 --> 15:22.170
all that out there
and none of it in here?

15:22.170 --> 15:24.540
OK, so an uncluttered bedroom
means he's trying

15:24.540 --> 15:26.210
trying to honey I mean,

15:26.210 --> 15:28.040
maybe the guy's just...

15:28.040 --> 15:30.000
I don't know,
really into feng shui.

15:31.380 --> 15:33.330
And now you're going through
his underwear drawer?!

15:33.330 --> 15:34.960
Look, Jace, you're
looking for something

15:34.960 --> 15:36.170
where there's nothing.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.040
Maybe not.

15:41.040 --> 15:44.380
So he grows his own stuff.
Maybe he has a card.

15:44.380 --> 15:46.500
You know it's
medically legal now.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.880
You have no idea
what this is.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.830
And what do you think this is?!

15:49.830 --> 15:50.920
OK.

15:50.920 --> 15:52.040
This looks bad,
but there's like,

15:52.040 --> 15:53.830
a perfectly reasonable
explanation...

15:53.830 --> 15:54.960
Hey, whoa! Jace, what the hell?!

15:55.960 --> 15:57.290
Get off me!

15:59.580 --> 16:02.000
That plant
is wolfsbane, Simon.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.580
Your friend Kyle here
is a werewolf.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.420
Aren't you, Kyle?

16:14.210 --> 16:15.420
Who are you?

16:15.420 --> 16:17.040
What pack are you with?

16:20.040 --> 16:22.120
I don't have to explain
myself to you.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.250
You really should.
And what about me?

16:24.250 --> 16:26.250
You've been lying to me
this whole time?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.120
I'm Praetor Lupus.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.500
Who's that?

16:29.500 --> 16:31.210
It's not a who,

16:31.210 --> 16:32.540
it's a what.

16:32.540 --> 16:33.830
OK, then what is it?!

16:33.830 --> 16:36.670
It's a secret organization
of wolves.

16:36.670 --> 16:39.040
Guardians...

16:39.040 --> 16:41.580
They only intervene
in special Downworld cases.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.250
I've never actually met one.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.170
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

16:47.170 --> 16:49.120
We heard about
the blast of energy

16:49.120 --> 16:50.830
Simon unleashed
on Lucian Graymark's pack.

16:54.120 --> 16:55.960
I was sent in to assist.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.290
Whoa! Whoa! Just like that,
we're cool now?

17:00.290 --> 17:01.620
He's doing his job.

17:01.620 --> 17:02.670
I'm not a job!

17:05.290 --> 17:07.210
The other day, when you...

17:07.210 --> 17:09.080
ran into me, you planned that?

17:12.120 --> 17:14.620
And this... this apartment,
it's just a trap?

17:14.620 --> 17:17.290
We designed this place for you
so you'd want to stay here...

17:17.290 --> 17:18.420
where it's safe.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.750
You called off my gig?

17:23.920 --> 17:25.960
Look... until I can
figure out how to keep

17:25.960 --> 17:27.120
you and everybody else
from getting hurt,

17:27.120 --> 17:29.080
this is where you need to be.
I don't need someone

17:29.080 --> 17:31.170
to protect me. I need people
to tell me the truth!

17:31.170 --> 17:33.290
Well, I was going
to tell you the truth...

17:33.290 --> 17:35.420
when the time was right.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.580
After all the trouble you've
had with the New York pack,

17:39.580 --> 17:41.330
if I told you I was a wolf,
would you have listened to me?

17:41.330 --> 17:42.620
Probably!

17:42.620 --> 17:44.960
Sorry, call me crazy,
but I tend to respect people

17:44.960 --> 17:46.040
that are honest with me.

17:46.040 --> 17:47.210
You need to calm down.

17:47.210 --> 17:48.250
Whose side are you on?!

17:51.920 --> 17:53.290
You know what? I'm done.

17:53.290 --> 17:54.830
Consider this me
breaking my lease.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.830
Ahem. Is now
not a good time, sir?

18:11.080 --> 18:12.250
No, it's fine.

18:12.250 --> 18:13.920
What is it?

18:13.920 --> 18:15.210
I wanted to report
that the main systems

18:15.210 --> 18:16.620
have been updated and rebooted.

18:16.620 --> 18:18.080
Great. Thank you.

18:26.830 --> 18:27.960
Is there something else?

18:29.420 --> 18:30.750
I, uh...

18:30.750 --> 18:32.580
actually just wanted
to thank you.

18:32.580 --> 18:33.830
For what?

18:33.830 --> 18:36.210
For paving the way
for Shadowhunters like me.

18:38.460 --> 18:40.620
I've been on the front lines
for over 10 years,

18:40.620 --> 18:44.500
but I've always had to keep
my private life separate.

18:48.580 --> 18:51.250
If it wasn't for you,
I don't know

18:51.250 --> 18:53.290
if I ever would've been able
to come out at the Institute.

18:55.420 --> 18:57.170
Oh.

18:58.330 --> 19:00.080
Your... your courage...

19:01.080 --> 19:02.210
sir, it's inspiring.

19:03.380 --> 19:05.380
I mean, here you are, in this...

19:05.380 --> 19:08.460
committed relationship,
with a warlock no less.

19:08.460 --> 19:11.710
It's loving and it's
trusting. It's amazing.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.120
Yeah. It is.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.080
Ithuriel...

19:19.080 --> 19:20.210
he helped us before.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.210
And you think
he could help again.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.960
Iron Sisters do have ways to
communicate with the angels.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.540
But I'm afraid I cannot
do that for you.

19:32.540 --> 19:34.460
You can't, or you won't?

19:36.460 --> 19:38.420
I have been trying
to contact the angels,

19:38.420 --> 19:40.290
but as hard as I try,

19:40.290 --> 19:41.710
they will not answer.

19:41.710 --> 19:43.960
Why?
I'm not certain.

19:43.960 --> 19:46.920
I sometimes wonder
if my own...

19:46.920 --> 19:50.250
irredeemable actions have
severed my ties to the heavens.

19:52.290 --> 19:53.330
I'm useless.

19:55.290 --> 19:57.000
But you, Clarissa...

19:58.290 --> 20:00.420
...you are far from useless.

20:00.420 --> 20:01.830
What do you mean?

20:03.330 --> 20:05.000
You may not be
an Iron Sister,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.580
but Ithuriel's blood
runs through you,

20:08.580 --> 20:11.000
You think I can
summon Ithuriel?

20:15.460 --> 20:18.000
No one other than an Iron Sister
has done it before.

20:18.000 --> 20:19.710
There may be risks...

20:19.710 --> 20:21.000
but it's certainly
worth a try.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.460
What risks?

20:22.460 --> 20:24.420
- There's a chance
it could anger Ithuriel.

20:24.420 --> 20:25.420
He could lash out at her.

20:25.420 --> 20:27.170
He's never hurt me before.

20:27.170 --> 20:29.290
He chose those moments
to appear to you.

20:29.290 --> 20:31.330
Summoning an Angel

20:31.330 --> 20:33.120
is a whole different story.

20:34.210 --> 20:36.580
Clary, I know
this is important,

20:36.580 --> 20:38.330
but so are you.

20:38.330 --> 20:40.000
So is Jace.

20:45.880 --> 20:48.330
: So, why did you
become a doctor

20:48.330 --> 20:49.580
if you were scared of blood?

20:49.580 --> 20:50.960
Both my parents
are doctors.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.210
And let's just say,

20:52.210 --> 20:55.040
they made it clear
from a very young age

20:55.040 --> 20:57.000
that I was going to follow
in their footsteps.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.330
They call medicine
"the family business."

21:00.330 --> 21:01.620
But, I mean,
enough about me.

21:01.620 --> 21:03.080
What about you?

21:03.080 --> 21:05.460
I feel like I know
nothing about you.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.540
Except for the fact
that you apparently

21:07.540 --> 21:09.210
have a thing for snakes

21:09.210 --> 21:10.920
or serpents or...

21:10.920 --> 21:12.580
whatever that is
on your bracelet.

21:12.580 --> 21:14.620
Right.
It's cool.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.580
You know, actually, I...

21:16.580 --> 21:18.420
made this one.

21:19.420 --> 21:20.580
Really? I mean...

21:20.580 --> 21:22.040
You got some serious talent.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.380
Is that what you do for work?

21:24.580 --> 21:26.790
What?
You make jewelry?

21:29.210 --> 21:30.420
Yes.

21:30.420 --> 21:32.540
I, uh... make jewelry.

21:32.540 --> 21:33.960
So you're an artist.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.170
Sweet!

21:36.170 --> 21:37.330
So how does it work?

21:37.330 --> 21:38.540
Do you...

21:38.540 --> 21:40.170
Do you work from a store?

21:40.170 --> 21:42.540
No, uh, I actually...

21:42.540 --> 21:43.540
work from home.

21:43.540 --> 21:45.210
That must be peaceful.

21:45.210 --> 21:46.420
Not at all.

21:46.420 --> 21:47.580
No?

21:47.580 --> 21:49.460
I... live with my family.

21:49.460 --> 21:50.960
My brothers.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.080
We all... work together.

21:53.080 --> 21:54.710
Family business?

21:56.790 --> 21:58.420
We have more in common
than I thought.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.170
Thank you so much for tonight.

22:15.170 --> 22:16.960
I really had
an incredible time.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.170
You sound so surprised.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.170
I just... don't normally
do things like this.

22:22.170 --> 22:24.960
Well... I know a great place
downtown. Hell's Kitchen.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.040
One more drink?

22:26.960 --> 22:27.960
Let's go.

22:27.960 --> 22:29.170
Let me get us a ride.

22:34.880 --> 22:36.290
Hey! Charlie...
Yeah?

22:36.290 --> 22:37.330
I have to go.

22:37.330 --> 22:38.460
Wait, what?

22:38.460 --> 22:39.620
I just remembered,
I have an order

22:39.620 --> 22:40.380
I have to get out tonight.

22:40.380 --> 22:41.210
But...

22:41.210 --> 22:42.460
It's an important client.

22:43.170 --> 22:44.540
Alright. Let me at least
get you a ride.

22:44.540 --> 22:45.580
I'm sorry.

22:45.580 --> 22:46.580
I have to go.

23:37.580 --> 23:39.040
Seriously?

24:07.380 --> 24:09.290
Dumb, useless demon.

24:11.790 --> 24:13.420
Where are you
going, Mother?

24:13.420 --> 24:16.170
It appears I'll have to get
my hands dirty after all.

24:35.330 --> 24:36.170
CHARLIE: Isabelle?

24:38.540 --> 24:39.920
Isabelle!

24:43.790 --> 24:44.540
What happened?

24:45.750 --> 24:46.960
You okay?
- I...

24:46.960 --> 24:48.750
My heel broke
and I tripped.

24:48.750 --> 24:49.960
Let me see.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.580
Hmm-mmm. You need
to go to the hospital.

24:53.580 --> 24:55.750
No, really,
there's no need.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.120
I... I'm fine.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.000
Not with this cut.
You need stitches.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.290
You're coming with me.

25:03.330 --> 25:04.580
Is this yours?

25:04.580 --> 25:05.750
Kind of looks
like your style.

25:06.920 --> 25:08.330
Yes.
Yeah?

25:08.330 --> 25:09.290
Thank you.

25:09.290 --> 25:11.210
Alright, come on.
OK.

25:23.380 --> 25:24.750
This contains
trace amounts of adamas,

25:24.750 --> 25:26.620
to help call the Angels.

25:39.670 --> 25:41.620
Activate your angelic rune.

25:47.120 --> 25:48.540
Now, repeat after me.

25:48.540 --> 25:50.750
Ignis aurum probat...

25:51.920 --> 25:54.120
Ignis aurum probat...

25:54.750 --> 25:57.170
Ita probat me...

25:57.170 --> 25:59.750
Ita probat me.

26:06.040 --> 26:07.120
They've heard you.

26:08.120 --> 26:09.040
What happens now?

26:09.040 --> 26:10.710
For you to hear them,

26:10.710 --> 26:12.670
we have to leave you here.

26:12.670 --> 26:13.670
Leave her here?

26:13.670 --> 26:14.920
No way.

26:14.920 --> 26:16.290
You're a Downworlder,

26:16.290 --> 26:18.120
and I murdered
an Iron Sister.

26:19.120 --> 26:20.960
How do you think the Angel's
gonna react to us?

26:20.960 --> 26:22.540
Luke...

26:22.540 --> 26:24.210
I'll be OK.

26:27.420 --> 26:28.710
May the Angel be
with you.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.170
Whoa!

27:07.420 --> 27:08.920
I'm just trying
to help the homeless.

27:08.920 --> 27:09.710
Yeah. Very funny.

27:09.710 --> 27:11.880
Now, leave me alone.

27:12.880 --> 27:14.080
I'm keeping this
by the way.

27:15.080 --> 27:16.710
Are you seriously
gonna live in your van?

27:16.710 --> 27:18.380
I don't know.
But at least my van

27:18.380 --> 27:19.670
is not going to spy
on me while I sleep.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.290
Look... I'll find
another place.

27:23.290 --> 27:25.710
I just don't wanna be a prisoner
of the Wolves Templar.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.420
I think that's a bit extreme.

27:27.420 --> 27:28.250
Lying to me?

27:29.120 --> 27:31.080
I don't agree
with his tactics,

27:31.080 --> 27:32.710
but Kyle
did apologized to you.

27:33.500 --> 27:34.540
Look...

27:34.540 --> 27:37.000
I understand
the situation isn't perfect,

27:38.920 --> 27:40.750
but if someone's
offering you help...

27:43.880 --> 27:45.500
...you'd be a fool
not to take it.

27:56.080 --> 27:57.210
I tried calling.

27:57.210 --> 27:58.670
I've been busy.

28:02.080 --> 28:04.040
Magnus, I did something
I'm not proud of.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.080
You're referring
to going through that box?

28:08.830 --> 28:10.120
I'm a warlock.

28:10.120 --> 28:12.120
I know when things
are out of order.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.080
I had no right.

28:16.080 --> 28:17.880
It was an invasion
of your privacy,

28:17.880 --> 28:19.500
and I'm sorry.

28:20.880 --> 28:22.120
Apology accepted.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.540
George...

28:28.540 --> 28:31.710
He... must be special.

28:33.920 --> 28:34.920
He was.

28:34.920 --> 28:36.540
A brave soldier,

28:36.540 --> 28:37.880
like someone else I know.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.170
Shall I whip us up
some cocktails?

28:47.170 --> 28:48.460
Martini Mondays.

28:48.460 --> 28:49.920
Gin or vodka?
Gin.

28:49.920 --> 28:51.880
Gin.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.290
You're not jealous,
are you?

29:01.880 --> 29:04.750
You were weird before
when I asked about moving in.

29:09.080 --> 29:10.750
Is he still?
The man's

29:10.750 --> 29:12.170
been dead over a century.

29:13.670 --> 29:17.080
Oh, why do you keep
so much of his stuff?

29:17.080 --> 29:18.420
Alexander,

29:18.420 --> 29:21.880
the contents in that box,
they're not George's.

29:23.290 --> 29:24.920
I only have
that single
photograph.

29:26.040 --> 29:27.420
Then what is all that?

29:30.710 --> 29:34.460
Each of those belonged
to someone I loved and outlived.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.330
A different committed
relationship for each one.

29:41.880 --> 29:42.960
Why do you keep it?

29:42.960 --> 29:45.460
I may be magical,

29:45.460 --> 29:48.080
but my memory's
far from it.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.170
I keep those mementos
to remember them by.

29:50.170 --> 29:53.460
Look, Alec,
you know my history.

29:53.460 --> 29:55.460
I've always been honest
with you about that.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.500
- Well...

29:57.920 --> 30:00.080
Now that I've seen some of
that history with my own eyes,

30:00.080 --> 30:03.000
I can't help but think --
if I'm lucky,

30:03.000 --> 30:04.920
maybe one of my arrowheads
ends up in that box.

30:04.920 --> 30:06.830
Look, I don't even want to
think about you being gone--

30:06.830 --> 30:10.080
- But one day I will be.
And you'll just, move on--

30:10.080 --> 30:11.250
- I'm immortal!

30:13.170 --> 30:15.790
It's not as if I have a choice.
I can't change what I am,
and neither can you.

30:20.540 --> 30:21.540
Look...

30:22.960 --> 30:25.880
...can we just stay
in the here and now?

30:27.710 --> 30:28.710
Hmm?

30:29.670 --> 30:32.380
Look, I want to cherish
this moment...

30:33.620 --> 30:35.080
with the one I love

30:43.880 --> 30:47.000
You're right.
I love you, too.

30:52.540 --> 30:56.290
Good. Now, don't you
go anywhere,

30:56.290 --> 30:58.040
I'll be right back
with those martinis.

31:10.330 --> 31:11.710
There you go.

31:11.710 --> 31:13.960
Hey. That's it?

31:13.960 --> 31:15.620
- That's it.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.120
Wasn't so bad, was it?

31:17.120 --> 31:19.540
No, it actually
kind of tickled.

31:20.620 --> 31:22.330
You never had
stitches before, huh?

31:22.330 --> 31:23.420
Never needed them.

31:24.500 --> 31:27.580
So, how does this work?
Who do I pay?

31:27.580 --> 31:28.710
Do I pay you?
Oh, no, no.

31:28.710 --> 31:30.250
Just... it's
on the house.

31:30.250 --> 31:33.000
Consider it my way of saying
I'm sorry, for coming on

31:33.000 --> 31:34.080
too strong before.

31:34.080 --> 31:35.710
- You didn't come on
too strong.

31:35.710 --> 31:38.790
Isn't that why
you took off running?

31:38.790 --> 31:41.000
- No. I really did
have work to do.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.000
Actually, I still do.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.540
I have to go. Yeah.

31:46.540 --> 31:47.710
- Got it.

31:56.170 --> 31:58.120
Why did you come
looking for me

31:58.120 --> 32:00.500
after I ditched you
like that?

32:00.500 --> 32:03.580
With all the cult-member
killings in the news, I...

32:06.080 --> 32:08.960
I don't know. I...
When I saw you disappear

32:08.960 --> 32:10.540
down that alley,
I needed

32:10.540 --> 32:12.120
to make sure
that you were OK.

32:15.380 --> 32:16.380
Thank you.

32:24.330 --> 32:26.000
For the stitches.

32:35.250 --> 32:38.210
It's been too long.
What's going on out there?

32:38.210 --> 32:39.790
Patience, Lucian.

32:39.790 --> 32:42.250
Look, I can keep my distance
and still keep an eye on her.

32:42.250 --> 32:43.580
Remember
when we were kids

32:43.580 --> 32:46.080
and our neighbour
got that big German shepherd?

32:47.170 --> 32:48.170
Brutus.

32:49.170 --> 32:50.880
I hated that damn dog.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.540
You were terrified of it.
Like it was a some Shax Demon.

32:53.540 --> 32:55.750
You refused to walk past
that house.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.250
Remember what
I said to you?

32:58.250 --> 33:01.000
Yeah. You said
to have faith.

33:02.250 --> 33:04.000
And when you did walk past it,
what happened?

33:11.170 --> 33:12.170
He licked me.

33:12.170 --> 33:14.080
Have faith in Clary,
big brother.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.290
I know I do.

33:46.830 --> 33:50.460
Clary, you should
not be here.

33:50.460 --> 33:53.290
Ithuriel, I'm sorry
to have summoned you.

33:53.290 --> 33:55.120
I understand
if you're angry.

33:56.830 --> 33:58.290
It's all right, my child.

34:00.830 --> 34:01.830
I'm here for you.

34:03.750 --> 34:05.540
You've come
because of Jace.

34:07.210 --> 34:09.330
You know what happened?

34:09.330 --> 34:10.620
I do.

34:10.620 --> 34:12.040
I need to know...

34:14.460 --> 34:15.620
...is Jace...

34:18.040 --> 34:21.750
...the way he is
because of what I did?

34:21.750 --> 34:23.210
No.

34:25.620 --> 34:28.170
But returning from death
has left him vulnerable.

34:28.170 --> 34:31.000
You now face a greater
threat than you realize.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.960
I... I don't understand...

34:32.960 --> 34:35.920
A great evil has arrived
in the realm of the mundane.

34:37.210 --> 34:38.210
The Owl?

34:38.210 --> 34:40.960
The Owl has a master.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.620
Its name is--

34:43.620 --> 34:44.960
AAAH!

35:15.920 --> 35:17.420
What are you?!

35:40.420 --> 35:43.460
It's OK, it's OK. You're gonna
be alright. Come on.

35:44.460 --> 35:45.670
What happened
out there?

35:47.210 --> 35:48.460
Did Ithuriel appear?

35:48.460 --> 35:49.460
Ithuriel...

36:02.580 --> 36:03.540
You're back.

36:03.540 --> 36:04.830
Forgot my keyboard.

36:04.830 --> 36:05.830
Simon, we need to talk.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.920
OK, but later and

36:07.920 --> 36:09.750
only if I can
borrow the guitar.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.040
Why? Where are you
going with my stuff?

36:11.040 --> 36:13.040
- I got my gig back, no thanks
to you. I go in an hour.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.080
Are you... are you
out of your mind?

36:15.080 --> 36:16.330
That place is gonna be
crawling with wolves!

36:16.330 --> 36:19.420
Which is why I plan on using
my most ultimate weapon.

36:19.420 --> 36:21.380
The power of music!

36:21.380 --> 36:24.330
Do you think this is funny?
Huh? All it takes is

36:24.330 --> 36:26.250
for one of them to come
at you and that bomb
on your head goes off.

36:26.250 --> 36:28.460
Do you really want to be
responsible for that?

36:28.460 --> 36:30.290
Honestly, I'm not
that worried about it.

36:30.290 --> 36:32.250
Besides, I've got you
to stop them, don't I?

36:33.500 --> 36:35.000
What are you talking about?

36:35.000 --> 36:36.500
I'm still not over the fact
that you lied to me,

36:36.500 --> 36:37.960
but I'm willing
to give you a chance.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.420
You want to help me, I'm in,

36:39.420 --> 36:41.960
but only on my terms.
Not how the Prateors works.

36:41.960 --> 36:44.710
That's too bad. I'm still
gonna go on living my life.

36:44.710 --> 36:46.500
So either you can help,
or you can

36:46.500 --> 36:49.170
go back to wherever the Praetors
come from... your call.

36:59.620 --> 37:00.960
You got a minute?

37:01.750 --> 37:02.750
Yeah.

37:04.170 --> 37:05.670
You all right?

37:07.540 --> 37:08.580
It's nothing.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.290
It's nothing?

37:16.460 --> 37:19.250
Just stuff with Magnus. Nothing
I'd want to bore you with.

37:22.580 --> 37:24.380
So how are you?

37:24.380 --> 37:26.290
Heard you took
the day off.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.120
Yeah.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.460
I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

37:33.460 --> 37:36.540
About what's been
going on with me and...

37:40.540 --> 37:43.500
...I've decided to go
to the Silent City
for treatment.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.580
You were the one who told me
I needed to get some help.

37:49.420 --> 37:51.120
I'm sorry.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.120
Jace, if this doesn't
work, you realize--

37:57.120 --> 38:00.420
I know. At least, I'll know
I tried everything, right?

38:03.460 --> 38:04.710
I'm going with you.

38:07.250 --> 38:08.330
I'll be by your side
the whole time.

38:10.710 --> 38:12.460
You know you can't do that,
they won't let you.

38:13.580 --> 38:15.880
This is one fight
I have to face on my own.

38:32.460 --> 38:34.880
Clary, where are you?

38:37.250 --> 38:39.460
I've decided to go
to the Silent City.

38:41.500 --> 38:42.580
Just call me.

38:45.620 --> 38:46.830
Hey, uh...

38:47.880 --> 38:50.380
...Praetor. Have you
seen a Shadowhunter?

38:50.380 --> 38:52.580
She got long red hair.

38:52.580 --> 38:54.830
Yeah, I know who
Clary Fairchild is.

38:54.830 --> 38:55.960
Haven't seen her though.

38:57.830 --> 38:59.170
Alright, hey!

38:59.170 --> 39:00.750
I'm Simon Lewis.

39:00.750 --> 39:03.080
It was a long road
to get here tonight,

39:03.080 --> 39:06.960
but I made it.
Thanks to my roady/roommate.

39:06.960 --> 39:09.120
MAN: All right! Yeah!

39:12.250 --> 39:14.170
♪ Help me ♪

Could you do a girl a favour
and get me one of those?

39:40.080 --> 39:43.120
I'd love to..

39:43.120 --> 39:44.670
...but I don't think
my girlfriend would like that

39:44.670 --> 39:47.420
very much.
I didn't mean it like
that, it's just...

39:48.670 --> 39:51.380
you seem to be the only
person who can get any
service around here.

39:52.380 --> 39:53.500
Right.

39:53.500 --> 39:54.710
Let's get one.

40:02.210 --> 40:03.460
Thank you.

40:07.330 --> 40:09.500
Whoever she is,
she must be wonderful.

40:11.670 --> 40:13.120
Yeah, she is.

40:14.580 --> 40:16.080
To true love.

40:32.380 --> 40:33.580
Very good.

40:35.540 --> 40:37.620
Now, nothing
will come between us.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.500
How do you feel?

40:42.580 --> 40:43.750
Like a new man.
