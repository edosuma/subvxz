00:08.591 --> 00:14.514
This is apparently a...
one-to-72-inch scale model...

00:17.892 --> 00:19.394
of my ride to space.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.235
<i>Good afternoon
from Mission Control, Houston,</i>

00:27.402 --> 00:29.320
<i>and welcome
to NASA Television's live coverage</i>

00:29.404 --> 00:31.281
<i>of the launch of Expedition 35.</i>

00:34.325 --> 00:36.745
<i>I have flown in space,
two previous times.</i>

00:38.455 --> 00:40.331
<i>My last mission was seven years ago.</i>

00:44.627 --> 00:48.506
<i>We get 15 guests allowed
to come and watch.</i>

00:50.467 --> 00:54.596
<i>Your family, your loved ones, your spouse,
your children, your best friends.</i>

00:57.974 --> 00:59.350
<i>It's a whole bunch of emotions.</i>

00:59.517 --> 01:01.644
<i>You're proud, because
you just saw your family,</i>

01:01.770 --> 01:03.938
<i>and they're happy and proud for you.</i>

01:06.649 --> 01:09.694
<i>The crew members wave goodbye
as we count down to launch.</i>

01:10.403 --> 01:12.989
We climb in the elevator,
it takes us all the way up to the top.

01:17.577 --> 01:21.539
The Soyuz itself is up under here,
underneath these, uh, these fairings.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.918
<i>T-minus 20 seconds and counting.</i>

01:25.543 --> 01:27.003
<i>We climb in there one by one,</i>

01:27.879 --> 01:30.673
close the door, and load up.

01:31.674 --> 01:33.301
<i>Everything's in order,
we're ready for launch.</i>

01:33.510 --> 01:36.054
<i>Copy.
And blast off.</i>

01:39.849 --> 01:41.643
<i>We have ignition of the Soyuz...</i>

01:43.061 --> 01:44.479
<i>and liftoff.</i>

02:13.424 --> 02:14.884
Hi, good morning.
Hi there.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.394
Hey, Steph, how are you, good?
Good to see you.

02:24.519 --> 02:25.812
- Did you see that?
Yes, I did.

02:25.895 --> 02:26.980
Isn't that cool?

02:28.022 --> 02:29.566
<i>I'll be launching on April 9th,</i>

02:30.400 --> 02:33.027
<i>so the next stop is Moscow for training,</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:36.156
<i>and then onto Kazakhstan
for the launch itself.</i>

02:37.323 --> 02:39.576
I hear there's a flat me sitting there,
sitting around here somewhere,

02:39.659 --> 02:40.952
- that I'm supposed to grab.
- Yes, yes.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.579
- We'll catch you later.
Good job.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.247
- See you guys.
- Okay, Chris.

02:45.540 --> 02:46.749
Official portrait.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.962
What do you think?
Ready to go? Yup, all right.

02:55.216 --> 02:57.135
All right, welcome, everyone.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.596
The whole point of this meeting
is Chris is about to go

03:00.263 --> 03:03.391
travel off into somewhere
called space pretty soon.

03:03.474 --> 03:05.059
And before he leaves Houston for a while,

03:05.185 --> 03:06.978
I just wanna make sure
the whole team gets together,

03:07.312 --> 03:09.647
gets to talk to Chris,
Chris has a few words to say.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.649
I wanted to just meet
with everybody.

03:12.066 --> 03:16.112
We... We'd joke around
a lot, back in Expedition 35,

03:16.446 --> 03:20.658
how I like to make stuff gray
on the timeline.

03:20.783 --> 03:23.286
And I remember that was
a very satisfying feeling,

03:23.369 --> 03:26.247
when the activity's done,
turning that sucker gray,

03:26.331 --> 03:27.999
and moving on to the next thing.

03:28.374 --> 03:31.794
So I made some T-shirts that are...

03:33.922 --> 03:37.967
one-of-a-kind, nobody else at JSC's
gonna have them except you guys.

03:39.135 --> 03:42.388
"I love making things grey," so...

03:43.139 --> 03:45.808
<i>It's really nice to get together
with the flight control team</i>

03:45.975 --> 03:48.645
<i>that I'll be working
with on... on a daily basis.</i>

03:49.896 --> 03:54.317
So in the military, we have this tradition
where units have a coin.

03:54.776 --> 03:58.613
Uh, the proper way to give it
is with a handshake, and...

03:58.905 --> 04:01.199
so to each of you guys,
thank you very much.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.995
<i>It's just really nice
to feel that camaraderie,</i>

04:06.079 --> 04:08.498
<i>that bond between the crew
and the flight control team</i>

04:08.581 --> 04:10.291
<i>before getting back to the space station.</i>

04:14.879 --> 04:16.464
All right, dude. Catch you later.

04:17.799 --> 04:18.925
See you later, Mark.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.426
That's it, I'm out.

04:20.718 --> 04:24.889
So you just kind of catch it up,
catch the goodbyes as you can.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.948
You havin' peach?
- Yeah, I'll have peach.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.202
<i>Yesterday, we met
with family support people</i>

04:46.327 --> 04:49.664
<i>that organize all of the activities
leading up to launch.</i>

04:50.915 --> 04:53.418
<i>When you start involving
your launch guests,</i>

04:53.543 --> 04:55.753
and actually really looking
at the calendar

04:55.837 --> 04:58.006
and planning on this date
and this date,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.466
and you'll arrive here,
and I'll be here,

05:00.550 --> 05:02.468
and, you know, talking about
very specific things,

05:03.261 --> 05:07.640
then it just gets this air of,
"Oh, wow. It's really happening."

05:07.932 --> 05:10.518
It's a lot of stuff,
it's just fantastic support,

05:10.601 --> 05:12.937
and it's a little overwhelming, right?
When you first get it.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.063
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

05:14.147 --> 05:15.648
What kind
of stuff do they talk about?

05:16.024 --> 05:19.485
Just what kind of support
I get up to launch, through launch,

05:20.111 --> 05:23.489
and then, um,
the six months that he's gone.

05:23.948 --> 05:25.658
And they talked about,
like, what'll happen

05:25.742 --> 05:28.453
if it's a bad day,
if something doesn't go right,

05:28.536 --> 05:33.124
then what... what your astronaut escort
will do for you,

05:33.207 --> 05:36.586
like, put you in your own van,
and get you away from there real quick.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.838
There was a few times
I actually got tears in my eyes

05:39.005 --> 05:41.049
- because it was real.
Yeah.

05:41.132 --> 05:42.967
You know, just listening
to them talk about...

05:43.301 --> 05:45.053
Okay, and at this point he'll suit up,

05:45.136 --> 05:46.804
and then you'll get to see him
when he suits up,

05:46.888 --> 05:48.222
and that'll be the last time

05:48.389 --> 05:50.641
you'll like, physically
be in front of him, and...

05:51.225 --> 05:52.477
But it's exciting, right?

05:53.144 --> 05:56.814
- It is right now.

06:12.997 --> 06:16.292
<i>My name is Dan Huot.
I'm a public affairs officer at NASA,</i>

06:16.834 --> 06:18.628
<i>that basically means I talk about space.</i>

06:20.546 --> 06:24.467
<i>Part of NASA's mission is telling
the whole world what we're doing.</i>

06:26.135 --> 06:28.429
Welcome to
<i>Space to Ground,</i> I'm Dan Huot.

06:28.888 --> 06:32.141
<i>One of my favorite parts of the job
has always been commentary.</i>

06:32.642 --> 06:33.851
Ready.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.436
<i>And lift off.</i>

06:35.520 --> 06:39.440
<i>So, any time somebody's launching,
and if we're doing space blogs,</i>

06:39.565 --> 06:42.360
you're just basically doing
play-by-play of what's happening.

06:42.568 --> 06:45.613
And good morning, once again,
from Mission Control, Houston...

06:45.738 --> 06:50.159
The last time Chris did a spacewalk,
I was doing the live commentary.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.872
<i>Continuing to standby
as we wait on a decision</i>

06:55.456 --> 06:57.583
<i>on whether or not this build-up of water</i>

06:57.834 --> 06:59.585
<i>in Luca Parmitano's helmet
will be an issue</i>

06:59.669 --> 07:01.170
<i>for continuing this space walk.</i>

07:02.130 --> 07:04.715
<i>In moments like that,
you get a snap realization</i>

07:05.299 --> 07:08.094
<i>that just how dangerous
the business can be.</i>

07:09.429 --> 07:13.057
<i>I see first-hand
things that very few people</i>

07:13.141 --> 07:14.642
<i>on this planet will ever see.</i>

07:15.518 --> 07:17.395
Two of the three out of the capsule now.

07:17.979 --> 07:21.607
This thing was in space
like 20 minutes ago!

07:21.691 --> 07:22.692
I'm gonna touch it.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.240
<i>It's gonna be awesome,
seeing Chris launch.</i>

07:29.782 --> 07:33.369
<i>I'm gonna do the commentary,
so I'm really looking forward to it.</i>

07:36.372 --> 07:42.378
Since the shuttle retired in 2011,
we buy seats on the Soyuz from Russia.

07:42.795 --> 07:45.298
<i>It's around 80 million per seat.</i>

07:45.673 --> 07:48.176
<i>Now, that includes the ride up and down,</i>

07:48.259 --> 07:52.221
<i>and all of the training and all
the other logistics that come with it.</i>

07:52.805 --> 07:56.517
And when you're flying on Soyuz,
you do all of that training

07:56.601 --> 07:58.019
over in Star City, Russia.

08:16.996 --> 08:18.164
<i>We're gonna go over here.</i>

08:21.209 --> 08:23.544
<i>This is the
Cosmonaut Training Center in Star City,</i>

08:23.628 --> 08:26.964
<i>and this is the Russian portion
of my training preparation.</i>

08:30.927 --> 08:32.887
He's one of my favorite instructors.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.892
<i>I've been an astronaut for over 15 years,</i>

08:37.975 --> 08:41.562
and probably coming here
for 12 of those years.

08:43.648 --> 08:47.193
<i>The cottages are very comfortable,
and I know all the people.</i>

08:48.236 --> 08:50.112
<i>So I really, really enjoy coming here.</i>

09:01.290 --> 09:04.752
<i>Star City, to me,
is this interesting mix of buildings</i>

09:04.835 --> 09:07.380
<i>that have been around since
the dawn of space flight,</i>

09:08.297 --> 09:12.635
<i>mixed with high-tech space equipment,</i>

09:13.219 --> 09:16.889
and it's fascinating to think
about the mix of the old and the new.

09:30.319 --> 09:33.322
<i>When you think of
the Space Race, it was contentious.</i>

09:35.032 --> 09:38.077
<i>It was us trying to beat another country.</i>

09:38.995 --> 09:44.292
<i>That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind.</i>

09:44.792 --> 09:46.502
<i>But over time,</i>

09:46.586 --> 09:50.464
<i>we started to realize
that you can accomplish a lot more</i>

09:50.590 --> 09:52.425
<i>if you're actually working together.</i>

09:53.134 --> 09:55.678
- Glad to see you!
- Glad to see you.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.431
<i>We can follow
our dreams to distant stars,</i>

09:58.514 --> 10:02.602
<i>living and working in space
for peaceful economic and scientific gain.</i>

10:02.893 --> 10:05.438
We want our friends to help us
meet these challenges

10:05.605 --> 10:07.231
and share in their benefits.

10:07.356 --> 10:11.569
<i>The International Space Station
is one of the few examples</i>

10:11.652 --> 10:15.072
<i>of true international collaboration
that still exists.</i>

10:15.698 --> 10:18.075
<i>We are bringing
our nations closer together.</i>

10:18.826 --> 10:20.661
<i>Together, we will lead our world.</i>

10:27.335 --> 10:29.545
We're in
the Russian Service Module, welcome.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.215
And you're in the very back end
of the space station.

10:33.591 --> 10:36.594
The doors you came through, uh,
are the sleeping quarters.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.220
There's two sleeping quarters here.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.931
What's really nice
about the Russian sleeping quarters,

10:41.015 --> 10:44.352
they both have a window,
which is really, really cool.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.730
So this is the Russian...
uh, the Russian toilet.

10:47.938 --> 10:50.232
There's a little... little lid here.

10:50.524 --> 10:54.403
Your business goes in... in the insert,
and then it gets full,

10:54.862 --> 10:56.405
and you have to change out the container.

10:56.489 --> 10:57.740
Oh, yeah, it smells.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.285
Space doesn't make that go away.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.538
One cool thing is, if you can...

11:04.747 --> 11:06.916
On the real space station,
if you bend down like this,

11:06.999 --> 11:09.210
you can look through all of the hatches,

11:09.835 --> 11:14.048
<i>and see to the very forward part
of the... of the space station,</i>

11:14.131 --> 11:15.966
<i>and it's pretty neat to do.</i>

11:16.759 --> 11:19.011
<i>So there's really two things
that we have to train</i>

11:19.095 --> 11:22.556
<i>while we're here in Star City,
the Russian portion of the space station,</i>

11:22.640 --> 11:26.977
<i>and our launch and return to...
to Earth in the Soyuz spacecraft.</i>

11:27.311 --> 11:28.938
So this is a very intense period,

11:29.021 --> 11:30.481
where we're making sure
that we've completed

11:30.564 --> 11:33.609
all of the preparation
to get approved for flight.

11:35.653 --> 11:38.072
<i>I'm here to train
with my two Russian crewmates,</i>

11:38.280 --> 11:40.408
<i>Nikolai Tikhonov and Andrei Babkin.</i>

11:41.117 --> 11:44.495
<i>They've been cosmonauts for years,
but this will be their first launch.</i>

11:47.039 --> 11:51.377
<i>Thirteen years I'm on training,
and our flight's canceled</i>

11:51.669 --> 11:55.381
two times already so,
I'm tired to wait.

12:09.937 --> 12:11.480
<i>In the Soyuz simulation,</i>

12:11.564 --> 12:13.774
<i>we're practicing docking
to the space station.</i>

12:14.567 --> 12:16.986
<i>And Nikolai is the commander
of our Soyuz crew.</i>

12:21.866 --> 12:24.285
<i>Nikolai is,
really technically sharp,</i>

12:24.577 --> 12:28.289
<i>and I like the way
he and Andrei work together,</i>

12:28.414 --> 12:30.708
<i>even though they both haven't been
in space yet.</i>

13:02.698 --> 13:03.699
Very nice.

13:06.827 --> 13:08.621
<i>When you're inside
a three-person crew,</i>

13:09.330 --> 13:11.957
<i>it doesn't matter,
your nationality or your background.</i>

13:12.166 --> 13:13.959
- Close the hatch. Close the hatch.
- And close the hatch? And...

13:14.084 --> 13:17.963
<i>It matters how effective are you
at accomplishing the mission.</i>

13:48.744 --> 13:50.329
<i>Houston, station.
Space to Ground One.</i>

13:50.412 --> 13:51.622
<i>Go ahead, please.</i>

13:51.705 --> 13:54.959
Yeah, we're in the service module,
we've got one indication of smoke.

13:55.876 --> 13:56.919
Right here, this one.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.512
There are things
on the space station that can kill you.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.100
<i>We practice
for that worst case scenario,</i>

14:11.183 --> 14:12.810
<i>so that we're ready for those situations,</i>

14:12.935 --> 14:16.272
and we can react without emotion,
we just run through the procedure,

14:16.397 --> 14:17.898
and know that it's gonna keep us safe.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.991
Houston Station,
Space to Ground One.

14:27.074 --> 14:30.953
The crew, we all three feel good,
all the hatches are closed.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.674
How do you feel? Hot?
- We're alive.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.343
Survived.

14:46.802 --> 14:47.845
Glad to be done.

14:53.684 --> 14:54.685
Morning.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.440
<i>We are simulating a Russian EVA.</i>

15:00.691 --> 15:03.068
<i>Nikolai and Andrei
would be putting the suits on.</i>

15:03.152 --> 15:08.115
<i>If it's only the three of us up there,
it'll be me left inside the space station,</i>

15:08.282 --> 15:11.827
so it's nice to have somebody that knows
what they're doing to let you back in.

15:21.128 --> 15:23.130
<i>Everything's clicking,
everybody knows their role,</i>

15:23.213 --> 15:26.175
<i>everybody just does their job
without even really saying anything.</i>

15:41.482 --> 15:43.275
<i>Every time someone closes a hatch,</i>

15:43.859 --> 15:47.988
<i>even if it's a hair, it can be enough
to cause a path for air to get out.</i>

15:53.786 --> 15:58.040
<i>So that's the responsibility.
All of that happens by making sure</i>

15:58.290 --> 16:00.960
<i>that you're working together
hand in hand on a procedure.</i>

16:06.507 --> 16:10.344
<i>We cannot work onboard
the station if we do not trust each of us.</i>

16:10.970 --> 16:14.264
<i>And in this case,
we are really close to each other.</i>

16:15.140 --> 16:16.517
<i>So we are one crew...</i>

16:17.726 --> 16:19.311
maybe like a family.

16:45.212 --> 16:47.256
So that was kind of cool,
watching the...

16:47.381 --> 16:49.008
Oh, they had cameras
in there that you can see?

16:49.091 --> 16:52.344
Yeah, and it's like three different rooms,
they had camera setups.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.139
<i>This is the first time that
I've been here, I find it all fascinating.</i>

16:55.264 --> 16:58.767
<i>There's always something cool to see,
so that was good, that was exciting.</i>

17:53.530 --> 17:59.828
Every human who can
realize their dream feel happy.

18:07.377 --> 18:09.171
Oh, my God.

18:09.505 --> 18:13.634
<i>We say in the astronaut corps,
it's not what you're gonna do in space,</i>

18:13.717 --> 18:15.052
<i>it's who you're gonna do it with.</i>

18:15.511 --> 18:19.306
<i>In fact, I think that's very true
in life, right? And this is no different.</i>

18:19.431 --> 18:21.475
<i>I'm making two new best friends.</i>

18:21.934 --> 18:24.103
Uh, it's just a lovely crew.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.105
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

18:33.654 --> 18:39.118
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

18:56.593 --> 18:58.512
<i>And it looks like the Expedition 61</i>

18:58.595 --> 18:59.680
<i>crew members are beginning to gather.</i>

18:59.972 --> 19:03.308
<i>You've got Christina Koch
and Aleksandr Skvortsov there.</i>

19:04.184 --> 19:05.978
<i>And here comes Luca Parmitano.</i>

19:09.273 --> 19:12.109
<i>Two minutes to scheduled activation.</i>

19:13.026 --> 19:15.821
<i>A few final pictures
and, uh, farewell waves,</i>

19:16.280 --> 19:17.739
<i>then they'll be leaving behind</i>

19:18.115 --> 19:21.326
<i>Andrew Morgan, Jessica Muir,
and Oleg Skripochka.</i>

19:23.287 --> 19:26.957
<i>Thirty seconds to activation.</i>

19:27.082 --> 19:29.543
<i>We're coming up on
what we call crew rotation.</i>

19:30.252 --> 19:31.461
<i>Luca will come back.</i>

19:32.087 --> 19:34.423
<i>Drew Morgan, Jessica Muir,
they'll still be onboard,</i>

19:34.923 --> 19:37.384
<i>and then in just a little while,
Chris will launch</i>

19:37.718 --> 19:40.095
and will put station back up
to six people.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.264
<i>We have separation.</i>

19:43.182 --> 19:44.600
<i>Beautiful.</i>

19:49.438 --> 19:53.317
<i>And that is a great view
of the Soyuz, under the main parachute.</i>

19:54.026 --> 19:55.360
Step back, step back a little.

19:55.569 --> 20:00.282
<i>And it looks like
Soyuz MS-13 has touched down.</i>

20:01.325 --> 20:04.077
<i>Luca will be traveling back to Europe.</i>

20:06.955 --> 20:09.416
<i>The Expedition 61 crew is officially home.</i>

20:13.503 --> 20:16.006
<i>For my training, I've flown
to the European Astronaut Center</i>

20:16.298 --> 20:17.591
<i>near Cologne, Germany.</i>

20:20.385 --> 20:21.720
<i>So, dude, good to see you, man.</i>

20:22.054 --> 20:23.889
<i>I couldn't
wait to see you.</i>

20:24.306 --> 20:26.433
On the space station, you'll be busy.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.769
You'll be surprised
by how much busier it is.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.938
- It is now, six years later. Yeah.
Yeah.

20:31.563 --> 20:32.689
We go through here, where...

20:32.814 --> 20:34.942
We're going to the crew room,
so whichever you want.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.068
Sure, let's go...

20:36.360 --> 20:39.446
<i>There's a uniqueness
about talking with somebody</i>

20:39.529 --> 20:42.616
<i>that just landed before you go.</i>

20:43.867 --> 20:44.868
Coffee?

20:44.952 --> 20:47.037
Go ahead, I'll make myself a little blend.

20:47.162 --> 20:50.499
- You got your thing going on?
- Yeah, I got my... I'm Italian, you know?

20:50.582 --> 20:52.209
- Yeah.
Coffee is my religion.

20:52.876 --> 20:54.711
<i>It's such an amazing experience,
the whole thing.</i>

20:54.962 --> 20:59.883
It was one of the busiest,
more ambitious expeditions ever.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.011
<i>And having a chance
at fixing the AMS</i>

21:03.178 --> 21:06.056
<i>was just literally out of this world.</i>

21:06.974 --> 21:09.476
The first AAF is right in front of me.

21:09.726 --> 21:11.812
You know,
I didn't want to create any force

21:12.354 --> 21:16.316
where I would be pushing the cap,
the leak indicator.

21:16.817 --> 21:19.528
So, I was trying to be delicate,
and I'm like, it's not opening.

21:20.070 --> 21:23.198
Just need to put a little more effort,
little more effort, little more effort,

21:23.323 --> 21:24.658
and then, bang.

21:25.617 --> 21:29.871
Instantaneously both,
VLI popped up and the indicator all red...

21:29.955 --> 21:31.581
- Yeah, it's full red.
-...fully red, full red.

21:31.665 --> 21:35.294
Instantaneous. I was... I was miserable...

21:35.460 --> 21:38.714
for that time, I was really miserable
and I do this command,

21:38.797 --> 21:41.383
and this is the happy moment of days.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.011
When I open the VLI
and I didn't see motion,

21:44.845 --> 21:47.973
and I think the joy comes out of my voice,
it was like, "There's no red."

21:48.098 --> 21:49.433
Yeah.
-"There's no leak."

21:49.850 --> 21:51.059
- Oh, my God.
- So at that point, yeah...

21:51.184 --> 21:52.728
- That was so awesome.
- Oh, it was.

21:52.936 --> 21:56.189
It was such a liberating moment,
such a relief.

21:56.898 --> 22:02.487
<i>Now that AMS is complete,
we expect AMS to give tremendous science.</i>

22:02.821 --> 22:07.117
<i>We felt that we gave our contribution
to something that's going to matter.</i>

22:07.659 --> 22:09.119
Drew and I studied your videos,

22:09.286 --> 22:11.079
you know, we would go through things
and, like, you know,

22:11.204 --> 22:13.832
Chris did it this way,
he actually mentioned this,

22:13.915 --> 22:17.961
and, uh, maybe we can incorporate that.

22:18.086 --> 22:21.214
<i>I feel so grateful for everything
that we learned from Chris.</i>

22:21.548 --> 22:23.258
I don't have anything that I could hold on

22:23.425 --> 22:24.468
- to go back.
- To roll back.

22:24.801 --> 22:28.722
So I give myself a swing,
and I swing myself out of the APFR.

22:32.059 --> 22:34.061
<i>No, he was with us,
he was with us the whole time.</i>

22:34.436 --> 22:36.355
Oh, my God, that's so funny.

22:36.480 --> 22:38.523
All right, dude.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.233
- It was awesome talking to you, brother.
- I'll see...

22:40.317 --> 22:42.235
- see you tonight. Yeah.
- Yeah, see you tonight.

22:42.736 --> 22:45.947
<i>The next thing is going to be Chris
arriving on the space station.</i>

22:47.407 --> 22:48.617
<i>It feels right.</i>

22:49.034 --> 22:52.454
You could send Chris up,
and if things went south,

22:52.662 --> 22:56.249
and he was on his own
for a very long time without anybody else,

22:56.750 --> 22:59.169
<i>he could manage
the space station by himself,</i>

22:59.294 --> 23:02.047
<i>and probably against
an alien invasion too.</i>

23:35.622 --> 23:41.002
I just got some unbelievably sad news.

23:41.294 --> 23:47.092
Uh, my crewmate and friend
and Soyuz commander, Nikolai...

23:48.510 --> 23:52.180
<i>...something happened,
a severe injury to his eye.</i>

23:53.640 --> 23:57.227
He did say that his vision is

23:58.103 --> 24:01.857
sort of like looking through
a murky plastic bag,

24:02.732 --> 24:06.027
<i>and it's not gonna
be healed up in time, so...</i>

24:06.820 --> 24:10.449
I think that they're gonna take
both Andrei and Nikolai

24:11.408 --> 24:16.329
out of the crew, and bring forward
who was our backup crew...

24:17.330 --> 24:19.166
<i>and I'll fly with them.</i>

24:20.041 --> 24:21.084
<i>It's just tragic.</i>

24:23.503 --> 24:29.634
<i>Honestly, I was really disappointed,
and I was maybe angry.</i>

24:32.137 --> 24:36.183
<i>Right now, I just trying to see
on the situation, as a philosopher.</i>

24:44.941 --> 24:46.318
How are you?
Good, good, good.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.444
<i>Let's sit down.</i>

24:48.028 --> 24:52.199
We spent so many times together,
and made a nice friendship

24:52.741 --> 24:57.370
- and nice team the three of us.
- It's really, really disappointing.

24:57.537 --> 24:58.872
Yeah.
- But...

24:58.955 --> 25:00.123
I was really looking forward

25:00.207 --> 25:02.584
to spending those six months
with you and Andrei, but...

25:02.667 --> 25:04.920
- Yeah, yeah, so...
- Maybe next flight.

25:06.463 --> 25:08.924
- Okay, good luck, have a safe trip!
- Thank you.

25:16.097 --> 25:20.769
<i>Nikolai didn't determine
that his flight preparation would end.</i>

25:20.852 --> 25:24.397
It was determined for him,
and that's tough to handle.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.197
<i>He's such an amazing person,
he has a great outlook on stuff,</i>

25:32.364 --> 25:34.658
<i>but you know deep inside
it's gotta hurt.</i>

25:35.992 --> 25:38.203
It hurts me as his friend.

25:41.039 --> 25:44.292
<i>The mission will adapt,
but on a personal level,</i>

25:44.668 --> 25:45.877
<i>I'm just disappointed.</i>

25:56.805 --> 25:57.889
Okay, come here.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.768
<i>We've just got
a couple of simulations this week</i>

26:43.935 --> 26:46.438
<i>that will brush the rust off
on how we work together,</i>

26:47.063 --> 26:49.608
<i>and kind of work out our patterns
on how they like things,</i>

26:50.609 --> 26:51.651
<i>and we'll go from there.</i>

26:58.700 --> 26:59.993
<i>We need you to understand,</i>

27:00.118 --> 27:01.494
<i>you could be spreading it to someone else,</i>

27:01.745 --> 27:03.747
<i>or you could be getting it
from someone else.</i>

27:03.913 --> 27:05.707
<i>Stay. At. Home.</i>

27:06.458 --> 27:09.794
<i>We're very worried
about every city in the United States,</i>

27:09.919 --> 27:12.297
<i>and the potential for this virus
to get out of control,</i>

27:12.380 --> 27:13.965
<i>and we really believe...</i>

27:14.049 --> 27:17.385
<i>Like everyone else in the world,
we are dealing with COVID-19.</i>

27:17.594 --> 27:20.555
<i>Pretty much everybody
at this point is working remotely.</i>

27:20.680 --> 27:23.767
<i>I'm actually pretty excited
to be going in.</i>

27:24.267 --> 27:27.520
This is a little bit of normalcy for me.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.149
<i>Right now, we're in stage three,</i>

27:31.483 --> 27:33.777
<i>so three out of four,
and that essentially means</i>

27:33.943 --> 27:37.113
<i>the only people who are even
going on-site right now,</i>

27:37.322 --> 27:39.991
<i>you have to have what's called
a mission-essential task.</i>

27:40.950 --> 27:45.538
<i>We're coming up on JSC now,
the visitor center right now is closed.</i>

27:45.789 --> 27:49.668
I mean, they're doing tours
and things like that all the time,

27:49.751 --> 27:53.588
and that's a giant parking lot
that's completely empty right now.

28:06.893 --> 28:09.396
<i>It's been difficult,
like it has for everybody,</i>

28:09.521 --> 28:11.064
<i>just to navigate through.</i>

28:11.648 --> 28:14.818
<i>You still have a job to do,
you still have a mission.</i>

28:14.984 --> 28:17.070
<i>These things can't just come to a halt.</i>

28:17.821 --> 28:20.532
<i>We know we still have to keep
sending people into space</i>

28:20.615 --> 28:23.076
so we can keep the space station running,
keep it up there.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.787
<i>Statuses have been changing</i>

28:25.912 --> 28:30.083
<i>every single day with travel,
with quarantine.</i>

28:31.543 --> 28:33.962
<i>I know they're gonna do
whatever they can for the families,</i>

28:34.129 --> 28:37.215
<i>but you put the mission
before anything else.</i>

28:48.643 --> 28:50.937
See, I'm gonna start crying,
cause this is gonna be hard.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.944
Um, when I came here,
I knew exactly what day I was gonna say,

28:58.027 --> 28:59.112
you know, goodbye to Chris.

29:00.321 --> 29:02.449
And so now,
with everything that's going on,

29:02.532 --> 29:05.493
with borders closing,
you know, reduced flights and everything,

29:05.618 --> 29:09.038
we had to make a decision
on what was the best plan.

29:09.956 --> 29:12.709
<i>So that kind of sealed it,
that it was just time to go home.</i>

29:13.543 --> 29:17.255
And so now,
I'm leaving tomorrow morning, early,

29:17.756 --> 29:23.136
and with that just comes,
you know, a whole rush of emotion, um...

29:24.304 --> 29:29.350
It's just the idea of not physically
being able to stand in front of him

29:29.476 --> 29:33.772
and let him know that we all love him,
and we care about what he's doing.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.815
<i>What time are we live?</i>

29:35.899 --> 29:37.650
<i>-At... Or going... Two?
Two.</i>

29:38.485 --> 29:41.029
<i>Like anyone, when your husband
and your best friend</i>

29:41.112 --> 29:43.198
<i>is, you know, leaving you
for like seven months,</i>

29:43.281 --> 29:45.366
<i>it's a little rough to deal with.</i>

29:47.035 --> 29:48.536
Lot of people do it all the time.

29:49.746 --> 29:53.458
So, I'm no different than anyone else,
it's just real to me right now.

29:54.834 --> 29:56.836
So I'll hear it
through the TV speakers?

29:56.961 --> 29:59.172
You will, yeah.
You will sit on top of this.

30:03.051 --> 30:05.386
<i>I honestly believe
it's just as emotional</i>

30:05.470 --> 30:06.721
<i>for Chris as it is for me.</i>

30:06.971 --> 30:10.225
<i>Of course, he'll be trying
to do whatever he can</i>

30:10.308 --> 30:11.476
<i>to make me feel better.</i>

30:12.560 --> 30:16.022
All right,
everyone standby, please. Three, two, one.

30:16.731 --> 30:19.108
<i>Hey, there, it's Bill Harwood over
at the Kennedy Space Center.</i>

30:19.192 --> 30:20.944
<i>-Chris, how you doing?</i>
- Bill. Bill,

30:21.069 --> 30:22.612
good morning great to talk to you.

30:23.112 --> 30:24.948
<i>You know, it's weird,
I usually ask questions</i>

30:25.073 --> 30:26.950
<i>that are totally focused on
the mission but, you know,</i>

30:27.033 --> 30:30.745
<i>you know every conversation
these days starts with coronavirus,</i>

30:30.829 --> 30:34.415
<i>so are there any restrictions
at Baikonur on your family on travel?</i>

30:34.624 --> 30:36.501
<i>I mean, if they want to come, can they?</i>

30:36.668 --> 30:39.754
We do know that answer,
and I will have no launch guests

30:39.879 --> 30:43.341
in... at... at the Baikonur Cosmodrome.

30:43.508 --> 30:46.719
It really is gonna be strange,
the things that are stressing

30:46.970 --> 30:48.930
the rest of the world,
and the rest of America

30:49.180 --> 30:51.808
are the same things
that are stressing me right now.

30:54.227 --> 30:57.981
<i>I think anybody out there
hates to see somebody</i>

30:58.147 --> 31:00.024
<i>that you care about hurting.</i>

31:00.650 --> 31:03.278
- All right, we're all clear.
All the best, stay safe.

31:03.361 --> 31:06.447
<i>Your heart goes more to the other person
than yourself, in a way.</i>

31:11.828 --> 31:13.496
<i>We had to make a tough decision</i>

31:13.580 --> 31:17.709
<i>that if she didn't leave soon,
she might not be able to get back.</i>

31:20.378 --> 31:21.421
<i>So off she went.</i>

31:27.218 --> 31:30.889
<i>It was not smiley,
"Okay, see you soon," you know?</i>

31:31.014 --> 31:33.933
<i>We both knew that
that was a real goodbye...</i>

31:35.059 --> 31:36.060
so it was tough.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.279
<i>About four and a half to five hours.</i>

31:46.988 --> 31:48.323
We'll warm that in here.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.702
You wanna be on camera?

31:55.330 --> 31:59.292
<i>We just found out that we won't
be able to attend the launch,</i>

31:59.500 --> 32:01.794
<i>um, because of COVID restrictions.</i>

32:02.921 --> 32:05.757
<i>We're so disappointed,
we were so looking forward to it,</i>

32:06.049 --> 32:09.802
and I know it's very upsetting
for Chris too,

32:10.136 --> 32:13.598
um, not to be able to have
his family there, and his friends.

32:15.183 --> 32:19.687
We were lucky that we had
been able to go back in 2013.

32:20.605 --> 32:25.360
<i>When that rocket goes up and you see
the blast of fire underneath them,</i>

32:25.443 --> 32:28.404
<i>and you think, "Oh, my God,
my son is in that."</i>

32:28.696 --> 32:32.533
It's like...
...unbelievable experience.

32:32.700 --> 32:38.665
So to miss that is gonna
be really, really difficult.

32:40.166 --> 32:42.627
<i>But Chris is good at compartmentalizing.</i>

32:43.252 --> 32:47.799
<i>He's always managed to deal
with the situation at hand.</i>

32:48.216 --> 32:50.885
<i>You know, yes, you've got
a crisis going on,</i>

32:50.969 --> 32:52.887
<i>but this is what I have to do.</i>

33:01.896 --> 33:04.232
<i>Today we leave Star City
for the launch site</i>

33:04.315 --> 33:05.566
<i>in Baikonur, Kazakhstan.</i>

33:09.737 --> 33:12.365
These are my personal items
to fly in space.

33:14.075 --> 33:18.579
This guy right here, he was with me
on every mission in Afghanistan,

33:18.663 --> 33:23.584
and my first shuttle mission,
and my second space mission, so...

33:24.585 --> 33:27.088
I've lived through all those things,
so he's definitely coming.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.048
Lucky charm.

33:32.468 --> 33:35.013
<i>Human space flight is prone
to constant changes.</i>

33:35.513 --> 33:37.515
<i>For somebody like Chris, it's added stress</i>

33:38.057 --> 33:41.769
<i>because one of the most stressful things
astronauts will talk about</i>

33:41.853 --> 33:43.938
<i>is not what happens onboard
the space station,</i>

33:44.355 --> 33:46.399
it's what happens down
on the ground while they're up there.

33:55.158 --> 33:58.870
<i>When you think
about the six-month separation</i>

33:58.995 --> 34:02.248
<i>in the context of what's going on
with a worldwide pandemic,</i>

34:02.832 --> 34:05.418
<i>it does put a twist on things.</i>

34:06.961 --> 34:12.008
<i>I had these crazy thoughts like, "Wow,
what if the economic impact is so deep</i>

34:12.884 --> 34:17.180
<i>that it somehow impacts the ability
for the next vehicle to come?"</i>

34:17.847 --> 34:19.849
<i>It sounds like a crazy thought, right?</i>

34:19.932 --> 34:23.728
<i>But, I mean, nobody knows
what six months is gonna be.</i>

34:23.978 --> 34:26.898
<i>I'll go up there, I'm gonna do
my daily job on the space station,</i>

34:26.981 --> 34:28.816
<i>but my other daily job
on the space station</i>

34:28.900 --> 34:32.945
<i>will be to keep an eye and an ear
on what's happening on Earth.</i>

34:40.078 --> 34:43.247
<i>It's one in the morning
on launch morning.</i>

34:43.748 --> 34:44.749
<i>Can't sleep.</i>

34:45.208 --> 34:49.170
I'm supposed to get up at 3:30,
so in about a couple hours.

34:49.504 --> 34:53.883
I do admit that I'm going over in my head
a million things like the work part of it,

34:54.008 --> 34:56.552
the... all the procedures on launch.

34:57.512 --> 34:59.180
I just would rather be sleeping.

35:08.981 --> 35:10.191
<i>Launch morning.</i>

35:11.692 --> 35:13.319
Everything's pretty much packed.

35:13.986 --> 35:15.404
That bag's for the bus.

35:16.697 --> 35:20.284
We put on this long underwear.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.329
It goes underneath our flight suit.

35:25.081 --> 35:26.415
Next event is breakfast,

35:26.958 --> 35:31.712
and then a little short farewell ceremony,
and then off we go.

35:38.636 --> 35:39.762
<i>Is it recording?</i>

35:40.930 --> 35:44.517
Yeah. Mom, say hi to Chris.
- Hi, Chris.

35:46.227 --> 35:48.855
- Hi, Chris, oh, my gosh.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.606
Now, when's take-off time?

35:51.399 --> 35:53.442
4:00 a.m. this morning.
Yeah.

35:53.526 --> 35:56.237
You're gonna stay up for it?
- Of course, I am.

35:56.320 --> 36:00.032
Oh.
- I'm not staying up. I'm getting up.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.492
Oh.

36:02.201 --> 36:05.204
<i>-Yeah, I'll do the dishes.
Good.</i>

36:10.626 --> 36:12.295
<i>Good morning,
good afternoon, good evening,</i>

36:12.378 --> 36:14.547
<i>anywhere you're tuning in
from all over the world,</i>

36:14.714 --> 36:16.841
<i>I'm NASA's Dan Huot, coming to you live</i>

36:17.008 --> 36:19.552
<i>from NASA's Johnson
Space Center here in Houston.</i>

36:20.052 --> 36:22.847
We're gonna be taking you through
the countdown of the launch today,

36:23.181 --> 36:26.517
<i>the ride uphill and the journey
to the International Space Station.</i>

36:28.019 --> 36:30.104
<i>Veteran NASA astronaut Chris Cassidy,</i>

36:30.188 --> 36:33.399
<i>going to be making his third trip
to the International Space Station,</i>

36:33.482 --> 36:36.277
<i>serving as the commander of Expedition 63.</i>

36:37.320 --> 36:39.280
<i>Cassidy is going back to space.</i>

36:42.116 --> 36:46.704
<i>This is gonna be the first crew launch
on the new Soyuz-2.1a booster,</i>

36:46.954 --> 36:50.458
<i>and they are set to blast off
at 3:05 a.m. central time,</i>

36:50.541 --> 36:53.961
<i>4:05 a.m. Eastern Time here in the US.</i>

36:54.378 --> 36:55.379
<i>This is going to be the first...</i>

36:55.504 --> 36:57.632
I just got a picture
from the doctors of Chris.

36:58.049 --> 37:02.428
He's suited up and... ready to go.

37:03.888 --> 37:08.100
<i>He's doing good, we had, you know,
a little bit of an emotional moment.</i>

37:08.267 --> 37:11.062
Right now
I'm getting ready to head onsite

37:11.187 --> 37:15.566
<i>at JSC to, um, go to Mission Control
and watch the launch there.</i>

37:16.943 --> 37:18.819
<i>The crew is ready to walk out.</i>

37:19.695 --> 37:23.407
<i>Today's launch is pretty notable
for several reasons.</i>

37:23.574 --> 37:26.661
<i>The first, uh, being that this crew
underwent their final weeks</i>

37:26.744 --> 37:30.498
<i>of space flight preparations
during the current COVID-19 pandemic.</i>

37:31.123 --> 37:33.251
<i>So things will look
a little bit different this time</i>

37:33.376 --> 37:35.544
<i>compared to typical
Soyuz launch preparations,</i>

37:35.628 --> 37:37.880
<i>mainly just like a lot of other things.</i>

37:40.049 --> 37:41.425
How are you feeling, Ms. Cassidy?

37:43.803 --> 37:45.638
Pretty excited.

37:46.889 --> 37:50.559
<i>Here's a view of Chris Cassidy,
and he's in the right seat today.</i>

37:50.643 --> 37:53.688
This is gonna be his third trip
into outer space.

37:54.522 --> 37:55.940
<i>All right,
getting the gloves on.</i>

37:56.023 --> 37:57.358
Look,
he's got his wedding ring on.

37:57.483 --> 38:01.028
Saw that.
<i>We are inside two minutes to launch.</i>

38:01.112 --> 38:04.115
<i>Normal activation.</i>

38:04.407 --> 38:07.743
<i>Aviation reporting everything normal
onboard the spacecraft.</i>

38:11.080 --> 38:13.124
<i>And we see
that first Umbilical Tower separating,</i>

38:13.207 --> 38:15.584
<i>that means we're
35 seconds away from launch.</i>

38:15.668 --> 38:17.670
Oh, God, here's where I just get
so nervous.

38:19.338 --> 38:22.675
<i>There goes the second tower,
so we are 15 seconds away from launch.</i>

38:24.468 --> 38:27.763
<i>Oh, my gosh, my insides are shaking.</i>

38:27.888 --> 38:28.931
<i>It's unreal.</i>

38:30.599 --> 38:32.977
<i>We're gonna see the boosters
at the bottom light up.</i>

38:36.480 --> 38:38.274
I know, oh, God.

38:41.485 --> 38:44.947
<i>ETA, five, four, three, two, one.</i>

38:49.160 --> 38:50.161
<i>And liftoff.</i>

38:56.042 --> 38:57.918
<i>Oh, my God, there he goes!</i>

38:59.378 --> 39:01.589
Go, go.

39:02.506 --> 39:03.924
Oh, man.

39:07.803 --> 39:11.057
<i>Boosters are working
nominally, the crew is feeling fine.</i>

39:11.932 --> 39:13.726
<i>Cassidy, Ivanishin, and Vagner</i>

39:13.893 --> 39:16.395
on their way
to the International Space Station.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.111
<i>Oh, my God, wow.</i>

39:25.654 --> 39:29.658
<i>Given all of the difficulties
with a worldwide pandemic,</i>

39:29.909 --> 39:32.995
<i>while that made the challenge
all the more daunting,</i>

39:33.412 --> 39:36.624
<i>that makes the success
all the more sweet.</i>

39:40.211 --> 39:42.630
<i>The crew is feeling fine,
40 seconds enter.</i>

39:45.591 --> 39:48.552
<i>Five hundred
and ten seconds into flight.</i>

39:50.262 --> 39:55.184
<i>Your pitch and yaw are all nominal.
Get ready for the stage separation.</i>

39:56.185 --> 39:59.313
<i>So we'll see the engines cut off,
and once the vehicle separates,</i>

39:59.480 --> 40:01.273
<i>it usually gives the crew
a bit of a jolt.</i>

40:10.074 --> 40:13.035
<i>And congratulations, guys.
You are in orbit.</i>

40:13.911 --> 40:15.996
<i>Third stage separation confirmed.</i>

40:16.414 --> 40:17.748
<i>Godspeed Chris Cassidy.</i>

40:18.040 --> 40:19.834
Yes.

40:30.136 --> 40:31.554
<i>The moment I can't wait for...</i>

40:33.431 --> 40:36.559
<i>is right when the rocket engines cut off.</i>

40:40.271 --> 40:44.066
<i>You enter this zone of no communication,
and it's just really peaceful.</i>

40:46.902 --> 40:49.280
<i>That part is what I'm really,
really looking forward to.</i>

40:54.160 --> 40:57.746
<i>We can clearly see
the target and crosshairs are aligned.</i>

40:59.165 --> 41:02.334
<i>Eight minutes approximately,
range is great,</i>

41:03.085 --> 41:04.587
<i>standing by for contact.</i>

41:07.631 --> 41:13.137
<i>Contact confirmed,
hooks engaged at 17, 13, 21.</i>

41:26.484 --> 41:28.819
We were missing you!
Hello, hello!

41:28.903 --> 41:31.864
Great to be here! Hey.
Hey.

41:31.947 --> 41:33.782
Feel... Does it feel familiar?
- Yeah.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.785
<i>You know, being back in...
in space,</i>

41:37.244 --> 41:38.871
<i>it feels like you never left,</i>

41:39.580 --> 41:41.624
<i>but it never stops being exciting.</i>

41:41.749 --> 41:44.460
- You guys have been busy, man!
Oh, man, we've been busy.

41:45.961 --> 41:48.589
<i>I just feel truly honored</i>

41:49.048 --> 41:51.509
<i>that of all the people
that could be here in space</i>

41:52.134 --> 41:54.428
<i>floating around, looking at the planet,</i>

41:55.054 --> 41:56.347
<i>I get to be one of them.</i>
