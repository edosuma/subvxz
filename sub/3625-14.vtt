I love you, Nate Archibald.

Always have, always will.
I love you, too.

00:10.401 --> 00:14.492
What is wrong with you?
This is not who you are.Look, I know who Blair
and those girls are,

00:14.536 --> 00:17.017
but I know who I am,
and I'm not gonna forget that

00:17.060 --> 00:19.889
just 'cause
I hang out with them.We're not supposed
to talk, remember?

00:19.932 --> 00:23.066
I can't help myself. I never
should have let you let me go.

00:23.110 --> 00:26.939
I will not base my personal life
on your preferences.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.116
Dan is my boyfriend.

00:29.159 --> 00:31.857
I would rather be
Chuck's stepsister than Dan's.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.599
Lily, would you do me
the honor of being my wife?

00:34.643 --> 00:37.689
He proposed before we left,
and I'm going to say yes.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.082
Take care, Rufus.

00:39.126 --> 00:42.825
How glad are you to see
our families merge, sis?

00:42.868 --> 00:45.088
So glad that if you
ever call me that again

00:45.132 --> 00:47.525
it'll be the last thing
you ever say, Chuck.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.788
Unless you want
dear Nathaniel to know

00:49.832 --> 00:51.268
how you lost
your virginity to me

00:51.312 --> 00:52.617
'in the back
of a moving vehicle'

00:52.661 --> 00:54.445
I encourage
patience and restraint.

00:54.489 --> 00:56.578
Isn't there someone else
you can torture?

00:56.621 --> 00:57.622
[Nate]
Look, I know
you're friends with Blair

00:57.666 --> 00:58.928
but if you know something..

00:58.971 --> 01:00.669
Well, Blair is never
really my friend.

01:00.712 --> 01:03.672
- So?
- So...yeah.

01:03.715 --> 01:04.934
There's something
you should know.

01:04.977 --> 01:06.457
- What a bitch.
- Oh, my God.

01:06.501 --> 01:08.155
[thinking]
She is such a slut!

01:08.198 --> 01:10.331
I made a decision
I was in no condition to make.

01:10.374 --> 01:12.681
I want nothing else to do
with you, Blair. It's over.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.726
You held
a certain fascination

01:14.770 --> 01:17.425
when you were beautiful
and untouched.

01:17.468 --> 01:19.122
I don't want you anymore.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.819
And I can't see
why anyone else would.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.952
- What are you doing here?
- I was just leaving.

01:22.995 --> 01:27.348
No. Stay. Consider yourself
dethroned, Queen B.

01:27.391 --> 01:30.438
Jenny, if you walk away
from me now, I will ruin you.

01:30.481 --> 01:32.614
How are you gonna do that?

01:32.657 --> 01:34.050
My whole life
is falling apart.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.486
Stay and fight.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.140
We'll get through this together.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.794
You promise?

01:38.837 --> 01:40.012
Promise.

01:44.539 --> 01:45.801
[Gossip Girl]
Why isn't she answering?

01:45.844 --> 01:47.455
And who am I?

01:47.498 --> 01:50.893
That's one secret
I'll never tell.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.547
You know you love me.

01:52.590 --> 01:55.332

Cat!

02:35.198 --> 02:37.069
You don't have a cat, Jenny.

02:40.247 --> 02:42.640
My name is Blair.

02:42.684 --> 02:44.599
You don't have anyone.

02:47.254 --> 02:48.733

Were you sunning in Capri
or sinning in Croatia?

03:05.141 --> 03:06.795
Give me the deets.

03:06.838 --> 03:08.362

04:06.637 --> 04:08.683
I can't believe
you lit up in my bathroom.

04:08.726 --> 04:10.554
Well, if I lit up in mine,
then the folks

04:10.598 --> 04:12.469
would know it was me, sis.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.210
Oh, okay, let's get
one thing straight.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.343
Our parents may be insisting
on blending our households

04:16.386 --> 04:17.779
but I am not your sister.

04:17.822 --> 04:19.737
I do not share any of your DNA

04:19.781 --> 04:22.436
nor do I ever wish to.

Then I suggest
you get new hand towels.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.398
Okay.

04:28.442 --> 04:30.966
It's imperative that I bathe.

The bracelet
you lent me in Aspen.

04:55.382 --> 04:57.993
Oh, yeah, you know,
you could've just kept it

04:58.036 --> 04:59.647

I had it.

dress I buy today to go with it.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.406

Oh, I've got some dresses
on hold at Bendel's.

05:21.886 --> 05:23.975
There is an ATM, Jenny.
You said you wanted to hit it.

for me this morning.

are very attentive.

No. No, no.
He should not meet Brigitta.

05:50.698 --> 05:52.656
He's 14. Avoid this person.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.049
May I remind you, Serena, that

05:54.092 --> 05:55.485

a sense of humor?

No.

- Morning, father.
- Hey.

is Lily Van Bulow today?

06:01.752 --> 06:03.188
Oh, I have a headache.

06:03.232 --> 06:05.190
I had a very
frustrating conversation

06:05.234 --> 06:06.714
with the wedding planner
this morning.

06:06.757 --> 06:09.194
Well, may I say
aggravation becomes you?

06:09.238 --> 06:11.936
You may,
but I won't believe it.

06:11.980 --> 06:15.810
So...first day back
at school, huh?

06:15.853 --> 06:18.290
Honey, you didn't,
uh, want to shower?

I have to go meet Blair.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.993

to keep things smooth

She slept at Hazel's last night.

07:06.338 --> 07:08.297
Oh. Who's, uh, who's Hazel?

07:08.340 --> 07:11.953
Her new friend. The girl whose
family she went with to Aspen.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.476
Yeah, I was actually surprised
you let her go

07:13.520 --> 07:14.869
and cancel on mom like that.

07:14.912 --> 07:16.653
Well, your mom
was in complete support of it.

07:16.697 --> 07:17.915
Jenny was very well
taken care of.

uh, private plane.

early birthday present

we ever could have given her.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.488
Oh, so you paid for it?

07:25.532 --> 07:28.143
Well, I gave her pocket money.

07:28.186 --> 07:30.798

One, I can't seem
to nail Jenny down

07:37.892 --> 07:40.155
on what she wants to do
for her actual birthday.

07:40.198 --> 07:41.461
- I'll get it out of her.
- Good.

07:41.504 --> 07:43.941
And, uh, two..

07:43.985 --> 07:46.944
...what the hell
are you still doing here?

07:46.988 --> 07:48.511
Thank you.

from your nightmare.

with Dan tonight.

this whole thing

08:31.162 --> 08:33.077
could have
blown over by now?

Hey, Jenny. Can I talk
to you just for a second?

09:49.545 --> 09:52.374
Um, I'll meet up
with you guys, okay?

09:52.417 --> 09:54.637
Hey, so I may have told Blair

09:54.681 --> 09:56.726
you told me the truth
about her and Chuck.

09:56.770 --> 10:00.121
And I'm sure
she didn't react well to that.

10:00.164 --> 10:02.036
But you don't know
what you're dealing with here.

10:02.079 --> 10:03.298

of Blair, Nate.

gonna happen to you?

20:37.932 --> 20:42.415
I got three cases of champagne
for Serena van der Woodsen.

20:42.458 --> 20:45.069
Oh, no, no.
I'm Serena van der Woodsen.

20:45.113 --> 20:46.462
- But those aren't mine.
- Well.

20:46.506 --> 20:49.857
The purchase order
never lies. Salud!

21:08.441 --> 21:10.965
Hey. Guys, I just got
this incredible Dolce.

21:11.008 --> 21:12.575
- You wanna see?
- It's unbelievable.

21:12.619 --> 21:15.056
You can't turn your back
in your own house.

21:15.099 --> 21:16.318
What are you guys
talking about?

21:16.362 --> 21:19.234
My mother's Valentino
was stolen.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.279
Oh, my God.

21:20.322 --> 21:21.976
It was made especially for her.

21:22.019 --> 21:23.064
It was the same year
he did, uh..

21:23.107 --> 21:24.761
Jackie O's lace wedding mini.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.763
Well, did someone break in?

21:26.807 --> 21:28.635
No, and the maid swore
to the police

21:28.678 --> 21:31.202
that she didn't take it,
but she'll probably get fired.

21:31.246 --> 21:33.248
Wait. Police for a dress?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.858
It's worthy like, $15,000.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.643
My mother told them
if she returned it

21:36.686 --> 21:38.035
they could work something out.

21:38.079 --> 21:39.646
Like she'll bring it back.

21:39.689 --> 21:42.257
Well, you never know.
I mean, it could turn up.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.955
Right, cause really,
where is she gonna wear it?

21:47.349 --> 21:50.352
I'm really glad,
because when I spoke to her

21:50.396 --> 21:52.485
she mentioned the plans
with the girls falling through.

21:52.528 --> 21:54.269
Nope.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.923
Tell you the truth,
I didn't really believe her.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.185
Why?

21:57.228 --> 21:59.143
I thought she was
just conflicted.

21:59.187 --> 22:02.103
About choosing friends
over family.

22:02.146 --> 22:04.540
Well, you know
that's the biggest struggle

22:04.584 --> 22:05.846
with a girl her age.

22:05.889 --> 22:07.413
Memory doesn't serve.

who you're becoming

22:09.023 --> 22:10.720
with who you used to be.

ragged, Mr. Humphrey.

running herself ragged

one of those worlds.

Well, then that's
what she'll get.

for a moment, please?

22:47.714 --> 22:49.019
I need to trade back, alright.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.673
You can keep the scarf
and the shoes

22:50.717 --> 22:52.283

in exchange for the red one.

gonna be possible.

The Valentino...is
seven times that.

sentimental value.

- And I didn't realize--
- No, I'm sorry.

23:13.522 --> 23:15.698
A couple of hours ago,
this dress was mine, alright?

23:15.742 --> 23:17.308
It doesn't even
have tags on it yet.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.398
Look, it's not my fault

what a Valentino's worth.

23:39.243 --> 23:41.681
Listen I wouldn't be calling you
if I had anyone else to turn to.

But I made a mistake,
and I need to fix it.

23:43.770 --> 23:45.119
And I really need
to borrow some money.

Wait, wait, Jenny,
just slow down.

23:47.077 --> 23:49.602
- I promise. I'll pay you back.

and I need to fix it.

- $8,000.

that kind of money for?

than the bar mitzvah remark?

You think I'm ashamed
of where I come from?

No, dad, what I am ashamed of is

30:20.557 --> 30:23.386
having to bring
a brown-bag lunch to school

30:23.430 --> 30:24.953
and you know,
eat it in the bathroom

30:24.997 --> 30:26.041

those things, Jenny.

not even a choice anymore

Chuck said it came for you this
morning, he thought you might

32:02.529 --> 32:05.271
want to open it out
of the house, just in case.

32:05.314 --> 32:07.403

to me himself?
