WEBVTT

00:01.793 --> 00:02.878
I need you to triage
the rest of the unit

00:02.878 --> 00:03.921
'cause we need the beds.

00:03.921 --> 00:04.922
Please tell the interns to stop

00:04.922 --> 00:06.548
putting broccoli in the fridge.

00:06.548 --> 00:07.674
Hey.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.385
(chuckles)
Hey!

00:10.385 --> 00:12.554
Hey.
Yeah, these came for you.

00:12.554 --> 00:14.014
I don't know if you know,

00:14.014 --> 00:16.099
but you haven't updated
your shipping address yet.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.644
As you can see,
my name is also here.

00:18.644 --> 00:20.812
At first, I thought this was
a "make your own hard cider" kit

00:20.812 --> 00:23.732
that I ordered, but it's just
jog bras and stuff.

00:23.732 --> 00:26.151
You know, if it's easier for you
and more convenient,

00:26.151 --> 00:29.071
I can always just stop by
your place and pick things up.

00:29.071 --> 00:30.197
What would be more convenient

00:30.197 --> 00:32.115
is if you updated
your shipping address,

00:32.115 --> 00:33.742
'cause it's my understanding
that Amazon

00:33.742 --> 00:36.370
will deliver your bras
anywhere you tell them to.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.663
Or you could get
your own Prime membership.

00:39.665 --> 00:41.750
Or you could tell your parents
that we're separated.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.545
I-I will, I will.
It's just been a busy month.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.171
Okay, well, then do you mind
if I text them?

00:46.171 --> 00:47.881
'Cause they text me,
like, all the time.

00:47.881 --> 00:49.007
- (pager buzzes)
- So I just keep liking
every text

00:49.007 --> 00:51.301
- and not giving a real response.
- Mm-hmm.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.637
Oh, sorry.

00:53.637 --> 00:54.972
I'm gonna have to take this,
I got to go.

00:54.972 --> 00:57.849
But, um, we'll get
lunch tomorrow.

00:57.849 --> 01:01.103
We'll go through everything--
Amazon, separate accounts.

01:01.103 --> 01:02.854
It's gonna be a fun way
to figure out

01:02.854 --> 01:04.564
how to tell my parents
our world exploded.

01:04.564 --> 01:07.484
- Brit, this isn't funny.
- It was a joke.

01:11.947 --> 01:15.367
Okay, seriously,
what do you think?

01:16.577 --> 01:18.203
They're really good.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.038
I'm telling you, these are
the best pancakes in Boston.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.165
Yeah, it's like I'm on
a maple-flavored cloud.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.542
Guys, if you really like
the pancakes,

01:23.542 --> 01:24.835
you have to come back
and try the sushi.

01:24.835 --> 01:27.629
<i>Mother-lovin' pancake day! ♪</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:28.880
(whoops)

01:28.880 --> 01:30.340
Okay, loud is not always
better, baby.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.301
Hey, look at your attending man.

01:32.301 --> 01:33.844
Congrats on passing the boards.

01:33.844 --> 01:35.137
That's what I'm talking about!
Pssh!

01:35.137 --> 01:37.431
- Nice, congrats.
- Thank you.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.641
- Grab a seat.
- Oh, I want to, but I can't.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.018
I've got back-to-back
surgeries today.

01:41.018 --> 01:42.603
- Oh.
- I just wanted to do this.

01:44.187 --> 01:46.106
All right, go attend
your heart out.

01:46.106 --> 01:47.232
I will.
See you tonight?

01:47.232 --> 01:48.942
- Yeah.
- Okay. One for the road.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.402
Thank you.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.862
Pancake day!

01:51.862 --> 01:53.238
- (camera clicks)
- Yes.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.784
- What? He's got a cute butt.
- Mm-hmm.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.077
You're taking him out
to celebrate?

01:59.077 --> 02:00.412
Ooh, what are you
gonna get him?

02:00.412 --> 02:02.164
Oh, nothing, we haven't been
dating that long.

02:02.164 --> 02:05.375
Well, Felicia, passing your
boards is a big deal.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.169
- You got to get him something.
- Oh, okay.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.838
Uh, boards.
Bo-Board game.

02:09.838 --> 02:12.257
Candy Land. Operation.

02:12.257 --> 02:14.509
Do you always do
that word-associating thing

02:14.509 --> 02:15.844
- when you get gifts?
- Yeah.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.512
Maybe try something
different this time.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.766
You know, I've been hitting
and quitting for so long,

02:20.766 --> 02:23.393
I kind of forgot
how to have a boyfriend.

02:23.393 --> 02:25.437
I got to get to the salon,

02:25.437 --> 02:28.315
but, um, let me know who I can
Venmo for the fluffy cloud.

02:28.315 --> 02:30.067
I should actually go, too.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.319
- What?
- It's my new boss's first day.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.196
Really?
You can't stay a little longer?

02:34.196 --> 02:35.697
I can't, I'm sorry.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.074
I want to make a good
first impression, you know.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.992
- Why, are you okay?
- Yeah.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.661
- Yeah, no, I'm good.
- Is there a gift shop here?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.663
I feel like I should get,
I don't know,

02:42.663 --> 02:44.915
a start gift for,
for the new boss.

02:44.915 --> 02:47.376
Maybe like a nice pen
or a paperweight or...

02:47.376 --> 02:49.461
(gasps)
What about a succulent?

02:52.673 --> 02:55.425
Hey, Mary, do you have, like,
scissors or something

02:55.425 --> 02:57.010
- to cut this off with?
- Um...

02:57.010 --> 02:59.137
Sam, new boss just landed. Bullpen.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.931
- What do we know about them?
- It's a he.

03:00.931 --> 03:02.307
Not surprising.
What else?

03:02.307 --> 03:04.267
- White dude.
- Mary.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.478
- I can't find the scissors.
- Anything good?

03:06.478 --> 03:08.188
I heard he's Jon Hamm's
second cousin.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.649
- Interesting.
- He's like '90s New York media.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.484
- Okay.
- Great with writers.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.819
Do we know what publication
he's coming from, or...?

03:13.819 --> 03:15.112
NATHANIEL: Come find me,
my door's always open,

03:15.112 --> 03:17.656
unless it's closed, okay?

03:17.656 --> 03:19.908
Uh, Sammy Fink?

03:19.908 --> 03:22.744
Oh, my God, do you work here?

03:22.744 --> 03:25.080
Guys, I used to work
with Sam a while ago.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.833
She put the "B" in Bzzzzzzzzzz!
It's the last place I worked.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.251
But in an empowering way, right?

03:29.251 --> 03:30.961
It's not like "bitch."
I-I love women.

03:30.961 --> 03:33.004
Listen, let's do
a proper catch-up, okay?

03:33.004 --> 03:34.548
I'm, like, getting
to meet the troops,

03:34.548 --> 03:36.675
but this is awesome to see you.

03:36.675 --> 03:39.052
Anyway, so, yeah,
I like to do nicknames.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.345
You're Charlie, right?

03:40.345 --> 03:41.638
I'm gonna call you
Little Charmander.

03:41.638 --> 03:43.723
The Pokémon, the dragon.
He's super cute.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.434
Uh, Fruit Stripe Gum.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.436
Remember that,
with the horse?

03:47.436 --> 03:49.646
It's like a classic commercial,
look it up.

03:49.646 --> 03:50.856
If you don't wear stripes...

03:50.856 --> 03:53.191
(line ringing)

03:53.191 --> 03:54.860
<i>It's Olivia Elliot.
Keep it short.</i>

03:54.860 --> 03:56.653
- (beep)
- Hi, it's Sam.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.321
I really need to talk to you.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.283
Um, there's a bit
of a situation here.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.827
So, if you could call me back,
that would be so great.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.997
Um, hope you're well,
but either way,

04:06.997 --> 04:08.623
call me back, okay, please?
Bye.

04:08.623 --> 04:11.168
And so, that's when
Graydon Carter told me

04:11.168 --> 04:13.086
he'd never been
to Gray's Papaya.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.630
I'm like, how?
Hey, what's up, Sam?

04:15.630 --> 04:17.466
Where'd you disappear to?

04:17.466 --> 04:19.134
Hey, is that for me?
Is that for my desk?

04:19.134 --> 04:20.343
Uh, yeah, yeah, it is.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.429
Don't hit me with it!
Don't hurt me!

04:22.429 --> 04:24.806
- No, I won't.
- I'm just kidding.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.683
Right?
Yeah.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.602
She-- she told you guys
that story, right?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.270
Sam and I, we go way back.

04:30.270 --> 04:31.688
- Please.
- We worked together,

04:31.688 --> 04:33.982
we were a hot team,
and we had a weird thing.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.901
Like, it's all cool now,

04:35.901 --> 04:37.986
but she hit me in the face
with a phone.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.030
Right, but it's water
under the bridge now, guys,

04:40.030 --> 04:41.364
so we're all good.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.492
But now we got this,
like, funny story.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.869
How long ago was that?
Was that two years ago?

04:45.869 --> 04:47.329
That feels like yesterday.

04:47.329 --> 04:49.206
Like, even my eye socket
still hurts.

04:49.206 --> 04:51.583
I don't know if that's
just 'cause you're here.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.293
Sam?
Where are you going?

04:53.293 --> 04:54.252
I quit.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.382
SAMANTHA:
He looked up at me, and it was
like every horrible thing

04:59.382 --> 05:00.801
I'd ever done while drinking
was staring at me.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.220
I mean, that guy is
a living, walking trigger,

05:03.220 --> 05:04.596
- let me tell you.
- Sounds awful.

05:04.596 --> 05:06.348
It was awful.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.391
And then you just--
you just walked out?

05:08.391 --> 05:09.684
Yeah, I turned around
and I walked out.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.604
Well, I'm sorry that
I missed your calls.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.481
Um, I was just
so nauseous today.

05:14.481 --> 05:15.857
Everything makes me nauseous

05:15.857 --> 05:18.026
except these beautiful
little green suckers.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.821
I feel like if we had connected,
I would have recommended

05:20.821 --> 05:22.864
you take a little more time
with that decision.

05:22.864 --> 05:26.535
Oh.
Well, yeah, but, you know,

05:26.535 --> 05:29.120
I did what I had to do
to protect my sobriety, so...

05:29.120 --> 05:31.331
Your sobriety?
Really?

05:31.331 --> 05:33.542
- Yeah.
- So, if you hadn't
gotten out of there,

05:33.542 --> 05:34.751
you would have had a drink?

05:36.545 --> 05:38.255
- Maybe.
- I'm asking.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.422
Were you protecting
your sobriety,

05:39.422 --> 05:41.216
or were you protecting your ego?

05:41.216 --> 05:43.760
- (scoffs)
- You acted impulsively, Sam.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.220
You know one of the hardest
things for an alcoholic

05:45.220 --> 05:47.013
is to not react in the moment.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.850
Well, you weren't there,
and I had no choice, so...

05:49.850 --> 05:51.560
You always have a choice,
you just need to give yourself

05:51.560 --> 05:52.853
more time to make it.

05:55.313 --> 05:56.690
- I mean, my brain...
- (snaps fingers)

05:56.690 --> 05:58.108
...my brain moves pretty fast,
you know?

05:58.108 --> 05:59.651
So I think I made
the right decision.

05:59.651 --> 06:01.486
Okay, good.
If you think that you made

06:01.486 --> 06:03.363
the right decision,
you made the right decision.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.365
(chuckles)

06:05.365 --> 06:08.326
Bottom line, all men want
the same gift for any occasion.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.745
I gave my new man
a little homemade coupon

06:10.745 --> 06:12.914
for one for his birthday.
It was super cute.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.374
A coupon?
For what?

06:14.374 --> 06:18.378
You know, for... mm-mm.

06:18.378 --> 06:21.631
- Butt stuff?
- No, Felicia.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.259
The other hmm-hmm.

06:24.259 --> 06:26.845
Ah, okay.
I see you, Tina.

06:26.845 --> 06:29.389
- Girl, he's never been happier.
- I bet.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.308
And that one worked for all
my other boyfriends.

06:31.308 --> 06:34.019
I don't know, Pete's different.
He's, like, fancy.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.187
Wow, okay.
You're overthinking it.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.315
Actually, okay, wait.

06:38.315 --> 06:44.029
What if-- hear me out--
I did something artsy with this?

06:45.488 --> 06:46.781
- Ah.
- Put it on a mug?

06:46.781 --> 06:49.326
I think the coupon still works,

06:49.326 --> 06:51.328
but I respect your decision
as a woman.

06:51.328 --> 06:53.038
Thank you, Tina.
I respect your acrylics.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.874
Oh! Thank you.
They're hobbits.

06:55.874 --> 06:59.252
Oh!
Oh, there's Bilbo.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.005
You know, I'm so glad
that we decided to do this.

07:02.005 --> 07:05.383
I'm totally with you
about telling our parents.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.969
Oh, that, that's really good
to hear.

07:07.969 --> 07:09.220
But, you know,
I've just been thinking

07:09.220 --> 07:10.764
that we want to do this
at the right time.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.475
And my parents
are going to Guam.

07:13.475 --> 07:16.436
Well, I mean, Guam, that's,
that's once in a lifetime, so...

07:16.436 --> 07:18.563
And then we run
into the holidays.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.023
It's just a special time for us.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.691
Right, the holidays.
And Guam.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.276
Hello, sweetheart!

07:23.276 --> 07:26.780
JOEL:
Hey, guys! Thanks for coming!

07:26.780 --> 07:28.823
- You invited my parents.
- I did, yeah.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.328
Why are you home?

07:33.328 --> 07:36.414
- Um...
- What?

07:36.414 --> 07:38.500
Okay.
No, no, don't freak out.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.752
Just remain calm.

07:40.752 --> 07:42.379
- What?
- I quit my job.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.838
Did someone try
to Me Too you?

07:43.838 --> 07:46.841
What? No.
It's a long story.

07:46.841 --> 07:50.845
Okay, well... good for you.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.598
- Really?
- Yes.

07:53.598 --> 07:55.850
Wow.
Thank you, Mom.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.143
Olivia was a bit judgy.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.312
Well, she's wrong,

07:59.312 --> 08:00.772
and it wouldn't be
the first time.

08:00.772 --> 08:04.192
If you quit a job
that you liked,

08:04.192 --> 08:05.860
something must have happened.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.362
Exactly.
(scoffs)

08:07.362 --> 08:09.030
Something did happen.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.116
You know, my employment changed
and now it's untenable.

08:11.116 --> 08:13.910
Yes, you see?
There's a reason.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.495
You wouldn't just
suddenly throw away

08:15.495 --> 08:17.163
a perfectly acceptable job.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.832
- Of course not.
- No.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.750
It was spur of the moment,
you know?

08:20.750 --> 08:22.293
- It-it felt right to me.
- Yeah.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.171
You must trust
your gut instinct, Samantha.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.424
The body always knows.

08:27.424 --> 08:30.135
Like when I realized
I can no longer eat gluten.

08:30.135 --> 08:33.179
Well, but you can eat gluten,
'cause we had pasta last night.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.432
I can eat wheat in pasta form

08:35.432 --> 08:36.933
because the Italians
grow it differently.

08:36.933 --> 08:40.854
And, Samantha, mm, Hit Pause?

08:40.854 --> 08:43.648
It's just Bzzzzzzzzzz
under a better name.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.233
- (clicks tongue)
- I mean...

08:45.233 --> 08:47.569
You know
where I think you belong.

08:47.569 --> 08:49.029
Please don't say

08:49.029 --> 08:51.448
<i>The Boston Globe.</i>

08:51.448 --> 08:53.324
- (phone buzzes)
- Oh.

08:53.324 --> 08:55.326
It's gonna be Bob.

08:55.326 --> 08:59.539
When I get back,
let's brainstorm career choices.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.707
I have so many ideas.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.960
I'm excited for you.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.880
You just blew your entire future
wide open.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.969
What the hell, Joel?
You blindsided me.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.679
Huh, yeah, you know
what was kind of a blindside

09:14.679 --> 09:16.139
for me, Brit?

09:16.139 --> 09:18.308
You didn't come home
on our wedding night.

09:18.308 --> 09:20.602
And then, the next morning,
you picked me up

09:20.602 --> 09:22.020
and we went to brunch
with all of our families

09:22.020 --> 09:23.480
like nothing ever happened.

09:23.480 --> 09:25.815
Look, you know my parents.
They're conservative.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.151
They have no context
for divorce.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.861
They're Haitian, that's not
a thing where they grew up.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.696
I can't just drop it on them.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.990
They-they think divorce
only happens on reality TV.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.826
- And I really don't want to.
- That's nice.

09:36.826 --> 09:38.787
You know what,
my life has been hell

09:38.787 --> 09:40.330
for the last six months, okay?

09:40.330 --> 09:41.831
I mean, what are we doing,
like, keeping up

09:41.831 --> 09:43.917
a fake marriage
for your parents?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.835
What is next,
you get fake pregnant,

09:45.835 --> 09:47.712
and then we fake have the baby,

09:47.712 --> 09:49.172
and then we send our kid
to fake college

09:49.172 --> 09:50.715
on a fake soccer scholarship,

09:50.715 --> 09:52.801
and do this
until your parents die?

09:52.801 --> 09:54.552
You can't hold up
my life like this.

09:54.552 --> 09:56.346
Okay, okay.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.185
(whimpers)

10:09.442 --> 10:10.568
Hello.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.821
Hey, what are you doing here?

10:12.821 --> 10:14.948
Um, I was just thinking,
aren't you always complaining

10:14.948 --> 10:16.282
about your receptionist

10:16.282 --> 10:17.992
and how she's, like,
terrible at her job?

10:17.992 --> 10:19.452
(clears throat)

10:19.452 --> 10:21.663
Marisol, you want to take
your break, hon?

10:21.663 --> 10:23.832
Okay.

10:23.832 --> 10:25.625
Yeah, she sucks.
She's always in the bathroom

10:25.625 --> 10:27.544
- taking pics for FeetFinder.
- (gasps)

10:27.544 --> 10:29.420
Granted, the lighting
in there is...

10:29.420 --> 10:31.548
Well, uh, I would officially
like to throw my hat

10:31.548 --> 10:33.216
- in the ring, please.
- For what?

10:33.216 --> 10:34.968
To be your new receptionist.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.845
Sammy, you have a job.

10:36.845 --> 10:40.014
No, I-- I did, but I, um,

10:40.014 --> 10:41.683
I quit this morning, actually.

10:41.683 --> 10:43.726
Oh.
Weird move.

10:43.726 --> 10:44.978
Okay, well, I hate
to break it to you,

10:44.978 --> 10:46.396
but you're never
gonna work here.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.565
- Why?
- We would kill each other.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.150
- (gasps)
- Our friendship would be over.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.027
I'm a tough boss.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.780
No, that's all right.
I-I figured it was a long shot.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.157
You know, I'm glad
you stopped in.

10:57.157 --> 10:59.117
How would you rank
these gifts for Pete?

10:59.117 --> 11:00.869
I-I mean, I barely know him.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.871
Samantha, you literally
rank shit for a living.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.497
I mean, you did.

11:04.497 --> 11:06.916
It was your thing.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.544
(sighs)
It is my thing, isn't it?

11:10.670 --> 11:12.589
Shit.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.799
Your father and I
were just talking.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.926
Did we tell you
we're going on a cruise

11:16.926 --> 11:19.095
to watch the dolphins
while we're in Guam?

11:19.095 --> 11:23.099
Mom... Dad...

11:24.601 --> 11:25.560
Brit?

11:27.061 --> 11:28.396
Yeah, we should order soon,

11:28.396 --> 11:29.939
'cause the food here
takes forever.

11:29.939 --> 11:31.107
Okay, it's clear
you're literally

11:31.107 --> 11:32.233
never doing this, so...

11:32.233 --> 11:36.029
Joel and I are separated.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.033
- We're getting divorced.
- Divorced?

11:40.033 --> 11:41.743
But why?
Are you fighting?

11:59.761 --> 12:01.971
Ah!

12:01.971 --> 12:03.306
(clears throat)

12:08.394 --> 12:10.855
♪ ♪

12:14.275 --> 12:15.777
Yeah, I mean,
it's fine so far.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.487
It's Boston, so whatever, but...

12:17.487 --> 12:19.239
Hey.
You have a sec?

12:22.909 --> 12:23.910
Look, I'm-I'm sorry
about what happened earlier.

12:23.910 --> 12:25.912
I, I'm hoping
we can put that behind us

12:25.912 --> 12:27.830
and start fresh.

12:27.830 --> 12:32.043
I don't know, I just...
I don't think that's possible.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.671
- I...
- Try to see it from my side.

12:34.671 --> 12:37.340
It's my first day, and you quit.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.008
I'm trying to make
a good first impression.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.510
I'm doing, like, the nicknames

12:40.510 --> 12:42.887
and creating this fun dynamic,
and you just walk out?

12:42.887 --> 12:44.389
Okay, can we stop
messing around?

12:44.389 --> 12:46.557
I'm not messing around, Sam.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.142
Like, people out there,
they're gonna think

12:48.142 --> 12:49.769
we either slept together

12:49.769 --> 12:51.896
or that I'm some kind
of monster, or both.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.648
No one's gonna think
we slept together.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.442
Look, I really hope
that you'll reconsider.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.320
- I'm not like that anymore.
- Oh, really?

12:59.320 --> 13:00.738
- Really.
- 'Cause all of that

13:00.738 --> 13:03.157
felt like vintage
Sammy Fink to me.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.535
And listen, I think it's great

13:05.535 --> 13:07.203
that you're working
on yourself, okay?

13:07.203 --> 13:09.414
But you can't do it here,
because you don't work here,

13:09.414 --> 13:10.665
because you quit.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.839
Sam, I'm kidding!

13:17.839 --> 13:19.382
- Oh.
- Are you serious?

13:19.382 --> 13:22.760
You bought that?
Sam, it's me!

13:22.760 --> 13:25.096
I'm not some uptight
corporate douchebag.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.556
- Right.
- Come on, this is,
like, Nathaniel.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.516
We joke around.
I thought we were doing shtick,

13:28.516 --> 13:30.977
and it's a funny story,
and the thing with the plant.

13:30.977 --> 13:33.396
- Right.
- Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.815
No, it's okay, I just, um...

13:35.815 --> 13:37.358
Like, you know
that I'm sober, but...

13:37.358 --> 13:38.735
- Yes.
- These people don't.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.820
And so, when you started
telling that story,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.447
I just kind of freaked out
a little bit, and...

13:42.447 --> 13:44.073
- Let's make this right.
- Okay.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.492
Okay, I want this
to be your community.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.661
I want to be
your support system.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.872
- Oh.
- Okay, so you can
come in anytime...

13:50.872 --> 13:52.832
- That's not necessary.
- ...and just, I'm here for you.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.500
- Okay.
- You know what,
come with me for a second.

13:54.500 --> 13:55.877
I actually want to do something
really quick.

13:55.877 --> 13:57.670
- SAMANTHA: Okay.
- Okay, hey, everybody?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.422
Uh, can I get
everyone's attention real quick?

13:59.422 --> 14:01.132
- You really don't
have to do this, please.
- It's okay, no, I got it.

14:01.132 --> 14:02.425
Just let me-- I want to make
this right, it's okay.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.594
So, we got our Sammy back.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.554
Okay, she had a moment,
I had a moment.

14:06.554 --> 14:08.389
It's on me.
But she's back.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.475
And we need her,
we want her here.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.060
We're like a family.

14:12.060 --> 14:14.604
Families fight, but, like,
it's water under the bridge,

14:14.604 --> 14:16.397
like I said, and this
is just more water.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.982
We're still on the bridge.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.859
You guys all into that?
Right, Fruit Stripe?

14:19.859 --> 14:22.570
- Mm-hmm.
- That's what I thought.
Yeah, Susie Suede!

14:22.570 --> 14:24.989
Listen, we're gonna get
the nicknames figured out.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.991
The most important thing
right now

14:26.991 --> 14:29.619
is that we got Sam back,
and let's give it up for her.

14:29.619 --> 14:30.953
- (whoops)
- SAMANTHA: You don't have to...

14:30.953 --> 14:32.830
- Yeah, Sammy.
- (light applause)

14:32.830 --> 14:34.457
All right, okay, Hit Pause.

14:34.457 --> 14:35.875
Hit Pause, go back to work.

14:35.875 --> 14:39.045
Sam, thank you, all right.
We got Sammy back, whoo!

14:39.045 --> 14:41.089
I'll be in my office.

14:41.089 --> 14:42.965
(indistinct chatter)

14:42.965 --> 14:45.301
- (Samantha sighs)
-  <i>Yeah, yeah ♪</i>

14:45.301 --> 14:47.428
<i>Yeah. ♪</i>

14:47.428 --> 14:49.138
Thank you for lunch, Joel.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.432
It's always nice to see you.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.726
- JOEL: You, too.
- Brit.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.478
(door opens)

14:55.478 --> 14:58.064
Well, that's done.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.859
Is that all you're gonna say?

15:01.859 --> 15:04.529
I did what you wanted.
A "thank you" might be nice.

15:04.529 --> 15:08.199
Okay, uh, thank you
for backing me into a corner

15:08.199 --> 15:10.243
and forcing an awkward moment
with your family.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.995
Okay, this isn't about you.

15:12.995 --> 15:15.540
Did you see how upset
my parents were with me?

15:15.540 --> 15:17.166
Look, I get it.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.835
You don't like
to disappoint anybody,

15:18.835 --> 15:20.962
and you did.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.338
You just got to accept that.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.805
<i>Let yourself go ♪</i>

15:33.391 --> 15:34.851

15:43.442 --> 15:45.027
- Cheers.
- Congrats.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.321
Mm-mm.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.157
No, please, you didn't have
to get me anything.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.658
Of course I did.

15:50.658 --> 15:52.326
You know, I thought about
a couple of ways to go,

15:52.326 --> 15:56.080
but I feel like this kinda
just crystallizes how I feel.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.249
Happy passing your boards.

15:58.249 --> 16:00.293
Oh. Crypto.

16:01.752 --> 16:03.629
- You bought me crypto.
- That's right.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.214
You're in business, baby.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.216
In two months you'll be able
to buy a BMW,

16:07.216 --> 16:09.635
or if the market crashes,
just the "B."

16:09.635 --> 16:11.345
"Best wishes, Felicia."

16:11.345 --> 16:13.181
Yeah, that--
that's respectful, right?

16:13.181 --> 16:14.974
And no one's mad at wishes.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.268
- (chuckles)
- Okay.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.271
Thanks.

16:20.271 --> 16:22.064
- Oh, God, what's wrong?
- I just...

16:24.150 --> 16:25.985
I thought we were closer
than this.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.029
You know, "Best wishes"
is something that you get

16:28.029 --> 16:31.157
from your great-aunt
when you've never even met her.

16:31.157 --> 16:35.161
I mean, we've done dinner
with both our parents.

16:35.161 --> 16:36.662
I've met Zack.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.749
Maybe I've just been
reading it all wrong, I...

16:39.749 --> 16:41.083
(sighs)

16:42.210 --> 16:43.711
I just really like you.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.422
I really like you, too, I...

16:46.422 --> 16:47.882
(sighs)
I just, like, didn't want to go

16:47.882 --> 16:49.592
too intense, you know?

16:49.592 --> 16:51.219
And we're from
two different worlds, Pete.

16:51.219 --> 16:52.803
So?

16:52.803 --> 16:55.306
I'm jumping into whatever world
you're offering.

16:56.641 --> 16:58.684
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.062
Yeah, I'll take all of it.

17:01.062 --> 17:04.482
Your sparkling personality,
how hot you are.

17:04.482 --> 17:06.192
Stop.

17:06.192 --> 17:08.027
The way you say "martini."

17:08.027 --> 17:10.196
- Martini.
- Ooh, yeah.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.365
(laughing):
See?

17:12.365 --> 17:13.658
You light up a room.

17:15.034 --> 17:18.120
I'm not saying
that we have to say

17:18.120 --> 17:20.539
- those three little words yet.
- Yeah.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.502
But you got to know,
you have my heart.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.547
You know what,
let me just take it back.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.216
No, no, no, you can't do that,
that's my crypto.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.385
No, you can keep the crypto.
(laughs)

17:32.385 --> 17:33.678
No, I just...

17:35.179 --> 17:38.724
I owe it to you
to be as genuine as possible.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.476
<i>Come around ♪</i>

17:40.476 --> 17:42.520
<i>All I can say is ooh-la-la ♪</i>

17:42.520 --> 17:44.855
<i>♪ Ooh-la-la,
ooh-la-la, ooh ♪</i>

17:44.855 --> 17:48.234
<i>♪ Oh, I can't help,
you turn me on so bad ♪</i>

17:48.234 --> 17:50.069
<i>Ooh-la-la, ooh. ♪</i>

17:50.069 --> 17:51.320
Thank you.

17:52.738 --> 17:55.116
So, um, I actually have
a gift for you.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.993
You ready?

17:56.993 --> 17:58.619
You were right.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.329
(laughs)

18:00.329 --> 18:01.914
Three best words
in the English language.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.625
- Not "I love you"?
- Ew, no.

18:04.625 --> 18:06.043
I've heard both.
"You were right" is better.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.878
Okay, tell me more
about how great I am.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.381
Um, I mean,
I was protecting my ego,

18:10.381 --> 18:12.550
and I can't control anyone,
especially Nathaniel.

18:14.051 --> 18:17.013
I just, I love that job
too much to walk away, you know.

18:17.013 --> 18:19.390
You figured out how to sit
in the discomfort.

18:19.390 --> 18:20.975
- So proud of you.
- Thanks.

18:20.975 --> 18:22.393
Proud of me, too.

18:23.894 --> 18:25.771
I couldn't have done it
without you, per usual.

18:25.771 --> 18:29.650
Right, about that, um...

18:29.650 --> 18:31.235
There's been a change of plans.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.449
I'm moving to Maine.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.117
(laughs)

18:39.952 --> 18:41.537
What? Why?

18:41.537 --> 18:42.913
I have to go on bed rest.

18:44.582 --> 18:48.502
Okay, well, I mean,
you have a huge, fancy house.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.087
Can't you go on bed rest here?

18:50.087 --> 18:52.089
Yeah, Stephanie's flying
all around right now,

18:52.089 --> 18:55.509
helping people find
their inner girl Boston.

18:55.509 --> 18:56.636
I'm gonna go stay
with my sister.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.473
Look, I know this is hard.

19:03.351 --> 19:05.102
I can't be
an effective sponsor right now.

19:05.102 --> 19:08.147
I mean, yeah, you can.
We can FaceTime and text.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.441
Sam, you're not a newcomer.
I want you to know,

19:10.441 --> 19:13.110
you have the sober foundation
to get through.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.862
Yeah, but that's because of you. I...

19:16.489 --> 19:18.741
Well, I don't know if I can
do this without you.

19:20.076 --> 19:21.661
I'm sorry, I have to prioritize
my health now.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.374
(sighs)
Okay.

19:26.374 --> 19:27.875
Listen to me, you need something
for the moments

19:27.875 --> 19:29.710
I can't be with you.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.337
Humans are fallible.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.757
You need a higher power.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.676
Seriously, abandoning me
and then telling me

19:36.676 --> 19:39.512
- to go find God?
- I never said God.

19:39.512 --> 19:41.847
Your higher power
can be anything.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.642
It can be the sound of birds
when the sun's rising.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.686
- Ew.
- It can be
a really good mug of tea.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.731
My point is, you need
something to hold onto

19:50.731 --> 19:52.858
so you can catch your breath.

19:52.858 --> 19:54.568
Say the serenity prayer.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.989
Mouth the lyrics
to a catchy song,

19:58.989 --> 20:01.367
recite a poem-- just something
to get you through, okay?

20:02.868 --> 20:03.869
Okay.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.457
Would it help if I said
it's not you, it's me?

20:08.457 --> 20:10.209
(chuckles)
This isn't exactly the way

20:10.209 --> 20:11.335
I planned it.

20:12.795 --> 20:14.255
It helps a little.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.800
I'm gonna miss you.

20:22.722 --> 20:25.725
So, I don't know,
what do we do now?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.351
How do we say goodbye?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.698
Goodbye.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.913
