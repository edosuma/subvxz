WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:04.546
Malcolm, Malcolm, in school,

00:01.919 --> 00:04.546
we learned the coolest thing.

00:04.588 --> 00:06.548
There were these people

00:04.588 --> 00:06.548
who did this broadcast

00:06.590 --> 00:08.926
and convinced everyone

00:06.590 --> 00:08.926
that aliens were landing.

00:08.968 --> 00:09.760
So, what we do

00:09.802 --> 00:11.637
is we wait for Reese

00:09.802 --> 00:11.637
to fall asleep,

00:11.679 --> 00:14.055
then we flash some lights

00:11.679 --> 00:14.055
outside his window,

00:14.097 --> 00:16.475
and we go to the TV,

00:14.097 --> 00:16.475
but we'll have made a tape...

00:16.517 --> 00:18.727
Dewey, you're totally

00:16.517 --> 00:18.727
overthinking this.

00:18.769 --> 00:22.397
Reese, aliens landed

00:18.769 --> 00:22.397
down the street!

00:23.273 --> 00:25.024
Every man for himself!

00:27.194 --> 00:28.529

01:05.649 --> 01:07.484
Mom is coming home a week early

01:05.649 --> 01:07.484
from Aunt Susan's.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.486
We did all right with her gone,

01:07.526 --> 01:09.486
but we still have

01:09.528 --> 01:12.573
a couple things to take care of

01:09.528 --> 01:12.573
before she gets back.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.747
Move it, move it.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.041
Now, remember, boys,

01:19.788 --> 01:22.041
if you see the bobcat,

01:22.082 --> 01:22.958
don't be a hero.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.543
Stand on a chair

01:23.000 --> 01:24.543
and use your whistle.

01:24.585 --> 01:27.462
Get out of here, Foamy! Go home!

01:30.049 --> 01:31.717
You think she'll notice

01:30.049 --> 01:31.717
the grass fire?

01:31.759 --> 01:33.134
Just remember,

01:31.759 --> 01:33.134
as far as we know,

01:33.176 --> 01:36.137
Dewey has always been missing

01:33.176 --> 01:36.137
the tip of his finger.

01:36.179 --> 01:37.138
HAL:

01:36.179 --> 01:37.138
Boys, we're home.

01:37.180 --> 01:39.975
Oh, boys, I've missed you so!

01:40.017 --> 01:42.019
Dad knocked down

01:40.017 --> 01:42.019
your bedroom wall.

01:42.061 --> 01:44.103
What?

01:48.609 --> 01:50.819
Honey, I-I know

01:48.609 --> 01:50.819
it doesn't look like much,

01:50.861 --> 01:53.154
but this is just

01:50.861 --> 01:53.154
the beginning stages

01:53.196 --> 01:54.155
of a major expansion.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.240
I have

01:54.197 --> 01:55.240
conceptual drawings here.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.575
Look, look.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.243
See how it continues

01:56.617 --> 01:58.243
onto my hand?

01:58.285 --> 02:01.162
It was going to be something

01:58.285 --> 02:01.162
really nice for you and the baby

02:01.204 --> 02:02.998
with a window seat,

02:01.204 --> 02:02.998
and please just promise

02:03.040 --> 02:04.458
you won't get mad

02:03.040 --> 02:04.458
and leave again!

02:04.499 --> 02:08.003
Hal, I'm just so glad

02:04.499 --> 02:08.003
to be home!

02:08.045 --> 02:09.088
Oh!

02:09.129 --> 02:11.548
Ugh! My sister

02:09.129 --> 02:11.548
is the most obnoxious,

02:11.590 --> 02:14.635
sanctimonious know-it-all

02:11.590 --> 02:14.635
I've ever met.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.971
She spent every

02:14.676 --> 02:16.971
minute of my visit

02:17.012 --> 02:19.389
telling me everything I've

02:17.012 --> 02:19.389
ever done wrong in my life.

02:19.431 --> 02:20.641
It was just awful.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.683
Tell me about it.

02:21.725 --> 02:24.019
Dating her was the worst

02:21.725 --> 02:24.019
five years of my life.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.271
Well, you know why she's

02:24.061 --> 02:26.271
like that, don't you?

02:26.313 --> 02:27.355
My parents.

02:27.397 --> 02:29.024
Susan was always

02:27.397 --> 02:29.024
the pretty one,

02:29.066 --> 02:32.444
Susan was the smart one, Susan

02:29.066 --> 02:32.444
was the one with all the talent.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.905
I was the one that couldn't

02:32.486 --> 02:34.905
do anything right.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.032
Hal, it got me

02:34.947 --> 02:37.032
thinking about Reese.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.659
As if you weren't feeling

02:37.074 --> 02:38.659
bad enough.

02:38.700 --> 02:42.037
No, Hal, I don't think that

02:38.700 --> 02:42.037
we give Reese enough credit.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.915
I think that if we gave Reese

02:42.079 --> 02:44.915
a little more responsibility,

02:44.957 --> 02:46.583
he would rise

02:44.957 --> 02:46.583
to the challenge.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.251
Now, I'm not talking

02:46.625 --> 02:48.251
about giving him

02:48.293 --> 02:49.920
a key to the house,

02:48.293 --> 02:49.920
or anything.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.673
I just think some encouragement

02:49.962 --> 02:52.673
would do him good.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.716
Okay.

02:52.714 --> 02:54.716
(birds chirping)

02:54.758 --> 02:55.509
Ooh.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.260
Honey, come here.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.179
The eggs have hatched.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.935
Morning.

03:06.185 --> 03:08.271
Dewey, Mom's home.

03:08.313 --> 03:09.439
Huh?

03:09.481 --> 03:12.317
Oh. Right.

03:12.359 --> 03:13.318
So, it's going to cost

03:13.360 --> 03:15.863
at least $800

03:13.360 --> 03:15.863
to close up the wall.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.239
I suppose I can go back

03:15.904 --> 03:18.239
to work at the drugstore.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.407
Really?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.407
Yeah.

03:19.449 --> 03:20.408
I'm sure I can stand

03:20.450 --> 03:22.285
on my feet

03:20.450 --> 03:22.285
for eight hours a day.

03:22.327 --> 03:24.287
And if you fall,

03:22.327 --> 03:24.287
the amniotic fluid

03:24.329 --> 03:25.747
provides a great cushion.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.166
We'll think of something.

03:27.206 --> 03:28.291
MALCOLM: Hey, there's

03:27.206 --> 03:28.291
tons of stuff

03:28.333 --> 03:29.459
we don't use

03:28.333 --> 03:29.459
in the garage.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.294
Why don't we just put it out

03:29.501 --> 03:31.294
on the front lawn

03:31.336 --> 03:32.253
and see if we can sell it?

03:32.295 --> 03:33.881
You mean like

03:32.295 --> 03:33.881
a garage sale?

03:33.922 --> 03:35.507
That's a terrific idea, Reese.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.258
Don't you think

03:35.549 --> 03:37.258
that's a great idea, Hal?

03:37.300 --> 03:38.259
Actually,

03:37.300 --> 03:38.259
I was the one...

03:38.301 --> 03:39.761
And you know what?

03:39.803 --> 03:41.722
You can be

03:39.803 --> 03:41.722
in charge.

03:41.763 --> 03:43.431
You can organize the stuff,

03:41.763 --> 03:43.431
you can set the prices,

03:43.473 --> 03:44.349
you can pick the date.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.934
Why? I didn't

03:44.391 --> 03:45.934
do anything.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.268
Reese, this isn't a punishment.

03:47.310 --> 03:49.312
This is us demonstrating

03:47.310 --> 03:49.312
our faith in you,

03:49.354 --> 03:50.522
because I know

03:50.564 --> 03:53.274
you are going to do a great job.

03:53.316 --> 03:54.484
We believe in you.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.736
Don't we, Hal?

03:55.777 --> 03:58.279
For God's sakes, he's my son.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.656
I mean, I love him.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.282
Just answer the question, Hal.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.869
Who wants juice?

04:03.911 --> 04:05.620
I do!

04:06.997 --> 04:08.289
FRANCIS: You can't just sell

04:06.997 --> 04:08.289
all my old stuff.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.708
Everything in that garage

04:09.750 --> 04:11.960
represents a precious

04:09.750 --> 04:11.960
childhood memory.

04:12.002 --> 04:14.337
It's a bunch of old magazines,

04:12.002 --> 04:14.337
a broken yo-yo

04:14.379 --> 04:16.757
and a Rubik's cube

04:14.379 --> 04:16.757
painted all one color.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.550
Well, you try and solve

04:16.798 --> 04:18.550
that thing!

04:18.592 --> 04:19.801
I'm not going to argue with you.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.929
You have ten seconds

04:19.843 --> 04:21.929
to come up with a good reason

04:21.970 --> 04:22.971
to keep all that junk,

04:23.013 --> 04:24.014
or I'm getting rid of it.

04:24.056 --> 04:26.016
See, this is why

04:24.056 --> 04:26.016
you are a terrible mother.

04:26.058 --> 04:28.393
Because everything has to be

04:26.058 --> 04:28.393
a competition with you!

04:28.435 --> 04:29.477
Oh, it does not.

04:29.519 --> 04:31.312
I'm hanging up!

04:29.519 --> 04:31.312
I'm hanging up first.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.023
No, I'm hanging...

04:31.354 --> 04:33.023
Damn it!

04:33.065 --> 04:36.193
You mustn't talk about

04:33.065 --> 04:36.193
your family like that, Francis.

04:36.235 --> 04:39.279
There is nothing

04:36.235 --> 04:39.279
more important than...

04:41.615 --> 04:45.119
It's a letter from

04:41.615 --> 04:45.119
our son, Rutger!

04:45.160 --> 04:46.703
We must hide

04:45.160 --> 04:46.703
this immediately.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.748
Why do you have to hide

04:46.745 --> 04:49.748
a letter from your son?

04:50.373 --> 04:51.332
Otto, no!

04:51.374 --> 04:52.626
What are you doing?

04:52.667 --> 04:54.836
Nothing, because this

04:52.667 --> 04:54.836
did not happen.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.213
Nothing happened.

04:56.255 --> 04:58.632
Except for me telling you

04:56.255 --> 04:58.632
that nothing happened.

04:58.673 --> 05:00.217
That happened, but only that.

05:00.259 --> 05:03.386
Things will begin

05:00.259 --> 05:03.386
to happen again, starting...

05:03.428 --> 05:04.805
now!

05:04.846 --> 05:07.348
Oh, look, the mail came.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.558
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.061
Soon as the swelling

05:08.600 --> 05:11.061
in my ankles goes down,

05:11.103 --> 05:13.396
I'm going to get right back

05:11.103 --> 05:13.396
to work with you boys.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.439
Thank you, honey.

05:14.481 --> 05:17.358
No matter what it

05:14.481 --> 05:17.358
does to the baby.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.194
Reese, if you put

05:17.400 --> 05:19.194
the heavy boxes down first,

05:19.236 --> 05:20.862
and  then  stack

05:19.236 --> 05:20.862
the light ones on top...

05:20.904 --> 05:24.199
It just kills you I'm

05:20.904 --> 05:24.199
in charge, doesn't it?

05:24.241 --> 05:25.325
(glass crunches)

05:26.326 --> 05:28.245
Oh, wow!

05:28.287 --> 05:29.370
What's that?

05:29.412 --> 05:30.580
This is the transmitter

05:30.622 --> 05:33.292
from the pirate radio station

05:30.622 --> 05:33.292
I had in college!

05:33.333 --> 05:35.585
It was only a couple of watts,

05:33.333 --> 05:35.585
but I brought the truth

05:35.627 --> 05:38.546
to everyone within three blocks

05:35.627 --> 05:38.546
of the west side of campus.

05:38.588 --> 05:39.714
Until the FCC

05:39.756 --> 05:42.592
shut me down

05:39.756 --> 05:42.592
for telling it like it was.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.845
And for not having a license.

05:44.886 --> 05:46.805
See, the way it works...

05:46.847 --> 05:48.098
I was just trying to be polite.

05:48.140 --> 05:51.143
I didn't think you were going

05:48.140 --> 05:51.143
to punish me for it.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.604
Hey, there, Sparky.

05:54.646 --> 05:55.814
So, half the campus is

05:55.856 --> 05:57.398
goose-stepping down

05:55.856 --> 05:57.398
to the bonfire

05:57.440 --> 06:00.777
to be brainwashed

05:57.440 --> 06:00.777
by the Stepford cheerleaders--

06:00.819 --> 06:02.863
the pied pipers of pep.

06:02.904 --> 06:06.283
They want us to forget

06:02.904 --> 06:06.283
why we came to this institution,

06:06.325 --> 06:08.035
but not Kid Charlemagne.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.911
I am here to seek knowledge.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.039
Let's get going, Hal.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.042
And don't forget your head.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.961
Righty-o.

06:20.505 --> 06:22.423
I remember this toy.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.259
I begged for it for months.

06:24.301 --> 06:26.845
It was supposed to move and talk

06:24.301 --> 06:26.845
and learn my name.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.348
But the stupid thing

06:26.887 --> 06:29.348
never worked.

06:29.388 --> 06:31.892
Robot, robot, robot,

06:31.933 --> 06:34.978
robot, robot, robot...

06:39.482 --> 06:42.443
Okay, now I need

06:39.482 --> 06:42.443
a five-inch girder.

06:42.485 --> 06:43.904
Coming right up.

06:48.491 --> 06:52.495
Hey, look, my baseball glove.

06:53.496 --> 06:56.791
Hey, look, my baseball glove.

06:58.377 --> 07:00.128
Dad, is this yours?

07:00.170 --> 07:01.380
No, it must have

07:00.170 --> 07:01.380
been my roommate's.

07:01.420 --> 07:03.506
You know, I think

07:01.420 --> 07:03.506
it might be something...

07:03.548 --> 07:04.966
Throw it out.

07:03.548 --> 07:04.966
It's garbage.

07:05.008 --> 07:07.135
Reese, maybe we should

07:05.008 --> 07:07.135
try to find out what it is.

07:07.177 --> 07:08.136
Mom!

07:08.178 --> 07:10.180
Malcolm's not respecting

07:08.178 --> 07:10.180
my leadership!

07:10.222 --> 07:12.473
LOIS: Malcolm, you respect

07:10.222 --> 07:12.473
Reese's leadership!

07:12.515 --> 07:14.434
(glass crunches)

07:23.735 --> 07:27.488
♪ Jeremiah was a bullfrog... ♪

07:27.530 --> 07:29.490
Ooh, come on.

07:29.532 --> 07:30.742
Come on.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.911
(static crackling)

07:32.953 --> 07:34.955
(song continues over radio)

07:34.996 --> 07:36.497
Yes!

07:36.539 --> 07:37.791
He said he'd return.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.584
He couldn't be silenced.

07:39.626 --> 07:42.503
Kid Charlemagne

07:39.626 --> 07:42.503
is back on the air.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.880
GRETCHEN:

07:42.545 --> 07:43.880
Otto always planned

07:43.922 --> 07:45.424
that when Rutger

07:43.922 --> 07:45.424
finished college,

07:45.465 --> 07:48.135
he would come out here  und

07:45.465 --> 07:48.135
live with us on the ranch.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.511
But instead, he insisted

07:48.176 --> 07:50.511
on going to medical school.

07:50.553 --> 07:52.973
And when he was named chief

07:50.553 --> 07:52.973
surgeon of his hospital,

07:53.014 --> 07:54.433
Otto was crushed.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.976
It's so strange he never

07:56.017 --> 07:57.102
mentioned any of this.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.354
That is Otto's

07:57.144 --> 07:59.354
Teutonic pride.

07:59.396 --> 08:02.983
He will never, ever show

07:59.396 --> 08:02.983
his feelings to anyone.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.192
OTTO (crying):

08:03.024 --> 08:04.192
Welcome to the Grotto.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.195
I'm sure you will

08:04.234 --> 08:07.195
enjoy your stay.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.363
(blowing nose)

08:08.405 --> 08:12.533
And don't forget to

08:08.405 --> 08:12.533
visit the gift shop.

08:12.575 --> 08:14.535
(crying)

08:14.577 --> 08:16.246
Oh... perhaps tomorrow,

08:16.288 --> 08:19.624
you would like to

08:16.288 --> 08:19.624
go horseback riding

08:19.666 --> 08:22.043
on Uncle Otto's pony!

08:22.085 --> 08:24.087
(crying loudly)

08:25.839 --> 08:27.382
LOIS:

08:25.839 --> 08:27.382
Malcolm, dinner!

08:27.424 --> 08:30.469
Hal, I'm not going

08:27.424 --> 08:30.469
to call you again!

08:30.510 --> 08:31.761
There are so many things

08:31.803 --> 08:34.222
the government

08:31.803 --> 08:34.222
doesn't want you to know,

08:34.264 --> 08:38.226
and that's why they don't want

08:34.264 --> 08:38.226
Kid Charlemagne on this mic.

08:38.268 --> 08:40.561
Do I love my country? Yes.

08:40.603 --> 08:41.855
Do I vote?

08:41.896 --> 08:44.774
I used to, until they moved

08:41.896 --> 08:44.774
our polling place

08:44.816 --> 08:46.609
to the house with the big dog.

08:46.651 --> 08:49.112
LOIS:

08:46.651 --> 08:49.112
Hal! I said dinner!

08:53.616 --> 08:55.452
Kid Charlemagne is

08:53.616 --> 08:55.452
back on the air.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.871
I think we should start

08:55.494 --> 08:57.871
the garage sale around 7:00,

08:57.912 --> 09:00.374
because serious shoppers

08:57.912 --> 09:00.374
like to get an early start.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.833
Unless you have

09:00.415 --> 09:01.833
a different idea,

09:01.875 --> 09:03.584
which I'm sure would be great.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.752
I was thinking 11:30.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.587
So I could watch cartoons.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.881
Oh, so you'll be

09:07.922 --> 09:10.967
well rested

09:07.922 --> 09:10.967
and better able to focus.

09:11.009 --> 09:12.677
Good thinking.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.262
Where were you

09:12.719 --> 09:14.262
this afternoon?

09:14.304 --> 09:17.391
I instructed you to separate the

09:14.304 --> 09:17.391
twist ties according to length.

09:17.432 --> 09:18.850
He's been like

09:17.432 --> 09:18.850
this all day.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.185
I was doing homework.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.854
No homework takes

09:20.227 --> 09:22.854
more than 20 minutes.

09:22.896 --> 09:24.856
Hal, what are you

09:22.896 --> 09:24.856
doing out there?

09:24.898 --> 09:26.107
I've been gone for six weeks,

09:26.149 --> 09:27.859
and now that I'm home,

09:26.149 --> 09:27.859
I barely see you.

09:27.901 --> 09:28.860
I missed you, too.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.611
Why don't I put

09:28.902 --> 09:30.611
on some music?

09:30.653 --> 09:33.323
What is this childish need

09:30.653 --> 09:33.323
you have to defy my authority?

09:33.365 --> 09:35.200
Bite me.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.200
Just when I was starting

09:35.242 --> 09:36.659
to feel confident

09:35.242 --> 09:36.659
in my abilities.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.620
Malcolm, I am sick of you always

09:36.701 --> 09:39.620
putting your brother down.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.123
This is Reese's project, and you

09:39.662 --> 09:42.123
are going to be supportive.

09:42.165 --> 09:44.000
HAL: And if the government

09:42.165 --> 09:44.000
doesn't have a car

09:44.042 --> 09:45.626
that runs on water,

09:44.042 --> 09:45.626
then what are they

09:45.668 --> 09:47.421
building all those dams for?

09:47.462 --> 09:49.089
Reese is in charge

09:47.462 --> 09:49.089
of this garage sale,

09:49.130 --> 09:50.424
and you are going

09:49.130 --> 09:50.424
to obey him.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.008
No matter

09:50.465 --> 09:52.008
what he asks you to do,

09:52.050 --> 09:53.093
you are going to do it.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.677
But he's...

09:53.134 --> 09:54.677
Malcolm, you can either let him

09:54.719 --> 09:56.471
be in charge of you

09:54.719 --> 09:56.471
for the garage sale,

09:56.513 --> 09:58.723
or you can let him

09:56.513 --> 09:58.723
be in charge of you

09:58.765 --> 10:01.518
every day for the rest

09:58.765 --> 10:01.518
of your life.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.561
HAL: In case

10:01.560 --> 10:02.561
you haven't noticed,

10:02.602 --> 10:05.313
"Evian" spelled backwards

10:02.602 --> 10:05.313
is "naive"!

10:05.355 --> 10:06.273
Wow, it's like

10:06.314 --> 10:08.649
that guy is saying

10:06.314 --> 10:08.649
what we're all thinking.

10:08.691 --> 10:09.943
Hal, will you

10:09.984 --> 10:11.069
turn that racket off?

10:11.111 --> 10:13.154
Well, I guess I can't expect

10:13.196 --> 10:16.533
a suburban housewife

10:13.196 --> 10:16.533
to understand.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.291
Dewey, what are you doing?

10:24.332 --> 10:26.751
A tennis ball doesn't go

10:24.332 --> 10:26.751
with the football.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.753
It goes

10:26.793 --> 10:28.753
with the ceramic bananas.

10:28.795 --> 10:29.754
This is stupid.

10:29.796 --> 10:31.756
Why are we sorting everything

10:29.796 --> 10:31.756
by color?

10:31.798 --> 10:32.924
Because I say so.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.676
And because alphabetical order

10:32.966 --> 10:35.676
was slowing us down.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.971
Us?

10:38.012 --> 10:39.180
This better be good.

10:39.222 --> 10:40.348
There'll be hell to pay

10:40.390 --> 10:42.267
if Jellybean wakes up

10:40.390 --> 10:42.267
from her massage

10:42.309 --> 10:44.685
and doesn't see me

10:42.309 --> 10:44.685
on the table next to her.

10:44.727 --> 10:45.770
(gasps):

10:44.727 --> 10:45.770
Oh, my God!

10:45.812 --> 10:47.147
Is that a Nortair?

10:47.188 --> 10:49.357
It's a Nortair 680b.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.610
It's, like, the first

10:49.399 --> 10:51.610
personal computer ever made.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.861
You have an interest in this

10:51.651 --> 10:53.861
type of stuff, don't you?

10:53.903 --> 10:55.113
There aren't many

10:53.903 --> 10:55.113
of these left.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.491
I'll give you

10:55.155 --> 10:57.491
five bucks for it.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.533
Yeah, right.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.326
I checked online.

10:59.367 --> 11:00.701
This is in

10:59.367 --> 11:00.701
mint condition.

11:00.743 --> 11:01.953
It's worth at

11:00.743 --> 11:01.953
least $1,300.

11:01.995 --> 11:02.996
Deal. No take-backs,

11:03.037 --> 11:04.705
double black magic,

11:03.037 --> 11:04.705
tap it, bomb it,

11:04.747 --> 11:06.040
flush it down the toilet.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.126
You understand it's going

11:06.082 --> 11:08.126
to take me a couple days

11:08.168 --> 11:10.711
to get the money.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.711
That's exactly what I want.

11:10.753 --> 11:11.712
I want you to buy it

11:11.754 --> 11:13.381
this Saturday

11:11.754 --> 11:13.381
at our garage sale.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.799
In front of everybody.

11:13.423 --> 11:14.799
With cash.

11:14.841 --> 11:16.717
You're going to react in horror

11:16.759 --> 11:19.179
when I tell you Reese was going

11:16.759 --> 11:19.179
to throw this in the trash.

11:19.220 --> 11:20.305
And then

11:19.220 --> 11:20.305
you're going

11:20.347 --> 11:21.431
to tell everyone they should

11:21.473 --> 11:23.016
have listened to  me  all along.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.351
You know, right now

11:24.392 --> 11:26.186
you're sounding a lot

11:24.392 --> 11:26.186
like a James Bond villain.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.563
Me? There's nothing

11:26.227 --> 11:28.563
wrong with me.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.648
I'm fine.

11:29.730 --> 11:30.773
And right.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.983
And  right!

11:32.025 --> 11:32.817
And on Saturday,

11:32.859 --> 11:35.403
everyone's going to know it.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.615
Okay, but these revenge plans

11:35.445 --> 11:38.615
have a way of backfiring.

11:38.657 --> 11:39.740
Word to the wise,

11:39.782 --> 11:41.951
if you ever make someone

11:39.782 --> 11:41.951
an Ex-Lax milkshake,

11:41.993 --> 11:44.371
don't do it on an empty stomach.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.206
HAL (over radio):

11:44.412 --> 11:46.206
Someone is looking down at you

11:46.247 --> 11:48.749
from a satellite with his finger

11:46.247 --> 11:48.749
on the death beam,

11:48.791 --> 11:50.751
and somewhere,

11:48.791 --> 11:50.751
someone is watching him.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.753
But who's watching that...

11:52.795 --> 11:54.464
(signal fades)

12:05.892 --> 12:06.976
(siren whoops)

12:07.018 --> 12:08.144
(gasps)

12:08.186 --> 12:10.021
Oh, no! Oh, no.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.607
(whimpers)

12:15.443 --> 12:18.405
Sir, do you know why

12:15.443 --> 12:18.405
I pulled you over?

12:18.446 --> 12:21.157
Certainly not for operating

12:18.446 --> 12:21.157
an illegal pirate radio station.

12:21.199 --> 12:23.243
I mean, even if I did

12:21.199 --> 12:23.243
have the equipment in college,

12:23.284 --> 12:25.412
I wouldn't have kept it

12:23.284 --> 12:25.412
and be using it today.

12:25.453 --> 12:26.871
What's with all these questions,

12:25.453 --> 12:26.871
anyway?

12:26.913 --> 12:28.164
Do you have a warrant?!

12:28.206 --> 12:30.791
You ran a stop sign

12:28.206 --> 12:30.791
a half mile back.

12:30.833 --> 12:31.834
What?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.253
There's no stop sign back there.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.672
It's at the driveway

12:33.294 --> 12:35.672
to the country club.

12:35.714 --> 12:36.839
They just put it up.

12:38.466 --> 12:41.720
That stop sign is

12:38.466 --> 12:41.720
a declaration of war!

12:41.760 --> 12:43.012
It's for the fat cats

12:43.054 --> 12:44.805
up on top of the hill

12:43.054 --> 12:44.805
playing golf

12:44.847 --> 12:47.434
while us regular Joes are late

12:44.847 --> 12:47.434
for our second job,

12:47.475 --> 12:49.810
or church or dinner

12:47.475 --> 12:49.810
with our families.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.271
"Well, I'm sorry

12:51.312 --> 12:53.273
"I missed Little Bobby's

12:51.312 --> 12:53.273
first steps, honey,

12:53.314 --> 12:55.483
"but I had to come

12:53.314 --> 12:55.483
to a complete stop

12:55.525 --> 12:59.987
just because those robber barons

12:55.525 --> 12:59.987
can't look both ways!"

13:00.029 --> 13:02.240
Gretchen, what

13:00.029 --> 13:02.240
are you doing?

13:02.282 --> 13:03.824
I was just going

13:02.282 --> 13:03.824
through some

13:03.866 --> 13:05.702
of Rutger's things

13:03.866 --> 13:05.702
from when he was a boy.

13:05.744 --> 13:06.827
(whinnies)

13:06.869 --> 13:08.371
(laughs)

13:10.373 --> 13:13.834
Boy, I don't remember

13:10.373 --> 13:13.834
that he was so fat.

13:13.876 --> 13:14.877
(gasps)

13:14.919 --> 13:15.836
Schlupi!

13:15.878 --> 13:17.297
Who's Schlupi?

13:17.338 --> 13:19.840
Otto and Rutger used

13:17.338 --> 13:19.840
to love Schlupi.

13:19.882 --> 13:21.342
Otto would put Schlupi on,

13:21.384 --> 13:23.844
and Rutger would laugh

13:21.384 --> 13:23.844
and laugh.

13:23.886 --> 13:24.721
It was almost

13:24.763 --> 13:26.473
like a little brother to him.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.848
(laughs)

13:27.890 --> 13:30.935
Schlupi could say all of

13:27.890 --> 13:30.935
the things that Otto couldn't.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.729
Like, "Go to bed."

13:32.771 --> 13:34.481
And "Behave yourself."

13:34.522 --> 13:37.442
And "Take your finger

13:34.522 --> 13:37.442
out of there, it's disgusting!"

13:37.484 --> 13:38.526
(laughs)

13:38.568 --> 13:41.862
Oh, the love in that house.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.906
And now...

13:43.948 --> 13:46.743
it's gone.

13:46.785 --> 13:48.453
Gretchen, I hate

13:46.785 --> 13:48.453
seeing you so upset.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.330
You've got to talk

13:48.495 --> 13:50.330
to Otto about this.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.039
There is no getting through

13:50.371 --> 13:52.039
to him.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.125
He won't even admit

13:52.081 --> 13:54.125
that anything is wrong.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.545
OTTO (crying):

13:54.167 --> 13:57.545
Oh!

13:57.587 --> 13:58.129
Oh... Oh.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.798
♪ Oklahoma ♪

13:59.838 --> 14:02.592
♪ Where the wind comes

13:59.838 --> 14:02.592
sweeping down the plain ♪

14:02.634 --> 14:04.636
♪ And the waving wheat... ♪

14:09.098 --> 14:10.767
So you have

14:09.098 --> 14:10.767
the money, right?

14:10.809 --> 14:12.477
Yes. It cost me

14:10.809 --> 14:12.477
three Little Lulus

14:12.519 --> 14:13.894
and a Captain

14:12.519 --> 14:13.894
Picard plate.

14:13.936 --> 14:14.895
I hope you're happy.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.105
I'll go get the computer.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.856
You memorize this script.

14:19.818 --> 14:22.987
Reese, that's a great idea

14:19.818 --> 14:22.987
you're probably having

14:23.029 --> 14:23.904
to help that lady

14:23.946 --> 14:25.072
who's trying to buy something.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.658
Yeah, okay.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.785
Can I help you?

14:28.827 --> 14:30.495
How much for the vacuum?

14:30.537 --> 14:33.122
That's a set. You can only

14:30.537 --> 14:33.122
buy that if you buy the lamp.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.624
But I don't need a lamp.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.459
Then you don't need a vacuum.

14:38.336 --> 14:39.713
She'll be back.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.922
And the lamp isn't going

14:39.754 --> 14:41.922
without the blender.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.885
You've obviously put a lot

14:41.964 --> 14:45.885
of thought into this.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.304
Where the heck does your father

14:48.346 --> 14:49.806
keep disappearing to?

14:49.848 --> 14:52.809
And then the stop sign army

14:49.848 --> 14:52.809
spring into action,

14:52.851 --> 14:53.934
all in support

14:53.976 --> 14:57.605
of the military industrial

14:53.976 --> 14:57.605
country club complex.

14:57.647 --> 14:59.940
But that's not where it ends.

14:59.982 --> 15:00.941
(feedback squeals)

14:59.982 --> 15:00.941
Ooh.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.944
Okay, pay attention to this.

15:03.986 --> 15:06.614
How many sides to a stop sign?

15:06.656 --> 15:08.032
Eight.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.243
That's just a little too close

15:08.074 --> 15:10.243
to the number of judges

15:10.284 --> 15:12.203
on the Supreme Court

15:10.284 --> 15:12.203
for this citizen.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.331
(feedback squeals)

15:15.373 --> 15:17.291
Hang on a second, America.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.795
(gasps)

15:26.008 --> 15:27.635
(gasps)

15:31.180 --> 15:33.057
Thank you very much.

15:33.099 --> 15:34.975
That's  my  piggy bank!

15:35.017 --> 15:36.603
That was in my room!

15:36.644 --> 15:38.479
Relax, dipwad.

15:36.644 --> 15:38.479
I got two bucks for it.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.981
It had $16 in it!

15:41.023 --> 15:42.149
Wah-wah.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.943
Spilt milk.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.987
Mom, stupid Reese just did

15:47.029 --> 15:48.489
the stupidest thing to my...

15:48.531 --> 15:49.699
You're as bad as Malcolm.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.910
I don't want to hear any more

15:49.741 --> 15:51.910
complaining out of you

15:51.951 --> 15:53.494
for the rest of the day,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.494
understood?

15:53.536 --> 15:54.995
Now, go! Help your brother.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.247
(scoffs)

15:56.289 --> 15:57.998
Excuse me,

15:58.040 --> 15:59.292
do you have a microwave

15:58.040 --> 15:59.292
for sale?

15:59.333 --> 16:02.336
No, we...

16:04.338 --> 16:05.924
Well, actually, yes.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.007
Yes, we do.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.635
Follow me.

16:09.677 --> 16:10.887
Excuse me, Malcolm,

16:09.677 --> 16:10.887
it's me, Craig.

16:10.929 --> 16:13.013
What's that

16:10.929 --> 16:13.013
you're holding in your hands?

16:13.055 --> 16:16.016
You mean this thing that

16:13.055 --> 16:16.016
I've been trying to save?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.812
That Reese has

16:16.058 --> 16:18.812
insisted all along

16:18.853 --> 16:19.896
was mere junk?

16:19.938 --> 16:21.188
Mere junk?

16:21.230 --> 16:24.024
Why, your brother couldn't

16:21.230 --> 16:24.024
be more wrong,

16:24.066 --> 16:26.110
nor you more right.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.320
Please

16:27.361 --> 16:29.029
allow me to buy it from you

16:29.071 --> 16:30.281
for the princely sum of...

16:30.323 --> 16:31.282
HAL:

16:30.323 --> 16:31.282
Come with me.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.534
Dad, what are you doing?

16:33.576 --> 16:34.577
Craig, get back here!

16:34.619 --> 16:36.245
Mom...

16:34.619 --> 16:36.245
What are you doing

16:34.619 --> 16:36.245
with that?

16:36.287 --> 16:37.497
I ordered you

16:36.287 --> 16:37.497
to throw this away!

16:37.538 --> 16:39.123
Let go of it,

16:37.538 --> 16:39.123
you idiot!

16:39.165 --> 16:41.041
Give it!

16:39.165 --> 16:41.041
No!

16:41.083 --> 16:42.042
There you go-- $16.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.252
Thank you.

16:43.294 --> 16:45.797
Hey, is that stereo for sale?

16:46.464 --> 16:48.048
Make me an offer.

16:48.090 --> 16:50.551
HAL: ...because we believe

16:48.090 --> 16:50.551
in the Constitution!

16:50.593 --> 16:52.303
We don't think

16:50.593 --> 16:52.303
that the Constitution

16:52.345 --> 16:53.513
is an empty promise.

16:53.554 --> 16:55.515
We believe in the Bill

16:53.554 --> 16:55.515
of Rights, don't we?

16:55.556 --> 16:56.850
Well, I never understood

16:56.891 --> 16:58.559
what the big deal was

16:56.891 --> 16:58.559
about quartering soldiers.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.728
I mean, as long as I don't have

16:58.601 --> 17:00.728
to change in front of them.

17:00.770 --> 17:02.856
It's the spirit of free speech!

17:02.897 --> 17:04.440
It's the fundamental

17:04.482 --> 17:06.359
freedom that thousands of men

17:04.482 --> 17:06.359
have given their lives for!

17:06.400 --> 17:07.568
Hang a left here on Riverton.

17:07.610 --> 17:09.904
MAN: Attention, you are

17:07.610 --> 17:09.904
conducting a broadcast

17:09.946 --> 17:12.699
in direct violation

17:09.946 --> 17:12.699
of FCC Rule 27.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.533
Pull over.

17:13.574 --> 17:17.077
I'm not going down

17:13.574 --> 17:17.077
without a fight!

17:17.119 --> 17:18.997
I'm the voice of the little man!

17:19.038 --> 17:20.247
The man on the girder.

17:20.289 --> 17:21.749
The man on the streets.

17:21.791 --> 17:24.168
The man

17:21.791 --> 17:24.168
that fights The Man!

17:24.210 --> 17:25.336
Oh, my God!

17:25.378 --> 17:27.839
You're Kid

17:25.378 --> 17:27.839
Charlemagne.

17:29.423 --> 17:30.800
Give it!

17:29.423 --> 17:30.800
No!

17:30.842 --> 17:31.843
Let go!

17:31.885 --> 17:32.719
Reese, don't,

17:31.885 --> 17:32.719
you stupid jackass.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.136
You don't know

17:32.760 --> 17:34.136
what you're doing!

17:34.178 --> 17:35.596
That is enough out of you!

17:35.638 --> 17:38.182
Are you really

17:35.638 --> 17:38.182
so insecure that you can't stand

17:38.224 --> 17:40.184
anyone else getting

17:38.224 --> 17:40.184
any attention?

17:40.226 --> 17:41.769
Your brother has worked so hard

17:41.811 --> 17:43.604
to make this yard sale

17:41.811 --> 17:43.604
a success,

17:43.646 --> 17:46.273
he doesn't need you

17:43.646 --> 17:46.273
undermining him at ever turn.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.108
Mom, you have

17:46.315 --> 17:48.108
to listen to me.

17:48.150 --> 17:50.277
We have a Nortair 680b.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.362
It's a type of computer

17:51.404 --> 17:52.822
that was built in 1976.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.824
There's only a few

17:52.864 --> 17:54.824
in existence.

17:54.866 --> 17:57.952
And Craig is going

17:54.866 --> 17:57.952
to give us $1,300 for it.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.120
$1,300?

18:00.162 --> 18:02.540
Oh, my God.

18:05.167 --> 18:07.837
What are you doing?!

18:07.879 --> 18:09.129
I have a lot

18:07.879 --> 18:09.129
of things to sell,

18:09.171 --> 18:11.131
and I don't have time

18:09.171 --> 18:11.131
to argue with this bozo.

18:11.173 --> 18:12.174
I've got a Jet Ski

18:12.216 --> 18:14.510
on hold, and the place closes

18:12.216 --> 18:14.510
at 6:00.

18:14.552 --> 18:15.929
What are you

18:14.552 --> 18:15.929
talking about?

18:15.970 --> 18:18.180
I'm buying a jet ski

18:15.970 --> 18:18.180
with my yard sale money.

18:18.222 --> 18:19.515
That money

18:18.222 --> 18:19.515
isn't yours.

18:19.557 --> 18:21.225
It's going to rebuild

18:19.557 --> 18:21.225
our bedroom wall.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.602
But you said

18:21.267 --> 18:22.602
I was in charge.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.228
That means

18:22.643 --> 18:24.228
I  get the money!

18:24.270 --> 18:25.438
No, it doesn't.

18:25.479 --> 18:27.189
Then why the hell would I want

18:25.479 --> 18:27.189
to be in charge?

18:27.231 --> 18:30.150
Reese, this is helping you

18:27.231 --> 18:30.150
become a better person

18:30.192 --> 18:31.652
by building your

18:30.192 --> 18:31.652
self-esteem,

18:31.694 --> 18:33.446
which you are obviously

18:31.694 --> 18:33.446
going to need

18:33.487 --> 18:37.366
if you are stupid enough

18:33.487 --> 18:37.366
to throw away $1,300

18:37.408 --> 18:40.078
that this family

18:37.408 --> 18:40.078
desperately needs!

18:40.119 --> 18:42.246
(tires screech)

18:42.288 --> 18:44.164
I'm cooperating!

18:44.206 --> 18:45.625
I never met this man before.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.167
I hate the Constitution.

18:47.209 --> 18:48.168
I hate free speech.

18:48.210 --> 18:49.169
I'll snitch.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.337
I know things!

18:50.379 --> 18:51.672
What on earth?

18:51.714 --> 18:54.133
Stop! Government agent!

18:55.217 --> 18:56.260
Fare warning, sir!

18:56.302 --> 18:59.722
Running adds an additional

18:56.302 --> 18:59.722
$80 to your fine!

19:01.099 --> 19:02.182
Otto, come out.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.102
I know you're in here.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.185
This is ridiculous.

19:05.227 --> 19:06.646
It's been three days.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.107
Look, I know you don't want

19:06.687 --> 19:09.107
to talk about this,

19:09.148 --> 19:11.651
but you can't

19:09.148 --> 19:11.651
just keep hiding.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.194
Are you happy like this?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.196
Don't I look happy?

19:16.238 --> 19:17.490
(crying)

19:17.531 --> 19:18.783
Gretchen is freaking out.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.701
The guests are leaving

19:18.825 --> 19:20.701
in droves.

19:20.743 --> 19:22.202
And Muffy wants her stall back.

19:22.244 --> 19:23.704
You have to stop this.

19:23.746 --> 19:28.001
There is nothing to stop,

19:23.746 --> 19:28.001
because there's nothing wrong.

19:28.042 --> 19:30.128
Now go away.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.630
Look, if there's one thing

19:30.169 --> 19:32.630
I'm an expert at,

19:32.672 --> 19:34.256
it's pointless family conflict.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.216
And if Rutger is anything

19:34.298 --> 19:36.216
like me,

19:36.258 --> 19:38.136
you're going to have

19:36.258 --> 19:38.136
to make the first move.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.055
That means you're going to have

19:38.177 --> 19:41.055
to deal with your feelings.

19:41.097 --> 19:42.431
I can't.

19:42.473 --> 19:43.641
(cries)

19:43.683 --> 19:44.851
I know you can't.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.936
That's why I want you

19:44.892 --> 19:46.936
to do something for me.

19:46.978 --> 19:47.854
Hmm?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.229
Look at your wedding ring.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.230
Hmm?

19:52.274 --> 19:53.233
Oh.

19:53.275 --> 19:55.319
Schlupi?

19:55.361 --> 19:57.488
Yes, Schlupi.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.199
I think it's about time

19:57.530 --> 20:00.199
he weighed in on all this.

20:03.995 --> 20:06.288
I guess I was a little

20:03.995 --> 20:06.288
disappointed

20:06.330 --> 20:10.250
when Rutger wouldn't come.

20:10.292 --> 20:11.127
And then

20:11.169 --> 20:12.336
when the letters came,

20:12.378 --> 20:13.671
it was so painful.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.839
I couldn't bear it.

20:14.881 --> 20:18.926
I love him so

20:14.881 --> 20:18.926
much, Francis.

20:18.968 --> 20:22.138
And I swore that I would never

20:18.968 --> 20:22.138
do that to my son,

20:22.180 --> 20:23.430
and now look!

20:23.472 --> 20:25.058
(crying)

20:25.099 --> 20:27.685
Rutger is such a wonderful boy.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.269
He's so sensitive.

20:29.311 --> 20:30.688
He's-he's so bright...

20:30.730 --> 20:32.899
I'm going

20:30.730 --> 20:32.899
to get Schlupi a phone.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.986
HAL: (groans)

20:35.234 --> 20:36.986
I'll tell you one thing.

20:37.028 --> 20:39.697
20 years ago, I would

20:37.028 --> 20:39.697
have cleared that fence.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.157
And the open manhole.

20:41.199 --> 20:42.533
Oh, God.

20:42.575 --> 20:45.327
How could I have been so wrong

20:42.575 --> 20:45.327
about Reese?

20:45.369 --> 20:46.954
Hal, just say it again, please.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.288
I really need

20:46.996 --> 20:48.288
to hear it.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.540
Okay, okay.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.542
Reese...

20:51.584 --> 20:54.170
is hopeless.

20:54.212 --> 20:55.213
Thank you.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.297
(phone ringing)

20:57.339 --> 20:58.298
Ah, sorry.

20:58.340 --> 20:59.299
Hello?

20:59.341 --> 21:00.968
Mom?

20:59.341 --> 21:00.968
Francis?

21:01.010 --> 21:02.678
Listen, I've been doing

21:01.010 --> 21:02.678
some thinking,

21:02.720 --> 21:04.180
and I just wanted to tell you

21:04.222 --> 21:06.515
that even though

21:04.222 --> 21:06.515
we haven't always gotten along,

21:06.557 --> 21:08.226
I guess you thought

21:06.557 --> 21:08.226
you were doing

21:08.267 --> 21:11.938
what was best for me, and...

21:08.267 --> 21:11.938
well, I appreciate it.

21:11.979 --> 21:12.813
Wow.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.398
Francis, what brought this on?

21:14.440 --> 21:15.566
I don't know.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.777
I guess

21:15.608 --> 21:17.777
I just had a breakthrough.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.319
Anyway, I wanted to tell you

21:17.818 --> 21:19.319
about this thing

21:19.361 --> 21:20.821
that happened in junior high...
