00:22.522 --> 00:25.066
<i> My name is Asha Maurya.</i>

00:25.984 --> 00:28.903
<i>And I have a joyous appetite for life.</i>

00:30.947 --> 00:31.781
<i>I'm patient.</i>

00:32.949 --> 00:34.409
<i>Resourceful.</i>

00:35.493 --> 00:37.537
<i>And I’m a natural in the kitchen.</i>

00:40.165 --> 00:44.252
<i>Motherly at heart,</i>
<i>I yearn to have a family to feed.</i>

00:45.045 --> 00:47.005
<i>An economist by day,</i>

00:48.965 --> 00:52.010
<i>I live a quiet, traditional life by night.</i>

00:53.678 --> 00:56.222
<i>My hobbies include fine dining</i>

00:56.306 --> 00:58.224
<i>and relaxing at home.</i>

00:58.725 --> 01:00.643
<i>A natural-born athlete,</i>

01:01.144 --> 01:03.271
<i>with boundless energy.</i>

01:05.106 --> 01:07.817
<i>I'm seeking my Indian Prince Charming…</i>

01:08.568 --> 01:12.864
…with a professional job and MBA.

01:13.990 --> 01:16.659
<i>At heart, I'm just a simple girl</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:19.496
<i>who loves weddings.</i>

01:24.334 --> 01:28.505
<i>And I dream of having</i>
<i>a grand one of my own someday.</i>

01:32.801 --> 01:33.676
Don't do it.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.898
-Look alive. Meeting's in 20.
-Huh?

01:49.317 --> 01:52.153
“Singapore equals economic miracle.”

01:52.737 --> 01:53.571
Brilliant.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.198
Please tell me you've slept.

01:55.281 --> 01:59.119
Oh. Yeah, I slept. I slept for 56 minutes.

01:59.202 --> 02:02.539
Asha, stop killing yourself.
This is what you've been waiting for.

02:02.622 --> 02:03.540
It's all on you.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.959
Now, get it together
and prove to my boss in London

02:06.042 --> 02:08.419
that I'm a genius
for stealing you from Wall St.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.671
Yes.

02:09.754 --> 02:11.548
-They're early!

02:11.631 --> 02:14.467
They just entered the building.
That's what you're wearing?

02:14.551 --> 02:17.303
I had a family thing last night.
Black or navy?

02:17.929 --> 02:19.848
-Black, definitely black.
-Mm-hmm.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.641
-Or maybe the navy?
-Tina!

02:22.851 --> 02:24.144
Some privacy, please?

02:28.439 --> 02:31.359
Singapore is a place
where economic miracles happen.

02:31.442 --> 02:35.405
And today, you have the opportunity
to help spread that miracle.

02:36.072 --> 02:40.618
Your investment is key to establishing
our Southeast Asia loan initiative.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.997
Which would launch Singapore as a powder…

02:45.373 --> 02:46.749
…ful, powerful…

02:48.626 --> 02:49.460
Powder…

02:51.588 --> 02:52.672
Pow… Powerful--

02:52.755 --> 02:53.965
Is something wrong here?

02:54.048 --> 02:55.592
No, of course not.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.343
Uh, definitely not. Definitely not.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.012
Um…

03:00.263 --> 03:01.097
The…

03:01.723 --> 03:02.807
Uh…

03:02.891 --> 03:07.520
This is your chance
to establish Singapore as a center--

03:07.604 --> 03:09.063
Okay, let's get to it.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.692
Micro loans aren't a cure for poverty.
It's one piece of a puzzle.

03:12.775 --> 03:16.154
Why Asia and why now? What's the strategy?

03:16.237 --> 03:20.533
Oh, well, we have 140 million borrowers,
80% women, 65% rural.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.995
Our annual growth is 12%
with a projected portfolio yield of--

03:24.078 --> 03:26.539
-Your numbers are impressive.
-Thank you.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.875
But what's the heart of your story?

03:30.460 --> 03:31.336
Heart?

03:34.589 --> 03:35.506
Uh…

03:35.590 --> 03:37.383
We believe that women

03:38.176 --> 03:43.056
are key to social change by creating
a more sustainable future--

03:43.139 --> 03:46.851
Ms. Maurya, we believe
in your fund's potential to do good.

03:47.727 --> 03:50.563
But right now,
we're just not seeing your vision.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.899
I mean, the vision is…

03:53.900 --> 03:56.069
-It's clear in the next slide.
-It's okay, Asha.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.988
If you could give me one more…

04:01.366 --> 04:02.367
That went well.

04:03.701 --> 04:04.619
I think.

04:04.702 --> 04:07.330
I can't believe my mom sent a guy to work
today of all days.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.124
Don’t blame Mommy.
We’ve all botched pitches like that.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.126
Shake it off, move on.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.963
I can see why you’re upset.
This is all lies.

04:15.046 --> 04:18.341
You're not a natural in the kitchen.
You're certainly not a simple girl.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.634
Can you take that down?

04:19.717 --> 04:21.636
I can't
because she's changed the password.

04:21.719 --> 04:23.429
Oh my God, this is a nightmare.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.600
I think he's got
a kind of hot accountant vibe.

04:28.226 --> 04:30.520
Like he could do times tables in his head.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.232
-Are we still going out for coffee or…

04:34.315 --> 04:35.817
Look, I'm sorry, um…

04:36.317 --> 04:39.320
But this is my mother's fault. So…

04:40.238 --> 04:42.156
Yeah. Mine too.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.700
-Handle him.
-Yep.

04:44.993 --> 04:45.827
Sir.

04:46.661 --> 04:47.495
Just…

04:48.413 --> 04:50.164
This is for you. Call me.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.959
Please tell me
you can get me another shot.

04:53.543 --> 04:54.377
I'll try.

04:54.877 --> 04:57.463
And if I succeed, you'll have to show them

04:57.547 --> 05:00.633
why Asha Maurya cares
about this so damn much.

05:00.717 --> 05:03.052
We're not bankers. We're beggars.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.348
If we can't tell a good story,
our little tin cups remain empty.

05:08.474 --> 05:09.809
You ruined my pitch.

05:09.892 --> 05:12.562
Give me a heart attack
while you die alone in a gutter?

05:12.645 --> 05:15.940
Mom, you can't send a DesiDream date
to somebody's place of employment.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.402
Employment? This job doesn't pay
Asha enough to buy a condo.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.863
-Condos are a sound investment.
-I don't want one.

05:21.946 --> 05:24.907
You should've never left banking.
Your whole future was secure!

05:24.991 --> 05:27.035
-I got it.
-Oh, here we go again.

05:27.118 --> 05:30.997
Suneeta, don't make enemies
with a crocodile that shares your waters.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.208
You know, that is so true, Mr. M.
About crocodiles.

05:34.792 --> 05:37.128
You're an economist, Vijay,
not a greeting card writer.

05:37.211 --> 05:40.089
I'm just sharing wisdom of their <i>dada-ji.</i>

05:40.173 --> 05:42.008
Nick, that's Priya's grandfather.

05:42.675 --> 05:44.302
Did she tell you about his boat?

05:44.385 --> 05:46.054
-Please, Dad. No.
-Boat? No.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.847
-I love boats.
-So boring.

05:48.473 --> 05:49.599
Okay, Mom?

05:50.516 --> 05:54.395
All I'm asking is that you take down
this biodata and stop arranging dates.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.939
-Sorry, bio what?
-Biodata.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.943
Like a resume, except your mom writes it.
Instead of getting a job, you get married.

06:01.027 --> 06:06.240
No, no, no, no. This is not biodata.
This is a modern online profile.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.535
A nice way to meet a nice boy like this.

06:09.619 --> 06:12.538
-Meet Ravishanka Shah.
-Suneeta.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.166
Youngest Indian to win
the National Spelling Bee.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.794
-Mom.
-Went to MIT at 16.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.753
-Mom.
-Look, look!

06:18.836 --> 06:22.757
"Hello, I'm a very good boy.
I studied at MIT. I run a successful--"

06:22.840 --> 06:23.674
Mom!

06:25.885 --> 06:29.555
This poor boy's ma wrote this.
He has no idea it exists.

06:29.639 --> 06:30.640
Suneeta.

06:31.391 --> 06:34.602
Enjoy your feast.
This arguing is chewing my brains.

06:34.685 --> 06:38.606
Enjoy. This plate is for the husband
who should be here.

06:41.401 --> 06:44.320
I told her not to do this.
Don't get mad at me.

06:44.404 --> 06:48.574
Well, I will be calling you Mom
soon enough.

06:52.286 --> 06:54.705
Oh, this biryani looks so good.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.665
It's just rice.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.583
And we don't really roll our Rs.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.044
-Careful, it's spicy.

07:01.003 --> 07:02.880
-I love sp--
-Oh!

07:03.548 --> 07:04.465
You okay, babe?

07:04.549 --> 07:06.551
Mom, I'm not gonna meet this Ravi guy.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.177
Fine.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.429
Make me a liar.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.723
My God. You already told his mom
I'm gonna meet him, didn't you?

07:12.807 --> 07:15.977
Beta, I can't let you give up
just because of that <i>bekaar</i> Krish.

07:16.060 --> 07:19.313
Krish? This isn't about Krish.
Why does everyone think it is? It's not!

07:19.397 --> 07:22.608
-Calm down.
-I am over it. Why can't you be? God!

07:26.988 --> 07:28.739
Why would you mention Krish?

07:28.823 --> 07:30.783
Well, what am I supposed to do?

07:31.367 --> 07:35.204
Just keep calm and curry on.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.748
-No, stop.
-I don't know why I said that.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.883
Hey. You okay, sis?

07:46.966 --> 07:47.800
Yeah.

07:49.552 --> 07:51.429
Okay, I need you to do me a favor.

07:52.430 --> 07:56.476
You and Mom can't go on like this.
I have too much on my plate.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.270
And I don't want Mom to be miserable
at my wedding.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.731
So you want me to be miserable instead?

08:01.814 --> 08:03.065
It's one date.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.400
It's a lie, Pri.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.320
-You lied about other boyfriends.
-Shh.

08:07.987 --> 08:11.157
-Not in front of them.
-You mean Ganesh and his gods?

08:11.240 --> 08:13.201
-Yeah.
-They already know.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.037
Come on, I was 16.
There was nothing to tell.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.332
Honestly, I don't think
Mom and Dad want to know the truth.

08:19.415 --> 08:22.627
The fact we used to sneak out
to watch R-rated films?

08:22.710 --> 08:25.505
Or the fact that
you and Nick freaking live together?

08:25.588 --> 08:26.422
Shh.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.092
Can you please help me out here?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.178
Be a maverick in three months.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.932
In the meantime,
if you want to be left alone,

08:36.015 --> 08:37.308
go on the date.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.856
Okay, fine.
I'll meet your little MIT genius.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.984
But no more setups
and you have to take down that profile.

08:47.068 --> 08:50.071
Okay, okay, as long as you agree
to go to the weddings also.

08:50.154 --> 08:52.615
-What?
-It's the best place to find a husband.

08:52.698 --> 08:53.824
I thought online was.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.576
That's also best.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.161
Mom, I have a life.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.663
This is your life too.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.040
You see this one?

09:01.123 --> 09:04.544
Sona's father picked us up from
the airport when we moved to this country.

09:04.627 --> 09:07.922
We had nothing. Eight dollars
and the clothes on our backs.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.049
Really? What was in your suitcases?

09:10.132 --> 09:11.884
The clothes that weren't on our backs.

09:12.426 --> 09:13.886
And this one.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.806
Rohit’s mom took care of you
when Priya was born.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.307
That was Kumail's mom.

09:18.391 --> 09:23.187
No. I remember Kumail's mom was having
her gallbladder out. It was Rohit's mom.

09:23.271 --> 09:25.982
Okay, guys,
I… I know that these are your friends--

09:26.065 --> 09:29.569
Not friends, Asha. Family. Community.

09:29.652 --> 09:34.198
To you these are just weddings, but to us
this is a celebration of a life we built.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.449
From eight dollars.

09:35.533 --> 09:39.412
Do you understand that I may not want
a husband or partner in my life?

09:39.495 --> 09:41.664
Oh! No!

09:42.248 --> 09:43.874
-No!
-Suneeta?

09:43.958 --> 09:48.212
Oh, <i>beta.</i> I can't let you give up
on a lifetime of happiness.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.881
<i>Beta,</i> we just want what's best for you.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.593
I know what you're doing.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.802
You always do this.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.597
Fine. I'll go to some weddings.

09:57.680 --> 10:01.434
-Not some. All. Show we're not ashamed.
-Mom.

10:01.517 --> 10:04.312
Look, if you do this,
I'll take down your profile.

10:04.395 --> 10:06.522
-Great.
-But you still have to meet Ravi.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.190
I have a good feeling about him.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.108
-No.
-Please.

10:09.191 --> 10:10.318
-Mom, no!
-Yes.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.611
-Mom! No!
-<i>Chup!</i>

10:12.403 --> 10:13.613
Order up.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.758
Ravishankar Shah?

10:34.342 --> 10:36.427
-Oh. Hi! Um, just--
-Ravi?

10:36.510 --> 10:37.845
Just Ravi.

10:37.928 --> 10:42.683
-Do you mind if we order? I'm starving.
-Sure. Um, nice to meet you.

10:44.101 --> 10:44.977
What'll it be?

10:45.061 --> 10:50.483
Hi. Let me get a double-cheddar burger,
sloppy fries, large, and a water. Thanks.

10:51.150 --> 10:56.030
And he'll have a… What do you have
for “strict vegetarian seeks simple girl"?

10:56.113 --> 10:57.406
Uh…

10:57.490 --> 10:59.283
Not strict, not vegetarian.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.244
I'll have the same.
Just Coke, not water. Thank you.

11:02.328 --> 11:03.788
-That'll be…

11:03.871 --> 11:06.540
Including 6.625 percent tax, 21.40.

11:08.042 --> 11:08.876
Nice.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.003
How'd you do that?

11:11.087 --> 11:13.506
Oh, just a simple girl thing.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.424
Thanks.

11:15.925 --> 11:17.468
-Shall we?
-Mm-hmm.

11:23.140 --> 11:26.769
So, Ravi, can you really spell anything?

11:27.561 --> 11:28.479
Hmm.

11:30.523 --> 11:32.817
A-N-Y-T-H--

11:32.900 --> 11:34.985
-Come on. Very funny.

11:35.069 --> 11:36.696
Spell "logorrhea."

11:36.779 --> 11:38.989
Listen, I don't dance on command. So…

11:39.073 --> 11:41.701
-Make your mom a liar? Spell "logorrhea."
-Seriously?

11:41.784 --> 11:42.660
Mm-hmm.

11:42.743 --> 11:46.914
Oh my God. Okay. Logorrhea.
L-O-G-O-R-R-H-E-A. Logorrhea.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.708
Well done.

11:48.791 --> 11:49.875
-Thank you.
-Definition?

11:49.959 --> 11:52.169
Verbal diarrhea.
Actually a good word for you.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.129
Ah.

11:54.380 --> 11:55.423
Bon appétit.

11:55.506 --> 12:00.010
Your mom forgot to mention your wit.
So subtle and sophisticated.

12:00.094 --> 12:04.306
-Yeah, yours left out a couple things too.
-Okay, fine. Here it goes.

12:04.390 --> 12:08.310
Uh, I blew up my engagement
to Jersey’s most eligible brown bachelor,

12:08.394 --> 12:12.022
alienated my closest friends,
brought shame and calumny on my family.

12:12.106 --> 12:14.817
I’m no longer allowed
on public transport in Woodbridge.

12:14.900 --> 12:16.736
But that was a misunderstanding.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.780
Yeah, I was just gonna say
you're prettier in person.

12:19.864 --> 12:21.157
Did your mom write that too?

12:21.240 --> 12:22.992
No, that was actually all me.

12:25.536 --> 12:26.370
Ravi.

12:28.122 --> 12:28.956
Asha.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.793
Literally, the only reason I agreed
to meet you here

12:32.877 --> 12:35.629
was so my mom would stop
posting my profile online.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.381
So this…

12:37.882 --> 12:38.716
Us…

12:38.799 --> 12:40.092
…is never gonna happen.

12:40.176 --> 12:41.385
Never gonna happen.

12:42.762 --> 12:43.929
How can you be so sure?

12:45.097 --> 12:47.016
Because our parents set this up.

12:47.641 --> 12:48.476
So?

12:49.185 --> 12:50.019
So?

12:51.479 --> 12:55.232
Wow. Okay. Um, how about this?
I just started a new job.

12:55.316 --> 12:58.861
It's consuming my life. I have no time
for anything else, and I'm okay with that.

12:58.944 --> 13:02.156
I just took a break from my job,
which was consuming my life.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.992
I have all the time in the world,
and I'm okay with that.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.370
So you basically, like, don't have a job?

13:08.454 --> 13:09.705
Well, actually, I--

13:09.789 --> 13:12.041
What happened to being the start-up guy?

13:12.124 --> 13:14.710
I made money off a start-up,
but it's not who I am.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.420
I prefer to do what I love.

13:16.504 --> 13:18.506
Most can't afford to make that choice.

13:18.589 --> 13:22.092
See, that's interesting.
Can't afford to or are afraid to?

13:24.553 --> 13:25.805
See? We're doomed.

13:26.722 --> 13:28.265
Okay.

13:28.349 --> 13:30.100
Oh, cheer up. You dodged a bullet.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.060
Mm-hmm.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.603
Anyway, a girl must eat.

13:33.771 --> 13:34.605
Mm.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.649
I'm gonna go.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.485
-Okay.
-Yeah. But, um…

13:40.569 --> 13:43.197
Thank you. This has been interesting.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.448
Mm-hmm.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.410
-Thanks for the burger.
-Anytime.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.620
Bon appétit.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.538
Yeah.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.048
Whoo! Happy birthday, Pops.

14:01.131 --> 14:04.468
So, Mr. Senior Citizen, how does it feel?

14:04.552 --> 14:08.556
Who'd have thought I’d be father to a man
in his 30s who still acts like a child?

14:08.639 --> 14:10.933
Not today, Dinesh. Ravi is here.

14:11.016 --> 14:12.268
I got you this gift.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.436
No, no, no. No presents.

14:14.520 --> 14:17.398
I cannot enjoy my birthday
until my son finds a wife.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.775
He's trying. He went out with Asha.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.486
Ha! And realized
that women want men not boys?

14:22.570 --> 14:23.654
Dinesh.

14:23.737 --> 14:26.156
Dad, you wrote
this misleading profile of me.

14:26.240 --> 14:30.119
Saying, "Looking for a simple girl."
I don't want simple. Simple is boring.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.704
You can't be so choosy.

14:31.787 --> 14:34.164
-Dad, I'm proud of my life.
-Oh, good.

14:34.248 --> 14:38.127
Proud of no job, proud of never dating,
proud of that T-shirt.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.881
You were so brilliant, Ravi. Huh? MIT!

14:41.964 --> 14:43.883
Dinesh, what's past is past.

14:44.842 --> 14:48.053
But now is the time for you
to find a good girl.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.097
-Mom.
-Good, not boring.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.765
There's nothing wrong with boring.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.893
Please, <i>beta.</i> Just try.

14:55.185 --> 14:56.020
For me.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.730
Okay fine, Mom. I'll try.

15:05.654 --> 15:06.947
Look what I found.

15:07.031 --> 15:09.491
Files on your secret love affair
with a British royal?

15:09.575 --> 15:11.285
Those were destroyed.

15:11.368 --> 15:15.372
These are case studies of every microloan
our company has ever funded.

15:15.456 --> 15:19.752
Plus, a 1997 swimsuit edition
of <i>Foxy Gals</i> magazine.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.420
Now, I know this isn't yours.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.048
Don't be so sure. I did go to college.

15:24.673 --> 15:28.177
So folders. Like the 1800s?

15:28.260 --> 15:30.137
More like the last 25 years.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.515
I want you to analyze these
and learn what we do,

15:33.599 --> 15:35.643
how we do it, and why we do it.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.519
-That could take all summer.
-Mm-hmm.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.439
I want you to be so brilliant,
Singapore can't say no.

15:40.522 --> 15:42.149
But they did say no.

15:42.232 --> 15:46.070
I spoke to the higher-ups in London
and a personal friend.

15:46.153 --> 15:49.365
They'll see if they can pull strings
to bring them back.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.700
-If you screw up this time…
-Heads will roll.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.202
That's a bit medieval.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.287
But yes, your head and mine.

15:56.330 --> 16:00.209
I'll also probably lose my job.
I'll have to take my kid out of preschool.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.670
-There goes Princeton!
-Ambitious, this one.

16:02.753 --> 16:03.671
Come, come.

16:04.171 --> 16:07.299
-Mom, I'm at work.
-Oh, no. Don't "I'm at work" me.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.801
Now what did I do?

16:08.884 --> 16:11.136
-You behaved like a total fool!
-What?

16:11.220 --> 16:14.348
Pooja Patel told me
you gave Ravi Shah diarrhea!

16:14.431 --> 16:16.767
What? No! I asked him to spell logorrhea.

16:17.434 --> 16:19.728
-What's that?
-Verbal diarrhea.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.855
You mean diarrhea from the mo…

16:22.606 --> 16:27.403
Oh. Well, you better behave
at the next wedding or our deal is off!

16:30.155 --> 16:32.992
Today,
our bride and groom come together

16:33.075 --> 16:36.245
to celebrate both the Hindu
and Jewish traditions,

16:37.037 --> 16:39.373
to learn the best of what
each has to offer,

16:39.456 --> 16:42.876
confirming that love,
spoken of in all religions,

16:42.960 --> 16:44.586
is our true meeting place.

16:45.504 --> 16:50.718
It is their promise to be honest, open,
loyal, and devoted to one another.

16:50.801 --> 16:55.347
This responsibility speaks of faith
and the love and support of your friends.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.100
Mazel tov!

17:18.954 --> 17:20.998
I lost Nick to the uncles.

17:21.081 --> 17:23.000
Better than the bridesmaids.

17:24.001 --> 17:26.545
Beats getting hit on
by that spelling bee nerd.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.757
"Hi, I'm Ravi. I went to MIT.
Wanna play Bananagrams with me?"

17:29.840 --> 17:32.676
"No, thanks, Mr. Nerd.
I'd rather clean a shower drain."

17:34.428 --> 17:36.013
Ah.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.222
-You're the nerd.
-Mm-hmm.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.600
Yeah. I'm a nerd.
I'm a nerd. I love nerds.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.269
SAT scores through the roof!

17:42.352 --> 17:43.479
Okay, I'm gonna go.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.564
-Good save, though. Smooth.
-Yeah. Yep.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.275
You look thirsty.

17:48.358 --> 17:49.985
Uh, I was actually just leaving.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.528
Oh, you're leaving this time?

17:52.071 --> 17:55.157
-Why tell Pooja Patel about our date?
-Pooja who?

17:55.240 --> 17:58.368
Pooja Patel,
the gossip queen of Little India?

17:59.203 --> 18:01.789
I didn't tell anyone.
Why would I tell someone?

18:01.872 --> 18:04.124
Huh. She was spying on us.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.085
Unbelievable.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.213
Asha, darling.

18:09.713 --> 18:12.049
Ravi. Did you call my niece Twinkle?

18:12.132 --> 18:14.676
She's Miss India,
New Jersey, you know.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.679
-Nah, Pinky Au--
-She's no brain like you, huh?

18:17.763 --> 18:20.891
But a spelling bee is no Nobel Prize.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.520
Pinky, leave Ravi.
Ravi has time. But Asha.

18:24.603 --> 18:27.314
Suneeta must be desperate.

18:27.397 --> 18:32.611
All these doctors and lawyers and PhDs,
they will be snapped up in no time.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.197
And you will be stuck with leftovers.

18:35.906 --> 18:39.868
Think of the shame! Krish getting married
to a younger woman so soon.

18:39.952 --> 18:45.040
-Oh my God. You didn't know.<i> Bechari.</i>
<i>-Bechari, </i>Asha,<i> beti. Arre.</i>

18:45.124 --> 18:46.500
You know, really, I'm fine.

18:46.583 --> 18:47.793
No. You know what?

18:47.876 --> 18:51.171
Best thing, you get your revenge
and get engaged quickly.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.340
Oh, I'm not looking for revenge.

18:53.423 --> 18:56.343
I'm looking for a bit of time
to focus on my career.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.721
Darling, careers fade away,
but a husband and a family?

18:59.805 --> 19:01.306
Those are forever, darling.

19:01.390 --> 19:03.350
They're handing out wedding favors
if you wanna…

19:03.433 --> 19:05.060
<i>Beta, </i>don't worry.

19:05.144 --> 19:09.565
We promise not to give up on you
until we know that you're happy.

19:10.732 --> 19:11.567
Happy.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.110
-A hundred percent.
-Yes.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.196
But… can't you see?

19:16.280 --> 19:17.865
I <i>am</i> happy.

19:17.948 --> 19:21.326
Thrilled, in fact,
'cause I met someone too.

19:22.369 --> 19:24.746
My Indian Prince Charming right here.

19:26.623 --> 19:27.708
You two?

19:27.791 --> 19:29.209
No, no, no.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.879
I heard from Pooja Patel
it was a disaster.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.089
Disaster? Us? No.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.676
We are the opposite of disaster.
We are perfect together.

19:37.759 --> 19:39.887
Aren't we, Rav? Ravi?

19:39.970 --> 19:41.513
-Uh-huh.
-Ravster.

19:41.597 --> 19:46.226
She's the simple girl I always wanted,
you know? Right, Asha? Shh.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.812
Very good.
Good luck to you and your simple girl.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.731
<i>Chalo,</i> Pinky. Let's go.

19:52.816 --> 19:53.775
We'll see.

19:55.027 --> 19:55.861
Seriously?

19:55.944 --> 19:58.530
-They're gone, aren't they?
-Yeah, to spread the news.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.408
Come on, I'll just tell them
we broke up at the next wedding.

20:01.491 --> 20:04.828
Then they'll just keep coming back.
So, yeah, good luck.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.207
-Wait. What if I didn't say that?
-Okay.

20:09.416 --> 20:12.377
Would it be so bad to let people think
we're off the market?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.879
Is this how you're gonna ask me out?

20:13.962 --> 20:16.840
I am not asking you out.
Not for real, anyway.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.927
-I dunno where you're going with this.
-You don't have to do anything!

20:20.010 --> 20:23.013
Just fend off the matchmaking aunties
so I can get some work done.

20:23.096 --> 20:25.766
Mm-hmm. Hmm. What's in it for me?

20:26.433 --> 20:27.768
You get your life back.

20:27.851 --> 20:29.228
I have my life.

20:31.897 --> 20:34.024
Uh, no, you don't.

20:35.025 --> 20:35.901
Come on.

20:38.153 --> 20:40.864
Think about it. How many
Indian weddings are you invited to?

20:40.948 --> 20:42.157
-Sixteen.
-Nineteen.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.993
We go to the ones we're both invited to.
Brings it down to 14.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.788
-How'd you come up with that?
-Math whiz. Don't question the numbers.

20:47.871 --> 20:50.082
Well, Asha, I'm not even agreeing to one.

20:50.165 --> 20:53.043
If we join forces,
we won't have to deal with all of this.

20:53.126 --> 20:55.712
-Some people enjoy this.
-Do you, Ravi?

20:55.796 --> 20:57.965
You wanna lie, tell everyone we're dating.

20:58.048 --> 21:01.009
Not lie, just role-play
until wedding season's over.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.719
I'm offering you a choice.

21:02.803 --> 21:05.389
Summer with me or summer with…

21:05.472 --> 21:06.306
her.

21:06.390 --> 21:07.516
Hi, Pinky Auntie.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.477
Yeah, I'm gonna pass on both.

21:11.812 --> 21:14.314
Fine, I'll pay you. Fifty bucks a wedding.

21:14.398 --> 21:15.774
God. You're kidding me.

21:15.857 --> 21:17.317
-Seventy-five.
-No.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.111
-One hundred, final offer.
-Five hundred.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.321
-What?
-I'm kidding.

21:21.405 --> 21:25.033
Seriously, I'm not interested
in a pretend relationship, okay?

21:25.117 --> 21:26.368
Can we please focus?

21:26.451 --> 21:29.371
Don't be so selfish.
Do this for your parents.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.748
At least until wedding season is over.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.377
<i>He agreed to fake date you?</i>
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

21:35.460 --> 21:36.753
<i>Actually, what's wrong with you?</i>

21:36.837 --> 21:39.089
I'm a genius, that's what's wrong with me.

21:39.172 --> 21:40.632
What you gonna do when mom finds out?

21:40.716 --> 21:43.218
She'll be thrilled.
That's the whole point.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.762
How do half a billion women
wear these things?

21:45.846 --> 21:48.890
Yeah, she'll be thrilled
until she finds out the truth.

21:48.974 --> 21:52.227
Relax. He's an MIT start-up founder.
He's every mom's dream.

21:53.562 --> 21:58.984
And the best part is,
nobody has to be miserable anymore.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.951
Dad, please just let me buy you
a new dishwasher?

22:08.035 --> 22:11.204
That is so typical
of your generation, huh?

22:11.288 --> 22:13.790
Throw money
every time there's a little problem.

22:15.459 --> 22:19.087
You know, Dad, um, you'll be happy
to hear this, actually, um…

22:19.880 --> 22:21.798
-I'm gonna see Asha again.
-Oh really?

22:21.882 --> 22:23.050
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.009
She agreed?

22:24.092 --> 22:25.844
Yeah, Dad, she agreed.

22:25.927 --> 22:27.637
To go out with you again?

22:27.721 --> 22:28.555
Yes.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.224
Are you sure?

22:31.308 --> 22:32.601
Yeah, Dad, I'm sure.

22:33.435 --> 22:34.895
<i>Bete, </i>listen to me.

22:34.978 --> 22:37.731
Don't let this opportunity pass you by.
Act quickly.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.191
Okay Dad, we just met.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.902
Sure. But now is the time
to make your move.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.613
Before she finds out what
we've been up to.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.782
Okay.
Listen Dad, I'm running late.

22:46.865 --> 22:47.699
Yeah.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.118
Please don't hurt your back, okay?

22:50.911 --> 22:53.497
Ravi, remember what your mother said.

22:54.706 --> 22:57.376
The past is the past.
There's no need to bring it up.

22:58.543 --> 22:59.503
Shh.

23:00.879 --> 23:01.880
Bye, Dad.

23:01.963 --> 23:04.424
Veena, he's got another date!

23:17.729 --> 23:19.106
Hey, I have singles.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.691
Asha's happiness is worth more
than one dollar.

23:23.360 --> 23:24.486
So is mine.

23:29.032 --> 23:31.701
Suneeta, you're quite the matchmaker, huh?

23:31.785 --> 23:35.997
Yes. Asha and Ravi made quite
the cute couple at Sona's wedding.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.375
-Really?
-The spelling bee guy?

23:38.458 --> 23:40.585
You could even say, unbelievable.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.505
What is so unbelievable about that?

23:43.588 --> 23:45.799
Well, go and see for yourself.

23:47.342 --> 23:48.260
<i>Hai raam.</i>

23:49.386 --> 23:51.847
Vijay, very handsome.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.102
-Oh, do you have change for a twenty?
-Sure.

23:58.687 --> 23:59.604
Vijay!

23:59.688 --> 24:01.481
Vijay! Quickly. Quickly!

24:02.774 --> 24:03.859
Look.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.026
-That's him.
-Yeah.

24:06.445 --> 24:08.280
-He's tall.
-He's sitting.

24:08.363 --> 24:09.698
Yeah, but you can tell.

24:11.616 --> 24:13.577
Take a picture. Get your camera.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.374
Some light reading?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.084
Oh. Yeah.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.712
You work in finance, right?

24:23.795 --> 24:25.714
Um, microfinance.

24:25.797 --> 24:27.966
Hmm, that's the tiny kind, right?

24:28.800 --> 24:31.428
That's a bit reductive, but yeah.

24:32.429 --> 24:35.390
I'm trying to create a lending initiative

24:35.474 --> 24:38.393
for women in Southeast Asia
so they can start their own businesses.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.146
Wow, okay. That is impressive.

24:41.771 --> 24:42.606
Thank you.

24:47.694 --> 24:52.115
Maybe read a couple of those and
if we find time, do a lap around the room.

24:52.199 --> 24:55.243
You know, say hi to the deities.
Keep up appearances and stuff.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.205
-Maybe in a little while.
-Okay.

25:02.584 --> 25:04.544
Or we could give tips
to your brother-in-law

25:04.628 --> 25:05.879
on how to pray, 'cause…

25:06.463 --> 25:07.797
What is he doing?

25:14.095 --> 25:17.307
-You think he's gonna down dog?
-It's very possible.

25:17.891 --> 25:18.934
Oh, Nick.

25:19.017 --> 25:22.145
It was endearing in the beginning.
But now it's just…

25:23.313 --> 25:27.275
Yeah, I wish he'd be himself.
The low-key guy I fell in love with.

25:27.943 --> 25:29.486
Nick's still that guy.

25:30.195 --> 25:33.907
Weddings make people crazy.
I would know, okay?

25:33.990 --> 25:36.618
Just talk to him. Come here, sit down.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.166
This is for you.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.044
Nani gave it to me when I got engaged.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.714
Oh my God.

25:50.674 --> 25:51.591
Asha, are you sure?

25:51.675 --> 25:52.551
Yes.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.135
Of course.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.726
You gonna try it on?

26:02.227 --> 26:03.937
-Whoa!

26:04.479 --> 26:06.064
You guys want some hot samosas?

26:08.108 --> 26:10.443
Asha, Yoshi. Yoshi, Asha.

26:10.527 --> 26:11.361
Hey.

26:11.444 --> 26:14.072
-Yo, that's your fake girlfriend? Dude!
-Shut up.

26:14.155 --> 26:15.824
-Sorry! What?
-And her sister, Priya.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.200
-Priya. Hi.
-I'm engaged.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.703
-Doesn't change it.
-What's with the van?

26:19.786 --> 26:24.416
-I'm just helping Ravi out with stuff.
-Just deliveries. Actually, we gotta go.

26:24.499 --> 26:28.044
Yeah. A busboy got stuck in a walk-in.
We have to go save him.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.714
-Okay.
-We just stopped to say hi.

26:30.797 --> 26:32.716
-See you at the wedding, yeah?
-Yeah.

26:32.799 --> 26:33.758
Nice seeing you.

26:33.842 --> 26:34.676
Bye.

26:39.806 --> 26:42.517
I… thought he had a start-up.

26:44.144 --> 26:46.271
Maybe they're still… starting up.

26:46.896 --> 26:47.856
Mm.

27:46.831 --> 27:47.874
Ravi!

27:47.957 --> 27:48.875
Sorry I'm late.

27:48.958 --> 27:53.380
Okay, save it. Some auntie thought
I was single and put me on coconut duty.

27:53.922 --> 27:57.550
-Aunties. He's with me. We're a couple.

27:58.259 --> 28:00.011
And here's the thing, Asha.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.473
Like, I don't like weddings either.
But if you say you're gonna go,

28:03.556 --> 28:05.642
I mean, you go.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.268
Okay, understood.

28:08.144 --> 28:10.772
Look, I'll finish coconut duty.

28:12.607 --> 28:13.942
What is coconut duty?

28:15.610 --> 28:16.820
All right, give me that.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.947
-Do you need a peeler?
-No, you don't.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.290
Thank you all so much for coming.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.794
It's been so, so beautiful
to spend the day with you.

28:32.877 --> 28:36.131
Today isn't about being Hindu or Muslim.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.883
It's about being in love.

28:38.967 --> 28:42.846
A love that in the past
would have been impossible.

28:42.929 --> 28:44.347
A love that our…

28:46.349 --> 28:49.436
…our parents don't support.

28:49.519 --> 28:51.020
But we still love them.

28:52.230 --> 28:56.067
Lakshmi, you're the love of my life.

28:56.609 --> 28:59.279
Today, tomorrow, always.

29:13.835 --> 29:14.669
Are you okay?

29:15.795 --> 29:16.629
Yeah.

29:17.881 --> 29:20.425
I can't believe
their parents didn't turn up.

29:20.508 --> 29:24.053
Well. Your parents, happiness.
Your parents, happiness.

29:24.804 --> 29:27.140
-Shouldn't have to be a choice.
-That's true.

29:28.975 --> 29:33.229
-How's your pitch going?
-It's going. Kind of.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.647
Kind of?

29:34.731 --> 29:38.485
Yeah. Sometimes I feel like
I shouldn't have left banking.

29:38.985 --> 29:42.113
Come on. You're saving the world, right?
One tiny step at a time.

29:42.197 --> 29:45.992
No one said it'd be easy.
Besides, there's always second chances.

29:46.075 --> 29:47.202
Not always.

29:47.285 --> 29:50.038
Always. I mean, look at them, right?

29:51.539 --> 29:54.167
They broke up 'cause their parents
didn't want them together, but…

29:54.250 --> 29:57.212
-There they are, just going for it.
-Hm.

30:01.800 --> 30:02.967
You know what?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.177
Let's go dance.

30:04.260 --> 30:07.138
-Really?
-Yeah. We may never get a second chance.

30:07.722 --> 30:09.307
All right. Come on.

30:15.647 --> 30:17.774
-Wanna go sizzle?
-Let's go sizzle.

30:26.908 --> 30:27.992
I found it, over.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.161
On my way, over.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.249
Oh, wait. Did you find any pics
of Dad's Members Only phase?

30:34.332 --> 30:38.419
It ain't a phase if he still wears it.
But I did find one with perms, over.

30:38.503 --> 30:40.255
-Ooh!
-Check it out.

30:41.256 --> 30:44.342
Ha! That is definitely going
in the slideshow.

30:44.425 --> 30:45.593
Okay. Look at this.

30:49.305 --> 30:50.598
That doesn't look fun.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.601
Well, they only knew each other,
like, three weeks.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.478
She must have been so scared.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.523
Have you talked to Nick yet?

31:00.859 --> 31:05.238
Uh. I haven't had the heart.
He's now taking Bollywood dance lessons.

31:05.321 --> 31:10.243
-Thought you didn't want a dance routine.
-I don't. It's way too much pressure.

31:11.202 --> 31:13.246
Okay, Pri, you gotta talk to him.

31:18.459 --> 31:21.170
Do you think Mom
had a boyfriend before Dad?

31:21.671 --> 31:25.466
No. Impossible.
He must be a cousin or something.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.343
Look at your cousin like that?

31:29.095 --> 31:32.599
Yeah, but, I mean,
Mom would never do something like that.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.475
Something like what, huh?

31:35.226 --> 31:37.020
What are you two up to?

31:37.103 --> 31:38.688
Uh, the wedding slideshow.

31:38.771 --> 31:42.901
Oh. Very exciting. Is Ravi coming
for lunch? I'm frying puris.

31:43.610 --> 31:45.236
Oh. Nah.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.072
What nah?
When are you going to let us meet him?

31:48.156 --> 31:49.949
When are you gonna let us meet him?

31:50.783 --> 31:52.285
We're just not there yet.

31:53.286 --> 31:56.331
Marriage is a lifetime of getting there.
Invite him.

31:56.414 --> 31:58.499
Ma, if you push,
you know what's gonna happen.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.752
The way to a man's heart
is through his stomach.

32:00.835 --> 32:03.004
-That is so gross.
-Or an angiogram.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.672
That is also very gross.

32:07.675 --> 32:11.721
You laugh, but it's the hollow,
cynical laugh of the lonely.

32:14.015 --> 32:15.808
That was very harsh.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.519
Yeah, this is gonna blow up
in your face, Ash.

32:18.603 --> 32:20.855
No, it's not. I know what I'm doing.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.317
Well, I know Mom and Dad.
Wait till they get too invested.

32:24.400 --> 32:26.819
It's just not gonna happen. Over and out.

32:29.113 --> 32:33.534
So, Veena, Dinesh.
We may have another wedding in our future.

32:34.369 --> 32:39.040
Pooja Patel heard from Pinky that
they went straight from fizzle to sizzle.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.960
-So let's start planning a date!
-What?

32:42.043 --> 32:43.461
I told you!

32:43.544 --> 32:47.173
Oh, after all these years of hoping,
planning, praying, finally!

32:47.256 --> 32:50.343
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
Pooja is a number one rascal.

32:50.426 --> 32:52.512
I just know my Ravi's happier
than he's ever been.

32:52.595 --> 32:55.056
I told him, "Just meet Asha."

32:55.139 --> 32:57.892
"She's such a good girl.
What's the harm?" Now, see?

32:57.976 --> 33:00.812
They think our way of doing things
is old-fashioned and silly.

33:00.895 --> 33:04.107
Asha says our thinking is stuck
in the India of 40 years ago.

33:04.190 --> 33:07.694
But Asha became an economist
like her old man. That's something.

33:07.777 --> 33:10.113
But she's too idealistic.

33:10.196 --> 33:11.364
I admire you, Dinesh.

33:11.447 --> 33:14.450
Running this restaurant,
putting Ravi through college.

33:14.534 --> 33:15.702
It's no small feat.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.620
I wanted more than this for him.

33:17.704 --> 33:20.248
So tell us more about Ravi's company.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.918
You know these start-ups, huh?
So secretive.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.087
-Who knows what he does.

33:26.170 --> 33:30.425
Say no more. Asha doesn't want to tell us
anything about her new job either.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.844
To our kids
who think their parents know nothing.

33:32.927 --> 33:34.679
What would they do without us, huh?

33:34.762 --> 33:36.264
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

33:36.347 --> 33:38.307
-They'd be penniless.
-And barren.

33:41.060 --> 33:42.562
Okay, listen to this one.

33:43.062 --> 33:47.817
Her alcoholic husband walked out
right after their son was born.

33:47.900 --> 33:52.697
So then we gave her a loan
to open a tea shop.

33:52.780 --> 33:56.242
Her son became the first in her family
to go to high school.

33:56.743 --> 34:00.538
Yeah, you know what this means?
These loans were her lucky break.

34:00.621 --> 34:03.374
Now that's a story to believe in.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.251
What are you all smiley, smiley about?

34:05.334 --> 34:07.628
-The suits are coming back.
-Singapore?

34:08.254 --> 34:09.338
Yes!

34:09.422 --> 34:10.923
-In a few weeks.
-No!

34:13.885 --> 34:15.845
Okay, just… I gotta get to work then.

34:15.928 --> 34:17.972
Exactly. But not here.

34:18.056 --> 34:22.351
One of our big donors is having a soiree
and you're going to be my wingwoman.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.437
That is if you don't have another wedding.

34:24.520 --> 34:28.441
Oh, I did, but I told Ravi
I have a sinus infection, so…

34:28.524 --> 34:32.195
Oh, that's a great plan. Fake being sick
to fake out your fake boyfriend.

34:37.658 --> 34:41.079
Ever thought of getting out
of this racket and going back to London?

34:41.162 --> 34:43.206
I hadn't until recently.

34:43.289 --> 34:46.042
The head
of our Southeast Asia division just quit.

34:46.125 --> 34:49.587
-Couldn't handle the poverty.
-Would you take that job?

34:49.670 --> 34:51.255
In a New York minute.

34:51.339 --> 34:55.093
But it must be earned, love.
Hence, the return of Singapore.

34:55.718 --> 34:56.928
No pressure there.

34:58.471 --> 35:00.098
Look, I should go back to the office--

35:00.181 --> 35:02.391
-Desert me and you're fired.
-Okay.

35:02.475 --> 35:06.062
Now, come on.
Let's enjoy this bargain drink,

35:06.687 --> 35:11.400
this impossibly hip DJ,
and whatever it is hanging in this room.

35:13.569 --> 35:16.531
Hey, do you think
that DJ would do Priya's wedding?

35:17.031 --> 35:20.243
Maybe you should go check.
And look out for donors on the way.

35:20.952 --> 35:21.994
Copy that.

35:27.625 --> 35:28.543
Uh…

35:29.085 --> 35:29.961
Hi.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.255
Mr. DJ?

35:32.797 --> 35:37.385
Um, I'm sorry to interrupt your set,
and I don't want to cause offense.

35:37.468 --> 35:41.305
But is there any chance
that you do weddings at all?

35:42.056 --> 35:45.476
Uh, actually, someone's booked me solid
on the Indian wedding circuit.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.644
Ravi?

35:49.188 --> 35:50.565
Sinus infection cleared up?

35:50.648 --> 35:52.608
Um, well, NyQuil.

35:53.776 --> 35:56.070
-So you're--
-Spellbound. Am I right?

35:56.154 --> 35:57.989
-Mm-hmm.

35:58.072 --> 36:00.658
-Ravi, this is my boss…
-James?

36:01.450 --> 36:02.535
Yo.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.079
-Yes.

36:05.163 --> 36:08.416
You'd think they'd have nicer cheese
at a fancy gig like this.

36:08.499 --> 36:09.917
That's butter, dude.

36:10.585 --> 36:13.379
How do you both know each other?

36:13.462 --> 36:18.467
I heard him play a few sets at a club
in Ibiza back in my party boy days.

36:18.551 --> 36:19.927
He brought the house down.

36:20.011 --> 36:22.096
-Clearly.

36:22.805 --> 36:23.848
Okay.

36:23.931 --> 36:25.683
Well, I'm gonna go schmooze.

36:25.766 --> 36:27.185
-I'm gonna--
-Not you.

36:27.268 --> 36:28.436
Enjoy the butter.

36:28.519 --> 36:29.395
Thanks, buddy.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.024
You want to grab some air?

36:33.107 --> 36:35.568
Yeah, uh, I could do air.

36:35.651 --> 36:36.694
Air is good.

36:36.777 --> 36:39.071
Keep it chill. No lasers.

36:39.155 --> 36:41.157
-Have a little faith, Rav.
-I have no faith.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.366
Nice to see you, Yoshi.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.952
Nice to see you too.
Is your sister still engaged?

36:45.036 --> 36:46.245
Yes, she is.

36:46.329 --> 36:47.705
All right, cool.

36:48.414 --> 36:50.541
How's everyone doing? All right.

36:50.625 --> 36:53.794
DJ Spellbound's a little busy,
so Yoshi's in the house.

36:55.338 --> 36:58.883
-So, DJ Spellbound, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

36:58.966 --> 37:01.719
-That's not ironic at all.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.681
You know, it started as joke,
but, um, kinda just stuck.

37:05.765 --> 37:06.891
Hmm.

37:12.313 --> 37:17.568
So, um, what's your big secret?
Why don't you have a real boyfriend?

37:20.363 --> 37:22.531
Why don't I have a real boyfriend?

37:22.615 --> 37:24.575
I think it's a legit question here.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.577
Okay, yeah. It is.

37:27.453 --> 37:34.001
After things ended with Krish,
I figured why stop there?

37:34.585 --> 37:35.419
Mm.

37:36.170 --> 37:43.052
So I quit my job, moved to Jersey
in the hope of starting over in many ways.

37:44.679 --> 37:47.974
Of course, my mom thinks
I quit banking just to spite her.

37:48.057 --> 37:49.475
-Did you?
-Probably.

37:52.061 --> 37:56.315
So what about you?
DJ… ing, how did that happen?

37:56.399 --> 38:00.236
You know, my backup skill set is spelling
incredibly esoteric words.

38:00.319 --> 38:02.029
Can't really make a living off that.

38:02.113 --> 38:03.906
-Logorrhea. I mean…
-Logorrhea.

38:05.032 --> 38:09.954
But no, like, when I was a kid,
everything I did was for my parents.

38:10.037 --> 38:14.292
Right? Everything. Except music.
Music was for me.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.544
I mean, music used to make me happy.

38:17.086 --> 38:20.256
But, uh, lately, I don't know. I mean…

38:21.674 --> 38:25.011
I've been on the road for, like,
ten years just working nonstop.

38:25.094 --> 38:27.179
I don't know what I'm working for anymore.

38:27.847 --> 38:28.764
So…

38:29.348 --> 38:34.186
I figured I'd take a break,
just come back home and fix my family.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.149
I'm sorry. It's kind of complicated.

38:48.492 --> 38:49.994
Damn it, Yoshi.

38:50.077 --> 38:52.663
-I'm sorry. I gotta…
-Yeah, you gotta go.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.790
-DJ stuff.
-Yeah, I gotta… Right.

38:55.708 --> 38:56.792
Are we good?

38:57.752 --> 39:01.464
We're good. We're cool. Yeah.

39:01.547 --> 39:02.381
Great.

39:03.466 --> 39:04.467
Yoshi!

39:06.093 --> 39:06.927
Oh, God.

39:09.472 --> 39:11.599
I can't believe he's Spellbound.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.310
Wait, you actually know who he is?

39:14.393 --> 39:17.980
I don't, I'm a nerd,
but he's got like a gazillion followers.

39:18.064 --> 39:19.982
I do not trust DJs.

39:20.066 --> 39:21.776
-Why? What's wrong with DJs?

39:21.859 --> 39:23.986
I'm sure they're talented.
I don't understand what they do,

39:24.070 --> 39:25.154
so don't respect it.

39:25.237 --> 39:27.698
-What's he hiding?
-I don't think he's hiding anything.

39:27.782 --> 39:28.949
It just never came up.

39:29.033 --> 39:34.288
You've been to a bazillion weddings
and never asked him about his background?

39:36.374 --> 39:38.626
I… I didn't want him
to get the wrong idea.

39:38.709 --> 39:41.545
Ash, what if it's not the wrong idea?

39:41.629 --> 39:43.798
Priya, have you been talking to Mom again?

39:43.881 --> 39:45.966
Let it happen. You want it, sis.

39:46.050 --> 39:46.926
-Shh!
-But--

39:47.009 --> 39:48.969
What you want…

39:51.722 --> 39:53.849
is a Mumbai Monster.

39:53.933 --> 39:55.768
A Mumbai Monster.

39:56.268 --> 39:57.103
What is it?

39:57.186 --> 40:02.566
It's a masala mojito infused
with cumin seeds and Kashmiri chilies.

40:02.650 --> 40:03.651
It is…

40:04.860 --> 40:06.028
-Oh.

40:06.112 --> 40:07.363
That good, huh?

40:07.446 --> 40:08.989
Oh my God. That's disgusting.

40:09.073 --> 40:12.034
So what do we know about him?

40:12.618 --> 40:16.414
Okay, he was born in Jersey City
and he graduated MIT 2011.

40:16.497 --> 40:19.708
My pal Joby graduated in 2010.
I can see what I can find out.

40:19.792 --> 40:21.627
No, we're not snooping on Ravi.

40:21.710 --> 40:22.753
It's not snooping.

40:22.837 --> 40:26.090
I'm collecting information
about him without him knowing.

40:26.173 --> 40:30.261
If he is gonna join our family,
we got to find out who he really is.

40:30.344 --> 40:33.264
He's not joining our family, guys, okay?
We're just--

40:33.347 --> 40:35.516
You're just more than fake dating.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.476
You like him, admit it.

40:39.603 --> 40:42.690
So Nick, how's the, um…
How's the Hindi coming along?

40:44.650 --> 40:48.279
The bride is
driving pickles around.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.241
He's very good.

40:55.077 --> 40:57.037
I said, "It's going great." Right?

40:57.121 --> 40:57.955
Pretty much.

40:58.038 --> 41:02.251
Hey, babe. Maybe you don't need
to try so hard to impress Mom and Dad.

41:02.334 --> 41:03.544
Yes, I do. I do.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.338
Nick, you're a neurosurgeon.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.423
Here's the thing.

41:07.506 --> 41:12.761
A binary craniotomy is nothing
compared to planning an Indian wedding.

41:12.845 --> 41:14.763
And I really want this to go well.

41:14.847 --> 41:17.224
My parents were barely married
seven years.

41:17.308 --> 41:23.898
In Indian traditions,
the souls are linked for seven lifetimes.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.986
Wow, that's a long time, babe.

41:29.570 --> 41:31.405
It's not nearly enough, pumpkin.

41:32.907 --> 41:33.741
Okay.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.827
I am starving!

41:36.911 --> 41:40.039
Me too. Who runs out of food
at a wedding? Come on!

41:40.122 --> 41:42.875
There wasn't even
a garlic naan in sight. Whoa!

41:44.084 --> 41:45.753
Holy crap, Ravi.

41:48.130 --> 41:49.882
You live here by yourself?

41:49.965 --> 41:54.261
When I'm not traveling, yeah.
I don't get to spend much time here, so…

41:54.345 --> 41:57.890
It's kind of nice, being at home.
Though I did have fun on the road.

41:57.973 --> 41:59.433
Yeah, I can see that.

41:59.517 --> 42:02.186
Anyway, you didn't finish your story.
So you moved to Jersey…

42:02.269 --> 42:03.145
Mm-hmm.

42:03.229 --> 42:04.230
Now what?

42:04.313 --> 42:07.316
-Now I change the world.

42:08.484 --> 42:13.656
No, but seriously, starting this fund up
has been way harder than I expected.

42:13.739 --> 42:16.659
Yeah. Well, you know,
anything worth doing is hard, right?

42:16.742 --> 42:19.578
I remember when I first started DJing

42:19.662 --> 42:22.456
my parents threatened
to stop paying for MIT. It was scary.

42:22.540 --> 42:23.958
So what did you do?

42:24.041 --> 42:26.085
I knew exactly what to do. I panicked.

42:28.379 --> 42:30.214
Parents, happiness. Happiness, parents.

42:30.297 --> 42:33.342
Yeah. Here's to not letting them
drown that inner voice.

42:33.425 --> 42:34.635
Hmm.

42:38.347 --> 42:40.891
Although, you know
what my inner voice is saying right now?

42:41.850 --> 42:42.851
What?

42:43.352 --> 42:44.770
<i>Yo quiero</i> Taco Bell.

42:44.853 --> 42:47.064
-Oh my God.
-I need Taco Bell.

42:47.147 --> 42:50.359
Okay,
every Indian loves Taco Bell.

42:51.777 --> 42:53.445
-Give me a sec.

42:53.529 --> 42:55.823
-Where are the plates?
-Uh, second cabinet.

42:55.906 --> 42:56.865
Okay.

42:58.742 --> 43:02.121
Yoshi. Um, Good Samaritan needs,
like, 27 number eights.

43:03.205 --> 43:07.418
Yeah. Patesh will meet you out back.
And don't forget the mango pickle.

43:08.210 --> 43:10.379
Yeah, and do not be seen again.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.423
All right.

43:14.174 --> 43:15.134
Sorry.

43:15.217 --> 43:16.468
It's okay. Um…

43:17.595 --> 43:20.347
Yoshi works at your parents' restaurant?

43:21.348 --> 43:24.768
Not exactly. You know,
he just picks up stuff sometimes.

43:24.852 --> 43:28.522
Uh-huh. And then
he sends them to food banks.

43:29.815 --> 43:30.649
Sometimes.

43:32.234 --> 43:33.068
Sometimes.

43:34.153 --> 43:35.195
What's going on?

43:35.946 --> 43:40.034
All right. Uh, I've been making these
huge catering orders from Aroma

43:40.117 --> 43:44.705
and giving them to homeless shelters,
food banks, Little League teams.

43:45.205 --> 43:46.874
Okay, but why through Yoshi?

43:48.709 --> 43:49.668
My dad doesn't know.

43:50.252 --> 43:53.881
You're doing this behind his back.
That just feels wrong.

43:53.964 --> 43:57.176
The restaurant is struggling, you know?
And he's a stubborn man.

43:58.552 --> 43:59.386
Huh.

43:59.511 --> 44:01.096
Yeah, anyway. Let's eat.

44:06.518 --> 44:08.854
-I just have one question for you.
-Hmm?

44:08.937 --> 44:12.107
Would you like some mango pickle
with your quesalupa?

44:13.442 --> 44:14.568
You talking dirty to me?

44:19.448 --> 44:22.034
I am stuffed.

44:22.117 --> 44:24.286
There's another quesalupa
with your name on it.

44:24.370 --> 44:25.663
<i>No mas</i> for me.

44:32.753 --> 44:33.587
Shh.

44:34.546 --> 44:35.381
Listen.

44:37.174 --> 44:38.008
What is it?

44:38.842 --> 44:40.469
The sound of no aunties.

44:41.929 --> 44:42.805
No Yoshi.

44:43.972 --> 44:46.058
-No parents.
-Mm-hmm.

44:46.892 --> 44:48.435
Nobody left to fool.

44:48.519 --> 44:49.353
Huh.

44:51.939 --> 44:55.734
I could be making a big mistake
hanging out with, like, this cool DJ,

44:55.818 --> 44:59.405
who, like, drops beats,
turns tables, scratches things.

44:59.988 --> 45:01.073
Yeah, that's me.

45:01.156 --> 45:03.575
I talk a lot when nervous.
It's called logorrhea.

45:03.659 --> 45:05.160
-You might've heard of it.
-Right.

45:05.244 --> 45:08.455
It's… It's this really long word.
I don't know how to spell it…

45:16.213 --> 45:18.006
Did you just kiss me?

45:19.299 --> 45:20.884
Looked like you could use a kiss.

45:20.968 --> 45:21.885
Hmm.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.099
Are we still role-playing?

45:30.394 --> 45:31.645
We're improvising.

45:38.402 --> 45:39.236
Okay.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.162
And I'm boring you. Wow.

45:48.245 --> 45:49.955
Sorry. It's not you.

45:50.038 --> 45:52.958
-Uh-huh. It's the music, right?
-Mm-mm.

45:53.041 --> 45:54.835
Yeah, better be the music.

45:56.837 --> 46:01.550
-What does a DJ actually do?
-I like to think I make people happy.

46:02.551 --> 46:03.677
Make people happy?

46:04.261 --> 46:07.890
Mm-hmm. I connect with people.
I can feel their energy, you know?

46:07.973 --> 46:08.932
Mm.

46:09.016 --> 46:12.352
I can tell when their moods
are shifting. I can build on it.

46:12.936 --> 46:16.565
Music's just something
that brings people together, you know?

46:16.648 --> 46:21.403
I just love being a part of it.
When I was a kid, I used to feel so lost…

46:23.739 --> 46:24.573
Asha?

46:28.994 --> 46:29.828
Okay.

46:57.189 --> 46:59.191
Oh!

47:00.400 --> 47:01.527
Nice moves.

47:02.486 --> 47:03.570
-Hey!
-Hey.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.239
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

47:05.322 --> 47:06.990
-How are you feeling?
-Great.

47:07.491 --> 47:10.994
-I haven't slept that well in a long time.
-Yeah, I noticed.

47:14.957 --> 47:18.710
Hey, Ravi, about last night. I'm sorry.

47:22.089 --> 47:23.048
You're sorry.

47:23.632 --> 47:25.676
Yeah, that should never have happened.

47:28.095 --> 47:30.138
Right. No, you know,
it's probably my fault.

47:30.222 --> 47:32.641
I should apologize.
I shouldn't have had you here.

47:32.724 --> 47:34.726
-No, Ravi--
-No, I get it. We had a deal.

47:34.810 --> 47:36.061
No, Ravi.

47:36.937 --> 47:39.648
I mean that I'm sorry that I fell asleep.

47:41.400 --> 47:44.152
I wish I hadn't.
I was having a really nice time.

47:45.153 --> 47:46.238
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

47:46.864 --> 47:47.739
Me too.

47:49.491 --> 47:53.871
But maybe we can just keep this
to ourselves for a little while.

47:55.372 --> 47:57.624
You want to fake that we're fake dating?

47:57.708 --> 47:59.501
I don't want things to get weird.

48:00.878 --> 48:03.881
Can we at least agree
we like each other or…

48:04.673 --> 48:05.883
Hmm…

48:06.884 --> 48:07.759
I don't know.

48:14.141 --> 48:16.184
-I'll take that as a yes.
-Mm-hmm.

48:16.977 --> 48:19.354
Though no one can know
we really like each other.

48:19.438 --> 48:20.397
Exactly.

48:22.941 --> 48:24.109
Oh!

48:31.617 --> 48:33.785
-Are you a dancer?
-Used to be.

50:35.157 --> 50:37.659
-I gotta check that. Sorry.
-No, you don't.

50:43.290 --> 50:44.916
-Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
-What?

50:45.000 --> 50:49.296
It's James. Singapore's coming back.
They're gonna be here in nine hours.

50:49.379 --> 50:50.255
On a Sunday?

50:50.338 --> 50:54.301
Yeah. I'm not ready. I dropped the ball.
I have five years of stories left.

50:54.885 --> 50:58.889
Asha, I've seen you
bust your ass all summer

50:58.972 --> 51:02.225
going through these boxes
looking for this story to believe in.

51:02.309 --> 51:05.645
I don't wanna overstep, but I don't think
you'll find that story in a box.

51:06.605 --> 51:07.689
What does that mean?

51:07.773 --> 51:09.900
You're the story. Okay?

51:09.983 --> 51:13.945
For what it's worth, I believe
in that story like I believe in you.

51:14.029 --> 51:15.405
They'll believe in you.

51:17.115 --> 51:18.533
I'm scared, Ravi.

51:19.159 --> 51:20.368
Everybody's scared.

51:21.703 --> 51:23.955
But you've done
the hard work already, right?

51:24.456 --> 51:27.751
Now you just gotta own what you want,
listen to your heart,

51:28.335 --> 51:30.754
and just let your love
be greater than your fear.

51:40.347 --> 51:41.181
Come here.

51:45.477 --> 51:46.478
You got this.

51:53.193 --> 51:55.654
Ready to clean out the bank of Singapore?

51:56.571 --> 51:57.697
Beat you to it.

51:57.781 --> 52:00.033
Excuse me. You're making progress.

52:00.117 --> 52:04.204
Now, get changed,
and let's go knock their Gucci socks off.

52:04.704 --> 52:05.872
I am changed.

52:06.373 --> 52:07.249
Oh.

52:08.500 --> 52:09.543
Right.

52:12.170 --> 52:13.004
You sure?

52:13.088 --> 52:14.089
Sure.

52:17.592 --> 52:18.510
Thank you.

52:24.891 --> 52:26.434
When I was three years old,

52:26.518 --> 52:30.939
I shocked my parents by calculating
a 12% tip on a pizza delivery.

52:31.773 --> 52:33.150
Numbers've never failed me.

52:34.985 --> 52:37.737
But today, I am not here
to talk about numbers.

52:40.490 --> 52:42.117
I'm here to talk about her.

52:43.410 --> 52:46.538
When we gave Chinda a loan
to open her tailor shop,

52:46.621 --> 52:48.165
we gave her a new life.

52:50.000 --> 52:53.712
We also gave her daughters the ability
to become the first in their family

52:53.795 --> 52:55.130
to attend high school.

52:56.131 --> 53:02.262
Like Chinda, my grandfather…
my <i>dada-ji, </i>also received a loan.

53:03.180 --> 53:07.225
When floods destroyed his crops
in the small town called Mirzapur,

53:07.309 --> 53:11.104
he moved to Mumbai and borrowed
1000 rupees to buy this boat.

53:12.689 --> 53:14.774
With the money that he made fishing,

53:14.858 --> 53:19.112
he was able to send my father
to Ohio State to study economics,

53:20.447 --> 53:23.992
making my dad the first
in our family to finish college.

53:26.453 --> 53:29.873
I am standing in this room today
because of this boat

53:29.956 --> 53:33.001
and because of the sacrifices
that my parents made

53:34.002 --> 53:36.671
to make sure
their children had a better life.

53:39.007 --> 53:41.468
Our story is a reminder

53:41.551 --> 53:45.305
that these loans aren't just a chance
to change a woman's life,

53:46.932 --> 53:50.143
but the chance to change her
entire family's future.

53:51.061 --> 53:52.604
Across continents,

53:53.355 --> 53:54.773
for generations to come.

54:01.279 --> 54:02.822
And if we're being honest,

54:03.949 --> 54:06.576
our lives are better
when their lives are better.

54:08.578 --> 54:10.580
Or as my father would say,

54:11.581 --> 54:14.167
"A rising tide lifts all boats."

54:14.251 --> 54:16.211
That's the real story here.

54:19.589 --> 54:25.387
The question is, how many stories
are we willing to rewrite?

54:46.074 --> 54:47.158
Hey.

54:47.242 --> 54:48.201
Hey yourself.

54:50.996 --> 54:51.830
Thank you.

54:55.500 --> 54:57.627
How can you afford to buy
so many of these?

54:58.128 --> 55:02.048
I'm hopelessly addicted to caffeine
and prefer not to drink alone.

55:02.549 --> 55:03.925
Enjoy it while you can.

55:07.178 --> 55:08.054
Wait, what?

55:08.888 --> 55:11.683
Unfortunately, I won't be able
to keep you here.

55:14.436 --> 55:15.520
James, I thought we--

55:15.603 --> 55:20.734
You convinced them to invest
an additional ten million beyond our ask.

55:20.817 --> 55:21.651
What?

55:22.152 --> 55:23.445
Oh my God!

55:24.654 --> 55:25.739
And you're firing me?

55:25.822 --> 55:28.742
Hardly. When I told London the good news,

55:28.825 --> 55:32.746
they decided to offer
the Southeast Asia division to you.

55:33.830 --> 55:35.165
But that's your promotion.

55:35.248 --> 55:37.125
London can wait.

55:37.208 --> 55:40.003
And let's be honest,
I couldn't do half the job you will.

55:40.086 --> 55:41.713
No, no, no. I can't accept that.

55:41.796 --> 55:43.465
You don't have a choice.

55:43.548 --> 55:46.176
Now, not only did Singapore come through,

55:46.259 --> 55:49.637
but we received an additional
massive donation from Red Star

55:49.721 --> 55:51.389
that really got London's attention.

55:51.473 --> 55:53.058
All because of you.

55:53.641 --> 55:56.227
-Red Star?
-Another charitable trust.

55:57.020 --> 55:59.814
Ash, when it rains it pours,

55:59.898 --> 56:02.609
and our little tin cup
runneth over.

56:04.652 --> 56:06.988
-Hmm.

56:08.782 --> 56:10.283
It's beautiful, isn't it?

56:11.618 --> 56:14.371
Yes. It is.

56:15.914 --> 56:17.290
Congratulations, Ash.

56:22.295 --> 56:26.174
Now I have to go figure out
how to spend all this money.

56:27.550 --> 56:28.385
James.

56:31.554 --> 56:32.389
Thank you.

56:35.266 --> 56:36.518
It was just coffee.

56:54.786 --> 56:58.373
Priya! Tea's ready.
And your phone is dinging.

57:04.254 --> 57:07.632
Oh my God. Oh my God.
Oh my God. Oh my God!

57:07.715 --> 57:09.551
Ooh!

57:09.634 --> 57:12.929
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

57:13.012 --> 57:16.683
What else could,
"I have big news to share," mean, hey?

57:16.766 --> 57:18.518
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

57:19.811 --> 57:22.230
Yeah. Okay, okay. Listen, listen.

57:22.313 --> 57:24.858
Why don't you come for Sunday lunch, hmm?

57:24.941 --> 57:26.985
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

57:27.068 --> 57:29.028
Yeah, do wear a sari.

57:29.112 --> 57:31.573
Okay. And I've already arranged <i>mithai.</i>

57:31.656 --> 57:33.741
Okay, okay. All right. Bye-bye.

57:34.993 --> 57:37.495
Oh, yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much.

57:38.288 --> 57:39.330
What's the occasion?

57:40.248 --> 57:42.292
Just the Shahs coming for lunch.

57:42.375 --> 57:44.043
<i>Accha! </i>Things getting serious, huh?

57:44.127 --> 57:44.961
Hmm, yeah.

57:45.044 --> 57:46.337
A word to the wise.

57:46.421 --> 57:49.841
Don't blindly trust
what Ravi's parents say about him.

57:49.924 --> 57:50.925
Fine, <i>theek hai.</i>

57:51.009 --> 57:52.635
<i>Arre, </i>listen.

57:53.344 --> 57:57.432
Just do a background check.
You know, college, job, horoscope--

57:57.515 --> 57:59.976
Ravi graduated from MIT, for God's sake.

58:00.059 --> 58:02.854
-Suneeta, listen.
-And he makes my Asha happy.

58:09.944 --> 58:10.820
Here we go.

58:13.281 --> 58:15.575
Everybody, come.
Line up. We'll do the photo.

58:15.658 --> 58:18.077
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Coming. Coming!

58:18.161 --> 58:19.829
-Come here.
-Come on.

58:19.913 --> 58:21.164
Come, Veena. Okay.

58:21.247 --> 58:24.667
-One, two, three. Say paneer.

58:24.751 --> 58:26.377
Paneer!

58:26.878 --> 58:28.963
I can't wait to see their faces!

58:29.047 --> 58:30.465
-Oh, I hear the door.
-Okay.

58:31.132 --> 58:32.217
Shh, shh.

58:33.635 --> 58:34.636
…getting a pet.

58:35.762 --> 58:38.097
Surpri…

58:38.181 --> 58:39.182
Oh, it's you guys.

58:39.265 --> 58:42.268
Namaste. What's the occasion?
What are we celebrating?

58:42.352 --> 58:43.978
-I'm Nick.
-We're waiting for…

58:44.062 --> 58:46.898
-Oh, I see them coming! Stand over here.
-Okay. Okay.

58:48.233 --> 58:50.443
-Wait, what's going on?

58:50.527 --> 58:51.528
Oh my God.

58:51.611 --> 58:53.321
Surprise!

58:55.198 --> 58:56.616
Look at their faces!

58:56.699 --> 58:57.534
Mom? Dad?

58:57.617 --> 59:02.497
I had no idea that Ravi's parents
were joining us for lunch. Hello.

59:02.580 --> 59:05.959
Oh, your future in-laws
don't need a formal invite.

59:06.042 --> 59:06.876
Sorry, my what?

59:06.960 --> 59:08.711
Your mom is a bit overexcited.

59:08.795 --> 59:10.505
For your news, huh?

59:10.588 --> 59:13.716
We wanted to throw a party,
but this will do for now.

59:13.800 --> 59:16.177
Okay. So tell us your big news!

59:16.886 --> 59:20.265
Oh my God.
No, Mom. That's not what this is.

59:20.348 --> 59:22.141
You're not getting engaged?

59:22.225 --> 59:24.769
What? No. Dad, why would you think that?

59:24.852 --> 59:27.188
You and Asha seem so happy, we thought--

59:27.272 --> 59:29.774
And then maybe my mom got a crazy idea?

59:29.857 --> 59:32.402
Suneeta, I told you
not to let the bull hit you.

59:32.485 --> 59:33.945
Boy, is that true, Mr. M.

59:34.028 --> 59:35.905
Always with the sayings, Vijay!

59:36.406 --> 59:38.491
Okay, then, so what is this big news?

59:38.575 --> 59:42.912
Singapore, Ma!
I got the funding for the loan initiative.

59:42.996 --> 59:45.081
-Oh my God! Congrats!
-Hey!

59:45.164 --> 59:46.457
Thank you.

59:46.541 --> 59:47.959
Is that a promotion?

59:48.042 --> 59:50.253
Yes, actually. And a raise.

59:50.336 --> 59:51.504
-More travel?

59:51.588 --> 59:56.217
You could say that. The position is in
the company headquarters in London, so…

59:59.721 --> 1:00:00.722
London, London?

1:00:00.805 --> 1:00:02.515
Oh no. London, England, babe.

1:00:03.016 --> 1:00:05.810
No. No, no, no, no.
I don't accept this. No.

1:00:05.893 --> 1:00:07.854
When were you gonna tell me?

1:00:08.605 --> 1:00:11.065
Uh, right now.
That's literally what this is.

1:00:14.485 --> 1:00:15.987
Wow, London. That's, um…

1:00:16.070 --> 1:00:18.323
A once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

1:00:18.906 --> 1:00:19.866
Thanks, Dad.

1:00:19.949 --> 1:00:24.746
But look. If you're going to go so far
at least get engaged first.

1:00:24.829 --> 1:00:25.830
-Mom!
-I agree.

1:00:25.913 --> 1:00:28.333
I could check their horoscopes next week.

1:00:28.416 --> 1:00:30.084
No horoscope, none of this nonsense.

1:00:30.168 --> 1:00:33.087
I agree. They care for each other.
That's all that matters.

1:00:33.171 --> 1:00:38.301
Yeah. And Ravi, we know you are a kind,
decent, honest boy. Hmm?

1:00:38.968 --> 1:00:44.057
Okay, Auntie, it's nice that you say that,
but I… I need to tell you something.

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:46.351
-Like, all of you.

1:00:46.434 --> 1:00:48.394
Ravi.

1:00:48.478 --> 1:00:49.687
-Dad?
-Dinesh?

1:00:49.771 --> 1:00:52.023
-Are you okay?
-Get some water.

1:00:52.106 --> 1:00:53.149
Are you okay?

1:00:53.232 --> 1:00:56.861
Ravi, don't say anything.
It's your last chance to be happy!

1:00:57.528 --> 1:00:59.238
-Try to relax.
-Quickly, quickly!

1:00:59.322 --> 1:01:00.156
I'm okay.

1:01:00.239 --> 1:01:02.325
Guys, he's fine. He panicked.

1:01:02.408 --> 1:01:05.453
Relax, Dinesh.
They'll get married in their own time.

1:01:05.536 --> 1:01:07.497
-Dad, stop it.
-Whiskey.

1:01:07.580 --> 1:01:09.791
Okay. Uncle,
that's not the reason he panicked.

1:01:09.874 --> 1:01:13.753
He panicked 'cause I was gonna tell you
that my biodata, it's all lies.

1:01:13.836 --> 1:01:16.255
But who cares? So is mine. Everyone's is.

1:01:16.339 --> 1:01:18.091
Yeah, but Asha, mine is, like--

1:01:18.174 --> 1:01:21.761
Yeah, but you did go to MIT.
You do run your own company.

1:01:21.844 --> 1:01:24.389
Okay, come on, Dad.
Yeah, I went to MIT. Okay.

1:01:24.472 --> 1:01:27.141
I was 16 years old.
I didn't know what I was doing.

1:01:29.769 --> 1:01:31.479
So I dropped out, by the way.

1:01:35.441 --> 1:01:38.361
That must've been very difficult.
When did you go back?

1:01:39.404 --> 1:01:40.947
I didn't go back, Uncle.

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:44.200
I couldn't. I just…

1:01:44.283 --> 1:01:48.329
I needed time to figure out what I wanted,
without all the pressure.

1:01:48.413 --> 1:01:49.497
And that time, it…

1:01:50.790 --> 1:01:51.833
It saved my life.

1:01:54.335 --> 1:01:56.421
So, yeah, I didn't finish college.

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:00.425
But I do have a company.

1:02:01.676 --> 1:02:04.137
It's just not a start-up. I'm a DJ.

1:02:04.220 --> 1:02:06.013
-<i>Hai raam.</i>

1:02:06.431 --> 1:02:07.265
Oh.

1:02:07.348 --> 1:02:09.016
It's okay.

1:02:09.100 --> 1:02:10.852
Why didn't you just tell me?

1:02:11.519 --> 1:02:12.687
Asha, I tried to.

1:02:12.770 --> 1:02:16.107
He should've come clean way sooner,
but it's not a big deal.

1:02:16.190 --> 1:02:18.860
-When we found out, it--
-You and Nick knew about this?

1:02:18.943 --> 1:02:20.319
My buddy Joby told me, yeah.

1:02:20.403 --> 1:02:22.864
You didn't think
it was important to tell me?

1:02:22.947 --> 1:02:24.615
Because we like him.

1:02:25.324 --> 1:02:26.159
Right?

1:02:26.826 --> 1:02:29.287
Oh yeah, no, we like him. Oh yeah, a lot.

1:02:30.288 --> 1:02:33.291
Wait a minute.
Ravi, you had 15 years to make it right?

1:02:33.374 --> 1:02:35.501
Go back to school, get a job, but…

1:02:36.085 --> 1:02:38.379
You become a DJ?

1:02:38.463 --> 1:02:41.215
Ravi, can this lifestyle support a family?

1:02:41.299 --> 1:02:43.259
Dad, don't ask him that.
We're not getting engaged.

1:02:43.342 --> 1:02:44.510
Yeah, Uncle, I can.

1:02:44.594 --> 1:02:46.679
And why are you even responding?

1:02:46.763 --> 1:02:50.224
I don't need anyone to support me.
Why is this always about supporting me?

1:02:50.308 --> 1:02:53.728
Even if I wanted a family,
I could do it on my own.

1:02:54.312 --> 1:02:57.815
All I would really like is some honesty.

1:02:57.899 --> 1:03:01.736
But Asha, wasn't it your idea to pretend
to be a couple in the first place?

1:03:01.819 --> 1:03:03.362
-What?
-Oh my God.

1:03:03.446 --> 1:03:04.614
You lied to us, Asha?

1:03:04.697 --> 1:03:05.990
How could you do this?

1:03:06.073 --> 1:03:07.116
Because of this!

1:03:07.992 --> 1:03:13.122
Because you people drive us insane
with your pressure. This is what happens!

1:03:14.165 --> 1:03:15.458
We are dating now, though.

1:03:15.541 --> 1:03:19.796
What's the point of that? You're a DJ.
How will you pay for your kids' college?

1:03:19.879 --> 1:03:21.672
-Mom…
-Anyone smell the…

1:03:21.756 --> 1:03:23.591
'Cause it smells like burning, so…

1:03:23.674 --> 1:03:27.261
I told you! No one wants to marry
a bum like you. Now do you see?

1:03:27.345 --> 1:03:28.596
Don't call my son a bum!

1:03:28.679 --> 1:03:29.680
You encouraged this!

1:03:29.764 --> 1:03:30.765
Okay, Dad, stop.

1:03:31.265 --> 1:03:35.144
Let me ask you. Who do you think paid for
all the catering orders these last months?

1:03:35.228 --> 1:03:38.231
-What?
-Food banks, homeless shelters, the teams.

1:03:38.314 --> 1:03:42.318
-What are you talking about?
-Red Star Standard, Dad. Ring a bell?

1:03:42.401 --> 1:03:43.820
What about it?

1:03:43.903 --> 1:03:47.406
Those are my initials, Dad.
That's me, I'm Red Star Standard.

1:03:48.199 --> 1:03:49.408
Red Star Standard?

1:03:51.702 --> 1:03:52.537
That's you?

1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:55.373
Yeah. It's this charitable fund I just…

1:03:55.456 --> 1:03:56.499
Oh my God.

1:03:56.999 --> 1:03:58.751
-Asha…

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:02.588
No one panic. The aloo gobi's on fire.

1:04:02.672 --> 1:04:04.382
What? Aloo gobi?

1:04:04.465 --> 1:04:05.967
-Asha, wait.
-Oh my God!

1:04:06.050 --> 1:04:07.802
Did it ever occur to you to ask?

1:04:07.885 --> 1:04:09.262
Why are you so upset?

1:04:09.345 --> 1:04:12.473
Oh. How many more surprises
do you have for me?

1:04:13.266 --> 1:04:14.684
I thought this would make you happy.

1:04:14.767 --> 1:04:18.479
"You have to own what you want and trust
your inner voice?" What the hell?

1:04:18.563 --> 1:04:19.564
I meant it.

1:04:19.647 --> 1:04:21.774
But you don't think
I can do my job on my own.

1:04:21.858 --> 1:04:24.569
Asha, you convinced me
it was a good investment--

1:04:24.652 --> 1:04:28.614
I wasn't trying to convince <i>you.</i>
I needed to do this by myself.

1:04:28.698 --> 1:04:30.032
I just wanted to help.

1:04:30.116 --> 1:04:30.950
Help?

1:04:32.827 --> 1:04:36.289
The way you helped your dad?
Don't you see that it's so patronizing?

1:04:37.331 --> 1:04:39.083
How do you even have so much money?

1:04:39.166 --> 1:04:41.836
Rob a bank? Sell endangered species
off the back of a van.

1:04:41.919 --> 1:04:43.588
No, it's because of Facebook.

1:04:43.671 --> 1:04:45.965
-So you did work at a start-up.
-Not exactly.

1:04:46.048 --> 1:04:48.759
I DJ'd a couple parties for them
back in the day and they couldn't pay.

1:04:48.843 --> 1:04:50.052
Gave me stock instead.

1:04:50.136 --> 1:04:52.597
You made a million bucks
DJing some nerd parties?

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:55.725
A lot more, actually.
Look, it's no big deal.

1:04:55.808 --> 1:04:58.227
It is a big deal. I am not some cause.

1:04:58.311 --> 1:04:59.896
I know that, Asha. I know that.

1:04:59.979 --> 1:05:02.982
At least Krish was honest about the fact
that he didn't believe in me.

1:05:03.065 --> 1:05:05.526
-You did it behind my back.
-Seriously?

1:05:06.903 --> 1:05:09.989
Let me ask. You ever been honest
about a single relationship?

1:05:10.072 --> 1:05:12.283
-Don't turn this around.
-You wanted to role-play.

1:05:12.366 --> 1:05:13.743
Yeah, and you broke character.

1:05:18.122 --> 1:05:20.917
There is a big difference
between telling a white lie

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.835
and being completely untruthful.

1:05:25.421 --> 1:05:26.464
Who even are you?

1:05:27.256 --> 1:05:30.426
Asha, I'm the guy
who went to 14 weddings with you.

1:05:32.261 --> 1:05:35.723
Not because I had to.
Not because my parents forced me to.

1:05:35.806 --> 1:05:38.142
I went because I genuinely wanted to.

1:05:39.477 --> 1:05:41.729
That's the only thing
I was untruthful about.

1:05:41.812 --> 1:05:44.065
That I didn't have to pretend to be
in love with you.

1:05:44.148 --> 1:05:46.150
Which is what I am, by the way.

1:05:48.402 --> 1:05:49.695
I'm in love with you.

1:05:56.243 --> 1:05:58.204
I opened my heart to you, Ravi.

1:06:02.333 --> 1:06:04.043
Do you know what that took?

1:06:09.298 --> 1:06:10.633
And for the record,

1:06:12.009 --> 1:06:13.427
I don't care about MIT.

1:06:17.056 --> 1:06:18.933
I trusted you, and you let me down.

1:06:46.460 --> 1:06:47.545
Hey, Mom.

1:06:48.421 --> 1:06:52.049
I can't believe it, <i>beta.</i> You spent
thousands on orders through Red Star.

1:06:52.550 --> 1:06:55.052
He wouldn't let me help you otherwise, so…

1:06:56.137 --> 1:06:59.557
You were always different,
even as a child.

1:07:01.475 --> 1:07:02.935
And I worried for you.

1:07:04.687 --> 1:07:06.647
Mom, what was the point in lying?

1:07:07.732 --> 1:07:10.568
Asha and her parents
want nothing to do with me now.

1:07:12.194 --> 1:07:13.946
We were only trying to help.

1:07:14.530 --> 1:07:18.617
Do not blame your mom.
You met Asha because of that biodata.

1:07:18.701 --> 1:07:20.119
Can't you see?

1:07:20.619 --> 1:07:24.790
You're our son. We would lie, die,
whatever for your happiness.

1:07:24.874 --> 1:07:26.834
Yeah, Dad, but I <i>was </i>happy.

1:07:26.917 --> 1:07:28.794
Then you should've kept your mouth shut.

1:07:31.672 --> 1:07:32.506
Talk to her.

1:07:33.299 --> 1:07:35.551
-She won't take my calls.
-Then go to her.

1:07:36.260 --> 1:07:37.845
It doesn't matter.

1:07:39.805 --> 1:07:41.724
I came to tell you I'm going back to work.

1:07:42.349 --> 1:07:44.393
Yoshi lined up
a bunch of gigs, and I just…

1:07:45.519 --> 1:07:47.480
-I think it's time.
-Ravi, no.

1:07:47.563 --> 1:07:52.234
Mom, I am done lying.
I'm done pretending to be someone I'm not.

1:07:52.318 --> 1:07:55.196
Again, you're running away
the minute things get hard.

1:07:55.279 --> 1:07:57.948
Okay. Here's the thing, Dad.

1:07:58.449 --> 1:08:00.659
I am not running away.

1:08:01.202 --> 1:08:04.121
Okay? This is my job. This is who I am.

1:08:04.914 --> 1:08:08.793
I just wish you could see that.
I wish that was enough, but clearly not…

1:08:08.876 --> 1:08:10.836
Ravi, it's not that. We want you--

1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:14.799
We want the son we lost when
he dropped out of MIT and disappeared.

1:08:16.133 --> 1:08:19.887
-We want those years back.
-Yeah, but those years are gone, Dad!

1:08:19.970 --> 1:08:21.347
Those years are gone!

1:08:23.641 --> 1:08:28.145
But the son you do have is standing
right in front of you. I am right here.

1:08:33.859 --> 1:08:34.693
Okay.

1:09:52.938 --> 1:09:54.940
I recommend a flat in Shoreditch.

1:09:55.024 --> 1:09:58.611
It's murderously expensive,
but you're getting a raise.

1:10:07.786 --> 1:10:09.663
They called again to see if you'd signed.

1:10:17.004 --> 1:10:20.341
Ash, he's an international DJ.
You'll see him again.

1:10:21.550 --> 1:10:22.635
I don't think so.

1:10:23.219 --> 1:10:25.054
Look. I'm sorry. I'm confused.

1:10:25.846 --> 1:10:29.642
This guy that you pretended to date
and thought was broke,

1:10:29.725 --> 1:10:31.560
you actually fell in love with.

1:10:32.478 --> 1:10:34.897
Okay. And, it turns out,
oh, he's crazy rich.

1:10:35.397 --> 1:10:37.942
Not to mention, he helped you get promoted
over your boss.

1:10:38.025 --> 1:10:39.401
He believes in you.

1:10:39.485 --> 1:10:42.196
And this is the guy
you never wanna see again.

1:10:44.657 --> 1:10:47.826
You need to swallow your pride
you need to sign that contract,

1:10:47.910 --> 1:10:51.330
and then you need to apologize
to that boy. It is that simple.

1:10:51.413 --> 1:10:53.165
-It's not--
-I don't wanna hear it!

1:10:54.583 --> 1:10:55.960
You know what's not simple?

1:10:57.753 --> 1:10:58.587
Seeing you go.

1:11:01.590 --> 1:11:02.800
I'm gonna miss you.

1:11:02.883 --> 1:11:04.218
We're gonna miss you.

1:11:04.301 --> 1:11:08.264
I'm gonna hate your phony British accent
you're obviously gonna come home with.

1:11:10.891 --> 1:11:13.477
But if you let opportunities
like this pass you by…

1:11:16.188 --> 1:11:18.274
-I'm gonna have to kill you.

1:11:18.357 --> 1:11:20.567
I know people in this town
who can make that happen.

1:11:20.651 --> 1:11:23.612
-Okay.
-If it's really over, why not just go?

1:11:23.696 --> 1:11:24.905
What's holding you back?

1:11:26.156 --> 1:11:31.495
I guess my family, my parents, my sister.
I've never left them like this before.

1:11:31.578 --> 1:11:35.291
We spend so much energy
trying to get away from our parents.

1:11:35.374 --> 1:11:37.501
And when we finally get the chance…

1:11:39.670 --> 1:11:42.172
It was hard for me
to leave Jamaica for London.

1:11:43.674 --> 1:11:47.720
I didn't want to abandon my parents.
In spite of our differences.

1:11:48.304 --> 1:11:49.471
And how did you?

1:11:49.555 --> 1:11:53.142
I realized my life is where I take it.

1:11:54.435 --> 1:11:56.770
My parents will always be there for me.

1:11:56.854 --> 1:12:01.108
But opportunities like these
don't come along every day.

1:12:04.737 --> 1:12:07.448
So this is where you're saving the world.

1:12:08.115 --> 1:12:10.326
-Dad?
-We were just leaving.

1:12:15.122 --> 1:12:15.956
Mr. Maurya.

1:12:16.915 --> 1:12:18.459
What are you doing here?

1:12:20.878 --> 1:12:22.546
You want to go for a walk?

1:12:31.555 --> 1:12:37.144
<i>Beta, </i>when I was a young economist,
it was a different time.

1:12:38.312 --> 1:12:41.523
White men half as smart as me
would get promoted above me.

1:12:41.607 --> 1:12:43.859
I'd get stuck doing their job for them.

1:12:44.943 --> 1:12:48.947
You know what my boss said?
He said, "Indians? They're smart, sure,

1:12:49.031 --> 1:12:52.159
but they're numbers guys.
They'll never be leaders."

1:12:52.951 --> 1:12:57.331
I know. Makes me so mad.
I'm sorry you had to go through that, Dad.

1:12:57.414 --> 1:13:01.168
Which is why I was so worried
that you were being too idealistic.

1:13:01.668 --> 1:13:04.713
I didn't want you to face
the same disappointment I had.

1:13:06.590 --> 1:13:08.717
But, um, look at you.

1:13:10.219 --> 1:13:11.387
You did it.

1:13:13.722 --> 1:13:16.016
Bigger numbers than I ever dreamt of.

1:13:17.768 --> 1:13:19.895
And you know what makes me the most proud?

1:13:20.979 --> 1:13:22.981
That you did it on your own terms.

1:13:23.941 --> 1:13:26.902
<i>Jah, beti.</i> Go to London. You deserve it.

1:13:27.444 --> 1:13:30.948
-Go have the experience of a lifetime.

1:13:32.366 --> 1:13:33.575
For me.

1:13:38.205 --> 1:13:40.165
I'm sorry that I lied to you.

1:13:41.458 --> 1:13:42.918
I'm sorry we drove you crazy.

1:13:44.878 --> 1:13:47.131
-I blame it on your mother.

1:13:50.008 --> 1:13:52.344
I think I have time for some ice cream.

1:13:52.845 --> 1:13:54.388
What kind of job is this?

1:14:20.998 --> 1:14:23.542
<i>Offo,</i> where is your sister?

1:14:23.625 --> 1:14:25.294
Getting her makeup done. Relax.

1:14:25.377 --> 1:14:28.380
<i>Hai Bhagwan.</i>
Why is she only wearing one necklace?

1:14:29.339 --> 1:14:31.133
'Cause she's not Mr. T, Ma.

1:14:31.717 --> 1:14:36.013
Well, she's late now. Call and see
what time they left their home.

1:14:36.638 --> 1:14:38.932
Their home? What do you mean "their home"?

1:14:39.016 --> 1:14:43.103
You think I was born yesterday.
I know about the boyfriends.

1:14:43.187 --> 1:14:45.397
The sneaking around at night.

1:14:46.106 --> 1:14:48.400
And the fact that
Nick and Priya live together.

1:14:49.276 --> 1:14:52.863
And yet you didn't say anything.
That is very unlike you.

1:14:52.946 --> 1:14:57.784
I wanted her to tell me. I wanted
my daughters to tell me everything.

1:15:00.579 --> 1:15:04.875
Well, you know, Ma,
that we've always wanted to.

1:15:06.793 --> 1:15:08.003
We just didn't know how.

1:15:09.129 --> 1:15:12.132
We never really speak
about that stuff in our family.

1:15:13.759 --> 1:15:16.970
You never really even told me
about your life before I was born.

1:15:18.013 --> 1:15:21.683
What is there to tell?
I drove my parents crazy, just like you.

1:15:22.309 --> 1:15:24.561
I find that very hard to believe.

1:15:25.854 --> 1:15:29.316
-I also know you found that photo.
-Of you and that boy?

1:15:31.735 --> 1:15:34.905
Parag and I were neighbors.
Our fathers were old friends.

1:15:34.988 --> 1:15:37.366
When Parag would come for tea
with his father,

1:15:37.449 --> 1:15:40.410
we would sit in the garden
and talk for hours.

1:15:40.994 --> 1:15:42.871
Of course, we fell in love.

1:15:44.248 --> 1:15:47.793
When it came time to arrange my marriage,
I told my parents about him,

1:15:48.335 --> 1:15:49.211
but they forbade it.

1:15:49.294 --> 1:15:52.965
He was from a different caste, they said.

1:15:54.466 --> 1:15:57.469
My father never spoke
to Parag's family again.

1:16:00.305 --> 1:16:04.935
My parents arranged a <i>shaadi </i>for me
to your father and my fate was sealed.

1:16:07.187 --> 1:16:08.021
Mom.

1:16:11.817 --> 1:16:13.944
That must have been so heartbreaking.

1:16:14.987 --> 1:16:15.821
It was.

1:16:16.488 --> 1:16:19.741
At first,
I pretended to love your dad.

1:16:19.825 --> 1:16:23.370
But eventually,
I didn't need to pretend anymore.

1:16:25.539 --> 1:16:29.751
And now I have you girls
and this beautiful life.

1:16:34.006 --> 1:16:35.674
Do you ever think about him?

1:16:36.508 --> 1:16:38.677
Oh yeah, from time to time.

1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:42.389
I told myself, if I ever had daughters,
I would let them choose their fate,

1:16:42.472 --> 1:16:43.557
their happiness.

1:16:44.266 --> 1:16:49.730
Yeah, as long as we have five MBAs,
choose a nice guy, and make round rotis.

1:16:49.813 --> 1:16:52.816
-This looks good. You should wear this.
-This isn't <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

1:16:52.899 --> 1:16:56.486
Listen to you, Miss Taco Bell.
When have you even made one roti?

1:16:56.570 --> 1:16:59.114
-I made, like, a quarter once.
-Yeah, once.

1:17:00.324 --> 1:17:04.286
Oh, <i>beta.</i> I hate to see you go to London.

1:17:05.912 --> 1:17:08.206
But that is your fate.

1:17:09.499 --> 1:17:15.756
And darling, I know Ravi's not perfect,
but I feel he's your happiness.

1:17:16.381 --> 1:17:18.258
I see the way he looks at you.

1:17:18.342 --> 1:17:21.386
It's exactly the same way
your father's looked at me

1:17:21.470 --> 1:17:23.013
since the day we met.

1:17:27.309 --> 1:17:29.936
-Why are you sitting around? Priya's gone!
-What?

1:17:30.020 --> 1:17:32.064
She's didn't show up for makeup
and her phone is off.

1:17:32.147 --> 1:17:34.232
She was supposed to do that an hour ago.

1:17:34.316 --> 1:17:37.194
Calm down. She's gotta be here somewhere.
Let's split up.

1:17:37.277 --> 1:17:38.320
Should've had sons.

1:17:38.403 --> 1:17:40.113
Vijay, call 911!

1:17:40.197 --> 1:17:42.491
-I go this way, you that way.
-Yeah, okay.

1:17:42.574 --> 1:17:43.992
-Priya?
-Priya?

1:17:44.534 --> 1:17:46.119
-Ah! Sorry, Aunties.

1:17:47.621 --> 1:17:48.497
Priya!

1:17:49.748 --> 1:17:50.832
-Pri!
-Darling?

1:17:51.333 --> 1:17:54.378
-Sorry! How many bathrooms are there?

1:17:54.461 --> 1:17:56.046
Priya? Priya, <i>beta!</i>

1:17:56.129 --> 1:17:58.715
Don't worry, everything's fine. Priya!

1:18:00.008 --> 1:18:01.134
-Asha.
-Nick?

1:18:01.218 --> 1:18:02.928
-I need help.
-Have you seen Priya?

1:18:03.011 --> 1:18:03.845
-Priya?
-Yes!

1:18:03.929 --> 1:18:07.140
-No. Wait, I need your…
-Priya! Pri?

1:18:08.600 --> 1:18:09.434
Pri?

1:18:11.061 --> 1:18:13.188
-Pri, is that you?
-No.

1:18:13.271 --> 1:18:15.524
-Want to talk about it?
-No!

1:18:15.607 --> 1:18:19.444
Uh, okay, I don't mean to rush you,
but your guests have started to arrive.

1:18:19.528 --> 1:18:20.987
I don't care!

1:18:21.571 --> 1:18:23.323
Come on, open up. It's only me.

1:18:23.407 --> 1:18:24.783
It's fricking open.

1:18:25.534 --> 1:18:27.536
Oh.

1:18:28.328 --> 1:18:30.414
-What is going on here?

1:18:30.497 --> 1:18:33.750
I didn't want the ice sculptures.
I didn't…

1:18:33.834 --> 1:18:38.171
I didn't want the gold-leaf cake,
and why can't he just wear a tuxedo?

1:18:38.255 --> 1:18:41.800
Okay, Dr. Priya, time for a little chat.

1:18:41.883 --> 1:18:44.678
He won't even tell me
what his big surprise is.

1:18:44.761 --> 1:18:47.180
Then it wouldn't be a surprise, would it?

1:18:47.889 --> 1:18:52.519
I don't think this is about cakes
or ice sculptures or surprises.

1:18:52.602 --> 1:18:56.064
-I think this is about you.
-How is this possibly about me?

1:18:56.148 --> 1:18:59.443
For some reason, I think
this whole seven lifetimes thing

1:18:59.526 --> 1:19:00.986
has you kind of freaked out.

1:19:04.698 --> 1:19:06.283
It just got me thinking.

1:19:06.366 --> 1:19:09.745
Every generation in our family
has done this for centuries.

1:19:10.454 --> 1:19:12.664
What if I'm the first one to screw it up?

1:19:13.915 --> 1:19:15.792
You don't have to worry.
I already screwed it up.

1:19:15.876 --> 1:19:18.920
But I'm the first one to marry someone
who isn't Indian.

1:19:19.004 --> 1:19:22.007
Is that what this is about? 'Cause Nick is
way more Indian than we are.

1:19:22.090 --> 1:19:26.344
Are you seriously gonna say that to me?
How's that supposed to make me feel…

1:19:26.428 --> 1:19:28.054
I know. Listen, listen, listen.

1:19:28.972 --> 1:19:32.267
-Nick is crazy about you.

1:19:33.018 --> 1:19:36.605
Okay? I mean, otherwise
he wouldn't be dressed the way he is.

1:19:37.189 --> 1:19:38.982
-How's he dressed?
-Doesn't matter.

1:19:39.065 --> 1:19:41.443
What matters is that he loves you.

1:19:42.903 --> 1:19:44.613
And Mom and Dad love him.

1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.365
Or at least, they will learn to.

1:19:49.409 --> 1:19:52.037
The only question that remains is, do you?

1:19:57.834 --> 1:19:59.503
But I'm scared.

1:20:03.048 --> 1:20:04.549
We're all scared.

1:20:07.427 --> 1:20:09.054
If you don't marry Nick today,

1:20:09.137 --> 1:20:11.890
you're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

1:20:14.768 --> 1:20:18.355
Pri, you have a chance
to live your life the way you want to.

1:20:20.190 --> 1:20:21.900
So just tune out the noise.

1:20:23.109 --> 1:20:24.528
Listen to your heart.

1:20:26.780 --> 1:20:28.949
Let your love be greater than your fear.

1:20:33.495 --> 1:20:35.455
That's beautiful, Ash.

1:20:36.832 --> 1:20:39.334
-Did you come up with that yourself?
-Yep.

1:20:40.627 --> 1:20:41.461
No.

1:20:46.216 --> 1:20:48.260
It was someone
a little bit smarter than me.

1:20:51.012 --> 1:20:53.014
We need to get you into makeup. Now.

1:20:53.098 --> 1:20:55.976
-Really?
-Yes, really. You should see your face.

1:20:56.059 --> 1:20:57.060
God!

1:20:57.143 --> 1:21:00.981
Priya! Thank God!
Quickly, let's get you ready and dressed.

1:21:01.064 --> 1:21:02.566
-Have you been drinking?
-No.

1:21:02.649 --> 1:21:04.234
Yes. Get her some coffee.

1:21:04.317 --> 1:21:06.152
Wait, wait, no. Let's get you dressed.

1:21:06.236 --> 1:21:07.779
There's something I need to do first.

1:21:07.863 --> 1:21:09.781
-Where you going?
-Don't worry, I'll be back.

1:21:09.865 --> 1:21:12.868
<i>Hai raam!</i>
I can smell the Pinot Grigio on you.

1:21:22.752 --> 1:21:25.088
-I know. I was 12 years old.
-Oh my God.

1:21:25.171 --> 1:21:28.633
And so, I'm alone with this person
who's driving me crazy.

1:21:28.717 --> 1:21:31.136
I had to walk home. Can you imagine that?

1:21:32.345 --> 1:21:34.806
-And I decided to keep it.
-Ravi?

1:21:36.182 --> 1:21:40.353
-Asha. What're you doing here?
-I was an idiot. I owe you an apology.

1:21:40.437 --> 1:21:41.605
Asha, you don't have to--

1:21:41.688 --> 1:21:46.693
I never had a chance to thank you.
For going along with my crazy scheme.

1:21:50.113 --> 1:21:54.200
For teaching me how to drop beats
and turn tables.

1:21:56.036 --> 1:21:59.331
For donating 50 years' worth
of Indian takeout to my work.

1:22:02.292 --> 1:22:04.002
I know it came from your heart.

1:22:05.837 --> 1:22:08.048
Because everything you do
comes from your heart.

1:22:12.427 --> 1:22:15.347
And I was wrong to say
you didn't believe in me.

1:22:19.059 --> 1:22:20.143
I'm sorry.

1:22:20.644 --> 1:22:21.478
Ash…

1:22:21.978 --> 1:22:24.606
Um, Ravi, who is this?

1:22:24.689 --> 1:22:25.649
Doesn't matter.

1:22:26.483 --> 1:22:29.319
What matters is this is a great guy,
you know?

1:22:30.028 --> 1:22:32.948
He's brilliant. He's kind.
He's a true original.

1:22:34.074 --> 1:22:36.409
He might seem like
a bit of a slacker at first.

1:22:36.493 --> 1:22:37.994
I thought so too.

1:22:38.745 --> 1:22:42.207
And you should never play him
at Bananagrams. Ever.

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:47.087
As you get to know him, he grows on you.

1:22:48.588 --> 1:22:50.340
And if you're not too blind,

1:22:51.841 --> 1:22:54.803
you'll find he's the kind of guy
you want cheering you on.

1:22:58.181 --> 1:22:59.015
Always.

1:23:00.850 --> 1:23:01.893
Ash.

1:23:02.477 --> 1:23:03.728
-Asha.
-Go.

1:23:03.812 --> 1:23:05.522
-Go!
-Asha!

1:23:07.190 --> 1:23:08.900
It's not what you think!

1:23:08.984 --> 1:23:10.068
Asha. Asha, wait!

1:23:14.823 --> 1:23:17.742
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-Why do you keep saying that?

1:23:17.826 --> 1:23:20.453
Why do you keep telling me to calm down.
This is serious.

1:23:20.537 --> 1:23:21.705
People are listening.

1:23:21.788 --> 1:23:23.623
-Why are we here?
-Thank God you're here.

1:23:23.707 --> 1:23:25.375
Great. Now we need the groom.

1:23:25.458 --> 1:23:26.292
Where's Nick?

1:23:26.376 --> 1:23:28.294
-You haven't seen him?
-No. Why?

1:23:28.378 --> 1:23:29.587
This is a disaster!

1:23:29.671 --> 1:23:31.840
If this is his surprise,
this is not funny.

1:23:31.923 --> 1:23:34.926
This white guy is taking
Indian Standard Time to a new level.

1:23:35.010 --> 1:23:36.803
How could he just disappear?

1:23:36.886 --> 1:23:39.556
-I did see him before and he--
-He what?

1:23:39.639 --> 1:23:40.849
He was asking for help.

1:23:40.932 --> 1:23:42.642
-You didn't help him?
-I was looking for you!

1:23:42.726 --> 1:23:45.478
-God, our daughters will never marry!
-Ma. Come on.

1:24:04.456 --> 1:24:05.999
Is that an elephant?

1:24:06.082 --> 1:24:08.084
-Whoo!

1:24:09.878 --> 1:24:10.920
<i> Hai Bhagwan.</i>

1:24:13.381 --> 1:24:16.384
Oh. My. God.

1:24:30.482 --> 1:24:32.025
Welcome, Spice Girls!

1:24:37.363 --> 1:24:38.281
Priya.

1:24:41.493 --> 1:24:46.081
You are a dead onion.

1:24:47.832 --> 1:24:53.296
With you, I'm a thin banana.

1:24:56.299 --> 1:24:58.843
-Did I… I said…
-No.

1:24:58.927 --> 1:25:00.804
-No?
-No.

1:25:00.887 --> 1:25:03.014
My God, I'm so sorry I was so late.

1:25:05.809 --> 1:25:09.229
I know you didn't want a whole thing,
and I did a whole thing.

1:25:09.312 --> 1:25:10.313
It was perfect.

1:25:10.396 --> 1:25:12.190
I love you so much.

1:25:20.573 --> 1:25:22.408
Come on, let's get you married!

1:25:53.314 --> 1:25:55.900
Congratulations, guys. Whoo!

1:25:57.235 --> 1:26:01.281
And congratulations to my mom and dad too,
for staying out of their way.

1:26:01.364 --> 1:26:02.740
-Mostly.
-Little bit.

1:26:04.033 --> 1:26:07.996
One thing that I have learned about love…

1:26:09.998 --> 1:26:12.750
is that it's a lot
like moving to a new country.

1:26:12.834 --> 1:26:16.713
Trying to build something
where nothing existed before.

1:26:18.381 --> 1:26:22.719
It's hanging on and letting go.

1:26:23.344 --> 1:26:25.722
It's messy, it's beautiful,

1:26:26.723 --> 1:26:28.725
like any giant leap of faith.

1:26:31.102 --> 1:26:35.231
So congratulations to the two of you
for taking that leap.

1:26:35.315 --> 1:26:38.318
May you take many more. I love you.

1:26:41.029 --> 1:26:43.740
-Cheers to Nick and Priya!
-Cheers!

1:26:45.450 --> 1:26:46.284
Cheers.

1:26:46.367 --> 1:26:47.368
Thank you.

1:26:47.452 --> 1:26:48.661
Aw! You're welcome.

1:26:48.745 --> 1:26:49.704
I love you guys.

1:26:49.787 --> 1:26:50.830
Thank you, Ash.

1:26:50.914 --> 1:26:52.040
You could get married too.

1:26:52.123 --> 1:26:53.166
-I love you.
-Mom!

1:26:53.249 --> 1:26:58.671
And thank you to everyone
who celebrated with us today.

1:26:59.547 --> 1:27:01.966
But we have a surprise for you.

1:27:02.050 --> 1:27:03.801
I am honored to invite

1:27:04.719 --> 1:27:08.264
our own DJ Spellbound!

1:27:10.934 --> 1:27:11.851
That's Ravi!

1:27:12.435 --> 1:27:14.145
Look, Asha, that's Ravi.

1:27:20.985 --> 1:27:22.862
You have to say something to them.

1:27:26.950 --> 1:27:29.285
Stop the music! Stop the music!

1:27:31.788 --> 1:27:34.666
What in God's name is going on?
Pinky, please sit down.

1:27:34.749 --> 1:27:38.920
Suneeta, Vijay, it is my duty to tell you
that this boy is a fraud.

1:27:40.255 --> 1:27:42.465
-Pinky, it's okay.
-I tried to warn you.

1:27:42.548 --> 1:27:44.550
No, no, no. Pinky, enough.

1:27:44.634 --> 1:27:45.927
Enough.

1:27:46.010 --> 1:27:48.054
You need to let this go.

1:27:48.137 --> 1:27:52.725
Maybe it's time we learn something
from our kids and leave the shame behind.

1:27:53.601 --> 1:27:56.396
Pinky, it's over. Come.

1:27:57.313 --> 1:27:59.732
Sorry. She's a little drunk.

1:28:01.901 --> 1:28:03.903
Um, if I may, uh…

1:28:05.905 --> 1:28:06.948
Pinky Auntie's right.

1:28:08.449 --> 1:28:12.662
I haven't been honest about who I am
for a very, very long time.

1:28:12.745 --> 1:28:13.955
It's okay, Ravi.

1:28:14.038 --> 1:28:17.375
Thank you, Uncle, but I'm sorry, um…

1:28:18.501 --> 1:28:20.837
Not for me. For the people I've hurt.

1:28:21.921 --> 1:28:23.965
Especially you, Asha.

1:28:24.507 --> 1:28:26.009
And to you, Nick and Priya.

1:28:26.092 --> 1:28:30.013
I, uh, know a wedding
isn't the place for this, but I, um…

1:28:30.638 --> 1:28:32.056
-Dad, just--
-Please.

1:28:32.140 --> 1:28:34.934
-What are you doing?
-Let me speak. Let me speak.

1:28:38.396 --> 1:28:44.652
Yes. Ravi did not graduate from MIT.
He does not have a start-up.

1:28:44.736 --> 1:28:47.196
-Is there a point? What are you doing?
-Yes.

1:28:47.989 --> 1:28:50.408
The point is that it doesn't matter.

1:28:51.075 --> 1:28:52.827
I, we…

1:28:55.538 --> 1:28:58.124
are very proud that you're our son.

1:28:58.207 --> 1:29:00.001
Aw.

1:29:00.585 --> 1:29:01.419
Thanks, Dad.

1:29:10.094 --> 1:29:11.220
Okay, enough.

1:29:20.855 --> 1:29:23.399
Asha, I'm sorry
I wasn't more honest with you.

1:29:26.027 --> 1:29:31.282
Reality is, I've never had truer feelings
than when I was pretending to date you.

1:29:33.284 --> 1:29:35.078
I wasn't even really pretending.

1:29:36.079 --> 1:29:37.622
Asha, you're gonna change the world.

1:29:38.873 --> 1:29:41.209
That beautiful mind and that big heart.

1:29:42.085 --> 1:29:44.921
I just hope there's room for me in it.
Someday.

1:29:55.807 --> 1:29:56.974
What about her?

1:30:00.561 --> 1:30:01.396
Me?

1:30:04.232 --> 1:30:07.193
That's Pihu. Um, she's my cousin.

1:30:07.276 --> 1:30:09.654
-Uh.

1:30:10.530 --> 1:30:11.614
Say hi, Pihu.

1:30:12.949 --> 1:30:13.783
Hi.
