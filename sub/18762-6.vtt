WEBVTT

00:10.105 --> 00:11.107
What's going on with you, man?

00:11.140 --> 00:12.375
Are you limping?

00:12.407 --> 00:13.943
Uh, no, I've just been working out

00:13.977 --> 00:15.779
on this new exercise bike I got,

00:15.812 --> 00:18.114
- and my glutes are, like, so sore.
- Yeah.

00:18.147 --> 00:19.315
Know what it is?
- Oh.

00:19.349 --> 00:20.983
- Yeah, big-time, big-time.
- Howdy.

00:21.017 --> 00:23.720
- Hi.
- It's... it's very windy today, isn't it?

00:23.752 --> 00:24.720
Yeah.

00:24.754 --> 00:26.790
Oh, man, look at this.

00:26.822 --> 00:28.490
Dog shit.

00:28.523 --> 00:30.559
Did you just step in that on purpose?

00:30.593 --> 00:32.963
Oh, no, I just...
you know, I didn't really see it.

00:33.011 --> 00:34.180
You pointed it out to me!

00:34.214 --> 00:35.815
And then you stepped directly in it.

00:35.849 --> 00:37.684
- Since when do you read?
- What? Nothing. No.

00:38.030 --> 00:39.509
Books are stupid.

00:39.543 --> 00:40.906
I don't. I was just...

00:42.345 --> 00:43.646
It wasn't... like, I didn't time it out.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.783
- I mean, why would I do that?
- I have no idea.

00:45.815 --> 00:48.117
- Why are you still standing in it?
- It was just an accident, man.

00:48.150 --> 00:49.686
People step in dog shit
accidentally all the time.

00:49.720 --> 00:51.888
Is that a lottery scratcher?

00:52.888 --> 00:53.857
Sometimes it's in,

00:53.890 --> 00:55.793
- sometimes it's out.
- Are those mirrors?

00:55.825 --> 00:57.327
- No.
- You creep.

01:05.260 --> 01:06.804
Look out, faggot!

01:19.830 --> 01:20.932
Holy shit.

01:20.965 --> 01:21.933
God!

01:22.083 --> 01:23.400
Are you okay?

01:24.834 --> 01:26.771
Hey, Frank, what the hell was that?

01:26.804 --> 01:28.906
What? I saved your life.

01:28.938 --> 01:30.206
But you called me the "F" word.

01:30.239 --> 01:32.108
So what? I'm a hero.

01:32.141 --> 01:33.610
You used a slur, dude.

01:33.643 --> 01:35.145
That's like a hate crime.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.214
Yeah, that's hateful speech, man.

01:36.247 --> 01:37.748
- You really can't...
- Yeah, but he saved his life.

01:37.780 --> 01:39.115
Yeah, but you can't say
that word anymore.

01:39.149 --> 01:40.617
So, which is it?

02:04.783 --> 02:06.506
<i>You are entitled to nothing!</i>

02:06.556 --> 02:08.169
Listen, motion to present

02:08.202 --> 02:09.551
articles of confederation.

02:09.584 --> 02:10.597
- Motion denied.
- Oh...

02:10.607 --> 02:12.417
Shut up, bitch.
You don't deserve anything.

02:12.450 --> 02:14.491
Excuse me. Hey. Can I help you?

02:14.525 --> 02:16.370
Okay, look, well, usually,
we're a pretty reasonable crew.

02:16.402 --> 02:17.984
- Yeah, right? I mean...
- Yeah.

02:18.015 --> 02:19.202
...we have our differences,
but we settle them in house.

02:19.235 --> 02:20.519
- Sure.
- We have a good process.

02:20.553 --> 02:21.903
There's filibusters, the whole thing.

02:21.935 --> 02:23.878
- No.
- This one's a doozy.

02:23.912 --> 02:25.196
- Yeah, this one we can't do in-house.
- We can't... we can't...

02:25.229 --> 02:27.205
That's why I wanted to
bring in a third party.

02:27.238 --> 02:29.642
Someone to hear us out and
deliver a final verdict.

02:29.675 --> 02:30.629
- That's you, guy.
- Yeah, that's... you.

02:30.663 --> 02:31.617
That's you.

02:31.651 --> 02:34.153
Because a great injustice
has occurred, okay?

02:34.187 --> 02:35.570
Frank committed a hate crime.

02:35.603 --> 02:36.986
I saved your life.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.128
- But you used a slur!
- It was a slur.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.674
- That's...
- You'd be dead if I didn't!

02:40.708 --> 02:41.893
Okay, okay, I think I'm getting it.

02:41.927 --> 02:43.706
You want me to figure out whether or not

02:43.737 --> 02:44.858
a hate crime's been committed?

02:44.891 --> 02:46.209
What?

02:46.240 --> 02:47.196
- No.
- No, no, no, no.

02:47.228 --> 02:48.414
- Way off. Way off.
- No, no, no, no, no.

02:48.447 --> 02:50.423
Oh, no, but, no,
it's not about that at all.

02:50.456 --> 02:52.236
Yeah, it's about this.

02:52.267 --> 02:54.935
A two-dollar scratcher lottery ticket.

02:54.969 --> 02:56.188
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

02:56.220 --> 02:58.888
Y-You've hired an arbitration attorney

02:58.920 --> 03:00.765
to figure out which of you is entitled

03:00.798 --> 03:01.984
to a two-dollar scratcher?

03:02.015 --> 03:02.971
- Now you're getting it.
- Me.

03:03.003 --> 03:04.651
- He's getting it.
- Now he gets it.

03:04.683 --> 03:06.725
The thing is, each one of us
feels that we're entitled

03:06.759 --> 03:08.043
to that ticket, and we need you

03:08.076 --> 03:09.658
- to tell us who it belongs to.
- Yeah.

03:09.690 --> 03:12.060
Why don't you scratch it
and see if it's worthless,

03:12.094 --> 03:14.598
and then you wouldn't have
to go through all of this?

03:14.629 --> 03:15.650
- Okay, so he's not getting it.
- What?!

03:15.684 --> 03:16.936
- Is he serious?
- Do you not want a job?

03:16.968 --> 03:18.812
Hold on. Is it Phil? Is your name Phil?

03:18.846 --> 03:20.460
- Yeah, Phil, yeah.
- It is Phil?

03:20.491 --> 03:21.547
It's Phil.

03:21.578 --> 03:23.423
This ticket represents hope, okay?

03:23.456 --> 03:25.038
Potential... yeah?

03:25.069 --> 03:26.388
Promise.

03:26.420 --> 03:29.845
The very foundation upon
which this group rests, eh?

03:29.878 --> 03:30.833
- Yes.
- And that hope

03:30.866 --> 03:32.382
belongs to me.

03:32.414 --> 03:34.127
It belongs to me, you son of a bitch!

03:36.466 --> 03:37.981
Please, stop.

03:38.012 --> 03:40.845
Each of you will have an
opportunity to plead your case.

03:40.879 --> 03:43.776
The only rule I have is that
you each treat each other

03:43.809 --> 03:46.938
with respect and common courtesy.

03:46.971 --> 03:49.276
Do we all agree to those terms?

03:51.285 --> 03:53.492
Well, we would like to thank you so much

03:53.525 --> 03:55.370
for taking our case so last-minute.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.147
The other guy was not our style.

03:57.179 --> 03:59.386
Well, I'm very happy to do so.

03:59.419 --> 04:01.758
I do have a few questions.

04:01.792 --> 04:03.075
- Fire away. - Yup.
- Of course, yeah.

04:03.109 --> 04:06.962
Now, the ticket in question,
uh, who purchased it?

04:06.994 --> 04:07.951
- Me! Thank you.
- Well...

04:07.983 --> 04:09.005
That was me, and that's why

04:09.038 --> 04:10.651
- this whole thing is so cut and dry.
- It's...

04:10.684 --> 04:11.935
Hold on. I purchased the ticket,

04:11.968 --> 04:14.537
and therefore the ticket belongs to me.

04:14.570 --> 04:17.930
<i>I actually bought the ticket
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

04:17.961 --> 04:20.661
<i>But I didn't realize it was
gonna be so goddamn blustery</i>

04:20.694 --> 04:21.767
<i>that afternoon.</i>

04:22.738 --> 04:25.076
<i>And as I was putting
my book into my purse,</i>

04:25.107 --> 04:27.644
<i>the ticket flew out and
landed on the ground.</i>

04:29.784 --> 04:31.597
So, you purchased the ticket
two weeks ago.

04:31.630 --> 04:32.684
I did.

04:32.717 --> 04:34.990
And why hadn't you
scratched the ticket yet?

04:35.021 --> 04:37.361
Oh... well, that's because

04:37.393 --> 04:39.007
nobody ever wins those tickets, right?

04:39.039 --> 04:40.786
But as long as you don't scratch it,

04:40.817 --> 04:42.103
then you're not a loser.

04:42.136 --> 04:45.199
You know, in fact, you're a winner.

04:45.230 --> 04:46.582
Potentially.

04:46.614 --> 04:48.557
- God, Dee...
- That is so sad!

04:48.590 --> 04:49.546
- It's so pathetic.
- What are...

04:49.579 --> 04:50.962
- It is pathetic.
- So sad.

04:50.993 --> 04:52.313
What are you talking... You just said

04:52.346 --> 04:53.893
this exact same thing,
like, ten minutes ago,

04:53.926 --> 04:54.913
talking about how the ticket

04:54.946 --> 04:55.935
represented hope and all that bullshit.

04:55.967 --> 04:58.701
Somehow coming from you,
it just came off so sad.

04:58.734 --> 05:00.579
Well, hold on a second.
Motion for sub-arbitration

05:00.612 --> 05:02.226
to determine whether or not that's sad.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.806
Motion accepted. All in favor?

05:03.839 --> 05:04.794
Aye.

05:04.827 --> 05:05.946
Motion passed. It's sad, Dee.

05:05.980 --> 05:07.099
I'd also like to point out

05:07.132 --> 05:09.208
that while Dee's version is the truth,

05:09.240 --> 05:10.886
it's not the whole truth.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.642
<i>Why don't we talk about the
contents of Dee's purse?</i>

05:15.659 --> 05:17.112
<i>The scratcher ticket,
the candy sour worms,</i>

05:17.145 --> 05:18.165
<i>the pack of cigarettes.</i>

05:18.198 --> 05:20.966
<i>Now, what I want to know is...</i>

05:20.998 --> 05:23.565
<i>how can a woman who makes
less than minimum wage</i>

05:23.599 --> 05:26.037
<i>afford such impulse buys?</i>

05:26.069 --> 05:28.869
So, you're smoking now, Dee?

05:28.901 --> 05:30.383
Is this about your weight?

05:30.416 --> 05:32.689
Because if it is,
you're already too bony.

05:32.722 --> 05:34.335
No, I don't think so.
I mean, I think you're

05:34.369 --> 05:35.455
getting pretty tubby
in the midsection area.

05:35.488 --> 05:36.872
- What?
- Like a bird.

05:36.905 --> 05:38.222
No, no, that's fine.

05:38.255 --> 05:40.922
Her hands are becoming a
major problem for me though.

05:40.955 --> 05:42.735
I have Parkinson's disease.

05:42.767 --> 05:44.018
What?

05:44.051 --> 05:46.851
Well, at least I have a 46% chance

05:46.884 --> 05:49.651
of getting Parkinson's disease,
according to a DNA test I took.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.351
The medical journal was
because I'm trying to learn

05:52.384 --> 05:54.557
as much as I can about this, you know?

05:54.591 --> 05:55.744
And, you guys, according to that,

05:55.775 --> 05:57.554
smoking can reduce your risk of...

05:57.588 --> 05:59.661
Oh, my God, who gives a shit?!

05:59.694 --> 06:01.441
- What?
- Dee, this isn't about whether or not

06:01.473 --> 06:03.451
you have some horrific
neurological disease

06:03.483 --> 06:05.262
or whether or not your
hands are the right size.

06:05.294 --> 06:07.403
They are, by the way,
but your elbows are a mess.

06:07.434 --> 06:08.587
They're too sharp.

06:08.621 --> 06:09.510
I don't like it. They're stabbing me.

06:09.541 --> 06:10.892
- That's what it is.
- You got it.

06:10.924 --> 06:12.540
That's not the point,
that's not the point.

06:12.573 --> 06:16.492
The point is:
how can you actually afford to smoke?

06:16.524 --> 06:18.467
You see, Dee and I had a deal.

06:18.500 --> 06:19.620
I give her money for coffee

06:19.654 --> 06:21.266
every morning on the way to work.

06:21.300 --> 06:23.836
<i>And she's instructed to give</i>

06:23.867 --> 06:25.647
<i>a very generous tip
to the cashier, Cassie.</i>

06:27.557 --> 06:30.225
<i>"This is from my boss, Dennis."</i>

06:30.257 --> 06:33.551
<i>Now, this establishes both
generosity and authority.</i>

06:33.584 --> 06:35.264
Possibly a little dominance.

06:35.296 --> 06:36.812
It's all a very choreographed dance

06:36.844 --> 06:38.030
between two soon-to-be lovers.

06:39.249 --> 06:40.007
Ah...

06:40.500 --> 06:42.016
Cassie's underage.

06:42.454 --> 06:44.385
No, no, no, what-what?
What are you talking about?

06:44.385 --> 06:46.133
Cassie is not underage.

06:46.165 --> 06:48.010
Cassie is 21 years old.

06:48.043 --> 06:50.644
<i>So, the champagne I was purchasing</i>

06:50.676 --> 06:53.049
<i>was to celebrate her
legal drinking status.</i>

06:53.081 --> 06:54.629
<i>And to honor her full maturity.</i>

06:56.046 --> 06:57.955
You see, I was waiting
for Cassie to mature.

06:57.988 --> 06:59.635
You know, much like an IRA.

06:59.668 --> 07:02.106
Y-You put the money in, then you wait.

07:02.138 --> 07:04.708
And then you make a hefty withdrawal.

07:06.913 --> 07:07.999
Okay, yeah, sure.

07:08.032 --> 07:10.635
Before full maturity, yeah, ew.

07:10.668 --> 07:11.885
Yeah, but weren't you just saying

07:11.919 --> 07:14.027
that you were doing
deposits before maturity?

07:14.059 --> 07:15.838
Uh, no, no, no, no.
See, that's where you're wrong.

07:15.871 --> 07:18.309
No, I was, uh,
between the ages of 18 and 21,

07:18.342 --> 07:19.791
simply making investments.

07:19.822 --> 07:21.338
But not for early deposits?

07:21.371 --> 07:23.150
Well, deposits
are part of the withdrawal.

07:23.182 --> 07:25.586
Sometimes I can't make a deposit at all.

07:25.619 --> 07:27.102
Ugh, come on, man.

07:27.134 --> 07:28.091
Just...

07:28.122 --> 07:29.407
Okay, just to be clear:

07:29.441 --> 07:30.857
a deposit's a load, right?

07:30.889 --> 07:32.569
- Yeah.
- Well, yeah, yeah.

07:32.601 --> 07:33.558
That's not what I'm talking about.

07:33.590 --> 07:35.105
No, it's a totally different...

07:35.138 --> 07:36.751
- Are you sure?
- No, with my... no.

07:36.784 --> 07:39.057
Look, not in this particular case,
it's not a lo...

07:39.090 --> 07:40.079
It's-it's...

07:42.318 --> 07:43.767
Yeah, it's a load.

07:43.798 --> 07:45.248
- Yeah. I mean, yeah.
- But that's not the point!

07:45.281 --> 07:46.467
That's not the point! The point is:

07:46.500 --> 07:48.543
Dee has no rightful
claim to that ticket,

07:48.574 --> 07:50.023
and I'll prove it.

07:50.057 --> 07:51.769
<i>You see, yesterday,</i>

07:51.801 --> 07:53.482
<i>after noticing the
contents of her purse,</i>

07:53.515 --> 07:56.182
<i>I decided to follow her this morning.</i>

07:56.216 --> 07:57.401
<i>Cassie never gets her tip,</i>

07:57.434 --> 07:59.049
does she, Dee?

07:59.080 --> 08:01.024
No. Because I refuse to tip for coffee.

08:01.056 --> 08:03.000
- I think it's dumb.
- Uh-huh.

08:03.033 --> 08:04.514
So if you were buying circus peanuts

08:04.547 --> 08:05.930
and candy sour worms and cigarettes,

08:05.963 --> 08:07.577
I think we all know what that means

08:07.610 --> 08:10.574
about the ticket in question, don't we?

08:12.187 --> 08:13.967
I don't. Do you know?

08:13.999 --> 08:15.646
- No.
- Totally lost.

08:15.679 --> 08:18.183
That means she bought it with my money!

08:18.215 --> 08:20.060
So, technically, that ticket is mine!

08:20.092 --> 08:21.740
Okay, okay, okay.

08:21.772 --> 08:24.177
Now, let me sum up the facts thus far.

08:24.208 --> 08:26.317
Miss Reynolds bought the ticket

08:26.350 --> 08:27.800
with Mr. Reynolds' money.

08:27.833 --> 08:30.270
But Mr. MacDonald
currently possesses it.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.760
Correct.
But I deserve it, and here's why.

08:33.792 --> 08:35.933
<i>There we were, right?</i>

08:35.966 --> 08:37.613
<i>We were just walking down the street,</i>

08:37.645 --> 08:38.898
<i>minding our own business.</i>

08:38.931 --> 08:41.533
<i>I'd just spotted the
perfect pile of dog shit,</i>

08:41.565 --> 08:42.553
<i>and naturally I stepped in it.</i>

08:42.586 --> 08:43.673
- What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:43.705 --> 08:45.320
Okay, I'm a little confused.

08:45.353 --> 08:48.318
Why would you voluntarily
step into the dog feces?

08:48.350 --> 08:49.898
- Well, I didn't, really...
- You just said you did.

08:49.931 --> 08:52.039
- You said naturally you did...
- And we all watched you do it.

08:52.071 --> 08:53.390
All right, fine.

08:53.422 --> 08:55.728
I voluntarily stepped in the dog shit

08:55.760 --> 08:59.744
so that I would smell of dog shit.
Happy?

08:59.778 --> 09:01.293
- Less happy.
- Why would it make me happy?

09:01.326 --> 09:02.906
I was trying to cover up the smell

09:02.938 --> 09:04.586
of the skunk that I let spray me

09:04.618 --> 09:06.332
so that there would be no questions.

09:06.364 --> 09:07.650
- Well, now I have more questions.
- Of course you do.

09:07.682 --> 09:09.461
Like: why did you let a skunk spray you?

09:09.492 --> 09:11.537
- To cover the smell of cologne, man.
- Oh, man. You know what?

09:11.569 --> 09:13.413
Go to the beginning.
Go to the first smell!

09:13.444 --> 09:15.158
The first smell that begat
all the other smells!

09:15.191 --> 09:17.233
The first smell was cigarettes!
I've been smoking with Dee!

09:17.265 --> 09:18.518
All right? Fine, I said it.

09:18.550 --> 09:20.098
Oh. Oh, okay. So, right.

09:20.131 --> 09:22.205
So you thought we would care
about the smell of cigarettes,

09:22.238 --> 09:24.050
- but not the smell of skunk or dog shit.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

09:24.084 --> 09:25.335
Well, it doesn't matter anyway,
all right,

09:25.368 --> 09:26.949
because I deserve the ticket.

09:26.982 --> 09:28.432
Because if the shit shoe's a matcher,

09:28.464 --> 09:29.814
Charlie gets the scratcher!

09:29.846 --> 09:31.131
- Oh... shit. - What the shit?
- Come on.

09:31.164 --> 09:33.042
That shirt reeks!

09:33.075 --> 09:34.030
- Is that what that smell was?
- Yeah.

09:34.063 --> 09:35.017
I thought it was just him.

09:35.051 --> 09:36.895
It does smell; it smells very bad.

09:36.928 --> 09:38.608
But give me a cigarette;
I'll cover it up.

09:38.639 --> 09:40.484
But, look, if it smells like shit,
you must acquit.

09:40.517 --> 09:42.395
You know what? If everyone's
gonna be smoking on my dime...

09:42.428 --> 09:44.141
Look, nobody is debating whether or not

09:44.174 --> 09:45.557
the shoe print is yours.

09:45.589 --> 09:46.776
We all know that it is,

09:46.808 --> 09:48.883
because everybody saw you kick me.

09:48.915 --> 09:50.661
We're debating whether or not
you actually saved my life.

09:50.694 --> 09:53.033
Which you did not,
because I was just about to do

09:53.065 --> 09:54.910
- a sweet backflip to safety when you...
- Oh, bullshit.

09:54.942 --> 09:56.424
He's never once flipped!

09:56.456 --> 09:57.972
- Here we go.
- I do flips all the time.

09:58.005 --> 09:59.223
- You have never once flipped.
- In the pool?

09:59.257 --> 10:00.738
Which you would not have done

10:00.771 --> 10:03.999
had I not warned you,
thereby saving your life!

10:04.032 --> 10:05.514
That is my ticket.

10:05.548 --> 10:07.260
Oh...

10:07.293 --> 10:09.406
Ridiculous. "Backflip."

10:12.740 --> 10:15.510
<i>There I was, minding my own business,</i>

10:15.680 --> 10:16.765
<i>bird watching.</i>

10:16.798 --> 10:18.056
Beautiful day, isn't it?

10:18.087 --> 10:19.689
It's really gorgeous and...

10:19.941 --> 10:20.965
Are those mirrors?

10:20.997 --> 10:23.047
- No.
- You creep.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.502
He wasn't really bird watching,

10:24.536 --> 10:26.023
he was looking up women's skirts.

10:26.056 --> 10:27.015
- He peeps on women.
- That's his move.

10:27.048 --> 10:28.040
He's disgusting.

10:28.073 --> 10:29.992
Like I said, bird watching.

10:30.025 --> 10:31.679
Not you.

10:31.711 --> 10:35.150
Now, the point is that I said,

10:35.182 --> 10:36.638
"Look out, faggot,"

10:36.671 --> 10:38.588
which were the words
that saved Mac's life.

10:38.621 --> 10:42.227
Thereby, I am entitled to
at least half that ticket.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.575
Well, why did you use the slur

10:44.607 --> 10:46.823
instead of just yelling
your friend's name?

10:46.856 --> 10:48.311
Well, there was a lot going on.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.295
I needed something
that would cut through.

10:50.326 --> 10:52.212
Well, as soon as I said the slur,

10:52.245 --> 10:55.652
everybody knew to look at Mac.

10:55.685 --> 10:56.842
Look out, faggot!

10:56.874 --> 10:57.999
<i>Mac knew to look.</i>

10:58.031 --> 11:01.040
<i>Dennis and Dee knew to look.</i>

11:01.074 --> 11:03.257
<i>Charlie, who kicked him in the chest,</i>

11:03.290 --> 11:05.108
<i>knew to look.</i>

11:05.140 --> 11:08.183
<i>Hell, even the little kid
with the balloon</i>

11:08.216 --> 11:09.572
<i>knew where to look.</i>

11:09.604 --> 11:13.177
Okay, it may have been effective,

11:13.209 --> 11:15.291
but it was an offensive slur.

11:15.325 --> 11:18.014
And a bigot should not be
entitled to a hero's payout.

11:18.066 --> 11:20.843
You're allowed to use
any language you want

11:20.876 --> 11:22.167
to save somebody's life.

11:22.814 --> 11:23.986
- Really? Any language?
- Yes.

11:24.019 --> 11:25.970
- You gonna let a man die over a word?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:26.002 --> 11:27.655
I mean, come on. It's just a word.

11:27.689 --> 11:29.938
"Just a word." Oh. Okay.

11:29.970 --> 11:31.491
Well, Frank, tell me something:

11:31.524 --> 11:33.476
If you were going to save
somebody else's life,

11:33.507 --> 11:36.087
you know, from a falling piano,
and you needed a word to just...

11:36.121 --> 11:38.006
- to just cut right through...
- Mm-hmm.

11:38.038 --> 11:41.246
...what word would you use
to call out to the arbiter?

11:45.709 --> 11:46.834
Uh...

11:46.867 --> 11:49.281
I suppose...

11:49.315 --> 11:51.429
Yeah, you know what?
We're, uh, we're treading

11:51.463 --> 11:52.787
- on some dangerous territory here, buddy.
- Yeah.

11:52.820 --> 11:53.878
"Nigger"?

11:53.911 --> 11:55.101
Oh! Whoa, whoa!

11:55.133 --> 11:56.928
- What, what?
- Charlie, you can't use that word.

11:56.963 --> 11:59.002
I'm trying to guess
the word that he was saying

11:59.034 --> 12:00.887
- that he thought Frank was gonna say.
- No, you don't say that ever.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.054
- I was not using the word.
- Don't ever... that's not...

12:02.054 --> 12:04.161
You can't use that word, buddy.

12:04.193 --> 12:05.814
And yet, we've just sort of been

12:05.846 --> 12:07.633
casually throwing the F-word around

12:07.666 --> 12:08.791
willy-nilly for the past few days,

12:08.823 --> 12:10.444
and that hasn't been a problem?

12:10.476 --> 12:13.486
Well, yeah, Mac, because the...
there's a very dark history

12:13.518 --> 12:15.701
- associated with... the N-word.
- Yeah.

12:15.734 --> 12:18.379
Did you know that a faggot
is a burning bundle of sticks

12:18.411 --> 12:20.429
on top of which they
used to burn homosexuals?

12:20.463 --> 12:23.475
So, basically,
when you call someone a "faggot,"

12:23.508 --> 12:25.890
you are saying that they
should be burned at the stake.

12:27.434 --> 12:29.097
Is that right? That's, uh...

12:29.132 --> 12:30.483
- Yes.
- That's pretty dark, yeah, that's dark.

12:30.515 --> 12:32.301
- That's pretty dark.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:32.333 --> 12:33.557
Well, maybe there are a few words

12:33.590 --> 12:34.549
- that we shouldn't be throwing around.
- Yep.

12:34.581 --> 12:35.606
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:35.639 --> 12:36.598
- What about "cunt"?
- Oh!

12:36.631 --> 12:37.557
We can't lose that!

12:37.591 --> 12:38.947
- Yeah, it's a good word.
- What?

12:38.978 --> 12:40.203
That's tough. It's a great word.

12:40.236 --> 12:41.261
And it's just not offensive.

12:41.294 --> 12:42.848
Especially, uh, directed towards

12:42.881 --> 12:44.627
a woman when you're trying
to insult her.

12:45.075 --> 12:47.544
When you're trying to
make a woman feel small.

12:47.577 --> 12:49.528
That's extremely offensive!

12:49.560 --> 12:50.949
Come on, you could yell "penis" at me,

12:50.981 --> 12:52.734
and I'd be fine with it.
Well, all right, fine.

12:52.767 --> 12:54.289
Well, then, we're gonna
take away your favorite word.

12:54.323 --> 12:55.480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:55.512 --> 12:56.471
- What, "cocksucker"? - Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:56.505 --> 12:57.729
What's wrong with that?

12:57.761 --> 13:00.208
You can't say "cocksucker"
if we can't say "cunt."

13:00.241 --> 13:01.399
I find it offensive that the idea

13:01.431 --> 13:03.218
of sucking cocks is offensive.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.729
Exactly. There's nothing
offensive about sucking cock.

13:05.763 --> 13:07.351
Half the population loves to suck cock.

13:07.383 --> 13:08.706
The other half of the population,

13:08.738 --> 13:10.028
they love getting their cock sucked.

13:10.062 --> 13:11.186
It's kind of a win-win.

13:11.219 --> 13:12.342
We're getting off the point, okay?

13:12.372 --> 13:16.341
In terms of the ticket,
I'm calling bullshit on Frank,

13:16.374 --> 13:18.656
because, for some reason,
he thinks that I'm gay,

13:18.689 --> 13:20.640
and that is why he called me the F-word,

13:20.672 --> 13:21.829
which makes him a bigot.

13:21.863 --> 13:23.516
Oh, wait.

13:23.550 --> 13:24.774
Uh, catch me up here.

13:24.806 --> 13:26.394
Now, you're not gay?

13:26.427 --> 13:27.650
Obviously not.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.270
Okay. Interesting.

13:29.303 --> 13:32.378
So, Mr. Reynolds, um, simply,

13:32.411 --> 13:34.031
was just trying to disrespect you.

13:34.065 --> 13:35.917
He wasn't trying to make a comment

13:35.950 --> 13:37.867
about your sexual orientation?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.115
No, well, see, here's where things
get just a little bit

13:40.149 --> 13:43.951
tricky, because Frank
thinks Mac is gay because...

13:43.984 --> 13:45.505
- Mac is gay.
- Yeah.

13:45.538 --> 13:47.490
What?! What-what are you talking about?

13:47.523 --> 13:49.077
Enough with this.

13:49.109 --> 13:50.433
- This is boring.
- I mean, he's into the closet,

13:50.465 --> 13:51.457
- he's out of the closet.
- Yeah, yeah.

13:51.490 --> 13:52.548
We don't like you either way.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.400
Oh, look, now, I care about my body.

13:54.433 --> 13:55.408
So now they become, like,
obsessed with me being gay.

13:55.418 --> 13:57.641
Obsessed? We don't care!
We're the ones who don't care.

13:57.673 --> 13:58.797
Okay. All right, hold on.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.550
Dee, let me just...
let me put this to bed.

14:00.583 --> 14:02.535
Okay, Mac, we're in support of it.

14:02.567 --> 14:04.088
So, just come on out of the closet

14:04.122 --> 14:05.114
- and be done with it.
- You'll feel better.

14:05.147 --> 14:06.305
- You'll feel better.
- Come on.

14:07.265 --> 14:09.412
I honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:09.445 --> 14:11.049
Mac, Mac...

14:13.480 --> 14:14.704
We found the bike.

14:14.737 --> 14:16.489
Yeah, so?

14:17.360 --> 14:20.205
The bike in the basement?

14:21.229 --> 14:23.082
What about it?

14:23.669 --> 14:25.786
Oh, Mac.

14:25.819 --> 14:27.308
Mac,

14:27.341 --> 14:28.664
- don't make me go get the bike.
- Oh.

14:28.695 --> 14:30.581
I've got nothing to hide.

14:30.614 --> 14:32.433
Just, uh, go get the bike.

14:33.727 --> 14:35.175
I'm-a go get the bike.

14:38.625 --> 14:41.978
I would like to present
into evidence, uh...

14:43.490 --> 14:46.153
Mac's bike.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.520
What? It's an awesome workout bike.

14:48.552 --> 14:49.505
What's the big deal?

14:49.539 --> 14:50.986
Okay.

14:51.018 --> 14:53.648
Mac, why don't you go
ahead and operate the bike.

14:53.681 --> 14:54.898
Yeah.

14:54.930 --> 14:56.409
Sure.

14:56.442 --> 14:58.975
No problem.
Just-just like any other workout bike.

14:59.006 --> 14:59.960
Well...

14:59.994 --> 15:01.375
You pedal...

15:05.121 --> 15:06.962
Uh, there you go.

15:06.996 --> 15:07.949
Outrageous.

15:07.981 --> 15:09.034
Yeah, there it is.

15:09.066 --> 15:11.631
I mean, it's just the craziest...

15:11.663 --> 15:12.814
All right, all right, all right.

15:12.847 --> 15:13.673
Okay, I...

15:14.063 --> 15:15.446
I know what you're thinking, okay?

15:15.478 --> 15:17.320
But it is not what it looks like.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.962
Yeah, what it looks like

15:18.995 --> 15:21.230
is that you are fucking
yourself with a dildo bike.

15:21.263 --> 15:22.217
I mean, you got the bike shorts

15:22.249 --> 15:23.466
with the slits in them, in the...

15:23.499 --> 15:25.933
Oh, the-the ones in the back?
That's for air flow.

15:25.965 --> 15:27.083
This is grotesque.

15:27.114 --> 15:28.397
No, you're not understanding.

15:28.431 --> 15:30.140
I modded out a regular workout bike,

15:30.174 --> 15:31.916
to create the optimal workout.

15:31.948 --> 15:34.185
- And added a penis.
- Yeah.

15:34.217 --> 15:35.722
Oh... I see.

15:36.550 --> 15:38.852
I see where you guys are
getting off the rails.

15:38.884 --> 15:39.903
That's not a penis.

15:39.936 --> 15:41.286
Oh.

15:41.318 --> 15:42.176
It's a fist.

15:42.632 --> 15:44.342
Uh...

15:44.374 --> 15:46.315
I call it the Ass Pounder 4000.

15:46.347 --> 15:48.056
- And it works like this.
- Uh, no...

15:48.089 --> 15:50.490
Imagine you're riding up a steep hill,

15:50.523 --> 15:53.218
and you've already been
working super hard,

15:53.252 --> 15:55.060
and you're sweating and you're tired.

15:55.091 --> 15:57.163
What do you do when you're tired?
You want to rest.

15:57.197 --> 15:58.381
You go to sit down,

15:58.414 --> 16:00.452
it pushes you right
back up in your workout.

16:00.485 --> 16:02.359
The Ass Pounder 4000
will never let you rest.

16:02.390 --> 16:04.396
- Yeah, see?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we got it.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.613
- That's the way it works.
- We got it.

16:05.644 --> 16:08.243
Now, I even have an amazing tagline.

16:08.276 --> 16:11.169
"The Ass Pounder: Never stop pumping."

16:17.020 --> 16:18.960
Well, um...

16:18.992 --> 16:20.504
think we've seen enough.

16:20.537 --> 16:22.050
I've certainly learned something.

16:22.084 --> 16:25.338
This... this has nothing to do
with being gay.

16:25.371 --> 16:26.983
This is just the work of a man who's

16:27.015 --> 16:28.330
an extreme sexual deviant.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.808
Gay or not.

16:29.841 --> 16:31.748
- Can I have one of those?
- Yeah, whatever,

16:31.782 --> 16:32.998
- Yeah, whatever, dude.
- Oh, whatever.

16:33.031 --> 16:34.839
You know, you guys are just
jealous because I've got

16:34.871 --> 16:37.009
<i>a million-dollar idea
and I've got the ticket.</i>

16:37.040 --> 16:38.818
You don't have the ticket yet, bitch!

16:38.849 --> 16:40.000
I bought the ticket.

16:40.034 --> 16:41.939
What are you talking about?!
Are you crazy?!

16:43.616 --> 16:45.391
Quiet! Quiet!

16:45.424 --> 16:46.904
Quiet!

16:46.937 --> 16:48.877
Now, I've heard from everybody involved,

16:48.910 --> 16:51.113
and I will make my decision.

16:51.145 --> 16:52.822
But let me make one thing clear.

16:54.300 --> 16:56.570
In order for this to be entirely just,

16:56.603 --> 17:01.337
I will make my decision based
on fairness and compromise.

17:01.369 --> 17:02.455
You understand?

17:05.741 --> 17:08.405
Okay, I think I'm all caught up.

17:08.436 --> 17:10.377
- All right, so what's the verdict?
- Yeah, what do you got?

17:10.410 --> 17:13.499
I think it's actually
pretty straightforward.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.473
Mr. MacDonald is in
possession of the ticket,

17:15.503 --> 17:16.557
so he has ownership.

17:16.589 --> 17:18.300
However, he would not be

17:18.333 --> 17:21.259
in possession if his life were
not saved by Mr. Reynolds,

17:21.291 --> 17:24.152
who set off the chain
of events saving him.

17:25.054 --> 17:26.945
So I see it as a 50/50 split.

17:27.288 --> 17:28.787
- Are you kidding me?
- I'm a hero!

17:28.820 --> 17:29.970
- Oh! You bitch!
- 50/50 split?

17:30.004 --> 17:31.221
- ...out of the way!
- Nothing for the man

17:31.252 --> 17:33.028
- who paid for the ticket?
- I bought it!

17:33.060 --> 17:35.460
And this bigot here is
gonna get a hero's payout?

17:35.493 --> 17:38.156
He may be a bigot and he
did use disgusting speech,

17:38.189 --> 17:39.571
but it's not technically

17:39.603 --> 17:42.925
hate speech since Mr. MacDonald
does not claim to be gay.

17:42.957 --> 17:44.897
Oh.

17:44.929 --> 17:47.987
Oh, does that mean if I claim to be gay,
I get all of it?

17:48.018 --> 17:49.959
Well, um, y-yes.

17:49.991 --> 17:51.997
You would be entitled to keep all of it.

17:52.031 --> 17:53.149
I claim to be gay!

17:53.180 --> 17:54.431
- No!
- No, no, no, no.

17:54.432 --> 17:55.432
Now you're gay?

17:55.448 --> 17:56.928
There's a history behind it.

17:56.961 --> 17:57.916
I've been gay forever.

17:57.947 --> 18:00.151
Everybody knows it.
Even the balloon kid knew it.

18:00.183 --> 18:02.189
Soon as he gets that ticket,
he's going back in the closet.

18:02.220 --> 18:03.405
- Yeah. This isn't fair.
- Mark my words.

18:03.438 --> 18:04.819
If he's gonna do it,
he's got to stay out,

18:04.852 --> 18:05.806
which he won't, I guarantee you.

18:05.837 --> 18:07.382
Fine. Whatever. Yeah. I'm out!

18:07.416 --> 18:08.895
Totally out. I'm gonna...

18:08.927 --> 18:10.702
Hey, uh, excuse me,
would you please do the honors

18:10.735 --> 18:12.774
<i>on my ticket, please?</i>

18:12.807 --> 18:15.141
- It's probably worthless.
- Okay. Sure.

18:15.175 --> 18:17.641
Let's, uh...
let's see what we have here.

18:17.672 --> 18:18.429
Okay.

18:20.435 --> 18:21.650
Wow.

18:21.683 --> 18:22.703
What?

18:22.736 --> 18:24.709
- What is it?
- Well, you're a winner.

18:24.741 --> 18:26.746
What? How much?

18:26.778 --> 18:28.817
$10,000.

18:28.958 --> 18:29.902
What?!

18:29.935 --> 18:32.106
- No! No!
- Oh, my God!

18:32.137 --> 18:33.354
Gay Mac rules!

18:33.387 --> 18:35.657
- Bullshit!
- Gay-gay, rich Mac!

18:35.689 --> 18:38.285
All right, if you will just sign this,
releasing the ticket

18:38.319 --> 18:41.212
- and agreeing to my ruling.
- Don't mind if I do.

18:41.474 --> 18:43.875
I wonder what I'm gonna do
with all this money.

18:43.906 --> 18:45.386
Maybe start an LLC.

18:45.629 --> 18:47.031
Ass Pounder 4000?

18:47.064 --> 18:49.201
It's all going right into the product.

18:49.234 --> 18:51.831
Yeah, yeah, sign the paper so
you can go back in the closet.

18:51.862 --> 18:52.949
- Yeah.
- Go ahead.

18:52.981 --> 18:54.921
- You go back in. Go ahead.
- Huh?

18:54.953 --> 18:56.893
Well, you signed the thing.
You got your money.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.867
Just go back in the closet.
Just get it over with.

18:58.899 --> 19:01.627
We know you're gonna do it,
so you might as well just do it.

19:01.659 --> 19:03.402
Yeah. Yeah.

19:03.435 --> 19:07.939
I don't know.
Maybe I'll... maybe I'll stay out.

19:08.540 --> 19:09.407
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:09.599 --> 19:10.308
It doesn't matter.

19:10.338 --> 19:11.769
You can just go back in.
You signed the paper.

19:11.769 --> 19:13.823
Y-Yeah. I mean, you got your money.

19:13.857 --> 19:15.147
No, I think I'm out now.

19:16.683 --> 19:19.413
Yeah. I'm... I'm gay.

19:19.446 --> 19:22.011
Actually feels pretty good.

19:22.043 --> 19:23.522
See ya, guys.

19:29.472 --> 19:31.413
- Wow.
- Finally.

19:31.445 --> 19:33.583
- Eh, good for him, right?
- Yeah, good for him. I'm...

19:33.614 --> 19:35.390
- Absolutely.
- Guess I'm happy for him.

19:35.422 --> 19:37.002
Yeah, it's a relief, honestly.

19:37.033 --> 19:39.499
All right, if, uh,
you'll just take care of this,

19:39.533 --> 19:41.276
then, uh, we'll be all done.

19:41.307 --> 19:43.445
- What's this?
- That would be a bill.

19:43.477 --> 19:44.497
- Ooh.
- Oh, money stuff.

19:44.528 --> 19:45.976
- Uh...
- That goes to Frank.

19:46.009 --> 19:47.653
I know it's steep,
but you did go through

19:47.686 --> 19:51.237
three arbiters,
and you've been here 17 hours.

19:51.269 --> 19:52.748
- Yeah. I'm exhausted.
- Yikes, yikes.

19:52.780 --> 19:54.227
What's-what's it add up to there, Frank?

19:54.261 --> 19:56.727
$9,986.

19:56.758 --> 19:58.896
- Yikes.
- Holy cow, you guys aren't cheap.

19:58.928 --> 20:00.177
You guys aren't cheap.

20:00.211 --> 20:02.414
The arbitration was Mac's idea.

20:02.446 --> 20:04.716
- Let's let him pay for it.
- That's a great idea.

20:04.747 --> 20:06.456
- That's fair. In fairness' sake.
- Yeah.

20:06.489 --> 20:08.923
- Yeah, he's got the money for it.
- He's got the money now. Yeah.

20:08.956 --> 20:11.289
But maybe let's make him
pay it tomorrow, you know?

20:11.322 --> 20:13.295
- L-Let's let him have this.
- Yeah. Yeah.

20:13.328 --> 20:16.879
Poor guy did just come
out over a $14 scratcher.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.128
- That's all that's left?
- Yeah.

20:18.161 --> 20:19.936
- Oh, no.
- That sucks.

20:19.969 --> 20:20.987
Oh, no.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.698
Tell you what, man, I am happy for him,

20:22.731 --> 20:24.932
- but I do still hate him.
- Oh, yeah.

20:24.966 --> 20:27.399
- It's not a gay or straight thing, is it?
- No, no, no, no, no.

20:27.432 --> 20:28.729
It's a Mac thing.
