00:14.667 --> 00:18.000
- Three sodas,
and one is primed to explode.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.867
Lawrence, I have to admit,

00:20.867 --> 00:23.600
soda roulette
is pure genius.

00:23.600 --> 00:24.800
- Thanks.

00:24.800 --> 00:27.167
- This will be the coolest
viral video ever!

00:27.167 --> 00:30.867
- Cooler than
"Monkey Smelling Butt"?

00:30.867 --> 00:32.033
- Yes.

00:32.033 --> 00:34.667
- You flatter me, sir.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.067
- So I'll start filming,
and you can start popping tops.

00:37.067 --> 00:41.133
- Whoa, um, I was kind of
thinking I'd film and you'd pop.

00:41.133 --> 00:42.533
- What made you think that?

00:42.533 --> 00:44.433
- Well, so far, I've starred
in "Spaghetti Head,"

00:44.433 --> 00:46.800
"Pie Face,"
and "Soccer Ball Surprise."

00:46.800 --> 00:50.233
- For some reason, it's funnier
when bad things happen to you.

00:50.233 --> 00:51.533
You have a gift.

00:51.533 --> 00:52.867
- Really?

00:52.867 --> 00:54.267
Wow! Thanks!

00:54.267 --> 00:56.000
- Let's do it.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.067
And...

00:57.067 --> 00:58.400
Action.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.867
- I guess this'll be fun.

00:59.867 --> 01:02.800
I mean, how much soda
can shoot out of one can?

01:10.833 --> 01:12.467
Ahh.

01:12.467 --> 01:15.800
The answer--
a truly surprising amount.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.267
- That was amazing!

01:18.267 --> 01:20.367
- Hey, don't ask me how,

01:20.367 --> 01:22.467
but I got us an audition
for our first gig

01:22.467 --> 01:25.167
with a very important
music bigwig.

01:25.167 --> 01:26.867
So dry off
and meet me in class.

01:26.867 --> 01:29.500
- Aren't you at all curious
why I'm covered in soda?

01:29.500 --> 01:33.333
- No. I know soda roulette
when I see it.

01:36.167 --> 01:39.167
[playing rock music]

01:39.167 --> 01:47.467
*

01:49.933 --> 01:51.833
[all cheering]

01:51.833 --> 01:53.567
Nailed it!

01:53.567 --> 01:55.067
But it doesn't matter
what I think.

01:55.067 --> 01:59.633
Our fate rests in the musical
tastes of Mr. Big.

01:59.633 --> 02:01.767
What do you think?

02:01.767 --> 02:04.733
- [slurping]

02:04.733 --> 02:05.900
Meh.

02:05.900 --> 02:08.533
- We just melted your face.

02:08.533 --> 02:11.133
- No, you didn't.
My face is fine.

02:11.133 --> 02:14.667
- I'm telling you, Alison,

02:14.667 --> 02:17.067
this band is going to rock
your birthday party.

02:17.067 --> 02:19.800
- We're playing a
seven-year-old's birthday party?

02:19.800 --> 02:21.933
I thought we weren't supposed
to hit rock bottom

02:21.933 --> 02:23.433
until our mid-20s.

02:23.433 --> 02:25.567
- At least we're headlining.

02:25.567 --> 02:27.533
- Actually,
I'm thinking of getting

02:27.533 --> 02:29.233
a magic princess instead.

02:30.267 --> 02:32.700
- I spoke too soon.

02:32.700 --> 02:35.533
- Princess Oliviana--
who's that?

02:35.533 --> 02:37.300
- Are you serious?

02:37.300 --> 02:39.567
She's the princess from the
movie "Everyone's A Princess."

02:39.567 --> 02:41.067
- She sings
"Tell Me Something True."

02:41.067 --> 02:42.467
You know...

02:42.467 --> 02:44.233
* Tell me something new,
tell me something true *

02:44.233 --> 02:46.900
* Can I be the princess
of your dreams? *

02:46.900 --> 02:49.367
all: * Tell me something new,
are we coming true? *

02:49.367 --> 02:50.533
* Or is this another...

02:50.533 --> 02:52.833
- Stop that terrible song!

02:52.833 --> 02:54.400
[sighs]

02:54.400 --> 02:57.300
Alison, what do you say?

02:57.300 --> 02:58.900
Can we play your party?

02:58.900 --> 03:03.200
- Okay, but only because
you agreed to be paid in cake.

03:03.200 --> 03:04.333
- Yes!

03:04.333 --> 03:06.567
We got a gig!
We got a gig!

03:06.567 --> 03:08.833
Oh, sweet mother of--

03:08.833 --> 03:09.900
I mean, thank you.

03:09.900 --> 03:11.800
- Uh-huh.

03:11.800 --> 03:15.267
Now, what's your band's name, so
I can put it on the invitations?

03:15.267 --> 03:16.400
- Uh...

03:16.400 --> 03:17.967
- Uh, we don't have
a name yet.

03:17.967 --> 03:19.967
- Well, you better come up
with one by next week,

03:19.967 --> 03:23.233
or I'm going with
The Princess Party Band.

03:23.233 --> 03:24.867
Now, juice box me
for the road.

03:24.867 --> 03:26.367
- Juice box me.

03:26.367 --> 03:28.467
[thud]

03:28.467 --> 03:31.500
- Amateurs.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.633
- * Stop tellin' me
to read between the lines *

03:34.633 --> 03:37.267
* It all adds up
to one thing *

03:37.267 --> 03:38.800
- Five, four, three,
two, one *

03:38.800 --> 03:41.133
- * If you think you're gonna
lose your cool *

03:41.133 --> 03:43.967
* Well, sometimes you gotta
break the rules *

03:43.967 --> 03:46.567
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

03:46.567 --> 03:49.100
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

03:49.100 --> 03:51.833
* If you're feeling like
you're gettin' schooled *

03:51.833 --> 03:54.467
* There's an answer
right in front of you *

03:54.467 --> 03:57.433
* Hey, show me what you know,
give it up to rock 'n' roll *

03:57.433 --> 03:58.933
* 'Cause we ain't
gonna stop *

03:58.933 --> 04:01.100
- * Hey!
- * Are you ready to rock?

04:04.767 --> 04:08.400
- Hey, Zack, here's my share
of our video game subscription.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.067
- Oh, thanks. The last time
I didn't pay my dad back,

04:11.067 --> 04:12.700
he repo'd my bike.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.400
- Since it's my turn
to pick next,

04:14.400 --> 04:16.867
I want to get the new
Dr. Timewarp game--

04:16.867 --> 04:18.500
"Wormhole of Justice."

04:18.500 --> 04:20.133
It's my destiny.

04:20.133 --> 04:22.700
- Oh, sorry,
no can do, "broseph."

04:22.700 --> 04:24.833
I already ordered
"Legions of Horror" last night.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.533
- That's brutal.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.667
I've been waiting my whole life
for this game.

04:28.667 --> 04:31.300
- That's why I thought you
should hear it from a friend.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.533
Good talk.

04:33.533 --> 04:37.433
- Why do you let Zack
boss you around like that?

04:37.433 --> 04:38.867
- Nobody bosses me around.

04:38.867 --> 04:41.400
- Tie my shoe.
- Double-knotted or single?

04:41.400 --> 04:43.167
- [sighs]
Stop.

04:43.167 --> 04:46.433
Just because I say something
doesn't mean you have to do it.

04:46.433 --> 04:47.667
Same goes for Zack.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.200
- He's my best friend.

04:49.200 --> 04:51.900
- Your friendship seems
a little one-sided.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.433
You're better than that,
Lawrence.

04:53.433 --> 04:56.133
- I am?
- In theory.

04:56.133 --> 04:59.067
- Tomika, I know
what you're getting at.

04:59.067 --> 05:01.067
You want to be
my best friend too.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.867
- That's not my--
- Sorry.

05:02.867 --> 05:04.067
Call me old-fashioned,

05:04.067 --> 05:05.933
but I can only have
one best friend.

05:05.933 --> 05:07.500
- Lawrence,
I think you're missing--

05:07.500 --> 05:08.767
- Shh.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.833
Shh.

05:12.533 --> 05:14.300
Shh!

05:16.700 --> 05:20.067
- Today's lesson is on
the importance of our first gig.

05:20.067 --> 05:22.467
Our group
needs to be road tested

05:22.467 --> 05:23.467
for Battle of the Bands.

05:23.467 --> 05:25.067
The Beatles had Hamburg.

05:25.067 --> 05:26.933
We have
Alison's princess party--

05:26.933 --> 05:28.800
totally the same thing.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.933
- What about our band name?
- Excellent question, Summer.

05:31.933 --> 05:33.233
Finding the right band name

05:33.233 --> 05:36.067
is the second most
difficult task in rock.

05:36.067 --> 05:38.567
The first is how to not look
stupid doing this.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.067
[babbling]

05:41.067 --> 05:43.067
- Keep working on it.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.467
- Luckily for you kids,

05:44.467 --> 05:47.300
I've already come up
with the perfect name...

05:50.267 --> 05:51.533
Paradoxx!

05:51.533 --> 05:53.867
Oxx, oxx, oxx.

05:55.800 --> 05:56.800
Crowd noise.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.867
[imitates crowd cheering]

06:00.867 --> 06:03.600
I sense some hesitation.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.067
- Paradoxx?

06:05.067 --> 06:08.667
- Does anybody have
any better names?

06:08.667 --> 06:10.600
All right, fine.
Let's hear some band names

06:10.600 --> 06:12.267
that are probably not as good
as Paradoxx.

06:12.267 --> 06:14.267
- Smog Check.
- [imitates buzzer sounding]

06:14.267 --> 06:17.067
- T.H.B.--
Totally Harvard Bound.

06:17.067 --> 06:18.300
- Totally no.

06:18.300 --> 06:20.167
Tomika?
- Don't care.

06:20.167 --> 06:21.800
- Hmm.
- Great name.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.900
- No, I mean I don't care.

06:24.900 --> 06:28.067
You can't force a name.
When it's right, it'll happen.

06:28.067 --> 06:29.067
- Great point.

06:29.067 --> 06:31.833
- I like the name Timewarp.

06:31.833 --> 06:33.200
- Shocker.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.200
- I'm torn between
two awesome names--

06:35.200 --> 06:38.533
Metal Death Fire Skulls
or Skulls of Fire Death Metal.

06:38.533 --> 06:40.100
It's a tough one.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.333
- It's pretty clear to me

06:41.333 --> 06:42.867
none of those
are as good as Paradoxx.

06:42.867 --> 06:44.233
So we'll just go with that.

06:44.233 --> 06:45.967
- No!
Totally Harvard Bound.

06:45.967 --> 06:47.533
- Smog Check!
- Timewarp!

06:47.533 --> 06:49.933
- Skull Fire--
whatever mine was!

06:49.933 --> 06:52.067
[indistinct arguing]

06:52.067 --> 06:53.267
- Okay.

06:53.267 --> 06:54.900
Okay!

06:54.900 --> 06:56.733
This is natural.

06:56.733 --> 06:58.100
Bands need to disagree

06:58.100 --> 07:00.267
and get their frustrations out
early on,

07:00.267 --> 07:01.767
or they'll just break up.

07:01.767 --> 07:05.333
Pete Townshend once hit
Roger Daltrey with his guitar,

07:05.333 --> 07:07.200
and The Who are still together.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.967
- Hmm, gotcha, Mr. Finn.

07:08.967 --> 07:10.733
Who do I get to hit
with my guitar?

07:10.733 --> 07:11.833
- Nobody.

07:11.833 --> 07:13.367
We'll vote on this tomorrow.

07:13.367 --> 07:14.800
Settle this like adults--

07:14.800 --> 07:17.500
rationally and calmly.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.800
- Mm, right.

07:18.800 --> 07:21.400
And after that I get to start
bashing people?

07:24.133 --> 07:26.433
- * Tell me something new,
tell me something true *

07:26.433 --> 07:29.133
* Can I be the princess
of your dreams? *

07:29.133 --> 07:31.167
- [clears throat]

07:31.167 --> 07:32.333
Are you singing
a princess song?

07:32.333 --> 07:35.267
- No.
How much did you hear?

07:35.267 --> 07:37.833
- Enough to make this weird.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.067
Look, I told you

07:39.067 --> 07:40.433
to get these boxes
of Paradoxx T-shirts

07:40.433 --> 07:43.300
out of the garage
over a year ago.

07:44.433 --> 07:46.300
How many failed bands
is it now?

07:46.300 --> 07:49.233
- Dad, there's no such thing
as failure.

07:49.233 --> 07:50.467
That's what you always
used to tell me

07:50.467 --> 07:52.200
when I struck out
in little league.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.567
- I was lying to you.
You were eight.

07:55.567 --> 07:57.667
Just get the boxes
out of the garage.

07:57.667 --> 08:01.233
And, son, if you're gonna sing
a princess song in my house,

08:01.233 --> 08:04.267
you do it in the shower
like a man.

08:04.267 --> 08:07.900
* Can I be the princess
of your dreams? *

08:07.900 --> 08:10.933
Dang it!
You got me singing it.

08:10.933 --> 08:12.633
Now I have to bathe.

08:14.767 --> 08:17.967
- Zack, "Gamer Magazine"
gave "Wormhole of Justice"

08:17.967 --> 08:19.233
five thumb blisters up.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.867
I can't wait!

08:20.867 --> 08:22.833
And since it's my turn--

08:22.833 --> 08:24.100
- Oh, forgot to tell you--

08:24.100 --> 08:26.333
I ordered the next six
"Legions of Horror."

08:26.333 --> 08:27.900
It should only take
two or three months

08:27.900 --> 08:29.067
to get to your game.

08:29.067 --> 08:30.833
That's cool, right?

08:30.833 --> 08:32.667
- Yeah, okay.

08:32.667 --> 08:33.800
Excuse me.

08:37.133 --> 08:41.333
[yelling]

08:44.900 --> 08:47.233
- No problem there.

08:49.133 --> 08:51.700
- Shall we go to lunch?

08:54.667 --> 08:56.267
- Vote
for Totally Harvard Bound.

08:56.267 --> 08:57.767
It's the best band name.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.767
Thanks.

08:59.767 --> 09:02.300
- Huh.
Wow. Great idea.

09:02.300 --> 09:04.067
You stayed up all night
baking cupcakes.

09:04.067 --> 09:06.867
- Oh, no, I make a batch every
week and keep it in my locker,

09:06.867 --> 09:09.233
you know, just in case.

09:09.233 --> 09:12.333
- She's got cupcakes.
We're doomed.

09:12.333 --> 09:14.967
- Where are you going?
- To get a cupcake.

09:14.967 --> 09:16.567
I'm doomed, not dieting.

09:16.567 --> 09:18.833
- Wait, dude.
This is serious.

09:18.833 --> 09:20.433
The vote's in an hour.

09:20.433 --> 09:21.967
If we don't team up
against Summer,

09:21.967 --> 09:23.133
we're going to be stuck

09:23.133 --> 09:25.233
with Totally Harvard Bound
forever.

09:25.233 --> 09:26.500
- Count me in.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.167
- If we want people
to vote for us,

09:28.167 --> 09:30.400
we've got to give them
something better than cupcakes.

09:30.400 --> 09:34.067
- How about
this irresistible smile?

09:34.067 --> 09:37.200
- We're trying to recruit kids,
not your mother.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.167
- I'll get ice cream.

09:40.900 --> 09:42.067
- Check it out.

09:42.067 --> 09:43.433
I sweet-talked
the lunch lady

09:43.433 --> 09:45.533
into giving me
extra tater tots.

09:45.533 --> 09:46.867
- Perfect.

09:46.867 --> 09:48.700
Free tater tots if you vote
for Smog Check!

09:48.700 --> 09:51.133
- Dude, do you know
how hard I had to flirt

09:51.133 --> 09:53.300
with Sylvia to get these?

09:53.300 --> 09:56.900
I have to play bingo
with her on Friday.

09:56.900 --> 10:00.133
- "Broseph," relax.
It's for Smog Check.

10:00.133 --> 10:02.700
- But they're mine!

10:02.700 --> 10:04.300
How do you know
I don't want to use these

10:04.300 --> 10:06.033
to get people
to vote for Timewarp?

10:06.033 --> 10:07.533
- That's hilarious, bro.

10:07.533 --> 10:09.667
Still pushing Timewarp.

10:09.667 --> 10:13.167
- Free tater tots
for Timewarpers.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.900
- Check out the tub.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.467
Lunch lady Sylvia
loves this smile...

10:19.467 --> 10:22.067
and I have to play bridge
with her on Thursday.

10:22.067 --> 10:23.467
- Yes!

10:23.467 --> 10:27.200
Free ice cream if you vote
for Smog Check!

10:27.200 --> 10:28.700
- Tots for Timewarp?

10:30.200 --> 10:32.100
Ah!

10:34.167 --> 10:36.100
Summer, what can I do
to get you to vote

10:36.100 --> 10:37.433
for Timewarp instead?

10:37.433 --> 10:38.867
- [scoffs]
Sorry, Lawrence,

10:38.867 --> 10:40.933
but if a name doesn't speak
to me on a creative level,

10:40.933 --> 10:42.467
I can't get behind it.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.867
- What if I change the name
to Summer and the Timewarps?

10:44.867 --> 10:46.400
- I'm in.
- Yes!

10:46.400 --> 10:48.633
Vote for
Summer and the Timewarps!

10:51.867 --> 10:55.467
- All right,
I trust you talked it out

10:55.467 --> 10:58.400
and agreed we're called
Paradoxx now.

10:58.400 --> 11:01.400
I suggest
you buy your T-shirts quickly.

11:01.400 --> 11:03.633
I only have 1,000 left.

11:03.633 --> 11:06.300
- We're not calling
ourselves Paradoxx.

11:06.300 --> 11:07.933
We're going with Smog Check.

11:07.933 --> 11:10.933
- No, we're going with
Summer and the Timewarps.

11:10.933 --> 11:13.967
- That wasn't even
one of the choices.

11:13.967 --> 11:16.467
- Alliances needed to be made,
Mr. Finn.

11:17.433 --> 11:19.400
- Summer and the Timewarps?

11:19.400 --> 11:21.967
Smog Check is so much more
hard core.

11:21.967 --> 11:23.967
It's about power
and cool

11:23.967 --> 11:26.600
and sensible
car maintenance.

11:26.600 --> 11:29.900
- Summer and the Timewarps
is about bending time and space.

11:29.900 --> 11:32.333
- Why can't you just go
along with me, Lawrence?

11:32.333 --> 11:33.800
I thought we were friends.

11:33.800 --> 11:36.633
- Friends don't mess
with another man's taters.

11:36.633 --> 11:39.633
- Fine.
Then maybe we're not friends.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.067
I renounce
my friendship to you.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.367
- I renounce my friendship
to you!

11:43.367 --> 11:45.233
And my renouncement
begins retroactively

11:45.233 --> 11:46.400
to your renouncement.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
- It's tater tots!

11:48.400 --> 11:49.900
- Guys, calm down.

11:49.900 --> 11:52.300
- You told us to get out
our frustrations, Mr. Finn.

11:52.300 --> 11:56.367
- Everybody,
put your frustrations back in.

11:56.367 --> 11:57.667
- Whoever wants to be
in Smog Check

11:57.667 --> 12:00.267
come to the front
of the class.

12:00.267 --> 12:02.567
- Calling all Timewarps.
Oh!

12:04.267 --> 12:07.333
- Guys, our first real gig
is in two days.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.967
We need to decide on a name,

12:08.967 --> 12:12.833
or we're gonna be called
The Princess Party Band.

12:12.833 --> 12:16.400
- We have our name, Mr. Finn.
We're Summer and the Timewarps.

12:16.400 --> 12:19.233
If they don't like it, they
don't have to be in our band.

12:19.233 --> 12:22.300
- We wouldn't be in your band
if you paid us.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.700
- Fine, two bands!
- Fine, two bands!

12:24.700 --> 12:27.300
all: [chanting]
Two bands, two bands!

12:27.300 --> 12:28.700
- One band, one band!

12:28.700 --> 12:31.200
I can't have
seven failed bands!

12:31.200 --> 12:34.333
[chanting continues]

12:38.633 --> 12:40.867
- * Tell me something new,
tell me something true *

12:40.867 --> 12:43.267
- Catchy song, isn't it?

12:43.267 --> 12:45.333
- Alison, uh...

12:45.333 --> 12:48.067
Shouldn't you be in the lower
school building right now?

12:48.067 --> 12:50.267
- I've got finger painting
in ten minutes,

12:50.267 --> 12:52.567
so let's get down
to business.

12:52.567 --> 12:53.933
I hear your band broke up.

12:53.933 --> 12:57.067
- What?
Where'd you hear that?

12:57.067 --> 13:00.067
- You don't get
the center cubbyhole

13:00.067 --> 13:02.733
without knowing
a few things, Mr. Finn.

13:02.733 --> 13:05.167
- Alison, please, don't worry.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.667
I've got it all under control.

13:06.667 --> 13:09.400
Come tomorrow,
everything will be fine.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.067
- I wasn't finished.

13:11.067 --> 13:14.767
It better be,
or I'm hiring Princess Oliviana,

13:14.767 --> 13:18.700
which means no cake for you.

13:20.733 --> 13:23.067
- Buck up, man.
She's seven years old.

13:24.367 --> 13:28.400
[playing guitar riff]

13:28.400 --> 13:30.367
- And then you do a solo.

13:30.367 --> 13:34.700
*

13:34.700 --> 13:36.267
And I do a solo.

13:36.267 --> 13:40.067
*

13:40.067 --> 13:43.300
- And then we turn on
the smog machine.

13:44.700 --> 13:46.667
And it does a solo.

13:46.667 --> 13:48.233
- Hey, guys,
I want to ask you something.

13:48.233 --> 13:49.967
Can you turn that off
for a sec?

13:49.967 --> 13:54.433
- Uh, I guess that wasn't
the off button.

13:54.433 --> 13:58.600
- Look, Alison wants Smog Check
to play her party--

13:58.600 --> 14:00.600
just you guys.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.267
- I don't know, Mr. Finn.

14:02.267 --> 14:04.133
Kids' parties aren't really
Smog Check's style.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.067
- Then again, it is a birthday,

14:06.067 --> 14:08.200
and we already
rented the machine.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.500
- I'm in!
- Cool!

14:10.500 --> 14:11.867
We'll do it, Mr. Finn.

14:11.867 --> 14:14.367
Mr. Finn?

14:14.367 --> 14:16.667
Freddy, he must've left
the room.

14:16.667 --> 14:19.800
Freddy?

14:19.800 --> 14:23.533
Freddy!

14:23.533 --> 14:27.367
- Summer and the Timewarps,
how's practice going?

14:27.367 --> 14:28.733
- Fantastic, Mr. Finn.

14:28.733 --> 14:30.167
I made the glitter costumes,

14:30.167 --> 14:32.367
and Tomika worked out
a killer dance.

14:32.367 --> 14:35.833
- Cool. What about,
you know, the music?

14:35.833 --> 14:38.367
- Oh, Lawrence is making...

14:38.367 --> 14:40.567
What did you call it,
Lawrence?

14:40.567 --> 14:42.100
- Oh, it's the ultimate

14:42.100 --> 14:45.067
automated keyboard/auto-tune/
drum machine trifecta.

14:45.067 --> 14:47.833
- You know, nerd music.

14:47.833 --> 14:49.300
- * Time warp, time warp

14:49.300 --> 14:51.333
* You have just been
time warped *

14:51.333 --> 14:53.800
* Time warp, time warp,
time warp *

14:53.800 --> 14:56.300
- It's all preprogrammed
so we don't even have to play--

14:56.300 --> 14:57.233
just dance.

14:57.233 --> 14:58.967
- Cool, show me your moves.

14:58.967 --> 15:01.167
- Oh, wait!

15:02.167 --> 15:03.933
Now you've done it.

15:03.933 --> 15:05.467
- Once he starts,
he doesn't stop.

15:05.467 --> 15:06.600
- I don't.

15:06.600 --> 15:08.267
- Listen, guys,

15:08.267 --> 15:10.400
Alison only wants one band
to play her party,

15:10.400 --> 15:13.133
and I told her you guys were
by far the better band.

15:13.133 --> 15:15.133
Think you could still
rock it for me?

15:15.133 --> 15:17.467
- You bet.
Our first gig.

15:17.467 --> 15:19.733
- That's great,
isn't it, Lawrence?

15:19.733 --> 15:22.167
- * Time warp, time warp

15:22.167 --> 15:25.500
Uh, I'm just gonna
take that as a yes.

15:27.067 --> 15:29.867
- Here we are,
living the rock 'n' roll life,

15:29.867 --> 15:32.600
playing for tough crowds
in dingy dives.

15:32.600 --> 15:35.133
Ooh, face-painting table.

15:35.133 --> 15:37.267
I'm gonna be
a bunny rabbit.

15:37.267 --> 15:40.067
- Hey.
What are you guys doing here?

15:40.067 --> 15:42.067
- We're here to rock the party.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.067
What's your excuse?
Did you come to watch?

15:44.067 --> 15:46.500
- No, Freddy and I
are playing this gig.

15:47.733 --> 15:49.167
Freddy?

15:49.167 --> 15:53.067
- Sorry, those face painters
are really aggressive.

15:55.067 --> 15:57.467
- Mr. Finn, what's going on?

15:57.467 --> 16:00.267
- Nothing weird.

16:00.267 --> 16:02.567
Just gathering dinner--

16:02.567 --> 16:03.600
meatballs.

16:03.600 --> 16:05.367
Ow!

16:05.367 --> 16:06.967
Toothpicks.

16:06.967 --> 16:09.333
- No, I mean,
why are we both here?

16:09.333 --> 16:11.667
- Yeah, you said
we were playing.

16:11.667 --> 16:12.733
Are you a mouse?

16:12.733 --> 16:15.100
- I'm a cat.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.400
[purrs, meows]

16:20.067 --> 16:23.067
Look, I lied to you guys
to get us back together.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.300
We got to start acting
like professionals

16:25.300 --> 16:28.500
and not let Alison know,
because if she finds out,

16:28.500 --> 16:30.633
we are--

16:30.633 --> 16:33.400
Hey, Alison.

16:33.400 --> 16:36.067
- Why is half your band
dressed in space suits?

16:36.067 --> 16:37.900
- We're
Summer and the Timewarps.

16:37.900 --> 16:40.667
- And we're Smog Check.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.133
- Two bands?
I want one band!

16:43.133 --> 16:45.933
You made me promises.

16:45.933 --> 16:49.500
One awesome band
and no mess-ups.

16:49.500 --> 16:51.533
- Is there a problem here,
Alison?

16:51.533 --> 16:54.133
- No, no problem,
Princess Oliviana.

16:54.133 --> 16:56.067
I hired the princess
as backup.

16:56.067 --> 16:58.067
She's taking your spot now.

16:58.067 --> 17:00.467
- Oh, you must be the band
I heard about.

17:00.467 --> 17:01.933
Oh, it's ever so nice
to meet you.

17:01.933 --> 17:05.400
Alison, dear, your little guests
are asking for you.

17:05.400 --> 17:08.067
Perhaps you should go grace them
with your presence.

17:08.067 --> 17:12.133
[giggles]

17:12.133 --> 17:13.767
All right,
here's the deal, pal.

17:13.767 --> 17:16.400
This is my show.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.800
You, the doofuses
and the glitter triplets

17:19.800 --> 17:22.900
think you can waltz on in here
and steal my thunder?

17:22.900 --> 17:24.633
This is a princess party.

17:24.633 --> 17:25.900
I'm a princess.

17:25.900 --> 17:28.500
- Not a real princess.

17:28.500 --> 17:30.600
I mean, that's not even
a real wand.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.333
- Oh, no?

17:34.800 --> 17:38.433
- Ow!
What is that, metal?

17:38.433 --> 17:41.933
- Now, unless you want to wear
my tiara the hard way,

17:41.933 --> 17:44.700
I suggest you all pack up
your little field trip

17:44.700 --> 17:46.067
and hit the road.

17:46.067 --> 17:48.700
You're out of your league,
mouse face.

17:48.700 --> 17:51.067
[giggles]

17:51.067 --> 17:53.267
- I am a cat.

17:53.267 --> 17:56.067
- Well, she's delightful.

17:56.067 --> 17:57.833
- This is all
your fault, Lawrence.

17:57.833 --> 17:59.833
If you would've just
voted for Smog Check,

17:59.833 --> 18:01.067
this would've never happened.

18:01.067 --> 18:02.700
- My fault?

18:02.700 --> 18:04.067
This ends now.

18:04.067 --> 18:06.400
Eat my glitter!
- Back off!

18:06.400 --> 18:09.100
I got a confetti cannon,
and I'm not afraid to use it!

18:09.100 --> 18:11.300
- Guys, stop.
You're better than this.

18:14.067 --> 18:15.633
That's it!

18:15.633 --> 18:20.267
I've been wanded,
"confettitied," and glittered.

18:20.267 --> 18:24.267
This is the worst princess party
I've ever been to.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.567
- I thought
we were "brosephs."

18:28.567 --> 18:31.633
- I never agreed
we'd call each other "brosephs."

18:31.633 --> 18:33.067
I hate "brosephs."

18:33.067 --> 18:35.467
You just expect me
to do whatever you want.

18:35.467 --> 18:37.433
I wanted to get
"Wormhole of Justice."

18:37.433 --> 18:39.833
- Wait. This is about
a video game?

18:39.833 --> 18:44.100
- No, it's about you
not caring about what I want...

18:44.100 --> 18:46.067
which in this case
is a video game.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.600
So, yes!

18:47.600 --> 18:50.467
- Guys, bands don't break up
because of video games.

18:50.467 --> 18:53.300
They break up
because of fame or money

18:53.300 --> 18:56.433
or really annoying princesses.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.367
- * Tell me something new,
tell me something true *

18:58.367 --> 19:01.800
* Can I be the princess
of your dreams? *

19:01.800 --> 19:04.833
- Okay, we may not agree
on a band name,

19:04.833 --> 19:07.433
or whether or not we can call
each other "broseph,"

19:07.433 --> 19:09.400
but we can agree
we're not gonna let

19:09.400 --> 19:11.067
some psycho, snotty,
fake princess

19:11.067 --> 19:14.567
steal our first gig, right?

19:14.567 --> 19:17.133
- * Tell me something new,
tell me something true *

19:17.133 --> 19:20.500
* Can I be the princess
of your dream? *

19:20.500 --> 19:22.100
*

19:22.100 --> 19:23.833
- Man, I hate that princess.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.400
- Me too.
- See?

19:25.400 --> 19:29.100
You guys aren't as far apart
as you think you are.

19:29.100 --> 19:30.433
- Mr. Finn's right.

19:30.433 --> 19:32.700
Lawrence,
you're my best friend.

19:32.700 --> 19:35.167
I should've paid more attention
to what you wanted.

19:35.167 --> 19:36.733
I'm sorry.

19:36.733 --> 19:39.900
- What I want is to get
this band back together.

19:39.900 --> 19:41.733
What do you say, "broseph"?

19:44.233 --> 19:46.867
- Let's show this princess
how to rock.

19:46.867 --> 19:48.800
all: Yeah!

19:48.800 --> 19:49.967
*

19:49.967 --> 19:51.333
- * I've heard it all *

19:51.333 --> 19:52.767
- What are we gonna play?

19:52.767 --> 19:55.533
- The only song
that'll get this crowd back.

19:55.533 --> 19:57.133
"Tell Me Something True"...

19:57.133 --> 19:59.267
the rock version.

19:59.267 --> 20:00.700
- Do you even know
the words, Mr. Finn?

20:00.700 --> 20:03.333
- Maybe.

20:03.333 --> 20:04.967
Freddy, give me a beat!

20:04.967 --> 20:07.833
both: * Tell me something new,
tell me something true *

20:07.833 --> 20:10.967
* Can I be the princess
of your dreams? *

20:10.967 --> 20:13.800
* Tell me something new,
are we coming true *

20:13.800 --> 20:17.233
* Or is this
another make-believe? *

20:17.233 --> 20:19.967
- * All I ever need

20:19.967 --> 20:22.167
* Is for you to look at me

20:22.167 --> 20:25.267
* The princess
of your dreams *

20:25.267 --> 20:28.500
* Oh oh

20:28.500 --> 20:31.700
* The princess of your dreams

20:31.700 --> 20:33.533
* Oh oh

20:33.533 --> 20:36.067
- Hello,
Alison's birthday party!

20:36.067 --> 20:40.033
We're a band that met at school,
and we like to rock.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.733
- We're School of Rock!

20:41.733 --> 20:43.233
*

20:43.233 --> 20:45.833
- That's the perfect name,
Lawrence.

20:45.833 --> 20:46.833
- Yeah!

20:46.833 --> 20:49.000
School of Rock, I love it!

20:49.000 --> 20:50.300
- I told you we'd get it.

20:50.300 --> 20:53.167
* All I ever need

20:53.167 --> 20:56.267
* Is for you to look at me

20:56.267 --> 20:58.300
* The princess
of your dreams *

20:58.300 --> 20:59.300
- Yeah! Yeah!

20:59.300 --> 21:02.200
Stage dive!

21:02.200 --> 21:05.667
I think I landed on her wand.

21:05.667 --> 21:10.667
*
