05:18.927 --> 05:20.363
I wouldn't go that way.

05:22.365 --> 05:27.065
Good evening. You have come
to steal from me tonight?

05:29.111 --> 05:31.896
I must apologize.

05:32.288 --> 05:37.598
He can be a little
overprotective at times.

05:42.254 --> 05:44.474
I am Herr Goodman.

05:44.953 --> 05:50.001
Please.
Shadows don't scare me anymore.

05:58.967 --> 06:00.447
-  That's better.

06:12.284 --> 06:15.200
What was it
you were hoping to find?

06:16.506 --> 06:19.509
Money? Jewels?

06:24.601 --> 06:25.602
My Tréhot?

06:27.256 --> 06:29.345
Ah, yes.

06:29.998 --> 06:34.829
A beautiful and priceless piece.

06:36.700 --> 06:37.832
I wonder,

06:38.267 --> 06:42.663
what is it that drives one
to... to risk freedom?

06:43.751 --> 06:44.969
Or even death?

06:46.928 --> 06:48.016
Come here.

06:50.061 --> 06:52.281
I promise
I will not hurt you, come.

06:56.633 --> 07:00.768
Does she, uh,
remind you of anyone?

07:05.033 --> 07:06.164
My mother.

07:10.255 --> 07:11.692
I see now.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.703
Do you know what that is?

07:25.836 --> 07:29.057
Your number... from the camps.

07:29.318 --> 07:32.756
Millions in the world
continue to deny it.

07:34.062 --> 07:37.369
I am pleased to hear
you acknowledge the truth.

07:38.719 --> 07:41.112
I knew I made the right choice.

07:42.026 --> 07:43.245
What do you mean?

07:45.595 --> 07:48.990
We are not too different,
you and I.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.255
We both know what it means to...

07:53.777 --> 07:57.128
to carry the suffering
of our ancestors,

07:58.695 --> 08:02.612
hatred of our eternal enemy.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.140
You may not take
the Renoir tonight,

08:09.489 --> 08:12.753
but you may come
and enjoy it anytime you like.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.190
On one condition.

08:19.063 --> 08:20.195
And what is that?

08:21.544 --> 08:24.504
Instead of stealing <i>from</i> me,

08:25.983 --> 08:30.031
you're going to steal... <i>for</i> me.

08:56.100 --> 08:57.232
Gentlemen.

08:59.103 --> 09:00.627
Why are you here?

09:01.192 --> 09:04.065
Oh, you know me.
I couldn't stay away.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.980
Retirement doesn't
really suit me.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.330
Have you tried gardening?

09:09.287 --> 09:11.072
A cruise, perhaps?

09:14.075 --> 09:16.512
You know, unless there
was a vote to remove me,

09:17.252 --> 09:20.560
I believe I'm still a member
of this organization.

09:20.777 --> 09:23.345
We should have voted you out
the moment you failed.

09:23.432 --> 09:24.738
I did what I had to do.

09:24.868 --> 09:27.175
That was not
your decision to make.

09:27.262 --> 09:28.480
You know damn well

09:28.568 --> 09:30.613
Josef would have
destroyed those paintings

09:30.744 --> 09:33.660
rather than see them stay
in the hands of Nazis.

09:34.225 --> 09:37.446
What I don't know
is what Josef ever saw in you

09:37.533 --> 09:38.839
in the first place.

09:39.796 --> 09:41.972
You've never belonged here.

09:42.320 --> 09:45.497
You can't ever understand.

09:51.286 --> 09:52.504
I'll ask again.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.641
Am I not... still the CEO...

10:00.730 --> 10:02.166
of this organization?

10:03.167 --> 10:04.342
Annabel.

10:05.648 --> 10:08.695
Welcome home, hmm?

10:10.087 --> 10:13.395
You look well.
Well, what brings you in?

10:14.004 --> 10:15.136
Alek.

10:16.572 --> 10:19.009
I found them.
I found all of them.

10:19.096 --> 10:20.663
-  What? Where?
- Yes.

10:21.098 --> 10:22.709
Here, they're in Los Angeles.

10:22.796 --> 10:25.363
Our resources
are no longer at your disposal.

10:25.494 --> 10:27.409
I'm not asking for permission.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.542
Oh, look, Annabel,
I want to honor Josef

10:30.630 --> 10:33.763
as much as you do,
but I'm afraid I have to agree.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.157
No, Alek, listen to me.
This is our chance to do

10:36.244 --> 10:38.202
everything Josef
wanted us to do.

10:38.289 --> 10:42.642
The world will not forgive
another failure.

10:43.207 --> 10:46.036
Oh, after what happened...

10:46.297 --> 10:50.432
...we must put our faith
and resources in the courts.

11:19.287 --> 11:21.768
When I first met Josef...

11:23.421 --> 11:25.772
we had just arrived at the camp.

11:27.643 --> 11:31.734
We were standing in line
for our numbers.

11:34.694 --> 11:40.917
We were only ten years old,
frightened and alone.

11:43.398 --> 11:46.096
Being tattooed by strangers.

11:48.969 --> 11:52.015
When the Americans freed us,

11:52.146 --> 11:55.366
we ran away
the first chance we got.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.674
We walked, we hiked, we rode

11:59.109 --> 12:01.503
for four nights back
to his home.

12:02.504 --> 12:07.901
All he could talk about
was getting back to this box.

12:12.993 --> 12:15.822
He was like a brother to me.

12:17.519 --> 12:19.390
A father to you.

12:20.304 --> 12:21.741
So you understand?

12:23.220 --> 12:25.135
I made a promise to Josef.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.402
One I plan on keeping.

12:35.319 --> 12:37.800
Tell us, Annabel,
what do you need?

12:50.378 --> 12:51.683
- So?

12:51.771 --> 12:52.946
They gave their full support.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.948
- No. Seriously?
- Yeah.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.080
Well, how'd you convince them
to trust you again?

12:57.777 --> 12:59.039
Not for you to worry about.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.345
Now, this is still
about stealing paintings

13:01.432 --> 13:02.956
- back from Nazis, right?
- Of course.

13:03.043 --> 13:04.305
The last time it got personal

13:04.392 --> 13:05.610
and shit went sideways
real fast.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.265
Like I said,
it's not for you to worry about.

13:08.352 --> 13:11.051
- Okay? Now, come on. Come on.
- Whoa, where are we going?

13:11.442 --> 13:12.617
We need intel.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.143
Please, not Lucille.
Don't say Lucille.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.014
Yes, we're gonna go
see Lucille.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.146
Come on.

13:44.519 --> 13:46.564
- I'm in.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.001
How are you in?

13:48.262 --> 13:50.177
This is the strongest
firewall we have.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.353
I don't know what to tell you.

13:53.006 --> 13:56.009
Backdoors,
buffer overflow vulnerabilities.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.707
Okay, great. How do we fix it?

14:00.404 --> 14:01.623
That's not my job.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.280
Okay. Do I need to remind you

14:06.628 --> 14:08.717
of the conditions
of your little work release?

14:10.153 --> 14:12.329
I'll run diagnostics

14:12.634 --> 14:14.679
and have a report to you
by tomorrow morning.

14:14.897 --> 14:16.464
Your lab rats
should be able to close

14:16.551 --> 14:18.118
most of the gaps
in the firewall.

14:25.429 --> 14:26.561
Hey, Luce.

14:30.043 --> 14:32.872
-  Eddie, I--
- How have you been?

14:33.611 --> 14:35.091
- You look good.
-  I...

14:36.353 --> 14:39.313
You clearly didn't understand
"Stay the hell away from me."

14:40.401 --> 14:42.142
- You're still mad at me?
- Wow, I--

14:42.620 --> 14:44.840
Wait a minute.
If you're here, that means...

14:46.146 --> 14:47.190
Hey, Lucille.

14:48.757 --> 14:49.801
How you been?

14:50.802 --> 14:52.239
Surviving.

14:52.848 --> 14:55.198
Good. I got a job for you.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.201
- I already have a job.
- What? Working for the feds?

14:58.288 --> 15:00.987
Yeah, well, it pays the bills
and keeps me out of jail.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.946
We pull this one off,
you'll be free and clear.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.774
It's the FBI.

15:05.861 --> 15:07.515
You don't just
make a phone call.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.691
Why do you think you're still
not in jail right now?

15:11.519 --> 15:12.912
Seriously?

15:13.129 --> 15:14.652
The Syndicate
still has connections

15:14.739 --> 15:17.612
in the state capital.
We'll be helping each other out.

15:18.091 --> 15:19.657
The only person
you've ever helped out

15:19.744 --> 15:20.876
is yourself.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.879
I... I'm not down to go through
that shit again with you two.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.186
- No, thank you.
- You really want to spend

15:26.273 --> 15:28.275
the next five to ten years
explaining shit to men

15:28.362 --> 15:31.234
who aren't even
half as smart as you, huh?

15:31.408 --> 15:33.323
Come on, Lucy, come on.

15:34.846 --> 15:36.065
You're better than that.

15:37.153 --> 15:39.329
- I need you, mama.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.070
I really need you.

15:44.856 --> 15:47.033
- Him too?
- I'll deal with him.

15:57.434 --> 16:00.350
- What are we stealing?
- A painting.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.744
- Four paintings.
- Wait, what?

16:02.874 --> 16:04.833
- Four?
- Four paintings. Come on.

16:05.181 --> 16:06.617
- Let's go.

16:07.575 --> 16:08.750
Four paintings?

16:11.796 --> 16:15.452
- So, who's the mark?
-  Otto Huizen.

16:16.149 --> 16:19.369
A German venture capitalist
whose investments are focused

16:19.456 --> 16:22.329
on trying to create
a neo-Nazi Fourth Reich.

16:23.504 --> 16:25.941
- Sounds like a piece of work.
-  Yeah, he's sadistic.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.248
And you're sure he has
all four paintings?

16:28.378 --> 16:29.597
Yeah.

16:33.296 --> 16:35.255
<i>Huizen recently
had a business meeting</i>

16:35.255 --> 16:36.647
<i>with Uriel Kantor.</i>

16:37.387 --> 16:39.868
- The Russian oligarch?
- Yup, that's him.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.089
After a few bottles of vodka,

16:43.089 --> 16:45.700
<i>they started trying to compare
whose billions were bigger.</i>

16:45.700 --> 16:47.571
<i>And priceless pieces
of artwork came to mind.</i>

16:47.571 --> 16:49.704
<i>Huizen was bragging
about missing paintings</i>

16:49.791 --> 16:51.184
only he gets to look at.

16:51.445 --> 16:54.578
A Russian and a Nazi.
What could go wrong?

16:55.188 --> 16:56.667
He's more than just a Russian.

16:57.842 --> 16:58.800
He's Jewish.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.672
<i>His uncles
were at Auschwitz,</i>

17:01.672 --> 17:03.979
<i>- same time as Josef.</i>

17:05.763 --> 17:08.244
- So what's the play?
-  Okay, I'm gonna spam

17:08.331 --> 17:10.942
his company's email server
with a weaponized PDF.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.380
I mean, it won't take long
for one of his idiot employees

17:13.510 --> 17:14.468
to click on it.

17:15.643 --> 17:17.297
And then the real fun begins.

17:45.281 --> 17:47.892
- Whoo! Got you!
-  Whoa, what the hell?

17:48.545 --> 17:50.634
- Got you.
-  You okay?

17:51.070 --> 17:54.160
- Oh, I am better than okay.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.554
Hook, line,
and sinker, baby. I...

17:59.034 --> 18:02.690
I now have access
to their network

18:03.125 --> 18:05.910
and their login credentials.

18:10.350 --> 18:11.568
And their network.

18:30.674 --> 18:33.199
-  So, uh...

18:34.765 --> 18:36.245
- You were saying, um...
- Yeah, I was say-- I'm in.

18:36.376 --> 18:38.334
I'm... I can see everything.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.945
- What's everything?
- Everything, everything.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.339
Um, emails,
banking info, purchase history,

18:43.426 --> 18:45.254
- browser history--
- Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.

18:45.385 --> 18:46.516
You... you can do that?

18:46.734 --> 18:49.215
You can, like,
see what websites he looks at?

18:49.432 --> 18:50.955
I... I could.

18:52.043 --> 18:53.480
That's a little scary.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.960
I bet he looks up
a lot of weird shit.

18:59.050 --> 19:01.140
What... what do you...
what do you mean?

19:01.227 --> 19:03.054
You know, rich guys like him,

19:03.142 --> 19:04.926
they all got
their freaky shit they're into.

19:05.013 --> 19:06.797
You know,
I bet he looks up some, uh,

19:07.407 --> 19:09.757
like, bondage, S type shit
or something.

19:10.018 --> 19:13.195
Oh. Well,
if you think that's freaky,

19:13.282 --> 19:16.067
then you need
to get out more often.

19:17.547 --> 19:18.766
Oh, yeah?

19:19.332 --> 19:21.160
Well, that doesn't sound like
the Lucy I remember.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.813
Hmm, if you only knew.

19:23.510 --> 19:25.642
Okay, now get out of here.
You're making me hot.

19:25.773 --> 19:27.253
- Like I'm hot, I'm hot.
- I knew it, I know.

19:27.383 --> 19:28.428
Go, please.

19:34.869 --> 19:36.392
Hey, hey.

19:36.392 --> 19:38.046
<i>Hey, I gotta make this quick.</i>

19:38.046 --> 19:39.961
<i>So, one of his dumbass lackeys
clicked on the fake file.</i>

19:39.961 --> 19:41.658
<i>It transmitted
identifying packets</i>

19:41.658 --> 19:43.573
<i>that I ran through
a decryption program,</i>

19:43.573 --> 19:44.922
<i>I pwned his network.</i>

19:44.922 --> 19:46.533
-  You what?
-  <i>It... it means</i>

19:46.620 --> 19:48.099
I made it my own. I own it.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.058
Any security systems
will be online

19:50.058 --> 19:52.669
<i>and I'll be able to disable
and intercept any alarms.</i>

19:52.669 --> 19:55.933
<i>- All right, I gotta go, bye.</i>
-  Hey, good work.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.936
Now, let's go
steal us some blueprints.

20:04.899 --> 20:07.336
Welcome, I'm Victoria.
What can we design for you?

20:07.423 --> 20:08.946
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

20:09.077 --> 20:11.253
This is my assistant, Nathan,

20:11.340 --> 20:13.647
and we're looking
to build a new weekend house

20:13.777 --> 20:14.822
on the Northern Coast.

20:14.909 --> 20:15.997
Excellent, if you'll follow me,

20:16.084 --> 20:17.738
we can head back
to our conference room

20:17.868 --> 20:19.218
and take a look
at a few designs.

20:19.305 --> 20:20.262
Thank you.

20:25.136 --> 20:28.270
Excuse me, Victoria?
Is there a washroom I may use?

20:28.401 --> 20:30.141
Of course, just down
this hallway and to the right.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.534

21:44.259 --> 21:45.216
I thought I'd take a tour,
you know?

21:45.304 --> 21:46.392
Seems like a nice place to work.

21:46.479 --> 21:47.610
We don't have time for that!

21:47.915 --> 21:49.264
- Did you get what we need?
- I got lost. Yeah, yeah.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.533
We got a problem.

21:57.707 --> 22:00.057
I've been going through
his emails, invoices.

22:00.144 --> 22:03.278
Huizen has a safe technician
to the house every six months.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.194
So, I started searching
for other similar purchases

22:06.368 --> 22:10.372
and found that he owns
a Gateway Super Defender TRX.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.461
It's one of the best
home safes out there.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.681
We need a locksmith.

22:14.768 --> 22:15.856
Well, there's more.

22:16.509 --> 22:18.902
The security cameras
around the house are IP cameras.

22:18.989 --> 22:20.991
I've been streaming
the feeds of each one.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.428
I've counted no less than

22:22.558 --> 22:24.255
half a dozen guards
on the property.

22:26.214 --> 22:27.607
We're gonna need a wildcard too.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.435
- Really? You sure?
-  Yeah. Definitely.

22:29.522 --> 22:30.740
What about Ricky?

22:30.871 --> 22:33.352
Not up for parole
for another... 18 months.

22:34.396 --> 22:36.442
- Max?
- Got out, retired.

22:39.749 --> 22:40.750

22:41.185 --> 22:43.753

23:05.732 --> 23:07.124
Don't tell me
you locked your keys in the car.

23:07.516 --> 23:08.735
Well, hello to you too.

23:11.520 --> 23:12.434
What do you want?

23:12.739 --> 23:14.218
Looks like
you could use a little

23:14.610 --> 23:16.351
excitement in your life
right now.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.527
- Excitement?
-  Mm-hmm.

23:19.223 --> 23:21.487
I have all the excitement
I need right here.

23:23.010 --> 23:25.142
Mm-hmm. How about a challenge?

23:26.709 --> 23:28.885
I've known you
for a very long time.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.147
Mm-hmm.

23:30.365 --> 23:33.237
And you know damn well
you can't challenge me.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.022
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:36.023 --> 23:38.460
How about
a Gateway Super Defender.

23:38.634 --> 23:42.159
Residential, heavily guarded,
high stakes.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.814
Five, ten minutes tops.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.991
That safe is
20 man-hours resistant

23:48.078 --> 23:49.906
and you want me to break into it
in under ten minutes?

23:49.993 --> 23:50.907
Yup.

23:51.560 --> 23:52.996
- Is that right?
-  Mm-hmm.

23:55.042 --> 23:57.218
I guess Eddie's gonna have
to take a crack at it, huh?

23:58.219 --> 23:59.873
- Eddie?
- Hmm.

24:00.264 --> 24:03.964
How about you don't come
into my shop and insult me.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.488

25:17.124 --> 25:19.735

Not yet.
Still with my same crew.

25:32.618 --> 25:35.490
Yeah.
Always play second fiddle,

25:35.577 --> 25:36.926

too long.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.624
Thanks for the career advice.

25:39.712 --> 25:40.626
You in?

25:41.757 --> 25:44.630
Whose ass I gotta kick, huh?

25:45.369 --> 25:49.243
Okay, so, Huizen's property
is set up like a compound.

25:49.330 --> 25:50.505
It sits right on the water

25:50.723 --> 25:52.420
and we're gonna
take advantage of that, okay?

25:52.768 --> 25:53.943
We're gonna moor here,

25:54.335 --> 25:56.380
and these rocks shouldn't
be difficult to get up.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.513
Oh, why... by the water?

25:58.731 --> 26:00.515
I mean, why not
just approach on foot?

26:00.646 --> 26:01.864
Well, the back patio

26:01.995 --> 26:03.344
is the least guarded side
of the house.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.041
There are two guards

26:05.128 --> 26:06.913
at the front door
around the clock,

26:07.043 --> 26:08.305
two guards in the driveway,

26:08.392 --> 26:10.046
and another guard
inside the house

26:10.133 --> 26:11.308
that roams the first floor.

26:11.395 --> 26:13.659
A fourth one
takes care of the back patio

26:13.746 --> 26:15.574
about every 35 or 45 minutes.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.925
If we time it right, we can
get in the house undetected.

26:19.229 --> 26:21.188
Assume
there's sliding patio doors?

26:21.318 --> 26:23.320
Yep. We see them
in the main floor camera

26:23.407 --> 26:25.540
- and the back patio camera.
-  Nadia?

26:25.975 --> 26:28.630
Sliding glass doors usually
have a mortise bolt lock.

26:29.152 --> 26:30.327
Easy to get into,

26:30.414 --> 26:31.807
but I'll be ready
for anything heavier.

26:31.894 --> 26:33.026
Okay, good.

26:33.330 --> 26:35.245
Once in, we have to subdue
the first floor guard.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.596
Hmm. Leave that to me.

26:37.857 --> 26:39.902
We just need him
incapacitated, not hurt.

26:40.163 --> 26:41.600
How do you expect me
to drop someone

26:41.687 --> 26:43.645
without hurting him?
Just a tiny bit.

26:43.776 --> 26:44.951
- I mean...
- A little bit.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.344
I... I can do it.
I know a little jujitsu.

26:47.693 --> 26:49.825
-  A little?
- Yeah.

26:49.999 --> 26:52.175
-  Well, congratulations.
- Can you do it?

26:52.480 --> 26:54.351
- I think I can handle it.
- All right.

26:54.787 --> 26:56.527
We'll find the safe
and then Nadia will be up.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.138
Uh, what about Huizen?

26:58.355 --> 27:00.880
We hit the house
when he's not home. Luce?

27:00.967 --> 27:03.883
Yeah, his secretary
keeps his calendar in the cloud.

27:03.970 --> 27:05.885
He'll be in San Francisco
next weekend.

27:06.102 --> 27:08.235
- Just the guards will be there.
- We could be in and out

27:08.365 --> 27:10.411
without any of the other guards
ever knowing we were there.

27:10.498 --> 27:14.023
Then it's set. Lucille
will disable the alarm from here

27:14.502 --> 27:16.112
and override
all the camera feed,

27:16.199 --> 27:17.853
creating a new loop
of clean feed.

27:18.767 --> 27:21.465
Wait a second. You're coming?

27:22.292 --> 27:24.773
Yeah, I'm coming.
Why shouldn't I?

27:25.382 --> 27:26.645
Uh...

27:27.254 --> 27:29.430
Oh, I don't know.

27:29.604 --> 27:32.868
- Um, it's just, uh, um...

27:33.826 --> 27:35.305
What?
'Cause she's a woman?

27:35.392 --> 27:37.699
Um, it's just that...

27:37.960 --> 27:39.832
- Wow. Um...
- Don't look at me, man,

27:39.919 --> 27:41.094
you're digging
your own grave here.

27:41.224 --> 27:43.836
- Yeah, okay.
- Okay, you... you're funny.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.708
You're real funny, bro,
but, um, I've been waiting

27:46.795 --> 27:48.492
on this score for a long time,
so there's no way

27:48.579 --> 27:50.103
I'm gonna be
missing it, okay? So...

27:50.669 --> 27:52.279
No, hey, uh, it's cool.

27:52.409 --> 27:53.541
It's awesome. Love it.

27:53.976 --> 27:55.804
I don't have to be the fastest.
I just gotta outrun you.

27:55.891 --> 27:58.459
Oh, even in heels,
you can't outrun me, okay?

27:58.546 --> 27:59.634
So, yeah.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.331
-  All right.

28:01.418 --> 28:02.550
Back to work.

28:18.522 --> 28:20.699
- Annabel.

28:25.616 --> 28:27.227
Get my fucking purse!

28:29.882 --> 28:31.013
Let's go...

28:42.242 --> 28:45.375
- Ah, Miss Gomez.

28:48.509 --> 28:50.511
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

28:51.599 --> 28:52.905
Please, sit.

28:57.170 --> 28:58.214
Do you know

28:58.388 --> 29:00.782
there's an actual bounty
on your head?

29:01.914 --> 29:03.916
- The Kerrs?
- Yeah.

29:04.177 --> 29:08.529
Seems retribution is the price
for their destroyed Monet.

29:09.008 --> 29:10.661
- How much?
- The Monet?

29:11.010 --> 29:13.273
-  The bounty?
- Half million.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.755
- Coffee?
-  No, thank you.

29:19.888 --> 29:20.846
Tell me.

29:21.977 --> 29:24.980
Why destroy such a priceless
piece of artwork?

29:25.067 --> 29:27.243
You know who the Kerrs are
and where they're from.

29:27.722 --> 29:30.812
Ah, so, their ideology
gives you the right

29:30.899 --> 29:33.554
to take and destroy
what is theirs?

29:33.641 --> 29:35.425
It's not theirs, it was stolen.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.992
- Really?
-  Yeah.

29:37.166 --> 29:38.472
From whom? When?

29:38.777 --> 29:40.953
It was taken
from the Rosenbaum family

29:41.040 --> 29:44.086
during the Nazi plunder
of France. Sound familiar?

29:44.260 --> 29:46.785
- Never heard of such a thing.
-  No?

29:47.960 --> 29:50.397
What about the execution
of six million Jews?

29:50.484 --> 29:52.486
I bet you've never heard
of that either, huh?

29:52.660 --> 29:54.749
I should turn you over
to the Kerrs right now

29:54.836 --> 29:56.098
and collect the bounty.

29:56.185 --> 29:57.708
So, what are you waiting for?

29:57.926 --> 30:01.103
I take pleasure in watching you

30:01.364 --> 30:04.019
chase after things
you cannot have,

30:04.193 --> 30:05.804
things that are not yours.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.893
You're right. They're not mine.

30:08.023 --> 30:10.896
They belong to the world
and I'm gonna give them back.

30:10.983 --> 30:12.419
I'm gonna give them all back.

30:12.506 --> 30:13.942
- Even yours.

30:14.682 --> 30:16.249
You can't possibly believe that.

30:16.858 --> 30:21.602
You will never get my paintings.
The world is not worthy of them.

30:22.385 --> 30:27.173
Only a superior people
deserve such fine art.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.958
Oh. Well.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.744
When you're ready
to collect on that bounty,

30:33.875 --> 30:35.181
you know where to find me.

30:40.839 --> 30:45.191
Your arrogance intrigues me.
Come for my paintings.

30:46.148 --> 30:49.848
And then you fail,
then I'll collect the bounty.

30:50.631 --> 30:51.675
Till then.

30:53.939 --> 30:55.114
Excuse me.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.252
-  Hey.
- Hey.

31:03.339 --> 31:04.384
We need to talk.

31:07.169 --> 31:08.170
Are you okay?

31:08.301 --> 31:09.868
- What happened in there?
- I'm fine.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.263
The Kerrs are on me.

31:14.524 --> 31:16.222
They want payback
for destroying the Monet.

31:16.352 --> 31:17.266
Shit!

31:20.226 --> 31:21.314
And now he knows we're coming.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.533
Relax, okay? I got this.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.188
He showed his hand.

31:26.275 --> 31:28.103
He has the paintings,
we stick to the plan.

31:28.625 --> 31:30.584
Jesus, what are we walking
into here, Annie?

31:31.063 --> 31:32.368
Just be straight with me.

31:33.282 --> 31:35.154
Is this just another
Syndicate job?

31:35.415 --> 31:38.287
- What paintings are we stealing?

31:40.637 --> 31:43.423
A Monet, a Degas,
Picasso, and a Van Gogh.

31:43.510 --> 31:47.557
Fuck. I knew it.
Josef's paintings.

31:49.516 --> 31:51.039
We've been through
some shit, Annie,

31:51.474 --> 31:54.042
and God knows I owe you,

31:54.129 --> 31:55.739
but I ain't ready
to die for some paintings.

31:56.088 --> 31:59.004
Well, I'm not sorry
because I made a promise.

31:59.091 --> 32:00.875
A promise
that I'm willing to die for.

32:01.397 --> 32:02.877
You know you gotta
sit this one out now.

32:02.964 --> 32:04.487
- No, no way.
- Annabel, you've been made--

32:04.574 --> 32:06.272
-  No! No.
-  You've been made

32:06.359 --> 32:07.926
and it's the only way
we move forward.

32:16.586 --> 32:17.892
We decided
it would be better off

32:17.979 --> 32:19.328
if Annabel didn't come along.

32:21.461 --> 32:22.984
Why the sudden change?

32:23.506 --> 32:26.640
Look, we can't take any chances
on this one, okay?

32:27.380 --> 32:29.773
We think it's best
if I make the plays from here,

32:29.991 --> 32:31.297
keep eyes and ears
on everything,

32:31.427 --> 32:33.255
and if something goes south,
I can bail you out.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.605
Okay,
but what's the backup plan?

32:36.389 --> 32:37.390
Lucille?

32:38.826 --> 32:39.783
Yeah.

32:40.871 --> 32:41.785
Uh...

32:43.135 --> 32:44.266
I can... I can do it.

32:46.921 --> 32:51.186
No, okay, I can do
Annabel's part and mine.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.885
Thanks though, sweetheart.
I appreciate the team effort.

33:04.547 --> 33:06.027
-  Holy shit!
-  Damn!

33:06.288 --> 33:07.768
- Look at him!

33:07.855 --> 33:09.074
- I can get--
- I said I got it.

33:09.204 --> 33:12.729
- I could get--
- There you go. Good job, mama.

33:12.903 --> 33:14.209
All right, come on,
stop fucking around.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.559
Let's go. Focus.
That was good, mama.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.735
Show him you can
kick his ass, that's right.

33:40.975 --> 33:42.933
So, you think
she can handle it?

33:44.587 --> 33:45.980
Yeah, absolutely.

33:49.679 --> 33:50.811
You know, I understand

33:51.116 --> 33:52.726
what these paintings
mean to you.

33:54.119 --> 33:55.424
No, I don't think you do.

33:57.731 --> 33:58.732
I was 18.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.692
Living in the streets,
stealing everything I could

34:02.779 --> 34:05.913
that wasn't nailed to the floor
just to survive.

34:10.135 --> 34:11.310
I was good at it.

34:15.096 --> 34:16.924
And I'd heard
about this old Jewish guy

34:17.011 --> 34:19.100
that had a stash of cash
in the safe.

34:21.711 --> 34:22.973
I went there to steal it.

34:24.714 --> 34:26.412
And hanging on the wall
in the office

34:26.499 --> 34:28.066
was this painting, this...

34:30.459 --> 34:33.288
It was a Renoir.
It was beautiful. I was...

34:34.202 --> 34:36.726
I was just mesmerized by this,

34:36.944 --> 34:38.946
the beauty of this woman
in this painting.

34:39.033 --> 34:41.644
It was just visceral
and so powerful to me.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.038
Did you steal it?

34:46.258 --> 34:47.433
No.

34:49.043 --> 34:50.218
Josef caught you?

34:51.567 --> 34:52.612
Josef saved me.

34:53.743 --> 34:56.094
I don't know how,
but he planned the whole thing.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.671
Josef was like a father to me.

35:09.933 --> 35:12.153
He was my mentor.
He taught me everything I know.

35:14.982 --> 35:16.679
He believed
he could heal the world

35:16.766 --> 35:18.420
of all its pain through art

35:19.073 --> 35:20.857
and he wanted
to give back all the beauty

35:20.944 --> 35:22.685
that was stolen by the Nazis.

35:32.086 --> 35:33.435
You think it'll still work?

35:38.875 --> 35:42.749
Those four paintings
belonged to Josef's family

35:42.879 --> 35:44.794
and he spent his whole life
searching for them,

35:44.881 --> 35:46.622
so it has to work.

35:47.710 --> 35:49.930
This is the only chance
we're gonna get, Eddie.

35:53.325 --> 35:54.804
We got a big problem.

36:01.985 --> 36:03.291
Lucille, what's going on?

36:03.422 --> 36:04.727
They're--

36:04.858 --> 36:06.120
- What?
- They're hack-backing me.

36:06.207 --> 36:07.469
They're... they're
hacking my system.

36:07.556 --> 36:08.775
Who could
possibly be hacking you?

36:08.862 --> 36:09.906
Okay, so what can we do?

36:10.080 --> 36:11.256
Should we pull the plug
or something?

36:11.343 --> 36:12.822
No, no, no, no, no.
If we do that,

36:12.996 --> 36:14.172
I... I'll never know who it was,

36:14.259 --> 36:15.434
what they've seen,
what they've taken.

36:15.521 --> 36:16.957
- What if you tried--

36:17.087 --> 36:19.438
Everyone just needs
to shut up and let me work.

36:22.441 --> 36:24.573
That's it.
Yeah, I-- They've...

36:24.704 --> 36:26.706
-  What's happening?
- Shit, I'm... I'm locked out.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.055
- They've...
-  What?

36:28.142 --> 36:29.926
They...
they changed everything.

36:30.231 --> 36:31.885
They're onto us.
They know we're coming.

36:31.972 --> 36:33.060
How?

36:33.147 --> 36:35.149
Fuck. Fuck!

36:40.676 --> 36:41.808
Annabel!

37:57.884 --> 37:58.972
Josef.

37:59.538 --> 38:02.758
I'm so sorry.

38:11.463 --> 38:12.812
Nice.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.693
-  Eat.
- Okay, bro. Uh...

38:25.607 --> 38:27.435
Are you gonna... you gonna
hurry up a little bit?

38:27.522 --> 38:30.873
I gotta check my email.
I gotta update my blog.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.832
- You know, I got followers...
- Hey, Luce?

38:33.963 --> 38:35.313
Am I reading this right?

38:37.924 --> 38:40.318
Yeah. Yeah,
those are the invoices.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.581
I thought you said
you were locked out.

38:42.885 --> 38:44.670
No, I am,
that's just from the data mine

38:44.757 --> 38:46.280
I did of their servers
and cloud.

38:46.846 --> 38:48.587
What's "Safe Domains"?

38:48.717 --> 38:51.329
That's the company that
services the safe at the house.

38:55.898 --> 38:57.030
Hold on a second.

38:57.160 --> 38:59.728
The invoices are dated
two days ago.

39:01.991 --> 39:04.646
Wait, the service
wasn't done at the house,

39:04.777 --> 39:07.345
it was done
at a different address.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.782
Do you think
he moved the paintings?

39:09.956 --> 39:11.392
I mean, it would make sense to.

39:11.479 --> 39:13.002
If he knew
we knew where they were.

39:13.133 --> 39:14.917
Yeah, there's the threat of us
alerting the authorities...

39:15.004 --> 39:16.441
-  Guys.
- ...and a guy like Huizen

39:16.528 --> 39:18.094
- would be threatened by that...
-  Guys.

39:18.225 --> 39:19.269
...he'd need something bigger.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.314
- Guys!
- What?

39:21.010 --> 39:23.970
A moving company specializing
in the crating and packaging

39:24.057 --> 39:26.364
of fine arts
was at the house the next day.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.063
- Where's the address?
- Right here in downtown L.A.

39:30.237 --> 39:34.415
What? Oh, my God!
Yes! Yes.

39:34.502 --> 39:36.896
Good job.
Nadia, we're in business, baby.

39:36.983 --> 39:38.680
- Yes!
- We got some work to do.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.290
- All right!
- Good. Good.

39:40.465 --> 39:41.857
'Cause I was this close

39:41.988 --> 39:44.164
- to finding myself another team.

39:44.294 --> 39:46.906
Can I check my, uh,
email, update my blog?

39:47.602 --> 39:48.690
You good?

39:49.517 --> 39:51.345
- No? I can do it later.

40:04.619 --> 40:09.015
Annabel. I just...
I... I just wanted to apologize.

40:09.276 --> 40:11.844
I... I don't know how
they found me in their network.

40:12.018 --> 40:13.498
- I don't blame you.

40:13.628 --> 40:14.977
- Lucy, it wasn't your fault.
- I just...

40:15.064 --> 40:16.675
- What are you doing?
- I don't know what happened.

40:16.762 --> 40:18.416
They should've never known
I was there.

40:19.329 --> 40:21.767
Lucy, don't worry about it.
We're gonna be okay, all right?

40:21.897 --> 40:23.072
- Come on, Annabel.
- Yo.

40:23.159 --> 40:24.509
- Seriously? What the hell?
- Leave it alone.

40:24.596 --> 40:25.684
- It's fine.
- Oh, fuck that.

40:25.771 --> 40:27.512
You can't let her think
she messed up.

40:27.599 --> 40:29.296
- It wasn't her fault.
- Yo, you guys want tacos...

40:29.383 --> 40:31.037
- It's not gonna help.
- Bullshit.

40:31.254 --> 40:33.300
Her confidence is shaken
and we need her solid.

40:33.387 --> 40:35.737
Since when the fuck do you give
a shit about her feelings?

40:35.824 --> 40:37.783
All right, someone tell me
what the hell is going on

40:37.870 --> 40:38.958
right now or I walk.

40:39.654 --> 40:41.221
- They didn't find you, Lucille.
- Don't.

40:42.004 --> 40:44.267
- They found her.
- What?

40:44.703 --> 40:46.226
She was made two days ago.

40:46.966 --> 40:48.707
- Huizen cornered her.

40:48.794 --> 40:50.926
There's a bounty on her head
for the last job we botched.

40:51.361 --> 40:54.452
Oh! That's why
you're not coming.

40:54.539 --> 40:56.279
- Lucy, wait.
-  Annabel, what the fuck?

40:56.366 --> 40:58.891
I thought this job was gonna be
different than the last.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.550
I told you nothing good
would come out of that.

41:11.512 --> 41:12.644
You people are crazy.

41:13.862 --> 41:14.994
Luce.

41:15.211 --> 41:17.823
- Luce, slow down. Hey.

41:19.215 --> 41:20.303
Can you wait up?

41:21.000 --> 41:23.002
- Luce? What--
- What are you doing?

41:24.046 --> 41:27.659
- Please come back.
-  Come back, wow, okay.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.705
- Okay.
- I... I need a minute.

41:31.010 --> 41:33.099
- Okay, let's... let's take one.

41:34.927 --> 41:35.971
I, uh...

41:41.107 --> 41:43.936
You...
You broke me, Eddie.

41:46.416 --> 41:48.984
- You broke me.
- I know, I'm...

41:50.595 --> 41:51.552
I'm sorry.

41:53.336 --> 41:55.382
I was scared
and I wasn't ready--

41:55.513 --> 41:56.775
Okay, cut the bullshit.

41:56.949 --> 42:00.039
Look, there's...
there's nothing I can say

42:01.257 --> 42:03.651
right now that's gonna make
anything better, okay?

42:05.784 --> 42:07.307
When Annabel
wanted to come get you,

42:07.394 --> 42:08.917
I... I didn't fight her.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.137
Okay? I didn't fight her.
I...

42:11.267 --> 42:13.661
I thought
that if I saw you again...

42:15.010 --> 42:17.883
...I thought
that I could make things right.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.234
But this... is bigger than us.

42:22.496 --> 42:24.367
- And we can't do it without you.

42:25.717 --> 42:27.414
- You know, I-- God, I...
-  What?

42:27.501 --> 42:29.547
- I knew I couldn't trust her.
-  Hey.

42:31.113 --> 42:32.158
You can trust me.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.511
Yeah, well, I hope you're right.

42:56.748 --> 42:57.705
Lucille.

42:59.794 --> 43:00.839
I'm sorry.

43:02.580 --> 43:03.581
So sorry.

43:04.625 --> 43:05.844
I, um...

43:08.498 --> 43:10.979
I want to apologize
to all of you. I...

43:12.764 --> 43:16.028
This job is not like
any other job.

43:17.246 --> 43:19.945
Each one of you
is the best at what you do.

43:20.032 --> 43:23.470
I chose you. I chose you.

43:26.647 --> 43:29.302
We're trying to right
a wrong against humanity

43:29.389 --> 43:32.000
and Josef believed that
and I believe that.

43:32.827 --> 43:35.525
And I'm putting my faith
and trust in each of you.

43:36.526 --> 43:39.442
You're my team. I need you.

43:40.530 --> 43:42.010
I can't do this without you.

43:47.276 --> 43:49.975
Okay. Okay, I'll stay.

43:51.933 --> 43:52.934
We're still here.

43:56.764 --> 43:57.635
Nadia?

43:59.288 --> 44:03.771
I'm in. Just... don't hide
anything from us anymore, okay?

44:04.293 --> 44:05.381
Please.

44:08.558 --> 44:11.692
I mean, look, that...

44:13.172 --> 44:15.827
Killer speech. Killer speech.

44:16.697 --> 44:19.047
Now, I hate Nazis
as much as the next guy,

44:19.134 --> 44:21.310
but, um...

44:21.484 --> 44:24.444
...how much are these
paintings actually worth?

44:24.792 --> 44:27.273
- They're priceless.
-  Priceless?

44:28.274 --> 44:32.626
Wow, I mean, that's...
that's a pretty big payday, no?

44:32.931 --> 44:35.847
Well, you're already being
compensated pretty generously.

44:35.934 --> 44:39.677
Right, but,
by the sounds of it,

44:40.939 --> 44:43.463
<i>priceless,</i>
could be a whole lot more, no?

44:43.550 --> 44:44.986
Well, that's not
what this is about.

44:47.032 --> 44:49.469
Does anybody else
feel like this?

44:50.688 --> 44:52.733
- Huh?
- No, I'm good.

44:53.952 --> 44:55.693
- Okay.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.305
Oh, so, it's just... just me.

44:59.871 --> 45:02.961
All right, never mind.
We're good.

45:07.008 --> 45:09.707
So, the building
has IP cameras all over,

45:09.794 --> 45:10.925
inside and out.

45:11.099 --> 45:13.885
Here we go.
There's one right here, here.

45:14.189 --> 45:16.583
Um. Won't they catch you
hacking into the system?

45:16.670 --> 45:18.803
Not this time.
I've doubled the number of times

45:18.933 --> 45:21.153
I've rerouted,
as well as doubled my layers.

45:21.240 --> 45:23.155
It'll take them forever
to find me this time.

45:23.242 --> 45:26.332
Plus, I'm not in their network.
I'm just watching the cameras.

45:26.506 --> 45:29.335
- You haven't pwned 'em again?
- Funny. No.

45:30.075 --> 45:32.120
- Uh. So, so far I've counted

45:32.251 --> 45:34.253
at least ten different guards.

45:34.340 --> 45:36.037
That's more than double
what was at the house.

45:36.124 --> 45:38.648
Not only is that more,
these guys are dangerous.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.302
I've done some
facial recognition

45:40.389 --> 45:41.782
and most of these guys
are in the system.

45:41.869 --> 45:43.305
- Ex-cons?
-  Worse.

45:43.392 --> 45:48.223
Ex-KSK, Kommando Special Kraft.
German special forces.

45:49.355 --> 45:51.052
The more the merrier,
if you ask me.

45:51.618 --> 45:53.098
Easy. The minute
one of those guards

45:53.185 --> 45:54.534
sounds the alarm, we're screwed.

45:54.621 --> 45:57.232
Okay, so,
not a standard smash-and-grab?

45:57.319 --> 45:59.495
No, it's not.
Not this time. Uh-uh.

46:00.279 --> 46:02.063
So, how are we gonna get in?

46:02.585 --> 46:04.979
Here. This garage door.

46:07.852 --> 46:09.201
Serve it special delivery?

46:09.288 --> 46:11.725
Yeah. Shell game on the way out.

46:12.334 --> 46:13.901
Okay, that works.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.469
But I think
we're gonna need more.

46:16.991 --> 46:18.253
What do you mean?

46:18.340 --> 46:20.429
Well, I mean,
we're going by assumption here.

46:20.516 --> 46:22.214
He could be playing us.
This could be a trap.

46:22.736 --> 46:23.911
We need confirmation.

46:24.694 --> 46:26.479
What do you think, Luce?
Can you get us anything more?

46:26.566 --> 46:28.786
Well, I'm not
in his network anymore,

46:28.873 --> 46:30.570
but I've got an idea.

46:30.744 --> 46:32.615
- Who you calling?

46:32.702 --> 46:34.269
A girlfriend
who owes me a favor.

46:34.704 --> 46:36.184
Yeah, would... would I like her?

46:39.884 --> 46:41.668
- Stupid.

47:19.010 --> 47:20.576
I've never seen you here before.

47:20.663 --> 47:22.317
Oh, we come here all the time.

47:22.448 --> 47:24.667
No. I come here all the time.

47:25.581 --> 47:26.974
I'm sure I would have seen

47:27.105 --> 47:29.629
two such beautiful creatures
such as yourself.

47:29.716 --> 47:31.457
Oh, you got me.

47:31.587 --> 47:34.764
This is our first time,
but a friend told me

47:34.852 --> 47:36.679
that these were
the best martinis in L.A.,

47:36.810 --> 47:38.377
so, we had to try them.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.901
Ah. I heard they do the trick.

47:41.032 --> 47:42.424
-  Yes!

47:45.688 --> 47:47.429
- Who's your friend?
-  Hmm.

47:47.995 --> 47:51.999
This is Francesca and I'm Angie.

47:52.478 --> 47:54.915
Ah. It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

47:57.787 --> 48:01.356
- And you are, mister...
- Oh, please. You call me Otto.

48:01.574 --> 48:08.450
Otto? That is an adorable name
for such a powerful-looking man.

48:08.581 --> 48:11.453
-  Mm-hmm.
- Otto, maybe you can help us

48:11.540 --> 48:13.194
settle a disagreement
we're having.

48:13.412 --> 48:14.848
- Angie here...
-  Of course.

48:14.979 --> 48:17.111
...um, doesn't think
she looks good tonight.

48:17.198 --> 48:18.896
Don't you think
she looks beautiful?

48:20.158 --> 48:21.159
Well.

48:25.815 --> 48:28.035
- No more so than yourself.

48:28.166 --> 48:32.170
And, uh, incredibly sexy
if I'm not being too forward.

48:32.257 --> 48:33.954
- Oh, thank you.

48:34.041 --> 48:35.347
You should have seen me earlier.

48:35.477 --> 48:38.002
- I was a hot mess.
- She was a mess.

48:38.176 --> 48:40.700
But Francesca here
helped me get ready.

48:40.787 --> 48:41.788
That's right.

48:41.919 --> 48:43.659
I would say
she's quite the artist.

48:43.790 --> 48:44.965
- Don't you think?
-  Artist?

48:45.052 --> 48:46.358
-  Mm-hmm.
- Ah.

48:46.445 --> 48:48.621
Was she your, uh, your canvas?

48:48.969 --> 48:50.753
Maybe.

48:50.884 --> 48:53.495
Are you a--
Are you a connoisseur?

48:54.583 --> 48:56.934
I know what I like
when I see it.

48:57.021 --> 48:58.109
Hmm.

48:58.370 --> 49:00.328
- Do you like what you see now?

49:00.763 --> 49:03.941
I have seen
the most beautiful art

49:04.115 --> 49:05.594
the world has ever known.

49:06.856 --> 49:10.599
And you both come in
a very close... second.

49:10.773 --> 49:12.993
- Oh. Second?
- Oh, come on.

49:13.124 --> 49:15.735
Where have you seen art
more beautiful than us?

49:15.822 --> 49:17.780
- I own it.
-  Oh.

49:17.955 --> 49:20.914
Like, you mean,
like, a... a gallery?

49:20.914 --> 49:24.352
More of a <i>privat</i> collection
here in Los Angeles.

49:24.439 --> 49:27.703
- Oh. Can we, um, can we see it?
- Can we see it?

49:28.530 --> 49:32.404
Like I said,
it's a... private collection.

49:33.231 --> 49:36.234
One only fit
for an Aryan people

49:36.886 --> 49:39.802
of which you... are not.

49:42.370 --> 49:43.676
Good night, ladies.

49:54.948 --> 49:56.994
He's such a pig.

49:58.169 --> 50:00.127
Oh, he's got 'em
here in L.A., all right.

50:00.301 --> 50:01.999
- What else did he say?
- He wouldn't stop bragging

50:02.086 --> 50:03.783
about his private
downtown collection.

50:03.913 --> 50:05.219
He wouldn't
let us see it, though.

50:05.306 --> 50:07.613
He said...
He said we weren't worthy.

50:08.266 --> 50:10.007
Yeah. That sounds like him.

50:10.442 --> 50:12.270
- You did good, Luce.

50:12.444 --> 50:15.186
- You did good.
-  Yeah. Thanks.

50:16.100 --> 50:17.579
- You okay?
- Yeah.

50:18.276 --> 50:19.364
You look good.

50:20.147 --> 50:21.279
Hey, guys.

50:22.193 --> 50:23.150
Focus.

50:24.064 --> 50:25.805
All right, Nadia, Bruno.
You guys are up.

50:25.979 --> 50:27.415
Let's do it.

50:28.286 --> 50:29.591
Come on, come on.

50:29.678 --> 50:31.028
- We'll work on that.
-  Let's go.

50:31.115 --> 50:32.333
Ah, shit.

50:37.208 --> 50:38.339
Nathan!

50:43.910 --> 50:46.913
-  It's Victoria.
- I'm sorry?

50:47.305 --> 50:49.220
We met at my architecture firm

50:49.307 --> 50:51.048
where you lied your way
in to steal some blueprints?

50:51.570 --> 50:54.573
Um, not quite sure I know
what you're talking about.

50:54.921 --> 50:56.270
You think you're pretty slick?

50:56.618 --> 50:59.012
We have security cameras.
I saw you go into the file room.

50:59.360 --> 51:01.971
Well, that's...
that's quite a story.

51:02.972 --> 51:05.018
Don't worry.
I didn't tell anyone.

51:05.149 --> 51:09.588
- I deleted the security footage.
- Really? Why?

51:10.371 --> 51:12.895
Architecture isn't
too terribly exciting.

51:13.287 --> 51:16.290
Plus, I might have
a weakness for Latin men.

51:18.727 --> 51:20.816
- Is that so?

51:20.947 --> 51:22.644
So, what else are you into?

51:29.129 --> 51:30.826
This thing's not gonna
zap me, is it?

51:32.176 --> 51:33.829
It's not broadcasting
any signals,

51:33.960 --> 51:36.223
- it's listening for one.
- You know what?

51:37.311 --> 51:40.097
I bet he's got more than
just paintings in there.

51:40.749 --> 51:43.230
Yeah, I bet he's got,
like, gold or some shit.

51:43.709 --> 51:45.232
- Gold?
-  Mm-hmm.

51:45.363 --> 51:46.755
No one deals with gold anymore.

51:47.278 --> 51:50.019
No, you bet your ass
a guy like Huizen?

51:50.281 --> 51:51.934
- He's got gold.
- Well, you know what?

51:52.021 --> 51:53.197
Then you can come back
and rob him.

51:53.284 --> 51:54.720
Right now,
we're not checking for no gold.

51:56.243 --> 51:59.507
Shit. If I find gold,
I'm taking it.

52:01.379 --> 52:05.644
Do you know how heavy
gold worth stealing is?

52:06.297 --> 52:08.734
- You won't get too far.
- Oh. Hey, hey, hey, wait.

52:08.995 --> 52:10.083
It's opening.

52:10.823 --> 52:12.520
Oh, yeah,
I'm picking up the frequency.

52:12.651 --> 52:13.826
- You getting it?

52:13.956 --> 52:14.914
Hang on.

52:15.088 --> 52:16.220
Oh, you're gonna miss it.

52:16.307 --> 52:17.569
I'm getting it.

52:17.656 --> 52:19.005
It's getting close,
you're gonna miss it!

52:19.092 --> 52:19.962
- I got it.

52:20.093 --> 52:21.486
Yeah?

52:22.965 --> 52:24.532
- Let's go.
- Easy.

52:26.621 --> 52:29.450
All right, done.
That'll open the garage door.

52:29.624 --> 52:31.235
Okay, I'll override the cameras

52:31.322 --> 52:33.150
looping in the street
while you guys get in.

52:33.889 --> 52:35.630
What if there's guards
waiting in the garage?

52:36.457 --> 52:38.764
Ah, you should
leave that to me, yeah?

52:40.026 --> 52:41.723
Ah, yeah. Uh, no.

52:43.682 --> 52:44.683
No guns.

52:45.292 --> 52:46.685
-  What?
- Yeah, no guns.

52:47.076 --> 52:48.513
- Wait, wait. Are you for real?
- Yeah.

52:49.731 --> 52:51.777
You... you heard what she said
about those guys, right?

52:51.951 --> 52:53.082
They're not messing around,

52:53.213 --> 52:54.127
so...

52:54.780 --> 52:58.566
I said no guns. You got that?

52:58.871 --> 53:01.874
My man,
we're thieves, not killers.

53:02.004 --> 53:03.180
Exactly.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.442
This motherfucker
gonna get us killed.

53:11.840 --> 53:13.929
- Thank you.

53:14.234 --> 53:17.890
The Syndicate
does not condone guns or murder,

53:17.977 --> 53:19.413
and neither do I.

53:20.675 --> 53:23.461
That's just fine.

53:23.635 --> 53:27.769
But any friction,
I'm gonna handle things my way.

53:28.161 --> 53:29.031
Yeah?

53:49.530 --> 53:51.053
All right.
Everyone ready to go?

53:52.098 --> 53:53.186
Let's do a comms check.

53:59.932 --> 54:01.238
<i>Annabel, you read me?</i>

54:03.631 --> 54:05.546
Okay. I'm starting recording.

54:19.734 --> 54:22.737
Okay. Cameras are looping.
You're invisible.

54:39.058 --> 54:40.625
All right, here we go.

54:40.712 --> 54:41.800
Fingers crossed.

54:43.454 --> 54:44.803
Jefe, why is it not working?

54:46.195 --> 54:47.153
Motherfucker.

54:47.284 --> 54:48.415
This is gonna be
a short trip, huh?

54:48.546 --> 54:50.199
- Awesome.
-  No, no, no, no, no.

55:00.384 --> 55:02.516
-  There we go!
-  Hell yeah, girl!

55:02.734 --> 55:03.909
We're in.

56:19.114 --> 56:20.202
Okay, we split up.

56:20.681 --> 56:22.509
Radio silence
'til you find the safe.

56:22.988 --> 56:25.469
Stay out of sight.
You two go. Now.

57:13.865 --> 57:15.867
Holy shit. This is it.

57:16.476 --> 57:19.174
-  Yeah? How do you know?
- It has a biometric lock.

57:20.567 --> 57:22.134
What the hell does that mean?

57:22.221 --> 57:23.614
It means it needs a fingerprint.

57:24.266 --> 57:26.573
- Okay, well, can you open it?

57:28.183 --> 57:29.228
Hold up.

57:29.794 --> 57:33.188
- Keep going.

58:05.830 --> 58:07.179
What the hell
did you do that for?

58:07.309 --> 58:08.485
You were taking too long.

58:08.659 --> 58:10.574
I had him
right where I wanted him!

58:11.400 --> 58:13.359
- Let me get that gun.

58:13.751 --> 58:15.056
No guns, remember?

58:17.319 --> 58:18.669
I kicked his ass, though.

58:33.597 --> 58:36.295
- Oh, my goodness. I am so sorry.

58:36.469 --> 58:37.949
It's been so long
since I've worn heels

58:38.123 --> 58:39.733
and just had
a little too much tonight.

58:39.907 --> 58:40.865
I really am sorry.

58:41.039 --> 58:42.170
I'm fine.

58:44.303 --> 58:45.870
Clean that. Dry it.

59:26.650 --> 59:27.781
Do you copy?

59:29.000 --> 59:30.697
Lucille, do you copy?

59:33.831 --> 59:35.484
Hey, two guards are approaching.

1:00:25.143 --> 1:00:27.145
Holy shit.

1:00:28.842 --> 1:00:31.715
- That's not a safe.
- Nope.

1:00:32.846 --> 1:00:36.241
-  That's a fucking vault.
-  Yeah.

1:00:37.111 --> 1:00:39.113
I knew he had more
than just paintings in there.

1:00:39.723 --> 1:00:41.115
Can you open it?

1:00:43.640 --> 1:00:45.511
I guess,
we'll have to find out, right?

1:00:49.907 --> 1:00:52.300
-  Hey. Where do we go?
- Hey, you good?

1:00:52.300 --> 1:00:54.215
<i>Eddie,
head up to the eighth floor.</i>

1:00:54.302 --> 1:00:55.260
Come on, come on.

1:01:16.455 --> 1:01:20.198
- Woah. That's not a safe.

1:01:21.112 --> 1:01:24.681
- Really? I hadn't noticed.
-  Can you open it?

1:01:26.247 --> 1:01:27.727
Huh, I've always
wanted to use this.

1:01:27.814 --> 1:01:29.250
Okay, well, Nadia,
whatever you're gonna do,

1:01:29.337 --> 1:01:30.338
you gotta do it fast.

1:01:30.556 --> 1:01:33.385
Oh, hold up, hold up.
Is that nuclear?

1:01:33.559 --> 1:01:35.430
No, no, no, no,
this is a rare earth magnet,

1:01:35.561 --> 1:01:36.780
it's made out of neodymium.

1:01:36.954 --> 1:01:39.608
Once turned into an alloy
with iron and boron,

1:01:39.696 --> 1:01:41.828
- it becomes magnetized.
- Science lesson later,

1:01:41.959 --> 1:01:43.438
we gotta get this
open right now.

1:01:43.612 --> 1:01:45.266
Okay. Just give me one second. This...

1:01:45.876 --> 1:01:47.791
- Okay.
-  Yeah.

1:01:49.967 --> 1:01:51.925
S... speed it up, Nadia,
come on.

1:01:57.539 --> 1:01:58.758
I'm trying to find this.

1:01:58.845 --> 1:02:00.107
- What? What? What? What?

1:02:00.281 --> 1:02:01.239
Give me more time.

1:02:02.022 --> 1:02:03.328
Uh, we gotta
keep the guards away.

1:02:03.458 --> 1:02:04.633
What do you got for a diversion?

1:02:04.721 --> 1:02:05.983
Hmm, I'll improvise.

1:02:07.854 --> 1:02:09.203
- I'll go with him.
-  No, Luce, no.

1:02:09.290 --> 1:02:10.944
- No, no, I need to help him.
-  No.

1:02:11.466 --> 1:02:12.424
I'll be fine.

1:02:45.196 --> 1:02:46.763
You're just full of surprises,
aren't you?

1:02:46.850 --> 1:02:47.981
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1:02:50.897 --> 1:02:52.638
Shit,
I forgot my stuff at school.

1:02:53.987 --> 1:02:56.163
All right. Yeah. Okay.

1:02:57.208 --> 1:03:01.473
All right. Here we come.
Let's get this bad boy.

1:03:07.784 --> 1:03:10.438
- Now what?
- I'm looking for the solenoid.

1:03:10.612 --> 1:03:11.483
The what?

1:03:12.136 --> 1:03:13.311
When you enter a passcode,

1:03:13.485 --> 1:03:15.617
the keypad sends a signal
to the solenoid.

1:03:15.617 --> 1:03:17.968
<i>The signal then passes
through a magnetic field,</i>

1:03:17.968 --> 1:03:19.839
<i>converting it
to a mechanical movement.</i>

1:03:19.839 --> 1:03:22.059
<i>If the magnets hit the field,</i>

1:03:23.016 --> 1:03:25.802
- it causes the locks to unlock.
- Cool.

1:03:28.152 --> 1:03:29.762
But it'll go faster
if you help me move it, okay?

1:03:29.849 --> 1:03:30.894
- Just...
- Yeah, no, no, yeah,

1:03:31.068 --> 1:03:32.156
- of course. My bad.
- Give me a second.

1:03:36.290 --> 1:03:37.422
What's the word?

1:03:37.639 --> 1:03:39.598
Just... just give me one second.

1:03:40.555 --> 1:03:41.774
Guys, we don't have
enough time.

1:03:41.992 --> 1:03:43.645
Yeah, just give me
one second, please.

1:03:47.040 --> 1:03:48.607
- Come on, come on, come on.

1:03:49.042 --> 1:03:52.002
- Whoo!

1:03:53.220 --> 1:03:56.136

1:05:47.900 --> 1:05:49.119
Look at this motherfucker.

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:51.512
Just the paintings.

1:06:23.240 --> 1:06:24.806
Dry it, give it back to me.

1:06:27.026 --> 1:06:29.420
Oh! Give me that.

1:06:38.864 --> 1:06:40.126
Where are the guards?

1:06:43.651 --> 1:06:46.002
-  <i>Annabel.</i>

1:06:46.002 --> 1:06:48.352
<i>You have foolishly
put your people in danger.</i>

1:06:49.092 --> 1:06:51.050
<i>And for what?</i>

1:06:51.050 --> 1:06:53.879
<i>Now, you will suffer
for your insolence.</i>

1:06:54.445 --> 1:06:56.055
<i>Go! Go!</i>

1:06:56.055 --> 1:06:57.622
<i>Get the hell
out of there right now.</i>

1:06:57.622 --> 1:07:00.233
<i>- Huizen's on his way, hurry up.</i>
-  We gotta go.

1:07:01.713 --> 1:07:03.976
No, no, no,
I don't think so, I... I...

1:07:04.368 --> 1:07:06.457
I'm gonna be the one walking out
with those paintings.

1:07:07.110 --> 1:07:09.895
- What's the matter?
- Call it an insurance policy.

1:07:10.200 --> 1:07:12.028
I carry 'em,
I either get away or I don't.

1:07:12.115 --> 1:07:13.899
You carry 'em,
get nabbed or dropped,

1:07:13.986 --> 1:07:15.683
-  I get nothing.
- No, we stick to the plan.

1:07:15.770 --> 1:07:17.294
We don't have time
for this shit.

1:07:17.381 --> 1:07:19.209
No, no, no, I'm not leaving
without those paintings.

1:07:21.646 --> 1:07:23.343
- Just give it to him, it's fine.

1:07:23.474 --> 1:07:25.824
Yeah. Not so hard.

1:07:26.390 --> 1:07:27.956
- Happy?
- Yeah. I'm happy.

1:07:46.627 --> 1:07:47.672
Oh, split up! Move!

1:07:48.847 --> 1:07:49.978
<i>Shit.</i>

1:09:37.390 --> 1:09:40.219
- Go. Go.
-  Go, go. Go. Okay.

1:10:08.465 --> 1:10:15.211
Shit.
Oh! Oh! Fuck! Fuck!

1:10:16.081 --> 1:10:17.213
I've just been shot.

1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:00.430
Nadia! Nadia, Nadia!

1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:01.561
- What happened?
- Come on.

1:11:01.692 --> 1:11:02.649
They shot me!

1:11:03.215 --> 1:11:04.564
- They fucking shot me!
- Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on.

1:11:04.695 --> 1:11:06.523
-  Let's go, let's go!
-  Fuck!

1:11:06.610 --> 1:11:09.308
Let's go! Go, go, go, go!

1:11:14.618 --> 1:11:15.793
- Hurry, hurry.
- Shit.

1:11:15.967 --> 1:11:17.185
We gotta go. Go, go, go, go, go.

1:11:21.015 --> 1:11:24.236
Freeze! Fucking hold it!
Don't move!

1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:27.674
Drop it.

1:11:28.588 --> 1:11:30.024
- Okay. Okay!
-  Drop it now.

1:11:30.329 --> 1:11:31.809
- Back the fuck up!
-  Okay.

1:11:32.462 --> 1:11:33.724
Eddie, get in the car.

1:11:36.944 --> 1:11:38.032
Hurry up.

1:11:42.036 --> 1:11:43.647
- Hey!

1:11:43.734 --> 1:11:44.865
- Jesus!

1:11:46.040 --> 1:11:48.086
Let's go! Eddie. Let's go! Go!

1:11:48.347 --> 1:11:50.480
- What the fuck?
- Oh, what the fuck?

1:12:05.408 --> 1:12:07.540
- Just hold on.

1:12:39.398 --> 1:12:41.182
Okay, I got it,
I got it, I got it.

1:12:41.269 --> 1:12:42.314
I got it. I got it.

1:12:42.749 --> 1:12:44.011
Gotta just hold on.

1:12:45.491 --> 1:12:46.449
It's okay.

1:12:50.888 --> 1:12:52.672
Okay, Nadia,
you're all right, you're okay.

1:12:53.978 --> 1:12:55.022
Come on, up in this chair.

1:12:55.196 --> 1:12:56.241
Get me the first aid kit.

1:12:56.328 --> 1:12:57.329
The first aid kit
is right there.

1:12:57.416 --> 1:12:58.461
- Where?
-  Right there.

1:12:58.591 --> 1:12:59.679
Right there. Let me see, mama.

1:12:59.766 --> 1:13:00.854
That's right. You're okay.

1:13:00.941 --> 1:13:02.421
Let me look at it.
Let me look at it.

1:13:04.118 --> 1:13:05.772
-  Press it.
-  I think it's okay.

1:13:05.859 --> 1:13:08.122
- What the hell was that?
-  Oh, my god! Fuck.

1:13:08.253 --> 1:13:10.386
What about your little
no gun rule, huh?

1:13:10.473 --> 1:13:11.735
Why did you kill that guard?

1:13:11.822 --> 1:13:12.953
Hey. What were you doing?

1:13:13.040 --> 1:13:14.477
Why did you kill that guard?

1:13:14.651 --> 1:13:16.348
Everybody just shut the fuck up!

1:13:16.435 --> 1:13:17.654
- Annie, what the hell...
- Quiet!

1:13:17.784 --> 1:13:18.785
- Quiet!
- ...were you thinking?

1:13:18.872 --> 1:13:20.396
We don't do that! That's not us!

1:13:21.179 --> 1:13:22.963
Okay. You're all right,
you're okay.

1:13:23.486 --> 1:13:25.879
We go to the Syndicate
and tell them what happened.

1:13:25.966 --> 1:13:28.186
No! You know they'll have
nothing to do with this.

1:13:28.491 --> 1:13:30.710
Annabel,
you said they were priceless.

1:13:30.797 --> 1:13:32.016
Sell them to the highest bidder.

1:13:32.103 --> 1:13:33.844
No, selling stolen art
is the quickest way

1:13:33.931 --> 1:13:35.367
to get busted,
even on the dark web.

1:13:35.454 --> 1:13:36.890
- We can't do that.
-  Then what?

1:13:38.675 --> 1:13:42.200
-  Then what?
- Fuck.

1:13:43.157 --> 1:13:44.376
- We destroy them.
-  No.

1:13:44.507 --> 1:13:45.899
- Yes!
- No way. Not again.

1:13:45.986 --> 1:13:47.640
-  Yes!
- No. Ransom.

1:13:47.858 --> 1:13:49.729
We demand
a ransom from the Nazi.

1:13:49.816 --> 1:13:50.861
No. No.

1:13:51.078 --> 1:13:52.558
Josef would have
never wanted that.

1:13:52.776 --> 1:13:55.996
Josef? I'm so done
giving a shit about Josef

1:13:56.083 --> 1:13:57.998
and your little cause.
All right?

1:13:58.085 --> 1:13:59.478
You just shot
a guard in cold blood.

1:13:59.913 --> 1:14:00.958
You did that.

1:14:01.611 --> 1:14:06.093
Now, me, I'm gonna get paid
one way or another. All right?

1:14:54.881 --> 1:14:56.187
<i>Hey, Annabel.</i>

1:15:06.066 --> 1:15:10.070
Hey, guys.
He said he'd meet later today.

1:15:16.337 --> 1:15:17.295
Where are you going?

1:15:19.558 --> 1:15:20.951
So close.

1:15:21.212 --> 1:15:23.954
Uh. I got some errands to run.
Is that okay with you guys?

1:15:24.911 --> 1:15:26.130
The paintings?

1:15:26.260 --> 1:15:30.308
Yeah, like, I trust any of you,
especially you.

1:15:30.700 --> 1:15:31.962
Whoa, whoa.

1:15:32.179 --> 1:15:33.790
We can't just let you
walk out of here with them.

1:15:34.486 --> 1:15:36.793
- I'm coming.
- Yeah, I don't... I don't care.

1:15:37.228 --> 1:15:38.098
See you later.

1:15:49.414 --> 1:15:50.589
What the hell are we doing here?

1:15:50.981 --> 1:15:52.069
Gotta unload something
real quick.

1:15:52.156 --> 1:15:53.418
I thought you quit.

1:15:54.158 --> 1:15:56.769
Uh. No, I'm just out collecting.

1:15:57.378 --> 1:15:59.598
I got something you want.

1:16:03.297 --> 1:16:05.735
Boom. What do you think?

1:16:09.434 --> 1:16:10.609
Where'd you get this?

1:16:11.479 --> 1:16:12.568
It's pretty nice, huh?

1:16:12.655 --> 1:16:14.004
I'm gonna ask you again.

1:16:14.091 --> 1:16:15.005
Where'd you get it?

1:16:15.266 --> 1:16:17.398
- Does it matter?
- Hell, yes, it matters.

1:16:17.485 --> 1:16:19.183
It's my ass that's on the line.

1:16:19.487 --> 1:16:20.445
Okay. Look, old man,

1:16:20.576 --> 1:16:22.360
I know you know people,
all right?

1:16:22.490 --> 1:16:24.318
I know you got
buyers for shit like this.

1:16:27.147 --> 1:16:28.192
I do.

1:16:31.456 --> 1:16:33.153
- What the hell?
- Calm down.

1:16:36.940 --> 1:16:38.637
That's what I'm talking about!

1:16:39.072 --> 1:16:42.380
Hmm! [sniffs] Smells so good.

1:16:43.163 --> 1:16:45.862
One ain't enough.
They gonna want more.

1:16:47.037 --> 1:16:50.257
No worries, Gramps. Plenty more
where that came from.

1:16:51.519 --> 1:16:52.608
Let's roll.

1:17:05.098 --> 1:17:08.798
Something's not right.
He should be here by now.

1:17:11.583 --> 1:17:12.932
I'm gonna go find the others.

1:17:16.762 --> 1:17:17.676
Listen.

1:17:18.155 --> 1:17:19.373
Try and stay
out of trouble, huh?

1:17:52.798 --> 1:17:53.756
Where is she?

1:17:55.583 --> 1:17:56.802
I'm sure she's around.

1:17:58.021 --> 1:18:00.937
You are either
incredibly brave

1:18:01.677 --> 1:18:02.982
or incredibly stupid.

1:18:04.114 --> 1:18:05.637
I'm the one who's here, ain't I?

1:18:05.724 --> 1:18:08.988
Ah. Tell me why I don't just

1:18:09.336 --> 1:18:11.643
shoot you where you stand
and take what is mine?

1:18:12.862 --> 1:18:15.734
Um. Maybe
there's a gun on you right now.

1:18:16.648 --> 1:18:19.912
And, maybe if you kill me,
the cops will be here

1:18:19.999 --> 1:18:21.740
before you make it out
with your car.

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:27.703
You have no idea how much
those are worth, do you?

1:18:27.877 --> 1:18:30.880
I figure...
...a million?

1:18:31.663 --> 1:18:34.318
More than enough
to live a pretty damn good life.

1:18:35.275 --> 1:18:38.583
A million? Yeah.
Is that all?

1:18:43.631 --> 1:18:44.720
What is this?

1:18:45.111 --> 1:18:46.765
That's an account number, chief.

1:18:48.071 --> 1:18:50.856
Sure you got a team of bankers
on speed dial.

1:18:52.858 --> 1:18:55.469
Fine.
Now, I take my paintings.

1:19:10.746 --> 1:19:12.530
Sorry about your guy.

1:19:13.618 --> 1:19:14.662
My guy?

1:19:15.228 --> 1:19:16.577
Yeah. I mean, you know

1:19:16.664 --> 1:19:18.449
how these things
go sometimes, right?

1:19:18.841 --> 1:19:19.972
Shoot or get shot.

1:19:23.454 --> 1:19:25.456
I think we have a problem here.

1:19:26.413 --> 1:19:27.414
Yeah, and what's that?

1:19:29.634 --> 1:19:31.331
None of my guards were shot.

1:19:31.592 --> 1:19:34.508
Bullshit. I saw him go down.

1:19:35.683 --> 1:19:37.642
And these are not my paintings.

1:19:38.904 --> 1:19:41.733
What are you talking about?
They... they are.

1:19:41.951 --> 1:19:44.127
I don't believe
that Monet or Van Gogh

1:19:44.605 --> 1:19:46.651
bought their canvases
from a hobby store.

1:19:51.743 --> 1:19:54.528
- Son of a bitch.

1:19:56.617 --> 1:19:59.664
They switched bags on me.
All right, uh...

1:19:59.925 --> 1:20:02.754
To steal my paintings
is one thing.

1:20:03.537 --> 1:20:07.454
But to steal my gold,
that's a grave mistake.

1:20:07.977 --> 1:20:10.153
What are you...
what are you talking about?

1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:12.416
I'm trying to bring your shit
back to you.

1:20:12.590 --> 1:20:15.245
You know what they used to do
to thieves in Nazi Germany?

1:20:32.436 --> 1:20:33.567
- Miss Gomez?
- Yes?

1:20:34.264 --> 1:20:38.181
The museum is immensely grateful
for your donation.

1:20:38.355 --> 1:20:39.530
It has always been believed

1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:41.488
that these works
were lost forever.

1:20:42.925 --> 1:20:43.882
May I ask,

1:20:44.361 --> 1:20:46.319
how did they come
to be in your possession?

1:20:46.537 --> 1:20:48.365
I own them.
They were given to me

1:20:48.452 --> 1:20:50.454
by the original owner,
Josef Goodman.

1:20:51.237 --> 1:20:52.848
He was a Holocaust survivor.

1:20:55.807 --> 1:20:58.331
These are the original
ownership papers and letters

1:20:58.418 --> 1:21:01.073
of authorship
from the artists themselves.

1:21:03.902 --> 1:21:05.295
- May I?
-  Yes.

1:21:09.865 --> 1:21:11.040
My goodness.

1:21:14.043 --> 1:21:16.915
We will, uh, of course,
have to, uh,

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:20.571
- examine these for authenticity.
- Of course, of course.

1:21:20.963 --> 1:21:22.181
I know they're real and I'm sure

1:21:22.268 --> 1:21:23.748
you'll find that
to be true as well.

1:21:26.620 --> 1:21:27.795
Thank you.

1:21:38.632 --> 1:21:41.200
Those are my paintings.

1:21:46.205 --> 1:21:48.904
I would love to see you
tell that to the authorities.

1:21:51.384 --> 1:21:52.429
Keep them.

1:21:53.082 --> 1:21:56.346
- I was tired of them anyway.
- Is that so?

1:21:57.825 --> 1:22:00.698
How did you do it?

1:22:01.742 --> 1:22:05.094
How did you allow that fool
to bring me those fakes?

1:22:14.407 --> 1:22:16.105
I'm not leaving
without those paintings.

1:22:16.192 --> 1:22:17.758
- Just give it to him, it's fine.

1:22:18.194 --> 1:22:19.195
Not so hard.

1:22:19.499 --> 1:22:20.457
Drop it!

1:22:21.110 --> 1:22:22.415
- Drop it now.
- Okay, okay.

1:22:22.502 --> 1:22:23.460
Hurry up.

1:22:25.984 --> 1:22:27.116
Hey!

1:22:29.683 --> 1:22:30.771
We're good, right?

1:22:35.080 --> 1:22:36.038
Yeah, we're good.

1:22:38.040 --> 1:22:40.085
Every time
you walk into that vault

1:22:41.043 --> 1:22:43.349
and see four empty spaces
on the wall,

1:22:44.263 --> 1:22:47.136
I want you to wonder,
"How did she do it?"

1:22:48.441 --> 1:22:50.966
How did my team
walk out of your vault

1:22:51.749 --> 1:22:53.142
with these four paintings?

1:22:53.925 --> 1:22:55.187
You think you've gotten away

1:22:55.274 --> 1:22:57.059
with something so grand here.

1:22:58.277 --> 1:23:00.627
These paintings are nothing
compared to my other treasures,

1:23:00.758 --> 1:23:03.021
pieces far greater in value

1:23:03.108 --> 1:23:05.893
and significance than...
than some old canvases.

1:23:07.373 --> 1:23:08.418
I'm sure.

1:23:08.940 --> 1:23:10.811
- And we're coming for all of it.
-  Oh?

1:23:10.986 --> 1:23:13.075
Yeah. And we won't stop
until we get

1:23:13.205 --> 1:23:16.165
every last piece
and give it back to the world.

1:23:17.862 --> 1:23:20.778
I'm not so sure
you'll get a chance.

1:23:21.997 --> 1:23:23.085
It's time now for me

1:23:23.172 --> 1:23:26.001
to collect the bounty
from the Kerrs.

1:23:27.219 --> 1:23:29.047
Well, like I said,

1:23:29.395 --> 1:23:30.744
you know where to find me.

1:23:32.181 --> 1:23:33.834
But until you do,
I have some friends

1:23:33.965 --> 1:23:35.227
who would love to speak to you.

1:23:42.060 --> 1:23:43.192
Oh, look at this.

1:23:46.847 --> 1:23:49.067
You can't hide her forever.

1:23:50.982 --> 1:23:53.289
I've seen
what you're willing to risk

1:23:53.419 --> 1:23:54.768
for some old paintings.

1:23:55.552 --> 1:23:57.771
But what is a mother
willing to risk

1:23:58.424 --> 1:24:00.209
for the safety of her own child?

1:24:02.167 --> 1:24:03.212
Trust me.

1:24:04.996 --> 1:24:06.693
You don't wanna fucking know.

1:24:09.783 --> 1:24:11.829
Mr. Huizen,
would you come with us, please?

1:24:12.003 --> 1:24:13.831
What is this about?

1:24:14.005 --> 1:24:15.398
These treasures of yours.

1:24:15.528 --> 1:24:17.052
We have some questions for you

1:24:17.139 --> 1:24:18.879
regarding
documentation of ownership,

1:24:19.097 --> 1:24:20.620
and whether or not
you've paid taxes.

1:24:21.230 --> 1:24:22.231
Right this way.

1:24:25.103 --> 1:24:26.452
Hey, Annabel?

1:24:26.539 --> 1:24:27.801
- Yeah?
- Can I ask you something?

1:24:28.585 --> 1:24:29.847
Where'd you get
the fingerprints?

1:24:29.977 --> 1:24:31.414
And how'd you know
we were gonna need them?

1:24:31.544 --> 1:24:33.677
Sorry, that was... that was me.

1:24:33.677 --> 1:24:36.201
<i>Yeah, I, uh...
I overheard him bragging about</i>

1:24:36.201 --> 1:24:37.724
<i>all his treasures,</i>

1:24:37.724 --> 1:24:40.205
<i>and how he keeps them
well-protected with guards</i>

1:24:40.205 --> 1:24:43.252
and biometrics
and a state-of-the-art safe.

1:24:43.556 --> 1:24:45.602
Which turned out to be a vault.

1:24:45.776 --> 1:24:47.691
-  Right.
- Hmm.

1:24:47.821 --> 1:24:49.867
Son of a bitch
was so arrogant

1:24:49.954 --> 1:24:52.304
he didn't know the difference
between a vault and a safe.

1:24:58.049 --> 1:25:01.052
Wait a second, how did you know
Bruno was gonna double cross us?

1:25:01.661 --> 1:25:03.010
We needed a wildcard.

1:25:03.272 --> 1:25:05.274
Someone to take the fall
if things went bad.

1:25:05.361 --> 1:25:07.493
Yeah, and he played
the role perfectly.

1:25:07.972 --> 1:25:11.584
I mean, him going there alone
was the best smoke and mirrors

1:25:11.671 --> 1:25:12.672
we could have hoped for

1:25:12.803 --> 1:25:14.021
to get these
paintings here safely.

1:25:14.370 --> 1:25:17.329
- Yeah.
-  Yep. Yep, yep, yep.

1:25:33.867 --> 1:25:35.913
Josef, we did it.

1:25:54.714 --> 1:25:56.455
Oh, Annabel, you've done well.

1:25:56.629 --> 1:25:58.065
Josef would be proud.

1:25:59.284 --> 1:26:02.331
The paintings you recovered
are... are priceless.

1:26:02.766 --> 1:26:04.942
Our appraisers
have valued them beyond

1:26:05.029 --> 1:26:07.118
the levels
of our... our current assets.

1:26:07.292 --> 1:26:09.381
And with their donation
to the museum,

1:26:09.468 --> 1:26:12.819
we're able to shelter
our other taxable resources.

1:26:13.124 --> 1:26:15.866
Our budget
for future operations

1:26:15.953 --> 1:26:17.302
is tripled.

1:26:17.520 --> 1:26:22.177
But Josef was not the only one
the Nazis stole from.

1:26:23.308 --> 1:26:24.657
There are others.

1:26:25.310 --> 1:26:28.400
And like yourself,
they have done everything

1:26:28.487 --> 1:26:32.535
in their power to preserve
their ownership and right.

1:26:33.188 --> 1:26:39.106
So, we hope you are not
considering retirement just yet.

1:26:39.324 --> 1:26:41.805
- I wouldn't think of it.

1:26:42.066 --> 1:26:44.242
- Lehayim.
-  Lehayim.

1:26:46.810 --> 1:26:48.551
All right, ladies, round two...

1:26:48.681 --> 1:26:49.813
-  Yes!
-  ...has arrived.

1:26:50.205 --> 1:26:51.728
Whoo-hoo!

1:26:52.381 --> 1:26:55.297
- Oh, she ready. What?
- What?

1:26:55.384 --> 1:26:57.908
I just, uh...
I've been thinking, right?

1:26:58.038 --> 1:26:59.779
- I don't... I don't know.

1:27:00.127 --> 1:27:02.826
Like, I get
that we did a good thing, right?

1:27:02.913 --> 1:27:05.742
You know, that everybody
gets to see the paintings,

1:27:05.916 --> 1:27:07.570
the Nazis don't have 'em.

1:27:09.354 --> 1:27:10.573
But why did we have
to donate them?

1:27:10.660 --> 1:27:11.922
Oh, come on.

1:27:12.052 --> 1:27:13.750
- We did a good deed.
-  Eddie...

1:27:13.924 --> 1:27:15.665
- That should be reward enough.
- Yeah.

1:27:16.840 --> 1:27:19.234
Listen, plus it saves
the Syndicate millions in taxes

1:27:19.321 --> 1:27:20.583
when you donate the paintings.

1:27:21.540 --> 1:27:24.630
That means we make more money
to steal more shit.

1:27:24.804 --> 1:27:26.197
- Exactly.

1:27:26.284 --> 1:27:28.373
- Mm-hmm.
- Which, now that you mention it,

1:27:28.460 --> 1:27:30.506
the Syndicate
has another mark for us, so...

1:27:30.680 --> 1:27:33.030
...who's up
for another challenge?

1:27:34.031 --> 1:27:37.252
Huh? Huh?

1:27:37.426 --> 1:27:38.905
You know
you're my ride or die, Annie.

1:27:39.079 --> 1:27:41.168
-  Yes!
- Ooh.

1:27:41.256 --> 1:27:42.474
-  Yes!
- It beats the hell out

1:27:42.561 --> 1:27:44.215
of spending another five to ten
with the feds.

1:27:44.302 --> 1:27:46.565
- So, I'm in.
- Mm-hmm.

1:27:47.914 --> 1:27:49.002
Nadia?

1:27:50.265 --> 1:27:52.267
- Hell, yeah.
- Hell, yeah!

1:27:54.660 --> 1:27:56.880
- Good.
-  Are we good?

1:27:56.967 --> 1:27:58.229
- You know...
- Come on, come on.

1:27:58.447 --> 1:27:59.970
...it still would have been cool
to be millionaires.

1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:01.232
- I'm just...

1:28:01.363 --> 1:28:02.581
...I'm just saying,
you know?

1:28:02.712 --> 1:28:04.017
- Cheers.
- Cheers!

1:28:04.104 --> 1:28:06.150
