You tell him, Bruce Again.

23:12.474 --> 23:13.975
Ma'am, you can't leave here.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.477
You can't keep me here.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.813
-[women clamoring]
-Good for you, sister!

23:17.896 --> 23:22.025
<i>And that's why I'm gonna name my ocelot</i>
<i>after you!</i>

23:23.485 --> 23:25.237
-Come back here!
-Go to hell!

23:26.822 --> 23:29.699
-Tell me about this.
-Ooh, you're strong, I like that.

23:29.783 --> 23:31.701
-I'm Samantha.
-Just tell me, Samantha.

23:31.785 --> 23:35.205
The Lamaze method is a revolutionary,

23:35.288 --> 23:39.835
holistic, and empowering natural option
for childbirth.

23:39.918 --> 23:43.046
-With Lamaze, you take the power back.
-Go on.

23:43.463 --> 23:48.677
No longer will you be rendered unconscious
by a doctor's drugs. Ugh.

23:48.760 --> 23:54.266
You will experience the miracle of birth,
awake and in control.

23:54.349 --> 23:58.061
And no longer will you have to listen
to what others say is best for you.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.188
<i>You know what feels right.</i>

24:00.272 --> 24:02.274
You know that song I said I loved?

24:02.357 --> 24:03.859
It sucks now.

24:03.942 --> 24:05.444
But we can fix it.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.903
The good news is all we have to do

24:06.987 --> 24:09.072
is change the melody, lyrics,
and instruments.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.074
-I'm cool with it.
-Whatever sells.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.285
I don't even know y'all's names.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.454
I... guess so.

24:15.537 --> 24:17.414
That's exactly what
I was hoping you'd say.

24:17.497 --> 24:22.377
[Samantha] <i>Giving birth is about being</i>
<i>surrounded by the ones you love the most.</i>

24:22.461 --> 24:26.047
<i>Embrace their energy and hold them close.</i>

24:26.131 --> 24:28.633
Oh, my sweet Anthony!

24:29.134 --> 24:30.886
I love you so much!

24:30.969 --> 24:32.471
I love you. And you know what?

24:32.554 --> 24:36.016
I love you, and I-- You know what?
I want to eat. I want to eat.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.934
Oh, he's hungry.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.269
What do you want, baby?

24:39.352 --> 24:41.813
I want to eat that nasty pussy!

24:41.897 --> 24:43.023
[both gasp]

24:43.106 --> 24:44.524
[Anthony] Ow, my pussy!

24:44.608 --> 24:48.778
[Samantha] <i>Your husband will be</i>
<i>an active partner in the birthing process.</i>

24:50.447 --> 24:52.365
[all cheering]

24:52.449 --> 24:54.993
[Samantha] <i>No longer will he get drunk</i>
<i>in the waiting room</i>

24:55.076 --> 24:56.578
<i>while you do all the work.</i>

24:56.661 --> 24:58.622
-[laughs]
-Yeah. [chuckles]

24:59.247 --> 25:02.250
And you will be able
to emotionally connect

25:02.334 --> 25:06.254
with your baby
in its first moments of life.

25:06.338 --> 25:10.509
This is what I've been searching for.
I can't wait to learn from you.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.802
Give me a call when you get out of here.

25:12.886 --> 25:13.720
I will.

25:14.804 --> 25:18.141
Catamarans?
What the fuck's an "Escondido"?

25:19.518 --> 25:20.644
Hello?

25:22.354 --> 25:25.106
Do you have any idea
what time it is, young man?

25:25.190 --> 25:27.359
Hey, Mr. Goomer.
Uh... it's quarter to ten.

25:27.442 --> 25:28.568
Oh, thanks!

25:28.652 --> 25:30.195
Oh, yeah, your mom's in the hospital,

25:30.278 --> 25:32.197
and a bear broke in
and clogged your toilet.

25:32.280 --> 25:35.200
[Frank and Big Bill laughing]

25:35.283 --> 25:38.912
Dad, you saved my ass.
And you fixed that fucking machine!

25:38.995 --> 25:41.540
There's no problem on God's green Earth

25:41.623 --> 25:44.209
that can't be solved
by a roll of duct tape.

25:44.292 --> 25:47.837
That's how you set my broken arm
when I fell out of that chestnut tree.

25:47.921 --> 25:49.464
-It still clicks!
-[clicking]

25:49.548 --> 25:50.465
[both laughing]

25:50.549 --> 25:51.967
I love it! Adds character!

25:54.928 --> 25:58.682
Oh! Some poor bastard
doesn't know how to drunk drive.

25:58.765 --> 26:00.684
He's ruining it for the rest of us!

26:00.767 --> 26:03.061
[both laughing]

26:03.144 --> 26:04.437
That looks like Sue's car.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.690
[tires squealing]

26:07.232 --> 26:10.402
Sue, I came here as fast as I could.
Are you okay? Is the baby okay?

26:10.485 --> 26:13.196
We're fine. We're fine.
They wouldn't let me leave without you.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.198
-You again!
-Yes, me!

26:15.282 --> 26:17.492
Just because you live under a bridge
and eat goats

26:17.576 --> 26:20.745
doesn't mean you can lock up my wife,
you skin tag with eyes!

26:20.829 --> 26:23.582
Frank! Frank, it's okay. Really.

26:23.665 --> 26:27.502
This was a crazy day,
but it led me to exactly what I needed.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.964
I want to have the baby
with the Lamaze method.

26:31.047 --> 26:33.675
-Sure, honey. Whatever you want.
-It's this thing where you--

26:33.758 --> 26:36.011
Whatever it is, I love it. And I love you.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.179
Aw, I love you, honey.

26:42.559 --> 26:44.769
[all] Aw!

26:46.354 --> 26:49.065
Mind your own business,
you fucking sick people!

26:49.149 --> 26:51.484
[inspirational music playing]

27:19.179 --> 27:20.096
[whirring]

27:20.180 --> 27:21.640
[gunshot]
