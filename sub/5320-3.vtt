WEBVTT

00:01.022 --> 00:02.323
<i>College football is fine,</i>

00:02.391 --> 00:05.560
but, next week, the NFL
finally begins. Praise Shiva!

00:05.628 --> 00:07.629
And we can be watching
the games right here

00:07.696 --> 00:11.733
in Casa de Ruxin because Baby Geoffrey
and Sofia are in Puerto Rico,

00:11.800 --> 00:13.635
which means I have the illest,

00:13.702 --> 00:17.405
chillest, most maxed-out
to the relaxin' bachelor pad

00:17.473 --> 00:20.074
in the history
of football, bros.

00:20.142 --> 00:22.810
I would like to throw my
oxblood fedora into the ring.

00:22.878 --> 00:24.979
If you guys want
to watch a great game

00:25.047 --> 00:27.448
at a place that is on fleek,

00:27.516 --> 00:28.683
you need to come
to my new condo.

00:28.751 --> 00:30.051
Meegan and I would
love to have you.

00:30.119 --> 00:31.786
Yeah. How do you feel
about that, Pete?

00:31.854 --> 00:33.588
You want to go watch
the games at Andre's?

00:33.656 --> 00:37.025
The NFL season is upon us.
Don't have time to hate.

00:37.092 --> 00:38.159
Andre can't be in
love with Meegan

00:38.227 --> 00:39.827
and Shiva at the same time.

00:39.895 --> 00:41.029
So let bygones be bygones.

00:41.096 --> 00:42.463
Thank you.

00:42.531 --> 00:43.531
That's the chill atmosphere

00:43.599 --> 00:44.999
that we create at Casa de Ruxin.
Ow!

00:45.067 --> 00:46.100
That was my toe!
Ow.

00:46.168 --> 00:47.969
Oh, God. Oh!
Why do you always... Oh!

00:48.037 --> 00:49.103
I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

00:49.171 --> 00:50.071
Good job. Good job.

00:50.139 --> 00:51.940
Hello?

00:52.007 --> 00:55.310
Rodney, we talked about this.
Be respectful of the house.

00:55.377 --> 00:57.545
We're taking great care
of the house, I promise.

00:57.613 --> 00:59.580
And, uh,
we're having a nice time.

00:59.648 --> 01:01.749
A very chill time.

01:01.817 --> 01:04.185
Respect your body, too.
Stay away from the chips.

01:04.253 --> 01:07.288
Eat those carrot sticks I got you.
Oh, um, these <i> are</i> carrots.

01:07.356 --> 01:09.724
It just looks like Doritos
from the angle.

01:09.792 --> 01:11.459
Keep the house clean.

01:11.527 --> 01:12.694
Love you.
Love you.

01:12.761 --> 01:14.162
Bye.
What angle?

01:14.229 --> 01:16.331
It's this, like,
very chill thing that we did.

01:16.398 --> 01:18.199
With Sofia being away,
she wanted to make sure

01:18.200 --> 01:19.367
that all the security

01:19.435 --> 01:21.769
in the house was good,
so she put some cameras up.

01:21.837 --> 01:25.239
Nanny cam kind of things.
- What? You're on, like,

01:25.307 --> 01:28.109
<i>Big Brother</i> without
the sloppy sex and the racism.

01:28.177 --> 01:30.712
Yeah. It's pretty fun.

01:30.779 --> 01:32.613
Oh. Hey, babe.

01:32.681 --> 01:35.683
Rodney, tell your friends to keep
their feet off the coffee table.

01:35.751 --> 01:37.518
Take your feet
off the coffee table.

01:37.586 --> 01:39.320
But, like, in a
chill way, right?

01:39.388 --> 01:42.123
And the coasters are there
for a reason. Use 'em.

01:42.191 --> 01:43.825
Oh, of course we're using
the coasters. Put the coaster...

01:43.892 --> 01:44.959
What?

01:45.027 --> 01:46.461
And I'm seeing
a lot of junk food.

01:46.528 --> 01:47.462
That's a lot of sodium.

01:47.529 --> 01:48.997
We're using
the healthy stuff now.

01:49.064 --> 01:49.998
No, no, getting rid
No, I'm not done.

01:50.065 --> 01:50.999
of the bad snacks.
I'm not done.

01:51.066 --> 01:52.066
Uh-uh. We're all good.

01:52.134 --> 01:53.468
And...
Let me have 'em.

01:53.535 --> 01:55.336
Don't...

01:55.404 --> 01:57.405
What was that?
That was the next door neighbor's dog,

01:57.473 --> 01:59.240
but don't worry.
I just Tasered him. He's dead.

01:59.308 --> 02:01.642
Okay. I love you, babe.
I love you, too.

02:01.710 --> 02:03.878
I'm watching you.
Mwah, mwah. Bye-bye.

02:03.946 --> 02:06.954
Very chill, very relaxed,
bro'd-out vibe.

02:07.074 --> 02:14.712

02:15.224 --> 02:16.991
Hmm!

02:17.059 --> 02:17.959
Babe?
Yeah.

02:18.027 --> 02:20.795
Lookie what I found. Huh?

02:20.863 --> 02:22.997
This is gonna look
really good on you.

02:23.065 --> 02:25.533
I want to see you in this
and nothing else.

02:25.601 --> 02:26.801
Daddy like.

02:26.869 --> 02:28.803
That's great, Daddy.

02:28.871 --> 02:30.471
But that's your daughter's.

02:30.539 --> 02:31.506
What?

02:31.573 --> 02:32.507
That's Ellie's bra.

02:32.574 --> 02:34.776
Oh, my God!

02:34.843 --> 02:37.045
Oh, my God, why didn't you
tell me about bras?

02:37.112 --> 02:38.512
You told me
you didn't want to know.

02:38.514 --> 02:40.248
I want to know
before I imagine taking it off.

02:40.315 --> 02:41.449
Dad?

02:41.517 --> 02:43.351
What are you doing?
Oh...

02:43.419 --> 02:44.619
we were just saying

02:44.686 --> 02:45.953
how pretty this is
gonna look on you.

02:46.021 --> 02:47.755
It's your nice color.
No!

02:47.823 --> 02:49.791
Honey, we're just happy
you're developing.

02:49.858 --> 02:51.659
You're disgusting!
Don't make it weird!

02:51.727 --> 02:53.428
Yeah. She made it weird.

02:53.495 --> 02:56.064
Do you think we'll go to therapy
together or separate sessions?

02:56.131 --> 02:57.098
Probably both.

02:57.166 --> 02:58.699
I got big news, guys.

02:58.767 --> 03:01.369
Follow me.

03:01.437 --> 03:03.304
Introducing EBDB Prime.

03:03.372 --> 03:05.706
I signed you guys all up for it.

03:05.774 --> 03:06.707
Great. What is it?

03:06.775 --> 03:08.109
Well, with EBDB Prime,

03:08.177 --> 03:10.678
you have access
to exclusive content.

03:10.746 --> 03:11.913
Like your sex tapes?

03:11.980 --> 03:13.581
No.
Everyone has access to those.

03:13.649 --> 03:15.516
Now, I know
what you're thinking.

03:15.584 --> 03:17.652
"Oh, this is gonna be
so much dollars."

03:17.719 --> 03:19.587
Not true. It's only

03:19.655 --> 03:21.989
a couple extra bucks that I take
out of your wallet every month

03:22.057 --> 03:23.324
on top of your EBDB membership.

03:23.392 --> 03:27.462
Babe, how can we turn down
this bargain robbery?

03:27.529 --> 03:29.464
And on top of it,
you get shipping benefits.

03:29.531 --> 03:31.866
Ooh.
Mmm. If you order through EBDB Prime,

03:31.934 --> 03:34.535
you can get a bra
or a female condom for Ellie

03:34.603 --> 03:35.970
by tw...
No. Nope.

03:36.038 --> 03:36.971
Stop it. Get out.

03:37.039 --> 03:38.120
Get this thing out of here.

03:38.140 --> 03:39.874
I was leaving anyway.
Where you goin'?

03:39.942 --> 03:41.642
Kitchen.

03:43.011 --> 03:46.481
That is the second hat closet.

03:46.548 --> 03:49.083
And now welcome
to the nature preserve.

03:49.151 --> 03:50.918
Andre, they're all dead.

03:50.986 --> 03:52.186
Well, that's the only way he can
get anything to live with him.

03:52.254 --> 03:53.788
And, guys, I think
you're really gonna like this.

03:53.856 --> 03:55.556
Are you going my way?

03:55.624 --> 03:57.925
What does that thing run on,
Dave Navarro's pubic lice?

03:57.993 --> 04:00.128
No. He's completely shaved.

04:00.195 --> 04:02.563
And now, gentlemen,
I introduce you

04:02.631 --> 04:06.200
to the cathedral, where we'll be
watching football every weekend

04:06.268 --> 04:09.303
of the 2015 season.
Holy shit.

04:09.371 --> 04:11.005
That's a huge
projection screen, Andre.

04:11.073 --> 04:12.940
Oh, no, no... that's
a large white canvas.

04:13.008 --> 04:14.041
It's an art installation.

04:14.109 --> 04:15.343
Oh, shit.
- That stinks!

04:15.410 --> 04:18.012
Well, everybody, let me
give you a good old...

04:18.079 --> 04:21.749
taste of what we have
in store this Sunday.

04:21.817 --> 04:23.417
<i>Football's back</i>
<i>at DraftKings.com...</i>

04:23.485 --> 04:26.087
You guys ever interested in trying out Draft Kings?
No, no, no.

04:26.155 --> 04:28.156
I got to keep all my
focus on one league.

04:28.223 --> 04:29.724
I agree with Kevin.
I mean, there's something

04:29.791 --> 04:31.559
about the loyalty
to one's league.

04:31.627 --> 04:33.227
<i>It's the simplest way of winning</i>

04:33.295 --> 04:36.230
<i>life-changing piles of cash.</i>
- See, to me, the allure

04:36.298 --> 04:38.466
is, like, you're just going week
to week without any commitment.

04:38.534 --> 04:41.002
You drop in, you drop out.
Yeah, it sounds perfect for you.

04:41.069 --> 04:43.404
While the rest of us
have shown a proclivity

04:43.472 --> 04:46.107
for commitment, you're like the
Draft Kings of relationships.

04:46.175 --> 04:48.609
You're in one week and then out the next.
- Pete,

04:48.677 --> 04:50.878
you're missing out on the wonderful
world of commitment. I mean,

04:50.946 --> 04:52.680
trust me,
you don't know what I have.

04:52.748 --> 04:54.148
He's had what you have.

04:54.216 --> 04:55.616
Tell you what,
why don't you and I check in

04:55.684 --> 04:57.385
at the end of the season
and we'll see who's happier.

04:57.452 --> 04:59.153
Ooh, I'll take that bet.
Pinky swear?

04:59.221 --> 05:01.301
I will not touch your pinky,
but I will take the bet.

05:01.356 --> 05:05.493
All right. Andre, your place
is... ridiculous.

05:05.561 --> 05:06.694
Thank you.

05:06.762 --> 05:07.995
But don't you think
we would just be

05:08.063 --> 05:10.398
more comfortable watching
the games back at our place?

05:10.465 --> 05:12.033
I thought you guys said you
were sick of us being there.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.601
We are.
Absolutely. We are. We are. We are.

05:13.669 --> 05:16.737
It's just so much easier.
We don't have to get a babysitter.

05:16.805 --> 05:19.173
Get an Uber home.
You don't have to get a babysitter.

05:19.241 --> 05:21.576
I mean, Ellie's, like, all grown
up... I mean, have you seen her?

05:21.643 --> 05:23.678
Of course we've seen her.
She's our daughter, dum-dum.

05:23.745 --> 05:26.113
She's, like, all... You know, she's...
What? What does she have?

05:26.181 --> 05:28.249
What is all that? What does that mean?
I mean, she's, like,

05:28.317 --> 05:31.052
developing and she's all there. She's...
She's developing?

05:31.119 --> 05:32.820
Excuse me?
Uh, you're putting words in my mouth.

05:32.888 --> 05:33.788
Disgusting, Andre.
I'm just saying that she...

05:33.855 --> 05:34.855
It's natural. She's got the...

05:34.923 --> 05:35.856
No, no, no,
no, no, no.

05:35.924 --> 05:37.191
You talking about this

05:37.259 --> 05:39.493
is incredibly unnatural.

05:39.561 --> 05:40.962
I'm not saying
I want to get with her.

05:41.029 --> 05:42.429
I mean,
I already have a girlfriend.

05:42.464 --> 05:44.131
Oh, you know what, okay... Oh, okay!
What?

05:44.199 --> 05:45.132
Andre!
Guys, come on.

05:45.200 --> 05:46.267
You're the worst.
Good-bye.

05:46.335 --> 05:47.368
What are you doing?
Where are you going?

05:47.436 --> 05:48.603
Guys,
what was I supposed to say,

05:48.670 --> 05:49.804
that I <i> do</i> want to have sex
with her?

05:49.871 --> 05:51.973
That seems worse!

05:57.518 --> 05:59.715
Great. I'll take
my golf clubs back, please.

05:59.828 --> 06:03.064
No, I took those as payment
for your EBDB Prime account.

06:03.132 --> 06:05.033
I d... I don't have
an EBDB Prime account.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.934
You have an EBDB Prime account.

06:07.002 --> 06:08.269
I... Then cancel it.
I don't want it anymore.

06:08.337 --> 06:10.371
If you want to cancel,
you're gonna need to log on.

06:10.439 --> 06:12.707
What's your password?
Just give me back my golf clubs.

06:12.775 --> 06:14.409
If you can't remember your
password, we're gonna have

06:14.476 --> 06:17.478
to start the retrieval process.
Oh, my God.

06:17.546 --> 06:19.714
Can you read these letters
to me, sir?

06:21.450 --> 06:23.451
No, I can't.
This is nothing, Taco.

06:23.519 --> 06:25.053
Gupta wrote those down.
I think they're in Sanskrit.

06:25.120 --> 06:27.889
He also drinks,
so I can't be sure.

06:27.956 --> 06:30.625
I'm gonna put you on hold, sir.
No, no, no!

06:38.500 --> 06:39.801
Taco!

06:39.868 --> 06:41.135
Thank you for holding, sir.

06:41.203 --> 06:42.537
I'm Taco with Customer Service.

06:42.604 --> 06:43.871
How's your day going today?

06:43.939 --> 06:45.773
Shitty!
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

06:45.841 --> 06:49.343
Let's go ahead and reset your
account, sir. I'm gonna send you

06:49.411 --> 06:53.247
a security code, and I'm gonna
need you to read it back to me.

06:53.315 --> 06:57.852
You should be receiving
it right... now.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.120
"U-8-7-E

06:59.188 --> 07:01.923
"pooping elephant 497

07:01.990 --> 07:03.124
penis."

07:03.192 --> 07:04.659
Smiley face.

07:04.727 --> 07:05.927
That is correct, sir.

07:05.994 --> 07:07.829
Now that we've confirmed
your identity,

07:07.896 --> 07:09.163
I'm gonna need you to enter

07:09.231 --> 07:10.364
a new password.

07:10.432 --> 07:12.133
you!

07:12.201 --> 07:13.234
You're gonna need
a different one.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.235
Ruxin's using that.

07:14.303 --> 07:16.070
Oh, go yourself.

07:16.138 --> 07:18.139
That's Andre's.

07:18.207 --> 07:20.742
<i>So, what's going</i> on

07:20.809 --> 07:23.611
in the, uh, police state
of Big Brother Ruxin house?

07:23.679 --> 07:25.213
Pretty sweet.
I did a little research,

07:25.280 --> 07:26.614
found myself a blind spot.

07:28.250 --> 07:29.517
Okay. In.

07:29.585 --> 07:31.953
<i>Where is there a blind spot?</i>

07:32.020 --> 07:33.721
In. Out.

07:33.789 --> 07:35.690
<i>It's behind the couch,</i>

07:35.758 --> 07:37.458
<i>it's away from the cameras,</i>

07:37.526 --> 07:40.128
<i>and I am living a life</i>
<i>of great freedom and luxury.</i>

07:40.195 --> 07:41.729
The blind spot.

07:41.797 --> 07:43.030
<i>Wait... Isn't that</i>

07:43.098 --> 07:45.533
Rafi's old pee corner?
Don't care.

07:45.601 --> 07:47.468
Hey, Kev, can I talk to you
for a sec?

07:47.536 --> 07:49.303
Yeah. Sure.

07:49.371 --> 07:50.705
Hey.
Yeah?

07:50.773 --> 07:52.206
I can't get in on your computer.

07:52.274 --> 07:53.808
Did you change your password?
No.

07:53.876 --> 07:55.376
Taco made me change my password

07:55.444 --> 07:57.478
for that stupid
EBDB Prime thing.

07:57.546 --> 07:59.280
I don't know. He probably
changed it on all my devices.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.349
I'll-I'll put it in.
All right, well, can I get your new one?

08:01.416 --> 08:04.118
Mm... yeah, I'll-I'll just...
I'm gonna throw it in.

08:04.186 --> 08:07.088
Just give me your... What-what are you doing?
What?

08:07.156 --> 08:08.689
Just give me... give me your password.
No.

08:08.757 --> 08:09.791
Babe, I'll...
Kevin...

08:09.858 --> 08:11.292
No. You know what? No.

08:11.360 --> 08:13.161
We're at the start
of a new season.

08:13.228 --> 08:14.629
I want to create
some boundaries.

08:14.696 --> 08:16.631
You have your team
on your computer

08:16.698 --> 08:18.566
with your password,
and I have my team

08:18.634 --> 08:20.334
on my computer with my password.

08:20.402 --> 08:22.737
Wow. -Okay? Jets and the Giants
don't trade playbooks.

08:22.805 --> 08:24.572
They know Belichick
will steal them both.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.174
Is that really
what it is, Kevin?

08:26.241 --> 08:28.201
Babe, I... It's not like
I'm doing anything wrong.

08:28.243 --> 08:30.645
Your voice is going so high.
- Wrong.

08:30.712 --> 08:31.913
Wro... wrong!

08:31.980 --> 08:33.514
Wrong.

08:41.890 --> 08:44.458
Nudie mags!

08:44.526 --> 08:46.727
Oh, vodka, too!

08:46.795 --> 08:49.063
Oh, hello, whipped cream,

08:49.131 --> 08:51.532
and, you, my Ding Dongs.

08:54.570 --> 08:59.040
Let me check on Rodney.

08:59.107 --> 09:01.175
Hmm?

09:01.243 --> 09:04.545
Nobody's home.

09:04.613 --> 09:07.081
♪ Ding Dongs, whipped cream,
Ding Dongs, whipped cream ♪

09:07.149 --> 09:09.917
♪ Ding Dongs, whipped cream,
Ding Dongs, whipped cream! ♪

09:09.985 --> 09:12.787
♪ In my blind spot!
In my blind spot! ♪

09:12.855 --> 09:15.890
♪ I've got Ding Dongs
and whipped cream! ♪

09:23.599 --> 09:25.800
Mmm!

09:25.868 --> 09:27.568
Whipped cream appetizer.

09:27.636 --> 09:30.504
A little bounce test
main course.

09:30.572 --> 09:32.206
Maybe a little whipped cream
for dessert.

09:36.945 --> 09:38.779
Oh, dick,
I'm giving you a treat.

09:38.847 --> 09:40.648
Oh, little Rodney.

09:43.819 --> 09:47.088
Oh, bounce test.
Oh, blind spot.

09:47.155 --> 09:48.422
Oh, freedom!

09:48.490 --> 09:53.561
Vinegar strokes forever!
Whipped <i> cream!</i>

09:55.731 --> 09:57.231
Goddamn it, I'm alive!

09:59.635 --> 10:01.669
Hello, Taco.

10:01.737 --> 10:04.138
Can I please have our new
EBDB Prime password?

10:04.206 --> 10:06.340
Ah. Password retrieval.

10:06.408 --> 10:08.309
Yes. -Well, I'm gonna have to ask you
a few security questions.

10:08.377 --> 10:09.777
Great. Hit me.
All right.

10:09.845 --> 10:12.747
What year did Kevin lose
interest in you sexually?

10:12.814 --> 10:15.049
Never. He...
It hasn't happened.

10:15.117 --> 10:16.217
That is incorrect.

10:16.285 --> 10:17.785
Who did Kevin <i> really</i>
want to marry?

10:17.853 --> 10:19.773
Ugh! You know what, Taco? Just...
No, no, no, no.

10:19.788 --> 10:21.756
No, only authorized
personnel back here.

10:21.823 --> 10:24.058
You can't just... I...
Shh.

10:24.126 --> 10:26.394
Okay, we are in here somewhere.

10:26.461 --> 10:27.662
Thank you.

10:27.729 --> 10:30.631
Kevin's password is

10:30.699 --> 10:33.167
"Dick Chicken?"
Uh-huh.

10:33.235 --> 10:35.369
Ooh. Does that have
to do with me?

10:35.437 --> 10:36.804
Don't flatter yourself.

10:36.872 --> 10:38.306
How is that flattering, Taco?

10:38.373 --> 10:40.341
It's some stupid thing that
Pete used to do in high school.

10:40.409 --> 10:42.109
I'm sorry?
Look, dick chicken is

10:42.177 --> 10:44.645
when two guys pull out
their dicks, charge towards

10:44.713 --> 10:45.980
each other, and...
Ew! What?!

10:46.048 --> 10:48.149
Hey, while you're here,
can I sign you up

10:48.216 --> 10:50.351
for EBDB Prime Fresh Direct?

10:50.419 --> 10:53.120
I deliver you food
from your own fridge in minutes.

10:57.459 --> 11:00.194
<i>Football is back,</i>

11:00.262 --> 11:01.896
thank goodness!
Yeah!

11:01.964 --> 11:04.198
I can't believe that
Tom Brady's playing.

11:04.266 --> 11:06.067
I mean, the guy
destroyed his cell phone.

11:06.134 --> 11:07.735
I love Brady.
He's just like, "No.

11:07.803 --> 11:09.136
"I cheat. I don't
give a.

11:09.204 --> 11:10.938
"I'm better-looking than
you, I got a better life.

11:11.006 --> 11:12.239
Suck it."
Yeah, I mean,

11:12.307 --> 11:13.507
it's exciting Brady's playing,
but look who's reffing.

11:13.575 --> 11:14.709
It's Bill Vinovich.

11:14.776 --> 11:17.078
He ran Super Bowl 49, the best.

11:17.145 --> 11:18.145
No one cares.

11:18.213 --> 11:19.146
No one cares about a ref?
No.

11:19.214 --> 11:21.515
Ooh. Ruxin,
check this out.

11:21.583 --> 11:23.617
Markus Wheaton
putting up a big old goose egg.

11:23.685 --> 11:26.454
Bam! It's over, bae.

11:26.521 --> 11:29.490
Let's just see how the second
half of the first quarter goes.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.359
Goose Egg.
All right.

11:31.426 --> 11:33.260
Did you just lay an egg?
Yeah.

11:33.328 --> 11:35.196
Give up.
Uh, anyone else have someone playing tonight?

11:35.263 --> 11:36.430
Yeah.

11:36.498 --> 11:37.631
I got Julian Edelman.
Ah.

11:37.699 --> 11:39.333
Julian Edelman?
- Oh, that's right.

11:39.401 --> 11:41.335
Yeah.
I forgot about your shit storm of a line up.

11:41.403 --> 11:42.603
I have never seen

11:42.671 --> 11:44.038
a weaker receiving core.
What?

11:44.106 --> 11:45.506
Edelman's gonna do great.

11:45.574 --> 11:48.042
Your number one receiver is a slot receiver.
Yeah.

11:48.110 --> 11:49.744
Are you slot-shaming
me right now?

11:49.811 --> 11:50.978
I'm just saying,

11:51.046 --> 11:52.980
if you send your line-up out
looking like that,

11:53.048 --> 11:54.915
I mean, you got
to take what you get.

11:54.983 --> 11:56.384
I'm proud of my team.

11:56.451 --> 11:57.572
Sure.
They're gonna be great.

11:57.619 --> 11:59.353
Sure.
- Hey, what is this?

11:59.421 --> 12:00.788
Hi.
- See, this is

12:00.856 --> 12:02.923
why I hate
watching the games at the bar.

12:02.991 --> 12:04.392
This place has zero chill,

12:04.459 --> 12:05.939
but you know who has
mega chill vibes?

12:05.994 --> 12:07.261
My place.

12:07.329 --> 12:08.729
Let's bro out, chill down,

12:08.797 --> 12:09.797
and do it to the top.
- No.

12:09.865 --> 12:11.766
We got to do it city-style.
My house.

12:11.833 --> 12:13.534
I made a new recipe of hummus.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.302
It's great...
- No!

12:15.370 --> 12:16.404
No.
- No, no, no. No, no, no.

12:16.471 --> 12:18.572
We're having it
at our place, okay.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.041
Look, you can't
just determine it.

12:20.108 --> 12:21.876
We need an impartial judge to
figure out where it should be.

12:21.943 --> 12:23.711
God, where you gonna find that?
That's really hard to...

12:23.779 --> 12:25.279
Oh!
It's almost like you need like a...

12:25.347 --> 12:26.347
Yes, a ref.
Just...

12:26.415 --> 12:27.782
A ref!

12:27.849 --> 12:29.417
Where would we find
one of those,

12:29.484 --> 12:31.519
and who would care
if we found one anyway?

12:31.586 --> 12:32.953
Oh, this is hard.

12:33.021 --> 12:34.088
You just ref this.
You're a ref.

12:34.156 --> 12:35.356
Please make a decision for us.

12:35.357 --> 12:37.258
Well... okay.

12:37.325 --> 12:39.260
Tell you what: I'm gonna
go get myself a beer

12:39.327 --> 12:40.461
and think on it.

12:40.529 --> 12:41.689
Well, I'll buy you one.
Uh-uh.

12:41.730 --> 12:42.930
The ref cannot be
bought, my friend.

12:42.998 --> 12:44.065
You know what?

12:44.132 --> 12:45.733
A beer actually
sounds wonderful.

12:45.801 --> 12:48.803
Awesome. I will
take a...

12:48.870 --> 12:50.738
Hey, I'll take another one,
please.

12:52.841 --> 12:53.841
Peter.

12:53.909 --> 12:55.009
Hi.
I am just

12:55.077 --> 12:57.511
so happy that you have
really found

12:57.579 --> 12:59.246
your way in the world,

12:59.314 --> 13:01.248
and you love this reffing
so much. I'm just...

13:01.316 --> 13:03.717
Jenny, flattery... like
a plunging neckline...

13:03.785 --> 13:05.219
does not really suit you.

13:05.287 --> 13:07.121
Can I do something for you?

13:07.189 --> 13:10.891
Well, if you choose to let us
watch the games at our place,

13:10.959 --> 13:13.794
I won't slaughter you
on the message boards

13:13.862 --> 13:17.798
by telling everyone that
you used to play dick chicken.

13:17.866 --> 13:19.166
Oh, my God,
you finally found out

13:19.234 --> 13:20.367
that I used to
play dick chicken.

13:20.435 --> 13:23.137
Yes, I did.
With Kevin.

13:23.205 --> 13:25.940
What?
What? You didn't know?

13:26.007 --> 13:28.609
No. -Who did you think I was
playing dick chicken with?

13:28.677 --> 13:31.712
Yourself!
No, it takes two dicks to chicken, lady.

13:31.780 --> 13:33.814
I don't...
What did you think the game was?

13:33.882 --> 13:36.016
You just running around

13:36.084 --> 13:38.652
like a chicken with your head
cut off, yelling, "Dick!"

13:38.720 --> 13:41.188
It's not that.

13:41.256 --> 13:42.556
Kevin!

13:42.624 --> 13:43.991
Thank you.

13:44.059 --> 13:45.960
You were the other half
of dick chicken?!

13:46.027 --> 13:47.394
What?

13:47.462 --> 13:49.430
You, Pete.

13:49.498 --> 13:51.198
It's anatomically generous.

13:51.266 --> 13:53.767
No, it was just kids being kids,

13:53.835 --> 13:55.136
playing stupid games.
Aah!

13:55.203 --> 13:56.370
Whamming your dicks together?

13:56.438 --> 13:58.272
Ah, don't worry,
it's just kids and dicks.

13:58.340 --> 13:59.573
You're making a big deal out of if.
Well, folks,

13:59.641 --> 14:01.208
clearly, we're gonna
see the games

14:01.276 --> 14:03.377
at Kevin and Jenny's.
It is decided.

14:03.445 --> 14:05.613
Oh!
Ow!

14:05.680 --> 14:07.448
Do you always carry that whistle with you?
Yeah, I'm a ref.

14:07.516 --> 14:10.751
Just, enough with the
stupid refereeing, Pete.

14:10.819 --> 14:12.720
It's lame and no one cares.
What did you... What... How...

14:12.787 --> 14:13.754
What did you say?
It's what?

14:13.822 --> 14:14.822
It's lame!

14:14.890 --> 14:15.789
Stop it!
Stop.

14:15.857 --> 14:17.424
Unsportsmanlike!
Unsportsmanlike!

14:17.492 --> 14:19.160
Excuse me, is anyone here
a ref? I heard a whistle.

14:19.227 --> 14:20.728
I am.

14:20.795 --> 14:22.730
Unbelievable.
- You are? Yeah.

14:22.797 --> 14:25.733
We are having an argument
over there over that last play.

14:25.800 --> 14:28.135
Yeah. -Can you please explain to me
why that wasn't holding?

14:28.203 --> 14:29.537
I can.
Come on, come with me.

14:29.604 --> 14:31.138
What do you know about

14:31.206 --> 14:32.306
offensive line play?

14:32.374 --> 14:33.908
I could use a little refresher.
Okay,

14:33.975 --> 14:35.009
all right.
Give me your hands.

14:35.076 --> 14:36.377
Stick 'em right here.
Okay.

14:36.444 --> 14:37.511
Go ahead. All right, see,

14:37.579 --> 14:38.819
any time you're inside the pits,

14:38.847 --> 14:40.447
this is totally legal, okay?
Inside the pits?

14:40.515 --> 14:42.183
Yeah, inside the pit area.
Okay.

14:42.250 --> 14:43.984
But there are other places
you can put your hands

14:44.052 --> 14:45.252
which are highly illegal.

14:45.320 --> 14:48.422
Oh, well, we could probably
work our way up to that.

14:48.490 --> 14:50.224
Yeah, maybe we could.

14:50.292 --> 14:52.493
I'm Livi.
I'm Pete. Nice to meet you.

14:52.561 --> 14:54.195
Total slut.

14:54.262 --> 14:56.163
Her?
No, him.

14:59.961 --> 15:01.695
<i>So you're not coming over
until you're done tinkering,</i>

15:01.763 --> 15:03.030
which is, basically, never.

15:03.098 --> 15:04.698
You got part of that right.

15:04.766 --> 15:06.834
I got the crudités
on camera and in

15:06.901 --> 15:10.104
the blind spot I got
all my little snackies.

15:10.171 --> 15:11.939
We got a new backyard patio set.

15:12.007 --> 15:13.107
Uh, no, thank you.

15:13.174 --> 15:15.042
I'm gonna wallow here
in week one like

15:15.110 --> 15:17.311
a frat pledge in his own sick.

15:17.379 --> 15:19.079
All right, well,
we won't miss you. Bye.

15:22.117 --> 15:23.717
All right, lineups are locked.

15:23.785 --> 15:25.185
Let's see what
the Lady MacArthurs

15:25.253 --> 15:27.288
have in store for me here.
I'm feeling good, Peter.

15:27.355 --> 15:28.789
We got Julian Edelman, slot.

15:28.857 --> 15:30.291
Randall Cobb, slot.

15:30.358 --> 15:31.625
Percy Harvin, slot.

15:31.693 --> 15:32.826
Wow!

15:32.894 --> 15:35.262
This may be the slottiest lineup
I've ever seen.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.864
It's, like, just riddled with

15:36.931 --> 15:39.199
tramp stamps and Goldschlager.

15:39.267 --> 15:40.834
Hey, just take it easy,
Dick Chicken.

15:40.902 --> 15:42.436
I'm sorry, you talking to me
or you talking to your husband?

15:42.504 --> 15:44.071
Okay, 'cause at least I won.

15:44.139 --> 15:45.873
What? Excuse me?

15:45.940 --> 15:47.374
Excuse you.
You did <i> not</i> win.

15:47.442 --> 15:49.443
Uh, I <i> did</i> win.
You chickened out.

15:49.511 --> 15:51.512
Are you kidding me? I went
towards you and I slipped,

15:51.579 --> 15:52.979
for a second.
Oh, that's what people

15:52.981 --> 15:54.214
who chicken out say... they say, "I slipped."
No.

15:54.282 --> 15:56.317
Just take me back a sec.
Did you guys get hard

15:56.384 --> 15:57.885
before playing dick chicken?

15:57.952 --> 16:00.421
Yeah.
No. What... Well, I mean, it depends who has

16:00.488 --> 16:01.955
home-field advantage.
The game was, it was like a...

16:02.023 --> 16:03.357
American League-National League
thing. It was the same game,

16:03.425 --> 16:04.391
just different rules.

16:04.459 --> 16:05.526
Whatever.
Yeah, it-it's hard...

16:05.593 --> 16:06.960
Yes, yes, yes!
Look at this! Here we go!

16:07.028 --> 16:09.997
Here we go.
Week one, and we are back.

16:10.065 --> 16:11.365
Hey. Kevin...
Uh...

16:11.433 --> 16:12.466
you sat on the remote, dude.

16:12.534 --> 16:13.574
Nope.
It's right over here.

16:13.635 --> 16:14.835
Well, turn it on.

16:14.903 --> 16:16.203
I <i> am</i> turning it on.

16:16.271 --> 16:17.338
Kevin...

16:17.405 --> 16:18.972
Wait. Oh, no.
I'm putting it on.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.374
Oh, no, oh, no, hold on.
Hold on, relax.

16:20.442 --> 16:22.362
What did you do?
I don't... I didn't do anything.

16:22.377 --> 16:24.144
I told you... get an A/V guy.
I...

16:24.212 --> 16:25.779
Guys, guys, guys.
TV's out in here, too.

16:25.847 --> 16:27.214
What?
What? Oh, my God.

16:27.282 --> 16:29.049
Taco, why is the DirecTV out?

16:29.117 --> 16:31.585
You're welcome.
I canceled your DirecTV,

16:31.653 --> 16:34.621
since EBDB Prime is now
your primary content provider.

16:34.689 --> 16:35.656
No, it is not.
What?

16:35.724 --> 16:37.124
Fear not.
We are creating our own

16:37.192 --> 16:39.226
exclusive,
cutting-edge content...

16:39.294 --> 16:40.427
check this out.

16:42.964 --> 16:44.124
You guys are gonna like this.

16:44.132 --> 16:46.100
Hi, there. I'm Taco.

16:46.167 --> 16:48.635
And I'm making... tacos.

16:48.703 --> 16:50.170
Taco...

16:50.238 --> 16:51.205
tacos.

16:51.272 --> 16:54.174
And this is <i> Taco Making Tacos.</i>

16:54.242 --> 16:55.943
I'm making tacos.

16:56.010 --> 16:57.511
♪ Oh, who's making tacos? ♪

16:57.579 --> 16:59.213
♪ Taco's making tacos,
tacos here ♪

16:59.280 --> 17:00.781
♪ Tacos there ♪

17:00.849 --> 17:02.483
Guys, kitchen TV is out, too.

17:02.550 --> 17:04.550
Oh, goddamn it.
Taco, listen to me,

17:04.618 --> 17:06.587
I canceled that
stupid EBDB Prime.

17:06.654 --> 17:08.422
No, you did not. You changed
your password, but you

17:08.490 --> 17:10.089
forgot to log on to
cancel the service.

17:10.157 --> 17:11.325
Oh, you know what, Taco?

17:11.393 --> 17:13.327
Your service is canceled.

17:13.395 --> 17:15.028
Your attic slumber
parties... canceled.

17:15.096 --> 17:16.829
Toilets... canceled.

17:16.897 --> 17:19.066
What about the side yard by the chimney?
Oop! Canceled!

17:19.134 --> 17:21.101
Kevin, just call the babysitter.
Let's get out of this shithole.

17:21.169 --> 17:22.669
Let's go.

17:22.737 --> 17:23.771
Guys, what are we gonna do?
We got to figure something out!

17:23.838 --> 17:25.204
Get to the car,
we'll decide there!

17:25.272 --> 17:28.842
People ask me if the food
taco is named after me, Taco.

17:28.910 --> 17:31.645
Well, what they don't know is
that my real name is not Taco.

17:31.713 --> 17:33.247
It's actually...

17:33.314 --> 17:35.149
Oh, come on.
- Where is he?

17:35.216 --> 17:36.884
Oh, thank God. Come on...
Ah, ah, ah, ah!

17:36.951 --> 17:38.452
Let us in.
Their Sunday Ticket's out.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.586
By the time we get
to a sports bar,

17:39.654 --> 17:41.188
there'll be no more seats left.

17:41.256 --> 17:43.424
Ruxin,
it's Bears-Packers!

17:43.491 --> 17:45.993
Fine, you can come in.
On one condition.

17:47.896 --> 17:49.730
Thanks for the chill
hangout, bro.

17:49.798 --> 17:51.432
Real relax-fest.

17:51.499 --> 17:54.435
I want nothing more than to
bro down with my chill dudes

17:54.502 --> 17:56.937
and my gal pals, but no one
is allowed to be here,

17:57.005 --> 17:58.806
so if you want to watch
the rest of the Bears game,

17:58.873 --> 18:01.875
you will stand back there and
you will respect the blind spot.

18:01.943 --> 18:03.644
Fine.
Why is the floor all sticky back here, Ruxin?

18:03.711 --> 18:05.179
What else have you been doing?

18:05.246 --> 18:06.914
Everything under the sun.

18:06.981 --> 18:08.415
Oh, Jesus. Oh, God.
What?

18:08.483 --> 18:09.917
Be careful which beer you drink,

18:09.984 --> 18:11.952
because... I ran out
of hand towels.

18:13.388 --> 18:15.489
I don't trust him.
Okay, Mommy,

18:15.557 --> 18:17.037
I know that you don't
trust him,<i> pero,</i>

18:17.058 --> 18:19.827
I do.<i> Mira, mira.</i>
Too much with the footballs.

18:19.894 --> 18:20.994
Too much with the friends.

18:21.062 --> 18:22.262
Well, they're not there.

18:22.330 --> 18:24.097
He's being a good boy.

18:24.165 --> 18:26.066
Your taste is in the toilet.

18:26.134 --> 18:28.168
That's where your taste is.

18:28.236 --> 18:29.970
How is Randall Cobb doing?
Oh, he is

18:30.038 --> 18:32.306
slotting it up and down
the field like a Mormon girl

18:32.373 --> 18:33.907
at a non-Mormon university.

18:33.975 --> 18:36.043
That's my boy.
Andre, what are you doing?

18:36.110 --> 18:37.344
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

18:37.412 --> 18:38.579
I heard everybody...

18:38.646 --> 18:40.581
was watching the game.

18:40.648 --> 18:42.950
Just... Oh, come on.
Oh, God.

18:43.017 --> 18:44.418
Now you're gonna have to
cram in here with us.

18:44.486 --> 18:45.619
Oh, no problem.

18:45.687 --> 18:47.187
Ugh! God, what did you eat?

18:47.255 --> 18:48.755
Actually, something
of my own recipe.

18:48.823 --> 18:51.091
It's a salmon-flavored tempeh.
Okay, get out of here,

18:51.159 --> 18:53.961
get out of here.
Get out of here.

18:54.028 --> 18:55.629
Do you know what?
He's not our kind.

18:55.697 --> 18:56.697
Oh, Mommy, please.

18:56.764 --> 18:57.965
That's the problem.

18:58.032 --> 18:59.833
I think he gave <i> Papi</i> the stroke.

18:59.901 --> 19:01.001
How could you say that?
I know it.

19:01.069 --> 19:03.070
How's Sammy Watkins doing?
I only have one bar.

19:03.137 --> 19:05.873
Ooh, you guys corner-spotting?

19:05.940 --> 19:07.741
Oh, you know what, Taco,
this is all your fault.

19:07.809 --> 19:09.849
What?
We're canceling the stupid EBDB Prime service,

19:09.878 --> 19:11.311
do you hear me?
Here we are.

19:11.379 --> 19:13.180
Okay, you're gonna have to log
in to your account...

19:13.248 --> 19:14.748
Oh, you know what, just stop. Hey!
Hey...

19:14.816 --> 19:15.983
Don't push me.
Stop pushing.

19:16.050 --> 19:17.751
Who's push... Stop it!
Somebody pushed me.

19:17.819 --> 19:19.319
Stop acting like children...
Sofia's watching!

19:19.387 --> 19:21.121
Don't worry about it.
Just put this

19:21.189 --> 19:22.222
in front of the camera

19:22.290 --> 19:23.357
and she won't be able to tell.

19:23.424 --> 19:25.192
I'm praying for Dad every day.
I know...

19:25.260 --> 19:28.262
Lighting a candle when you
take a bath is no prayer.

19:28.329 --> 19:30.631
God is everywhere.
God is everywhere, but not in the bathtub.

19:30.698 --> 19:32.432
Pull it out! Respect
the blind spot!

19:32.500 --> 19:33.667
This is a chillaxing
environment.

19:33.735 --> 19:35.269
As long as you respect
the blind spot you can

19:35.336 --> 19:37.471
hang out here, but it's got to
be a chillaxing respectfully

19:37.539 --> 19:40.474
of the blind spot!

19:40.542 --> 19:41.842
Aw, see?

19:41.910 --> 19:43.877
Look at his sweet smile.

19:43.945 --> 19:45.312
It's creepy.

19:45.380 --> 19:46.613
He scare me.

19:48.144 --> 19:49.812
Oh, great... Sammy Watkins shit
the bed and now it looks like

19:49.880 --> 19:51.983
I'm gonna lose to Russell.
- Yup.

19:52.103 --> 19:54.238
Seabiscuit squirted out
a victory and you

19:54.305 --> 19:56.840
got to watch it float away in the ocean.
Ugh...

19:56.908 --> 19:58.242
Sorry you lost.

19:58.309 --> 19:59.793
Like you lost at dick chicken.

19:59.913 --> 20:02.161
Well, I wouldn't know, because
I didn't lose at dick chicken.

20:02.281 --> 20:03.642
Uh, you chickened out,
so you lost.

20:03.681 --> 20:04.948
No, I didn't chicken out, okay?

20:05.016 --> 20:06.550
Define "chickening out",

20:06.618 --> 20:08.085
'cause it really
could go either way.

20:08.153 --> 20:09.553
Actually, define "winning"
while you're at it, too.

20:09.621 --> 20:10.921
Why don't you ask Kevin
what winning is,

20:10.989 --> 20:12.723
'cause it's what I did
to him in dick chicken.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.324
No, you did not win, okay?
And if you think

20:14.392 --> 20:16.393
that you could win,
I challenge you to a rematch.

20:16.461 --> 20:17.501
No!
I am so fine with that.

20:17.562 --> 20:18.428
No!
Me, too.

20:18.496 --> 20:19.696
No head-to-head contact.

20:19.764 --> 20:21.999
It could cause a concoction.
Oh, it's on.

20:22.066 --> 20:23.867
It's on like Dong Kong. No!
- No!

20:23.935 --> 20:25.903
I love it. Look.
What the hell?

20:25.970 --> 20:28.739
Who are those people?
What are they doing?

20:28.806 --> 20:29.773
Wh-What's going on?

20:29.841 --> 20:31.208
Stop, stop, stop!
No, no, no!

20:31.276 --> 20:32.409
Guys, respect

20:32.477 --> 20:33.744
the blind spot.
You ready?

20:33.811 --> 20:34.912
I'm ready.
- No.

20:34.979 --> 20:36.547
Oh!

20:38.583 --> 20:40.884
Mom!

20:40.952 --> 20:42.419
Rodney's having a gay orgy.

20:42.487 --> 20:43.587
Respect the blind spot!

20:43.655 --> 20:45.055
No! I can't look.

20:45.123 --> 20:46.857
Don't worry, Ruxin, I got this.

20:46.925 --> 20:48.892
<i>Ay dios mio,</i> look
at the pee-pees.

20:48.960 --> 20:50.594
Rodney!

20:50.662 --> 20:52.229
Oh, you didn't slip!

20:52.297 --> 20:53.263
You didn't slip!

20:53.331 --> 20:55.966
Oh, helmet-to-helmet contact!

20:56.034 --> 20:58.468
Oh, forever unclean.

20:58.588 --> 21:09.077
