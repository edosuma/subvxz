WEBVTT

00:09.183 --> 00:11.489
Previously onChapelwaite...

00:11.620 --> 00:13.926
[Rebecca] I came across
these old letters

00:14.057 --> 00:15.667
between my father
and the Boones.

00:15.798 --> 00:17.408
He was their attorney.

00:17.539 --> 00:19.845
You knew he worked
for my uncle and cousin?

00:19.976 --> 00:21.717
[woman]
Jakub never loses a lamb.

00:21.847 --> 00:24.198
-I'm not goin' back.
-Oh, sweetheart.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.504
You never left.

00:26.635 --> 00:27.853
[Faith]
One of them came to me today.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.638
They know where I am.

00:29.768 --> 00:31.553
They know about you
and our baby.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.383
[Able] Your father,
there's a weight on him.

00:35.513 --> 00:36.993
I've seen it before.

00:37.124 --> 00:38.821
It's what drove Phillip
and Stephen crazy--

00:38.951 --> 00:41.432
-My father isn't mad!
-[Charles grunts]

00:41.563 --> 00:42.564
-[screaming]
-Charles, no!

00:42.694 --> 00:43.826
Charles, may I be frank?

00:43.956 --> 00:45.741
Yes, of course.

00:45.871 --> 00:47.308
Are the children and I
in danger...

00:47.438 --> 00:48.657
from you?

00:48.787 --> 00:51.268
Why are you not
hunting Stephen Boone!?

00:51.399 --> 00:53.009
Because he's dead, Rose.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.706
[Charles]
Stephen played me for a fool.

00:54.837 --> 00:56.795
He put my family in peril.

00:56.926 --> 00:59.537
I need to hunt him down
before he hurts anyone else.

00:59.668 --> 01:02.845
My cousin Stephen is living
inside the walls of this house.

01:02.975 --> 01:05.413
I'm gonna to capture him
before he can do any more harm.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.241
[Stephen]
Such a beautiful gift.

01:07.371 --> 01:08.851
Your mother has fine taste.

01:08.981 --> 01:10.635
I know that you're sad.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.333
And angry.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.552
You must feel very alone,
don't you?

01:14.683 --> 01:16.293
I know loneliness, too.

01:16.424 --> 01:17.686
-Stay away from her!
-[gunshot]

01:20.645 --> 01:21.777
[Loa] No!

01:23.996 --> 01:25.520
[Rebecca]
Phillip Boone is alive.

01:25.650 --> 01:26.782
He attacked Mary Dennison.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.655
Phillip Boone is dead!

01:30.786 --> 01:32.701
You there!

01:32.831 --> 01:35.747
-Jakub has the answers.
-What answers?

01:35.878 --> 01:38.315
To that madness you feel
growing inside of you.

01:38.446 --> 01:39.925
He wants to see you,
tomorrow,

01:40.056 --> 01:41.318
in Jerusalem's Lot.

01:41.449 --> 01:42.885
No!

02:04.124 --> 02:05.777
[man shouting]
Hurry! Hurry!

02:09.825 --> 02:11.261
[Silence] Father?

02:13.394 --> 02:14.351
Father!

02:15.439 --> 02:16.136
Stop!

02:17.441 --> 02:18.834
[man] Boone! Stop!

02:30.846 --> 02:32.500
What have you done?

02:32.630 --> 02:34.328
It's coming, Silence.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.330
I can't stop it.

02:36.460 --> 02:38.288
Put the knife down.

02:38.419 --> 02:39.985
I'm not crazy.

02:40.116 --> 02:42.466
Just put the knife down.

02:43.728 --> 02:45.165
I've seen it.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.559
What have you seen?

02:48.690 --> 02:50.039
The coming of the dark.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.563
That book is corrupt,Father.

02:52.694 --> 02:55.740
Look at what
it's done to you!

02:55.871 --> 02:57.568
I had to get the worms out.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.832
I couldn't allow
the ones I love

03:00.963 --> 03:03.226
to suffer this future.

03:04.619 --> 03:05.968
Give me the book.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.455
-Drop the knife, Father.
-Silence.

03:14.585 --> 03:15.499
Drop it.

03:16.935 --> 03:20.765
I'm sending you to God
before God dies.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.666
[Charles]
What did Stephen say to you?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.583
Did he say anything
about Jakub?

05:25.716 --> 05:27.065
Answer me, Loa.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.634
He said I could see Mother.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.245
Well, that's a lie.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.508
What he's saying to you
isn't true.

05:34.638 --> 05:35.813
How do you know?

05:37.337 --> 05:38.729
He's different than us.

05:46.607 --> 05:47.608
What does that mean?

05:51.263 --> 05:52.961
He said
he could make me well.

05:54.136 --> 05:55.442
Oh, he can't.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.018
Loa...

06:09.630 --> 06:12.850
Stephen is a deceiver.

06:12.981 --> 06:14.809
Remember, your mother and I

06:14.939 --> 06:16.550
spoke to you about such people.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.203
On ship and in port.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.206
He's not a stranger.
He's family.

06:21.337 --> 06:23.339
It doesn't matter.
He's preying on your weakness.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.515
Why is missing Mother
a weakness?

06:27.299 --> 06:29.824
Forgetting her is worse.

06:31.216 --> 06:32.696
No one's forgotten about her.

06:37.353 --> 06:39.529
I see the way
you look at Rebecca.

06:44.839 --> 06:48.843
No woman could ever take
the place of your mother,

06:48.973 --> 06:50.671
nor would I
ever ask that of you.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.811
I'm your father.

07:00.942 --> 07:04.772
It's my job to protect you.

07:04.902 --> 07:07.557
And I can't do that
if you disobey my orders.

07:10.125 --> 07:12.736
Stay away from Stephen Boone.
He means you harm.

07:12.867 --> 07:14.738
Could he do
any worse than this?

07:23.704 --> 07:25.793
We're leaving soon.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.011
Get packed.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.678
How is she?

07:41.809 --> 07:43.854
Stephen's manipulating her.

07:43.985 --> 07:46.422
To what end, I don't know.
She said nothing about Jakub?

07:46.553 --> 07:49.207
I saw that name
in those letters I found

07:49.338 --> 07:50.818
between the Boones
and my father.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.385
I know of Jerusalem's Lot.

07:53.516 --> 07:55.300
It was my great-grandfather's
mining town.

07:55.431 --> 07:57.738
People tell stories
about James Boone

07:57.868 --> 07:59.261
and those
who used to live there,

07:59.391 --> 08:01.089
mostly to scare the kids.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.264
I thought it was abandoned.

08:02.394 --> 08:05.136
How do I get there?

08:05.267 --> 08:07.878
I can take you.
It's a half day's ride.

08:08.009 --> 08:09.706
A couple years ago, I started
driving lumber up there

08:09.837 --> 08:11.926
for Phillip and Stephen.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.928
I was told to leave it
outside town.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.408
Never collected money
or saw anyone.

08:16.539 --> 08:19.194
Father, you saw
what that girl did.

08:19.324 --> 08:20.630
Let's leave this place.

08:25.243 --> 08:27.594
Able, Rebecca,
may I have a moment, please?

08:27.724 --> 08:28.508
Of course.

08:34.688 --> 08:35.906
Rebecca?

09:00.278 --> 09:01.671
Honor.

09:04.239 --> 09:08.025
You've seen me
less than myself.

09:08.156 --> 09:13.291
I'm really very concerned
about my condition,

09:13.422 --> 09:14.858
how that might affect yo ...

09:16.512 --> 09:19.210
...and Loa, Tane.

09:26.087 --> 09:29.351
If this Jakub has answers,

09:29.481 --> 09:31.832
I need to hear them.

10:34.068 --> 10:36.374
Don't worry about your father.
I'll look after him.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.771
Promise me you'll
take care of yourself, too.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.164
Of course.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.262
Children, I'll come for you
at the boarding house.

10:54.392 --> 10:55.916
Mind Rebecca.

10:56.046 --> 10:57.744
Watch each other
until I return.

10:57.874 --> 10:59.746
Be careful.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.791
I will.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.314
Honor...

11:21.985 --> 11:23.334
Rebecca...

11:25.467 --> 11:28.122
I can never repay you.

11:28.252 --> 11:30.777
We'll expect you
back tomorrow.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.213
Thank you.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.437
[Rebecca] Thank you.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.419
Rebecca Morgan
says Phillip Boone

12:04.549 --> 12:06.900
was in this room last night.

12:07.030 --> 12:08.989
She saw him attack Mary.

12:09.119 --> 12:12.035
Phillip Boone is dead,
George.

12:12.166 --> 12:13.907
Says who?

12:14.037 --> 12:16.431
Elizabeth Cloris?

12:16.561 --> 12:18.738
From the lack of bruising
around the punctures,

12:18.868 --> 12:21.088
I'd almost say that
they were bites of some sort.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.091
But not human.

12:25.614 --> 12:26.876
She never complained
about these wounds?

12:27.007 --> 12:28.312
No.

12:28.443 --> 12:31.054
The position
is either very lucky

12:31.185 --> 12:32.882
or quite strategic.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.057
For what?

12:34.188 --> 12:35.755
Bloodletting.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.498
How could I have missed
these before?

12:40.629 --> 12:42.239
You weren't meant
to find them.

12:46.417 --> 12:48.463
Mother? Come on in.

12:48.593 --> 12:50.639
Rebecca. Hello, children.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.423
[Honor] Hello, Mrs. Morgan.

12:52.554 --> 12:53.990
[Rebecca] Go on upstairs.
Second door on your right.

12:54.121 --> 12:55.122
Make yourselves at home.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.254
What's going on?

12:57.385 --> 12:59.561
We needed a place
to stay for a few days.

12:59.691 --> 13:00.562
[Rebecca's mother]
Where's their father?

13:00.692 --> 13:03.086
He's riding
for Jerusalem's Lot.

13:03.217 --> 13:06.263
Why is he doing that?
What's out there?

13:06.394 --> 13:08.483
This will sound mad,

13:08.613 --> 13:11.138
but it's not just
Phillip Boone who's alive.

13:11.268 --> 13:12.748
Stephen is, too.

13:12.879 --> 13:15.490
Charles saw him
alive last night.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.362
Father and son
faked their death

13:18.493 --> 13:20.582
and are living in the walls
of Chapelwaite.

13:20.712 --> 13:22.453
I need to see
those letters I gave you,

13:22.584 --> 13:24.891
the ones between Father
and the Boones.

13:28.372 --> 13:31.245
Why are the farms
around here all abandoned?

13:31.375 --> 13:33.073
I don't know.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.596
They weren't
a few years back.

13:38.556 --> 13:42.996
Rebecca mentioned stories
about my great-grandfather.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.171
What have you heard?

13:44.301 --> 13:45.476
People in Preacher's Corners

13:45.607 --> 13:48.218
can't make up their minds
about James Boone.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.004
I heard he was a killer.

13:51.134 --> 13:53.180
A ghost.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.834
Even the devil himself.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.944
Alice?

14:21.251 --> 14:22.339
Are you all right?

14:24.472 --> 14:27.431
I hate God.
[sighs]

14:27.562 --> 14:30.304
He's wicked...and cruel.

14:30.434 --> 14:32.132
He takes my babies,

14:32.262 --> 14:33.394
but delivers one
to the undeserving

14:33.524 --> 14:35.091
like Faith Pringle.

14:35.222 --> 14:37.311
It's natural
to question your faith,

14:37.441 --> 14:39.139
but you shouldn't compare
your situation to others.

14:39.269 --> 14:40.227
It's unbecoming.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.317
You know,
I wonder, Martin,

14:43.447 --> 14:46.711
why you let Marcella Boone
into our home.

14:46.842 --> 14:50.367
You need to stop this.

14:50.498 --> 14:53.544
Marcella Boone was not
the cause of the illness.

14:53.675 --> 14:57.287
I understand that you refuse
to accuse blindly, God forbid,

14:57.418 --> 15:00.421
but must you
defend so blindly?

15:00.551 --> 15:03.337
I never wanted that cursed
child around my babies.

15:03.467 --> 15:05.252
I begged you.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.341
But you let her.

15:07.471 --> 15:09.865
The children
adored her, Alice.

15:09.996 --> 15:12.259
I am not gonna have you
continuously blame me for--

15:16.611 --> 15:17.481
Say it.

15:19.396 --> 15:22.138
Say it, Martin.

15:22.269 --> 15:26.012
For the murder
of our children.

15:34.629 --> 15:38.415
I could love that child,
if it were ours.

15:38.546 --> 15:42.376
Even with all its ugliness,
I could still love it.

15:51.646 --> 15:54.736
Did you stray, Martin?

15:58.870 --> 16:01.047
Is it your child?

16:07.314 --> 16:08.576
It is.

16:29.553 --> 16:31.642
Last night,
people from Jerusalem's Lot

16:31.773 --> 16:32.600
came to Chapelwaite.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.863
What people?

16:34.994 --> 16:36.473
No one's lived there
for decades.

16:36.604 --> 16:38.301
They do now.

16:38.432 --> 16:40.651
They came with a message
for Charles.

16:40.782 --> 16:43.176
It seems this man named Jakub
wants to meet with him.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.699
Whoever this Jakub is,

16:44.829 --> 16:47.528
he wields the power of God
over these people.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.791
That's why I wanted to look
at these letters again.

16:49.921 --> 16:52.489
I saw his name
somewhere amongst them.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.274
Here it is. Jakub.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.755
It appears this Jakub

16:57.886 --> 16:59.844
contacted Father
in regards to a book:

16:59.975 --> 17:02.151
De Vermis Mysteriis.

17:02.282 --> 17:04.893
Heh. It's a peculiar name.

17:05.024 --> 17:08.157
It's Latin.
"Mysteries of the Worm."

17:17.993 --> 17:20.865
[man] Mrs. Boone?
It's George Dennison.

17:20.996 --> 17:23.303
-[boy] Help! Mother, please!
-Mrs. Boone?

17:23.433 --> 17:24.608
-[Mrs. Boone] Stop! Go away!
-[boy] Help!

17:24.739 --> 17:26.393
Leave here!
You can't save them!

17:26.523 --> 17:27.611
Please, Mother, no!

17:27.742 --> 17:29.265
-[gasp]
-No!

18:33.503 --> 18:35.114
Mr. Boone!

18:39.379 --> 18:40.510
Hello!

19:43.182 --> 19:44.661
[Able] There it is,
Mister Boone.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.446
Jerusalem's Lot.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.796
This is as far
as I ever came.

19:48.926 --> 19:50.624
You can see
the old church up there.

19:50.754 --> 19:51.842
They fixed that up
with Boone timber.

19:54.671 --> 19:58.632
Able, would you please ride
back to Preacher's Corners?

19:58.762 --> 20:00.503
Keep an eye on my family
until I return.

20:00.634 --> 20:01.939
-Mister Boone, I can come--
-No.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.204
Thank you.

21:47.131 --> 21:49.569
I'm here for Jakub.

21:51.919 --> 21:54.878
It says here Father brought
Jakub to Maine

21:55.009 --> 21:56.750
for a meeting
against the Boones' wishes.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.796
This was two years ago.

22:02.146 --> 22:03.322
Mother?

22:05.193 --> 22:06.325
What is it?

22:11.199 --> 22:13.201
What's that?

22:13.332 --> 22:16.509
A letter I received from
your father's second wife.

22:16.639 --> 22:17.988
I don't understand.

22:18.119 --> 22:18.815
What does that
have to do with any of this?

22:18.946 --> 22:20.643
She wanted to know

22:20.774 --> 22:22.950
if I'd reconciled
with your father.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.821
She hadn't seen
nor heard from him

22:24.952 --> 22:27.737
since he left
for business in Maine.

22:27.868 --> 22:31.524
So, Father set
his meeting in Maine...

22:31.654 --> 22:33.482
and never made it back
to New York?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.016
You'll be safe here, Mary.

22:55.852 --> 22:57.158
I love you.

22:58.289 --> 22:59.813
Sleep now.

23:42.986 --> 23:45.598
[Honor] Loa?

23:45.728 --> 23:47.817
What's wrong?

23:47.948 --> 23:49.123
[Tane] Is it Father?

23:49.253 --> 23:51.821
I want to go back
to the island.

23:51.952 --> 23:53.954
I want to be
with our people.

23:54.084 --> 23:56.783
Father will take us back.
After this, he won't stay.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.829
Yes, he will.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.442
He likes her.

24:05.705 --> 24:07.184
Who?

24:08.708 --> 24:11.711
Who do you think?Rebecca.

24:11.841 --> 24:14.322
We all do.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.150
Enough to call her "Mother"?

24:16.280 --> 24:17.891
Stop causing trouble.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.849
She's never been anything
but good to you.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.024
But she's a liar.

24:21.155 --> 24:21.851
She doesn't care
about any of us.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.592
Stop it, Loa.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.464
That's not true.

24:30.077 --> 24:31.252
Read for yourself.

24:33.863 --> 24:35.952
What is it?

24:36.083 --> 24:37.867
It's Rebecca's writings.

24:37.998 --> 24:41.175
It's about us.
We're all in it.

24:41.305 --> 24:43.351
She thinks we're cursed
and Father's mad.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.353
The only reason why she came
to Chapelwaite

24:45.484 --> 24:46.963
was to write
that stupid story.

24:54.231 --> 24:56.190
I wish you
hadn't taken this.

24:58.279 --> 25:01.021
Rebecca, I want you
to come back home now.

25:01.151 --> 25:02.805
Enough is enough.

25:02.936 --> 25:05.982
There's no story worth
putting your life in jeopardy.

25:06.113 --> 25:07.288
It's more than that.

25:07.418 --> 25:08.681
If it's the children,

25:08.811 --> 25:10.813
they're not
your responsibility.

25:10.944 --> 25:13.773
Charles Boone is capable
of taking care of...

25:17.298 --> 25:19.300
It's him, isn't it?

25:19.430 --> 25:20.954
You have feelings for him.

25:21.084 --> 25:23.391
I have feelings
for all of them.

25:23.522 --> 25:24.871
Does he share your affection?

25:27.090 --> 25:28.744
I don't know.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.877
But he's the most
interesting story

25:31.007 --> 25:33.357
that's ever
come into my life.

25:33.488 --> 25:35.838
He's a Boone.

25:35.969 --> 25:39.842
They are surrounded
by misfortune.

25:39.973 --> 25:43.019
Any sort of life with him
would be impossible.

25:48.068 --> 25:50.287
Good evening, Ann. Rebecca.

25:50.418 --> 25:52.028
I'm here to check
on Faith Pringle.

25:52.159 --> 25:54.117
She's upstairs.

25:54.248 --> 25:55.554
Thank you.

26:13.267 --> 26:14.311
He'll see you now.

26:28.499 --> 26:31.111
-What did Alice say?
-[Martin exhales]

26:31.241 --> 26:34.244
She said that I had, um,

26:34.375 --> 26:35.550
I had destroyed her,

26:35.681 --> 26:38.379
and that she hoped
to do the same for me.

26:38.509 --> 26:40.076
Then we have even
more reason to leave.

26:40.207 --> 26:42.209
Yes. I have to tell
my congregation.

26:42.339 --> 26:43.732
We don't have time.

26:43.863 --> 26:46.213
They confess their sins to me.

26:46.343 --> 26:48.302
What kind of a man am I if
I don't confess mine to them?

26:53.612 --> 26:55.657
You gave Alice the truth.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.101
You deserve the same.

27:09.584 --> 27:12.631
You know I'm not entirely
innocent, Martin.

27:14.981 --> 27:15.982
I told you I'm an orphan.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.768
It should be no surprise ...

27:19.899 --> 27:21.074
I survived my teens

27:21.204 --> 27:24.207
as a prostitute,
in New Bedford.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.211
[Faith] I knew many men.

27:30.126 --> 27:32.999
But one was unknowable.

27:34.130 --> 27:37.177
His name was Jakub
and he terrified me.

27:41.398 --> 27:43.444
The night we met,
I'm sure he meant to kill me,

27:43.574 --> 27:45.141
but he didn't.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.537
He needed food,
and I fed him.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.365
He needed shelter
and I provided.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.282
Jakub showed me many things.

27:57.284 --> 27:59.286
He shared his faith
in what he called

27:59.416 --> 28:01.941
"the original god."

28:02.071 --> 28:04.030
-There is only one God.
-And before Him?

28:04.160 --> 28:06.902
Before Jesus, before Satan,

28:07.033 --> 28:08.687
before "let there be light,"

28:08.817 --> 28:12.038
there was another
who ruled in darkness

28:12.168 --> 28:13.692
with no judgment.

28:15.563 --> 28:19.001
Jakub called him The Worm,

28:19.132 --> 28:22.396
and he was
on a quest to raise Him.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.924
I followed Jakub
on his quest to Maine.

28:30.317 --> 28:32.536
To Jerusalem's Lot.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.234
And soon
others like him arrived.

28:34.364 --> 28:37.280
Come closer, whaler.

28:37.411 --> 28:39.065
[Faith] Those like Jakub,

28:39.195 --> 28:40.196
they brought
their own followers.

28:44.418 --> 28:46.159
[Faith]
They live at night...

28:48.291 --> 28:50.990
...and drink blood to survive.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.427
Hear me, Martin.

28:53.557 --> 28:55.342
Put aside everything
you thought you knew.

28:55.472 --> 28:58.345
Jakub and his kind are undead.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.000
[sighs] I don't...

29:03.045 --> 29:05.091
I don't believe you.

29:05.221 --> 29:07.136
How can you not believe these?

29:09.573 --> 29:11.488
You said that those were
from a childhood pox.

29:11.619 --> 29:12.968
I lied.

29:16.493 --> 29:18.017
I lied.

29:21.324 --> 29:23.239
We humans were food.

29:23.370 --> 29:25.589
Each scar is where
they fed on me,

29:25.720 --> 29:27.461
and I allowed it.

29:27.591 --> 29:31.030
Drained of blood and floating
on the brink of death,

29:31.160 --> 29:34.076
never crossing,
but coming back to heal,

29:34.207 --> 29:36.078
is a pleasure
that I cannot describe--

29:36.209 --> 29:37.297
Stop it! Stop it!

29:45.218 --> 29:46.436
I have the tickets.

29:49.483 --> 29:51.093
We'll leave tomorrow.

29:58.361 --> 29:59.493
Sit.

30:23.125 --> 30:24.605
You are afraid.

30:24.735 --> 30:26.955
I'm no stranger to death.

30:27.086 --> 30:30.437
Is that what you think I am?

30:32.091 --> 30:33.483
Death?

30:33.614 --> 30:35.355
I don't know what you are.

30:35.485 --> 30:39.446
I am many things.

30:39.576 --> 30:41.448
Draugr.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.450
Nosferatu.

30:43.580 --> 30:45.234
Revenant.

30:45.365 --> 30:48.107
Where I come from,
it is Vampire.

30:49.282 --> 30:51.197
The undead.

30:51.327 --> 30:52.328
Yes.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.767
I never
believed you were real,

30:56.898 --> 31:00.075
no more than a mermaid
or a sea serpent.

31:00.206 --> 31:04.297
All sorts of things
live in the shadows.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.697
You fear light?

31:13.828 --> 31:16.831
We prefer dark.

31:16.962 --> 31:21.270
-And the Christian god?
-No need for him.

31:21.401 --> 31:23.185
We have our own gods.

31:25.318 --> 31:27.581
Why am I here, Jakub?

31:27.711 --> 31:30.758
The miner
who founded this town

31:30.889 --> 31:33.674
unearthed a stolen text

31:33.804 --> 31:36.242
that was not meant
for your kind.

31:36.372 --> 31:41.247
Call it our Bible.

31:41.377 --> 31:44.424
De Vermis Mysteriis.

31:44.554 --> 31:46.948
You speak of
my great-grandfather?

31:47.079 --> 31:51.474
James Boone thought he could
harness our book's power.

31:51.605 --> 31:53.737
With arrogance,

31:53.868 --> 31:58.873
he wrote his name
with blood in its pages,

31:59.004 --> 32:05.358
damning himself and
every Boone thereafter.

32:05.488 --> 32:07.360
Blood calls blood.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.928
Indeed.

32:10.058 --> 32:13.583
When my quest for this text
brought me here,

32:13.714 --> 32:18.110
I recognized the madness
in your relations.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.764
Phillip, Stephen,

32:20.895 --> 32:22.592
they had the book.

32:22.723 --> 32:24.638
I want it back.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.335
Well, why don't you
get it from them?

32:26.466 --> 32:28.294
I suspect they prefer
the dark, as you do.

32:28.424 --> 32:30.252
Oh, they do now.

32:30.383 --> 32:33.473
I fed them my blood,

32:33.603 --> 32:37.477
made them one of us
in exchange for the book.

32:37.607 --> 32:39.261
But when they went
to retrieve it,

32:39.392 --> 32:41.568
they could not find it,
claimed it was stolen.

32:41.698 --> 32:46.181
Locating it
proved impossible.

32:46.312 --> 32:49.315
-Why?
-Because they are undead.

32:49.445 --> 32:51.273
No longer human.

32:52.753 --> 32:57.323
Only living Boones
hear its call.

32:57.453 --> 32:58.672
No?

33:00.717 --> 33:02.110
The worms?

33:06.723 --> 33:10.684
All that you believe
is madness,

33:10.814 --> 33:13.992
that is my book calling you.

33:16.559 --> 33:20.650
I would have killed your uncle
and cousin for their failure,

33:20.781 --> 33:24.915
but they pled like dogs,

33:25.046 --> 33:29.311
telling me of another Boone
who shared their curse.

33:29.442 --> 33:32.880
They brought you here
to follow your madness,

33:33.011 --> 33:35.013
to find the book
that we cannot.

33:38.668 --> 33:40.496
And if I return it to you...

33:41.584 --> 33:45.458
You free yourself
and your children,

33:45.588 --> 33:49.592
and your children's
children, et al.

33:52.421 --> 33:54.380
Tell me what I have to do.

33:54.510 --> 33:57.861
Listen to its cry.

33:57.992 --> 34:00.342
Stop fighting.

34:00.473 --> 34:02.301
When the book speaks,

34:02.431 --> 34:06.000
invite it in.

34:06.131 --> 34:11.701
Surrender and
De Vermis Mysteriis

34:11.832 --> 34:16.619
will lead you to it.

34:16.750 --> 34:20.710
Your uncle and cousin will want
the book for themselves.

34:20.841 --> 34:23.844
Deliver it to me

34:23.974 --> 34:26.542
and only me.

34:34.028 --> 34:36.813
I can't help you.

34:36.944 --> 34:39.207
I know where
that madness leads.

34:39.338 --> 34:44.343
I'd rather die here, now,

34:44.473 --> 34:46.084
than to risk
hurting my family.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.885
Help me, Charles Boone!

35:05.015 --> 35:08.715
You know me.
Help me, please!

35:08.845 --> 35:11.326
You harm them and I swear
you'll never see that book.

35:19.465 --> 35:20.857
[Rose]
Please, please don't kill me.

35:25.384 --> 35:27.473
Release them.

35:27.603 --> 35:29.083
I'll do what you want.

35:29.214 --> 35:34.175
Oh, whaler. What mercy
did you show Leviathan?

35:34.306 --> 35:35.394
[Rose] No!

35:39.833 --> 35:41.748
-[Able] No!
-No more!

35:45.055 --> 35:47.275
[Able] Mr. Boone! No!

35:47.406 --> 35:48.668
I'll find your book!

35:48.798 --> 35:51.584
[Able, grunting] No!

35:51.714 --> 35:52.628
No!

35:57.155 --> 36:00.288
-[Able] No! No!
-[Charles] No!

36:06.468 --> 36:09.950
Once you hold that book,

36:10.080 --> 36:13.780
it will sear its way
into your soul,

36:13.910 --> 36:16.826
showing you things...

36:18.915 --> 36:22.005
you will wish
you could forget.

36:22.136 --> 36:25.357
Cling to these words, whaler.

36:27.141 --> 36:31.276
Only I can save you.

36:33.887 --> 36:35.454
Go.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.883
-Where's Loa?
-In the kitchen.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.798
She's not in the kitchen.
I was just there.

37:15.929 --> 37:17.670
We don't want
to be in your story.

37:17.800 --> 37:19.367
What?

37:21.282 --> 37:23.241
-Loa found your writings.
-[sighs]

37:28.985 --> 37:30.770
Do you mean everything
you say about us?

37:30.900 --> 37:33.033
-It's meant to be fiction.
-It doesn't read like fiction.

37:33.163 --> 37:36.602
-And we're not cursed.
-I know.

37:37.690 --> 37:39.822
You're no different
than the people in town.

37:39.953 --> 37:41.824
At least
they say it to our face.

37:41.955 --> 37:43.652
I'm so sorry I hurt you.

37:43.783 --> 37:45.698
That was never my intention.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.440
But, right now,
we need to find Loa.

37:48.570 --> 37:49.745
Come on.

38:47.499 --> 38:48.326
Phillip!

39:06.300 --> 39:09.129
She's mine now.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.081
Mary?

39:52.955 --> 39:54.130
Mary?

41:13.471 --> 41:15.124
My father taught me to play.

41:16.430 --> 41:18.258
And I taught Marcella.

41:20.913 --> 41:23.263
You took her toys out.

41:26.919 --> 41:28.660
I miss my daughter.

41:33.273 --> 41:35.580
Come on!
She's upstairs!

41:36.668 --> 41:39.322
There's no greater sorrow
for a parent

41:39.453 --> 41:41.542
than to lose a child.

41:47.026 --> 41:49.942
Wait! Honor, Honor! Wait.

41:50.072 --> 41:51.117
Loa?

41:54.250 --> 41:55.643
Loa!
