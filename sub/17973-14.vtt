<i>Projects Runway.</i>

00:36.270 --> 00:37.503
All right, designers.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.805
I'm David Hyde Pierce's
father, Tim Gunn.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.841
For today's challenge,
you have $50 to...

00:45.278 --> 00:46.445
Ouchies.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.613
Really, B.E.T.?

00:47.615 --> 00:49.615
Uh-uh! Get your
butt out that chair!

00:49.617 --> 00:50.949
That seat's for my dad.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.618
He asked if he
could come over

00:52.620 --> 00:54.486
and watch <i>March Madness</i>
<i>with me.</i>

00:54.488 --> 00:56.989
You know what
this means, Rallo?
What?

00:56.991 --> 00:58.957
Why are you saying
it like that?

00:58.959 --> 00:59.825
Just tell me.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.093
Well, all right.

01:01.095 --> 01:02.694
We're going to bond

01:02.696 --> 01:04.530
as father and son.

01:04.532 --> 01:06.665
Oh! That's not what
I thought you were gonna say!

01:06.667 --> 01:08.000
That's good!

01:08.002 --> 01:10.335
You've been waiting for that
for a long time.

01:10.337 --> 01:11.336
Man, good luck!

01:11.338 --> 01:14.106
From one neglected son
to another,

01:14.108 --> 01:16.175
go with God.

01:16.177 --> 01:19.344
Hey, y'all hear Cleveland's
bonding with his dad?!

01:19.346 --> 01:22.514
Rallo can be
all right sometimes.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.787
in this tournament,

01:28.789 --> 01:31.356
right next to my dad.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.758
Good game, huh?

01:32.760 --> 01:35.160
Great game.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.529
Hey, check it out, I paid
extra for the package

01:37.531 --> 01:39.498
that just lets you hear
the shoes squeaking.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.999
(shoes squeaking)

01:41.001 --> 01:43.335
How much is the package
that has no you?

01:43.337 --> 01:44.436
Zing!

01:44.438 --> 01:46.371
Ha, ha! This is fun,
I'm having fun,

01:46.373 --> 01:47.673
we're having fun.

01:47.675 --> 01:49.675
Hey, looks like you're
getting low on ice.

01:49.677 --> 01:50.943
(loud mechanical rumbling)

01:50.945 --> 01:53.345
I bought this just for the game!

01:53.347 --> 01:54.680
I thought you'd like it!

01:54.682 --> 01:57.583
Do you like me, it, Dad?! Dad?!

01:57.585 --> 01:58.984
Dad!?

01:58.986 --> 02:01.253
I don't want ice
in my beer, Tubby!

02:01.255 --> 02:03.188
I ain't no white dude

02:03.190 --> 02:05.991
Kansas versus
Wofford College.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.026
Wofford's gonna win.

02:08.028 --> 02:09.495
(laughs)

02:09.497 --> 02:10.963
I doubt that,
Tubby Jr.

02:10.965 --> 02:13.699
A 16 seed's never
beaten a number one.

02:13.701 --> 02:16.502
Guess you taught your
son everything you
know about sports.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.103

02:18.105 --> 02:19.771
ANNOUNCER :
And in a history-making upset,

02:19.773 --> 02:22.307
Wofford obliterates Kansas,

02:22.309 --> 02:24.676
128 to 72!

02:24.678 --> 02:26.979
How the hell did
you know that?
Easy.

02:26.981 --> 02:29.848
I just thought about
which team's mascot
would win in a fight.

02:29.850 --> 02:32.751
Wofford's Terrier against
Kansas's Jayhawk?

02:32.753 --> 02:35.521
That dog would
rip the head off
some stupid bird.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.856
You knew Wofford
College's mascot?

02:37.858 --> 02:39.091
I know all of them!

02:39.093 --> 02:40.759
I've been memorizing
the Internet.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.427
Okay, let's test
out your system.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.496
Michigan versus
U.C. Irvine, who won?

02:44.498 --> 02:46.165
Uh, last time
I checked,

02:46.167 --> 02:48.500
a wolverine was tougher
than an anteater.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.469
Michigan, silly.

02:50.471 --> 02:51.870
Damn! That's two for two.

02:51.872 --> 02:54.473
Come on, Junior, we got
to go talk to my bookie.

02:54.475 --> 02:57.176
Okay, but first
I'll talk to my forkie.

02:57.178 --> 03:00.012
Hey, Forkie. Hey, Junior.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.347
Are you having a nice <i>tine?</i>

03:02.349 --> 03:03.682
(chuckles)
Hey, that's racist!

03:03.684 --> 03:06.018
I know. What you
gonna do about it?

03:06.020 --> 03:08.987
(cries, shouts in pain)
(dish breaks)

03:08.989 --> 03:11.490
But, Dad,
what about our bonding?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.824
Bonding?

03:12.826 --> 03:15.661
Look, man, I came
because you got a big TV,

03:15.663 --> 03:17.596
free food,
and a cushioned toilet seat

03:17.598 --> 03:19.765
that when you
sit on it goes,

03:19.767 --> 03:22.701
"pssssshhh... "

03:28.174 --> 03:30.342
Roberta, I'm baking my
March Madness Hoopsberry pie.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.010
Can you run to the store

03:32.012 --> 03:33.946
and pick me up
some orange frosting?

03:33.948 --> 03:36.448
Just put some food
coloring in the
vanilla, bitch.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.283
Roberta!
Oh, Mama!

03:38.285 --> 03:39.685
I thought you
were Junior.

03:39.687 --> 03:42.955
He asked me for
orange frosting
eight times today.

03:42.957 --> 03:45.023
I'll go get it, Mom.
No problem.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.491
Oh. Well,
thank you, Rallo.

03:46.493 --> 03:48.827
I need it quick,
so don't be a wimp

03:48.829 --> 03:50.495
about cutting through
that dark alley.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.364
All right!

03:56.336 --> 03:59.871
Okay, who do I take,
Notre Dame or Illinois?

03:59.873 --> 04:01.940
Hmm. The Fighting Irish

04:01.942 --> 04:03.942
versus the Fighting Illini...

04:03.944 --> 04:07.346
CLEVELAND JR.:
<i>This is a toughie because</i>
<i>they're both drunk as hell.</i>

04:07.348 --> 04:08.747

04:15.321 --> 04:17.823
(beeping)

04:17.825 --> 04:18.991
(explosion)

04:18.993 --> 04:21.493
Take the Illini.

04:22.762 --> 04:25.631
This is the part
of the job I love.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.666
Congratulations.

04:27.668 --> 04:28.834
All right...

04:28.836 --> 04:30.936
Clemson versus Texas?

04:30.938 --> 04:32.838
Well, Clemson's
got the Tiger

04:32.840 --> 04:34.973
and Texas is
the Longhorn.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.341
Now, assuming, of course,
they're battling

04:36.343 --> 04:37.776
on the spiked Platform of Death

04:37.778 --> 04:40.178
<i>from</i> Flash Gordon.

04:40.180 --> 04:41.680

04:41.682 --> 04:43.081

04:45.151 --> 04:46.151
<i>The Longhorn, notorious</i>

04:46.153 --> 04:47.953
<i>for its poor sense of balance,</i>

04:47.955 --> 04:50.489
<i>would fall off</i>
<i>the platform and die.</i>

04:50.491 --> 04:51.590
<i>That's sad.</i>

04:51.592 --> 04:53.158
I'd give it to Clemson.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.926
And I'd take the points.

04:57.430 --> 05:00.532
I think your new TV's
even bigger than my Dad's!

05:00.534 --> 05:02.701
(chuckles)
Check out the
remote control.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.003
Two, four, seven...

05:05.005 --> 05:06.938
Got 'em all.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.374
Junior, life don't stink.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.714
(laughs)
You funny.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.749
You like a black Mork.

05:17.751 --> 05:18.784
Nanu-nanu!

05:18.786 --> 05:21.286
Look, cocaine!

05:21.288 --> 05:22.688
(snorts)

05:23.790 --> 05:25.757
Rallo, where'd
you get that money?

05:25.759 --> 05:28.593
Every time you refuse
to run an errand for Mama,

05:28.595 --> 05:29.761
she sends me.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.963
And not once has she
asked for the change.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.432
So I've been saving up.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.766
Even started
clipping coupons

05:34.768 --> 05:36.668
to increase
my profit margin.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.003
Yeah, but how
much could you...

05:38.005 --> 05:39.504
2,900 bucks.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.174
Gonna buy me a '67 Mustang.

05:42.176 --> 05:43.642
(laughs) You're five.

05:43.644 --> 05:45.610
You can't buy a car.

05:45.612 --> 05:46.978
Just did.

05:46.980 --> 05:50.582
Now I'm gonna try
to see a naked lady.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.551
Ah, it says you have to be 18.

05:55.988 --> 05:58.323
No... way!

05:58.325 --> 06:00.292
Where did you get him?!

06:00.294 --> 06:02.160
Oh! Is his name Charlie?

06:02.162 --> 06:04.162
Come here, Charlie.
Come here.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.864
No, his name's not Charlie.

06:05.866 --> 06:06.865
What is it?!

06:06.867 --> 06:08.100
Larry the Monkey.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.102
Grandpa Freight Train
bought him for me

06:10.104 --> 06:11.770
with some of his
basketball winnings.

06:11.772 --> 06:13.271
Come on, Larry the Monkey,

06:13.273 --> 06:15.707
let's get to know each other
before you inevitably

06:15.709 --> 06:18.377
rip my face and privates off.

06:19.712 --> 06:20.946
That poor boy.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.482
I've seen this too
many times before.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.317
Good old Freight Train's
your best friend

06:25.319 --> 06:27.319
as long as he needs
you to pick winners

06:27.321 --> 06:28.754
or help him move...

06:28.756 --> 06:31.857
Or pose as his
young wife at his
high school reunion.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.526
I repeatedly asked
you not to do that.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.461
He bought me a piece
of salmon fish!

06:36.463 --> 06:37.996
Wow!

06:37.998 --> 06:39.731
(doorbell rings)

06:40.666 --> 06:42.834
Hey, Donna. I'm here
to pick up Junior.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.670
Over my dead body!

06:45.672 --> 06:48.173
Holy...
Don't worry, it's a stage rig.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.841
Borrowed it from
the community theater.

06:49.843 --> 06:52.310
But my point is,
I am not letting you

06:52.312 --> 06:54.513
gamble with
Junior anymore.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.448
What?! <i>March Madness</i>
<i>ended two weeks ago.</i>

06:56.450 --> 06:58.083
Junior and I aren't
gambling anymore.

06:58.085 --> 07:00.285
Sure, I might've been
using him at first,

07:00.287 --> 07:02.921
but it turns out,
I just like the kid.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.656
Makes me feel young.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.992
One, two...

07:06.994 --> 07:08.493
three.

07:08.495 --> 07:12.130
Soul... plane!

07:16.536 --> 07:18.103

07:19.839 --> 07:21.973
You're not gonna
kiss me, are you?

07:21.975 --> 07:23.942
And the guys
at the office loved him.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.710
They agreed that he...
You took him

07:25.712 --> 07:27.779
to your office? You
work at an office?

07:27.781 --> 07:29.714
You've never taken
me to your office!

07:29.716 --> 07:31.516
I've got the heart
of a 60-year-old,

07:31.518 --> 07:33.518
and now the hobby of one.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.986

golf club cover?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.660

07:41.662 --> 07:43.328
Well, who better
to help you <i>drive</i>

07:43.330 --> 07:45.096

planet Kashyyk?

07:47.468 --> 07:49.868

Taught you well, I
have, Train Freight.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.603
Okay, this is
ridiculous!

07:51.605 --> 07:54.172
I tried to show you
<i>Star Wars</i> in 1978,

07:54.174 --> 07:56.441

07:56.443 --> 07:58.777
(clears throat) "space 'mo."

07:58.779 --> 08:00.679
(chuckles) Yeah.
Well, we golfin'.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.848
Catch you later,
Jabba the Gut.

08:02.850 --> 08:05.517
Oh! But Junior's
tubbier than me!

08:05.519 --> 08:08.119
Calling your
own son fat.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.488

with my father.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.610
Also, pockets in socks.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.845
Sock pockets.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.547
Remember the
sock pockets!

08:35.549 --> 08:37.215
Remember
the sock pockets!

What do you want, Stinky?

(clears throat)

08:40.754 --> 08:42.020
"Father...

"Padre, Papa...

Oh, come on!

09:04.011 --> 09:05.510
Why?! Aah!

09:05.512 --> 09:07.979
Look, we don't get
along, that's all.

09:07.981 --> 09:10.181
But why?!
Give me a reason.

09:10.183 --> 09:11.483
You want to know why?!

09:11.485 --> 09:13.652
'Cause you couldn't find a flag
in a pancake!

09:13.654 --> 09:16.321
What's that now?
The flag in the pancake!

09:16.323 --> 09:18.890
When we went on
<i>Dare Squared,</i> remember?

09:19.625 --> 09:22.227
(theme music playing, cheering)

09:24.263 --> 09:27.332
Okay, it's time
for the obstacle course.

09:27.334 --> 09:29.334
If the red team can
find all the flags

09:29.336 --> 09:30.669
before time runs out,

09:30.671 --> 09:32.871
they're gonna win
a trip to Orlando--

09:32.873 --> 09:34.606
the theme park, boy band

09:34.608 --> 09:37.676
and child molester
capital of the world!

09:37.678 --> 09:39.177
(applause, cheering)

09:39.179 --> 09:42.013
Oh boy, Dad,
here we go!

09:42.015 --> 09:43.682
Let's do this, son!

09:43.684 --> 09:44.749
HOST: On your mark,

09:44.751 --> 09:47.485
get set, go!

09:47.487 --> 09:49.621
HOST: Cookie's got
the first challenge.

09:49.623 --> 09:51.289
It's called Happy Birthday.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.891
Go, go, go!
Yeah, yeah!

09:54.160 --> 09:55.594
(grunting)

10:01.634 --> 10:03.034
Flag number one,

10:03.036 --> 10:05.470
and it's Freight Train's turn
in the Royal Flush.

10:05.472 --> 10:06.905
(cheering)

10:09.508 --> 10:10.775
I'm number one,

10:10.777 --> 10:13.044
but I'm going down
like number two!

10:13.046 --> 10:14.579
(toilet flushes)

10:15.681 --> 10:18.350
(grunts)

10:18.352 --> 10:19.684
HOST: Okay, only one more flag,

10:19.686 --> 10:21.319
and they are going to Orlando.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.322
Cleveland just has to find it
in Flapjack Attack.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.690
20 seconds.

10:25.692 --> 10:27.325
Should be plenty of time.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.027
Can he find it?

10:29.029 --> 10:31.596
I can't...
Where's the...

10:31.598 --> 10:33.365
Flag in the flapjacks.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.333
The    <i>on</i>bright
orange thing in there.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.801
COOKIE: Come on!

10:36.803 --> 10:38.670
Under the butter!
It's under the butter!
Come on!

10:38.672 --> 10:40.305
It is, in fact,
under the butter.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.841
We are <i>all</i> seeing it.

10:42.843 --> 10:45.043
It's right there!

10:46.712 --> 10:48.847
It's right (bleep) there!

10:48.849 --> 10:51.249
(buzzer sounds)

10:51.984 --> 10:54.052
(crying)

10:55.821 --> 10:58.523
<i>DareSquared...</i> of course!

10:58.525 --> 11:00.325
So that's why I can't
eat pancakes

11:00.327 --> 11:01.793
except in the morning

11:01.795 --> 11:03.995
or occasionally
other times of day.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.798
That was when everything
in my life went to crap.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.534
My work buddies at Google--
not the one you're thinking of,

11:09.536 --> 11:12.303
we made eyes for puppets--
they started making fun of me,

11:12.305 --> 11:14.606
so I stopped going to
work, and I got fired.

11:14.608 --> 11:17.542
The next day, I got bit by
a skunk and caught rabus.

11:17.544 --> 11:20.345
And then, unemployed
and foaming at the mouth,

11:20.347 --> 11:23.515
I cheated on your poor,
poor mother for the first time.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.316
Actually, that was
the fifth time.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.452
First time with
a bank teller.
Actually...

11:27.454 --> 11:29.788
First time with a bank
teller named Charmaine.

11:29.790 --> 11:32.490
Remember when I stabbed
that bitch with her own ink pen?

11:32.492 --> 11:33.992
Ripped it right off the chain!

11:33.994 --> 11:37.028
Then, when I finally got
a shot at my dream--

11:37.030 --> 11:40.765
a tryout with the Redskins--
your bad luck followed me.

11:40.767 --> 11:43.435
I got cut two weeks
into training camp.

11:43.437 --> 11:45.437
Lost my spot to
Cannonball Williams.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.872
Hall of Famer turned rotisserie
chicken franchise mogul

11:47.874 --> 11:49.641
Cannonball "Mm Mm" Williams?!

11:49.643 --> 11:51.876
That should've been me
playing in those games.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.144
That should've been me

11:53.146 --> 11:55.480
mailing drawings of my
penis to cheerleaders.

11:55.482 --> 11:58.783
That should've been me posing
awkwardly on football cards.

11:58.785 --> 12:01.453
But because of you, I
got to stand like this.

12:01.455 --> 12:06.257
Father, isn't it possible that
you're blaming me for all...

12:06.259 --> 12:07.492
Shut your mouth!

12:07.494 --> 12:09.661
I have nothing
to say to you.

12:09.663 --> 12:15.333
It was under
the damn butter.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.735
(revving)

12:20.840 --> 12:22.173
You did it, Rallo.

12:22.175 --> 12:23.875
A '67 Mustang.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.009
Yep.

12:25.011 --> 12:27.278
Been wanting one of these
my whole life.

12:27.280 --> 12:29.848
And this feels like
an intersection.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.916
(tires screeching)

12:34.453 --> 12:36.688
Rallo, all this bouncing around
is have to make me

12:36.690 --> 12:38.156
want to go use the restroom.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.758
Well, that's your problem.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.860
I told you to go
before we left the house.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.329
If you don't pull over, it's
gonna be all our problem.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.064
All right, fine.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.501
You know how to
parallel park?

12:49.503 --> 12:52.670
Sure, I've seen my mom do it
plenty of times.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.673
(slamming, glass breaking)

12:58.644 --> 13:00.078
Just like Mama.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.215
"Hoarding," my ass.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.750
Like I'm gonna
throw out magazines

13:05.752 --> 13:07.085
with movie stars in them.

13:07.087 --> 13:08.186
Cleveland!

13:08.188 --> 13:09.854
You got camel nose
in that thing.

13:09.856 --> 13:10.922
What you doing?

13:10.924 --> 13:13.925
Searching for a flag
for my father.

13:13.927 --> 13:17.162
Much like the soldiers
at "I-wo Jy-ma."

13:17.164 --> 13:20.098
Cleveland, what have I told you
about referencing World War Two?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.699
It bums me out.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.302
You tried to talk to your dad,
and it didn't work.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.104
It's time for you to move on.

13:26.106 --> 13:30.008
As my Cousin Ernestine always
said, "Two people in a boat?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.609
I don't think so."

13:31.611 --> 13:33.111
Thank you, Donna.

13:33.113 --> 13:34.979
I needed to
hear that.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.281
Daddy, Daddy!

13:36.283 --> 13:38.650
Guess who Grandpa Freight Train
asked to be his partner

13:38.652 --> 13:40.418
in a golf tournament
this weekend!

13:40.420 --> 13:41.653
Me?! Hooray!

13:41.655 --> 13:43.421
Daddy forgives me!

13:43.423 --> 13:44.422
(laughs)

13:44.424 --> 13:46.090
No, silly, me.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.959
And I'm getting
pretty good at golf.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.994
I might get to win
a trophy!

13:49.996 --> 13:52.931
An actual sports trophy,
with a guy on it.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.533
Not a book
or an owl or pasta.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.103
I like your Mr.
Macaroni trophy.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.673
'Member? You ate
that whole pan.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.441
Scrapings and all.

14:03.443 --> 14:06.778
Yeah, but this time I'm gonna
know I'm in a contest.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.112
(laughs)

14:08.114 --> 14:09.347
(tires screech, horn honks)

14:09.349 --> 14:10.648
(screams)

14:10.650 --> 14:12.150
Are we there yet, Rallo?
We there?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.151
Are we there yet?

14:13.153 --> 14:14.152
We there?

14:14.154 --> 14:15.420
Huh, you know what?

14:15.422 --> 14:18.323
On this side, that <i>is</i> annoying.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.457
We lost.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.492
(engine idling)

14:22.494 --> 14:24.863
Just filled up
on number three.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.999
Took me a minute to get
the hang of the pump.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.033
(spits twice)

14:29.035 --> 14:30.768
Hey, I was wondering

14:30.770 --> 14:33.371
if you could give me
directions to here?

14:34.206 --> 14:36.007
It's my house.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.510
This is it, as you can see,
on a very sunny day.

14:39.512 --> 14:42.146
Son, you seem lost
and you reek of gas.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.849
I have reason to suspect
you're with Randy Quaid.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.684
I'm calling the cops.
(dialing)

14:46.686 --> 14:48.319
Five-O creepin'!

14:48.321 --> 14:50.822
We got to go!
My tags ain't right!

14:50.824 --> 14:52.724
(tires screech)

14:55.961 --> 14:58.596
Hey, follow the grooves, woman.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.632
And careful with
the speed bumps in the back.

15:00.634 --> 15:03.468
You gonna tell Montel's former
hairdresser how to shave a head?

15:03.470 --> 15:04.469
Ow!

15:04.471 --> 15:05.670
The hell?

15:06.538 --> 15:07.972
Fore!

15:07.974 --> 15:10.008
Cleveland, what do you
think you're doing?

15:10.010 --> 15:12.977
Just practicing my golf
for the big tournament.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.445
You're playing in
the tournament?

15:14.447 --> 15:16.447
What dumbass agreed
to be your partner?

15:16.449 --> 15:17.749
This dumbass.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.488
Cannonball Williams?

15:23.490 --> 15:26.691
Hey, looks like Freight Train
added a snack car!

15:26.693 --> 15:27.859
(laughs)

15:27.861 --> 15:29.827
Yeah, and check
out his caboose!

15:29.829 --> 15:31.429
(laughs)

15:31.431 --> 15:33.765
What a fat,
jiggly ass!

15:33.767 --> 15:35.566
Okay, this is
getting weird.

15:39.538 --> 15:41.839
Cannonball Williams,
you no-neck,

15:41.841 --> 15:43.174
rat-soup-eating bastard!

15:43.176 --> 15:45.510
I swore if I ever
saw you again, I'd...

15:45.512 --> 15:46.678
You'd do what?

15:46.680 --> 15:48.012
You ain't no Freight Train.

15:48.014 --> 15:49.180
You're a fart stain.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.515
(laughs): Ho-ho!

15:50.517 --> 15:52.817
You all know I'm not a fan
of potty humor,

15:52.819 --> 15:54.652
but when it's done
intelligently like that...

15:54.654 --> 15:55.687
(kisses)

15:55.689 --> 15:58.790
Oh, Cannonball,
my new father figure,

15:58.792 --> 16:01.592
tell me how the world works,
bounce me on your knee.

16:01.594 --> 16:03.928
Bounce me on your knee!

16:07.299 --> 16:09.000
Oh, yeah!

16:09.002 --> 16:10.168
That's it!

16:10.170 --> 16:11.703
Bounce me, Daddy!

16:11.705 --> 16:15.540
Oh, gee, Freight Train,
I forgot you existed.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.475
Is this hard for you?

16:17.477 --> 16:21.179
Does it make you jealous,
seeing me with my new daddy?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.481
Your son is a mess,
Freight Train.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.016
Ha! You hear that?

16:25.018 --> 16:26.317
I'm a mess.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.852
Thanks to you.

16:29.088 --> 16:31.990
(car horns honking,
tires screeching)

16:31.992 --> 16:33.691
Look, I don't mean to be
the little bitch,

16:33.693 --> 16:34.926
but this ain't,
this ain't safe.

16:34.928 --> 16:35.927
What?

16:35.929 --> 16:37.462
Don't make me come back there!

16:37.464 --> 16:38.463
You know what?

16:38.465 --> 16:40.531
(punches landing)

16:42.034 --> 16:45.169
ANGUS: Welcome to the Stoolbend
Two-Man Golf Classic.

16:45.171 --> 16:48.172
GORDY: Breaking records
with four black people

16:48.174 --> 16:50.308
playing golf on the same day.

16:50.310 --> 16:54.012
And I've accidentally
called each one Vijay Singh.

16:54.014 --> 16:56.347
Junior, can I be
honest with you?

16:56.349 --> 16:59.317
A long time ago, that Cannonball
got inside my head.

16:59.319 --> 17:00.651
I'm scared, man.

17:00.653 --> 17:04.255
Grandpa, can I be
honest with you, too?

17:04.257 --> 17:06.858
You're talking like a
little piss-pants right now!

17:06.860 --> 17:08.926
Now, I am taking
that trophy home,

17:08.928 --> 17:11.996
and I best not have to
piggyback your ass to do it!

17:11.998 --> 17:14.432
This is why I like you
more than your father.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.377
Hold still; I'm
almost done.

17:26.379 --> 17:29.080
We may forget our ears,
but the sun doesn't.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.384
Yes!

17:35.754 --> 17:37.922
You're up.

17:45.531 --> 17:47.432
Yay! I'm Tiger Woods!

17:47.434 --> 17:48.833
I'm Tiger Woods!

17:48.835 --> 17:50.802
(panting)

17:50.804 --> 17:54.705
Must've put on a few pounds
since my Quahog days.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.741
Whew. I'm sure no one noticed.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.212
Yes!

18:01.214 --> 18:02.346
Right in the cup.

18:02.348 --> 18:03.681
Boop.
(grunts)

18:03.683 --> 18:05.516
You're not supposed
to boop a man's balls

18:05.518 --> 18:07.251
till the third hole.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.821
♪

18:26.271 --> 18:27.772
Focus!

18:27.774 --> 18:30.775
Keep your eye on the ball!
Keep your eye on the ball!

18:30.777 --> 18:32.443
My favorite nipple!

18:32.445 --> 18:35.813
On the 18th hole,
with only two teams remaining,

18:35.815 --> 18:40.518
it all comes down to Cleveland
Brown and Cleveland Brown, Jr.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.020
ANGUS:
Cleveland stuck behind a tree.

18:43.022 --> 18:45.123
Perfect placement
for taking a whizz,

18:45.125 --> 18:46.791
not so much for playing golf.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.593
(people screaming)

18:50.195 --> 18:51.829
Man, we must be
going in circles.

18:51.831 --> 18:53.898
Didn't we just hear
a bunch of people scream?

18:57.302 --> 18:59.137
Hey, Cleveland, I hope you find

18:59.139 --> 19:01.105
a measure of peace
with your daaaaad!

19:02.141 --> 19:04.742
Well, that makes things easier.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.380
Yeah!

19:09.382 --> 19:11.949
Par-three over here!

19:15.287 --> 19:18.022
ANGUS: Like a quadriplegic
pageant winner,

19:18.024 --> 19:19.790
Cleveland is sitting pretty.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.994
GORDY: All he has to do now
is tap it in

19:22.996 --> 19:25.129
to take home
this actual sports trophy.

19:25.131 --> 19:26.464
The trophy.

19:26.466 --> 19:28.633
CLEVELAND JR.:
<i>I might get to win a trophy.</i>

19:28.635 --> 19:30.168
<i>An actual sports troph...</i>

19:30.170 --> 19:31.536
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah,
I know.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.438
I just want to beat my dad
so badly.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.174
CLEVELAND JR.:
<i>At what cost, Daddy?</i>

19:36.176 --> 19:38.176
<i>At what cost?</i>

19:38.178 --> 19:39.544
<i>Good luck with that putt.</i>

19:39.546 --> 19:42.313
<i>I'm gonna go back</i>
<i>in my own body now.</i>

19:42.315 --> 19:45.416
(gasps)

19:50.822 --> 19:52.256
(sighs)

19:52.258 --> 19:54.125
Oh, no, I'm choking!

19:54.127 --> 19:56.627
It's Dare Squared
all over again!

19:56.629 --> 19:58.296
(people gasp)

19:58.298 --> 20:00.031
Dang!

20:00.033 --> 20:03.901
ANGUS:
Freight Train and Cleveland
Brown Jr. win the tournament!

20:05.837 --> 20:06.837
We did it!

20:06.839 --> 20:08.506
We won the
sports trophy!

20:08.508 --> 20:09.840
Yeah!
(back cracks)

20:09.842 --> 20:11.409
Oh, nope. Bad idea.

20:12.377 --> 20:14.612
Wait a minute.

20:14.614 --> 20:17.014
You threw the match on
purpose, didn't you?

20:17.016 --> 20:18.182
Duh.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.617
I did it really obviously

20:19.619 --> 20:22.019
so you would know
the sacrifice I was making.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.822
That's why you're better
than Grandpa Freight Train.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.157
I am?

20:26.159 --> 20:29.594
He's a good grandfather,
but he was a terrible dad.

20:29.596 --> 20:33.931
You're a great dad, and you'll
be an awesome grandfather.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.833
Aw, thanks, Junior.

20:35.835 --> 20:39.003
I promise I will never
show your son love,

20:39.005 --> 20:40.938
because it might
hurt your feelings.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.974
Thanks, Daddy.

20:42.976 --> 20:44.675
Hey, everybody!

20:44.677 --> 20:46.844
We're all gonna get laid!

20:46.846 --> 20:48.546

20:49.481 --> 20:51.549
