[BO narrating]
Previously, on Lost Girl:

00:07.592 --> 00:09.548
[BO] I have no sex drive.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.591
[LAUREN] Any connection
between her and the other two?

00:12.597 --> 00:14.588
Train me. Like you did Kenzi.

00:14.807 --> 00:16.968
Okay. Maybe we can start
with something a little simpler.

00:17.185 --> 00:17.970
[TAMSIN] Wanna pack it in?

00:18.186 --> 00:18.925
Let me help you out.

00:19.145 --> 00:20.225
[LAUREN] Tamsin, stop it.
You're gonna kill her.

00:20.438 --> 00:21.803
[TAMSIN] It's what she wants!

00:22.023 --> 00:23.638
[BO] I lose everyone.

00:23.858 --> 00:27.897
It's only a matter of time
before I lose all of you.

00:28.112 --> 00:30.068
Wherever you go, | go.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.646
Not going anywhere.

00:31.866 --> 00:34.528
You will never be alone.

00:36.662 --> 00:40.530
[TAMSIN giggling]
[pop rock music plays]

00:40.750 --> 00:45.494
[TAMSIN] Ah! Yes! Frank,
that was a solid B plus.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.249
|t's--|t's Tad.

00:47.465 --> 00:49.080
You're hilarious.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.461
Ugh, l'm starving.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.963
Y'know I could really
use some Chinese food.

00:56.057 --> 00:57.467
I love my roommate.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.344
That's okay, Tamsin.
No need to grab our weapons

00:59.560 --> 01:00.845
[B0] and come
right back to the pub.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.472
I can take down the
bitey little Clurichaun

01:02.688 --> 01:04.303
all by myself, really.

01:04.523 --> 01:07.139
Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry about that.

01:07.360 --> 01:09.191
Y'know, l was totally
on my way back

01:09.403 --> 01:11.610
when | just
happened to bang into--

01:11.822 --> 01:13.687
Well | banged this guy.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.318
Tad.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.195
Shhh.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.526
In my bed.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.657
Yeah that's weird, right?

01:20.873 --> 01:22.158
But this smells good.

01:22.375 --> 01:22.909
Ahh-ahh-ahhh!

01:23.125 --> 01:23.989
You're not gonna share?

01:24.210 --> 01:26.166
Well, that depends.

01:26.379 --> 01:29.462
Are you gonna share?

01:29.674 --> 01:32.165
[TAMSIN] Oh Frank!
It is your lucky night,

01:32.385 --> 01:34.091
because my succubus
friend just got her mojo back

01:34.303 --> 01:36.214
and she's hornier than
a monkey with eight dicks.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.170
Or something feminine and sexy.

01:38.391 --> 01:39.676
Mmm. Whatever.

01:39.892 --> 01:42.383
Buckle up, studmuffin.
Thank you.

01:43.187 --> 01:49.524
[pop rock music plays]

01:50.069 --> 01:55.280
[MAN breathing heavily]

01:55.491 --> 01:59.700
Two twenty-five.

01:59.912 --> 02:04.121
Um... This should cover it.

02:05.418 --> 02:06.908
Exact change.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.743
Come on, man. I'm cold.

02:08.963 --> 02:11.295
Come on, kid.
I'm not a pawn shop.

02:13.384 --> 02:15.124
|t's--|t's my
grandfather's watch.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.006
All right, I'm desperate.
Have a heart, please.

02:21.809 --> 02:22.764
When are we leaving?

02:22.977 --> 02:25.684
Ah, when I'm
good and ready. Yeah.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.744
You know, there are a lot
of seats that aren't taken.

02:43.956 --> 02:47.494
Yeah. Yeah, there are.

02:49.086 --> 02:53.079
Guess I was just taken by you.

02:53.299 --> 02:54.835
[titte rs]

02:56.135 --> 02:57.090
Mark.

02:57.303 --> 02:58.292
Margaret.

02:58.512 --> 03:01.675
Maggy. | go by Maggy now.
Maggy Dermay.

03:01.891 --> 03:05.884
Let me guess.
You're from a small town

03:06.103 --> 03:10.346
and you have a big family,
a very strict family.

03:12.818 --> 03:14.069
Just didn't approve
of your being pregnant,

03:14.278 --> 03:17.736
so you're fleeing to the city
to raise the baby on your own.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.904
I've done no such thing.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.199
Maggy, l was just joking.

03:23.287 --> 03:24.151
[MARK] Just a joke.

03:24.372 --> 03:25.361
[chuckles]

03:25.581 --> 03:28.323
You're a... singer, right?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.657
How'd you know?

03:29.877 --> 03:33.836
Maggy Dermay. That name can
only belong to a famous singer.

03:34.048 --> 03:35.629
Everyone always
said I was really good;

03:35.841 --> 03:36.921
ever since I was little.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.592
So, my uncle, Leo,
he got me a pitch pipe for

03:40.805 --> 03:44.172
my fifth birthday and
I've been singing ever since.

03:44.392 --> 03:47.384
Do you still have it?
The pitch pipe.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.141
[MARK] Wow.

03:54.151 --> 03:56.403
I've got it.

03:56.612 --> 04:06.578
[intense music plays]

04:06.789 --> 04:11.783
[opening theme]

04:14.755 --> 04:15.585
[sighs]

04:15.798 --> 04:18.835
So the husband says to
the wife, "I want sixty-nine."

04:19.051 --> 04:20.291
To which the wife replies,

04:20.511 --> 04:21.591
"If you think I'm
gettin' out of the bed

04:21.804 --> 04:24.216
to make you lemon
chicken, you crazy."

04:24.432 --> 04:26.093
[laughs]

04:26.308 --> 04:29.721
Uh, it gets me every time. Ugh!

04:34.942 --> 04:38.901
[panting]

04:39.113 --> 04:41.650
Bo, did you order delivery?

04:44.368 --> 04:45.778
Hey.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.485
Hey.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.037
Sorry about bursting in.

04:51.250 --> 04:52.706
I wasn't sure if
I had the right place.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.783
[MARK] Doesn't exactly
look like a P.|. firm.

04:55.004 --> 04:58.496
[BO] Yeah,
that is how we like it.

04:59.884 --> 05:01.169
Now you wanna tell us
what you're running from?

05:01.385 --> 05:03.250
I'm not running.
I'm being followed I think.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.051
By who?

05:04.263 --> 05:04.718
[MARK] I don't know.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.136
--[TAMS|N] What did you do?
--[MARK] Nothing.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.337
You don't get followed
for doing nothing.

05:07.558 --> 05:08.798
[MARK] I didn't
do anything, I swear.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.350
Look, |--| can pay.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.928
It's not much but,
it's my grandfather's.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.979
It's gotta be worth
somethin', right?

05:16.192 --> 05:17.147
Sorry, we only take Visa.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.351
Tamsin. Please
excuse my roommate.

05:20.571 --> 05:21.902
She banged into
some low hanging fruit

05:22.114 --> 05:23.524
and now she sucks.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.777
You can keep your watch.

05:25.993 --> 05:27.403
[BO] Where's the
rest of your clothes?

05:27.620 --> 05:30.111
You're lookin' at it. I don't
really have an address.

05:30.331 --> 05:31.787
Okay...

05:33.250 --> 05:37.619
Well, I have a rack of
mens clothes in my room.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.626
Don't ask why. Just uh,
go take your pick, okay?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.673
It's the first
door on your left.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.931
[TAMSIN] Bo, I don't trust him
as far as I want to throw him.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.631
He's trouble. Big trouble.

05:50.851 --> 05:53.809
[TAMSIN] Trust me.
I can feel it in my bones.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.386
He's not worth the agro.

05:55.606 --> 05:59.019
[BO] Tamsin. He's in trouble.
There's a difference.

05:59.235 --> 06:00.771
Yeah, and what was
chasing him could be

06:00.986 --> 06:01.975
right outside
our doorstep waiting.

06:02.196 --> 06:03.686
Exactly, which is why
I wanna know what it is.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.237
I'll tell you what it is;
not our problem.

06:05.449 --> 06:06.814
[BO] Maybe we should
make it our problem.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.535
Ugh. How did I know you
were going to say that?

06:08.744 --> 06:10.860
Okay, look.

06:11.080 --> 06:12.320
If we're gonna be partners,

06:12.540 --> 06:14.496
we need to get a
couple things straight.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.664
One: When you say you're
gonna be back with weapons,

06:16.877 --> 06:18.333
ya come back with weapons.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.537
[BO] Two: We are never
gonna make it unless we find

06:20.756 --> 06:22.496
a more positive way
to speak to each other.

06:22.716 --> 06:25.924
And three: we help those
who need help, so deal with it.

06:26.136 --> 06:28.263
Yeah that sounds way
less confrontational.

06:28.472 --> 06:31.259
[BO] I'm sorry, 'kay.
It's just...

06:31.475 --> 06:32.385
something about this guy.

06:32.601 --> 06:33.260
He's broke?

06:33.477 --> 06:36.765
No. Something... familiar.

06:36.981 --> 06:37.640
He's broke?

06:37.856 --> 06:39.812
[BO] Look, I can't explain it.

06:40.025 --> 06:42.107
And it wouldn't be the
first time I've worked for free.

06:42.319 --> 06:44.059
[TAMSIN] Bo, he's not Kenzi.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.818
We can't keep taking every stray
that comes to our doorstep.

06:48.659 --> 06:51.446
[MARK] I found a shirt.

06:51.662 --> 06:53.323
[BO] Wow. Good choice.

06:53.539 --> 06:54.995
Um, a-are you still hungry?

06:55.207 --> 06:56.708
Nah, you know what?
On second thought, I'm--

06:56.917 --> 06:58.453
I'm just gonna go.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.004
[BO] Hey, Mark, wait.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.044
It's probably all in
my head anyways, right?

07:03.257 --> 07:06.090
I spent a lot of
time running. A lot.

07:06.302 --> 07:07.587
[BO] And one
thing I can tell you

07:07.803 --> 07:09.885
is you can never
run far enough.

07:10.097 --> 07:14.636
Whatever is chacing you will not
stop until you face it head on.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.142
See ya 'round.

07:18.689 --> 07:19.599
[door opens]

07:19.815 --> 07:20.770
[TAMSIN]
Well he left in a hurry.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.223
[door shuts]

07:22.443 --> 07:24.229
Wouldn't you?

07:25.362 --> 07:27.478
[TAMSIN] Oh, Bo!

07:35.247 --> 07:36.703
Uh, that little shit.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.531
Yeah. Now we do it my way.

07:43.589 --> 07:46.296
[LAUREN] These grounds
are quite impressive.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.879
If you don't mind
me saying Mr. Bates,

07:50.095 --> 07:52.802
the leg is looking much better.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.006
[exhales heavily]

08:04.068 --> 08:05.933
Well, at least
she's keeping a low profile

08:06.153 --> 08:08.360
now that she's human.

08:16.580 --> 08:20.744
Make sure Bruce is fed
and milked, straight away.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.334
Images of Catherine
the Great dance in my head.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.343
Toodaloo, govna!

08:35.599 --> 08:37.681
Only I find me funny.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.266
[EVONY] And then I said,
"It doesn't matter that

08:43.482 --> 08:46.098
you didn't steal
the earrings, Rosa.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.695
I already told
everyone that you did."

08:48.904 --> 08:49.654
How'd it look if I suddenly

08:49.863 --> 08:52.400
started changing my tune?

08:52.616 --> 08:54.607
[LAUREN] But you did
the right thing, right?

08:54.827 --> 08:57.910
Of course. I fired
her entire family.

08:59.790 --> 09:00.870
Excellent.

09:01.083 --> 09:03.995
So. Your assisstant
was murdered. Dish.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.917
I don't really know
what to tell you, Evony.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.416
Lisa was a nice girl.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.247
I left her alone.
I feel responsible.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.048
Yeah, yeah. None
of the equipment that

09:12.261 --> 09:14.172
I paid for was damaged, I hope.

09:14.388 --> 09:20.349
No, no. Just...
one precious human life.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.676
[EVONY] That's good.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.227
And the three dead bodies
that just disappeared--

09:24.440 --> 09:25.896
were you gonna mention that?

09:26.108 --> 09:28.064
You have eyes and ears
everywhere don't you?

09:28.277 --> 09:30.438
Lauren, I did not get
shacked up with a fat,

09:30.654 --> 09:34.067
old money buffoon with
fake teeth and horrific gout

09:34.283 --> 09:36.148
to watch the clinic
that I opened in my name

09:36.368 --> 09:38.745
get plundered by common thieves.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.946
No, I did it because
I am a survivor.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.832
And I will not be
made to look like a fool.

09:50.174 --> 09:52.460
The security system that you're
signing for should help insure

09:52.676 --> 09:54.883
that this kinda thing doesn't
happen again in the future.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.960
[EVONY]
And what about my serum?

09:57.181 --> 10:00.298
Coming along?
Progress and all of that.

10:00.517 --> 10:04.476
Oh, you know.
Can't rush science.

10:08.734 --> 10:10.144
[MARK grunts]

10:12.696 --> 10:15.028
Think you can
run from a Valkyrie?

10:15.240 --> 10:16.946
Call me old fashioned,

10:17.159 --> 10:19.195
but I really don't
like being stolen from.

10:19.411 --> 10:21.276
[TAMSIN] Do you know
what we do to theives?

10:21.497 --> 10:23.579
Do you wanna take
it down a notch?

10:24.374 --> 10:25.580
Can I talk to you?

10:25.793 --> 10:26.282
Now?

10:26.502 --> 10:27.992
Yeah. Like we agreed.

10:28.212 --> 10:30.703
[h uffs] Okay.

10:30.923 --> 10:32.288
Go ahead.

10:32.508 --> 10:34.419
[clears throat]

10:34.635 --> 10:36.171
I feel very
disrespected when

10:36.386 --> 10:39.719
you backseat drive
on my bad cop routine.

10:39.932 --> 10:44.301
Okay. Well, I hear you.
But sometimes I wish

10:44.520 --> 10:45.635
you would try a
different approach.

10:45.854 --> 10:48.846
Maybe something
a little sunnier.

10:49.066 --> 10:51.557
Well, I hear you.

10:51.777 --> 10:53.984
But I have been doing
this a very long time

10:54.196 --> 10:57.484
and I would really appreciate
and value your patience.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.315
Well, I give you my patience.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.151
[BOTH]
Don't even think about it.

11:02.371 --> 11:05.488
Look, what happened to
that really weird conversation,

11:05.707 --> 11:07.743
you both seem
like really cool chicks.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.791
Then why did you steal from us?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.210
I need to get outta town. Fast.

11:12.422 --> 11:14.378
This belongs to my best friend.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.547
I'm sorry. Honest.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.671
Honest?

11:18.887 --> 11:20.843
Just how many grandfathers
did you have? Huh?

11:21.056 --> 11:23.172
Alright. I'm really sorry.
You guys are so nice to me.

11:23.392 --> 11:24.598
And nobody ever is, believe me.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.050
I wonder why.

11:26.270 --> 11:28.306
[MARK] Look, I'm not a bad guy.

11:31.608 --> 11:32.814
Oh no.

11:33.026 --> 11:33.856

11:34.069 --> 11:34.854

No. No, no, no, no--

Ah!

12:13.609 --> 12:15.224
I don't have any money.

12:17.529 --> 12:18.769
And I don't want any trouble.

Why don't you just let us
inside and open up the register?

12:22.367 --> 12:24.824
No trouble, just cash.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.331
And if I refuse?

12:28.540 --> 12:30.496

believe you did that.

It was for your own good.

what I got from E-dog--

Oh my god, so much

[TRICK] We need to talk.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.022
[TRICK] Dyson, don't.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.652
Give me one good
reason why I shouldn't.

13:46.868 --> 13:50.031
[TRICK] Just now, behind
The Dal, Vex saved my life.

13:50.247 --> 13:50.997
[scoffs]

13:51.206 --> 13:52.195
Okay, well, he came to my aid.

13:52.416 --> 13:53.872
Two thugs were about
to attack when Vex--

13:54.084 --> 13:56.245
Lemme guess. He took
them out to make it

13:56.461 --> 13:58.622
look like he's changed, again!

13:58.839 --> 14:00.704
Oh, come on.
That's a bit cynical.

14:01.633 --> 14:04.249
Don't worry. That thought's
crossed my mind.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.176
[TRICK] But I figured the safest
place for Vex is with you.

14:07.389 --> 14:11.678
The one man who will
kill him if he's lying.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.230
Better to have a
mesmer and not need one.

14:18.442 --> 14:20.273
And you just might.

14:20.485 --> 14:21.474

Well... at least we have
that in common, eh?

14:53.143 --> 14:55.759
Amazing. I just
took the equivalent of

14:55.979 --> 14:58.015

out of your shoulder.

[LAUREN] It's a metal
derived from a parasite.

15:01.735 --> 15:03.851
What's so cool about this

it's a mineral and it's also alive.

I'm lucky you came by.

you've always benefitted
from human touch.

used these bugs to find us,

16:11.680 --> 16:13.511
maybe we can turn the
tables and do the same.

16:13.723 --> 16:14.883
But we need to find Mark.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.180
Where would a young,
handsome Fae go

16:16.393 --> 16:18.224
in a town he doesn't know?

16:20.605 --> 16:23.221
So it's like I said, all right?
Totally risk free.

16:23.441 --> 16:24.601
All I need from you is
enough money to get

16:24.818 --> 16:27.605

my inheritance, and then...

16:27.821 --> 16:29.527

kill me since I was a boy,

17:09.696 --> 17:11.527
but I don't know why.

Some Fae have natural predators.

Kinda hopin' you could tell me.

wrong with me.

I go I leave a body count?

to catch this bus

from the hunter.

get back, I will kill you.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.755
[DYSON inhales deeply]

23:12.976 --> 23:13.761
What is that?

23:13.977 --> 23:14.682
What is what?

23:14.894 --> 23:17.727
That smell.

23:17.939 --> 23:21.022
[sniffs]

23:21.234 --> 23:23.896
Somethin'...

23:24.112 --> 23:26.319
Somethin' bad.

23:26.531 --> 23:27.771
Well... [chuckles]

23:27.991 --> 23:31.358
we're in a hospital, Dyson.
Everything smells a little bad.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.864
[sniffs]

23:34.080 --> 23:38.164
[LAUREN] So, uh,
whaddya got, detective?

23:38.376 --> 23:42.039
Why these men?
Why these three specifically?

23:42.255 --> 23:45.338
Shop at the same super market?
Carpool friends perhaps?

23:45.550 --> 23:47.211
I thought I made
myself clear, Vex.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.918
Just listen to me.
I tried to get Massimo to

23:50.138 --> 23:51.423
leave town, all right? I tried--

23:51.639 --> 23:52.139
[VEX groans]

23:52.348 --> 23:53.178
Dyson!

23:53.391 --> 23:54.927
[VEX] Augh! But he
wouldn't listen to me!

23:55.143 --> 23:56.633
You seem to have
the same problem.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.889
He was my friend too.

23:59.105 --> 24:04.065
[DYSON] Say his name again!

24:04.277 --> 24:06.518
Say his name, one more time!

24:06.738 --> 24:07.727
He's telling the truth, Dyson.

24:07.947 --> 24:09.403
I was with
Massimo at the end.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.777
[LAUREN] He was
completely beyond reason.

24:11.993 --> 24:14.234
Listen, I'm sorry.
I screwed up, alright!

24:14.454 --> 24:18.823
You are always sorry.
You always screw up.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.283
Do you think it's
easy being a good guy?

24:21.502 --> 24:23.413
Always doing the right thing.

24:23.630 --> 24:27.748
[DYSON] Do you know how easy it
would be to do the wrong thing?

24:27.967 --> 24:30.754
How good that would feel.

24:30.970 --> 24:36.465
Just do it. Come on!
Pull the trigger!

24:36.684 --> 24:38.970
Put me out of my bloody misery.

24:42.398 --> 24:45.231
[LAUREN] Dyson, I know
that you're in a lot of pain,

24:45.443 --> 24:49.152
but Hale and Kenzi
were not his fault.

24:49.364 --> 24:52.401
Dyson, it wasn't
anybody's fault.

24:52.617 --> 24:55.154
This isn't gonna fix anything.

--[VEX sighS]
--[DYSON exhales heavily]

25:11.803 --> 25:13.759
[MARK]
W-What happened?

25:13.971 --> 25:16.257
Oh, you know. You tried
to kill the hunter.

25:16.474 --> 25:18.385
My ex shot you with
a tranquilizer dart.

25:18.601 --> 25:20.717
Usual Thursday fare.

25:20.937 --> 25:21.847
I can explain.

25:22.063 --> 25:25.021
I hope so, Mark. Because
that hunter had some

25:25.233 --> 25:28.396
pretty crazy things
to say about you.

25:28.611 --> 25:29.851
Of course he did.
He's been trying to kill me

25:30.071 --> 25:30.856
since I was a boy.

25:31.072 --> 25:33.859
[BO] He said you killed
his wife and child.

25:34.075 --> 25:34.734
No I didn't.

25:34.951 --> 25:36.316
[BO] Well, he wasn't lying.

25:36.536 --> 25:37.776
Well, what about his ear?

25:37.995 --> 25:40.987
I suppose that just
came off on its own?

25:41.207 --> 25:43.198
No, |--

25:43.418 --> 25:45.625
Yeah, |--| bit his ear off.

25:45.837 --> 25:46.496
Mark.

25:46.713 --> 25:50.297
He murdered my mother.
What would you have done?

25:53.302 --> 25:57.011
H was six years old.
I could've done more.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.339
She hid me under the bed.

26:01.352 --> 26:04.469
And I just watched.

26:04.689 --> 26:06.805
ljust watched him kill her.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.604
I swear, if you you are lying"

26:11.821 --> 26:15.279
[MARK] You think I would
lie about being a coward?

26:15.491 --> 26:19.075
l-l just laid there. I froze.

26:23.374 --> 26:26.707
And after he turned his back...

26:26.919 --> 26:28.955
once he was finished...

26:29.172 --> 26:33.006
Ijumped on him, I bit
his ear off, and I ran.

26:33.217 --> 26:36.630
I ran just like I did
today when you got hurt.

26:36.846 --> 26:39.007
[MARK] I didn't want
him to kill you too.

26:41.934 --> 26:48.180
I tried... I tried
to keep you guys safe.

26:48.399 --> 26:53.814
You are not a coward.

26:54.030 --> 26:56.112
You're just lost.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.529
I'm sick and tired of running.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.450
Of everyone around me dying.

27:04.665 --> 27:10.831
[BO] Trust me. Killing
that man is not the answer.

27:15.218 --> 27:17.174
Then what is?

27:19.680 --> 27:23.719
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

27:23.935 --> 27:27.393
I don't have anyone
else to turn to.

27:27.605 --> 27:31.018
I don't have anything
else but... this.

27:31.234 --> 27:36.445
Yes. You do.

27:36.656 --> 27:39.068
I promise.

27:43.996 --> 27:46.988
What is it about you?

28:00.054 --> 28:01.555
Put his hands all over me.

28:01.764 --> 28:03.265
Put his gun to my chin.

28:03.474 --> 28:05.806
He's lucky I don't
go kung-fu on his ass.

28:06.018 --> 28:07.804
The pig.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.850
[DYSON]
What did you just say?

28:14.068 --> 28:15.729
Pig?

28:15.945 --> 28:17.310
You said pig.

28:17.530 --> 28:20.397
[VEX] I really don't
think I said that.

28:20.616 --> 28:23.574
First vic, his name was
Patrick Murphy. He was a cop.

28:23.786 --> 28:25.868
[DYSON] A pig!

28:26.080 --> 28:27.536
Look at this.

28:27.748 --> 28:29.534
[DYSON] His puncture
wounds on both of his feet.

28:29.750 --> 28:32.958
He was hung upside down.
So he would bleed out quicker.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.831
[LAUREN]
Like a pig in an abattoir.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.457
Yeah.

28:37.425 --> 28:44.137
The second vic, Shane Miller,
he was a prison guard. A bull!

28:44.348 --> 28:47.511
Both men had their throats
slit, they were branded,

28:47.727 --> 28:48.967
[DYSON]
organs removed and burnt,

28:49.186 --> 28:51.142
both men were
hung and bled out.

28:51.355 --> 28:54.563
In Pagan religions, often the pig
and the bull would be...

28:54.775 --> 28:58.108
sacrificed. Yeah,
their blood was spilled.

28:58.321 --> 28:59.356
In order to purify them,

28:59.572 --> 29:01.233
their organs were
offerings up to the gods.

29:01.449 --> 29:02.939
What about the third vic?

29:05.536 --> 29:07.322
No slit throat.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.074
[DYSON]
No puncture wounds.

29:09.290 --> 29:10.871
But he was branded
like the other two.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.744
He died of dehydration.

29:12.960 --> 29:17.499
He was Russian. Served eight
years of a double life sentence.

29:17.715 --> 29:21.424
Hmph. Somebody must've
been a baaad boooy.

29:21.636 --> 29:24.093
Oh come on, copper.
You and me both know.

29:24.305 --> 29:26.546
You shave that much time
off a double life sentence,

29:26.766 --> 29:28.381
you've been talkin'
to the right people.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.886
Yes, a snitch, a rat.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.012
But a rat doesn't fit.

29:31.228 --> 29:33.219
Yeah, but this
is a Russian prison.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.306
Snitch isn't a rat; he's a goat.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.902
Sacrifice to the desert
to cleanse the sins

29:39.111 --> 29:41.443
in hopes of
bringing good fortune.

29:41.656 --> 29:45.774
We're dealing with
a cult here. A Fae cult.

29:45.993 --> 29:47.858
Dyson, those three bodies
from the elevator crash,

29:48.079 --> 29:50.445
they were taken the other night.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.872
Three ritual killings,
three missing bodies.

29:53.084 --> 29:54.324
It could be a connection.

29:54.543 --> 29:56.795
Do you have anything from
the missing bodies with a scent?

29:57.004 --> 29:59.336
Yeah. Yeah I do.

30:31.122 --> 30:32.908
The hunter.

30:33.124 --> 30:34.534
He's gonna kill him.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.207

is the right place?

30:44.427 --> 30:46.338
[DYSON sniffs]

30:46.554 --> 30:49.887
Oh yes. The famed shifter nose.

30:50.099 --> 30:53.512
Yes, it is quite the aquiline
beauty if I must say so.

30:53.728 --> 30:56.891
Slim, slender, and strong.

30:57.106 --> 30:58.562
Can you shut up?

Don't think I've ever tried.

this kid Mark, he's in trouble.

31:11.037 --> 31:11.947
What do you need from me?

31:12.163 --> 31:13.949
If you're close, I need you
to go to Lauren's clinic.

31:14.165 --> 31:15.075
He's gonna kill this hunter.

31:15.291 --> 31:18.499
That's what I smelled at
the clinic. I'm on my way.

angry I get. Oh, right.

get my own drink then.

Stop it, Mark.
What are you doing?

you been hunting me?

31:55.206 --> 31:57.288

Please, Mark!

32:05.174 --> 32:07.210
Why are you hunting me?

32:07.426 --> 32:09.417
Because you're a shifter.

32:10.304 --> 32:12.386

A shifter, like you.

our kind for centuries.

It's been a long time.

32:27.780 --> 32:31.648
We don't hunt Fae anymore,
Kelly. It's forbidden.

who haven't shifted yet.

you're in a lot of pain.

32:55.349 --> 32:56.930
But killing this man
won't change that.

32:57.143 --> 32:58.724
He killed the only family I had.

32:58.936 --> 33:03.771
And our kind killed his.
To him, we're responsible.

33:03.983 --> 33:07.100

something to do with Dyson here

douchebag but...

I smelt him when we met.

34:16.722 --> 34:18.462
What?

34:18.682 --> 34:22.345
I knew there was something
about him that was, uh...

34:22.561 --> 34:24.176
familiar.

34:31.528 --> 34:32.392
[DYSON] Mark, wait.

34:32.613 --> 34:33.477
Leave me alone.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.813

34:36.033 --> 34:38.194
Judging by your age,
your mother would have to be--

34:38.410 --> 34:40.492
[MARK] Don't! You don't
get to say her name.

34:40.704 --> 34:41.955
You bailed and she died.

34:42.164 --> 34:42.994
It wasn't like that.

34:43.207 --> 34:45.619
[MARK] Oh,
then what was it like?

34:45.834 --> 34:46.539
It was--

[MARK] Oh, wait. I don't care.

34:48.921 --> 34:51.037

me she was pregnant.

I say can make it right,

35:01.433 --> 35:04.175
but you can stop running.

35:04.395 --> 35:06.260
You don't have to suffer alone.

35:07.439 --> 35:09.350
You'd just get sick of me.

35:09.566 --> 35:11.852
I'm trouble; everyone says so.

35:12.069 --> 35:15.778
I'm never gonna see it
that way. No matter what.

35:55.279 --> 36:00.319
Honestly, I'm--
these human mood swings, |--

36:00.534 --> 36:01.899
I don't know
how you do it.

36:02.119 --> 36:03.575
[sniffs]

36:03.787 --> 36:05.072
Well, I wish I had
better news for you,

36:05.289 --> 36:06.745
but we have actually
had some setbacks--

36:06.957 --> 36:11.542
[EVONY] Setbacks? Oh, okay.
Well, I've had setbacks too.

36:11.754 --> 36:15.918
Turns out husband wants to turn
the pool house into a man cave.

36:16.133 --> 36:17.839
So I'm gonna have
to store a few little...

36:18.052 --> 36:20.338
odds and ends
here at the clinic.

36:20.554 --> 36:23.091
The clinic that
I paid for. Guards!

36:33.192 --> 36:35.854
Well hello little baby.

36:36.070 --> 36:38.277
[babbles]

36:39.448 --> 36:40.813
[LAUREN] What is that?

36:41.033 --> 36:43.399
Oh, this old thing?

36:43.619 --> 36:46.156
It's only the most feared
creature known to Fae.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.328
But let's just call
it an insurance policy.

36:48.540 --> 36:51.703
Y'know, while I'm human,
so nobody gets any funny ideas.

36:51.919 --> 36:53.705
[EVONY] It won't be too
much trouble for you to

36:53.921 --> 36:56.253
watch it for me,
now will it?

36:56.465 --> 36:57.796
What is it called?

36:58.008 --> 37:01.421
Mmm, nobody knows.
It's that old.

37:01.637 --> 37:06.427
Oh, I really hope something
bad doesn't happen

37:06.642 --> 37:08.348
if it were to escape.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.846
[EVONY]
That would be really bad for you.

37:11.063 --> 37:14.601
Chop, chop!
Serum isn't gonna serum itself.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.567
And this little guy
is running on battery,

37:18.779 --> 37:20.269
and she be gettin' low.

37:20.489 --> 37:23.856
I'd find a power source if
I were you. Tout de suite!

37:47.349 --> 37:50.341
[eerie music plays]

37:50.561 --> 37:54.395
Go ahead. Kill me.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.938
On one condition.

37:57.151 --> 37:58.607
I'm listening.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.486
Mark.

38:03.699 --> 38:06.532
You leave my son alone.

38:06.743 --> 38:09.075
[KELLY] Son?

38:09.288 --> 38:11.825
[chuckles]

38:12.040 --> 38:15.373
You don't say.

38:15.586 --> 38:19.454
Well, just gonna have
to enjoy killin' 'im

38:19.673 --> 38:22.790
all the more. Aren't I?

38:25.179 --> 38:27.511
I thought you might say that.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.133
Vex!

38:37.149 --> 38:40.858
I once made the mistake
of letting a murderer go.

38:41.069 --> 38:44.436
Because I thought it
was the right thing to do.

38:47.242 --> 38:50.234
I won't make that mistake again.

39:00.714 --> 39:05.583
This time I'll
do what feels right.

39:05.802 --> 39:08.509
[g rowls]

39:08.722 --> 39:11.805
[KELLY yells]

39:17.481 --> 39:20.268
A son.

39:20.484 --> 39:21.644
Yup.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.522
Like a full grown...

39:24.738 --> 39:25.818
Sexy”.

39:26.031 --> 39:27.987
Oh, you can never tell
Dyson that this happended.

39:28.200 --> 39:29.155
[chuckles]

39:29.368 --> 39:32.110
I don't know, it's pretty
great roommate leverage.

39:32.329 --> 39:34.320
Plus, I do like
my collars starched.

39:34.540 --> 39:35.325
Tamsin.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.623
I'm kidding.

39:37.834 --> 39:40.746
[TAMSIN]
Hey, my lips are sealed.

39:43.215 --> 39:44.625
You know, there was
a time when I thought

39:44.841 --> 39:47.332
that me and Dyson would...

39:47.553 --> 39:49.965
[TAMSIN] I bet there
was a time for him too.

39:50.180 --> 39:54.970
You guys are good together,
even if it's just as friends.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.058
[BO sighs]

40:02.901 --> 40:08.237
Bo. I just want you to know

40:08.448 --> 40:10.188
that I was hard on
Mark for a good reason.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.274
--[BO] Tamsin.
--[TAMS|N] No.

40:14.413 --> 40:17.280
[TAMSIN] I was hard on him
because I knew he was a liar.

40:17.499 --> 40:18.955
And because I
knew he was trouble.

40:19.167 --> 40:24.878
And, I knew I
was right because...

40:25.090 --> 40:27.297
'Cause he's just like me.

40:29.469 --> 40:32.131
[TAMSIN] When I left Valkyrie
school, I hurt a lot of people.

40:32.347 --> 40:35.089
And I did a lot of things
that I'm not proud of.

40:38.437 --> 40:43.557
Y'know, you and me,

40:43.775 --> 40:46.482
I think we're gonna be okay.

40:49.072 --> 40:50.983
Okay.

41:03.128 --> 41:04.664
Hey.

41:04.880 --> 41:06.791
Hey.

41:13.013 --> 41:14.878
[BO] She's beautiful.

41:15.098 --> 41:18.431
[DYSON] Piper. Mark's mother.

41:19.686 --> 41:22.553
I had heard she died.

41:22.773 --> 41:24.809
Just hadn't heard
that she was pregnant.

41:26.777 --> 41:29.109
Wasn't around to know.

41:31.907 --> 41:35.820
Wasn't big into long
term in those days.

41:36.036 --> 41:41.997
You know, Dyson, this
could be a real blessing.

41:42.209 --> 41:46.327
You have a second
chance. And Mark is--

41:46.546 --> 41:47.956
Bo.

41:49.508 --> 41:53.592
I love you. I do.

41:55.972 --> 42:02.935
[DYSON] I thank
you for stopping by.

42:03.146 --> 42:06.559
But I just wanna be alone
tonight, if that's okay.

42:24.626 --> 42:26.582
[DYSON] Hey, Bo.

42:26.795 --> 42:29.832
Thanks for watching
out for my boy.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.255
He likes you.

42:32.467 --> 42:34.958
And he could use a big sis.

42:35.178 --> 42:36.964
[puffs]

42:37.180 --> 42:39.592
Sis. Yeah.

42:39.808 --> 42:41.048
You know me.

43:31.318 --> 43:36.108

43:36.323 --> 43:41.317
