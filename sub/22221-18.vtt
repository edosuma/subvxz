WEBVTT

00:03.379 --> 00:05.791
Any word on Aeryn or
Doc Rygel yet?

00:05.882 --> 00:07.998
Pilot:
Not as yet, Crichton.

00:08.092 --> 00:09.502
Hey, are you still angry at me?

00:09.594 --> 00:11.880
( laughs )
Cut it out. What do you think?

00:11.971 --> 00:14.132
Look, I got information on the
slave auctions, didn't I?

00:14.223 --> 00:16.430
Quit tripping me.
-D'Argo will be happy.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.259
D'Argo's not going to be happy
if he finds out how you
got the information.

00:19.353 --> 00:23.221
D'Argo won't care how I got the
information as long as | help
him find his son.

00:23.316 --> 00:27.104
Chiana, my little trollop,
he will care.

00:27.195 --> 00:30.187
Look, you needn't worry, okay?

00:30.281 --> 00:32.021
I can look after myself.

00:32.116 --> 00:35.483
Yes, yes, I know. You can kick,
kiss and cry your way out of
any situation.

00:35.578 --> 00:37.660
I just wish you'd stop
getting into them.

00:37.747 --> 00:39.829
You know, we barely got
your ass out of there

00:39.916 --> 00:42.123
before that guy and his
buddies turned nasty.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.917
You're just cranked 'cause
Winona jammed.

00:45.004 --> 00:48.496
Hey, Winona has been
very reliable.

00:48.591 --> 00:51.298
It's not her fault that
she jammed.
-Right.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.637
Aeryn and Rygel had to stay
behind to cover our asses.

00:53.721 --> 00:56.383
You can bet they're going to
be really cranked when
they get back.

00:56.474 --> 00:59.511
Look, Aeryn can yell at me
as much as she likes.

00:59.602 --> 01:02.218
You need to hope that Aeryn
only yells.

01:08.277 --> 01:10.142
Come on, baby.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.618
Chiana.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.086
Good luck.

01:29.173 --> 01:31.880
(whispers ):
Dren. Here we go.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.299
Hey.

01:34.387 --> 01:36.503
You gonna have a go
at me, too?

01:36.597 --> 01:39.259
'Cause Crichton sure isn't
holding back.

01:39.350 --> 01:41.716
I want to apologize for not
looking after you better.

01:41.811 --> 01:46.180
My behavior has been
self-centered and inappropriate.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.265
I don't get it.
-What don't you get?

01:48.359 --> 01:51.897
Crichton:
Well, we just had our asses
whooped saving Chiana.

01:51.988 --> 01:56.027
And you're apologizing to her.
That's scary.

01:56.117 --> 01:59.075
Well, that was in the past,
John. Now we look toward
the future.

01:59.161 --> 02:03.746
Rygel (chuckling ):
We have a surprise for you.

02:03.833 --> 02:05.118
Chiana:
For me?

02:06.836 --> 02:08.451
Oh, will it explode
when | open it?

02:08.546 --> 02:11.754
No, Chiana, you don't
open this.

02:11.841 --> 02:13.126
You embrace it.

02:13.217 --> 02:16.801
Yes, a feeling ofjoy and
contentment so powerful

02:16.887 --> 02:19.549
you'll wonder how you ever
lived without it.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.346
(chuckling)

02:25.146 --> 02:26.761
Something's not right.

02:26.856 --> 02:29.939
Aeryn doesn't even shower
without her Pulse Pistol.

02:32.403 --> 02:35.270
Chiana, go talk to D'Argo.

02:36.365 --> 02:37.525
Yeah.

02:38.784 --> 02:40.035
Where are you going?

02:40.119 --> 02:43.156
We told you, we have a
surprise for you.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.829
It's all right. You can
give it to me later.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.537
Chiana, dear.

02:52.298 --> 02:54.505
It's time to go home.

03:00.431 --> 03:01.671
Aeryn, who the frell is this?

03:01.766 --> 03:03.597
It's all right, John.

03:03.684 --> 03:07.176
Varla helped us and we
in turn must help her.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.104
Chiana:
Ryge...

03:18.240 --> 03:20.322
They're cleansed.

03:21.077 --> 03:22.237
What?

03:24.246 --> 03:26.157
Chiana:
They're cleansed.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.829
No!

03:27.917 --> 03:29.202
I'm never going home!

03:29.293 --> 03:31.534
Do you hear me?!
(metallic click)

03:31.629 --> 03:32.414
Aeryn...

03:32.505 --> 03:33.460
Aeryn!

03:33.547 --> 03:34.457
Don't let me hurt you, Chiana.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.334
Drop the weapon. Let her go.

03:52.108 --> 03:54.224
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:54.318 --> 03:57.481
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.233
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

04:00.324 --> 04:03.908
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

04:03.994 --> 04:04.744
Help me.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.285
Listen, please.

04:06.372 --> 04:08.203
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

04:08.290 --> 04:12.329
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.832
I'm doing everything I can.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.755
I'm just looking for
a way home.

04:52.918 --> 04:53.953
Meelak.

04:54.044 --> 04:56.330
My guide.

04:56.422 --> 04:59.539
I came as soon as I received
your signal.

05:00.551 --> 05:03.634
ls Chiana aboard?
-She is.

05:03.721 --> 05:08.465
And we must honor our fallen
shipmates and deliver her as
soon as possible.

05:08.559 --> 05:12.802
Yes. And... is this
ship contained?

05:12.897 --> 05:14.307
(grunting)

05:14.398 --> 05:16.514
Officer Sun! Aeryn!

05:16.609 --> 05:18.895
Why are you doing this?!

05:18.986 --> 05:21.022
We need your cooperation,
Pilot.

05:21.113 --> 05:23.399
No harm will come to you
if you cooperate.

05:23.491 --> 05:25.777
(growling)

05:25.868 --> 05:32.706
Varla:
Regrettably, your species
nullifies the effects of the mental cleansing process.

05:32.791 --> 05:36.329
Therefore we must resort to
the use of the collar.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.751
( growls )

05:40.883 --> 05:42.623
(electronic beeping )

05:42.718 --> 05:46.757
( groaning )
Please, do as | ask and lwon't
have to use the collar again.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.964
(straining):
What do you want?!

05:50.059 --> 05:55.679
This holds the coordinates
to the nearest Nebari
Territorial Outpost.

05:55.773 --> 05:58.355
We'd like you to take us
there immediately.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.228
(gasps )

06:02.821 --> 06:06.279
Aeryn:
Pilot, Varla's ship had
a run-in with a Peacekeeper patrol,

06:06.367 --> 06:08.608
probably from Scorpius's
Carrier.

06:08.702 --> 06:11.364
Please make sure that Moya's
sensors are on full alert.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.241
The patrol may still be
in the area.

06:13.332 --> 06:18.292
If there is even a chance that
it is, then we need to
Starburst immediately!

06:18.379 --> 06:19.118
(electronic beeping )

06:19.213 --> 06:20.578
(groaning)

06:21.465 --> 06:23.672
Razaric acid!

06:23.759 --> 06:26.250
If this Leviathan goes
into Starburst,

06:26.345 --> 06:30.714
the collar will detect it and
automatically inject
a lethal dose.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.969
We must get to the outpost.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.425
Aeryn:
Please do so, Pilot.

06:34.520 --> 06:36.932
We would not like to lose you.

06:38.649 --> 06:40.856
(groaning weakly)

06:40.943 --> 06:42.934
D'Argo, what do you remember?

06:43.529 --> 06:46.362
l was in Command.

06:46.448 --> 06:52.318
Aeryn came in, with a smile on
her face for no apparent
reason, and then...

06:52.413 --> 06:55.371
Yeah, Aeryn smiling for no
reason. That should have
been our first clue.

06:55.457 --> 06:58.119
Yeah, then she shot me
with some weapon.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.417
I've never seen anything
like it before.

07:01.380 --> 07:04.338
Well wait till they rip
your eyes out.

07:04.425 --> 07:06.757
Yeah, but did they chain
you up, Chiana?

07:08.178 --> 07:10.043
l'm their prize.

07:10.139 --> 07:13.131
Hell, you must be the top
of the $100,000 pyramid,

07:13.225 --> 07:16.308
if they're going to mind
cleanse Aeryn and Rygel
just to get on board.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.431
Mind cleanse?

07:19.815 --> 07:24.149
Chiana, I thought you said
that took 100 cycles?

07:24.236 --> 07:26.101
This is temporary.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.107
lt's drug induced.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.190
Short-term, but just
as effective.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.321
Crichton:
Chiana, let me ask
you a question.

07:33.412 --> 07:36.495
When you first came on board,

07:36.582 --> 07:39.699
Elvis had you in cuffs dragging
you back to Nebari Prime.

07:39.793 --> 07:42.170
Now we got Debra Harry
doing the same thing.

07:42.254 --> 07:47.169
Why are your people so jazzed
about getting you home?
-I don't know.

07:47.259 --> 07:50.717
That woman looks like she's
been through the bad part of
hell just to get near you.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.216
Now, why would she do that?

07:55.893 --> 07:58.384
Chiana, you must tell us.

08:00.439 --> 08:03.181
So, you are the sister.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.231
( D'Argo growling )

08:07.404 --> 08:08.860
Zhaan, help us!

08:08.947 --> 08:10.027
Worry not.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.322
(yelling)

08:12.409 --> 08:13.364
Leave 'em alone!

08:13.452 --> 08:16.615
Soon you will know the
bliss that I know.

08:20.626 --> 08:22.867
Aeryn:
Your wounds are deep.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.872
This one looks badly infected.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.124
My condition is of no concern.

08:27.216 --> 08:31.676
All that matters is that Chiana
is delivered to Nebari
Territorial Control.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.590
Varla, I know this girl.

08:34.682 --> 08:38.174
She isn't even remotely
dangerous to anyone but herself.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.396
Perhaps you don't know her
as well as you think.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.721
Is it something you can
disclose to me?

08:43.816 --> 08:46.774
My people have initiated the
most ambitious plan

08:46.860 --> 08:50.102
to eliminate violent and
aggressive behavior,

08:50.197 --> 08:53.234
and that girl threatens
everything.

08:53.325 --> 08:56.488
It is hard to believe that
Chiana could jeopardize
your efforts.

08:56.578 --> 09:00.867
Well, hopefully, that fear
will become obsolete.

09:00.958 --> 09:03.324
(chains rattle )

09:03.419 --> 09:06.786
Chiana, everybody else on board
has been mind cleansed.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.791
D'Argo's probably in the
spin cycle right now.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.794
That means it's either
you or me next.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.386
Can't be me.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.552
The temporary cleansing doesn't
work for Nebaris.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.470
It's only meant for aliens.

09:17.558 --> 09:21.722
Perfect. l'm next.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.053
Chiana, when these people came
on board, they were after you.

09:24.148 --> 09:27.265
That makes you the "it" girl.
You've got something they
want, what is it?

09:27.359 --> 09:28.974
I don't have anything.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.934
Chiana...

09:35.284 --> 09:38.572
Salis... he kept asking me
about the Resistance.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.118
Some kind of Resistance.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.287
The guy who took D'Argo away.
He called you the sister.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.330
What did he mean, "the sister?"

09:46.086 --> 09:49.374
I've only been sister
to one person.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.170
That's Nerri.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.177
He's dead.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.801
We got to get you out of here.
Get me out of these chains!

09:59.892 --> 10:02.474
Chiana, stop. Stop it, stop.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.560
Look, everybody on board
has secrets.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.683
We all have secrets.

10:07.775 --> 10:10.187
You got one, that's fine.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.188
Keep it.

10:12.279 --> 10:16.022
Right up to the point where
they come to fry my brain.

10:17.159 --> 10:18.615
Now...

10:19.870 --> 10:23.033
when Salis found you, you'd
been running.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.201
Why?

10:28.253 --> 10:32.041
Nerri and | escaped Nebari Prime
when we were really young.

10:34.426 --> 10:37.543
We didn't escape.

10:37.638 --> 10:40.425
The government gave
us Exit Permits.

10:42.351 --> 10:45.309
We didn't know why they
made it so easy.

10:45.395 --> 10:49.604
We didn't care.
We... wejust ran.

10:49.691 --> 10:55.607
It wasn't until two cycles
later that Nerri found out why.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.826
(gasping)

11:03.872 --> 11:06.363
I can't believe how
much it hurts.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.198
I couldn't...
( sharp gasp )

11:08.293 --> 11:10.670
I couldn't believe it either.

11:10.754 --> 11:13.496
But I've been through it.
You will, too.

11:13.590 --> 11:18.550
Once l'm through this, the
contagion will be completely
out of my system?

11:18.637 --> 11:20.719
That's what I was told.

11:20.806 --> 11:23.138
And I won't be spreading
it anymore?

11:23.225 --> 11:25.307
You and me, we're both clean.

11:25.394 --> 11:27.601
Okay.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.521
ljust wish I could say the
same for all the others.

11:33.443 --> 11:36.150
I'll be better when we're
out of here.

11:36.238 --> 11:38.320
When we get off this planet.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.820
Chiana...

11:41.910 --> 11:43.195
I'm not coming with you.

11:43.287 --> 11:46.154
What? What are you
talking about?

11:46.248 --> 11:49.536
Somebody high up in the
Establishment gave me
the antibody.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.241
lsaw him.

11:51.336 --> 11:53.372
He's the one they're after.

11:53.463 --> 11:54.794
I can identify him.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.339
Well then we run. We hide.

11:57.426 --> 12:00.168
That's what we're good at.

12:00.262 --> 12:03.720
This is serious this
time, Chiana.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.923
The Establishment is
trying to infect

12:06.018 --> 12:10.432
as much of the galaxy as it can
with this contagion of theirs.

12:11.440 --> 12:15.228
And they're gonna want to find
out who gave it to us.

12:15.319 --> 12:18.857
And then they're gonna
mind frell me.

12:18.947 --> 12:22.064
I'm coming with you... you.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.327
No.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.652
We're less conspicuous
if we split up.

12:26.747 --> 12:28.408
Oh Nerri...

12:30.208 --> 12:33.871
We will see each other
again, sister.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.169
I swear to you, we will.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.212
(rumbling)

12:42.721 --> 12:47.636
Crichton:
Your own people infected you
with some kind of disease.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.017
Nerri...

12:51.104 --> 12:52.890
me...

12:52.981 --> 12:55.267
hundreds like us.

12:56.360 --> 12:58.692
Maybe thousands.

12:58.779 --> 13:03.364
In the routine physical
examination they so
generously gave us.

13:03.450 --> 13:07.159
And they knew that you'd
go out and transmit it.

13:10.123 --> 13:12.284
How did you, um...

13:15.087 --> 13:16.827
Through carnal contact.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.256
Nerri and l were young.

13:22.177 --> 13:24.543
We did an admirable
job for them.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.090
Chiana...

13:31.186 --> 13:33.177
why didn't you tell us about
this before?

13:33.271 --> 13:36.809
That my people were planning to
frell over as much of the
galaxy as they could?

13:39.403 --> 13:42.861
You barely let me stay aboard
Moya as it was.

13:43.782 --> 13:45.238
Chiana...

13:46.702 --> 13:48.909
they probably think you're
still in contact.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.281
That you might be able to...

13:50.372 --> 13:52.954
(torture device beeping )
(yelling and choking)

13:58.380 --> 14:00.120
( beeping stops and
yelling ceases)

14:01.091 --> 14:03.127
It is his time, Chiana.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.129
Soon it will be yours.

14:05.220 --> 14:09.930
Varla:
The treatment will help you by
removing all negative impulses.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.224
Tell him, D'Argo.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.096
Uh...

14:16.314 --> 14:18.691
it's true, John.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.983
All the things I've done
as a warrior.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.813
All the horrible thoughts I've
had all the cycles of my life.

14:25.907 --> 14:31.368
( sobbing ):
Even about you. I am so sorry!

14:31.997 --> 14:33.578
That's okay, D'Argo.

14:33.665 --> 14:34.529
We'll talk later.

14:34.624 --> 14:37.115
(whimpering):
Okay.

14:37.210 --> 14:39.201
You don't have to do this.

14:39.296 --> 14:40.536
You can just lock me up.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.757
You will thank us after
treatment.

14:42.841 --> 14:45.082
Just stay the hell away from
me. Don't do this!

14:45.177 --> 14:48.715
It is either mind cleansing
or death.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.638
Hey, isn't that against your
Nebari Prime directive?

14:51.725 --> 14:53.716
We are in difficult times.

14:53.810 --> 14:58.645
I'm afraid we must do whatever
necessary to serve the
greater good.

15:06.490 --> 15:08.276
(strangled yell)

15:09.743 --> 15:11.199
(yelling)

15:11.286 --> 15:12.867
Don't struggle.

15:12.954 --> 15:16.287
It only makes this procedure
more painful.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.239
(yells)

15:18.335 --> 15:21.919
The patches will release a
chemical into your
neural system.

15:22.005 --> 15:26.214
You should feel the effects
almost immediately.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.882
(tortured gasp)

15:37.062 --> 15:38.347
(grunting)

15:38.438 --> 15:40.599
Welcome, Chiana.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.473
Would you care for some food?

15:43.568 --> 15:45.775
I'd rather starve.

15:45.862 --> 15:49.946
Please, take my plate.

15:50.033 --> 15:54.276
All your friends are now
free of their old ways.

15:54.371 --> 15:59.991
All their selfish, abhorrent,
violent thoughts have
been eliminated.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.292
You mean drugged away.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.627
Where's your brother?

16:05.841 --> 16:08.958
Where is Nerri, hmm?

16:09.052 --> 16:11.293
My brother?

16:11.847 --> 16:14.509
( soft laugh )

16:15.308 --> 16:18.220
My brother's dead.

16:18.311 --> 16:22.054
He died a quarter of
a cycle ago.

16:22.149 --> 16:27.360
So you can use me all you like,
but you can't get to
him anymore.

16:28.071 --> 16:32.064
Your brother is very much alive.

16:33.201 --> 16:37.615
He was positively identified as
the leader of an assault

16:37.706 --> 16:43.201
on Nebari freight convoys,
less than ten solar days ago.

16:50.594 --> 16:55.554
Meelak:
The Establishment has sent
out many messengers like you and Nerri,

16:55.640 --> 16:59.599
spreading the contagion
for nearly 20 cycles.

16:59.686 --> 17:03.725
Varla:
The contagion spreads quickly.

17:03.815 --> 17:07.433
It shows no outward symptoms.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.109
It merely waits.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.562
Waits for what?

17:11.656 --> 17:15.240
A specific time, Chiana.

17:15.327 --> 17:18.490
Ordained by the Establishment.

17:18.580 --> 17:23.574
Meelak:
We don't expect it to have
infected entire civilizations,

17:23.668 --> 17:27.252
only enough to throw those
worlds into chaos.

17:27.339 --> 17:33.676
So that when our emissaries
arrive, they'll be met by
minimum resistance.

17:34.262 --> 17:36.594
The contagion will...

17:36.681 --> 17:39.764
will take control of everybody
it's infected?

17:42.562 --> 17:45.053
All on the same day.

17:45.148 --> 17:47.764
Hopefully not too long
from now.

17:49.819 --> 17:52.356
Where is Nerri?

17:53.031 --> 17:55.397
I don't know.

17:55.492 --> 17:58.074
( beeping )
(agonized gasp)

18:00.580 --> 18:06.166
You will tell us where he is
or we will simply use you

18:06.253 --> 18:08.744
to bring him out of hiding.

18:08.838 --> 18:12.751
You're not using me again!

18:12.842 --> 18:16.380
( beeping )
(agonized gasping )

18:25.272 --> 18:27.604
( echoing ):
Frell them...

18:27.691 --> 18:30.228
( echoing ):
Frell it...

18:30.318 --> 18:31.774
( echoing ):
Resist.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.237
( echoing ):
Fight it.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.107
( echoing ):
Fight them.

18:35.198 --> 18:36.938
If you've also come to tell me

18:37.033 --> 18:40.400
what a wonderful thing the
Nebari are doing for you,

18:40.495 --> 18:42.781
I am not interested!

18:42.872 --> 18:45.659
( echoing ):
The Nebari is the death of you.

18:47.419 --> 18:50.035
No, Pilot.

18:50.130 --> 18:54.294
I'm here to tell you that the
Nebari are a bunch of geeks!

18:54.384 --> 18:59.629
And their damn mind cleansing
doesn't work on mama
Crichton's baby boy!

18:59.723 --> 19:02.214
John Crichton, astronaut.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.517
Master of the universe. Ah!

19:05.603 --> 19:07.730
Pilot, it's me.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.224
But... how?

19:09.316 --> 19:12.353
I don't know. They gave me the
full monty, and it was working,

19:12.444 --> 19:13.980
and then I got this, this...

19:14.070 --> 19:16.277
this, this...

19:16.364 --> 19:20.232
flash, and it was like it was
soaking up the drug.

19:20.327 --> 19:21.442
I snapped out of it.

19:21.536 --> 19:24.653
And the Nebari?
They don't know?

19:24.748 --> 19:26.534
(surf dude accent):
Crap, man.

19:26.624 --> 19:30.287
I drool with the best
of 'em, dude.

19:30.378 --> 19:32.414
(chuckling)

19:33.673 --> 19:35.755
What is it they want?

19:35.842 --> 19:39.551
They have some vast plot to
take over a chunk of the galaxy.

19:39.637 --> 19:44.472
Ah, Varla gave me the
coordinates to a Nebari outpost.

19:44.559 --> 19:45.844
We're on our way there.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.062
Can't you veer off course,
slow down, or something?

19:48.146 --> 19:51.764
Officer Sun comes in often,
checks the readouts on my panel.

19:51.858 --> 19:54.224
And Starburst is out
of the question.

19:54.319 --> 19:58.153
If I attempt it, this frelling
collar will kill me instantly.

19:58.239 --> 20:03.154
We've got Nebari aboard, most
everybody is mind cleansed,

20:03.244 --> 20:06.202
and there's a Peacekeeper patrol
in the immediate vicinity.

20:06.289 --> 20:07.244
Peacekeeper patrol?

20:07.332 --> 20:09.869
That's why most of Varla's
crew is dead.

20:09.959 --> 20:13.201
Their transport came under
attack by a Peacekeeper patrol.

20:13.296 --> 20:14.752
Well, keep cussin', man.

20:14.839 --> 20:17.831
I sure as hell can't get this
collar off without some help.

20:17.926 --> 20:21.043
It is the ultimate gift, Chiana.

20:21.137 --> 20:27.007
Any other life course only
leads to pain and suffering.

20:27.102 --> 20:28.763
Look at you.

20:28.853 --> 20:30.935
You wouldn't have to be
bound like this

20:31.022 --> 20:34.310
if you were to give yourself up
to serve the greater good.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.143
What good could come of
infecting your own people

20:37.237 --> 20:41.401
and then sending them out to
infect as many others
as possible?!

20:41.491 --> 20:45.234
You and Nerri and
those like you,

20:45.328 --> 20:49.446
we merely found another way
for you to serve.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.906
(yells)

20:53.336 --> 20:54.746
What are you doing?

20:54.838 --> 20:59.207
Oh, you know, Moya's amnexus
system is like in flux,

20:59.300 --> 21:04.886
so I'm just sort of, you know,
looking for the source.

21:04.973 --> 21:08.306
Will that affect the safety
and speed of this ship?

21:08.393 --> 21:12.682
Ch'yuh! Hey, totally screw
the pooch, babe.

21:15.358 --> 21:18.771
Very well. Proceed.
Thank you for your service.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.151
Cool.

21:21.239 --> 21:23.855
It's for the greater good.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.067
She gonna get ya, get ya,
getya,getya.

21:27.162 --> 21:28.777
How you doing?

21:28.872 --> 21:30.237
Get out of here.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.117
Leave me alone.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.039
Chiana, dear...

21:34.127 --> 21:35.162
I'm not mind cleansed.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.914
Yeah, right!

21:37.005 --> 21:38.495
You know, I don't have
time for this.

21:38.590 --> 21:39.830
What is this, some half
kelled attempt

21:39.924 --> 21:41.334
to make me tell you
where Nerri is...

21:46.181 --> 21:48.718
You're really not cleansed?

21:48.808 --> 21:52.847
No. My thoughts are as
dirty as ever.

21:52.937 --> 21:55.314
(trembling laughter)

21:57.901 --> 22:01.314
My god. I thought...
I thought I was all alone.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.769
I thought... I thought
you were...

22:02.864 --> 22:05.150
Oh, no, you're not going to
cry on me, now, are you?

22:05.241 --> 22:07.152
Hey, you got a plan?

22:07.243 --> 22:08.699
A plan. No.

22:08.786 --> 22:11.323
We got no weapons,
the DRDs are switched off,

22:11.414 --> 22:15.248
and we gotta find a way to
get D'Argo or Aeryn back
on our side.

22:15.335 --> 22:16.871
There's no way.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.167
Why not?

22:18.254 --> 22:21.087
Hell, Durka did something that
busted his brain washing.

22:21.174 --> 22:25.008
No. This temporary cleansing
is drug induced.

22:25.094 --> 22:26.675
It's got to be metabolized.

22:26.763 --> 22:29.220
( low rumbling vibration )

22:31.059 --> 22:31.718
Hey, Crichton.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.140
(grunting)

22:33.228 --> 22:34.843
Crichton, you okay?

22:34.938 --> 22:36.894
( echoing ):
Snap out... snap out...
snap out...

22:36.981 --> 22:38.482
Hey.

22:39.275 --> 22:41.357
Oh, I'm fine. I'm, uh...

22:41.444 --> 22:43.355
I'm fine.

22:43.446 --> 22:45.107
Just fine.

22:46.074 --> 22:47.234
What?

22:47.325 --> 22:48.235
Wha...?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.905
Uh... Rygel.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.703
Rygel, he's... he's got
a great metabolism.

22:55.375 --> 22:56.865
Yes, he does.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.325
Yes, he does.

23:01.381 --> 23:03.042
(falsetto babbling)

23:07.387 --> 23:11.346
Hey dude, how they
hanging, man?

23:11.432 --> 23:13.593
Just, uh, perfect.

23:13.685 --> 23:15.801
Thank you so much for
your concern.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.477
Oh... munchies.

23:20.692 --> 23:23.149
Don't eat so much, though.
You'll Belushi out, cat.

23:23.236 --> 23:27.570
Hynerian physiology.
Three stomachs.
( chuckles )

23:27.657 --> 23:30.239
Whoa, three stomachs.
Whoa, hey, don't go away.

23:30.326 --> 23:31.736
Don't stop eating.

23:31.828 --> 23:32.817
What's the matter?

23:32.912 --> 23:34.698
Your food doesn't taste good?

23:34.789 --> 23:36.154
(giggles )

23:36.249 --> 23:39.286
Hey, three tummies, dude.

23:39.377 --> 23:41.083
You could be clean, man.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.626
( laughs )

23:42.714 --> 23:43.829
(slaps)

23:43.923 --> 23:45.254
Please don't tell them!

23:45.341 --> 23:46.547
Rygel. Rygel, calm down.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.170
Please, Crichton! I don't want
my eyes sucked out again.

23:48.261 --> 23:51.298
Sparky, shut up! It's me!
-I like my eyes where they are!

23:51.389 --> 23:53.220
(gasping and panting)

23:55.268 --> 23:57.759
You mean, you're not
affected, either?

23:57.854 --> 24:00.812
No, I'm not affected.
Now, keep your voice down.

24:00.898 --> 24:03.435
I've been having these...
oh, forget about that.

24:03.526 --> 24:06.108
Right now we got to do
something, and I mean fast.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.151
We?
-Yes. You, me and Pilot...

24:08.239 --> 24:09.524
we're the only ones who
aren't Nebari puppets.

24:09.616 --> 24:11.106
I'm nobody's puppet!

24:11.200 --> 24:14.738
I don't know what you're
suggesting but I'm not
angering these people.

24:14.829 --> 24:19.198
They're not mad at me, and
that's how it's going to stay.

24:19.292 --> 24:21.749
Buckwheat, I need your help.

24:21.836 --> 24:23.246
Mmm.

24:25.256 --> 24:29.124
Exactly what do you want the
Hynerian to help you do,
Crichton?

24:29.218 --> 24:32.836
Rygel:
Oh, I'm so grateful
you're here.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.216
He needs help. Lots of help.

24:35.308 --> 24:37.390
I don't think the mind
cleansing is working...

24:37.477 --> 24:38.842
( socks )

24:42.815 --> 24:44.771
Obviously, not.

24:52.909 --> 24:55.275
Was this part of your plan?

24:55.370 --> 24:57.782
You have something planned?

25:00.249 --> 25:03.286
Are there any communication
devices here?

25:03.378 --> 25:05.164
No, you grolash.

25:05.254 --> 25:09.167
You took them away from us
right before you and your
girlfriend decided...

25:16.349 --> 25:18.465
Are we missing something here?

25:18.559 --> 25:21.301
We don't have much time.

25:23.314 --> 25:24.770
This...

25:24.857 --> 25:28.475
can only be activated by
contacting your DNA.

25:41.708 --> 25:44.495
Hey, little sister.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.291
I told you we'd see
each other again.

25:46.379 --> 25:50.372
Hmm, well, at least you're
seeing me.

25:50.466 --> 25:54.254
A lot of things have changed
since we saw each other last.

25:54.345 --> 25:56.506
I don't know how much you know
about what it is I'm doing

25:56.597 --> 26:00.590
but it's important work,
very important.

26:02.437 --> 26:04.428
( laughs )
Work.

26:04.522 --> 26:07.514
Do you believe I've been doing
something like that?

26:07.608 --> 26:11.726
| wish you could be part of it.
But it's kind of dangerous.

26:11.821 --> 26:15.154
Wherever it is you are right
now, you're probably
better off there.

26:16.659 --> 26:19.150
Whoever gave you this image
disk is one of my people.

26:19.245 --> 26:21.076
Treat them well.
They are a friend.

26:21.164 --> 26:24.156
But they are also under my
strictest orders not to
take you to me.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.662
It's far too hazardous.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.493
Maybe someday when things
get safer...

26:28.588 --> 26:30.249
Nerri, they're coming.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.334
Look, ljust wanted you to know
that I'm alive and well,

26:36.429 --> 26:38.511
for now, at least.

26:38.598 --> 26:43.683
Keep yourself well-hidden,
little sister, and out
of harm's reach.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.890
I love you dearly.

26:48.775 --> 26:51.107
(sobbing)

26:52.236 --> 26:54.227
Nerri.

26:54.322 --> 26:59.442
The only thing that Nerri
cares more about than the
resistance is you.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.275
You got to get me out of here.

27:01.370 --> 27:03.952
Yeah, you got to take
me to him.

27:04.582 --> 27:06.072
You heard the message.

27:06.167 --> 27:08.249
He only wants you to know
that he's alive.

27:08.336 --> 27:11.749
He doesn't want you to get
involved doing what we're doing.

27:11.839 --> 27:15.457
No, I want to help him.
Help the cause, please.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.711
Shh...

27:16.803 --> 27:20.261
If Varla hears you, we'll
all be frelled.

27:24.644 --> 27:26.305
All right.

27:27.188 --> 27:28.928
So, what do we do now?

27:29.023 --> 27:32.641
You know our secret, we know
yours. We're kind of
at a standoff.

27:32.735 --> 27:37.104
I have some data that I've got
to get back to Nerri and
the others.

27:37.198 --> 27:41.692
As soon as we hit the outpost,
I'm going to take the
expresser out of there.

27:44.205 --> 27:46.116
You two are on your own.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.493
So, he cares enough to send
you with a message,

27:48.584 --> 27:53.169
but he doesn't care if she
gets mind-cleansed?

27:53.256 --> 27:59.217
If I help you, then I
jeopardize my position and all
those that are depending on me.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.919
If you don't take me with you

28:02.014 --> 28:04.266
I'll tell Varla everything.

28:06.143 --> 28:10.352
Go on. Threaten me with that.

28:10.439 --> 28:15.775
Tell her how your friend here
somehow avoided the temporary
mind cleanse.

28:25.246 --> 28:29.159
Crichton:
Well if we don't do something
soon, Pilot, we will all be speaking Nebari.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.205
What can we...

28:30.293 --> 28:33.000
Hey, Varla and Meelak's
transport.

28:33.087 --> 28:35.829
They said they got chased by a
Peacekeeper patrol, right?

28:35.923 --> 28:36.753
Yes.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.251
It's perfect, I got an idea.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.503
What if we made them think
that it came back?

28:40.595 --> 28:42.551
I... don't understand.

28:42.638 --> 28:46.472
Is there some way that you and
Moya could fake them hunting
us down?

28:46.559 --> 28:49.892
Make Varla think that the
Peacekeeper patrol...

28:49.979 --> 28:52.391
Both:
had come back?

28:53.983 --> 28:56.941
There are some vid images
in Moya's data stores.

28:57.028 --> 29:01.192
I could cyber-manipulate one to
appear on the forward portal.

29:01.282 --> 29:02.988
All right, do it, get started,
all of it.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.611
I'm gonna get D'Argo
and Aeryn...

29:04.702 --> 29:06.192
Wait, Commander!

29:06.287 --> 29:09.199
All DRD functions have
been shut down,

29:09.290 --> 29:11.201
and this isn't something
I can do from here.

29:11.292 --> 29:17.253
Someone has to make the
hardwire circuitry connections
in Moya's neural cluster.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.705
I'm gonna need help.

29:21.260 --> 29:26.050
Oh, Rygel, where are you
my little husky?

29:26.140 --> 29:29.257
l have a stick for you.

29:29.352 --> 29:32.469
(whistling)

29:33.397 --> 29:35.934
Where are you, boy?

29:37.234 --> 29:39.316
( squeaking )

29:42.698 --> 29:44.234
Oh, my.

29:46.118 --> 29:48.985
Eenie, meeinie, minie...

29:49.080 --> 29:50.115
(shouting):
Mo!

29:50.206 --> 29:51.696
(clattering )

29:56.253 --> 29:58.869
Oh! Oh, uh...
( laughs nervously)

29:58.965 --> 30:01.798
Hello. Uh, I felt it
best if I...

30:01.884 --> 30:06.048
Best if you hid until all my
violent thoughts had been wiped?

30:06.138 --> 30:09.255
I didn't want to disturb
the process.

30:09.350 --> 30:12.183
You are cleansed, aren't you?
-No.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.260
( grunts )
Rygel, as you may notice,

30:14.355 --> 30:16.937
my nasty urges have not
been suppressed.

30:17.024 --> 30:18.230
Crichton, what the yotz
are you...

30:18.317 --> 30:20.603
Shut up, you miserable excuse
for a life.

30:20.695 --> 30:23.687
I'm sick of having you sell us
out every chance you get.

30:23.781 --> 30:26.614
I don't do it every chance,
believe me.

30:26.701 --> 30:29.693
Don't you 8.8. me, Guido!

30:29.787 --> 30:31.994
You're on the first transport
out of here.

30:32.081 --> 30:33.321
On the contrary.

30:33.416 --> 30:37.079
I was looking forward to
reaching the Nebari outpost.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.955
We're not getting out
of this one.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.161
These are the Nebari.

30:40.256 --> 30:41.962
Ne-ba-ri.

30:42.049 --> 30:44.290
What happens when you get to
the outpost, Buckwheat?

30:44.385 --> 30:47.843
You let them strap you in and
give you the deluxe brainwash?

30:47.930 --> 30:50.546
They only cleanse those
who don't conform.

30:50.641 --> 30:54.884
I can be the go-along guy if it
means being part of the action.

30:54.979 --> 30:57.516
You aren't into
self-preservation.

30:57.606 --> 31:00.769
You are the king of it!

31:00.860 --> 31:02.646
Not king. Dominar.

31:02.737 --> 31:06.104
Well, I'm not ready to roll
over and be mind frelled.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.281
Pilot and l have a plan and
you are gonna help.

31:09.368 --> 31:11.199
And if I refuse?

31:11.287 --> 31:13.903
( shouting ):
Hey everybody!

31:13.998 --> 31:16.239
Rygel's not mind-cleansed.

31:16.333 --> 31:18.164
Shh. Crichton.
-He's not conforming.

31:18.252 --> 31:19.617
He's faking it, man.

31:19.712 --> 31:21.327
Hey, maybe we should
double his dose.

31:21.422 --> 31:22.411
SHence!

31:22.506 --> 31:23.621
You get the point?

31:23.716 --> 31:26.207
Aeryn:
What's all this noise?

31:28.220 --> 31:30.336
Oh hey, Aeryn.

31:30.431 --> 31:33.298
Yeah, uh, I was just
yelling for Rygel.

31:33.392 --> 31:38.762
He's going to uh, uh, help me,
uh, fix a leak in one of the
amnexus conduits.

31:38.856 --> 31:40.392
Yes, yes.
-Cool.

31:40.483 --> 31:42.599
I thought D'Argo was
doing that.

31:42.693 --> 31:43.728
Yes, he is.

31:43.819 --> 31:46.652
No, no. No, D'Argo, he's, uh...

31:46.739 --> 31:48.320
he's not well.
-No, no.

31:48.407 --> 31:51.319
So we told him that we
could do it.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.026
Yeah, it's no problem.
No problem at all.

31:54.121 --> 31:55.907
Come on, little buddy.

31:55.998 --> 31:57.738
Up you go, little buddy!

31:57.833 --> 32:01.701
Oh, yeah, hey, we're going to
go do a service for the
greater good.

32:01.796 --> 32:03.127
Bye!

32:03.756 --> 32:04.836
Cool.

32:04.924 --> 32:06.960
(thud )
Oh!
-Oh, hey, whoa!

32:07.051 --> 32:09.292
Sorry, man. Come on. Whoa!

32:09.386 --> 32:11.342
It's going to be more
real than real.

32:11.430 --> 32:15.014
It's gonna be super 3-D
smell-o-vision in sensurround.

32:15.101 --> 32:16.682
But you have to do your part.

32:16.769 --> 32:19.511
Okay.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.142
Well how do you suppose I get
Varla to the Command?

32:22.233 --> 32:25.100
I don't know, but you're a smart
girl. You'll figure that out.

32:25.194 --> 32:28.277
Just make sure you give me half
an arn before you get started.

32:30.241 --> 32:31.401
Hey, old man?

32:32.827 --> 32:36.035
Ultra omnivision, man, whoa!

32:42.711 --> 32:45.088
D'Argo, are you feeling better?

32:46.257 --> 32:49.124
I've never felt any better.

32:49.218 --> 32:51.209
That's strange.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.259
Crichton said you were
feeling ill.

32:53.347 --> 32:57.932
( clinking )
Hey, Sparky, pass me some
more plexus cable.

32:58.018 --> 32:59.349
(crackling)
Oh!

32:59.436 --> 33:02.223
Oh, no way. Hey, don't...
don't do that.

33:02.314 --> 33:03.429
You're gonna get us killed.

33:03.524 --> 33:06.140
It'll only save the Nebari
the trouble later.

33:06.235 --> 33:07.145
Pilot:
Crichton.

33:07.236 --> 33:08.066
Yeah, Pilot.

33:08.154 --> 33:10.270
| suggest you and Rygel hurry.

33:10.364 --> 33:13.481
It appears Chiana already has
the Nebari up on the Command.

33:13.576 --> 33:16.693
Already?
-Yes, and l have nothing
to show them.

33:16.787 --> 33:17.867
Oh, hell.

33:22.251 --> 33:23.582
Varla:
So, Chiana...

33:23.669 --> 33:27.082
(torture device beeping )
(chokes and gasps)

33:27.173 --> 33:31.257
I told you I was ready
to cooperate.

33:31.343 --> 33:33.049
I don't wanna be cleansed.

33:34.138 --> 33:37.130
I don't need to be cleansed.

33:37.224 --> 33:40.216
That's what I wanna
prove to you.

33:40.311 --> 33:43.098
You said you know where
Nerri is hiding.

33:43.189 --> 33:47.228
Yes... I know.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.484
And I'm ready to tell you.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.026
I told her to wait half an arn.

33:55.117 --> 33:56.857
It has been half an em,
Crichton.

33:56.952 --> 33:58.863
Yeah, well, we're not
ready yet.

34:02.458 --> 34:03.823
What are you two doing?

34:03.918 --> 34:08.207
Oh, great! Just what we need.
A Iobotomized Luxan.

34:11.342 --> 34:14.550
Hey hey, guys. How you doing?

34:14.637 --> 34:16.127
You want to give us
a hand, here?

34:16.222 --> 34:20.090
You know, Moya amnexus conduits
are really frelled.

34:20.184 --> 34:23.176
A lot worse than I thought.
-Totally frelled.

34:23.270 --> 34:28.355
But I finished adjusting the
amnexus conduits myself
less than an em ago.

34:28.442 --> 34:33.607
Aeryn:
So, if you're not fixing the
amnexus conduits, that would mean that you just lied.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.358
Which would indicate...

34:35.449 --> 34:36.655
That you are...

34:36.742 --> 34:39.575
Both:
no longer mind cleansed.

34:39.662 --> 34:41.323
Wow.

34:41.413 --> 34:47.079
You know, you're both
really mistaken.

34:47.169 --> 34:49.376
But if you don't want to help,
just leave me alone.

34:49.463 --> 34:51.249
I can work in peace, man.

34:51.340 --> 34:54.423
No, I think we all need
to go and see Varla.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.302
I can't do that, Aeryn.

34:58.389 --> 35:01.176
Then you really leave us
no choice.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.552
( D'Argo hisses)

35:02.643 --> 35:04.634
Hey...

35:04.728 --> 35:09.768
You know, I thought that mind
cleansing removed
inappropriate behaviors.

35:09.858 --> 35:13.897
You know it really pains us
to do this to you, John.

35:13.988 --> 35:16.855
But you have left us
no other options.

35:16.949 --> 35:18.564
Drop what you're doing
now, Rygel.

35:18.659 --> 35:19.990
But I...

35:20.077 --> 35:21.783
Crichton:
Hey, Ryg...

35:21.870 --> 35:23.451
it's a good idea, man.

35:23.539 --> 35:24.995
Drop what you're doing.

35:25.082 --> 35:26.618
Are you completely farhbot?

35:26.709 --> 35:29.621
Just... don't argue.

35:29.712 --> 35:31.327
It's inappropriate.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.126
Ah... ah.

35:35.217 --> 35:38.459
Hmm, if you insist.

35:42.182 --> 35:43.388
( D'Argo yells)

35:46.395 --> 35:48.101
( chuckles )

35:50.399 --> 35:52.310
Bitchin', man.
-Bitchin'.

35:53.444 --> 35:55.309
(torture device beeping )

35:55.404 --> 35:57.645
(choking and gasping)

35:57.740 --> 36:00.277
This is not a game, child.

36:00.367 --> 36:03.200
You said had information about
Nerri's whereabouts.

36:03.287 --> 36:05.699
Either you do, or you don't.

36:05.789 --> 36:07.120
You got to give me some time.

36:07.207 --> 36:10.165
I'm a slum kid from the south
Walapawn province.

36:13.422 --> 36:17.756
Hey, Varla, I've got something
of great urgency to tell you.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.426
Wow. Is everything cool?

36:22.806 --> 36:24.842
What is it you want to tell me?

36:24.933 --> 36:29.017
It appears as though we're
being shadowed by a
Peacekeeper patrol.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.311
Servicer, report.

36:31.398 --> 36:32.934
Commander Crichton is correct.

36:33.025 --> 36:37.064
Moya's senses are detecting
a squadron of Prowlers
closing fast.

36:37.154 --> 36:38.439
Prepare for confrontation.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.940
With what?

36:40.032 --> 36:43.240
She's a Leviathan.
She doesn't have any weapons.

36:43.327 --> 36:44.407
How screwed does that make ya?

36:44.495 --> 36:46.110
(torture device beeping )
(gasping )

36:46.205 --> 36:49.743
This vessel is large enough to
withstand a Prowler attack.

36:49.833 --> 36:52.210
Maintain course and
increase speed.

36:52.294 --> 36:54.205
The Prowlers are not alone.

36:54.296 --> 36:57.629
They have a vanguard of a full
Peacekeeper Command Carrier.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.423
Has the larger vessel
located us yet?

37:00.511 --> 37:01.751
Affirmative.

37:01.845 --> 37:04.131
It has just entered Moya's
sense horizon.

37:04.223 --> 37:05.759
Do we have visual?

37:05.849 --> 37:07.714
On forward portal.

37:09.520 --> 37:10.805
Whoa.

37:10.896 --> 37:12.306
Detail.

37:15.943 --> 37:17.308
Whoa.

37:17.403 --> 37:18.939
How could they find us?

37:19.029 --> 37:21.361
Initiate defensive maneuvers.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.611
The only defensive maneuver
Moya's got is... is Starburst.

37:24.701 --> 37:29.115
And I am restrained from
Starburst, upon penalty
of death.

37:29.206 --> 37:32.573
Maybe we should let the Pilot
go, then we can escape.

37:32.668 --> 37:35.751
Varla:
No. Maintain course
at all costs.

37:35.838 --> 37:38.045
The safety of our rendezvous
point is near.

37:38.132 --> 37:41.340
The Command Carrier's Frag
Cannons have locked and
targetted us.

37:41.427 --> 37:44.214
They wouldn't fire before
contacting us...

37:44.638 --> 37:45.627
would they?

37:45.722 --> 37:47.007
They're firing!

37:47.933 --> 37:49.673
I cannot out-turn it.

37:49.768 --> 37:51.759
Impact in three microts.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.765
Direct hit! Upper canopy.

37:57.860 --> 38:01.444
Uh, yeah, Pilot.
Uh, damage assessment.

38:01.530 --> 38:06.240
Outer hull breach. Primary and
secondary iriscentent fluid
bladders ruptured.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.408
Sealing off areas immediately!

38:08.495 --> 38:11.157
Directional stabilizers
vaponzed.

38:11.248 --> 38:13.455
Klestron filters
non-operational!

38:13.542 --> 38:16.033
Manuever from their
range, Pilot.

38:16.128 --> 38:19.541
I cannot! My control of the
ship is decreasing with each...

38:19.631 --> 38:22.919
Another salvo!
Prepare for impact!

38:23.677 --> 38:25.008
(grunting)

38:29.391 --> 38:30.380
( beeping )

38:30.476 --> 38:32.307
(choking and gasping)

38:41.695 --> 38:43.731
Attention, Leviathan.

38:43.822 --> 38:45.904
I am Captain... Captain Crais.

38:45.991 --> 38:49.449
Command... Commander of the
Peacekeeper Pleisar Regiment.

38:49.536 --> 38:51.322
Our sens... sensors detect
the presence aboard...

38:51.413 --> 38:54.200
aboard your vessel of a...
a Nebari Star Runner

38:54.291 --> 38:55.781
which we have been pursuing.

38:55.876 --> 38:57.958
A boarding party has been
despatched.

38:58.045 --> 38:59.956
Do not... do not attempt
to turn them away.

39:00.047 --> 39:04.256
If you do, it will mean
destruction of your ship.

39:04.343 --> 39:09.337
I warn you, do not...
do not test me.

39:09.431 --> 39:11.922
How far to the
rendezvous point?

39:12.017 --> 39:13.598
You'll never make it.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.391
( beeping )

39:16.396 --> 39:17.681
How far?

39:17.773 --> 39:19.354
Still at least one am.

39:19.441 --> 39:22.353
Meelak:
Do you have any capability of
outrunning this pursuer?

39:22.444 --> 39:24.355
Not without Starbursting.

39:24.446 --> 39:27.233
And one more direct hit and
even that will be gone.

39:27.324 --> 39:29.861
Crichton:
Hey, we really ought to cut
the collar off that Pilot

39:29.952 --> 39:31.783
so we can Starburst, you know?

39:31.870 --> 39:34.907
There is no time to Starburst.
( beeping )

39:34.998 --> 39:39.037
If the Peacekeepers get the
girl she'll lead them to Nerri.

39:39.127 --> 39:40.663
( beeping )
( choking )

39:40.754 --> 39:44.588
And that will mean Peacekeeper's
aid to the resistance.

39:46.134 --> 39:47.965
No!
-Hey, no.

39:48.053 --> 39:51.545
Hey, you know that that goes
against everything Nebari
stand for man!

39:51.640 --> 39:54.302
You can'tjust kill her
in cold blood.

39:54.393 --> 39:58.602
All is forgiven if it is in the
service of the greater good.

39:58.689 --> 40:00.270
Please...

40:04.319 --> 40:06.184
Give me your gun!
-No.

40:06.280 --> 40:08.521
You'll have to choose between
these woman. You have to choose.

40:08.615 --> 40:09.195
No!

40:09.283 --> 40:10.568
(grunts)

40:14.371 --> 40:15.861
( beeping )

40:17.040 --> 40:18.746
(gasping)

40:19.918 --> 40:22.204
You are senior here, Varla.

40:22.296 --> 40:28.587
But I resist the temptation to
terminate the prize that we
were sent to retrieve!

40:29.928 --> 40:31.543
No!
-Varla, no!

40:36.685 --> 40:38.471
Crichton:
Hey you know, you don't
have to kill her.

40:38.562 --> 40:41.304
This entire Peacekeeper
expenence?

40:41.398 --> 40:42.854
It's a ruse.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.603
No Peacekeeper Command Carrier?

40:45.694 --> 40:47.230
Pilot? Terminate the simulation.

40:47.321 --> 40:50.404
But Commander, the vessel
attacking us is real!

40:52.284 --> 40:54.115
Cut the crap, Pilot!

40:54.202 --> 40:56.238
Terminate the simulation!

41:04.796 --> 41:09.381
If I had released Pilot's
control collar?

41:09.468 --> 41:13.131
We would Starburst away from
your rendezvous point,

41:13.221 --> 41:15.257
you foul skank.

41:15.349 --> 41:16.213
( beeping )

41:16.308 --> 41:17.673
(yells)

41:19.227 --> 41:25.393
You see, Meelak, discipline and
faith defeats any insurgence.

41:25.484 --> 41:27.224
(yelling)

41:37.412 --> 41:38.401
(yells)

41:38.497 --> 41:39.987
( loud thud )

41:44.336 --> 41:48.375
You... betrayed me.

41:51.927 --> 41:56.671
And you have betrayed the
spirit of our people.

42:12.447 --> 42:14.529
Sorry you had to do that.

42:19.204 --> 42:21.536
I had no choice.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.448
Hey Pip, you okay?

42:26.753 --> 42:29.244
Yeah... yeah.

42:29.339 --> 42:30.203
Pilot:
Crichton...

42:30.298 --> 42:32.038
did that work for you?

42:32.134 --> 42:34.716
I thought it worked.
Hmm, definitely.

42:34.803 --> 42:36.885
Yeah, Pilot.

42:36.972 --> 42:38.963
You're the best.

42:39.391 --> 42:41.302
You were great.

42:47.315 --> 42:48.930
( D'Argo growling )

42:49.025 --> 42:51.232
Just how long do you intend to
keep us in here for, Rygel?

42:51.319 --> 42:56.109
( chuckles )
As long as it takes for the
mind cleansing to wear off.

42:56.199 --> 42:57.939
It has frelling worn off.

42:58.034 --> 43:02.243
Zhaan:
Isn't it obvious, sweet Rygel,
that we are no longer cleansed?

43:02.330 --> 43:04.867
Must be absolutely certain.

43:04.958 --> 43:08.166
We were in the vicinity of the
slave auctions where
my son was sold,

43:08.253 --> 43:10.289
and you are wasting my time!

43:10.380 --> 43:12.462
Pilot is already plotting
a course.

43:12.549 --> 43:17.839
There's nothing left for you to
do but stay in there and
metabolize.

43:17.929 --> 43:18.588
(growling)

43:18.680 --> 43:20.011
(laughing)

43:25.353 --> 43:26.604
I'm coming with you.

43:26.688 --> 43:28.974
Nerri asked me not to bring you.

43:29.065 --> 43:31.898
He's my leader.
I do what he says.

43:31.985 --> 43:34.021
No. Hey, hey, hey...

43:34.112 --> 43:37.400
Nerri doesn't know what he's
talking about, all right?

43:37.491 --> 43:41.234
I'm three cycles younger than
him and I had to teach
him how to...

43:41.328 --> 43:42.317
how to cinch his shoes.

43:42.412 --> 43:45.495
I figure if I limp across
the Nebari boundary,

43:45.582 --> 43:50.042
and tell him we were attacked
and everybody else was killed,
they might believe me.

43:51.296 --> 43:55.710
And, I still have information
vital to the Resistance.

43:55.801 --> 43:57.337
But I wanna help!

43:57.427 --> 43:59.292
Chiana.

43:59.387 --> 44:01.878
He's right. It's for the best.

44:01.973 --> 44:05.682
If you go into Nebari territory
you will be recognized
and arrested.

44:07.896 --> 44:09.887
Nerri's alive.

44:10.941 --> 44:13.557
ljust... I wanna see him.

44:13.652 --> 44:16.234
I understand.

44:16.321 --> 44:18.983
But you cannot compromise
what he's doing.

44:22.035 --> 44:23.400
Your brother's alive.

44:23.495 --> 44:25.531
He's alive.

44:26.623 --> 44:28.705
Take that.

44:31.211 --> 44:33.327
It's more than you had
yesterday.

44:34.464 --> 44:36.329
I want to go to him.

44:36.633 --> 44:39.090
I know.

44:39.177 --> 44:42.044
But since when do people like
us get what we want?

44:42.138 --> 44:44.345
(engines starting )
