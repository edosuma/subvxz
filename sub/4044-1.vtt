06:51.828 --> 06:53.829
BRENT:
What do we care if we were expelled?

06:54.080 --> 06:56.873
The war's gonna start,
so we would've left anyhow.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.834
War! Isn’t it exciting, Scarlett?

06:59.043 --> 07:01.586
-Those fool Yankees want a war.
BRENT: We'll show them!

07:01.838 --> 07:04.506
Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war!

07:04.757 --> 07:07.592
This war talk's spoiling
all the fun at every party.

07:07.802 --> 07:10.178
I get so bored I could scream.

07:10.388 --> 07:12.597
Besides, there isn't
going to be any war.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.767
BRENT: Not gonna be any war?
-Of course there'll be a war.

07:16.018 --> 07:18.478
If either of you boys
says "war" once again...

07:18.729 --> 07:20.021
...I'll go in the house.

07:20.273 --> 07:23.316
-But, Scarlett!
-Don't you want us to have a war?

07:23.526 --> 07:26.486
BRENT: Wait a minute, honey, please!
STUART: We're sorry.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.740
SCARLETT:
Well....

07:31.617 --> 07:34.619
But remember, I warned you.

07:34.871 --> 07:36.204
I've got an idea!

07:36.456 --> 07:38.874
We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue
at Twelve Oaks.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.543
You're eating barbecue with us,
aren't you?

07:41.752 --> 07:44.754
I haven't thought about that yet.
I'll think about that tomorrow.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.089
We want all your waltzes.

07:46.257 --> 07:48.675
First Brent, then me,
then Brent, and so on.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.636
-Promise?
-Why, I'd just love to.

07:51.888 --> 07:55.390
If only I didn't have every one
of them taken already.

07:55.641 --> 07:58.393
-You can't do that to us!
-We'll tell you a secret.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.769
A secret? Who by?

08:00.021 --> 08:01.646
You know Melanie Hamilton?

08:01.898 --> 08:04.316
Ashley Wilkes' cousin?
She's visiting--

08:04.525 --> 08:07.277
That goody-goody!
Who wants to know about her?

08:07.528 --> 08:09.029
Anyway, we heard-- They say--

08:09.280 --> 08:11.323
Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.

08:11.574 --> 08:15.160
-Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
STUART: Do we get those waltzes?

08:15.369 --> 08:16.828
Of course.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.997
[BOTH MEN CHEERING]

08:22.293 --> 08:25.212
-It can't be true! Ashley loves me!
STUART: Scarlett!

08:26.422 --> 08:29.716
-What's gotten into her?
-Suppose we made her mad?

08:29.967 --> 08:33.637
Where are you going without your
shawl and the night air coming?

08:33.888 --> 08:36.348
How come you didn't ask them
gentlemen to supper?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.808
You got no more manners
than a field hand.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.645
After me and Miss Ellen
done labored with you!

08:41.896 --> 08:45.273
Come on in before you catch
your death of dampness.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.527
No! I'm going to wait
for Pa to come home.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.445
Come on in here!

08:50.696 --> 08:52.280
Come on!

08:52.782 --> 08:54.449
Mm-mm-mm!

08:55.660 --> 08:57.494
[RINGING]

09:07.296 --> 09:08.630
FIELD HAND:
Quitting time!

09:08.881 --> 09:11.299
-Who says it's quitting time?
-I said.

09:11.551 --> 09:14.636
I's the foreman. I say
when it's quitting time at Tara.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.513
Quitting time!

09:16.931 --> 09:18.974
Quitting time!

09:59.849 --> 10:03.393
There's none in the county
can touch you, and none in the state.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.729
Pa!

10:05.938 --> 10:08.189
How proud of yourself you are!

10:10.276 --> 10:14.279
GERALD: Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,
so you've been spying on me.

10:14.530 --> 10:18.033
Like your sister, you'll tell
your mother that I was jumping again.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.410
You know I'm no tattletale
like Suellen.

10:20.661 --> 10:24.080
But after you broke your knee
last year jumping that fence--

10:24.332 --> 10:28.668
I'll not have me own daughter telling me
what I shall jump and not jump.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.337
It's my own neck, so it is.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.714
All right, Pa, you jump what you please.

10:32.965 --> 10:35.342
-How are they at Twelve Oaks?
-The Wilkeses?

10:35.551 --> 10:39.721
In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue
and talking nothing but war.

10:39.972 --> 10:43.016
Bother the war!
Was there anyone else there?

10:43.225 --> 10:45.935
Their cousin Melanie
and her brother, Charles.

10:46.187 --> 10:49.564
Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced,
mealy-mouthed ninny!

10:49.774 --> 10:51.191
Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.

10:51.442 --> 10:54.277
Ashley Wilkes couldn't like
anyone like her.

10:54.945 --> 10:57.822
What's your interest
in Ashley and Miss Melanie?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.659
Nothing. Let's go into the house.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.162
Has he been trifling with you?
Has he asked you to marry him?

11:04.330 --> 11:05.664
-No.
-Nor will he.

11:05.831 --> 11:08.458
I had it in strict confidence
from John Wilkes today...

11:08.668 --> 11:10.460
...Ashley's going to marry Melanie.

11:10.711 --> 11:13.254
It'll be announced
tomorrow night at the ball.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.756
I don't believe it!

11:15.508 --> 11:17.634
GERALD:
Here! Where are you off to?

11:17.843 --> 11:19.052
Scarlett!

11:19.387 --> 11:20.637
What are you about?

11:22.056 --> 11:25.975
Have you been running after a man
who's not in love with you?

11:26.185 --> 11:27.936
When you might have any other?

11:28.145 --> 11:31.606
I haven't been running after him,
it's just a surprise.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.359
Now, don't be jerking
your chin at me!

11:34.610 --> 11:37.904
If Ashley wanted to marry you,
I'd have misgivings.

11:38.155 --> 11:41.449
I want my girl to be happy.
You'd not be happy with him.

11:41.701 --> 11:42.909
I would! I would!

11:43.160 --> 11:47.330
What's the difference who you marry?
So long as he's a Southerner.

11:47.540 --> 11:50.125
And when I'm gone
I'll leave Tara to you.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.293
I don't want it.
It doesn't mean anything--

11:52.545 --> 11:54.796
Do you mean to tell me,
Katie Scarlett O'Hara...

11:55.047 --> 11:57.132
...that land doesn't mean
anything to you?

11:57.299 --> 11:59.801
Land is the only thing in the
world worth working for...

12:00.052 --> 12:01.886
...worth fighting for, worth dying for.

12:02.096 --> 12:05.432
-It's the only thing that lasts!
-You talk like an Irishman.

12:05.683 --> 12:09.561
It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
Don't you be forgetting...

12:09.729 --> 12:11.062
...that you're half Irish too.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.606
To anyone with a drop
of Irish blood in them...

12:13.774 --> 12:15.817
...the land they live on
is like their mother.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.111
But there now. You're just a child.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.447
It'll come to you,
this love of the land.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.533
There's no getting away from it
if you're Irish.

12:48.142 --> 12:49.309
MAMMY:
Here she comes!

12:49.477 --> 12:51.728
Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen,
your mama's home!

12:51.979 --> 12:54.814
Acting like a wet nurse to
them white-trash Slatterys...

12:55.024 --> 12:58.109
...instead of eating her supper.
Set up the fire!

12:58.360 --> 13:00.320
Got no business wearing herself out....

13:00.529 --> 13:02.864
Pork! Take the lamp
out on the porch.

13:03.115 --> 13:06.326
Wearing herself out.
Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home!

13:06.577 --> 13:08.578
Waiting on them poor white trash.

13:08.829 --> 13:10.705
Shut up, dog!
Barking in the house!

13:10.956 --> 13:13.374
Get up from there!
Don't you hear Miss Ellen?

13:13.626 --> 13:15.919
Get out there and get
her medicine chest!

13:16.295 --> 13:18.505
PORK:
We was worried about you, Miss Ellen.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.090
It's all right, Pork. I'm home.

13:21.592 --> 13:25.261
WILKERSON: Mrs. O'Hara, we finished
plowing the creek bottom today.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.972
What do you want me
to start on tomorrow?

13:28.182 --> 13:31.768
Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come
from Emmie Slattery's bedside.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.436
Your child has been born.

13:33.687 --> 13:36.856
My child, ma'am?
I'm sure I don't understand.

13:37.107 --> 13:40.109
Has been born and
mercifully has died.

13:40.361 --> 13:42.362
Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.

13:45.282 --> 13:47.617
MAMMY: I fix your supper myself
and you eats it.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.495
-Yes, after prayers, Mammy.
-Yes'm.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.666
Mr. O'Hara, you must
dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.

13:54.917 --> 13:58.461
Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?
He's the best overseer in the county.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.339
He must go tomorrow morning,
the first thing!

14:03.259 --> 14:04.759
-No.
-Yes.

14:05.553 --> 14:08.263
The Yankee Wilkerson and
the white-trash Slattery girl?

14:08.514 --> 14:11.933
-We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
-Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.520
SUELLEN: Scarlett's dress
is prettier than mine!

14:15.938 --> 14:18.898
Can't she wear my pink dress?
I wanna wear Scarlett's green dress.

14:19.149 --> 14:22.235
I don't like your tone, Suellen.
Your pink gown's lovely.

14:22.486 --> 14:25.363
CARREEN: Can't I stay up for the ball?
-You may wear my garnets.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.241
CARREEN: Why can't I stay up for
the ball tomorrow?

14:28.492 --> 14:33.454
Scarlett. You look tired, my dear.
I'm worried about you.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.123
I'm all right, Mother.

14:35.332 --> 14:38.668
Why can't I stay up for the ball?
I'm 13 now.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.212
You may go to the barbecue.

14:41.463 --> 14:43.673
I didn't want your tacky dress anyhow!

14:43.924 --> 14:46.593
-Hush up!
ELLEN: Prayers, girls.

14:53.017 --> 14:57.896
--and to all the saints, that I have
sinned in thought, word and deed...

14:58.147 --> 15:03.109
...through my fault, through my fault,
through my most grievous fault.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.613
Therefore, I beseech thee,
blessed Mary, ever virgin...

15:06.822 --> 15:09.032
...blessed Michael the Archangel...

15:09.283 --> 15:11.034
...blessed John the Baptist...

15:11.285 --> 15:15.496
...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul,
and all the saints...

15:15.748 --> 15:17.081
...pray to the Lord....

15:17.291 --> 15:19.542
[WHISPERING]
Ashley doesn't know I love him.

15:20.544 --> 15:22.420
I'll tell him that I love him...

15:22.630 --> 15:24.964
...and then he can't marry.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.301
Hear thee Almighty,
most merciful Lord...

15:28.510 --> 15:32.972
...grant us pardon, absolution
and remission of our sins. Amen.

15:33.933 --> 15:35.058
Ooh!

15:35.267 --> 15:38.519
Just hold on and suck in!

15:38.729 --> 15:41.022
Mammy, here's
Miss Scarlett's vittles.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.775
Take it back to the kitchen.
I won't eat a bite.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.360
Yes'm, you is!

15:45.611 --> 15:47.528
You's gonna eat every mouthful.

15:48.197 --> 15:51.449
No, I'm not!

15:53.452 --> 15:55.411
Put on the dress.
We're late already.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.330
-What my lamb gonna wear?
-That.

15:57.581 --> 16:01.459
No, you ain't! You can't show
your bosom before 3:00!

16:01.835 --> 16:03.586
I'm gonna speak to your ma!

16:03.837 --> 16:06.923
If you say one word to mother,
I won't eat a bite.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.719
Well....

16:18.727 --> 16:22.188
Keep your shawl on. I ain't
aiming for you to get freckled...

16:22.398 --> 16:26.901
...after the buttermilk I done put
on you, bleaching them freckles.

16:32.950 --> 16:37.745
Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on
and be good and eat just a little, honey.

16:37.955 --> 16:41.791
No! I'm going to have a good time
today and eat at the barbecue.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.794
If you don't care
what folks says, I does!

16:45.004 --> 16:50.133
You can always tell a lady by how
she eats in front of folks like a bird.

16:50.426 --> 16:54.637
I ain't aiming for you to go to
John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!

16:54.847 --> 16:56.347
Fiddle-dee-dee!

16:56.598 --> 16:59.892
Ashley told me he likes
girls with a healthy appetite.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.812
MAMMY: What gentlemens says
and thinks is different things.

17:03.063 --> 17:06.024
And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley
asking for to marry you.

17:22.166 --> 17:26.753
Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need
a having it come right back up again.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.591
Why is it a girl has to be
so silly to catch a husband?

17:31.842 --> 17:35.720
GERALD: Scarlett O'Hara! If you're not
down here by the time I count 10...

17:35.929 --> 17:38.056
-...we'll go without you!
-I'm coming, Pa!

17:38.307 --> 17:43.436
GERALD:
One, two, three, four, five....

17:44.938 --> 17:46.147
Oh, dear!

17:46.356 --> 17:50.735
My stays are so tight, I'll never
get through the day without belching!

18:14.885 --> 18:16.427
GERALD:
Well, John Wilkes.

18:16.678 --> 18:19.931
-It's a grand day for the barbecue.
-So it seems, Gerald.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.808
Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?

18:22.059 --> 18:25.603
She's settling accounts with the overseer,
but she'll be along tonight.

18:25.813 --> 18:29.482
-Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
-Thank you kindly, India.

18:29.691 --> 18:32.819
Your daughter's getting
prettier every day, John.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.905
Here are the O'Hara girls.
We must greet them.

18:36.156 --> 18:39.367
I can't stand Scarlett.
She throws herself at Ashley.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.244
That's your brother's business.

18:41.453 --> 18:43.913
You must remember
your duties as hostess.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.666
Good morning, girls.
You're looking lovely.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.709
Good morning, Scarlett.

18:49.336 --> 18:52.046
India Wilkes,
what a lovely dress!

18:52.256 --> 18:54.966
I just can't take my eyes off it.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.468
Good morning, Miss Scarlett.

18:58.178 --> 19:01.222
You look mighty fine
this morning, Miss Scarlett.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.601
It's a pleasure to see you,
Miss Scarlett.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.564
Ashley!

19:11.441 --> 19:14.152
Scarlett, my dear!

19:14.653 --> 19:16.654
I've been looking for you everywhere.

19:16.864 --> 19:20.616
I've got something I must tell you.
Can't we go someplace quiet?

19:20.826 --> 19:24.412
Yes, I'd like to, but I have
something to tell you too.

19:24.663 --> 19:28.249
Something I hope
you'll be glad to hear.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.626
Come say hello
to my cousin Melanie first.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.503
Oh, do we have to?

19:32.754 --> 19:36.507
She's been looking forward
to seeing you again. Melanie!

19:37.968 --> 19:41.429
ASHLEY: Here's Scarlett.
-Scarlett!

19:42.472 --> 19:44.015
I'm so glad to see you again.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.934
Melanie, what a surprise
to run into you here.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.395
I hope you'll stay with us a few days.

19:49.646 --> 19:53.107
I hope I shall stay long enough
for us to become real friends.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.110
-I do want us to be.
-We'll keep her here, won't we?

19:56.570 --> 19:59.030
We'll make the biggest fuss over her!

19:59.281 --> 20:02.033
If anybody can give a girl
a good time, it's Ashley.

20:02.284 --> 20:05.536
Our good times must seem silly
to you. You're so serious.

20:05.829 --> 20:08.497
Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.

20:08.707 --> 20:11.834
I've always admired you.
I wish I could be more like you.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.879
You mustn't flatter me
and say things you don't mean.

20:15.130 --> 20:18.674
Nobody could accuse Melanie
of being insincere. Could they, my dear?

20:18.884 --> 20:20.927
She's not like you, is she, Ashley?

20:21.136 --> 20:23.429
He never means a word
he says to any girl.

20:24.139 --> 20:27.391
Why, Charles Hamilton,
you handsome old thing, you!

20:27.643 --> 20:29.060
But, Miss O'Hara, I--

20:29.311 --> 20:34.148
Was it kind to bring your good-looking
brother here to break my poor heart?

20:34.399 --> 20:38.653
Now that Charles is your beau,
she's after him like a hornet.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.197
Charles, I want to eat
barbecue with you.

20:41.448 --> 20:45.034
Don't go philandering with any other girl,
because I'm mighty jealous.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.621
I won't, Miss O'Hara.
I couldn't!

20:48.872 --> 20:52.917
I do declare, Frank Kennedy! You look
dashing with those new whiskers.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.544
Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.

20:56.004 --> 21:01.092
Charles and Wade asked me to eat with
them, but I told them I promised you.

21:01.343 --> 21:05.137
You needn't be so amused.
She's after your beau now.

21:05.389 --> 21:08.307
That's mighty flattering of you,
Miss Scarlett.

21:08.558 --> 21:10.559
I'll see what I can do.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.312
Why's your sister mad?
You sparking her beau?

21:13.522 --> 21:16.399
As if I couldn't do better
than that old maid in britches.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.026
SCARLETT: Brent and Stuart,
you handsome old things!

21:19.278 --> 21:22.446
-I didn't mean it. I'm mad at you!
-What have we done?

21:22.698 --> 21:26.242
You haven't been near me all day!
I wore this old dress for you.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.286
I was counting on eating with you.

21:28.537 --> 21:31.205
-You are, Scarlett.
-Of course you are, honey.

21:31.415 --> 21:34.959
I never can make up my mind
which of you is the handsomest.

21:35.210 --> 21:38.587
I was awake all last night
trying to figure it out.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.381
Oh, shucks!

21:43.927 --> 21:46.595
-Cathleen, who's that?
-Who?

21:46.805 --> 21:48.973
That man looking at us and smiling.

21:49.224 --> 21:50.349
The nasty dark one.

21:50.600 --> 21:54.520
Don't you know? That's Rhett Butler.
He's from Charleston.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.273
He has a most terrible reputation.

22:01.653 --> 22:05.614
He looks as if he knows
what I look like without my shimmy.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.367
My dear, he isn't received.

22:08.618 --> 22:12.496
He spends his time up North
because his folks won't speak to him.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.999
He was expelled
from West Point, he's so fast.

22:15.208 --> 22:18.252
And there's that business
about the girl he wouldn't marry.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.587
Tell, tell!

22:19.796 --> 22:24.842
He took her out buggy-riding in
the late afternoon without a chaperon...

22:25.385 --> 22:28.137
...and then he refused to marry her!

22:30.640 --> 22:34.185
No, but she was ruined just the same.

22:38.940 --> 22:40.358
Ashley....

22:40.567 --> 22:43.569
-Happy?
-So happy.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.697
ASHLEY:
You seem to belong here...

22:46.990 --> 22:49.617
...as if it had all been
imagined for you.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.245
I like to feel that I belong
to the things you love.

22:53.455 --> 22:56.374
-You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
-Yes, Ashley.

22:56.583 --> 23:00.252
I love it as more than a house.

23:00.462 --> 23:04.215
It's a whole world that wants only
to be graceful and beautiful.

23:04.466 --> 23:08.302
It's so unaware
that it may not last forever.

23:08.553 --> 23:11.722
You're afraid of what may happen
if the war comes?

23:11.932 --> 23:14.892
But we don't have to be afraid for us.

23:15.102 --> 23:18.396
No war can come into our world, Ashley.

23:18.647 --> 23:21.732
Whatever comes, I'll love you...

23:21.983 --> 23:26.112
...just as I do now, until I die.

23:30.117 --> 23:31.951
Isn’t this better than a table?

23:32.202 --> 23:35.079
A girl hasn't got but two sides
to her at a table.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.998
-I'll get her dessert.
-She said me!

23:38.208 --> 23:39.458
Allow me, Miss O'Hara?

23:41.837 --> 23:43.838
I think....

23:44.005 --> 23:45.798
Hmm....

23:46.299 --> 23:48.843
I think Charles Hamilton may get it.

23:50.804 --> 23:54.140
Thank you, Miss O'Hara.
Thank you!

23:54.349 --> 23:57.393
STUART: Go get it, boy!
Isn’t he the luckiest....

24:05.110 --> 24:06.777
Miss O'Hara...

24:07.696 --> 24:09.280
...I love you.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.033
I don't guess I'm as hungry
as I thought.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.914
Why do I have to take a nap?
I'm not tired.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.375
Well-brought-up ladies
takes naps at parties.

24:21.585 --> 24:25.254
It's time you behave and act
like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.

24:25.505 --> 24:29.425
When we were in Saratoga,
I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps.

24:29.634 --> 24:32.887
And you won't see no Yankee
girls at the ball, neither.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.555
How was Ashley today?

24:34.806 --> 24:37.266
He didn't pay much attention to you.

24:37.517 --> 24:38.976
You mind your own business!

24:39.227 --> 24:41.604
You'll be lucky you don't lose
whisker-face Kennedy.

24:41.813 --> 24:45.357
You're sweet on Ashley, and his
engagement's being announced tonight.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.443
That's as much as you know.

24:47.861 --> 24:52.281
You ought to behave yourself!
Acting like poor white-trash children!

24:52.491 --> 24:55.326
If you's old enough for parties,
you should act like ladies!

24:55.535 --> 24:57.119
Who cares?

25:48.129 --> 25:50.464
GERALD: We've borne enough insults
from the Yankees.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.802
We'll keep our slaves
with or without their approval.

25:55.053 --> 25:58.597
'Twas the sovereign right of
Georgia to secede from the Union.

25:58.807 --> 26:01.600
The South must assert herself
by force of arms.

26:01.851 --> 26:05.980
After we've fired on the Yankee rascals
at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.399
-There's no other way.
MAN 1: That's right!

26:08.650 --> 26:10.526
MAN 1:
Let the Yankees ask for peace.

26:10.777 --> 26:15.114
The situation's very simple.
The Yankees can't fight and we can.

26:15.323 --> 26:17.992
There won't be a battle.
They'll turn and run.

26:18.243 --> 26:22.079
BRENT: One of us can lick 20 Yanks.
STUART: We'll beat them in one battle.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.665
Gentlemen can always fight
better than rabble.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.208
Gentlemen always fight better.

26:26.459 --> 26:28.794
GERALD: What does the captain
of our Troop say?

26:29.045 --> 26:33.215
Well, gentlemen,
if Georgia fights, I go with her.

26:33.466 --> 26:36.510
I hope the Yankees let us
leave the Union in peace.

26:36.678 --> 26:38.220
BRENT:
Ashley, they've insulted us!

26:38.471 --> 26:40.306
STUART:
You can't mean you don't want war?

26:40.473 --> 26:43.684
Most of the miseries of the world
were caused by wars.

26:43.893 --> 26:48.814
And when the wars were over,
no one ever knew what they were about.

26:50.108 --> 26:53.527
Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's
been up North, I hear.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.154
Don't you agree with us?

26:56.364 --> 26:58.866
I think it's hard winning
a war with words.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.326
What do you mean, sir?

27:00.577 --> 27:03.078
There's not a cannon factory
in the whole South.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.289
What difference does that make
to a gentleman?

27:05.540 --> 27:08.459
It'll make a great difference
to a great many gentlemen, sir.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.420
Are you hinting
that the Yankees can lick us?

27:11.671 --> 27:12.796
No, I'm not hinting.

27:13.048 --> 27:15.758
I'm saying plainly, the Yankees
are better equipped than we.

27:16.009 --> 27:18.177
They've got factories,
shipyards, coal mines...

27:18.386 --> 27:21.138
...and a fleet to bottle up
our harbors and starve us.

27:21.389 --> 27:24.933
All we've got is cotton and slaves,
and arrogance.

27:25.185 --> 27:27.853
I refuse to listen
to any renegade talk!

27:28.438 --> 27:32.399
-I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
-Apologies aren't enough, sir.

27:32.567 --> 27:35.235
I hear you were turned out
of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.072
And you aren't received in
any family in Charleston.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.490
Not even your own!

27:44.454 --> 27:47.623
I apologize again
for all my shortcomings.

27:48.917 --> 27:51.585
Perhaps you won't mind if
I look over your place?

27:51.795 --> 27:55.172
I seem to be spoiling everybody's
brandy and cigars...

27:55.423 --> 27:57.174
...and dreams of victory.

28:03.890 --> 28:07.351
CHARLES: That's what you can expect
from somebody like Rhett Butler.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.311
GERALD:
You did everything but call him out.

28:09.562 --> 28:11.814
-He refused to fight.
-Not quite there, Charles.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.733
-He refused to take advantage of you.
-Take advantage of me?

28:14.901 --> 28:18.028
He's one of the best shots in the country,
as he's proved many times.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.906
-He's got steadier hands than yours.
-Well, I'll show him!

28:21.074 --> 28:23.617
Please. Don't go tweaking
his nose anymore.

28:23.910 --> 28:26.829
You may be needed for more
important fighting.

28:27.038 --> 28:29.331
If you'll excuse me,
Mr. Butler's our guest.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.834
I think I'll just show him around.

Who are you hiding from in here?

29:05.410 --> 29:07.077
What are you up to?

29:09.247 --> 29:12.499
Why aren't you upstairs,
resting with the other girls?

29:13.418 --> 29:15.294
What is this, Scarlett, a secret?

29:15.962 --> 29:17.296
Oh, Ashley....

Ashley!

29:18.923 --> 29:21.300
-I love you.
-Scarlett!

29:21.551 --> 29:23.761
I love you, I do!

29:25.138 --> 29:28.807
Isn’t it enough that you gathered
every other man's heart today?

29:29.017 --> 29:31.351
You've always had mine.
You cut your teeth on it.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.978
Don't tease me now.

29:33.229 --> 29:36.064
Have I your heart, my darling?
I love you, I love you!

29:36.316 --> 29:38.150
You mustn't say such things.

29:38.401 --> 29:40.027
You'll hate me for hearing them.

29:40.236 --> 29:43.906
I could never hate you,
and I know you must care about me.

29:44.491 --> 29:46.909
You do care, don't you?

29:47.786 --> 29:50.204
Yes, I care.

29:52.123 --> 29:55.459
Can't we go away
and forget we ever said these things?

29:56.836 --> 29:58.587
SCARLETT:
But how can we do that?

29:58.755 --> 30:01.006
Don't you--?
Don't you want to marry me?

30:01.174 --> 30:02.716
I'm going to marry Melanie.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.260
But you can't!
Not if you care for me!

30:05.512 --> 30:08.806
Oh, my dear, why must you make me
say things that will hurt you?

30:09.474 --> 30:11.725
How can I make you understand?

30:12.227 --> 30:15.103
You're so young, you don't
know what marriage means.

30:15.313 --> 30:17.689
I know I love you,
and I want to be your wife.

30:17.941 --> 30:19.358
You don't love Melanie.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.151
She's like me, Scarlett.

30:21.402 --> 30:23.821
She's my blood
and we understand each other.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.323
But you love me!

30:26.533 --> 30:28.408
How could I help loving you?

30:28.618 --> 30:30.911
You have all the passion
for life that I lack.

30:31.412 --> 30:35.624
That kind of love isn't enough
for two people as different as we are.

30:35.875 --> 30:38.877
Why not say it, you coward?
You're afraid to marry me.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.380
You'd marry that fool
who can only say...

30:41.589 --> 30:44.967
..."yes," "no" and raise
a passel of mealy-mouthed brats!

30:45.218 --> 30:46.343
You mustn't say that!

30:46.594 --> 30:49.346
Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
You led me on!

30:49.556 --> 30:52.599
-You made me believe you'd marry me.
-Scarlett, be fair!

30:52.809 --> 30:55.394
-I never at any time--
-You did! It's true, you did!

30:55.603 --> 30:57.437
I'll hate you till I die!

30:57.689 --> 31:01.358
I can't think of anything
bad enough to call you!

[WHISTLES]

31:28.177 --> 31:29.303
Has the war started?

31:30.430 --> 31:33.974

your presence known.

31:34.309 --> 31:36.518

beautiful love scene?

31:36.728 --> 31:38.812

would it?

But don't worry.
Your secret is safe with me.

31:42.025 --> 31:45.777
-Sir, you are no gentleman.
-And you, miss, are no lady.

31:45.987 --> 31:49.573
I don't hold that against you.
Ladies never held any charm for me.

31:49.824 --> 31:52.534
First you take advantage of me,
then you insult me!

31:52.785 --> 31:54.369
I meant it as a compliment.

I hope to see more of you, when
you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.

enough for a girl of your--

of herself running after all the men.

That's not fair, India.

INDIA:
Melanie, you're just too good to be true.

32:26.069 --> 32:29.696
-Didn't you see her going after Charles?
-And she knows Charles belongs to me.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.406
You're wrong, India.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.743

I couldn't hope that you could love me.

I'm so clumsy and stupid
and not nearly good enough for you.

But if you could think of marrying me,
I'd do anything in the world for you.

Just anything, I promise.

Miss O'Hara, I said,
"Would you marry me?"

Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.

-I don't think I'd want to wait.
-You'll marry me before I go?

Oh, Miss O'Hara! Scarlett.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.929
-When may I speak to your father?
-The sooner the better.

34:18.139 --> 34:22.517
I'll go now, I can't wait.
Will you excuse me, dear?

Oh, Ashley.

at our wedding yesterday...

would be as beautiful.

scaring people in that thing.

But I just can't bear
going around in black.

It's bad enough not being able to
go to parties. But looking this way too?

37:02.094 --> 37:03.762
I don't think you're at all horrible.

37:04.013 --> 37:08.350
It's only natural you want to look young
and be young when you are young.

CARPETBAGGER 2:
Jump, you gray-backed beggars!

1:58:47.203 --> 1:58:49.371
Acts like they won the war.

1:58:49.831 --> 1:58:52.332
You come on, give me
them pants, Mr. Kennedy.

1:58:52.542 --> 1:58:53.792
Come on!

1:58:55.920 --> 1:58:59.381
Scrub yourself with that lye soap,
'fore I scrub you myself.

1:58:59.632 --> 1:59:02.717
I'm gonna put these britches
in the boiling pot.

1:59:05.513 --> 1:59:07.639
The whole army's
got the same troubles...

1:59:07.890 --> 1:59:10.517
...crawling clothes and dysentery.

1:59:10.726 --> 1:59:12.644
It's humiliating how
you're treating him.

1:59:12.937 --> 1:59:16.690
You'd be a sight more humiliated
if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you.

1:59:18.359 --> 1:59:20.026
MELANIE:
Oh, come on, Beau!

1:59:20.236 --> 1:59:24.447
We must leave this gentleman alone
because he's tired and he's hungry.

1:59:24.699 --> 1:59:27.534
I don't mind, ma'am.
Good to see a youngster again.

1:59:27.743 --> 1:59:28.994
Nice little fella.

1:59:29.203 --> 1:59:32.497
Another two years, and we could've
had him in Cobb's Legion.

1:59:33.666 --> 1:59:36.501
-Were you in Cobb's Legion?
SOLDIER: Yes, ma'am.

1:59:36.752 --> 1:59:40.213
Why, then, you must know
my husband, Major Wilkes?

1:59:40.381 --> 1:59:44.009
Oh, yes, ma'am. He was captured
at Spotsylvania, I think.

1:59:44.260 --> 1:59:48.221
Captured? Oh, thank heaven!
Then he isn't--

1:59:48.472 --> 1:59:51.683
-My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison.
SCARLETT: Melanie?

1:59:52.602 --> 1:59:55.437
Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.
Come along, Beau.

1:59:55.605 --> 1:59:58.023
I'll watch out for him.
We're good friends.

1:59:58.274 --> 1:59:59.858
Thank you.

2:00:03.905 --> 2:00:07.115
I slave day and night
just so we can have enough food...

2:00:07.366 --> 2:00:09.618
...and you give it away
to scarecrows.

2:00:09.911 --> 2:00:13.622
-I'd sooner have a plague of locusts.
-Don't scold me, Scarlett.

2:00:13.789 --> 2:00:16.499
I've just heard that Ashley
was taken prisoner.

2:00:16.709 --> 2:00:18.210
-Ashley a prisoner?
-Yes.

2:00:18.461 --> 2:00:22.797
And maybe if he's alive and well,
he's on some Northern road right now.

2:00:23.049 --> 2:00:26.134
Maybe a Northern woman
is giving him some of her dinner...

2:00:26.302 --> 2:00:29.888
...and helping my beloved
to come back home to me.

2:00:31.307 --> 2:00:34.100
-I hope so, Melly.
FRANK: Miss Scarlett?

2:00:37.438 --> 2:00:41.816
I want to take up something
with your Pa, but he doesn't seem to--

2:00:42.068 --> 2:00:44.611
Perhaps I can help you.
I'm head of the house now.

2:00:44.779 --> 2:00:46.821
Well, I-- I....

2:00:47.031 --> 2:00:49.908
Miss Scarlett, I was aiming
to ask for Suellen.

2:00:50.826 --> 2:00:55.080
Are you telling me you haven't asked
for her after all these years?

2:00:56.165 --> 2:00:58.959
The truth is, I'm so much
older than she is...

2:00:59.168 --> 2:01:01.169
...and now I haven't
a cent to my name.

2:01:01.462 --> 2:01:03.046
Who has, nowadays?

2:01:03.297 --> 2:01:06.007
Miss Scarlett, if true love
carries any weight with you...

2:01:06.259 --> 2:01:09.010
...you can be sure your sister
will be rich in that.

2:01:09.262 --> 2:01:12.430
I'd go and get myself a little business,
if we're engaged.

2:01:12.682 --> 2:01:14.975
-As soon as I'm on my feet again--
-All right, Frank.

2:01:15.184 --> 2:01:18.687
I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
You go ask her now.

2:01:19.146 --> 2:01:22.190
Thank you.
Thank you, Miss Scarlett.

2:01:24.610 --> 2:01:27.445
Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes.
Excuse me.

2:01:29.323 --> 2:01:32.200
What seems to be
the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?

2:01:32.451 --> 2:01:36.204
More trouble than he guesses.
He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.

2:01:36.372 --> 2:01:37.872
Oh, I'm so glad.

2:01:38.207 --> 2:01:42.544
It's a pity he can't marry her now.
It'd be one less mouth to feed.

2:01:46.215 --> 2:01:48.133
Oh, another one!

2:01:48.384 --> 2:01:50.677
-Hope this one isn't hungry.
-He'll be hungry.

2:01:50.886 --> 2:01:53.388
I'll tell Prissy to get
an extra plate--

2:02:05.151 --> 2:02:06.359
Ashley!

2:02:08.738 --> 2:02:10.071
Ashley!

2:02:22.877 --> 2:02:23.918
Miss Scarlett!

2:02:24.211 --> 2:02:25.337
Don't spoil it.

2:02:25.588 --> 2:02:28.423
Turn me loose, you fool.
Turn me loose! It's Ashley!

2:02:28.674 --> 2:02:30.717
He's her husband, ain't he?

2:02:43.105 --> 2:02:44.939
-Miss Scarlett?
-High time you got back.

2:02:45.191 --> 2:02:48.193
-Did you get the horse shod?
-Yes'm, he's shod.

2:02:48.402 --> 2:02:50.779
Fine thing, horses
get shoes and humans can't.

2:02:51.030 --> 2:02:52.655
Here, stir this soap.

2:02:52.907 --> 2:02:54.074
Miss Scarlett, ma'am?

2:02:54.283 --> 2:02:57.535
I gotta know how much money
have you got left. In gold.

2:02:57.745 --> 2:02:59.746
Ten dollars. Why?

2:03:00.539 --> 2:03:01.748
That won't be enough.

2:03:01.957 --> 2:03:03.708
What are you talking about?

2:03:03.959 --> 2:03:08.171
Well, I see'd that old no-count
white-trash Wilkerson...

2:03:08.422 --> 2:03:10.965
...that used to be
Mr. Gerald's overseer here.

2:03:11.217 --> 2:03:14.719
He's a regular Yankee now,
and he was making a brag...

2:03:14.929 --> 2:03:19.933
...that his Carpetbagger friends run
the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.

2:03:20.184 --> 2:03:24.729
-How much more we got to pay?
-I hear the taxman say $300.

2:03:24.939 --> 2:03:26.398
Three hundred--!

2:03:27.441 --> 2:03:31.820
It might just as well be 3 million.
But we gotta raise it, that's all.

2:03:32.071 --> 2:03:34.739
Yes'm. How?

2:03:36.700 --> 2:03:40.161
-I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
-He ain't got no $300.

2:03:40.329 --> 2:03:43.081
Well, I can ask him
if I want to, can't I?

2:03:45.251 --> 2:03:47.168
Asking ain't getting.

2:03:56.178 --> 2:03:57.720
Ashley....

2:03:58.722 --> 2:04:01.850
They say Abe Lincoln
got his start splitting rails.

2:04:02.101 --> 2:04:05.019
Just think what heights I may
climb to, once I get the knack.

2:04:05.229 --> 2:04:09.524
Ashley, the Yankees
want $300 more in taxes.

2:04:10.359 --> 2:04:12.277
What shall we do?

2:04:12.528 --> 2:04:14.988
Ashley, what's to become of us?

2:04:15.197 --> 2:04:18.741
What becomes of people
when their civilization breaks up?

2:04:18.951 --> 2:04:21.661
Those with brains and courage
come through all right.

2:04:21.871 --> 2:04:23.538
Those that haven't are winnowed out.

2:04:23.789 --> 2:04:25.039
For heaven's sake...

2:04:25.291 --> 2:04:28.751
...don't talk nonsense
when it's us being winnowed out!

2:04:29.003 --> 2:04:33.548
You're right, Scarlett. Here I am
talking tommyrot about civilization...

2:04:33.799 --> 2:04:35.884
...while your Tara is in danger.

2:04:36.135 --> 2:04:38.970
You've come to me for help,
and I've none to give.

2:04:39.805 --> 2:04:43.141
Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.

2:04:43.517 --> 2:04:45.643
You, Ashley? A coward?

2:04:46.228 --> 2:04:47.770
What are you afraid of?

2:04:48.647 --> 2:04:52.525
Mostly of life becoming
too real for me, I suppose.

2:04:52.735 --> 2:04:55.278
Not that I mind splitting rails.

2:04:55.654 --> 2:05:00.408
But I do mind very much losing
the beauty of that life I loved.

2:05:01.994 --> 2:05:07.081
If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent
my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.

2:05:07.374 --> 2:05:08.583
But the war did come.

2:05:09.210 --> 2:05:11.753
I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.

2:05:12.004 --> 2:05:15.089
I saw men crumple up in agony
when I shot them.

2:05:15.925 --> 2:05:20.512
And now I find myself in a world
which for me is worse than death.

2:05:20.763 --> 2:05:22.931
A world in which there's
no place for me.

2:05:25.100 --> 2:05:28.811
I can't make you understand.
You don't know the meaning of fear.

2:05:29.021 --> 2:05:31.731
You never mind facing realities.

2:05:32.441 --> 2:05:34.943
You never want to escape
from them as I do.

2:05:37.613 --> 2:05:39.239
Escape?

2:05:40.324 --> 2:05:44.452
Ashley, you're wrong.
I do want to escape too.

2:05:44.745 --> 2:05:49.457
I'm so very tired of it all.
I've struggled for food and for money.

2:05:49.625 --> 2:05:53.211
I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton
till I can't stand it.

2:05:53.462 --> 2:05:55.755
I tell you, the South is dead.
It's dead!

2:05:55.965 --> 2:05:59.884
The Yankees and Carpetbaggers
have it and left nothing for us.

2:06:02.137 --> 2:06:03.596
Oh, Ashley....

2:06:04.265 --> 2:06:07.100
Let's run away.
We'd go to Mexico.

2:06:07.351 --> 2:06:10.311
They want officers in the Mexican army.
We'd be happy.

2:06:10.479 --> 2:06:12.605
I'd work for you.
I'd do anything for you!

2:06:12.815 --> 2:06:16.276
You don't love Melanie. You said
you loved me at Twelve Oaks.

2:06:16.485 --> 2:06:18.653
And anyway, Melanie can't--

2:06:19.280 --> 2:06:22.657
Dr. Meade said she can't have
more children. I could give you--

2:06:22.908 --> 2:06:24.492
Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks?

2:06:24.785 --> 2:06:26.995
You think I could ever forget?
Have you?

2:06:27.288 --> 2:06:30.331
Can you honestly say
you don't love me?

2:06:31.000 --> 2:06:33.418
-No, I don't love you.
-It's a lie!

2:06:33.627 --> 2:06:36.588
Even so, do you think
I'd leave Melanie and the baby?

2:06:36.797 --> 2:06:39.507
You couldn't leave
your father and the girls.

2:06:39.800 --> 2:06:42.093
I'm sick of them.
I'm tired of them!

2:06:42.303 --> 2:06:45.972
Yes, you're sick and tired.
That's why you're talking this way.

2:06:47.182 --> 2:06:49.267
You've carried the load
for all of us.

2:06:49.476 --> 2:06:52.520
From now on, I'll be more help
to you. I promise.

2:06:52.688 --> 2:06:54.689
There's only one way you can help me.

2:06:54.982 --> 2:06:59.110
Take me away.
There's nothing to keep us here.

2:06:59.987 --> 2:07:01.404
Nothing?

2:07:02.906 --> 2:07:05.158
Nothing except honor.

2:07:17.713 --> 2:07:21.466
Please, Scarlett.
Please, dear. You mustn't cry.

2:07:21.717 --> 2:07:26.429
You mustn't. Please,
my brave dear, you mustn't.

2:07:38.525 --> 2:07:41.235
SCARLETT:
You do love me! You do love me!

2:07:41.445 --> 2:07:43.738
-No, don't, don't.
-You love me.

2:07:44.031 --> 2:07:46.199
We won't do this.
I tell you, we won't do it!

2:07:46.408 --> 2:07:49.202
It won't happen again.
I'll take Melanie and go.

2:07:49.453 --> 2:07:52.080
-Say it. You love me.
-All right, I'll say it.

2:07:52.331 --> 2:07:56.417
I love your courage and stubbornness
so much that I could forget...

2:07:56.585 --> 2:08:01.255
...the best wife a man ever had.
But I'm not going to forget her!

2:08:10.432 --> 2:08:12.934
Then there's nothing left for me.

2:08:13.936 --> 2:08:16.062
Nothing to fight for.

2:08:16.772 --> 2:08:18.981
Nothing to live for.

2:08:21.360 --> 2:08:23.569
Yes, there is something.

2:08:24.238 --> 2:08:26.864
Something you love better than me...

2:08:27.074 --> 2:08:28.991
...though you may not know it.

2:08:34.998 --> 2:08:36.499
Tara.

2:08:39.878 --> 2:08:41.212
Yes.

2:08:43.132 --> 2:08:45.258
I still have this.

2:08:49.888 --> 2:08:51.514
You needn't go.

2:08:52.099 --> 2:08:56.310
I won't have you all starve, simply
because I threw myself at your head.

2:08:56.979 --> 2:08:59.230
It won't happen again.

2:09:26.842 --> 2:09:28.009
SCARLETT:
It's Emmie Slattery.

2:09:28.177 --> 2:09:29.469
-Yes'm, it's me.
SCARLETT: Stop!

2:09:30.679 --> 2:09:33.639
You haven't forgotten
your old overseer, have you?

2:09:34.349 --> 2:09:36.350
Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now.

2:09:36.602 --> 2:09:39.187
Get off those steps, you wench!
Get off this land!

2:09:39.646 --> 2:09:41.355
You can't speak that way to my wife.

2:09:41.607 --> 2:09:43.649
Wife? High time
you made her your wife.

2:09:43.859 --> 2:09:46.277
Who baptized your brats
after you killed my mother?

2:09:46.779 --> 2:09:48.488
We came out here to pay a call.

2:09:48.697 --> 2:09:51.699
A friendly call, and talk business
with old friends.

2:09:51.950 --> 2:09:54.368
Friends? When were we ever friends?

2:09:54.661 --> 2:09:57.705
Still high and mighty, ain't you?
Well, I know all about you.

2:09:57.956 --> 2:09:59.332
Your father's turned idiot.

2:09:59.583 --> 2:10:03.461
You can't pay your taxes, and I come
to offer to buy the place from you.

2:10:03.670 --> 2:10:07.089
To make you a right good offer.
Emmie wants to live here.

2:10:07.341 --> 2:10:09.300
Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!

2:10:09.551 --> 2:10:14.138
WILKERSON: You'll see who's running
things when you're sold out for taxes.

2:10:14.389 --> 2:10:16.682
I'll buy this place
and I'll live in it!

2:10:17.100 --> 2:10:19.519
But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.

2:10:19.728 --> 2:10:22.230
SCARLETT:
That's all of Tara you'll ever get!

2:10:23.357 --> 2:10:25.358
You'll be sorry for that.

2:10:33.909 --> 2:10:35.243
WILKERSON:
We'll be back!

2:10:35.494 --> 2:10:38.079
I'll show you who
the owner of Tara is!

2:10:43.377 --> 2:10:44.919
SCARLETT:
Pa, come back!

2:10:47.923 --> 2:10:49.757
Pa, come back!

2:10:51.885 --> 2:10:53.386
Yankee coward!

2:11:01.270 --> 2:11:02.353
SCARLETT:
Pa!

2:11:22.708 --> 2:11:25.877
PORK: Lordy, Miss Scarlett,
that's Mr. Gerald's watch!

2:11:26.128 --> 2:11:29.088
SCARLETT: You take it. It's for you.
Pa'd want you to have it.

2:11:29.298 --> 2:11:32.550
You ain't got no business
parting from this watch now.

2:11:32.801 --> 2:11:36.095
You needs all your valuables
to sell for that tax money.

2:11:36.305 --> 2:11:38.973
Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?

2:11:39.975 --> 2:11:41.976
And don't cry.

2:11:42.185 --> 2:11:44.812
I can stand everybody's
tears but yours.

2:11:48.734 --> 2:11:51.068
Oh, Mammy, Mammy!

2:11:56.325 --> 2:12:00.703
You've been brave so long.
You just gotta go on being brave.

2:12:00.913 --> 2:12:04.832
-Think about your Pa like he used to be.
-I can't think about Pa.

2:12:05.083 --> 2:12:07.251
I can't think of anything
but that $300.

2:12:07.502 --> 2:12:11.923
Ain't no good thinking about that.
Ain't nobody got that much money.

2:12:12.215 --> 2:12:16.302
Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags
got that much money now.

2:12:17.804 --> 2:12:18.846
Rhett.

2:12:19.097 --> 2:12:21.724
MAMMY:
Who that? A Yankee?

2:12:25.979 --> 2:12:29.607
Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale...

2:12:29.816 --> 2:12:32.151
...and I haven't any clothes.

2:12:41.620 --> 2:12:44.246
Go and get Ma's old box
of dress patterns.

2:12:44.498 --> 2:12:47.208
-What you up to?
-You'll make me a new dress.

2:12:47.459 --> 2:12:49.877
Not with Miss Ellen's portières!

2:12:50.128 --> 2:12:52.838
Great balls of fire!
They're my portières now.

2:12:53.048 --> 2:12:56.759
I'm going to Atlanta for $300,
and I've got to look like a queen.

2:12:56.969 --> 2:12:58.761
-Who's going with you?
-I'll go alone.

2:12:58.971 --> 2:13:03.057
That's what you think!
I's going with you and that new dress.

2:13:03.308 --> 2:13:06.060
-Mammy, darling.
-No use to try to sweet talk me.

2:13:06.311 --> 2:13:08.771
I knows you since I put
diapers on you.

2:13:09.022 --> 2:13:12.066
I said I's going with you,
and going I is!

2:13:12.275 --> 2:13:15.486
RHETT: Kings in trade, eh?
Too good for me, major.

2:13:16.196 --> 2:13:18.489
It's a pity the war
wasn't a poker game.

2:13:18.740 --> 2:13:21.575
You'd done better than Grant,
with far less effort.

2:13:21.743 --> 2:13:22.785
What is it?

2:13:23.036 --> 2:13:26.580
There's a lady to see Captain Butler.
Says she's his sister.

2:13:26.873 --> 2:13:28.416
Another sister?

2:13:28.667 --> 2:13:30.918
MAJOR:
This is a jail not a harem, captain.

2:13:31.211 --> 2:13:34.588
CORPORAL: No, she ain't one of those.
She's got her mammy with her.

2:13:35.590 --> 2:13:37.425
She has?

2:13:38.051 --> 2:13:41.595
I'd like to see this one, major.
Without her mammy.

2:13:42.806 --> 2:13:46.600
Let's see, my losses for
the afternoon come to what?

2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:49.520
Three hundred and forty?

2:13:49.730 --> 2:13:52.523
My debts do mount up,
don't they, major?

2:13:52.733 --> 2:13:57.528
All right, corporal, show Captain
Butler's "sister" to his cell.

2:13:57.738 --> 2:14:00.781
Thank you, major.
Excuse me, gentlemen.

2:14:05.037 --> 2:14:09.707
It's hard to be strict with a man
who loses money so pleasantly.

2:14:10.625 --> 2:14:13.127
-Rhett!
-Scarlett!

2:14:13.378 --> 2:14:16.422
My dear little sister!

2:14:16.798 --> 2:14:21.427
It's all right, corporal. My sister
has brought me no files or saws.

2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:27.641
Can I really kiss you?

2:14:27.934 --> 2:14:29.810
On the forehead, like a good brother.

2:14:30.062 --> 2:14:33.314
No, thanks. I'll wait and hope
for better things.

2:14:33.565 --> 2:14:36.484
I was so distressed when
I heard you were in jail.

2:14:36.735 --> 2:14:40.654
I couldn't sleep for thinking.
It's not true they'll hang you?

2:14:40.906 --> 2:14:42.490
Would you be sorry?

2:14:42.741 --> 2:14:44.408
-Oh, Rhett.
-Well, don't worry yet.

2:14:44.659 --> 2:14:47.745
They trumped up a charge,
but they really want my money.

2:14:47.996 --> 2:14:50.664
They think I made off
with the Confederate treasury.

2:14:50.916 --> 2:14:53.459
-Well, did you?
-What a leading question.

2:14:53.668 --> 2:14:55.878
Let's not talk about things
like money.

2:14:56.129 --> 2:14:59.507
How good of you to come and see me.
And how pretty you look!

2:14:59.800 --> 2:15:02.510
How you do run on,
teasing a country girl like me.

2:15:02.803 --> 2:15:07.306
Thank heavens you're not in rags.
I'm tired of women in rags. Turn around.

2:15:08.141 --> 2:15:10.351
You look good enough to eat,
and prosperous.

2:15:10.602 --> 2:15:14.021
I've been doing very well.
Everyone's well at Tara, only...

2:15:14.272 --> 2:15:17.775
...I got so bored, I thought
I'd treat myself to a visit to town.

2:15:18.026 --> 2:15:20.528
You're heartless,
but that's part of your charm.

2:15:20.695 --> 2:15:22.863
You've got more charm
than the law allows.

2:15:23.115 --> 2:15:25.449
I didn't come to talk
silliness about me.

2:15:25.700 --> 2:15:28.536
I was so miserable at the thought
of you in trouble.

2:15:28.787 --> 2:15:31.705
I was mad at you when
you left me on the road to Tara.

2:15:31.915 --> 2:15:34.875
-And I still haven't forgiven you.
-Don't say that.

2:15:35.127 --> 2:15:39.046
Well, I must admit I might not be
alive now, only for you.

2:15:39.297 --> 2:15:43.050
When I think of myself
with anything I could possibly hope for...

2:15:43.301 --> 2:15:47.138
...not a care in the world,
and you here in this horrid jail.

2:15:47.347 --> 2:15:51.058
And not even a human jail,
Rhett, a horse jail!

2:15:51.726 --> 2:15:54.145
Listen to me trying to make jokes...

2:15:54.354 --> 2:15:56.063
...when I really want to cry.

2:15:56.565 --> 2:15:58.315
In a minute I shall cry.

2:16:01.736 --> 2:16:03.028
Scarlett....

2:16:03.363 --> 2:16:04.905
Can it be possible that--?

2:16:05.157 --> 2:16:06.949
Can what be possible, Rhett?

2:16:07.200 --> 2:16:10.703
That you've grown a woman's heart?
A real woman's heart.

2:16:10.954 --> 2:16:14.039
I have, Rhett. I know I have.

2:16:15.876 --> 2:16:19.170
It's worth being in jail
just to hear you say that.

2:16:21.006 --> 2:16:22.756
It's well worth it.

2:16:27.220 --> 2:16:29.597
You can drop the moonlight
and magnolia.

2:16:29.890 --> 2:16:33.767
Things have been going well at Tara?
What've you done with your hands?

2:16:34.102 --> 2:16:39.190
-I went riding without my gloves--
-You've been working like a field hand!

2:16:39.399 --> 2:16:41.567
Why did you lie,
and what are you up to?

2:16:41.776 --> 2:16:44.904
-I almost believed you cared.
-But I do care!

2:16:45.113 --> 2:16:48.240
Let's get down to the truth.
You want something enough...

2:16:48.450 --> 2:16:50.576
...to put on quite a
show in your velvets.

2:16:50.785 --> 2:16:53.204
What is it? Money?

2:16:53.413 --> 2:16:55.998
I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.

2:16:56.249 --> 2:16:58.709
I lied when I said
everything was all right.

2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:03.464
Things are as bad as they possibly
could be. And you've got millions.

2:17:04.466 --> 2:17:06.050
What collateral do you have?

2:17:06.259 --> 2:17:07.760
-My earbobs.
-Not interested.

2:17:07.969 --> 2:17:10.262
-Mortgage on Tara.
-What would I do with a farm?

2:17:10.472 --> 2:17:14.892
-I'd pay you out of next year's cotton.
-Not good enough.

2:17:17.520 --> 2:17:19.813
You once said you loved me.

2:17:20.023 --> 2:17:21.482
If you still love me....

2:17:22.275 --> 2:17:24.652
You haven't forgotten,
I'm not a marrying man.

2:17:25.528 --> 2:17:28.280
No, I haven't forgotten.

2:17:33.536 --> 2:17:35.663
You're not worth $300.

2:17:35.956 --> 2:17:38.791
You'll never mean anything
but misery to any man.

2:17:39.251 --> 2:17:42.086
SCARLETT: I don't care what you say,
only give me the money.

2:17:42.337 --> 2:17:46.006
I won't let Tara go! I can't while
there's a breath left in my body.

2:17:46.174 --> 2:17:49.843
Oh, Rhett, won't you please
give me the money?

2:17:50.136 --> 2:17:52.179
I couldn't if I wanted to.

2:17:52.430 --> 2:17:54.348
My funds are in Liverpool,
not Atlanta.

2:17:54.599 --> 2:17:58.352
If I drew a draft, they'd be on me
like a duck on a June bug.

2:17:58.603 --> 2:18:02.356
So you see, my dear,
you've abased yourself to no purpose.

2:18:04.859 --> 2:18:09.280
Here, here. Stop it! You want
the Yankees to see you like this?

2:18:09.531 --> 2:18:13.617
Take your hands off me, you skunk!
You knew what I wanted.

2:18:13.868 --> 2:18:17.037
You knew you wouldn't lend me
the money and you let me go on!

2:18:17.205 --> 2:18:19.957
I enjoyed hearing
what you had to say. Cheer up.

2:18:20.166 --> 2:18:22.376
Come to my hanging,
I'll put you in my will.

2:18:22.627 --> 2:18:24.378
I'll come to your hanging!

2:18:24.629 --> 2:18:28.632
I'm just afraid they won't hang you
in time to pay the taxes on Tara!

2:18:35.181 --> 2:18:36.724
BELLE:
Tell him Belle Watling.

2:18:36.891 --> 2:18:39.893
Where you been? I thought
you deserted Captain Butler.

2:18:40.186 --> 2:18:42.813
I keep myself occupied.
Help me out.

2:18:51.531 --> 2:18:55.409
Who that? I ain't never see'd hair
that color before in my life.

2:18:55.702 --> 2:18:57.202
You know a dyed-haired woman?

2:18:57.412 --> 2:19:00.581
Wish I knew that one.
She'd get my money for me.

2:19:02.667 --> 2:19:04.543
Whatever they done
to you in there...

2:19:04.753 --> 2:19:08.714
...they didn't do no more than you
deserve for visiting white trash.

2:19:15.597 --> 2:19:17.848
MAN 1: Fresh and green.
MAN 2: Right off the farm.

2:19:18.058 --> 2:19:21.769
MAN 3: What you doing tonight, Susie?
MAN 4: That's a Georgia peach!

2:19:22.062 --> 2:19:23.687
MAN 5:
Nothing like that in Ohio.

2:19:23.855 --> 2:19:25.272
CARPETBAGGER:
You know what we'll do?

2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:26.482
MAN 6:
What?

2:19:26.649 --> 2:19:29.526
We're gonna give every one of you
40 acres and a mule.

2:19:29.778 --> 2:19:32.529
MAN 7: And a mule?
-Forty acres and a mule!

2:19:32.697 --> 2:19:35.115
MAN 7: Gee!
-Because we're your friend.

2:19:35.367 --> 2:19:39.661
And you're gonna become voters
and vote like your friends do!

2:19:41.581 --> 2:19:44.041
MAN 8: What's your hurry?
MAMMY: What's come over this town?

2:19:44.250 --> 2:19:47.961
Yankees have come over it.
Same as they've come over all of them.

2:19:50.131 --> 2:19:51.965
MAMMY:
Out of our way, trash!

2:19:52.258 --> 2:19:54.885
Get out of the way here!
Get away! Go on.

2:20:03.186 --> 2:20:04.686
FRANK:
It can't be Miss Scarlett!

2:20:04.938 --> 2:20:06.605
SCARLETT: Frank Kennedy!
FRANK: And Mammy.

2:20:06.815 --> 2:20:08.690
MAMMY:
It's good to see home folks.

2:20:08.942 --> 2:20:11.777
FRANK: I didn't know you were here.
SCARLETT: I didn't know you were.

2:20:11.986 --> 2:20:14.279
Didn't Suellen tell you
about my store?

2:20:14.489 --> 2:20:17.408
Did she? I don't remember.
Have you a store?

2:20:17.826 --> 2:20:21.161
-This?
-Won't you come in, look around a bit?

2:20:29.337 --> 2:20:31.839
I don't suppose
it looks like much to a lady...

2:20:32.090 --> 2:20:34.341
...but I can't help being proud of it.

2:20:34.592 --> 2:20:37.428
-You're not making money?
-Well, I can't complain.

2:20:37.637 --> 2:20:39.346
In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.

2:20:39.597 --> 2:20:42.015
Folks tell me
I'm just a born merchant.

2:20:42.308 --> 2:20:45.185
Won't be long before
Miss Suellen and I can marry.

2:20:45.437 --> 2:20:48.730
-Are you doing as well as all that?
-Yes, I am.

2:20:48.982 --> 2:20:50.607
I'm no millionaire yet...

2:20:50.859 --> 2:20:53.277
...but I've cleared $1000 already.

2:20:53.528 --> 2:20:54.987
SCARLETT:
And lumber too.

2:20:56.531 --> 2:20:59.366
-That's only a sideline.
-A sideline, Frank?

2:20:59.534 --> 2:21:03.454
With all the good Georgia pine
around Atlanta, and all this building?

2:21:03.663 --> 2:21:06.373
Well, all that takes money,
Miss Scarlett...

2:21:06.624 --> 2:21:08.959
...and I gotta think
about buying a home.

2:21:09.210 --> 2:21:10.544
Why would you want a home?

2:21:10.795 --> 2:21:13.046
For Suellen to set up housekeeping.

2:21:13.506 --> 2:21:14.965
Here in Atlanta.

2:21:15.175 --> 2:21:17.468
You'd want to bring her to Atlanta.

2:21:17.760 --> 2:21:20.387
There wouldn't be much help
in that for Tara.

2:21:21.264 --> 2:21:23.182
I don't know what you mean.

2:21:24.058 --> 2:21:25.809
I don't mean a thing.

2:21:26.478 --> 2:21:29.313
How'd you like to drive me
to my Aunt Pitty's?

2:21:29.647 --> 2:21:31.982
Nothing'd give me more pleasure.

2:21:32.192 --> 2:21:33.775
You better stay to supper.

2:21:34.027 --> 2:21:37.196
Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable,
and I'd like a long visit.

2:21:37.405 --> 2:21:40.908
You act on me just like a tonic,
Miss Scarlett.

2:21:41.242 --> 2:21:43.285
And will you tell me all the news...

2:21:43.536 --> 2:21:44.912
...of Miss Suellen?

2:21:48.082 --> 2:21:51.168
What's the matter?
Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?

2:21:51.669 --> 2:21:55.172
Oh, no, no. I thought
surely she had written you.

2:21:55.381 --> 2:21:58.592
I guess she was ashamed to write you.
She should be ashamed.

2:21:58.843 --> 2:22:01.094
How awful to have such a mean sister.

2:22:01.429 --> 2:22:03.180
You must tell me.

2:22:03.431 --> 2:22:05.390
Don't leave me on tenterhooks.

2:22:05.600 --> 2:22:08.936
Well, she's going to marry
one of the county boys next month.

2:22:10.021 --> 2:22:13.690
She got tired of waiting,
was afraid she'd be an old maid and....

2:22:13.900 --> 2:22:16.818
Oh, I'm sorry to be
the one to tell you.

2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:19.947
It's cold, and I left my muff at home.

2:22:20.240 --> 2:22:23.450
Would you mind if I put my hand
in your pocket?

2:22:39.467 --> 2:22:42.302
But, Melanie, you don't realize
what she's done!

2:22:42.554 --> 2:22:44.972
She's gone and married
my Mr. Kennedy!

2:22:45.223 --> 2:22:47.266
He's my beau and she's married him!

2:22:47.475 --> 2:22:50.727
-She did it to save Tara.
-I hate Tara!

2:22:50.979 --> 2:22:54.565
SUELLEN: I hate Scarlett! She's
the only thing I hate worse than Tara!

2:22:58.820 --> 2:23:00.612
It's all my fault.

2:23:01.447 --> 2:23:04.616
I should've committed robbery
to get that tax money for you.

2:23:04.867 --> 2:23:07.119
I couldn't let you do
anything like that.

2:23:07.370 --> 2:23:08.787
Anyway, it's done now.

2:23:08.997 --> 2:23:11.164
Yes, it's done now.

2:23:11.374 --> 2:23:13.500
You won't let me do
anything dishonorable...

2:23:13.751 --> 2:23:16.837
...yet you'd sell yourself in marriage
to a man you didn't love.

2:23:17.005 --> 2:23:19.840
You won't have to worry
about my helplessness anymore.

2:23:21.509 --> 2:23:22.926
What do you mean?

I'm going to New York.

I've arranged
for a position in a bank.

2:23:28.182 --> 2:23:30.183
But you can't do that.

2:23:32.395 --> 2:23:35.814
I counted on you to help me start
a lumber business and....

2:23:35.982 --> 2:23:37.024
I counted on you.

2:23:40.320 --> 2:23:42.696
You know as much as you do
about banking...

2:23:42.989 --> 2:23:45.699
...and I'd give you half the business.

2:23:45.950 --> 2:23:48.493
That's generous of you, Scarlett.

2:23:48.870 --> 2:23:50.454
But it isn't that.

If I go to Atlanta
and take help from you again...

2:23:53.791 --> 2:23:56.209
...I'd bury any hope
of ever standing alone.

SCARLETT:
Oh, is that all?

2:23:58.004 --> 2:24:02.716
You could gradually buy the business,
and then it would be your own and--

2:24:03.384 --> 2:24:04.843
No, Scarlett.

MELANIE:
What have you done?

2:24:35.375 --> 2:24:37.918
She wanted me to go to Atlanta.

2:24:38.503 --> 2:24:42.172
To help me start my lumber business.
And he won't help me!

2:24:42.757 --> 2:24:44.549
How unchivalrous of you.

2:24:44.759 --> 2:24:46.760
Why, think, Ashley, think!

2:24:47.011 --> 2:24:50.097
If it hadn't been for Scarlett,
I'd have died in Atlanta...

2:24:50.264 --> 2:24:52.766
...and maybe we wouldn't have
little Beau.

and plowing...

...just to keep food in our mouths,
I could just--

2:24:58.439 --> 2:25:00.524
Oh, my darling.

If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher
a free hand...

...you'll get what you want
out of them.

All right, you're the foreman.

2:25:52.076 --> 2:25:55.412

and deliver my lumber when I want it.

GALLEGHER: Johnnie Gallegher's
your man, miss. But remember...

...no questions and no interference.

2:26:11.471 --> 2:26:12.679
Why do you complain?

2:26:12.972 --> 2:26:15.182
You wouldn't own a mill
if I didn't take over.

2:26:15.349 --> 2:26:17.058
But I didn't want the mill.

2:26:17.268 --> 2:26:20.937
We couldn't buy it if you hadn't
pressed our friends for their debts.

Isn’t that right, Ashley?

2:26:22.482 --> 2:26:24.566
Are you running
a charitable institution?

2:26:24.817 --> 2:26:28.195

and take your medicine.

And don't call me "sugar."

She can get mad quicker
than any woman I ever saw.

I don't like to interfere...

2:26:46.506 --> 2:26:49.841
...but I wish you'd let me hire
darkies and not use convicts.

2:26:50.092 --> 2:26:51.218
We could do better.

2:26:51.511 --> 2:26:54.221
Darkies' pay would break us.
Convicts are cheap.

2:26:54.514 --> 2:26:56.181
If we give Gallegher a free hand--

2:26:56.390 --> 2:26:59.643
A free hand? That means
he'll starve and whip them.

you'd give them chicken...

...and tuck them in with quilts.

I won't make money out of the
enforced labor and misery of others.

2:27:12.824 --> 2:27:14.324
You didn't mind owning slaves.

2:27:14.659 --> 2:27:17.160
That was different.
We didn't treat them that way.

...if the war hadn't
already freed them.

who've suffered.

Look at all our friends. They're
keeping their honor and kindness.

and beat them at their own game.

from marrying men you don't love?

there had already been a skirmish.

I found Mr. Wilkes wounded,
and Dr. Meade was with him.

2:41:40.899 --> 2:41:45.069
I had to prove they'd been somewhere,
anyplace but where they were.

2:41:45.362 --> 2:41:48.447
-So I took them to Belle's.
-And she took them in?

2:41:48.699 --> 2:41:51.242

an old friend of mine.

any device of yours.

what Dr. Meade needs.

call on me and thank me.

Here. Dry your eyes.

2:49:01.631 --> 2:49:04.508
If you had it all to do over again,
you'd do no differently.

2:49:04.717 --> 2:49:07.386
You're like the thief
who isn't sorry he stole...

2:49:07.554 --> 2:49:09.930
...but he's terribly sorry
he's going to jail.

2:49:10.181 --> 2:49:12.933
I'm glad Mother's dead.

2:49:13.184 --> 2:49:16.562
I'm glad she's dead
so she can't see me.

2:49:16.729 --> 2:49:20.524
I always wanted to be like her,
calm and kind...

2:49:20.733 --> 2:49:24.069
...and sadly, I've turned out
disappointing.

2:49:25.155 --> 2:49:29.700
You know, Scarlett, I think
you're on the verge of a crying jag.

2:49:36.666 --> 2:49:39.751
So I'll change the subject
and say what I came to say.

2:49:40.003 --> 2:49:42.004
Say it, then, and get out!

2:49:43.006 --> 2:49:46.550
-What is it?
-I can't go on any longer without you.

2:49:46.718 --> 2:49:50.762
Oh! You really are the most ill-bred man
to come here at a time--

2:49:51.014 --> 2:49:53.724
I made up my mind you were
the only woman for me...

2:49:53.975 --> 2:49:55.392
...the first day I saw you.

2:49:55.602 --> 2:49:57.603
Now you have a mill
and Frank's money...

2:49:57.896 --> 2:50:00.105
...and won't come to me
as you did to the jail.

2:50:00.356 --> 2:50:04.735
-So I see I shall have to marry you.
-I never heard of such bad taste.

2:50:04.944 --> 2:50:07.070
Would you be convinced
if I fell to my knees?

2:50:07.447 --> 2:50:09.031
Turn me loose and get out.

2:50:09.282 --> 2:50:12.242
Forgive me for startling you
with my impetuous sentiments...

2:50:12.493 --> 2:50:14.995
...my dear Scarlett--
I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.

2:50:15.246 --> 2:50:18.207
But you must have noticed
that for some time...

2:50:18.458 --> 2:50:21.752
...the friendship I've felt for you
has ripened into a deeper feeling.

2:50:22.003 --> 2:50:26.215
A feeling more beautiful,
more pure, more sacred....

2:50:26.424 --> 2:50:28.550
Dare I name it? Can it be love?

2:50:29.219 --> 2:50:31.637
Get up off your knees.
I don't like your common jokes.

2:50:31.930 --> 2:50:33.931
This is an honorable proposal
of marriage...

2:50:34.140 --> 2:50:37.142
...made at what I consider
a most opportune moment.

2:50:37.310 --> 2:50:40.646
I can't go all my life waiting
to catch you between husbands.

2:50:40.897 --> 2:50:43.899
You're coarse and you're conceited.

2:50:44.108 --> 2:50:47.069
And I think this conversation's
gone far enough.

2:50:47.612 --> 2:50:50.447
Besides, I shall never marry again.

2:50:51.074 --> 2:50:53.909
Oh, yes, you will.
And you'll marry me.

2:50:54.160 --> 2:50:56.161
You? You?

2:50:56.663 --> 2:50:58.288
I don't love you.

2:50:58.539 --> 2:51:01.458
And I don't like being married.

2:51:01.668 --> 2:51:03.919
Ever think of marrying
just for fun?

2:51:04.170 --> 2:51:05.587
Marriage, fun?

2:51:05.797 --> 2:51:08.507
Fiddle-dee-dee!
Fun for men, you mean.

2:51:08.758 --> 2:51:10.300
Do you want them to hear you?

2:51:10.551 --> 2:51:12.803
You've been married
to a boy and an old man.

2:51:13.054 --> 2:51:16.682
Why not try a husband of the right age,
with a way with women?

2:51:16.933 --> 2:51:19.142
You're a fool, Rhett Butler...

2:51:19.352 --> 2:51:22.479
...when you know I shall always love
another man.

2:51:22.772 --> 2:51:24.982
Stop it. You hear me? Stop it.

2:51:25.191 --> 2:51:27.067
No more of that talk.

2:51:32.448 --> 2:51:33.782
Don't. I shall faint.

2:51:34.033 --> 2:51:36.702
I want you to faint.
This is what you're meant for.

2:51:36.953 --> 2:51:39.496
None of those fools
have kissed you like this.

2:51:39.706 --> 2:51:43.125

or your stupid Ashley.

2:51:50.883 --> 2:51:53.969
Say you're going to marry me.
Say yes. Say yes.

2:51:54.220 --> 2:51:55.637
Yes.

2:51:57.390 --> 2:52:00.058
Are you sure you meant it?
You don't want to take it back?

2:52:00.226 --> 2:52:01.518
No.

2:52:01.728 --> 2:52:04.229
Look at me,
and try to tell me the truth.

2:52:04.480 --> 2:52:06.898
Did you say yes because of my money?

2:52:07.191 --> 2:52:10.068
Well, yes, partly.

2:52:11.070 --> 2:52:12.321
Partly?

2:52:12.739 --> 2:52:15.240
Well, you know, Rhett,
money does help.

2:52:15.533 --> 2:52:18.618
-And, of course, I am fond of you.
-Fond of me?

2:52:18.870 --> 2:52:22.331
If I said I was madly in love
with you, you'd know I was lying.

2:52:22.540 --> 2:52:26.209
-You say we have a lot in common--
-Yes, you're right, my dear.

2:52:26.419 --> 2:52:28.587
I'm not in love
any more than you are.

2:52:28.755 --> 2:52:31.548
Heaven help the man
who ever really loves you.

2:52:31.758 --> 2:52:33.592
What kind of ring would you like?

2:52:33.843 --> 2:52:36.762
A diamond ring,
and do buy a great big one.

2:52:37.013 --> 2:52:40.057
You'll have the biggest
and most vulgar ring in Atlanta.

2:52:40.266 --> 2:52:43.935
I'll take you to New Orleans
for the most expensive honeymoon.

2:52:44.187 --> 2:52:47.606
-That'd be heavenly.
-I'll buy your trousseau for you too.

2:52:47.857 --> 2:52:49.941
How wonderful...

2:52:50.234 --> 2:52:52.611
...but you won't tell anybody,
will you?

2:52:52.862 --> 2:52:55.280
Still the little hypocrite.

2:52:57.241 --> 2:52:59.034
Won't you kiss me goodbye?

2:52:59.285 --> 2:53:01.787
You've had enough kissing
for one afternoon.

2:53:02.038 --> 2:53:05.415
You're impossible. You can go.
I don't care if you never come back.

2:53:05.666 --> 2:53:07.584
But I will come back.

2:53:21.974 --> 2:53:23.892
What are you thinking about, Scarlett?

2:53:24.143 --> 2:53:26.770
I'm thinking about how rich we are.

2:53:28.064 --> 2:53:30.148
I can keep the lumber business too?

2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:32.818
Yes, of course you can,
if it amuses you.

2:53:33.069 --> 2:53:37.197
Now that you're so rich, you can tell
everybody to go to the devil.

2:53:37.407 --> 2:53:40.492
But you were the main one
I wanted to go to the devil.

RHETT: It'd be nice if you bought
something for Mammy.

2:54:13.985 --> 2:54:17.487
Why should I buy her a present
when she called us both mules?

2:54:17.738 --> 2:54:19.156
Mules? Why mules?

2:54:19.365 --> 2:54:23.952
She said we could give ourselves air
and get slicked up like racehorses...

2:54:24.203 --> 2:54:27.873
...but we were just mules in horse
harness and we didn't fool anybody.

whose respect I'd like to have.

-I won't give her a thing.
-Then I'll take her a petticoat.

2:54:40.178 --> 2:54:42.304
My mammy said
when she went to heaven...

2:54:42.472 --> 2:54:46.558
...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat
so stiff that it'd stand by itself...

2:54:46.809 --> 2:54:49.769
...and so rustley the Lord would say
it's made of angels' wings.

2:54:49.979 --> 2:54:52.814
She won't take it from you.
She'd rather die than wear it.

-Find what, honey?
-I don't know.

Oh, Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream
that I found it, and that I'm safe?

Dreams don't work that way.

2:55:36.317 --> 2:55:38.568
But when you get used
to being safe and warm...

2:55:38.778 --> 2:55:40.904

She's the first person who's ever
completely belonged to me.

2:59:53.032 --> 2:59:54.574
Great balls of fire!

2:59:54.825 --> 2:59:56.659
I had the baby, didn't I?

2:59:57.203 --> 2:59:59.704
MELANIE: It's Melanie. May I come in?
-Come in.

3:00:00.039 --> 3:00:04.459
Yes, come in and look at
my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.

3:00:05.795 --> 3:00:08.379
Most babies have blue eyes
when they're born.

3:00:08.672 --> 3:00:11.466
Don't tell him anything.
He knows everything about babies.

3:00:11.675 --> 3:00:14.803
Nevertheless, her eyes are blue
and they'll stay blue.

3:00:15.054 --> 3:00:17.597
As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.

3:00:17.973 --> 3:00:19.974
That's it.
That's what we'll call her.

3:00:20.476 --> 3:00:22.393
"Bonnie Blue Butler."

3:00:30.402 --> 3:00:32.195
Try again, Mammy.

3:00:39.703 --> 3:00:40.995
Twenty inches.

3:00:41.247 --> 3:00:44.707
Twenty inches.
I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.

3:00:44.917 --> 3:00:47.252
You simply gotta make it 18 1/2 again.

3:00:47.503 --> 3:00:48.878
You done had a baby.

3:00:49.129 --> 3:00:51.923
And you ain't never gonna be
no 18 1/2 inches again.

3:00:52.174 --> 3:00:54.092
There ain't nothing to do about it.

3:00:55.177 --> 3:00:57.053
There is something to do about it.

3:00:57.263 --> 3:01:00.557
I'm just not going to get old and fat
before my time.

3:01:01.058 --> 3:01:03.434
I just won't have any more babies.

3:01:03.936 --> 3:01:07.438
I heard Mr. Rhett say
that he'd be wanting a son next year.

3:01:07.731 --> 3:01:10.400
Tell Captain Butler I decided
not to go out.

3:01:10.651 --> 3:01:12.443
I'll have supper in my room.

3:01:33.048 --> 3:01:34.757
I got your message.

3:01:34.967 --> 3:01:37.677
I'll have them bring
my supper up here too.

3:01:43.684 --> 3:01:45.393
No objections to that, I hope?

3:01:45.603 --> 3:01:46.811
No.

3:01:47.980 --> 3:01:49.981
Yes. Uh....

3:01:51.066 --> 3:01:53.943
I mean, I don't care
where you have your supper.

3:01:55.988 --> 3:01:57.113
Rhett....

3:01:57.948 --> 3:02:00.408
RHETT: Yes?
-You see....

3:02:00.618 --> 3:02:02.827
Well, I've decided....

3:02:04.496 --> 3:02:07.415
Well, I hope I don't have
any more children.

3:02:19.637 --> 3:02:23.181
My pet, as I told you
before Bonnie was born...

3:02:23.432 --> 3:02:26.309
...it's immaterial to me
whether you have one child or 20.

3:02:26.518 --> 3:02:28.353
No, but you know what I....

3:02:28.812 --> 3:02:30.229
Do you know what I mean?

3:02:30.481 --> 3:02:34.359
I do. And do you know
I can divorce you for this?

3:02:34.860 --> 3:02:36.861
You're low enough to think of that.

3:02:37.154 --> 3:02:39.656
If you had any chivalry in you,
or were nice....

3:02:39.865 --> 3:02:44.202
Look at Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can't
have any more children and he....

3:02:45.829 --> 3:02:48.373
You've been to the lumber office
this afternoon.

3:02:48.624 --> 3:02:50.458
What has that got to do with it?

3:02:51.877 --> 3:02:55.254
Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.
Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.

3:02:55.506 --> 3:02:58.383
It's no use. You wouldn't understand.

3:02:58.884 --> 3:03:02.053
-You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
-Sorry for me?

3:03:02.304 --> 3:03:05.515
Yes, sorry for you because you throw
away happiness with both hands...

3:03:05.683 --> 3:03:08.226
...and reach out for something
that'll never make you happy.

3:03:08.394 --> 3:03:10.019
I don't know
what you're talking about.

3:03:10.187 --> 3:03:14.482
If you were free and Melly were dead
and you had your precious Ashley...

3:03:14.733 --> 3:03:16.734
...do you think you'd be happy?

3:03:17.319 --> 3:03:20.905
You'd never know him,
never even understand his mind...

3:03:21.156 --> 3:03:23.992
...any more than you understand
anything, except money.

3:03:24.493 --> 3:03:26.077
Never mind about that. I want--

3:03:26.370 --> 3:03:30.498
You may keep your sanctity.
It'll work no hardship on me.

3:03:30.749 --> 3:03:32.000
You don't care?

3:03:32.376 --> 3:03:34.585
The world is full
of many things and people...

3:03:34.837 --> 3:03:38.423
...and I shan't be lonely.
I will find comfort elsewhere.

3:03:38.674 --> 3:03:39.882
Well, that's fine.

3:03:40.092 --> 3:03:43.678
But I warn you, in case you change
your mind, I intend to lock my door.

3:03:43.887 --> 3:03:45.013
Why bother?

3:03:45.264 --> 3:03:48.433
If I wanted to come in,
no lock could keep me out.

3:04:05.951 --> 3:04:07.618
I knew most women were cheats...

3:04:07.911 --> 3:04:10.121
...hypocritical and hard,
but this one....

3:04:10.414 --> 3:04:12.623
-It ain't no use.
-What do you mean?

3:04:12.916 --> 3:04:14.751
I mean you're poisoned with her.

3:04:14.960 --> 3:04:18.463
I don't care what she's done to you.
You're still in love with her.

3:04:18.714 --> 3:04:23.051
-It pleasures me none to say it.
-Maybe so, but I'm through with her.

3:04:23.302 --> 3:04:27.221
You've gotta think of the child.
Child's worth 10 of the mother.

3:04:33.270 --> 3:04:34.979
You're a shrewd woman, Belle.

3:04:35.147 --> 3:04:36.981
And a very nice one.

3:04:37.983 --> 3:04:38.983
Yes, Rhett?

3:04:39.234 --> 3:04:42.653
I was just thinking of the difference
between you and....

3:04:42.863 --> 3:04:45.656
You're both hardheaded businesswomen,
and successful.

3:04:46.366 --> 3:04:48.493
But you've got a heart, Belle.

3:04:49.995 --> 3:04:51.829
And you're honest.

3:04:54.083 --> 3:04:55.249
Goodbye, Rhett.

3:04:56.794 --> 3:04:58.086
Goodbye, Belle.

3:05:13.685 --> 3:05:16.020
RHETT:
She'll be a wonderful horsewoman.

3:05:16.188 --> 3:05:18.189
Look at those hands. And that seat!

SCARLETT:
Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!

3:05:20.025 --> 3:05:22.693
Why we have to wheel a baby
when we have servants--

3:05:22.903 --> 3:05:25.863
-Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
MERRIWETHER: Captain Butler.

3:05:26.031 --> 3:05:27.156
Good morning, Scarlett.

3:05:27.324 --> 3:05:30.034
Making fools of ourselves
in front of these buffaloes.

3:05:30.285 --> 3:05:32.829
If you'd thought of your position,
you wouldn't have to.

3:05:33.038 --> 3:05:38.126
But as it is, we're going to cultivate
every female dragon of the Old Guard--

3:05:38.335 --> 3:05:41.462
-Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
WHITING: Captain Butler.

3:05:41.713 --> 3:05:43.673
Good morning, Scarlett.

3:05:43.924 --> 3:05:47.051
So the millionaire speculator
is turning respectable.

3:05:47.302 --> 3:05:49.387
Money can't buy
what I want for Bonnie.

3:05:49.638 --> 3:05:51.722
I'll admit I've been at fault too.

3:05:51.974 --> 3:05:54.058
Bonnie will have a place
among decent people.

3:05:54.351 --> 3:05:58.563
Even if we both have to crawl
on our bellies to every fat old cat--

3:05:58.856 --> 3:06:00.648
Good morning, Mrs. Meade.

3:06:00.858 --> 3:06:04.402
MRS. MEADE: Good morning, Captain
Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.

3:06:09.825 --> 3:06:12.743
RHETT: Mrs. Merriwether, I have
great regard for your knowledge.

3:06:13.036 --> 3:06:15.580
-Could you give me some advice?
-Why, certainly.

3:06:15.747 --> 3:06:17.999
My Bonnie sucks her thumb.
I can't stop her.

3:06:18.250 --> 3:06:20.918
You should make her stop!
It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.

3:06:21.086 --> 3:06:23.838
I know, I know.
She has such a beautiful mouth too.

3:06:24.089 --> 3:06:26.591
-I tried putting soap on her nails.
MERRIWETHER: Soap? Bah!

3:06:26.842 --> 3:06:30.386
Put quinine on her thumb and
she'll stop sucking it quick enough.

3:06:30.596 --> 3:06:33.222
Quinine! I never would have
thought of it.

3:06:33.473 --> 3:06:35.391
I can't thank you enough.

3:06:35.601 --> 3:06:38.102
You've taken a great load off my mind.

3:06:38.353 --> 3:06:39.604
Good morning.

3:06:42.441 --> 3:06:45.401
Good morning, Dolly.
Wasn't that Captain Butler?

3:06:45.611 --> 3:06:48.279
Good morning, Caroline.
I was just thinking...

3:06:48.572 --> 3:06:52.575
...there's a great deal of good in
a man who would love a child so much.

3:06:52.784 --> 3:06:54.785
But of course there is.

3:06:55.037 --> 3:06:59.248
Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that
Captain Butler finally admitted...

3:06:59.458 --> 3:07:03.252
...that he was honored for his
services at the Battle of Franklin.

3:07:03.503 --> 3:07:05.963
No, and did I tell you
that Captain Butler made...

3:07:06.215 --> 3:07:10.509
...a stupendous contribution to the
Association for the Beautification...

3:07:10.719 --> 3:07:13.012
-...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
-No!

3:07:14.139 --> 3:07:17.808
My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,
is giving a party for Bonnie next week.

3:07:18.101 --> 3:07:22.230
Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was
my idea to give a party for Bonnie.

3:07:22.481 --> 3:07:26.150
Why, Caroline Meade,
how can you say a thing like that?

RHETT: Grip tightly with your legs.
Lean forward and go with him.

3:07:56.598 --> 3:07:59.517
Hold your reins properly
in a firm hand. Up!

3:08:00.602 --> 3:08:02.853
That was fine. I knew you'd do it.

3:08:03.146 --> 3:08:05.773
When you're older,
I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.

Did you see her?
Wasn't she wonderful?

3:08:17.786 --> 3:08:20.288
Mr. Rhett, I done told you
and told you...

3:08:20.539 --> 3:08:24.458
...it just ain't fittin' for a girl to ride
astraddle with her dress flying up.

3:08:25.043 --> 3:08:27.211
All right. I'll teach her
to ride sidesaddle.

3:08:27.462 --> 3:08:30.506
And I'll buy her a blue velvet
riding habit. She'll love that.

3:08:30.799 --> 3:08:33.092
A nice black broadcloth
is what little girls wear.

Oh, now, Mammy,

3:08:35.804 --> 3:08:38.723
Well, I don't think it's fittin', but....

3:08:40.100 --> 3:08:42.685
It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.

doing downtown at this time of day?

3:08:59.411 --> 3:09:00.411
Well, Ashley, I just--

Why aren't you helping Melly
with my surprise birthday party?

3:09:04.207 --> 3:09:07.710
Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't
supposed to know anything about that.

3:09:07.919 --> 3:09:10.629
Melly'd be so disappointed
if you weren't surprised.

3:09:10.881 --> 3:09:12.089
I won't let on.

3:09:12.257 --> 3:09:14.717

3:09:24.061 --> 3:09:26.937
...all the figures I ever knew
go right out of my head.

Figures are well lost when
the bonnet's as pretty as that.

Scarlett, you know,
you get prettier all the time.

You haven't changed a bit since
our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...

surrounded by dozens of beaus.

No reason you shouldn't

You heard nothing of the kind.

-You must need a drink badly.
-I do not.

You're wondering if she did it
just to save face.

-I will not listen.
-Yes, you'll listen.

Miss Melly's a fool,
but not the kind you think.

She has too much honor to conceive
of dishonor in anyone she loves.

And she loves you.

I'm sure I don't know.

Mr. Wilkes, who can't be
mentally faithful to his wife...

3:16:43.583 --> 3:16:46.502

3:16:57.096 --> 3:16:59.848
I could tear you to pieces with them.

And I'd do it if it'd take
Ashley out of your mind forever.

3:17:04.854 --> 3:17:06.313
But it wouldn't.

I want Rhett!

3:26:51.190 --> 3:26:54.484
MAMMY: What's the matter, honey?
Did you call somebody, child?

3:26:54.777 --> 3:26:59.322
It's no use. It's no use!

3:27:07.832 --> 3:27:09.124
[KNOCKING]

3:27:20.803 --> 3:27:22.846
Dr. Meade's left.

3:27:23.347 --> 3:27:26.850
-Scarlett's dead.
-Oh, no, she's much better.

3:27:27.017 --> 3:27:28.935
Really she is.

3:27:45.244 --> 3:27:48.121
There, there, Captain Butler,
you're beside yourself.

3:27:48.330 --> 3:27:51.291
She'll very soon be well again.
I promise you.

3:27:51.500 --> 3:27:53.543
She never wanted this baby.

3:27:53.794 --> 3:27:56.463
Not want a baby?
Why, every woman wants a baby.

3:27:56.672 --> 3:27:59.382
You do, but she doesn't.
Not my children.

3:27:59.550 --> 3:28:01.551
She told me she didn't want any more.

3:28:01.760 --> 3:28:05.054
I wanted to hurt her because
she'd hurt me. And I did.

3:28:05.306 --> 3:28:08.391
You mustn't tell me these things.
It's not fair to--

3:28:08.642 --> 3:28:11.311
I didn't know about this baby
until she fell.

3:28:11.562 --> 3:28:14.272
If I'd only known,
I'd have come straight home.

3:28:14.482 --> 3:28:16.399
Well, of course you would.

3:28:16.650 --> 3:28:20.069
And then when she told me
there on the steps, what did I do?

3:28:20.404 --> 3:28:22.906
What did I say?
I laughed and I said--

3:28:23.157 --> 3:28:26.075
But you didn't mean it.
I know you didn't mean it.

3:28:26.285 --> 3:28:29.204
But I did mean it.
I was crazy with jealousy.

3:28:29.413 --> 3:28:33.374
She's never cared for me. I tried
to make her care, but I couldn't.

3:28:34.919 --> 3:28:36.252
You're so wrong.

3:28:36.420 --> 3:28:40.882
Scarlett loves you a great deal.
Much more than she knows.

3:28:41.425 --> 3:28:45.428
If that were true, I'd wait forever.
If she'd only forgive me.

3:28:45.596 --> 3:28:49.599
She will. You must be patient.

3:28:51.060 --> 3:28:56.189
No, it's not possible. If you
only knew who she really loved--

3:28:57.316 --> 3:28:59.025
You wouldn't believe it.

3:29:01.946 --> 3:29:04.364
Surely you haven't
listened to idle gossip.

3:29:04.615 --> 3:29:08.201
No, Captain Butler.
I wouldn't believe it.

3:29:09.119 --> 3:29:13.831
There, there. Scarlett's going to get well,
and there can be other babies.

3:29:14.708 --> 3:29:17.377
She couldn't even if she wanted to.

3:29:17.628 --> 3:29:21.256
But of course she could!
I'm going to.

3:29:24.552 --> 3:29:27.845
No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.
It's too dangerous.

3:29:28.097 --> 3:29:31.057
Children are life renewing itself,
Captain Butler.

3:29:31.308 --> 3:29:36.145
And when life does that,
danger seems very unimportant.

3:29:37.898 --> 3:29:41.568
I've never before known anyone
who was really brave.

3:29:41.819 --> 3:29:44.737
I pray God things go well
with you, Miss Melly.

3:29:44.989 --> 3:29:49.284
And I want to thank you for all
you've done for me and for Scarlett.

3:29:49.994 --> 3:29:52.161
From my heart, I thank you.

3:29:58.627 --> 3:30:01.963
Miss Scarlett's feeling
a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.

3:30:02.172 --> 3:30:03.673
Thank you, Mammy.

3:30:10.764 --> 3:30:12.849
I've come to ask your forgiveness...

3:30:13.017 --> 3:30:15.685
...hoping our life together
has another chance.

3:30:15.936 --> 3:30:19.939
Our life together? When did we
ever have a life together?

3:30:21.191 --> 3:30:22.984
Yes, you're right.

3:30:23.193 --> 3:30:27.030
But I'm sure if we could only
try again, we could be happy.

3:30:27.323 --> 3:30:29.198
What is there
to make us happy now?

3:30:30.534 --> 3:30:33.494
Well, there's Bonnie...

3:30:33.912 --> 3:30:35.705
...and I love you, Scarlett.

3:30:36.040 --> 3:30:37.707
When did you discover that?

3:30:37.958 --> 3:30:42.045
I've always loved you, but you've
never given me a chance to show it.

3:30:43.922 --> 3:30:46.215
And just what do you want me to do?

3:30:47.301 --> 3:30:51.220
To begin with, give up the mill,
Scarlett. We'll go away.

3:30:51.472 --> 3:30:53.556
We'll take Bonnie
and have another honeymoon.

3:30:53.807 --> 3:30:56.476
Give up the mill?
It's making more money than ever.

3:30:56.727 --> 3:30:59.228
I know, but we don't need it.
Sell it.

3:30:59.730 --> 3:31:03.232
Or give it to Ashley.
Melanie's been such a friend to us.

3:31:03.484 --> 3:31:06.027
Melanie!
If you'd only think more about me!

3:31:06.320 --> 3:31:08.237
I am thinking of you.

3:31:08.822 --> 3:31:11.532
And I'm thinking that, well...

3:31:12.076 --> 3:31:15.161
...maybe the mill's taking you
away from me and Bonnie.

3:31:15.913 --> 3:31:18.539
I know what you're thinking.
Don't bring Bonnie into it.

3:31:18.749 --> 3:31:21.501
-You're taking her away from me.
-But she loves you.

3:31:21.752 --> 3:31:25.421
You've made her love you and not me.
She's so spoiled now, that--

3:31:25.589 --> 3:31:28.591
Mommy, Daddy! Watch me.

3:31:28.759 --> 3:31:30.259
SCARLETT:
We're watching, darling.

3:31:30.678 --> 3:31:32.345
You're mighty pretty, precious.

3:31:32.596 --> 3:31:34.097
So are you.

3:31:34.348 --> 3:31:37.266
I'm going to jump.
Watch me, Daddy.

3:31:37.518 --> 3:31:40.228
I don't think you ought
to do much jumping yet.

3:31:40.437 --> 3:31:42.480
You just learned
to ride sidesaddle.

3:31:42.940 --> 3:31:44.190
I will so jump.

3:31:44.400 --> 3:31:47.110
I can jump better than ever,
because I've grown.

3:31:47.403 --> 3:31:48.778
I moved the bar higher.

3:31:49.029 --> 3:31:50.571
Don't let her do it, Rhett.

3:31:50.781 --> 3:31:52.532
No, Bonnie, you can't.

3:31:52.741 --> 3:31:54.867
If you fall off,
don't cry and blame me!

3:31:55.869 --> 3:31:58.788
Rhett, stop her.

3:31:59.415 --> 3:32:00.456

3:32:01.125 --> 3:32:02.291

3:32:03.627 --> 3:32:05.628
She's just like Pa.

3:32:08.632 --> 3:32:10.633
Just like Pa...!

I sure is glad you's come.

3:32:44.793 --> 3:32:49.255
Oh, Mammy, this house won't seem
the same without Bonnie.

3:32:49.506 --> 3:32:51.424
How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?

3:32:51.675 --> 3:32:54.761
Miss Melly, this here's
done broke her heart.

3:32:55.012 --> 3:32:57.346
I didn't fetch you
on Miss Scarlett's account.

3:32:57.639 --> 3:33:02.769
What that child got to stand, the good
Lord give her strength to stand.

3:33:03.270 --> 3:33:06.105
It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.

3:33:09.109 --> 3:33:11.778
He done lost his mind
these last couple of days.

3:33:12.029 --> 3:33:13.446
Oh, no, Mammy, no.

3:33:13.697 --> 3:33:18.201
I ain't never seen no man, black or white,
set such store on any child.

3:33:18.452 --> 3:33:20.703
When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...

3:33:20.954 --> 3:33:25.333
...Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run
out and shoot that poor pony.

3:33:25.584 --> 3:33:28.836
And for a minute,
I think he gonna shoot hisself.

3:33:29.087 --> 3:33:30.630
Oh, poor Captain Butler.

3:33:30.881 --> 3:33:35.510
Miss Scarlett called him a murderer
for teaching that child to jump.

3:33:35.719 --> 3:33:38.554
She said, "You give me my baby
what you killed."

3:33:38.806 --> 3:33:42.892
And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't
never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.

3:33:43.185 --> 3:33:47.021
It like to turn my blood cold,
the things they say to one another.

3:33:47.231 --> 3:33:50.107
Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.

3:33:52.653 --> 3:33:54.487
And then that night...

3:33:55.572 --> 3:33:59.242
...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself
in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.

3:34:00.369 --> 3:34:03.746
He wouldn't open the door when
Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.

3:34:04.039 --> 3:34:06.207
And that's where he's been
for two whole days.

3:34:06.375 --> 3:34:08.417
Oh, Mammy!

3:34:08.752 --> 3:34:12.421
This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted
through the door and said:

3:34:12.714 --> 3:34:14.423
"The funeral's set for tomorrow."

3:34:14.675 --> 3:34:17.343
He says, "You try that,
and I kills you tomorrow.

3:34:17.719 --> 3:34:22.723
Do you think I's gonna put my child
in the dark when she's so scared of it?"

Oh, Mammy, Mammy!

3:34:24.268 --> 3:34:27.436
-He has lost his mind!
-Yes'm, that's the God's truth.

3:34:27.688 --> 3:34:31.607
He ain't gonna let us bury
that child. You gotta help us.

3:34:31.775 --> 3:34:33.276
Oh, but I can't intrude.

If you can't help us, who can?

by your opinion.

3:34:40.868 --> 3:34:42.869
Please, Miss Melly.

3:34:43.745 --> 3:34:46.789

and leave us alone.

And why can't I go along, please?

We can't always go along, Beau,
as much as we may want to.

3:36:32.813 --> 3:36:34.897
You're going back to bed now.

Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying.
She can't be.

3:36:39.528 --> 3:36:42.363
She hasn't your strength.
She's never had any.

-She's never had anything but heart.
-You knew that too?

It's morning.

...to show me that I could never
mean any more to you...

3:40:47.025 --> 3:40:49.485
...than this Watling woman
does to Rhett.

3:40:51.446 --> 3:40:56.325
And I've loved something
that doesn't really exist.

3:40:58.536 --> 3:41:00.120
But somehow...

3:41:01.164 --> 3:41:02.831
...I don't care.

3:41:04.084 --> 3:41:06.168
Somehow, it doesn't matter.

3:41:07.921 --> 3:41:10.339
It doesn't matter one bit.

3:41:13.051 --> 3:41:14.343
Oh, Ashley....

3:41:14.594 --> 3:41:16.428
Ashley, forgive me.

3:41:16.680 --> 3:41:20.182
Don't cry. She mustn't see
you've been crying.

3:41:20.433 --> 3:41:21.558
Ashley!

3:41:24.938 --> 3:41:26.188
ASHLEY:
Melly!

3:41:28.149 --> 3:41:29.566
Melly!

3:41:33.989 --> 3:41:36.532
Rhett! Rhett!

3:41:39.369 --> 3:41:41.203
Rhett, where are you?

3:41:45.166 --> 3:41:47.209
Rhett, wait for me!

3:41:51.715 --> 3:41:53.716
Rhett, wait for me!

3:41:56.011 --> 3:41:57.136
Rhett!

3:41:59.139 --> 3:42:00.472
Rhett!

3:42:02.100 --> 3:42:03.892
Rhett!

3:42:07.897 --> 3:42:09.064
Rhett!

3:42:09.482 --> 3:42:10.607
Rhett!

3:42:12.360 --> 3:42:13.736
Rhett!

3:42:17.032 --> 3:42:18.240
Rhett!

3:42:20.493 --> 3:42:21.618
Rhett!

3:42:24.831 --> 3:42:26.248
Come in.

3:42:33.923 --> 3:42:35.257
Rhett....

3:42:35.633 --> 3:42:38.135
Melanie, she's...?

3:42:40.930 --> 3:42:42.514
Well, God rest her.

3:42:42.932 --> 3:42:46.268
She was the only completely
kind person I ever knew.

3:42:46.728 --> 3:42:50.439
A great lady. A very great lady.

3:42:52.776 --> 3:42:56.695
So she's dead. That makes it
nice for you, doesn't it?

3:42:56.946 --> 3:43:01.700
How can you say such a thing?
You know how I loved her, really.

3:43:01.951 --> 3:43:04.036
No, I don't know that I do.

3:43:04.287 --> 3:43:06.955
It's to your credit that
you could appreciate her.

3:43:07.207 --> 3:43:11.710
Of course I appreciated her.
She thought of everybody except herself.

3:43:11.920 --> 3:43:16.131
-Why, her last words were about you.
-What did she say?

3:43:16.383 --> 3:43:19.676
She said, "Be kind to Captain Butler...

3:43:19.928 --> 3:43:21.929
...he loves you so."

3:43:26.768 --> 3:43:29.645
RHETT: Did she say anything else?
SCARLETT: She said....

3:43:30.063 --> 3:43:33.399
She asked me to look after Ashley too.

3:43:34.734 --> 3:43:38.195
It's convenient to have
the first wife's permission, isn't it?

3:43:40.281 --> 3:43:41.949
What do you mean?

3:43:44.327 --> 3:43:45.953
What are you doing?

3:43:46.162 --> 3:43:47.788
I'm leaving you, my dear.

3:43:47.997 --> 3:43:53.001
All you need now is a divorce,
and your dreams of Ashley can come true.

3:43:54.963 --> 3:43:57.005
Oh, no!

3:43:57.257 --> 3:43:59.508
No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.

3:43:59.801 --> 3:44:00.968
I don't want a divorce.

3:44:01.219 --> 3:44:04.263
Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight,
when I knew I loved you...

3:44:04.514 --> 3:44:07.349
...I ran home to tell you.
Oh, darling, darling!

3:44:07.642 --> 3:44:09.017
Please don't go on with this.

3:44:09.269 --> 3:44:12.938
Leave us some dignity out
of our marriage. Spare us this last.

3:44:13.189 --> 3:44:17.734
This last? Do listen to me! I must
have loved you for years, only...

3:44:17.986 --> 3:44:19.862
...I was such a fool,
I didn't know it.

3:44:20.155 --> 3:44:24.700
Please believe me. You must care.
Melly said you did.

3:44:24.951 --> 3:44:28.120
I believe you.
And what about Ashley Wilkes?

3:44:28.705 --> 3:44:31.165
I never really loved Ashley.

3:44:31.374 --> 3:44:34.877
You certainly gave a good imitation
of it, up to this morning.

3:44:36.004 --> 3:44:38.464
No, Scarlett. I've tried everything.

3:44:38.673 --> 3:44:41.633
If you'd met me halfway, even
when I came back from London.

3:44:41.885 --> 3:44:45.387
I was so glad to see you.
I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.

3:44:45.638 --> 3:44:48.515
Then when you were sick,
and it was all my fault.

3:44:48.766 --> 3:44:51.393
I hoped that you'd call for me.
But you didn't.

3:44:51.686 --> 3:44:54.646
I wanted you. I wanted you
desperately...

3:44:54.856 --> 3:44:57.065
...but I didn't think you wanted me.

3:44:57.317 --> 3:45:00.152
It seems we've been
at cross purposes, doesn't it?

3:45:00.403 --> 3:45:02.237
But it's no use now.

3:45:02.489 --> 3:45:05.908
As long as there was Bonnie,
there was a chance we might be happy.

3:45:06.159 --> 3:45:09.244
I liked to think that Bonnie
was you, a little girl again.

3:45:09.496 --> 3:45:12.247
Before the war and poverty
had done things to you.

3:45:12.499 --> 3:45:14.166
She was so like you.

3:45:14.375 --> 3:45:17.586
And I could pet her and spoil her,
as I wanted to spoil you.

3:45:19.297 --> 3:45:22.049
But when she went, she took everything.

3:45:23.176 --> 3:45:26.345
Rhett, please don't say that.
I'm so sorry.

3:45:26.596 --> 3:45:29.348
I'm so sorry for everything.

3:45:30.016 --> 3:45:32.267
My darling, you're such a child.

3:45:32.519 --> 3:45:37.439
You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"
all the past can be corrected.

3:45:39.234 --> 3:45:41.610
Here, take my handkerchief.

3:45:41.861 --> 3:45:46.240
Never, in any crisis of your life, have
I known you to have a handkerchief.

3:45:50.370 --> 3:45:52.913
Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?

3:45:53.122 --> 3:45:55.624
I'm going to Charleston,
back where I belong.

3:45:55.917 --> 3:45:58.126
Please. Please take me with you.

3:45:58.336 --> 3:46:01.213
No. I'm through
with everything here.

3:46:01.756 --> 3:46:04.132
I want peace.
I want to see if somewhere...

3:46:04.425 --> 3:46:08.136
...there isn't something left
in life of charm and grace.

3:46:08.388 --> 3:46:10.138
-You know what I'm talking about?
-No!

3:46:10.390 --> 3:46:14.309
-I only know that I love you!
-That's your misfortune.

3:46:14.644 --> 3:46:16.270
Oh, Rhett!

3:46:20.984 --> 3:46:22.401
Rhett!

3:46:24.654 --> 3:46:26.071
Rhett! Rhett!

3:46:28.408 --> 3:46:33.370
Rhett! If you go, where shall I go?
What shall I do?

3:46:33.621 --> 3:46:36.665
Frankly, my dear,
I don't give a damn.

3:46:49.929 --> 3:46:52.973
I can't let him go. I can't!

3:46:53.266 --> 3:46:56.310
There must be some way
to bring him back.

3:46:57.520 --> 3:47:02.524
Oh, I can't think about this now.
I'll go crazy if I do.

3:47:03.484 --> 3:47:05.861
I'll think about it tomorrow.

3:47:20.043 --> 3:47:22.836
But I must think about it!

3:47:23.046 --> 3:47:25.297
I must think about it.

3:47:26.007 --> 3:47:28.216
What is there to do?

3:47:29.135 --> 3:47:31.553
What is there that matters?

3:47:34.057 --> 3:47:38.143
GERALD: You mean to tell me,
Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything?

3:47:38.394 --> 3:47:42.814
Land's the only thing that matters.
It's the only thing that lasts.

3:47:43.066 --> 3:47:46.693
ASHLEY: Something you love more than
me, though you may not know it. Tara.

3:47:46.944 --> 3:47:50.364
RHETT: It's this from which you get
your strength, the red earth of Tara.

3:47:50.573 --> 3:47:54.242
GERALD: Land's the only thing that matters.
The only thing that lasts.

3:47:54.535 --> 3:47:57.579
ASHLEY: Something you love more
than me, though you may not know it.

3:47:57.872 --> 3:48:00.248
RHETT: --from which you get
your strength. Tara.

3:48:00.458 --> 3:48:02.376
GERALD:
Land's the only thing that matters.

3:48:02.543 --> 3:48:03.752
ASHLEY:
Something you love more.

3:48:04.003 --> 3:48:06.088
RHETT: --the red earth of Tara.
GERALD: Tara!

3:48:06.255 --> 3:48:07.756
ASHLEY: Tara!
RHETT: Tara!

3:48:10.218 --> 3:48:11.760
Tara!

3:48:12.762 --> 3:48:14.262
Home.

3:48:15.181 --> 3:48:17.015
I'll go home.

3:48:17.600 --> 3:48:20.602
And I'll think of some way
to get him back.

3:48:20.853 --> 3:48:25.982
After all, tomorrow is another day!

3:53:05.930 --> 3:53:07.931
