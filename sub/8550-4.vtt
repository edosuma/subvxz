WEBVTT

00:26.760 --> 00:27.828
STEVE?

00:27.895 --> 00:29.230
OOH!

00:42.009 --> 00:43.577
HARRIETTE.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.945
HARRIETTE.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.181
NO, CARL.
IT'S A WEEK NIGHT.

00:51.752 --> 00:54.054
HARRIETTE, WAKE UP.

00:54.122 --> 00:55.556
WHAT?

00:55.623 --> 00:57.958
STEVE URKEL
JUST WALKED
INTO OUR BEDROOM

00:58.025 --> 01:00.060
AND BOPPED ME
WITH A NEWSPAPER.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.064
CARL, YOU'RE DREAMING.
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

01:04.132 --> 01:05.133
BUT, HARRIETTE--

01:05.199 --> 01:06.934
I NEED EIGHT HOURS
OF SLEEP,

01:07.000 --> 01:08.536
AND I NEED THEM
IN A ROW!

01:08.602 --> 01:10.138
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.741
HARRIETTE.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.277
HARRIETTE.

01:51.379 --> 01:53.013
WILL YOU STOP
HITTING ME?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.215
I WANT TO SLEEP!

01:54.282 --> 01:55.683
HARRIETTE, LOOK.

02:13.401 --> 02:15.869
NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

02:15.936 --> 02:16.904
STEVE?

02:16.970 --> 02:18.539
WH--

02:21.074 --> 02:22.376
I'M GOING TO KILL
THAT KID.

02:22.443 --> 02:25.179
CARL, CARL, WAIT, WAIT.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.914
I THINK HE'S
SLEEPWALKING.

02:26.980 --> 02:28.316
REALLY?

02:31.151 --> 02:32.420
STEVE?

02:35.856 --> 02:36.790
I'M GOING TO--

02:36.857 --> 02:38.058
CARL, CARL, DON'T!

02:38.125 --> 02:39.693
IT'S DANGEROUS
TO WAKE A SLEEPWALKER.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.628
NO PROBLEM.

02:40.694 --> 02:44.332
I CAN KILL HIM
WITHOUT WAKING HIM UP.

02:44.398 --> 02:45.866
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.369
OH, YES--
I-- DO.

02:49.837 --> 02:50.771
SAFE AT LAST.

02:50.838 --> 02:54.007
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH THIS KID?

02:54.074 --> 02:55.042
LET ME GO!

02:55.108 --> 02:56.444
CARL, CARL!

02:56.510 --> 02:58.312
WOULD YOU LET ME GO?

03:08.989 --> 03:11.024
* IT'S A RARE CONDITION *

03:11.091 --> 03:12.560
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

03:12.626 --> 03:15.929
* TO READ ANY GOOD NEWS
ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

03:15.996 --> 03:19.467
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION
OF THE GRAND DESIGN *

03:19.533 --> 03:23.937
* SOME PEOPLE SAY
IS EVEN HARDER TO FIND *

03:24.004 --> 03:27.140
* WELL, THEN, THERE MUST BE
SOME MAGIC CLUE *

03:27.207 --> 03:31.445
* INSIDE
THESE GENTLE WALLS *

03:31.512 --> 03:34.715
* 'CAUSE ALL I SEE
IS A TOWER OF DREAMS *

03:34.782 --> 03:38.386
* REAL LOVE BURSTIN'
OUT OF EVERY SEAM *

03:39.587 --> 03:42.756
* AS DAYS GO BY *

03:42.823 --> 03:46.494
* WE'RE GONNA FILL
OUR HOUSE WITH HAPPINESS *

03:46.560 --> 03:49.697
* THE MOON MAY CRY *

03:49.763 --> 03:53.367
* WE'RE GONNA SMOTHER
THE BLUES WITH TENDERNESS *

03:53.434 --> 03:56.904
* AS DAYS GO BY *

03:56.970 --> 04:00.474
* THERE'S ROOM FOR YOU
ROOM FOR ME *

04:00.541 --> 04:04.345
* FOR GENTLE HEARTS
AN OPPORTUNITY *

04:04.412 --> 04:07.748
* AS DAYS GO BY *

04:07.815 --> 04:11.719
* IT'S THE BIGGER LOVE
OF THE FAMILY *

04:31.672 --> 04:33.273
AAH!

04:36.310 --> 04:37.611
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
BIG GUY?

04:37.678 --> 04:40.381
I JUST WANTED
TO GIVE YOU YOUR PAPER.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.417
STEVE,

04:43.484 --> 04:46.186
LATE LAST NIGHT
YOU WALKED INTO
OUR BEDROOM.

04:46.253 --> 04:49.990
IN YOUR HAND
WAS A ROLLED-UP
NEWSPAPER.

04:50.057 --> 04:52.025
AND YOU REPEATEDLY
HIT CARL

04:52.092 --> 04:53.927
OVER THE HEAD
WITH IT.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.996
LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

04:58.098 --> 05:01.268
I WALKED INTO YOUR BEDROOM
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT?

05:01.335 --> 05:02.370
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:02.436 --> 05:04.104
WITH A ROLLED-UP
NEWSPAPER.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.238
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.040
AND DID THIS.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.812
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:11.879 --> 05:14.615
OH, POPPYCOCK.

05:14.682 --> 05:17.818
WHY WOULD I BASH THE FATHER
OF THE WOMAN I LOVE?

05:17.885 --> 05:19.453
SORRY.
TOUCHING.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.692
STEVE, YOU WERE
SLEEPWALKING.

05:24.758 --> 05:27.795
HMM. THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN
WHY I WOKE UP THIS MORNING

05:27.861 --> 05:30.931
IN THE DAIRY CASE
AT THE 7-ELEVEN.

05:33.901 --> 05:34.835
WELL,

05:34.902 --> 05:37.137
APPARENTLY I REQUIRE
PROFESSIONAL HELP

05:37.204 --> 05:39.607
FROM A QUALIFIED
THERAPIST.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.274
CARL, I'M REALLY SORRY.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.478
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
I WAS DOING THIS.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.249
CARL! DON'T!

05:49.316 --> 05:50.951
NO, NO, DON'T!

06:02.095 --> 06:04.632
HOW MUCH LONGER
ARE THEY GOING TO BE
IN THAT KITCHEN?

06:04.698 --> 06:07.501
AS LONG AS IT TAKES.
CHILL OUT.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.205
DR. GOODRICH SAID HE CAN'T
PUT STEVE UNDER HYPNOSIS

06:12.272 --> 06:15.776
UNTIL HE UNDERSTANDS
HIS PSYCHOLOGICAL MAKEUP.

06:15.843 --> 06:16.944
THAT'S EASY--

06:17.010 --> 06:19.146
THE KID IS NUTSO.

06:19.212 --> 06:21.982
OH, CARL, DR. GOODRICH
WAS NICE ENOUGH
TO COME OVER HERE.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.518
SO LET'S JUST LEAVE
THE DIAGNOSIS UP TO HIM.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.153
AFTER ALL HE'S ONE
OF THE MOST BRILLIANT,

06:26.219 --> 06:28.622
AND HIGHLY RESPECTED
THERAPISTS IN THE COUNTRY.

06:28.689 --> 06:31.258
HE WILL DEFINITELY
HELP STEVE.

06:31.324 --> 06:33.393
AND THEN, WHEN I WAS 7,

06:33.461 --> 06:36.129
I STARTED STEALING
CANDY BARS.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.168
OF COURSE.
YOU WERE COMPENSATING,

06:41.234 --> 06:43.236
FOR A LACK OF ATTENTION
FROM YOUR MOTHER.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.772
A CRY FOR HELP?

06:44.838 --> 06:47.708
YES, AS YOU GREW OLDER
IT MANIFESTED IN OTHER WAYS.

06:47.775 --> 06:48.876
AND THAT
WOULD EXPLAIN

06:48.942 --> 06:51.044
YOUR COMPULSION
FOR NUDE SKYDIVING.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.949
YES!

06:56.016 --> 06:58.786
OH, YES!
THANK YOU!

07:01.655 --> 07:02.990
WE'RE READY NOW.

07:04.257 --> 07:07.094
STEVE, IF YOU'LL TAKE A SEAT,
WE'LL HYPNOTIZE YOU.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.529
ALRIGHTY.

07:08.596 --> 07:11.431
CAN YOU MAKE HIM
QUACK LIKE A DUCK

07:11.499 --> 07:13.233
EVERY TIME
THE PHONE RINGS?

07:13.300 --> 07:16.336
MS. CRAWFORD,
I AM A MEDICAL DOCTOR,

07:16.403 --> 07:18.071
NOT A CARNIVAL ACT.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.509
HE'S NOT GOING
TO MAKE HIM QUACK.

07:24.177 --> 07:25.278
READY, STEVE?

07:25.345 --> 07:26.814
GIVE IT YOUR BEST SHOT,

07:26.880 --> 07:29.983
BUT I GOTTA WARN YOU
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO HYPNOTIZE ME.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.184
OH?

07:31.251 --> 07:33.220
OH, YES, I'M FAR
TOO INTELLIGENT

07:33.286 --> 07:36.690
TO FALL FOR THE OLD
"KEEP YOUR EYE ON
THE WATCH" ROUTINE.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.458
ACTUALLY, THE HIGHER
THE INTELLIGENCE,

07:38.526 --> 07:40.293
THE EASIER THE HYPNOSIS.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.129
SO YOU SAY, BUT--

07:42.195 --> 07:43.797
OHH...

07:49.269 --> 07:50.704
NOW, STEVE--

07:50.771 --> 07:51.539
HMM?

07:51.605 --> 07:53.306
YOU ARE SITTING
IN A CHAIR

07:53.373 --> 07:55.075
IN THE WINSLOW
LIVING ROOM.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.510
AHH.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.746
YOU'RE HERE WITH
WONDERFUL FRIENDS.

08:01.214 --> 08:02.482
HI, SUGAR.

08:02.550 --> 08:04.785
ESTELLE, MY BELLE.

08:06.419 --> 08:08.055
HI, STEVE.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.256
RACHEL,

08:09.322 --> 08:11.692
THE WORLD'S MOST
BEAUTIFUL BOSS.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.029
AHEM.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.030
HI, STEVE.

08:17.097 --> 08:18.632
GRRR!

08:21.301 --> 08:23.604
HMM.
INTERESTING.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.874
STEVE, IT'S ME, CARL.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.075
GRRR!

08:30.110 --> 08:31.178
BIG GUY.

08:31.244 --> 08:32.646
GRRR!

08:39.587 --> 08:41.589
DOC, I THINK
HE'S MAD AT ME.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.791
YES. THE QUESTION IS WHY.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.694
STEVE, WHY ARE YOU
ANGRY AT CARL?

08:48.161 --> 08:49.763
BECAUSE HE HATES ME,

08:49.830 --> 08:51.531
AND HE WANTS ME
TO MOVE AWAY

08:51.599 --> 08:53.634
AND NEVER COME BACK.

09:09.216 --> 09:10.383
IS HE MAKING
THIS UP?

09:10.450 --> 09:11.885
NO, NO.

09:11.952 --> 09:14.722
MOST PEOPLE UNDER
HYPNOSIS DON'T LIE.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.758
BUT I NEVER TOLD STEVE
THAT I HATE HIM.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.594
HE GOT THAT IDEA
SOMEHOW.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.295
CAN YOU FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED?

09:22.362 --> 09:23.731
WE CAN TRY.

09:23.797 --> 09:27.100
STEVE, I WANT YOU
TO GO BACK IN TIME.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.368
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

09:28.435 --> 09:29.770
YES.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.140
I'M--

09:33.206 --> 09:35.575
I'M BEING BORN.

09:38.145 --> 09:40.313
MY HEAD POPS OUT.

09:41.682 --> 09:44.317
I CAN SEE MY DAD.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.920
WHOA! I'M BEING
PUSHED BACK IN!

09:57.264 --> 09:58.331
UH, STEVE?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.100
STEVE?

10:00.901 --> 10:02.736
STEVE.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.706
YOU WENT TOO FAR BACK.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.074
GO BACK TO THE TIME

10:07.140 --> 10:10.043
WHEN YOU FELT ANGRY
AT CARL WINSLOW.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.712
GRRR!

10:13.747 --> 10:17.317
IT--IT WAS ABOUT
A MONTH AGO,

10:17.384 --> 10:20.353
A COUPLE OF HOURS
BEFORE THE COSTUME PARTY.

10:21.521 --> 10:23.023
COSTUME PARTY.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.926
COSTUME PARTY.

10:30.664 --> 10:34.634
LAURA, ARE MAXINE'S
PARENTS CHAPERONING
THIS PARTY TONIGHT?

10:34.702 --> 10:36.303
OH, NO.
THEY'RE OUT OF TOWN.

10:36.369 --> 10:39.940
BUT DON'T WORRY,
THREE KIDS ARE DRESSING UP
AS RESPONSIBLE ADULTS.

10:41.909 --> 10:44.477
JUST KIDDING.
MAX' PARENTS
WILL BE THERE.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.413
GOOD. AND IF I
WERE YOU,

10:46.479 --> 10:49.817
I WOULDN'T TEASE ME
WHILE I'M HOLDING
A NEEDLE.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.353
YES!

10:53.420 --> 10:54.587
WHAT IS IT, DAD?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.690
I FINALLY FINISHED
MY CLIPPER SHIP.

10:56.757 --> 11:00.527
IT TOOK FOUR
AND A HALF MONTHS,
BUT I DID IT.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.062
OH.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.865
"OH"?

11:04.932 --> 11:06.533
THAT'S ALL YOU CAN SAY?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.769
OH, IT'S NICE, DADDY.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.572
HEAR YE, HEAR YE.

11:12.639 --> 11:16.109
MAKE WAY FOR SIR STEVE,
THE EARL OF URKEL.

11:20.914 --> 11:23.050

11:29.890 --> 11:32.059
HAIL WINSLOWS, WELL MET.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.995

11:36.429 --> 11:38.065
OH, VERY WELL.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.585
SQUIRES,

11:58.651 --> 12:00.888
MAKE SURE WINIFRED
IS WELL FED.

12:02.322 --> 12:04.724
COME ON, HORSEY.
GIDDYUP, GIDDYUP.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.894
NO, GIDDYOUT, GIDDYOUT.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.596
BOSS BOAT, BIG GUY.

12:09.662 --> 12:10.764
LOOK OUT.

12:10.831 --> 12:13.033
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
STAY AWAY FROM IT.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.037
MILADY,

12:17.838 --> 12:20.740
THY BEAUTY
DOTH STUN ME.

12:22.142 --> 12:25.078
THE BIRDS WARBLE PRAISES
OF THY LOVELINESS.

12:25.145 --> 12:28.181
TRULY THEY DOTH NOT
DOETH THEE JUSTICE.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.820
OKAY, WHO TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE PARTY?

12:32.886 --> 12:33.987
FREDDY MAU-MAU.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.289
WHAT? HE SWORE
HE WOULDN'T TELL.

12:36.356 --> 12:37.557
COME ON.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.127
HE'D SELL HIS SISTER
FOR A MARS BAR.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.665
STEVE, I'M NOT GOING
TO THE PARTY WITH YOU.

12:45.732 --> 12:47.901
OKAY, I'LL MEET YOU THERE.

12:47.968 --> 12:50.537
BUT SAVE A DANCE FOR ME.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.913
OH, WHERE'S MY LANCE?

13:03.616 --> 13:04.952
OH!

13:06.219 --> 13:07.454
AAH!

13:24.237 --> 13:26.139
DID I DO THAT?

13:30.277 --> 13:32.913
I-I-I'M REALLY
SORRY, CARL.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.285
STEVE...

13:39.786 --> 13:42.089
I'M VERY UPSET
RIGHT NOW,

13:42.155 --> 13:44.958
SO I THINK THAT YOU
JUST BETTER LEAVE. OKAY?

13:45.025 --> 13:46.559
OH, Y-Y-YES, SIR.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.228
MM-HMM.
YES, SIR.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.303
LOOK AT THIS.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.570
WOULD YOU LOOK?

13:58.906 --> 14:01.808
IN PIECES.
MY BOAT, MY POOR BOAT.

14:01.875 --> 14:03.743
CAN YOU FIX IT, DAD?

14:03.810 --> 14:05.812
NO.

14:05.879 --> 14:07.680
FOUR AND A HALF
MONTHS OF WORK,

14:07.747 --> 14:09.416
AND NOW THIS IS JUNK.

14:11.684 --> 14:15.188
YOU KNOW,
I HATE THAT KID.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.991
I WISH HE WOULD
JUST MOVE AWAY

14:18.058 --> 14:21.194
AND NEVER,
NEVER COME BACK.

14:21.261 --> 14:22.595
YEAH.

14:33.941 --> 14:36.944
WELL, HEY, I WAS UPSET.

14:37.010 --> 14:39.346
I MEAN, I WORKED HARD
ON THAT CLIPPER SHIP.

14:39.412 --> 14:42.782
I DIDN'T REALIZE
HE WAS IN THE ROOM
WHEN I SAID IT.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.351
WELL, HE WAS.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.685
AND IT HURT HIM.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.887
WAY TO GO, CARL.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.826
STEVE, WHEN I
SNAP MY FINGERS,
YOU'LL AWAKEN.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.862
YOU WILL REMEMBER
EVERYTHING YOU SAID.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.297
YOU WILL NOT SLEEP-WALK,

14:57.364 --> 15:00.667
BECAUSE YOU WILL NOT BE
SUPPRESSING PAINFUL MEMORIES.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.569
3, 2, 1.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.140
DARN! I CAN NEVER DO THAT.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.076
[SNAP]

15:09.142 --> 15:10.677
SEE? I TOLD YOU,
DOC.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.613
YOU JUST CAN'T
HYPNOTIZE ME.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.248
I'M AFRAID I DID, STEVE.

15:15.315 --> 15:18.118
REMEMBER WHAT CARL SAID
BEFORE THE COSTUME PARTY?

15:25.959 --> 15:28.261
I MOST CERTAINLY DO.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.876
WAIT A MINUTE.
HARRIETTE--

15:43.943 --> 15:45.445
WHERE ARE
YOU GUYS GOING?

15:45.512 --> 15:47.847
I'M GOING TO CHECK
YOUR BIRTH CERTIFICATE

15:47.914 --> 15:50.417
AND MAKE SURE
YOU'RE REALLY MY SON.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.125
GEE, DOC..

15:58.191 --> 15:59.959
EVERYBODY'S MAD AT ME.

16:00.027 --> 16:02.729
A NORMAL PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTION.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.032
BUT I-I FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT IT.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.699
NORMAL AS WELL.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.501
WELL, WHAT I OWE YOU, DOC?

16:08.568 --> 16:11.304
FORGET IT, I WOULDN'T TOUCH
YOUR FILTHY MONEY.

16:23.216 --> 16:25.018
YEAH. OKAY, SEE YOU SOON.

16:25.085 --> 16:27.287
BYE, NOW.

16:27.354 --> 16:28.288
GOOD NEWS.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.123
I JUST TALKED TO STEVE.

16:30.190 --> 16:31.458
DID YOU APOLOGIZE?

16:31.524 --> 16:34.594
BETTER--I ASKED HIM OVER
TO APOLOGIZE IN PERSON.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.064
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.299
I'LL TELL STEVE
I DON'T REALLY HATE HIM.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.734
I'LL TELL HIM HOW TERRIFIC
I THINK HE IS.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.671
YOU KNOW,
LAY IT ON REAL THICK.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.707
[HUMMING]

16:49.709 --> 16:50.977
HELLO, HARRIETTE.

16:51.044 --> 16:52.479
SERGEANT WINSLOW.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.615
WHAT IS THAT?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.417
MY POLYGRAPH.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.552
YOU BROUGHT
A LIE DETECTOR?

17:00.553 --> 17:01.588
CORRECT.

17:02.889 --> 17:04.091
WHY?

17:04.157 --> 17:06.126
OH, COME ON.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.230
WHO DO I LOOK LIKE,
HERBIE THE HICK?

17:12.665 --> 17:13.833
WHY IT WOULD BE EASY

17:13.900 --> 17:16.269
FOR YOU TO SAY
YOU DON'T HATE ME.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.038
YOU COULD EVEN
SAY I'M TERRIFIC.

17:19.106 --> 17:21.174
YOU KNOW, LAY IT ON
REAL THICK.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.745
OH, I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.947
WELL, MY LITTLE BUDDY HERE

17:28.014 --> 17:30.950
IS GONNA MAKE SURE
THAT YOU DON'T.

17:31.017 --> 17:33.786
OKAY, LET'S GET THIS
OVER WITH.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.425
NOW, CARL,

17:38.491 --> 17:40.560
IT'S ONLY FAIR
TO WARN YOU

17:40.627 --> 17:43.830
THAT I HAVE IMPROVED
THIS PARTICULAR
POLYGRAPH.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.632
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
IMPROVED?

17:45.698 --> 17:50.403
I'VE ADJUSTED IT
SO THAT EVERY TIME
YOU TELL A LIE,

17:50.470 --> 17:54.807
YOU WILL
RECEIVE A SLIGHT
ELECTRIC SHOCK.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.043
FORGET IT!

17:57.110 --> 17:59.446
WELL, WHAT'S THE
MATTER, CARL?

17:59.512 --> 18:02.081
YOU'LL BE FINE
AS LONG AS YOU
TELL THE TRUTH.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.083
NO FIBBY, NO SHOCKY.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.586
THAT'S RIGHT.

18:06.653 --> 18:10.257
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
TO HIDE, DO YOU, CARL?

18:10.990 --> 18:13.760
OKAY, OKAY.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.128
WELL, GO AHEAD.

18:15.195 --> 18:18.598
CARL WINSLOW
IS AN HONEST MAN.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.200
OKAY.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.834
HERE WE GO.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.671
[BUZZING]

18:25.938 --> 18:27.274
HEH HEH HEH.

18:30.076 --> 18:31.077
ALRIGHT.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.112
IS CARL WINSLOW
YOUR REAL NAME?

18:33.180 --> 18:35.148
YES, IT IS.

18:35.215 --> 18:37.217
ARE YOU
HAPPILY MARRIED?

18:41.221 --> 18:42.755
YES, I AM.

18:46.159 --> 18:47.827
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

18:47.894 --> 18:48.861
35.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.297
[ZAP]

18:53.233 --> 18:55.502
UH, UH, 38, 38.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.636
I'M 38.

18:56.703 --> 18:57.504
ALRIGHT.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.772
NOW YOU KNOW
I MEAN BUSINESS.

19:02.442 --> 19:06.579
NOW, LET'S GET
TO THE HEART
OF THE MATTER.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.281
CARL WINSLOW,

19:08.348 --> 19:10.149
DO YOU HATE ME?

19:15.121 --> 19:16.456
NO.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.859
WELL, ARE YOU CRAZY
ABOUT ME?

19:19.926 --> 19:20.860
SURE.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.262
[ZAP]

19:25.565 --> 19:27.600
WELL, DO YOU
LIKE ME A LOT?

19:27.667 --> 19:28.768
ABSOLUTELY.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.837
[ZAP]

19:32.872 --> 19:35.575
WELL, DO YOU EVEN
CARE ABOUT ME AT ALL?

19:38.745 --> 19:40.847
YES, I DO.

19:40.913 --> 19:44.484
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED?
IT WAS WORKING GREAT.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.956
STEVE, YOUR MACHINE
IS NOT BROKEN.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.758
I REALLY DO
CARE ABOUT YOU.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.060
YEAH?

19:54.126 --> 19:55.562
YEAH.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.266
LOOK, LET'S TALK
FOR A MOMENT.

19:59.332 --> 20:03.936
WHEN YOU SMASHED MY SHIP,
I FLIPPED OUT.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.406
I SAID WHAT I SAID
OUT OF ANGER.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.842
THAT DOESN'T EXCUSE IT,
BUT I HOPE IT EXPLAINS IT.

20:12.279 --> 20:13.513
YOU KNOW THE SAYING,

20:13.580 --> 20:15.548
"STICKS AND STONES
MAY BREAK MY BONES,

20:15.615 --> 20:17.884
BUT WORDS WILL
NEVER HURT ME"?

20:17.950 --> 20:19.051
SURE.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.688
WELL, IT'S WRONG.
WORDS DO HURT.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.956
THEY SURE DO.

20:25.458 --> 20:29.429
YOU KNOW,
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

20:29.496 --> 20:31.831
I WAS A TAD OVERWEIGHT.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.834
[ZAP]

20:41.941 --> 20:44.411
OKAY, I WAS FAT. OKAY?

20:48.548 --> 20:54.821
BUT A LOT OF MEAN KIDS
SAID SOME REALLY MEAN THINGS

20:54.887 --> 20:56.956
THAT HURT A LOT.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.491
YEAH.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.296
STEVE,

21:03.363 --> 21:05.832
WHEN I SAID
THAT I HATED YOU,

21:05.898 --> 21:08.335
I SAID IT OUT OF ANGER,

21:08.401 --> 21:10.903
AND I HONESTLY
DID NOT MEAN IT.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.372
AND I'M SORRY.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.143
APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

21:17.209 --> 21:18.845
THANKS, BIG GUY.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.286
WELL, HARRIETTE,

21:27.354 --> 21:29.589
EVERYTHING WORKED OUT
JUST FINE.

21:29.656 --> 21:31.691
I'M GLAD.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.393
SO, CARL...

21:33.460 --> 21:36.896
HOW MANY WOMEN WERE YOU
SERIOUS ABOUT BEFORE ME?

21:38.898 --> 21:39.866
NONE, DEAR.

21:39.932 --> 21:41.668

21:44.371 --> 21:45.572
UH, THREE.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.340

21:47.407 --> 21:49.676

THINGS OFF OF ME!

21:49.742 --> 21:51.644

TELL THE TRUTH.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.553
OH, HURRY UP!
