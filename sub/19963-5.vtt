00:48.215 --> 00:49.214
Cassandra:
Fitzherbert!

00:49.216 --> 00:51.316
(gasps)

00:51.318 --> 00:53.185
(sighs) Not again.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.154
Eugene:
I don't know what
you're so upset about!

00:55.156 --> 00:57.589
Oh, wait, "know"
was the wrong choice of words.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.225
I meant, I don't care
what you're so upset about.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.929
(sighs deeply)
Hey, guys!
Everything okay?

01:03.931 --> 01:06.265
I couldn't help
but overhear--

01:06.267 --> 01:08.434
Not only did you take
my halberd without asking,

01:08.436 --> 01:11.937
you got your disgusting
hair all over it!

01:11.939 --> 01:13.439
How dare you!

01:13.441 --> 01:16.341
First of all, I did not
touch your halberd.

01:16.343 --> 01:18.444
Second of all,
what is a halberd?

01:19.680 --> 01:22.047
Oh! Oh, a halberd.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.348
Okay, fine, you got me,

01:23.350 --> 01:24.950
but check out this shave.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.585
Smooth as a baby's bottom.

01:26.587 --> 01:28.353
-Try a monkey's.
-Rapunzel: Okay.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.923
Okay, everyone,
let's take a deep,

01:30.925 --> 01:32.858
calming,
cleansing breath.

01:32.860 --> 01:35.127
(inhales, exhales)

01:35.129 --> 01:38.097
To be fair, I asked
several times if
I could use that thing.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.432
And I said, "No" every time.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.769
Which shouldn't matter,
because we both know
I don't listen to you.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.404
Guys, come on.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.573
This is ridiculous.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.576
Eugene, a halberd
should only be handled
by a skilled warrior.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.644
Hello! Skilled warrior!

01:52.646 --> 01:56.648
You forgot Flynn Rider
has handled plenty of weapons.

01:56.650 --> 01:58.383
-(shatters)
-Oh.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.052
Ha!

02:00.054 --> 02:01.820
Way to go, Eugene.

02:01.822 --> 02:03.755
That-- that's a faulty
halberd right there.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.991
Let's not panic!
I mean, it is--

02:05.993 --> 02:08.660
was my dad's
favorite, irreplaceable,

02:08.662 --> 02:11.096
one of a kind,
most favorite vase, but--

02:11.098 --> 02:12.998
Hey, I have an idea, Eugene.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.733
Why not just steal
him another one?

02:14.735 --> 02:16.935
Oh! Oh, wait, wait.

02:16.937 --> 02:18.070
You can't!

02:18.072 --> 02:20.139
This is a one of a kind vase.

02:20.141 --> 02:21.306
(chuckles)

02:21.308 --> 02:24.843
Of course you would
pronounce it "vahz,"
Cassandra.

02:24.845 --> 02:26.512
Yeah, yeah,
"vayce," "vahz."

02:26.514 --> 02:29.515
Either way, it'll be
the first thing the king sees

02:29.517 --> 02:31.316
when he sits down
for dinner tonight,

02:31.318 --> 02:33.285
or doesn't see.

02:33.287 --> 02:36.421
You just love making me
look like an idiot
in front of the king, don't ya?

02:36.423 --> 02:39.825
Nope, you do a perfect job
of that all on your own.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.260
Thank you.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.661
Wait a minute!

02:44.832 --> 02:47.366
Rapunzel:
I can't take it
anymore, Pascal.

02:47.368 --> 02:51.436
I mean, why can't Cass
and Eugene just get along?

02:51.438 --> 02:55.474
They're both caring,
supportive,
very considerate people...

02:55.476 --> 02:57.876
who somehow got us
to clean up their mess.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.311
(squeaks)

02:59.313 --> 03:00.846
I bet they would be
great friends

03:00.848 --> 03:02.548
if they just stopped
fighting long enough

03:02.550 --> 03:04.349
to spend some
quality time together.

03:04.351 --> 03:05.551
-(grumbles)
-(Rapunzel gasps)

03:05.553 --> 03:07.286
Wait a minute,
wait a minute,
wait a minute!

03:07.288 --> 03:08.620
That's it! That's it!

03:08.622 --> 03:11.557
I will make them
spend time together.

03:11.559 --> 03:12.991
-Come on.
-(Pascal squeaks)

03:12.993 --> 03:14.193
¶ ¶

03:17.531 --> 03:18.730
(sighs)

03:19.900 --> 03:21.967
(metal scraping)

03:29.009 --> 03:30.576
What's this?

03:30.578 --> 03:31.777
(chirps)

03:40.321 --> 03:41.653
Eugene:
I'm telling you, Stan!

03:41.655 --> 03:45.190
The handlebar mustache
is so passé.

03:45.192 --> 03:48.393
Today, it's all about
the goatee.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.095
-You know what I mean?
-(Pascal chirps)

03:50.097 --> 03:51.396
You see--

03:51.398 --> 03:54.866
Just a second, frog,
I'm making a point.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.203
Oh! Hey, easy! What?
What? What is it?

03:58.205 --> 03:59.605
A note from Cassandra?

03:59.607 --> 04:01.540
If this is another
eviction letter,

04:01.542 --> 04:03.108
I am going to lose it!

04:03.110 --> 04:05.010
She does not have
the authority for that!

04:05.012 --> 04:06.612
I checked!

04:08.015 --> 04:11.416
Hmm, well, this ought
to be interesting.

04:11.418 --> 04:12.918
(rats squeaking)

04:19.693 --> 04:23.295
Okay, it's a grim place
to offer an apology,

04:23.297 --> 04:25.697
but then again,
this is Cassandra
we're talking about.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.099
-Cassandra: I'm sorry.
-(yelps)

04:27.101 --> 04:30.202
Did you just say I was going
to offer you an apology?

04:30.204 --> 04:31.403
Yeah!

04:31.405 --> 04:34.406
You said in your note
you wanted to say sorry.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.607
I didn't write you a note.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.541
You wrote me a note.

04:36.543 --> 04:37.709
-(door closes, locks)
-Huh?

04:39.446 --> 04:41.313
Hey! What are you doing?

04:41.315 --> 04:43.615
Time for the game to begin.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.617
Game? What are you
talking about?

04:45.619 --> 04:46.551
Don't you see?

04:46.553 --> 04:48.453
I wrote the letters.

04:48.455 --> 04:51.089
They were merely a ruse
to lure you both down here.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.959
What? You can't
just lock us in here.

04:55.663 --> 04:56.795
(chuckles)

04:56.797 --> 04:58.830
Oh, I can, and I have,

04:58.832 --> 05:02.567
and I'm afraid your only way
to escape is to work together,

05:02.569 --> 05:05.671
to solve a puzzle
of my own design.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.673
What puzzle?

05:07.675 --> 05:12.077
Within these walls,
you will find a series
of strategically placed,

05:12.079 --> 05:14.479
increasingly difficult clues,

05:14.481 --> 05:18.583
each one more unfathomably
perplexing than the last.

05:18.585 --> 05:21.787
Put them together,
and you're free to go.

05:21.789 --> 05:22.921
Fail?

05:22.923 --> 05:27.092
And this prison cell
will become your new home.

05:27.094 --> 05:29.828
(cackles evilly)

05:31.365 --> 05:33.532
Oh, and I made
you guys cookies.

05:35.102 --> 05:37.903
What are we, twelve?

05:47.481 --> 05:49.348
Cassandra:
Listen, this is
all your fault.

05:49.350 --> 05:50.682
Eugene:
Oh, please!

05:50.684 --> 05:52.984
You know darn well
that my only fault

05:52.986 --> 05:55.554
is that I have no faults!

05:55.556 --> 05:58.290
Recognize that voice?

05:58.292 --> 06:00.192
Sounds like our old friend.

06:02.629 --> 06:05.864
(humming)

06:06.900 --> 06:08.233
(sighs)

06:08.235 --> 06:09.534
Say what you will, Pascal,

06:09.536 --> 06:12.037
but sticking those two together
to work out their differences

06:12.039 --> 06:14.706
has its advantages.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.775
I mean, do you hear that?

06:19.413 --> 06:21.913
That is the sound
of peace and quiet.

06:21.915 --> 06:26.051
Ha! I can finally
hear myself think.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.253
I think I want
to paint something.

06:28.255 --> 06:30.589
Ah! I like the way you think.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.557
(squeaks)

06:34.261 --> 06:35.394
Relax.

06:35.396 --> 06:39.030
I'm sure Eugene and Cass
are doing just fine.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.767
(grunts, groans)

06:41.769 --> 06:43.335
(sighs)

06:46.573 --> 06:49.608
(ticking, clinking)

06:51.612 --> 06:54.546
So annoying!

06:54.548 --> 06:58.116
I know!
All these delicious
cookies, and no milk?

06:58.118 --> 06:59.785
No, wait, she packed milk!

07:05.759 --> 07:07.192
(sighs)

07:07.194 --> 07:09.394
Unbelievable!

07:09.396 --> 07:10.896
Did you eat
all the cookies?

07:10.898 --> 07:12.531
I'm not a pig, Cassandra.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.466
I ate all of your cookies.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.700
I'm saving mine for later.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.068
Huh!

07:17.070 --> 07:19.037
You are nothing
but a self-serving,

07:19.039 --> 07:21.306
inconsiderate,
arrogant freeloader.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.542
Ah! You know I could
rattle off insulting adjectives

07:23.544 --> 07:24.910
describing
your personality too,

07:24.912 --> 07:27.379
but to do so
would imply that you
actually have a personality,

07:27.381 --> 07:28.980
and I just wouldn't feel
right about doing that!

07:31.652 --> 07:33.819
Hey, hold on, wait,
don't-- don't eat that!

07:36.256 --> 07:39.124
Oh! Go ahead, but it's got
my milk drool on it.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.559
Quick! Let me see the others.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.793
What are you doing?

07:41.795 --> 07:45.730
Cassandra:
X6? Y15?

07:45.732 --> 07:48.433
I think these
are coordinates for a grid!

07:48.435 --> 07:50.902
Rapunzel must have
hidden the key behind
a loose brick in the wall,

07:50.904 --> 07:53.638
and these cookies
tell us which one.

07:53.640 --> 07:56.274
So, just for clarification,

07:56.276 --> 07:58.376
I can eat the cookies
now or no?

08:02.749 --> 08:04.282
Yes!

08:04.284 --> 08:06.651
That's it?
That's just a rusty spring!

08:06.653 --> 08:08.820
And on your first guess too.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.089
Wait, there's more.

08:11.091 --> 08:12.524
It's another clue.

08:12.526 --> 08:14.259
"This one is easy.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.261
"Just follow my lead."

08:16.263 --> 08:18.697
Follow her lead? How?

08:18.699 --> 08:20.832
She locked us in here,
this makes no sense.

08:20.834 --> 08:25.103
That's because we're not
supposed to follow her "leed."

08:25.105 --> 08:27.706
We're supposed
to follow her "led."

08:27.708 --> 08:32.110
Hmm, different words,
same spelling.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.845
Ah-ha!

08:38.785 --> 08:40.318
Don't worry, kid.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.487
You're not the first person
to match wits with this baby,

08:42.489 --> 08:44.689
and come off looking
like a total chump.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.625
(sighs)

08:46.627 --> 08:48.527
In fact, you might say
making people

08:48.529 --> 08:51.463
look like chumps
is kind of my spécialité.

08:51.465 --> 08:53.899
-(grunts)
-Patience, brother.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.300
Our time will come.

09:02.342 --> 09:03.975
(straining)

09:09.049 --> 09:11.616
-Whoa. Whoa!
-Eugene: Ow!

09:19.760 --> 09:22.494
Cassandra:
Look! There's another clue.

09:22.496 --> 09:24.062
I've been looking for this!

09:26.333 --> 09:29.534
"This is your final clue,
so pick up the pace.

09:29.536 --> 09:32.337
"You'll find the last treasure
in the same spot

09:32.339 --> 09:34.739
"you find your face?"

09:34.741 --> 09:37.242
Hey there, looking good.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.743
Hey! I was using that!

09:38.745 --> 09:40.979
Ugh, another useless item.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.183
Ho, ho, ho.

09:45.185 --> 09:46.618
Well done!

09:46.620 --> 09:48.887
You've discovered
the castle's junk drawer.

09:48.889 --> 09:51.289
Me? You were
part of this too!

09:51.291 --> 09:53.959
Oh, no! Don't stir me
into your failure stew!

09:53.961 --> 09:56.861
I was fine
to sit here eating
delicious X and Y cookies

09:56.863 --> 09:58.196
until Rapunzel gave up
and let us out.

09:58.198 --> 10:00.799
And that's just
like you, isn't it?

10:00.801 --> 10:03.935
Sit back and let things
fall right into your lap.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.303
What's that
supposed to mean?

10:05.305 --> 10:07.706
Oh, come on! You know
exactly what it means!

10:07.708 --> 10:09.975
Inmate:
Hey, Pretty Boy, Bowl Cut!

10:09.977 --> 10:13.078
Why don't you two
scud buckets pipe down?

10:13.080 --> 10:15.080
Why don't you mind
your own business?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.448
Ooh!

10:16.450 --> 10:18.650
"Mind my own business."

10:18.652 --> 10:21.920
Is that some kind
of comeback,
Lady Frowns-A-Lot?

10:21.922 --> 10:24.322
-(growls)
-Whoa, whoa, Cassandra.

10:24.324 --> 10:25.790
Let me handle this.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.926
Look at that!

10:27.928 --> 10:30.762
Fancy Boots has got
something to say!

10:30.764 --> 10:34.399
Name calling?
Come on, we're better
than that, aren't we?

10:34.401 --> 10:37.002
Sure, we could sit here
and make fun of each other.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.404
Tease Cassandra
for her chronic joylessness,

10:39.406 --> 10:41.606
or me for my
uncommonly good looks,

10:41.608 --> 10:43.842
or you for your
poor dental hygiene,

10:43.844 --> 10:45.977
tragic fashion sense,
robust body odor,

10:45.979 --> 10:49.814
and what are clearly
woefully misguided
life-decision-making skills,

10:49.816 --> 10:52.083
but do you really want
to go down that road?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.986
Mmm, I guess not.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.691
Rapunzel:
I can't believe
how much I can get done

10:59.693 --> 11:00.992
with just a little quiet.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.667
-Some game, huh?
-Yep.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.871
So, Cass, let me
ask you something.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.873
-What's your deal?
-What do you mean?

11:14.875 --> 11:17.876
I mean, you know,
other than being
a venomous cobra woman

11:17.878 --> 11:19.844
who has to follow
my girlfriend everywhere,

11:19.846 --> 11:22.347
-I don't know the first
thing about you.
-So?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.215
So, as I see it,

11:24.217 --> 11:25.850
you always make fun of my past,

11:25.852 --> 11:28.620
it's only fair I know
something about yours.

11:28.622 --> 11:31.556
-Plus we have nothing but time.
-What do you wanna know?

11:31.558 --> 11:33.725
I don't know,
what are your hopes?

11:33.727 --> 11:36.961
Your dreams?
Is there a venomous
cobra man in your life?

11:36.963 --> 11:39.197
(laughing)
Cobra man, no.

11:39.199 --> 11:42.534
Besides, I-- I don't
have time for dreams.

11:42.536 --> 11:45.036
"Don't have time for dreams?"

11:45.038 --> 11:48.073
Honey, you are hanging out
with the wrong princess.

11:48.075 --> 11:51.476
My dad taught me
at a very young age
to focus on the here and now.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.044
Yeah, wow.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.314
Being raised by
the Captain of the Guards
musta been a real treat.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.383
He's a good man,
and he taught me a lot.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.185
He showed me how
to defend myself,

12:00.187 --> 12:02.020
how to take on responsibility,

12:02.022 --> 12:04.222
how to earn my keep.

12:04.224 --> 12:07.992
Besides, I don't remember
my real parents, so,

12:07.994 --> 12:09.928
I got nothing to compare
him to, anyway.

12:09.930 --> 12:13.498
Yeah, I don't remember
mine either.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.934
I used to imagine they
were swashbuckling explorers

12:15.936 --> 12:18.436
searching the world
for treasure,
and once they found it

12:18.438 --> 12:22.607
they'd... come back
and get me.

12:22.609 --> 12:25.410
It's dumb, I know.
How about you?

12:25.412 --> 12:27.946
I mean, you ever imagine
what your parents were like?

12:31.051 --> 12:33.952
You know what?
I don't really want to
discuss this with you, Eugene.

12:35.122 --> 12:38.089
Okay, fine,
I'll just shut up then.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.626
You know, just when I think
I start to see a glimmer

12:41.628 --> 12:43.962
of a speck
of a pinprick of a soul,

12:43.964 --> 12:47.098
you flip your ice
switch back on.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.100
Stop trying to pry into my life.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.136
I wasn't prying.

12:51.138 --> 12:55.140
Wait a minute, that's it, pry!

12:55.142 --> 12:58.510
We're supposed to build
a jack with this stuff
and pry the door open.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.379
See, this piece
faces upwards,

13:01.381 --> 13:03.114
and then you add
this part to the top.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.516
Yes, brilliant!

13:07.487 --> 13:10.054
Cass, oh, you made it!

13:10.056 --> 13:12.157
See? Oh, I am so glad

13:12.159 --> 13:13.958
you and Eugene
found a way to work to--

13:13.960 --> 13:15.093
(Pascal squeaks)

13:15.095 --> 13:16.394
Whoa, Frideborg.

13:16.396 --> 13:18.096
I am sorry.

13:18.098 --> 13:20.131
Ah, I thought that
you were Cassandra,

13:20.133 --> 13:23.735
but not that I'm not happy
to see you, Frideborg.

13:25.672 --> 13:28.640
I think you're terrific,
by the way.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.977
Did you-- did you
change your hair?

13:35.148 --> 13:37.448
No? Nothing's different?

13:37.450 --> 13:39.083
Huh.

13:39.085 --> 13:42.320
Well, I have to go
over there now.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.829
(Pascal squeaks)

13:50.831 --> 13:53.798
Huh? Oh, relax, Pascal.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.133
I can handle this.

13:55.135 --> 13:58.636
Oh, yeah!

13:58.638 --> 14:00.505
I see what all
the fuss is about.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.140
No, this is fun!

14:02.142 --> 14:04.309
(grunting)

14:04.311 --> 14:06.344
Duck! Spin!

14:06.346 --> 14:09.080
-Thrust! Uh-oh.
-(thud)

14:16.890 --> 14:18.623
Alright, that should do it.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.191
Here, let me try.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.561
No! No, no, no,
that's too far!

14:23.563 --> 14:25.196
Leverage, Cassandra.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.065
It's all about the leverage.

14:27.067 --> 14:29.033
I know what I'm doing.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.169
No, you don't!

14:31.171 --> 14:33.972
Cut it out!

14:33.974 --> 14:35.073
You cut it out!

14:35.075 --> 14:36.507
The jack was my idea!

14:36.509 --> 14:38.643
Ugh, "my idea."

14:38.645 --> 14:40.245
"Me, me, me."

14:40.247 --> 14:42.146
It's always all about you.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.983
Okay, let's make it
about you than.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.184
"I'm Cassandra,

14:46.186 --> 14:48.253
"and I can't stand Eugene,

14:48.255 --> 14:50.521
"because he's smarter than me,
has better teeth,

14:50.523 --> 14:52.257
"and doesn't use
the word 'vahz.'"

14:52.259 --> 14:55.093
Ugh! You're making it
about you again!

14:55.095 --> 14:57.228
That's because I'm
far more interesting!

14:59.933 --> 15:01.065
No!

15:02.102 --> 15:03.301
(grunts)

15:04.905 --> 15:06.237
Eugene:
Oh, great!

15:06.239 --> 15:07.906
You lost my comb!

15:07.908 --> 15:10.241
-That was the first
thing I ever stole.
-(snickering)

15:10.243 --> 15:13.111
-I had it re-engraved
and everything.
-Looks like it's our lucky day.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.049
Woo-hoo!

15:18.051 --> 15:19.918
Take that to the rose garden!

15:24.591 --> 15:26.124
Yeah, you're right.

15:26.126 --> 15:27.358
It has been a long time.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.760
We-- we should check on them.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.081
Don't give me that look.

15:33.082 --> 15:35.866
This... absolutely
doesn't mean my plan
didn't work, Pascal.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.203
(whistling)

15:45.445 --> 15:48.112
Worked like a charm.

15:50.283 --> 15:51.783
(cell unlocks)

15:51.785 --> 15:53.284
Sideburns:
Time for a little payback.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.421
Ah, Blondie.

15:56.423 --> 15:58.423
Finally-- oh!

15:58.425 --> 15:59.891
Hello, Rider.

15:59.893 --> 16:01.326
That's unfortunate.

16:04.631 --> 16:06.230
-Friends of yours?
-Sideburns!

16:06.232 --> 16:08.833
Long time, no sneer!
You look good!

16:08.835 --> 16:11.069
The moisture in
the dungeon has done

16:11.071 --> 16:13.304
wonders for
your leathery skin.
Did you lose weight?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.672
Prison food, am I right?

16:14.674 --> 16:16.240
(growls)

16:16.242 --> 16:17.976
No, no, I guess not.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.744
-(growling)
-(whistling blowing)

16:19.746 --> 16:22.313
-Huh?
-Guard: The Stabbington's
have escaped!

16:23.450 --> 16:25.483
Guess we're gonna need
a couple of human shields,

16:25.485 --> 16:27.151
if we wanna get outta here.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.821
Ahh, thank goodness.

16:29.823 --> 16:31.022
Wait a minute.
(grunts)

16:31.024 --> 16:33.157
(disgusted groan)

16:33.159 --> 16:35.259
Eugene:
Let's rethink
the sack thing, huh?

16:35.261 --> 16:37.729
-It's wreaking
havoc on my hair.
-Cassandra: Nice, Eugene.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.465
Huh?

16:40.467 --> 16:42.834
Hold it right there!
Don't move.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.005
Cassandra!

16:47.007 --> 16:49.140
-Dad.
-Hmm, Dad.

16:49.142 --> 16:52.543
I'd call your men off
if you know what's good
for your precious daughter...

16:52.545 --> 16:54.445
Captain.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.047
I hear voices.

16:56.049 --> 16:58.383
Sounds like my plan worked!

16:58.385 --> 16:59.717
Cass! Eugene!

16:59.719 --> 17:01.652
How did this happen?

17:01.654 --> 17:03.187
Stay back, Princess.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.590
Guards, lower your weapons.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.495
It's okay, Blondie,
I'm working on a plan.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.130
Okay, Eugene,
let's hear it.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.799
Uh, I-I-I can't say it now,
cause they can still hear us.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.969
Captain, they're getting away.

17:23.643 --> 17:24.876
Captain:
Come on!

17:36.156 --> 17:37.321
Rapunzel:
We'll never
catch up to them.

17:38.691 --> 17:40.591
Wait, but thanks to Cass,

17:40.593 --> 17:43.494
I know where
the corridor empties.
Come on, Pascal!

17:46.066 --> 17:47.598
Captain:
Over here! They went this way.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.167
Hurry!

17:51.271 --> 17:52.670
Ho, hey!

17:52.672 --> 17:54.105
Probably not the best idea.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.281
Time to get rid
of the extra baggage.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.348
(both grunting)

18:04.350 --> 18:06.117
Say, "Sayonara."

18:07.187 --> 18:08.519
(Patch grunts)

18:08.521 --> 18:11.289
Actually, I just got
a much better idea.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.425
-(yelps)
-Let's snuff out Rider,

18:14.427 --> 18:17.295
but keep the Captain's daughter
as a bargaining chip.

18:17.297 --> 18:20.131
You just sit there
like a good little girl.

18:20.133 --> 18:22.467
This will just
take a second.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.367
-(yelps)
-Hey!

18:23.369 --> 18:24.669
Where do you think
you're going?

18:27.440 --> 18:28.573
Uhh...

18:28.575 --> 18:30.808
We've got a little
score to settle.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.914
Guys, guys, hold on!

18:36.916 --> 18:39.550
You clearly have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.385
Cassandra is useless.

18:42.422 --> 18:44.088
(mutters)
Right there.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.590
I'm the princess' boyfriend.

18:45.592 --> 18:49.494
I come with
a lot more leverage.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.231
Sideburns:
It ain't about leverage
with you, Rider.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.832
It's about revenge.

18:54.834 --> 18:58.269
We've been waiting
a long time for this.
Say goodnight.

18:58.271 --> 18:59.570
(clears throat)

18:59.572 --> 19:00.838
(grunts)

19:00.840 --> 19:02.373
(rumbling)

19:06.412 --> 19:09.280
Now that's how
you use a halberd.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.782
Yep, it's all about
the leverage.

19:11.784 --> 19:13.484
-(rumbling intensifies)
-(gasps)

19:13.486 --> 19:15.319
Eugene! Come on,
let's get outta here.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.091
(grunts)

19:20.093 --> 19:22.360
(both panting)

19:24.697 --> 19:26.297
Rapunzel:
Hello?

19:26.299 --> 19:27.565
Are you guys down there?

19:28.801 --> 19:30.201
Blondie?

19:39.379 --> 19:41.379
(grunting, panting)

19:43.950 --> 19:45.383
(sighs)

19:45.385 --> 19:48.719
Oh! I am so glad
you're both okay.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.021
Guard:
There they are.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.724
(groaning)

19:56.629 --> 19:58.596
Cassandra, you okay?

19:59.966 --> 20:01.299
I am now.

20:03.203 --> 20:04.502
Eugene...

20:04.504 --> 20:06.404
I am so sorry.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.540
I had no idea my game
would lead to such a disaster.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.642
I really thought
you guys would have fun.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.678
Oh, look, you've
had better ideas,

20:13.680 --> 20:15.580
but you don't have
to apologize.

20:15.582 --> 20:18.316
It must be hard with
both of us going at each
other's throats all the time,

20:18.318 --> 20:19.383
so from now on,

20:19.385 --> 20:21.819
even though I have
no idea what you see in her,

20:21.821 --> 20:23.821
I'll try to be nice
to the dragon lady--

20:23.823 --> 20:25.923
I mean, Cassandra.

20:28.828 --> 20:32.096
(inhales, exhales deeply)

20:32.098 --> 20:33.197
You ready?

20:33.199 --> 20:36.400
Uh, yeah, yeah.

20:36.402 --> 20:38.703
Okay, I can do this.
I just gotta walk in there,

20:38.705 --> 20:41.105
and tell the scariest
most intimidating man
in the world

20:41.107 --> 20:43.407
that I broke
his favorite vase.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.575
He's gonna kill me.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.578
My dad's not gonna kill you!

20:47.580 --> 20:48.779
Hey, do you
remember last month

20:48.781 --> 20:51.382
when the royal tailor
accidentally tore his robe?

20:51.384 --> 20:53.050
My dad didn't kill him.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.019
Of course, he's got
like a million of those robes,

20:55.021 --> 20:57.788
and only one of those vases
exists in the entire world,

20:57.790 --> 21:01.626
and come to think of it,
I remember seeing the tailor
locked in the stockade.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.527
Blondie, not helping.

21:03.529 --> 21:04.595
Yeah, sorry.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.031
All right.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.899
I just gotta face...

21:08.901 --> 21:11.435
the music?

21:25.618 --> 21:27.385
Hey, you got a sec?

21:27.387 --> 21:28.986
I guess.

21:28.988 --> 21:31.155
I just wanted to say
that I really appreciate
what you did.

21:31.157 --> 21:33.658
I figured if you got
kicked out of the castle,

21:33.660 --> 21:35.259
Rapunzel would be all mopey,

21:35.261 --> 21:37.762
and... I don't
really do mope.

21:37.764 --> 21:39.563
Ha ha, so...

21:39.565 --> 21:41.465
does this mean I can
borrow your halberd?

21:41.467 --> 21:42.500
(growls)

21:42.502 --> 21:44.602
No halberd, okay,
yeah, I'm okay with that.

21:44.604 --> 21:47.505
-(happy squeak)
-Yes!

21:47.507 --> 21:49.507
Cassandra:
By the way, where is my halberd?

21:49.509 --> 21:51.942
-Eugene: I don't know.
-Cassandra:
Well, you had it last.

21:51.944 --> 21:53.277
Eugene:
I did not.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.912
Cassandra:
Oh, here we go again.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.315
I can't believe you're
gonna lie to my face.

21:57.317 --> 21:59.016
Eugene:
I can't even look
at your face.

Eugene:

<i> ¶ Now I got my eyes</i>
<i> opening wider ¶</i>

22:13.800 --> 22:16.300
<i> ¶ My heart burning like fire ¶</i>

22:16.302 --> 22:18.636
<i> ¶ Feels like I'm so alive ¶</i>

22:18.638 --> 22:20.438
<i> ¶ I'm never going back ¶</i>

22:20.440 --> 22:23.474

<i> ¶ Who I am</i>
<i> I can't contain it ¶</i>

22:25.712 --> 22:29.146
<i> ¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶</i>

22:29.148 --> 22:31.182
<i> ¶ Cause there's more</i>
<i> of me to give ¶</i>

22:32.518 --> 22:34.218
<i> ¶ Oh yeah ¶</i>

22:34.220 --> 22:36.587
<i> ¶ There's more of me to give ¶</i>
