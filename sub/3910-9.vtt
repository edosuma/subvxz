Next is a Bravo scripted
original series.

00:06.474 --> 00:07.975
[phone chimes]

00:10.211 --> 00:11.945
[upbeat music]

00:11.979 --> 00:14.048
"We are pleased to invite
your son, Henry Portman,

00:14.082 --> 00:16.617
to join Collegiate's
Kindergarten class."

00:16.650 --> 00:17.618
Yes!

00:17.651 --> 00:21.189
Yes! Yes!
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:26.960 --> 00:27.995
(Marisa)
What?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.430
BJ didn't get in?

00:29.463 --> 00:31.365
But I had two trustees call

00:31.399 --> 00:34.435
and one of them built
the science lab!

00:34.468 --> 00:35.669
Ugh!

00:35.703 --> 00:37.538
Sh*치! Sh*치! Sh*치!

00:37.571 --> 00:39.173
God damn it!

00:39.207 --> 00:40.174
Aah!

00:40.208 --> 00:42.610
Please be a yes.
Please be a yes.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.412
Come on, come on.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.580
Oh, my God!

00:46.614 --> 00:48.816
* Hey, yes, you know

00:48.849 --> 00:52.086
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

00:56.890 --> 00:59.927
Breathe in through your nose,
and out through your mouth.

00:59.960 --> 01:02.130
Hey, we've got two more
rejections from Trinity,

01:02.130 --> 01:03.364
three from Morace Mann.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.532
One hypertensive,
one panic attack,

01:04.565 --> 01:06.200
and an antidepressant/diet pill
interaction.

01:06.234 --> 01:09.470
[phone ringing]
Okay.

01:09.503 --> 01:12.806
You know there's this thing
called public school, right?

01:12.840 --> 01:14.608
[sighs]

01:14.642 --> 01:18.412
(Hazel, Dottie, Miles)
You've reached Aunt Vanessa.
Leave a message!

01:18.446 --> 01:20.548
[beep]
Dottie just got into Caldecott!

01:20.581 --> 01:22.783
That's like kiddie-Harvard.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.653
Yay!
Yes!

01:25.686 --> 01:27.321
Oh, my God!

01:27.355 --> 01:29.590
Oh, yes, yes.

01:29.623 --> 01:30.858
Call me back.

01:30.891 --> 01:34.562
*

01:35.896 --> 01:41.001
Dottie got into Caldecott
and Miles got into Olmstead?

01:41.034 --> 01:42.536
That is amazing.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.637
Yeah.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.038
Our girls will be
at the same school,

01:45.072 --> 01:46.607
and so will our boys.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.876
Right.
I almost forgot.

01:48.909 --> 01:53.614
Anyway, I am so glad that you
could be my pick up person.

01:53.647 --> 01:57.218
And remember,
nobody knows about the surgery.

01:57.251 --> 01:59.587
Got it.
My lips are sealed.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.422
How's your cooter?

02:01.455 --> 02:05.793
My doctor says, I am
anatomically a virgin again.

02:05.826 --> 02:08.028
Lex and I really needed this,

02:08.061 --> 02:09.029
if you know what I mean.

02:09.062 --> 02:11.599
I don't, but whatever works.

02:11.632 --> 02:13.834
So, what was going on with
Rutherford when I called?

02:13.867 --> 02:16.036
Oh, you are not
gonna believe this.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.772
I know Santa isn't real.

02:18.806 --> 02:23.444
The thing I'm most
disappointed in is the lying.

02:23.477 --> 02:24.445
What?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.514
Did Shipley or
MacCallister tell him?

02:26.547 --> 02:28.582
No, they still believe.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.452
And now Rutherford is demanding
a second birthday every year

02:31.485 --> 02:32.686
to keep his mouth shut.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.888
He will go far in this world.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.224
Just what I need.

02:36.224 --> 02:38.859
Three weeks out from NACHO.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.428
You mean two weeks.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.095
No.
Three.

02:42.129 --> 02:43.431
Didn't I tell you?

02:43.464 --> 02:47.235
I pushed the date so de Blasio
and Chirlane could come.

02:47.235 --> 02:51.305
And so I could re-lose
my virginity on prom night.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.407
My doctor said
I'll be healed by then.

02:53.441 --> 02:55.008
- [scoffs]
- What?

02:55.042 --> 02:57.611
That's the same night as
Vanessa's 40th birthday.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.746
Bummer.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.948
I am so screwed.

03:00.981 --> 03:03.851
Oh.
Jill.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.954
Of course you want to be
at your best friend's party.

03:06.987 --> 03:08.756
But Vanessa's a doctor.

03:08.789 --> 03:12.260
And if anyone understands how
many obese little lives

03:12.260 --> 03:14.862
are hanging in
the balance, it's her.

03:14.895 --> 03:15.863
[phone chimes]

03:15.896 --> 03:16.930
[upbeat music]

03:16.964 --> 03:18.065
Are you late for something?

03:18.098 --> 03:19.733
No, I'm fine.

03:19.767 --> 03:23.637
*

03:23.671 --> 03:27.541
Aww, Jill, I'm so grateful
to you for picking me up.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.277
Every woman
should have a confidant

03:29.277 --> 03:31.144
she doesn't have to impress.

03:31.178 --> 03:34.315
That seems to be
my specialty.

03:34.348 --> 03:36.116
Where's that Moshe?

03:36.149 --> 03:38.986
Why couldn't he pick up
cigarettes during my procedure?

03:39.019 --> 03:42.956
So, Candace,
new hair, new pair,

03:42.990 --> 03:46.494
is there something or someone
you want to tell me about?

03:46.527 --> 03:49.997
Well, aren't you
the little sleuth.

03:50.030 --> 03:53.100
In fact, I have taken a lover.

03:53.133 --> 03:54.167
What?

03:54.201 --> 03:58.005
- Who is he?
- All in due time.

03:58.038 --> 04:00.841
Oh, I have a surprise.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.377
Go on, open it.

04:03.411 --> 04:06.580
I want you to take my place at
the hat luncheon this Friday.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.749
My breasts will
still be resting up.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.051
Oh, wow,
I have to check my calendar.

04:11.084 --> 04:15.789
Jill, this luncheon raises over
$12 million for charity.

04:15.823 --> 04:18.859
This is the most important
philanthropic event

04:18.892 --> 04:20.394
for the entire social season.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.530
You don't check your calendar.

04:22.563 --> 04:25.866
You accept the honor
and you go.

04:25.899 --> 04:28.969
Is it crazy that
I kind of wanna go?

04:29.002 --> 04:30.938
After all these years
mocking it,

04:30.971 --> 04:34.775
I'm secretly dying to see what
goes on at the hat lunch.

04:34.808 --> 04:38.245
So go. There are worse things
than a $3,000 a plate lunch

04:38.346 --> 04:40.481
in Central Park that
someone else is paying for.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.916
Right?
It's only lunch.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.117
There better be bread.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.587
[phone chimes]

04:46.620 --> 04:48.155
I guess I'm going.

04:48.188 --> 04:51.158
[rock music]

04:51.191 --> 04:56.730
*

04:56.764 --> 04:57.865
What's in the bag?

04:57.898 --> 05:00.200
Oh, nothing.
School project.

05:00.368 --> 05:03.070
So, your fiesta.

05:03.103 --> 05:05.573
What do you think about doing
something late-ish, like 9:00?

05:05.606 --> 05:08.376
Ugh, I'm turning 40, not 25.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.011
You parent people think it's
your kids making you tired,

05:11.044 --> 05:12.446
but it's just old age.

05:12.480 --> 05:16.183
I get exhausted walking home
from the liquor store.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.586
Okay, don't hate me,

05:18.619 --> 05:22.022
but the NACHO gala is now
the same night as your party,

05:22.055 --> 05:23.957
and I'm vice chair.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.060
I know, "vice chair."
What does that even mean?

05:27.094 --> 05:28.929
It's okay, I'll just
do the rule of three.

05:28.962 --> 05:30.297
What's that again?

05:30.398 --> 05:32.400
It's that trick I do when
I wanna ditch a party early.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.234
I just put myself
in front of the hostess

05:34.267 --> 05:35.969
three separate times.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.806
Whoo-hoo!
Party rockin'!

05:38.839 --> 05:40.574
So sh*치faced.

05:40.608 --> 05:43.043
And then,
no matter how early I bail,

05:43.076 --> 05:44.878
she'd swear I closed
the place down.

05:44.912 --> 05:46.046
Works every time.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.048
Okay, you have to patent that.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.116
I have.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.018
Anyway, I'll just be
a little late

05:51.051 --> 05:53.286
and a lot overdressed to
Tortilla Flats.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.655
But I will be there.

05:54.688 --> 05:59.292
Or, crazy idea, skip NACHO
since it's just a tax-free way

05:59.326 --> 06:02.162
of bullying husky kids
into eating disorders.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.164
- Right?
- You know what?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.433
I'll make it work.

06:05.433 --> 06:06.900
We've wasted too much time
on it, anyway.

06:06.934 --> 06:09.102
Oh, hey, on Friday
my shift ends at noon.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.705
Wanna try that
weird empanada place on Third,

06:11.739 --> 06:13.173
then do bad movie Friday?

06:13.206 --> 06:15.175
Um, shoot, I can't,

06:15.208 --> 06:17.578
I have this
annoying kid errand.

06:17.611 --> 06:19.079
[sighs]
That was gonna be my excuse

06:19.112 --> 06:20.448
to not go running.

06:20.481 --> 06:21.949
I could run your errands
with you.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.652
Oh, no,
I wouldn't subject you.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.653
Snooze fest.

06:25.686 --> 06:26.654
[laughs softly]

06:26.687 --> 06:29.657
[upbeat music]

06:29.690 --> 06:33.160
*

06:33.193 --> 06:34.962
(Jill)
These eyelashes.

06:34.995 --> 06:38.098
I feel like a silent movie star
with a touch of slut.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.500
[laughs]

06:39.533 --> 06:43.937
And for my nails, can I get
one coat of hot tub harlot

06:43.971 --> 06:47.107
and one coat
of Vienna Bordello?

06:47.140 --> 06:50.210
And Jill, you might
wanna lose the black.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.179
This is the hat luncheon
after all.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.983
All right, I'll try...
Tinker Bell's labia.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.651
When in Rome.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.887
So, Brooke,
about the NACHO prom.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.822
Ugh, I'm so glad
you reminded me.

07:01.855 --> 07:04.658
I've put you in charge
of the three Cs.

07:04.692 --> 07:07.027
Candid photography,
the crowning ceremony--

07:07.060 --> 07:08.395
(Jill)
Wait, rewind.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.964
I thought you booked a major
photographer to cover the event.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.332
Of course, Patrick McMullen.

07:12.365 --> 07:16.570
But your eye will catch quirky
moments that no one else could.

07:16.604 --> 07:18.972
The third C is
for comic relief,

07:19.006 --> 07:21.108
which is what I expect
from your speech

07:21.141 --> 07:23.544
when you crown
the king and queen of prom,

07:23.577 --> 07:24.845
closing the night.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.279
[sighs]

07:26.313 --> 07:28.015
(Brooke)
Simone, what the hell?

07:28.048 --> 07:29.349
(Simone)
Sorry I'm late.

07:29.382 --> 07:32.285
I had the worst morning
with little Sebastian.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.254
I know the tooth fairy
isn't real.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.056
The jig is up, Mom.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.392
Oh, my God. The same thing just
happened to me with Rutherford.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.562
- Did he say who told him?
- Yes.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.563
It was Beatrix.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.897
[gasps]

07:43.931 --> 07:47.535
Well, someone else must be
filling Beatrix's head

07:47.535 --> 07:49.637
because she's refusing
to take a bath.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.104
According to my nanny.

07:51.138 --> 07:55.308
I'll get in that bath once
the global water crisis ends.

07:55.342 --> 07:58.946
That's weird, Miles is suddenly
worried about hate crimes.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.148
Anti-Semitism is on the rise.

08:01.181 --> 08:03.350
It's like the 1930s
all over again.

08:03.383 --> 08:05.352
Do I need
a female circumcision?

08:05.385 --> 08:07.821
Why is the middle class
disappearing?

08:07.855 --> 08:09.557
Are we the middle class?

08:09.590 --> 08:13.126
Someone is stealing
our children's innocence

08:13.160 --> 08:15.829
and replacing it
with the truth.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.699
Or, some kid just walked by that
paranoid dude with a bullhorn

08:18.732 --> 08:22.369
outside Fairway.

08:22.402 --> 08:25.639
I just sent an email blast
to the entire school.

08:25.673 --> 08:29.577
We are gonna smoke this bad seed
right out of the soil.

08:29.610 --> 08:30.578
(woman)
Ladies...

08:30.611 --> 08:31.579
[classical music]

08:31.612 --> 08:33.581
* Hallelujah-lelujah

08:33.581 --> 08:35.115
- [gasps]
- Oh!

08:35.148 --> 08:37.384
* Hallelujah-lelujah

08:37.417 --> 08:40.187
[gasps]
They're breathtaking.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.455
So, Brooke,
back to the NACHO prom.

08:42.489 --> 08:44.692
What if we did the crowning
ceremony at the beginning

08:44.725 --> 08:45.693
of the night?

08:45.726 --> 08:46.894
Like, right away.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.161
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.831
Everybody knows
the king and queen get crowned

08:50.864 --> 08:53.266
at the end of the night.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.368
I am so excited.

08:55.402 --> 08:58.171
[laughter]

08:58.205 --> 08:59.206
[sighs]

09:04.612 --> 09:07.280
*

09:07.314 --> 09:08.315
Lex?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.417
Oh, hey, bro.

09:10.450 --> 09:11.685
I'm sorry,
were you napping?

09:11.719 --> 09:14.454
Uh, no, no, I just,
um, mediating.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.024
I'm meditating.
Meditatting-meditating.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.358
So, listen real quick.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.994
I was going over the plans for
the Kyrgyzstan expansion

09:21.028 --> 09:22.930
and we can't use the name
Fortune Bagel over there

09:22.963 --> 09:24.331
Oh...

09:24.364 --> 09:25.766
'Cause it turns out in the
primary Kyrgyz dialect,

09:25.799 --> 09:28.535
bagel means parasite.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.103
Nice, yeah.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.672
Well, now I'm just a little
worried that we'll create

09:31.705 --> 09:33.641
some brand confusion.
We don't want people thinking

09:33.674 --> 09:36.209
we're selling
lucky tapeworms or something.

09:36.243 --> 09:38.445
Yeah, oh, God.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.280
Well, we just need to
come up with a new name.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.649
You know what, uh,...

09:41.649 --> 09:44.417
why don't you just pick out
the name yourself, my man?

09:44.451 --> 09:46.253
I trust you.
[chuckles]

09:46.286 --> 09:47.354
Thanks.

09:47.387 --> 09:48.889
I'm gonna start
thinking of names.

09:48.922 --> 09:51.358
- Yeah.
- I'll run some by clearances.

09:51.391 --> 09:54.327
Talk soon.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.930
I'm Hercules.

[applause]

09:58.666 --> 10:00.668
(chairwoman)
Good afternoon, ladies.

10:00.701 --> 10:05.639
It's hard to believe that some
dogs will never taste elk jerky

10:05.673 --> 10:08.141
or sleep on a featherbed.

10:08.175 --> 10:12.145
At night, on the streets,
these canines will shiver

10:12.179 --> 10:14.447
without the comfort
of a sweater.

10:14.481 --> 10:18.485
But Dog Day Afternoon
is here to say no more.

10:18.518 --> 10:21.054
[applause]

10:21.088 --> 10:23.991
My phone is blowing up.

10:24.024 --> 10:27.160
Ebola, riots,
Elf on the Shelf.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.229
The truth is spreading
like a virus.

10:29.262 --> 10:33.233
And our biggest doggone donor
award goes to...

10:33.266 --> 10:35.568
Candace Von Weber.

10:35.602 --> 10:38.371
[applause]

10:38.405 --> 10:39.873
Help. What do I do?

10:39.907 --> 10:40.941
I'm sitting in her place.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.977
Just smile, and accept it
on her behalf.

10:49.983 --> 10:50.951
Thank you.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.253
Hi, I'm Jill Weber.

10:53.286 --> 10:56.589
Um, if, um, my mother-in-law
Candace were here today,

10:56.623 --> 11:00.828
she would say, Jill,
you do look terrible in pink.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.095
[laughs]

11:02.129 --> 11:03.563
[coughing]

11:03.596 --> 11:08.068
Um, but Candance has never met
an award she didn't like.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.872
And she's been so generous
and loves dogs so much

11:11.905 --> 11:15.242
that she actually morphs into
a Jewish mother around them.

11:15.275 --> 11:17.144
Eat, eat, you're too thin.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.779
[laughter]

11:18.812 --> 11:21.114
She's not even like that
with her grandchildren, people.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.350
[laughter]

11:23.383 --> 11:27.354
But seriously, we owe all our
gratitude to this organization.

11:27.387 --> 11:30.891
for caring for the most
vulnerable New Yorkers,

11:30.924 --> 11:34.995
not counting the homeless
or children or the elderly.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.564
But hats off to you,
dog owners,

11:37.597 --> 11:39.767
because I can barely
take care of my kids.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.602
[laughter]

11:42.635 --> 11:46.206
Okay, in closing,
I just would like to add...

11:46.239 --> 11:48.208
[barks]

11:48.241 --> 11:50.110
That's dog for
thank you very much.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.544
I love you New York City.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.614
Tip your servers, try the
alcohol, I'll be here all week.

11:54.647 --> 11:55.615
Okay.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.951
[applause]

11:57.985 --> 12:01.688
(chairwoman)
Thank you for that very
unexpected comic relief,

12:01.789 --> 12:02.856
Jill Weber.

12:02.890 --> 12:05.192
Where have you been
hiding yourself?

12:05.225 --> 12:07.527
Enjoy your lunch, ladies.

12:07.560 --> 12:09.662
Oh, my God,
I'm sweating buckets.

12:09.696 --> 12:11.832
My pits are dripping.

12:11.865 --> 12:13.500
[laughs]

12:13.533 --> 12:15.368
Yeah.
That was cute.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.405
Uh, we might want to work
on tone before NACHO.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.809
That's a much more
serious cause.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.176
Back to the crisis, ladies.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.879
I have been getting lots
of supportive emails

12:25.913 --> 12:28.681
but no real leads
on a culprit.

12:28.715 --> 12:32.986
Think. Who is the most smugly
informed parent that we know?

12:34.822 --> 12:35.823
Well, don't look at me.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.059
We're a no news family.
No TV, no paper.

12:39.092 --> 12:41.361
No Access Hollywood,
nothing.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.831
We cut out all the photos on
the front pages of the Times

12:43.864 --> 12:45.265
before the kids wake up.

12:45.298 --> 12:47.835
Whenever we run into Jon Stewart
in Turks and Caicos

12:47.835 --> 12:49.837
we talk about everything
but the news.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.339
Okay, I understand the world
is a dangerous place,

12:52.372 --> 12:58.178
but isn't it our job as parents
to prepare the kids for it?

12:58.211 --> 12:59.412
Hey, it wasn't me.

12:59.446 --> 13:02.850
I can barely handle
the news today.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.284
Then we agree.

13:04.317 --> 13:08.555
We have to hunt down this truth
fairy and put a stop to this.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.058
By any means necessary.

Wow.

Hi.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.226
I'm...sweaty.

13:46.259 --> 13:49.129
So, was this the errand that you
didn't want to bore me with?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.899
I am so sorry.
I was embarrassed.

13:51.932 --> 13:54.634
Candace insisted and...

13:54.667 --> 13:56.169
I just need
some normalcy.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.538
Can you please
come over tonight?

13:58.571 --> 14:00.673
I-I guess I can stop by.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.775
Oh.
Hi, Vanessa.

14:02.809 --> 14:05.078
You look...runny.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.713
Just working up a stink.

14:06.746 --> 14:07.948
How's the new baby?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.482
She's wonderful,

14:09.516 --> 14:12.785
especially now that she has
the world's best godmommy.

Wow, you two are like
a pair of mad hatters.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.526
Jill, Bill Cunningham
is taking the group photo

14:19.559 --> 14:20.660
over by the fountain.

14:20.693 --> 14:24.231
We better head out.
So good to see you.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.133
I'll catch up
with you guys in a sec.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.368
We really need to go.

14:28.401 --> 14:31.104
- Sorry.
- Go. Really.

14:31.138 --> 14:34.007
You belong in that photo.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.776
I gotta keep
my heart rate up anyway.

Well, you're coming
over later, right?

Lex, just wanted to run some
ideas by you

14:52.859 --> 14:54.127
if you haven't left yet.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.396
I think I've landed on
some good ones.

No, no, no, no.
It's late.

You go home.
I can do it.

- I'll see you tomorrow.

I'm over it.
Mostly.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.628
Hey, I had a radical idea
for your party.

15:28.661 --> 15:31.731
How about a lunch?

15:31.764 --> 15:32.799
I hope you're kidding.

15:32.832 --> 15:35.002
What happened to
the rule of three?

15:35.002 --> 15:38.005
Apparently being vice chair
isn't just a title.

15:38.005 --> 15:39.306
There are actual jobs.

So just go to NACHO.

You can come to my 50th.

No.

Santa and the tooth fairy

and now the whole preschool

16:20.947 --> 16:24.051
is freaking out about
"the truth fairy."

16:24.084 --> 16:26.753
They've just hired a grief
counselor to help the children

16:26.786 --> 16:28.155
through this traumatic time.

Oh!
You don't remember?

16:33.093 --> 16:34.061
What?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.562
I swear I told you.

The night I babysat.

that great deep talk.

Look, your kids had a lot
of really smart questions

16:59.586 --> 17:01.754
about life
and I answered them.

these people are.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.530

about them or you?

supposed to mean?

far up your sister-in-law's ass,

what's happening to you.

17:18.605 --> 17:20.240
You're turning
into one of them.

at one of those hat luncheons,

17:56.776 --> 17:58.478
I should kidnap
and deprogram you.

for, like, a minute

I'll give you that.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.561
But marriage is work.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.430
See, that's
just the thing.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.798
When I go home,
Brooke is the boss.

19:25.832 --> 19:27.234
It's like I'm walking
on eggshells.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.870
And then I come here,
and there's this laid-back girl

19:30.903 --> 19:33.005
and she lets me
touch her boobies.

19:33.039 --> 19:34.641
'Cause she works for you!

19:34.674 --> 19:36.343
You didn't exactly
invent the concept

19:36.376 --> 19:38.945
of screwing your secretary.

19:38.978 --> 19:41.548
Look...

19:41.581 --> 19:43.816
I regret it.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.485
And I was weak.

19:45.518 --> 19:48.455
And I will never let it
happen again.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.490
Okay?

19:54.327 --> 19:57.297
[rock music]

19:57.330 --> 19:58.365
*

19:58.398 --> 20:01.067
Mommy. Mommy.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.101
Mommy.

20:02.134 --> 20:03.470
Mommy.

20:03.503 --> 20:04.604
Mommy.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.205
Jill.

20:06.239 --> 20:08.040
Miles, what's going on?

20:08.074 --> 20:11.244
I was sliding down a rainbow,
then Dora the Explorer

20:11.278 --> 20:14.847
set it on fire and kept saying,
"Can you say climate change?"

20:14.881 --> 20:16.349
Over and over.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.285
Okay, sweetheart.
You just had a bad dream.

20:18.318 --> 20:23.290
Come here.

20:23.323 --> 20:26.259
If there's no magic
or fairies and just bad stuff

20:26.293 --> 20:29.061
like diseases and war,
what's left?

20:29.095 --> 20:31.864
Well, honey, I think there's
something even better

20:31.898 --> 20:34.534
than fairies,
and that's family.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.069
Is Aunt Vanessa
part of our family?

20:37.103 --> 20:41.140
Well, no, but we call her Aunt
Vanessa because we love her.

20:41.173 --> 20:42.141
A lot.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.277
Then why were you guys
fighting tonight?

20:44.311 --> 20:48.348
Or were those just grown up play
noises like you do with Daddy?

20:48.381 --> 20:49.349
You can hear that?

20:49.382 --> 20:51.083
Where is Daddy?

20:51.117 --> 20:52.352
He'll be home soon, angel.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.387
But we have to go
to sleep, okay?

20:54.421 --> 20:58.124
Good night.
I'm rolling over.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.396
Let's face it.

21:03.430 --> 21:06.633
It's time to get rid of
the electoral college.

21:06.666 --> 21:08.167
Are boogers a carb?

21:08.200 --> 21:10.970
When will my boob jobs grow in?

21:11.003 --> 21:15.007
It all comes down to
campaign finance reform.

21:15.041 --> 21:18.010
Until then,
we're stuck with the status quo.

21:18.044 --> 21:21.948
Given the state of the world
today, I'd argue yes.

21:21.981 --> 21:24.417
We still need feminism.

21:24.451 --> 21:27.119
