that is not what I mean,

00:17.131 --> 00:19.100
and I am offended
that you would try

00:19.135 --> 00:20.770
and taint this treasure
hunt with learning.

00:20.805 --> 00:23.241
-You guys.
-Careful.

00:23.276 --> 00:24.778
Good thing you didn't
get any on the treasure.

00:56.545 --> 00:58.514
Ooh. Not unlike this
bold and daring chapeau.

00:58.549 --> 01:01.988
And the story behind it is
equally bold and daring.

Now there's a man
who knows a good hat.

It's not just a head
covering, it's a statement,
am I right?

01:21.829 --> 01:24.333
I'm not putting shiny new
treasure in a dirty old bin.
