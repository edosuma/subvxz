[reporter 1] <i>TWA Flight 847,</i>
<i>hijacked five days ago by Shia Muslims,</i>

00:09.968 --> 00:12.053
<i>sits on the tarmac at Beirut Airport.</i>

00:12.137 --> 00:15.390
<i>Today, an exclusive interview</i>
<i>with pilot Captain John Testrake.</i>

00:15.890 --> 00:18.059
-[reporter 2] <i>Have you been well-treated?</i>
-[Testrake] <i>Yes.</i>

00:18.143 --> 00:19.352
-Right.
-[reporter 2] <i>Are you able to eat</i>

00:19.436 --> 00:20.729
<i>what you want to eat?</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:25.608
<i>Well, uh... </i>[chuckles]
<i>They sometimes bring us airline food</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:28.236
<i>and they sometimes bring us, uh,</i>
<i>Lebanese food,</i>

00:28.319 --> 00:30.989
<i>-and it's different, but it's delicious.</i>
-What's Lebanese food?

00:31.072 --> 00:33.658
-Like, beans or something.
<i>-The food is okay.</i>

00:33.742 --> 00:36.369
Or, like, noodles with spices, I think.

00:36.453 --> 00:39.247
The bathroom on that plane
has to be disgusting by now.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.332
There's no one else onboard.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.836
They took everyone off and hid them
in... What's it called?

00:44.919 --> 00:46.588
-Hezbollah.
-They're in Beirut.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.715
-The city's called Beirut.
-[Stacey] It's Hezbollah.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.925
Hezbollah's a group of people.
This is a city,

00:51.009 --> 00:52.218
and the city is Beirut.

00:52.302 --> 00:54.179
Can we all just stop saying that word?

00:54.262 --> 00:55.764
[reporter 2] <i>Any messages</i>
<i>for your families?</i>

01:02.604 --> 01:03.688
[Debbie] Sorry.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.943
Hi, I'm sorry I'm late.
I had my own hostage situation here.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.781
Those hijackers have nothing
on this little terrorist.

01:12.864 --> 01:15.033
I will be back at five.
Don't make me wait, Mark.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.536
-Are you taking off?
-I have practice in an hour.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.664
It's in an hour.
I could have three meals in an hour.

01:23.833 --> 01:27.087
Um, well... I am not staying for you.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.840
The hotel has no food,
and I need to carbo-load.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.510
-I'm just gonna use my hands.
-She's gonna go for it. Oh--

01:34.511 --> 01:35.678
Look what Mommy's doing.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.514
-That's scary. Mommy's scary.
-Oh, my God.

01:37.597 --> 01:41.309
-Yeah, of course, you're perfect now.
-[gasps] Look at her go.

01:41.392 --> 01:42.227
[clears throat]

01:42.310 --> 01:46.564
[Reagan] <i>The 39 Americans held hostage</i>
<i>for 17 days by terrorists in Lebanon</i>

01:47.148 --> 01:50.360
<i>are free, safe, and at this moment,</i>
<i>on their way to Frankfurt...</i>

01:50.443 --> 01:53.488
Too bad that whole thing is over.
It was a ratings bonanza.

01:53.571 --> 01:54.572
Mm.

01:54.656 --> 01:55.573
[chuckles]

01:56.783 --> 01:57.992
Is that the lineup?

01:59.244 --> 02:01.538
Yes. Yes, it is.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.957
Look, here's <i>GLOW.</i>

02:04.707 --> 02:06.501
Right between <i>Dr. Gene Scott</i>

02:06.584 --> 02:10.296
and a new animated show
called <i>Miyamoto Musashi.</i>

02:10.380 --> 02:14.384
Ah. Between a nutjob televangelist
and an oriental cartoon.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.720
[laughs] You'd be surprised.
It's a great slot.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.347
Right.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.058
Well, we, uh... We just have a few notes.

02:22.142 --> 02:25.895
Overall, extremely positive.
Just a few concerns.

02:25.979 --> 02:30.400
Specifically, the, uh...
The colorful language and the KKK.

02:30.483 --> 02:32.902
Oh, really?
You didn't like that one, Glen?

02:34.362 --> 02:36.406
Well, uh... Ah! [laughs]

02:36.489 --> 02:38.324
-Yeah.
-I'll tell you what I did love:

02:38.408 --> 02:40.368
the two black girls. We want more of them.

02:40.451 --> 02:41.494
Oh, sure you do.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.080
Socially beneficial programming,
part of our mission.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.083
Hey, sorry I'm late. [sniffs]

02:49.502 --> 02:50.420
Please continue.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.674
-We were just talking about the KKK.
-[chuckles] Yes, of course.

02:54.757 --> 02:57.427
Have you guys, uh, determined
a filming location yet?

02:59.679 --> 03:01.890
-You don't know where you're filming?
-[Sam] No, no. No.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.391
We have a great venue picked out.

03:03.474 --> 03:07.312
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.
But maybe KDTV has an extra studio

03:07.395 --> 03:09.063
-as an alternative.
-[Glen] Mr. Howard,

03:09.147 --> 03:11.274
we were very explicit about this.

03:11.357 --> 03:15.194
We provide the cameras and the airwaves,
you provide everything else.

03:15.778 --> 03:18.615
That's part of the reason
we agreed to do this project.

03:19.198 --> 03:22.619
[chuckles] Right. Sorry.
First-time producer jitters and all that.

03:22.702 --> 03:23.953
[Glen chuckles] Yeah.

03:26.706 --> 03:27.874
[Glen clears throat]

03:27.957 --> 03:31.336
Well, I'm very excited, guys. All right?
We'll talk soon.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.462
-Sam.
-Oh, yeah.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.547
Okay. All right, Bash.

03:34.631 --> 03:36.132
-Okay.
-Talk to you later.

03:37.467 --> 03:39.969
-That went well.
-What the fuck are you talking about?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.055
Where the hell have you been
for two weeks?

03:42.138 --> 03:44.182
Well, I started
at the Redondo Fun Factory.

03:44.265 --> 03:47.560
I got the high score on <i>Burger Time,</i>
then I was in a little beach shack

03:47.644 --> 03:49.437
and I met this guy Raúl
who makes tequila--

03:49.520 --> 03:53.608
I don't need your travel itinerary,
I need $9,000 so I don't lose the venue.

03:54.609 --> 03:55.693
[whispers] There's no money.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.405
[in normal voice] Birdie cut me off, okay?
I've got nothing.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.075
I had a few thousand
which I tried to turn at the racetrack,

04:02.158 --> 04:04.202
but then "Pyrrhic Victory"
came in fucking seventh.

04:04.285 --> 04:06.829
Well, what about <i>GLOW?</i>
What about my movie?

04:06.913 --> 04:08.248
We had an agreement, man.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.960
[stammers] I know. And I'm sorry, Sam.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.380
You're the fuckin' producer.
You're a human checkbook.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.966
And if you're not that,
you're just some overeager fanboy

04:18.049 --> 04:21.219
who's sold 14 women
on some crazy fuckin' pipe dream.

04:21.302 --> 04:24.389
[stammers] I'm gonna get it together.
It's not over yet.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.975
When there's no more money, it's over.

04:30.687 --> 04:31.729
[sighs]

04:33.356 --> 04:34.399
So, we're canceled.

04:34.899 --> 04:36.276
Well, technically,

04:36.359 --> 04:38.444
you can't really be canceled
if you haven't aired.

04:39.237 --> 04:40.488
But we're on hiatus.

04:40.571 --> 04:41.614
Open-ended.

04:42.198 --> 04:46.494
-Should we start looking for other jobs?
-Well, do what you gotta do, but...

04:47.078 --> 04:48.663
yeah, probably.

04:50.373 --> 04:53.042
Okay, this is bullshit, Sam.
We've all worked really hard.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.963
I don't even talk to my dad anymore.
That's how bad I wanna do this.

04:57.547 --> 05:00.425
Do you guys know how many plays I've done
with no budget,

05:00.508 --> 05:04.554
where we've had to build every prop,
every piece of scenery?

05:05.179 --> 05:08.057
I did a version of<i> Peter Pan</i>
where we couldn't afford a flying rig,

05:08.141 --> 05:11.269
so two stage hands carried me around
for three hours.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.812
-How much do we need?
-Yeah.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.523
$9,000.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.191
-[Melrose] What the fuck?
-[Stacey] Shit.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.319
No, please.
No, we can make that in our sleep.

05:19.402 --> 05:23.906
-Charge people to watch us sleep?
-No. We fundraise.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.658
-Shake the trees.
-We should do a car wash.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.244
Yes! It's LA. Everybody has a car.

05:28.328 --> 05:32.206
We can wear bikini tops and pretend
to fawn over engine size and horsepower.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.374
-Eh.
-No, trust me.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.752
In college,
my sorority raised thousands of dollars

05:35.835 --> 05:38.588
for world hunger.
We used that money to remodel the deck.

05:45.136 --> 05:49.599
So, all I had to do to get you over
to the house was freeze your trust.

05:49.807 --> 05:50.641
[sighs] Heh.

05:50.725 --> 05:53.561
I'll remember that.
Oh, hand me my readers.

05:56.773 --> 05:59.442
What's with the seating chart?
Lily getting remarried?

06:00.401 --> 06:05.198
Very funny. No, your sister
left the Persian months ago.

06:05.281 --> 06:09.243
I'm having a fund-raiser
for Nancy's Just Say No campaign.

06:09.327 --> 06:10.411
I sent you the details.

06:10.995 --> 06:13.581
-Mm-hmm.
-This calligraphy is terrible.

06:14.373 --> 06:17.668
-So modern.
-Yeah, well, it's a lot to produce.

06:18.628 --> 06:23.424
You have a lot of people counting on you
to spell their names correctly...

06:23.508 --> 06:25.885
[stammers] and seat them and feed them.

06:26.969 --> 06:27.970
What do you want?

06:28.554 --> 06:29.722
I'm requesting a thaw.

06:29.806 --> 06:31.224
-No.
-[sighs]

06:31.307 --> 06:34.936
You have spent hundreds of thousands
of dollars in less than three months.

06:35.019 --> 06:36.312
Unless you're running for office,

06:36.396 --> 06:39.315
I can't possibly imagine
where all the money has gone.

06:43.194 --> 06:47.532
I'm producing a women's wrestling show
for KDTV.

06:48.157 --> 06:49.033
Yes, it's real.

06:49.534 --> 06:52.537
It's the first time I've put your money
into something I care about.

06:52.620 --> 06:55.331
And I just need 9,000 more dollars

06:55.414 --> 06:59.085
so I can finish what I started.
Come on, Birdie! Just say yes.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.754
-That's off-message.
-Think of it like an investment.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.132
[stammers] An opportunity to get in
on the ground floor

07:04.215 --> 07:06.134
of a really exciting new venture.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.137
I don't have any specs,
but I can get you a business plan.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.390
Know what, why don't you come down
to the gym and see it for yourself?

07:12.473 --> 07:16.269
Come on down to that worthless property
that you can't even get insured,

07:16.352 --> 07:18.354
because, hey, it's on a fault line.

07:18.855 --> 07:20.356
Another wise decision.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.192
Consider it a loan.
Cut me a check and I'll pay you back.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.778
Since when do we talk
so openly about money?

07:25.862 --> 07:26.863
What, are we Jews?

07:26.946 --> 07:29.824
Mom, I got a lot of people counting on me.
This is important.

07:29.907 --> 07:35.204
And keeping poor black children
off of crack is very important to me.

07:36.789 --> 07:39.876
I expect you at that party on time.

07:39.959 --> 07:43.254
I also need you to introduce me,
since Bill Buckley canceled.

07:43.337 --> 07:45.840
He claims he's on a deadline,
but he's probably just...

07:46.090 --> 07:47.508
wandering around his house,

07:47.592 --> 07:49.260
fiddling with his harpsichord.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.889
[pop music playing]

07:56.058 --> 07:58.394
[Debbie] Hi! Welcome to the car wash!

07:58.478 --> 08:02.523
How are you? So it's $10 for a hand-wash,
$20 for interior work.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.900
-[man] I'll do $20.
-Okay.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.818
[Jenny giggling]

08:05.902 --> 08:06.819
Hi.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.197
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

08:11.616 --> 08:13.493
Oh, are these nail clippings?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.286
[Ruth] Maybe they're Fritos.

08:16.496 --> 08:18.247
[vacuum powers on]

08:19.207 --> 08:20.833
[chattering]

08:31.844 --> 08:32.678
Yeah?

08:33.846 --> 08:35.806
Do you really think
the show might go away?

08:35.890 --> 08:38.559
Like, we'd all never see each other again?

08:38.643 --> 08:41.938
It's not sleep-away camp,
I mean, it's-- It's a job.

08:42.021 --> 08:44.774
All jobs are a crapshoot. Get used to it.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.653
What?
Did you steal more of my shit?

08:58.120 --> 09:01.624
-I did not invite you.
-I wanted to support women's sports.

09:01.707 --> 09:05.211
They gave me a new parking spot at work.
My car's filthy. It's under a fig tree.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.464
Well, you'll have to pay double.
For the fig juice.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.591
Okay.

09:14.136 --> 09:16.806
Um, I'll be right back.
I'm just gonna go get a soda.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.233
So, that's the guy?
In the Beemer right there?

09:31.904 --> 09:32.822
Yep.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.324
Not what I expected.

09:36.284 --> 09:38.786
You were expecting what? Sean Penn?

09:38.869 --> 09:41.914
No, just someone less
like a giant Cabbage Patch Kid.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.125
I mean, I'm better-looking
than that idiot.

09:44.750 --> 09:48.921
I'm a sucker for non-threatening,
unavailable men who compliment me.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.467
[door opens]

09:53.551 --> 09:55.428
Ugh. I got soap in my eyes.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.890
-Why aren't you out there helping?
-Uh...

09:59.974 --> 10:01.559
I don't look good in a bikini.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.936
[grunting] Yet.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.355
[telephone ringing]

10:07.189 --> 10:08.190
[sighs]

10:10.318 --> 10:11.152
Hello.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.738
Oh. Uh...

10:14.363 --> 10:16.032
Baby, phone call.

10:18.117 --> 10:19.076
Who is it?

10:19.160 --> 10:20.953
I don't know, some chick named Mallory.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.955
Cherry Bang?

10:23.372 --> 10:24.206
[Cherry] <i>Yeah.</i>

10:24.749 --> 10:26.751
That can't possibly be your real name.

10:27.251 --> 10:28.461
I'm sorry, do I know you?

10:28.544 --> 10:30.713
[Mallory] <i>Got your name</i>
<i>from Glen Klitnick.</i>

10:30.796 --> 10:33.132
<i>They're developing a show</i>
<i>called </i>Chambers and Gold,

10:33.215 --> 10:37.011
it's essentially <i>Cagney & Lacey,</i>
but with a black girl and a Jew.

10:37.595 --> 10:39.472
Anyway, we'd like to bring you in.

10:40.056 --> 10:40.890
Seriously?

10:40.973 --> 10:43.059
<i>If you want the sides,</i>
<i>come down to my office.</i>

10:43.142 --> 10:45.895
<i>The audition is tomorrow. 6464 Sunset.</i>

10:47.897 --> 10:48.898
[chuckles]

10:49.023 --> 10:49.982
What was that?

10:51.692 --> 10:53.194
Think I just got an audition.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.905
[Stacey] ...don't eat cantaloupe.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.573
-[chuckling]
-[chattering]

11:01.661 --> 11:02.912
[Melrose] Oh, hey.

11:03.579 --> 11:05.414
It's the Little Match Girl.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.631

-He's not poor. He's broke.

There's a difference.

11:17.593 --> 11:18.427
[clears throat]

11:18.677 --> 11:20.721
Sam, can we go talk for a sec?

11:20.805 --> 11:23.891
Whatever you gotta say,
you can say it in front of the girls.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.314
Well, I spoke to my mother...

11:31.690 --> 11:34.193
and I tried, I begged.

11:35.778 --> 11:37.822
-Wasn't easy.
-It "wasn't easy"?

11:38.656 --> 11:42.243
We cleaned dead skin out of upholstery
to try and keep this thing afloat.

11:42.326 --> 11:43.160
Really?

11:44.453 --> 11:45.788
Well, how much did you make?

11:47.456 --> 11:49.625
Two hundred and eighty-seven dollars.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.293
That's it?

11:52.169 --> 11:53.712
I haven't counted the change yet.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.177
So we'll have another car wash.

12:01.011 --> 12:04.473
We'll do a car wash every day
until we raise enough money,

12:04.557 --> 12:06.725
until every car in this state is shining.

12:07.476 --> 12:10.229
-Because we have to do something.
-[Melrose] Yeah.

12:10.312 --> 12:12.815
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And we'll step up our game this time.

12:12.898 --> 12:13.941
And go topless.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.902
My mom's having a fund-raiser.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.949
-For women's wrestling?
-It doesn't matter what it's for,

12:22.032 --> 12:24.452
it's a room full of rich people
with open checkbooks.

12:25.453 --> 12:28.456
If we crash it, I bet we can walk out
of there with something.

Why are you all dressed
like fancy Mormons?

We didn't have a lot of options.

Mm.

Hey, Gary. What a turnout tonight, huh?

12:56.859 --> 12:59.528
I'm sorry, Sebastian,
you're on the list plus one, not 20.

12:59.612 --> 13:03.240
No, no, no. These are the... the girls.
The former drug addicts?

two months ago,

13:17.046 --> 13:19.006
she was selling her body for crack.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.927
Now she's training every day,
living in a halfway house.

13:23.010 --> 13:25.221
She came here tonight to tell her story.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.639
-Yeah, I--
-Through a translator,

13:26.722 --> 13:28.224
because she doesn't speak English.

-Okay.

don't talk to anybody. Steal nothing.

-You certainly wear a lot of makeup.
-Oh, thank you...

15:49.031 --> 15:49.865
[musician 1] Mm.

15:49.949 --> 15:53.452
It's a semi-autobiographical,
psycho-sexual, time-travel drama.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.204
What does that mean?

15:57.122 --> 15:58.457
All right, I'll tell ya.

15:59.166 --> 16:01.001
It's about a boy, this all-American kid,

16:01.085 --> 16:04.630
can't stop jerking off to fantasies
about having sex with his mother.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.216
Right. It makes him hate himself.

16:07.299 --> 16:11.345
Right? So, he builds a time machine
to go into the future

16:11.428 --> 16:15.140
where she's old and hideous
so he can escape his Oedipal impulses.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.476
But... All right?

16:17.559 --> 16:21.772
Here's the "but."
He puts the wrong date in the machine,

16:21.855 --> 16:26.026
and he goes back in time instead
to the 1950s,

16:26.110 --> 16:30.364
where she's just a horny teenager,
and she spends the rest of the movie

16:30.447 --> 16:32.324
just trying to fuck him instead
of his dad.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.827
Lookit, I've seen that movie.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.081
No, you haven't. I haven't made it.
It's called <i>Mothers and Lovers.</i>

16:39.164 --> 16:42.167
Nah. Nah, bro,
it's called <i>Back to the Future.</i>

16:43.627 --> 16:47.297
Right, okay, so, you saw a movie
about a guy who goes back in time

16:47.381 --> 16:48.799
and almost has sex with his mother?

16:48.882 --> 16:49.800
Mm-hmm.

Yeah, man. Just opened.

Yeah, okay, but what if
I fall off the wagon right now

17:15.826 --> 17:17.828

by the end of the party?

we might not even have a show. So...

You always have.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.435
Ruth. [clears throat] Ruth Wilder.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.437
My housekeeper's name is Ruth.
She's wonderful.

23:59.521 --> 24:01.815
She cuts my fruit up into little pieces.

24:04.776 --> 24:09.281
You know, I've always been embarrassed
by Bash's obsession with wrestling.

24:10.073 --> 24:14.202
I've been embarrassed by a lot of things
my son chooses to spend his time doing...

24:15.412 --> 24:19.583
but wrestling always sounded like...
pure trash.

24:21.376 --> 24:22.836
But what you said...

24:24.671 --> 24:27.465
now that is the first time
I have come close

24:27.549 --> 24:30.635
to getting what all the fuss is about.

24:30.719 --> 24:31.595
So...

24:33.513 --> 24:34.514
thank you.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.897
Now, tell me again, what do you need?

24:43.148 --> 24:45.442
-Nine thousand for a venue?
-No.

24:45.525 --> 24:47.652
I'm not giving you any more money.

24:49.654 --> 24:54.242
But we do have a ballroom
at the Hayworth.

24:56.995 --> 25:01.291
-Unless that's too fancy for wrestling.
-[chuckles] No, it's great. It's perfect.

25:01.374 --> 25:02.375
Give me the checks.

25:06.421 --> 25:08.673
-You should hug her.
-No, we don't do that.

25:10.550 --> 25:14.804
I just work on my shit
so fucking long and then, boom.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.890
Someone else gets there first.

25:18.767 --> 25:24.064
I mean, it's like why bother
even trying to make anything

25:24.147 --> 25:25.523
that you really care about?

25:29.277 --> 25:30.779
Because that's what you do.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.116
[scoffs]

25:36.034 --> 25:41.623
You're probably the only one
who still cares about my work.

25:43.083 --> 25:43.917
I do.

25:44.960 --> 25:47.003
-And I--
-I'm gonna stop trying, you know?

25:47.087 --> 25:48.588
And just, like, fuck it.

25:49.631 --> 25:52.050
Right?
I mean, it's not about the next thing,

25:52.133 --> 25:54.844
because the next fucking thing
never happens.

25:57.681 --> 25:59.849
It's just about whatever's
in front of you.

26:05.188 --> 26:06.273
You are pretty.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.196
I don't even know if you're over 18.

26:14.990 --> 26:15.824
But I don't care.

26:17.284 --> 26:19.244
-Oh, my God.
-What? Whoa, whoa!

26:19.327 --> 26:20.453
-Oh, my God.
-Honey,

26:20.537 --> 26:22.289
you've been following me like a puppy.

26:22.372 --> 26:23.790
I am your daughter. I'm--

26:24.958 --> 26:25.792
What?

26:26.584 --> 26:29.212
My mother is Rosalie Biagi
from Sacramento.

26:29.421 --> 26:30.922
[shuddering]

26:33.967 --> 26:34.926
No.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.304
I never lived in Sacramento.

26:37.387 --> 26:40.432
You were at a Black Panther rally,
you got kicked out, and...

26:40.890 --> 26:43.893
you went to her bar
and you went home with her.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.483
Oh...

[Justine sighs]

26:53.028 --> 26:54.070
Shit.

27:04.247 --> 27:05.248
All right.

27:05.999 --> 27:07.417
So, what the fuck do you want?

27:08.418 --> 27:10.962
Do you want money?
Do you want bone marrow?

27:12.797 --> 27:15.216
-No, I...
-What?

27:20.180 --> 27:21.014
[sighs]

27:25.935 --> 27:27.479
Stop fucking looking at me.

27:46.873 --> 27:47.707
Come on.
