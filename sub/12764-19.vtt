00:01.061 --> 00:02.892
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:02.930 --> 00:06.491
- I don't remember taking this.
- It's not us. That's Adam.

00:06.534 --> 00:09.231
I have to find her.
I have to know who this woman is.

00:09.271 --> 00:11.068
Brian told me about
the girl in the picture, Sarah.

00:11.106 --> 00:14.337
He said he created me from Sarah's
genetic material after she died.

00:14.376 --> 00:18.074
- How sweet is this?
- That's awesome. You're awesome.

00:18.114 --> 00:19.706
You're kind of awesome, too.

00:19.749 --> 00:21.615
- Get away from me.
- Hey, whoa!

00:21.652 --> 00:23.414
- Stay away from me!
- Oh! Aah!

00:23.452 --> 00:27.287
- You know him?
- Yeah. He's my T.A.

00:27.324 --> 00:30.885
- You're arrogant and conceited.
- And you're bitter and hostile.

00:30.928 --> 00:33.158
There's so much
we don't know about each other.

00:33.197 --> 00:34.688
I want to know everything about you.

00:34.766 --> 00:37.257
I want to know everything
about you, too.

00:37.335 --> 00:39.860
I don't want you to see Kyle anymore.

00:39.938 --> 00:42.168
He's the only one that understands
what it's like to be me.

00:42.207 --> 00:44.369
He doesn't believe in you.
Not the way that I do.

00:44.443 --> 00:47.036
They just don't think
you're as good as Kyle.

00:47.078 --> 00:48.671
They're wrong. You can be better.

00:48.714 --> 00:52.845
Don't forget, I am more like you
than any of these people here.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.944
More than the Tragers, more than Amanda.

00:54.987 --> 00:57.218
I thought you said
Adam was dead.

00:57.290 --> 00:59.588
I scattered his ashes.

00:59.659 --> 01:01.355
Adam!

01:03.029 --> 01:04.690
Hello, Kyle.

01:08.769 --> 01:12.432
<i>The human body
has its own built-in repair kit.</i>

01:12.473 --> 01:14.806
<i>Our response to injury is automatic.</i>

01:14.877 --> 01:18.404
<i>The skin is torn, the brain
activates platelets in the blood.</i>

01:18.480 --> 01:22.007
<i>Drawn to the injury,
the blood forms a clot.</i>

01:22.050 --> 01:24.986
But you have greater control
of your brain.

01:25.021 --> 01:28.980
You can isolate the platelets
and direct them to an injury sooner,

01:29.025 --> 01:30.959
and heal faster.

01:32.395 --> 01:34.489
That's what you did after you were shot.

01:34.565 --> 01:38.899
Well, what took me months,
with your gifts, may only take weeks.

01:38.936 --> 01:41.370
I can't believe you're here
standing in front of me.

01:41.406 --> 01:44.068
Now you know anything is possible.

01:48.713 --> 01:51.046
Draw the oil through the water...

01:52.051 --> 01:54.678
...like platelets through your blood.

02:01.794 --> 02:04.559
<i>What Baylin was teaching me
may have been true for wounds</i>

02:04.598 --> 02:08.899
<i>that pierce the skin, but I also knew
of ruptures and breaks between people</i>

02:08.937 --> 02:13.033
<i>that were easier to cause than to cure,
like my friendship with Jessi.</i>

02:13.074 --> 02:17.306
<i>But that was a rift I still
didn't know how to heal.</i>

02:22.451 --> 02:24.851
I'm glad to see
you've kept yourself sharp.

02:25.154 --> 02:27.349
Foss has trained you well.

02:31.094 --> 02:33.619
Adam, I need to talk to you.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.362
About Jessi.

02:36.399 --> 02:38.492
You made it seem
like I was the only one.

02:38.568 --> 02:41.265
Well, I thought you were.

02:41.339 --> 02:45.332
According to Latnok, Brian Taylor's been
acting in his own interest for years.

02:45.376 --> 02:47.537
- I just didn't realize it.
- But you did.

02:47.611 --> 02:49.842
You sent me that message
not to trust him.

02:49.915 --> 02:54.409
Based on a hunch.
I had no idea Taylor was still

02:54.453 --> 02:57.617
conducting the experiment
after I created you.

02:57.690 --> 02:59.850
- Neither did Latnok.
- But Taylor is Latnok.

02:59.891 --> 03:02.383
Not anymore.

03:02.428 --> 03:05.693
You may have noticed
he's no longer wearing the ring.

03:05.732 --> 03:08.132
Once I recovered and Latnok
put the pieces together,

03:08.167 --> 03:12.468
he was stripped of his affiliation.
They don't approve of what he did.

03:13.607 --> 03:17.634
- Jessi should've never been created.
- But she was.

03:17.678 --> 03:20.580
And all she wants is to feel like
she matters to somebody.

03:20.615 --> 03:22.674
- You can't turn your backs on her.
- We're not.

03:22.717 --> 03:26.881
On the contrary, we're all very
concerned about Jessi's well-being.

03:26.921 --> 03:30.221
In fact, we're looking to you
to take care of her.

03:34.730 --> 03:36.857
That hasn't been easy.

03:37.434 --> 03:39.095
And she's mad at me now.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.433
You have to keep trying.
I know Brian Taylor.

03:41.504 --> 03:45.134
He's gonna push her too hard to prove
that it wasn't a mistake to create her.

03:45.175 --> 03:49.407
And if Jessi is anything at all like
her mother, she'll get carried away.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.142
She won't know when to stop.

03:56.021 --> 03:59.684
I'm increasing your incline
and speed by five percent.

03:59.725 --> 04:01.158
Fine.

04:02.227 --> 04:04.219
- You sure?
- I said I'm fine.

04:04.264 --> 04:05.992
All right.

04:13.239 --> 04:15.298
- Move it.
- There's no water in it.

04:15.341 --> 04:17.002
I can't manipulate the polarity.

04:17.043 --> 04:19.308
You've mastered that.
Challenge yourself.

04:19.346 --> 04:22.577
- It's impossible.
- Not for you.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:43.139 --> 04:46.267
- How was that?
- Incredible.

04:56.553 --> 04:58.545
- You need a break?
- No.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.289
I'm just getting started.

05:17.811 --> 05:20.405
I think you do more homework
than your students.

05:20.447 --> 05:23.678
I'm the teacher. I have to be
the smartest one in the class.

05:23.750 --> 05:25.719
Speaking of which, how'd it go?

05:25.786 --> 05:29.153
With Adam? Good.
He's teaching me about healing.

05:29.190 --> 05:31.784
He healed himself from a gunshot wound.
I'm sure he has a lot to offer.

05:31.826 --> 05:34.022
You know, we'd really love to meet him.

05:35.463 --> 05:38.763
Thanks. I don't think
he's comfortable around people.

05:38.800 --> 05:40.529
He's spent a lot of time on his own.

05:40.569 --> 05:43.130
Well, no pressure.
Whenever he's ready.

05:43.173 --> 05:46.073
He said it's imperative
that I reconnect with Jessi.

05:47.677 --> 05:50.077
You think we could go
to U-Dub with you tomorrow?

05:50.146 --> 05:52.171
U-Dub? Why?

05:52.215 --> 05:54.547
Turns out Sarah
was a student there with Adam.

05:54.617 --> 05:57.178
I think Jessi'd like to see
where her mother went to school.

05:57.221 --> 05:59.815
- It's fine with me.
- Great.

06:06.565 --> 06:08.725
What?

06:09.467 --> 06:11.958
Kyle's coming to work with me.
That never ends well.

06:37.198 --> 06:38.790
What are you doing?

06:40.302 --> 06:43.361
Trying to put a lesson Adam Baylin
taught me into practice.

06:43.404 --> 06:47.341
- Is he teaching you how to shave?
- Heal a wound.

06:47.376 --> 06:50.402
Whoa! Cool.

06:51.347 --> 06:54.112
Go ahead. Seal it up.

06:56.953 --> 06:58.921
- Is it working?
- Shh.

06:59.522 --> 07:02.424
Hey, if you pull this off
and keep practicing,

07:02.460 --> 07:05.827
maybe you can give
curing Andy's cancer a shot.

07:05.896 --> 07:08.364
I can't even get this
small cut to stop bleeding.

07:08.432 --> 07:10.832
Yeah. What's up with that?

07:11.903 --> 07:16.203
- Do you want to try?
- Draw my own blood? Are you crazy?

07:44.072 --> 07:46.097
What are you doing here?

07:49.210 --> 07:52.703
- I needed to talk to you.
- Did you ever hear of a phone?

07:52.748 --> 07:55.648
- You won't take my calls.
- How about the front door?

07:55.684 --> 07:58.711
I'm being direct, like you.

08:00.256 --> 08:02.350
Can I come in?

08:11.969 --> 08:15.769
- I hope I didn't startle you.
- I heard you coming.

08:16.607 --> 08:19.099
It's hard to be quiet
when you're scaling a building.

08:20.478 --> 08:24.973
- I am. I've done it lots of times.
- Oh.

08:26.485 --> 08:29.477
Well, it's tricky.
The ledges are narrow.

08:32.058 --> 08:33.491
So what do you want?

08:35.528 --> 08:38.587
Every time you've tried to talk
to me lately, I've put you off.

08:38.664 --> 08:41.692
- I want to make it up to you.
- Don't bother.

08:41.736 --> 08:44.671
It's not a bother.
I've thought about what you said.

08:44.772 --> 08:47.832
You're right. There is no one
more like me than you.

08:49.878 --> 08:53.779
You climbed all the way up here
just to tell me that?

08:55.150 --> 08:56.845
I want to tell you Adam's recovered.

08:56.918 --> 09:01.151
He's told me a way we could
find out about our history, about Sarah.

09:01.190 --> 09:03.852
Sarah? How?

09:10.400 --> 09:12.995
- Is this where she studied?
- Could be.

09:13.070 --> 09:15.129
- Well, what did Adam tell you?
- Not much.

09:15.172 --> 09:18.107
He thought we should discover
things about her on our own.

09:18.142 --> 09:21.806
He said we could start with articles
from the archives of the school paper.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.780
- She made the paper?
- Uh-huh.

09:23.815 --> 09:26.443
- What do you think she did?
- Let's find out.

09:31.991 --> 09:33.015
Hi.

09:33.058 --> 09:36.619
- Hey, you working today?
- Worse. Prom committee.

09:36.662 --> 09:38.995
Since when are you not
excited about a committee?

09:39.032 --> 09:41.193
Thought you had the word
tattooed on your...

09:41.234 --> 09:42.997
I'm not gonna let you finish that.

09:43.069 --> 09:46.095
My mom's decided I need to keep
extracurricular obligations

09:46.139 --> 09:49.268
that might look good on college
applications, but not let me go to prom.

09:49.343 --> 09:51.503
- Ouch.
- Bummer.

09:51.545 --> 09:54.538
Since you're in charge,
can you do something about the music?

09:54.615 --> 09:57.483
- What about it?
- I don't know. Make it not suck.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.111
Or maybe just suck less.

09:59.154 --> 10:02.248
Let's see. I have less than four weeks
to book a venue, plan a theme,

10:02.291 --> 10:04.191
decorations, food, transportation,

10:04.226 --> 10:07.321
security and photographers
for an event I won't be attending.

10:07.363 --> 10:10.423
I'll be sure to make the music
my top priority.

10:11.601 --> 10:14.035
When did Pollyanna
learn to be facetious?

10:14.103 --> 10:16.094
Stop it.

10:17.907 --> 10:20.240
She was amazing, brilliant.

10:21.679 --> 10:23.773
No wonder
she and Adam were friends.

10:23.815 --> 10:25.873
I'll bet she was smarter.

10:27.853 --> 10:30.378
I don't know. But she was special.

10:31.656 --> 10:35.854
All those honors and awards.
She was the best.

10:40.399 --> 10:42.128
What else is there?

10:44.871 --> 10:49.205
"Honor student sabotages
biochem final."

10:49.242 --> 10:51.973
"The Biochemistry department
cancelled the final exam

10:52.012 --> 10:55.073
after discovering honor student
Sarah Emerson stole the test

10:55.149 --> 10:58.049
and vandalized the lecture hall
in the science building."

10:58.085 --> 10:59.144
Vandalized it.

11:00.989 --> 11:02.650
Where's the lecture hall?

11:16.372 --> 11:20.241
- Is your upper lymph node swollen?
- No.

11:20.277 --> 11:24.077
- What about on this side?
- Eye on the prize. Focus.

11:28.085 --> 11:30.610
- You feel hot.
- Thank you.

11:31.589 --> 11:34.423
I mean, you feel hot, as in fever.

11:35.594 --> 11:38.062
When I said I wanted to play doctor,
I was expecting

11:38.096 --> 11:41.224
inappropriate over-the-shirt action,
not J. Trager, mini-MD.

11:41.266 --> 11:44.236
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Be grabby.

11:44.270 --> 11:46.669
You sure you're OK?

11:46.705 --> 11:50.335
If your future self travels back in time
to this moment, he'll slap you.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.641
I am here on your lap bringing the sexy,

11:52.680 --> 11:56.342
and your mind and hands are everywhere
but where they should be.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.113
I can't stop thinking about
your test tomorrow. Aren't you?

11:59.153 --> 12:02.885
Thinking about whether I still have
cancer or not? Never entered my mind.

12:05.225 --> 12:10.255
You know what? Forget it.

12:10.299 --> 12:12.732
- Don't get mad.
- All I want is a diversion.

12:12.767 --> 12:16.795
- I'm just a diversion?
- You know what I mean.

12:19.942 --> 12:21.967
I think we need help.

12:27.351 --> 12:30.286
- Hi, friend.
- Hi.

12:30.320 --> 12:33.290
- Whatchya doin'?
- Studying.

12:33.324 --> 12:37.090
- Why?
- Nothing else to do.

12:37.128 --> 12:42.362
Come on. Things aren't that boring
around here, are they?

12:42.401 --> 12:44.868
You miss fighting the evil empire.

12:44.902 --> 12:48.498
- I do not.
- You totally do.

12:50.677 --> 12:55.478
I totally do. I'm bored out of my mind.
I'm not plotting against bad guys,

12:55.515 --> 12:57.881
I'm not playing basketball,
I'm not having sex.

12:57.951 --> 13:00.443
- You're not having sex?
- Not the point.

13:00.521 --> 13:02.852
Sorry.

13:03.958 --> 13:06.950
- I just feel...
- Restless?

13:07.028 --> 13:11.988
Sort of. Do you have a Lori word
handy for things like this?

13:12.033 --> 13:14.594
You think those little
nuggets of gold grow on trees?

13:17.406 --> 13:20.569
We'll find you an adventure,
I promise.

13:32.156 --> 13:35.455
Well, whatever she did
is long gone by now.

13:37.561 --> 13:39.587
No, it's not.

13:41.099 --> 13:43.623
Look. She drew the Latnok symbol.

13:49.475 --> 13:52.808
What does that have to do with
canceling the biochemistry exam?

13:52.845 --> 13:55.507
Look closely.
She gave everyone the answers.

14:03.490 --> 14:05.924
Why would the school
leave that up there?

14:05.993 --> 14:09.052
The article said the professors
couldn't help being impressed.

14:09.129 --> 14:11.291
They didn't have the heart
to paint over it.

14:11.332 --> 14:13.823
My mother was awesome.

14:23.778 --> 14:26.179
Since you guys are here,
I could use your help.

14:26.215 --> 14:29.811
Here's the deal. Each one of these
computers have been loaded up with

14:29.853 --> 14:32.754
the security encryption programs
you've been working on.

14:32.822 --> 14:34.653
But today I have a little surprise.

14:34.724 --> 14:38.320
Two students from Beachwood
will be trying to hack those programs.

14:38.395 --> 14:41.295
- Isn't Beachwood a high school?
- Yes, it is.

14:41.331 --> 14:43.892
You have a problem
with that, Alessandri?

14:45.703 --> 14:48.433
No offense, Stephen, but the NSA
would have a hard time

14:48.472 --> 14:51.840
cracking my sub-laced elliptically
curved 384-bit module system

14:51.910 --> 14:55.813
- with a 256-bit encryption.
- Did you actually just say that?

14:55.882 --> 14:58.111
Yes. Why?

14:58.150 --> 15:00.847
Well, she might be in high school,
but she's a girl,

15:00.920 --> 15:04.357
and she's talking to you, which means
you're way ahead of the game.

15:04.424 --> 15:07.517
So don't blow it.

15:07.560 --> 15:11.088
All right, Kyle. Is there anything
you and Jessi need besides quiet?

15:11.131 --> 15:13.531
- A timer.
- For what?

15:13.567 --> 15:15.899
To judge performance
and to see who wins.

15:15.936 --> 15:18.064
Why is that important?

15:18.139 --> 15:20.573
Because that's how
you find out who's the best.

15:22.210 --> 15:25.008
I guess a timer will be fine.

15:27.716 --> 15:32.676
OK. Ready, set, go.

15:35.392 --> 15:38.485
Don't be shocked. We're about to do
something out of character.

15:38.527 --> 15:39.825
- What?
- Volunteer.

15:39.863 --> 15:43.697
- For prom committee?
- More like a subcommittee.

15:43.733 --> 15:46.201
We're here to help you
with your music woes.

15:46.269 --> 15:48.795
There's this amazing deejay
who spins out of U.W.

15:48.840 --> 15:52.003
His mash-ups are ridiculous.
He's got this whole following online.

15:52.043 --> 15:54.409
You should read up on him.
Djspinbrandt.com.

15:54.478 --> 15:58.279
- He is fabulous.
- Sounds fine. So what's the catch?

15:59.451 --> 16:01.817
A little matter of a
thousand-dollar deposit.

16:01.854 --> 16:04.880
But if you write us a check,
we'll book him for you.

16:04.957 --> 16:08.018
Want me to give you 1,000 dollars
for someone I've never heard of?

16:08.094 --> 16:11.495
No offense, but the fact you haven't
heard of him is an endorsement.

16:11.531 --> 16:13.999
- Hilary.
- No, she's right.

16:14.033 --> 16:16.628
When it comes to that kind of stuff,
I'm behind the game.

16:16.704 --> 16:21.573
Facetious and self-aware.
I think I might start liking you.

16:21.609 --> 16:24.169
Given the fact you had sex
with my ex-boyfriend

16:24.279 --> 16:26.179
while we were dating, I don't care.

16:26.214 --> 16:28.682
Facetious, self-aware and spicy.

16:28.717 --> 16:32.346
Anyway, SpinBrandt's working
tonight at a bar on campus.

16:32.454 --> 16:35.946
We could go there and track him down
and convince him to do it.

16:35.991 --> 16:37.584
I can't go to a bar.

16:37.660 --> 16:41.562
They don't start carding until after 7.
It's a regular restaurant before.

16:41.597 --> 16:44.327
We could go, book our guy...
Be out before we're illegal.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.631
- Even your mom can't find fault.
- Believe me,

16:46.703 --> 16:48.671
my mom can find fault in anything.

16:48.705 --> 16:53.904
Well, then, just write us a blank check,
and we'll take care of everything.

16:56.214 --> 16:59.843
- We're gonna need a ride.
- I've got it covered.

17:10.296 --> 17:12.856
I just cracked the fifth program.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.790
- Me, too.
- Getting a little worried?

17:16.835 --> 17:19.566
- Hmm? No, not at all.
- You should be.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.536
Kyle, how's it going?

17:23.577 --> 17:26.238
Putting together a second order
differential attack

17:26.279 --> 17:29.443
- to focus on the weak keys.
- Weak keys. There are none.

17:29.517 --> 17:32.976
Actually, there's no way to check
for them before doing the key expansion.

17:34.922 --> 17:40.191
- I'm locked out.
- Behold the victor!

17:40.229 --> 17:43.391
Not by you. By Jessi.

17:45.034 --> 17:47.127
Done.

17:56.780 --> 17:59.180
- Your program's toast.
- What happened?

17:59.216 --> 18:01.844
- I'm not sure.
- Well, after I hacked in,

18:01.885 --> 18:05.014
I went back and reverse engineered
the encryption so Kyle couldn't enter.

18:05.056 --> 18:06.352
Sweet.

18:10.829 --> 18:13.458
That was really nice of you
to do that for Jessi.

18:13.499 --> 18:15.489
- Do what?
- Let her win.

18:15.533 --> 18:17.832
I didn't. She beat me.

18:17.870 --> 18:20.362
I knew I recognized
your face from somewhere.

18:20.407 --> 18:22.738
- What do you mean?
- You're famous.

18:25.412 --> 18:30.578
Just for the record, I want to say
I think this is a very bad idea.

18:30.618 --> 18:32.676
Mom, we're out of options.

18:32.719 --> 18:36.554
Teetering on the brink of a relational
train wreck. You are our last hope.

18:38.227 --> 18:40.456
OK.

18:40.495 --> 18:44.489
- So what's on your mind?
- She never takes anything seriously.

18:44.533 --> 18:47.866
- It's all a big joke to her.
- He's like a TV with only one channel.

18:47.903 --> 18:51.168
- It's not even a good one.
- Not asking for soap-opera seriousness.

18:51.206 --> 18:52.640
I have to jump on him
to get him to touch me.

18:52.675 --> 18:54.643
That's all she thinks about.
I'm not a piece of meat.

18:54.677 --> 18:57.111
On a scale of 1 to 10,
know what our make-out level is?

18:57.147 --> 18:58.171
OK, stop.

19:04.187 --> 19:06.986
We have some work to do.

19:08.659 --> 19:10.651
So why am I famous?

19:10.695 --> 19:13.595
Not you exactly.
Unless, besides hacking computers,

19:13.631 --> 19:15.964
- you've managed to master time travel.
- No.

19:16.001 --> 19:18.300
- Not yet.
- Funny.

19:18.371 --> 19:21.305
But if it's not me,
then why are we here?

19:21.373 --> 19:25.777
Well, I just wanted to see if the sequel
matches up to the original.

19:29.582 --> 19:32.950
Oh... It's Sarah.

19:49.405 --> 19:52.738
Can't believe she played pool.

19:52.842 --> 19:57.745
I play pool. Lots of people play pool.
Sarah was an artist.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.909
- What's straight pool?
- It's called 14.1 continuous.

20:01.017 --> 20:03.577
Considered to be the truest test
of a billiard skill.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.985
There's 15 balls in a rack.

20:05.021 --> 20:07.422
It's shooting as many
as you can until you miss.

20:07.525 --> 20:10.982
The world record
was 625 balls sunk in a row.

20:11.027 --> 20:13.496
Legend has it Sarah shot 626.

20:13.564 --> 20:15.498
Six in the corner.

20:19.036 --> 20:21.505
World record. Wow.

20:21.573 --> 20:23.404
Actually, she disappeared,

20:23.442 --> 20:26.536
according to the story,
before anyone could really verify it.

20:26.612 --> 20:28.580
Why would she do that?

20:28.614 --> 20:32.051
We should go. Stephen's
office hours will be over soon.

20:32.085 --> 20:33.848
Eight in the side.

20:36.656 --> 20:40.115
No. I want to play pool.

20:40.161 --> 20:42.186
We don't really have much time, Jessi.

20:42.229 --> 20:45.630
Then we better get started.

20:46.634 --> 20:50.537
Excuse me. Thanks. You want to play?

20:56.679 --> 20:59.704
You call this an adventure?

20:59.781 --> 21:01.682
Come on. U-Dub?

21:01.717 --> 21:05.347
The return to the scene
of your first secret mission.

21:05.422 --> 21:08.584
Where you spent the night with some guy,
and I stood at the side

21:08.624 --> 21:11.458
of the road waiting for Kyle
to come back out of the woods

21:11.495 --> 21:14.954
- and not tell me anything?
- The memory was better in my head.

21:14.999 --> 21:17.466
- Coming in?
- No. Gonna go watch the team practice,

21:17.501 --> 21:19.629
see if I can grab
a moment with the coach.

21:19.704 --> 21:22.970
- Call me when you're ready to go.
- Will do.

21:23.943 --> 21:25.933
- Let's go.
- Bye, Declan.

21:26.010 --> 21:30.448
- Come on, girls, let's do this.
- I better not get in trouble for this.

21:33.619 --> 21:35.644
- Yeah!
- College bars.

21:35.688 --> 21:38.817
- Good times.
- Hey, is that Jessi?

21:38.858 --> 21:41.326
Six in the corner.

21:42.796 --> 21:44.821
Oh, no.

21:46.834 --> 21:49.199
- What's the matter?
- I can't go out there.

21:49.302 --> 21:51.464
If she sees me here,
she'll bust me to my mom.

21:51.539 --> 21:53.973
Come on.
She's not that evil, is she?

21:54.008 --> 21:56.477
- Alrighty, then.
- I'll wait in here.

21:56.511 --> 21:58.911
- You guys go handle the deejay.
- Um, yeah.

21:58.947 --> 22:00.938
We kind of have a problem with that now.

22:01.016 --> 22:04.714
- What do you mean?
- He doesn't go on until 7:30.

22:04.821 --> 22:09.155
- And they start carding at seven.
- Not a problem, little Brownies.

22:09.225 --> 22:13.287
We'll hang out in the bathroom until
7:00, then sneak back out to the bar.

22:13.364 --> 22:15.228
They only card at the door.

22:15.298 --> 22:18.132
That's a terrible plan. Will it work?

22:18.168 --> 22:21.730
- Trust me. I'm a professional.
- I don't think we should do this.

22:21.773 --> 22:24.104
We've come this far.
An extra hour won't kill us.

22:24.141 --> 22:26.337
Please, please, please, please, please!

22:26.378 --> 22:30.110
We're so close to musical victory
and prom greatness.

22:32.917 --> 22:35.944
I've totally just succumbed
to peer pressure.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.182
Welcome to our worlds.

22:39.091 --> 22:42.060
OK, relationships are hard work.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.824
Tell me about it.

22:43.864 --> 22:47.264
And communication can be the hardest.

22:47.300 --> 22:51.601
What many couples do is share
private thoughts on a regular basis.

22:51.638 --> 22:55.631
It's a good way
of maintaining their... intimacy.

22:55.676 --> 22:57.907
Thanks to me losing it
at the Madacorp picnic,

22:57.945 --> 23:00.345
she knows everything
there is to know about me.

23:00.415 --> 23:03.680
- That's depressing.
- Andy.

23:03.751 --> 23:08.052
I want you to share with Josh
something you've never told him.

23:15.098 --> 23:17.794
Everyone thinks that "Andy"
is short for "Andrea."

23:19.370 --> 23:22.065
And I let people think that,

23:22.105 --> 23:27.305
but in actuality,
my moms named me Andromeda.

23:27.345 --> 23:31.008
Andromeda? They named
you after a TV show?

23:31.048 --> 23:34.212
It's from Greek mythology, moron.
It means ruler of all men.

23:34.252 --> 23:37.050
Better than having an
O-Town poster hanging in my bedroom.

23:37.122 --> 23:38.714
You promised you'd never mention that.

23:38.790 --> 23:41.225
If the tight pants fit,
wear 'em, boy band groupie.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.728
- You are such a liar!
- You are.

23:43.763 --> 23:46.698
- We are so done!
- Right. We are so done! For good!

23:46.733 --> 23:50.226
- That's it. I'm outta here.
- Enough. You, out.

23:50.270 --> 23:53.033
You can't do that.
You're supposed to be our therapist.

23:53.072 --> 23:56.634
Right now, I'm your mom
and Andy's therapist. Move it.

23:59.781 --> 24:03.478
Tough love. Cool.

24:05.720 --> 24:10.089
- 326.
- Seven ball in the corner.

24:17.767 --> 24:21.225
- You seem to know a lot about Sarah.
- When you spend enough time in here,

24:21.270 --> 24:24.399
you hear all the stories.
She's a legend in the science building.

24:24.441 --> 24:26.534
You should check out
this picture she drew.

24:26.576 --> 24:27.702
We saw it.

24:27.744 --> 24:30.144
- It's pretty awesome, right?
- Yeah.

24:30.214 --> 24:31.772
Do you know what happened to her?

24:32.784 --> 24:35.252
Yeah. It's sad.

24:35.286 --> 24:38.050
I heard that she just lost it.

24:39.324 --> 24:41.383
She went nuts.

24:43.161 --> 24:46.598
She became obsessed.
She had to be the best at everything.

24:46.632 --> 24:48.828
And, supposedly, it killed her.

24:50.969 --> 24:53.131
Tell me more.

24:53.173 --> 24:55.801
What is that?

24:55.875 --> 24:58.470
That's Josh's third birthday party.

24:58.546 --> 25:00.877
He was going through his Tarzan phase.

25:00.914 --> 25:05.876
I can see. Everything.

25:11.226 --> 25:15.856
I know how special he is,
and I know how much he cares.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.161
But?

25:19.735 --> 25:23.500
I have not one, but two moms.

25:23.572 --> 25:26.701
I have three
different doctors making sure

25:26.742 --> 25:30.304
I don't do one teeny, tiny thing wrong.

25:30.347 --> 25:32.439
I don't need my
boyfriend to do it, too.

25:34.418 --> 25:38.515
We don't go anywhere
or stay out too late

25:38.590 --> 25:41.753
or do stupid things just to do them.

25:42.694 --> 25:45.595
- I'm...
- You're what?

25:45.630 --> 25:47.758
I'm going in for my checkup tomorrow.

25:47.833 --> 25:50.232
It'll tell me if I'm better or not.

25:51.737 --> 25:56.368
And if I'm not,
things are gonna get real bad.

25:56.442 --> 26:00.004
I'm afraid he's gonna forget
how much fun we have together.

26:00.046 --> 26:02.844
I don't want to be that sucky downer

26:02.916 --> 26:06.181
he has to hang out with after school
every day because he has to.

26:07.587 --> 26:10.557
I couldn't deal with that.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.726
This is ridiculous. It's past 6:30.

26:14.762 --> 26:18.392
- Maybe he's already setting up.
- I'll go check.

26:18.433 --> 26:20.458
God, I look pretty today.

26:22.337 --> 26:26.741
- Crap.
- Does your father know you're in a bar?

26:26.776 --> 26:28.801
I know that you
don't know me as anything

26:28.845 --> 26:32.303
other than the psychotic walking
mood swing who pepper-sprayed you,

26:32.348 --> 26:34.475
but could you pretend you didn't see me?

26:34.517 --> 26:37.146
Want me to not tell my new boss
his teenage daughter

26:37.187 --> 26:38.847
is hanging out at a college bar?

26:41.191 --> 26:42.453
What are you doing here?

26:42.493 --> 26:44.724
I'm trying to book the deejay
for an event.

26:44.763 --> 26:47.925
- What kind of event?
- You know, dance thing.

26:47.965 --> 26:50.434
- High school dance thing?
- Maybe.

26:50.468 --> 26:54.461
A prom! You want to ask a deejay who
spins at the biggest parties on campus

26:54.506 --> 26:56.974
- to do a high school prom?
- What's wrong with that?

26:57.042 --> 26:58.840
Well, for one, it's in high school.

26:58.945 --> 27:01.436
High school kids are, well, stupid.

27:02.848 --> 27:04.941
I'm in high school, jackass.

27:05.017 --> 27:07.919
Making a good case for why
I shouldn't bust you to your dad.

27:07.988 --> 27:09.888
Do whatever you want. Be a suck-up.

27:09.923 --> 27:13.120
Contribute to me being grounded
for the rest of high school,

27:13.160 --> 27:16.392
and then, maybe, when I come of age,
I will come down here legally

27:16.431 --> 27:18.490
and personally kick your ass.

27:22.403 --> 27:23.995
Ten in the corner.

27:37.654 --> 27:40.646
<i>Jessi seemed so focused, driven,</i>

27:40.690 --> 27:42.625
<i>and trying to be like Sarah.</i>

27:42.660 --> 27:47.120
<i>And I knew that Sarah's pushing too hard
is what got her into trouble.</i>

27:47.198 --> 27:50.326
- Jessi, we need to wait outside.
- I'm not going anywhere.

27:50.401 --> 27:53.370
- Jessi.
- No. Not until I lose.

27:53.404 --> 27:57.774
<i>To get Jessi to leave, I needed
to beat her at her own game.</i>

27:57.809 --> 27:59.743
OK, then.

28:00.779 --> 28:02.974
Play against me.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.378
I'll rack 'em up.

28:22.671 --> 28:26.664
- That means you're solids, man.
- Don't worry. He's got nothing on you.

28:35.383 --> 28:37.113
Wow, he's really good.

28:53.136 --> 28:55.867
If he sinks this ball, she's done.

29:11.658 --> 29:14.252
<i>I didn't know
what she was trying to prove</i>

29:14.294 --> 29:16.489
<i>or how she could do what I couldn't.</i>

29:20.067 --> 29:22.297
Hot professor alert.

29:22.336 --> 29:24.394
I just saw him
walking across the quad.

29:24.437 --> 29:27.464
I have never seen a teacher
with shoulders like that.

29:27.508 --> 29:30.945
And those cute little
laugh wrinkles, I just want to lick 'em.

29:32.713 --> 29:36.616
I think that we need to take
a class in software design.

29:36.651 --> 29:40.280
I'm sure Stephen Trager
can teach me plenty.

29:43.693 --> 29:45.820
OK, that's it.

29:45.895 --> 29:48.455
- Your dad's a total PILF.
- What's a PILF?

29:50.299 --> 29:54.293
- Professor I'd like to...
- Learn from.

29:54.371 --> 29:56.965
I'm calling Declan. We need to go.

29:57.007 --> 29:58.838
Why? We're safe.
It's almost seven.

29:58.876 --> 30:01.675
- The problem's gone.
- Along with my innocence.

30:01.746 --> 30:05.739
- Hey, yeah, we're ready.
- And what about the deejay?

30:05.784 --> 30:07.752
No prom music is worth
what I had to hear.

30:11.657 --> 30:12.714
Gross.

30:17.463 --> 30:19.932
Taking out the bad guys?

30:26.339 --> 30:28.274
What, you want to play?

30:30.811 --> 30:33.713
G-Force is your favorite game, right?
You're great at it.

30:33.781 --> 30:35.339
Well...

30:35.383 --> 30:38.284
Counseling is my game.
So here's the deal.

30:38.319 --> 30:42.017
If I can score a point off you
in your game, you let me do mine.

30:43.659 --> 30:47.151
First of all,
it's not a point, it's a kill.

30:47.229 --> 30:50.256
And I currently lead all level
45 shooters in online play.

30:50.300 --> 30:52.530
I honestly have no idea
what you just said.

30:53.837 --> 30:57.102
OK. OK, you're in.

30:57.140 --> 30:59.166
The screen on the left's yours.

31:02.245 --> 31:06.979
By the way, I just showed Andy
a few of the old family photo albums.

31:07.017 --> 31:08.178
Oh?

31:08.220 --> 31:11.553
She really enjoyed
your third birthday photos.

31:11.590 --> 31:16.085
- What? No, you didn't.
- I win!

31:16.128 --> 31:18.062
No fair.

31:18.097 --> 31:20.326
Those pics should've
been burned years ago.

31:20.433 --> 31:22.424
- I mean, I was naked, for God's sake.
- So?

31:22.468 --> 31:25.768
It was a cold day
and a pool party, remember?

31:25.839 --> 31:27.965
You told her I had
just left the pool, right?

31:28.040 --> 31:31.238
You were three. And she thought
those pictures were adorable.

31:31.278 --> 31:33.542
She did?

31:33.580 --> 31:36.981
You know, Andy appreciates
that you're concerned about her.

31:37.017 --> 31:39.316
She needs the fun-loving,
G-Force-playing,

31:39.354 --> 31:41.447
hilarious side of you, too.

31:43.458 --> 31:46.291
I guess I've been pretty boring lately.

31:47.463 --> 31:50.955
I mean, with all
the doctor stuff and studying.

31:51.000 --> 31:54.333
No, you're not gonna use this
as an excuse to get out of studying.

31:56.273 --> 31:58.741
So she really thinks
I'm all those things you said?

31:58.775 --> 32:01.175
She's not the only one.

32:06.350 --> 32:09.409
Only the eight ball left.
She gets that, she wins.

32:14.092 --> 32:15.252
Go for it.

32:16.928 --> 32:18.361
It's your turn.

32:18.397 --> 32:21.764
I know. I'm giving it to you.

32:39.586 --> 32:42.111
<i>Somehow,
she'd gotten stronger, better.</i>

32:42.156 --> 32:43.851
<i>But at a cost.</i>

32:45.493 --> 32:48.621
- You're bleeding.
- No. I'm fine. Try it again.

32:50.131 --> 32:51.962
- We're leaving. Jessi...
- No.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.970
- Hey. No means no, assface.
- I know what it means.

32:55.004 --> 32:56.164
Apparently, you don't.

32:56.205 --> 32:58.503
- We have to go.
- She'll leave when she wants to.

33:00.142 --> 33:03.874
OK, if that's the way it's gonna be.

33:05.315 --> 33:07.943
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- But I will.

33:11.722 --> 33:13.418
Move!

33:16.928 --> 33:19.021
- Get down!
- What the hell are you doing?

33:19.063 --> 33:21.998
I'm saving you. Your brother Kyle's
crazy friend instigated a brawl.

33:22.066 --> 33:24.227
- Kyle's here?
- I may not bust you to your dad,

33:24.268 --> 33:26.328
but I'm not letting you
get hospitalized.

33:26.372 --> 33:27.703
You choose now to be chivalrous.

33:27.773 --> 33:30.367
- You caught me on a bad day.
- What are we doing in here?

33:30.409 --> 33:33.674
- Hiding in my booth.
- I got that... Your booth?

33:33.712 --> 33:35.874
- That's what I said.
- You're DJ SpinBrandt?

33:35.915 --> 33:38.145
- And I don't do proms.
- Oh, my God!

33:38.184 --> 33:40.744
I can't believe I got into
this whole mess over you!

33:46.394 --> 33:49.454
Are you OK?

33:53.668 --> 33:56.569
Declan's facing off
against a super cute frat boy

33:56.605 --> 33:59.631
- wearing a lovely Marc Jacobs sweater.
- Jessi!

34:00.509 --> 34:03.035
- Amanda.
- Kyle!

34:06.049 --> 34:07.573
What are you doing here? You OK?

34:07.650 --> 34:10.176
- You're so my hero right now.
- Come on. Let's go.

34:11.721 --> 34:12.813
Let's go.

34:12.855 --> 34:15.916
I'm Hilary, and I'm in a bar fight.

34:21.065 --> 34:22.157
Hey.

34:23.802 --> 34:25.735
I'm sorry about what happened in there.

34:25.770 --> 34:28.237
- What happened?
- Nothing. I cut myself on glass.

34:28.273 --> 34:29.797
- Jessi.
- Kyle, it's fine.

34:29.841 --> 34:31.866
We'll find Stephen,
get you to a hospital.

34:31.909 --> 34:34.175
- No, I can fix it.
- You can't. And neither can I.

34:34.213 --> 34:36.181
Adam could.

34:39.452 --> 34:42.286
I bet with how smart
Sarah was, she could've, too.

34:42.322 --> 34:45.016
Jessi, you shouldn't push yourself.
You don't know...

34:47.994 --> 34:50.520
What don't I know?

34:53.033 --> 34:55.161
<i>Jessi was able to heal a wound.</i>

34:55.203 --> 35:00.437
<i>But keeping her safe and whole'd draw
on my ability to break through to her.</i>

35:00.509 --> 35:02.135
You don't know how Sarah died.

35:02.210 --> 35:04.702
She claimed she could
move things with her mind,

35:04.746 --> 35:08.205
run for hours and never get tired,
scale a building with her bare hands.

35:08.251 --> 35:11.913
And then she died.
People said she went crazy.

35:11.954 --> 35:15.152
- My mother wasn't crazy.
- Of course not.

35:15.225 --> 35:18.194
She was like you. She was doing
all the things you're doing,

35:18.261 --> 35:20.661
pushing herself,
trying too much too fast.

35:20.730 --> 35:24.462
And when she tried something
she wasn't ready for, it killed her.

35:24.502 --> 35:29.337
- Don't want to see that happen to you.
- Kyle, I'm fine.

35:29.373 --> 35:30.864
Jessi.

35:37.682 --> 35:40.811
You can't keep doing this to yourself.

35:40.853 --> 35:42.843
Promise me you'll stop.

35:43.990 --> 35:45.981
I promise.

35:55.936 --> 35:59.531
- You.
- That's right.

35:59.573 --> 36:01.633
The real you or the prickly version?

36:01.676 --> 36:05.203
The ass-whoopin',
kung fu, butt-kickin' version.

36:05.246 --> 36:08.340
- Seriously? You know kung fu?
- No.

36:08.383 --> 36:11.012
But one time, Kyle showed me
how to do a roundhouse.

36:11.053 --> 36:14.922
- Cool. Teach me?
- Sure.

36:16.325 --> 36:18.623
So is this the moment
that we're supposed to

36:18.661 --> 36:22.154
old school Hollywood it
into each other's arms?

36:23.233 --> 36:24.962
Because I'm not running.

36:27.404 --> 36:31.034
- Neither am I.
- Especially not into your arms.

36:31.075 --> 36:33.441
Those things are like chicken legs.

36:33.477 --> 36:36.844
- You love my arms.
- They are cute.

36:42.521 --> 36:44.819
I'm never getting rid of you, am I?

36:44.856 --> 36:48.451
- Nope.
- Good.

36:57.070 --> 37:00.404
- And the cut was gone?
- Completely.

37:00.441 --> 37:02.306
I saw Jessi heal herself.

37:02.343 --> 37:05.801
She might very well
be more advanced than you.

37:05.846 --> 37:08.076
But she's so impulsive.

37:09.217 --> 37:13.017
And that makes you
feel responsible for her.

37:14.623 --> 37:16.614
More than ever.

37:18.227 --> 37:20.889
She needs me to watch out for her.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.391
Like Sarah needed me.

37:28.839 --> 37:31.103
She was falling apart,

37:31.174 --> 37:35.612
and it was all...
just too much for me to handle.

37:37.248 --> 37:38.805
And I left.

37:38.849 --> 37:41.375
That can't be true.

37:41.452 --> 37:45.219
It is true. I failed her.

37:45.257 --> 37:49.216
And I had no right to ask you
to be responsible for Jessi

37:49.261 --> 37:51.855
when I was incapable
of doing that myself.

37:51.930 --> 37:56.663
I thought if you went to the university,
and learned what happened to Sarah...

37:56.735 --> 37:59.637
That I'd make the choice for myself.

38:02.410 --> 38:06.779
You're very brave, Kyle.
And I'm proud of you.

38:14.388 --> 38:16.949
I thought your mom
didn't allow nighttime meetings.

38:16.992 --> 38:20.587
She doesn't. She had a glass of wine
with dinner and passed out on the couch.

38:22.497 --> 38:24.398
Now I know what it feels like
to be Lois Lane.

38:24.467 --> 38:27.958
- Lois who?
- You know, Superman's girlfriend.

38:29.639 --> 38:32.107
She always wanted to be
the center of his universe,

38:32.208 --> 38:35.871
but eventually she realized being
with him meant having to share him.

38:35.912 --> 38:37.311
And did she?

38:39.049 --> 38:40.914
It was hard for her at first.

38:40.984 --> 38:45.318
But then she realized that
it was his destiny to help people.

38:45.356 --> 38:48.758
I just can't help but think, though,

38:48.827 --> 38:50.819
he was so busy protecting other people,

38:50.863 --> 38:53.126
there was never anyone protecting him.

38:53.198 --> 38:56.225
Well, that's why it's not real.

38:56.268 --> 38:58.964
Everyone needs someone
to protect them once in a while.

39:16.124 --> 39:19.218
<i>There's truth in the saying
that time heals all wounds.</i>

39:19.260 --> 39:21.854
<i>Physically,
the healing begins in moments,</i>

39:21.929 --> 39:24.262
<i>and our bodies do all the work.</i>

39:25.333 --> 39:28.599
<i>But when a relationship is injured,</i>

39:28.637 --> 39:30.628
<i>some wounds heal in a day.</i>

39:30.672 --> 39:33.971
<i>Others lay bare
for the rest of our lives.</i>

39:34.042 --> 39:37.535
<i>Sometimes we only
have to heal ourselves.</i>

39:37.580 --> 39:38.774
What was that for?

39:38.815 --> 39:41.284
For persuading me away
from couples therapy.

39:41.318 --> 39:44.617
Personally, I think you'd make a killing
as a marriage counselor.

39:44.655 --> 39:47.522
What about you guys?
Anything eventful happen in your day?

39:47.558 --> 39:51.688
Hilary, Declan, Amanda and I
went to a bar and got into a brawl.

39:51.762 --> 39:53.355
Yeah, right.

39:53.398 --> 39:56.196
Next time, leave Amanda out
if you want to sell your story.

39:56.234 --> 39:58.134
All right.

39:58.203 --> 40:02.072
<i>And, sometimes, our true work
lies in healing others.</i>

40:06.478 --> 40:07.707
Hi, Andy.

40:09.215 --> 40:11.241
Hey, Kyle.

40:11.285 --> 40:13.276
Josh told me about your test tomorrow.

40:13.320 --> 40:16.915
Yeah. Keep your fingers crossed.

40:18.659 --> 40:21.629
- Why?
- It's good luck.

40:21.663 --> 40:23.357
Oh.

40:24.933 --> 40:28.664
- Can't hurt, right?
- Right.

40:30.372 --> 40:33.569
I just want to get it over with.

40:33.609 --> 40:35.543
Waiting is the hardest part.

40:37.246 --> 40:40.147
Andy, everything's gonna be OK.

40:43.420 --> 40:47.084
You know, when you say it,
I almost believe it.

41:20.094 --> 41:24.622
Thanks. You're really a good friend.
