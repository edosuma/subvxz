WEBVTT

00:01.369 --> 00:03.637
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:03.671 --> 00:07.141
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:07.175 --> 00:08.709
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:08.742 --> 00:11.712
but at a terrible cost.

00:11.745 --> 00:14.648
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.682 --> 00:17.085
a secretive group called
the Shepherds released a gas

00:17.118 --> 00:18.819
that sterilized all of humanity.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.654
And then,
lab-made creatures called "hybrids"

00:20.688 --> 00:24.225
devastated the West Coast,

00:24.258 --> 00:26.294
so a massive barrier
was constructed

00:26.327 --> 00:29.563
to protect the rest
of North America.

00:29.597 --> 00:32.566
But new breeds have
started to appear,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.268
so we reassembled our team.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.669
We battle on many fronts,

00:35.703 --> 00:37.238
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:37.271 --> 00:40.408
while racing to stop the hybrids

00:40.441 --> 00:42.576
and the rogue Shepherd
who created them

00:42.610 --> 00:45.813
to end the human race.

00:45.846 --> 00:48.282
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:51.152 --> 00:53.587
Previously on Zoo...

00:53.621 --> 00:56.490
We're on the wrong side of the barrier.
In the hybrid zone.

00:56.524 --> 00:59.293
LOGAN: Guys, listen,
whatever you're gonna do, do it fast.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.770
We have less than two hours
before Garrison orders

01:00.794 --> 01:03.797
missile strikes to take out
the beacons and the nests.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.309
JACKSON: We have to get
the dead man's switch

01:05.333 --> 01:06.367
to the command center.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.736
Still a whole lot of
hybrids between us and it.

01:08.769 --> 01:09.879
Then we build the
pheromone diffuser.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.839
SAM: Lure the hybrids
away, clearing a path

01:11.872 --> 01:13.450
from here to the barrier
for everybody else.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.343
ABRAHAM: All we have to do

01:15.376 --> 01:16.653
is get that child to the barrier

01:16.677 --> 01:18.646
and we can end sterility.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.814
JACKSON: I had a family once...
A wife and a son.

01:20.848 --> 01:22.850
Clem and the baby are gonna be fine.
I know.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.718
I'm sorry, Jackson.

01:24.752 --> 01:26.520
ABIGAIL: Your world
is burning down.

01:26.554 --> 01:27.554
I've won.

01:28.589 --> 01:29.757
(yells)

01:29.790 --> 01:32.526
That boy you just sent
tumbling over the cliff,

01:32.560 --> 01:35.529
his name isn't Sam.

01:35.563 --> 01:36.897
It's Connor.

01:36.930 --> 01:37.930
Your son.

01:47.708 --> 01:50.211
The dead man's switch should be
able to turn off the beacons.

01:50.244 --> 01:53.347
Let's hope the world lasts
long enough to find out.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.749
Status report.
Lima's not responding.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.894
We're losing ground in Hong
Kong; troops falling back.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.653
Berlin is suffering
civilian casualties;

01:59.687 --> 02:00.721
requesting backup.

02:00.754 --> 02:02.290
How many beacons are active?

02:02.323 --> 02:03.657
12. Only one is still dark.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.826
The U.S. beacon in St. Louis.

02:05.859 --> 02:08.696
Are there any nests on
the east side of the wall?

02:08.729 --> 02:10.163
No. We've eliminated them.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.699
There are plenty of
hybrids out there,

02:11.732 --> 02:12.842
and every single one of them

02:12.866 --> 02:14.202
will be charging the barrier

02:14.235 --> 02:15.612
if the beacon in St.
Louis turns on.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.371
LOGAN: North America's
safe for now,

02:17.405 --> 02:19.349
but none of that will matter if
we exceed the nest threshold.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.741
That's game over for everyone.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.810
You and that piece
of mad science

02:22.843 --> 02:24.545
are our last hope.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.514
Great. No pressure.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.284
(device beeping)

02:45.566 --> 02:47.401
Garrison said I'd find you here.

02:47.435 --> 02:49.570
They wouldn't let me go
back out to look for him.

02:49.603 --> 02:50.771
You all patched up?

02:50.804 --> 02:53.741
They have very
good doctors here.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.644
Even better meds.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.312
Any sign of Jackson and Sam?

02:58.346 --> 03:01.315
No, not yet. No hybrids, either.

03:01.349 --> 03:03.593
They must have drawn them away
with Sam's pheromone diffuser.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.353
You try calling them?

03:05.386 --> 03:07.655
No answer.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.657
Their phones must
still be affected

03:09.690 --> 03:11.559
by the EMP.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.627
I'm sure the effects
will wear off soon.

03:13.661 --> 03:14.895
I'll keep trying.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.515
Sir, I'm trying to input new
data, but the operating system

03:25.539 --> 03:27.484
isn't responding. Same.
There's no clear shut-down path.

03:27.508 --> 03:29.843
I thought you knew how to
work this dead man's switch,

03:29.877 --> 03:32.346
or whatever you're calling it.
It turned the beacons on...

03:32.380 --> 03:34.715
It should be able to
turn them back off again.

03:34.748 --> 03:37.318
I am seeing a way
to cut the power.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.928
DARIELA: No, you can't do that...
When we cut the power

03:38.952 --> 03:40.688
in Tokyo,
it triggered a massive explosion.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.423
Copy that.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.726
Can't cut the power, maybe I can...
divert it.

03:45.759 --> 03:46.960
To where?

03:46.994 --> 03:48.662
KNOX: Sir, we're 30 minutes away

03:48.696 --> 03:50.564
from nest threshold.
Get the generals.

03:50.598 --> 03:53.000
It's time to discuss
the contingency plan.

03:53.033 --> 03:55.536
What exactly is this
contingency plan?

03:55.569 --> 03:56.846
DARIELA: A multinational
coalition

03:56.870 --> 03:58.572
of naval warships
are standing by

03:58.606 --> 04:00.308
to eliminate the
beacons and nests.

04:00.341 --> 04:02.843
We can't fire long-range
missiles at those things.

04:02.876 --> 04:04.512
The loss of life
will be astronomical.

04:04.545 --> 04:05.979
KNOX: Generals are on the line.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.381
Thank you. You can't do this.

04:37.578 --> 04:39.847
What did you do?

04:39.880 --> 04:40.914
Where's Isaac?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.816
What? Where is he?

04:42.850 --> 04:44.485
At a friend's house in Indiana.
Why?

04:44.518 --> 04:47.020
Call him. Tell him to get on the
road, head north,

04:47.054 --> 04:48.689
don't stop until
the roads run out.

04:48.722 --> 04:50.724
Mitch?
What are you talking about?

04:50.758 --> 04:53.093
JURGENS: The Australia
beacon just went dark.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.995
It's spooling down.

04:55.028 --> 04:57.365
BELL: Hong Kong is down.

04:57.398 --> 04:59.533
There goes Russia.

04:59.567 --> 05:00.801
Kenya, too.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.403
They're all shutting off.

05:02.436 --> 05:03.671
Where did he go?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.439
I don't know.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.475
Columbia is down!

05:22.155 --> 05:23.524
St. Louis is live!

05:23.557 --> 05:24.592
(applause stops)

05:26.594 --> 05:28.529
St. Louis is live.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.870
(quietly): Oh, Mitch,
what did you do?

05:42.009 --> 05:43.711
My God.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.420
(horn honking)

05:54.087 --> 05:55.389
Hey! Over there!

05:57.691 --> 06:00.060
(horn honking)

06:04.798 --> 06:05.999
He's got Sam.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.635
We need to open the gate.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.540
Hang on, Sam!

06:12.573 --> 06:14.107
We're almost there!

06:18.879 --> 06:21.114
(hybrids snarling)

06:27.120 --> 06:28.956
(engine revs)

06:30.958 --> 06:32.960
(hybrids barking, roaring)

06:36.497 --> 06:38.031
(softly): Yeah.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.734
Look at that face.

06:40.768 --> 06:44.772
Your grandma, she always used
to wash my hands and my face.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.106
I hated it.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.941
But I grew up sick.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.077
She thought about
germs as the enemy.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.479
(baby coos)

06:51.512 --> 06:53.614
Wish you could have met her.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.148
Sir, we are under orders...

06:55.182 --> 06:56.626
Good for you.
I got to see my daughter.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.486
Dad? That's my daughter.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.687
Let him through.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.822
We got to go.

07:01.855 --> 07:02.999
What? Where? Anywhere but here.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.492
No, I'm not going anywhere

07:04.525 --> 07:06.202
till you tell me what
the hell is going on.

07:06.226 --> 07:08.128
The hybrids are coming...
Like, all of them.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.897
What did you do?!

07:11.231 --> 07:12.633
The St. Louis beacon is live,

07:12.666 --> 07:14.034
and drawing more
power as we speak.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.770
Couldn't turn 'em off;
couldn't cut the power.

07:16.804 --> 07:19.239
You redirected it here?

07:19.272 --> 07:21.709
The energy's got to go someplace.
I should throw you

07:21.742 --> 07:23.544
in the brig.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.821
We have the barrier, okay?
We're better off

07:24.845 --> 07:25.813
than anybody is.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.615
We can handle the fallout.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.225
(tires screech)

07:38.258 --> 07:40.093
I need some help here!

07:42.730 --> 07:43.864
Why...

07:43.897 --> 07:45.999
why did you save me?

07:48.001 --> 07:49.970
You're gonna be fine, okay?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.238
One, two,

07:51.271 --> 07:52.540
three.

07:52.573 --> 07:53.841
(grunts)

07:53.874 --> 07:55.475
What happened out there?

07:58.011 --> 07:59.847
JACKSON: You're gonna be fine.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.248
Stay still.

08:01.281 --> 08:02.521
I'm just glad you're all right.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.587
(crashing)

08:06.620 --> 08:07.921
(hybrid roaring)

08:07.955 --> 08:09.823
(snarling, pounding)

08:09.857 --> 08:11.692
Where did all those
hybrids come from?

08:11.725 --> 08:13.994
Mitch was able to shut
down the beacons worldwide.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.696
But only by diverting

08:15.729 --> 08:17.931
the power to the one
here in North America.

08:17.965 --> 08:18.866
TESSA: Which means every hybrid

08:18.899 --> 08:20.901
west of the barrier is
headed right for us.

08:20.934 --> 08:22.770
(crashing)

08:22.803 --> 08:26.840
(hybrid roaring)

08:26.874 --> 08:28.241
Well, then...

08:28.275 --> 08:31.111
(roaring continues)

08:31.144 --> 08:33.981
let's just pray
the barrier holds.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.149
(hybrids barking, snarling)

08:38.018 --> 08:39.219
(automatic gunfire)

09:06.379 --> 09:09.182
♪

09:21.895 --> 09:24.031
MAN (over P.A.): All
military personnel

09:24.064 --> 09:25.999
report immediately to
your commanding officer

09:26.033 --> 09:27.635
for deployment orders.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.238
MITCH: Listen,
we don't have a lot of time.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.607
Clem, I just want to get you
and the baby out of here.

09:33.641 --> 09:35.208
Let's go.
No, I'm not going anywhere

09:35.242 --> 09:36.877
without Sam.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.387
LOGAN: And that wall
is solid concrete.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.715
15 feet thick and 40 feet high.
We're taking a hit,

09:41.749 --> 09:44.718
but this is still the safest
place for her right now.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.888
The blood of all these soldiers
is on your hands, Dr. Morgan.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.389
Did you even stop to think about

09:49.422 --> 09:51.134
what would happen if you
activated that beacon?

09:51.158 --> 09:52.702
What I did saved millions of
lives all over the world, okay?

09:52.726 --> 09:54.237
Well, what's your plan now, Mitch?
Stop.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.872
Want to know what his plan was?
We have no idea how to

09:55.896 --> 09:56.940
shut this thing down.
Bomb a bunch of cities back...

09:56.964 --> 09:58.365
Stop!

09:58.398 --> 10:01.134
I'm not going anywhere.

10:01.168 --> 10:04.237
I'm staying right here with
Sam, till he's stable.

10:04.271 --> 10:06.239
So you can stop
worrying about me,

10:06.273 --> 10:08.008
and start worrying
about the beacon.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.647
I just needed to buy some time.

10:13.681 --> 10:14.948
Time for what?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.292
To figure out how the
beacon is designed.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.251
Okay?
If you can get me all the intel

10:18.285 --> 10:21.121
that you have on it,
I might be able to reverse-engineer it.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.266
We'll start pulling body cam
footage from our team in Tokyo.

10:23.290 --> 10:24.934
Although none of that's
gonna matter unless I know

10:24.958 --> 10:27.127
exactly what the beacons
are broadcasting and I...

10:27.160 --> 10:28.996
There's a signal-
monitoring station

10:29.029 --> 10:30.931
in the wall a half click north.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.076
I'll take a team and redirect
it to target the beacon.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.377
GARRISON: If you can't
take that beacon offline,

10:34.401 --> 10:35.936
I'll have to take
it out by force.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.038
No, no, no. You can't do that.

10:38.071 --> 10:40.316
We've already got St.
Louis and half of Missouri evacuated.

10:40.340 --> 10:41.675
None of those
people will be able

10:41.709 --> 10:43.711
to get out of the
blast radius in time.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.979
My hands are tied.
This is by executive order.

10:46.013 --> 10:48.682
If there is another
way, find it.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.173
Hey, what are you doing?

11:13.206 --> 11:15.275
Looking for weaknesses.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.846
The inverter's triple-shielded.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.248
Transmitter is inaccessible.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.984
I couldn't have designed
the perfect system,

11:24.017 --> 11:27.755
because perfect systems don't exist.
Yeah,

11:27.788 --> 11:31.792
and you didn't design the
beacons, Duncan did.

11:31.825 --> 11:35.362
Using my brain, so,
what's the difference?

11:35.395 --> 11:38.198
But, if anybody's

11:38.231 --> 11:41.368
gonna stop this thing,
it's gonna be the guy who made it.

11:41.401 --> 11:44.371
Well, okay.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.207
Then...

11:47.240 --> 11:50.177
I'm going to stay here with you,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.412
Mitch Morgan,

11:52.445 --> 11:55.749
and we're gonna figure it out.

12:02.422 --> 12:06.026
ABRAHAM: This serum will help
boost your child's ability

12:06.059 --> 12:08.495
to create the CLM protein

12:08.528 --> 12:12.465
and restore human reproduction.

12:12.499 --> 12:16.203
Don't worry,
it's quite harmless.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.538
Just three shots.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.808
One now,

12:20.841 --> 12:24.011
one in 12 hours,

12:24.044 --> 12:27.014
and the last in 24.

12:27.047 --> 12:30.017
Okay, you ready, little peanut?

12:31.919 --> 12:34.521
If he's really going
to save the world,

12:34.554 --> 12:37.524
people are going to want
to call him something.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.860
Have you picked a name for
him, yet?

12:39.893 --> 12:44.031
I have a few ideas.
Mostly family names.

12:44.064 --> 12:46.934
(baby crying)

12:46.967 --> 12:49.569
I know, I know,
I know, little one.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.939
It's a great responsibility.

12:51.972 --> 12:53.506
(baby crying)

12:53.540 --> 12:55.508
Sam and I never
decided on a name.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.217
Now, maybe we never will.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.122
It's okay.

13:09.156 --> 13:11.091
(baby cooing)

13:13.326 --> 13:15.262
(monitor beeping)

13:31.879 --> 13:33.380
Jackson.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.886
What you did took
bravery and compassion.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.054
You knew Sam was
working with Abigail,

13:41.088 --> 13:42.688
and yet you risked
your life to save him.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.585
I'm not sure I would
have done the same.

13:48.962 --> 13:52.465
Trust me, Abe,
you would have done the same.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.834
You saved his life, Jackson.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.073
You gave a son his father.

14:02.642 --> 14:04.311
I didn't do it for the baby.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.315
I did it for me.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.850
What do you mean?

14:16.556 --> 14:19.359
Sam...

14:19.392 --> 14:21.528
Sam is Connor Oz.

14:30.137 --> 14:32.272
Sam is my son.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.448
This was all part
of Abigail's plan...

14:41.481 --> 14:44.251
For us to meet like this.

14:44.284 --> 14:48.288
She wanted revenge for taking
our father away from her.

14:48.321 --> 14:53.426
She wanted me to watch
Connor die all over again.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.628
But if Abigail is
the one that told you

14:55.662 --> 14:58.398
Sam is Connor,
why would you believe her?

14:58.431 --> 15:01.534
Because she had proof.

15:01.568 --> 15:03.270
Because she had this.

15:05.738 --> 15:08.641
Nia knit this for Connor.

15:08.675 --> 15:12.045
He was wrapped in this.

15:21.354 --> 15:23.456
My God.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.394
20 years ago...

15:29.462 --> 15:31.965
I watched my son die.

15:35.302 --> 15:36.303
And now he's here.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.677
Older than I was
the day he was born.

15:46.746 --> 15:48.681
He's a grown man.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.522
How do I make this right?

16:14.674 --> 16:17.210
Are the beacons still down?

16:17.244 --> 16:19.212
Whatever Mitch did,
it's still working.

16:19.246 --> 16:20.647
Status report.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.649
Coalition forces have
secured population centers

16:22.682 --> 16:24.084
in Istanbul and Hong Kong.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.718
Civilian casualties declining.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.487
The German Air Force
is exterminating

16:27.520 --> 16:29.189
the hybrids outside Berlin.

16:29.222 --> 16:30.566
Dr. Morgan's still
working on a solution

16:30.590 --> 16:31.991
for the St. Louis beacon.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.174
Tell me you have good news.

16:48.508 --> 16:51.744
Nope. Nothing yet.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.313
Any new beacon activity?

16:53.346 --> 16:54.814
No.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.250
So... we're winning?

16:57.284 --> 16:59.686
Not we, Dr. Morgan.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.588
We are still under
siege and outnumbered

17:01.621 --> 17:03.556
a thousand to one.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.157
TROY: Sir?

17:05.192 --> 17:07.327
The monitoring station's
been compromised.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.061
It was overrun by razorbacks.

17:09.096 --> 17:12.132
We were barely able to
reposition the antenna array

17:12.165 --> 17:14.834
and secure the signal data from the St.
Louis beacon.

17:14.867 --> 17:18.371
Get yourself to the infirmary.

17:18.405 --> 17:20.772
I'd be headed to the morgue
if it wasn't for Wilson here.

17:20.807 --> 17:23.742
Hey, let's get you patched up.

17:25.578 --> 17:26.779
Come on, Wilson, let's go.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.381
(Wilson barks) Good boy.

17:28.415 --> 17:31.084
This better be worth it.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.664
How long do you think your
men can hold the barrier?

17:35.688 --> 17:40.160
Are you having doubts about your fix?
Because...

17:40.193 --> 17:41.470
How long do you think
they can hold it?

17:41.494 --> 17:43.763
Do you even know?

17:50.237 --> 17:53.473
Okay,
I need you to get my daughter

17:53.506 --> 17:54.707
and her baby out of here.

17:54.741 --> 17:59.279
Look, right now they're the most
important people in the world.

17:59.312 --> 18:02.182
Keeping them here,
that is not a risk I'm willing to take.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.417
The rest of your team agrees?

18:04.451 --> 18:05.752
This is bigger than the team.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.320
It's bigger than all of us.

18:07.354 --> 18:10.557
I'll have Echo Team
move your daughter

18:10.590 --> 18:12.159
and her baby further east.

18:12.192 --> 18:15.862
The rest is on you.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.446
Sector H has been compromised.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.690
Hybrids threatening to
breach near the generators.

18:34.714 --> 18:37.884
Sustaining heavy losses in Sectors
E, F, and N.

18:37.917 --> 18:40.187
(rumbling)

18:42.222 --> 18:43.690
Got reports of fire in Sector C.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.258
Seal it off.

18:45.292 --> 18:46.859
We've still got people in there.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.595
Everyone with a
heartbeat is out.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.264
We're stretched too thin.
We need to start prioritizing.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.799
Keep the power
generators protected.

18:52.832 --> 18:54.867
We lose power, we're done.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.937
Marshall all remaining troops
around central command.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.906
Move Delta to the generator.

18:59.939 --> 19:04.444
And order the immediate
evacuation of all noncombatants.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.782
Evacuation...

19:09.816 --> 19:11.150
Give the order.

19:12.852 --> 19:13.953
We can't win this fight.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.888
All we can do is hold the line,

19:15.922 --> 19:18.725
pray we can find a way
to shut down that beacon

19:18.758 --> 19:21.261
before those monsters
find a way through.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.667
WOMAN (over P.A.): All
infirmary personnel,

19:27.700 --> 19:30.570
please relocate patients
to the southwest corridor.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.340
All infirmary personnel,

19:33.373 --> 19:35.742
please relocate patients
to the southwest corridor.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.450
Clementine, we need to...

19:52.692 --> 19:55.528
Hang on a second.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.082
There's two different
frequencies here.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.501
Is that the signal from the St.
Louis beacon?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.303
Can you isolate them?

20:06.739 --> 20:09.008
Wait, hold up. I recognize that.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.612
That's the frequency that
Abigail recorded off me.

20:12.645 --> 20:15.815
She said that that's how
I control the animals.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.321
Beacons are designed
to draw hybrids.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.256
Why would she include your frequency?
No idea.

20:23.290 --> 20:25.258
I mean,
it's not attracting any animals.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.894
If that's mine,

20:27.927 --> 20:29.562
I bet you that this one

20:29.596 --> 20:31.030
came from Abigail.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.000
Right. It's how she
commands the hybrids.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.868
Yeah. My guess is,

20:35.902 --> 20:36.969
with those two frequencies

20:37.003 --> 20:39.806
amplified by the beacon,
it creates a sonic barrier.

20:39.839 --> 20:42.275
Like the one in Tokyo. Yeah.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.776
And if that really
is your frequency,

20:43.810 --> 20:44.777
you might be the only one

20:44.811 --> 20:45.912
who's able to get past

20:45.945 --> 20:47.647
the beacon's defenses.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.680
How's that?

20:51.584 --> 20:53.620
Because I figured out how
I, uh...

20:53.653 --> 20:56.022
or, how Duncan
designed the beacon.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.759
And I found a flaw.

20:59.792 --> 21:00.960
It's all set up

21:00.993 --> 21:03.330
to keep people away.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.732
Think of it like two
identical tuning forks

21:05.765 --> 21:08.335
resonating at the
same frequency.

21:08.368 --> 21:12.004
You and the beacon are in sync,

21:12.038 --> 21:13.798
but everyone else on
the planet is dissonant.

21:15.708 --> 21:20.380
So you're saying that I won't
be affected by the signal.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.715
It's a guess.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.051
But seeing what happened
to those soldiers in Tokyo,

21:25.084 --> 21:28.588
I think getting close to it
is still gonna hurt like hell.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.557
JAMIE: Wait,
but even if you're right,

21:30.590 --> 21:32.659
how does getting close
to the beacon help us?

21:32.692 --> 21:34.561
Well,
I can make a device that we can

21:34.594 --> 21:36.996
attach directly to the beacons,
it'll give us remote access.

21:37.029 --> 21:38.398
And if you can do that,

21:38.431 --> 21:39.751
maybe we can turn
it off for good.

21:42.034 --> 21:44.437
You make the package.

21:44.471 --> 21:45.751
I'll make sure it
gets delivered.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.408
Are you sure you
want to do that?

21:48.441 --> 21:50.042
Absolutely.

21:50.076 --> 21:51.378
'Cause if this doesn't work...

21:52.945 --> 21:55.415
One problem at a time.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.452
Mitch! How dare you.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.854
Clem's baby is critical
for the sterilization cure,

22:01.888 --> 22:03.756
and you sent him away
without consulting us?

22:03.790 --> 22:05.825
You did what?

22:05.858 --> 22:06.959
JAMIE: Okay, slow down.

22:06.993 --> 22:08.127
Clem and the baby needed

22:08.160 --> 22:09.762
to be someplace safe.

22:09.796 --> 22:10.876
What? You knew about this?!

22:11.731 --> 22:13.032
I did us all a favor.

22:14.867 --> 22:16.545
If you were so sure you
were doing what was right,

22:16.569 --> 22:18.137
why did you hide it from us?!

22:18.170 --> 22:20.707
I should have been there
to administer the serum.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.610
If he misses his next
dose, the cure is lost!

22:23.643 --> 22:25.812
My family, my call.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.380
JACKSON: No, Mitch,

22:27.414 --> 22:28.681
that's not how this team works.

22:28.715 --> 22:29.825
Well, that's how I
work, Jackson.

22:29.849 --> 22:30.859
You're not the only one that has

22:30.883 --> 22:31.951
a personal stake in this!

22:31.984 --> 22:32.985
All right?

22:35.154 --> 22:37.123
Make the device!

22:37.156 --> 22:39.659
You better hope that Clem
and her baby are fine.

22:41.528 --> 22:43.663
Okay, what was that about?

22:45.998 --> 22:50.803
Sam's real name is Connor Oz.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.806
He's Jackson's son.

23:04.851 --> 23:06.553
This way, sir.

23:08.821 --> 23:10.723
Central command thinks
you've found a way

23:10.757 --> 23:11.891
to take this thing down.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.893
Yeah, well,
we got an idea at least.

23:13.926 --> 23:15.828
If we can attach this
device to the beacon,

23:15.862 --> 23:17.530
we got a guy back at the barrier

23:17.564 --> 23:18.907
who might be able to
shut this thing down

23:18.931 --> 23:20.567
without blowing us
all to kingdom come.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.068
It may even send a mirror pulse,

23:22.101 --> 23:24.637
which would knock the hybrids
away from the barrier.

23:24.671 --> 23:25.681
The sonic waves that
thing's spitting out

23:25.705 --> 23:26.806
dropped six of my men.

23:26.839 --> 23:28.174
Medic said it was like

23:28.207 --> 23:29.942
their organs were
being shaken apart.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.479
This is our stop.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.881
(beacon pulsing rhythmically)

23:34.914 --> 23:36.883
It's massive.

23:40.820 --> 23:42.855
How did no one notice
this thing before?

23:42.889 --> 23:45.525
Permits say they were building
an advanced radio tower to aid

23:45.558 --> 23:46.802
with communication
beyond the barrier.

23:46.826 --> 23:47.994
Well...

23:48.027 --> 23:49.929
that's at least half true.

23:49.962 --> 23:52.031
All right.

23:52.064 --> 23:55.134
No use in standing around and
just staring at this thing.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.803
I'm coming with you.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.539
Tessa, no.

23:59.572 --> 24:00.940
Mm-hmm. You heard him.

24:00.973 --> 24:02.017
You can't get close
to that thing.

24:02.041 --> 24:03.743
Then I'll go as far as I can.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.045
Look, I know

24:06.078 --> 24:08.848
you saved my ass more
times than I can remember.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.550
But this,

24:10.583 --> 24:13.486
this I have to do alone.

24:17.890 --> 24:19.626
I love you.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.107
Come on, baby.

24:35.141 --> 24:37.009
(sonic waves humming)

24:37.043 --> 24:39.011
(groans)

24:39.045 --> 24:40.212
Jackson! No!

24:40.246 --> 24:41.914
TESSA: Jackson!

24:41.948 --> 24:43.249
(gasps)

24:49.622 --> 24:51.090
Go back. No!

24:51.123 --> 24:52.925
Go back! I won't leave you!

24:52.959 --> 24:55.094
Please... go back!

24:58.765 --> 25:01.734
(groans) Go.

25:05.705 --> 25:08.307
You okay? Are you okay?

25:08.340 --> 25:09.676
Mm-hmm. I'm fine. Okay.

25:09.709 --> 25:10.709
I'm fine.

25:26.225 --> 25:27.760
He's made it
further than anyone.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.729
Including SEALs in
full pressurized gear.

25:29.762 --> 25:31.197
He just needs to
get close enough

25:31.230 --> 25:33.332
to connect that power inverter.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.168
(power whirring) What's that?

25:39.238 --> 25:40.573
Delta, report.

25:40.607 --> 25:41.908
(automatic gunfire)

25:41.941 --> 25:43.643
MAJOR: We got
razors in Section H.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.887
They've broken through the line.

25:44.911 --> 25:45.812
We have to fall back.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.079
Major, do not retreat.

25:47.113 --> 25:48.223
We have to hold the generator.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.049
(gunfire continues, man yells)

25:50.082 --> 25:53.886
(razorback roars, man screams)

25:53.920 --> 25:55.888
Major!

25:55.922 --> 25:57.256
Command, we're low on ammo.

25:57.289 --> 26:00.793
And men.
There's too many of them!

26:00.827 --> 26:02.729
If we lose power,
it won't matter

26:02.762 --> 26:04.697
if Jackson makes
it to that beacon.

26:04.731 --> 26:06.599
Delta Team needs reinforcements.

26:06.633 --> 26:08.234
We're all that's left.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.703
I want every able body

26:10.737 --> 26:13.105
to come with me.
Let's defend that generator!

26:13.139 --> 26:14.139
Move, people, now!

26:15.808 --> 26:17.977
We'll keep up the power
as long as we can.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.246
Jackson is going to make it.

26:29.021 --> 26:31.190
(beacon pulsing rhythmically)

26:36.395 --> 26:38.665
The last time I left you
alone in a hybrid attack,

26:38.698 --> 26:40.166
I didn't see you for ten years.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.367
Not happening again.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.373
Jackson, talk to me.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.044
Want to...

26:52.078 --> 26:54.681
trade places?

26:54.714 --> 26:56.916
Look, you got to hurry.

26:56.949 --> 26:57.993
Our generator's under attack.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.819
If we lose power,

26:59.852 --> 27:01.897
I won't be able to send commands
to shut down the beacon.

27:01.921 --> 27:04.056
Copy that!

27:04.090 --> 27:05.858
(straining)

27:05.892 --> 27:08.761
Okay. Yes.

27:13.365 --> 27:14.943
ABRAHAM: They need
help at Generator Four.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.268
The razorbacks must have

27:16.302 --> 27:17.312
breached the southwest
access tunnel.

27:17.336 --> 27:19.171
DARIELA: If we flank them,

27:19.205 --> 27:21.149
we might be able stop them
from getting any further.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.374
You guys go.

27:22.408 --> 27:24.310
We'll head for the sub-station.
Come on, Wilson.

27:24.343 --> 27:28.147
(distant gunfire, roaring)

27:30.917 --> 27:33.820
(Wilson barks)

27:33.853 --> 27:36.455
(distant gunfire)

27:36.488 --> 27:38.324
(roars)

27:38.357 --> 27:40.126
(yelling)

27:41.427 --> 27:42.695
Wilson!

27:45.464 --> 27:47.700
(Wilson whimpers) No!

27:49.802 --> 27:50.903
(yells)

27:56.976 --> 27:58.010
(snarls)

27:58.044 --> 28:00.212
(yells)

28:07.887 --> 28:09.956
Soft underbelly.

28:09.989 --> 28:10.989
Just like you.

28:12.759 --> 28:13.993
(grunts)

28:26.939 --> 28:28.407
LOGAN: After this,

28:28.440 --> 28:30.509
it's just a half
hour to Fort Brennan.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.045
Where did you find a baby seat?

28:33.079 --> 28:35.381
When I heard you were
inbound with a newborn,

28:35.414 --> 28:37.349
first thing I did was get
a logistics team on it.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.051
It's no easy thing
finding baby gear

28:39.085 --> 28:41.120
when there haven't been
babies in a decade.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.289
CLEMENTINE: You've
always looked out for me.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.925
Since back when I was
living with you and Jamie.

28:47.293 --> 28:49.261
Thank you.

28:50.997 --> 28:53.065
Now there's two of
you to look after.

28:56.368 --> 28:57.904
You got a name for
this little guy yet

28:57.937 --> 28:59.939
or are we just gonna keep
calling him Barrier Baby?

29:01.307 --> 29:02.484
(laughs) That's what
they're calling him?

29:02.508 --> 29:03.943
Yeah.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.145
You need to come up
with something better

29:06.178 --> 29:07.178
before it sticks.

29:08.815 --> 29:10.817
Samuel.

29:10.850 --> 29:13.519
Maybe Sam for short.

29:13.552 --> 29:16.222
I'm sure Sam will like
hearing that when he wakes up.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.958
If he wakes up.

29:18.991 --> 29:21.560
Clem, he will.

29:21.593 --> 29:22.761
He's gonna be fine.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.173
You said Sam would
be right behind us.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.008
I don't see an ambulance.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.880
Logan, where is Sam?

29:40.913 --> 29:43.382
He's not here.

29:43.415 --> 29:44.860
Turn around.
He's not well enough to be moved.

29:44.884 --> 29:45.852
I said...

29:45.885 --> 29:48.988
(hybrid screeches) Hang on!

29:49.021 --> 29:51.457
(hybrids screeching)

29:51.490 --> 29:54.360
Whatever happens,
don't leave the vehicle!

29:56.595 --> 29:58.464
(crying)

30:06.272 --> 30:07.339
Logan!

30:12.078 --> 30:13.512
(baby crying)

30:19.585 --> 30:22.889
(engine cranking)

30:22.922 --> 30:24.223
Come on!

30:26.225 --> 30:27.326
(baby crying)

30:34.266 --> 30:36.903
(roaring)

30:43.342 --> 30:44.342
I'm out.

30:48.680 --> 30:51.083
Dariela, I don't know if...

30:51.117 --> 30:53.319
Don't.
We're gonna see Isaac again.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.121
And he's gonna have
lots of grandbabies

30:55.154 --> 30:57.123
for us to spoil rotten.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.433
Because of the cure
his daddy made.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.560
So don't you give up on me, Abe.

31:01.593 --> 31:02.929
You hear me?

31:02.962 --> 31:03.963
(Abraham yells)

31:05.697 --> 31:08.034
(yelling)

31:16.442 --> 31:18.477
(sonic waves humming)

31:20.579 --> 31:22.982
Come on, Jackson, hurry.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.884
(yelling)

31:29.255 --> 31:31.490
(Jackson yelling)

31:31.523 --> 31:33.592
(grunts)

31:49.575 --> 31:52.511
(grunting, yelling)

31:54.246 --> 31:55.547
(Jackson yells)

31:59.718 --> 32:02.088
(grunts)

32:02.121 --> 32:03.422
Package delivered.

32:05.691 --> 32:06.691
JAMIE: Jackson?

32:08.727 --> 32:10.096
Jackson.

32:13.065 --> 32:14.433
He's not moving.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.204
No. Let me go...

32:18.237 --> 32:19.405
No, you can't.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.476
(beeping)

32:24.510 --> 32:26.278
He did it.

32:26.312 --> 32:28.447
We're online.

32:28.480 --> 32:31.150
Reconfiguring power source.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.319
Sending the command...

32:33.352 --> 32:34.720
now.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.058
Do you think it's working?

32:39.091 --> 32:40.292
(exhales)

32:40.326 --> 32:41.460
I don't know.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.030
Jackson! No!

32:46.032 --> 32:47.399
(growling, snarling)

32:53.039 --> 32:54.973
(snarling)

32:57.509 --> 32:59.445
(power whirring)

33:02.514 --> 33:04.516
(snarling)

33:10.056 --> 33:12.458
The hybrids are retreating.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.493
They must've shut
down the beacon.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.128
We got the advantage, people.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.497
Let's use it!

33:23.702 --> 33:25.404
We did it. (chuckles)

33:26.605 --> 33:28.074
Jackson!

33:28.107 --> 33:30.109
We did it.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.078
He did it.

33:37.383 --> 33:38.617
(sniffles)

33:38.650 --> 33:40.219
You did it.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.653
Baby, you did it.

33:41.687 --> 33:44.656
No. Open your eyes.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.492
Come back to me.

33:46.525 --> 33:48.160
You did it. Baby...

33:48.194 --> 33:49.361
Baby, you did it.

33:49.395 --> 33:53.765
Just... open your eyes.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.167
Say something.

33:55.201 --> 33:57.803
Come back to me.

33:57.836 --> 34:00.139
Please.

34:03.842 --> 34:08.647
Let's get this penguin
back to the igloo.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.683
(laughs)

34:41.179 --> 34:42.714
♪

34:47.786 --> 34:50.121
(whispering): Hey.

34:50.156 --> 34:52.424
We did it, buddy.

34:52.458 --> 34:55.226
We knocked those
hybrid sons of bitches

34:55.261 --> 34:57.196
on their asses.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.435
We saved the damn world.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.642
I couldn't have done it without
you, soldier.

35:13.279 --> 35:14.680
Good boy.

35:26.325 --> 35:27.859
(sniffles)

35:33.899 --> 35:37.336
(snarling)

35:39.438 --> 35:41.207
(Troy screams)

35:51.917 --> 35:53.219
(engine turns off)

35:56.422 --> 35:57.823
Cut it kind of close out there.

35:57.856 --> 35:59.891
Little suspense never hurt
anyone, right?

35:59.925 --> 36:01.327
(chuckles)

36:01.360 --> 36:03.262
Oh, yeah, you did it.

36:03.295 --> 36:04.295
We did it.

36:05.331 --> 36:06.832
How's Sam?

36:06.865 --> 36:08.667
He's safe.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.981
They were able to protect the
infirmary during the attack.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.316
And with the beacon down,
we're pushing back the hybrids.

36:14.340 --> 36:15.641
Once we secure the perimeter,

36:15.674 --> 36:17.243
Garrison's gonna
recall Echo Team,

36:17.276 --> 36:18.720
and we're gonna bring
back Clem and the baby.

36:18.744 --> 36:19.945
And it's not only here.

36:19.978 --> 36:21.680
The IADG and local militia

36:21.713 --> 36:23.249
have hybrids
contained worldwide.

36:23.282 --> 36:24.959
They're eliminating
stragglers as we speak.

36:24.983 --> 36:26.752
So we took down the beacon,

36:26.785 --> 36:29.688
stopped a hybrid army and
the cure for human sterility

36:29.721 --> 36:31.323
is just on the horizon.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.891
Anybody else need a drink?

36:32.924 --> 36:34.293
KNOX: Hey!

36:34.326 --> 36:36.495
Dr. Morgan.

36:36.528 --> 36:38.540
Garrison needs you all back
in the command center now.

36:38.564 --> 36:39.698
Why, what happened?

36:39.731 --> 36:41.333
It's Troy's dog.

36:41.367 --> 36:42.701
They just found Troy

36:42.734 --> 36:44.270
torn to pieces in an exam room.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.505
Soldiers had to corner
the dog and put him down.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.673
But he was already dead.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.341
Yeah, well, it came back.

36:49.375 --> 36:50.542
As a hybrid.

36:50.576 --> 36:52.278
What? That's...

36:52.311 --> 36:53.845
not possible.
Whatever the thing is,

36:53.879 --> 36:55.514
you need to have a look at
it, ASAP.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.851
So, what,
these things are now infectious?

36:59.885 --> 37:02.020
But if the hybrids
can turn the animals,

37:02.053 --> 37:03.465
i-it doesn't matter that
we've stopped the beacons

37:03.489 --> 37:05.424
or destroyed the hybrid nests.

37:05.457 --> 37:07.935
Then Abigail can turn the entire
animal population into her army.

37:07.959 --> 37:09.928
But we still got the barrier.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.401
And as long as it holds,
we can keep the spread under control.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.801
Clem.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.269
(tires screech)

37:17.303 --> 37:18.470
Dad!

37:18.504 --> 37:19.681
What's the matter? Are you okay?

37:19.705 --> 37:21.773
The baby! The baby's gone!

37:21.807 --> 37:23.718
Where's the baby... what?
The hybrids came out of nowhere,

37:23.742 --> 37:25.377
and then Abigail
came, and then...

37:25.411 --> 37:27.289
What happened to the baby?
What? The baby is gone!

37:27.313 --> 37:29.047
Are you sure it was Abigail?
Yes, I'm sure.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.017
Abigail came, and then,
she took the baby.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.919
The hybrids came in
and Logan is dead.

37:35.421 --> 37:38.357
What?

37:38.390 --> 37:39.691
Oh...

37:42.027 --> 37:44.330
Oh, my God.

37:44.363 --> 37:46.298
DARIELA: Echo Team
was hit in transit.

37:46.332 --> 37:47.499
The baby was taken.

37:47.533 --> 37:49.034
I want eyes in the sky now.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.338
You.

37:52.371 --> 37:55.407
If you had put a
bullet in Abigail

37:55.441 --> 37:56.475
when you had the chance,

37:56.508 --> 37:57.719
none of this would've happened,

37:57.743 --> 37:59.345
and Logan would still be alive!

37:59.378 --> 38:00.822
I tried as hard as
anybody to put her down!

38:00.846 --> 38:02.414
ABRAHAM: Logan
was only out there

38:02.448 --> 38:05.484
because you and Mitch wanted
to move Clem and the baby.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.317
If you had kept him here,
where he was safe...

38:10.021 --> 38:11.899
Garrison's scrambling
whoever he can send out now.

38:11.923 --> 38:14.035
But mobilizing additional
resources is going to take time.

38:14.059 --> 38:15.427
We don't have time.

38:15.461 --> 38:16.538
If I don't administer the drug

38:16.562 --> 38:18.330
in the next four hours,

38:18.364 --> 38:20.632
we lose our chance at
the sterility cure.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.635
(phone vibrates) JAMIE: What,
you think Abigail's gonna be easy to find?

38:23.669 --> 38:25.347
Every government agency on
Earth is looking for her. Okay,

38:25.371 --> 38:26.781
then we need to start thinking
about our other options.

38:26.805 --> 38:27.973
(tablet beeps)

38:28.006 --> 38:29.375
Hello?

38:29.408 --> 38:32.077
Hello, brother.

38:32.110 --> 38:33.679
JACKSON: If you hurt him,

38:33.712 --> 38:36.348
Abigail, I swear to
God, I will kill you.

38:36.382 --> 38:38.517
The baby's fine.

38:38.550 --> 38:41.420
He's beautiful.

38:41.453 --> 38:44.623
Logan, though, not so much.

38:45.924 --> 38:47.526
What do you want?

38:47.559 --> 38:51.096
The same thing I
have always wanted.

38:51.129 --> 38:53.665
For my hybrids to roam free,

38:53.699 --> 38:56.935
everywhere.

38:56.968 --> 39:01.940
You give me that,
and I'll give him back.

39:04.476 --> 39:06.144
No. (chuckles)

39:06.177 --> 39:07.979
No, no, t-there's no
way that those hybrids

39:08.013 --> 39:10.382
are getting through the barrier.

39:10.416 --> 39:12.984
You and your friends have
proved very resourceful.

39:13.018 --> 39:16.655
I'm sure you can
figure out a way.

39:16.688 --> 39:17.823
(phone beeps)

39:38.076 --> 39:39.645
JAMIE: All right, I'll, uh...

39:39.678 --> 39:41.188
reach out to some of my
Shepherd hunter friends,

39:41.212 --> 39:43.982
maybe they can help, somehow.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.192
Abigail's walking around
with a baby in a world

39:45.216 --> 39:47.586
that hasn't seen a
baby in ten years.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.387
She can't exactly blend in.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.560
I can get the baby back.

39:56.462 --> 39:58.430
That was Abigail; she
wants to make a trade.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.100
Is he okay?
ABRAHAM: What did she say?

40:02.133 --> 40:03.435
He's fine.

40:03.469 --> 40:04.509
She's gonna give him back.

40:06.705 --> 40:08.540
Well, what's she want in return?

40:08.574 --> 40:09.875
(tablet beeps)

40:21.019 --> 40:23.655
Jackson?

40:23.689 --> 40:25.491
What does she want in return?

40:25.524 --> 40:28.960
She wants to get her
hybrids through the barrier.

40:28.994 --> 40:30.629
What? JAMIE: What are you doing

40:30.662 --> 40:32.102
with the plane's
navigational tablet?

40:32.130 --> 40:33.131
It's the only way.

40:33.164 --> 40:34.633
No, no, no, no, no. No, hey!

40:34.666 --> 40:36.502
Hey, hey! Are you insane?

40:36.535 --> 40:37.969
Hey! That is the only thing

40:38.003 --> 40:39.938
that is keeping the
hybrids from spreading,

40:39.971 --> 40:41.491
and infecting all the
animals, Jackson.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.223
JACKSON: We have to
get the baby back.

40:50.682 --> 40:53.652
If you do this,
you're gonna be no better than your dad.

40:53.685 --> 40:56.221
Or your sister.
Jackson is nothing like them.

40:56.254 --> 40:58.624
That baby is the cure,
and he is the only thing

40:58.657 --> 41:00.191
keeping mankind from extinction,

41:00.225 --> 41:02.193
and he is in the
hands of a monster.

41:02.227 --> 41:04.796
You cannot negotiate with her!

41:04.830 --> 41:06.173
If we don't do as she asks,
Abigail won't hesitate

41:06.197 --> 41:07.232
in killing that child!

41:07.265 --> 41:09.901
DARIELA: We can't trust
her to hold up her end.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.503
What other choice do we have?

41:14.072 --> 41:16.975
Logan died trying to
protect this baby.

41:19.077 --> 41:20.979
Let's get my baby back, Jackson.

41:28.787 --> 41:31.056
Jackson. Think about it.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.060
Every animal in North America

41:35.093 --> 41:36.828
is gonna become part
of her hybrid army.

41:42.067 --> 41:44.002
What then?

41:46.271 --> 41:48.840
One problem at a time, Mitch.

41:48.874 --> 41:50.308
One problem at a time.
