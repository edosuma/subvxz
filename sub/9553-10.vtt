(chanting):
Two, four, six, eight,
who did we annihilate?

01:21.000 --> 01:25.000
Sally's Knit and Yarn Shop!
Hey, hey, hey!

01:25.000 --> 01:26.500
We won, we won!

01:26.500 --> 01:29.010
I don't believe it!

01:29.010 --> 01:31.010
(whistle blows)

01:31.010 --> 01:33.010
Ten-hut!

01:33.010 --> 01:34.510
Whose ball is that?

01:39.050 --> 01:40.630
That figures.

01:40.630 --> 01:43.720
It'll probably end up
being a meatball tomorrow.

01:43.720 --> 01:46.220
Now hear this.

01:46.220 --> 01:48.730
You're looking at the
new Acting Sheriff.

01:48.730 --> 01:50.230
Acting Sheriff?

01:50.230 --> 01:52.230
Yeah, Kirk took over after

01:52.230 --> 01:54.700
the untimely death
of Sheriff Flanagan.

01:54.700 --> 01:57.150
That's the last time he'll
change a tire without a jack.

01:59.540 --> 02:02.460
From now on, when you see this
badge, you'll snap to attention.

02:02.460 --> 02:03.540
Is that clear?
ALL (mumbling):
Yes, sir.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.040
I can't hear you!

02:05.040 --> 02:06.040
CROWD (shouting):
Yes, sir!

02:06.040 --> 02:06.910
That's better.

02:09.300 --> 02:12.300
Do you call that attention?

02:12.300 --> 02:14.800
I was a 4-F.

02:14.800 --> 02:17.300
Suck in that stomach,
push out that chest,

02:17.300 --> 02:18.810
pull in that nose.

02:21.310 --> 02:24.590
Forget it... you've
done all you could.

02:26.650 --> 02:29.730
"To all concerned:

02:29.730 --> 02:32.190
"This is no longer
a wide-open town.

02:34.190 --> 02:37.770
"The following hood elements
are expected to be out of town

02:37.770 --> 02:39.280
"in 24 hours.

02:39.280 --> 02:40.740
"Rocky Baruffi."

02:40.740 --> 02:42.110
(murmured agreement)

02:42.110 --> 02:43.280
"Knuckles Schultz."

02:43.280 --> 02:45.080
That's even better--
he's really mean. Yeah.

02:45.080 --> 02:47.170
"Fonzie Fonzarelli."

02:49.340 --> 02:50.420
What?!

02:50.420 --> 02:51.920
RICHIE:
Come on, not Fonzie.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.540
I wouldn't want to be the one
to tell Fonzie to leave town.

02:55.540 --> 02:57.590
What's that?

02:58.130 --> 03:01.100
I said I wouldn't want
to be the one to tell
Fonzie to leave town.

03:01.100 --> 03:03.550
You got the cap, you got
the badge, you do it.

03:06.050 --> 03:09.060
You have been hanging around
these kids too long.

03:09.560 --> 03:12.060
A little kitchen inspection
will straighten you out,

03:12.060 --> 03:13.110
4-F draft dodger.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.690
I got a deviated septum.

03:17.200 --> 03:18.780
Evans, don't ever
do that to me.

03:18.780 --> 03:22.370
Kitchen duty is a little bit
out of our territory,

03:22.370 --> 03:23.870
Who is the sheriff?

03:23.870 --> 03:25.370
You are.

03:25.370 --> 03:26.660
Remember that.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.160
KIRK:
All right, inspection!

03:28.160 --> 03:31.460
Move it out! Now!
Hup two, hup two, hup!

03:31.460 --> 03:32.550
Move it out!

03:32.550 --> 03:34.550
(music playing on jukebox)
POTSIE:
Crazy.

03:34.550 --> 03:36.550
What's that guy got
against Fonzie?

03:36.550 --> 03:39.670
You know, somebody
ought to stand up to that bully.

03:39.670 --> 03:40.750
You're right.

03:41.250 --> 03:42.760
Hello? Give me
the White House.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.970
Hello, Ike...

03:43.970 --> 03:44.920
Hang up the phone, Ralph.

03:46.810 --> 03:48.390
I just hung up
on the president.

03:48.390 --> 03:50.260
(girls shrieking)

03:55.570 --> 03:57.570
Hold it.

03:57.570 --> 03:59.070
Hey, girls,
when you're doing that,

03:59.070 --> 04:01.570
I want to hear, "Fonzie, Fonzie,
he's our man" with gusto!

04:01.570 --> 04:02.580
A little life!

04:02.580 --> 04:03.580
GIRLS:
Fonzie, Fonzie...!

04:03.580 --> 04:05.500
Fonz, Fonz, you've
got to bend down.

04:05.500 --> 04:09.080
You got to hide-- we'll talk
to you in your office.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.580
I want to tell you something:
Sure.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.090
This this better be important,

04:12.090 --> 04:14.590
or you're going to leave
my office through the pipes.

04:14.590 --> 04:16.589
Bending ain't cool.

04:20.209 --> 04:21.290
Cunningham...

04:21.290 --> 04:22.800
It's okay to
stand up now.

04:22.800 --> 04:24.300
Thank you very much.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.300
I tell you something,
this better be important,

04:26.300 --> 04:28.300
you know, because three
cheerleaders in the hand

04:28.300 --> 04:31.100
is worth a lot more than
three nerds in a john.

04:34.940 --> 04:36.530
Fonz, Sheriff Kirk's
been looking for you.

04:37.030 --> 04:38.530
Hey, I don't know that?

04:38.530 --> 04:39.530
He's like my shadow.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.030
I lost him this morning
in the cemetery

04:41.030 --> 04:42.570
when his fender
hit a tombstone.

04:42.570 --> 04:44.280
That's a good one, Fonz.

04:44.280 --> 04:45.370
(loud knocking on door)

04:45.370 --> 04:47.870
KIRK:
Open up in the name
of the law!

04:47.870 --> 04:48.870
What do we do?

04:48.870 --> 04:50.870
Open up! He's going
to throw tear gas!

04:50.870 --> 04:52.380
My eyes get all red.

04:52.380 --> 04:55.380
Let him in, cops have
a right to use the john.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.750
♪ He's a dog... ♪

05:04.750 --> 05:05.840
Hello, Kirk.

05:05.840 --> 05:08.340
Hey, listen, bring your car
by the garage sometime,

05:08.340 --> 05:10.640
I'll get the granite out
of your grill.

05:13.430 --> 05:16.150
What are you doing
in here anyway.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.230
Oh, we're playing
basketball.

05:17.230 --> 05:19.240
Hey, put your arms
out like this.
What?

05:19.240 --> 05:20.240
Two points.

05:20.240 --> 05:22.740
(laughing)

05:22.740 --> 05:25.240
Knock it off,
knock it off!

05:25.240 --> 05:26.740
Why aren't you guys
in the army, anyway?

05:26.740 --> 05:28.240
We're in high school.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.750
That's no excuse,
you pinkos!

05:29.750 --> 05:31.750
March it out of here!
Get it out.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.750
Come on, Malph,
you can't live in there!

05:33.750 --> 05:34.750
Get it out of
there, Malph!

05:34.750 --> 05:35.700
Move it!

05:36.250 --> 05:38.250
Hup, two, three, four,
hup, two...

05:38.250 --> 05:40.420
That man sees
pinkos everywhere.

05:40.420 --> 05:43.680
What is wrong with Kirk?
Oh, whoa.

05:43.680 --> 05:44.760
Well, power makes him crazy.

05:44.760 --> 05:46.760
I was in the Marine
Corps with him.

05:46.760 --> 05:49.770
And he tries to take every
town single-handed.

05:49.770 --> 05:52.640
San Diego, Chula Vista,
Oceanside...

05:58.020 --> 06:00.030
All right, Fonzarelli,
assume the position

06:00.030 --> 06:02.530
and don't try any
funny business.

06:05.030 --> 06:07.900
All right, but if you tickle me,
I'm going to slap your face.

06:13.820 --> 06:17.380
"Eileen Kirk, Granite 9..."

06:17.380 --> 06:19.460
That's my daughter's name!

06:19.460 --> 06:21.500
What is my daughter's
name doing on that wall?

06:21.500 --> 06:24.080
Oh, I'm just kidding,
it ain't up there.

06:24.080 --> 06:25.390
It's in the Yellow Pages.

06:28.170 --> 06:30.170
Ten-hut!

06:33.680 --> 06:34.680
What's that
in your pocket?

06:34.680 --> 06:36.180
Oh, yeah,
that's just a...

06:36.180 --> 06:37.680
Just reach in there with
two fingers, Fonzarelli,

06:37.680 --> 06:39.180
and bring it out slowly.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.070
Watch him, Evans.

06:43.940 --> 06:44.940
(chuckles)

06:44.940 --> 06:47.410
Well, well, well,

06:47.410 --> 06:49.490
carrying a concealed weapon:

06:49.490 --> 06:50.990
The switchblade.

06:50.990 --> 06:52.280
I never would have
believed it.

06:52.280 --> 06:54.360
(imitating Kirk):
Yeah, well, well, well,

06:54.360 --> 06:56.700
you caught me with
the goods, didn't ya?

06:58.030 --> 06:59.540
Yes, we did, Fonzarelli.

06:59.540 --> 07:01.870
You're gonna spend a little
time in the big house.

07:01.870 --> 07:02.960
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.

07:02.960 --> 07:05.460
'Cause I'm going to be
the first man locked up

07:05.460 --> 07:06.760
for carrying a concealed comb.

07:13.430 --> 07:17.520
You see, Kirk, knives ain't
cool, but combs are, huh?

07:17.520 --> 07:18.520
Heyyy...

07:18.520 --> 07:20.520
I gotta wash my hands.

07:20.520 --> 07:21.520
Get out of here,
Cunningham!

07:21.520 --> 07:23.530
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute,

07:23.530 --> 07:26.030
when did washing hands
become against the law?

07:26.030 --> 07:28.110
All right, you got away
with it this time,

07:28.110 --> 07:29.200
but you mark my words,

07:29.200 --> 07:31.320
I'm going to run
you out of town.

07:31.320 --> 07:33.290
What did Fonzie do wrong?

07:33.290 --> 07:34.990
I don't like
the way he looks.

07:34.990 --> 07:36.910
I'm hurt.

07:36.910 --> 07:40.490
And I don't like
the way he dresses.

07:40.490 --> 07:41.990
Hey, just for that, I'm gonna
date your daughter.

07:44.910 --> 07:46.420
I'm gonna nail you,
Fonzarelli.

07:46.420 --> 07:48.420
I'm going to stick
to you like glue.

07:48.420 --> 07:50.250
I'm going to know
every move you make.

07:50.250 --> 07:52.640
Hey, that's great,
maybe you're going
to learn something.

07:56.840 --> 07:58.930
I'm sorry, Fonz.
Heyyy...

07:58.930 --> 08:01.010
KIRK:
Evans, move it out!

08:01.010 --> 08:03.520
I can't stand here all
day waiting for you!

08:08.020 --> 08:10.020
You're bugged, Fonz?

08:10.020 --> 08:12.070
After all those jokes
you were cracking?

08:12.070 --> 08:13.160
He is pushing me.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.110
I can't let him see that,
but he is pushing me!

08:15.110 --> 08:16.750
I can't let him get
away with that.

08:16.750 --> 08:17.830
Well, don't worry, Fonz,

08:17.830 --> 08:19.830
because I'm on your side.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.780
He's gone too far, I'm going
to do something about this.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.710
All right...

08:25.710 --> 08:27.590
you just don't get
yourself in trouble, Red.

08:27.590 --> 08:31.180
No, no, I am really steamed, and
this calls for drastic action.

08:31.180 --> 08:34.130
I'm writing a letter to the
editor of the <i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Milwaukee Journal{\r}.</font></font></i>

08:38.179 --> 08:40.690
That kid is a savage.

HOWARD:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Will someone tell me
what's going on here{\r}?</font></font></i>

08:46.060 --> 08:47.640
Hey, wait a minute,
what's the television set doing

08:47.640 --> 08:50.650
in the middle of the room,
and why is my chair over there?

08:50.650 --> 08:52.620
Well, you know the
piano's coming tomorrow.

08:52.620 --> 08:54.700
Yeah, but Marion,
if I wanted my
chair over there,

08:54.700 --> 08:57.200
I would've put it
there 20 years ago.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.790
I'm going to make a lot of
money giving piano lessons.

08:59.790 --> 09:01.540
First, she needs a student.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.630
No, first I need the piano.

09:02.630 --> 09:04.330
Listen...

09:04.330 --> 09:06.910
Oh, dear, come on over
here and sit down...
Oh, Dad.

09:06.910 --> 09:08.410
and make yourself comfortable.
Put your feet up.

09:08.410 --> 09:10.420
Everything is just the same.
All right, all right.

09:10.420 --> 09:11.920
There's your chair.
There's your paper.

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
There's your life.

09:15.920 --> 09:20.010
Hey, hey, Mom, Dad,
guess what?

09:20.010 --> 09:22.480
The newspaper's gonna print
my letter to the editor.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.510
That's wonderful.

09:23.510 --> 09:25.010
Yeah, I want you
to hear it.

09:25.010 --> 09:27.020
Listen to this:
"Dear Editor..."

09:27.020 --> 09:28.480
You moved the furniture.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.570
Boy, he'll write a
letter about anything.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.110
RICHIE:
Mom...
Uh, dear.

09:33.110 --> 09:37.190
"Dear Editor, are we
going to sit idly by

09:37.190 --> 09:39.200
"while newly-appointed
Sheriff Kirk

09:39.200 --> 09:41.580
carries on his reign
of terror?"

09:41.580 --> 09:43.170
Kirk took over
for Flanagan?

09:43.170 --> 09:45.670
Yeah, Flanagan got
it changing a tire.

"Will we let Kirk's

09:51.790 --> 09:55.340
zealous, selective
enforcement tactics..."

09:55.340 --> 09:57.510
I'm discovering new words.

09:57.510 --> 09:58.550
Good, good.

09:58.550 --> 09:59.850
Go on, Mr. Webster.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.930
"Will we let...
will we let Kirk's

10:01.930 --> 10:04.940
"zealous, selective enforcement
tactics continue?

10:05.440 --> 10:08.440
"Citizens of Milwaukee, our
rights are being threatened.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.390
"Will we stand for this?

10:10.390 --> 10:11.690
I say no!"

10:11.690 --> 10:12.780
No.
No, no.

10:12.780 --> 10:13.780
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.780
Tell me something, what have
you got against Kirk?

10:18.280 --> 10:20.290
Well, he's been
harassing Fonzie.

10:20.290 --> 10:21.790
He wants to run
Fonzie out of town

10:21.790 --> 10:23.370
because he says
he's a hood.

10:23.370 --> 10:24.960
Arthur a hood?

10:24.960 --> 10:25.960
Now that's just silly.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.740
He eats all his vegetables.

10:30.050 --> 10:31.550
Marion, we have
a problem here.

10:31.550 --> 10:34.050
Dad, I think you're
going to have to try

10:34.050 --> 10:35.050
and do something
about this.

10:35.050 --> 10:36.970
Well, now, what do
you suggest I do?

10:36.970 --> 10:38.590
Well, you could bribe him.

10:38.590 --> 10:39.720
What?!

10:39.720 --> 10:41.170
Kidding.

10:41.170 --> 10:44.760
Dad, I think you should
call a special meeting

10:44.760 --> 10:46.260
of the Leopard Lodge.

10:46.260 --> 10:47.760
You're always saying how
influential they are.

10:47.760 --> 10:49.270
Oh, they are.

10:49.270 --> 10:52.270
Who put the net at the
bottom of Lover's Leap?

10:54.270 --> 10:57.270
Richard, has Sheriff Kirk
stepped outside the law

10:57.270 --> 10:58.770
in this thing with Fonzie?

10:58.770 --> 11:01.360
Well, no, but he's
driving Fonzie crazy.

11:01.360 --> 11:04.000
And Fonzie's talking about doing
something pretty desperate.

11:04.000 --> 11:06.580
Oh, listen, Richard,
you're overreacting
to this whole thing.

11:06.580 --> 11:09.290
Fonzie is perfectly capable
of handling the situation.

11:09.290 --> 11:11.670
(doorbell rings)

11:11.670 --> 11:13.260
Oh, who is it?

11:13.260 --> 11:14.260
Fonzie.

11:16.000 --> 11:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:27.770 --> 11:31.270
Fonzie, I almost
didn't recognize you.

11:31.270 --> 11:33.280
Arthur, you look so...

11:33.280 --> 11:35.280
What a lovely tie.

11:35.280 --> 11:37.280
Yeah, I, I came down

11:37.280 --> 11:38.780
to borrow one of, uh,
Mr. C's funny shirts,

11:38.780 --> 11:41.530
you know, with the collars and
the buttons and the cuffs and...

11:41.530 --> 11:45.570
Would you ask him not
to stare at me?

11:45.570 --> 11:47.120
He likes tweed.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.820
Sit down, Richie.

11:48.820 --> 11:51.410
Well, Arthur, aren't you
going to tell us

11:51.410 --> 11:53.830
why you're getting all spiffy?

11:53.830 --> 11:55.920
Well, Officer Kirk,
you know, he follows me

11:55.920 --> 11:57.170
up to Inspiration Point.

11:57.170 --> 11:58.970
Does he just
stand there and peek?

11:58.970 --> 12:00.050
Hey, worse.

12:00.050 --> 12:01.550
He tries to give
my chicks tickets

12:01.550 --> 12:03.010
for lewd and
indecent behavior.

12:03.010 --> 12:05.590
Fonz, dressing up like
this isn't right.

12:05.590 --> 12:07.430
It's like you're giving up.

12:07.430 --> 12:09.510
Giving up nothing.

12:09.510 --> 12:12.520
I got a date with the Hooper
triplets tonight, you know?

12:12.520 --> 12:13.520
Dressed like this,

12:13.520 --> 12:15.320
Officer Kirk's gonna
leave me alone.

12:15.320 --> 12:16.740
So will the Hooper triplets.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.410
They'll adjust.
They'll adjust.

12:22.410 --> 12:26.000
Fonz, if you do this tonight,
then Kirk will beat you.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.700
So will the Hooper triplets.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.700
Listen, Fonzie,
you don't have to do this.

12:30.700 --> 12:32.700
I can call a special meeting
of the Leopards

12:32.700 --> 12:34.200
and we'll get
Kirk off your back.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.700
So will the
Hooper triplets.

12:35.700 --> 12:37.210
Joanie!
Joanie!
Joanie...

12:37.210 --> 12:38.210
I can't help it.

12:38.210 --> 12:39.710
He looks like
Harold Snyder.

12:39.710 --> 12:41.340
(laughs)
Harold Snyder, it's true.

12:41.340 --> 12:42.430
All right, all right,
all right.

12:42.430 --> 12:44.380
Now wait a minute,
wait a minute-- who?

12:44.380 --> 12:45.460
Harold Snyder.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.970
He's the creepy kid
in my class with a runny nose.

12:47.970 --> 12:49.550
All right.

12:49.550 --> 12:51.550
That does it for this
costume right here.

12:51.550 --> 12:53.060
Give this
to Harold Snyder.

12:53.060 --> 12:54.560
Tell him
to wipe his nose.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.190
I must have been crazy!

12:57.190 --> 12:58.780
The Fonz changes for no man!

12:58.780 --> 13:00.780
Hey! Oh!

13:04.320 --> 13:06.200
RALPH:
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">Watch my Dad, he's so quick{\r}.</font></font></i>

13:06.200 --> 13:07.290
He's the best
at this game.

13:07.290 --> 13:08.290
Look at him.

13:08.290 --> 13:09.570
(laughs)

13:09.570 --> 13:12.160
Well, Fonzie's
not here yet.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.660
Well, we better
start the meeting.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.710
He can testify
when he gets here.

13:15.710 --> 13:17.710
All right,
fellas, come on.

13:19.220 --> 13:20.720
Okay...
(gavel bangs)

13:20.720 --> 13:23.220
This special meeting
of the Citizen's Committee

13:23.220 --> 13:25.470
of the Leopard's Lodge
will now come to order.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.560
I got a good one for you.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.560
Why did the moron put
the chicken in hot water?

13:28.560 --> 13:30.060
Why?
Because he wanted
hard-boiled eggs.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.060
(cackles)

13:32.060 --> 13:33.350
Great one!

13:33.350 --> 13:34.430
Yeah, uh, Ralph,

13:34.430 --> 13:36.480
would you and your dad
please sit down, huh?

13:36.480 --> 13:38.570
We have a lot
of fun together.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.320
(tapping gavel)
Fellas...

13:41.320 --> 13:42.820
Please, it's getting late

13:42.820 --> 13:45.320
and we've got to get this
meeting going on now.

13:45.320 --> 13:48.080
We've got some very important
business to discuss here.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.660
Right, right-- we've got
to make a decision

13:49.660 --> 13:51.450
about these
bowling shirts here.

13:51.450 --> 13:53.030
No, wait a minute--
we're here to discuss

13:53.030 --> 13:54.450
the Sheriff Kirk problem.

13:54.450 --> 13:56.000
We've got to make
a decision on these

13:56.000 --> 13:57.540
bowling shirts tonight
or it's going to wind up

13:57.540 --> 14:00.170
like last year,
shirts versus skins.

14:00.170 --> 14:02.540
If I'm not "shirt,"
I'm not bowling.

14:02.540 --> 14:04.130
Now he's not
allowed to talk.

14:04.130 --> 14:05.510
He's not even a Leopard.

14:05.510 --> 14:06.510
That's right,
you're a pledge.

14:06.850 --> 14:07.930
(mouthing)

14:07.930 --> 14:09.130
HOWARD:
All right, now,
look, fellas,

14:09.130 --> 14:11.220
please, we've got
to discuss this

14:11.220 --> 14:13.720
business of Sheriff Kirk
harassing Fonzie.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.720
You mean
I gobbled my dinner

14:15.720 --> 14:17.720
because some hood
is being harassed?

14:17.720 --> 14:19.730
He's entitled
to the same rights

14:19.730 --> 14:21.730
as any other member
of this community.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.730
Well, I think a cop
is doing a good job

14:23.730 --> 14:25.230
if he's picking on a hood.

14:25.230 --> 14:26.730
Yeah, but what's
to stop that cop

14:26.730 --> 14:28.230
from picking on
any one of us?

14:28.230 --> 14:30.370
He wouldn't dare.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.240
HOWARD:
All right, look,

14:32.240 --> 14:33.320
now, we'll start
the testimony.

14:33.320 --> 14:35.040
Potsie, you start off.

14:35.040 --> 14:37.130
Huh? Oh, all right, uh...

14:37.130 --> 14:40.130
I'll take
a medium bowling shirt.

14:40.130 --> 14:41.630
Okay, Potsie,
that's fine.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.130
Ralph, why don't
you talk?

14:43.130 --> 14:44.380
Let Ralph go ahead.
Yeah.

14:44.380 --> 14:46.340
(clears throat)

14:48.420 --> 14:49.510
Last night, Fonzie came

14:49.510 --> 14:52.010
up to Inspiration Point
with the Hooper triplets:

14:52.010 --> 14:53.480
Happy, Joy, and Sunny.

14:53.480 --> 14:55.730
Happy, Joy, and Sunny?

14:55.730 --> 14:57.180
Believe me, Mr. C.,
they are.

14:59.770 --> 15:01.150
Come on, Ralph.

15:02.150 --> 15:03.240
This meeting is

15:03.240 --> 15:05.240
supposed to be
about Sheriff Kirk.

15:05.240 --> 15:07.740
He's harassing Fonz,
and he's not supposed to be

15:07.740 --> 15:09.740
able to get away
with bullying people.

15:09.740 --> 15:11.740
This is a democracy.

15:11.740 --> 15:14.200
Didn't we learn our lesson
with Senator McCarthy?

15:14.200 --> 15:16.500
I voted for
Senator McCarthy!

15:16.500 --> 15:18.580
(doorbell rings)
I wonder who
that could be.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.090
I don't vote,
I'm in business.

15:20.090 --> 15:21.090
Well, you should vote.

15:21.090 --> 15:22.760
I want to tell you
something right now.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.340
MR. MALPH:
I'm in business; I vote.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.840
(all talking at once)

15:30.010 --> 15:31.600
(whistle blows)

15:33.800 --> 15:36.390
This looks like
a 6-14 to me.

15:36.390 --> 15:37.890
But we're just
having a meeting.

15:37.890 --> 15:39.390
Unlawful assembly.

15:39.390 --> 15:40.890
Well, what's
unlawful about it?

15:40.890 --> 15:43.030
No American flag.

15:43.030 --> 15:44.610
What?

15:44.610 --> 15:46.110
Oh, this is a joke, right?

15:46.110 --> 15:47.730
(both laughing)

15:47.730 --> 15:50.070
Aren't you Malph,
the optometrist?

15:50.070 --> 15:51.650
That's right.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.900
I'm Mickey Malph.

15:56.210 --> 15:58.820
You have that sign outside
your office, don't you?

15:58.820 --> 16:00.660
You mean my neon eyeball?

16:00.660 --> 16:03.410
It sticks out too far.
Take it down.

16:03.410 --> 16:05.000
Take down my eyeball?

16:05.000 --> 16:06.500
Oh, no.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.000
I love that
eyeball, Dad.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
It was a wedding
gift from my aunt.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.590
Sit down, Malph.
Yes, sir.

16:11.590 --> 16:13.090
You too, Mickey.

16:15.590 --> 16:18.590
Al, forget about
dancing in your place.

16:18.590 --> 16:20.150
I'm canceling your permit.

16:20.150 --> 16:22.430
What permit?

16:22.430 --> 16:25.520
And Bob, forget about
double-parking your hearse.

16:25.520 --> 16:27.520
But how am I going to
make my deliveries?

16:29.020 --> 16:31.020
Couldn't happen
to any one of us, huh?

16:31.020 --> 16:33.530
Oh, and, uh, Cunningham...

16:33.530 --> 16:36.030
You don't have to tell me,
my loading zone is cancelled.

16:36.030 --> 16:37.530
Right.
Yeah.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.360
It's now a bus stop.

16:40.580 --> 16:42.170
All right, I guess that covers
everything for now.

16:42.170 --> 16:45.170
Any questions?

16:45.170 --> 16:47.670
Well, I suppose that
breaks up the meeting.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.170
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

16:49.170 --> 16:50.680
We could still go
to the mayor.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.680
Yeah, you go to the mayor.

16:52.680 --> 16:54.180
Nobody touches my eyeball.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.180
I'm in business.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.690
Well, Mr. C.,
don't give up yet.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.690
I'm going to talk
some more to my dad.

17:02.690 --> 17:04.690
Yeah, I'm going
to talk to my dad, too.

17:04.690 --> 17:06.690
It'll be the first
time in six months.

17:10.200 --> 17:12.650
How long you gonna
keep this up, Kirk?

17:12.650 --> 17:14.730
KIRK: Until this town
is rid of Fonzarelli

17:14.730 --> 17:15.900
and everybody like him.

17:15.900 --> 17:16.990
What is it?

17:16.990 --> 17:17.990
What have you
got against him?

17:17.990 --> 17:19.460
I don't like
the way he looks,

17:19.460 --> 17:20.490
and I don't like
the way he dresses.

17:20.490 --> 17:22.490
Oh, that's ridiculous.
So is your hat.

17:28.050 --> 17:30.420
♪ La, la... ♪

17:30.420 --> 17:32.000
Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.500
I don't understand
everything you're saying,

17:34.500 --> 17:36.510
but I'm getting your drift.

17:36.510 --> 17:39.510
Kirk's trying to get to me
now, through my friends.

17:39.510 --> 17:41.310
I know what I gotta do.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.100
Don't do anything
rash, Fonz.

17:43.100 --> 17:44.680
Yeah, yeah-- do me
a favor, will you?

17:44.680 --> 17:47.350
You tell Kirk to meet me down
at Arnold's 12:00 midnight.

17:47.350 --> 17:48.430
Sharp.

17:48.430 --> 17:49.820
I'll take
care of this.

17:49.820 --> 17:51.270
I'll take care...

18:03.750 --> 18:06.250
Al?

18:06.250 --> 18:08.250
Where are you, Al?

18:21.020 --> 18:21.930
Where's Al?

18:21.930 --> 18:24.020
I asked for some privacy.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.720
There are some people
that trust the Fonz.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.610
(snickers)

18:31.360 --> 18:34.860
I guess this is
a showdown, Kirk.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.370
I'm ready, Fonzarelli.

18:36.370 --> 18:37.730
I'm ready.
You don't scare me.

18:41.990 --> 18:45.570
Al?

18:45.570 --> 18:48.080
Officer Evans?

18:48.080 --> 18:49.580
Maybe we ought to talk
about this outside

18:49.580 --> 18:51.910
on the street,
in a crowd, out there.

18:53.220 --> 18:55.500
Why don't you just
cool it, Kirk?

18:55.500 --> 18:56.590
"Cool it"?

18:56.590 --> 18:57.500
What does that mean?

19:00.390 --> 19:03.390
That means why don't you grab
yourself together here?

19:03.390 --> 19:05.390
I'm going to leave town tonight.

19:05.390 --> 19:07.980
You're leaving town?

19:07.980 --> 19:09.570
Wait a minute,
this is a trick.

19:09.570 --> 19:10.650
Hey, there are no tricks.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.770
You lay off my friends,
I'll leave town.

19:12.770 --> 19:14.690
You mean, if I leave
your friends alone...

19:14.690 --> 19:16.270
That's right,
as long as Mr. C.

19:16.270 --> 19:18.270
gets back his loading zone,
I'll leave town.

19:18.270 --> 19:19.780
He'll get his
loading zone.

19:19.780 --> 19:21.740
Hey, don't point at me.
That's not polite.

19:24.280 --> 19:26.280
They all said you
were so tough.

19:26.280 --> 19:27.750
You're a beaten man,
Fonzarelli.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.090
Whatever you say, Crew Cut.

19:30.090 --> 19:32.170
<i><font size="24"><font face="Arial">You are the last
of the ducktail{\r}s</font></font></i>

19:32.170 --> 19:33.540
and leather jackets.

19:33.540 --> 19:35.120
Oh, yeah?
What about me, Kirk?

19:42.600 --> 19:44.180
You run Fonzie out of town,

19:44.180 --> 19:45.970
I'll be taking his place.

19:45.970 --> 19:47.050
If you've come looking
for a one-way ticket

19:47.050 --> 19:49.220
out of Milwaukee, you
came to the right place, fella.

19:49.220 --> 19:51.310
You might even run me
out of town, Kirk,

19:51.310 --> 19:54.140
but there'll be another one
to take my place.

20:00.530 --> 20:02.030
And another one!

20:08.040 --> 20:10.040
You won't be able
to get rid of us.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.040
They'll come
from all walks of life:

20:12.040 --> 20:13.550
Store owners.

20:24.590 --> 20:26.590
Children.

20:26.590 --> 20:28.590
Teenagers.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.100
Housewives.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.690
They'll be everywhere, Kirk.

20:38.690 --> 20:40.690
Merchants and townspeople.

20:46.280 --> 20:49.360
Until, at last, there'll be
a sea of leather jackets,

20:49.360 --> 20:51.870
and they'll put an end
to tyranny and injustice

20:51.870 --> 20:53.200
throughout the world.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.510
Whoa, I feel like
I'm in a World War II movie

20:57.510 --> 20:59.460
and the sky's full of planes.

21:00.930 --> 21:02.430
What is this?

21:02.430 --> 21:05.010
What is this,
some kind of a Commie plot?

21:06.630 --> 21:09.220
We're not Commies, Kirk,
and we're not hoods,

21:09.220 --> 21:10.720
and neither is Fonzie.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.720
What gives you the right
to decide how people

21:12.720 --> 21:14.720
should look and how they
should live their lives?

21:14.720 --> 21:16.640
Who died and left you boss?

21:16.640 --> 21:18.030
Sheriff Flanagan.

21:20.280 --> 21:22.860
Now, this is all
unnecessary, folks.

21:22.860 --> 21:23.870
All unnecessary.

21:23.870 --> 21:24.870
Hey, hey,
hey, hey...

21:25.370 --> 21:27.870
Fonzarelli here has
volunteered to leave town.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.370
(group murmuring)

21:29.370 --> 21:30.960
Hey, hey, hey, hey--
hold it, hold it, hold it.

21:30.960 --> 21:32.460
I see I've got
a lot of friends here.

21:32.460 --> 21:33.330
I decided to stay.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.330
Hello, neighbor.

21:42.330 --> 21:43.840
All right.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.340
All right, you people
got to make up your minds.

21:46.340 --> 21:47.840
You've got to choose.

21:47.840 --> 21:50.340
You've got to
choose between him

21:50.340 --> 21:51.840
and your loading zones.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.350
And your eyeballs.

21:53.350 --> 21:55.850
And your hearse! Yeah.

21:55.850 --> 21:57.770
You gotta choose,
right now! Choose!

22:11.250 --> 22:12.200
Bad choice!

22:13.700 --> 22:15.700
I've got to tell you
something, Kirk.

22:15.700 --> 22:17.200
We're having a private little
get-together her.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.700
Unless you have a warrant,

22:18.700 --> 22:20.760
I don't think
you're particularly invited.

22:20.760 --> 22:24.340
Al, I'm ticketing you
for unlawful assembly.

22:24.340 --> 22:27.350
I got my flag...

22:27.350 --> 22:29.850
and my dance permit.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.350
What am I supposed
to do with this?

22:35.350 --> 22:36.860
Sit on it, Kirk.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.440
There we go!

22:42.440 --> 22:44.450
(crowd cheering)

22:47.120 --> 22:49.200
Hey, uh...

22:49.200 --> 22:50.700
I gotta tell you something.

22:50.700 --> 22:52.200
I really thank you very much

22:52.200 --> 22:53.820
for what you did for me,
you know?

22:53.820 --> 22:54.910
Yeah, well, you know,
we didn't really

22:54.910 --> 22:56.740
do it just for you;
we did it

22:56.740 --> 22:58.830
for ourselves, too.
Hey, hey, I know that,
I know that.

22:58.830 --> 23:01.830
But, uh... I'm very happy.

23:02.830 --> 23:04.080
You know, grateful.

23:04.080 --> 23:05.420
Yeah.

23:05.420 --> 23:06.840
Touched.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.840
And, uh, I tell you,
I wish I had a camera right now

23:11.840 --> 23:13.840
to take a picture of you,
'cause this is the last time

23:13.840 --> 23:15.340

like me, 'cause you look silly.

Yeah, bye-bye.

23:44.010 --> 23:47.590
Boy, I tell you, that Evans
is one good policeman.

23:47.590 --> 23:49.090
You know he went
right to the mayor,

23:49.090 --> 23:50.600
told him the whole story,

23:50.600 --> 23:53.100
and now Kirk
is a crossing guard

23:53.100 --> 23:55.970
at the Madison
Elementary School.

24:00.310 --> 24:02.560

I'm glad I didn't lose
the Hooper triplets.

How about "Rock Around

24:21.380 --> 24:23.630
That's a little

24:23.630 --> 24:25.210
Yeah. Sweetheart, play
