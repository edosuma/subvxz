[Gasping]

00:33.385 --> 00:35.319
[Panting]

00:35.387 --> 00:37.548
Can you hear me?

00:39.958 --> 00:41.949
- What happened?
- You nearly died.

00:42.027 --> 00:43.927
Your brain was almost out of oxygen.

00:43.995 --> 00:46.429
You'll be seeing black spots
for the next few days.

00:46.498 --> 00:49.058
The rest of your senses
will recover naturally.

00:49.134 --> 00:51.261
[Coughs]
Did it work?

00:51.336 --> 00:53.099
Did they come?

00:54.839 --> 00:56.739
No, Mr. Walker.

01:04.182 --> 01:06.946
There was no visitation.

01:16.828 --> 01:18.853
<i>I waited as long as I could...</i>

01:18.930 --> 01:21.296
but finally, I had to revive you.

01:27.839 --> 01:30.808
They seem to have repaired
the damage done by the bullet.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.604
[Dry Laugh]

01:33.945 --> 01:35.606
How did you get in here?

01:35.680 --> 01:38.615
I go where Grace goes.
I've been charged to protect her.

01:39.984 --> 01:41.952
Have you?

01:42.020 --> 01:44.011
You can't even protect yourself.

01:44.089 --> 01:46.455
They may have given you speech, Pepper.

01:46.524 --> 01:48.219
Even a parrot can be taught to mimic.

01:48.293 --> 01:50.784
But did they give you
the capacity to think?

01:50.862 --> 01:52.659
I sincerely doubt it.

01:54.532 --> 01:57.365
Tell me, Polly...
What did they put inside her?

01:57.435 --> 01:59.494
I won't tell you anything.

01:59.571 --> 02:01.539
If you're not going to tell me...

02:01.606 --> 02:04.666
then I'll just have to find out
for myself, won't I?

02:04.742 --> 02:07.302
X-rays will harm
the life growing inside of her.

02:07.378 --> 02:10.745
- That's a chance I'm willing to take.
- Stupid man.

02:10.815 --> 02:14.012
You think they'd allow you to continue
your barbaric practice?

02:14.085 --> 02:15.643
She's protected.

02:15.720 --> 02:19.019
Your X-rays won't penetrate her body.
You'll see nothing.

02:19.090 --> 02:20.648
Oh, but they've been watching you.

02:20.725 --> 02:24.161
You think you're like them,
with your clumsy experiments.

02:24.229 --> 02:26.493
But they laugh at you, Dr. Arden.

02:26.564 --> 02:28.259
They make jokes.

02:29.334 --> 02:30.323
Here's a good one.

02:30.401 --> 02:31.732
Knock, knock. Who's there?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.202
Arden. Arden who?

02:33.271 --> 02:36.502
Arden you the quack
who'd make a better duck? [Laughs]

02:36.574 --> 02:38.064
Huh.

02:38.143 --> 02:40.236
Well, if taking X-rays won't work...

02:40.311 --> 02:42.677
perhaps more invasive observation will.

02:42.747 --> 02:46.513
I think her condition calls
for an emergency C-section, don't you?

02:46.584 --> 02:48.074
You can't do that.

02:50.155 --> 02:51.554
Watch me.

02:52.657 --> 02:53.783
[Scalpel Clatters]

02:55.326 --> 02:57.794
Dr. Arden, you still see me
as microcephalic.

02:57.862 --> 02:59.420
No one takes a pinhead seriously.

02:59.497 --> 03:02.830
When my sister's husband drowned her baby
and sliced his ears off...

03:02.901 --> 03:04.391
he told everyone I did it.

03:04.469 --> 03:07.461
They tied me up and paraded me
in front of the judge.

03:07.539 --> 03:12.272
He took one look at the shape of my head,
and I was locked up for good.

03:12.343 --> 03:15.039
That's how it works with us freaks.
We get blamed for everything.

03:15.113 --> 03:17.411
But if something happens
to Grace in here...

03:17.482 --> 03:19.643
and she's harmed in <i>any</i> way...

03:19.717 --> 03:21.708
there won't be anyone else to blame.

03:21.786 --> 03:23.276
They'll take you...

03:23.354 --> 03:26.619
open up your head
and stir your brain with a fork.

03:27.692 --> 03:29.319
Then, when you return...

03:29.394 --> 03:32.124
you'll experience firsthand
how people treat us freaks.

03:32.197 --> 03:34.290
I'll take care of Grace.

03:35.700 --> 03:37.429
Why don't you go to your whore nun...

03:37.502 --> 03:39.834
have her soothe your deflated ego?

03:39.904 --> 03:42.065
[Gasping]

03:53.251 --> 03:55.515
<i>[Thunderclap]</i>

04:49.507 --> 04:54.001
I'm haunted by the idea
that Lee Emerson is still at large.

04:54.078 --> 04:55.568
Believe me, Monsignor...

04:55.647 --> 04:58.411
finding Lee Emerson is a top priority.

04:58.483 --> 05:00.883
They're searching for him
in five different states.

05:00.952 --> 05:02.385
It's a huge manhunt.

05:02.453 --> 05:06.048
I'm filled with remorse
at my blindness about him.

05:06.124 --> 05:08.149
You are not to blame.

05:21.673 --> 05:23.368
I'll be sleeping right there...

05:23.441 --> 05:25.432
if you need something during the night.

05:27.278 --> 05:29.246
<i>[Monsignor Howard]
Have you come for me?</i>

05:34.619 --> 05:36.450
Why are you here?

05:36.521 --> 05:39.046
You have more work to do.

05:39.123 --> 05:42.183
The devil lives at Briarcliff
in your favorite young nun.

05:42.260 --> 05:44.228
You must cast her out.

05:46.931 --> 05:48.762
<i>[Monsignor Howard]
I'm too weak.</i>

05:49.967 --> 05:53.596
- God will help you.
- She'll know.

05:53.671 --> 05:56.936
Guard your thoughts. Use your rosary.

05:58.109 --> 05:59.940
<i>Each bead is his name.</i>

06:03.181 --> 06:05.547
This is your moment, Timothy.

06:06.584 --> 06:09.052
Thank you for everything, Sister.

06:10.488 --> 06:12.285
I'll be back later.

06:12.357 --> 06:15.326
I have to oversee a delivery.

06:15.393 --> 06:17.623
Exciting new things
are happening around here.

06:21.132 --> 06:23.225
[No Audible Dialogue]

06:24.535 --> 06:26.059
[Door Shuts]

06:26.137 --> 06:28.298
[Chattering]

06:30.174 --> 06:32.506
She's doing this to taunt me.

06:34.812 --> 06:37.610
[Whistle Blowing]

06:37.682 --> 06:40.480
People! I have an announcement to make.

06:40.551 --> 06:43.543
As most of you know, recently
our beloved recording of "Dominique"...

06:43.621 --> 06:46.317
was smashed to pieces by someone...

06:46.391 --> 06:48.086
who shall remain nameless.

06:48.159 --> 06:52.789
In fact, I'll just call her
patient number G2573.

06:52.864 --> 06:54.764
But rather than allow...

06:54.832 --> 06:57.096
one bitter woman's
actions ruin things for everyone...

06:57.168 --> 07:00.001
I've decided to take this opportunity...

07:00.071 --> 07:03.336
to bring Briarcliff into the 20th century.

07:03.408 --> 07:05.968
I dug into our rainy-day fund...

07:06.043 --> 07:10.207
and bought this beautiful used jukebox.

07:10.281 --> 07:13.808
I'm sure there's something in there
that can appeal to everyone's taste.

07:13.885 --> 07:16.376
Camels? A pack of Camels?

07:16.454 --> 07:20.447
No, Gerard. It's not a cigarette machine.

07:20.525 --> 07:23.289
It's a great big music box!

07:23.361 --> 07:26.524
And for our maiden number,
I would like to dedicate this one...

07:26.597 --> 07:30.829
to our newest resident,
patient number G2573...

07:30.902 --> 07:34.895
Miss Judy Martin.

07:34.972 --> 07:38.567
- <i>[Chorus] # Ooh, spell #</i>
- Enjoy.

07:38.643 --> 07:42.135
That's your name? Judy Martin?

07:42.213 --> 07:45.671
Not anymore.
We're all just numbers here.

07:45.750 --> 07:47.741

<i># Ooh, spell #</i>

<i># Ooh, spell #</i>

08:06.170 --> 08:08.400
<i># Stop the things you do #</i>

08:08.473 --> 08:11.533
[Whispering]
We have to talk.

08:13.511 --> 08:16.344
- Something's happened.
- Thredson's loose.

08:16.414 --> 08:17.779
How do you know that?

08:17.849 --> 08:19.612
<i># Watch out #</i>

08:31.429 --> 08:32.919
Son of a bitch.

08:32.996 --> 08:35.124
<i>##[Continues, Faint]</i>

08:38.135 --> 08:40.763
Well, well, well, well, well.

08:42.539 --> 08:44.474
Isn't this pleasant,
the three of us sitting around...

08:44.542 --> 08:46.373
like civilized people?

08:49.614 --> 08:52.310
That's a wise move.
I was about to bash your face in.

08:52.383 --> 08:54.010
Hmm.

08:54.085 --> 08:55.746
I know you were.

08:55.820 --> 08:57.879
I admire your pluck.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.253
It's a quality
I hope you'll pass on to our child.

09:01.392 --> 09:02.984
Oh, she didn't tell you either?

09:03.060 --> 09:05.494
Her attempts to self-abort
proved fruitless.

09:05.563 --> 09:09.260
Our baby's strong, Lana. A survivor.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.824
And he's the only thing
that's keeping you alive right now.

09:11.903 --> 09:14.235
As long as he's growing
inside of your womb, you're safe.

09:14.305 --> 09:16.899
Then what happens? You murder me?

09:16.974 --> 09:19.169
Oh, no. I'll have to keep you around...

09:19.243 --> 09:21.108
to breast-feed that baby
for at least the first year.

09:21.178 --> 09:22.668
The health benefits are myriad.

09:22.747 --> 09:25.113
You are one sick twist.

09:26.584 --> 09:30.111
And you're a wanted man.
I wonder if they're offering a reward.

09:30.187 --> 09:31.677
Find out. Turn me in.

09:31.756 --> 09:33.621
Hmm.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

09:33.691 --> 09:35.158
Go to the police...

09:35.226 --> 09:37.592
and your illegally obtained,
taped confession goes with you.

09:38.763 --> 09:42.164
We can discuss that
and other issues tomorrow...

09:42.233 --> 09:43.700
when we resume your treatment.

09:44.969 --> 09:47.733
That's right.
Sister Mary Eunice has offered me...

09:47.805 --> 09:50.035
a full-time position here at Briarcliff.

09:50.107 --> 09:52.632
She's a remarkably forward-thinking
administrator for a nun...

09:52.710 --> 09:56.669
and surprisingly adept
at untying slipknots.

09:56.747 --> 09:58.442

Get out here.

10:20.638 --> 10:21.832

You mocking me?

10:37.622 --> 10:40.090
I don't have time to mock you, Judy.
I have work to do.

10:40.157 --> 10:42.853
A lot of work,
given your epic failure here.

10:42.927 --> 10:45.327
You gave him a job? Are you insane?

10:45.396 --> 10:47.830
- Guards!
- Whoa, whoa.

10:47.898 --> 10:50.992
Dr. Thredson is on the cutting edge
of psychiatric medicine.

10:51.068 --> 10:52.558
We need a guy like him around here...

10:52.637 --> 10:54.264
to whip this place into shape.

10:54.338 --> 10:56.602
Yeah, well, he's here for me,
and you know it.

10:56.674 --> 11:00.041
And when he murders me...
which he will... you will be responsible.

11:00.111 --> 11:03.569
Oh. Quite the contrary, Miss Winters.

11:03.648 --> 11:07.379
Dr. Thredson is concerned for you...
and for your unborn child.

11:08.419 --> 11:10.410
- Take her to hydrotherapy.
- No.

11:10.488 --> 11:12.854
Strip her down
and boil her for 20 minutes.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.584
No!

11:16.761 --> 11:19.093

I do.

11:21.198 --> 11:23.894
[Chuckles]
I bet you do, Judy.

11:24.935 --> 11:26.425
Let's have a look in your room.

11:26.504 --> 11:28.768
Fine. There's nothing in there.

Judy, Judy, Judy.

11:35.813 --> 11:37.405
[Giggling]

11:37.481 --> 11:39.608

I bet you got the idea from Shelley.

11:42.353 --> 11:44.583
[Dry Chuckle]
Very funny.

11:45.656 --> 11:47.920
Do you think about the monsignor?

11:47.992 --> 11:49.755
[Whispering]
Vile thing.

11:50.628 --> 11:52.721
This is awkward for me...

11:52.797 --> 11:55.425
given our prior relationship...

[Grunting]
No, goddamn you. Let me go!

12:08.412 --> 12:09.970
This is sadism!

12:10.047 --> 12:13.278
Quite the contrary. You've exhibited
clear-cut signs of manic depression...

12:13.350 --> 12:15.477
for which electroshock therapy...

12:15.553 --> 12:16.986
- is the prescribed treatment.
- No!

She's right, you know.

27:28.765 --> 27:32.064
and you, Father,
living your life in complete reversal.

27:33.470 --> 27:36.735
Could you wrap your fingers
around my throat...

27:36.806 --> 27:38.364
[Whispering]
And squeeze?

27:38.441 --> 27:39.874
Hmm?

27:43.046 --> 27:45.446
Or will you use your rosary
like you did with Shelley?

27:45.515 --> 27:48.780
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Oh.

27:48.852 --> 27:50.945
You have no secrets from me.

27:52.355 --> 27:55.085
Especially not after what we shared.
I know it all.

27:55.158 --> 27:57.183
But don't worry, Father.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.353
Your little fantasy about killing me...

28:00.630 --> 28:02.655
it hasn't put me off.

28:02.732 --> 28:04.529
Quite the opposite.

28:04.601 --> 28:07.900
I'm gonna make
all of your dreams come true.

28:07.971 --> 28:12.931
We will rise in the hierarchy
of the church together.

28:14.077 --> 28:15.567
Bishop...

28:16.179 --> 28:18.010
cardinal...

28:18.081 --> 28:20.049
dare we even say...

28:21.818 --> 28:23.308
[Whispering]
Pope?

28:24.954 --> 28:27.081
I know it's what you want.
Isn't it, Monsignor?

28:27.157 --> 28:29.489
The desires of the flesh,
they're nothing...

28:29.559 --> 28:35.395
compared to the rewards
of power and ambition.

28:37.767 --> 28:39.758
You don't know me.

28:39.836 --> 28:41.895
I know you're weak.

28:43.206 --> 28:46.607
But I'm strong enough for both of us.

28:46.676 --> 28:48.837
You're mine now...

28:48.912 --> 28:50.743
body and soul.

28:58.321 --> 29:01.051
I'm not yours. I never will be.

29:01.124 --> 29:03.854
I'd rather die than allow you
to defile the Church.

29:03.927 --> 29:06.794
Are you talking?
You've suddenly grown quite tiresome.

29:06.863 --> 29:07.887
You'll not win.

29:07.964 --> 29:09.955
You couldn't even defeat
Sister Mary Eunice.

29:10.033 --> 29:13.002
Her purity remains alive inside.
I know it.

29:13.069 --> 29:16.527
Don't make me reconsider
my largess, Timothy.

29:16.606 --> 29:20.133
I will cast you out and return Mary Eunice
to her state of grace.

29:22.912 --> 29:24.880
- [Groans]
- I gave you a chance, Timothy...

29:24.948 --> 29:26.973
but you've just pissed it away!

29:28.184 --> 29:30.846
I'm done with you...
and with your sweet nun.

29:30.920 --> 29:34.788
I'm about to devour
the last morsel of her soul.

29:37.594 --> 29:39.323
[Sobbing]

29:39.395 --> 29:41.158
[Gasping, Moaning]

29:44.467 --> 29:45.991
I'm sorry, Monsignor.

29:47.470 --> 29:49.631
I'm tired of fighting.

29:52.475 --> 29:54.705
I want to let go.

29:54.778 --> 29:58.714
Then let go of me, Sister.

30:41.124 --> 30:42.887
Take me.

30:44.194 --> 30:46.856
I'll take both of you.

31:00.677 --> 31:02.975
[Monsignor Howard]
We beseech thee, O Lord, in thy mercy...

31:03.046 --> 31:05.480
to have pity on the soul of thy handmaid.

31:05.548 --> 31:08.711
Restore to her that portion
of everlasting salvation...

31:08.785 --> 31:11.310
through Jesus Christ, our Lord.

31:13.723 --> 31:16.123
She's been released from Satan's grip.

31:16.192 --> 31:18.490
Satan's or yours?

31:18.561 --> 31:21.792
I was told she fell from the third floor.

31:21.865 --> 31:24.060
Evidently it was your grip
that failed her.

31:24.133 --> 31:26.601
Her everlasting soul has been set free.

31:27.570 --> 31:30.004
Now we must help it find rest.

31:31.207 --> 31:33.402
It's time to prepare her for burial.

31:33.476 --> 31:35.000
No.

31:35.078 --> 31:37.308
She needs to be cremated.

31:37.380 --> 31:40.144
Cremation is a pagan practice...

31:40.216 --> 31:42.741
and a denial of the doctrine
of resurrection.

31:42.819 --> 31:46.687
Monsignor, the very cells of her body
were corrupted by the devil.

31:47.657 --> 31:49.181
No.

31:49.259 --> 31:51.750
She has to be cremated.

31:51.828 --> 31:53.853
The crematorium here at Briarcliff?

31:53.930 --> 31:55.625
It's still fully functional.

31:55.698 --> 31:58.599
[Sighs]
Very well. I will assist.

31:59.335 --> 32:00.996
That won't be necessary.

32:04.107 --> 32:06.098
I want to do it myself.

32:10.713 --> 32:13.443
As a sign of sanctity...

32:13.516 --> 32:15.746
sometimes God permits the dead body...

32:15.818 --> 32:18.946
to emit an odor of sweet perfume.

32:20.223 --> 32:24.319
It was said that when
Santa Teresa de Ávila died...

32:24.394 --> 32:28.660
the smell of roses lingered
in the convent for days.

32:28.731 --> 32:31.199
What do you smell now, Monsignor?

32:33.369 --> 32:35.394
Nothing but decay.

32:58.628 --> 33:00.152
3:00, right on time.

33:00.229 --> 33:02.857
Want me to stick around?
He's got some attitude today.

33:02.932 --> 33:05.264
We'll be just fine, Carl. Thank you.

33:07.070 --> 33:10.062
There's nothing you can do to me
to make me tell you where that tape's at.

33:10.139 --> 33:12.767
Oh, I'm well aware of that.
I diagnosed you long ago, Kit.

33:12.842 --> 33:16.107
I know you'd rather die
than give me what I want.

33:17.847 --> 33:21.112
But there's an impulse in you that runs
even deeper than your martyr complex...

33:21.184 --> 33:23.209
and that's your savior complex...

33:23.286 --> 33:25.550
particularly when it comes to women...

33:25.621 --> 33:27.350
and, one would assume...

33:29.759 --> 33:31.249
children.

33:35.164 --> 33:37.792
- Kit.
- Grace.

33:39.369 --> 33:42.532
No. That's close enough.

33:42.605 --> 33:44.402
[Baby Cooing]

33:44.474 --> 33:45.964
That's not possible.

33:47.210 --> 33:48.700
- You were...
- Dead?

33:48.778 --> 33:51.542
At least according
to Dr. Arden's postmortem report.

33:51.614 --> 33:54.139
Now, given Grace's condition...

33:54.217 --> 33:55.741
one would either have to, "A"...

33:55.818 --> 33:58.810
judge Arden as guilty of one of the most
egregious misdiagnoses...

33:58.888 --> 34:00.583
in the history of modern medicine...

34:00.656 --> 34:03.955
or conclude that
he's been up to something...

34:04.027 --> 34:07.258
quite extraordinary
in that laboratory of his.

34:07.330 --> 34:08.319
Grace...

34:08.998 --> 34:10.761
says that's your son.

34:14.036 --> 34:16.402
Now, what are we to make of that?

34:19.175 --> 34:20.835
Is it true?

34:22.478 --> 34:23.967
It's true.

34:26.382 --> 34:28.543
You believe her, don't you, Kit?

34:29.752 --> 34:31.811
What are you gonna do?

34:31.888 --> 34:34.652
That's entirely up to you.

34:52.308 --> 34:54.435
What the... What?

34:55.678 --> 34:59.045
I don't want to ruin it for you,
but... Spot jumps.

35:00.116 --> 35:01.947
Where is the tape, you bitch?

35:02.018 --> 35:04.851
Oliver, is that any way to speak to
the mother of your unborn child?

35:04.921 --> 35:06.855
I'm the only one
who knows where it is now.

35:06.923 --> 35:09.118
Kit's not going to find out.

35:09.192 --> 35:11.922
And if you do anything to him,
anything at all...

35:11.994 --> 35:13.655
or anyone else for that matter...

35:13.729 --> 35:16.391
I'll find a way to get it to the police.

35:16.466 --> 35:18.058
You know I can do it, Oliver.

35:18.134 --> 35:20.967
I'm goddamn plucky. Remember?

35:31.581 --> 35:33.071
Margaret.

35:37.653 --> 35:38.745
Kevin.

35:38.821 --> 35:41.984
And, uh, Milton.

35:42.058 --> 35:43.889
[Muttering]

35:43.960 --> 35:45.689
Doris... Dor...

35:45.761 --> 35:47.729
Dori...

35:47.797 --> 35:49.697
No. Dolly. Dolly.

35:51.267 --> 35:52.757
Clyde.

35:52.835 --> 35:54.598
Uh...

35:58.641 --> 36:01.769
- Mother?
- Hello, Jude.

36:01.844 --> 36:03.004
[Sighs]

36:03.079 --> 36:05.877
Mother... Superior.

36:05.948 --> 36:09.076
Claudia. Mother Claudia.

36:10.653 --> 36:13.053
The monsignor said
you were speaking my name.

36:14.524 --> 36:16.458
Wanted to say good-bye.

36:16.526 --> 36:18.289
Good-bye?

36:18.361 --> 36:20.386
I'm going to Rome.

36:21.464 --> 36:23.159
The monsignor...

36:23.232 --> 36:24.961
Taking me to Rome.

36:25.868 --> 36:27.961
We're going to be pope.

36:29.205 --> 36:31.036
We're getting married.

36:33.109 --> 36:34.872
He likes my cooking.

36:37.046 --> 36:39.139
I'm a rare bird.

36:40.016 --> 36:43.645
Is it warm in Rome now?

36:43.719 --> 36:47.211
She tried to steal... him away.

36:47.290 --> 36:51.056
She rubbed her naked body on him.
[Growls]

36:51.127 --> 36:53.925
Ravish Me Red. Ravish Me Red.

36:53.996 --> 36:55.588
Jude.

36:55.665 --> 36:57.428
He killed her.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.263
He had to.

36:59.335 --> 37:02.361
We're getting married in the Vatican.

37:02.438 --> 37:04.235
The devil was jealous.

37:04.307 --> 37:06.275
Try and rest your mind.

37:07.043 --> 37:09.034
You're a little confused.

37:11.847 --> 37:13.405
[Sniffles]

37:16.219 --> 37:19.814
Do you see that woman over there
smoking a cigarette?

37:21.490 --> 37:23.151
[Sighs]

37:23.226 --> 37:24.591
Yes.

37:24.660 --> 37:26.924
Her name is Lana Winters.

37:26.996 --> 37:28.486
She doesn't belong here.

37:28.564 --> 37:30.623
I put her here.

37:32.401 --> 37:34.596
Help her...

37:34.670 --> 37:36.535
get out.

37:57.994 --> 38:00.360
- [Clicks]
- [Flames Ignite]
