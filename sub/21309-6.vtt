00:00.835 --> 00:03.237
NARRATOR:
Previously on The Strain...

00:03.271 --> 00:04.272
I hate you!

00:06.207 --> 00:08.777
I live in this building
with a bunch of other kids.

00:08.810 --> 00:09.844
I was wondering if...

00:09.878 --> 00:11.646
If you could bring them
some of my food?

00:11.680 --> 00:14.482
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.950
FET:
Munchers beat us again.

00:15.984 --> 00:17.418
We're gonna have to steal a pit.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.787
Right, the guys are in.

00:18.820 --> 00:19.854
I told them they could have

00:19.888 --> 00:21.155
all the silver
in the back of that truck.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.858
I didn't see any silver.
They don't know that.

00:23.892 --> 00:24.793
We risked our lives

00:24.826 --> 00:25.994
taking this convoy so that you

00:26.027 --> 00:27.662
could get plutonium
and we could get nothing?

00:27.696 --> 00:28.830
(guns cocking)

00:28.863 --> 00:29.764
(screeching)

00:29.798 --> 00:31.032
(choking)

00:31.065 --> 00:32.767
Let's get out of here!

00:32.801 --> 00:34.435
(tires screeching)

00:34.468 --> 00:36.771
Has there been any word yet?
I have seen

00:36.805 --> 00:39.273
no one of the type
you search for.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.474
(rapid breathing)

00:40.508 --> 00:41.642
You seek me?

00:41.676 --> 00:44.713
You are... an immortal.

00:44.746 --> 00:46.848
My brother. He seeks your gift.

00:46.881 --> 00:49.650
He lies near death,
beyond the help of medicine.

00:49.684 --> 00:51.052
A strix?

00:51.085 --> 00:52.453
The immortal race?

00:52.486 --> 00:54.522
For a time,
I covered the guilty rash

00:54.555 --> 00:57.826
and became quite artful
with stage makeup.

00:57.859 --> 01:00.561
Our Father, which art in heaven,

01:00.594 --> 01:01.662
hallowed be Thy name...

01:01.696 --> 01:02.964
and lead us not into temptation,

01:02.997 --> 01:05.533
but deliver us from evil.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.305
PINSKY:
How much further to Cheyenne?

01:11.339 --> 01:13.141
250 miles.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.876
BEN:
You got a plan?

01:14.909 --> 01:17.511
Well, National Guard's
got an armory.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.181
I figure we'll start
looking there for supplies.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.516
(guns cocking) EICHHORST:
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:24.853 --> 01:26.654
Just hold it right there,
Brooks Brothers.

01:26.687 --> 01:30.058
Chilly out here, yes?

01:30.091 --> 01:32.226
It is if your dumb ass
forgot a coat.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.394
What do you want?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.063
Information.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.098
I am looking for two men.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.667
Well, one man.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.072
Vasiliy Fet?
And a half-breed named Quinlan.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.712
So... you have seen them.

01:51.746 --> 01:55.116
Any idea where
I might find them?

01:55.149 --> 01:57.418
Probably somewhere
east of here,

01:57.451 --> 01:58.719
looking for an airfield.

01:58.753 --> 02:00.354
Shut your goddamn pie hole.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.923
We don't owe them a thing.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.792
SOBs nearly got us killed,
and for nothing.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.361
In that case,

02:07.395 --> 02:09.730
I have good news

02:09.764 --> 02:12.233
and I have bad news.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.970
The good news is...
I am taking

02:16.004 --> 02:19.107
that truck off your hands.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.441
(Pinsky chuckling)

02:20.474 --> 02:21.575
Just like that, huh?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.144
Just like that.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.745
What's the bad news?

02:24.779 --> 02:27.782
The bad news is...

02:27.816 --> 02:33.421
I only need one of you
to drive it.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.323
He's a strigoi! Kill him!

02:35.356 --> 02:36.757
(grunts, bones snapping)

02:36.791 --> 02:38.126
(screeching)

02:44.132 --> 02:46.835
Congratulations.

02:46.868 --> 02:48.336
Tonight is

02:48.369 --> 02:50.872
your lucky night.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.542
â™ª

03:53.167 --> 03:54.969
Jesus Christ!

03:55.003 --> 03:56.804
I'm standing next
to a fully pitted nuke.

03:56.837 --> 03:57.906
Can you be a little more
careful?

03:57.939 --> 03:59.840
We left New York
more than nine months ago.

03:59.874 --> 04:01.542
Time is of the essence.
Yeah.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.345
Well, the airfield's not far,
should take us less than a day.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.180
You're certain we'll be able
to get a plane?

04:06.214 --> 04:08.382
Certain-ish.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.986
The guy who runs it, Dooley,
had about a half a dozen

04:12.020 --> 04:13.888
aircraft last time I heard.

04:13.922 --> 04:15.556
Good.
Uh...

04:15.589 --> 04:17.191
wouldn't start

04:17.225 --> 04:18.859
popping corks.

04:18.893 --> 04:21.062
We have to actually see
if he wants to trade.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.196
Why would he not?

04:22.230 --> 04:23.932
All our ammunition,
food and vehicles

04:23.965 --> 04:25.833
for just one plane
is more than reasonable.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.536
Yeah, well, Dooley...

04:28.569 --> 04:30.905
ain't exactly reasonable.

04:30.939 --> 04:34.042
Former Special Forces,
it's his way or the highway.

04:34.075 --> 04:36.677
Then I'll show him my way.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.878
(crow cawing)

04:37.912 --> 04:39.280
You keep staring
at me like that,

04:39.313 --> 04:41.749
I ain't coming
to New York. Seriously.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.052
Why are you coming?

04:44.085 --> 04:45.886
Seriously.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.757
(laughs) Look who's got jokes.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.559
I figured I'd
have a better chance

04:51.592 --> 04:54.095
with you guys than by myself.

04:54.128 --> 04:57.398
We made a pretty good team
so far, right?

04:57.431 --> 04:58.299
CHARLOTTE: Oh, really?
FET: Mmm.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.401
Oh, yeah?
(grunts): Oh!

05:00.434 --> 05:03.204
You're so tough.
You're so tough. Put me...

05:03.237 --> 05:05.606
down.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.141
Put me down!
Now?

05:07.175 --> 05:08.576
Thank you.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.643
I suppose we have.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.811
CHARLOTTE:
It's cold out.

05:10.844 --> 05:11.980
FET: Cold.

05:13.281 --> 05:15.283
It's not cold.

05:20.121 --> 05:22.423
(Fet chuckling)

05:22.456 --> 05:25.026
CHARLOTTE: Really?
Mm-hmm.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.431
Are you feeling OK, Quinlan?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.166
Can I collect you
some more blood?

05:32.200 --> 05:35.036
That won't be necessary;
thank you, Charlotte.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.139
Fet, a word?

05:39.673 --> 05:40.975
Oh, go on.

05:41.009 --> 05:43.311
I'll fetch you
some more fresh coffee.

05:45.879 --> 05:49.250
Why the long face,
Born-o? Huh?

05:49.283 --> 05:52.020
I mean,
today's the day we get to...

05:52.053 --> 05:54.455
leave this frozen wasteland.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.324
Charlotte cannot come.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.758
Excuse me?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.760
Her usefulness has passed.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.496
Yeah.
That's not for you to decide.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.964
This is my mission.

06:03.998 --> 06:05.099
And you wouldn't
have completed it

06:05.133 --> 06:07.335
without me or Charlotte.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.137
For that I'm grateful.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.039
But now we must focus
on the next steps.

06:11.072 --> 06:12.473
She will only slow us down.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.009
Charlotte has
risked her life for us

06:15.043 --> 06:16.944
more times than I can count.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.812
So don't you dare
question her commitment.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.548
I'm not.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.317
I'm questioning yours.

06:23.351 --> 06:24.685
CHARLOTTE:
Everything OK here?

06:24.718 --> 06:28.022
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're good.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.727
Make sure that we are, Fet.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.011
I found you!

06:51.045 --> 06:51.912
(chuckling)
Catch me.

06:51.945 --> 06:55.349
(laughing)

06:55.383 --> 06:58.219
Lydia, to bed please.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.388
Miss Richmond will be here
to watch you soon.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.756
But I want to play
with Mr. Quinlan.

07:04.092 --> 07:05.726
LOUISA: He'll be back
soon enough.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.027
Say good night to Mr. Quinlan.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.267
We'll continue
our games tomorrow.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.081
We're going to the theater.

07:27.115 --> 07:31.219
I've... never been.

07:31.252 --> 07:33.387
I know.

07:37.258 --> 07:40.294
LOUISA: We mustn't dally.
The curtain is at eight.

07:40.328 --> 07:43.431
No one's ever accused me
of dallying before.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.066
I must've lost the time
whilst watching Lydia.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.701
My apologies.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.571
I appreciate how good
you are with her.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.641
Hello.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.379
She was so withdrawn

07:58.412 --> 08:00.581
after her uncle passed, but...

08:00.614 --> 08:02.450
now she's opened up;

08:02.483 --> 08:04.952
she listens to you.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.956
Clearly, she needs a father
figure in her life.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.092
Because her true father
remains a mystery?

08:12.126 --> 08:14.395
We're nearly there.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.630
(snarling)

08:20.334 --> 08:23.171
(snarling)

08:23.204 --> 08:24.838
Stay back.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.011
(growling)

08:32.146 --> 08:33.547
(snarling)

08:38.018 --> 08:39.153
(grunting)

08:42.690 --> 08:44.625
(snarling)

08:46.294 --> 08:47.195
(screeching, bones snapping)

08:47.228 --> 08:48.562
Quinlan!

08:51.199 --> 08:54.802
Invictus?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.870
Is that you?

09:00.708 --> 09:01.675
You've come.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.278
And I shall come for you.

09:04.312 --> 09:06.680
(snarling)

09:06.714 --> 09:08.182
(bones snapping)

09:14.188 --> 09:15.789
All right, all right,

09:15.823 --> 09:17.057
let's load up, everyone,

09:17.090 --> 09:19.159
before Q has an aneurysm.

09:19.193 --> 09:21.462
I can think of worse things.

09:21.495 --> 09:23.331
CHARLOTTE: Hold up!

09:23.364 --> 09:24.432
I'm coming.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.974
Uh, can I help?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.676
I can handle it.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.548
Well, there's not much
that you can't handle.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.782
What's up?

09:42.750 --> 09:43.917
Quinlan... um...

09:46.086 --> 09:49.657
He thinks that, um...
you shouldn't come to New York.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.159
But before you say a thing,
I just want you to know

09:52.192 --> 09:54.027
that I told him
that it's not his call.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.597
You know, that, uh...

09:56.630 --> 09:59.267
You've done more
for us than anyone else.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.169
We owe you everything.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.372
But, uh...

10:04.405 --> 10:07.275
then it dawned on me
that, you know,

10:07.308 --> 10:11.712
whether he wants you to stay
or I want you to go or...

10:11.745 --> 10:12.746
It doesn't really matter

10:12.780 --> 10:15.449
because what
really matters is...

10:15.483 --> 10:19.086
what you want, you know?

10:19.119 --> 10:21.589
So?
So...

10:21.622 --> 10:24.191
you want to come?

10:24.224 --> 10:27.561
To New York? Hmm?

10:27.595 --> 10:30.764
(laughing)

10:30.798 --> 10:33.066
Hell, no.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.102
What?

10:35.135 --> 10:39.239
I mean, you said it was
a suicide mission, right?

10:39.273 --> 10:42.142
Yeah. I... I just...

10:42.175 --> 10:43.544
I just thought that...

10:43.577 --> 10:45.479
Then when we're done here,
I figured that I'd

10:45.513 --> 10:48.115
go out to my dad's
cabin in Montana

10:48.148 --> 10:51.452
and... just live off the land

10:51.485 --> 10:55.523
at least... at least
as long as I can.

10:57.291 --> 11:00.093
Yeah, that, well... that...

11:00.127 --> 11:02.796
that... that sounds...
that sounds nice, actually.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.799
Well, it's better
than the alternative.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.867
Right?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.274
Yeah.

11:14.308 --> 11:16.143
I guess.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.014
Good.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.418
Wait a second.

11:24.452 --> 11:26.587
Did you just break up with me?

11:26.620 --> 11:28.221
Huh? Hey!

11:38.131 --> 11:40.634
(indistinct speaking
over loudspeaker)

11:47.174 --> 11:50.277
That was me. Up there,
on the second floor.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.713
I could see
the whole neighborhood

11:52.746 --> 11:54.348
from my desk.

11:54.382 --> 11:59.887
See, um...
my parents coming home.

12:02.356 --> 12:04.592
They were right there
when it hit.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.861
I looked up and they were

12:07.895 --> 12:11.499
at the crosswalk,
looking back at Liberty Island.

12:11.532 --> 12:14.968
The blast wave
rolled through and...

12:15.002 --> 12:16.804
they were just...

12:16.837 --> 12:19.773
gone.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.714
(quiet crying)

12:28.015 --> 12:30.484
â™ª

12:30.518 --> 12:33.320
Sorry.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.757
It's OK. It's not your fault.

12:39.627 --> 12:41.995
(sighs)

12:42.029 --> 12:43.697
Thank you...

12:43.731 --> 12:45.766
for bringing me here.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.436
Of course. No problem.

12:52.039 --> 12:54.542
â™ª

12:56.109 --> 12:58.245
ABBY: You never talk about
your parents.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.715
I assume they're,
uh... you know.

13:01.749 --> 13:03.350
My mom is.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.553
I'm not sure about my dad.

13:05.586 --> 13:07.888
You don't know what
happened to him?

13:07.921 --> 13:10.858
Nope. And I don't care.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.394
You want to talk about it?

13:14.428 --> 13:17.264
My mom was turned.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.666
Shit.

13:20.501 --> 13:24.872
My dad... thought
she was gonna hurt me, but...

13:24.905 --> 13:27.675
she wasn't;
she would never do that.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.045
But he killed her anyway.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.681
I'm sorry.

13:40.454 --> 13:44.825
You know, I still
talk to her sometimes.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.894
I probably sound like a weirdo.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.663
No, I do it, too.

13:49.697 --> 13:51.765
You do?
Yeah,

13:51.799 --> 13:53.834
if I'm feeling low or down,

13:53.867 --> 13:55.969
I think of what
my parents would say.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.439
Makes me feel better.
I guess we're both weirdoes.

13:59.473 --> 14:01.475
Guess so.

14:01.509 --> 14:03.176
This is me.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.345
(indistinct speaking
over loudspeaker)

14:05.378 --> 14:06.680
Oh, hey, wait.

14:10.484 --> 14:12.285
I almost forgot.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.187
What's this?

14:16.890 --> 14:19.259
Plums?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.695
That's so sweet.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.973
Um, I'm gonna just...

14:33.006 --> 14:34.474
Yeah.

14:43.517 --> 14:45.719
(foreboding music)

14:51.158 --> 14:53.393
(dripping)

15:00.233 --> 15:03.971
Zack, what is it
that troubles you?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.706
You wouldn't understand.

15:05.739 --> 15:10.177
I've been studying human nature
for a very long time.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.345
There's nothing

15:12.379 --> 15:15.515
I haven't seen when it
comes to life.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.687
Or love?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.758
There it is.

15:24.792 --> 15:27.094
Who is it?

15:27.127 --> 15:28.896
Abby.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.231
The servant girl?

15:31.264 --> 15:33.400
She's more than that.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.171
At least... I want her to be.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.440
Does she share your feelings?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.943
I don't know.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.878
Have you...

15:44.912 --> 15:47.380
asked?

15:47.414 --> 15:50.283
(sighs) No.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.620
Ask her.

16:00.594 --> 16:02.229
EICHHORST:
You know the area well.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.432
I take it
you are from this region?

16:07.935 --> 16:10.604
Relax, Benjamin.

16:10.638 --> 16:12.405
All you have to do is

16:12.439 --> 16:14.608
get me to the airfield in time.

16:14.642 --> 16:15.976
And you're gonna let me go?

16:16.009 --> 16:18.111
You have my word.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.882
You are Native American,
are you not?

16:21.915 --> 16:24.217
What is your tribe?

16:24.251 --> 16:25.986
Chippewa.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.655
Chippewa.

16:27.688 --> 16:30.958
I've always been fascinated
by the subject.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.593
Hitler was obsessed with it.

16:33.627 --> 16:35.929
He admired the way
the American government

16:35.963 --> 16:39.099
dealt with their...
native problem.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.268
Seems kind of sick,
getting off

16:41.301 --> 16:42.903
on the genocide
of innocent people.

16:42.936 --> 16:45.238
Innocent?

16:45.272 --> 16:48.175
Is it not true
that many of the tribes

16:48.208 --> 16:51.912
turned on their own
in order to help the white man?

16:51.945 --> 16:53.480
It's more complicated
than that.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.349
I don't think so at all.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.585
Take your case. Here you are,

16:58.618 --> 17:01.922
assisting me, selling out
your own species.

17:01.955 --> 17:03.090
I didn't have a choice.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.125
Of course you
had a choice.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.627
You could have chosen
a warrior's death.

17:07.661 --> 17:09.529
An honorable death.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.432
But you chose self-preservation.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.635
You took the coward's way out,

17:15.669 --> 17:18.538
like so many of your ancestors.

17:23.310 --> 17:27.614
All these back roads look
the same in the winter.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.182
I better check the map.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.284
Hold on.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.920
Allow me.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.034
FET: So, uh,

17:47.067 --> 17:50.503
tell me more about this,
um... this cabin.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.841
Four walls... and a roof.

17:53.874 --> 17:56.744
(whistling)
Deluxe, huh?

17:56.777 --> 17:58.846
Why you asking?

18:00.180 --> 18:02.249
Heh. Just curious.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.984
(indistinct speaking over radio)

18:04.017 --> 18:04.918
What was that?

18:04.952 --> 18:06.353
It's the CB.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.155
Somebody, somewhere's
opened up the channel.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.857
FET:
Who the hell else is out here?

18:09.890 --> 18:11.558
And on our frequency?

18:11.591 --> 18:14.261
Bullard Field Regional Airport,
Highway 83

18:14.294 --> 18:15.763
Sounds like Ben.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.330
EICHHORST: Wonderful.
We'll be there shortly.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.066
Is that...

18:19.099 --> 18:20.400
Eichhorst.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.902
Shit.

18:28.909 --> 18:32.179
Quinlan, please! Talk to me.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.881
I don't understand.

18:33.914 --> 18:35.715
There is nothing more to say.

18:35.749 --> 18:39.186
The Master is here in London.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.254
Now is my chance to defeat him.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.290
Why must it be you
who confronts him?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.724
This is my purpose.

18:44.758 --> 18:46.794
To defeat the Master
and his plague.

18:46.827 --> 18:47.828
For protection.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.799
Are you not our protection?

18:53.834 --> 18:56.303
You're not coming back.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.138
Quinlan, no!

18:58.171 --> 19:01.108
What about me?
What about my daughter?

19:01.141 --> 19:04.611
She loves you like a father!
Do we mean nothing to you?

19:04.644 --> 19:08.448
Quite... the opposite.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.653
These past few months...

19:13.686 --> 19:16.456
you have shown me kindness,
accepted me into a world

19:16.489 --> 19:17.757
in which I've never
fully belonged.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.759
For that, I am grateful.

19:19.793 --> 19:22.329
I hope tonight
I can repay you in kind.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.665
(sobbing)

19:25.698 --> 19:29.169
You don't have to do this.

19:29.202 --> 19:32.472
For your sake,
and Lydia's...

19:32.505 --> 19:35.075
I must see this through.

19:35.108 --> 19:38.011
And if you succeed,

19:38.045 --> 19:39.246
your destiny fulfilled,

19:39.279 --> 19:41.014
why then won't you return to us?

19:41.048 --> 19:45.685
The Master's life and mine,
they are entwined.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.821
When I end his...

19:47.855 --> 19:49.789
mine shall also end.

19:49.823 --> 19:52.826
(gasping)
That is the price I must pay.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.331
Yet it cost me so much more.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.133
LYDIA:
Please don't go.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.344
I want you to stay.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.913
So do I, my child.

20:16.016 --> 20:18.151
So do I.

20:18.185 --> 20:19.853
(quiet weeping)

20:22.089 --> 20:23.690
(rock and roll music)

20:23.723 --> 20:26.994
â™ª We'll put them all to sleep
Just by the skin of our teeth â™ª

20:27.027 --> 20:29.829
â™ª Throwin' it in
like a Roman army â™ª

20:29.863 --> 20:32.799
â™ª Tear your way back into
my black heart, baby â™ª

20:32.832 --> 20:36.203
â™ª I waited too long just
to have you slip away again â™ª

20:36.236 --> 20:39.139
â™ª I know we spent so much time
apart now, lately â™ª

20:39.172 --> 20:42.575
â™ª But pulling you closer,
it's me and you until the end â™ª

20:42.609 --> 20:45.645
â™ª Tear your way back into
my black heart, baby â™ª

20:45.678 --> 20:48.848
â™ª I waited too long just
to have you slip away again â™ª

20:48.882 --> 20:51.885
â™ª I know we spent so much time
apart now, lately â™ª

20:51.919 --> 20:55.655
â™ª But pulling you closer,
it's me and you until the end â™ª

20:55.688 --> 20:57.891
â™ª

20:57.925 --> 20:59.592
â™ª We could put on a scene

20:59.626 --> 21:02.429
â™ª But you think you should leave
Floating out â™ª

21:02.462 --> 21:04.164
â™ª With your eyes locked on me

21:04.197 --> 21:07.034
â™ª You tear your way back
into my black heart, baby â™ª

21:07.067 --> 21:08.168
Is Abby coming in?

21:08.201 --> 21:11.671
Not now. Abby coming later.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.540
(snarling)

21:16.609 --> 21:18.311
Stay.

21:30.958 --> 21:33.326
(indistinct speaking)

21:42.302 --> 21:44.471
â™ª

21:53.981 --> 21:56.316
(guitar strumming)

22:02.755 --> 22:04.324
(footsteps)

22:09.529 --> 22:12.232
Everybody gets one.
OK, fine.

22:12.265 --> 22:13.700
Thanks, Abby.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.940
(laughing)

22:31.218 --> 22:32.919
(sinister music)

22:32.952 --> 22:36.223
(indistinct chatting)

22:37.457 --> 22:39.392
(laughing)

22:42.062 --> 22:43.963
The cut-through's
right up here on the left.

22:43.997 --> 22:46.299
The hunters use
this fire road in the winter.

22:46.333 --> 22:48.035
It gives good cover;
it should save us time.

22:48.068 --> 22:50.170
FET: We're gonna need it.

22:50.203 --> 22:51.971
Signal's getting weaker,

22:52.005 --> 22:52.972
means we're putting
some distance

22:53.006 --> 22:54.007
between us and them.

22:54.041 --> 22:55.208
For the moment.

22:55.242 --> 22:56.509
You think he's here
because you've got the nuke?

22:56.543 --> 22:57.444
FET: Exactly.

22:57.477 --> 23:00.680
Means the Master's scared.

23:00.713 --> 23:03.316
The only thing more dangerous
than a king rat

23:03.350 --> 23:05.852
is a scared king rat.

23:05.885 --> 23:08.488
He'll throw everything's
he's got at us now.

23:12.325 --> 23:16.496
We need to make better time.
They could be in the air by now.

23:16.529 --> 23:19.866
I'm pushing it
as fast as I can.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.069
(radio static)

23:27.507 --> 23:28.941
(radio clicking off)

23:31.211 --> 23:33.346
How long has this been on?

23:35.715 --> 23:37.584
Pull over.

23:39.586 --> 23:40.687
I didn't know.

23:40.720 --> 23:44.724
I said, pull over.

23:44.757 --> 23:47.227
(tense music)

23:47.260 --> 23:48.195
(accelerating)

23:48.228 --> 23:50.530
What are you doing? Stop!

23:51.264 --> 23:52.365
No!

23:52.399 --> 23:54.000
(grunting)

23:54.033 --> 23:55.335
No!

23:55.368 --> 23:56.536
(tires squealing)

24:00.473 --> 24:02.209
(heavy breathing)

24:05.078 --> 24:06.746
(grunting)

24:07.814 --> 24:10.150
(screeching)

24:29.902 --> 24:31.638
Where the hell
have you brought us?

24:31.671 --> 24:33.773
ROMAN: Only place I know
where we can get an airplane.

24:33.806 --> 24:36.643
And our heads blown clear off.

24:44.151 --> 24:47.654
I got a not-so-great feeling
about this right now.

24:48.755 --> 24:49.822
CHARLOTTE: Jesus!

24:49.856 --> 24:50.790
What the hell was that?

24:50.823 --> 24:52.425
Sniper.
Dooley.

24:52.459 --> 24:53.326
I'll roll out the side,

24:53.360 --> 24:54.227
try to flank him.

24:54.261 --> 24:55.094
I'll push him towards you.

24:55.128 --> 24:56.896
Just, just wait! Just wait.

24:56.929 --> 24:57.797
Just wait.

25:01.168 --> 25:05.104
Sgt. Arthur Dooley.
Captain Daniel Roman here. Over.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.616
He shoots again and we're
taking this place by force.

25:16.649 --> 25:18.251
I'm ready.
Say the word.

25:18.285 --> 25:21.554
Sergeant, do you copy? Over.

25:24.691 --> 25:27.126
What do you want, Roman?

25:30.197 --> 25:31.164
Looking to trade.

25:31.198 --> 25:33.766
Got ammo and supplies.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.436
You and who else?

25:36.469 --> 25:40.106
Just me and three friendlies.

25:40.139 --> 25:43.142
Just, uh, just lookin'
to do some business. That's all.

25:43.176 --> 25:45.912
What is it
you're looking for?

25:48.848 --> 25:51.117
How about an airplane?

25:51.150 --> 25:52.985
(suspenseful music)

26:17.377 --> 26:18.878
Long time, no see, Sergeant.

26:18.911 --> 26:22.014
How are you?
Good.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.251
Stop! What is that thing?
ROMAN: Hey! Whoa! Whoa!

26:24.284 --> 26:25.184
Put that down!
FET: Drop it!

26:25.218 --> 26:26.653
Whoa! Whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

26:26.686 --> 26:27.754
Drop it!

26:27.787 --> 26:29.256
You goddamn collaborators!

26:29.289 --> 26:31.258
Relax!
He's one of the good guys.

26:31.291 --> 26:33.293
DOOLEY: He doesn't look
like one of the good guys.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.996
I can assure you, Sergeant,
you would already be dead

26:37.029 --> 26:40.199
if I were not
one of the good guys.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.276
So, you got a plane for us

26:49.309 --> 26:51.878
or are we just
wasting our time here?

26:51.911 --> 26:55.014
Anyone concerned
that civilian aircraft

26:55.047 --> 26:57.417
have been grounded
since the first nuke blew?

26:57.450 --> 27:00.520
Not really. It concern you?

27:00.553 --> 27:03.423
Depends on what you got
to offer.

27:10.162 --> 27:11.130
ROMAN:
Everything

27:11.163 --> 27:12.332
but that.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.503
So, what do you think?

27:20.940 --> 27:23.976
(door creaking)

27:32.752 --> 27:34.921
DOOLEY:
It's all yours.

27:34.954 --> 27:36.255
ROMAN:
Works for us.

27:36.289 --> 27:39.191
Then let's get you all
off my airfield, huh?

27:46.098 --> 27:48.668
Look, you should hit the road

27:48.701 --> 27:51.971
before the Nazi shows up.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.844
Right.

27:59.646 --> 28:01.280
OK.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.954
Don't go.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.993
Come to the cabin.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.195
We'll be safe

28:16.228 --> 28:18.465
and free.

28:21.668 --> 28:24.203
Come with me.

28:29.241 --> 28:30.643
I can't.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.682
I'm sorry.

28:37.049 --> 28:40.086
You're an idiot.
(chuckles)

28:41.654 --> 28:45.057
I wish I could say
I've never heard that before.

29:03.443 --> 29:06.946
(motor revving)

29:16.423 --> 29:20.159
It is for the best.

29:20.192 --> 29:23.396
I didn't let her go
'cause you wanted me to.

29:23.430 --> 29:24.731
Hell, I would've kidnapped her

29:24.764 --> 29:26.499
just to prove you wrong.

29:26.533 --> 29:29.368
I did it for her.

29:29.402 --> 29:32.038
She deserves better.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.073
Better than me.

29:34.106 --> 29:37.176
That, Mr. Fet, will be
very hard to find,

29:37.209 --> 29:39.345
though I don't doubt
her resourcefulness.

29:39.378 --> 29:43.082
Did I just hear
a compliment in there?

29:43.115 --> 29:44.917
I like to give one

29:44.951 --> 29:47.454
every 100 years or so.

30:01.133 --> 30:05.071
(indistinct shouting)

30:05.104 --> 30:07.607
(horses whinnying)

30:12.679 --> 30:16.983
(slithering)

30:17.016 --> 30:18.284
(gulping)

30:21.654 --> 30:23.490
Fitting...

30:23.523 --> 30:26.158
that I should find
the very embodiment of evil

30:26.192 --> 30:27.827
in the den of such iniquity.

30:30.763 --> 30:33.065
Invictus...

30:33.099 --> 30:35.001
my son.

30:37.470 --> 30:40.439
Much time has passed
since our last encounter.

30:40.473 --> 30:43.976
I hope you have
enjoyed the years...

30:44.010 --> 30:47.446
they will be your last.

30:47.480 --> 30:49.682
(growling)

30:51.651 --> 30:53.019
(groaning)

30:56.455 --> 30:58.825
(grunts)

30:59.659 --> 31:01.027
(gasping)

31:01.060 --> 31:02.495
(grunts)

31:09.902 --> 31:11.804
(screeching)

31:20.880 --> 31:24.517
(gurgling)

31:26.352 --> 31:27.353
And so it ends...

31:28.721 --> 31:32.391
your life and mine.

31:33.826 --> 31:35.027
(groans)

31:42.501 --> 31:45.337
You hesitated,

31:45.371 --> 31:48.007
not ready to die?

31:48.040 --> 31:50.042
Was it...

31:50.076 --> 31:53.345
the woman and her child?

31:53.379 --> 31:55.815
Perhaps...

31:55.848 --> 31:57.884
your new family

31:57.917 --> 32:00.887
should meet your father?

32:00.920 --> 32:04.123
No.
(gusting wind)

32:06.425 --> 32:08.027
No!

32:11.731 --> 32:14.533
(indistinct speaking)

32:19.238 --> 32:21.240
â™ª

32:22.775 --> 32:25.011
Zack?

32:25.044 --> 32:26.245
Hey!

32:26.278 --> 32:27.246
How's it going?

32:27.279 --> 32:29.849
(snarling)

32:29.882 --> 32:31.684
The place is, uh...

32:31.718 --> 32:32.919
somewhat still intact.

32:32.952 --> 32:35.054
I'm kind of shocked.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.590
So... how were the plums?

32:37.624 --> 32:39.191
Oh, uh...

32:39.225 --> 32:42.128
they were amazing.
Thank you, again.

32:42.161 --> 32:45.932
Did your...
boyfriend like them?

32:48.801 --> 32:51.303
Yeah. I saw you with him.

32:51.337 --> 32:54.240
Where?

32:54.273 --> 32:56.776
In your room.

32:56.809 --> 32:59.879
You were spying on me?

32:59.912 --> 33:02.114
I just wanted to talk.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.884
About what?

33:04.917 --> 33:07.319
It doesn't matter now.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.089
Well, it matters to me.

33:10.122 --> 33:11.891
Bullshit.

33:11.924 --> 33:13.626
What is going on with you?

33:13.660 --> 33:15.394
Talk to me.

33:15.427 --> 33:16.963
Zack!

33:16.996 --> 33:19.098
You kissed him!

33:20.366 --> 33:22.168
Yeah, uh...

33:22.201 --> 33:23.636
He's my boyfriend.

33:23.670 --> 33:26.105
I was supposed
to be your boyfriend!

33:26.138 --> 33:29.175
Look, Zack, I'm sorry

33:29.208 --> 33:31.010
but I don't... I don't really

33:31.043 --> 33:32.845
think of you that way.

33:32.879 --> 33:34.781
Why not?

33:34.814 --> 33:37.183
I did everything
I was supposed to.

33:37.216 --> 33:40.119
I was nice to you,
and I gave you all this stuff!

33:40.152 --> 33:42.789
That's not how
to make someone like you.

33:42.822 --> 33:44.691
Then tell me what to do.

33:44.724 --> 33:46.926
I'll do it. I promise.

33:46.959 --> 33:49.195
That's not really
how it works.

33:49.228 --> 33:51.530
And you're a friend,
and you're sweet,

33:51.563 --> 33:53.432
you... you are,

33:53.465 --> 33:56.368
but... you're just a kid.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.006
I'm not a kid!

34:04.911 --> 34:06.478
I'm not cleaning that up.

34:06.512 --> 34:08.681
You will if I tell you to.

34:08.715 --> 34:11.317
You know what?

34:11.350 --> 34:14.286
I can't do this anymore.
I'm out.

34:14.320 --> 34:16.155
You're not leaving!
Watch me.

34:16.188 --> 34:19.058
Abby, wait! Look!

34:19.091 --> 34:20.492
Let go of me!

34:20.526 --> 34:21.627
Please, I'm sorry!

34:21.660 --> 34:22.895
I said, let go,
you little creep!

34:22.929 --> 34:24.997
(snarling)

34:29.001 --> 34:30.202
Call it off, Zack.

34:30.236 --> 34:32.004
(snarling)

34:32.038 --> 34:34.273
I said, call it off!

34:35.908 --> 34:36.909
This isn't funny!

34:36.943 --> 34:39.045
(demonic howling)

34:40.379 --> 34:41.580
Zack, help!

34:44.616 --> 34:45.818
Zack!

34:45.852 --> 34:48.420
Come on!

34:48.454 --> 34:50.757
(snarling)

34:52.458 --> 34:53.425
No!

34:53.459 --> 34:56.495
(screeching)

34:56.528 --> 34:58.130
(gulping)

35:11.911 --> 35:14.881
Louisa? Lydia?

35:26.058 --> 35:28.060
(soft music)

35:32.164 --> 35:34.066
(sighs)

35:48.480 --> 35:51.317
â™ª

36:25.617 --> 36:26.585
(slicing)

36:26.618 --> 36:28.320
(rat squeaking)

36:32.859 --> 36:35.061
(snake hissing)

36:38.197 --> 36:39.198
WOMAN:
Zack.

36:44.136 --> 36:46.038
Go away.

36:46.072 --> 36:46.939
You're upset...

36:46.973 --> 36:49.441
about Abby.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.243
I said I don't want to talk.

36:53.379 --> 36:56.115
People are complicated, Zack.

36:56.148 --> 36:59.051
They lie, they cheat.

36:59.085 --> 37:01.053
They take and take from you

37:01.087 --> 37:04.323
until all you feel
is empty and hollow.

37:04.356 --> 37:07.293
Just like your father did to me.

37:07.326 --> 37:11.730
I did exactly
what I was supposed to do.

37:11.763 --> 37:14.466
But it didn't matter.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.303
Everything I was
afraid of came true.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.071
What were you afraid of?

37:19.105 --> 37:21.640
She wouldn't like me.
No.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.810
You were afraid of losing her.

37:24.843 --> 37:26.545
And now you never will.

37:26.578 --> 37:29.681
I should have helped her.

37:29.715 --> 37:32.418
But you did.

37:32.451 --> 37:34.887
You gave Abby a gift.

37:36.288 --> 37:38.891
You released her from desire

37:38.925 --> 37:40.692
and compulsion...

37:40.726 --> 37:42.694
and all the pain and suffering

37:42.728 --> 37:45.664
that comes with being human.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.599
â™ª

37:47.633 --> 37:49.635
She's part
of the Master's family now.

37:52.371 --> 37:54.340
And she will never...

37:54.373 --> 37:57.910
abandon or betray you again.

38:01.580 --> 38:04.984
(eerie music)

38:12.591 --> 38:13.993
(clicking)

38:23.502 --> 38:25.004
I love you.

38:29.341 --> 38:33.112
(engine roaring)

38:35.181 --> 38:36.082
Good to go?

38:36.115 --> 38:37.083
Cargo's secure.

38:38.250 --> 38:39.451
Shit.

38:39.485 --> 38:41.920
I don't like
the sound of that. What?

38:41.954 --> 38:43.555
Lot of activity on the
storm-scope east of here.

38:43.589 --> 38:45.091
FET:
What does that mean?

38:45.124 --> 38:46.993
It means we might have to
detour around it, which'll

38:47.026 --> 38:48.594
cost us fuel we don't have.

38:48.627 --> 38:50.963
Well, we've got a more
pressing problem right now...

38:52.198 --> 38:53.232
QUINLAN:
We need to go.

38:53.265 --> 38:54.266
Now.

38:54.300 --> 38:55.367
Strap in.

39:04.376 --> 39:06.445
(dramatic music)

39:23.562 --> 39:24.997
(tire bursting)
(gunfire)

39:25.031 --> 39:26.132
(tires squealing)

39:28.834 --> 39:31.003
(tires screeching)

39:42.648 --> 39:44.450
(gunfire)

39:44.483 --> 39:46.218
(screaming)

39:54.593 --> 39:57.163
Come on. Come on!

40:05.671 --> 40:09.475
(gunfire)

40:09.508 --> 40:10.709
Eichhorst is shooting at us!

40:14.846 --> 40:15.881
Ahh!

40:20.719 --> 40:21.887
(grunting)

40:25.291 --> 40:26.625
(grunts)

40:29.261 --> 40:31.130
Scheisse!

40:33.031 --> 40:34.700
We did it! Ha!

40:34.733 --> 40:37.103
We did it! I don't know how

40:37.136 --> 40:39.371
but we did it!
I got a pretty good idea.

40:39.405 --> 40:41.440
She proved you wrong.

40:41.473 --> 40:43.175
Saved our asses.

40:43.209 --> 40:44.543
No.

40:44.576 --> 40:47.012
You saved her and us

40:47.045 --> 40:49.748
by leaving her behind.

40:53.152 --> 40:55.121
Let's just get to New York.
