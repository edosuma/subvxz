NARRATOR:
Previously on The Strain...

00:03.271 --> 00:04.272
I hate you!

00:06.207 --> 00:08.777
I live in this building
with a bunch of other kids.

00:08.810 --> 00:09.844
I was wondering if...

00:09.878 --> 00:11.646
If you could bring them
some of my food?

00:11.680 --> 00:14.482
You have no idea
how much this means to me.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.950
FET:
Munchers beat us again.

00:15.984 --> 00:17.418
We're gonna have to steal a pit.

00:17.451 --> 00:18.787
Right, the guys are in.

00:18.820 --> 00:19.854
I told them they could have

00:19.888 --> 00:21.155
all the silver
in the back of that truck.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.858
I didn't see any silver.
They don't know that.

00:23.892 --> 00:24.793
We risked our lives

00:24.826 --> 00:25.994
taking this convoy so that you

00:26.027 --> 00:27.662
could get plutonium
and we could get nothing?

00:27.696 --> 00:28.830
(guns cocking)

00:28.863 --> 00:29.764
(screeching)

00:29.798 --> 00:31.032
(choking)

00:31.065 --> 00:32.767
Let's get out of here!

00:32.801 --> 00:34.435
(tires screeching)

00:34.468 --> 00:36.771
Has there been any word yet?
I have seen

00:36.805 --> 00:39.273
no one of the type
you search for.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.474
(rapid breathing)

00:40.508 --> 00:41.642
You seek me?

00:41.676 --> 00:44.713
You are... an immortal.

00:44.746 --> 00:46.848
My brother. He seeks your gift.

00:46.881 --> 00:49.650
He lies near death,
beyond the help of medicine.

00:49.684 --> 00:51.052
A strix?

00:51.085 --> 00:52.453
The immortal race?

00:52.486 --> 00:54.522
For a time,
I covered the guilty rash

00:54.555 --> 00:57.826
and became quite artful
with stage makeup.

00:57.859 --> 01:00.561
Our Father, which art in heaven,

01:00.594 --> 01:01.662
hallowed be Thy name...

01:01.696 --> 01:02.964
and lead us not into temptation,

01:02.997 --> 01:05.533
but deliver us from evil.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.305
PINSKY:
How much further to Cheyenne?

01:11.339 --> 01:13.141
250 miles.

01:13.174 --> 01:14.876
BEN:
You got a plan?

01:14.909 --> 01:17.511
Well, National Guard's
got an armory.

01:17.545 --> 01:20.181
I figure we'll start
looking there for supplies.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.516
(guns cocking) EICHHORST:
Good evening, gentlemen.

01:24.853 --> 01:26.654
Just hold it right there,
Brooks Brothers.

01:26.687 --> 01:30.058
Chilly out here, yes?

01:30.091 --> 01:32.226
It is if your dumb ass
forgot a coat.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.394
What do you want?

01:33.427 --> 01:35.063
Information.

01:35.096 --> 01:37.098
I am looking for two men.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.667
Well, one man.

01:39.700 --> 01:44.072
Vasiliy Fet?
And a half-breed named Quinlan.

01:48.209 --> 01:51.712
So... you have seen them.

01:51.746 --> 01:55.116
Any idea where
I might find them?

01:55.149 --> 01:57.418
Probably somewhere
east of here,

01:57.451 --> 01:58.719
looking for an airfield.

01:58.753 --> 02:00.354
Shut your goddamn pie hole.

02:00.388 --> 02:01.923
We don't owe them a thing.

02:01.956 --> 02:03.792
SOBs nearly got us killed,
and for nothing.

02:05.426 --> 02:07.361
In that case,

02:07.395 --> 02:09.730
I have good news

02:09.764 --> 02:12.233
and I have bad news.

02:12.266 --> 02:15.970
The good news is...
I am taking

02:16.004 --> 02:19.107
that truck off your hands.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.441
(Pinsky chuckling)

02:20.474 --> 02:21.575
Just like that, huh?

02:21.609 --> 02:23.144
Just like that.

02:23.177 --> 02:24.745
What's the bad news?

02:24.779 --> 02:27.782
The bad news is...

02:27.816 --> 02:33.421
I only need one of you
to drive it.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.323
He's a strigoi! Kill him!

02:35.356 --> 02:36.757
(grunts, bones snapping)

02:36.791 --> 02:38.126
(screeching)

02:44.132 --> 02:46.835
Congratulations.

02:46.868 --> 02:48.336
Tonight is

02:48.369 --> 02:50.872
your lucky night.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.542
♪

03:53.167 --> 03:54.969
Jesus Christ!

03:55.003 --> 03:56.804
I'm standing next
to a fully pitted nuke.

03:56.837 --> 03:57.906
Can you be a little more
careful?

03:57.939 --> 03:59.840
We left New York
more than nine months ago.

03:59.874 --> 04:01.542
Time is of the essence.
Yeah.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.345
Well, the airfield's not far,
should take us less than a day.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.180
You're certain we'll be able
to get a plane?

04:06.214 --> 04:08.382
Certain-ish.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.986
The guy who runs it, Dooley,
had about a half a dozen

04:12.020 --> 04:13.888
aircraft last time I heard.

04:13.922 --> 04:15.556
Good.
Uh...

04:15.589 --> 04:17.191
wouldn't start

04:17.225 --> 04:18.859
popping corks.

04:18.893 --> 04:21.062
We have to actually see
if he wants to trade.

04:21.095 --> 04:22.196
Why would he not?

04:22.230 --> 04:23.932
All our ammunition,
food and vehicles

04:23.965 --> 04:25.833
for just one plane
is more than reasonable.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.536
Yeah, well, Dooley...

04:28.569 --> 04:30.905
ain't exactly reasonable.

04:30.939 --> 04:34.042
Former Special Forces,
it's his way or the highway.

04:34.075 --> 04:36.677
Then I'll show him my way.

04:36.710 --> 04:37.878
(crow cawing)

04:37.912 --> 04:39.280
You keep staring
at me like that,

04:39.313 --> 04:41.749
I ain't coming
to New York. Seriously.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.052
Why are you coming?

04:44.085 --> 04:45.886
Seriously.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.757
(laughs) Look who's got jokes.

04:49.790 --> 04:51.559
I figured I'd
have a better chance

04:51.592 --> 04:54.095
with you guys than by myself.

04:54.128 --> 04:57.398
We made a pretty good team
so far, right?

04:57.431 --> 04:58.299
CHARLOTTE: Oh, really?
FET: Mmm.

04:58.332 --> 05:00.401
Oh, yeah?
(grunts): Oh!

05:00.434 --> 05:03.204
You're so tough.
You're so tough. Put me...

05:03.237 --> 05:05.606
down.

05:05.639 --> 05:07.141
Put me down!
Now?

05:07.175 --> 05:08.576
Thank you.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.643
I suppose we have.

05:09.677 --> 05:10.811
CHARLOTTE:
It's cold out.

05:10.844 --> 05:11.980
FET: Cold.

05:13.281 --> 05:15.283
It's not cold.

05:20.121 --> 05:22.423
(Fet chuckling)

05:22.456 --> 05:25.026
CHARLOTTE: Really?
Mm-hmm.

05:28.762 --> 05:30.431
Are you feeling OK, Quinlan?

05:30.464 --> 05:32.166
Can I collect you
some more blood?

05:32.200 --> 05:35.036
That won't be necessary;
thank you, Charlotte.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.139
Fet, a word?

05:39.673 --> 05:40.975
Oh, go on.

05:41.009 --> 05:43.311
I'll fetch you
some more fresh coffee.

05:45.879 --> 05:49.250
Why the long face,
Born-o? Huh?

05:49.283 --> 05:52.020
I mean,
today's the day we get to...

05:52.053 --> 05:54.455
leave this frozen wasteland.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.324
Charlotte cannot come.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.758
Excuse me?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.760
Her usefulness has passed.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.496
Yeah.
That's not for you to decide.

06:02.530 --> 06:03.964
This is my mission.

06:03.998 --> 06:05.099
And you wouldn't
have completed it

06:05.133 --> 06:07.335
without me or Charlotte.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.137
For that I'm grateful.

06:09.170 --> 06:11.039
But now we must focus
on the next steps.

06:11.072 --> 06:12.473
She will only slow us down.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.009
Charlotte has
risked her life for us

06:15.043 --> 06:16.944
more times than I can count.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.812
So don't you dare
question her commitment.

06:18.846 --> 06:20.548
I'm not.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.317
I'm questioning yours.

06:23.351 --> 06:24.685
CHARLOTTE:
Everything OK here?

06:24.718 --> 06:28.022
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, we're good.

06:31.392 --> 06:33.727
Make sure that we are, Fet.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.011
I found you!

06:51.045 --> 06:51.912
(chuckling)
Catch me.

06:51.945 --> 06:55.349
(laughing)

06:55.383 --> 06:58.219
Lydia, to bed please.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.388
Miss Richmond will be here
to watch you soon.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.756
But I want to play
with Mr. Quinlan.

07:04.092 --> 07:05.726
LOUISA: He'll be back
soon enough.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.027
Say good night to Mr. Quinlan.

07:10.431 --> 07:13.267
We'll continue
our games tomorrow.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.081
We're going to the theater.

07:27.115 --> 07:31.219
I've... never been.

07:31.252 --> 07:33.387
I know.

07:37.258 --> 07:40.294
LOUISA: We mustn't dally.
The curtain is at eight.

07:40.328 --> 07:43.431
No one's ever accused me
of dallying before.

07:43.464 --> 07:46.066
I must've lost the time
whilst watching Lydia.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.701
My apologies.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.571
I appreciate how good
you are with her.

07:52.740 --> 07:53.641
Hello.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.379
She was so withdrawn

07:58.412 --> 08:00.581
after her uncle passed, but...

08:00.614 --> 08:02.450
now she's opened up;

08:02.483 --> 08:04.952
she listens to you.

08:04.985 --> 08:08.956
Clearly, she needs a father
figure in her life.

08:08.989 --> 08:12.092
Because her true father
remains a mystery?

08:12.126 --> 08:14.395
We're nearly there.

08:14.428 --> 08:16.630
(snarling)

08:20.334 --> 08:23.171
(snarling)

08:23.204 --> 08:24.838
Stay back.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.011
(growling)

08:32.146 --> 08:33.547
(snarling)

08:38.018 --> 08:39.153
(grunting)

08:42.690 --> 08:44.625
(snarling)

08:46.294 --> 08:47.195
(screeching, bones snapping)

08:47.228 --> 08:48.562
Quinlan!

08:51.199 --> 08:54.802
Invictus?

08:54.835 --> 08:56.870
Is that you?

09:00.708 --> 09:01.675
You've come.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.278
And I shall come for you.

09:04.312 --> 09:06.680
(snarling)

09:06.714 --> 09:08.182
(bones snapping)

09:14.188 --> 09:15.789
All right, all right,

09:15.823 --> 09:17.057
let's load up, everyone,

09:17.090 --> 09:19.159
before Q has an aneurysm.

09:19.193 --> 09:21.462
I can think of worse things.

09:21.495 --> 09:23.331
CHARLOTTE: Hold up!

09:23.364 --> 09:24.432
I'm coming.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.974
Uh, can I help?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.676
I can handle it.

09:37.177 --> 09:40.548
Well, there's not much
that you can't handle.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.782
What's up?

09:42.750 --> 09:43.917
Quinlan... um...

09:46.086 --> 09:49.657
He thinks that, um...
you shouldn't come to New York.

09:49.690 --> 09:52.159
But before you say a thing,
I just want you to know

09:52.192 --> 09:54.027
that I told him
that it's not his call.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.597
You know, that, uh...

09:56.630 --> 09:59.267
You've done more
for us than anyone else.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.169
We owe you everything.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.372
But, uh...

10:04.405 --> 10:07.275
then it dawned on me
that, you know,

10:07.308 --> 10:11.712
whether he wants you to stay
or I want you to go or...

10:11.745 --> 10:12.746
It doesn't really matter

10:12.780 --> 10:15.449
because what
really matters is...

10:15.483 --> 10:19.086
what you want, you know?

10:19.119 --> 10:21.589
So?
So...

10:21.622 --> 10:24.191
you want to come?

10:24.224 --> 10:27.561
To New York? Hmm?

10:27.595 --> 10:30.764
(laughing)

10:30.798 --> 10:33.066
Hell, no.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.102
What?

10:35.135 --> 10:39.239
I mean, you said it was
a suicide mission, right?

10:39.273 --> 10:42.142
Yeah. I... I just...

10:42.175 --> 10:43.544
I just thought that...

10:43.577 --> 10:45.479
Then when we're done here,
I figured that I'd

10:45.513 --> 10:48.115
go out to my dad's
cabin in Montana

10:48.148 --> 10:51.452
and... just live off the land

10:51.485 --> 10:55.523
at least... at least
as long as I can.

10:57.291 --> 11:00.093
Yeah, that, well... that...

11:00.127 --> 11:02.796
that... that sounds...
that sounds nice, actually.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.799
Well, it's better
than the alternative.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.867
Right?

11:12.172 --> 11:14.274
Yeah.

11:14.308 --> 11:16.143
I guess.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.014
Good.

11:22.850 --> 11:24.418
Wait a second.

11:24.452 --> 11:26.587
Did you just break up with me?

11:26.620 --> 11:28.221
Huh? Hey!

11:38.131 --> 11:40.634

over loudspeaker)

See, um...
my parents coming home.

12:02.356 --> 12:04.592
They were right there
when it hit.

12:06.360 --> 12:07.861
I looked up and they were

12:07.895 --> 12:11.499
at the crosswalk,
looking back at Liberty Island.

12:11.532 --> 12:14.968
The blast wave
rolled through and...

12:15.002 --> 12:16.804
they were just...

12:16.837 --> 12:19.773
gone.

ABBY: You never talk about
your parents.

12:58.278 --> 13:01.715
I assume they're,
uh... you know.

13:01.749 --> 13:03.350
My mom is.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.553
I'm not sure about my dad.

13:05.586 --> 13:07.888
You don't know what
happened to him?

13:07.921 --> 13:10.858
Nope. And I don't care.

13:10.891 --> 13:14.394
You want to talk about it?

13:14.428 --> 13:17.264
My mom was turned.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.666
Shit.

13:20.501 --> 13:24.872
My dad... thought
she was gonna hurt me, but...

13:24.905 --> 13:27.675
she wasn't;
she would never do that.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.045
But he killed her anyway.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.681
I'm sorry.

13:40.454 --> 13:44.825
You know, I still
talk to her sometimes.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.894
I probably sound like a weirdo.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.663
No, I do it, too.

13:49.697 --> 13:51.765
You do?
Yeah,

13:51.799 --> 13:53.834
if I'm feeling low or down,

13:53.867 --> 13:55.969
I think of what
my parents would say.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.439
Makes me feel better.
I guess we're both weirdoes.

13:59.473 --> 14:01.475
Guess so.

14:01.509 --> 14:03.176
This is me.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.345
(indistinct speaking
over loudspeaker)

14:05.378 --> 14:06.680
Oh, hey, wait.

14:10.484 --> 14:12.285
I almost forgot.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.187
What's this?

14:16.890 --> 14:19.259
Plums?

14:19.292 --> 14:21.695
That's so sweet.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.973
Um, I'm gonna just...

14:33.006 --> 14:34.474
Yeah.

14:43.517 --> 14:45.719
(foreboding music)

14:51.158 --> 14:53.393
(dripping)

15:00.233 --> 15:03.971
Zack, what is it
that troubles you?

15:04.004 --> 15:05.706
You wouldn't understand.

15:05.739 --> 15:10.177
I've been studying human nature
for a very long time.

15:10.210 --> 15:12.345
There's nothing

15:12.379 --> 15:15.515
I haven't seen when it
comes to life.

15:17.384 --> 15:19.687
Or love?

15:22.756 --> 15:24.758
There it is.

15:24.792 --> 15:27.094
Who is it?

15:27.127 --> 15:28.896
Abby.

15:28.929 --> 15:31.231
The servant girl?

15:31.264 --> 15:33.400
She's more than that.

15:35.102 --> 15:38.171
At least... I want her to be.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.440
Does she share your feelings?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.943
I don't know.

15:42.976 --> 15:44.878
Have you...

15:44.912 --> 15:47.380
asked?

15:47.414 --> 15:50.283
(sighs) No.

15:50.317 --> 15:52.620
Ask her.

16:00.594 --> 16:02.229
EICHHORST:
You know the area well.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.432
I take it
you are from this region?

16:07.935 --> 16:10.604
Relax, Benjamin.

16:10.638 --> 16:12.405
All you have to do is

16:12.439 --> 16:14.608
get me to the airfield in time.

16:14.642 --> 16:15.976
And you're gonna let me go?

16:16.009 --> 16:18.111
You have my word.

16:18.145 --> 16:21.882
You are Native American,
are you not?

16:21.915 --> 16:24.217
What is your tribe?

16:24.251 --> 16:25.986
Chippewa.

16:26.019 --> 16:27.655
Chippewa.

16:27.688 --> 16:30.958
I've always been fascinated
by the subject.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.593
Hitler was obsessed with it.

16:33.627 --> 16:35.929
He admired the way
the American government

16:35.963 --> 16:39.099
dealt with their...
native problem.

16:39.132 --> 16:41.268
Seems kind of sick,
getting off

16:41.301 --> 16:42.903
on the genocide
of innocent people.

16:42.936 --> 16:45.238
Innocent?

16:45.272 --> 16:48.175
Is it not true
that many of the tribes

16:48.208 --> 16:51.912
turned on their own
in order to help the white man?

16:51.945 --> 16:53.480
It's more complicated
than that.

16:53.513 --> 16:56.349
I don't think so at all.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.585
Take your case. Here you are,

16:58.618 --> 17:01.922
assisting me, selling out
your own species.

17:01.955 --> 17:03.090
I didn't have a choice.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.125
Of course you
had a choice.

17:05.158 --> 17:07.627
You could have chosen
a warrior's death.

17:07.661 --> 17:09.529
An honorable death.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.432
But you chose self-preservation.

17:12.465 --> 17:15.635
You took the coward's way out,

17:15.669 --> 17:18.538
like so many of your ancestors.

17:23.310 --> 17:27.614
All these back roads look
the same in the winter.

17:27.647 --> 17:29.182
I better check the map.

17:29.216 --> 17:31.284
Hold on.

17:31.318 --> 17:32.920
Allow me.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.034
FET: So, uh,

17:47.067 --> 17:50.503
tell me more about this,
um... this cabin.

17:50.537 --> 17:53.841
Four walls... and a roof.

17:53.874 --> 17:56.744
(whistling)
Deluxe, huh?

17:56.777 --> 17:58.846
Why you asking?

18:00.180 --> 18:02.249
Heh. Just curious.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.984
(indistinct speaking over radio)

18:04.017 --> 18:04.918
What was that?

18:04.952 --> 18:06.353
It's the CB.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.155
Somebody, somewhere's
opened up the channel.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.857
FET:
Who the hell else is out here?

18:09.890 --> 18:11.558
And on our frequency?

18:11.591 --> 18:14.261
Bullard Field Regional Airport,
Highway 83

18:14.294 --> 18:15.763
Sounds like Ben.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.330
EICHHORST: Wonderful.
We'll be there shortly.

18:17.364 --> 18:19.066
Is that...

18:19.099 --> 18:20.400
Eichhorst.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.902
Shit.

18:28.909 --> 18:32.179
Quinlan, please! Talk to me.

18:32.212 --> 18:33.881
I don't understand.

18:33.914 --> 18:35.715
There is nothing more to say.

18:35.749 --> 18:39.186
The Master is here in London.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.254
Now is my chance to defeat him.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.290
Why must it be you
who confronts him?

18:43.323 --> 18:44.724
This is my purpose.

18:44.758 --> 18:46.794
To defeat the Master
and his plague.

18:46.827 --> 18:47.828
For protection.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.799
Are you not our protection?

18:53.834 --> 18:56.303
You're not coming back.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.138
Quinlan, no!

18:58.171 --> 19:01.108
What about me?
What about my daughter?

19:01.141 --> 19:04.611
She loves you like a father!
Do we mean nothing to you?

19:04.644 --> 19:08.448
Quite... the opposite.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.653
These past few months...

19:13.686 --> 19:16.456
you have shown me kindness,
accepted me into a world

19:16.489 --> 19:17.757
in which I've never
fully belonged.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.759
For that, I am grateful.

19:19.793 --> 19:22.329
I hope tonight
I can repay you in kind.

19:22.362 --> 19:25.665
(sobbing)

19:25.698 --> 19:29.169
You don't have to do this.

19:29.202 --> 19:32.472
For your sake,
and Lydia's...

19:32.505 --> 19:35.075
I must see this through.

19:35.108 --> 19:38.011
And if you succeed,

19:38.045 --> 19:39.246
your destiny fulfilled,

19:39.279 --> 19:41.014
why then won't you return to us?

19:41.048 --> 19:45.685
The Master's life and mine,
they are entwined.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.821
When I end his...

19:47.855 --> 19:49.789
mine shall also end.

19:49.823 --> 19:52.826
(gasping)
That is the price I must pay.

19:55.195 --> 19:58.331
Yet it cost me so much more.

19:58.365 --> 20:00.133
LYDIA:
Please don't go.

20:09.209 --> 20:11.344
I want you to stay.

20:11.378 --> 20:12.913
So do I, my child.

Then let's get you all
off my airfield, huh?

27:46.098 --> 27:48.668
Look, you should hit the road

27:48.701 --> 27:51.971
before the Nazi shows up.

27:55.675 --> 27:57.844
Right.

27:59.646 --> 28:01.280
OK.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.954
Don't go.

28:10.857 --> 28:13.993
Come to the cabin.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.195

Come with me.

I can't.
