WEBVTT

00:04.004 --> 00:06.006
<i>Hooch, let's tell them
what happened last week.</i>

00:06.089 --> 00:09.384
Hooch was howling for a reason.
Without knowing his feelings--

00:09.467 --> 00:11.428
I don't care about his feelings.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.471
You don't care? Feelings are important.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.390
You can't bottle them up. Doesn't work.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.600
Erica, you're not really talking
about Hooch anymore, are you?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.436
- Maybe I'm talking about--
- About me.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.354
About Brooke's dad getting me this job.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.481
I mean, I can't ignore those feelings!

00:23.565 --> 00:24.524
We're crushing it.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.359
You know that Mafia case
you helped me with?

00:26.443 --> 00:29.487
They want me to consult on another one
in Boston. Be gone, like, two months.

00:30.155 --> 00:33.950
So you and me will just do, like,
the-- the long-distance thing again?

00:35.035 --> 00:38.455
So you know how I said I would ask about
that road where Dad had his heart attack?

00:38.538 --> 00:40.206
<i>Yeah, it turns out
there's this warehouse out there.</i>

00:40.290 --> 00:41.458
<i>I'll check it out tonight.</i>

00:41.541 --> 00:42.876
- Smell something?

00:42.959 --> 00:46.087
Come back, Hooch!
We're not supposed to be in here, Hooch.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.214
This building's empty.
You just don't like this place?

00:51.051 --> 00:52.635
- Freeze! US Marshal!

00:52.719 --> 00:55.680
- Grady, what are you doing here?
- You're in a lot of trouble, man.

00:59.726 --> 01:02.729
I used to ride in my dad's
patrol car all the time when I was a kid.

01:02.812 --> 01:04.439
Up front.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.316
Not once did I ride in the back.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.693
You wanna know why?
'Cause I was a good boy.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.404
You know who rides in the back? Bad boys.

01:11.988 --> 01:13.907
Don't give me that look.

01:13.990 --> 01:15.116
We're here 'cause of you.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.373
Okay. I think I got it all worked out.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.375
So, after you broke into the warehouse--

01:24.459 --> 01:26.920
- I didn't break in.
- Okay. Anyway.

01:27.003 --> 01:29.631
Diane was on dispatch when I called it in.
You know Diane.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.091
- She had to notify the guy.
- Sure.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.885
The owner came down here after she called,
and he's here now,

01:33.968 --> 01:36.513
but I talked to him,
explained it was just a little mix-up.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.098
I don't think he's gonna press charges

01:38.181 --> 01:40.475
as long as you're willing
to explain yourself.

01:40.558 --> 01:43.978
Why don't you explain yourself, Grady,
sneaking up on me like that?

01:44.062 --> 01:46.231
Dude, I thought you were in danger.

01:46.314 --> 01:48.066
Creeping around.
That's how people get hurt.

01:48.149 --> 01:52.654
Yeah. Like you, Grady.
I almost shot you. Maybe call next time.

01:52.737 --> 01:54.864
Oh, yeah. I'm just gonna call you on my...

01:57.200 --> 02:00.495
Yeah, you know what?
Actually... that is a better idea.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.497
I'm gonna-- I'll just call you next time.

02:08.002 --> 02:11.172
- Mr. Hollis. I'm so sorry.
- Please. Call me Walton.

02:11.256 --> 02:14.467
I-- I-- You know what, it was my dog.

02:14.551 --> 02:17.554
I was checking the area.
He ran inside, and I--

02:17.637 --> 02:18.638
It's no big deal.

02:18.721 --> 02:21.224
I only use this place
when my trucking company needs storage.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.936
Now, um, Officer Garland tells me
you're with the Marshals.

02:25.019 --> 02:26.521
You here on Marshal business?

02:26.604 --> 02:28.773
No. No, no, no. It's-- It's a long story.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.609
I was, uh, checking something
for my sister.

02:31.693 --> 02:35.738
She was, uh, looking into something
my dad was investigating before he died.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.158
Good man, your father.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.368
I met him a couple of times.

02:40.451 --> 02:43.788
The kids would break in here
and vandalize the place,

02:43.872 --> 02:45.832
and he'd chase 'em away.

02:46.875 --> 02:50.461
Like I said though, good guy.
Sorry to hear he passed.

02:50.545 --> 02:51.838
Thanks.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.384
Did you hear of any other
criminal activity in this area?

02:56.467 --> 02:59.387
You know, what our dad was investigating,
I don't know...

03:00.305 --> 03:03.224
- It just felt bigger than vandalism.
- Hmm.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.309
That's so weird.

03:04.893 --> 03:07.020
My dog went nuts
the moment he ran in here.

03:08.229 --> 03:11.399
Now that you mention it,
some kids shot off fireworks in here.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.109
It's probably that. Dogs hate 'em.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.486
Huh. Could be.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.781
Well, I should let you get back home.
Again, I'm very sorry.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.493
Good to meet you,
and condolences again for your dad.

03:22.577 --> 03:23.745
Thanks.

03:25.914 --> 03:27.707
Hey. Are you okay?

03:27.790 --> 03:29.459
Laur. What are you doing here?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.502
I told you to stay away.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.670
Uh, Diane called.

03:32.754 --> 03:36.466
Oh, Diane. Just don't do anything.

03:36.549 --> 03:37.926
Okay, thank you.

03:38.509 --> 03:42.096
Sorry, I would have come sooner,
but I had to drop Matthew with Mom and--

03:42.180 --> 03:43.264
What happened in there?

03:43.348 --> 03:45.683
- Was it drugs? Are there drugs in there?
- There's no drugs.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.770
- Maybe they're small drugs.
- There's nothing in there, Laura. Okay?

03:48.853 --> 03:51.189
- We're lucky that he was cool.
He doesn't look cool.

03:51.272 --> 03:52.982
He looks like a mean coach
in a karate movie.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.693
- I'm gonna go talk to him.
- No. You're not gonna do that. Listen.

03:55.777 --> 03:59.072
He's a perfectly nice guy named Walton
who owns a trucking company

03:59.155 --> 04:01.783
who could have got me in real trouble
if he pressed charges.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.576
Can we just quit while we're ahead,
please?

04:03.660 --> 04:06.246
But, Scott, there has to be a reason
that Dad was looking out here.

04:06.329 --> 04:08.039
Well, it's not in that warehouse.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.070
Oh, hello.

05:22.196 --> 05:24.449
Target is in place. We are good to go.
Teams report.

05:24.532 --> 05:26.200
Conway and White, east flank. Go.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.869
Johnson and Cruz, west flank. Go.

05:27.952 --> 05:31.414
Turner and Wilson,
south back alley backup position. Go.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.498
Rock and roll.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.418
<i>Back Alley Backup.</i>

05:35.501 --> 05:36.919
Is that a show you'd watch?

05:37.003 --> 05:41.341
Tonight on <i>Back
Alley Backup</i>, nothing happens. Nothing.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.719
Well, not nothing.
Hooch is having a very intense experience.

05:44.802 --> 05:46.554
Dude, you're killing me.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.599
We just bought this.
You're getting it all slimy.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.811
You know,
I seriously think Hooch is getting worse.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.022
On Friday, he ran into a warehouse,
went nuts.

05:56.105 --> 05:57.398
Almost got us arrested.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.360
I gotta check in with Erica,
see if she can whip him into shape.

06:00.443 --> 06:01.444
Yeah, must be nice.

06:02.737 --> 06:06.240
The dog training
whenever you feel like it. Nice setup.

06:06.324 --> 06:07.617
We're friends.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.826
It's her job.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.079
She ever ask you to chase a fugitive,

06:11.162 --> 06:12.163
as friends?

06:12.246 --> 06:13.748
That's different, okay? It's not--

06:13.831 --> 06:15.750
<i>Who's got eyes on the target? Anyone?</i>

06:15.833 --> 06:18.044
- I would do stuff for her.
-<i>Nothing on the main floor.</i>

06:22.423 --> 06:25.760
Let's go. Let's go. Come on, bud.
Come on, come on! Let's go, bud!

06:28.012 --> 06:31.099
Turner and Wilson in pursuit!
Headed east down the back alley!

06:32.433 --> 06:34.894
Ah! Bad dog! Get away!

06:37.605 --> 06:39.774
Suspect's surprisingly fast!

06:39.857 --> 06:41.984
No! Stop! Go away!

06:53.121 --> 06:55.456
Back alley backup.
We apprehended the suspect.

06:59.168 --> 07:01.421
You know,
I don't know much about decorating,

07:01.504 --> 07:03.172
but is this, like, a style?

07:03.256 --> 07:05.174
Like, Contemporary Random?

07:05.258 --> 07:07.093
Money-Laundering Modern.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.679
Drug traffickers do this all the time.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.098
Pay cash for fancy stuff, sell it again.

07:12.181 --> 07:13.182
Money's clean.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.229
- Okay, I know you're excited.

07:18.312 --> 07:21.065
It's not even a real dog.
It's just a painting.

07:21.149 --> 07:24.152
Yeah. Fun part's the next step.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.945
We go after the money launderers.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.698
Ooh, yeah, let's get some bad guys.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.200
<i>Back Alley Backup</i> is canceled
after one episode.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.202
What? One episode?

07:34.162 --> 07:35.913
Well, that's a shame.

07:36.497 --> 07:40.460
It's not a real show.
It's-- It's just a joke.

07:40.543 --> 07:41.669
Yeah, I get it.

07:45.965 --> 07:47.467
And they're like, "What?"

07:47.550 --> 07:50.636
So, I get the fugitive's phone coordinates
to our guys at the pier.

07:50.720 --> 07:54.056
He's going in weird circles,
but they just can't find him.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.351
You okay? 'Cause this is a fun story.

07:57.435 --> 08:00.188
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Yeah. I'm-- I'm fine. Mm-hmm.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.856
- Okay, so anyway...
- Okay.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.066
...it turns out he's on a roller coaster.

08:04.150 --> 08:07.069
So the whole time
while they're trying to find him,

08:07.153 --> 08:09.697
he's, like, going...

08:10.740 --> 08:11.741
The roll--

08:12.408 --> 08:15.161
That was the funny part.
Erica. Going in circles.

08:15.244 --> 08:17.163
Oh!

08:17.246 --> 08:19.248
- The roller coaster?
- All right.

08:19.332 --> 08:20.666
Uh, something's wrong.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.085
Spill it. It's Scott again, right?

08:23.169 --> 08:24.837
- No. No, no.
- Yeah.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.005
Uh, yeah, yeah.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.590
- A little bit.
- A lotta bit.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.342
It's just, um...

08:29.425 --> 08:30.426
What?

08:30.510 --> 08:35.473
It's just, um, I might have sort of
tried to tell him

08:35.556 --> 08:36.807
- how I felt.
- Mmm.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.728
Girl. We talked about this.
Do you remember?

08:40.811 --> 08:44.315
I said, in clear, simple English,

08:44.398 --> 08:48.528
"Don't tell him your feelings. Do not."

08:48.611 --> 08:50.696
I know. I remember you said that,

08:50.780 --> 08:53.699
and then it turns out
I am not good at not telling.

08:53.783 --> 08:56.577
I hinted. Not tell. Hint.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.788
And did he get this hint?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.039
Uh...

09:01.374 --> 09:03.668
I think I gave him too hint-y of a hint.

09:03.751 --> 09:05.628
Well, there it is.

09:08.422 --> 09:10.424
Girl. Get up.

09:11.801 --> 09:12.885
I just...

09:12.969 --> 09:14.470
He still comes in with Hooch.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.306
Except for when he forgets our lessons,
which is annoying.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.475
But then he comes in, and I'm just...

09:19.559 --> 09:22.061
He's so cute!

09:22.645 --> 09:25.273
And then I forget
all about being annoyed, you know?

09:25.356 --> 09:27.733
And I know, he is with Brooke. You know?

09:27.817 --> 09:31.404
She's pretty and smart,
and I am a dog trainer.

09:31.445 --> 09:34.198
But then I'm just, like,
there's something.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.324
Or no, you know?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.409
And it's like--

09:38.953 --> 09:39.954
It's just like...

09:40.538 --> 09:41.872
Complicated?

09:41.956 --> 09:43.165
Yes.

09:43.249 --> 09:44.542
You know what you need?

09:44.625 --> 09:46.586
One of those sexy, tropical vacations

09:46.669 --> 09:49.380
where I have a fling with a local guy
and learn to loosen up?

09:49.463 --> 09:51.173
That probably wouldn't hurt. No.

09:51.257 --> 09:54.093
What I'm talking about is boundaries.

09:54.176 --> 09:56.804
Scott's a nice guy,
but he's taking you for granted.

09:56.887 --> 10:00.266
But I can't not feel things.

10:00.349 --> 10:02.727
Hence boundaries.

10:03.311 --> 10:07.023
And if the feels get to be too much,
guess what?

10:07.106 --> 10:09.317
You are not the only dog trainer
in the world.

10:09.442 --> 10:10.526
That's mean.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.736
Erica, no--

10:13.487 --> 10:16.073
Scott is a dog...

10:16.157 --> 10:17.575
- Okay.
-...that's sleeping on the bed,

10:17.658 --> 10:19.327
- shedding on everything.
- Mm-hmm.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.996
You're just putting him in his crate.

10:22.079 --> 10:24.123
See? Is that mean?

10:24.707 --> 10:25.708
No.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.003
- You can do it. You got this.
- Mmm.

10:29.086 --> 10:31.922
- Just put him in his crate.
- Just put him in his crate, girl.

10:32.882 --> 10:33.883
Okay.

10:35.426 --> 10:37.219
<i>Hey, sweetie.</i>
- Hey.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.349
How's my favorite prosecutor?
How's the case? How's, uh-- How's Boston?

10:41.432 --> 10:42.642
Case is shaping up.

10:42.725 --> 10:45.478
And it turns out historic colonial
architecture tours are my thing,

10:45.561 --> 10:47.104
so yay, Boston.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.774
But it doesn't beat
the old city by the bay, does it?

10:49.857 --> 10:52.985
Per the song,
I left my heart in San Francisco.

10:53.069 --> 10:53.986
<i>How's work?</i>

10:54.070 --> 10:55.071
Great. Yeah, yeah.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.907
We just caught this drug trafficker,
and now they're sending us out

10:57.990 --> 10:59.950
to get
his entire money laundering network.

11:00.034 --> 11:01.994
- Nice. Sounds so exciting.

11:02.578 --> 11:06.123
Oh, this is my boss. I gotta run.
I'm proud of you. Miss you.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.208
Miss you.

11:09.210 --> 11:13.130
So, great job catching Mario Fez,
but we still got a lot of work to do.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.715
We got a mansion
of illicit assets to seize

11:14.799 --> 11:16.509
and a money laundering network
to go after.

11:16.592 --> 11:18.469
Hell yeah. A network, baby.

11:18.552 --> 11:19.887
That's what I'm talking about.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.598
We'll be busting doors all week.
Hope you boys are staying fit.

11:22.682 --> 11:28.187
A few sessions at Ocean Beach,
but it's been small, bad wind.

11:28.270 --> 11:29.355
What?

11:29.438 --> 11:30.523
I've been hitting the gym.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.358
Yeah. Stuff at home too, you know?

11:32.483 --> 11:34.777
Stretching, core work, manifesting.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.445
Turner, I've got
a different assignment for you.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.782
You'll be working with Arthur Stilts.
He's handling asset forfeiture.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.993
It appears most of Mr. Fez's property
can be linked to drug smuggling.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.705
I expect
we'll be seizing significant assets.

11:47.206 --> 11:52.420
S-So, they chase bandits
and I-- I pack stuff into boxes?

11:52.503 --> 11:53.963
It's much more than that.

11:54.046 --> 11:58.592
We do histories, catalog,
index, assess auction value.

11:58.676 --> 12:01.929
Oftentimes the items themselves
are quite fascinating.

12:03.097 --> 12:05.808
Last month,
we seized the most amazing stamp.

12:05.891 --> 12:08.769
British Penny Black, 1840.

12:09.353 --> 12:10.646
Pristine.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.858
Black stamp, wow.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.609
That's too much fun for me.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.987
All right, Wilson. Try and keep up.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.281
Look, Turner.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.783
I know it's not what you had in mind,
but this is important.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.118
We get a piece of those assets.

12:24.201 --> 12:26.245
That's a lot of money
for the general fund.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.289
I want total focus.

12:28.372 --> 12:31.250
Yep. On it. Totally focused.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.544
Up. Yeah. That's good.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.773
Just keep the invoice with this one,
all right?

12:58.944 --> 13:02.323
Easy. Easy, bud. Hey. What's wrong?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.995
All right. We'll discuss
the issue of the automobile,

13:08.078 --> 13:11.624
but in terms of art and antiquities,
the final count of items is...

13:11.707 --> 13:13.751
Let me just start the file first.

13:16.295 --> 13:19.089
Uh, no. Sorry, you can't be in here.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.342
Oh, no, no, no, it's okay.
I'm Deputy Turner.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.886
Stephen Marling, facility manager.

13:23.969 --> 13:26.222
Yeah, I meant the dog. It's policy.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.349
In my agreement with the Marshal service.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.226
Right.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.894
Okay. Policy.

13:33.479 --> 13:35.898
All right. It's policy.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.359
Come here, bud. Sorry, Hooch.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.861
It looks like you're gonna miss out
on all the fun.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.322
I'll be back.

13:43.405 --> 13:45.574
So, I'm just gonna email you
my master spreadsheet

13:45.658 --> 13:47.493
so that we can get synchronized
by category.

13:47.576 --> 13:51.831
Uh, our system catalogs by multiple tabs,
so it synchronizes automatically.

13:51.914 --> 13:52.915
Ooh, fascinating.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.043
The signed basketball shoes,
should those be categorized as clothing?

13:56.126 --> 13:58.796
Anything limited edition
should be categorized as collectibles,

13:58.879 --> 14:01.173
but it should be cross-referenced
with clothing...

14:01.882 --> 14:05.302
We're going to need to create
a special summary for articles found...

14:05.928 --> 14:08.931
You can put that in as
an independent subcategory of the 139 B.

14:09.014 --> 14:10.015
Oh, excellent.

14:10.099 --> 14:11.684
Shouldn't take more than another hour.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.687
I'll go, uh, water the K-9 unit.

14:15.271 --> 14:19.066
Uh, so I wanted to point out
an error you made at 216.

14:19.149 --> 14:20.276
- Oh, no.
An error?

14:20.359 --> 14:21.735
No, no.

14:21.819 --> 14:23.487
No, no, no, no.

14:24.905 --> 14:26.073
We might have a situation.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.242
Situation? What situation?

14:28.325 --> 14:31.036
Hooch! Hooch, come on.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.664
I told you specifically,
dogs aren't allowed.

14:33.747 --> 14:37.209
- Why is a pet even in--
- He's not a pet. He's a trained K-9.

14:37.710 --> 14:38.711
Hooch!

14:40.963 --> 14:42.089
Oh, dear.

14:42.172 --> 14:43.299
Is that urine?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.885
Maybe. Uh, it-- it might be drool.

14:46.719 --> 14:48.178
That's not drool.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.305
Hooch.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.390
- Hooch!
- This is so embarrassing.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.776
He's gotta be around here somewhere.

15:03.694 --> 15:04.695
Hooch.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.282
There you are.

15:08.365 --> 15:11.201
- All right. Overall, not that...

15:11.285 --> 15:12.745
-...bad.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.249
<i>Hi, you've reached Erica. Leave a message.</i>

15:17.333 --> 15:18.584
- Hey, Erica.

15:18.667 --> 15:22.463
Um, I'm sorry I've been a little flaky
with the training lately,

15:22.546 --> 15:24.089
but Hooch really needs some work,

15:24.173 --> 15:28.218
so, uh, call me when you get this,
or I'll-- I'll just come in and see ya.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.386
Okay, thanks.

15:34.433 --> 15:36.685
- Laura. What are you doing?
- Scott, we gotta talk.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.398
Hold on. It's 7:15. Did you just drive
here from Cypress Beach?

15:41.482 --> 15:43.776
I couldn't sleep. I was all wrapped up
with the investigation.

15:43.859 --> 15:45.569
I have had a lot of coffee.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.613
Also, it was 5:30 in the morning,
and I was going to call,

15:47.696 --> 15:48.822
but thought, "What the heck?

15:48.906 --> 15:51.450
Matthew's with Grady.
I'll just go to Scott's apartment."

15:51.533 --> 15:53.869
Anyway, I did a little snooping
on this Walton guy. Check it out.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.330
I went by his trucking business,
and I took some pictures.

15:56.413 --> 16:00.000
See the trucks coming in and out
of this place marked danger and flammable.

16:00.084 --> 16:01.585
I mean, that could be anything.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.463
- That could be weapons or bombs.
- Or a million other things.

16:04.546 --> 16:07.299
Okay. All right. Why don't you come
take a look at this picture, huh?

16:08.425 --> 16:09.885
That look innocent?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.470
T-- He has a tattoo.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.263
You have a tattoo.

16:13.347 --> 16:14.723
Of a cute, little sea turtle.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.183
That's a skull.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.435
Name one non-evil thing
whose symbol is a skull.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.229
- Go ahead. No, you can't.
- Give me--

16:20.312 --> 16:23.023
Take a look at this picture.
He's got a gun.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.067
- That's a garage door opener.
- Scott, come on!

16:25.150 --> 16:28.445
Dad is trying to tell us something
about this guy. I know it. I can feel it.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.281
Yes, and maybe it's that there were kids

16:31.365 --> 16:33.325
lighting off firecrackers
in a warehouse somewhere.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.785
You don't believe that.

16:35.911 --> 16:38.706
'Kay, I have to take this. It's the chief.

16:38.789 --> 16:41.166
Oh, by the way, Grateful Dead.
Skull logo. Not evil.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.626
I have no idea what that is.

16:43.460 --> 16:44.545
Jerry Garc-- Okay.

16:45.421 --> 16:48.090
- Hey, Chief. Good morning, how--
<i>You've really done it this time!</i>

16:48.173 --> 16:49.508
<i>Get to the office immediately!</i>

16:49.591 --> 16:51.927
Yes, sir. I, um--
I'll be right in.

16:55.472 --> 16:56.473
I gotta go.

16:59.935 --> 17:01.478
You had one job, Turner.

17:01.562 --> 17:04.273
Keep Mario Fez's assets safe and secure,

17:04.356 --> 17:06.400
which, apparently,
was beneath your dignity.

17:06.483 --> 17:09.319
- And what happens?
- Sir, I swear. Everything was fi--

17:09.403 --> 17:11.864
Was is the key word.
You know what Hooch did yesterday?

17:11.947 --> 17:12.823
Show him.

17:12.906 --> 17:17.327
Authentic Reynard Gadoise, French.
Late Rococo.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.039
I estimated at least 100,000 at auction.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.248
Not anymore.

17:21.331 --> 17:23.834
Your dog got loose in the warehouse.
Is that correct?

17:23.917 --> 17:28.797
Yes, but he was briefly unmonitored
b-b-but contained,

17:28.881 --> 17:32.301
and other than a very small pet mess, I--

17:32.384 --> 17:33.927
I'm sorry. Wh-Who are you?

17:34.011 --> 17:38.599
This is Susan Reacher with
the Office of Professional Responsibility.

17:38.682 --> 17:41.268
- She's handling the review of this mess.
- Internal Affairs?

17:41.351 --> 17:43.228
- Yeah.
- Sir, I--

17:43.312 --> 17:45.522
There's no way
that Hooch could've done this.

17:45.606 --> 17:48.484
You know what?
Save it for the hearing tomorrow at 10:00.

17:50.986 --> 17:53.739
Here's our initial report.
I suggest you review it thoroughly.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.954
- Sir, I swear tha--
- Turner.

18:01.038 --> 18:05.250
You know, the K-9 unit
was the marshal's idea.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.295
Now I've got to tell him
that we just lost 100 grand

18:08.378 --> 18:09.838
because of that K-9 unit.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.758
You're on leave pending this review,

18:12.841 --> 18:15.177
as is, of course, the dog.

18:17.554 --> 18:19.181
That's it. Dismissed.

18:29.108 --> 18:32.277
I miss chasing bandits so much,
my teeth hurt.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.154
Oh.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.782
You see Susan Reacher from IA
lurking around?

18:36.865 --> 18:39.409
- Yeah.
- The Grim Reacher herself?

18:39.993 --> 18:42.246
Someone here is screwed.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.706
It's me. I'm screwed.

18:45.290 --> 18:47.376
- Oh.
- Yeah.

18:47.459 --> 18:51.922
Well, uh, what I heard is that she's tough
but, like, fair, you know?

18:52.923 --> 18:53.966
Wait, so why you?

18:54.049 --> 18:55.425
It's so crazy.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.262
This fancy dog painting got ripped up
in the warehouse,

18:58.345 --> 18:59.638
and they're blaming Hooch.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.808
But I was there, and it just
doesn't seem possible, you know?

19:02.891 --> 19:04.017
Hooch wouldn't do that.

19:04.101 --> 19:05.644
Oh, no. Yeah. He--

19:06.478 --> 19:07.813
That's crazy.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.858
His hearing's tomorrow.
I gotta figure something out.

19:10.941 --> 19:11.859
Yeah.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.444
Aw.

19:16.488 --> 19:18.949
Angel, find it. Find it.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.243
Good girl!

19:21.326 --> 19:24.913
Who's the best girl in the whole world?
Who's the best girl in the whole world?

19:24.997 --> 19:27.332
That's you, Angel. You're the best.

19:27.416 --> 19:28.417
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.962
Erica, I don't know if you got my message,
but I really need your help.

19:32.045 --> 19:33.589
Yeah. Oh, I got your message. Uh-huh.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.551
I actually, unfortunately,
have a very important dog meeting,

19:37.634 --> 19:39.261
um, that I must attend to.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.345
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.514
Because I-I-I kinda have a situation here.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.850
I mean, Hooch is really in trouble,
and I--

19:44.933 --> 19:46.226
I'm sorry.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.396
I can't. I have arranged for you
to work with, uh, Guy.

19:49.479 --> 19:50.480
What guy?

19:50.564 --> 19:53.984
Oh, Guy. Yeah, his actual name is Guy.

19:54.067 --> 19:55.652
That could be confusing, I get that.

19:55.736 --> 19:59.364
But he's a great guy, excellent trainer,
and I think he will do just fine for you.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.658
So he's in the yard in the back.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.620
Okay.

20:04.703 --> 20:06.163
- But you don't come?
- No.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.001
Come on, Hooch.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.173
I put him in his crate.

20:17.925 --> 20:20.510
I'm not saying he's a perfect dog.
He's not, right?

20:20.594 --> 20:22.930
But there's just no way
he destroyed that painting.

20:23.013 --> 20:26.183
Not that he hasn't destroyed stuff before.
He has.

20:26.266 --> 20:28.518
But it's just, this is different.
It's different.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.395
- Different?
- Like, yes.

20:30.479 --> 20:33.482
Yes, he barked at the painting,
but it was more of like a...

20:36.068 --> 20:38.028
You know? It was friendly.
It was like...

20:38.111 --> 20:39.613
Right? That's sweet.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.074
Look, when he sees other dogs,
he wants to make friends,

20:42.157 --> 20:43.992
so I just-- I don't know...

20:44.076 --> 20:46.495
Scott, I'm not a dog therapist.

20:46.578 --> 20:48.914
I'm a dog trainer.
You want me to train your dog, I will.

20:48.997 --> 20:52.167
Otherwise,
it's unclear to me what we're doing.

20:52.251 --> 20:53.418
Yeah, I-- I just--

20:54.503 --> 20:55.963
Hooch's hearing is tomorrow

20:56.046 --> 20:59.174
and with Erica, we used to talk a lot
about Hooch's mindset.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.842
Like, why he did this

21:00.926 --> 21:03.762
or-- or what I thought he was doing
was actually that.

21:03.845 --> 21:04.805
So, what is that?

21:04.888 --> 21:05.847
- Scott.
- Yeah?

21:05.931 --> 21:08.433
- I'm not a dog therapist. I'm a dog...
- Trainer.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.435
Right. Yeah, I forgot. I'm sorry.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.188
Good. So, agility pyramid?

21:15.983 --> 21:18.151
That's not a dog
that destroys stuff, right?

21:20.529 --> 21:21.530
Thanks so much.

21:21.613 --> 21:24.449
Okay, so,
ointment on this leg twice a day,

21:24.533 --> 21:26.159
and keep him away from the cat.

21:26.243 --> 21:28.078
- Sure thing.
- All right. Bye, Roger.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.038
- Bye-bye.
- Be good boy.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.123
Okay.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.083
- See ya.
- Bye.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.334
Hey, buddy. Where were we?

21:34.960 --> 21:36.211
Um...

21:36.295 --> 21:41.216
We're at... "Hippopotomism"?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.510
Hyperthyroidism.

21:43.593 --> 21:46.054
Right. Um, weight loss...

21:46.138 --> 21:47.180
thirst?

21:47.264 --> 21:48.265
God.

21:48.348 --> 21:50.350
- I'm never gonna pass this test.

21:54.313 --> 21:55.605
Good afternoon. Can I help you?

21:56.398 --> 21:58.275
Actually, I think she can.

22:00.152 --> 22:03.572
Catalina, do you wanna, um,
keep an eye on Matthew? Thanks.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.699
Laura Turner?

22:05.782 --> 22:07.576
I met your brother the other night,

22:07.659 --> 22:09.828
but I didn't get a chance
to introduce myself.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.122
Walton Hollis.

22:13.290 --> 22:14.791
Yes, how can I help you?

22:14.875 --> 22:16.626
Just wanna clear the air.

22:16.710 --> 22:19.338
I heard you had some kind
of investigation going,

22:19.421 --> 22:20.881
and as a friend of your father's,

22:20.964 --> 22:24.926
I-- I wouldn't want anyone
thinking anything sketchy was going on.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.428
Oh?

22:26.511 --> 22:28.305
Well, I happened to drive by your office,

22:28.388 --> 22:31.600
and I saw some trucks
with some pretty sketchy warnings on them.

22:31.683 --> 22:33.852
Is there a reason why
you're shipping explosives?

22:33.935 --> 22:35.187
Explosives?

22:35.270 --> 22:37.147
Oh.

22:37.230 --> 22:40.859
Maybe you mean the trucks that take
the oxygen tanks over to the hospital.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.277
Oh.

22:43.278 --> 22:45.739
Well, I also saw you
with a very sketchy-looking man

22:45.822 --> 22:47.949
with a giant skull tattoo
on the back of his head,

22:48.033 --> 22:49.201
and I couldn't help but wonder...

22:49.284 --> 22:50.535
You mean Karl.

22:50.619 --> 22:53.288
Yeah, he looks rough,
but he is a sweetheart.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.665
Okay, he was on a bad path for a while,

22:55.749 --> 22:58.585
but I gave him a job,
set him on the straight and narrow.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.421
A little like your dad's old dog, right?

23:01.505 --> 23:03.799
The cover's rough, but the book is--

23:03.882 --> 23:06.009
Wait. You know Hooch?

23:06.593 --> 23:09.971
Yeah. Yeah. Me and Hooch are old friends.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.973
Ah, I love that crazy dog.

23:13.558 --> 23:16.895
Oh, I... I didn't realize that-- I'm so--

23:18.605 --> 23:21.441
- I'm sorry if I--
No. No worries.

23:22.317 --> 23:25.320
Look, this was my fault for leaving
the door to the warehouse open.

23:26.655 --> 23:30.784
Anyway, um, I'll let you get back to work.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.160
You have a good day, now.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.204
Okay, you too.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.296
[Brooke on phone, sighs] <i>I'm sorry.</i>

23:43.380 --> 23:45.549
<i>I'm pulling a late one
at the office tonight, but what's up?</i>

23:45.632 --> 23:47.676
Well, Hooch's hearing is tomorrow,

23:47.759 --> 23:50.387
and I literally have no time to prepare.

23:50.470 --> 23:51.471
I need your help.

23:51.555 --> 23:55.934
You're a lawyer.
I need, like, strategy or tactics maybe?

23:56.017 --> 24:01.356
Well, a good legal defense focuses on
physical evidence, patterns of behavior,

24:01.440 --> 24:03.024
a viable alternate theory.

24:03.108 --> 24:05.485
Oh, that's good.
That's really good. Great.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.279
That's great. That's great. Keep going.

24:07.362 --> 24:10.031
So, show that he couldn't do it,
wouldn't do it,

24:10.115 --> 24:12.284
and shouldn't be punished
for something someone else did.

24:12.367 --> 24:16.037
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.
Yes, you're saving Hooch. Anything else?

24:16.121 --> 24:18.874
Be a member at the same country club
as the presiding judge?

24:19.458 --> 24:22.169
<i>Listen, I'm really sorry,
but I should probably run.</i>

24:22.752 --> 24:24.504
- Good luck, okay?
-<i>Okay.</i>

24:32.471 --> 24:33.472
All right.

24:48.653 --> 24:49.779
You don't care.

24:53.492 --> 24:54.493
Ready?

24:59.998 --> 25:01.416
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:07.797 --> 25:10.258
Don't worry, buddy. We got this.

25:17.140 --> 25:20.227
Okay. Good, good. You look good, bud.

25:20.310 --> 25:24.564
All right, remember.
Stay calm, act innocent, say nothing.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.446
Good luck in there.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.031
Thanks, but I don't need it.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.741
I've got the data and the facts.

25:35.575 --> 25:38.203
The distance from the door here,

25:38.286 --> 25:42.374
to the painting here, is 150 yards.

25:43.124 --> 25:48.171
Here is Hooch's average speed at a run,
walk and a lope.

25:48.255 --> 25:50.882
An average urination takes five seconds.

25:50.966 --> 25:54.135
Add sniffing time, 27 seconds.

25:54.219 --> 25:58.557
Now, we know Hooch was in the warehouse
under three minutes.

25:58.640 --> 26:02.435
At a top speed of 12 miles per hour,

26:02.519 --> 26:05.021
stopping for the three documented pees,

26:05.105 --> 26:10.443
it would take Hooch two minutes
and 48 seconds to reach the painting,

26:10.527 --> 26:12.529
leaving him 12 seconds to damage it.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.697
Not a lot of time.

26:14.239 --> 26:15.865
Let's consider bite patterns.

26:18.285 --> 26:19.786
Speaks for itself.

26:19.869 --> 26:24.082
You see, Hooch shows no impulse
to bite the dog image.

26:24.165 --> 26:25.917
Not that one, not that guy,

26:26.668 --> 26:27.877
not that guy.

26:27.961 --> 26:31.423
Even when induced
with five ounces of peanut butter,

26:31.506 --> 26:33.466
both chunky and creamy,

26:33.550 --> 26:35.635
he simply licked the surface.

26:35.719 --> 26:38.763
In summary, Hooch neither had the time,

26:38.847 --> 26:42.517
nor the inclination to do this crime.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.604
I rest my case.

26:47.897 --> 26:50.442
Not how it works. But thank you for that.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.360
Let's talk to Mr. Stilts.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.988
So the dog had seen the painting
before you got to the warehouse?

26:55.071 --> 26:57.073
Yes. At the suspect's mansion.

26:57.157 --> 27:00.535
He barked aggressively at the Gadoise
on multiple occasions.

27:01.328 --> 27:03.538
I also saw him chew bubble wrap
at the mansion.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.749
And you found chewed bubble wrap
at the warehouse?

27:05.832 --> 27:07.167
That is correct. Yes.

27:08.001 --> 27:11.546
Yeah, the dog was running all over,
going wild. Having the time of his life.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.923
Peeing, drooling, basically running amok.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.091
Objection, conjecture.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.968
Again, just an interview,
not court.

27:17.052 --> 27:20.889
But he didn't see any of this.
There's no security footage, right?

27:20.972 --> 27:24.517
I mean, what if another animal did this?
A-- A rat? A raccoon? Perhaps a weasel?

27:24.601 --> 27:26.311
There are cameras at all the doors.

27:26.394 --> 27:28.647
Maybe the animal was already
inside the building, right?

27:28.730 --> 27:30.690
In the vents, or the rafters up above.

27:31.524 --> 27:33.068
It's a possibility.

27:33.151 --> 27:37.489
But forgetting all that and the timeline.
This is just not something Hooch would do.

27:37.572 --> 27:38.615
Ask anyone.

27:38.698 --> 27:42.285
That is exactly the kind of thing
that dog would do.

27:42.369 --> 27:44.829
I mean, I've personally seen him
push a room service cart

27:44.913 --> 27:46.873
down a flight of stairs into a fountain.

27:46.956 --> 27:49.125
Oh, and then we were tracking
a dangerous criminal,

27:49.209 --> 27:52.545
and he led the team into a pet store
where it stole a squeaky toy.

27:52.629 --> 27:56.424
And most recently, broke discipline
on a manhunt for a fugitive,

27:56.508 --> 27:59.010
which led me to be almost killed
by a booby trap.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.679
Objection. Sorry.

28:00.762 --> 28:03.306
But "almost killed"? H-He got poison oak.

28:03.390 --> 28:05.600
- Continue please, Deputy.
- Thank you very much.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.852
It has also destroyed
office snacks and pastries

28:07.936 --> 28:10.063
meant for federal
law enforcement officers.

28:11.147 --> 28:14.109
Uh, Hooch has messed around, sure.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.528
But, I mean, he's a sweetheart.

28:16.611 --> 28:18.988
You've never seen the dog
behave in an aggressive manner?

28:19.072 --> 28:24.661
Once, he barked at an FBI guy, who,
it actually turned out, was crooked.

28:24.744 --> 28:27.455
So, I mean,
I wouldn't call that aggressive.

28:27.539 --> 28:29.666
He's just doing his job, helping out.

28:29.749 --> 28:32.627
So, if the dog perceives something
like a painting to be a threat,

28:32.711 --> 28:33.962
he might attack it to help out?

28:34.045 --> 28:36.005
- Yeah, sure.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.259
Mm... Mm-mmm.

28:39.342 --> 28:42.762
No. Mm-mmm. He-- He would not...

28:43.638 --> 28:44.639
do that.

28:46.766 --> 28:48.560
Do you have some water?

28:48.643 --> 28:52.188
Did I witness Hooch chew his new leash?
Yeah. Yeah.

28:52.272 --> 28:55.775
And I remember thinking,
"What if I could chew my tie?"

28:59.988 --> 29:02.490
Do you know why he had a new leash?

29:03.116 --> 29:05.952
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Scott said
he chewed through the old one.

29:07.162 --> 29:10.915
Yeah, which I suspect you're gonna say
is a pattern he should've seen,

29:10.999 --> 29:14.544
to which I would say,
"Patterns are complex things, okay?"

29:14.627 --> 29:17.130
So, who can know?
You know, chaos theory tells--

29:17.213 --> 29:18.548
Thank you. That's enough.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.677
Hooch chewed up every award in my office.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.013
Every single one.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.893
So, what's the verdict?

29:29.976 --> 29:33.313
Disciplinary action for me,
and the chief has to tell the marshal

29:33.396 --> 29:36.316
that his pet K-9 project
crashed and burned.

29:36.399 --> 29:38.568
No. Aw.

29:38.651 --> 29:40.195
So, no more Hooch?

29:40.278 --> 29:43.031
Not unless a miracle occurs
before she submits that report.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.742
Yeah, I'd maybe ask Erica,

29:45.825 --> 29:47.118
but she's been so busy.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.079
Oh, right. Uh, yeah.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.999
So, about that, um...

29:53.082 --> 29:56.419
I maybe, kinda told Erica
to make herself less available.

29:56.503 --> 29:57.962
You told her not to talk to me?

29:59.214 --> 30:01.132
You were--
You were taking her for granted.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.343
Calling her at all hours,

30:03.426 --> 30:07.639
skipping sessions 'cause of "work"
or you and Miss Thing have opera tickets.

30:07.722 --> 30:10.308
So, I just told her to pull back a little,
and she did.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.769
So I'm sorry. But also, like, not.

30:12.852 --> 30:14.354
- Not?
- Not, no.

30:14.437 --> 30:17.690
Yeah, not, 'cause, like, dude. Come on.
You-- You can't do that.

30:19.150 --> 30:21.569
You're right. That was not good.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.030
But can you just
talk to her for me, please?

30:24.113 --> 30:27.325
Just tell her it's, like,
an emergency Hooch situation.

30:27.408 --> 30:30.578
Baxter, say bye-bye to doggy.
I need those phone records.

30:32.121 --> 30:33.248
Uh, please.

30:34.290 --> 30:35.458
What?

30:35.542 --> 30:37.961
Thanks for the help in there.
Really inspiring teamwork.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.213
Shouldn't have made fun
of my poison oak, dude.

30:41.422 --> 30:42.924
Duty calls.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.093
Sorry,
but you gotta handle this one yourself.

30:51.266 --> 30:53.393
- I was irresponsible.

30:53.476 --> 30:56.688
More than irresponsible.
I was a bad friend.

30:56.771 --> 31:00.233
I took you for granted, and--
and I'm really sorry.

31:01.025 --> 31:04.487
But right now, I'm in real trouble
and so is Hooch.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.447
And the fact is...

31:08.658 --> 31:09.909
I really need you.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.412
I'm confused. What do you want me to do?

31:12.495 --> 31:13.997
I'm trying to get an apology to Erica.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.791
I need her help with something,
but I can't get ahold of her,

31:16.875 --> 31:18.793
so I'm just asking if you see her...

31:18.877 --> 31:21.713
Scott. I'm not an answering machine, okay?
I'm a dog trainer.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.965
- Dog trainer. Right, yes, I forgot.
- Right.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.341
- Can you--
- Yeah.

31:25.425 --> 31:29.387
You know, and by the way, those are
way too many words to memorize.

31:29.470 --> 31:31.055
Have you tried calling her?

31:31.139 --> 31:31.973
Yeah.

31:32.056 --> 31:34.142
Yes, but she's busy, and I can't...

31:36.811 --> 31:39.397
This was a mistake. Just forget it. Sorry.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.107
Just tell her I stopped by.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.358
Yeah.

31:42.442 --> 31:43.443
Thanks.

31:47.363 --> 31:48.865
Man, you believe this guy?

31:50.074 --> 31:51.826
Yes. I believe him.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.205
- Hey, Laura. What's up?
<i>Nothing is up.</i>

31:56.289 --> 31:59.542
Everything is, in fact, down,
as in a bad, no-good day.

31:59.626 --> 32:03.087
Yeah. Well, join the club.
Everything's falling apart over here too.

32:03.171 --> 32:05.256
Scott, am I crazy?

32:05.340 --> 32:08.092
I mean, I didn't used to think so,
but now I'm just wondering

32:08.176 --> 32:11.679
if this whole investigation is nothing,
and I'm crazy.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.098
Laura, is everything okay?

32:14.182 --> 32:16.434
No,
that Walton guy came in here yesterday.

32:16.517 --> 32:19.020
And at first, I was like,
"Oh, no, scary, bad man,"

32:19.103 --> 32:20.939
but he was nice.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.316
He was friends with Dad and Hooch.

32:23.399 --> 32:26.194
Well, yeah.
Laura, I-I tried to tell you that. I--

32:26.277 --> 32:30.657
Am I making all of this up
just so I can solve Dad's last big case

32:30.740 --> 32:33.409
because I miss Dad
and I didn't know what else to do?

32:34.202 --> 32:36.329
Laura, I don't know. I--

32:36.412 --> 32:37.789
Is it like that with everything?

32:37.872 --> 32:41.084
Pass the vet tech exam.
Get your life together. Solve the case.

32:41.167 --> 32:45.004
Is this all so I can just fool myself
into believing that I'm doing something

32:45.088 --> 32:50.259
and I'm not just some sad sack
who hung around town and did nothing?

32:52.845 --> 32:54.097
Am I a cliché?

32:57.767 --> 33:00.144
Scott, this is the part
where you argue with me and you say,

33:00.228 --> 33:01.938
<i>"No, Laura. You're amazing.
You're doing great."</i>

33:02.021 --> 33:06.818
Sorry. Sorry, Laura.
I... I got a lot going on too.

33:06.901 --> 33:08.027
Of course. Sorry.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.947
Anyway, we should probably
apologize to Walton,

33:11.030 --> 33:12.782
maybe bring him some cookies or something.

33:12.865 --> 33:16.119
Sure. Great. Yeah. Just let me know when.

33:16.202 --> 33:17.620
Yeah. Thanks, Scott.

33:21.541 --> 33:23.042
Oh, Ralph.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.922
Anyway, that's the walking schedule.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.925
Unless you see him pacing around
in like a-- like, a certain way,

33:31.009 --> 33:33.094
then you just wanna take him out
or let him out back.

33:33.177 --> 33:34.595
This is just for his dinner?

33:34.679 --> 33:36.264
Monday, Wednesday, Friday dinner.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.725
- The other dinner's on page two.
- Other dinner?

33:38.808 --> 33:41.602
Yeah, you can reference it. Do--
Yeah, are you referencing?

33:41.686 --> 33:44.313
We're alternating between high-protein
and organic fiber.

33:44.397 --> 33:47.984
Kibble is just-- It's essential
in managing his gas issues.

33:48.067 --> 33:49.318
Gas issues?

33:49.402 --> 33:50.528
You get used to it.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.196
- Okay.
- Yeah.

33:52.280 --> 33:56.409
Anyway, uh, most days
it's just half-cup protein, quarter fiber

33:56.492 --> 33:59.162
and then an additional quarter-cup
protein plus egg powder

33:59.245 --> 34:00.955
- once he's finished the initial mix.
- Protein.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.875
But don't mix the mixes.
The other days it's just reverse.

34:03.958 --> 34:07.837
Except no egg powder, right?
And salmon, not beef.

34:07.920 --> 34:11.507
Uh, the breakfast instructions should be
pretty clear. Do they seem clear?

34:11.591 --> 34:13.051
Uh, dude, is this a joke?

34:15.344 --> 34:17.263
Doug, this-- This might not be a fit.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.309
Is it too complicated?

34:21.392 --> 34:22.935
Oh, no. No, no, no.

34:23.019 --> 34:26.981
I used to sit for a good, good boy
who had every issue in the book.

34:27.065 --> 34:31.069
You know, like, weird food and pills and--
This is nothing.

34:31.152 --> 34:34.030
This is gonna be easy. Totally easy.
Yeah, yeah. 'Cause I love dogs.

34:34.113 --> 34:36.365
I love dogs. And they love me.

34:36.449 --> 34:38.409
Right, Hoochie? Who's a good boy?

34:38.493 --> 34:39.827
Oh, such a good boy. Such a--

34:39.911 --> 34:42.538
- Oh, my God!

34:42.622 --> 34:43.706
- Wow.

34:43.790 --> 34:45.625
- Oh, my God! My nose!
- You are a bleeder.

34:45.708 --> 34:48.294
Uh, I'm not really good with blood.

34:48.377 --> 34:49.504
Just keep it-- Keep it back.

34:49.587 --> 34:51.964
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- You know what? Forward.

34:52.048 --> 34:53.257
Back is worse. Back is worse.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.801
Well, I need something, anything.

34:54.884 --> 34:57.011
Help me! Get me something, anything!

35:02.850 --> 35:03.851
Any questions?

35:03.935 --> 35:05.103
Looks fine.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.313
I've managed worse.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.108
Impressive. What's your secret?

35:10.191 --> 35:12.276
The secret is I don't get attached.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.863
Keep my distance. They keep theirs.
And everyone gets along.

35:16.864 --> 35:20.243
- So, is it Gooch or Goop?

35:20.326 --> 35:21.327
Erica.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.412
Thought it was a boy dog.

35:26.999 --> 35:28.000
Hey.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.378
Yes. Hi, Scott.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.880
I am calling about Hooch.

35:32.964 --> 35:35.091
Curtis had mentioned
there might be a problem,

35:35.174 --> 35:37.468
and he heard you talking
to Guy about some--

35:37.552 --> 35:40.972
Yes, Erica. I-- I'm so sorry. I...

35:42.598 --> 35:46.144
<i>I took you for granted.
You're not my dog butler. You're--</i>

35:47.228 --> 35:53.651
I value your help and your friendship
and just you in general.

35:53.734 --> 35:57.446
<i>And I have been selfish and a jerk.</i>

35:58.447 --> 36:00.199
And I really apologize.

36:04.370 --> 36:05.830
Oh, um...

36:07.331 --> 36:08.416
Thank you.

36:08.499 --> 36:10.084
Um...

36:10.168 --> 36:11.961
What's going on exactly?

36:12.712 --> 36:15.673
Hooch is in trouble. So am I.

36:15.756 --> 36:20.678
They think he ate a painting.
I know he didn't, but I can't prove it.

36:20.761 --> 36:24.098
<i>And it's not just Hooch with a problem.
Internal Affairs is blaming me.</i>

36:24.182 --> 36:25.558
<i>And if I can't prove he's innocent,</i>

36:25.641 --> 36:28.603
<i>I'm gonna wind up guarding courthouse
parking lots for the rest of my life.</i>

36:28.686 --> 36:30.021
I'm getting off of work soon.

36:30.104 --> 36:32.481
I could just come over
and help you figure it out.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.400
Yes. Great.

36:34.483 --> 36:37.486
<i>Yes. I-- Come right over.</i>

36:37.570 --> 36:38.779
Angel, come on.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.371
So is there anything else?

36:47.455 --> 36:48.539
Hi.

36:49.457 --> 36:51.209
Turns out I might not need anyone.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.295
So, uh,
looks like we'll be keeping our distance.

36:57.173 --> 36:58.758
These are great. You made these?

36:58.841 --> 37:00.134
- Yeah. Uh.
- Wow.

37:00.218 --> 37:02.803
I'm pretty slick with a PowerPoint, and--

37:02.887 --> 37:04.222
It's impressive.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.265
What's sticking out to me is, um...

37:09.310 --> 37:10.978
uh, the-- the peeing.

37:11.062 --> 37:13.606
The peeing. That's Hooch's favorite hobby.

37:13.689 --> 37:17.026
Right, but peeing isn't a hobby for dogs.

37:17.109 --> 37:20.154
They're marking their territory, right?
Communicating with each other.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.114
So if Hooch was peeing this much,

37:22.198 --> 37:25.660
that tells me there was another dog
there at some point.

37:26.994 --> 37:29.914
- Wha-- That would explain everything.
- Right?

37:29.997 --> 37:32.458
Wait, but it's not like I can
just dust for paw prints

37:32.541 --> 37:34.669
and run it
through the federal dog database.

37:34.752 --> 37:35.753
Right.

37:37.922 --> 37:40.341
Only, yeah, there is something.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.926
- Do you have a hand mirror?
- Yeah.

37:42.009 --> 37:44.845
Okay. And maybe some baby powder and tape.

37:44.929 --> 37:45.972
- Clear tape.
- Yeah.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.431
- I have an idea.
Okay.

37:47.515 --> 37:50.268
- Good boy, Hooch. Good boy.
- Okay, buddy.

37:50.851 --> 37:51.852
Got it.

37:51.936 --> 37:53.771
- Okay. Now the powder.
- Okay.

37:53.854 --> 37:56.941
It's a little-known fact that all dogs
have these tiny lines

37:57.024 --> 37:59.151
and wrinkles on their nose
that are unique to each dog,

37:59.235 --> 38:00.569
like fingerprints.

38:01.529 --> 38:02.530
Perfect.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.950
- The tape. Here, you hold that.
- Yeah.

38:17.628 --> 38:19.630
- There.
- Wow.

38:19.714 --> 38:23.175
Perfect. Okay, now you need
to get the print from the painting,

38:23.259 --> 38:25.636
and if they don't match,
Hooch is innocent.

38:25.720 --> 38:28.556
Right. I'll figure something out.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.392
- It's gonna be okay. I promise.

38:31.475 --> 38:32.852
Yeah, it's gonna be okay.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.828
Sorry, bud. You stay here.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.080
You're not exactly super popular in there.

38:56.417 --> 38:57.710
There you go.

39:08.554 --> 39:10.931
Mr. Marling, Deputy Turner.

39:11.015 --> 39:14.435
Um, I'm sorry to bother you. I just need
to check that painting real quick.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.644
I'm just closing up.

39:15.728 --> 39:16.896
I, uh...

39:16.979 --> 39:19.815
I just need a few more details
for the disciplinary report.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.484
Chief was pretty insistent.

39:22.234 --> 39:23.652
Fine. Five minutes.

39:24.570 --> 39:26.489
Don't touch anything.

39:28.407 --> 39:29.700
Don't pee on anything!

39:29.784 --> 39:30.785
Got it.

39:31.285 --> 39:33.829
Where is this thing?

39:37.708 --> 39:40.169
Come on. Come on. Come on.

39:43.672 --> 39:46.258
If I were an ugly painting,
where would I be?

39:51.180 --> 39:52.181
Oh, yeah.

40:10.491 --> 40:11.492
Bingo.

40:33.556 --> 40:36.183
That's not it. It wasn't Hooch.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.656
Low priority. Bag and tag.

40:50.739 --> 40:52.241
Walk in the park.
- Let's do it.

40:52.324 --> 40:53.409
- Yeah.
- Brad, lead the way.

40:53.492 --> 40:55.119
Dogs have snout prints?

40:55.202 --> 40:58.164
They're like fingerprints, each unique,
and Hooch is innocent.

40:58.247 --> 40:59.290
I did not know that.

40:59.373 --> 41:01.208
- I was always more of a cat guy.
- We're rolling!

41:01.292 --> 41:05.212
<i>That's not all. I found this empty
space inside the painting that looked new.</i>

41:05.296 --> 41:07.715
Like, what if Mario had drugs
stashed in there, right?

41:07.798 --> 41:09.675
<i>That would explain why
Hooch was barking at it.</i>

41:09.758 --> 41:10.593
Interesting.

41:10.676 --> 41:12.887
It's more than interesting, bro. I--

41:12.970 --> 41:14.930
<i>We gotta talk to the manager
and see who else had access.</i>

41:15.014 --> 41:18.058
I was hoping maybe you could help
since I'm on leave and whatnot.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.351
<i>We got a runner!</i>

41:19.435 --> 41:21.812
Uh, I'm in the middle of a thing.
Can it wait till tomorrow?

41:21.896 --> 41:23.606
The disciplinary report goes out tomorrow.

41:23.689 --> 41:25.441
<i>I'm kinda busy right now, Scott.</i>

41:25.524 --> 41:26.901
All right. I'll call you back.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.947
Well, that was more than five minutes.

41:32.531 --> 41:33.824
Yeah, I'm gonna need a few more.

41:33.908 --> 41:36.744
I need to see everyone who was
in this building the last two days.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.287
Now? I thought you were suspended.

41:38.370 --> 41:42.666
Yeah, for something Hooch didn't do.
I have proof. Another dog was here.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.502
I-I-I think it was a drug-sniffing dog.

41:44.585 --> 41:47.254
I think there was someone
looking for drugs Mario stashed,

41:47.338 --> 41:49.548
- like an accomplice or somebody.

41:50.257 --> 41:51.675
Answer that and you're dead.

41:52.343 --> 41:53.594
Put it down.

41:55.554 --> 41:56.972
Whoa.

41:57.556 --> 41:59.016
Let's talk for a second.

41:59.099 --> 42:01.602
No. Shut up! Shut up and sit down.

42:02.686 --> 42:04.230
- Okay. All right.
- Okay.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.694
We can talk for a second, right?
You move over there.

42:11.695 --> 42:14.114
<i>...forecast, showers...</i>

42:16.367 --> 42:18.410
What do you think you're doing?

42:24.166 --> 42:25.543
Slide it over.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.712
Stephen, think about what you're doing.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.464
Cuff yourself to the chair. Yeah.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.883
You're gonna make this
so much worse for yourself.

42:33.926 --> 42:36.303
- The planning, the sneaking around...

42:36.387 --> 42:38.097
And then you bring your dog into work!

42:40.599 --> 42:42.101
Listen to me.

42:42.184 --> 42:43.936
If Mario's behind this,

42:44.019 --> 42:46.605
if he threatened you,
you know we can make a deal, right?

42:48.315 --> 42:51.777
He didn't threaten me. He paid me.
I got the drug-sniffing dog.

42:51.860 --> 42:53.404
It was the perfect way to get the drugs

42:53.487 --> 42:55.322
after you showed up
with that ridiculous beast.

42:55.406 --> 42:58.909
If something happens to me,
there's no way you get away with this.

42:58.993 --> 43:02.413
It seems to me that if you disappeared,

43:02.496 --> 43:05.207
your friends are gonna blame
the drug dealer you just busted

43:05.291 --> 43:06.625
and not some warehouse manager.

43:06.709 --> 43:10.045
- I better get this done quickly.
- No, no! You're gonna shoot me here?

43:10.129 --> 43:13.716
The blood, like, it'll go everywhere.
They'll catch you in seconds.

43:26.604 --> 43:28.147
Golf club's gonna hurt a lot more.

43:28.230 --> 43:30.065
Stephen, stop! Stephen!

43:30.149 --> 43:31.900
Don't do it! No! No!

44:02.056 --> 44:03.390
Hi there!

44:04.058 --> 44:05.976
I'm, uh, looking for Deputy Turner.

44:06.060 --> 44:07.811
Uh, yeah. Well, he was here.

44:07.895 --> 44:13.067
Uh, but he and the dog went off
to check the perimeter for something.

44:13.150 --> 44:14.151
- Something?
- Yeah.

44:14.234 --> 44:16.195
Well, did he say what it was?

44:16.278 --> 44:17.279
No.

44:17.363 --> 44:19.990
Well, I have a dinner reservation,
so I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.534
- Okay, I'm gonna go look around for Scott.
- Yeah.

44:24.953 --> 44:26.455
Freeze! Hands!

44:26.538 --> 44:28.082
- X, stop him!
- Don't move!

44:30.542 --> 44:32.586
I hope that reservation
wasn't hard to get,

44:32.670 --> 44:34.254
'cause I think
you're gonna miss that dinner.

44:36.006 --> 44:37.257
Aw.

44:37.341 --> 44:42.304
Good boy, Hooch. Good boy.
I love you. I love you, bud.

44:47.810 --> 44:49.478
We found the dog at Marling's house.

44:49.561 --> 44:51.772
She was an ATF drug-training dropout.

44:51.855 --> 44:53.107
So we're gonna adopt her,

44:53.190 --> 44:55.025
finish her training
and put her back to work.

44:55.109 --> 44:58.362
Wilson. How long of a confession
did you get out of this guy?

44:58.404 --> 45:01.240
Guy was speaking his truth.
Who am I to stop him?

45:01.323 --> 45:04.243
He was responsible for tons of assets
that went missing.

45:04.326 --> 45:08.330
I got to fill in
a lot of empty spreadsheet cells.

45:08.872 --> 45:10.666
- Then we're all settled.
- Settled?

45:11.709 --> 45:14.795
Mr. Turner's negligent behavior
is not settled.

45:14.878 --> 45:17.506
And that dog remains a disaster
waiting to happen.

45:17.589 --> 45:19.091
This is all in my report.

45:19.174 --> 45:23.262
Well, what's in my report
is that this K-9 saved a deputy's life

45:23.345 --> 45:25.764
and aided in the recovery
of how much stolen goods?

45:25.848 --> 45:27.975
Uh, about 1.2 million...

45:28.934 --> 45:30.728
- so far.
So far.

45:30.811 --> 45:31.895
I'm sorry. How much?

45:31.979 --> 45:33.230
1.2 million.

45:33.313 --> 45:34.940
It's incredible.
- It's a lot of money to me.

45:35.023 --> 45:37.109
- More money, more problems.
- Should we do a hand raise for--

45:37.192 --> 45:38.193
Yeah, more-- It's a lot.

45:38.277 --> 45:40.237
Okay, if that's how it is.

45:40.320 --> 45:42.239
Well, it's not how it isn't. So...

45:43.741 --> 45:45.868
Thank you so much, Susan.
Thank you.

45:45.951 --> 45:48.662
Let me know what the total is.
Thanks so much for your hard work.

45:48.746 --> 45:49.747
My pleasure.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.459
Sir, I ju-- I can't thank you enough.

45:53.542 --> 45:56.462
And just rest assured, we are totally
focused on Hooch's training.

45:56.545 --> 45:58.589
- He's getting better every day.

45:59.923 --> 46:00.924
Most days.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.177
Most days.

46:03.260 --> 46:04.261
Hooch.

46:05.637 --> 46:06.597
Thank you.

46:08.098 --> 46:11.852
Uh, listen, Erica,
you really saved me here and Hooch.

46:11.935 --> 46:13.979
I just wanted to say I'm so sorry again.

46:14.062 --> 46:16.774
Actually, I wanted to apologize to you.

46:16.857 --> 46:18.442
- Really? Me? Why?
- Yeah.

46:18.525 --> 46:21.069
I wasn't there
when you and Hooch needed me,

46:21.153 --> 46:25.491
and I just let some of my own,
like, stuff get in the way.

46:25.574 --> 46:29.161
No, no. Forget it. You were there, okay?
You saved me and Hooch.

46:29.244 --> 46:30.412
Well, I'm sorry about Guy.

46:30.496 --> 46:32.456
- That I can't forgive you for.

46:32.539 --> 46:34.833
No, no. Hey, listen.
He taught Hooch how to climb stuff.

46:34.917 --> 46:38.003
If it wasn't for him, I would've been
on the wrong end of a golf club.

46:38.086 --> 46:40.172
I kinda was on the wrong end
of a golf club.

46:40.255 --> 46:42.966
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah. Beat to death.

46:43.592 --> 46:46.970
Anyways, I was hoping that I could pick up
Hooch's training again.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.139
But if you wanna stay with Guy,
I get that.

46:49.223 --> 46:51.225
No, you're better. You're way better.

46:51.308 --> 46:54.186
And I promise I won't miss
a single session this time.

46:54.269 --> 46:56.230
So, friends again?

46:58.565 --> 46:59.566
Friends.

47:00.526 --> 47:02.820
- Come here. Come on. Ah.
- Of course. Okay. Okay.

47:20.003 --> 47:22.256
Thanks for coming with me to do this.

47:22.339 --> 47:25.050
I feel bad for how we treated Walton.
I just wanna make things right.

47:25.133 --> 47:28.428
We? You're the one who accused him
of smuggling explosives.

47:28.512 --> 47:30.055
Hey! You broke into his warehouse.

47:30.138 --> 47:31.849
Only after you insisted.

47:32.432 --> 47:33.684
- Yeah.
- Never mind.

47:35.018 --> 47:36.395
- Excuse me.
- Oh, hi.

47:36.478 --> 47:38.480
Uh, we're looking for Walton.

47:39.898 --> 47:42.234
Walton! Some folks here to see you!

47:46.613 --> 47:47.614
Thanks, Karl.

47:50.409 --> 47:51.326
Hi.

47:51.410 --> 47:52.619
Oh, hi.

47:52.703 --> 47:56.331
Uh, we just came by to say hello
and sorry for the misunderstanding.

47:56.415 --> 47:57.875
- We brought cookies.

47:57.958 --> 47:59.376
Well, that's not necessary,

47:59.459 --> 48:02.379
but I never say no
to a fresh-baked cookie.

48:02.462 --> 48:04.756
Oh, I'm so glad. I made them myself.

48:04.840 --> 48:08.760
Last time I sort of had a fire issue,
but this time around I really--

48:08.844 --> 48:10.470
- Anyway, I think I executed well.

48:10.554 --> 48:11.513
- Hooch, stop!
- Hey, hey!

48:11.597 --> 48:14.182
- Sorry! Oh, my gosh! So sorry.
- Easy. Easy. What's his problem?

48:14.266 --> 48:15.517
Stop, okay?

48:16.518 --> 48:18.186
Hooch, hey. Come on. No.

48:18.270 --> 48:20.439
Let's do this another time. Sorry.

48:20.522 --> 48:22.190
Maybe that's a good idea.

48:22.274 --> 48:24.526
- Hey. Hey.

48:24.610 --> 48:25.736
Hey.

48:25.819 --> 48:27.696
Hey, what the hell
was that all about, huh?

48:28.322 --> 48:29.656
What's wrong? What got into you?

48:31.950 --> 48:33.785
- Scott.
- What?

48:33.869 --> 48:35.454
Hooch definitely knew that man.

48:35.537 --> 48:38.707
- Shh.
- They weren't friends. He hated him.

48:38.790 --> 48:40.918
Laura, are we really doing this again?

48:41.001 --> 48:43.462
Look me in the eyes right now
and tell me that you believe

48:43.545 --> 48:47.257
that that man that Hooch just
freaked out at was a friend of Dad's.

48:48.675 --> 48:51.011
All right. Yeah. Yeah, he's lying.

48:51.094 --> 48:52.596
- Yeah.
- But about what?

48:52.679 --> 48:55.599
And why? What does it all mean?

48:55.682 --> 48:57.059
We have no evidence, Laura.

48:57.142 --> 48:59.311
Hooch is all the evidence I need.
Let's go.
