WEBVTT

00:06.377 --> 00:11.642
Why is the whole school empty?
And where's Mrs. Mills?

00:11.642 --> 00:14.685
There's only one explanation.
We're the last survivors
of a zombie attack.

00:18.219 --> 00:21.152
There's no such
thing as zombies.

00:21.152 --> 00:22.793
(ALL SCREAMING)

00:26.057 --> 00:29.360
Look how its rotting flesh
barely hangs onto its
decomposed body!

00:32.031 --> 00:33.804
And those eyes.
Those cold, dead eyes.

00:36.367 --> 00:39.710
(GRUNTING)

00:39.710 --> 00:43.774
Like the rest of your class,
Mrs. Mills got food poisoning
from the cafeteria.

00:43.774 --> 00:48.048
Apparently, buying a truck
full of tuna fish
for twelve dollars

00:48.048 --> 00:49.650
was not as good
a deal as I thought.

00:52.383 --> 00:57.528
I knew to stay away from that
lunch special. Fish are not
supposed to have feet.

00:57.528 --> 01:01.462
Anyway, instead of class,
we will be having a
scavenger hunt

01:01.462 --> 01:04.165
and the winning
team gets a week off school!

01:04.165 --> 01:06.197
(ALL CHEERING)

01:06.197 --> 01:10.271
Okay, Lexi and Chyna,
you two have never
had much of a rivalry,

01:12.443 --> 01:15.476
so to keep things
friendly, why don't you
be team captains?

01:17.508 --> 01:18.379
Chyna, you pick first.

01:18.379 --> 01:19.610
Okay.

01:19.610 --> 01:23.083
Me! Pick me! Over here!

01:23.083 --> 01:25.616
I want to be fair
about this, so,

01:25.616 --> 01:30.421
my mother told me to
pick the very best one
and you are it.

01:32.223 --> 01:35.396
If I were stopping right now

01:35.396 --> 01:39.600
but I am going to keep going
until I land on Olive.

01:40.471 --> 01:40.831
Doyle.

01:43.674 --> 01:44.875
Lexi, your turn.

01:45.736 --> 01:49.109
Me! Pick me! Over here!

01:49.109 --> 01:52.643
All right, I'm going to pick
someone who's loyal,
will do everything I say,

01:52.643 --> 01:56.116
and has pretty hair.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.389
Thank you. I washed it
three days ago.

01:59.790 --> 02:03.324
Not you. Paisley.

02:03.324 --> 02:08.429
Yay! Now for this scavenger
hunt, I should tell you that I
do not have a hunting license.

02:12.563 --> 02:16.136
Okay, so Chyna picks me,
and you get Cameron.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.710
What? Cameron? No!

02:19.710 --> 02:22.713
Even if one of the things
on the list we had to find
was Cameron,

02:22.713 --> 02:24.375
we wouldn't want Cameron.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.581
Sorry, Fletcher,
but I'm picking my brother.

02:30.581 --> 02:34.485
Chyna, can we have a quick
team meeting, in private?

02:34.485 --> 02:35.286
(FORCED GIGGLING)
 Just real quick, come on.

02:38.889 --> 02:42.863
(YELLING) Cameron? You picked
that idiot, Cameron?

02:42.863 --> 02:46.867
Look, he may not seem
school smart, but he's
street smart. I'll show you.

02:48.299 --> 02:48.939
Cameron, what street
do we live on?

02:51.772 --> 02:52.803
Wait! I know this...

02:56.347 --> 02:58.249
See? He's useless.
Just a minute ago

02:58.249 --> 02:59.650
he believed we were
under attack by zombies!

03:03.284 --> 03:04.885

unscramble these letters.

04:22.633 --> 04:24.935
It's a trick. Those letters
aren't scrambled at all.

04:26.967 --> 04:27.598
This is gonna be a long day.

04:31.902 --> 04:34.975
Should have
had the fish.

04:34.975 --> 04:41.552
Boom. Solved it.
"White mouse." So obvious.
What else could it be?

04:41.552 --> 04:44.415
Got it! "Mwite house!"

04:46.857 --> 04:49.690

05:00.300 --> 05:02.002
Okay, so I figured out
a way to get a white mouse.

05:03.334 --> 05:04.335
All right.

05:14.084 --> 05:16.517
The pied piper's music
attracted rats, not mice.

05:16.517 --> 05:18.819
And, more importantly,
he was make-believe.

05:20.351 --> 05:22.653
I know, but...

05:22.653 --> 05:24.755
Now we'll have enough money
to go to a pet store
and buy a mouse.

05:26.527 --> 05:28.959
Thank you.
Thank you.

05:29.700 --> 05:30.761
Ooh!

05:30.761 --> 05:32.933
Thank you.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.965
CAMERON: I already
went and bought
the last mouse.

05:34.965 --> 05:39.069
Unfortunately, it was just
fed to this boa constrictor.

05:43.444 --> 05:49.550
No problem. We just need to
figure out how to do the
Heimlich maneuver on a snake.

05:49.550 --> 05:52.823
Actually, I think he's doing
the Heimlich maneuver on me.

05:52.823 --> 05:57.988
Aww, he's hugging you.
That or he's trying to
devour you whole.

05:57.988 --> 05:59.460
Either way,
it's adorable!

05:59.990 --> 06:01.632
Help me.

06:01.632 --> 06:03.564
Okay. I got this.

06:10.901 --> 06:13.544
That's not how you charm
a snake. You charm
a snake like this.

All right, we need a
white mouse and failure
is not an option.

06:29.520 --> 06:33.393
Which means you two need
to shape up! You!
Stomach in, chest out!

06:33.393 --> 06:37.798
You! Stomach out, chest in!

figure on the team.

Don't worry.
We'll be the victors!

06:42.573 --> 06:44.675
We have to change our names?

06:46.677 --> 06:48.809
Would you just let him talk?

06:48.809 --> 06:51.411
I'm sorry. Victor,
you were saying?

06:54.044 --> 06:55.616
I have designed a
Rube Goldberg trap

06:55.616 --> 06:56.917
in the hallway
to catch a mouse.

07:00.090 --> 07:01.592
The mouse
takes the cheese,

07:01.592 --> 07:04.154
which is tied to a pin,
which pops a balloon,

07:04.154 --> 07:06.927
scaring a fat lady,
causing her to shriek,
which shatters a glass vase,

07:06.927 --> 07:08.759
which sends a cat
running, which starts
a chain saw,

07:08.759 --> 07:09.960
which cuts through a crate,
which releases the
flock of ducks,

07:09.960 --> 07:12.463
which drops a metal box
onto the mouse.

That's Rube Goldberg.

07:41.962 --> 07:45.666

up again. We just have
to find those ducks.

07:45.666 --> 07:46.667
(DUCKS QUACKING)

07:51.041 --> 07:52.002
Found them.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.766
We did it! We found
a white mouse!

08:15.766 --> 08:19.700
Rube Goldberg lent it
to me. He's in my
Internet shopping class.

08:21.572 --> 08:21.872
It's called computer science.

08:24.535 --> 08:28.639

the white computer mouse.

won the first round!

Yeah, well it's not over
until the fat lady sings.

08:46.757 --> 08:48.729
Don't you dare!

09:00.711 --> 09:04.114
SKIDMORE: For your next clue,
finish the rhyme
in this riddle.

09:04.114 --> 09:09.019

darn smart, so try
to find me Edison's last..."

See, I'm a songwriter.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.889
And if there's anything
I know, it's rhymes.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.907
Okay, well, we can
go ahead and skip "fart,"

09:36.907 --> 09:40.580
because it's clearly not
"Edison's last fart."

09:40.580 --> 09:43.854
Edison's last fart it is!
You are correct!

09:43.854 --> 09:46.717
What? That makes no sense.

09:46.717 --> 09:48.889
Actually, it does.

09:48.889 --> 09:52.763
On Edison's death bed,
his last breath was collected
into a test tube,

09:52.763 --> 09:55.295
which is currently
on display at
the Henry Ford Museum

09:55.295 --> 09:58.328
in Dearborn, Michigan.
I guess they also
collected his last fart.

09:58.328 --> 10:02.132
Someday, I hope
to be treated with the same
honor and reverence.

10:09.379 --> 10:12.683

out to be a bad idea.

but we need Thomas Edison's...

ordered it online.

for our fart.

11:01.962 --> 11:03.864

That's not fair!

11:06.967 --> 11:09.139
Sorry, Chyna, I'd like
to help you, but now
they're throwing around

11:09.139 --> 11:09.900
legal terms like "dibs."

11:12.302 --> 11:15.145
That's ours!

Chyna, how can you
stand these fumes?

11:45.836 --> 11:47.808
I've shared a bathroom with
Cameron my whole life.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.980
Compared to that,
this smells like
a warm batch of cookies.

11:49.980 --> 11:51.141
Come on!

11:58.919 --> 12:02.352
Ah. The smell of genius.

12:05.756 --> 12:08.959
Well, it's actually
an improvement on
your usual perfume.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.863
Looks like we're tied.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.104
Not for long.

12:19.039 --> 12:23.113
I didn't say "a Giants hat."
I said "a giant's hat."

A giraffe! It's my dad's.
He won it in a giraffle.

12:57.007 --> 12:59.880
I didn't say I wanted
a statue of a giraffe.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.511
Well, what were we
supposed to do,
get a real giraffe?

13:01.511 --> 13:05.215
PAISLEY: I'm sorry, guys.
I couldn't find a giraffe.

13:05.215 --> 13:09.289
And I rode all over town
looking for one on my
long-necked horse.

13:17.527 --> 13:19.329
Hey!

13:27.037 --> 13:32.282
For the next round,
get the autograph of my
favorite filmmaker.

13:32.282 --> 13:33.884
As a clue, I've
recreated a scene from
one of his movies.

13:41.992 --> 13:46.426
Quick! Who directed
 The Old Hag in
a Gold Bikini?

13:46.426 --> 13:53.163
I'm Princess Leia!
In George Lucas's Star Wars:
Return of the Jedi.

13:53.163 --> 13:55.005
I think I know why the
Jedi left in the first place.

14:03.874 --> 14:06.376
Okay, so George Lucas lives
just north of the city.

14:06.376 --> 14:08.118
Cameron, you have the map.

14:08.118 --> 14:08.949
How far are we from
Skywalker Ranch?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.981
About two inches.

14:16.626 --> 14:18.188
(PANTING) Okay.

14:18.188 --> 14:19.029
You think this is
the right place?

14:19.029 --> 14:19.990
(GATE BUZZING)

14:19.990 --> 14:22.963
Well, the mailbox did say

14:22.963 --> 14:26.196
"George Lucas Presents:
A George Lucas Production
of George Lucas' House" so...

14:35.275 --> 14:37.307
(BEEPING)

14:37.307 --> 14:41.982
Wow, it's the real R2-D2!
If you were one-fiftieth
your size

14:41.982 --> 14:46.186
and still in the original
packaging, you'd be worth
like, 35 dollars!

14:49.189 --> 14:51.461
Wow.

14:51.461 --> 14:52.963
I don't understand a word
he's saying, and I speak
57 languages.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.897
Fifty-seven is nothing,
my little blonde humanoid.

14:59.669 --> 15:02.672
I am fluent in over
six million forms
of communication.

15:02.672 --> 15:06.136
Including street slang.
So yo, step off, fool!

15:08.308 --> 15:10.010
C-3PO! You're here, too?

15:10.010 --> 15:12.282
Well, of course.
We work here.

15:12.282 --> 15:16.386
Master Lucas is very loyal.
Once you work for him,
you're employed for life.

15:16.386 --> 15:19.489
Lord Vader is his
head of security.
Boba Fett tends the garden.

15:19.489 --> 15:21.021
And Chewbacca cleans the pool.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.955
(CHEWBACCA GROANING)

15:24.955 --> 15:28.698
Oh stop complaining!
It's your fur that
keeps clogging the filter!

15:29.659 --> 15:30.660
(BEEPING)

15:33.203 --> 15:39.209
Look, Mr. PO, we really need
George Lucas' autograph

15:39.209 --> 15:43.373
before this girl Lexi
from school gets it.
Unless she already has it.

15:43.373 --> 15:46.276
(BEEPING)

15:46.276 --> 15:48.018
R2 says he might
be able to help.

15:52.582 --> 15:56.326
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.562
Oops, R2, you're playing
the wrong image.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.537
Last time we were at Hippo's,
I remember seeing some
 Star Wars memorabilia

16:07.537 --> 16:09.639
signed by George Lucas

16:09.639 --> 16:11.171
right before
I went fart-blind.

16:18.148 --> 16:22.212
Hey, guys! Welcome to my
delicious apple store,

16:22.212 --> 16:24.554
the place for all your
apple needs!

16:24.554 --> 16:27.517
Can I interest you in
a dual core processor?

16:27.517 --> 16:28.988
It cores two apples
at the same time.

16:31.761 --> 16:34.124
What happened to all
the scavenger hunt stuff?

16:34.124 --> 16:36.496
Turns out Grandma
was just napping.

16:36.496 --> 16:40.700
Besides, scavenger hunts
are very out right now.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.333
And apparently, people are
lining up for apple products.

16:43.333 --> 16:46.106
Although for some reason,
business here is very slow.

16:49.509 --> 16:53.783
Finally! Every apple store
I go to sells computers.
And they taste awful!

16:58.148 --> 17:00.490
Great. There's no way we're
going to win now.

17:00.490 --> 17:03.353
(IN BRITISH ACCENT)
I find your lack
of faith disturbing.

17:04.723 --> 17:05.724
(CHOKING)

17:07.797 --> 17:10.099
How are you doing that?

17:13.532 --> 17:16.165
Oh, I was just choking on
this piece of apple.

17:22.242 --> 17:24.144
Guys, this is our chance
to tie things up!

17:24.144 --> 17:28.348
Um, we really need
Mr. Lucas's autograph!

17:28.348 --> 17:31.421
I'm sorry, but Master Lucas is
not taking visitors today.

17:31.421 --> 17:36.356
Let me handle this.
Look, it's Admiral Ackbar!

17:36.356 --> 17:38.088
What? He should be
baking the afternoon scones!

17:40.530 --> 17:42.132
I wouldn't do that, sir.

17:43.793 --> 17:45.665
Oh, yeah? Who's
going to stop me?

17:53.173 --> 17:55.405
Good job, Cameron.

17:55.405 --> 17:57.107
Maybe after this we can go to
Jurassic Park and you can
anger the raptors.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.814
Fire away! We're not leaving
without that autograph!

18:08.818 --> 18:12.262
And you tell Boba Fett that
these grass clippings should
not go in the recycling bin!

18:21.201 --> 18:24.374
We did it! We got
George Lucas' signature.

18:24.374 --> 18:25.635
And we didn't
fake it or anything!

18:27.537 --> 18:29.309
Okay, point Chyna's team!

18:31.741 --> 18:37.116
And now, I will present
the final and tie-breaking
clue using charades.

18:41.291 --> 18:45.495
Um, you need a hearing aid!
You're old and you
need a hearing aid!

18:46.526 --> 18:50.600
Sounds like...
Aging spinster!

18:50.600 --> 18:53.503
FLETCHER: Wrinkled old bat!
We need to find a
wrinkled old bat!

18:55.165 --> 18:56.406
You kids are terrible
at charades!

18:57.867 --> 19:00.170
It's obvious.
We need to get a bell

19:00.170 --> 19:01.411
from a San Francisco
cable car.

19:02.912 --> 19:04.644
What? She dropped her list.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.847
Along with this coupon
for mole hair conditioner.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.319
Give me that!

19:15.885 --> 19:18.388
Come on, Cameron.
We need to hurry.

19:18.388 --> 19:22.232
Forget it. I've been holding
you back all day.

19:22.232 --> 19:24.694
That's not true.
You've been great.

19:24.694 --> 19:27.767
Yeah. You know, other than be
eaten by a snake, destroying
the greatest farts in history,

19:27.767 --> 19:32.372
getting us shot at with
lasers, and worst of all,
woefully folding this map.

19:33.803 --> 19:38.848
See? Go without me.
I'll just mess things up.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.757
(FAINTLY) Cameron, come back.
We really need you.
We're a team.

19:47.757 --> 19:49.889
Okay, well, I tried. Come on,
let's go win this thing.

19:58.298 --> 19:59.769
Chyna.

19:59.769 --> 20:01.631
Lexi.

20:01.631 --> 20:05.675
This cable car
isn't big enough
for the both of us.

20:05.675 --> 20:09.279
Actually, yes, it is. See?
Maximum capacity is sixty.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.717
Would you excuse me
just for like, one second?

20:17.717 --> 20:18.848
Let's go. Thank you.

20:18.848 --> 20:19.749
This bell is mine!

20:19.749 --> 20:22.392
Hey! No, it's mine!

20:22.392 --> 20:23.493
Give it!

20:23.493 --> 20:24.594
It's mine!

20:24.594 --> 20:25.825
(BOTH SCREAMING)

20:25.825 --> 20:27.597
Whoa! Hold on!

20:27.597 --> 20:29.759
I got it! I got the bell!

20:29.759 --> 20:33.303
Lexi, give me the bell
and give me your other hand!
I'll pull you up!

20:33.303 --> 20:36.336
No way! I'm not giving you
the bell. I will not lose
to you again.

20:37.537 --> 20:38.868
What?

20:38.868 --> 20:40.840
Hey guys, look! My house!

20:43.313 --> 20:47.347
Okay, look, I know
you see me as a enemy,
but we need each other.

20:47.347 --> 20:52.322
Just like Luke Skywalker
needed Darth Vader
to make him a better Jedi.

20:52.322 --> 20:55.285
Wait, so you're saying
Lexi is your father? Uh!

20:56.826 --> 20:58.728
Okay. You know what?

20:58.728 --> 21:00.259
Just forget about
the competition.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.732
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

21:02.732 --> 21:04.734
Just let go of the bell.
Please.

21:07.437 --> 21:08.037
Fine.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.700
(CLATTERING)

21:11.371 --> 21:12.442
(GRUNTS)

21:13.573 --> 21:16.346
Thank goodness you're okay!

21:16.346 --> 21:18.708
Who says I'm okay?
I'm missing one
of my earrings!

21:19.849 --> 21:21.951
(THUDDING)

21:21.951 --> 21:22.952
(CAR HONKING)

21:28.788 --> 21:31.321
Well, that's very
disappointing news
about the bell.

21:31.321 --> 21:33.423
But luckily no one got hurt.

21:33.423 --> 21:37.427
As I said, very disappointing
news about the bell.

21:37.427 --> 21:42.932
Hey everybody! Guess who
I found wandering around
the city in a loopy daze?

21:43.773 --> 21:44.904
The mayor!

21:46.606 --> 21:48.708
After I got him home,
I ran into Cameron.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.414
Cameron! How did you get this?

21:54.414 --> 21:57.086
I was on the porch,
wondering how you would
ever get that bell,

21:57.086 --> 21:58.888
and then it hit me.

22:00.820 --> 22:04.023
Ow!

22:04.023 --> 22:09.729
Thank you! Oh, this has great
sentimental value. I had my
first kiss under this bell.

22:10.860 --> 22:12.732
When? In 1896?

22:14.504 --> 22:16.866
No, smart guy.
It was two years ago.

22:21.441 --> 22:25.445
Well, I guess we ended up
winning, but it could have
gone either way.

22:26.976 --> 22:28.948
Good game, Lexi.

22:28.948 --> 22:32.582
What? Good game?
You cannot be serious!

22:32.582 --> 22:34.954
When I win,
then it's a good game!
I am so angry!

22:34.954 --> 22:40.059
YODA-LIKE VOICE:
Anger leads to hate.
Hate leads to suffering.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.942
Mrs. Mills,
you look even worse.
Go to urgent care!

22:52.942 --> 22:53.403
And may the force
be with you.

22:59.008 --> 23:01.681
So, I guess we get
a week off from school.

23:01.681 --> 23:07.487
Yes. It's called spring break.
Oh, and the losing team can
have the same week off school.

23:08.618 --> 23:09.819
Yes!
 Yes!

23:16.726 --> 23:22.572
Cameron, you know what?
I'm really glad I picked you.
We won today because of you.

23:22.572 --> 23:26.836
Yeah, we did, didn't we?
It was pretty amazing.
What are the odds

23:26.836 --> 23:29.408
that out of nowhere,
a bell hits me in the head?

23:29.408 --> 23:29.479
(BELL RINGING)

23:31.010 --> 23:31.410
Oh!
