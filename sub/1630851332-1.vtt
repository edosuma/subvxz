01:06.107 --> 01:09.027
[Britney] When I was 8,
my mom realized I could sing.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.445
I've always wanted to sing.

01:10.528 --> 01:12.572
It's just something
I've always wanted to do.

01:12.655 --> 01:14.908
Five, six, seven, eight, nine…

01:14.991 --> 01:17.660
[woman 1] It's not just luck.
Everybody needs a little bit of luck.

01:17.744 --> 01:20.330
But it's literally an Olympian level

01:20.413 --> 01:23.166
of talent and hard work
that goes into that.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.461
[woman 2] Everything about her
was strong and fearless.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.505
I mean, there was no stopping her.

01:29.589 --> 01:33.760
[woman 3] It all exploded
after Britney became famous.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.638
[woman 4] Suddenly,
she was spiraling out of control,

01:36.721 --> 01:39.557
and it was clear she was having a crisis.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.893
[reporter] Are you concerned
for your daughter, Mr. Spears?

01:41.976 --> 01:44.979
[woman 4] What began
as temporary control over her life

01:45.063 --> 01:47.982
and her money and her business
became permanent.

01:48.650 --> 01:52.070
[woman 3] They felt they had to do it
to protect Britney.

01:52.153 --> 01:54.364
[man 1]
Britney is no longer a free person.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.950
[woman 2]
She doesn't have basic human rights.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.494
She can't write a check
or have a credit card.

01:59.577 --> 02:02.580
[man 2] If she doesn't behave,
she loses custody of her kids.

02:04.124 --> 02:07.210
[man 3] There's other people that've tried
to help. They've paid a heavy price.

02:08.628 --> 02:12.132
[woman 2] She is limited
on how she can voice her wishes.

02:13.007 --> 02:16.761
[Britney] I just want my life back.
And it's been 13 years and it's enough.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.949
[video call ringing]

02:40.618 --> 02:45.456
All right, so let's do
our least favorite thing in the world,

02:45.540 --> 02:49.210
which just means
calling random strangers and saying,

02:49.294 --> 02:51.421
"Hey, can you talk to me
about Britney Spears?"

02:51.504 --> 02:53.798

02:55.466 --> 02:59.012
Hi, Kim, my name is Erin Lee Carr,
and I'm a documentary filmmaker.

02:59.095 --> 03:02.223
I'm directing a project about Britney.

03:03.391 --> 03:06.728
Two years ago, I began making
a movie about Britney Spears

03:06.811 --> 03:08.313
with journalist Jenny Eliscu.

03:08.396 --> 03:11.107
-[voicemail beeps]
-Hey, this is Jenny Eliscu.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.194
I'm not sure if you remember me
from, uh, years ago.

03:14.277 --> 03:18.239
We met when I was working
on a Rolling Stone article about Britney.

03:18.323 --> 03:21.492
[Carr] The movie was going to be about
her artistry and the media portrayal.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.954
And can someone say wow
to those dance moves?

03:25.872 --> 03:28.416
[emotional music playing]

03:31.920 --> 03:35.381
But the story was also about power
and control.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.927
Full of conspiracy and rumors.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.637
And no one would talk.

03:43.473 --> 03:44.474
Until they did.

03:49.395 --> 03:51.731
I was 10 when Britney came on the scene.

03:53.066 --> 03:57.111
I remember grabbing the CD with a flower
on it that's Baby One More Time

03:57.195 --> 03:58.780
and putting it into my boombox.

03:58.863 --> 03:59.781
["Sometimes" playing]

03:59.864 --> 04:01.950
You know, my dad would knock on the door.

04:02.033 --> 04:05.662
And he said, "Why are you listening
to this over and over again?"

04:05.745 --> 04:09.207

04:17.882 --> 04:18.758
I love her.

04:19.759 --> 04:24.555
[Carr] At 16 years old, Britney was
a sensation and she was no one-hit wonder.

04:24.639 --> 04:31.521
From 1998 to 2003, her worldwide
record sales totaled over $73 million.

04:33.606 --> 04:36.150
Britney had a work ethic like none other,

04:36.234 --> 04:38.403
but she's never been motivated by money.

04:38.486 --> 04:41.072
She just was doing something she loved.

04:41.155 --> 04:45.118
[woman 5] She was in control
and involved in every process.

04:45.201 --> 04:49.247
I'm open to ideas. If they come up with
something better, then heck, I'll do it.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.916
[woman 5] She was like, "I'm the boss.
I'm gonna do what I want."

04:52.709 --> 04:56.337
You can see,
like, that girl is just on fire.

05:01.801 --> 05:05.471
[Britney] The best thing about
being famous is knowing that, financially,

05:05.555 --> 05:08.224
I'll be able to support my family,
no matter what.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.309
[woman] Britney Spears!

05:09.392 --> 05:14.605
[Carr] By 2004, she was one of the biggest
selling female artists of her generation.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.982
Hit after hit.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.609
The world couldn't get enough of Britney.

05:23.823 --> 05:26.117
[camera shutters clicking]

05:26.200 --> 05:29.287
Then, suddenly,
Britney stopped making music.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.957
She fell in love with a backup dancer,
Kevin Federline.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.837
On a transatlantic flight,
Britney proposed to Kevin.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.676
They got married
and quickly had two children.

05:44.719 --> 05:49.307
But two years later, the marriage was over
and Britney had filed for divorce.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.809
It's the biggest news in the country,
ladies and gentlemen.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.771
Britney Spears is leaving K-Fed!

05:54.854 --> 05:56.856
[all cheering]

05:57.732 --> 05:59.567
Confetti!

06:00.818 --> 06:03.821
[Carr] Britney was out on the town,
looking as confident as ever.

06:03.905 --> 06:06.407
Now hopefully,
with her divorce almost finalized,

06:06.491 --> 06:08.868
she would get back to performing for us.

06:11.871 --> 06:15.124
But what seemed like the beginning
of her regaining control…

06:16.876 --> 06:18.127
was really the end.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.924
[pensive music playing]

06:28.346 --> 06:30.723
The very first time
I was assigned Britney,

06:30.807 --> 06:34.018
she was in the middle
of this divorce with Kevin.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.896
I was working for an agency, okay?

06:36.979 --> 06:39.816
They gave me the address.
They said, "Sit outside the house."

06:39.899 --> 06:41.776
"When she comes out, follow her."

06:43.820 --> 06:46.656
My job was to take pictures of her, right?

06:47.949 --> 06:51.536
That period, I was a photographer,
and, you know, I was good at it.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.956
I excelled
and I learned the job real quick.

06:55.039 --> 06:56.707
[paparazzi yelling]

06:57.750 --> 07:04.298
This is a job for adrenaline junkies
and those with a gambling addiction.

07:04.841 --> 07:07.927
There's nothing sexier
than waking up and they say,

07:08.010 --> 07:09.220
"This is your assignment."

07:09.303 --> 07:11.180
You open it up and don't know who it is.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.642
Male, female,
actor, singer, sports celebrity.

07:14.725 --> 07:16.561
So, as a photographer,

07:16.644 --> 07:20.982
you can get a few hundred thousand dollars
for a picture of Britney.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.569
[Eliscu] At the time of the divorce,

07:24.652 --> 07:27.613
Britney was relentlessly chased
by the paparazzi.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.576
At the same time,
she had friendships with some of them.

07:32.952 --> 07:33.953
[Ghalib] Beautiful.

07:34.662 --> 07:36.747
One night, the agency calls me

07:36.831 --> 07:38.958
and tells me
the gas station that Britney's at.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.251
I drive down there.

07:40.334 --> 07:43.379
At the gas station,
everyone's taking pictures.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.591
Twenty dollars' worth of gas.

07:46.674 --> 07:49.093
[Ghalib] She was having problems
with the gas.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.261
You want me to fill it?

07:50.803 --> 07:53.181
I asked Britney, "Can I help you?"

07:53.764 --> 07:55.892
So I start doing it.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.901
And then, one day a photographer calls me
and says, "Britney's asking for you."

08:04.984 --> 08:06.611
"What do you mean, she's asking for me?"

08:06.694 --> 08:10.156
Then another photographer calls me
who doesn't know the first photographer.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.867
And he's like,
"Hey, bro. Britney's asking for you."

08:13.451 --> 08:15.328
-Where's--? You, come here.
-[man] Back it up.

08:15.411 --> 08:18.414
[Ghalib] She felt better if I was present.
She felt safer.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.041
Those are her words, not mine.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.586
[whispering] Where's Adnan?

08:23.669 --> 08:25.004
[man] He's off.

08:25.087 --> 08:26.464
He's out today.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.924
I'll let him know.

08:31.844 --> 08:36.766
[Ghalib] It was a very simple,
very easy relationship, you know?

08:37.391 --> 08:41.437
But between her fans and everybody else,
it was like I was the bad guy.

08:43.022 --> 08:44.398
Oh, my Lord.

08:44.482 --> 08:48.277
[Ghalib] Like that Disney story,
you always want the Prince Charming to be

08:48.361 --> 08:52.532
as equally as attractive and equally
as beautiful and equally as charming.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.575
We didn't have that balance.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.578
There was this multimillionaire and me.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.538
[indistinct chatter]

08:58.621 --> 09:01.999
And then there was this famous girl,
and then there was me.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.878
There was this white girl,
and there was me.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.091
There were nights where she was up

09:10.174 --> 09:12.718
and I had to stay up with her,
and it's hard.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.679
To stay up for three days, it's hard,

09:14.762 --> 09:17.473
but you have that fear,
it's a very real fear,

09:17.557 --> 09:19.475
that if anything happens to her,

09:20.059 --> 09:23.104
they're just gonna blame you.
It's just so much easier to blame you.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.650
She was taking Adderall.

09:27.733 --> 09:31.988
I'm sure x-amount of millions of people
are taking Adderall.

09:32.071 --> 09:37.785
But these are the things
that become volatile and deadly weapons

09:37.868 --> 09:40.746
when you're going through
a child custody case.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.876
[woman] Hi, Adnan, how are you?

09:46.544 --> 09:49.422
Are you okay? Are you guys in love?

09:49.505 --> 09:51.507
[dramatic music playing]

09:59.348 --> 10:02.852
[Ghalib] What was apparent to me
during this divorce with Kevin

10:02.935 --> 10:06.522
was, you know, she never had one person
she could trust, not one.

10:06.606 --> 10:09.984
Not Mom, not Dad,
not friends, not her sister.

10:10.067 --> 10:11.402
Anybody.

10:11.485 --> 10:15.197
And that's a very scary, dark place to be.

10:16.782 --> 10:19.285
[dramatic music playing]

10:25.458 --> 10:31.172
The hearing this afternoon had to do
with a continued interim,

10:31.255 --> 10:32.923
or temporary order,

10:33.007 --> 10:37.928
that was based on Mr. Federline's
original request to modify custody.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.514
[man] Hold on. Hey, hey.
Get back. Get back, sir.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.434
-[man 1] You guys have got to get back.
-[man 2] Britney!

10:43.517 --> 10:44.977
[man 3] We love you, Britney!

10:45.895 --> 10:49.440
[Carr] By 2007, Britney's divorce
from Kevin was heating up.

10:50.733 --> 10:54.862
What many thought would be a simple case,
guided by a strong prenuptial agreement,

10:54.945 --> 10:56.906
now seemed to be in question.

10:56.989 --> 11:02.036
Ironclad prenup's a little bit like
the Titanic could never sink.

11:02.119 --> 11:06.248
For every ironclad prenup,
there's a group of attorneys out there

11:06.332 --> 11:07.875
that will try to tear it apart.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.253
[Eliscu] Mark Vincent Kaplan,
he's the K-Fed lawyer.

11:11.337 --> 11:15.466
He's like this kind of old guard,
bigtime custody lawyer

11:15.549 --> 11:19.345
you might call
in a contentious divorce custody case.

11:19.428 --> 11:22.306
He seemed to love being the spokesperson

11:22.390 --> 11:26.143
for this high-profile divorce
and custody case.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.814
And he definitely has a flair
for making a public statement.

11:29.897 --> 11:34.985
The ultimate attack is,
how are the children doing?

11:35.069 --> 11:37.029
How safe are the children?

11:37.113 --> 11:39.573
The kids become just pawns.

11:39.657 --> 11:44.704
Kevin is concerned that the more time
that the children are with him,

11:44.787 --> 11:47.123
he feels the more insulated
they are from, uh…

11:48.582 --> 11:52.420
risks that would otherwise be
constantly visited upon them.

11:53.087 --> 11:57.425
People that care about the children
will provide information

11:57.508 --> 12:00.177
that is relevant to their best interest.

12:00.261 --> 12:03.889
There's nothing new, no new facts,
there's not an emergency?

12:03.973 --> 12:05.433
All of those things are true.

12:05.516 --> 12:09.311
I'd represented high-profile people
and celebrities before,

12:09.395 --> 12:14.567
but this was an order of magnitude far
different than anything I'd experienced.

12:14.650 --> 12:19.488
And I had to hit the deck running
and learn how to work with the media

12:19.572 --> 12:22.199
so that they weren't working
against my client.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.912
Kevin had been treated pretty unfairly.

12:26.996 --> 12:29.749
They were saying,
"He's an unconcerned parent."

12:29.832 --> 12:34.628
Other people were saying,
"Oh, he's just merely a gold digger."

12:34.712 --> 12:37.381
He was in a position
of not being able to win.

12:37.465 --> 12:39.717
Damned if he did, damned if he didn't.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.553
[Carr] People wanted to sort of speak ill
of him or use him as a joke.

12:42.636 --> 12:43.804
Why'd you think that was?

12:43.888 --> 12:49.643
Well, keep in mind when Kevin
and Britney first got married,

12:49.727 --> 12:55.149
she was America's sweetheart.
And in many respects, she still is.

12:55.232 --> 13:01.197
And they saw Kevin as someone
who in their view, whoever "their" is,

13:01.280 --> 13:05.951
wasn't worthy of having that unique
relationship with America's sweetheart.

13:06.452 --> 13:10.539
They attempted to penalize him for that
as much as they could and they--

13:10.623 --> 13:12.249
The press was brutal.

13:12.333 --> 13:15.002
But as the case progressed,

13:15.544 --> 13:18.839
um, I think she did certain things

13:18.923 --> 13:23.427
that the press found worthy
of a media frenzy.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.513
[eerie music playing]

13:30.142 --> 13:34.563
[Carr] As the custody case was battled out
in court, the media frenzy only grew.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.944
Everyone seemed to have opinion
about Britney Spears.

13:40.027 --> 13:42.363
The media focused less on her music

13:42.446 --> 13:44.782
and more on the way
that she was living her life.

13:47.618 --> 13:51.914
Britney cycled through legal teams,
and became more and more isolated.

13:52.456 --> 13:56.335
There was a period of estrangement
between Britney and both of her parents

13:56.418 --> 13:59.046
by fall of 2007.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.757
I don't know how long
the estrangements were, where--

14:01.841 --> 14:03.968
Whether there was maybe
sporadic communication,

14:04.051 --> 14:07.137
but some sources I spoke to
talked about Britney

14:07.221 --> 14:10.599
having a fear
that her family would barge in,

14:10.683 --> 14:14.979
I think is how it was put,
and take everything.

14:15.062 --> 14:20.317
I mean, and that's, you know,
that's how-slash-when Sam Lutfi got in.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.444
[Carr] Who is Sam Lutfi?

14:22.528 --> 14:27.825
[Eliscu] Sam Lutfi is the person
frequently blamed by both of her parents

14:27.908 --> 14:30.244
for her public downfall.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.790
[Carr] There was a lot of controversy
around Sam Lutfi

14:34.874 --> 14:38.002
and what role he played
in this brief period of Britney's life.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.549
First question.
Can you please introduce yourself to us?

14:44.133 --> 14:47.011
-Uh, I'm Sam Lutfi.
-And who are you?

14:48.220 --> 14:50.848
I'm Britney Spears's former manager.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.978
[Carr] But in court documents
newly discovered from Britney's divorce,

14:56.061 --> 14:59.064
she testified that he was
just her "friend sometimes."

14:59.857 --> 15:01.901
Somebody who helped "get groceries."

15:07.448 --> 15:10.534
In that time period,
he went from being the sometimes friend

15:10.618 --> 15:12.953
to somebody calling the shots.

15:13.037 --> 15:16.540
[Lutfi]
We met at a bar. We started talking.

15:16.624 --> 15:18.167
She was very funny.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.419
Uh, we had a great conversation.

15:21.003 --> 15:25.007
Um, she had asked me
if I'd seen things that were in the press.

15:25.090 --> 15:29.219
I said, "Of course. Like, who hasn't?"
You know, making light of the situation.

15:29.303 --> 15:31.096
She asked for my phone number.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.183
And then left and I never thought
I was gonna hear from her again.

15:34.266 --> 15:37.561
Then I get a call from her one night
and she tells me,

15:37.645 --> 15:38.646
"I need your help."

15:38.729 --> 15:40.564
[woman] Hey, guys. Just be careful.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.566
[man] Just clear this side for a second.

15:42.650 --> 15:47.237
[Lutfi] You could see
that the divorce was impacting her a lot.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.740
And my question to her the whole time was,

15:50.741 --> 15:53.202
"I think the best thing would be
to have your family around."

15:53.285 --> 15:55.162
"There's nothing
like having your mom around."

15:55.245 --> 15:59.792
That's how it is in my life,
but I was just projecting that onto that.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.503
Um, and she would just say,

16:02.586 --> 16:06.423
"My relationship is not like
your relationship with your family."

16:06.507 --> 16:09.343
I thought, "What's the issue?"
And so she would--

16:09.426 --> 16:11.303
We would talk about Lynne,

16:11.929 --> 16:13.681
uh, in depth.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.809
So there was numerous issues
that were going on.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.770
[Carr] And how was
her father Jamie involved?

16:20.437 --> 16:21.605
Not at all.

16:21.689 --> 16:24.817
Was it a short amount of time,
a long amount of time?

16:25.651 --> 16:27.861
Uh, from what I believe, it's been years.

16:28.737 --> 16:30.739
[paparazzi clamoring]

16:32.950 --> 16:35.369
[Carr] In the eye of the storm
that was 2007,

16:35.452 --> 16:39.623
Britney was still able to record
and produce an entire studio record.

16:39.707 --> 16:40.958
♪ It's Britney, bitch ♪

16:41.041 --> 16:42.793
["Gimme More" playing]

16:42.876 --> 16:46.505
[Carr] The album was Blackout
and it sold in the millions.

16:46.588 --> 16:48.549
It is widely considered her best work.

16:49.633 --> 16:51.093
["Break the Ice" playing]

16:51.176 --> 16:54.555
The music and the videos
from Blackout portrayed a pop-y version

16:54.638 --> 16:57.683
of what had become
the story of Britney's real life.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.645
A woman hunted and often on the run.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.273
-[camera shutter clicks]
-[ominous music playing]

17:04.356 --> 17:07.776
This would foreshadow
a much darker turn for Britney.

17:07.860 --> 17:11.238
There are paparazzi images
of Britney in 2007

17:11.822 --> 17:14.241
that have been seen millions of times.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.203
These images are often coupled
with headlines like,

17:18.287 --> 17:20.956
"Meltdown" or "Rock Bottom."

17:22.041 --> 17:25.044
Looking back,
you can see she was just a person,

17:26.211 --> 17:27.880
a person who needed help.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.093
[haunting music playing]

17:38.849 --> 17:41.894
Throughout that year, paparazzi continued
to follow Britney aggressively

17:41.977 --> 17:43.604
around Los Angeles.

17:48.776 --> 17:49.985
[woman] She's crazy.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.321
Oh, my God.

17:55.949 --> 17:58.077
[Carr] She drove at high speeds
to avoid them,

17:58.160 --> 18:00.454
sometimes running red lights.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.791
There were concerns
that if these car chases continued,

18:03.874 --> 18:06.251
something terrible could happen.

18:11.006 --> 18:14.718
A lot of people argue

18:14.802 --> 18:17.763
that she was crazy, right?

18:17.846 --> 18:20.516
You know, and I fucking hate that word.

18:20.599 --> 18:23.435
Would you say she was upset,
would you say she was angry,

18:23.519 --> 18:25.395
or would you say she was hurt?

18:25.479 --> 18:27.606
I'd choose all of them
before I'd choose crazy.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.165
[helicopter whirring]

18:47.793 --> 18:49.795
[sirens wailing]

18:50.504 --> 18:52.506
[dramatic music playing]

19:04.393 --> 19:08.730
[Carr] In January 2008,
police were called to Britney's residence.

19:08.814 --> 19:10.899
She had locked herself in a room,

19:10.983 --> 19:14.403
refusing to turn over the children
to Federline's bodyguard

19:14.486 --> 19:16.405
at the court appointed time.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.662
[siren wailing]

20:05.746 --> 20:06.747
[man] Listen up!

20:06.830 --> 20:08.999
Cedar Sinai, this is their property,

20:09.082 --> 20:11.960
including the sidewalk
that you are standing on.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.462
I need to you to move.

20:15.380 --> 20:19.551
[Carr] At the hospital there was Kevin,
Mark Vincent Kaplan, his lawyer,

20:20.761 --> 20:21.929
and Britney's father.

20:24.097 --> 20:27.226
Britney's parents had been divorced
since 2002.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.354
[Culotta] Britney was so close
with her mother.

20:31.021 --> 20:32.231
When we were on tour,

20:32.314 --> 20:34.483
I mean, she and Lynne talked at least--

20:34.566 --> 20:37.486
Oh, gosh. At the very least,
two or three times a day.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.363
[Carr] And what about her dad, Jamie?

20:39.446 --> 20:43.742
Okay, I don't wanna talk about her daddy.
I don't wanna talk about Jamie.

20:43.825 --> 20:44.993
Um…

20:45.619 --> 20:49.790
The reason I don't--
I will tell you this just so we'll know.

20:49.873 --> 20:53.252
Jamie wasn't with us very often,
hardly ever.

20:53.752 --> 20:56.338
Um, so it really was me and Lynne.

20:57.214 --> 21:00.342
[Carr] A few days after Britney
was released from the hospital,

21:00.425 --> 21:01.718
a new figure emerged.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.638
Her name was Louise Taylor.

21:04.721 --> 21:08.850
And she went on The Today Show
as a spokesperson for the Spears family.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.187
[Taylor] What I would like to say is that

21:12.271 --> 21:15.941
I really feel like people
just do not know the Spears family.

21:16.024 --> 21:19.278
What they don't know about Jamie
and Lynne Spears is that every day,

21:19.361 --> 21:21.863
Jamie goes to work as a professional chef,

21:21.947 --> 21:25.826
asking the Lord to give him the strength
to honor the people he works for

21:25.909 --> 21:29.496
in the midst of circumstances,
that Lynne Spears is a mother

21:29.579 --> 21:32.874
that is brokenhearted just because
she's apart from her daughter.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.876
She loves her daughter so much.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.880
And again, asking every day
for God to give her strength

21:38.964 --> 21:41.174
and for her to continue to have hope.

21:41.258 --> 21:45.887
I mean, I'm so disturbed, Meredith,
where we've gotten to be as a people,

21:45.971 --> 21:49.808
the morbidity of us watching
the depravity of people suffering,

21:49.891 --> 21:52.060
than to rally around and be hopeful.

21:52.144 --> 21:55.939
So, really, for, I guess, for me
to be self-indulgent for a moment,

21:56.023 --> 21:59.609
that I would really hope that all those
who seek God for strength in their life

21:59.693 --> 22:03.155
would be interceding for this family
because Jamie Spears,

22:03.238 --> 22:05.991
Lynne Spears, Bryan, and Jamie Lynn Spears

22:06.074 --> 22:08.201
are all amazing people.

22:09.786 --> 22:13.623
[Carr] From what I'd seen, no one had ever
spoken on behalf of the Spears.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.460
[Carr] Who is Lou Taylor?

22:16.543 --> 22:18.378
I will not touch that one.

22:20.213 --> 22:21.590
Sorry.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.801
She will chew me up
and spit me out. [chuckles]

22:25.719 --> 22:27.721
[paparazzi chattering]

22:28.805 --> 22:31.433
[Carr] The custody suit grew
more contentious

22:31.516 --> 22:36.021
when the judge gave Kevin Federline
full custody of the two boys.

22:36.104 --> 22:39.274
Soon thereafter,
Britney would return to the hospital

22:39.358 --> 22:42.361
under another
involuntary psychiatric hold.

22:42.444 --> 22:45.572
[man] Mr. Spears, what's going on?
How's Britney doing?

22:47.657 --> 22:49.576
Can you give us any word,
any news on Britney?

22:51.119 --> 22:54.581
[Carr] Jamie Spears petitioned
the State of California probate court

22:54.664 --> 22:56.375
for a new legal arrangement.

22:58.418 --> 23:00.921
It was called a conservatorship.

23:04.091 --> 23:06.093
[dramatic music playing]

23:19.439 --> 23:23.193
[Eliscu] I started working
at Rolling Stone in '99.

23:23.276 --> 23:26.947
Britney was my second-ever cover story.

23:27.030 --> 23:30.325
I didn't give a shit about Britney Spears
or pop music personally.

23:30.409 --> 23:33.078
It's not something
I paid attention to at all.

23:33.620 --> 23:39.418
Then I met her,
and she was just so likable and sweet.

23:40.419 --> 23:44.548
So, in late 2008, when I was assigned
to do another cover story

23:44.631 --> 23:46.508
on Britney for Rolling Stone,

23:46.591 --> 23:50.512
I was excited 'cause I love her
and hadn't seen her in a few years.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.556
And in spite of all of the drama,

23:52.639 --> 23:55.267
I was just picturing it the same way
it always would be,

23:55.350 --> 23:57.686
and, you know, went to L.A.

23:57.769 --> 24:02.190
ready to spend some time
and started to get told by the label

24:02.274 --> 24:04.443
that I'd have to submit
my questions ahead of time.

24:04.526 --> 24:08.321
I said to the publicist,
"But it's me, me and Britney."

24:08.405 --> 24:11.992
And she would say, "Oh, you know,
we know Britney loves you,

24:12.075 --> 24:15.036
but we just--
The conservatorship, we've got to."

24:15.912 --> 24:18.373
I was like,
"What the fuck is a conservatorship?"

24:23.295 --> 24:29.801
A conservatorship is a legal process
for taking somebody's ability

24:29.885 --> 24:32.304
to make their own decisions away from them

24:32.387 --> 24:36.141
and giving them to some third party,
aka their conservator,

24:36.224 --> 24:38.477
or in other states, it's the guardian.

24:40.270 --> 24:44.191
Obviously, any process
to deprive someone of those liberties

24:44.274 --> 24:46.276
and those freedoms would be something

24:46.359 --> 24:49.571
we'd want to impose very rarely,
only as a last resort,

24:49.654 --> 24:52.449
having tried
and exhausted all other alternatives.

24:53.033 --> 24:57.120
Some people have called conservatorship
tantamount to a civil death.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.291
There's conservatorship of the person,

25:01.374 --> 25:04.169
which is allowing someone else
to make your decisions

25:04.252 --> 25:06.463
related to your personal affairs.

25:06.546 --> 25:10.342
They lose the ability to decide
anything related to their healthcare,

25:10.425 --> 25:13.678
so their ability to provide
or withhold informed consent

25:13.762 --> 25:17.599
for treatments, including drugs,
is taken away from them.

25:17.682 --> 25:19.559
And, in many cases, they lose their right

25:19.643 --> 25:22.312
to decide who to visit with
or receive visits from.

25:22.395 --> 25:25.482
They lose their right to communicate
with people of their choosing

25:25.565 --> 25:27.400
over the telephone, over the computer.

25:28.860 --> 25:30.529
For a conservatorship of the estate,

25:30.612 --> 25:33.490
which often goes
with the conservatorship of the person,

25:33.573 --> 25:35.659
they're no longer in charge
of their money,

25:35.742 --> 25:39.120
theoretically, even the $10
they might have in their pocket.

25:39.204 --> 25:40.455
[camera shutter clicks]

25:40.539 --> 25:43.875
[Eliscu] Jamie was made
the sole conservator of the person.

25:43.959 --> 25:46.378
He had to share
the conservatorship of the estate

25:46.461 --> 25:49.506
with a court-appointed attorney
named Andrew Wallet.

25:53.009 --> 25:56.304
You had Jamie who had bankruptcy issues

25:56.388 --> 25:59.474
and financial mismanagement
of his own life,

25:59.558 --> 26:03.353
and they said, "We have Andrew Wallet
here as the co-conservator,

26:03.436 --> 26:05.272
and has a fiduciary interest,"

26:05.355 --> 26:06.856
but in court documents,

26:06.940 --> 26:10.569
he talked about the conservatorship
as being a "hybrid business model."

26:10.652 --> 26:12.654
[ominous music playing]

26:18.410 --> 26:22.998
[Eliscu] According to the papers filed
with the court on February 6, 2008,

26:23.081 --> 26:25.917
the conservators have access
to all documents and records

26:26.001 --> 26:27.544
related to Britney's estate.

26:27.627 --> 26:31.506
They can enter and take possession
of her house, kick people out,

26:31.590 --> 26:35.010
they can issue restraining orders,
and employ security guards,

26:35.093 --> 26:37.887
they can use Britney's money
to pay attorneys for matters

26:37.971 --> 26:41.725
involving the estate,
open and operate businesses,

26:41.808 --> 26:44.394
hire people for any position necessary,

26:44.477 --> 26:47.355
and pay them using funds from the estate.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.526
Why was Jamie made the conservator
and not Lynne?

26:51.610 --> 26:53.945
Jamie is intimidating,
and people who have known him

26:54.029 --> 26:55.530
and met him and worked with him,

26:55.614 --> 26:57.616
and even had positive experiences
with him,

26:57.699 --> 27:00.660
will still tell you
that he is very intimidating

27:00.744 --> 27:03.830
and when he's angry,
you don't want to mess with him.

27:05.498 --> 27:07.167
They were really in a moment

27:07.250 --> 27:10.503
where they felt they needed
to keep away certain people,

27:10.587 --> 27:13.840
and he was like the bouncer.
He could keep people out.

27:14.883 --> 27:16.384
[Carr] Here we've got…

27:17.010 --> 27:19.554
[Eliscu] Larry Rudolph,
Britney's longtime manager.

27:19.638 --> 27:24.017
He started in 1996 as her attorney
and then grew into her manager.

27:24.100 --> 27:27.187
But, uh, in April of 2007,
Britney fired him.

27:28.313 --> 27:32.734
Larry was the main person
that Jamie Spears brought back

27:32.817 --> 27:35.695
to get things running,
and he's been her manager ever since.

27:35.779 --> 27:38.907
And he often will say
that he's not involved

27:38.990 --> 27:42.202
with the conservatorship
or that he doesn't know what goes on,

27:42.285 --> 27:44.663
that he only knows
what goes on with Britney's work.

27:47.457 --> 27:50.669
Louise Taylor, aka Lou,
led business decisions at times

27:50.752 --> 27:52.712
over the course of the conservatorship.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.507
Louise Taylor's husband, Rob Taylor,

27:55.590 --> 27:58.385
is the pastor
of a church called Calvary Chapel.

27:59.010 --> 28:02.764
[man] Lou Taylor started appearing
around 2008,

28:02.847 --> 28:05.058
before the conservatorship.

28:05.141 --> 28:08.520
And we know this because
there is paparazzi footage of her

28:08.603 --> 28:10.105
with Britney's father, Jamie.

28:13.066 --> 28:18.196
And then she somehow managed
to become Britney's business manager.

28:19.072 --> 28:24.703
She is a Christian, so they trusted her
a lot more because of that.

28:25.620 --> 28:28.415
[Carr] Lou Taylor,
through her attorney Charles Harder,

28:28.498 --> 28:30.583
sent me a pre-emptive legal letter

28:30.667 --> 28:36.339
regarding any mention of Lou Taylor
or her company, Tri Star, in this film.

28:36.423 --> 28:38.758
The letter was extensive.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.708
When I got this notice, I was alarmed.

29:11.791 --> 29:15.378
But receiving a letter
from Lou Taylor or her attorney

29:15.462 --> 29:18.673
was not unusual
for people involved in the story.

29:20.133 --> 29:23.344
While Lou's involvement
with Britney wasn't clear,

29:23.428 --> 29:27.348
what was apparent was
that Jamie and Lou were very close.

29:27.432 --> 29:30.935
Some sleuthing of Instagram
showed Lou and her husband

29:31.019 --> 29:34.355
with Jamie on the day
of his baptism at the Jordan River.

29:36.649 --> 29:39.611
This is paperwork
relating to Britney's condition

29:39.694 --> 29:41.279
at the start of the conservatorship.

29:41.362 --> 29:43.198
It's… It's kind of a standard form

29:43.281 --> 29:46.326
where you indicate
what the person's impairment is

29:46.409 --> 29:48.077
that requires a conservatorship.

29:48.161 --> 29:49.996
Specifically, this is interesting to us

29:50.079 --> 29:53.166
because it's orders
related to dementia placement.

29:53.249 --> 29:55.251
[eerie music playing]

29:59.798 --> 30:04.427
You don't usually see dementia mentioned
with, you know, with a young person.

30:10.016 --> 30:14.938
This is one of the most important filings
in the entire conservatorship

30:15.021 --> 30:18.733
because when someone is being made
a conservatee,

30:18.817 --> 30:21.402
they're entitled to five days' heads-up,

30:21.486 --> 30:25.198
so that if they want to contest it,
or find a lawyer, et cetera,

30:25.281 --> 30:26.825
they have time to do that.

30:26.908 --> 30:30.620
The only reason given
for depriving Britney of five days' notice

30:30.703 --> 30:35.291
is that Sam Lutfi is dangerous
and needs to be kept away.

30:36.334 --> 30:38.753
Don't push! Don't push.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.506
Get off! Off! Off!

30:41.589 --> 30:42.757
[camera shutter clicks]

30:43.341 --> 30:46.553
[Craker]
It was total crisis mode with Sam,

30:46.636 --> 30:50.515
and that is something that I don't believe
has really been portrayed correctly,

30:50.598 --> 30:53.768
is the level of crisis

30:53.852 --> 30:57.689
at the moment
that the conservatorship began.

30:57.772 --> 30:59.941
Are you going to [bleep] get out?

31:00.024 --> 31:02.443
Oh, my God,
please get the [bleep] out of the way!

31:02.527 --> 31:05.196
Now I'm scared you're gonna drive off
without me.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.740
Now get out of the passenger seat,
get out of the [bleep] car.

31:07.824 --> 31:10.118
Get out, get out, get out. Thank you.

31:11.369 --> 31:15.540
They felt they had to do it
to protect Britney from Sam.

31:15.623 --> 31:18.209
We're sort of alluding to what happened,

31:18.293 --> 31:21.004
that something dangerous
was happening with Sam.

31:21.087 --> 31:23.381
What do you think was going to happen?

31:23.464 --> 31:26.634
He was crushing drugs
and putting them in her food

31:26.718 --> 31:30.138
-and bragging about it to…[Carr] And you 100% believe that?

31:31.931 --> 31:32.765
Yeah.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.521
[Britney] Drive my [bleep] car,
that's what I got to do.

31:40.690 --> 31:44.569
You have a hundred blood tests
and drug tests.

31:44.652 --> 31:47.488
The entire time I was with her,
she passed every single one of them,

31:47.572 --> 31:50.658
which is why the police never came
to my door.

31:50.742 --> 31:52.243
No one called the police.

31:52.327 --> 31:56.748
To be char--
Accused of allegations that serious,

31:56.831 --> 32:02.295
that you're drugging the world's
biggest star, you call the police.

32:02.378 --> 32:04.589
You call the FBI. You don't call TMZ.

32:05.548 --> 32:07.884
-I was the perfect scapegoat.
-[Carr] Why?

32:08.718 --> 32:11.304
I was new. They didn't know who I was.

32:11.387 --> 32:13.431
I was just an expendable guy.

32:13.514 --> 32:16.434
Like, all right,
if that's what you need to get this done

32:16.517 --> 32:18.811
and waive a five-day notice,
and explain a five-day notice,

32:18.895 --> 32:24.317
it means that she would have been notified
that this was gonna happen,

32:24.400 --> 32:26.527
and she would've had
the right to contest to it.

32:26.611 --> 32:30.156
She would have obviously contested it.
They knew that, everyone knew that.

32:30.239 --> 32:33.952
And so they had to do everything
to prevent that from happening.

32:35.078 --> 32:36.079
[horn honks]

32:37.622 --> 32:40.708
[Carr] Sam would later sue Lynne Spears,
Britney's mom,

32:40.792 --> 32:44.337
for defamation based on her account
of his involvement.

33:20.289 --> 33:22.291
[dramatic music playing]

33:25.294 --> 33:30.299
Britney went with one
of her dad's appointed security guards…

33:31.384 --> 33:33.136
out to get a hamburger.

33:33.219 --> 33:36.139
As I am told,
they both entered the restaurant,

33:36.222 --> 33:38.266
and Britney sort of did an about-face,

33:38.349 --> 33:42.687
jumped into the car
that he had brought her in and took off.

33:44.522 --> 33:48.359
Uh, she called me
and said that she needed help.

33:49.694 --> 33:53.948
I met her and a friend of hers
at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.117
-[Carr] Adnan Ghalib?
-[Grossman] Correct.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.495
We called Adam.

33:59.579 --> 34:03.875
He was a part of a firm
that I had a relationship with.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.793
[helicopter whirring]

34:05.877 --> 34:12.050
We were chased probably by,
I don't know, 50, 75 vehicles.

34:13.634 --> 34:15.553
[paparazzi clamoring]

34:15.636 --> 34:17.138
It is so mean.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.687
[Streisand] We met in my office,
which was crazy,

34:24.771 --> 34:28.524
'cause we had helicopters
swirling over the building.

34:28.608 --> 34:30.902
There must have been a hundred paparazzi.

34:31.694 --> 34:33.613
I sent down my secretary,

34:33.696 --> 34:35.823
who brought a guy from the mailroom

34:35.907 --> 34:38.409
who's like 6'6" and 250 pounds,

34:38.493 --> 34:41.662
to help Britney get up
from the garage to my office.

34:41.746 --> 34:42.747
[Ghalib] Yes.

34:42.830 --> 34:46.334
-[woman] I'm Adam's secretary.
-We gotta go.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.002
[woman] Just follow me.

34:48.086 --> 34:50.088
My secretary, Dolores Gameros,

34:50.171 --> 34:53.674
who's like 5'4",
was elbowing everybody out of the way

34:53.758 --> 34:55.676
and getting her through the crowd

34:55.760 --> 34:59.555
and got her up to the office,
which was just an unbelievable sight.

34:59.639 --> 35:05.269
But you can imagine what it is like
for anyone to have to go through that.

35:05.353 --> 35:07.355
[crowd clamoring]

35:13.194 --> 35:14.445
[man] Don't kick me!

35:16.322 --> 35:20.368
I can't tell you about what we talked
about, right? Because that's privileged.

35:20.451 --> 35:23.579
But I can tell you what I told the court.

35:26.666 --> 35:29.293
So we walk into court and I said,

35:29.377 --> 35:32.213
"Your Honor, she doesn't want
her father to be the conservator."

35:32.296 --> 35:35.049
"She wants an independent
to be the conservator."

35:35.133 --> 35:38.678
She clearly understood
the concept of a conservatorship.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.721
She understood what was going to happen.

35:40.805 --> 35:44.016
She could make some decisions about it,
and let me say,

35:44.100 --> 35:48.437
I'm not gonna say that in every case,
every conservatorship case,

35:48.521 --> 35:52.233
it's inappropriate to have
a family member as the conservator.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.985
That would be going too far.

35:54.068 --> 36:00.449
But I will say that I generally prefer
to see an independent professional

36:00.533 --> 36:01.784
as the conservator.

36:01.868 --> 36:06.622
And the reason is that family
relationships are always complex.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.917
When I told the judge what Britney wanted,

36:10.001 --> 36:11.961
the judge looked at me and said,

36:12.044 --> 36:18.259
"Mr. Streisand, I have a report
that says she does not have the capacity

36:18.342 --> 36:22.513
to retain counsel
and have an attorney-client relationship."

36:22.597 --> 36:25.266
"So I'm sorry, Mr. Streisand,

36:25.349 --> 36:27.643
but you're not gonna be able
to represent her

36:27.727 --> 36:30.730
and I need to ask you
to the leave the courtroom." And I did.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.651
[man 1] Can you give us a heads-up
on what happened here today?

36:35.735 --> 36:36.736
No, I'm sorry.

36:36.819 --> 36:39.614
-I've talked to the press.
-[man 2] How's Britney?

36:40.615 --> 36:42.575
There's no law that says that conservatees

36:42.658 --> 36:44.952
have the right
to the attorney of their choice.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.413
It's a hole in the system, for sure,

36:47.496 --> 36:50.750
that allows the courts
to impose their own ideas

36:50.833 --> 36:54.754
of what is the best representation
for the conservatee.

36:54.837 --> 36:58.341
They have what's called
this volunteer panel of lawyers,

36:58.424 --> 37:00.635
which basically means
that the lawyers volunteer.

37:00.718 --> 37:03.930
Doesn't mean they're working for free.
Far from it.

37:04.013 --> 37:07.058
But they volunteer
to get appointed by the court

37:07.141 --> 37:08.684
to represent people like Britney,

37:08.768 --> 37:12.772
people who are conservatees
or proposed conservatees.

37:12.855 --> 37:17.568
I can't tell you what happened
in court after I left.

37:17.652 --> 37:21.113
I don't know whether Sam Ingham,

37:21.197 --> 37:25.910
who was appointed as her lawyer,
argued the way that I argued,

37:25.993 --> 37:28.746
that the conservator
shouldn't be Britney's father.

37:28.829 --> 37:30.248
I've got my suspicions.

37:31.207 --> 37:36.045
I sure hope Sam Ingham
fought hard against, uh, against it,

37:36.128 --> 37:37.755
but I never heard that he did.

37:39.966 --> 37:44.011
[Chicotel] We have very particular
standards for conservatorship.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.722
You have to be unable to meet your needs

37:46.806 --> 37:49.225
for food, clothing, health, and shelter.

37:49.308 --> 37:50.309
So let me put it this way,

37:50.393 --> 37:53.271
I've represented
dozens of conservatees in court,

37:53.354 --> 37:55.439
not one of them has ever had a job.

37:57.066 --> 37:59.527
[ominous music playing]

37:59.610 --> 38:01.529
Somebody called me from People
and they said,

38:01.612 --> 38:06.158
"We're gonna write a story
in regards to her father

38:06.242 --> 38:08.744
wanting conservatorship of Britney."

38:09.745 --> 38:14.292
They basically, you know,
explained it in one sentence.

38:14.375 --> 38:18.004
"He will be Britney Spears."
That's all they said.

38:18.087 --> 38:21.173
I said, "What do you mean?
Britney Spears is still here."

38:21.257 --> 38:27.763
"Nope. She no longer has rights
or say over anything."

38:27.847 --> 38:29.348
"He does."

38:29.432 --> 38:32.601
I'm like,
"Well, why would that be the case?"

38:32.685 --> 38:33.936
"She's functioning."

38:34.020 --> 38:38.399
I watched her write the Blackout album
on a Starbucks napkin

38:38.482 --> 38:41.610
on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City.

38:42.403 --> 38:46.741
I watched her sit there
and put the moves together.

38:46.824 --> 38:49.368
And we're talking about, you know,

38:49.452 --> 38:52.455
what colors to use
and, you know, the scenery,

38:52.538 --> 38:55.875
and the change of scenery,
and the backdrop and costumes.

38:56.459 --> 38:58.878
She did all that, and you're telling me

38:58.961 --> 39:03.257
that her father's gonna get
a conservatorship?

39:03.341 --> 39:04.967
It didn't make sense to me.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.178
[journalist] I'm from In Touch magazine.

39:07.261 --> 39:10.139
Let me give you a fucking clue,
I don't talk to no-fucking-body.

39:10.222 --> 39:12.183
[journalist] Why don't you talk to us?

39:12.266 --> 39:14.769
'Cause I never have to talk
to anybody, you dumb fuck.

39:33.287 --> 39:35.289
[suspenseful music playing]

40:11.492 --> 40:12.660
[Carr] The source said,

40:12.743 --> 40:16.455
"This is a confidential report
only a select few have access."

40:16.539 --> 40:18.416
"Most doctors and other professionals

40:18.499 --> 40:20.668
have not been publicly connected
to the case

40:20.751 --> 40:22.378
and would like to remain that way."

40:22.461 --> 40:26.924
"The report was produced by a doctor
that resigned from the case in 2013."

40:30.136 --> 40:32.555
Look at this sentence right here.
Read it out loud.

40:32.638 --> 40:37.017
[Eliscu] "Britney Spears lacks capacity
to retain and direct counsel."

40:39.061 --> 40:42.398
"Britney Spears lacks the capacity
to understand or manage

40:42.481 --> 40:46.861
her own financial affairs
without being subject to undue influence."

40:46.944 --> 40:50.448
What's wild is, at the same time
this report was written,

40:50.531 --> 40:52.199
Britney was back to work.

40:52.283 --> 40:54.660
She was on the set
of How I Met Your Mother.

40:54.743 --> 40:57.329
Sir, please don't yell at me,
because when people yell at me,

40:57.413 --> 40:59.415
I have a tendency to start crying.

40:59.498 --> 41:03.461
[Eliscu] The episode was out within two
months of the conservatorship starting.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.713
When they're rude to you,
hang up the phone.

41:06.714 --> 41:09.633
Yet we have paperwork
that says she had dementia.

41:10.676 --> 41:15.014
How is someone who is that ill
well enough to go to work?

41:22.062 --> 41:24.231
"Caution should also be exercised

41:24.315 --> 41:27.067
so as not to accelerate her return to work

41:27.151 --> 41:29.987
faster than her emotional recovery allows,

41:30.070 --> 41:34.492
lest she have a relapse that would undo
the progress she has made thus far."

41:35.201 --> 41:38.871
[Carr] The medical team said
that Britney lacked capacity,

41:38.954 --> 41:42.708
but who was the original doctor
that made that decision?

41:42.791 --> 41:45.878
In looking at the publicly available
court documents,

41:45.961 --> 41:49.298
there was only one name
listed in the initial evaluation,

41:49.381 --> 41:51.509
a Dr. J. Edward Spar.

41:52.259 --> 41:54.762
I needed to confirm that he was the doctor

41:54.845 --> 41:59.433
that conducted the medical evaluation
that kept the conservatorship in place.

41:59.517 --> 42:00.518
We're ready for slate.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.436
And what the justification was.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.355
[woman] Dr. James, uh…

42:04.438 --> 42:05.856
-Spar.
-[woman] Spar.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.650
Take one, mark.

42:07.733 --> 42:08.734
[man] Thank you.

42:09.735 --> 42:12.279
[Carr] Dr. Spar, tell me about your work.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.533
I am a retired, uh, geriatric psychiatrist

42:15.616 --> 42:19.286
and still do the occasional consultation
for attorneys,

42:19.370 --> 42:23.165
including, you know,
contested conservatorships sometimes.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.918
[Carr] Had you heard of
Britney Spears' music before you met her?

42:26.001 --> 42:30.130
You know, uh, I'm not a fan.
I don't listen to music of that ilk.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.174
But, yeah, I know who she is.

42:33.509 --> 42:35.469
-Wait, before I met her?
-Yeah.

42:35.553 --> 42:39.181
Oh, wait, I'm not going to acknowledge
that I've ever met her.

42:39.723 --> 42:42.101
[Carr] Do you specialize in dementia?

42:42.184 --> 42:44.270
Well, I'm a geriatric psychiatrist,

42:44.353 --> 42:47.690
so that's one of the things
that geriatric psychiatrists

42:47.773 --> 42:50.067
spend a lot of time and energy on, yeah.

42:50.150 --> 42:53.571
Is that why you were brought in
to evaluate Britney Spears?

42:55.114 --> 43:00.411
I'm not going to verify that I was ever
brought in to evaluate Britney Spears.

43:00.494 --> 43:02.454
So here is a court document

43:02.538 --> 43:05.249
that said, uh,
"According to Dr. Spar's declaration."

43:06.834 --> 43:10.713
Okay. Again, show me
my signed declaration.

43:11.880 --> 43:16.635
If you show me a public document
with my signature on it,

43:16.719 --> 43:19.013
I will verify my signature.

43:19.096 --> 43:22.850
Other than that, I'm not gonna talk about

43:22.933 --> 43:27.187
whether anybody ever retained me
to see anybody, not just Britney Spears.

43:27.271 --> 43:29.440
These are confidential evaluations.

43:29.523 --> 43:31.525
[Carr] But you think, for the most part,

43:31.609 --> 43:35.988
that conservatorships are, um,
mostly to help people?

43:37.031 --> 43:39.617
The ones where I have been involved,

43:39.700 --> 43:42.411
the person who's filing
for the conservatorship

43:42.494 --> 43:44.663
believes that they are acting
in the interests

43:44.747 --> 43:46.665
of their proposed conservatee.

43:46.749 --> 43:49.460
They're trying to protect them
from something.

43:49.543 --> 43:52.129
Usually,
most of the cases I've been involved in,

43:52.212 --> 43:54.173
what they're trying to protect them from

43:54.256 --> 43:57.885
is a predatory individual
after that person's money.

43:57.968 --> 43:59.970
[somber music playing]

44:06.560 --> 44:09.521
[Ghalib]
I get a phone call from her father.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.775
And he's like,
"I need you to come home right now."

44:12.858 --> 44:15.486
I said, "We'll come home
when we come home."

44:16.070 --> 44:18.280
And he said,
"No, you need to bring her home now."

44:18.364 --> 44:21.450
"I'm the conservator of her estate."

44:23.202 --> 44:25.913
You know, he was always so extreme.
You know?

44:30.376 --> 44:34.713
Let me explain to you
how fucking devastating it was

44:34.797 --> 44:38.175
for me to pull up at the gates

44:38.258 --> 44:40.552
and there's her father standing there,

44:40.636 --> 44:43.722
four of the security, and two officers.

44:44.306 --> 44:47.768
And they're standing there,
and she freaks out.

44:47.851 --> 44:49.853
"What are they doing here?
Why are they here?"

44:49.937 --> 44:52.690
"Why is my father at my house? Who are
these people? Why are the cops here?"

44:52.773 --> 44:54.149
And she looks at me.

44:54.900 --> 44:58.112
I'm supposed to be the one
that protects her.

44:59.196 --> 45:01.699
And I'm trying to calm her down. I cannot.

45:01.782 --> 45:05.828
I'm trying to explain to her,
"He is your conservator."

45:05.911 --> 45:11.166
"Without his permission,
because he is you, I've kidnapped you."

45:11.792 --> 45:13.502
"And it's that real."

45:13.585 --> 45:16.922
She just looks. She doesn't talk anymore.
She's completely silent.

45:20.759 --> 45:23.178
You know, they escort her into the house.

45:25.347 --> 45:27.266
That's when the realization was,

45:27.349 --> 45:30.227
"Okay, I don't think
things are gonna be the same."

45:44.658 --> 45:46.660
[camera shutter clicking]

45:47.911 --> 45:51.457
[Carr] As 2008 continued,
Britney had reportedly negotiated

45:51.540 --> 45:54.168
50-50 custody of her kids.

45:54.251 --> 45:56.587
The amount of time she spent with them

45:56.670 --> 46:00.299
was subject to the approval
of her dad and conservator, Jamie.

46:01.300 --> 46:03.302
[indistinct chatter]

46:06.054 --> 46:08.182
Britney seemed to be recovering
from the events

46:08.265 --> 46:10.476
that led to her hospitalization.

46:10.559 --> 46:13.562
It was deemed by Britney, Inc.
that it was time to work,

46:13.645 --> 46:14.855
and work she did.

46:15.731 --> 46:17.733
[indistinct chatter]

46:20.736 --> 46:23.071
It started with recording a new album,

46:23.155 --> 46:26.700
and then the idea
of a tell-all documentary was proposed.

46:26.784 --> 46:29.536
This MTV Film would be called
For the Record.

46:30.204 --> 46:32.956
This was a new time
in Britney's professional life,

46:33.040 --> 46:36.126
and it meant those that worked with her
would be carefully selected

46:36.210 --> 46:37.753
by the conservatorship.

46:38.670 --> 46:42.674
It was interesting going through
a lot of this with other creatives

46:42.758 --> 46:45.135
and people who were sort of
from the outside.

46:45.219 --> 46:47.262
I remember at one point talking amongst us

46:47.346 --> 46:50.599
and realizing that, like,
there wasn't a single person

46:50.682 --> 46:52.893
that was involved with that project

46:52.976 --> 46:57.481
that didn't come out
feeling affected emotionally.

46:58.023 --> 46:59.566
Like, not a single person.

47:00.108 --> 47:02.694
[Britney] If I wasn't under the restraints
that I'm under right now,

47:02.778 --> 47:08.075
with all the lawyers and doctors
and people analyzing me every day

47:08.158 --> 47:09.576
and all that kind of stuff,

47:09.660 --> 47:15.833
like, if that wasn't there, I'd feel
so liberated and feel like myself.

47:15.916 --> 47:19.127
It's like… It's bad.

47:19.211 --> 47:21.213
[somber music playing]

47:28.011 --> 47:29.346
I'm sad.

47:31.932 --> 47:34.309
[Jamie] The best thing for her is
what she's doing right now.

47:34.393 --> 47:37.646
Let's give her…
She's in her element. She's in her world.

47:37.729 --> 47:42.651
And, uh, keeping her busy.
You know, like me, I like to go fishing.

47:42.734 --> 47:45.487
She likes to sing and dance.
She likes to work.

47:45.571 --> 47:47.573
Are they gonna bring
something here or something?

47:47.656 --> 47:51.118
-I have no idea what's going on.
-Yes, you do, brat.

47:52.870 --> 47:54.872
-Does everybody know what we're doing?
-[man] Yep.

47:54.955 --> 47:56.456
-Except me.
-[man] Except you.

47:56.540 --> 47:57.666
Is that my car?

47:59.126 --> 48:01.920
[Gallery] I was there that day,
and I remember,

48:02.004 --> 48:06.967
like with almost everything, there were
these two polar opposite feelings.

48:07.050 --> 48:10.262
Like, it was so nice for her
to get to drive her car

48:10.345 --> 48:13.682
with the top down
and just feel free for a minute.

48:13.765 --> 48:17.853
But on the other hand, I'm thinking,
like, what is going on with this girl

48:17.936 --> 48:20.397
that we have to arrange…

48:20.480 --> 48:23.066
Thirty people have
to arrange this whole thing

48:23.150 --> 48:27.738
to let her drive her car
to feel free for 30 minutes?

48:28.447 --> 48:30.657
Like, in what context?

48:30.741 --> 48:36.496
Like… Like, how is that
how she gets to feel free?

48:37.748 --> 48:40.250
The whole thing is fucked up. I'm sorry.

48:42.377 --> 48:44.713
[crowd cheering]

48:46.465 --> 48:48.342
Britney and I had become close.

48:48.967 --> 48:53.138
I could shoot her in a way that not
all the other camera people could.

48:53.221 --> 48:57.184
Um, and so then we just developed
this sort of close-knit friendship.

48:59.186 --> 49:01.939
There were times she'd ask me for help,

49:02.022 --> 49:04.983
whether it was questions
about legal issues

49:05.067 --> 49:09.237
or, you know,
stuff about conservatorships.

49:09.321 --> 49:12.658
Um, and I would usually try
and deflect these things

49:12.741 --> 49:14.826
because if I didn't have an answer,

49:14.910 --> 49:17.496
I didn't want to give her
any wrong information.

49:17.579 --> 49:21.708
Um, but I know that there were times
that she did want to speak out

49:21.792 --> 49:24.586
and address things
and wasn't really able to.

49:28.548 --> 49:30.342
This People article came out.

49:30.425 --> 49:34.221
I think they had interviewed Kevin
and obviously talked about Britney.

49:34.304 --> 49:37.516
And there was stuff
she didn't really agree with.

49:37.599 --> 49:40.477
And it's like she wanted to respond to it.

49:40.560 --> 49:44.564
And so, yeah, she wrote this letter
and she gave it to me

49:44.648 --> 49:48.110
and she was like,
"Can you read this on TV?"

49:49.987 --> 49:53.824
"What happened to Britney was a year ago
and people need to get with the times."

49:53.907 --> 49:56.618
"And as for Kevin
saying Britney divorced him,

49:56.702 --> 50:00.080
she was forced to by her lawyers
because she went to visit him in New York,

50:00.163 --> 50:01.957
and he wouldn't see her and the children."

50:02.040 --> 50:05.919
"And her lawyer said if she doesn't
divorce him, he's gonna do it himself."

50:06.003 --> 50:09.715
"So, Kevin trying to play
the innocent victim is hardly irrelevant."

50:09.798 --> 50:11.717
"He left her and the babies."

50:12.259 --> 50:14.219
"Her going on the mend,
partying two years ago,

50:14.302 --> 50:16.847
has nothing to do with the situation now."

50:16.930 --> 50:21.059
"She's a different person, and most
of their fighting was done back then

50:21.143 --> 50:25.772
because of his problem waking and baking
to marijuana at 5:00 in the morning."

50:26.815 --> 50:29.943
"No one talks about these things
because no one knows the truth."

50:30.652 --> 50:32.279
"She was lied to and set up."

50:32.946 --> 50:35.699
"Her children were taken away
and she did spin out of control,

50:35.782 --> 50:38.452
which any mother would
in those circumstances."

50:39.286 --> 50:44.124
"This year, Britney's been silenced to
speak out about anything that's going on."

50:44.207 --> 50:48.295
"The people controlling her life
have made $3 million this year."

50:48.837 --> 50:51.214
"She would love for new eyes
to see her situation,

50:51.298 --> 50:53.633
but if she brings it up,
she's constantly threatened

50:53.717 --> 50:56.470
that the conservators
will take her kids away."

50:56.553 --> 50:58.555
"So how long does this go on for?"

50:59.389 --> 51:02.225
"As long as the people are getting paid
and she has no rights,

51:02.309 --> 51:06.021
it could go on for a while,
but it doesn't make it right at all."

51:08.148 --> 51:11.276
"Britney's given her brother
a $2 million apartment,

51:11.359 --> 51:13.236
her mother an estate in Louisiana,

51:13.320 --> 51:16.031
and her father
the best job in show business."

51:16.531 --> 51:20.911
"She's a very giving person and would love
to get the respect she deserves."

51:24.331 --> 51:26.875
It was an emotional response
to the article coming out,

51:26.958 --> 51:29.711
and it is like her first response.

51:29.795 --> 51:32.380
For me not to read it all on TV
right away was also saying,

51:32.464 --> 51:36.093
why don't you just take a couple days
and cool down from this?

51:36.176 --> 51:39.554
And then a couple days later,
maybe we can revisit it.

51:40.180 --> 51:43.391
Things like this would happen often,
not necessarily like this letter,

51:43.475 --> 51:46.937
but like trying to use my phone
to call people.

51:47.020 --> 51:50.649
Those are the things you had
to look out for and steer her away from.

51:51.399 --> 51:54.945
And then, a couple days later,
I got a phone call from the lawyers.

51:55.028 --> 51:59.491
The letter had some, you know,
some information that would be really bad

51:59.574 --> 52:01.993
if it came out or something like that.

52:02.077 --> 52:06.081
And so, all of a sudden, the letter turned
into a much bigger thing.

52:06.665 --> 52:11.128
And then, you know, I just brought it in
and showed it to them, and that was that.

52:11.211 --> 52:14.297
[Carr] But you had enough foresight
to copy the letter?

52:15.048 --> 52:16.424
I wouldn't call it foresight.

52:16.508 --> 52:20.345
I think that when she gave it to me,
we took a picture of it

52:20.428 --> 52:23.890
because I didn't want
to actually carry the letter.

52:23.974 --> 52:26.268
And what was that experience like for you?

52:28.186 --> 52:31.022
I mean, again, like,
I always just felt bad for her.

52:33.358 --> 52:37.154
I felt bad that, like,
this was her reality and her world,

52:37.863 --> 52:41.032
where she gave me a letter,
and then, all of a sudden,

52:41.116 --> 52:43.702
this huge fire alarm goes off.

52:45.996 --> 52:50.917
It's crazy. All she wanted to do
was respond to an article.

52:51.001 --> 52:54.087
[Carr] How much longer did you work
with Britney after that?

52:54.921 --> 52:59.968
It was pretty shortly after that
that I stopped working with her.

53:00.051 --> 53:05.849
I think at that point it was obvious that
we were close and pretty good friends.

53:05.932 --> 53:07.017
Um…

53:07.100 --> 53:11.605
I mean, this was coming after I was
her date for her brother's wedding.

53:11.688 --> 53:16.735
And, you know, we had developed,
you know, I think just like a good trust.

53:16.818 --> 53:20.530
And maybe we were too close at that point.

53:21.448 --> 53:24.242
And so, yeah,
shortly after that, I got removed.

53:27.204 --> 53:31.666
I actually… I don't think
I've spoken to her since.

53:36.630 --> 53:39.591
And Britney had met a bunch of my friends.

53:39.674 --> 53:44.721
You know? She had, you know,
like sort of come into my life.

53:44.804 --> 53:50.435
And, you know, it was just sad to think
that she was gonna be alone again.

53:56.107 --> 53:58.109
[pensive music playing]

54:33.520 --> 54:37.565
[Eliscu] In January of 2009,
I went to L.A. for the winter,

54:38.066 --> 54:40.318
and I had made contact with Sam Lutfi.

54:41.152 --> 54:44.990
He'd been a good background source
for the Rolling Stone cover story,

54:45.073 --> 54:47.867
and we had kept in touch
even after it came out.

54:48.451 --> 54:51.705
Then he told me about the fact
that he and Adnan had been trying

54:51.788 --> 54:55.959
to come up with a plan
to help her find a different lawyer.

54:57.585 --> 55:01.631
She still, in January of 2009,

55:01.715 --> 55:06.052
still wanted a different lawyer
if she could get one.

55:06.136 --> 55:09.556
This was a full year
of the conservatorship

55:09.639 --> 55:11.766
supposedly having saved her life.

55:12.851 --> 55:15.061
They had been talking to different lawyers

55:15.145 --> 55:19.107
who thought that if they could get her
to sign this document

55:19.190 --> 55:23.570
saying why she wanted a new lawyer
and why she wanted the specific lawyer

55:23.653 --> 55:26.740
that that would be something
that would just have to happen then

55:26.823 --> 55:29.868
and there would be no way to refute it.

55:31.244 --> 55:34.456
At that time, Sam and Adnan
were persona non grata.

55:34.539 --> 55:38.335
They had been completely forbidden
from having access to Britney.

55:39.294 --> 55:41.463
And within days of me arriving in L.A.,

55:41.546 --> 55:44.883
Sam started talking about trying
to get her to sign this thing

55:44.966 --> 55:47.344
and trying to find someone
who might get her to sign.

55:48.386 --> 55:54.059
I can't say there was a specific moment
that convinced me to do it.

55:54.601 --> 55:58.521
Of course, I was concerned about being
a participant in the story

55:58.605 --> 56:01.316
I was trying to cover objectively.

56:01.399 --> 56:06.279
But, at that point, I had known
Britney Spears for a decade almost,

56:06.363 --> 56:12.660
so I cared about her in a human way that
there was no denying it at that point,

56:12.744 --> 56:17.082
that I could be more useful
as a Good Samaritan almost

56:17.165 --> 56:21.211
than another journalist trying
to cover the story.

56:21.294 --> 56:23.963
[man] Anything to say
about the conservatorship today?

56:24.464 --> 56:28.968
[Eliscu] Sam explained to me
that I would need to go to the Montage

56:29.052 --> 56:31.930
and she would be waiting for me.

56:32.013 --> 56:35.225
And she would know
to come meet me in the bathroom.

56:36.935 --> 56:39.771
I just walked in thinking,
"Pretend I'm a guest."

56:39.854 --> 56:45.110
I took the elevator up and I walked out
and I saw Edon, her security guard,

56:45.193 --> 56:48.613
up there and maybe one other,
like, security-looking dude.

56:49.364 --> 56:53.952
She was just in the pool by herself.
Just leaning on the edge of the pool.

56:54.035 --> 56:58.123
Um, and I kind of gave her
a little side-eye and saw her see me,

56:58.206 --> 57:01.084
and then went into this small bathroom.

57:01.167 --> 57:05.630
I went into the stall, closed the door,
and got the papers and the pen ready,

57:05.713 --> 57:09.217
and saw her tattoo
on her foot or ankle or whatever it is,

57:09.300 --> 57:15.140
and opened the door and I showed her
the spots where she needed to sign.

57:15.223 --> 57:18.393
And she signed and looked at me
and said, "Thank you."

57:18.476 --> 57:19.686
And I said…

57:30.196 --> 57:33.533
I said, "I'll see you again. Go."

57:36.161 --> 57:41.040
Yeah, she definitely seemed scared.
It was hard to tell 'cause I was scared.

57:42.000 --> 57:46.963
But she was appreciative, which was,
like, such classic kind of her vibe to be,

57:47.046 --> 57:50.133
in that moment to be scared
but to also be grateful, you know?

57:50.216 --> 57:52.218
[eerie music playing]

58:32.884 --> 58:35.512
I thought the documents were
gonna be delivered right away.

58:35.595 --> 58:39.432
I was told there would be
an ex parte hearing to address this,

58:39.516 --> 58:40.808
but then days passed

58:40.892 --> 58:45.438
and Britney was supposed
to go on a trip somewhere with her dad.

58:45.522 --> 58:48.775
And we thought that when he sees
that she signed it,

58:48.858 --> 58:51.236
he'll know that things are gonna change.

58:52.278 --> 58:55.615
I couldn't believe it when I found out,
about a week later,

58:55.698 --> 59:01.579
that it was all over and that, similar to
what had happened with Adam Streisand,

59:01.663 --> 59:03.331
that it had been ruled

59:03.414 --> 59:07.252
that she lacked
the capacity to choose a lawyer

59:07.335 --> 59:11.881
and that they had cast enough doubt
on to whether that was her signature.

59:14.259 --> 59:16.052
I never heard anything of it again.

59:16.636 --> 59:18.930
No one ever talked about it again,

59:20.014 --> 59:23.351
and still no one really talks
about the fact

59:23.434 --> 59:27.564
that there was another attempt
to get a lawyer

59:27.647 --> 59:29.399
that somehow didn't work out.

59:31.442 --> 59:35.113
[Carr] But someone else knew
about the incident at the Montage.

59:35.196 --> 59:39.993
Seven days after Britney signed the papers
saying she wanted new representation,

59:40.076 --> 59:43.413
the court-appointed lawyer
for the conservatorship, Sam Ingham,

59:43.496 --> 59:46.791
stated that Britney told him
she'd met with a reporter

59:46.874 --> 59:51.296
from Rolling Stone to sign documents
about acquiring new counsel.

59:54.132 --> 59:56.926
He went on to say,
"Britney does not wish to do that,"

59:57.010 --> 1:00:01.055
and asked him to do whatever is necessary
to "squash the document."

1:00:01.139 --> 1:00:03.099
She further stated that she was,

1:00:03.182 --> 1:00:06.728
"Fully satisfied
with my representation of her."

1:00:08.187 --> 1:00:13.067
That same day, the attorney she had tried
to hire, John Anderson, withdrew, stating,

1:00:13.151 --> 1:00:17.780
"I can say no more; will do no more."
And, "That is the end for me."

1:00:19.449 --> 1:00:23.745
It was another time that Britney had tried
to seek her own representation

1:00:23.828 --> 1:00:25.496
and it failed.

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:32.211
[Chicotel] It's the conservatee's attorney
is the one person in this system

1:00:32.295 --> 1:00:36.549
who is tasked with making
the conservatee's best case

1:00:36.633 --> 1:00:38.718
for whatever the conservatee wants.

1:00:38.801 --> 1:00:41.804
I've seen so many instances
where those attorneys

1:00:41.888 --> 1:00:44.057
are not representing
what their clients want.

1:00:45.266 --> 1:00:50.563
[Streisand] Keep in mind that the only way
that Sam Ingham gets paid

1:00:50.647 --> 1:00:54.359
is he has to file a petition
with the court,

1:00:54.442 --> 1:00:57.278
and then the conservator have
the right to object

1:00:57.362 --> 1:01:00.323
to him getting paid
or the fees he's asking for.

1:01:00.406 --> 1:01:04.118
Obviously, there is
a natural tendency to say,

1:01:04.202 --> 1:01:08.081
"Well, I certainly don't want
to be pissing off the people

1:01:08.164 --> 1:01:11.793
who are gonna have the ability
to object to me getting paid."

1:01:13.127 --> 1:01:16.172
[Carr] What is your reaction to knowing
that a court-appointed attorney

1:01:16.255 --> 1:01:20.843
is making over 3 million dollars,
like as-- In this position?

1:01:21.803 --> 1:01:25.973
My reaction is that he's on a gravy train
and he'll ride it all the way to the end.

1:01:29.310 --> 1:01:31.896
[man] Are you concerned
for Britney's mental health?

1:01:31.979 --> 1:01:33.147
[Carr] By early 2009,

1:01:33.231 --> 1:01:37.026
Jamie Spears asked that the temporary
conservatorship of his daughter

1:01:37.110 --> 1:01:38.403
be made permanent.

1:01:39.028 --> 1:01:42.573
And there was a range
of new specific powers and privileges

1:01:42.657 --> 1:01:44.826
that would be given
to the conservatorship,

1:01:46.536 --> 1:01:50.665
spanning from using funds from the estate
to pay for a car for Jamie…

1:01:51.666 --> 1:01:56.421
to giving him more complete control
over Britney's personal finances.

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:02.552
Perhaps most importantly, though,
the permanent conservatorship

1:02:02.635 --> 1:02:07.765
would allow Jamie to pursue professional
opportunities available to Britney

1:02:07.849 --> 1:02:10.518
once they're approved by her medical team.

1:02:14.439 --> 1:02:17.442
-["Circus" playing over speakers]
-[scatting]

1:02:25.825 --> 1:02:28.411
Britney was preparing for a huge tour,

1:02:28.494 --> 1:02:31.998
whatever concerns
the conservatorship's medical team had

1:02:32.081 --> 1:02:35.710
about her health and overworking
seemed to be forgotten.

1:02:39.672 --> 1:02:42.759
[Eliscu] First off, ticket sales
are going phenomenally well.

1:02:42.842 --> 1:02:47.013
Sales have generated about 40 million.

1:02:48.389 --> 1:02:51.684
Second, there seems
to be an opportunity to add two shows

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:55.772
at the end of the U.S. leg
on very attractive financial terms.

1:02:55.855 --> 1:02:58.691
So this is before the Circus tour.

1:02:59.734 --> 1:03:03.780
They don't even know yet
if she's gonna be, like, okay to tour,

1:03:03.863 --> 1:03:05.615
-but they're adding more dates.
-Right.

1:03:05.698 --> 1:03:09.577
They went from temporary conservatorship
to permanent conservatorship,

1:03:09.660 --> 1:03:11.996
and Circus was that year.

1:03:12.079 --> 1:03:17.043
So us noting that there was
financial incentives for Larry, for Jamie,

1:03:17.126 --> 1:03:22.048
for the lawyers to get her working,
A, but get her working more.

1:03:22.715 --> 1:03:24.383
[audience cheering]

1:03:25.510 --> 1:03:29.138
[Carr] The Circus tour was performed
over the course of nine months

1:03:29.222 --> 1:03:32.141
and totaled 70 shows spanning the world.

1:03:33.017 --> 1:03:36.521
[Eliscu] I've had people tell me
that there were conversations explicitly 

1:03:36.604 --> 1:03:39.315
about how quickly she could come back.

1:03:39.398 --> 1:03:41.943
They probably felt like it was important

1:03:42.026 --> 1:03:45.947
to show her looking healthy and okay
as quickly as possible

1:03:46.030 --> 1:03:49.909
to prove that what they decided to do
was the right decision.

1:03:49.992 --> 1:03:51.160
[man] Britney!

1:03:51.244 --> 1:03:52.370
Britney!

1:03:52.995 --> 1:03:56.082
[Gallery] There's nothing relaxing
about being on a tour.

1:03:58.209 --> 1:03:59.836
Flying all over the world,

1:03:59.919 --> 1:04:02.672
being in different countries
every few days.

1:04:02.755 --> 1:04:04.924
[reporter] Are you sick
of your dad being conservator?

1:04:05.007 --> 1:04:09.303
[Gallery] I can only imagine how stressful
and challenging that might be for her.

1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:17.144
Was she in the right mental state
to put all that time and energy

1:04:17.228 --> 1:04:22.316
into doing a whole--? Revamping her
entire career and doing this comeback?

1:04:25.361 --> 1:04:26.737
It's like, that's hard.

1:04:28.364 --> 1:04:32.994
We've had, on background, conversations
with people who were on the tour.

1:04:33.077 --> 1:04:37.582
They said it was a mess.
They said it was bad for Britney's health.

1:04:37.665 --> 1:04:38.833
[audience cheering]

1:04:38.916 --> 1:04:41.794
[Carr] The conservatorship stated
that they had successfully added

1:04:41.878 --> 1:04:44.922
financial growth
and stability to Britney's life.

1:04:48.259 --> 1:04:50.803
"Her main focus,
almost to the point of obsession,

1:04:50.887 --> 1:04:52.930
was getting more time with her children."

1:04:53.472 --> 1:04:57.518
"Her second preoccupation was
whether the conservatorship would end

1:04:57.602 --> 1:05:01.230
and whether her father Jamie Spears would
be more lenient with her privileges."

1:05:01.314 --> 1:05:06.861
Oh, man. She gets an allowance,
she's got "privileges,"

1:05:06.944 --> 1:05:09.655
and her daddy is in charge.

1:05:10.448 --> 1:05:11.991
That's the patriarchy.

[Britney squealing]

1:05:24.128 --> 1:05:26.839
[Carr] In 2009,
Britney had a new boyfriend.

1:05:27.506 --> 1:05:29.926
It was her agent, Jason Trawick.

1:05:32.637 --> 1:05:34.347
[Jamie] You need to go over there.

1:05:34.430 --> 1:05:37.892
If you don't go over, we're gonna leave.
Y'all ain't gonna get no pictures.

1:05:44.357 --> 1:05:45.858
[Carr] By the fall of 2011,

1:05:45.942 --> 1:05:48.778
he was featured
in Britney's music video "Criminal."

[man groans, grunts]

We both had an objective point of view

1:06:18.140 --> 1:06:22.061
because, at the time, neither of us
were dating her or engaged to her

[Eliscu] So this is from a doctor
with the conservatorship to Sam Ingham.

1:06:50.589 --> 1:06:54.218
"I had an interview
and assessment session with Jason."

1:06:54.301 --> 1:06:58.347
"I found him to be forthcoming and open,
though fearful that whatever he said

"He appears to be genuinely
in love with Britney."

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:10.818
"His philosophy is Britney will have
to learn to live without a conservator."

1:07:10.901 --> 1:07:13.612
"He feels that the present arrangement
is too constrictive."

1:07:13.696 --> 1:07:16.824
"Jason states inconveniences
Britney has to go through

1:07:16.907 --> 1:07:18.200

1:07:18.284 --> 1:07:21.829
"For example, they wanted to drive
within a gated community on a golf cart,

1:07:21.912 --> 1:07:24.373
but have to ask permission each time."

1:07:24.457 --> 1:07:27.084
"If they want to go out
to a hamburger joint,

1:07:27.168 --> 1:07:30.796
they have to call for permission and wait
20 minutes or more for an answer."

1:07:30.880 --> 1:07:34.592
"If Britney needs a few hundred dollars
to buy books for her kids,

1:07:34.675 --> 1:07:38.429
she has to ask
and wait a few days for an answer."

1:07:38.512 --> 1:07:42.183
This was right after Britney finished
the huge, giant tour.

1:07:42.266 --> 1:07:44.143
That was Femme Fatale.

1:07:45.019 --> 1:07:46.520
What the fuck?

1:07:47.146 --> 1:07:48.481
Look at the next page.

1:07:49.690 --> 1:07:51.150
"Toward the end of the tour,

1:07:51.233 --> 1:07:54.111
significant tensions arose between
Jamie Spears,

1:07:54.195 --> 1:07:56.697
Britney's father and conservator,
and Britney."

1:07:56.781 --> 1:07:58.491
[Carr] Right, and then look at this.

1:07:58.574 --> 1:08:00.910
"Britney began to complain
about Jamie's drinking."

1:08:00.993 --> 1:08:03.829
"She is especially adamant
that Jamie be punished."

1:08:03.913 --> 1:08:06.499
"This seems to be a lightning rod
for all of her complaints

1:08:06.582 --> 1:08:08.459
about the conservatorship itself."

1:08:08.542 --> 1:08:13.339
"In a simple way, she feels that
if she is drug tested, so should he be."

1:08:13.422 --> 1:08:16.926
"If she were to suffer a great penalty,
like losing her kids,

1:08:17.009 --> 1:08:18.844
if she tested positive,

1:08:18.928 --> 1:08:22.056
he should suffer an equally
great penalty for his drinking."

1:08:22.139 --> 1:08:26.977
And this is again, the most sort of,
some of the most damning stuff.

1:08:27.061 --> 1:08:29.522
"Britney wants to come off
the conservatorship."

1:08:29.605 --> 1:08:32.233

"She indicates she would go along
with the conservatorship of the estate,

1:08:40.491 --> 1:08:44.161
but mostly she wants to end
the conservatorship of the person."

1:08:46.330 --> 1:08:49.708
The conservatorship has maintained
Britney has never once asked for it

1:08:49.792 --> 1:08:52.962
to be terminated
and that if it was that bad,

1:08:53.045 --> 1:08:54.630
she would tell people about it.

she wanted out of the conservatorship,

Jason be added as her conservator.

1:09:22.032 --> 1:09:24.451
But instead of Jason replacing Jamie,

1:09:24.535 --> 1:09:27.705
the court ruled
in what could be considered a compromise.

1:09:28.414 --> 1:09:32.418
Jason Trawick and Jamie
are made co-conservators

1:09:32.501 --> 1:09:34.128
versus Jamie being removed.

1:09:34.211 --> 1:09:36.422
[Eliscu] Which just feels so weird.

1:09:36.505 --> 1:09:39.175
At the time,
I thought that it was interesting

1:09:39.258 --> 1:09:42.928
that Jamie would give over
even that small amount of control

1:09:43.012 --> 1:09:47.057
to someone theoretically new
or a non-family member.

1:09:49.143 --> 1:09:53.230
[Carr] With her father and fiancé
as co-conservators of her person,

1:09:53.314 --> 1:09:58.027
Britney inked a reported $15 million deal
to judge X Factor.

1:09:58.652 --> 1:10:01.614
Behind the scenes,
confidential reports given to us

1:10:01.697 --> 1:10:04.533
showed that the conservatorship
was in chaos.

1:10:04.617 --> 1:10:09.246
The medical team thought that X Factor
put undue pressure on Britney,

1:10:09.747 --> 1:10:13.542
whereas her management said
that withdrawing would be just as bad

1:10:13.626 --> 1:10:15.836
as a publicly observed meltdown.

1:10:15.920 --> 1:10:18.839
Under intense pressure
from Britney's management,

1:10:18.923 --> 1:10:22.843
the medical team cautiously
approved Britney's participation,

1:10:22.927 --> 1:10:28.057
but said there would be strict guidelines
for their approval to stay in place,

1:10:29.266 --> 1:10:33.395
which included that Jason Trawick's
presence was, quote, "mandatory."

1:10:34.855 --> 1:10:39.276
And then the big bombshell is
that we have direct evidence

1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:44.031
that her medication,
the medication that she liked to take,

1:10:44.114 --> 1:10:46.450
was increased if she worked.

1:10:46.533 --> 1:10:49.161
There's different dosages on,

1:10:49.245 --> 1:10:52.831
quote-unquote,
"non-work days and work days."

1:10:52.915 --> 1:10:54.124
[Carr] Look at the next page.

1:10:54.833 --> 1:10:57.002
[Eliscu] "On the one hand,
Jamie and the team

1:10:57.086 --> 1:11:00.631
valued the benefits of stimulants
for Britney's performance."

1:11:00.714 --> 1:11:05.552
"This had been the case for her tours
and for her participation on X Factor."

1:11:05.636 --> 1:11:09.765
"By the same token, Jamie wanted
Britney not to take stimulants."

1:11:11.225 --> 1:11:13.727
"This contradiction
has not been resolved."

1:11:14.687 --> 1:11:16.021
[audience cheering]

1:11:21.193 --> 1:11:22.945
[Carr] From the public's perspective,

1:11:23.028 --> 1:11:26.156
Britney's performance
on The X Factor was a success.

1:11:27.616 --> 1:11:31.578
Less than a year later, though,
Britney and Jason would break up,

1:11:31.662 --> 1:11:36.000
making Jamie the sole conservator
of the person once again.

1:11:36.083 --> 1:11:38.585
[Eliscu] "On the subject
of X Factor itself,

1:11:38.669 --> 1:11:41.880
there is estimated to be a 50-50 chance
they will invite her to return,

1:11:41.964 --> 1:11:44.258
but at this time
it appears that she would decline."

1:11:44.341 --> 1:11:48.304
"Instead, her current plan is
to create a Las Vegas-style revue

1:11:48.387 --> 1:11:52.099
to perform at a Las Vegas hotel
over three- or four-day weekend dates

1:11:52.182 --> 1:11:53.559
once or twice a month."

1:11:53.642 --> 1:11:55.019
What does it say right after that?

1:11:55.102 --> 1:11:57.271
"I believe this is
an appropriate career move

1:11:57.354 --> 1:11:59.773
from the perspective
of her psychiatric condition."

1:11:59.857 --> 1:12:01.567
-[audience cheering]
-It's so hot.

1:12:02.318 --> 1:12:04.445
Okay, so…

1:12:05.321 --> 1:12:08.657
being single for a year…

1:12:09.783 --> 1:12:10.617
Yeah!

1:12:11.368 --> 1:12:14.830
…has been very, very, very profound.

1:12:15.497 --> 1:12:20.044
And I feel like
all men should suck my toe.

1:12:20.586 --> 1:12:24.006
[Carr] Britney's Vegas residency
started in 2013,

1:12:24.089 --> 1:12:26.008
and it was called Piece of Me.

1:12:26.091 --> 1:12:30.304
The show would span five years
and culminate in a world tour.

1:12:30.387 --> 1:12:33.932
Very little is known about
Britney's life during this time period.

1:12:34.016 --> 1:12:37.311
The conservatorship kept
her inner circle very small.

1:12:37.936 --> 1:12:40.022
Candid Britney interviews were rare.

1:12:40.105 --> 1:12:43.442
Unguarded public moments
only seemed to happen

1:12:43.525 --> 1:12:45.861
when she was talking to her audience.

1:12:45.944 --> 1:12:50.240
Honestly, without the music,
just the mic, it kind of feels illegal.

1:12:50.324 --> 1:12:53.077
Like it's quiet right now, and it--

1:12:53.911 --> 1:12:57.831
It feels kind of illegal doing this
with this mic in my hand now.

1:12:57.915 --> 1:12:59.291
It feels so weird.

1:12:59.375 --> 1:13:03.796
Okay, so the press and the media,
my whole life, it's really crazy,

1:13:03.879 --> 1:13:08.008
'cause one minute they tear you down
and they're really horrible,

1:13:08.092 --> 1:13:10.969
and the next minute,
you're on top of the world you know?

1:13:11.595 --> 1:13:13.639
But I just want to make sure

1:13:13.722 --> 1:13:17.393
I keep handing you motherfuckers
something to talk about, okay?

1:13:17.476 --> 1:13:19.478
[audience cheering]

1:13:19.561 --> 1:13:21.980
[upbeat music starts playing]

1:13:22.064 --> 1:13:24.191
[Carr] What was it like going
to the Vegas show?

1:13:24.274 --> 1:13:27.694
[Baron] When she found out I was there,
she wanted to see me backstage.

1:13:27.778 --> 1:13:33.867
And it was like we both just immediately
just embraced and just cried,

1:13:33.951 --> 1:13:36.578
just sat there and cried and locked arms.

1:13:36.662 --> 1:13:39.331
We hadn't seen each other in years,
hadn't spoken.

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:43.460
And when I saw her,
it's like something in her eyes,

1:13:43.544 --> 1:13:46.380
it was like the old Britney,
I guess you can say.

1:13:46.463 --> 1:13:50.801
It was as if we were right back
to where we were many, many years before.

1:13:50.884 --> 1:13:53.720
I think that's why
we both broke down and cried.

1:13:53.804 --> 1:13:56.515
And her bodyguard
walked me back to my seat,

1:13:56.598 --> 1:13:59.685
and he said to me,
I remember this, he said, um…

1:14:00.519 --> 1:14:03.313
He goes, "I don't know
what you just did to her

1:14:03.397 --> 1:14:07.151
and what your relationship was like,
but can you come back more?"

1:14:07.234 --> 1:14:11.071
"In the nine years I've worked for her,
I've never seen her smile like that."

1:14:12.865 --> 1:14:16.368
There aren't a lot of people in her life
that are from those days.

1:14:16.452 --> 1:14:19.246
It's myself, Felicia
and a couple other people.

1:14:22.583 --> 1:14:26.545
I got called back to do Circus Tour,
Femme Fatale,

1:14:26.628 --> 1:14:28.672
and then the four years in Vegas.

1:14:28.755 --> 1:14:31.341
I had much less contact with her.

1:14:31.425 --> 1:14:34.720
But I made sure, every show,
she knew I was there.

1:14:34.803 --> 1:14:37.431
[Carr] And then did she continue
to love performing?

1:14:37.514 --> 1:14:39.475
I mean, it's such an intense schedule.

1:14:39.558 --> 1:14:42.269
What was her relationship like
with performing?

1:14:45.189 --> 1:14:46.857
Britney loved performing.

1:14:47.357 --> 1:14:50.652
Hands down,
still to this second, loves performing.

1:14:51.820 --> 1:14:52.821
Um…

1:14:53.489 --> 1:14:56.492
I think that's probably as much
as I can say about that.

1:14:57.159 --> 1:14:57.993
[softly] Sorry.

1:14:58.535 --> 1:15:01.914
I don't want to fight with them.
It's not worth it to me.

1:15:02.581 --> 1:15:03.582
I'm sorry.

1:15:05.083 --> 1:15:07.419
[ominous music playing]

1:15:07.503 --> 1:15:11.882
[Carr] The one thing we know for sure
is that Britney worked almost nonstop

1:15:11.965 --> 1:15:14.676
and made other people a lot of money.

1:15:59.263 --> 1:16:04.101
[announcer] All right, everyone. We are
here to welcome the new queen of Vegas!

1:16:04.184 --> 1:16:08.981
[Carr] In January 2019, Britney announced
a new Vegas residency.

1:16:09.064 --> 1:16:11.275
It would be called Domination.

1:16:11.358 --> 1:16:13.151
[audience cheering]

1:16:14.736 --> 1:16:18.073
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen, Britney Spears!

1:16:18.156 --> 1:16:20.576
[Carr]
When she walked down the red carpet,

1:16:20.659 --> 1:16:23.620
it felt like she was almost
about to say something.

1:16:23.704 --> 1:16:24.997
But then she didn't.

1:16:27.791 --> 1:16:29.960
Three months later, via Instagram,

1:16:30.544 --> 1:16:34.172
Britney would cancel the show,
citing family health concerns.

1:16:35.299 --> 1:16:37.134
And the world was watching.

1:16:38.760 --> 1:16:43.932
That was a huge moment when
the fan community began to suspect

1:16:44.016 --> 1:16:47.978
that something weird was going on in 2019.

1:16:48.061 --> 1:16:52.899
There was even, like, missing posters
being shared around social media.

1:16:52.983 --> 1:16:56.028
Kind of as a joke, but also like
we literally haven't seen her

1:16:56.111 --> 1:16:58.071
in, like, weeks, if not months.

1:16:58.155 --> 1:17:00.949
And cut to April 2019,

1:17:01.033 --> 1:17:06.330
we find out that Britney was placed into
a mental health facility against her will.

1:17:06.413 --> 1:17:11.043
That's what is believed, and she was being
given medication she did not wanna take.

1:17:12.169 --> 1:17:16.506
I know that there are a lot of voices

1:17:16.590 --> 1:17:19.343
I've heard from many different quarters

1:17:19.426 --> 1:17:24.598
that Britney is being held as a prisoner,
in effect, against her will.

1:17:25.182 --> 1:17:29.311
And when I've been asked
do I think that's accurate,

1:17:29.978 --> 1:17:33.774
I think you have to say to yourself

1:17:33.857 --> 1:17:39.988
it's not as if Los Angeles is
some type of fascist gulag,

1:17:40.072 --> 1:17:43.283
where, in order to get a message
to the outside world,

1:17:43.367 --> 1:17:47.537
you have to write it down
on a piece of birch bark and in code,

1:17:47.621 --> 1:17:51.958
then throw it over an electrified fence
to an unsuspecting gardener.

1:17:52.042 --> 1:17:55.879
If she wanted to get a message out
as far as being held against her will,

1:17:55.962 --> 1:17:59.675
I can't even imagine
the numbers of ways she can do that.

1:18:00.467 --> 1:18:04.971
[Carr] Eventually, Britney resurfaced
via an Instagram video.

1:18:05.555 --> 1:18:09.893
Hi, guys. Just checking in with all of you
who are concerned. All is well.

1:18:09.976 --> 1:18:13.021
My family has been going through
a lot of stress and anxiety lately,

1:18:13.105 --> 1:18:17.192
so I just needed time to deal.
Don't worry, I'll be back very soon.

1:18:17.693 --> 1:18:20.862
[Carr] The video only increased
public speculation.

1:18:21.363 --> 1:18:24.199
What was going on
inside the conservatorship,

1:18:24.282 --> 1:18:27.494
and why was she in one
if she was, quote, "okay"?

1:18:37.212 --> 1:18:39.881
[Eliscu] We know that in summer of 2019,

1:18:39.965 --> 1:18:44.511
after there was already beginning to be
some chaos in the conservatorship

1:18:44.594 --> 1:18:48.390
for the first time in more than a decade,
that there was an incident

1:18:48.473 --> 1:18:52.728
where a confrontation occurred
between Jamie and one of Britney's sons.

1:18:52.811 --> 1:18:56.440
And Kevin Federline, you know,
his father and Britney's ex,

1:18:56.523 --> 1:18:58.483
had a restraining order filed
against Jamie,

1:18:58.567 --> 1:19:02.738
such that he's not allowed
to be in the presence of the children

1:19:02.821 --> 1:19:05.699
for a specified period of years.

1:19:05.782 --> 1:19:08.827
[Carr] What's been in public record
is there was an altercation,

1:19:08.910 --> 1:19:12.539
a door was broken down,
one of her sons was shaken.

1:19:13.415 --> 1:19:19.296
Um, the restraining order was based
on an unauthorized--

1:19:20.005 --> 1:19:23.550
Uh, let's just say
it had to do with conduct

1:19:23.633 --> 1:19:26.720
that put the children
in fear of their safety.

1:19:26.845 --> 1:19:28.638
How did a door get broken?

1:19:29.306 --> 1:19:30.140
Um…

1:19:31.349 --> 1:19:34.311
I think a door was slammed in some regard,

1:19:34.394 --> 1:19:38.774
and, uh, it caused the door to come off
the hinge or something in that regard.

1:19:39.441 --> 1:19:41.443
[ominous music playing]

1:19:47.783 --> 1:19:49.743
[Carr] At the end of 2019,

1:19:49.826 --> 1:19:53.038
Lou Taylor resurfaced in court documents.

1:19:53.121 --> 1:19:56.583
She had e-mailed Jamie,
saying her company, Tri Star,

1:19:56.666 --> 1:20:01.129
had lost $400,000 in billing in 2019

1:20:01.213 --> 1:20:03.799
for work as Britney's business manager.

1:20:03.882 --> 1:20:07.761
She requested a minimum of $500,000.

1:20:09.846 --> 1:20:12.724
Yet it was a time
when Britney wasn't working.

1:20:14.810 --> 1:20:17.312
When Jamie was sent a bill
the month later,

1:20:17.395 --> 1:20:19.231
he paid the funds the next day.

1:20:22.776 --> 1:20:27.656
This is what Jamie Spears, in July 2020,

1:20:27.739 --> 1:20:30.408
said of Britney Spears,

1:20:30.492 --> 1:20:32.994
of the conservatorship
and the need for it.

1:20:34.246 --> 1:20:35.497
Why don't we do here?

1:20:36.540 --> 1:20:40.293
"James P. Spears respectfully submits
this status update

1:20:40.377 --> 1:20:44.381
to provide information in advance of
and regarding some of the topics

1:20:44.464 --> 1:20:46.508
that were addressed at the last hearing."

1:20:46.591 --> 1:20:51.972
"The conservatee, Britney, has refused
to engage in any business activities,

1:20:52.055 --> 1:20:56.017
including making a non-performing
appearance at a local pop-up store

1:20:56.101 --> 1:20:59.312
dedicated to the conservatee,
where minimal effort was required,

1:20:59.396 --> 1:21:03.191
resulting in the estate being required
to refund the advance it had received

1:21:03.275 --> 1:21:05.569
in the amount of $1 million."

1:21:05.652 --> 1:21:07.612
[Carr] "The conservatee's lack
of cooperation

1:21:07.696 --> 1:21:09.155
in her own financial well-being

1:21:09.239 --> 1:21:12.701
and preservation of her continued stature
as an iconic artist

1:21:12.784 --> 1:21:15.036
has deteriorated rather than improved."

1:21:15.120 --> 1:21:17.080
"As a result
of the conservatee's trajectory,

1:21:17.163 --> 1:21:19.666
Mr. Spears has been working
to establish a model

1:21:19.749 --> 1:21:22.878
where Ms. Spear's
current lifestyle can be preserved

1:21:22.961 --> 1:21:26.548
and her needs met
based solely on passive income."

1:21:26.631 --> 1:21:28.592
"Given the state of the economy

1:21:28.675 --> 1:21:31.094
and this enormous cost
of maintaining her lifestyle,

1:21:31.177 --> 1:21:32.929
this is a tall order."

1:21:33.013 --> 1:21:36.016
Her lifestyle,
which includes all these legal bills.

1:21:42.105 --> 1:21:45.483
All of these interviews
and all of these hours talking to her

1:21:45.567 --> 1:21:49.696
and describing her
and criticizing her and limiting her,

1:21:49.779 --> 1:21:53.950
and none of this led to anything.

1:21:54.034 --> 1:21:55.535
It just all stayed the same.

1:21:55.619 --> 1:21:59.998
They could go into court a million times,
keep doing hearing after hearing,

1:22:00.081 --> 1:22:02.918
filing after filing,
and analysis after analysis,

1:22:03.001 --> 1:22:06.922
and never change anything,
and she's still in this situation.

1:22:07.881 --> 1:22:09.591
-How do you get out?
-I just--

1:22:10.258 --> 1:22:12.928
You don't get out until you scream.

1:22:13.011 --> 1:22:15.013
[emotional music playing]

1:22:31.655 --> 1:22:34.866
[Carr] If you were able to speak to her,
what would you tell her?

1:22:34.950 --> 1:22:36.076
What would you say?

1:22:36.660 --> 1:22:38.370
[Gallery] I feel like,
maybe I'd apologize.

1:22:38.453 --> 1:22:40.956
I feel like I didn't, you know, do enough,

1:22:41.039 --> 1:22:44.042
and maybe I would just… let her know

1:22:44.125 --> 1:22:47.545
that I felt bad about
not being able to help more.

1:22:48.838 --> 1:22:52.217
I don't understand how the legal system
has let this go on for so long.

1:22:52.300 --> 1:22:56.972
Maybe it's like the first one of its kind
and they don't know how to handle it,

1:22:57.055 --> 1:22:59.683
but it seems like it's an epic fail
of the legal system

1:22:59.766 --> 1:23:02.018
that this has gone on for so long

1:23:02.102 --> 1:23:04.813
and that there's been no resolution even.

1:23:04.896 --> 1:23:06.731
It just seems like it keeps getting worse.

1:23:11.361 --> 1:23:16.366
It feels like something's gonna happen.
Definitely, something's gonna happen.

1:23:17.701 --> 1:23:19.703
-[man] What do we want?
-[crowd] Free Britney!

1:23:19.786 --> 1:23:21.287
-[man] When do we want it?
-[crowd] Now!

1:23:21.371 --> 1:23:23.206
-[man] What do we want?
-[crowd] Free Britney!

1:23:23.289 --> 1:23:25.458
-[man] When do we want it?
-[crowd] Now!

1:23:26.001 --> 1:23:27.002
So you're in?

1:23:27.877 --> 1:23:29.087
It's not playing anything.

1:23:30.130 --> 1:23:31.715
It's 4:30. [laughs]

1:23:31.798 --> 1:23:33.425
[groans]

1:23:35.301 --> 1:23:37.470
[Carr] This is us trying
to get into the court hearing.

1:23:37.554 --> 1:23:39.180
[Eliscu laughs]

1:23:39.264 --> 1:23:40.348
[crowd] Free Britney now!

1:23:40.432 --> 1:23:43.184
Today will be the first time
she will speak.

1:23:43.268 --> 1:23:46.938
At stake is control
of the 39-year-old singer's career

1:23:47.022 --> 1:23:49.232
and $60 million fortune.

1:23:51.234 --> 1:23:53.236
[suspenseful music playing]

1:23:59.659 --> 1:24:01.995
[inaudible dialogue]

1:24:08.918 --> 1:24:13.715
Going through introductions-
slash-formalities, Britney says, quote,

1:24:18.053 --> 1:24:20.555
[Britney] I have a lot to say,
so bear with me.

1:24:22.390 --> 1:24:26.895
I don't think I was heard on any level
when I came to court the last time.

1:24:28.188 --> 1:24:31.107
I brought four sheets of paper in my hand
and wrote in length

1:24:31.191 --> 1:24:34.152
what I had been through
the last four months before I came there.

1:24:34.652 --> 1:24:38.323
The people who did that to me
should not be able to walk away so easily.

1:24:38.406 --> 1:24:39.449
I'll recap.

1:24:39.991 --> 1:24:43.119
I was on tour.
My management said if I don't do this,

1:24:43.203 --> 1:24:45.413
I will have to find an attorney,
and by contract,

1:24:45.497 --> 1:24:49.542
my own management could sue me
if I didn't follow through with the tour.

1:24:49.626 --> 1:24:51.169
It was very threatening and scary,

1:24:51.252 --> 1:24:54.214
and with the conservatorship,
I couldn't even get my own attorney.

1:24:54.297 --> 1:24:57.133
So, out of fear,
I went ahead and I did the tour.

1:24:57.634 --> 1:25:01.679
When I came off that tour, a new show
in Las Vegas was supposed to take place.

1:25:01.763 --> 1:25:04.140
I started rehearsing early,
but it was hard

1:25:04.224 --> 1:25:08.186
'cause I'd been doing Vegas for four years
and I needed a break in between.

1:25:08.269 --> 1:25:11.940
But, no, I was told, "This is the timeline
and this is how it's gonna go."

1:25:12.565 --> 1:25:15.401
I was basically directing
most of the show.

1:25:15.485 --> 1:25:18.947
I taught my dancers
my new choreography myself.

1:25:19.030 --> 1:25:21.866
I wasn't good. I was great.

1:25:22.742 --> 1:25:24.744
[dramatic music playing]

1:25:28.248 --> 1:25:32.168
They said, if I don't want to do
the new Vegas show, I don't have to.

1:25:32.252 --> 1:25:35.296
It was like lifting,
literally, 200 pounds off of me.

1:25:36.631 --> 1:25:40.301
He immediately, the next day,
put me on lithium out of nowhere.

1:25:40.385 --> 1:25:42.971
He took me off my normal meds
I'd been on for five years.

1:25:43.054 --> 1:25:46.432
And lithium is a very, very strong
and completely different medication

1:25:46.516 --> 1:25:47.976
compared to what I was used to.

1:25:48.643 --> 1:25:51.062
Not only did my family not do
a goddamn thing,

1:25:51.146 --> 1:25:52.605
my dad was all for it.

1:25:53.398 --> 1:25:55.608
He loved every minute of it.

1:25:55.692 --> 1:25:58.945
The control he had over someone
as powerful as me…

1:26:00.321 --> 1:26:03.783
100,000% he loved it.

1:26:05.994 --> 1:26:09.038
That's why I'm telling you this again,
two years later,

1:26:09.122 --> 1:26:12.500
after I've lied and told the whole world
I'm okay and happy,

1:26:12.584 --> 1:26:13.585
it's a lie.

1:26:13.668 --> 1:26:17.172
I thought maybe I said that enough,
maybe I might become happy

1:26:17.255 --> 1:26:19.966
because I've been in denial,
I've been in shock.

1:26:20.049 --> 1:26:21.676
I am traumatized.

1:26:22.343 --> 1:26:24.179
But now I'm telling you the truth.

1:26:24.262 --> 1:26:25.972
I'm not happy. I can't sleep.

1:26:26.055 --> 1:26:29.976
I'm so angry, it's insane.
And I'm depressed. I cry every day.

1:26:30.059 --> 1:26:32.228
The reason I'm telling you this is
because I don't think

1:26:32.312 --> 1:26:35.565
how the state of California can have
all this written in the court documents

1:26:35.648 --> 1:26:37.984
from the time I showed up
and do absolutely nothing.

1:26:38.067 --> 1:26:42.113
Ma'am, my dad and anyone involved
in this conservatorship should be in jail.

1:26:42.780 --> 1:26:46.034
The last time I spoke to you,
it made me feel like I was dead,

1:26:46.117 --> 1:26:47.452
like I didn't matter.

1:26:47.535 --> 1:26:50.788
I'm telling you this again,
so maybe you can understand the depth

1:26:50.872 --> 1:26:54.584
and the degree and the damage
that they did to me back then.

1:26:54.667 --> 1:26:58.087
It's embarrassing and demoralizing
what I've been through,

1:26:58.171 --> 1:27:00.882
and that's the main reason
I've never said it openly.

1:27:00.965 --> 1:27:02.550
And I didn't want to say it openly

1:27:02.634 --> 1:27:05.428
'cause I honestly didn't think
anyone would believe me.

1:27:06.638 --> 1:27:09.933
I just want my life back.
It's been 13 years and it's enough.

1:27:10.016 --> 1:27:13.061
It makes no sense whatsoever
for the state of California to sit back

1:27:13.144 --> 1:27:16.564
and literally watch me make a living
for so many people

1:27:16.648 --> 1:27:19.108
and be told I'm not good enough.

1:27:19.943 --> 1:27:21.819
But I'm great at what I do.

1:27:33.623 --> 1:27:37.126
[audience chanting]
Britney, Britney, Britney!

1:27:38.086 --> 1:27:40.672
[Britney]
I feel ganged up on, and I feel bullied,

1:27:40.755 --> 1:27:43.424
and I feel left out and alone.

1:27:43.508 --> 1:27:45.760
And I'm tired of feeling alone.

1:27:45.843 --> 1:27:48.680
I deserve to have the same rights
as anybody does

1:27:48.763 --> 1:27:52.475
by having a child,
a family, any of those things.

1:27:53.559 --> 1:27:55.186
That's all I wanted to say to you,

1:27:55.270 --> 1:27:58.147
and thank you so much
for letting me speak to you today.

1:28:07.198 --> 1:28:09.200
[pensive music playing]

1:29:45.630 --> 1:29:47.632
[pensive music continues]
