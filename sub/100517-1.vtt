My apologies if your drink disappoints.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.457
It's not you. The nerve endings
in this thing are for shit.

04:09.540 --> 04:10.416
Ah!

04:10.500 --> 04:13.169
-You're wearing a synth.
-More like a latex glove.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.256
Everything tastes
like curried sawdust.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.009
Hmm. Perhaps an organic sleeve
would be more to your liking?

04:20.093 --> 04:23.346
Uh-uh. I'm traveling. Interstellar.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.225
May I ask what brings you
all the way to Maghda Prime?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.770
I'm looking for someone.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.481
Takeshi Kovacs?

04:33.564 --> 04:34.857
I beg your pardon.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.945
Word is he's owed a lot of credits
and he'll be here tonight to collect.

04:39.737 --> 04:41.864
Any idea which one of these losers is him?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.662
Hmm. I wish I could be of service,

04:48.121 --> 04:51.749
but I hear Takeshi Kovacs
is off on an epic quest

04:51.833 --> 04:54.043
to find his long-lost love,
Quellcrist Falconer.

04:58.381 --> 05:01.551
Oh, sounds like a load
of swamp-panther crap to me.

05:01.634 --> 05:03.469
I assure you, it is not.

05:03.553 --> 05:08.975
You expect me to buy that Takeshi Kovacs,
the Last Envoy, and Quellcrist Falconer,

05:09.058 --> 05:11.102
leader of the Uprising,

05:11.602 --> 05:13.980
had a thing?

05:14.063 --> 05:17.275
If you mean a passionate connection
transcending time

05:17.358 --> 05:20.862
and challenging the grim bounds
of death itself,

05:21.362 --> 05:24.198
then yes, they had a <i>thing.</i>

05:27.035 --> 05:28.411
I never heard that.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.081
Sounds like you know a lot about him.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.001
Oh, I consider myself somewhat
of an authority on the subject.

05:35.084 --> 05:36.336
Prove it.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.588
Untraceable credits.

05:39.547 --> 05:40.882
I've got more...

05:41.758 --> 05:44.427
if you can point him out...

05:46.262 --> 05:47.138
Uh...

05:53.644 --> 05:54.812
Point out who?

05:54.896 --> 05:56.314
I just told you.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.941
I regret, a vicious attack
on my person-hood

05:59.025 --> 06:01.486
has left my memory a trifle...

06:02.236 --> 06:03.196
unreliable?

06:04.030 --> 06:05.782
Perhaps, if you reminded me.

06:07.742 --> 06:08.785
What's your name again?

06:09.660 --> 06:10.620
Hey!

06:10.703 --> 06:13.831
I work here, you don't.
Stop harassing the customers.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.249
Hmm.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.959
Ugh, fucking rogue AI.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.045
You see an emitter around here?

06:19.712 --> 06:21.005
An emitter?

06:21.839 --> 06:24.050
He's a holo.
Talks people's ears off.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.677
He's got stories from all over
the settled worlds.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.262
You think any of them are true?

06:28.346 --> 06:30.515
I think if I ever find
that emitter he's tethered to,

06:30.598 --> 06:32.058
I'm gonna use it for target practice.

Do you know him?

07:03.089 --> 07:05.049

07:42.295 --> 07:43.921
thank you very much.

07:44.589 --> 07:48.134
I thought this might happen.
You all work it out.

Kovacs?

09:22.019 --> 09:24.564
-Is that you?
-In the flesh.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.857
Just not the kind
you were expecting.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.068
Why didn't you say something
before it all went to shit?

09:29.151 --> 09:30.319
Your money's back in the bar.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.155
My money's in your pocket.

09:33.864 --> 09:37.618
You palmed it and left those suckers
to kill each other over an empty case.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.500
Okay.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.169
Maybe not completely empty.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.464
-Yeah.
-Missed me.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.093
All right, all right. Here.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.305
Take it.

10:00.808 --> 10:04.979
This is half of what you owe me.
How am I supposed to get off planet?

10:05.062 --> 10:07.148
Look, there's another job.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.066
You could have my cut.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.573
Relax.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.783
Just the messenger.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.495
I was hired to find you.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.289
How the fuck did you?

10:24.373 --> 10:28.628
For starters, that's a wide-frequency
emitter you got there on your hip.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.382
I hear Takeshi Kovacs goes nowhere
without his crazy AI.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.718
Yeah, well, I don't like
being interrupted either.

10:35.801 --> 10:37.762
It's not like you were gonna say yes.

10:38.512 --> 10:39.639
And I'm on a deadline.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.725
Horace Axley wants to talk to you.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.393
Meth.

10:45.269 --> 10:46.812
It's a job offer.

10:47.563 --> 10:48.397
Short term.

10:49.398 --> 10:50.775
I don't work for Meths.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.777
You have before.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.363
Tell your boss, hard pass.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.200
I don't care how many credits he's got.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.494
Forget it.

11:02.953 --> 11:03.788
Okay.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.922
Told you. I'm on a deadline.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.847
You wanted to get off planet.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.726
You shot me in the back.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.978
Organic damage isn't personal.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.522
It's business.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.109
Honor gets in the way of profit.

11:41.826 --> 11:42.993
Let me guess.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.329
You're Axley?

11:45.955 --> 11:49.500
Have you ever heard of an ONI?
Because you could have done your research.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.129
I fucking hate getting shot.

11:53.671 --> 11:55.631
Well, I wasn't sure you'd take my call.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.676
I hate Meths too.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.054
Well, perhaps this will assuage you.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.655
Accept my offer and this is the sleeve
you'll have waiting for you.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.826
Bespoke design by Khumalo Bioware.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.203
Military use only, aftermarket upgrades,

12:27.163 --> 12:29.290
rapid healing, enhanced reaction time,

12:29.373 --> 12:33.669
biometric mag plates among other bells
and whistles. Does it help you say yes?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.881
Does your definition of consent
always involve restraints?

12:36.964 --> 12:40.426
That wasn't my call. My associates set up
this virtual sub routine.

12:40.509 --> 12:41.969
You mean, your bounty hunter.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.972
She's done quite a few jobs for me.
She's efficient.

12:45.055 --> 12:46.515
She's a psychopath.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.809
Well, coming from you,
I'll assume that's a compliment.

12:50.352 --> 12:51.228
I'll adjust it.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.146
Don't bother.

12:52.229 --> 12:55.274
Envoy 101: I control the construct.

13:00.154 --> 13:02.239
You know what I hate more than Meths

13:02.740 --> 13:03.866
or death by gunfire?

13:04.700 --> 13:06.118
It's being underestimated.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.999
This room isn't real.
Your stacks in conducting gel.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.335
You're not getting out of that body
without me.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.712
One minute.

13:16.796 --> 13:19.548
If you're still not interested,
I'll cast you back to Maghda Prime

13:19.632 --> 13:22.718
in whatever lounge performer sleeve
you want.

13:23.010 --> 13:26.013
It better be good.
I always wanted to play piano.

13:28.516 --> 13:32.311
I need your protection.

13:32.394 --> 13:33.479
From what?

13:34.355 --> 13:36.148
There's a war where I come from.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.859
Get private security or go on vacation.
Or move.

13:38.943 --> 13:40.861
I have business interests I can't forsake.

13:40.945 --> 13:43.072
I believe no one can protect me
better than you.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.533
-I don't care.
-I can give you what you want.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.077
No matter what you have,
it won't be enough.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.037
Quellcrist Falconer.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.962
Be very careful what you say next.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.672
I can show you where she is,

13:59.755 --> 14:01.924
and I'll pay you enough the two of you
can disappear.

14:02.007 --> 14:03.133
I don't believe you.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.677
You'll see for yourself.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.846
I can deliver her.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.765
How? How do you know it's really her?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.475
Do you have her DHF?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.394
Is she spun up, re-sleeved?

14:13.477 --> 14:15.020
Where the fuck did you find her?

14:15.104 --> 14:17.314
I'll answer all your questions
when you're here.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.608
As long as you keep me alive.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.611
Falconer's life for mine.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.613
Do I have your word?

14:27.616 --> 14:28.868
If you're lying,

14:29.702 --> 14:32.496
you have my word
the last thing you'll see is this face

14:32.580 --> 14:35.708
before your stack is ripped
from your spine.

14:39.753 --> 14:43.382
I crossed the stars in a colony ship
before stacks were invented.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.844
I left a dying Earth behind
to seed a new world.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.722
You don't scare me, Mr. Kovacs.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.309
I know what you dream of.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.902
Make sure there's a mirror.

15:04.778 --> 15:09.325
And get your psychopath bounty hunter
to transmit my AI.

15:11.076 --> 15:11.952
Already done.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.508
<i>Stay alive long enough,</i>

15:44.318 --> 15:46.904

<i>But if you chase after shadows...</i>

15:55.287 --> 15:58.332
<i>if you're foolish enough to seek out</i>

15:58.415 --> 16:00.167

Yeah, but those aren't stars.

19:26.039 --> 19:27.040
Angelfire.

19:28.917 --> 19:30.377
Obviously we're on...

19:33.338 --> 19:34.590
Harlan's World?

19:34.673 --> 19:37.676
You know another planet
with a sky full of Elder Orbitals?

19:40.012 --> 19:42.181
Home again, home again. Huzzah.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.852
-How long has it been? Five years?
-Try 30.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.355
Of all the godforsaken rocks
we've been to,

19:50.689 --> 19:52.399
we're right back where we started.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.360
I thought you swore you'd never return.
What compelled you?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.404
Horace Axley compelled me.

19:57.487 --> 20:00.532
And who, pray tell, is Horace Axley?

20:01.742 --> 20:02.826
He's that one.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.830
My word.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.459
-We just got here.
-I didn't kill him.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.586
What a refreshing change. Hmm.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.590
Is it prudent to loiter?

20:16.673 --> 20:19.593
We're in a house with a murdered Meth.
Whatever happened, I'll be blamed.

20:19.676 --> 20:23.263
Now Axley said this sleeve
has a personalized weapons augment.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.308
-Just have to be within range.

20:30.479 --> 20:31.688
Oh, my.

20:32.773 --> 20:33.607
Let's go.

21:08.684 --> 21:11.687
Look, the needlecast station.
It's a sign. We should heed it.

21:12.854 --> 21:14.815
Not until I find out who killed Axley.

21:14.898 --> 21:17.985
We have no idea what Mr. Axley
will remember after he spins back up.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.487
And as you said, so astutely,

21:20.570 --> 21:23.991
accusations for his murder
could land squarely on you.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.325
If we are apprehended,

21:25.409 --> 21:28.620
you will be arrested,
and I will be deleted.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.497
-Choosing to stay here is...
-It's not a choice.

21:30.580 --> 21:31.832
...self-destructive.

21:32.708 --> 21:34.293
-Suicide!
-I'm not leaving.

21:34.376 --> 21:36.920
You don't get it. Axley was a Meth.

21:37.004 --> 21:39.172
He should have been untouchable
with his resources,

21:39.256 --> 21:40.799
but he was scared shitless.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.635
He believed he needed protection.
And he was right.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.512
If he was right about that...

21:47.306 --> 21:48.807
he might be right about Quell.

21:51.893 --> 21:52.769
Quell?

21:53.645 --> 21:54.938
He said she's here.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.899
He swore to prove it if I kept him alive.

21:58.692 --> 22:01.194
I see. If that is the case...

22:02.779 --> 22:04.281
we'll need some place to stay.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.117
I know a place.

22:07.826 --> 22:10.412
An old AI hotel a friend of mine
used to own.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.166
<i>There has also been</i>
<i>a decrease in terrorist activity</i>

22:14.249 --> 22:16.168
<i>within the city of Millsport itself.</i>

22:16.251 --> 22:19.588
<i>Negotiations with Joshua Kemp are ongoing</i>

22:19.671 --> 22:21.631
<i>-as we await...</i>
<i>-</i>Check the local feed.

22:21.715 --> 22:23.467
Axley said something about a war.

22:24.301 --> 22:26.595
It appears we've arrived
in the middle of it.

22:29.431 --> 22:32.017
True salvation is found in renunciation.

22:32.100 --> 22:36.188
Become a Renouncer and the world can be
as you make it. No loss, no pain.

22:36.271 --> 22:37.147
No, thank you.

22:46.573 --> 22:50.952
Do a search on Konrad Harlan,
see what the old bastard's up to.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.955
<i>Attention, stand by</i>
<i>for an important message</i>

22:54.039 --> 22:55.290
<i>from Governor Harlan.</i>

22:55.832 --> 22:57.167
That's not Konrad.

22:57.250 --> 23:01.254
According to the Array,
Konrad recently abdicated his position,

23:01.922 --> 23:03.715
along with everything else.

23:03.799 --> 23:04.716
You're kidding?

23:04.800 --> 23:09.054
In his absence, his daughter, Danica,
has taken up his mantle.

23:09.137 --> 23:11.848
Let me guess. She ran unopposed.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.350
That is also accurate.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.064
<i>Citizens of Harlan's World,</i>

23:19.606 --> 23:23.693
<i>for 20 years the Quellist rebellion</i>
<i>has disrupted our way of life.</i>

23:24.319 --> 23:25.904
<i>Mines have been sabotaged,</i>

23:25.987 --> 23:29.699
<i>alloy shipments attacked,</i>
<i>our people dislocated.</i>

23:29.783 --> 23:32.911
<i>At every step, we have fought back</i>
<i>against these terrorists,</i>

23:34.037 --> 23:37.290
<i>weakening them,</i>
<i>rooting them out of our cities.</i>

23:38.625 --> 23:41.253
But we have also suffered great loss.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.630
It's with this shared burden in mind

23:43.713 --> 23:48.218
<i>that I have recently entered into talks</i>
<i>with Quellist leader Joshua Kemp.</i>

23:52.097 --> 23:54.808
It would seem the revolution
has a new face as well.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.269
I've seen enough.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.105
<i> After much negotiation,</i>

24:00.188 --> 24:04.276
we have agreed this conflict must end.

24:04.734 --> 24:08.196
<i>A cease-fire is now in place</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

24:10.490 --> 24:14.286
<i>Starting tomorrow,</i>
<i>mining operations resume in full.</i>

24:15.745 --> 24:20.292
<i>Make no mistake, if the cease-fire</i>
<i>is broken, our retaliation will be swift.</i>

24:21.001 --> 24:23.962
But tonight, as your governor

24:24.045 --> 24:26.423
and as my father's daughter,

24:26.506 --> 24:31.678
<i>I am proud to declare the safety</i>
<i>of Harlan's World has been secured.</i>

24:33.096 --> 24:35.474
Thank you. Good night.

24:43.398 --> 24:44.774
Congratulations.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.776
You've brought peace to the world.

24:49.488 --> 24:53.158
My father used to say that a cease-fire
was just a breath between battles.

24:53.700 --> 24:55.327
A breath's all we need.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.996
The Protectorate will have to return
their colonel now.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.290
No war, no reason to stay.

25:00.790 --> 25:04.878
Over half the stacks in existence
are made of alloy dug from our trenches.

25:04.961 --> 25:07.297
We're the goddamn fountain
of eternal life, Stone.

25:08.173 --> 25:10.842
Colonel Carrera has every reason to stay.

25:11.718 --> 25:15.889
The only thing standing between
the Protectorate and us is them.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.935
Well, I think you're giving <i>them</i>
too much credit.

25:20.852 --> 25:22.270
Elders are extinct.

25:22.812 --> 25:26.399
Anyone who builds weaponized satellites
we can't shoot down

25:26.483 --> 25:28.401
deserves to be taken seriously.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.195
And did your father say that too?

25:31.112 --> 25:32.572
Quellcrist Falconer actually.

25:34.783 --> 25:36.576
Keep an eye on Colonel Carrera.

25:37.452 --> 25:40.330
Let's make sure he doesn't come up
with another reason to stay.

25:50.298 --> 25:52.175
I believe we made a wrong turn.

25:52.342 --> 25:55.178
The Array has no evidence
of a decommissioned hotel in this area.

25:55.262 --> 25:58.056
Well, the guy who owns it
pays a lot of money to keep it that way.

25:58.139 --> 26:01.142
Hmm.
One of your more unsavory acquaintances?

26:01.226 --> 26:03.186
Depends where you stand on Yakuza.

26:03.937 --> 26:04.771
Yakuza?

26:04.854 --> 26:08.567
The big boss has a dozen of these places,
half safe house, half black site.

26:08.650 --> 26:10.443
I've used it before so he won't--

26:11.069 --> 26:12.153
Damn it, Poe.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.074
-You glitched.
-Ah!

26:16.741 --> 26:17.867
There you are.

26:18.743 --> 26:21.079
-Try and stick with me, okay?
-Of course.

26:22.330 --> 26:24.833
-Where are we going again?
-I just told you, twice.

26:24.916 --> 26:25.750
Oh.

26:26.668 --> 26:27.961
Are we there yet?

26:29.838 --> 26:30.714
We're here.

26:38.346 --> 26:39.848
And are you certain it is safe?

26:42.142 --> 26:44.644
- You're under arrest for treason.
-Good to see you too, Jaeger.

26:48.148 --> 26:49.232
Safe enough.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.110
If you'll excuse me, I will leave you

26:52.527 --> 26:54.779
to adjust the configuration
of the nanoswarm.

27:31.524 --> 27:32.942
Trespassers!

27:33.026 --> 27:35.111
I did not sanction this.
This building is off-limits.

27:36.905 --> 27:38.907
Who the hell do you think you are?

27:40.408 --> 27:41.534
You got a death wish?

27:46.665 --> 27:47.540
Answer me.

27:48.124 --> 27:51.086
I am Tanaseda Hideki. This is my property.

27:52.337 --> 27:55.340
Tanaseda wouldn't be caught dead
in a common combat sleeve.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.219
Arrows and bullets all spent...

27:59.302 --> 28:01.471
with sadness we fall.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.307
But unless I smite the enemy,

28:04.391 --> 28:05.809
my body cannot rot in the field.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.311
Where did you hear that?

28:08.770 --> 28:12.023
I told you, I'm Tanaseda Hideki.

28:12.899 --> 28:15.944
Continue this disrespect,
whoever you may be...

28:17.696 --> 28:19.989
and I will rip you from that sleeve.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.620
Almost had me.

28:27.497 --> 28:28.957
Only one mistake.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.877
I'm Tanaseda Yukito.

28:34.671 --> 28:37.215
You don't recognize
your own great-grandson?

28:40.635 --> 28:41.594
<i>Ojiichan?</i>

28:43.805 --> 28:46.057
Now that you mention it,
you do look familiar.

28:48.435 --> 28:50.311
That sleeve
is worth a bundle, Yuki-<i>san.</i>

28:53.064 --> 28:54.566
That's some custom shit.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.447
Preserve the sleeve.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.906
Sir, I set up a nanoswarm,

29:01.990 --> 29:07.036
so if you would be so kind
as to plug in the emitter,

29:07.120 --> 29:10.582
perhaps I can assist in negotiating
this misunderstanding.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.125
Perhaps not.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.339
Nothing common about that.

30:40.255 --> 30:41.172
You're a dead man.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.471
But first, you get to explain
to my great-grandfather

30:48.555 --> 30:50.390
why you know my family's death poem.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.600
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.996
So this is the man
who dares take my name.

31:21.462 --> 31:22.755
A heavy burden...

31:23.715 --> 31:27.302
not worth stealing and harder to carry.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.387
My name carries its own weight.

31:30.930 --> 31:34.267
He impersonated you, <i>Sosofu.</i>
Sleeve killed two of my men.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.603
How do you know
my family's death poem?

31:36.686 --> 31:40.189
You recited it to me almost 300 years ago

31:41.065 --> 31:44.527
in a teahouse in New Hokkaido.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.239
Foolish child.

31:49.073 --> 31:52.785
Do you have any idea who you escorted
past my security?

31:52.869 --> 31:56.122
Perhaps you'd like to cut out my stack
and hand it to him as well.

31:56.205 --> 31:57.957
No, we beat him.

31:59.334 --> 32:00.460
He's not a threat.

32:02.295 --> 32:03.129
Educate him.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.770
Forgive me, <i>Oyabun.</i>

32:19.938 --> 32:21.940
I asked you
to make a point, and you made it.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.274
I don't understand.

32:24.817 --> 32:26.277
He's an Envoy.

32:26.361 --> 32:29.739
He allowed you to beat him
because he wanted an audience.

32:29.822 --> 32:32.408
He recited the poem
so you would have to comply.

32:32.492 --> 32:35.453
Isn't that right, Takeshi-<i>san?</i>

32:38.206 --> 32:41.668
I'm not here to endanger you,
only to ask a favor.

32:42.168 --> 32:43.711
I need a place to stay.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.421
Off the grid.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.715
But my great-grandson didn't know that.

32:49.092 --> 32:50.176
I'll make amends.

32:50.259 --> 32:52.178
Start by vacating the building.

32:53.554 --> 32:59.060
This man did a job for me
after the fall of Stronghold.

32:59.811 --> 33:02.230
When one of our own betrayed me,

33:02.313 --> 33:07.110
he was caught by the Protectorate,
tortured in every way they knew how.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.362
He never gave me up.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.658
He is not to be bothered again!

33:23.793 --> 33:28.381
Yukito is young,
but still, that was disappointing.

33:29.632 --> 33:31.259
Family usually is.

33:32.927 --> 33:36.556
I see your gift for understatement
hasn't changed.

33:37.473 --> 33:38.933
Has anything else?

33:40.893 --> 33:42.228
I'm still looking for her.

33:43.104 --> 33:47.275
Horace Axley told me that she was here
on Harlan's, said he could prove it.

33:47.859 --> 33:48.943
I protected him...

33:50.028 --> 33:50.987
but I was too late.

33:53.281 --> 33:56.284
Axley and I go back a long way,
Takeshi-<i>san.</i>

33:56.367 --> 34:00.038
He would lie to the devil himself
if he stood something to gain.

34:00.121 --> 34:03.833
Well, someone went savage on him.
This time he wasn't lying.

34:05.793 --> 34:07.879
I gave no orders to eliminate Axley.

34:09.297 --> 34:10.757
The last time you were here,

34:11.591 --> 34:17.180
you suspected your sister had hidden
Quellcrist Falconer's DHF.

34:18.639 --> 34:21.726
Has it ever occurred to you
that Reileen was lying?

34:21.809 --> 34:26.731
That Axley merely dangled Falconer's
whereabouts to bend you to his will?

34:26.814 --> 34:28.483
Every minute of every day.

34:29.525 --> 34:33.029
But if there's a chance that anything
he said is true...

34:34.113 --> 34:35.448
I can't walk away.

34:36.657 --> 34:37.867
That's not love.

34:38.701 --> 34:39.827
It's obsession.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.423
This is the first Songspire grown
in captivity,

34:52.507 --> 34:55.384
my personal experiment over the centuries.

34:56.761 --> 34:58.513
You sound like a scientist.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.891
Remnants of an abandoned past.

35:02.391 --> 35:06.312
The cells in our bodies are constantly
dying and being replaced.

35:06.395 --> 35:09.816
As we age, we become a copy
of a copy of a copy,

35:10.191 --> 35:11.734
degrading each time.

35:13.986 --> 35:15.488
Meths have got around that.

35:16.405 --> 35:17.323
Have we?

35:19.408 --> 35:22.620
We transfer our minds into new sleeves,

35:23.287 --> 35:26.165
but what if the spirit degrades as well?

35:26.499 --> 35:29.627
We can't quantify the change,
but we are not the same.

35:30.545 --> 35:32.880
I'm not the person I once was.

35:35.007 --> 35:36.134
Neither are you.

35:39.303 --> 35:41.097
Nor, I suspect, is she.

35:45.768 --> 35:48.062
I didn't come here for a lesson, <i>Oyabun.</i>

35:52.859 --> 35:54.235
I should get back.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.333
<i>Time is the greatest of all warriors.</i>

36:10.877 --> 36:12.378
<i>What it doesn't destroy,</i>

36:13.254 --> 36:15.965
<i>it alters beyond recognition.</i>

36:18.176 --> 36:20.553
<i>Time tears down everything.</i>

36:22.263 --> 36:24.891
<i>We brace our backs against the void,</i>

36:25.641 --> 36:28.603
<i>desperate to hold on to the past...</i>

36:31.355 --> 36:32.690
<i>to our ghosts...</i>

36:35.109 --> 36:36.694
<i>to ourselves.</i>

37:41.384 --> 37:42.218
Ah.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.428
My apologies, sir.

37:45.179 --> 37:47.890
I'm afraid our old haunt
is much like myself,

37:48.933 --> 37:50.893
in a state of broken-down disarray.

38:02.863 --> 38:07.243
Perhaps "The Nevermore"
would be a more apt moniker.

38:08.911 --> 38:09.870
Is there whiskey?

38:12.123 --> 38:17.670
I believe the former tenants
left a passable bottle of...

38:20.214 --> 38:21.799
Oh! Single malt.

38:21.882 --> 38:22.925
Then it's fine.

38:23.801 --> 38:26.637
All I want is a bed
and no more bullshit for one day.

38:27.221 --> 38:32.685
Hmm, can I infer you... triumphed
against adversity once again?

38:33.811 --> 38:35.187
I'm on a planet I hate,

38:35.855 --> 38:38.983
I don't know who killed Axley
or how I'll find them,

38:39.692 --> 38:41.986
and I'm no closer to Quell
than I was before.

38:43.487 --> 38:44.572
So...

38:45.948 --> 38:47.033
that's a no.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.785
Good night, Poe.

39:00.296 --> 39:01.547
Good night, sir.

39:24.904 --> 39:26.572
I can't do this anymore.

39:28.991 --> 39:33.287
This wild-goose chase across the stars,
running after you.

39:37.792 --> 39:39.335
This isn't true, is it?

39:40.878 --> 39:43.422
You're just a figment...

39:44.465 --> 39:45.633
in my head.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.011
That's all there is left.

39:51.138 --> 39:52.098
You're gone.

39:53.891 --> 39:55.768
You have your answer, Tak.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.063
-It's in the one place you're not looking.
-I don't know what that means.

39:59.146 --> 40:02.525
When we made stacks, we thought
we severed the mind from the body,

40:02.608 --> 40:04.318
but the truth is more complicated.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.822
I'm done with complicated.
Either you're dead or you're not.

40:09.782 --> 40:12.201
Our bodies know things,

40:12.743 --> 40:14.453
our skin, our bones,

40:14.537 --> 40:17.373
our flesh hold our experiences.

40:18.707 --> 40:22.503
What does your body, this body, remember?

40:26.966 --> 40:28.342
Feel what you felt...

40:29.093 --> 40:31.178
then you can remember what you saw.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.267
State-dependent memory.

41:28.319 --> 41:29.153
Quell!

41:33.824 --> 41:34.992
I did what you told me.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.412
I survived.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.249
I'm not here for you.
