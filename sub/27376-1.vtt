00:23.691 --> 00:29.628
Be pleased then, you living one,
in your delightfully warmed bed,

00:30.050 --> 00:35.072
before Lethe's ice-cold wave
will lick your escaping foot.

00:36.963 --> 00:38.199
Goethe.

01:35.787 --> 01:37.488
I had a nightmare.

01:43.684 --> 01:45.994
I dreamed that bombers were coming.

02:01.347 --> 02:03.040
Could you leave?

02:05.790 --> 02:07.305
Get lost!

02:09.798 --> 02:12.292
Scram!

02:13.816 --> 02:16.789
What about Bobbo? It's your dog.

02:17.615 --> 02:19.241
Both of you.

02:21.317 --> 02:23.623
Leave, both of you!

02:24.095 --> 02:25.969
Now that's not very nice of you.

02:27.425 --> 02:28.974
No one understands me.

02:29.445 --> 02:31.628
What the hell are you talking about?

02:32.384 --> 02:35.161
No one bloody understands me!

02:36.209 --> 02:39.438
No one likes me either. No one!

02:39.944 --> 02:43.529
Jesus Christ! You know
perfectly well that I like you.

02:45.488 --> 02:47.036
It's not true.

02:47.583 --> 02:50.205
It's all a big goddamn lie.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.652
No one likes me!

02:53.561 --> 02:55.404
- I like you.
- No one!

02:55.711 --> 02:59.513
Bobbo likes you,
and he doesn't lie, does he?

03:00.135 --> 03:02.403
He bloody well does too.

03:05.645 --> 03:06.920
Get out of here!

03:08.611 --> 03:09.906
Both of you!

03:13.056 --> 03:14.712
Come, Bobbo.

03:21.643 --> 03:24.567
Maybe things would be better
if I didn't exist.

03:25.526 --> 03:28.219
So you wouldn't have to feel guilty.

03:31.405 --> 03:33.726
Now that really hurts my feelings.

03:34.242 --> 03:38.504
Do you think I want you to die?
That won't make things better.

03:39.348 --> 03:43.652
You have to do your best in life.
Or at least try.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.845
And after all,
there's lots of fun things, right?

03:48.406 --> 03:51.460
- We had a good time yesterday.
- Sure, yesterday.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.000
No...

03:56.771 --> 03:59.721
If only I had a motorcycle.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.572
Then I'd take off,
get away from all this shit.

04:06.044 --> 04:08.235
- Right away.
- Yeah, yeah.

04:10.481 --> 04:12.628
By the way, the oven is on.

04:13.817 --> 04:16.076
- What's in it?
- A roast.

04:16.406 --> 04:18.966
- What kind of roast?
- Veal.

04:20.533 --> 04:21.748
Piss off!

04:22.673 --> 04:24.038
Both of you!

04:29.584 --> 04:32.223
I might be over in a while.

04:36.225 --> 04:40.882
A motorcycle is my dream,
I'd be so happy that I'd scream.

04:41.132 --> 04:45.293
A lovely thing with blazing speed
to leave this place is what I need.

04:45.515 --> 04:47.801
It takes a pile of dough...

04:48.018 --> 04:49.479
...and a license, you know.

04:50.176 --> 04:52.027
But I'm all out...

04:52.273 --> 04:54.641
...and that I'm pretty pissed
and mad about.

04:54.850 --> 04:58.993
Hardly ever dreams come true,
same thing goes for my dreams too.

04:59.167 --> 05:01.559
Here I sit in a park and stare.

05:01.723 --> 05:03.778
The whole world waits for me
out there.

05:04.009 --> 05:05.443
I'm a miserable wench...

05:06.226 --> 05:07.676
on an ugly bench.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.579
- Is it strange to pray?
- No, it's OK.

05:10.851 --> 05:13.332
For a bike to take me far away.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.139
Nobody understands me.

06:01.217 --> 06:04.118
You, the living

07:57.782 --> 07:59.800
Olle.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.854
What are you doing?

08:04.304 --> 08:05.636
I'm standing here.

08:06.889 --> 08:09.098
Well, I can see that,
but what are you doing?

08:10.555 --> 08:12.611
I'm standing here.
That's what I'm doing.

08:17.208 --> 08:19.896
- You're thinking too, aren't you?
- Of course I am.

08:22.496 --> 08:24.347
So what are you thinking about?

08:25.283 --> 08:28.053
Well, now that you ask
I've forgotten.

08:30.386 --> 08:31.988
Did you think about me at all?

08:32.410 --> 08:34.590
Maybe I wasn't.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.621
You never do.

08:39.268 --> 08:40.812
Now you're exaggerating.

08:45.606 --> 08:48.378
Aren't you coming to bed?
Tomorrow is another day.

08:49.534 --> 08:50.647
What did you say?

08:51.221 --> 08:52.758
Aren't you coming to bed?

08:53.579 --> 08:56.688
Yeah, I guess so.
Tomorrow is another day.

08:57.391 --> 08:59.813
- What did you say?
- Tomorrow is another day.

09:13.649 --> 09:15.028
Didn't you hear what I said?

09:15.545 --> 09:16.655
Get lost!

09:17.445 --> 09:19.650
Get out of here, both of you.

09:21.740 --> 09:24.339
- You're not being very nice.
- Well, maybe I'm not.

09:25.374 --> 09:26.368
Get lost!

09:31.717 --> 09:34.956
OK, everyone!
Last orders now!

09:35.839 --> 09:39.286
Last orders!
Tomorrow is another day.

09:39.771 --> 09:41.897
Last chance to get really drunk.

10:02.125 --> 10:04.317
I might be along in a while!

10:17.891 --> 10:19.700
- Hello.
- Hi.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.048
There's something I just have to say.

10:23.551 --> 10:24.657
Okay.

10:25.120 --> 10:27.547
I think you play so very well.

10:28.463 --> 10:30.588
Thanks. That's nice to hear.

10:31.862 --> 10:33.770
That's all I wanted to say.

10:34.962 --> 10:35.948
Okay.

10:39.524 --> 10:41.215
A beer maybe?

10:41.881 --> 10:45.021
Thanks. I don't drink beer.
It makes me sleepy.

10:46.700 --> 10:47.651
Okay.

10:49.839 --> 10:51.609
How about a drink?

10:52.418 --> 10:53.511
Yes.

10:53.955 --> 10:56.539
- What kind?
- Caipirinha.

10:58.620 --> 11:01.788
Would your friend like one too?

11:02.220 --> 11:04.353
Don't know, I'll ask.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.561
- She does.
- Nobody understands me.

11:16.609 --> 11:18.153
- Johan!
- Nobody understands me...

11:19.188 --> 11:20.938
Not a bloody soul.

12:50.255 --> 12:53.139
- Good morning, everyone.
- Good morning, ma'am.

13:40.428 --> 13:42.203
What's wrong, ma'am?

13:43.708 --> 13:47.023
My husband called me a hag.

13:51.300 --> 13:52.765
What's that?

13:54.557 --> 13:56.018
Why don't you ask him?

14:06.491 --> 14:10.080
We don't seem to have green
in that length.

14:10.904 --> 14:13.401
We should have a red one over here.

14:17.327 --> 14:19.340
Shall we look at it?

14:20.311 --> 14:21.062
Yes.

14:31.652 --> 14:33.421
Is it really ten feet?

14:34.515 --> 14:36.735
It should be, yes.

14:46.037 --> 14:47.636
No, in fact it wasn't.

14:49.114 --> 14:51.079
- Joergen!
- Yes!

14:51.939 --> 14:54.841
Have you sold
any of that red runner today?

14:55.347 --> 14:58.197
Yes. A few feet went this morning.

14:58.535 --> 15:01.716
- Then you have to change the label.
- Right.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.624
A lot of things
are going wrong today.

15:15.828 --> 15:17.647
It's just not my day.

15:22.576 --> 15:24.927
I've had a fight with my wife.

15:25.586 --> 15:26.718
It happens.

15:27.190 --> 15:30.030
The thing is
I happened to call her a hag.

15:30.527 --> 15:34.375
- That wasn't very nice.
- But she called me an old fart.

15:35.180 --> 15:37.248
- Sorry?
- Old fart?

15:38.066 --> 15:41.198
I think hag is worse.
Don't you think so, Gustav?

15:41.479 --> 15:43.265
The devil knows.
Let's go.

16:02.477 --> 16:04.186
Did you call for me?

16:04.772 --> 16:07.675
- What?
- Was it you who called for me?

16:08.045 --> 16:09.655
Called? Nope.

16:10.558 --> 16:13.291
- Jonas, did you call for Holger?
- What did you say?

16:14.354 --> 16:18.099
- Did you call for Holger?
- No.

16:18.356 --> 16:20.451
- What about Lasse?
- Lasse!

16:21.069 --> 16:24.358
- Did you call for Holger?
- No, why?

16:25.961 --> 16:27.332
- Nope.
- Nope.

17:27.950 --> 17:30.077
I had a dream last night.

17:35.689 --> 17:38.161
It was not a pleasant dream,
mind you.

17:41.086 --> 17:43.575
I dreamed I was
at a family dinner party.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.478
A bloody big dinner party.

17:47.398 --> 17:49.616
I couldn't understand
why I was there.

17:50.390 --> 17:52.298
I wasn't related to anyone.

17:53.231 --> 17:55.206
I didn't know anyone either.

17:56.539 --> 17:58.598
It was a dreary gathering.

17:59.363 --> 18:01.654
Bloody hell, it was depressing.

18:03.264 --> 18:08.465
I didn't understand why,
but I got the feeling it was my fault...

18:10.071 --> 18:15.195
I felt it was up to me to lighten up
the atmosphere, do something funny.

18:17.997 --> 18:20.511
I thought
I'll do the tablecloth trick,

18:21.017 --> 18:23.375
even though I'd never done it before.

18:24.174 --> 18:27.090
There was a hell of a lot of china...

18:28.577 --> 18:31.581
that came off the table with the cloth.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.971
Good God. The police came...

18:36.668 --> 18:38.631
...and there was a trial.

18:39.874 --> 18:43.025
I was charged with gross negligence...

18:43.741 --> 18:46.204
...disregarding
someone else's property.

18:47.154 --> 18:49.786
The worst thing you could do,
they said.

19:44.395 --> 19:46.091
It's two hundred years old.

19:46.904 --> 19:49.370
More that two hundred years old.

19:51.303 --> 19:52.584
Don't worry about it.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.275
Perhaps we should eat first?

20:13.155 --> 20:15.051
That shouldn't be necessary.

21:08.833 --> 21:10.919
What's all this bloody commotion!

21:12.504 --> 21:14.670
Counsellor Akerblom.

21:15.062 --> 21:19.410
I would like to inform you
that no tears in the world

21:19.623 --> 21:22.775
can affect
the verdict of this court.

21:23.184 --> 21:25.816
Is that understood?

21:28.475 --> 21:30.211
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

21:31.903 --> 21:32.946
Continue.

21:33.587 --> 21:35.483
Right, Your honour.

21:35.981 --> 21:38.781
This is a matter
of particularly gross negligence

21:39.032 --> 21:40.558
and destruction of property.

21:42.089 --> 21:44.832
Particularly gross negligence.

21:46.603 --> 21:50.357
The set, it was handed down
from my great-great-grandmother.

21:52.279 --> 21:54.838
And it was more than
two hundred years old.

22:00.877 --> 22:02.479
How old did you say it was?

22:02.828 --> 22:05.072
More than two hundred years.

22:09.725 --> 22:11.841
Life sentence, in my view.

22:13.697 --> 22:15.036
That's not enough.

22:18.035 --> 22:21.001
- The electric chair perhaps.
- Precisely.

22:33.461 --> 22:36.563
- The electric chair?
- Yes!

22:40.493 --> 22:43.568
The electric chair,
going once, twice, three times.

22:44.856 --> 22:47.163
The electric chair.

22:52.076 --> 22:53.781
That's life.

23:40.188 --> 23:41.676
What the hell was that?

24:34.467 --> 24:36.686
Try to relax, Benny.

24:40.525 --> 24:42.912
Benny, try to relax.

24:46.008 --> 24:48.753
It was from
my great-great-grandmother.

24:49.152 --> 24:52.076
And it was two hundred years old.

24:53.013 --> 24:56.843
More than two hundred years old.
Over two hundred years old.

24:59.043 --> 25:00.868
Come, let's go.

25:01.589 --> 25:03.678
Try to relax, Benny.

25:24.187 --> 25:26.233
Try to think about something else.

25:36.872 --> 25:40.917
The electric chair.
What a terrible invention.

25:41.984 --> 25:44.980
How could you come up
with such a thing?

25:45.602 --> 25:47.546
It's terrible.

26:13.773 --> 26:14.493
There.

26:15.724 --> 26:17.125
Mom!

26:18.777 --> 26:20.897
- Mom!
- What?

26:22.101 --> 26:24.116
- Mom!
- Yes.

26:31.556 --> 26:34.848
Tell us what life was like
when you were a child.

26:35.266 --> 26:38.838
How things were.

26:39.714 --> 26:43.071
Maybe there's something special
you remember that you can tell us.

26:43.844 --> 26:44.779
What?

26:46.729 --> 26:49.533
Can you tell us about your childhood...

26:49.796 --> 26:52.561
How things were when you were little.

27:01.817 --> 27:03.921
Life was hard.

27:04.726 --> 27:06.582
It was difficult.

27:07.821 --> 27:09.626
You didn't have any money.

27:13.129 --> 27:16.658
Once you had to walk
from Karlstad to Oslo.

27:17.396 --> 27:20.028
Can you tell us about that, mom?

27:23.285 --> 27:27.261
Once you had to walk
from Karlstad to Oslo.

27:27.790 --> 27:30.644
Can you tell us about that, mom?

27:33.781 --> 27:37.702
And your brother Benjamin,
who died when he was young.

27:39.526 --> 27:42.339
You liked him so very much.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.483
Your little brother Benjamin.

27:47.563 --> 27:48.952
Who's that?

27:58.063 --> 27:59.158
Mom...

28:01.046 --> 28:05.713
Just try to tell us something
of what it was like.

28:07.134 --> 28:10.080
That it wasn't always easy.

28:11.679 --> 28:12.429
Mom.

28:12.932 --> 28:15.279
Just a little.
Try, mom.

28:15.617 --> 28:17.130
Just a little.

28:18.933 --> 28:20.323
A little.

28:33.102 --> 28:35.383
It's already half-past five!

28:39.190 --> 28:41.303
What can I say?

28:42.356 --> 28:43.936
"Oh really?"

30:10.020 --> 30:12.239
Telephone for Professor Holmberg.

30:14.959 --> 30:17.382
It's his son. It's important.

30:56.445 --> 30:58.753
There is a phone call for you.

30:59.074 --> 31:01.057
It's important. It's your son.

32:33.161 --> 32:34.106
Hello!

32:35.571 --> 32:36.973
Hello Johan.

32:51.739 --> 32:56.029
But dear God, Johan.
You got money last week.

32:56.981 --> 32:58.432
Yes, you did.

32:59.915 --> 33:03.070
And I heard you asked your mother
for money as well.

33:03.962 --> 33:06.781
And not for the first time, either.

33:07.309 --> 33:09.076
Are you not ashamed, Johan?

33:09.431 --> 33:12.489
You should be,
you should be ashamed.

33:13.041 --> 33:17.202
And Eva told mother that you
borrowed money from her too.

33:17.513 --> 33:18.832
Several times.

33:19.729 --> 33:22.387
And from uncle Arvid too.

33:22.929 --> 33:25.597
That's the last the heard from you.

33:26.635 --> 33:30.096
Can't you see
you're embarrassing me?

33:30.311 --> 33:31.094
Yes, you do.

33:31.379 --> 33:34.888
You embarrass me and your mother
and your sister.

33:35.572 --> 33:37.069
Yes, you do.

33:38.067 --> 33:41.231
Yes, I'm disappointed.
Upset and unhappy.

33:42.879 --> 33:46.637
Well, what do you think?
I don't want to think the worst...

33:46.904 --> 33:49.477
I'm really beginning to do that,
Johan.

33:49.874 --> 33:53.247
Yes, I am...
and mother is too.

34:01.790 --> 34:05.228
Oh dear.
How much is it, then?

34:06.702 --> 34:11.090
I'll help you out this time too,
Johan, but then, this has to stop.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.983
I won't stand for it. Yes.

34:14.916 --> 34:16.425
Now? No.

34:17.085 --> 34:20.091
I don't have that kind of money on me.

34:20.638 --> 34:24.476
No, no. I can't.
I can't leave.

34:25.446 --> 34:28.670
It's impossible.
Yes, absolutely impossible.

34:29.976 --> 34:32.940
Yes, I'm going to give a speech.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.324
Yes, I've promised.

34:35.685 --> 34:39.731
If I don't, they'll be very
disappointed. Yes, very disappointed.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.134
Yes, yes. Johan, calm down now.

34:44.387 --> 34:47.014
It's a jubilee.

34:50.283 --> 34:51.212
Hello?

36:05.208 --> 36:06.009
Hi.

36:07.044 --> 36:09.249
- Is Micke here?
- Micke who?

36:10.356 --> 36:11.790
Micke Larsson.

36:13.241 --> 36:14.339
No.

36:15.178 --> 36:17.484
- He is the singer in Black Devils.
- What?

36:18.614 --> 36:19.858
Black Devils.

36:20.484 --> 36:23.735
There's a band that comes after us
at four o'clock.

36:26.266 --> 36:29.580
- What's your name then?
- We're called Louisiana Brass Band.

38:06.554 --> 38:09.167
You were going to call, Micke.

38:13.141 --> 38:15.785
You said you were going to call.

38:58.733 --> 39:01.367
You're such a good singer, Micke.

39:04.500 --> 39:06.392
So damn good!

40:10.360 --> 40:12.972
Holy shit.
Things are happening here.

40:13.432 --> 40:14.492
Hang on.

40:19.722 --> 40:24.057
Tobbe, did you hear that? I guess
you'll have to cancel golf today.

40:25.416 --> 40:29.338
What I'm doing?
We're sitting here celebrating.

40:29.641 --> 40:33.217
Conny Blom and me.
Fantastic lunch.

40:33.902 --> 40:37.354
And the gods are congratulating us
with thunderous applause!

40:40.186 --> 40:45.144
Very, very, good, Tobbe.
That's why I'm giving you a buzz.

40:45.469 --> 40:47.923
Listen, that boat, is it gone?

40:49.166 --> 40:51.274
I didn't think so.

40:51.475 --> 40:54.191
Not many people can put up
that kind of cash these days.

40:54.442 --> 40:56.043
But I can, Tobbe.

40:57.171 --> 41:00.409
What would your price be
if I said with no receipt?

41:01.865 --> 41:06.112
I know, I know.
Quality doesn't come cheap.

41:06.679 --> 41:10.580
"No money, no tournedous"
as the ancient Greeks used to say.

41:13.114 --> 41:15.853
What, Bordeaux?
And no Bordeaux either.

41:17.579 --> 41:20.437
No money, no tournedous
and no Bordeaux either.

41:23.067 --> 41:26.580
That's brilliant, Tobbe.
You're a goddamn poet.

41:28.357 --> 41:30.122
Conny agrees.

41:37.362 --> 41:39.559
Waiter!
Can I pay please?

41:44.510 --> 41:46.612
I am a man who enjoys quality.

41:47.168 --> 41:48.935
You know that, Tobbe.

41:49.908 --> 41:52.171
I'm bloody grateful for that.

41:52.770 --> 41:55.215
Not everyone can afford it.

41:55.881 --> 41:57.581
It's too bad.

41:58.399 --> 42:02.586
Quality is not for the common man.
Never has been, never will be.

42:03.678 --> 42:05.719
That's just the way it is.

42:06.594 --> 42:11.278
We did some really decent
business today. Really.

42:11.879 --> 42:13.822
How did that philosopher put it?

42:14.533 --> 42:18.150
You can't play nice in war
and business. Or something like that.

42:19.805 --> 42:21.049
What?

42:21.505 --> 42:25.929
We're just going to finish our brandy.
Then we'll have drinks at the Savoy.

42:26.157 --> 42:31.237
So you're bloody welcome, you'll get
a fat down payment in cash.

42:33.655 --> 42:36.240
What the hell? Hang on Tobbe. Wait.

42:59.154 --> 43:01.249
Could we perhaps take some measurements?

43:01.588 --> 43:03.393
Could we take the coat?

43:08.420 --> 43:10.235
And perhaps the jacket, too?

43:16.567 --> 43:18.661
Excuse me, my jacket!

43:27.282 --> 43:29.504
Shoulder blades nineteen.

43:30.282 --> 43:32.253
Elbows twenty-five.

43:33.279 --> 43:35.750
Waist measurement forty-three.

43:36.271 --> 43:37.976
Arm length fifty-two.

43:38.390 --> 43:40.524
Jacket length sixty-eight.

43:41.692 --> 43:43.494
And then we have this as well.

43:49.596 --> 43:51.206
A little prickly.

43:54.348 --> 43:55.852
Shoulder seventeen.

43:56.175 --> 43:57.621
Knee height thirty-nine.

44:03.255 --> 44:05.204
Leg length eighty-seven.

44:19.843 --> 44:23.314
This is what you get for your sins,
you homeless bastards.

44:29.156 --> 44:32.350
We're taking last orders now.
Last orders.

44:33.057 --> 44:35.182
Tomorrow is another day.

46:31.619 --> 46:32.977
I have a question, doctor.

46:33.387 --> 46:34.874
Lars Johansson!

46:37.102 --> 46:39.202
Take it easy. We'll call for you.

46:41.845 --> 46:42.881
Good morning!

47:09.175 --> 47:10.721
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.

47:16.203 --> 47:18.237
I am a psychiatrist.

47:18.584 --> 47:21.304
I have been for 27 years.

47:21.994 --> 47:24.647
I'm completely worn out.

47:25.362 --> 47:29.195
Year after year,
listening to patients

47:29.511 --> 47:31.948
who aren't satisfied with their lives,

47:32.285 --> 47:36.367
who want to have fun,
who want me to help them with that.

47:36.613 --> 47:38.827
It wears you out, I can tell you.

47:39.094 --> 47:41.996
My life isn't exactly
a lot of fun either.

47:42.835 --> 47:44.899
People demand so much.

47:45.209 --> 47:48.226
That's the conclusion I've drawn
after all these years.

47:48.497 --> 47:50.415
They demand to be happy,

47:50.624 --> 47:54.701
at the same time as
they are egocentric, selfish

47:55.060 --> 47:56.934
and ungenerous.

47:57.760 --> 48:00.645
Well, I would like to be honest.

48:00.922 --> 48:05.412
I would like to say
that they are quite simply mean,

48:05.927 --> 48:07.405
most of them.

48:09.809 --> 48:15.301
Spending hour after hour in therapy,
trying to make a mean person happy.

48:15.847 --> 48:17.793
There's no point.

48:18.356 --> 48:19.648
You can't do it.

48:20.098 --> 48:22.136
I've stopped doing it.

48:22.706 --> 48:25.652
These days, I just prescribe pills.

48:26.084 --> 48:28.137
The stronger the better.

48:29.382 --> 48:30.992
That's the way it is.

48:48.463 --> 48:49.826
Hi.

49:40.105 --> 49:41.455
Nobody understands me.

49:41.882 --> 49:43.759
- Nobody understands me.
- Oh, I understand.

49:43.978 --> 49:45.367
- Do you live here?
- No.

49:45.719 --> 49:48.585
Could you move?
I have to put some letters in the box.

50:15.712 --> 50:17.686
Always a pleasure to be here, Karin.

50:18.393 --> 50:20.182
Thank you, that's nice to hear.

50:21.066 --> 50:23.214
Damn, that smells good.

50:23.623 --> 50:24.757
Thanks.

50:26.157 --> 50:28.240
What a mother you have, Uffe.

50:31.628 --> 50:33.939
It's a shame she's a sadist, though.

50:34.955 --> 50:37.628
Oh my, what are you saying, Mia?

50:38.633 --> 50:40.926
- A sadist!
- Take it easy!

50:41.323 --> 50:44.008
That's someone
who likes to torment people.

50:44.556 --> 50:46.933
- And that's what I do, you mean?
- Well...

50:49.459 --> 50:51.240
How should I put it?

50:51.804 --> 50:56.888
Serving non-alcoholic beer with food
that smells so good.

50:59.213 --> 51:00.669
It's torture.

51:01.609 --> 51:04.800
I only want what's best for you.

51:05.936 --> 51:07.141
Best!

51:08.665 --> 51:10.539
Is this what's best for me,

51:11.765 --> 51:14.791
enduring this damned existence...

51:15.170 --> 51:18.170
...with all the shit and deceit...

51:18.708 --> 51:20.421
...and wickedness...

51:21.372 --> 51:23.206
...and stay sober?

51:39.410 --> 51:40.285
How can you expect...

51:42.233 --> 51:47.584
or even want...
a single poor bugger...

51:49.466 --> 51:51.303
...to put up with it...

51:52.010 --> 51:54.122
...without being drunk?

51:55.473 --> 51:57.442
It's inhuman.

51:58.612 --> 52:00.100
It's torture.

52:03.271 --> 52:07.291
- Only a sadist would demand that.
- Hey, take it easy.

52:07.843 --> 52:08.485
Take it easy.

52:13.808 --> 52:15.580
You're kind, Karin.

52:16.832 --> 52:19.805
I'm not angry with you.
You know that.

52:21.321 --> 52:23.825
It's always nice to be here.

52:31.198 --> 52:33.585
When are you getting married?

52:35.703 --> 52:37.348
Get married?

52:38.474 --> 52:40.740
What good would that do?

52:41.585 --> 52:43.760
That wouldn't help anything.

52:52.280 --> 52:54.161
Dinner will be ready soon.

52:57.152 --> 52:58.891
That'll be great.

53:40.978 --> 53:43.250
Oh, that feels good.

53:45.309 --> 53:48.589
I got a letter from the bank today.

53:49.096 --> 53:51.439
It was not a nice letter, mind you.

53:51.762 --> 53:53.434
Oh! So nice.

53:53.685 --> 53:55.758
I've been saving up for my retirement.

53:56.332 --> 53:58.494
For more than 16 years.

54:00.057 --> 54:02.692
They advised me
to put my savings in funds.

54:03.079 --> 54:04.476
So I did.

54:05.556 --> 54:10.401
All my earnings from playing
at funerals and in the military band

54:11.947 --> 54:15.044
was invested in two different funds.

54:16.802 --> 54:19.570
The bank thought it was a good idea.

54:20.578 --> 54:24.630
If one fund did poorly,
the other could do well, they said.

54:27.154 --> 54:30.301
I found out today,
neither of them did good.

54:31.118 --> 54:32.335
Quite the opposite.

54:33.597 --> 54:36.925
My retirement savings
have gone down by 34%, I was told.

54:39.058 --> 54:41.374
Quite disheartening news, I tell you.

54:42.677 --> 54:43.675
Oh! So nice.

54:43.984 --> 54:45.386
The bank agreed.

54:46.035 --> 54:47.828
They said it was unforunate.

54:48.224 --> 54:50.474
They said I'd had bad luck.

54:51.075 --> 54:53.085
Things like this happen, they said.

54:54.258 --> 54:56.418
You simply have bad luck sometimes.

54:58.390 --> 55:02.068
I have played 39 times
in the military band so far this year

55:02.818 --> 55:04.881
and played at 48 funerals.

55:06.745 --> 55:09.514
All the money went
to my retirement funds.

55:11.697 --> 55:13.948
I have been able to live off other gigs.

55:15.567 --> 55:19.472
And now I find out that my pension
is going to be a lot smaller.

55:20.562 --> 55:25.654
All the money has just gone down the drain.
It's a tragedy indeed.

55:26.415 --> 55:29.175
And this is what is going to happen.
I've worked it out...

55:29.526 --> 55:32.579
...I'm eventually going to have
to sell my car.

55:33.574 --> 55:35.319
It's really quite depressing.

57:25.521 --> 57:27.420
- It's a nice day today.
- What?

57:28.309 --> 57:30.965
- I said, it's a nice day today.
- It might be.

57:32.249 --> 57:35.394
- Sorry?
- I said it might be.

57:37.019 --> 57:38.364
And how would we like our hair cut?

57:38.650 --> 57:42.478
The same, somewhat shorter,
nothing different, Just tidy it up a bit.

57:42.944 --> 57:45.296
I'm in a hurry.
I have to go to a meeting.

57:45.523 --> 57:47.844
I see. Do you want a part?

57:48.044 --> 57:50.849
The way it is, I said.
Do I have a part now?

57:52.091 --> 57:55.272
Not exactly, but your hair does fall
somewhat towards the left.

57:55.482 --> 57:56.494
To the left?

57:56.708 --> 57:58.717
- Yes.
- It falls to the right, dammit.

58:00.597 --> 58:03.935
- Not when you look at it from here.
- I'm the one getting a hair cut.

58:04.522 --> 58:07.837
Maybe it's hard, when you are used
to reading and writing backwards.

58:09.008 --> 58:10.584
- Backwards?
- Yes.

58:11.629 --> 58:15.284
From right to left, the way you do
down there in the desert.

58:16.057 --> 58:18.542
Arabic is written from the right,
but it doesn't mean

58:18.739 --> 58:20.820
we write backwards, dammit!

58:21.052 --> 58:23.945
If a car drives across a street
from the right

58:24.217 --> 58:26.560
that doesn't mean
it's driving backwards, does it?

58:26.917 --> 58:29.283
Will you just shut up and cut?

58:30.934 --> 58:32.865
Sorry about the part...

58:33.239 --> 58:35.901
but sometimes something new
can cheer you up.

58:37.127 --> 58:38.912
If that's what I wanted
I'd have asked for that.

58:39.170 --> 58:41.575
Do I look tired or something?
What the hell do you mean?

58:42.135 --> 58:45.255
- No, not exactly.
- In that case, get going and cut.

58:49.044 --> 58:50.562
Bend your head forwards a bit.

59:03.865 --> 59:05.968
What the hell?

59:31.247 --> 59:33.646
That's him.
He's the one who did it.

59:34.664 --> 59:35.970
He's the one who did it.

59:36.832 --> 59:40.132
Do you realize what you've done?
I have a bloody important meeting.

59:40.547 --> 59:43.399
You've ruined everything,
you stupid idiot.

59:44.128 --> 59:48.534
I'm going to sue you.
I'll get the shirt off your back.

59:48.912 --> 59:52.165
Hundreds of thousands.
Get it?

59:52.987 --> 59:54.895
Take it easy, damn it, take it easy.

59:55.146 --> 59:56.296
Take it easy?

59:56.746 --> 59:57.904
What do you mean?

59:58.092 --> 59:59.659
Well, I was in a bad mood.

01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:04.492
I know, it happends sometimes
and I had a fight with my wife, too.

01:00:04.683 --> 01:00:08.533
What kind of a bloody excuse is that?
You goddamned...

01:00:08.961 --> 01:00:10.065
...bastard.

01:00:11.002 --> 01:00:14.503
Take it easy, damnit.
I'll fix it, for free.

01:00:15.082 --> 01:00:19.624
Fix it? You have ruined
a bloody important meeting for me.

01:00:20.180 --> 01:00:23.782
It'll cost you the shirt off your back.
Get it? I'll make sure of that.

01:00:24.005 --> 01:00:25.989
You bloody...

01:00:27.379 --> 01:00:31.407
Take it easy.
I'll fix it for free.

01:00:41.772 --> 01:00:43.027
Hello, Jan Molin.

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.400
Jan Molin.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:51.000
Hello, Jan Molin.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.800
- Hello, Jan Molin.
- Kristina.

01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.500
- Hello, Jan Molin.
- Hello, Sten Welander.

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:08.112
Hello.

01:01:09.124 --> 01:01:10.890
- Jan!
- Hello, Goeran.

01:01:11.118 --> 01:01:13.043
Haven't seen you for ages!

01:01:13.386 --> 01:01:15.804
- Must be eight or nine years.
- Yes.

01:01:16.281 --> 01:01:18.486
Last time I was at Atlas Copco.

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:21.725
You had more hair in those days.

01:01:22.523 --> 01:01:25.482
- Jesus, time flies.
- It really does.

01:01:25.722 --> 01:01:29.209
- Your boys, they must be...?
- No, More like this, I think.

01:01:32.364 --> 01:01:33.425
Hello.

01:01:34.971 --> 01:01:39.880
Right, Not everyone is here yet,
but we might as well sit down.

01:01:43.576 --> 01:01:44.957
Good to see you.

01:01:56.882 --> 01:01:58.610
Excuse me for being late.

01:01:59.742 --> 01:02:01.917
Hello. Lars Melander.
Head of Production.

01:02:17.214 --> 01:02:19.607
Anders Lundell, Director of Finance.

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.606
We can shake hands later.

01:02:30.598 --> 01:02:31.860
Well, my friends.

01:02:32.259 --> 01:02:36.289
We are gathered here today
to discuss a problem

01:02:36.524 --> 01:02:40.052
that we in fact share
with many other companies.

01:02:40.564 --> 01:02:42.650
Both here and abroad.

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.959
Which doesn't make things easier.

01:02:46.358 --> 01:02:48.677
In short... Things are going well
for the company.

01:02:48.915 --> 01:02:50.823
Profits are decent,

01:02:51.215 --> 01:02:53.610
but the value of our shares
is too low.

01:02:54.075 --> 01:02:58.116
That is the view of many
of our owners as well as the board.

01:02:58.810 --> 01:03:01.317
So apart from the management,

01:03:01.687 --> 01:03:04.035
we have asked you here today.

01:03:05.025 --> 01:03:08.242
Jan Molin, I've known for years.

01:03:10.692 --> 01:03:14.223
Together with Sven and the others
in management,

01:03:14.563 --> 01:03:17.560
I have looked through your offer
and suggestions very carefully.

01:03:18.547 --> 01:03:21.276
- I think it looks good.
- Thank you, that's nice to hear.

01:03:21.659 --> 01:03:27.178
Tobias Ek, Sten Welander
and Jan-Olof Abrahamsson...

01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:32.445
...have also submitted proposals for
improvement deserving consideration.

01:03:49.234 --> 01:03:51.128
If I may speak plainly,

01:03:51.645 --> 01:03:56.729
the board has expressed
its serious displeasure

01:03:57.023 --> 01:03:58.865
with the current situation.

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.923
I can't lift my arm.

01:04:14.292 --> 01:04:16.756
I can't lift my arm.

01:04:21.614 --> 01:04:23.037
I can't...

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:33.000
Goeran, Goeran!

01:04:33.743 --> 01:04:34.912
He's breathing.

01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:37.206
Goeran, are you alright?

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.551
This looks serious. Get an ambulance.

01:04:40.938 --> 01:04:42.533
Call an ambulance.

01:04:53.713 --> 01:04:59.955
<i>I have heard of a heavenly city,</i>

01:05:00.729 --> 01:05:06.505
<i>above earthly and mist-covered lands,</i>

01:05:08.084 --> 01:05:13.395
<i>of the sunblessed beaches and sands,</i>

01:05:15.277 --> 01:05:20.561
<i>and one day,
oh one day, I'll be there!</i>

01:05:22.762 --> 01:05:28.410
<i>Hallelujah, I must sing aloud.</i>

01:05:30.029 --> 01:05:35.699
<i>Hallelujah, I go to that city.</i>

01:05:37.443 --> 01:05:42.993
<i>If my footsteps grow tired and weary,</i>

01:05:45.421 --> 01:05:50.163
<i>I stride upwards
and home all the same.</i>

01:05:54.772 --> 01:05:56.260
Thank you, my best friend.

01:05:59.344 --> 01:06:05.177
<i>I have heard of a land without tears,</i>

01:06:06.543 --> 01:06:12.435
<i>without grief, without want,
without strife,</i>

01:06:14.025 --> 01:06:19.698
<i>where sickness and pain are not rife.</i>

01:06:21.465 --> 01:06:26.652
<i>And one day, oh one day,
I'll be there!</i>

01:06:50.338 --> 01:06:55.249
Farewell Goeran. Thank you...
Thank you for everything.

01:06:56.608 --> 01:06:57.425
Really.

01:07:29.103 --> 01:07:30.629
Daddy!

01:07:34.290 --> 01:07:35.724
Daddy!

01:08:20.120 --> 01:08:23.211
Lord, please Lord, forgive them.

01:08:24.504 --> 01:08:25.956
Forgive them...

01:08:27.550 --> 01:08:31.249
Forgive those
who are greedy and cheap.

01:08:31.817 --> 01:08:34.303
Forgive those
who are greedy and miserly.

01:08:34.667 --> 01:08:36.750
And those who deceive and cheat

01:08:37.473 --> 01:08:40.834
or grow rich
by paying miserable wages.

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:44.082
Dear lord, forgive them.
Forgive them.

01:08:44.886 --> 01:08:48.263
And Lord, forgive those
who humiliate and desecrate.

01:08:48.517 --> 01:08:51.393
Forgive those who torture and kill.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:55.267
Forgive those who bomb and destroy
cities and villages.

01:08:55.868 --> 01:09:00.624
Forgive those who are dishonest,
those who lie and are false.

01:09:01.884 --> 01:09:05.038
Forgive governments who withhold
the truth from the people.

01:09:05.261 --> 01:09:07.725
Dear Lord, forgive them.

01:09:08.624 --> 01:09:10.625
Forgive those who are heartless,

01:09:10.852 --> 01:09:14.314
merciless,
and quick to pass judgement.

01:09:14.536 --> 01:09:16.875
Please Lord, forgive them.

01:09:17.649 --> 01:09:22.490
Forgive courts that pass sentences
too harsh or convict the innocent.

01:09:23.171 --> 01:09:25.095
- Forgive them.
- Anna...

01:09:25.551 --> 01:09:27.234
We have to close and lock up now.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:30.807
Forgive newspapers and TV channels
that mislead.

01:09:31.044 --> 01:09:33.737
That distract attention
from that which is important.

01:09:34.107 --> 01:09:37.621
Dear Lord, forgive them.

01:09:38.448 --> 01:09:40.194
There now, Anna.
We have to close and lock up now.

01:09:40.478 --> 01:09:43.549
Dear Lord, forgive them.
Forgive them.

01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:12.684
I had a dream last night.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.029
I dreamed I married...

01:10:23.421 --> 01:10:24.939
Micke Larsson.

01:10:28.085 --> 01:10:31.636
He plays a guitar and sings
in Black Devils.

01:10:34.506 --> 01:10:35.967
It was so nice.

01:10:37.588 --> 01:10:39.168
So nice...

01:10:41.568 --> 01:10:42.888
Wonderful...

01:10:45.268 --> 01:10:46.900
Fantastic.

01:11:26.318 --> 01:11:28.673
You play so very well, Micke.

01:13:48.385 --> 01:13:49.801
- Hello!
- Hello!

01:13:50.663 --> 01:13:52.017
Congratulations!

01:13:53.127 --> 01:13:54.304
Where's Anna?

01:13:56.438 --> 01:13:57.570
She's here.

01:14:04.292 --> 01:14:05.508
Hello, Anna!

01:14:07.815 --> 01:14:10.727
- Who are you?
- We have come to congratulate you.

01:14:11.181 --> 01:14:13.595
You look nice.

01:14:13.805 --> 01:14:16.521
Cheers for the happy couple!

01:14:21.041 --> 01:14:22.741
It looks really cosy in there.

01:14:25.466 --> 01:14:29.148
- Where are you off to?
- We haven't decided yet.

01:14:29.487 --> 01:14:30.761
We'll see.

01:14:31.655 --> 01:14:34.013
Anna and Micke, best of luck.

01:14:35.105 --> 01:14:36.652
Anna and Micke, best of luck!

01:14:58.767 --> 01:15:00.777
Micke, play. Play, Micke.

01:16:08.571 --> 01:16:11.184
Everyone was so kind.

01:16:13.742 --> 01:16:16.182
Even though I didn't know them.

01:16:18.258 --> 01:16:20.154
I didn't know a single one.

01:16:22.341 --> 01:16:24.756
But they were kind all the same.

01:16:25.321 --> 01:16:27.180
So nice...

01:16:30.366 --> 01:16:34.501
They wanted things to be good
for us, me and Micke.

01:16:38.729 --> 01:16:40.633
It was so nice.

01:16:42.335 --> 01:16:43.737
So very nice.

01:16:47.211 --> 01:16:49.740
Listen up! We'll take last orders now.

01:16:50.003 --> 01:16:51.461
Last orders!

01:16:57.258 --> 01:17:02.030
The day before yesterday
I dreamed I could fly.

01:17:04.111 --> 01:17:06.828
I lay myself turned to the wind,
like this.

01:17:07.374 --> 01:17:10.898
And I flew high, high up.

01:17:12.974 --> 01:17:15.943
Up there I waved down
to mom and dad.

01:17:16.821 --> 01:17:19.419
They waved back.

01:17:20.803 --> 01:17:22.584
They were so happy.

01:17:23.515 --> 01:17:24.897
And so was I.

01:17:26.247 --> 01:17:27.968
It was lovely.

01:17:47.417 --> 01:17:49.157
Oh dear.

01:17:50.432 --> 01:17:53.422
- What?
- Oh dear, I said.

01:17:54.305 --> 01:17:55.638
Yes, yes.

01:18:06.103 --> 01:18:11.228
<i>I have heard of a heavenly city,</i>

01:18:11.832 --> 01:18:17.187
<i>above earthly and mist-covered lands,</i>

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:28.989
<i>and one day,
oh one day, I'll be there!</i>

01:18:30.082 --> 01:18:34.648
<i>I have heard of a land without tears,</i>

01:18:35.904 --> 01:18:40.433
<i>without grief, without want,

01:18:41.528 --> 01:18:46.270
<i>where sickness and pain are not rife.</i>

01:18:47.878 --> 01:18:52.386
<i>And one day, oh one day,
I'll be there!</i>

01:20:38.561 --> 01:20:40.878
You play so well, Micke.

01:20:43.895 --> 01:20:45.712
So very well.

01:20:52.285 --> 01:20:54.726
And you're a fantastic singer...

01:20:56.613 --> 01:20:58.039
So good.

01:20:59.912 --> 01:21:01.594
So very good.

01:21:17.010 --> 01:21:19.174
I love you so much, Micke...

01:21:22.833 --> 01:21:24.414
So much.

01:21:28.473 --> 01:21:30.463
So very much.

01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:22.200
Anna...

01:22:22.300 --> 01:22:24.600
Anna...

01:22:25.324 --> 01:22:27.427
Can you come and taste the gravy?
