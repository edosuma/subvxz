WEBVTT

02:26.003 --> 02:29.769
You mean, you're really gonna
bet your signed Picasso...

02:30.114 --> 02:31.672
for Taphie here?

02:32.087 --> 02:33.418
Absolutely.

02:33.489 --> 02:36.219
I had planned to take her
back to Paris with me.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.490
Why, you devil.

02:39.962 --> 02:42.931
To sponsor her for two years
at the Sorbonne.

02:44.032 --> 02:45.124
Oh.

02:45.701 --> 02:48.067
Well, let's see what you've got.

02:55.944 --> 02:57.468
Aloha, Robin.

02:57.980 --> 03:01.711
Damn. Five years of high
school right down the drain.

03:03.685 --> 03:06.347
Too bad, Robin.
Another terrible night.

03:07.289 --> 03:09.849
So far you've lost
one signed Picasso...

03:09.925 --> 03:12.485
a case of 100-year-old
Frog champagne...

03:12.561 --> 03:15.496
your master pressings of Jack
Teagarden's original songs...

03:15.564 --> 03:19.796
plus, you owe me one original story
for the next issue of my magazine.

03:19.935 --> 03:22.301
Now, what do you say?

03:22.638 --> 03:25.072
I say give me a break, Buzz.

03:25.140 --> 03:26.698
I did give you a break...

03:26.775 --> 03:28.834
in the first issue
of my magazine...

03:28.911 --> 03:30.902
22 years ago.

03:32.514 --> 03:35.278
I was the first one to publish
your first story...

03:35.350 --> 03:37.318
<i>Babes in Babylon...</i>

03:37.386 --> 03:42.153
illustrated with slightly retouched
photos of my original Buzzettes.

03:45.093 --> 03:46.651
Damn it, Mickey!

03:46.728 --> 03:49.094
I told you never to disturb me
when I'm in the game room.

03:49.164 --> 03:50.188
Now what the...

03:50.265 --> 03:51.562
Yeah. But, Uncle,
guess what?

03:51.633 --> 03:54.363
We just beat the Washington
Senators. Isn't that great?

03:54.436 --> 03:56.165
Terrific! What was the score?
17 to 3.

03:56.238 --> 03:58.365
Excuse me, but didn't
the Washington Senators...

03:58.440 --> 04:00.533
go out of existence in 1969?

04:00.609 --> 04:02.804
Not the ones up on Capitol Hill.

04:02.878 --> 04:05.244
Their softball team
played my Blasters.

04:05.314 --> 04:07.339
My co-ed softball team.

04:07.416 --> 04:11.375
Now maybe those bozos won't hold
that anti-trust bill against me.

04:12.721 --> 04:14.052
You can go now.

04:14.122 --> 04:16.886
Go polish some statues
or something. Okay, Mickey?

04:16.959 --> 04:18.324
Yes, Uncle.

04:22.364 --> 04:25.094
My niece and second cousin's
third son.

04:26.568 --> 04:28.092
I warned them about
brain damage.

04:29.438 --> 04:30.530
Your deal.

04:30.606 --> 04:34.064
You know, I've got a
pretty decent softball team myself.

04:35.544 --> 04:36.943
No kidding.

04:37.579 --> 04:39.877
I never joke about softball.

04:39.948 --> 04:42.610
My King Kamehameha
Club Paddlers.

04:42.684 --> 04:45.915
They've won their league
the last three years in a row.

04:46.188 --> 04:47.849
Island ball, huh?

04:49.224 --> 04:50.987
What do you use,
coconuts for balls, huh?

04:53.061 --> 04:54.619
Ukuleles for bats?

04:55.931 --> 04:57.193
Hardly.

04:57.532 --> 05:00.365
How can you play serious
softball on a surfboard?

05:00.435 --> 05:02.232
Hey, give me a break, will you?

05:02.304 --> 05:05.102
Actually, Buzz,
my team is quite serious.

05:07.509 --> 05:10.069
Serious enough
to recoup your losses?

05:10.612 --> 05:14.070
Friday, 2:00,
Kapalonu Park.

05:15.350 --> 05:16.715
You got it.

05:17.953 --> 05:20.751
What are you gonna put up
in case your guys lose?

05:21.390 --> 05:22.516
Name it.

05:23.592 --> 05:25.082
The estate.

05:26.311 --> 05:30.042
Mr. Masters bet the entire
estate on a softball game.

05:30.882 --> 05:32.509
It's just for a year, Higgins.

05:32.584 --> 05:35.348
The ramifications of which
seem to elude you.

05:35.420 --> 05:36.614
Think of it.

05:36.688 --> 05:41.091
The entire estate given over for a year
to a playboy of questionable reputation...

05:41.159 --> 05:44.651
and his hordes of scantily clad
models with even looser morals.

05:44.729 --> 05:46.196
Sounds terrible.

05:46.264 --> 05:47.356
And worse yet...

05:47.432 --> 05:50.401
Mr. Masters has predicated
this ridiculous wager...

05:50.468 --> 05:52.732
on your team winning a game.

05:57.642 --> 06:01.271
You know, lads, I sometimes view
myself as a latter day Job...

06:01.346 --> 06:04.042
constantly being tested
by our creator.

06:04.182 --> 06:07.777
How else could I possibly
justify four major wars...

06:07.852 --> 06:09.649
dozens of minor conflicts...

06:09.721 --> 06:12.053
seven natural disasters, and...

06:12.123 --> 06:13.954
Aha! Double play Tigers!

06:15.460 --> 06:16.688
Him.

06:19.664 --> 06:22.758
I say, Magnum, that glove must
have gone out of style with-

06:22.834 --> 06:24.199
Al Kaline.

06:24.803 --> 06:25.929
Who?

06:26.504 --> 06:27.903
Al Kaline.

06:27.973 --> 06:30.840
He's the right fielder for the
Tigers. He was the greatest.

06:30.909 --> 06:34.106
You know, I remember once,
back in June of 1956...

06:34.179 --> 06:36.704
my dad's uncle Lyle took me
to Briggs Stadium...

06:36.781 --> 06:38.874
for a Tiger game
against the Yankees.

06:38.950 --> 06:40.577
Well, Mickey Mantle
was at the plate.

06:40.652 --> 06:44.349
He just crushed an 0-2 pitch
off Paul Foytack to right.

06:44.422 --> 06:46.481
Well, Al just-
Oh, my God!

06:50.929 --> 06:52.328
Where is it?

06:54.666 --> 06:55.690
Where's what?

06:55.767 --> 06:58.793
The 110 mm lens
this cap should be covering.

06:59.771 --> 07:00.897
Higgins, I can explain-

07:00.972 --> 07:03.668
I am utterly sick and tired
of those four pathetic words:

07:03.742 --> 07:05.369
"Higgins, I can explain."

07:05.443 --> 07:08.879
I want an answer, Magnum. Do you
understand me? An answer. Now!

07:10.315 --> 07:13.512
Higgins, the lens
and the camera...

07:13.585 --> 07:17.021
are at the bottom of a
construction site on Kuhio Avenue.

07:19.024 --> 07:20.753
Mr. Masters' Nikon?

07:20.825 --> 07:22.952
But I'm gonna get a new one.
I promise, Higgins.

07:23.028 --> 07:25.792
With what? More explanations?
More promises?

07:25.864 --> 07:28.560
I'm afraid the merchants won't
take your feeble protestations...

07:28.633 --> 07:30.760
as legal tender,
and neither will I!

07:30.835 --> 07:34.362
I'll get the money, Higgins.
I know my responsibilities.

07:34.773 --> 07:38.368
Look, I'm working for Lola Stenhauser.
She's a waitress at the club.

07:38.443 --> 07:41.742
See, I'm trying to find her
ex-husband who skipped on his alimony-

07:41.813 --> 07:44.281
I don't care about
Lola Stenhauser.

07:44.349 --> 07:47.910
And I don't care about her
squalid little soap-opera life!

07:49.754 --> 07:52.245
What I care about is
Mr. Masters' camera.

07:52.323 --> 07:53.756
What I care about is the fact...

07:53.825 --> 07:56.851
that he has so cavalierly wagered
my future on this estate...

07:56.928 --> 07:59.055
on something so banal
as a softball game.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.121
My God!
It's not even cricket.

08:01.199 --> 08:03.997
And lastly, what I care about
is that my fate...

08:04.069 --> 08:06.594
indeed my whole life
as I know it...

08:06.671 --> 08:08.866
is in your clumsy hands!

08:20.885 --> 08:22.409
Come on, Lola.

08:24.155 --> 08:25.417
All right!

08:28.426 --> 08:29.950
Nice play, Lola.
All right.

08:30.028 --> 08:32.496
Come on, Rick. All strikes.
Now give them the moon ball.

08:32.563 --> 08:33.690
Okay, Keoki.

08:33.765 --> 08:34.754
Just stay loose.

08:34.832 --> 08:35.822
Get under it.

08:35.900 --> 08:36.957
Good.

08:37.034 --> 08:39.299
That's it.
Come on, Magnum.

08:41.206 --> 08:44.642
All right, boy! That's the way
to go, T.M.! That's the way to go!

08:44.709 --> 08:46.700
Roll another one in there, Rick.

08:47.178 --> 08:48.509
All strikes, huh?

08:48.580 --> 08:51.014
All right, Keoki,
try and hit this one.

08:53.718 --> 08:55.618
All right, base hit.
Come on.

08:55.687 --> 08:56.745
Nice hit, Keoki.

08:56.821 --> 08:58.288
Okay, Keoki.

08:58.356 --> 08:59.755
Bobby, you're up!

08:59.824 --> 09:01.155
Weak batter, weak batter.

09:01.226 --> 09:03.194
Come on, all
strikes now, Rick. Let's go.

09:03.261 --> 09:04.956
Throw a strike.
Come on, more arm, Rick...

09:05.029 --> 09:07.463
get it up there or else
they'll cream us every time.

09:07.532 --> 09:09.591
All right. Come
on Rick, the moon ball.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.134
Come on, Bob.

09:12.637 --> 09:13.729
Way to rip, Bobby.

09:13.805 --> 09:15.705
Come on, be a pitcher, man,
be a pitcher.

09:15.774 --> 09:17.742
Okay, Bobby, one more.
Okay, let's take two.

09:17.809 --> 09:19.367
Okay, Lola, you and me, huh?

09:19.444 --> 09:20.911
Okay.

09:22.147 --> 09:23.614
Okay, all right.

09:24.015 --> 09:26.745
It's okay. That's all right.
We'll get the next one.

09:26.818 --> 09:29.184
Come on, Lola, get your head
in the game. What's wrong?

09:29.254 --> 09:30.482
Jerome.

09:30.555 --> 09:34.150
Oh, yeah. Well, we'll
get it next time. Okay.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.125
Okay, Thomas, you're up.

09:36.194 --> 09:37.559
Okay, Thomas.

09:37.629 --> 09:38.755
Yeah, that's it.

09:38.830 --> 09:40.388
<i>Lola's head
wasn't the only one...</i>

09:40.465 --> 09:42.194
<i>that wasn't totally
into practice.</i>

09:42.267 --> 09:46.260
<i>I had other things on my mind, too,
like Higgins and the anxiety he felt...</i>

09:46.337 --> 09:49.829
<i>about having everything in his
life turned totally topsy-turvy.</i>

09:49.908 --> 09:52.502
<i>The majordomo was used to a
certain order and regimen...</i>

09:52.577 --> 09:55.978
<i>that Buzz Benoit and the Buzzettes
were certain to demolish.</i>

09:56.281 --> 09:59.216
<i>I wonder if Robin was thinking
about that when he made the bet.</i>

09:59.284 --> 10:00.774
<i>Probably not.</i>

10:02.687 --> 10:04.587
Easy out, easy out, easy out.

10:09.060 --> 10:12.791
<i>He was probably
thinking he had a pretty good team.</i>

10:12.864 --> 10:15.094
<i>And as a matter of fact,
we were.</i>

10:15.166 --> 10:16.758
<i>But the truth of it is...</i>

10:16.835 --> 10:19.429
<i>unless you play
this game every day...</i>

10:19.504 --> 10:22.268
<i>well, you're going to
be erratic.</i>

10:22.340 --> 10:24.968
Come on, T.C.!
A lizard could've caught that!

10:25.043 --> 10:26.806
I've seen better hands
on my mother.

10:26.878 --> 10:29.210
Well, maybe you ought
to bring your mom out here.

10:29.280 --> 10:31.748
At least she is a girl.
You just pitch like one.

10:31.816 --> 10:32.840
Hey.

10:32.917 --> 10:34.407
Present company excepted, Lola.

10:34.485 --> 10:36.544
Hey, Lola, come on in
and hit for a while.

10:36.621 --> 10:37.645
Okay.

10:41.860 --> 10:43.521
Go get them, huh?

10:44.829 --> 10:46.888
Nice pitching, Rick.

10:46.965 --> 10:49.433
<i>The one thing
this team did have is heart.</i>

10:49.500 --> 10:53.630
<i>And you could say that Lola Stenhauser
personified that very quality.</i>

10:53.705 --> 10:57.163
<i>She was beautiful, intelligent,
and boy, could she hit.</i>

10:58.243 --> 10:59.471
Oh, no!

10:59.711 --> 11:01.736
Oh, there goes his weekend.

11:02.914 --> 11:04.905
Oh, Rick, I'm sorry.

11:06.084 --> 11:07.847
Is it your stomach?

11:09.254 --> 11:10.949
Is it your tummy?

11:12.357 --> 11:14.621
Come on, tough it out,
Orville baby, tough it out.

11:14.692 --> 11:16.182
We better get him out of here.

11:16.261 --> 11:17.853
You all right?

11:17.929 --> 11:20.124
I'll stick with him
to see if he's okay.

11:20.198 --> 11:21.995
It's probably his stomach.

11:22.066 --> 11:23.897
Do you think he'll fire me?

11:23.968 --> 11:25.697
No, you hit too good.

11:25.770 --> 11:30.104
No. No, I bet he'll fire me. And
then I'll really be in big trouble.

11:30.174 --> 11:32.699
First, I lose my husband,
then I lose my job...

11:32.777 --> 11:34.369
then I won't be able to pay you.

11:34.445 --> 11:37.073
You don't have to pay me...
Good-bye second base.

11:37.148 --> 11:39.139
Until you find Jerome.

11:39.417 --> 11:40.475
Jerome.

11:40.551 --> 11:44.112
Lola, please. Now, don't
worry. I've got a lead.

11:44.188 --> 11:49.125
I happen to know for a fact that Jerome,
your husband, well, your ex-husband...

11:49.193 --> 11:51.491
is working construction.
So, I'm gonna find him...

11:51.562 --> 11:55.555
we'll take him to court and I'll
get your alimony back. I promise.

11:55.633 --> 11:58.261
You're gonna think I'm crazy,
Thomas...

12:00.138 --> 12:02.368
but I think I still love him.

12:03.274 --> 12:08.143
Even though he drank and ran
around and acted irresponsible...

12:08.746 --> 12:10.145
Jerome was...

12:10.214 --> 12:13.809
Well, he was Jerome.

12:14.285 --> 12:16.776
You know what I mean?
He was sweet.

12:16.988 --> 12:19.957
And even though we're divorced
and everything...

12:20.024 --> 12:22.219
I just want him back.

12:23.761 --> 12:26.525
Tell me the truth.
Am I crazy?

12:28.132 --> 12:30.464
You must be mad
if you think that you could-

12:30.535 --> 12:31.968
Yes, I think I can.

12:32.036 --> 12:33.526
Listen, maybe I am nuts.

12:33.604 --> 12:36.437
That ain't gonna stop me from
digging up those dumb orchid beds...

12:36.507 --> 12:39.135
and putting up a Tiger tent
right here on this lawn.

12:39.210 --> 12:40.507
Yes, sir.

12:40.645 --> 12:43.170
A regular three-ring
circus of sin.

12:43.348 --> 12:47.444
Robin's nest might be pretty like
it is, but I wanna make it fun.

12:47.952 --> 12:49.010
Fun?

12:49.320 --> 12:51.811
Look, I gotta stay here
for a year.

12:51.889 --> 12:54.153
I might as well enjoy it.
Are you hip?

12:54.225 --> 12:56.284
I most certainly am not.

12:56.361 --> 12:58.522
And over there,
get that, Mickey...

12:58.596 --> 13:02.157
we'll build a pleasure pool
with a series of love canals.

13:02.633 --> 13:04.658
My good man,
I must inform you-

13:04.736 --> 13:07.102
Hey, I'm gonna still
keep you on.

13:07.171 --> 13:08.399
Don't worry.

13:09.140 --> 13:11.506
That's what's bugging you,
isn't it?

13:11.576 --> 13:13.976
Well, don't you worry,
my good man.

13:14.045 --> 13:18.038
It might be kind of fun having
an English butler answer the door.

13:18.216 --> 13:21.743
You could wear one of those black
suits with the tails and stuff.

13:21.819 --> 13:24.117
Might be kind of kinky,
especially-

13:24.188 --> 13:27.885
I have no intentions of serving you as
your butler or in any other capacity...

13:27.959 --> 13:31.087
except as Mr. Masters'
representative on the island.

13:31.195 --> 13:34.460
You and your friends
are his guests.

13:35.099 --> 13:39.263
Therefore, I will seek to make your
stay as comfortable as possible.

13:39.437 --> 13:42.565
However, in so far
as the future is concerned...

13:43.107 --> 13:45.871
you still have to win
your blasted game.

13:47.578 --> 13:48.943
Hey, no problem.

13:50.681 --> 13:53.844
No problem,
T.M., win, lose, or draw...

13:54.085 --> 13:57.282
we have got it made
in the shade.

13:57.355 --> 13:58.413
Yeah.

13:58.489 --> 14:02.550
Buzzettes, Buzzettes, and more
Buzzettes for a whole year.

14:02.627 --> 14:04.993
Remember who your pals are,
Thomas.

14:05.063 --> 14:07.657
What about Higgins?
I don't think that all this-

14:07.732 --> 14:09.063
Uh-uh-uh.
It'll be good for him.

14:09.133 --> 14:11.158
Yeah, it'll loosen him up.

14:11.335 --> 14:13.963
Higgins or not,
I know one thing.

14:14.305 --> 14:16.830
This is gonna be
one hell of a year, baby.

14:18.076 --> 14:20.306
You bet your bazookas it is.

14:21.045 --> 14:22.239
I like it.

14:22.313 --> 14:24.747
I'll make this the arcade
and game room.

14:24.816 --> 14:26.215
Wait a second.

14:26.284 --> 14:27.444
I live here.

14:28.152 --> 14:29.449
Who's he?

14:30.421 --> 14:31.581
Magnum.

14:31.656 --> 14:34.124
He sometimes helps
with security.

14:34.192 --> 14:35.659
I got my own.

14:36.194 --> 14:37.786
Get rid of him after the game.

14:37.862 --> 14:38.988
Yes, Uncle.

14:39.063 --> 14:41.827
Well, what's next?
I want to see it all.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.130
Bye-bye, Buzzettes.

14:47.805 --> 14:49.466
I think we better win.

14:57.531 --> 14:59.260
Higgins, where am I gonna live?

14:59.333 --> 15:02.234
Well, I suppose you could sponge
off your friends for a year...

15:02.302 --> 15:04.532
or you could rent
a bachelor pad in Waikiki...

15:04.604 --> 15:06.538
with a nice view
of a high-rise.

15:06.806 --> 15:08.364
Or perhaps-
Come on, Higgins.

15:08.441 --> 15:11.308
We've got a real problem here and
all you're doing is making jokes.

15:11.378 --> 15:12.436
Yes.

15:12.712 --> 15:15.044
For once, we are
in agreement on something.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.946
You must win that match.

15:17.017 --> 15:18.746
Game, not match.
It's a game.

15:18.818 --> 15:20.012
Not to me, it isn't.

15:20.086 --> 15:22.611
That vulgarian and his
exhibitionistic entourage...

15:22.689 --> 15:25.817
are on the verge of driving me
and the lads stark, raving mad.

15:25.892 --> 15:28.520
If he wins, I will, of course,
have to resign.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.621
For I cannot stay here under
these wretched conditions.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.723
Lagoons of love, indeed.

15:33.900 --> 15:35.128
You must win.

15:35.202 --> 15:38.467
Don't worry, Higgins. Me and the guys
are gonna do everything we can to win.

15:38.538 --> 15:40.301
You can count on us.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.574
And them.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.645
Look, they're a joke.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.824
You see, Higgins? All
that paranoia over nothing.

15:58.892 --> 16:02.259
Just a couple of rich guys
making some silly bet.

16:02.629 --> 16:06.656
Buzz and his exhibitionistic
entourage, they come to Hawaii...

16:06.733 --> 16:09.930
they have fun for a week, they
lose the game, they go home.

16:10.003 --> 16:13.336
Yeah, sure, it's a bit
of an inconvenience for us...

16:13.406 --> 16:16.341
but it's these tough little
jobs that come up in life...

16:16.409 --> 16:20.175
that you and I have to do every
so often that build character.

16:20.247 --> 16:22.579
As a matter of fact, Higgins...

16:22.916 --> 16:25.407
I think this might be
good for us.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.178
Bye.

16:28.521 --> 16:31.490
Magnum, wait.
Aren't you going to practice?

16:31.791 --> 16:34.225
Later. I gotta find
somebody first.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.467
<i>And that somebody
was Jerome Stenhauser.</i>

16:42.535 --> 16:44.662
<i>I hadn't forgotten
my case for Lola.</i>

16:44.738 --> 16:48.299
<i>I also hadn't forgotten about the
last time I'd gone looking for him.</i>

16:48.375 --> 16:52.402
<i>I'd ended up jumping out of the way of
a swinging crane and lost the camera.</i>

16:52.479 --> 16:55.380
<i>These construction workers
tend to distrust outsiders.</i>

16:55.448 --> 16:58.576
<i>That's why I thought I'd try to
talk to a couple of the guys...</i>

16:58.652 --> 17:01.052
<i>in an atmosphere
they'd be comfortable in.</i>

17:01.121 --> 17:05.022
<i>Where they'd be more likely to be
receptive to an honest appeal for help.</i>

17:12.832 --> 17:14.128
Hi, guys.

17:16.368 --> 17:17.858
Beer, please.

17:18.738 --> 17:22.230
I think you made a mistake. I think
you want the bar down the street.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.537
No. I'm in the right place.

17:28.281 --> 17:30.078
I'm looking for
Jerome Stenhauser.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.617
Never heard of him.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.216
Well, he's a welder.
A high beam man.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.278
We're all high beam men.

17:42.329 --> 17:45.730
Well, I heard he might be
working the Kuhio site.

17:45.799 --> 17:47.994
I think you heard wrong.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.427
Finish your beer and blow.

17:58.778 --> 18:03.715
Well, I was hoping I
wouldn't have to do this, but-

18:03.783 --> 18:07.048
Well, whatever it is,
I'm quaking in my boots.

18:07.120 --> 18:10.521
Wallace McNurty, State
Bureau of Construction Safety.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.288
I'm gonna have to take
all your names.

18:13.560 --> 18:14.549
What for?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.094
Lunchtime drinking.

18:16.296 --> 18:19.459
We've been having far too many
incidents of after-lunch accidents...

18:19.532 --> 18:21.659
due to the consumption
of alcoholic beverages.

18:21.735 --> 18:25.136
This is a cooperative program
between the state and your union.

18:27.140 --> 18:31.509
Actually, it's this Stenhauser
who we've had the most reports on.

18:31.578 --> 18:34.877
But since you guys can't
help me out, I guess I'll-

18:42.655 --> 18:44.122
Koko Head Plaza.

18:44.524 --> 18:45.650
What?

18:49.362 --> 18:51.193
That's where
you can find Jerome.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.255
He works the 6:00 a. M.
Shift there.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.200
Probably gone now, but you
can catch him in the morning.

18:56.269 --> 18:59.261
How come you didn't run
like the rest of them?

18:59.339 --> 19:00.567
Retired.

19:01.307 --> 19:02.399
Retired, huh?

19:02.475 --> 19:03.567
Officially, yes.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.838
Boy, you've had
some interesting life.

19:05.912 --> 19:09.006
But on occasion, Her Majesty
still requests my services.

19:09.082 --> 19:11.277
Wow, do you have a 00 number?

19:16.255 --> 19:17.813
By the way, did I tell you?

19:17.890 --> 19:19.828
My uncle wants you to make up
10 new rooms by tonight.

19:19.853 --> 19:22.414
Ten? More Buzzettes?

19:22.461 --> 19:24.429
Well, not exactly.
Where is he?

19:24.497 --> 19:25.862
In the den.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.398
Oh, my God!
What are you doing?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.438
August.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.609
But she's...

19:41.447 --> 19:43.881
I call her
"Beauty and the Beasts."

19:44.517 --> 19:46.917
She's not wearing anything.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.088
With my Victoria Cross.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.417
Catchy, huh?

19:52.892 --> 19:54.985
And she's not even English.

19:55.728 --> 19:59.391
Relax, baby. Come on, show me some
teeth, honey. Show me some teeth.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.463
Lads. Lads,
come at once.

20:04.570 --> 20:05.730
Lads!

20:07.139 --> 20:08.299
Lads!

20:08.474 --> 20:11.170
Hey, don't forget those
10 new rooms, okay?

20:11.244 --> 20:12.973
Atta girl.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.171
Lads.

20:15.915 --> 20:18.110
Oh, Thomas, I love you.

20:18.284 --> 20:20.081
Now, when are you gonna see him?

20:20.152 --> 20:22.245
Tomorrow before he starts work.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.755
Great. And you'll tell me what
he said at softball practice?

20:24.824 --> 20:25.882
You got it.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.586
Thomas, the timing
couldn't be better.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.458
Our last practice
before the big game...

20:31.530 --> 20:34.761
and I'm going to get reunited
with the man I love.

20:34.834 --> 20:35.994
Thank you.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.160
You're welcome.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.294
Thank you.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.368
Wait a second.
What?

20:41.474 --> 20:43.408
Is tomorrow Friday?

20:44.977 --> 20:45.966
Uh-huh.

20:46.212 --> 20:48.009
Be careful.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.379
Jerome doesn't like Fridays.

20:50.449 --> 20:51.473
What?

20:51.550 --> 20:54.348
Never has. They're
his bad luck day. What?

20:54.420 --> 20:56.547
Just be careful.

20:56.622 --> 20:58.817
Sometimes
Jerome is kind of weird.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.052
Kind of weird, Lola?
Excuse me.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.061
Lola?

21:03.262 --> 21:05.628
Hey, Thomas.
We got some real trouble.

21:05.698 --> 21:06.790
Why?

21:06.866 --> 21:11.098
The Blasters are in town and by
Friday night, everybody will know it.

21:11.837 --> 21:13.270
Smile, guys.

21:15.975 --> 21:17.408
Now grimace.

21:19.345 --> 21:20.539
Ringers.

21:21.213 --> 21:22.908
Now sneer.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.712
Ringers?

21:27.320 --> 21:28.912
Now snarl.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.080
Mercenaries.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.119
Good.

21:40.882 --> 21:43.646
Look at those arcs.
Incredible.

21:44.486 --> 21:46.010
Steroid city.

21:48.457 --> 21:50.391
Here it is. Hustle, hustle!

21:51.293 --> 21:52.658
All right!

21:53.061 --> 21:55.222
Hey, those guys
are gonna cream us.

21:55.297 --> 21:57.663
Come on, what makes you say
that? We're not that bad.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.200
Yeah, but we ain't
that good either.

21:59.267 --> 22:02.464
Those guys can run, hit, field without
even getting their uniforms dirty.

22:02.537 --> 22:04.198
Yeah, but they
don't have any class.

22:04.272 --> 22:06.001
Just a bunch of ringers.

22:06.074 --> 22:08.201
That will be a lot of comfort
to Higgins and T.M...

22:08.276 --> 22:11.040
when they go thumbing through the
classifieds looking for new pads.

22:11.113 --> 22:13.206
Nobody's gonna be looking
for any new pads.

22:13.281 --> 22:15.306
I'll just talk to Buzz...

22:15.384 --> 22:19.115
and between me and him and
Robin, we'll work something out.

22:19.221 --> 22:22.088
I mean, sure, Buzz may be
a little eccentric...

22:22.157 --> 22:25.422
but he's not gonna wanna cheat
an old friend like Robin.

22:25.494 --> 22:27.223
Hey, a bet's a bet.

22:27.429 --> 22:30.887
We had a handshake,
a gentleman's agreement.

22:31.099 --> 22:33.067
But Robin's team, our team...

22:33.135 --> 22:35.296
is a bunch of guys and girls
who work for Robin.

22:35.370 --> 22:38.430
Yours are a bunch of ringers.
That's not fair.

22:38.907 --> 22:42.138
My God, pal, I think you've
just hit on the secret of life.

22:44.780 --> 22:48.307
Look, I'm gonna be
real fair about this.

22:48.617 --> 22:50.107
I don't have to, either.

22:50.185 --> 22:53.882
But you can go out and get anybody
you want to play on your team.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.445
I don't care.

22:55.524 --> 22:56.991
I just never want it
to be said that...

22:57.059 --> 23:00.256
Buzz Benoit never gave a fella
an even break.

23:00.328 --> 23:01.420
Okay?

23:01.496 --> 23:03.555
But the game is tomorrow.

23:04.166 --> 23:06.498
Hey, you better
start hustling, Magnum.

23:07.069 --> 23:09.299
Gin.
You lose, Mickey.

23:10.205 --> 23:11.934
Listen, you better start
concentrating.

23:12.007 --> 23:14.066
That's three weeks salary
I don't have to pay you for.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.302
I know.

23:15.911 --> 23:18.243
Aloha, Magnum.
See you at the game.

23:18.613 --> 23:19.671
Bye, Magnum.

23:19.748 --> 23:20.976
Bye, Mickey.

23:27.289 --> 23:29.849
<i>I know what you're
thinking and you're right.</i>

23:29.925 --> 23:31.654
<i>We spent the rest of the day
and night...</i>

23:31.727 --> 23:33.558
<i>scouting the island for ringers.</i>

23:33.628 --> 23:35.619
<i>And no one would touch us.</i>

23:35.697 --> 23:37.927
<i>So now the game
was only a few hours off...</i>

23:37.999 --> 23:41.025
<i>and I was unable to reach Robin
to try to have him cancel it.</i>

23:41.103 --> 23:43.367
<i>Somewhere in the south of
France, his secretary said.</i>

23:43.438 --> 23:45.338
<i>About the only thing
that was going right...</i>

23:45.407 --> 23:47.375
<i>was the case
for Lola Stenhauser...</i>

23:47.442 --> 23:51.310
<i>and I had to admit that that seemed
real insignificant at the moment.</i>

23:51.713 --> 23:55.114
<i>Well, at least someone was going
to be happy at practice today.</i>

23:55.217 --> 23:57.981
<i>I just hoped
Jerome was big on reunions.</i>

23:58.620 --> 23:59.780
Hi, guy.

23:59.855 --> 24:02.016
Jerome Stenhauser?

24:02.557 --> 24:03.615
Who's talking?

24:03.692 --> 24:06.388
I'm Thomas Magnum.
I'm a friend of Lola's and-

24:07.796 --> 24:10.060
<i>I guess Jerome
wasn't big on reunions.</i>

24:10.132 --> 24:12.828
<i>But I wasn't big on being
belted in the jaw, either.</i>

24:12.901 --> 24:13.925
<i>And come to think of it...</i>

24:14.002 --> 24:15.833
<i>why should this case
have been any easier...</i>

24:15.904 --> 24:17.963
<i>than anything else had been
the last couple of days?</i>

24:18.039 --> 24:20.234
<i>Maybe this was fate's way
of pouring it on.</i>

24:20.308 --> 24:23.141
<i>Only thing is, I wasn't sure
what I'd done wrong.</i>

24:34.856 --> 24:35.914
I hate lawyers!

24:35.991 --> 24:37.185
I'm not a lawyer!

24:37.259 --> 24:38.783
Did I say I was a lawyer?

24:38.860 --> 24:41.852
I said I was a friend of
Lola's. She asked me to find you.

24:41.930 --> 24:43.261
I don't want be found.

24:43.331 --> 24:44.457
I can see that.

24:44.533 --> 24:46.763
You just tell her
I'll pay her back the money.

24:46.835 --> 24:48.632
I don't care if I have
to work three shifts.

24:48.703 --> 24:51.297
She doesn't care about the
money. She cares about you.

24:51.373 --> 24:52.897
No, you lie!

24:52.974 --> 24:55.204
All you do is want the money.

24:56.378 --> 24:57.504
Fine.

24:58.713 --> 25:01.739
Go ahead and take it.
I don't give a damn.

25:02.450 --> 25:04.418
It's Friday. Payday.

25:05.687 --> 25:08.451
God! Nothing good
ever happens on Friday.

25:08.523 --> 25:10.218
Nothing ever!

25:10.358 --> 25:12.383
Now, even my money's gone.

25:12.994 --> 25:15.929
Fine. I'll tell you what, why don't
I just go sleep in the streets?

25:15.997 --> 25:19.455
That way I never have to see
another Friday or Lola again.

25:19.534 --> 25:20.728
Or you!

25:21.036 --> 25:22.526
Oh, my God!

25:24.239 --> 25:27.174
You're Jerome
"Bad Friday" Kappelwitz.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.809
Who told you?
You just did.

25:30.879 --> 25:33.871
That and the way you swung that
two-by-four, I should have known.

25:33.949 --> 25:37.646
Lola Stenhauser's married to
Jerome "Bad Friday" Kappelwitz.

25:37.819 --> 25:39.719
I prefer "Killer".

25:39.988 --> 25:41.580
Yeah. Yeah.

25:41.656 --> 25:44.489
How long you been out of ball?
What, four-five years.

25:44.559 --> 25:47.551
Six years, two months, 14 days.

25:47.629 --> 25:49.722
Yeah.
You were with the White Sox.

25:49.798 --> 25:53.029
You hit 35 home runs and
then you quit because you...

25:53.368 --> 25:54.494
Because you...

25:54.569 --> 25:57.367
Because I broke the face of
that lousy reporter in Cleveland!

25:57.439 --> 25:59.031
He wrote bad things about me.

25:59.107 --> 26:01.598
Yeah. He said
you couldn't hit on Fridays.

26:01.676 --> 26:03.507
No, not that there's any truth
to that...

26:03.578 --> 26:05.842
but he's the guy who stuck
that nickname on you.

26:05.914 --> 26:08.815
Yeah, well, he can't brag
about that anymore.

26:12.554 --> 26:14.488
Are you really
a friend of Lola's?

26:14.556 --> 26:16.786
No kidding, Killer,
I'm on the level.

26:16.858 --> 26:18.485
Look,
I'm a private investigator.

26:18.560 --> 26:21.791
But I also play on the same
softball team that Lola does...

26:21.863 --> 26:24.730
and she asked me to find you.
She hired me, in fact.

26:24.799 --> 26:27.962
See, she said she doesn't
want the money, she loves you.

26:28.036 --> 26:29.765
She wants you back.

26:30.305 --> 26:33.069
She sure could play
a sweet second base.

26:35.176 --> 26:36.700
Look, Killer...

26:40.548 --> 26:43.642
maybe we could arrange
some kind of a deal.

26:44.786 --> 26:46.515
What kind of deal?

26:47.689 --> 26:52.092
Well, I just happen to be
close personal friends...

26:52.160 --> 26:55.391
with the owner of one of the
most prestigious softball teams...

26:55.463 --> 26:56.623
in Hawaii.

26:59.267 --> 27:03.761
Killer, how would you like to
hit a ball again?

27:15.884 --> 27:17.146
Awesome.

27:18.320 --> 27:20.481
That's nothing.
Watch this.

27:29.698 --> 27:31.188
Can he pitch?

27:42.644 --> 27:45.306
Try that again.
Give me your best.

27:53.955 --> 27:57.755
<i>For the first time in
a long, long while, I felt good.</i>

27:57.826 --> 28:01.660
<i>Not just because we had our own ringer
to combat all of Buzz's Benoit's...</i>

28:01.730 --> 28:03.721
<i>but because
for the first time...</i>

28:03.798 --> 28:07.097
<i>I had the feeling that our
future was in our own hands.</i>

28:07.168 --> 28:09.796
<i>I couldn't wait
for the game to start.</i>

28:09.938 --> 28:14.170
<i>But most of all, I couldn't wait
to see the look on Lola's face...</i>

28:14.509 --> 28:17.034
<i>when she saw
the "Killer" himself.</i>

28:22.283 --> 28:23.648
Lola. Honey.

28:25.453 --> 28:26.977
You lousy jerk!

28:30.191 --> 28:31.385
Oh, no!

28:34.129 --> 28:35.357
Killer.

28:39.501 --> 28:40.866
Oh, honey.

28:42.871 --> 28:44.065
Jerome?

28:44.239 --> 28:46.173
Killer, did I hurt you?

28:51.645 --> 28:53.044
We gotta get him a doctor.

28:53.113 --> 28:55.104
No doctors.
I told you that.

28:55.182 --> 28:58.743
I've never seen a doctor in my whole
life and I'm not gonna start now.

28:58.819 --> 29:00.810
Even if I'm seeing
two of everything.

29:00.888 --> 29:03.254
What?
I think I have double vision.

29:03.323 --> 29:04.722
Oh, no!

29:05.559 --> 29:08.995
Honey, I'm sorry.
Really. Oh, honey.

29:09.062 --> 29:10.689
Why'd you have to go and bop me?

29:10.764 --> 29:12.595
Because I love you.

29:12.766 --> 29:14.961
No. I mean,
because I hate you.

29:15.035 --> 29:17.299
I don't know.
I'm so confused.

29:17.371 --> 29:20.863
It's just my feelings are so
strong, I got carried away.

29:20.941 --> 29:23.307
I'll say.
What'd you have in that purse?

29:23.377 --> 29:24.935
My week's tips.

29:25.012 --> 29:26.843
I guess Fridays really are
bad luck for him.

29:26.914 --> 29:29.508
It doesn't look so good for us
either. The game's in an hour.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.107
I don't know
what we're gonna do.

29:31.185 --> 29:32.914
It looks like
it's just hopeless.

29:32.986 --> 29:34.044
Not quite.

29:34.121 --> 29:37.454
Bleak, grim, dismal,
but not hopeless.

29:37.691 --> 29:40.057
The Killer's symptoms
are reminiscent of those...

29:40.127 --> 29:43.426
suffered by a Corporal Abbott
in Madagascar some years ago.

29:43.597 --> 29:46.589
'48 it was, or was it '49?

29:47.501 --> 29:50.902
At any rate, I think I have just the
remedy to alleviate his condition.

29:50.971 --> 29:52.802
You better start alleviating,
Higgie baby...

29:52.873 --> 29:55.068
because the Blasters
just blew in.

30:00.247 --> 30:02.772
Yes. Well,
time to get started.

30:03.050 --> 30:05.985
If you'll remove your shoes,
Mr. Kappelwitz.

30:06.053 --> 30:07.611
My shoes?
Quite.

30:11.091 --> 30:13.025
This way, ladies.
Drinks are on me.

30:13.093 --> 30:14.617
Come on, let's go.

30:16.930 --> 30:19.023
You sure you know
what you're doing, Higgins?

30:19.099 --> 30:20.088
Of course.

30:20.167 --> 30:22.431
We're talking about
his head not his foot.

30:22.502 --> 30:23.469
I know that.

30:23.537 --> 30:25.061
Well, then what are you doing?

30:25.138 --> 30:26.765
Acupressure, of course.

30:26.840 --> 30:28.740
Oh, yeah?
Then where's the needles?

30:28.809 --> 30:31.471
I said acupressure,
not acupuncture.

30:31.845 --> 30:33.176
In layman's terms...

30:33.247 --> 30:36.444
the procedure is to exert surface
pressure on various nerve endings...

30:36.516 --> 30:39.713
to relieve suffering and pain
at the other end of the line.

30:41.288 --> 30:42.482
Wrong nerve.

30:42.556 --> 30:44.581
Well, needless to say,
it's been quite a while...

30:44.658 --> 30:46.819
since I've had an occasion
to practice this procedure.

30:46.893 --> 30:48.918
Nevertheless, Corporal Abbott
went on to lead...

30:48.996 --> 30:50.691
a totally normal
and productive life.

30:50.764 --> 30:53.790
Higgins, the game starts
in ten minutes.

30:54.201 --> 30:56.829
I know that.
I'm coaching third base.

30:57.304 --> 30:58.498
You? Who said?

30:58.572 --> 30:59.732
I say.

30:59.806 --> 31:01.899
Everything I have
is also at stake here.

31:01.975 --> 31:04.739
Therefore, I feel that
I should be part of the team.

31:04.811 --> 31:07.143
That's great but what do
you know about baseball?

31:07.214 --> 31:08.738
Haven't I told you
about the time...

31:08.815 --> 31:11.045
when a shipment of balls
and bats and gloves...

31:11.118 --> 31:14.110
was mistakenly delivered to our
unit? Well, as you can imagine-

31:14.187 --> 31:15.415
Higgins!

31:17.924 --> 31:20.119
May I have your palm,
Mr. Kappelwitz?

31:31.004 --> 31:34.269
I can see normal again.
I can see!

31:35.976 --> 31:37.841
Let's go get those Blasters!

31:45.686 --> 31:47.085
Play ball.

31:47.487 --> 31:49.079
Go, hitter. Come on, Killer.

31:49.156 --> 31:51.750
Come on, Killer, baby.
Lay it in here, sweetheart.

31:51.825 --> 31:55.022
Okay, Killer. Three
up, three down. Come on, guys.

31:55.529 --> 31:56.689
Strike three.

31:56.763 --> 31:58.890
Way to go, Killer!

31:58.965 --> 32:01.297
All right,
looking good. One down.

32:01.368 --> 32:03.359
Where'd they get this guy?

32:03.904 --> 32:05.098
Unc!

32:05.806 --> 32:08.036
Unc! Unc!

32:08.108 --> 32:09.166
Shut up.

32:09.242 --> 32:12.143
Come on, Killer,
bring it on home! Let's go!

32:12.446 --> 32:13.811
Let's go.

32:15.549 --> 32:18.416
You got it, Lola.
All yours. Give her room.

32:20.320 --> 32:22.754
All right,
honey! Way to go, Lola!

32:24.491 --> 32:25.617
All right.

32:28.261 --> 32:29.956
Come on, Killer.

32:36.370 --> 32:37.928
Way to go, Killer, baby.

32:38.004 --> 32:41.405
Who the heck is this guy?
I know him.

32:41.508 --> 32:45.069
Unc. Unc! Unc!

32:45.379 --> 32:48.143
Shut up! You sound like
a seal in heat.

32:50.117 --> 32:51.345
Batter up.

32:51.418 --> 32:53.750
Come on, Thomas. Big hit.

32:53.820 --> 32:55.549
Okay, T.M.
Bottom of the second.

32:55.622 --> 32:57.715
Start it off, babes,
start it off.

33:00.427 --> 33:01.792
Oh, nice hit.

33:03.397 --> 33:05.092
Way to go, Thomas.

33:08.602 --> 33:11.571
Lead off double.
Way to go, team, way to go.

33:13.039 --> 33:15.564
Come on, Killer, bring me in.

33:16.610 --> 33:18.168
All the way in. Yeah.

33:19.112 --> 33:21.808
Way to go, honey. Run!

33:22.983 --> 33:24.473
Get the ball.

33:28.355 --> 33:30.346
Damn it!
I know who he is. He's-

33:30.424 --> 33:32.289
He's Karl "Killer" Kappelwitz.

33:32.359 --> 33:34.793
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

33:34.861 --> 33:38.388
We did that story on him
after he beat up that guy in...

33:38.532 --> 33:39.760
Cleveland.

34:57.544 --> 34:59.136
Okay, guys, let's go.

34:59.212 --> 35:01.009
Ninth inning.
Three up, three down.

35:01.081 --> 35:03.549
Come on, Killer.
Get rid of these turkeys.

35:06.219 --> 35:08.847
All right, Killer! You and me!

35:08.922 --> 35:12.414
Come on, three outs to go. Let her
rip, big guy, three up, three down.

35:12.492 --> 35:15.256
Okay, Killer, you got
them, huh? One, two, three.

35:16.730 --> 35:18.595
I love you, honey.

35:20.333 --> 35:22.028
Hey, Bad Friday!

35:24.571 --> 35:26.698
Did you forget what day it is?

35:26.773 --> 35:29.241
Gentlemen, do your duty.

35:31.578 --> 35:35.207
Jerome Leroy Kappelwitz
a. K.a. Jerome Stenhauser?

35:35.282 --> 35:36.476
Yeah, who's talking?

35:36.550 --> 35:39.212
Deputy Federal Marshal
Homer Knowlton.

35:39.786 --> 35:42.812
There's an outstanding felony
bench warrant for your arrest...

35:42.889 --> 35:45.380
from the municipality
of Cleveland, Ohio.

35:45.725 --> 35:47.590
Come with us,
Mr. Kappelwitz.

35:49.262 --> 35:51.025
Hey, come on.
Wait a second.

35:51.097 --> 35:52.394
What did he do?

35:52.465 --> 35:56.128
He broke the face of a beat reporter
on the Cleveland <i>Globe.</i>

35:56.202 --> 35:57.965
Oh, Killer.

35:58.138 --> 36:01.301
Hey, that was six years ago.
I was young and impetuous.

36:02.742 --> 36:04.300
I'm sorry, all right?

36:05.111 --> 36:07.136
You tell it to the judge, huh?

36:07.213 --> 36:09.807
Well, what about
the statute of limitations?

36:09.883 --> 36:12.317
What are you talking about?
That's in New York City.

36:12.385 --> 36:13.511
Take him away.

36:13.587 --> 36:15.020
No!

36:15.088 --> 36:17.056
As Mr. Masters' representative
on this island...

36:17.123 --> 36:19.387
I insist you let him
pitch out the inning.

36:19.459 --> 36:22.223
He'll pitch, all right,
in Leavenworth.

36:22.295 --> 36:25.230
Come on, Buzz, what do
you say? Will you wait?

36:25.432 --> 36:26.490
Please.

36:26.566 --> 36:28.158
Yeah. Come on, please.

36:28.702 --> 36:32.399
Hey, Unc, you know, maybe you
ought to let-Can it, camel-face.

36:33.073 --> 36:35.337
Hey, ease up on the kid,
will you, Buzz?

36:35.408 --> 36:37.376
Oh, I'll ease up on him,
all right.

36:37.444 --> 36:40.572
Just like I'm gonna ease up
on you jokers. Take him away.

36:40.647 --> 36:43.411
You Paddlers are history.
History.

36:46.453 --> 36:47.852
Why, Killer?

36:48.521 --> 36:51.820
Because he wrote bad things
about me in the Friday edition.

36:52.459 --> 36:54.791
He hasn't changed a bit.

36:57.697 --> 36:59.255
What do we do now?

36:59.332 --> 37:01.527
Well, I guess
we'll just have to hold them.

37:01.601 --> 37:04.536
We've got a five run lead.
Three outs to go. No problem.

37:04.604 --> 37:06.367
Hey, Rick, come on.

37:07.173 --> 37:11.507
Now listen, no walks.
Just let them hit.

37:58.158 --> 38:01.184
It's okay, Rick, next batter.
No problem.

38:10.470 --> 38:12.165
You're out!

38:12.772 --> 38:14.069
You're out!

38:16.676 --> 38:19.372
Big batting out.
Let's go get them.

38:31.958 --> 38:34.927
Well, it was a good ride
while it lasted.

38:36.496 --> 38:39.090
Hey, come by after the game.

38:39.165 --> 38:41.326
I'll fix you up a cot
in the back of the hangar.

38:41.401 --> 38:44.370
Come on, T.C., with my connections,
I can get him a nice condo.

38:44.437 --> 38:45.768
Real nice.

38:45.872 --> 38:47.533
Hey, you, too, Higgins.

38:48.341 --> 38:50.809
But about the lads...

38:53.580 --> 38:54.945
Batter up!

38:55.548 --> 38:57.038
I'll show them.

38:57.117 --> 38:58.414
Come on, Lola. Go get them.

38:58.485 --> 39:01.010
Get one for Killer, babe.
One for Killer.

39:01.087 --> 39:04.181
Keoki, you're on deck.
Rick, you're in the hole.

39:05.592 --> 39:07.924
Come on, Higgins, get out there.

39:08.528 --> 39:10.553
Higgins, this is our lives.

39:11.030 --> 39:12.520
You want some?

39:17.704 --> 39:20.070
Okay, Lola, it only takes one.

39:20.807 --> 39:22.604
Okay, Lola, let's go. Lola.

39:22.675 --> 39:24.267
Come on, Lola.

39:24.978 --> 39:26.878
Go, Lola! Go! Go!

39:28.581 --> 39:29.673
You're out!

39:29.849 --> 39:31.680
Out? How unfair!

39:31.751 --> 39:35.209
Her foot was on the bag!
She was out by a mile.

39:35.288 --> 39:37.722
Nice try, Lola.
Come on, hustle back.

39:37.791 --> 39:39.258
Let's go!

39:40.059 --> 39:42.084
Keoki, it only takes one.

39:43.062 --> 39:44.654
Slam it out there!

39:45.131 --> 39:46.996
Come on, Keoki!

39:55.008 --> 39:57.909
Now we celebrate.
Open it up, Mickey.

40:00.780 --> 40:01.872
Rick.

40:02.649 --> 40:06.016
Now look, three runs down, we
need a base runner. I want you to-

40:06.085 --> 40:08.576
If I were you, I'd put in
a pinch hitter for him.

40:08.655 --> 40:09.713
Yeah!

40:10.890 --> 40:13.415
He's right, Magnum.
At least give it a shot.

40:16.930 --> 40:20.525
Yeah. Get Smokey
or Phil or somebody.

40:20.800 --> 40:21.994
Anybody.

40:22.068 --> 40:24.059
What do you say, Magnum?

40:24.504 --> 40:26.062
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

40:26.139 --> 40:28.630
<i>Here's where I have to
step in and talk to the team.</i>

40:28.708 --> 40:31.404
<i>Motivate us on to victory
with a Knute Rockne speech...</i>

40:31.477 --> 40:34.469
<i>and most of all,
stick up for my buddy, Rick.</i>

40:35.782 --> 40:38.546
<i>Okay, I'm not going to
disappoint you.</i>

40:40.453 --> 40:41.545
Guys.

40:42.755 --> 40:45.690
Guys, I know
it doesn't look too good.

40:45.758 --> 40:47.749
It's two outs,
bottom of the ninth...

40:47.827 --> 40:49.852
we're three runs down,
our worst hitter's up.

40:49.929 --> 40:53.262
But I know that
we can come back...

40:53.366 --> 40:55.596
because this team's got heart.

40:55.768 --> 40:57.395
We got guts...

40:57.503 --> 41:00.666
and we've got the best bunch of
ballplayers this side of Koko Head.

41:00.740 --> 41:02.139
Except Rick.

41:02.842 --> 41:06.505
Oh, yeah, I know.
But he's a part of this team.

41:09.716 --> 41:11.616
And that's it, guys.
The team.

41:11.684 --> 41:14.118
That's what's important.
Not just any individual.

41:14.187 --> 41:15.654
I mean,
even a great like Killer...

41:15.722 --> 41:19.681
don't forget,
we scored 10 runs this game.

41:20.059 --> 41:22.823
Yeah, and Killer drove in
seven of them.

41:23.630 --> 41:25.461
Yeah, I know.

41:25.732 --> 41:28.792
But I also know that we got
to go out of here fighting.

41:28.868 --> 41:31.359
We got to go out of here
with our heads held high.

41:31.437 --> 41:33.302
We got to go out proud.

41:33.373 --> 41:36.809
And the only way to do that is to
send Rick here out to that plate...

41:36.876 --> 41:39.970
because he is the heart
and soul of this team.

41:41.781 --> 41:44.682
Now come on, guys.
You gotta get with the team.

41:44.817 --> 41:48.275
We'll go out tough
and we'll win this one for...

41:49.756 --> 41:50.950
For...

41:52.358 --> 41:53.620
For Killer!

41:56.229 --> 41:58.857
And all day off tomorrow,
with pay.

42:05.004 --> 42:06.494
Come on, Rick.

42:07.040 --> 42:09.406
All right, Rick.
It may be your pitch, huh?

42:09.475 --> 42:11.375
Go get them.
Come on, guys!

42:15.648 --> 42:18.048
All right, you rummies,
throw it in here.

42:23.556 --> 42:26.457
All right, Rick.
Base hit. Way to go, buddy.

42:29.696 --> 42:32.130
Come on, T.C.,
you gotta get me in there.

42:32.198 --> 42:33.426
You hit them.

42:47.380 --> 42:48.779
He's safe.

42:52.018 --> 42:54.418
Come on, Thomas.
Home run ties it up.

42:54.487 --> 42:56.352
Right on, Thomas.
Rip it.

42:56.422 --> 42:57.684
Come on!

42:58.624 --> 43:01.354
<i>The last time I
was in a situation like this...</i>

43:01.427 --> 43:04.191
<i>I was 13 years old
in a Pony League game.</i>

43:04.263 --> 43:06.663
<i>I was nervous and scared
and I struck out.</i>

43:06.733 --> 43:08.894
<i>I remembered my coach
telling me it didn't matter.</i>

43:08.968 --> 43:11.402
<i>I'd played hard,
I'd given it my all...</i>

43:11.471 --> 43:13.939
<i>all the things I just
talked to this team about.</i>

43:14.007 --> 43:16.498
<i>Well, I was still nervous
and scared...</i>

43:16.576 --> 43:19.636
<i>and I knew this time,
it did matter.</i>

43:32.792 --> 43:34.851
<i>I also knew that I could score.</i>

43:34.927 --> 43:38.363
<i>My legs never felt faster,
my heart never more sure.</i>

43:46.039 --> 43:47.768
<i>I knew I'd make it.</i>

43:49.042 --> 43:50.407
Magnum, no!

43:50.977 --> 43:52.911
Stop!

44:02.321 --> 44:03.720
You're out!

44:07.593 --> 44:09.618
Oh, my God.

44:20.440 --> 44:23.307
By nightfall, I'll be gone.

44:25.812 --> 44:29.304
You'll no longer have Jonathan
Quayle Higgins to kick around.

44:31.284 --> 44:33.411
It's time I moved on anyway.

44:34.220 --> 44:37.212
I've become rather sedentary
on these islands.

44:42.261 --> 44:44.593
Perhaps I'll go to Malaysia...

44:46.599 --> 44:47.827
or Bombay.

44:49.302 --> 44:52.567
Okay, Higgins,
I'm sorry. Really.

44:53.639 --> 44:56.472
I guess I should have held up.
I just...

44:56.609 --> 44:58.634
I thought I could make it.

45:00.780 --> 45:03.271
I mean, yeah, somebody else
might have knocked me in.

45:03.349 --> 45:05.317
But the percentage-
Shut up, Magnum.

45:05.384 --> 45:08.785
Save the postmortems for
your equally inept teammates.

45:08.888 --> 45:11.288
They're not inept.
We tried.

45:13.359 --> 45:16.760
You know,
sometimes things in life...

45:16.829 --> 45:20.458
just don't turn out the way
we think they should, Higgins.

45:21.300 --> 45:24.565
Sometimes you have to take
the bad times...

45:24.637 --> 45:27.071
in order to appreciate
the good ones.

45:27.173 --> 45:29.767
But I'll tell you something,
Higgins.

45:29.909 --> 45:33.106
I'm gonna walk out of here
with my head held high.

45:33.846 --> 45:36.041
I'm proud of the job
that I've done...

45:36.115 --> 45:38.174
and I'm proud of my teammates.

45:38.251 --> 45:40.082
And you wanna know
something else?

45:40.153 --> 45:41.245
What?

45:45.591 --> 45:47.388
I'm proud of you, too.

45:48.828 --> 45:50.523
And you wanna know why?

45:50.696 --> 45:51.856
Why?

45:52.198 --> 45:56.635
Because we went through this whole
unpleasant experience with pride...

45:59.605 --> 46:02.836
honesty and above all, with...

46:03.543 --> 46:05.670
Courage. Thank you, Mickey.

46:09.515 --> 46:12.814
Hey, Magnum, why don't you
turn up the Queen of Hearts?

46:14.320 --> 46:16.515
What Queen of Hearts, Mickey?

46:16.889 --> 46:19.221
There's no Queen of Hearts
showing.

46:19.292 --> 46:20.691
This one.

46:28.768 --> 46:30.531
It's a marked deck.

46:34.373 --> 46:36.466
Is this the one
he used with Robin?

46:36.542 --> 46:38.533
All his decks are marked.

46:42.748 --> 46:44.215
Thank you, Mickey.

46:44.283 --> 46:45.614
Thank you.

46:48.588 --> 46:50.818
I think it's time to go,
don't you?

46:52.024 --> 46:53.924
Would you like to join us?

47:03.536 --> 47:06.266
Easy now. Easy.
Hey, careful.

47:06.339 --> 47:08.330
That lady cost me
more than my last wife.

47:08.407 --> 47:09.806
Put it back.

47:10.710 --> 47:12.371
What?
Put it back.

47:12.712 --> 47:15.704
And you and your Blasters
and your Buzzettes...

47:15.781 --> 47:17.806
or whatever you call them,
and get out of here.

47:17.883 --> 47:19.942
Hey, guy, let's not get
carried away here.

47:20.019 --> 47:22.385
A game is a game, a bet's a bet.

47:22.488 --> 47:25.013
Tell that to Robin.
You cheated him.

47:26.425 --> 47:30.054
All your cards are marked. The
bet was bogus in the first place.

47:31.197 --> 47:32.425
Sue me.

47:32.498 --> 47:34.830
I'll do better than that, Buzz.

47:36.235 --> 47:37.998
I'll write about it.

47:39.138 --> 47:40.571
Aloha, Buzz.

47:41.741 --> 47:43.208
Who told you?

47:43.909 --> 47:45.399
Aloha, Uncle.
