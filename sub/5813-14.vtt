00:03.253 --> 00:04.425
Let us introduce you
to the Men of Letters.

00:04.671 --> 00:07.265
A rabid group of
sanctimonious do-gooders.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.509
Secret society.

00:08.675 --> 00:12.100
The last true beacon
of light in a world gone topsy-turvy.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.223
European team.
They were active during World War ll.

00:14.431 --> 00:15.603
Inducted in 1939,

00:15.849 --> 00:17.442
pan' of a small delegation
that was sent to Europe.

00:17.601 --> 00:18.602
We're legacies.

00:18.769 --> 00:20.289
Time travel. That's a reasonable plan?

00:20.395 --> 00:22.944
What, angels got their hands
on some Deloreans? How did I get here?

00:23.106 --> 00:24.733
You tapped the power
of your soul to get here?

00:24.900 --> 00:26.072
Freaking time travel, man.

00:26.276 --> 00:27.448
The Thule Society, right. They were Nazis.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.695
Nazi necromancers.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.502
Dark magic, mostly with dead people.

00:30.697 --> 00:33.246
You can kill me,
but you will never kill all the Thule.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.373
Nazi bastards.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.917
- Lucifer?
- Bloody hell.

00:40.874 --> 00:41.921
Let's chat.

00:42.084 --> 00:45.133
We want to kill The Darkness,
we need to kill The Darkness.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.390
I've had two shots at Amara.
And I don't think I can.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.263
I got it, Dean.

01:22.833 --> 01:24.506
The bed is cold.

01:27.671 --> 01:29.264
What is that, mon amour?

01:34.011 --> 01:35.354
This is why I've come here.

01:37.139 --> 01:39.983
And I thought you occupied my country
to meet me.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.184
Mmm-hmm.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.858
You were a bonus, Delphine.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.487
A treasure. Ma petite collaboratrice.

01:48.650 --> 01:49.947
But this,

01:51.194 --> 01:53.314
this is what
my country has been waiting for.

01:53.488 --> 01:54.535
Can I see it?

01:55.449 --> 01:58.202
- Naughty Delphine.
- Peter.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.670
One little peek.

02:47.584 --> 02:51.054
I have lived a hard life,
but these months?

02:51.254 --> 02:54.098
Pretending to love a Nazi cochon like you
has been the worst.

02:54.925 --> 02:56.051
But this moment,

02:57.552 --> 03:00.180
watching you die? It is the best.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.243
The Men of Letters send their regards.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.254
We're out.

03:30.293 --> 03:31.840
There was a half a bag yesterday.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.134
I killed it.

03:33.588 --> 03:37.764
Hey, did you know the Nazis had
a special branch devoted to archeology?

03:38.301 --> 03:41.350
Little early for Nazi trivia,
especially without caffeine.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.690
It's called the "Ahnenerbe."

03:43.932 --> 03:45.309
There were sites all over Germany,

03:45.517 --> 03:47.397
and then as the Nazis
increased their territory,

03:47.436 --> 03:50.485
they started popping up
in Poland, Finland, North Africa.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.009
Yeah, how is this more important
than our coffee situation?

03:53.150 --> 03:55.824
'Cause I found something.
I mean, we need something.

03:56.027 --> 03:59.031
A magic, a weapon strong enough
to give us a shot against Amara.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.792
So, I've been looking outside
the lore in history

04:01.992 --> 04:04.666
and I found this, the Vichy Memorandums.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.794
They were Nazi communications
that puzzle historians to this day.

04:07.998 --> 04:12.504
And they speak of a super weapon
obtained by the Ahnenerbe,

04:12.711 --> 04:14.311
said to be strong enough to win the war.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.130
Yeah? What was it?

04:16.839 --> 04:21.641
Well, these memos refer to it as
"The Hand of God."

04:21.845 --> 04:23.925
That was sort of a catch-all term
for several objects

04:24.014 --> 04:26.358
he touched on Earth in Biblical times.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.815
But they're believed to contain
traces of his power.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.361
The Nazis believed a lot of things.

04:33.523 --> 04:36.367
Dean, Lucifer's caged, God's MIA.

04:36.526 --> 04:39.496
The only beings strong enough
to battle Amara are gone.

04:40.322 --> 04:41.995
If we're gonna fight her,
what better way to arm up

04:42.199 --> 04:44.577
than with an actual dose of his power?

04:45.702 --> 04:49.752
Okay, so, you said the Nazis
got their hands on one of these

04:49.998 --> 04:50.999
- hands.
- Right.

04:51.166 --> 04:54.420
If it was so powerful, it could
win them the war, why didn't it?

04:54.836 --> 04:58.010
Because they lost it.
En route to Berlin, it was stolen.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.015
The Nazis searched high and low
for the thief,

05:00.175 --> 05:02.018
but they never found their prime suspect.

05:02.260 --> 05:06.686
Here, Delphine Seydoux.
French mistress to a high-ranking Nazi.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.604
Thought to be a French traitor

05:08.850 --> 05:11.399
until she killed her German lover
and made off with the weapon.

05:12.187 --> 05:13.439
Allied spy? French Resistance?

05:13.688 --> 05:14.888
That's what the Nazis thought,

05:15.273 --> 05:18.072
but their investigation led them
to a different conclusion.

05:18.235 --> 05:20.203
That she was une Femme de Lettres.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.207
A Woman of Letters.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.642
Uh, sir? Would you like to hear
the latest soul numbers?

05:42.884 --> 05:44.932
No, because I don't care.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.770
How about an update on Amara?

05:52.978 --> 05:54.776
Well, the update is...

05:55.230 --> 05:57.107
Well, that there is no update.
We still haven't found her.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.238
Sir, if I may?

06:00.318 --> 06:03.413
Since you've claimed the throne,
we could use some direction.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.079
Any direction.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.126
We could deploy a force.

06:08.285 --> 06:11.164
Real boots on the ground,
shake the trees to find her

06:11.413 --> 06:14.963
with you leading the charge, of course.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.676
We've had a coward and a fool
at the helm for too long.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.598
Perhaps it's time to...

06:25.468 --> 06:27.095
Doggie wants to speak.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.278
How dare you.

06:37.480 --> 06:38.777
The impudence.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.447
The lack of humility.

06:41.651 --> 06:44.120
It's no way to talk to your master.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.535
Lucifer.

06:47.991 --> 06:49.368
That's a good doggie.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.959
Who knew Men of Letters
had European chapters?

06:54.164 --> 06:57.168
Maybe it wasn't an entire chapter,
just some assets, you know.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.377
Yeah, and letting women
join way back in the '40s?

06:59.628 --> 07:02.347
I just never got the impression
they were so big on gender equality.

07:02.505 --> 07:03.665
It's right there in the name.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.517
It was World War ll.
An all-hands-on-deck situation.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.141
Yeah, Rosie the Riveter. Cool.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.316
Here we go. This report
was written by Clifford Henshaw.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.519
A Bunker-based Man of Letters,
back in 1943.

07:15.685 --> 07:16.982
It's the right era.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.027
But it's in French.

07:26.529 --> 07:27.655
- Well?
- Hey.

07:28.657 --> 07:30.705
So, it's definitely about Delphine.

07:30.909 --> 07:35.085
Her name's at the top of every page.
Check this out. Transcriptions.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.004
From transatlantic cables
between Clifford and Delphine.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.209
What do they say?

07:39.376 --> 07:41.879
Give me a second.
Web translation's buggy.

07:43.505 --> 07:46.054
Seriously? Dude, it's, like, noon.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.887
Uh, well, you drank all the coffee,
so what am I supposed to drink, water?

07:52.555 --> 07:53.556
Look at this.

07:53.723 --> 07:54.883
They were making arrangements

07:55.058 --> 07:57.481
to get the artifact out of Europe,
to keep it safe.

07:58.603 --> 08:00.731
Henshaw pulled some strings
with a Man of Letters in the OSS

08:00.939 --> 08:02.907
to requisition an active US submarine

08:03.108 --> 08:06.408
to transport Delphine and the weapon
back to the States.

08:06.820 --> 08:07.821
Back to here.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.160
- Wait, the Bunker?
- Yeah.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.999
It's been here the whole time.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.288
Uh...

08:17.580 --> 08:19.799
No. Never arrived.

08:20.917 --> 08:22.919
"The USS Bluefin came under German attack

08:23.128 --> 08:25.347
"midway through
its trip across the Atlantic.

08:25.588 --> 08:28.512
"The sub was sunk,
and the ship and its contents

08:28.758 --> 08:30.852
"haven't been recovered to this day."

08:31.094 --> 08:32.767
Great, it's lost.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.688
Or is it?

08:36.599 --> 08:38.145
Yeah, I'd say so.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.477
Tides took the wreckage,

08:39.686 --> 08:42.280
submersibles have been
trying to locate it for years.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.029
If James Cameron
and his Avatar billions can't find it...

08:45.275 --> 08:49.121
Yeah, but we have something
that James Cameron doesn't have.

09:06.629 --> 09:07.721
That's all of it?

09:07.964 --> 09:11.639
Yes, sir. The requested weaponry
from your crypts.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.638
Does it please you?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.148
Spare me.

09:28.485 --> 09:29.828
How are your wounds, Doggie?

09:31.654 --> 09:36.034
They are no less than I deserve.

09:37.994 --> 09:38.995
Oh.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.257
You're scared of your master.
That's a good doggie.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.381
Ah!

09:45.543 --> 09:49.514
But it's an act. I broke you, but...

09:51.716 --> 09:56.392
Yep, I can still smell it. You've got that
delectable little whiff of defiance.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.598
You're just playing, huh?

09:58.848 --> 10:02.944
Waiting for your moment
to retake the throne? Am I right?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.401
Yes, sir.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.860
Well, then, tell me,

10:10.360 --> 10:13.910
once and future King of Hell,

10:15.365 --> 10:18.915
you've been watching my rule,
what treasonous thoughts do you have

10:19.202 --> 10:21.045
brewing in that little head of yours, huh?

10:24.707 --> 10:25.924
What are you really thinking?

10:26.543 --> 10:27.635
Hmm?

10:28.461 --> 10:30.384
- The truth, sir?
- Yeah.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.635
You're not strong enough.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.557
You had your weapons delivered.
You realize they won't be enough.

10:41.099 --> 10:44.148
If you thought you could beat Amara,
you'd be taking the fight to her.

10:44.394 --> 10:45.395
Right now.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.946
You're a clever little doggie.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.909
You're right, at the moment,
I may be a bit under-equipped.

10:55.446 --> 10:58.245
Maybe defeating Amara
was bit more of a team effort

10:58.449 --> 11:00.747
than I led certain people to believe.

11:02.579 --> 11:04.252
All that said,

11:05.790 --> 11:08.589
I'm still your master.
Did I let you out of that kennel too soon?

11:10.587 --> 11:11.588
No.

11:15.675 --> 11:19.600
No barking. It's show time.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.359
Hello, Dean.

11:29.939 --> 11:33.614
There were several God-touched objects,
but never occurred to me

11:33.776 --> 11:37.030
that any had survived the Flood,
let alone the 20th century.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.783
Do you think we can use it against Amara?

11:39.949 --> 11:41.166
It's perfect.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.292
And I can get you back there.

11:45.455 --> 11:49.130
Without wings?
Cass, you can't even teleport.

11:49.626 --> 11:53.176
Time travel is a...
It's a whole different system.

11:53.796 --> 11:54.968
Told ya.

11:55.173 --> 11:58.393
So, uh, these the last coordinates?

11:58.635 --> 12:00.808
That's the Bluefin's last transmission
to shore, yeah.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.563
- All right.
- Wait a second.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.475
Cass, aren't there still risks
with time travel?

12:05.642 --> 12:06.859
I mean, aren't there consequences that...

12:07.060 --> 12:09.483
Sam, this is the ideal scenario.

12:09.646 --> 12:10.693
What?

12:10.855 --> 12:13.529
That sub is a tin can floating in the
middle of the ocean, doomed to go down.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.577
You can't really mess with history
at 20,000 leagues.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.322
We get in, get the weapon,
get out. It's a milk run.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.999
No, that's not a very good plan.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.583
Well, if things get out of hand,
then Cass will just zap me right back.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.839
You?

12:29.415 --> 12:30.507
You're not going.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.462
- I beg your pardon?
- You need to stay here.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.093
- "Stay here?"
- Just in case things go sideways,

12:36.297 --> 12:38.817
somebody needs to be left standing
to take care of The Darkness.

12:39.926 --> 12:43.396
We can't risk us both! And at the moment,
I'm the least valuable player.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.116
You both know that I can't kill Amara,

12:45.223 --> 12:48.568
so, the least I could do is get the thing
that we need so that you can.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.270
So you expect me to sit here
and ride the pine

12:50.478 --> 12:52.038
while you and Cass go play Jules Verne?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.403
Yes. No? Who?

12:54.607 --> 12:55.984
I won't let him out of my sight.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.284
You'll stay by his side the entire time?

13:04.701 --> 13:05.953
I will.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.375
Sam.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.880
Let me do this. Okay? I need to do this.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.009
- Be safe.
- When am I not?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.266
Let's do this, Cass.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.435
Bon voyage.

13:38.568 --> 13:39.694
Cass?

13:56.794 --> 13:57.920
Cass?

14:14.479 --> 14:16.777
See, I enlisted to sink German ships.

14:16.981 --> 14:18.449
You're up.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.743
Let's go, vacation's over.

14:20.943 --> 14:23.571
Now we got zip running patrols
in the bay,

14:23.780 --> 14:26.249
and now captain's got us
goin' in the wrong direction?

14:26.449 --> 14:29.419
To run some mystery mission
for some broad? Tell me that makes sense.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.619
I wouldn't worry
about it. Get some rest.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.631
You know I can't rest.

15:03.569 --> 15:07.699
Cass? Why... Wait a second, where's Dean?

15:08.324 --> 15:11.498
We made the leap. He got on, I didn't.

15:12.578 --> 15:13.625
What?

15:16.999 --> 15:19.297
I couldn't make it past the hull.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.269
"1996?"

15:34.267 --> 15:36.690
Where's Delphine? Where's the broad?

15:36.894 --> 15:38.862
I don't know what you're talking about.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.616
Someone must've warded the ship.

15:42.817 --> 15:46.538
Delphine. It has to be.
She's protecting the weapon, right?

15:48.197 --> 15:50.916
Cass, just go back to their last port
before she boarded.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.085
Leave a message, so Dean knows.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.378
Where?

15:55.663 --> 15:58.166
Where would Dean see it
that the crew wouldn't?

15:59.792 --> 16:03.638
He's as likely to find the warding
as he is any message I'd leave.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.263
Then send me. You got Dean past the hull.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.392
Right. We'll double down
on what screwed us the first time.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.396
You're really bringing
your "A" ideas today.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.190
I can't believe I lost it.

16:20.396 --> 16:24.572
Him. I can't believe I lost Dean.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.868
Well, it's up to him now
to find and clear the warding.

16:29.071 --> 16:30.573
No. We can help.

16:30.781 --> 16:33.910
There's got to be something
in magic or angel lore.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.829
Some way to clear the sigils
from the outside.

16:38.206 --> 16:39.332
Cass.

16:40.583 --> 16:43.086
Don't worry. We'll bring him back.

16:50.885 --> 16:54.014
Look out. Coming through. Coming through.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.393
Sir.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.328
When can I smoke?

17:10.780 --> 17:12.339
When it's your turn, I'll let you know.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.501
Surely, some of you boys
take breaks in the engine room.

17:18.663 --> 17:19.915
Captain wants you stayed put.

17:20.122 --> 17:23.092
Let me guess.
He fears I would distract his men?

17:23.291 --> 17:26.546
Does not want a skirt roaming the decks?
Give me the light.

17:26.963 --> 17:30.058
But ma'am, you're wearing pants.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.981
Rich, ain't it? Frog's sitting pretty
like Queen of Sheba

17:41.185 --> 17:42.825
and getting room service in the wardroom,

17:42.895 --> 17:47.116
and I can't even gripe because...
Have you seen that dame? The gams on her?

17:47.316 --> 17:49.159
Yeah, yeah, she's a hottie.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.452
Yeah, those gams, huh?

18:02.999 --> 18:04.467
Who are you?

18:05.626 --> 18:09.426
Delphine. You might find this
hard to believe, but...

18:13.884 --> 18:18.390
Not a soul on this ship knows my name,
so I repeat, who are you?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.441
- Coming through.
- Hey!

18:21.517 --> 18:25.772
I'm a friend of Clifford Henshaw.
I'm a Man of Letters.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.364
That's him! That's the guy.

18:30.568 --> 18:31.569
Captain.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.330
- Sit down.
- Okay, I'm on it, Pete.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.930
He took my clothes,
and he hog-tied me in the head, this guy.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.156
- What should we do with him, Captain?
- Search him.

18:41.412 --> 18:43.414
All right, all right. Yes.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.920
Petey, this yours?

18:52.089 --> 18:53.432
What the hell is this?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.018
It's a phone.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.223
Right. A phone in your pocket.

19:00.431 --> 19:02.525
Well, next thing this guy's gonna tell us
is he's from space.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.102
Yeah, or the future.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.361
I am.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.233
Captain James Dearborn?

19:13.361 --> 19:16.615
My name is Dean Winchester,
and I am on a mission from the future.

19:16.947 --> 19:19.041
The details of which
I am not at liberty to discuss,

19:19.241 --> 19:20.743
but know this, within the hour,

19:20.951 --> 19:24.205
a German Destroyer will find
and attack this submarine.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.128
And you will go down.

19:39.387 --> 19:42.186
Okay, you said your piece.
Let me tell you what I think.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.482
Captain...

19:43.683 --> 19:45.363
I think you're a soldier that's gone AWOL.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.227
You've hopped a ride home,
and this cock-eyed story

19:48.354 --> 19:52.655
is some loony attempt to keep your cover
as a civvie. That, or you're a spy.

19:54.485 --> 19:57.580
Deciding which?
I'll leave that to the court martial.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.706
I need to speak with this man alone.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.375
Not a chance.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.001
Captain, there are things, things about
this mission that you don't know.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.424
Flash Gordon here will remain under guard
until we reach the shore.

20:08.582 --> 20:09.583
Gladly.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.468
What if we don't reach shore?
What if he's right?

20:11.669 --> 20:15.299
The odds of a German attack,
from a surface ship, this far west?

20:15.506 --> 20:16.758
Hunting down a lone submarine?

20:16.966 --> 20:18.183
Captain?

20:22.054 --> 20:25.183
Sonars picked up a surface ship.
On a steady bearing, closing.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.525
Understood.

20:32.106 --> 20:33.266
Harris, back to your station.

20:34.692 --> 20:37.115
Giraldi, watch our guest.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.366
Yes, sir.

20:39.280 --> 20:40.782
The Germans, they've come for it.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.960
Delphine, the warding on the hull?
The sigil?

20:45.828 --> 20:47.125
That's not like any I've seen.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.689
You're certain of the identification?

20:53.753 --> 20:56.222
Yes, sir. A 36B German Destroyer.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.392
Three thousand yards and closing,
bearing zero-nine-zero.

20:59.592 --> 21:01.139
- Clear the bridge.
- Clear the bridge!

21:01.343 --> 21:05.393
My mentor in the Men of Letters.
He taught me the symbol before he died.

21:05.890 --> 21:08.188
World Series, 1944, go.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.238
You're from the future? Tell me who won?

21:15.733 --> 21:16.780
The Rangers.

21:16.942 --> 21:18.034
The Rangers?

21:18.235 --> 21:20.915
He believed it would keep me
and the artifact safe on our journey...

21:20.946 --> 21:21.947
Who are the Rangers?

21:22.114 --> 21:23.866
...from supernatural interference.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.246
And angelic interference.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.543
Angels? They're not real.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.417
Who are the Rangers?

21:28.621 --> 21:32.671
Look, kid, I don't follow baseball, okay?
Yeah, and angels are real.

21:32.875 --> 21:35.469
In fact, one of them
is my ride off this ship.

21:35.669 --> 21:38.949
Now the warding that you put up to block,
the magic, it must have blocked him, too.

21:39.131 --> 21:40.303
I cleared the one. If there's any more,

21:40.508 --> 21:42.306
we gotta clear those, too.
Otherwise, I'm stuck here.

21:42.510 --> 21:44.478
Okay, then. The next president.

21:44.845 --> 21:48.099
Delphine, you wanted the weapon to be
at a Men of Letters safe house, right?

21:48.599 --> 21:51.022
I'm from the Bunker,
that's how I knew how to find you,

21:51.602 --> 21:53.104
from your communication with Henshaw.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.361
Now, if you clear the way,
I can get it there for you.

21:56.565 --> 22:01.321
And that's why you came?
To protect the object, the weapon?

22:02.279 --> 22:04.077
Are you gonna answer my question?

22:05.115 --> 22:08.961
Eisenhower, okay? No, Truman.
Now would you please shut up?

22:09.161 --> 22:13.166
No. This sub is going down,
but the allies do win.

22:14.917 --> 22:16.134
Look, from Men of Letters
to Men of Letters,

22:16.335 --> 22:17.803
I'm fighting a war in the future.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.797
It's not like your war, it's big.

22:20.089 --> 22:22.387
Biblical, end-is-nigh big.

22:23.217 --> 22:24.685
And I need your weapon to win.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.809
That is why I came.

22:29.974 --> 22:31.100
But we all die?

22:34.144 --> 22:37.648
Me, the girl, the rest of the crew?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.571
I'm just trying to get your story clear.

22:51.620 --> 22:52.667
Yes.

22:57.501 --> 23:01.472
Look, I know that's a lot to ask.
Especially from a complete stranger.

23:01.672 --> 23:02.844
You're not a stranger.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.641
Men of Letters to Men of Letters.

23:09.680 --> 23:11.102
I trust you.

23:13.851 --> 23:14.852
Hatch secured.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.818
Alter course to 2-7-0.
Take us down to 60 feet.

23:18.022 --> 23:19.319
Alter course to 2-7-0!

23:19.523 --> 23:21.571
- Altering course to 2-7-0.
- Open front ports.

23:21.775 --> 23:22.867
Dive, dive, dive!

23:23.068 --> 23:24.240
Dive, dive, sir.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.379
Wait a second.
I think I have something.

23:34.580 --> 23:36.127
The Spell of Gathering.

23:36.332 --> 23:40.553
It's an incantation used to focus
the power of celestial beings, angels,

23:40.753 --> 23:43.973
against all drawn forms of evasion.

23:44.423 --> 23:48.223
The spell was designed to clear
all mystical or occult blockages.

23:48.427 --> 23:49.644
I mean, this is highly theoretical magic.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.847
It's never been used before,
but it sounds like it could work.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.524
You have the ingredients?

23:53.724 --> 23:55.226
Uh...

23:58.062 --> 23:59.314
All but one.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.485
That's why it's never been used before.
It requires the power of an archangel.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.874
Well, Sam, we may as well try.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.752
We don't have time for long shots, Cass.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.547
Even at full power,
you're not strong enough.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.903
That's the Hand of God?

24:43.857 --> 24:44.858
Doesn't look like much.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.868
No, I suppose it doesn't.

24:47.069 --> 24:50.289
It must have been more impressive
in its complete form.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.036
The Ark of the Covenant.

24:53.617 --> 24:57.793
So, full-on Raiders, that's... Okay.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.957
Don't touch it barehanded.

25:00.457 --> 25:02.630
Its power is potent and unstable.

25:03.585 --> 25:06.885
No mortal can survive long
with direct contact.

25:09.383 --> 25:14.310
I'll remove the warding.
I'll be back. Promise.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.899
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Definitely not you.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.145
Okay.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.492
When?

25:28.485 --> 25:29.486
When what?

25:30.779 --> 25:34.579
When do we win? Months, years, decades?

25:35.242 --> 25:38.246
Got a lot of friends and family
on other ships, in other branches.

25:38.454 --> 25:41.003
I wanna know what their chances are.

25:44.793 --> 25:45.965
Years.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.338
1945.

25:53.010 --> 25:54.307
You believe me?

25:58.599 --> 26:00.272
I read a lot of Flash Gordon.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.988
Fifteen-hundred yards.
We are not shaking him.

26:08.192 --> 26:09.193
Battle stations.

26:09.443 --> 26:13.698
Sir, respectfully, our orders
were to go home, not engage.

26:13.906 --> 26:15.874
XO, do not make me repeat myself.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.829
- Battle stations!
- Aye, aye, sir!

26:20.037 --> 26:21.880
General quarters, battle stations.

26:22.372 --> 26:25.842
General quarters,
man your battle stations. All hands...

26:26.043 --> 26:27.590
Okay, let's go, let's go, boys.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.672
Let's go. Get a move on, come on.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.134
Okay, okay.
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.639
Keep it going, keep it going.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.561
- Dispatch, get a move on! Get a move on!
- Come on, come on.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.564
Get to it, get to it, get to it.
Everyone in positions.

26:40.849 --> 26:42.396
Stand by to load two number 8.

26:46.063 --> 26:48.065
- Load aft torpedoes.
- Load aft torpedoes.

26:48.273 --> 26:49.320
Load aft torpedoes.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.322
Harris, open the rear door.

26:55.489 --> 26:57.241
- Opening door.
- Clear.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.201
Easy. Ease it down.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.128
- Door secured.
- Flood the tube.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.759
Flooding.

27:13.924 --> 27:15.676
- Ready to fire.
- Ready to fire.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.004
- Eight hundred yards and closing.
- Torpedoes loaded.

27:18.220 --> 27:19.267
Line us up for a bow shot.

27:19.429 --> 27:20.521
Line up for a bow shot.

27:20.722 --> 27:21.922
Lining up for bow shot.

27:22.891 --> 27:23.938
Locked.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.181
In position, ready to fire.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.917
Captain, I've lost his position.

27:41.118 --> 27:42.711
- What?
- He's gone.

27:43.036 --> 27:46.666
How is it possible to lose
a 3000-ton warship from 800 yards?

27:49.001 --> 27:50.093
Find him!

27:59.720 --> 28:01.438
Thirty yards, sir!
He's right on top of us!

28:01.638 --> 28:02.639
How?

28:02.806 --> 28:05.275
Flood negative! Take us down
to max depth and rig for silent running!

28:05.475 --> 28:06.476
Silent running!

28:16.987 --> 28:17.988
- What's happening?
- Shh.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.844
Leveling out on 300, sir.

28:52.522 --> 28:54.320
- Kill me.
- Wait.

28:56.777 --> 28:57.869
You can't do that.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.088
Kill me.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.716
Splashes. Depth charge.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.718
I don't have to kill you, okay?
I can just cut it. It'll work.

29:20.968 --> 29:24.268
Not with this.
It's spellbound to my blood and my heart.

29:24.888 --> 29:27.687
Its power lives and dies with me.

29:28.558 --> 29:29.605
Do it.

29:49.830 --> 29:50.922
Hold on!

29:58.797 --> 30:00.970
Midshipman down! We need a medic!

30:03.677 --> 30:04.769
Hey.

30:07.597 --> 30:08.644
Cass, what is that?

30:09.808 --> 30:11.435
It's your Spell of Gathering.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.648
Are you nuts? You're not strong enough.
Cass, you could get hurt.

30:16.231 --> 30:17.904
You find a better option?

30:18.942 --> 30:21.821
No, but without a serious boost
to your angel power,

30:22.029 --> 30:23.155
that spell won't even work.

30:23.363 --> 30:24.865
My strength may surprise you.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.207
Wait a second.

30:30.662 --> 30:34.383
I remember Bobby told me when you needed
strength to retrieve us from the past,

30:34.583 --> 30:38.008
you used him to power up.
You touched his soul, right?

30:39.296 --> 30:44.052
That's right. I did that.
But that procedure can be fatal.

30:47.429 --> 30:51.354
Use my soul. That way, maybe you'll have
enough power to wield the spell.

30:51.808 --> 30:52.900
That isn't necessary.

30:53.101 --> 30:57.151
It's worth the risk.
Cass, Dean needs our help.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.029
I trust you.

31:08.742 --> 31:09.834
What?

31:10.744 --> 31:13.918
It's just... I don't need you anymore.

31:14.122 --> 31:16.250
Dean's the one with the link to Amara.

31:16.458 --> 31:18.631
Why have I been trying to spare you?

31:18.835 --> 31:23.011
Maybe it's because you're like the girl

31:23.215 --> 31:25.343
who kept turning me down at the prom.

31:27.260 --> 31:31.060
I will touch your soul.
Just because you asked so nicely,

31:31.264 --> 31:33.562
and I'll use your spell
to blast through the warding

31:33.767 --> 31:37.192
and retrieve Dean and the Hand of God.

31:37.813 --> 31:39.360
And then when Dean comes back

31:39.564 --> 31:43.285
and he finds this place
decorated with your guts,

31:43.485 --> 31:45.829
I will tell him the truth, Sam.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.706
I'll just say, "Dean..."

31:51.660 --> 31:55.506
"Dean, he knew the risks.

31:57.249 --> 31:59.468
"He wouldn't take no for an answer."

32:00.627 --> 32:01.628
Lucifer.

32:02.254 --> 32:03.506
In the flesh.

32:32.033 --> 32:33.626
Hello, Castiel.

32:35.871 --> 32:38.545
Medic! Come on!

32:38.748 --> 32:39.795
Damage report?

32:39.958 --> 32:41.960
Battery room's flooded. Hull's breached.

32:42.586 --> 32:43.678
We're dead in the water.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.973
Ship's locked in position above us.

32:47.174 --> 32:49.222
American submarine.

32:52.012 --> 32:56.313
Captain. The Germans
are sending a message.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.186
American submarine.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.943
Sir, it's not for you.

33:06.568 --> 33:07.785
Watch your head.

33:16.578 --> 33:17.579
Go ahead.

33:21.583 --> 33:23.881
Hello, mein liebchen.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.838
It is not possible. I killed you.

33:27.047 --> 33:29.141
A little advice, Delphine.

33:30.133 --> 33:33.387
If you want a friend of the Thule
to stay dead,

33:34.054 --> 33:35.556
burn the body.

33:37.390 --> 33:38.687
A word for the captain.

33:39.768 --> 33:44.239
You may have noticed you are up against
a warship and a crew possessing,

33:44.439 --> 33:47.989
let us say, extraordinary abilities.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.871
And you have taken damage
that you cannot recover from.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.291
So, I offer you a choice.

33:55.242 --> 33:58.837
Surface now,
relinquish the girl and her cargo,

33:59.037 --> 34:04.385
and I can assure you and your men
the highest of POW treatment.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.846
Or you can protect her,

34:08.838 --> 34:13.217
and we will depth charge you and your boat
right into the seabed

34:13.467 --> 34:16.141
and recover the cargo ourselves.

34:17.429 --> 34:19.853
You have three minutes to surrender.

34:25.813 --> 34:30.445
I don't expect you to understand,
but this cargo, the Germans can't have it.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.038
You need to believe me.

34:33.237 --> 34:35.616
Our orders were to protect you
and your cargo.

34:35.824 --> 34:37.371
We wouldn't even consider a surrender.

34:39.327 --> 34:43.672
You had better reconsider.
Killing me is your only way off this ship.

34:48.295 --> 34:49.295
Maybe not.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.926
Teach me how to use it.
It's the power of God.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.761
Maybe I can use it to save you,
save the sub?

34:57.262 --> 34:58.980
- And your war?
- I wanna help you now.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.181
Two minutes, Captain.

35:00.348 --> 35:02.942
You save this ship,
get us to the surface and then what?

35:03.184 --> 35:04.811
The power of God will consume you,

35:05.020 --> 35:08.149
and you'll have merely brought the weapon
closer to the Nazis' grasp.

35:11.151 --> 35:15.327
We are supposed to die.
Let us do it with a purpose.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.635
How long can you keep the boat steady?

35:18.742 --> 35:20.665
Not long.
And once they resume their attack...

35:20.869 --> 35:22.029
Give me every second you can.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.330
- Delphine, what are you doing?
- One minute.

35:23.538 --> 35:24.664
I'm going to get you home.

35:24.873 --> 35:27.717
And I'm going to get you and your men
your first German ship.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.974
- No, no, no.
- Sam. Sam, it's me.

35:39.554 --> 35:41.397
Cass? Why?

35:41.723 --> 35:46.069
I wanted to be of service to the fight.
And only Lucifer can beat her.

35:46.561 --> 35:50.987
You chose this? You have to fight, Cass.
Eject him, now!

35:51.191 --> 35:55.913
I can't! It's taking all my strength
to keep him from killing you.

35:56.738 --> 35:57.739
And besides, we need him.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.705
No, Cass, we don't.
We'll find another way to stop Amara.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.790
We need him to save Dean.

36:06.706 --> 36:07.707
You can't time travel.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.177
Only Lucifer can.

36:11.461 --> 36:12.633
How fast is your ride back?

36:13.171 --> 36:14.172
- Fast.
- Good.

36:14.339 --> 36:15.431
It's time!

36:39.948 --> 36:41.120
God help us all.

36:59.718 --> 37:00.719
This is torpedo room...

37:00.885 --> 37:03.229
- Isolate that panel!
- We need assistance!

37:07.976 --> 37:09.319
Fire in the control room!

37:12.397 --> 37:16.152
Torpedo room taking water!
We need assistance!

37:21.030 --> 37:22.031
Electrical!

37:26.661 --> 37:29.039
Dean. That's not Cass!

37:32.292 --> 37:33.339
Cat's out.

37:43.511 --> 37:44.603
Mmm.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.189
Feel a burden lifted.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.860
You know, this whole
deep cover thing, just wasn't,

37:50.059 --> 37:52.403
it wasn't terribly well-thought-out.

37:52.937 --> 37:56.066
Donning this, this Cass mask,

37:56.274 --> 38:00.825
this grim face
of angelic constipation, just...

38:01.362 --> 38:03.160
And then, teaming up with you two?

38:03.364 --> 38:06.743
I thought you boys
were insufferable as mortal enemies,

38:06.951 --> 38:09.795
but working with you?

38:10.789 --> 38:12.086
That's the soul crusher.

38:18.713 --> 38:21.842
Why the faces, boys?
You should be cheering.

38:22.050 --> 38:23.347
We have a common enemy.

38:23.551 --> 38:25.599
With this, she will be no problem.

38:27.639 --> 38:31.610
I will have killed you both by then,
but still, come on.

38:36.564 --> 38:37.565
No.

38:39.859 --> 38:40.860
No!

38:49.369 --> 38:50.586
It's kicked.

38:55.416 --> 38:59.592
Well, who'd have thought the Hand of God
turned out to be a one-hitter?

39:39.294 --> 39:40.466
So......

39:41.629 --> 39:42.801
So......

39:44.257 --> 39:45.634
- Cass?
- Yeah.

39:49.971 --> 39:51.689
Now, what do we do?

39:53.766 --> 39:55.109
What else?

39:56.185 --> 39:59.815
We hunt Lucifer.
Trap the bastard and save Cass.

40:02.066 --> 40:05.195
Like I said,
Lucifer may be in control now,

40:05.403 --> 40:08.452
but Cass may not come back willingly.
He chose it.

40:08.656 --> 40:11.500
No. No, not possible.

40:18.625 --> 40:21.504
How'd you get through today?
What did you do?

40:23.922 --> 40:25.174
Nothing.

40:27.467 --> 40:28.889
Sam, they...

40:35.183 --> 40:37.026
I was just a witness.

40:41.189 --> 40:43.066
Do you wanna talk about it?

40:48.029 --> 40:50.999
No. No, story for another day.

41:01.876 --> 41:07.224
Hey, the German ship that sank
the Bluefin, what happened to it?

41:08.508 --> 41:10.010
It went down.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.346
Unlike the sub, its wreckage was found.

41:13.554 --> 41:16.979
With a giant hole
that ripped through the entire thing.

41:17.183 --> 41:21.154
I mean, something must have hit the
fuel tanks and exploded, but it burned.

41:21.354 --> 41:22.480
Sank.

42:26.753 --> 42:27.800
English - SDH
