WEBVTT

00:03.437 --> 00:05.673
Game show marathon
and Chinese food.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.541
What could make
this night any better?

00:07.575 --> 00:10.278
A round of "Boink, Marry, Kill"?

00:10.311 --> 00:12.280
BOTH:
Ooh! (laugh)

00:12.313 --> 00:14.815
Okay, you have to choose
to "Boink, Marry or Kill"

00:14.848 --> 00:16.684
Bob Barker, Pat Sajak
and skinny Drew Carey.

00:16.717 --> 00:19.420
Okay, I'd boink Drew Carey.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.723
Marry Pat Sajak, so I could
boink him all the time.

00:22.756 --> 00:24.358
And I don't want
to kill anybody,

00:24.392 --> 00:25.659
so I'd just break
Bob Barker's hip

00:25.693 --> 00:28.262
and let God do the rest.

00:28.296 --> 00:29.563
What about you, Nathan?

00:32.333 --> 00:34.602
I-I'm not doing this.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.370
It's just a game, honey.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.339
No, no. I mean I'm not coming
over here for dinner anymore.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.344
Oh, let's see
what's behind door number one.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.247
It's an exit!

00:46.280 --> 00:47.315
I win!

01:11.405 --> 01:12.673
Dad, don't worry.

01:12.706 --> 01:14.542
We'll figure out why
your bank balance is off.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.545
What is this $300 monthly charge
for Chuck E. Cheese's?

01:17.578 --> 01:19.780
Oh. No, no.
That was my idea.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.115
He does skee ball
and Whac-A-Mole.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.116
It's really his
only cardio.

01:22.150 --> 01:23.717
Oh, I see.

01:23.751 --> 01:26.587
Plus the calories I burn running
to the parking lot from security

01:26.620 --> 01:28.789
when they realize
I'm not there with a kid.

01:30.824 --> 01:32.426
Tom, you're not
gonna believe this.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.827
You know that banquet hall
we booked in advance

01:33.861 --> 01:36.330
to celebrate our big wedding
anniversary this year?

01:36.364 --> 01:38.166
I completely forgot about that.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.168
I've been so busy celebrating
our breakup.

01:40.201 --> 01:40.834
I hear that!

01:40.868 --> 01:42.336
(both laugh)

01:42.370 --> 01:44.672
I'd forgotten, too,
until they called to confirm.

01:44.705 --> 01:47.375
And you won't believe what
they're charging us to cancel.

01:47.408 --> 01:50.144
"$900. McGee's
Banquet Hall."

01:50.178 --> 01:51.545
It's right here
on your account.

01:51.579 --> 01:55.183
Just before an... $86
charge for frozen yogurt?

01:55.216 --> 01:58.352
I forgot to put the handle
back up on the self-serve.

01:59.720 --> 02:00.854
$86?

02:00.888 --> 02:03.824
Tom, you have to stop being
an idiot with our savings.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.726
Half that money
you're wasting is mine!

02:05.759 --> 02:07.761
I waste money?
I paid half for you and Kip

02:07.795 --> 02:10.164
to go see Olivia Newton John
in concert.

02:10.198 --> 02:11.499
Wasn't just Olivia.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.867
It was Olivia, Cher and Madonna.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.337
All done by
one amazing young man.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.608
Okay, can we agree it's time
you two split up your finances

02:20.641 --> 02:21.742
and officially file for divorce?

02:21.775 --> 02:23.377
Or not!

02:23.411 --> 02:24.878
Maybe, uh...

02:24.912 --> 02:26.747
Maybe things are fine
the way they are.

02:26.780 --> 02:28.616
Wait a second, I thought
you guys already were divorced.

02:28.649 --> 02:29.883
Not officially.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.819
And maybe things are
fine the way they are.

02:31.852 --> 02:34.255
No, Debbie's right.

02:34.288 --> 02:35.689
We've avoided the
paperwork long enough.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.924
It's time to
make it official.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.327
Or maybe things are
fine the way they are!

02:40.994 --> 02:42.796
Tom, what do you say
we get together

02:42.830 --> 02:43.931
and hash out
all the details?

02:43.964 --> 02:45.466
Is next Wednesday good?

02:45.499 --> 02:46.600
Sounds cool to me.

02:46.634 --> 02:47.835
Ah, then we're all set.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.102
I got to go.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.872
I have a ballroom dance class,
and there are only three men.

02:51.905 --> 02:55.276
If I don't get there early,
I'll end up with Esther again.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.211
And she's on a scooter.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.814
Nice, Debbie.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.284
This past year has been the best
this family has ever functioned.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.485
You ever heard of the saying,

03:04.518 --> 03:05.786
"If it ain't broke,
don't fix it"?

03:05.819 --> 03:07.255
No.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.590
Yes, you have!

03:09.623 --> 03:10.424
Everybody...

03:10.458 --> 03:12.360
Right, Adam?
No, I never heard of it.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.361
(stutters angrily)

03:13.394 --> 03:14.595
God.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.897
Great, now I got to go cancel
my plans for Wednesday night

03:16.930 --> 03:18.232
and make sure this whole thing
doesn't turn

03:18.266 --> 03:19.166
into a giant train wreck.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.869
Train wreck? Why would
they be on trains?

03:21.902 --> 03:24.238
It's a saying!

03:24.272 --> 03:25.873
I never heard of it.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.040
Yeah, and, uh, according
to the Internet,

03:27.074 --> 03:29.443
there's nothing about "If it
ain't broke, don't fix it."

03:31.745 --> 03:33.381
Are you guys...?

03:33.414 --> 03:35.716
Is this whole place...?

03:35.749 --> 03:36.917
Am I the only one...?

03:40.053 --> 03:41.955
That was pretty fun.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.724
Yeah, we got to screw with him
more often.

03:47.828 --> 03:50.864
Okay, we're all set for
my mom and dad to come over

03:50.898 --> 03:52.366
and sign their divorce papers.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.967
Snacks are out,
you're getting the drinks,

03:54.001 --> 03:57.571
and I have 911 on speed dial.

03:57.605 --> 03:58.639
Hey, don't worry, Nate.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.640
It's impossible
for people to fight

03:59.673 --> 04:01.575
when they got an umbrella drink
in their hand.

04:01.609 --> 04:02.643
Hey, you never saw Mrs. Howell

04:02.676 --> 04:03.877
throw a punch
at Gilligan did you?

04:05.913 --> 04:07.481
DEBBIE:
Okay, we're here.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.284
I'll tell you one thing,
if your mother thinks

04:10.318 --> 04:11.985
she's getting half of
my binoculars, she's crazy.

04:12.019 --> 04:14.755
If I showed up to my bird club
with one nocular,

04:14.788 --> 04:18.025
they'd laugh me
out of the forest.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.527
Yeah. Yeah, we'll
figure it out, Dad.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.695
Tom, would you like
a crème de menthe?

04:21.729 --> 04:23.531
Mmm, crème de menthe,
I'd love some.

04:23.564 --> 04:25.265
I forgot to brush
my teeth this morning.

04:28.536 --> 04:32.005
Nathan, I hope it's okay, but
Kip insisted on coming along.

04:32.039 --> 04:36.577
I will be acting as
your mother's attorney today.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.413
I have an extensive
legal background.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.682
I was a court stenographer

04:41.715 --> 04:44.752
for 16... days.

04:46.019 --> 04:50.458
Apparently, asking them to
talk slower is "unprofessional."

04:52.025 --> 04:53.894
Well, no need, Kip.

04:53.927 --> 04:56.330
While I'm impressed that, uh,

04:56.364 --> 04:59.900
your briefcase doubles
as a backgammon board,

04:59.933 --> 05:02.470
I had some papers drawn up
by a real lawyer.

05:02.503 --> 05:05.005
And you'll see that
everything has been divided

05:05.038 --> 05:06.707
fair and square, right, Ray?

05:06.740 --> 05:10.010
Oh, yeah. Uh, Carol, can
I interest you in a cocktail?

05:10.043 --> 05:13.013
Oh, mahalo.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.948
Well, it all sounds
good to me.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.950
Tom, I'm ready
to sign if you are.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.452
Ready? I can't wait.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.654
I've been dreaming of this
since the honeymoon.

05:20.688 --> 05:23.023
Wait, what is this?
"No Fault Divorce"?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.025
This isn't a
"No Fault Divorce."

05:25.058 --> 05:26.827
We need one that says
"His Fault Divorce."

05:27.995 --> 05:28.962
"His Fault"?

05:28.996 --> 05:30.431
We both want this divorce.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.099
True, but you're the one
who ended the marriage

05:32.132 --> 05:33.401
by walking out on me.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.635
So, technically,
it is your fault.

05:34.668 --> 05:37.137
What?! The only reason
I walked out is

05:37.170 --> 05:39.473
'cause you'd constantly
criticize everything I did!

05:39.507 --> 05:42.376
I mean, how does
someone blink wrong?!

05:42.410 --> 05:44.512
Your blinks are too long!

05:45.479 --> 05:47.915
They're like tiny naps!

05:47.948 --> 05:50.117
Driving in the car with you
is terrifying.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.054
Okay. Guys, guys.
You both want this divorce,

05:54.087 --> 05:55.556
so who cares
whose fault it was?

05:55.589 --> 05:56.490
I do!

05:56.524 --> 05:58.091
When historians look back
on the record,

05:58.125 --> 05:59.527
I want it to reflect the truth.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.729
What historians? This is nuts!

06:01.762 --> 06:04.131
I will never sign
a "No Fault Divorce."
Me neither!

06:04.164 --> 06:05.165
Well, I guess
we're still married then.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.167
Great! Let's stay married!

06:07.200 --> 06:08.869
Guess I'll be moving back into
the house with you then!

06:08.902 --> 06:09.903
Fantastic!

06:09.937 --> 06:10.904
Wait, my house.

06:10.938 --> 06:11.905
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.007
See you at home, honey!

06:14.041 --> 06:15.142
Can't wait, sweetie!

06:15.175 --> 06:17.445
I'll pack my stuff!

06:19.480 --> 06:22.750
What just happened?

06:22.783 --> 06:26.720
I guess Mrs. Howell wants
to get off the island.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.589
Okay. Well, I better go
get Adam and Mikayla.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.757
We're gonna sleep here tonight.

06:29.790 --> 06:30.891
Wait, what?

06:30.924 --> 06:32.025
Yeah, you remember how intense

06:32.059 --> 06:33.160
their fighting used to be.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.094
They used to scream so loud,

06:34.127 --> 06:37.631
we lost two pet hamsters
to heart attacks.

06:37.665 --> 06:40.768
I don't want to bury my daughter
in a shoe box in the backyard.

06:42.870 --> 06:46.474
Well, my work here is done.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.809
If anybody would like
to play backgammon with me,

06:48.842 --> 06:50.844
I'll be across the hall.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.189
Uh...

07:02.222 --> 07:03.991
Oh, my God.

07:04.024 --> 07:07.060
They've been alone 24 hours,
and they've destroyed my house.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.962
It looks like
there was a struggle.

07:08.996 --> 07:12.733
You don't think your father did
something to my Carol, do you?

07:12.766 --> 07:14.067
No, please.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.636
If anything,
I'm worried about Dad.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.806
Mom gets road rage while
she's still in the driveway.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.541
You might be right.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.676
(sniffs loudly)

07:22.710 --> 07:24.678
This is Tom's smelly loafer.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.714
It looks like
she overpowered Tom

07:26.747 --> 07:28.649
and then dragged
his lifeless body upstairs.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.752
Oh, no.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.253
I might be
partially responsible.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.556
I-I was the one who taught her
"Boink, Marry, Kill."

07:41.161 --> 07:43.731
(all screaming)

07:46.867 --> 07:48.836
How did this happen?

07:48.869 --> 07:51.739
Well, your mother has a bad
back, so mostly missionary...

07:51.772 --> 07:53.607
No, no, n-n-no! God!

07:53.641 --> 07:54.808
What?

07:54.842 --> 07:56.744
This is so much worse
than when we thought

07:56.777 --> 07:58.979
you'd killed each other.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.181
We're as surprised
as you are.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.250
Neither of us
saw this coming.

08:03.283 --> 08:07.220
I came over here hotter than
an Orlando parking lot in July,

08:07.254 --> 08:10.724
ready to pick up our marriage
where we left off.

08:10.758 --> 08:12.159
Great!

08:12.192 --> 08:14.261
I'm here 30 seconds,
and you've already dumped out

08:14.294 --> 08:15.663
your dirty laundry for me!

08:15.696 --> 08:17.831
Hey, those are clean!

08:17.865 --> 08:19.166
Debbie taught me
how to do laundry!

08:19.199 --> 08:21.669
She also taught me
how to mend my clothes.

08:21.702 --> 08:23.837
So, zip it
before I sew it shut.

08:23.871 --> 08:26.540
CAROL: But your father
wasn't the same person

08:26.574 --> 08:28.742
I was married to a year ago.

08:28.776 --> 08:31.645
TOM: Truth was we'd both
gone through some changes.

08:31.679 --> 08:32.980
I'm out of blood
pressure medicine,

08:33.013 --> 08:34.281
and since I'm gonna
be around you,

08:34.314 --> 08:36.016
I'm gonna need
all I can get!

08:36.049 --> 08:39.119
Great! My favorite hummingbird
was just gorging on nectar.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.921
But I guess Kevin
will have to wait

08:40.954 --> 08:42.790
so I can drive you to the store!

08:42.823 --> 08:45.593
I have a driver's license now;
I can take myself!

08:45.626 --> 08:47.795
Enjoy your birdies, you loon!

08:50.030 --> 08:51.999
TOM: We were trying
our best to fight,

08:52.032 --> 08:55.769
but all of our old arguments
weren't working anymore.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.671
CAROL: Before we knew it,
we were running out

08:57.705 --> 08:58.806
of stuff to be mad about.

08:58.839 --> 09:00.708
I bought you three kinds of soup

09:00.741 --> 09:02.776
'cause I know
how much you love soup!

09:02.810 --> 09:04.812
I do love soup.
But I already cooked dinner.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.647
I made an extra plate
if you want it!

09:06.680 --> 09:07.815
Well, thank you!

09:07.848 --> 09:08.916
I am kind of hungry!

09:08.949 --> 09:10.017
I thought you might be!

09:10.050 --> 09:11.819
And I put some
fresh Parmesan on it

09:11.852 --> 09:13.086
because I know you like that!

09:13.120 --> 09:14.221
How thoughtful!

09:14.254 --> 09:15.856
I like cheese!

09:18.325 --> 09:20.761
CAROL: And then we realized
that changing who we were

09:20.794 --> 09:23.130
wasn't the only thing
we had in common.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.231
Wait a second.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.766
Are you watching
Game of Thrones?

09:25.799 --> 09:27.801
You can't like Game of Thrones.

09:27.835 --> 09:28.869
Why not?

09:28.902 --> 09:30.938
Because I like Game of Thrones.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.808
And we haven't agreed on
a TV show since the O.J. trial.

09:34.842 --> 09:37.010
I don't know why they didn't
bring that show back

09:37.044 --> 09:38.912
for a second season.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.280
(both laughing)

09:42.015 --> 09:45.719
And before you knew it, we were
upstairs, adding a new memory

09:45.753 --> 09:46.954
to his memory
foam mattress.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.989
Okay.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.257
All right. So what?

09:50.290 --> 09:51.792
S-So you had one last hurrah.

09:51.825 --> 09:54.628
No, more like
three-and-a-half hurrahs.

09:54.662 --> 09:55.829
Your father got
a charley horse.

09:55.863 --> 09:58.198
Okay. Well...

09:58.231 --> 10:00.233
the only hurrah that
matters is the last one,

10:00.267 --> 10:03.303
so here are your
divorce papers to sign.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.339
Actually, we were just
talking about this, and, um...

10:06.373 --> 10:09.242
your father and I are
gonna give this another go.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.287
Oh, my God.
You've broken your children.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.993
We're gonna stay married.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.828
No, no, no, no.
This is a terrible idea.

10:27.861 --> 10:28.862
Why are you
doing this?

10:28.896 --> 10:30.163
Everything was perfect.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.431
You two were barely speaking.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.667
All was right with the world,
and she ruined it!

10:33.701 --> 10:34.868
Hey, hey.

10:34.902 --> 10:37.705
I-I had no idea this would
turn into such a train wreck.

10:37.738 --> 10:39.339
Aha! I knew you knew
that expression!

10:39.372 --> 10:41.174
You know, Carol,
aside from the fact

10:41.208 --> 10:42.843
that you're making the biggest
mistake of your life,

10:42.876 --> 10:44.745
where does this leave me?

10:44.778 --> 10:47.715
Every frozen food
we bought was for two!

10:48.916 --> 10:51.251
And do you know
how stupid I'm gonna look

10:51.284 --> 10:52.853
alone on our tandem bike?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.823
This just isn't meant to be.

10:55.856 --> 10:59.226
Okay? Just because something is
sweet in the moment doesn't mean

10:59.259 --> 11:02.262
that you can change
the laws of nature.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.998
Like... like when you see
a gorilla playing with a kitten.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.266
You think, "Aw, how sweet."

11:06.299 --> 11:10.003
But pretty soon, that kitten is
gonna get his head twisted off.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.973
In the time we were apart, your
mother and I fixed the things

11:13.006 --> 11:14.875
we hated about each other.

11:14.908 --> 11:17.010
And rediscovered the
reasons we fell in love.

11:17.044 --> 11:18.779
And on a slightly
related topic,

11:18.812 --> 11:20.047
Debbie, you're out
of baby oil.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.953
Guys, you are a terrible
combination of two great things.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.254
You know, you're like
texting and driving.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.222
NATHAN: If you want to
see a compatible couple,

11:29.256 --> 11:31.224
look at Debbie and Adam.
Aw, Nathan.

11:31.258 --> 11:36.029
There's no denying that there's
only one lid for that Crock-Pot.

11:36.063 --> 11:39.299
Even Ray and I are
more compatible than you two.

11:39.332 --> 11:40.433
We thought you'd be happy.

11:40.467 --> 11:43.036
Isn't this what you all have
been rooting for all along?

11:43.070 --> 11:44.738
BOTH:
No!

11:44.772 --> 11:47.474
I mean, we just bought
a Snuggie with four arms.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.076
What am I gonna do,
put my legs through it?

11:50.778 --> 11:53.981
Clearly, we aren't making
any headway here.

11:54.014 --> 11:57.050
But I do know one way
to get through to Carol Miller,

11:57.084 --> 11:59.853
and that's by speaking
a language she understands.

11:59.887 --> 12:01.989
The Wrongly-Wed Game!

12:02.022 --> 12:03.957
(game show music playing)

12:06.526 --> 12:09.029
And here's your host,
Kip Finkle.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.299
Welcome to The Wrongly-Wed Game,

12:12.332 --> 12:15.769
where couples put their lack
of compatibility to the test.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.037
Let's welcome our couples.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.106
Couple number one
has been married nine years

12:19.139 --> 12:20.373
and have a daughter
that's eight-and-a-half--

12:20.407 --> 12:21.241
you do the math.

12:21.274 --> 12:24.144
Ladies and gentlemen,
Debbie and Alan.

12:24.177 --> 12:25.879
Adam.
That's right.

12:25.913 --> 12:30.050
Okay, couple number two
are long-time work spouses

12:30.083 --> 12:32.019
who just celebrated
the ten-year anniversary

12:32.052 --> 12:34.955
of being each other's emergency
contacts, Nathan and Ray.

12:34.988 --> 12:35.956
(imitates explosion)

12:35.989 --> 12:37.024
And finally,

12:37.057 --> 12:39.392
the worst marriage
since Labradors and poodles--

12:39.426 --> 12:42.162
hey, scientists,
stay out of my dogs--

12:42.195 --> 12:43.931
let's welcome
couple number three,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.165
Carol and Tom.

12:45.198 --> 12:46.934
If this is
what it takes to prove

12:46.967 --> 12:48.802
that we're truly meant
to be together,

12:48.836 --> 12:50.537
then let the game begin.

12:50.570 --> 12:54.541
We should be up by a point
because we already scored today.

12:57.044 --> 12:59.913
And keeping score tonight

12:59.947 --> 13:04.084
will be the lovely Mikayla!

13:04.117 --> 13:06.887
Hey, Mikayla,

13:06.920 --> 13:10.057
have you ever seen
Vanna White talk? Okay?

13:11.859 --> 13:13.460
Question number one,

13:13.493 --> 13:15.996
if your spouse could
have one superpower,

13:16.029 --> 13:16.830
what would they choose?

13:16.864 --> 13:18.265
Uh-huh, we just
talked about this.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.266
Invisibility.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.300
KIP:
Ah.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.035
(bell dings)

13:22.069 --> 13:23.904
I would hug people
at funerals,

13:23.937 --> 13:25.438
and they'd think
it was their loved ones.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.276
Nathan, you're up.
Ray's superpower.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.443
Oh, that's easy.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.079
Uh, perfect memory.

13:32.112 --> 13:35.148
Aw, man, that's better
than what I wrote.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.349
(bell dings)

13:36.383 --> 13:37.417
Oh. (laughs)

13:37.450 --> 13:39.452
I forgot, I did
write that!

13:39.486 --> 13:40.453
(laughs):
Forgot!

13:40.487 --> 13:41.922
Okay, Carol.

13:41.955 --> 13:44.958
This is an easy one for
a history buff like Tom--

13:44.992 --> 13:47.027
time travel.

13:47.060 --> 13:50.130
(buzzer sounds)

13:50.163 --> 13:54.134
I like dogs, I want to know
why they don't like me.

13:55.936 --> 13:58.138
If you and your spouse
could take a dream vacation,

13:58.171 --> 13:59.172
where would it be?

13:59.206 --> 14:00.507
Uh-huh, Nantucket.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.175
(bell dings)

14:02.209 --> 14:03.510
There's a man from there

14:03.543 --> 14:05.245
whose hand I've always
wanted to shake.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.449
Carol.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.884
Tom and I would go

14:10.918 --> 14:13.453
to the same heavenly place
we went for 40 years--

14:13.486 --> 14:15.488
Nags Head, North Carolina.

14:16.523 --> 14:18.291
(buzzer sounds)

14:20.193 --> 14:21.995
Your spouse has just won
a million dollars;

14:22.029 --> 14:23.663
what is the first thing
he would do with the money?

14:23.696 --> 14:25.198
Nathan.

14:25.232 --> 14:26.599
Well...

14:26.633 --> 14:30.103
I know his mom needs a house,
but I'm gonna go with

14:30.137 --> 14:32.239
put a lazy river between
his apartment and work.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.273
(chuckles)

14:33.306 --> 14:34.307
(bell dings)

14:36.043 --> 14:37.177
Carol, you're up.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.912
I believe the first thing
Tom would do

14:38.946 --> 14:40.313
with the money is invest it.
Oh, great.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.615
And, Tom,
how did you get this one wrong?

14:43.650 --> 14:45.318
(buzzer sounds)

14:45.352 --> 14:46.886
I'm out of vitamins.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.157
Time for the bonus round.

14:50.190 --> 14:51.992
It's Sunday night, you've got
the house to yourselves;

14:52.025 --> 14:53.193
what do you do, Alan?

14:53.226 --> 14:55.195
Still Adam.
Alden.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.196
I can't say it
with Mikayla listening.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.164
Oh, my God,
you're right.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.999
Honey, shut your eyes
and plug your ears.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.435
Read Mikayla's diary.

15:06.639 --> 15:07.640
It's so cute.

15:07.674 --> 15:09.242
You should see the way
she spells "marijuana."

15:10.243 --> 15:11.979
Ray.

15:12.012 --> 15:15.048
Um, I'm gonna go with we
massage each other's shoulders

15:15.082 --> 15:17.050
and swear it
never happened.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.086
(bell dings)

15:24.191 --> 15:26.159
Okay, let's play,
let's play.

15:26.193 --> 15:27.160
Let's play.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.696
Tom and Carol, can you make it
a perfect zero?

15:29.729 --> 15:31.631
Oh, I don't know.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.266
Watch Game of Thrones.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.236
"Watch Game of Thrones!"

15:36.269 --> 15:37.104
(screams)

15:37.137 --> 15:39.306
See! You are wrong!

15:39.339 --> 15:41.308
We are meant to be together!

15:41.341 --> 15:43.143
Oh, you got one question right.

15:43.176 --> 15:44.477
Congratulations.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.179
You tied Debbie's S.A.T. score.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.382
But it was the bonus question--

15:49.416 --> 15:51.318
the most important
question of all.

15:51.351 --> 15:54.121
And look at us, still finding
new things to bond over,

15:54.154 --> 15:55.555
like our love of
Game of Thrones.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.757
That's because as
we've grown up and matured,

15:57.790 --> 15:59.492
we're able to sit there
without fighting

15:59.526 --> 16:01.261
and enjoy
the intricate storytelling

16:01.294 --> 16:03.296
and subtle allegories...

16:03.330 --> 16:04.464
And boobs.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.200
What?

16:07.234 --> 16:09.169
I like the boobs;
that's why I watch.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.238
Are you kidding me?

16:11.271 --> 16:13.006
So, in the middle
of Game of Thrones,

16:13.040 --> 16:14.307
when you turned
to me and said,

16:14.341 --> 16:15.675
"This show is having
a deep effect on me,"

16:15.708 --> 16:20.147
you were just getting worked up
over the boobies?

16:20.180 --> 16:21.714
Baby, no. Of course not.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.316
I also like the butts.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.154
My man.

16:27.187 --> 16:30.123
Well, this makes perfect sense
coming from a guy

16:30.157 --> 16:32.325
who wants to be able
to talk to dogs!

16:32.359 --> 16:35.528
The Andersons' poodle
snarls at me for no reason.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.030
No reason!

16:37.064 --> 16:39.299
This is exactly why we got
all the questions wrong!

16:39.332 --> 16:40.733
Oh, this is my fault?!

16:40.767 --> 16:42.169
Classic Carol!

16:42.202 --> 16:43.736
My answers
can't be wrong.

16:43.770 --> 16:44.771
They're my answers.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.606
You were supposed
to guess them!

16:46.639 --> 16:48.308
Which was easy
when you used to have

16:48.341 --> 16:52.445
the common sense just to think
what I told you to think!

16:52.479 --> 16:54.047
Yeah? Well, now
I think on my own!

16:54.081 --> 16:55.282
And I think I want a divorce!

16:55.315 --> 16:56.416
CAROL:
Well, look at that!

16:56.449 --> 16:57.684
So do I!

16:57.717 --> 16:59.186
Finally, we agree on something!

16:59.219 --> 17:01.221
(bell dings)
We have a loser!

17:01.254 --> 17:03.056
Congratulations.

17:04.791 --> 17:06.493
Well, all you have
to do is sign.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.396
I can't believe we stayed
married as long as we did.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.131
We're total opposites.

17:11.164 --> 17:13.233
(laughs):
What were we thinking?

17:15.468 --> 17:17.470
This is kind
of sad though.

17:17.504 --> 17:20.340
I mean, our marriage
almost lasted 50 years,

17:20.373 --> 17:22.509
and we're gonna end it
with a couple of signatures

17:22.542 --> 17:24.611
like... like we're
renting a car.

17:24.644 --> 17:25.812
Mom, come on.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.480
Life doesn't end
when you return a rental.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.716
I'm sure some sensible man
in the Midwest

17:29.749 --> 17:31.151
will buy you at auction.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.655
We did have
some good times.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.824
Plus a couple
of wonderful kids.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.459
You're right.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.461
Our marriage does deserve
a better send-off.

17:41.494 --> 17:46.133
Carol Miller, will you do me
the honor of un-marrying me?

17:46.166 --> 17:50.337
You've just made me the
happiest woman on earth.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.276
We did it!
(laughs)

17:56.309 --> 17:57.444
Stop it!

17:57.477 --> 17:59.279
In a minute,
in a minute.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.558
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

18:11.591 --> 18:15.128
to witness the uncoupling
of Tom and Carol Miller.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.896
If their marriage has
taught us anything,

18:16.929 --> 18:19.366
it's that love is
patient, love is kind,

18:19.399 --> 18:22.169
but also sometimes
love is wrong.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.671
Do you, Carol,

18:24.704 --> 18:27.207
take Tom to be
your lawfully-wedded husband?

18:27.240 --> 18:29.676
Do you promise to pull spinach
out of his teeth,

18:29.709 --> 18:32.245
patrol his nose
and ears for hair,

18:32.279 --> 18:35.515
and to always repeat the
punch line to every joke on TV,

18:35.548 --> 18:37.484
in sickness and in health?

18:37.517 --> 18:39.652
I do not.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.592
And do you, Tom, take Carol
to be your lawfully-wedded wife?

18:45.625 --> 18:46.759
Do you promise to rub

18:46.793 --> 18:48.428
lotion on her bunions,

18:48.461 --> 18:50.497
listen to her
conspiracy theories

18:50.530 --> 18:53.600
about who is stealing
her Valu-Pak,

18:53.633 --> 18:55.502
and basically just agree
with everything she says,

18:55.535 --> 18:56.936
as long as you both shall live?

18:56.969 --> 18:59.172
I do not.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.479
Now, if I could have
your wedding rings.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.919
By the power vested in me

19:12.952 --> 19:15.688
by the state of disarray
your marriage is in,

19:15.722 --> 19:18.691
I now pronounce you
ex-husband and ex-wife...

19:18.725 --> 19:20.627
(gasps)

19:20.660 --> 19:23.630
...till death do you stay apart.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.665
(applause)

19:27.667 --> 19:28.935
Yeah!

19:45.918 --> 19:48.821
I can't believe you didn't
pay extra for the cleanup.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.759
Why should some employee get
all this perfectly good rice?

19:55.027 --> 19:56.696
This was a fun day.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.765
But, you know,

19:58.798 --> 20:01.534
there was one thing
we didn't get a chance to do.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.339
We didn't get
to have our last dance.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.882
*

20:21.521 --> 20:22.889
Now that we're divorced,

20:22.922 --> 20:27.794
do you think you can finally
give me a chance to lead?

20:27.827 --> 20:29.829
Nah.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.802
