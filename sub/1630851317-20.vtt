00:01.566 --> 00:03.394
Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:19.236 --> 00:21.369
Here's what you will do.
You will go to college

00:21.412 --> 00:23.980
and study medicine
and this...

00:24.024 --> 00:26.461
nonsense. And when
you graduate,

00:26.504 --> 00:28.202
you and I will
sit down together

00:28.245 --> 00:30.726
and I will decide
what is next.

00:30.769 --> 00:34.425
What would you do if I did not
want you to become a doctor?

00:35.426 --> 00:37.559
Whatever you wanted me to do?

00:38.603 --> 00:40.605
Yes. But what if
it was your decision?

00:40.649 --> 00:42.390
Well...

00:42.433 --> 00:45.132
I guess, hypothetically,

00:45.175 --> 00:47.395
I would move to New York

00:47.438 --> 00:49.701
and see if I can
get into a dance program.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.834
So, when people ask me,
"What does Dele do?"

00:51.877 --> 00:54.924
I'm supposed to say "He's
in New York learning to gyrate"?

00:56.447 --> 00:58.232
How is your suya?

00:58.275 --> 01:00.190
Delicious, thank you.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.453
Is it better than when
she fed it to you yesterday?

01:04.890 --> 01:06.153
Is just as good.

01:06.196 --> 01:09.243
Because your mother reheats your
food with love.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.768
My little Puff Puff,
I need your magic hands.

01:12.811 --> 01:15.075
There's a knot in my neck.

01:15.118 --> 01:17.599
I would worry more about
that hump on your back.

01:17.642 --> 01:20.254
Oh. Hello, Auntie.

01:20.297 --> 01:23.344
I thought I felt the temperature
drop a few degrees.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.914
More pancakes, my little ade?

01:28.958 --> 01:30.220
Mm, no, thank you, Granny.

01:30.264 --> 01:34.137
How about some
freshly-squeezed orange juice?

01:34.181 --> 01:35.443
Oh, that'd be great.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.967
Abishola, squeeze him
some orange juice.

01:39.316 --> 01:41.536
Yes, Mummy.

01:41.579 --> 01:44.278
Boy, I'm not
used to you serving Dele.

01:44.321 --> 01:47.803
My mother is serving Dele,
I am serving her.

01:47.846 --> 01:50.284
Every grandma dotes
on their grandson.

01:50.327 --> 01:53.287
Mine used to take me to get
milkshakes every Saturday.

01:53.330 --> 01:55.463
Well, she took me
to the dog track,

01:55.506 --> 01:57.160
but they sold 'em there.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.380
This is not just about
grandmas and milkshakes.

01:59.423 --> 02:02.557
In Nigeria,
boys are treated like kings.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.167
And the women

02:04.211 --> 02:06.126
are expected to serve them.

02:07.431 --> 02:09.955
Because we are raising men
who will run the family.

02:09.999 --> 02:12.132
And the world.

02:13.437 --> 02:15.657
Bob, would you like Abishola
to make you some pancakes?

02:16.658 --> 02:18.660
I'm good.

02:18.703 --> 02:20.662
Tell me if you need
anything else, Dele.

02:20.705 --> 02:22.707
I will have your mother
get it for you.

02:26.842 --> 02:28.844
Your mother
will not get it for you.

02:28.887 --> 02:30.193
Of course not.

02:30.237 --> 02:31.847
You have no school
this week.

02:31.890 --> 02:32.848
What are your plans?

02:32.891 --> 02:36.417
Um, I'll be studying...

02:36.460 --> 02:37.679
and, you know...

02:37.722 --> 02:39.420
studying.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.161
Do you believe that?

02:41.204 --> 02:43.206
Not his best.
You know, why don't you let him

02:43.250 --> 02:45.208
have the day off
to screw around?

02:45.252 --> 02:47.602
Screw around?

02:47.645 --> 02:50.518
You know, sometimes I forget
I married an American.

02:50.561 --> 02:53.260
Hey, I worked like a dog
when I was his age.

02:53.303 --> 02:54.696
During the summer, my dad
had me in the factory

02:54.739 --> 02:56.698
12 hours a day,
six days a week.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.527
I was 14 when I got
my first hernia.

02:59.570 --> 03:01.442
I thought
working children like that

03:01.485 --> 03:02.791
was illegal in this country.

03:02.834 --> 03:04.836
Not if your family
owns the business.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.099
Interesting.Uh-oh.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.450
Dele, get your things.

03:09.493 --> 03:10.886
You are going to work with Bob.

03:10.929 --> 03:13.105
I... I-I was just
telling a story.

03:13.149 --> 03:14.411
You coulda told a different one.

03:40.611 --> 03:42.047
Don't worry, unlike my old man,

03:42.091 --> 03:44.049
I'm not gonna
bust your butt all day.

03:44.093 --> 03:45.268
I don't mind helping out.

03:45.312 --> 03:47.879
I know, but a factory
is no place for a kid.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.881
Oh, see that scar?

03:49.925 --> 03:52.232
That's where a baling wire
snapped, almost blinded me.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.408
Whoa.It happened right before
the eighth grade dance.

03:54.451 --> 03:57.193
I got to tell you,
ladies love an eye patch.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.716
You're joking.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.415
Yeah. Although, Janice Freidkin
felt sorry for me

04:01.458 --> 04:03.765
and helped me change my gauze.

04:06.158 --> 04:07.551
How many people
work here?

04:07.595 --> 04:10.554
Uh, 153, including
trucking and maintenance.

04:10.598 --> 04:12.469
And a lot of 'em
are second-generation.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.384
I mean, this is
a real family business.

04:14.428 --> 04:16.821
Not just for the Wheelers,
but for all our employees.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.170
That's nice.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.303
I think that's what
I'm most proud of.

04:20.347 --> 04:22.087
I guess I'm a third generation.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.917
I guess you are, buddy.

04:25.961 --> 04:28.616
Hey, let me show you
Old Willy the Finger Collector.

04:28.659 --> 04:29.530
Is that a person?

04:29.573 --> 04:31.140
No, a conveyor belt.

04:34.448 --> 04:37.364
You worry too much.
Your mother is fine.

04:38.626 --> 04:40.323
I am sure you are right.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.760
But she is not answering
her phone or text messages.

04:42.804 --> 04:45.807
She has not even posted
her Wordle score.

04:46.982 --> 04:49.985
Hello? Ogechi?

04:51.160 --> 04:54.642
It seems the dragon
has left her cave.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.339
Please, go in and check.

04:56.383 --> 04:58.515
Okay.

05:00.430 --> 05:02.171
I am so kindhearted.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.612
Hello? Ogechi?

05:08.656 --> 05:11.049
Ogechi?

05:11.093 --> 05:13.225
OGECHI
Help.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.140
What is happening?Oh, no, no, no,

05:15.184 --> 05:16.141
no, no, no, no, no,

05:16.185 --> 05:18.970
no, no, no, no, no.
Oh. Oh...

05:19.014 --> 05:21.146
Kemi, oh, I have fallen.

05:21.190 --> 05:24.019
I can see that.
And many other things.

05:25.150 --> 05:27.022
Is she okay?She fell. Hold on.

05:27.065 --> 05:29.198
What are you doing?

05:29.241 --> 05:31.026
Helping you.Where is my son?

05:31.069 --> 05:32.941
He's at his
pharmacist conference.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.986
I want
Chukwuemeka!

05:35.030 --> 05:36.510
Well, you got me.

05:36.553 --> 05:37.815
Mummy, I am here.

05:37.859 --> 05:38.947
Don't touch me!

05:38.990 --> 05:40.644
How else am I
supposed get you out?

05:40.688 --> 05:42.167
Aah!
Not there.

05:42.211 --> 05:44.169
These are the only handles
I can find!

05:44.213 --> 05:47.172
What is happening?
I cannot see anything.

05:47.216 --> 05:50.219
You want to see
what I'm seeing? Fine.

05:51.525 --> 05:54.049
Turn me away! Turn me away!

05:57.748 --> 06:00.534
And that, my young friend,

06:00.577 --> 06:05.060
is how you turn a flat
piece of cardboard into a box.

06:05.103 --> 06:07.192
That's your whole job?

06:07.236 --> 06:08.411
On a good day.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.152
Does it get boring?

06:10.195 --> 06:12.850
Not if you're super high.

06:12.894 --> 06:14.199
Dele,

06:14.243 --> 06:16.680
let me show you
something over here.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.465
There is nothing
to show you.

06:18.508 --> 06:19.857
I just don't want you infected

06:19.901 --> 06:22.425
by Douglas' lack of ambition.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.384
Can I ask you a question?

06:24.427 --> 06:26.037
His family owns the business.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.039
What am I supposed to do?

06:28.083 --> 06:29.998
No, I was wondering why

06:30.041 --> 06:31.826
you don't automate
some of these processes.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.523
It seems like you could
be doing the same job

06:33.567 --> 06:35.656
with half of the workforce.Excellent question.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.701
I have suggested the same
to Mr. Wheeler.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.703
What did he say?Oh, some nonsense

06:39.747 --> 06:41.401
about workers being family.

06:41.444 --> 06:42.967
Honestly, at a certain point,

06:43.011 --> 06:45.056
I just stopped listening.

06:46.057 --> 06:48.320
Hello, Dele.Hello, Mr. Kofo.

06:48.364 --> 06:50.888
Maybe later you can come and
visit the marketing department.

06:50.932 --> 06:53.195
I'd like that.Today, we are choosing

06:53.238 --> 06:55.850
a new color for the website's
"Buy Now" button.

06:55.893 --> 06:57.460
Fascinating.

06:57.504 --> 06:59.244
It is.

06:59.288 --> 07:02.117
You did not hear it from me,
but the front-runner is...

07:03.553 --> 07:05.773
...blue!

07:06.817 --> 07:09.080
His job is the first
I would automate.

07:09.124 --> 07:10.604
Dele!

07:10.647 --> 07:12.432
This one's for you.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.919
Can you give her something
for the pain?

07:21.963 --> 07:24.487
Sorry, not till she's admitted.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.836
Aah!

07:25.880 --> 07:27.577
Can you give me something?

07:27.621 --> 07:30.754
Oh, where is my son?

07:30.798 --> 07:33.278
He is in Rhode Island
making a speech.

07:33.322 --> 07:36.717
Tell him to come home.He's receiving the
Pharmacist of the Year award.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.283
Do you want to take that
away from him?

07:38.327 --> 07:39.633
No.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.156
Then suck it up.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.549
Who will take care of me?

07:42.592 --> 07:44.725
We can find somebody
on the Internet.

07:44.768 --> 07:47.771
I had a shelf built
by a TaskRabbit.

07:47.815 --> 07:50.600
Oh, I do not want a stranger
looking after me.

07:50.644 --> 07:53.385
Well, your other choice is me.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.867
Call the rabbit.

08:01.045 --> 08:03.483
How about this? You're
on the packing line,

08:03.526 --> 08:04.919
you see a couple
of socks roll by

08:04.962 --> 08:07.138
without the MaxDot logo.
What do you do?

08:07.182 --> 08:08.792
Halt distribution,
do QC for the whole shipment,

08:08.836 --> 08:10.620
and call Goodwin.

08:10.664 --> 08:12.666
What if Goodwin's not there?Goodwin's always there.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.277
The kid's a natural.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.800
Sounds like
you learned a lot today.

08:16.844 --> 08:18.628
I had no idea how much goes into

08:18.672 --> 08:20.543
getting a pair of socks
to the store.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.414
Tell her about the boxes.

08:22.458 --> 08:25.243
Douglas makes boxes.Oh, yeah.

08:25.287 --> 08:27.550
Did you show him Old Willy?Yeah, I showed him.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.596
Did you see the Polaroids
of the severed fingers?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.423
I did. It was horrible.

08:31.467 --> 08:32.599
Isn't it?

08:33.556 --> 08:36.124
I asked to work at the factory
when I was a teenager.

08:36.167 --> 08:38.518
But she wouldn't let me.

08:38.561 --> 08:40.345
Forgive me for not wanting
my daughter to get knocked up

08:40.389 --> 08:42.522
by some four-fingered man.

08:42.565 --> 08:45.394
Tomorrow you are coming to work
with me at the hospital.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.614
That's it?
I get him one day?

08:47.657 --> 08:50.312
He cannot learn how to be
a doctor in a sock factory.

08:50.355 --> 08:53.794
For your information,
Javier had five fingers.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.797
It as an eye he was missing.

08:58.015 --> 09:00.583
Oh! Did you tell her
about the boxes?

09:02.411 --> 09:04.761
Yeah, take him to the hospital.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.297
Doesn't he look good
in his scrubs?

09:19.341 --> 09:21.952
Yep, a real Doogie Howser.

09:21.996 --> 09:24.433
You know, when I was
pregnant with him

09:24.476 --> 09:26.130
and people asked me
what I was having

09:26.174 --> 09:28.959
I told them, "a doctor."

09:30.221 --> 09:32.963
I don't understand how this
is preparing me for that.

09:33.007 --> 09:35.357
Less talking, more mopping.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.187
Do not worry, I will be there
when she gets out of surgery.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.843
Yes, I told her you loved her.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.586
No, I will not give her
a big kiss for you.

09:47.761 --> 09:50.851
Fine, I will give her
a big kiss for you.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.330
What's going on?

09:52.374 --> 09:54.028
Chukwuemeka's mother
fell in the shower

09:54.071 --> 09:55.507
and broke her hip.

09:55.551 --> 09:56.900
That's terrible.Oh, no.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.859
I know, it's been
such an ordeal.

09:58.902 --> 10:00.295
For me.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.515
What is he
doing here?

10:03.559 --> 10:05.256
Becoming a doctor.

10:05.300 --> 10:07.694
That is wonderful.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.826
When you are done with the
floor, come to the kitchen,

10:09.870 --> 10:13.134
I have some pots
you can clean, Doctor.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.834
What, do you think you're
talking to some idiot who

10:17.878 --> 10:20.707
doesn't know the market price
of superfine merino wool?

10:22.883 --> 10:24.362
Don't give me that.

10:24.406 --> 10:26.582
You don't shear sheep.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.803
Then don't try to rob me.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.414
Thirteen.

10:36.592 --> 10:38.855
So, what else is new?
How's the family?

10:38.899 --> 10:41.945
Good. My son
graduates college this year.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.468
Oh, great,

10:43.512 --> 10:44.687
what's he gonna do--
come work for you?

10:44.731 --> 10:47.908
No, he wants to be
an influencer.

10:47.951 --> 10:48.952
What's that mean?

10:48.996 --> 10:51.694
It means
I have failed as a father.

10:51.738 --> 10:54.088
So, what about you?

10:54.131 --> 10:55.437
How are the Africans?

10:55.480 --> 10:56.960
Good. Uh, my stepson

10:57.004 --> 10:58.570
came to work with me
the other day.

10:58.614 --> 11:01.486
Is he going to take over
the business when you retire?

11:01.530 --> 11:04.054
No, his mom
wants him to be a doctor.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.796
You think she would
talk to my son?

11:06.840 --> 11:09.930
I could ask.
Oh, before I forget,

11:09.973 --> 11:12.280
I need a price
on compression sleeves.

11:12.323 --> 11:13.934
Let me look it up.

11:16.763 --> 11:20.723
Oh, my, the prices
have gone through the roof.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.291
You son of a bitch,
don't you start with me.

11:25.510 --> 11:26.555
I will.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.297
How do you sleep at night?

11:43.180 --> 11:45.748
You remember Chukwuemeka,
Auntie Kemi's friend?

11:45.792 --> 11:47.010
Yes.

11:47.054 --> 11:49.926
The woman on the operating table
is his mother.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.929
The surgeon is going to
cut off her hip with a bone saw

11:52.973 --> 11:55.323
and replace it with titanium.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.933
A bone saw?

11:56.977 --> 11:59.283
Yes, it is a saw
used to cut bone.

12:00.676 --> 12:02.373
Ooh, look, he's starting to cut.

12:02.417 --> 12:04.724
Oh, my...

12:04.767 --> 12:06.377
It is amazing, isn't it?

12:07.683 --> 12:09.641
There's so much blood.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.775
Yes, the adult human body holds

12:12.819 --> 12:14.646
one and a half gallons of blood.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.606
It looks like a lot more.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.651
And he hasn't even
hit the muscle yet.

12:22.306 --> 12:23.177
Are you all right?

12:23.220 --> 12:25.657
Mm-hmm.

12:25.701 --> 12:27.050
No, you are not. Sit down.

12:31.185 --> 12:32.839
I am so sorry.

12:32.882 --> 12:35.363
It's all right.
Just breathe. Breathe.

12:36.756 --> 12:41.195
Okay. You're right.
I'm good.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.979
Totally good.

12:43.023 --> 12:45.025
I am not good.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.903
She looks quite peaceful.

12:53.947 --> 12:57.211
Like a snapping turtle
sunning on a rock.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.822
Bible study starts soon.

12:59.866 --> 13:02.216
We may have to leave
before she wakes.

13:02.259 --> 13:06.176
But if we go, we will not
get credit for the visit.

13:06.220 --> 13:07.830
Hello.Eh.

13:07.874 --> 13:10.790
Tell her we stopped by
and those flowers are from us.

13:10.833 --> 13:12.574
And that I was
weepy with concern.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.843
Oh, you.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.497
Yes, me.

13:22.540 --> 13:25.282
Who sent the flowers?

13:26.588 --> 13:28.155
Also me.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.201
Your surgery went well.

13:31.245 --> 13:32.724
Good.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.726
Where is my son?Right now

13:34.770 --> 13:36.728
he is receiving
the Ibuprofen Award

13:36.772 --> 13:39.340
for Excellence
in Pharmaceutical Sciences.

13:40.384 --> 13:42.734
And he left me with a witch.

13:42.778 --> 13:44.649
Okay, I'm taking my flowers.

13:44.693 --> 13:47.217
No, please stay.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.219
I do not want to be alone.

13:49.263 --> 13:51.613
I am always alone.

13:51.656 --> 13:55.008
Perhaps if you stopped
calling people witches...

13:59.316 --> 14:01.884
Most people do not like me.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.451
It has beenthat way

14:03.494 --> 14:06.410
since I was little.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.630
My mother used to say that

14:08.673 --> 14:11.633
I am just unlikable.

14:11.676 --> 14:14.897
Your mother was very wise.

14:14.941 --> 14:17.726
My son does not think
I am unlikeable.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.597
He loves me.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.382
Yes, he does.

14:21.425 --> 14:22.949
He loves you, too.

14:24.298 --> 14:26.256
Yes, he does.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.910
Which means we are

14:27.954 --> 14:31.261
the luckiest girls in the world.

14:31.305 --> 14:33.089
We are.

14:33.133 --> 14:35.091
Well...

14:35.135 --> 14:37.441
one girl and one witch.

14:48.583 --> 14:50.802
You okay?

14:50.846 --> 14:52.500
I could not sleep.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.329
What's going on?

14:55.372 --> 14:56.852
How is Dele
going to become a doctor

14:56.896 --> 14:58.810
if he gets sick
at the sight of blood?

14:58.854 --> 15:02.031
Yeah, that's a problem.
But better he found out now.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.685
Better for who?

15:03.728 --> 15:06.296
Everybody?

15:07.732 --> 15:09.778
Tea?Thank you.

15:11.432 --> 15:14.130
I know him being a doctor
was everything you ever wanted.

15:14.174 --> 15:16.132
Everything he ever wanted.

15:16.176 --> 15:17.786
Right, exactly, same thing.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.180
The good news is

15:20.223 --> 15:22.312
whatever he decides
to do with his life,

15:22.356 --> 15:23.966
he'll be great at it.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.491
He is going to become a doctor.I know.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.276
Stop saying you know.
You do not know.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.365
Boy, ain't that the truth.

15:33.367 --> 15:36.500
Maybe every day we can
build up his tolerance.

15:36.544 --> 15:39.460
Expose him
to more and more blood.

15:40.548 --> 15:43.203
Where are you gonna
get all that blood?

15:43.246 --> 15:45.683
I'll find a way.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.163
Well, if you can't,

15:47.207 --> 15:48.904
he can always
help me sell socks.

15:50.079 --> 15:51.298
You'll find the blood.

15:57.913 --> 16:00.524
Here, I made you some tea.

16:00.568 --> 16:02.396
I need my pain pill.

16:02.439 --> 16:03.658
It is not time yet.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.268
But it hurts.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.835
If I give it to you now,

16:06.878 --> 16:10.491
you will become a drug addict
living under a bridge.

16:10.534 --> 16:13.015
Fine. Give me the remote.
My show is on.

16:14.974 --> 16:18.586
Okay. But soon you have to try
walking on your new hip.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.283
I am afraid.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.371
The last time
I was on my feet,

16:21.415 --> 16:23.939
I fell and suffered for hours.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.636
Stop trying to cheer me up.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.946
Can we at least watch a movie?

16:30.990 --> 16:33.905
I cannot stand any more of your
ridiculous reality show.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.820
But it is the finale.

16:35.864 --> 16:39.650
Cole has to give his room key
to either Jenny or Alicia.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.218
He's obviously going
to choose Alicia.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.655
Jenny is so basic.

16:44.699 --> 16:47.484
I do not know.
Sometimes men love women

16:47.528 --> 16:49.443
for no good reason at all.

16:50.705 --> 16:54.622
Or maybe one fantastic reason.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.232
What does that mean?

16:56.276 --> 16:58.234
It means you are not
the only one

16:58.278 --> 17:00.019
who has suffered a hip injury.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.153
Mummy.

17:04.197 --> 17:05.328
My son!

17:05.372 --> 17:06.373
How are you feeling?Better,

17:06.416 --> 17:07.765
now that you are here.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.985
How can I thank you
for taking care of her?

17:10.029 --> 17:13.641
Oh, you know how.

17:13.684 --> 17:16.383
What gifts did you bring us
from this Rhode Island?

17:16.426 --> 17:18.254
There was no time.
I hurried home.

17:18.298 --> 17:21.605
You brought your mother nothing?
She was near death.

17:21.649 --> 17:22.693
You said she was fine.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.260
I didn't want you to worry

17:24.304 --> 17:27.785
because I am always
thinking of others.

17:27.829 --> 17:29.048
This is true.

17:30.136 --> 17:33.400
I have to say, it is nice
to see you two getting along.

17:35.097 --> 17:35.967
What is he talking about?

17:36.011 --> 17:37.099
We are not getting along.

17:37.143 --> 17:38.883
She is rude.And she is a witch.

17:38.927 --> 17:41.277
Oh, my show is starting.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.800
Popcorn?

17:42.844 --> 17:44.846
Yes, please.Mm-hmm.

17:46.761 --> 17:48.763
I will go make some.

17:51.026 --> 17:53.115
Please, God,
make it Alicia.

17:53.159 --> 17:55.509
May He hear your prayers.
