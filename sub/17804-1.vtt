Ed?

02:06.640 --> 02:09.530
Look, I'm twerkin', darling.
I'm twerkin'.

02:09.759 --> 02:10.761
No, you're not.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.446
Isn't that twerking?

02:12.720 --> 02:14.210
No, move your bum.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.811
Ooh.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.171
Dysfunctional

02:21.240 --> 02:22.241
Get ugly

02:30.600 --> 02:32.125
You're too sexy to me

02:32.440 --> 02:35.205
Sweetheart, darling? Saff?

02:41.680 --> 02:43.330
Your grandmother's home.

02:43.440 --> 02:46.683
Darling! Sweetheart!
Darling! Sweetheart!

02:47.120 --> 02:48.485
Darling!

03:07.800 --> 03:09.689
Wakey, wakey,
my lady.

03:09.800 --> 03:12.565
Oh, get out, get out.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.565
You have meetings, meetings, meetings...

03:15.840 --> 03:17.569
parties, openings.

03:20.720 --> 03:21.721
Pats?

03:22.160 --> 03:23.764
Pats!
What?

03:23.840 --> 03:25.365
Today's the day I sign the deal

03:25.440 --> 03:26.805
on my book deal, darling.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.607
Oh! Fabulous.

03:29.840 --> 03:31.604
Yeah, fabulous.

03:31.840 --> 03:33.285
Am I in it?

03:33.600 --> 03:35.409
Of course you're in it, darling,

03:35.480 --> 03:38.450
because you are my oldest, oldest friend.

03:38.520 --> 03:39.521
Mmm-hmm.

03:40.520 --> 03:42.727
And who will play me, Eddy?

03:43.320 --> 03:45.607
Well, darling,
it's only just nearly a book.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.131
It will be a film, though, sweetheart,

03:47.200 --> 03:48.531
because it's about me, isn't it?

03:48.720 --> 03:52.441
It's about London's
premier fashion P. R.

03:53.720 --> 03:54.721
Fabulous.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.645
And who will play me, Eddy?
Not Jane Fonda.

03:58.200 --> 03:59.201
Why?

03:59.600 --> 04:00.886
I've had stem cells

04:00.960 --> 04:02.450
and the blood of
a 2-year-old child

04:02.520 --> 04:04.648
injected in my skin
and I still look like this.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.922
You need to use fetus blood, Eddy.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.401
A little spritz of afterbirth, darling.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.483
Oh.
Keep up, sweetie.

04:14.440 --> 04:15.930
Oh!

04:16.200 --> 04:17.611
I want to go in there,

04:17.680 --> 04:19.363
but I have to get past that big mirror.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.286
I think I am now officially
fatter sideways

04:22.360 --> 04:23.566
than I am front on.

04:23.760 --> 04:26.650
Darling, you don't
need those.
I am your mirror.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.646
How do I look?

04:29.760 --> 04:31.489
Fabulous.
Thank you.

04:33.760 --> 04:34.761
Ooh.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.924
Need to move that, Eddy.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.243
I'll call Kelly Hoppen.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.881
Fabulous.

04:41.800 --> 04:43.245
Morning.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.806
Afternoon.

04:45.000 --> 04:47.810
When did these stairs
get so long?

04:48.000 --> 04:49.729
Since you dug into
middle earth.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.922
Oh, yes.
Good though, isn't it?

04:52.320 --> 04:53.606
Bo and Marshall rang.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.290
Both of them?

04:55.360 --> 04:56.930
They want to come
and talk about the house.

04:57.320 --> 04:59.288
Why do they want to talk about the house?

04:59.640 --> 05:00.801
I don't know.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.490
Go outside!

05:02.680 --> 05:03.920
Eddy, I'm vaping.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.010
No, darling, you lit it,
that's a cigarette.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.481
And she's a child.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.001
Then why can't she
go outside into the air?

05:10.480 --> 05:12.289
Your mother's here.

05:12.480 --> 05:13.720
Oh, Christ.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.325
How long is this one here for?

05:15.400 --> 05:16.481
When's she going back?

05:16.680 --> 05:17.647
I don't know.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.688
All I know is it's something
else I'm paying for.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.490
I'm not going back to Africa.

05:21.560 --> 05:23.483
If Dad wants to see me, he can come here.

05:23.760 --> 05:25.125
Why isn't he paying for her?

05:25.240 --> 05:26.605
Mum, we're divorced.

05:26.840 --> 05:28.683
Well, he can't just sit in Ebola

05:28.760 --> 05:31.604
or wherever he is, darling,
and not pay for her.

05:31.760 --> 05:32.966
Gabon?

05:33.600 --> 05:34.726
What?

05:34.920 --> 05:36.285
Gabon?

05:38.440 --> 05:39.441
Gabon?

05:39.760 --> 05:41.762
Why is she...
Why are you saying Gabon?

05:41.960 --> 05:43.530
Is he still in Gabon?

05:44.520 --> 05:46.329
Is he still in Gabon?
No.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.931
No! No.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.526
Dad's paying for me.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.851
He gave me a credit card.

05:51.920 --> 05:53.490
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:53.600 --> 05:55.841
Talking about
credit cards. Bubble?

05:56.520 --> 06:00.320
All of my cards are broken.
Fix them, please.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.091
Eddy, I'm thirsty.
Morning, Mrs. M.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.329
Morning, Patsy, dear.

06:06.320 --> 06:07.651
I'll open a Bolly.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.764
Darling, where is the champagne?

06:11.840 --> 06:13.001
I don't know.

06:15.000 --> 06:17.321
Where's the Bolly?
Where's the champagne?

06:17.480 --> 06:19.482
If you want things,
you have to pay for them.

06:19.640 --> 06:20.880
Since when?

06:21.080 --> 06:24.084
Sounds like you'll have to
tighten your belt, dear.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.361
Oh.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.768
If you manage that, it'll be a first.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.567
Don't let her eat anything
while she's here.

06:30.640 --> 06:31.880
All right? No eaty.

06:32.360 --> 06:34.124
Eddy, what are we
going to do
without champagne?

06:35.480 --> 06:37.369
That'll be Bo and Marshall.

06:38.880 --> 06:39.927
Hi, hi, hi.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.041
Hello, there.

06:41.760 --> 06:44.161
No need to rush, honey.
Be careful.

06:44.400 --> 06:45.481
All of this is new.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.801
Hello, everybody.

06:46.920 --> 06:47.921
Oh, hello, there.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.488
Let's get up here, one, two, three.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.361
Now tell her why we're here.

06:53.840 --> 06:56.730
I can't go on with the house payments.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.363
You paid for all this?
Yes.

06:59.600 --> 07:02.604
Well, darling,
that's how divorce works.
Learn.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.404
He needs surgery.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.888
Yes. We can tell them.
Marshall is a transgender.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.684
He'd like to
live as a woman.

07:09.920 --> 07:12.844
Oh, that's typical.
Jumping on the bandwagon.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.922
Finally she gets to cut your balls off!

07:15.160 --> 07:18.687
Oh, well, I don't need
your measly payments.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.721
I've got a book deal.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.171
Come on, Pats.

07:23.520 --> 07:26.524
At least you're small.
You'll be able
to get shoes.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.082
So when does it come off?

07:29.480 --> 07:32.723
Oh, we haven't
gone through "coming off"
therapy yet.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.165
Darling, come with me today.

07:35.400 --> 07:36.731
I'm putting the final touches to...

07:36.880 --> 07:39.167
the Huki Muki retrospective launch party.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.085
Can Lulu
sing at that?
No.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.201
Oh, no, no, that all has to go back.

07:44.480 --> 07:45.720
That's all got to go back.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.724
Eddy, how long have we got this for?

07:47.880 --> 07:49.769
Oh, they've lent it for Emma Bunton,

07:49.840 --> 07:50.887
but they don't mind.

07:51.080 --> 07:52.730
No, they want it back.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.571
Exercise, exercise,
exercise... done!

07:56.640 --> 07:58.483
And coming up
on "Woman's Hour",

07:58.560 --> 08:00.722
was Shakespeare's wife depressed?

08:01.000 --> 08:02.764
But first, here in the studio we have

08:02.840 --> 08:05.571
P.R. supremo Claudia Bing,
a woman...

08:05.760 --> 08:06.761
with her finger on the pulse.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.889
Oh, turn that shit off.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.806
There was a time
the zeitgeist
blew through me.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.764
Now it's just...

08:15.000 --> 08:17.207
A tiny fart.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.201
Eddy, look.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.967
Quite close by.
Ooh.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.005
No, I'm all right.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.731
Had him, had him, had him, had him.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.001
Eddy, can we stop at the Wolseley?

08:33.480 --> 08:35.607
No, darling, my cards are broken.

08:36.480 --> 08:37.765
Chiltern Firehouse?

08:38.000 --> 08:40.048
My cards are broken!

08:41.480 --> 08:43.164
Well, haven't you got any of that...

08:45.760 --> 08:47.046
hand money?

08:47.480 --> 08:48.766
No.

08:54.480 --> 08:55.606
What is that?

08:55.960 --> 08:57.246
Chanel No. 5.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.051
No, I'm all right.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.529
Show them your breasts.
No.

09:03.800 --> 09:05.529
Oh, come on.
Leave it, Bo.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.961
Women, can't live with 'em,
can't...

09:08.520 --> 09:10.522
Is this little Lola?

09:10.640 --> 09:11.880
Oh.

09:11.960 --> 09:12.961
Africa.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.205
We are sisters.
My people are your people.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.801
Which people?

09:18.040 --> 09:20.520
Black people.
I am a black person.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.086
Deep down, we are all black.

09:24.160 --> 09:25.161
Oh!

09:35.200 --> 09:38.682
So, can I have
an advance?

09:38.840 --> 09:42.083
No. What is this?
I just don't get it.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.606
Well, this isn't how it would be written.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.842
This is how I dictated it to Bubble.

09:48.560 --> 09:50.085
Bubble. What is Bubble?

09:50.760 --> 09:52.000
My P.A., Bubble.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.889
Oh, I thought it was new software.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.800
You see, I'm just not really understanding

09:59.880 --> 10:01.644
anything you say.

10:02.120 --> 10:03.849
I need a coffee.

10:04.560 --> 10:05.561
Coffee!

10:06.560 --> 10:09.131
I mean,
the world of P. R.
Mmm.

10:09.320 --> 10:11.766
Who really knows
what P. R. is?

10:12.000 --> 10:14.685
P. R. is everything.
I am P. R.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.604
I took Sting and
put him in the rainforest,

10:16.720 --> 10:18.245
gave the little pygmies a party.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.842
I put Bono behind yellow glasses.

10:20.920 --> 10:22.331
I gave celebrities AIDS.

10:24.240 --> 10:25.890
The T-shirt.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.884
Anyway, look...

10:28.120 --> 10:29.884
there's not enough here.

10:31.720 --> 10:32.881
What do you mean, not enough?

10:32.960 --> 10:36.282
There's pages and pages.
I dictated it to Bubble.

10:37.800 --> 10:40.610
It mostly just says,
"Blah, blah, blah."

10:45.040 --> 10:47.008
Who do you
represent in P. R.?

10:48.160 --> 10:50.367
Well, it's not just the "who's",

10:50.600 --> 10:52.921
it's the "what's".
It's the likes of...

10:53.080 --> 10:55.287
Not the "likes of", the "actuals".

10:57.280 --> 10:58.611
The singer Lulu.

10:59.160 --> 11:00.366
Who else?

11:02.640 --> 11:04.165
Spice Emma, Baby Bunton.

11:04.760 --> 11:05.921
And?

11:07.640 --> 11:08.641
Queen Noor.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.761
I have a huge
boutique vodka.
I have Pop-Specs.

11:14.640 --> 11:15.641
Joel.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.290
Graham! Graham, I know you.
I know him.

11:19.640 --> 11:20.641
He loves me.

11:20.840 --> 11:22.410
I don't love you.
You're gay, come on.

11:22.760 --> 11:25.331
I don't love you!
Leave me alone.

11:25.720 --> 11:27.324
I don't know what's wrong with him.

11:28.120 --> 11:29.326
All my friends are gay.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.971
And Nigella!
Yes. I know Nigella.

11:33.200 --> 11:35.771
Write a chapter on that.
Me and Nigella...

11:36.000 --> 11:38.651
eating late at night...
in a fridge.

11:38.880 --> 11:39.881
No.

11:40.960 --> 11:42.962
Can I have an advance?
No.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.121
Why?

11:44.280 --> 11:45.327
Because it's shit.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.406
Eddy, let's go.

11:48.960 --> 11:49.961
I'll be late.

11:54.200 --> 11:56.362
You only read 'em.
You don't write 'em.

11:57.960 --> 12:00.088
You just work in the shop.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.446
You think your life's
interesting. It isn't.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.170
It may be worth living,
but it's not worth reading.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.009
It's happened. Move on.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.322
Bloody, bloody books!
Bloody books!

12:17.400 --> 12:19.368
Blah, blah, blah!
Bloody books!

12:22.040 --> 12:24.930
I have to check
the Huki Muki mannequins
before tonight.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.729
Coming with me, Eds?

12:26.800 --> 12:27.801
No, I can't.

12:28.400 --> 12:31.324
I've got that P. R. persons
lunch-of-the-month lunch.

12:31.720 --> 12:32.721
Brunch.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.809
A munch-of-the-munch munch?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.411
Not munch. Lunch.

12:36.800 --> 12:38.040
Oh, kill her, Eddy.

12:38.160 --> 12:39.400
What are we going to?

12:39.800 --> 12:40.926
Have you rung Lulu yet?

12:41.000 --> 12:42.490
Oh, shut up about Lulu.

12:42.720 --> 12:43.926
Don't rush me.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.763
I haven't got any money.

12:46.840 --> 12:48.808
Get someone to pay at the other end.

12:49.280 --> 12:50.770
Where's my car?

12:50.840 --> 12:52.410
It's gone back to Baby Bunton.

12:52.800 --> 12:53.801
But I need wheels!

12:53.960 --> 12:54.961
Oh!

12:55.160 --> 12:58.050
But you were only given feet.

12:58.200 --> 12:59.361
Oh, shut up.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.766
Yeah. Love. Love.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.161
Hate.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.124
Put the fishtail next to the red blob.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.089
And change that mannequin, it's too fat.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.770
Why are we doing this by the river?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.205
It stinks of fish.

13:20.440 --> 13:22.169
Is that you? Good grief.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.243
What's the food?
Oh, raw.

13:24.360 --> 13:25.646
Freshly dead, octopus with a pulse?

13:25.720 --> 13:26.687
Yeah.

13:26.760 --> 13:27.761
Cocktails?

13:27.880 --> 13:29.405
The mixologist is Madeira Slice.

13:29.480 --> 13:32.848
He's doing his flaming
gasoline herbal
labia cocktails.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.411
No olives.
No.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.330
Oh, Metro wants a paragraph.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.887
Oh, Patsy Stone, fashion editor, The A.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.003
Fashion designer Huki Muki

13:41.080 --> 13:43.082
makes Valentino look like Topshop.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.482
Disorientating beauty juxtaposed

13:45.560 --> 13:47.801
between life and death...
and shoes.

13:48.080 --> 13:50.481
Yeah, all that shit, but more importantly,

13:50.600 --> 13:52.204
our magazine is sponsoring it.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.442
I want Huki Muki smaller, our logo bigger.

13:54.560 --> 13:55.925
Yeah, Magda.

13:56.200 --> 13:58.806
Oi, Pats.
I've just been
with Valentino.

13:59.080 --> 14:00.081
What's left of him?

14:00.240 --> 14:02.163
Not much. He's a small
lizard handbag

14:02.240 --> 14:03.571
with a hoverboard of hair.

14:05.360 --> 14:06.850
Shut up!
Ooh!

14:07.800 --> 14:09.370
Guest list, now.
Right.

14:09.560 --> 14:14.282
Okay, we have got
all the Jenners and Tyga...

14:14.480 --> 14:16.960
Suki, Cara, David...

14:17.240 --> 14:21.245
Kanye. We have Dolce,
but not Gabbana. Okay.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.881
SamCam, I don't know who...

14:23.960 --> 14:26.247
Ai Wuhwuh... Ai Weiwuh...
Weiwie...

14:26.840 --> 14:27.966
Am I going deaf

14:28.040 --> 14:30.122
or have you not said "Kate Moss" yet?

14:30.280 --> 14:31.645
Apart from the fact

14:31.880 --> 14:33.166
me head's full of fish fumes...

14:33.360 --> 14:35.601
it's impossible because
she's left her P. R.

14:37.120 --> 14:38.645
I shouldn't have said that, it's secret.

14:38.880 --> 14:40.120
Delete, delete.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.282
I don't care.
Just get her here.

14:42.520 --> 14:45.046
Offer her ayahuasca and shamans

14:45.120 --> 14:46.849
and enough vodka to kill cattle.

14:47.040 --> 14:50.328
I'm off to Chanel.
Lagerfeld waits for no man.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.284
Get me an Uber.
A minicab?

14:52.480 --> 14:56.326
Helicopter!
I don't do traffic!

14:57.080 --> 14:58.206
Bag.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.970
Chanel, Chanel!

15:00.040 --> 15:01.610
I can't bloody work with that shit!

15:05.520 --> 15:07.488
Welcome, everybody,
to this month's

15:07.560 --> 15:09.881
P.R. person-of-the-month
lunch.

15:10.520 --> 15:13.285
Eat. It's all free.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.885
Nothing is free anymore.
Even freedom isn't free.

15:18.160 --> 15:19.491
It used to be.

15:19.560 --> 15:21.449
But now everybody wants your PIN number.

15:21.640 --> 15:24.530
Sure they do, old girl.
Sure they do.

15:24.880 --> 15:25.881
Say nothing.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.206
Edina.

15:27.520 --> 15:28.487
Claudia.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.005
I hear you've just been to a meeting

15:30.080 --> 15:32.811
with my friend Joel at Random Penguin.

15:32.880 --> 15:33.881
Yeah, it went really well.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.329
He said how it went.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.006
Ladies and gentlemen,
Claudia Bing.

15:39.200 --> 15:43.649
Thank you, guys.
So proud
to be yet again...

15:44.040 --> 15:47.522
the P. R. person's
P. R. person of the month.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.568
We will continue to run campaigns...

15:52.000 --> 15:54.367
with the...
"sergeny"?

15:54.560 --> 15:55.766
Synergy.

15:55.880 --> 15:57.041
Oh, synergy.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.010
Shooting up and...
Out.

16:00.040 --> 16:02.930
Out.
Shooting out on Twitter...

16:03.120 --> 16:06.124
and joining up all those conversations.

16:06.360 --> 16:08.488
Do we do that?
No.

16:08.920 --> 16:13.926
Who knew that a blog post
could do more than
a banner or cookie engagement?

16:14.160 --> 16:15.685
Do you feed my Twitter?

16:16.040 --> 16:19.249
No, I forgot. And it died.

16:27.560 --> 16:29.403
These days, you can't get by

16:29.480 --> 16:32.211
with a couple
of old pop stars
and a vodka.

16:33.360 --> 16:36.967
It's a boutique vodka!
It's a huge boutique vodka!

16:40.360 --> 16:42.567
Eddy! Top secret, darling.

16:42.640 --> 16:43.971
You don't know this...

16:44.160 --> 16:46.640
and I don't know this, but, darling...

16:47.080 --> 16:48.969
Kate Moss
is changing her P.R.!

16:51.400 --> 16:52.970
Darling? Kate Moss!

16:53.240 --> 16:54.605
Oh, shut up! Stop!

16:54.960 --> 16:56.166
Eds, darling,

16:56.240 --> 16:59.084
she's going to be at the Huki Muki.

16:59.280 --> 17:00.964
Shut up! Shut up!

17:01.200 --> 17:02.281
No one else will know.

17:02.360 --> 17:03.725
Don't let that bitch Bing know.

17:05.520 --> 17:06.521
Damn!

17:06.640 --> 17:08.404
So common.

17:10.720 --> 17:11.721
Ooh!

17:15.119 --> 17:16.121
Lola!

17:16.400 --> 17:18.402
Lola!
What?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.210
Have you seen Gran?

17:25.280 --> 17:27.281
Hi.
Hi. Hi.

17:30.800 --> 17:31.801
Oh.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.645
Um, are you okay?
You seem a bit flustered.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.450
Yeah, uh, no. Uh...

17:36.640 --> 17:38.881
I just need to see Gran
off to the airport.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.322
My mother's looking after Lola tonight.

17:41.480 --> 17:43.164
Should I
meet your mother?
No.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.681
Okay.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.810
Sorry.
It's fine.

17:47.320 --> 17:48.560
Can I kiss you properly now?

17:48.640 --> 17:50.483
I've been thinking about it all day.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.844
Sorry.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.925
Oh, my God.

17:58.160 --> 17:59.685
I can't believe that face

17:59.760 --> 18:01.603
came from the womb of the little dumpster.

18:01.800 --> 18:02.847
Excuse me?

18:03.160 --> 18:05.606
Tonight, Lola,
you are my
perfect accessory.

18:05.720 --> 18:07.688
Oh, she won't need much, darling.

18:07.840 --> 18:09.649
If raw material was the finished article,

18:09.720 --> 18:11.370
there'd be no point of me.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.488
I'm going to straighten and shimmer.

18:13.680 --> 18:14.727
Ow! Ow!
Go for it.

18:14.920 --> 18:17.605
Just take the pain, bitch.
Your hair will straighten.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.647
Ow!

18:18.720 --> 18:20.688
Beyoncé cried, too, but she surrendered.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.761
Ow!

18:25.520 --> 18:26.681
Don't stop.

18:26.840 --> 18:30.367
There's something in the suitcase?

18:37.760 --> 18:39.489
Where am I?

18:39.720 --> 18:40.960
Oh, Gran!

18:42.480 --> 18:43.527
What's she doing?

18:43.720 --> 18:45.563
I'm off to Cannes, dear.

18:45.760 --> 18:48.366
She's going
to Aunt Violet's
birthday party.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.891
Why don't I know about this?

18:50.280 --> 18:52.601
We didn't want you to know, dear.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.808
It's going to be very sprauncy.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.405
Oh!

18:56.520 --> 18:59.524
No, no, leave it!
It's Pats. Patsy.

19:00.880 --> 19:02.291
Hi, darling.

19:02.360 --> 19:03.407
Got some threads for the midget.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.721
Leave them there.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.770
Oh, I smell pigs, Eddy.
I smell rozzers.

19:08.520 --> 19:12.241
Oh, just a thought.
Will I need
injections, Saffy?

19:12.440 --> 19:13.646
Yeah, lethal ones.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.451
Bonjour.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.526
You just met my mother.

19:19.240 --> 19:20.810
She seems nice.

19:22.680 --> 19:23.727
Look up.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.245
Okay, I'm looking up.

19:26.920 --> 19:28.365
Patsy's here.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.521
Ugh.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.523
Darling, it's pretty exciting, isn't it?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.443
Tonight is going to change everything.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.603
Oh, my God, what's happening?

19:35.920 --> 19:38.685
No, Eddy.
What?

19:39.800 --> 19:41.802
I'm going to...
Don't tell him, Eddy.

19:42.560 --> 19:43.561
Tell him, Eddy.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.601
I'm gonna get Kate Moss!
I'm her new P. R.!

19:51.960 --> 19:53.689
Go on, go to Patsy.

20:01.960 --> 20:03.724
We all love you.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.610
We love you.
We love you.

20:05.800 --> 20:08.485
We thought we'd go to Goa
for an Ayurvedic colonic.

20:08.720 --> 20:10.449
It's totes amaze.
So beautiful.

20:10.640 --> 20:12.847
Edina has to come.
She has to.

20:13.600 --> 20:15.443
Or we could go out.

20:15.520 --> 20:16.931
There's that new club, FoFo BoBo.

20:17.320 --> 20:19.084
Who's D.J.-ing?
Dead Mice.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.323
I love Dead Mice.

20:22.520 --> 20:24.602
Oh, Edina, you have to come.

20:24.800 --> 20:26.802
Stella will give you
all the clothes you need.

20:27.320 --> 20:29.527
I would love to dress you.

20:30.320 --> 20:31.606
Oh, Eddy...

20:31.840 --> 20:34.002
you're my favorite person
in the whole world.

20:34.080 --> 20:36.003
You have to do my P. R.

20:36.280 --> 20:37.884
Please, you have to.

20:38.720 --> 20:40.006
Please?
Okay, okay.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.891
Eddy! Eddy! Eddy!

20:51.320 --> 20:54.005
What are those?
I'm not wearing them!

20:54.520 --> 20:58.081
Pats! Will you just let her
wear what she wants?

20:59.000 --> 21:00.570
Can I do Kate's hair?

21:00.640 --> 21:02.529
I'd love to give her ends a good tonging.

21:02.680 --> 21:03.681
Yes.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.411
She's going to love you, Lola.

21:06.480 --> 21:07.527
Why?

21:07.640 --> 21:08.971
'Cause you have what we all want.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.445
Eddy, look.

21:10.880 --> 21:13.645
Youth patch.
Absorb, absorb.

21:14.520 --> 21:15.681
Now, listen.

21:15.760 --> 21:17.524
You're coming
as my daughter,
so all you do...

21:17.760 --> 21:19.524
I'm not going to be man bait.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.364
You should be so lucky.

21:24.520 --> 21:25.885
What are you doing?

21:26.800 --> 21:29.531
I'm going. I want to go.

21:29.720 --> 21:31.006
Kate Moss will be there and Eddy said...

21:32.440 --> 21:33.680
What?

21:35.800 --> 21:38.690
Are you sexing
that little rodent downstairs,
darling?

21:39.560 --> 21:41.927
You know what?
Fine. Fuck it.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.925
Sorry. Fuck. Fuck!

21:44.400 --> 21:45.925
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.121
Fuck it!

21:48.560 --> 21:50.608
I am going out.
Do what you want.

21:50.680 --> 21:52.409
You can do what you want.

21:52.680 --> 21:54.409
Just don't do it to get at me.

21:54.600 --> 21:56.841
I ruined my life
by trying not to make
my mother happy.

21:56.960 --> 21:58.086
Don't do the same.

22:11.080 --> 22:13.048
You wearing Stella McCartney tonight, Eds?

22:13.400 --> 22:15.402
Uh, no, darling, no.

22:16.080 --> 22:18.606
She still won't let me in her shop.

22:21.760 --> 22:23.125
I'm here on the red carpet

22:23.200 --> 22:24.850
of the Huki Muki retrospective...

22:25.080 --> 22:27.082
with London's fashion glitterati.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.080
If you're not here,
then who the hell are you?

22:35.840 --> 22:37.126
You're singing tonight, Lulu.

22:37.200 --> 22:39.965
Yeah. It's going to be
a great crowd in there.
I'm excited.

22:40.120 --> 22:43.124
Jerry, you look ravishing.
What are you wearing?

22:43.600 --> 22:45.090
Well, Richard, I'm wearing a dress

22:45.160 --> 22:47.128
that was given to me by Chanel.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.489
As you can see, it's beautiful.

22:49.560 --> 22:51.210
I have lots of their dresses.

22:53.880 --> 22:56.008
Magda, is it possible...
No.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.650
Gwendoline? Gwendoline?

23:01.800 --> 23:03.131
How are you?

23:03.560 --> 23:04.607
You're really tall.
Well spotted.

23:05.800 --> 23:09.486
It's just I was
speaking to Lulu
and she's quite small.

23:09.640 --> 23:10.641
Great.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.166
Last ones, please.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.564
Good grief. Oh,
Christ, love,
we can see your bumhole.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.641
This way.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.489
Do you think Kate's already here?

23:18.560 --> 23:19.721
Hiya, hiya, hiya.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.042
Where's Kate?
Darling, just be cool.

23:22.240 --> 23:24.846
I am cool, darling.
I am cool.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.481
Oh, shit! Lulu.
Forgot to ring her.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.928
What'll I tell Lulu?

23:30.040 --> 23:32.247
Oi! You're not wearing
my clothes, are you?

23:32.680 --> 23:33.761
No, darling, no.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.047
This is all T. K. Maxx.
T. K. Maxx.

23:36.800 --> 23:38.245
I can't stand that woman.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.682
Let it go. Just breathe.

23:40.920 --> 23:41.921
Stella, darling.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.521
Is your father with you?
Is little Pauly with you?

23:45.840 --> 23:47.251
No.
Oh, that's a shame.

23:47.680 --> 23:49.523
I was hoping to have
a little catch-up with him.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.683
I haven't seen him
since 1969,
know what I mean?

23:53.000 --> 23:55.685
Ugh, God, and the world blamed Yoko.

23:56.080 --> 23:59.926
My shoes I just adore.
So comfortable.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.123
They're also made by Chanel.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.806
And are made of really soft leather.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.969
Huki Muki!

24:09.600 --> 24:10.965
I need to piss.

24:11.160 --> 24:12.207
Huki! Huki!

24:12.720 --> 24:16.088
Just a word, please!
Huki! Huki Muki!

24:17.840 --> 24:19.171
Sorry, Huki won't speak.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.564
Why do you think
there's been
a Huki Muki revival?

24:22.760 --> 24:26.651
It's about blobs.
Great big blobs of color.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.729
But why now?

24:28.960 --> 24:31.725
It's simply that
we're ready to
see it again.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.644
Thank you very much.

24:33.720 --> 24:35.563
Claudia Bing, an incredible woman.

24:35.760 --> 24:38.843
You know, Richard,
you really can't go wrong
with Chanel.

24:39.080 --> 24:40.605
I've been a big fan of Karl's

24:40.680 --> 24:43.729
for so many years,
and I love what he does.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.001
And glasses off.

24:45.760 --> 24:47.091
And glasses on again, darling.

24:47.720 --> 24:49.882
Ladies and gentlemen,
La Roux!

24:49.960 --> 24:51.769
He wants to know

24:52.120 --> 24:53.884
What it feels like

24:54.000 --> 24:55.684
Excuse me.

24:56.840 --> 24:58.729
Just looking for my mate, Kate.

24:58.800 --> 25:02.009
She wants to know What it feels like

25:02.240 --> 25:05.164
To settle down Settle down

25:06.160 --> 25:07.321
He's got the money

25:07.600 --> 25:10.683
Have you seen Kate Moss?
Just looking for Kate.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.291
He wants to pounce

25:12.680 --> 25:13.681
You're joking.

25:13.760 --> 25:14.727
He wants to pounce

25:14.800 --> 25:16.290
Never know ifhe's giving you up

25:16.600 --> 25:18.284
Are youjust not good enough

25:18.600 --> 25:20.762
Lulu, I thought you were singing tonight.

25:21.040 --> 25:22.371
That's what I was told.

25:22.760 --> 25:25.047
She's done this to me before as well.

25:25.200 --> 25:26.201
Oi!

25:26.280 --> 25:29.284
You. You told Lulu
this was her gig.

25:30.280 --> 25:32.169
You know what, darling?
It is, 'cause afterwards,

25:32.240 --> 25:35.289
they said you can sing
"Shout". Accapeli.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.640
I will bloody murder her.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.047
Has anyone seen Kate?
I'm supposed to meet her.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.888
Get me half a Bass in a straight glass,

25:46.960 --> 25:49.167
and something to eat,
but nothing with tentacles.

25:49.640 --> 25:51.210
And none of that dim sum bollocks.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.321
Get me a sandwich.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.125
He wants to know

25:58.200 --> 25:59.406
Kelly Hoppen.

25:59.640 --> 26:01.085
What's your take on all this color?

26:01.320 --> 26:03.288
To be honest, it's doing my head in.

26:03.640 --> 26:06.086
Eddy, little Kate is on the balcony.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.321
She's out there, darling!

26:07.800 --> 26:09.962
Oh, Lola, Lola, follow, follow.

26:17.160 --> 26:18.161
Sweetie!

26:18.840 --> 26:20.205
It's Brienne of Tarth...

26:20.320 --> 26:22.209
Lola, come here!

26:22.400 --> 26:24.084
Are you okay?

26:24.320 --> 26:27.290
I just have
this nightmare P. R.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.081
Oh, I got rid of mine.
Good for you.

26:30.320 --> 26:33.244
Eddy, I'm going to roll away the Hamm.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.691
All right, darling.

26:34.880 --> 26:35.881
I don't even know what they do.

26:35.960 --> 26:36.961
Who does?

26:37.360 --> 26:38.850
Oh, watch out.

26:39.080 --> 26:41.367
Hi, Jonny. Patsy. Stone.

26:41.840 --> 26:42.841
Patsy.

26:43.240 --> 26:45.368
Hamm. Jon. Hamm.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.365
Don't you remember me, Jonny?

26:48.000 --> 26:49.001
No.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.964
Jonny Jonny from the Big Apple

26:51.040 --> 26:53.441
needing a little taste
of the English rose?

26:55.320 --> 26:56.446
Oh, God.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.360
Yes, I do. I was fifteen.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.120
But you were a very
big fifteen, sweetheart.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.247
Oh, God.

27:02.440 --> 27:06.240
I want you to go over there
and talk to her casually.

27:06.440 --> 27:07.441
And then what?

27:07.880 --> 27:09.245
Then I'll come over and join you

27:09.320 --> 27:10.367
and she'll think I'm cool...

27:10.800 --> 27:13.201
and before you know it,
I'll be doing her P. R.

27:13.400 --> 27:14.811
That's the plan?
Yeah.

27:15.000 --> 27:16.126
Jesus.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.041
I can't believe you're still, uh...

27:21.040 --> 27:22.371
alive.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.290
Can I offer you
a taste now?
No.

27:24.480 --> 27:25.970
Oh, come on, Jonny, come on.

27:26.080 --> 27:27.411
No, thank you.

27:28.080 --> 27:31.368
You took my virginity.
Please leave me my...

27:32.160 --> 27:33.366
sanity.

27:33.440 --> 27:34.441
Good luck.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.010
Jonny. Hi, Kate, sweetie.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.486
Jonny? Jonny?

27:37.960 --> 27:40.042
Okay, go, go, go!

27:40.400 --> 27:42.767
Talk to her. Big me up.

27:51.040 --> 27:52.644
Yes, yes. Smoke, smoke.

27:54.040 --> 27:55.280
Smoke.

28:06.320 --> 28:08.209
Kate? Claudia Bing.

28:08.440 --> 28:09.885
Edina Monsoon!
Oh!

28:16.400 --> 28:17.401
Kate!

28:21.280 --> 28:22.520
Why did you do that?

28:22.600 --> 28:23.806
She fell.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.089
You pushed her.
No, she fell!

28:26.320 --> 28:27.970
I saw you!

28:28.200 --> 28:30.089
Kate Moss has been pushed!

28:33.200 --> 28:34.964
Kate! Kate!

28:35.200 --> 28:36.884
Kate Moss!

28:37.000 --> 28:39.571
Hold on. I'll go in!

28:40.000 --> 28:42.970
You are not going in!
Put your jacket back on!

28:43.240 --> 28:44.287
Eddy!

28:44.360 --> 28:46.169
She'll pop up!
It's only water!

28:47.480 --> 28:50.484
It's just water, why isn't she popping up?

28:51.160 --> 28:52.446
Why did you do this?

28:52.800 --> 28:54.802
I didn't do it!
She just fell!

28:55.040 --> 28:57.247
Eddy, this is my party!

29:00.240 --> 29:02.004
I have a limp and I don't know why.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.321
Get them all down.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.164
I don't want to see anything on camera.

29:05.360 --> 29:06.441
Right,
the only thing is...
Now!

29:07.480 --> 29:11.530
I fucking hate parties.
I fucking hate handbags!

29:13.520 --> 29:15.124
Me leg. Good Lord.

29:15.360 --> 29:16.771
Magda! Selfie!

29:16.840 --> 29:17.841
Fuck off!

29:18.120 --> 29:19.406
Get them off.

29:19.840 --> 29:23.287
That woman has always been out of control.

29:23.360 --> 29:24.850
Kate was trying to get away from her.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.327
I was shocked.
I saw it happen.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.526
She was pushed.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.282
Did I miss something?

29:32.520 --> 29:36.047
This is the scene
wherejust a few hours ago...

29:36.280 --> 29:38.521
celebrated international
model Kate Moss...

29:38.960 --> 29:43.488
fell or was pushed from
a balcony into the Thames.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.042
Since then, emergency services have been

29:46.120 --> 29:48.521
struggling to cope with the aftermath.

29:54.880 --> 29:56.564
It's my little toe.

29:56.640 --> 29:57.641
She fell off her shoe.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.085
Looking for Kate!

30:00.200 --> 30:03.568
Get back. One more dance.
Baby, please.

30:04.040 --> 30:07.010
I'm okay.
I didn't fall in the river.

30:44.200 --> 30:45.690
Shut up!
You shut up!

30:48.080 --> 30:50.287
How bad can this be?
I mean, you know.

30:50.480 --> 30:53.245
You have probably killed Kate Moss.

30:55.240 --> 30:56.480
Shit.

30:58.120 --> 30:59.451
Spoilt your night out?

31:00.360 --> 31:01.441
That doesn't matter.

31:02.280 --> 31:03.441
I shouldn't have let you go.

31:03.520 --> 31:05.363
I don't know what I was thinking.

31:06.120 --> 31:07.610
She'll be all right, won't she?

31:08.120 --> 31:10.282
Kate, she's waterproof.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.125
That's what we
always say about Kate,
she's waterproof.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.371
I demand to see your superior!

31:15.600 --> 31:17.250
That would be me.
Nick?

31:17.440 --> 31:18.680
This is Detective Inspector Nick...

31:18.760 --> 31:19.966
We know each other, thank you.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.041
God.

31:21.280 --> 31:22.281
Don't.

31:23.480 --> 31:26.324
Hello, hello?
Have they found Kate?

31:26.520 --> 31:28.284
No. The currents
are very strong.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.521
Only an outside chance...

31:29.960 --> 31:32.042
Thank you. She will
either have drowned

31:32.160 --> 31:34.970
or just be very, very wet.

31:35.960 --> 31:37.086
In the meantime,

31:37.160 --> 31:38.525
you're here for your own safety.

31:38.720 --> 31:41.610
There's a very
well-coordinated
lynch mob outside.

31:42.600 --> 31:43.601
What happens now?

31:44.000 --> 31:45.650
This doesn't change anything between us.

31:46.160 --> 31:47.491
No, about this.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.049
Oh. I have witnesses

31:50.120 --> 31:52.600
to say that your mother pushed her.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.081
No!

31:55.160 --> 31:56.286
I didn't want her to die.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.688
She needed her.
Loved her!

31:59.080 --> 32:00.206
We don't know that she's dead yet.

32:00.280 --> 32:01.566
Or that it's murder.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.169
Murder?
Thank you.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.166
Manslaughter charges might be brought.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.162
Sorry.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.440
Oh, God.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.368
Police continue to search the Thames

32:32.440 --> 32:34.568
after fashion icon Kate Moss....

32:35.040 --> 32:36.610
fell from a balcony.

32:40.440 --> 32:43.603
There is a real sense of
devastation. Local people...

32:43.800 --> 32:47.122
friends, eyewitnesses are in disbelief.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.806
They are reluctant
to leave the banks
of the Thames

32:49.880 --> 32:52.247
while any faint hope remains...

32:52.480 --> 32:54.369
of Kate Moss being found alive.

32:54.600 --> 32:57.729
We're expecting the police
to hold a news conference...

32:58.240 --> 32:59.651
to give us the latest information

32:59.720 --> 33:01.484
they have about the incident.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.409
Now back to the studio.

33:03.600 --> 33:05.170
Some breaking news...

33:05.240 --> 33:08.084
P. R. guru Edina Monsoon,
the woman at the heart...

33:08.360 --> 33:10.328
of the police investigation has returned

33:10.400 --> 33:12.084
to her West London home.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.722
Don't drive off
until I'm in the house!

33:17.400 --> 33:18.890
Oi! Oi!

33:23.240 --> 33:25.766
Stop hounding me!
I'm not an animal!

33:28.640 --> 33:30.529
She was, like, someone

33:30.600 --> 33:32.762
that I really looked up to.

33:33.160 --> 33:34.650
She wouldn't give a fuck what we think.

33:34.720 --> 33:35.881
No!

33:36.280 --> 33:37.566
Devastated.
I'm so confused.

33:37.760 --> 33:40.411
Is there really nothing else
happening in the world?

33:40.600 --> 33:41.647
Fashion is dead.

33:44.840 --> 33:47.161
Oh! Oh!

33:48.120 --> 33:49.406
OMG.
What, darling?

33:49.720 --> 33:50.767
You're trending on Twitter.

33:50.880 --> 33:51.881
Am I?

33:52.120 --> 33:53.645
You're a hashtag.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.603
Oh. Oh!

33:56.280 --> 33:58.203
Oh, no.

33:58.280 --> 34:00.123
Oh, no, this is horrible.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.409
Disgusting.

34:02.640 --> 34:04.642
Oh, they hate you!

34:04.760 --> 34:06.330
Who? Who?

34:06.480 --> 34:07.766
Oh, there she is.

34:08.120 --> 34:09.690
Here she is.

34:10.280 --> 34:11.804
The fat woman!

34:12.440 --> 34:14.123
Yeah, just do the toes.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.324
Your fat little toes?

34:17.560 --> 34:20.449
The fat little celebrity toes?

34:20.679 --> 34:23.159
Yeah, yeah.
Right.

34:24.159 --> 34:26.811
Fat woman kills thin woman.

34:27.239 --> 34:29.242
You don't know anything!
It was an accident!

34:29.440 --> 34:32.444
Nothing about you is an accident.

34:32.840 --> 34:34.330
May I suggest...

34:36.560 --> 34:37.561
Fat Pink?

34:39.560 --> 34:40.561
What are you doing?

34:40.719 --> 34:41.721
Oh, here we go.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.842
This is my therapy, sweetheart.

34:45.239 --> 34:48.449
When are you going to
just for one moment...

34:48.760 --> 34:51.730
take in the enormity of what has happened?

34:52.360 --> 34:54.840
When are you going to
stop rolling through life,

34:54.920 --> 34:57.161
wanting more and more?

34:57.480 --> 35:00.484
Look at this house.
Nobody needs
a house this big.

35:00.680 --> 35:01.841
I do.

35:02.360 --> 35:05.489
You see?
Even your house is fat.

35:05.720 --> 35:06.721
I'm on a diet.

35:06.920 --> 35:09.651
You're always on a diet, Mum,
but you're always fat.

35:09.720 --> 35:10.721
Mmm-hmm.

35:10.800 --> 35:12.450
Because you never stop eating!

35:12.520 --> 35:13.521
Mmm-hmm.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.691
Now will you please...

35:16.200 --> 35:19.886
just stop for one second
and look at what
you've done?

35:20.360 --> 35:21.646
Yes.

35:26.000 --> 35:29.004
Oh, I love that girl.

35:33.880 --> 35:36.406
Your death threats, m'lady.

35:36.920 --> 35:42.404
Like a bird on the wire

35:44.160 --> 35:48.563
Like a drunk in a midnight choir

35:49.400 --> 35:51.402
Everybody bloody hates you!

35:51.560 --> 35:53.324
Stupid bloody drunk!

35:53.520 --> 35:55.409
You mucky bitch.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.889
You filthy scunner!

35:59.000 --> 36:01.002
You make me sick.

36:01.360 --> 36:05.331
Like a worm on a hook

36:06.320 --> 36:08.084
I'm innocent.

36:08.240 --> 36:11.005
Patsy Stone.
But I am innocent.

36:11.240 --> 36:13.641
Excuse me, guys.
I'm the victim here.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.570
I'm Patsy Stone, but I am innocent.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.284
That's it, Patsy,
lovely. Thank you,
darling.

36:21.440 --> 36:22.441
Thanks.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.001
Thursday.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.130
Can you please shut up, darling?

36:41.200 --> 36:42.565
I'm trying to do my Mindlessness.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.645
I'm being trollied on Twitter.

36:47.400 --> 36:48.401
Oh.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.608
Everybody hates me.

36:52.040 --> 36:55.249
When I was coming
in earlier, a woman
screamed at me.

36:55.600 --> 36:57.045
What did she say?

36:57.240 --> 36:59.402
She told me I was a pariah.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.481
Do you know what a pariah is?

37:04.280 --> 37:05.964
It's a fish.

37:08.200 --> 37:09.486
That's right.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.687
Flash, flash, flash.
Flash for Patsy.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.082
Patsy, flash, flash, flash.

37:15.320 --> 37:16.481
Ugh, Eddy.

37:18.640 --> 37:20.085
You killed Kate Moss!

37:20.160 --> 37:22.288
I've lost my job because of you!

37:22.600 --> 37:25.080
And now I am nothing as well.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.607
It's from Stella McCartney.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.003
How many "Om's" have I given you?

37:59.080 --> 38:01.082
How much money?

38:01.280 --> 38:03.044
Where is my enlightenment?

38:03.200 --> 38:04.690
Where is my nirvana,

38:05.000 --> 38:08.083
you stupid, blue, buggering Buddha!

38:16.400 --> 38:18.209
Om...

38:20.400 --> 38:22.129
Om...

38:22.600 --> 38:25.001
Ba-ding-ding-ding-ding,
cha...

38:25.480 --> 38:27.642
Om...

38:28.640 --> 38:32.008
Ba-ring-ding-ding-
ding-ding-cha...

38:32.720 --> 38:34.529
Om...

38:38.120 --> 38:40.122
Oh.

38:48.680 --> 38:50.682
Sorry you lost your job, darling.

38:51.520 --> 38:52.681
You're not nothing.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.331
Cheers, thanks a lot.

39:00.320 --> 39:02.561
It's the first thing
I've ever had from Stella.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.081
Oh, Eddy.

39:04.240 --> 39:07.164
So the little scrap drowned.
People will forget that.

39:07.280 --> 39:09.123
They've forgotten a lot worse.

39:09.360 --> 39:11.601
I mean, look at lovely Hugh.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.446
He unzipped his chinos for
a prossie blowjob

39:14.520 --> 39:15.601
and we forgave him.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.683
In fact, I think
we loved him a little bit
more after that.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.769
She's probably popped up
somewhere, hasn't she?

39:24.040 --> 39:26.042
Confused and shivering.

39:26.240 --> 39:30.802
Poor little tiny wet Katie,
flapping about in the mud.

39:31.160 --> 39:33.447
Washed up on the Isle of Dogs.

39:36.440 --> 39:37.726
I mean, Eddy...

39:38.720 --> 39:40.449
things float.

39:40.520 --> 39:41.521
Yeah.

39:41.720 --> 39:45.327
Yeah, things drift, and they float.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.330
Why don't those
idiots float
something down the river?

39:49.400 --> 39:50.401
Eddy...

39:51.200 --> 39:53.726
if you want
something done,
you've got to do it yourself.

39:54.480 --> 39:55.641
Yeah.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.641
It's the right place and the right time.

40:05.200 --> 40:07.202
What for?
Shut up.

40:12.760 --> 40:13.761
Are you ready, Pats?

40:15.200 --> 40:16.201
Ready, Eddy.
Ready for what?

40:16.720 --> 40:17.721
Ah.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.324
Go, drift.

40:29.200 --> 40:30.531
Bubble?

40:30.840 --> 40:31.841
Bubble!

40:32.520 --> 40:34.682
Where is she, Ed?
I don't know. Bubble?

40:34.840 --> 40:36.330
She swims too fast.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.647
There she is. Go forward!
What is she doing?

40:38.840 --> 40:39.841
Bubble!

40:40.160 --> 40:41.286
Fish her out, the little insect.

40:41.360 --> 40:42.441
Bubble!

40:47.240 --> 40:48.526
Bubble?

40:48.680 --> 40:50.648
Darling, she fell off.

40:51.640 --> 40:52.801
Eddy.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.571
It's okay, no one saw.

40:54.800 --> 40:56.370
But, Eddy, they'll find her!

40:56.440 --> 40:58.681
Then just go, go, go!

41:01.120 --> 41:03.361
Go, darling, go, go, go.

41:11.120 --> 41:12.645
Oh, that's great, isn't it?

41:12.720 --> 41:14.370
Now I've killed two people!

41:14.440 --> 41:15.441
Oh!

41:15.560 --> 41:16.561
Come on!

41:17.160 --> 41:19.288
Eddy, we've got to
get away.
We've got to go now.

41:19.560 --> 41:21.324
But where?
I can't leave the country.

41:21.400 --> 41:23.402
I'm a marked woman.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.564
We could go north.
North?

41:25.800 --> 41:27.290
What, south?

41:27.400 --> 41:29.084
You know what we need.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.850
We need money.

41:34.560 --> 41:36.847
Darling, darling.
Listen.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.207
When this is actually over,

41:40.280 --> 41:42.851
and it will actually be
over one day, darling...

41:43.600 --> 41:46.604
will you please just remind me...

41:47.520 --> 41:50.603
to go back for the boots
I just saw
in Westwood window.

41:55.720 --> 41:56.846
Eddy?

41:57.600 --> 41:58.886
What is this?

41:58.960 --> 42:00.849
Darling, it's a onesie.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.251
Mmm-hmm.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.725
I've got some pills.

42:05.200 --> 42:06.531
Pills, pills, pills.

42:06.840 --> 42:09.320
I've got some little blue
ones, little pink ones.

42:09.600 --> 42:11.648
That little blue one.
What's that?

42:12.320 --> 42:13.321
It's a button.

42:18.400 --> 42:21.290
Maybe I should just resign
myself to my fate, darling.

42:22.640 --> 42:25.564
I mean, I can't redecorate
my way out of this one,
can I?

42:25.640 --> 42:27.642
You bitch!

42:28.760 --> 42:30.524
Eddy, we've got to escape.

42:30.600 --> 42:32.364
We've got to get out of the country.

42:32.560 --> 42:33.891
I have no money.

42:33.960 --> 42:36.440
Why didn't you marry
some of those rich men
you slept with?

42:36.640 --> 42:37.641
That wasn't the point.

42:38.240 --> 42:39.526
There must be someone.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.489
There must be someone, darling.

42:41.760 --> 42:45.321
Think. We've got to make
a serious plan. Think!

42:49.480 --> 42:50.891
We could try a bong.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.365
I've got a bong.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.809
Everyone used to die young
in old cavemen
historical times.

43:02.880 --> 43:04.689
They didn't reach the age of 30.

43:04.840 --> 43:07.844
That's why now,
everyone young
just wants to go so fast.

43:08.240 --> 43:10.402
But at our age, you're lost, because...

43:11.480 --> 43:12.720
we should all be dead.

43:12.920 --> 43:15.526
Shouldn't we, darling?
No, Eddy, no.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.490
It's very good to die young.

43:17.680 --> 43:19.921
It is good to go young.

43:20.560 --> 43:21.561
Yeah.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.289
Oh, no, it's ash.

43:30.680 --> 43:32.523
Oh.

43:32.600 --> 43:33.761
Oh...

43:33.880 --> 43:34.961
Eddy, there was Charlie.

43:35.360 --> 43:36.441
Who's Charlie?

43:36.520 --> 43:39.285
Charlie Douglas.
He had an enormous yacht.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.731
Ah, he never married.

43:44.880 --> 43:47.042
He said I was the only girl
he would ever marry.

43:47.320 --> 43:48.970
He said he would wait for me.

43:49.400 --> 43:50.890
Oh...
We had some good times.

43:50.960 --> 43:52.962
We had good times and he was rich!

43:54.240 --> 43:55.241
He was very rich!

43:58.840 --> 44:00.330
Eddy?
Yeah.

44:00.560 --> 44:02.961
Saffy's little birth blob has money.

44:05.440 --> 44:09.001
Darling. We need Lola.
We need to take Lola.

44:10.400 --> 44:11.640
Yeah, we need Lola.

44:11.840 --> 44:14.571
I can hear everything
you're saying, you know.

44:15.600 --> 44:16.840
Everything.

44:16.920 --> 44:19.491
Are you looking for my money
so you can go find Charlie?

44:19.560 --> 44:22.006
No, no, no, darling.
No, no.

44:22.440 --> 44:25.330
Yes! Give us
your credit cards
and you won't get hurt!

44:25.520 --> 44:26.521
Why should I?

44:26.760 --> 44:27.807
Oh. Oh...

44:27.880 --> 44:31.327
Because, darling,
now you listen to me,
all right?

44:31.600 --> 44:33.329
I've messed up, I know that,

44:33.440 --> 44:35.488
but that will happen to anybody...

44:35.760 --> 44:36.886
who really lives life,

44:36.960 --> 44:39.770
who really lives life, darling.

44:40.000 --> 44:42.367
And I now know who my friends are.

44:42.480 --> 44:45.450
Husbands, they come and go,
but my friend has stayed.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.601
Why does she stay?

44:48.600 --> 44:50.045
Because it's bloody good fun.

44:50.760 --> 44:51.886
We have fun.

44:52.360 --> 44:54.931
Good fun, darling.
And you know what?

44:55.360 --> 44:59.046
There's so many great times
out there waiting for us.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.482
And I don't want to miss them.

45:01.680 --> 45:03.045
We don't want to miss them, do we?

45:03.120 --> 45:04.963
Or would you rather stay here?

45:05.360 --> 45:08.364
You know, with Mum.
Dull old Mum.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.362
Or come with us, sweetheart.

45:11.920 --> 45:14.651
Come with us. For fun.

45:16.800 --> 45:18.450
Fine.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.006
You'll need more than the card.

45:20.080 --> 45:22.845
We can't just walk out of
the house in broad daylight.

45:23.040 --> 45:26.647
Yeah, of course.
We need help. More help.

45:26.840 --> 45:28.729
Who else would be
stupid enough
to help you two?

45:28.800 --> 45:29.801
Huh.

45:30.600 --> 45:32.602
Oh.

45:35.160 --> 45:37.481
So what is Patsy's plan?

45:37.720 --> 45:38.881
Just do what I do.

45:39.080 --> 45:42.084
We sneak into the house
looking perfectly normal.

45:42.400 --> 45:44.767
It'll be a nightmare
with all the paparazzi.

45:45.520 --> 45:48.330
Excuse me! No!
No photographs!

45:48.840 --> 45:50.842
No one's taking any photos.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.888
It's as if they didn't know who we are.

45:52.960 --> 45:54.962
Missed a
perfect opportunity. Get in.

45:55.440 --> 45:56.851
No photos, no photos.

45:57.080 --> 45:58.570
Come on, dear.

45:59.440 --> 46:01.363
Police are urging the crowd to move on.

46:01.560 --> 46:03.847
The flowers, offerings
of Hunter Wellingtons...

46:04.000 --> 46:06.207
and bottles of Sauvignon Blanc

46:06.440 --> 46:07.885
are proving a hazard to shipping.

46:08.080 --> 46:10.447
Oh, for God's sake, turn it off.

46:11.560 --> 46:15.849
We can't, darling.
We're drunk and have
eaten too many drugs.

46:16.120 --> 46:17.770
As per usual.

46:21.560 --> 46:22.686
Where's Mum?

46:26.560 --> 46:27.891
What has happened to Kate Moss?

46:27.960 --> 46:31.123
Where is she?
What in the world
is going on?

46:39.480 --> 46:41.482
Quick, quick.
Almost there.

46:42.000 --> 46:44.731
Get into this taxi
where we're going nowhere.

46:44.920 --> 46:45.921
What took you so long?

46:46.120 --> 46:47.246
Hurry up, Fleur.

46:47.400 --> 46:48.481
It's these bloody shoes.

46:48.680 --> 46:50.045
All right, taxi, drive.

46:50.480 --> 46:51.720
Drive, drive!

46:53.880 --> 46:54.961
Welcome back.

46:55.080 --> 46:58.163
So, Lily, can you tell us
how you're feeling
about Kate?

46:58.600 --> 47:00.125
Well...
Put it into words.

47:00.920 --> 47:02.604
Well, I...
Sad.

47:02.920 --> 47:04.684
I didn't actually know her that well.

47:04.800 --> 47:06.609
You're devastated.

47:06.920 --> 47:07.921
I...

47:08.000 --> 47:10.480
Heartbroken.
Thank you so much.

47:10.760 --> 47:13.764
Your feelings are shared
by a nation still in shock.

47:18.600 --> 47:20.523
How's your mother holding up?

47:21.640 --> 47:24.166
It seems to be
taking its toll...
facially.

47:25.640 --> 47:27.165
I'm going to wake Lola up.

47:27.280 --> 47:28.930
I can't believe she slept this long.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.963
Let her sleep.
She's a grownup.

47:31.200 --> 47:33.043
She's thirteen.

47:44.080 --> 47:46.651
I want you to know something.

47:48.800 --> 47:51.087
I'm sorry I went out that night.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.086
I, uh...

47:57.080 --> 47:59.082
should have stayed with you.

48:00.080 --> 48:04.563
Then perhaps you wouldn't
have got caught up
in all this mess.

48:13.960 --> 48:15.564
I love you.

48:22.560 --> 48:26.007
Lola's gone. She's gone!
She must have gone
with them!

48:27.680 --> 48:29.250
Tell me where they've gone.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.525
Tell me!

48:31.640 --> 48:33.244
Whoa, whoa. Calm down.

48:33.720 --> 48:34.846
Where have they gone?

48:35.040 --> 48:36.041
We don't know.

48:36.160 --> 48:37.161
We weren't told.

48:37.600 --> 48:40.251
A girl has only
one confidante
and mum's the word.

48:40.320 --> 48:43.722
Oh, her hairdresser,
Christopher. Oh!

48:44.000 --> 48:45.240
Judas.

48:45.680 --> 48:46.886
I knew she spoke to him

48:46.960 --> 48:48.928
because she canceled her next appointment.

48:49.120 --> 48:50.281
Don't panic.

48:50.360 --> 48:53.125
It's only a problem
if they've left the country.

48:57.040 --> 48:58.371
Welcome to Budget.

48:58.720 --> 49:01.724
Where the only tossers
are our baggage handlers.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.280
How are you? Hi.

49:03.680 --> 49:04.966
Morning.
Oh, shut up.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.360
Where we wing it.

49:06.720 --> 49:08.370
Welcome on-board
Budget Airlines.

49:08.640 --> 49:10.768
This is flight BD1 15 to Nice.

49:11.040 --> 49:13.361
Where is first class?
Down the back?

49:13.720 --> 49:15.370
Oh...

49:15.760 --> 49:17.285
There is no first class.

49:17.360 --> 49:20.045
It's just first ass on any available seat.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.647
We are three.
There's only two seats.

49:22.840 --> 49:25.844
The middle one isn't a seat,
it's where you put your bag.

49:26.040 --> 49:29.328
Oh, no, they're all seats.
Uh, you put your bags up top.

49:30.880 --> 49:31.881
Oh, God.

49:32.320 --> 49:33.321
Uh...

49:33.760 --> 49:37.321
I don't put the bags up.
I'm the designated DNB.

49:39.240 --> 49:40.401
"Do Nothing Bitch."

49:44.000 --> 49:45.240
- Thank you.
- Ow!

49:46.480 --> 49:48.084
Sandwich. Heads up.

49:48.320 --> 49:50.084
Can we get free nuts
and drinks from the bitch?

49:50.240 --> 49:53.244
Oi, waitress?
We want our complimentary
drinks and nuts.

49:53.640 --> 49:58.089
Oh, you have to prepay
for all the snacks
and beverages.

49:58.320 --> 50:01.688
Just get your credit card,
slip it through your slot.

50:01.920 --> 50:04.241
Uh, ma'am, you'll have to take your seat.

50:04.680 --> 50:05.920
I need a piss.

50:06.120 --> 50:07.246
It'll have to wait.

50:09.240 --> 50:10.765
I've started.

50:15.800 --> 50:18.690
I hate how you have to
be nice to transgendered
people now.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.769
Just reach around
and get that
lady's red wine.

50:20.840 --> 50:22.001
No.

50:28.760 --> 50:30.967
Oi! Drop the fag, hag!

50:31.280 --> 50:32.725
What is your problem?

50:33.240 --> 50:34.401
You!

50:45.080 --> 50:49.290
Cheers.
Don't get that
on British Airways.

51:02.480 --> 51:03.481
Whoo-hoo!

51:04.280 --> 51:05.281
We did it, Pats!

51:05.440 --> 51:07.408
Oh, Eddy, we did it!

51:07.480 --> 51:08.845
We're free, free!

51:09.160 --> 51:10.525
We can breathe!

51:10.600 --> 51:11.726
Breathe!

51:12.320 --> 51:14.209
We're going to join the jet set.

51:14.400 --> 51:15.401
The jet set.

51:15.840 --> 51:17.842
So you're going to marry this Charlie?

51:18.000 --> 51:19.843
She's going to marry him,

51:19.920 --> 51:21.684
then he's going to die
and we'll get all the money.

51:22.840 --> 51:24.080
How old is he?

51:24.160 --> 51:25.400
Oh, he's ancient.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.524
He's old.
He's like on death's door.

51:28.400 --> 51:30.129
Actually, he's the same age as me.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.002
We need more champagne, darling.

51:35.200 --> 51:36.361
No, it's nearly over its limit.

51:36.440 --> 51:37.441
What does that mean?

51:37.840 --> 51:40.366
It means we need
Charlie's big bucks,
darling,

51:40.440 --> 51:42.363
if we're ever going to live the dream.

51:42.760 --> 51:45.331
Oh, Eddy, the dream.
The dream, darling.

51:46.840 --> 51:50.367
But where do you go to my lovely

51:50.760 --> 51:53.366
When you're alone in your bed

51:55.040 --> 51:58.044
Tell me the thoughts that surround you

51:58.880 --> 52:01.247
I want to look inside your head, yes, I do

52:11.360 --> 52:14.125
I need to buy champagne.
What's that in French?

52:14.200 --> 52:16.009
Champignons,
champignons.

52:16.120 --> 52:17.884
We need to get out of these clothes.

52:18.040 --> 52:19.849
It's all right, darling.
No one knows us here.

52:19.920 --> 52:21.285
They're just so horrible.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.366
Oh, Eddy?

52:24.400 --> 52:26.084
Oh.

52:27.160 --> 52:28.491
Buongiorno!

52:33.040 --> 52:35.281
Baby Bunton, Pats.
Baby Bunton.

52:35.360 --> 52:36.361
Shit.

52:36.840 --> 52:38.365
Eddy, Eddy.

52:49.520 --> 52:52.251
Why can't we go anywhere
without knowing someone?

52:52.520 --> 52:54.090
She didn't see us.

52:54.960 --> 52:56.849
I think I just saw Edina Monsoon.

52:56.920 --> 52:57.967
Really?

52:58.160 --> 53:01.164
Unless you've seen
a mannequin that fat before.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.851
Hiya. You okay?

53:15.520 --> 53:18.410
I've put you into hot yoga after this.

53:18.480 --> 53:20.528
You do it
in an actual oven. Ooh!

53:21.600 --> 53:23.329
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

53:23.400 --> 53:26.131
Just don't think about Edina Monsoon.

53:26.880 --> 53:28.245
Oh, thanks.

53:30.880 --> 53:32.291
It's Emma Bunton.

53:32.560 --> 53:34.289
What? Emma Bunton?

53:36.440 --> 53:38.283
No. Edina?

53:38.560 --> 53:40.005
She's where?

53:40.200 --> 53:41.361
Did you call the police?

53:41.560 --> 53:43.847
Yes. And I'm going
over there to make sure

53:43.920 --> 53:45.331
the police do their job!

53:45.480 --> 53:47.482
Her P.A. has a house
near Cannes.

53:47.880 --> 53:50.167
Bubble has a house there?
Yeah.

53:50.360 --> 53:51.646
You talked to her?

53:52.040 --> 53:54.361
Yeah. She's had
a terrible time.

53:54.440 --> 53:56.568
It's been quite a saga.

53:57.440 --> 53:59.169
Nothing.

54:00.640 --> 54:02.165
What's that?

54:05.040 --> 54:07.327
That's nice. eBay?

54:07.480 --> 54:08.481
Oi!

54:09.040 --> 54:11.168
Oi, you!

54:12.480 --> 54:15.006
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

54:16.040 --> 54:18.008
Have you been in the water long?

54:18.160 --> 54:20.606
All bloody night.
Did you jump?

54:21.040 --> 54:24.362
Did I, buggery.
I was pushed.

54:26.240 --> 54:29.608
Lola won't answer my calls
and I've tried every number
for Christopher.

54:29.680 --> 54:31.648
I'll have to look for him.

54:31.800 --> 54:33.086
At least she's with your mother.

54:33.760 --> 54:34.761
And Patsy.

54:35.840 --> 54:37.126
My daughter is with Patsy.

54:37.320 --> 54:38.401
I'll come with you.

54:38.680 --> 54:40.045
Edina must be back
in 3 days for
the primary hearing.

54:40.240 --> 54:43.050
I don't care about her.
No, I'm sorry.

54:43.240 --> 54:45.004
Let me.
No!

54:45.680 --> 54:47.250
I'm better on my own.

54:59.880 --> 55:03.248
Shoot that poison arrow
to my heart, heart, heart

55:03.760 --> 55:05.364
Shoot that poison arrow to my heart

55:05.800 --> 55:07.245
Oh, hello. I know you.

55:07.400 --> 55:10.051
My mother used to bring me
here as a child.

55:11.160 --> 55:14.448
Shoot that poison arrow
to my heart, heart, heart

55:15.080 --> 55:16.730
Shoot that poison arrow

55:18.880 --> 55:20.928
Shoot that poison arrow

55:23.840 --> 55:26.969
Christopher, I know you're
here. I just saw you.

55:29.720 --> 55:31.768
My daughter's gone missing

55:31.840 --> 55:33.365
and I think you know where she's gone.

55:33.760 --> 55:35.250
Clear off, you little wet wipe!

55:38.080 --> 55:39.844
Just sing something.

55:39.920 --> 55:42.082
That'll quieten them down.

55:42.840 --> 55:45.081
Get off, you little bitch troll!

55:49.840 --> 55:52.081
I learned the truth at seventeen

55:52.360 --> 55:55.807
That love was meant for beauty queens

55:56.760 --> 56:00.048
And high school girls
with clear-skinned smiles

56:00.360 --> 56:03.887
Who married young and then retired

56:07.320 --> 56:11.245
And those of us with ravaged faces

56:12.080 --> 56:14.970
Lacking in the social graces

56:15.320 --> 56:18.767
Desperately remained at home

56:18.960 --> 56:22.123
lnventing lovers on the phone

56:22.800 --> 56:26.122
Who called to say "Come dance with me"

56:27.400 --> 56:30.483
And murmured vague obscenities

56:31.400 --> 56:35.962
It isn't all it seems at seventeen

56:40.440 --> 56:42.124
So who is this Charles?

56:42.320 --> 56:44.448
Oh, just an old scrotum Patsy knows.

56:44.520 --> 56:45.931
More money than marbles.

56:46.160 --> 56:48.049
Charles was rather superb, actually.

56:48.240 --> 56:51.244
Back when the
South of France
was really something...

56:51.440 --> 56:52.771
God created woman

56:52.840 --> 56:54.922
and Brigitte Bardot
was just out of nappies.

56:55.120 --> 56:57.122
She's back in 'em now.

56:57.320 --> 56:59.322
What did Charles do?
Films.

56:59.520 --> 57:02.000
What kind?
Art films.

57:05.400 --> 57:06.561
Oh, porn!

57:08.920 --> 57:10.490
Well, no.
For connoisseurs...

57:10.840 --> 57:11.921
Gentlemen.

57:12.040 --> 57:13.121
Gentlesseurs.

57:13.360 --> 57:14.327
If you don't find him?

57:14.400 --> 57:15.925
This is my old hunting ground.

57:16.160 --> 57:18.162
Plenty of prey out there.

57:18.360 --> 57:20.283
And they won't need
beaters to flush 'em out

57:20.360 --> 57:22.442
once they sniff me up the Croisette.

57:24.400 --> 57:27.165
So the plan is, we start
at Violet's party, right?

57:27.360 --> 57:29.089
The old guys will be there.

57:29.280 --> 57:30.406
My mother doesn't know anything

57:30.480 --> 57:31.891
and Violet won't care.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.889
In the South of France,
everyone's a criminal!

57:35.080 --> 57:36.206
Plenty of cleavage, Eddy.

57:36.400 --> 57:37.447
Yes, darling.
I'm wearing this.

57:37.520 --> 57:38.885
But not those shoes.

57:39.080 --> 57:40.889
Those shoes, darling.
Not those shoes.

57:41.160 --> 57:42.207
But I like these shoes.

57:42.360 --> 57:43.407
They make you hobble.

57:43.840 --> 57:47.401
I'm wearing them anyway.
I have thin ankles.

57:48.400 --> 57:52.086
We all play the game
and when we dare

57:52.480 --> 57:56.007
We cheat ourselves at solitaire

57:56.360 --> 57:59.284
lnventing lovers on the phone

57:59.840 --> 58:00.807
Oh, my God.

58:00.880 --> 58:03.008
What that woman has done to you.

58:04.120 --> 58:05.121
You have to tell me where she is.

58:05.200 --> 58:06.201
Do you know?

58:07.000 --> 58:09.128
Cannes.
Cannes in France.
Thank you.

58:09.440 --> 58:10.441
And, hey.

58:11.240 --> 58:12.241
Make your own kind of music.

58:20.360 --> 58:21.361
Merci.

58:21.440 --> 58:23.124
You're very lucky at this.

58:23.320 --> 58:24.560
No, not luck.

58:24.640 --> 58:27.086
It's just that I play a bad hand well.

58:27.240 --> 58:28.890
Don't we all?

58:29.120 --> 58:30.531
Keep behind us.

58:30.600 --> 58:32.090
Stay behind.
Don't come with us.

58:32.240 --> 58:33.526
This is it, Eddy.

58:35.160 --> 58:37.242
I'm looking good, I'm looking...

58:39.600 --> 58:42.285
Oh, Eddy, look how young we are.

58:43.040 --> 58:44.565
Look at the sad shoes.

58:44.920 --> 58:46.331
It's all leopard print and liver spots.

58:46.400 --> 58:47.970
It's like old age camouflage.

58:48.160 --> 58:50.049
I smell formaldehyde.

58:50.240 --> 58:52.242
What on earth are you doing here?

58:52.440 --> 58:53.566
Mrs. M.

58:53.960 --> 58:55.371
Just looking for the party.

58:55.560 --> 58:56.561
Well, this is it.

58:57.640 --> 58:59.005
Yoo-hoo!

58:59.280 --> 59:00.566
Christ, is that Violet?

59:00.960 --> 59:03.247
What is this,
some late-life lesbo party?

59:03.320 --> 59:04.481
Where are the men?

59:04.920 --> 59:06.285
They're on the terrace, dear.

59:06.600 --> 59:10.047
We have to make do
with cards
and a little dancing.

59:11.040 --> 59:12.610
It's quite nice, actually.

59:14.160 --> 59:16.401
Terrace, terrace, terrace.

59:16.480 --> 59:17.527
Yeah. Yeah.

59:17.600 --> 59:21.321
You stay here
with the old ones.
We're off.

59:21.920 --> 59:24.491
Ooh, look, Pats,
not hobbling,
not hobbling.

59:32.160 --> 59:34.083
Ah, this is more like it, Eds.

59:34.280 --> 59:36.248
This is our kind of party, darling.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.288
We fit in here.

59:39.000 --> 59:40.286
Hey, Monty.
How's things?

59:40.480 --> 59:42.642
No ex-wives
allowed here.

59:43.080 --> 59:45.082
You need some help, old ladies?

59:46.960 --> 59:49.088
The place is full of weird babies.

59:49.280 --> 59:51.169
Little stretched fetus faces.

59:51.320 --> 59:52.560
Patsy!

59:52.960 --> 59:53.961
Patsy!

59:54.520 --> 59:56.648
It's Charlie. Stay here.
Jesus.

59:57.440 --> 01:00:00.091
My God!
I'd know those tits
anywhere!

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.646
Patsy!

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.248
Oh, Charles, darling.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.363
What are you doing here, Patricia?

01:00:08.560 --> 01:00:10.562
Charles, darling, looking for you.

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.165
Oh.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.331
Still got the yacht, Charlie?

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.240
I've got a big one.

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.005
The trouble is the girls

01:00:18.080 --> 01:00:20.321
all want their own cabins these days.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.010
Oh, Charlie, do you remember the old days?

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:28.570
You... Fiona
and that Kristel wench.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.041
No, Charlie. I meant us.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:34.566
Black Emanuelle meets Hitler.

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:37.248
I loved that film!

01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.444
Do you remember waking up together

01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:42.682
in hot, sweet Saint-Tropez?

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.681
Walking across the duckboards
down to the fairy blue sea?

01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.923
Oh, I miss those times.

01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.250
So do I, Charlie.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.402
But you know what I really miss?

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.090
Yes, Charles.

01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.321
Pubic hair.

01:00:57.400 --> 01:00:58.561
I'm sick of those Brazilians...

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:02.567
those Hollywoods.
So bald, so boring.

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:05.242
I had a full beard in those days.

01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.404
But I suppose you are what you eat.

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.246
But Charlie, Charlie, look at me.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:16.291
Remember you said
you would only
ever marry me?

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.760
Uh, I might have said that.

01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.322
Well, Charles, I'm ready.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.764
My answer is yes.

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.647
Steady on, Patsy, steady on.

01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:29.451
As you can see,
we're very well
catered for here.

01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:34.324
Charlie, you always said I was the one.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.441
I think he's tired of you now.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.610
Isn't she terrific looking?

01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:42.610
Charlie, she's a gold digger.

01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.605
I'm a gold mine.

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:51.120
Oh, by the way,
steer clear of the Jacuzzi.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.483
It's a smoothie of old sperm.

01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.481
Ciao.

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:03.686
Hmm?

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.480
Bastard.

01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:15.246
No luck?

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.486
No.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.203
You see, dear, we're all too old now.

01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.406
Oh, shut up.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:23.290
Come on, Eddy!
It's my birthday.

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:25.249
Come on, come on.

01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.685
Oh!

01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:32.321
Enjoying yourself?

01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:33.521
No.

01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:40.809
No, I'm young!
I'm still young.
I'm not old.

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.402
I'm not old.
I'm still young.

01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:45.489
Because 60 is the new 40!

01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:48.160
Sixty is the new 40!

01:02:48.360 --> 01:02:50.522
No! Not the sad feet!

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.441
Oh, ow! Ow.

01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:58.521
Careful!

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:01.326
With your reputation
for galumphing into people,

01:03:01.400 --> 01:03:03.289
we don't want you to
trip over the Duchess.

01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:06.247
What is that?

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.526
She's the Dowager Baroness

01:03:07.600 --> 01:03:11.400
Lubliana Thysen von Rothschild und Muck.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.165
Pats, Pats, Pats, Pats, Pats.

01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.845
That is the richest woman in the world.

01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:26.845
Darling, that...

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.847
is the richest woman in the world!

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.649
No, Eddy, no, no, Eddy, no!

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.569
Yes, yes, yes.
Just come on.

01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.601
Oi! Where are
you two off to?

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:39.926
Laundry. You come, too.

01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:46.121
Reports from a source
close to the investigation

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.521
suggest Edina Monsoon
may have fled the country.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:49.601
For you.
Ooh.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.401
Gran?

01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:56.602
Oh, hello, Saffy.
Is Mum there?

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.604
Yes, your mother and Patsy are here.

01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:01.484
What about Lola?

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:03.091
Is she with them?

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.611
Well, she was, dear.

01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:08.569
Oh, my goodness. I must go.
Shirley Bassey is arriving...

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.603
any minute now.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:20.728
The minute you walked in thejoint

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.683
I could see you were a man of distinction

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:25.847
A real big spender

01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:27.291
Very nice.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:30.250
Good lookin', so refined

01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:33.808
Say,
wouldn't you like to know
what's goin' on in my mind?

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:35.889
So let me get right to the point

01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:39.286
I don't pop my cork for every man I see

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.880
May we join you?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.240
Who are you?

01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.404
I am Edina.

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:47.651
May I introduce my brother Pat?

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.967
Spend a little time with me

01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:53.406
Stone. Pat Stone.

01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:58.488
Do you know who I am?

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.246
Dowager Baroness Lubliana

01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:03.800
Thysen von Rothschild und Muck.

01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:07.523
So you're not partying
with all the other men?

01:05:07.720 --> 01:05:09.324
No, he likes older women.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:11.488
Not those girls.

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:18.287
We want a proper shuffle,
no fuzzing the cards.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:23.691
With me

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:33.447
Spring was never waiting for us, boy

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:36.490
It ran one step ahead

01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:38.642
As we followed in the dance

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:47.890
Between the parted pages and were pressed

01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:52.409
ln love's hot fevered iron
like a striped...

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.490
French.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.490
Pat Stone.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:13.881
Yeah.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.041
Yeah.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:17.801
Oui.

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:19.405
Okay.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:31.966
Yes, absolutely.

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:35.921
Now.

01:06:36.360 --> 01:06:37.361
Oh!

01:06:43.520 --> 01:06:46.046
Oh, what a rainbow world we live in.

01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:00.764
Till death do you part,
till death do you part.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:02.763
How long do you think it will be?

01:07:02.920 --> 01:07:05.651
Let Lubey have her moment.
Come on, sweetie, be cool.

01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:07.126
My darling Pat.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.010
You feeling all right?

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:14.643
MacArthur's Park is melting in the dark

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.805
All the sweet green icing flowing down

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.048
Still got it, hasn't it, the Riviera?

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.566
Yeah, it's still got it.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.686
Where are we going?

01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.008
The Grand-Hotel
Du Cap-Ferrat.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.966
Oh, Eddy,
the six finest words
in the English language.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:38.971
Are we booked in?

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:41.885
No need, it's mine.
I own it.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.127
I'm so happy.
Are you?

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.449
Tremendously happy.

01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.848
You and I are married.

01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:08.726
So...

01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:12.610
so...

01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:14.681
happy?

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.604
Tremendously.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.129
Now it's late, darling.
Bed beckons.

01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:24.604
Does it? Um, another drink?
Perhaps some nibbles?

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.604
I'm tired.

01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.849
Oh, I'm tired, too.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.127
Would you mind if I retired?

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:33.042
Stay and drink with your sister.

01:08:33.479 --> 01:08:35.687
I don't mind.
Enjoy the evening.

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.488
And thank you.

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:41.841
I may be...

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.126
the richest woman in the world,

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:47.171
but also sometimes the loneliest.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.529
Oh, Lubey.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:51.370
Am I interrupting something?
No, darling.

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:55.727
Au revoir.

01:09:01.319 --> 01:09:02.401
Oh, Eddy.

01:09:03.319 --> 01:09:05.243
Little Lubey, Eds.
Mmm.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.724
is a darling.

01:09:08.479 --> 01:09:10.720
Wasabi nut, wasabi.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.649
Thank you, darling.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:20.524
How are you feeling?

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.081
Tremendously happy.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.130
What if they've found Bubble?

01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:30.926
Darling, don't
think about it.
They can't tie it to us.

01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.929
Yeah, yeah.

01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:36.770
Eddy, living well is the best revenge.

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:41.923
This could be our life, couldn't it?

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:45.602
This is our life.
We're not going back.

01:09:45.800 --> 01:09:48.121
And what's to miss?
Just things.

01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:51.167
You've never had attachments, have you?

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.210
They're not attachments.

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:56.124
They're parasites, ticks, danglers.

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.848
You can buy new things.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.121
Hmm.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:06.244
We're not going back.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.321
Do you want vodka in that?

01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.646
Yeah.

01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:18.247
I can't believe
you can afford a place
like this.

01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:22.970
Well, I do all our accounts
and I've been overpaying
meself for years.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:26.841
'Twas nowt but a wormhole
when I bought it, though.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.606
She's an idiot and she
tried to kill you, remember.

01:10:29.680 --> 01:10:30.681
I know, but...

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:32.800
I called the police.

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:36.851
They will find her.
And she will get...

01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.649
Hello, Saffy, dear.
Gran.

01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:00.281
Funniest thing...
I was wrong.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.846
Lola's not here?

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:04.766
It wasn't Shirley Bassey,
it was a lookalike.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.689
Gran, where is Lola?

01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:08.882
I have no idea, dear.

01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:10.765
Come on, Gloria.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.365
Have you got the balls?

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.367
Saff!

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.205
Emma. Lola!

01:11:18.760 --> 01:11:19.841
Are you all right?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.047
I'm fine.

01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:24.881
I found her cleaning my room.
They gave her to housekeeping.

01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:26.041
I'm so glad you're safe.

01:11:26.120 --> 01:11:27.121
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.367
I love you.

01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:32.326
Thanks.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:36.729
What are you doing here?

01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:38.206
Oh, it's a long story.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:41.204
Lulu called the police
because I saw
your mother here.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.721
Lulu?

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.691
Nick?

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.046
What?

01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.287
Oh, uh...

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:50.931
Hang on.
Can you look after Lola?

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:54.244
Of course.
I won't be long,
I promise.

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:02.087
Nick, I found Lola.
I found your mother.

01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:03.281
I don't care about my mother.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.362
Yes, you do. Drive!

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:08.281
Allez.

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.841
Go. Please.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.966
I don't normally like the stuff

01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:23.725
you get in hotel lobbies,
but this is quite nice.

01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:25.086
It's fabulous.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.966
Oh, I could get used to this.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.724
I am used to it.

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.121
Where's the wife?

01:12:34.320 --> 01:12:36.448
She's using the funicular.
She'll be hours.

01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:39.885
I tell you something, Eddy.

01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.726
Little Kate Moss, thank you.

01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.129
Oh. I mean, darling...

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:47.970
this could be the first day

01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:49.406
of the start of the whole days

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.323
of the rest of our lives,
couldn't it, really?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.890
Thanks to Lubey.
Yeah, thanks to Lubey.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.446
Are you growing
attached to Lubey, darling?

01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:01.007
We are just waiting for her
to change her will and die.

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.440
Oh, Eddy.

01:13:02.520 --> 01:13:03.965
I mean, has she changed her will yet?

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.761
All in good time, Eds, all in good time.

01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:11.327
Oh, I say. Hello.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.482
I'll just go and check that out.

01:13:23.040 --> 01:13:25.042
Saffy, listen.
I'm not coming home,

01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.167
so stop phoning me!

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.930
I've got the rest of my life to live

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.843
and I'm going to live it.

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:33.362
I'm done with all of you, so forget me.

01:13:33.440 --> 01:13:35.044
Just forget me.

01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.451
I'm walking down the road

01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.922
Looking at trees

01:13:40.320 --> 01:13:42.482
All the people going by

01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:46.481
They say "How do you look
so good today, Eddy?"

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:49.810
I say
"I don't know. I don't know"

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:57.522
So...

01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:00.522
have you been working here long?

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.840
You look pretty...
Oh, the mustache.

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.524
You're pretty gorgeous, too.

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:23.242
Eddy, Eddy! Eddy!

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.005
Eddy!
What, darling?

01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:27.202
The pigs, the fuzz...
your face!

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.050
We've got to leave.
The pigs, the fuzz,
your face!

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.005
The pigs, the pigs!

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.161
Quick!

01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.884
Come on, Eddy,
we've got to
get out of here.

01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:38.167
Cover your face.
Just hide, hide.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.086
Excusez-moi.
Hello.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.846
Excusez-moi, madame?

01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:55.246
I say!

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.846
Excusez-moi, madame?

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.200
Can I help you?

01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:17.611
Quick, quick, quick,
darling! Get in!

01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:26.291
Allez, allez!

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.640
I am allez-ing.

01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:34.209
Go left, go left!

01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:39.921
Keep going, Eddy!

01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:45.001
Go left!

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.481
At the end, go left.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:00.124
- Left.
- We've been left!

01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.564
What's that pedal?
Press that pedal.

01:16:04.680 --> 01:16:07.251
That pedal!
That pedal there!

01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:08.685
Oh. Oh.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.650
No, not that pedal.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:12.326
Not that pedal.

01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:14.321
Watch out!

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:18.167
- Oh, God!
- Merci.

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.365
That was quite nice.

01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:31.010
We've lost them, Eddy.

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:33.049
Shall I keep going?
Yeah! We're not giving in!

01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:36.083
Watch out!

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:38.288
Bloody bicyclettes!

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:41.682
We're not going back.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:47.284
Brake, Eddy!

01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:53.162
Oh, God! Whoa!

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:00.360
She could be anywhere.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.403
Bubble, you're alive!

01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:14.564
Welcome to my humble abode.

01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:17.327
Lulu? What are you
doing here?

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.085
I want to see you pay.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:20.207
Mum!

01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:22.129
- Saff.
- Oh, shit.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.526
Get out!

01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:25.051
No, no.

01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.401
Don't be ridiculous.

01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:28.323
Nick's come to take you
back for the hearing.

01:17:28.520 --> 01:17:29.567
Eddy?

01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:31.730
No, we're not going back, darling.

01:17:32.200 --> 01:17:33.725
Mum, get out of the water!

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.090
Eddy, we're sinking.

01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:41.402
Do get out of the pool,
Mrs. Monsoon.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:43.164
I would rather die

01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:45.322
than go back to all those hating faces!

01:17:46.320 --> 01:17:48.322
I mean, look at me, darling.

01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:52.761
All I've ever wanted was not to be fat...

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:54.486
and old.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:58.207
You know, darling.
To just keep
the party going.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:00.209
Now here I am.

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:04.607
Just fat and old and hated...

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.605
and nothing.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:08.525
I'm getting in.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:12.127
Darling, I know you think
I don't know who I am...

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.442
...and what I've done.

01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:17.607
But I do, darling, I do.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:21.122
I'm disgusting.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.604
Always wanting everything,
always taking more.

01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:27.244
Wearing stupid...

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.767
ridiculous small, small, small,

01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.241
stylish, stupid, ridiculous clothing!

01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:34.682
You think it's hard living with me,

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.808
try being at this end, darling.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:39.765
And it is all about me, isn't it?

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.126
It has been all about me.

01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:42.810
And me, Eds.

01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.290
Darling...

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:53.490
I've never given you
the love that you deserve.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.529
Before I go...

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.326
I want you to know that I love you.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.409
I love you, Mum.

01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:08.602
And Lola, sweetheart.

01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:11.161
And Pats.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:15.164
It's all right.

01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:18.448
You can let me go, darling.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:22.289
Let me go.
I'm going to join Kate

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:25.563
in the watery grave.
Let me go.

01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:28.524
Kate's not dead.

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:29.721
What?
What?

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.768
What?
She lives!

01:19:36.200 --> 01:19:37.201
Kate!

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:39.647
Jean Paul.
Where's the party?

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:41.888
The party is wherever you are, Kate!

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.526
I lost everyone.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:46.803
Sometimes it's good
to have lost some people.

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.362
You stay with me.
We make another
little party.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:54.686
You stupid, bloody, bollocking idiot!

01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.882
Why didn't you say that before?

01:19:57.320 --> 01:20:00.483
I just humiliated myself!

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.641
Hi, Kate, darling.

01:20:17.720 --> 01:20:20.291
No, I'm working from Nobu this week.

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:21.606
The world is at your feet

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:23.284
and I can make them stay there.

01:20:23.480 --> 01:20:24.606
Game-changing reinvention...

01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:27.251
You are the new face
of Louis Vuitton menswear.

01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:28.401
I know!

01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.001
No, I've done a big dump.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.321
I only represent you now.

01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:33.243
Got rid of Emma Bunton and Lulu.

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.767
I'm gonna be a big cheese
in the Big Apple.

01:20:36.360 --> 01:20:38.647
I am a big cheese!
Thank you, darling!

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:45.365
We are living the dream, darling.

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:46.646
We are, darling.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:52.644
Here I am, Edina Monsoon, on my way to...

01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.524
my book launch.
Yeah.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.282
Oh, darling, I lost
my pelvic floor on takeoff.

01:21:01.280 --> 01:21:03.328
Don't worry. We'll
pick it up on the way back.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:06.410
Fashion icon Kate Moss has
been found safe and well...

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.607
five days after falling
from a balcony into the river.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.723
It's been reported she is resting

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.928
at the home ofher
new P.R., Eddy Mon...

01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.569
Why is Kate Moss still here?

01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:20.564
Mum's doing her P. R. now.

01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:22.683
Apparently, she's never been so in demand

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:24.000
since she went missing.

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:25.965
So, darling, the plan is

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.441
we throw a huge party in Hyde Park.

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:30.921
Like a "Welcome Back, Kate" party.

01:21:32.440 --> 01:21:34.920
And darling, we should get Bollinger

01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:37.446
to give us a whole vintage.
A whole vintage, darling.

01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.682
Eddy, you'll want to wear couture.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.008
Yeah, yeah. No Stella.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:46.684
Am I still sending
all the bills
to Baroness Lublubliana...

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.321
Rothschild Von Thy...

01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:52.006
Mum, no!
You can't do that.

01:21:52.440 --> 01:21:54.010
No, Eddy, no, no, no.

01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:56.727
Think of our life, our dream!

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:58.764
Don't let this repellent little shrew

01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.604
take it away from us.

01:22:00.840 --> 01:22:02.569
Every time our life hits a good patch,

01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.325
this miserable piece of flesh ruins it.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.722
If you don't tell her, I will!

01:22:08.360 --> 01:22:11.489
Oh, you little bitch troll from hell.

01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.722
No!

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:33.087
Lubey, I have something to tell you.

01:22:34.360 --> 01:22:35.771
I'm not a man.

01:22:36.040 --> 01:22:37.485
I know.

01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:40.042
And I'm not a woman.

01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.525
Well, you don't mind
sleeping with him/her?

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.086
Does it mean
you don't need the strap-on?
I don't know.

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:03.526
Wheel's on fire

01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.966
Rolling down the road

01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:14.049
Best notify my next ofkin

01:23:14.520 --> 01:23:19.560
This wheel shall explode!

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:23.927
If your memory serves you well

01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.764
I was going to confiscate my lace

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:32.927
And wrap it up in a sailor's knot

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.930
And hide it in your case

01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:41.004
If I knew for sure that it was yours

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.567
But it was oh, so hard to tell

01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:49.206
But you knew that we would meet again

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:52.125
lfyour memory served you well

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:57.166
Wheel's on fire

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:03.483
Rolling down the road

01:24:03.720 --> 01:24:07.725
Best notify my next ofkin

01:24:08.160 --> 01:24:13.485
This wheel shall explode!

01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:17.885
If your memory serves you well

01:24:18.640 --> 01:24:21.644
You'll remember you're the one

01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:26.488
That called on me to call on them

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.645
To get you your favors done

01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:33.804
And after every plan had failed

01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:38.003
And there was nothing more to tell

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.920
You knew that we would meet again

01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:46.163
lfyour memory served you well

01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:51.081
Wheel's on fire

01:24:51.680 --> 01:24:57.244
Rolling down the road

01:24:57.600 --> 01:25:01.730
Best notify my next ofkin

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:07.883
This wheel shall explode!

01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:26.331
You talk like Marlene Dietrich

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:30.602
And you dance like Zizi Jeanmaire

01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:34.762
Your clothes are all made by Balmain

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:38.568
And there's diamonds
and pearls in your hair

01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:39.641
Yes, there are

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:44.888
You live in a fancy apartment

01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:48.849
Off
the Boulevard Saint-Michel

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:53.771
Where you keep your Rolling Stones records

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:56.730
And your friend of Sacha Distel

01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:57.801
Yes, you do

01:26:59.960 --> 01:27:03.328
Oh, but where do you go to, my lovely

01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:07.291
When you're alone in your bed?

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.963
Tell me the thoughts that surround you

01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:15.371
I want to look inside your head

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:16.641
Yes, I do

01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:22.008
I've seen all your qualifications

01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:26.082
You got from the Sorbonne

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.849
And the painting you stole from Picasso

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.004
Your loveliness goes on and on

01:27:34.080 --> 01:27:35.161
Yes, it does

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:40.289
Oh, when you go on your summer vacation

01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:44.130
You go to Juan-les-Pins

01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:48.801
With your carefully designed
topless swimsuit

01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:52.409
You get an even suntan

01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:54.842
On your back and on your legs

01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.887
And when the snow falls
you're found in St. Moritz

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:02.763
With the others of thejet-set

01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:07.081
And you sip your Napoleon brandy

01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:10.685
But you never get your lips wet

01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:12.000
No, you don't

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:17.811
But where do you go to my lovely

01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:21.443
When you're alone in your bed?

01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:25.329
Won't you
tell me the thoughts
that surround you?

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:29.284
I want to look inside your head

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.361
Yes, I do

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.483
Your name it is heard in high places

01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.802
You know the Aga Khan

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:43.808
He sent you a racehorse for Christmas

01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:49.920
And you keep itjust for fun
for a laugh, ha-ha-ha

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.009
They say that when you get married

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:58.163
It'll be to a millionaire

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.243
But they don't realize where you came from

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:06.129
And I wonder if they really care

01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:07.531
Or give a damn

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:13.047
Where do you go to, my lovely

01:29:13.800 --> 01:29:16.770
When you're alone in your bed?

01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:21.242
Tell me the thoughts that surround you

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:24.884
I want to look inside your head

01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:26.200
Yes, I do

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:31.444
I remember the back streets ofNaples

01:29:32.120 --> 01:29:35.522
Two children begging in rags

01:29:36.160 --> 01:29:39.801
Both touched with a burning ambition

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:43.485
To shake off
their lowly-borne tags

01:29:43.560 --> 01:29:45.210
They try

01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:49.926
So look into my face
Marie-Claire

01:29:50.960 --> 01:29:53.964
And remember just who you are

01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.521
Then go and forget me forever

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:03.165
But I know you still bear
the scar, deep inside

01:30:03.280 --> 01:30:04.486
Yes, you do

01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:09.000
I know where you go to my lovely

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.970
When you're alone in your bed

01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:17.169
I know the thoughts that surround you

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:24.491
'Cause I can look inside your head

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.369
People should go back to
watching videos of kittens.

01:30:49.440 --> 01:30:51.124
Now bugger off.
