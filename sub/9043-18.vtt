WEBVTT

00:02.467 --> 00:05.167
- AMY, THIS ROAST
IS SO TASTY.

00:05.167 --> 00:07.900
- YES, HONEY,
IT IS DELICIOUS.

00:07.900 --> 00:09.700
- THANKS.

00:09.700 --> 00:12.567
ROBERT MADE
THE POLICE BLOTTER THIS WEEK.

00:12.567 --> 00:14.733
- WOW!
WHAT WENT DOWN, MAN?

00:14.733 --> 00:19.033
A SHOOT-OUT WITH
SOME SMACK AND CRACK HEADS?

00:19.033 --> 00:20.567
- NO, NO.
NOTHING SO EXCITING.

00:20.567 --> 00:24.767
IT JUST SAID, "MAILBOX DEFACED.
UNIT RESPONDED."

00:24.767 --> 00:27.400
- HE WAS THE UNIT.

00:27.400 --> 00:30.067
- OH.

00:30.067 --> 00:32.967
- YOU KNOW, ROBERT, I ALWAYS
WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.167
- WHAT IS THAT, SIR?

00:34.167 --> 00:35.167
- WHY DO YOU TOUCH
YOUR FOOD

00:35.167 --> 00:36.367
TO YOUR CHIN

00:36.367 --> 00:38.400
BEFORE YOU PUT IT
IN YOUR MOUTH?

00:41.100 --> 00:42.300
- DAD.

00:42.300 --> 00:44.367
- NO, NO.
THAT'S OKAY, AMY.

00:44.367 --> 00:46.033
- YOU KNOW,
I NOTICED THAT TOO.

00:46.033 --> 00:49.867
WHY DO YOU DO THAT,
ROBERT?

00:49.867 --> 00:51.367
- IT'S--IT'S NOTHING.

00:51.367 --> 00:53.467
IT'S JUST A LITTLE HABIT
OF MINE, THAT'S ALL.

00:53.467 --> 00:56.667
- YEAH.
HE HARDLY EVER DOES IT.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.000
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.533
EVERY FAMILY
HAS THEIR ODDBALL.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.767
WITH US, IT'S MOM.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.800
- BUT WHY DO YOU DO IT?

01:13.800 --> 01:15.167
ARE YOU USING YOUR CHIN

01:15.167 --> 01:18.133
TO TEST THE TEMPERATURE
OF YOUR FOOD?

01:19.333 --> 01:21.067
- OH, THAT'S SILLY, HANK.

01:21.067 --> 01:22.933
HE'D HAVE A BIG,
RED MARK ON HIS CHIN

01:22.933 --> 01:26.100
EVERY TIME THE FOOD
WAS TOO HOT.

01:26.100 --> 01:28.733
- THAT'S TRUE.

01:28.733 --> 01:31.233
SO IT'S NOT THAT.

01:33.400 --> 01:35.100
- THAT'S WHERE HIS MOUTH WAS
WHEN HE GOT HERE.

01:35.100 --> 01:38.133
HE'S STILL GROWING.

01:52.867 --> 01:55.233
- HOW DOES EVERYBODY LIKE
THE SWEET POTATOES?

01:55.233 --> 01:58.867
- OH, YEAH. HEY, YOU BETTER GET
'EM BEFORE I EAT 'EM ALL UP.

01:58.867 --> 02:00.533
[laughter]

02:14.067 --> 02:17.600
- CUCKOO, CUCKOO!

02:17.600 --> 02:19.200
- PETER, STOP.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.167
I DON'T THINK
IT'S CUCKOO AT ALL.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.667
MAY I HAVE
A NAPKIN, PLEASE?

02:48.300 --> 02:50.133
- YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS THOUGHT

02:50.133 --> 02:52.233
THAT THAT CHIN THING WAS
JUST A NERVOUS HABIT.

02:52.233 --> 02:54.633
- BUT WHAT DID HE HAVE
TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT LAST NIGHT?

02:54.633 --> 02:57.633
WE WERE HAVING DINNER
WITH MY FAMILY.

02:58.967 --> 03:01.233
OH.

03:01.233 --> 03:03.900
- BY THE WAY,
IT'S NOT JUST YOUR FAMILY

03:03.900 --> 03:05.900
THAT STRESSES HIM OUT.

03:05.900 --> 03:07.767
- WHAT, ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM

03:07.767 --> 03:10.600
WITH MY FAMILY?

03:10.600 --> 03:12.933
- ALL I'M SAYING IS
THAT ROBERT BARONE

03:12.933 --> 03:16.033
HAS PLENTY OF REASONS TO DEVELOP
A NERVOUS HABIT OR TWO.

03:16.033 --> 03:18.033
I MEAN, ON TOP OF EVERYTHING
ELSE, HE'S A POLICEMAN.

03:18.033 --> 03:22.467
THE CHIN THING IS CLEARLY
A MANIFESTATION OF STRESS.

03:22.467 --> 03:24.067
WHAT?

03:24.067 --> 03:28.167
I TOOK BEHAVIORAL PSYCHOLOGY
IN COLLEGE.

03:32.733 --> 03:35.433
- SO YOU THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO?

03:35.433 --> 03:37.600
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU CAN FIX HIM,

03:37.600 --> 03:39.567
BUT YOU KNOW,
ANYTHING YOU CAN DO

03:39.567 --> 03:41.533
TO MAKE HIM LESS STRESSED,
I'M SURE THAT COULDN'T HURT.

03:41.533 --> 03:43.967
- WHY DON'T YOU GET
ONE OF THOSE FUNNELS

03:43.967 --> 03:45.333
THAT DOGS WEAR
AROUND THEIR NECK

03:45.333 --> 03:48.267
AND JUST THROW
THE FOOD IN THERE?

03:55.400 --> 03:57.867
- AMY, LET'S GO IN THERE.

03:57.867 --> 03:59.733
- WHAT?
WHAT?

03:59.733 --> 04:01.800
I'M TRYING TO HELP
MY SISTER-IN-LAW,

04:01.800 --> 04:04.033
WHO MARRIED A MAN
WITH STINKEROO FEET

04:04.033 --> 04:06.700
AND A CHIN DISORDER.

04:15.933 --> 04:17.633
- HEY.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.567
- HELLO.

04:19.567 --> 04:21.367
HOW ARE YOU?

04:21.367 --> 04:24.267
- HOW WAS YOUR DAY,
YOGI?

04:24.267 --> 04:27.133
- OH, GOOD.
PRETTY QUIET.

04:27.133 --> 04:28.600
HIT A LITTLE TRAFFIC
COMING HOME.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.933
- OH, I'M SORRY.
YOU HATE TRAFFIC.

04:30.933 --> 04:32.633
- AH, THAT'S OKAY.

04:32.633 --> 04:34.933
OOH, WHAT SMELLS GREAT?

04:34.933 --> 04:38.100
- WELL, THAT JUST MIGHT BE
YOUR FAVORITE FOOD.

04:38.100 --> 04:41.267
- RIBS FRA DIAVOLO?

04:41.267 --> 04:43.467
- WITH STEAK
AND MASHED POTATOES.

04:43.467 --> 04:46.567
AND BACON
AND A KEY LIME PIE.

04:46.567 --> 04:49.067
- IS MY MOM HERE?

04:49.067 --> 04:51.100
- NO, NO,
JUST ME AND YOU,

04:51.100 --> 04:53.433
AND NOBODY'S MOM
OR DAD OR BROTHER.

04:53.433 --> 04:56.133
- WOW. HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.
I'LL SET THE TABLE.

04:56.133 --> 04:57.867
- NO, NO.
I WANT YOU TO SIT.

04:57.867 --> 05:00.800
YOU JUST RELAX BECAUSE YOU'VE
GOT A BIG MEAL AHEAD OF YOU

05:00.800 --> 05:03.667
AND AFTER THAT...

05:03.667 --> 05:05.833
- OH!

05:05.833 --> 05:07.600
- WELL, IF I'D KNOWN
THIS WAS WAITING FOR ME,

05:07.600 --> 05:10.767
I WOULD'VE DRIVEN HOME
WITH THE SIREN ON.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.467
- WELL, I KNOW YOUR JOB
CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL,

05:14.467 --> 05:16.567
SO I WANT TO HELP
REDUCE THE STRESS.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.933
- WELL, THEN.
VERY NICE.

05:18.933 --> 05:20.933
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN ON THE FORCE
FOR 27 YEARS,

05:20.933 --> 05:22.433
SO I'M USED TO STRESS.

05:22.433 --> 05:24.700
AND YOU KNOW MY MOTTO
WHEN I'M ON THE BEAT--

05:24.700 --> 05:27.567
"DON'T BE AFRAID
TO PULL THE TRIGGER...

05:27.567 --> 05:30.733
ON YOUR SMILE."

05:30.733 --> 05:32.800
- I LOVE THAT MOTTO.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.467
- I KNOW.
ME TOO, ME TOO.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.133
- YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:37.133 --> 05:38.767
- YEAH.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

05:38.767 --> 05:41.400
- NOTHING.

05:41.400 --> 05:44.467
- IS SOMETHING WRONG?
- WHAT?

05:44.467 --> 05:48.000
- WELL, YOU WERE TOUCHING
FOOD TO YOUR CHIN.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.667
- EXCUSE ME?

05:49.667 --> 05:51.633
- YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.

05:51.633 --> 05:52.833
LOOK, I'M SORRY,

05:52.833 --> 05:55.033
BUT I THOUGHT YOU DID THAT
BECAUSE OF STRESS.

05:55.033 --> 05:57.167
ARE YOU STRESSED?
IT'S OKAY IF YOU'RE STRESSED.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.633
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU'RE STRESSED.

05:58.633 --> 06:01.933
ARE YOU STRESSED?

06:01.933 --> 06:04.067
- MAYBE A LITTLE BIT NOW.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.967
WHY ARE YOU BUGGING ME
ABOUT THIS?

06:08.967 --> 06:10.467
- NOBODY'S BUGGING YOU,
SWEETIE.

06:10.467 --> 06:11.667
WE ALL JUST WANT TO HELP.

06:11.667 --> 06:12.967
- WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WE ALL"?

06:12.967 --> 06:14.600
WHO'S "WE"?
- NOBODY.

06:14.600 --> 06:15.967
JUST SOME OF US
WERE TALKING.

06:15.967 --> 06:17.367
- WELL, WHO WAS TALKING?

06:17.367 --> 06:18.400
WHO'S THE "SOME OF US"
WHO WERE TALKING?

06:18.400 --> 06:20.400
- IT WAS JUST ME
AND RAY...

06:20.400 --> 06:22.067
- RAY?

06:22.067 --> 06:23.967
- AND DEBRA.
- DEBRA?

06:23.967 --> 06:26.500
DEBRA WAS TALKING ABOUT ME?
WHAT WAS SHE SAYING?

06:26.500 --> 06:29.167
- WAIT--WHY DOES DEBRA
BOTHER YOU MORE THAN RAY?

06:29.167 --> 06:32.533
YOU KNOW, YOU CARE WAY TOO MUCH
ABOUT HER OPINION.

06:32.533 --> 06:35.600
- WHAT I CARE ABOUT IS YOU
TRAVELING THE COUNTRYSIDE GOING,

06:35.600 --> 06:39.333
"WHO HAS A CURE
FOR MY HUSBAND THE LOON?"

06:39.333 --> 06:42.533
- I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.
- I DON'T NEED ANY HELP.

06:42.533 --> 06:45.633
- BUT WOULDN'T IT BE GOOD
TO FINALLY DEAL WITH YOUR...

06:45.633 --> 06:47.167
LITTLE CHIN PROBLEM?

06:47.167 --> 06:49.467
- OH, PROBLEM. I SEE.
SO NOW I HAVE A PROBLEM.

06:49.467 --> 06:52.633
WAS THAT THE VERDICT IN RAY
AND DEBRA'S KANGAROO COURT?

06:52.633 --> 06:54.200
- ROBERT, PLEASE.
- LOOK, LOOK.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.867
YOU THINK I HAVE A PROBLEM?

06:55.867 --> 06:57.467
WELL, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

06:57.467 --> 07:01.233
MAYBE--MAYBE--MAYBE YOU
HAVE THE PROBLEM, UH, MISSY.

07:03.300 --> 07:05.000
THAT'S RIGHT.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.333
WHAT ABOUT--WHAT ABOUT--

07:06.333 --> 07:07.867
WHAT ABOUT THE WAY
YOU EAT, HUH?

07:07.867 --> 07:10.200
AND THE--
[smacking]

07:10.200 --> 07:12.100
- I DON'T EAT LIKE THAT!

07:12.100 --> 07:13.667
- OH, YES.
YES, YOU DO EAT LIKE THAT.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.067
AND--AND--
AND YOU WALK FUNNY!

07:17.067 --> 07:18.067
[high-pitched voice]
HI.

07:18.067 --> 07:20.767
I'M AMY!
- ROBERT!

07:20.767 --> 07:23.100
- UH-HUH, MAYBE YOU DON'T THINK
YOU WALK LIKE THAT, BUT YOU DO.

07:23.100 --> 07:24.400
AND EVERY DAY,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.467
THE WORLD PRETENDS
NOT TO NOTICE.

07:26.467 --> 07:28.500
SO MAYBE YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO NEEDS THE HELP

07:28.500 --> 07:31.000
BECAUSE I AM
PERFECTLY FINE!

07:33.567 --> 07:36.567
- ROBERT, STOP IT!
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

07:36.567 --> 07:39.133
- I BELIEVE I'LL BE SLEEPING
AT MY PARENTS' HOUSE TONIGHT.

07:39.133 --> 07:43.033
THEY LOVE ME
FOR WHO I AM!

07:49.467 --> 07:52.300
- WHAT IS IT, MARIE?
- OH, THANK GOD.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.500
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
YOU WERE YELLING

07:53.500 --> 07:54.767
LIKE A CRAZY LADY
ON THE PHONE.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.500
THAT'S NOT YOU.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.533
- COME HERE.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.400
- SO?
HOSE HIM OFF,

08:02.400 --> 08:04.467
WE'LL ROLL HIM BACK
IN THE OCEAN.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.267
- MARIE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:14.267 --> 08:15.767
- ROBBIE AND AMY
HAD A BIG FIGHT,

08:15.767 --> 08:17.933
AND HE SPENT THE NIGHT HERE.
- OOH, WHAT HAPPENED?

08:17.933 --> 08:19.833
- I DON'T KNOW.
HE WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.767
- ALL RIGHT, I'M SURE
IT'S NO BIG DEAL. COME ON.

08:22.767 --> 08:24.700
- HE'S NOT MOVING BACK!

08:24.700 --> 08:27.900
I FINALLY HAD THE BOTH OF YOU
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.367
THERE WAS ONLY
ONE MORE TO GO.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.567
- HE'S RUINING
HIS LIFE AGAIN.

08:38.567 --> 08:40.267
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH MY BOYS

08:40.267 --> 08:41.467
THAT THEY HAVE SO MUCH TROUBLE
WITH WOMEN.

08:41.467 --> 08:42.667
- OH, MA.

08:42.667 --> 08:45.767
IT'S NORMAL
FOR COUPLES TO FIGHT, OKAY?

08:45.767 --> 08:49.367
REMEMBER THAT, IN CASE
YOU AND DAD EVER HAVE ONE.

08:50.867 --> 08:54.500
- HELLO, PROBLEM SOLVERS.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.333
- WHAT?

08:56.333 --> 08:57.933
- YOU TWO.
HAVE YOU MET THESE TWO?

08:57.933 --> 08:59.800
THEY'RE GREAT, MA.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.467
BECAUSE THEY ARE SO PERFECT
AND WITHOUT FLAW,

09:02.467 --> 09:04.633
THEY GET TOGETHER WITH,
SAY, SOMEBODY'S WIFE,

09:04.633 --> 09:06.567
AND THEY MAKE HER BELIEVE
THAT HER HUSBAND BELONGS

09:06.567 --> 09:09.500
IN A RUBBER ROOM
WITH A CHIN GUARD.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.600
IT'S QUITE A GIFT.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.167
- SHE SHOULD'VE JUST GOT
THE DOG FUNNEL.

09:21.433 --> 09:24.767
- ROBERT, AMY CAME TO US.

09:24.767 --> 09:27.933
SHE WAS JUST LOOKING FOR A WAY
TO HELP YOU WITH YOUR...

09:27.933 --> 09:30.867
- BOOPITY-BOOP.

09:30.867 --> 09:32.167
- LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS,

09:32.167 --> 09:33.367
WHEN I LEFT FOR WORK
YESTERDAY MORNING,

09:33.367 --> 09:34.733
MY WIFE WAS FINE WITH ME,

09:34.733 --> 09:36.133
AND AFTER AN HOUR WITH YOU TWO,

09:36.133 --> 09:38.167
SHE WANTED TO STRAP ME
TO A BED AT BELLEVUE.

09:38.167 --> 09:40.233
- OH, ROBERT,
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS!

09:40.233 --> 09:42.600
- YEAH, YOU COULDN'T FIT
INTO ONE OF THOSE BEDS.

09:45.200 --> 09:49.467
- HOW ABOUT I FIT YOU
INTO A JELLY JAR?

09:49.467 --> 09:52.333
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
IN A JELLY JAR?

09:52.333 --> 09:54.700
- MANY TIMES! MANY TIMES!
- THEN WE'LL GO IN!

09:54.700 --> 09:58.533
- I GO IN FOR NOTHING!
- PLEASE, ROBBIE!

09:58.533 --> 10:00.300
YOU TWO SHOULD BE
ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.767
WHAT GIVES YOU THE RIGHT
TO--TO BUTT INTO PEOPLE'S LIVES?

10:03.767 --> 10:05.667
- YES!

10:08.333 --> 10:11.567
- WHAT, YOU THINK
YOU CAN HELP HIM

10:11.567 --> 10:14.367
AFTER I SPENT
MY WHOLE LIFE TRYING?

10:14.367 --> 10:15.700
PLEASE.

10:15.700 --> 10:18.467
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO
IS PRETEND THAT HE'S FINE

10:18.467 --> 10:22.533
AND LET HIM BLEND INTO SOCIETY
AS BEST HE CAN.

10:28.467 --> 10:31.767
- HELLO, EVERYBODY.
ROBERT.

10:31.767 --> 10:33.667
- HEY.

10:33.667 --> 10:36.467
- OH, SEE, ROB,
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.200
- YEAH, WHY DON'T YOU GO OVER
AND KISS YOUR WIFE

10:38.200 --> 10:41.200
ON YOUR WAY
OUT OF MY HOUSE?

10:41.200 --> 10:44.700
- OH!
A KISS IS A GOOD IDEA.

10:46.900 --> 10:49.433
HERE WE GO!

10:53.767 --> 10:55.167
- IT'S OKAY, MARIE.

10:55.167 --> 10:56.633
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

10:56.633 --> 10:57.933
YOU TWO HAVE TO KISS,

10:57.933 --> 11:00.500
AND THEN I'LL GIVE YOU
A BIG BOWL OF ICE CREAM.

11:02.767 --> 11:04.000
- LOOK, ROBERT...

11:04.000 --> 11:06.600
I DID A LOT
OF THINKING LAST NIGHT,

11:06.600 --> 11:08.267
AND I'M SORRY.

11:08.267 --> 11:10.633
I REALIZED SOMETHING.

11:10.633 --> 11:13.233
YOU'VE BEEN DOING
YOUR LITTLE...THING

11:13.233 --> 11:14.767
A LOT MORE LATELY,

11:14.767 --> 11:17.867
NOT BECAUSE OF YOUR JOB
OR MY FAMILY OR...

11:17.867 --> 11:21.300
OTHER FAMILIES.

11:21.300 --> 11:25.267
BUT I THINK
THE REAL REASON IS...

11:25.267 --> 11:29.867
BECAUSE YOU HATE
BEING MARRIED.

11:29.867 --> 11:33.167
[sobs]

11:33.167 --> 11:36.233
- OH, NO, AMY,
THAT CAN'T BE IT.

11:36.233 --> 11:37.533
- YEAH,
I HATE BEING MARRIED,

11:37.533 --> 11:40.167
AND I DON'T DO
ANY GOOFY CRAP.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.600
- NO.

11:48.600 --> 11:51.000
NOW IT MAKES
PERFECT SENSE.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.200
I MEAN, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO

11:52.200 --> 11:53.867
IS REMEMBER THE 13 TIMES
WE BROKE UP

11:53.867 --> 11:57.500
TO SEE THAT MAYBE ROBERT'S
NOT COMFORTABLE WITH COMMITMENT.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.933
I TRIED TO HELP YOU
OVERCOME ALL THAT,

11:59.933 --> 12:02.967
BUT OBVIOUSLY...
I FAILED.

12:02.967 --> 12:05.567
- OH.
OH, AMY! AMY!

12:05.567 --> 12:08.833
NO, DON'T CRY!
YOU'RE WRONG.

12:08.833 --> 12:12.133
I'M HAPPY BEING MARRIED.
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER!

12:12.133 --> 12:14.467
- I'M HAPPY TOO!

12:14.467 --> 12:16.900
- LISTEN, I LOST
MY TEMPER LAST NIGHT,

12:16.900 --> 12:18.233
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE.

12:18.233 --> 12:19.633
AND ALL THOSE THINGS
I SAID ABOUT YOU,

12:19.633 --> 12:21.033
THEY'RE NOT TRUE.

12:21.033 --> 12:22.300
YOU HAVE THE CUTEST WALK
I'VE EVER SEEN,

12:22.300 --> 12:27.400
AND YOU DON'T EAT
LIKE A BEAVER!

12:27.400 --> 12:30.400
- WHAT HAPPENED
OVER THERE LAST NIGHT?

12:30.400 --> 12:33.233
- LISTEN, SWEETIE,
I'M SORRY.

12:33.233 --> 12:35.200
I LOVE YOU.

12:35.200 --> 12:39.667
- I LOVE YOU.

12:39.667 --> 12:40.900
- I LOVE YOU TOO.

12:40.900 --> 12:43.300
BYE, NOW!

12:45.933 --> 12:47.967
- WE HAVE A GREAT MARRIAGE,
BOO-BOO.

12:47.967 --> 12:49.800
YOU CAN RELAX.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.667
AND IF YOU RELAX,
THEN MAYBE I'LL RELAX,

12:52.667 --> 12:53.700
AND THEN, WHO KNOWS,

12:53.700 --> 12:55.667
MAYBE THAT'LL BE
THE END OF...

12:55.667 --> 12:57.667
CRAZY CHIN.

12:57.667 --> 13:01.467
- HE SAID WE HAVE
A GREAT MARRIAGE!

13:01.467 --> 13:03.433
- HOW ABOUT ANOTHER KISS?

13:05.767 --> 13:07.767
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:07.767 --> 13:09.233
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

13:09.233 --> 13:11.100
I MEAN, FORGIVE ME, ROBERT,

13:11.100 --> 13:14.300
BUT, YOU KNOW, WHY DO YOU DO
THE CHIN THING?

13:14.300 --> 13:16.933
- UH...
HAVE YOU NOT BEEN FOLLOWING?

13:16.933 --> 13:18.333
- NO, I MEAN,

13:18.333 --> 13:20.400
I-I UNDERSTAND
ABOUT STRESS.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.000
BUT OF ALL THE THINGS YOU
COULD DO TO DEAL WITH STRESS,

13:23.000 --> 13:24.967
YOU KNOW,
LIKE GRIND YOUR TEETH

13:24.967 --> 13:26.333
OR BITE YOUR NAILS...

13:26.333 --> 13:28.600
- PULL YOUR HAIR OUT.

13:38.933 --> 13:40.567
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
ROBERT?

13:40.567 --> 13:43.533
I MEAN, WHY DO YOU DO
THAT SPECIFIC THING?

13:43.533 --> 13:47.533
WHY DO YOU TOUCH FOOD
TO YOUR CHIN?

13:47.533 --> 13:49.633
- BECAUSE THE VOICES
TELL ME TO.

13:49.633 --> 13:50.900
YOU HAPPY NOW?

13:50.900 --> 13:52.867
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

13:52.867 --> 13:56.100
- GUYS, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST LEAVE WELL ENOUGH ALONE.

13:56.100 --> 13:58.567
YOU CALL THAT
"WELL ENOUGH"?

13:58.567 --> 14:00.567
- COME ON, ROBERT. TELL US.
I WANT TO KNOW.

14:00.567 --> 14:04.300
WHY DO YOU DO
THE MONKEY MOVE?

14:04.300 --> 14:07.267
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:07.267 --> 14:10.567
- ROBBIE, YOU'RE WITH FAMILY.
YOU CAN TELL US.

14:10.567 --> 14:13.067
- I DON'T KNOW!

14:16.667 --> 14:20.533
- I-I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
I SAW HIM DO IT.

14:20.533 --> 14:23.900
YEAH, IT WAS EASTER,
AND I WAS, LIKE, FIVE.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.600
AND MOM,
SHE MADE THE MISTAKE

14:25.600 --> 14:28.133
OF LEAVING ME AND ROBERT
ALONE WITH OUR EASTER BASKETS.

14:28.133 --> 14:30.133
SO WE JUST STARTED SHOVING CANDY
IN OUR MOUTHS

14:30.133 --> 14:31.667
AS FAST AS WE COULD.

14:31.667 --> 14:34.933
AND ROBERT WAS--WAS TOUCHING
EVERYTHING TO HIS CHIN.

14:34.933 --> 14:36.267
I WAS ONLY FIVE,

14:36.267 --> 14:39.200
BUT I STILL THINK I SAID,
"WHAT THE HELL?"

14:48.067 --> 14:49.867
ANYWAY, MOM COMES IN
AND GOES,

14:49.867 --> 14:52.500
"YOU TWO WEREN'T EATING CANDY
BEFORE DINNER, WERE YOU?"

14:52.500 --> 14:54.167
AND WE PLAYED IT TOTALLY COOL.

14:54.167 --> 14:57.333
WE SAID, "NO, MOMMY, NO,"
AND--AND I THOUGHT,

14:57.333 --> 15:00.567
"FOR SURE, WE'RE GOING
TO GET AWAY WITH IT."

15:00.567 --> 15:04.233
AND THEN I LOOK UP,
AND STICKING TO ROBERT'S CHIN...

15:04.233 --> 15:07.700
IS THE TAIL
OF A MARSHMALLOW DUCK.

15:14.167 --> 15:17.300
- AND WHAT DID I DO
TO TEACH YOU TWO A LESSON?

15:17.300 --> 15:22.300
both: GAVE OUR CANDY
TO POOR CHILDREN.

15:22.300 --> 15:25.433
- IT WAS DELICIOUS.

15:29.233 --> 15:31.400
- OKAY,
SO WAIT, ROBERT,

15:31.400 --> 15:34.033
MAYBE YOU WERE NERVOUS
ABOUT BEING CAUGHT BY MARIE,

15:34.033 --> 15:39.767
AND SO YOU...
FORGOT HOW TO EAT.

15:39.767 --> 15:44.267
- REALLY?

15:44.267 --> 15:47.533
THAT'S WHAT YOU LEARNED
IN COLLEGE?

15:47.533 --> 15:51.500
WHAT, WAS IT ONE
OF THOSE HAIR COLLEGES?

15:51.500 --> 15:55.067
- OH, ROBERT WAS DOING IT
BEFORE THEN, ANYWAY.

15:55.067 --> 15:56.600
I REMEMBER ONE TIME--

15:56.600 --> 15:59.000
- OH, GOD, IT'S LIKE
THE SPECIAL PSYCHO EDITION

15:59.000 --> 16:01.633
OF "THIS IS YOUR LIFE."

16:01.633 --> 16:03.600
- I REMEMBER ONE TIME,
I TOOK HIM TO THE LODGE,

16:03.600 --> 16:05.933
AND HE SPOTTED A JAR OF PICKLES
ON THE BAR.

16:05.933 --> 16:08.000
SO I GIVE HIM ONE.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.233
AND HE STARTS
DOING HIS THING,

16:11.233 --> 16:13.367
AND ALL MY BUDDIES START
FEEDING HIM MORE PICKLES

16:13.367 --> 16:15.133
TO WATCH HIM DO IT.

16:15.133 --> 16:16.500
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:16.500 --> 16:18.833
IT TURNS OUT THOSE PICKLES
WERE ON THAT BAR

16:18.833 --> 16:23.500
WHEN THE LODGE OPENED
IN 1952.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.933
ROBERT THREW UP
LIKE NIAGARA FALLS!

16:25.933 --> 16:32.067
[laughing]

16:32.933 --> 16:35.967
OH, WELL.

16:35.967 --> 16:37.567
DOES THAT
SOLVE YOUR MYSTERY?

16:37.567 --> 16:42.333
- NO, BUT NOW WE KNOW
WHY ROBERT SCREAMS AT PICKLES.

16:45.400 --> 16:49.533
- NO, THAT'S--
THAT'S INTERESTING, FRANK.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.200
CANDY...

16:51.200 --> 16:54.000
AND PICKLES...

16:54.000 --> 16:58.700
- IT'S LIKE
WATCHING FREUD WORK.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.967
- I NEVER CARED HOW THE FOOD
GOT IN THE BOYS' MOUTHS

17:03.967 --> 17:05.833
AS LONG AS THEY ATE.

17:05.833 --> 17:09.167
BUT I REMEMBER DINNERTIME.

17:09.167 --> 17:11.533
RAYMOND WOULD BE SITTING
IN HIS LITTLE HIGH CHAIR,

17:11.533 --> 17:14.667
AND FRANK ALWAYS HAD
TO WORK LATE BACK THEN.

17:14.667 --> 17:17.867
IT WAS A WONDERFUL TIME.

17:17.867 --> 17:22.600
AND I WOULD FEED RAYMOND
HIS SWEET POTATOES AND PEAS.

17:22.600 --> 17:25.767
AND YOU'D MAKE
THE CUTEST FACES.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.467
I'M TELLING YOU,

17:27.467 --> 17:29.200
HE SHOULD'VE BEEN
ON COMMERCIALS.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.567
HE WAS SO MUCH CUTER
THAN THAT GERBER BABY.

17:31.567 --> 17:35.167
- OH, NOT CUTER.
WE WERE BOTH CUTE.

17:35.167 --> 17:38.300
I REMEMBER
I'D GET A BIG SPOONFUL,

17:38.300 --> 17:41.333
AND I WOULD SAY...

17:41.333 --> 17:45.200
"HERE COMES AN AIWPWANE
IN FOR A WANDING!"

17:45.200 --> 17:46.200
- MA, PLEASE.

17:46.200 --> 17:47.767
- COME ON!
- STOP IT.

17:47.767 --> 17:49.467
- YOUR AIWPWANE'S WAITING.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.333
- STOP IT. NO.
- COME ON!

17:51.333 --> 17:53.200
- ZOOM! ZOOM! ZOOM!

17:53.200 --> 17:56.167
THERE WE GO.
OH, THERE!

17:56.167 --> 17:58.400
OH, OOPS, OOPS, OOPS.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.767
WE DON'T WANT THE AIRLINE
TO LOSE YOUR LUGGAGE.

18:01.767 --> 18:04.933
HERE YOU GO.
THERE.

18:04.933 --> 18:07.067
THERE'S THAT CUTE FACE!
HEE HEE!

18:07.067 --> 18:09.067
- ALL RIGHT, MA.
OKAY!

18:09.067 --> 18:11.500
- WAIT A MINUTE.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.933
MARIE...

18:13.933 --> 18:17.267
WHERE WAS ROBERT WHEN YOU WERE
FEEDING CUTE, LITTLE RAYMOND?

18:17.267 --> 18:20.067
- I DON'T KNOW.

18:29.333 --> 18:30.867
- OKAY, WELL,
HOW ABOUT THIS?

18:30.867 --> 18:32.433
MARIE,
BEFORE RAY WAS BORN,

18:32.433 --> 18:34.500
DO YOU REMEMBER DOING
THE AIRPLANE THING TO ROBERT?

18:34.500 --> 18:35.767
- SURE.

18:35.767 --> 18:37.400
- SO ISN'T IT POSSIBLE

18:37.400 --> 18:39.933
THAT WHILE YOU
WERE WIPING RAY'S CHIN,

18:39.933 --> 18:43.033
ROBERT WAS FEELING NEGLECTED,

18:43.033 --> 18:47.333
AND THAT'S WHEN HE STARTED
TAKING CARE OF HIMSELF?

18:51.233 --> 18:54.033
SO YOU SEE, ROBERT,
WHEN RAY CAME ALONG,

18:54.033 --> 18:57.367
YOU STARTED TOUCHING FOOD TO
YOUR CHIN AS A SUBCONSCIOUS WAY

18:57.367 --> 18:59.667
OF TRYING TO GET
YOUR MOTHER'S ATTENTION AGAIN.

18:59.667 --> 19:02.967
AND NOW, THAT'S YOUR WAY OF
DEALING WITH ANY KIND OF STRESS.

19:02.967 --> 19:05.433
THAT MAKES SENSE, RIGHT?

19:05.433 --> 19:09.267
SEE?
I TOLD YOU I WOULD GET IT!

19:09.267 --> 19:12.067
I'M SORRY, ROBERT.

19:12.067 --> 19:14.533
- WHO WANTS
A BIG BOWL OF ICE CREAM?

19:16.633 --> 19:18.067
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

19:18.067 --> 19:19.900
- NOTHING'S WRONG
WITH YOU, ROBERT.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.200
- NO?

19:21.200 --> 19:23.000
MY KID BROTHER ARRIVES,
AND FROM THEN ON,

19:23.000 --> 19:26.033
I GOT TO RUB LUNCH
ON MY FACE?

19:26.033 --> 19:28.533
- ROBERT, I KNOW IT DOESN'T
SEEM LIKE IT RIGHT NOW,

19:28.533 --> 19:31.700
BUT THIS IS
A GOOD MOMENT FOR YOU.

19:31.700 --> 19:33.600
YOU UNDERSTAND SOMETHING
ABOUT YOURSELF,

19:33.600 --> 19:36.700
AND NOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND IT,
YOU CAN STOP IF YOU WANT.

19:36.700 --> 19:39.467
- YEAH,
BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING

19:39.467 --> 19:41.367
IS THAT WE ALL
HAVE TO REMEMBER

19:41.367 --> 19:44.033
THAT YOUR PROBLEM
WAS NOBODY'S FAULT.

19:44.033 --> 19:46.767
HERE YOU GO, RAYMOND.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.700
- HAPPY WANDING.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.367
- HEY THERE, CUBBY.

20:05.367 --> 20:08.267
- HEY.

20:08.267 --> 20:09.667
WHAT?
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

20:09.667 --> 20:11.100
- OH, NOTHING.

20:11.100 --> 20:14.133
JUST THINKING
ABOUT THAT CHIN THING THAT I DO.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.767
THAT'S RIGHT,
I'M TALKING ABOUT IT.

20:16.767 --> 20:20.067
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP
IN GETTING OVER SOMETHING:

20:20.067 --> 20:24.100
ACCEPTANCE AND TALKING.

20:28.033 --> 20:30.133
I'M SEEING DR. GREENBERG.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.133
- AH.

20:32.133 --> 20:33.467
OH, THAT'S GOOD.
GREAT.

20:33.467 --> 20:35.333
- YEAH, AND, YOU KNOW,
HE MADE ME REALIZE

20:35.333 --> 20:36.867
THAT JUST BECAUSE I HAVE
LEGITIMATE EXCUSES

20:36.867 --> 20:38.267
FOR DOING SOMETHING

20:38.267 --> 20:40.033
DOESN'T MEAN
I HAVE TO KEEP ON DOING IT.

20:40.033 --> 20:41.400
STARTING TODAY,

20:41.400 --> 20:43.200
I'M NOT TOUCHING ANY FOOD
TO MY CHIN.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.767
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.367
[laughs]

20:48.367 --> 20:50.600
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
GOOD FOR YOU, MAN.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.800
- THE KNICKS ARE CRAZY IF THEY
DON'T RENEW HIS CONTRACT.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.567
- DID YOU SEE RAY BARONE'S
COLUMN ABOUT THAT?

20:55.567 --> 20:57.667
- HEY, HEY, HEY!
HE'S TALKING ABOUT ME.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.067
- YEAH, HE'S RIGHT
ON THE MONEY.

20:59.067 --> 21:00.367
- HE USUALLY IS.

21:00.367 --> 21:01.667
- YOU KNOW,
I THINK RAY BARONE'S

21:01.667 --> 21:02.900
THE BEST COLUMNIST
IN NEW YORK, HANDS DOWN.

21:02.900 --> 21:04.567
[buzzer sounds]

21:04.567 --> 21:06.700
- THAT'S THE END OF THE QUARTER
WITH THE KNICKS UP BY FIVE.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.800
- OH, MAN!
WHY WASN'T I TAPING THAT?

21:09.800 --> 21:11.133
- YEAH, THAT WAS GOOD.

21:11.133 --> 21:13.167
GOOD FOR YOU, RAYMOND.
