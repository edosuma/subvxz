WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.440 --> 00:12.212
We're back and things
are about to get fucking naughty.

00:12.278 --> 00:16.916
It's going to be bigger...
and better than ever before.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.485
(cheering)

00:18.551 --> 00:20.387
More kissing.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.288
Getting fucked up.

00:22.355 --> 00:24.023
More tears.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.526
Arguing.
(shouting)

00:29.529 --> 00:31.398
Bring... it... on.

00:31.464 --> 00:35.301
This is the moment that me and Gary
are gonna have sex

00:35.368 --> 00:37.904
for the first time
in nearly two years.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.806
Me fanny is so worried.

00:43.543 --> 00:46.980
Unfinished business.
Are you having a fucking laugh?

00:47.046 --> 00:50.617
(shouting)

00:50.683 --> 00:53.019
I'm pissed and I'm so fucking angry

00:53.086 --> 00:56.723
so there's nothing gonna stop me
from having a laugh with Marnie.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.459
So I've ended up kissing Scott.

00:59.526 --> 01:01.628
What the fuck is wrong with us?

01:01.694 --> 01:04.164
I'm gonna fucking flip me like.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.266
You're snakes. Yous belong together.

01:06.332 --> 01:09.536
That's me, him and her done.
It's gonna go off.

01:09.602 --> 01:11.871
I'm gonna sort this
with Aaron right now.

01:15.041 --> 01:18.678
Everyone here may be able to forgive
and forget but I'm not fake.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.146
There's no coming back.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.983
I should have a degree in pulling.

01:24.050 --> 01:26.286
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:26.352 --> 01:28.788
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:28.855 --> 01:30.957
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:31.024 --> 01:32.859
I'd never kiss without a six-pack.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.861
The hardest graft is doing me hair.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.930
I'm cheeky and full of mischief.

01:36.996 --> 01:38.865
I'm fit, flirty, got double Fs.

01:38.932 --> 01:41.334
I'm gonna make sparks fly.

01:41.401 --> 01:43.636
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

01:51.845 --> 01:53.046
After last night

01:53.112 --> 01:56.483
I'm really hung-over
and all I want is a cuddle from Gary

01:56.549 --> 01:58.585
so I'm gonna go get in his bed.

02:03.189 --> 02:06.860
I slept alone last night but this
morning Charlotte sneaked in

02:06.926 --> 02:09.729
to give us a nice little surprise.
Sweet.

02:15.401 --> 02:19.205
Last night I couldn't be arsed with
all the tension between me and Aaron

02:19.272 --> 02:22.308
I decided to get a good sleep
and gaan to the shag pad.

02:23.543 --> 02:26.446
I don't want me and Aaron
to fall out completely.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.749
Mebbes I was in the wrong but
what am I meant to do if that divvy

02:29.816 --> 02:31.684
won't even talk to us about it?

02:35.989 --> 02:37.724
(laughter)

02:40.026 --> 02:43.796
I wake up and I'm in bed with Gary
and Holly's in bed with Kyle.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.098
The boyfriend club.

02:45.164 --> 02:48.268
Remember when she used to
just come in and suck you off?

02:49.335 --> 02:50.336
She did. (laughs)

02:50.403 --> 02:52.438
Oh, my God,
some things never change.

02:55.041 --> 02:58.444
I thought everyone was asleep
when Charlotte was sucking us off,

02:58.511 --> 03:00.547
but turns out Aaron wasn't. Awkward.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.017
(girls) Yeah.

03:04.083 --> 03:05.451
You did well last night.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.820
Turned your back and walked away,
best way.

03:07.887 --> 03:10.657
I'm proud of meself
for ignoring Marnie and Scott.

03:10.723 --> 03:13.426
They don't deserve me forgiveness
just yet.

03:13.493 --> 03:16.095
I won't speak to someone
that stabs us in the back.

03:16.162 --> 03:17.964
They'll do it again.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.967
As far as I'm concerned,
they might as well not be here.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.404
Aaron is right to be angry
cos they both betrayed him.

03:24.470 --> 03:29.509
But you've gotta sort it out but that
is not gonna happen any time soon.

03:29.576 --> 03:32.245
When's this fucking double dating
gonna happen?

03:32.312 --> 03:34.347
Look at Holly's little face.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.282
Do you wanna go on a double date?

03:36.349 --> 03:40.186
(chanting) Double date, double date,
double date, double date.

03:45.758 --> 03:46.759
Yeah.

03:46.826 --> 03:50.663
No-one can make me feel any more
guilty than I already feel.

03:50.730 --> 03:53.766
There's an atmosphere. I don't know
what I can do to fix it.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.103
No.
No?

03:57.170 --> 03:59.973
Well, there's no-one fucking left,
is there?

04:00.039 --> 04:02.041
You've kissed all the single lads.

04:04.243 --> 04:05.845
Yeah, I have actually.

04:05.912 --> 04:09.048
James is right,
I've kissed every lad in this house.

04:09.115 --> 04:11.484
I just can't seem
to stay out of trouble.

04:13.653 --> 04:16.589
(phone rings)
Phone's ringing!

04:16.656 --> 04:18.558
Hello.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.526
Hiya, Vicky.
Hi, Anna.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.431
Right, OK, brilliant.

04:28.368 --> 04:32.705
Anna calls and tomorrow night we're
all gonna be hosting a hoe down.

04:32.772 --> 04:37.076
I bet the lads are beside themselves
with pun opportunities. The twats.

04:37.143 --> 04:40.346
We're hosting a hoe down.
What? Where is it?

04:40.413 --> 04:42.849
In Gloucestershire.
A what? A hoe down?

04:42.915 --> 04:47.053
We're going to a hoe down
in Gloucester for Tash on Tours.

04:47.120 --> 04:50.289
How bad can it be?
Loads of hoes just getting down.

04:50.356 --> 04:55.695
Come on let's get ready for our
double date... with our boyfriends.

04:55.762 --> 04:58.031
Ooh, yeah.

04:59.999 --> 05:02.568
Me and Holly are getting ready
for our double date

05:02.635 --> 05:04.904
and we are so excited.

05:04.971 --> 05:07.774
This'll be your second date
with Gary. I know.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.276
You're practically together.
I know.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.679
So do you think you'll kiss Gary?

05:12.745 --> 05:17.583
Well, I'll try and kiss him
and he'll pull away. (both laugh)

05:18.484 --> 05:20.820
Me and Gary are getting on so well,

05:20.887 --> 05:23.690
we're even going on double dates
with Holly and Kyle.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.958
Things are moving pretty quick.

05:26.025 --> 05:29.529
Do you think you'll kiss Kyle?
Mm, I dunno.

05:29.595 --> 05:32.665
Yeah, you will kiss Kyle
and he won't pull away.

05:32.732 --> 05:36.736
I feel like he's just trying to shag
us and, like, I'm not gonna.

05:36.803 --> 05:41.541
I know but you can string him along
and see if that is all he wants.

05:41.607 --> 05:45.244
I really, really, really wanna
have sex with Kyle, but I can't.

05:45.311 --> 05:49.248
I want him to like me, not just my
fairy and he needs to prove himself.

05:49.315 --> 05:50.616
Girls you ready?

05:50.683 --> 05:52.285
Girlfriend?

05:52.351 --> 05:55.021
Yep.
See yous girls, bye.

05:55.088 --> 05:58.024
The girls have been banging on
about a double date.

05:58.091 --> 06:01.861
I thought something fun. No.
Something romantic? Definitely not.

06:01.928 --> 06:05.331
Then I thought something scary.
Fucking yes.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.802
Put these on... now.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.038
Where the fuck
has Gary brought us to?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.507
This is not my idea of a double date.

06:14.574 --> 06:17.977
Follow me. No, I don't like it.
I don't like it.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.846
Welcome to your double date.

06:19.912 --> 06:22.215
A trip around a horror farm.

06:22.281 --> 06:26.319
Look at these two holding hands
as though that's gonna help.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.321
Hello love, you all right?

06:28.387 --> 06:31.724
What the fuck
has Gary brought us to?

06:31.791 --> 06:34.827
(screaming)

06:34.894 --> 06:38.097
(screams)

06:38.164 --> 06:40.533
(shouting)

06:40.600 --> 06:44.937
This is the weirdest place
I've ever been to. I'm terrified.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.806
A bit of wee just came out.

06:46.873 --> 06:48.241
(screams)

06:48.307 --> 06:50.309
Aww, nah.

06:53.045 --> 06:58.017
Holly's buzzing in this scary place
cos gives her a chance to cosy up.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.853
(crazy laughter)
Hello.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.823
(screams)

07:04.924 --> 07:05.925
Fuck me!

07:05.992 --> 07:10.296
I'm prone to pissing meself but I've
now moved on to shitting meself.

07:10.363 --> 07:13.699
(screams)(screams)
Oh, my... Fuck!

07:13.766 --> 07:15.568
No, no, no.
Why? Why?

07:15.635 --> 07:20.606
(chatters) We can go out camping,
we can go out shopping.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.108
I've fucked up here.

07:22.175 --> 07:25.478
I'm on a double date but I'm spending
no time with Charlotte.

07:25.545 --> 07:28.181
Instead I've got a clown
licking my face.

07:28.247 --> 07:29.348
(laughs)

07:29.415 --> 07:31.284
Gary.
Gary!

07:31.350 --> 07:33.853
Gary.
(screams)

07:33.920 --> 07:38.324
Gary is never allowed to choose
where we go on a date ever again.

07:38.391 --> 07:41.427
(screaming)

07:45.865 --> 07:49.068
I don't want me and Aaron
to fall out completely.

07:49.135 --> 07:53.206
I never meant to upset him. I don't
wanna lose a friend, it need sorted.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.841
Can I talk to you?

07:54.907 --> 07:59.979
Things are really awkward. I don't
know if it'll get back to normal.

08:00.046 --> 08:02.849
I want to apologise
for everything I've done.

08:02.915 --> 08:05.518
Don't get us wrong,
I fucking feel terrible.

08:05.585 --> 08:07.220
I should never lost me temper

08:07.286 --> 08:09.689
but when buttons are pushed
you can't help it,

08:09.755 --> 08:12.091
a friend stabbing me in the back
is one.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.261
Basically the way I acted was
because you went for us

08:15.328 --> 08:18.931
and I've never really had a mate
pure go for us like that.

08:18.998 --> 08:21.000
I was just, like, proper foaming

08:21.067 --> 08:25.171
at the time and basically because of
that, that's why I got with Marnie.

08:25.238 --> 08:27.373
Scott's saying
he was getting us back.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.010
It's not fucking tit for tat,
and this isn't a fucking playground.

08:31.077 --> 08:35.514
I cannot forget yet but I appreciate
your apology. I love you to bits.

08:36.948 --> 08:41.254
Me and Aaron have sorted everything
out. We can put this shit to bed.

08:42.989 --> 08:46.959
Scott and Aaron have made up. He
hasn't made up with me that quick.

08:47.026 --> 08:49.962
I was drunk.
I didn't know what I was doing.

08:50.029 --> 08:53.165
Every time you make a mug out of us
you're fucking drunk.

08:53.232 --> 08:58.237
Marnie's trying to apologise, she's
not getting away with it that easily

08:58.304 --> 09:01.374
I forgave you twice
so I don't see why I should now.

09:01.440 --> 09:05.578
The last thing on my mind was
kissing Scott. Obviously it wasn't.

09:05.645 --> 09:09.382
Aaron's just going in. He's not
listening to anything I'm saying.

09:09.448 --> 09:12.184
No-one can make me feel
any more guilty.

09:12.251 --> 09:14.186
So, we're not gonna be friends?

09:14.253 --> 09:18.758
We don't do anything anyway.
Cos I didn't you shag you like Gaz?

09:18.824 --> 09:21.127
Oh, my God, did you just say that?

09:21.193 --> 09:24.463
You're saying all we do is kiss
and cuddle. I did.

09:24.530 --> 09:27.166
I can't fucking believe
he's gone there about Gary.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.769
He knows things were different
so how dare he?

09:29.835 --> 09:33.539
Aaron, like. See? Cos you know it's
not fucking bad with me, Marnie.

09:33.606 --> 09:34.907
That's not what I meant.

09:34.974 --> 09:38.611
I shouldn't have said what I said
but she made her own bed

09:38.678 --> 09:40.813
so she can lie in it.

09:46.352 --> 09:50.823
This has totally backfired. Speaking
to Aaron has made us feel much worse

10:04.437 --> 10:07.306
I know that Aaron's stubborn

10:07.373 --> 10:10.009
but swallow your pride
and forgive and forget.

10:24.490 --> 10:25.658
Right, OK.

10:25.725 --> 10:29.295
We've pissed each other off
and hurt each other's feelings.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.364
But we've apologised so we're even.

10:37.903 --> 10:39.805
There they are.
Hiya.

10:39.872 --> 10:40.940
Oi-oi.

10:41.007 --> 10:43.409
The couples get back
and they seem buzzing.

10:43.476 --> 10:47.179
Everyone's getting pure wifed in.
I was thinking about settling down

10:47.246 --> 10:50.850
and going on dates, then I realised
I'm Scotty Fucking T.

10:56.322 --> 11:00.359
We're getting ready. I wanna look
unreal, ready to hit the town.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.866
Whey, me Aaron and Scott
have made up.

11:06.932 --> 11:09.035
I'm buzzing about that.
Yeah, buzzing.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.806
Just watch this space.
(laughter)

11:13.873 --> 11:17.543
This might be wishful thinking
but I'm sure I can win Aaron back.

11:17.610 --> 11:21.213
We like each other too much to let
some kiss with Scott ruin it.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.748
(all) Cheers.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.050
Let's go.

11:24.116 --> 11:28.454
Fuck it. No more dramas, we're all
mates again. Let's have a top night.

11:33.225 --> 11:37.363
I should know sexy dancing doesn't
work when you're this rat arsed.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.933
If she thinks that's gonna win us
over, she's a fucking idiot.

11:43.135 --> 11:45.504
We've bitten off
more than we can chew.

11:48.240 --> 11:49.375
Awkward.

11:49.442 --> 11:51.544
Can someone open the door?

11:51.610 --> 11:53.813
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye.

11:56.348 --> 11:56.549
.

11:59.085 --> 11:59.285
.

12:09.795 --> 12:11.797
(cheering)

12:11.864 --> 12:15.367
We get to the club,
we're having such an amazing night.

12:15.434 --> 12:19.505
We've got hats, masks on and there's
confetti. It's like I'm at a wedding.

12:24.210 --> 12:27.580
We're having a mint night
and everyone's loving life

12:27.646 --> 12:30.116
but as always,
I'm number one dancer.

12:34.687 --> 12:38.724
I really like Kyle. I just wanna be
sure that I can trust him.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.893
It's getting difficult to stay away.

12:49.869 --> 12:52.705
Holly's got Kyle
by the short and curlies.

12:52.771 --> 12:57.042
I feel like she's got him hypnotised
with her tits. Despite that,

12:57.109 --> 12:58.677
they really get on.

13:00.012 --> 13:04.183
I'm gutted I'm not in the boyfriend
club. I'm gonna speak to Aaron.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.552
I'm pretty sure I can win him back.

13:13.492 --> 13:16.695
Marnie's running back for more
because she's all over us.

13:16.762 --> 13:19.131
You're not getting to us
that easily.

13:26.839 --> 13:29.041
(excited chattering)

13:29.108 --> 13:33.279
Is Aaron for real? How long's
he gonna act like a bellend?

13:35.281 --> 13:40.286
Marnie is doing my head in. She's
all over us. I'm staying well away.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.700
I'm gonna make sure
Aaron can't resist us.

13:54.767 --> 13:58.370
I'm gonna shake me arse,
get fucking mortal. Let's do this.

14:03.876 --> 14:06.078
Marnie's sexy dancing is laughable.

14:06.145 --> 14:09.281
She thinks that's gonna win us over,
she's a fucking idiot.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.718
I'm far too drunk.

14:12.785 --> 14:16.155
Sexy dancing doesn't work
when you're this rat arsed.

14:26.565 --> 14:31.270
Marnie's been all over us but she
won't be back in my bed tonight.

14:34.306 --> 14:38.978
Tonight's been mint but we best head
home cos we've gotta be up so early

14:39.044 --> 14:41.513
cos we're taking Tash on Tours
on tour.

14:50.189 --> 14:51.690
Wake up.

14:51.757 --> 14:55.160
I'm absolutely mortal.
I can't even see straight.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.630
Somebody please just get us to bed.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.234
This is getting a habit of yours.
No.

15:07.239 --> 15:11.243
Me and Kyle get into bed and we've
only got two hours to cuddle.

15:11.310 --> 15:14.613
I'd rather sack Gloucester off
and stay in bed with him.

15:20.953 --> 15:23.055
Hey, Char?

15:24.890 --> 15:27.226
You OK? (groans)
You gonna be sick?

15:28.494 --> 15:32.064
I'm in bed with Charlotte and she
starts making weird noises.

15:32.131 --> 15:33.866
That's not her sleep talking,

15:33.932 --> 15:36.869
that's the noise she makes
when she pisses herself.

15:41.607 --> 15:43.509
It's the glass. Watch the glass.

15:46.312 --> 15:50.916
Charlotte is 24, how many 24 year-old
girls do you know that piss the bed?

15:50.983 --> 15:53.686
Or piss on the leg of the lad
they're shagging?

15:53.752 --> 15:59.091
I'm gonna put her on her bed cos
we've gotta be up so early for work.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.733
Howeh, lads, are yous ready?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.001
You ready, pet?

16:09.068 --> 16:12.871
I've woke up, it's dead early, we're
taking Tash on Tours to the country.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.447
I can't stand up. I'm still pissed.

16:21.513 --> 16:24.616
How the hell am I gonna go
to Gloucestershire?

16:24.683 --> 16:28.220
Despite the fact
that some of wor party are pissed,

16:28.287 --> 16:32.691
everyone is present and accounted
for and ready to hit the road.

16:36.195 --> 16:39.531
Fucking hell!
Oh, my God.

16:39.598 --> 16:43.502
There's a spaceship on wheels.
I feel like I'm part of One D.

16:43.569 --> 16:48.040
It's like the best tour bus ever.
Oh, my God, it's unreal.

16:48.107 --> 16:51.443
Anna has pulled all the stops out
with this bus.

16:51.510 --> 16:55.848
It's pretty swanky. I wish I could
take credit for it. In fact I might.

17:09.994 --> 17:15.134
Things were going really well, but
I pissed all over him last night.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.835
I hope he's not mad.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.240
She's marking her territory.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.477
You could not.

17:25.544 --> 17:26.979
I could.
You could not.

17:27.045 --> 17:30.449
The boys don't understand
there's no point in me pulling,

17:30.516 --> 17:34.119
it's too much hassle and I am
enjoying meself with Charlotte.

17:34.186 --> 17:35.454
I'm not gonna pull.

17:40.759 --> 17:45.564
We've just pulled up to the Shire in
a double decker Tash on disco bus.

17:45.631 --> 17:47.866
We definitely don't fit in.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.504
There's no shower on the bus.

17:52.571 --> 17:56.442
I'm gonna have to ask the pub
if I can lend theirs.

17:56.508 --> 18:00.345
Have you got a shower?
Yeah, just up there to the left.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.382
Thank God.
The pub's got a shower I can lend.

18:03.449 --> 18:07.386
At least now I'm not gonna be
smelling of piss. What the hell?

18:11.590 --> 18:13.325
There's no shower gel.

18:15.561 --> 18:18.697
"Don't pour it in your eyes."

18:18.764 --> 18:20.799
OK, that'll do.

18:20.866 --> 18:23.802
Ow, ow, oh, God.

18:28.874 --> 18:32.377
Fuck, I can't run through the pub
in just a towel.

18:32.444 --> 18:36.615
I'll have to take a detour, the long
way through the car park. Shit.

18:42.521 --> 18:43.689
Awkward.

18:44.690 --> 18:45.791
Oh, my God.

18:56.268 --> 19:00.706
Great! The bus is locked and
the driver is nowhere to be seen.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.878
Fuck me, I only nipped into the pub
for a pre-work pint.

19:05.944 --> 19:09.548
I come out Charlotte's naked with
her fanny out. What's going on?

19:11.483 --> 19:14.887
Brilliant, here's James with
a gormless look on his face.

19:14.953 --> 19:19.157
What, James? Have you never seen
a woman in the nig before? Cock.

19:21.326 --> 19:22.995
Can someone open the door?

19:24.930 --> 19:25.931
Oh, God.

19:28.567 --> 19:31.603
Here we go. You get yourself
upstairs, I'll not look.

19:31.670 --> 19:36.875
Fuck. That was traumatic but at
least me vagina is feeling fresh.

19:45.050 --> 19:46.685
Tonight is a big night.

19:46.752 --> 19:50.756
We're bringing Tash on Tours
to farmers so the pressure is on.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.897
I can tell
this isn't gonna go to plan.

19:58.964 --> 20:02.134
For starters,
they already seem pissed.

20:02.200 --> 20:05.571
They know how to drink.
This isn't gonna gaan well.

20:08.840 --> 20:11.777
Fucking hell.
These farmers are absolutely nuts.

20:11.843 --> 20:14.246
We've bitten off
more than we can chew.

20:14.313 --> 20:17.616
Welcome to Tash on Tours.
We're gonna play a couple of games,

20:17.683 --> 20:22.688
we're gonna get pissed. (feedback)
I think you already are.

20:22.754 --> 20:25.357
Vicky's trying to get
these games going

20:25.424 --> 20:27.759
but these farmers
are absolutely nuts.

20:29.928 --> 20:35.067
I'm trying to initiate playing these
games and nobody seems interested.

20:35.133 --> 20:38.370
I feel like Gaz giving a lecture
at a feminist seminar.

20:38.437 --> 20:41.540
No-one's giving us any respect
and no-one gives a shit.

20:41.607 --> 20:43.809
We're gonna play pass the parsnip.

20:46.411 --> 20:49.414
Two lines! Two lines!

20:49.481 --> 20:52.184
I know Charlotte's getting a bit keen

20:52.250 --> 20:55.654
but making everyone else
play with parsnips is weird.

20:55.721 --> 21:00.492
Three, two, one, pass the parsnip.

21:03.729 --> 21:05.964
Guys, no hands.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.303
That's it, encourage your team.
Go on.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.772
This is turning
into a right disaster.

21:13.839 --> 21:17.676
There's only one thing left to do.
Get pissed with the Farmers.

21:28.120 --> 21:32.724
This blonde bird is fucking epic.
I've already to pull meself a daisy

21:32.791 --> 21:34.960
out of all these weeds.

21:37.729 --> 21:40.866
These barn people are crazy.
It's right up my street.

21:40.932 --> 21:43.935
I'm getting amongst this
and amongst this fast.

21:46.471 --> 21:50.375
Nothing is ever innocent
with Gary fucking Beadle.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.010
I could hurt him so much.

21:52.077 --> 21:56.481
I am a bit scared of Charlotte.
I do not wanna piss her of again.

21:56.548 --> 21:59.284
Why did you do it? What-
Don't lie!

21:59.351 --> 22:01.586
She's lost it.
Psycho Charlotte is back.

22:01.653 --> 22:03.822
I fucking hate ya.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.557
Boyfriend club is over.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.026
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

22:10.395 --> 22:10.595
.

22:13.131 --> 22:13.331
.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.206
(country music plays)

22:23.842 --> 22:27.412
The farmers are going absolutely
berserk but I manage to find

22:27.479 --> 22:32.150
one girl that wasn't throwing a drink
over her head and seemed quite sane.

22:34.753 --> 22:38.957
Gary is already flirting with the
most acceptable looking farmer here.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.692
What the hell?

22:49.000 --> 22:54.239
He told me he wouldn't do this, he's
doing it right under me fucking nose

22:54.306 --> 22:56.808
I don't think he'll do anything,
just talking.

23:00.879 --> 23:03.081
This isn't innocent and I know this.

23:03.148 --> 23:07.953
I know all there is to know about
Gary being a flirty fucking prick.

23:14.526 --> 23:16.261
Charlotte is not happy.

23:16.328 --> 23:19.364
I go and tell Gary
and give him the heads up.

23:25.637 --> 23:29.241
I can understand if Charlotte was
going mental if I'd necked on

23:29.307 --> 23:32.744
if I've got this bird's number
but I'm only talking.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.255
Charlotte doesn't need to be
insecure.

23:43.321 --> 23:47.359
I'm allowed to talk to a girl, I'm
not gonna pull her. Just let us talk.

23:58.603 --> 24:02.174
By talking to Gary, I've got meself
into an awkward situation.

24:02.240 --> 24:05.010
I know the shit
is gonna hit the fan.

24:05.076 --> 24:08.613
That's what I used to see every
night. You must have heart of gold.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.017
No, he wouldn't.

24:12.083 --> 24:15.587
Maybe, just maybe,
I am being a little bit crazy.

24:15.654 --> 24:18.723
Just to check I'm gonna send
Marnie over to find out

24:18.790 --> 24:22.327
exactly what was said from the
farmer's horse's mouth itself.

24:31.436 --> 24:36.408
I found out what Gary's said.
Charlotte isn't gonna like this.

24:51.923 --> 24:54.359
Oh, what was that? I was right.

24:54.426 --> 24:59.598
Yes, I know because nothing is ever
innocent with Gary fucking Beadle.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.601
It's happened.
A bout of paranoia was right.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.971
Why? What? Gary was standing,
like, talking to this girl.

25:06.037 --> 25:10.575
Marnie spoke to the girl to ask
what he was saying to her. Right.

25:10.642 --> 25:15.080
Shit. Wait till you hear this. "Do
you wanna come back to the lock-in?"

25:15.146 --> 25:18.817
Right, gets worse. No. "You're
the prettiest girl in this room."

25:18.884 --> 25:20.118
Oh, my God.

25:20.185 --> 25:23.488
I can't believe Gary has done this
in front of Charlotte.

25:23.555 --> 25:26.958
She's not good at controlling
her emotions, Gary knows that.

25:27.025 --> 25:31.897
Do you know what? I'm so angry,
right? I could hurt him so much.

25:31.963 --> 25:35.767
But I'm not gonna do it. Because
I don't even wanna look at him

25:35.834 --> 25:38.637
cos he makes us feel that sick.

25:41.239 --> 25:45.010
I can't even look at Gary,
never mind be in the same room.

25:45.076 --> 25:47.812
I need to get out of here.

25:47.879 --> 25:49.948
What's their crack?

25:50.015 --> 25:52.083
It's just a difficult situation.

25:52.150 --> 25:57.422
You're drunk and you see the lad you
like talking to a girl, that's it.

25:57.489 --> 26:00.292
I can't believe Charlotte's
kicking off this much

26:00.358 --> 26:03.528
but Gary should know
that Charlotte is gonna get angry.

26:03.595 --> 26:05.897
Cos he's treat her like shit
in the past.

26:05.964 --> 26:10.201
There's that thing in your mind when
someone's done something in the past.

26:10.268 --> 26:14.306
That's a dig at me. No, it's not.
Well, yeah, it is a little bit.

26:14.372 --> 26:17.642
The boys can't understand
that when a girl's been mugged off

26:17.709 --> 26:19.811
she feels like
it's gonna happen again.

26:19.878 --> 26:22.814
That's why Charlotte's kicking off
and I'm paranoid.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.416
Every girl's a psycho, Kyle.

26:24.482 --> 26:27.719
Is that your way of telling us
you're a psycho?

26:27.786 --> 26:31.122
I'm not a psycho. (laughs)
Every girl's a psycho.

26:31.189 --> 26:33.024
Gary, go and speak to her.

26:34.392 --> 26:38.496
I am a bit scared of Charlotte,
when she's pissed she's very angry.

26:38.563 --> 26:40.732
I do not wanna piss her off again.

26:41.733 --> 26:45.136
We're all back at the pub and
everyone is absolutely smashed.

26:45.203 --> 26:49.140
It's not easy for you to walk away
from Gaz. Pig life.

26:49.207 --> 26:52.410
I've decided that little,
skinny, pricky rat face

26:52.477 --> 26:55.847
doesn't deserve my tears so I'm
gonna get more pissed instead.

26:59.351 --> 27:02.087
The bird I was talking to
at the hoe down

27:02.153 --> 27:04.556
walks in with all her mates. Fuck.

27:06.291 --> 27:10.261
The lads walk in with that fucking
farm girl and her fucking friends.

27:10.328 --> 27:13.298
Gary, this is one step too far.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.166
Awkward timing.

27:17.602 --> 27:22.140
Charlotte's not only now angry, she's
mortal as well. That is a bad mix.

27:22.207 --> 27:25.276
I'm avoiding the situation
completely. I'm going to bed.

27:32.784 --> 27:35.387
It's a good job Gary's gone to bed

27:35.453 --> 27:40.158
or I'd have put him to sleep with
a rear naked choke hold, bitch.

27:50.869 --> 27:52.904
I do feel sorry for Charlotte.

27:52.971 --> 27:55.974
You'd think they'd learn.
It doesn't work with them.

27:56.041 --> 27:58.643
It's a ticking time bomb
waiting to explode.

27:58.710 --> 28:01.346
All right, let's get amongst it.
(chanting)

28:06.551 --> 28:09.220
That's it,
I can't hold this in any longer

28:09.287 --> 28:12.090
I'm going to blast Gary's head off.

28:14.492 --> 28:15.827
Where you going?

28:15.894 --> 28:20.398
I would not want to be Gary right
now cos Charlotte is going nuts.

28:20.465 --> 28:23.301
Why the fuck did you do that?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.170
WHY?
Do what?

28:25.236 --> 28:27.639
Why? Do what?
Why did you do it?

28:27.705 --> 28:30.008
I spoke to her.
Don't lie, don't lie.

28:30.075 --> 28:35.213
I'm half asleep thinking I'd done the
right thing when Charlotte storms on

28:35.280 --> 28:37.849
and starts going absolutely berserk.

28:37.916 --> 28:40.051
Why did you invite her back?
I didn't.

28:40.118 --> 28:41.886
Yes, you fucking did.

28:41.953 --> 28:45.690
She went "Is there an after party?"
and I went, "Yes, there is."

28:45.757 --> 28:49.260
Don't lie. Don't bother lying.
(Gaz talks) Don't bother lying.

28:49.327 --> 28:52.363
Why make us feel so fucking stupid?
I didn't invite her.

28:52.430 --> 28:57.335
I am furious. This isn't gonna go
unnoticed. Boyfriend club is over.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.905
Why didn't you come
talk to fucking me?

29:00.972 --> 29:05.810
I didn't know if you were drunk.
You made us feel so fucking stupid.

29:05.877 --> 29:08.413
I talked to a girl at work.

29:08.480 --> 29:12.517
Charlotte used to go this mental when
I banged someone or I was necking on,

29:12.584 --> 29:16.621
I only talked to a girl
and she's going even more sick.

29:16.688 --> 29:22.227
You made sure you hugged her before
you left- I don't give a shit!

29:22.293 --> 29:23.962
Why'd you fucking hug her?

29:24.028 --> 29:27.098
She's lost it,
psycho Charlotte is back.

29:27.165 --> 29:28.967
I hate you!

29:29.033 --> 29:31.035
I fucking hate ya.

29:35.974 --> 29:39.377
It upsets me to see Charlotte
like this cos I care about her.

29:39.444 --> 29:43.348
But this time she cannot justify
this behaviour, I've nothing wrong.

29:52.557 --> 29:55.026
I can't believe
how bad tonight has gone

29:55.093 --> 29:59.230
over the smallest, stupidest thing.
Fuck it, I'm going to sleep.

30:03.535 --> 30:06.371
It's only just dawned on us
(sobs) that...

30:06.437 --> 30:09.741
I've just come out
of a serious relationship

30:09.807 --> 30:12.644
with someone who I loved so much

30:12.710 --> 30:15.346
and run back in the arms
of a using prick

30:15.413 --> 30:18.349
who'll never treat us the way
I deserve to be treat.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.084
(shouts)

30:20.718 --> 30:22.187
Feel the love.

30:22.253 --> 30:24.656
Everyone's too pissed
to sort anything out.

30:24.722 --> 30:28.193
It's best we hit the sack
and work this out tomorrow.

30:29.294 --> 30:31.563
Night, Vicks.
See you in the morning.

30:37.135 --> 30:38.503
I don't know what to say.

30:38.570 --> 30:41.139
Why did you hug her when you left?
I didn't. You did.

30:41.206 --> 30:42.540
I'm under examination.

30:42.607 --> 30:46.211
I tried so hard to get on with
everyone but nobody cares.

30:46.277 --> 30:48.580
I don't wanna be here any more.
Fuck!

30:48.646 --> 30:50.348
I'm such a bad friend.

30:50.415 --> 30:54.452
Charlotte and Gary are having sex.
What a scruffy bitch.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.921
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

30:59.190 --> 30:59.390
.

31:01.926 --> 31:02.126
.

31:16.874 --> 31:18.176
Shall we get breakfast?

31:18.243 --> 31:20.545
Woke up,
I feel like a fucking scarecrow.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.915
Back to the pub for a fry-up,
sort this hangover out.

31:25.950 --> 31:27.919
Hi, Vicks.
Hiya.

31:27.986 --> 31:29.821
Are you hung-over?

31:29.887 --> 31:31.289
Yeah.
(belches)

31:31.356 --> 31:35.927
I've got a thumping headache and I'm
still angry at how Gary went on.

31:35.994 --> 31:40.331
I just saw the way they were talking
and I said to you didn't I, Marnie?

31:40.398 --> 31:43.935
We were watching. I went "He keeps
on going over to that girl."

31:44.002 --> 31:48.439
He left her, went back. He wheedles
through the crowd to find her again.

31:48.506 --> 31:52.210
Gary's gonna have to pull miracles
out of his arsehole

31:52.277 --> 31:54.178
to get our friendship back.

31:54.245 --> 31:57.715
I'm not gonna sleep with him
for a while now. OK, pet.

31:59.717 --> 32:03.855
I still can't believe how much
Charlotte kicked off last night.

32:03.921 --> 32:07.525
I didn't shag, but I might as well
cos I got the same grief.

32:12.964 --> 32:14.932
It's the first time Gaz hasn't

32:14.999 --> 32:19.103
done anything wrong and Charlotte is
acting like a spanner, overreacting.

32:19.170 --> 32:23.608
I'm like, "I'm off to bed" and the
girl was there. She walked in there.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.043
I went "See you later."

32:25.109 --> 32:28.546
Charlotte went "You gave her a cuddle
on the way out."

32:28.613 --> 32:31.749
"I walked past her
and went, "I've gotta go."

32:31.816 --> 32:33.217
She was going crackers.

32:33.284 --> 32:36.621
Charlotte kicking off is down
to what I did in the past

32:36.688 --> 32:39.824
but last night I honestly had
no intentions of pulling.

32:39.891 --> 32:42.493
This was always gonna happen
with Charlotte.

32:42.560 --> 32:45.997
It's just the way you and
her are with each other.

32:46.064 --> 32:49.901
I couldn't think of a better way to
finish off wor time in the country

32:49.967 --> 32:53.771
than a nice breakfast but now it's
time to head back to Newcastle.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.809
It doesn't feel like
a happy bus today.

32:57.875 --> 33:01.045
It's a sad bus.
It's the sad awkward bus.

33:01.112 --> 33:02.613
I haven't spoke to Gary,

33:02.680 --> 33:06.884
the longer I've left it the more I
think, what the fuck am I gonna say?

33:06.951 --> 33:09.020
What you gonna do about Gary now?

33:09.087 --> 33:12.323
Well, I think at one point
we'll have to talk.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.404
Back in the hoose.

33:29.273 --> 33:32.677
No more fucking tractors and farms,
we're back in Newcastle,

33:32.744 --> 33:33.811
hitting the town.

33:37.648 --> 33:41.719
The hair's done. The toon's not
gonna know what's hit it tonight.

33:44.122 --> 33:48.626
Tonight should just be all the girls
and no arguments and no drama. Nah.

33:48.693 --> 33:52.563
Shall we go out and have some fun?
(all) Yeah. Let's have some shots.

33:52.630 --> 33:55.933
The girls are back together
and we're gonna fucking smash it.

33:59.303 --> 34:02.306
Tonight I'm gonna have to just
fucking stand with...

34:08.246 --> 34:10.681
Gaz is nervous
about speaking to Charlotte.

34:10.748 --> 34:12.917
Why? You've done nothing wrong.

34:15.652 --> 34:18.656
If the timing's not right
I'll do it tomorrow.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.893
Charlotte had no right to go
absolutely nuts last night.

34:21.958 --> 34:26.764
Talking to her pissed isn't the best
situation but I need to sort it out.

34:26.831 --> 34:30.668
Do it more when she's sober
rather than more pissed.

34:30.735 --> 34:33.103
I'm not gonna lie, I am shitting it.

34:36.474 --> 34:40.411
First night back, guys,
let's have a good one. (cheering)

34:40.478 --> 34:44.882
It's a big night, we're off to House
of Smith. Time to get fucking loose.

34:49.754 --> 34:53.123
We get to House of Smith,
time to get the party started.

35:01.833 --> 35:05.203
I still haven't spoke to Gary
and the longer I'm leaving it,

35:05.269 --> 35:08.873
the more I don't know what to say.
"Sorry, I'm a bunny boiler"?

35:16.414 --> 35:18.382
Last night was an absolute disaster.

35:18.449 --> 35:21.652
Back in Newcastle,
me and Charlotte still haven't spoke.

35:21.719 --> 35:23.888
I need to catch her sober-ish.

35:37.435 --> 35:41.305
Even though I did nothing wrong
I'm still finding myself justifying

35:41.372 --> 35:44.175
me actions to get meself out of it.

35:56.754 --> 36:01.125
OK, I might have taken it a little
bit too far with the crawling thing

36:01.192 --> 36:04.428
but I definitely feel like
he's gotten me point

36:04.495 --> 36:06.931
and there will never be another hug.

36:22.680 --> 36:26.851
I don't know how to feel cos
I'm shocked plus I'm really happy.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.185
This isn't like Gary.

36:37.728 --> 36:42.533
I've prepared meself for this to go
one way and that was to end things.

36:42.600 --> 36:45.269
But Gary's saying
he wants to carry things on.

36:45.336 --> 36:47.772
Well, this has thrown a spanner
in the works.

36:55.346 --> 36:58.182
We sorted everything
but now I'm under examination.

36:58.249 --> 36:59.850
I wanna pass this test

36:59.917 --> 37:03.321
so I'm spending the whole night
on my hands and knees.

37:10.928 --> 37:14.599
I don't know where things stand
with me and Marnie. I'm confused.

37:14.665 --> 37:17.201
I'm finding it hard
to stay mad at her.

37:23.808 --> 37:27.278
We've got a love-hate relationship.
It annoys us that we argue

37:27.345 --> 37:31.415
but he's the only lad who's kept us
on me toes and that's exciting.

37:42.693 --> 37:45.229
I know I've forgiven Marnie
too soon again

37:45.296 --> 37:48.566
but there's something about her
that just draws us back in.

37:58.242 --> 38:01.445
Despite promising that it wasn't
gonna be about necking on

38:01.512 --> 38:04.415
and we're gonna have
some quality girl time,

38:04.482 --> 38:06.951
they haven't actually
spoke to us at all.

38:09.153 --> 38:11.989
I look around
and everyone's in their couples.

38:12.056 --> 38:14.859
The boyfriend club is back on.

38:14.925 --> 38:16.694
Kill it, bitches.

38:20.531 --> 38:22.800
I'm pleased we've sorted
everything out.

38:22.867 --> 38:25.336
Last night feels like
it never happened.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.004
(cheering)
Oh, my God!

38:29.507 --> 38:32.877
To be perfectly honest
I hate boyfriend club,

38:32.943 --> 38:37.348
it's a constant reminder of the fact
that I'm not with me boyfriend.

38:44.655 --> 38:48.125
Vicky's upset. I need to find out
what's going on.

39:01.505 --> 39:04.575
It's horrible seeing Vicky upset
but we're here for her,

39:04.642 --> 39:06.744
we'd never want her
feeling left out.

39:12.383 --> 39:16.320
She looks really upset.
Fuck, I'm such a bad friend.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.427
The girls are thinking
with their vaginas,

39:23.494 --> 39:25.162
they're not bothered about me.

39:25.229 --> 39:27.932
I don't wanna be here any more,
I'm going home.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.043
I'm still missing me boyfriend loads

39:39.110 --> 39:42.880
and I don't know how much longer
I can go on like this.

39:42.947 --> 39:45.049
Hopefully tomorrow'll
be a better day.

39:52.957 --> 39:56.127
There's no place on earth
I'd rather be right now.

39:56.193 --> 39:59.196
Kyle is proving to me
that he's not pulling anybody

39:59.263 --> 40:01.599
and that he might
have respect for me.

40:01.665 --> 40:04.068
I feel like
I'm starting to trust him.

40:10.307 --> 40:13.444
It doesn't take me long
to get a naughty little bird.

40:13.511 --> 40:16.147
You know Saturday's the day
I do the cleaning?

40:16.213 --> 40:17.848
You're about to get dusted.

40:24.688 --> 40:26.857
All the couples are getting on well.

40:26.924 --> 40:31.962
The only problem, there's only one
shag pad so it's rock paper scissors.

40:32.029 --> 40:33.964
One, two, three.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.536
You're out.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.004
One, two, three.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.339
(laughs)

40:42.406 --> 40:44.008
The shag pad!

40:44.074 --> 40:49.246
Shag pad is for shagging, there's
only gonna be one winner, Scotty T.

40:51.749 --> 40:57.054
Everyone's had a wicked night, time
to go home and carry on the fun.

41:07.164 --> 41:09.433
Boyfriend club.
(laughs)

41:13.170 --> 41:15.773
We get back and I'm wasting no time.

41:15.840 --> 41:19.310
I'm heading straight outside
to the shag pad. Wicked.

41:20.811 --> 41:22.379
Marn, what you doing?

41:22.446 --> 41:24.849
I'm getting my bed and Aaron's bed.

41:24.915 --> 41:28.085
Me and Aaron are definitely
sharing a bed tonight.

41:28.152 --> 41:30.054
He isn't escaping my cuddles.

41:31.655 --> 41:36.360
The girls told us to wait downstairs
while they're doing something.

41:36.427 --> 41:39.330
I honestly haven't got a clue
what they're up to.

41:39.396 --> 41:41.565
(laughter)

41:43.067 --> 41:48.038
We're building a kind of boyfriend
club camp in the boys' room.

41:48.105 --> 41:52.843
Moving beds and mattresses...
(grunts) With our bare hands.

41:52.910 --> 41:54.411
Ta-da! (laughs)

41:54.478 --> 41:55.746
Ta-da.

41:55.813 --> 41:57.414
Where's me mattress gone?

41:57.481 --> 42:00.618
The girls are crazy
but it's quite fun everyone being

42:00.684 --> 42:03.220
in the same room.
I feel like a teenager.

42:03.287 --> 42:04.688
Mine looks epic.

42:04.755 --> 42:07.057
(laughter)
Mine looks epic.

42:07.124 --> 42:10.561
We are so mortal
so we take over the boys' room

42:10.628 --> 42:13.664
and make it the official
boyfriend club house.

42:14.665 --> 42:17.968
Marnie climbs on top of us naked.
This is torture.

42:18.035 --> 42:20.638
We can't have sex
with everyone here. Lights out.

42:20.704 --> 42:21.972
Lights out.

42:23.407 --> 42:26.176
I'm not sure that this is acceptable

42:26.243 --> 42:29.680
but I feel like the boyfriend
club camp needs to be christened.

42:43.327 --> 42:44.662
What the hell?

42:44.728 --> 42:48.065
Charlotte and Gary are having sex
in the boyfriend club room.

42:48.132 --> 42:49.767
What a scruffy bitch.

42:52.336 --> 42:54.571
The last few days have been mental.

42:54.638 --> 42:57.241
Me and Charlotte
had the biggest argument ever

42:57.308 --> 43:00.244
but now I'm in a room
with three couples.

43:00.311 --> 43:02.179
What is going on in this house?

43:02.246 --> 43:05.049
(groans)

43:08.385 --> 43:10.454
I need a bit of time to meself.

43:10.521 --> 43:12.222
I didn't see that coming.

43:12.289 --> 43:15.926
He said he didn't wanna pull.
Do not take me for a mug.

43:15.993 --> 43:18.762
You fucking prick.
Go on, I fucking dare you.

43:18.829 --> 43:21.165
What the fuck is going on?
(yells)

43:21.231 --> 43:24.068
She's taking the piss
in front of everyone.

43:24.134 --> 43:26.136
Did he just call me a slut?

43:26.203 --> 43:27.771
It needs to stop now.

43:27.838 --> 43:31.175
Shall we get married?
What? (laughs)

43:31.241 --> 43:33.110
I know he loves us really.

43:58.002 --> 43:58.202
.
