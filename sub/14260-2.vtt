Oh, no, no, no,
this is different.

12:35.722 --> 12:38.055
You'll be in complete charge.

12:38.057 --> 12:39.056
In charge?

12:39.058 --> 12:40.191
That I can handle.

12:45.063 --> 12:47.798
I wonder where Raphael
and Michelangelo wound up.

12:47.800 --> 12:49.133
[whistles]

12:49.135 --> 12:50.601
Try up here, why don'tcha?

12:58.676 --> 13:03.680
Of course, you realize
this is doing absolutely
nothing for my image.

13:03.682 --> 13:05.415
Now let's find Michelangelo.

13:05.417 --> 13:07.885
<i>[video game sounds]</i>
<i>Targeting enemy Sygons.</i>

13:07.887 --> 13:10.520
I think we just did.

13:10.522 --> 13:13.691
And I can't believe he's still
playing with that video game!

13:13.693 --> 13:16.026
Michelangelo, if you don't
give that thing a rest,

13:16.028 --> 13:17.995
I'm going to shut it off
with my katana.

13:17.997 --> 13:20.330
Lighten up, compadres.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.900
I was just killing some
time till you got here.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.535
We've got to find Krang's
robot and shut it down.

13:25.537 --> 13:27.604
I got news, guys.

13:27.606 --> 13:28.939
We're not alone.

13:32.376 --> 13:34.411
Is it that robot dude?

13:34.413 --> 13:36.680
No, it's Rocksteady
and Bebop.

13:36.682 --> 13:40.751
Yo, turtles.
Come out and play.

13:40.753 --> 13:43.554
[All]
Turtle power!

13:45.290 --> 13:47.091
What the-- Ow!

13:47.093 --> 13:50.327
Oh, nothing can save
you now, turtle!

13:50.329 --> 13:52.997
Except the department
of sewers.

13:56.301 --> 13:58.102
Let's get out of here.

13:58.104 --> 13:59.536
We gotta stop them.

13:59.538 --> 14:02.239
They might know why Krang's
body has gone whacko.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.540
This will slow them down.

14:06.044 --> 14:08.211
And I thought coffee was
supposed to keep you awake.

14:08.213 --> 14:10.981
All right, you two,
what's Krang's body doing

14:10.983 --> 14:12.449
running around on its own?

14:12.451 --> 14:15.619
Uh, we don't know
nothing about it.

14:15.621 --> 14:19.222
Yeah, we ain't the ones
who put in the wrong microchip.

14:19.224 --> 14:20.423
Oops.

14:20.425 --> 14:23.794
So that's why the robot
has a mind of its own.

14:23.796 --> 14:27.397
Um, we'd love to stay
and chew the hog fat,

14:27.399 --> 14:29.232
but we gotta run!

14:33.838 --> 14:34.905
They got away.

14:34.907 --> 14:36.340
Forget about them.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.975
We gotta find
that robot body.

14:40.678 --> 14:41.945
Here it is.

14:41.947 --> 14:45.349
The place where you'll
begin your new career.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.917
Attention, happy workers.

14:46.919 --> 14:49.520
I'd like you to meet
your new foreman.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.355
You'll be taking
orders from him.

14:51.357 --> 14:55.692
From some bozo in a tin mask
and a bullfighter's cape?

14:55.694 --> 14:56.927
Heh, fat chance.

14:59.665 --> 15:00.698
Oops.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.366
Some foreman.

15:02.368 --> 15:05.903
Don't youse realize that
everything in here can explode?

15:05.905 --> 15:07.571
That's right.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.806
Including me!

15:19.351 --> 15:20.451
Hmm.

15:20.453 --> 15:22.786
Instead of making mere toys,

15:22.788 --> 15:26.290
I could build something
really dangerous.

15:26.292 --> 15:28.759
Like an explosive device
so powerful,

15:28.761 --> 15:30.594
it will terrorize this city

15:30.596 --> 15:33.864
and force its leader
to succumb to my will.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.367
Don't ask what prompts
me to do this,

15:36.369 --> 15:39.136
it just seems like a good idea.

15:39.138 --> 15:42.306
Seeking enemy space vessels.

15:42.308 --> 15:43.673
Here it comes.

15:43.675 --> 15:45.175
You guys divert
its attention

15:45.177 --> 15:48.111
while I apply
my scientific know-how.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.214
[whistles]
Yo, baldy!

15:50.216 --> 15:51.281
Looking for us?

15:51.283 --> 15:52.916
Enemy sighted.

15:52.918 --> 15:54.352
Alert.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.121
Now, Donatello.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.224
Hurry up, we can't hold this

16:00.226 --> 16:02.826
bucking bag of bolts
much longer.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.128
Here goes.

16:16.574 --> 16:19.009
Oh, what the heck did
you do to that thing?

16:19.011 --> 16:22.346
Well, it looks like
I made a small error.

16:22.348 --> 16:23.780
Wrong, dude.

16:23.782 --> 16:26.383
You made a
humungazoid error.

16:29.621 --> 16:30.988
Nice going, Donatello.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.456
You've just created

16:32.458 --> 16:34.858
an extra-large
economy-size problem.

16:38.629 --> 16:40.164
Zone cleared.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.500
Advance to next level.

16:42.502 --> 16:45.435
I must have triggered its
size transformation actuator.

16:45.437 --> 16:48.072
Yo, I wouldn't brag
about it if I were you.

16:53.244 --> 16:56.179
Didn't I see this once
in a demolition derby?

17:01.186 --> 17:02.652
Holy guacamole!

17:02.654 --> 17:04.088
It shrunk.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.190
Quick, Donatello.  Grab it.

17:06.192 --> 17:10.492
But now it's too small for me
to get inside and shut down.

17:10.494 --> 17:11.627
Uh-oh.

17:12.597 --> 17:15.598
This yo-yo is starting
to act like a yo-yo.

17:21.172 --> 17:23.406
[Krang]
I don't believe this.

17:23.409 --> 17:26.210
First my body loses its mind,

17:26.212 --> 17:27.411
then Shredder.

17:27.413 --> 17:28.612
Who's next?

17:28.614 --> 17:30.047
Bebop and Rocksteady?

17:32.384 --> 17:35.519
My super explosive
device is complete.

17:35.521 --> 17:39.690
With it, I can put the entire
city under my control.

17:39.692 --> 17:40.757
Whoever I am.

17:43.228 --> 17:45.062
I've been searching
the city all night,

17:45.064 --> 17:47.598
and no sign
of that runaway robot.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.633
I'll never scoop April
at this rate.

17:49.635 --> 17:52.002
Wait. There's City Hall.

17:52.004 --> 17:55.306
If some robot monster is trying
to take over the city,

17:55.308 --> 17:57.575
sooner or later he's bound
to wind up there.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.480
Look! It's shrinking
down again.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.348
It's obviously not
wash-and-wear.

18:06.952 --> 18:08.419
Grab him!

18:09.787 --> 18:11.855
Now to terminate
this thing for keeps.

18:14.926 --> 18:17.161
Oh, no.  Here we go again.

18:18.596 --> 18:21.298
This situation is really
getting out of hand.

18:21.300 --> 18:24.901
Enemy sighted.
3,000 bonus points.

18:24.903 --> 18:27.004
Michelangelo,
will you cool it

18:27.006 --> 18:28.739
with that stupid
video game?

18:28.741 --> 18:31.041
My video game didn't
say that, bud.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.676
That thing did.

18:32.678 --> 18:35.579
Entering Saurian
Nebula of Doom.

18:35.581 --> 18:39.649
Whoa, it talks just like
my <i> Space Trek</i> game.

18:39.651 --> 18:42.886
Now I know what Rocksteady
was babbling about.

18:42.888 --> 18:45.589
They must have put a video
game chip in that thing.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.791
Whoa!
Yow!

18:52.530 --> 18:54.431
[Turtles]
Whoa! Wah!

18:58.503 --> 19:00.170
There's gotta be
a less painful way

19:00.172 --> 19:02.139
to reach out
and touch someone.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.441
Hey, look.  There's Shredder.

19:04.443 --> 19:08.278
If the city doesn't turn all
power over to me immediately,

19:08.280 --> 19:10.714
I'll blow this
building sky high.

19:10.716 --> 19:12.716
Not so fast, tin grin.

19:12.718 --> 19:15.186
Who in blazes are you freaks?

19:15.188 --> 19:16.820
Don't you recognize us?

19:16.822 --> 19:21.025
We're those lovable,
wise-cracking Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.160
I never saw you
before in my life.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.162
Well, you're seeing
us know, Shredder.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.463
Shredder?

19:26.465 --> 19:28.698
Is that what I call myself?

19:28.700 --> 19:30.000
What a ridiculous name.

19:30.002 --> 19:33.070
It looks like old chrome dome
has lost his memory.

19:33.072 --> 19:36.173
Yeah, but he's still got
his same old evil instincts.

19:36.175 --> 19:40.110
Why? Just because he's planning
to blow up City Hall.

19:40.112 --> 19:42.312
[Turtles]
Turtles fight with honor!

19:42.314 --> 19:44.714
Don't move, whoever you are.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.884
Or I'll use this
triggering device

19:46.886 --> 19:49.052
to blow us all
to kingdom come.

19:49.054 --> 19:51.154
This is Vernon Fenwick

19:51.156 --> 19:52.789
with an on-the-spot
interview

19:52.791 --> 19:54.891
with that arch villain
known as Shredder.

19:54.893 --> 19:56.293
I am called Shredder.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.161
Tell us, do you think

19:58.163 --> 20:00.130
the Mets will win
the pennant this year?

20:00.132 --> 20:03.234
Get that thing out
of my face, you idiot.

20:06.737 --> 20:09.873
The turtles!
You wretched reptiles!

20:09.875 --> 20:12.475
Uh-oh, he's
his old self again.

20:12.477 --> 20:14.611
Nice going, Vernon.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.314
You just gave Shredder
his memory back.

20:17.316 --> 20:19.283
And guess what else is back.

20:23.187 --> 20:24.955
At least it's getting
smaller again.

20:24.957 --> 20:28.091
Vernon,
keep an eye on Shredder.

20:28.093 --> 20:29.660
Don't move.

20:29.662 --> 20:30.994
Pretty please?

20:30.996 --> 20:32.830
Entering Level 15.

20:32.832 --> 20:36.567
Wow. And I though Michelangelo
had video games on the brain.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.003
Dude, you just gave me
one gnarly notion.

20:42.139 --> 20:43.607
Gotcha.

20:43.609 --> 20:45.775
[beeping]

20:45.777 --> 20:46.876
All right.

20:46.878 --> 20:50.180
Cowabunga!

20:53.618 --> 20:57.053
Salute your new masters,
robot dude.

20:57.055 --> 20:59.889
Michelangelo,
how did you do that?

20:59.891 --> 21:01.992
Piece of cake, dude.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.361
I just connected it
to my video game.

21:04.363 --> 21:06.530
My joystick controls it now.

21:08.132 --> 21:10.267
Later, amigos!

21:12.136 --> 21:15.105
Who dares tie up
the mighty Shredder?

21:15.107 --> 21:17.608
Oh, it wasn't me, sir.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.476
Please, please don't hurt me.

21:22.913 --> 21:25.915
Okay, flesh face, [snort]
beat it.

21:25.917 --> 21:28.152
Oh, whatever you say.

21:28.154 --> 21:29.986
<i>Ciao</i> for now.

21:29.988 --> 21:32.823
Wow, are we glad
to see you.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.459
Yeah,
we've been looking
all over for you.

21:35.461 --> 21:38.228
Out of my way,
you dunderheads.

21:38.230 --> 21:42.633
It's time to blow those
turtles back to the pet shop.

21:42.635 --> 21:43.634
Uh-oh.

21:43.636 --> 21:46.436
Too late, shred head.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.571
Now, put that thing
somewhere safe.

21:51.642 --> 21:54.577
Blast it. I can't
detonate the device now.

21:54.579 --> 21:58.081
It would blow up
Krang's robot body.

21:58.083 --> 21:59.916
Oh, no.  It's
starting to shrink.

21:59.918 --> 22:02.919
Quick, Michelangelo.
Get down off there.

22:02.921 --> 22:04.788
No sweat, dudes.

22:12.731 --> 22:15.532
Man!  Talk about a
bad case of heartburn.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.538
My beautiful body!

22:21.540 --> 22:22.739
Ruined!

22:22.741 --> 22:25.341
And it's all your
fault, Shredder.

22:25.343 --> 22:30.547
You just better hope the damage
is covered by the warranty!

22:30.549 --> 22:32.015
<i>[April]</i>
<i>Fortunately,</i>

22:32.017 --> 22:34.250
<i>the rampaging robot</i>

<i>by the Teenage Mutant</i>

22:43.495 --> 22:46.229
We owe it all to you,
Michelangelo.

22:46.231 --> 22:48.365
Your video game
really saved our shells.

22:48.367 --> 22:50.600
You go right on
playing that thing.

22:50.602 --> 22:52.236
Oh, awesome!

22:52.238 --> 22:56.039
Now, let's see if I
can make it to level 76.

22:56.041 --> 22:56.940
[video game sounds]

22:56.942 --> 22:57.907
[beeping]

23:00.678 --> 23:02.312
Now how about that?

23:02.314 --> 23:04.081
He finally hit overload.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.882
Bummer, dudes.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.251
And I could've been
a contender.
