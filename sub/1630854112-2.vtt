09:20.060 --> 09:21.876
Our backyard accident

We've apprehended a suspect.

09:24.623 --> 09:26.472
How can you--?

09:26.625 --> 09:30.460
All LAFD personnel are sworn

09:30.462 --> 09:32.312

09:33.465 --> 09:36.700
You've learned two things today.

09:56.579 --> 09:59.823
Mama, the car's
still in the house.

09:59.841 --> 10:02.659
Your father will deal
with it when he gets home.

10:02.752 --> 10:05.178
Mama, you do realize
that Daddy is not coming home

10:05.330 --> 10:07.497
-for a while.
-Don't be ridiculous.

10:07.590 --> 10:08.832
He'll be fine.

10:08.850 --> 10:10.183
I'll go get your room ready.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.835
Would you rather
we stay in a hotel?

10:11.928 --> 10:13.278
Maybe you should.

10:13.505 --> 10:17.173
-Mama!
-Well, nobody asked you
to invade my home.

10:17.266 --> 10:20.267
I haven't pulled
that trundle bed out in years.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.178
Maybe your big,
strong fireman can do it.

10:22.197 --> 10:24.197
-Mama, I swear...
-It-It's okay.

10:24.349 --> 10:26.374
It's okay. Beatrice,
we'll set ourselves up.

10:27.610 --> 10:30.353
I do not know
what is in her head.

10:30.446 --> 10:33.539
Well, her world did just
crash down around her.

10:34.283 --> 10:36.542
Well, this does look worse
than I thought.

10:36.695 --> 10:38.285
But I can get
the car out of there,

10:38.305 --> 10:40.305
board up the windows.
We will need to contact

10:40.532 --> 10:42.641
-a contractor...
-That we have.

10:42.792 --> 10:44.033
Old family friend.

10:44.127 --> 10:45.292
I think he's still
their handyman.

10:45.312 --> 10:48.313
You think you can get
this car out of here

10:48.464 --> 10:49.706
by yourself?

10:49.799 --> 10:51.691
Big, strong fireman.

10:56.731 --> 10:58.639
What are you reading, Buck?

10:58.659 --> 11:00.307
Oh, it's, uh, it's Bobby's.

11:01.144 --> 11:03.644
Oh, are you trying
to tell us something?

11:03.738 --> 11:05.571
Um, no, he just, he told me

11:05.666 --> 11:07.982
about this idea in AA.
I took it upon myself

11:08.001 --> 11:10.985
to, you know,
dig a little deeper.

11:11.062 --> 11:14.339
Hey, can...
can I ask you something?

11:15.342 --> 11:16.582
Sure.

11:16.735 --> 11:17.901
Are you at ease?

11:17.919 --> 11:20.679
Do I look
like I'm at ease, Buck?

11:20.830 --> 11:23.740
No, sorry, wrong question.
It's just in-in the book,

11:23.758 --> 11:26.000
it says that if I'm at ease,

11:26.094 --> 11:29.913
"all my fear will fall
away from me."

11:29.931 --> 11:32.807
Well, let me know
how that works out.

11:32.859 --> 11:35.360
Yes, sir,
I hear the sirens, too.

11:35.511 --> 11:37.678
You're welcome.

11:37.772 --> 11:40.273
What did we say about lurking,
Noah?

11:40.425 --> 11:42.275
Sorry.

11:42.427 --> 11:44.277
I just wanted to thank you.

11:44.429 --> 11:47.521
For saving me, you know,
when I crashed and burned.

11:47.615 --> 11:50.208
You didn't do
either of those things.

11:50.359 --> 11:52.377
Today you learned
how the element of surprise

11:52.528 --> 11:55.605
-can refocus
a caller's attention.
-And if that doesn't work?

11:55.698 --> 11:57.123
Try singing to them.

11:57.292 --> 12:00.719
There was this guy who went off
Mulholland into the ravine.

12:00.795 --> 12:02.795
And I had to sing a few bars

12:02.889 --> 12:04.371
of the Thompson Twins'
"Hold Me Now."

12:04.466 --> 12:07.116
It was playing on his radio,
and by hearing me sing it...

12:07.135 --> 12:08.876
It got him to pay attention.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.787
I wish I could listen
to more calls.

12:10.805 --> 12:12.305
Didn't they give you samples
at the academy?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.290
I already listened to all of
them. Also I'm pretty sure

12:14.383 --> 12:16.050
they were as old
as the Thompson Twins.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.736
Okay, uh...

12:17.963 --> 12:19.963
If you want
some more recent calls,

12:19.981 --> 12:21.939
just check out the active logs.

12:22.016 --> 12:24.725
-Put in your ID number and...
-All the calls
I could ever want.

12:24.819 --> 12:25.910
Awesome.

12:26.062 --> 12:27.971
I promise I won't play
the one of you singing.

12:27.989 --> 12:30.373

12:41.577 --> 12:43.595

13:05.677 --> 13:08.194
-if you get
into your third year, right?
-That is correct.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.604
So why did you agree
to become captain?

13:10.624 --> 13:13.850

23:19.732 --> 23:21.565
(electricity crackling)

23:21.717 --> 23:23.809
Buck, Chim, you're with him.

23:23.961 --> 23:27.554
Eddie, Julie,
you get these two.

23:27.648 --> 23:29.815
(victims coughing)

23:29.967 --> 23:32.993
Let's get these people
to the treatment area.

23:36.657 --> 23:38.140
(pained groaning)

23:38.233 --> 23:41.067
Ronny, Angelo, I'm Eddie,
this is Julie.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.163
Nice when the bodies are
already tagged, eh, Julie?

23:44.315 --> 23:47.240
Oh, would you shut your trap,
Ange, for once?

23:47.334 --> 23:48.651
Can you both feel your legs?

23:48.669 --> 23:51.153
-More than I'd like.
-Where the hell is Lev?

23:51.172 --> 23:53.155
Is he okay? Lev!

23:53.174 --> 23:55.841
-Kind of in the middle
of something.
-(Angelo groans)

23:55.993 --> 23:57.918
I guess under
the middle of something.

23:57.937 --> 24:01.513
Vitals holding. Let's run
two lines on him, wide open.

24:01.666 --> 24:03.849
(device beeping)

24:04.001 --> 24:05.109
I can't feel anything.

24:05.260 --> 24:07.111
-Is that bad?
-Not necessarily.

24:07.262 --> 24:09.521
Could be some swelling
that's causing the numbness.

24:09.674 --> 24:11.282
Let me take a look.

24:15.029 --> 24:17.455
Uh, hey, so you guys were
attending

24:17.606 --> 24:18.622
the convention together?

24:18.849 --> 24:20.516
Post-retirement boys' trip.

24:20.685 --> 24:23.276
And here I thought everyone just
took up golf when they retired.

24:23.296 --> 24:26.855
-Oh, do not say it.
-I told you so.

24:26.874 --> 24:28.281
Oh, God, he says it.

24:28.301 --> 24:29.967
Seems like you guys have
known each other for a while.

24:30.118 --> 24:32.878
-Ever since sixth grade.
-That's nice.

24:33.030 --> 24:34.454
That you guys have
stayed close this long.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.031
I'd like to be less close
right now,

24:36.050 --> 24:37.700
if you don't mind.
(grunts)

24:37.793 --> 24:39.885
(groans)
Can you move this thing?

24:40.037 --> 24:44.223
All right.
But it is gonna hurt.

24:44.391 --> 24:46.025
(groaning)

24:49.489 --> 24:51.739
All right, ready?

24:52.733 --> 24:54.399
On three.

24:54.494 --> 24:57.244
One, two, three.

24:58.055 --> 25:00.080
(Angelo cries out)

25:02.168 --> 25:05.652
Put it back!
(crying out)

25:05.746 --> 25:08.088
-What happened?
-(Angelo groans)

25:09.083 --> 25:11.675
Your fibula's punctured
his thigh.

25:11.827 --> 25:13.235
Hit a major artery.

25:13.328 --> 25:16.421
Are we gonna be okay?

25:16.590 --> 25:19.683
Yeah. They're in great hands,
and you're next.

25:19.835 --> 25:21.760
Okay. Those two...

25:21.854 --> 25:25.356
will kill each other
without me.

25:25.583 --> 25:26.690
Uh, Lev, hey, hey.

25:26.842 --> 25:28.692
You, uh, you never told me why.

25:28.844 --> 25:30.176
Why a happiness convention, huh?

25:30.196 --> 25:32.755
Trying to figure out
some stuff.

25:32.773 --> 25:35.682
Thought maybe we'd find
an answer here.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.609
You-you guys weren't happy?

25:37.762 --> 25:38.852
You live your whole life,

25:38.946 --> 25:41.855
doing everything
you're supposed to.

25:41.949 --> 25:43.932
Marriage, kids.

25:43.951 --> 25:47.770
Big house, nice cars.

25:47.863 --> 25:50.105
Weekends at the shore.

25:50.198 --> 25:53.108
Hey, that, uh, doesn't sound
too bad, right?

25:53.201 --> 25:53.942
It wasn't.

25:54.036 --> 25:57.780
It's just this 40-year blur.

25:57.798 --> 26:01.450
Work and family.

26:01.468 --> 26:03.710
Never enough time.

26:03.729 --> 26:06.397
Until one day work stops,

26:06.624 --> 26:10.050
and everything finally
comes into focus.

26:10.069 --> 26:13.720
You're not sure what
you're looking at.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.648
What was the point of...

26:16.742 --> 26:19.368
any of it?

26:22.139 --> 26:24.139
I'm here, sir.
Are you able to speak up?

26:24.141 --> 26:26.250
-What's your name?
<i> -Frankie. I'm trapped.</i>

26:26.477 --> 26:27.918
<i> NOAH: Do you know</i>
<i> your address, Frankie?</i>

26:28.070 --> 26:30.479
I'm at the WestPlex
Convention Center.

26:30.497 --> 26:32.314
We've got a team
on scene, Frankie.

26:32.407 --> 26:33.924
<i> I think I'm too buried.</i>

26:34.076 --> 26:35.909
I was up top moving some chairs

26:36.003 --> 26:37.377
when it all came
crashing down.

26:37.488 --> 26:40.322
Captain 118, we've got
another victim on scene.

26:40.341 --> 26:42.841
<i> His name is Frankie.</i>
<i> Says he's completely buried.</i>

26:42.993 --> 26:45.060
(indistinct chatter)

26:46.664 --> 26:48.105
Dispatch, need help
finding a location.

26:48.256 --> 26:51.358
He says he was moving some
chairs from the ballroom.

26:59.526 --> 27:00.934
(grunts)

27:01.028 --> 27:04.179
Frankie!
Where are you hurt?

27:04.198 --> 27:06.123
-Hard to breathe.
-Hang in there, Frankie.

27:06.274 --> 27:08.033
-(whimpers)
-We got him!
-Yeah!

27:08.127 --> 27:11.045
-We're coming to get you.
-(sobs)

27:11.797 --> 27:13.038
No distal pulse on Angelo.

27:13.190 --> 27:15.040
Normally we travel you
with a foreign object,

27:15.134 --> 27:17.968
-but in this case,
the object is your friend.
-So what do we do?

27:18.120 --> 27:21.213
Pull you apart very carefully.

27:21.307 --> 27:24.141
Dispatch, the victim's showing
signs of a punctured lung.

27:24.368 --> 27:27.478
We've already got two
complicated rescues in progress.

27:27.705 --> 27:28.795
133 is already en route.

27:28.814 --> 27:31.315
The 133 will be there
in 12 minutes.

27:33.544 --> 27:34.985
I just, I don't have
enough hands

27:35.212 --> 27:36.561
to get them both out
right now,

27:36.730 --> 27:38.155
and I need the hydraulic jack
for the kid.

27:38.306 --> 27:41.307
Most likely, Lev has already
bled out internally,

27:41.327 --> 27:42.551
and that slab of concrete's

27:42.644 --> 27:44.144
acting as a clamp,
keeping him alive.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.664
We lift it, most likely
he dies anyway.

27:46.891 --> 27:49.208
Kid's got a better shot.

27:56.825 --> 27:59.918
-Hey, Lev...
-Hey.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.137
You ready to get this thing
off of me?

28:04.016 --> 28:05.999
There's a kid buried
over there.

28:06.018 --> 28:09.228
I think he's got
a punctured lung.

28:10.931 --> 28:12.338
I-I need to get him
out of there.

28:12.433 --> 28:15.984
And you don't have
enough guys.

28:17.938 --> 28:20.847
You get that kid out.

28:20.941 --> 28:22.774
I ain't going nowhere.

28:22.868 --> 28:24.535
Go help the kid.

28:24.686 --> 28:26.245
Buck.

28:28.949 --> 28:31.283
Help me with this.

28:31.435 --> 28:33.043
(grunts)

28:34.362 --> 28:36.438
-(hydraulic jack whining)
-Are you guys clear?

28:36.457 --> 28:38.790
I always thought it was Lev
that kept us together.

28:38.867 --> 28:41.944
(pained groaning)

28:42.037 --> 28:43.946
(groaning continues)

28:44.039 --> 28:46.039
All right, pull him out.

28:46.133 --> 28:47.632
BUCK:
All right, get him
on the backboard.

28:47.727 --> 28:49.952
One, two, three.

28:50.120 --> 28:52.730
(Angelo, Ronny crying out)

29:01.298 --> 29:03.148

-EDDIE: Ready, yeah.

29:03.242 --> 29:04.658
Up.

29:07.154 --> 29:09.654
Three, two, up.

29:09.749 --> 29:11.656
BUCK:
We got him. We got him.

29:11.809 --> 29:13.976
-They saved the kid?
-Yeah.

29:14.069 --> 29:16.812
And you're next.
You're next, Lev.

29:16.830 --> 29:19.906
It's okay.

29:20.000 --> 29:23.051
I got what I came for.

29:25.656 --> 29:28.432
I think I get it now.

29:28.583 --> 29:30.893
(monitor flatlines)

29:31.829 --> 29:33.270
Get him out.
Get him out now!

Mm. Sure.

31:18.936 --> 31:22.713
There's an old orange grove
out there.

31:22.789 --> 31:24.940
Out past the woods.

31:24.958 --> 31:27.200
Where the bonfires happened

31:27.294 --> 31:30.295
when we all hung out
in high school.

31:30.447 --> 31:33.390
When I was a little girl,

31:33.617 --> 31:34.799
Daddy and I would
go out there

31:34.894 --> 31:36.894
every Saturday morning,

31:37.045 --> 31:40.122
grab oranges and tangerines

31:40.140 --> 31:41.973
that had fallen from the trees.

31:42.067 --> 31:45.218
Bring 'em home,
make fresh juice,

31:45.312 --> 31:50.815
pour it over ice and sit,
right here. (chuckles)

31:50.910 --> 31:54.302
I would sit on his lap.

31:54.396 --> 31:57.230
He would tell me stories
about the family,

31:57.399 --> 32:01.609
about all the great things
that the Carters had done.

32:01.662 --> 32:04.237
Daddy was an attorney,

32:04.256 --> 32:08.074
but his daddy
had been one, too.

32:08.093 --> 32:11.836
First Negro lawyer
to pass the Florida bar.

32:11.931 --> 32:15.248
Even graduated from A&M
just like him.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.434
And that's what made you
want to be a lawyer.

32:17.585 --> 32:20.020
Oh, it did.

32:20.922 --> 32:22.998
And when I left for California,

32:23.091 --> 32:25.167
oh, he couldn't have
been prouder.

32:25.185 --> 32:30.689
Told me to spread my wings,
do great things.

32:30.841 --> 32:32.507
And what did Beatrice say?

32:32.526 --> 32:35.844
"Do not drink that juice,
it has not been pasteurized."

32:35.862 --> 32:37.746
(Bobby chuckles)

32:38.791 --> 32:41.458
Daddy was always the comfort.

32:41.609 --> 32:44.294
Mama was the reality.

32:45.372 --> 32:48.781
I'm not sure I'm ready
to lose the comfort.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.968
You haven't lost him yet.

32:52.529 --> 32:57.391
You know the worst part of
having to parent your parents?

32:58.811 --> 33:00.644
It's knowing that you're
that much closer

33:00.871 --> 33:03.105
to losing them.

33:14.067 --> 33:16.159
Hey, uh, we're gonna grab
some breakfast.

33:16.311 --> 33:18.978
A little grub might
hit the spot.

33:18.998 --> 33:22.724
Uh, not for me.
Not today.

33:22.743 --> 33:24.743
Fair enough.

33:24.895 --> 33:27.078
I gotta pass.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.397
Copy that. Well-we'll be
at the diner on Alvarado

33:29.416 --> 33:31.717
if you guys want to join us.

33:44.339 --> 33:48.984
Hey, um, what...
What do you think he meant?

33:50.029 --> 33:52.270
You know, he said,
"I get it now."

33:52.422 --> 33:55.090
And his eyes got all bright,
and he looked up to the sky

33:55.108 --> 33:57.108
like he'd just found happiness.

33:57.261 --> 33:58.351
I was there, Buck.

33:58.370 --> 33:59.685
It was like he solved this...

33:59.780 --> 34:01.538
this great mystery,

34:01.689 --> 34:03.749
and then he died
before he could share it.

34:07.287 --> 34:12.532
Hey, losing someone
out there is never easy.

34:12.551 --> 34:15.443
Uh-huh. Yeah.

34:15.462 --> 34:16.386
To a design flaw.

34:16.613 --> 34:20.131
I, uh, saw it
on the news last night.

34:20.208 --> 34:22.801
The hotel put in that walkway
a couple years ago

34:22.953 --> 34:26.212
and tried to sue the contractor
after they found some cracks

34:26.306 --> 34:27.305
but the repairs just...

34:27.399 --> 34:29.291
Fell through the same cracks.

34:29.309 --> 34:31.476
It was bound to come
crashing down.

34:31.628 --> 34:35.888
But not before Nathan Levinson
learned the secret, right?

34:35.908 --> 34:39.634
Maybe that's what
we should focus on.

34:39.727 --> 34:42.304
-He found it before he died.
-What, so he,

34:42.472 --> 34:44.581
he spent his whole life
trying to figure it out,

34:44.732 --> 34:48.043
and then he finally gets
the answer right at the end?

34:49.146 --> 34:52.238
What, uh, what do you
think it is?

34:52.257 --> 34:54.407
The secret to happiness.

34:54.426 --> 34:56.668
(scoffs)

34:56.762 --> 34:58.637
I mean, Hen...

35:00.157 --> 35:02.599
...you-you always
have the answers.

35:02.750 --> 35:04.326
(chuckles softly)

35:04.344 --> 35:07.229
Some answers you gotta
find on your own, Buck.

35:08.923 --> 35:12.025
(phone ringing, vibrating)

35:15.339 --> 35:17.114
Hello?

35:17.265 --> 35:22.035
Hi, Dr. Simmons.
This is a surprise.

35:39.379 --> 35:41.379
Good morning.

35:41.456 --> 35:43.365
Hey.

35:44.459 --> 35:47.886

you had to let something go,
