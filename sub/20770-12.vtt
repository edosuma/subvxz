WEBVTT

01:47.066 --> 01:48.859
Thank God Gordon
stocks the plane

01:48.984 --> 01:50.653
from his own wine cellar.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.780
No, you'll be
the one to tell her.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.701
Ignore the strange man.

02:04.959 --> 02:07.002
- Here's to the bureau.
- To the bureau.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.170
To the bureau.

02:16.345 --> 02:17.471
Albert.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.014
Gordon.

02:22.101 --> 02:24.436
Okay, here's what
you need to know.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.816
Please speak succinctly,

02:28.941 --> 02:33.779
and do not make any loud,
sharp noises.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.788
In 1970,
the United States Air Force

02:42.913 --> 02:45.374
shut down Project Blue Book,

02:45.499 --> 02:48.961
their 20-year investigation
into UFOs.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.797
They concluded that
no credible evidence existed

02:51.922 --> 02:54.675
and therefore they posed
no threat to national security.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.511
In other words,
a massive cover-up.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.555
- Cheers.
- Hmm.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.473
Cheers.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.859
A few years later,
the military and FBI

03:11.984 --> 03:13.986
formed a top secret task force

03:14.111 --> 03:16.071
to explore
the troubling abstractions

03:16.197 --> 03:19.700
raised by cases
Blue Book failed to resolve.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.827
We called it the Blue Rose
after a phrase

03:21.952 --> 03:23.954
uttered by a woman
in one of these cases

03:24.079 --> 03:25.956
just before she died

03:26.081 --> 03:28.626
which suggested these answers
could not be reached

03:28.751 --> 03:32.087
except by an alternate path
we've been traveling ever since.

03:33.047 --> 03:35.716
Gordon suggested an agent
by the name of Phillip Jeffries

03:35.841 --> 03:36.926
to head the squad.

03:37.051 --> 03:39.011
He soon recruited three others:

03:39.136 --> 03:42.056
myself, Chet Desmond,
and Dale Cooper.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.934
Perhaps you haven't
failed to notice

03:45.059 --> 03:46.644
that I'm the only one
of that group

03:46.769 --> 03:49.271
who hasn't disappeared
without explanation,

03:49.396 --> 03:51.941
which has led to a certain
reluctance on Gordon's part

03:52.066 --> 03:54.693
to bring new blood
into the fold...

03:54.818 --> 03:56.111
until tonight.

04:00.324 --> 04:02.534
Agent Preston,

04:02.660 --> 04:04.119
you've been on our radar

04:04.245 --> 04:07.122
since you made the honors list
at George Washington High,

04:07.248 --> 04:09.541
not to mention
the dean's list at MIT

04:09.667 --> 04:11.794
and top of your class
at Quantico.

04:18.676 --> 04:21.762
You're asking me to join
the Blue Rose task force.

04:26.058 --> 04:26.892
Yep.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.064
I'm in.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.777
I'll brief you in detail
in the morning.

04:38.112 --> 04:39.446
Okay.

04:49.248 --> 04:51.333
To Tammy and the Blue Rose.

04:53.585 --> 04:54.420
The Blue Rose.

04:54.545 --> 04:55.379
The Blue Rose.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.745
Diane's on her way.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.221
Have a seat, Diane.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.519
Care for a drink?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.647
I like it on the rocks.

05:55.773 --> 05:57.191
Well, you're in luck.

05:58.942 --> 06:01.070
The Dakotas are still
in the Ice Age.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.814
Diane,

06:36.939 --> 06:39.024
we know your work
with Agent Cooper has given you

06:39.149 --> 06:41.777
more than a passing insight
into the Blue Rose.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.987
Even though you're no longer
a part of the bureau,

06:44.113 --> 06:45.781
we'd like to deputize you.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.825
On a temporary basis,

06:47.950 --> 06:49.910
because we really need
your help.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.128
What's in it for me?

06:59.253 --> 07:00.587
Some cash.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.755
Not much.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.009
Maybe the satisfaction
of learning what happened

07:06.135 --> 07:07.428
to your friend Cooper.

07:29.450 --> 07:30.784
Let's rock.

07:58.479 --> 07:59.521
Ah!

08:48.862 --> 08:52.199
Uh, could I have a carton
of Salems, please?

09:22.396 --> 09:23.981
How much is it?

09:24.106 --> 09:25.440
$133.70.

09:33.115 --> 09:36.618
I don't remember seeing
those beef jerky there before.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.039
Uh, that's new.

09:41.164 --> 09:43.333
What type is it?

09:43.458 --> 09:46.003
Uh, it's turkey, not beef.

09:48.839 --> 09:51.300
Is it smoked?

09:51.425 --> 09:54.136
Uh, I-I think so.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.929
It's the same as beef jerky,

09:56.054 --> 09:58.515
except it's made from turkey.

10:05.480 --> 10:08.191
Were you here
when they first came?

10:08.317 --> 10:10.319
Uh, yes.

10:10.444 --> 10:12.487
They brought it in
a couple weeks ago.

10:13.822 --> 10:16.199
Your room seems different.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.786
And men are coming.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.414
Uh, I'm...

10:22.539 --> 10:24.374
I'm‒I'm not sure I know
what you mean.

10:24.499 --> 10:26.668
I am trying to tell you

10:26.793 --> 10:28.754
that you have to watch out!

10:30.464 --> 10:32.007
Things can happen!

10:34.176 --> 10:36.053
Something happened to me.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.262
Hmm?

10:38.472 --> 10:40.432
Something happened to me!

10:40.557 --> 10:43.143
I don't feel good.
I don't feel good.

10:44.686 --> 10:46.188
I don't feel good.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.815
I don't feel good!

10:48.940 --> 10:50.400
Um...

10:50.525 --> 10:51.860
Sarah.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.320
Sarah, s-stop doing this.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.530
Should‒should I call a doctor?

10:55.656 --> 10:57.115
Stop doing this.
Stop doing this.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.201
Okay. Leave this place.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.913
Find the car key.
Find the car key.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.083
Get the car key.

11:06.208 --> 11:09.294
Get the car‒
get the goddamn car key!

11:14.883 --> 11:16.468
What?

11:18.679 --> 11:19.554
I...

11:20.430 --> 11:21.556
I know where she lives.

11:21.682 --> 11:24.184
I can d-deliver them.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.687
I guess.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.125
Kriscol.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.345
I want to ask you something.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.763
You been selling
your blood again?

12:03.223 --> 12:04.433
Yes, sir.

12:05.976 --> 12:09.104
Now, Kriscol, did you install
a new propane tank

12:09.229 --> 12:10.856
for Jenkins last week?

12:10.981 --> 12:11.857
Yes, sir.

12:11.982 --> 12:13.608
Did you get paid for that?

12:13.734 --> 12:15.110
No, sir.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.987
Do you mow lawns around here

12:17.112 --> 12:18.488
and rake up?

12:18.613 --> 12:19.865
Yes, sir.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.241
Do you get paid for that?

12:22.075 --> 12:23.076
No, sir.

12:25.287 --> 12:26.872
Okay, Kriscol.

12:27.914 --> 12:31.126
Here's 50 bucks
for the work.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.796
Plus don't pay me
for any rent this month.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.381
- What?
- Rent is due soon.

12:36.506 --> 12:38.258
Don't pay it this month.

12:39.426 --> 12:41.762
And the next time you're thinking
about selling your blood,

12:41.887 --> 12:43.638
come talk to me about it.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.557
I don't like it.

12:45.682 --> 12:48.852
I don't like people
selling their blood to eat.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.230
It's true
the hospital medical people

12:52.355 --> 12:54.232
need people to donate blood,

12:54.357 --> 12:56.818
but you've given
enough already.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.153
Yes, sir.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.405
Keep your blood, Kriscol.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.699
Yes, sir.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.474
Hello, Sarah.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.601
Hawk.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.102
Been meaning to stop by.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.897
Some old cases popped up,
and I thought about you.

14:58.148 --> 15:01.484
That's very kind of you,

15:01.610 --> 15:03.278
but I suppose
you're really here

15:03.403 --> 15:06.489
because of what happened
in the grocery store.

15:06.615 --> 15:08.158
Yeah, I heard about that.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.744
Uh, people were worried
about you.

15:12.704 --> 15:15.290
I just don't know
what came over me.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.628
But, uh, you're okay now.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.255
I feel fine now.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.552
- Is somebody in the house?
- No.

15:29.346 --> 15:31.431
No, just something
in the kitchen.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.770
You're okay, then.

15:39.564 --> 15:42.859
It's a goddamn bad story,

15:42.984 --> 15:44.444
isn't it, Hawk?

15:48.657 --> 15:50.325
Sarah, if you need any help,

15:50.450 --> 15:52.535
if you need anything,

15:52.661 --> 15:54.037
I want you to call, okay?

15:54.162 --> 15:55.372
I mean it.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.127
Help of any kind.

16:05.840 --> 16:06.967
Thanks, Hawk.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.753
- Excuse me.
- Hmm?

17:24.878 --> 17:26.004
Sheriff Truman is here.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.338
Yeah, please,
have him come in.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.054
Oh.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.306
Frank.

17:36.431 --> 17:37.599
Good to see you.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.725
How are you?

17:39.434 --> 17:40.602
Have a seat.

17:40.727 --> 17:41.770
Yeah.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.481
So...

17:54.407 --> 17:56.076
What can I do for you?

17:57.202 --> 17:59.871
There's no easy way
to say this, Ben.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.460
Your grandson, Richard,

18:05.585 --> 18:08.588
was the one who ran over
and killed that little boy.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.887
Oh, my God.

18:17.972 --> 18:19.182
Richard.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.811
And it looks like he tried

18:22.936 --> 18:25.939
to kill the only witness
who saw him do it.

18:27.690 --> 18:29.275
Miriam Sullivan.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.152
Nursery school teacher.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.404
She's in intensive care.

18:33.530 --> 18:34.948
No insurance.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.783
Desperately needs an operation.

18:36.908 --> 18:39.327
I was hoping that you could‒

18:39.452 --> 18:41.121
Of course.
Of course.

18:43.414 --> 18:44.666
I'll take care of it.

18:47.585 --> 18:48.795
Richard.

18:50.171 --> 18:53.133
That boy has never
been right.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.428
Sorry to have
to bring you this news.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.062
Harry, your brother,

19:06.187 --> 19:09.440
has had a number of run-ins
with Richard.

19:10.608 --> 19:12.277
Nothing too bad,
but each time

19:12.402 --> 19:14.654
was worse
than the time before, and...

19:17.073 --> 19:18.116
Does Harry know about this?

19:18.241 --> 19:19.659
Yeah.

19:19.784 --> 19:20.994
We stay in touch.

19:22.036 --> 19:24.581
And Richard is‒
Where is he? Is he in jail?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.083
He's on the run.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.668
If you hear from him‒

19:28.793 --> 19:30.420
Oh.

19:30.545 --> 19:31.754
I doubt that.

19:32.714 --> 19:35.884
We pretty much lost contact

19:36.009 --> 19:38.344
when I refused
to give him more money.

19:39.971 --> 19:41.222
How's Harry?

19:42.724 --> 19:44.267
He's hanging in there.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.436
Course, we're hoping
for the best.

19:46.561 --> 19:47.520
Of course.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.273
And that girl?

19:50.398 --> 19:51.774
Is she in the hospital here?

19:51.900 --> 19:53.359
Yeah.

19:53.484 --> 19:54.944
Intensive care?

19:55.069 --> 19:56.154
Yeah.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.659
And the boy's parents?

20:02.911 --> 20:04.871
As you can imagine.

20:21.179 --> 20:23.348
I was going to send this
to Harry.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.183
What's that?

20:25.975 --> 20:27.393
The key here.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.314
Showed up in the mail
the other day.

20:32.190 --> 20:34.734
We haven't used
a key like this

20:34.859 --> 20:36.861
in over 20 years.

20:39.530 --> 20:41.866
Room 315.

20:43.493 --> 20:47.080
I'm pretty sure
that this is the key

20:47.205 --> 20:49.457
to Agent Cooper's old room.

20:51.793 --> 20:55.255
I thought Harry would like
to have it as a memento.

20:56.965 --> 20:58.174
You think he would?

20:59.175 --> 21:00.260
Yeah.

21:01.803 --> 21:03.012
Yeah, Ben.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.890
You want me to take it for him?

21:08.226 --> 21:09.060
Yeah.

21:10.353 --> 21:11.437
Yeah.

21:11.562 --> 21:12.814
You think he would like it?

21:13.564 --> 21:14.399
Yeah.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.194
Interesting.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.447
We're just opening up
an old case

21:21.572 --> 21:23.616
involving Agent Cooper.

21:25.118 --> 21:26.703
Strange...

21:26.828 --> 21:30.331
this key shows up
after all these years.

21:32.458 --> 21:33.626
Yeah.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.130
I thought so too.

21:41.092 --> 21:43.928
I really think
he would like it.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.638
It'd mean a lot to him.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.348
Hmm.

21:50.685 --> 21:53.938
I'm sorry, Ben,
to bring you this news.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.024
Good to see you again.

21:56.149 --> 21:58.568
Wish it was under
better circumstances.

21:58.693 --> 22:00.486
Yeah.

22:01.404 --> 22:03.781
I'll let you know if, uh...

22:03.906 --> 22:04.991
if I hear from him.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.494
I'll let you know
if we have more news.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.166
Thanks, Frank.

22:18.254 --> 22:19.255
For Harry.

22:49.744 --> 22:50.703
Richard...

22:52.205 --> 22:53.748
...my grandson...

22:56.459 --> 22:58.586
...killed that little boy.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.967
I am so sorry.

23:14.936 --> 23:17.021
Richard never had a father.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.576
I remember...

23:32.078 --> 23:33.913
...I remember riding.

23:38.543 --> 23:42.255
My father got me
this old Schwinn...

23:43.881 --> 23:45.591
...secondhand.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.178
He painted it green...

23:51.055 --> 23:52.640
...got a new seat for it.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.437
Two-tone green, kind of a...

23:57.562 --> 24:01.607
kind of a lime green
and a deep forest green.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.862
Fat tires.

24:07.155 --> 24:10.741
Oh, it was so hard to ride,

24:10.867 --> 24:13.411
but I loved that bike.

24:16.456 --> 24:19.584
I loved that bike.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.630
I'd ride with my friends.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.226
Call the hospital.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.521
I want you to arrange to pay

24:40.646 --> 24:42.482
for all of Miriam, uh...

24:43.733 --> 24:45.318
I don't even remember
her last name,

24:45.443 --> 24:47.111
but they'll‒they'll know
who she is.

24:47.236 --> 24:50.198
All of Miriam's
medical expenses.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.160
Richard assaulted her.

24:55.870 --> 24:57.455
She needs an operation.

24:59.165 --> 25:01.000
Beverly, please take care
of this right away.

25:01.125 --> 25:02.084
Yeah, of course.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.503
I'll do it right now.

25:13.012 --> 25:15.640
I loved that bike.

25:18.809 --> 25:22.480
I loved that bike

25:22.605 --> 25:24.941
that my father got for me.

25:30.571 --> 25:32.907
The trap was set.

25:33.032 --> 25:35.535
They waited
till after midnight,

25:35.660 --> 25:39.789
and then, 75 strong,
they came up over the mountain,

25:39.914 --> 25:42.583
sirens wailing, guns drawn‒

26:01.936 --> 26:02.979
Albert.

26:13.864 --> 26:15.241
Gordon,

26:15.366 --> 26:17.743
would you please ask your friend
to wait downstairs?

26:22.415 --> 26:25.793
Sweetheart, would you excuse us
for a moment?

26:25.918 --> 26:27.461
I'll call you in the bar.

26:29.880 --> 26:31.299
<i>Oui, mon chéri.</i>

27:08.586 --> 27:09.837
<i>Très chic.</i>

28:01.180 --> 28:02.431
<i>Très bon.</i>

28:03.891 --> 28:05.184
It's a good one.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.032
Call you at the bar.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.294
She's here visiting
a friend of her mother

29:13.419 --> 29:15.463
whose daughter
has gone missing.

29:16.881 --> 29:19.383
The mother owns
a turnip farm.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.469
I told her
to tell the mother

29:21.594 --> 29:25.222
that her daughter
will turn up eventually.

29:33.689 --> 29:35.483
She didn't get it either.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.235
Being French,
it doesn't translate.

29:38.360 --> 29:40.362
Do you realize, Albert,

29:40.488 --> 29:43.240
that there are
more than 6,000 languages

29:43.365 --> 29:45.785
spoken on Earth today?

29:57.838 --> 29:59.006
What is it, Albert?

30:04.470 --> 30:06.931
Incoming to Diane:

30:07.056 --> 30:08.557
"Las Vegas?"

30:08.682 --> 30:10.935
Outgoing:

30:11.060 --> 30:12.770
"They haven't asked yet."

30:19.902 --> 30:22.196
What do we know

30:22.321 --> 30:24.323
that we haven't
asked her about?

30:32.122 --> 30:33.999
We'll figure it out.

30:34.124 --> 30:37.127
But for now, I'd really like
to get back

30:37.253 --> 30:39.338
to this fine Bordeaux.

30:40.673 --> 30:42.007
What kind is it?

30:46.053 --> 30:47.847
11:05.

31:12.830 --> 31:13.873
Albert...

31:18.127 --> 31:20.671
...sometimes I really worry
about you.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.214
You sure?

32:04.340 --> 32:05.424
I'm sure.

32:07.176 --> 32:09.428
We don't have time
for torture, babe.

32:09.553 --> 32:11.347
I'm hungry.

32:11.472 --> 32:13.223
Passed a Wendy's back there.

32:13.349 --> 32:14.475
Just shoot him.

32:15.893 --> 32:17.269
Okay, I'm there.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.398
I can shoot him in the legs.

32:21.523 --> 32:22.650
We kidnap him.

32:22.775 --> 32:23.943
Then you could torture him.

32:26.403 --> 32:28.197
Told you, I'm hungry.

32:28.322 --> 32:29.615
Just making sure.

32:42.086 --> 32:43.087
He's here.

33:24.420 --> 33:25.796
Daddy!

33:25.921 --> 33:26.880
Daddy.

33:28.215 --> 33:29.925
Next stop, Wendy's.

33:30.050 --> 33:32.177
Daddy! Daddy!

33:33.679 --> 33:35.055
Daddy!

33:35.180 --> 33:36.432
Daddy!

33:55.784 --> 33:58.162
It's seven o'clock.

33:58.287 --> 34:00.289
Do you know
where your freedom is?

34:09.923 --> 34:11.633
Coming to you live

34:11.759 --> 34:14.136
and electrified
from studio A,

34:14.261 --> 34:17.306
high atop the escarpments
of White Tail Peak,

34:17.431 --> 34:19.058
the roof‒
ruff, ruff‒

34:19.183 --> 34:21.643
of the American Hindu Kush,

34:21.769 --> 34:23.353
this is Dr. Amp

34:23.479 --> 34:25.522
doing the vamp
for liberty,

34:25.647 --> 34:28.358
climbing the ramp
to justice,

34:28.484 --> 34:30.527
and lighting the lamp
of freedom.

34:37.117 --> 34:39.244
So...

34:39.369 --> 34:41.080
what's on your mind tonight?

34:41.955 --> 34:44.124
I mean, you know I'm gonna
tell you what's on mine.

34:44.249 --> 34:46.919
We're sinking down deep
in the mud.

34:47.586 --> 34:49.129
<i>Act now!</i>

34:52.216 --> 34:56.720
<i>Friends, we all live in the mud.</i>

34:56.845 --> 34:58.972
<i>In the shit!</i>

34:59.098 --> 35:02.392
Shovel your way
out of the shit.

35:17.074 --> 35:20.035
This is your shiny
gold shovel.

35:20.160 --> 35:23.122
Two coats, guaranteed.

35:23.247 --> 35:26.208
Shovel your way out of the shit

35:26.333 --> 35:27.918
<i>and into the truth.</i>

35:29.628 --> 35:32.047
It's working for me, Dr. Amp.

35:32.172 --> 35:36.760
Dig yourself
out of the shit‒$29.99.

35:36.885 --> 35:37.928
That's right.

35:38.053 --> 35:41.974
Only $29.99 plus shipping.

35:42.099 --> 35:44.268
<i>Accept no substitute.</i>

35:44.393 --> 35:47.146
<i>Get yours now.</i>

35:47.271 --> 35:48.647
Oh.

35:48.772 --> 35:51.358
<i>And the fucks are at it again!</i>

35:51.483 --> 35:54.778
These giant
multinational corporations

35:54.903 --> 35:58.991
are filled
with monstrous vermin,

35:59.116 --> 36:01.493
poisonous, vile murderers,

36:01.618 --> 36:04.705
and they eat, drink,
and shit money.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.916
They buy our politicians
for a song.

36:08.041 --> 36:10.252
Then these fucking politicians

36:10.377 --> 36:14.047
sing as we gag and cough,

36:14.173 --> 36:17.301
sold down the river to die.

36:17.426 --> 36:20.596
Fuck you who betray the people
you were elected to help,

36:20.721 --> 36:22.264
elected to work to help

36:22.389 --> 36:24.183
to make life better for.

36:24.308 --> 36:29.104
Fuck you all in the ass,
you fucking treasonous puppets!

36:29.229 --> 36:32.566
The ninth level of hell
will welcome you.

37:15.943 --> 37:18.320
Okay, I'm tired of waiting
for the phone to ring.

37:18.445 --> 37:19.696
I'm going to the Roadhouse.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.449
I know he couldn't stand
that place,

37:22.574 --> 37:24.368
but we've checked
everywhere else.

37:24.493 --> 37:26.536
Are you coming with me?

37:26.662 --> 37:29.206
Audrey,
look at this paperwork I have,

37:29.331 --> 37:30.540
and I've got a deadline.

37:32.042 --> 37:33.919
Look, stacks of it.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.632
How can I leave this
and go out so late at night?

37:38.757 --> 37:41.510
I want to find Billy
same as you, but...

37:41.635 --> 37:44.137
can't we start out
in the light of day?

37:44.263 --> 37:46.723
It's a new moon tonight.
It'll be dark out there.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.350
Stay here and get a good sleep,

37:48.475 --> 37:50.602
and we'll both
go looking tomorrow.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.982
What kind of shit are you?

37:55.107 --> 37:56.858
If you were missing,
would you want people

37:56.984 --> 37:58.277
finishing their fucking homework

37:58.402 --> 37:59.987
before they went looking
for you?

38:02.072 --> 38:03.991
You're nothing
but a spineless,

38:04.116 --> 38:06.368
no-balls loser.

38:06.493 --> 38:07.411
Do you know that?

38:08.036 --> 38:09.162
Do you?

38:09.288 --> 38:12.499
Because that's what
you really are.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.501
Audrey,

38:14.626 --> 38:16.128
I have a deadline.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.881
I have to do this.

38:20.007 --> 38:23.760
Why do you put me down
for doing my allotted duty in life?

38:23.885 --> 38:26.138
Billy is out there somewhere,

38:26.263 --> 38:28.223
but you're not gonna
find him tonight.

38:28.348 --> 38:29.433
I guarantee it.

38:29.558 --> 38:32.936
Oh, you know for certain.

38:33.061 --> 38:36.106
What fucking crystal ball
are you looking into?

38:37.357 --> 38:39.901
Why don't you ask
your crystal ball

38:40.027 --> 38:41.403
where the fuck Billy is,

38:41.528 --> 38:44.239
who's been missing
for two days?

38:44.364 --> 38:45.615
Huh?

38:45.741 --> 38:46.783
Ask your ball.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.452
Come on, Audrey.

38:48.577 --> 38:50.370
You know I don't have
a crystal ball.

38:51.747 --> 38:54.666
It's already late,
and I'm getting sleepy.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.961
I have so much more work to do
before I get to sleep.

38:58.086 --> 39:01.214
You poor fucking thing.

39:01.340 --> 39:04.551
I told you, don't talk that way
to your husband.

39:04.676 --> 39:05.844
I've been good to you.

39:05.969 --> 39:07.471
You always say it,

39:07.596 --> 39:08.889
how I've been good to you.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.849
Who cares?

39:15.228 --> 39:16.813
What?

39:16.938 --> 39:19.608
I got to thank you
every hour on the hour,

39:19.733 --> 39:22.652
get on my knees
and adore you?

39:22.778 --> 39:26.073
Audrey, I don't like
the tone of your voice.

39:26.198 --> 39:27.574
Look, Charlie,

39:27.699 --> 39:30.035
let's just
call a spade a spade.

39:30.160 --> 39:32.412
You have no balls.

39:32.537 --> 39:34.373
That's why I'm in love
with Billy.

39:35.415 --> 39:37.959
That's why I am fucking Billy.

39:38.085 --> 39:39.294
Audrey.

39:39.419 --> 39:41.880
I saw Billy
in my dream last night,

39:42.005 --> 39:45.050
and he was bleeding
from the nose and mouth.

39:45.175 --> 39:48.053
And dreams sometimes
hearken a truth.

39:48.178 --> 39:49.846
Now, I got to go, Charlie.

39:49.971 --> 39:51.431
I asked for your company,

39:51.556 --> 39:52.974
your protection,

39:53.100 --> 39:54.518
but you're such a milquetoast,

39:54.643 --> 39:57.396
the only protection would be
me protecting you.

39:58.772 --> 39:59.606
And Tina‒

39:59.731 --> 40:02.192
I got to find Tina.

40:02.317 --> 40:04.277
She was the last person
to see Billy,

40:04.403 --> 40:08.073
and I can't fucking stand
being in the same room with her.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.575
You were supposed to call her,

40:10.700 --> 40:12.160
but you never did.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.332
Don't be sore at me, Audrey.

40:18.542 --> 40:20.127
You know I just want
the best for you.

40:20.252 --> 40:21.420
Yeah?

40:22.087 --> 40:24.548
Well, then sign
the papers I gave you.

40:25.132 --> 40:26.550
Uh, I don't know, Audrey.

40:26.675 --> 40:28.468
Those papers...

40:28.593 --> 40:31.138
there's something fishy
about them.

40:31.263 --> 40:34.433
I'm not signing anything
until I run them by my lawyer.

40:34.558 --> 40:35.892
Oh, I see.

40:36.977 --> 40:38.937
Maybe I should run them
by Paul.

40:40.355 --> 40:42.816
Maybe I should have Paul
come give you a visit.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.234
Don't, Audrey.

40:44.359 --> 40:45.861
Don't be like this.

40:46.653 --> 40:48.280
I'm your lawfully wedded
husband.

40:48.405 --> 40:49.573
I have rights.

40:50.198 --> 40:52.075
You gave up those rights.

40:53.743 --> 40:54.619
What?

40:58.915 --> 41:02.377
You mean you'd go back
on our contract?

41:04.880 --> 41:08.091
Renege on a contract?

41:08.216 --> 41:09.843
That's what I will do.

41:10.510 --> 41:12.471
That's what I'm doing.

41:18.101 --> 41:19.394
Okay, Audrey.

41:23.273 --> 41:24.274
I'll go with you.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.154
I'm so sleepy, but I'll go.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.823
Where are we going?

41:33.325 --> 41:34.701
We're going to the Roadhouse.

41:34.826 --> 41:36.077
I told you.

41:36.953 --> 41:38.997
Oh, Audrey.

41:41.249 --> 41:42.375
I'll go, then.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.086
I'll need my jacket.

41:47.756 --> 41:49.925
I see you've already
got yours.

41:50.050 --> 41:51.843
Uh, yeah, what the fuck
do you think?

41:51.968 --> 41:53.595
I told you we were going out.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.680
Obviously I'll need my jacket.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.808
There's thousands
of square miles of woods

41:58.934 --> 42:00.310
out there, Audrey.

42:00.435 --> 42:02.771
Do you think we're just
gonna walk out the door

42:02.896 --> 42:05.774
or waltz into the Roadhouse
and presto,

42:05.899 --> 42:06.775
there he'll be?

42:06.900 --> 42:10.111
Just get your jacket.

42:11.321 --> 42:12.572
Asshole.

42:14.074 --> 42:15.116
Wait a minute.

42:19.204 --> 42:20.038
Tina.

42:22.499 --> 42:24.042
Let me call her now, okay?

42:25.252 --> 42:28.046
I know, I'll tell her
I'm alone, but...

42:29.047 --> 42:30.715
...let's see if she knows anything.

42:30.840 --> 42:34.469
If her husband's there,
she won't be able to talk, but...

42:34.594 --> 42:35.595
let's see.

42:35.720 --> 42:37.055
Okay?

42:38.640 --> 42:40.767
Okay, call the bitch.
See what she knows.

42:41.476 --> 42:44.062
Supposedly she was
the last one to see Billy.

42:44.771 --> 42:46.147
But I think Chuck
is certifiable,

42:46.273 --> 42:48.942
so we can't count on shit
from him.

42:51.653 --> 42:55.073
Chuck told you Tina
was the last person to see Billy?

42:58.827 --> 42:59.744
Yeah.

43:04.749 --> 43:08.378
Did you know that Chuck
stole Billy's truck last week?

43:09.087 --> 43:11.089
What are you talking about?

43:11.214 --> 43:12.674
Billy came out of his house

43:12.799 --> 43:15.969
and saw Chuck driving off
with his truck.

43:17.262 --> 43:18.221
And?

43:18.346 --> 43:20.515
And Billy called the sheriff.

43:22.017 --> 43:23.435
And?

43:23.560 --> 43:26.563
And they found the truck
that same afternoon.

43:29.608 --> 43:30.692
So what happened, then?

43:30.817 --> 43:31.776
They called Billy,

43:31.901 --> 43:34.362
and I guess
Billy got his truck back

43:34.487 --> 43:37.282
and dropped any charges.

43:38.074 --> 43:39.034
Really?

43:42.787 --> 43:43.997
Okay.

43:45.832 --> 43:47.167
Call Tina.

44:11.900 --> 44:13.193
I'm so tired, Audrey.

44:16.237 --> 44:17.280
Hello?

44:17.405 --> 44:19.324
Yes, Tina.
It's Charlie.

44:19.449 --> 44:20.408
How are you?

44:25.538 --> 44:26.539
Yeah?

44:27.374 --> 44:28.667
Yeah, I know.

44:29.834 --> 44:32.045
Sorry to call so late.

44:32.170 --> 44:34.631
I wanted to ask you something.

44:34.756 --> 44:36.174
Okay?

44:41.012 --> 44:43.264
Yeah, so Chuck told me

44:43.390 --> 44:46.017
you might have been
the last person to see Billy.

44:48.311 --> 44:49.187
Is this true?

44:51.648 --> 44:52.524
What?

44:56.194 --> 44:58.363
Yeah, I know that.

45:00.949 --> 45:02.033
You're sure?

45:07.080 --> 45:08.039
But...

45:09.708 --> 45:10.750
Okay.

45:13.253 --> 45:14.087
Yeah.

45:17.674 --> 45:18.883
Yes, Tina.

45:21.720 --> 45:22.887
Okay.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.515
How did you find‒
What?

45:27.851 --> 45:28.727
Really?

45:34.023 --> 45:35.275
Oh, my goodness.

45:37.444 --> 45:38.611
Thank you, Tina.

45:41.573 --> 45:42.407
Great.

45:48.329 --> 45:49.789
I'll talk to you soon.

45:50.999 --> 45:52.542
I'll try tomorrow.

45:57.213 --> 46:00.633
Yeah, again,
sorry to call so late.

46:01.926 --> 46:04.387
Unbelievable,
what you're telling me.

46:08.349 --> 46:09.517
I won't.

46:09.642 --> 46:11.102
Come...

46:12.395 --> 46:14.105
I promise.

46:18.067 --> 46:19.527
Yeah, me too.

46:24.949 --> 46:25.867
Bye.

46:50.099 --> 46:52.227
You're not gonna tell me
what she said?

47:00.235 --> 47:02.529
You're not gonna
tell me what she said?

47:06.157 --> 47:07.492
Charlie!

47:37.272 --> 47:38.773
I know you're closed.

47:39.524 --> 47:40.733
Thanks.

48:10.972 --> 48:15.518
Coordinates.

48:26.946 --> 48:30.992
"Co...or...

48:31.117 --> 48:35.121
din...ates...

48:35.246 --> 48:37.332
plus two."

50:25.982 --> 50:27.400
Where's Angela?

50:28.901 --> 50:30.445
I haven't got a clue.

50:30.570 --> 50:33.531
She was supposed to show
last night.

50:33.656 --> 50:35.366
She didn't show then either.

50:36.659 --> 50:37.702
She might be with Clark.

50:39.704 --> 50:41.414
- Clark?
- Yeah.

50:41.539 --> 50:43.750
They've been hanging out lately.

50:48.713 --> 50:49.589
Really?

50:49.714 --> 50:50.631
Yeah.

50:51.424 --> 50:52.967
You look surprised.

50:53.092 --> 50:56.220
Yeah, 'cause I saw Clark
and Mary together here,

50:56.345 --> 50:58.347
like, two nights ago.

51:00.683 --> 51:01.559
I hate her.

51:03.227 --> 51:04.437
Well...

51:04.562 --> 51:07.398
And Angela fucking
really hates her too.

51:10.401 --> 51:11.778
What were they doing?

51:11.903 --> 51:14.072
Like, practically making out.

51:14.197 --> 51:17.241
Slow dancing
and getting real close.

51:18.159 --> 51:19.410
Over in the corner.

51:19.535 --> 51:21.287
Off in their own world.

51:22.080 --> 51:24.165
Lots of people saw 'em.

51:24.290 --> 51:28.377
Angela's gonna go crazy
when she gets wind of this.

51:28.503 --> 51:31.672
She's getting really serious
about Clark.

51:31.798 --> 51:35.093
He's been on her
for a couple of weeks now.

51:35.218 --> 51:36.969
She's even dreaming
about the guy.

51:37.095 --> 51:38.346
Shit.

51:38.471 --> 51:41.099
I guess Clark's
spreading it around.

51:45.061 --> 51:47.146
And she's off her meds now.

51:49.941 --> 51:52.235
I hope Clark
doesn't fuck this up.

51:53.945 --> 51:56.030
She won't be able to take it,
I don't think.

51:56.155 --> 51:58.908
Well, yeah.

51:59.033 --> 52:00.868
She's kind of on the edge.

52:00.993 --> 52:02.203
Who wouldn't be?

52:03.246 --> 52:04.789
Losing her mom like that?

52:05.873 --> 52:06.999
Fuck.

52:07.125 --> 52:08.543
- Yeah.
- Hey!

52:08.668 --> 52:10.962
I almost got fucking killed
coming over here.

52:11.087 --> 52:13.172
Some fucking ass-eater's heading
toward me on the highway

52:13.297 --> 52:14.674
and runs me off the road.

52:14.799 --> 52:17.301
All I see is two headlights
coming fucking right at me.

52:17.426 --> 52:19.512
I drove off the road
and almost hit a tree.

52:19.637 --> 52:21.305
Some farmer had to pull me out.

52:21.973 --> 52:23.850
Man, I could kill
the motherfucker that did that.

52:26.269 --> 52:28.479
I need a beer.
Obviously you want one too.

52:28.604 --> 52:30.106
- Do you want another one?
- Yeah, sure.

52:30.231 --> 52:31.607
All right, I'll be right back.

52:31.732 --> 52:33.192
Thanks, Trick.

52:33.317 --> 52:36.070
Trick's lucky to be alive,
sounds like.

52:36.195 --> 52:37.572
Sure does.

52:38.531 --> 52:40.408
By the way, isn't Trick
under house arrest?

52:40.533 --> 52:41.534
No. I-I mean, yeah,

52:41.659 --> 52:43.786
but he got that behind him now.

52:46.497 --> 52:48.040
He's a free man again.

52:49.917 --> 52:51.335
A free man.

52:52.420 --> 52:53.921
Whoopee.
