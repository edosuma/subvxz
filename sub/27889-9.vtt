WEBVTT

00:14.947 --> 00:17.250
( fire crackling )

00:18.050 --> 00:20.153
( Katie sobbing )

00:29.228 --> 00:30.497
( glass shatters )

00:42.308 --> 00:43.276
( grunts )

00:47.480 --> 00:48.481
( glass breaks )

00:50.016 --> 00:51.084
Shun:<i> Stop!</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:55.421
Lana: Put it down, Katie.

00:55.454 --> 00:58.558
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

00:58.591 --> 01:02.328
Shun: We know what you did.
We know what you are.

01:02.829 --> 01:03.696
No.

01:05.164 --> 01:07.967
-No, no...
-Don't move.

01:08.000 --> 01:12.105
No, no, it's not that.
No, I swear, it's not that.
I swear.

01:16.809 --> 01:17.744
No!

01:17.777 --> 01:18.778
( Shun grunts )

01:20.746 --> 01:22.047
Shun: Get her!

01:22.081 --> 01:23.283
Lana: Katie!

01:25.818 --> 01:27.220
( panting )

01:31.724 --> 01:33.560
( both grunting )

01:34.527 --> 01:35.495
Katie: Get off me!

01:44.670 --> 01:45.638
( Katie struggling )

01:47.573 --> 01:48.441
I'm sorry.

02:40.993 --> 02:42.795
( indistinct chattering )

02:51.370 --> 02:56.376
Andrew: For there
is no greater gift
than mercy.

02:56.409 --> 03:00.780
For it is from mercy
that forgiveness can be born.

03:00.813 --> 03:04.217
<i> And it is from forgiveness
that we can find peace</i>

03:04.250 --> 03:06.452
with the wrongs done to us.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.236
For which of us
have never been wronged?

03:26.305 --> 03:29.976
And which of us
have never wronged another?

03:32.845 --> 03:34.247
Go now and think on this.

04:06.045 --> 04:06.913
Hi, Andy.

04:09.916 --> 04:10.817
Hello, Rachel.

04:19.958 --> 04:22.395
( groaning and gasping )

04:32.204 --> 04:33.673
( thudding )

04:33.706 --> 04:36.709
Hello! Let me out!

04:37.477 --> 04:38.478
No!

04:48.520 --> 04:51.757
-Is anybody there?
-Abigail:<i> It can't be her.</i>

04:51.790 --> 04:53.926
She's the last person
that I ever...

04:55.227 --> 04:56.729
Just, it doesn't
make any sense.

04:56.762 --> 04:59.299
Oh. Whereas me
being infected did?

05:07.673 --> 05:10.275
We found the scalpel
in Katie's room.

05:10.309 --> 05:12.178
<i> Why else would she
have smashed the chip?</i>

05:12.211 --> 05:13.780
( breathing heavily )

05:15.314 --> 05:17.182
Rey:<i> So, what are we
gonna do with her now?</i>

05:17.215 --> 05:20.853
Lana:<i> We're a day from Thea.
We just have to keep her
locked up till arrival.</i>

05:20.886 --> 05:22.322
SIREN can deal with her.

05:22.788 --> 05:24.624
( Baum stammers )

05:24.657 --> 05:28.494
Are you serious?
We're talking about
a murderer here.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.263
Oh, wait, I'm sorry.

05:31.296 --> 05:33.432
We're talking about
a fucking alien, and your
priority is to keep her cozy?

05:33.466 --> 05:36.935
-We can't hurt her, Baum.
-You think Lee would agree?

05:36.969 --> 05:38.371
Like you cared about Lee.

05:38.404 --> 05:39.605
Logan: I wanna see her.

05:43.342 --> 05:44.610
I need to.

05:45.578 --> 05:47.480
-( groans softly )
-( door opens )

05:51.183 --> 05:52.418
( gasps )

05:53.853 --> 05:55.988
Logan, finally...

06:13.305 --> 06:14.841
( door beeps, opens )

06:16.375 --> 06:17.810
( door closes )

06:17.843 --> 06:18.778
Did you kill Lee?

06:22.748 --> 06:25.418
-How can you ask me that?
-What the hell am I
supposed to think?

06:26.585 --> 06:28.855
You're supposed to trust me.

06:28.888 --> 06:30.756
I did trust you.

06:30.789 --> 06:33.358
And then you smashed
the fucking chip.

06:33.392 --> 06:36.495
Our one way of finding out
who was infected,

06:36.528 --> 06:38.898
and you haven't even given me
a goddamn explanation.

06:43.669 --> 06:46.038
Tell me! Why did you do it?

06:46.939 --> 06:48.974
Hey, look at me.

06:49.007 --> 06:50.576
( sobbing )

06:51.243 --> 06:52.111
Please.

06:54.279 --> 06:55.782
Why the fuck did you do it?

06:57.849 --> 06:58.785
I can't.

07:03.856 --> 07:04.724
Fine.

07:06.458 --> 07:07.794
You're SIREN's problem now.

07:10.095 --> 07:11.097
Logan!

07:16.034 --> 07:17.136
Logan...

07:28.014 --> 07:29.782
( birds squawking )

07:33.886 --> 07:34.887
Katie: Andrew!

07:40.692 --> 07:42.595
I'm sorry I just turned up.

07:44.196 --> 07:47.299
But I thought if I told you
I was coming,
I might talk myself out of it.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.734
( scoffs )

08:08.287 --> 08:09.489
Andrew:<i> Rachel...</i>

08:20.766 --> 08:23.669
No screens or anything?
( chuckles )

08:23.703 --> 08:24.837
No.

08:24.870 --> 08:27.506
-No outside contact.
-What is this place, Andy?

08:27.539 --> 08:28.908
All of you out here
in the middle of nowhere.

08:28.941 --> 08:30.009
It's my home now.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.946
-Rachel, how did you find me?
-Does it matter?

08:35.548 --> 08:37.916
-And it's "Katie" now.
-What?

08:37.950 --> 08:40.553
I don't go by
"Rachel" anymore.

08:41.721 --> 08:42.588
Right.

08:44.823 --> 08:45.691
Katie.

08:48.594 --> 08:49.862
Look, I know it's a lot,

08:52.164 --> 08:53.900
but I can help out. I can...

08:55.067 --> 08:56.068
Whatever you need.

08:58.937 --> 09:01.307
If you're happy for me to stay.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.046
You're my sister.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.018
( door opens )

09:14.020 --> 09:15.021
( door closes )

09:20.026 --> 09:21.794
Katie: Blank slate.

09:26.231 --> 09:27.300
There's no such thing.

09:29.234 --> 09:30.102
Is there?

09:33.572 --> 09:34.774
( Shun sighs )

09:36.609 --> 09:38.611
( low rumbling )

09:56.228 --> 09:57.229
Lana: Something's happening.

10:02.167 --> 10:03.703
( rumbling continues )

10:05.437 --> 10:06.305
Henri: The ship...

10:07.573 --> 10:08.941
It's changing.

10:15.013 --> 10:16.048
( beeping )

10:23.088 --> 10:25.257
Abigail: Rey?
Rey, what's going on?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.725
-The shields...
-Abigail: What?

10:26.758 --> 10:28.194
The shields are closing.

10:30.529 --> 10:31.731
Henri: What does that mean?

10:33.866 --> 10:35.301
-Rey?
-Just wait.

10:47.880 --> 10:49.749
( chuckles softly )

10:59.191 --> 11:02.194
That's it, isn't it?

11:04.196 --> 11:05.064
Thea.

11:15.640 --> 11:16.876
We made it.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.391
( door opens )

12:06.425 --> 12:07.793
What the hell do you want?

12:09.495 --> 12:11.663
-You haven't seen
it yet, have you?
-Just get out.

12:11.697 --> 12:13.299
Okay? I mean it.

12:13.332 --> 12:14.333
You couldn't have known.

12:15.467 --> 12:16.502
<i> She fooled all of us.</i>

12:19.204 --> 12:20.172
Yeah.

12:20.205 --> 12:23.943
Now, look out
the fucking window.

12:27.179 --> 12:28.180
Fucking...

12:29.681 --> 12:31.483
Oh, my God!

12:31.516 --> 12:33.385
-Is that...
-Baum:<i> That's it.</i>

12:33.418 --> 12:34.920
Logan:<i> Holy shit.</i>

12:35.754 --> 12:37.323
It's fucking beautiful.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.433
<i> Wait, do you see that?</i>

13:08.454 --> 13:09.321
Hey.

13:13.491 --> 13:14.794
I wanted you to know...

13:17.229 --> 13:18.364
We made it.

13:21.600 --> 13:22.835
And it's beautiful.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.945
I thought you might want
this back. ( sniffles )

13:37.549 --> 13:38.884
I've found my home.

13:39.818 --> 13:41.987
You should hold on
to yours. ( sniffles )

13:45.691 --> 13:46.959
Goodbye, Taylor.

14:02.875 --> 14:04.543
Abigail:<i> Rey!</i>

14:04.576 --> 14:07.179
-Rey!
-Hey. What's wrong?

14:07.212 --> 14:09.548
You have to come see this.
Come on.

14:11.483 --> 14:13.385
Lana: Did you guys
see it, too?
Henri: Yes.

14:13.418 --> 14:15.487
It looked like it was
coming towards us.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.264
Abigail:
<i> What the hell is that?</i>

14:40.412 --> 14:41.881
( door opening )

14:46.952 --> 14:48.287
( exhales )

15:06.838 --> 15:08.407
( whirring )

15:13.311 --> 15:14.313
It's empty.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.416
What the hell
is that thing?

15:19.818 --> 15:21.353
( energy pulsing )

15:21.387 --> 15:22.388
Henri: Get back.

15:25.590 --> 15:26.659
Get back.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.661
( crackling, whirring )

15:36.702 --> 15:38.670
Logan: What the fuck
is happening?

15:38.704 --> 15:39.705
Abigail: Oh, my God.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.616
Shun: It's going through
the whole damn ship.

15:54.519 --> 15:56.655
( alarm blaring )

16:01.393 --> 16:02.194
( whimpers )

16:02.227 --> 16:03.295
What the hell was that?

16:05.030 --> 16:06.632
( computer scanning )

16:08.600 --> 16:09.968
What's going on?

16:10.002 --> 16:11.636
Rey: It's taken control
of the ship!

16:11.670 --> 16:12.604
Those white flashes...

16:12.637 --> 16:15.840
It's scanning us.
It's scanning the<i> Origin.</i>

16:15.874 --> 16:17.376
Scanning, what for?

16:18.643 --> 16:19.778
"Non-native life form"?

16:19.811 --> 16:21.213
( beeping )

16:23.181 --> 16:24.783
( beeping stops )

16:24.816 --> 16:27.152
( rapid beeping )

16:27.186 --> 16:30.288
-What the hell is Protocol 47?
-I've never heard of it.

16:30.321 --> 16:32.491
Shun:
What's happening to Ring 9?

16:37.362 --> 16:38.430
We have to get
down there.

16:40.632 --> 16:42.267
What are those blue lights?

16:49.074 --> 16:50.576
Katie: ( shouts )
<i> What's happening?</i>

16:51.977 --> 16:53.545
What is going on?

16:54.846 --> 16:55.748
( grunting )

16:56.681 --> 17:00.219
Let me out!

17:05.023 --> 17:09.094
Somebody... ( sobs )
Is there anybody there?

17:15.968 --> 17:17.236
( door thuds )

17:25.677 --> 17:27.079
Katie:<i> Andrew!</i>

17:29.013 --> 17:31.450
You don't have
to sneak around.

17:31.483 --> 17:33.452
-Where are you going?
-I have a sermon.

17:34.686 --> 17:37.189
-Can I come?
-You?

17:37.222 --> 17:40.192
If it's important to you,
I wanna be a part of it.

17:42.861 --> 17:43.796
I don't think that...

17:46.498 --> 17:48.467
It takes a bit of time for us
to integrate people.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.970
Of course.

17:52.003 --> 17:56.241
Yeah, that's fine.
Just wanted something to do.

17:58.843 --> 17:59.845
Next time.

18:20.799 --> 18:21.800
Thank you.

18:30.008 --> 18:32.111
He never mentioned
any family.

18:32.711 --> 18:33.879
He didn't?

18:33.912 --> 18:36.648
It must be wonderful
having a brother
so close to the Lord.

18:38.950 --> 18:40.752
( chuckles )

18:40.785 --> 18:42.221
( indistinct chatter )

19:20.191 --> 19:21.693
( Katie shushing )

19:21.726 --> 19:22.728
It's okay.

19:24.128 --> 19:25.897
-( horse neighing )
-Whoa.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.266
Sean:<i> Whoa!</i>

19:27.299 --> 19:28.333
-( horse nickers )
-( Sean laughs )

19:28.367 --> 19:29.434
Come on. ( shushes )

19:30.068 --> 19:31.303
Stop posturing.

19:32.003 --> 19:33.238
There you go.

19:33.905 --> 19:35.974
He's just showing off.

19:36.007 --> 19:37.643
Soft as butter on the inside.

19:39.444 --> 19:40.646
You must be the sister.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.315
Am I the talk of the village?

19:43.348 --> 19:46.551
God-fearing man brings
a mysterious lady friend home.

19:46.584 --> 19:49.321
-How do you expect
people to react?
-"God-fearing..."

19:51.056 --> 19:52.958
Sorry, I mean...

19:52.991 --> 19:55.827
He's always been
just "Andrew" to me.

19:57.929 --> 19:59.197
I used to ride.

19:59.230 --> 20:00.966
It's been so long
I've probably forgotten how.

20:02.033 --> 20:03.235
Sean: You don't forget.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.437
Wanna give it a go?

20:06.939 --> 20:07.806
Andrew: Katie.

20:08.940 --> 20:09.841
Father...

20:11.276 --> 20:14.446
I'll see you later. Katie.

20:18.517 --> 20:20.918
Sorry, I saw
the horses and I...

20:20.952 --> 20:22.421
I don't want you
talking to him.

20:22.921 --> 20:24.623
What? Why?

20:25.456 --> 20:26.959
He's not like the rest of us.

20:29.461 --> 20:31.830
If you want to stay here,
you live by my rules.

20:33.164 --> 20:34.233
Okay?

20:35.834 --> 20:36.702
Okay.

20:53.385 --> 20:54.953
( shuttle whirring )

21:02.226 --> 21:03.929
automated voice:<i> Ring 9.</i>

21:08.600 --> 21:13.705
What the hell are these lines?
They run all through the ship.

21:17.242 --> 21:18.410
Shit!

21:19.277 --> 21:21.013
Lana:
What the fuck is that?

21:24.549 --> 21:27.852
Something's being
released into the ring.
It looks like gas.

21:27.885 --> 21:28.887
Abigail: Gas?

21:30.054 --> 21:32.156
Henri: What's that one? There.

21:32.190 --> 21:33.392
-Rey, come on!
-I don't know.

21:33.425 --> 21:35.060
I'm sorry. I don't
know what it is.

21:37.295 --> 21:38.830
Well, it's right outside.

21:45.537 --> 21:48.172
Whoa, Doc, what the fuck
are you gonna do?

21:48.206 --> 21:49.074
Abigail: Henri.

21:50.742 --> 21:51.877
( door opens )

21:53.044 --> 21:54.346
( grunts )

21:57.916 --> 21:59.785
Here. Stand back.

22:00.718 --> 22:03.254
-Rey: What's he doing?
-Come on! Fucking crazy!

22:03.287 --> 22:05.289
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

22:05.323 --> 22:06.958
(all shouting indistinctly )

22:10.161 --> 22:11.496
( grunting )

22:14.165 --> 22:15.033
-Help me.
-( ax clatters )

22:15.567 --> 22:17.469
Logan: This is insane!

22:20.038 --> 22:21.473
( Abigail grunts )

22:23.308 --> 22:25.977
Abigail: Henri,
what are those things?

22:26.011 --> 22:28.647
-Get back!
-Why? Why?
What the hell is it?

22:30.248 --> 22:34.385
Henri: I've seen it
on nerve agents
developed by the military.

22:34.419 --> 22:38.790
That sign...
What's inside is deadly.

22:38.823 --> 22:42.493
Logan:
<i> Did you say "nerve agents"?
Are they poisoning us?</i>

22:42.527 --> 22:44.796
Henri:<i> Whatever's being
released onto the ship,</i>

22:45.930 --> 22:47.999
it's designed to kill
everything on board.

22:50.101 --> 22:51.336
( alarm beeping )

22:51.369 --> 22:52.670
Shit!

22:52.704 --> 22:54.706
Baum: It's into Ring 8 now!

22:55.240 --> 22:56.641
( beeping continues )

22:58.276 --> 23:02.514
-It's moving fast.
-Why is this ship
trying to kill us?

23:05.650 --> 23:06.852
Non-native life form.

23:08.185 --> 23:10.021
<i> It's scanning for the alien.</i>

23:11.422 --> 23:13.158
We're all thinking
the same thing, right?

23:15.293 --> 23:16.661
Come on,
it's because of the parasite.

23:16.695 --> 23:17.929
No, no, no, no, no.
That's impossible.

23:17.962 --> 23:19.564
SIREN couldn't have known
about the parasite.

23:19.597 --> 23:21.966
The probe came
looking for the infection.

23:21.999 --> 23:24.435
Unless the alien is gone,
we're all gonna die.

23:24.469 --> 23:27.905
-What exactly
are you suggesting?
-Baum:<i> We know who's infected.</i>

23:27.939 --> 23:31.576
<i> We kill the host,
the alien dies with it,
and we don't get gassed.</i>

23:31.610 --> 23:33.344
Why not sacrifice her
right now?

23:33.377 --> 23:34.979
What the fuck
do you mean by that?

23:35.013 --> 23:38.150
-You're talking about murder.
-To save all of us.
She's not human.

23:38.750 --> 23:39.818
Fuck!

23:39.851 --> 23:41.186
( grunting )

23:43.755 --> 23:44.623
Okay.

23:50.995 --> 23:52.631
( alarm blaring )

24:02.206 --> 24:04.308
( beeping )

24:04.342 --> 24:06.344
Baum:<i> The scans
aren't gonna stop.</i>

24:06.377 --> 24:08.779
<i>She's going to get us killed,
isn't she?</i>

24:08.813 --> 24:09.647
Huh?

24:09.681 --> 24:12.216
We can't just execute her.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.718
-What if we're wrong?
-Exactly.

24:13.751 --> 24:15.753
Baum:<i> There is no time.
We have to act now.</i>

24:15.787 --> 24:17.489
Or am I missing something here?

24:20.358 --> 24:21.226
Shun?

24:22.393 --> 24:23.795
( Shun sighs )

24:29.100 --> 24:30.035
If that's the only way out.

24:32.804 --> 24:34.840
I don't want the rest of us
to die on this ship.

24:43.081 --> 24:45.917
-We're so close now.
-No.

24:46.751 --> 24:49.487
No, there has to
be another way.

24:49.520 --> 24:50.922
Baum: It's us or the alien.

24:52.456 --> 24:53.625
I choose us.

24:59.364 --> 25:00.532
Where's Logan?

25:03.868 --> 25:06.838
-What are you doing here?
-Kate, get back.
I said, get back!

25:08.005 --> 25:09.107
Fuck it.

25:13.111 --> 25:14.612
Come here, come here.

25:14.645 --> 25:16.981
-All right, we gotta go.
-( groans ) What's going on?

25:17.015 --> 25:19.651
The ship knows about
the parasite. We've got
to get you out of here.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.820
-Why?
-'Cause they're gonna
fucking kill you.

25:22.120 --> 25:22.988
Come on.

25:23.755 --> 25:25.290
( birds squawking )

25:37.235 --> 25:38.870
-Sermon?
-Yeah.

25:40.671 --> 25:41.840
Hope it goes well.

25:43.307 --> 25:44.175
Thanks.

25:46.611 --> 25:48.713
( people singing indistinctly )

25:53.651 --> 25:54.986
( door closes )

26:02.961 --> 26:05.797
-Why don't you
come with me?
-What?

26:07.599 --> 26:08.667
Just come.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.875
( all singing )

26:52.344 --> 26:54.746
( inaudible )

27:31.749 --> 27:34.419
( all vocalizing )

27:37.155 --> 27:39.057
( loud humming )

27:45.362 --> 27:46.965
( drone humming )

27:48.933 --> 27:50.435
Father, what is that?

27:51.102 --> 27:52.170
It's for me.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.746
Come on. Come on. Let's go.

28:01.780 --> 28:04.115
-Andy... It's for me.
-Let's go.

28:05.383 --> 28:06.985
( humming continues )

28:34.712 --> 28:36.047
( scan beeping )

29:19.290 --> 29:20.959
No. No, no, no!

29:21.859 --> 29:23.528
Logan,
you fucking idiot.

29:24.528 --> 29:26.030
( panting )

29:29.466 --> 29:32.303
-We'll search the ring.
-Wait. What are you
gonna do to her?

29:34.538 --> 29:35.406
We don't have a choice.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.979
I can't. Not again.

29:44.682 --> 29:47.118
-Give him your gun, Lana.
-What?

29:47.151 --> 29:49.487
You can't do what needs
to be done, fine. But I will.

29:50.855 --> 29:52.056
Let's shoot the right person
this time, shall we?

29:58.262 --> 29:59.230
Give him your gun.

30:06.938 --> 30:08.973
Thank you. Let's go.

30:13.111 --> 30:14.045
I'm sorry.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.357
-Logan, why are you
doing this?
-( panting ) What?

30:26.390 --> 30:28.759
Less than an hour ago,
you were accusing me
of murdering Lee,

30:28.793 --> 30:29.860
and now you're trying
to save my life?

30:29.894 --> 30:31.395
I'm not just
gonna let them kill you.

30:31.428 --> 30:33.230
-Why not,
if you think I did it?
-I don't know what to think!

30:33.264 --> 30:36.201
I came to you
when they cast you out,
or did you forget?

30:37.502 --> 30:38.669
( door opens )

30:38.702 --> 30:40.304
-Run, run!
-Baum: Stop, stop, stop!

30:40.337 --> 30:41.372
( gunshot )

30:53.284 --> 30:54.219
Shit.

30:56.020 --> 30:58.322
-The shuttle.
-No.

30:58.355 --> 31:00.625
Gas is rising.
We'll stay on Ring 1.

31:17.641 --> 31:19.176
What if Katie isn't infected?

31:19.210 --> 31:23.247
<i> We could be hunting her
when the alien's
still among us.</i>

31:23.281 --> 31:26.651
We've been wrong before.
We can't just go around
killing each other.

31:28.653 --> 31:29.954
Unless...

31:31.122 --> 31:32.190
What?

31:33.423 --> 31:34.459
No, no.

31:36.327 --> 31:37.362
Rey: Say it.

31:39.897 --> 31:45.570
It is possible to temporarily
suspend someone's life
and bring them back.

31:47.805 --> 31:50.308
-Can you do that?
-In theory,

31:50.341 --> 31:52.277
but it would have
to be a last resort.

31:53.877 --> 31:55.412
<i> There are huge risks.</i>

31:55.446 --> 31:59.216
Abigail:
<i> Yeah, but if we did have
any doubts about Katie...</i>

31:59.250 --> 32:03.421
It could be the only way
to avoid an unjust execution.

32:06.824 --> 32:08.525
( groaning )

32:08.559 --> 32:10.862
I can't. Go on without me.

32:10.895 --> 32:12.397
Kate, just run!

32:12.830 --> 32:14.365
-No.
-Kate...

32:14.398 --> 32:16.534
What's the point,
unless you believe me?

32:19.604 --> 32:20.672
( door opens )

32:21.339 --> 32:22.873
Out of the way!

32:22.907 --> 32:24.409
Logan:<i> Whoa! Stop!</i>

32:24.442 --> 32:25.910
-Get out of
the way, Logan.
-No!

32:25.943 --> 32:28.246
-Baum: She's fucking
with your head, Logan!
-No, she's not!

32:28.880 --> 32:30.481
No, she's not, okay?

32:31.015 --> 32:32.083
It's not her!

32:33.617 --> 32:35.019
<i> I know it's not her!</i>

32:36.821 --> 32:38.623
-( alarm blaring )
-( rumbling )

32:44.295 --> 32:47.331
-Please, please, please!
-Baum: We don't have
time for this.

32:47.365 --> 32:49.367
Just listen to me.
Listen to me.

32:51.702 --> 32:52.570
Whoa.
What are you doing?

32:53.303 --> 32:54.238
It's okay.

33:05.316 --> 33:08.653
I know you think I smashed
the chip because I'm infected,

33:10.488 --> 33:12.089
but it's because
I couldn't bear the thought

33:12.122 --> 33:13.624
of you all knowing
who I used to be.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.265
I came here for a blank slate,

33:22.900 --> 33:24.469
and I wasn't ready
to lose it.

33:30.140 --> 33:33.177
Something just came over me.

33:36.547 --> 33:37.615
Convenient.

33:37.648 --> 33:40.751
You can believe me or not,
but I swear, killing me

33:40.784 --> 33:42.687
won't kill the alien.

33:44.255 --> 33:45.723
I'm telling the truth.

33:48.325 --> 33:49.360
Can't you see
she's not lying?

33:49.393 --> 33:51.495
-Logan!
-Come on, we should just...

33:51.528 --> 33:52.397
Let's just do it!

33:54.131 --> 33:55.666
( whimpers )

33:55.700 --> 33:59.570
Logan:<i> Please.
Listen to her, okay?
She's telling the truth.</i>

34:00.705 --> 34:01.572
<i> Please.</i>

34:06.610 --> 34:08.912
-What are you doing?
-I could've killed you.

34:08.945 --> 34:11.415
<i>I shot the wrong person once...</i>

34:11.448 --> 34:12.784
I can't make
the same mistake.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.323
Abigail: ( on radio )<i> Shun?
We need you to bring
Katie back, alive.</i>

34:19.357 --> 34:23.227
<i>Henri has a test
that'll tell if she's infected.</i>

34:30.868 --> 34:36.741
We've established the parasite
and host share a symbiotic
relationship.

34:36.774 --> 34:41.445
-If the person dies...
-Shun: The alien does, too.

34:41.479 --> 34:44.648
The saline should lower
the body temperature enough
to mimic death.

34:44.682 --> 34:47.718
"Mimic death"?
That sounds pretty
conclusively like death to me.

34:51.355 --> 34:53.190
So this is gonna stop
the protocol, right?

34:53.223 --> 34:54.358
If she's infected.

34:57.861 --> 34:59.363
Well, the scans are repeating.

34:59.397 --> 35:01.265
If it's anything like
the other fail-safes,

35:01.298 --> 35:04.035
the ship will know when
the problem has been rectified.

35:04.068 --> 35:07.671
Henri, are you sure
you can bring her back?

35:07.705 --> 35:11.242
We have approximately
12 minutes to revive her.

35:11.275 --> 35:15.612
But, as I said,
so much of this
is theoretical.

35:15.646 --> 35:18.916
Fuck are you talking about?
This is insane, all right?
There's no way...

35:18.949 --> 35:19.884
I'll do it.

35:20.584 --> 35:21.452
What?

35:23.187 --> 35:25.890
We're all in this mess
because of me, Logan.

35:25.923 --> 35:28.860
I'm not letting you risk your
life. I know it's not you.

35:30.127 --> 35:31.696
-I know.
-No.

35:32.763 --> 35:34.165
But I have to do this.

35:35.166 --> 35:36.234
I'll take the test.

35:36.933 --> 35:38.136
Fuck me.

35:39.136 --> 35:40.371
Are you sure?

35:43.507 --> 35:46.611
Are you sure you
understand the dangers?

35:53.451 --> 35:54.452
All right.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.721
Let's try it.

35:57.488 --> 35:59.157
( heart monitor beeping )

36:02.093 --> 36:05.295
Abigail, prep a timer
for 12 minutes.

36:05.329 --> 36:06.397
Set it for when she...

36:09.066 --> 36:10.268
Abigail: Okay.

36:15.439 --> 36:16.440
Hey.

36:17.474 --> 36:19.944
-Come back to me.
-I'm not scared.

36:23.847 --> 36:25.183
I'm not scared.

36:50.774 --> 36:52.777
( gasping )

37:17.634 --> 37:19.670
( flatlining )

37:28.813 --> 37:30.314
( object clatters )

37:30.348 --> 37:32.550
Andy, I'm sorry.

37:36.153 --> 37:37.587
I must have missed
the check-in.

37:37.621 --> 37:39.824
I didn't realize
they would send
something out this far!

37:42.226 --> 37:43.527
( door closes )

37:46.096 --> 37:47.598
( tapping on window )

37:55.773 --> 37:57.908
-What is this place?
-You'll see.

37:58.809 --> 37:59.844
You'll see.

38:03.013 --> 38:04.482
( chuckles )

38:08.118 --> 38:09.987
Why did you decide
to jailbreak me?

38:11.088 --> 38:13.591
It's nice to find
another misfit
in this place.

38:15.192 --> 38:17.828
Besides, I had an idea.

38:24.234 --> 38:27.438
<i>Just so you know,
they'll crucify me for taking
them out without permission.</i>

38:28.305 --> 38:29.440
Thank you.

38:31.675 --> 38:32.877
Oh, my God.

38:34.611 --> 38:36.447
Oh, they're
so beautiful.

38:38.148 --> 38:39.684
-( horse nickers )
-Hello.

38:40.951 --> 38:43.487
-Hi.
-I saw the drone.

38:44.521 --> 38:45.856
I wish you hadn't.

38:45.890 --> 38:48.192
Sean:<i> Nothing like that's
ever come out this far.</i>

38:48.225 --> 38:50.828
<i> Someone must
have really wanted
to track you down.</i>

38:52.296 --> 38:53.831
What'd you do, Katie?

38:55.532 --> 38:57.434
-I can't.
<i> -Come on.</i>

38:57.468 --> 38:59.003
I'm the last person
who's gonna judge you.

38:59.036 --> 39:00.404
I said I can't.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.510
All I ever do is try
to run away from it, but...

39:08.379 --> 39:10.448
This time I really
thought I could settle.

39:11.982 --> 39:13.451
You know what I've realized?

39:14.318 --> 39:16.753
You can't evade
your own shadow.

39:16.787 --> 39:21.158
You can go as far or as fast
as you like, but it's always
gonna be there.

39:21.191 --> 39:24.562
If you don't learn to embrace
it, you'll never stop running.

39:26.096 --> 39:27.064
Is that what you did?

39:28.632 --> 39:29.967
Would I be here if I had?

39:38.442 --> 39:39.744
So let's run together.

39:54.391 --> 39:55.593
Oh, I miss this.

39:56.427 --> 39:57.661
I'll race you.

39:58.329 --> 39:59.797
-Come on!
-Sean: Come on!

40:03.367 --> 40:04.535
Katie: Come on!

40:07.170 --> 40:08.506
Katie:<i> Whoo!</i>

40:24.822 --> 40:26.223
Katie!

40:26.256 --> 40:27.958
<i>Katie, slow down!</i>

40:32.663 --> 40:33.998
-( gasps )
-( horse neighs )

40:34.798 --> 40:36.200
( flatlining )

40:47.811 --> 40:49.079
( Logan breathing heavily )

40:50.447 --> 40:51.515
How long's it been?

40:51.815 --> 40:53.149
Uh...

40:53.183 --> 40:55.685
-Nearly seven minutes.
-How come there hasn't
been another scan?

40:55.719 --> 40:57.054
-It will happen.
-Logan:<i> Yeah, when?</i>

40:57.087 --> 40:58.522
Just wait! Please, wait.

40:59.255 --> 41:00.558
( grunts in frustration )

41:05.695 --> 41:07.598
-( alarm blaring )
-( blaring )

41:13.436 --> 41:15.806
Logan:<i> What does it say?</i>

41:15.839 --> 41:18.108
-It hasn't stopped.
-Yeah, because
she's not infected!

41:19.243 --> 41:21.411
I told you, right?
It's not her!

41:21.445 --> 41:23.480
Maybe we should
wait a little longer.

41:23.514 --> 41:25.616
Fuck you, okay!
She's not the alien!

41:25.649 --> 41:27.985
Doc, bring her back, okay?
Bring her back, please.

41:30.487 --> 41:33.524
-I'm doing it. Adrenalin.
-Abigail: Okay.

41:36.293 --> 41:37.661
( injects )

41:39.597 --> 41:42.800
-Why is nothing happening?
-Just wait one moment!

41:48.605 --> 41:49.673
It's not working, Henri.

41:50.807 --> 41:52.877
Just bring her back,
please, Doc. Please.

41:54.310 --> 41:55.880
-Another one.
-Yeah.

42:00.116 --> 42:02.419
-( rapid beeping )
-Henri:<i> Heart spasms!</i>

42:02.453 --> 42:04.254
-Defibrillator.
-Logan:<i> No, no, no!</i>

42:04.287 --> 42:05.889
No, Kate.
Please, please.

42:05.923 --> 42:07.758
-( device powers up )
-Move!

42:12.395 --> 42:13.797
( flatlining )

42:14.632 --> 42:15.532
( sobbing ) No.

42:15.566 --> 42:16.600
( grunting )

42:16.633 --> 42:18.636
-No.
-Henri: Come on, Kate.

42:21.972 --> 42:22.973
Come on, Kate.

43:05.215 --> 43:06.183
What did you do?
( sniffles )

43:24.767 --> 43:26.303
-( beeps )
-( gasps )

43:29.807 --> 43:31.842
-( Abigail gasps )
-Logan:<i> Yes.</i>

43:33.243 --> 43:35.278
( steady beeping )

43:35.311 --> 43:37.181
Yes. Yes.

43:37.214 --> 43:38.215
It's okay.
( sniffles )

43:38.615 --> 43:39.683
You're okay.

43:47.991 --> 43:48.926
( gasps )

44:10.180 --> 44:11.048
Logan: It's okay.

44:23.126 --> 44:24.161
( groans )

44:35.105 --> 44:35.973
Andy?

44:41.177 --> 44:42.146
What happened?

44:43.413 --> 44:44.314
You fell.

44:47.083 --> 44:48.651
Where is he?

44:48.685 --> 44:51.188
He's gone.
We told him to leave.

44:51.221 --> 44:53.891
-You had no right to do that.
-No, you had no right.

44:54.557 --> 44:56.193
What were you thinking?

44:56.226 --> 44:57.894
Riding out with a stranger
when you haven't been on
a horse in years.

44:57.928 --> 44:59.363
That's why I did it.

45:00.197 --> 45:02.132
I wanted something back.

45:02.165 --> 45:04.100
Something from before
that was good.

45:04.134 --> 45:06.169
You promised
to live by my rules,

45:06.203 --> 45:08.972
but all you've done is break
what I've tried to build here.

45:09.005 --> 45:11.975
Isn't it built on a lie, Andy?

45:12.008 --> 45:17.715
We hated the idea of God
and now, what, you're some
kind of religious leader?

45:21.117 --> 45:23.453
I knew you
wouldn't understand.

45:23.487 --> 45:25.589
Because you're
pretending, Andy.

45:25.622 --> 45:28.592
-This isn't you.
-You don't know who I am!

45:28.625 --> 45:31.795
<i>You've been out of my life
for years...</i>

45:33.396 --> 45:34.364
We are strangers.

45:35.732 --> 45:37.835
You are not a stranger to me.

45:40.003 --> 45:42.973
<i> You never wanted
me back, did you?</i>

45:46.543 --> 45:48.212
I can't do it. I can't forget.

45:48.245 --> 45:51.314
-I never asked you to forget.
<i> -But you're here,</i>

45:51.348 --> 45:54.851
and you wanna live with me
and be part of this life,

45:54.885 --> 45:56.253
like we just bury the past.

45:56.286 --> 46:00.057
I'm paying for what
I did every day,

46:00.957 --> 46:02.493
but it's a part of me now.

46:05.829 --> 46:07.131
He was a child.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.502
He was just a child.

46:12.368 --> 46:13.904
( fire crackling )

46:17.174 --> 46:18.242
So was I.

46:27.651 --> 46:30.120
I never meant for it to happen.

46:36.293 --> 46:38.661
You've always said that,

46:38.694 --> 46:42.265
but you woke up that morning
knowing you were going
to go after him.

46:42.299 --> 46:44.367
You woke up knowing
you were going to hurt him.

46:44.401 --> 46:47.304
( sobbing ) I thought
I was protecting you!

46:49.406 --> 46:51.241
He made your life miserable,

46:52.843 --> 46:54.177
and you tried to hurt yourself.

46:54.210 --> 46:57.380
You knew he was in there,
you knew he wouldn't get out.

46:57.414 --> 47:00.284
-That's not true.
-You killed him, Rachel.

47:05.455 --> 47:07.457
( mouths ) No!

47:13.196 --> 47:14.264
( sniffles )

47:17.568 --> 47:18.902
There is this

47:21.705 --> 47:22.840
darkness in you,

47:26.209 --> 47:27.978
<i> and it has always been there,</i>

47:30.180 --> 47:32.850
and I can't pretend
I don't see it.

47:47.597 --> 47:49.032
Do you believe in forgiveness?

47:54.271 --> 47:55.138
Yes.

47:58.408 --> 47:59.610
Can you forgive me?

48:15.459 --> 48:16.326
No.

48:18.494 --> 48:20.631
( fire crackling )

49:16.352 --> 49:20.090
-We are never doing
that again, ever.
-( chuckles )

49:24.461 --> 49:25.696
Henri:<i> Katie...</i>

49:27.297 --> 49:28.498
I'm so sorry.

49:29.766 --> 49:31.201
At least you all know.

49:34.137 --> 49:35.672
( alarm blaring )

49:42.111 --> 49:44.614
Rey:<i> Why would SIREN do this?</i>

49:44.647 --> 49:47.484
There has to be something.
They knew something.

49:52.221 --> 49:53.790
Rey, where are you going?

49:53.823 --> 49:55.125
Captain's cabin.

49:56.793 --> 49:57.661
So that's it.

49:59.028 --> 50:00.931
We're all just gonna
roll over and die.

50:00.964 --> 50:02.832
We can't give up yet.

50:02.866 --> 50:04.367
Thea is right there.

50:04.400 --> 50:07.104
If we can't stop this thing,
can't we at least try
to survive it?

50:08.037 --> 50:10.407
Oh, wow,
that's a great plan.

50:11.141 --> 50:12.575
And who made you invincible?

50:12.608 --> 50:14.044
( sniffles )

50:16.079 --> 50:17.414
( exhales )

50:18.849 --> 50:20.050
It's been great.

50:23.186 --> 50:25.322
Baum, what are you gonna do?

50:26.656 --> 50:27.524
Baum!

50:28.692 --> 50:29.559
Great.

50:30.827 --> 50:32.662
Rey? Rey?

50:32.695 --> 50:34.164
Rey, what are you doing?

50:34.197 --> 50:37.333
Rey: I gave up my life
for this mission.
Taylor died for this mission,

50:37.366 --> 50:40.303
but now I'm not sure either of
us even knew who SIREN were.

50:40.336 --> 50:42.538
Abigail:<i> Okay,
what are we looking for?</i>

50:42.572 --> 50:44.141
( breathing heavily )

50:47.244 --> 50:48.812
( hologram beeping )

50:54.484 --> 50:55.519
Wow.

50:57.954 --> 50:59.055
What is this?

50:59.088 --> 51:00.757
Thea's solar system.

51:02.959 --> 51:04.161
There it is.

51:10.300 --> 51:11.168
Wait.

51:14.004 --> 51:15.304
( speaking French )

51:15.337 --> 51:17.273
What? What?
What's wrong?

51:17.306 --> 51:18.809
This planet,
it doesn't exist.

51:20.543 --> 51:21.544
I don't...

51:21.577 --> 51:23.246
I've studied
this solar system
1,000 times.

51:24.147 --> 51:25.816
There's no such planet as Iris.

51:28.418 --> 51:30.086
Lana:<i> The gas is into Ring 5!</i>

51:30.120 --> 51:32.122
<i> We need to do something, now.</i>

51:37.293 --> 51:40.197
-What is it?
-This poison's
airborne, right?

51:41.030 --> 51:42.565
Yeah.

51:42.599 --> 51:45.135
So the best chance we have
is to stop ourselves
breathing it in.

51:47.336 --> 51:48.438
How the hell do we do that?

51:50.406 --> 51:53.476
We need all the oxygen supplies
we can gather.

51:53.510 --> 51:56.346
There were backup tanks
in Ring 4. We're gonna
have to be fast.

51:59.181 --> 52:00.483
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

52:00.516 --> 52:02.419
-What are you doing?
-I wanna help.

52:03.319 --> 52:05.789
Kate, you just died.
Take it easy.

52:07.624 --> 52:08.492
What?

52:10.526 --> 52:13.630
I know you feel like
I owe you an explanation

52:13.663 --> 52:15.698
about why I was so desperate
to hide my past...

52:15.732 --> 52:18.602
I know everything
that I need to know about you.

52:30.380 --> 52:33.116
How could SIREN have hid
an entire planet from you?

52:33.149 --> 52:34.651
Well, the real question is why.

52:35.518 --> 52:36.720
( beeps )

52:46.096 --> 52:49.166
-What is the Iris Incident?
-I have no idea.

52:52.802 --> 52:54.804
<i> -Shit. They went there.</i>
-Abigail:<i> Who?</i>

52:54.838 --> 52:58.275
-SIREN. SIREN went to Iris.
-Why would they keep
that a secret?

52:58.674 --> 52:59.776
<i>Rey?</i>

53:04.614 --> 53:05.615
What?

53:06.583 --> 53:08.652
-Rey, what does that mean?
-No one came back!

53:14.690 --> 53:15.959
( gasps )

53:22.832 --> 53:23.833
Oh, my God.

53:28.771 --> 53:29.773
<i>Oh, my God.</i>
