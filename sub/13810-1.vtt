09:27.233 --> 09:28.818
LOOKS LIKE WE LOST SAM AGAIN.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.861
THE GAME STARTS IN 15 MINUTES.

09:30.945 --> 09:33.030
WE CAN'T PLAY WITHOUT THE SQUID.

09:33.114 --> 09:36.784
I GUESS THE GEEK
COULDN'T KEEP UP AGAIN.

09:36.867 --> 09:37.660
GEEK?

09:37.743 --> 09:39.036
WHAT DID YOU CALL HIM?

09:39.120 --> 09:40.746
I'M SURE I CAN
TAKE HIS PLACE.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.331
STREET HOCKEY'S
MY SPECIALTY.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.583
YOU'LL NEVER TAKE HIS PLACE.

{\an1}WE WOULDN'T
EVEN BE TALKING.

09:50.172 --> 09:52.383
{\an5}THOUGH I CAN'T
FIGURE OUT WHY
SAM LIKES YOU.

09:52.466 --> 09:54.760
{\an4}WHY HAVE YOU BEEN
TREATING THE SQUID
LIKE CRUD?

09:54.844 --> 09:56.429
HEY, I WAS JUST MESSING AROUND.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.472
MESSING AROUND WITH OUR FRIEND.

{\an1}I THINK I'LL JUST
TAKE THE "O".

13:34.563 --> 13:35.439
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY.

13:35.523 --> 13:36.815
IT'S THE RULES
OF THE GAME.

13:36.899 --> 13:39.568
THAT IS, UNLESS YOU'RE
A LITTLE CHICKEN BOY.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.570
(<i> cackling like chicken</i> )

14:07.888 --> 14:09.598
WHOA-HO-HO...

14:09.682 --> 14:11.267
{\an1}TWIST, YOU SHOULD HAVE
GONE FIRST.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.935
OTTO COULD NEVER
HAVE DONE THAT.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.270
NICE ONE, TWIST.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.939
I NEVER KNEW CHICKENS
COULD FLY LIKE THAT.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.608
I DON'T THINK I WANT
TO SKATE ANYMORE.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.818
(<i> cackling</i> )

14:20.901 --> 14:21.777
OTTO, STOP.

14:21.860 --> 14:23.779
CAN'T YOU SEE
HE'S FREAKED OUT?

14:23.862 --> 14:25.781
{\an1}TWISTER, YOU QUIT,
YOU LOSE.

14:25.864 --> 14:27.616
I DON'T LOSE!

14:27.700 --> 14:30.953
I'M JUST PUTTING
THE GAME ON PAUSE.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.624
FINE! I LOSE!

14:35.708 --> 14:37.793
I GOT TO GO...

HEY, TWISTER

14:47.553 --> 14:48.804
WE'RE NOT DONE PLAYING.

14:48.887 --> 14:50.973
I DON'T THINK TWISTER
WAS PLAYING, OTTO.

14:51.056 --> 14:51.974
I HOPE HE'S OKAY.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.393
YEAH, HE LOOKED REALLY TWEAKED.

14:54.476 --> 14:56.061
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.479
DON'T TELL HIM I SAID THAT.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.648
HE'S JUST BEING A SORE LOSER.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.150
I KNOW TWISTER.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.361

BEGGING FOR A REMATCH.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.572
Reggie:
Are you sure you're okay?

15:06.655 --> 15:08.157
OTTO'S SO WILD SOMETIMES.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.702
I JUST CAN'T ALWAYS DO
THE STUFF HE WANTS ME TO DO.

15:11.785 --> 15:12.661
WELCOME TO MY WORLD.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.163
I GOT TO LIVE WITH HIM.

TO SOUND LIKE OTTO.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.563
THIS IS OTTO, YOU DORK.

15:39.647 --> 15:40.773
WHAT'S THE DEAL?

15:40.856 --> 15:43.192
{\an1}I'D FEEL SAFER

SHOW OFF ALL THE TIME.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.476
IT'S NOT SHOWING OFF
WHEN YOU'RE THE BEST.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.228
YEAH, RIGHT.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.907
You've got to try.

19:59.990 --> 20:00.949
It's the rules of the game.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.994
That is, unless you're
a little chicken boy.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.094
LIKE BEST BUDS DO.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.179
{\an1}OH, YEAH?

22:02.487 --> 22:03.405
YOU WON'T.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.614
YOU'RE A GREAT SKATER.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.491
THINK HOW COOL
THE SHOT WILL LOOK

22:06.575 --> 22:08.076
FROM THE HELMET CAM'S
POINT OF VIEW.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.953
YOU'LL NAIL
A GOOD GRADE FOR SURE

22:10.037 --> 22:11.830

WHOMP MYSELF AGAIN.

22:11.913 --> 22:13.749
