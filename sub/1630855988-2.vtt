Lawn Tennis Tournament

12:36.796 --> 12:37.897
on the 12th,

12:37.897 --> 12:39.626
so I'll have to
take the day off.

12:39.626 --> 12:41.367
A friend of mine from Harvard
is playing,

12:41.367 --> 12:42.902
and I've sworn to be there.

12:42.902 --> 12:44.771

when I was last at the casino.

12:44.771 --> 12:46.739

of any kind,

out of the habit.

Well, then they'll be glad
to see Mrs. Blane.

I'll come for you at 2:00.

Make it 12:00, and I'll give
you some luncheon first.

13:03.055 --> 13:04.958

the rooms upstairs.

13:15.401 --> 13:19.038

is too old to watch tennis.

13:19.038 --> 13:21.040
I just didn't want her to be
trapped in a crowd

13:21.040 --> 13:22.808

from Harvard.

13:22.808 --> 13:24.510
Oh, I think she'll enjoy it.

13:24.510 --> 13:28.881
By the way, I've had an idea
which could be useful for you

13:28.881 --> 13:30.249
in the opera war.

13:30.249 --> 13:32.118
You better not tell
Mrs. Astor.

13:32.118 --> 13:35.321
Dear lady, I am only
sharing information.

Mrs. Astor about it.

13:37.824 --> 13:39.292
Mm, mm.

13:39.292 --> 13:41.728

of Joshua Winterton?

13:41.728 --> 13:43.829
He has old money

13:43.829 --> 13:46.298
and one of the first cottages
to be built here.

13:46.298 --> 13:48.333
Anyway, he's been
a widower for years

13:48.333 --> 13:52.137
and now has astonished the town
by getting married

13:52.137 --> 13:54.173
after a short engagement--
- Oh?

13:54.173 --> 13:56.875
So short in fact that
no one has met her yet.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.078
[chuckles] Doesn't he have
a box at the Academy?

13:59.078 --> 14:01.280
Why would they want to get
involved with the opera war?

14:01.280 --> 14:03.249
He has one, yes.

14:03.249 --> 14:06.285
But I'm told his wife is young
and likes to play,

14:06.285 --> 14:09.822
so she may find the Academy
crowd a little stuffy.

14:09.822 --> 14:11.256
- Hmm.
- And there's no reason

14:11.256 --> 14:14.126
why they couldn't take a box
at the Metropolitan as well.

14:14.126 --> 14:16.028
Hmm,
and he has money, you say?

14:16.028 --> 14:18.931
Oh, lots and lots

14:18.931 --> 14:22.135
I'll introduce you when I give
my ball at the casino.

She's invited the new rector
of St. Thomas Church

So when did your family

to Boston in 1794.

15:19.792 --> 15:21.560
He saw Europe
going up in flames

after the French Revolution and
wanted to avoid the carnage.

15:25.230 --> 15:27.900
We cannot criticize him

- Why Boston?
- You're right.

It wasn't the obvious choice.
We were Italian, not Irish.

But my father was Catholic,
so there's some logic to it.

clutches of the vicar of Rome?

- Not yet.

meet Henderson,
find out what he really wants.

18:48.201 --> 18:50.136

Power is very seductive,
I'm told.

a man of principle.
