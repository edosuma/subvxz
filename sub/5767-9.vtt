01:34.890 --> 01:38.553
Alicia Florrick
and Will Gardner, please.

01:38.590 --> 01:40.148
MAN:
12 counts
of murder.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.758
WILL:
12? 12 murders?

01:41.800 --> 01:42.869
Yes.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.219
I...

01:44.270 --> 01:46.864
What did your client do,
shoot up the base?

01:46.900 --> 01:49.209
Sergeant Elkins works
in the UAS division.

01:49.240 --> 01:50.229
UAS?

01:50.270 --> 01:51.601
Unmanned Aerial Systems.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.198
Drones.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.470
Sergeant Elkins is charged
with disobeying orders

01:55.510 --> 01:57.501
and firing
two Hellfire missiles

01:57.550 --> 01:59.177
on 12 unarmed citizens

01:59.220 --> 02:00.312
in Waziristan,
Afghanistan.

02:00.350 --> 02:01.510
And you're defending him?

02:01.550 --> 02:02.812
Her. Yes.

02:02.850 --> 02:04.784
So, why do
you need us?
We're still

02:04.820 --> 02:07.209
not very qualified to
assist in military court.

02:07.260 --> 02:08.818
You did it
once before.

02:08.860 --> 02:10.327
Yes, but not very well.

02:10.360 --> 02:12.419
Well, that is debatable.

02:12.460 --> 02:14.223
Due to the seriousness
of the charge,

02:14.260 --> 02:15.693
Sergeant Elkins
is insisting

02:15.730 --> 02:16.697
on civilian support,

02:16.730 --> 02:19.335
and I thought you would
do the least damage.

02:19.370 --> 02:20.598
Sorry.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.891
I didn't mean
it that way.

02:21.940 --> 02:24.261
I am so sorry, Captain,
we would love to help.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.299
She has money
from her family.

02:25.340 --> 02:27.570
(phone rings)
Would you excuse me?

02:27.610 --> 02:28.770
I'll be right back.

02:33.980 --> 02:35.641
Yeah? What are you finding out?

02:35.680 --> 02:37.648
KALINDA: _
You're being Investigated.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.180
Thanks, Kalinda.

02:39.220 --> 02:40.118
Anything else?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.219
State's attorney's office
wants to use you

02:42.260 --> 02:43.329
to get to Lemond Bishop.

02:43.360 --> 02:45.351
I know. If we drop him
as a client,

02:45.390 --> 02:46.823
will they back off?
Look, don't...

02:46.860 --> 02:48.293
(whispering):
Kalinda, come on.

02:48.330 --> 02:49.922
Don't worry, they're
backing off anyway.

02:49.970 --> 02:52.268
Peter's no longer in charge
of the investigation.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.188
He... what?

02:54.240 --> 02:56.299
Yeah, he's worried about
conflict of interest.

02:56.340 --> 02:58.228
His wife working under you.

02:58.270 --> 02:59.737
He really
backed out?

02:59.780 --> 03:01.008
Yeah.

03:01.040 --> 03:04.407
I hear someone confronted him
about this conflict of interest.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.611
So, who is in charge?

03:06.650 --> 03:08.515
My guess is Cary.

03:08.550 --> 03:10.882
So that's your source
on this? Cary?

03:10.920 --> 03:12.387
No, someone close to him.

03:12.420 --> 03:14.980
Someone else
on the Investigation.

03:15.020 --> 03:16.829
So, you think I can exhale?

03:16.860 --> 03:19.249
I think you dodged a bullet.
WOMAN:
Miss Sharma?

03:19.300 --> 03:20.653
Hello.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.497
Who was that?

03:22.530 --> 03:23.690
No idea.

03:23.730 --> 03:25.266
Where are you again?

03:25.300 --> 03:26.198
D.C.

03:26.240 --> 03:29.437
Oh, yes. Cheese,
our most important client.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.301
Tell Eli not to screw
this one up.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.534
We lose cheese,
we lose our quarter.

03:32.580 --> 03:33.808
Will do.

03:33.840 --> 03:37.139
Now, go exhale,
do something nice for someone.

03:41.020 --> 03:42.442
You know, Captain,

03:42.490 --> 03:45.618
we might be able
to work something out.

03:45.650 --> 03:47.652
DIANE:
We thank the USDA for their time

03:47.690 --> 03:50.557
as they reconsider which food
guide to recommend to Congress.

03:50.590 --> 03:53.320
Our argument is simple.

03:53.360 --> 03:55.521
Go back to the pyramid.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.324
The old food guide
was simple, bold,

03:58.370 --> 04:00.292
understandable.

04:00.340 --> 04:02.501
We have witnesses here today,
schoolteachers, parents,

04:02.540 --> 04:03.905
who will testify that

04:03.940 --> 04:05.737
children could easily
grasp its pictures...

04:05.770 --> 04:07.408
That's
the schoolteacher?
Yeah.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.668
She looks like
a Bond girl.

04:08.710 --> 04:09.802
She's a fifth grade
schoolteacher.

04:09.850 --> 04:12.318
I don't care, she doesn't
look like a schoolteacher.

04:12.350 --> 04:14.045
They won't listen unless
she looks like one.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.310
Tell her to put a
sweater on or something.

04:16.350 --> 04:17.544
What?
Hold on, hold on.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.784
DIANE:
The new design...

04:18.820 --> 04:20.856
(whispering):
Give me your glasses.

04:20.890 --> 04:23.324
Give me
your glasses.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.021
Um, the-the new design,

04:25.060 --> 04:27.358
MyPlate, is confusing.
Give her this.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.719
Go on.
What are grains?

04:28.760 --> 04:30.728
What is protein?

04:30.770 --> 04:31.919
We would argue that this

04:31.970 --> 04:33.767
is the result
of aggressive lobbying

04:33.800 --> 04:35.290
by the produce council.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.898
MAN:
As opposed
to aggressive lobbying

04:36.940 --> 04:38.464
by the cheese council.

04:38.510 --> 04:39.704
DIANE:
We don't deny that

04:39.740 --> 04:42.447
we are lobbying,
Undersecretary Brattle,

04:42.480 --> 04:45.005
but we would deny that
that's all that we're doing.

04:45.050 --> 04:48.076
Um, as you can hear
from a Miss Vickie Evans,

04:48.120 --> 04:50.816
a schoolteacher from Nebraska...

04:55.020 --> 04:56.009
Uh, she can talk

04:56.060 --> 04:59.052
of the difficulties
that she has with MyPl...

04:59.090 --> 05:01.354
Why don't we just say
what this is really about?

05:01.400 --> 05:03.368
Cheese.
You've lost

05:03.400 --> 05:05.868
$2 billion a year
because of the new,
more accurate guide.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.333
Are you kidding?

05:07.370 --> 05:08.667
More accurate?

05:08.700 --> 05:09.906
You have dairy in a cup!

05:09.940 --> 05:11.635
How is that accurate?
It's not a cup,

05:11.670 --> 05:13.331
it's a smaller ci_rcle.
You drink milk

05:13.380 --> 05:14.733
in a cup, y-you don't
drink cheese...

05:14.780 --> 05:16.475
There was no room on the plate.
What are you

05:16.510 --> 05:18.899
talking about? It's a cartoon,
it's not a real plate.

05:18.950 --> 05:20.076
Who's paying you off?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.576
(gavel banging)
The produce council?

05:21.620 --> 05:23.383
MAN:
Okay, thank you, everyone.

05:23.420 --> 05:24.489
We will discuss this

05:24.520 --> 05:25.680
in executive session,

05:25.720 --> 05:27.449
make our recommendations
to Congress.

05:27.490 --> 05:28.582
ELI:
Hey.

05:28.620 --> 05:29.882
What's going on
with your boss?

05:29.930 --> 05:31.454
Don't worry, Secretary Henshaw's
still with you.

05:31.490 --> 05:33.048
He has to affect neutrality.
We were supposed

05:33.100 --> 05:34.192
to get a yes on the pyramid.

05:34.230 --> 05:36.027
He didn't expect the brush-back
from the undersecretary,

05:36.060 --> 05:37.095
that's all.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.620
Is he trying to shake us down?

05:38.670 --> 05:39.762
(chuckles)
Oh, yes, Chicago.

05:39.800 --> 05:40.835
Immw.

05:40.870 --> 05:42.599
The secretary
doesn't "shake down."

05:42.640 --> 05:43.937
He's on your side.

05:43.970 --> 05:45.904
This is going
to Congress next week.

05:45.940 --> 05:47.476
The pyramid will be reinstated.

05:47.510 --> 05:48.579
Trust me.

05:49.980 --> 05:51.777
That's the
secretary's aide?

05:51.810 --> 05:53.744
Yeah, why?
Well, how does
she know me?

05:53.780 --> 05:55.748
She doesn't know you.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.363
FEMALE AIDE (laughs):
Well, I'm not that popular...

06:12.540 --> 06:14.030
KALINDA: _
Oh, good, I was Just making sure

06:14.070 --> 06:16.402
our gift arrived.

06:18.140 --> 06:21.473
(soldiers singing cadence)

06:21.510 --> 06:23.102
MAN:
Sergeant Elkins
receiving counsel.

06:23.150 --> 06:25.141
Ten-hut!
(door opens)

06:27.750 --> 06:29.911
HICKS:
At ease, Sergeant.
Yes, sir.

06:29.950 --> 06:31.781
These are the two civilian
lawyers I discussed.

06:31.820 --> 06:33.412
Will Gardner,
Alicia Florrick,

06:33.460 --> 06:34.210
from Lockhart/Gardner.

06:34.260 --> 06:36.114
Hello, Gina.
Do you want to sit?

06:36.160 --> 06:37.627
No, sir, thank you.

06:37.660 --> 06:39.127
Okay.

06:39.160 --> 06:41.993
If you don't mind, we will.

06:42.030 --> 06:44.169
So, these...

06:44.200 --> 06:46.168
murder counts,

06:46.200 --> 06:47.838
they are all based
on your work

06:47.870 --> 06:49.508
at the Predator
UAS installation

06:49.540 --> 06:50.666
in...
Nevada.

06:50.710 --> 06:52.063
Addis Air Eorce
Base, Sir.

06:52.110 --> 06:54.499
And you do what there?

06:54.540 --> 06:55.734
I am a UAV
operator.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.702
I read and_ react
to real-time

06:57.750 --> 06:59.547
on-the-ground alterations as
detected by the UAV sensors

06:59.580 --> 07:01.616
and control the Predator
targeting systems.

07:01.650 --> 07:02.787
The missiles?

07:02.820 --> 07:04.139
Yes, ma'am.

07:04.190 --> 07:07.079
Your commanding officer
accuses you of inaccurate

07:07.120 --> 07:08.758
and unprofessional
reporting as to
the presence

07:08.790 --> 07:11.520
of 12 unarmed civilians,
resulting in their deaths.

07:11.560 --> 07:13.152
Yes, sir, that is accurate.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.952
It's accurate that
that happened?

07:15.000 --> 07:17.525
Uh, no, sir, it-it's
accurate as to the charge.

07:17.570 --> 07:18.662
I see.

07:18.700 --> 07:20.998
So... what happened?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.462
I wish you would sit down.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.501
I'd rather
not, Sir.

07:24.540 --> 07:26.929
There are occasional delays in
the transmission of text alerts

07:26.980 --> 07:30.006
and sensor relays; I received
the information too late, sir.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.540
The transmission is
logged as on time,

07:31.580 --> 07:33.241
because it indicates
the time it was sent

07:33.280 --> 07:34.315
but_not the time
it arrived.

07:34.350 --> 07:36.614
Is there someone who
can corroborate that, Gina?

07:36.650 --> 07:38.845
Ma'am, I-I don't
understand the question.

07:38.890 --> 07:42.678
Is there someone who_ saw
the delay in the transmissmn?

07:42.730 --> 07:45.824
Yes, ma'am. As I
already informed

07:45.860 --> 07:47.794
Captain Hicks, my
pilot saw it, too.

07:47.830 --> 07:48.956
Lieutenant Ventura.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.126
The pilot in the drone?

07:50.170 --> 07:51.819
No, ma'am, on
the ground.

07:51.870 --> 07:54.964
We remotely operate the
Predator UAV from Nevada.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.264
Well, maybe we
can interview him.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.507
Unfortunately, military justice
moves very swiftly.

08:00.540 --> 08:03.043
So we're struggling to catch up.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.503
Uh, are you...?

08:05.550 --> 08:08.212
Go ahead, Sergeant,
ask the question.

08:08.250 --> 08:11.048
Are-are you taking my case, sir?

08:11.090 --> 08:13.558
Do you want us
to take your case?

08:14.720 --> 08:16.551
I do.

08:16.590 --> 08:19.081
Then yes.

08:23.900 --> 08:25.868
She looks like
she's 15 years old.

08:25.900 --> 08:27.265
She's terrified.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.188
One thing I
don't understand,

08:29.240 --> 08:30.969
is why are they
prosecuting this?

08:31.010 --> 08:33.308
I mean, there must be
hundreds of civilian deaths

08:33.340 --> 08:34.568
in similar drone mishaps.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.305
Why prosecute
this one?

08:36.340 --> 08:38.205
I have no answer
for that.

08:38.250 --> 08:42.914
Okay, let's get to this pilot,
Lieutenant Ventura.

08:42.950 --> 08:45.248
Get me the dairy people
on the phone, all of them.

08:45.290 --> 08:46.109
Where did you go?

08:46.150 --> 08:48.618
I need your help
with the produce people.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.322
Heard they got a new
lobbyist, and I heard
he's as good as me.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.089
She is.

08:53.130 --> 08:54.722
VVho?

08:54.760 --> 08:56.022
Secretary's aide,
Stacie Hall.

08:56.060 --> 08:57.288
She flipped sides.

08:57.330 --> 08:58.991
No conference call,
I'll call them later!

08:59.030 --> 09:00.167
Are you sure?

09:00.200 --> 09:02.191
Yep, she played you, Eli.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.629
She left the USDA
to become a lobbyist
for the produce people.

09:04.670 --> 09:06.035
Produce or fruit?
FrUIt.

09:06.070 --> 09:08.072
USDA never intended to
go back to the pyramid.

09:08.110 --> 09:10.647
They were just trying
to shake down the Dairy Guild.

09:10.680 --> 09:11.669
(phone rings)

09:12.310 --> 09:15.279
Oh, I'll be back.

09:15.320 --> 09:18.187
Having a hard time
staying away from me?

09:18.220 --> 09:20.814
Yep, you are just
irresistible, Kalinda.

09:20.860 --> 09:22.009
So, what's up?

09:22.060 --> 09:23.982
I need a meeting
with Diane Lockhart.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.349
Really? Why?

09:25.390 --> 09:26.994
Our investigation
into Will Gardner.

09:27.030 --> 09:28.349
I thought you guys
were winding down.

09:28.400 --> 09:29.594
We are.

09:29.630 --> 09:32.098
Just... dotting a few I's.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.939
All right. I'll see
what I can do,

09:33.970 --> 09:36.291
and you'll tell me when the
investigation heats up again.

09:36.340 --> 09:38.103
Oh, you will be my first call.

09:38.140 --> 09:40.608
You want me_ out
of your chair?

09:40.640 --> 09:41.800
No, stay comfortable.

09:41.840 --> 09:43.376
Who was that?

09:43.410 --> 09:45.241
Kalinda.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.214
Really?
Yes.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.047
How nice for you two.
Oh, yes.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.616
She is quite the
conversationalist.

09:50.650 --> 09:51.844
She's definitely that.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.118
We're gonna
stay in touch.

09:53.160 --> 09:55.014
Got her on
speed-dial, have you?
Oh,

09:55.060 --> 09:56.687
thanks for reminding me.

09:56.730 --> 09:59.221
Kalinda is arranging
a meeting with
Diane Lockhart,

09:59.260 --> 10:01.057
and she asked
me to call her

10:01.100 --> 10:02.249
when the investigation
heats up.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.120
Then give her a call.

10:04.170 --> 10:07.298
Getting a special
prosecutor today.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.399
You're kidding, who?

10:09.440 --> 10:11.908
Me.

10:14.110 --> 10:16.032
I'm Wendy Scott-Carr.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.377
Hello.

10:17.410 --> 10:18.399
Hi.

10:18.450 --> 10:19.917
Peter assigned you?

10:19.950 --> 10:21.042
Yes.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.389
I think he thought
that the person who ran

10:23.420 --> 10:24.910
against him--

10:24.950 --> 10:27.418
and lost-- was a safe bet
to be objective

10:27.460 --> 10:29.109
with a case involving his wife.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.651
Of course, this case
doesn't involve his wife.

10:31.690 --> 10:34.397
Actually, we don't
know that yet.

10:34.430 --> 10:36.728
Let‘s see where the
eVIdence takes us.

10:36.770 --> 10:39.762
(sighs)
Shall we get to work?

10:54.950 --> 10:57.418
MAN: This court-martial is
hereby convened under Article
18

10:57.450 --> 10:58.747
of the Uniform Code

10:58.790 --> 10:59.916
of Military Justice.

10:59.960 --> 11:03.384
Colonel Leora Kuhn, military
judge presiding. All rise!

11:03.430 --> 11:06.081
(quietly): Are there any other
judges in the military?

11:06.130 --> 11:08.052
Sit. Except you.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.923
Mr. Gardner, isn't it?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.164
Yes, Your Honor.

11:12.200 --> 11:13.963
What were you saying?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.228
What was I saying?

11:15.270 --> 11:16.259
Yes.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.165
As I entered court, you saw fit

11:18.210 --> 11:20.132
to say something
to your cocounsel.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.238
Mrs. Florrick.

11:21.280 --> 11:22.975
Judge Kuhn.
What were
you saying,

11:23.010 --> 11:25.103
Mr. Gardner? I would like
to get it on the record.

11:25.150 --> 11:26.469
Apologies, Your Honor.

11:26.510 --> 11:28.910
I was commenting,

11:28.950 --> 11:32.386
"Are there any other judges
in the military?"

11:32.420 --> 11:35.218
Good. To answer
your question,

11:35.260 --> 11:36.454
yes, there are.

11:36.490 --> 11:38.458
And yet, here I am again.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.253
Happy days.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.358
Captain Moyer,

11:41.400 --> 11:42.492
you have
no objection

11:42.530 --> 11:44.498
_ to the accused's
CIVIlian representation?

11:44.530 --> 11:46.737
We don't, Your Honor.
We welcome it.

11:46.770 --> 11:49.432
Although it is a bit crowded
at the defense table.

11:49.470 --> 11:51.028
I imagine you can hold your own.

11:51.070 --> 11:52.799
Are there any motions
before we call the panel?

11:52.840 --> 11:55.001
(quietly):
You take it; she hates me.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.132
Was that_also
something

11:56.180 --> 11:58.808
you wanted to share,
Mr. Gardner?

11:58.850 --> 12:00.374
Yes, Your Honor.

12:00.420 --> 12:03.241
I told Mrs. Florrick,
"You take it; she hates me."

12:05.320 --> 12:07.481
You wound me, sir.

12:08.890 --> 12:11.120
What do you have
for me, ma'am?

12:11.160 --> 12:12.798
We ask_the
court's a55istance

12:12.830 --> 12:15.151
in transporting a witness
for the defense.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.259
A Lieutenant Matt Ventura.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.927
He was the pilot
that was stationed

12:18.970 --> 12:20.289
with our client
at the UAS,

12:20.340 --> 12:22.262
and he has firsthand
knowledge of these events.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.131
Captain Moyer, do you have
any objection to this?

12:24.170 --> 12:25.159
We don't, Your Honor.
In fact,

12:25.210 --> 12:26.507
we've already
transported him

12:26.540 --> 12:28.872
as a witness_
for the prosecution.

12:30.980 --> 12:32.504
Well, that's awkward.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.177
Isn't it?

12:36.080 --> 12:37.911
What's most important is that

12:37.950 --> 12:40.384
we run_an ethical
and clean investigation.

12:40.420 --> 12:42.854
That's the best way to honor the
state's attorney's directive.

12:42.890 --> 12:46.018
Now, I understand you have
evidence of theft and bribery.

12:46.060 --> 12:48.119
Not evidence,
suspicions.

12:48.160 --> 12:49.798
More than suspicions-- the
$45,000 Will Gardner stole.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.889
That was 15 years ago;
the statute

12:51.930 --> 12:52.931
of limitations
has expired.

12:52.970 --> 12:53.937
What about his connection

12:53.970 --> 12:55.267
to Judge Baxter?
Yes.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.392
I think we should
start there.

12:56.440 --> 12:57.862
No.

12:57.910 --> 13:00.902
We don't need that to
get to Lemond Bishop.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.202
Yes, well,
that's what

13:02.240 --> 13:03.571
I most want
to talk about.

13:03.610 --> 13:05.874
I know the plan was
to use Mr. Gardner

13:05.910 --> 13:08.140
as a stepping stone to
his drug-dealing client,

13:08.180 --> 13:09.272
but I believe

13:09.320 --> 13:11.288
we should use
Mr. Gardner

13:11.320 --> 13:14.312
as a stepping stone...
to Mr. Gardner.

13:14.360 --> 13:16.351
I understand you have

13:16.390 --> 13:19.029
a source in
Lockhart/Gardner.
I do.

13:19.060 --> 13:20.027
The investigator,
Kalinda Sharma.

13:20.060 --> 13:21.027
Good.

13:21.060 --> 13:22.197
Cultivate that.

13:22.230 --> 13:23.424
Hang on
a minute.

13:23.470 --> 13:26.325
_ Wasn't the directive of this
investigation to pursue drugs,

13:26.370 --> 13:27.268
Mrs. Scott-Carr?

13:27.300 --> 13:28.392
It was.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.068
And we could be concerned
about Mission Creep here.

13:31.110 --> 13:34.273
But Mr_. Florrick
has given me

13:34.310 --> 13:36.471
the autonomy to
set objectives.

13:36.510 --> 13:38.569
And in looking
at the evidence,

13:38.610 --> 13:41.613
I believe the more
profitable direction

13:41.650 --> 13:45.279
is judicial corruption.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.311
How does that sound?

13:47.360 --> 13:50.181
Good to me.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.857
Me, too.

13:51.890 --> 13:53.494
MOYER:
So, you saw the alert

13:53.530 --> 13:55.623
from the ground commander
warning that there were

13:55.660 --> 13:56.866
civilians_in
the Vicmity.
Yes, sir.

13:56.900 --> 13:59.391
There are sometimes delays in
the transmission of such alerts.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.330
Did you experience
any delays here?

14:01.370 --> 14:03.258
No, there were
no delays, sir.

14:03.310 --> 14:06.108
Then why did the accused
ignore the warning?

14:06.140 --> 14:07.971
Objection, it's
not determined yet

14:08.010 --> 14:11.138
that Staff Sergeant Elkins
ignored anything.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.018
Overruled.

14:18.050 --> 14:20.553
I don't know why Sergeant
Elkins ignored it, sir.

14:20.590 --> 14:22.478
I was stunned when
she fired on the target.

14:22.520 --> 14:24.329
MOYER:
Thank you, Lieutenant.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.351
And thank you for your
service to this country.

14:26.390 --> 14:28.392
Your Honor, we ask for
a five-minute recess.
Denied.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.165
Don't impeach him.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.929
Use him to ask the question.

14:33.970 --> 14:34.959
(clears throat)

14:37.640 --> 14:41.576
Lieutenant, have there
been other civilian deaths

14:41.610 --> 14:43.441
due to drone maneuvers?

14:43.480 --> 14:44.504
Other Afghan deaths?
Yes.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.642
There have.

14:45.680 --> 14:47.272
How many?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.208
Uh, I don't know.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.411
But there have been
civilian deaths.

14:51.450 --> 14:53.452
Not intentional civilian
deaths, accidental.
Yes.

14:53.490 --> 14:56.254
Our drones are accurate, but
we can't control everything

14:56.290 --> 14:57.689
that happens on the
ground in Afghanistan.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.618
In fact, aren't
civilian casualties

14:59.660 --> 15:01.525
SUCh a common occurrence

15:01.560 --> 15:04.393
that they have been
assigned the slang term

15:04.430 --> 15:05.658
"squirters"?

15:05.700 --> 15:07.565
LIEUTENANT:
No, ma'am,
that's incorrect.

15:07.600 --> 15:09.238
ALICIA:
Oh, my apologies.

15:09.270 --> 15:11.409
In the week before the arrest
of Staff Sergeant Elkins,

15:11.440 --> 15:14.409
weren't eight
civilians killed

15:14.440 --> 15:16.476
in a drone attack on
the al-Qaeda operative,

15:16.510 --> 15:18.046
Amad al Dasari?

15:18.080 --> 15:20.173
I believe nine were killed.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.949
Excuse me, nine.

15:21.980 --> 15:25.518
And how many drone operators
were arrested in that attack?

15:25.550 --> 15:26.414
How many?

15:26.450 --> 15:28.315
Yes.

15:29.290 --> 15:31.258
None, to my knowledge.

15:31.290 --> 15:33.224
And how many prosecutions

15:33.260 --> 15:35.990
and arrests have _r_esulted from
any of these CIVIlian deaths?

15:38.400 --> 15:41.062
Even though you're
in a trailer

15:41.100 --> 15:43.204
20 miles north
of Las Vegas,

15:43.240 --> 15:46.505
you do consider yourself part of
the battlefield in Afghanistan?

15:46.540 --> 15:48.076
Yes, of course.

15:48.110 --> 15:50.146
And, like many of
the men and the women

15:50.180 --> 15:52.341
on this jury, you
have been in battle,

15:52.380 --> 15:54.439
even though you don't
have any war wounds

15:54.480 --> 15:56.516
to show for it?
That's correct, ma'am.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.711
So, Staff Sergeant Elkins
was in battle, too,

15:58.750 --> 16:00.980
wasn't she?

16:02.190 --> 16:03.726
Yes.

16:03.760 --> 16:06.024
So this is a prosecution
of a soldier

16:06.060 --> 16:07.527
who accidentally

16:07.560 --> 16:09.152
killed a civilian on the
battlefield, isn't it?

16:09.200 --> 16:10.519
Objection.
Sustained.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.266
That's okay.
I think the
jury understands.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.437
Mrs. Florrick!

16:17.440 --> 16:19.032
ELI:
Yes, that's right,

16:19.070 --> 16:21.709
keep it casual, don't see me

16:21.740 --> 16:23.469
until... hark!

16:23.510 --> 16:26.673
(chuckles)
There you are.

16:26.710 --> 16:29.508
I was rushing over here,
rehearsing my apology.

16:29.550 --> 16:32.041
Can I just say
I am so sorry?

16:32.090 --> 16:33.557
Oh, did you, uh,
order me something?

16:33.590 --> 16:36.411
Just a little
cheese and fruit.

16:36.460 --> 16:38.758
(laughing):
You are such a kick, Eli.

16:38.790 --> 16:41.520
Well, I hope this
means you forgive me.
It does.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.460
I blame myself for
not seeing it coming.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.263
Oh, come on, there
was nothing to see.

16:45.300 --> 16:48.030
I was just offered the Fruit
Association job yesterday.

16:48.070 --> 16:50.709
Smile, Eli, so I
know you're okay.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.237
I'm not gonna let you go.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.599
You're too cute to let go.
No,

16:54.640 --> 16:55.709
you're the cute one.

16:55.740 --> 16:56.809
Did anyone ever tell you,

16:56.840 --> 16:58.102
you have a prerecorded voice?

16:58.150 --> 16:59.299
A what? No, what is that?

16:59.350 --> 17:00.544
One of those credit card

17:00.580 --> 17:02.741
voices that tells you
your call will be answered

17:02.780 --> 17:04.543
in the order received.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.319
(laughs)

17:06.350 --> 17:07.556
I got to borrow that one.

17:07.590 --> 17:09.717
So, on the phone,
you mentioned something

17:09.760 --> 17:11.387
about us working together?

17:11.430 --> 17:12.522
Yes.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.290
The Dairy Guild and
the Fruit Association

17:15.330 --> 17:16.456
are natural allies.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.195
We have a mutual enemy.

17:18.230 --> 17:20.539
Vegetables?
Yes.

17:20.570 --> 17:23.630
You lost real estate.

17:23.670 --> 17:25.331
Vegetables gained real
estate at your expense.

17:25.370 --> 17:27.133
That's what I
keep telling

17:27.180 --> 17:29.398
the fruit growers. Well,
what do you propose?

17:29.440 --> 17:31.749
Combine our lobbying efforts.

17:31.780 --> 17:33.816
(sighs)
I want to say yes, Eli,

17:33.850 --> 17:35.818
but you can't keep
going after the pyramid.

17:35.850 --> 17:38.410
So what should we do?
Well,

17:38.450 --> 17:40.509
without acknowledging
we're a "we" yet,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.209
you should create
a new diagram.

17:42.260 --> 17:43.352
And if we do?

17:43.390 --> 17:44.379
Well, show it to me.

17:44.430 --> 17:47.228
Fruit and cheese are
natural allies here, right?

17:47.260 --> 17:48.693
(chuckles)

17:48.730 --> 17:49.856
DIANE:
She said yes, Eli?

17:49.900 --> 17:52.198
Yes, but she's lying.

17:52.230 --> 17:53.595
She said yes too quickly.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.528
She's either already talking
to the vegetable lobby,

17:55.570 --> 17:56.639
or she'll use our interest

17:56.670 --> 17:57.830
to up their interest.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.667
You got all of this from "yes"?

17:59.710 --> 18:01.132
I need to talk
to the bread people.

18:01.180 --> 18:03.102
Eli, our clients
don't want to go there.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.505
I'll talk to them; it's
the only way to beat this lady.

18:05.550 --> 18:07.768
We are not trying to beat this
lady, Eli; we're just trying

18:07.820 --> 18:09.572
to do well by our client.

18:09.620 --> 18:11.144
I got to go.

18:11.190 --> 18:14.512
(beep)

18:14.560 --> 18:16.653
MAN:
Andrew R. Galecki.

18:16.690 --> 18:19.181
I work at Langley as
a military analyst.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.720
MOYER:
And you were part of
the sensor-to-shooter

18:20.760 --> 18:21.897
decision chain on
the drone maneuver?

18:21.930 --> 18:23.659
Yes, the kill chain.

18:23.700 --> 18:26.794
Now, the defense has argued
that there are many deaths

18:26.830 --> 18:29.697
in UAS maneuvers, and
this is just one more.

18:29.740 --> 18:30.832
Is that true?

18:30.870 --> 18:32.599
There is, in fact collateral
damage in drone maneuvers,

18:32.640 --> 18:34.369
but most of these deaths
are taken into account

18:34.410 --> 18:35.672
in the kill chain algorithm.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.701
MOYER:
You'll have to
explain that, sir.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.913
We take into_ account
the strategic value

18:40.950 --> 18:42.508
of eliminating
a target,

18:42.550 --> 18:44.643
the potential damage
to civilians,

18:44.690 --> 18:47.386
and the proximity to mosques,
schools, or hospitals.

18:47.420 --> 18:48.751
This is all entered into
a computer algorithm,

18:48.790 --> 18:51.657
which determines the
worthiness of an attack.
So there are some deaths

18:51.690 --> 18:53.726
of civilians that are
deemed appropriate.

18:53.760 --> 18:55.398
Unfortunately, yes,
sometimes the value

18:55.430 --> 18:57.591
of killing an al-Qaeda
target outweighs

18:57.630 --> 18:59.188
killing civilians.
That was the case

18:59.230 --> 19:01.698
with the al-Qaeda
operative, Amad al Dasari?

19:01.740 --> 19:03.401
The defense has argued
that someone

19:03.440 --> 19:04.839
should have been arrested
in that attack

19:04.870 --> 19:06.337
because civilians were killed.

19:06.370 --> 19:08.770
No, that attack
was sanctioned.

19:08.810 --> 19:10.038
We were willing
to risk more deaths

19:10.080 --> 19:12.640
because Mr. A! Dasari was such
a danger to the United States.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.443
And the drone attack,

19:14.480 --> 19:15.572
initiated by the accused?

19:15.620 --> 19:16.575
That was not a
sanctioned attack.

19:16.620 --> 19:19.509
We sent out an immediate
transmi55ion when we saw

19:19.550 --> 19:20.551
children in the area.

19:20.590 --> 19:24.185
The accused took it upon
herself to fire anyway.

19:24.230 --> 19:26.619
How many women are on the jury?

19:26.660 --> 19:28.457
Six.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.649
We should argue
she's being prosecuted

19:29.700 --> 19:30.792
because she's a woman.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.889
It's not true, and
even if it were,

19:32.930 --> 19:34.591
it doesn't matter.
Why isn't it true?

19:34.640 --> 19:36.335
The pilot isn't
being prosecuted,

19:36.370 --> 19:37.632
none of her
commanders, all men.

19:37.670 --> 19:38.739
Do we know that?

19:38.770 --> 19:39.907
Check the transcripts.

19:39.940 --> 19:41.601
I thought it was
all male names.

19:41.640 --> 19:42.777
It won't work.

19:42.810 --> 19:44.402
The panel will
consider it whining.

19:44.450 --> 19:45.769
What defense

19:45.810 --> 19:47.675
would they consider not whining?
What'd you find?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.382
Um, nothing.

19:50.420 --> 19:53.617
(clears throat)
Would you excuse me
for a moment?

20:14.380 --> 20:15.631
It's not gonna work.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.874
What's not gonna work?

20:16.910 --> 20:18.639
Seducing me.

20:18.680 --> 20:19.772
I don't want
to seduce you.

20:19.810 --> 20:21.016
You don't?
No.

20:21.050 --> 20:22.415
Too easy.

20:22.450 --> 20:24.714
Hey. I mean,

20:24.750 --> 20:26.308
what's the point anyway?
I don't get it.

20:26.350 --> 20:27.419
Without a penis involved?

20:27.460 --> 20:30.020
That's like baseball
without a bat.

20:30.060 --> 20:32.528
Well, you get it
when you get it.

20:32.560 --> 20:33.595
Oh...

20:33.630 --> 20:34.892
Deep.

20:34.930 --> 20:36.397
It's different.

20:36.430 --> 20:40.662
A woman's lips, and when
you get a woman excited...

20:40.700 --> 20:43.806
It's not like a man.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.967
I hope not.

20:46.010 --> 20:48.001
It's not aggressive.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.837
It's slow.

20:49.880 --> 20:51.802
Suspenseful.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.016
You want to hurt Cary?

20:56.050 --> 20:57.483
No.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.579
Yeah, you do.

20:59.620 --> 21:01.611
That's okay, he wants
to hurt you, too.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.685
Really? And how does
he want to do that?

21:03.730 --> 21:04.549
Through me.

21:04.590 --> 21:06.626
How's he gonna do
that through you?

21:06.660 --> 21:09.299
There's a special prosecutor.

21:09.330 --> 21:10.763
Wendy Scott-Carr.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.620
Yep.

21:12.670 --> 21:14.865
And we're not going
after Lemond Bishop.

21:14.900 --> 21:16.834
We are going after
Will Gardner.

21:16.870 --> 21:17.768
On what?

21:17.810 --> 21:20.699
Bribery, banging judges.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.605
Did I say banging?

21:22.640 --> 21:23.846
You did.

21:23.880 --> 21:26.747
I meant bribing.

21:26.780 --> 21:28.919
I need to get a cab.

21:28.950 --> 21:29.917
Here's my money.

21:29.950 --> 21:30.917
I got it.

21:30.950 --> 21:33.089
No, no, no,
I got it, I got it.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.008
You all right?

21:35.060 --> 21:36.880
(sighs)

21:36.920 --> 21:38.922
(Dana panting)

21:41.660 --> 21:43.890
I said it would take
more than just a few shots

21:43.930 --> 21:46.069
to get me into bed.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.091
Then what?

21:48.140 --> 21:51.803
I asked her what it was like
to make love to a woman.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.831
You want to know what she said?

21:53.880 --> 21:57.441
When we get excited,
you can feel it.

21:58.980 --> 22:01.847
Did she want
to touch you?

22:01.880 --> 22:04.348
Uh-huh.

22:04.390 --> 22:06.642
She wanted me like this.

22:21.970 --> 22:24.609
Thank you.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.870
ZACH:
So what were you
were looking for?

22:28.910 --> 22:30.775
Just seeing if someone was
looking through my files.

22:30.810 --> 22:32.698
ZACH:
Well, your history's right here,

22:32.750 --> 22:34.149
which should show you
which files were opened.

22:34.180 --> 22:35.579
How far back?
ALICIA:
Saturday.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.781
ZACH:
Nope. Nothing on Saturday.

22:39.820 --> 22:42.550
Your webcam was on,
but that's about it.

22:42.590 --> 22:43.921
What's up?

22:45.130 --> 22:48.122
What'd she do?

22:48.160 --> 22:50.424
Nothing. I just want to
create stronger boundaries.

22:50.470 --> 22:53.598
I think your grandmother misses
being involved in our lives,

22:53.640 --> 22:55.392
and... I want to talk
to her about that.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.634
Well, Dad sends her
to pick us up.

22:56.670 --> 22:58.069
I know. And I'll
talk to your dad,

22:58.110 --> 22:59.964
but I don't know if
I can change that.

23:00.010 --> 23:02.001
So you just want us to keep
her out of the apartment?
She went through

23:02.040 --> 23:03.905
your laptop,
didn't she?
What?

23:03.950 --> 23:04.974
Grandma went through
Mom's laptop.

23:05.010 --> 23:06.739
I don't know that.
I don't know.

23:06.780 --> 23:09.419
Your dad and I are being very
good with each other these days,

23:09.450 --> 23:11.816
and I just don't want Jackie
getting in the way of that.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.989
What was she looking for?
I don't even know that she was.

23:14.020 --> 23:16.682
Here. Take these keys,
and let me know

23:16.720 --> 23:17.982
if there are any problems.

23:18.030 --> 23:19.986
Mom, what does she want?

23:21.800 --> 23:24.826
I think your grandmother...

23:24.870 --> 23:25.962
wants sole custody for your dad.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.763
What?

23:27.800 --> 23:28.698
Mom, we're not six.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.061
I know. She wishes you were.
Is she looking

23:31.110 --> 23:32.065
for things
you did wrong?

23:32.110 --> 23:33.839
I don't know, okay?

23:33.880 --> 23:36.701
I just... I want to be safe,
that's all.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.571
Is there anything on there?

23:40.580 --> 23:41.911
No.

23:45.890 --> 23:48.017
Mom, are you all right?

23:48.060 --> 23:50.051
Iam, I...

23:52.160 --> 23:54.424
I just have to get
this figured out, that's all.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.197
We have to watch Grandma.

23:57.230 --> 23:59.869
I know.

23:59.900 --> 24:02.130
She's such a bitch.

24:02.170 --> 24:05.207
PRERECORDED FEMALE VOICE:
Your call is very important
to us. Please stay on the line

24:05.240 --> 24:06.969
and your call will be
answered in the order...

24:07.010 --> 24:08.204
It's her.
It's her voice.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.435
Bread, Eli.

24:11.650 --> 24:12.901
Our interests are identical.

24:12.950 --> 24:13.974
Bread.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.045
Dairy. You have suffered

24:16.080 --> 24:17.843
the most from
the MyPlate design.

24:17.890 --> 24:20.518
Bread used to hold the prominent
spot on the pyramid.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.515
Now it is classified

24:21.560 --> 24:23.721
as grains.
So what do we do?

24:23.760 --> 24:24.852
Combine our lobbying interests.

24:24.890 --> 24:25.959
It's not going to help.
It's all about

24:25.990 --> 24:27.491
vegetables these days.

24:27.530 --> 24:29.122
ELI:
What food holds the most
sway over Congress?

24:29.160 --> 24:31.663
What food receives
$3.5 billion a year

24:31.700 --> 24:33.099
in food subsidies?

24:33.130 --> 24:35.564
Corn?
That's right.

24:35.600 --> 24:38.706
Corn has always been
classified as a vegetable,

24:38.740 --> 24:42.176
but it's just as much a grain.

24:43.980 --> 24:45.777
How are you, Gina?

24:45.810 --> 24:47.914
I'm good, ma'am.

24:47.950 --> 24:49.941
Are you in touch
with your parents?

24:51.290 --> 24:52.780
Iam.

24:52.820 --> 24:53.912
Are they coming?

24:53.960 --> 24:55.951
No.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.099
Is there anything
I can do for you?

25:01.130 --> 25:03.598
Anything at all?

25:05.630 --> 25:07.632
No.

25:08.970 --> 25:10.631
Thank you.

25:10.670 --> 25:12.934
You're welcome.

25:12.970 --> 25:15.734
COURT GUARD:
All rise!

25:15.780 --> 25:16.929
WOMAN:
Staff Sergeant Nora Swan,

25:16.980 --> 25:18.971
Aircraft Structural Maintenance.
MOYER:
And the accused was

25:19.010 --> 25:20.614
your bunkmate at
Addis Air Force Base?

25:20.650 --> 25:22.140
Yes, sir.
MOYER:
And what did you observe

25:22.180 --> 25:24.045
your bunkmate doing
on the morning in question?

25:24.090 --> 25:25.819
Ingesting Adriphan.

25:25.850 --> 25:28.648
MOYER:
_This is a
prescription stimulant

25:28.690 --> 25:29.952
used to combat shift-work
sleep disorder?

25:29.990 --> 25:31.127
Yes, sir.

25:31.160 --> 25:33.128
It keeps you awake?
Yes, sir.

25:33.160 --> 25:35.958
But it can also overstimulate,
cause someone to overreact...

25:36.000 --> 25:37.251
Objection.
Beyond the expertise.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.961
I'll rephrase.

25:39.000 --> 25:41.935
Have you ever been warned about
the side effects of Adriphan?

25:41.970 --> 25:43.835
Yes, sir.

25:43.870 --> 25:45.303
It can make you jumpy.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.137
React too quickly to stimuli.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.775
Thank you, Sergeant.

25:51.010 --> 25:54.138
Sergeant, where did Staff
Sergeant Elkins get these pills?

25:56.350 --> 25:58.113
They were... mine.

25:58.150 --> 26:00.118
So you have
a prescription for them?

26:01.090 --> 26:03.183
No.
But you were taking them--

26:03.220 --> 26:05.154
these pills that tend
to overstimulate?

26:05.190 --> 26:06.680
I was.
Why?

26:06.730 --> 26:08.129
Well...

26:08.160 --> 26:10.321
We're in double-shifts on
some days on maintenance.

26:10.360 --> 26:12.965
You know, it's-it's the
only way to stay awake.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.332
And you were fine with the risk
of beingoverstimulated?

26:15.370 --> 26:16.997
Objection.
I'll rephrase.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.338
You testified
that you did not

26:19.370 --> 26:21.076
have a prescription
for these pills,

26:21.110 --> 26:23.032
so where did
you get them?
Where?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.605
Yes, if you didn't get them
from a medical specialist,

26:25.650 --> 26:27.379
you must have gotten
them from somewhere.

26:27.410 --> 26:30.345
I...

26:30.380 --> 26:32.189
I-I'd rather not say.

26:32.220 --> 26:33.881
Yes, and I'd rather not ask.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.353
From someone in
the unit, ma'am.

26:35.390 --> 26:37.085
ALICIA:
Do other people in the unit
take these pills?

26:37.120 --> 26:38.781
SWAN :
Yes.

26:38.830 --> 26:40.650
In fact, isn't it an open
secret that Adriphan

26:40.700 --> 26:43.191
is taken by almost everyone,
from fighter pilots to...?

26:43.230 --> 26:44.390
Objection, Your Honor.
Calls for speculation.

26:44.430 --> 26:47.024
Actually, I don't think it calls
for much speculation at all.

26:47.070 --> 26:48.094
Mrs. Florrick!

26:48.140 --> 26:49.789
My apologies, Your Honor.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.159
No further questions.

26:59.780 --> 27:02.374
My parents always wanted me
to take the corporate path.

27:02.420 --> 27:05.082
But you were the rebel?

27:05.120 --> 27:09.079
I tried being
a defense attorney, but...

27:09.120 --> 27:12.886
I realized I didn't like
guilty people.

27:12.930 --> 27:14.227
Not that you do.

27:14.260 --> 27:16.228
Oh, no, I do.
I love them.

27:16.260 --> 27:17.192
That's why I work here.

27:17.230 --> 27:19.289
DANA:
This isn't going
to go well, is it?

27:19.330 --> 27:21.093
Nope.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.768
This is where I sat when
I was waiting to be fired.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.960
Really?
Yeah.

27:30.210 --> 27:31.700
WENDY:
Do you have children, Diane?

27:31.750 --> 27:34.344
I don't.
Well,

27:34.380 --> 27:37.019
I found the best way
to raise mine was to

27:37.050 --> 27:39.416
tell them exactly what
is expected of them,

27:39.450 --> 27:42.089
how they misbehaved,
and what they have to do

27:42.120 --> 27:43.314
to get back in my good graces.

27:43.360 --> 27:45.123
I didn't even know
you had graces,

27:45.160 --> 27:47.185
and suddenly I seem
to be out of them.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.424
(laughs)

27:48.460 --> 27:51.190
No. I'm speaking
of your partner.

27:51.230 --> 27:53.323
Ah, Will. Well, actually,
he's in court right now.

27:53.370 --> 27:55.235
But why don't I tell
him you dropped by?

27:57.170 --> 27:59.104
Diane, I am leading
an investigation

27:59.140 --> 28:00.971
into judicial bribery.

28:01.010 --> 28:02.170
There are three
judges on the bench

28:02.210 --> 28:04.849
who are receiving payments
in trade for their decisions.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.973
Really?

28:07.010 --> 28:08.216
VVho?

28:08.250 --> 28:12.949
We believe the nexus of that
bribery scheme is Will Gardner.

28:12.990 --> 28:15.117
(chuckles)

28:15.160 --> 28:18.357
It's always nice to know how
my tax dollars are being spent.

28:18.390 --> 28:20.187
Mr. Gardner has a Wednesday
night pick-up game

28:20.230 --> 28:22.118
involving lawyers and judges.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.993
At these games, he's
introduced judges to bookies

28:25.030 --> 28:26.497
for the purposes
of illegal betting.

28:26.530 --> 28:29.988
The judges quickly get
sucked into bigger bets,

28:30.040 --> 28:33.134
at which time the bookies
forgive the debt

28:33.170 --> 28:34.876
_ in trade for
friendly sentences.

28:34.910 --> 28:37.470
One thing I've noticed about
prosecutors, Ms. Scott-Carr:

28:37.510 --> 28:40.001
they tend to treat
accusations as facts.

28:40.050 --> 28:42.075
We know your hands
are clean, Diane.

28:42.120 --> 28:45.044
How do we know that?

28:45.090 --> 28:48.309
You're right.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.158
We don't know
your hands are clean.

28:51.190 --> 28:56.150
You can demonstrate your hands
are clean by talking with us.

28:57.900 --> 29:00.164
Well, look at this,
my two favorite people.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.895
Cary.
Kalinda.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.430
Did you get home all right?

29:03.470 --> 29:06.064
I did. Thank you.
Whew, hangover.

29:06.110 --> 29:07.429
Nice jacket.

29:07.470 --> 29:10.200
Thanks. I think
it's the same label.

29:13.350 --> 29:15.341
Thank you for the time.
No problem.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.221
Where's Will?
He's parking.

29:34.570 --> 29:36.765
Do you have a minute?

29:41.010 --> 29:43.899
DIANE: _
You're being investigated.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.303
I know.
It's winding down.

29:45.350 --> 29:47.079
It's not winding down.

29:47.110 --> 29:49.578
Peter Florrick just
assigned Wendy Scott-Carr

29:51.090 --> 29:52.887
How do you know?
She was just in my office,

29:52.920 --> 29:54.148
trying to turn me against you.

29:56.590 --> 29:59.150
It's about Lemond Bishop.
They're trying to use me...

29:59.190 --> 30:01.897
No, it's not.
We need to get out of the
Lemond Bishop business...

30:01.930 --> 30:03.090
Will, it's not.
They're coming after you.

30:03.130 --> 30:03.994
They say that
just to scare you.

30:04.030 --> 30:06.225
They say that because
they have something.

30:06.270 --> 30:08.591
Judicial bribery.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.835
What?

30:11.610 --> 30:14.579
Your Wednesday night
basketball games.

30:14.610 --> 30:17.101
She thinks you're
introducing judges to bookies.

30:17.140 --> 30:18.573
What?

30:18.610 --> 30:20.874
The judges bet on games,
they can't pay;

30:20.920 --> 30:24.242
the bookies relieve the debt
in trade for a lesser sentence.

30:24.290 --> 30:28.579
I don't want you to
say anything to me...

30:28.620 --> 30:31.259
but I want you to
take care of this.

30:31.290 --> 30:33.258
I will not let
this firm go under

30:33.290 --> 30:35.850
because of some S.A.
fishing expedition...

30:35.900 --> 30:37.253
Diane, it's not true...
Of course it's not true.

30:37.300 --> 30:39.268
That's not the point.

30:39.300 --> 30:41.165
Make it go away.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.906
Stop it.

30:47.940 --> 30:49.271
Stop. . .?
Alicia.

30:52.380 --> 30:54.348
_ Peter Florrick
is coming after you

30:54.380 --> 30:56.940
because you are sleeping
with his wife.

30:56.980 --> 30:59.448
Don't lie to me.

30:59.490 --> 31:00.582
It's wrong.

31:00.620 --> 31:03.157
You are her boss.

31:03.190 --> 31:05.283
He is the state's attorney.

31:05.330 --> 31:08.857
Even if it weren't wrong,
it's not smart.

31:11.430 --> 31:13.421
Stop sleeping with his wife.

31:14.670 --> 31:16.865
Do you understand me?

31:25.150 --> 31:26.947
(loud clang)

31:29.680 --> 31:33.684
You, gentlemen, are a grain,
you are not a vegetable.

31:33.720 --> 31:34.755
In fact, other
vegetables gain more

31:34.790 --> 31:37.588
by being associated with you
than you with them.

31:37.620 --> 31:40.589
That is why you were left
with MyPlate.

31:40.630 --> 31:42.518
Where is com?

31:42.560 --> 31:45.620
It is subsumed in "Vegetables."

31:45.670 --> 31:48.537
But we aim to change all that.

31:48.570 --> 31:50.538
With this.

31:50.570 --> 31:52.060
A full-body food chart.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.533
With sections for
fruits, dairy, breads.

31:54.580 --> 31:56.138
And here...

31:56.180 --> 31:58.045
Corn is at the heart.

31:58.080 --> 31:59.547
A place of prominence.

31:59.580 --> 32:02.276
To reflect its importance
in the American diet.

32:02.320 --> 32:06.609
It is to all our benefit to
rethink the current food chart.

32:06.650 --> 32:08.481
And we need your help
to encourage Congress to...

32:08.520 --> 32:09.657
(laughing)

32:09.690 --> 32:12.056
Chin up.

32:12.090 --> 32:13.648
(laughing)

32:13.690 --> 32:15.726
Um...

32:15.760 --> 32:17.091
(laughing)

32:17.130 --> 32:18.995
Eli. Hi, how are you?

32:19.030 --> 32:21.430
I'm good.
So you're here...?

32:21.470 --> 32:22.698
Oh, just to chat
with a few friends.

32:22.740 --> 32:24.230
Really? How nice.
Arthur, hi.

32:24.270 --> 32:26.101
So you're trying to
pull corn on board?

32:26.140 --> 32:27.732
On board?
With you.

32:27.770 --> 32:29.977
Well, it's produce, isn't it?

32:30.010 --> 32:31.568
I thought we had a deal.
Really?

32:31.610 --> 32:32.599
Cheese and fruit?

32:32.650 --> 32:34.470
That was our agreement.

32:34.520 --> 32:38.445
When you're dead, Eli, you know
what the polite thing is to do?

32:39.790 --> 32:41.985
Get a shovel.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.771
We think
you should take Ventura.

33:04.810 --> 33:06.402
Why?

33:06.450 --> 33:08.111
The sexism angle
will come better from you.

33:08.150 --> 33:09.447
We're worried
it'll seem

33:09.480 --> 33:11.687
like outsiders meddling
if we go tough on him.

33:12.720 --> 33:13.641
Understood.

33:13.690 --> 33:15.214
MAN:
All rise!

33:17.720 --> 33:19.756
HICKS:
Uh, thank you for returning,
Lieutenant Ventura.

33:19.790 --> 33:22.759
Um, you have testified
that, uh,

33:22.800 --> 33:25.121
there was no delay
in the stand-down transmission

33:25.170 --> 33:27.024
from the kill chain
and that, therefore,

33:27.070 --> 33:28.697
uh, Staff Sergeant Elkins
overreacted.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.059
Yes, sir.

33:31.110 --> 33:32.702
Good. Okay.

33:32.740 --> 33:35.436
So, uh...

33:35.480 --> 33:37.607
Okay. Um...

33:37.640 --> 33:39.801
Uh, so, um...

33:41.720 --> 33:43.210
Have there been?

33:43.250 --> 33:44.615
Yes, but there
wasn't one here.

33:44.650 --> 33:47.141
Sergeant Elkins
ignored the order.

33:47.190 --> 33:48.817
I see.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.579
And is that why you started
an online petition in the spring

33:51.630 --> 33:52.722
opposing the integration
of females

33:52.760 --> 33:54.057
into the submarine force?

33:54.100 --> 33:55.795
Because females
can't take orders?

33:55.830 --> 33:57.718
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.160
I... Sustained.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.531
Lieutenant Ventura,

34:02.570 --> 34:04.333
have you worked
with other female airmen

34:04.370 --> 34:06.133
in the UAV complex?
Yes, definitely.

34:06.170 --> 34:07.808
And you have no issues
working with female NCOs?

34:07.840 --> 34:10.206
No, of course not.

34:10.240 --> 34:11.502
Why?

34:12.780 --> 34:14.748
Because I'm asking you
a question.

34:14.780 --> 34:16.077
Lieutenant Ventura,

34:16.120 --> 34:17.576
who is Staff
Sergeant Montoya?

34:19.120 --> 34:21.714
Sergeant Montoya worked
as a sensor operator

34:21.760 --> 34:22.852
in the UAV last year.

34:22.890 --> 34:24.551
She has since been removed.

34:24.590 --> 34:26.421
And she was removed because you
complained about her?

34:26.460 --> 34:28.428
No, sir. She was being
disruptive during our shifts.

34:28.460 --> 34:30.690
So you had her replaced?
No, I told my commanding
officer, and he replaced her.

34:30.730 --> 34:32.459
Understood.

34:32.500 --> 34:35.537
And how many other NCOs have you
worked beside without incident?

34:35.570 --> 34:37.868
Doze_ns. This was
my first inCIdent.

34:37.900 --> 34:38.605
A female?

34:38.640 --> 34:41.803
Yes, but that's
incidental.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.376
So it's incidental
that out of the dozens

34:43.410 --> 34:44.570
of NCOs you've worked with
over the years,

34:44.610 --> 34:47.738
you've had complaints
only about two females?
Yes, sir.

34:47.780 --> 34:49.338
Who works with you now?

34:49.380 --> 34:50.779
I don't understand
the question.

34:50.820 --> 34:53.141
Now that you've had Staff
Sergeant Elkins replaced...

34:53.190 --> 34:54.589
MOYER:
Objection.
Sustained.

34:56.390 --> 34:57.857
Now that you're working
with someone

34:57.890 --> 34:59.653
other than
Staff Sergeant Elkins,

34:59.690 --> 35:00.827
are there
any complaints?

35:00.860 --> 35:02.498
No. I work well with people.

35:02.530 --> 35:06.227
Is Staff Sergeant Elkins'
replacement a male or a female?

35:08.170 --> 35:09.637
A male.

35:09.670 --> 35:11.558
Understood.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.499
Thank you for
your honesty.

35:17.780 --> 35:19.179
Hello, Jackie.

35:19.210 --> 35:20.302
Alicia.

35:20.350 --> 35:22.477
H was, uh...

35:22.520 --> 35:24.249
My key seems to be sticking.

35:24.290 --> 35:25.780
I know.

35:27.550 --> 35:28.915
You changed the locks?

35:28.960 --> 35:30.313
I did.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.658
Would you like to explain why?

35:32.690 --> 35:34.157
Sure. I don't want you
in here anymore.

35:35.930 --> 35:38.319
You don't want me
picking up Zach and Grace?

35:38.370 --> 35:39.667
I don't.

35:39.700 --> 35:41.895
But I can't control
what Peter needs from you.

35:41.940 --> 35:42.929
What you need
from me, too, Alicia.

35:42.970 --> 35:44.164
But I can
control my home.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.303
I don't want you
in here, Jackie.

35:46.340 --> 35:48.376
I don't want you going
through my things.

35:48.410 --> 35:50.275
I don't want you in my computer.

35:52.750 --> 35:53.671
You're hurting your children.

35:53.710 --> 35:57.874
I might be, but that's
between me and them,

35:57.920 --> 36:00.946
and I would never
take your word for it.

36:00.990 --> 36:02.480
They're not safe with you.

36:02.520 --> 36:04.454
(chuckling)

36:04.490 --> 36:06.856
Go ahead, Jackie--
reach into that bag of tricks.

36:06.890 --> 36:08.619
What do you have
that could hurt me?

36:10.430 --> 36:12.193
Zach is dating
Eli Gold's daughter.

36:12.230 --> 36:14.232
Oh, my gosh.
That's terrible.

36:14.270 --> 36:16.397
They were in
your bedroom.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.534
(sighs)
Should I get a chair for this?

36:19.570 --> 36:21.674
Grace goes into her bedroom with
her tutor and locks the door.

36:21.710 --> 36:23.871
Well, it would help if you got
your facts straight, Jackie.

36:23.910 --> 36:25.639
There is no lock
on Grace's door.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.272
She pushes the chair against it.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.813
Look at me, Jackie.

36:29.850 --> 36:32.842
Look at my face.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.188
You no longer have
the power to wound.

36:37.860 --> 36:39.555
They're your children.

36:39.590 --> 36:41.956
You need to be
their mother.

36:42.000 --> 36:43.319
Good night, Jackie.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.845
Zach?

36:59.880 --> 37:01.643
Hey, Mom.
What's up?

37:01.680 --> 37:03.841
Jackie drives you
over to Dad's now?

37:03.880 --> 37:06.019
Yeah. Why?

37:06.050 --> 37:08.587
Get your coat.
Let's buy you a car.

37:10.890 --> 37:12.482
(chuckles)

37:18.900 --> 37:20.993
No, I understand.
I'll just keep in touch.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.258
Thank you.

37:22.300 --> 37:24.564
That didn't sound good.

37:24.610 --> 37:27.261
We're out of the
cheese busmess.

37:27.310 --> 37:28.732
The dairy people
want a change of
direction.

37:28.780 --> 37:30.372
They're going with Stacie Hall.

37:30.410 --> 37:32.275
I explained she made no sense

37:32.310 --> 37:33.447
since she represents
fruit, too.

37:33.480 --> 37:34.572
But they thought
a nonsensical plan

37:34.620 --> 37:37.441
made more sense than I did.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.038
I need something to drink.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.409
Well, don't get morose.

37:40.450 --> 37:41.678
Why not?

37:41.720 --> 37:43.415
It deserves a little _
wallowmg, don't you think?

37:43.460 --> 37:45.382
Four or five million
a year between us.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.829
Nora, why don't
I have Scotch?!

37:46.860 --> 37:47.827
Win them back.

37:47.860 --> 37:50.420
Oh, yes, you're right.

37:50.460 --> 37:51.529
What was I thinking?

37:51.570 --> 37:53.367
Do men really have that much
success in their life

37:53.400 --> 37:54.196
that the first setback

37:54.230 --> 37:56.391
that comes along,
they get all weepy?

37:56.440 --> 37:57.691
I'm not weepy.

37:57.740 --> 38:00.402
I'm...

38:00.440 --> 38:04.479
I'm tired.

38:04.510 --> 38:05.875
It's hard doing this.

38:05.910 --> 38:06.979
I don't sleep at night.

38:07.010 --> 38:09.615
I stare at the clock, I think
about nothing else.

38:09.650 --> 38:10.742
And it's not productive time.

38:10.780 --> 38:12.941
It's stare-at-the-clock time.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.355
You can always give up.

38:16.390 --> 38:19.359
Can Ijust have a minute
to feel bad for myself?

38:19.390 --> 38:20.379
Yes, I'm sorry.

38:21.900 --> 38:25.893
I don't like losing.

38:25.930 --> 38:30.629
I'm always looking for when
things start to turn south.

38:30.670 --> 38:32.604
What if it's now?

38:37.510 --> 38:40.104
Eli, we're gonna wallow

38:40.150 --> 38:42.618
for a few hours now.

38:42.650 --> 38:44.982
We'll drink.

38:45.020 --> 38:46.988
I'll put you in a cab.

38:47.020 --> 38:49.113
You will sleep it off.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.116
You won't feel good
in the morning.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.129
You will come in late,
but you will come in.

38:54.160 --> 38:57.721
We'll sit, we'll talk.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.921
You've been lording it
over us up until now.

38:59.970 --> 39:00.925
I have not.

39:00.970 --> 39:03.530
Yes, you have. Don't argue.

39:03.570 --> 39:06.664
You are brilliant, but
you're not God's gift.

39:06.710 --> 39:08.575
We'll sit and talk.

39:08.610 --> 39:09.872
We'll hatch a plan.

39:09.910 --> 39:14.142
And Stacie Hall is
going to rue the day.

39:14.180 --> 39:15.545
And that's a fact.

39:17.980 --> 39:19.686
But for the moment...

39:22.060 --> 39:25.450
KUHN:
Members of the panel,
have youreached a verdict?

39:28.600 --> 39:31.057
Staff Sergeant Regina Elkins,
please stand.

39:36.540 --> 39:40.101
"In the matter
of The United States v.

39:40.140 --> 39:42.028
"Staff Sergeant
Regina E. Elkins,

39:42.080 --> 39:45.709
"on the charge of murder under
Section 118 of the Uniform Code

39:45.750 --> 39:47.502
"of Military Justice, count one,

39:47.550 --> 39:50.439
"we the panel find
the accused guilty.

39:50.480 --> 39:52.539
"On the charge of murder
under Section 118

39:52.590 --> 39:56.014
"of the Uniform Code,
count two,

39:56.060 --> 40:00.156
"we the panel find
the accused guilty.

40:00.190 --> 40:03.091
"On the charge of murder under
Section 118 of the Uniform Code,

40:03.130 --> 40:06.497
"count three, we the panel
find the accused guilty.

40:06.530 --> 40:09.567
"On the charge of murder
under Section 118

40:09.600 --> 40:11.534
"of the Uniform Code,
count four,

40:11.570 --> 40:14.573
we the panel
find the accused guilty."

40:14.610 --> 40:16.032
(approaching footsteps)

40:23.620 --> 40:24.882
You thought
it was unjust?

40:33.530 --> 40:34.519
Yes.

40:34.560 --> 40:35.652
Why?

40:35.700 --> 40:37.122
She was scapegoated.

40:37.160 --> 40:39.060
She's being sent to prison

40:39.100 --> 40:40.761
because she was used
as a scapegoat

40:40.800 --> 40:43.462
for an inaccurate
drone program.

40:43.500 --> 40:44.706
No. She was convicted

40:44.740 --> 40:46.560
because she did wrong.
She was a woman,

40:46.610 --> 40:47.929
that was her only...
Oh, please.

40:47.970 --> 40:49.676
Do you know
what that defense says

40:49.710 --> 40:51.575
about the thousands
of women who serve honorably?

40:51.610 --> 40:52.872
We don't want that defense.

40:52.910 --> 40:55.572
This isn't about want.
This is about truth.

40:55.620 --> 40:59.647
And the truth is
there are 12 people dead

40:59.690 --> 41:03.683
because of Sergeant Elkins'
actions.

41:03.720 --> 41:06.223
She went to work
incapacitated by drugs

41:06.260 --> 41:10.128
and she killed 12 people.
Six children.

41:10.160 --> 41:13.664
You didn't ask one
word about them.

41:13.700 --> 41:16.089
They are dead.

41:16.140 --> 41:17.232
They burned to death.

41:17.270 --> 41:18.908
Children like yours.

41:18.940 --> 41:22.171
Children like mine.

41:23.640 --> 41:26.006
Th_eir mothers
are mourning them right now.

41:26.050 --> 41:28.678
She may be
pushing buttons,

41:28.720 --> 41:29.744
but they are dead.

41:29.780 --> 41:32.613
And they did nothing wrong.

41:32.650 --> 41:34.140
This was a just verdict.

41:34.190 --> 41:35.714
It was.

41:35.760 --> 41:38.251
And she will serve
time for that.

41:38.290 --> 41:39.882
The problem with the charge
of scapegoating is

41:39.930 --> 41:41.659
that it doesn't acknowledge
at a certain point

41:41.700 --> 41:43.053
you have to hold people
accountable.

41:43.100 --> 41:46.558
That is what's happening here.

41:46.600 --> 41:47.828
That's all.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.239
I have to go now.

41:53.210 --> 41:55.678
Good night, Mrs. Florrick.
