5 days of sun, beach--

08:34.480 --> 08:36.778
It's just a short trip for you.

to gettin' back home--

08:41.120 --> 08:43.145
- back to Michigan.
- [Woman] I'm sorry.

[Man, Faintly] Hello! Welcome.
Thank you for joining us.

Our goal is to have the most
energy-efficient resort...

10:56.756 --> 10:58.724
in this part of the word.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.452
As you know, this island rests
in close proximity...

11:01.560 --> 11:03.528
to the volcanic corridor.

11:03.629 --> 11:05.620
Oh, yeah. Everyone knows that, huh?

11:05.731 --> 11:07.790
[Cynthia]
So we've constructed our own geothermal plant...

11:07.900 --> 11:10.061
allowing us to use heat for power.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.296

I mean, I know you see exotic spots
like this all the time...

11:43.869 --> 11:46.804
but this is pretty decent
for us civilian folk.

11:49.275 --> 11:51.266
Sierra, you copy?

11:52.945 --> 11:54.970
Affirmative.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.507
Hmm.

12:01.854 --> 12:05.415
You know, I haven't seen you like this since--

12:05.524 --> 12:07.515
Well, since ever.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.623
Last one was bad, huh?

12:12.865 --> 12:14.856
Yeah. It just went a little sideways.

12:14.967 --> 12:17.401
Anything you could have done?

12:17.503 --> 12:21.405
I don't know.
I just got a closer look than I usually get.

12:21.507 --> 12:23.532
[Robin]
You wanna talk about it?

12:26.812 --> 12:29.610

12:29.715 --> 12:31.683
Well--

12:33.519 --> 12:36.488

there was some good reason I married you.

12:48.067 --> 12:52.299
- You have very low expectations.
- [Laughs]

12:52.404 --> 12:54.565
[Man] It's so nice to see
someone's having a good time.

- A soldier, right?

13:01.547 --> 13:03.515
Actually, he's a marine.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.279
Hmm. Right. Can I talk with you?

13:07.386 --> 13:11.652
I'm getting 20 phone calls an hour
from some Kusang representative.

13:11.757 --> 13:14.123
They have a reporter
from some local rag up my ass...

13:14.226 --> 13:17.423
for an interview I do not want to give,
and some Greenpeace lawyer...

13:17.530 --> 13:19.498
trying to hit me with injunctions.

13:19.598 --> 13:22.965
- So could you just please
do your job now, thank you?
- Absolutely. On my way.

13:23.068 --> 13:25.229
It was a pleasure.

13:26.705 --> 13:28.673
- We need to replace the champagne.
- Yes, sir.

13:28.774 --> 13:31.265

I would not give to my dog.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.896
What's that kid doing fishing on the beach?

13:50.996 --> 13:53.658
[Man] May I suggest an
electrical fence for these darkies?

13:53.766 --> 13:56.530

Marine Corps, don't they--

but it was a good one.

20:31.396 --> 20:34.297
That reporter was nosing around again.

20:34.399 --> 20:36.765
Only this time,
he was pestering Mr. Chevault...

20:36.868 --> 20:40.804
about his opinion on the Greenpeace
legal action against me.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.397
Need I remind you that Mr. Chevault
is one of our major shareholders?

20:43.508 --> 20:45.476
So that is just not acceptable.

20:45.577 --> 20:48.068
My apologies, Mr. Conner.
I'll get right on it.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.149
Oh, please, now that the damage is done--
I mean--

20:51.250 --> 20:54.083
-Joe.
- Oh, great. G.I. Joe's here.

20:54.186 --> 20:57.883
What? You got an opinion?
Or you just gonna kick my ass?

20:57.990 --> 21:00.151
[Chuckles]
No, sir.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.057
See, unlike some,
I don't pick on women half my size.

21:03.161 --> 21:05.254
- Oh.
- And "G.I." is army, moron.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.924
I'm a marine.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.331
- Okay, Joe. It's fine.
- No, Robin, it's not.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.030
Hey, hey. It's fine. Joe? Please. It's fine.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.908
Number 1-- I'm sorry about that.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.478
It will not happen again.

21:20.579 --> 21:24.174
Number 2-- The reason you're
having trouble with the reporter...

21:24.283 --> 21:28.845
is because you constantly ignore my
recommendation to just give him 20 minutes.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.946
- 20 minutes of your time.
- I'm not gonna talk with any reporter about--

21:32.057 --> 21:35.356
You answer the questions you want,
and when he brings up the injunctions...

21:35.460 --> 21:37.826
you smile sweetly
and say it's all being worked out.

21:37.929 --> 21:39.920
It can only help you look better...

21:40.032 --> 21:42.398
and not like a rich American outsider
with something to hide.

21:44.069 --> 21:46.469
However, first things first.

21:46.571 --> 21:49.938
You have an opening speech to give.

21:51.109 --> 21:53.009
Okay.

21:56.782 --> 21:59.649
[Robin] Good evening,
friends, colleagues and investors.

21:59.751 --> 22:03.517
I would like to introduce you to our host,
the chairman of Conner Industries...

22:03.622 --> 22:05.613
Mr. Darren Conner.

22:05.724 --> 22:07.715
- [Applause]
- Thanks.

22:10.128 --> 22:14.224
Ladies and gentlemen, you honor me
by being the first official guests...

22:14.333 --> 22:17.166
of our magnificent new experience.

22:17.269 --> 22:19.669
Welcome to the Tanjalla Beach Resort...

22:19.771 --> 22:21.739
where you will never have to ask yourself...

22:21.840 --> 22:24.502
"Why shouldn't I have it all?"

22:24.609 --> 22:26.577
[Guests Applauding]

22:26.678 --> 22:29.511
You know, before I created Tanjalla,
there was nothing here--

22:29.614 --> 22:32.708
Well, nothing but a wasted opportunity.

22:32.818 --> 22:37.687
This fabulous island was flawed
by inefficiency, archaic thinking...

22:37.789 --> 22:42.226
and a subsequent lack of employment
for the local population.

22:42.327 --> 22:44.318
But I have changed all that.

22:45.497 --> 22:50.833
Water, fire, earth, air--

22:50.936 --> 22:54.201
- They are not only--
- Hey, marine! [Laughs]

22:54.306 --> 22:58.140
- [Firecracker Pops]
- Crazy-ass powder monkey.

23:00.212 --> 23:03.079
Hey, man.
How many jobs you got anyway?

23:03.181 --> 23:05.172
Oh, I've been known to moonlight.

23:05.283 --> 23:08.446
Gonna have a good show tonight.

23:08.553 --> 23:10.851
Here. Look at this. Get a kick outta this.

23:10.956 --> 23:14.448
Pop flare. I throw it up at the end
for old times' sake.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.925
Ah. Military's night light.

23:17.028 --> 23:19.019
Nobody else gets it, but I don't give a shit.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.962
Hmm.

23:21.066 --> 23:24.467
[Applause]

23:24.569 --> 23:28.528
What's goin' on?
You and the little woman havin' a thing?

23:28.640 --> 23:31.939
Her boss was bein' an asshole, and somehow...

23:32.043 --> 23:34.068
I'm the bad guy.

23:34.179 --> 23:36.807
Yeah, well, don't take it personal, all right?

23:36.915 --> 23:39.440
You gotta remember,
she's on her own most of the time.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.951
Can't be waitin' around
for your sorry ass to show up.

23:42.053 --> 23:44.112
Be all macho for her, right?
[Chuckles]

23:44.222 --> 23:46.213
- Yeah.
- Look, brother...

23:46.324 --> 23:49.987
I'm not the kind of guy
to be givin' a lot of advice.

23:50.095 --> 23:52.791
If I were you, I'd polish off those kneepads...

23:52.898 --> 23:55.799
head back up there
and tell her how sorry I was.

23:55.901 --> 23:59.928
Couple young things like you-- I can guarantee
you, the make-up sex would be well worth it.

24:00.038 --> 24:02.472
[Chuckles]
That how you did it?

24:02.574 --> 24:04.565
Nope.

24:04.676 --> 24:08.271
Yeah, look at me now, right?
King of the world, Ma.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.577
- [Laughs]
- Yeah, I guess so.

24:11.683 --> 24:14.481
Mmm. Go on. Beat it.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.577
I'm about to light this place up.

24:16.688 --> 24:19.623
Solar energy from the sun.

24:19.724 --> 24:21.783
Hydroelectric from the ocean.

24:21.893 --> 24:24.123
Geothermal from the earth.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.197
And the harnessing of wind.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.165
On behalf of Conner Industries,
I thank you...

24:29.267 --> 24:34.261
and wish you a very enjoyable vacation.

24:34.372 --> 24:37.603
- Here's to it!
- [Man] Yeah! Hear, hear! Bravo!

24:50.956 --> 24:53.049
- Nice job.
- These hicks wouldn't know...

24:53.158 --> 24:55.820
a thermodynamic converter from a hot fart.

24:55.927 --> 24:58.361
All they care is it says
"please recycle" on it.

24:58.463 --> 25:01.193
- What's next?
- Mingling with guests.

25:11.810 --> 25:15.143
Excuse me. Mr. Conner? Hate to interrupt.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.374
[Boom]

25:17.482 --> 25:19.780
[Whistling]

25:32.964 --> 25:34.124

25:41.706 --> 25:44.334
[Man]

26:21.546 --> 26:23.946
Get down. Get down!

26:43.268 --> 26:47.136

No! No!

27:02.354 --> 27:05.517
- [Man's Voice] He's gone.
-Joe!

[Groans]

27:49.567 --> 27:51.694
[Man]
Stop screaming.

27:54.305 --> 27:56.296
Now you just stop right there.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.376
Who are you?

27:58.476 --> 28:02.037
- What-- What do you think you're doing here?
- Hello, Mr. Conner.

28:08.319 --> 28:11.288
- [Grunts]
- [Conner Groans]

28:12.323 --> 28:14.416
[Grunting, Groaning]

28:22.467 --> 28:24.094
Joe!

28:26.905 --> 28:29.669
Come on. Get up, buddy.
Gotta get outta here.

28:29.774 --> 28:32.072
Let's go. Let's go. Come on.

28:32.177 --> 28:35.772
- [Explosion]
-Joe!

28:35.880 --> 28:37.848
Robin.

28:39.984 --> 28:43.112
[Church]
Stay calm. You've been out a couple hours.

28:45.323 --> 28:47.314
[Grunts]

28:56.000 --> 28:57.991
She still inside?

29:14.552 --> 29:17.783
[Exhales, Grunts]

29:22.727 --> 29:24.888
[Indistinct Conversations]

29:24.996 --> 29:26.964
[Man]
Okay. You have floor plan for hotel?

29:27.065 --> 29:31.092
- [Man #2] Right here.
- Get some more bandages.

29:31.202 --> 29:34.399
[Overlapping Conversations]

29:39.677 --> 29:41.736
[Man]
Right here, sir.

29:47.552 --> 29:50.020
It's gonna be okay.
Local authorities are on it.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.112
Just try to relax, all right?

29:52.223 --> 29:55.556
Hey! We're on TV. It's on TV now.

30:00.098 --> 30:03.693
Early reports of a terrorist attack
on Tanjalla Beach Resort...

30:03.802 --> 30:06.498
capturing as many as 20 hostages.

30:06.604 --> 30:11.007
We have confirmation that this video,
uploaded via Internet minutes ago...

30:11.109 --> 30:15.102
- comes from inside the resort.
- [Crowd Clamoring]

30:19.984 --> 30:23.010
[Conner]
Please-- All right! Don 't!

30:23.121 --> 30:25.214
Robin.

30:25.323 --> 30:29.054
For the last century
we have watched helplessly...

30:29.160 --> 30:31.151
as the disease of the Western world...

30:31.262 --> 30:34.288
has spread across our islands.

30:34.399 --> 30:36.890
Now it is your turn to watch.

30:37.001 --> 30:40.994
We will kill all the hostages in 24 hours.

30:41.105 --> 30:44.233
If you wish to spare their lives...

30:44.342 --> 30:46.970
you must pay tribute.

30:47.078 --> 30:51.515
- Tribute?
- Infidels. That's you and me, buddy.

30:51.616 --> 30:53.914
They gotta pay tribute for their crimes.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.816
- [Man] Like money.
- Ransom.

31:05.430 --> 31:08.160
[Man]
What? No, no.

31:08.266 --> 31:13.169
- No!
- [Clamoring]

31:15.673 --> 31:17.698
Don't watch this, kid.

31:17.809 --> 31:20.835
- [Shouting]
- [Crowd Clamoring]

31:27.185 --> 31:29.312
No!

31:46.204 --> 31:50.072
You gotta help me... get her back.

31:50.174 --> 31:52.734
Ho, ho. Oh, whoa. Time-out here.

31:52.844 --> 31:55.438
Look, there's nothing we can do about that.

31:55.546 --> 31:58.447
It's the military's job.

31:58.549 --> 32:01.484
Listen, brother,
I was never a hero, all right?

32:01.586 --> 32:04.054
Okay in a group, part of a team...

32:04.155 --> 32:06.555
but somethin' like this?

32:06.658 --> 32:08.751
No. I'm sorry, man.

32:08.860 --> 32:10.851
Sorry. Can't do it.

- Stop!
- Shh, shh, shh.

32:45.096 --> 32:48.623
Listen to me. We will do whatever you want.

32:48.733 --> 32:51.531
Just don't hurt anyone.

32:51.636 --> 32:53.695
You don't have to threaten us, okay?

32:53.805 --> 32:55.773
We can't identify you.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.166
We haven't seen your faces.

32:59.277 --> 33:01.575
No!

33:06.784 --> 33:09.014
Now you have.

33:36.447 --> 33:39.848
- Stay calm.
- I wanna see my family.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.249
For the love of Christ,
just stay calm. Stay calm.

33:44.355 --> 33:47.381
- Who are these people?
- [Robin] They're separatists--

33:47.492 --> 33:50.052
fighting the spread of
Western influence on their country.

33:51.929 --> 33:57.697
You know what?
People are working on getting us out. Okay?

33:57.802 --> 34:01.636
- So we just gotta stay calm, and think
with clear heads.  - [Man] You're right.

34:04.642 --> 34:07.770
[Woman Screams]
No!

34:12.750 --> 34:16.811
After that broadcast,
there is no way for us to keep this quiet.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.516
What?

34:20.625 --> 34:22.786
Makil Shoal--

34:22.893 --> 34:25.987
diplomatic adviser on behalf
of the Kusang government.

34:31.902 --> 34:35.339
- Blueprints to the resort.
- [Man Shouting In Distance]

34:40.078 --> 34:42.170
We have the perimeter surrounded.

34:44.382 --> 34:46.873
But I will not attack...

34:46.984 --> 34:49.110
until we know more about the terrorists.

34:49.219 --> 34:51.916
That's all right, Commander.
I'm taking care of this.

34:52.023 --> 34:53.322
Who's in charge?

34:53.523 --> 34:57.723
Sir! This is off-limits.
Please wait over there.

34:57.829 --> 35:02.129
No. Somebody's gonna talk to me. Now.

35:03.334 --> 35:06.098
Wait.

35:06.204 --> 35:08.138
Let me.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.671
[Shoal]
I apologize for that.

35:17.782 --> 35:20.842
You know, dealing with the military--

35:20.952 --> 35:24.285
It's like playing chicken with a brick wall.

35:24.388 --> 35:27.824
- No offense, of course.
- What's being done about the hostages?

35:27.925 --> 35:31.691
- I'm afraid I can't discuss it with you, Mr.--
-Joe.

35:33.231 --> 35:35.859
2 days is unacceptable.
I will be dead tomorrow.

35:37.034 --> 35:39.264
Just make it happen.

35:43.207 --> 35:45.198
The money is on its way.

35:45.309 --> 35:51.009
- Tribute.  - Yeah, sure. Tribute.
Whatever you wanna call it.

35:51.115 --> 35:55.518
You touch just one hair on my head--
You can kiss it all good-bye.

36:04.762 --> 36:06.787
Look, just let us go.

36:06.898 --> 36:09.833
The money is on its way.

36:09.934 --> 36:12.027
You got what you want.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.766
No. I got what I asked for.

36:18.943 --> 36:21.878
We were living in paradise
long before the Great White Hope...

36:21.979 --> 36:26.348
came to our shores
to save us from our happiness.

36:26.450 --> 36:28.941
You don't know what I want!

36:39.597 --> 36:41.997
Think it's working?

36:42.099 --> 36:44.590
Either way, little brother,
the message will be sent.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.761
It's all falling into place.

36:50.007 --> 36:52.407
This is a political disaster.

36:52.510 --> 36:54.671
[Sighs]

36:54.779 --> 36:57.077
I am the one who convinced my government...

36:57.181 --> 37:01.083
to allow Conner Industries to purchase
the old resort from the local owners.

37:01.185 --> 37:04.916
Now I have to negotiate
the release of the hostages.

37:05.022 --> 37:07.013
I can't believe this is happening.

37:07.124 --> 37:09.718
I'm with Conner Security.
Are you sending in troops?

37:09.827 --> 37:13.024
Ohh, my government is extremely reticent...

37:13.130 --> 37:15.189
to engage in military action.

37:15.299 --> 37:17.733
If they should storm in
and the hostages are killed...

37:17.835 --> 37:20.861
we could have a-- an international incident.

37:20.972 --> 37:23.202
And we're still waiting on word
from the U.S....

37:23.307 --> 37:26.367
which means they're waiting
to see how we deal with the problem.

37:26.477 --> 37:29.708
So what do you plan to do?

37:29.814 --> 37:32.044
- I've already done it.
- [Vehicle Approaching]

37:46.330 --> 37:50.164
- Mercenaries.
- Better trained than most of our soldiers.

37:50.268 --> 37:52.395
And accustomed to dirty work.

37:52.503 --> 37:54.698
[Man]
Get out.

37:56.741 --> 37:59.039
Skunk. How are you?

38:00.911 --> 38:02.902
Hey, thanks.

01:14:12.673 --> 01:14:15.733
to take back what was stolen from us.

01:14:17.845 --> 01:14:20.575
To be perfectly honest, at this point...

01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:23.149
all I care about is the money.

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:25.811
[Joe]
You killed the mercenaries.

01:14:27.955 --> 01:14:30.480
Just sent them to die.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:34.960
That was my part of the deal.
I send in the mercenaries.

01:14:35.062 --> 01:14:39.795
Their failure forces
the military to stand down.

01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.959
I just had to be sure they failed.

01:14:42.069 --> 01:14:45.095
Then why should Damo keep you alive?

01:14:45.206 --> 01:14:48.300
We are freedom fighters, he and I.

01:14:48.409 --> 01:14:51.867
- And Damo wouldn't kill a brother.
- [Door Opens]

01:15:02.556 --> 01:15:06.253
The tribute is in the accounts.

01:15:08.329 --> 01:15:11.196
How about my portion?

01:15:12.633 --> 01:15:15.363
Oh, don't worry. You'll get your share.

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:18.404
Plus, a bonus.

01:15:18.506 --> 01:15:20.633
Thought you freedom fighters
didn't care about money.

01:15:20.741 --> 01:15:25.804
Because we live in caves and eat bugs.

01:15:25.913 --> 01:15:28.711
Our money doesn't go to Happy Meals.

01:15:28.816 --> 01:15:31.876
Weapons, warriors.

01:15:31.986 --> 01:15:36.548
A thousand more men like me
dedicated to the cause.

01:15:36.657 --> 01:15:38.625
Plus, a few other goodies.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.860
Hey. Hey.

01:15:48.969 --> 01:15:52.166
What are you guys doing?
Hey, what are you doing?

01:15:52.273 --> 01:15:54.366
- Finishing what we started.
- Hey--

01:15:54.475 --> 01:15:56.602
These noble volunteers...

01:15:56.711 --> 01:15:59.441
will help us bring down this
monstrosity once and for all.

01:15:59.547 --> 01:16:01.845
You got your money, right?
You sent your message.

01:16:04.485 --> 01:16:07.113
This... is the message.

01:16:07.221 --> 01:16:10.349
I helped you. I helped the cause.

01:16:10.458 --> 01:16:14.519
Don't make us laugh.
You're a worm who thinks he's a crow.

01:16:14.628 --> 01:16:17.893
- You couldn't have done this without me.
- Finally, Shoal--

01:16:17.998 --> 01:16:20.933
You get something--

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:23.936
- [Beeps]
- exactly right.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:26.199
Please!
[Grunts]

01:16:26.307 --> 01:16:29.071
- Please!
- Make us laugh, freedom fighter!

01:16:29.176 --> 01:16:32.737
No! No!
[Yells]

01:16:32.847 --> 01:16:34.838
[Hostages Gasping]

01:16:43.190 --> 01:16:45.590
Like you say in your book, Mr. Conner...

01:16:45.693 --> 01:16:47.786
why shouldn't I have it all?

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:49.419
[Muffled]
Bastard.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.299
- We had a deal! You've got to let them go!
- [Women Whimpering]

01:16:56.404 --> 01:16:58.964
You got the money! You got me!

01:17:00.608 --> 01:17:03.236
[Damo]
You disapprove?

01:17:03.344 --> 01:17:07.610
You've never sacrificed innocents
to get the job done?

01:17:07.715 --> 01:17:10.343
Innocents always die in war.

01:17:11.752 --> 01:17:14.619
But the goal is to save people...

01:17:14.722 --> 01:17:17.418
not kill them to win.

01:17:17.525 --> 01:17:19.857
- [Sobbing]
- You see?

01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:22.986
You do understand what it means
to make a statement.

01:17:26.567 --> 01:17:30.298
Robin! Robin!

01:17:30.404 --> 01:17:32.599
He's all yours.

01:17:34.608 --> 01:17:36.940
[Blade Scraping]

01:17:37.044 --> 01:17:41.777
[Sobbing] Please.
[Screams]

01:18:31.866 --> 01:18:34.164
[Straining, Screaming]

01:18:43.444 --> 01:18:45.002

01:18:54.154 --> 01:18:56.987
[Bone Cracks]

01:19:23.317 --> 01:19:25.683
[Damo On Radio]
Are they secured?

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:35.684
Are the hostages secured?
Somebody come back. Are they secured?

01:19:38.666 --> 01:19:40.896
Are they secured?

01:19:41.001 --> 01:19:43.162
- [Bones Cracking]
- [Screaming]

01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:45.670
[Damo On Radio]
Somebody talk to me. Come back!

01:19:45.773 --> 01:19:48.071
[Yells]

01:19:50.744 --> 01:19:53.178
[Damo On Radio]
Do you hear me?

01:20:01.021 --> 01:20:03.080
Come in. Are they secured?

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:08.853
[Gunshot]

01:20:11.131 --> 01:20:14.430
Brother, talk to me. Come back.
Are they secured?

01:20:16.103 --> 01:20:18.503
They teach you that in the army? Nice shot.

01:20:18.606 --> 01:20:20.631
It was dumb luck. What can I say?

01:20:22.042 --> 01:20:24.169
Thanks.

01:20:24.278 --> 01:20:26.508
- Church.
- [Damo] Come in, brother. Do you hear me?

01:20:26.614 --> 01:20:28.548
Go get him.

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:33.845
- Start cuttin'. Hurry up.
- Okay.

01:20:36.056 --> 01:20:38.115
Are you there, brother?

01:20:38.225 --> 01:20:41.854
- Move, move, move!
- Come in. Are they secured?

01:20:44.264 --> 01:20:48.564
- Are the prisoners secured? Someone
come back, now!  - They're comin'.

01:20:48.669 --> 01:20:51.467
Go back. Kill them all.

01:20:51.572 --> 01:20:53.904
- Yes, sir.
- No!

01:21:04.351 --> 01:21:07.809
- [Beeping]
- [Church] Hurry it up!

01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:09.548
This place is wired to blow!

01:21:10.791 --> 01:21:12.053
Move 'em out of here!

01:21:28.442 --> 01:21:30.774
[Shouting, Indistinct]

01:21:35.949 --> 01:21:38.383
- Run! Run!
- Pick it up! Come on!

01:21:38.485 --> 01:21:40.885
Come on, people! Move!

- [Gasping]
- Here! You're gonna be okay.

01:22:02.309 --> 01:22:03.901
- Can you use this?
- Sure, sure.

01:22:04.011 --> 01:22:05.638
Just point and pull the trigger. Go!

01:22:07.347 --> 01:22:09.212
[Beeping]

01:22:30.938 --> 01:22:35.341
[Panicked Chattering]

01:22:35.442 --> 01:22:37.103
Everybody, move in now!

01:23:07.374 --> 01:23:09.433
Joe!

01:23:09.543 --> 01:23:13.274
I'm over here! Let me go!

01:23:21.755 --> 01:23:23.814
Bomb--

01:23:28.061 --> 01:23:31.121
-Joe! A bomb!

01:24:06.767 --> 01:24:11.568
[Conner]
Well, thank God you all made it out.

01:24:42.736 --> 01:24:44.829
Hell of a show, huh?

01:25:26.446 --> 01:25:28.505
[Bird Twittering]

01:25:33.186 --> 01:25:35.416
Where'd they go? Which way?

01:25:37.691 --> 01:25:39.682
This guy won't die.

01:26:06.119 --> 01:26:07.677
[Gunshot]

01:26:16.763 --> 01:26:21.632

- Robin!

01:28:25.225 --> 01:28:28.922
Get me out of here! Quick! Get me out!

Leave him alone!

01:29:23.450 --> 01:29:27.011
This will never stop with the tribute.

01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:29.247
- There'll be a thousand more like me!
- No!

01:29:29.356 --> 01:29:31.586
It ends with you!

Go, go, go...!

01:30:43.163 --> 01:30:45.358
I thought my job was dangerous.
