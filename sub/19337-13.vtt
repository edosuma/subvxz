You were right.
As long as Mary's alive,

00:04.405 --> 00:06.638
there will always be Catholics
who want her on your throne.

00:06.640 --> 00:09.508
Unless you share it with
someone of their faith.

00:09.510 --> 00:10.776
Archduke Ferdinand,
you certainly have

00:10.778 --> 00:12.644
risen above your competition.

00:12.646 --> 00:15.147
I am well aware you've been
looking for a Catholic king.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.382
A king's confidence

00:16.384 --> 00:17.616
is essential.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.151
And you are a source

00:19.153 --> 00:21.253
of Charles' confidence.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.489
And you are the source
of my happiness.

He wants the Crown Matrimonial
very badly.

00:41.275 --> 00:45.277
You must never let him

00:45.279 --> 00:46.545
With the right people

wishing to be king,

03:32.613 --> 03:35.714
who agitates Protestants

Let's hope it's enough to calm
the jittery nerves

04:06.714 --> 04:10.515

and avoid civil war.

04:10.517 --> 04:13.418
I hear that Charles'
peasant lover, Nicole,

04:13.420 --> 04:15.020

Yes.

She wants time away

affections.

Well, that's the price you

04:25.766 --> 04:27.599

04:27.601 --> 04:29.601
Is it really so bad?

04:29.603 --> 04:31.837
Each day I receive

04:31.839 --> 04:34.773
some pointless gift.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.642

04:36.644 --> 04:40.012

Oh, such a burden.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.931

Your antagonistic way

06:37.131 --> 06:39.097
And what favor does he ask
of them in return?

06:39.099 --> 06:40.732
He's requested
a special vote.

06:40.734 --> 06:41.933
One that gives him
the Crown Matrimonial.

06:41.935 --> 06:44.002
Over my objections?

06:44.004 --> 06:45.837
The privy council
has such power.

06:45.839 --> 06:47.406
If Darnley is granted
the Crown Matrimonial,

06:47.408 --> 06:48.607
it makes him my equal.

06:48.609 --> 06:50.542
But in their eyes, my superior!

06:50.544 --> 06:51.943
And because
he is a man,

06:51.945 --> 06:54.479
the privy council will
look to him and not me.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.815
We cannot let him succeed,

06:56.817 --> 06:59.451
or they will be one step closer
to eliminating me.

06:59.453 --> 07:02.988
I need a plan that gives
me power with the privy council.

07:02.990 --> 07:07.626
If I can force them
to take my side over Darnley's,

07:07.628 --> 07:10.529
then I'll be able
to protect my throne.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.597

that just may work.

Lord Chancellor.

Don't tell me they
sent you to greet me.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.546
Oh, I thought
it'd give us some time

07:27.548 --> 07:28.613
to spend together
informally

07:28.615 --> 07:29.781
before we begin
our negotiations.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.016
Well, wonderful.

07:31.018 --> 07:32.617
Then may I ask, informally,

why the king's brother Henri
has become so...

07:34.788 --> 07:36.521

French politics?

07:36.523 --> 07:38.790
Ah, he supports the king,
nothing more.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.859
And the Spanish galleons
anchored off shore,

07:40.861 --> 07:42.928

support the king?

Spain share a very close tie.

France objects to your use

08:16.997 --> 08:18.230
Your English lords
were not murdered,

08:18.232 --> 08:19.865
they were executed

08:21.502 --> 08:23.101

Really?

08:23.103 --> 08:25.971
There will be no apology,

And no payment.

08:27.708 --> 08:30.108
As for the ships, England
may buy them back.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.912
France is owed taxes,
and we intend to collect.

08:33.914 --> 08:37.582
However, as I am not
an unreasonable man,

08:37.584 --> 08:40.185
I might be persuaded
to give back

08:40.187 --> 08:42.921
the ships' cargo as
a sign of good will.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.857
In the eyes of the world,

08:45.859 --> 08:48.593
you have committed murder
and theft.

08:48.595 --> 08:51.062
A military response from England
will be seen as justified.

08:51.064 --> 08:55.534
So I strongly urge you
to reconsider your position.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.739
(door closes)

09:00.741 --> 09:01.773
How are the negotiations going?

09:01.775 --> 09:03.208
We're still talking.

09:03.210 --> 09:05.210
Whatever you do, do not
give England the cargo

09:05.212 --> 09:07.612
from the ships.
Why?

09:07.614 --> 09:10.549
Because we've been handed
an unexpected gift.

09:10.551 --> 09:13.151
The cargo is saltpeter.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.986
The English transport
it from North Africa

09:14.988 --> 09:17.956
to make gunpowder. Gunpowder
they will use against France.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.191
Or Spain.
Oh, how tragic for Spain.

09:20.193 --> 09:22.127
And tell me, is Spain aware

09:22.129 --> 09:24.062
of this cargo
captured in France?

09:24.064 --> 09:27.599
You told your
sister, the queen.

09:27.601 --> 09:30.201
She's requested that we divert
the saltpeter to Spain.

09:30.203 --> 09:31.703
So, now Spain asks you to meddle

09:31.705 --> 09:33.772
in France's affairs
on their behalf.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.073
I'm working with Spain
to clean up the mess

09:35.075 --> 09:36.975
that Charles has created
with England.

09:36.977 --> 09:38.777
All they ask for
in return is the saltpeter

09:38.779 --> 09:40.045
to make
ammunition.

09:40.047 --> 09:41.613
I am working with Spain.

09:41.615 --> 09:45.350
And you would be wise
to work with me.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.086
(birds squawking)

09:48.088 --> 09:50.789
This is a glorious day
for all of Scotland.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.691
God has smiled upon us.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.993
I stand before you
with great joy,

09:54.995 --> 09:57.696
to announce to you,
and the world,

09:57.698 --> 10:00.732
that I am blessed and honored
to carry within me an heir.

10:00.734 --> 10:04.002
(cheering, applause)

10:04.004 --> 10:07.806
An heir with a claim to both the
Scottish and English thrones.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.346
I think it would please them
very much

10:14.348 --> 10:17.248
to hear from the father.

10:17.250 --> 10:21.052
ALL (chanting): Long live
the king! Long live the king!

10:21.054 --> 10:25.256
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

10:25.258 --> 10:26.691
Long live the king!

10:26.693 --> 10:27.959
The queen and I

10:27.961 --> 10:30.195
are very much looking forward

10:30.197 --> 10:31.630
to the arrival of our child.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.832
And we thank you
for allowing us

10:33.834 --> 10:36.334
to share this blessed
news with you.

10:36.336 --> 10:39.270
(all cheering, clamoring)

10:44.778 --> 10:46.845
Thank you.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.780
(indistinct chatter)

10:52.953 --> 10:55.186
That was a brilliant move.
But how did you know

10:55.188 --> 10:56.821
that Darnley wouldn't
make good on his threat

10:56.823 --> 10:58.156
and deny the child was his?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.858
I didn't give him time to think.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.094
My husband is
not a complex man.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.096
He just wants to be
loved and adored.

11:05.098 --> 11:08.900
I simply gave him an
opportunity to feed his ego.

11:08.902 --> 11:10.368
(chuckles)

11:13.040 --> 11:15.140
Well, now that you've claimed
the child as your own,

11:15.142 --> 11:17.409
you've given up
our leverage with the queen.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.310
We'll need a new way
to rid ourselves of her.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.379
Rid ourselves?

11:21.381 --> 11:23.882
I'm not looking to do away
with Mary.

11:23.884 --> 11:26.151
All I want is
the Crown Matrimonial...

11:26.153 --> 11:27.852
to be her equal.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.187
Thanks to you,
it's now too late for that.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.456
So, you want to kill her?

11:31.458 --> 11:33.124
Is that what
you're suggesting?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.893
She carries the future heir.

11:34.895 --> 11:37.028
No one, not even a child,
is innocent.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.130
And as long as this woman
is allowed to draw breath,

11:39.132 --> 11:42.167
she will continue to ruin
this land as completely

11:42.169 --> 11:44.803
as she has ruined everything
and everyone that I love.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.773
There has to be another way.

11:48.775 --> 11:51.009
Well, I'm afraid
I'm out of ideas...

11:51.011 --> 11:52.210
unless you've got one?

11:54.347 --> 11:56.748
Think hard.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.794
I've received news
from Bothwell.

12:09.796 --> 12:10.929
Your plan was a success.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.330
Nearly all the
council members

12:12.332 --> 12:13.998
who were prepared
to grant Darnley

12:14.000 --> 12:16.101
the Crown Matrimonial
have changed their minds.

12:16.103 --> 12:17.836
They know that
it will make them

12:17.838 --> 12:19.337
very unpopular
to vote against a queen

12:19.339 --> 12:21.372
who carries the heir
to the throne.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.041
How many minds
have remained unchanged?

12:23.043 --> 12:24.476
Only one that matters.

12:24.478 --> 12:26.911
Lord Ruthven.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.514
We already know
that the lord treasurer

12:29.516 --> 12:34.753
isn't above accepting bribes,
but I'm willing to bet

12:34.755 --> 12:37.322
that his dishonesty
goes further than that.

12:37.324 --> 12:38.490
You're familiar
with bookkeeping.

12:38.492 --> 12:40.391
I would like you

12:40.393 --> 12:42.393
to find
the privy council ledgers

12:42.395 --> 12:44.429
and see if there's evidence

12:44.431 --> 12:46.131
of any further
financial wrongdoing.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.400
I'll request the ledger at once.

12:49.402 --> 12:51.503
David.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.775
I don't know how to thank you
for all you've done for me.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.843
With my brother,
James, gone,

12:58.845 --> 13:01.780
and Greer away...

13:01.782 --> 13:04.082
I feel as though
I can trust you with my life.

13:04.084 --> 13:06.084
You can.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.052
This is my home now.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.889
And you are my friend.

13:10.891 --> 13:13.158
Thank you.

13:13.160 --> 13:16.261
A queen doesn't have
many friends.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.463
I treasure you.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.499
(chuckles lightly)

13:23.804 --> 13:25.403
HENRI:
<i> With Charles in Paris, </i>
<i> I thought we could</i>

13:25.405 --> 13:27.138
<i> get to know each other</i>
<i> a little better.</i>

13:27.140 --> 13:28.473
Is that what
this stroll is?

13:28.475 --> 13:30.942
Yes. You're important
to my brother and my family,

13:30.944 --> 13:32.343
and I realized
I hardly know you.

13:32.345 --> 13:33.945
Yet, you thought you
knew me well enough

13:33.947 --> 13:35.480
to tell me that I'm
with the wrong man.

13:35.482 --> 13:38.216
Because I know Narcisse and
I was trying to protect you.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.084
Protect me? Why?
You hardly know me.

13:40.086 --> 13:41.319
Which brings us back

13:41.321 --> 13:43.588
to why I asked you on a stroll.

13:43.590 --> 13:45.223
So, let's start
at the beginning.

13:45.225 --> 13:48.092
Tell me how you came
to be here at court.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.094
I'm sure you've heard my story.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.463
The simple farm girl who rose
to become the king's mistress.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.098
You're so much
more than that.

13:54.100 --> 13:57.602
I don't think my brother
would be king without you.

13:57.604 --> 13:58.970
Charles is quite capable.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.371
With you whispering
in his ear

14:00.373 --> 14:01.973
after Narcisse has
whispered in yours.

14:01.975 --> 14:04.976
You think Narcisse
is manipulating me?

14:04.978 --> 14:06.845
I think you're a beautiful,
ambitious, young woman

14:06.847 --> 14:08.513
who's learned
to pull the strings of men,

14:08.515 --> 14:11.316
and yet can't see when her
own strings are being pulled.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.251
You're still
a naive farm girl at heart.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.253
You don't know
what you're talking about.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.121
Thanks for the stroll.

14:17.123 --> 14:19.991
He doesn't love you any more
than you love my brother.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.428
Meet me tomorrow,
I'll prove it to you...

14:23.430 --> 14:24.596
before he breaks your heart.

14:28.568 --> 14:31.402
As for your demands,
on further review,

14:31.404 --> 14:33.605
France's position
has changed.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.273
I'm glad to hear that.

14:35.275 --> 14:37.342
You still have the option
to buy back the ships,

14:37.344 --> 14:40.311
but I'm afraid the cargo
is now property of France.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.547
You were prepared
to return the cargo.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.582
But you failed to disclose
the contents of the cargo:

14:44.584 --> 14:45.950
saltpeter.

14:45.952 --> 14:47.452
A fertilizer.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.020
Oh, don't patronize me.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.889
We both know it is used
to produce gunpowder.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.024
This is hardly a negotiation.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.293
Your hard-line stance
threatens war with England.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.494
Why would you risk that?

14:56.496 --> 14:58.229
I can't help but feel

14:58.231 --> 15:01.366
you're driven by something
much more personal.

15:01.368 --> 15:03.301
Revenge.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.471
My queen
executed your wife.

15:06.473 --> 15:09.040
I understand your bitterness,
but don't let your grudge

15:09.042 --> 15:11.242
push our countries to war.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.244
Elizabeth had no choice.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.679
She suffers from the
loss of Lola as well.

15:14.681 --> 15:15.947
Oh, she suffers?

15:15.949 --> 15:17.916
No one understands loss

15:17.918 --> 15:20.652
until they've felt it.

15:20.654 --> 15:23.988
I do.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.357
I lost my wife
and then my daughter.

15:26.359 --> 15:30.995
I went through a period
where I hated the whole world.

15:30.997 --> 15:33.097
And what helped you to recover?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.600
Love.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.336
And I don't mean just
finding someone to love.

15:38.338 --> 15:42.640
What healed me was
knowing that I was loved,

15:42.642 --> 15:45.076
more than I ever
thought possible.

15:50.083 --> 15:53.084
Well, I'm happy
for your good fortune.

15:53.086 --> 15:57.121
Allow yourself to love
and be loved again,

15:57.123 --> 15:59.958
or the bitterness
will just destroy you.

16:01.962 --> 16:04.696
That is wise advice.

16:04.698 --> 16:06.698
So I have some
advice for you.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.067
The Spanish are not here

16:09.069 --> 16:12.470
because France and Spain
are getting on well.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.239
They're there to show support
for Prince Henri.

16:15.241 --> 16:18.009
Imagine how that
makes the king feel.

16:18.011 --> 16:21.279
So I think if you were
to talk with King Charles,

16:21.281 --> 16:23.281
you would be surprised

16:23.283 --> 16:26.451
how receptive he might be
to your demands.

16:31.124 --> 16:34.092
Lord Ruthven, my advisor,
David Rizzio,

16:34.094 --> 16:37.261
has found some discrepancies
in the privy council ledger.

16:37.263 --> 16:39.731
You are responsible
for that ledger, are you not?

16:41.001 --> 16:43.568
Your advisor is obviously wrong.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.437
He has found proof

16:46.439 --> 16:49.007
that in addition
to cheating the Crown,

16:49.009 --> 16:51.009
you have also been swindling
your fellow nobles.

16:51.011 --> 16:53.144
How do you think
they will respond

16:53.146 --> 16:56.247
when they discover
the lord treasurer is a crook,

16:56.249 --> 16:57.782
stealing from them?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.550
Perhaps you should discuss this
with the king.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.320
I'm certain he will find that
I have done nothing wrong.

17:02.322 --> 17:05.523
If you expect Lord Darnley
to pardon you,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.025
it will do you no good,

17:07.027 --> 17:08.326
not if I make this public.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.594
You'll lose your standing,

17:09.596 --> 17:11.796
your reputation, your friends.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.498
And you will remain silent

17:13.500 --> 17:15.400
if I vote against giving Darnley
the Crown Matrimonial?

17:16.403 --> 17:18.036
What has happened to Scotland?

17:18.038 --> 17:20.705
The queen is more French
than Scottish...

17:20.707 --> 17:24.042
and takes the word of an Italian
over her own treasurer.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.277
I will keep my trust
in the king.

17:32.619 --> 17:35.486
Lord Ruthven, wait.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.255
What is it now?
I beg of you.

17:37.257 --> 17:39.424
Under no circumstances
must you allow Darnley

17:39.426 --> 17:41.659
to receive
the Crown Matrimonial.
Why?

17:41.661 --> 17:44.295
What new threat
does the queen offer?

17:44.297 --> 17:46.330
It's not a threat
from the queen.

17:46.332 --> 17:47.098
This is my threat alone.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.271
There are places
that men frequent

17:53.273 --> 17:56.808
when they desire the discreet
companionship of other men.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.343
You've been seen at such places.

17:59.345 --> 18:00.745
I'm married.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.780
Even so,

18:02.782 --> 18:05.316
you and I have known the company
of the same gentleman.

18:05.318 --> 18:09.487
You be very careful
what you're suggesting.

18:09.489 --> 18:12.557
We take no pleasure
in revealing your secret.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.158
It's not an easy life,

18:14.160 --> 18:17.728
desiring what we're told
we should not.

18:17.730 --> 18:21.466
But if you defy the queen,
I will make certain

18:21.468 --> 18:23.201
that everyone knows
we are the same,

18:23.203 --> 18:25.503
and not even the king
will be able to save you then.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.338
Nor you.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.108
You'll be burned
right alongside me.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.442
Are you prepared for that?

18:31.444 --> 18:35.713
For Mary... anything.

18:38.585 --> 18:40.751
How the hell did we
lose Ruthven?!

18:40.753 --> 18:43.221
He won't even discuss
the Crown Matrimonial.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.324
That was our last chance at
a peaceful transition of power.

18:46.326 --> 18:48.759
Time to take out Mary.
No.

18:48.761 --> 18:50.661
You asked me if I
had a better idea.

18:50.663 --> 18:52.330
I do.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.397
We can try Mary for adultery.

18:53.399 --> 18:54.499
Carnal lusting.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.134
Even though she's pregnant?

18:56.136 --> 18:57.735
Mary is a woman of passion.

18:57.737 --> 19:00.771
Whatever she feels,
desires, she must act upon.

19:00.773 --> 19:03.407
She once took me in the hallway
before our wedding.

19:03.409 --> 19:07.411
If her desires are not
being fulfilled with me,

19:07.413 --> 19:10.281
then surely with Bothwell.

19:10.283 --> 19:13.751
Women are capable
of ungodly things.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.688
We must catch
them together,

19:17.690 --> 19:19.724
with witnesses to make certain
she's found guilty of adultery.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.826
And then what?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.495
She'll be forced to abdicate.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.632
But she will... live?

19:27.634 --> 19:28.833
Yes.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.202
She'll be banished
or imprisoned,

19:31.204 --> 19:32.603
but she'll live.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.572
And the privy council
will empower me to rule.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.341
I am the father
of the next monarch.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.576
In a heartbeat.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.511
Adultery is a just cause.

19:40.513 --> 19:44.615
Once she's judged as immoral
and unfit, the Vatican itself

19:44.617 --> 19:46.417
will push her off the throne,
leaving you.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.253
And what about Bothwell?

19:51.591 --> 19:53.357
Well, that's up to the king.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.860
Well, in that case...

19:55.862 --> 19:57.929
I will have his head.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.805
ELIZABETH:
<i> I wasn't expecting</i>
<i> the archduke back so soon.</i>

20:07.807 --> 20:09.740
What do you think he wants?

20:09.742 --> 20:12.476
Was he not away to draw up
papers for your engagement?

20:12.478 --> 20:13.678
Perhaps he now wishes
your permission

20:13.680 --> 20:14.745
to make a formal
announcement.

20:14.747 --> 20:16.914
Do you think?

20:16.916 --> 20:19.217
Now that the world knows
Queen Mary is pregnant,

20:19.219 --> 20:22.220
I need this alliance
more than ever.

20:22.222 --> 20:24.622
But still, I can't help
but feel I'm cheating on Gideon.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.791
Lord Blackburn loves you as much
as any man has loved a woman.

20:26.793 --> 20:30.695
He understands
the situation.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.899
Smile.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.968
(sighs)

20:38.571 --> 20:39.937
(chuckles)

20:39.939 --> 20:41.806
(laughing):
My lord,

20:41.808 --> 20:44.308
you have certainly...

20:46.246 --> 20:47.445
What is it?

20:47.447 --> 20:51.249
"Your lips... hungry...

20:51.251 --> 20:53.684
"devour me.
They steal my breath.

20:53.686 --> 20:54.919
"Your body is mine.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.688
Our hearts beat
in joined ecstasy."

20:57.690 --> 20:59.390
I apologize for reading
your private papers.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.859
I was moving them
to make room for the flowers.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.628
Are you involved
with another man?

21:05.665 --> 21:07.598
You weren't supposed
to see those

21:07.600 --> 21:08.799
before our

21:08.801 --> 21:10.601
wedding night.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.036
I beg your pardon?

21:12.038 --> 21:13.704
Ever since we met,

21:13.706 --> 21:16.474
I can't stop thinking about you.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.875
Your...

21:17.877 --> 21:21.512
powerful gaze,
your confident stride.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.047
You've driven me mad
with desire.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.915
Which is
inappropriate

21:24.917 --> 21:26.717
for a queen.

21:26.719 --> 21:30.755
Especially a virgin queen.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.590
I've been inspired,

21:32.592 --> 21:35.559
by the things
that I've read in secret,

21:35.561 --> 21:39.764
to write down
my deepest longings,

21:39.766 --> 21:42.733
so that I might
share them with you

21:42.735 --> 21:44.602
after we were married.

21:44.604 --> 21:47.872
The queen of England
reads erotica?

21:47.874 --> 21:49.874
Mm-hmm.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.442
My queen,

21:51.444 --> 21:54.312
if I had only known
your feelings toward me,

21:54.314 --> 21:56.380
I could have spared us
so much grief.

21:56.382 --> 21:59.050
Because I feel
the same way.

21:59.052 --> 22:01.552
Forgive my boldness,
but is there any reason

22:01.554 --> 22:02.887
we should deny ourselves
any longer

22:02.889 --> 22:05.756
of something we both
so clearly want?

22:05.758 --> 22:08.893
I've returned from Austria
with my family's blessing.

22:08.895 --> 22:11.028
They've agreed
to your demands.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.331
We shall soon be
husband and wife.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.734
I can think of no reason at all.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.537
I will give flesh to your words.

22:21.007 --> 22:22.473
And I'll be gentle.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.708
Hmm.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.877
(exhales)

22:26.879 --> 22:29.013
That's remarkable.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.616
Subtle use of form without
sacrificing attention to detail.

22:32.618 --> 22:34.618
Is it a, uh--?

22:34.620 --> 22:36.587
It's a Da Vinci.
Ah.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.923
My grandfather
Francis purchased it.

22:38.925 --> 22:41.392
But you didn't come here

22:41.394 --> 22:43.060
to discuss my art collection,
did you?

22:43.062 --> 22:44.762
No, Your Majesty.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.063
I came with the hope
of resolving

22:46.065 --> 22:47.631
the situation in Granville.

22:47.633 --> 22:48.899
I understood Lord Narcisse

22:48.901 --> 22:50.901
was handling those negotiations.

22:50.903 --> 22:52.937
I've learned something
that is-is too sensitive

22:52.939 --> 22:54.839
for anyone except for
the king himself.

22:56.642 --> 23:00.378
Spain is trying to
influence the outcome.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.780
My investigation into the
disputed ships and their cargo

23:02.782 --> 23:04.515
has revealed that
your brother, Henri,

23:04.517 --> 23:06.384
intends to send
them to Spain,

23:06.386 --> 23:07.618
at Spain's behest.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.521
Tread lightly, Lord Blackburn.

23:10.523 --> 23:12.957
You are suggesting
that my brother

23:12.959 --> 23:14.492
goes behind my back
and works against me

23:14.494 --> 23:15.726
to do Spain's bidding.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.496
Forgive me if I am overstepping.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.731
As a diplomat,
it appears to me

23:20.733 --> 23:22.600
that Spain would like to see
our countries at war.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.869
They would use it as an
invitation to help France,

23:24.871 --> 23:29.039
stepping in and elevating
your brother's power.

23:29.041 --> 23:32.810
And if I were to return the
ships and cargo to England?

23:32.812 --> 23:34.979
Then there's no cause for war
between our countries.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.847
And you would have
shown Spain--

23:36.849 --> 23:39.784
and your brother--

23:39.786 --> 23:42.653
who truly wields
the power in France.

23:46.592 --> 23:47.958
Bothwell?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.293
You are in grave danger.

23:49.294 --> 23:50.627
I just received word
from one of my spies

23:50.628 --> 23:51.961
that your privy council is
planning to overthrow you,

23:51.964 --> 23:52.963
and your worthless traitor

23:52.965 --> 23:54.899
of a husband
is helping them.

23:54.901 --> 23:55.933
Darnley means
to remove you from power.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.635
I've asked Rizzio
to keep watch,

23:57.637 --> 23:58.736
but everyone at this court

23:58.738 --> 23:59.737
is a potential conspirator.

23:59.739 --> 24:00.905
The act of a desperate man.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.740
I have stopped all
of Darnley's attempts

24:02.742 --> 24:04.475
at gaining
the Crown Matrimonial.

24:04.477 --> 24:07.912
Knox and the privy council must
have promised him my throne.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.480
Which means they're not above
taking it by force.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.081
We must leave court
and get to safety, now.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.082
No.

24:12.084 --> 24:13.818
I must show strength.

24:13.820 --> 24:14.952
We can't risk you
coming to harm--

24:14.954 --> 24:17.555
I am the rightful
monarch of Scotland.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.956
You go.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.191
Collect those loyal to me

24:20.193 --> 24:21.559
and regroup somewhere
defensible.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.227
I could go to Dunbar.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.829
I have friends there,

24:24.831 --> 24:26.030
unwavering royalists.

24:26.032 --> 24:28.566
Your Majesty, Bothwell...

24:28.568 --> 24:30.534
Darnley and Lord Ruthven
are headed this way.

24:30.536 --> 24:31.669
Are you certain it was him?

24:31.671 --> 24:33.204
It was Lord Bothwell,
I swear.

24:33.206 --> 24:34.505
He entered
the queen's chambers?

24:34.507 --> 24:35.973
I saw it with my own eyes.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.709
You have to leave now.
I'll send word when I can.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.511
Muster our forces and prepare
to storm the castle.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.948
I'll wait in Dunbar.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.950
David, what are you doing?
You need to go, too.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.853
No. Whatever they try,
I'll be your witness.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.121
There's no more time. Go.

24:51.123 --> 24:55.159
Whatever happens, I'll
always be on your side.

24:57.597 --> 25:00.197
You're the queen.
They can't change that.

25:01.834 --> 25:03.133
Remember, we need Bothwell
for this to work.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.635
Do not let him escape.

25:06.572 --> 25:09.607
Where is Bothwell? Huh?
Show yourself, coward!

25:09.609 --> 25:11.075
Is that your plan?

25:11.077 --> 25:13.677
To accuse me of
adultery with Bothwell?

25:15.748 --> 25:17.548
Did you warn him?

25:17.550 --> 25:19.817
Let him slither out of here
like the snake that he is?

25:19.819 --> 25:22.820
The queen and I have been
alone here for the past hour.

25:22.822 --> 25:24.955
I have no idea
where Bothwell is.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.290
Like I told you,
I have remained

25:26.292 --> 25:28.826
faithful to our vows.
I am innocent.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.629
No, you're not, and we're
here to bring you to justice.

25:31.631 --> 25:33.898
How dare you barge in here

25:33.900 --> 25:35.766
with an empty claim.

25:35.768 --> 25:37.668
If you stand down now,

25:37.670 --> 25:40.905
I am willing to pardon
all of you for this treason,

25:40.907 --> 25:44.708
the punishment
for which is death.

25:49.849 --> 25:52.082
Do you want her off
the throne or not?

25:52.084 --> 25:53.183
Are you blind?

25:53.185 --> 25:55.553
Without Bothwell,
we have no proof.

25:55.555 --> 25:56.587
We have found the queen alone

25:56.589 --> 25:59.056
in her chambers with a man.

25:59.058 --> 26:01.859
The Italian will
serve our purpose.

26:01.861 --> 26:03.694
No one will believe you,
and you know why.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.930
What's he talking about?
Lies, no doubt.
What's it matter?

26:05.932 --> 26:07.998
This is our opportunity
to rid ourselves

26:08.000 --> 26:10.134
of this French imposter,

26:10.136 --> 26:12.303
this whore of a queen,
like we've wanted.

26:12.305 --> 26:14.138
There can be no backing down.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.141
We kill the Italian,

26:17.143 --> 26:19.944
but we do this together.
No one person to blame.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.879
You can't let them murder
an innocent man!

26:21.881 --> 26:23.781
Ruthven, this was
never the plan.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.082
This is not the time
for fear or weakness.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.350
Tonight we make history.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.352
Tonight we take back Scotland

26:28.354 --> 26:29.753
from the woman
who stole the throne.

26:29.755 --> 26:33.591
This is my final warning.
Stand down.

26:33.593 --> 26:34.825
Stand up, I say,
to her tyranny.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.962
We've come too far
now to back down.

26:37.964 --> 26:39.730
We must act as one
for Scotland.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.332
Please.
(shouts)

26:41.334 --> 26:43.801
MARY:
No! David!

26:44.637 --> 26:48.305
(crying): No. No. No.

26:48.307 --> 26:50.007
Are we in this together
or aren't we?

26:50.009 --> 26:52.142
No! No!

26:52.144 --> 26:53.644
You can't just let
them murder him!

26:53.646 --> 26:55.946
For Scotland!
MARY: No!

26:55.948 --> 26:58.082
(Rizzio and Mary shout)

26:58.084 --> 26:59.683
No!
For Scotland!

26:59.685 --> 27:01.352
(grunts)
MARY: No!

27:01.354 --> 27:02.353
No!

27:02.355 --> 27:03.921
(groans)

27:03.923 --> 27:06.323
(crying):
David! No!

27:07.727 --> 27:08.792
No!

27:08.794 --> 27:12.863
No! No!
David!

27:12.865 --> 27:14.765
No!

27:18.270 --> 27:20.170
(crying):
Let me go.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.006
No.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.307
No! No!

27:23.309 --> 27:26.276
Let me go!

27:26.278 --> 27:29.813
No! No!

27:31.283 --> 27:34.318
(Mary crying)

27:37.390 --> 27:40.691
(crying):
What have you done?

27:48.968 --> 27:50.968
Is this really necessary?

27:50.970 --> 27:53.237
I don't need to see
Narcisse's reaction to my gift

27:53.239 --> 27:55.406
to prove that he loves me.

27:55.408 --> 27:57.241
Then you have nothing
to worry about.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.309
They're coming.

28:00.246 --> 28:02.046
Get behind the screen.

28:03.983 --> 28:05.949
I haven't yet heard back
from Gideon,

28:05.951 --> 28:07.751
but I'm certain that I
have sent him on a course

28:07.753 --> 28:08.752
that will deliver us

28:08.754 --> 28:11.255
each what we desire.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.390
Oh.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.261
(Catherine chuckles)

28:19.031 --> 28:21.231
CATHERINE: "So that I may stay
close to your beating heart,

28:21.233 --> 28:22.466
always. Nicole."

28:22.468 --> 28:24.468
(laughing):
Isn't that adorable?

28:24.470 --> 28:26.904
Oh, joy, she's
found a new way

28:26.906 --> 28:28.038
to suffocate me.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.840
Now I'm expected
to carry this

28:29.842 --> 28:31.241
vile, little locket.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.143
She's so tedious,

28:33.145 --> 28:34.778
feigning affection
while feeling nothing.

28:34.780 --> 28:37.081
If it weren't for the effect
she has over Charles,

28:37.083 --> 28:39.850
this would be more
work than it is worth.

28:39.852 --> 28:40.884
I find that hard to believe.

28:40.886 --> 28:43.353
Hmm?
This comes easily to you.

28:43.355 --> 28:45.222
I've seen it.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.891
No, experienced it myself.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.793
Yes, but at least,

28:49.795 --> 28:52.329
in your case,
we were equally matched.

28:54.066 --> 28:55.132
CATHERINE:
Look at us.

28:55.134 --> 28:56.734
After all
we've been through,

28:56.736 --> 28:58.135
all we've lost,

28:58.137 --> 29:01.138
the two of us,
we're still here.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.273
Keeping the kingdom
from falling apart.

29:03.275 --> 29:06.043
Oh, together,

29:06.045 --> 29:09.179
we really are a force
to be reckoned with.

29:09.181 --> 29:13.016
When I told you
to get over the loss of Lola,

29:13.018 --> 29:16.754
I didn't mean for you to sleep
with every woman in the castle,

29:16.756 --> 29:19.189
which is what I hear
you've been doing.

29:19.191 --> 29:22.326
And does that...
bother you?

29:22.328 --> 29:24.194
CATHERINE:
I was controlling.

29:24.196 --> 29:25.763
Yeah.

29:25.765 --> 29:28.165
Not cloying.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.300
And never once dull.
Never.

29:30.302 --> 29:34.204
So, no, this time,
it doesn't bother me.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.140
Ah.

29:36.142 --> 29:37.941
This time?

29:37.943 --> 29:40.144
I do like the sound of that.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.288
(muffled crying)

29:59.198 --> 30:00.364
RUTHVEN:
<i> For Scotland!</i>

30:00.366 --> 30:02.266
MARY:
No! No! David!

30:11.210 --> 30:14.311
(groans)

30:14.313 --> 30:15.379
I think there's something
wrong with the baby.

30:15.381 --> 30:17.848
I need my husband.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.116
I am under strict orders

30:19.118 --> 30:20.250
not to leave you unguarded.

30:20.252 --> 30:21.819
This is your king's child.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.855
Go!
(groans)

30:24.857 --> 30:27.157
(exhales)

30:29.962 --> 30:31.862
Mary.

30:31.864 --> 30:32.996
Your Majesty.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.231
(door closes)

30:34.233 --> 30:35.833
Are you all right?

30:35.835 --> 30:38.468
Is the baby...?

30:38.470 --> 30:40.537
I'll summon for a
physician right away.

30:40.539 --> 30:41.972
No, the baby is fine.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.106
I needed to talk
to you in private.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.274
Knox is using you.

30:44.276 --> 30:45.209
Mary, it's over.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.877
The coup was a success!

30:46.879 --> 30:47.978
You have to accept your fate.

30:47.980 --> 30:49.146
And what about your fate?

30:49.148 --> 30:50.614
Who is in power now, hmm?

30:50.616 --> 30:53.083
You or the privy council?
It's only temporary.

30:53.085 --> 30:54.551
It all happened so fast, they
said it would take time, but...

30:54.553 --> 30:56.119
What did Knox promise you?

30:56.121 --> 30:58.021
That while I rotted
in jail for an affair

30:58.023 --> 31:00.023
that never happened, that
they would make you king?

31:00.025 --> 31:02.893
You, an Englishman,
a Catholic?

31:02.895 --> 31:05.429
I'll convert, and then I'll take
the English throne, too.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.130
Don't be a fool.

31:07.132 --> 31:08.398
We are married because

31:08.400 --> 31:10.367
I couldn't take
England without you.

31:10.369 --> 31:13.937
What makes you think that you
can take England without me?

31:13.939 --> 31:15.572
Knox may despise me,

31:15.574 --> 31:18.442
but he hates the idea
of a monarchy even more.

31:18.444 --> 31:20.244
You will never be safe.

31:20.246 --> 31:23.113
Well, I-I...
They killed Rizzio.

31:23.115 --> 31:26.083
They will turn on you,
as easily

31:26.085 --> 31:27.451
as they turned
on me, as easily

31:27.453 --> 31:29.319
as they turned to murder.

31:29.321 --> 31:30.487
I never intended
for Rizzio to die.

31:30.489 --> 31:32.222
All I wanted

31:32.224 --> 31:34.358
was to catch you with Bothwell.

31:34.360 --> 31:37.961
There was nothing to catch.
I have been faithful to you.

31:37.963 --> 31:39.596
Darnley.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.266
They will kill you.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.603
What am I to do?

31:46.605 --> 31:48.538
Help me escape the castle.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.673
No.
Help me,

31:49.675 --> 31:51.675
and we will get back
all that is ours,

31:51.677 --> 31:53.610
as king and queen together.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.380
Or stay...

31:56.382 --> 32:00.150
and be cast off by
those who have used you.

32:03.222 --> 32:05.022
NICOLE:
<i>How could I have been so naive?</i>

32:05.024 --> 32:07.357
All this time,
I gave myself to him.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.526
How can I erase those sounds,
seared into my brain?

32:09.528 --> 32:11.228
You didn't know
they were lovers?
Lord, no.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.096
I knew Narcisse
didn't care about you,

32:13.098 --> 32:14.598
but had no idea about them.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.666
(cries)

32:15.668 --> 32:16.967
Oh.

32:16.969 --> 32:18.602
There, there, Nicole.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.170
I truly am sorry.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.705
I just felt that you
deserved the truth.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.440
You deserve someone
that cares for you,

32:23.442 --> 32:25.275
and I don't mean
a weak, boy king.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.211
I mean me.

32:28.213 --> 32:29.546
You don't care about me.

32:29.548 --> 32:30.948
I do.
No.

32:30.950 --> 32:33.116
My God, look at you.
How could I not?

32:33.118 --> 32:35.585
Narcisse is a fool,
an utter fool,

32:35.587 --> 32:37.387
and someday,
when you're with the right man,

32:37.389 --> 32:39.423
someone he knows
he's truly lost you to,

32:39.425 --> 32:41.224
he will realize that.

32:51.003 --> 32:52.269
(man grunts)

32:53.372 --> 32:55.305
I have a trusted servant

32:55.307 --> 32:57.708
waiting south of the castle
with horses.

32:58.677 --> 33:00.077
If we're going to escape,

33:00.079 --> 33:01.611
we have to do it now.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.413
I can walk on my own.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.785
and in your condition...

34:14.787 --> 34:18.722
Dunbar is close.
Bothwell will be waiting.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.724
Without us, the conspirators
have no leverage.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.528
We must strike now,
while they are weak.

34:27.099 --> 34:29.066
Mary.

34:30.269 --> 34:31.368
I'm so sorry.

34:31.370 --> 34:34.571
Rizzio didn't deserve
to die like that.

34:34.573 --> 34:36.339
No, he didn't.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.208
You will get justice for him,

34:38.210 --> 34:40.577
but if I come with you,
I know that Bothwell will say

34:40.579 --> 34:42.379
that that justice
means my death.

34:42.381 --> 34:45.215
All I've ever wanted
was to be treated with respect.

34:45.217 --> 34:49.286
I don't want to die.

34:53.225 --> 34:54.758
Darnley, don't leave.
Come with me.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.227
It's my only chance at survival.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.462
Where will you go?

34:58.464 --> 34:59.763
Somewhere where
I won't be found.

34:59.765 --> 35:02.732
Darnley, no.
Take care, you and the baby.

35:14.313 --> 35:16.680
(both lightly chuckle)

35:16.682 --> 35:18.415
I can't stop staring at you.

35:18.417 --> 35:21.284
I am smitten.

35:21.286 --> 35:24.554
And I thought after last
night, our intimacy,

35:24.556 --> 35:27.190
it's time to make
things official.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.400
It's beautiful.

35:37.402 --> 35:39.903
However, there is one
thing we must discuss

35:39.905 --> 35:41.238
before moving forward.

35:43.275 --> 35:46.643
I want our relationship to be
built on trust and honesty.

35:46.645 --> 35:50.180
Of course.
As do I.

35:50.182 --> 35:54.384
I know that those words you
wrote were not meant for me.

35:55.320 --> 35:56.920
I'm guessing
they were written

35:56.922 --> 35:57.921
for Gideon Blackburn.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.589
I've observed you together.

35:59.591 --> 36:03.460
You are... different
when he is near.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.828
Lighter.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.163
That's not true.

36:06.165 --> 36:07.464
I don't believe you.

36:07.466 --> 36:09.799
If you are so sure
of my feelings for him,

36:09.801 --> 36:12.335
then you tricked me
into sleeping with you.

36:12.337 --> 36:14.204
Because I had to show you
what we could be together.

36:14.206 --> 36:15.205
What am I?

36:15.207 --> 36:16.540
A fool.

36:16.542 --> 36:17.908
No, you're not.

36:17.910 --> 36:21.878
You're brilliant,
and you're gorgeous,

36:21.880 --> 36:24.881
and you're willing
to marry me for your country.

36:24.883 --> 36:27.617
But that's not enough
for me.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.553
Because your attention

36:29.555 --> 36:31.788
has been elsewhere, and oddly

36:31.790 --> 36:33.623
because you need this marriage,

36:33.625 --> 36:35.292
you weren't giving me a chance.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.661
To show me who you are.

36:37.663 --> 36:39.429
I think I know now.

36:40.499 --> 36:41.798
I'm the man who held you

36:41.800 --> 36:42.899
in his arms for hours,

36:42.901 --> 36:45.802
but I did not force you,

36:45.804 --> 36:48.939
and I don't believe you forced
your response to me last night.

36:48.941 --> 36:52.776
Did you?
Be honest with me.

36:52.778 --> 36:56.313
It's all right
to enjoy sex, Elizabeth,

36:56.315 --> 36:58.381
especially with one's husband,

36:58.383 --> 37:00.951
which is what
I still want to be.

37:00.953 --> 37:04.254
Even knowing I have feelings
for another?

37:04.256 --> 37:06.556
I believe you
could have feelings for me,

37:06.558 --> 37:08.325
stronger feelings.

37:08.327 --> 37:11.461
But the truth is we both
need this marriage to work.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.996
Me, to shore up
my country's finances.

37:12.998 --> 37:14.731
And you,
to gain Catholic support

37:14.733 --> 37:16.600
to counter Mary's aggression.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.803
If we wed, you need
never fear her again,

37:19.805 --> 37:23.773
and together,
we would be unstoppable.

37:23.775 --> 37:26.710
But you must stop
whatever is happening

37:26.712 --> 37:28.245
between you
and Gideon Blackburn.

37:31.950 --> 37:33.516
I will.

37:33.518 --> 37:35.018
And you must remove him
from court.

37:35.020 --> 37:38.321
I don't want to see
him here again.

37:38.323 --> 37:39.789
Those are my terms.

37:39.791 --> 37:41.658
They are not negotiable.

37:44.630 --> 37:46.429
All right.

37:48.967 --> 37:51.001
I will send him away.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.379
My congratulations,
Lord Blackburn,

38:02.381 --> 38:04.381
on your brilliant
diplomacy.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.883
You have achieved everything
you set out to do.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.753
Your queen has returned her
ships and valuable cargo,

38:09.755 --> 38:12.322
and the English
residents of Granville

38:12.324 --> 38:14.457
no longer need
fear reprisals.

38:14.459 --> 38:16.726
Thanks to you,
Lord Narcisse, it's...

38:16.728 --> 38:19.362
it's all worked out well.

38:21.466 --> 38:23.733
I have to ask.

38:23.735 --> 38:26.036
Why did you guide me?
I thought it might be nice

38:26.038 --> 38:28.038
if we both claim a victory.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.839
You, for your queen.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.608
Me, to ensure that France

38:31.610 --> 38:33.343
remains independent from Spain.

38:33.345 --> 38:35.879
You're an exemplary statesman.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.881
Mm.
Setting aside
your personal feelings

38:37.883 --> 38:39.749
for the good
of your country.

38:39.751 --> 38:42.385
Lola would be proud of you.

38:42.387 --> 38:46.456
Well, it's time to bury
the past, move on.

38:48.660 --> 38:52.896
I wish you a safe journey
back to your queen, Gideon.

38:52.898 --> 38:54.631
I hope she shows
great appreciation

38:54.633 --> 38:56.533
for what you achieved here.

38:56.535 --> 38:57.967
Hm.

39:00.539 --> 39:02.605
♪ ♪

39:04.543 --> 39:06.543
(footsteps approaching)

39:06.545 --> 39:08.678
You sent for me, brother?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.914
On this throne,
I'm your king.

39:10.916 --> 39:13.049
You'd do well
to remember that.

39:13.051 --> 39:15.785
I stand chastened, Your Majesty.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.520
But why?
(chuckles)

39:17.522 --> 39:19.923
Be grateful you're
still standing at all.

39:24.062 --> 39:26.396
I know what you've been up to.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.500
I unraveled your little plot

39:30.502 --> 39:32.969
pitting England and France
against each other

39:32.971 --> 39:35.038
strengthening your
friends in Spain.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.039
I'm not sure--

39:36.041 --> 39:37.640
Don't try to deny it!

39:37.642 --> 39:39.142
You'd plunge France

39:39.144 --> 39:41.778
into war to sate
your lust for my crown,

39:41.780 --> 39:43.146
but you have failed.

39:43.148 --> 39:44.981
You will never have

39:44.983 --> 39:48.385
what belongs to me--
is that clear?

39:51.656 --> 39:54.057
As crystal...

39:54.059 --> 39:56.159
Your Majesty.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.938
With your forces, we should have
enough men to retaliate.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.174
We'll continue
to recruit troops overnight.

40:11.176 --> 40:13.610
If we don't hear from Queen Mary
by the morning,

40:13.612 --> 40:14.878
we'll attack.
MARY:
Lord Bothwell.

40:14.880 --> 40:16.713
(pants)
(men clamoring)

40:17.816 --> 40:19.416
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

40:19.418 --> 40:20.183
You're here. What happened?

40:20.185 --> 40:21.184
I convinced Darnley

40:21.186 --> 40:22.585
to help me escape.

40:22.587 --> 40:24.487
He feared for his life--
rightly so--

40:24.489 --> 40:25.889
and went his own way.

40:25.891 --> 40:27.924
The castle is still in the hands
of the conspirators.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.058
What of Rizzio?

40:30.729 --> 40:32.629
They wanted

40:32.631 --> 40:36.933
to accuse me of adultery,
and when they didn't find you...

40:36.935 --> 40:39.102
they butchered David.

40:41.206 --> 40:43.473
He was a good man.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.709
(sighs)

40:46.711 --> 40:50.947
Your loyalty to the Crown in
this time will not be forgotten.

40:50.949 --> 40:54.717
Your sovereign queen
has been betrayed,

40:54.719 --> 40:57.454
in an unforgivable way.

40:57.456 --> 41:00.223
But the conspirators
will not live long enough

41:00.225 --> 41:02.826
to gloat about their treachery.

41:04.463 --> 41:08.064
At dawn,
we will take back the castle,

41:08.066 --> 41:10.867
and the traitors will pay
for what they have done

41:10.869 --> 41:11.935
with their lives!

41:14.840 --> 41:16.906
