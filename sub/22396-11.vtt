00:03.832 --> 00:05.291
This is the life, huh, boys?

00:05.291 --> 00:07.874
The three of us lovingly nestled

00:07.874 --> 00:12.249
in mother nature's glorious bosom.

00:12.249 --> 00:13.416
Yeah, that's great.

00:13.416 --> 00:15.541
Now where do I plug this in?

00:15.541 --> 00:17.374
Ooh! And this!

00:17.374 --> 00:20.000
I need my toast, Mick.
I gotta have it.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.166
What? There's
no electricity out here.

00:22.166 --> 00:23.416
We're camping!

00:23.416 --> 00:25.582
Uh huh.
Excuse me.

00:35.582 --> 00:37.957
Now this is camping!

00:37.957 --> 00:40.333
Donald, that thing is obscene!

00:40.333 --> 00:42.707
And we won't stand for it, right, goofy?

00:45.749 --> 00:47.957
Sorry, Mick.
I need my toast.

00:49.915 --> 00:51.291
Well, fine!

00:51.291 --> 00:53.041
But I'm roughin' it!

00:56.457 --> 00:59.374
Dang, Donny, this is nice!

01:04.166 --> 01:07.124
And look at all these fancy doodads.

01:10.541 --> 01:11.624
Hey!

01:11.624 --> 01:13.166
You can't throw garbage in the woods!

01:13.166 --> 01:15.582
It attracts wild...

01:32.624 --> 01:33.624
Oh!

01:35.541 --> 01:36.541
Yahoo!

01:43.000 --> 01:44.000
Whoo-hoo!

01:56.957 --> 01:59.249
Whoo! Yeah!
That's the stuff!

01:59.249 --> 02:00.457
Give it to me, man!

02:00.457 --> 02:01.582
Whoo!

02:05.832 --> 02:06.915
Hey!

02:07.374 --> 02:08.249
Ha, ha, ha!

02:08.915 --> 02:10.790
You're ruining camping!

02:10.790 --> 02:13.499
Ah, this isn't camping!

02:13.499 --> 02:15.291
Yes it is!

02:20.208 --> 02:21.208
You hippie.

02:36.666 --> 02:38.000
Help us!

02:39.249 --> 02:40.666
Jiminy timbers!

03:02.041 --> 03:04.083
- Fellas!
- Mickey!

03:06.333 --> 03:07.333
Jump!

03:16.915 --> 03:18.291
Thank you, Mickey.

03:18.291 --> 03:21.166
Yeah, from now on, we're
gonna do things your way.

03:21.166 --> 03:22.416
We're roughin' it.

03:22.416 --> 03:24.374
You guys can do whatever you want.

03:26.624 --> 03:28.374
I'm checking into a hotel.
