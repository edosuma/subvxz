WEBVTT

00:03.062 --> 00:04.712
(exhales)

00:06.490 --> 00:09.249
Okay, babe, first candidate
should be here any minute.

00:09.251 --> 00:10.325
Is the coffee ready?

00:10.327 --> 00:11.993
The tea kettle is charged.

00:11.995 --> 00:13.661
English breakfast, herbal tea,

00:13.663 --> 00:17.499
green tea, decaf,
and (clicks tongue) regular.

00:17.501 --> 00:19.259
Hey, are we sure
these pretzel sticks are vegan?

00:19.261 --> 00:21.169
I think so.
Is one of the candidates vegan?

00:21.171 --> 00:23.022
Well, with the priestess,
I have to assume.

00:23.024 --> 00:25.599
I don't wanna
offend her, you know.

00:25.601 --> 00:27.601
I'm worried you're putting
too much pressure on this.

00:27.603 --> 00:28.935
Uh...

00:28.937 --> 00:30.011
No, I am not.

00:30.589 --> 00:33.866
This officiant is gonna
unite us in front of God

00:33.868 --> 00:34.867
for the rest of our lives.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.684
I mean, it is a big deal.

00:36.686 --> 00:39.371
Okay.
Yeah, but the right person
will find us.

00:40.099 --> 00:41.689
You just have to be yourself
and not worry.

00:41.691 --> 00:43.024
And if she doesn't
want a pretzel stick,

00:43.026 --> 00:44.293
she won't eat it.

00:45.362 --> 00:46.453
Because you think
they're not vegan.

00:46.455 --> 00:48.363
I knew it.
It's a stupid idea.

00:48.365 --> 00:49.697
I'm gonna throw these out.

00:49.699 --> 00:50.624
Hey.

00:51.034 --> 00:52.200
-Look at me.
-(TK sighs)

00:52.202 --> 00:54.702
This is supposed
to be fun, alright?

00:54.704 --> 00:56.263
Everything will be okay.

00:56.949 --> 00:58.390
Okay.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.374
Let's have some fun.

00:59.376 --> 01:01.393
<i> Mazel tov</i>
on the engagement.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.304
Rabbi Finkel,
thank you for coming.

01:04.306 --> 01:05.213
Of course.

01:05.457 --> 01:07.624
So should we call you
Pastor Savard

01:07.626 --> 01:08.475
or Pastor Nicole?

01:08.477 --> 01:09.476
Oh, Nicole's fine.

01:09.628 --> 01:11.737
Amethyst, or goddess,
if you prefer.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.147
It's very nice
to meet you, Amethyst.

01:14.149 --> 01:15.148
CARLOS REYES:
Can we call you Tom?

01:15.150 --> 01:16.742
Uh, Reverend Tom,
if you don't mind.

01:16.744 --> 01:21.138
I didn't go to divinity school
for seven years to be just Tom.

01:21.140 --> 01:25.992
If I may say, you two
both have radiant auras.

01:25.994 --> 01:27.902
-Why, thank you.
-AMETHYST: I've always been

01:27.904 --> 01:28.979
blessed with second sight.

01:28.981 --> 01:30.589
Are those pretzel sticks?

01:30.591 --> 01:31.632
Yeah.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.822
(crunching)

01:39.583 --> 01:43.084
Are-are you sure you're okay
with officiating a wedding for,

01:43.086 --> 01:44.085
you know, folks like us?

01:44.087 --> 01:46.663
Who's to say
a nice young Jewish boy

01:46.665 --> 01:51.259
couldn't find love with
a handsome Catholic?

01:51.261 --> 01:52.611
We're a Side A church.

01:52.613 --> 01:55.930
That means that we believe
all loving relationships

01:55.932 --> 01:57.765
are equal in the eyes of God.

01:57.767 --> 01:58.892
That's really beautiful.

01:58.894 --> 02:01.345
I brought you
a few scripture passages

02:01.347 --> 02:04.331
on the subject that I think
would be great for you to read.

02:05.184 --> 02:06.350
CARLOS: Hmm.

02:06.352 --> 02:11.130
Yours is a cool blue
of a sage.

02:11.132 --> 02:13.857
Yours is a fiery,
passionate red.

02:13.859 --> 02:15.359
And when you come together,

02:15.361 --> 02:18.862
your couple aura
turns into a prismatic...

02:18.864 --> 02:19.972
Purple?

02:19.974 --> 02:21.214
Do you have the sight, too?

02:21.216 --> 02:24.292
No, I'm just familiar
with the color wheel.

02:24.294 --> 02:27.053
The passage I recommend
for same-sex unions is

02:27.055 --> 02:29.982
<i> "Ani L'Dodi V'Dodi Li."</i>

02:29.984 --> 02:31.299
I am my beloved's--

02:31.301 --> 02:34.211
-And my beloved is mine.
-RABBI FINKEL: Yes.

02:34.213 --> 02:36.471
I guess something stuck
from Hebrew school.

02:36.473 --> 02:37.397
(chuckles)

02:37.491 --> 02:39.049
And people don't always
like to hear it.

02:39.051 --> 02:41.160
But sometimes love isn't enough.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.145
Marriage is the greatest
commitment you'll ever make.

02:44.147 --> 02:46.165
Especially for you boys.

02:46.167 --> 02:48.725
You'll be joined together
for eternity.

02:48.727 --> 02:50.151
Burning in hell.

02:50.153 --> 02:51.561
-Wow.
-Hmm.

02:51.563 --> 02:53.413
-TK STRAND: Thanks for
the heads up, Tom.
-Yep.

02:53.415 --> 02:56.008
-If I may offer
a piece of advice?
-Yeah.

02:56.010 --> 02:57.492
Don't listen to the noise.

02:57.494 --> 03:00.012
And believe me,
there will be a lot of noise.

03:00.014 --> 03:02.014
Ho, ho, ho. Ha, ha, ha.

03:02.016 --> 03:04.165
He, he, he. Me, me, me.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.926
Dee, dee.
He, he, he.

03:05.928 --> 03:09.079
Me, me, me.
Thee, thee, thee.

03:09.081 --> 03:10.430
You available on the 26th?

03:10.432 --> 03:14.084
I don't believe in
the Christian calendar.
Or time.

03:14.086 --> 03:16.862
So all that's left to do now
is to enroll you

03:16.864 --> 03:17.938
in some classes.

03:17.940 --> 03:20.348
-Some classes?
-To convert, of course.

03:20.350 --> 03:22.517
PASTOR NICOLE:
I don't like to force anything
on anyone,

03:22.519 --> 03:25.262
but I always ask
my couples to have

03:25.264 --> 03:28.098
the big, difficult
conversations now

03:28.100 --> 03:29.208
before you get married.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.451
About work, finances, romance.

03:31.453 --> 03:34.529
Oh, trust me, we've had all
of the difficult conversations.

03:34.531 --> 03:35.772
And what about kids?

03:36.217 --> 03:38.550
-CARLOS:
We're not gonna have kids.
-TK: Can't wait to have them.

03:40.612 --> 03:41.470
What?

03:42.130 --> 03:45.057
(theme music plays)

03:45.059 --> 03:46.466
CARLOS:
So who's your leading contender?

03:47.228 --> 03:49.427
I'll be honest,
Amethyst had my vote

03:49.429 --> 03:52.272
right up until the moment
she said I had a blue aura.

03:53.976 --> 03:55.567
Everybody knows
it's emerald green.

03:56.628 --> 03:59.053
Are we seriously not gonna
talk about this, Carlos?

03:59.055 --> 04:00.630
CARLOS:
Talk about what?

04:00.632 --> 04:03.817
The gaping chasm
that just opened up between us?

04:03.819 --> 04:05.802
There's no gaping chasm.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.305
Carlos, since when do you
not wanna have kids?

04:08.307 --> 04:10.398
Since when did I ever say I did?

04:10.400 --> 04:12.476
I don't know,
I-I guess I just assumed.

04:12.478 --> 04:14.811
You also assumed
I didn't have a wife.

04:14.813 --> 04:16.070
You're so funny.

04:16.072 --> 04:17.422
How have we never had
this conversation?

04:17.424 --> 04:19.758
I don't know. It's not something
I've been thinking about.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.076
Plus, we've been busy working,

04:22.078 --> 04:23.095
trying to have a little fun

04:23.097 --> 04:26.172
when we're not in comas
or being abducted.

04:26.174 --> 04:28.267
Yeah, but you...
you love kids, Carlos.

04:28.269 --> 04:30.102
I love other people's kids.

04:30.104 --> 04:33.330
Okay. What about
your nephews and nieces

04:33.332 --> 04:36.166
or-or Captain Vega's twins
or baby Charlie?

04:36.168 --> 04:38.018
All other people's kids.

04:38.020 --> 04:39.611
Yeah, but you're
so great with them.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.854
Thank you.

04:40.856 --> 04:42.022
I'm also great with horses.

04:42.024 --> 04:43.323
Something else
you probably didn't know.

04:44.601 --> 04:46.860
TK, I just want us
to have a chance to be us.

04:47.679 --> 04:48.936
There are so many things
I still wanna do with you.

04:48.938 --> 04:50.271
I wanna hike
the Great Wall with you.

04:50.273 --> 04:52.682
I wanna sleep in
in Tuscany with you.
I wanna--

04:52.684 --> 04:55.460
Babe, you don't even hike here,
and you hate sleeping in.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.354
Yeah. We've still never been
to New York together.

04:57.356 --> 04:58.705
Well, you know
that they allow you

04:58.707 --> 05:00.023
to bring children
into New York?

05:00.225 --> 05:02.192
I just don't think we're
anywhere close to being ready

05:02.194 --> 05:04.044
for that level
of responsibility.

05:04.363 --> 05:06.029
We've never even had a pet.

05:06.031 --> 05:07.864
Lou.

05:07.866 --> 05:08.974
-Lou?
-TK: Lou.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.200
Our pet lizard.

05:10.202 --> 05:11.476
The lizard that escaped
five minutes

05:11.478 --> 05:13.053
after you brought it
to the house

05:13.055 --> 05:14.371
and that we've released
back into the wild?

05:14.648 --> 05:16.964
So you think I'm gonna
make a terrible father.

05:16.966 --> 05:18.224
I never said that.

05:18.226 --> 05:19.609
Mm-hmm.

05:21.229 --> 05:24.197
But what I do think...

05:27.477 --> 05:32.998
is that you are going to make
a fantastic husband.

05:43.326 --> 05:45.326
V8 engine designed in Modena

05:45.328 --> 05:47.237
with a Milanese
leather interior.

05:47.239 --> 05:48.922
The seats are heated.

05:48.924 --> 05:49.997
And to answer your question,

05:49.999 --> 05:52.300
yes, the pastries
are complimentary.

05:52.302 --> 05:54.928
(chuckles)
Oh, it's awfully fancy, Mitch.

05:54.930 --> 05:58.023
I mean, do we need
something so fancy?

05:58.025 --> 05:59.599
After what we've been through?

05:59.860 --> 06:01.342
The universe owes it to us.

06:02.421 --> 06:05.864
We were unhoused
when an act of God
destroyed our marital abode.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.181
Oh, no. Fire?

06:07.183 --> 06:08.867
Fire department, actually.

06:08.869 --> 06:09.868
We lost everything.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.186
Luckily, my uncle
passed recently.

06:12.188 --> 06:13.430
Left us his duplex.

06:13.432 --> 06:15.523
Well, that's... good.

06:16.043 --> 06:18.192
And we have
a little money put away.

06:18.194 --> 06:20.361
Almost half a million dollars.

06:20.363 --> 06:23.197
We started a GoFundMe
after the tragedy

06:23.199 --> 06:26.367
to see how generous
people can be to those in need.

06:26.369 --> 06:28.128
It restored
our faith in humanity.

06:28.130 --> 06:30.037
(singsongy)
Now we flush.

06:30.039 --> 06:31.781
(all chuckling)

06:31.783 --> 06:33.600
So, what do you say?

06:34.970 --> 06:36.561
I don't know.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.480
(slight chuckle)

06:39.975 --> 06:41.983
-Let's get, uh, more of these.
-I gotcha.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.738
I mean, people
donated that money

06:46.740 --> 06:48.815
so we could afford a new home,

06:48.817 --> 06:49.983
but we have that now.

06:49.985 --> 06:51.134
Shouldn't we give it back?

06:51.136 --> 06:53.394
Lila, when people donate
to a worthy cause,

06:53.396 --> 06:55.229
they do it so they feel good.

06:55.565 --> 06:57.791
Do you wanna take that feeling
away from them?

06:57.793 --> 07:00.252
Well, no, but it just...

07:00.662 --> 07:03.088
feels so extravagant.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.257
See, that's what you call
a poverty mindset,

07:05.259 --> 07:07.074
and you have to get over that.

07:07.076 --> 07:08.334
I know when you look
in the mirror,

07:08.336 --> 07:11.263
you see a plebe
from the trailer park.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.223
But you know what I see?

07:13.992 --> 07:15.100
What?

07:15.510 --> 07:16.326
A queen.

07:16.328 --> 07:18.603
A queen whose butt belongs

07:18.605 --> 07:20.939
-on heated Milanese leather.
-(Lila squeals)

07:20.941 --> 07:22.348
(both chuckle)

07:22.851 --> 07:25.259
That doesn't sound terrible.

07:25.261 --> 07:26.427
MITCH (chuckling): Yeah.

07:26.429 --> 07:28.171
You don't have to feel guilty

07:28.173 --> 07:30.674
about getting
what you deserve, Lila.

07:30.676 --> 07:31.992
So what do you say?

07:32.861 --> 07:34.694
♪♪

07:34.696 --> 07:36.938
Oh... We'll take it!

07:37.199 --> 07:39.583
-(Lila whooping)
-(engine roaring)

07:43.205 --> 07:45.112
(whooping continues)

07:45.114 --> 07:48.358
My heart is pumping
outta my chest!

07:48.360 --> 07:50.952
-That's the V8.
-Whoo-hoo!

07:51.138 --> 07:53.863
Oh, yes! Whoo!

07:53.865 --> 07:55.599
(whooping continues)

07:57.536 --> 07:58.477
Whoo!

07:59.796 --> 08:00.979
Oh. Ohh! Hey!

08:00.981 --> 08:03.873
Mitch, Mitch.
That guy is trying to race us.

08:03.875 --> 08:05.208
Let's do it.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.392
I-I don't know, hon.

08:06.394 --> 08:09.562
Oh, come on. Look at him.
Come on. Come on.

08:09.564 --> 08:10.655
Come on!

08:10.974 --> 08:12.565
Speed up! Speed up!

08:12.567 --> 08:15.068
You're lettin' that
trash bag pass us!

08:15.070 --> 08:18.997
Whoo! Don't think,
just go, baby!

08:18.999 --> 08:20.457
(exhales)

08:21.668 --> 08:23.502
(engine roaring)

08:24.913 --> 08:25.962
(Lila whooping)

08:27.841 --> 08:30.342
(Lila and Mitch screaming)

08:31.327 --> 08:33.327
-Whoo!
-MITCH: Woo-hoo-hoo!

08:34.072 --> 08:36.163
(Lila and Mitch
whooping and screaming)

08:36.165 --> 08:38.332
Four hundred and fifty
horsepower!

08:38.334 --> 08:40.410
Suck it, plebe! Ha-ha!

08:40.687 --> 08:42.854
(cars zooming)

08:42.856 --> 08:45.915
All hail the queen, bitch!

08:45.917 --> 08:46.858
Whoo!

08:46.860 --> 08:48.251
God, I love you.

08:48.253 --> 08:50.103
I love you too, king.

08:50.105 --> 08:52.030
(both laughing)

08:52.032 --> 08:53.865
(Lila and Mitch scream)

08:53.867 --> 08:55.091
LILA:
Slow down, slow down!

08:55.093 --> 08:56.259
I'm trying!

08:56.261 --> 08:58.370
(tires screeching)

08:59.097 --> 09:01.081
(Lila gasps, pants)

09:01.875 --> 09:03.116
(truck beeping)

09:03.118 --> 09:05.544
(both screaming)

09:07.881 --> 09:09.214
LILA: No!

09:09.866 --> 09:11.466
(manure rumbling)

09:22.229 --> 09:25.622
(horns blaring, sirens wailing)

09:26.049 --> 09:27.307
OWEN STRAND:
What happened?

09:27.309 --> 09:30.569
Well, them two
nearly crashed their hot rod

09:30.571 --> 09:31.961
into my side dumper.

09:31.963 --> 09:33.129
Nearly crashed?

09:33.131 --> 09:34.814
MAN:
Well, yeah, they stopped short,

09:34.816 --> 09:36.132
but I was
in the middle of a dump.

09:36.134 --> 09:37.909
-Wait, all that's manure?
-Yep.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.560
High-quality organic.

09:39.562 --> 09:41.896
They ain't hurt none,
but they're, uh,

09:41.898 --> 09:43.064
kinda planted in there.

09:43.066 --> 09:44.899
Are you kidding me? Cap.

09:44.901 --> 09:45.900
Do you see who that is?

09:45.902 --> 09:47.477
Wait, why do they look familiar?

09:47.479 --> 09:49.646
NANCY GILLIAN:
They're that couple
from that runaway house.

09:49.648 --> 09:51.238
Wait, the ones who filed
the complaint against Marjan?

09:51.240 --> 09:53.149
-PAUL STRICKLAND: The same.
-MATEO CHAVEZ: Oh, yeah.

09:53.151 --> 09:55.985
Mr. and Mrs. Geralds,
as I live and... breathe.

09:56.488 --> 09:58.504
-Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.
-(Lila whimpers)

09:58.506 --> 10:00.432
-Are you hurt?
-No, we're not hurt.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.525
-We're just stuck.
-(Lila groaning)

10:02.527 --> 10:04.828
So stuck like,
stuck, stuck can't move?

10:04.830 --> 10:07.497
Well, do you think
we'd be sitting in here
if we could move?

10:07.499 --> 10:09.666
I don't know you well enough
to answer that question.

10:09.668 --> 10:12.093
Captain Vega, you wanna
assess the medical injuries?

10:12.095 --> 10:13.928
Will do. TK, get a pulse ox.

10:13.930 --> 10:15.021
Copy that, Cap.

10:15.282 --> 10:17.264
Hey, can I get
a ladder over here?

10:17.266 --> 10:19.192
(gags, coughs) Oh, God.

10:19.194 --> 10:21.194
Mitch, I swallowed some!

10:21.196 --> 10:23.496
Well try keeping
your mouth shut, Lila!

10:25.033 --> 10:27.125
(both groan)

10:27.127 --> 10:29.502
-(Lila grunts, sighs)
-Hey, guys.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.631
-LILA: Oh.
-(device beeping)

10:33.634 --> 10:34.633
(both groan)

10:34.635 --> 10:36.876
-It's cold.
-Satting at 96, Cap.

10:36.878 --> 10:38.619
Everything's alright.

10:38.621 --> 10:39.638
Alright.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.972
Stable for extraction.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.791
Captain Strand,
they're all yours.

10:43.793 --> 10:45.268
Yeah.

10:46.295 --> 10:47.479
(sighs)

10:47.873 --> 10:49.630
Huh.

10:49.632 --> 10:50.690
Hmm. Mm-mmm.

10:52.377 --> 10:55.044
-(Lila groaning)
-What? What "hmm"?

10:55.046 --> 10:56.062
Why are you
just standing there?

10:56.064 --> 10:57.063
I'm assessing.

10:57.065 --> 10:58.806
What is there to assess?

10:58.808 --> 11:00.049
Get us out of here!

11:00.051 --> 11:01.159
OWEN:
We don't wanna rush.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.218
Isn't that right, Marwani?

11:02.220 --> 11:03.978
Oh, that's right, Cap.

11:03.980 --> 11:04.996
There could be mistakes.

11:04.998 --> 11:05.997
Mistakes are bad.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.333
Oh, my God.
Just pull us out.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.592
OWEN:
We could just pull you out.

11:09.594 --> 11:11.652
Isn't that right, Judd?
We could pull 'em out.

11:11.654 --> 11:13.229
Well, I mean,
we could pull 'em out,

11:13.231 --> 11:14.822
but we'd probably just
pull their arms right off.

11:14.824 --> 11:15.656
-What?
-JUDD RYDER: Yeah.

11:15.658 --> 11:16.657
Cow manure weighs somewhere

11:16.902 --> 11:19.678
between 1,200 and 1,800
pounds per cubic yard,

11:19.680 --> 11:22.755
depending on how much, uh,
fiber's in the cows' diet.

11:22.757 --> 11:24.498
I think this one had a lot.

11:25.168 --> 11:27.185
Alright, let's get
some shovels in here.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.929
-Yes, Yes, shovels. Thank you.
-Yes, yes, yes.

11:29.931 --> 11:31.414
MITCH:
H-How long is this gonna take?

11:31.416 --> 11:34.100
Oh, not long.
Hour or two.

11:34.102 --> 11:37.862
No, I cannot breathe in this
for another hour.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.346
OWEN:
Well, I suppose
we could fit you

11:39.348 --> 11:41.182
with a full-face
particle respirator.

11:41.184 --> 11:42.258
-LILA: Yes.
-Gas mask.

11:42.260 --> 11:44.351
Yes. Yes, that, please.

11:44.353 --> 11:45.611
But if we're gonna
go by the book,

11:45.613 --> 11:48.355
those are only deployed
for medical reasons.

11:48.357 --> 11:50.783
Captain, can you see
any medical reasons?

11:50.785 --> 11:53.436
Uh... no, not a one. Mm.

11:53.772 --> 11:56.456
Well, in that case,
it falls to the sole discretion

11:56.458 --> 11:58.157
of the firefighter
in charge of equipment.

11:58.159 --> 12:00.260
(scoffs) And who's that?

12:01.446 --> 12:02.128
(Lila whimpers)

12:02.130 --> 12:03.796
-Oh. (groans)
-Oh, no.

12:03.798 --> 12:05.131
OWEN:
What do you say, Marwani?

12:05.133 --> 12:06.950
-Should we give 'em a break?
-(exhales)

12:06.952 --> 12:08.284
Now, that depends.

12:08.286 --> 12:10.878
We promise whatever happens,
we won't sue.

12:10.880 --> 12:12.305
That's good.

12:12.307 --> 12:14.232
But I am gonna need
one more thing.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.569
Anything. Just get us out.

12:18.721 --> 12:20.071
<i> Hey, guys, Firefox here.</i>

12:20.073 --> 12:23.483
<i> I ran into some friends</i>
<i> at work today</i>

12:23.485 --> 12:25.802
<i> and they really,</i>
<i> really wanna say "Hey."</i>

12:26.246 --> 12:27.804
-(unenthusiastically):<i> Hey.</i>
-MARJAN MARWANI:<i> Aw.</i>

12:27.806 --> 12:30.114
MATEO:
<i> Let us help you to hear</i>
<i> a little bit better.</i>

12:30.116 --> 12:32.158
-MARJAN:<i> Oh, look at that.</i>
<i> Go ahead, guys.</i>
-MATEO:<i> Here we go.</i>

12:32.160 --> 12:34.327
<i> I'm Lila Geralds.</i>

12:34.588 --> 12:35.903
<i> And I'm Mitch.</i>

12:35.905 --> 12:41.334
<i> And we'd like</i>
<i> to give our heartfelt thanks</i>

12:41.336 --> 12:45.488
<i> to the brave heroes</i>
<i> of the Austin Fire Department.</i>

12:45.490 --> 12:47.265
-MITCH:
<i> For bravely rescuing us.</i>
<i> -Hey-oh!</i>

12:47.267 --> 12:49.492
<i> Oh, yeah.</i>
<i> Rescuing you from...</i>

12:49.494 --> 12:52.937
<i> Another... crappy situation</i>
<i> of our own making.</i>

12:52.939 --> 12:58.443
<i> Well, on behalf of the 126,</i>
<i> we'd like to say</i>
<i> you're welcome.</i>

12:58.445 --> 13:00.353
<i> Oh, and to</i>
<i> any of you who, uh,</i>

13:00.355 --> 13:04.357
contributed
to the Geralds'
GoFundMe page,

13:04.359 --> 13:06.692
<i> I'd like you to know</i>
<i> that 100 grand of that</i>

13:06.694 --> 13:11.272
<i> was spent on this car</i>
<i> in that dung pile over there.</i>

13:11.274 --> 13:12.123
Yeah.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.518
So on behalf of my followers...

13:15.520 --> 13:16.369
(laughs)

13:17.188 --> 13:20.948
<i> ...next time, why don't</i>
<i> y'all go fund yourselves?</i>

13:20.950 --> 13:22.050
MATEO:<i> Oh!</i>

13:24.212 --> 13:26.863
Alright, well, then,
let's stick with New England.

13:26.865 --> 13:29.532
Um... how about Rhode Island?

13:29.534 --> 13:31.142
-BOTH:<i> Providence.</i>
-TOMMY VEGA: Yes.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.219
Yeah, you're showing off
a little bit for me.

13:33.221 --> 13:34.979
Alright, well, then
give me New York.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.372
<i> Easy. It's New York.</i>

13:36.374 --> 13:38.316
(imitates buzzer buzzing)
No.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.226
No, that's a trick question.

13:40.228 --> 13:41.394
I know it feels like New York

13:41.396 --> 13:43.379
should be
the capital of New York,

13:43.381 --> 13:44.305
but it is not.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.065
(sighs)<i> When are we</i>
<i> ever going to need</i>

13:46.067 --> 13:47.550
<i> to know state capitals?</i>

13:47.828 --> 13:49.310
All the time.

13:49.721 --> 13:50.829
IZZY:<i> Like when?</i>

13:51.072 --> 13:53.814
Like for game shows.

13:53.816 --> 13:55.058
-(laughs)
-TOMMY: Laugh.

13:55.060 --> 13:56.225
When you miss out

13:56.227 --> 13:58.227
on a brand-new set
of washer and dryers,

13:58.229 --> 14:01.989
well, just because you didn't
know the capital of New York...

14:01.991 --> 14:03.399
<i> Albany.</i>

14:03.401 --> 14:04.917
Were you messin' with me?

14:04.919 --> 14:07.161
Were you playing a trick
on mom right now?

14:07.163 --> 14:08.847
IZZY:
<i> Don't worry,</i>
<i> we got this, okay?</i>

14:08.849 --> 14:09.830
IZZY AND EVIE:
<i> We gotta go.</i>

14:09.832 --> 14:10.756
I love you to the moon.

14:10.758 --> 14:11.683
(kisses)

14:12.519 --> 14:15.353
-(Tommy chuckles)
-I've been to Albany,
and trust me,

14:15.355 --> 14:17.080
the capital really
should be New York.

14:17.082 --> 14:18.672
Right?
This is what I'm saying.

14:18.674 --> 14:19.673
They really need to fix that.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.860
I love how the girls
mess with you now.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.936
(laughs)
It's the best. Just...

14:24.606 --> 14:27.773
I don't know, watching them
turn into actual people.

14:27.775 --> 14:28.992
TK: Yeah.

14:32.097 --> 14:33.538
Cap, can I ask you a question?

14:33.540 --> 14:34.355
Sure.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.690
Did you always
wanna be a parent?

14:37.452 --> 14:40.103
Since my first
Cabbage Patch doll.

14:40.105 --> 14:41.287
(chuckling) Love that.

14:41.289 --> 14:43.623
So it was a matter
of when not if?

14:43.625 --> 14:44.790
Not exactly.

14:44.943 --> 14:47.201
It's like wanting to have kids
is one thing,

14:47.203 --> 14:49.462
but... being able to have 'em,

14:49.464 --> 14:51.723
that turned out to be
a whole other ball of wax.

14:51.725 --> 14:53.308
It wasn't easy?

14:53.894 --> 14:55.635
Fight of my life.

14:55.637 --> 14:56.561
Really?

14:57.455 --> 14:59.230
Well, we take for granted
those things

14:59.232 --> 15:02.125
that-that we think
will come easily,

15:02.127 --> 15:03.476
and-and then when they don't,

15:03.478 --> 15:06.070
it's, it's the hardest thing
in the world.

15:07.632 --> 15:08.555
How'd you handle it?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.326
Not well.
In the beginning it was, uh...

15:13.062 --> 15:13.912
I mean, I was angry.

15:14.414 --> 15:18.399
I was angry and depressed
and bone-tired.

15:18.401 --> 15:21.502
And... truth be told,
ready to quit.

15:22.664 --> 15:23.630
Why didn't you?

15:24.073 --> 15:25.314
Charles.

15:26.426 --> 15:30.836
Yeah. He-he convinced me that
all this heartache and struggle

15:30.838 --> 15:31.821
was gonna be worth it.

15:32.265 --> 15:33.598
So I'd get back in the ring

15:33.600 --> 15:36.008
and start slugging it out
all over again.

15:36.010 --> 15:37.560
Well, was he right?

15:38.329 --> 15:39.845
Was it worth the fight?

15:39.847 --> 15:41.439
What do you think?

15:44.427 --> 15:46.852
JOE:
Come on, come on.
Extend that right leg.

15:46.854 --> 15:49.155
PAUL: Alright, come on,
Marj, now you got this.
Push. Push, push, push.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.931
All right? Push, push, push.

15:50.933 --> 15:51.857
Will you stop?

15:52.393 --> 15:53.952
I'm doing PT,
I'm not giving birth.

15:53.954 --> 15:55.194
JOE:
Uh, he's right, though.

15:55.196 --> 15:56.862
You need to get
more extension in that leg.

15:56.864 --> 15:58.105
That's the only way
you're gonna get

15:58.107 --> 15:59.348
all the strength
in your hip flexor.

15:59.350 --> 16:00.441
-PAUL: Mm-hmm.
-I'm trying.

16:00.443 --> 16:02.776
Oh, come on.
It's like my man Yoda says.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.963
"Ain't no try, only do."

16:04.965 --> 16:07.281
Yeah, well, Yoda never
got shot in the gut.

16:07.283 --> 16:10.718
I need 20% more extension.

16:12.380 --> 16:13.620
(exhaling)

16:13.622 --> 16:15.865
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, you got it, Marj.

16:15.867 --> 16:17.642
You got it! Come on!

16:17.644 --> 16:18.726
Nice job. Release.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.146
-(sighs)
-Not bad, firefighter.

16:22.148 --> 16:24.465
(clears throat)
Not bad?

16:24.467 --> 16:25.299
JOE: Mm-hmm.

16:25.301 --> 16:27.210
I just gave you full extension.

16:27.212 --> 16:29.470
Yeah, you did.
I'm glad I didn't blink.

16:29.472 --> 16:32.565
Maybe next time you can hold it
for longer than... two seconds?

16:33.401 --> 16:36.569
You really do just
feed off my misery, don't you?

16:36.571 --> 16:37.887
I do.

16:37.889 --> 16:39.055
And it is delicious.

16:39.057 --> 16:41.390
(both chuckling)

16:41.392 --> 16:43.559
Ooh. My 1:15 just showed.

16:43.837 --> 16:45.294
See you next week.

16:45.730 --> 16:46.896
See ya.

16:46.898 --> 16:48.006
Peace.

16:53.662 --> 16:55.013
What?

16:55.015 --> 16:57.073
Oh, you really gonna act like
that didn't just happen?

16:57.075 --> 16:58.499
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:58.501 --> 17:01.001
I'm talking about you
and trainer Joe

17:01.003 --> 17:02.169
flirting it up
a storm over there.

17:02.171 --> 17:03.688
(scoffs) We were not flirting.

17:03.690 --> 17:07.025
Hmm. Okay, well, whatever
that was, it was on and poppin'.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.026
-(cell phone chimes)
-Shut up.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.318
(Paul chuckles)

17:11.013 --> 17:12.846
(Marjan laughs)

17:13.199 --> 17:16.759
My Geralds' poopy picture
just hit a million likes.

17:16.761 --> 17:18.453
Best week ever.

17:19.781 --> 17:21.330
Yeah, I bet.

17:22.934 --> 17:24.333
(chimes)

17:25.953 --> 17:27.295
Oh, my God.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.439
What is it?

17:30.441 --> 17:34.552
Salim and his periodontist
just had a baby.

17:34.554 --> 17:37.430
♪

17:42.211 --> 17:45.137
Eh. No offense,
it's not even that cute.

17:45.139 --> 17:46.230
I mean, for a baby, I mean.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.066
TK: Yeah,
its head is kinda pointy.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.809
Like a Conehead.

17:49.811 --> 17:52.052
Thanks, guys.
You're the best.

17:52.054 --> 17:54.297
-Ugly baby.
-Is it, though?

17:54.890 --> 17:55.631
You know what?
Give me this.

17:55.633 --> 17:56.632
-MARJAN: No.
-No.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.317
First of all, you need
to stop following Salim

17:58.319 --> 17:59.635
on socials, like, immediately.

17:59.637 --> 18:02.062
And second of all,
you need to stop moping.

18:02.064 --> 18:03.322
I just got punched
in the soul.

18:03.324 --> 18:05.232
Well, don't think of it
as a punch in the soul.

18:05.234 --> 18:06.250
Think of it
as a kick in the ass.

18:06.402 --> 18:07.993
And how's that
supposed to help exactly?

18:07.995 --> 18:09.570
Well, maybe this is
the universe's way

18:09.572 --> 18:11.071
of telling you that it's time
to get back out there

18:11.073 --> 18:12.315
and start looking
for Mr. Right

18:12.408 --> 18:14.592
instead of staring
in the rear-view at Mr. Wrong.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.002
-TK:
He's got a good point, Marj.
-I don't know.

18:17.004 --> 18:19.079
Look, I-I'm not ready
to start dating.

18:19.081 --> 18:21.490
You and Salim
broke up two years ago.

18:21.492 --> 18:22.934
You deserve a few sparks
in your life.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.161
I literally put sparks out
for a living.

18:25.163 --> 18:28.347
You know what? Even if
I did wanna start dating,

18:28.349 --> 18:31.016
it's a-a whole thing for me.

18:31.018 --> 18:33.760
A thing that I've actually
never done before.

18:33.762 --> 18:36.614
The guy has to be Muslim.
I'd want there to be a chaperon.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.765
-There's just...
-You mean like a babysitter?

18:38.767 --> 18:40.267
I mean, is that like,
a rule or something?

18:40.286 --> 18:43.195
'Cause my buddy Amir goes out
with chicks solo all the time.

18:43.197 --> 18:45.848
Though he could
actually use a babysitter.

18:45.850 --> 18:48.108
-(mouths) True.
-TK: So what are we
talking about here,

18:48.110 --> 18:49.368
like a professional chaperon?

18:49.370 --> 18:52.130
No, like my father,
uncle, cousin.

18:52.132 --> 18:54.114
-So family.
-Exactly.

18:54.116 --> 18:55.616
And mine are all in Miami.

18:55.618 --> 18:58.285
So even if I was ready
to put myself out there,

18:58.287 --> 18:59.137
I don't have any family here.

18:59.139 --> 19:01.139
That's a nice try, Marjan.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.199
You got a houseful
of family right here.

19:03.201 --> 19:04.958
When the man's right,
he is right.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.959
PAUL:
And he's right.

19:05.961 --> 19:07.294
So no excuses, Marjan.

19:07.296 --> 19:09.730
You want a chaperon,
you got plenty.

19:10.633 --> 19:11.298
Fine!

19:11.300 --> 19:12.558
I'll get back on Ascent

19:12.560 --> 19:13.225
and update my profile.

19:13.469 --> 19:14.576
-Let's go, Marj.
-NANCY: Whoo!

19:14.578 --> 19:16.729
-PAUL: Gettin' it goin'!
-It's a start.

19:17.064 --> 19:18.381
-Okay?
-What you mean a start?

19:18.383 --> 19:20.216
Well, one dating app
ain't gonna cut it.

19:20.218 --> 19:21.217
You gotta be on three.

19:21.219 --> 19:22.476
-PAUL: Hmm.
-At least.

19:22.478 --> 19:25.388
I mean, you know,
more pools, more fish.

19:25.390 --> 19:27.147
Why am I already
regretting this?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.408
You're gonna have ups
and you're gonna have downs.

19:29.410 --> 19:31.652
Never get too high
and never get too low.

19:32.397 --> 19:34.988
Finding your prince usually
means kissing a lot of frogs.

19:34.990 --> 19:36.582
You have to accept
out of the gate

19:36.584 --> 19:37.491
that no matter what you do,

19:37.735 --> 19:39.235
some of these dates
will be cringe.

19:39.237 --> 19:40.178
Great.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.828
Okay, we're gonna
need a safety word.

19:41.830 --> 19:42.663
A safety word?

19:42.665 --> 19:43.497
Oh, no. He is right.

19:43.499 --> 19:44.831
It's brutal out there, Marjan.

19:44.833 --> 19:45.999
So the chaperons
are gonna need

19:46.001 --> 19:47.018
like a code word to let us know

19:47.020 --> 19:48.561
when to pull
the ripcord for you.

19:49.672 --> 19:54.025
♪♪

19:55.695 --> 19:56.343
<i> Assalamu alaikum.</i>

19:56.345 --> 19:57.987
<i> Walaikum salam.</i>

19:58.847 --> 20:02.758
So, Omar, uh, you like tea?

20:03.094 --> 20:05.369
-You're hot.
-Wow. (laughs)

20:05.371 --> 20:06.429
Thank you.

20:06.539 --> 20:10.099
No, I mean,
you're sweating quite profusely.

20:10.101 --> 20:11.709
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.193
Uh, you know, I've never--

20:13.195 --> 20:15.271
I've never done
one of these before.

20:15.273 --> 20:16.939
Like a date, I mean.
(sharp exhale)

20:16.941 --> 20:19.366
I mean, I did with my fiancé.
Ex-- Ex-fiancé.

20:19.368 --> 20:21.961
Yeah, we'd known each other
since we were 12.

20:21.963 --> 20:23.612
His name is Salim.
He just had a baby.

20:24.390 --> 20:25.723
How many frogs did you
have to kiss, babe?

20:26.617 --> 20:29.209
The point is that if Disney
has taught us anything,

20:29.211 --> 20:31.287
it's that the prince
that you're looking for

20:31.289 --> 20:33.456
is usually the last guy
you'd expect.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.958
That's why you gotta insert
at least one comfort nerd

20:35.960 --> 20:36.901
into the lineup, Marj.

20:36.903 --> 20:38.477
-A comfort nerd?
-TK: Yeah.

20:38.479 --> 20:41.239
You know, someone who's chill
and will help take the ease off

20:41.241 --> 20:43.315
when it's time for,
you know, date day.

20:43.317 --> 20:45.392
Oh, yeah?
What does that guy look like?

20:45.394 --> 20:47.245
These are for you. (chuckles)

20:47.896 --> 20:49.822
Wow! Thanks.

20:49.824 --> 20:51.231
-They're beautiful.
-Wow.

20:51.233 --> 20:53.584
-They're gorgeous.
-Are they paper?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.753
I'm really into paper-based
floral arrangements.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.239
Way more sustainable
than ammonia-based fertilizers.
(chuckles)

20:59.241 --> 21:01.333
Eco-friendly and thoughtful.

21:01.335 --> 21:03.319
Okay, well, what's the word?

21:03.321 --> 21:05.579
I've always liked
the word "rutabaga."

21:05.581 --> 21:07.748
(chuckles) It's gonna be
a little tricky to work that

21:07.750 --> 21:08.657
into a conversation, Cap.

21:08.659 --> 21:09.492
Maybe for you.

21:09.585 --> 21:11.010
MARJAN:
Uh, okay, how about--

21:11.012 --> 21:12.995
how about, um, "popcorn"?

21:13.422 --> 21:14.997
Okay, I guess that works, too.

21:14.999 --> 21:16.165
Okay.

21:16.167 --> 21:17.683
Hassan, if you were to describe

21:17.685 --> 21:20.111
your occupation in one word,
what would it be?

21:20.113 --> 21:21.537
-Entrepreneur.
-Ah.

21:21.539 --> 21:24.857
Jake Bezos, you better look out,
'cause I'm coming.

21:24.859 --> 21:26.509
-Let's go, baby!
-Yeah!

21:26.511 --> 21:28.360
What if I told you
that there was a gym

21:28.362 --> 21:30.362
where next to
every workout machine

21:30.364 --> 21:31.514
there was a selfie station

21:31.516 --> 21:33.198
and no shirts
were ever required.

21:33.200 --> 21:35.126
-Sick!
-HASSAN: Right?

21:35.128 --> 21:37.277
You gotta keep that concept
under your hat, bro.

21:37.279 --> 21:38.945
I'm still out to VCs.

21:38.947 --> 21:40.689
It's like my<i> teta</i>
used to say,

21:40.691 --> 21:42.691
"Flowers bloom,
but are all gone too soon."

21:42.693 --> 21:44.193
Except these. (laughs)

21:44.195 --> 21:45.044
Your<i> teta?</i>

21:45.046 --> 21:46.211
It means grandma.

21:46.213 --> 21:47.954
Yeah, I know. I'm Lebanese.

21:47.956 --> 21:49.365
-No way.
-MARJAN: Yes way.

21:49.367 --> 21:50.808
-(Zain and Marjan laugh)
-ZAIN: What?

21:51.644 --> 21:55.204
So, uh, it says in your profile
you're a tax attorney.

21:55.206 --> 21:56.963
-Is that right?
-It's what I do.

21:56.965 --> 21:58.649
But it's not who I am.

21:59.060 --> 22:00.392
It's, it's not my passion.

22:00.394 --> 22:02.378
Oh. Well, what is your passion?

22:02.380 --> 22:04.471
I work in the
International Dog Rescue Space.

22:04.473 --> 22:05.214
Wow.

22:05.216 --> 22:06.157
It's kinda dorky,

22:06.159 --> 22:07.566
but, uh, I love pretty much

22:07.568 --> 22:08.901
anything Harry Potter.

22:08.903 --> 22:11.495
I'm suspicious of all
earthly passions, honestly.

22:11.497 --> 22:14.390
Right now, I'm obsessed
with my delts.

22:14.392 --> 22:17.168
I crowdsource financing
to arrange flights

22:17.170 --> 22:18.693
for dogs to get off the streets

22:18.695 --> 22:21.397
in countries all over the world
and into loving homes.

22:21.399 --> 22:25.158
Uh, we fly dogs
from Iran to Canada,

22:25.160 --> 22:27.345
Costa Rica, the US.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.162
The needs are, are endless.

22:29.164 --> 22:30.681
That's incredible.

22:30.683 --> 22:31.682
I know it sounds silly,

22:31.684 --> 22:33.926
but I think of them as my kids.

22:33.928 --> 22:36.245
Oh, no,
that doesn't sound silly at all.

22:36.247 --> 22:39.857
And speaking of,
how do you feel about kids?

22:39.859 --> 22:41.058
Like, how many?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.768
-Eight.
-Eight?

22:42.770 --> 22:44.344
Yeah. Unless you want more.

22:44.346 --> 22:46.088
Well, you're no longer
a spring chicken,

22:46.090 --> 22:48.257
we'd have to hurry, but, um,

22:48.259 --> 22:50.943
your build is strong, so...

22:50.945 --> 22:52.595
Do you think
they serve popcorn?

22:52.597 --> 22:54.263
Oh, look at the time
in here is somethin'...

22:54.265 --> 22:56.207
-Popcorn.
-PAUL: It's late.

22:56.209 --> 22:58.267
So, uh, how would
you feel about me

22:58.269 --> 22:59.935
working after having children?

22:59.937 --> 23:01.027
Fine with it.

23:01.029 --> 23:02.028
As long as they root
for Man United.

23:02.030 --> 23:02.938
Never!

23:02.940 --> 23:03.956
Arsenal or nothing.

23:03.958 --> 23:06.458
I'd be happy to be
a stay-at-home dad.

23:06.460 --> 23:07.443
Do you, baby.

23:07.628 --> 23:08.944
Somebody's gotta fund
the Hassan Dream.

23:08.946 --> 23:09.962
Hashtag life goals.

23:09.964 --> 23:13.039
You know, I'd really
love some popcorn.

23:13.041 --> 23:14.950
(scoffs)
In a tea house?

23:14.952 --> 23:15.951
Yeah.

23:15.953 --> 23:17.544
Why don't you go check, baby?

23:17.546 --> 23:18.729
Uh, okay.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.047
This is Dorothy.

23:21.475 --> 23:23.567
She lost her ears
on the streets of Tehran.

23:23.569 --> 23:24.460
Aw.

23:24.478 --> 23:26.812
She chewed the ears off her toy

23:26.814 --> 23:27.813
so that they match.

23:27.815 --> 23:29.314
Isn't that amazing?

23:29.316 --> 23:31.575
Oh, that is the
most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

23:31.577 --> 23:34.662
I can't rest until
I find her a forever home.

23:35.489 --> 23:36.455
Yeah.

23:36.824 --> 23:38.064
So what's your house?

23:38.066 --> 23:39.566
Oh, we work out of the 126.

23:39.568 --> 23:42.161
-TK: Mm-hmm.
-No, I mean
your Hogwarts house.

23:42.163 --> 23:44.905
Like I'm Ravenclaw.
I bet you are, too.

23:44.907 --> 23:45.814
Or Slytherin.

23:46.484 --> 23:48.259
Oh, my God. Please don't
tell me you're a Hufflepuff.

23:48.261 --> 23:51.262
I'm not really into
the whole Harry Potter thing.

23:51.264 --> 23:52.004
I don't...

23:52.748 --> 23:55.582
You know what?
I don't think
this is gonna work.

23:55.584 --> 23:56.475
Huh.

23:58.996 --> 24:00.329
Well, that was an experience.

24:00.331 --> 24:02.106
I always go full throttle.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.183
Hey, make sure
to follow me on Instagram.

24:04.185 --> 24:06.259
I've been trying
to boost that profile.

24:06.261 --> 24:07.761
Would appreciate it.

24:07.763 --> 24:08.929
Text me, bro.

24:08.931 --> 24:10.931
My man.
I like the goofy kid.

24:10.933 --> 24:11.991
Hmm.

24:13.101 --> 24:15.360
Marjan. Captain Strand.

24:15.362 --> 24:18.122
-This has been such a pleasure.
-Likewise.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.199
But I should
probably be going.

24:20.201 --> 24:22.275
Dorothy starts
tearing up the furniture

24:22.277 --> 24:23.961
if I'm, uh,
late for dinner time.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.946
So, we should do this again.

24:25.948 --> 24:27.047
I'd love that.

24:31.862 --> 24:33.387
-Bye.
-MARJAN: Bye.

24:37.793 --> 24:39.351
(Marjan giggles)

24:40.629 --> 24:43.147
-I think we just found a winner!
-(Owen chuckles)

24:43.149 --> 24:44.723
I think we just found an angel.

24:44.725 --> 24:46.709
Yeah. (chuckles)

24:46.711 --> 24:47.610
Oh. (sighs)

24:52.883 --> 24:55.067
Oh, man, look,
literally anybody

24:55.069 --> 24:56.160
can get ordained
to marry you guys.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.143
-Yeah?
-PAUL: Mm-hmm.

24:57.145 --> 24:57.995

And what's that entail?

24:57.997 --> 24:58.979
PAUL:
It's easy, man.

24:58.981 --> 25:00.331
I did it online.

25:01.726 --> 25:03.000
What's up, Marj?

25:03.002 --> 25:03.892
MARJAN:
Hey, are you getting full bars?

25:03.894 --> 25:04.893
'Cause I don't think I'm--

25:04.912 --> 25:06.078
I don't think
I'm getting full bars.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.654
-Yeah.
-TK: Yeah, me, too.

25:07.656 --> 25:10.007
-MARJAN: Oh...
-Wait, Paul, you're ordained?

25:10.009 --> 25:11.400
PAUL:
Yeah, I married
my cousin in Chicago

25:11.402 --> 25:13.159
-a couple of years back.
-Huh.

25:13.161 --> 25:14.512
MATEO:
What up? What up?

25:14.514 --> 25:17.072
-PAUL: Hey, yo.
-How we doin', family?

25:17.074 --> 25:18.257
What's up? We doin' good.

25:18.259 --> 25:20.166
Except for Marj,
who has no bars.

25:20.168 --> 25:22.745
Actually, I do
have bars, so, yeah.

25:22.747 --> 25:24.246
Girl, what is wrong?

25:24.248 --> 25:25.856
It's that Fauza guy.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.082
Is that the dog rescue guy

25:27.084 --> 25:28.859
or the young
Omar Sharif-looking guy?

25:28.861 --> 25:30.694
-It's the same guy.
-(Nancy chuckles)

25:30.696 --> 25:31.920
We really hit it off.

25:32.514 --> 25:35.090
You know, the date
literally ended with him saying,

25:35.092 --> 25:37.017
"We should do this again,"
and now nothing.

25:37.019 --> 25:39.094
Not a call or a single text.

25:39.096 --> 25:39.945
NANCY: Hmm.

25:39.947 --> 25:41.430
What were his exact words?

25:41.432 --> 25:44.375
Do this again
or do this again sometime?

25:44.377 --> 25:46.435
I don't know.
Does it make a difference?

25:46.437 --> 25:48.120
-PAUL: Hell, yeah.
-Oh, it makes
a big difference, Marj.

25:48.122 --> 25:49.213
That "sometime" qualifier

25:49.215 --> 25:51.197
takes it from the concrete
to the vague.

25:51.199 --> 25:52.775
Yup. Nuance matters.

25:52.777 --> 25:55.294
Well, nobody told me
I should be taking notes.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.555
You know what?
I hate this already.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.723
-Just means
you're doing it right.

26:00.968 --> 26:02.951
NANCY: Baby, who is
blowing up your phone?

26:02.953 --> 26:04.303
Oh, it's Hassan.

26:04.305 --> 26:05.729
Uh, he invited me
to his streetwear pop-up

26:05.731 --> 26:06.880
downtown later.

26:06.882 --> 26:08.290
Hassan?

26:08.292 --> 26:10.475
Wait, so you're getting
a second date before I am?

26:10.477 --> 26:11.476
(chuckles) That's great.

26:11.796 --> 26:13.462
You know what?
I'm just gonna bite the bullet

26:13.464 --> 26:15.555
and I'm going to text Fauza
and see if he's interested.

26:15.557 --> 26:16.982
-No, no, no, no!
-What's wrong with you?

26:16.984 --> 26:18.409
-Don't-don't do that.
-Why not?

26:18.411 --> 26:21.470
Because if you text him first,
you're gonna look thirsty.

26:21.472 --> 26:24.230
-Mm-hmm.
-So it's okay for him
to text me first,

26:24.232 --> 26:25.974
but not the other way around?

26:25.976 --> 26:27.067
-Yes.
-Why?

26:27.069 --> 26:28.327
(quietly) The patriarchy.

26:28.329 --> 26:30.087
Just wait it out
for a second, alright?

26:30.089 --> 26:32.815
Maybe he's just trying
to play it cool or something.

26:32.817 --> 26:33.816
For what?

26:33.926 --> 26:36.260
So that he can amp up
my neediness and anxiety

26:36.262 --> 26:39.488
only to relieve it
in a rush with one single text?

26:39.490 --> 26:41.340
You sure you've
never dated before?

26:41.342 --> 26:42.600
MARJAN:
You know what?

26:42.602 --> 26:45.661
I am not gonna fall
for this manipulative crap.

26:45.663 --> 26:47.104
I'm officially
putting away my phone.

26:47.106 --> 26:48.731
-Okay?
-(cell phone whistles)

26:51.927 --> 26:53.127

26:53.129 --> 26:54.594

26:54.596 --> 26:55.762

26:58.525 --> 26:59.116
Oh...

26:59.118 --> 27:01.009
She is in it now.

27:01.011 --> 27:02.745
Oh, yeah,
she is really in it now.

Not exactly.
My husband already checked in.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.347
His name is Yasir Karim.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.848
Could you just tell me
which room he's in?

28:04.850 --> 28:06.666
-It's K-A-R-I-M.
-DESK CLERK: Sorry.

28:13.192 --> 28:14.674
It doesn't, actually.

I'm not allowed to give out

28:18.364 --> 28:19.530

28:19.757 --> 28:22.090
I'm not asking for
his Social Security number.

28:22.092 --> 28:24.259
His car is out in front.
I know he's here.

28:24.261 --> 28:25.427
Well, then maybe you
should try calling him

28:25.429 --> 28:27.112
and asking him
what room he's in.

28:27.114 --> 28:29.415
I've been trying to call him.

28:30.692 --> 28:31.709

28:32.712 --> 28:33.860
He's not answering.

28:33.862 --> 28:36.196

I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

28:36.198 --> 28:38.607
I'm... seven months pregnant.

28:38.609 --> 28:39.591
Okay, um...

28:41.128 --> 28:44.370
Okay, look, I know he's here
with another woman.

28:44.372 --> 28:45.889
I just need to speak to him.

28:45.891 --> 28:46.965
You know,
like I'm asking you

28:46.967 --> 28:48.976
as a human being
to another human being.

28:49.470 --> 28:50.227
Please.

28:50.229 --> 28:52.396
And again, I'm gonna have to

28:52.398 --> 28:54.957
remind you of our hotel policy.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.977
I don't care about
your stupid hotel policy.

and your hotel policy.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.131
I will bang on every door
in this hotel if I have to.

29:04.802 --> 29:05.984
This really isn't a hotel.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.062
It's what you call
a no-tell motel.

29:09.064 --> 29:11.397

have to ask you to leave.

people this way.

33:57.928 --> 34:00.595
Uh, Fauza, what the hell, dude?

34:00.597 --> 34:01.354
Marjan?

34:02.099 --> 34:03.874
Wait. You know her?
You know him?

34:03.876 --> 34:07.210
Uh, not as Yasir,
but, yeah, Fauza.

34:07.212 --> 34:08.694
FARA:
Fa-- that's his brother's name.

34:08.696 --> 34:10.105
Does he have a twin?

34:10.107 --> 34:11.439
FARA: Uh, no.

34:11.441 --> 34:12.941
Oh, you're gonna
hear it from my lawyers

34:12.943 --> 34:14.009
and all my uncles!

34:15.036 --> 34:16.053
Please take me away, sir.

34:16.055 --> 34:18.280
Um, no, you're
gonna go with them.

34:18.282 --> 34:19.681
I'll, I'll meet you
in the hospital.

34:20.784 --> 34:22.284
Well, let's, um...

34:23.062 --> 34:24.895
You can forget about
Saturday night, too.

34:25.230 --> 34:27.397
(sighs) This is
so disappointing.

34:28.625 --> 34:29.691
You...

34:30.736 --> 34:32.319
are a disappointment.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.696
(siren chirps)

34:38.077 --> 34:40.151
TK! What a nice surprise.

34:40.153 --> 34:41.486
Hey, is this a bad time?

34:41.488 --> 34:42.320
No, no, no. Not at all.

34:42.564 --> 34:44.155
I know I should
have called, but--

34:44.157 --> 34:45.707
Do I smell fried chicken?

34:46.493 --> 34:47.367
Maybe.

34:47.369 --> 34:49.160
TK:
Dad, are you crushing

34:49.162 --> 34:51.246
an entire bucket
of chicken by yourself?

34:51.739 --> 34:53.148
Chicken buckets.

34:53.150 --> 34:54.649
Rough day?

34:54.651 --> 34:55.483
Oh, it's Fauza.

34:55.485 --> 34:57.319
-What a disappointment.
-Yeah.

34:57.321 --> 34:58.411
It's weird when they drop

34:58.413 --> 35:00.989
the preexisting
spouse bomb on you.

35:00.991 --> 35:02.099
Oh, that's right.

35:02.101 --> 35:03.916
Well, at least
Carlos divorced his.

35:03.918 --> 35:05.327
Annulled, but, yes.

35:05.329 --> 35:07.253
And that was never
a question for us.

35:07.255 --> 35:09.088
Now, the kids question.

35:09.090 --> 35:10.498
Whoa, wait a minute.
He has a kid?

35:10.500 --> 35:13.110
-No, he-he doesn't have a kid.
-Oh. (scoffs)

35:13.112 --> 35:16.521
I just found out
that he never wants to.

35:17.174 --> 35:19.023
Sounds like you could
use some chicken.

35:19.025 --> 35:20.492
(TK sighs)

35:27.200 --> 35:29.209
-How's this so good?
-Mm. Right?

35:30.111 --> 35:31.378
You know what scares me, Dad?

35:32.131 --> 35:33.355
Is what it says about us,

35:33.357 --> 35:34.689
that we've never
even discussed it.

35:34.782 --> 35:37.876
It says to me you avoided
the conversation on purpose.

35:37.878 --> 35:38.969
Avoided?

35:38.971 --> 35:40.362
I don't avoid.

35:40.364 --> 35:43.865
I think you didn't
ask TK about kids

35:44.368 --> 35:47.202
because you knew
what his answer would be.

35:47.204 --> 35:48.311
We're in such a good place.

35:48.313 --> 35:51.039
Also, we've been
really busy lately.

35:51.041 --> 35:52.891
For three years, Carlitos?

35:52.893 --> 35:54.042
<i> Por favor.</i>

35:54.060 --> 35:55.968
You're gonna
have to do better than that.

35:55.970 --> 35:57.562
People get busy.
That's the thing.

35:57.564 --> 35:58.563
Yeah, but not too busy

35:58.657 --> 36:00.490
to have a conversation
so foundational.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.233
And that's not
what healthy couples do.

36:02.235 --> 36:04.161
You know, your mother
and I never discussed

36:04.163 --> 36:05.478
what religion you were gonna be

36:05.480 --> 36:07.238
until I overheard her
scheduling your bris

36:07.240 --> 36:08.498
in the delivery room.

36:09.168 --> 36:12.560
Needless to say, a very
animated conversation ensued.

36:12.562 --> 36:14.504
You don't think
it's because I'm an addict?

36:14.506 --> 36:15.505
He's worried that I'll relapse?

36:15.749 --> 36:17.565
Maybe that's what's
really bothering you.

36:17.567 --> 36:21.085
No. I believe in TK's recovery
with my whole heart.

36:21.087 --> 36:22.679
Is that what he said
the reason was?

36:22.681 --> 36:26.624
No. He said it's because
he wants us to travel the world.

36:26.626 --> 36:28.092
(laughs)

36:29.079 --> 36:31.837
What?
I've only left the state,
like, twice in my life.

36:32.432 --> 36:35.083
And we had to take you
kicking and screaming
both times.

36:35.752 --> 36:40.363
(chuckles) You got homesick
after a weekend in Branson.

36:42.034 --> 36:43.366
<i> Ay, mi amor.</i>

36:43.368 --> 36:45.777
Why don't you tell me
what's really bothering you?

36:46.780 --> 36:49.764
Honestly, I don't feel
comfortable saying it out loud.

36:49.766 --> 36:51.524
Is it that you're worried

36:51.526 --> 36:53.526
that the child's not gonna
have a mother in their life?

36:53.528 --> 36:57.105
Because I'm here for you,
and so are your sisters.

36:57.107 --> 36:58.414
I know you are.

36:58.416 --> 37:01.701
I'm not worried about
who the mother will be.

37:01.703 --> 37:03.762
I'm worried about
who's going to be the father.

37:05.131 --> 37:07.039
And I don't mean TK.

37:07.041 --> 37:08.633
-TK: I blame you.
-Me?

37:08.635 --> 37:12.229
Yeah, because
I have such a great
father/son situation here,

37:12.231 --> 37:14.231
I wanted to, you know,
pay it forward.

37:14.233 --> 37:17.067
TK and Owen have always had
such a special relationship

37:17.069 --> 37:18.401
from the time he was little.

37:18.403 --> 37:21.738
I didn't start one with my dad
until two years ago.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.022
That is not true.

37:23.024 --> 37:24.649
I'm afraid I won't measure up.

37:24.651 --> 37:26.559
But I also don't wanna
push him into something

37:26.561 --> 37:27.635
that he doesn't want.

37:27.746 --> 37:30.229
Does that make me
compassionate or selfish?

37:30.231 --> 37:32.474
I can't answer that,
but what I can tell you

37:32.476 --> 37:35.901
is almost every time I put
your mother's needs before mine,

37:35.903 --> 37:37.087
I ended up being happier

37:37.089 --> 37:39.089
than if I'd gotten
what I thought I wanted.

37:39.091 --> 37:40.832
So you're saying
I should give up the dream?

37:40.834 --> 37:43.093
No.

37:43.095 --> 37:45.411
What I'm saying is that
you have to be considerate

37:45.413 --> 37:48.323
for his feelings
just as much as your own.

37:48.325 --> 37:50.350
And whatever you decide...

37:51.328 --> 37:52.994
you have to be
honest with him.

37:52.996 --> 37:54.329
And take what
the universe gives you.

37:54.331 --> 37:57.107
Because no matter
what happens,<i> mijo,</i>

37:57.109 --> 37:58.924
the most important thing...

37:58.926 --> 38:01.185
Is that TK's by my side.

38:01.838 --> 38:03.488
...'cause Carlos is my person.

38:03.857 --> 38:06.491
♪♪

38:11.515 --> 38:13.515
Okay. I got grape leaves,
I got rice, and I got garlic.

38:13.517 --> 38:18.110
You get the mint.
I'm gonna get
the Aleppo pepper.

38:18.112 --> 38:21.523
Right. And we need snoubar.

38:21.858 --> 38:23.282
Snoubar? What is snoubar?

38:23.284 --> 38:24.950
Probably under pine nuts.

38:24.952 --> 38:26.452
Oh, no,
Asha's allergic to nuts.

38:26.454 --> 38:27.804
-Oh.
-Is it gonna ruin it
if we don't use it?

38:27.806 --> 38:28.763
No, it's all good.

38:30.291 --> 38:32.792
Actually, you know,
I-I wanted to say thank you.

38:32.794 --> 38:35.461
Um, I appreciate you guys
inviting me over for dinner.

38:35.463 --> 38:37.372
But, you know, if you wanna
spend the night alone

38:37.374 --> 38:38.982
as a couple, I totally get it.

38:38.984 --> 38:40.466
I don't wanna be
a third wheel.

38:40.468 --> 38:42.485
Marjan, we are not inviting you.
You're helping me cook.

38:42.487 --> 38:44.379
How else am
I supposed to make a

38:44.381 --> 38:46.656
authentic
Lebanese mezze by myself?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.716
-(chuckles) Yeah,
that would be a disaster.
-(scoffs)

38:48.718 --> 38:50.827
-Okay, we need eggplant
for baba ghanoush.
-Yes.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.311
BOTH: Oh!

38:52.313 --> 38:53.888
-PAUL: Oh. Trainer Joe.
-Hey, you two!

38:53.890 --> 38:55.223
Hey.

38:55.225 --> 38:56.891
What are you,
what are you doing here...

38:56.893 --> 38:58.059
in a halal market?

38:58.061 --> 38:59.336
Well, I only eat halal meat,

38:59.338 --> 39:02.063
and I felt like a porterhouse.

39:02.065 --> 39:03.231
You're Muslim?

39:03.233 --> 39:04.916
Is that really such a shock?

39:04.918 --> 39:06.659
Yeah, kinda, you know.

39:07.420 --> 39:09.429
Because I'm Black
and my name is Joe?

39:10.682 --> 39:12.790
I was only messing with you
because I am Black

39:12.792 --> 39:13.758
but my name is actually Yusuf.

39:13.760 --> 39:15.076
(laughs) Right.

39:15.078 --> 39:17.095
Okay, well, how come you
never mentioned that

39:17.097 --> 39:18.429
in any of our sessions?

39:18.431 --> 39:21.432
Why would I? I don't bring
my personal life to work.

39:22.268 --> 39:23.935
-Yeah, I respect that. Yeah.
-JOE: Yeah.

39:23.937 --> 39:25.103
<i> Assalamu alaikum.</i>

39:25.105 --> 39:26.529
<i> Walaikum salam.</i>

39:31.352 --> 39:32.760
(laughter)

39:32.929 --> 39:35.613
Alright. It was, uh, it was nice
running into you, Joe. Yusuf.

39:35.615 --> 39:38.416
Uh, you, too.
I'll see you Thursday.

39:39.102 --> 39:40.860
Actually, uh...

39:41.362 --> 39:43.254
maybe you wanna see me tonight?

39:43.256 --> 39:45.048
I'm-I'm going
to this guy's house

39:45.050 --> 39:46.365
with his girlfriend for dinner,

39:46.367 --> 39:48.718
and I could really use
a fourth wheel.

39:49.963 --> 39:51.462
I don't know.

39:52.132 --> 39:53.448
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

39:53.450 --> 39:54.874
I'm sorry.
Forget I even asked.

39:54.876 --> 39:56.117
JOE:
I was gonna say,
I don't know

39:56.119 --> 39:58.469
if one porterhouse
would be enough.

39:59.305 --> 40:01.122
-You're messin' with me.
-JOE: Aah.

40:01.124 --> 40:03.066
-I was messing with you.
-(Marjan, Joe laugh)

40:03.068 --> 40:04.959
I would love to.

40:04.961 --> 40:06.611
-Yeah?
-JOE: Yeah.

40:07.981 --> 40:09.489
Cool. (laughs)

40:11.317 --> 40:13.660
-He wants me to-- Yeah.
-Yes. Yes, he does.

40:17.231 --> 40:19.249
(ambient street noise)

40:24.164 --> 40:26.998
-Hey, babe.
-Hi. Perfect timing.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.008
-How was your day?
-Good.

40:30.654 --> 40:33.171
-What are you cooking?
-Beef Wellington.

40:33.173 --> 40:34.973
Can I get you a glass of wine?

40:35.917 --> 40:37.158
First, tell me the occasion.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.268
No occasion.

40:38.270 --> 40:40.344
Just every night that
I get to spend with you

40:40.346 --> 40:41.688
is a night worth celebrating.

40:42.832 --> 40:43.998
Don't worry.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.525
This isn't a bribe.

40:48.763 --> 40:51.239
Well, neither is this.

40:53.893 --> 40:55.935
(chuckles) What is this?

40:55.937 --> 40:57.178
It's a surprise.

40:57.180 --> 40:57.862
(imitating Brad Pitt)
What's in the box?

40:57.864 --> 40:58.955
What's in the box?

40:59.106 --> 41:00.957
You do a horrible Brad Pitt,
you know that?

41:00.959 --> 41:02.033
I know, but you love it.

41:02.035 --> 41:03.442
I don't, actually,
but I do love you.

41:03.444 --> 41:06.020
-So, go on, open it.
-(TK inhales)

41:06.022 --> 41:07.255
(TK exhales)

41:09.042 --> 41:10.967
Oh, my God.

41:10.969 --> 41:12.969
A bearded dragon?

41:12.971 --> 41:15.029
-Babe, it's--
-Terrifying.

41:15.031 --> 41:16.598
Beautiful.

41:17.642 --> 41:18.866
Wow.

41:19.293 --> 41:21.126
Hey, little buddy.

41:21.128 --> 41:22.437
Hey. (chuckles)

41:23.039 --> 41:24.296
Hey, little guy.

41:24.298 --> 41:25.965
I know you're ready
to be a father.

41:26.968 --> 41:29.569
And I have no doubt that
you would be an amazing one.

41:30.989 --> 41:33.031
But I'm not so sure
I'm there yet.

41:34.993 --> 41:36.409
Or ever will be.

41:37.737 --> 41:39.078
TK: Hmm.

41:42.225 --> 41:44.225
I just wanted
to be honest with you

41:44.227 --> 41:47.003
and say that
this may be the only child

41:47.005 --> 41:49.088
we ever share together.

41:49.508 --> 41:50.465
Okay.

41:51.492 --> 41:52.825
Okay?

41:52.827 --> 41:53.760
Okay.

41:54.954 --> 41:56.254
Really? Are you sure?

41:56.256 --> 41:59.349
Carlos, would you
just take the yes?

41:59.851 --> 42:01.309
Okay.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.478
Yes, TK.

42:08.434 --> 42:12.177
Also, they told me
it likes to eat live crickets.

42:12.179 --> 42:14.030
-So, that's gonna be your job.
-(TK laughs)

42:14.032 --> 42:16.274
TK:
I got it.

42:16.276 --> 42:19.202
What should
we name this little guy?

42:19.204 --> 42:22.205
I was thinking Louis the Second
or Lou II.

42:22.207 --> 42:24.782
Why don't we ask him?
Let's see which one
he likes better.

42:24.784 --> 42:25.750
-Okay.
-Okay.

42:28.696 --> 42:29.712
Ohh, crap.

42:31.291 --> 42:32.757
He already got out,
didn't he?

42:33.943 --> 42:35.885
Couldn't have
gone far, right?

42:35.887 --> 42:38.638
Uh, Louis the Second?

42:39.874 --> 42:41.783
(grunts) Lou II?

42:41.785 --> 42:42.725
I'm never sleeping again.

42:43.878 --> 42:45.478
Oh, boy.
