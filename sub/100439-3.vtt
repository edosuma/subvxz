WEBVTT

00:12.095 --> 00:13.096
Where are we going?

00:13.931 --> 00:14.932
To see Sue.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.265
She's our community manager.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.187
The direct interface
between us and the players.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.273
My ears just popped.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.776
Yeah, we're pretty deep underground.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.070
It's just better for everyone
if she's down here.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.446
It's a difficult job.

00:29.530 --> 00:32.741
Dealing with angry feedback,
complaints and hate.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.618
She must be super depressed.

00:36.203 --> 00:40.290
No. That would be normal.
This is much worse.

00:42.417 --> 00:43.752
Visitors?

00:44.378 --> 00:45.379
Hey, Sue.

00:45.796 --> 00:49.299
David, it is so nice to see you.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.052
And who's this bag of sunshine
you brought with you?

00:52.135 --> 00:53.512
This is my assistant, Jo.

00:54.388 --> 00:55.722
-Say hi, Jo.
-Hi.

00:55.806 --> 00:58.100
Well, thanks for popping by, guys.

00:58.183 --> 01:01.979
I would love to come visit you upstairs,
but my darn key card isn't working

01:02.062 --> 01:04.355
and I tried talking to security about it,
but they--

01:04.982 --> 01:07.276
Listen to me blabbing on,
boring you to tears.

01:07.359 --> 01:10.571
Whoa. Okay, come on. Sit down. Sit.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.948
I don't like her. She's unsettling.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.116
I know.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.536
Catching up on a little bit of filing?

01:17.619 --> 01:20.581
This? No,
that's just some player feedback.

01:20.664 --> 01:24.710
E-mail has filters
that censor the more descriptive language.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.796
But God bless America, you still can't
censor the handwritten word.

01:27.880 --> 01:30.507
Right. So, Sue,
you said you had some urgent news?

01:30.591 --> 01:33.677
I sure do.
I got a call this morning from Kotaku.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.762
-Kotaku?
-Yes.

01:35.846 --> 01:40.475
They are running a front-page article
about MQ and asked for us to comment.

01:40.976 --> 01:44.730
"Front-page"? Not too shabby.
That's good news. What's the story?

01:44.813 --> 01:49.234
Well, apparently Mythic Quest is
the number one online role-playing game...

01:49.318 --> 01:50.360
Fantastic.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.321
...among white supremacists.

02:08.294 --> 02:11.965
Okay, listen up, everyone.
Important announcement up here.

02:12.049 --> 02:16.220
Big boss talking to her team.
Today's a big day.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.724
Today is the day that we launch
our newest and, if I do say so myself,

02:20.807 --> 02:23.810
most beautifully designed
new social networking feature.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.104
Dinner Party.

02:31.610 --> 02:35.197
A lot of hard work has gone into this
and now all that's left to do...

02:35.822 --> 02:36.949
is hit this button.

02:37.032 --> 02:39.701
Where is Ian?
Doesn't he usually do the speech?

02:39.785 --> 02:40.994
Yes, Michelle, he does.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.413
But I'm doing this one
because after the whole shovel thing,

02:43.497 --> 02:45.624
Ian finally agreed
to let me have something that's mine.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.835
And that thing is Dinner Party.

02:50.254 --> 02:52.840
It just seems like
a natural clapping mo-- Whatever.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.341
Just don't interrupt.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.969
So Ian didn't help.

02:57.886 --> 02:59.972
That's why the name's so confusing.

03:00.055 --> 03:01.390
It's not confusing, Michelle.

03:01.473 --> 03:04.476
What else would you call a feature that
allows players to connect across guilds

03:04.560 --> 03:05.894
and plan large-scale events?

03:05.978 --> 03:08.730
Have you ever been to a dinner party?

03:09.147 --> 03:11.608
Yes. Hundreds.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.862
Can you please stop being so negative
and don't interrupt anymore?

03:14.945 --> 03:18.407
I'm just gonna skip to the end.
Let's launch!

03:18.490 --> 03:20.576
And here we go.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.870
Poppy, David would like to see you.
It's an emergency.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.496
I'm kind of
in the middle of something, Jo.

03:24.580 --> 03:27.124
He said if you don't come,
I can grab you by the hair and drag you.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.251
-David said that?
-That was the subtext.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.753
-Just tell David I'm very busy.
-Doing what?

03:31.837 --> 03:32.838
Pushing a button.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.840
-It's more than just a button, Michelle.
-This button?

03:34.923 --> 03:36.049
No!

03:37.593 --> 03:41.346
Godda-- I just--
This was, like-- You ruined it.

03:41.430 --> 03:43.182
Great speech, boss.

03:43.265 --> 03:46.727
Oh, my God.
Jo, what could possibly be so urgent?

03:48.437 --> 03:50.439
We have Nazis in the game?

03:50.522 --> 03:52.858
Kotaku found a guild of 40 or so members

03:52.941 --> 03:56.820
who openly profess to playing our game
according to fascist principles.

03:56.904 --> 03:57.905
Okay, hold on.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.823
People use that word to mean
"anyone who disagrees with them."

03:59.907 --> 04:02.117
How can we be sure
that these are actual Nazis?

04:02.201 --> 04:03.827
Well, they did this with the shovel.

04:05.537 --> 04:06.914
-So?
-Yeah?

04:06.997 --> 04:08.373
Sorry.

04:10.334 --> 04:11.460
Yeah, those are Nazis.

04:11.543 --> 04:15.797
This is not what the shovel is meant for.
It was made to murder people.

04:15.881 --> 04:16.882
And dig dicks.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.091
They did that too.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.260
Wow.

04:20.344 --> 04:23.055
Say what you want about Nazis.
They are precise.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.264
That's German engineering.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.975
Oh, man. This is so upsetting.

04:27.059 --> 04:31.063
This whole Nazi thing is going to
completely overshadow Dinner Party.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.689
Guys, can we please focus
on the Nazis?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.024
'Kay? We gotta get rid of the Nazis.

04:34.107 --> 04:36.401
Perhaps we're being too hasty.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.071
Nazis make excellent villains.

04:39.154 --> 04:43.367
Have we considered embracing the Nazis,
narratively speaking?

04:44.535 --> 04:46.578
No. No, we haven't.
We're not embracing Nazis.

04:46.662 --> 04:49.373
We are kicking them out of the guild
and that's the end of discussion.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.709
C.W., I need you to draft an apology.
Immediately.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.836
Of course.

04:53.919 --> 04:58.257
Now, are we apologizing to the Nazis
or on their behalf?

05:01.760 --> 05:02.845
Neither.

05:02.928 --> 05:03.929
Of course.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.849
Okay. You know what?
I'm going to go kick out the Nazi guild.

05:06.932 --> 05:09.268
Wait, wait.
What are we gonna do about Dinner Party?

05:09.351 --> 05:10.352
Don't care.

05:11.562 --> 05:12.563
Yeah, Pop.

05:12.646 --> 05:16.525
No one's going to care about Dinner Party,
but we can't just kick out the Nazis.

05:16.608 --> 05:19.486
That's going to be
a whole First Amendment thing.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.321
Let me noodle on it.

05:25.951 --> 05:28.829
David. D-train. Dirty Dave.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.664
Maybe we should think
this Nazi thing through.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.292
I don't wanna spin you out here, David,
but I think we should slow this down.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.752
-I'm banning the Nazis, Brad.
-Hey, I respect that.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.672
But we've never banned
an entire group before.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.215
These are paying customers.

05:40.299 --> 05:41.466
Gross, Brad, even for you.

05:41.550 --> 05:43.719
Hey, I'm just saying,
we got to be careful how we respond.

05:43.802 --> 05:45.095
Sure, we created the platform,

05:45.179 --> 05:47.890
but should we be the ones deciding
who stays and who goes?

05:47.973 --> 05:49.725
It's the same problem that Facebook
and Twitter had to deal with.

05:49.808 --> 05:51.560
Hey, look,
somebody has to put their foot down.

05:51.643 --> 05:53.478
I agree, but let's think about this.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.397
What's it going to look like
when people find out

05:55.480 --> 05:58.108
that foot belongs to a straight white man

05:58.192 --> 06:00.194
writing the laws
that everyone has to live by?

06:00.277 --> 06:03.030
Does that seem fair?
Does that seem inclusive?

06:03.780 --> 06:04.781
Okay, see ya.

06:06.325 --> 06:09.453
Wait. Brad? I want to be more inclusive.

06:09.536 --> 06:12.122
We should consult
some diverse perspectives, like you.

06:12.206 --> 06:13.207
What do you mean?

06:13.290 --> 06:16.335
Well, you know, 'cause you're...
Can I say "Indian"?

06:16.835 --> 06:18.462
Well, why can't you say it?

06:18.545 --> 06:20.339
I don't know. I mean, I--

06:20.422 --> 06:22.508
-What's wrong with being Indian?
-Nothing.

06:22.591 --> 06:24.426
I'm also Polish, if that's better for you.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.511
-No.
-No?

06:25.594 --> 06:27.387
I mean, yes. Or... I don't know.

06:27.471 --> 06:30.098
I'm just trying to do what's right here.

06:30.182 --> 06:31.517
Will you please help me? Please?

06:31.600 --> 06:35.103
We can form an ethics committee.
Make the decisions together.

06:35.187 --> 06:36.355
Okay. A committee.

06:36.438 --> 06:39.358
And you know what?
We should get some girls involved.

06:39.942 --> 06:40.943
Women.

06:41.485 --> 06:43.737
"Women." Right.

06:45.364 --> 06:46.573
Hey, women.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.285
That felt weird. Listen.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.872
Brad and I are putting together
a little ethics committee.

06:54.331 --> 06:58.335
And, Dana, we would love
to have your unique... perspective?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.419
-Good.
-Yeah.

06:59.503 --> 07:00.587
So, will you join us?

07:00.671 --> 07:03.715
Could I join?
I would really love to help any way I can.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.844
Oh, that's...

07:08.345 --> 07:09.721
What do I say here?

07:09.805 --> 07:14.268
It's just
your perspective has been... filled.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.936
Yeah, we don't need two white chicks.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.521
No, Jo. That's not even it.

07:17.604 --> 07:21.608
Okay? It's not a racial thing.
It's more of a... She's...

07:21.692 --> 07:24.152
-Annoying.
-Can you say that?

07:24.236 --> 07:25.237
That's totally fine.

07:25.320 --> 07:26.405
-Really?
-Yeah.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.949
-I'm annoying?
-Yes.

07:29.032 --> 07:30.784
So, Dana, do you want to get going?

07:30.868 --> 07:32.744
-Right now?
-Yeah. Let's go.

07:32.828 --> 07:33.829
'Kay.

07:35.414 --> 07:36.498
Help me.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.001
I'm gay.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.545
You are? I mean, of course, you are.

07:41.628 --> 07:44.173
Not "of course." I mean, that's great.

07:44.256 --> 07:48.760
Yes. That is my unique perspective.
I am a lesbian.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.470
We could use one of those.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.347
"One of those"? This is going well.

07:52.431 --> 07:55.809
No, no. It's still not right.
It needs to be higher and straighter.

07:55.893 --> 07:59.563
You know, usually at this point,
Poppy jumps in and takes over.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.983
Well, I'm not going to allow that
to happen, okay, Michelle?

08:03.066 --> 08:07.196
Because I need you to do it.
I work through you.

08:07.279 --> 08:10.657
Okay. It's like I'm an artist
and you're my favorite brush.

08:10.741 --> 08:12.367
What are you doing down here?

08:12.451 --> 08:15.287
I'm trying to manipulate Michelle
into doing what I want.

08:15.370 --> 08:17.206
-Is she doing a bad job?
-Yeah, she sucks.

08:17.289 --> 08:18.582
Yeah, she's terrible at her job.

08:18.665 --> 08:22.211
Get up, Michelle. Move your arse.
Come on. Up, up. Thank you.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.796
-What's the problem?
-Yeah, you see right here.

08:24.880 --> 08:29.009
I need to get that up higher and then more
of an extension and straight.

08:29.092 --> 08:32.638
You just need to adjust a couple
of the keyframes on the animation and...

08:32.721 --> 08:34.640
-Look at that!
-Yeah.

08:34.722 --> 08:35.724
You're the best! Look at how--

08:35.807 --> 08:36.808
-That's perfect.
-I know because--

08:36.892 --> 08:38.352
-You're my favorite brush.
-That's right. I am your--

08:38.433 --> 08:40.520
-Oh, my God. Is that a...
-Yeah. A Nazi salute.

08:40.604 --> 08:43.815
Yeah.
I really want to get him heiling Hitler.

08:43.899 --> 08:44.900
-Why?
-Okay.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.152
It's all a part of my plan
to smoke them out.

08:47.236 --> 08:51.365
You see, we're going to release the emote,
but then publicly say it's a glitch.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.493
But these skinhead freaks,
they're not going to be able to resist.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.870
They're going to pass it
amongst their friends,

08:56.954 --> 08:58.664
and then they're going to come out
of the shadows.

08:58.747 --> 08:59.790
This is insane.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.375
I think it's awesome.

09:01.458 --> 09:04.002
Okay, so she thinks it's good.
What does that tell you?

09:04.086 --> 09:06.296
Nazi emotes,
secret plans, rounding them up.

09:06.380 --> 09:07.464
Can you hear yourself?

09:08.757 --> 09:10.884
No. But I wish I could.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.678
We should be recording this for posterity.

09:12.761 --> 09:15.013
-I am recording this.
-Cool. Send it to me.

09:15.097 --> 09:16.807
Stop recording. Put that away.

09:16.890 --> 09:21.186
Listen, you are not in the right headspace
to be making decisions like this.

09:21.270 --> 09:23.647
And also, I already have a better plan.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.316
We're going to organize
a peaceful protest using...

09:26.733 --> 09:28.193
Dinner Party.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.904
And that way, we show the Nazis
that they're not welcome in MQ

09:30.988 --> 09:33.448
while simultaneously,
yet tastefully, promoting my feature.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.869
So you want to use the Nazis
to promote your feature?

09:36.952 --> 09:37.995
-Yeah.
-Gross.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.246
I tried telling her that.

09:39.329 --> 09:40.497
She's very stubborn, Michelle.

09:40.581 --> 09:41.915
Okay, screw you both.

09:42.457 --> 09:45.627
Going to do it myself. I don't need you.
You're uninvited to the protest.

09:45.711 --> 09:48.297
Okay, Michelle. Let's get back to work.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.507
My work or your work?

09:52.092 --> 09:53.552
Dear my, you are salty.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.310
Welcome to the first meeting
of the ethics committee.

10:01.393 --> 10:03.103
I feel like
we got a good mix of people here.

10:03.187 --> 10:05.189
Should we go around and say what we are?

10:05.272 --> 10:06.398
-Let's not do that.
-No? Okay.

10:06.481 --> 10:10.736
So, our first order of business is
we need to come up with a code of conduct.

10:10.819 --> 10:11.820
See, the problem is,

10:11.904 --> 10:14.198
we don't know which rules
the Nazis are violating

10:14.281 --> 10:15.490
because we don't have any rules.

10:15.574 --> 10:17.367
So, let's make some. Easy.

10:17.451 --> 10:18.452
-Easy.
-Yeah.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.828
As long as we're consistent.

10:19.912 --> 10:22.456
Once we start banning groups,
it's a bit of a slippery slope.

10:22.539 --> 10:27.878
Well, how's this for consistent?
"No hate groups."

10:27.961 --> 10:31.256
I don't want to spin you out here, David,
but what is a hate group?

10:31.340 --> 10:32.716
I mean, do homophobes count?

10:32.799 --> 10:34.092
Yes. They hate gay people.

10:34.176 --> 10:36.261
-What about misogynists?
-Yes. They hate women.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.305
-Pedophiles?
-Sure. They hate...

10:39.723 --> 10:40.724
Puberty?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.726
Are pedophiles really a problem
in the game?

10:42.809 --> 10:45.354
No, no. But let's make sure
they don't become one, right?

10:45.437 --> 10:47.981
Sorry. I guess I'm just a little...
confused because--

10:48.065 --> 10:49.149
"Confused?"

10:49.233 --> 10:52.819
Because you said that you were gay.
And if you're not gay, you have to leave.

10:52.903 --> 10:56.448
I'm gay. I am a proud gay woman.

10:56.532 --> 10:58.700
I just don't understand
what we're doing here.

10:58.784 --> 11:03.872
Okay. Rachel, can you just...
turn the volume down? Only a little bit?

11:03.956 --> 11:04.957
We're all proud here.

11:05.040 --> 11:09.086
Brad is a proud Indian Polish man.
Did you know that? Right, Brad?

11:10.379 --> 11:12.673
And Jo, she's a proud...

11:12.756 --> 11:14.591
Wholesome Midwestern conservative.

11:15.843 --> 11:16.844
Great.

11:16.927 --> 11:19.388
And I'm a proud white man, but I
don't go around saying "white pride."

11:19.471 --> 11:21.557
-David.
-Sorry. That's not what I meant.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.351
I said I didn't say that.
Anyway, pedophiles make the list.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.561
Boom.

11:25.644 --> 11:26.854
Way to go, Jo.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.273
Man, we are cooking with gas.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.234
Yeah. Great, yeah.

11:32.317 --> 11:36.280
Maybe a little bit more shading in here
and a little bit more angular down here.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.739
Great work.

11:40.868 --> 11:42.286
My presence was requested?

11:42.369 --> 11:44.204
Yes. C.W., now about that apology--

11:44.288 --> 11:49.418
Just finished it and I'm quite pleased.
It's conciliatory without seeming weak.

11:49.960 --> 11:54.798
I adapted it from a previous apology
I gave to the San Diego Women's Museum.

11:57.843 --> 11:58.844
Weird.

11:59.303 --> 12:03.098
Yeah. Change of plans though.
We are now going to embrace the Nazis.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.685
-Wonderful. I'll get on it right away.
-Great.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.147
Sue.

12:12.858 --> 12:14.776
Hey, Sue.

12:14.860 --> 12:17.446
Hi there. Sorry to bug ya.

12:17.529 --> 12:21.074
But I couldn't help but notice that
those darn Nazis are still in the game.

12:21.158 --> 12:24.369
Don't worry, Sue. I've been working on
a patch that's going to fix everything.

12:24.453 --> 12:26.455
A patch to block the Nazis?

12:27.080 --> 12:29.333
No. A patch to wear on their uniforms.

12:29.416 --> 12:30.417
Rio.

12:33.337 --> 12:36.632
You know, I think
there might be a smudge on my lens,

12:36.715 --> 12:40.344
'cause that looks
an awful lot like the SS symbol.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.845
Yeah, SS.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.388
Well, not officially though.

12:43.472 --> 12:48.060
No. Publicly we'll say that it's just like
black lightning or something like that.

12:48.143 --> 12:49.770
But the Nazis are going to love this.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.898
They are going to adopt this, trust me.
Trust me, the Nazis will love it.

12:52.981 --> 12:54.024
Thank you, Rio.

12:54.608 --> 12:56.944
Okay. Yeah. So--

12:58.111 --> 13:02.241
You seem to be adding more Nazi stuff.

13:02.324 --> 13:06.870
And what we need to be doing
is subtracting Nazi stuff.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.498
'Cause we really want zero Nazis.

13:09.581 --> 13:12.459
Zero is our target number of Nazis.

13:12.543 --> 13:13.544
Totally agree.

13:13.627 --> 13:16.672
But the best way to catch a Nazi
is with a little bit of honey.

13:17.297 --> 13:21.176
No, no. It can't take that long.

13:21.260 --> 13:23.387
It has to end today, Ian. Okay?

13:23.470 --> 13:26.473
It's got to end today or else
there's going to be another Kotaku article

13:26.557 --> 13:27.724
and it's going to get real bad.

13:27.808 --> 13:32.729
As bad as the Nazi alchemist
who used his skills to concoct a potion

13:32.813 --> 13:35.858
which wiped out an entire race
of dark elves?

13:35.941 --> 13:37.776
No, no. Is that in the game too?

13:37.860 --> 13:39.611
No, but it could be.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.573
And what an engaging story that would be.

13:42.656 --> 13:45.075
Gosh.
Feels like I'm just herding cats here.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.160
Which, if it's on the weekend,
I usually enjoy.

13:47.244 --> 13:49.037
-Okay. Thanks, Sue. Thank you.
-Ian, don't mute me.

13:51.540 --> 13:55.711
Let's put it to a vote. All those in favor
of banning coastal elites from the game.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.422
And all those in favor of manspreaders.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.175
Well, there it is. It's settled.

14:01.258 --> 14:02.885
Coastal elites stay in the game.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.679
Hey, C.W., did you finish that apology?

14:05.762 --> 14:10.017
Yes, yes. What's this meeting about?
Why wasn't I invited?

14:10.100 --> 14:12.394
I demand the right to defend myself.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.730
This meeting isn't about you.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.692
Although, wait. You do bring
a different generational perspective.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.903
And that could add to the diversity
of the committee, right, Brad?

14:20.986 --> 14:23.071
Yeah, man. Okay. Have a seat.

14:23.155 --> 14:25.991
I have an opening in my schedule.
Catch me up.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.201
Okay. Well,

14:27.284 --> 14:30.204
we've compiled a list of all the groups
that we could potentially ban

14:30.287 --> 14:31.663
in addition to the Nazis.

14:31.747 --> 14:34.041
And, well, it turned out to be a lot.

14:34.124 --> 14:35.501
92% of our players.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.127
Yeah. Obviously,
we can't kick them all out,

14:37.211 --> 14:39.338
because then we wouldn't have a game.

14:39.421 --> 14:44.134
So, we needed a quick way
to whittle it down to the worst offenders.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.886
But we came up with a system.

14:48.347 --> 14:51.433
Well, the NCAA came up with it,
but Brad suggested it for us.

14:51.517 --> 14:53.060
-Marvelous.
-Hey, David.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.521
-How much longer is this meeting gonna go?
-We're almost done.

14:55.604 --> 14:57.898
Yeah. Just 63 quick decisions
and we're outta here.

14:57.981 --> 15:00.442
Sixty-two. Manspreaders on the board.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.402
All right.

15:03.195 --> 15:07.824
See if you move to here and I go...

15:10.953 --> 15:15.457
Hey, y'all. Poppy Li here.
Lead engineer at Mythic Quest.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.501
Oh, God. What are you doing?

15:17.960 --> 15:22.339
I know what you might all be thinking,
"This Poppy Li, she seems pretty cool."

15:22.422 --> 15:24.049
But you know what's not cool?

15:24.925 --> 15:25.926
Fascism.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.553
This is painful.

15:28.929 --> 15:32.224
Wouldn't it be great if there was a way
that we could all get together

15:32.307 --> 15:34.268
and celebrate our hatred of fascism?

15:34.351 --> 15:36.061
-Oh, God. Don't do it.
-Introducing...

15:36.144 --> 15:38.272
-Don't do it.
-Dinner Party.

15:40.732 --> 15:41.733
She did the hands.

15:41.817 --> 15:46.989
And today I'm going to use Dinner Party
to invite you all to a peaceful protest.

15:47.072 --> 15:52.661
Let's show those inbred Nazi chuds that
there is no place for them here at MQ.

15:52.744 --> 15:57.583
Using the very intuitive mechanics of DP
is simple, easy and fun!

15:57.666 --> 15:59.668
DP? Don't call it "DP."

15:59.751 --> 16:01.295
So, look out for that invite

16:01.378 --> 16:04.798
and keep your inbox open in the future
for some sweet DP action.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.884
Oh, dear God.

16:16.310 --> 16:18.395
You've joined a Dinner Party.

16:24.776 --> 16:28.405
Wow. This is the coolest thing ever.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.992
Hundreds of people gathered together
for peace.

16:32.534 --> 16:34.912
I added a little music to set the mood.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.331
Yeah.

16:37.414 --> 16:43.128
I know that some of you thought that
Dinner Party wasn't going to be a success.

16:43.837 --> 16:46.298
I'm happy to say
that you were wrong, Michelle.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.552
Hey, Michelle.
You were wrong, and I was right.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.054
So cool it with the online shopping.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.598
Actually, I'm watching this.

16:55.807 --> 16:59.436
That Nazi guild used Dinner Party
to join up with a bunch of other guilds

16:59.520 --> 17:02.231
to form some kind
of massive raiding party.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.607
Whatever. Can you just turn that off?

17:03.690 --> 17:06.318
I don't want to watch the Nazis.
I want to focus on the protest.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.612
They're going to the protest.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.906
-What?
-Here. I'll throw it up there for you.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.161
They have their own music.

17:18.413 --> 17:22.916
See, these guys are sitting there quietly,
completely defenseless,

17:23.335 --> 17:28.214
whereas these guys are armed to the teeth.

17:29.049 --> 17:33.720
Now, why would someone bring weapons
to a peaceful protest?

17:34.388 --> 17:36.348
Guess we're about to find out.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.475
Maybe I can reason with them.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.980
Guess not.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.986
This is a peaceful gathering!

17:50.904 --> 17:52.447
Come on, guys.

17:53.657 --> 17:54.783
Why are you doing this?

17:54.867 --> 17:56.285
Help!

17:56.368 --> 17:57.828
Why? Why?

18:08.338 --> 18:09.673
Oh, my God.

18:14.970 --> 18:15.971
Yay!

18:16.680 --> 18:19.683
What a great Dinner Party.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.153
Poppy! Pop-Tarts. Pop--

18:33.197 --> 18:34.198
Go away.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.451
Poppy, I saw the raid. It was awesome.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.537
Don't rub it in.

18:40.621 --> 18:43.540
Dinner Party is a huge flop.
I'm just going to kill it.

18:43.624 --> 18:46.668
-No. No, Poppy. You can't do that.
-Bugger off.

18:46.752 --> 18:50.172
Pop, you don't understand.
You are a genius.

18:52.758 --> 18:53.759
Go on.

18:53.842 --> 18:57.846
You were able to accomplish something
that I couldn't do all day long.

18:57.930 --> 18:59.348
You drew them out.

18:59.431 --> 19:01.600
So, now, instead of there being,
like, 40 Nazis,

19:01.683 --> 19:03.602
there's 4,000 Nazis in the game.

19:04.436 --> 19:05.854
Cool?

19:05.938 --> 19:08.106
-Yeah. It's super cool.
-Is it?

19:08.190 --> 19:10.943
Yes! Yes, because we drew them out
from the shadows.

19:11.026 --> 19:12.027
Okay, great.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.154
So, I guess now you can go murder them all

19:14.238 --> 19:16.240
or punch their mums
or whatever it is you're going to do.

19:16.323 --> 19:19.117
No. Poppy, you don't understand.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.745
Violence is not the answer.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.541
Violence is always your answer.
You have a battle-ax in your office.

19:26.583 --> 19:27.584
That's true.

19:27.668 --> 19:29.962
Violence is very oftentimes
the best answer.

19:30.045 --> 19:32.422
But not when you're dealing with Nazis.

19:33.006 --> 19:36.969
Although, historically, that has been
the best method to deal with Nazis.

19:37.052 --> 19:39.680
I think that's with most people,
you should be using violence--

19:39.763 --> 19:40.931
But this is different, all right?

19:41.014 --> 19:43.976
Nazis want us to punch them in the face.
It makes them stronger.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.186
It gives them something to fight against.

19:46.270 --> 19:49.273
So we're going to do something
much, much worse.

19:56.864 --> 19:59.950
Okay. We have an answer.

20:03.579 --> 20:04.997
It's Nazis. Fuck.

20:05.455 --> 20:08.208
It's literally the same thing
we started the day with.

20:08.292 --> 20:09.960
But you know what?
We got there the right way,

20:10.043 --> 20:11.545
and that's what's important.

20:11.628 --> 20:14.464
And I learned that
when it comes to making decisions--

20:14.548 --> 20:17.509
What's the expression?
"There's more than one way to skin a cat"?

20:18.010 --> 20:19.011
"Skin a cat."

20:19.094 --> 20:22.389
I don't want to spin you out here, David,
but animal abusers, we forgot about them.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.474
-Let's put them on the board.
-No, no, no.

20:24.558 --> 20:26.101
We do not want
PETA coming after our asses.

20:26.185 --> 20:28.395
No! No, Brad.

20:28.478 --> 20:30.397
I know what you're doing,
and it's going to stop now.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.649
We have found the solution! This is it!

20:34.776 --> 20:36.278
Ethics Committee dismissed.

20:40.991 --> 20:41.992
All right. Good night.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.706
-All right. Check it out, check it out.
-Yes, yes, yes.

20:48.665 --> 20:49.666
Yes!

20:51.376 --> 20:53.754
Hey. There you are. Great news.

20:53.837 --> 20:56.673
After a lot of careful consideration,
I've finally made my decision.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.217
We are kicking out the Nazis.

20:58.300 --> 20:59.384
We already handled the Nazis.

21:02.095 --> 21:04.223
What? They're still in the game.
There's, like, a million of them.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.892
We tied all their accounts
to an isolated server.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.143
It's kind of brilliant.

21:08.227 --> 21:10.229
This way they can spew their bullshit
all day long

21:10.312 --> 21:11.438
and there's no one there to hear it.

21:11.522 --> 21:14.483
But they're still fighting
and shouting abuse.

21:14.566 --> 21:16.151
I mean, don't they know they're alone?

21:16.944 --> 21:19.571
Nope. It's an echo chamber.
A Nazi echo chamber.

21:19.655 --> 21:20.822
It's a prison.

21:21.240 --> 21:24.451
One where they can do what they do,
but to each other.

21:24.535 --> 21:26.370
-Shut up, you cuck.
-You're the cuck!

21:26.453 --> 21:28.497
-Go back to your country.
-My blood's pure.

21:28.580 --> 21:32.042
And we got all of them.
Every single one of them.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.504
And it's all because of
Poppy's feature, Dinner Party.

21:35.587 --> 21:38.340
-You did the hands. Yes.
-Of course I did the hands. Hands.

21:38.423 --> 21:39.466
What "the hands"?

21:39.550 --> 21:42.261
-David, stop trying to get into our thing.
-It's kind of an "in" thing.

21:42.344 --> 21:43.720
-Get into us.
-Whatever. I don't care.

21:43.804 --> 21:45.097
I'm just glad the day is over.

21:45.180 --> 21:46.473
Hey, here's a fun riddle.

21:46.557 --> 21:50.936
If a Nazi digs a swastika in the forest
and no one's around to see it,

21:52.563 --> 21:53.730
does it really matter?

21:54.147 --> 21:55.816
Nope. It doesn't.

21:56.942 --> 21:58.110
Can I get some wine?

21:58.193 --> 22:00.612
Yes. Sit down.

22:02.406 --> 22:03.657
Hey, hey.

22:03.740 --> 22:08.078
Wine, food, conversation amongst friends.

22:08.161 --> 22:11.123
One might almost call this a dinner party.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.667
-Hey! Poppy's first dinner party!
-Look at that!

22:13.750 --> 22:16.086
-We all know I've been to a bunch.
-Cool.

22:16.170 --> 22:18.463
I'm going to pull out the spreadsheet
for the gift exchange.

22:18.547 --> 22:21.049
Yeah. She's never been to a dinner party.
This is her first one.

22:21.133 --> 22:23.677
-This is her first one. That's so sad.
-Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely.
