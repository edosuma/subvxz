WEBVTT

00:02.300 --> 00:02.930
- Previously
on "Emerald City"...

00:02.969 --> 00:03.630
- My mother was in Oz.

00:03.670 --> 00:05.600
- Find the girl. She must die.

00:05.640 --> 00:07.480
- How long have you been
in The Wizard's Guard?

00:07.510 --> 00:09.420
I know what The Wizard's Guard
did at Nimbo.

00:09.440 --> 00:11.440
- Beast Forever
takes many forms.

00:11.480 --> 00:14.490
- So who stopped it before?
- A wizard, with those.

00:14.520 --> 00:16.590
- I don't think you
ever controlled the Giants.

00:16.620 --> 00:18.520
I think their power
is locked inside

00:18.550 --> 00:20.320
the Prison of the Abject.

00:20.350 --> 00:22.220
- What you are right now,
that's what happens

00:22.260 --> 00:24.430
when the medicine itself
wears off.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.600
- I'm a boy.
I've always been a boy.

00:26.630 --> 00:29.670
- This is how you were born.

00:29.700 --> 00:31.500
- What the hell are you doing?

00:31.530 --> 00:33.500
- I'm sorry!
- This isn't me!

00:33.530 --> 00:35.330
- Oh!

00:38.470 --> 00:40.500
[electricity crackling]

00:40.540 --> 00:43.610
[flame roaring]

00:46.210 --> 00:49.250
[tense music]

00:49.280 --> 00:51.680
[machine whirring]

00:51.720 --> 00:56.400
- [grunting]

00:56.420 --> 00:59.460
- It's all right.

01:00.990 --> 01:03.560
Don't be frightened.

01:07.700 --> 01:10.670
[somber music]

01:36.300 --> 01:37.640
- No one deserves that fate.

01:42.440 --> 01:44.240
- I'm a killer.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.470
- Is that so?

01:46.510 --> 01:48.610
- Captain!

01:50.780 --> 01:53.650
- If you let me
join your brigade,

01:53.680 --> 01:55.980
I'll kill for you.

01:56.020 --> 01:59.630
- What will your family
think about that?

01:59.650 --> 02:01.820
- I have no family.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.500
- Well, then maybe I do
have a place for you.

02:10.759 --> 02:14.730
[branches snapping]

02:14.770 --> 02:16.410
- We should be
on the brick road.

02:16.440 --> 02:18.480
- The Wizard's Guards
are on the brick road.

02:18.510 --> 02:20.010
- Yeah, well,
we're moving too slowly.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.700
This rate,
we're never gonna get to...

02:21.740 --> 02:23.510
- Or we might just
keep you alive.

02:27.650 --> 02:29.490
[dog barks]

02:29.520 --> 02:31.560
Your dog's doing
that thing again.

02:31.590 --> 02:32.860
- His name's Toto.

02:32.890 --> 02:36.360
- Does he know that?

02:41.530 --> 02:43.640
Are you sure that coat
belonged to your mother?

02:43.660 --> 02:45.360
- Yes.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.810
K. Chapman.

02:47.840 --> 02:49.070
Karen Chapman.

02:49.100 --> 02:51.500
- Yes, but K could be
for anything.

02:51.540 --> 02:54.610
It could be
for Katherine or Kordelia.

02:57.580 --> 02:59.490
- Cordelia stars with C.

02:59.510 --> 03:02.550
- Look, if you're gonna risk
your life to see The Wizard,

03:02.580 --> 03:05.050
it'd just be nice to know
that you have the right coat.

03:05.090 --> 03:07.630
- Well, don't you want
to see him, too?

03:07.660 --> 03:09.460
Don't you want to find out
who you really are?

03:09.490 --> 03:11.490
- Of course I do.
- Then?

03:11.530 --> 03:14.400
[dog barks]

03:14.430 --> 03:15.830
- What do you want from me?

03:19.730 --> 03:22.370
- Maybe he's just grateful
to have you.

03:28.510 --> 03:30.420
Maybe we both are.

03:33.110 --> 03:36.680
- It's you who saved my life.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.120
- I did, didn't I?

03:38.150 --> 03:40.520
[soft dramatic music]

03:40.550 --> 03:42.550
[dramatic musical sting]

03:42.590 --> 03:45.550
[tense music]

03:50.830 --> 03:53.800
[eerie music]

04:08.450 --> 04:11.560
- It's not easy cleaning up
a massacre.

04:11.590 --> 04:13.560
- Wizard ordered me
to burn down Nimbo.

04:13.590 --> 04:15.890
That's what I did.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.690
- Captain.

04:17.730 --> 04:19.529
I think you'll want to see this.

04:37.850 --> 04:40.620
- Did our men go inside?
- Not yet.

04:40.650 --> 04:42.560
And I'd advise against it.

04:42.580 --> 04:44.150
I will travel
to Nimbo personally

04:44.180 --> 04:45.650
and determine if
this is magic or...

04:45.690 --> 04:47.660
- Couldn't determine
the weather,

04:47.690 --> 04:49.760
could you?

04:49.790 --> 04:50.920
I'll go myself.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.670
- Well, I should at least
be by your side.

04:52.690 --> 04:53.760
You still need counsel.

04:53.790 --> 04:54.960
- Yes...

04:55.000 --> 04:57.970
[tense music]

04:58.000 --> 04:59.910
Just not yours.

05:05.740 --> 05:06.980
[door opens]

05:16.050 --> 05:18.620
- Are you putting me to death?

05:18.650 --> 05:19.950
- To work.

05:22.860 --> 05:24.800
- Can you hear me?

05:28.960 --> 05:30.930
You had a fall.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.560
But we're gonna fix you up.

05:40.940 --> 05:42.570
- [panting]

05:42.610 --> 05:43.970
Tip...

05:44.010 --> 05:45.770
[stammering] Tip, Tip, Tip...

05:45.810 --> 05:47.480
- There is no need
to fight, Jack.

05:47.520 --> 05:50.590
- [stammers] Tip. Tip...

05:55.090 --> 05:57.500
- Breathe.

06:20.610 --> 06:23.980
[machine whirs]

06:24.020 --> 06:26.990
This won't hurt a bit.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.990
[dramatic music]

06:46.340 --> 06:48.580
- These are your stables?

06:48.610 --> 06:50.750
Hey! What was that for?

06:54.780 --> 06:56.880
- Yes, Mistress, come over here.

06:56.920 --> 06:58.560
- Where are we?

06:58.590 --> 07:01.960
- Your new home.

07:01.990 --> 07:04.930
We'll keep her well.

07:05.930 --> 07:07.670
- What are you doing?

07:07.700 --> 07:11.600
- The first thing
you'll need is a proper bath.

07:11.630 --> 07:12.730
- Don't touch me.

07:12.770 --> 07:15.840
- A clean orphan
is a good orphan.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.640
- I'm not an orphan!

07:17.670 --> 07:19.940
- Isn't that right, Mum?

07:19.970 --> 07:21.870
- Baptize her.

07:24.710 --> 07:26.140
- I'm Dorothy.

07:26.180 --> 07:28.150
What's your name?

07:33.950 --> 07:36.820
Are you alone?

07:36.860 --> 07:38.960
Where did you come from?

07:38.990 --> 07:41.660
- She doesn't understand you.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.070
- Well, she may not
understand me,

07:43.100 --> 07:45.800
but she seems to know you.

07:45.830 --> 07:48.100
- Well, at least somebody does.

07:48.140 --> 07:51.040
- But we have to go.
- We can't.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.940
Lucas, I'm not abandoning her.

07:52.970 --> 07:54.800
- What happened
to seeing The Wizard?

07:54.840 --> 07:57.370
What happened to getting home?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.940
- There's a village a walk back,
maybe she's from there?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.086
- You walk into that village,

08:01.110 --> 08:02.680
The Wizard's Guards
will kill you...

08:02.720 --> 08:03.860
- She's alone.

08:03.880 --> 08:06.110
A child alone.
- [Sighs] Yeah.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.080
- Think about her parents.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.650
Wondering where she is,
if she's dead

08:09.690 --> 08:10.966
- or if she's alive...
- Dorothy.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.366
- She's ever gonna come home.
- Dorothy.

08:12.390 --> 08:15.720
She's not you.

08:15.760 --> 08:16.960
We have to move.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.170
- No.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.670
If you want,
you can stay here with Toto.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.100
Stand guard.

08:24.140 --> 08:26.610
But I'm taking her home.

08:38.150 --> 08:41.150
- Hello, Jack.

08:41.190 --> 08:43.760
Did you sleep well?

08:43.789 --> 08:45.750
- Who are you?

08:45.790 --> 08:47.190
- My name is Jane.

08:47.230 --> 08:49.840
- Where's Tip?

08:49.860 --> 08:51.860
- Tip?
- My friend.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.010
- Oh, I'm sorry.

08:54.030 --> 08:56.900
You were quite alone
when we found you.

08:56.940 --> 08:58.210
- That's not possible.

08:58.240 --> 08:59.880
She wouldn't have left me.

08:59.910 --> 09:02.150
- Well, she might have
thought you were dead.

09:02.180 --> 09:03.880
We did.

09:03.910 --> 09:06.740
You were battered and broken
and spilled into the street.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.910
- What have you done to me?

09:07.950 --> 09:11.020
- Well, saved your life,
of course.

09:13.450 --> 09:14.950
It wasn't easy.

09:14.990 --> 09:18.030
And full recovery
will take time.

09:18.060 --> 09:20.830
But...

09:20.860 --> 09:23.230
I think it's safe to say
we've made you a new man.

09:26.270 --> 09:29.840
- [screams]

09:29.870 --> 09:32.840
[ominous music]

09:32.870 --> 09:35.700
[continues screaming]

09:35.740 --> 09:37.270
- [mutters indistinctly]

09:43.320 --> 09:43.460
.

09:44.150 --> 09:46.480
[soft dramatic music]

09:46.520 --> 09:48.460
- Be safe.

09:55.030 --> 09:56.230
- Hey.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.930
Hey, it's okay.

09:57.970 --> 09:59.340
It's okay.

09:59.370 --> 10:00.810
Look, if we don't
find your parents,

10:00.830 --> 10:02.360
I'll bring you
right back to him.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.930
He's watching out for us.

10:18.090 --> 10:21.430
What is this?

10:21.450 --> 10:24.420
[overlapping chatter]

10:24.460 --> 10:27.430
[overlapping animal sounds]

10:27.460 --> 10:30.460
[sounds swell in volume]

10:30.500 --> 10:33.310
- [echoing] Why would anyone...
- [gasps]

10:33.330 --> 10:34.506
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry.

10:34.530 --> 10:36.300
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

10:36.340 --> 10:38.840
[overlapping sounds continue]

10:38.870 --> 10:40.270
[sounds stop]

10:40.310 --> 10:41.980
I'm sorry.

10:56.420 --> 10:59.390
[mystical music]

11:11.440 --> 11:14.410
- If I may?

11:14.440 --> 11:16.400
- You may. Always.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.510
- I thought you were
displeased with me.

11:19.550 --> 11:21.590
- I was.

11:21.610 --> 11:25.450
- Was I wrong to challenge you?

11:25.490 --> 11:27.860
- I'm taking you to Nimbo
because you did.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.030
You were right.

11:32.060 --> 11:35.030
About the Giants.

11:35.060 --> 11:38.090
I can't, uh, bring them back.

11:40.530 --> 11:43.430
- No, even if you
could raise them,

11:43.470 --> 11:45.430
they won't kill
The Beast Forever.

11:48.480 --> 11:51.080
Not this time.

11:51.110 --> 11:52.940
I have studied all the data,

11:52.980 --> 11:55.310
I have pored over all the facts,

11:55.350 --> 11:58.420
and I believe... I feel...

12:00.420 --> 12:02.320
This Beast will come
from the sky.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.630
It will have
a brain and a heart.

12:05.660 --> 12:09.130
It will be possessed
of relentless strength.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.930
- Then I'm already dead.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.960
- No, don't you... don't you see?

12:14.000 --> 12:17.070
If it has a heart,
you can kill it.

12:27.650 --> 12:30.620
[rhythmic drumming]

12:32.020 --> 12:35.090
- [panting]

12:37.220 --> 12:38.590
I can't!

12:38.630 --> 12:40.630
- You have to work
the limbs, Jack.

12:40.660 --> 12:44.430
Before scar tissue forms.
- Please, stop.

12:44.460 --> 12:48.960
- You have to keep moving!
- I don't want this!

12:49.000 --> 12:51.500
You should have left me
in the street.

12:51.540 --> 12:53.580
Like Tip.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.140
You had no right to help me!

13:02.050 --> 13:05.160
- I take on many special
projects for the Royal Army.

13:05.190 --> 13:07.460
This is what they pay me to do.

13:07.490 --> 13:08.660
- So that's what I am?

13:08.690 --> 13:10.660
A project?

13:10.690 --> 13:13.520
- We're all projects, Jack.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.960
All of us with missing pieces
or damaged parts.

13:18.000 --> 13:20.210
You should be grateful
I replaced yours.

13:20.230 --> 13:24.200
- You took out my heart.
- And gave you a new one.

13:24.240 --> 13:27.010
One that will never break.

13:29.040 --> 13:31.170
- That's where you're wrong.

13:34.180 --> 13:38.180
- Today, I offer you a future.

13:38.220 --> 13:40.190
A future of hope.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.950
Of service.

13:41.990 --> 13:45.730
A chance to better yourselves.

13:45.760 --> 13:50.470
Under my tutelage, you shall
join The Wizard's High Council

13:50.500 --> 13:54.010
and protect Oz against
threats from without...

13:54.030 --> 13:56.970
- No! Leave me alone!

13:57.000 --> 13:59.430
- It's all right, my child,
no one wants to harm you.

13:59.470 --> 14:01.040
You're safe here.

14:01.070 --> 14:04.140
- And from within.
- I ain't taking no bath!

14:04.180 --> 14:07.190
[tense music]

14:07.210 --> 14:09.040
I don't belong here!

14:12.620 --> 14:15.230
That man lied to me!
- Oh, I'm sorry, Mistress.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.630
This one's just a little...

14:16.660 --> 14:19.160
- Touch me again,
I'll break your arm!

14:19.190 --> 14:21.590
- It's all right, child.

14:21.630 --> 14:24.670
We only want to help you.

14:27.030 --> 14:30.170
You're alone in this world, yes?

14:30.200 --> 14:32.270
Afraid.

14:32.310 --> 14:34.310
Without options.

14:34.340 --> 14:37.310
Without purpose.

14:37.340 --> 14:41.010
I can give you
all that you seek.

14:41.050 --> 14:43.790
I can give you a family.

14:43.820 --> 14:47.090
- Which is clearly overrated.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.020
- [speaking native language]

14:51.060 --> 14:52.730
- You've come to poach
for your cause,

14:52.760 --> 14:54.630
I've come to poach for mine.

14:54.660 --> 14:56.620
This girl looks like trouble.

14:56.660 --> 15:00.130
And where I come from,
trouble pays.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.100
- I'm afraid not, no.

15:06.140 --> 15:09.780
- Are you sure you haven't heard
of anyone looking for a child?

15:09.810 --> 15:12.080
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

15:12.110 --> 15:14.086
Did you speak with the women
at the boarding house?

15:14.110 --> 15:15.626
- Yeah, and the teacher's
at the school.

15:15.650 --> 15:17.120
I've been everywhere.

15:17.150 --> 15:18.710
- You could try the constable.

15:21.690 --> 15:24.730
Or perhaps you'd rather not?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.720
- Thank you.
Thank you for your help.

15:28.760 --> 15:31.130
- You're welcome.
- Sylvie!

15:31.160 --> 15:34.030
Oh, Sylvie!

15:36.200 --> 15:38.530
They found you.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.700
The butcher said he saw someone
taking her 'round.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.140
- Has she been with you long?

15:44.180 --> 15:45.350
- Just since last night.

15:45.380 --> 15:47.820
- Oh, she adores sweets.

15:47.850 --> 15:50.290
Let's get you some proper food
and a warm bath.

15:53.650 --> 15:55.850
Thank you again.

15:55.890 --> 15:57.160
- Thank you.

15:59.130 --> 16:00.370
- Wait.

16:03.860 --> 16:06.130
I'll come with you.

16:06.170 --> 16:08.310
I would like to see
Sylvie's home.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.680
[ominous music]

16:24.850 --> 16:27.320
- Here we are. Thank you again.

16:27.350 --> 16:30.250
I'd offer you some food, but I'm
afraid we don't have much.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.390
But we make do, don't we, love?

16:34.390 --> 16:36.160
- Where's Sylvie's room?

16:38.400 --> 16:39.770
- I beg your pardon?

16:42.300 --> 16:44.670
- Sylvie's room.

16:44.700 --> 16:46.730
I'd like to see it.

16:46.770 --> 16:48.840
- We have to go.
We have to go. Now!

16:48.880 --> 16:50.186
- Wait! Sylvie...
- We have to go!

16:50.210 --> 16:51.240
Come on!
- [Whimpers]

16:51.280 --> 16:53.720
- Wait! Lucas, stop!

16:53.750 --> 16:55.720
Lucas, those aren't her parents.

16:55.750 --> 16:57.160
We have to go back for her.

16:57.180 --> 16:58.910
- No, The Wizard's Guards
are everywhere.

16:58.950 --> 17:02.420
They'll find you before
we ever find her.

17:02.460 --> 17:04.460
Dorothy. Dorothy!

17:04.490 --> 17:06.790
- Seen a girl?
- None by here, no.

17:16.140 --> 17:18.380
[suspenseful music]

17:19.410 --> 17:21.210
- Anything amiss at all?

17:21.240 --> 17:22.740
- No, no, I ain't seen anything.

17:29.750 --> 17:30.960
Nothing unusual we've seen.

17:30.980 --> 17:32.350
- Seen nothing.

17:38.430 --> 17:40.506
- You shoot that, and everyone
will mark you for a witch.

17:40.530 --> 17:42.370
Do you understand?

17:42.400 --> 17:45.240
- I can take care of myself.
- But you won't, will you?

17:45.270 --> 17:47.240
Because ever since we met,
you rush into things

17:47.270 --> 17:49.310
without a care whether or not
you live or die.

17:49.340 --> 17:52.280
But some of us do care.

17:56.340 --> 17:58.970
- Take off your clothes.

17:59.010 --> 18:00.410
- What?

18:00.450 --> 18:03.760
- You have no business
being here.

18:03.780 --> 18:04.880
- On the contrary,

18:04.920 --> 18:06.760
empowered young women
are my business.

18:06.790 --> 18:09.930
- And you just happened to pick
the exact same orphanage

18:09.960 --> 18:11.960
at the exact same time?

18:11.990 --> 18:13.860
- Coincidence.
- Can I go now?

18:13.890 --> 18:16.420
Both: No.

18:16.460 --> 18:19.460
- Is it not enough that you have
destroyed our reputation?

18:19.500 --> 18:21.470
Sullied our name.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.500
And now you're
going to be so petty

18:23.540 --> 18:26.880
as to challenge me
for these lost girls?

18:26.910 --> 18:28.880
- You're absolutely right.

18:28.910 --> 18:30.556
I shouldn't challenge you.
We should let them

18:30.580 --> 18:31.880
decide for themselves.

18:31.910 --> 18:33.010
What do you say?

18:33.050 --> 18:34.890
- Me?
- Leave her out of this.

18:34.910 --> 18:37.750
- Why? She's exactly
what I'm looking for.

18:37.780 --> 18:40.380
Strong, spirited, vigorous.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.020
- Come with me.

18:46.060 --> 18:49.370
You'll be treated
with the utmost respect.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.570
- Respect, yes. Love, no.

18:52.600 --> 18:55.010
- You'll be untouched. Pure.

18:55.030 --> 18:56.500
Forever and always.

18:56.540 --> 18:59.280
- And I offer you
the chance to feel something.

18:59.310 --> 19:00.510
To make others feel something.

19:00.540 --> 19:04.510
To be worshiped as a courtesan.

19:04.540 --> 19:07.280
- So you're saying
my only choice as a girl

19:07.310 --> 19:10.410
is nun or whore?

19:14.890 --> 19:17.900
- Did I mention we sleep in?

19:27.400 --> 19:30.400
- [grunting softly]

19:30.440 --> 19:32.040
[doors open]

19:32.070 --> 19:35.400
[glass shatters]

19:35.440 --> 19:38.410
[mystical music]

19:46.620 --> 19:48.330
- Boo!
- [gasps]

19:48.360 --> 19:49.460
Jane?

19:49.490 --> 19:51.100
- No.

20:02.940 --> 20:05.110
- Are you like me?

20:05.140 --> 20:07.950
- I'm not like anyone.

20:07.970 --> 20:09.916
- Do you think you could
roll that thing over here?

20:09.940 --> 20:12.570
- I could.
- But?

20:12.610 --> 20:13.940
- I won't.

20:16.620 --> 20:18.490
- Seriously?

20:21.090 --> 20:25.130
- Who will I be today?

20:25.160 --> 20:27.930
- A jackass?

20:27.960 --> 20:30.860
- That was Tuesday.

20:30.900 --> 20:34.570
Perhaps I should be pretty?

20:34.600 --> 20:37.430
People like pretty.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.930
- I think people
generally prefer nice.

20:39.970 --> 20:42.400
- Mice?
- Nice!

20:42.440 --> 20:44.470
- Because from down there,
you might see plenty.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.040
Ha!

20:58.160 --> 20:59.430
Bravo.

20:59.460 --> 21:01.630
One for the freak.

21:01.660 --> 21:03.490
- Excuse me?

21:03.530 --> 21:05.160
- Takes one to know one.

21:13.470 --> 21:16.440
[tense music]

21:19.050 --> 21:20.520
- It's a privilege, sir.

21:20.550 --> 21:22.690
- Just lead on, Captain.

21:22.720 --> 21:25.620
- You burnt our homes!

21:25.650 --> 21:27.080
You burnt our children!

21:27.120 --> 21:29.490
- All right, it's all right!

21:31.120 --> 21:34.190
Okay.

21:34.230 --> 21:36.700
It's all right.

21:36.730 --> 21:40.170
This man here has a grievance.

21:40.200 --> 21:42.570
You've lost someone.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.430
- Her mother.

21:44.470 --> 21:45.600
My wife.

21:48.580 --> 21:50.450
We've all lost someone.

21:50.480 --> 21:52.750
Because of you.

21:55.620 --> 21:57.690
There's no magic here.

21:59.620 --> 22:01.490
- Anna?

22:29.550 --> 22:30.560
[explosion booms]

22:30.580 --> 22:32.150
- [screams]

22:32.180 --> 22:35.050
[all scream and gasp]

22:35.090 --> 22:36.260
- Guards!

22:43.160 --> 22:45.260
Anna? Anna?

22:47.670 --> 22:49.270
Anna.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.270
- It's gone.

23:00.210 --> 23:03.610
[indistinct chatter]

23:03.650 --> 23:06.610
[suspenseful music]

23:11.060 --> 23:13.770
[chickens clucking]

23:15.860 --> 23:17.220
- [knocks]

23:26.340 --> 23:29.110
[panting]

23:30.680 --> 23:34.550
- [ragged breathing]

23:37.880 --> 23:39.550
- Sylvie?

23:55.500 --> 23:57.800
[tense music]

24:00.110 --> 24:01.750
- Did you do this?

24:01.770 --> 24:04.570
Sylvie?

24:04.610 --> 24:05.610
Sylvie, come here.

24:05.650 --> 24:06.880
- [gasping]

24:09.820 --> 24:12.090
- I'm gonna get you
out of here, all right?

24:12.120 --> 24:14.060
We're gonna go back to Lucas.

24:14.090 --> 24:15.790
Okay?

24:32.100 --> 24:34.840
- [whimpers]

24:49.890 --> 24:51.860
- Close your eyes.

24:51.890 --> 24:53.020
Close 'em.

25:06.710 --> 25:10.080
- Do you feel better?

25:10.110 --> 25:13.150
- Be difficult to feel
any worse.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.850
- I thought I'd lost you.

25:18.890 --> 25:22.830
I don't know what
I would have done.

25:22.860 --> 25:25.430
- You have others
to counsel you.

25:25.460 --> 25:27.400
- I've never met
anyone like you.

25:27.430 --> 25:29.230
Not just that, but also...

25:29.260 --> 25:31.730
- Don't.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.000
- You must think me the fool.

25:38.040 --> 25:39.910
- Never.

25:43.780 --> 25:46.080
But I...

25:46.110 --> 25:49.040
I chose this path.

25:49.080 --> 25:52.410
Service over pleasure.

25:52.450 --> 25:55.650
And I cannot stray.

26:00.930 --> 26:03.900
[soft dramatic music]

26:05.870 --> 26:09.710
There may be
other villages like this.

26:09.740 --> 26:13.750
People like the Alderman,
who refuse to follow you.

26:16.280 --> 26:18.480
- Are you suggesting I kill him?

26:18.510 --> 26:20.170
- No.

26:20.210 --> 26:22.240
You'll only make him a martyr.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.810
- Then what?

26:25.850 --> 26:28.050
- You must turn him.

26:52.080 --> 26:53.280
- [sighs]

27:02.820 --> 27:05.850
[gasps]

27:11.860 --> 27:13.830
- You're new, right?

27:16.100 --> 27:19.900
- And hopefully
gone by tomorrow.

27:19.940 --> 27:22.050
- Don't you want to be adopted?

27:22.070 --> 27:24.140
- No.

27:24.180 --> 27:28.090
I just want to disappear,
I just want to forget...

27:28.110 --> 27:30.110
forget everything.

27:30.150 --> 27:32.090
- Maybe Glinda can help you.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.220
Give you a new life.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.780
- Yeah.

27:34.820 --> 27:37.850
I trust her even less
than her sister.

27:37.890 --> 27:39.090
- Wait.

27:39.130 --> 27:41.200
West wanted you, too?

27:41.230 --> 27:43.170
- I don't think she's
that discriminating.

27:43.200 --> 27:45.200
- Oh, but she is.

27:45.230 --> 27:48.000
And if all you want to do
is forget,

27:48.030 --> 27:49.230
she can show you how.

27:49.270 --> 27:51.040
- I don't want
to forget that way.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.900
- Have you ever tried it?
- No.

27:52.940 --> 27:55.910
- It's not so bad
once you get used to it.

27:55.940 --> 27:58.370
And sometimes, it...

27:58.410 --> 28:00.370
it takes away everything else.

28:00.410 --> 28:04.150
Like nothing else exists.

28:04.180 --> 28:07.210
It's the best kind
of forgetting.

28:13.190 --> 28:16.160
[ominous music]

28:25.040 --> 28:28.010
[suspenseful music]

28:42.390 --> 28:46.900
[indistinct chatter]

28:54.970 --> 28:56.140
[horse chuffs]

29:00.970 --> 29:03.300
- My apologies, sir.

29:07.380 --> 29:10.320
So...

29:10.350 --> 29:13.020
the girl who fell from the sky.

29:20.030 --> 29:23.200
[soft dramatic music]

29:23.230 --> 29:26.200
- [panting]

29:33.940 --> 29:35.170
Jane, look at this.

29:35.210 --> 29:37.150
It's working.

29:37.180 --> 29:39.480
I'm working.

29:40.580 --> 29:43.550
- I'm proud of you, Jack.

29:43.580 --> 29:45.980
- You all right?

29:47.090 --> 29:49.390
- There was a girl
in here earlier.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.190
- Yeah.

29:51.220 --> 29:52.920
I was gonna ask you about that.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.130
About her.

29:55.160 --> 29:56.520
- Was she cruel?

29:56.560 --> 29:58.060
- Cruel?

29:58.100 --> 30:00.500
Definitely strange, but...

30:00.530 --> 30:02.500
kind of interesting strange.

30:02.530 --> 30:04.200
Who is she?

30:04.240 --> 30:06.340
- Her name is Langwidere.

30:06.370 --> 30:08.100
- Is she a friend of yours?

30:08.140 --> 30:10.470
- Uh, a client.

30:10.510 --> 30:13.580
I brought you some clothes.

30:16.220 --> 30:20.090
We're going on an outing.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.190
You're moving well.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.350
Fresh air will do you good.

30:26.290 --> 30:29.420
- Are you sure
everything's all right?

30:29.460 --> 30:32.530
- Everything is as I've come
to expect it, Jack.

30:34.030 --> 30:36.160
Full circle.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.070
Here. Here.

30:42.510 --> 30:44.450
Your new world awaits.

31:05.260 --> 31:07.130
- I knew it was you.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.130
In the water.

31:13.170 --> 31:15.600
I knew it was you
the whole time.

31:15.640 --> 31:18.370
You weren't fooling anyone.

31:18.410 --> 31:20.110
- I've heard enough
from my sister.

31:20.150 --> 31:22.150
I don't need any more from you.

31:22.180 --> 31:24.580
- Was anything
you said to me true?

31:26.350 --> 31:28.520
- Every word.

31:28.550 --> 31:31.390
All you need to do
is work for it.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.050
You ready to work?

31:35.460 --> 31:37.220
- I don't want to forget.

31:37.260 --> 31:39.330
Not anymore.

31:39.370 --> 31:41.410
- Well, what do you want?

31:41.430 --> 31:43.130
- Your magic.

31:43.170 --> 31:46.140
[ominous music]

31:50.340 --> 31:53.270
- No magic in Nimbo.

32:01.320 --> 32:03.080
Is that right, Jermiah?

32:07.490 --> 32:10.420
Where did this tunnel lead to?

32:10.460 --> 32:12.630
What was its purpose?

32:12.660 --> 32:16.100
You're the village Alderman.
- I have no village.

32:16.140 --> 32:17.516
- You will answer
with respect, or I'll...

32:17.540 --> 32:19.180
- No, Captain, it's all right.

32:22.310 --> 32:24.680
This man,
he lost the woman he loved.

32:29.480 --> 32:33.310
I feared I'd lost someone today.

32:33.350 --> 32:35.350
Fortunately, she recovered.

32:39.430 --> 32:44.240
Do you know the difference
between science and magic?

32:44.260 --> 32:47.590
- Only that one is a lie.

32:47.630 --> 32:49.660
- Ah. Which one is that?

32:49.700 --> 32:52.500
- Oz is a land of enchantment.

32:52.540 --> 32:55.180
Magic is its heart.

32:55.210 --> 32:59.350
- Yet this enchantment could not
save you from The Beast Forever.

32:59.380 --> 33:02.220
- We did not need to be saved.

33:02.250 --> 33:06.190
The Beast comes because it must.

33:06.220 --> 33:08.690
To cleanse and purify.

33:08.720 --> 33:12.450
This is how it's been forever.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.590
Where was your science
for my wife?

33:15.630 --> 33:18.700
And this village?

33:18.730 --> 33:21.360
Will it save
my future grandchild?

33:26.310 --> 33:28.550
- Excellent question.

33:30.410 --> 33:35.220
- For the crime of murdering the
Mistress of the eastern wood...

33:35.250 --> 33:38.260
by order of the great
and powerful Wizard of Oz...

33:40.320 --> 33:41.730
I commit you to d...

33:52.600 --> 33:54.310
This sword.

33:54.330 --> 33:55.660
I knew the man who carried it.

33:59.410 --> 34:00.680
Where is he?

34:03.610 --> 34:05.650
- We don't know.

34:05.680 --> 34:06.650
[gasps]

34:06.680 --> 34:07.720
- Where is he?

34:10.350 --> 34:13.719
I've been hunting the owner of
this sword for a very long time.

34:13.750 --> 34:17.420
If he's alive,
you will deliver him to me.

34:17.460 --> 34:19.429
- You're scaring her.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.330
- No!
- Oh, no!

34:21.360 --> 34:22.489
- It's okay, it's okay.

34:22.530 --> 34:24.739
- Where is he?

34:27.270 --> 34:28.239
[gunshot]

34:28.270 --> 34:31.210
[all scream and gasp]

34:31.239 --> 34:32.846
If that is your magic,
you better use it on me,

34:32.870 --> 34:35.270
because I will not relent.

34:35.310 --> 34:36.750
- Dorothy!
- Go to Lucas.

34:36.780 --> 34:38.850
[suspenseful music]

34:38.880 --> 34:40.350
- Roan?

34:40.380 --> 34:41.620
- Go. Go!

34:41.650 --> 34:42.620
- Roan!

34:42.650 --> 34:44.260
It's you.

34:44.280 --> 34:46.250
- Stay back. All of you.

34:46.290 --> 34:47.620
- Roan!

34:47.650 --> 34:49.449
- Roan!
- Stay back.

34:49.489 --> 34:50.860
- Roan!

34:50.889 --> 34:53.360
- Roan!
- Please stop!

34:53.389 --> 34:54.690
Stop.

34:54.730 --> 34:56.630
Stop! [Gunshot]

35:11.810 --> 35:14.410
- What happened?

35:14.450 --> 35:15.650
- I shot him.

35:19.850 --> 35:21.550
- Dorothy, he knew me.

35:28.860 --> 35:31.760
[grunting]

35:38.300 --> 35:41.370
Please don't say
we're going to the top.

35:44.780 --> 35:46.380
- One step at a time.

35:46.410 --> 35:49.380
[ominous music]

35:49.420 --> 35:51.790
- [grunting]

36:15.340 --> 36:16.940
Who lives here?

36:16.980 --> 36:19.680
- The King of Ev.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.780
And his daughter.

36:26.450 --> 36:31.390
Jack, this is Lady Ev.

36:31.420 --> 36:33.090
Princess Langwidere.

36:37.130 --> 36:38.700
- Of course you are.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.690
- Thank you, Jane.

36:40.730 --> 36:42.400
That will be all.

36:42.430 --> 36:45.070
- That will be all what?

36:45.100 --> 36:47.730
- I must leave, Jack.

36:47.770 --> 36:50.770
- I'm not staying here, am I?

36:50.810 --> 36:53.450
- I'm afraid you don't
have a choice.

36:53.480 --> 36:56.450
- In case you weren't aware,
you are walking and talking

36:56.480 --> 37:00.010
at the expense of our kingdom.

37:00.050 --> 37:03.720
The least you can do
is offer your gratitude.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.430
- Was that the deal?
Build me, then sell me?

37:06.460 --> 37:09.400
- No.

37:09.430 --> 37:12.370
I'd rather hoped you'd want
to stay in my care.

37:12.400 --> 37:14.040
- Then why are you leaving?

37:14.070 --> 37:17.510
- The princess met you...

37:17.540 --> 37:18.910
she liked you, and...

37:22.810 --> 37:24.920
Now she owns you.

37:24.940 --> 37:27.440
- Owns me?

37:36.420 --> 37:39.490
- You believe she's a witch?
- I don't know.

37:39.530 --> 37:42.970
I don't think she wanted
to hurt those people.

37:42.990 --> 37:44.960
But she obviously
felt threatened.

37:48.000 --> 37:50.140
- What did they want with her?

37:50.170 --> 37:53.480
- In my world, people just prey
on children because they can.

37:55.840 --> 37:57.940
- Is there magic in your world?

38:02.510 --> 38:05.410
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

38:05.450 --> 38:08.520
- Yeah, but it's different.

38:08.550 --> 38:12.150
We have science, and...

38:12.190 --> 38:15.160
technology.

38:15.190 --> 38:17.060
- And what's that?

38:17.100 --> 38:18.940
- You'll see.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.570
Now put this in your ear.

38:25.540 --> 38:27.540
Trust me.

38:37.550 --> 38:39.220
Ready?

38:39.250 --> 38:41.180
- Yeah.

38:41.220 --> 38:45.530
-  Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone

38:45.560 --> 38:47.530
- It's okay. It's okay.

38:47.560 --> 38:52.070
-  It's not warm
when she's away

38:52.100 --> 38:54.040
- Just listen.

38:54.070 --> 38:57.140
-  Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone

38:57.170 --> 39:00.140
 And she's always gone
too long

39:00.170 --> 39:04.910
 Anytime she goes away

39:04.940 --> 39:06.470
- Science.

39:06.510 --> 39:08.510
-  I wonder this time...

39:08.550 --> 39:10.050
- Magic.
-  Where she's gone

39:10.080 --> 39:12.950
["Ain't No Sunshine"
by Bill Withers]

39:12.980 --> 39:16.520
 Wonder if she's gone to stay

39:19.120 --> 39:22.490
 Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone

39:22.530 --> 39:25.240
 And this house
just ain't no home

39:25.260 --> 39:27.830
 Anytime she goes away

39:27.870 --> 39:31.270
- I believe we were mislead.

39:31.300 --> 39:33.970
The magic we put our faith in,

39:34.010 --> 39:36.650
it didn't make us stronger.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.980
We were left to rely on others.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.110
On Witches.

39:41.150 --> 39:44.050
And in the end...

39:44.080 --> 39:46.110
it could not save us.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.620
So...

39:48.650 --> 39:51.990
from this day forward...

39:52.020 --> 39:55.160
I propose...

39:55.190 --> 39:59.160
we embrace the teachings
of The Wizard.

39:59.200 --> 40:02.270
And allow science
to rule the day.

40:02.300 --> 40:05.000
-  Darkness every day

40:07.610 --> 40:10.650
 Ain't no sunshine
when she's gone

40:10.680 --> 40:13.620
 And this house just
ain't no home

40:13.650 --> 40:16.550
 Anytime she goes away

40:19.590 --> 40:22.590
 Anytime she goes away

40:25.360 --> 40:28.670
 Anytime she goes away

40:31.600 --> 40:33.700
 And I know I know
I know I know

40:33.730 --> 40:37.160
 I know I know I know I know
I know I know I know I know

40:37.200 --> 40:40.030
- That man...

40:40.070 --> 40:41.570
he did know you.

40:41.610 --> 40:43.580
- He knew who I was.

40:43.610 --> 40:47.080
-  But ain't no sunshine
when she's gone

40:49.350 --> 40:51.320
The man I am today...

40:51.350 --> 40:52.720
-  When she's gone

40:55.790 --> 40:58.260
- Is who I want to be.

41:01.630 --> 41:04.670
-  Anytime she goes away

41:07.370 --> 41:10.670
 Anytime she goes away

41:19.280 --> 41:23.150
[hoofbeats approaching]

41:23.180 --> 41:24.680
- What is that?

41:24.720 --> 41:27.690
[suspenseful music]

41:28.750 --> 41:30.050
- We have to move.

41:30.090 --> 41:31.760
I'll take the girl. Go.

41:31.790 --> 41:34.090
Go. Go!

41:39.130 --> 41:40.160
Come on.

41:43.300 --> 41:45.300
Come on.

41:50.740 --> 41:52.310
[horse whinnies]

42:14.770 --> 42:16.170
[object whooshing]

42:16.200 --> 42:17.400
[blow landing]
