00:01.322 --> 00:03.483
<i>-Previously on "Shut Eye"...</i>

00:03.484 --> 00:05.405
- You ever use, um...
scopolamine?

00:05.406 --> 00:07.287
-What is that, like mouthwash?

00:07.288 --> 00:09.329
-It's a hypnotic drug.

00:09.330 --> 00:11.171
I blow it in your face,
you empty your bank account.

00:11.172 --> 00:13.693
Don't remember you did it.
It's amazing stuff, really.

00:13.695 --> 00:15.095
You just got to be careful.

00:15.096 --> 00:16.256
-The Drums.

00:16.257 --> 00:18.138
I fucking love The Drums.
- Yeah?

00:18.139 --> 00:20.661
There's this girl at my school,
and... and I kind of like her.

00:20.662 --> 00:22.624
Like, a lot.
- I got something for you.

00:26.948 --> 00:28.268
-You found something.

00:28.269 --> 00:30.310
- Nadine Davies
does not have kids.

00:30.311 --> 00:31.632
-No.

00:31.633 --> 00:33.914
- Then why is she shopping
at toy stores,

00:33.915 --> 00:36.877
going to Little League fields,
and taking school tours?

00:36.878 --> 00:40.040
-That is so sad.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.042
-Tragic.

00:42.043 --> 00:45.166
Potentially.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.329
Everything has to be
in its right place.

00:49.330 --> 00:51.211
Look around.

00:51.212 --> 00:53.574
Anything look like it
might scare Nadine off?

00:53.575 --> 00:56.496
-You're fine.

00:56.497 --> 00:57.898
-Mm.

00:57.899 --> 00:59.860
These crystals.
We're gonna move those.

00:59.861 --> 01:03.744
A little too New Age-y.

01:03.745 --> 01:05.866
-That doesn't feel right.

01:05.867 --> 01:07.668
Don't push.

01:07.669 --> 01:09.510
-I know.

01:09.511 --> 01:11.391
Vicki's doing the research.
She's on her way.

01:11.392 --> 01:13.715
You got the money?
- Mm-hmm.

01:18.680 --> 01:21.201
Look, I know what I'm doing.

01:21.202 --> 01:23.804
If the husband comes home,
we risk losing her,

01:23.805 --> 01:28.168
and I don't know how long
I can hold on to her.

01:28.169 --> 01:29.610
-The drawer for this, right?

01:29.611 --> 01:32.492
- Yeah.
- Mm.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.975
Two weeks' worth of pickups.

01:34.976 --> 01:37.257
- This is an investment
in our future.

01:37.258 --> 01:38.779
It's worth it.

01:41.022 --> 01:44.585
- It's ready.
Come check it out.

01:44.586 --> 01:45.946
- Hey!
- Ha ha!

01:45.947 --> 01:47.788
- Ah, Nick's gonna love this.
- Yeah.

01:47.789 --> 01:49.590
-And if he doesn't, let me know.

01:49.591 --> 01:50.951
I got a half a dozen folks
will give you more

01:50.952 --> 01:52.312
than what you can get on eBay.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.994
- Yeah, we're gonna need
a new sign.

01:53.995 --> 01:55.836
- You want to go
with another classic neon.

01:55.837 --> 01:57.718
The new LEDs are cheaper
and more reliable,

01:57.719 --> 01:59.560
but, to me,
they just don't say "psychic."

01:59.561 --> 02:01.281
- Just get us something
we can put in the window.

02:01.282 --> 02:02.963
-I'm on it.

02:02.964 --> 02:06.167
And, uh, let me know what Nick
says about this beauty.

02:32.594 --> 02:36.637
Maybe an open palm,
some stars, and a moon?

02:36.638 --> 02:38.358
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Shit!

02:38.359 --> 02:40.040
Mom!

02:40.041 --> 02:42.002
Mom!
- Excuse me.

02:42.003 --> 02:44.324
- The whole bottle?
- I can save 'em.

02:44.325 --> 02:46.527
- The whole bottle?
- I can save 'em.

02:46.528 --> 02:48.088
-I'll call Dr. Pearlman.

02:48.089 --> 02:50.090
Just be more careful, honey.

02:50.091 --> 02:51.972
This won't go on the insurance.

02:51.973 --> 02:53.534
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

02:53.535 --> 02:55.495
Be careful.

02:55.496 --> 02:57.899
Go look in your bedroom.
- All right.

03:03.945 --> 03:05.707
-I fuckin' love you, dude.

03:05.947 --> 03:08.309
That is so awesome.

That Gandalf thing is so sick.

04:17.619 --> 04:19.740
- Uh, it's supposed to
be Merlin, Nick.

04:19.741 --> 04:21.622
- Oh, well same difference.
Deep wizard shit.

04:21.623 --> 04:23.904
- Nick.
- I'm late for school.

04:23.905 --> 04:25.986
- Yeah, I'll take you.
We need to talk.

04:29.310 --> 04:32.352
- I'm sorry to be so early,
but there wasn't any traffic.

04:32.353 --> 04:34.795
Actually, I'm always early.
- That's all right. Come on in.

04:34.796 --> 04:36.757
Nadine Davies,
this is my daughter, Vicki.

04:36.758 --> 04:38.919
- Yeah, I introduced myself.
Um, if I could just talk to you

04:38.920 --> 04:40.521
for five minutes
before I go to work...

04:40.522 --> 04:42.122
- Oh, of course.
As, I said, I'm always early.

04:42.123 --> 04:43.644
- Hey, what's up?
I'm just gonna catch the bus.

04:43.645 --> 04:46.006
- Okay.
- We'll talk when you get home.

04:46.007 --> 04:47.487
-Would you mind if I

04:47.488 --> 04:49.129
talk to my daughter
for 10 minutes or so?

04:49.130 --> 04:51.131
My children...
I always indulge them.

04:51.132 --> 04:54.975
-I think that's lovely.

04:54.976 --> 04:57.578
- Nadine, come in.
- Oh, thanks.

04:57.579 --> 04:59.740
- Let me get you a cup
of coffee or some tea?

04:59.741 --> 05:02.223
-Ah, great.

05:05.907 --> 05:08.549
That's quite a setup.

05:08.550 --> 05:10.390
- Charlie's not a snob
about most things,

05:10.391 --> 05:16.637
but when it comes to coffee,
God help me, he is a nightmare.

05:16.638 --> 05:19.920
- Well, I have nothing against
a good cup of coffee.

05:19.921 --> 05:21.922
-How old's your daughter?

05:21.923 --> 05:25.766
- She's Charlie's daughter
from his first marriage.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.529
Afraid I'm the other woman.

05:30.812 --> 05:32.452
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

05:32.453 --> 05:34.254
It's... It's healing fine.
No damage.

05:34.255 --> 05:35.936
- Well, not that.
You just seem...

05:35.937 --> 05:37.377
-I'm good. Let's go, let's go.

05:37.378 --> 05:39.259
- Okay, well, this is
what I got so far.

05:39.260 --> 05:41.381
You want more,
I can "drone" her backyard.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.023
- Drone?
- Yeah, it's no big thing.

05:43.024 --> 05:45.465
Uh, bank accounts...
Joint with her husband.

05:45.466 --> 05:48.669
Investment portfolio...
Impressive, well-managed.

05:48.670 --> 05:50.671
And then there's this
one Citibank account.

05:50.672 --> 05:52.232
-Shh, shh, shh.

05:52.233 --> 05:54.795
Um, she opened it 33 years ago,

05:54.796 --> 05:58.478
put $50,000 a year in
for the next 12 years.

05:58.479 --> 06:00.080
Since then,
it remained untouched,

06:00.081 --> 06:07.407
accruing away... $1,773, 480.18
as of last quarter.

06:07.408 --> 06:10.691
You smelled it.

06:10.692 --> 06:14.414
She had a kid when she was 17.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.577
Put him up for adoption.

06:16.578 --> 06:18.138
And her search history?

06:18.139 --> 06:20.140
Been lookin' at
a lot of middle schools.

06:20.141 --> 06:22.503
- For a kid who's 30?
- Bingo.

06:22.504 --> 06:24.384
See, here she
is sitting quietly,

06:24.385 --> 06:27.628
listening to people talk
in a survivor-guilt chat room.

06:27.629 --> 06:31.431
So, I come in, talk about a kid
I had that I put up for adoption

06:31.432 --> 06:34.635
and found out he died
and I was devastated.

06:34.636 --> 06:37.118
And there she is.

06:41.202 --> 06:44.605
- He died when he was 13?
- 12.

06:44.606 --> 06:48.569
You want to see a picture?

06:48.570 --> 06:50.611
-You get a name?

06:50.612 --> 06:52.172
-I got two.

06:52.173 --> 06:53.814
- You know why Charlie
wanted to see me?

06:53.815 --> 06:56.537
- Oh, when it comes to
the business, it is all him.

06:56.538 --> 06:58.058
I mean, like I said
when we first met,

06:58.059 --> 06:59.339
I'm really just a housewife.

06:59.340 --> 07:00.541
-Mm.

07:00.542 --> 07:02.022
- Linda giving you
Dad's coffee rap?

07:02.023 --> 07:03.744
- Water just below boiling,
coffee weighed.

07:03.745 --> 07:05.265
- Hey.
- I like a ritual.

07:05.266 --> 07:06.787
-And I like good coffee.

07:06.788 --> 07:08.268
- Any left?
- Yeah, I'll make you a cup.

07:08.269 --> 07:09.790
- Do you want to come
into the office?

07:09.791 --> 07:11.311
You can bring your coffee
if you like.

07:11.312 --> 07:12.953
- Would it be insulting
to ask for sugar?

07:12.954 --> 07:14.795
- Ooh.
- A little bit.

07:14.796 --> 07:16.797
But I'm handling it.

07:16.798 --> 07:19.439
All I ask is
that you try it first,

07:19.440 --> 07:23.483
and then, if you still want
to sweeten it up...

07:23.484 --> 07:26.047
I don't want to be disturbed
under any circumstances.

07:29.811 --> 07:31.732
I hope you weren't expecting
a crystal ball

07:31.733 --> 07:33.453
or anything like that.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.255
- Tell you the truth, I don't
know what I was expecting.

07:35.256 --> 07:37.658
I do use tarot cards
from time to time,

07:37.659 --> 07:40.581
not because I honestly believe
that the order

07:40.582 --> 07:42.783
in which you turn over the cards
can reveal anything

07:42.784 --> 07:45.305
about your future
or your spiritual life,

07:45.306 --> 07:46.827
because I do believe

07:46.828 --> 07:49.149
that they can
be powerful symbols

07:49.150 --> 07:52.793
in unlocking certain
characteristics

07:52.794 --> 07:54.795
in both participants
in a reading.

07:54.796 --> 07:57.998
- Is what this is going to be,
a reading? I mean, I thought...

07:57.999 --> 07:59.840
Well, you called and said
it was important,

07:59.841 --> 08:03.844
and, well, I imagined it was
about the Gypsies.

08:03.845 --> 08:07.007
- That's for you.
It's $5,000.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.328
-I don't understand.

08:08.329 --> 08:10.170
-Well, I told you I knew a cop.

08:10.171 --> 08:13.373
The Roma... They tend to have
big, extended families.

08:13.374 --> 08:14.895
He dug something up...

08:14.896 --> 08:17.858
Well, a few things about
your psychic's cousins

08:17.859 --> 08:19.540
and what they were involved in.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.141
Guys drive around supermarkets

08:21.142 --> 08:23.504
telling people they can repair
the dents in their cars.

08:23.505 --> 08:25.145
Sometimes
they steal their money,

08:25.146 --> 08:26.947
and sometimes
they steal their cars.

08:26.948 --> 08:28.869
Anyway, we convinced her
to take $15,000

08:28.870 --> 08:30.831
and go back to Ohio
with her cousins

08:30.832 --> 08:32.753
and never come back.

08:32.754 --> 08:34.193
You're never gonna
be bothered again.

08:34.195 --> 08:36.236
-I-I can't thank you enough.

08:36.236 --> 08:37.999
-It was my pleasure, believe me.

08:41.442 --> 08:44.765
- You know, I'm sorry that
someone as obviously open

08:44.766 --> 08:47.728
and curious as you are had
the experience you had.

08:47.729 --> 08:49.770
- Sorry.
Oop.

08:49.771 --> 08:52.533
I'm actually, as a rule,
not all that gullible.

08:52.534 --> 08:54.575
- But you don't seem to
automatically expect

08:54.576 --> 08:56.216
the worst in others.

08:56.217 --> 08:58.458
- Uh, that sounds like
a line from a reading.

08:58.459 --> 09:01.061
-That is a Barnum statement.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.944
It's a broad statement
that can be true of anybody.

09:03.945 --> 09:05.225
-Thanks.

09:05.226 --> 09:06.987
- It's a popular tool
in mentalism,

09:06.988 --> 09:08.589
that sort of magic.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.831
- Linda said that you were
a magician.

09:10.832 --> 09:14.595
How did you, um, switch teams?

09:14.596 --> 09:17.157
- Oh, that's a bit of a story.
- I'm curious.

09:17.158 --> 09:20.160
- My dad died when I was five.
- I'm so sorry.

09:20.161 --> 09:22.843
-For me, it was what it was.

09:22.844 --> 09:26.086
But it broke my mother's heart.

09:26.087 --> 09:31.091
She visited a-a woman
who claimed to be a psychic.

09:31.092 --> 09:34.214
She told her my father
was nearby,

09:34.215 --> 09:36.857
trying to warn her
that she was in danger,

09:36.858 --> 09:38.418
and she was in danger,
all right.

09:38.419 --> 09:40.781
The psychic took her
for everything...

09:40.782 --> 09:44.024
All her savings,
the deed to our trailer.

09:44.025 --> 09:46.507
I mean, we lived on the street
for almost a year.

09:46.508 --> 09:47.788
-That's terrible.

09:47.789 --> 09:49.389
-Oh, it got worse.

09:49.390 --> 09:52.232
She dove headfirst into a
vodka bottle and never came out.

09:52.233 --> 09:56.436
I was 14, and my sister
was 10 when she died.

09:56.437 --> 09:58.158
- So, Dad said to mention,
in case it comes up,

09:58.159 --> 09:59.520
he's going with the, uh...

09:59.521 --> 10:01.522
The "trailer park/bad
psychic" story,

10:01.523 --> 10:03.684
not the one where
his mom has lymphoma.

10:03.685 --> 10:04.965
-Yeah, I-I figured.

10:04.966 --> 10:06.647
Trailer park's
a little more real.

10:06.648 --> 10:09.489
- You ever notice how,
in both stories, Grandpa dies?

10:09.490 --> 10:11.972
- I think that's called
wish fulfillment.

10:11.973 --> 10:13.814
Did you want more?
I can make more.

10:13.815 --> 10:15.536
-No, I got to go to work.

10:15.537 --> 10:18.179
Can't start doggin' it until
they realize I'm invaluable.

10:23.384 --> 10:25.265
Good luck with that.

10:25.266 --> 10:29.309
- Linda told me that you
actually were, well, psychic.

10:29.310 --> 10:34.675
- Sometimes, I have intuitions
that are helpful.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.157
Sometimes, the cards
can be helpful.

10:37.158 --> 10:38.679
But I don't know.

10:38.680 --> 10:41.642
I mean, maybe it's just
a question of focus.

10:41.643 --> 10:45.365
- You must be the world's
most self-deprecating psychic.

10:45.366 --> 10:48.889
- Well, I'm just glad
that you're safe, Nadine,

10:48.890 --> 10:52.173
and that we were able to get you
some of your money back.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.097
- Uh, the other day,
when you were at my house,

10:57.098 --> 10:59.900
you stopped and said
that you had, um...

10:59.901 --> 11:02.382
a feeling.
Was that this intuition?

11:02.383 --> 11:05.866
- Just for a moment,
I-I felt a presence.

11:05.867 --> 11:08.468
It could've been that,
or maybe it's just the situation

11:08.469 --> 11:09.790
you're in with the Gypsies.

11:09.791 --> 11:12.472
-There's that self-deprecation.

11:12.473 --> 11:14.074
Could you...

11:14.075 --> 11:16.957
Do you think
that you could, um...

11:16.958 --> 11:18.478
find it again?
- Find it?

11:18.479 --> 11:20.040
-The presence you felt.

11:20.041 --> 11:23.483
I mean, you said
sometimes the cards...

11:23.484 --> 11:27.367
-Oh.

11:27.368 --> 11:29.370
You want me
to give you a reading.

11:35.416 --> 11:37.497
-Well, no surprise here.

11:37.498 --> 11:40.060
This card represents
strife, competition,

11:40.061 --> 11:42.743
feeling beat up, under attack...

11:42.744 --> 11:45.265
You know, like when someone
pulls down a tree

11:45.266 --> 11:47.387
and leaves a rooster
with a crown on its head

11:47.388 --> 11:49.029
in your bedroom to scare you.

11:49.030 --> 11:51.111
-Mm.

11:51.112 --> 11:52.633
-The three of cups.

11:52.634 --> 11:54.835
Abundant life, long term,

11:54.836 --> 11:58.559
surrounded by good food
and wine, good friends.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.120
Sometimes, as I said,

12:00.121 --> 12:02.643
the tarot just tells us
what we already know.

12:02.644 --> 12:04.605
- I'm actually more
of a beer person.

12:04.606 --> 12:06.446
-To be honest, so am I.

12:06.447 --> 12:08.847
When these things were made,
they were probably talking mead.

12:09.811 --> 12:11.211
-Mm.

12:11.212 --> 12:13.574
- What?
- This, uh...

12:13.575 --> 12:15.576
This is the cheaters card.

12:15.577 --> 12:20.541
Someone is taking something,
being sneaky, unfaithful,

12:20.542 --> 12:23.784
acting without integrity.

12:23.785 --> 12:26.266
Your husband's business trips...

12:26.267 --> 12:28.028
-Didn't take a psychic.

12:28.029 --> 12:30.230
- Well, as I said,
sometimes the cards

12:30.231 --> 12:32.873
just tell you
what you already know.

12:37.198 --> 12:40.280
- Surprise.
- What are you doing here?

12:40.281 --> 12:43.804
- I got you something.
Charlie's not home?

12:43.805 --> 12:46.648
- Charlie's with a client.
He's not to be disturbed.

12:58.820 --> 13:02.102
- One time, in high school,
I went home with this guy.

13:02.103 --> 13:04.625
I mean, he took me to his place.
It was his parents' place.

13:04.626 --> 13:06.426
They were out of town.

13:06.427 --> 13:08.348
So, we're doing it
in his parents' bedroom.

13:08.349 --> 13:10.871
I mean, we're trying.
He's a kid.

13:10.872 --> 13:12.633
You know how boys get.

13:12.634 --> 13:16.837
So I whisper in his ear,
"This is your parents' bed.

13:16.838 --> 13:20.480
We're doing it
in your parents' bed."

13:20.481 --> 13:24.685
He gets rock hard,
and we fuck for hours.

13:24.686 --> 13:26.486
Sometimes, if there was a lull,

13:26.487 --> 13:29.089
I just had to remind him
where we were.

13:29.090 --> 13:32.372
- Good to know.
- Take me to your room.

13:32.373 --> 13:34.254
You said he's with a client.

13:34.255 --> 13:36.737
- You may find this hard
to believe...

13:36.738 --> 13:40.020
I have boundaries.
You just crossed one.

13:40.021 --> 13:42.543
- It'd be hot.
- No doubt.

13:42.544 --> 13:44.385
You said you
had something for me?

13:49.190 --> 13:51.031
-Scopolamine.

13:51.032 --> 13:52.954
That drug I told you about.

13:54.996 --> 13:59.239
I think it could be
really helpful in your work.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.882
You're a pushy person.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.524
Anyone ever tell you that?

14:03.525 --> 14:05.966
-Who, me?

14:05.967 --> 14:08.408
I'm all sweetness, all the time.

14:10.411 --> 14:14.254
- Try that on one of your
"valued customers."

14:14.255 --> 14:15.656
It works.

14:15.657 --> 14:19.059
Maybe you'll realize
how invaluable I can be.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.461
Oh, and I would divvy it up
if I were you.

14:21.462 --> 14:24.666
Like I said, too much...
Not a good thing.

14:28.950 --> 14:32.152
- You said you wanted
to go to my room?

14:32.153 --> 14:34.675
- Yeah.
You changing your mind?

14:34.676 --> 14:36.316
-Well, I was just wondering.

14:36.317 --> 14:40.160
You've got this stuff,
you know how well it works.

14:40.161 --> 14:41.802
Why not just dose me?

14:41.803 --> 14:44.364
We'd be in there right now,
under my sheets.

14:44.365 --> 14:47.447
-The thought crossed my mind.

14:47.448 --> 14:51.011
Seriously, it did.

14:52.574 --> 14:56.537
It's gonna sound like
a Hallmark card, but...

14:56.538 --> 14:59.100
I wanted it to mean something.

15:00.782 --> 15:04.545
Try that shit out on someone.

15:04.546 --> 15:08.789
It's fucking amazing.

15:08.790 --> 15:12.553
And come see me...

15:12.554 --> 15:15.717
soon.

15:57.478 --> 16:00.241
- Excuse me, ma'am.
I think these are yours.

16:02.524 --> 16:05.646
Charlie said you like my car,
so you know what?

16:05.647 --> 16:07.728
It's yours.

16:07.729 --> 16:10.571
- Eduardo, I don't...
I mean...

16:10.572 --> 16:14.855
- You have no idea
how easy it is for me to do this

16:14.856 --> 16:20.821
and how much Charlie
has helped my family and me.

16:20.822 --> 16:22.262
You okay?

16:22.263 --> 16:23.664
-Yeah, I'm just a little tired.

16:23.665 --> 16:25.385
-Nothing a new car can't fix.

16:25.386 --> 16:27.708
- I mean...

16:27.709 --> 16:29.269
This is unbelievable.

16:29.270 --> 16:31.431
- Drive it around the block.
You'll believe it.

16:33.274 --> 16:34.795
Where's my boy?
I want him to see this.

16:34.796 --> 16:37.758
- Oh, he's with a client.
- Uh-huh.

16:37.759 --> 16:39.600
-Let me see if I can interrupt.

16:39.601 --> 16:41.121
- No, no.
If, uh...

16:41.122 --> 16:44.885
If he's helping someone,
God bless him.

16:44.886 --> 16:46.286
How's he doing?

16:46.287 --> 16:49.610
You know, his head...
everything else?

16:49.611 --> 16:51.131
- He's good.
- Okay.

16:51.132 --> 16:52.613
- He's fine actually.
- All right, well,

16:52.614 --> 16:53.894
you let me know what he says

16:53.895 --> 16:55.656
when he comes out
and sees this puppy.

16:55.657 --> 16:57.297
- I don't know what to say.
- Look, all you got to say is,

16:57.298 --> 17:01.942
"You're welcome."
The thank you is all me.

17:01.943 --> 17:05.345
Oh, uh...

17:05.346 --> 17:07.067
don't get pulled over.

17:07.068 --> 17:12.193
The pink slip, chain of
title... questionable at best.

17:17.959 --> 17:21.080
- Oh.
Uh...

17:21.082 --> 17:24.204
This is a serious card.
- What does that mean?

17:24.204 --> 17:28.488
- Uh, this card speaks
of willing victimhood

17:28.489 --> 17:30.731
to something that
you're not looking at.

17:30.732 --> 17:33.173
To be honest, I-I don't see
this card often,

17:33.174 --> 17:34.855
and it worries me a little.

17:34.856 --> 17:37.257
-Worries you?

17:37.258 --> 17:38.979
- Well, you seem to have
come to terms

17:38.980 --> 17:41.101
with your husband's infidelity.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.984
But I'm wondering if there's
something else in your life

17:43.985 --> 17:46.187
you haven't come to terms with.

17:49.991 --> 17:51.913
-Turn the next card.

17:58.199 --> 17:59.479
-Okay.

17:59.480 --> 18:02.563
Uh, this is the card
of motherhood.

18:02.564 --> 18:03.964
-Motherhood.

18:03.965 --> 18:06.206
- Uh, the Empress...
She sits in a garden

18:06.207 --> 18:10.691
with ultimate compassion
and unconditional love.

18:10.692 --> 18:13.454
It's a very powerful card.

18:15.817 --> 18:19.900
Ca-Can you help me understand
what this means?

18:19.901 --> 18:21.421
-This, um...

18:21.422 --> 18:24.184
I can't go down
another psychic rabbit hole.

18:24.185 --> 18:25.706
I appreciate what you've done
with the...

18:25.707 --> 18:27.508
With the Gypsies
and all of that,

18:27.509 --> 18:29.710
but I've done enough of this.
- Uh, that's fine.

18:29.711 --> 18:31.552
We don't...
We don't have to continue.

18:31.553 --> 18:32.913
-I mean, what is a pack of cards

18:32.914 --> 18:34.675
gonna tell me
about my life, anyway?

18:34.676 --> 18:38.358
- Well, I-I think
the better question would be,

18:38.359 --> 18:42.122
what can you learn
from the answer?

18:42.123 --> 18:44.124
- What if it's something
I don't want to know?

18:44.125 --> 18:45.846
- Well, you can't...
I mean, I can put these cards

18:45.847 --> 18:47.528
back into the deck,

18:47.529 --> 18:51.852
but you can't just walk away
from what they're saying.

18:51.853 --> 18:55.616
I mean, they'll
always haunt you.

18:55.617 --> 18:58.979
What did you see
in these last two cards?

18:58.980 --> 19:00.701
Okay, I'll tell you what.

19:00.702 --> 19:03.744
What I'm gonna do is I will
put these last three cards

19:03.745 --> 19:06.627
in an envelope here in my desk,

19:06.628 --> 19:10.151
and they'll be here
if you change your mind.

19:15.957 --> 19:22.082
-No.

19:22.083 --> 19:23.604
Turn it over.

19:23.605 --> 19:26.527
-Are you sure, Nadine?

19:26.528 --> 19:29.010
-I am.

19:34.896 --> 19:38.218
- The mother and now
the child in a garden.

19:38.219 --> 19:41.101
Abandoned.

19:41.102 --> 19:43.625
Left alone.

19:46.828 --> 19:49.350
-Keep going.

19:53.394 --> 19:56.717
-Justice reversed.

19:56.718 --> 20:00.682
Something very unfair happened,
something that was not right.

20:08.329 --> 20:10.811
Tower reversed.

20:10.812 --> 20:14.454
Something tore your world apart.

20:14.455 --> 20:18.418
F-for no good reason.

20:29.831 --> 20:35.716
What happened to that child,
Nadine?

20:35.717 --> 20:38.599
-Oh, God.

20:38.600 --> 20:42.002
I'm so sorry.

20:42.003 --> 20:45.125
Oh, God.

21:07.148 --> 21:08.428
- and then if you're
gonna be like that,

21:08.429 --> 21:09.990
he can't surprised
when somebody,

21:09.991 --> 21:11.552
like, turns around
and kicks your ass, you know?

21:11.553 --> 21:14.034
- Seriously.
- You know, is that...

21:14.035 --> 21:15.956
Oh.
- Oh. Hey, Mom.

21:15.957 --> 21:17.157
I thought you were going out.

21:17.158 --> 21:19.199
-I thought you were in school.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.081
-We just got sent home.

21:21.082 --> 21:24.004
Mr. Jacobson... uh,
he got the flu or something,

21:24.005 --> 21:25.966
so it's terrible.

21:25.967 --> 21:27.968
Emma.

21:27.969 --> 21:29.289
- Hi.
- My mom.

21:29.290 --> 21:30.931
- Nice to meet you,
Mrs. Haverford.

21:30.932 --> 21:32.813
- Mrs. Haverford's
my husband's mother.

21:32.814 --> 21:34.294
I'm Linda.

21:34.295 --> 21:35.616
Is he bullshitting me
about the half day?

21:35.617 --> 21:37.217
- Well, I mean,
there was an assembly

21:37.218 --> 21:39.900
that we were supposed to go to
if we didn't have class.

21:39.901 --> 21:43.423
Uh, I'm a sophomore, though,
so, honestly,

21:43.424 --> 21:45.105
I'm... I'm in more trouble
than he is.

21:46.748 --> 21:48.428
Do you mind if I talk to Nick
for a minute?

21:48.429 --> 21:50.230
- Mm? Mm-hmm.
- Just wait in the second.

21:50.231 --> 21:52.072
-Oh, sure, Mrs.... uh, Linda.

21:52.073 --> 21:54.395
Dude, Gandalf is so dope.

21:59.080 --> 22:03.483
- Nice.
Sophomore?

22:03.484 --> 22:04.965
-I really like her.

22:04.966 --> 22:07.247
- You messing anything up
in school, missing a day?

22:07.248 --> 22:09.009
I know I keep saying this,

22:09.010 --> 22:11.011
but this is when your grades
start to count for college.

22:11.012 --> 22:13.934
-Mom, I got this, really.

22:13.935 --> 22:16.096
-What's the story here?

22:16.097 --> 22:17.457
- Oh, it's not weed,
if that's what you think.

22:17.458 --> 22:19.660
- I know what oregano
smells like.

22:19.661 --> 22:22.102
Weed, too.

22:22.103 --> 22:24.865
- I got it from Fonso.
- Fonso?

22:24.866 --> 22:26.346
-Yeah, he... he said, um,

22:26.347 --> 22:29.229
it was some kind
of love potion or something.

22:29.230 --> 22:33.473
- You really do like this girl.
- A lot, yeah.

22:33.474 --> 22:35.877
- She ditched school with you.
Maybe this stuff's working.

22:38.159 --> 22:42.122
Tonight, we're gonna talk about
your little Adderall scam.

22:42.123 --> 22:45.005
You're gonna explain to me
why you ground up Vitamin C

22:45.006 --> 22:48.969
and what you do with your pills.

22:48.970 --> 22:51.492
I'll send your girlfriend in.

22:56.818 --> 22:58.819
- I hope you don't mind me
coming over.

22:58.820 --> 23:01.221
I, uh... I just remember
when I was a freshman,

23:01.222 --> 23:02.823
it was all kind of scary,

23:02.824 --> 23:05.546
and Nick is so sweet
and shy, and I just...

23:05.547 --> 23:07.908
- I'm just happy
he's making friends.

23:07.909 --> 23:09.670
- He said that your husband's
a psychic.

23:09.671 --> 23:11.111
That's so awesome.

23:11.112 --> 23:12.833
All my dad is
is just a lawyer... my mom, too.

23:12.834 --> 23:14.955
- Sometimes, a lawyer's
exactly what you need.

23:14.956 --> 23:18.999
- Honestly, it's like a bad
'90s sitcom at my house.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.721
-Nick's in his bedroom.

23:20.722 --> 23:23.443
You can help yourself
to anything in the fridge.

23:23.444 --> 23:24.765
My husband's in with a client,

23:24.766 --> 23:26.607
so if you guys
can just watch the noise.

23:26.608 --> 23:28.729
- Yeah, sure.
Um, thanks.

23:28.730 --> 23:31.051
And don't worry
about his schoolwork.

23:31.052 --> 23:33.494
Nothing happens
freshman year anyways.

23:36.978 --> 23:38.579
-I was 17.

23:38.580 --> 23:41.261
My family is Catholic.

23:41.262 --> 23:42.863
Abortion was not an option.

23:42.864 --> 23:44.224
-And the father?

23:44.225 --> 23:47.548
- Oh, he was at SC
in his freshman year.

23:47.549 --> 23:48.869
I honestly
didn't like him enough

23:48.870 --> 23:50.831
to drag him back into it,

23:50.832 --> 23:54.795
so I told my family I
didn't know who the father was.

23:54.796 --> 23:58.358
- How'd that go?
- Ugh.

23:58.359 --> 24:00.641
It was all very old school.

24:00.642 --> 24:04.645
My mother arranged
a trip to Europe.

24:04.646 --> 24:07.528
And I went to
a private facility in Ojai.

24:07.529 --> 24:11.331
The baby was put up
for adoption.

24:11.332 --> 24:14.255
My father didn't speak to me
for the rest of high school.

24:17.939 --> 24:21.742
I went back East to college,
and he died, uh, my junior year.

24:21.743 --> 24:24.384
- But you've never stopped
thinking about your child.

24:24.385 --> 24:27.307
- No.
No.

24:27.308 --> 24:29.069
-Your mom seems chill.

24:29.070 --> 24:30.871
-Yeah.

24:30.872 --> 24:33.714
- Uh, so if...
- Oh, right.

24:33.715 --> 24:35.796
Sorry.
Uh, this is 70.

24:35.797 --> 24:37.197
I told my mom
I got the whole thing wet,

24:37.198 --> 24:38.999
showed her some goo.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.522
She called me in a refill, so
90 more by next week, hopefully.

24:41.523 --> 24:44.124
-That's genius.

24:44.125 --> 24:46.607
Can we, uh, play some music
or something

24:46.608 --> 24:48.168
if we keep it super-soft?

24:48.169 --> 24:50.490
- Yeah, yeah.
- Uh, can I see your...

24:50.491 --> 24:52.132
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
Sorry.

24:52.133 --> 24:54.255
Uh, here you go.

24:56.938 --> 25:00.180
- Dude, have you heard
Gods Wisdom?

25:00.181 --> 25:02.863
Uh, there's, like,
a ton of really weird rap,

25:02.864 --> 25:04.104
like, coming out
of Western Massachusetts.

25:04.105 --> 25:06.787
- I'm, uh...
I'm just gonna lie down.

25:06.788 --> 25:08.148
-Okay.

25:08.149 --> 25:14.996
Yeah, we'll be quiet.
- Thanks, honey.

25:21.122 --> 25:23.123
-Yeah, uh, if she's lying down,

25:23.124 --> 25:25.085
that means we got
to be extra quiet.

25:25.086 --> 25:27.087
- Do you think it's just
that growing up sucks?

25:27.088 --> 25:28.849
That's kind of my theory.

25:28.850 --> 25:30.531
When you're a kid, everyone
tells you what to do, right?

25:30.532 --> 25:32.292
Like, somebody's always
flying the plane.

25:32.293 --> 25:35.736
Growing up is you walk up to the
cockpit and there's no pilot.

25:35.737 --> 25:38.058
- That sounds about right.
- Because what your dad does,

25:38.059 --> 25:40.460
that's really what
it's all about, right?

25:40.461 --> 25:43.063
I mean, like, people
are looking for a pilot.

25:43.064 --> 25:44.585
- Absolutely.
- I don't know.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.867
I-I used to really resent
my parents for that,

25:46.868 --> 25:48.428
like, them
telling me what to do.

25:48.429 --> 25:50.030
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

25:50.031 --> 25:51.712
and then, last year,
school sucked, like, super-hard,

25:51.713 --> 25:53.874
and I was getting kind of
too heavy into benzos,

25:53.875 --> 25:56.156
and I ran away twice...
Like, once to Santa Barbara,

25:56.157 --> 25:57.918
and then another time
to Riverside,

25:57.919 --> 26:00.280
which is really not
where anybody wants to wind up.

26:00.281 --> 26:01.842
Um, but...
- But you came back.

26:01.843 --> 26:03.083
-Well, I got brought back.

26:03.084 --> 26:04.565
- Oh.
- But, um, I don't know.

26:04.566 --> 26:07.007
Something happened
the second time...

26:07.008 --> 26:09.810
And this is gonna
sound super-corny...

26:09.811 --> 26:13.333
It was the way my dad said
my name when he saw me,

26:13.334 --> 26:15.415
like he thought he was
never gonna see me again.

26:15.416 --> 26:18.859
And then there I was,

26:18.860 --> 26:20.701
and I was like,
"These are people who love me,

26:20.702 --> 26:23.824
no matter what else they are,
no matter what else I do."

26:23.825 --> 26:24.945
-I get that.

26:24.946 --> 26:26.707
-And then I was like,

26:26.708 --> 26:30.871
"I've got, what, four,
three more years now?

26:30.872 --> 26:32.352
What's bad about being
a kid a little longer?"

26:32.353 --> 26:33.994
-So you're not...

26:33.995 --> 26:37.518
You're not thinking about
running away anytime soon.

26:37.519 --> 26:39.279
-I'm here for the duration.

26:39.280 --> 26:42.242
-That's cool.

26:42.243 --> 26:46.206
-We can hook up if you want.

26:46.207 --> 26:48.529
- Yeah.
Sure.

26:48.530 --> 26:50.651
Okay.

26:50.652 --> 26:53.014
- Do you have anything?
- Um...

26:55.617 --> 26:57.337
Just the Adderall.

26:57.338 --> 26:59.540
-No, I meant protection.

26:59.541 --> 27:01.381
- Oh.

27:01.382 --> 27:04.665
Uh...

27:04.666 --> 27:08.469
Uh...
No.

27:10.231 --> 27:11.311
I ran out.

27:12.914 --> 27:16.517
You are so cute.
I mean, like, really.

27:21.523 --> 27:22.883
- I mentioned that
I had this dream

27:22.884 --> 27:25.766
the other night...
Very fragmented.

27:25.767 --> 27:27.207
You were in it.

27:27.208 --> 27:31.532
There was bleachers
and sounds of children

27:31.533 --> 27:36.897
playing baseball,
the smell of candy.

27:36.898 --> 27:39.540
Jelly beans, I think.

27:39.541 --> 27:42.503
Horrible, senseless loss.

27:42.504 --> 27:44.424
And I-I heard a name.

27:44.425 --> 27:47.387
It was a Mark
or Mike, uh, Miles.

27:47.388 --> 27:48.989
Miles.

27:48.990 --> 27:50.390
But then I heard Dylan.

27:50.391 --> 27:51.912
No.

27:51.913 --> 27:55.035
I named him Miles...

27:55.036 --> 27:57.519
My baby.

28:00.682 --> 28:03.043
- Mom, I'm going out.
I'll be right back.

28:10.211 --> 28:13.093
♫♫

28:13.094 --> 28:18.258
- ♫... open eyes watch
the moonflower bloom ♫

28:18.259 --> 28:26.259
♫ It's been a long, hard,
20-year summer vacation ♫

28:27.108 --> 28:29.189
♫ All these 20 years... ♫

28:29.190 --> 28:31.552
-When I came back from college,

28:31.553 --> 28:35.275
I was at a loss
what to do with myself.

28:35.276 --> 28:37.317
Tried therapy, medication.

28:37.318 --> 28:40.561
And eventually, with the help
of a private detective,

28:40.562 --> 28:43.644
I-I found my son,
where he lived.

28:43.645 --> 28:45.285
-And you saw him?

28:45.286 --> 28:50.411
- Well, I'm not really proud
of this, but I, um...

28:51.853 --> 28:54.975
I would follow the family
when they went out...

28:54.976 --> 28:59.499
Would take pictures sometimes.

28:59.500 --> 29:04.505
They lived in La Cañada, so they
went to Descanso Gardens a lot.

29:04.506 --> 29:10.991
I have those pictures.
A boy in a garden.

29:10.992 --> 29:14.515
Like the card.

29:14.516 --> 29:17.038
They called him Dylan.

29:50.391 --> 29:58.118
♫ Went to your room thinking
maybe you'll feel something ♫

29:58.119 --> 30:05.165
♫ But all I saw
was your burning body waiting ♫

30:05.166 --> 30:10.090
♫ All these 20 years
on a vacation ♫

30:10.091 --> 30:13.373
- Score.

30:13.374 --> 30:19.179
- ♫ Crack baby, you don't know
what you want ♫

30:19.180 --> 30:23.864
♫ But you know
that you had it once ♫

30:23.865 --> 30:28.468
♫ And you know
that you want it back ♫

30:28.469 --> 30:33.634
♫ Crack baby,
you don't know what you want ♫

30:35.517 --> 30:38.358
- ♫ But you know
that you're needing it ♫

30:38.359 --> 30:43.724
♫ And you know
that you need it bad ♫

30:43.725 --> 30:45.365
♫ Crack baby, you... ♫

30:49.370 --> 30:51.291
- Uh, it's nothing.
It's...

30:51.292 --> 30:55.055
You know these Valley houses...
They're cracker boxes.

30:55.056 --> 30:59.500
You want to tell me the rest?
- Sure, um...

31:06.147 --> 31:09.711
-♫ You know I can be found ♫

31:14.475 --> 31:17.799
♫ I'm sittin' home all alone ♫

31:22.764 --> 31:26.167
♫ If you can't come around ♫

31:31.212 --> 31:35.176
♫ At least on the telephone ♫

31:47.028 --> 31:49.790
-♫ You know that you want it ♫

31:49.791 --> 31:53.313
♫ You know that you want it ♫

31:53.314 --> 31:56.476
♫ You know that you want it ♫

31:56.477 --> 31:58.599
♫ Crack baby,
you don't know what you want ♫

32:22.463 --> 32:26.426
- Okay.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.756
Shit.

32:42.804 --> 32:46.086
- I was beginning to think
you guys were shining me on.

32:46.087 --> 32:48.408
- Was just doing some cleaning.
- Ah.

32:48.409 --> 32:51.052
You never struck me
as the domestic type.

32:54.616 --> 32:55.696
Hmm.

32:55.697 --> 32:57.658
Charlie around?

32:57.659 --> 32:59.459
-He's with a client.

32:59.460 --> 33:02.863
- Yeah, judging by the car
in the driveway, a rich client.

33:02.864 --> 33:05.466
- All-day session.
- Hmm.

33:08.790 --> 33:10.911
Well, can I come in?

33:10.912 --> 33:13.233
-No. You can't.

33:13.234 --> 33:16.316
Where's the hospitality?

33:16.317 --> 33:19.199
-I am fucking furious at you.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.602
-What? About Sylvia?

33:21.603 --> 33:23.283
-No.

33:23.284 --> 33:25.285
You gave my son a candle
and a baggie full of oregano

33:25.286 --> 33:28.368
and told him
it was a fuckin' love spell.

33:28.369 --> 33:31.491
- Hey, what was I
supposed to do, huh?

33:31.492 --> 33:33.373
Kid comes over all lovelorn.

33:35.577 --> 33:37.738
I was doing
my "Uncle Fonso" best.

33:37.739 --> 33:39.499
-Yeah, well, the last thing

33:39.500 --> 33:43.143
I need he starts believing
in this crap, Uncle Fonso.

33:45.667 --> 33:47.748
We got people here.

33:47.749 --> 33:50.070
They're just doing
the repairs after the shooting.

33:50.071 --> 33:52.753
- You got damage in the kitchen?
- They're here.

33:52.754 --> 33:56.597
Might as well just
get what I can out of 'em.

33:56.598 --> 33:59.159
- I don't see any trucks
or anything.

33:59.160 --> 34:02.202
- It's just one guy.
He's doing some cabinets.

34:02.203 --> 34:04.044
I think his kid dropped him off.

34:04.045 --> 34:05.285
-Hi, there.

34:05.286 --> 34:06.567
Hope this isn't a bad time.

34:06.568 --> 34:08.969
I, uh, brought a peace offering.

34:10.411 --> 34:12.371
I brought a...
- No, I'm, uh...

34:12.373 --> 34:14.214
I'm just
in the middle of something.

34:14.215 --> 34:16.056
-Oh.

34:16.056 --> 34:17.978
Yeah, well, I saw that, uh,
your window was being repaired

34:17.978 --> 34:21.181
and all that, and I thought
it'd look pretty nice under it.

34:21.181 --> 34:22.583
-Hmm.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.824
-That's a good-looking rose.

34:24.826 --> 34:27.306
- Well, it is now,
but you got to deadhead it.

34:27.308 --> 34:28.629
-Deadhead?

34:28.630 --> 34:31.190
What's that mean again?

34:31.192 --> 34:34.393
- Well, you got to cut it way
back till it looks dead.

34:34.395 --> 34:36.996
That's how you get
the real good blossoms.

34:36.998 --> 34:38.358
-Sacrifice.

34:38.359 --> 34:41.562
Now, that's something
I can understand.

34:41.563 --> 34:43.804
You know a lot about roses?

34:43.804 --> 34:45.324
- Oh, yeah.
It's like a passion of mine.

34:48.610 --> 34:51.652
I could come back sometime,
show you how to do it...

34:51.652 --> 34:53.453
The deadheading, I mean.

34:53.454 --> 34:55.495
- That'd be great.
Really.

34:55.496 --> 34:57.698
And thank you.

34:57.699 --> 34:58.899
-Gary.

34:58.900 --> 35:01.702
- Right. Gary.
Right.

35:01.703 --> 35:03.704
Yes.

35:03.705 --> 35:04.985
- Okay.
All right.

35:04.986 --> 35:07.148
Um... okay.

35:15.717 --> 35:18.559
-So, you had any repercussions?

35:18.560 --> 35:22.242
- What do you mean?
- This drive-by.

35:22.243 --> 35:26.967
I'm having a little trouble
with those douchebags...

35:26.968 --> 35:31.572
Pardon me... in the South Bay.

35:31.573 --> 35:33.974
-You think that's who it was?

35:33.975 --> 35:36.056
-That's why I came by,

35:36.057 --> 35:40.340
make sure you guys
hadn't had any more trouble.

35:40.341 --> 35:44.424
-We're fine.

35:44.425 --> 35:47.748
-Well, I'll keep an eye on out.

35:47.749 --> 35:50.030
And, uh...

35:50.031 --> 35:56.637
sorry about
the love-charm thing.

35:56.638 --> 35:58.398
I didn't know what else to do.

36:03.925 --> 36:06.086
Hard to get good help
these days, huh?

36:06.087 --> 36:07.608
-Mm.

36:07.609 --> 36:10.050
-Why don't you go see

36:10.051 --> 36:13.093
how badly this guy's
fucked up your cabinets,

36:13.094 --> 36:14.935
tell Charlie that I came by,

36:14.936 --> 36:19.540
and that I hope everything works
out with Nick and that girl.

36:19.541 --> 36:27.541
He seemed real crazy about her.

36:50.692 --> 36:51.932
-God.

36:51.933 --> 36:54.736
Fuck.

37:12.353 --> 37:15.035
- I watched him grow up
from a distance.

37:15.036 --> 37:17.678
His first day of preschool,
I was across the street...

37:17.679 --> 37:20.881
Watched him walk in,
carry his little lunchbox.

37:20.882 --> 37:25.005
Grammar school,
birthday parties in the park.

37:25.006 --> 37:28.969
You said bleachers.
He played Little League.

37:28.970 --> 37:31.291
I would go to the games.

37:31.292 --> 37:34.054
I'd buy him presents...
Toys, video games.

37:34.055 --> 37:38.418
I saw him eat jelly beans,
so I would get those.

37:38.419 --> 37:42.142
I-I never spoke
with him or anything.

37:42.143 --> 37:45.305
I just left the presents
on the seats.

37:45.306 --> 37:46.867
-And your husband...

37:46.868 --> 37:49.070
- Oh, he never knew
anything about it.

37:52.554 --> 37:56.917
-There's more.

37:56.918 --> 37:59.560
-He was 12.

37:59.561 --> 38:02.042
And I knew he hadn't been
to school for a while,

38:02.043 --> 38:04.925
wasn't playing ball.

38:04.926 --> 38:09.049
I was parked across the street
from his home,

38:09.050 --> 38:10.851
and he came out
with his parents.

38:10.852 --> 38:15.295
He was very thin.

38:15.296 --> 38:17.579
And he'd lost all his hair.

38:21.583 --> 38:24.626
That was
the last time I saw him.

38:40.802 --> 38:43.363
Oh.
I am so sorry.

38:43.364 --> 38:45.526
I have taken up your whole day.

38:45.527 --> 38:46.727
I don't even know
how that happened.

38:46.728 --> 38:48.529
- Please, stop.
It's what I do.

38:48.530 --> 38:52.052
And if you ever want to come
back for cards or anything...

38:52.053 --> 38:54.134
Just to talk...
I'm here for you.

38:54.135 --> 38:55.856
-Well, thank you.

38:55.857 --> 38:57.257
And thank you for helping me

38:57.258 --> 39:01.421
with my... my problem
and all that.

39:01.422 --> 39:04.184
I mean, you can see now
why I was such easy pickings.

39:04.185 --> 39:07.067
- Well, y-you're an open
and a caring person,

39:07.068 --> 39:09.430
and there's nothing
to be ashamed of.

39:11.553 --> 39:13.674
I really appreciate you
doing this, Charlie.

39:13.675 --> 39:14.995
And thank you for listening.

39:14.996 --> 39:17.237
- Like I said, it's what I do.
- Hey.

39:17.238 --> 39:18.559
-Hey, yourself.

39:18.560 --> 39:20.360
Uh, Mrs. Davies,
this is my son, Nick.

39:20.361 --> 39:21.802
Nick,
this is Mrs. Davies.

39:21.803 --> 39:23.283
- Hey, great Dad
you've got here, Nick.

39:23.284 --> 39:24.765
- Yeah.
I thought you said

39:24.766 --> 39:26.046
you were gonna be busy
for a little while.

39:26.047 --> 39:27.287
-Yeah, I'm just finishing up.

39:27.288 --> 39:28.609
Uh, hey,
I'm gonna go to the market.

39:28.610 --> 39:30.651
Do you want pork chops?
- Uh...

39:30.652 --> 39:32.733
Yeah, I think
we might have company.

39:32.734 --> 39:35.856
- Weston?
- No, Emma... my friend.

39:35.857 --> 39:37.818
I think she might be a vegan.

39:37.819 --> 39:39.900
- Well, then I'll make
a big salad.

39:39.901 --> 39:41.181
I'll walk you out.
- Oh.

39:41.182 --> 39:43.544
Nice meeting you, Nick.
- Yeah.

39:43.545 --> 39:46.027
You, too.

39:52.794 --> 39:55.796
Emma, shit.
I'm so sorry about...

39:55.797 --> 39:58.279
Emma?

40:00.882 --> 40:02.883
-Just a normal deck of cards.

40:02.884 --> 40:05.886
Put it in the wine glass.

40:05.887 --> 40:07.968
And I will take
the top card off.

40:07.969 --> 40:09.650
What is that, six of diamonds?

40:09.651 --> 40:13.814
Magically, it disappears.

40:13.815 --> 40:16.456
- It's good, right?
- Yeah, it's good, yeah.

40:16.457 --> 40:18.138
- You want to see how it's done?
- Sure.

40:18.139 --> 40:22.663
-Okay.

40:24.586 --> 40:30.430
Hey, hon.
We're in here.

40:30.431 --> 40:32.152
All right.

40:32.153 --> 40:34.595
There's a pork chop
on the stove if you're hungry.

40:34.596 --> 40:36.116
-Great. Thanks.

40:36.117 --> 40:39.159
- Hey, did you see Emma
before she left?

40:39.160 --> 40:40.881
-No, honey.

40:40.882 --> 40:44.925
- I think, uh, she has cold feet.
- Cold feet?

40:44.926 --> 40:46.567
- Well, he comes racing
into the house

40:46.568 --> 40:49.289
with a bag from the drugstore...
A little bag.

40:49.290 --> 40:50.290
-Ah.

40:50.291 --> 40:51.692
-Hey, guys, Th-this is so wrong.

40:51.693 --> 40:54.294
- You want to see
something else wrong?

40:54.295 --> 40:58.458
While you were in with Nadine,
Eduardo stopped by.

40:58.459 --> 40:59.780
Left a little something.

40:59.781 --> 41:02.462
- Someone gave you a BMW?
- Mm-hmm.

41:02.463 --> 41:05.265
Satisfied client
of your father's.

41:05.266 --> 41:08.308
We're gonna have to do
a little explaining to Fonso.

41:08.309 --> 41:10.110
He stopped by to see
how you were doing.

41:10.111 --> 41:12.472
I kind of let him think that
the car belonged to your client.

41:12.473 --> 41:15.676
- We'll tell them that, uh,
we took over her lease.

41:15.677 --> 41:19.680
-How did it go with Nadine?

41:19.681 --> 41:23.003
- I think I may be
of great help to her.

41:23.004 --> 41:24.645
-Wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:24.646 --> 41:26.366
Why do we have to lie
to Uncle Fonso

41:26.367 --> 41:28.008
about where you got a car?

41:28.009 --> 41:30.090
- Fonso has some Old World ideas
about some things.

41:30.091 --> 41:32.132
- Gypsy shit?
- Mm.

41:32.133 --> 41:34.815
- You sure Emma
didn't say anything?

41:34.816 --> 41:36.296
Because I've been texting her
since I got home,

41:36.297 --> 41:39.019
and I get nothing.
She's not on Facebook.

41:39.020 --> 41:42.302
- Well, maybe that, uh,
love charm didn't work.

41:42.303 --> 41:43.864
-Love charm?

41:43.865 --> 41:46.667
- Our son went over
to Fonso for a little help.

41:46.668 --> 41:48.669
Like most Gypsy shit,
it didn't work.

41:48.670 --> 41:51.832
-Cut it out.

41:51.833 --> 41:55.517
I'm gonna be in my room.

41:59.681 --> 42:02.963
- Let's get back to the fact
that we have a new BMW.

42:02.964 --> 42:05.365
- Guess you want
to take a ride, huh?

42:05.366 --> 42:07.809
-I do.

42:16.898 --> 42:19.219
What?

42:19.220 --> 42:22.623
- Nothing.
I'm...

42:22.624 --> 42:26.227
I was just thinking we really
should redo these cabinets.

42:30.672 --> 42:38.238

42:38.239 --> 42:41.723

43:13.795 --> 43:16.357
It's just a bad dream.
