03:20.466 --> 03:24.854
I hear there's a lot
of dead bodies and zero leads.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.856
We're still processing
the crime scene.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.225
When we have that information,
I'll let you know.

03:29.325 --> 03:32.295
How many victims? Do you have any leads?

03:32.395 --> 03:34.564
Slow down, slow down.

03:34.664 --> 03:36.904
We're getting reports that
there are multiple survivors.

03:36.899 --> 03:40.303
Can you confirm that?

03:40.403 --> 03:42.705
We'll be releasing
those details when we're ready.

03:42.805 --> 03:46.776
Is it true you discovered cameras
at the scene of the crime?

03:46.876 --> 03:48.716
As soon as we have answers,
I'll let you know.

03:48.711 --> 03:50.280
Next question.

03:54.284 --> 03:56.252
...can you explain that?

03:56.352 --> 03:57.554
As you know,

03:57.654 --> 03:59.455
from the record
of this department,

03:59.555 --> 04:01.524
we will not stop
until justice is served.

04:01.624 --> 04:04.194
That's all
we have time for.

04:04.294 --> 04:08.198
We'll release more information later.

04:08.298 --> 04:10.466
When we know more,
you'll know more. Thank you.

04:10.566 --> 04:12.635
That's all for now,
folks, thanks for coming.

04:12.735 --> 04:16.738
There'll be another press conference later.
Thank you very much.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.909
I wanna watch these videos.
What have we got on those bodies?

04:20.009 --> 04:22.729
- Explosion corrupted half the forensics.
- Okay, what about I.D.'S?

04:22.445 --> 04:24.681
Can't tell if the ones we do
have are male or female.

04:24.781 --> 04:26.632
- Well, figure it out.
- Yes, ma'am.

04:29.869 --> 04:31.069
Jesus.

04:32.455 --> 04:35.992
- Go home, Reese. You're on leave.
- I want on the case.

04:36.092 --> 04:38.728
I have enough on my plate.
I can't deal with your baggage.

04:38.828 --> 04:40.630
Baggage. Is that
what you're calling it?

04:40.730 --> 04:42.465
- I can help.
- We're doing fine.

04:42.565 --> 04:44.634
- Yeah, 'cause Gabe called--
- you're not ready.

04:44.734 --> 04:45.935
I spent three years
in the v.U.

04:46.035 --> 04:47.670
I practically
wrote the manual.

04:47.770 --> 04:50.306
You're not ready.

04:50.406 --> 04:53.458
You need me.
You know what I can do.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.465
Alex...

05:01.984 --> 05:04.369
I need this.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.564
Cavalry's arrived.

05:14.664 --> 05:16.733
What's the eta
on the capture?

05:16.833 --> 05:19.836
Reese, thought I was gonna
have to do this one on my own.

05:19.936 --> 05:22.438
I got your back.
Where we at with the video?

05:22.538 --> 05:24.007
Capture complete
in five minutes.

05:24.107 --> 05:26.376
- How many hours are there?
- About three.

05:26.476 --> 05:27.910
Formats?

05:28.010 --> 05:29.445
Four cameras,

05:29.545 --> 05:31.314
but the fire damage
is glitching the video.

05:31.414 --> 05:32.882
I think it's
slowing down the capture.

05:32.982 --> 05:34.884
Next time, copy it
to the hard drive

05:34.984 --> 05:36.719
before the server,
it's faster.

05:36.819 --> 05:38.488
Right. Yeah. Yes, sir.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.523
Update on
our survivor?

05:40.623 --> 05:42.959
Still unresponsive.
Third-degree burns,

05:43.059 --> 05:45.859
massive lacerations to the head and neck.
I got a uniform standing by.

05:45.895 --> 05:48.335
- The other one still with psych?
- There were two survivors.

05:48.064 --> 05:50.224
Looking for some answers,
but it's gonna take a while.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.669
Testimony after trauma
like this is useless anyway.

05:52.769 --> 05:56.906
Witnesses lie,
the camera doesn't.

05:57.006 --> 05:58.941
Capture's complete.
Popcorn's hot.

05:59.041 --> 06:01.611
- Let's hope they caught something.
- They better have.

06:01.711 --> 06:03.546
We got a pile of
dead bodies out there.

06:03.646 --> 06:06.049
These videos could be
the best evidence we've got.

06:06.149 --> 06:08.367
Okay. Do it.

06:29.672 --> 06:31.974
...is the man that holds
the power of God.

06:32.074 --> 06:35.026
That is true greatness.

06:38.097 --> 06:40.583
Oh, that wasn't
good, was it?

06:43.152 --> 06:44.687
Is it too much?

06:44.787 --> 06:47.390
I can't tell.
I'm a terrible actor.

06:47.490 --> 06:49.525
Leann, if I was watching it,
I'd eat it up, so...

06:49.625 --> 06:51.625
- Really?
- Literally. I would totally believe it.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.695
Good. Then we got it.

06:52.795 --> 06:54.497
You promised me
at least--

06:54.597 --> 06:56.833
no, no, leann.
You said at least five.

06:56.933 --> 06:59.068
You said...
All right, all right.

06:59.168 --> 07:00.768
Hold on.

07:03.806 --> 07:06.576
It's beautiful.
What are you playing there?

07:06.676 --> 07:08.544
What's it called?

07:08.644 --> 07:11.663
- It's called--
- shit! Put it down!

07:23.593 --> 07:25.393
Surprise!

07:26.596 --> 07:28.796
Oh, my God!

07:30.032 --> 07:32.001
I can't believe
you got the part.

07:32.101 --> 07:33.870
Oh, my God!

07:33.970 --> 07:36.005
You're a shining star.

07:36.105 --> 07:37.974
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

07:38.074 --> 07:41.077
A little late,
but better late than never, right?

07:41.177 --> 07:43.513
Did you do this?

07:43.613 --> 07:45.982
Yeah. All single-handedly,
I might add.

07:46.082 --> 07:47.784
Oh, really?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.936
Oh, my God,
this is amazing, you guys.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.834
Leann, you look
beautiful.

08:04.934 --> 08:08.137
Such a nice light.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.222
It's perfect.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.776
What are you
thinking about?

08:13.876 --> 08:14.676
Huh?

08:15.978 --> 08:20.082
That just two years ago,

08:20.182 --> 08:22.218
I was back home
in Kansas,

08:22.318 --> 08:25.521
working at my dad's
flower shop.

08:25.621 --> 08:28.124
I remember dreaming
of this moment.

08:28.224 --> 08:30.059
Being up on the stage

08:30.159 --> 08:32.195
was all I ever
thought about.

08:32.294 --> 08:35.063
All those acting classes...

08:35.164 --> 08:37.232
Then you
met me.

08:37.332 --> 08:39.034
Now look at us.

08:39.135 --> 08:41.537
I mean, you're filming
this documentary,

08:41.636 --> 08:45.541
and if this play
goes well, this could be it.

08:45.641 --> 08:48.911
What's the matter
then?

08:49.011 --> 08:51.247
- Leann?
- Hmm?

08:51.347 --> 08:55.051
- Give me that.
- No, no, no.

08:55.151 --> 08:57.253
Last time,
you nearly broke it.

08:57.353 --> 09:00.022
Okay, fine. Hi.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.991
- Hi, Rachel.
- Hello, everyone.

09:02.091 --> 09:03.693
Oh, is little
director shy?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.761
- A little bit.
- Oh, but you're so cute.

09:05.861 --> 09:08.965
You're so annoying.
Nobody wants to see me.

09:09.065 --> 09:10.933
Oh, wow!
Don't get that close.

09:11.033 --> 09:13.202
I see something
on your head.

09:13.302 --> 09:15.771
There's all kinds of
disasters happening here.

09:15.871 --> 09:17.673
Please let me just
film you again,

09:17.773 --> 09:19.675
because you're what
everybody cares about.

09:19.775 --> 09:21.677
No, but you're
so frickin' cute.

09:21.777 --> 09:23.713
Compromise. We'll both
get in there, okay?

09:23.813 --> 09:26.115
At least
you're in it.

09:26.215 --> 09:28.718
Even though I look like a
goddamn goblin next to you.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.120
Okay, so, America,

09:31.220 --> 09:33.556
are you ready...
Oh, God.

09:33.656 --> 09:35.291
For the story of
leann hookplat...

09:35.391 --> 09:37.693
From the girl
next door...

09:37.793 --> 09:41.046
To America's...

09:47.353 --> 09:49.305
Okay,
what's the deal?

09:49.405 --> 09:52.808
The fire corrupted
a lot of the video.

09:52.908 --> 09:56.746
Okay, fast-forward it to the truck yard.
That's all that matters.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.981
No, no, no.

09:59.081 --> 10:01.841
- We need to see the details, the relationships.
- It's not relevant.

10:01.183 --> 10:04.202
- It doesn't matter.
- Everything on this tape matters.

10:07.873 --> 10:09.859
You heard him.

10:09.959 --> 10:11.176
All right.

10:15.781 --> 10:20.236
The truth had cut me like
the grim reaper's blade itself.

10:20.336 --> 10:22.905
Any man who wields
the power of life and death

10:23.005 --> 10:25.608
is a man that holds
the power of God.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.910
That is true greatness.

10:28.010 --> 10:30.580
And though life
may be short,

10:30.680 --> 10:32.582
and death sudden,

10:32.682 --> 10:35.166
true greatness
lasts forever.

10:45.011 --> 10:48.097
Oh, my God! There's
my little superstar.

10:48.197 --> 10:50.166
Did you like it, really?

10:50.266 --> 10:52.466
Of course. Look, I've got goosebumps.
I'm proud of you.

10:52.435 --> 10:54.837
Do you think any of
this footage is gonna be good?

10:54.937 --> 10:57.373
Are you kidding?
This is gonna be a priceless documentary.

10:57.473 --> 10:59.742
You're gonna be
really famous.

10:59.842 --> 11:02.278
Rach, you and me are gonna
make a movie together one day.

11:02.378 --> 11:04.814
Just you and I.
It's gonna be a masterpiece.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.434
Get back out there. Take another bow.

11:06.949 --> 11:10.086
- You gonna film it?
- Of course. Don't be stupid.

12:15.851 --> 12:18.921
Say yes!

12:19.021 --> 12:21.023
What are you doing?

12:21.123 --> 12:23.059
I'm asking you
to marry me.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.995
- What?
- Leann.

12:26.095 --> 12:28.330
No, I can't.

12:33.953 --> 12:37.822
- Tyler, I'm... Ty...
- No, I'm fine.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.784
Just talk to him,
I guess.

12:48.884 --> 12:52.470
I'll make sure
that it gets to him, okay?

12:55.908 --> 12:57.908
Hi, Tyler.

12:58.527 --> 13:01.363
I tried to call you,

13:01.463 --> 13:03.099
and Rachel said
you would watch this,

13:03.199 --> 13:06.168
so... I'm sorry.

13:06.268 --> 13:08.137
You just,
you caught me off-guard,

13:08.237 --> 13:10.372
and I panicked.

13:10.472 --> 13:11.272
I...

13:12.842 --> 13:17.012
I didn't know
what else to do.

13:17.112 --> 13:18.814
Um... hi.

13:18.914 --> 13:20.816
I really think that
you should come,

13:20.916 --> 13:23.152
and I simply can't
take no for an answer.

13:23.252 --> 13:25.421
This is supposed to be
our big celebration.

13:25.521 --> 13:29.291
I think it would be a real
shame to waste these tickets.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.927
Um... I don't know.

13:32.027 --> 13:36.165
I think we've got the room,
we've got the bus.

13:36.265 --> 13:39.902
It'll all be
really fun.

13:40.002 --> 13:42.471
I think you'll forget
about it in an instant,

13:42.571 --> 13:45.141
and I know
she's really sorry.

13:45.241 --> 13:46.208
She's been
really boring.

13:46.308 --> 13:48.344
Um, please come.

13:48.444 --> 13:52.181
I promise I'll be more tolerant of your singing,

13:52.281 --> 13:55.166
which I find
really hard, but okay.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.303
Um, look,

14:01.090 --> 14:03.225
I know you probably
hate me,

14:03.325 --> 14:05.194
and I don't blame you,

14:05.294 --> 14:07.797
but this trip just
won't work without you.

14:07.897 --> 14:10.065
Please come.

14:10.165 --> 14:11.565
Just...

14:12.301 --> 14:15.838
I'm not ready
for marriage right now,

14:15.938 --> 14:19.208
but maybe I will be...
One day.

14:19.308 --> 14:21.993
I still love you.

14:25.164 --> 14:26.515
You gonna film this?

14:26.615 --> 14:29.018
Yeah, I've gotta
film everything.

14:29.118 --> 14:30.853
That was
the deal, remember?

14:30.953 --> 14:32.855
But if he doesn't come,
I look like a loser.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.195
Leann, that's the whole point
of documentary filmmaking.

14:35.224 --> 14:37.259
You've gotta get everything.
We had a deal.

14:37.359 --> 14:39.595
I guess he still has time to make it,
do you think?

14:39.695 --> 14:41.096
Not as much time
as you'd think.

14:41.196 --> 14:43.399
Oh, he looks
friendly, doesn't he?

14:43.499 --> 14:45.334
Yeah.

14:45.434 --> 14:47.469
Do you know
what time it is?

14:47.569 --> 14:50.139
Here's the luxury vehicle we've been supplied.

14:50.239 --> 14:52.608
- Oh, hello.
- Travel in style.

14:52.708 --> 14:55.077
Is there gonna be
a problem?

14:55.177 --> 14:57.246
It's a camera,
not a gun.

14:57.346 --> 15:00.282
I'm gonna grab these.
We gotta get on. Running late.

15:00.382 --> 15:03.352
- Tyler's here.
- Ooh, is that him?

15:03.452 --> 15:05.052
Perfect.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.543
Mmm, he looks
jolly.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.466
Fantastic.

15:17.566 --> 15:20.536
Oh, he brought
his guitar. Great.

15:20.636 --> 15:24.188
Well, viva Las Vegas,
everybody.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.477
Hi, Tyler.
Oh, charming.

15:28.577 --> 15:32.030
Here is the happy,
happy couple.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.486
Does she have
to be here?

15:37.586 --> 15:39.355
Can you turn
that thing off?

15:39.455 --> 15:41.290
Hi. I don't know
if we've met before,

15:41.390 --> 15:43.025
but I'm Rachel.
And I like to film things.

15:43.125 --> 15:46.462
Incredibly uncomfortable
things, so, no.

15:46.562 --> 15:49.632
I said I was sorry,
all right?

15:49.732 --> 15:52.935
I showed up,
didn't I?

15:53.035 --> 15:56.405
Yeah, but can't we just go
back to the way things were.

15:56.505 --> 15:57.905
Please.

16:02.995 --> 16:05.347
Huh. All right,
well, I guess

16:05.447 --> 16:09.018
I'll just cut this part out then.
That's fine.

16:09.118 --> 16:11.020
You can't fix this
with editing.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.222
I can fix anything
with editing.

16:13.322 --> 16:15.925
You know what?
Just because he doesn't wanna have fun

16:16.025 --> 16:18.027
doesn't mean that we
can't have fun for him.

16:18.127 --> 16:19.461
Exactly.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.630
- No. No fun ever.
- Ever.

16:21.730 --> 16:24.633
- Ever.
- Ooh, time to meet the cast.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.370
She's cute.

16:28.470 --> 16:30.239
First stop.

16:38.097 --> 16:41.317
- What are you doing?
- I'm filming.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.052
Vicki, where are you
from originally?

16:43.152 --> 16:44.520
From Russia.

16:44.620 --> 16:46.388
- What brings you here?
- I'm dancing.

16:46.488 --> 16:48.457
Cool. You look
like a dancer.

16:48.557 --> 16:50.192
I love your camera.

16:50.292 --> 16:52.127
My son, he would like
something like this.

16:52.227 --> 16:53.395
Is it heavy?

16:53.495 --> 16:55.680
It's actually
not that heavy.

16:58.550 --> 17:02.004
Hello. It's actually got
really good quality picture,

17:02.104 --> 17:04.239
so it's worth
the weight.

17:04.339 --> 17:05.708
I'll take it back.

17:05.808 --> 17:07.710
He skateboards.

17:07.810 --> 17:11.213
Him and his friends
always take pictures and stuff.

17:11.313 --> 17:13.715
So what's this for again?

17:13.816 --> 17:17.419
Um, it's for my friend back there, leann,

17:17.519 --> 17:19.253
who is gonna be a ultra-famous movie star,

17:19.354 --> 17:21.357
and it's kinda like
one of those

17:21.457 --> 17:23.459
"before they were famous"
type shows.

17:23.559 --> 17:25.527
Do you have that
in Russia?

17:25.627 --> 17:27.762
- Before they were stars?
- I love the show, yeah.

17:27.863 --> 17:31.133
Yeah. We're
all fans.

17:31.233 --> 17:34.003
Including you,
Tyler.

17:34.103 --> 17:37.439
So Vicki, tell us more about this
show you're auditioning for.

17:37.539 --> 17:39.508
It's the new cirque
extravaganza.

17:39.608 --> 17:42.077
Oh, wow, you must be
so thrilled.

17:42.177 --> 17:44.580
I'm a pisces,

17:44.680 --> 17:47.149
so this is like
the universe and the stars

17:47.249 --> 17:49.251
are perfectly aligned
to give me the job.

17:49.351 --> 17:50.652
I was born for it.

17:50.752 --> 17:52.621
It's my dream.

17:52.721 --> 17:55.157
That's great.
Very exciting.

17:55.257 --> 17:57.526
Ooh, is that
a present I can see?

17:57.626 --> 17:59.528
Is it your
birthday?

17:59.628 --> 18:00.796
No. It's my son's.

18:00.896 --> 18:03.132
What'd you
get him?

18:03.232 --> 18:05.234
I'm sorry,
it's personal.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.752
Oh, it's okay.

18:09.421 --> 18:11.789
- Should we cut?
- Yeah, all right.

18:26.872 --> 18:29.173
Got another one.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.764
He looks
quite sweet.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.335
- Hi.
- Hey.

18:40.435 --> 18:41.804
- Say hello.
- Hello.

18:41.904 --> 18:43.572
- What's your name?
- Steven.

18:43.672 --> 18:45.674
- Where you from?
- Wait. How old are you?

18:45.774 --> 18:48.477
- Sixteen.
- You can't even work yet.

18:48.577 --> 18:50.813
- What are you gonna do in Vegas?
- Be an apprentice.

18:50.913 --> 18:53.415
Does your mom
even know you're gone?

18:53.515 --> 18:56.318
Do you wanna see
a trick or not?

18:56.418 --> 18:59.288
Yeah, okay.
So we're here with Steven Lee,

18:59.388 --> 19:02.424
or should I call you
the great Stefan?

19:04.459 --> 19:07.629
I can show you guys
the morph and match,

19:07.729 --> 19:09.647
or maybe even
the coin...

19:11.750 --> 19:14.536
God, did you see that?
That was crazy!

19:14.636 --> 19:16.839
Oh, my God, you have to show Tyler.
Tyler, come here.

19:16.939 --> 19:19.541
You should put that on YouTube;
You'd get a million hits.

19:19.641 --> 19:22.201
Seriously, that's amazing.
Will you do it one more time, please?

19:21.710 --> 19:22.710
Okay.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.697
Freeze frame.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.367
Go back.

19:31.220 --> 19:32.837
Stop the tape.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.508
Who's that?

19:39.178 --> 19:40.745
Go back
a few frames.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.537
There's only three women
on the passenger list--

19:48.637 --> 19:52.407
Rachel Brody, Vicki maracova,
and leann hookplat.

19:52.507 --> 19:54.443
She wasn't
supposed to be there.

19:54.543 --> 19:57.962
Advance forward
three frames.

19:59.731 --> 20:03.385
- Capture that frame and advance one more.
- Sure.

20:03.485 --> 20:04.786
Got it.

20:04.886 --> 20:06.470
Capture again
and then overlay.

20:10.776 --> 20:12.776
Zoom 35 %.

20:14.479 --> 20:17.715
- And what's that inside?
- Pan the image.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.374
- Wow.
- That's gotta be 100 grand easy.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.942
We may have found
our motive.

20:27.042 --> 20:29.322
But if he wanted the money,
why not kill her and take it?

20:28.977 --> 20:31.446
Why slaughter
all the others?

20:31.546 --> 20:33.965
Go over to the dog carrier
on the edge of the bag.

20:35.667 --> 20:36.919
That's army issue.

20:37.019 --> 20:38.736
And capture that frame.

20:41.240 --> 20:42.873
"G. Fleishman."

20:45.244 --> 20:47.729
I don't know,
maybe Gina or glenda.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.299
Call fort irwin, have them
run it through their database

20:50.399 --> 20:52.367
of reserved and retired
military personnel

20:52.467 --> 20:54.570
in California
and Nevada.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.238
Let's see
what they've got.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.907
Keep going. I want to see
who this woman is.

20:59.007 --> 21:02.644
That's amazing.
Will you do it one more time, please?

21:22.948 --> 21:24.600
Whoo! All right!

21:26.468 --> 21:27.748
All right,
just a quick thought.

21:27.669 --> 21:29.571
Should it be
taking this long?

21:29.671 --> 21:31.907
I don't know, but I've been
to Vegas 100 times,

21:32.007 --> 21:34.592
and I've never seen
this road before.

21:39.064 --> 21:43.067
I'm gonna go and have a
word with what's-his-face.

21:44.403 --> 21:45.887
Excuse me. Sorry.

21:45.987 --> 21:47.187
Hello.

21:48.090 --> 21:50.292
So, um, much longer?

21:50.392 --> 21:52.294
What's with the camera?

21:52.394 --> 21:54.463
I'm a director.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.598
You been paid
to direct anything?

21:56.698 --> 21:58.267
No, not yet, but...

21:58.367 --> 22:00.669
So you're a girl
with a camera.

22:00.769 --> 22:03.538
Right. Can I ask why
we're going this way,

22:03.638 --> 22:05.540
because it's not
actually a road out there.

22:05.640 --> 22:07.876
That's a dirt track,
by the looks of it.

22:07.976 --> 22:10.412
I have another pick-up
past kidwell.

22:10.512 --> 22:11.813
This is the only way in.

22:11.913 --> 22:14.583
Stop your damn
complaining!

22:14.683 --> 22:16.685
Excuse me. I was
only asking.

22:16.785 --> 22:18.954
Get that damn thing
out of my face.

22:19.054 --> 22:20.455
What? Sit down.

22:20.555 --> 22:22.557
Out of my face!

22:22.657 --> 22:26.561
Oh, my God!
You fucking psychopath!

22:26.661 --> 22:29.031
- Jesus Christ.
- You all right?

22:29.131 --> 22:30.766
Are you okay?

23:02.063 --> 23:03.632
Out, out, out.

23:03.732 --> 23:06.884
Get out of
the mini-van.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.360
Get away from the bus,
it might explode.

23:30.225 --> 23:32.561
It could be
dangerous.

23:32.661 --> 23:36.131
What were you
expecting out here?

23:36.231 --> 23:37.833
What about the radio?

23:37.933 --> 23:39.835
The radio
was pulled a year ago.

23:39.935 --> 23:41.870
We gotta use
the cell phone.

23:41.970 --> 23:44.106
What do you mean,
they pulled out the radio?

23:44.206 --> 23:46.074
Brilliant.
Brilliant news.

23:46.174 --> 23:48.134
Okay, what are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

23:48.210 --> 23:49.810
Fuck me.

23:50.946 --> 23:53.448
What the fuck
is that?

23:53.548 --> 23:56.618
Looks like barbed wire.

23:56.718 --> 23:58.720
It came from
that fence over there.

23:58.820 --> 24:01.089
Oh, my God!
Why didn't you drive around it?

24:01.189 --> 24:02.891
I couldn't see it, could I?

24:02.991 --> 24:04.860
Stop fighting.
This isn't helping anything.

24:04.960 --> 24:07.729
So what are
we gonna do?

24:07.829 --> 24:10.165
We can't go anywhere.
Look at Vicki's leg.

24:10.265 --> 24:13.435
- I'm fine.
- You're not fine. You're bleeding.

24:13.535 --> 24:15.137
There's an emergency phone.

24:15.237 --> 24:18.106
There has to be one
at that truck repair shop.

24:18.206 --> 24:20.008
I didn't see
a truck repair shop.

24:20.108 --> 24:21.710
We just passed it.

24:21.810 --> 24:23.645
Look, I believe him.

24:23.745 --> 24:25.547
If he says there's
a truck repair shop...

24:25.647 --> 24:28.850
I haven't seen anything this entire journey, Tyler.

24:28.950 --> 24:31.153
Let's just try
and walk down there.

24:31.253 --> 24:33.188
I haven't seen another fucking living person.

24:33.288 --> 24:35.690
It's not that far back.
Let's go.

24:35.790 --> 24:37.590
Let's go.

24:37.759 --> 24:39.661
Wait, I'm not leaving
without my son's present.

24:39.761 --> 24:41.161
Vicki, come on,
we don't have time.

24:43.598 --> 24:45.901
It's not safe
in there!

24:46.001 --> 24:47.869
You can't
be serious.

24:47.969 --> 24:50.105
- Vicki!
- It's not worth it.

24:50.205 --> 24:51.706
Get the fuck
out of there!

24:51.806 --> 24:53.775
I'll go.
I'll go.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.710
I don't trust
this guy.

24:55.810 --> 24:57.813
We're not quite
in Vegas yet,

24:57.913 --> 25:00.081
but we'll get there
eventually.

25:00.181 --> 25:02.217
It's a bit of
an adventure.

25:02.317 --> 25:05.086
And there's our
now-destroyed bus,

25:05.186 --> 25:07.889
which is fantastic
news for us.

25:07.989 --> 25:11.389
Okay. Here we go.

25:12.894 --> 25:15.797
I'm thinkin',
what if I died?

25:15.897 --> 25:18.200
I won't ever see
my mom again.

25:18.300 --> 25:21.636
What happened?
Did you run away?

25:21.736 --> 25:24.072
Yeah.
Nick happened.

25:24.172 --> 25:26.372
Who's Nick?

25:26.641 --> 25:29.544
An asshole who was
ruining my life.

25:29.644 --> 25:30.444
Huh.

25:31.580 --> 25:35.150
My mom, she just lets him
do whatever he wants,

25:35.250 --> 25:38.086
and I got pissed
and I just left

25:38.186 --> 25:40.555
without saying
anything.

25:40.655 --> 25:42.858
She's probably worried
sick about you.

25:42.958 --> 25:46.544
Yeah, I need to tell her
I'm sorry.

25:49.314 --> 25:52.016
Leann, leann,
come here for a second.

25:54.052 --> 25:56.705
With everything
that's happening,

25:56.805 --> 25:58.923
does it put everything
into perspective?

26:01.259 --> 26:04.328
Does almost dying kind of put
everything in perspective?

26:09.334 --> 26:11.586
That's right.

26:11.686 --> 26:13.804
We all could've...

26:19.744 --> 26:20.944
Jesus.

26:22.263 --> 26:25.349
Looks like a bomb
hit this place.

26:28.653 --> 26:31.989
As long as they didn't
bomb the damn phone.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.364
Come on.

27:46.665 --> 27:49.033
- How's your leg?
- It's fine.

27:55.306 --> 27:58.008
Are there, like,
faucets or something?

28:03.815 --> 28:05.916
It's all rusted over.

28:09.187 --> 28:12.741
The new favorite
holiday destination

28:12.841 --> 28:15.410
of most people.

28:15.510 --> 28:18.813
Over here we have, um,

28:18.913 --> 28:21.131
dilapidated office.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.869
Crazy broad,
and, um...

28:28.073 --> 28:30.158
Abandoned trucks.

28:30.258 --> 28:31.993
Everything you could want

28:32.093 --> 28:35.479
in a prime holiday
destination. Fantastic.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.116
She was
a figure skater.

28:55.216 --> 28:58.286
Ah. Bet she won gold
in Torino.

28:58.386 --> 29:01.056
We got a phone in
this building back here.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.158
It's gettin' too dark.
Wires are all jumbled up.

29:03.258 --> 29:05.093
Does that thing
have a light on it?

29:05.193 --> 29:07.729
Yeah, it's got a light,
and it's got night vision,

29:07.829 --> 29:09.431
so it'll
be perfect.

29:09.531 --> 29:11.066
That's for her movie.
Use mine.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.101
Are you sure?

29:13.201 --> 29:15.804
I put batteries in this stupid thing three times.

29:15.904 --> 29:18.422
Press "record,"
and the light should come on.

29:19.858 --> 29:21.925
I'm happy someone's
using it.

29:25.396 --> 29:27.182
How you like it, huh?

29:27.282 --> 29:29.384
Not so much fun
like this, is it?

29:29.484 --> 29:32.454
Hm. It's fine.
Just more proof for when I sue you.

29:32.554 --> 29:35.023
Find everybody,
tell 'em to meet here.

29:35.123 --> 29:37.243
I don't wanna be out here
any longer than we have to.

29:37.125 --> 29:38.125
Okay.

29:49.354 --> 29:50.554
Leann.

29:53.792 --> 29:57.245
Leann, Ben's
found a phone, so...

29:57.345 --> 29:59.347
He wants me to
get everyone.

29:59.447 --> 30:01.932
Can you...
Are you in here?

31:31.572 --> 31:34.075
Oh, my God,
what happened?

31:34.175 --> 31:36.211
Where are
you going?

31:36.311 --> 31:38.479
Steven, wait.

31:38.579 --> 31:40.179
Someone!

31:40.648 --> 31:42.584
Anybody, please!

31:42.684 --> 31:44.552
What's going on?

31:44.652 --> 31:47.155
I don't know.
I don't know what happened.

31:50.992 --> 31:52.961
I just found him.

31:57.365 --> 32:00.969
He just came
out of nowhere.

32:01.069 --> 32:04.239
Oh, my God, you guys,
I see somebody.

32:04.339 --> 32:06.374
Oh, my God,
he just ran across.

32:06.474 --> 32:08.977
Everybody inside.
Everybody inside.

32:09.077 --> 32:12.647
Come on,
come on, come on.

32:12.747 --> 32:15.483
First victim,
Steven Lee.

32:15.583 --> 32:17.401
Sixteen years old.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.458
Got him.
It's not her name, it's his.

32:23.558 --> 32:25.260
Gerald fleishman,
retired army sergeant.

32:25.360 --> 32:29.264
Photo lab found
these online.

32:29.364 --> 32:32.066
- That's our girl.
- His wife, Katrina fleishman.

32:32.166 --> 32:34.903
Married for 20 years,
but looks like Gerald had some problems

32:35.003 --> 32:36.471
when he got back
from Iraq.

32:36.571 --> 32:38.673
They called it
post-traumatic stress.

32:38.773 --> 32:40.853
He spent a year at Crescent
park mental institution.

32:40.608 --> 32:42.277
Get this, we just
ran financials.

32:42.377 --> 32:44.946
His entire account
cleaned out two days ago.

32:45.046 --> 32:46.981
Over 90 grand.

32:47.081 --> 32:49.517
Gabe, pull up the mini hd camera
the driver took around back,

32:49.617 --> 32:53.070
- and see if he got any clear shots of it.
- Okay.

32:58.343 --> 32:59.661
How do you like it, huh?

32:59.761 --> 33:02.430
Not so much fun
like this, is it?

33:02.530 --> 33:04.132
Hm, it's fine.

33:04.232 --> 33:06.200
Just more proof
for when I sue you, so...

33:06.300 --> 33:08.202
Find everybody,
tell 'em to meet here.

33:08.302 --> 33:10.422
I don't wanna be out here
any longer than we have to.

33:10.338 --> 33:11.338
Okay.

33:18.629 --> 33:21.131
Step over door.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.246
What have we here?

34:27.482 --> 34:29.681
Goddamn it!

34:47.819 --> 34:49.319
Son of a bitch...

34:57.528 --> 35:01.416
- Is that it?
- Uh, there should be more.

35:01.516 --> 35:03.351
It's still rolling.

35:03.451 --> 35:06.269
We should be
seeing something.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.426
That's not our driver.

35:11.526 --> 35:14.611
- Who is it?
- A better question is when is it?

36:13.471 --> 36:17.725
Geez.

36:40.298 --> 36:42.465
- All right, that's enough.
- Fuck!

36:49.807 --> 36:52.642
I am gonna
nail this bastard.

36:58.950 --> 37:02.786
Um, Gabe, go back
a few frames.

37:07.792 --> 37:10.611
Keep going.
Keep going.

37:10.711 --> 37:12.914
In the reflection.
His face is in the glass.

37:13.014 --> 37:14.749
It's too dark.

37:14.849 --> 37:16.666
Get in closer.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.858
Isolate the sharp
edges of the face.

37:23.958 --> 37:25.875
The wrinkles, the teeth,
the facial hair.

37:30.648 --> 37:33.501
- Okay, what is he doing?
- The shadows will give us a clean outline,

37:33.601 --> 37:35.521
- then we'll invert the color.
- Okay, I got it.

37:35.469 --> 37:36.753
Reverse it again.

37:49.800 --> 37:54.288
- A mask. - That's the welder's
mask we found at the scene.

37:54.388 --> 37:57.625
You work the 91-a.

37:57.725 --> 37:59.860
- What's a 91-a?
- He was a machinist.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.230
Fleishman's unstable,
he has a history of violence,

38:02.330 --> 38:04.465
his wife robs him blind,
he goes mad with revenge.

38:04.565 --> 38:06.701
- Circumstantial.
- Get it out to p.R.

38:06.801 --> 38:08.836
I want his picture on
every news outlet.

38:08.936 --> 38:10.571
We need to keep
checking the video.

38:10.671 --> 38:12.506
You find me some
indisputable evidence,

38:12.606 --> 38:15.243
'cause I'm taking this prick
straight to the chair.

38:15.343 --> 38:17.311
You heard her.

38:17.411 --> 38:20.581
- Let's go.
- Rachel's camera coming up.

38:30.341 --> 38:32.660
Everybody
stay quiet.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.795
Be quiet!

38:34.895 --> 38:36.564
They killed him.

38:36.664 --> 38:38.532
I didn't see anybody
from this end.

38:38.632 --> 38:40.334
You see anything?

38:40.434 --> 38:42.670
Why did they kill Steven?
He was just a kid.

38:42.770 --> 38:45.273
Will you turn
that goddamn camera off?!

38:45.373 --> 38:47.475
The cops will need this
to identify who did this.

38:51.078 --> 38:54.515
They have to know
what happened to us!

38:54.615 --> 38:57.718
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do, what are we gonna do?

38:57.818 --> 38:59.587
Maybe we
should run for it.

38:59.687 --> 39:02.957
Run for it?
Have you seen Vicki's leg, Tyler?

39:03.057 --> 39:06.827
We're, like, 40 Miles
away from anything.

39:06.927 --> 39:09.363
And it's
pitch black out there.

39:09.463 --> 39:11.932
We could fall into
a 40-foot ditch,

39:12.032 --> 39:14.792
and never even know it,
not to mention the coyotes, the rattlesnakes.

39:14.735 --> 39:16.671
No, you said there was
an emergency phone.

39:16.771 --> 39:19.507
You said there was an emergency phone.
Can't you fix it?

39:19.607 --> 39:21.876
The wires are split
pretty bad.

39:21.976 --> 39:23.611
Isn't there anything
on the bus,

39:23.711 --> 39:26.080
any wires, tools,
anything you can use?

39:26.180 --> 39:28.015
I might be able
to rig something.

39:28.115 --> 39:30.351
You just said
it was too dangerous.

39:30.451 --> 39:32.851
But if there's something we can use,
he has to go out there.

39:32.753 --> 39:34.889
Take my camera,
use the light.

39:34.989 --> 39:37.058
I might as well put a bull's-eye on my ass.

39:37.158 --> 39:39.327
My camera has night vision.
If I come with you,

39:39.427 --> 39:41.395
we could do that and be totally undetectable.

39:41.495 --> 39:43.998
I'll take your camera.
Give me--

39:44.098 --> 39:46.467
I'm sorry if I was
a prick earlier.

39:46.567 --> 39:48.767
You? Never.

39:48.969 --> 39:51.405
I guess it's my turn
to be a hero now.

39:51.505 --> 39:53.040
They tell me I look
like tom cruise.

39:53.140 --> 39:55.576
Oddly enough,
I can see that.

39:55.676 --> 39:58.579
I saw him, I saw him.
He's on the other side of the yard.

39:58.679 --> 40:00.715
You have to go.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.483
Follow me.

40:02.583 --> 40:04.118
Can you take that?

40:04.218 --> 40:06.403
Go, go, go, quick!

40:56.587 --> 40:57.987
Rachel!

40:58.138 --> 41:00.074
Oh, my God.

41:00.174 --> 41:02.476
Ben. Okay, okay.
Come here.

41:07.665 --> 41:09.650
Okay, just
go straight.

41:09.750 --> 41:12.135
Straight. Just keep going straight.
You're fine.

41:18.826 --> 41:20.728
Oh, my God.
Did you hear that?

41:22.563 --> 41:24.963
Sh. Sh.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.735
The bus should be
right down this hill.

41:27.835 --> 41:30.587
- Okay.
- Let's keep going.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.192
Wait.
Wait.

41:38.178 --> 41:40.714
Is that it?
I can't tell.

41:40.814 --> 41:43.117
Is it just...

41:43.217 --> 41:45.486
That's it,
that's it.

41:45.586 --> 41:47.521
Oh, thank God.

41:47.621 --> 41:49.821
Oh, my God.

41:50.090 --> 41:51.490
Rachel.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.238
I can see
the bus from here.

42:04.338 --> 42:06.574
Ben, Ben,
please.

42:06.674 --> 42:09.692
Please slow down.
You don't know what's out there.

42:30.247 --> 42:33.000
What are you
waiting for? Huh?

42:33.100 --> 42:34.900
I just...

42:44.795 --> 42:46.780
I'm gonna need
some light.

42:46.880 --> 42:48.932
Okay.
I'll figure it out.

42:51.068 --> 42:53.120
Watch yourself.
Are you okay?

42:53.220 --> 42:55.689
Just hurry up, please.

42:55.789 --> 42:58.692
I need to find my tools
so I can pull those speakers.

42:58.792 --> 43:00.227
Careful,
careful.

43:00.327 --> 43:01.527
Wires.

43:02.262 --> 43:04.798
Up here, up here.

43:04.898 --> 43:06.983
- Yeah.
- Hurry.

43:17.027 --> 43:20.147
- Shit.
- What, what?

43:20.247 --> 43:21.982
There was a flare gun.

43:22.082 --> 43:24.051
Why didn't you
say something?

43:24.151 --> 43:25.719
I forgot.

43:25.819 --> 43:27.870
Where is it?

43:31.725 --> 43:34.061
Oh,
my God! Oh, my God!

43:34.161 --> 43:35.696
Who's out there?

43:35.796 --> 43:37.665
Can we please go?
Please, let's just go.

43:37.765 --> 43:40.034
- Wait here.
- Ben, please.

43:40.134 --> 43:42.269
You don't know
who's out there.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.904
You wanna fuck with me?

44:09.897 --> 44:12.015
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

44:24.978 --> 44:28.765
Please, please,
please.

44:46.417 --> 44:48.284
What happened?

44:51.755 --> 44:54.375
- What?
- Ben's dead.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.254
Where's leann?

45:07.354 --> 45:09.056
Her and Tyler--
her and Tyler

45:09.156 --> 45:11.925
leann. Leann!
Where is she?!

45:14.795 --> 45:18.365
Stop that. She went
looking for you.

45:18.465 --> 45:20.665
But they...

45:21.235 --> 45:24.320
They didn't come back.

45:40.037 --> 45:42.972
My son turned ten
last week.

45:45.476 --> 45:49.345
This was supposed to be
his birthday present.

45:51.949 --> 45:54.401
When me and his dad
got divorced,

45:54.501 --> 45:57.920
he had to choose
between us.

45:59.089 --> 46:01.357
He chose his dad.

46:05.195 --> 46:07.915
Yesterday,
I was right there,

46:08.015 --> 46:10.199
at the front
of his house.

46:15.272 --> 46:17.240
And I didn't have...

46:20.344 --> 46:25.766
I didn't have balls
to walk up and give him

46:25.866 --> 46:28.266
his present.

46:29.553 --> 46:31.788
I should tell him...

46:36.560 --> 46:38.795
How sorry I am.

46:40.798 --> 46:43.117
How I love him.

46:43.217 --> 46:46.402
And I'm so damn scared.

46:48.438 --> 46:50.190
What are we
gonna do?

46:50.290 --> 46:51.759
He's here.

46:51.859 --> 46:52.859
What?

46:53.927 --> 46:55.496
He's here.

46:55.596 --> 46:58.381
Get the shot of him.

47:01.318 --> 47:03.318
He's here.

47:50.467 --> 47:53.020
Wait, wait.
No, not yet.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.322
Not yet,
not yet.

47:55.422 --> 47:57.506
Wait.
Okay, now. Now.

48:27.404 --> 48:31.158
Leann, leann.
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

48:37.981 --> 48:41.935
I heard Tyler screaming,
and when I turned around, he was gone.

48:42.035 --> 48:44.435
He was gone.

49:00.470 --> 49:02.422
It's pretty beat up.

49:02.522 --> 49:05.058
I don't know how much
longer it's gonna record for.

49:05.158 --> 49:07.527
Do you really think filming
this matters anymore?

49:07.627 --> 49:10.279
Of course it does.
He has to pay for what he did.

49:11.682 --> 49:14.350
And what he's
going to do.

49:24.261 --> 49:26.546
I know why you're here.

49:26.646 --> 49:28.615
What are
you doing?

49:28.715 --> 49:30.651
Just sayin'
my piece.

49:30.751 --> 49:32.686
Do you know
something?

49:32.786 --> 49:35.289
If you know,
you better tell us.

49:35.389 --> 49:36.690
Or what?

49:36.790 --> 49:38.492
You gonna kill me?

49:38.592 --> 49:41.028
You're completely
mad.

49:44.698 --> 49:49.303
You think stayin' here's
gonna change something.

49:49.403 --> 49:52.603
Now who's crazy?

49:53.040 --> 49:55.709
Where are you going?
Come back.

49:55.809 --> 49:57.660
Shut the door!

49:59.997 --> 50:01.197
Leann.

50:01.448 --> 50:03.583
I can't see her anymore.
Where'd she go.

50:03.683 --> 50:06.202
For God's sake, here, here.
Turn on the night--

50:09.639 --> 50:12.308
maybe she's pregnant.

50:18.715 --> 50:21.635
Oh, my God,
I think I see something.

50:21.735 --> 50:24.571
It looks like...
I think it's a flare gun.

50:24.671 --> 50:27.007
Where? He just
dropped it there?

50:27.107 --> 50:29.042
We could use it.
We have to go get it.

50:29.142 --> 50:31.378
Are you insane? If we
go out there, we're dead.

50:31.478 --> 50:33.981
What are we gonna do?
We can't just sit here.

50:34.081 --> 50:36.316
She's right. We have
to do something.

50:36.416 --> 50:39.336
- What if he has a gun?
- If he had a gun, he would have shot us already.

50:39.219 --> 50:41.722
This is gonna even out the field.
We need to get this.

50:41.822 --> 50:44.524
Okay, you really wanna
go out there

50:44.624 --> 50:46.259
after what's happened
with Tyler?

50:46.359 --> 50:48.695
Is that what
you wanna do? Hm?

50:48.795 --> 50:51.031
We have
to get it.

50:51.131 --> 50:53.749
- What then?
- I'll go.

50:57.187 --> 51:00.374
Vicki, I don't think
this is a good idea.

51:00.474 --> 51:04.011
My son will get
his present.

51:04.111 --> 51:06.580
No, wait,
wait, wait.

51:06.680 --> 51:07.680
Wait.

51:10.367 --> 51:13.102
Take this,
for luck.

51:29.820 --> 51:32.788
Quick. Shut the door,
shut the door.

51:42.699 --> 51:44.484
Oh, there she is.

51:44.584 --> 51:45.584
Okay.

51:53.310 --> 51:56.312
Why is she moving so slowly?
Hurry up.

52:02.285 --> 52:03.637
Oh, my God.

52:03.737 --> 52:05.172
No. Vicki!

52:41.391 --> 52:44.660
Come on, leann. Run!

52:59.809 --> 53:02.796
Leann, get out
of there, quick.

53:02.896 --> 53:04.096
Leann!

53:07.317 --> 53:09.269
Where is he?

53:09.369 --> 53:12.506
Is he outside
the door?

53:12.606 --> 53:15.457
- Leann.
- No, not yet.

53:16.726 --> 53:19.328
Which door
is he at?

53:20.764 --> 53:23.399
Where the fuck
is he?

53:28.572 --> 53:30.372
Hurry up.

53:44.321 --> 53:46.506
I wish he'd
just do it.

53:46.606 --> 53:48.608
Don't say that.

53:51.011 --> 53:54.230
I'm scared.
I'm so fucking scared.

54:01.738 --> 54:03.806
Oh, my God! Quick.

54:07.510 --> 54:10.546
Ben! You're alive.

54:13.817 --> 54:17.237
I saw you. He grabbed you.
What happened?

54:17.337 --> 54:18.872
He got me in the back.

54:18.972 --> 54:20.807
He left me out there
to die.

54:20.907 --> 54:22.676
Let me see.
Oh, my God!

54:22.776 --> 54:24.477
Fuck that guy.
I'm not dyin' today.

54:24.577 --> 54:26.413
And I got these.

54:26.513 --> 54:28.548
- What is that?
- From the speakers.

54:28.648 --> 54:31.284
I can fix it now.
Red to red, green to green.

54:31.384 --> 54:33.787
The emergency phone.
We can call for help.

54:33.887 --> 54:36.423
We better be gettin' this.

54:36.523 --> 54:38.474
We gotta go.

54:40.510 --> 54:43.496
Hey, I'm checkin' footage
from Katrina's camera,

54:43.596 --> 54:46.733
and, uh, you're gonna
wanna see this.

54:46.833 --> 54:48.768
They found him.

54:48.868 --> 54:51.805
Hotel manager in Hollywood
saw fleishman

54:51.905 --> 54:55.308
on the news, said he's been
staying in room 315 for a week.

54:55.408 --> 54:57.244
LAPD's sending grab team to pick him up now.

54:57.344 --> 54:59.928
- Whose camera is this?
- Told you you'd wanna see it.

55:03.416 --> 55:05.801
I can't hear this.

55:08.672 --> 55:11.024
You watching, pigs?

55:11.124 --> 55:13.124
Yeah, you.

55:15.562 --> 55:17.964
Bunch of pork,
scramblin' all over the desert,

55:18.064 --> 55:21.016
tryin' to piece
this shit together.

55:22.552 --> 55:25.338
Time to make
my dyin' wish,

55:25.438 --> 55:27.022
and all that.

55:28.058 --> 55:29.609
I don't want much.

55:29.709 --> 55:34.047
Just wanna be with
the one that I love.

55:34.147 --> 55:37.317
His name is Gerry.

55:37.417 --> 55:39.419
Gerry fleishman.

55:39.519 --> 55:42.789
You make sure
I'm in the same plot.

55:42.889 --> 55:47.910
You bury me in
the same plot, you understand?

55:51.114 --> 55:55.835
We had our ups and downs
like any couple,

55:55.935 --> 55:58.038
but after he got
back from Iraq,

55:58.138 --> 56:00.538
he was sick.

56:01.825 --> 56:03.892
He was real sick.

56:06.096 --> 56:09.816
I tried to reach him,

56:09.916 --> 56:12.316
to help him,

56:12.886 --> 56:15.922
but the old Gerry
was gone, just shut down.

56:16.022 --> 56:18.625
On top of that,
the doctor told him

56:18.725 --> 56:20.776
that he had cancer.

56:22.746 --> 56:25.665
Said he was
gonna rot away

56:25.765 --> 56:29.736
like some piece
of old fruit.

56:29.836 --> 56:32.087
Gerald fleishman, LAPD.
Open the door.

56:34.824 --> 56:37.444
Fleishman, LAPD.
Open the fuckin' door.

56:37.544 --> 56:40.580
It's like the reality stars
you see on TV.

56:40.680 --> 56:43.783
There ain't no reason
for them to be famous,

56:43.883 --> 56:45.634
but they are.

56:46.703 --> 56:47.903
Break it down.

56:50.073 --> 56:52.058
Drop the gun!
Drop the gun!

56:52.158 --> 56:56.696
Like God just reached down
and touched 'em.

56:56.796 --> 57:00.100
Changed their whole lives
forever.

57:00.200 --> 57:04.371
Well, he done the same
thing to my Gerry.

57:04.471 --> 57:07.674
But it wasn't no touch.

57:07.774 --> 57:10.774
It was a stomp.

57:17.033 --> 57:23.572
Looks like God's got
his stompin' boots on again.

57:28.912 --> 57:31.013
See ya soon, baby.

57:34.184 --> 57:37.019
File's corrupted.

57:38.721 --> 57:41.674
Whoa. Dude, how'd he
get the camera?

57:41.774 --> 57:43.525
That's the guy.

57:56.039 --> 57:58.839
There you are.

58:00.777 --> 58:02.945
I've been waiting for you.

58:15.492 --> 58:17.292
It's you.

58:56.232 --> 58:57.832
Stop it.

59:01.738 --> 59:03.338
Burquez.

59:03.856 --> 59:06.626
So we got a positive I.D.
On fleishman.

59:06.726 --> 59:10.630
But I guarantee you,
this guy,

59:10.730 --> 59:13.600
he didn't kill
anybody yesterday.

59:13.700 --> 59:15.168
And why is that?

59:15.268 --> 59:18.137
Because he's been
dead at least a week.

59:18.237 --> 59:21.574
Apparent self-inflicted
gun wound into the mouth.

59:21.674 --> 59:23.142
Did leave a note, though.

59:23.242 --> 59:27.247
Says for Katrina,
take all of my money

59:27.347 --> 59:29.582
out of the bank
and go to Vegas.

59:29.682 --> 59:30.950
Says 'cause he's dead anyway,

59:31.050 --> 59:33.086
she should have
the time of her life.

59:33.186 --> 59:35.737
Anyway, I'll call you if
we get anything else.

59:38.107 --> 59:41.027
So if it's not
fleishman,

59:41.127 --> 59:42.228
uh, who is it?

59:42.328 --> 59:45.347
It's him.
Play it.

01:00:18.648 --> 01:00:21.100
- What was that about?
- Rewind it.

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:23.218
Reverse it
and play it again.

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:48.328
He knew
we'd be watching.

01:00:48.428 --> 01:00:50.697
He's challenging us.

01:00:50.797 --> 01:00:55.101
This whole thing
was planned.

01:00:55.201 --> 01:00:56.836
The torch, the mask...

01:00:56.936 --> 01:00:59.339
It's some sort of fantasy,
a ritual.

01:00:59.439 --> 01:01:02.342
- Are you saying--
- I'm saying we're dealing with a serial killer.

01:01:02.442 --> 01:01:05.122
- Smart, meticulous, this wasn't his first.
- It won't be his last.

01:01:04.777 --> 01:01:06.646
How can he have
planned all this

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.986
- when the bus wreck was an accident?
- Unless he knew--

01:01:08.915 --> 01:01:10.795
the driver mentioned a stop
outside of kidwell.

01:01:10.783 --> 01:01:12.352
Could've buried
the fence wire.

01:01:12.452 --> 01:01:14.172
Shuttle company said
it was a nonstop trip.

01:01:14.153 --> 01:01:17.005
Then why go down the road
in the first place?

01:01:20.143 --> 01:01:23.396
Driver. Get me his file.
I want everything we can find on this guy now.

01:01:23.496 --> 01:01:25.714
Play back
the girl's camera.

01:01:42.031 --> 01:01:43.231
Quick.

01:01:44.016 --> 01:01:46.252
Ben, are you sure
you're okay?

01:01:46.352 --> 01:01:47.887
Told you, I'm fine.

01:01:47.987 --> 01:01:49.756
I can't believe
you're still alive.

01:01:49.856 --> 01:01:51.991
I can't believe
he left you out there.

01:01:52.091 --> 01:01:54.260
- Oh, my God!
- The juice is low. Hurry.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.829
No. That lady
might still be alive.

01:01:56.929 --> 01:01:58.798
We haven't got
time for this.

01:01:58.898 --> 01:02:00.667
We can't just ignore this.
We have to go in.

01:02:00.767 --> 01:02:03.351
I'm going in.
Oh, my God.

01:02:09.542 --> 01:02:12.912
Leann,
where is he?

01:02:13.012 --> 01:02:15.148
Leann.
Leann!

01:02:15.248 --> 01:02:17.717
Oh, my God.
Leann!

01:02:17.817 --> 01:02:20.435
Please help me.

01:02:25.057 --> 01:02:27.457
Seen enough?

01:02:27.994 --> 01:02:30.163
Wait, wait, wait.
Are you okay?

01:02:30.263 --> 01:02:31.898
I'm fine.

01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.181
Okay. Just go.

01:02:45.995 --> 01:02:47.795
Ow. Fuck!

01:03:01.210 --> 01:03:04.430
Run for the fuel house.
I'll be right behind you.

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:05.998
Are you ready?

01:03:06.098 --> 01:03:08.298
Go, go. Go.

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.425
Nobody's gettin' in here now.

01:03:32.525 --> 01:03:34.810
Phone's back that way.

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:41.316
Ben?

01:03:42.501 --> 01:03:44.437
He was right behind me.

01:03:44.537 --> 01:03:45.337
Ben?

01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:56.598
- Run!
- Leann!

01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:14.215
Leann?

01:04:32.268 --> 01:04:35.537
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:04:40.476 --> 01:04:43.296
Okay, I just
have to get out...

01:04:43.396 --> 01:04:45.513
I just have...

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:05.233
Ben?

01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:08.070
Ben.

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.675
Come on,
come on.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.607
Okay, green to green.

01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:04.577
Green to green,
green to green, red to red.

01:06:04.677 --> 01:06:07.329
Red to red.

01:08:00.509 --> 01:08:02.709
Keep going.

01:08:04.480 --> 01:08:07.215
That's it.
No more video.

01:08:09.718 --> 01:08:12.187
That's the end.

01:08:14.190 --> 01:08:15.190
Fuck!

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:20.328
We have one more phone.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:27.301
- Okay, play it.
- Haven't you seen enough?

01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:36.162
Okay, so, mom, this is
where we're at right now.

01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:38.531
Um, takin' a little break.

01:08:38.631 --> 01:08:41.233
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm okay,

01:08:41.332 --> 01:08:44.103
and on my way to Vegas.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:46.404
Uh, I shouldn't have left
like that.

01:08:46.505 --> 01:08:48.790
I was just mad and...

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:54.345
I don't
trust you anymore.

01:08:54.446 --> 01:08:57.216
Trust me?
How is this a matter of trust?

01:08:57.316 --> 01:08:59.318
We didn't talk
about this.

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:01.187
You didn't
ask me first.

01:09:01.287 --> 01:09:03.189
You didn't
prepare me.

01:09:03.288 --> 01:09:05.758
You just came up on my big moment
and asked me to marry you.

01:09:08.827 --> 01:09:11.330
Stop being so needy.
What are you doing right now?

01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:13.599
We almost have a near-death experience,

01:09:13.698 --> 01:09:15.801
and you bring me
in here to do this?

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:18.104
Oh, my God,
grow up! Stop!

01:09:18.203 --> 01:09:19.537
...my priorities
in life.

01:09:19.638 --> 01:09:20.738
- Your priorities?
- Yeah.

01:09:20.839 --> 01:09:21.841
I don't wanna
marry you.

01:09:21.941 --> 01:09:23.876
Get it through
your skull.

01:09:23.975 --> 01:09:26.112
I don't want
to marry you! God!

01:09:26.212 --> 01:09:27.680
Go write a fucking
song about it,

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:30.116
and pretend to be
good at something.

01:09:30.216 --> 01:09:32.399
Jesus Christ!

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:39.541
What the fuck
are you lookin' at?

01:09:41.210 --> 01:09:43.828
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- What?

01:09:43.929 --> 01:09:46.432
I don't... I don't know.
There should be...

01:09:46.532 --> 01:09:48.767
There should be
more memory on the hard drive.

01:09:48.867 --> 01:09:51.837
It must've got, I guess,
erased or something.

01:09:51.937 --> 01:09:54.306
- Erased?
- There should be a memory card here.

01:09:54.406 --> 01:09:55.708
It's not...

01:09:55.808 --> 01:09:57.643
Okay, the memory card's
not in there and--

01:09:57.743 --> 01:09:59.645
- okay, where is it?
- Gabe.

01:09:59.745 --> 01:10:02.414
- I don't know.
- Gabe, sound. Sound on the TV.

01:10:02.514 --> 01:10:04.150
- I don't know.
- Sound.

01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:06.352
- Uh, okay.
- Oh, shit.

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:08.921
- <i>Yes, we can now confirm...</i>
<i>- Shit!</i>

01:10:09.021 --> 01:10:11.190
<i>The leaked footage is,</i>
<i>in fact, genuine.</i>

01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:13.559
<i>It's being called</i>
<i>a snuff film.</i>

01:10:13.659 --> 01:10:16.829
<i>And others on the web are</i>
<i>calling it an instant classic.</i>

01:10:16.929 --> 01:10:18.764
<i>What we know for sure</i>
<i>is that this video</i>

01:10:18.864 --> 01:10:21.800
<i>has gone viral,</i>
<i>with over 3 million hits</i>

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:23.903
<i>in the last hour alone.</i>

01:10:24.003 --> 01:10:26.205
<i>We're attempting to trace</i>
<i>the original...</i>

01:10:26.305 --> 01:10:28.407
How the fuck
did she get that?

01:10:28.507 --> 01:10:29.942
<i>...Las Vegas</i>
<i>police department,</i>

01:10:30.042 --> 01:10:32.411
<i>and how this will affect</i>
<i>their investigation.</i>

01:10:32.511 --> 01:10:35.414
Who had access
to those tapes?

01:10:35.514 --> 01:10:36.949
We uploaded the videos
to the server.

01:10:37.049 --> 01:10:38.584
It could've been
hacked by anyone.

01:10:38.684 --> 01:10:40.920
- Fuck!
- I.T., I.T.

01:10:41.020 --> 01:10:44.790
Yeah, how come everything I
sent you in the past four hours

01:10:44.890 --> 01:10:46.892
ends up on TV?
I don't know, turn it on.

01:10:46.992 --> 01:10:48.928
It's everywhere.

01:10:49.028 --> 01:10:52.198
Gary, why are you asking me this?
I'm asking you.

01:10:52.298 --> 01:10:53.732
It's your whole
department.

01:10:53.832 --> 01:10:55.834
And he's just playing with us,

01:10:55.934 --> 01:11:01.574
because this whole thing
is just a big fucking game.

01:11:04.310 --> 01:11:07.980
We're the police. Okay?
We're not just idiots running around.

01:11:08.080 --> 01:11:09.715
Check the fiber...

01:11:09.815 --> 01:11:11.415
Burquez.

01:11:11.650 --> 01:11:14.520
<i>The chief wants you</i>
<i>in his office right away.</i>

01:11:16.088 --> 01:11:17.088
Shit!

01:11:17.856 --> 01:11:20.226
Yeah, yeah. No.

01:11:20.326 --> 01:11:22.895
I'm comin' down.
I'm comin' down.

01:11:22.995 --> 01:11:25.346
I'm gonna
find out, man.

01:12:17.099 --> 01:12:19.685
It is crazy out there.

01:12:19.785 --> 01:12:22.021
Every channel's
showin' that video.

01:12:22.121 --> 01:12:24.923
Tell me
you found something.

01:12:25.023 --> 01:12:27.742
Um, just initial
background.

01:12:32.081 --> 01:12:33.999
William gentry.

01:12:34.099 --> 01:12:36.402
Bus driver Ben tuttle,
wasn't even his real name.

01:12:36.502 --> 01:12:38.904
Turns out he did three years for grand larceny.

01:12:39.004 --> 01:12:41.006
Tried to rob a bank
from the inside out.

01:12:41.106 --> 01:12:43.942
Shit. This guy went in
dressed like an armored guard.

01:12:44.042 --> 01:12:46.645
It was working until
the real guard showed up.

01:12:46.745 --> 01:12:48.580
Two people
ended up dead.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.998
It's too bad
we saw him die.

01:12:52.468 --> 01:12:54.987
He was staggering around
covered in blood,

01:12:55.087 --> 01:12:56.637
but we don't know
he was dead.

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:00.775
You think
he did it?

01:13:04.146 --> 01:13:05.146
What?

01:13:09.785 --> 01:13:11.919
Where you going?

01:13:16.592 --> 01:13:17.792
Flynn.

01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:19.812
I didn't know
you were back.

01:13:19.912 --> 01:13:21.580
How's our witness?

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.115
Barely said a word,

01:13:23.215 --> 01:13:25.984
but this kind of trauma
can really fuck your memory.

01:13:26.084 --> 01:13:27.619
Mind if I take a shot?

01:13:27.719 --> 01:13:29.519
Go ahead.

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:41.700
I'm detective Reese.

01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:43.885
How you holdin' up?

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:56.931
I thought you might
like this back.

01:14:01.570 --> 01:14:03.471
Luck of the Irish?

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.594
Mine's for luck, too.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:10.863
It was
my daughter's.

01:14:10.963 --> 01:14:12.363
Gracie.

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:20.788
You know, after
something like this happens,

01:14:24.026 --> 01:14:27.679
they say that
things will be okay,

01:14:27.779 --> 01:14:30.749
that it just
takes time,

01:14:30.849 --> 01:14:33.452
and life will
go back to normal.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:36.938
But it's not true,
ya know.

01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:41.576
Things can't be normal.

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:46.080
They just
keep going.

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.218
Maybe that's good
enough, ya know.

01:14:52.888 --> 01:14:54.088
Tyler?

01:14:55.140 --> 01:14:58.143
He's in the hospital.

01:14:58.243 --> 01:15:01.162
The doctors are doing
the best they can.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.853
What happened to her?

01:15:07.953 --> 01:15:10.238
Your daughter.

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:15.243
We were just
shoppin' at the mall.

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:21.616
She was in one of
those little play areas...

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:24.886
You know, with the slides
and the bean bags.

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:32.110
And I turned around
for a few minutes,

01:15:32.210 --> 01:15:35.596
and when I looked back
in on her, she was gone.

01:15:50.312 --> 01:15:53.712
Six months later,

01:15:53.932 --> 01:15:57.236
they found
her little body

01:15:57.336 --> 01:16:00.288
behind a truck stop
in barstow.

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:03.609
Just like that,

01:16:03.709 --> 01:16:06.294
somebody changes
your life forever.

01:16:09.097 --> 01:16:12.084
Did you find out
who did it?

01:16:12.184 --> 01:16:12.784
No.

01:16:14.052 --> 01:16:16.555
I just don't...
I don't understand

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:19.725
how someone can do
something like this

01:16:19.825 --> 01:16:22.127
to innocent people
like it's nothing.

01:16:22.227 --> 01:16:25.964
To a serial killer,

01:16:26.064 --> 01:16:28.767
murder is an art.

01:16:28.867 --> 01:16:30.667
Or sport.

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:34.740
They wanna
be the best.

01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:37.543
It's their way
of getting attention.

01:16:37.643 --> 01:16:42.180
Showing the world
what they're capable of.

01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.966
The power that they have
over life and death.

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:50.022
In their minds,

01:16:50.122 --> 01:16:52.691
they're different from
the rest of us.

01:16:52.791 --> 01:16:55.810
They feel like
they're gods.

01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:01.900
And they never stop.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:04.218
And that's why
I need your help.

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:06.939
You gotta try
and help me.

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:09.141
I don't think I can.

01:17:09.241 --> 01:17:11.241
If you can remember
something about what happened,

01:17:11.076 --> 01:17:14.095
they maybe I can stop him
from hurting anyone else.

01:17:16.632 --> 01:17:18.584
You understand
that, right?

01:17:18.684 --> 01:17:20.586
The driver, Ben.

01:17:20.686 --> 01:17:23.188
Did you see him again after you
went into that last building?

01:17:23.288 --> 01:17:25.591
I don't remember.

01:17:25.691 --> 01:17:26.691
I don't know.

01:17:26.692 --> 01:17:28.894
He was in that room.

01:17:28.994 --> 01:17:30.394
The one with
the broken-down truck.

01:17:30.228 --> 01:17:34.066
We just... we ran inside.

01:17:34.166 --> 01:17:36.201
Me, Rachel and Ben.

01:17:36.301 --> 01:17:37.301
Yeah.

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:42.274
When I turned around,
he wasn't there anymore. I tried to find him.

01:17:42.374 --> 01:17:45.254
I know you did. You went down the hall, right?
You walked down the hall.

01:17:45.243 --> 01:17:49.748
And you saw something
that scared you, right?

01:17:49.848 --> 01:17:51.848
I saw him.

01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:54.353
Yeah. Was it Ben?

01:17:54.453 --> 01:17:58.123
He was wearing a mask.

01:17:58.223 --> 01:18:00.158
He came after me.

01:18:00.258 --> 01:18:02.027
He grabbed me.

01:18:02.127 --> 01:18:03.795
And did you see
anything at all?

01:18:03.895 --> 01:18:05.397
Did you see
any defining marks?

01:18:05.497 --> 01:18:09.868
- I mean, it could be a scar, a tattoo.
- No.

01:18:09.968 --> 01:18:12.738
And he must've hit me,
because when I woke up,

01:18:12.838 --> 01:18:15.207
I didn't know where I was.
I was just in a room.

01:18:15.307 --> 01:18:17.309
I could see Rachel
through a crack,

01:18:17.409 --> 01:18:20.245
and she was fighting.

01:18:20.345 --> 01:18:22.314
And then,
she ran outside,

01:18:22.414 --> 01:18:24.349
and I saw
the welder's torch

01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:27.853
banging against
all the gas tanks.

01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:30.822
I broke through a window,
and I crawled out,

01:18:30.922 --> 01:18:33.808
and there was
an explosion.

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.129
I remember...

01:18:37.229 --> 01:18:40.132
Steven, he was
trying to scream,

01:18:40.232 --> 01:18:41.800
but he was choking.

01:18:41.900 --> 01:18:44.903
He just kept choking.

01:18:45.003 --> 01:18:46.872
There was so much blood,

01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:49.307
and everything
was burning.

01:18:49.407 --> 01:18:51.859
Wait a minute.
Steven was still alive?

01:18:55.897 --> 01:18:58.383
Please, I just wanna go home.

01:18:58.483 --> 01:18:59.883
Please.

01:19:00.852 --> 01:19:02.220
I know, I know.
You should go.

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.872
You've been through
enough.

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:12.747
We're gonna get him.

01:19:27.496 --> 01:19:29.414
- Hey.
- The autopsy report.

01:19:29.514 --> 01:19:31.750
I didn't finish yet.
After lunch.

01:19:31.850 --> 01:19:34.986
- Reese, where the hell...
- She saw him. He was alive.

01:19:35.086 --> 01:19:37.489
Saw who?
What are you talking about?

01:19:37.589 --> 01:19:41.109
- Are these the only bodies? - It'll take
another day or two to compile all the remains.

01:19:41.092 --> 01:19:44.196
- There was a kid, about 16, brown eyes.
- Yeah, right there.

01:19:44.296 --> 01:19:46.164
He put all the bodies
in the fuel house,

01:19:46.264 --> 01:19:48.333
then he blew them up
or dragged them into the fire.

01:19:48.433 --> 01:19:50.335
Leann was locked up,
but she managed to escape.

01:19:50.435 --> 01:19:52.386
So he moved the bodies.
We know that.

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:57.175
This body should be burned
beyond all recognition,

01:19:57.275 --> 01:19:59.277
but it wasn't because
he was still alive.

01:19:59.377 --> 01:20:00.617
Are you saying
he tried to run?

01:20:00.545 --> 01:20:02.380
Or he was trying
to hide something.

01:20:02.480 --> 01:20:04.680
- What are you guys looking for?
- What have you found?

01:20:04.482 --> 01:20:07.219
A deck of cards,
pack of marlboros,

01:20:07.319 --> 01:20:09.221
- some dice.
- Have you checked everywhere?

01:20:09.321 --> 01:20:11.481
- I said I have not finished yet.
- What have you got?

01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:13.325
- What are we looking for?
- Hold on.

01:20:13.425 --> 01:20:15.225
Oh, shit.

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:18.379
I need some forceps.

01:20:20.448 --> 01:20:22.528
- Communicate.
- You're gonna need some gloves, too.

01:20:22.601 --> 01:20:24.836
Basic communication.

01:20:24.936 --> 01:20:26.872
Four years gets me
more than this.

01:20:26.972 --> 01:20:28.452
She said he was
choking on something.

01:20:39.968 --> 01:20:41.168
What the hell?

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:50.878
Gabe, got the chip.
Go. It's ready.

01:20:52.414 --> 01:20:55.216
Spark it up.
Gonna clean this.

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:01.422
- Okay, go.
- Yeah.

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:05.626
Go to where it cut out.

01:21:19.207 --> 01:21:21.447
- Go back and clean it.
- I can't. The resolution sucks.

01:21:21.559 --> 01:21:23.929
- Let me...
- Yeah, yeah. Start.

01:21:24.029 --> 01:21:26.380
There's something
in those glitches.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:30.484
I see four frames
I need to extract.

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:36.875
- I almost got him.
- What are you doing?

01:21:36.975 --> 01:21:41.929
Increasing the d.P.I. Detail
and adding a de-blur filter.

01:21:47.335 --> 01:21:50.237
- That must be right when he got stabbed.
- Go to the next one.

01:21:58.446 --> 01:21:59.446
Shit.

01:22:02.083 --> 01:22:03.350
There's another one.

01:22:05.120 --> 01:22:08.006
He's taking off the mask.
Come on. Come on.

01:22:08.106 --> 01:22:09.423
There's one last one.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:16.964
Come on. It's too dark.
I can't see it.

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:25.739
There!

01:22:42.190 --> 01:22:43.942
The boyfriend.

01:22:44.042 --> 01:22:46.002
He has a broken heart.
That's a hell of a motive.

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:53.367
We got him.

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:08.066
I would like to inform you

01:23:08.166 --> 01:23:12.370
that we have just received
substantial video evidence

01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:15.273
that implicates Tyler Norris
in all of these crimes.

01:23:15.373 --> 01:23:18.410
It was nice
having you here today.

01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:21.279
If it was just
me and burquez,

01:23:21.379 --> 01:23:24.282
I would've died.

01:23:24.382 --> 01:23:26.484
What are you
gonna do now?

01:23:26.584 --> 01:23:29.184
I don't know.

01:23:29.754 --> 01:23:32.657
Finish my leave.

01:23:32.757 --> 01:23:35.209
I could use a holiday.

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:50.957
Stop it.

01:23:52.494 --> 01:23:53.979
Did you see something?

01:23:54.079 --> 01:23:55.729
Play it again.

01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:02.102
- This is Rachel's camera, right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:04.538
Again.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.476
The glitches, they...

01:24:10.612 --> 01:24:12.246
Play it again.

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:20.038
Timecode. Again.

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:21.473
What do you see
in here?

01:24:21.573 --> 01:24:23.424
Zoom in on the timecode.

01:24:25.627 --> 01:24:27.361
What are you
looking at?

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:34.185
The timecode
is not breaking...

01:24:34.285 --> 01:24:36.203
With the glitches.

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:49.067
Tyler Norris is currently
in custody in county hospital.

01:24:49.167 --> 01:24:52.170
His condition is critical,
but we will keep you posted

01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:54.072
as we get updates.

01:24:56.774 --> 01:25:01.046
I'd also like to take
a moment to mention

01:25:01.146 --> 01:25:03.730
that we were able
to accomplish this...

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:18.779
They're not glitches.

01:25:23.151 --> 01:25:25.319
They're edits.

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:29.088
Reese. Reese.

01:25:29.274 --> 01:25:31.594
<i>Word on a new video</i>
<i>that's just hit the web.</i>

01:25:30.909 --> 01:25:33.678
<i>They're outtakes</i>
<i>and deleted scenes</i>

01:25:33.778 --> 01:25:36.181
<i>of some kind.</i>

01:25:36.281 --> 01:25:37.682
<i>Sources are</i>
<i>still trying to...</i>

01:25:37.782 --> 01:25:39.217
What the hell
is going on?

01:25:39.317 --> 01:25:42.220
<i>...part of the earlier</i>
<i>released tapes.</i>

01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:45.190
<i>Yes, we can now confirm</i>
<i>the video is genuine,</i>

01:25:45.290 --> 01:25:46.807
<i>it is real.</i>

01:26:11.633 --> 01:26:14.486
