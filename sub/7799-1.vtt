01:31.390 --> 01:34.420

Would the one who thinks l'm
attractive please step forward?

01:39.150 --> 01:41.100
Quickly as possible!
Time is money!

01:41.350 --> 01:42.460
What'd you have in mind?

01:42.710 --> 01:45.670
VD l'm really into penicillin.

01:45.910 --> 01:47.100
Now that's funny!

01:49.790 --> 01:51.460
Actually, what l had in mind. . .

01:51.710 --> 01:54.900
. . .was spending the evening
with a stranger who loves me.

01:55.150 --> 01:56.790
lt's going to cost you $1 00.

01:57.030 --> 01:58.820
Oh, yeah?
What time do you get off work?

01:59.390 --> 02:00.420

Let's make it $200.
But l will ask you to Simoniz my car.

02:11.510 --> 02:13.500

02:13.710 --> 02:15.110
This is funny stuff here.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.830
Let's go.

02:22.110 --> 02:24.140
Bitterman, give her. . .

02:24.390 --> 02:26.860
. . .give her friend $1 00.
She came in second.

02:31.710 --> 02:33.220
Who is that guy?

02:33.470 --> 02:34.660
l'd rather not say.

02:34.910 --> 02:37.380
l think l know.
l saw his picture in the paper.

02:37.630 --> 02:39.740
-That's Arthur Bach, isn't it?
-What if it is?

02:39.990 --> 02:42.420
ls there something wrong with him?

02:45.630 --> 02:46.500
Yes.

02:58.390 --> 03:01.420
Permit me to introduce myself.

03:02.510 --> 03:04.420
Where in the hell's my hat?

03:04.630 --> 03:05.950
lt's on the floor.

03:06.150 --> 03:08.620
l hate it when that happens.

03:10.750 --> 03:12.820
l am Arthur.

03:13.110 --> 03:14.750
l'm Gloria.

03:16.950 --> 03:19.460
-l am Arthur.
-Yeah. What're you drinking?

03:19.710 --> 03:21.380
Scotch. Would you like some?

03:21.630 --> 03:22.460
Why not?

03:22.710 --> 03:25.300
You're with me and
you can ask that question?

03:33.470 --> 03:34.380
What's so funny now?

03:34.630 --> 03:37.540
l sometimes just
think funny things!

03:39.070 --> 03:40.630
What do you do for a living?

03:41.630 --> 03:44.020
l race cars. l play tennis...

03:44.230 --> 03:46.100
...l fondle women, but...

03:46.350 --> 03:50.060
...l have weekends off
and l am my own boss.

03:53.270 --> 03:55.940
The Plaza, and step on it!

03:56.190 --> 03:58.420
Sir, if l may say so. . . .

03:58.910 --> 04:00.820
Go through the park.

04:01.910 --> 04:03.860
You know how l love the park!

04:05.070 --> 04:06.710
Can l have another drink?

04:08.790 --> 04:10.300

04:11.110 --> 04:13.910

04:38.190 --> 04:39.540

04:49.710 --> 04:52.430

04:56.510 --> 04:57.910
Are you hurt, sir?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.150
l fell out of the car!

05:00.590 --> 05:02.860
lsn't that the funniest thing ever?

05:05.070 --> 05:06.740
You had to be there, right?

05:06.990 --> 05:08.580
You are quite amusing, sir.

05:08.950 --> 05:11.750
Please get my drink.
After all, we're going to the bar.

05:11.950 --> 05:14.100
Thank you so much.

05:22.550 --> 05:25.220
Madame, l'm sorry,
but we have absolutely no--

05:25.470 --> 05:27.740
Don't give me any stuff, buster!

05:27.990 --> 05:29.900
lt's all right,
the lady's with me.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.580
Mr. Bach! How good to see you!

05:32.830 --> 05:35.390
lf only someone
l knew felt that way!

05:36.390 --> 05:38.740
We have your regular table,
Mr. Bach.

05:38.950 --> 05:41.620
l know you have it,
but is anyone sitting at it?

05:49.350 --> 05:52.500
lt's all right. They're used
to seeing me with the turtle.

05:56.470 --> 05:59.980
Uncle Peter! And Aunt Pearl!

06:00.510 --> 06:01.380
You're looking well.

06:01.630 --> 06:02.460
Thank you!

06:03.910 --> 06:06.940
Aunt Pearl, may l say
you're looking younger every day.

06:07.190 --> 06:09.100
Doesn't Aunt Pearl
look wonderful, darling?

06:09.350 --> 06:11.020
She looks great.

06:11.310 --> 06:14.190
We haven't had the pleasure
of meeting this young woman.

06:14.430 --> 06:15.830
Would you introduce us?

06:16.070 --> 06:17.820
How stupid of me!

06:19.430 --> 06:23.340
Princess Gloria, may l
introduce my aunt and uncle. . .

06:23.590 --> 06:25.460
. . .Peter and Pearl Bach.

06:26.030 --> 06:27.300
How are you?

06:27.510 --> 06:29.620
Princess? Did you say
''Princess,'' Arthur?

06:32.030 --> 06:36.260
There's a very small country
in the West lndies. l mean small.

06:36.510 --> 06:38.070
l see. Thank you.

06:40.350 --> 06:43.620
lt's terribly small.
Tiny little country.

06:43.830 --> 06:46.100
Rhode lsland could
beat the crap out of it in a war.

06:46.350 --> 06:47.620
That's how small it is.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.100
lt's small.

06:51.030 --> 06:52.140
lt's very little. . . .

06:52.390 --> 06:56.300
lt's 85 cents in a cab
from one end to the other.

06:56.510 --> 06:57.860
l'm talking small!

06:58.110 --> 07:01.100
We understand it's small, Arthur.

07:02.910 --> 07:05.790
They recently had
the whole country carpeted.

07:06.070 --> 07:08.100
This is not a big place.

07:08.350 --> 07:11.100
We understand that it's small, Arthur.

07:11.350 --> 07:13.860
And we also understand
that you are very drunk.

07:14.110 --> 07:17.820
So why don't we meet again
when you're sober?

07:20.510 --> 07:23.420
Yeah, l'm sorry.
l can't help it.

07:23.630 --> 07:27.260
Grow up, Arthur.
You'd make a fine adult.

07:27.510 --> 07:28.660
That's easy for you to say.

07:28.910 --> 07:30.630
You haven't got
50 pairs of short pants. . .

07:30.830 --> 07:32.820
. . .hanging in your closet!

07:34.470 --> 07:37.580
lt's the regular table!
Wait a minute. . .

07:37.790 --> 07:40.430
. . .regular chair.

07:45.110 --> 07:47.100
How rich are you?

07:48.070 --> 07:50.060
All l can tell you is. . .

07:50.430 --> 07:53.230
. . .l wish l had a dime
for every dime l have.

07:53.790 --> 07:56.460
The service here is terrible.
Where the hell's my drink?

07:56.670 --> 07:59.820
-We just ordered!
-That's always their excuse.

08:00.670 --> 08:03.420
Engine room,
where the hell's my drink?!

08:04.510 --> 08:05.740
Are you married?

08:05.990 --> 08:09.460
There's only one woman for me.

08:10.230 --> 08:12.380
And l can't stand her.

08:12.790 --> 08:14.380
Her name is Susan.

08:14.590 --> 08:17.340
l can't tell you her last name.
lt would be indiscreet.

08:17.590 --> 08:18.780
Johnson.

08:19.190 --> 08:20.860
Susan Johnson.

08:21.110 --> 08:22.750
My father wants me to marry her. . .

08:22.950 --> 08:24.510
. . .but l'm not going to!

08:25.350 --> 08:28.620
You're the only woman at this table.

08:30.870 --> 08:33.429
Sure, you bring her a bottle,
me you bring a glass.

08:33.630 --> 08:35.659
Fine. Thank you very much.

08:36.230 --> 08:37.419
Aren't waiters wonderful?

08:37.630 --> 08:40.820
You ask them for things,
and they bring them.

08:42.230 --> 08:45.030
Same principle as Santa Claus.

08:48.950 --> 08:50.300
Tell me about yourself.

08:50.750 --> 08:53.470
You mean, why l'm a hooker?

08:53.950 --> 08:55.060
Are you a hooker?

08:55.990 --> 08:57.310
Jesus, l forgot!

08:57.510 --> 08:59.900
l thought l was
doing great with you.

09:04.470 --> 09:05.740
Why are you a hooker?

09:06.470 --> 09:08.260
My mother died when l was six.

09:09.430 --> 09:11.380
Son of a bitch!

09:13.870 --> 09:16.460
Don't they know
what they do to kids?!

09:16.670 --> 09:18.780
My father raped me when l was 1 2.

09:18.990 --> 09:21.710
So you had six
relatively good years.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.700
l'm sorry.

09:25.430 --> 09:28.420
Listen, my father screwed me too.

09:30.870 --> 09:31.820
Do you like me?

09:32.350 --> 09:33.750
You're cute.

09:34.030 --> 09:35.700
l know that!

09:35.950 --> 09:37.620
But do you like me?

09:40.150 --> 09:42.710
Well, Princess,
we're going to have fun!

09:43.670 --> 09:48.020
Tonight is New Year's Eve!
Third time this week!

09:48.670 --> 09:50.230
Here's to you!

09:53.910 --> 09:55.020
Noisy!

10:49.790 --> 10:51.380
Hello, darling.

10:51.910 --> 10:53.230
Good morning.

10:55.310 --> 10:56.420
Did you sleep well?

10:56.630 --> 10:57.740
-Fine.
-Good.

11:00.150 --> 11:02.060
Please stop that!

11:02.430 --> 11:04.300
Hobson how good to see you!

11:05.110 --> 11:06.700
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all.

11:06.910 --> 11:10.180
l've taken the liberty of
anticipating your condition. . .

11:10.430 --> 11:13.820
. . .and l've brought you orange juice,
coffee and aspirins.

11:14.030 --> 11:15.780
Or do you need to throw up?

11:20.350 --> 11:23.100
Gloria, l would like you
to meet Hobson.

11:23.350 --> 11:24.910
My best friend in the world.

11:25.190 --> 11:27.420
l relish the compliment.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.470
lt is thrilling to meet you, Gloria.

11:33.270 --> 11:37.780
You obviously have a wonderful
economy with words, Gloria.

11:39.710 --> 11:44.020
l look forward to your next
syllable with great eagerness.

11:51.990 --> 11:54.020
As we all can see,
it's a lovely day.

11:54.270 --> 11:57.230
Which would seem to indicate
that the night is over.

11:58.430 --> 12:01.820
l have arranged breakfast
for you on the east patio.

12:04.310 --> 12:07.140
This is a robe.
Please put it on.

12:07.830 --> 12:09.620
Say goodbye to her, Arthur.

12:31.310 --> 12:33.220
Do you know what
l'm going to do?

12:33.470 --> 12:34.870
No, l don't.

12:35.790 --> 12:37.620
l'm going to take a bath.

12:38.270 --> 12:39.990
l'll alert the media.

12:50.870 --> 12:53.220
Do you want to
run my bath for me?

12:53.630 --> 12:55.190
lt's what l live for.

13:07.790 --> 13:10.860
Perhaps you'd like me to
wash your dick for you. . .

13:11.110 --> 13:12.620
. . .you little shit.

13:14.430 --> 13:17.820
You'd better watch out
You'd better not cry

13:18.030 --> 13:21.580
You'd better not pout
l'm telling you why

13:22.230 --> 13:25.900
Santa Claus is coming to town

13:29.910 --> 13:31.550
Hobson, this is Arthur.

13:31.790 --> 13:34.060
Yes! How delightful
to hear from you.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.620
How about a pitcher of martinis?

13:36.870 --> 13:38.020
No, thank you.

13:38.270 --> 13:40.780
l'm not going
to face my father sober.

13:41.390 --> 13:43.820
lf you don't bring them
l'll have someone else do it!

13:44.070 --> 13:45.790
l'll bring them.

13:46.270 --> 13:47.830
-Say goodbye.
-Goodbye.

13:49.630 --> 13:51.380
He treats me like a kid.

14:12.950 --> 14:14.220
You know, Arthur. . .

14:14.590 --> 14:18.020
. . .your father is going
to demand that you marry Susan.

14:18.270 --> 14:20.140
l don't care what he demands.

14:22.230 --> 14:25.940
Stay with me a minute, Hobson.
You know l hate to be alone.

14:26.590 --> 14:30.060
Yes. Bathing is a lonely business.

14:31.150 --> 14:33.260
Except for fish.

14:34.310 --> 14:35.710
l beg your pardon?

14:37.110 --> 14:39.020
Did you say ''except for fish''?

14:39.870 --> 14:41.220
Fish all bathe together.

14:41.830 --> 14:44.390
Although they do tend
to eat one another.

14:44.990 --> 14:45.860
l often think. . .

14:46.070 --> 14:48.790
. . .fish must get
awfully tired of seafood.

14:49.110 --> 14:50.430
What are your thoughts, Hobson?

14:51.110 --> 14:52.510
Pardon me. . . .

15:03.670 --> 15:05.420
l don't want you to be alone.

15:05.630 --> 15:08.380
l'll never be alone.
l have you.

15:08.950 --> 15:11.340
lsn't life wonderful, Hobson?

15:11.590 --> 15:13.940
Yes, Arthur, it is.
Do your armpits.

15:14.150 --> 15:16.500
A hot bath is wonderful!

15:17.030 --> 15:19.340
Girls are wonderful!

15:19.550 --> 15:22.350
lmagine how wonderful
a girl who bathes would be!

15:22.590 --> 15:23.740
Get dressed!

15:34.590 --> 15:36.020
l hate it here.

15:36.270 --> 15:38.860
Of course you hate it.
People work here.

15:40.270 --> 15:43.180
Here, read this magazine.
There are many pictures.

15:44.150 --> 15:45.740
Look how nobody ever smiles here.

15:46.430 --> 15:47.860
Why doesn't anybody ever smile here?

15:48.150 --> 15:49.940
They smile at lunchtime.

15:51.390 --> 15:54.540
Lower your voice, Arthur.
And sit up.

15:57.750 --> 15:59.660
Stop being so nervous.

16:01.110 --> 16:03.860
Later on, we'll get ice cream.

16:08.350 --> 16:10.020
Your father will see you now.

16:14.430 --> 16:15.660
Come on, Hobson.

16:16.230 --> 16:17.900
He wants to see you alone.

16:25.710 --> 16:27.700
He gets all that money.

16:29.150 --> 16:32.220
Pays his family back
by being a stinking drunk.

16:32.990 --> 16:34.420
lt's enough to make you sick.

16:34.710 --> 16:37.820
l really wouldn't know, sir.
l'm just a servant.

16:39.070 --> 16:40.580
On the other hand. . .

16:40.790 --> 16:42.270
. . .go screw yourself.

16:47.350 --> 16:50.230
The press has a good time
with you, Arthur.

16:54.150 --> 16:56.500
''Millionaire Drunk Playboy. ''

16:59.190 --> 17:01.260
You're the weakest man
l've ever known!

17:01.910 --> 17:03.700
l despise your weakness!

17:07.030 --> 17:08.940
l'm afraid we have to talk.

17:11.589 --> 17:15.020
l'm not going to marry her!
l've told you a thousand times!

17:15.270 --> 17:19.260
Fine. lf that's your decision,
the family has no choice.

17:19.829 --> 17:21.900
l'm sorry, Arthur, very sorry.

17:22.150 --> 17:25.030
But as of this moment, you are. . .

17:25.230 --> 17:26.140
. . .cut off.

17:26.750 --> 17:28.540
You mean cut off from. . .

17:28.790 --> 17:30.460
. . .you and Grandmother
and the family?

17:35.230 --> 17:37.020
So you mean cut off
from the. . . .

17:40.390 --> 17:41.820
You don't mean cut off from the--

17:42.030 --> 17:43.700
The money, Arthur.

17:46.870 --> 17:49.830
Your grandmother and l have had
all the papers drawn up.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.830
We want this marriage, Arthur.

17:52.070 --> 17:53.710
l want it. Burt Johnson wants it.

17:53.910 --> 17:55.230
Burt Johnson!

17:55.710 --> 17:57.030
He's a criminal!

17:57.470 --> 17:59.220
We all are, Arthur.

17:59.430 --> 18:00.940
And as you know. . .

18:02.030 --> 18:04.940
. . .we usually get what we want.

18:05.470 --> 18:07.140
Frankly, Father,
l'd rather starve.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.300
And l will.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.030
l'll get married when
l fall in love.

18:12.270 --> 18:14.700
Fine. l respect your integrity.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.620
You've just lost
750 million dollars.

18:18.710 --> 18:20.940
Actually, Susan is
a very nice girl.

18:22.270 --> 18:23.990
And she'll make a wonderful wife.

18:24.310 --> 18:25.900
Yes, wonderful.

18:27.670 --> 18:29.620
Have you ever seen her face. . .

18:30.870 --> 18:32.860
. . .when the light
catches it just right?

18:33.190 --> 18:34.860
She's really quite beautiful.

18:35.630 --> 18:38.220
Of course, you can't depend
on that light.

18:38.470 --> 18:40.820
The wedding is a month from today.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.820
The invitations will be
mailed tonight.

18:44.070 --> 18:45.820
Ever taste her chicken?

18:47.190 --> 18:50.860
She does spectacular
things with a chicken.

18:52.150 --> 18:54.740
And l love a chicken made at home.

18:56.710 --> 18:59.820
This is the ring your grandfather
gave to your grandmother.

19:00.190 --> 19:01.910
She wants you to
give it to Susan.

19:04.150 --> 19:06.180
This is to marry one girl?

19:07.470 --> 19:08.420
Don't do this to me.

19:08.630 --> 19:11.900
l've been waiting for you
to grow up. l can't wait any longer.

19:13.470 --> 19:15.700
Congratulations, Father, you win.

19:15.910 --> 19:18.340
l had every intention of winning.

19:18.630 --> 19:20.350
Congratulations to you, Arthur.

19:20.590 --> 19:23.180
You're going to be wealthy
for the rest of your life.

19:23.390 --> 19:25.260
That's all l've ever wanted to be.

19:32.790 --> 19:35.900
l'll take three dozen of these shirts.
Assorted colors.

19:36.190 --> 19:37.300
l hate my father.

19:37.550 --> 19:39.580
Then purchase four dozen.

19:40.350 --> 19:41.700
Four dozen.

19:43.110 --> 19:43.940
And l want. . .

19:44.230 --> 19:46.620
. . . 1 4 of these sweaters, all green.

19:46.830 --> 19:48.420
-All green?
-l don't wear sweaters.

19:48.870 --> 19:50.430
Send them to
my address, will you?

19:52.670 --> 19:54.660
What else can l buy, Hobson?

20:02.110 --> 20:04.180
Hobson! Did you see that?!

20:06.830 --> 20:07.900
She stole that tie!

20:08.110 --> 20:10.460
lt's a perfect crime!
Girls don't wear ties.

20:11.230 --> 20:14.420
Although some do. lt's not a perfect
crime, but it's a good crime.

20:14.670 --> 20:17.500
lf she murdered the tie
it'd be a perfect crime.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.420
Why are you so happy
about all this?

20:20.830 --> 20:22.860
The man following her
is a security guard.

20:23.110 --> 20:24.460
We've got to be calm!

20:24.830 --> 20:26.550
lsn't she beautiful? Jesus!

20:26.790 --> 20:29.260
May l ask what have
we to do with this?

21:08.750 --> 21:09.940
l beg your pardon, miss.

21:10.190 --> 21:12.460
l'm the security guard
in the store.

21:13.590 --> 21:14.500
You don't need the badge.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.980
No customer would
wear that jacket.

21:18.430 --> 21:19.750
l must look in the bag.

21:19.990 --> 21:21.630
l saw you put something in it.

21:24.390 --> 21:26.220
You got trouble, mister.

21:26.550 --> 21:29.300
You'll never work on the East Coast
again. What's your name?

21:29.510 --> 21:30.700
She's sensational!

21:30.950 --> 21:33.590
She does have a certain
Eleanor Roosevelt quality.

21:33.830 --> 21:35.020
What's your address?

21:35.590 --> 21:37.540
The address, Chester!
l'm not fooling!

21:37.830 --> 21:39.620
l saw you put a tie in that bag!

21:39.830 --> 21:41.150
What did you say?!

21:41.910 --> 21:43.700
All right, that's it!
l want a cop!

21:43.950 --> 21:45.620
Get me a cop!
We need a cop here!

21:45.870 --> 21:47.540
Don't move from where you are.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.300
l don't want you out of my sight!

21:49.550 --> 21:51.190
Get me a cop!
Get your hands off me.

21:52.150 --> 21:54.060
l'm Arthur Bach.
l'll straighten this out.

21:54.270 --> 21:56.990
Mr. Bach, you really should
stay out of this.

21:57.190 --> 21:59.060
Well, he's in it, Chester.
Tell him, Alfred.

22:00.150 --> 22:02.300
l know this woman.
We're shopping together.

22:02.550 --> 22:03.660
Where the hell have you been?

22:03.910 --> 22:05.470
l'm sorry darling.
l got caught up.

22:05.670 --> 22:06.700
She's a friend, Mr. Bach?

22:06.910 --> 22:09.630
He just said that, Chester.
You're such a schmuck.

22:10.190 --> 22:11.540
l asked her to pick out a tie.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.340
l was going to put it on my bill.

22:13.590 --> 22:16.020
-You didn't pay for it?
-l forgot. l'm sorry.

22:17.790 --> 22:20.820
Chester, what can l say?
l had no idea.

22:21.070 --> 22:22.790
May l look at the tie?

22:28.830 --> 22:31.020
Oh, God, that's really lovely.

22:31.270 --> 22:34.020
-l hope you like it.
-You're really wonderful.

22:38.350 --> 22:40.140
Not in front of
all these people, dear.

22:40.430 --> 22:41.750
They might think you're an animal.

22:41.990 --> 22:43.660
Mr. Bach, you understand,
it's my job.

22:44.030 --> 22:46.830
Would you ask the lady at
the counter to put this on my bill?

22:48.390 --> 22:50.900
l'll take care of it, Mr. Bach.
Thank you very much.

23:00.950 --> 23:02.270
Were you scared?

23:08.190 --> 23:10.220
Why are you smiling
at me like that?

23:12.390 --> 23:13.260
l see.

23:13.750 --> 23:15.230
You're a little strange. . .

23:15.470 --> 23:16.700
. . .but cute.
How are you?

23:18.230 --> 23:22.020
Have a nice day. Thank you very much.
l'll go to the bus stop now.

23:24.670 --> 23:26.100
Why did you steal that tie?

23:26.790 --> 23:27.980
l don't know.

23:28.230 --> 23:29.660
l'm a wonderful person!

23:30.790 --> 23:32.020
l'm serious.

23:32.830 --> 23:35.180
l'll be with you in a minute.
He's getting on my nerves.

23:38.270 --> 23:40.380
Will you stop smiling
at me like that?

23:40.990 --> 23:43.220
You look like
one of Santa's helpers.

23:44.910 --> 23:45.700
ls he with us?

23:45.950 --> 23:48.620
My name is Arthur,
and this is Mr. Hobson.

23:48.870 --> 23:50.270
Good afternoon.

23:51.590 --> 23:53.260
Good afternoon?

23:54.070 --> 23:55.790
My name is Linda.

23:56.830 --> 24:00.340
l'd like to thank you very much.
You did a nice thing.

24:00.590 --> 24:02.420
That was an interesting kiss.

24:03.510 --> 24:06.230
-You kiss your wife like that?
-l'm not married.

24:08.830 --> 24:12.980
Keep smiling. 688-5549.

24:13.550 --> 24:15.270
Don't expect big things
on the first date.

24:15.510 --> 24:18.150
Yes, it's been a distinct
pleasure meeting you.

24:18.390 --> 24:20.620
Arthur, we really must be going.

24:20.830 --> 24:22.820
Thank you for
a memorable afternoon.

24:23.030 --> 24:27.230
Usually one must go to a bowling alley
to meet a woman of your stature.

24:28.390 --> 24:29.710
Wouldn't it be funny
if he called me?

24:30.150 --> 24:34.030
Arthur, l see no reason
for prolonging this conversation.

24:34.230 --> 24:35.500
Unless you're planning. . .

24:35.710 --> 24:38.620
. . .to knock over a fruit stand
later in the evening.

24:38.910 --> 24:40.390
Good luck in prison.

24:42.590 --> 24:43.660
Who was the tie for?

24:44.070 --> 24:45.220
A guy.

24:45.470 --> 24:48.380
Look how he stopped smiling.
My father. lt's his birthday.

24:48.670 --> 24:49.860
What are you doing tomorrow night?

24:51.230 --> 24:52.180
l don't know.

24:52.630 --> 24:54.300
l have plans for tomorrow night.
What should l wear?

24:54.510 --> 24:56.150
Steal something casual.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.020
-l like him.
-Likewise, l'm sure.

25:00.230 --> 25:03.060
l'll have Bitterman
drive you home.

25:04.830 --> 25:06.150
You don't have to do that.

25:06.390 --> 25:08.420
Bitterman doesn't
have to take me.

25:12.550 --> 25:15.220
l really hardly ever
take the bus, ever.

25:16.190 --> 25:19.020
-But it's so hard to get a cab.
-Of course.

25:20.630 --> 25:22.300
l'm sure we know a lot
of the same people.

25:22.550 --> 25:24.060
-Get in.
-Right.

25:27.230 --> 25:30.110
Tell Bitterman where to take you.
And make sure. . .

25:30.590 --> 25:32.980
. . .you give him your address
and phone number.

25:34.790 --> 25:36.620
Take care of her, Bitterman.

25:38.950 --> 25:39.940
Good afternoon!

25:49.110 --> 25:51.220
You'd think they'd never
seen a car before.

25:51.430 --> 25:52.830
Hey lady, where
did you get the car?

25:53.070 --> 25:55.870
Could you children please
allow us our privacy?

25:59.750 --> 26:02.100
Could l sit here until
one of my neighbors walks by?

26:02.590 --> 26:04.980
l want someone l know
to see me get out of this.

26:05.310 --> 26:06.180
l understand.

26:08.190 --> 26:11.070
Here comes Mrs. Nesbit.
This should kill her.

26:11.430 --> 26:13.300
Don't touch the door.
l'll do it.

26:14.270 --> 26:17.620
Mrs. Nesbit deserves
the entire treatment.

26:24.710 --> 26:26.110
Thank you, Bitterman.

26:27.510 --> 26:28.830
Well, hello, Mrs. Nesbit!

26:29.510 --> 26:31.020
Will that be all, madam?

26:31.270 --> 26:32.380
l think so.

26:32.990 --> 26:34.580
Have a nice evening, Mrs. Nesbit.

26:40.030 --> 26:42.420
-Could be a big tie.
-lt is a tie.

26:43.070 --> 26:45.420
Then guessing would be
out of the question.

26:47.590 --> 26:49.310
-lt is a tie!
-Surprise!

26:50.230 --> 26:51.630
l love it!

26:53.950 --> 26:56.020
lt goes with everything l own.

26:56.710 --> 26:57.500
l hope you like it.

26:57.710 --> 27:01.220
lf l don't get a job soon, you may
get it back on your birthday.

27:02.870 --> 27:04.020
Dad, shut up.

27:05.310 --> 27:07.620
A funny thing happened
to me today.

27:08.870 --> 27:10.430
Do you know why. . .

27:10.670 --> 27:12.860
. . .girls marry so badly?

27:14.750 --> 27:16.740
ls this a joke?
Are these Polish girls?

27:19.670 --> 27:23.300
The reason is, there
are so many girls. . .

27:26.590 --> 27:28.380
. . .and so few princes.

27:30.910 --> 27:32.180
You met a prince?

27:32.830 --> 27:35.500
l met a nice guy. With my help,
he could become a prince.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.470
-Who is he?
-Just a guy.

27:37.710 --> 27:38.900
What does he do?

27:40.670 --> 27:41.780
Nothing.

27:43.870 --> 27:47.220
Another beauty.
How does he make a living?

27:48.710 --> 27:50.110
Look, l have to make dinner.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.060
l take it this bum
will be calling you.

27:56.230 --> 27:57.460
Dad, he's a millionaire.

27:57.870 --> 28:00.220
You have my permission
to marry him.

28:00.710 --> 28:02.220
Roses. Yellow.

28:02.470 --> 28:04.980
She'll drop dead. She'll love them.

28:06.110 --> 28:07.590
Yellow roses. Two dozen.

28:08.830 --> 28:10.470
l think something else
would look nice too.

28:12.230 --> 28:13.950
Red roses. With the yellow.

28:14.270 --> 28:16.300
She won't know what hit her!
You'll be aces with her.

28:17.430 --> 28:18.540
You're a nice boy.

28:18.790 --> 28:20.220
Two dozen red, okay?

28:20.790 --> 28:23.380
-Do you know what happened?
-No, l don't.

28:23.630 --> 28:25.660
Yesterday l met her
outside Bergdorf's.

28:26.910 --> 28:28.780
l can't stop
thinking about her!

28:29.590 --> 28:30.620
Are you married?

28:31.030 --> 28:32.350
Once. She's alive.

28:32.950 --> 28:35.830
-What's that?
-A yucca plant.

28:36.030 --> 28:37.670
-l'll take it.
-How many?

28:38.230 --> 28:39.140
Four.

28:39.350 --> 28:41.820
Where were you
when l was selling cars?

28:42.190 --> 28:43.750
How did you know
when you fell in love?

28:43.990 --> 28:45.310
How does anybody know?

28:45.670 --> 28:46.860
l was on a train.

28:47.110 --> 28:48.380
From Washington to New York.

28:48.590 --> 28:49.540
What's that?

28:49.790 --> 28:51.660
-A fern. You need five.
-Right!

28:52.110 --> 28:56.180
A girl got on the train.
Skinny. She gave me a smile.

28:56.670 --> 28:58.900
By Baltimore, l was a dead duck.

28:59.590 --> 29:02.340
Did you whistle a lot?
l find l whistle!

29:02.630 --> 29:03.660
l whistled.

29:05.950 --> 29:08.180
Did you feel funny?
l feel funny.

29:09.510 --> 29:10.940
You may have a cold.

29:13.790 --> 29:17.620
Send all this and anything else
you can think of to this address.

29:19.230 --> 29:20.870
Send 2 dozen roses
to your wife.

29:21.110 --> 29:22.540
The skinny one on the train.

29:22.790 --> 29:24.020
Here, keep the change.

29:25.470 --> 29:26.420
You're the rich one?

29:26.990 --> 29:28.180
The one who drinks?

29:29.950 --> 29:32.510
How does it feel
to have all that money?

29:33.310 --> 29:34.790
lt feels great.

29:37.350 --> 29:39.180
A dumb question.

29:40.030 --> 29:41.820
What do you do?
l've never asked.

29:42.030 --> 29:45.300
l'm an actress.
l mean, l'm studying to be one.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.100
But l'm working as a waitress.

29:48.350 --> 29:50.140
A lot of talented girls do that.

29:50.950 --> 29:52.350
What's it like being a waitress?

29:52.590 --> 29:54.460
lt's fun. l mean, you know.

29:58.470 --> 30:00.620
This guy came in and pulled out--

30:06.790 --> 30:10.020
A guy came into the diner
and pulled out--

30:18.590 --> 30:21.020
-He pulled out what?
-Pulled out a gun!

30:25.950 --> 30:26.900
l love this song!

30:27.150 --> 30:28.630
l love it too!

30:36.830 --> 30:37.940
When do l get a turn?

30:38.190 --> 30:40.700
Can't you see l'm going
for a new world's record?

30:40.990 --> 30:44.020
After only 1 2 games,
l have 80 coupons!

30:45.550 --> 30:48.820
l knew it would be different
spending an evening with a millionaire.

30:51.070 --> 30:54.780
Two more and l'm 20 for 20!
That's another 35 coupons!

30:56.550 --> 30:59.220
Could we have a little quiet here?

31:00.550 --> 31:01.980
You nut!

31:07.230 --> 31:08.660
Look at him with his gun.

31:10.470 --> 31:12.030
Are you cute!

31:16.190 --> 31:17.590
God, l missed!

31:17.790 --> 31:18.580
Nineteen.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.900
For 1 9, you get 1 5 coupons.

31:27.710 --> 31:29.300
We really have to go now.

31:34.390 --> 31:35.870
Space lnvaders!

31:42.630 --> 31:44.700
Do you want the orange one?

31:46.270 --> 31:47.220
Enjoy it!

31:47.910 --> 31:49.260
Now take care of it.

31:49.510 --> 31:50.700
l already named it!

31:50.910 --> 31:54.820
l named it after my grandmother
on my mother's side.

31:55.230 --> 31:56.500
Arthur.

32:01.950 --> 32:04.140
Here's a rose.
l stole it from the restaurant.

32:06.470 --> 32:07.620
Thank you.

32:08.990 --> 32:11.060
l've never taken care of anyone.

32:11.870 --> 32:14.780
Everyone's always taken care of me.

32:16.030 --> 32:18.910
But if you got sick, or anything. . .

32:20.390 --> 32:21.740
. . .l'd take care of you.

32:22.910 --> 32:24.390
Then l'll get sick.

32:39.550 --> 32:42.620
This Vermeer just arrived today.

32:44.350 --> 32:45.670
lt's called. . .

32:46.470 --> 32:49.460
. . . ''Woman Admiring Pearls. ''

32:50.230 --> 32:53.220
The dealer jerked me around
on the price a little.

32:53.470 --> 32:55.260
But what the hell.

32:55.470 --> 32:56.660
We live once.

33:01.150 --> 33:02.420
Martha. . . .

33:04.830 --> 33:06.700
What's the matter, Arthur?

33:10.270 --> 33:12.620
l can't marry Susan Johnson.

33:14.270 --> 33:16.990
-Really?
-l met this girl!

33:18.270 --> 33:22.100
You are a charming boy.
Unfortunately. . .

33:22.310 --> 33:25.660
. . .every time you have an erection,
it makes the papers.

33:27.230 --> 33:30.900
Goodness!
l sound like a dime novel.

33:32.470 --> 33:33.740
Peanuts!

33:38.630 --> 33:41.620
lsn't my grandson handsome, Harriet?

33:41.870 --> 33:43.620
-Yes.
-Thank you, Harriet.

33:47.270 --> 33:49.780
ls it wonderful to be. . .

33:50.950 --> 33:51.980
. . .promiscuous?

33:53.630 --> 33:56.820
At your age, Martha,
it might just be dangerous.

34:03.150 --> 34:04.870
Who is she? This one you met.

34:06.470 --> 34:08.139
l don't know.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.940
She lives in Queens.
She's nobody.

34:12.989 --> 34:15.420
But there's something
about her, Martha.

34:22.830 --> 34:24.469
Make no mistakes.

34:25.630 --> 34:28.540
You are too old to be poor.

34:28.870 --> 34:31.260
You don't know how.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.820
We are ruthless people.

34:34.110 --> 34:36.380
Don't screw with us.

34:38.630 --> 34:39.739
Arthur, l love you.

34:39.949 --> 34:43.340
lf you don't marry Susan
l'll cut you off without a cent.

34:46.790 --> 34:49.300
You're a scary old broad, Martha.

34:50.389 --> 34:53.300
And you are a delightful child.

34:54.830 --> 34:58.900
Marry Susan and cheat
with the nobody from Queens.

35:11.710 --> 35:14.020
How are you?
l got off work early.

35:14.230 --> 35:16.380
Listen, do you like lasagna?

35:16.870 --> 35:18.860
-Yeah.
-Oh, thank God.

35:21.510 --> 35:23.420
l know this is last minute. . .

35:24.950 --> 35:27.100
. . .but something came up.
l can't make it tonight.

35:27.710 --> 35:29.620
Fine. No problem. What?

35:30.790 --> 35:32.860
Listen, the truth is. . .

35:33.430 --> 35:35.070
. . .l'm getting engaged tonight.

35:35.950 --> 35:38.260
The easiest thing would be
to lie, but l like you--

35:38.510 --> 35:41.540
Look, no sweat.
We had some laughs. Good luck. . . .

35:41.750 --> 35:43.740
l wanted to tell you
the other night, but l--

35:43.950 --> 35:46.910
Don't worry about it.
l have to go. Okay? Bye.

35:55.030 --> 35:56.220
Would you like a beer?
l'll get you a beer.

35:56.430 --> 35:58.460
l'll be all right, sweetheart.

35:59.230 --> 36:01.950
l just have to be
alone for a minute.

36:02.470 --> 36:04.660
Oh, God! l can't bear it.

36:06.150 --> 36:07.380
Come in.

36:09.870 --> 36:11.590
Shall l get the car, Mr. Bach?

36:12.030 --> 36:13.100
No thanks, Bitterman.

36:14.030 --> 36:16.540
Tonight l'll drive myself.

36:17.270 --> 36:19.380
How often does
a young man get engaged?

36:20.230 --> 36:21.020
Where's Mr. Hobson?

36:21.670 --> 36:24.940
Mr. Hobson was tired, sir.
He's resting.

36:25.470 --> 36:27.220
He's been tired
quite a bit lately.

36:27.790 --> 36:29.510
l'm sure he's fine, sir.

36:40.230 --> 36:41.500
Will you cut it out?

36:42.830 --> 36:45.820
l didn't mean to tell you,
but l've got a tumor.

36:46.030 --> 36:47.300
Did the lights go off?

36:47.550 --> 36:49.190
Just talk to me, okay?

36:49.830 --> 36:51.420
With a tumor in my head?

36:52.710 --> 36:54.140
Listen, Arthur.

36:57.190 --> 37:00.260
There are three books. . . .
This is important.

37:01.190 --> 37:02.620
Take them back. . .

37:03.830 --> 37:05.100
. . .to the library.

37:12.790 --> 37:16.060
Don't die anymore.
lt's getting very boring.

37:16.670 --> 37:19.740
l've only got a cold.
Now go and get engaged.

37:21.070 --> 37:24.060
l just told Linda
l was getting engaged.

37:24.270 --> 37:25.750
l don't know why.

37:25.990 --> 37:29.620
A tart like that could
save you a fortune in prostitutes.

37:30.430 --> 37:31.750
Listen, old man.

37:32.710 --> 37:35.140
Don't ever talk about
her that way again.

37:35.390 --> 37:37.540
She's the best person l know!

37:37.790 --> 37:40.620
Goddamn it,
why are you such a snob?!

37:59.590 --> 38:02.740
l raised my voice to you.
l've never done that before.

38:02.990 --> 38:04.550
That's quite all right.

38:06.270 --> 38:08.620
You know, you may be growing up.

38:09.990 --> 38:12.630
And l'm sorry for what
l said about Linda.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.020
Do you want anything?

38:17.030 --> 38:18.540
l want to be younger.

38:18.790 --> 38:21.100
l'm sorry.
lt's your job to be older.

39:37.710 --> 39:40.430
-Good evening, Mr. Bach.
-Good evening, Mr. Butler.

39:40.670 --> 39:42.310
l'm here to get engaged.

39:42.550 --> 39:44.220
Won't you come in, sir?

39:45.670 --> 39:46.940
How are you?

39:48.990 --> 39:51.790
Susan! You get down here
this minute!

39:52.430 --> 39:55.620
Miss Susan is expecting you.
She's dressing.

39:56.070 --> 39:57.900
l will inform her you're here.

39:58.150 --> 40:00.660
Tell her Chief lnspector Flanigan
from homicide is here.

40:00.910 --> 40:03.020
That should get her
down in a hurry.

40:05.030 --> 40:07.300
Nothing. Offer to take my coat.

40:07.510 --> 40:09.150
You don't have a coat.

40:09.670 --> 40:11.620
Well, offer to take my tie.

40:14.150 --> 40:15.580
lt's a little joke.

40:16.430 --> 40:17.830
Take the rest of the week off.

40:18.030 --> 40:20.020
You're obviously
under a lot of tension.

40:20.230 --> 40:22.140
Would you care to wait
in the library?

40:22.350 --> 40:25.020
Yes! The bathroom is
out of the question!

40:28.870 --> 40:30.820
That's another little joke.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.380
Follow me, please.

40:34.270 --> 40:37.620
l'm a little nervous.
l'm getting engaged.

40:38.430 --> 40:39.910
You may wait in here.

40:40.110 --> 40:41.020
Thank you!

40:41.670 --> 40:45.420
ls there anything you
care for while you wait?

40:45.750 --> 40:49.220
Do you have today's Pravda ?
l like to keep up with Russia.

40:51.590 --> 40:53.070
Then fill a glass with scotch.

40:53.310 --> 40:56.420
Are you sure you want
to be a nightclub comic?

41:04.110 --> 41:07.420
Marty, he's pouring a drink.
l'll get back to you!

41:10.310 --> 41:14.300
lf you're going to be like that,
let's call the whole thing off!

41:14.550 --> 41:16.110
God, these people!

41:17.070 --> 41:20.220
l'm glad we had this time together.
You're a funny guy.

41:20.470 --> 41:22.060
You have that trouble too?

41:31.990 --> 41:34.820
This must be awfully
embarrassing for you.

41:46.710 --> 41:47.500
Hello, Arthur.

41:48.030 --> 41:49.180
Hello, Mr. Johnson.

41:49.750 --> 41:51.310
l haven't seen you lately.

41:53.030 --> 41:55.420
The reason you haven't
seen me is because. . .

41:55.630 --> 41:58.740
. . .l normally pick Susan up
at her apartment in town.

41:58.990 --> 42:01.420
And you live here.
Want a drink?

42:01.630 --> 42:03.110
l never drink.

42:04.070 --> 42:06.180
-No one in my family drinks.
-That's great!

42:06.390 --> 42:09.780
You probably never run out
of ice your whole life.

42:11.430 --> 42:15.260
l don't drink because drinking
affects your decision-making.

42:15.510 --> 42:18.310
You may be right.
l can't decide.

42:21.310 --> 42:23.420
That's just a little humor.

42:24.070 --> 42:25.820
Where's the rest
of this moose?

42:26.150 --> 42:29.620
Arthur, l think it's time
we got to know one another.

42:29.830 --> 42:32.660
l do too. That's why
l had you come over today.

42:33.830 --> 42:35.180
This is a tough room.

42:35.430 --> 42:37.620
l don't have to tell you that.

42:37.830 --> 42:39.470
You must have hated this moose.

42:39.710 --> 42:43.260
Why don't you forget
the moose for a moment?!

42:46.510 --> 42:47.740
Right.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.220
You know. . .

42:53.470 --> 42:55.900
. . .l didn't inherit money
like you did.

42:56.150 --> 42:57.820
l started with nothing.

42:58.830 --> 42:59.740
And yet. . .

43:00.830 --> 43:03.470
. . .l was a millionaire
by the time l was 1 8.

43:04.390 --> 43:07.220
Anyone stood in my way,
they got hurt.

43:10.550 --> 43:12.660
When l was 1 1 years old. . .

43:13.790 --> 43:15.190
. . .l killed a man.

43:17.470 --> 43:21.260
When you're 1 1 , you don't even
know there's a law against that.

43:21.870 --> 43:23.460
ls Susan here?

43:23.710 --> 43:26.670
l knew what l was doing.
We were poor.

43:28.430 --> 43:31.620
He came into our house
to steal our food.

43:31.870 --> 43:33.860
Well, he was asking for it.

43:35.710 --> 43:37.220
l took a knife. . .

43:38.110 --> 43:40.420
. . .and l killed him
in the kitchen.

43:43.310 --> 43:45.620
You probably ate out that night.

43:45.870 --> 43:48.750
l mean, with that man
lying in your kitchen.

43:49.030 --> 43:52.580
-You seem to find humor in everything.
-Yes, sorry.

43:52.790 --> 43:53.900
-Arthur!
-What?

43:55.070 --> 43:58.620
Do you know what l consider to be
my most precious possession?

44:00.470 --> 44:02.110
My daughter.

44:03.030 --> 44:04.220
She is my gold.

44:04.710 --> 44:07.620
-She is my treasure.
-She's very nice.

44:07.870 --> 44:10.300
And l protect what's mine.

44:11.270 --> 44:13.990
And l do it in an ugly way.

44:16.270 --> 44:20.100
-l'm from the gutter.
-l understand. The gutter.

44:20.350 --> 44:21.540
You seem upset.

44:21.790 --> 44:23.620
Now, Susan loves you.

44:24.910 --> 44:27.220
And l want you to make her happy.

44:27.710 --> 44:30.180
You can count on it.

44:30.510 --> 44:33.180
l insist upon you making her happy.

44:35.510 --> 44:37.020
Listen.

44:38.630 --> 44:40.460
What happens. . .

44:40.710 --> 44:42.300
. . .this is just hypothetical. . .

44:42.510 --> 44:46.300
. . .if l don't make her happy?
Which is out of the question!

44:46.630 --> 44:49.220
But let's just say. . .

44:49.470 --> 44:51.030
. . .l make her. . .

44:51.230 --> 44:52.580
. . .cranky?

44:53.550 --> 44:57.020
For cranky, l guess you'd
probably just break my ankles.

44:57.710 --> 44:59.110
Something like that.

44:59.990 --> 45:01.550
You'll make her happy.

45:01.750 --> 45:03.470
l don't like your drinking.

45:04.070 --> 45:05.980
lt makes you unreasonable.

45:08.150 --> 45:09.550
l want you to go to work.

45:09.910 --> 45:13.820
Now, your father and l
talked about it. l want you. . .

45:14.310 --> 45:15.820
. . .to work for me.

45:16.070 --> 45:19.030
ls this it?
She's not happy already?

45:19.350 --> 45:20.910
Susan loves you.

45:21.150 --> 45:22.500
So l love you.

45:22.750 --> 45:24.900
You'll find me a friend.

45:25.630 --> 45:27.220
Don't you get it?

45:27.670 --> 45:28.860
You can get drunk.

45:29.190 --> 45:30.420
You can throw up.

45:30.630 --> 45:33.020
You can forget to call me
for months.

45:33.270 --> 45:34.940
You can't lose with me.

45:35.510 --> 45:37.300
l know you too well.

45:37.550 --> 45:39.620
And l'm much stronger
than you are.

45:41.190 --> 45:43.460
l know how alone you are.

45:44.350 --> 45:46.300
l hate how alone you are.

45:46.790 --> 45:49.380
l've cried because
you're so alone.

45:51.110 --> 45:52.750
Don't be afraid, Arthur.

45:53.990 --> 45:56.420
You're never going
to be alone again.

45:57.190 --> 45:58.510
Waiter!

45:59.110 --> 46:01.460
l'll have another.
You want another fish?

46:01.710 --> 46:02.980
Don't drink anymore.

46:06.550 --> 46:07.950
You're such an asshole!

46:11.030 --> 46:12.460
This is what l am!

46:13.670 --> 46:16.230
Everyone who drinks
is not a poet.

46:18.470 --> 46:21.380
Some of us drink
because we're not poets.

46:23.030 --> 46:25.750
A real woman could
stop you from drinking.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.940
lt'd have to be a real big woman.

46:29.550 --> 46:30.900
Will you take my hand?

46:31.110 --> 46:33.020
That would leave you with one!

46:33.630 --> 46:35.660
Sorry. Here's the hand.

46:37.910 --> 46:39.630
l love you, Arthur.

46:40.230 --> 46:43.110
Good! l have to talk
to the waiter now.

46:43.710 --> 46:47.340
My doctor advised me to
drink 1 0 of these an hour.

46:47.590 --> 46:49.540
l understand, Mr. Bach.

47:09.310 --> 47:13.020
This is the ring my grandfather
gave to my grandmother.

47:14.110 --> 47:16.340
Then he died.

47:16.590 --> 47:19.150
And subsequently,
she gave it to me.

47:19.350 --> 47:21.340
l'll always love you.

47:22.070 --> 47:23.740
lt's a great ring, isn't it?

47:24.030 --> 47:25.620
lt's a beautiful ring.

47:26.790 --> 47:28.430
lt's a magical night.

47:31.510 --> 47:34.940
Do you have any objection
to naming a child Vladimir?

47:35.790 --> 47:36.740
Even a girl?

47:37.190 --> 47:38.830
Ask me.

47:41.470 --> 47:44.110
Will you marry me?
Take the weekend if you want.

47:45.110 --> 47:46.590
Congratulations!

47:50.030 --> 47:53.060
Would you mind if l took you home?

47:53.670 --> 47:56.420
l've got a terrible headache.
l'm sorry.

48:33.670 --> 48:35.580
This must be the building.

48:56.870 --> 48:59.750
l hope it's not late.
Who am l talking to?

49:00.070 --> 49:01.820
lt's me, it's me.

49:02.950 --> 49:04.860
-What do you want?
-Oh, shit!

49:05.910 --> 49:08.500
l'm sorry to have
disturbed you, madam.

49:08.750 --> 49:11.710
l was looking for Linda. l hope
it's the wrong house. No offense.

49:11.950 --> 49:13.740
My husband has a gun!

49:13.950 --> 49:15.740
l'm sure he has, madam.

49:15.990 --> 49:18.740
For all l know, he shot it
while you screamed.

49:18.950 --> 49:20.670
Perry! Come over here!

49:20.910 --> 49:22.660
This man wants to know
where Linda lives!

49:22.910 --> 49:26.790
She lives at 1 41 33, Apartment A,
next door.

49:27.630 --> 49:30.590
You tell a total stranger that?
You don't know who he is.

49:30.830 --> 49:32.550
-He looks okay.
-Right, get over here!

49:32.870 --> 49:34.940
She's terrible! Does she
always hit you like that?

49:35.190 --> 49:36.420
Yeah, what can l do?

49:36.670 --> 49:38.020
Mind your business!

49:38.270 --> 49:41.780
For God's sake, she's going
to kill you! Get in there!

49:42.030 --> 49:45.540
Give her a shot!
lt's you against her, Perry!

49:46.310 --> 49:47.540
Oh, God!

49:48.470 --> 49:49.740
lt's horrible!

49:49.990 --> 49:51.260
Horrible!

49:53.910 --> 49:55.740
You shouldn't hear this.

50:00.270 --> 50:01.420
God!

50:09.830 --> 50:11.740
Perry, you're a dead man.

50:22.150 --> 50:23.630
Pardon me.

50:23.990 --> 50:25.500
Oh, you're a hedge.

50:29.070 --> 50:31.460
-You must be Linda's father.
-lt's kind of late.

50:31.710 --> 50:34.220
Although l wasn't sleeping myself.

50:34.470 --> 50:36.380
Oh, nice to meet you, Arthur.

50:37.830 --> 50:38.820
Hi, Linda!

50:40.070 --> 50:42.950
Can l come in?
Don't you hate Perry's wife?

50:43.190 --> 50:44.420
Let him in.

50:47.910 --> 50:49.550
Linda, l've missed--

50:51.510 --> 50:53.660
Sorry, Linda.
l'm sorry.

50:53.910 --> 50:55.420
Really.

50:56.710 --> 50:58.300
lt happens.

51:06.190 --> 51:07.700
What's the matter with you?

51:08.870 --> 51:11.430
Nobody knocks on a door
at 3:00 in the morning!

51:11.670 --> 51:14.260
You're so drunk,
you can hardly stand up.

51:14.510 --> 51:16.070
And you're engaged!

51:54.110 --> 51:55.750
This is a goner.

51:58.790 --> 52:00.430
l'm going to sleep.

52:05.190 --> 52:09.540
You come here at 3 o'clock
in the morning to say goodbye?

52:09.750 --> 52:13.630
l have to get up and go to work
in the morning. Stop kidding around!

52:13.870 --> 52:15.740
Will you stop kissing me!

52:17.190 --> 52:19.830
l'm sure you're not going
to want to be a waitress. . .

52:20.070 --> 52:21.140
. . .for the rest of your life.

52:21.390 --> 52:22.870
l am studying to be an actress.

52:23.110 --> 52:25.020
-You told me.
-Well, l am.

52:29.670 --> 52:31.310
This is for you. . .

52:31.550 --> 52:33.820
. . .your father. . .

52:34.190 --> 52:36.220
. . .and your acting career.

52:37.870 --> 52:39.780
Please take it and l'll go.

52:46.470 --> 52:48.380
$1 00,000.

52:53.830 --> 52:55.420
We don't need your money.

52:56.070 --> 52:57.790
Linda, it'll help you.

52:57.990 --> 53:00.020
Look what it's done for you.

53:00.230 --> 53:03.030
Tell your story walking,
before l call a cop!

53:03.230 --> 53:05.020
Get out of here!

53:08.710 --> 53:10.140
Closet.

53:15.510 --> 53:17.020
l know.

53:33.990 --> 53:35.580
Want to take her for a spin, Hobson?

53:36.030 --> 53:37.510
No, thank you, Arthur.

53:38.430 --> 53:41.390
Mr. Bach, be sure you call me
anytime you need the track.

53:41.630 --> 53:43.620
-Take it easy.
-Thank you.

53:49.990 --> 53:51.420
Do you know how miserable l am?

53:51.630 --> 53:55.420
You're miserable?
l've got all this and l'm on a salary.

53:55.670 --> 53:57.390
ARTHUR 3

54:01.390 --> 54:04.300
Do you know the worst part?
The worst part of being me?

54:04.550 --> 54:06.620
l should imagine your breath.

54:07.270 --> 54:09.420
Let me be unhappy, will you?

54:10.310 --> 54:11.900
You know, Hobson. . .

54:12.910 --> 54:15.100
. . .l could love somebody.

54:16.110 --> 54:17.620
l never got to love anybody!

54:18.790 --> 54:23.140
What do l have to live for?
l'm a failure. l'm just in the way.

54:23.470 --> 54:25.460
Would you remove your helmet, please?

54:25.670 --> 54:27.420
-Why?
-Please.

54:31.710 --> 54:32.860
Thank you.

54:33.110 --> 54:34.180
Now your goggles.

54:34.430 --> 54:36.220
-Why?
-Please.

54:41.590 --> 54:43.230
You spoiled little bastard!

54:43.750 --> 54:47.220
You're a man who has everything.
But that's not enough.

54:47.470 --> 54:51.220
You feel unloved? Welcome to
the world. Everyone is unloved!

54:52.270 --> 54:55.700
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.
And incidentally, l love you.

54:56.430 --> 54:58.660
Marry Susan, Arthur.

54:59.470 --> 55:02.620
Poor drunks do not find love.

55:03.270 --> 55:06.860
Poor drunks have very few teeth.
They urinate outdoors.

55:07.110 --> 55:09.180
They freeze to death in summer.

55:09.510 --> 55:11.260
l can't bear to think
of you that way.

55:11.510 --> 55:13.150
l need Linda, Hobson.

55:13.390 --> 55:14.500
l see.

55:15.110 --> 55:17.860
Well, perhaps fate
will lend a hand, Arthur.

55:18.510 --> 55:20.070
One never knows.

55:22.470 --> 55:23.740
Good afternoon?

55:24.270 --> 55:25.830
May l come in?

55:26.510 --> 55:29.820
lf you and your undershirt
would walk two paces backwards. . .

55:30.150 --> 55:31.740
. . .l could enter this dwelling.

55:51.630 --> 55:53.380
How revolting.

55:57.830 --> 56:00.820
Look who's here.
The British Tonto.

56:01.510 --> 56:03.260
How are you? How's Arthur?

56:03.670 --> 56:05.940
Ever since l met Arthur,
l liked him.

56:06.190 --> 56:09.500
We have to make sure these
two wonderful kids stay together.

56:09.710 --> 56:10.780
Who is this person?

56:12.150 --> 56:14.950
-He's my father.
-Yes, and l'd like to say that--

56:15.150 --> 56:16.420
Try not to speak.

56:16.630 --> 56:19.510
Would you get me a cup of tea?
l wish to speak to Linda.

56:20.070 --> 56:21.420
Sure.

56:23.710 --> 56:26.140
There is an engagement
party tonight. . .

56:26.390 --> 56:29.220
. . .at Arthur's father's house
in Southampton.

56:29.670 --> 56:32.630
Here is the address.
Perhaps you should attend.

56:33.030 --> 56:34.750
Are all the ones
he passed up coming?

56:34.950 --> 56:37.060
Young woman, this is a tie
you cannot steal!

56:37.310 --> 56:39.380
This is a tie you'll have
to work for.

56:39.630 --> 56:42.900
Are you inviting me
to Arthur's engagement party?

56:43.110 --> 56:45.220
This is not an invitation.

56:45.510 --> 56:46.830
However. . .

56:47.230 --> 56:50.500
. . .if there's one thing that
old gentlemen can still do. . .

56:50.750 --> 56:53.900
. . .they can still spot
young gentlemen in love.

56:55.070 --> 56:57.020
Please go to the party.

56:57.670 --> 56:58.820
Are you all right?

56:59.030 --> 57:00.860
Yes, l'm fine.

57:08.150 --> 57:09.660
Does Arthur know you're here?

57:09.910 --> 57:12.980
No, Arthur is far too fine
a person to be involved. . .

57:13.230 --> 57:15.380
. . .in something as devious as this.

57:16.110 --> 57:18.420
You really look out for him,
don't you?

57:18.870 --> 57:22.300
And it is a job
that l recommend highly.

57:23.750 --> 57:24.900
l have something for you.

57:25.110 --> 57:25.940
For me?

57:33.190 --> 57:34.340
What is it?

57:34.590 --> 57:37.230
lf l told you,
it would spoil the surprise.

57:37.430 --> 57:38.940
Don't open it.

57:40.070 --> 57:41.060
Here's your tea.

57:41.310 --> 57:43.220
l despise tea.

57:43.430 --> 57:45.620
Would you bring me 2 aspirin
from the bathroom?

57:45.870 --> 57:50.380
You'll find them on the top shelf,
behind the untouched shaving cream.

58:02.350 --> 58:04.340
That sounds bad.
Have you seen a doctor?

58:05.270 --> 58:07.020
Yes.

58:07.230 --> 58:09.020
And he has seen me.

58:13.470 --> 58:14.950
You know. . .

58:17.310 --> 58:19.460
. . .l think Arthur has
a very good friend.

58:22.190 --> 58:23.620
May l kiss you on the cheek?

58:23.910 --> 58:25.820
ls it something you feel
strongly about?

58:34.870 --> 58:36.380
What about your aspirins?

58:37.030 --> 58:39.420
The aspirins are for you, my dear.

59:59.550 --> 01:00:00.500
Hello.

01:00:02.310 --> 01:00:03.580
Good evening.

01:00:12.390 --> 01:00:14.500
God knows when l'll see you again.

01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:17.460
Arthur, will you play
something for us?

01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:44.350
-Don't you hate these things?
-Despise them.

01:00:44.550 --> 01:00:46.460
Actually, seriously. . .

01:00:47.470 --> 01:00:49.780
. . .songs come and go.

01:00:50.070 --> 01:00:52.420
But l love the classics.

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.780
And l hope you'll enjoy this one.

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:08.380
You'd better watch out

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:11.420
You'd better not cry

01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:14.100
Are you good friends with Arthur?

01:01:14.430 --> 01:01:15.910
For ages.

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:20.060
l'm so pleased he finally found
the right woman. Where is she?

01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:21.740
Over there.

01:01:21.950 --> 01:01:23.860
lsn't she just beautiful?

01:01:24.110 --> 01:01:25.060
Of course she is.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:27.540
Why would Arthur marry a dog?

01:01:27.750 --> 01:01:28.620
Pardon?

01:01:28.830 --> 01:01:31.140
Santa Claus is coming to town

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:37.820
How does it feel to be
getting married?

01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:40.270
Blue Moon

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:43.460
You saw me standing alone

01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:47.220
Without a dream in my heart

01:01:49.830 --> 01:01:52.180
Thanks a lot. That's flattering.

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.220
lf you knew Susan
Like l knew Susan

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:59.150
l need a drink!

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:07.660
-Tell me your entire name, darling.
-Preston Langly.

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:12.180
Really! lf you don't remember
when we met, l mean, honestly!

01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:14.740
-Put your arm around me.
-Of course.

01:02:17.510 --> 01:02:19.100
Linda, you're here.

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:21.620
So true.

01:02:23.550 --> 01:02:24.740
Join us.

01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:30.060
Congratulations.
Father sends his regards.

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:32.420
-Does he?
-Yes, he does.

01:02:32.870 --> 01:02:35.140
Wednesday night may be
difficult for me.

01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:38.060
-What?
-You're looking wonderful, my dear.

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:40.180
-Aren't l? Thank you.
-Wednesday?

01:02:40.430 --> 01:02:42.740
lt's difficult for her
that night, Preston.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:46.380
lsn't that the night you usually
attend the ballet, darling?

01:02:46.630 --> 01:02:50.260
Actually, l feel foolish,
but l don't recall ever making--

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:53.980
Would you be divine and
get me a gin and tonic?

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.660
Scotch for me, Preston.

01:02:57.870 --> 01:03:01.060
-You wait here for me?
-lf it takes forever.

01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:12.380
What are you doing here. . .

01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:14.940
. . .and why are you talking like that?

01:03:17.990 --> 01:03:19.710
l was in the neighborhood.

01:03:19.950 --> 01:03:22.540
lt took me two buses,
three cabs and a train. . .

01:03:22.790 --> 01:03:25.510
. . .to get into the neighborhood.
But what the hell?

01:03:26.190 --> 01:03:29.070
Nice place. l like a living room
you can land a plane in.

01:03:29.310 --> 01:03:31.870
There's more of it. You like a tour?

01:03:32.590 --> 01:03:34.460
l've seen bedrooms.

01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:36.700
Don't be a lover. Be a person.

01:03:37.950 --> 01:03:39.620
Make me happy.

01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:42.500
Her name is Linda Marolla.

01:03:42.870 --> 01:03:46.750
She's the one Arthur saw
the other night. She lives in Queens.

01:04:03.270 --> 01:04:04.260
Mario, please!

01:04:04.470 --> 01:04:08.460
Don't worry. l talked to the warden.
We'll get you out of here.

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:12.990
When l was a kid, l used to open
their stalls and let them run out.

01:04:13.230 --> 01:04:15.660
You should have been there
the day l freed my goldfish.

01:04:15.910 --> 01:04:18.100
Come over here.
l want you two to meet.

01:04:18.350 --> 01:04:21.420
Pancho, this is Linda.
l told you about her, remember?

01:04:23.790 --> 01:04:26.260
lt must have been something,
growing up with all this.

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:28.540
l was away at boarding school
most of the time.

01:04:28.870 --> 01:04:32.750
l was kicked out of ten prep schools.
l was a bad kid.

01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:34.470
No, you weren't.

01:04:34.830 --> 01:04:36.660
You just wanted to go home.

01:04:37.550 --> 01:04:39.700
Bad kids don't grow up
as nice as you.

01:04:39.950 --> 01:04:42.460
-Why do you think Pancho loves you?
-Thank you.

01:04:45.190 --> 01:04:47.460
This is kind of like prom night,
isn't it?

01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:50.660
l mean, we're all dressed up.

01:04:54.950 --> 01:04:56.270
Have you ever been in love?

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:00.020
You?

01:05:02.710 --> 01:05:05.860
But when l was little,
l thought the moon followed me.

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:06.900
What?

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:13.190
l would walk and l thought
the moon went anyplace l did.

01:05:14.790 --> 01:05:16.220
That's great!

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:19.380
l know it's silly,
but l was only eight years old.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.860
l thought it meant something special
would happen to me someday.

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:27.980
So l've been waiting. Every day l've
been doing my hair, and washing. . .

01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:30.780
-. . .my face--
-Can l kiss you?

01:05:31.310 --> 01:05:32.630
Please.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:43.900
l wasn't talking to you.

01:05:46.070 --> 01:05:49.860
Why is it you can make me laugh
at the saddest times in my life?

01:05:50.110 --> 01:05:51.700
l'm funny, that's why.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.020
l'm funny!

01:05:53.990 --> 01:05:55.100
Yeah, that's it.

01:05:56.070 --> 01:05:57.630
You're going to marry Susan.

01:05:59.670 --> 01:06:03.260
l'm still glad l came here.
Made a fool out of myself.

01:06:03.990 --> 01:06:05.420
l wish we had made love.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:09.740
l'd give anything
to see you in the morning.

01:06:11.070 --> 01:06:14.740
l have to marry Susan.
lf l don't, my family will cut me off.

01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:17.020
lt's almost a billion dollars.

01:06:19.230 --> 01:06:21.220
One of the horses just fainted.

01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:24.780
Look, this is ridiculous.

01:06:25.030 --> 01:06:28.660
You got cab fare to the city?
l don't like the train at night.

01:06:30.150 --> 01:06:31.980
Look, when Susan and l
get married. . .

01:06:32.230 --> 01:06:34.870
. . .l can set you up in an apartment
and we can--

01:06:35.110 --> 01:06:36.260
Forget it.

01:06:38.310 --> 01:06:39.340
Are you cute!

01:06:44.590 --> 01:06:46.700
l thought l'd find you here.

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:49.580
He just loves that smelly old horse.

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:50.660
Have we met?

01:06:52.190 --> 01:06:53.860
l don't think you have.

01:06:54.070 --> 01:06:56.870
Linda Marolla,
this is Susan Johnson, my fiancée.

01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:59.340
l hope l'm not interrupting.

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:01.860
l'd say that if l were you.

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:04.860
We might as well tell her.

01:07:06.150 --> 01:07:07.630
You tell her.

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:14.950
My husband, Harold,
went to prep school with Arthur.

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:18.500
Harold lost a fortune gambling.
He's sick!

01:07:18.790 --> 01:07:19.860
He's a sick man!

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:22.460
But he's my husband.

01:07:23.270 --> 01:07:26.070
l'm not one of your guests.
l came for one reason.

01:07:26.310 --> 01:07:29.460
l came here to beg Arthur
to lend us some money.

01:07:30.750 --> 01:07:32.100
One of my kids. . .

01:07:32.350 --> 01:07:34.460
. . .my youngest, my baby. . .

01:07:34.750 --> 01:07:36.540
. . .needs an operation.

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:40.110
Harold hasn't kept up the insurance.
l don't know where to turn!

01:07:40.350 --> 01:07:41.860
Do l have to go on?

01:07:42.110 --> 01:07:43.180
No, of course not!

01:07:43.430 --> 01:07:45.300
Of course not!

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:48.380
-Arthur, l wasn't spying on you.
-l know that!

01:07:48.630 --> 01:07:51.660
There's an urgent phone call
for you from Bitterman.

01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:53.020
Thank you.

01:07:55.470 --> 01:07:57.460
Say hello to Harold for me.

01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:10.460
You all right, Bitterman?

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:11.860
Yes, sir.

01:08:14.670 --> 01:08:17.060
Would you like me to get you
some Scotch, sir?

01:08:17.910 --> 01:08:19.700
We'll get through this together.

01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:26.460
lt's very hard.

01:08:30.029 --> 01:08:32.060
l'm glad to have you here, sir.

01:08:34.149 --> 01:08:36.870
Bitterman, do me a favor.

01:08:37.390 --> 01:08:38.950
Go back to the house.

01:08:39.310 --> 01:08:43.350
Phone my father and Mr. Johnson and
Miss Susan. Tell them what's happened.

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:47.260
The wedding will have to wait.
And bring me back some clothes here.

01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:59.500
Okay, let's open the presents.

01:09:00.550 --> 01:09:01.740
l'm sorry, Arthur.

01:09:02.670 --> 01:09:05.180
-For what?
-For leaving you.

01:09:07.270 --> 01:09:08.670
You're not leaving anyone.

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.380
Why, it's a basketball!

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:19.859
What the hell?
l knew you didn't have one.

01:09:20.470 --> 01:09:22.899
lf l feel the urge to dribble. . .

01:09:23.149 --> 01:09:24.939
. . .l can always call the nurse.

01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:27.870
l'll put this over here.

01:09:33.149 --> 01:09:35.740
You purchased a choo-choo?

01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:37.859
Look, the wheels go round.

01:09:44.710 --> 01:09:46.380
l'm very pleased.

01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:48.060
Do you remember. . .

01:09:48.270 --> 01:09:51.819
. . .when you used to play
hide-and-seek with me?

01:09:52.069 --> 01:09:54.020
l used to hide and
you never found me!

01:09:54.670 --> 01:09:57.390
-Did you know l never looked?
-Come on!

01:09:57.870 --> 01:10:00.590
Well, l looked a little.

01:10:02.830 --> 01:10:04.660
One for you, one for me.
Put it on.

01:10:06.150 --> 01:10:08.060
l don't wish to put it on.

01:10:13.390 --> 01:10:14.950
l'll put it on.

01:10:19.630 --> 01:10:23.460
lf l begin to die,
please take this off my head.

01:10:23.750 --> 01:10:25.860
This isn't how
l wish to be remembered.

01:10:28.590 --> 01:10:29.860
Aren't they great?

01:10:33.190 --> 01:10:35.620
l've got guns and
holsters too. Look.

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:40.870
Just in town for supplies, partner.

01:10:43.670 --> 01:10:45.020
Arthur, l'm frightened.

01:10:49.950 --> 01:10:51.860
l know you're frightened.

01:10:52.510 --> 01:10:54.460
l'm going to take care of you.

01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:27.500
Good morning, Mr. Bach.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:28.860
Hi, Ken.

01:11:35.230 --> 01:11:36.950
Here, l'll take that.

01:11:37.190 --> 01:11:40.460
You look terrible.
You haven't slept in a week.

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.100
Well, we had a bad night.
He was up.

01:11:43.310 --> 01:11:45.980
l got the kippers and eggs.
l'll get fired.

01:11:46.230 --> 01:11:48.420
No, you won't.

01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:50.020
Listen.

01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:51.900
For lunch. . .

01:11:53.830 --> 01:11:57.660
. . .l want the trout almondine
from Lutêce. Tell Henri it's for me.

01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:59.060
He shouldn't eat that.

01:11:59.270 --> 01:12:02.100
l don't want his last meal
to be Jell-O.

01:12:02.350 --> 01:12:04.460
Thanks very much. See you later.

01:12:07.110 --> 01:12:08.540
Look who's up.

01:12:12.550 --> 01:12:14.660
We have eggs, we have kippers.

01:12:14.910 --> 01:12:17.500
We have croissants.
We have a yellow rose.

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:21.340
We have strawberries.
We have blueberry cakes.

01:12:21.590 --> 01:12:24.230
We have orange juice
and great coffee.

01:12:25.190 --> 01:12:27.100
Right. Table for one, sir.

01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:29.020
Your regular.

01:12:31.190 --> 01:12:32.620
You know, Arthur. . .

01:12:33.870 --> 01:12:35.460
. . .l'm very glad you're here.

01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:38.580
l want you to eat this.
This is costing me.

01:12:38.830 --> 01:12:42.220
l've got chefs working at six
in the morning all over town.

01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:44.220
You look awful.

01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:47.860
That's because you've never
seen me sober. Now eat.

01:12:48.070 --> 01:12:50.300
Come on. You used to make me eat.

01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:58.150
lt's not so bad.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:01.260
You don't need to be
so frightened about it.

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:05.340
-What?
-Dying.

01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:08.220
Seems natural.

01:13:08.870 --> 01:13:10.620
Even comforting, now.

01:13:12.390 --> 01:13:14.060
You're even teaching me
how to die?

01:13:14.670 --> 01:13:17.660
l'm through teaching you anything.

01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:20.420
You've grown up.

01:13:30.630 --> 01:13:34.060
You can do anything
with your life that you want to.

01:13:35.590 --> 01:13:36.860
What do you mean?

01:13:38.350 --> 01:13:39.860
Figure it out.

01:13:40.550 --> 01:13:42.540
You seen Linda Marolla lately?

01:13:43.310 --> 01:13:44.820
Linda Marolla?

01:13:45.590 --> 01:13:47.230
Why would you ask about her?

01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:50.820
l don't know what l'm talking about.
l'm dying.

01:13:58.390 --> 01:14:00.110
Want me to read you Shakespeare?

01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:03.070
Hamlet was in big trouble
when we left off.

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:04.380
No.

01:14:19.470 --> 01:14:21.190
You're a good son.

01:15:11.910 --> 01:15:14.790
You take your average kid today.

01:15:15.270 --> 01:15:17.300
He don't want to go in the army.

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:19.860
Yeah, what does he care? Dope!

01:15:20.070 --> 01:15:23.740
But the Communists,
they go in the army!

01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:26.940
lf only we had some Communists here.

01:15:27.510 --> 01:15:28.740
No.

01:15:30.150 --> 01:15:32.580
While our kids are dancing. . .

01:15:32.950 --> 01:15:35.670
. . .their kids are learning
how to fight!

01:15:35.910 --> 01:15:38.060
Everybody's dancing here!

01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:41.460
You're right. You're right.
lt's not worth talking about.

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.470
-Let me buy you another drink.
-Right.

01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:46.180
What do you do?

01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:48.580
l'm a dance instructor.

01:15:51.270 --> 01:15:54.070
No, l'm kidding. l'm kidding!
Honest to God.

01:15:54.310 --> 01:15:55.260
l'm a dentist.

01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:57.540
l hate dentists.

01:15:58.150 --> 01:16:01.820
We're not bad guys.
lt's not easy, you know.

01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:05.220
There's teeth and gums and blood!

01:16:05.470 --> 01:16:07.060
Oh, my God!

01:16:07.470 --> 01:16:10.110
l have to get looped
just to walk into my office.

01:16:10.350 --> 01:16:13.860
Bartender!
We would like two more, please.

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:17.070
-Haven't you had enough?
-l want more than enough.

01:16:18.870 --> 01:16:22.380
How come you got all this
money for all these drinks?

01:16:22.710 --> 01:16:26.910
l saved my money.
l haven't had a drink in a month.

01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:28.700
Oh, my God!

01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:31.100
Well, you see, my father died.

01:16:33.630 --> 01:16:35.420
So l stayed sober.

01:16:37.310 --> 01:16:39.140
One night at the hospital. . .

01:16:39.390 --> 01:16:42.060
. . .he fell asleep.
l was watching him.

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:44.260
And then. . .

01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:47.580
. . .he just kept on sleeping.

01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.700
And l was all alone.

01:16:50.910 --> 01:16:52.820
Oh, that's terrible.

01:16:53.710 --> 01:16:55.140
Listen. . .

01:16:55.630 --> 01:16:58.060
. . .l was lucky to know him at all.

01:16:59.350 --> 01:17:00.910
Are you somebody's father?

01:17:01.150 --> 01:17:03.100
No, l'm a drunk.

01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:07.420
l have a brother
who moved to New Jersey.

01:17:08.350 --> 01:17:10.070
l'm getting married soon.

01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:11.460
Great!

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:13.390
l don't love her.

01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:15.380
l don't love her!

01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:17.110
Well, don't make a scene!

01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:19.580
No, l'm sorry, but there's. . .

01:17:19.830 --> 01:17:21.180
. . .this other girl.

01:17:22.150 --> 01:17:23.710
She steals ties. . .

01:17:25.470 --> 01:17:28.030
. . .and gives them to her father.
She's funny.

01:17:30.350 --> 01:17:31.620
l want her.

01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:34.500
l want her!

01:17:34.710 --> 01:17:35.940
l have to go.

01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:40.100
Sorry.

01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:43.350
Sir, your wedding is within
less than five hours.

01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:44.860
Listen.

01:17:45.110 --> 01:17:47.060
Go see your brother.

01:17:47.310 --> 01:17:48.180
All right?

01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:51.270
Nobody should be alone.

01:17:51.510 --> 01:17:53.300
lt's awful. . .

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:55.430
. . .to be alone.

01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:05.310
l want you to know, if he doesn't
show up for this wedding. . .

01:18:05.550 --> 01:18:06.460
. . .l'll kill him.

01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:10.590
Don't worry about it, Burt.
l talk to Arthur every day.

01:18:10.830 --> 01:18:13.710
Since Hobson's death, he's stopped
drinking. He's anxious to work.

01:18:14.030 --> 01:18:17.780
He's become a responsible citizen.
He'll be a good husband.

01:18:18.350 --> 01:18:20.460
Thanks very much.
Have a nice day.

01:18:21.710 --> 01:18:24.670
-Where's my roll?
-We're having it monogrammed.

01:18:24.870 --> 01:18:26.820
Hurry up with the old man's roll!

01:18:29.430 --> 01:18:30.300
Can l help you?

01:18:30.550 --> 01:18:32.860
Do you recommend the French toast?

01:18:33.110 --> 01:18:34.510
With all of my heart.

01:18:36.270 --> 01:18:37.750
Lady, l got customers.

01:18:38.230 --> 01:18:39.420
l'll have it.

01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:41.700
You've made the right decision.

01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:43.260
Wait a minute! Wait!

01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:44.940
l've waited long enough.

01:18:46.750 --> 01:18:49.550
Can you take the next
60 years off?

01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:51.780
l'll have to ask.

01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:57.830
-You want some coffee?
-Where's my roll?

01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:59.260
Wait! l'll get it!

01:18:59.510 --> 01:19:02.340
-What the hell's going on?
-She's getting your roll.

01:19:04.270 --> 01:19:05.460
Here's your roll.

01:19:05.710 --> 01:19:06.620
Arthur, what happened?

01:19:06.870 --> 01:19:08.100
Hobson died.

01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:09.380
l know.

01:19:09.630 --> 01:19:12.300
He loved you very much.
Did you know that?

01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:14.900
And l think l'll grow up.

01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:16.340
l want to marry you.

01:19:18.030 --> 01:19:21.140
Although l'm supposed
to marry Susan in 20 minutes.

01:19:21.390 --> 01:19:24.460
-He's drunk, but he sounds sincere.
-Eat your roll!

01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:28.460
The money.
Can you live without the money?

01:19:28.910 --> 01:19:30.500
Well, we'll have to.

01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:34.820
Please marry me.

01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:39.260
l'll try to be sober
and to make you happy.

01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:42.180
Although it won't be easy,
because l'll be poor.

01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:43.300
We'll be poor.

01:19:43.510 --> 01:19:44.580
We'll be poor.

01:19:45.030 --> 01:19:47.500
-Most people are poor.
-Eat your roll!

01:19:47.750 --> 01:19:51.140
Now, l have to tell Susan.
Come with me?

01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:52.380
l got to change.

01:19:52.630 --> 01:19:54.350
-l'll cover for you.
-All right.

01:19:56.150 --> 01:19:58.660
Last night, l could have sworn
the moon was following me.

01:19:58.870 --> 01:20:00.300
lt was.

01:20:27.350 --> 01:20:29.260
l'm Arthur Bach, the groom.

01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:30.950
Congratulations!

01:20:31.190 --> 01:20:33.300
Thank you. And to you too.

01:20:33.550 --> 01:20:36.620
l wonder, could you tell me
where the wedding party is?

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:38.820
Right over there, in that room.

01:20:39.350 --> 01:20:42.820
Thank you very much.
You've got a lovely. . .

01:20:47.190 --> 01:20:50.020
. . .hat! Hat. lt's called a hat.

01:20:54.790 --> 01:20:55.980
Good luck, Arthur.

01:20:56.990 --> 01:21:00.260
Thank you very much.
l'm Arthur Bach, the groom.

01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:02.660
l'm Arthur Bach.

01:21:11.990 --> 01:21:13.820
Did you forget your garter belt?

01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:20.910
Sorry l'm late.

01:21:24.430 --> 01:21:27.260
Susan, just the one l wanted
to talk to.

01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:28.060
Nice dress.

01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:31.620
-Arthur, the ceremony's just--
-Yeah, l know.

01:21:33.110 --> 01:21:37.020
Could we just talk for a moment,
away from all these people?

01:21:38.310 --> 01:21:39.380
Of course.

01:21:52.910 --> 01:21:55.020
l don't love you. l don't love you.

01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:57.420
-What is it, dear?
-l don't love you.

01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:59.220
l don't love you!

01:21:59.630 --> 01:22:01.420
lt's right in that room over there.

01:22:01.710 --> 01:22:03.620
Thank you.
Your hat is lovely.

01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:05.540
l've heard.

01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:09.220
You're drunk?

01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:11.580
You're frightened?

01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:13.470
l'm both of those.

01:22:13.710 --> 01:22:15.900
l know, but l'm. . .

01:22:16.150 --> 01:22:17.870
. . .in love with another woman.

01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:21.620
-What, dear?
-l'm in love with another woman.

01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:24.860
l'm in love. . .

01:22:25.870 --> 01:22:27.940
. . .with another. . .

01:22:28.190 --> 01:22:29.180
. . .woman!

01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:31.780
Susan, the one innocent. . .

01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:35.220
. . .person in all of this has been you.
l'm really sorry.

01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:37.260
Shut up, Arthur! Just shut up!

01:22:39.190 --> 01:22:40.750
Daddy!

01:22:45.430 --> 01:22:47.340
Hello, Mr. Johnson!

01:22:59.470 --> 01:23:01.190
He must be nervous.

01:23:01.430 --> 01:23:03.020
Arthur gets nervous.

01:23:05.110 --> 01:23:07.460
Here's your ring, Arthur.

01:23:08.710 --> 01:23:10.060
l hope you're happy.

01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:13.620
Now, stand up, son, l want
to kill you with my bare hands.

01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:19.660
l think you know everyone.
This is Susan's father.

01:23:20.150 --> 01:23:21.580
My God! Arthur, you're really hurt!

01:23:23.630 --> 01:23:26.540
l've got him right
where l want him.

01:23:31.470 --> 01:23:33.260
You animal!

01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:34.910
Look, it's over!

01:23:35.230 --> 01:23:38.340
He doesn't love your daughter.
l'm sorry. lt happens.

01:23:38.670 --> 01:23:39.700
He loves me.

01:23:39.910 --> 01:23:41.550
What about Harold?

01:23:42.670 --> 01:23:44.310
Harold?

01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:46.270
-You poor thing.
-Stand aside.

01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:50.340
Now, is this the slut that
you've disgraced my daughter for?!

01:23:50.590 --> 01:23:51.380
Slut?!

01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:54.180
Slut?!

01:24:15.510 --> 01:24:16.380
Please, Daddy!

01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:19.220
-Daddy, he's not worth it.
-Just sit up.

01:24:19.470 --> 01:24:21.060
Can you move, Arthur?

01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:22.660
Everybody out!

01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:25.270
Out! All of you, out!

01:24:28.310 --> 01:24:29.660
God!

01:24:35.190 --> 01:24:38.020
He's taking the knife
out of the cheese!

01:24:39.390 --> 01:24:40.900
Do you think he wants
some cheese?

01:24:41.110 --> 01:24:43.180
No, l think we're going to die!

01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:51.870
What's going on here?

01:24:52.070 --> 01:24:54.020
Stop that this instant!

01:24:55.510 --> 01:24:58.260
Don't screw with me, Burt!

01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:40.140
Ladies and gentlemen. . .

01:25:42.830 --> 01:25:43.980
. . .l'm sorry.

01:25:46.110 --> 01:25:49.660
As you probably have surmised by now. . .

01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:51.740
. . .there will be no wedding.

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:54.950
The bride. . .

01:25:55.190 --> 01:25:56.910
. . .has had second thoughts. . .

01:25:57.590 --> 01:25:59.340
. . .and has decided. . .

01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:01.020
. . .not to marry me.

01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:04.420
Most of you know me.
Can you blame her?

01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:11.940
l won't be seeing most of you
anymore because. . .

01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:16.420
. . .l'm going to be. . .

01:26:17.710 --> 01:26:18.820
. . .poor.

01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:24.430
l'll miss you.

01:26:29.590 --> 01:26:32.100
Now there's a good. . .

01:26:32.350 --> 01:26:34.180
. . .chance l should go. . .

01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:36.910
. . .to the hospital.

01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:49.260
This has some iodine on it,
so it might hurt a little.

01:26:49.510 --> 01:26:51.620
That hurts, l hate it! Stop it!

01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:56.140
-Why did you do that?
-Because l hate an infection!

01:26:56.910 --> 01:26:59.020
lf you'd have just
let me get--

01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:08.420
Look, as long as we're here. . . .

01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.700
Do you promise to love me. . .

01:27:10.950 --> 01:27:12.220
. . .and obey me?

01:27:12.630 --> 01:27:13.860
And be a good boy?

01:27:15.790 --> 01:27:16.620
l do.

01:27:17.310 --> 01:27:21.100
And do you promise never to put
that stuff on my face again?

01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:22.340
l do.

01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:24.780
God!

01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.220
We're going to be great!

01:27:28.150 --> 01:27:30.180
We're going to be like. . .

01:27:30.390 --> 01:27:34.620
. . .one of those poor couples
on the subway who hold hands.

01:27:35.230 --> 01:27:37.220
How much is the subway?

01:27:37.710 --> 01:27:40.740
Sixty cents. But if you spit,
it's a $500 fine.

01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:43.140
Then l won't spit.

01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:45.180
Good! None of the best people do.

01:27:45.430 --> 01:27:46.700
l'll get a job!

01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:49.620
That's what l'll do!

01:27:49.870 --> 01:27:51.590
l'll get a job!

01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:53.460
l'll work!

01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:55.630
God, this'll be great!

01:27:55.870 --> 01:27:58.460
-Good! Look how excited he is.
-l'll come home from work.

01:27:58.990 --> 01:28:00.580
You'll be ironing.

01:28:00.830 --> 01:28:03.100
We'll eat some cheap,
disgusting food.

01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:04.220
Stop!

01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:06.470
l think we're in trouble.

01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:08.900
That is out of the question!

01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:13.540
There has never been such a thing
as a working-class Bach!

01:28:14.390 --> 01:28:16.460
And there never will be!

01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:21.420
Step! Step!

01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:24.700
l've reached a decision.

01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:29.820
The Bach family must endure.
And not on a subway.

01:28:30.270 --> 01:28:33.020
Your children will be
senators, ambassadors.

01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:35.620
Perhaps even a president!

01:28:36.670 --> 01:28:40.220
You have your 750 million dollars.

01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:42.220
All right!

01:28:46.110 --> 01:28:47.860
l don't know, Martha.

01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:50.180
You don't know?!

01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:53.310
-Money has screwed me up my whole life.
-l know!

01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:56.060
l've always been rich
and never been happy.

01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:58.460
l've always been poor
and usually been happy.

01:28:58.710 --> 01:29:02.420
Rubbish! l've always been rich
and l've always been happy.

01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:07.430
Would you make me
a tuna fish sandwich?

01:29:08.750 --> 01:29:11.420
l'm going to have
a tuna fish sandwich, Martha.

01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:12.820
Step.

01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:20.230
l demand that you take this money.

01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:23.820
l want a decision
and l want it now!

01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:29.020
l can't tell you what a lousy
wedding that was, Bitterman.

01:29:31.470 --> 01:29:33.380
Bitterman, goodbye.

01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:35.460
l'm going.

01:29:36.110 --> 01:29:37.540
Goodbye, sir.

01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:39.980
lt was a pleasure working for you.

01:29:40.230 --> 01:29:42.740
Chauffeurs rarely get to laugh.
Thank you.

01:29:42.990 --> 01:29:44.980
-Goodbye, Bitterman.
-Goodbye, miss.

01:29:45.190 --> 01:29:48.580
Arthur, l'm going!
Open that door, Rockland!

01:29:49.870 --> 01:29:52.860
-Ever been on a yacht?
-No, is it wonderful?

01:29:53.110 --> 01:29:55.020
lt doesn't suck.
