Standing by with the gauze.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.640
How much longer?

12:57.680 --> 12:58.920
Almost done.

13:02.040 --> 13:03.240
Ruby?

13:04.840 --> 13:06.840
No, no, no,
keep your eyes on me.

13:06.880 --> 13:08.880
- You OK?
- Is it happening?

13:11.760 --> 13:13.360
Just keep your eyes on me.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.320
Don't think about anything else.
Keep looking at me.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.440
Right here.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.320
Done. Right, let's get him
out of here.

13:24.520 --> 13:26.120
Stretcher, please!

13:26.160 --> 13:28.160
- Ruby?
- What?

13:28.200 --> 13:29.960
Thank you.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.320
[Waves crashing]

13:41.360 --> 13:44.720
- Get your gob round that.
- No, ta.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.520
- Go on, you might like it.
- I've reached the stage in life

13:47.560 --> 13:49.480
when you don't have
to try anything new.

13:49.520 --> 13:52.320
- It's tremendously comforting.
- Suit yourself.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.400
Gorgeous.

13:56.440 --> 13:58.520
- Fancy a game of poker?
- Shut your face.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.640
I'm meeting up with a couple of
mates of mine, air stewardesses.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.400
They're in town on an overnight,
you should come along.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.360
- Nah, you're all right.
- What else you got planned?

14:07.400 --> 14:10.760
No, it's not that, it's just...
I'd feel a bit...you know.

14:10.800 --> 14:12.680
Two blokes,
two women out together.

14:12.720 --> 14:15.800
Don't be daft. It's not like
that, they're just mates.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.160
- Even so.
- Paul, it's the 21st century.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.680
Not in here, it isn't.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.120
Don't you want to do something

14:22.160 --> 14:24.200
instead of sitting
round here every night?

14:24.240 --> 14:25.760
I don't come here every night.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.640
Bev and Jackie
are a real top laugh.

14:27.680 --> 14:29.000
You should come along.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.240
- If I say yes will you shut up?
- Yes.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.200
I'll think about it.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.480
I'll take that as a yes.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.640
[Breathes heavily]

14:57.680 --> 15:00.360
No sign of pelvic injury
and the chest looks OK.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.960
How's the ultrasound?

15:03.000 --> 15:05.240
There's a small amount of
free fluid in his abdomen.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.680
His BP and pulse are improving,
so let's just keep an eye on it.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.640
RUBY: He was so brave.

15:11.680 --> 15:15.080
People never cease to amaze me
both for good and for bad.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.120
- Why not go for a cup of tea?
- I'm OK.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.760
Anyone would need a break.
It's been a hell of a morning.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.160
You don't.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.120
Surely you've realised by now
that I am invincible.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.280
Thank you.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.000
Hello.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.200
Hello.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.800
Who builds these places?

16:24.840 --> 16:28.920
It could be dodgy builders,
or it could just be bad luck.

16:28.960 --> 16:31.880
It's best to not think about
how these things happen.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.280
I just try to focus on
what's in front of me and...

16:38.520 --> 16:40.200
..do the best job I can.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.200
The man this morning
with the amputation.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.560
Will he live?

16:47.200 --> 16:49.120
I don't know.

16:50.680 --> 16:51.920
Hopefully.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.280
How we doing?

16:55.320 --> 16:57.400
We'll take a look at that arm
in a minute.

16:57.440 --> 17:00.240
See what we can do to set
things up for a skin graft.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.880
- [Monitor bleeps]
- What's up with his pressure?

17:02.920 --> 17:04.680
It's down. 90 over 60.

17:06.520 --> 17:10.760
Mohanan, try to stay calm,
we're doing everything we can.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.200
It's an ABO reaction
to the blood transfusion.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.520
- Do we know his type yet?
- I'll chase it.

17:15.560 --> 17:18.079
- [Laboured breathing]
- Mohanan?

17:18.119 --> 17:19.599
It's OK. I'm here.

17:19.640 --> 17:23.119
- We definitely gave him O neg.
- Could it be wrongly labelled?

17:23.160 --> 17:25.200
It's possible
but highly unlikely.

17:25.240 --> 17:27.160
Nurse, could you run through
some saline

17:27.200 --> 17:29.920
and draw up adrenalin
and hydrocortisone stat.

17:29.960 --> 17:32.080
- How's his pressure now?
- Still low.

17:32.120 --> 17:34.120
The blood results are back.
He's HH.

17:34.960 --> 17:36.240
Well, that explains it.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.280
Bombay blood group.
As rare as they come.

17:38.320 --> 17:40.320
- How long till we can get some?
- Way too long.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.920
It'll have to come from Mumbai.

17:41.960 --> 17:45.480
- He did mention a brother.
- Right, get on to it, will you?

17:47.080 --> 17:48.800
[Horn beeps]

17:56.280 --> 17:59.920
Shyam, I told you to leave
ten minutes ago.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.440
Huh? You don't know where
the Princess Street is?

18:02.480 --> 18:04.440
OK, I'll go.

18:04.480 --> 18:06.400
[Motorcycle approaches]

18:09.720 --> 18:11.720
Mr Kalita? Ratheesh Kalita?

18:11.760 --> 18:14.280
I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry,
can you wait for ten minutes?

18:14.320 --> 18:15.560
It's about your brother.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.240
Who are you?

18:18.280 --> 18:20.600
I'm Dr Walker. I work at
the Good Karma Hospital.

18:20.640 --> 18:24.720
Mohanan is one of my patients.
He needs a blood match urgently.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.560
Did he tell you to come here?

18:26.600 --> 18:29.400
Yes, he's been in
a very serious accident.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.640
I'm sorry, I have to go.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.760
Mr Kalita, he's very ill.

18:33.800 --> 18:36.200
My brother and I haven't been
part of each other's lives

18:36.240 --> 18:38.160
these last ten years.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.920
I don't intend to change that.

18:41.600 --> 18:43.520
So you're prepared
to let him die?

18:53.880 --> 18:56.840
So much better, Sushma.
Come, sit down.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.560
Are you hungry?

19:06.920 --> 19:09.840
He's at work, I'm sure of it.

19:11.240 --> 19:12.840
I'm sure we'll find him soon.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.320
They promoted him, you know?

19:17.360 --> 19:20.360
He has 20 people
working under him.

19:20.400 --> 19:23.920
He's doing very well
for himself.

19:23.960 --> 19:28.000
Rajan once tried to tell me
what it was that he does.

19:28.040 --> 19:33.200
Something to do with
mixing rubber and plastic.

19:33.240 --> 19:36.800
He's a chemist, you see, but I
don't understand these things.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.600
That makes two of us.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.720

injuries, possible rib fracture.

- Take her to the X-Ray now.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.720
My mother...
My mother, is she here?

20:23.760 --> 20:25.440
Who is your mother?

20:25.480 --> 20:26.920
Sushma.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.840
- Sushma Variar?
- Is she here?

20:29.880 --> 20:32.600
Yes. Some mild concussion,
some bumps and bruises.

20:32.640 --> 20:35.520
She's been asking about your
father. Do you know where he is?

20:36.480 --> 20:38.920
He died four years ago.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.560
Dad. Dad. We've got a problem.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.000
That will have to wait.
We have found Sushma's daughter.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.960
That's the problem.
I can't find Sushma, she's gone.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.120
That's the brother.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.040
He was pretty reluctant
to come in.

20:52.080 --> 20:54.960
I think there's been some
kind of big family argument.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.280
The best thing I ever did
was to put 5,000 miles

20:57.320 --> 20:58.800
between me and my family.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.960
We've got on brilliantly ever
since. Christmas is a dream.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.280
I'll stay and make sure
he doesn't change his mind.

21:04.320 --> 21:05.960
Let's hope he's a match.

21:12.080 --> 21:13.480
Surprise!

21:13.520 --> 21:14.880
Hey.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.400
- What are you up to?
- Working, obviously.

21:17.440 --> 21:18.960
You're still pissed off with me

21:19.000 --> 21:21.120
about the other night
with my parents.

21:21.160 --> 21:23.160
Oh, come on, I did say sorry.

21:23.200 --> 21:24.600
Yeah, in a text.

21:24.640 --> 21:26.360
And I genuinely am.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.440
I shouldn't have put you
in that situation.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.240
No, you shouldn't.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.400
And you're an amazing person
and you're kind

21:32.440 --> 21:34.600
and you're probably great
with animals...

21:34.640 --> 21:37.480
- Enough. Come on.
- So, are we good then?

21:39.160 --> 21:41.160
Yeah, I suppose.

21:41.200 --> 21:44.080
Brilliant, cos you're taking me
to a party tonight.

21:44.120 --> 21:47.680
Sorry...let me rephrase that.

21:47.720 --> 21:49.400
Are you free tonight?

21:49.440 --> 21:51.880
My shift ends at six, hm?

21:53.440 --> 21:54.800
So it's a date.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.120
Don't be late.

21:56.160 --> 21:57.520
Hm.

21:59.160 --> 22:01.080
- Get out of here.
- [She laughs]

22:05.400 --> 22:07.720
How much longer?

22:07.760 --> 22:10.440
It'll take a while
and then you'll need to rest.

22:10.480 --> 22:13.040
Some people feel light-headed
after giving blood.

22:13.080 --> 22:15.000
No, I'm just going to go.

22:16.520 --> 22:18.360
Look,
I don't want to interfere...

22:18.400 --> 22:20.120
Then don't.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.440
I'm sorry.
Being here isn't easy.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.240
When he was trapped
in that rubble,

22:29.280 --> 22:32.200
he said that if anything
happened, I should find you.

22:32.240 --> 22:35.320
Why are you telling me this?

22:35.360 --> 22:37.680
He asked me to tell you
he's sorry.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.480
Do you have brothers or sisters?

22:44.280 --> 22:46.200
I grew up alone,
just me and my mum.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.960
I was so proud of him
when we were boys.

22:54.160 --> 22:56.080
He could do no wrong.

22:57.840 --> 22:59.760
I would always look out for him.

23:02.520 --> 23:04.440
And then he started drinking.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.160
And he changed.

23:08.200 --> 23:12.520
He lost his job, he lost his
friends. He lost everything.

23:12.560 --> 23:15.040
He said he'd stop drinking
and when you love someone,

23:15.080 --> 23:16.880
you want to believe them,
don't you?

23:16.920 --> 23:19.640
But you know alcoholism
is a disease?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.520
Mohanan killed his wife.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.320
He strangled her
in front of their son.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.720
Shyam lives with me now.

23:29.760 --> 23:32.160
Since that day he hasn't spoken.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.880
My brother spent
ten years in jail.

23:34.920 --> 23:36.520
I'll give him my blood.

23:36.560 --> 23:38.640
But I won't make
any excuses for him.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.600
Not any more.

23:46.600 --> 23:47.640
Excuse me.

23:53.240 --> 23:55.200

has increased.

23:55.240 --> 23:57.240
He must be bleeding internally.

- The bloods match.
- Excellent.

away. Good call on the brother.

why we had to come here.

Isn't it a bit... I dunno...

A bit what?

- Will you please relax?

You, my friend, worry too much.

interesting and you're funny -

24:53.040 --> 24:54.600
in your own way.

24:54.640 --> 24:58.080
Just do what you'd normally do
when you meet people on holiday.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.760
- Talk about football.
- There you go.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.360
- Tell a couple of jokes.
- If you like.

25:01.400 --> 25:02.880
Maybe do a card trick?

25:02.920 --> 25:04.880
Just be yourself!

25:04.920 --> 25:08.200
You don't have to do
a card trick or tell a joke

25:08.240 --> 25:10.160
or juggle
on a ruddy unicycle.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.320

with some friends.

Right, Jackie,
tell me when to stop.

25:25.640 --> 25:27.000
OK.

Mm...stop!

And this is your card.

- No.

Oh, bugger!

25:36.840 --> 25:41.360
In that case...
this is the seven of clubs.

25:41.400 --> 25:44.400
- Oh...
- This is going well!

was the seven of clubs?

Get me size 3 vicryl, we need to
suture those vessels right away

26:13.480 --> 26:14.880
or we'll lose him.

26:16.880 --> 26:18.200
Dr Walker?

26:19.240 --> 26:20.680
There.

26:20.720 --> 26:23.880
- [Bleeping]
- Suction.

26:23.920 --> 26:26.560
He's losing too much blood,
you'll have to manually compress

26:26.600 --> 26:29.000
whilst I try to find
the laceration sites.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.240
Grab hold of the liver,
press down and squeeze.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.480
- [Lydia's voice fades out]
- Dr Walker?

26:34.840 --> 26:36.840
[Muffled] Dr Walker?

26:36.880 --> 26:38.080
[Muffled] Dr Walker?

26:38.120 --> 26:40.040
[Clearly] Ruby? Please help me.

26:41.040 --> 26:43.040
[Bleeping continues]

26:43.080 --> 26:45.880
Hold at the bottom of the right
lobe above the gall bladder.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.840
[Bleeping continues]

27:00.960 --> 27:03.520
What was all that about?

27:03.560 --> 27:06.360
I'm sorry,
I just lost concentration.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.400
I'm aware of that.
I want to know why.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.840
It won't happen again.

27:22.920 --> 27:24.840
[Train's whistle]

27:41.880 --> 27:43.280
Thank you.

27:49.480 --> 27:51.880
Hello, Sushma.
We've been looking for you.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.080
This isn't his station.

27:59.120 --> 28:03.720
At first I thought it was
but then I remembered.

28:07.600 --> 28:09.520
I remembered everything.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.640
Let us get you
back to the hospital.

28:14.680 --> 28:16.600
I'll explain everything to you.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.880
He's not coming back, is he?

28:24.240 --> 28:25.840
I'm sorry.

28:28.760 --> 28:32.920
I keep telling myself
that I'm...getting better.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.240
But I'm not, am I?

28:48.680 --> 28:52.040
I used to come
and meet his train.

28:54.360 --> 28:56.480
He used to look
so handsome in his suit.

29:01.400 --> 29:03.320
I thought he would be here.

29:09.640 --> 29:11.560
My wife died 15 years ago.

29:14.400 --> 29:16.880
Sometimes I'll be just going
through my day

29:16.920 --> 29:19.680
and suddenly a song...

29:22.120 --> 29:25.480
..or a whiff of her perfume
will remind me of her.

29:34.560 --> 29:36.480
Let's go, shall we?

29:38.880 --> 29:41.960
Can we just sit here for
a little while longer, please?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.480
OK.

29:58.800 --> 29:59.920
Anupa?

30:04.680 --> 30:06.600
What happened?

30:08.640 --> 30:10.760
I was in the accident,
the same as you.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.280
You remember?

30:13.280 --> 30:14.640
Where's Rajan?

30:16.480 --> 30:18.520
He's fine. Daddy's gone fishing.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.560
He'll be home tomorrow.

30:20.600 --> 30:23.280
I've spoken to him
and he knows we're all right.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.240
Fishing?

30:27.040 --> 30:30.240
Can you please take care of
Sushma? I need to talk to Anupa.

30:42.720 --> 30:44.240
[Ram sighs]

30:47.480 --> 30:51.160
So what type of dementia
does she have?

30:52.200 --> 30:54.520
Alzheimer's, early onset.

30:56.360 --> 30:58.360
She's had it for
a couple of years.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.280
She has good days and bad days.

31:01.320 --> 31:05.040
Sometimes she's clear
as a bell, but other days...

31:06.240 --> 31:08.880
That's very common.

31:08.920 --> 31:12.680
And very frustrating for you,
I'm sure.

31:12.720 --> 31:14.960
I've tried telling her
but she forgets

31:15.000 --> 31:18.440
and then I have to
tell her again.

31:18.480 --> 31:22.200
Each morning she finds out
as if for the first time.

31:22.240 --> 31:25.320
So now I just tell a kind lie.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.920
"He's gone fishing.
He's at work.

31:26.960 --> 31:29.640
He's at the cricket."

31:29.680 --> 31:32.640
Don't worry, we'll arrange for
someone to take care of her

31:32.680 --> 31:35.200
until such time that
you are back on your feet.

31:55.280 --> 31:58.480
I found out what he did,
why the brothers don't talk.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.680
Mohanan killed his wife.

32:02.720 --> 32:05.640
It took me out of it
for a second. I'm sorry.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.400
When I was
a junior doctor in A&E,

32:12.440 --> 32:16.120
the first life I ever saved was
a young man, early-20s.

32:16.160 --> 32:20.040
He'd had a full-on cardiac
arrest, down for ten minutes.

32:20.080 --> 32:23.400
We brought him back
and he made a full recovery.

32:23.440 --> 32:26.480
Turns out he was an armed robber
who'd shot a policeman.

32:28.680 --> 32:32.520
We treat what's in front of us
and we move on.

32:32.560 --> 32:35.720
This job is hard enough without
making moral judgments.

32:45.400 --> 32:47.400
You asked me this morning
if I was OK.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.640
I'm not.

32:52.320 --> 32:54.920
I came out here because
my old life wasn't working.

32:56.640 --> 32:58.560
And I wanted a new beginning.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.000
And now everything's more
complicated than ever.

33:03.040 --> 33:05.000
In what way?

33:05.040 --> 33:11.680
If I can't trust my judgment and
keep feeling let down by people,

33:11.720 --> 33:13.720
I'm never going to belong
anywhere.

33:18.200 --> 33:20.080
I wish I could make you
feel better

33:20.120 --> 33:23.000
but I don't have an answer
to that one.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.480
But what I can do is take you
for a drink with some friends.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.440
What do you say?

33:36.080 --> 33:38.000
[Laughter]

33:41.520 --> 33:43.400
OK. Is he an actor?

33:43.440 --> 33:45.440
- Yes.
- I've never heard of him!

33:45.480 --> 33:47.640
What d'you mean
you've never heard of him?

33:47.680 --> 33:49.160
He was... [Whispers] Batman.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.200
Ah. Ah. Is it that guy...

33:51.240 --> 33:53.720
er, er...Christian...

33:53.760 --> 33:56.000
- No.
- You'll never get it, Bev.

33:56.040 --> 33:57.800
Hey, no cheating! Oh, Bev!

33:57.840 --> 33:59.440
Adam West? Who's that?

33:59.480 --> 34:02.800
He was the original Batman
in the TV series.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.840
God, you're making me
feel old now.

34:04.880 --> 34:06.800
That's cos you are old.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.840
Right, same again?

34:09.880 --> 34:12.840
I'll have a beer this time.
This isn't doing it for me.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.199
Ooh, says the cocktail
connoisseur.

34:15.239 --> 34:17.360
Have you ever had
one of his cocktails?

34:17.400 --> 34:19.080
They're a crime
against humanity.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.040
- Oi!
- [Laughter]

34:22.080 --> 34:24.000
Jacks, help me carry.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.800
See?
I told you they were a laugh.

34:28.840 --> 34:30.800
PAUL: Yeah, they're all right.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.840
Apart from when
they're calling me old.

34:32.880 --> 34:34.880
Are my cocktails
really that bad?

34:34.920 --> 34:36.840
- Bloody awful.
- Yeah.

34:44.400 --> 34:47.159
OK, so the bad news is
I'm still banned from driving

34:47.199 --> 34:50.440
but the good news is
I've got an amazing Plan B

34:50.480 --> 34:52.239
to get us to the party.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.360
- [She gasps]
- Your chariot awaits.

34:54.400 --> 34:57.720
Oh, my God, this is brilliant!
We're gonna have so much fun.

34:57.760 --> 34:59.800
There's so many people
I want you to meet.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.040
Uh-uh.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.920
Thank you, sir.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.840
- Comfortable?
- Very.

35:07.880 --> 35:09.800
- Hold on tight.
- OK!

35:10.840 --> 35:12.760
[She giggles]

35:17.080 --> 35:19.000
- [Bell rings]
- Whoo!

35:24.440 --> 35:26.040
Very nice!

35:26.080 --> 35:27.760
It's a perfect fit.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.800
There's Mala for you.

35:29.840 --> 35:32.120
She got this made to measure
and sent it to me.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.760
I haven't had to do a thing,
the woman's a machine.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.520
We should get her to work here.

35:36.560 --> 35:40.120
It's a far cry from
the first time I got married.

35:40.160 --> 35:43.480
I never thought I'd...
I'd do this again.

35:44.960 --> 35:47.840
You're not having any doubts,
are you?

35:47.880 --> 35:52.000
No, I love Mala.
I'm certain of that.

35:53.200 --> 35:55.120
It's just that...

35:56.360 --> 35:58.280
When Deepa died...

35:59.920 --> 36:01.840
..I still loved her.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.480
I still do.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.040
I'm sure she would understand.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.040
She would.

36:20.400 --> 36:24.280
Now...I thought
I'd take us all for a drink.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.880
That sounds like a good idea.

36:46.520 --> 36:47.960
Mr Kalita?

36:53.080 --> 36:56.840
Shyam knows his father has been
away, but he doesn't know why.

37:00.400 --> 37:03.000
He's getting to an age now...

37:03.040 --> 37:05.560
He'll have to make his own
decision about him.

37:09.080 --> 37:12.280
For what it's worth, I think the
longer you leave these things,

37:12.320 --> 37:13.640
the harder it gets.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.040
I used to think it would be
easier if he hated his father.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.160
Certainly easier for me.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.680
You love Shyam, right?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.920
Like he was my own.

37:35.080 --> 37:38.040
Then it... it's probably not
a case of if you tell him...

37:38.080 --> 37:39.840
but when.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.560
So when the time is right...

37:45.840 --> 37:47.760
..just tell him the truth.

37:51.040 --> 37:52.600
Would you want to know?

37:56.440 --> 37:57.960
Yeah.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.200
I would.

38:24.480 --> 38:26.720
- Busy day, no?
- You could say that.

38:26.760 --> 38:29.040
Lydia's treating everyone
to drinks later.

38:29.080 --> 38:31.080
Oh, is it that time of year
already?

38:31.120 --> 38:33.240
I think I'm gonna abuse
her hospitality

38:33.280 --> 38:34.880
and get incredibly drunk.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.200
It would be very rude of me
to let you drink alone.

38:37.240 --> 38:38.720
- This is true.
- Hm.

38:38.760 --> 38:40.680
- See you there?
- I think so.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.120
[Horn toots]

38:49.880 --> 38:51.480
[Mellow jazz plays]

38:51.520 --> 38:53.440
- Hi, Mandeep.
- Hello, Mandeep.

38:54.640 --> 38:56.840
That's Smiti and Jisha.

38:56.880 --> 39:00.160
You will love Jisha, she's got
a really dark sense of humour.

39:00.720 --> 39:02.360
Ben?

39:02.400 --> 39:04.320
- Hey.
- Hey, gorgeous.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.800
AJ, this is Ben.
Ben, this is AJ.

39:10.840 --> 39:13.280
- Hi.
- Hey.

Hey, Ben, Ajin's here.
Come and say hi.

39:18.880 --> 39:20.640
Hey. Hey. Who's Ben?

39:20.680 --> 39:22.000
He's my friend.

39:24.320 --> 39:28.080
Come on, Mandeep,
I thought we were on a date?

39:30.200 --> 39:32.120
AJ, I like you, but...

39:33.520 --> 39:35.440
Oh, you're teasing me!

39:36.680 --> 39:38.320
- [Giggles]
- Yeah.

39:38.360 --> 39:41.160
- Yeah, yeah. Totally.
- Oh, my God, don't do that.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.680
I thought I'd broke your heart
or something.

39:43.720 --> 39:47.320
Go get yourself a drink and I'll
introduce you to everyone later.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.880
[Laughter and chatter]

40:10.160 --> 40:12.760
God, I always forget
how hot it is here.

40:12.800 --> 40:14.800
That's why I often favour
a sarong.

40:14.840 --> 40:16.920
I'd rather sweat
and look like a man.

40:16.960 --> 40:20.600
Oh, that's a lovely image,
isn't it? Thanks for that.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.680
Hey, you know what we should do?
We should go for a swim!

40:23.720 --> 40:25.800
- Oh, yeah!
- I dunno.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.240
Oh, come on.

40:27.280 --> 40:30.440
Sod it, come on, let's get in!
Come on!

40:30.480 --> 40:32.720
- Come on, Paul.
- [Giggling]

40:32.760 --> 40:35.160
- So where is Greg?
- He's out with friends.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.720
But he won't mind us
making ourselves at home.

40:40.240 --> 40:43.520
And the Lord said,
"Let there be light."

40:43.560 --> 40:46.280
- And there was light!
- Right, who wants what?

40:46.320 --> 40:48.680
Beer. All of it.

40:48.720 --> 40:51.440
Oh, God, there's a lock
on the cabinet. No.

40:51.480 --> 40:54.360
The thing about Greg is
he never changes anything.

40:54.400 --> 40:57.720
- Take that!
- [Mari laughs]

40:57.760 --> 41:00.840
Do we keep a tab or do we have
to keep it in our heads?

41:00.880 --> 41:03.840
Oh, I'll just pay him in kind.
What do you want to drink?

41:03.880 --> 41:06.000
- Tequila.
- OK, tequila.

- Mari, do you want some wine?
- Hi.

41:09.120 --> 41:10.880

- Hey.

41:15.360 --> 41:17.320
[Music starts playing]

41:17.360 --> 41:19.280
So how've you been?

41:23.800 --> 41:25.720
Generally, I mean.

41:27.640 --> 41:30.000
Good. You?

41:31.400 --> 41:34.160
Er...good.

41:35.840 --> 41:37.040
Good.

41:42.280 --> 41:44.520
Actually,
I've probably been better.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.440
Hey.

41:52.240 --> 41:54.240
I thought you had plans.

41:54.280 --> 41:56.200
Yeah, so did I.

- There you go.
- Thanks.

42:17.080 --> 42:19.000
Did I interrupt something?

42:20.880 --> 42:22.800
Er...no.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.120
Well, maybe.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.280
It's a long story.

42:29.320 --> 42:31.240
- Then don't bother.
- [Laughs]

42:33.360 --> 42:36.280
Do you ever feel like
you can't doing anything right?

42:38.800 --> 42:42.240
Like you're making a series
of terrible decisions?

42:43.520 --> 42:45.440
Of course, all the time.

42:46.720 --> 42:49.480
Why?

42:49.520 --> 42:53.360
I need to figure out
what I'm doing with my life.

42:53.400 --> 42:56.120
It's got to be better
than mopping floors

42:56.160 --> 42:57.840
and washing sheets
all the time.

42:58.960 --> 43:00.800
You've got plenty of time, huh?

43:03.360 --> 43:05.200
You know what? Come on.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.760
Let's go get our drinks.

43:09.800 --> 43:12.640
RAM: Cheers, ladies.
- Cheers.

43:12.680 --> 43:15.000
- Cheers.
- [Glasses clink]

43:15.040 --> 43:17.040
Ah, Gabriel, this is for you.

43:17.080 --> 43:20.960
- Mari, how about a dance?
- Oh, no, not your dancing.

43:21.000 --> 43:22.960
Why, what's wrong
with my dancing?

43:23.000 --> 43:24.520
How long have you got?

43:24.560 --> 43:26.440
Ah, is that so?
OK, I'll prove you wrong.

43:26.480 --> 43:27.880
- [Music plays]
- Mari.

43:27.920 --> 43:29.720
- Oh, yes?
- Here we are.

43:29.760 --> 43:31.760
Oh, God, somebody stop him!

43:31.800 --> 43:33.800
Are you all right?

43:33.840 --> 43:35.760
[Ram and Mari laugh]

43:37.400 --> 43:40.520
- Lead me.
- [Laughs] I don't want to...

43:40.560 --> 43:43.240
- You're not even... Oh, my God!
- [Ram hums]

43:43.280 --> 43:45.200
[Laughter]

43:51.280 --> 43:53.240
Here comes Baywatch!

43:53.280 --> 43:56.400
I used to be a lifeguard in
Stourbridge Leisure Centre.

43:56.440 --> 43:58.360
Was that in the 1950s?

43:58.400 --> 44:01.040
Don't knock it,
ladies love a lifeguard.

44:01.080 --> 44:05.800
[Sings drunkenly] â™ª All
the ladies love a life guard

44:05.840 --> 44:08.680
â™ª All the ladies love our Paul

44:08.720 --> 44:10.720
Oh, my God, I've got crabs.

44:10.760 --> 44:13.920
- I've got crabs!
- [Screams and laughter]

44:13.960 --> 44:16.560
- It's only seaweed!
- Oh, you swine!

44:16.600 --> 44:18.200
Ah, get off!

44:18.240 --> 44:20.160
Jacks, help me get him!

44:21.400 --> 44:23.320
[Giggling and laughter]

44:25.040 --> 44:27.960
GREG: Come on,
it was just a bit of seaweed!

44:28.000 --> 44:29.720
Get off!

44:29.760 --> 44:31.680
[Laughter]

44:34.160 --> 44:36.360
[Laughter continues]

44:36.400 --> 44:38.320
[Maggie laughs]

44:45.680 --> 44:47.080
[Laughs]

45:19.160 --> 45:21.360
Paul? Paul, where are you?
We need you.

45:21.400 --> 45:23.880
- [Laughter]
- Paul?

45:26.040 --> 45:28.080
Paul? Paul?

45:29.305 --> 45:35.602
