00:00.913 --> 00:02.480
IT'S FUNNY, ISN'T IT?

00:02.480 --> 00:05.135
DEAD CARS ARE QUITE BEAUTIFUL
IN THEIR WAY,

00:05.135 --> 00:07.094
WHEREAS DEAD PEOPLE--
NOT SO MUCH.HUH?

00:07.094 --> 00:09.139
I SUPPOSE IF WE WERE CARS,

00:09.139 --> 00:11.750
THIS PLACE WOULD BE
A HORRIFIC CHARNEL HOUSE.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.709
UGH. IT'S TOO EARLY
FOR PHILOSOPHY.

00:13.709 --> 00:15.102
NEVER TOO EARLY.

00:15.102 --> 00:16.712
HEY, CHO!

00:16.712 --> 00:18.888
[Cho] HEY.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.238
OVER HERE.
I GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

00:21.238 --> 00:26.069
[dog barking]

00:26.069 --> 00:28.071
HEY, WE'VE GOT
AN UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE,

00:28.071 --> 00:31.248
SOMEWHERE IN HER LATE TEENS,
EARLY 20s.

00:31.248 --> 00:33.598
OH, WOW. A LITTLE NOTICE
WOULD'VE BEEN NICE.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.600
[Lisbon]
BE GRATEFUL IT'S WINTERTIME.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.124
IT COULD BE A LOT WORSE.[groans]

00:37.124 --> 00:38.690
LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS BLUDGEONED
MULTIPLE TIMES

00:38.690 --> 00:41.302
AROUND HER LEFT TEMPLE.
THERE'S SOME SERIOUS

00:41.302 --> 00:44.609
BLUNT FORCE TRAUMA TO
THE BACK OF HER HEAD AS WELL.SOMEBODY WANTED HER GOOD
AND DEAD.

00:44.609 --> 00:47.221
HOW LONG HAS SHE BEEN DOWN?[Cho] FROM THE DECOMPOSITION
OF THE BODY,

00:47.221 --> 00:50.528
SHE'S PROBABLY BEEN OUT HERE
AT LEAST A WEEK.[nasal voice]
IS THAT THE GUY WHO FOUND HER?

00:50.528 --> 00:52.356
[Cho] YEAH,
CAME ACROSS THE VICTIM

00:52.356 --> 00:55.185
WHEN HE WAS COMBING
THROUGH THE VAN.IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY

00:55.185 --> 00:56.969
TOOK SOMETHING OFF OF HER
AFTER SHE WAS ALREADY HERE.A WATCH OR A BRACELET,
I'M GUESSING.

00:56.969 --> 00:59.668
LEFT THE EARRINGS THOUGH. FOUND
A SET OF TRACKS OVER THERE.

00:59.668 --> 01:02.627
I THINK THEY'RE CONNECTED.IT'S A SALVAGE AREA. THERE'D
HAVE TO BE LOTS OF TRACKS.

01:02.627 --> 01:05.587
[Cho] YEAH, IT'S A LONG SHOT,
BUT THERE WEREN'T MANY TRACKS

01:05.587 --> 01:08.068
IN THE AREA,
AND THESE LOOK PRETTY FRESH.

01:10.157 --> 01:11.549
SMELLS LIKE
TRANSMISSION FLUID.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.160
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

01:13.160 --> 01:15.336
I'LL HAVE FORENSICS RUN
SOME TESTS.

01:15.336 --> 01:18.382
NOW IF A VEHICLE WITH A LEAKING
TRANSMISSION MADE THE TRACK,

01:18.382 --> 01:20.993
THEN THE DRIVER COULDN'T HAVE
GONE FAR WITHOUT SERVICE.[continues barking]

01:20.993 --> 01:23.735
HEY, WHAT'S--
WHAT'S HIS NAME?FRANKLIN.

01:23.735 --> 01:25.128
COOL, IT BOY.

01:25.128 --> 01:27.565
MAY I?
I HAVE A WAY WITH DOGS.

01:27.565 --> 01:30.046
HEY, FRANKLIN. HOW ARE YOU?[speaking indistinctly]

01:30.046 --> 01:32.179
YEAH, YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

01:32.179 --> 01:35.182
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU HAD A WAY WITH DOGS.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.748
HE WANTED FREEDOM.

01:36.748 --> 01:38.098
FRANKLIN! HEEL!

01:48.456 --> 01:50.284
GET OUT OF THERE,
FRANKLIN.

01:50.284 --> 01:53.113
AAH! IT'S A FOOT!

01:53.113 --> 01:54.288
OHH!

01:58.335 --> 02:01.077
ANOTHER BODY. ARE YOU DONE?

02:01.077 --> 02:04.733
HEY, WHAT DO YOU SAY, FRANKLIN?
ARE WE DONE YET? HUH, WE DONE?

02:04.733 --> 02:05.690
♪♪

02:17.702 --> 02:20.357
THE TEST CONFIRMED THERE WAS
A LOT OF TRANSMISSION FLUID

02:20.357 --> 02:22.664
IN THAT TRACK AT THE SCENE.

02:22.664 --> 02:25.841
AND THE TIRE PATTERN ONLY FITS
A FEW SPECIFIC VAN MODELS.I'M CHECKING GARAGES

02:25.841 --> 02:28.060
TO SEE IF ANY VEHICLES
FITTING THE DESCRIPTION

02:28.060 --> 02:30.062
WERE TURNED IN
WITH TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS

02:30.062 --> 02:33.414
OVER THE LAST WEEK.ALL RIGHT.
CHO, YOU MIND HELPING HIM OUT?

02:35.024 --> 02:37.026
IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?NO.

02:37.026 --> 02:40.725
NO, MA'AM.GREAT. I SEE A NAME.
DID WE I.D. THE VICTIMS?

02:40.725 --> 02:42.727
ONLY ON ONE.
GOT A HIT ON HER PRINTS.

02:42.727 --> 02:44.729
IT'S FOR THE SECOND VICTIM
YOU FOUND.

02:44.729 --> 02:47.079
HER NAME WAS VALERIE BESTIN.
NO NEXT OF KIN.

02:47.079 --> 02:50.126
SHE WAS ARRESTED FOUR YEARS AGO
AFTER HITTING A HOMELESS MAN

02:50.126 --> 02:53.390
WHILE DRIVING DRUNK.THE M.E. PUTS HER TIME OF DEATH
WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.870
BESTIN WAS BLUDGEONED
IN THE SAME MANNER

02:54.870 --> 02:57.089
AS THE FIRST VICTIM.

02:57.089 --> 03:00.136
WHAT ABOUT AN I.D.
ON THE OTHER VICTIM?HER PRINTS HAVEN'T COME UP YET.

03:00.136 --> 03:02.138
THE M.E. PEGS HER
AS LATINA, EARLY 20s.

03:02.138 --> 03:04.488
DO A PRELIMINARY SEARCH OF
THE MISSING PERSONS DATABASE.

03:04.488 --> 03:06.447
MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY.YES, MA'AM.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.449
ALL RIGHT, WE'VE GOT
TWO VICTIMS--ONE CAUCASIAN,

03:08.449 --> 03:10.364
THE OTHER PROBABLY LATINA.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.670
AT LEAST A 10-YEAR AGE GAP
BETWEEN THEM,

03:12.670 --> 03:15.282
AND JUDGING BY THEIR CLOTHES,
VALERIE HAD MORE MONEY.

03:15.282 --> 03:19.068
BUT BOTH WERE BLUDGEONED
AND DUMPED IN THE SAME PLACE

03:19.068 --> 03:21.723
ONE WEEK AFTER THE OTHER.
WHAT'S THE CONNECTION?LIBRARY, BOWLING ALLEY,
NAIL SALON. COULD BE ANYTHING.

03:21.723 --> 03:22.985
WELL, LET'S FOCUS
ON WHAT WE DOKNOW.

03:22.985 --> 03:25.466
WHAT ABOUT THE HOMELESS GUY
BESTIN HIT?

03:25.466 --> 03:29.121
HE'S BEEN IN A SECURE
MENTAL FACILITY SINCE LAST YEAR.SPEAKING OF MENTAL FACILITIES,

03:29.121 --> 03:31.820
HAVE YOU SEEN JANE?
I NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.520
JANE?

03:36.520 --> 03:38.870
HMM?

03:38.870 --> 03:40.263
WHERE'S MY COUCH?

03:40.263 --> 03:42.352
OH.

03:42.352 --> 03:44.702
YES. I BOUGHT YOU
A NEW ONE.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.878
I LIKE MY OLD COUCH.NO, YOU DON'T.

03:46.878 --> 03:50.012
YOU'VE GOTTA TRY THIS ONE.LET'S DISCUSS IT LATER.
WE HAVE TO TALK.

03:50.012 --> 03:52.275
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
INTO KNITTING?WHAT?

03:52.275 --> 03:55.235
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
YOU GREW UP SURROUNDED BY BOYS.WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

03:55.235 --> 03:58.238
HI THERE. YOU SEEM TO HAVE
VERY NIMBLE FINGERS.

03:58.238 --> 04:01.458
ARE YOU NOW OR HAVE YOU
EVER BEEN A KNITTER?NO. AGENT LISBON.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.026
YES, DR. MONTAGUE.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

04:04.026 --> 04:07.334
AND YOU MUST BE PATRICK JANE.I MUST BE. YOU WERE SAYING
WE NEEDED TO TALK.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.597
YES, DR. MONTAGUE
IS CONSULTING ON THE CASE.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.076
OH?

04:11.076 --> 04:13.078
YES, SHE'S
A DECISION SCIENCE CONSULTANT.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.951
SHE WORKS WITH THE FBI
AND STATE AGENCIES.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.301
HER WORK HELPED BRING IN
THE QUARRY KILLER.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.303
I'M DEVELOPING
A PREDICTIVE COMPUTER MODEL.

04:20.303 --> 04:23.524
IT IDENTIFIES THE PATTERNS IN
CRIMES AND ASSESSES WHETHER

04:23.524 --> 04:26.483
OR NOT THEY WERE COMMITTED
BY THE SAME PERPETRATOR.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.311
WOW. COOL.

04:28.311 --> 04:30.313
THE SYSTEMS FLAGGED
YOUR TWO MURDERS

04:30.313 --> 04:33.273
AS THE RE-EMERGENCE OF A KILLER
KNOWN AS "THE CAVEMAN."

04:33.273 --> 04:35.187
I REMEMBER HIM.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.451
HE BLUDGEONED HIS VICTIMS
WITH A WOODEN CLUB.

04:37.451 --> 04:39.148
THAT WAS TEN YEARS AGO.

04:39.148 --> 04:41.498
INDEED, BUT THE SIMILARITIES
BETWEEN HIS VICTIMS

04:41.498 --> 04:45.285
AND THE VICTIMS IN THIS CASE
ARE STATISTICALLY IDENTICAL.HOW SO?

04:45.285 --> 04:47.635
THE CAVEMAN ALWAYS PICKS
TWO VICTIMS, ONE WEEK APART.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.506
SAME PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES--

04:49.506 --> 04:52.988
BRUNETTES, 120 TO 140 POUNDS.
IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT,

04:52.988 --> 04:54.555
THE CHOICE SEEMS ENTIRELY
RANDOM--

04:54.555 --> 04:57.384
NO GEOGRAPHIC
OR DEMOGRAPHIC PATTERN.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.647
VICTIMS ARE BLUDGEONED
ON THE SIDE OF THE HEAD

04:59.647 --> 05:02.258
WITH A WOODEN OBJECT,
NO EVIDENCE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT,

05:02.258 --> 05:04.652
BODIES ARE LEFT IN WASTE SITES
AND SCRAP YARDS,

05:04.652 --> 05:06.610
AND THE VICTIMS
ARE UNKNOWN TO EACH OTHER.

05:06.610 --> 05:08.438
THIS IS CLASSIC CAVEMAN.

05:08.438 --> 05:11.049
HMM. WELL, AT LEAST
YOU'RE WRONG WITH CONVICTION.

05:11.049 --> 05:14.401
THESE TWO WOMEN KNEW
EACH OTHER.HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

05:14.401 --> 05:16.620
OKAY, SO THIS ONE...

05:16.620 --> 05:19.275
YES, NOW IF YOU LOOK
AT THE DETAIL

05:19.275 --> 05:23.584
IN THIS ROSE, AND THEN AGAIN
AT THE DETAIL IN THIS SCARF,

05:23.584 --> 05:25.586
THEY WERE BOTH DONE
BY THE SAME HAND.

05:25.586 --> 05:26.761
HMM. INTRIGUING
HANDICRAFT THEORY.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.197
YEAH.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.547
BUT EVEN IF WE WERE ABLE
TO ESTABLISH A LINK

05:30.547 --> 05:32.201
BETWEEN THE VICTIMS,

05:32.201 --> 05:34.638
IT DOESN'T EXCLUDE THE CAVEMAN
FROM BEING THE KILLER.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.771
IT MERELY EXPANDS
THE MODELING PARADIGM.

05:36.771 --> 05:38.860
MERELY EXPANDS
THE MODELING PARADIGM.

05:38.860 --> 05:42.080
WASN'T THE CAVEMAN KNOWN FOR
SENDING POETRY, ANIMAL ORGANS,

05:42.080 --> 05:44.082
EVEN CRUDE DRAWINGS
TO THE POLICE?

05:44.082 --> 05:46.084
WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

05:46.084 --> 05:48.043
WE WILL.HI, BOSS.

05:48.043 --> 05:50.393
FOUND OUT THAT VALERIE BESTIN
WAS A FINANCIAL DIRECTOR

05:50.393 --> 05:52.961
AT AN ONLINE COMPANY
CALLED AGILE TURTLE.

05:52.961 --> 05:54.745
DR. MONTAGUE, THIS IS
AGENT WAYNE RIGSBY.

05:54.745 --> 05:56.573
RIGSBY, DR. MONTAGUE'S
CONSULTING ON THE CASE,

05:56.573 --> 05:59.359
AND YOU'LL BE HER LIAISON.IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.450
WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HER
AROUND?ALL RIGHT, I CAN KEEP YOU
THE 50-CENT TOUR.

06:03.450 --> 06:05.452
START IN
THE MAJOR CRIMES SECTION.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.454
REALLY?
A DECISION SCIENCE CONSULTANT?

06:07.454 --> 06:09.456
DON'T START.
THIS GOES WAY ABOVE US.

06:09.456 --> 06:12.415
WE'RE GOOD TO THE FEDS,
THE FEDS WILL BE GOOD TO US.

06:12.415 --> 06:14.461
WHEN IN DOUBT,
DON'T ACT OUT.

06:14.461 --> 06:17.202
YOU JUST MADE A RHYME.
WHEN AM I EVER IN DOUBT?

06:17.202 --> 06:19.379
SERIOUSLY, YOU START TROUBLE,
AND I WILL...YOU'LL BURST MY BUBBLE?

06:26.603 --> 06:29.737
SHE WAS SUCH A GOOD PERSON,
YOU KNOW?

06:29.737 --> 06:32.304
SHE TOOK ALL THESE
UNDERPRIVILEGED-LIKE KIDS

06:32.304 --> 06:34.306
HIKING AT HALF DOME
EARLIER THIS YEAR.

06:34.306 --> 06:36.700
MR. BEECHUM, DID VALERIE
HAVE ANY FRIENDS OR CO-WORKERS

06:36.700 --> 06:39.311
THAT WERE YOUNG LATINAS?MM, NO.

06:39.311 --> 06:42.227
THERE'S NOT REALLY THAT
MANY WOMEN THAT WORK HERE.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.186
YOU HAD A CRUSH ON HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

06:44.186 --> 06:45.840
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

06:45.840 --> 06:47.232
ATTRACTIVE YOUNG WOMAN,

06:47.232 --> 06:50.497
SINGLE COMPUTER PROGRAMMER,
BIRDS, BEES.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.324
I COULD GO ON.

06:52.324 --> 06:54.936
I'M MORE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR
THAN A PROGRAMMER THESE DAYS,

06:54.936 --> 06:57.678
BUT THAT ISN'T
AN UNTRUE STATEMENT.

06:57.678 --> 07:00.158
SHE WAS A LOVELY LADY.

07:00.158 --> 07:03.031
HMM. BUT WHEN YOU MADE
YOUR MOVE, SHE SHOT YOU DOWN.

07:03.031 --> 07:05.555
NO. WELL...

07:05.555 --> 07:08.210
YEAH, I WOULDN'T REALLY
CALL IT A MOVE.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.255
BUT THERE WERE
NO HARD FEELINGS.

07:10.255 --> 07:13.302
I MEAN, IF I KILLED EVERY WOMAN
THAT SHOT ME DOWN,

07:13.302 --> 07:16.261
I WOULD BE A MONSTER.
YOU KNOW, WELL...

07:16.261 --> 07:18.350
I MEAN, I'M NOT...
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.135
MNH-MNH.

07:20.135 --> 07:23.181
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW VALERIE?

07:23.181 --> 07:25.009
UH, YESTERDAY AT WORK.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.011
OKAY,
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

07:27.011 --> 07:28.796
YOU DO?YES.

07:28.796 --> 07:30.798
OH, ACTUALLY, NO.
I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.

07:30.798 --> 07:33.409
WHERE'S THE NEAREST
HOMELESS SHELTER?

07:33.409 --> 07:36.281
VALERIE WAS DEEPLY GUILT-RIDDEN
OVER HITTING THE HOMELESS GUY.

07:36.281 --> 07:39.328
SHE STARTED COLLECTING SOAP,
SHAMPOO, AND CRAYONS.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.373
SHE WAS TAKING KIDS HIKING.

07:41.373 --> 07:43.767
SHE PROBABLY VOLUNTEERED
HER TIME--IN A HOMELESS SHELTER?

07:43.767 --> 07:45.943
SOMETIMES YOU ACT
LIKE I DON'T KNOW JACK.

07:45.943 --> 07:48.293
MORE RHYMING.
NOW THAT'S EVEN RAPPING.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.774
[rapping] ♪ SOMETIMES YOU ACT
LIKE I DON'T KNOW JACK ♪

07:50.774 --> 07:52.776

BACK THERE.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.257
YEAH.YEE-YEE.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.911
VALERIE BESTIN?

07:56.911 --> 07:59.261
OF COURSE.
SHE VOLUNTEERED HERE.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.219
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD
THE OTHER PEOPLE.

08:01.219 --> 08:03.352
WHAT OTHER PEOPLE?

08:03.352 --> 08:05.485
UM, THOSE PEOPLE.

08:07.574 --> 08:08.836
HI.

08:08.836 --> 08:10.881
HOW'D YOU KNOW
TO COME HERE?

08:10.881 --> 08:13.144
WOMEN ARE 17% MORE LIKELY
THAN MEN TO SELF-DIRECT

08:13.144 --> 08:15.799
INTO REDEMPTIVE RECOURSE
AFTER COMMITTING CRIMES.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.367
GIVEN VALERIE BESTIN'S
LACK OF RELAPSE AFTER D.U.I.

08:18.367 --> 08:20.369
WITH INJURY INCIDENT,
IT ONLY MADE SENSE

08:20.369 --> 08:21.979
THAT SHE WOULD FOLLOW
THE PATTERN,

08:21.979 --> 08:25.417
SO I CALLED TREATMENT FACILITIES
AND SHELTERS

08:25.417 --> 08:27.594
IN SURROUNDING AREAS
UNTIL I FOUND THE RIGHT PLACE.SO YOU... GUESSED.

08:27.594 --> 08:30.553
AH, IT'S MORE OF
A SCIENTIFIC HYPOTHESIS, REALLY.

08:30.553 --> 08:32.555
JUST KEEP US IN THE LOOP.NOTED.

08:32.555 --> 08:35.515
NEED TO HEAD BACK AND CODE THESE
INTERVIEWS. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US.

08:38.822 --> 08:41.172
YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
SHE REALLY KNOWS HER STUFF.

08:41.172 --> 08:43.435
I'M ADMITTING NOTHING.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.873
SHE'S HUFFING AND PUFFING.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.223
WAIT. THAT RHYMES.

08:48.223 --> 08:51.879
LIKE I TOLD DR. MONTAGUE,
I DIDN'T KNOW VALERIE VERY WELL.

08:51.879 --> 08:53.968
BUT SHE WOULD OFTEN BRING
DONATIONS WITH HER.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.491
DESPERATELY NEEDED.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.406
AH, WE'RE STRETCHED
PRETTY THIN AROUND HERE,

08:57.406 --> 08:59.495
SO OUR FOCUS
IS ON OUR GUESTS.

08:59.495 --> 09:02.629
UH, BUT PAULA HAD MORE CONTACT
WITH HER THAN I DID.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.631
VALERIE WAS A SAINT.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.850
SHE NEVER TALKED DOWN
TO NOBODY.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.287
ALWAYS MAKIN' SURE
WE WAS EATIN' BETTER,

09:09.287 --> 09:10.550
DRINKIN' LESS.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.074
OH, WHEN MARTY DIED,

09:13.074 --> 09:16.556
SHE WAS, LIKE... CRYIN'.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.079
SHE REALLY CARED.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.776
MARTY?

09:19.776 --> 09:24.172
A FORMER GUEST. HE PASSED AWAY
HERE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO.

09:24.172 --> 09:26.304
A BAD CASE OF FLU
SWEPT THROUGH HERE.

09:26.304 --> 09:29.307
LOT OF PEOPLE GOT SICK,
AND POOR MARTY'S SYSTEM JUST--

09:29.307 --> 09:32.049
JUST COULDN'T HANDLE IT,
YOU KNOW?

09:35.313 --> 09:37.054
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, JANE?

09:37.054 --> 09:40.144
UH, YES, UM, I DO HAVE
ONE MORE QUESTION...

09:40.144 --> 09:41.755
YEAH.IN FACT.

09:41.755 --> 09:45.062
DO EITHER OF YOU RECALL
WHETHER VALERIE WAS A-A KNITTER?

09:47.021 --> 09:49.719
KNITTING.THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.678
ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.335
JUST GOT BACK
THE FORENSICS REPORT.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.729
BOTH VICTIMS WERE BLUDGEONED
WITH THE SAME OBJECT.

09:59.729 --> 10:03.254
IDENTICAL WOOD FIBERS WERE
FOUND IN BOTH THEIR WOUNDS.

10:03.254 --> 10:07.084
SOUNDS LIKE THE CAVEMAN.I DON'T THINK HE HAS THE PATENT
ON KILLING WITH A 2x4.

10:07.084 --> 10:10.087
YOU KNOW, WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT
A PRESS RESPONSE TO THIS.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.612
BEING AHEAD OF MEDIA SPECULATION
MAKES US LOOK LESS REACTIVE.

10:12.612 --> 10:16.050
WELL, HANG ON. WE'RE NOT EVEN
SURE IT'S THE CAVEMAN.

10:16.050 --> 10:19.140
WE DON'T NEED TO SPEAK
TO THE PRESS JUST YET.I DISAGREE.

10:23.187 --> 10:25.146
[moans]

10:25.146 --> 10:29.367
BUT I HEAR YOU...
AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.369
YES, YOU HEAR ME,
MOST CERTAINLY.

10:31.369 --> 10:34.721
BUT I DOUBT VERY MUCH
YOU UNDERSTAND MY CONCERNS.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.071
IF YOU'RE SO SURE
THAT IT'S NOT THE CAVEMAN,

10:37.071 --> 10:39.116
WHY ARE YOU READING UP
ON HIS FILE?

10:39.116 --> 10:42.685
I LIKE TO READ. I HAVE INSOMNIA.
I DON'T LIKE WARM MILK.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.687
I'M LACTOSE-INTOLERANT.
I COULD GO ON.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.689
DID YOU KNOW
THAT HABITUAL MOCKERY

10:46.689 --> 10:48.996
IS A STRONG INDICATOR
OF DEPRESSION?

10:48.996 --> 10:53.391
NO. BUT THANK YOU
FOR ENLIGHTENING ME.

10:55.567 --> 10:58.266
UM, THAT WAS INAPPROPRIATE.

10:58.266 --> 11:00.442
I APOLOGIZE.

11:08.580 --> 11:10.582
[Rigsby] ONE OF THESE VANS

11:10.582 --> 11:13.194
HAS TO HAVE BEEN
AT THE SALVAGE AREA.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.543
HOW MANY LEFT?

11:14.543 --> 11:16.197
NINE.

11:16.197 --> 11:19.330
OH, WE ALREADY HIT EIGHT.
GOD, MY FEET HURT.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.029
YOUR FEET HURT?

11:22.029 --> 11:24.379
IS THERE SOME WAY
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT?

11:24.379 --> 11:28.470
WHAT?I HAVE TO SPELL IT OUT?
OKAY, LOOK, I LIED.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.777
I LIED TO THE P.S.U.
TO PROTECT MY DAD,

11:30.777 --> 11:33.910
AND YOU HAD TO LIE TO COVER ME,
AND I OWE YOU BIG-TIME.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.043
LOOK, I GET THAT YOU'RE MAD
AT ME, AND I'M SORRY.

11:36.043 --> 11:39.437
BUT PLEASE,
CAN WE MOVE PAST THIS?[woman moans]

11:39.437 --> 11:42.353
OKAY.OKAY? WHAT, LIKE--LIKE,
WE'REOKAY, OKAY?

11:45.269 --> 11:47.445
[knocks]POLICE!

11:47.445 --> 11:49.447
HEY, WHAT THE HELL, MAN?

11:49.447 --> 11:52.450
CBI. WE NEED TO ASK YOU
A COUPLE QUESTIONS.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.714
YOU THE OWNER OF THIS VAN?YEAH.

11:54.714 --> 11:58.152
YOU GET YOUR TRANSMISSION
FIXED THIS MORNING?YEAH. WHY?

11:58.152 --> 12:00.458
MA'AM, WHERE'D YOU GET
THAT BRACELET?

12:00.458 --> 12:03.548
AT THE NONE-OF-YOUR-DAMN-
BUSINESS STORE.

12:06.900 --> 12:08.902
SO DID YOUR FRIEND YASMEEN
IN THE BACK OF THE VAN

12:08.902 --> 12:11.295
KNOW WHERE THIS BRACELET
CAME FROM?

12:11.295 --> 12:14.385
OH, THAT WASN'T A FRIEND.
THAT WAS JUST A LITTLE DINNER.IT'S WEIRD THAT

12:14.385 --> 12:17.388
YOUR DINNER'S NAME WAS YASMEEN,
BUT THIS BRACELET YOU GAVE HER

12:17.388 --> 12:20.304
HAS THE INITIALS "F.T."
ENGRAVED ON IT.IMAGINE THAT.

12:20.304 --> 12:22.742
IT'S TOO BAD YOU FORGOT
THE MATCHING EARRINGS

12:22.742 --> 12:25.179
OFF THE WOMAN YOU KILLED.I DIDN'T KILL ANYBODY.

12:25.179 --> 12:29.226
THEN HOW'D YOU END UP
WITH A DEAD WOMAN'S BRACELET?

12:29.226 --> 12:32.664
YOU KNOW, DECOMPOSING BODIES CAN
STILL LEAVE A LOT OF EVIDENCE?

12:32.664 --> 12:35.667
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME
BEFORE THEY MATCH UP THE D.N.A.

12:35.667 --> 12:37.800
LEFT ON THIS BRACELET
TO HER BODY.

12:37.800 --> 12:41.761
LOOK... SOMETIMES
I HAUL JUNK TO THAT YARD.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.111
I WAS THERE LOOKING AROUND
FOR WHATEVER.

12:44.111 --> 12:47.549
THERE SHE WAS,
ALREADY DEAD.

12:47.549 --> 12:50.204
THE BRACELET WASN'T
DOING HER ANY GOOD.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.816
TOO MUCH OF A WUSS
TO BE A KILLER.

12:53.816 --> 12:57.559
LACKING IN GRANDIOSITY,
ONLY ONE DIVORCE,

12:57.559 --> 13:00.214
AN UNDERCURRENT OF RAGE
WOULD NORMALLY EXPRESS ITSELF

13:00.214 --> 13:02.216
AT LEAST IN A DRIVING RECORD.

13:02.216 --> 13:04.871
I'M NOT SEEING A PROPENSITY
FOR VIOLENCE HERE.

13:04.871 --> 13:08.396
SO YOU AGREE WITH ME?NOT OUR KILLER.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.180
HMM.

13:10.180 --> 13:12.052
[blinds rattle]THANK YOU.

13:12.052 --> 13:15.316
THE CAVEMAN WAS NEVER KNOWN TO
STEAL JEWELRY OFF HIS VICTIMS,

13:15.316 --> 13:17.318
SO THAT CLEARS UP
THAT ANOMALY.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.972
LIFE'S JUST ONE

13:18.972 --> 13:21.322
GIANT MATHEMATICAL EQUATION
FOR YOU, ISN'T IT?

13:21.322 --> 13:23.324
I WOULD LIKE THAT.
I CONFESS.

13:23.324 --> 13:24.934
THIS ISN'T THE CAVEMAN.

13:24.934 --> 13:26.327
SO YOU SAY.

13:26.327 --> 13:29.112
I GOT $1 THAT SAYS
THE SAME THING.

13:29.112 --> 13:32.333
I HAVE NO OBJECTION
TO GAMBLING. YOU'RE ON.

13:32.333 --> 13:33.987
HMM.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.077
OH, SOMEONE'S POPULAR.

13:37.077 --> 13:39.296
HARDLY.

13:39.296 --> 13:40.907
WHAT IS IT?

13:42.473 --> 13:44.824
OHH.LOOKS LIKE A KIDNEY.

13:44.824 --> 13:48.044
THERE'S A POEM ON THE OTHER SIDE
OF THAT PAPER, I SUSPECT?

13:48.044 --> 13:50.133
YOU'VE SEEN THIS BEFORE?

13:50.133 --> 13:52.222
"THE LADIES ARE DEAD.
I CRUSHED THEIR HEADS.

13:52.222 --> 13:54.877
AND AFTER THE LASH,
THEY GO INTO THE TRASH."

13:54.877 --> 13:56.574
IT'S FROM THE CAVEMAN.

13:56.574 --> 13:58.968
POETRY WEEK. YOU COULD'VE
DONE BETTER THAN THAT.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.318
I BELIEVE WE HAD A WAGER.

14:01.318 --> 14:02.972
AH. YEAH.

14:04.278 --> 14:05.801
THANK YOU.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.461
FROM AN INDIVIDUAL
CALLING HIMSELF "THE CAVEMAN,"

14:13.461 --> 14:15.419
WHO CLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE MURDER

14:15.419 --> 14:17.378
OF TWO LOCAL AREA WOMEN...

14:17.378 --> 14:18.553
HEY.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.555
MS. MONTAGUE IN HER ELEMENT.

14:20.555 --> 14:22.557
IT'S NOT OFTEN YOU SEE
A PROFILER

14:22.557 --> 14:24.515
BASKING IN THE SPOTLIGHT.

14:24.515 --> 14:27.127
WELL, MONTAGUE SAYS THAT
A KILLER LIKE THE CAVEMAN

14:27.127 --> 14:29.172
CRAVES ACKNOWLEDGMENT
FOR HIS CRIMES.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.174
GIVING HIM SOME ATTENTION
COULD KEEP HIM

14:31.174 --> 14:32.828
FROM TAKING ANOTHER VICTIM
EARLY.

14:32.828 --> 14:34.786
YOU LIKE MONTAGUE,
DON'T YOU?

14:34.786 --> 14:37.093
NO. I MEAN, I... DON'T
DISLIKEHER.

14:37.093 --> 14:38.486
WHAT'S TO DISLIKE?

14:38.486 --> 14:40.662
RIGHT. STILL WORKING ON, UH,

14:40.662 --> 14:42.664
WHERE THE CAVEMAN
SENT THE PACKAGE FROM,

14:42.664 --> 14:44.753
BUT WE GOT AN I.D.
ON THE OTHER VICTIM.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.407
EXCELLENT.FERNANDA TALAN.

14:46.407 --> 14:48.409
ENGRAVED INITIALS ON THE BACK
OF HER STOLEN BRACELET

14:48.409 --> 14:50.411
HELPED MAKE A POSITIVE MATCH.

14:50.411 --> 14:52.717
HER COUSINS REPORTED HER MISSING ABOUT A WEEK AGO.

14:52.717 --> 14:55.285
SHE WORKED FOR THEM AT A BOTTLING PLANT.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.551
AH. STILL WEARING THAT BROOCH,
I SEE,

15:00.551 --> 15:02.945
BUT WHERE'S THE POWER SUIT?[car alarm engages]

15:02.945 --> 15:04.947
WELL, WEARING A PALETTE
OF NEUTRAL TONES

15:04.947 --> 15:06.993
IS LESS THREATENING
WHEN INTERVIEWING PEOPLE.

15:06.993 --> 15:09.299
HI.Hey, boss.

15:09.299 --> 15:11.301
I JUST GOT VALERIE BESTIN'S
PHONE RECORDS.

15:11.301 --> 15:13.303
LATELY SHE'S BEEN GETTING
A LOT OF CALLS

15:13.303 --> 15:15.610
FROM DONOVAN TREADLOW,
THE HOMELESS SHELTER DIRECTOR.

15:15.610 --> 15:18.047
HE SAID HE BARELY KNEW HER.

15:18.047 --> 15:19.701
Well, he lied.

15:19.701 --> 15:22.312
TAKE CHO. GET THE STORY.

15:22.312 --> 15:24.619
FERNANDA WAS OUR COUSIN
FROM MY MOTHER'S FAMILY.

15:24.619 --> 15:26.447
SHE CAME TO US

15:26.447 --> 15:28.579
TO GET AWAY
FROM THE VIOLENCE IN OAKLAND.

15:28.579 --> 15:32.409
THIS WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN TO HER.

15:32.409 --> 15:36.022
HER BROTHER WAS KILLED
JUST LAST YEAR, AND NOW THIS?

15:36.022 --> 15:39.721
SHE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT.

15:39.721 --> 15:41.505
TRANQUILA,NILDA.

15:41.505 --> 15:43.899
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW FERNANDA?

15:43.899 --> 15:46.815
ABOUT A WEEK AGO.
SHE TOOK THE BUS AFTER WORK

15:46.815 --> 15:49.470
AND JUST VANISHED. WE WERE
WORRIED IMMEDIATELY WHEN

15:49.470 --> 15:53.691
SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP THE NEXT DAY
BECAUSE SHE NEVER MISSED WORK.WHERE DID SHE WORK?

15:53.691 --> 15:55.519
ON THE LINE.IN THERE?

15:55.519 --> 15:58.435
HAVE YOU SEE VALERIE BESTIN
AROUND YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD?

15:58.435 --> 16:00.176
NO.

16:00.176 --> 16:03.179
WE ONLY HEARD ABOUT HER
THROUGH THE NEWS AND YOU ALL.

16:03.179 --> 16:06.052
I LIKE THE PACKAGING.
WHAT FLAVOR IS THAT?

16:06.052 --> 16:09.359
UM... PROBABLY
OUR ORANGE CREAM SODAS,

16:09.359 --> 16:10.621
RIGHT, ESTHER?

16:10.621 --> 16:13.537
YES. WE MAKE NATURAL SODAS.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.539
NO CORN SYRUP,
NO ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS.

16:15.539 --> 16:18.412
WE EMPLOY LOCALS,
PAY THEM RIGHT.

16:18.412 --> 16:21.241
PEOPLE USED TO SHAKE THEIR HEADS
WHEN WE FIRST STARTED,

16:21.241 --> 16:24.026
BUT NOW THEY'RE GETTING IT.

16:24.026 --> 16:26.637
[Nilda] FERNANDA HAD MADE
A HUGE CHANGE HERE.

16:26.637 --> 16:29.031
SHE WANTED TO BE A NURSE
AND...

16:29.031 --> 16:32.600
[voice breaking]
IT'S JUST ALL SO SAD.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.560
IS THIS A BOY OR GIRL?
I CAN'T REALLY SEE.[Esther] IT'S A BOY.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.519
[Patrick] A BOY LIZARD.
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

16:38.519 --> 16:39.520
CHUY.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.043
HEY, CHUY.

16:41.043 --> 16:42.914
MS. MONTAGUE,
YOU'RE AWFULLY QUIET.

16:42.914 --> 16:45.526
I'M SURE YOU HAVE
SOME QUESTIONS.

16:45.526 --> 16:47.876
MS. MONTAGUE HERE--
SHE'S, UH, SUPER, SUPER CLEVER.

16:47.876 --> 16:51.010
SHE'S A SCIENTIST.THANK YOU, MR. JANE.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.489
OH, PLEASURE.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.752
DID FERNANDA EVER
ABUSE ALCOHOL?

16:54.752 --> 16:56.319
NO.

16:56.319 --> 16:58.539
WHAT ABOUT ILLEGAL
OR CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES?

16:58.539 --> 17:00.889
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY,

17:00.889 --> 17:02.978
THAT FERNANDA GOT MIXED UP
IN DRUGS?

17:02.978 --> 17:06.155
I'M LOOKING INTO TRAITS
AND HABITS WHICH MIGHT GIVE

17:06.155 --> 17:09.158
SOME INSIGHT INTO WHY
SHE WAS CHOSEN BY THE CAVEMAN.

17:09.158 --> 17:11.508
FINDING OUT WHY FERNANDA'S
TO BLAME FOR GETTING MURDERED?

17:11.508 --> 17:14.424
WHAT KIND OF QUACK ARE YOU?

17:14.424 --> 17:17.166
I'M SURE THAT'S NOT WHAT
DR. MONTAGUE MEANT.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.386
UH, IT APPEARS THAT
YOU'VE GOT THIS COVERED,

17:19.386 --> 17:22.345
SO I'M JUST GOING TO, UH,
GO INSIDE AND TAKE A LOOK.

17:22.345 --> 17:24.391
MA'AM, I DID NOT MEAN
TO OFFEND.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.610
IF YOU LET ME EXPLAIN
MY PROCEDURE TO YOU...

17:26.610 --> 17:29.439
[whirring]

17:35.793 --> 17:38.448
FERNANDA WAS A SWEETHEART,
HARD WORKER,

17:38.448 --> 17:41.277
HAD GOTTEN PRETTY SICK
A COUPLE OF WEEKS BACK,

17:41.277 --> 17:44.324
BUT THERE SHE WAS,
ON THE JOB.

17:44.324 --> 17:45.499
SICK HOW?

17:45.499 --> 17:46.848
STOMACH BUG, SOMETHING.

17:46.848 --> 17:49.068
DEDICATED.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.765
ABSOLUTELY.

17:50.765 --> 17:54.073
SHY AT FIRST, BUT THEN
SHE REALLY GOT INTO IT,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.031
ASKING HOW WE DID THINGS,
YOU KNOW,

17:56.031 --> 17:58.642
JUST LEARNING THE PROCESS.

17:58.642 --> 18:01.341
CAN I, UM, TRY
ONE OF THESE SODAS?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.734
ABSOLUTELY.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.606
[fizzes]

18:05.606 --> 18:08.043
CHEERS.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.436
MMM!

18:09.436 --> 18:11.568
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

18:11.568 --> 18:14.658
WHAT'S, UH, WHAT'S HAPPENING
TOMORROW NIGHT?

18:14.658 --> 18:16.660
THEY'RE HAVING
A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL

18:16.660 --> 18:18.271
FOR FERNANDA.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.621
MM.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.276
IS THE HELIOS STREET LINE
DIFFICULT TO GET TO?

18:23.276 --> 18:25.408
NO. BUS STOP
IS RIGHT OUT FRONT.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.022
[sighs]

18:31.022 --> 18:32.633
HEY!

18:32.633 --> 18:35.244
HEY, UH, LISBON'S JUST
FINISHING UP IN THERE.

18:35.244 --> 18:36.637
WON'T BE A MOMENT.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.508
WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT?

18:38.508 --> 18:41.468
VARIOUS THINGS.
ALL DATA IS USEFUL DATA.

18:41.468 --> 18:42.817
SO NOTHING THEN?

18:42.817 --> 18:44.514
AND YOU?

18:44.514 --> 18:48.475
WELL, I FOUND OUT HOW
OUR TWO VICTIMS WERE CONNECTED.

18:48.475 --> 18:49.606
HOW?

18:49.606 --> 18:51.608
GET ON THE BUS.
I'LL SHOW YOU.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.610
WAIT. BUT MY CAR IS--

18:53.610 --> 18:56.222
NAH, JUST GET ON THE BUS.
COME ON.

18:56.222 --> 18:59.399
[engine revving]

19:00.922 --> 19:03.185
YOU HAD
A LATE NIGHT CONVERSATION

19:03.185 --> 19:05.579
WITH VALERIE BESTIN
THE DAY BEFORE SHE DIED.

19:05.579 --> 19:08.538
YOU SAY YOU HARDLY KNEW HER,
AND THERE YOU ARE

19:08.538 --> 19:11.454
CALLING HER AT MIDNIGHT.
WHY'D YOU LIE?

19:11.454 --> 19:14.109
[Treadlow]
HOW IT LOOKS IS BAD,

19:14.109 --> 19:16.067
BUT IT WAS SHELTER BUSINESS.

19:16.067 --> 19:17.852
YOUR WIFE CAN CONFIRM THAT.

19:17.852 --> 19:19.462
THAT'S NOT NECESSARY.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.161
THEN TELL US
ABOUT THOSE CALLS.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.511
[scoffs] VALERIE WAS ALWAYS
THINKING SHE SAW ME

19:24.511 --> 19:27.470
BEING TOO FRIENDLY
WITH OUR FEMALE GUESTS.

19:27.470 --> 19:29.429
WHAT DIDSHE SEE?

19:29.429 --> 19:31.692
ME COMFORTING THEM.

19:31.692 --> 19:34.347
NEVER DISCOUNT THE POWER
OF HEALING TOUCH.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.698
SO HOW OFTEN ARE YOU HEALING
THE HOMELESS WOMEN AROUND HERE?

19:37.698 --> 19:41.484
DON'T MAKE IT SOUND SO SORDID.IF THERE WERE NOTHING WRONG,

19:41.484 --> 19:44.531
YOUR WIFE WOULD BE
STANDING HERE.LOOK... VALERIE KEPT YAMMERING

19:44.531 --> 19:47.490
ABOUT HOW SHE WAS GONNA TELL
MY WIFE IF I DIDN'T.

19:47.490 --> 19:49.492
SO I WAS TRYING TO PERSUADE HER

19:49.492 --> 19:51.494
TO LET ME HANDLE IT
IN MY OWN WAY.

19:51.494 --> 19:53.496
WE'VE LOOKED INTO YOU,
MR. TREADLOW.

19:53.496 --> 19:56.195
YOU AND YOUR WIFE STARTED
RUNNING THIS SHELTER

19:56.195 --> 19:57.587
NINE MONTHS AGO?

19:57.587 --> 20:00.286
YES, WHEN WE MOVED TO THE AREA.

20:00.286 --> 20:03.289
BUT THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
YOU LIVED AROUND HERE.

20:03.289 --> 20:07.206
YOU WORKED CONSTRUCTION HERE.
TEN YEARS AGO, RIGHT?I DID.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.470
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?WELL, YOU LEFT TOWN
IN THE MIDDLE OF A HOUSING BOOM,

20:10.470 --> 20:13.081
JUST AFTER A SERIAL KILLER
NAMED "THE CAVEMAN"

20:13.081 --> 20:15.997
STOPPED MURDERING
THE LOCAL WOMEN.AND NOW YOU'RE BACK,
AND HERE'S THE CAVEMAN AGAIN.

20:15.997 --> 20:17.868
CRAZY, RIGHT?

20:17.868 --> 20:19.348
COME ON.

20:19.348 --> 20:21.655
YOU NEED TO COME
WITH US.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.613
PLEASE.

20:33.884 --> 20:38.324
NOW THAT, UH... BROOCH
THAT YOU WEAR ALL THE TIME--

20:38.324 --> 20:41.892
DOES IT CARRY ANY SPECIAL
MEANING OR SIGNIFICANCE?

20:41.892 --> 20:43.198
NO.NO?

20:43.198 --> 20:45.331
I ONLY OWN ONE PIECE
OF JEWELRY.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.289
SAVES TIME
AND MENTAL ENERGY.

20:47.289 --> 20:50.379
THAT'S VERY EFFICIENT.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.642
LUCKY IT LOOKS
VERY GOOD ON YOU.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.601
THANK YOU.

21:00.737 --> 21:02.130
[brakes hiss]

21:02.130 --> 21:03.784
THAT'S AGILE TURTLE.

21:03.784 --> 21:06.395
SO THE OFFICE WHERE
VALERIE BESTIN WORKED

21:06.395 --> 21:08.745
IS ON THE SAME BUS ROUTE
AS THE FACTORY

21:08.745 --> 21:10.834
WHERE FERNANDA TALAN WORKED.

21:10.834 --> 21:13.489
THE HOMELESS SHELTER'S
ON THE SAME LINE, TOO.

21:13.489 --> 21:17.319
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S--THAT'S
A VERY SUGGESTIVE LINK, BUT--

21:17.319 --> 21:19.713
LISBON? YES, I DITCHED YOU.
UH, I MUST CONFESS.

21:19.713 --> 21:23.499
BUT LOOK AT THE BRIGHT SIDE.
I LEFT YOU WITH A CAR THIS TIME.

21:23.499 --> 21:26.067
THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE SO GRUMPY. IT'S OKAY.

21:26.067 --> 21:27.503
I CALL BEARING NEWS.

21:27.503 --> 21:30.593
OUR VICTIMS MET
ON THE HELIOS LINE.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.508
IT'S A BUS ROUTE.

21:32.508 --> 21:34.162
A BUS.

21:34.162 --> 21:36.556
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
YES.

21:36.556 --> 21:39.820
AND I WOULD BET THAT
THE KILLER MET THE VICTIMS

21:39.820 --> 21:42.431
ON THIS SAME BUS.

21:42.431 --> 21:44.477
MM-HMM.

21:44.477 --> 21:47.436
WELL...
IT'S ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.482
OKAY. BYE-BYE.

21:49.482 --> 21:51.005
PURE SURMISE.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.615
YES.

21:52.615 --> 21:55.531
PURE.

21:55.531 --> 21:59.535
ANYTHING ON THE JANE BUS ANGLE?I FOUND OUT VALERIE BESTIN
BARELY USED HER CAR

21:59.535 --> 22:01.885
EVEN THOUGH SHE GOT
HER LICENSE BACK A YEAR AGO.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.540
SHE MAINLY TOOK THE BUS,
JUST LIKE FERNANDA.

22:04.540 --> 22:07.326
CHO, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE WITH TREADLOW.WE'RE LETTING HIM THINK A WHILE.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.502
I'M WORKING
WITH THE D.A.'s OFFICE

22:09.502 --> 22:13.027
TO GET ALL THE PERSONNEL FILES
RELEASED BY THE BUS COMPANY.VAN PELT?

22:13.027 --> 22:15.421
I'M RUNNING FILTERS ON ALL
THE RIDERS WITH BUS PASSES

22:15.421 --> 22:18.032
TO SEE IF ANYTHING FLAGS.
NOTHING AS OF YET.

22:18.032 --> 22:21.252
OKAY, AND WHEN YOU'RE DONE
WITH THAT, FIND MY OLD COUCH.

22:27.781 --> 22:31.959
[brakes hiss]

22:31.959 --> 22:33.526
[doors open]

22:35.832 --> 22:39.836
[coins clatter]

22:46.408 --> 22:48.454
[brakes hiss]

22:48.454 --> 22:51.457
I DON'T RECALL THERE BEING
A STRONG CORRELATION

22:51.457 --> 22:54.460
BETWEEN THE VICTIMS AND THE USE
OF PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.376
THE CAVEMAN'S ADAPTING.
I'LL NEED TO UPDATE MY MODEL.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.378
MS. MONTAGUE, JUST--DOCTOR. DR.MONTAGUE.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.336
DR. MS. MONTAGUE.JUST DOCTOR.

23:01.336 --> 23:02.511
DOCTOR?YES.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.078
MONTAGUE.MM-HMM.

23:04.078 --> 23:06.080
TURN THE SUPER COMPUTER OFF.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.082
SIT BACK, RELAX,
AND ENJOY THE RIDE...

23:08.082 --> 23:10.084
AND THE COMPANY,
IF POSSIBLE.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.086
MR.JANE.YES. GOT IT IN ONE.

23:12.086 --> 23:14.088
YES. ON A NOTION...MM-HMM.

23:14.088 --> 23:17.265
YOU HAVE US SITTING ON A BUS
BECAUSE OUR VICTIMS

23:17.265 --> 23:19.833
MIGHTHAVE BEEN ON THE BUS
AT THE SAME TIME?

23:19.833 --> 23:21.791
THIS IS... MESSY.

23:21.791 --> 23:25.795
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION
AS PROFESSIONALS?

23:25.795 --> 23:28.450
TWO PROFESSIONALS--
PEERS, IF YOU WILL.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.800
WHY CAN'T A NOTION,
A THOUGHT, OR AN IDEA

23:30.800 --> 23:32.802
JUST HANG OUT THERE
FOR A MOMENT?

23:32.802 --> 23:35.065
JUST HANG.

23:35.065 --> 23:37.067
BECAUSE LIFE IS ORDER
AND SEQUENCE.

23:37.067 --> 23:38.460
DEATH IS DISORDER, ENTROPY.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.419
MM.

23:40.419 --> 23:42.464
DID YOU KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA

23:42.464 --> 23:45.511
LEADS THE NUMBER OF
SERIAL KILLERS IN THE NATION?

23:45.511 --> 23:48.514
JOB SECURITY, AT LEAST.
EXCUSE ME.

23:48.514 --> 23:50.907
PARDON ME, MA'AM.
UH, I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

23:50.907 --> 23:53.562

23:53.562 --> 23:56.478
DID YOU KNIT THIS YOURSELF?YES, I DID.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.524
THAT'S VERY NICE.
YOU KNOW, YOU COULD SELL THESE.

23:58.524 --> 24:01.135
DO YOU--DO YOU--HAVE YOU
THOUGHT OF SELLING THESE?

24:01.135 --> 24:02.963
YEAH. YOU--YOU WANT TO LOOK?

24:02.963 --> 24:05.879
IF YOU DON'T MIND.
THEY'RE VERY NICE.

24:05.879 --> 24:08.795
SHE'S GOT SOME GREAT STUFF HERE.
BEAUTIFUL.

24:08.795 --> 24:11.450
OH, THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.
CAN I JUST TRY THIS

24:11.450 --> 24:14.017
ON MY... LADY FRIEND?

24:14.017 --> 24:16.846
LOOK AT THIS. LOOK AT THAT.
IT'S A VERY SIMILAR STYLE...

24:16.846 --> 24:18.021
STOP.

24:18.021 --> 24:20.546
TO THE ONE
THAT FERNANDA WAS WEARING,

24:20.546 --> 24:23.592
AND IT LOOKS JUST TERRIFIC
WITH HER ENSEMBLE, NO? YES.

24:23.592 --> 24:28.249
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM. HELLO.
WE'RE INVESTIGATING THE MURDER--

24:28.249 --> 24:30.425
I'M SO SORRY. NO UNDERSTAND.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.906
IF I COULD JUST ASK YOU--NO UNDERSTAND.

24:32.906 --> 24:35.517
BUT IF YOU COULD JUST WAIT
A SECOND, I...

24:35.517 --> 24:36.910
EXCELLENT PEOPLE SKILLS.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.434
THAT'S SARCASM.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.480
UH-HUH.

24:41.480 --> 24:44.395
WE CAN WORK ON THAT.

24:44.395 --> 24:46.789
[indistinct conversations
in distance]

24:46.789 --> 24:48.225
HEY.

24:48.225 --> 24:50.619
HEY. I WAS GOING
THROUGH THE PERSONNEL FILES

24:50.619 --> 24:53.840
FOR THE BUS DRIVERS,
AND SOMETHING FLAGGED.

24:53.840 --> 24:56.451
A BUS DRIVER--
HIS NAME IS RALPH MERCER.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.453
HE'S ONLY BEEN
WITH THE BUS COMPANY

24:58.453 --> 25:00.629
FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS.SO?

25:00.629 --> 25:02.588
ACCORDING TO
HIS SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER,

25:02.588 --> 25:04.894
HE'S BEEN DEAD 15 YEARS.

25:04.894 --> 25:08.245
SO I DID A LITTLE MORE DIGGING,
AND FINGERPRINT RECORDS SAY

25:08.245 --> 25:10.378
MERCER IS ACTUALLY
ARTHUR COFFEY.

25:10.378 --> 25:13.686
NOT A NICE GUY--LONG SHEET,
INCLUDING AGGRAVATED RAPE

25:13.686 --> 25:15.775
AND ASSAULT
WITH A DEADLY WEAPON.

25:15.775 --> 25:19.039
HE DRIVES THE SAME ROUTE
OUR VICTIMS RODE?AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHIFTS.

25:19.039 --> 25:22.085
GREAT. WHERE IS HE NOW?GOT HIS ROUTE SCHEDULE
FROM HIS BOSS.

25:22.085 --> 25:23.739
HE'S ON THE ROAD NOW.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.221
[clears throat]

25:27.221 --> 25:29.266
HELLO, EVERYBODY. I'M PATRICK.

25:29.266 --> 25:31.268

FOUND MURDERED. YES?

25:34.750 --> 25:36.404
YES.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.406
FERNANDA TALAN
AND VALERIE BESTIN--

25:38.406 --> 25:40.408
THEY RODE THIS BUS EVERY DAY.

25:40.408 --> 25:43.672
YES, THEY DID, AND WE--
WHEN I SAY "WE,"

25:43.672 --> 25:47.110
I INCLUDE
MY CHARMING ASSOCIATE,

25:47.110 --> 25:48.590
DR. MONTAGUE.

25:48.590 --> 25:51.375
WE WANNA KNOW WHAT YOU KNOW
ABOUT THEM...

25:51.375 --> 25:53.290
AND ANY OTHER SHADY PEOPLE

25:53.290 --> 25:56.467
THAT YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED
ON THE BUS.

25:56.467 --> 25:58.469
ANY INFORMATION
MAY BE IMPORTANT.

25:58.469 --> 26:03.953
ANY LITTLEPIECE
OF INFORMATION MAY...

26:03.953 --> 26:06.739
BE IMPORTANT.

26:08.741 --> 26:11.178
ANYTHING AT ALL?

26:11.178 --> 26:14.573
ANY DETAIL?

26:14.573 --> 26:16.096

AH, SARCASM. THAT'S VERY GOOD.
YOU'RE LEARNING.

26:29.152 --> 26:32.068
BUT, UH, I, IN FACT,
GOT AN EXCELLENT RESPONSE.

26:32.068 --> 26:34.418
I'M TOLD THAT THE DRIVER
IS A LITTLE SHADY.

26:34.418 --> 26:36.029
REALLY?

26:36.029 --> 26:37.465
YES, REALLY.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.341
[Montague] HOW DID YOU...

26:57.398 --> 26:59.400
WHY ARE YOU GUYS
FOLLOWING ME?

26:59.400 --> 27:01.445
UH, WE'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS.

27:01.445 --> 27:03.360
ARE YOU COPS, OR...

27:03.360 --> 27:05.406
NO, WE'RE CONSULTANTS
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

27:05.406 --> 27:08.670
UH-HUH.ACTUALLY, NO,
SHE'S WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.716
I'M JUST AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

27:10.716 --> 27:13.457
SHE LURED ME
INTO THIS WHOLE MESS.HE'S GETTING AWAY.

27:13.457 --> 27:15.503
DO, UH, DO SOMETHING.THAT'S GOOD. LIKE WHAT?
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

27:15.503 --> 27:16.765
[tires screech]

27:16.765 --> 27:18.593
DROP THE WEAPON!

27:18.593 --> 27:20.551
FACEDOWN TO THE GROUND NOW!

27:22.336 --> 27:24.294
THAT'S NICE TIMING.

27:24.294 --> 27:28.342
DARN! WITH HIM IN THE BACK,
THERE WON'T BE ROOM FOR YOU TWO.

27:28.342 --> 27:31.345
WELL, HOW ARE WE GONNA GET BACK?TAKE THE BUS.

27:34.957 --> 27:37.960
HEWAS OUR DRIVER.

27:42.312 --> 27:44.358
CARJACKING, EXTORTION,
RAPE.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.665
NOW THAT WE'VE FOUND
30 BINDLES ON YOU,

27:46.665 --> 27:50.277
WE CAN ADD DEALING AS WELL.I WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT,
OKAY?

27:50.277 --> 27:52.279
I GOT A DISEASE...
CALLED ADDICTION.

27:52.279 --> 27:55.804
THAT'S ALL IT IS--
THE DEALING.

27:55.804 --> 27:57.763
I'M JUST TRYING TO,
YOU KNOW,

27:57.763 --> 27:59.852
MAINTAIN.

27:59.852 --> 28:02.985
[sighs] I'M A GOOD PERSON
THAT MADE SOME WRONG CHOICES.

28:02.985 --> 28:06.293
ARE YOU THE FIRSTBORN
IN YOUR FAMILY, MR. COFFEY?

28:06.293 --> 28:07.947
YEAH.

28:07.947 --> 28:10.427
EVER HEARD OF THE CAVEMAN?

28:10.427 --> 28:12.429

28:12.429 --> 28:13.996
YOU KNOW THESE WOMEN?

28:13.996 --> 28:16.390
YEAH.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.348
THEY RODE THE BUS.

28:18.348 --> 28:20.350
THEY WERE KILLED
BY THE CAVEMAN.

28:20.350 --> 28:23.919
I MEAN, IT WAS JUST ON TV.

28:23.919 --> 28:26.661
IN FACT, YEAH, IT WAS YOU
THAT WAS ON TV,

28:26.661 --> 28:28.532
SAID IT WAS THE CAVEMAN,
RIGHT?

28:28.532 --> 28:29.838
YEAH.[chuckles]

28:29.838 --> 28:32.798
HOW MANY SEXUAL PARTNERS
HAVE YOU HAD?

28:32.798 --> 28:37.716
WOW. YOU LIKE
TO CUT TO THE CHASE.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.327
UM... LIKE 100, 150.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.416
WOMEN? MEN?

28:42.416 --> 28:45.332
HELLO.WOMEN.
WHAT IS YOUR POINT HERE?

28:45.332 --> 28:47.638
WE NEED TO KNOW WHETHER
YOU KILLED THESE WOMEN

28:47.638 --> 28:50.337
BECAUSE THEY FOUND OUT
ABOUT YOUR SIDE BUSINESS

28:50.337 --> 28:52.905
OR BECAUSE
YOU'RE THE CAVEMAN.

28:52.905 --> 28:54.994
HEY. NO. YOU THINK
I'M THE CAVEMAN?

28:54.994 --> 28:57.344
NO, NO. YOU GOT ME
ALL WRONG HERE.

28:57.344 --> 29:01.261
I DEAL A LITTLE BLOW, OKAY?
I MEAN, I DON'T DO MURDERS.

29:04.351 --> 29:06.309
I THINK I'LL TAKE
A LAWYER NOW.

29:06.309 --> 29:08.703
MEH.

29:08.703 --> 29:10.661
WELL, HE'S THE ONLY SUSPECT
WE HAVE

29:10.661 --> 29:12.663
WITH A DIRECT LINK
TO BOTH VICTIMS.

29:12.663 --> 29:16.842
YES, IT'S ALL VERY COMPELLING,
BUT I'M NOT CONVINCED.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.757
AND, YES, YOU SHOULD.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.671
SHOULD WHAT?

29:20.671 --> 29:22.412
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT.

29:22.412 --> 29:24.371
NO.OH, YES, YOU DO.

29:24.371 --> 29:25.764
NO, I DON'T.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.374
YES, YOU DO.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.463
[blinds rattle]

29:31.247 --> 29:34.120
THAT BUS DRIVER'S AN ASS,
BUT HE ISN'T THE CAVEMAN.

29:34.120 --> 29:36.165
I'M THINKING THE SAME THING.

29:36.165 --> 29:38.559
HIS SHIFTS AT WORK DON'T
MATCH UP WITH OUR TIMELINE.

29:38.559 --> 29:41.605
AND WITHOUT ANY HARD EVIDENCE,
I HAD TO CUT TREADLOW LOOSE,

29:41.605 --> 29:45.914
SO WE HAVE TO START
FROM SCRATCH. DAMN IT TO HELL!OH, LANGUAGE. PLEASE.

29:45.914 --> 29:48.525
BERTRAM IS ON HIGHTOWER'S BACK.
SHE'S ON MINE.

29:48.525 --> 29:50.876
IT'S ALL, "CATCH THE CAVEMAN,
CATCH THE CAVEMAN."

29:50.876 --> 29:53.052
I HATE SERIAL KILLERS.

29:53.052 --> 29:56.446
CAVEMAN DIDN'T KILL
FERNANDA AND VALERIE. TRUST ME.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.797
WELL, HOW CAN YOU BE
SO SURE?

29:58.797 --> 30:01.800
[lowers voice] BECAUSE I WROTE
THE LETTER FROM THE CAVEMAN.

30:06.892 --> 30:08.719
[blinds rattle]

30:08.719 --> 30:12.723
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?I WROTE THE LETTER
FROM THE CAVEMAN.

30:12.723 --> 30:15.422
YEAH, I HEARD YOU
THE FIRST TIME.WHY'D YOU ASK ME
TO SAY IT AGAIN?

30:15.422 --> 30:17.119
IT WAS A RHETORICAL QUESTION!

30:17.119 --> 30:19.165
I JUST WANTED
TO STIR THINGS UP,

30:19.165 --> 30:21.471
JUST, YOU KNOW, GIVE MONTAGUE
A LITTLE PROD.I GET IT. SHE IRKS YOU.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.778
NO, SHE DOESN'T IRK ME.
I LIKE HER.

30:23.778 --> 30:26.737
IN FACT, SHE AMUSES ME.YEAH, AND IN THE MEANTIME,
EVERYBODY IS FREAKING OUT

30:26.737 --> 30:30.002
BECAUSE THEY THINK THERE'S
A SERIAL KILLER ON THE LOOSE.

30:30.002 --> 30:32.569
WELL, THERE IS THAT,
BUT... THAT WAS HER STORY.

30:32.569 --> 30:34.789
SHE MADE THAT UP, NOT ME.

30:34.789 --> 30:37.531
UNDOING THIS
IS GONNA BE A NIGHTMARE.[mouths words]

30:37.531 --> 30:40.273
THE PRESS IS GONNA HAVE
A FIELD DAY.

30:40.273 --> 30:43.058
I HAVE TO TELL THE FAMILIES.ISN'T THERE A CANDLELIGHT VIGIL
SOMEWHERE THIS EVENING?

30:43.058 --> 30:44.930
WELL, I THINK SO.

30:44.930 --> 30:48.542
IT'S ALL GONNA WORK OUT
JUST FINE.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.805
I HAVE... NO DOUBT
IN MY MIND.

30:57.333 --> 30:58.595
DR. MONTAGUE.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.206
AGENT RIGSBY.

31:02.121 --> 31:05.167
INTERESTING LINE OF QUESTIONING
YOU HAD GOING IN INTERROGATION.

31:05.167 --> 31:07.517
OH, WELL, YES, AS YOU KNOW,

31:07.517 --> 31:09.955
SEXUAL PROMISCUITY
AND RISKY BEHAVIOR

31:09.955 --> 31:12.783
ARE RELIABLE INDICATORS
IN PSYCHOPATHY.UH, YES, YOU CAN LEARN A LOT
ABOUT A PERSON

31:12.783 --> 31:14.176
FROM THEIR SEXUAL HISTORY.

31:14.176 --> 31:16.222
I REMEMBER THERE WAS
THIS ONE TIME

31:16.222 --> 31:18.877
WE HAD THIS GUY IN CUSTODY,
AND HE HAD A...

31:18.877 --> 31:20.530
IT WAS A...

31:20.530 --> 31:24.273
IT'S AN INAPPROPRIATE STORY,
SEXUAL HISTORY-WISE.

31:24.273 --> 31:25.492
[inhales deeply]

31:25.492 --> 31:28.843
THIS HAS BEEN, UH, NICE.

31:28.843 --> 31:31.454
WHAT HAS BEEN NICE?TALKING WITH YOU.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.326
OH, WELL. YOU'RE WELCOME.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.675
AGENT RIGSBY.

31:34.675 --> 31:35.806
YES?

31:35.806 --> 31:36.938
YOUR TEA.

31:36.938 --> 31:40.159
YES. [chuckles] I...

31:40.159 --> 31:42.161
WILL TAKE THAT TO GO.
[chuckles]

31:42.161 --> 31:43.553
[chuckles]

31:43.553 --> 31:46.774
WHAT, UH, AGENT RIGSBY
WANTED TO SAY...

31:46.774 --> 31:49.820
WELL, HE--HE WANTED TO ASK YOU
OUT ON A DATE TONIGHT.

31:49.820 --> 31:53.737
OH. UH... UH...

31:53.737 --> 31:56.871
I WAS... GOING TO GO
TO THE CANDLELIGHT VIGIL--

31:56.871 --> 31:59.482
OH, I GOT--SEE, I PICKED
THAT THING UP. UM...

31:59.482 --> 32:01.832
[Rigsby mutters indistinctly]

32:01.832 --> 32:03.660
THIS IS FOR YOU.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.836
RIGSBY PICKED IT OUT.

32:05.836 --> 32:08.883
I DIDN'T. I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT'S IN THAT BOX.YOU DIDN'T...

32:08.883 --> 32:10.537
YES, HE DID.

32:10.537 --> 32:11.973
NO, I DIDN'T.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.627
UM... UM...

32:13.627 --> 32:15.368
WOW.

32:17.065 --> 32:18.849
THANKS FOR COMING OUT.

32:18.849 --> 32:21.461
UM, FERNANDA'S FAMILY
WAS KIND ENOUGH TO INCLUDE US

32:21.461 --> 32:23.245
IN THIS VIGIL BECAUSE

32:23.245 --> 32:26.205
WE'RE ALL WORKING
TOWARD THE SAME END.

32:26.205 --> 32:30.165
WE NEED TO SPEAK UP. WE CAN'T
LET A KILLER LIKE THE CAVEMAN

32:30.165 --> 32:32.907
HOLD OUR COMMUNITY HOSTAGE.

32:32.907 --> 32:36.737
DON'T LET FERNANDA AND VALERIE
DIE IN VAIN.

32:36.737 --> 32:40.349
UH, IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY, PLEASE COME FORWARD.

32:41.785 --> 32:43.744
GOOD EVENING.

32:43.744 --> 32:45.659
UH, EXCUSE ME.
MY NAME IS PATRICK JANE.

32:45.659 --> 32:48.705
UH, I OFFER MY CONDOLENCES.

32:48.705 --> 32:52.405
I'M A PART OF THE TEAM THAT WILL
BRING THIS KILLER TO JUSTICE.

32:52.405 --> 32:54.450
I DO HAVE SOME UNFORTUNATE NEWS.

32:54.450 --> 32:57.062
WE'VE JUST LEARNED
THAT THE LETTER WE BELIEVED

32:57.062 --> 33:00.543
TO BE FROM THE CAVEMAN IS,
IN FACT, A VERY CLEVER FORGERY.

33:00.543 --> 33:03.764
SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?BOTTOM LINE--WE'RE PRETTY SURE
THAT THE CAVEMAN

33:03.764 --> 33:06.332
DIDN'T KILL YOUR LOVED ONES.

33:06.332 --> 33:09.378
SOMEONE IS USING THE CAVEMAN
AS A FOIL.YOU ALL SAID IT WAS HIM ON TV.

33:09.378 --> 33:12.251
THE PROFILER LADY SAID
YOU WERE MAKING GOOD PROGRESS

33:12.251 --> 33:13.904
ON THE CASE.

33:13.904 --> 33:16.646
SHE MADE A MISTAKE.
I'M SORRY, BUT IT HAPPENS.

33:16.646 --> 33:18.648
SO DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

33:18.648 --> 33:21.651
AGAIN, I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE
PROFUSELY FOR OUR ERROR.

33:21.651 --> 33:26.743
UH... IT APPEARS THAT THIS,
UH, FORGER IS, UH,

33:26.743 --> 33:28.876
ONE OF UNPARALLELED SKILL.AAH!

33:28.876 --> 33:32.619
OHH!OH, MY GOD. THAT'S BLOOD.

33:34.925 --> 33:38.538
[Treadlow]
OHH. WHAT IS THAT?

33:38.538 --> 33:40.801
THE PROFILER LADY
WAS WEARING THAT.

33:40.801 --> 33:42.194
[Patrick] YES, SHE WAS.

33:44.935 --> 33:47.721
I'M NOT A SPECIALIST,
BUT THAT LOOKS LIKE A KIDNEY.

33:47.721 --> 33:50.593
THERE'S A NOTE.

33:50.593 --> 33:51.942
"YOUR PROFILER IS DEAD.

33:51.942 --> 33:55.120
STUPID COPYCAT WILL JOIN HER
AT MIDNIGHT."

33:55.120 --> 33:57.513
SIGNED FROM THE CAVEMAN.

33:57.513 --> 34:02.344
OH, NO.
LISBON, WHERE ARE YOU?

34:02.344 --> 34:04.303
I NEED YOUR HELP.

34:08.524 --> 34:10.396
LISTEN, THANKS FOR TONIGHT.
I HAD FUN.

34:10.396 --> 34:11.919
SO DID I, WAYNE.

34:11.919 --> 34:13.921
UM, I ENJOYED
YOUR FUNNY STORIES IMMENSELY.

34:13.921 --> 34:15.923
GOOD. AND I ENJOYED YOUR,
UH...

34:15.923 --> 34:19.013
WELL, I LEARNED A LOT
ABOUT STATISTICAL ANALYSIS.

34:19.013 --> 34:20.971
I HOPE I DIDN'T BORE YOU.

34:20.971 --> 34:22.364
NO, NOT AT ALL.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.759
UM, IN FACT, WOULD YOU
LIKE TO GO OUT AGAIN?

34:25.759 --> 34:27.456
I WOULD.

34:27.456 --> 34:29.502
UH... I WOULD. DO...

34:29.502 --> 34:32.679
YOU ARE AN ATTRACTIVE
AND STABLE CHARACTER.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.507
THANK YOU.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.900
BUT I DON'T NEED TO CONDUCT
AN ANALYSIS

34:36.900 --> 34:39.947
TO SEE THAT YOU'RE STILL
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

34:39.947 --> 34:42.471
THE PROBABILITY OF US HAVING
A SUCCESSFUL RELATIONSHIP

34:42.471 --> 34:44.995
IS NO MORE THAN 20%.

34:44.995 --> 34:46.432
20%?

34:46.432 --> 34:47.346
MM-HMM, TOPS.

34:49.348 --> 34:50.740
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

34:50.740 --> 34:53.221
I THOUGHT WE WERE
WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT.

34:53.221 --> 34:55.441
OH, HI. EVERYBODY'S OUT
CATCHING THE KILLER.

34:55.441 --> 34:56.529
SERIOUSLY?

34:56.529 --> 34:59.619
NO, I'M JOKING.OH.

34:59.619 --> 35:02.709
THAT WAS SARCASM. UH,
THEY'RE OUT CATCHING THE KILLER.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.411
NILDA,
WILL YOU HURRY UP?

35:09.411 --> 35:10.804
WHAT ABOUT CHUY?

35:10.804 --> 35:12.414
FORGET THE LIZARD ALREADY!

35:12.414 --> 35:14.286
ESSENTIAL ITEMS ONLY.

35:20.596 --> 35:21.989
[loud clank]

35:21.989 --> 35:23.947
¿QUé ES ESO?

35:23.947 --> 35:26.211
[loud clank][gasps and whimpers]

35:27.908 --> 35:30.040
[whispers] IT'S THE CAVEMAN.

35:30.040 --> 35:33.696
THIS IS ALL A BIG MISTAKE.[normal voice]
WE NEVER MEANT TO COPY YOU!

35:33.696 --> 35:36.569
WE JUST TOOK THE BODIES TO
THE FIRST PLACE WE THOUGHT OF.

35:36.569 --> 35:39.398
NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU,
I SWEAR.

35:39.398 --> 35:41.878
[Esther] WE HAD NO IDEA!PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!

35:43.576 --> 35:44.577
[switch clicks]

35:46.579 --> 35:47.971
[Velcro rips]

35:47.971 --> 35:48.972
BOO.

35:50.757 --> 35:54.021
I'M THINKING THIS HAS TO DO
WITH YOUR NATURAL SODA.

35:54.021 --> 35:56.806
SOMETHING NOT SO NATURAL IN IT?WELL, THAT'S NO SECRET.

35:56.806 --> 36:00.114
A LOT OF FOODS REQUIRE
ADDITIVES TO KEEP THEM FRESH.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.116
FERNANDA WAS GIVING HER FRIEND,
VALERIE BESTIN,

36:02.116 --> 36:05.424
CRATES OF SODA TO DISTRIBUTE
TO THE HOMELESS, RIGHT?

36:05.424 --> 36:07.948
YES.

36:07.948 --> 36:10.951
THEN A MAN AT THE SHELTER,
MARTIN BRENT, KNOWN AS MARTY,

36:10.951 --> 36:13.388
DIED AFTER DRINKING THE SODA,
RIGHT?

36:13.388 --> 36:16.609
I DON'T KNOW ANY MARTY.SURE YOU DO.

36:16.609 --> 36:20.221
I'M ONLY TELLING YOU THIS SO YOU
KNOW NOT TO TELL US STORIES.

36:20.221 --> 36:22.615
WHY WOULD I LIE ABOUT
KNOWING SOME HOMELESS GUY?

36:22.615 --> 36:24.660
THE ASSUMPTION
WAS THAT MARTY DIED

36:24.660 --> 36:27.663
BECAUSE HIS SYSTEM WAS TOO WEAK
TO FIGHT OFF THE FLU.

36:27.663 --> 36:31.014
BUT WHEN FERNANDA GOT SICK,
SHE STARTED TO DO SOME DIGGING.

36:31.014 --> 36:35.323
YOU CAN'T TIE ANY OF THAT
TO US.A SIMPLE BLOOD TEST WILL SHOW
JUST WHAT ADDITIVES

36:35.323 --> 36:37.282
WERE PRESENT IN HIS SYSTEM.
EVERYONE AT THE SHELTER CAN

36:37.282 --> 36:38.848
CONFIRM DRINKING THE SODAS.

36:38.848 --> 36:41.634
WHO GAVE THEM OUT
CAN BE TESTED AS WELL.

36:41.634 --> 36:47.466
ESTHER SAID THE SODA WAS
LOSING TOO MUCH FLAVOR

36:47.466 --> 36:50.295
SO WE STARTED USING GLYCOL
AS A STABILIZER.

36:50.295 --> 36:52.297
WE GOT A BAD BATCH.

36:52.297 --> 36:54.168
HOW BAD?

36:54.168 --> 36:57.171
ESTHER SAID YOU HAD TO DRINK
A LOT OF IT

36:57.171 --> 36:59.521
IN ORDER FOR THERE TO BE
ANY BAD EFFECTS.

36:59.521 --> 37:01.523
MOST PEOPLE JUST GOT
AN UPSET STOMACH.

37:01.523 --> 37:03.917
IT WAS ONLY LIKE
500 BOTTLES.

37:03.917 --> 37:07.442
YOU KNEW YOU WERE ENDANGERING
THE LIVES OF YOUR CONSUMERS.

37:07.442 --> 37:12.360
ESTHER SAID PULLING
THE PRODUCT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE

37:12.360 --> 37:15.189
AND KEPT SAYING
IT WAS NO BIG DEAL.

37:15.189 --> 37:17.670
WHO DRINKS 12 BOTTLES
IN ONE GO ANYWAY?

37:17.670 --> 37:21.674
RIGHT, AND THEN
THE HOMELESS MAN, MARTY, DIED.

37:21.674 --> 37:24.633
FERNANDA MADE THE CONNECTION,
STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS.

37:27.767 --> 37:30.378
FERNANDA WOULDN'T
LET IT GO,

37:30.378 --> 37:33.338
SAID WE HAD TO ISSUE
A MASSIVE RECALL.

37:33.338 --> 37:35.209
SHE'D TELL IF WE DIDN'T.

37:35.209 --> 37:37.603
AND THEN YOU KILLED
YOUR OWN COUSIN.

37:41.998 --> 37:43.783
[crying]

37:43.783 --> 37:46.089
YEAH, WE DID.

37:48.048 --> 37:49.441
[continues crying]

37:49.441 --> 37:52.052
AND THEN VALERIE SHOWED UP
A WEEK LATER,

37:52.052 --> 37:54.359
AND YOU KNEW
WHAT YOU HAD TO DO.

37:54.359 --> 37:56.535
[sniffles]

37:56.535 --> 38:00.582
I TOLD ESTHER. THAT LADY
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.585
[sniffles] BUT SHE KEPT
SAYING SOMEONE LIKE HER

38:03.585 --> 38:07.589
WOULDN'T STOP COMING AROUND
AND ASKING QUESTIONS.

38:07.589 --> 38:11.158
[sighs] SO SHE HAD TO GO.

38:11.158 --> 38:12.768
[crying]

38:12.768 --> 38:15.467
[Nilda]
FERNANDA WAS MY PRIMA.

38:15.467 --> 38:19.384
SHE WAS SUPPOSED TO STICK UP
FOR HER OWN.

38:19.384 --> 38:21.342
BUT SHE CHOSE
THAT BITCH ON THE BUS

38:21.342 --> 38:23.736
OVER HER FAMILY.

38:23.736 --> 38:26.521
[continues crying]

38:34.747 --> 38:36.096
[zips bag]

38:53.505 --> 38:55.158
[sighs]

38:55.158 --> 38:59.075
THANK YOU, MAN.
I APPRECIATE IT. REALLY.

38:59.075 --> 39:00.468
IT'S JUST SODA.

39:00.468 --> 39:02.078
IT'S DIET, RIGHT?

39:02.078 --> 39:03.166
YEP.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.385
[both slurping]

39:06.126 --> 39:06.909
MR. JANE?

39:06.909 --> 39:08.433
MS. MONTAGUE.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.739
WE HAVE SOME IMPORTANT BUSINESS
TO CONCLUDE.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.306
WE DO?

39:16.397 --> 39:17.659
FOR YOU.

39:17.659 --> 39:20.270
AH.I--

39:20.270 --> 39:22.664
HANG ON.[chuckles]

39:22.664 --> 39:25.101
MM-HMM.
YEAH, THAT'S GOOD.

39:25.101 --> 39:27.103
OKAY?THANK YOU.

39:27.103 --> 39:29.105
I ALWAYS SETTLE MY DEBTS.

39:29.105 --> 39:32.239
YOU WERE RIGHT.
THAT WASN'T A SERIAL KILLER.

39:32.239 --> 39:35.808
MM. YOU REMIND ME.
I ALMOST FORGOT.

39:35.808 --> 39:38.288
THANK YOU.
FORGOTTEN IT, TOO.

39:38.288 --> 39:40.552
USEFUL BROOCH. UM, AND I--

39:40.552 --> 39:43.163
I WAS HOPING THAT, YOU KNOW,
YOU MIGHT FORGIVE ME

39:43.163 --> 39:45.208
ANY MISDIRECTION
I MIGHT HAVE GIVEN YOU.

39:45.208 --> 39:46.601
OH, YES. NO.

39:46.601 --> 39:50.257
NO, I-I...
ACTUALLY, IT WAS BRACING

39:50.257 --> 39:52.781
TO HAVE ONE'S
OPERATING PRINCIPLES CHALLENGED

39:52.781 --> 39:54.348
SO... ROBUSTLY.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.394
GLAD TO BE OF SERVICE.

39:56.394 --> 39:58.613
YOU KNOW,
I'VE NEVER PARTICIPATED

39:58.613 --> 40:00.267
IN CHICANERY BEFORE.

40:00.267 --> 40:02.269
I CAN'T CONDONE IT
AS A SYSTEM,

40:02.269 --> 40:05.315
BUT I MUST ADMIT THAT IT ADDS...
ZEST TO THE TASK AT HAND.

40:05.315 --> 40:06.360
[chuckles]

40:06.360 --> 40:08.449
IN FACT, W--

40:12.888 --> 40:17.197
HOW DID YOU FIGURE IT OUT,
THAT IT WAS ESTHER AND NILDA?

40:19.504 --> 40:21.331
JUST A GOOD GUESS.

40:21.331 --> 40:23.421
WHEN WE FIRST WITH THEM,

40:23.421 --> 40:27.642
THEY WERE MASKING SHAME,
NOT SADNESS.

40:27.642 --> 40:30.340
AND WHO LIKES LIZARDS?
COLD-BLOODED PEOPLE.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.733
LIZARDS.

40:31.733 --> 40:34.388
I THINK I SHALL STICK
WITH HARD NUMBERS.

40:34.388 --> 40:36.390
I HAVE ANOTHER GUESS
FOR YOU.

40:36.390 --> 40:38.348
THE CAVEMAN ISN'T
COMING BACK.

40:38.348 --> 40:40.481
HE IS ALMOST CERTAINLY DEAD.

40:40.481 --> 40:43.571
POSSIBLY. I HAVE NO
PERSONAL BIAS ON THE MATTER.

40:43.571 --> 40:46.661
THE NUMBERS WILL EVENTUALLY
REVEAL THE TRUTH EITHER WAY.

40:46.661 --> 40:48.228
THEY ALWAYS DO.

40:48.228 --> 40:49.708
YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT?

40:49.708 --> 40:52.319
OF COURSE. IF YOU COULD
STAND FAR ENOUGH BACK

40:52.319 --> 40:56.802
TO SEE THE BIG PICTURE,
EVERYTHING IS NUMBERS.

40:56.802 --> 40:58.543
SPEAKING OF WHICH...

40:58.543 --> 41:01.502
YOU GAVE ME A GIFT,
SO I MUST GIVE YOU ONE.

41:01.502 --> 41:04.853
I RAN RED JOHN
THROUGH THE MODELING PROGRAM.

41:04.853 --> 41:07.682
YOU MIGHT FIND SOME
OF THE DATA SETS USEFUL.

41:07.682 --> 41:12.731
HMM. WOW. LOT OF FIGURES
AND GRAPHS HERE.

41:12.731 --> 41:14.123
THAT'S RIGHT.

41:14.123 --> 41:15.211
HMM.

41:19.389 --> 41:21.304
GOOD LUCK.

41:22.741 --> 41:24.220
WELL, THANK YOU.
