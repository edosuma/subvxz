34:38.585 --> 34:41.007
Yo. What do we have here?

34:41.170 --> 34:42.547
SEAN: I want to introduce you to someone.

34:42.755 --> 34:45.009
Emily, this is Eddy, co-founder of The Mob.

34:45.091 --> 34:46.467
And my best friend.

34:46.551 --> 34:47.893
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

34:48.553 --> 34:49.554
What's she doing here?

34:50.097 --> 34:51.349
She's gonna join our next mission.

34:53.184 --> 34:56.108
I got her up to speed about the contest
and how things are going down.

34:56.187 --> 34:57.814
She can help.

34:57.897 --> 35:00.150
Sean, can I talk to you for a second?

35:04.069 --> 35:05.571
What the hell is this?

35:05.863 --> 35:07.035
She's an incredible dancer.

35:07.198 --> 35:09.951
So what? Just like that, she's inner circle?

35:10.409 --> 35:11.956
How do I know I can trust her?

35:12.036 --> 35:13.003
SEAN: Because I vouch for her.

35:13.078 --> 35:15.707
EDDY: No! We can only trust
the people that we have.

35:15.916 --> 35:16.963
What's the issue?

35:17.042 --> 35:20.888
We've been saying we need another girl
to really go off and hit choreography.

35:21.379 --> 35:24.633
It's worth a shot, right? She's actually good.

35:24.883 --> 35:26.100
Come on.

35:31.598 --> 35:33.646
Can you get her ready
in time for the next Mob?

35:34.893 --> 35:36.895
Yeah. I think so.

35:37.062 --> 35:39.657
Good. Because you're dancing lead.

35:41.192 --> 35:42.489
Did you say "lead"?

35:42.568 --> 35:43.660
Yeah, I did.

35:44.070 --> 35:45.162
(MAN WHISTLES)

35:46.906 --> 35:48.453
- It's going to be good.
- You'll be good.

35:51.244 --> 35:52.621
Let me introduce you to the crew.

35:53.663 --> 35:55.540
<i>Eddy is our resident Mark Zuckerberg.</i>

35:55.623 --> 35:58.251
<i>Anything electronic
or computer-related, he can do.</i>

35:58.334 --> 35:59.551
<i>He's our eyes and ears.</i>

36:03.590 --> 36:05.843
<i>Penelope is the hottest DJ on South Beach.</i>

36:05.926 --> 36:08.270
<i>She creates all the mind-blowing remixes
for our Mobs.</i>

36:08.762 --> 36:10.309
<i>She sets everything in motion.</i>

36:13.100 --> 36:15.194
<i>And Jason just got back from New York</i>

36:15.269 --> 36:17.271
<i>where he was a pan' of this
crew called The Pirates.</i>

36:17.437 --> 36:20.441
<i>Anything we need in terms of effects,
he's our boy.</i>

36:23.193 --> 36:25.616
<i>Mercury is a locally renowned street artist.</i>

36:25.696 --> 36:28.576
<i>No one, I mean no one,
has ever heard mm speak.</i>

36:28.992 --> 36:31.165
<i>You know, "Picture's worth
a thousand words" thing.</i>

36:31.953 --> 36:34.001
<i>Iris was huge in the SoCal skate scene.</i>

36:34.080 --> 36:35.753
<i>He wanted to put his lens
on something next-level,</i>

36:35.832 --> 36:37.675
<i>so we gave him something to film.</i>

36:38.167 --> 36:40.670
<i>Sly and Adrian are leaders
of our parkour crew.</i>

36:41.004 --> 36:42.722
<i>They handle all of our stunts.</i>

36:44.132 --> 36:46.681
<i>The rest of our crew,
they're from all over the world,</i>

36:46.759 --> 36:48.477
<i>and dance every style there is.</i>

36:48.636 --> 36:50.183
<i>And this is where we put it all together.</i>

36:50.305 --> 36:52.058
<i>It's the Batcave of The Mob.</i>

36:52.808 --> 36:55.186
<i>We wake people up out
of their daily lives, Emily.</i>

36:55.394 --> 36:57.988
<i>We hit them where and when
they least expect it.</i>

36:58.689 --> 37:01.943
<i>When The Mob speaks, everyone listens.</i>

37:03.068 --> 37:05.070
(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)

37:20.378 --> 37:22.301
You still have time to back out.

37:22.839 --> 37:24.182
SEAN: Nah, we're good.

37:25.508 --> 37:27.351
You are ready, right?

40:10.347 --> 40:11.815
(CROWD CHEERING)

40:23.026 --> 40:24.152
Mind if I cut in?

40:27.656 --> 40:28.828
Can you salsa?

40:29.575 --> 40:30.701
Can I.

40:30.827 --> 40:32.875
All right. Let's see if you can keep up.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.428
Come on. You've gotta give it up.

41:26.885 --> 41:29.013
You did good. You did.

41:29.762 --> 41:31.560
It was the best Mob yet.

41:33.391 --> 41:35.109
SEAN: This is great. Come on.

41:39.731 --> 41:41.278
EMILY: I like it here.

41:43.777 --> 41:45.324
It's not exactly Star Island.

41:45.404 --> 41:47.623
No, it's better. You're lucky.

41:49.658 --> 41:50.910
Lucky?

41:50.993 --> 41:52.836
I wish I grew up in a place like this.

41:54.788 --> 41:56.415
I grew up in hotels.

41:56.832 --> 41:59.631
All different, but all exactly the same.

41:59.793 --> 42:02.637
Clean, sterile, temporary.

42:04.590 --> 42:06.639
People actually live here.

42:08.803 --> 42:10.146
It's great.

42:12.015 --> 42:13.107
(CHUCKLING)

42:13.516 --> 42:14.733
It is.

42:15.310 --> 42:17.062
You want to see more of it?

42:22.776 --> 42:24.119
This is yours?

42:24.236 --> 42:25.658
How about I show you around?

42:48.010 --> 42:49.887
EMILY: So when did you start The Mob?

42:49.971 --> 42:53.271
SEAN: It was Eddy who came up
with the idea of doing Mobs.

42:53.849 --> 42:55.397
EMILY: How long have you known him?

42:55.519 --> 42:56.862
SEAN: All my life.

42:57.104 --> 42:59.106
We're more like brothers, I guess.

42:59.189 --> 43:03.569
Our folks would go to Ricky's every night
and we'd be there,

43:03.652 --> 43:06.531
these little kids, just wilding out.

43:13.412 --> 43:15.289
Then my pops took off.

43:16.873 --> 43:18.546
Moms met her new man

43:18.625 --> 43:21.675
and ever since then,
it's kind of been us against the world.

43:24.716 --> 43:26.514
That's what it was like for me, too.

43:26.718 --> 43:29.062
Me and my dad right after my mom split.

43:29.387 --> 43:31.264
We were inseparable.

43:32.682 --> 43:33.979
What happened?

43:37.061 --> 43:41.066
I got my own ideas
about what I wanted to do.

43:41.607 --> 43:43.359
You know'? With my life.

43:43.443 --> 43:46.539
And he's had a really hard time
accepting that.

43:48.574 --> 43:50.497
You should be able to do
what you want to do.

43:50.576 --> 43:52.419
It's not that simple.

43:53.203 --> 43:54.455
Why not?

43:55.122 --> 43:57.216
You don't understand, Sean.

43:57.750 --> 43:59.047
I wish I was like you.

43:59.126 --> 44:02.096
I could just do whatever I wanted.

44:02.296 --> 44:04.298
You know? Break the rules.

44:04.923 --> 44:06.345
Me?

44:06.425 --> 44:09.396
You've got to realize, guys like Eddy and I,

44:10.555 --> 44:12.557
we're invisible in this city.

44:14.476 --> 44:17.605
That's kind of how we came up
with the idea of doing Mobs.

44:19.439 --> 44:22.113
It's like us saying, "Listen up."

44:23.818 --> 44:26.321
"We exist. This city is ours, too."

44:30.450 --> 44:31.451
(LAUGHS)

44:34.330 --> 44:36.628
- Does that sound lame?
- No.

44:37.666 --> 44:38.918
Not at all.

45:32.306 --> 45:33.683
(BOAT HORN BLOWING)

45:54.997 --> 45:56.214
Hey, Ricky.

46:02.004 --> 46:03.096
What's wrong?

46:04.506 --> 46:07.225
Ever hear of Anderson Global Properties?

46:09.052 --> 46:10.350
Yeah. Why?

46:12.056 --> 46:13.433
This Anderson guy,

46:13.558 --> 46:15.936
he wants to build some sort of development.

46:16.561 --> 46:19.440
Luxury hotel. Designer shops.

46:19.564 --> 46:23.068
He's buying the whole strip
on this side of the river.

46:23.193 --> 46:24.820
This bar, your home,

46:24.903 --> 46:27.782
the shop where your sister works, all gone.

46:28.740 --> 46:30.458

46:30.700 --> 46:31.747
(SCOFFS)

46:32.535 --> 46:34.504
EDDY: Can you believe this?

46:34.580 --> 46:36.708
It's the same asshole that fired me.

46:38.667 --> 46:42.262
This guy can't walk in here
and take everything we have.

46:42.755 --> 46:43.881
(SIGHING)

46:44.423 --> 46:45.766
SEAN: Can't you just say no, Ricky?

46:45.883 --> 46:47.180
It's not my choice, <i>hi]'o</i>

46:47.259 --> 46:50.263
I'm like everyone around here. I rent.

46:54.266 --> 46:57.065
A lot of people are making
a living on this strip.

46:57.228 --> 47:00.574
And now everything's gonna be wiped out.
Gone.

47:11.117 --> 47:12.118
Emily!

47:14.579 --> 47:16.456
Hey! Where are you going?

47:16.540 --> 47:18.133
To talk to my dad.

47:18.250 --> 47:19.342
Is it gonna help?

47:19.417 --> 47:21.090
I don't know, but I have to try.

47:21.169 --> 47:22.716
We have to tell your friends
that he's my dad.

47:22.797 --> 47:23.798
They deserve that much.

47:23.923 --> 47:26.517
I don't know. Eddy almost lost it in there.

47:26.634 --> 47:28.011
And Ricky, I've never seen him like that.

47:29.136 --> 47:31.013
Right now, I think it might make it worse.

47:42.316 --> 47:44.569
You want to at least tell me
where you've been?

47:45.444 --> 47:47.948
I was out with a friend. It got late.

47:48.991 --> 47:50.493
So you spent the night with some guy?

47:50.659 --> 47:52.502
It wasn't like that.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.714
Just don't do it again. I've got a meeting.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.461
Are you planning to build in
the Spring Gardens district?

48:03.005 --> 48:04.552
Why do you ask?

48:08.468 --> 48:11.518
My friend, Sean. He lives there.

48:11.973 --> 48:13.691
This just keeps getting better.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.185
So you spent the night in a slum.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.191
- It is not a slum.
- Emily...

48:17.395 --> 48:19.068
Daddy, I wish you could see it.

48:19.188 --> 48:21.236
The same families
have lived there for decades.

48:21.316 --> 48:23.614
Every time I build,
something else gets knocked down.

48:23.693 --> 48:26.822

It's the price of progress.</i>

48:27.030 --> 48:28.953

Trip is meeting with the city council
next Thursday.

48:32.368 --> 48:35.463
And once they give it the okay,
we break ground at the end of the month.

48:35.538 --> 48:37.917
Please, don't do this.

48:38.500 --> 48:40.002
Let's make a deal.

48:40.127 --> 48:42.221
I won't tell you how to dance,

48:44.757 --> 48:46.509
and you don't tell me
how to run my company.

49:07.280 --> 49:08.406
Where are you?

49:08.531 --> 49:09.532
I'm right here.

49:09.699 --> 49:11.292
You're not here.

49:13.370 --> 49:14.838
I'm watching you,

49:14.913 --> 49:19.589
and it's like you're being
blown around the studio like a leaf.

49:25.716 --> 49:27.764
Take control, Emily.

49:30.262 --> 49:32.560
Let's take it from the top.

49:41.023 --> 49:42.024
Where have you been?

49:45.236 --> 49:47.284
Emily's got an idea for the next Mob.

49:49.491 --> 49:51.710
I really don't need Cinderella coming in here

49:51.785 --> 49:53.787
and messing with the program.

49:53.954 --> 49:56.048
We need to be working on the next Mob.

49:56.123 --> 49:57.545
We've already got over 4,000,000 hits.

49:57.624 --> 50:00.798
So you got a lot of hits on YouTube.
That's great.

50:01.670 --> 50:04.014
Maybe you'll win this thing,
and you'll win some money,

50:04.256 --> 50:07.430
but it's not gonna change anything.
Believe me.

50:10.303 --> 50:12.726
You have 4,000,000 people listening,

50:12.806 --> 50:15.481
but you're not saying anything
that actually matters.

50:15.685 --> 50:20.282
It's not okay to make art for fun anymore,
and it's not okay to make trouble either.

50:20.690 --> 50:21.987
So what are you proposing?

50:22.608 --> 50:25.077
I'm saying enough with performance art.

50:25.153 --> 50:27.201
It's time for protest art.

50:30.158 --> 50:32.126
Anderson Global Properties
is pitching the project

50:32.201 --> 50:33.748
to the city council in a week.

50:33.828 --> 50:37.173
They have to have the council's approval
to move forward, so...

50:37.583 --> 50:38.926
I think we should join them.

50:39.543 --> 50:41.341
So we're gonna mob the meeting?

50:43.464 --> 50:44.761
I'm down.

50:45.174 --> 50:46.175
How do you know all this?

50:49.845 --> 50:51.893
City council meetings are public record.

called the Internet now.

51:01.023 --> 51:02.025
SEAN: Think about it.

51:03.318 --> 51:06.743
Instead of just getting hits,
we can make a statement.

51:09.991 --> 51:12.915
I'm listening. What's the plan?

51:13.369 --> 51:17.590
Well, we're gonna need some more dancers.

one of the largest marketing firms in the U.S.

51:36.435 --> 51:40.440
Bob has agreed to personally oversee
the campaign for our new development.

51:40.898 --> 51:42.241
BOB: It's my pleasure.

51:42.399 --> 51:44.401
TRIP: He'll lay out
a detailed plan for us in a sec,

51:44.610 --> 51:49.081
but first I'd like to direct your attention
to our plan to renovate the riverside.

51:59.251 --> 52:01.925
Folks, we should probably step outside.

52:04.089 --> 52:06.057
Just file out. I'm sure it's nothing
to be too concerned about.

52:06.132 --> 52:07.930
I apologize for this.

52:08.134 --> 52:10.933
I don't know if it's a drill or not, but we'll get to the bottom of it.

52:11.096 --> 52:12.268
Follow me.

52:12.848 --> 52:15.193
We'll just do what they need us to do and get back up there.

01:30:24.690 --> 01:30:28.570
I hope you don't object,
but our biggest client is actually Nike.

01:30:29.654 --> 01:30:30.621
Yeah?

01:30:30.696 --> 01:30:31.913
They're looking for something different

01:30:31.989 --> 01:30:34.617
and a little more cutting edge
for their new campaign.

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.418
I think your crew is perfect.

01:30:36.702 --> 01:30:38.545
Ready to introduce The Mob to the world?

01:30:39.705 --> 01:30:40.831
What do you think?

01:30:41.207 --> 01:30:43.505
What do I think? Where do I sign?

01:30:43.626 --> 01:30:45.129
(ALL CHEERING)

01:31:03.605 --> 01:31:05.027
Look at what you did.

01:31:05.524 --> 01:31:07.572
You brought all these people together.

01:31:11.948 --> 01:31:15.543
You know, we could still use somebody
who knows how to break the rules.

01:31:17.245 --> 01:31:18.462
I'm in.
