WEBVTT

00:01.376 --> 00:04.094
The Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.

00:04.171 --> 00:07.141
Every single fact in the Empire
beams out of this place.

00:07.257 --> 00:08.804
Now, that's what I call power.

00:08.884 --> 00:12.514
Six hundred channels, all coming out of
Satellite Five, broadcasting everywhere.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.644
This technology's wrong.

00:16.058 --> 00:17.560
- Trouble?
- Oh, yeah.

00:17.643 --> 00:20.692
This is not the Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.

00:20.771 --> 00:25.026
It's a place where humans are allowed to
live by kind permission of my client.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.486
Who controls Satellite Five?

00:27.152 --> 00:30.907
The Mighty Jagrafess
of the Holy Hadrojassic Maxarodenfoe.

00:31.240 --> 00:33.834
You mean that thing's
in charge of Satellite Five?

00:33.909 --> 00:36.788
Once you go to Floor 500,
you never come back.

00:46.296 --> 00:49.015
You'll have to stay and explain it,
no one's going to believe me.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.932
They might start believing
a lot of things now.

00:50.968 --> 00:53.687
The human race should accelerate,
all back to normal.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.237
What's happening?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.322
Oh, my God!

01:13.532 --> 01:16.536
I don't believe it!
Why did they put you in there?

01:16.952 --> 01:18.579
They never said you were coming.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.289
What happened? I was...

01:20.914 --> 01:24.464
Careful now.
Ooh, mind yourself.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.671
That's the transmat,
it scrambles your head.

01:26.795 --> 01:29.969
I was sick for days.
All right?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.769
So, what's your name,
then, sweetheart?

01:34.845 --> 01:39.225
The Doctor, I think. I was...
I don't know. What happened?

01:39.391 --> 01:41.143
You got chosen.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.029
Chosen for what?

01:44.146 --> 01:47.241
You're a housemate!
You're in the house. Isn't that brilliant?

01:47.357 --> 01:51.157
That's not fair,
we've got eviction in five minutes!

01:51.236 --> 01:53.659
I've been here for all nine weeks,
I've followed the rules,

01:53.739 --> 01:56.709
I haven't had a single warning,
then he comes swanning in.

01:56.825 --> 01:59.874
If they keep changing the rules,
I'm gonna protest, I am. You watch me.

01:59.995 --> 02:01.713
I'm gonna paint the walls.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.924
Would the Doctor
please come to the Diary Room?

02:20.724 --> 02:25.855
You are live on Channel 44, 00¢.
Please do not swear.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.405
You have got to be kidding.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.946
What happened?

03:16.071 --> 03:20.121
It's all right, it's the transmat.
It does your head in.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.287
You get a bit of amnesia.
What's your name?

03:24.246 --> 03:27.466
Rose. But where's the Doctor?

03:27.582 --> 03:32.463
Just remember, do what the android says.
Don't provoke it.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.136
The android's word is law.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.142
What do you mean, android?
Like a robot?

03:38.468 --> 03:40.846
Positions, everyone.
Thank you!

03:40.971 --> 03:42.814
Come on, hurry up.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.852
Steady.

03:48.812 --> 03:52.988
I was travelling... with the Doctor
and a man called Captain jack.

03:54.276 --> 03:55.903
The Doctor wouldn’t just leave me...

03:55.986 --> 04:00.662
That's enough chat.
Positions, final call. Good luck.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.625
But I'm not supposed to be here.

04:02.701 --> 04:06.456
It says Rose on the podium.
Come on.

04:21.052 --> 04:24.397
Hold on, I must be going mad.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.145
It can't be.
This looks like...

04:29.227 --> 04:31.025
Android activated!

04:32.022 --> 04:34.070
Oh, my God, the android.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.696
The Anne... droid.

04:39.362 --> 04:42.036
Welcome to The Weakest Link.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.126
Here we go again.
We've got our work cut out for us.

04:48.205 --> 04:52.210
I don 'f know, he's sort
of handsome. Has a good lantern jam

04:52.375 --> 04:54.719
Lantern jaws are so last year.

04:54.836 --> 04:58.215
Sorry, but, nice to meet you, ladies,
but where exactly am I?

04:58.340 --> 05:00.809
We're giving you
a brand-new image.

05:00.884 --> 05:02.727
Hold on, I was with the Doctor.

05:02.844 --> 05:05.313
Why, is there something wrong
with what I'm wearing?

05:05.388 --> 05:09.734
It's all very 20th century.
Where did you get that denim?

05:10.101 --> 05:13.731
A little place in Cardiff.
It was called The Top Shop.

05:13.855 --> 05:16.574
Design classic!

05:16.691 --> 05:19.069
But we 're going to have to find you
some new colour;

05:19.194 --> 05:23.244
maybe get rid of that "Oklahoma farm boy"
thing you've got going on.

05:23.448 --> 05:27.453
Just stand still and let the defabricator
work its magic.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.920
What's the defabricator?

05:36.920 --> 05:40.720
Okay. Defabricator.
Does exactly what it says on the tin.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.759
Am I naked in front
of millions of viewers?

05:42.884 --> 05:44.431
Absolutely!

05:44.761 --> 05:48.561
Ladies... your viewing
figures just went up.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.311
Can't open it.

05:52.435 --> 05:54.654
It's got a deadlock seal.
Ever since Big Brother 504

05:54.771 --> 05:57.445
when they all walked out,
you must remember that?

05:57.607 --> 05:58.904
What about this?

05:58.984 --> 06:01.578
That's Exoglass.
You need a nuclear bomb to get through.

06:01.653 --> 06:03.451
Don't tempt me.

06:05.615 --> 06:08.334
I know you're not supposed to talk about
the outside world,

06:08.451 --> 06:11.455
but you must've been watching.
Do people like me?

06:11.830 --> 06:13.673
Lynda, Lynda with a "Y"
not Linda with an

06:13.790 --> 06:17.795
She got forcibly evicted
'cause she damaged a camera. Am I popular?

06:18.837 --> 06:21.681
- I don't remember.
- Does that mean I'm nothing?

06:21.798 --> 06:25.803
Some people get this far 'cause they're
insignificant. Doesn't anybody notice me?

06:25.969 --> 06:30.349
No, you're... nice, you're sweet.
Everybody thinks you're sweet.

06:30.807 --> 06:36.189
Oh? Is that right? Is that what I am?
No one's ever told me that before.

06:36.313 --> 06:38.611
Am I sweet? Really?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.567
Yeah. Dead sweet.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.277
Thank you.

06:45.196 --> 06:48.120
It's a wall. Isn't there supposed to be
a garden out there?

06:48.199 --> 06:49.959
Don't be daft,
no one's got a garden anymore.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.042
Who's got a garden?
Don't tell me you've got a garden!

06:53.204 --> 06:55.172
No, I've just got the Tardis.

06:56.708 --> 06:57.834
I remember.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.508
That's the amnesia! So, what happened?
Where did they get you?

07:00.712 --> 07:02.840
We'd just left
Rexicoricophalvitorius.

07:02.964 --> 07:07.219
Then we went to Kyoto.
That's right, Japan, in 1336

07:07.344 --> 07:08.846
and we only just escaped.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.064
We were together,
we were laughing and then...

07:11.181 --> 07:14.685
there was this light, this white light
coming through the walls

07:14.809 --> 07:16.527
and then...

07:17.062 --> 07:18.530
I woke up here.

07:18.647 --> 07:21.696
Yeah, that's the transmat beam.
That's how they pick the housemates.

07:24.527 --> 07:29.078
Oh, Lynda with a
Sweet, little Lynda.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.331
It's worse than that.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.839
I'm not just some passing traveller.

07:35.914 --> 07:38.884
No stupid little transmat
gets inside my ship.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.594
That beam was 15 million
times more powerful.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.011
Which means... this isn’t just a game.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.850
There's something else going on.

07:50.679 --> 07:53.728
Well, here's the latest update
from the Big Brother house.

07:53.848 --> 07:57.227
I'm getting out.
I'm gonna find my friends.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.730
And then I'm gonna find you.

08:09.572 --> 08:13.042
- Need a word.
- Hold on, let me finish this.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.791
19, 18...

08:15.912 --> 08:19.758
17,16,15...

08:19.874 --> 08:23.344
Thank you, people, transmitting in...

08:23.420 --> 08:26.720
1111,10...

08:26.798 --> 08:28.391
I need to find the Doctor...

08:28.466 --> 08:30.810
just shut up and play the game.

08:31.219 --> 08:34.974
All right, then.
What the hell, I'm gonna play to win.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.933
And cue!

08:38.268 --> 08:42.148
Let's play The Weakest Link.
Start the clock.

08:42.772 --> 08:45.366
Agorax, the name of
which basic foodstuff

08:45.442 --> 08:48.787
is an anagram of
the word "beard"?

08:48.903 --> 08:50.496
- Bread.
- Correct.

08:50.613 --> 08:55.244
Fitch, in the Pan Traffic Calendar,
which month comes after Hoob?

08:55.326 --> 08:59.422
- Is it Clavadoe?
- No, Pandoffi

08:59.497 --> 09:03.673
Rose, in maths,
what is 258 minus 758?

09:03.793 --> 09:05.511
- 100!
- Correct.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.754
- Rodrick.
- Bank.

09:06.838 --> 09:08.681
Which letter of the alphabet

09:08.798 --> 09:12.302
appears in the word dangle
but not in the word gland?

09:13.094 --> 09:14.641
- E.
- Correct.

09:14.804 --> 09:18.650
Colleen, in social security,
what D is the name of the payment

09:18.767 --> 09:20.940
given to Martian Drones?

09:21.144 --> 09:22.737
- Default.
- Correct.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.315
Broff, the Great Cobalt Pyramid

09:25.482 --> 09:30.454
is built on the remains
of which famous Old Earth institute?

09:30.528 --> 09:33.657
- Touchdown.
- No, Torchwood.

09:34.532 --> 09:39.003
Agorax, in language,
all five examples of which type of letter

09:39.120 --> 09:41.589
appear in the word facetious?

09:41.664 --> 09:43.086
- Vowels.
- Correct.

09:43.166 --> 09:47.967
Fitch, in biology, which blood
cells contain iron, red or white?

09:49.881 --> 09:52.100
- White.
- No, red.

09:52.175 --> 09:56.351
Rose, in the holovid series,
Jupiter Rising,

09:56.471 --> 09:58.894
the Grexnik is married to whom?

09:59.516 --> 10:01.564
How should I know?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.153
Why is she laughing?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.906
Oh, my God, I think she knows.

10:11.152 --> 10:14.873
And I've got a housemate who appeared
out of nowhere. I told you.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.871
It's like the game's running itself.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.628
It's the Buccaneer look.

10:19.702 --> 10:22.546
Little dash of pirate and just a tweak of
President Schwarzenegger.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.218
Not sure about the vest. What about
a little bit of colour to lift it?

10:26.334 --> 10:29.178
Absolutely not
never wear black with colour.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.495
It makes the colour look cheap
and the black look boring.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.179
Now, let's talk jackets.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.683
- I kind of like the first one.
- No, that's a bit too much Hell's Angel.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.434
I think I like
the shorter one. Look!

10:38.555 --> 10:41.604
Waist-length, nice and slimming,
shows off the bum.

10:41.724 --> 10:42.941
Works for me.

10:43.059 --> 10:46.233
Once we've got an outfit
we can look at the face.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.231
Ever thought about
cosmetic surgery?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.609
I've considered it, yeah.
A little lift around the eyes,

10:50.733 --> 10:52.906
tighten up the jaw line,
what do you think?

10:53.069 --> 10:55.743
Let's have a biz' more ambit/on.

10:56.072 --> 10:59.076
Let? do something cutting edge.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.458
So, Rose,
what do you actually do?

11:02.579 --> 11:07.380
I just travel about a bit.
Bit of a tourist, I suppose.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.677
Another way of saying unemployed?

11:09.752 --> 11:11.925
- No!
- Have You got a job?

11:12.088 --> 11:14.261
Well, not really, no...

11:14.424 --> 11:15.971
Then you are unemployed.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.596
Yet you've still got enough money
to buy peroxide. Why Fitch?

11:20.305 --> 11:24.105
Er... I think she got
a few of the questions wrong, that's all.

11:25.476 --> 11:27.945
And you '0' know all about that.

11:28.271 --> 11:32.902
Well, yeah, but I can't vote for myself,
so it had to be Fitch.

11:35.153 --> 11:40.080
Sorry, that's the game, that's how it works.
I had to vote for someone.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.753
Let me try again. It was the lights
and everything, I couldn't think...

11:43.828 --> 11:48.254
In fact, with three answers wrong,
Broff was the Weakest Link in that round.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.006
But it's votes that count!

11:50.126 --> 11:54.973
I'm sorry, please.
Oh, God, help me.

11:59.677 --> 12:02.851
Fitch, you are
the Weakest Link. Goodbye.

12:10.355 --> 12:14.155
And we've gone to the adverts.
Back in three minutes.

12:14.984 --> 12:17.533
What's that?
What just happened?

12:17.654 --> 12:20.282
She was the Weakest Link,
she gets disintegrated.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.332
Blasted into atoms.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.831
But I voted for her.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.218
Oh, my God, this is sick.

12:33.336 --> 12:36.010
All of you, you're just sick.
I'm not playing...

12:36.130 --> 12:41.352
I'm not playing!
I can't do it.

12:43.846 --> 12:45.723
Please,
somebody let me out of here.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.351
You are the Weakest Link.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.814
Goodbye.

12:58.861 --> 13:01.205
Don't try to escape.

13:01.364 --> 13:04.038
It's play or die.

13:08.913 --> 13:13.009
Doctor, they said all housemates
must gather on the sofa, you've got to.

13:13.084 --> 13:14.711
I'm busy getting out, thanks.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.927
But if you don't obey,
then all the housemates get punished.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.850
Well, maybe I'll be voted out, then.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.179
How stupid are you? You've only
just joined, you're not eligible.

13:24.262 --> 13:27.106
And don't try anything clever
or we all get it in the neck.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.022
Big Brother house,
this is Davinadroid.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.524
Crosbie, Lynda and Strood

13:32.603 --> 13:36.733
you have all been nominated for eviction.
And the eighth person to he evicted

13:36.858 --> 13:39.202
from the Big Brother house is...

13:42.071 --> 13:44.950
- Crosbie!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.370
It should've been me,
that's not fair, Crosbie.

13:48.453 --> 13:51.423
Crosbie, you have 70 seconds
to make your farewells

13:51.539 --> 13:53.416
and then We're going to get you!

13:54.250 --> 13:56.002
I won't forget you.

13:56.085 --> 13:59.214
- I'm sorry I stole your soap.
- I don't mind, honestly.

13:59.297 --> 14:02.551
And thanks for the food,
you're a smashing cook. Bless you.

14:03.468 --> 14:06.642
Crosbie, please leave
the Big Brother house.

14:11.601 --> 14:14.445
Bye, then. Bye, Lynda.

14:14.729 --> 14:16.106
Bye.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.961
I don't believe it. Crosbie.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.461
It's only a game show.
She'll make a fortune on the outside.

14:33.581 --> 14:38.132
Sell her story, release a record, fitness
video, all of that. She'll be laughing.

14:38.336 --> 14:41.306
- What do you mean, on the outside?
- Here we go.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.351
What are they waiting for?
Why don't they just let her go?

14:53.476 --> 14:55.478
Stop it, it's not funny.

14:58.272 --> 15:01.572
Eviction in 5, 4...

15:01.651 --> 15:05.155
3,2, 7.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.673
What was that?

15:17.458 --> 15:19.335
Disintegrator beam.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.471
She's been evicted.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.517
From life.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.648
No one programmed the transmat,
no one selected new contestants.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.449
It is exactly like those stories.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.528
Don't start that again.
I think you need to take a session off.

15:44.694 --> 15:46.617
I would,
if you'd take it with me.

15:46.696 --> 15:49.245
And don't start that again either.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.867
But the rumours go back decades.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.415
Saying that something's been
hidden up here.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.379
Underneath the transmissions.

15:56.372 --> 15:59.876
But the Controller would know.
She watches everything.

16:01.002 --> 16:04.723
Maybe she just can't see it.
You've got to allow for human error.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.091
Well, that's your problem, then.

16:08.843 --> 16:11.392
I don't think she's been human for years.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.117
18,19, 20.

16:26.235 --> 16:27.703
Transmit.

16:27.778 --> 16:31.248
Are you insane?
You just step right into the disintegrator?

16:31.365 --> 16:34.869
Is it that important getting your face
on the telly? Is it worth dying for?

16:34.952 --> 16:38.172
- You're talking like we've got a choice!
- I thought you had to apply.

16:38.247 --> 16:41.091
Don't be so stupid.
That's how they played it centuries back.

16:41.209 --> 16:43.507
You get chosen
whether you like it or not.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.634
Everyone on Earth
is a potential contestant,

16:45.755 --> 16:48.008
the transmat beam picks you
out at random.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.515
And it's nonstop. There are
60 Big Brother houses all running at once.

16:51.594 --> 16:54.894
- How many? 60?
- They've had to cut back, it's not what it was.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.816
It's a charnel house.
What about the winners? What do they get?

16:57.934 --> 16:59.652
- They get to live.
- Is that it?

16:59.769 --> 17:01.942
Well, isn't that enough?

17:02.939 --> 17:06.910
Rose is out there. She got
caught in the transmat, she's a contestant.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.369
Time I got out.

17:09.444 --> 17:13.040
That other contestant, Linda with an
she was forcibly evicted for what?

17:13.115 --> 17:15.959
- Damage to property.
- What, like this?

17:18.663 --> 17:20.961
No, I'm just not getting this.

17:21.165 --> 17:25.796
It's just too safe. Too decent.
And you'd never keep it clean.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.547
Stage two ready and waiting.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.348
Bring it on, girls.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.773
And now it's time
for the face-off!

17:37.848 --> 17:40.168
What does that mean?
Do I get to compete with someone else?

17:40.268 --> 17:43.147
No, like I said, face... off.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.985
I think you 'd look
good with a dog's head!

17:50.361 --> 17:53.410
Or maybe no head at all,
that would be so outrageous.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.208
And we could stitch your legs
to the middle of your chest.

17:56.325 --> 17:59.329
Nothing is too extreme.
It's to die for.

17:59.453 --> 18:02.297
Hold on, ladies, I don't want to have
to shoot either one of you.

18:02.373 --> 18:04.876
- But you're unarmed.
- You 're naked!

18:05.543 --> 18:10.219
- But that's a Compact Laser Deluxe.
- Where were you hiding that?

18:10.339 --> 18:12.216
You really don't want to know.

18:12.341 --> 18:14.139
Give me that accessory!

18:17.847 --> 18:20.817
You are the Weakest Link.
Goodbye.

18:27.398 --> 18:29.742
Going to the break,
two minutes on the clock.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.783
Just a reminder, we've got solar
flare activity coming up in 10.

18:32.862 --> 18:34.079
Thanks, everyone.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.450
Colleen was clever, she banked all
our money, why'd you vote for her?

18:37.533 --> 18:40.127
'Cause I want to keep you in.
You're stupid.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.081
You don't even know
the Princess Vossaheen's surname.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.425
When it comes to the final,
I want to be up against you.

18:46.542 --> 18:50.638
So that you get disintegrated
and I get a stackload of credits.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.011
Courtesy of the Bad Wolf Corporation.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.513
What do you mean?
Who's Bad Wolf?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.806
They're in charge,
they run the Game Station.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.516
Why are they called Bad Wolf?

19:01.599 --> 19:03.351
I don't know, it's just a name.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.903
It's like an Old Earth
nursery rhyme sort of thing.

19:06.020 --> 19:07.363
What does it matter?

19:07.438 --> 19:11.238
I keep hearing those words
everywhere we go. Bad Wolf.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.196
The things you see...

19:14.945 --> 19:16.743
the darkness.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.583
The big, bad wolf.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.163
Attention all personnel,
Bad Wolf 1 descending.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.497
"Blaidd Drwg."

19:24.580 --> 19:26.924
- What's it mean?
- Bad Wolf.

19:29.752 --> 19:34.007
Different times, different places.
Like it's written all over the universe.

19:34.090 --> 19:35.558
What are you going on about?

19:35.633 --> 19:40.059
If the Bad Wolf is in charge of the quiz
then maybe I'm not here by mistake.

19:42.431 --> 19:44.729
Someone's been planning this.

19:45.935 --> 19:48.029
The Doctor, you've
broken the house rules.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.948
[Biz] Brother has no
choice but to evict you.

19:51.065 --> 19:55.411
You have 70 seconds to make your farewells
and then we're gonna get you!

19:55.486 --> 19:58.035
That's more like it!
Come on, then, open up!

19:58.114 --> 19:59.991
You're mad,
it's like you want to die.

20:00.116 --> 20:03.370
I reckon he's a plant,
he was only brought in to stir things up.

20:03.452 --> 20:06.956
The Doctor,
please leave the Big Brother house.

20:09.125 --> 20:12.504
Come on, then, disintegrate me!
Come on, what are you waiting for?

20:12.628 --> 20:15.177
He is, he's mad. He's bonkers!

20:15.297 --> 20:17.550
I told you to keep
an eye on him, not kill him.

20:17.633 --> 20:19.806
He damaged the property,
it's an automatic process.

20:22.972 --> 20:29.196
Eviction in .54, 3, 2, 7-

20:33.774 --> 20:36.994
Ha-ha! I knew it! You see,
someone brought me into this game.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.910
If they wanted me dead they could've
transmatted me into a volcano.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.037
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

20:42.158 --> 20:44.160
It's like some sort of override.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.038
Maybe the security
isn't as tight this end.

20:47.163 --> 20:49.541
You following this?
I'm getting out!

20:54.628 --> 20:57.381
- Come with me.
- We're not allowed.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.055
Stay in there,
you got a 50-50 chance of disintegration.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.100
Stay with me, I promise I'll
get you out alive. Come on!

21:03.179 --> 21:04.647
No, I can't.

21:04.722 --> 21:07.191
Lynda, you're sweet.
From what I've seen of your world,

21:07.308 --> 21:09.811
do you think
anybody votes for sweet?

21:21.030 --> 21:23.874
Hold on.
I've been here before.

21:24.742 --> 21:26.710
This is Satellite Five.

21:33.584 --> 21:35.837
No guards, makes a change.

21:35.920 --> 21:39.049
You'd think a big business like Satellite
Five would be armed to the teeth.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.971
No one's called it
Satellite Five in ages.

21:41.050 --> 21:44.771
It's the Game Station now. Hasn't been
Satellite Five in about 100 years.

21:45.179 --> 21:49.184
100 years exactly.
It's the year 200100.

21:49.433 --> 21:52.027
I was here before, Floor 139.

21:52.102 --> 21:55.197
The Satellite was broadcasting
news channels back then.

21:55.898 --> 21:58.196
Had a bit of trouble upstairs.
Nothing too serious.

21:58.275 --> 22:01.575
Easy, gave them a hand,
home in time for tea.

22:02.071 --> 22:06.918
Hundred years ago? What?
You were here 100 years ago?

22:07.034 --> 22:08.251
Yes.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.250
Well, you're looking good on it.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.248
I moisturise.

22:12.748 --> 22:16.753
Funny sorts of readings.
All kinds of energy. Place is humming.

22:16.877 --> 22:20.097
It's weird, this goes way beyond
normal transmissions.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.137
What would they need
all that power for?

22:22.258 --> 22:26.729
I don't know. I think we're
the first ever contestants to get outside.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.144
I had two friends with me,

22:29.265 --> 22:31.768
they must have got caught in the transmat.
Where would they be?

22:31.892 --> 22:33.894
I don't know,
they could have been allocated anywhere.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.651
There's 100 different games.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.485
Like what?

22:37.606 --> 22:39.887
There's 10 ﬂoors of Big Brother,
there's a different house

22:39.942 --> 22:43.412
behind each of these doors, and then
beyond that there's all sorts of shows.

22:43.487 --> 22:47.162
It's nonstop.
There's Call My Bluff, with real guns.

22:47.283 --> 22:51.208
Countdown, where you got 30 seconds
to stop the bomb going off.

22:51.287 --> 22:55.918
Ground Force, which is a nasty one.
You get turned into compost.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.798
Wipeout, speaks for itself.

22:57.960 --> 23:01.840
Oh, and Stars In Their Eyes, literally,
stars in their eyes.

23:01.964 --> 23:04.592
If you don't sing,
you get blinded.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.393
And you watch this stuff?

23:06.468 --> 23:08.596
Everyone does.
How come you don't?

23:08.679 --> 23:10.101
Never paid for my license.

23:10.180 --> 23:13.104
Oh, my God,
you get executed for that.

23:13.183 --> 23:14.685
Let them try.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.900
You keep saying things
that don't make sense.

23:17.980 --> 23:20.028
Who are you,
though, Doctor, really?

23:21.025 --> 23:22.823
It doesn't matter.

23:23.527 --> 23:26.371
Well, it does to me.
I've just put my life in your hands.

23:26.488 --> 23:31.210
I'm just a traveller wandering past. Believe
it or not, all I'm after is a quiet life.

23:31.327 --> 23:36.208
So, if we get out of here, what are you
going to do? just wander off again?

23:36.373 --> 23:38.125
As fast as I can.

23:38.542 --> 23:41.842
'Cause, erm... I could come with you.

23:45.674 --> 23:48.143
- Maybe you could.
- I wouldn't get in the way.

23:48.218 --> 23:52.064
I wouldn't mind if you did.
Not a bad idea, Lynda with a

23:54.350 --> 23:57.399
But first of all, we've got to concentrate
on the getting out.

23:57.519 --> 24:00.989
To do that, you've got to know your enemy.
Who's controlling it?

24:01.065 --> 24:03.443
Who's in charge of
the Satellite now?

24:03.525 --> 24:04.822
Hold on.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.913
Your lords and masters.

24:19.500 --> 24:22.595
Okay, you win,
the Controller's got to handle this.

24:22.711 --> 24:25.555
Archive makes a record
of all transmat activities.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.346
Find out how he got on board.

24:27.424 --> 24:29.222
Archive 6.

24:53.742 --> 24:56.916
Controller, we have a problem.

24:57.579 --> 24:59.297
Continue working.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.254
We have a security problem.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.093
Continue working.

25:05.295 --> 25:09.220
I'm sorry, but I can't.
We have contestants outside of the games.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.972
But the alarms haven't gone off.

25:11.093 --> 25:13.437
No security,
the games continue.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.814
But we can't just let them wander.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.604
They are no one.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.604
They are no one.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.869
I'm sorry, I was just...

25:28.944 --> 25:30.867
Archive 6 is out of bounds.

25:30.946 --> 25:32.539
I need to check the transmat log.

25:32.614 --> 25:37.586
Archive 6 is out of bounds.
No one may enter Archive 6. Return to work.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.757
Return to work.

25:47.629 --> 25:51.759
Inform all staff,
solar flares in Delta .7.

25:57.431 --> 26:01.481
Compatible systems,
just align the wave signature.

26:02.436 --> 26:03.983
Attaboy!

26:04.104 --> 26:08.359
Got myself a gun.
Well, ladies, the pleasure was all mine,

26:08.484 --> 26:10.987
which is the only thing
that matters in the end.

26:19.620 --> 26:22.214
Two hearts, that's him.
Which ﬂoor?

26:28.670 --> 26:33.892
Blimey! I've never seen it for real before,
not from orbit.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.144
Planet Earth!

26:36.220 --> 26:37.813
What's happened to it?

26:37.888 --> 26:40.892
It's always been like that,
ever since I was born. See that there?

26:41.016 --> 26:43.690
That's the Great Atlantic Smog Storm,
it's been going 20 years.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.564
We get newsﬂashes telling us when
it's safe to breathe outside.

26:46.688 --> 26:49.942
So the population just sits there?
Half the world's too fat

26:50.025 --> 26:52.494
and half the world's too thin
and you lot just watch telly?

26:52.569 --> 26:55.038
10,000 channels.
All beaming down from here.

26:55.155 --> 26:59.001
The human race.
Brainless sheep, being fed on a diet of...

26:59.076 --> 27:02.671
Have they still got that program where
three people have to live with a bear?

27:02.746 --> 27:04.339
Bear With Me! I love that!

27:04.414 --> 27:06.758
The celebrity edition
where the bear got in the bath.

27:06.875 --> 27:10.345
But it's all gone wrong.
I mean, history's gone wrong. Again!

27:10.504 --> 27:13.223
This should be the Fourth Great
and Bountiful Human Empire.

27:13.340 --> 27:16.344
I don't understand.
Last time I was here I put it right.

27:16.718 --> 27:19.187
No, but that's when it first went wrong.
100 years ago.

27:19.263 --> 27:23.609
Like you said, all the news channels,
they just shut down overnight.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.317
But that was me. I did that.

27:27.396 --> 27:29.774
There was nothing left in their place.
No information.

27:29.898 --> 27:33.744
The whole planet just froze. The
government, the economy, they collapsed.

27:33.944 --> 27:38.040
That was the start of it.
100 years of hell.

27:38.115 --> 27:39.458
Oh, my...

27:43.912 --> 27:45.710
I made this world.

27:53.255 --> 27:57.726
That leaves Rose and Rodrick.
You're going head-to-head.

27:58.427 --> 28:00.805
Left play The Weakest Link!

28:01.430 --> 28:05.151
Right, that's the end of tactical voting.
You're on your own now.

28:07.936 --> 28:11.156
Hey, handsome, good to see you.
Any sign of Rose?

28:11.273 --> 28:12.570
Can't you track her down?

28:12.649 --> 28:15.619
She must still be inside the games.
All the rooms are shielded.

28:15.736 --> 28:18.785
If I can just get inside this computer.
She's got to be here somewhere.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.306
You'd better hurry up,
these games don't have a happy ending.

28:21.408 --> 28:24.002
You think I don't know that?

28:24.411 --> 28:27.881
There you go, patch that in.
It's programmed to find her.

28:27.956 --> 28:29.583
- Thanks.
- Hey, there.

28:29.666 --> 28:31.464
- Hello.
- Captain Jack Harkness.

28:31.627 --> 28:33.721
- Lynda Moss.
- Nice to meet you, Lynda Moss.

28:33.795 --> 28:36.036
- Do you mind ﬂirting outside?
- I was just saying hello.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.306
For you, that's flirting.

28:37.424 --> 28:39.518
- I'm not complaining.
- Muchas gracias.

28:39.635 --> 28:42.809
It's not compatible.
This stupid system doesn't make sense.

28:45.974 --> 28:50.525
This place should be a basic broadcaster.
But the systems are twice as complicated.

28:50.646 --> 28:53.775
It's more than just television.
This station's transmitting something else.

28:53.857 --> 28:55.484
- Like what?
- I don't know.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.862
This whole Bad Wolf
thing's tied up with me.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.159
Someone's manipulated my entire life.

29:00.280 --> 29:02.453
It's some sort of trap
and Rose is stuck inside it.

29:02.532 --> 29:03.909
Rose, in geography,

29:03.992 --> 29:07.963
the Grand Central Ra vine
is named after which ancient British city?

29:08.830 --> 29:10.332
Is it York?

29:10.457 --> 29:12.710
No, the correct answer is Sheffield.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.257
Found her. Floor 407.

29:15.337 --> 29:18.090
Oh, my God, she's with the Anne Droid!
You've got to get her out of there!

29:18.173 --> 29:21.973
Rodrick, in literature,
the author of Lucky was Jackie who?

29:22.052 --> 29:23.554
Stewart.

29:23.679 --> 29:26.478
No, the correct answer is Collins.

29:26.890 --> 29:31.987
Rose, the oldest inhabitant
of the [sop Galaxy is the Face of what?

29:32.354 --> 29:33.981
Boe! The Face of Boe!

29:37.192 --> 29:39.570
That is the correct answer.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.249
Come on.

29:45.242 --> 29:49.213
Rodrick, in history who was
the President of the Red Velvets?

29:49.746 --> 29:50.872
Hoshbin Frane.

29:50.998 --> 29:52.875
That is the correct answer.

29:53.375 --> 29:58.882
Rose, in food the dish Gaffabeque
originated on which plane t?

30:02.175 --> 30:04.394
Erm... is it...

30:07.389 --> 30:10.893
- Mars?
- No, the correct answer is Lucifer.

30:17.566 --> 30:21.070
Rodrick, which measurement of length
is said to have been defined

30:21.194 --> 30:25.700
by the Emperor Jate as the distance
from his nose to his fingertip?

30:27.075 --> 30:28.998
Would that be a goffle?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.455
No, the correct answer is a paab.

30:31.788 --> 30:35.918
Rose, in fashion,
Stella Pok Baint is famous for what?

30:40.464 --> 30:41.886
Shoes.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.093
No, the correct answer is hats.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.680
Game Room 6, which one is it?

30:47.763 --> 30:48.980
Over here!

30:49.097 --> 30:51.191
San... Hazeldine?

30:51.266 --> 30:53.860
Na, the correct
answer is San Chen.

30:53.935 --> 30:55.528
Stand back,
let me blast it open.

30:55.604 --> 30:57.072
You can't,
it's a vital combination.

30:57.147 --> 31:02.654
Rose, in history, which Icelandic city
hosted Murder Spree 20?

31:11.453 --> 31:12.796
Reykjavik?

31:16.500 --> 31:19.128
No, the correct answer is Pola Ventura.

31:23.965 --> 31:27.595
Oh, my God!
I've done it! You've lost!

31:29.012 --> 31:31.356
Come on, come on!

31:31.473 --> 31:34.852
- Rodrick, you are the Strongest Link.
- I'm not meant to be here.

31:34.976 --> 31:37.070
You will be transported home
with 7, 609 credits.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.364
I need to find the Doctor!

31:39.481 --> 31:42.234
- He wouldn’t just leave me!
- Thank you so much.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.991
This game is illegal,
I'm telling you to stop!

31:45.112 --> 31:48.286
Rose! Stop this game.
I order you to stop this game!

31:48.365 --> 31:52.495
- You are the Weakest link.
- Look out for the Anne Droid, it's armed!

32:07.884 --> 32:10.057
Back off!

32:10.220 --> 32:14.225
I need security and I
need it here right now!

32:15.350 --> 32:18.320
- It's this lot.
- Don't you touch him! Leave him alone!

32:18.395 --> 32:21.194
Sir, put down the gun
or I'll have to shoot.

32:21.523 --> 32:23.400
You killed her!

32:23.525 --> 32:26.369
Your stupid freaking
game show killed her!

32:26.486 --> 32:30.832
Sir, I'm arresting you under Private
Legislation 16 of the Game Station...

32:48.383 --> 32:50.852
Can you tell us the purpose of
this device, sir?

32:50.927 --> 32:53.180
Can you tell us
how you got on board?

32:53.263 --> 32:55.106
Just leave him alone.

32:56.057 --> 32:57.900
I'm asking him.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.736
Sir?
Can you tell us who you are?

33:10.739 --> 33:13.413
You will be taken from this place
to the Lunar Penal Colony,

33:13.533 --> 33:16.912
there to be held without trial.
You may not appeal against this sentence.

33:19.748 --> 33:21.716
Is that understood?

33:28.632 --> 33:30.134
Let's do it.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.739
Oh, my God, now we're in trouble.

33:46.399 --> 33:47.651
Floor 500.

33:49.945 --> 33:53.950
Clear the ﬂoor! He's on his way up here.
With a gun!

33:59.621 --> 34:02.044
This is an emergency,
you've got to close down the lift.

34:02.123 --> 34:03.420
All staff are
reminded that solar flares...

34:03.500 --> 34:06.253
Never mind the solar flares,
he's gonna kill you!

34:09.339 --> 34:13.469
Okay, move away from the desk.
Nobody try anything clever.

34:13.592 --> 34:17.188
Everybody clear,
stand to the side and stay there.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.103
Who's in charge of this place?

34:19.181 --> 34:21.810
- This Satellite is more than a Game Station.
- ...79, 80...

34:21.935 --> 34:23.312
Who killed Rose Tyler?

34:23.436 --> 34:26.531
- All staff are reminded that...
- I want an answer.

34:26.648 --> 34:28.571
She can't reply. Don't shoot!

34:28.650 --> 34:31.027
Don't be so thick,
like I was ever gonna shoot.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.954
Captain, we've got more
guards on the way up.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.188
- Secure the exits.
- Yes, sir!

34:34.197 --> 34:35.665
You! What were you saying?

34:35.864 --> 34:38.994
- But I've got your gun.
- Okay, so shoot me. Why can't she answer?

34:39.119 --> 34:41.338
She's... Can I put this down?

34:41.454 --> 34:43.581
- If you want, just hurry up.
- Thanks.

34:43.665 --> 34:47.761
Sorry. The Controller
is linked into the transmissions.

34:47.835 --> 34:49.838
The entire output
goes through her brain.

34:49.963 --> 34:52.887
You're not a member of staff
so she doesn't recognise your existence.

34:53.007 --> 34:54.726
- What's her name?
- I don't know.

34:54.842 --> 34:58.188
She was installed when she was five.
It's the only life she's ever known.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.644
Doors sealed.
We should be safe for about 10 minutes.

35:00.724 --> 35:01.850
Keep an eye on them.

35:01.975 --> 35:04.148
What you were saying
about the Game Station,

35:04.227 --> 35:06.195
I think you're right.
I've kept a log.

35:06.313 --> 35:09.988
Unauthorised transmats, encrypted signals,
it's been going on for years.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.158
Show me.

35:11.234 --> 35:14.033
You're not allowed in there.
Archive 6 is out of bounds.

35:14.154 --> 35:16.703
Do I look like an out
of bounds sort of guy?

35:44.059 --> 35:45.686
What the hell?

35:50.357 --> 35:52.576
Solar flare activity in Delta .015.

35:52.734 --> 35:56.079
If you're not holding us hostage
then let us out. The staff are terrified.

35:56.237 --> 35:58.740
That's the same staff who execute hundreds
of contestants every day?

35:58.865 --> 36:00.412
We're just doing our jobs.

36:00.533 --> 36:04.083
And with that sentence you just lost
the right to even talk to me, now back off!

36:08.583 --> 36:11.757
That's just the solar flares.
They interfere with the broadcast signal

36:11.878 --> 36:14.176
so this place
automatically powers down.

36:14.255 --> 36:17.930
Planet Earth gets a few repeats.
It's all quite normal.

36:18.093 --> 36:19.436
Doctor...

36:19.719 --> 36:21.938
- Doctor?
- Whatever it is, you can wait.

36:22.055 --> 36:23.853
I think she wants you.

36:23.932 --> 36:28.312
Doctor. Doctor. Where's the Doctor?

36:28.603 --> 36:29.900
I'm here.

36:29.979 --> 36:33.279
Can't see. Blind, so blind.

36:33.400 --> 36:37.246
All my life blind, all I can see is numbers.
But I saw you.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.870
- What do you want?
- Solar flares hiding me, they can't hear me.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.576
My Masters listen but
they can't hear me now.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.332
The sun is so bright.

36:44.452 --> 36:46.329
Who are your masters?

36:46.454 --> 36:50.425
They wired my head, the name's forbidden.
They control my thoughts.

36:50.500 --> 36:53.094
My Masters,
I had to be careful.

36:53.169 --> 36:56.264
They monitor transmission
but they don't watch the programs.

36:56.339 --> 36:58.888
I could hide you in the games.
I knew that you'd find me.

36:58.967 --> 37:00.810
My friend died inside your games.

37:00.927 --> 37:02.895
- Doesn't matter.
- Don't dare tell me that!

37:02.971 --> 37:06.646
They've been hiding.
My Masters, hiding in the dark space.

37:06.766 --> 37:10.862
Watching and shaping the Earth,
so many years.

37:11.646 --> 37:15.742
Always been there, guiding humanity.
Hundreds and hundreds of years.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.114
Who are they?

37:17.193 --> 37:19.821
They wait and plan and grow in numbers,
they're strong now.

37:19.946 --> 37:22.324
- So strong, my Masters...
- Who are they?

37:22.449 --> 37:25.828
But speak of you, my Masters,
they fear the Doctor...

37:25.952 --> 37:28.501
Tell me, who are they?

37:35.003 --> 37:36.425
When's the next solar flare?

37:36.504 --> 37:38.598
- Two years' time.
- Fat lot of good that is!

37:38.673 --> 37:40.892
- Found the Tardis.
- We're not leaving now.

37:41.009 --> 37:45.515
No, but the Tardis worked it out.
You'll wanna watch this.

37:45.638 --> 37:47.811
Lynda, could you
stand over there for me, please?

37:47.891 --> 37:49.518
I just want to go home.

37:49.642 --> 37:53.317
It'll only take a second. Could you stand
in that spot? Quick as you can.

37:53.396 --> 37:57.867
Everybody watching?
Okay, 3, 2, 1.

38:03.239 --> 38:06.038
- But you killed her.
- Oh? Do you think?

38:10.914 --> 38:12.791
What the hell was that?

38:12.874 --> 38:15.548
It's a transmat beam.
Not a disintegrator.

38:15.668 --> 38:19.673
A secondary transmat system.
People don't get killed in the games.

38:19.756 --> 38:24.011
They get transported across space.
Doctor, Rose is still alive!

38:38.691 --> 38:40.785
No. It can't be...

38:41.945 --> 38:44.744
You're dead. I saw you die!

38:48.910 --> 38:52.756
- She's out there somewhere.
- Doctor! Coordinates 5.6.1.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.795
Don't! The solar flare's gone,
they'll hear you!

38:54.916 --> 38:58.466
434. No, my Masters, no, I defy you!

38:58.586 --> 39:01.305
Sigma 77...

39:03.424 --> 39:05.267
They took her.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.619
My Masters.

39:28.283 --> 39:32.459
You can kill me.
For I have brought your destruction.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.380
Use that, it might
contain the final numbers.

39:41.462 --> 39:43.965
I kept a log of all
the unscheduled transmissions.

39:44.090 --> 39:48.516
Nice, thanks.
Captain Jack Harkness, by the way.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.560
- I'm Davitch Pavale.
- Nice to meet you, Davitch Pavale.

39:51.639 --> 39:53.232
There's a time and a place.

39:53.308 --> 39:56.187
Are you saying this whole setup's been
a disguise all along?

39:56.436 --> 39:59.531
Going way back.
Installing the Jagrafess 100 years ago.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.820
Someone's been
playing a long game.

40:01.941 --> 40:05.411
Controlling the human race
from behind the scenes for generations.

40:05.486 --> 40:07.329
Click on this.

40:10.992 --> 40:14.963
The transmat delivers to that point,
right on the edge of the solar system.

40:15.038 --> 40:16.631
There's nothing there.

40:16.706 --> 40:19.835
It looks like nothing
because that's what this Satellite does!

40:19.959 --> 40:22.508
Underneath the transmission,
there's another signal.

40:22.629 --> 40:25.678
- Doing what?
- Hiding whatever's out there.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.176
Hiding it from sonar,
radar, scanners.

40:28.968 --> 40:31.767
There's something sitting
right on top of planet Earth

40:31.846 --> 40:34.144
but it's completely invisible.

40:34.223 --> 40:36.567
If I cancel the signal...

40:54.369 --> 40:57.669
That's impossible.
I know those ships.

40:58.206 --> 41:00.004
They were destroyed.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.794
Obviously they survived.

41:02.877 --> 41:04.720
Who did? Who are they?

41:04.837 --> 41:09.343
200 ships.
More than 2,000 on board each one.

41:09.425 --> 41:11.519
That's just about half a million of them.

41:11.594 --> 41:13.471
Half a million what?

41:13.554 --> 41:15.022
Daleks.

41:16.015 --> 41:19.610
Alert. Alert. We are detected!

41:19.727 --> 41:25.450
It is the Doctor! He has located us.
Open communications channel.

41:26.067 --> 41:30.243
The female will stand. Stand!

41:37.245 --> 41:39.714
I will talk to the Doctor.

41:40.123 --> 41:42.251
Oh, will you?
That's nice. Hello.

41:42.375 --> 41:47.472
The Dalek Stratagem nears completion.
The Fleet is almost ready.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.590
You will not intervene.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.517
Oh, really? Why's that, then?

41:51.592 --> 41:53.936
We have your associate.

41:54.929 --> 41:58.900
You will obey or she
will be exterminate-d.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.737
No.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.782
Explain yourself.

42:11.070 --> 42:12.617
I said, no.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.666
What is
the meaning of this negative?

42:15.783 --> 42:17.285
It means no.

42:17.410 --> 42:19.504
But she will be destroyed!

42:19.662 --> 42:24.589
No, 'cause this is what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna rescue her.

42:24.667 --> 42:27.591
I'm gonna save Rose Tyler
from the middle of the Dalek Fleet.

42:27.670 --> 42:31.015
And then I'm gonna save the Earth.
And then, just to finish off,

42:31.132 --> 42:35.308
I'm gonna wipe every
last stinking Dalek out of the sky!

42:35.428 --> 42:39.934
But you have no weapons!
No defences! No plan!

42:40.016 --> 42:43.646
Yeah. And doesn't
that scare you to death?

42:44.479 --> 42:45.526
Rose?

42:45.646 --> 42:46.943
Yes, Doctor?

42:47.023 --> 42:48.991
I'm coming to get you.

42:49.776 --> 42:52.825
The Doctor is
initiating hostile action.

42:52.945 --> 42:58.372
The Stratagem must advance.
Begin the invasion of Earth.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.996
The Doctor will
be exterminate-d.

43:01.120 --> 43:05.000
Exterminate.
Exterminate...

43:13.508 --> 43:16.307
Launch missiles. Exterminate.

43:17.386 --> 43:21.732
We've got incoming. This is it,
ladies and gentlemen, we are at war.

43:22.058 --> 43:25.187
There's an army
about to invade this station.

43:26.229 --> 43:27.526
Defences have gone off line.

43:27.647 --> 43:31.652
I'm dead, or about to die any second,
with no chance of escape.

43:44.747 --> 43:46.795
How did you
survive the Time War?

43:46.874 --> 43:49.878
They survived through me.
