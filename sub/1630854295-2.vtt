03:58.204 --> 03:59.706
Before I started
The Woobles,

03:59.706 --> 04:02.542
I used to lead user experience

Oh, really?

of my career

04:04.344 --> 04:07.347

working on education products.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.549

04:09.549 --> 04:11.685
I was so great that
they made me a manager,

04:11.685 --> 04:14.221

I sucked at being a manager.

04:14.221 --> 04:15.288
[ Laughter ]

04:15.288 --> 04:17.023
And so to take
my mind off of work,

04:17.023 --> 04:19.024
I started dabbling in
all these other hobbies,

04:19.024 --> 04:20.961
and crochet was
one of those things.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.396
And learning to crochet
reminded me that I still

04:23.396 --> 04:25.766
have it in me to
learn something new,

04:25.766 --> 04:28.335
that I could try to become
a better manager.

04:28.335 --> 04:30.570
And so that experience
of really building

04:30.570 --> 04:32.572
back my confidence
through crochet

04:32.572 --> 04:33.707
is why we started this.

experience.

Are you still at Google?

Oh, no, no, no.
This is a 100% full time.

Is it full time
for both of you?

04:40.947 --> 04:42.015
Yes.
Yes.

04:42.015 --> 04:43.350
And what's your
background?

04:43.350 --> 04:46.253
From a really young age,
I've been taught that success

04:46.253 --> 04:48.688
means getting good grades,
going to a good school,

04:48.688 --> 04:50.557
and getting
a really high-paying job.

04:50.557 --> 04:51.925
And that's
exactly what I did.

04:51.925 --> 04:54.294
So I became one of the youngest
directors on Wall Street.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.596
I traded billions of dollars
in equities.

04:56.596 --> 04:58.398
Wow.
But I wasn't any happier

04:58.398 --> 05:00.167
at the end of it
than when I started.

05:00.167 --> 05:02.669
And what I began to realize
was that I had spent

05:02.669 --> 05:04.838
all that time working
towards someone else's

05:04.838 --> 05:06.640
definition of success.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.708
And so I left it
all behind to go

05:08.708 --> 05:11.878
and try and figure out what
my own definition of success is.

05:11.878 --> 05:13.446
I knew from
a really young age

05:13.446 --> 05:15.315
that I really liked
helping people,

05:15.315 --> 05:17.818
and then when we started
thinking about crochet kits,

05:17.818 --> 05:19.786
what's really neat about it
is that it is that

05:19.786 --> 05:20.954
confidence boost.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.256
Sometimes as we get older,
you kind of stop

05:23.256 --> 05:25.025
learning new things,
you start saying things like,

05:25.025 --> 05:26.593
"You know,
I'm too old to learn that."

05:26.593 --> 05:29.129
And so what brings me joy
with these kits

05:29.129 --> 05:30.831
is that they're
a little confidence boost

05:30.831 --> 05:33.600
to remind you that you can
always learn something new.

05:33.600 --> 05:37.070
So exactly two years ago,
we started this business.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.506
We took $200,
we bought some yarn,

05:39.506 --> 05:40.707
and we bought
a domain name.

05:40.707 --> 05:43.810
And since then,
we've done $5.3 million.

05:43.810 --> 05:45.579
-Wow!
-Son of a gun!
-What?!

05:45.579 --> 05:46.613

05:46.613 --> 05:47.881

That's incredible.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.249
What are you gonna do --
Yeah, so year to date,

05:49.249 --> 05:50.584
we've done $3.1 million.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.819
And if we assume
that we just stop growing

05:52.819 --> 05:55.755
from this point on out,
we'll do $7 million this year.

05:55.755 --> 05:58.191
Cuban: You're dir--
Okay, you're direct to consumer,

05:58.191 --> 06:00.694
which means you're doing
a lot of online advertising.

06:00.694 --> 06:03.797
So tell us what your cost
to acquire these revenues are,

06:03.797 --> 06:05.065
what your
gross margins are,

06:05.065 --> 06:06.766
and what your
net margins are.

06:06.766 --> 06:10.237
Yeah, so we spend about 20%
of our revenue on advertising.

06:10.237 --> 06:11.204
Okay, that's not bad.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.807
It costs us a blended CAC
of $16.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.576
The average order value
is around $57.

06:16.576 --> 06:17.911
Okay.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.746
Wow. And they order one a kit
or more than one kit?

06:19.746 --> 06:21.381
So that's about two kits.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.016
Then you're making
a lot of money.

06:23.016 --> 06:27.988
So 86% gross margin,
32% net margin lifetime,

06:27.988 --> 06:29.556
and 38% year to date.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.857
Great margins.

06:30.857 --> 06:33.293
So why do you need $250,000?
I mean, you're killing it.

06:33.293 --> 06:34.661
We're here
for three reasons.

06:34.661 --> 06:37.831
We're here for licensing,
wholesale, and mentorship.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.299
When it comes to licensing,

06:39.299 --> 06:40.834
when a customer
finishes the kit,

06:40.834 --> 06:43.036
the first thing they think is,
"I need to get another kit."

06:43.036 --> 06:44.738
And then
they start asking us,

06:44.738 --> 06:47.140
"Where's Baby Yoda? Do you have
any Disney characters?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.608
Where are
the Marvel characters at?"

06:48.608 --> 06:50.810
Guys, how did you arrive
at your valuation

06:50.810 --> 06:51.845
that you presented?

06:51.845 --> 06:54.214
Adrian: We know our valuation
is very low.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.548
Low?
It's low because --

06:55.548 --> 06:56.683
Yeah.
It's very low because

06:56.683 --> 06:59.252
we are here to make a deal.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.656
We can learn so much from this
group of people in this room,

07:02.656 --> 07:05.258
and the way we see it,
we have two huge opportunities

07:05.258 --> 07:06.459
ahead of us.

07:06.459 --> 07:08.228
We haven't even begun
to talk about wholesale,

07:08.228 --> 07:09.629
but licensing and wholesale

07:09.629 --> 07:11.698
we think can drive this brand
to the next level.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.066
You want to
go to retail?

07:13.066 --> 07:14.668
We want to go to retail.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.769
Why
when you're killing it?

07:15.769 --> 07:17.337
'Cause they have enough
margin. Yeah.

07:17.337 --> 07:19.072
We've -- We've done
a test order.

07:19.072 --> 07:22.676
So now we get a little
more about what -- what
the mission really is.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.478
Is the basis or the mechanism
for that learning,

07:25.478 --> 07:28.715
in your vision,
always gonna be crochet?

07:28.715 --> 07:32.385
Meaning is the next product
that you have coming,

07:32.385 --> 07:34.721
a non-crochet
or some other form?

07:34.721 --> 07:36.423
Yes, the -- the key
to our business

07:36.423 --> 07:37.991
is the "learn to" part.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.726
What we apply it to
can change.

07:39.726 --> 07:43.029
But right now, we are 100%
focused on crochet.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.365
So for the foreseeable future,
it's crochet kits.

07:45.365 --> 07:46.399
Justine:
Exactly, yep.

07:46.399 --> 07:47.734
I like this deal, okay?

07:47.734 --> 07:51.371
'Cause it has something
I love called cash flow.

07:51.371 --> 07:52.706
What does it have?
I love cash flow.

07:52.706 --> 07:55.108
And so, I see
it this way.

07:55.108 --> 07:59.346
I think I can reduce your costs
of acquiring customers

07:59.346 --> 08:01.414
by around 8% to 10%.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.117

help with licensing.

08:04.117 --> 08:06.820

very expensive.

not that bad.

my house.

24:36.542 --> 24:39.178
I was a contractor
for 20 years.

24:39.178 --> 24:41.814
I went to culinary school
back in the early '90s.

24:41.814 --> 24:45.217
I was a sous chef in a -- in a
couple big banquet kitchens

24:45.217 --> 24:47.419
and country clubs,
but I got burnt out,

24:47.419 --> 24:49.188
and that's how I got
into contracting.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.490
As a contractor,
I found a problem

24:51.490 --> 24:52.725
with straight
shut-off valves.

24:52.725 --> 24:55.761
I invented a wrench
that has over 800 positions,

24:55.761 --> 24:57.396
and I have
two utility patents

24:57.396 --> 24:59.465
and I think five
design patents on it.

24:59.465 --> 25:01.066
And I ended up
licensing it.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.202
And then Brian's like, "I want
to start inventing, too.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.770
This is really cool."
And I'm like,

25:04.770 --> 25:06.071
"Okay, well, let's do it."
Yeah, it was that easy, right?

25:06.071 --> 25:08.107
We're gonna invent our way
into chicken suits.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.375
Right.

25:09.375 --> 25:12.044
We've invented personally
together six products,

25:12.044 --> 25:14.413
four in the barbecue industry,
two in the pet industry.

25:14.413 --> 25:15.614
And then he's got
a wrench.

25:15.614 --> 25:17.816
Before this product,
did you make any money?

25:17.816 --> 25:19.451
Not a dime.

well, on our last order,

MSRP is $14.99.

come from our website alone.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.390
Well, after I use the needle,
I put it in here?

33:12.390 --> 33:15.861
Yes. So you just pop this top
open like this.

33:15.861 --> 33:17.662
And then it can close.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.832
And you can open it
and close it multiple times.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.501
Once it's filled,

33:22.501 --> 33:25.337
then you want to take
that little latch at the top,

33:25.337 --> 33:28.673
stick it in that compartment,
and then it locks permanently,

33:28.673 --> 33:30.775
and then you can
discard it appropriately.

33:30.775 --> 33:33.812
So this is the disposable
aspect of the needles.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.515
Yes.
But does only one
come with your kit?

33:36.515 --> 33:38.650
I would think you'd be
using these like crazy.

33:38.650 --> 33:42.220
So, yes, we actually
offer them in bundles.

33:42.220 --> 33:45.790
So you could buy it for one,
three, or five on my website.

33:45.790 --> 33:47.592
And we just received

33:47.592 --> 33:50.262
a major purchase order
from a large retailer,

33:50.262 --> 33:53.498
and they will be sold
in a bundle pack of four.

33:53.498 --> 33:55.600
There are other Dopp kits
for injectables, right?

33:55.600 --> 33:56.935
'Cause I've seen
plenty of them.

33:56.935 --> 33:58.403
Yes.
And so you just

33:58.403 --> 34:00.405
made them more fashionable
and more fashion looking?

34:00.405 --> 34:02.574
Correct.
And same with the sharps.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.009
Absolutely.
Okay.

34:04.009 --> 34:06.077
What was missing
from the other kits?

34:06.077 --> 34:07.546
And is it
what Mark said?

34:07.546 --> 34:10.148
Right, right.
You just made it
more fashionable and cool?

34:10.148 --> 34:14.286
What was missing was
the effect that it was daunting

34:14.286 --> 34:16.454
to take the injection
for me.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.422
Even though I'm a nurse,
I've been a nurse

34:18.422 --> 34:20.225
for the past 11 years,

34:20.225 --> 34:23.527
I realized that, yes,
I give injections every day,

34:23.527 --> 34:25.864
but when I was watching
the YouTube videos online

34:25.864 --> 34:27.632
of my community
taking these injections,

34:27.632 --> 34:30.969
I was realizing how much anxiety
was bri-- it was bringing them.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.137
Sure.

34:32.137 --> 34:34.072
And once I created something
that organized

34:34.072 --> 34:36.675
everything for them,
they weren't all over the place.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.743
I want to bring an experience
to the user.

34:38.743 --> 34:40.645
I want them to feel good
about themselves.

34:40.645 --> 34:43.547
And this brings happiness
to my community,

34:43.547 --> 34:45.216
and that's what
I'm trying to do here.

34:45.216 --> 34:47.819
How do you reach your community?
How do you sell the product?

34:47.819 --> 34:50.255
So I sell the product
all through e-commerce,

34:50.255 --> 34:53.592
and I've just been growing
organically through influencer.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.360
And now would be
a good time to ask you,

34:55.360 --> 34:56.628
how much
have you sold?

34:56.628 --> 34:59.931
Year to date, currently,
we're at $110,000.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.232
That's good.
Herjavec: And last year,

35:01.232 --> 35:02.033
what did you do,
Braxton?

35:02.033 --> 35:04.135
We did $147,000.

35:04.135 --> 35:06.371
So we're up 40%
currently right now.

35:06.371 --> 35:08.773
What does this cost to make,
and what do you sell it for?

35:08.773 --> 35:12.877
Okay, so the one that you have
costs $5.80 for me,

35:12.877 --> 35:16.047
and then I sell it
for $34.

35:16.047 --> 35:17.115
$34?

35:17.115 --> 35:18.516
Greiner:
That's a big margin.

35:18.516 --> 35:20.819
On the sharp stuff, what
your cost is for one of these?

35:20.819 --> 35:22.921
Fleming: Okay.
And what you're gonna sell

35:22.921 --> 35:24.589
the one, three, and four pack,
I guess.

35:24.589 --> 35:29.861
Okay, so if we buy over
10,000 pieces of that,

35:29.861 --> 35:31.630
it's at 28 cents,

35:31.630 --> 35:35.200
and then we sell them
for $4 on the website.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.435
And then if you buy
a pack of five, it's $15.

35:37.435 --> 35:39.137
And what are you gonna
sell it for wholesale

35:39.137 --> 35:40.238
to the retailer?

35:40.238 --> 35:42.340
So I sell it
to them for $7.50,

35:42.340 --> 35:44.676
and then they're reselling it
for $14.99.

35:44.676 --> 35:48.179
So $7.50 for a pack of four.
And it cost you 28 cents?

35:48.179 --> 35:49.414
Yes. Thank you.

35:49.414 --> 35:50.949
Herjavec: Mark's gonna
start selling them.

35:50.949 --> 35:52.450
Braxton, can you tell us
a little bit about

35:52.450 --> 35:54.519
yourself
and your background?

35:54.519 --> 35:55.854
Absolutely. Absolutely.

35:55.854 --> 35:58.890
So I actually come from
two entrepreneurial parents,

35:58.890 --> 36:01.259
and as I was growing up,

36:01.259 --> 36:04.229
I was very accepted
in my family.

36:04.229 --> 36:06.331
You know, my parents loved me.
They never judged me.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.166
They let me be
whoever I wanted to be.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.368
And at the age of
27 years old, I said,

36:10.368 --> 36:12.437
"Something is missing
from my life."

36:12.437 --> 36:15.006
And that's when I realized
that I was transgender.

36:15.006 --> 36:18.877
And once I made that change,
as I was watching

36:18.877 --> 36:21.479
YouTube videos of other
trans men taking

36:21.479 --> 36:24.049
hormone replacement injections,
that's how I realized

36:24.049 --> 36:25.650
that there was
a need for this.

36:25.650 --> 36:28.820
And I was indirectly
assessing them

36:28.820 --> 36:30.889
with my nursing skills, saying,
"Oh, that's not safe."

36:30.889 --> 36:32.290
Like, they're putting it
in shoe boxes,

36:32.290 --> 36:34.025
they're putting it
in plastic bags.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.161
And that's when I said,
"You know, I really want

36:36.161 --> 36:39.864
to become a part of my community
because they've given me so much

36:39.864 --> 36:41.766
that I wanted to give back."

36:41.766 --> 36:44.669
I created this brand,
and it just blew up.

36:44.669 --> 36:46.471
Is it just you
running the business?

36:46.471 --> 36:47.839
It's all me.
I do everything.

36:47.839 --> 36:50.041
I literally work out
of my basement right now.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.810
I have all my product
down there.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.112
Are you still doing this
completely out of your basement?

36:54.112 --> 36:55.246
Yes. 100%.

36:55.246 --> 36:57.015
And are you nursing
still, or...?

36:57.015 --> 36:59.484
Yes, I've actually been trying
to slow down

36:59.484 --> 37:01.753
because I've been putting
more effort into the business.

37:01.753 --> 37:03.788
I'm just curious,
the logo,

37:03.788 --> 37:05.356
Stealth Bros and Co.

37:05.356 --> 37:06.858
Yes.
When you came out here,

37:06.858 --> 37:08.093
I thought --
Cuban: It's a great name now.

37:08.093 --> 37:10.662
Now that we know
and understand it, it's great.

37:10.662 --> 37:12.263
I'll explain the name.

37:12.263 --> 37:14.866
Stealth is because
I wanted people to be able

37:14.866 --> 37:16.601
to keep their
medication discreet.

37:16.601 --> 37:17.635
No, I get
the stealth part.

37:17.635 --> 37:19.404
Why the Bros and Co.
and the swords?

37:19.404 --> 37:21.306
And Bros is, we're built
on the foundation

37:21.306 --> 37:23.842
of the brotherhood of F-to-M --
female to male brotherhood.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.110
I see.

37:25.110 --> 37:27.979
And then "& Co."
is & communities

37:27.979 --> 37:29.814
that we keep,
our allied communities.

37:29.814 --> 37:31.449
That's great.
And then the swords

37:31.449 --> 37:34.152
are there for because
iron sharpens iron,

37:34.152 --> 37:36.488
and more than one community
coming together

37:36.488 --> 37:38.323
makes you better and stronger,
and that what --

37:38.323 --> 37:40.458
Do you have that up on your
website, the explanation?

37:40.458 --> 37:42.060
I actually do not.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.394
You should. It's cool.
I should. Thank you.

37:43.394 --> 37:44.529
You should.
That's very cool.

37:44.529 --> 37:45.730
And there should be
a video there

37:45.730 --> 37:47.932
of you explaining it
because the power

37:47.932 --> 37:49.400
of how you
just explained it...

37:49.400 --> 37:50.535
Yes.
Yeah.

37:50.535 --> 37:52.537
...that comes across
very, very well.

37:52.537 --> 37:53.705
Thank you.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.908
I think that it's kind of
the -- the perfect kit,

37:56.908 --> 37:59.077
and I love what you're doing
for the community.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.446
I don't think
you need a partner.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.915
I don't always say that.
I rarely say it.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.416
I think
you should run this.

38:05.416 --> 38:07.085
I think you should take
all the profit.

38:07.085 --> 38:09.220
And I think you should
grow step by step.

38:09.220 --> 38:10.755
And you're gonna have
a wonderful business

38:10.755 --> 38:12.290
and reap what you sow.

38:12.290 --> 38:15.994
And for those reasons, I wish
you good luck, but I'm out.

38:16.728 --> 38:17.962
Thank you, Lori.
I appreciate it.

38:17.962 --> 38:20.799
So, Braxton, the greatest
part of your business,

38:20.799 --> 38:22.700
not to diminish the other
parts of your business,

38:22.700 --> 38:23.868
is really you.
Thank you.

38:23.868 --> 38:27.005
I mean, you exude
an incredible warmth.

38:27.005 --> 38:28.139
Thank you.

38:28.139 --> 38:30.809
And personality
that draws people to you.

38:30.809 --> 38:31.843
Thank you.

38:31.843 --> 38:34.412
I think you've got
a good business.

38:34.412 --> 38:36.714
Just at the size
you are right now,

38:36.714 --> 38:38.349
just not something
for me.

38:38.349 --> 38:39.851
I'm out.
I wish you all the best.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.619
Thank you.
Thank you.

38:41.619 --> 38:43.955
Corcoran: I've had some
personal experience.

38:43.955 --> 38:45.023
When I was trying
to get pregnant,

38:45.023 --> 38:46.891
I was doing in-vitro
for seven years

38:46.891 --> 38:48.660
to give birth to
my first born.
Wow.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.195
Thank God it worked.
Wow.

38:50.195 --> 38:51.462
God bless you.

38:51.462 --> 38:53.431
I remember being
in business meetings,

38:53.431 --> 38:54.833
in museums...
Yes.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.869
...in theaters where
it's time to take my big shot.

38:57.869 --> 38:59.437
Right.
It was just as big as this.

38:59.437 --> 39:00.939
Yeah.
With a big plunger.

39:00.939 --> 39:02.507
And it was made of oil
that burned when it went in.

39:02.507 --> 39:03.541
That's right.
It was horrible.

39:03.541 --> 39:04.609
Yeah.

39:04.609 --> 39:07.278
But the ingenious ways
I had to come up with

39:07.278 --> 39:08.913
just to hide that.

39:08.913 --> 39:10.081
Not that I was ashamed,

39:10.081 --> 39:11.449
but what do you do with
the damn needle?

39:11.449 --> 39:13.751
Right, right.
You know, my life had to go on.

39:13.751 --> 39:16.154
I used to carry
books with me,

39:16.154 --> 39:19.991
cut out pages in the middle,
cut a page, like a spot.

39:19.991 --> 39:20.959
Wow.
And carry the book

39:20.959 --> 39:22.093
and stick
the needles in there.

39:22.093 --> 39:23.795
Because you can't dispose
in a restroom.

39:23.795 --> 39:25.563
You can't throw it
in a garbage can.

39:25.563 --> 39:27.332
But let me
tell you something.

39:27.332 --> 39:30.201
You have genuine warmth
and love

39:30.201 --> 39:31.636
that your pitch
comes from.

39:31.636 --> 39:33.071
Thank you.
You feel it all over.

39:33.071 --> 39:34.172
And you know what?

39:34.172 --> 39:36.274
I'm a believer,
if you're that sincere...

39:36.274 --> 39:38.109
Yes.
...and you come from
that love spot...

39:38.109 --> 39:39.944
Yes.
...people always do well.

39:39.944 --> 39:42.814
And they buy. They just buy.
It's like a magic wand.

39:42.814 --> 39:45.016
And I think it's terrific
what you do.

39:45.016 --> 39:47.118
Thank you so much, Barbara.
Thank you.

39:47.118 --> 39:48.820
So I'm gonna
make you an offer.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.521
♪♪

40:00.331 --> 40:02.100
♪♪

40:02.100 --> 40:05.203
Narrator: Two Sharks are out,
and Barbara seems interested

40:05.203 --> 40:09.474
in Braxton's medical Dopp kit
company Stealth Bros & Co.

40:09.474 --> 40:11.309
Corcoran: I think
it's terrific what you do.

40:11.309 --> 40:13.544
Thank you so much, Barbara.
Thank you.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.647
I'm gonna make you
an offer...
Okay.

40:15.647 --> 40:18.349
...of $200,000, but I don't want
to put in all cash.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.985
I'm gonna give you
$100,000 in a credit line,

40:20.985 --> 40:22.820
$100,000 cash.
Okay.

40:22.820 --> 40:25.056
And I do want 20%
of the business

40:25.056 --> 40:27.558
'cause I want to feel happy
when you do well and make money.

40:27.558 --> 40:30.261
So I'd like to be part
of that celebration with you.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.629
Yes.
Yeah.

40:31.629 --> 40:32.797
I-I think it has merit.

40:32.797 --> 40:34.866
I think you
have made something

40:34.866 --> 40:36.734
much more fashionable
and interesting to own.

40:36.734 --> 40:37.635
I get it.

40:37.635 --> 40:38.770
Barbara, do you want
any help?

40:38.770 --> 40:39.938
Or you want to
do it yourself?

40:39.938 --> 40:41.539
You want to jump in?
I think it's a good cause.

40:41.539 --> 40:42.740
Yeah, I'll split it with you
if you want.

40:42.740 --> 40:43.975
Yeah. Okay.

40:43.975 --> 40:45.343
I like the fact
you know your numbers.

40:45.343 --> 40:47.111
Right.
But it's not a product

40:47.111 --> 40:48.680
that's gonna fit for me.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.014
Okay.
But I wish you the best.

40:50.014 --> 40:51.749
You're a good guy.
The presentation was very good.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.117
Thank you, Kevin.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.486
I'm out, but you do have
an offer from a Sharkette.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.722
And Mark is still,
I believe.

40:57.722 --> 41:00.258
No, I'm -- I'm very interested,
and Barb and I were talking.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.526
From an operational
perspective,

41:01.526 --> 41:02.994
it's not just
a cash issue.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.662
It's building your
business issue, as well.

41:04.662 --> 41:05.663
Yes, it is.

41:05.663 --> 41:06.931
Because you're
doing it yourself,

41:06.931 --> 41:09.801
trying to scale it from
the basement to a business...

41:09.801 --> 41:11.469
Correct.
...is going to be
a lot of work,

41:11.469 --> 41:13.571
and I think between
our two organizations,

41:13.571 --> 41:16.074
we -- we can complement each
other to get you there.
Absolutely.

41:16.074 --> 41:19.043
And so if it works with you,
Barb and I will split it.

41:19.043 --> 41:23.948
So it's going to be $200,000,
$100,000 of that in cash,

41:23.948 --> 41:26.985
and $100,000 of that
as a line of credit for 20%.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.020
What do you think,
Braxton?

41:29.020 --> 41:31.155
Wow. That's amazing.

41:31.155 --> 41:32.490
What do you think?

41:32.490 --> 41:34.625
Um...

41:36.327 --> 41:38.029
It wouldn't be right
if I didn't counter.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.832
So, are you guys willing
to go to 18%?

41:44.836 --> 41:46.471
Well...

41:49.440 --> 41:50.408
You guys got a deal.

41:50.408 --> 41:52.110
-You got it.
-Oh, yes!

41:52.110 --> 41:54.712
Congratulations!
Thank you so much.

It's such a pleasure, Mark.
Thank you so much.

Appreciate it.

41:57.982 --> 41:59.384

42:02.854 --> 42:05.023
Cuban: Congrats.
Thank you.
This was a pleasure.

42:05.023 --> 42:07.091
Fleming: I'm so excited.

42:07.091 --> 42:09.093
I-I cannot believe that
I just secured a deal

42:09.093 --> 42:10.428
with Mark and Barbara.

42:10.428 --> 42:11.562
I'm just like...

42:11.562 --> 42:13.698
Oh, my God. I just...

42:15.633 --> 42:18.136
I prayed so hard for this.
