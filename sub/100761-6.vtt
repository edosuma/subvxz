WEBVTT

00:15.349 --> 00:18.352
Okay, so today is important.
And we have to make a good impression.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.728
So, you know...

00:20.145 --> 00:22.606
-What?
-Maybe just don't do your jokes.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.275
What do you mean?
People like it. It's disarming.

00:25.359 --> 00:29.780
It's not, Jason.
It's arming. It's very, very arming.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.989
Don't be daft.

00:32.198 --> 00:34.326
"Therapeutic reparenting."

00:34.409 --> 00:38.038
Well, we didn't exactly nail babysitting,
so maybe we need this.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.457
"Healing and growing together."

00:40.541 --> 00:43.335
When I was learning to ride a bike,
my dad taped both of my feet to the pedals

00:43.418 --> 00:44.670
and said, "If you stop, you crash."

00:44.753 --> 00:47.464
We're gonna need to channel out
that bit of your personality for today.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.675
-What bit?
-The bit that makes you roll your eyes

00:49.758 --> 00:51.301
when you hear something therapy-y.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.928
-I don't do that.
-You do.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.430
And I know you think
you're this straight-shooting,

00:55.514 --> 00:57.474
just "tell it as it is" guy,

00:57.558 --> 01:00.602
but sometimes it does veer
into grumpy old man.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.313
-Hiya, you all right? Hi.
-Hi, how you doing?

01:03.397 --> 01:04.730
Are you being serious?

01:05.357 --> 01:06.525
"The modern world."

01:06.608 --> 01:08.944
"Why are there
so many different bins now?"

01:09.027 --> 01:11.280
"When did police sirens get so loud?"

01:11.363 --> 01:13.407
"Why does no one
know how to read maps anymore?"

01:13.490 --> 01:17.327
I stand by all of that.
Bins are out of control.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.079
Hiya, you all right? Hi.

01:25.961 --> 01:27.546
-Hello.
-All right?

01:27.629 --> 01:30.674
-I've come for your precious item.
-Oh, yeah, of course.

01:30.757 --> 01:32.342
It's a little exercise to remind us

01:32.426 --> 01:34.469
how hard it is to lose something
we're attached to.

01:34.553 --> 01:35.596
Okay.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.017
-Elvis Costello.
-Oh, yes.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.894
-It's signed.
-Yes, in it goes.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.103
-Okay.
-Thank you.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.231
So, how do you feel?

01:46.315 --> 01:48.609
-Fine. You all right?
-Not upset at all?

01:49.610 --> 01:50.903
No, no.

01:51.445 --> 01:53.989
Would you say you have a problem
making attachments?

01:54.406 --> 01:57.451
Oh, no. No, I just know
you're gonna give it back.

01:57.534 --> 01:59.912
We like you to try and imagine
it's being thrown away.

01:59.995 --> 02:03.457
But it's obviously not though, is it?
Denise just put her diabetes medicine in.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.626
I mean, no offense.
It's just not really realistic, is it?

02:05.709 --> 02:08.503
-Like I say, it's just a little exercise.
-Okay.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.297
-Okay?
-Cool, cool.

02:11.131 --> 02:14.343
Hello. I've come for your precious items.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.427
What?

02:33.403 --> 02:34.738
Okay!

02:36.198 --> 02:40.661
Welcome, friends, to the first of your
mandatory adoption training classes.

02:40.744 --> 02:44.665
Right off the top, I wanna say thank you
for making the decision to adopt.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.917
It's the greatest thing you'll ever do.

02:47.793 --> 02:50.963
Okay, so let's start by looking
at the sort of issues

02:51.046 --> 02:55.133
you'll likely be dealing with,
including, but not limited to:

02:55.217 --> 02:58.804
reactive attachment disorder,
disinhibited attachment disorder,

02:58.887 --> 03:01.431
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,

03:01.515 --> 03:03.600
pervasive developmental disorder,

03:03.684 --> 03:05.644
post-traumatic stress disorder,

03:05.727 --> 03:08.146
neglect, fetal alcohol syndrome,

03:08.230 --> 03:10.482
generalized anxiety disorder,

03:10.566 --> 03:11.817
conduct disorder,

03:11.900 --> 03:14.695
and severe emotional trauma.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.450
But first, a few words from Christine
on oppositional defiant disorder.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.247
Hi.

03:25.998 --> 03:30.961
So, it was on the third day

03:31.044 --> 03:34.298
when my son hit me for the first time.

03:42.764 --> 03:46.018
And is there anything you'd like to say
to Kwame, Luke?

03:48.103 --> 03:51.565
I suppose I want him to know
that I hear him.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.776
Then why don't you tell him?
He's right there.

03:57.279 --> 03:58.572
I hear you.

03:59.656 --> 04:03.285
-And I hear you.
-That's all I've ever wanted.

04:04.620 --> 04:05.787
I love you.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.749
I love you too.

04:12.044 --> 04:14.338
-That's so nice.
-So lovely.

04:14.796 --> 04:18.425
And that's what you get
when you meet fear with love.

04:18.884 --> 04:21.803
The magic happens.
Well done, guys. Brilliant.

04:21.887 --> 04:24.306
Okay, Nikki and Jason,
let's get on up here.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.434
-Bloody hell. Look out.
-Lizzie, hit us.

04:27.518 --> 04:31.563
"Your son has been sent home from school
for punching another boy in the face.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.982
How would you talk to him
about the incident?"

04:34.066 --> 04:35.234
Okay, let's jump in.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.110
Love a bit of role play.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.195
Are we getting chairs?

04:39.363 --> 04:41.198
Shall I get a--
Shall I get a chair, Lloyd?

04:42.407 --> 04:43.575
Lloyd, I'll stand up.

04:49.331 --> 04:51.083
-Okay, honey--
-Piss off.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.167
Oi, not acceptable.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.087
What? Was that--

04:55.170 --> 04:57.756
So when you come in hard,
there's nowhere to go.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.758
-So, moderate.
-Okay.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.261
-You mustn't hit other kids, mate.
-No, so-- Hold on. Sorry.

05:02.344 --> 05:04.930
So, we're just automatically
believing the other kid?

05:05.013 --> 05:07.683
-Lizzie just said it on her little--
-Kids lie. He probably didn't even do it.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.934
-Did you do it?
-No!

05:09.017 --> 05:11.228
Well, he's just saying that
'cause you said he didn't, but...

05:11.311 --> 05:13.021
Okay, why don't you--

05:15.899 --> 05:18.694
-Okay, why don't we talk--
-Piss off, you're not my real dad.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.821
-Okay, that seems a bit--
-Remember your emotional pathways.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.614
-Right, okay. Let's just--
-Piss off!

05:22.698 --> 05:25.033
-Oi!
-Don't raise your voice. You'll scare him.

05:25.117 --> 05:27.286
-It seems like he can handle himself.
-He clearly feels stressed.

05:27.369 --> 05:28.745
Yeah, well, I'm not super relaxed.

05:29.580 --> 05:30.622
Go on.

05:32.958 --> 05:36.044
Everything's gonna be okay. We love you.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.755
You're safe here,
and you're not going anywhere.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.925
That's good. Maintain that relationship.
Show me the love.

05:43.093 --> 05:47.264
Why don't we have a cookie, and we can
chat about why you did that thing?

05:47.347 --> 05:49.766
Maybe because every time he does it,
you give him a cookie?

05:49.850 --> 05:52.227
-Punishing isn't teaching.
-No, it isn't.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.062
Yeah, but if he's punched someone, then...

05:54.855 --> 05:56.732
-Go on. No, it's all right.
-No, go on. Please.

05:56.815 --> 06:00.485
Well, look, I get that these kids
have had a rough time, right?

06:00.569 --> 06:03.530
But if we'd done something wrong as kids,
then we'd be punished for it, wouldn't we?

06:03.614 --> 06:05.824
So, are we helping him
by treating him any differently?

06:05.908 --> 06:08.327
-These kids are different.
-I know.

06:08.410 --> 06:10.162
But when we mess up as adults,

06:10.245 --> 06:14.625
we don't get offered
a healing circle thing, do we?

06:15.083 --> 06:18.212
Life is tough.
Shouldn't we prepare 'em for that?

06:22.883 --> 06:25.219
-Have you ever had your heart broken?
-Yeah, but I mean...

06:26.887 --> 06:29.556
Try it when you're two.

06:30.516 --> 06:33.060
The hardest thing that's ever gonna
happen to these kids

06:33.143 --> 06:35.312
happened before they learned to talk.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.814
Trust me, they know how tough life is.

06:39.024 --> 06:40.776
What they need is love.

06:43.862 --> 06:44.696
Is that it?

06:44.780 --> 06:47.074
Okay. So, who's next?

06:47.157 --> 06:49.868
Jamie and Zareen, get on with me.

06:49.952 --> 06:52.329
-Okay, Luke, hit us.
-Hey, what are you doing? It's d--

06:53.121 --> 06:55.666
"Your child
is in the middle of a video game.

06:55.749 --> 06:58.669
You tell them it's time for bed,
but they ignore you.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.045
What will you do?"

07:01.547 --> 07:03.507
-Now, look--
-Piss off!

07:04.758 --> 07:05.884
What did I say?

07:06.593 --> 07:09.471
-I know. I'm sorry.
-We're being assessed the whole time.

07:09.847 --> 07:12.558
-I know.
-Try and be a bit more sensitive

07:12.641 --> 07:15.894
and a bit less talk bloody radio.

07:15.978 --> 07:19.231
All right. Okay, can we just make sure
that we sit together because...

07:19.314 --> 07:21.275
Hiya. Do you mind if I sit here?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.656
This buffet's amazing.
There's half-baguettes up there.

07:29.658 --> 07:30.909
Lloyd's fit, isn't he?

07:32.202 --> 07:34.872
-Yeah?
-Yeah, I know what you mean.

07:34.955 --> 07:38.166
I think it's 'cause he cares.
Like, compassion's so hot.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.795
He's the kinda guy that makes you
never want to eat bread again.

07:44.464 --> 07:48.302
I was wondering,
can we all keep in touch after this?

07:48.385 --> 07:49.595
-Is that weird?
-No.

07:49.678 --> 07:51.805
It'd be nice to have someone there
who's going through it all.

07:51.889 --> 07:53.807
-Of course.
-Everyone I know is having their own kids,

07:53.891 --> 07:56.143
and they don't really get it, you know?

07:56.226 --> 07:58.645
Last week, someone asked me
how much the kid was gonna cost.

07:58.729 --> 08:01.648
-Oh, my God. What did you say?
-I said ten grand.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.444
Might start a crowdfunding page.
Go to the Algarve.

08:05.527 --> 08:06.528
Yeah, all right.

08:07.112 --> 08:10.532
You don't think it's as bad as all that,
do you? All that stuff about the kids.

08:10.616 --> 08:14.369
No, they're just giving us
a worst-case scenario, I think.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.999
Sorry. You're right.
It's not as bad as that.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.334
Yeah.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.377
It's much worse.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.714
I've sort of withdrawn
from the new parents I know.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.884
-I mean, I love them.
-You got the friend-vy. It's a thing.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.178
Yeah. And, oh, my God, the photos.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.263
It's like,
I know what your baby looks like.

08:33.347 --> 08:35.182
It looks like a baby.
I don't need to come over.

08:35.265 --> 08:37.308
I'll imagine a baby.
It will look like that.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.852
And when they tell you
to support the neck, and I'm like,

08:39.937 --> 08:41.563
"I know you have to support the neck.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.273
Everyone knows
you have to support the neck."

08:43.357 --> 08:45.734
Yeah. I mean,
I think we can stop saying that now.

08:46.527 --> 08:49.029
I'm fortunate, though,
'cause I've got my sister,

08:49.112 --> 08:51.907
and I can relate to her
'cause she's had bad luck with kids.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.492
-Oh, sorry.
-Oh, okay.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.787
No, I mean, she's got some.
They're just all awful.

08:59.331 --> 09:03.627
We adopted a five-year-old.
Six months later, we had to give him back.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.046
-Why? What happened?
-Just wouldn't attach.

09:06.129 --> 09:09.049
Verbal abuse from day one,
physical not long after.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.968
Neighbors called the police in the end.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.554
I said,
"I need to report a missing person.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.347
I haven't seen the social worker
in six months."

09:16.640 --> 09:18.058
Sorry. So, why are you doing it again?

09:18.976 --> 09:23.730
"Let us not become weary in doing good,
for we shall reap a harvest."

09:23.814 --> 09:24.815
Galatians.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.443
I couldn't do any of this
if Jesus wasn't by my side.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.658
Doesn't really sound like he is.

09:42.374 --> 09:45.878
I mean, I hear all that stuff,
and I'm scared to adopt one.

09:45.961 --> 09:49.339
-She hears it, she wants to adopt two.
-Mate, it's a scary business.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.009
You never feel less capable
than when you're holding your own child.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.343
But you don't regret having kids?

09:54.595 --> 09:58.265
My kids are... tiny little vampires

09:58.348 --> 10:01.476
that suck every ounce of energy,
spark and drive out of me

10:01.560 --> 10:03.979
until I'm nothing
but an empty gray carcass.

10:04.646 --> 10:07.107
-Good pep talk.
-You know, I have this fantasy.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.944
I'm out walking one day,
and I get stabbed.

10:11.028 --> 10:15.365
Lower lateral quadrant of the abdomen.
Serious, but not fatal.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.535
And then I just get left to recover
in hospital for months.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.872
In a paradise where no one
expects anything from me.

10:23.165 --> 10:25.626
-But other than that, you're all right?
-Yeah.

10:41.600 --> 10:42.935
Sorry.

10:43.018 --> 10:45.229
He put a pattern in your coffee.
I told him not to.

10:46.104 --> 10:47.105
Okay.

10:47.189 --> 10:50.275
So, there's something I need to tell you.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.736
I'm getting engaged.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.949
Oh, my God! Karen!

10:57.032 --> 11:00.202
Oh, that's amazing! To who?

11:01.078 --> 11:04.039
-Scott.
-Scott?

11:05.707 --> 11:08.669
Yeah. No, of course. Sorry.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.171
-What do you mean, "to who"?
-No, I wasn't concentrating.

11:12.381 --> 11:16.218
That's great. Kaz, I'm so pleased.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.720
-Scott.
-Thank you.

11:19.555 --> 11:21.431
So, how did he propose?

11:21.515 --> 11:26.812
Well, we just sort of talked it through
and realized the pros outweigh the cons.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.814
Cool.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.067
-So, has he picked a ring yet?
-No.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.653
He says I might as well get it
'cause I know what I want.

11:34.736 --> 11:36.321
And that way, I know I like it.

11:36.405 --> 11:39.157
Yeah, right. That makes sense.

11:41.869 --> 11:42.870
Scott.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.288
-Scott.
-Scott, yeah.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.293
Oh, for God's sake.

11:49.835 --> 11:53.130
Why is everyone so attractive now?
People didn't used to be this attractive.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.132
They're the same.
You're just getting older.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.385
I used to love looking at
attractive women. Now it's just painful.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.345
It's not real though, is it?
It's like an advert.

12:00.429 --> 12:03.098
So, you're essentially falling in love
with an advert.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.522
I slept with someone.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.441
What?

12:14.776 --> 12:16.904
-Who?
-Someone from work.

12:16.987 --> 12:18.947
She's new. She's American.

12:19.031 --> 12:21.325
-What, that one I met at the thing?
-Harper, yeah.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.659
-How old is she?
-She's 24.

12:22.743 --> 12:26.038
-Jesus, Freddy.
-Yes, she's an old 24 though.

12:26.121 --> 12:29.166
She's, you know, really present.
Mentally, she's comfortably early 30s.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.417
-Well, is it over?
-Yes.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.255
-Basically.
-Jesus, Freddy.

12:35.339 --> 12:37.925
Yeah, but she's got really clingy.
She keeps calling and texting.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.760
She hasn't developed
object permanence yet, has she?

12:39.843 --> 12:41.220
She probably panics when you leave.

12:41.303 --> 12:42.971
What were you thinking, mate?
What about Erica?

12:43.055 --> 12:44.097
Erica?

12:45.182 --> 12:47.684
Most of the time it's like
she doesn't even like me anymore.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.436
Get used to that feeling, mate.

12:51.605 --> 12:52.856
You have no idea.

12:53.774 --> 12:56.109
You have no idea
what it's like to have a family.

12:56.193 --> 12:59.613
You know, the things that I do.
The things that I have to hold together.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.115
Look, you don't even have a family,
yet you're thinking of bailing.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.368
-No, I'm not.
-Uh, okay.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.120
-Uh, no, I'm not.
-Okay, relax.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.289
I'm not wearing a wire.

13:12.417 --> 13:15.003
Just think very hard.
That's all I'm saying.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.296
'Cause this stuff,

13:16.380 --> 13:19.508
it's when you find out
what sort of a person you really are.

13:21.093 --> 13:23.095
Sometimes it's better not to know.

13:42.239 --> 13:44.408
Should go through
this training stuff together.

13:46.368 --> 13:50.372
There's a whole section on what type
of disability we'd be happy with.

13:50.455 --> 13:53.166
-Well, not-- not happy with.
-I was thinking maybe we could

13:53.250 --> 13:55.878
just have the night off.
Take a bit of a breather.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.254
-Take a breather?
-Yeah.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.841
Oh, okay. You mean, not for tonight?

14:00.924 --> 14:01.925
Yeah.

14:03.802 --> 14:05.637
Or, you know, just a general breather.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.432
Are you serious?

14:11.560 --> 14:12.978
What's the matter?

14:13.061 --> 14:15.105
-Nothing. Nothing.
-What's going on? Jason.

14:16.940 --> 14:18.650
It's late, all right?
I don't want to get into this now.

14:18.734 --> 14:19.735
-It's late.
-Okay. I do.

14:19.818 --> 14:20.903
Okay.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.280
Okay.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.954
I don't think it's the worst idea if we
were to slow down a little bit, all right?

14:31.038 --> 14:32.748
-Why?
-Because it feels like something

14:32.831 --> 14:36.793
-we really, really need to think about.
-Yeah, we have thought about it.

14:36.877 --> 14:39.838
'Cause it's going to affect every aspect
of the rest of our lives, Nikki.

14:39.922 --> 14:41.340
Yeah, and we decided to do it.

14:41.423 --> 14:44.885
You convinced me to do it.
It took a lot for me to do this.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.011
Me too.

14:47.763 --> 14:50.140
This last year didn't just happen to you.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.184
It happened to me as well.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.398
All right. Is this about the kids?
Because we knew the issues.

14:58.482 --> 15:01.568
We knew the issues, but when you actually
speak to someone who's going through it--

15:01.652 --> 15:03.987
You know,
so many people adopt, and it's fine.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.157
-You got the social workers telling us--
-They have to say things like that.

15:07.241 --> 15:09.326
It's for legal reasons, Jase.

15:09.910 --> 15:12.412
You know,
it's a "may contain nuts" type thing.

15:12.496 --> 15:14.414
Yeah. But what if it isn't?
You got kids here addicted to drugs.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.792
-They got alcohol dependency--
-Oh, God. So what?

15:16.875 --> 15:18.710
-I mean, so do we, basically.
-I'm being serious now.

15:18.794 --> 15:20.587
-Jase, so am I.
-Please don't joke about this.

15:20.671 --> 15:23.298
I can't believe you're freaking out on me.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.759
You're not the one who freaks out.

15:25.843 --> 15:28.136
I'm the one who freaks out,
and for once, I'm managing not to.

15:28.220 --> 15:30.639
There you go. That's it.
Own it. That's it.

15:32.516 --> 15:36.019
You're afraid of everything, so I'm
not allowed to be afraid of anything.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.897
We talked about it. We agreed to do it.
Why did you agree to it?

15:38.981 --> 15:41.108
Because I wanted to make you happy.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.902
And I knew this would make you happy.

15:43.986 --> 15:49.449
And I really, really, really
want to make you happy.

15:51.285 --> 15:54.538
-But this is a huge sacrifice.
-Yeah.

15:55.789 --> 15:59.501
That's what helping people is.
It is sacrificing.

16:01.461 --> 16:05.507
Do you know who doesn't make sacrifices?
Arseholes, Jason.

16:05.591 --> 16:07.676
Arseholes and children. Which one are you?

16:37.831 --> 16:38.832
Shit.

16:50.385 --> 16:53.222
-Alisha, are you leaving?
-College in Geneva.

16:53.305 --> 16:56.350
Oh, wow. Well, well done.
I mean, it won't be the same without you.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.434
-Don't do that.
-Okay

16:57.518 --> 16:59.311
So, do you want it?

16:59.394 --> 17:00.812
-Do I want what?
-The job.

17:00.896 --> 17:02.648
I could recommend you. You'd get it.

17:02.731 --> 17:06.443
Nah. No. I mean, it seems awful, so...

17:06.527 --> 17:08.444
Think about it. It's more money.

17:10.989 --> 17:12.532
Coming to the park?

17:13.825 --> 17:16.161
Everyone's going: students, tutors.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.457
-Oh, no, I can't really. I've got a...
-Okay, it's fine.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.877
Thank you. Oh-- Excuse me. Is this yours?

17:23.961 --> 17:26.547
-Oh, yes!
-It was in the...

17:26.630 --> 17:28.214
-Wow. Thank you.
-It's all right.

17:29.007 --> 17:30.217
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.718
-See you.
-See you.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.098
Do you know what? I will come.

17:36.557 --> 17:39.142
-Oh, great.
-Yeah.

17:39.810 --> 17:41.311
Can you wait a minute?

17:41.395 --> 17:42.771
-Sure.
-All right.

17:56.660 --> 17:57.870
Yeah. Yes.

17:57.953 --> 18:00.247
What's up, guys? How's it going? Just...

18:02.332 --> 18:03.584
-Thanks very much. Thank you.
-Thank you.

18:03.667 --> 18:04.960
What are we celebrating?

18:06.003 --> 18:08.547
Life, brother. Life.

18:08.630 --> 18:10.048
-Well, cheers, brother.
-Cheers.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.550
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

18:18.348 --> 18:21.268
-So, how long have you worked here?
-Me?

18:21.351 --> 18:22.352
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:23.478 --> 18:27.191
Gosh, about seven years.

18:27.274 --> 18:28.942
-Wow.
-Yeah.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.195
Yeah, I thought people just did this
for the summer.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.571
Not everyone, no.

18:33.739 --> 18:37.492
-And where are you from?
-Oh, you know,

18:37.576 --> 18:43.165
I've traveled around so much that I don't
really feel like I'm from anywhere.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.666
-Where were you born?
-Norwich.

18:44.750 --> 18:45.751
You're from Norwich.

18:46.960 --> 18:51.340
Look, I'm just trying to go everywhere
and do everything, dude. Aren't you?

18:51.840 --> 18:52.883
I'm old.

18:52.966 --> 18:58.514
So, I can do about three things,
and then I get really tired afterwards.

18:58.597 --> 19:00.724
Well, you better make sure
they're the right things then.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.299
Why would you do something
you don't wanna do?

19:34.383 --> 19:37.010
Because I'm a grown-up.
Not as simple as that.

19:37.094 --> 19:41.557
It is though.
You know what happiness is, ultimately?

19:41.640 --> 19:42.683
Go on.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.434
-It's dopamine. Yeah.
-Right.

19:44.518 --> 19:48.272
All human achievement
gets converted into dopamine.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.983
So, if you climb a mountain,
it's dopamine.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.402
-If you have sex, it's dopamine.
-Yeah.

19:53.485 --> 19:57.030
Win the lottery, guess what?
It's dopamine.

19:57.114 --> 20:01.034
So, my thing is,
why bother climbing a mountain

20:01.118 --> 20:04.454
when you can get your dopamine
from one of these?

20:04.538 --> 20:07.374
-Oh, bloody hell. Okay.
-It's just easier, isn't it?

20:07.457 --> 20:09.543
To hack your happiness.

20:10.878 --> 20:12.254
-Did you know...
-What?

20:12.337 --> 20:16.884
...that the same perfume
smells differently on different people?

20:17.593 --> 20:20.888
Did you know that? I mean,
think about it. That's amazing, right?

20:20.971 --> 20:23.432
-That is amazing. That is amazing, yeah.
-Crazy.

20:26.810 --> 20:29.062
-I feel so close to you, man.
-Yeah, me too.

20:30.898 --> 20:32.858
-Say if this is weird...
-Go on.

20:32.941 --> 20:36.445
...but I feel like when I die,
I wanna be buried with you, man.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.238
I think that's a great idea.

20:38.322 --> 20:41.200
Right. Okay, come on. Let's go!
Shirts versus skins!

20:41.283 --> 20:42.492
-What do you mean?
-Jason, you're skins.

20:42.576 --> 20:44.453
-What?
-Couple of skins and shirts. Come on.

20:44.536 --> 20:47.164
-What sport are we even--
-Come on. It's rounders, Jason.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.624
Come on. Let's go!

20:48.707 --> 20:50.959
-All right.
-No shirts, yo. Come on.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.629
I-- Yeah, is everyone--

20:57.049 --> 20:58.550
Do you know what,
I haven't got any sun cream.

20:58.634 --> 21:00.427
So I'm quite fair-skinned, so I might--

21:00.511 --> 21:02.262
I'll go shirts, if that--
Is that all right?

21:02.763 --> 21:04.223
-That's all right, man. Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah. Okay.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.641
Whatever. Whatever suits you.

21:09.478 --> 21:11.980
Come on, mate! Come on!

21:13.941 --> 21:15.150
Shit.

21:16.693 --> 21:18.028
Yeah, that's the hammy there.

21:18.654 --> 21:20.948
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. I do it all the time.

21:21.031 --> 21:24.785
It's just-- I've just got to...
just got to stretch it out.

21:24.868 --> 21:28.163
You should never trust a man
in his 30s who's in shape, by the way.

21:28.247 --> 21:29.831
It just means
he's got nothing else going on.

21:34.545 --> 21:35.963
Probably take the weight off.

21:37.881 --> 21:40.050
Here. Wet your whis-tle.

21:40.133 --> 21:43.053
Very good. Thank you. It's "whistle."

21:44.304 --> 21:45.305
Whis-tle.

21:45.389 --> 21:47.432
Look at me. Whistle.

21:48.517 --> 21:50.018
Whistle. Yeah?

21:50.102 --> 21:51.728
-That's it. Perfect.
-Yeah!

21:54.231 --> 21:55.274
Cool.

21:55.941 --> 22:01.154
-So, you are having a nice time?
-Ah, you're good kids.

22:03.866 --> 22:04.992
I'm not a kid.

22:09.621 --> 22:12.958
We're all going on somewhere
if you want to come.

22:15.794 --> 22:16.795
You wanna come?

22:43.864 --> 22:46.825
Oh, shit. Sorry.

22:48.744 --> 22:50.746
This work thing,
which went on and on and...

22:50.829 --> 22:52.080
That's okay.

22:53.207 --> 22:55.542
-Is everything all right?
-Yeah, yeah, fine.

22:56.460 --> 22:57.878
-You?
-Yeah.

23:07.930 --> 23:12.476
Bloody hell, Jase. Out the jar?
Like a junkie?

23:27.074 --> 23:31.119
Okay, I just-- I wanted to say one thing,
and I won't say anything else.

23:33.163 --> 23:39.002
I think that you think that you're not
a good enough person to do this.

23:41.338 --> 23:43.131
But I wanted you to know that...

23:44.675 --> 23:45.717
you are.

23:47.928 --> 23:49.096
And...

23:50.973 --> 23:53.100
Okay, well-- No, that's it, actually.

23:53.642 --> 23:55.561
Probably didn't need to turn around
to say that.

23:55.644 --> 23:57.771
That didn't take as long
as I thought it would.

23:57.855 --> 23:58.939
I'm not...

24:01.400 --> 24:03.402
as good a person as you think.

24:05.779 --> 24:07.281
Well, I like you.

24:19.501 --> 24:20.878
I'm gonna have a shower.

24:22.129 --> 24:24.756
-Now?
-Yeah. Just feel like one.
