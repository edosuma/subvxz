00:05.375 --> 00:08.666
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:13.500 --> 00:16.541
They think we're academics, not thieves.
Why are you so pessimistic?

00:16.625 --> 00:19.000
How long have you known her?
Tatiana. How long?

00:19.083 --> 00:21.166
Why does it matter? Love can't be timed!

00:22.000 --> 00:22.916
Love is to be lived.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.333
You can't risk the entire plan
for a woman.

00:25.416 --> 00:27.750
That's the first rule.
Andrés, the first rule:

00:27.833 --> 00:30.666
A job can't be poisoned
by an amorous relationship. Never.

00:30.750 --> 00:31.583
Never.

00:32.416 --> 00:34.083
It's not that hard to understand.

00:36.291 --> 00:37.333
You're so cute.

00:38.791 --> 00:41.250
A loose end, just one,
will cost us our lives in there.

00:41.333 --> 00:44.083
Inside, our lives are at risk.
You need to understand that.

00:44.166 --> 00:45.458
Dying is a possibility.

00:45.541 --> 00:47.208
-No, only if you make mistakes!
-No.

00:47.291 --> 00:49.500
No. That's the funny part.

00:50.333 --> 00:54.458
You're heading into absolute chaos
and you insist on being in control.

00:54.541 --> 00:56.625
Chaos doesn't exist in a perfect plan.

00:56.708 --> 00:59.541
For God's sake, of course chaos exists.

00:59.625 --> 01:02.916
Chaos always intrudes on life.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.916
You don't need to make mistakes
to get killed.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.541
How long do I have to live?

01:07.291 --> 01:09.541
Three years. What mistake did I make?

01:15.375 --> 01:16.583
What mistake did I make?

01:19.041 --> 01:19.875
None.

01:24.083 --> 01:24.916
It happens.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.708
And you can't prevent it.
What mistake did Dad make?

01:29.500 --> 01:32.666
-He must've made mistakes to end up dead.
-No, it's simpler than that.

01:32.750 --> 01:35.125
A police patrol that was too close.

01:35.208 --> 01:38.000
Or someone saw him enter,
or his weapon jammed.

01:38.083 --> 01:39.666
Brother, you're clever.

01:39.750 --> 01:40.750
Accident.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.041
That's life's mystery.

01:42.125 --> 01:44.791
That's why it doesn't make sense
to live like you do.

01:48.708 --> 01:50.750
-How do I live, Andrés?
-Without Tatiana.

01:51.791 --> 01:52.791
What I mean...

01:55.166 --> 01:56.083
Without enjoyment.

01:57.666 --> 02:00.541
In the end, that's the only thing
that matters.

02:01.875 --> 02:02.791
We're here.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.000
At every step.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.500
Because some day,

02:09.416 --> 02:10.916
something will go wrong.

02:12.083 --> 02:13.375
It may cost your life...

02:14.208 --> 02:15.416
or even something worse.

02:16.083 --> 02:18.041
And on that day, you can't think

02:19.208 --> 02:23.083
that you are guilty of something
you couldn't control. Do you understand?

02:25.583 --> 02:26.958
That's life.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.166
Enjoy it...

02:33.250 --> 02:34.541
until the party is over.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.375
Tamayo, I need
the Emergency Military Unit.

02:54.458 --> 02:56.166
Seville's detachment isn't enough?

02:56.250 --> 02:59.833
No, I'm in a 170-hectare forest
with 183 houses to search.

02:59.916 --> 03:03.541
Farms, huts, wells, and a search perimeter
I have to expand 20 kilometers every hour.

03:03.625 --> 03:06.375
-<i>Madrid needs to come immediately.</i>
-I'll talk with Defense. They'll go.

03:06.458 --> 03:07.291
Okay.

03:08.250 --> 03:10.833
-Suárez, let's go to those farms.
-I'll take care of it.

03:11.541 --> 03:12.375
Let's go!

03:24.583 --> 03:26.541
Marseille is on his way here.

03:27.458 --> 03:30.166
-Okay. Copy.
-<i>How are you?</i>

03:30.958 --> 03:33.000
Very scared.

03:35.541 --> 03:36.416
And very angry.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.208
<i>And surrounded by chicken shit.</i>

03:49.875 --> 03:50.833
I'm sorry, Raquel.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.625
<i>I'm very sorry. I really am.</i>

03:54.958 --> 03:56.041
<i>Look, I am...</i>

03:56.625 --> 03:58.666
I'm quite old and you're my first love.

04:00.875 --> 04:03.625
I don't know how to do this.
I don't know how to talk...

04:04.583 --> 04:06.666
about this.
I only know I need you in my life.

04:08.708 --> 04:11.208
<i>I've held on</i>
<i>to everything you've taught me.</i>

04:15.041 --> 04:16.541
Like cooking together...

04:17.541 --> 04:19.375
in our filthy boat.

04:20.916 --> 04:24.166
Swimming fully clothed in the ocean.

04:30.041 --> 04:33.458
And that Van Morrison guy is really good.
He is.

04:33.541 --> 04:34.791
<i>I really like him.</i>

04:36.208 --> 04:38.833
<i>Raquel, everything is better</i>
<i>because you're with me.</i>

04:41.458 --> 04:42.875
Because I'm in love.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.666
You could've told me before
that you were in love.

04:53.416 --> 04:56.000
I'm telling you now because I don't know
how to say it to your face.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.625
<i>Forgive me because...</i>

04:59.625 --> 05:01.041
in our earlier argument,

05:02.208 --> 05:03.541
who was really talking was...

05:04.041 --> 05:07.500
the maladjusted one who doesn't know
how to enjoy life, the Professor.

05:07.583 --> 05:09.750
<i>But Sergio, I...</i>

05:11.708 --> 05:14.083
Raquel, I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

05:24.708 --> 05:25.916
I feel really rediculous here.

05:26.916 --> 05:28.041
Crying.

05:28.125 --> 05:29.625
While a hen stares at me.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.000
Hens bring luck.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.708
I don't know where.
Definitely not in the Chinese zodiac.

05:47.375 --> 05:50.833
After what you've told me, I think
I'll be able to endure three hours.

05:56.208 --> 05:58.750
We'll talk again in 15 minutes.
Frequency 144.

05:59.833 --> 06:01.583
<i>Understood. Over and out.</i>

07:33.583 --> 07:36.458
<i>I brought that champagne bottle</i>
<i>to drink with Rio.</i>

07:41.250 --> 07:44.166
<i>While I was dancing,</i>
<i>I realized there are two kinds of people.</i>

07:44.333 --> 07:47.083
<i>The ones who break up with you</i>
<i>and need to wish you the best.</i>

07:47.166 --> 07:50.375
<i>Like, "Take care, be happy."</i>

07:56.750 --> 07:57.791
<i>Rio is one of those.</i>

07:59.833 --> 08:02.958
<i>Then there's the other kind.</i>
<i>We're a little bit more of a dick.</i>

08:09.791 --> 08:11.916
I'm sorry. If you want,
I can wait outside.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.416
No. At this point,
being shy doesn't make sense.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.208
Rio, I wanted to say...

08:22.791 --> 08:25.083
You did what we should have done
a long time ago.

08:25.166 --> 08:27.458
Hey. Not a long time ago.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.250
We had a lot of fun together.

08:30.083 --> 08:33.166
And you're fucking crazy,
but you haven't headbutted me yet.

08:36.125 --> 08:37.500
Yeah, we had our fun.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.083
Good times.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.875
But it wasn't enough.

08:50.708 --> 08:52.208
The wave swept us away.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.208
What wave, Tokyo?

08:54.291 --> 08:56.333
What fucking wave are you talking about?

08:57.166 --> 08:58.541
The robbery.

08:58.625 --> 08:59.750
The pressure.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.041
Being millionaires.

09:07.791 --> 09:08.625
Hello, Denver.

09:11.958 --> 09:13.375
I didn't hear anything.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.500
-See you later.
-Where are you going, Denver?

09:18.583 --> 09:20.500
-Don't go, don't go.
-What?

09:20.958 --> 09:23.375
Rio, did you know
I almost hooked up with Denver?

09:23.458 --> 09:25.375
Tokyo, what the fuck are you thinking?

09:25.958 --> 09:28.625
-In Toledo. At that party.
-What are you talking about?

09:29.000 --> 09:29.958
You were drunk.

09:30.833 --> 09:32.666
Yes, of course. He was drunk.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.958
You were drunk. I was drunk.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.125
No. Moscow came into the room
and ruined the moment.

09:38.541 --> 09:39.666
What I'm saying

09:40.625 --> 09:42.916
is that what we had was something casual.

09:43.791 --> 09:44.666
Anything...

09:47.166 --> 09:49.166
could have happened that day.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.250
And now I wonder the same thing you do.

09:56.583 --> 10:00.208
How could have we wasted
all this time together?

10:10.291 --> 10:11.166
Thank you.

10:23.541 --> 10:27.000
Rio, we didn't even kiss. Nothing.

10:31.666 --> 10:33.875
<i>Love is like two people on a seesaw.</i>

10:34.416 --> 10:36.666
<i>When one goes up, the other goes down.</i>

10:37.041 --> 10:38.875
<i>The balance is always fucked.</i>

10:39.166 --> 10:41.333
<i>Thanks to time, monotony,</i>

10:41.750 --> 10:43.458
<i>or because of people like me.</i>

10:43.916 --> 10:46.666
<i>The ones who only know one way</i>
<i>to get rid of pain:</i>

10:47.375 --> 10:48.333
<i>by giving it back.</i>

10:49.750 --> 10:52.041
Rio had a microphone and a GPS beacon.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.125
<i>Everything was extracted. No problem.</i>

10:54.208 --> 10:56.125
Did you isolate the chips?

10:56.625 --> 10:58.041
Of course, dear.

10:59.083 --> 11:02.708
<i>They're in the little box,</i>
<i>tuned in to the sweet sounds of sleep.</i>

11:02.791 --> 11:05.500
<i>The police have been taking notes</i>
<i>on snoring for quite a while.</i>

11:17.541 --> 11:19.291
<i>It's time to give them something else.</i>

11:20.083 --> 11:21.125
<i>Palermo.</i>

11:22.625 --> 11:24.208
Let's do the Alcatraz Plan now.

11:24.833 --> 11:26.375
<i>Maximum urgency.</i>

11:28.708 --> 11:29.750
The Alcatraz Plan?

11:30.708 --> 11:33.166
<i>Sergio, what the fuck is happening</i>
<i>out there?</i>

11:34.291 --> 11:35.416
We're in...

11:36.375 --> 11:37.458
an extreme situation.

11:44.791 --> 11:48.916
It's possible that, at some point,
Lisbon and I will be under such pressure

11:49.000 --> 11:50.416
that it could overwhelm us.

11:50.708 --> 11:53.541
We'll have the army on us.
The police as well.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.791
Things may go wrong.

11:56.458 --> 11:57.583
But, in that case,

11:58.500 --> 12:00.000
we'll have the Alcatraz Plan.

12:00.291 --> 12:02.541
If Lisbon and I see ourselves
in a critical situation,

12:02.625 --> 12:06.791
we'll need the biggest
possible distraction tactic.

12:06.875 --> 12:08.916
The objective is that the police will need

12:09.000 --> 12:13.000
to look in two places at the same time.
And there's only one thing bigger

12:13.083 --> 12:14.458
than capturing us two.

12:15.166 --> 12:16.416
Capturing us all?

12:17.875 --> 12:21.958
You escaping is the greatest bait
we can create.

12:24.416 --> 12:26.041
They'll go mad.

12:27.958 --> 12:28.833
Any news?

12:37.083 --> 12:37.916
Colonel.

12:44.041 --> 12:46.041
The seismic sensors indicate movement.

12:46.333 --> 12:49.208
It's possible they're digging
with industrial machinery.

12:55.333 --> 12:56.416
Bernardo!

12:59.708 --> 13:02.416
You've studied that subsoil
to the point of exhaustion.

13:02.500 --> 13:05.791
Tell me. Is there any possible way
they could escape through there?

13:06.291 --> 13:07.416
I would say no, sir.

13:07.958 --> 13:09.500
It's a very remote hypothesis.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.041
Remote or impossible, Bernardo?

13:13.375 --> 13:16.333
We'd be talking about an engineering job
with tunneling machines,

13:16.416 --> 13:19.125
-more than 100 meters underground.
-So, Bernardo?

13:19.208 --> 13:20.625
We can't underestimate them.

13:20.708 --> 13:23.583
They could dig the Channel Tunnel
and we wouldn't notice.

13:23.666 --> 13:26.083
-How many men are down there?
-Twenty-five men, sir.

13:26.166 --> 13:28.083
Only 25 men?
Were there budget cuts or something?

13:28.166 --> 13:31.208
Bring 50, 100 for every square meter.
I want an officer by every puddle.

13:31.291 --> 13:34.708
They can't take a step without
being spotted. Get it together, Bernardo.

13:34.791 --> 13:35.708
Yes, sir.

13:37.083 --> 13:37.916
Let's go.

13:41.041 --> 13:44.041
Bring me an expert who knows
every stone underground.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.250
I want georadar, engineers, whatever!

13:46.333 --> 13:49.125
Fuck everything! Come on!

13:58.166 --> 13:59.625
What were you doing in there?

14:01.666 --> 14:03.750
I was on a hike and I got lost, sir.

14:04.333 --> 14:06.125
I came here to rest. I'm sorry.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.708
And you hide in a chicken coop?

14:13.125 --> 14:18.583
Well, I knocked on the door to the house,
but nobody answered. Please.

14:24.750 --> 14:25.875
And those spikes?

14:27.625 --> 14:28.583
Climbing.

14:32.541 --> 14:34.208
There's no mountain here.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.750
Or ice.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.750
Do you think I'm stupid?

14:42.958 --> 14:44.000
I know who you are.

14:44.916 --> 14:46.375
Raquel Murillo.

14:50.166 --> 14:51.000
Okay.

14:53.000 --> 14:54.541
I'll tell you the truth.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.750
-Don't aim at me!
-Calm down.

14:56.833 --> 14:59.041
-Don't! Put down your gun.
-Calm down.

14:59.125 --> 15:00.041
What's your name?

15:00.125 --> 15:01.416
-Put down the gun!
-Your name.

15:01.500 --> 15:02.541
What's your name?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.208
Tell me your name.

15:05.083 --> 15:07.416
-Justino.
-Justino. Justino, calm down.

15:07.500 --> 15:09.166
Look at me.

15:09.541 --> 15:10.375
Now...

15:11.000 --> 15:13.416
you have two guns aimed at you. And you...

15:14.250 --> 15:16.750
You have a shotgun that kills birds.

15:16.833 --> 15:17.916
You can hurt me.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.083
But if you shoot me, you're dead.
So, put the weapon down.

15:23.291 --> 15:24.708
Put it down, Justino.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.083
Easy.

15:27.333 --> 15:28.541
Easy. Yes.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.458
You don't have a chance.

15:32.375 --> 15:34.375
If I were you, I wouldn't risk my life.

15:35.208 --> 15:37.500
They've asked for citizen cooperation.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.458
And they're offering ten million euros
as a reward, ma'am.

15:43.583 --> 15:44.708
Put down the guns.

16:22.583 --> 16:23.416
Okay.

16:25.625 --> 16:26.458
Okay.

16:27.541 --> 16:28.375
Okay.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.208
Don't move!

16:30.541 --> 16:31.791
-Don't move!
-Step back!

16:31.875 --> 16:32.791
Drop your weapons.

16:32.875 --> 16:34.041
-Step back!
-Calm down.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.500
Step back!

16:35.583 --> 16:36.916
-Quiet, Justino.
-Step back, I say!

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Stop it, Justino.

16:39.375 --> 16:40.500
Drop your weapons.

16:41.333 --> 16:44.375
-I know this game, you don't.
-Do you think this is a game, ma'am?

16:45.166 --> 16:47.041
You're police. I've seen you on TV.

16:48.041 --> 16:49.583
You aren't going to shoot.

16:49.666 --> 16:52.583
But we can. You've trespassed
onto our property.

16:52.666 --> 16:55.541
And you have to have great aim
with both hands.

16:56.125 --> 16:58.625
This rifle is for big-game hunting,
not for birds.

17:00.375 --> 17:01.625
This makes holes.

17:01.708 --> 17:03.083
Drop the fucking gun!

17:09.375 --> 17:10.416
Okay.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.000
Let's do something. Okay?

17:26.583 --> 17:27.458
Don't move.

17:39.833 --> 17:41.375
What if we start negotiating?

17:58.958 --> 18:00.250
Wow, so pretty.

18:02.208 --> 18:03.416
So pretty.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.333
Very pretty.

18:04.833 --> 18:08.416
Yes. And it's warm here. Look.

18:09.041 --> 18:09.875
Here it is.

18:11.666 --> 18:13.333
Hey! What are you doing?

18:13.666 --> 18:17.083
Nairobi! Nairobi!

18:18.833 --> 18:22.458
-What...
-We're both single now.

18:22.541 --> 18:23.375
I see.

18:23.458 --> 18:26.125
We can go buy kittens.

18:26.666 --> 18:27.916
Yes. What happened?

18:28.375 --> 18:30.458
Nothing. We...

18:31.041 --> 18:32.250
We broke up.

18:32.333 --> 18:34.541
-Things break. Love breaks.
-Come here.

18:34.625 --> 18:35.875
Hey, guys!

18:35.958 --> 18:39.458
-Come on.
-We came here with the cavalry...

18:39.541 --> 18:40.708
Tokyo!

18:41.541 --> 18:44.375
And then he shits all over me.

18:46.666 --> 18:47.500
The oven!

18:48.291 --> 18:49.291
-Listen to me.
-What?

18:49.750 --> 18:53.583
Go upstairs and drink some coffee.
I'll come up later so we can talk.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.916
-Not coffee, then I'll throw up.
-Yes. Then throw up.

18:57.000 --> 18:58.708
-No.
-Yes. Throw up.

18:59.291 --> 19:00.125
What?

19:00.208 --> 19:01.708
I'm going to take a bath.

19:02.291 --> 19:04.583
What bath? You're drunk as a skunk.

19:04.666 --> 19:06.875
Yes, I'm going to take a bath.

19:06.958 --> 19:11.583
I need the water
and being inside the darkness.

19:11.666 --> 19:13.875
-Floating!
-Relax!

19:13.958 --> 19:16.500
Let's go upstairs, the two of us,
so we can talk.

19:16.583 --> 19:17.708
-A little bit.
-Sure.

19:18.875 --> 19:21.958
Because you're in love
with the gang's fatty gay.

19:26.791 --> 19:27.916
But I...

19:29.250 --> 19:32.916
I had a good... love story.

19:35.125 --> 19:36.291
I'm going to take a bath.

19:38.000 --> 19:38.833
Yes.

19:42.000 --> 19:42.833
Radio!

19:45.541 --> 19:48.333
Denver. Come downstairs immediately
to pick up Tokyo.

19:48.416 --> 19:51.083
-Hello, handsome!
-Let her be. She's funnier this way.

19:51.833 --> 19:53.333
Shut your face hole, Matías.

19:53.791 --> 19:55.333
If she wants to dive, I'll teach her.

19:55.416 --> 19:57.708
Go back to work
or I'll beat the shit out of you.

19:57.791 --> 19:58.625
Okay, okay.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.333
Okay.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.500
Wow!

20:03.583 --> 20:05.958
These ovens are at 1500 degrees Celsius.

20:06.041 --> 20:08.583
-We can't babysit drunks right now.
-The alpha male.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.416
What a buffalo you are, Bogotá.

20:16.166 --> 20:19.625
-Stop messing around.
-Oh, I know.

20:19.708 --> 20:21.166
You like Nairobi.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.208
You like her ordering you around.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.125
Stop messing around.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.791
Okay. Then let's do something.

20:29.875 --> 20:34.375
If I can't swim in water,
let me swim in gold like Uncle Scrooge.

20:40.333 --> 20:42.250
Denver, you again?

20:45.166 --> 20:46.875
Denver is here again.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.166
Take her upstairs.

20:48.250 --> 20:50.083
Tokyo, what the fuck are you doing?

20:50.166 --> 20:52.958
What the fuck are you doing?
You're putting us at risk.

20:55.833 --> 20:57.625
-I'm sorry.
-You're fucking sorry?

20:58.458 --> 21:00.666
We're here because of you
and you're drunk.

21:00.750 --> 21:03.791
If you aren't going to help,
at least don't get us killed.

21:03.875 --> 21:06.708
So, fucking stop it now
because all of us have suffered.

21:11.166 --> 21:12.208
I'm pathetic.

21:15.958 --> 21:18.041
I'm not surprised he broke up with me.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.750
Listen to me.

21:25.291 --> 21:26.958
We came here to rescue Rio.

21:27.458 --> 21:29.666
Didn't we? That's why we came.

21:29.750 --> 21:31.250
Not to save your relationship.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.166
And you got it done.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.708
Because you're an amazing woman.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.583
But you need to move on.

21:43.666 --> 21:45.125
But I can't.

21:45.833 --> 21:47.083
You think you can't.

21:48.125 --> 21:49.041
But you can.

21:50.791 --> 21:51.875
Repeat after me:

21:53.125 --> 21:54.666
"I will move on

21:54.750 --> 21:56.875
-because I'm the fucking best."
-I am...

21:57.791 --> 22:00.458
No, no, no. Tokyo!

22:01.250 --> 22:03.708
-What's up with you?
-I don't know.

22:04.125 --> 22:05.000
Okay, but...

22:11.416 --> 22:12.250
I'm sorry.

22:12.958 --> 22:15.125
No harm done. Okay?

22:15.208 --> 22:16.500
-Okay.
-No harm...

22:20.333 --> 22:23.916
No. We aren't doing this. Okay?

22:24.000 --> 22:25.791
-No. Okay.
-Stop that.

22:25.875 --> 22:27.416
-I beg you.
-I won't do anything.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.333
Please.

22:28.416 --> 22:30.000
-I won't do anything.
-Okay.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.125
-You stay put.
-I will.

22:32.208 --> 22:35.458
That's not what I mean!
No. We're going up.

22:35.541 --> 22:39.416
Stop. Hey, hey. Stop right now.

22:40.791 --> 22:41.875
I'm not joking.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.458
You wanted it before.

22:51.875 --> 22:52.833
Get out.

22:57.166 --> 22:58.083
Get out.

22:59.416 --> 23:00.416
Oh, my God.

23:11.250 --> 23:15.708
They will try to put at least a mic
and a GPS beacon in Rio.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.125
And we'll use it to our favor.

23:18.875 --> 23:19.958
In the Alcatraz Plan.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.666
So, they'll think we're fleeing.

23:21.750 --> 23:23.333
To make them feel that we're fleeing.

23:24.375 --> 23:25.708
<i>It's much more powerful.</i>

23:26.416 --> 23:28.291
Stop. Stop, Helsinki!

23:29.833 --> 23:31.708
The seismic sensor isn't emitting
any signal now.

23:31.791 --> 23:32.875
<i>There's the hole.</i>

23:37.416 --> 23:41.666
Adding sound effects to their fear is
the biggest generator of paranoia ever.

23:41.750 --> 23:43.208
<i>We can make them believe anything.</i>

23:44.958 --> 23:46.458
The gallery.

23:46.541 --> 23:48.875
-<i>Hurry, call Palermo.</i>
-Gallery?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.833
Is there any gallery at that depth?

23:53.166 --> 23:54.000
No.

23:54.708 --> 23:55.875
There's none.

23:55.958 --> 23:58.000
It can't be. There must be something.
Look for it!

23:58.583 --> 24:00.875
-There isn't any gallery under that point.
-Find it!

24:01.541 --> 24:02.666
<i>Listen.</i>

24:02.750 --> 24:04.916
An escape is tension.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.583
It's emotion, it's darkness.

24:08.166 --> 24:11.541
It's the cavity's echo,
the subsurface humidity.

24:11.625 --> 24:13.500
<i>They have to feel all of that.</i>

24:14.958 --> 24:15.875
And they will.

24:20.166 --> 24:21.875
They're in a flooded gallery.

24:25.458 --> 24:26.500
Turn the volume up.

24:31.125 --> 24:31.958
There's an echo.

24:35.916 --> 24:36.875
Where's Nairobi?

24:38.083 --> 24:39.666
She's not done melting.

24:40.291 --> 24:43.625
Tell her to come down. We have enough.
We're leaving now!

24:44.125 --> 24:46.083
Can they melt 90 tons of gold

24:46.166 --> 24:48.041
-in two days?
-No. That's impossible.

24:49.250 --> 24:52.750
Engineer, is it possible or not
to melt 90 tons in two days?

24:52.833 --> 24:56.916
They would need 150 or 200 ovens.
I have to do some calculations.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.500
Technically, it's possible, but...

24:59.291 --> 25:00.166
Improbable.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.166
If they did probable things,
they'd be out robbing savings banks.

25:03.541 --> 25:06.500
They'll question their ears so much

25:06.583 --> 25:09.375
that they'll need confirmation
from another sense.

25:10.666 --> 25:11.500
Sight.

25:12.083 --> 25:16.041
And that's when the gang's new member
would come into play.

25:16.125 --> 25:17.916
Be good, Sofía. It's your turn.

25:21.583 --> 25:22.416
<i>Sofía.</i>

25:25.875 --> 25:28.750
We'll put the geolocation chip in Sofía,

25:29.166 --> 25:33.541
<i>and we'll get her ready while we keep</i>
<i>bombarding them with sound.</i>

25:49.541 --> 25:50.750
What the fuck is that?

25:50.833 --> 25:52.708
It sounds like a four-stroke engine.

25:52.791 --> 25:53.750
An engine?

25:54.666 --> 25:57.791
It could be an outboard motor.

25:59.375 --> 26:00.416
With a recoil starter.

26:00.500 --> 26:03.250
Who gives a fuck about the recoil starter?
They're leaving.

26:03.333 --> 26:04.833
They're leaving!

26:04.916 --> 26:08.041
And they could only think one thing
because there's a clear precedent.

26:12.458 --> 26:13.791
And they won't like it.

26:14.208 --> 26:16.208
It's Chapo Guzmán's modus operandi.

26:16.291 --> 26:17.958
The Altiplano jail escape.

26:20.333 --> 26:21.166
I'm here.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.208
<i>We're all here now.</i>

26:28.000 --> 26:28.958
What is that?

26:32.041 --> 26:33.208
Carts.

26:34.041 --> 26:35.041
Carts!

26:35.125 --> 26:37.333
And then it will be time...

26:38.708 --> 26:40.041
to unleash the madness.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.041
<i>We will release Sofía.</i>

26:47.208 --> 26:49.333
Satellite confirmation. They're moving.

26:52.166 --> 26:53.833
At what speed are they moving?

26:53.916 --> 26:55.250
Eighteen kilometers per hour.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.875
Fuck, at that pace,
they'll be in Alcorcón in 30 minutes.

27:00.166 --> 27:01.208
What's up, Ángel?

27:01.291 --> 27:03.416
Tamayo, I need
the Emergency Military Unit.

27:03.500 --> 27:05.125
-<i>It's urgent.</i>
-Urgent? Fuck, no.

27:05.208 --> 27:06.916
They're taking the gold out
through a tunnel.

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
The national reserve,
on carts propelled by outboard motors!

27:10.541 --> 27:12.000
The Emergency Unit stays in Madrid.

27:15.458 --> 27:18.833
We'll inhibit the mic's signal
so they'll only have the satellite.

27:18.916 --> 27:19.750
<i>Then...</i>

27:20.875 --> 27:23.666
they'll have to follow us blindly
to where the GPS indicates.

27:27.208 --> 27:28.416
Wherever Sofía goes.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.958
We've lost sound.

27:30.041 --> 27:31.791
The signal is out of range.

27:31.875 --> 27:32.958
They're going very deep.

27:33.666 --> 27:35.500
Call the underground unit!

27:35.583 --> 27:38.416
And I want a detachment outside the sewer.

27:38.500 --> 27:39.875
Deploy units now!

27:47.833 --> 27:48.666
Suárez.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.666
We only have two farms left. We're close.

27:51.541 --> 27:52.375
Okay.

27:53.291 --> 27:54.333
Gentlemen!

27:54.416 --> 27:55.291
We're leaving!

28:08.833 --> 28:09.791
Forty meters.

28:09.875 --> 28:12.083
Come on, come on, come on.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.291
Come on.

28:14.750 --> 28:19.625
Yes. Yes. We have them, Bernardo,
we have them.

28:20.708 --> 28:21.541
Thirty meters.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.250
You're next to them, Bernardo.

28:25.916 --> 28:26.750
Next to them!

28:27.875 --> 28:28.791
Come on!

28:31.250 --> 28:32.541
Fifteen meters.

28:33.083 --> 28:35.291
They're at the other end of the corner.

28:38.125 --> 28:38.958
They stopped.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.083
Let's go.

28:50.125 --> 28:50.958
Seven meters.

28:51.875 --> 28:52.708
Slowly.

28:53.000 --> 28:53.958
Five meters.

28:54.958 --> 28:55.791
Bernardo!

28:56.416 --> 28:57.458
Three meters.

28:59.458 --> 29:00.416
<i>Two.</i>

29:00.875 --> 29:04.208
-They're here. They're here.
-Bernardo, what's going on? What?

29:04.291 --> 29:06.041
-Where are they?
-They're here.

29:06.416 --> 29:07.458
A meter and a half away.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.375
Fuck. What's that?

29:13.000 --> 29:13.833
<i>Colonel.</i>

29:15.125 --> 29:16.125
It's a ferret.

29:17.208 --> 29:18.375
<i>It's dressed as Dalí.</i>

29:22.041 --> 29:23.208
Those fuckers.

29:24.125 --> 29:25.208
Those fuckers.

29:25.416 --> 29:27.708
<i>Cutting off visual communication.</i>

29:30.958 --> 29:33.958
This news isn't that bad, Tamayo.
Read the situation.

29:34.041 --> 29:36.625
Really? Enlighten me.

29:38.291 --> 29:39.541
They're faking an escape.

29:40.958 --> 29:43.250
It's an extreme distraction tactic.

29:46.666 --> 29:49.125
He's fucked
and he wants us to look elsewhere.

29:49.541 --> 29:51.083
You're stressed. Aren't you?

29:51.875 --> 29:54.291
But I assure you,
he's on the verge of collapse.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.750
It's all part of his fucking plan.

30:00.833 --> 30:02.708
Yes, but he isn't the only one with plans.

30:03.666 --> 30:06.666
It's the moment to hit them
where it hurts the most.

30:09.958 --> 30:10.916
We have to attack.

30:13.000 --> 30:14.250
Go straight for the heart.

30:14.916 --> 30:16.500
Break them from the inside out.

30:21.250 --> 30:22.333
I know how to do it.

30:24.166 --> 30:25.000
How?

30:27.250 --> 30:28.416
It's already in motion.

30:29.583 --> 30:30.416
All of it.

30:35.666 --> 30:36.541
<i>I have money.</i>

30:36.625 --> 30:38.041
The police do, too.

30:38.541 --> 30:39.583
Ten million.

30:39.666 --> 30:42.166
Are you sure you've heard my name
on the news?

30:42.250 --> 30:44.083
-Of course we're sure.
-Because...

30:44.625 --> 30:47.541
they're offering ten million,
but that's for the Professor.

30:49.500 --> 30:51.166
And that's not even true.

30:51.250 --> 30:53.458
All the rewards have small print.

30:54.208 --> 30:56.625
We're farmers, but we aren't stupid.

30:57.208 --> 30:59.625
They've said it on the news, on TV.
Everywhere.

30:59.708 --> 31:02.416
I've been a police agent
and I know rewards...

31:03.041 --> 31:05.291
are never paid. Never.

31:09.333 --> 31:11.375
Tom Lee, a businessman from Michigan.

31:12.166 --> 31:15.083
He gave crucial information
about Bin Laden's whereabouts.

31:15.166 --> 31:17.250
They were offering $25 million.

31:18.458 --> 31:20.041
He's still trying to claim it.

31:24.458 --> 31:26.541
I'm not lying. You can look it up online.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.750
I can offer you money.

31:32.833 --> 31:33.666
Today.

31:34.666 --> 31:36.666
And a lot more than what
the police are offering.

31:39.250 --> 31:40.125
How much?

31:40.458 --> 31:42.083
What do you think about 15 million?

31:43.250 --> 31:44.083
Fifteen?

32:00.291 --> 32:02.458
Alert everyone of any movement.

32:04.291 --> 32:05.500
<i>Everyone, be alert.</i>

32:07.083 --> 32:08.125
<i>Perimeter covered.</i>

32:10.958 --> 32:12.750
Windows. Watch the windows.

32:12.833 --> 32:15.625
<i>Copy, sir. Watch the third floor.</i>

32:16.208 --> 32:17.041
<i>West side.</i>

32:18.125 --> 32:19.166
<i>Covered.</i>

32:28.083 --> 32:29.291
What a bitch.

32:36.625 --> 32:37.500
Come here.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.250
You're the biggest piece of shit on earth.

32:41.333 --> 32:42.875
We came here to rescue you

32:42.958 --> 32:45.416
and the first thing you do is break up
with Tokyo?

32:45.500 --> 32:47.458
Denver, that's a personal matter.

32:47.541 --> 32:51.583
It's not fucking personal.
Tokyo is a time bomb. You knew that.

32:51.666 --> 32:53.041
Ask her for forgiveness.

32:53.125 --> 32:55.750
Ask her to be your girlfriend
or to marry you.

32:55.833 --> 32:57.416
Whatever the fuck you want.

32:57.916 --> 33:00.875
And once you get out of here,
break up with her. But not here.

33:00.958 --> 33:02.916
Maybe you could grow up some.

33:04.250 --> 33:06.833
A pregnant woman
with a teddy bear is coming.

33:09.250 --> 33:12.291
Did anyone call the circus?
What the fuck is happening?

33:16.458 --> 33:18.041
<i>Watching left side.</i>

33:18.416 --> 33:20.375
<i>Entering high security perimeter.</i>

33:22.208 --> 33:23.375
<i>Everything's in order.</i>

33:23.458 --> 33:24.458
<i>Perimeter covered.</i>

33:27.083 --> 33:28.416
<i>Roof and upper floor?</i>

33:28.750 --> 33:29.750
<i>Affirmative.</i>

33:34.708 --> 33:35.541
She's crazy.

33:44.041 --> 33:45.500
We have to get that bear.

33:46.833 --> 33:48.875
We're on it right now.

33:50.208 --> 33:51.041
I'll do it.

33:52.041 --> 33:52.916
Nairobi!

33:53.833 --> 33:55.625
-Stop, Nairobi.
-What?

33:55.958 --> 33:57.333
We have a protocol.

33:59.125 --> 34:00.458
What's gotten into you?

34:01.500 --> 34:02.333
Nothing.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.250
Denver.

34:04.333 --> 34:05.416
The volunteer.

34:08.166 --> 34:09.166
I have him.

34:09.958 --> 34:11.166
What are you looking at?

34:11.250 --> 34:12.208
Come here.

34:12.833 --> 34:14.250
Come here. Look.

34:14.333 --> 34:16.916
We're going out there to get a teddy bear.

34:18.166 --> 34:20.208
But won't that be dangerous?

34:20.291 --> 34:21.541
It's not dangerous. Go.

34:22.500 --> 34:23.500
Stop!

34:24.500 --> 34:27.125
Don't do it, boy.
Don't try to be a hero. It's not worth it.

34:27.208 --> 34:29.833
You know perfectly well that it's a trap.
You can't send him out.

34:29.916 --> 34:31.625
This is practically suicide.

34:33.291 --> 34:35.666
You're condemning that boy
to certain death.

34:35.750 --> 34:38.208
Damn!
You're sending him to the slaughterhouse!

34:38.291 --> 34:39.500
It could be explosives!

34:39.583 --> 34:41.708
If it were explosives, I would send you!

34:42.166 --> 34:43.083
Shut up!

34:43.541 --> 34:46.750
Come. It's your moment.
We've talked about this. Remember?

34:47.208 --> 34:49.166
Hey, listen to me.

34:49.250 --> 34:52.291
I believe in you. I believe in you.
Be calm and composed.

34:52.666 --> 34:53.666
Amanda is watching.

34:55.958 --> 34:57.791
Come on, hurry. Come on!

35:02.833 --> 35:03.875
Masks!

35:05.333 --> 35:06.166
Rio!

35:12.583 --> 35:14.166
They're opening the doors, sir.

35:23.500 --> 35:25.750
Hostages with fake weapons, sir.

35:26.458 --> 35:28.416
I can see them, Antoñanzas!
I can see them!

35:30.208 --> 35:31.833
I'm a hostage, don't shoot!

35:31.916 --> 35:33.916
I'm Miguel Fernández Talanilla
from Totana, Murcia.

35:34.208 --> 35:35.708
Intern at the Systems Department.

35:35.791 --> 35:38.458
Be careful with the masked ones.
There could be thieves among them.

35:39.875 --> 35:41.500
<i>Understood, sir. We're alert.</i>

35:43.875 --> 35:45.000
<i>Waiting for orders.</i>

35:49.708 --> 35:51.041
<i>He's grabbing the teddy bear.</i>

36:07.500 --> 36:08.541
The bomb is inside.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.750
Mission accomplished, Mr. Denver.

36:12.333 --> 36:13.333
Very well, Miguel.

36:13.666 --> 36:14.625
Now, give it to me.

36:14.708 --> 36:17.125
Be careful with any sudden movements.

36:17.208 --> 36:18.500
Take it to the X-ray.

36:21.041 --> 36:23.291
I can go out for any exchange,
Mr. Palermo.

36:48.500 --> 36:49.791
There's a phone here,

36:49.958 --> 36:51.208
but there's no bomb.

36:51.916 --> 36:54.333
-There's another thing.
-Open it, Helsinki.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.041
The phone.

37:22.458 --> 37:24.333
You bitch!

37:25.125 --> 37:26.125
The fuck do you want?

37:26.958 --> 37:28.041
To make you an offer.

37:28.625 --> 37:29.833
Go to hell.

37:31.166 --> 37:32.208
Okay.

37:33.333 --> 37:36.250
Where do you think you're going?
Did it strike a chord...

37:36.333 --> 37:37.166
Let me go.

37:42.166 --> 37:44.375
What the fuck is happening here?

37:44.458 --> 37:47.083
I don't know what the fuck is wrong
with her, but I want her here.

37:47.166 --> 37:48.666
Now! Go!

37:49.750 --> 37:52.083
-No. No.
-What?

37:52.750 --> 37:54.166
-I'll go.
-No, you won't.

37:55.333 --> 37:56.333
I said, I'll go.

38:04.666 --> 38:08.250
Between the police and the thieves,
I trust the police.

38:08.333 --> 38:12.000
These thieves have dumped
140 million euros on the center of Madrid.

38:12.958 --> 38:16.708
Do you really think we don't have 15 or 20
to give you in exchange for your help?

38:16.791 --> 38:19.000
Yes, but that's dirty money.

38:19.458 --> 38:21.666
-The police's money is legal.
-It's legal.

38:24.583 --> 38:26.833
If you hand me over,
you'll be outcasts.

38:27.583 --> 38:29.833
As soon as they have me,
they'll disappear,

38:29.916 --> 38:30.750
but you won't.

38:30.833 --> 38:32.583
You'll be on every TV.

38:33.625 --> 38:36.250
The couple that handed Lisbon over.
They'll hate you.

38:37.125 --> 38:39.208
Everyone here loves us. Do you know why?

38:40.708 --> 38:44.083
Because we came back to rescue a friend
who was being tortured.

38:44.166 --> 38:48.000
And those torturers are the same
who are offering you the ten million.

38:49.750 --> 38:50.708
So, think it over.

38:51.875 --> 38:53.000
And take the money.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.208
You'll have it in two hours.

38:56.416 --> 38:58.458
And nobody will ever know about this.

38:59.666 --> 39:00.708
I give you my word.

39:10.291 --> 39:11.125
Okay.

39:15.166 --> 39:16.000
Fuck.

39:32.208 --> 39:34.791
It's the police.
The police are here, Justino.

39:44.458 --> 39:46.333
That's your son's bear, isn't it?

39:52.500 --> 39:53.958
It doesn't smell like him anymore.

39:58.833 --> 39:59.666
Nairobi.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.708
They did it to hurt you.

40:03.791 --> 40:05.291
Yeah. I know.

40:06.375 --> 40:08.458
And now I'm really fucked because...

40:09.125 --> 40:10.625
the only thing I want now...

40:11.666 --> 40:13.125
is to smell my son.

40:18.208 --> 40:19.375
I'm a bad mother.

40:20.500 --> 40:21.333
No.

40:23.125 --> 40:24.000
No, Nairobi.

40:25.333 --> 40:27.000
You were the mother you could be.

40:28.291 --> 40:29.500
And you paid for it.

40:30.250 --> 40:33.375
You paid a lot. And you're still paying.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.791
You don't know shit.

40:36.875 --> 40:38.625
Do you know what I did with this bear?

40:41.291 --> 40:43.708
I'm so ashamed
that not even Helsinki knows about it.

40:46.750 --> 40:48.416
When they called me to buy drugs,

40:49.791 --> 40:51.583
I took my son to the park.

40:53.666 --> 40:54.708
I dressed him up.

40:56.291 --> 40:57.750
He sat in his chair.

40:59.416 --> 41:00.708
And I gave him his bear.

41:02.083 --> 41:04.125
And inside the bear, his mom...

41:05.666 --> 41:06.875
hid pills...

41:07.833 --> 41:08.875
cocaine...

41:10.000 --> 41:10.875
heroine...

41:12.500 --> 41:13.875
and whatever else I needed.

41:16.083 --> 41:18.208
That's how I took my kid to the park.

41:21.958 --> 41:22.875
I used him...

41:24.666 --> 41:25.500
as a mule.

41:29.583 --> 41:30.916
So, they took him away from me.

41:37.291 --> 41:38.750
And they were right to do it.

42:06.208 --> 42:07.666
<i>I've brought your son here.</i>

42:08.583 --> 42:10.416
-What?
-<i>Axel.</i>

42:11.208 --> 42:12.333
<i>He's here with me.</i>

42:16.208 --> 42:17.041
That's not true.

42:17.125 --> 42:17.958
It is.

42:21.416 --> 42:25.333
He's in front of me, one meter away.
He's as funny as ever.

42:26.625 --> 42:28.833
<i>But he's nine. Axel.</i>

42:28.916 --> 42:31.416
-What do you want to be when you grow up?
-A cook.

42:31.958 --> 42:33.416
-<i>What?</i>
-<i>A cook.</i>

42:33.500 --> 42:34.375
What?

42:34.458 --> 42:35.625
A cook!

42:35.708 --> 42:38.541
-<i>He wants to be a cook.</i>
-You're lying. I'm gonna hang up.

42:38.958 --> 42:39.916
Don't hang up.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.666
I have something to offer you.

42:43.291 --> 42:45.041
<i>But first of all,</i>

42:46.208 --> 42:47.625
I'll show you I don't lie.

42:48.708 --> 42:50.125
I don't trust bitches like you.

42:50.208 --> 42:52.375
Yes. I don't either.

42:53.875 --> 42:54.708
Come, Axel.

42:55.625 --> 42:56.875
Let's do something.

42:57.541 --> 42:59.041
I'm going out there...

43:00.166 --> 43:01.000
with him.

43:01.416 --> 43:03.708
And you will see
that what I'm saying is true.

43:04.833 --> 43:06.041
Then we'll talk.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.333
I have something important to tell you.

43:33.250 --> 43:35.166
-Permission to shoot?
-My son.

43:35.250 --> 43:37.208
-Shoot.
-Nairobi, get out of there!

43:54.291 --> 43:57.083
Nairobi. Nairobi. Don't touch it. Don't.

43:58.333 --> 43:59.208
No!

44:01.291 --> 44:02.333
Help!

44:03.083 --> 44:04.291
Help! Come here!

44:04.375 --> 44:05.916
Please, hide me somewhere.

44:06.500 --> 44:07.958
Please. You have to hide me.

44:08.583 --> 44:10.333
Hide me somewhere, please!

44:10.416 --> 44:11.416
Twenty million.

44:12.208 --> 44:13.333
Yes. Fine.

44:13.416 --> 44:14.791
I have two million in my bag.

44:15.458 --> 44:17.416
Once I'm out of here,
I'll give you the rest.

44:17.500 --> 44:18.958
-I swear.
-Don't listen to her.

44:19.041 --> 44:20.416
There's no time, Justino!

44:20.500 --> 44:21.875
Stop! Stop that!

44:21.958 --> 44:24.833
Calm down. It's a radio.
I want you to hear this.

44:26.166 --> 44:28.375
<i>Professor. It's Lisbon. I'm surrounded.</i>

44:29.000 --> 44:32.083
I need to give 18 million to some people
so they'll help me. Is it possible?

44:32.750 --> 44:34.916
Of course. We'll give it to them
as soon as possible.

44:35.416 --> 44:37.583
He never betrays his word. Neither do I.

44:37.666 --> 44:38.833
Twenty million.

44:39.333 --> 44:40.375
Do you accept?

44:43.541 --> 44:44.541
They have dogs.

44:45.000 --> 44:47.458
They will find her.
We will go to jail, Justino.

44:48.291 --> 44:49.958
We have the trapdoor.

44:50.041 --> 44:51.958
I can cover it with manure.

44:52.041 --> 44:53.750
<i>-The dogs won't smell her.</i>
<i>-There's no time!</i>

44:54.291 --> 44:56.041
-Please, Reni.
-Please!

44:57.791 --> 44:58.666
No.

45:09.458 --> 45:10.458
Help, please.

45:11.041 --> 45:13.291
Nairobi! Nairobi, please. Hold on!

45:13.375 --> 45:15.791
Nairobi. Let me do it. Nairobi.

45:15.875 --> 45:17.458
You have to hold on, Nairobi!

45:17.541 --> 45:19.500
I'm really fucked, Helsi.

45:19.583 --> 45:20.791
The bullet's inside.

45:20.875 --> 45:22.625
It's inside. That's good, that's good.

45:22.708 --> 45:23.833
We'll get it out.

45:23.916 --> 45:25.375
Gauze! Gauze!

45:26.166 --> 45:28.041
Give me the gauze.

45:34.291 --> 45:36.208
They must be busy playing doctor now.

45:37.250 --> 45:39.916
-We'll go all in. Won't we?
-It's time.

45:40.833 --> 45:42.833
Gentlemen, launch the attack!

45:44.583 --> 45:45.833
Armored units, go.

46:04.083 --> 46:06.125
We're going to knock down that damn gate.

46:07.625 --> 46:08.458
Raquel.

46:09.750 --> 46:10.583
Let's go.

46:12.958 --> 46:14.916
They're going to hide me in a basement.

46:21.166 --> 46:22.000
Stop there!

46:22.791 --> 46:24.333
Raquel Murillo is inside here!

46:24.416 --> 46:26.000
She's talking to the Professor.

46:26.083 --> 46:26.958
-Delta.
-Drop the gun!

46:31.916 --> 46:33.833
Easy, easy.

46:34.541 --> 46:36.041
-Is it inside?
-Yes. It's inside.

46:36.125 --> 46:38.041
-Morphine!
-They got me good.

46:38.833 --> 46:40.375
It ripped me apart.

46:40.458 --> 46:41.416
No.

46:42.125 --> 46:44.750
Drop the weapon! Drop the weapon!

46:45.125 --> 46:46.708
Against the tree!

46:46.791 --> 46:48.750
-Against the tree!
-I didn't do anything.

46:48.833 --> 46:50.583
-Please.
-Sierra, do you hear me?

46:50.666 --> 46:52.666
-Yeah, talk to me.
<i>-We have Murillo.</i>

46:52.750 --> 46:54.166
<i>She's talking to the Professor.</i>

46:54.250 --> 46:55.541
What do you want me to do?

46:57.375 --> 46:59.750
-Don't move!
-No, Justino, no.

47:00.083 --> 47:02.416
-<i>Don't move!</i>
-<i>Hide me.</i>

47:02.500 --> 47:03.500
Don't move!

47:04.916 --> 47:05.750
On your knees!

47:08.750 --> 47:10.916
I'm going to give you morphine
to get the bullet out.

47:11.000 --> 47:12.125
Hold on.

47:12.875 --> 47:13.750
Hold on.

47:14.083 --> 47:15.541
-Morphine!
-Morphine, here.

47:19.083 --> 47:20.041
Justino, help me.

47:20.416 --> 47:21.541
I can't.

47:21.625 --> 47:25.041
Velasco, Solana, come with me.
The rest, surround the house.

47:27.958 --> 47:29.000
Police!

47:29.583 --> 47:31.166
There's nothing to do now.

47:31.833 --> 47:32.833
Guys!

47:33.791 --> 47:35.625
Guys, guys, guys!

47:35.958 --> 47:37.958
They're coming with fucking tanks!

47:38.041 --> 47:38.875
Fuck!

47:42.791 --> 47:44.708
Police! Police!

47:46.250 --> 47:48.416
-Put down your weapon!
-Hands where I can see them!

47:48.500 --> 47:49.583
Hands on your head!

47:50.958 --> 47:52.041
Sir, get out of here.

47:52.708 --> 47:53.541
Raquel.

47:55.541 --> 47:57.375
Why are you sending him outside, Suárez?

47:59.500 --> 48:03.333
-Don't go, Justino, don't go!
-She's dangerous. I order you to leave.

48:03.416 --> 48:05.208
-What are you going to do?
-Suárez.

48:05.291 --> 48:08.333
I'm handing myself over. I'm unarmed.
What are you doing?

48:08.791 --> 48:10.666
Velasco, take this citizen outside!

48:10.750 --> 48:14.750
-What are you going to do?
-Justino, don't leave. Don't leave!

48:15.291 --> 48:18.250
What are you going to do?

48:18.333 --> 48:19.958
-Justino!
-Against the tree.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.333
Against the tree! Don't move!

48:23.416 --> 48:26.291
Suárez, I'm not a threat.

48:26.375 --> 48:28.291
You're the biggest threat, bitch.

48:29.500 --> 48:31.583
You sold us all out, traitor!

48:33.166 --> 48:34.875
Suárez, put down the gun.

48:35.250 --> 48:36.333
Where is the Professor?

48:37.708 --> 48:40.583
Raquel, tell them you'll give me up.
Buy time until I can get there.

48:41.041 --> 48:42.041
<i>Raquel, tell him.</i>

48:42.708 --> 48:43.750
Where is the Professor?

48:43.833 --> 48:45.250
I don't know where he is.

48:45.583 --> 48:47.916
Raquel, I'm on my way. Raquel.

48:48.000 --> 48:49.791
Where is the Professor?

48:49.875 --> 48:50.875
I don't know!

48:52.000 --> 48:52.833
Are you sure?

48:54.291 --> 48:56.166
Because I'm only going to ask you
once more.

48:57.708 --> 48:59.083
Get out of there!

48:59.333 --> 49:00.208
<i>Get out of there!</i>

49:03.333 --> 49:05.208
I don't know where the Professor is.

49:05.750 --> 49:06.583
I don't.

49:07.458 --> 49:08.750
Wrong answer.

49:15.958 --> 49:18.958
I'm on my way.
Get out of there. Get out of there!

49:42.208 --> 49:43.458
It was self-defense.

49:44.208 --> 49:45.541
Do you understand, Solana?

49:45.625 --> 49:46.666
<i>She shot first.</i>

49:46.750 --> 49:49.708
<i>Take the weapon. Clean the fingerprints.</i>
<i>Put it in her hand.</i>

49:54.000 --> 49:55.416
Professor, it's Palermo.

49:58.416 --> 50:00.333
Get ready for immediate intervention.

50:00.416 --> 50:04.708
As soon as we knock down that gate,
we're going in with all the troops.

50:06.000 --> 50:07.708
<i>Professor, it's Palermo. Do you copy?</i>

50:10.708 --> 50:12.583
Professor, it's Palermo. Do you copy?

50:14.833 --> 50:16.291
<i>Sergio! Are you there?</i>

50:18.500 --> 50:19.333
Sergio!

50:27.041 --> 50:28.375
They've executed Lisbon.

50:34.666 --> 50:36.083
They've taken down Nairobi here.

50:37.375 --> 50:39.000
A sniper. It's really serious.

50:39.625 --> 50:41.250
-Hold on.
-Yes.

50:41.791 --> 50:42.625
Almost.

50:43.666 --> 50:46.125
I saw my son.

50:48.000 --> 50:49.458
Just now.

50:51.375 --> 50:52.250
He's fine.

50:52.333 --> 50:53.833
He's fine.

50:53.916 --> 50:55.125
He's fine.

50:56.416 --> 51:00.250
Palermo! Palermo!
They're coming with a tank.

51:00.333 --> 51:01.875
They're going to knock down the door.

51:03.000 --> 51:04.166
We're being attacked.

51:04.625 --> 51:05.541
Palermo...

51:09.000 --> 51:10.291
this isn't a robbery...

51:12.125 --> 51:13.625
or a challenge to the system.

51:16.041 --> 51:17.208
This is war.

51:20.666 --> 51:22.083
Act accordingly.

51:23.416 --> 51:24.291
Sir...

51:26.333 --> 51:28.208
it was an honor to be under your command.

51:29.250 --> 51:30.500
DEFCON 2!

51:31.041 --> 51:33.541
Denver! Come!

51:34.791 --> 51:35.958
Ready.

51:37.750 --> 51:39.791
When he turns 18,

51:40.291 --> 51:43.291
give him the money and tell him
who his mother was.

51:43.833 --> 51:44.666
No.

51:45.208 --> 51:46.583
-Swear it to me.
-Yes.

51:46.666 --> 51:48.166
Look at me.

51:48.708 --> 51:49.916
You will do it yourself.

51:51.000 --> 51:52.000
Okay?

51:53.625 --> 51:56.875
You are going to get out of here
and you'll do whatever you want.

51:58.041 --> 52:00.375
-Helsinki! DEFCON 2 now!
-Palermo!

52:00.750 --> 52:03.708
Not now! I'm with Nairobi now, Palermo.

52:05.000 --> 52:05.875
I'll go!

52:14.791 --> 52:16.291
Sir, we're ready for the assault.

52:22.416 --> 52:23.250
Now!

52:34.458 --> 52:38.375
Attention! Clear this area.
Two groups, two corners. Now!

52:42.333 --> 52:44.291
On your knees with your hands
on your head!

52:48.541 --> 52:49.458
Come on!

52:58.583 --> 52:59.916
Come on, Rio. Come on.

53:00.000 --> 53:01.166
In position.

53:05.541 --> 53:06.791
Wait for it.

53:12.208 --> 53:13.208
Wait for it.

53:19.291 --> 53:20.375
Gates!

53:25.916 --> 53:27.208
Fire!

54:50.541 --> 54:53.250
<i>The Professor had fallen for his own trap.</i>

54:54.833 --> 54:57.125
<i>The ear's ability to elicit paranoia.</i>

55:07.791 --> 55:09.416
<i>That's the card Sierra had played...</i>

55:09.958 --> 55:11.583
Pretend to execute her.

55:12.416 --> 55:13.541
<i>He'll be listening.</i>

55:15.333 --> 55:16.583
<i>...to destroy us.</i>

55:36.750 --> 55:39.000
<i>Then, it was war.</i>
