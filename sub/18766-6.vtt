00:00.176 --> 00:02.240
Previously on Sleepy Hollow...

00:02.241 --> 00:03.434
Malcolm Dreyfuss.

00:03.435 --> 00:05.270
Every supernatural encounter we've had

00:05.271 --> 00:06.312
leads back to Dreyfuss.

00:06.313 --> 00:08.697
You'd sold your soul to the
devil. And now you're collecting

00:08.698 --> 00:10.864
powerful artifacts to
perpetrate more evil.

00:10.865 --> 00:12.866
Innocent lives be damned.

00:12.867 --> 00:14.368
You say you saw his man

00:14.369 --> 00:15.535
procuring an item.

00:15.536 --> 00:17.070
I'll see you in the morning.

00:22.677 --> 00:24.378
The Philosopher's Stone.

00:24.379 --> 00:26.106
You were going to cheat out of your deal

00:26.107 --> 00:27.514
by cheating death itself.

00:27.515 --> 00:30.851
If I never die, I never
have to lose my soul.

00:30.852 --> 00:33.220
George Washington hid the
Philosopher's Stone pieces

00:33.221 --> 00:35.122
on the strongest ley line intersection.

00:35.123 --> 00:37.085
That's where we'll find the last piece.

00:37.086 --> 00:38.225
Where is it?

00:38.226 --> 00:40.026
Sleepy Hollow.

00:42.130 --> 00:45.098
Hardtack, peppered jerky,

00:45.099 --> 00:49.403
a myriad nuts, seeds,
dried fruit and beverages.

00:49.404 --> 00:51.438
Provisions amassed here

00:51.439 --> 00:54.775
would sustain a year-long
expedition into the wild.

00:54.776 --> 00:57.577
We're only 45 from
the Sleepy Hollow exit.

00:57.578 --> 00:59.613
Chips will do the trick.

01:01.282 --> 01:02.749
Chips.

01:04.584 --> 01:07.421
In my day, a road trip required
more than simply a credit card.

01:07.422 --> 01:09.489
You needed the skill to hunt game,

01:09.490 --> 01:12.959
set a snare, skin, gut
and prepare a carcass,

01:12.960 --> 01:16.163
build a smokehouse, procure
salt, vinegar, chicory.

01:16.164 --> 01:18.865
That is how you make a Slim Jim.

01:18.866 --> 01:21.635
Check your raccoon tail
at the door, Daniel Boone.

01:21.636 --> 01:25.005
There is no amount of colonial
know-how that could have created

01:25.006 --> 01:27.441
the wonder that is...

01:27.442 --> 01:30.911
the Blue Frost Razzle
dazzleberry bucket o' slush.

01:32.000 --> 01:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:46.327 --> 01:49.629
I believe this is what is
known as a "brain freeze."

01:49.630 --> 01:51.031
Please, would you...

01:55.803 --> 01:57.838
Molly would kill me
if she saw me drinking

01:57.839 --> 02:00.207
that high fructose corn
syrup delivery device.

02:00.208 --> 02:01.862
But with Dreyfuss about to assemble

02:01.863 --> 02:03.009
the Philosopher's Stone,

02:03.010 --> 02:05.245
there's a case to be made
for the simple pleasures.

02:05.246 --> 02:09.983
Dreyfuss may be a step away,
but we are a step ahead.

02:09.984 --> 02:13.553
If we can procure the final
piece of the Talisman first,

02:13.554 --> 02:15.222
we'll thwart his plan.

02:15.223 --> 02:17.858
Can this thing really make him immortal?

02:19.594 --> 02:22.362
Its transmutative power is unmatched.

02:22.363 --> 02:24.931
It has but one limitation:

02:24.932 --> 02:27.968
It cannot create something from nothing.

02:27.969 --> 02:29.352
So if Dreyfuss seeks eternal life,

02:29.353 --> 02:30.971
the Stone must draw power

02:30.972 --> 02:32.839
from the life force
of other human beings.

02:32.840 --> 02:36.209
And the price of immortality

02:36.210 --> 02:39.346
would be thousands of innocent lives.

02:44.018 --> 02:46.119
Jobe!

02:48.022 --> 02:50.690
Jobe!

02:53.594 --> 02:56.663
Where the hell are you?

03:03.971 --> 03:07.441
I call upon thee, Prince of Darkness.

03:07.442 --> 03:09.142
By the terms of our blood contract,

03:09.143 --> 03:12.245
I demand that you guide me
to the vassal you bestowed.

03:30.531 --> 03:31.498
Jobe!

03:31.499 --> 03:33.099
Jobe!

03:33.100 --> 03:34.200
Jobe!

03:52.787 --> 03:54.588
Thank you, Malcolm.

03:54.589 --> 03:56.556
That was...

03:56.557 --> 03:57.724
unpleasant.

03:57.725 --> 03:59.226
Damn it, Jobe.

03:59.227 --> 04:01.661
The terms of my
contract were very clear.

04:01.662 --> 04:05.265
You were to remain at
my side for the duration.

04:05.266 --> 04:08.735
I apologize for the dereliction of duty.

04:08.736 --> 04:10.203
I was caught off guard.

04:10.204 --> 04:12.305
That will not happen again.

04:12.306 --> 04:14.174
And the Everliving Rock?

04:14.175 --> 04:15.942
It's in my possession.

04:15.943 --> 04:18.879
All that remains is the
final Talisman piece,

04:18.880 --> 04:21.781
one that I... I cannot
find without your help.

04:21.781 --> 04:23.717
I'm on the case, Malcolm.

04:23.718 --> 04:25.418
Good.

04:25.419 --> 04:28.255
Then let's get out of
here. It's hotter than hell.

04:28.256 --> 04:30.457
An assumption that I plan
on never getting the chance

04:30.458 --> 04:32.392
to confirm after today.

04:51.145 --> 04:54.214
Coming back here must
be complicated for you.

04:55.616 --> 04:57.317
To say the least.

04:57.318 --> 05:00.320
I lost much in Sleepy Hollow.

05:00.321 --> 05:02.856
The Lieutenant...

05:02.857 --> 05:05.892
my wife...

05:05.893 --> 05:08.628
my son.

05:08.629 --> 05:10.964
But for all the sorrow I experienced,

05:10.965 --> 05:14.701
there was also unrivalled
friendship, camaraderie

05:14.702 --> 05:17.370
and, of course, my introduction

05:17.371 --> 05:20.707
to this infinitely curious modern world.

05:20.708 --> 05:23.209
This is where you first learned
you were a Witness, right?

05:23.210 --> 05:24.878
Correct.

05:24.879 --> 05:28.381
General Washington left
a Bible that described

05:28.382 --> 05:31.484
the responsibility Abbie Mills
and I were to bear together.

05:31.485 --> 05:34.988
Wait, Washington knew you were
a Witness and didn't tell you?

05:34.989 --> 05:36.623
It was a time of war.

05:38.125 --> 05:40.293
I have no doubt my commanding officer

05:40.294 --> 05:42.128
had very good reason
to keep me in the dark.

05:44.198 --> 05:45.398
You're a good soldier.

05:56.210 --> 05:58.612
It's kind of...

05:58.613 --> 06:01.281
It's nice here.

06:01.282 --> 06:04.284
You sound disappointed.

06:04.285 --> 06:06.052
All the supernatural action

06:06.053 --> 06:08.188
that took place over the
years in this zip code,

06:08.189 --> 06:11.891
I was kind of expecting
more of a Stephen King vibe.

06:17.259 --> 06:19.219
Kind of looks like the
town where I grew up.

06:19.220 --> 06:22.302
And that place never looked
better than in the tail lights.

06:22.303 --> 06:24.104
Crane and Diana will be here any minute.

06:24.105 --> 06:25.672
We should get a move on.

06:25.673 --> 06:27.073
All appearances aside,

06:27.074 --> 06:29.275
this place is a minefield
of supernatural horror

06:29.276 --> 06:32.779
waiting to rear its head when
you least expect it, so...

06:32.780 --> 06:34.414
keep your guard up.

06:35.516 --> 06:37.517
Welcome to Sleepy Hollow.

06:37.518 --> 06:39.052
Where the magic happens.

06:39.053 --> 06:40.453
Literally.

06:40.454 --> 06:42.389
And if all goes to plan,

06:42.390 --> 06:44.224
this should help us locate

06:44.225 --> 06:46.726
where the last Talisman
piece was hidden.

06:46.727 --> 06:48.561
We are thankful you were able to procure

06:48.562 --> 06:51.698
this Judas Scepter at such
short notice, Miss Jenny.

06:51.699 --> 06:53.967
It looks like a tuning fork gone wrong.

06:53.968 --> 06:55.431
It's basically a dowsing rod,

06:55.432 --> 06:57.671
but drawn to magic instead of water.

06:57.672 --> 07:01.241
The more powerful the magic,
the stronger you feel the pull.

07:01.242 --> 07:02.442
Tap,

07:02.443 --> 07:03.643
close your eyes.

07:04.779 --> 07:06.846
Got something.

07:45.319 --> 07:49.089
The signal's... strong,
but it's erratic.

07:49.090 --> 07:50.256
- Okay.
- Whoa.

07:51.292 --> 07:53.593
Feels like it's... close,

07:53.594 --> 07:55.929
but it's...

07:55.930 --> 07:58.431
It's yanking me all over the place.

07:58.432 --> 07:59.999
Are you sure you're using it right?

08:00.000 --> 08:02.335
It didn't come with instructions.

08:04.872 --> 08:07.073
I think I just lost the signal.

08:07.074 --> 08:09.409
Is it possible there's
some sort of interference?

08:09.410 --> 08:10.910
I mean, curio shops aside,

08:10.911 --> 08:14.247
isn't this town sort of a
hotbed for supernatural activity?

08:14.248 --> 08:17.050
It was a map of the
powerful ley lines converging

08:17.051 --> 08:18.885
on Sleepy Hollow that
revealed the whereabouts

08:18.886 --> 08:20.687
of the Talisman to us.

08:20.688 --> 08:22.856
Perhaps their considerable energy

08:22.857 --> 08:24.691
is interfering with
the Scepter's reception.

08:24.692 --> 08:26.893
If we cross-reference
our ley line chart

08:26.894 --> 08:29.529
with a topographical map,
I might be able to isolate

08:29.530 --> 08:31.473
the area of interference
and then correct for it.

08:31.474 --> 08:35.034
Good. I have many, many
detailed maps in my Archives.

08:35.034 --> 08:36.469
Follow me.

09:23.361 --> 09:27.298
As Dorothy Gale said with such alacrity,

09:27.299 --> 09:31.535
"There is no place like home."

09:31.536 --> 09:33.537
You said you have some maps for me?

09:33.538 --> 09:36.140
Yes, indeed. This way, Miss Alex.

09:36.141 --> 09:37.942
While you two get busy
with the topography,

09:37.943 --> 09:41.145
I'll, take a look around for
info on ley line interference.

09:41.146 --> 09:42.513
Very good.

09:45.684 --> 09:49.253
So this is Crane's man cave.

09:49.254 --> 09:51.055
Yeah. What can I say?

09:51.056 --> 09:52.289
Dude loves his books.

09:54.993 --> 09:56.527
The library.

09:57.829 --> 09:59.363
Lab.

09:59.364 --> 10:01.699
There's a secret entrance
behind that grating

10:01.700 --> 10:04.168
that leads down to the tunnel system.

10:04.169 --> 10:07.538
What secret base is
complete without one?

10:16.948 --> 10:18.349
Your desk?

10:20.252 --> 10:25.222
My sister used to post up here.

10:25.223 --> 10:26.991
Loved her coffee.

10:26.992 --> 10:29.193
From the way Crane
talks about her, she...

10:29.194 --> 10:32.263
She was something special.

10:32.264 --> 10:35.900
They had something special.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.768
We all did.

10:37.769 --> 10:39.803
I'm sorry, do you...
do you need a minute?

10:41.540 --> 10:43.674
No, I'm fine.

10:47.946 --> 10:51.148
There's lots of ghosts in this
place, but all ones I adore.

10:53.652 --> 10:55.486
Capital work!

10:55.487 --> 10:57.254
Here we are.

10:58.757 --> 11:00.958
- There.
- I think I can whip up a Faraday cage

11:00.959 --> 11:02.459
that'll filter out ley line energy

11:02.460 --> 11:03.963
and allow the Scepter a clear signal.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.296
I just need a few things:

11:05.297 --> 11:07.831
Copper wire, a 4.5 volt battery,

11:07.832 --> 11:10.234
and then the motherboard from a TRS-80.

11:10.235 --> 11:11.669
I've got a storage space near here

11:11.670 --> 11:13.614
that has all that gack
and more... I'll take you.

11:13.615 --> 11:16.740
Very good. If you
modify the Judas Scepter,

11:16.741 --> 11:18.509
Agent Thomas and I
shall continue to search

11:18.510 --> 11:21.478
for information on the
Philosopher's Stone.

11:21.479 --> 11:23.302
This is the part of the
job I've been missing.

11:23.303 --> 11:25.583
Yeah, poison ivy,
mosquitoes... got to love it.

11:25.584 --> 11:28.085
Come on, you live
for this as much as I do.

11:28.086 --> 11:30.821
The past month is the first
time I've felt that what we do

11:30.822 --> 11:32.923
makes a real difference.

11:32.924 --> 11:35.492
So insert snide comment here.

11:35.493 --> 11:37.828
No, dude. I second
the emotion, actually.

11:37.829 --> 11:39.597
It's one thing to want to help.

11:39.598 --> 11:41.332
It's another to be equipped for it.

11:41.333 --> 11:43.969
Being naive will get you
hurt or killed or worse.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.593
And in this line of
work, there are fates

11:45.594 --> 11:47.304
that make death pale in comparison.

11:47.305 --> 11:49.640
Okay, so there's a learning curve.

11:49.641 --> 11:50.908
I mean, come on.

11:50.909 --> 11:54.378
You weren't born a Furiosa-style,

11:54.379 --> 11:55.446
combat-boot-wearing,

11:55.447 --> 11:57.047
chip-shouldering badass, were you?

11:58.216 --> 12:00.384
Okay, maybe you were.

12:02.654 --> 12:04.355
I'm just saying you need to be realistic

12:04.356 --> 12:05.556
about the dangers we face.

12:17.302 --> 12:18.769
Agent Thomas,

12:18.770 --> 12:21.639
I have something you might like to see.

12:21.640 --> 12:25.643
These letters were penned
by General Washington.

12:25.644 --> 12:29.613
I've read them all before, of course...

12:29.614 --> 12:31.048
but I missed something...

12:31.049 --> 12:35.052
a cipher that has
revealed new information.

12:35.053 --> 12:37.721
These were written in 1781,

12:37.722 --> 12:41.325
mere days before I first
met the Horseman of Death.

12:41.326 --> 12:43.627
That's when...

12:43.628 --> 12:46.063
When I... died.

12:47.832 --> 12:52.136
These could shed new
light on those events.

12:52.137 --> 12:54.805
And crucial information
about the Philosopher's Stone.

12:54.806 --> 12:57.875
Indeed. This particular missive

12:57.876 --> 12:59.677
contains hidden information

12:59.678 --> 13:02.246
on a clandestine meeting
between Washington

13:02.247 --> 13:03.881
and Benjamin Banneker.

13:08.053 --> 13:09.386
Mr. Banneker,

13:09.387 --> 13:10.954
you've found it, haven't you?

13:10.955 --> 13:13.524
Yes. After years of searching,

13:13.525 --> 13:16.360
my survey team has located
the Philosopher's Stone.

13:16.361 --> 13:20.197
You see the problem at hand, General...

13:20.198 --> 13:22.192
the Stone lies on land
that will soon be contested

13:22.193 --> 13:23.296
in a battle with the Crown.

13:23.297 --> 13:24.668
I've come for permission

13:24.669 --> 13:27.871
to enact the Division
while we still have time.

13:27.872 --> 13:30.702
Of course. We cannot let the
Stone fall into enemy hands.

13:30.703 --> 13:32.064
And the Division will ensure this.

13:32.065 --> 13:34.211
I understand how it is
meant to work, Mr. Banneker.

13:34.212 --> 13:36.013
Your team of engineers
will divide the Stone

13:36.014 --> 13:39.383
into four pieces, three
to be entrusted in secret

13:39.384 --> 13:40.584
to a brave compatriot.

13:40.585 --> 13:44.621
Yes. And the last and final to myself.

13:44.622 --> 13:46.924
Each will be hidden,
safeguarded through the ages.

13:46.925 --> 13:48.459
Whatever the outcome of this war,

13:48.460 --> 13:50.928
or the future path of this nation,

13:50.929 --> 13:53.263
the Division will endure.

13:53.264 --> 13:56.800
I have no doubt, and
this plan will be enacted.

13:56.801 --> 13:59.236
But not today.

13:59.237 --> 14:01.905
Before we divide the Stone,
we must first make use of it.

14:04.542 --> 14:09.113
General, we both know the
cost of using the Stone

14:09.114 --> 14:10.981
is measured in human lives.

14:10.982 --> 14:14.022
This is a decision I
make with a heavy heart.

14:14.423 --> 14:16.987
But using the Stone may be
the only thing that allows

14:16.988 --> 14:19.289
our nation to survive its infancy.

14:21.459 --> 14:23.627
And there the missive ends.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.531
Now, we know Washington
eventually followed.

14:27.532 --> 14:29.032
Banneker's plan for the Division...

14:29.033 --> 14:30.736
And that Dreyfuss has
the same information.

14:30.737 --> 14:33.103
Indeed, but with this new thread,

14:33.104 --> 14:35.038
that Washington
intended to use the Stone

14:35.039 --> 14:36.707
before it was divided...

14:36.708 --> 14:39.109
if we can find the rest
of the correspondence,

14:39.110 --> 14:40.778
we may learn to what end.

14:40.779 --> 14:43.180
Okay, we'll find it after
we find the last piece.

14:43.181 --> 14:45.682
Right now, we have to
hope that Alex can block

14:45.683 --> 14:48.152
the ley line interference
so we can find the Talisman

14:48.153 --> 14:50.354
and nip Dreyfuss' plan in the bud.

14:52.123 --> 14:53.690
Very well.

14:55.860 --> 15:00.364
Banneker's legacy, that
the Division endure,

15:00.365 --> 15:02.599
now rests on our shoulders.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.502
This is where I lost the signal.

15:05.503 --> 15:08.138
Okay. So, do like you did before,

15:08.139 --> 15:09.606
just a little bit gentler.

15:13.378 --> 15:15.979
There we go.

15:15.980 --> 15:18.816
Nice work, Alex.

15:18.817 --> 15:20.851
It's taking us towards the graveyard.

15:33.031 --> 15:34.932
Take cover!

15:34.933 --> 15:37.367
Go! Go! Go!

15:43.208 --> 15:45.342
Who is shooting those at us?

15:45.343 --> 15:47.311
I don't know. Whoa.

15:47.312 --> 15:50.914
We must be right on top
of the Talisman piece.

15:50.915 --> 15:52.858
I'm guessing something
doesn't want us to get it.

15:52.859 --> 15:54.918
We need a distraction
so I can get eyes on it.

15:54.919 --> 15:58.822
Here, take this, and
hold it out of cover.

15:58.823 --> 16:00.858
- You got it?
- Yeah.

16:06.764 --> 16:08.599
Let it go. Let it go!

16:19.477 --> 16:20.477
Damn, it's fast.

16:20.478 --> 16:21.912
What'd you see?

16:21.913 --> 16:24.481
Some kind of ancient archer.

16:24.482 --> 16:27.417
The Talisman must be right
below us in this crypt.

16:27.418 --> 16:28.630
But we can't get down there

16:28.631 --> 16:30.175
with that thing taking potshots at us.

16:30.176 --> 16:32.523
We must have woke it by
poking around with the Scepter.

16:32.524 --> 16:34.024
If it's some kind of guardian,

16:34.025 --> 16:36.360
it won't follow us if we retreat.

16:36.361 --> 16:38.562
If we all run in separate directions,

16:38.563 --> 16:40.931
we might confuse it long
enough to get to safety.

16:40.932 --> 16:42.566
Or end up with arrows in our backs.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.347
Hey, you said you liked
being in the field.

16:46.371 --> 16:48.105
- Right. Then let's do this!
- Yeah?

16:48.106 --> 16:50.207
- You good?
- Good.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.009
Go!

16:55.948 --> 16:58.717
I only caught a glimpse
of it but the Jackal mask

16:58.718 --> 17:01.807
and bronze-tipped arrows
were clearly Egyptian.

17:01.948 --> 17:03.682
Fitting, if this piece of the Talisman

17:03.683 --> 17:05.451
was hidden by Benjamin Banneker.

17:05.452 --> 17:08.579
It sounds territorial, like
a supernatural guard dog.

17:08.579 --> 17:10.122
You're right, it was like we woke it

17:10.123 --> 17:11.690
searching for the Talisman.

17:11.691 --> 17:13.224
It didn't pursue us.

17:13.226 --> 17:16.494
Once we were out of
range, it just let us go.

17:18.064 --> 17:19.431
Wait.

17:21.501 --> 17:23.469
Yes, here.

17:23.470 --> 17:25.103
You faced "a guardian demon"

17:25.104 --> 17:27.445
"of Egyptian descent... a creature used

17:27.446 --> 17:29.308
"by ancient pharaohs
to keep the treasures

17:29.309 --> 17:31.310
"they buried with
them safe from plunder.

17:31.311 --> 17:34.847
A mythical creature
known as the Sphinx."

17:34.848 --> 17:36.114
- Wait.
- Wait.

17:36.115 --> 17:39.351
Even I know that a Sphinx
is a half-human, half-animal

17:39.352 --> 17:41.620
that riddles you with
brain teasers, not arrows.

17:41.621 --> 17:42.788
Not necessarily.

17:42.789 --> 17:44.957
Egyptians tended to anthropomorphize

17:44.958 --> 17:45.991
with their hieroglyphics.

17:45.992 --> 17:47.893
A four-legged Sphinx
statue may have been

17:47.894 --> 17:50.796
a warning that a two-legged
demon with a bow lies below.

17:50.797 --> 17:52.364
I don't care how many legs it has.

17:52.365 --> 17:55.067
How do we put this thing down
so we can get into that crypt?

17:55.068 --> 17:57.903
No, you were right. Generally speaking,

17:57.904 --> 18:00.772
one must solve a riddle in
order to put this creature down.

18:00.773 --> 18:02.508
Maybe we don't need to defeat the Sphinx

18:02.509 --> 18:04.176
to get what we need.

18:04.177 --> 18:07.279
All right, you... now, you said
these lead to a tunnel system?

18:07.280 --> 18:09.181
Like, similar to the
one back home in D.C.?

18:09.182 --> 18:11.183
Yes, Master Wells.

18:11.184 --> 18:14.419
And if this piece of the
Talisman resides in a crypt

18:14.420 --> 18:16.121
beneath the street,

18:16.122 --> 18:19.057
perhaps we can access it from below.

18:19.058 --> 18:20.099
Are you kidding?

18:20.100 --> 18:21.846
We barely escaped that
Sphinx above ground.

18:21.847 --> 18:23.703
We'd be sitting ducks in those tunnels.

18:23.704 --> 18:26.505
Not if we provide a
distraction from above.

18:26.506 --> 18:29.809
We can draw it out again,
keep it occupied long enough

18:29.810 --> 18:32.044
for Crane and Diana
to get into the crypt.

18:32.045 --> 18:35.081
Target practice for a Sphinx.

18:35.082 --> 18:36.422
Still excited about field work?

18:38.085 --> 18:39.552
So Banneker took your advice

18:39.553 --> 18:41.487
and joined the colonial army.

18:41.488 --> 18:44.557
Became one of General
Washington's closest advisors.

18:45.992 --> 18:49.261
However, I was not aware that
this role extended to matters

18:49.262 --> 18:51.497
of supernatural import.

18:53.667 --> 18:56.836
My wife, Katrina... Franklin, Jefferson,

18:56.837 --> 18:57.903
and now Banneker...

18:57.904 --> 19:02.608
all knew the truth of
my role as a Witness.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.678
All were ordered to
keep that truth a secret.

19:05.679 --> 19:07.980
It can't feel good knowing

19:07.981 --> 19:10.483
that such crucial
information was kept from you.

19:10.484 --> 19:13.185
No, it most assuredly does not.

19:13.186 --> 19:17.990
But the past is the past.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.892
There's no point in
wringing one's hands.

19:19.893 --> 19:21.927
And we shall adopt an
altogether different approach

19:21.928 --> 19:23.629
with young Molly.

19:23.630 --> 19:25.664
She will never have to bear the brunt

19:25.665 --> 19:28.834
of a soldier's duty in this matter.

19:28.835 --> 19:30.903
Pro move, Crane.

19:30.904 --> 19:33.906
I ask if it bothers you,
you just change the subject.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.876
I...

19:36.877 --> 19:38.878
Right.

19:38.879 --> 19:40.780
The war against evil is far from over.

19:40.781 --> 19:43.149
There are many more enemies to face,

19:43.150 --> 19:46.986
many more battles to be fought.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.325
This is a road we should not
start down until Miss Jenny

19:53.326 --> 19:55.461
and the others are securely in position

19:55.462 --> 19:56.996
and ready to distract the Sphinx.

19:56.997 --> 19:58.697
Hey, topside, what's your 20?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.966
In position. I'll signal
when I have contact.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.701
Hey, hold up.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.670
I will need you to
hang back by the truck.

20:09.075 --> 20:11.043
So is this some of sort
of pattern with you?

20:11.044 --> 20:13.512
'Cause you went off solo to
Despair's cave to rescue Crane,

20:13.513 --> 20:15.748
and then again to infiltrate
Dreyfuss' building.

20:15.749 --> 20:18.484
Yeah. I'm just quicker
and more mobile on my own.

20:18.485 --> 20:21.067
The plan, your plan, was
to split the demon's focus.

20:21.068 --> 20:23.371
It's not about the plan, she
just doesn't want to babysit.

20:23.372 --> 20:25.891
- We can handle ourselves.
- Really?

20:25.892 --> 20:27.325
'Cause I've had years of experience

20:27.326 --> 20:28.710
dealing with situations like this.

20:28.711 --> 20:30.663
We're not idiots, we get
it. It's a tough game.

20:30.664 --> 20:32.565
People died playing, people
that you really cared about.

20:32.566 --> 20:35.301
But we're not those people. We
have our own reasons for being here,

20:35.302 --> 20:37.667
and we're old enough to
make our own decisions.

20:40.907 --> 20:42.942
I was out of line.

20:42.943 --> 20:45.344
This is my issue, not yours,

20:45.345 --> 20:48.747
and I appreciate you
calling me out on it.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.216
Topside.

20:50.217 --> 20:53.118
Not that I don't love
tunnels, but what's the holdup?

20:53.119 --> 20:55.354
Moving in now. Hold your position.

21:00.360 --> 21:03.462
All right, then...

21:03.463 --> 21:05.164
let's do this.

21:10.971 --> 21:11.971
There he is!

21:11.972 --> 21:14.073
Move!

21:17.210 --> 21:19.278
Bogey sighted.

21:30.624 --> 21:31.724
Here.

21:34.261 --> 21:36.362
As promised,

21:36.363 --> 21:38.764
one Sphinxian riddle.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.566
Can you solve it?

21:40.567 --> 21:42.134
Can I...

21:42.135 --> 21:43.135
Yes, I...

21:43.136 --> 21:45.638
It is a Banneker design.

21:45.639 --> 21:50.042
I'll just need one moment
to translate the cipher.

21:51.278 --> 21:52.845
On your six!

22:08.161 --> 22:09.461
Hey, dogface!

22:10.664 --> 22:13.198
Yo! I got a riddle for you.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.034
What's it gonna be?

22:37.524 --> 22:38.624
Hey, he's weakening.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.027
We must have got the Talisman.

22:54.307 --> 22:55.860
Nice work.

22:55.861 --> 22:57.484
Mission accomplished.

22:57.485 --> 22:59.026
Good job, everyone.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.081
Agent Thomas?

23:02.082 --> 23:03.215
Crane!

23:03.216 --> 23:04.883
Are you all right?

23:04.884 --> 23:06.618
Yes, I'm fine.

23:08.355 --> 23:10.889
Right. I shall guide you through
the Banneker lock mechanism.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.858
It's okay, I think I got it.

23:12.859 --> 23:13.992
Mr. Crane.

23:14.861 --> 23:16.762
Give it here.

23:19.299 --> 23:20.966
Time to go, Witness.

23:28.008 --> 23:29.108
Crane?

23:31.144 --> 23:32.778
Crane!

23:35.300 --> 23:37.825
When the door re-opened,
Crane was just...

23:39.181 --> 23:40.559
gone.

23:42.073 --> 23:44.842
The fact that the last Talisman piece

23:44.843 --> 23:45.943
disappeared along with him

23:45.944 --> 23:47.244
makes a case for the culprit.

23:47.245 --> 23:49.780
Yeah, your friend and
mine, Malcolm Dreyfuss.

23:49.781 --> 23:51.682
No, we were ahead for a minute.

23:51.683 --> 23:53.284
Looks like we just lost our lead.

23:53.285 --> 23:54.618
Hey, not for lack of trying.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.954
You did good.

23:56.955 --> 23:58.923
- Both of you.
- Damn straight.

23:58.924 --> 24:01.125
We're all in this together.
For better or worse.

24:01.126 --> 24:02.426
Right on.

24:02.427 --> 24:03.427
We came into town

24:03.428 --> 24:04.562
to find this Talisman.

24:04.563 --> 24:05.930
If Dreyfuss took it,

24:05.931 --> 24:06.835
and Crane, we could...

24:06.836 --> 24:08.899
Use one to find the other.

24:08.900 --> 24:11.001
Except that we lost the Judas Scepter.

24:12.170 --> 24:13.771
Is there anything else in here

24:13.772 --> 24:16.073
that we can use to track
the Talisman's magic?

24:16.074 --> 24:17.908
I say we go terrestrial.

24:17.909 --> 24:20.544
Dreyfuss has supernatural
allies, but in the end,

24:20.545 --> 24:21.946
he's just a guy.

24:21.947 --> 24:24.152
Dreyfuss Enterprises.

24:24.153 --> 24:26.551
They had a contract to restore the
Lincoln Memorial, right? -

24:26.552 --> 24:27.752
They used it as a smoke screen

24:27.776 --> 24:28.867
to find the first Talisman.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.211
And he also bought the swamplands

24:30.212 --> 24:31.777
around the Dyer sisters' house...

24:31.778 --> 24:33.070
So does Dreyfuss Enterprises

24:33.071 --> 24:35.006
have any similar commercial inroads

24:35.007 --> 24:36.707
in the Sleepy Hollow area?

24:36.708 --> 24:39.477
Three months ago, "a charitable
arm of Dreyfuss Enterprises"

24:39.478 --> 24:41.753
"started a public works
project here in town,

24:41.754 --> 24:44.549
"a commemorative park
located on the site

24:44.550 --> 24:46.884
of a colonial-era battlefield."

24:46.885 --> 24:49.187
Well, that sounds like
a field full of pay dirt.

24:49.188 --> 24:50.755
Hey, hold up.

24:50.756 --> 24:53.724
Dreyfuss isn't gonna be alone out there.

24:53.725 --> 24:55.660
Plus, he's got his
very own personal demon.

24:56.762 --> 24:58.863
We arm up. Go in smart.

24:58.864 --> 25:00.431
All right, then. We got a plan.

25:00.432 --> 25:03.668
Look, let's just hope Crane
can hold out until we get there.

25:33.398 --> 25:35.867
That's right, Mr. Crane.

25:35.868 --> 25:40.638
The Philosopher's Stone is now complete.

25:42.641 --> 25:46.244
Which means you and I, we
really need to have a toast,

25:46.245 --> 25:48.412
don't you think?

25:48.413 --> 25:49.614
Yes.

25:49.615 --> 25:53.384
After two centuries,
this incredible artifact

25:53.385 --> 25:56.053
is finally complete.

25:56.054 --> 26:00.057
Division no longer endures.

26:01.260 --> 26:02.994
Mazel tov.

26:02.995 --> 26:06.564
I'd sooner die than raise my
cups with the likes of you.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.167
Attacking my ego,

26:10.168 --> 26:13.104
that-that's an interesting strategy.

26:13.105 --> 26:17.241
Y-You do realize that virtually
every man of my stature

26:17.242 --> 26:20.044
is by nature necessarily
self-involved, don't you?

26:21.046 --> 26:22.613
I mean, it's not really a flaw,

26:22.614 --> 26:24.382
it's-it's kind of what drives us.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.617
And you do realize this
stone will suck the life

26:26.618 --> 26:28.819
out of every man, woman,
and child in Sleepy Hollow?

26:28.820 --> 26:31.989
Tell me,

26:31.990 --> 26:33.824
what sort of an eternal
life would that be

26:33.825 --> 26:35.927
with that stain on your conscience?

26:35.928 --> 26:39.297
So, innocent people lose their lives

26:39.298 --> 26:42.099
because you're too thick
to read the small print

26:42.100 --> 26:43.301
in your deal with the devil.

26:43.302 --> 26:48.539
I... I had faith
I would find a loophole.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.274
And I did.

26:50.275 --> 26:53.210
And I am more than
grateful to acknowledge

26:53.211 --> 26:55.646
that I owe all of it to you.

26:55.647 --> 26:57.315
That's right.

26:57.316 --> 26:59.483
See, for years I'd spent billions

26:59.484 --> 27:01.886
on-on cryogenics, nanomedicine,

27:01.887 --> 27:03.654
regenerative therapy
and on and on and on.

27:03.655 --> 27:06.157
Then one day, one of
my feelers at the FBI

27:06.158 --> 27:09.060
tells me he got wind of

27:09.061 --> 27:12.496
a 250-year-old man.

27:13.799 --> 27:17.401
I mean, holy sh... ut the front door.

27:17.402 --> 27:19.303
Wowza.

27:19.304 --> 27:20.304
Right?

27:20.305 --> 27:22.940
So you killed Agent Walters.

27:22.941 --> 27:24.675
Pushed me for information.

27:24.676 --> 27:26.210
Why?

27:26.211 --> 27:28.646
I knew nothing of the
Philosopher's Stone.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.514
So...

27:30.515 --> 27:34.819
so are you saying you-you
don't find this stone dais

27:34.820 --> 27:37.288
familiar in any way?

27:39.524 --> 27:43.227
Take a look beneath your feet.

27:43.228 --> 27:44.795
- Yeah, okay.
- You see that shape?

27:44.796 --> 27:47.965
Now imagine blood
flowing down through it.

27:47.966 --> 27:50.668
Mingling on it, if you will.

27:50.669 --> 27:53.437
Didn't you ever wonder
why Washington sent you

27:53.438 --> 27:55.906
to that battlefield to
face the Horseman of Death?

27:55.907 --> 27:58.609
Didn't you wonder how you
were able to cut off his head

27:58.610 --> 28:03.381
so easily back then, but
now, since then, you...

28:03.382 --> 28:06.550
you haven't been able
to harm him at all.

28:08.620 --> 28:12.523
It was the power of
the Philosopher's Stone.

28:14.893 --> 28:17.094
Washington,

28:17.095 --> 28:20.931
he manipulated you.

28:20.932 --> 28:23.267
Used you.

28:23.268 --> 28:26.070
And in the end,

28:26.071 --> 28:27.838
he sacrificed you.

28:40.852 --> 28:43.954
I fought the Horseman of Death

28:43.955 --> 28:47.291
on the Philosopher's Stone.

28:47.292 --> 28:50.327
Yes.

28:50.328 --> 28:53.597
Because your friend and
mentor, George Washington,

28:53.598 --> 28:56.867
he believed, as I happen to believe,

28:56.868 --> 28:59.036
that when the chips come down,

28:59.037 --> 29:03.641
something must be sacrificed

29:03.642 --> 29:05.109
for the greater good.

29:06.712 --> 29:08.245
And by the way,

29:08.246 --> 29:10.214
it might amuse you to know

29:10.215 --> 29:13.551
I found a description
of that fateful night

29:13.552 --> 29:16.087
in Banneker's papers.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.756
And your loyal friend,

29:18.757 --> 29:21.358
he sued your case

29:21.359 --> 29:23.694
with all his heart and soul.

29:23.695 --> 29:25.996
I will not allow this.

29:25.997 --> 29:28.265
It is already done.

29:28.266 --> 29:32.203
And take the chance that Ichabod Crane,

29:32.204 --> 29:34.238
the biblical Witness,

29:34.239 --> 29:35.539
might not survive this battle?

29:35.540 --> 29:37.208
How could you do such a thing?

29:37.209 --> 29:39.076
Because this is war, sir.

29:39.077 --> 29:40.978
And today,

29:40.979 --> 29:43.514
I must risk our most precious asset,

29:43.515 --> 29:45.683
a man I love and trust,

29:45.684 --> 29:48.185
because I have no other choice.

29:58.330 --> 29:59.430
Benjamin!

30:01.099 --> 30:03.534
What good fortune that we should meet.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.104
Is something amiss?

30:07.105 --> 30:10.107
I am tired, Crane.

30:10.108 --> 30:12.743
Before we met,

30:12.744 --> 30:15.346
I was a free man,

30:15.347 --> 30:17.014
beholden to no one.

30:17.015 --> 30:19.517
Now we are both soldiers,

30:19.518 --> 30:23.888
and we must do what we are bade to do.

30:23.889 --> 30:28.993
Whatever mission Washington
has called me here to do,

30:28.994 --> 30:30.227
I will not fail him.

30:30.228 --> 30:31.495
Or you.

30:31.496 --> 30:34.999
Of that I have no doubt, my friend.

30:36.902 --> 30:39.536
Godspeed, Ichabod Crane.

30:44.476 --> 30:47.578
So Washington sent me
to fight the Horseman.

30:50.315 --> 30:52.383
Knowing it would mean my death.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.058
Please.

31:17.409 --> 31:20.044
This is the battlefield.

31:20.045 --> 31:21.545
This is where I died.

31:21.546 --> 31:22.613
Yes.

31:22.614 --> 31:24.815
And fittingly,

31:24.816 --> 31:30.254
this also happens to be where
I will gain eternal life.

31:31.489 --> 31:35.893
Just as soon as
one more guest arrives.

31:50.194 --> 31:51.527
Dreyfuss.

31:51.929 --> 31:54.063
It's not too late to
walk away from this.

31:54.064 --> 31:56.733
Do it.

31:56.734 --> 32:00.136
Walk away with what's
left of your soul intact.

32:00.137 --> 32:02.005
Scalpel.

32:02.006 --> 32:03.673
Scalpel?

32:09.847 --> 32:11.948
I shall anoint this blade.

32:13.617 --> 32:16.619
Mix the blood...

32:16.620 --> 32:19.322
from he who has lived beyond time

32:19.323 --> 32:22.992
with he who is living death.

32:22.993 --> 32:25.962
I ask this great Stone to transform

32:25.963 --> 32:28.998
these two streams...

32:28.999 --> 32:32.869
into the Elixir of Everliving Life.

32:41.245 --> 32:43.112
I got eyes on Dreyfuss.

32:43.113 --> 32:45.181
His demon is with him.

32:45.182 --> 32:46.683
And Crane?

32:46.684 --> 32:49.652
He's in the center
of some kind of altar.

32:49.653 --> 32:52.155
Must be the Philosopher's Stone.

32:57.294 --> 32:58.661
He's not alone.

32:59.730 --> 33:01.531
The Horseman.

33:01.532 --> 33:05.401
Okay. We stick to the plan.

33:05.402 --> 33:08.438
Get in, hit hard, and get out. Clean.

33:35.065 --> 33:37.133
Thank you, Jobe.

33:41.071 --> 33:43.706
Blood of a man from outside his time

33:43.707 --> 33:45.341
who defied the reach of age.

33:49.513 --> 33:53.583
Blood of the Dark Rider of Death...

33:53.584 --> 33:55.685
a true immortal.

33:59.790 --> 34:01.691
As the ceremony begins,

34:01.692 --> 34:04.727
the Stone will require life energy...

34:04.728 --> 34:06.262
the entire town, maybe more.

34:06.263 --> 34:09.031
I've cast an enchantment
that will keep this area

34:09.032 --> 34:10.699
free from the Stone's pull,

34:10.701 --> 34:13.636
an eye in a deadly storm.

34:13.637 --> 34:15.138
Thank you, Jobe.

34:15.139 --> 34:18.174
Every base covered. What
would I do without you?

34:18.175 --> 34:22.011
Now, great Stone,

34:22.012 --> 34:25.748
I call upon your protean power.

34:41.632 --> 34:43.032
Hey, Demon.

34:43.033 --> 34:44.867
You ever seen one of these?

34:44.868 --> 34:46.202
A blessed lantern

34:46.203 --> 34:49.705
brought over from France
in 1778 by Ben Franklin,

34:49.706 --> 34:51.306
made to trap demons.

34:51.308 --> 34:52.975
How handy.

34:59.450 --> 35:01.284
Go! Set the charges.

35:01.285 --> 35:04.520
Hey. Move and I will blow you to hell.

35:04.521 --> 35:06.355
You're welcome to try.

35:08.826 --> 35:10.793
Jobe?

35:18.068 --> 35:19.569
You're not immortal yet.

35:19.570 --> 35:21.604
Jobe!

35:21.605 --> 35:23.406
You are a sight for sore eyes.

35:25.709 --> 35:26.909
Crane!

35:34.351 --> 35:36.919
I thought bullets didn't
work on the Horseman.

35:36.920 --> 35:40.156
The Stone. He's vulnerable on the Stone.

35:40.157 --> 35:41.357
To Hell...

35:41.358 --> 35:43.125
from whence you came.

35:43.126 --> 35:46.028
No!

35:53.971 --> 35:55.104
We good?

35:55.105 --> 35:56.839
- Yeah, we're good.
- Yeah.

35:56.840 --> 35:59.442
Go, go, go! There. Go.

35:59.443 --> 36:02.144
Dreyfuss. Dreyfuss, it's over!

36:16.293 --> 36:18.327
Are they dead?

36:18.328 --> 36:20.296
The Stone drained the life out of them.

36:20.297 --> 36:22.932
Jobe said Dreyfuss is
only safe in his proximity.

36:22.933 --> 36:25.033
Good thing I got him
in my back pocket then.

36:27.204 --> 36:29.705
Do it.

36:36.888 --> 36:38.354
No sign of Dreyfuss.

36:38.355 --> 36:39.922
No sign of the Horseman.

36:39.923 --> 36:42.724
The force of the blast
tore Franklin's lantern

36:42.725 --> 36:47.629
from Miss Jenny's grasp,
but, as always, Lieutenant,

36:47.630 --> 36:51.266
we secured a strong victory.

36:51.267 --> 36:53.869
Fist bump.

36:56.906 --> 37:00.642
And what else is new with the world?

37:00.643 --> 37:02.911
A Hogwarts theme park has opened.

37:02.912 --> 37:05.580
I have ordered a metric ton

37:05.581 --> 37:07.950
of Ravenclaw attire from the Internet.

37:07.951 --> 37:11.820
Mr. Robert Zimmerman
has a fine new studio album.

37:11.821 --> 37:15.324
As for your New York Metropolitans,

37:15.325 --> 37:17.426
this year they have a fierce rivalry

37:17.427 --> 37:21.329
with those grizzly Cubs of Chicago.

37:23.900 --> 37:26.969
Why have I not been
to see you more often?

37:26.970 --> 37:31.106
Well, you always pushed
me to try new things...

37:32.342 --> 37:36.845
so I've moved to Washington, D.C.

37:36.846 --> 37:41.116
I have a new apartment,
new compatriots...

37:41.117 --> 37:43.118
new friends.

37:44.620 --> 37:49.391
Miss Jenny is with me, of course...

37:49.392 --> 37:50.725
as are you...

37:52.195 --> 37:54.796
always.

37:54.797 --> 37:57.332
So, I thought you
might like to know that

37:57.333 --> 37:59.768
whilst I miss you terribly...

38:02.138 --> 38:03.939
I'm not alone.

38:10.646 --> 38:12.681
Until next we meet.

38:16.152 --> 38:19.054
I found a merchant

38:19.055 --> 38:22.457
on Main Street selling these.

38:22.458 --> 38:25.327
A Headless bobblehead.

38:27.263 --> 38:29.231
Wonders never cease.

38:38.908 --> 38:40.342
To absent friends.

38:41.711 --> 38:44.880
To a battle well fought
and a victory well won.

38:44.881 --> 38:45.881
Now drink.

38:50.053 --> 38:52.320
Every single time. How do you do that?

38:52.321 --> 38:54.990
Luck, I imagine, and drink again.

38:54.991 --> 38:56.324
- Gladly.
- Yes, sir.

38:56.325 --> 39:00.362
And this shiny fellow I
shall feed to the jukebox.

39:02.331 --> 39:03.951
You don't want to see what he chooses.

39:14.277 --> 39:15.884
Can't look at your old friend

39:15.885 --> 39:17.579
the same way?

39:17.580 --> 39:19.414
Old?

39:19.415 --> 39:23.318
No, General Washington
made the right decision,

39:23.319 --> 39:25.720
sending me after the
Horseman like he did.

39:27.757 --> 39:30.258
'Twas a sacrifice...

39:30.259 --> 39:33.461
but a sacrifice that may
very well have won the war.

39:37.300 --> 39:39.367
And, of course, if I hadn't

39:39.368 --> 39:42.470
"died," I wouldn't be here today...

39:44.774 --> 39:46.942
wouldn't be a part of this team.

39:51.547 --> 39:52.614
On the house.

39:52.615 --> 39:54.316
You may not have family,

39:54.317 --> 39:55.550
but you are not alone.

39:55.551 --> 39:56.651
I shall drink to that.

39:56.652 --> 39:58.687
That's what we are...

39:58.688 --> 40:00.855
a team.

40:02.222 --> 40:03.725
If you would have told me a month ago

40:03.726 --> 40:04.893
I'd be moonlighting

40:04.894 --> 40:08.463
as a warrior against the supernatural...

40:09.665 --> 40:13.135
mother to the next Witness...

40:13.136 --> 40:16.905
It will require a period of transition.

40:19.375 --> 40:23.378
But we shall ensure Molly's
experience will be far different

40:23.379 --> 40:24.713
to mine and the Lieutenant's.

40:24.714 --> 40:27.816
I'll drink to that.

40:29.519 --> 40:31.820
Well...

40:33.356 --> 40:34.823
Think it's over?

40:34.824 --> 40:39.361
That's the last we'll
hear from Dreyfuss?

40:39.362 --> 40:40.829
I'd like to believe it...

40:42.498 --> 40:46.434
but evil has a manner
of raising its head

40:46.435 --> 40:49.571
in a way we least expect.

40:49.572 --> 40:54.643
But if it should... we
shall face it together.

40:57.180 --> 40:59.714
Team Witness.

41:02.752 --> 41:05.487
Team Witness, indeed.

42:10.453 --> 42:13.121
Yes.

42:13.122 --> 42:15.724
At last.
