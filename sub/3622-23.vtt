02:24.912 --> 02:26.145
Confused.

What is all this?

02:27.948 --> 02:29.414
Go on. Try one.

If you insist.

FATHER:
Ah, the devastation ray.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.888
Wonderful choice.

02:35.890 --> 02:37.356
That's cute, father,

02:37.358 --> 02:39.291
but I think I'm too big to play
with toys now, don't you?

02:39.293 --> 02:41.193
These are not
mere playthings, Junior.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.995
Father, is that
my Honolulu Kyle?

02:42.997 --> 02:43.996
Observe.

02:43.998 --> 02:46.798
The sub-harmonic cannon.

02:47.367 --> 02:49.334
Kyle!

02:50.703 --> 02:52.771
I thought you just said
you were too old for toys.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.307
Kyle isn't a toy.
He's an action figure.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.375
What action?

02:56.377 --> 02:57.776
He dances the bumpa hula.

02:57.778 --> 03:00.012
( <i>sighs</i> )

03:00.014 --> 03:02.347
Junior, these models
are so you can decide

03:02.349 --> 03:05.017
which doomsday device
you want for your birthday.

03:05.019 --> 03:07.252
But father, I don't want
a doomsday anything

03:07.254 --> 03:08.353
for my birthday.

03:08.355 --> 03:10.455
I only want for my dream
to come true.

03:10.457 --> 03:11.990
Your dream?

03:11.992 --> 03:14.293
To take over the world
in some terribly evil way?

03:14.295 --> 03:17.262
No, father.
That is your dream.

03:17.264 --> 03:20.299
My dream is to become an
international pop sensation.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.901
Very well. As a powerful
billionaire,

03:22.903 --> 03:25.237
this should be easy
to accomplish.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.873
But why do something
the easy way

03:27.875 --> 03:30.108
when you can do it the evil way?

You know, for his brains.

Uh-huh, that's not
his brains

03:45.726 --> 03:47.059
he's shaking there, girl.

What's going on?

03:49.230 --> 03:50.295
Ooh! A concert!

03:50.297 --> 03:52.097
Now this brings back
fun memories.

03:52.099 --> 03:53.799
Back in my day, it was...

03:53.801 --> 03:56.401
Well, it doesn't matter
who it was.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.803
It was just like this.

like the Oh Boyz!

No. Tell me.

No, you have to guess.

Hmm.

Okay.

The Oh Boyz are over.
Stick a fork in them.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.173
Done.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.308
Really? But I thought

04:36.310 --> 04:37.843
they were the hottest band
in the land.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.177
Last week.

04:39.179 --> 04:42.047
Nobody would be caught
listening to them anymore.

more people.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.345
I expected some people.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.552
Benny, we have more
caterers than fans.

05:20.554 --> 05:23.288
Roland, do you know how much
money the record company

05:23.290 --> 05:24.823
is losing on this tour?

05:24.825 --> 05:26.892
No, but as the accountant,
I'm sure you'll tell me.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.360
My advice is to cancel

05:28.362 --> 05:29.828
and cut your losses.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.197
The boys have lawyers.
No cancellation clause.

05:32.199 --> 05:34.032
Ooh, right.
The contract.

It doesn't bother you
that you're into a band

05:50.250 --> 05:51.316
that is so over?

05:51.318 --> 05:53.518
They're not over for me.
They rock.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.455
I used to think so too,
but I mean, come on, Ron.

05:56.457 --> 05:57.522
Look around.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.858
Nobody is into them anymore.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.194
Kim, who cares about
everybody else?

Ron Stoppable does not follow
trends, he sets trends.

them to autograph Rufus.

Just wait, Rufus.

I'm going to show the Oh Boyz

06:17.444 --> 06:19.411
how I've learned all
their dance steps.

They probably love it
when fans dance for them.

Roland, this is
all your fault, yo!

There were pickles
all over my plate.

06:45.406 --> 06:47.239
Ryan, maybe you had
Dexter's plate.

06:47.241 --> 06:48.273
Have you considered that?

06:48.275 --> 06:50.075
I did not have Dexter's plate.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.144
You think I don't know
my own plate?

the record company

taking care of us?

You've got nothing
to worry about, sir.

be back in no time.

That's right.

08:29.476 --> 08:30.509
I'd help no matter what,

08:30.511 --> 08:32.077
but they got
my best friend, too.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.079
This is <i>way</i> personal.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.080
It is hopeless.

08:35.082 --> 08:36.681
My dream will never come true.

soon be a reality.

Robby the cute one.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.261
Nicky Nick the funny one.

08:49.263 --> 08:50.262
And...

08:50.264 --> 08:51.329
Uh-oh.

08:51.331 --> 08:52.631
I don't know this one,

08:52.633 --> 08:54.432
and yet he rings a bell in me.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.234
What?
He's not one of...

08:56.236 --> 08:58.336
The new Oh Boy.
The other one.

09:02.842 --> 09:05.310
Yes, I remember him now.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.213
He's obviously
carrying the others.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.681
It looks like we have no choice

09:09.683 --> 09:11.750
but to cancel tomorrow's
opening gig.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.485
What's the dollar damage, Benny?

09:13.487 --> 09:14.753
Well, not so damaging.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.755
Really?
Yeah. We were losing money

09:16.757 --> 09:18.590
on shows when nobody showed up.

09:18.592 --> 09:20.191
The Oh Boyz showed up.

09:20.193 --> 09:23.428
Exactly... and we had to
pay them, their bodyguards,

09:23.430 --> 09:26.131
their hair stylists,
their aura cleansers.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.265
Oh, boy.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.500
Right.
So we don't lose

09:28.502 --> 09:30.101
any money anymore...
this is a good thing.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.236
What's a good thing?

09:31.238 --> 09:32.804
That we have you to help us.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.205
Have there been any demands?

09:34.207 --> 09:35.574
Not since
the Oh Boyz were taken.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.275
I meant from whoever
captured them.

09:37.277 --> 09:40.245
No, nothing yet, but I'll
keep you on speed dial.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.147
But I never gave you my digits.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.516
Okay. Must've been some
other teen who means well.

09:44.518 --> 09:45.817
What was the number again?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.452
If the record company wishes

09:47.454 --> 09:49.754
to have their precious
Oh Boyz back,

09:49.756 --> 09:51.389
they will bow to my demand.

09:51.391 --> 09:53.425
What is your demand, father?

09:53.427 --> 09:56.394
That they make you an
international pop sensation.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.629
( <i>excited squeal</i> )

09:57.631 --> 09:59.864

Please, please, please!

09:59.866 --> 10:01.766
As you wish, my boy.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.168
We're in trouble.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.736
Nobody is going to give
Junior a record deal.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.371
We have nothing to worry about.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.506
Roland will give these jokers
anything to get us back.

10:08.508 --> 10:09.841
A day without the Oh Boyz

10:09.843 --> 10:12.143
is like a day
where I don't lose money.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.212
No more whining pop rats.

10:21.321 --> 10:23.855
Call my office,
we'll set a thing. Bye now.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.858
Was I not clear in my demands?

10:26.860 --> 10:29.494
What I don't get is why would
anybody take them?

10:29.496 --> 10:31.896
Everyone knows that
they're over except Ron.

10:31.898 --> 10:34.199
That's the weird part, Kim.
They were over.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.467

The Oh Boyz are hotter

Their CDs are selling out

When octopi are mutated,

certain traits get amplified.

18:41.988 --> 18:44.655

Wade, short version please.

Oh, yeah.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.461
He was very worried about you.

Um, about that...

20:00.233 --> 20:02.800
Enough. You are all testing

Junior, are you all right?

20:27.961 --> 20:30.962
Do I look tanner now?

20:30.964 --> 20:32.163
Because the pain
may be worth it.
