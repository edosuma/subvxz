that Brad couldn't have
his beach vacation.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.261
Yeah, it's basically
the same thing.

18:26.564 --> 18:27.929
Is that-- Is that cat poop?

18:28.232 --> 18:29.393
Probably. We brought this in

18:29.692 --> 18:31.399
from the neighbor's
backyard sandbox.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.152

So, Maxey,

18:35.865 --> 18:37.697
the charity event
was a huge success.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.359
We got the most donations
even though a lot of kids

18:40.661 --> 18:42.868
were scarred by seeing
Santa do a perp walk.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.404
Don't care. Yeah.
Really?

18:44.707 --> 18:45.742
Because I think

18:46.042 --> 18:47.498
you sort of enjoyed
being Santa.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.206
Ugh. Fine. I'll go upstairs,
put on the Santa costume,

18:51.505 --> 18:53.496
come back with presents
for everyone. What?

18:53.799 --> 18:55.460
I'll get my guitar,
sing the rock songs

18:55.760 --> 18:57.296

about Christmas.

18:57.595 --> 18:58.676
Nobody's asking you to.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.678
Then I'll march my tush
in the kitchen

19:00.973 --> 19:03.465
and make some soup
because I'm just made of time.

19:03.768 --> 19:06.305
We're all set.

You didn't ruin it, all right?

all the coupons.
