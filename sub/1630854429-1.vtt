01:55.633 --> 02:02.633
We give thanks for the gift
of King T'Challa.

02:03.675 --> 02:08.300
The Black Panther.

02:09.633 --> 02:12.633
Son of King T'Chaka.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.216
My son.

02:14.383 --> 02:19.716
Descendant of the venerable
king Bashenga,

02:20.300 --> 02:22.675
the first Black Panther.

02:23.091 --> 02:24.925
We release you.

02:25.133 --> 02:27.175
Praised be the ancestors.

07:18.758 --> 07:25.800
France knows that Vibranium can be used
to make weapons of mass destruction.

07:26.133 --> 07:29.716
It does not activate
any known metal detectors.

07:30.841 --> 07:36.216
It is a threat to global security and
the non-proliferation treaty.

08:16.675 --> 08:18.091
I lost the security cameras.

08:22.675 --> 08:25.383
Everybody on the ground, now!

08:25.466 --> 08:27.008
Face down! Fast!

08:27.175 --> 08:29.341
Where are the Vibranium tools?

08:33.508 --> 08:34.216
Who has access?

10:52.883 --> 10:54.466
On your knees!

10:58.050 --> 10:59.300
You're welcome.

17:04.800 --> 17:05.883
Go!

19:21.800 --> 19:23.508
My queen.

32:36.008 --> 32:37.300
My queen,

35:54.675 --> 35:55.591
My queen.

36:15.008 --> 36:16.466
Yes, my queen.

46:17.341 --> 46:18.341
Oh!

48:12.133 --> 48:13.341
Kill the scientist.

48:13.466 --> 48:15.133
I'll take care of the witnesses.

48:15.675 --> 48:16.383
Understood.

48:21.175 --> 48:22.925
Kill that woman first.

48:59.133 --> 49:01.216
Go to Namora.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.758
You are not worthy of my weapon.

50:25.341 --> 50:26.925
Why are you taking so long?

50:27.258 --> 50:29.925
There is no time for games.

53:48.591 --> 53:49.758
Do you allow me to speak... 

53:49.925 --> 53:50.716
my queen?

53:53.633 --> 53:55.091
I beg you

54:03.466 --> 54:05.466
I ask you, mother.

58:22.758 --> 58:23.716
Hello.

58:30.300 --> 58:31.925
Did you come to see the headmistress?

58:39.258 --> 58:40.091
She is over there.

58:40.966 --> 58:42.758
Very good.

58:50.300 --> 58:51.133
Hello.

58:57.258 --> 59:00.800
Please give us a moment.

59:05.466 --> 59:06.133
Hello.

59:06.550 --> 59:07.091
Hello.

59:07.216 --> 59:08.133
Hello.

01:00:23.550 --> 01:00:24.841
Thank you.

01:00:39.383 --> 01:00:41.300
That was a long time ago

01:01:28.550 --> 01:01:29.508
Princess.

01:01:30.716 --> 01:01:32.841
Here the royalty wear traditional clothes.

01:01:33.258 --> 01:01:35.425
We made it for you.

01:02:03.050 --> 01:02:04.050
Come with me.

01:02:21.883 --> 01:02:22.550
Do you want to eat?

01:02:36.925 --> 01:02:40.425
-Hello lady. Nice to meet you.
-How can I help you?

01:02:41.258 --> 01:02:44.258
My name is Maria Aldaña.
I am a student from Mérida.

01:02:44.258 --> 01:02:46.258
I'm not interested,
please go away

01:02:46.258 --> 01:02:50.508
Yes of course. I don't want to disturb you.
Can you give me just a moment

01:02:50.508 --> 01:02:53.175
Is that my professor mentioned a study,

01:02:53.175 --> 01:02:55.425
where you told some researchers,

01:02:55.425 --> 01:02:57.841
you had an encounter with something,

01:02:57.841 --> 01:02:59.758
with someone amazing.

01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:04.175
Nothing good came from talking to those strangers.

01:03:04.175 --> 01:03:06.800
-But, please.
-Go away now.

01:03:08.508 --> 01:03:10.633
I met him too.

01:03:22.008 --> 01:03:23.800
Sometimes we saw a man,

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:26.508
with wings on his feet,

01:03:27.300 --> 01:03:29.383
walking along the shore of the sea.

01:03:29.841 --> 01:03:31.758
We thought it was a spirit

01:03:32.133 --> 01:03:37.050
Ku’ku’lkán,
our the Feathered Serpent God.

01:03:37.633 --> 01:03:40.633
Of that kingdom
and from the kingdom below.

01:03:41.508 --> 01:03:43.841
I would really like to go to that beach.

01:03:44.966 --> 01:03:46.300
But i warn you.

01:03:46.341 --> 01:03:52.841
Ku'ku'klan, has been here
much longer than you or me.

01:03:52.883 --> 01:03:56.841
Others who searched for him
with evil in their heart,

01:03:56.925 --> 01:03:58.508
didn't return.

01:03:59.216 --> 01:04:03.133
Stay lost in the deep forever.

01:06:24.383 --> 01:06:25.591
No. My baby.

01:06:36.508 --> 01:06:38.466
Your baby is sick.

01:06:39.008 --> 01:06:40.758
Only this will heal him.

01:06:41.216 --> 01:06:44.883
Your baby will be the first to be born
in our new home.

01:06:46.466 --> 01:06:47.716
Take this gift as a promise...

01:06:47.841 --> 01:06:51.383
He will be our new king.

01:07:37.925 --> 01:07:39.050
Let's go!

01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.591
Who is that kid?

01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:56.716
You have been summoned...

01:19:56.883 --> 01:19:58.091
K'uk'ulkan.

01:23:38.841 --> 01:23:40.216
Drop your spear!

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:41.800
Kill the princess!

01:23:47.841 --> 01:23:49.216
Drop the knife.

01:23:49.925 --> 01:23:50.633
You...

01:23:51.425 --> 01:23:52.591
You killed her.

01:23:53.425 --> 01:23:54.758
Let her go

01:23:54.925 --> 01:23:56.925
and you won't have to die.

01:24:01.883 --> 01:24:03.508
Move your left arm

01:25:15.966 --> 01:25:17.258
You're welcome.

01:25:25.883 --> 01:25:27.758
What happened, my girl?

01:25:29.675 --> 01:25:31.550
The Wakandians.

01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.133
They came for her.

01:25:36.716 --> 01:25:38.800
K'uk'ulkan...

01:25:41.258 --> 01:25:44.758
can you save me?

01:25:58.050 --> 01:25:59.466
Is she dead?

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:02.925
Yes.

01:26:11.550 --> 01:26:13.883
Rest, my child.

01:26:16.425 --> 01:26:17.841
Did they came...

01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:22.258
while you were talking with the queen?

01:26:23.675 --> 01:26:27.091
We shouldn't have trusted her.

01:26:27.800 --> 01:26:30.800
The princess has seen our home.

01:26:31.258 --> 01:26:33.466
What will prevent them...

01:26:33.883 --> 01:26:36.008
from attacking Talokan?

01:26:38.258 --> 01:26:39.550
I will do it.

01:27:14.383 --> 01:27:15.841
Rise Talokan!

01:27:18.341 --> 01:27:19.966
Rise Talokan!

01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:27.300
I was blinded...

01:27:27.508 --> 01:27:28.841
by hope...

01:27:29.008 --> 01:27:30.675
of partership.

01:27:32.633 --> 01:27:33.633
And...

01:27:34.258 --> 01:27:36.508
I have compromised

01:27:37.091 --> 01:27:39.216
all of us.

01:27:40.008 --> 01:27:41.133
Talokan...

01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:43.008
will not move

01:27:43.175 --> 01:27:44.591
again.

01:27:45.675 --> 01:27:46.591
Namora.

01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:48.550
Attuma.

01:27:50.675 --> 01:27:53.675
When we are done with them...

01:27:56.591 --> 01:27:58.925
they will never think...

01:27:59.091 --> 01:28:01.133
of approaching...

01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:02.758
Talokan!

01:28:05.133 --> 01:28:06.466
Rise Talokan!

01:30:10.508 --> 01:30:11.508
Thank you, sister.

01:31:42.091 --> 01:31:43.008
Take care of him.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:53.383
Turn around!  Turn around!

01:33:02.883 --> 01:33:04.050
Take the boy.

01:34:02.675 --> 01:34:04.258
Warrior!

01:34:07.633 --> 01:34:08.258
...my child.

01:34:14.258 --> 01:34:15.133
Yes.

01:34:15.591 --> 01:34:16.591
We'll find your mom, okay?

01:34:17.466 --> 01:34:19.466
We'll find your mom, okay?

01:34:34.133 --> 01:34:36.800
The defenses have moved away from the palace.

01:34:37.091 --> 01:34:39.133
Now it's up to you.

01:35:58.216 --> 01:35:58.800
Help!

01:35:59.758 --> 01:36:00.258
Help!

01:38:45.258 --> 01:38:45.966
Help the child.

01:39:08.550 --> 01:39:09.383
Come on, my queen.

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:47.966
Wake up, my queen.

01:39:50.091 --> 01:39:51.258
Let me see.

01:39:52.008 --> 01:39:52.883
Wake up.

01:40:00.175 --> 01:40:01.383
Wake up, mother.

01:40:02.008 --> 01:40:03.258
She already died.

01:48:59.925 --> 01:49:01.716
Listen to me.

01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:33.841
Hello, Suri.

01:51:36.758 --> 01:51:37.966
You did it!

01:52:33.716 --> 01:52:35.091
Ramonda.

01:52:35.466 --> 01:52:40.466
We beg you to come to your daughter.

01:56:23.216 --> 01:56:24.425
Are you okay?

01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:38.800
What happened?

02:00:46.925 --> 02:00:47.466
Yes.

02:00:48.091 --> 02:00:48.841
Yes.

02:03:43.716 --> 02:03:44.716
Breathe.

02:04:17.341 --> 02:04:24.091
K'uk'ulkan, they are using another 
vibranium detector machine in the ocean.

02:04:25.091 --> 02:04:26.175
Where?

02:04:55.425 --> 02:04:56.633
Get out of the water!

02:11:35.050 --> 02:11:36.591
Sink the ship!

02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:11.883
Warrior!

02:13:15.341 --> 02:13:17.633
Do you speak the mother tongue?

02:13:17.966 --> 02:13:20.300
You will be able to greet your ancestors with it...

02:14:08.133 --> 02:14:11.550
You will greet your ancestors..

02:15:21.175 --> 02:15:22.675
I need water.

02:16:31.466 --> 02:16:33.883
Imperius Rex.

02:19:12.674 --> 02:19:14.424
I surrender.

02:19:39.383 --> 02:19:41.549
Talokanils!

02:19:43.466 --> 02:19:45.008
Let's go home.

02:19:45.549 --> 02:19:46.966
Our fight here is over.

02:23:55.175 --> 02:23:56.883
What worries you, my girl?

02:23:58.716 --> 02:24:05.758
All my life I wanted to fight by your side...

02:24:06.675 --> 02:24:11.800
The idea of ​​you kneeling
before the Wakandians...

02:24:12.133 --> 02:24:17.008
The Black Panther had
many reasons to kill me.

02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:20.966
Why do you think she didn't do it?

02:24:22.758 --> 02:24:27.300
The Black Panther is
the most powerful person...

02:24:27.633 --> 02:24:33.383
of the most powerful nation
of the surface.

02:24:33.591 --> 02:24:36.633
But she doesnt have allies.

02:24:36.966 --> 02:24:41.591
Now she feels empathy
for the people of Talokan.

02:24:43.383 --> 02:24:45.508
With this alliance...

02:24:46.175 --> 02:24:53.216
Talokan will be stronger than ever.

02:24:53.633 --> 02:24:57.550
The surface world will go for Wakanda.

02:24:58.341 --> 02:25:01.341
and Wakanda will come to us.

02:25:02.883 --> 02:25:04.550
Trust me.

02:26:00.800 --> 02:26:01.591
Let's go.

02:26:28.716 --> 02:26:29.550
Thank you.

02:26:29.758 --> 02:26:30.425
It was nothing

02:26:37.758 --> 02:26:39.300
Welcome!

02:33:17.133 --> 02:33:18.341
Who are you?
