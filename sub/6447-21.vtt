-How many times do I have to apologize?
-I don't want an apology.

-What the hell were you so afraid of?
-You.

It'll be okay, Tommy. I promise.

00:13.514 --> 00:16.096
How could you do this to me?
Just stay away.

00:17.976 --> 00:21.389
I want to introduce you to some people,
a sort of team.

Lex deserved to die, Chloe.

00:28.570 --> 00:31.027
-This is murder.
-You know what I did was right.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.113
You can't tell Clark.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.111
-I will do anything for you.
-Let's leave Smallville.

You wait for the team to move in.

Well, you seem to be taking
my open-door policy...

01:05.023 --> 01:07.309
...a little liberally these days, don't you?

01:07.484 --> 01:09.520
I assumed after you ambushed me
in my barn...

01:09.695 --> 01:13.813
...and accused me of being an alien Jesus
that we had dropped any formalities.

01:15.159 --> 01:18.993
You know, I can't say
that the sarcasm adds to your coy charm...

Okay, then, tell me.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.172
What's on your mind, Clark?

01:29.673 --> 01:33.086
Do you really think that spreading panic
is responsible journalism?

01:33.260 --> 01:36.297
Making Davis Bloome
front-page news every day is reckless.

01:36.472 --> 01:38.303
Reckless?

01:39.391 --> 01:44.511
Well, I think reckless is not doing everything
in your power to stop him.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.347
Starting a massive manhunt
isn't helping anyone.

01:48.525 --> 01:52.063
Clark, if you don't want to admit
your true identity, that's ﬁne.

01:52.321 --> 01:55.063
But we both know that Davis Bloome...

01:55.407 --> 01:57.318
...isn't a man.

01:59.203 --> 02:00.693
He's a beast.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.032
If he is this beast...

02:03.207 --> 02:06.415
...then encouraging the police
to go after him is dangerous.

02:06.585 --> 02:07.700
People will die.

...why are you ﬁghting my help, hmm?

02:44.748 --> 02:48.912
Maybe it's because you're actually afraid
to ﬁnd Davis.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.664
Because the pure

I thought I'd ﬁnally ﬁgured out the whole

to reveal a few missing Kryptonian pieces.

The difference...

40:04.652 --> 40:07.143
