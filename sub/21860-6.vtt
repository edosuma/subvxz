(screaming)

00:06.674 --> 00:08.442
ANNOUNCER:
American Horror Story: Cult.

00:08.476 --> 00:10.778
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.114 --> 00:15.749
ANNOUNCER:
FX presents Better Things.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.188
* Mother

00:20.221 --> 00:23.657
* You had me

00:23.691 --> 00:26.360
* But I never had you

00:28.529 --> 00:30.331
*

00:32.566 --> 00:36.437
* I wanted you

00:38.072 --> 00:41.041
* You didn't want me.

00:41.075 --> 00:43.043
*

00:45.579 --> 00:48.849
* Let 'em get high

00:48.882 --> 00:52.353
* Let 'em unload
(loudly exhaling)

00:52.386 --> 00:55.223
* Everything

00:55.256 --> 00:59.360
* Will be all right
if you let it go *

00:59.393 --> 01:01.662
* Let 'em get high

01:01.695 --> 01:03.831
* Let 'em unload...

01:03.864 --> 01:07.067
Okay, so... maybe
I'm not perfect.

01:07.101 --> 01:08.802
I make mistakes.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.304
I'm weak.

01:10.338 --> 01:12.640
So maybe there's
a million other guys

01:12.673 --> 01:13.874
who would've done
better than me.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.009
But you chose
to be with me.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.379
So you're saying
this is my fault?

01:18.412 --> 01:21.382
Oh, my God. All I've ever tried
to do is just be the...

01:21.415 --> 01:22.383
SAM:
Nuh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

01:22.416 --> 01:23.984
uh, uh. Hold on.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.686
You're getting there too easy.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.155
Too easy?
Yeah.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.889
I don't want to know

01:28.922 --> 01:30.724
how you're gonna react.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.993
You shouldn't know it.
That's not how people are.

01:33.026 --> 01:36.096
Where is all this confidence
coming from?

01:36.130 --> 01:38.065
It's poison for this scene.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.067
Throw it away.

01:40.100 --> 01:42.536
Cut it out.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.273
Don't cry.
I love you. Jaia.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.541
You got to toughen up.
Believe me,

01:47.575 --> 01:48.576
this is nothing.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.278
You got to toughen up in life

01:50.311 --> 01:52.045
and get weaker in the scenes.

01:52.079 --> 01:53.046
Okay?

01:53.080 --> 01:54.047
Okay.

01:54.081 --> 01:55.383
(clears throat)
Okay.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.917
And Wong...
Wong...

01:56.950 --> 01:58.452
you're boring.

01:58.486 --> 02:00.221
That's all. Work on it.

02:00.254 --> 02:02.723
Move your arms around or
something; I'm falling asleep.

02:04.158 --> 02:05.426
Sure, Sam.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.660
SAM:
Okay. (groans)

02:06.694 --> 02:08.362
Let's get Henry
and Josh up here.

02:08.396 --> 02:10.498
Come on, guys,
show us the gay version.

02:14.402 --> 02:15.836
And maybe there are
a million different guys

02:15.869 --> 02:17.137
that-that would have
been better

02:17.171 --> 02:20.274
for you, but you chose me.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.443
You chose me.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.212
I chose you?

02:24.245 --> 02:25.846
I chose someone who
was gonna be with me,

02:25.879 --> 02:28.349
who was gonna love me.
A-And do the right things.

02:28.382 --> 02:30.050
That's what I chose.

02:30.083 --> 02:31.785
I didn't choose someone
who was gonna run out on me.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.988
J... I'm sorry, okay?
I-I...

02:35.022 --> 02:38.626
Sorry? Yeah.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.662
See? I always
like the gay version better.
(all laugh)

02:41.695 --> 02:44.097
* My friends are so alone

02:44.131 --> 02:46.033
* And it breaks my heart

02:48.636 --> 02:50.738
* And my friends
don't understand... *

02:50.771 --> 02:52.340
(groans)

02:52.373 --> 02:54.342
Okay, so when he says,

02:54.375 --> 02:57.445
"I'm not perfect"...

02:57.478 --> 02:58.679
what is that?

02:58.712 --> 03:01.048
Why does he say that?
Why?

03:01.081 --> 03:03.150
Because this is shitty writing.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.086
That's why. That's
the only reason.

03:06.119 --> 03:07.488
But, look, most of the work

03:07.521 --> 03:09.122
you're gonna be given
as actors--

03:09.156 --> 03:10.524
it's gonna be shitty writing.

03:10.558 --> 03:12.493
Do you think
you're gonna walk out of here

03:12.526 --> 03:14.762
and get a job doing
a Quentin Tarantino monologue,

03:14.795 --> 03:16.630
like, straight
out of the gate?

03:16.664 --> 03:17.665
No.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.501
At best, 90%
of the words

03:20.534 --> 03:22.536
that you're gonna read
are gonna suck

03:22.570 --> 03:25.706
and have no
real feeling behind it.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.576
Anyone can do a scene
that's well-written.

03:28.609 --> 03:30.978
The skill you're
gonna need,

03:31.011 --> 03:32.846
if you want to really work,

03:32.880 --> 03:34.682
and get steady work--

03:34.715 --> 03:38.486
as steady as you can, anyway--

03:38.519 --> 03:41.689
is to make shitty writing
mean something.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.725
To elevate the work.

03:44.758 --> 03:47.995
If you can take a bad script
and make it work,

03:48.028 --> 03:50.163
they'll keep hiring you.

03:50.197 --> 03:52.766
Okay?
Good job, you guys.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.835
Okay, let's hear it for them.
Clear this out.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.037
MAN:
I'm not paying for this.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.906
You already paid for it.
This isn't what I ordered.

03:58.939 --> 03:59.940
Okay, look, I'm not perfect,

03:59.973 --> 04:01.675
okay? I-I'm weak.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.411
I can't
hold this all day.
But there are a million

04:03.444 --> 04:04.878
taco trucks out there.
Look at it. You made this.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.246
And you chose mine.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.748
Okay?
I did. I did.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.317
Yeah, you did.
Yeah, I did.
But you know what?

04:09.350 --> 04:10.318
What?
I want a divorce.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.319
Oh, you got it.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.323
Oh, fucking comedians.

04:15.356 --> 04:18.592
You guys, the problem is
you're great performers.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.294
That's a problem?

04:20.328 --> 04:21.929
Yes, it is.
For an actor.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.831
No character you're
ever gonna play

04:23.864 --> 04:25.699
is gonna sound
like that.

04:25.733 --> 04:27.368
You're playing a person
in this scene.

04:27.401 --> 04:29.036
People are weak.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.271
They're not cool and fast.

04:31.305 --> 04:34.274
What are your
assets as an actor?

04:34.308 --> 04:36.243
Your weaknesses.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.713
Whatever your fears are,
whatever you suck at,

04:39.747 --> 04:41.915
that's what you got to tap.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.117
That's what people
want to see

04:44.151 --> 04:46.286
when you're playing people.

04:46.320 --> 04:50.257
They want to see you
at your weakest.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.261
They don't want to watch some
asshole comedian show off.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.365
They want to see him fail.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.799
That's acting.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.168
* Let 'em get high

05:01.201 --> 05:04.938
* Let 'em unload

05:04.972 --> 05:07.775
* Everything will be all right

05:07.808 --> 05:11.178
* If you let it go

05:11.211 --> 05:13.881
* Let 'em get high

05:13.914 --> 05:17.618
* Let 'em unload

05:17.651 --> 05:22.523
* Everything will be all right
if you let it go. *

05:27.294 --> 05:31.198
(imitates engine revving,
tires screeching)

05:34.334 --> 05:35.969
Can I drive now?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.439
Cut. Reset.
(bell rings)

05:38.472 --> 05:40.307
Back to one.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.443
How many is that?
Oh, I think, 12.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.445
Ooh, fun.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.113
Well, you know, at least
you're not spitting

05:46.146 --> 05:48.749
and making noises.
My lips are numb.

05:48.782 --> 05:51.519
Joe. You're killing it.
You're doing great.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.020
Good looking out.
You bodied that.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.155
Hey, sorry, guys.
Uh, the car folks

05:55.188 --> 05:57.157
are making a couple
of adjustments, cool?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.560
That's all right.
At least we're sitting down.

05:59.593 --> 06:01.395
(chuckles)

06:01.429 --> 06:03.096
All right,
let's go again.
Okay. (clears throat)

06:03.130 --> 06:05.198
Here we go.
Rolling.

06:05.232 --> 06:08.335
And...

06:08.368 --> 06:10.370
action.
(imitates engine revving,
tires screeching)

06:12.372 --> 06:14.708
Can I drive now?

06:14.742 --> 06:15.843
Cut.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.511
Reset.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.447
Okay, everybody settle.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.914
Quick,
quick, quick.
Oh.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.917
All right, here we go.
And... rolling.

06:23.951 --> 06:25.453
Action.

06:25.486 --> 06:28.689
(imitates engine revving,
tires screeching)

06:31.358 --> 06:32.460
Can I drive now?

06:32.493 --> 06:33.727
Cut!

06:33.761 --> 06:35.496
(bell rings)
Reset.

06:35.529 --> 06:37.164
(sighs)
Okay.

06:38.365 --> 06:40.167
Could I, um, get some water...

06:40.200 --> 06:41.469
Yeah, sure.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.472
...that's really vodka?
Count me in.

06:44.505 --> 06:46.874
Here we go. Rolling. Action.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.909
(imitates engine revving)

06:51.411 --> 06:53.547
(imitates tires screeching)

06:53.581 --> 06:55.348
Can I drive now?

06:55.382 --> 06:56.850
Cut.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.185
Reset. Back to one.

06:58.218 --> 06:59.620
Is there anything different

06:59.653 --> 07:01.855
that you want from me?

07:01.889 --> 07:03.524
Anything...
No, you're fine.
Yeah, mm-hmm.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.893
(deep voice):
Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

07:05.926 --> 07:09.029
Yeah. This is, like, uh...
Groundhog Day.

07:09.062 --> 07:10.564
Like, a 20-second version.

07:10.598 --> 07:12.533
Also, it's longer.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.734
(chuckles)
And not quite as funny.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.735
All right, so
let's go again.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.903
(laughs)

07:15.936 --> 07:17.037
(bell rings)

07:17.070 --> 07:19.106
Think Macbeth,
all right?
Okay.

07:19.139 --> 07:22.442
You know, it's, like,
this car is your mom.
Okay.

07:22.476 --> 07:23.944
*

07:23.977 --> 07:26.614
So which act would this be,
Act V, Act III?
No, Act II.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.048
Act II?
Obviously.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.382
So it's still setting it up.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.751
Yeah, of course,
of course.
Okay.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.352
*

07:32.385 --> 07:33.721
No. It's..

07:33.754 --> 07:35.122
If I said...

07:35.155 --> 07:37.257
Look, I didn't mean
anything like that.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.292
Really?
I don't think...

07:39.326 --> 07:41.795
Baby, uh, this is--
really isn't the time.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.096
I mean...

07:43.130 --> 07:44.765
I'm-- come on, Sam.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.601
*

07:51.939 --> 07:53.106
Ooh, look at the pineapple.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.308
Oh, I want
some of that.
(Sam sighs)

07:55.342 --> 07:57.745
Hey, would you
step out, please?
Oh. Sure.

07:57.778 --> 08:00.147
Ha-ha.
Fired, or...

08:00.180 --> 08:02.149
just... free?
MECHANIC:
Thank you.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.651
Bring back supplies.

08:03.684 --> 08:05.619
Oh.
Oh, man.

08:05.653 --> 08:07.020
Okay, yeah.

08:07.054 --> 08:09.222
Yeah, it was
definitely the hood

08:09.256 --> 08:11.725
that was part of the problem.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.962
Is this the worst job you've
ever had in your life?

08:14.995 --> 08:16.597
Huh? What? No, dude.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.098
No, no, no, no, no.

08:18.131 --> 08:19.767
Okay, what was
the worst?

08:19.800 --> 08:21.702
Okay, so, I was making
this horror movie,

08:21.735 --> 08:24.371
Mm-hmm.
and, uh, my boyfriend
turns into this,

08:24.404 --> 08:26.106
like, purple monster,

08:26.139 --> 08:28.441
and his hand reaches down
and grabs me, pulls me up

08:28.475 --> 08:30.644
to the ceiling...
JAIMYON: All right,
that's clear! Let's go again!

08:30.678 --> 08:32.345
O... kay.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.947
Here we go.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.149
Everybody
at one.
Oh, my-- Joe.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.384
(laughing)

08:38.518 --> 08:39.486
Wow.

08:39.519 --> 08:40.754
Action.
Okay.

08:40.788 --> 08:44.357
(imitating engine roaring,
tires squealing)

08:44.391 --> 08:46.526
Can I drive now?

08:46.560 --> 08:48.128
(imitates tires
screeching)

08:48.161 --> 08:49.663
Can I drive now?

08:49.697 --> 08:50.998
(imitates tires
screeching)

08:51.031 --> 08:53.000
Can I drive now?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.134
Can I drive now?

08:54.167 --> 08:55.869
Can I drive now?

08:55.903 --> 08:57.705
(bell rings)
Cut! Cut! Reset!

08:57.738 --> 09:00.674
(speaking indistinctly)

09:00.708 --> 09:02.342
I thought
that was the one.
Yeah.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.877
Ooh.
Okay.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.545
So...

09:05.579 --> 09:08.315
see that, uh,
woman over there?

09:08.348 --> 09:10.851
SAM: The blonde one?
They want to do a version
with you and her.

09:10.884 --> 09:14.221
What?
And at the end,
they want you to kiss.

09:14.254 --> 09:17.057
Wha...
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.

09:17.090 --> 09:20.227
(laughing):
I got you!
Ha! That was good!

09:20.260 --> 09:21.929
(laughing)
You got excited.

09:21.962 --> 09:23.496
I got e...
Yeah, yeah,

09:23.530 --> 09:26.399
you're wrapped,
you're wrapped.
I am?

09:26.433 --> 09:27.835
We're wrapped, baby!
Ah, wrapped.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.202
No, not you, Joe.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.538
Oh.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.040
I love you.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.342
Mwah! I love
you, too.
That was so fun.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.377
Okay.
We'll catch
up soon.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.545
Thanks for the job.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.013
No problem. All right.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.415
Let's go. Everybody
else back to one.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.583
Run like the wind!

09:46.854 --> 09:48.656
WOMAN: Scarlet attends
Stanford University,

09:48.689 --> 09:50.390
where she is a sophomore

09:50.423 --> 09:53.593
and well on her way
to a degree in economics.

09:53.627 --> 09:55.262
What do you want to do
when you grow up?

09:55.295 --> 09:56.563
SCARLET:
I'd like to help restructure

09:56.596 --> 09:58.065
the economies
in new democracies.

09:58.098 --> 10:00.200
WOMAN: What about just being
a little girl?

10:00.233 --> 10:02.169
Yeah, I like to play
and be with my friends,

10:02.202 --> 10:04.037
but also I want
to start my career.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.339
So if you were to get married
and have a partner,

10:06.373 --> 10:08.441
would you support them
financially?

10:08.475 --> 10:10.610
Absolutely not.
I have no desire

10:10.644 --> 10:14.715
to support anyone who cannot
support themselves financially.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.750
Can we watch RuPaul Drag Race?
How about being

10:16.784 --> 10:18.551
the president
of the United States?
Yes, please.

10:18.585 --> 10:21.121
Maybe.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.122
Yeah, for a second...
RICH: Oh! There's your mom!

10:22.155 --> 10:24.291
Oh! Did...

10:24.324 --> 10:26.559
Gentlemen, start your engines.
FRANKIE: What?
That's not the channel it's on.

10:26.593 --> 10:30.030
And may the best woman win.
Well... okay.

10:30.063 --> 10:32.265
Mom, do you want me to go back
so you can watch your thing?

10:32.299 --> 10:33.934
No. It's fine.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.569
Just... Geez!

10:36.603 --> 10:37.771
Mom, what do you want?

10:37.805 --> 10:39.139
I don't know-- it just sucks

10:39.172 --> 10:40.473
that you didn't go back.

10:40.507 --> 10:42.943
Mom, don't
do that.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.644
It's not fair.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.114
Okay, I don't care. Forget it.

10:48.515 --> 10:50.450
They'll love you
when you're dead.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.319
That's right,
when you're dead they'll watch

10:52.352 --> 10:54.254
all of your stuff,
and they'll be amazed

10:54.287 --> 10:56.957
at what you've done.
They'll say beautiful
things at your funeral

10:56.990 --> 10:59.626
about how they were always
inspired by your career.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.161
No.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.097
No. I want it now.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.733
I want it now.

11:05.766 --> 11:08.101
I don't want to have to wait
till I'm dead

11:08.135 --> 11:10.603
for my kids to appreciate me.

11:14.842 --> 11:17.644
I'm numb from the waist down,
tuck included.

11:17.677 --> 11:20.113
I really could die, bitch;
I'm giving you realness.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.149
WOMAN: He's got
a smaller waist than Barbie.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.151
WOMAN 2:
Oh, don't sneeze, honey.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.253
You know...

11:26.286 --> 11:28.756
I think I have a right
to say this.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.490
(scoffs)
Frankie!

11:30.523 --> 11:31.491
What?

11:31.524 --> 11:32.525
Look...

11:32.559 --> 11:34.127
I do a special thing.

11:34.161 --> 11:37.330
I think I'm allowed
to say this at this point.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.599
Your mom is an actor,

11:39.632 --> 11:41.168
and I make things,

11:41.201 --> 11:43.436
and I put myself out there,

11:43.470 --> 11:46.506
and... I've accomplished
some things.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.510
And I've been doing it,
like, my whole life.

11:50.543 --> 11:53.146
Besides the fact that it pays
for all your clothes,

11:53.180 --> 11:56.083
it really sucks
that you don't give a shit.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.886
(chuckles):
Mom, you're being dramatic.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.320
Screw you, Max.

12:00.353 --> 12:02.322
Do you know how many
of your dance recitals

12:02.355 --> 12:03.991
I've been to,
and your games?

12:04.024 --> 12:05.392
And your games, Frankie?

12:05.425 --> 12:06.827
And I shower

12:06.860 --> 12:09.662
you guys with praise--
when you try.

12:09.696 --> 12:12.365
Why do I get none of that
in return?

12:12.399 --> 12:14.001
'Cause you're the adult, Sam.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.502
We're the children.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.838
And it is my job
to be proud of you.

12:17.871 --> 12:21.274
But it also,
it really hurts my feelings

12:21.308 --> 12:25.512
that my work
means nothing to you.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.647
Mom, yes, we're proud of you.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.083
And yeah, we'll say it
at your funeral.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.518
Well, I want to hear it now.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.256
That's me. I'm dead.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.525
This is my funeral.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.928
Oh, God,
cut it out, Mom.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.095
No.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.031
I died,

12:44.064 --> 12:45.132
Frankie.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.733
This is my funeral.

12:46.766 --> 12:47.901
Let's hear

12:47.935 --> 12:49.202
what you're gonna say.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.238
Mom, Mom, no...

12:51.271 --> 12:52.840
Oh, no, no, Dukey.

12:52.873 --> 12:53.974
No, baby,

12:54.007 --> 12:55.408
you're dead, too.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.410
We both died. We're dead.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.578
Look.

12:58.611 --> 13:00.914
See? Look.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.582
Look. This is you.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.551
You're laying
right here next to Mommy.

13:04.584 --> 13:07.587
How did we die?
Um... well,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.222
we got in a car accident,

13:09.256 --> 13:10.858
because... we were...

13:10.891 --> 13:13.060
picking up... you, Frankie.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.896
And you weren't there.
You went to Sanaam's house

13:15.929 --> 13:19.166
without telling me, and
we had to go way up the canyon,

13:19.199 --> 13:21.068
and we rolled the car.

13:21.101 --> 13:22.769
Big ball of fire.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.304
We're both dead.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.705
This is our funeral.

13:25.738 --> 13:27.074
Thanks.

13:27.107 --> 13:28.241
Go.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.943
Eulogize me.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.378
Mom, you're, like,

13:31.411 --> 13:33.013
traumatizing us right now.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.948
Yeah, that's the point.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.985
Let's hear any feelings
about me at all.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.258
Okay.

13:45.292 --> 13:48.161
It's your funeral.
(sighs)

13:49.429 --> 13:51.198
Here lies Sam.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.969
Ha-ha! Loser!

13:56.003 --> 13:57.370
MAX:
Stop it!

13:57.404 --> 13:59.339
It's not funny!
Yes, it is.

14:00.173 --> 14:02.709
This is a joke.

14:02.742 --> 14:04.644
(loud footsteps
going up stairs)

14:06.679 --> 14:07.981
(door slams)

14:11.684 --> 14:13.253
Do you see what she does?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.355
She is such a drama queen.
She acts like a child.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.257
She's always the victim.

14:18.825 --> 14:21.828
Oh, me? Don't look to me
to back you up, girls.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.497
TRESSA:
You chased your mother

14:24.531 --> 14:26.399
out of her own house.

14:26.433 --> 14:28.668
That was stunning.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.503
Yup.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.472
O-Oh, my God. We didn't.

14:32.505 --> 14:35.142
No, she completely
started it.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.477
Unless you want to hear
what I have to say,

14:37.510 --> 14:39.079
don't engage me.

14:54.227 --> 14:56.296
You're dead.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.735
* Oh, no

15:02.769 --> 15:05.105
* There goes

15:05.138 --> 15:07.307
* There goes my head

15:07.340 --> 15:09.676
* There goes my

15:09.709 --> 15:11.244
* Head...

15:13.346 --> 15:15.582
We'd sneak into the
little boys' room

15:15.615 --> 15:17.384
and mess around.
(laughs)

15:17.417 --> 15:19.019
Really?
Yeah!

15:19.052 --> 15:20.988
But only
small stuff.

15:21.021 --> 15:23.723
One boy would lick his finger...

15:23.756 --> 15:27.027
and then he'd stick it
up the other boy's keister.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.196
(chuckles)
That's as far as it went.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.730
No blowing or anything?

15:30.763 --> 15:33.933
Oh, no, no, no.
It was a Catholic school.

15:33.967 --> 15:38.071
Aw, that's tough, Ray.
Mmm.

15:38.105 --> 15:40.340
Nobody could be openly gay

15:40.373 --> 15:43.576
until I was too old
to have any fun.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.647
I feel like the
exact same thing

15:47.680 --> 15:50.117
is happening to me.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.086
(phone buzzes)

15:53.120 --> 15:55.588
SAM:
Oh.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.424
I got to go.
Uh-uh, no.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.891
I got this, babe.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.160
Really?

16:02.029 --> 16:03.997
Okay.

16:04.031 --> 16:06.099
You have a good night.
Good to see you.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.634
Drive carefully.
Thanks for the drink.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.269
There's a lot of
nuts out there.
I will.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.570
All right, honey bun.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.738
SAM:
Bye, Patrick.

16:11.771 --> 16:14.307
See ya when I see ya, Sam.

16:16.709 --> 16:20.913
* In the stories,
the lies that they wrote *

16:20.947 --> 16:22.582
* Escape me

16:22.615 --> 16:24.617
*

16:24.651 --> 16:26.619
* And the winged horses

16:26.653 --> 16:28.321
* That we once rode

16:28.355 --> 16:31.424
* Have stopped breathing.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.460
*

16:36.729 --> 16:38.765
Hello?

16:38.798 --> 16:40.333
(murmur nearby)

16:40.367 --> 16:43.070
Hello?

16:45.972 --> 16:47.540
Oh.

16:47.574 --> 16:51.344
Shh.

16:51.378 --> 16:54.181
* I saw God

16:54.214 --> 16:58.351
* By the river

16:58.385 --> 17:02.589
* Panning for gold

17:02.622 --> 17:04.424
* I saw God

17:04.457 --> 17:07.794
* By the river

17:07.827 --> 17:11.698
* Weary and old

17:11.731 --> 17:14.033
* He said, Son

17:14.067 --> 17:16.969
* I used to know

17:17.003 --> 17:18.705
* Where I put things

17:18.738 --> 17:22.709
* I used to know...

17:27.046 --> 17:30.016
Here lie Sam and Duke.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.719
Gone so suddenly.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.154
In attendance,

17:34.187 --> 17:37.990
her surviving daughters,
Frankie and Max,

17:38.024 --> 17:41.361
and her friends,
Tressa and Rich,

17:41.394 --> 17:43.363
who are now in custody
of her children

17:43.396 --> 17:45.198
because she left no word
of how to provide

17:45.232 --> 17:47.367
for her children
in case of her death.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.536
Oh, shit. I got
to take care of that.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.171
Shh. We're dead.

17:51.204 --> 17:52.672
Sorry.

17:52.705 --> 17:55.642
Sam's friend Tressa
would like to say something.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.110
* I saw God

17:57.144 --> 18:00.147
* In the forest

18:00.180 --> 18:01.214
(sniffs)

18:01.248 --> 18:04.417
* Teaching Tai Chi

18:04.451 --> 18:07.187
* To the trees...

18:07.220 --> 18:10.823
Sam was my best friend.

18:10.857 --> 18:13.260
Even if I wasn't hers,
which is fine.

18:13.293 --> 18:14.661
Hee.

18:14.694 --> 18:17.397
Quiet are the dead.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.998
Oops.

18:19.031 --> 18:23.170
She is the best mother
I ever saw.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.405
Better than my mother.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.140
Better than me.

18:27.174 --> 18:30.310
I could never be like her.

18:30.343 --> 18:33.780
Which is always a comfort.

18:33.813 --> 18:36.949
She's like my pace car.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.885
I love you, Sam.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.420
I'll miss you.

18:40.453 --> 18:43.956
Aw. Sorry.

18:46.959 --> 18:50.062
My mom was really cool
and talented,

18:50.096 --> 18:53.366
and I really admired
the way she worked so hard.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.834
And even though she had
to take care of us,

18:54.867 --> 18:56.869
she did amazing things.

18:56.903 --> 18:59.906
And I always watched every show
she ever did,

18:59.939 --> 19:01.574
but I never told her.

19:01.608 --> 19:05.312
And I was always proud of her,
but I never told her,

19:05.345 --> 19:07.447
because...

19:07.480 --> 19:10.950
I think that once
I gave her that...

19:10.983 --> 19:13.786
I wouldn't have it
to give anymore.

19:13.820 --> 19:16.656
And now I wish I hadn't waited.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.491
My mom was my rock.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.928
Every day of my life
I wake up and I feel bad.

19:21.961 --> 19:23.796
I feel like I'm not going
to get through this day

19:23.830 --> 19:26.599
just with all the stuff
that's in my own head.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.901
And as soon as I see--

19:28.935 --> 19:31.571
would see her in the morning,

19:31.604 --> 19:34.407
I would unload on her:
"Mom, where are my socks?"

19:34.441 --> 19:36.776
Or whatever, because...

19:36.809 --> 19:39.446
I needed to give her
some of my pain

19:39.479 --> 19:42.649
because I knew she could
carry it when I couldn't.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.817
And now that she's gone,

19:44.851 --> 19:48.020
I don't know what
I'm going to do.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.324
I never watched my mom's shows.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.126
Ever.

19:54.160 --> 19:57.530
I never saw any of her work.

19:57.564 --> 20:01.468
And I don't really care about
what she did because she's Mom.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.103
(sniffles)

20:04.136 --> 20:08.375
And I was jealous that people
knew her before I did.

20:08.408 --> 20:11.978
And I never wanted to share her.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.381
Not even with my sisters,

20:14.414 --> 20:17.183
because I remember
when it was just me and her.

20:17.216 --> 20:21.220
Even when my dad was there,
it was just me and her.

20:21.254 --> 20:24.857
And I know that was hard for her
but I loved it.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.627
(crying and sniffling)

20:27.660 --> 20:30.997
So I don't like that she's
famous or on TV.

20:31.030 --> 20:33.500
She's my mother.

20:33.533 --> 20:36.903
I learned from her
how to be a woman

20:36.936 --> 20:39.506
and how to be a person.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.742
And all I can say now
that she's gone is...

20:42.775 --> 20:44.777
(crying)

20:49.516 --> 20:51.083
RICH:
Sam.

20:51.117 --> 20:53.820
(crying and sniffling continues)

20:53.853 --> 20:57.724
Sam was a...

20:57.757 --> 21:00.026
unhinged...

21:00.059 --> 21:03.029
complicated woman.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.998
She was very short.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.267
I never told her that,

21:08.301 --> 21:11.270
but I think we can all now say
she-she was short.

21:11.304 --> 21:13.340
Yes, she was very short.

21:13.373 --> 21:15.074
(crying and laughing)

21:15.107 --> 21:17.510
She lied a lot.

21:17.544 --> 21:20.380
A lot.

21:20.413 --> 21:23.049
She was two years older
than she ever told anyone.

21:23.082 --> 21:26.085
She was the rudest,

21:26.118 --> 21:29.088
most inappropriate woman

21:29.121 --> 21:30.823
I've ever met.

21:36.128 --> 21:39.466
(sobbing):
Thank you, guys, so much.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.768
I love you so much.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.102
FRANKIE:
I love you, Mom.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.571
MAX:
Mom, I love you.

21:44.604 --> 21:45.972
TRESSA: We love you.
RICH: Yeah.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.641
(crying):
Nobody said anything about me.

21:48.675 --> 21:51.811
I'm lying here dead
and nobody cares.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.312
(chuckling):
Oh, Dukey. Oh, Dukey.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.747
Sweetie.

21:54.781 --> 21:56.449
(overlapping chatter)

21:56.483 --> 21:59.251
(Duke crying)

21:59.285 --> 22:01.754
SAM (crying):
No. No, you're not...

22:01.788 --> 22:03.956
You're not dead. No.

22:03.990 --> 22:05.057
SAM: Tu-tu-tuy.
RICH: Tu-tu-tuy.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.926
Tu-tu-tu...
Tu-tuy.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.227
I love you.

22:08.260 --> 22:09.429
Thank you.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.997
I love you.

22:11.030 --> 22:12.164
Thank you so much.

22:12.198 --> 22:13.833
I love you.

22:13.866 --> 22:16.836
Sacrifice!

22:16.869 --> 22:18.938
Sacrifice!

22:18.971 --> 22:20.740
Rosemary's Baby.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.875
Sacrifice.

22:22.909 --> 22:27.213
ALL (chanting):
Sacrifice. Sacrifice.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.583
(whooping)

22:30.617 --> 22:34.421
* Oh, I, I

22:34.454 --> 22:38.024
* Will break you in

22:38.057 --> 22:40.893
Death is in, death is in.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.895
(all laughing)

22:42.929 --> 22:44.931
(whooping)

22:44.964 --> 22:46.466
Death is in, man.

22:46.499 --> 22:47.867
Oh, yeah.

22:47.900 --> 22:50.302
FRANKIE:
How does it feel?

22:50.336 --> 22:53.139
MAX:
See you on the other side.

22:53.172 --> 22:56.075
* I, I

22:56.108 --> 23:00.447
* Will lend you my skin

23:00.480 --> 23:03.816
* I'd lend you my skin

23:03.850 --> 23:06.318
* Ooh-ooh, ooh

23:06.352 --> 23:08.087
* Heard you were rolling in

23:08.120 --> 23:10.890
* The good times out west

23:10.923 --> 23:12.525
* Went to the desert

23:12.559 --> 23:16.062
* To find your destiny
and place *

23:16.095 --> 23:18.397
* Did they set you straight

23:18.431 --> 23:21.200
* In your life crisis?

23:26.873 --> 23:28.841
* Did you see me
floating there *

23:28.875 --> 23:30.577
* Above your body

23:30.610 --> 23:32.545
* Like an angel suspended

23:32.579 --> 23:34.180
* Or an enemy

23:34.213 --> 23:37.550
* You failed to recognize?
