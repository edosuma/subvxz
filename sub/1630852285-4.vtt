00:09.409 --> 00:12.811
One of the more interesting
chairs in history for me

00:12.813 --> 00:14.212
Is the dining couch.

00:14.214 --> 00:17.215
The romans called them
lectus triclinaris

00:17.217 --> 00:19.151
And used them
for dinner parties.

00:19.153 --> 00:21.886
I suppose 'cause if they
drank too much, they could --

00:21.888 --> 00:23.688
Stop! Don't eat that.
It's an onion.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.558
You're an onion.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.960
Oh!

00:27.962 --> 00:30.895
Oh. Why do you have
an onion in the fruit bowl?

00:30.897 --> 00:32.297
It's a long story.
I was in --

00:32.299 --> 00:35.033
Not tonight.
I've heard enough tonight.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.003
Why does everyone
have to share so much?

00:39.906 --> 00:41.774
As soon as this water boils,

00:41.776 --> 00:44.042
I'm gonna share
these pierogies with you.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.377
Thank you, thank you.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.180
That's not what I meant.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.114
It was like everyone was,
like --

00:50.116 --> 00:52.985
It was like a tell all,
you know, like,

00:52.987 --> 00:55.253
Too open, you know?

00:55.255 --> 00:57.589
No. But I want to.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.992
Just a sec.

00:59.994 --> 01:03.195
Sarah just got back
from diane ludden's house.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.530
Sue melsky
saw her at the store

01:05.532 --> 01:08.334
And invited her
to wine Wednesday.

01:10.537 --> 01:11.736
Are they in the pot?

01:11.738 --> 01:14.139
Yeah.
Well, we got 10 minutes.

01:14.141 --> 01:17.409
Will you tell me
what happened tonight?

01:17.411 --> 01:19.478
Yes.

No rush.

01:34.161 --> 01:36.428
Well,
you know the beginning,

01:36.430 --> 01:38.430
'cause I called you, right?

01:38.432 --> 01:39.832
Right.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.966
Sounds like you're
alone in your truck

01:41.968 --> 01:44.169
As opposed to inside,
surrounded by women.

01:44.171 --> 01:47.439
It was nice to be asked,
but I don't know them.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.241
You should go in.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.844
Remember when
you had clarity in the woods

01:51.846 --> 01:54.513
And determined
to do you good?

01:54.515 --> 01:55.848

the living room

03:13.260 --> 03:16.661
And they had a huge spread --
wine and stuff,

03:16.663 --> 03:19.264
And it smelled like
100 vanilla candles.

Sue,
this chicken is great.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.867
How did you get it
so thin?

03:22.869 --> 03:24.336
I put the cutlets
in plastic baggies

03:24.338 --> 03:25.938
And backed over them
with the car.

03:25.940 --> 03:28.206
Shut the hell up, bitch.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.943
So, sarah,
how do you know sue?
