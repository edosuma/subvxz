00:08.301 --> 00:11.770
I am gonna keep you here,
right here for the rest

00:11.804 --> 00:13.238
of your mediocre career.

00:13.272 --> 00:15.207
I've decided to spread my wings, and, um,

00:15.241 --> 00:16.942
stay at Galweather.

00:16.976 --> 00:18.343
JEANNIE: <i> </i> M <i>arty...</i>

00:18.378 --> 00:19.945
(sighs) I love you.

00:19.979 --> 00:21.380
Jesus, Jeannie.

00:21.414 --> 00:22.614
"Jesus, Jeannie"?

00:22.648 --> 00:23.615
Do you remember how fun it was?

00:23.649 --> 00:24.883
Clyde and me goofing around?

00:24.917 --> 00:26.118
Marty always telling me to, you know,

00:26.152 --> 00:27.419
"Shut the fuck up, Doug." Shut
the fuck up, Doug.

00:27.453 --> 00:28.420
Exactly.

00:28.454 --> 00:29.721
Nah, I met someone kind of cool.

00:29.756 --> 00:31.123
On the team? Yeah.

00:31.157 --> 00:32.824
MARTY: <i> </i> L <i>ex-- boy or girl?</i>

00:32.859 --> 00:34.393
Lex was born a girl.

00:34.427 --> 00:36.395
The work we're doing for
the Defense Department?

00:36.429 --> 00:37.529
Why are you whispering?

00:37.563 --> 00:38.730
Because I think we've crossed

00:38.765 --> 00:40.632
some legal and ethical boundaries.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.167
My college roommate is
with <i> The New York Times.</i>

00:42.201 --> 00:44.269
If you tell her even half

00:44.303 --> 00:46.505
of what you told me...

00:46.539 --> 00:48.173
This could take down Galweather Stearn.

00:48.207 --> 00:49.841
JEANNIE: <i>I want what you have.</i>

00:49.876 --> 00:51.109
<i>I want parity.</i>

00:51.144 --> 00:53.845
While our interests coincide at the moment,

00:53.880 --> 00:55.847
I will not hesitate to
throw you under the bus

00:55.882 --> 00:57.282
if it serves me in the future.

01:01.421 --> 01:03.755
JEREMIAH: <i>It's been a long road.</i>

01:03.790 --> 01:05.557
<i>A little bumpy, sure,</i>

01:05.591 --> 01:06.792
<i>but here you are.</i>

01:06.826 --> 01:09.561
Got your own shop up and running.

01:09.595 --> 01:12.097
Your right-hand gal by your side again.

01:12.131 --> 01:13.865
Everything you wanted.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.401
Yeah, it's just a matter of
how I fuck it up now, right?

01:16.436 --> 01:18.837
Oh, I'm not that much of a scold.

01:18.871 --> 01:20.806
Am I? Don't you answer that.

01:24.043 --> 01:27.145
You just need to let your
defenses down and smile.

01:27.180 --> 01:29.681
'Cause these moments are rare, Marty.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.249
I'm happy for you.

01:31.284 --> 01:32.217
Thanks, Pop.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.020
(sighs)

01:35.054 --> 01:36.188
Tiny little bird

01:36.222 --> 01:40.192
flying back home to the nest.

01:40.226 --> 01:42.494
Jeannie.

01:42.528 --> 01:44.029
(high-pitched voice): Jeannie,
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie...

01:44.063 --> 01:45.097
Jeannie...

01:45.131 --> 01:47.365
You know, Galweather's the nest.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.668
She's actually leaving the nest.

01:49.702 --> 01:51.136
So your metaphor's for shit.

01:51.170 --> 01:52.137
(laughing): Okay.

01:52.171 --> 01:54.473
Oh, no, no, no.

01:54.507 --> 01:56.608
Come on, Dad, you chose to wear this today?

01:56.642 --> 01:59.511
What are...? Look. It's not a big deal.

01:59.545 --> 02:01.513
People start new jobs all the time.

02:01.547 --> 02:02.747
Dad, what are you talking about?

02:02.782 --> 02:04.382
You said you had a meeting
with DollaHyde today.

02:04.417 --> 02:06.651
Yeah, and you didn't forget, did you?

02:06.686 --> 02:08.687
You promised you'd score me some swag.

02:08.721 --> 02:11.423
Grandpa, DollaHyde has the sickest clothes.

02:11.457 --> 02:13.458
Well, score me some of that swag as well.

02:13.493 --> 02:15.026
Oh, yeah, that'll be a good look.

02:15.061 --> 02:16.228
Dad, if you want DollaHyde

02:16.262 --> 02:17.429
to buy in, I was thinking,

02:17.463 --> 02:19.064
you know, you need more flair.

02:19.098 --> 02:20.432
Maybe a fedora?

02:20.466 --> 02:22.334
Fe... ? Yeah, I'm not wearing
a fedora. Fedora.

02:22.368 --> 02:24.669
You know who I bet would
like to see you in a fedora?

02:24.704 --> 02:25.704
Jeannie.

02:25.738 --> 02:27.405
It's Jeannie's first day today.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.874
Oh! Jeannie.

02:28.908 --> 02:29.941
No, no, no, no, no. Roscoe...

02:29.976 --> 02:31.076
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie.

02:31.110 --> 02:32.277

02:32.311 --> 02:33.678
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie.

02:33.713 --> 02:35.313
It's like preschool in here with you two.

02:35.348 --> 02:37.149
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie.

02:37.183 --> 02:38.583
Have a great day at the office, son.

02:38.618 --> 02:40.485

02:40.520 --> 02:43.522

02:59.305 --> 03:01.506
Hey. Morning. Good morning.

03:02.909 --> 03:04.943
Uh, yeah, let me give you the tour.

03:04.977 --> 03:06.945
Actually, I want to get
up to speed on DollaHyde.

03:06.979 --> 03:08.780
Would you mind pointing me in
the direction of my office?

03:08.814 --> 03:10.115
Yeah.

03:10.149 --> 03:11.116
Sur... Yeah, it's this way.

03:13.719 --> 03:15.520
So, uh, I read an interesting article

03:15.555 --> 03:17.923
this morning in the newspaper
concerning Galweather Stearn.

03:17.957 --> 03:19.157
Front page.

03:19.192 --> 03:20.792
Front page of the newspaper? Mm-hmm.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.761
Tell me more, Grandpa. (laughs)

03:22.795 --> 03:24.930
Apparently a woman named Benita Spire

03:24.964 --> 03:27.299
leaked all this black budget DoD shit.

03:27.333 --> 03:29.067
Benita? I think she was in my pod.

03:29.135 --> 03:30.335
Really!

03:30.369 --> 03:32.604
I hope this doesn't come
back to hurt the Rainmaker.

03:32.638 --> 03:35.941
Gosh, guy just can't catch a break.

03:35.975 --> 03:37.943
Here we are.

03:41.948 --> 03:43.415
Pretty bitching, huh?

03:43.449 --> 03:45.483
Check out those views.

03:45.518 --> 03:47.986
Oh, uh, apparently,

03:48.020 --> 03:49.287
these are called "accent pillows."

03:49.322 --> 03:51.823
Cost more than my fucking loft.

03:51.857 --> 03:54.192
Oh, and that's that back-support
chair that you were trying to...

03:54.227 --> 03:55.560
(chair legs screeching over floor)

03:55.595 --> 03:57.796
Trying to convince them
to buy you at Galweather.

03:57.830 --> 03:58.964
It's nice.

03:58.998 --> 04:01.566
Uh, what's the wireless password?

04:01.601 --> 04:03.935
The wireless password.

04:03.970 --> 04:06.171
The wireless password is
"the wireless password"?

04:06.205 --> 04:08.506
(wry chuckle)

04:08.541 --> 04:10.609
I-I'll-I'll have someone get it for you.

04:10.643 --> 04:12.577
Great. Thanks.

The operations manager is the brains, right?

04:30.763 --> 04:32.430
And Marty can see that, but he also sees

04:32.465 --> 04:35.200
the CEO is not really
taking this guy seriously.

04:35.234 --> 04:36.968
Means he's kind of this crass type.

04:37.003 --> 04:39.137
It's a classic <i>Cherry Orchard </i> scenario.

04:39.171 --> 04:41.539
That's a-a term that I originated.

04:41.574 --> 04:43.275
You see,<i> The Cherry Orchard</i>
is a play by Anton...

04:43.309 --> 04:44.276
Chekhov, yeah.

04:44.310 --> 04:45.744
The CEO is Lyubov

04:45.778 --> 04:48.013
and the operations manager is Lopakhin.

04:48.047 --> 04:51.516
Yeah. Yeah.

04:51.550 --> 04:52.884
So, what did Marty do?

04:52.918 --> 04:54.853
What? Well, he got us the business obviously.

04:54.887 --> 04:57.656
Very cool. Yeah! Very cool.

04:57.690 --> 04:59.424
Right.

04:59.458 --> 05:00.558
She has a boyfriend.

05:00.593 --> 05:01.559
Oh, that's fine.

05:01.594 --> 05:02.594
Apparently you have a wife?

05:02.628 --> 05:03.762
Yeah, no, I wasn't, uh...

05:03.829 --> 05:04.796
No worries.

05:04.830 --> 05:05.997
Put her in the spank bank.

05:06.032 --> 05:07.432
Deposits are free.

05:07.466 --> 05:09.234
That's fine; I get it. Doug?

05:09.268 --> 05:11.102
Wha...? Hey, speak of the devil.

05:11.137 --> 05:13.038
I was just, uh, regaling the newbies

05:13.072 --> 05:15.707
with some, uh, classic tales
of Marty Kaan derring-do.

05:15.741 --> 05:16.775
What are you doing here?

05:16.809 --> 05:18.276
Literally just told you.

05:18.311 --> 05:19.678
I was regaling the newbies... No, no, no.

05:19.712 --> 05:22.314
What... what are you doing <i> here?</i>

05:22.348 --> 05:24.082
In my kitchen at my company.

05:24.116 --> 05:25.283

05:25.318 --> 05:26.284
What do you mean?

05:26.319 --> 05:28.019
Jeannie spoke to you, right?

05:28.054 --> 05:29.521
About...?

05:29.555 --> 05:30.955
Well, that when she came over,

05:30.990 --> 05:32.390
the thought was that I would obviously...

05:32.425 --> 05:34.626
Oh, oh, oh, God. I'm sorry.

05:34.660 --> 05:36.695
There's-there's-there's been some confusion.

05:36.729 --> 05:39.130
Okay, well, now that we've sorted it out.

05:39.165 --> 05:40.532
We can just work through it... Doug...

05:40.566 --> 05:41.599
I'll just hit my office...
You made a decision

05:41.634 --> 05:43.368
to stay at Galweather; I respect that.

05:43.402 --> 05:44.669
Uh, that was stupid.

05:44.704 --> 05:47.939
(laughs) No, don't-don't respect me.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.841
Honestly, I'm so stupid.

05:49.875 --> 05:51.376
Uh-uh-uh, have you read the papers?

05:51.410 --> 05:52.711
Federal investigation, Marty.

05:52.745 --> 05:54.112
There won't even be a
Galweather in six months.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.547
It's not personal.

05:55.581 --> 05:56.948
We just don't have any
space for you right now.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.416
Make space. Fire someone.

05:58.484 --> 05:59.584
Doug... What about him?

05:59.618 --> 06:01.786
Yes, fire him! Hey!
What are you talking about?

06:01.821 --> 06:03.988
No. Come on, look at him, he's perfect.

06:04.023 --> 06:05.423
It's guys like that that used
to beat guys like us up.

06:05.458 --> 06:06.391
Doug!

06:06.425 --> 06:07.926
I'm sorry.

06:07.960 --> 06:09.361
Look, it was great to see you, okay?

06:09.395 --> 06:10.862
Say hi to Sarah for me.

06:10.896 --> 06:12.197
Yeah, I will.

06:12.231 --> 06:13.898
It was good to see you, too.

06:18.938 --> 06:19.904
How dare you.

06:19.939 --> 06:21.239
Yeah, you.

06:21.273 --> 06:22.607
I just spoke to Marty.

06:22.641 --> 06:24.542
How could you not stand by me?

06:24.577 --> 06:26.845
I've always stuck by you! Always!

06:26.879 --> 06:28.780
In spite of your myriad flaws.

06:28.814 --> 06:30.415
Yeah, that second-tier intellect

06:30.449 --> 06:32.617
that you try to cover up by flashing

06:32.651 --> 06:33.785
your pearly white veneers

06:33.819 --> 06:35.120
and giving them a little of that

06:35.154 --> 06:36.855
working class moxie. Give me a break.

06:36.889 --> 06:37.956
Oh, and don't even get me started

06:37.990 --> 06:39.791
on your questionable sexual morals.

06:39.825 --> 06:41.960
Are you done? No, I am not!

06:41.994 --> 06:43.728
He's fucking with you, Doug.

06:48.467 --> 06:49.834

06:49.869 --> 06:51.102
And I don't have veneers.

06:51.137 --> 06:52.103
No, of course not.

06:52.138 --> 06:53.638
That's... No, you have a great set

06:53.672 --> 06:54.939

That's what I'm saying.

06:54.974 --> 06:56.040

Seriously, Doug, I don't have veneers.

Real, not real, who cares? They're lovely.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.345
Hey, we got to get going.

07:00.379 --> 07:01.946
Yeah. Okay, I reviewed DollaHyde.

07:01.981 --> 07:03.014
It seems straightforward, right?

07:03.048 --> 07:04.048
Doug, can you excuse us, please?

07:04.083 --> 07:05.917
This is proprietary information.

07:05.951 --> 07:08.520
We cannot have Galweather
poaching our business.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.255
Right, right, right,
'cause I still work at Galweather.

07:10.289 --> 07:11.723
I love it. Get out.

07:11.757 --> 07:14.526
So, listen, this DollaHyde thing

07:14.560 --> 07:15.994
is pretty by the numbers.

07:16.028 --> 07:18.196
Our guys are looking to trade
their hard-earned credibility

07:18.230 --> 07:19.831
for a big old payday.

07:19.865 --> 07:21.533
Mmm. Little wrinkle here:

07:21.567 --> 07:22.967
they started on a street corner.

07:23.002 --> 07:26.304
Drug dealers? Yeah,
small-time, by all accounts,

07:26.338 --> 07:28.173
but, you know, they had some
pretty hardcore friends.

07:28.207 --> 07:29.474
So DollaHyde's seed money...

07:29.508 --> 07:31.509
Did not come from a venture capital firm.

07:31.544 --> 07:33.077
And I've gotten so used to consulting

07:33.112 --> 07:35.213
for white-collar criminals.

07:35.247 --> 07:37.549
Hey, Doug, you want us to, uh,
drop you off at Galweather?

07:37.583 --> 07:39.250
We're gonna be shooting right by there.

Zing. You are <i> en fuego,</i> sir. Come on.

Uh, hey, Jeannie,
have you spoken to him or not?

07:44.623 --> 07:47.759
Because I can't tell. Marty,
please tell Doug you're fucking with him.

07:47.793 --> 07:49.761
Doug, I am fucking with you.

07:51.497 --> 07:53.765
Okay. So is now the time
to talk about terms or...

07:53.799 --> 07:56.601
Doug. (clears throat)
I'm sure you'll be fair.

07:56.635 --> 07:58.670
So, listen, since you're playing catch-up,

08:08.214 --> 08:10.415
I had shit to do.

08:10.449 --> 08:12.717
Yeah, I can see that. Mmm.

08:12.751 --> 08:13.885
What's your problem, nigga?

08:13.919 --> 08:15.687
My problem,<i> nigga,</i>

08:15.721 --> 08:17.422
is the meeting was at 10:00.

08:17.456 --> 08:20.425
10:00, 12:00, 2:00.
What difference does it make?

08:20.459 --> 08:23.895
They need <i> us</i> to put a shitload
of paper in <i> they</i> pockets.

08:23.929 --> 08:26.531
Where the fuck they going?

08:26.565 --> 08:27.999
Okay.

08:28.033 --> 08:30.768
Vernon, Dre blood sugar actin' up on him.

08:30.803 --> 08:32.636
Give him your apple pie.

08:32.671 --> 08:35.039
(chuckles) I don't want no
motherfuckin' apple pie.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.777
Ruh-roh!

08:39.812 --> 08:43.047
Looks like they've lost
that... lovin' feeling.

08:49.054 --> 08:51.055
Wh... (sputters, coughs)

08:53.792 --> 08:56.961
When Dre Collins and Lukas
Frye started DollaHyde,

08:56.996 --> 08:59.030
they had nothing but a dream in their hearts

08:59.064 --> 09:00.832
and a little drug money in their pockets.

09:00.866 --> 09:02.233
God bless America.

09:02.268 --> 09:03.735
Dre was the business mind,

09:03.769 --> 09:05.770
and Lukas was the creative force,

09:05.804 --> 09:08.006
but they shared a common goal:

09:08.040 --> 09:09.874
getting huge.

09:09.909 --> 09:11.476
And they did it.

09:11.510 --> 09:13.278
Ten years later,

09:13.312 --> 09:15.146
here's Dre in his cashmere sweater

09:15.180 --> 09:16.648
and Givenchy shoes,

09:16.682 --> 09:18.082
with all the accessories

09:18.117 --> 09:20.485
this season's rags-to-riches
story is wearing.

09:20.519 --> 09:23.621
The fairy tale family...

09:23.656 --> 09:26.090
invitations galore to rub
elbows with the elite...

09:26.125 --> 09:27.625
Wait a minute!

09:27.660 --> 09:28.893
Who was that guy?

09:28.928 --> 09:30.562
He looks familiar.

09:30.596 --> 09:31.796
Where have I seen him before?

09:31.830 --> 09:33.398
(chuckles)

09:33.432 --> 09:34.365
But Lukas?

09:34.400 --> 09:35.366
Nah.

09:35.401 --> 09:37.068
That shit don't interest him.

09:37.102 --> 09:38.603
What interests him?

09:38.637 --> 09:41.172
What's always interested him.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.206
(sound of gun cocking)

09:42.241 --> 09:43.775
Gun.

09:43.809 --> 09:45.209
(sound of gunshots)

09:45.244 --> 09:46.477
Gun.

09:46.512 --> 09:47.712
(sound of siren wailing)

09:47.746 --> 09:48.713
Gun.

09:51.917 --> 09:52.884
Oh.

09:52.918 --> 09:54.719
Gun.

09:54.753 --> 09:55.753
(sound of automatic gunfire)

09:55.788 --> 09:57.288
And the latest in ankle monitor fashion--

09:57.323 --> 09:58.523
(monitor beeping)

09:58.557 --> 09:59.991
Bedazzling!

10:00.025 --> 10:02.193
Personally, I could give two shits

10:02.227 --> 10:03.795
if these two ever rediscover the love

10:03.829 --> 10:05.129
that made DollaHyde

10:05.164 --> 10:06.864
the envy of the hip hop fashion world.

10:06.899 --> 10:09.100
But I got a brand-new shop

10:09.134 --> 10:11.869
and 25 hungry MBA bellies to feed.

10:11.904 --> 10:13.605
And they're not getting fed

10:13.639 --> 10:16.774
unless these two link
arms and sing "Kumbaya."

10:16.809 --> 10:18.409
The question is

10:18.444 --> 10:20.745
how are we going to convince them to do that?

10:20.779 --> 10:21.746
Hmm.

10:21.780 --> 10:23.748
I wonder if they like money.

10:28.187 --> 10:30.355
Gentlemen, gentlemen.

10:30.389 --> 10:31.623
Marty Kaan.

10:31.657 --> 10:33.558
Dre Collins.

10:35.260 --> 10:36.260
I... I gotta...

10:38.864 --> 10:39.964
Mmm!

10:39.999 --> 10:41.265
That is some good shit.

10:41.300 --> 10:42.433
(snorts)

10:42.468 --> 10:43.534
(coughs)

10:43.569 --> 10:44.969
(slurps)

10:48.107 --> 10:49.407
Lukas. Lukas Frye.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.441
Nice to meet you.

10:50.476 --> 10:51.576
Sorry we kept you waiting.

10:51.610 --> 10:52.577
Aw, ain't a thing, ain't a thing.

10:52.611 --> 10:54.045
Right this way. All right.

10:54.079 --> 10:55.480
LUKAS: Hey, Ronnie,
get that apple pie off the floor.

10:55.514 --> 10:56.714
You heard Dre.

10:56.749 --> 10:57.882
We're running a professional
organization here.

10:57.916 --> 10:59.117
In a year's time,

10:59.151 --> 11:01.085
you will be extreme net worth individuals.

11:01.120 --> 11:02.587
LUKAS: Let me stop you there, playboy.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.489
You see, we are already

11:04.523 --> 11:06.624
extreme net worth individuals.

11:06.659 --> 11:08.493
JEANNIE: Ralph Lauren
has six billion dollars.

11:08.527 --> 11:10.428
Valentino, not nearly that much,

11:10.462 --> 11:12.230
maybe two billion.

11:12.264 --> 11:14.165
<i>They </i> are extreme net worth individuals.

11:14.199 --> 11:15.299
You guys are just rich.

11:15.334 --> 11:17.902
MARTY: An IPO is obviously

11:17.936 --> 11:19.370
the ultimate goal here. Right.

11:19.405 --> 11:21.272
But there are steps that we need
to take before we get there.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.874
LUKAS: You like, sweetheart?

11:22.908 --> 11:24.208
I had 'em about a month.

11:24.243 --> 11:25.710
They came out today, though.

11:25.744 --> 11:27.245
They're nice.

11:27.279 --> 11:28.980
LUKAS: They're a'ight. I got some really nice

11:29.014 --> 11:30.982
sneakers at the crib, though.

11:31.016 --> 11:32.083
Over 800 pair.

11:32.117 --> 11:33.985
You should really come check that shit out.

11:34.019 --> 11:36.487
DRE: What about licensing?

11:36.522 --> 11:38.656
We've had some internal discussions

11:38.691 --> 11:40.925
about collaborating

11:40.959 --> 11:42.393
with a big retailer. MARTY: Well, yes.

11:42.428 --> 11:44.062
That has proven to be a cash cow

11:44.096 --> 11:45.563
for a lot of fashion labels.

11:45.597 --> 11:46.664
Lagerfeld at H&M.

11:46.699 --> 11:47.999
Missoni at Target.

11:48.033 --> 11:49.033
LUKAS: Except Dre

11:49.068 --> 11:50.501
don't want us at Target.

11:50.536 --> 11:53.304
Nah, this bougie motherfucker
want to cut a ribbon

11:53.338 --> 11:54.639
at Barneys New York or something.

11:54.673 --> 11:56.607
But even Target's too
highbrow for you, right?

11:56.642 --> 11:57.909
Because you're

11:57.943 --> 11:59.277
a Walmart man. (laughs)

11:59.311 --> 12:00.978
LUKAS: Walmart did

12:01.013 --> 12:05.983
$135 billion in sales last fiscal year alone.

12:06.018 --> 12:07.852
Why would anybody want to
be in business with them?

12:07.886 --> 12:09.821
And besides, who the fuck we know

12:09.855 --> 12:11.823
from the hood that could go
shop at Barneys? "The hood."

12:11.857 --> 12:13.357
(laughing): Okay.

12:13.392 --> 12:14.759
If I could just add...

12:14.793 --> 12:16.360
Just let it play out. LUKAS: Me, myself,

12:16.395 --> 12:20.098
I don't have anything
personally against Barneys.

12:20.132 --> 12:21.265
They have a bangin' whitefish platter.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.600
Oh, that's true.

12:22.634 --> 12:25.203
And you catch a lot of
fine-ass girls shopping there.

12:25.237 --> 12:26.504
I bet you shop there, don't you, cupcake?

12:26.538 --> 12:27.472
Sometimes.

12:27.506 --> 12:29.340
Sometimes? Your man

12:29.374 --> 12:31.609
should buy that for you all the time.

12:31.643 --> 12:32.844
If you were mine,

12:32.878 --> 12:34.345
I'd dress you up like a
sexy little doll, baby.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.847
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

12:35.881 --> 12:36.681
(laughs)

12:37.583 --> 12:38.783
(laughs nervously)

12:38.817 --> 12:39.884
Don't mind her.

12:39.918 --> 12:41.018
She has a thing about black people.

12:41.053 --> 12:42.186
(laughs nervously) Right, that's true.

12:42.221 --> 12:43.721
She's not crazy about Asians, either.

12:43.756 --> 12:44.756
Don't help, Doug.

12:44.790 --> 12:45.723
LUKAS: Attitude.

12:45.758 --> 12:46.791
I like it.

12:46.825 --> 12:47.825
We will come at you

12:47.860 --> 12:48.860
with some hard numbers.

12:48.894 --> 12:49.994
You can have your philosophical

12:50.028 --> 12:51.896
fight then. In the meantime,

12:51.930 --> 12:54.932
what do you say we move on to other topics?

12:54.967 --> 12:56.367
Marty?

12:56.401 --> 12:57.468
The floor's all yours.

12:57.503 --> 12:58.469
Oh, you sure?

12:58.504 --> 13:00.004
Okay. Thank you, Jeannie.

13:00.038 --> 13:02.974
If you'll just look at the, uh, top sheet...

13:03.008 --> 13:05.209
DOUG: <i> I mean, he is all over</i> <i>Caitlin, right?</i>

13:05.244 --> 13:06.844
<i>The one I told you about. </i> A <i>nyway.</i>

13:06.879 --> 13:08.446
So then, out of nowhere,

13:08.480 --> 13:10.081
Jeannie literally tells the client

13:10.115 --> 13:11.616
to "shut the fuck up."

13:11.650 --> 13:13.117
Which is just as well, because, you know,

13:13.152 --> 13:15.453
I wathis close to jumping across the table

13:15.487 --> 13:16.988
and teaching him some manners myself.

13:17.022 --> 13:20.625
Oh, God, I wish you could've been there.

13:20.659 --> 13:22.693
Anyway, uh, call me when you can.

13:22.728 --> 13:24.729
Uh, I miss you, buddy.

13:29.168 --> 13:30.935
(line ringing)

13:30.969 --> 13:31.869
MAN: Hi.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.037
Everett, hi.

13:33.071 --> 13:34.238
Uh, it's Doug Guggenheim here.

13:34.273 --> 13:35.573
I'm trying to get a hold of Clyde.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.841
Yeah, you and half of Kinsley.

13:36.875 --> 13:38.376
He hasn't been to work in three days.

13:38.410 --> 13:39.544
DOUG: What, is he sick?

13:39.578 --> 13:40.845
Uh, taking vacation or something?

13:40.879 --> 13:42.647
No clue. He's totally AWOL.

13:42.681 --> 13:44.515
(sizzling)

13:44.550 --> 13:46.217
You have 26 new messages.

13:46.251 --> 13:48.152
(horn honks in distance)

13:48.187 --> 13:49.687
Hey!

13:49.721 --> 13:51.355
That's my fucking car!

13:51.390 --> 13:52.824
That's my fucking car, man!

13:52.858 --> 13:54.058
Get off my fucking car! (car horn honks)

13:54.092 --> 13:55.393
Fucking go, dude. Go.

13:55.427 --> 13:57.128
Get your fucking hands off my car right now.

13:57.162 --> 13:58.396
Get off of it. Dude, I'm sorry,

13:58.430 --> 13:59.931
but you didn't make your payments.

13:59.965 --> 14:01.465
All right, how about you get fucking cancer?

14:01.500 --> 14:02.633
How about that? How's that fucking feel?

14:02.668 --> 14:03.701
Dude, I'm just doing my job.

14:03.735 --> 14:04.735
You're just doing your job?

14:04.770 --> 14:05.870
You know who else was doing their job?

14:05.904 --> 14:07.038
Osama bin Laden, huh?

14:07.072 --> 14:08.139
Pol Pot!

14:08.173 --> 14:09.540
Fuckin' Jeffrey Dahmer is just

14:09.575 --> 14:10.608
doing his job!

14:10.642 --> 14:12.310
I fucking kill and eat teenage kids!

14:12.344 --> 14:13.911
Don't yell at me, though, man,

14:13.946 --> 14:14.979
I'm just doing my job! Hey!

14:15.013 --> 14:16.280
Asshole!

14:16.315 --> 14:18.482
Step the fuck back.

14:18.517 --> 14:19.617
Please don't take my car.

14:19.651 --> 14:20.918
You don't understand what this means to me.

14:20.953 --> 14:21.886
Look at me, man. You don't understand

14:21.920 --> 14:23.221
what this means to me.

14:23.255 --> 14:24.589
I always wanted a Porsche
and I finally got one.

14:24.623 --> 14:25.923
Okay? I got one, and it's mine

14:25.958 --> 14:27.258
and you're gonna take it
away from me right now!

14:27.292 --> 14:28.392
Just please, give it to me. (engine starts)

14:28.427 --> 14:29.393
Please!

14:29.428 --> 14:30.461
No. No, no, no, no.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.462
Don't drive away.

14:31.496 --> 14:32.463
Don't fucking drive away!

14:32.497 --> 14:35.633
Just let me get my fucking car!

14:35.667 --> 14:38.603
Huh?!

14:38.637 --> 14:39.637
Fuck you, then!

14:39.671 --> 14:40.972
Fuck you!

14:41.006 --> 14:43.007
Just keep fucking driving!

14:48.146 --> 14:49.113
Oh, hey, Jeannie?

14:49.147 --> 14:51.315
Can I talk to you for a sec?

14:51.350 --> 14:53.117
Yeah. What's up?

14:53.151 --> 14:54.952
I just wanted to thank you for this morning.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.087
With Lukas Frye.

14:56.121 --> 14:58.055
At a bar or a party,

14:58.090 --> 15:00.291
I'm pretty good at telling guys to...

15:00.325 --> 15:03.394
But, you know, with a client, I just...

15:03.428 --> 15:05.229
Anyway... thank you.

15:05.264 --> 15:06.330
You're welcome.

15:06.365 --> 15:08.099
There was a bit more going on there, but...

15:08.133 --> 15:09.500
I don't know if I...

15:09.534 --> 15:10.835
Well, Dre is clearly

15:10.869 --> 15:12.203
in the driver's seat at DollaHyde,

15:12.237 --> 15:14.338
so taking down Lukas

15:14.373 --> 15:16.374
is a way of earning the trust

15:16.408 --> 15:17.708
of the guy deciding our future.

15:17.743 --> 15:19.777
I totally didn't get that.

15:19.811 --> 15:21.112
That's with any company.

15:21.146 --> 15:22.647
Even one where there's an equal partnership,

15:22.681 --> 15:24.148
like Lukas and Dre,

15:24.182 --> 15:25.483
there's always an alpha.

15:25.517 --> 15:28.486
And it's all about keeping him happy.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.954
God...

15:29.988 --> 15:31.789
I hope I can be half as savvy

15:31.857 --> 15:33.824
in these situations one day.

15:33.859 --> 15:35.593
I'm sorry, that completely sounded

15:35.627 --> 15:36.861
like I was kissing your ass.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.063
Don't apologize.

15:39.097 --> 15:40.264
That's the move.

15:44.636 --> 15:45.770
Caitlin... Hmm? Yeah?

15:47.673 --> 15:49.407
Do you know what C.A.M. is?

15:49.441 --> 15:51.742
Capacity and Availability Marketing.

15:51.777 --> 15:53.210
Yeah, that's what you wrote

15:53.245 --> 15:54.979
in your deck for Frontier Electronics.

15:55.013 --> 15:58.215
It's actually Capacity and
Availability <i> Management.</i>

15:58.250 --> 16:00.818
We're promising to manage
the service capacity,

16:00.852 --> 16:01.986
not market it.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.821
Free piece of advice:

16:03.855 --> 16:05.923
rather than spending your lunch time

16:05.958 --> 16:06.924
reading Jane Austen...

16:06.959 --> 16:08.125
Oh, um...

16:08.160 --> 16:09.427
It's Thomas Hardy.

16:09.461 --> 16:12.496
(laughs) That doesn't matter.

16:12.531 --> 16:14.932
Maybe I'm lucky.

16:14.967 --> 16:18.002
I am not the read-for-pleasure type.

16:18.036 --> 16:19.370
But when I was you,

16:19.404 --> 16:21.772
I spent every waking moment

16:21.807 --> 16:23.774
poring over the shit I
didn't fully understand.

16:23.809 --> 16:25.509
When I was at work, when I was at home,

16:25.544 --> 16:26.877
in the car, in the shower.

16:26.912 --> 16:28.379
I mean, more than a few times,

16:28.413 --> 16:30.614
my then-boyfriend would be going down on me,

16:30.649 --> 16:32.950
and I would be checking out

16:32.985 --> 16:34.552
earnings sheets on my bedside table.

16:34.586 --> 16:37.321
You're smart and you're attractive,

16:37.356 --> 16:40.057
but no one's going to hand you anything.

16:40.092 --> 16:41.959
You want to be me?

16:41.994 --> 16:43.928
Put down the book.

16:46.465 --> 16:48.532
(no voice)

16:51.803 --> 16:53.537
JEANNIE: Hey. Hey. Come here.

16:56.174 --> 16:57.241
So?

16:57.275 --> 16:59.210
Anything on DollaHyde?

16:59.244 --> 17:01.379
Nope. Still in la-la mode,
waiting on the data dump.

17:01.413 --> 17:03.080
(sighs) What do you think?

17:03.115 --> 17:04.749
These guys even gonna make it to an IPO?

17:04.782 --> 17:06.317
Cain and Abel? Yeah, no.

17:06.351 --> 17:08.352
I might just have to kill
Lukas if he doesn't.

17:08.387 --> 17:09.887
Maybe Lukas will step down.

17:09.921 --> 17:11.922
Maybe he'll just swag himself to death.

17:11.957 --> 17:13.557
(laughs)

17:13.592 --> 17:15.826
I mean, he was obviously value added

17:15.861 --> 17:16.926
for the launch, but you know,

17:16.962 --> 17:18.529
at this phase, I think we
got to worry about...

17:18.563 --> 17:20.263
So, Marty, I am gonna get going.

17:20.298 --> 17:21.365
And, um, I'll see you tomorrow.

17:21.400 --> 17:22.333
Okay? Whoa. Whoa.

17:22.367 --> 17:24.769
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie.

17:24.803 --> 17:26.436
It's 2:00.

17:26.471 --> 17:27.637
Mm-hmm.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.473
(laughs)

17:29.508 --> 17:31.609
It's 2:00 in the afternoon

17:31.643 --> 17:32.777
on your first day.

17:32.811 --> 17:33.778
Yep.

17:35.247 --> 17:36.914
You gonna be working from home? Maybe.

17:36.948 --> 17:39.917
Like you've never left in
the middle of the afternoon.

17:39.951 --> 17:42.086
Hey, how 'bout you just
tell me where you're going?

17:42.120 --> 17:43.087
How hard is that?

17:43.121 --> 17:44.455
It's not hard.

17:44.489 --> 17:45.823
I just don't see how that's
any of your concern.

17:45.857 --> 17:48.859
You don't see where it's my concern?

17:48.894 --> 17:50.394
Maybe it has something to do with the fact

17:50.429 --> 17:52.063
that my name's on the goddamn wall.

17:52.097 --> 17:53.030
Oh, is it?

17:53.065 --> 17:54.298
I hadn't noticed.

17:54.332 --> 17:56.667
Just out of curiosity,
which "associate" am I?

17:56.701 --> 17:58.736
Oh, boo.

17:58.770 --> 18:00.438
I would've put Van Der Hooven up there,

18:00.472 --> 18:02.106
but I think we might have
run out of office space.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.140
Hilarious.

18:03.175 --> 18:04.675
I'll see you tomorrow, Marty.

18:04.709 --> 18:06.710
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute!

18:10.849 --> 18:12.149
What the fuck, Jeannie?

18:12.217 --> 18:14.018
I could ask you the same thing.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.119
In fact, I will.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.287
What the fuck, Marty?

18:16.321 --> 18:17.721
You know, since you got here,

18:17.756 --> 18:19.023
you've been acting like a real...

18:19.057 --> 18:20.124
...bitch?

18:21.226 --> 18:22.193
What? A cunt?

18:22.227 --> 18:23.494
Were you gonna s...?

18:23.528 --> 18:25.396
I wasn't gonna call you a... Well, I'm sorry

18:25.430 --> 18:28.332
that I have upset your little fantasy.

18:28.366 --> 18:30.234
You know, the one where I come back,

18:30.268 --> 18:31.435
we fall into old habits,

18:31.470 --> 18:33.070
and then I'm your girl Friday again.

18:33.105 --> 18:35.973
And I'm so flattered that you've
gone to all to this effort.

18:36.007 --> 18:39.710
"Wow, this big beautiful
office for me? Thanks, Daddy!"

18:39.744 --> 18:41.512
I'm not trying to be your daddy.

18:41.546 --> 18:44.248
Oh, I'm well aware of what
you're not trying to be.

18:44.282 --> 18:47.585
I've been working forever

18:47.652 --> 18:49.019
to have something that's mine, okay?

18:49.054 --> 18:51.522
Not mine and somebody else's-- just mine.

18:51.556 --> 18:55.926
But I-I gave you what you wanted
because you're great consultant,

18:55.961 --> 18:58.429
and the firm is stronger with you here, okay?

18:58.463 --> 19:00.197
Thank you for the pat on the head.

19:00.232 --> 19:01.532
But it's not about my work.

19:01.566 --> 19:03.667
I mean it is, but... What is it?

19:03.702 --> 19:07.404
You had torpedoed your
very last relationship,

19:07.439 --> 19:08.906
outside of your family, maybe,

19:08.940 --> 19:10.708
with someone you gave a fuck about,

19:10.742 --> 19:13.744
and you saw that barely open window

19:13.778 --> 19:15.779
to your soul creaking shut.

19:15.814 --> 19:18.182
That's why you went to
all this effort, Marty.

19:18.216 --> 19:19.683
And that's why I'm here.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.653
Have a great afternoon.

19:22.687 --> 19:23.787
See you tomorrow.

19:25.023 --> 19:25.856
You, too.

19:25.891 --> 19:28.259
And just for the record...

19:28.293 --> 19:30.895
you didn't give me shit.

19:30.929 --> 19:32.296
I took it.

19:47.512 --> 19:49.947
All right, I think I have
got the perfect one for you.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.248
You are really gonna like this one.

19:51.283 --> 19:53.050
Only 42,000 miles.

19:53.084 --> 19:54.418
It is in great shape.

19:54.452 --> 19:55.452
It's so pretty.

19:55.487 --> 19:56.987
Yeah, it is.

19:57.022 --> 19:59.390
MAN (over P.A.): Mike, pick up on line three.

19:59.424 --> 20:01.125
Mike, pick up on line three.

20:02.761 --> 20:04.728
Jesus!

20:07.098 --> 20:09.033
(siren wails in distance)

20:10.268 --> 20:11.535
(door opens, keys jangle)

20:12.971 --> 20:13.971
Hey, Pop.

20:14.005 --> 20:15.472
Hey.

20:15.507 --> 20:16.440
How was your day?

20:16.474 --> 20:17.474
How was Jeannie?

20:17.509 --> 20:19.243
(scoffs)

20:19.277 --> 20:20.644
Uh, fine.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.046
It was good.

20:22.080 --> 20:23.280
LEX: You pencil dicks bringing
that shit into our house?!

20:23.315 --> 20:24.682
Hell no!

20:24.716 --> 20:26.550
She think we're at a truck stop?

20:26.585 --> 20:28.285
I've had a word with them.

20:28.320 --> 20:29.186
Several, actually.

20:29.221 --> 20:31.422
They're teenagers.

20:31.456 --> 20:32.756
You know, it's like trying

20:32.791 --> 20:34.592
to get a Parisian not to speak French.

20:34.626 --> 20:36.827
ROSCOE: And one!

20:36.861 --> 20:38.062
In your face, bitches!

20:39.564 --> 20:42.700
Dad, the game wasn't even over yet.

20:42.734 --> 20:43.934
Oh, it's over yet.

20:43.969 --> 20:45.936
Lex, can I give you a ride home?

20:45.971 --> 20:47.371
I would love to have a chat.

20:47.405 --> 20:49.006
Take a rain check on that. I drove.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.374
You drive?

20:50.408 --> 20:51.575
Yep.

20:54.879 --> 20:56.213
(mouthing)

20:56.248 --> 20:57.348
Yeah.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.749
ROSCOE: I wish you didn't

20:58.783 --> 21:00.718
have to leave so quick.

21:00.752 --> 21:03.587
I don't have to leave right this second.

21:12.197 --> 21:14.698
Uh, think I'll go to to my room.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.001
Good night, Lex.

21:21.473 --> 21:23.607
Dad, please?

21:32.250 --> 21:34.118
You're really pretty, you know that?

21:35.487 --> 21:36.620
Thanks.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.224
You're supposed to say
something nice to me now.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.526
You're fuckin' amazing.

21:54.639 --> 21:55.839
Later, dude.

22:01.646 --> 22:03.247
Later... (chuckles)

22:04.983 --> 22:06.150
All clear, Dad!

22:11.089 --> 22:14.258
So, uh, you and Lex, huh?

22:14.292 --> 22:15.559
Me and Lex what?

22:17.262 --> 22:18.395
Nothing.

22:18.430 --> 22:19.930
Go finish your homework.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.765
(knocking on door)

22:22.801 --> 22:24.635
Hey, hey, listen.

22:24.669 --> 22:26.670
There is no way I'm leaving this room again.

22:26.705 --> 22:28.405
Okay, okay.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.574
Hey, what's up, man? I'm Dre Collins.

22:30.608 --> 22:32.276
Dre Collins! Yeah, I-I know!

22:32.310 --> 22:34.044
Please come in!

22:34.079 --> 22:35.079
Hey.

22:36.414 --> 22:39.416
Dad, why didn't you tell
me Dre Collins was coming?

22:39.451 --> 22:40.918
I didn't know Dre Collins was coming.

22:40.952 --> 22:43.120
No, your pops told me you were
hyped on what we're doing,

22:43.154 --> 22:45.489
so here-- I hooked you up with
a little something something.

22:45.523 --> 22:47.191
Oh...!

22:47.225 --> 22:48.692
Thank you!

22:49.527 --> 22:50.694
All right.

22:53.131 --> 22:54.064
Nice spot.

22:54.099 --> 22:55.933
Thanks.

22:55.967 --> 22:57.501
You just in the neighborhood?

22:58.937 --> 23:00.704
Can we talk?

23:03.608 --> 23:05.809
Got a hell of a view, my friend.

23:05.844 --> 23:07.111
Thank you.

23:11.282 --> 23:15.152
So... you seen our operation.

23:15.186 --> 23:16.587
What do you think?

23:16.621 --> 23:18.922
Well, doesn't matter what I think.

23:18.957 --> 23:20.290
It matters what you think.

23:20.325 --> 23:22.760
Who the fuck do you think I am?

23:22.794 --> 23:25.028
What are you doing, giving me the
consultant runaround?

23:25.063 --> 23:28.165
Oh... (wry laugh) you came over...

23:28.199 --> 23:30.300
at night...

23:30.335 --> 23:32.202
to my residence...

23:32.237 --> 23:33.937
without your partner.

23:33.972 --> 23:36.840
Or was that just an oversight?

23:38.009 --> 23:39.543
Should we ring him up?

23:42.847 --> 23:45.349
I think what you think.

23:48.453 --> 23:50.354
I want him out.

23:50.388 --> 23:52.556
Any way you can convince him to sell?

23:52.590 --> 23:54.024
Not a chance.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.859
Lukas is all "DollaHyde my baby."

23:55.894 --> 23:59.596
Well, DollaHyde my baby, too.

23:59.631 --> 24:01.131
And he's gonna fuck us up.

24:01.166 --> 24:02.966
No, he's not.

24:06.805 --> 24:10.073
Oh, fuck.

24:10.108 --> 24:12.709
You know, I hate that it's come to this.

24:12.744 --> 24:14.211
I really do.

24:14.279 --> 24:16.246
We've been partners for a long time.

24:16.281 --> 24:20.284
Look, it's just the nature of things.

24:20.318 --> 24:23.086
Hmm.

24:23.121 --> 24:26.924
Lukas and I, we were just
shorties when we met.

24:26.958 --> 24:30.394
Me and my people, we moved out from New York.

24:30.428 --> 24:32.396
And he got shipped out from Atlanta

24:32.430 --> 24:34.498
to live with his granny.

24:34.532 --> 24:36.300
Two nine-year-olds on corner lookout,

24:36.334 --> 24:39.536
arguing about who's cooler, Kid or Play?

24:39.571 --> 24:42.072
Oh, come on, it's Play. Of course it is!

24:42.106 --> 24:43.740
I mean, how is that even an argument?

24:43.808 --> 24:45.275
That's not an argument!

24:45.310 --> 24:47.444
Kid gets no pussy, and keeps getting beat up!

24:47.479 --> 24:49.480
Get his ass beat, right? Yeah!

24:49.514 --> 24:50.814
(both chuckle)

24:55.153 --> 24:57.321
Lukas and I, we made sense once.

24:59.324 --> 25:00.991
We did.

25:01.025 --> 25:02.926
But now...

25:06.231 --> 25:09.299
Can't go home again?

25:09.334 --> 25:10.934
(buzzing and ringtone playing)

25:19.644 --> 25:21.044
Oh... (sighs)

25:26.551 --> 25:28.051
(phone rings)

25:29.354 --> 25:30.754
(groans)

25:34.626 --> 25:35.926
I fucked up.

25:35.960 --> 25:38.028
Curled up naked in a used car lot?

25:38.062 --> 25:39.463
You sure did fuck up.

25:39.497 --> 25:43.433
No, I mean, I fucked up with you.

25:43.468 --> 25:46.069
What the fuck happened to
you today anyway, man?

25:46.104 --> 25:47.638
Listen, I need a new car.

25:47.672 --> 25:49.673
It's hard to get a feel for
the upholstery with pants on,

25:49.707 --> 25:51.508
so I figured, "Why not take the shits off

25:51.543 --> 25:52.643
and see what happens, right?"

25:52.677 --> 25:55.145
(siren whooping, engine revving)

25:55.179 --> 25:57.080
I lost my shit, man.

25:57.115 --> 25:58.615
And I don't know

25:58.650 --> 26:01.785
how much of it was drugs and alcohol,

26:01.819 --> 26:04.555
how much of it was...

26:04.589 --> 26:05.789
was my life.

26:08.760 --> 26:10.093
(sighs)

26:13.498 --> 26:15.032
But you're okay, right?

26:15.066 --> 26:17.034
Are you okay enough to be alone?

26:17.068 --> 26:18.602
Yeah, I just need to get some sleep.

26:18.636 --> 26:20.304
Put your seatbelt on.

26:27.345 --> 26:30.514
So Doug and Jeannie,
first day of work today, right?

26:30.548 --> 26:35.152
Getting the old band back
together for a reunion tour.

26:35.186 --> 26:37.087
So you asked me to bail you
out of jail so you could

26:37.121 --> 26:38.555
hit me up for a job? No, that's not...

26:38.590 --> 26:39.890
'Cause if you think I'm gonna forget

26:39.924 --> 26:41.291
every fucking thing that
happened just because, you know,

26:41.326 --> 26:43.493
I had a soft spot for you in
the middle of the night because

26:43.528 --> 26:44.728
if you called me...
I don't think you're gonna

26:44.762 --> 26:45.729
forget anything that happened, okay?

26:45.763 --> 26:47.297
Are you fucking kidding me?

26:47.332 --> 26:48.699
I called you because there's not many people

26:48.733 --> 26:49.733
in my life that I could... Clyde...

26:49.767 --> 26:53.170
it's not important.
