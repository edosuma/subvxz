WEBVTT

00:05.606 --> 00:06.640
*

00:06.774 --> 00:09.610
* And the wind may howl... *

00:10.644 --> 00:11.612
TYLER:
All right, listen up.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.181
Here's a map of the area.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.015
Our 44orum brethren are
setting up a perimeter

00:15.149 --> 00:17.251
outside the hotel
as we speak.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.654
May even send some guys in
to scope the inside.

00:20.788 --> 00:22.256
We'll make sure
those mutants stay put

00:22.356 --> 00:23.657
until they get
what's coming to them.
(chuckles)

00:23.791 --> 00:25.659
Then we'll flush 'em back
to the freak show

00:25.793 --> 00:27.027
where they belong.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.197
(laughter)

00:29.330 --> 00:31.199
You good, Shane?

00:31.332 --> 00:33.267
You've been mighty quiet
this whole time.

00:33.367 --> 00:36.437
Not afraid to go toe-to-toe
with these creatures, are you?

00:36.537 --> 00:38.672
(chuckles softly)

00:39.673 --> 00:40.674
TYLER: Damn!

00:40.808 --> 00:42.276
It's always the quiet ones.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.477
(laughter)

00:43.611 --> 00:44.545
It's game time, boys!

00:44.678 --> 00:45.846
Let's make 'em pay!

00:45.979 --> 00:48.048
Run 'em out
of town. Yeah!

00:48.182 --> 00:51.018
Let's clean up the
Motor City! Yeah.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.686
(laughter)

00:57.491 --> 00:59.693
Okay, you can come out.

00:59.827 --> 01:01.995
Look, it's safer down here
than in one of those rooms.

01:02.130 --> 01:04.165
Seriously, Manny,
it's safe down here.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.800
Only a handful of people
know about this place, and...

01:06.900 --> 01:08.502
we can trust them.

01:08.636 --> 01:09.970
(gasps)

01:11.505 --> 01:13.207
Don't think I'm ever
gonna get used to that.

01:13.341 --> 01:15.909
(both chuckle)

01:16.043 --> 01:17.511
Man.

01:17.645 --> 01:20.414
I can't believe you're
back here in the flesh.

01:20.548 --> 01:21.915
Well, kind of.

01:22.049 --> 01:24.252
Was starting to think
I'd never see you again.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.655
I would never let that happen.

01:34.061 --> 01:34.928
So...

01:35.062 --> 01:36.029
tell me everything.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.365
What happened to you?

01:38.866 --> 01:41.735
I arrived at Belle Isle
just like the other 4,400,

01:41.869 --> 01:44.272
confused and terrified.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.274
Then I discovered that
I could make myself invisible,

01:46.407 --> 01:48.342
which freaked me out at first.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.278
Then...

01:50.411 --> 01:52.280
I realized that I could hide
from the government.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.614
When they did their counts,

01:53.747 --> 01:55.015
I stayed off their radar.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.517
Damn.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.952
But why didn't you tell me
you were here?

01:59.086 --> 02:01.622
I mean, why the-the clocks,
the cyphers? I...

02:01.755 --> 02:04.458
You were a part-time Fed, Jha.

02:04.592 --> 02:05.893
I needed to make sure
that I could trust you,

02:06.026 --> 02:07.361
that you knew me enough
to find me.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.463
What the hell, Manny?

02:09.597 --> 02:12.766
I mean, your tests
almost drove me insane.

02:12.900 --> 02:16.570
Government's been after me
since before I got taken.

02:16.704 --> 02:19.240
Now that I'm back, they
definitely see me as a threat.

02:19.373 --> 02:20.574
And trust me,
they're not gonna do anything

02:20.708 --> 02:23.110
to protect the folks
in this sanctuary

02:23.244 --> 02:24.812
from the actual threat
that's coming.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.715
There's this 44orum online,

02:27.815 --> 02:30.251
people spreading hate
and misinformation.

02:30.384 --> 02:32.653
Yeah, I read about
those asshats.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.222
You think they're actually
planning something?

02:34.322 --> 02:36.390
Yes, I do.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.626
And with the government
rounding us up

02:38.759 --> 02:41.595
from the tip line,
we got to convince any 4,400

02:41.729 --> 02:44.064
that's still out there
to come back here, ASAP.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.300
We're stronger

02:46.434 --> 02:47.935
if we're all here together.

02:49.603 --> 02:51.239
Okay, but...

02:51.339 --> 02:52.740
but what about you, huh?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.675
How are you?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.577
You okay?

02:57.511 --> 02:59.347
Look, I'm worried
about all of y'all,

02:59.480 --> 03:02.015
but... you,

03:02.149 --> 03:03.584
you good?

03:05.085 --> 03:07.821
I'm good.
(takes deep breath)

03:07.955 --> 03:10.123
I just want to make sure
we're all safe.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.194
(elevator dings)
We don't know much about them,
but things seem promising.

03:14.328 --> 03:17.865
This BHN company is sending
food and other supplies.

03:17.998 --> 03:21.335
They're letting us handle the
day-to-day running of the hotel.

03:21.469 --> 03:22.936
Maybe they're legit.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.205
Well, from what I found
from some Internet sleuthing,

03:25.339 --> 03:27.775
Sienna Stone is
the founder and CEO.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.444
She's some renegade,
anti-government

03:30.544 --> 03:32.446
tech entrepreneur dedicated

03:32.546 --> 03:34.682
to building sustainable
communities.

03:34.815 --> 03:38.386
So maybe their heart's
in the right place,

03:38.519 --> 03:40.020
unlike the government.

03:41.455 --> 03:42.490
JI-EUN:
Reverend Johnston.

03:42.623 --> 03:43.857
REV:
Ji-Eun.

03:43.991 --> 03:45.058
You're all right.

03:45.192 --> 03:47.495
Yes, I am.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.663
I thought you'd take your
chances anywhere else but here.

03:49.797 --> 03:50.864
I'm sorry about that.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.466
I just got freaked out.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.368
I'm just glad I was there
to rescue her

03:54.502 --> 03:56.737
from that jerk that called her
into the tip line.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.973
So, you and your friend

04:00.073 --> 04:01.742
would like to seek sanctuary?

04:02.410 --> 04:04.244
Not exactly.

04:05.346 --> 04:07.681
I heard a rumor you could
take away powers.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.750
*

04:09.883 --> 04:11.218
Well, I...

04:11.352 --> 04:15.823
Sometimes, I glow
without even knowing it.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.858
Harold and I want to live
a normal life

04:17.991 --> 04:19.226
together.

04:20.494 --> 04:23.263
I want you to take
my powers away,

04:23.397 --> 04:25.733
and I want you to marry us.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.070
We know what it looks like.

04:30.203 --> 04:32.840
Ji-Eun and I were together
when she went missing,

04:32.940 --> 04:35.676
but I never gave up hope.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.512
I knew one day I'd find her.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.848
And here we are
over 30 years later.

04:40.948 --> 04:43.250
Time couldn't stop our love.

04:43.384 --> 04:45.786
Your story is proof
that God looks out

04:45.919 --> 04:48.389
for true love and hope.

04:48.522 --> 04:50.290
I would be honored
to officiate your wedding

04:50.424 --> 04:53.093
and relieve you of your powers
if you're sure.

04:53.226 --> 04:55.596
Yes, I am. Thank you.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.465
There's so much to do.

04:57.598 --> 05:00.100
(chuckles): I don't
even know where to start.

05:00.233 --> 05:01.535
Um...

05:01.635 --> 05:03.804
Could you help me
with everything?

05:03.937 --> 05:05.406
Since you've been married
before?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.476
(chuckles)

05:11.779 --> 05:13.414
Mr. Davis.

05:13.547 --> 05:15.315
There's someone here
that say they know you.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.891
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.427
I've never seen this man before.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.229
(chuckles):
Oh, my word!

05:29.329 --> 05:30.464
Gotcha.
Sherlock.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.332
Watson.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.903
Ah, I'm so pleased it's you
and not one of those people.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.839
Have you heard of
this 44orum?

05:38.972 --> 05:40.674
The patriotic nuts
who believe things about us

05:40.808 --> 05:42.610
that break my brain?

05:42.743 --> 05:44.177
Yeah.
Indeed.

05:44.311 --> 05:48.015
There are rumors that
some of them are posing

05:48.148 --> 05:50.350
as 4,400 seeking sanctuary

05:50.484 --> 05:52.285
in order to infiltrate
the hotel,

05:52.420 --> 05:53.587
which is why we have

05:53.687 --> 05:55.856
guard shifts
to provide security now.

05:55.989 --> 05:57.958
It's not a rumor.
It's true.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.327
We have to be careful in here.

06:00.461 --> 06:01.795
Okay? They are coming for us.

06:01.929 --> 06:02.796
How do you know this?

06:02.930 --> 06:04.598
Are you...

06:04.698 --> 06:05.933
all right?

06:07.501 --> 06:10.103
Yeah. Yeah. Just...

06:10.203 --> 06:12.039
glad to be back.

06:12.172 --> 06:15.342
(sighs)
I'm so pleased to see you.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.646
She's a real beauty.
(chuckles)

06:18.779 --> 06:21.314
Bought it from an estate sale
a few months ago.

06:21.449 --> 06:23.050
But I can't seem to get my hands

06:23.183 --> 06:25.352
on the original track
from the 1930s.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.620
I could go with you next time.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.722
We could find our next project.

06:28.856 --> 06:30.958
Like that time we restored
that phonograph from the 1880s.

06:31.058 --> 06:33.393
Yeah.
(chuckles)

06:33.527 --> 06:35.228
It's good to have my trusty
assistant back in the attic.

06:35.362 --> 06:36.730
ANNOUNCER (on radio):
And up next,

06:36.864 --> 06:39.366
the radio host you hate to love,
Kevin Wellington,

06:39.500 --> 06:42.002
telling it like it is.

06:42.135 --> 06:43.504
Giving you
the kick in the butt you need

06:43.637 --> 06:44.905
to stop being one of the sheep

06:45.038 --> 06:46.574
and start thinking for yourself.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.175
You're listening
to that man again?

06:48.308 --> 06:50.243
You've been playing him nonstop
since I got back.

06:50.377 --> 06:53.647
What happened to
Miami's News Breakdown?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.382
What do you know about
Kevin Wellington?

06:55.516 --> 06:57.050
Nothing.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.719
Except he's clearly
a racist radio hack

06:58.852 --> 07:00.220
who's making America dumber
by the second.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.822
All he does is
spin outrageous stories

07:01.922 --> 07:05.425
about everyone from-from
immigrants to Black people

07:05.559 --> 07:07.595
to the 4,400.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.229
And right now,
I'm kind of all three.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.264
Yeah, well, he keeps it real.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.200
He makes some good points, too.

07:15.536 --> 07:16.870
Oh, my God, I totally forgot.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.439
The, uh, the Meet the 4,400
event is on.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.374
You can see my friends.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.279
LOGAN (on TV):
Yeah, um, you know,

07:26.413 --> 07:28.381
having Hayden in our home
was unexpected,

07:28.516 --> 07:31.118
but, you know, he's brought
so much good into our lives.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.854
I can't imagine him being
anywhere else.
Okay, so that's Logan.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.957
He's Shanice's, like, husband,
or ex or whatever.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.126
All this stuff is just for show.

07:39.259 --> 07:41.629
It's all fake.
Daddy, it's not.
Just-just watch.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.597
(sighs)

07:44.932 --> 07:47.300
(panicked screaming on TV)
Oh, my God.

07:47.434 --> 07:49.469
Up. Up in the window.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.805
Up.
Mildred?

07:51.939 --> 07:54.908
(Mildred shouting)
That little white girl...

07:55.042 --> 07:56.877
MILDRED:
Well, I'll give you a reason!
She-She's doing this.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.411
Oh, my God.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.580
She's trying to murder that man.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.114
No, no. She...

08:01.248 --> 08:03.651
No, this is who they are.

08:03.784 --> 08:06.554
(screaming on TV)
This is what they can do.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.055
LADONNA:
No, no.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.723
(whispers):
This is what you are.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.625
Something's wrong.
I got to call Andre.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.126
(TV turns off)

08:13.260 --> 08:14.995
(sighs) Thanks.

08:21.468 --> 08:25.005
What are you doing?
Can I have my phone?

08:25.138 --> 08:26.740
Dad?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.475
Daddy?
(lock clicks)

08:33.446 --> 08:34.915
Daddy?

08:35.015 --> 08:37.517
Daddy, let me out!

08:37.651 --> 08:39.687
*

08:46.293 --> 08:47.695
Okay, well,
you know I had to ask.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.663
At least see
if Mildred's interested.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.765
I mean, she is kind of wanted
by...

08:51.865 --> 08:53.667
well, everyone.

08:54.668 --> 08:56.269
All right, cool.
Thanks.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.205
(sighs)

08:58.338 --> 09:01.541
And Claudette is--
big shocker-- a no.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.176
Claudette, huh?

09:03.310 --> 09:04.845
Thought you and Carla were
going to make it.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.480
Let's just say I wasn't
exactly the best partner

09:07.615 --> 09:08.849
after you disappeared.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.517
I mean,

09:10.651 --> 09:13.220
she did everything she could
to help, but I was...

09:13.353 --> 09:14.487
an undeserving ass.

09:14.622 --> 09:15.723
I'm sorry, Jha. I...

09:15.856 --> 09:17.357
I'm sorry it was
so hard for you.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.893
No.
Just the man I was looking for.

09:21.662 --> 09:23.496
Um, hey, what's up?

09:23.631 --> 09:25.733
Can you get a marriage license
for Ji-Eun and Harold?

09:25.866 --> 09:27.735
Since it's easier
for you to come and go.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.803
Uh...

09:29.903 --> 09:32.205
Yeah, sure. This is my...
I'm Jorge.

09:33.306 --> 09:34.908
Jharrel and I went
to college together.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.910
Don't worry,
I'm a 4,400 supporter.

09:37.044 --> 09:38.411
Reverend Johnston.

09:38.545 --> 09:40.413
Pleasure to meet you.
Likewise.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.754
I should go.
Jharrel, thanks for your help.

09:46.887 --> 09:48.388
No problem.

09:51.692 --> 09:52.893
So,

09:53.026 --> 09:54.394
we are Jorge now?

09:55.428 --> 09:57.430
I can't let word get back
to the government.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.669
I'll find you later.

10:07.675 --> 10:08.942
You okay?

10:09.076 --> 10:11.444
My powers, I-- Um...

10:11.578 --> 10:13.714
I can't turn invisible.

10:13.847 --> 10:14.948
Wait, w-what do you mean?

10:15.082 --> 10:16.616
I mean, I can't, like...

10:16.750 --> 10:18.719
I've never not been able--
I mean, since it started,

10:18.852 --> 10:20.420
I've never not been able to...
It's okay.

10:20.553 --> 10:23.691
All right, just hide out here
until it comes back.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.558
Then dive into this.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.129
Always calmed you down,
remember?

10:29.262 --> 10:31.631
I will help you figure this out
when I get back.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.639
Andre said you were back.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.041
How long are you visiting?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.609
I'm staying.

10:42.743 --> 10:44.411
I heard you're in charge
of room assignments.

10:44.544 --> 10:46.546
(scoffs) Feels like I am
in charge of everything

10:46.646 --> 10:47.915
around here.
(chuckles)

10:48.048 --> 10:49.717
Oh, I am a diplomat.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.585
Events coordinator, landlord.
You name it.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.121
Ew.
(chuckles)

10:54.254 --> 10:55.288
But how are you?

10:55.422 --> 10:56.323
Where have you been?

10:56.456 --> 10:57.657
I'm fine. Fine.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.827
I just could really use
a shower.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.829
So I was hoping I could get
my old room back.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.231
Or, honestly, any room.
It does not matter.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.166
A lot of 4,400 are coming back,

11:06.299 --> 11:08.168
so you may end up
with a roommate.

11:08.301 --> 11:09.336
That's fine.

11:10.637 --> 11:12.773
Be nice to not be alone
for a change.
Great.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.942
That makes my job easier.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.977
And what is with this wedding
y'all are throwing

11:17.110 --> 11:18.445
for Ji-Eun and her boo?
(chuckles)

11:18.578 --> 11:19.813
Because when I left,
we barely had money

11:19.947 --> 11:21.614
for decent clothes,
and now there are

11:21.749 --> 11:23.516
racks of dresses
for her to try on.

11:23.650 --> 11:25.252
How can we afford all this?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.187
Oh, when BHN found out
about the wedding,

11:27.320 --> 11:28.789
they gave us money
to pay for it.

11:28.922 --> 11:30.190
Sweet.

11:30.323 --> 11:31.491
Or shady?

11:32.492 --> 11:33.961
I don't know yet.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.797
Hmm. Well, if you need a DJ,
I'm your girl.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.431
I might just take you up
on that.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.167
Great.

11:40.300 --> 11:41.601
I love weddings.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.838
You know, I always thought
my dad was gonna walk me

11:44.972 --> 11:47.374
down the aisle, but...

11:47.507 --> 11:49.109
things are kind of different
now.

11:50.110 --> 11:51.344
REPORTER (on TV):
It's clear that the 4,400
have been hiding

11:51.478 --> 11:53.113
their true nature
from the world.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.048
What could they want from...
(TV turns off)

11:57.350 --> 11:58.285
Look, you have to stop this.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.853
You have to let me go.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.289
I'm just waiting for
the iguana to show itself.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.024
What iguana?

12:04.157 --> 12:05.158
I am your daughter.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.660
Yeah. They said you'd say that.

12:07.795 --> 12:10.197
Who? Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.000
I know that you
and the rest of the 4,400

12:13.133 --> 12:14.301
trick innocent people.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.237
I read all about it
on the 44orum.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.139
You manipulated me,

12:19.239 --> 12:22.075
claiming to be my daughter.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.543
Kevin Wellington was right.

12:23.676 --> 12:25.813
(sighs)
The 4,400 are just posing

12:25.913 --> 12:28.481
as long-lost family members
and then killing them.

12:28.581 --> 12:31.418
No, that's not what--
How can I...

12:33.420 --> 12:35.488
*

12:37.190 --> 12:40.027
Remember when you took
me and Mom to the botanicals

12:40.160 --> 12:41.694
when I was eight?

12:41.829 --> 12:43.730
And I gave Mom
a really hard time

12:43.864 --> 12:45.933
because I wanted to wear
that white dress,

12:46.066 --> 12:47.767
the one she was saving
for Easter.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.337
And you made me wear this,

12:50.437 --> 12:53.073
like, horrid bright
orange shirt.

12:53.206 --> 12:57.945
And I was so mad, until we got
to the butterfly enclosure.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.914
And then
out of nowhere,

13:01.048 --> 13:04.117
all the, all the butterflies
started flocking to my shirt

13:04.251 --> 13:06.719
till I was covered
in butterflies.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.389
And then
I wasn't mad anymore.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.562
It was the first time you
called me your little butterfly.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.301
Not all the powers are bad.

13:21.434 --> 13:23.636
And Mildred only did
what she did because...

13:23.770 --> 13:27.074
they treated her horribly
at this facility, Ypsi Med.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.741
But we're still us.

13:30.043 --> 13:32.980
Look, I'm-I'm still me.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.282
I'm still your little butterfly.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.999
(gasps)
It was a nice try,

13:52.132 --> 13:54.167
but I know you're not
my daughter.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.835
You stole
her memories somehow,

13:55.969 --> 13:57.737
and you're trying to
use them against me.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.173
But I know the truth,

14:00.307 --> 14:02.075
and you are not human.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.412
If you won't show
your true self,

14:05.512 --> 14:07.347
then I'll just have to make you.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.118
Dad!

14:12.619 --> 14:14.321
(lock clicks)

14:15.822 --> 14:17.157
All right,
in most cases,

14:17.290 --> 14:18.959
the pawn is considered
the weakest on the board.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.094
But, if it reaches the other
side without being captured,

14:21.194 --> 14:23.796
it can be promoted to any other
chess piece except a king.

14:23.931 --> 14:26.466
Okay. Okay. Pawn promotion.
I think I got that.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.268
Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty cool.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.804
But good luck getting your pawn
past my defense.

14:31.939 --> 14:34.141
Oh... All right.

14:36.476 --> 14:40.147
So, wh-what happened
with the landscaping contract

14:40.280 --> 14:42.315
for Hockeytown Properties?

14:42.449 --> 14:44.884
I mean, Ms. Bridget said
you didn't get the job.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.520
Yeah, um...

14:47.654 --> 14:49.556
You know, they-they pulled out
last minute,

14:49.689 --> 14:51.291
decided to go with someone else.

14:51.391 --> 14:55.228
Yeah, is it because you were
on TV supporting us,

14:55.362 --> 14:58.465
then Mildred tried
to kill Bill Greene?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.900
Now she's on these posters...

15:01.034 --> 15:02.970
I'm scared of
what she might do next,

15:03.070 --> 15:05.172
or what she might
get others to do.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.008
Look, either way,

15:08.141 --> 15:11.211
I'm sorry she caused you
to lose work.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.546
Maybe it had nothing to do
with Mildred.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.415
It's as much
a mystery to me

15:15.548 --> 15:18.251
as chess. (laughs)

15:20.353 --> 15:22.055
Look, I'm just glad

15:22.189 --> 15:24.524
that you decided not to go
back to that hotel.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.260
It's not where I feel
like I belong anymore.

15:27.394 --> 15:31.398
You know? But I also feel safe
here with you all.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.433
That you are.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.105
All right, so now
I-I can do this, yeah?

15:40.540 --> 15:42.409
Okay, let's try this again.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.676
What?

15:47.114 --> 15:49.382
We can work here
undisturbed now.

15:49.516 --> 15:53.220
I must show you
what the COBOL code found.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.123
Apparently, the government was
looking for something called

15:56.256 --> 15:58.258
ZMT in our blood.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.760
ZMT? Never heard of it.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.296
Neither had I.
We'll figure out what it is.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.098
(chuckles)
Now that you're back,

16:05.232 --> 16:07.800
I'm confident we'll solve
this mystery in no time.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.371
(sighs)

16:12.772 --> 16:14.141
If you wish to discuss it,

16:14.274 --> 16:15.875
I shall listen.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.711
* *

16:18.811 --> 16:19.946
(clattering)

16:20.080 --> 16:22.149
Who's there?

16:27.787 --> 16:29.289
Sorry. Sorry.

16:29.422 --> 16:32.159
Uh, I didn't think anyone else
was going to come in here.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.328
I'm Jorge,

16:35.462 --> 16:37.464
a 4,400 friend of Jharrel's.

16:37.597 --> 16:38.965
He never mentioned you.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.567
You know,
I'm gonna go get Shanice,

16:40.667 --> 16:41.801
and she'll let us know
if you're one of us

16:41.934 --> 16:43.403
or a 44orem-er trying
to sneak in.

16:43.503 --> 16:44.637
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.840
All right,
the truth is

16:47.974 --> 16:50.943
I'm Manny, Jharrel's brother.

16:52.745 --> 16:54.747
I'm a 4,400 just like you.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.783
The government is after me,

16:56.916 --> 16:59.319
and I'm hiding here because it's
the only place that's safe.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.821
W-Wait, you're,
like, Manny-Manny?

17:01.954 --> 17:03.022
Jharrel must be so pleased

17:03.156 --> 17:04.324
you're back.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.758
Did he tell you?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.460
We found the COBOL code
among your books.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.296
No.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.298
Then spill the tea.
Yes.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.832
What is ZMT,

17:12.965 --> 17:14.801
and how is it connected
to us being zapped here?

17:14.934 --> 17:17.304
I know it's in our blood,
but please tell us,

17:17.437 --> 17:20.039
does it explain how we got here,
or why we have powers?

17:20.173 --> 17:22.709
ZMT is the reason
I'm afraid for my life.

17:23.610 --> 17:24.711
What does that mean?

17:24.844 --> 17:27.380
The answers that
you think you want

17:27.514 --> 17:28.881
are only gonna lead
to the deaths

17:29.015 --> 17:30.217
of people that you love.

17:31.784 --> 17:34.121
So, for their sake
and the sake of the other 4,400,

17:34.221 --> 17:36.723
let this ZMT thing go

17:36.856 --> 17:38.725
and forget you ever saw me.

17:45.298 --> 17:46.999
CLAUDETTE: And there are
these apps that let you

17:47.134 --> 17:49.001
send money to people and ones
that can tell you the time

17:49.136 --> 17:50.537
on the other side of the world.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.339
(chuckles):
Can you believe that?

17:54.507 --> 17:57.244
Hey, stranger. (laughs)

17:58.711 --> 18:01.581
Glad to see you survived
your time on the inside.

18:01.714 --> 18:03.183
I was worried about you.

18:03.316 --> 18:04.817
Thanks.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.154
But I just want to put
the whole thing behind me.

18:08.155 --> 18:09.589
Please say that
you changed your mind

18:09.722 --> 18:10.890
and you're gonna come stay here
in the hotel.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.559
That ain't for me,
you know that.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.927
But I am happy to bring Mildred
back here, though.

18:15.061 --> 18:17.430
All right, fine.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.999
Maybe you could mix me up
a drink sometime.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.068
Show off what you learned
at that bartending convention.

18:22.202 --> 18:25.505
I'm sure we could figure
something out.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.841
All right, cool.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.278
(takes deep breath)

18:32.879 --> 18:34.581
All right, what gives?

18:36.015 --> 18:37.550
You are happier
than a dog with two tails,

18:37.684 --> 18:39.786
and it can't be just
'cause you're glad to see me.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.955
Okay. Yes.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.458
It's my brother. He's back.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.595
(laughs):
Well, I'll be.

18:48.728 --> 18:49.962
I mean, he's all
you've been talking about,

18:50.096 --> 18:51.964
not to mention
I'm staying at his place.

18:52.098 --> 18:53.600
I need to thank him in person.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.303
Uh...

18:56.436 --> 18:59.272
I promise not to bite.

19:01.374 --> 19:03.476
Have you connected with anyone
from the time you left?

19:03.610 --> 19:07.380
I've reached out to my son,
Quincy,

19:07.480 --> 19:10.116
hoping we could find
some common ground.

19:10.250 --> 19:11.651
But I haven't heard from him.

19:11.784 --> 19:14.987
Whatever happens, the 4,400
are my children now.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.724
*

19:17.824 --> 19:19.058
That's the one who...

19:19.158 --> 19:21.461
She hurt that man.
Mildred?

19:21.594 --> 19:23.095
What is she doing here?

19:23.230 --> 19:25.565
Brother Harold, your nerves
are understandable,

19:25.665 --> 19:28.768
but I can assure you,
Mildred is one of us.

19:34.274 --> 19:35.942
Sister Mildred.

19:36.075 --> 19:39.612
In from the cold
and fully transformed.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.681
The guy looked really terrified.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.182
Do you think it'll be okay

19:43.316 --> 19:46.419
if I just come back?

19:46.519 --> 19:49.322
Many understand how badly
the government treated us,

19:49.456 --> 19:52.024
some worse than others.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.527
I understand
what Bill Greene did to you,

19:54.661 --> 19:56.463
why you did what you did.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.966
Thank you for stopping me.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.870
Still, I want my powers back.

20:04.003 --> 20:05.538
Can you do that?

20:05.672 --> 20:08.708
I'm not sure exactly
how it works yet,

20:08.841 --> 20:10.209
but I'll try.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.054
(takes deep breath)

20:27.660 --> 20:30.630
*

20:33.132 --> 20:35.234
I'm sorry.

20:35.368 --> 20:37.370
It's okay, I guess.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.707
ANDRE: I know he's
Jharrel's brother, but...

20:40.840 --> 20:42.709
I'm not inclined to trust
someone we just met

20:42.842 --> 20:44.477
with decisions
that could affect us all.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.846
I don't trust him
either, but...

20:46.979 --> 20:50.517
I don't think ZMT is what really
matters right now, Andre.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.419
You don't know
what it's like out there.

20:52.552 --> 20:55.054
The things people believe
about us, it is scary.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.656
Look, that's why I'm here

20:56.756 --> 20:58.558
and not with my mom.

21:00.192 --> 21:03.496
You all are my family.

21:03.596 --> 21:06.766
And I came here to warn you
that danger is real,

21:06.899 --> 21:08.200
and it's immediate.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.902
What happened?

21:10.036 --> 21:11.604
In Miami?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.408
I saw what's out there
firsthand.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.277
(scoffs) I saw that anyone
can turn against you

21:18.411 --> 21:21.381
because they've been brainwashed
by this nonsense.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.415
What nonsense exactly?

21:22.549 --> 21:23.850
That we're iguanas.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.218
That we're imposters.

21:26.353 --> 21:27.854
That we'll steal their souls
in the night.

21:27.954 --> 21:29.422
That we'll eat their babies.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.858
None of it is real
or makes any sense.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.462
They will believe anything

21:35.595 --> 21:37.964
that excuses
their irrational hatred of us.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.866
Whatever narrative works
for them.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.102
(scoffs softly)

21:43.235 --> 21:46.238
We're not human to them.

21:46.373 --> 21:48.775
And how can we reason with them
if that's what they think?

21:54.547 --> 21:55.415
There it is.

21:55.548 --> 21:56.483
Wow.

21:56.616 --> 21:57.750
It really does look like her

21:57.884 --> 21:58.818
from the pictures
you've shown me.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.319
Daddy, who is this?

22:00.453 --> 22:03.089
Shane,
he's a vet friend of mine.

22:03.222 --> 22:06.058
Does a lot of work
with exotic animals.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.294
He's gonna help me figure out
what happened to my daughter.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.328
I am your daughter.

22:09.462 --> 22:10.763
We both know you're not.

22:10.897 --> 22:12.499
(softly):
Oh, my God.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.667
But you're gonna tell me
what you did with her.

22:14.801 --> 22:16.068
SHANE:
Don't worry. We'll get

22:16.168 --> 22:17.804
to the truth,
one way or the other.

22:23.743 --> 22:26.245
Oh. Oh, boy, oh, boy. Ah!

22:32.318 --> 22:33.486
JHARREL:
Manny?

22:34.487 --> 22:36.022
You can come out now.

22:40.660 --> 22:42.161
Jharrel.

22:42.294 --> 22:44.831
I asked you to keep
my whereabouts to yourself.

22:44.964 --> 22:48.034
I know,
but you don't really say no

22:48.167 --> 22:49.969
to Claudette.

22:53.305 --> 22:55.141
I heard a lot about you.

22:55.274 --> 22:56.976
It's nice to finally meet you.

22:57.109 --> 22:59.512
It's nice to meet you, too.

22:59.646 --> 23:00.980
(chuckles softly)

23:02.515 --> 23:03.983
Well, as much
as I'd love to stay,

23:04.116 --> 23:05.317
I have to get going.

23:05.452 --> 23:06.953
My shift's starting soon.

23:07.053 --> 23:09.388
Okay, well, I'll catch you
after the wedding.

23:09.522 --> 23:11.658
Yeah.

23:11.791 --> 23:14.461
*

23:16.328 --> 23:18.330
(phone vibrates)
Would you look at that.

23:18.465 --> 23:19.732
JHARREL:
Yeah?

23:19.866 --> 23:21.701
I guess we're both
learning a lot.

23:22.635 --> 23:23.870
Huh, Jorge?

23:24.804 --> 23:27.239
*

23:40.019 --> 23:41.888
One of the greats.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.590
It's a shame
most people nowadays

23:43.723 --> 23:45.692
have no idea who he was.

23:45.825 --> 23:47.193
Hmm.

23:49.161 --> 23:50.763
(Manny sighs)

23:51.864 --> 23:53.432
I'm Jorge.

23:53.566 --> 23:55.267
I'm not in the mood to chat.

23:55.401 --> 23:57.069
(chuckles)

23:57.203 --> 23:59.606
All right, I'll be quick,
Claudette.

23:59.739 --> 24:01.708
*

24:01.841 --> 24:03.209
Don't worry.

24:03.342 --> 24:04.511
I'm pro-4,400.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.115
I heard about how you ousted
that anti-4,400 bartender

24:09.248 --> 24:10.517
and I thought

24:10.617 --> 24:12.351
there's more
that I could teach you.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.753
Teach me?

24:13.886 --> 24:15.688
(scoffs) You're wasting
your time.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.089
I don't need your help.

24:18.558 --> 24:19.959
Revolutions of the past started

24:20.092 --> 24:21.728
in church basements
and closed quarters.

24:21.861 --> 24:25.632
Now we mobilize
out in the open.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.537
I want to level
the playing field.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.038
Teach you how to use

24:32.138 --> 24:33.640
modern skills of resistance
and organization.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.441
Help you hone your powers.

24:35.575 --> 24:36.576
No one's gonna give

24:36.709 --> 24:38.444
the 4,400 their freedom,

24:38.578 --> 24:40.146
their power.

24:40.279 --> 24:41.380
You've got to take it.

24:45.417 --> 24:47.286
It's what Stokely believed.

24:50.256 --> 24:52.625
Come to one of our meetings,
see what you think.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.227
If you like it,

24:55.327 --> 24:56.929
you can come train with me
for a few weeks.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.002
Think about it.

25:11.477 --> 25:13.245
(sighs)

25:14.614 --> 25:16.448
Claudette.
Claudette, wait.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.917
What the hell, Jorge?

25:18.017 --> 25:19.852
Manny?
Whoever you claim to be.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.254
Did Jharrel see you run
out here? What does he think...

25:22.354 --> 25:23.856
He got a call to come pick up
the marriage license.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.858
Listen, I can explain.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.026
Explain what?

25:27.159 --> 25:28.427
That you lied to me?

25:28.527 --> 25:29.829
A-And now, you're lying
to your brother,

25:29.962 --> 25:31.263
letting him think
we've never met before.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.965
Jharrel is not ready
to hear the truth.

25:33.866 --> 25:36.168
Not like you.
So now you want me to lie
to him, too?

25:36.302 --> 25:37.637
Oh, you have got some nerve.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.338
You have every right
to be angry with me.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.808
But don't let this distract you
from the movement.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.042
(sighs)

25:43.175 --> 25:44.476
Look, I saw

25:44.611 --> 25:46.212
the posters you put up.

25:47.313 --> 25:50.516
Using that telekinetic girl,
that was genius.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.685
That's what we need,

25:52.819 --> 25:54.721
a rallying call,

25:54.854 --> 25:56.288
for people to see her power.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.458
She doesn't have her power
anymore. Rev took it away.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.795
He can take powers away.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.832
But she is still a symbol,
even without her power.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.334
She was brave enough
to fight for our freedom.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.803
Which is exactly why
you need to stay focused.

26:10.903 --> 26:12.504
The 4,400 need you.

26:12.639 --> 26:14.206
Even if that means
not telling Jharrel the truth.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.644
(knocking)

26:18.978 --> 26:20.713
What are you so hyped up about?

26:20.847 --> 26:24.383
It just so happens that
I have some hot tea to sip.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.252
Jharrel's brother, Manny,

26:26.385 --> 26:28.688
is alive, and staying here,
in the hotel.

26:28.821 --> 26:29.889
Manny?
Mm-hmm.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.023
But...

26:31.157 --> 26:32.859
LaDonna and I stumbled upon him

26:32.992 --> 26:34.393
in the cocktail lounge earlier.

26:34.526 --> 26:37.196
And get this, he's a 4,400, too.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.832
Wow.

26:39.932 --> 26:42.168
Well, Jharrel must be thrilled
to have him back.

26:42.268 --> 26:45.337
Can't wait to meet him.
Uh, does he need a room?

26:45.437 --> 26:47.406
Well, I'm not sure
you'll be able

26:47.539 --> 26:48.908
to meet him just yet.

26:49.041 --> 26:52.111
His return is supposed to be
on the down low.

26:55.081 --> 26:56.883
More wedding planning, I see.

26:57.016 --> 26:58.417
(chuckles)

26:58.550 --> 27:01.120
Just when I think
I'm almost done,

27:01.253 --> 27:03.622
I get another request
from the happy couple.

27:06.025 --> 27:07.894
It must be hard,

27:08.027 --> 27:10.963
watching this joyful reunion.

27:11.097 --> 27:12.564
I'm sure it's
stirring up feelings

27:12.699 --> 27:13.733
about your own family.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.301
About Logan.

27:16.936 --> 27:19.605
Well, it's not that, exactly.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.540
(chuckles)

27:21.640 --> 27:25.211
I'm exhausted
from wedding planning

27:25.311 --> 27:28.781
and running the hotel.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.649
I just...

27:32.084 --> 27:34.320
I don't feel
like I have a choice.

27:34.453 --> 27:36.655
And sometimes I wish
I could just be free

27:36.789 --> 27:38.157
of all of it, you know.

27:38.290 --> 27:40.993
My-my life before seemed...

27:41.127 --> 27:42.895
easier, you know?

27:44.630 --> 27:47.967
Well, I'm here to help
with whatever you need.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.002
You just say the word, okay?

27:52.071 --> 27:54.106
Thank you, Andre.
Hmm.

27:54.240 --> 27:57.509
(sighs) You're one of
the bright spots in all of this.

27:59.946 --> 28:02.014
I know what might
lift your spirits.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.484
Would you do me the honor

28:05.617 --> 28:08.120
of accompanying me
to tonight's festivities?

28:08.254 --> 28:10.156
It would make me
the luckiest man there.

28:10.289 --> 28:12.191
Outside of Ji-Eun's betrothed,
of course.

28:12.324 --> 28:14.626
(laughs)

28:14.761 --> 28:18.030
I would love to.

28:19.498 --> 28:21.600
All right,
let's try this again.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.102
We both know I haven't gotten
any better since last time.

28:23.202 --> 28:24.636
(both laugh)

28:24.771 --> 28:26.705
Look, chess is all about
pushing your opponent

28:26.839 --> 28:28.274
to a corner
without them realizing it

28:28.374 --> 28:29.441
until it's too late.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.343
All right.

28:35.647 --> 28:38.785
(chuckles):
What are you doing, bud?

28:41.653 --> 28:43.389
(tires screeching)
Are you okay?

28:43.522 --> 28:44.891
Yeah.

28:46.492 --> 28:48.527
*

28:50.830 --> 28:52.899
What in the world?

29:03.309 --> 29:05.011
* I cannot wait
until the weekend... *

29:05.144 --> 29:09.215
I just feel like this huge
weight has been lifted.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.717
I can only imagine.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.085
Is he gonna want his place back?

29:13.219 --> 29:15.054
(chuckles) I don't...

29:15.187 --> 29:16.588
know what he wants.

29:16.722 --> 29:18.891
You know, I just want him here.

29:19.892 --> 29:23.195
So, he told you he's a 4,400
just like us?

29:23.329 --> 29:26.665
Yeah, I'm still trying to wrap
my brain around everything.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.435
Trying to, I don't know,
be a good brother.

29:29.568 --> 29:31.437
Trust him.

29:32.438 --> 29:35.607
I was hard on him in the past.

29:37.776 --> 29:41.613
Just be careful, okay?

29:41.747 --> 29:45.584
W-What the 4,400 went through...

29:45.717 --> 29:47.386
it changed us.

29:48.754 --> 29:53.259
Manny may be dealing
with more than he's telling you.

29:56.595 --> 29:58.064
(indistinct chatter)

29:59.231 --> 30:00.366
You ready?

30:05.537 --> 30:07.239
Tell me.

30:09.441 --> 30:12.244
When a child hurts themself,

30:12.378 --> 30:13.880
they only know they're hurt

30:13.980 --> 30:16.248
because of how
the adults around them react.

30:17.249 --> 30:18.918
Pain is learned,

30:19.051 --> 30:21.153
and it can be unlearned.

30:23.422 --> 30:25.457
(takes deep breath)

30:27.626 --> 30:29.661
If I want full control
of my powers,

30:29.795 --> 30:32.598
I have to unlearn the pain.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.235
It is the only way
to open my mind

30:36.335 --> 30:37.569
to what is possible.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.939
To embrace what only you can do.

30:40.072 --> 30:43.475
Remember, the 44orum-ers are not
gonna stop coming after you.

30:43.609 --> 30:45.344
This...

30:45.477 --> 30:47.013
this is how you
protect yourself.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.847
(groans softly)

30:54.686 --> 30:56.488
What do you feel?

30:58.490 --> 30:59.791
Nothing.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.331
Good.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.865
Now it's time
to return to your life

31:06.999 --> 31:08.534
and prepare the others
for the coming fight.

31:08.667 --> 31:12.371
It's up to you to get
the word out for the 4,400.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.840
Tell them to embrace
their power.

31:14.974 --> 31:16.308
Everything else will
fall into place.

31:16.442 --> 31:18.110
So, you're gonna tell me
who you really are?

31:19.845 --> 31:22.514
You're way too connected to have
returned like the rest of us.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.550
You're right.

31:24.683 --> 31:25.985
I'm not a 4,400.

31:26.118 --> 31:28.120
Well, then who are you?

31:28.220 --> 31:30.522
And why are you so invested
in what happens to us?

31:30.656 --> 31:32.291
For now, all you
need to know is

31:32.391 --> 31:33.892
that I'm here on
a different mission.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.895
I'll tell you more about it,

31:37.029 --> 31:38.297
when the time is right.

31:42.468 --> 31:44.470
*

31:47.006 --> 31:48.174
Thank you.
You're welcome.

31:49.375 --> 31:51.243
All right,
you sure you want to do this?

31:51.377 --> 31:53.412
You know that Bridget,
Mariah and I want you

31:53.545 --> 31:55.014
to live with us, right?

31:55.147 --> 31:56.715
Look, it's safer
for everyone.

31:56.848 --> 31:59.585
Look, if anything happened
to any of you, I...

31:59.718 --> 32:01.520
I wouldn't be able to live
with myself.

32:01.653 --> 32:02.754
Hayden!

32:03.822 --> 32:05.591
You're back!

32:05.724 --> 32:08.360
Mildred, you're here.

32:08.494 --> 32:09.928
Did you come for the wedding?

32:10.062 --> 32:11.563
The wedding?

32:11.697 --> 32:13.032
Oh, who's getting married?

32:13.165 --> 32:14.166
Ji-Eun and Harold.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.934
Oh.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.369
Okay, um...

32:17.503 --> 32:18.604
No, I, uh,

32:18.737 --> 32:20.206
I'm just bringing Hayden back.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.608
Well, you have to stay,
Mr. Kaminski.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.110
The more, the merrier.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.512
(chuckles)
Yeah, please, stay.

32:26.612 --> 32:27.746
I-If it's not
too much trouble.

32:28.947 --> 32:31.417
All right.
I'll go move the car.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.289
I missed you, Hay.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.759
How are you?
Tell me everything.

32:42.061 --> 32:43.262
*

32:43.395 --> 32:45.431
(lively chatter)

32:46.398 --> 32:47.299
Come on!

32:47.433 --> 32:50.069
Go! Yes, yeah!

32:50.202 --> 32:51.637
Whoo!
(cheering)

32:51.770 --> 32:53.305
Right there! Right there.
Put 'em up, put 'em up.

32:53.439 --> 32:54.640
Put 'em up, put 'em up.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.709
Yeah...! Lesbi-Pins!

32:57.809 --> 32:58.644
Woo-hoo!

32:58.777 --> 32:59.645
Bam, put 'em up!

32:59.778 --> 33:01.113
Did you see that?

33:01.247 --> 33:03.115
I wasn't sure I was
in the right place.

33:03.249 --> 33:04.950
Oh, I know. It's okay.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.585
It's hard to believe that
I'm a cryptologist,

33:06.718 --> 33:07.819
triple agent

33:07.953 --> 33:10.622
and an athlete,
all in my spare time.

33:11.623 --> 33:13.325
Wait, does bowling count
as a sport?

33:13.459 --> 33:14.826
Hell yeah, it does.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.795
What's wrong with you?

33:25.904 --> 33:28.074
Called you here
'cause it was loud.

33:28.174 --> 33:29.841
We're less likely
to be recorded,

33:29.975 --> 33:32.144
and I'm sticking to my routine--

33:32.278 --> 33:34.146
less red flags that way.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.783
And your schedule involves
the Lesbi-Pins?

33:38.784 --> 33:42.354
Don't tell me you're more of a
Motor City Rollers kind of guy.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.490
(chuckles)
More of a Feather Bowler.

33:44.623 --> 33:45.857
That's acceptable.

33:45.991 --> 33:47.326
(both laugh)

33:47.459 --> 33:48.627
Hey.

33:48.760 --> 33:50.429
Thank you for helping me
find my brother.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.532
Uh, you are an evil genius.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.134
I know.

33:55.267 --> 33:57.269
How are you handling
all this cloak-and-dagger?

33:57.369 --> 33:59.171
I know it's got to be tough.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.173
(sighs) Yeah.

34:01.307 --> 34:04.543
I realized I had to do
everything I could to help.

34:04.676 --> 34:09.148
My mom doesn't want me sticking
my neck out, but...

34:09.281 --> 34:12.151
it's the hard decisions
that matter, right?

34:12.284 --> 34:14.220
Amen to that.

34:14.353 --> 34:17.055
And listen, after
what Jessica put you through,

34:17.189 --> 34:19.725
I had to find out
what happened to Manny,

34:19.858 --> 34:21.293
why he was so important,

34:21.393 --> 34:23.462
why the government was hell-bent
on finding him.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.164
That's 'cause he refused
to work for them.

34:25.297 --> 34:26.365
Not exactly.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.167
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

34:28.300 --> 34:31.137
Manny's work involved
something called ZMT.

34:31.237 --> 34:33.405
The government thinks
that it's connected

34:33.539 --> 34:36.908
to what makes the 4,400 so...

34:37.042 --> 34:38.244
unique.

34:38.377 --> 34:40.646
Okay, w-wait.
What are you saying?

34:40.746 --> 34:42.414
'Cause Manny got zapped
and appeared on Belle Isle,

34:42.548 --> 34:43.982
like everybody else.
J...

34:44.082 --> 34:45.917
He's not telling you everything.

34:46.051 --> 34:48.420
The government's looking for
Manny because they need him,

34:48.554 --> 34:52.191
because he knows something about
how the 4,400 just showed up,

34:52.324 --> 34:54.893
which means that
he knows more

34:55.026 --> 34:58.029
about all of this
than he's been letting on.

35:06.238 --> 35:07.773
Ji-Eun. Harold.

35:07.906 --> 35:10.542
Your love story is
a parable for us all.

35:10.676 --> 35:12.110
Ji-Eun, are you ready

35:12.244 --> 35:14.846
for me to strip you
of your powers?
I am.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.291
It worked.

35:25.424 --> 35:27.893
Your power is gone.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.433
Thank you for giving me
my life back.

35:34.566 --> 35:35.934
SHANICE:
Now there's only
one more thing

35:36.067 --> 35:37.803
for us to do.

35:37.936 --> 35:39.638
Just need both of
your signatures

35:39.771 --> 35:41.072
on your marriage license.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.774
Then, we can get
to your wedding.

35:42.908 --> 35:45.611
(chuckles)
I can't wait to be your husband.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.780
*

35:49.981 --> 35:51.450
MILDRED:
The ceremony was groovy.

35:51.583 --> 35:54.119
Ji-Eun and Harold seemed
so happy.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.721
(chuckles)

35:55.821 --> 35:57.723
And thank you for helping me
pick out this outfit.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.825
That's what roomies do,
right? They, I don't know,

35:59.958 --> 36:02.060
lend each other clothes
and have movie nights.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.995
Speaking of which,
we really do need to do, like,

36:04.129 --> 36:06.732
a proper Drew Barrymore binge.

36:08.334 --> 36:10.502
(chuckles) Trust me,
you're gonna love her.

36:10.636 --> 36:11.570
(laughs)

36:11.670 --> 36:13.305
You know what, and honestly,

36:13.439 --> 36:14.840
it's-it's really good to be back

36:14.973 --> 36:18.009
and living with somebody
who I can actually trust.

36:19.110 --> 36:21.079
And we can all face
whatever's coming together.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.514
Almost all of us.

36:22.648 --> 36:25.451
I know my sister's
at Ypsi Med,

36:25.584 --> 36:27.018
and I'm not giving up

36:27.152 --> 36:28.754
until I free her.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.623
Hey, Jharrel.

36:31.757 --> 36:33.124
Hey.

36:33.259 --> 36:34.626
See the cake I made
for the happy couple?

36:37.663 --> 36:38.930
I still got it.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.266
It's dope.

36:40.366 --> 36:41.533
It better be.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.269
Took me two days
to make that thing,

36:43.369 --> 36:44.770
and trying to get it over here
without ruining it...

36:46.104 --> 36:48.374
Now I just need the knife
to cut the cake.

36:48.507 --> 36:50.309
I swear I brought it down here,
but...

36:51.310 --> 36:52.511
Anyway,

36:52.644 --> 36:54.346
where's Manny?
I'm excited to meet him.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.547
I actually can't find him.

36:55.681 --> 36:57.383
I don't know
where he would've gone,

36:57.516 --> 36:58.950
and I really need
to talk to him.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.486
I'm sure he's around here
somewhere.

37:00.619 --> 37:03.455
* No, no, no, no, no. *

37:03.555 --> 37:07.025
* Hold on,
I'm telling you the truth *

37:07.158 --> 37:09.060
* You need me, baby
(both laugh)

37:09.194 --> 37:11.897
* Just like I need you. *

37:12.030 --> 37:13.665
(chuckles)

37:13.799 --> 37:14.900
Wow. (laughs)

37:15.033 --> 37:16.468
ANDRE:
Aw, Logan.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.004
So glad you could join us
for this special occasion.

37:19.137 --> 37:21.307
Oh, yeah, man. You know,
it's nice seeing everybody

37:21.407 --> 37:23.475
in such good spirits.
I couldn't agree more.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.177
I'll go grab us some drinks.

37:29.515 --> 37:30.749
How are you holding up?

37:32.217 --> 37:34.420
(sighs) It's-it's been a lot.

37:34.553 --> 37:35.587
(chuckles)

37:35.721 --> 37:37.589
Between managing the-the hotel

37:37.723 --> 37:40.158
and planning this weeding,

37:40.258 --> 37:43.094
I haven't really had
a moment to myself.

37:44.563 --> 37:47.599
Like, is this it?

37:47.733 --> 37:49.835
(chuckles):
Is this my life now?

37:49.935 --> 37:51.269
Are you kidding me?

37:51.403 --> 37:53.772
You're managing this whole place
by yourself,

37:53.905 --> 37:55.674
and you're doing
a damn good job at it.

37:56.908 --> 37:59.778
Yeah, I just don't know
who I am anymore.

37:59.911 --> 38:02.548
You're still you.

38:02.681 --> 38:04.082
You've always wanted
to help people,

38:04.215 --> 38:05.351
and that's exactly
what you're doing.

38:05.451 --> 38:07.686
What you're doing is important.

38:09.355 --> 38:11.690
(Mariah Carey's
"We Belong Together" playing)

38:13.425 --> 38:16.294
* Oh...

38:18.397 --> 38:19.931
This is...
Our wedding song.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.801
* Oh
What, you think I forgot?

38:22.934 --> 38:24.135
(both chuckle)

38:24.269 --> 38:25.471
You want to dance?

38:25.604 --> 38:27.606
Nah, I'm not sure we should...
Come on.

38:29.240 --> 38:30.742
One dance.

38:30.876 --> 38:32.444
* I didn't mean it
For old times' sake.

38:32.578 --> 38:34.245
* When I said
I didn't love you so *

38:34.380 --> 38:36.114
* I should've held on tight *

38:36.247 --> 38:37.949
* I never should've let you go
Okay, you win.

38:38.083 --> 38:39.785
* I didn't know enough,
and I was stupid *

38:39.918 --> 38:43.989
* I was foolish,
I was lying to myself *

38:44.122 --> 38:45.223
* I could not fathom... *

38:45.323 --> 38:48.226
(Shanice laughs)
What?

38:48.326 --> 38:50.729
You were always such a mushball
at weddings.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.163
(laughs)

38:52.297 --> 38:54.800
I'm glad to see
that hasn't changed.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.402
Yeah.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.905
They seem like
the real deal.

39:00.005 --> 39:02.140
I'm rooting for them.

39:02.273 --> 39:04.843
Yeah, me, too.

39:04.976 --> 39:08.346
* Oh, what I wouldn't give
to have you lying by my side *

39:08.480 --> 39:11.650
* Right here, 'cause, baby *

39:11.783 --> 39:15.821
* When you left I lost
a part of me *

39:15.954 --> 39:17.656
(music playing faintly)

39:17.789 --> 39:18.990
(door opens)

39:19.991 --> 39:21.159
(door closes)

39:22.327 --> 39:24.796
Is there something
I can help you with?

39:24.930 --> 39:26.632
I know what you did.

39:28.333 --> 39:29.935
I'm not sure I'm following.

39:31.336 --> 39:33.271
You stripped me of my power.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.141
And I want it back.

39:38.644 --> 39:40.712
You said you weren't...

39:40.846 --> 39:43.381
*

39:49.187 --> 39:50.956
I don't know how to do that.

39:54.059 --> 39:56.695
You knew that already,
didn't you?

39:56.828 --> 39:59.064
Maybe.

39:59.197 --> 40:02.801
But what was
that thing you said?

40:04.503 --> 40:07.405
"All things are possible

40:07.539 --> 40:09.374
to him who believeth."

40:10.876 --> 40:12.644
What do you believe, Isaiah?

40:15.213 --> 40:17.015
* I can't sleep at night
(chuckles)

40:17.148 --> 40:18.750
* When you are on my mind
Ready? Here we go. Ready?

40:18.884 --> 40:20.919
* Bobby Womack's
on the radio... *

40:21.052 --> 40:23.088
(both laugh)

40:29.060 --> 40:30.529
(gasps)

40:30.662 --> 40:31.930
What?

40:32.063 --> 40:33.431
Excuse me. I just...

40:33.565 --> 40:35.200
I-I have to...

40:36.568 --> 40:39.004
*

40:40.405 --> 40:41.339
LADONNA:
All right, ready?

40:41.439 --> 40:43.274
One, two, three.

40:43.408 --> 40:44.876
I'll do one this way.

40:45.010 --> 40:47.178
And one, two, three.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.020
What?

41:06.364 --> 41:08.634
(gasping, groaning)

41:10.435 --> 41:12.571
I know this is
hard to believe,

41:12.704 --> 41:14.305
but this is
for the greater good.

41:14.439 --> 41:17.208
(groaning)

41:33.491 --> 41:34.793
*

41:39.397 --> 41:41.299
(panting)

41:41.432 --> 41:43.468
LOGAN:
What the...?
Oh, my God.

41:43.602 --> 41:45.771
Rev. Rev!

41:45.904 --> 41:47.939
Can you hear me?

41:48.073 --> 41:49.741
Rev.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.743
Stay with me, Rev.
