00:38.898 --> 00:41.399
-Kevin, put that down.

00:41.433 --> 00:44.003
Put that down, Kevin.

00:44.036 --> 00:45.704
Alright, class.

00:45.738 --> 00:47.539
Class!

00:47.572 --> 00:50.575
Please give your attention
to Dorothy.

00:50.609 --> 00:53.880
Kevin!
Put. that. down!

00:53.913 --> 00:56.381
-Kevin, put that down.

01:00.652 --> 01:01.854
-Hi, everyone!

01:01.888 --> 01:03.388
I'm Dorothy Goodwin

01:03.421 --> 01:05.024
and I'm running
for class president

01:05.057 --> 01:07.592
because I see a better
Alabaster Elementary

01:07.626 --> 01:08.728
in our future.

01:08.761 --> 01:10.695
-Boo!
-Let's start by rewarding

01:10.730 --> 01:14.332
faster tidy times
with longer recesses

01:14.366 --> 01:15.567
and start a bully box,

01:15.600 --> 01:16.736
where you can say
you're being bullied

01:16.769 --> 01:17.804
and the principal <i>has</i>

01:17.837 --> 01:19.038
to read it.

01:21.073 --> 01:23.776
To quote my favorite
Founding Father,

01:23.810 --> 01:25.978
Thomas Jefferson,

01:26.012 --> 01:28.480
"I am opposed to any form
of tyranny

01:28.513 --> 01:29.782
over the mind of men"!

01:29.816 --> 01:32.051
-Who cares?
-Thank you.

01:32.084 --> 01:33.552
- Good job, honey.
- Dad, stop it!

01:33.585 --> 01:35.720
-Okay, okay, sorry, sorry.

01:35.755 --> 01:37.689
-And now, Brent Hart.

01:37.722 --> 01:38.925
Kevin, no!

01:43.729 --> 01:44.897
-Hey, guys.

01:44.931 --> 01:46.933
Um, hi, everybody.

01:46.966 --> 01:48.801
My name is Brent Hart.

01:48.835 --> 01:50.736
Tyr-- T--

01:50.770 --> 01:51.971
T--

01:52.004 --> 01:53.739
<i>T.Rexes</i> are gay!

01:53.773 --> 01:54.841
- Brent!

01:54.874 --> 01:56.408
-I want to be class president

01:56.441 --> 01:58.144
so we can have fries
every day, all day.

01:58.177 --> 02:01.113
I mean, who likes fries,
right, right?

02:01.147 --> 02:04.116
- Fries! Fries!
- Um, I wrote a song about it.

02:04.150 --> 02:05.684
-Yeah, Brent!

02:05.717 --> 02:07.119
-♪ Vote for Brent Hart

02:44.623 --> 02:46.158
-Brent! Brent! Brent! Brent!
-Fat, fat!

02:46.192 --> 02:48.160
Fat!
-Fries!

03:04.243 --> 03:05.912
- You can't fire me!

03:05.945 --> 03:07.545
-I'm not firing you, D.

03:07.579 --> 03:09.148
-Fine, you can't let me go.
-We cannot have

03:09.181 --> 03:12.018
Scott's speechwriter
getting arrested.

03:12.051 --> 03:14.053
You lit a flag on fire.

03:14.086 --> 03:15.788
-Which, again,
was unintentional!

03:15.821 --> 03:17.489
But, just so you're aware,

03:17.522 --> 03:19.125
that has not been illegal
since 1989.

03:19.158 --> 03:20.492
-It was on private property.

03:20.525 --> 03:21.526
-It was a government office.

03:21.559 --> 03:22.661
-And it was a workday.

03:22.694 --> 03:24.196
-I was on my lunch break.
-Okay,

03:24.230 --> 03:25.898
and that's why
I'm bailing you out today.

03:25.932 --> 03:27.066
-I do not want to be bailed out.
-So you can go

03:27.099 --> 03:28.734
and take the weekend off.
-Fiona.

03:28.768 --> 03:29.936
-Go home.
-You have a meeting this weekend

03:29.969 --> 03:31.569
with restaurant union workers.

03:31.603 --> 03:33.072
I have to write those speeches.
-Okay,

03:33.105 --> 03:34.639
we've seen the video.

03:34.673 --> 03:36.075
-There's a video?
That's excellent news.

03:36.108 --> 03:38.177
Then you know that I was well
within my rights.

03:38.210 --> 03:41.479
-Dorothy, no, you look like
a complete psycho in that video.

03:41.513 --> 03:43.215
-I'm sorry, what person
that changed the world

03:43.249 --> 03:45.217
ever didn't look like a psycho
while they were doing it?

03:45.251 --> 03:46.819
The definition
of being a psycho is

03:46.852 --> 03:48.087
that you don't fit
with other people's norms.

03:48.120 --> 03:49.088
The norms in this world
right now

03:49.121 --> 03:50.655
are completely fabricated

03:50.689 --> 03:52.091
in order to hold us all down,

03:52.124 --> 03:53.793
so, if I look like a psycho
in that video

03:53.826 --> 03:55.694
while I'm espousing
my own beliefs,

03:55.728 --> 03:57.495
then I am proud of that video.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.631
What are you -- Wait, I'm sorry.
-We can't let you in.

03:59.664 --> 04:00.866
Fiona said we can't.
-I'm sorry. What are you doing?

04:00.900 --> 04:01.801
-Just --
-What do you mean? I'm sorry,

04:01.834 --> 04:03.535
what did Fiona say?!

04:03.568 --> 04:04.904
Guys, I hired you!

04:04.937 --> 04:05.972
I hired you!

04:10.242 --> 04:11.609
Scott!

04:11.643 --> 04:13.779
Scott!

04:13.813 --> 04:15.081
Scott!

04:15.114 --> 04:16.648
-Dorothy, Dorothy,
I told you not to --

04:16.680 --> 04:18.184
-Fiona, I don't want to talk
to you right now.

04:18.216 --> 04:19.185
Fiona, I really don't
want to talk to you right now.

04:19.218 --> 04:20.652
-What happened to your eye?

04:20.685 --> 04:21.519
Are you okay?
-No, I'm not okay.

04:21.553 --> 04:22.755
The cops tackled me!

04:22.788 --> 04:23.923
I was wearing
a fucking cow mask!

04:23.956 --> 04:26.125
-Senator Powell knew it was you,

04:26.158 --> 04:27.559
okay?
- Who cares?

04:27.592 --> 04:30.662
-You weren't like hidden,
in disguise.

04:30.695 --> 04:32.898
Look, you need to go home
and get some sleep

04:32.932 --> 04:35.134
and we will talk about this
on Monday, please.

04:35.167 --> 04:37.003
-The world is melting down.

04:37.036 --> 04:38.838
We are burning down the only
remaining resources

04:38.871 --> 04:40.940
actually standing
between humanity and death

04:40.973 --> 04:43.743
and we're doing it to create
space for fucking hamburgers

04:43.776 --> 04:45.244
in the day and age
of Impossible meat.

04:45.277 --> 04:46.812
And, meanwhile, the starving
people at our borders

04:46.846 --> 04:48.047
are being treated like animals.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.615
I am not going to go home
and hang out

04:50.648 --> 04:53.651
and like chill back
and like rest.

04:53.685 --> 04:54.920
Please recycle this.

04:54.954 --> 04:56.756
-I'll still consult with you.

04:56.789 --> 04:58.290
I-I was going to keep you
on payroll.

04:58.324 --> 04:59.557
-It's not enough, Scott!

04:59.591 --> 05:00.893
I built this campaign with you!

05:00.926 --> 05:02.261
-I <i>will</i> recycle this!

05:02.294 --> 05:04.263
'Cause that's what people
who care do!

05:04.296 --> 05:06.032
-They're calling you
La Vaca Loca.

05:06.065 --> 05:07.665
-Who's "they"?
-Shit, everyone?

05:07.699 --> 05:09.301
Breitbart started it.
-That definitely means

05:09.335 --> 05:10.870
that Scott's not going to give
me the recommendation I need

05:10.903 --> 05:12.338
to get another job
this election cycle.

05:12.371 --> 05:14.273
-Just get a regular job
and chill for a minute.

05:14.306 --> 05:15.775
-What the fuck are you
talking about,

05:15.808 --> 05:17.109
"get a regular job
and chill for a minute"?

05:17.143 --> 05:18.110
I don't even know
how regular people

05:18.144 --> 05:19.745
are going to their regular jobs.

05:19.779 --> 05:21.313
They all just sit around
kissing each others' asses

05:21.347 --> 05:23.215
in this state
about how fucking great we are

05:23.249 --> 05:25.650
and doing absolutely
nothing about it.

05:25.683 --> 05:26.318
I'm going to Texas.

05:26.352 --> 05:27.787
-Texas, bitch?

05:27.820 --> 05:29.155
You can't live
with your grandfather.

05:29.188 --> 05:31.157
You <i>hate</i> him.
Sounds like you're having

05:31.190 --> 05:32.858
an anxiety attack.
-I'm not.

05:32.892 --> 05:34.760
I've never been more lucid.
I'm going to go to Texas.

05:34.794 --> 05:36.128
Everything that's happening
is happening there.

05:36.162 --> 05:38.297
There's some emergency money
in the toilet.

05:38.330 --> 05:39.597
It'll be fine.

05:39.631 --> 05:41.167
I love you.
-Love you-u-u.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.301
-Bye.

05:42.334 --> 05:43.701
-Bye-e-e.

05:49.842 --> 05:51.609
-Agh!

05:55.181 --> 05:56.648
Please let me in.

07:31.343 --> 07:32.945
- Yeah, I'm coming.

07:49.195 --> 07:50.963
Dorothy.

07:50.996 --> 07:51.997
-Frank.

07:52.031 --> 07:54.466
-Still with the "Frank" shit.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.801
Jesus Christ.

07:55.834 --> 07:57.937
What happened to your face?

07:57.970 --> 07:59.305
-Oh, I...

07:59.338 --> 08:01.240
hit it on a doorframe.
-No, no, I'm talking

08:01.273 --> 08:03.075
about the nose.

08:03.108 --> 08:05.110
-Um, I have a nose ring?

08:05.144 --> 08:07.079
-Oh, shit.
-For a personal taste in style.

08:07.112 --> 08:09.215
- See ya.

08:15.521 --> 08:16.755
That was just bullshit.

08:16.789 --> 08:18.457
Come on in.

08:18.490 --> 08:20.025
Come on in.

08:20.059 --> 08:23.195
When I ask you in, go, please.

08:23.229 --> 08:25.164
-I will walk into this house
because I'm a co-owner

08:25.197 --> 08:26.799
of the house and I will walk in
because I want to.

08:26.832 --> 08:28.400
-So you're walking in
under protest, right?

08:28.434 --> 08:30.135
-I'm walking in --
-Okay.

08:30.169 --> 08:31.036
-Ugh!
-I get it.

08:36.508 --> 08:39.445
I never thought
I'd see you again.

08:39.477 --> 08:42.780
You know that? I didn't know
whether you were even alive.

08:42.815 --> 08:44.116
-I feel like that's
a little dramatic.

08:44.149 --> 08:48.320
I was home like last year
for your birthday.

08:48.354 --> 08:50.155
-That's a long time.

08:50.189 --> 08:52.858
And you remember
what you did that day?

08:52.891 --> 08:55.261
You did your fucking laundry.

08:55.294 --> 08:56.428
-I call every Christmas.

08:56.462 --> 08:58.130
-You never leave your number.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.232
Your ID, it says "Unknown."

09:00.266 --> 09:02.434
-I'm just trying to be safe.
It's really important not

09:02.468 --> 09:04.336
to have a digital thumbprint
with this government...

09:04.370 --> 09:06.105
...so I block my number.

09:06.138 --> 09:08.107
That's not funny.
That's very scary,

09:08.140 --> 09:10.409
the amount of data
that they're collecting on us.

09:10.442 --> 09:11.543
-Well, what else
have you been doing

09:11.577 --> 09:13.479
besides criticizing America?

09:15.381 --> 09:18.884
Um, I'm not criticizing America.

09:18.917 --> 09:20.452
I've been trying to fix America.

09:20.486 --> 09:22.521
-I don't know what "health
care voter" means, but --

09:22.554 --> 09:24.223
-This is already really fun.

09:24.256 --> 09:27.526
I honestly haven't asked you
for anything in a decade,

09:27.559 --> 09:30.596
so if I could just hang out here
and, you know,

09:30.629 --> 09:33.232
use the half of the house
that I technically own

09:33.265 --> 09:34.600
and have been basically
loaning out to you
-Hey.

09:34.633 --> 09:35.868
-for all these years.
-Hey. Don't throw

09:35.901 --> 09:37.136
"technical" at me.
I get it.

09:37.169 --> 09:39.605
I understand it, you know.

09:39.638 --> 09:41.473
You're welcome to stay here,
you know.

09:41.507 --> 09:42.875
-Thanks for the invitation.
-And, uh,

09:42.908 --> 09:45.077
incidentally, while you're here,

09:45.110 --> 09:46.912
if you're not going
to call me Grandpa,

09:46.945 --> 09:49.081
then call me Mr. Goodwin.

09:49.114 --> 09:50.349
Don't call me Frank,

09:50.382 --> 09:52.418
'cause only my friends
call me Frank.

10:03.295 --> 10:05.431
Oh, brother.

15:44.603 --> 15:46.538
-Mm-hmm.
-...it was in the summer

15:46.571 --> 15:47.974
and she and some friends

15:48.975 --> 15:51.944
had started a synchronized

15:51.978 --> 15:53.612
swimming club.

15:53.645 --> 15:55.915
-And this is before it was
even an Olympic event.

15:55.948 --> 15:57.482
-Right. I love it.
-Well.

15:57.516 --> 15:59.418
-Frank tells me

Dorothy, huh?

16:02.955 --> 16:04.690
-My grandmother?
-Mm-hmm.

16:04.723 --> 16:07.225
-I never met her.
She died before I was born.

16:07.259 --> 16:09.428
-Oh, right, yes.
-Wow.

16:09.461 --> 16:10.696
-I-I think I knew that.

16:10.730 --> 16:12.431
-Tell a joke.

16:12.464 --> 16:14.466
-I can't think of a good one
right now.

16:14.499 --> 16:15.768
-Want me to tell one?

16:15.802 --> 16:17.837
Jack and Jill went up the hill.
-Okay.

16:17.870 --> 16:19.237
-They each had a dollar

16:19.271 --> 16:20.572
and a quarter.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.407
-Jill came down with 2 1/2.

16:22.441 --> 16:23.709
You think they went up
for water?

16:26.979 --> 16:28.547
Frank, you're always --

16:28.580 --> 16:31.984
-But that's okay
for me, too, isn't it?

16:32.018 --> 16:34.653
Oh.

-Dorothy, you look great,

16:37.489 --> 16:40.459
I haven't seen you.
It's been so long.

16:40.492 --> 16:42.427
Oh, my gosh!
It's so good to --

16:42.461 --> 16:45.664
It's so good to see you.
It's been like --

16:45.697 --> 16:49.301
It's 10 years
or something crazy?

16:49.334 --> 16:50.702
-Mm.

16:50.737 --> 16:52.337
-I think the last time I saw you

16:52.370 --> 16:54.673
was actually at, um, your dad's

16:54.706 --> 16:56.274
-Funeral.
-...funeral, yeah.

16:56.308 --> 16:56.976
-Yeah.

16:59.812 --> 17:01.013
-Yeah.

17:01.047 --> 17:03.281
-I like your hair.
-Thanks, Frank.

17:03.315 --> 17:05.383
Anyway --
-You know how Greta and I met?

17:05.416 --> 17:06.550
Church.
-We met at church.

17:06.585 --> 17:07.954
-In church.
-Oh, how nice.

17:07.987 --> 17:09.387
-I'm trying to drag him there.
-And so we talked

17:09.421 --> 17:11.958
and she said, "How about
a Sunday dinner?"

17:11.991 --> 17:13.592
Every other family

17:13.625 --> 17:15.660
went off together on Sunday,
except me.

17:15.694 --> 17:16.929
I was alone.
-Well, we have fun.

17:16.963 --> 17:18.363
-Yeah.
-I'm alone half the time, too.

17:18.396 --> 17:20.031
It's so nice for Mae
to have Frank.

17:20.066 --> 17:21.599
-How's Fisher?

17:21.633 --> 17:23.502
-He's good.

17:23.535 --> 17:24.402
-Huh?
-Thanks for asking.

17:24.435 --> 17:26.071
He's good, he's good.

17:26.105 --> 17:28.040
He's good, thank you.

17:28.074 --> 17:30.475
I miss him, though.
I miss him a lot.

17:30.509 --> 17:36.883
Uh, my husband, Fisher, is a --
he is on tour right now, so.

17:36.916 --> 17:38.450
He's --
-Fisher's a flag boy, right?

17:38.483 --> 17:40.318
-He flies a helicopter
for the Army.

17:42.989 --> 17:44.489
-On Sundays,

17:44.523 --> 17:45.490
these son of a bitches,

17:45.524 --> 17:46.893
- telemarketers,

17:46.926 --> 17:48.928
and that doesn't
bother me they call.

17:48.961 --> 17:50.930
How did they get my number?

17:50.963 --> 17:52.631
-You want me to get it, Frank?

17:52.664 --> 17:53.766
- I can also get it.

17:53.800 --> 17:56.035
This is my house.
-No, I'll get it.

17:56.068 --> 17:57.669
- Um --

17:57.702 --> 17:59.371
-You go tell 'em.
-That's part

17:59.404 --> 18:00.807
of the whole government
protection thing

18:00.840 --> 18:02.041
that I was talking to you about

18:02.074 --> 18:02.942
and why you don't want
to give out

18:02.975 --> 18:04.977
all of your information.

18:05.011 --> 18:06.645
The government has

18:06.678 --> 18:07.947
too much information about us.

18:07.980 --> 18:10.348
- Are you still into politics?

18:10.382 --> 18:11.683
-Yep.
-Homicide.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.552
-I have a -- I have a job.

18:15.087 --> 18:16.688

-In Austin.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.423
-Oh, congrats!
-Yeah.

18:18.456 --> 18:20.659

-It's working for a --

18:20.692 --> 18:22.094
a political campaign there.

18:22.128 --> 18:23.528
-Whose?
-Pretty --

18:23.562 --> 18:25.832
Pretty high-level, um,

18:25.865 --> 18:27.967
there, so.
-Good for you.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.036
-But, But, also, you know,
on the other hand --

18:30.069 --> 18:32.738
-Such a difference
in people's lives.
-I also write

18:32.772 --> 18:34.606
freelance stuff,
so if you know anyone

18:34.639 --> 18:36.608
who's looking for --
-You were always
such a good writer.

18:36.641 --> 18:38.543
Well, I work
at the community center.

18:38.577 --> 18:39.846
But they're definitely
not hiring

18:39.879 --> 18:41.713
because they can barely pay me.

18:41.747 --> 18:44.482
But you remember my godmother,
Genie,

18:44.516 --> 18:45.684
from Greta's Guns and Ammo?

18:45.717 --> 18:47.485
You know -- You know Genie?
-Mm-hmm.

18:47.519 --> 18:48.988
-She's the president of the
Women's Chamber of Commerce,

18:49.021 --> 18:51.523
which is this amazing group
of women that I work for.

18:51.556 --> 18:53.692
Anyway, it's a real welcoming,
great group,

18:53.725 --> 18:55.027
and a lot of local businesses,

18:55.061 --> 18:57.629
and, you know,
if you want to come,

18:57.662 --> 18:59.098
we have free lunch every Sunday.

19:02.935 --> 19:04.837
-Hmm.

19:04.871 --> 19:06.772
What time?

19:06.806 --> 19:08.440
-Who here thinks
I color my hair?

19:08.473 --> 19:09.809
Don't answer that.

19:09.842 --> 19:12.111
But the fact that you don't know
is a testament

19:12.144 --> 19:13.880
to my coloring style, okay?

19:13.913 --> 19:15.413
Now, we are having

19:15.447 --> 19:16.949
a cut and color special

19:16.983 --> 19:18.683
all the way through the weekend,

19:18.717 --> 19:21.120
in preparation
for next week's dance

19:21.153 --> 19:22.687
at The Oaks in Schulenburg.

19:22.721 --> 19:23.990
And, y'all,
it's beautiful up there.

19:24.023 --> 19:25.791
It's where I got married.

19:25.825 --> 19:29.896
And my son is playing bass
in a musical trio, um, from --

19:29.929 --> 19:31.197
from young musicians
at the high school

19:31.230 --> 19:32.464
and it's going to be
so much fun.

19:32.497 --> 19:33.665
He promises to get everybody up

19:33.698 --> 19:34.599
and dance on their feet

19:34.633 --> 19:35.467
and have a good time.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.568
Okay, so, thanks, y'all.

19:36.601 --> 19:37.469
Thank you so much.

19:39.939 --> 19:42.842
-Thank you, Barbara, for this
week's Spotlight on savings.

19:45.477 --> 19:48.513
And thank you, Rosa,
for catering this event.

19:48.546 --> 19:50.850
- Ladies, try the tenderloin.

19:50.883 --> 19:52.651
It's got a little kick
in the rub.

19:52.684 --> 19:54.153
Really good.

19:54.186 --> 19:57.089
-And this brings us
to our keynote speaker.

19:57.123 --> 20:00.725
As you know, we don't involve
ourselves directly in politics,

20:00.760 --> 20:02.494
but these are special times.

20:02.527 --> 20:05.197
And, last week,
we unanimously voted

20:05.231 --> 20:08.000
to endorse a spirited young man,

20:08.034 --> 20:10.069
a new voice
for the Republican Party,

20:10.102 --> 20:13.205
a homegrown hero
who's come back here

20:13.239 --> 20:16.208
to open a Ford dealership
in this community

20:16.242 --> 20:17.542
with his father,

20:17.575 --> 20:19.011
Senator Hart.

20:19.045 --> 20:21.914
So, if you're still at the
buffet table, come on in!

20:21.948 --> 20:24.817
You can bring your plate
and give your complete attention

20:24.850 --> 20:26.685
to Brent Hart.

20:29.088 --> 20:30.222
-Thank you.

20:30.256 --> 20:31.757
Thank you, Genie.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

20:31.791 --> 20:33.491
I'm so sorry.

20:33.525 --> 20:37.129
One more thing -- If you buy
a truck from Hart Ford,

20:37.163 --> 20:39.031
you will get a half-price gun

20:39.065 --> 20:41.267
at Greta's Guns and Ammo --
that's my shop --

20:41.300 --> 20:42.802
and I will keep that price

20:42.835 --> 20:44.502
straight through the
primary, so.

20:44.536 --> 20:45.204
Don't tell corporate.
-Don't tell corporate.

20:45.237 --> 20:46.638
-That's what he said.

20:46.671 --> 20:48.040
Brent Hart, everybody.

20:48.074 --> 20:50.142
Brent Hart.
- Thank you so much.

20:50.176 --> 20:52.945
Yeah. I am proud to be running

20:52.979 --> 20:54.679
for state representative

20:54.713 --> 20:57.249
for the prettiest little
district in all of Texas.

20:57.283 --> 20:58.751
- So hot.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.625
<i>-Dorothy! Dorothy!</i>

21:17.136 --> 21:19.005
-If you can dream it,

21:19.038 --> 21:20.538
well, then, you can sell it

21:20.572 --> 21:21.606
in Alabaster.

21:21.639 --> 21:22.808
Ain't that right?

21:22.842 --> 21:24.844
Thank you.

22:16.762 --> 22:18.097
He's running
for state legislature.

22:18.130 --> 22:19.631
-Just come home.
You know, they really

22:19.664 --> 22:20.733
shouldn't have fired you.

22:20.766 --> 22:22.134
<i>You can file and unemployment</i>

-Fuck that! I did not get fired!

22:23.668 --> 22:24.904
I fucking left that job

22:24.937 --> 22:25.805
-Oh.

22:25.838 --> 22:27.206
So you quit.

22:27.239 --> 22:28.207
I see.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.909
He said he just let you go.

22:29.942 --> 22:31.077
-Oh, my God, the woman who is
running against him

22:31.110 --> 22:32.144
has run and lost three times.

22:32.178 --> 22:33.079

22:34.146 --> 22:36.082
<i>-Brent!</i>
<i>A Democrat</i>

22:36.115 --> 22:38.017
has never won.
Never, not a single time.

22:38.050 --> 22:40.152
Everyone is Republican here.
I thought I was a Republican

22:40.186 --> 22:41.887
when I lived here.
It's like the conservative

22:41.921 --> 22:43.823
fucking twilight zone
and something bad is happening

22:43.856 --> 22:44.957
down here, Glenn,
really fucking bad.

22:47.159 --> 22:48.360
<i>I bet he works out in it.</i>

22:48.394 --> 22:50.229
I bet he has
workout photos in it.

22:50.262 --> 22:52.630

22:52.664 --> 22:53.799
<i>-Delay?</i>

22:53.833 --> 22:55.000

Tom DeLay.

22:57.903 --> 22:59.839
-What?

22:59.872 --> 23:02.174
-Tom DeLay.
Tom DeLay.

23:02.208 --> 23:03.742
<i>-Okay, babe, just calm down,</i>

23:03.776 --> 23:06.112
breathe, and I'll call you
tomorrow, okay?

23:06.145 --> 23:08.380
-Tom DeLay.
<i>-Are you okay?</i>

23:08.414 --> 23:10.116
<i>Hello?</i>

23:10.149 --> 23:11.716
<i>-Care most about</i>
<i>-Dorothy!</i>

23:11.750 --> 23:12.885
<i>-and that affect their lives</i>
-We should tell.

23:12.918 --> 23:13.886
<i>-every day.</i>
-Hey, yeah, yeah.

23:13.919 --> 23:14.920
I love you.
<i>-And not</i>

23:14.954 --> 23:16.789
<i>a campaign focused solely</i>

23:16.822 --> 23:18.190
<i>as a referendum on me.</i>
-So...

23:18.224 --> 23:20.192
<i>-So today I am announcing</i>

23:20.226 --> 23:22.328
<i>my intention to resign</i>
<i>my seat in the House.</i>

23:22.361 --> 23:24.330
<i>-When a candidate withdraws</i>
<i>their name</i>

23:24.363 --> 23:26.198
<i>from the ballot in Texas,</i>

23:26.232 --> 23:28.267
<i> then that means no candidate</i> --

23:28.300 --> 23:29.835
<i>in this case, no Republican</i> --

23:29.869 --> 23:32.037
<i>would be on the ballot at all.</i>

23:32.071 --> 23:33.906
<i>-And, as we know,</i>
<i>Mr. Lampson lost the seat</i>

23:33.939 --> 23:36.408
<i>after redistricting.</i>
<i>So, what issues?</i>

23:36.442 --> 23:39.311
-Shit, shit. Shit!
<i>-It remains</i>
<i>a Republican-leaning district.</i>

23:39.345 --> 23:41.113
Yes! Holy shit!
<i>-But it has become</i>

23:41.147 --> 23:42.915
<i>eminently more winnable</i>

23:42.948 --> 23:45.084
<i>-for him.</i>
-Okay, so Tom DeLay dropped out

23:45.117 --> 23:47.153
and they couldn't nominate
another Republican.

23:47.186 --> 23:48.821
A Democrat won.

23:48.854 --> 23:50.422
That's really what happened.

23:50.456 --> 23:52.858
So, if a candidate is nominated
in the primary

23:52.892 --> 23:54.960
and then drops their nomination,

23:54.994 --> 23:58.097
that candidate's side
can't nominate a new candidate

23:58.130 --> 23:59.865
and the other side
pretty much automatically wins.

23:59.899 --> 24:02.001
So, if I want to beat Brent,
I just have to

24:02.034 --> 24:03.769
get a Republican to beat him
and then drop out.

24:23.022 --> 24:26.225
-♪ Ooh ooh

24:26.258 --> 24:29.962
-♪ Oh oh

24:29.995 --> 24:32.198
-I beat Brent
in the Republican primary,

24:32.231 --> 24:33.299
I drop out,

24:33.332 --> 24:34.867
Sally wins.

24:34.900 --> 24:37.203
Holy shit.
-♪ Oh oh oh

24:37.236 --> 24:38.837
-Holy shit.

24:38.871 --> 24:40.005
Okay.

24:42.241 --> 24:43.409
Oh, my God, what?

24:43.442 --> 24:45.344
How do I have nothing --

24:57.456 --> 24:59.925
Okay, I'll never tell
a real lie.

24:59.959 --> 25:02.294
As long as I don't lie,
it's fine.

25:02.328 --> 25:04.363
My platform will be...

25:04.396 --> 25:06.265
Hi, I'm Dorothy Goodwin.
If you have some time

25:06.298 --> 25:07.533

25:07.566 --> 25:09.034
Some people say
illegalize tobacco,

25:09.068 --> 25:10.903
but I say legalize everything.

25:10.936 --> 25:13.239
-Who says illegalize tobacco?

25:15.541 --> 25:17.876
-I'm a Democrat.

25:17.910 --> 25:19.979
-I am --
-Honestly, I'm registered

25:20.012 --> 25:21.780

-Do you think your mom

25:21.814 --> 25:23.015

-No, she would not.

25:34.526 --> 25:36.428
Jesus.

25:36.462 --> 25:37.329
Are you --

26:22.141 --> 26:24.176
-They put that up
a few years ago.

26:24.209 --> 26:25.511
I tried to find you on Facebook,

26:25.544 --> 26:28.580
but you're actually
really hard to find.

26:28.614 --> 26:30.215
Hey, do you have five minutes?

26:33.652 --> 26:35.321
There's something that
I really want to show you.

26:38.290 --> 26:39.992
-I really -- I just need to

26:40.025 --> 26:41.860
get back out there and --
-No. No, no, no, just give me

26:41.894 --> 26:43.962
a second, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Um,

26:43.996 --> 26:45.998
I swear I'm like --
I'm actually losing my mind.

26:46.031 --> 26:48.100
I just had these and I think
Cheryl moved them again

26:48.133 --> 26:49.301
and I'm like,
"Where did you put these?

26:49.335 --> 26:52.137
Stop moving stuff everywhere."

26:52.171 --> 26:54.006
Aah!
What are you looking at?

26:54.039 --> 26:57.009
-Oh, nothing, just --
-Oh, look at you!

26:57.042 --> 26:59.144
Oh, my gosh, you're --
you were so cute.

26:59.178 --> 27:01.046
You were like all
about Alexander Hamilton

27:01.080 --> 27:03.082
before anyone else was.

27:03.115 --> 27:04.917
-Yep.
We were all wrong.

27:04.950 --> 27:06.385
He was actually
a complete hypocrite.

27:06.418 --> 27:08.153
-I found them!

27:08.187 --> 27:10.122
Yes! Oh!

27:10.155 --> 27:12.358
So, we had to recatalog
everything recently

27:12.391 --> 27:15.227
and I came across this
and I got such a kick out of it.

27:15.260 --> 27:16.528
It brought all the memories back

27:16.562 --> 27:19.598
and I was like,
"I have to show Dorothy!"

27:19.631 --> 27:21.500
"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz"
was the last play you did,

27:21.533 --> 27:22.935
right, in school?

27:22.968 --> 27:24.169
-Yeah.

27:24.203 --> 27:26.271
-Oh, I'm so excited
to show you this!

27:26.305 --> 27:28.240
Some of these are so cute!

27:31.110 --> 27:32.978
Look!

27:33.011 --> 27:35.047
Sit.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.615
-Okay.
-Look at this!

27:36.648 --> 27:37.983
Look at you.

27:38.016 --> 27:40.152
-There I am.
-Oh, my gosh.

27:40.185 --> 27:41.620
Oh, we had so much fun.

27:41.653 --> 27:43.055
Aww, I was so jealous

27:43.088 --> 27:44.623
that you were the Wicked Witch.

27:44.656 --> 27:46.125
-Ugh!
-I was. I hated playing Dorothy.

27:46.158 --> 27:47.526
She was so boring.

27:47.559 --> 27:48.961
She just kind of walked around
with this like

27:48.994 --> 27:50.662
stunned look
on her face, you know?

27:50.696 --> 27:52.664
-You were really good at it, so.

27:52.698 --> 27:54.967
-Are you being sarcastic?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.368
-No, I was honestly being
sincere. I mean,

27:56.402 --> 27:57.603
you were the lead every year,
so you were

27:57.636 --> 27:59.138
very good at playing ingenues.

27:59.171 --> 28:00.506
-Why did you quit the musicals?

28:00.539 --> 28:02.207
You were so good.
-Thanks.

28:02.241 --> 28:05.043
-Your dad -- Oh, my gosh.

28:05.077 --> 28:07.379
Look, he looks so happy.

28:07.413 --> 28:10.082
-Mm-hmm. He looks really happy.
-I noticed that y'all

28:10.115 --> 28:11.483
don't have that many photos
of him in the house,

28:11.517 --> 28:13.018
so I want you to have this.

28:13.051 --> 28:14.420
-Um, no, I don't --
I'm good, thank you.

28:14.453 --> 28:16.155
-Come on, it's fine.
I won't get in trouble.

28:16.188 --> 28:17.689
Don't worry about it.
-Okay, I don't really want it.

28:17.723 --> 28:19.258
-There are so many photos of him
in there and you can --

28:19.291 --> 28:20.659
you can cut them out.
Put it in your backpack.

28:20.692 --> 28:22.327
-Okay, I really appreciate it.

28:22.361 --> 28:24.096
Thank you so much. I just --
I'm going to be home

28:24.129 --> 28:25.330
for a little while
and it would really help me if,

28:25.364 --> 28:26.698
every single time
we saw each other,

28:26.733 --> 28:29.001
you didn't bring up my dad
because it just

28:29.034 --> 28:31.103
makes it really hard for me to,
you know.

28:31.136 --> 28:32.704
-Yeah.
Well, I'm so sorry.

28:32.739 --> 28:34.306
-No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-I just thought you might want

28:34.339 --> 28:35.607
to have that and then --
That was

28:35.641 --> 28:37.042
completely insensitive of me.

28:37.075 --> 28:38.544
-It's fine, it's fine,
thank you.

28:38.577 --> 28:39.678
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:39.711 --> 28:42.581
It's a very nice gesture and --

28:42.614 --> 28:44.249
I'm just hot, you know?

28:44.283 --> 28:46.318
And I've just been walking
around all day and I'm --

28:46.351 --> 28:47.553
I'm sorry.
-Sometimes I come on

28:47.586 --> 28:50.255
a little strong.

28:50.289 --> 28:51.657
It's nothing. It's nothing.

-Ripping it down,

29:32.197 --> 29:33.599
so that they can put up
a Ford dealership

29:33.632 --> 29:35.300
that his daddy wants him to run.

29:35.334 --> 29:37.469
-That's why the franchise
deregulation.

29:37.503 --> 29:39.338
Of course.
Jesus.

29:39.371 --> 29:41.206
That's not even capitalism.
That's oligarchy.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.141
-They say that they're going
to build a new one

29:43.175 --> 29:45.344
and it's going to be super
state-of-the-art and modern

29:45.377 --> 29:47.079
and beautiful
and so it's just whatever.

29:47.112 --> 29:48.580
-They're not going to build
a new community center.

29:48.614 --> 29:50.315
They have no incentive
to do that. They don't think

29:50.349 --> 29:51.751
about anybody but themselves.
That's how this works.

29:51.784 --> 29:53.485
They just don't care
about anybody else.

29:53.519 --> 29:54.686
And what do you mean, whatever?
There's an election

29:54.720 --> 29:55.687
coming up.
There's actually a chance

29:55.721 --> 29:57.222
to do something about this.

29:57.256 --> 29:58.524
-Yeah.
-How do you know all this?

29:58.557 --> 29:59.625
-Because my friend Marcie works

29:59.658 --> 30:01.093
at the county permitting office

30:01.126 --> 30:03.328
and she's a real gossip.

30:07.266 --> 30:08.133
-Well.

30:10.602 --> 30:11.603
Thanks for the photos.

30:11.637 --> 30:14.106
I'm sorry for getting heated.

30:14.139 --> 30:16.174
So we'll see you

30:16.208 --> 30:17.409
Sunday for dinner?

30:17.442 --> 30:19.846
Is that like a weekly thing,
or...?

30:19.879 --> 30:21.413
-You wouldn't change this place?

30:23.181 --> 30:25.551
-I mean, I think it could use
new carpeting

30:25.584 --> 30:27.252
and a fresh coat of paint,
but I definitely wouldn't

30:27.286 --> 30:29.388
turn it into a Ford dealership.

30:29.421 --> 30:32.724
-Don't hate me for suggesting
this, but I have an idea.

30:32.759 --> 30:35.627
Do you happen to own anything
that's a little bit more...

30:35.661 --> 30:36.662
feminine?

30:41.433 --> 30:43.268
- Feminine, feminine,

30:43.302 --> 30:44.303
feminine, feminine.

30:44.336 --> 30:46.572
Feminine, feminine, feminine.

30:58.483 --> 31:00.152
Feminine.

31:00.185 --> 31:01.821
- Smile.

31:01.854 --> 31:03.188
Hi, Kelsey!

31:03.221 --> 31:05.724
Hey, Elsa.
How y'all doing?

31:05.758 --> 31:06.759
Hi, ladies.

31:35.654 --> 31:38.290
-I'm so sorry.

31:38.323 --> 31:40.359
Genie just said --
-That I don't know anyone

31:40.392 --> 31:42.628
and it made no sense.
<i>-Okay, to be fair,</i>

31:42.661 --> 31:45.530
<i>it sounds like you asked</i>
<i>for help and she tried.</i>

31:45.564 --> 31:47.332
-Oh, hell no.
I'm sorry, that dumb bitch

31:47.366 --> 31:48.700
has been a dumb bitch
since elementary school.

31:48.735 --> 31:49.701
She fucking set me up.

31:49.736 --> 31:51.303
We were friends in middle school

31:51.336 --> 31:52.772
and she's done this before!

31:52.805 --> 31:54.272
She's probably over there
laughing about it

31:54.306 --> 31:55.340
over fucking sweet tea
right now,

31:55.374 --> 31:56.708
or whatever the hell they drink.

31:56.743 --> 31:59.478
<i>-Adults don't do that.</i>
-Adults fucking

31:59.511 --> 32:01.346
drive drunk and watch MMA.

32:01.380 --> 32:02.714
Don't tell me what adults do.

32:02.749 --> 32:04.516
<i>-Well, you FaceTime</i>
<i>while driving.</i>

32:04.549 --> 32:06.685
-You're in the cradle.
<i> -You split from that small town</i>

32:06.718 --> 32:09.388
<i>like over a decade ago</i>
and <i>you're not Republican.</i>

32:09.421 --> 32:10.757
<i>I think it's fair to suggest</i>

32:10.790 --> 32:13.659
<i>that you're</i>
<i>an unlikely candidate.</i>

32:13.692 --> 32:15.928
-Okay, I'd just like to say
that I think, at this point,

32:15.962 --> 32:17.396
we've kind of jumped the shark

32:17.429 --> 32:18.664
on the whole
likely candidate thing.

32:18.697 --> 32:20.232
Our president's literally
the laughingstock

32:20.265 --> 32:20.933
of mainstream media.

32:20.967 --> 32:22.534
It's why he's famous.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.202
<i>-Mark my words --</i>
<i>a KarJenner may be</i>

32:24.236 --> 32:25.671
<i>in the White House</i>
<i>in the next three terms.</i>

32:25.704 --> 32:27.840
<i>Please, God, Kim, not Kanye.</i>

32:27.874 --> 32:29.474
-I'm sorry,
that is actually insane.

32:29.508 --> 32:30.642
The solution to a reality star
is not

32:30.676 --> 32:31.944
another fucking reality star.

32:31.978 --> 32:33.412
That is so insane,
it's actually absurdist,

32:33.445 --> 32:34.847
and absurdism
makes me wants to die.

32:34.881 --> 32:36.615
"Waiting for Godot"
is my least favorite play.

32:36.648 --> 32:38.550
I promised myself that,
if it ever got to this place

32:38.583 --> 32:40.485
in this country, I would move
and go to the Peace Corps.

32:40.519 --> 32:41.988
But honestly, at this point,
Texas seems like

32:42.021 --> 32:43.588
it needs the Peace Corps more
than anyplace else,

32:43.622 --> 32:45.290
so I don't even know what
to fucking do anymore.

32:45.323 --> 32:46.959
<i>-What you're talking about is</i>
<i>AmeriCorps.</i>

32:46.993 --> 32:48.560
<i>Someone's behind you,</i>
<i>trying to get in the freezer.</i>

32:48.593 --> 32:49.695
-I don't give a shit.
They can fucking wait.

32:50.963 --> 32:52.664
Do not touch me!
<i>-Is that a gun?</i>

32:52.698 --> 32:53.966
<i>Dorothy, it's a gun!</i>

32:54.000 --> 32:57.369
<i>Aaaaaaah!</i>
-Aaaaaaah!

32:57.402 --> 32:58.905
- Stop! Run!

32:58.938 --> 33:00.639
-Aaaaah!

33:00.672 --> 33:01.908
What the hell type of people

33:01.941 --> 33:03.976
try to rob a pregnant woman?

33:04.010 --> 33:05.510
-Do you know
what day it is today?

33:05.544 --> 33:06.478
-Happy.

33:06.511 --> 33:08.447
Hap--

33:08.480 --> 33:10.649
I don't remember.

33:10.682 --> 33:11.984
Um, it's a weekday.

33:12.018 --> 33:13.953
-Okay.
-Um, I was just --

33:13.986 --> 33:15.988
I was visiting home, so I just
don't remember generally.

33:16.022 --> 33:17.689
It's not like I don't remember
'cause I'm in shock.

33:17.723 --> 33:19.926
I just -- I'm -- I just am

33:19.959 --> 33:22.360
between jobs right now
and I was on my way

33:22.394 --> 33:23.930
to get it down today.

33:23.963 --> 33:26.331
Um, is everyone else okay?

33:26.364 --> 33:28.000
Everyone's fine, ma'am.

33:28.034 --> 33:30.435
-Do you know who the president
of the United States is?

33:31.670 --> 33:33.740
4, 3, 2, 1.

33:33.773 --> 33:35.507
Hello, I'm Victoria Upson

33:35.540 --> 33:36.809
<i>on location in Alabaster,</i>

33:36.843 --> 33:39.879

<i>for PJTX at Noon.</i>

33:39.912 --> 33:42.447
<i>In breaking news,</i>
<i>we are at the Kwik and Serv</i>

33:42.481 --> 33:44.016
<i>with Dorothy Goodwin,</i>

33:44.050 --> 33:46.919
<i>who is being hailed</i>
<i>as a hero today!</i>

33:46.953 --> 33:49.856
<i>Witnesses are saying that she</i>
<i>saved 12 people's lives,</i>

33:49.889 --> 33:53.558
<i>including that of pregnant</i>
<i>owner Eloise Fincher herself,</i>

33:53.592 --> 33:56.896
<i>by disarming two masked gunmen</i>

33:56.929 --> 33:58.563
<i>Dorothy.</i>
<i>-Oh.</i>

33:58.597 --> 34:00.298
<i>-Ma'am, ma'am,</i>
<i>you can't be in the truck.</i>

34:00.332 --> 34:01.633
<i>-Dorothy, what is the last</i>
<i>thing you remember</i>

34:01.666 --> 34:03.069
<i>before you took the guns?</i>

34:03.102 --> 34:04.937
-Um, I --

34:04.971 --> 34:07.305
-Hi, Mae-bird.
<i>-And I was trying to get</i>

34:07.339 --> 34:09.440
<i>a coconut water and then...</i>
-What y'all watching?

34:09.474 --> 34:10.976
<i>when it went off, it --</i>
<i>I hurt my hand.</i>

34:11.010 --> 34:13.780
<i>-People are calling</i>
<i>your actions heroic.</i>

34:13.813 --> 34:16.313
-Oh, my good.
<i>-Do you agree?</i>
<i>-I just did</i>

34:16.348 --> 34:17.516
<i>what any good person would do</i>
-Lord.

34:17.549 --> 34:18.851
<i>-and I -- I just did</i>

34:18.885 --> 34:20.452
<i>the best I could</i>
<i>to stop the attack!</i>

34:20.485 --> 34:21.821
-Spoken like a mother

34:21.853 --> 34:25.024
who just lifted the car
off her two kids.

34:25.056 --> 34:27.659
True courage
was shown here today.

34:27.692 --> 34:29.527
A true hometown hero.

34:29.561 --> 34:30.830
<i>-Um, hi.</i>

34:30.862 --> 34:33.632
<i>Uh, I -- Um, yes.</i>

34:33.665 --> 34:35.835
<i>Um, if I have courage,</i>
<i>it's the same courage</i>

34:35.868 --> 34:38.637
<i>I hope to bring to my campaign</i>
<i>for state legislature.</i>

34:38.670 --> 34:40.371
-Oh, my -- Hey, Carla...
<i>-Dorothy Goodwin</i>

34:40.405 --> 34:41.808
-I-I-I got to go. Do you mind --
<i>-for state legislature.</i>

34:41.841 --> 34:43.440
<i>We'll be back in a few moments</i>
-Thank you.

34:43.475 --> 34:44.708
<i>with the convenience</i>
-I love you. I'll be back

34:44.744 --> 34:45.610
<i>-store hero.</i>
-in a couple hours.

34:45.643 --> 34:46.779
I love you, Mae!

34:47.847 --> 34:48.880
<i>-You heard it here first.</i>

34:56.388 --> 34:58.925
-Vicky!

34:58.958 --> 35:00.092
Hey!

35:00.126 --> 35:01.459
Are you okay?
-Did you see it?

35:01.493 --> 35:02.995
-Yes! Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

35:03.029 --> 35:04.362
-Is everyone okay?
-Yeah, she just --

35:04.396 --> 35:05.597
she hurt her hand.
-Oh, my God!

35:05.630 --> 35:07.133
How the hell did you get here
so fast?

35:07.166 --> 35:09.568
-I made Jeremy get me
a police radio for the van.

35:09.601 --> 35:11.603
If this doesn't get me
the Sunday morning spot --

35:12.872 --> 35:13.906
-Jeremy?

35:13.940 --> 35:14.841
Pick it up.
I love you.

35:14.874 --> 35:15.775
I'm glad you're okay.

35:18.144 --> 35:18.978
-Hi!

35:19.011 --> 35:21.147
-Dorothy!
Hey!

35:21.180 --> 35:23.783
-No, Geraldine
cannot have gluten.

35:23.816 --> 35:25.151
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, what are you doing here?

35:25.184 --> 35:26.986
-Oh, girl, I feel so bad
about this morning.

35:27.019 --> 35:28.955
I'm so sorry about that.
I've really been, like,

35:28.988 --> 35:30.823
feeling sick about it all day.
-It's really fine.

35:30.857 --> 35:32.424
Is that Vicky from high school?

35:32.457 --> 35:34.126
You guys are friends?
-Yes, she's my godsister.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.694
-Of course, you know everyone.
Is --

35:35.728 --> 35:36.996
Did you hear anything
over there about --

35:37.029 --> 35:38.430
Is she --
She just seems really upset.

35:38.463 --> 35:39.832
Is it anything about my --
-What?

35:39.866 --> 35:41.433
No, no, no, she's going through
a messy divorce.

35:41.466 --> 35:42.601
It's totally fine.
-Okay, sorry.

35:42.634 --> 35:44.436
-Yeah, it's fine.
I have an idea.

35:44.469 --> 35:45.738
I've been thinking
about it all morning.

35:45.771 --> 35:47.439
Oh, my God, by the way,
I saw you on TV!

35:47.472 --> 35:49.742
It was so badass!
It was like the coolest thing.

35:49.775 --> 35:51.010
-Thanks.
-Are you okay?

35:51.043 --> 35:52.778
Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm really fine.

35:52.812 --> 35:54.412
I'm really, really fine.

35:54.446 --> 35:55.915
-Okay, because I've been
thinking I would vote you,

35:55.948 --> 35:57.716
and I really think a lot
of people in this town would,

35:57.750 --> 35:58.818
and I --
-Look, I really appreciate that.

35:58.851 --> 36:00.518
Thank you so much
for the support.

36:00.552 --> 36:02.088
It's just -- you know,
you really don't owe me anything

36:02.121 --> 36:03.823
just 'cause we were friends
in middle school, and I --

36:03.856 --> 36:05.157
I'm sorry, I know
that sounds snarky.

36:05.191 --> 36:06.826
I'm just in a rush to get back
on camera,

36:06.859 --> 36:08.194
but, really, you just don't,
and that's totally fine.

36:08.227 --> 36:09.661
But just, you know --
-But I have an idea.

36:09.694 --> 36:10.695
-Unless Genie's
gonna endorse me --

36:10.730 --> 36:11.931
She's endorsing Brent,

36:11.964 --> 36:13.565
I don't know
why that's happening.

36:13.598 --> 36:15.201
-Try to listen, okay?
Because I have an idea.

36:15.234 --> 36:18.070
-Okay.
-You're a gun hero now.

36:18.104 --> 36:19.671
-Mm-hmm.

36:19.704 --> 36:22.909
-You're an implicit
spokeswoman.

36:22.942 --> 36:24.542
-What, like I sell guns?

36:24.576 --> 36:27.079
-You go to her events,
you pose for photos.

36:27.113 --> 36:28.647
Vicky's over there.

36:28.680 --> 36:31.683
She's calling you
the Convenience Store Hero.

36:31.716 --> 36:33.185
You match that with all
the other things

36:33.219 --> 36:36.554
you're saying, and, girl...

36:36.588 --> 36:38.456
you've got a tagline.

36:38.490 --> 36:40.592
-What, like -- like -- like,

36:40.625 --> 36:43.129
"Being a hero is having courage
even when it isn't convenient?"

36:43.162 --> 36:44.830
-I'm literally obsessed with --

36:44.864 --> 36:46.165
Like, I don't know
how you just came up with that.

36:46.198 --> 36:48.034
-It's literally the most
basic-bitch tagline

36:48.067 --> 36:49.668
in the history of politics.
-It's perfect.

36:49.701 --> 36:51.003
People are very simple.

36:52.838 --> 36:54.907
-You really think that's good?
-I think it's really good.

36:54.941 --> 36:56.776
I wouldn't lie.

36:56.809 --> 37:00.746
I really don't want to lose
my job at the community center.

37:00.780 --> 37:04.984
Do you want to beat Brent?

37:05.017 --> 37:06.018
-Yeah, I want to beat Brent.

37:06.052 --> 37:07.753
-Can you let me try my idea?

37:10.022 --> 37:12.892
Vicky!

37:12.925 --> 37:15.627
-Holy shit.

37:15.660 --> 37:21.167
-Hey, I was just thinking.
Um...

37:21.200 --> 37:22.935
I was over there
talking to Dorothy,

37:22.969 --> 37:24.703
and you know how when we were --

37:24.737 --> 37:26.671
we were hanging out last week,
and we were at Chili's,

37:26.705 --> 37:29.541
and you were saying
that you wanted to do, you know,

37:29.574 --> 37:31.243
more of a journalistic piece?
-Yeah.

37:31.277 --> 37:34.847
-I was just like, "Oh, my gosh.
I have this crazy good idea."

37:34.880 --> 37:36.514
You know, we already
got all this,

37:36.548 --> 37:38.217
and if we're outta here
in the next 30 seconds,

37:38.250 --> 37:39.684
you'll be the only one --
-What are you talking about?

37:39.718 --> 37:41.153
What?
-You'll be the only one.

37:41.187 --> 37:43.089
-Like -- Like, an exclusive?
-Yes, like an exclusive.

37:43.122 --> 37:45.958
-An exclusive?
-Yeah.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.762
-Good evening.

37:49.795 --> 37:54.033
I'm Victoria Upson
for PJTX Houston 5:00 news.

37:54.066 --> 37:57.136
We're coming to you live from
the Alabaster Community Center

37:57.169 --> 37:59.739
with Dorothy Goodwin.

37:59.772 --> 38:02.942
And on a personal note, you're
seeing the stage behind us,

38:02.975 --> 38:05.277
where her late father,
Teddy Goodwin,

38:05.311 --> 38:08.713
used to teach many of
the children in this community.

38:08.748 --> 38:11.183
Following the saving
of 12 lives today,

38:11.217 --> 38:14.887
you are being called
the Convenience Store Hero.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.924
When you were looking down the
barrel of not one but two guns,

38:18.958 --> 38:20.326
did you feel like a hero?

38:20.359 --> 38:21.894
-First of all,
I just want to say

38:21.927 --> 38:24.096
that I don't want to call
any of my actions heroic

38:24.130 --> 38:25.297
because I don't want
to encourage

38:25.331 --> 38:28.300
anyone to repeat my actions.
I was...

38:28.334 --> 38:30.269
If I'm being fully honest,
I just kind of --

38:30.302 --> 38:31.771
my body went numb and --
and --

38:31.804 --> 38:33.671
and took over.
Um...

38:33.705 --> 38:36.608
-Well, I assume you're talking
of the colorful moves

38:36.641 --> 38:38.676
that you used
to disarm those men.

38:38.710 --> 38:40.146
-Yes.

38:40.179 --> 38:42.081
Uh, I was on color guard here
at Alabaster High.

38:42.114 --> 38:43.883
-Because you grew up
in Alabaster.

38:43.916 --> 38:45.650
-Yes.

38:45.683 --> 38:47.053
-Well, it was very lucky
for pregnant

38:47.086 --> 38:48.754
Kwik Serv owner Eloise Fincher

38:48.788 --> 38:50.990
that you were back
in town today.

38:51.023 --> 38:53.625
We spoke with Eloise earlier.

38:53.658 --> 38:55.693
-She is a true hero, you know.

38:55.728 --> 39:01.633
Jesus passed through her,
and...she saved me.

39:01.666 --> 39:03.002
So I am gratef--

39:03.035 --> 39:04.837
-Ooh, a brutal tackle
from Jackson.

39:04.870 --> 39:06.704
-No, it's the cornerstone
of the Republican Party,

39:06.739 --> 39:08.207
is personal liberties.

39:08.240 --> 39:11.077
-Brent Hart -- He's also called
a hometown hero.

39:11.110 --> 39:12.978
Yale graduate.
-He is.

39:13.012 --> 39:17.316
Uh, yes, I think that I would
invite anyone who feels

39:17.349 --> 39:20.786
that Brent is a hometown hero
to look at his plans

39:20.820 --> 39:23.789
to outbid
this very community center

39:23.823 --> 39:27.093
when it is up
for renewal this year

39:27.126 --> 39:30.695
and put in a Ford dealership
right here in downtown instead.

39:30.729 --> 39:32.798
We all lose when
corporate America

39:32.832 --> 39:34.300
is allowed to
buy out Main Street.

39:34.333 --> 39:37.336
-Dad, you gotta close
the fridge in between times.

39:37.369 --> 39:40.372
-It's my house.
I'll close it when I want to.

39:40.406 --> 39:42.374
-Is there anything else
that you would like to say

39:42.408 --> 39:45.710
to Alabaster or to the world?
Because they're listening.

39:45.744 --> 39:47.213
-I heard the AR-15
wasn't even loaded.

39:47.246 --> 39:48.646
Come on, turn that off.
Let's go eat.

39:48.680 --> 39:49.915
-You know her -- that's Dorothy.
-Yeah.

39:49.949 --> 39:51.951
-That's Mr. Goodwin's daughter.

39:51.984 --> 39:55.354
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
the theater guy.

39:55.387 --> 39:58.224
-Yeah. Well, he taught me
public speaking and diction.

39:58.257 --> 39:59.825
He was a pretty good guy.

39:59.859 --> 40:01.726
She ran against me
every year and lost.

40:01.760 --> 40:03.195
You remember that?

40:03.229 --> 40:04.662
Lost every time.

40:04.696 --> 40:05.931
-The franchises
are gonna come here,

40:05.965 --> 40:07.833
no matter if it's us
or someone else.

40:07.867 --> 40:11.337
If it ain't us, it's gonna be
goddamn Chevy GMC.

40:11.370 --> 40:13.038
-Yeah.

40:13.072 --> 40:14.740
-I'm gonna give you a number
to call for insurance.

40:14.773 --> 40:17.276
Everyone's hiding something.

40:17.309 --> 40:20.446
We got this two-shit
stepping our necks.

40:20.479 --> 40:22.081
-Boys, come on and eat.

40:22.114 --> 40:23.415
The chicken's getting cold.
-Alright, come on.

40:23.449 --> 40:25.184
Turn that off, let's go eat.

40:25.217 --> 40:26.852
And water your mother's plants,
will ya?

40:26.886 --> 40:28.354
-I will.

40:32.324 --> 40:35.161
-That I would take any amount
of pain and any amount of danger

40:35.194 --> 40:36.896
far exceeding
what happened today

40:36.929 --> 40:39.131
in order to get this community
and this country back

40:39.165 --> 40:42.334
on the path to the America
that I was promised as a youth.

40:42.368 --> 40:45.304
And real heroism
is having courage

40:45.337 --> 40:47.672
even when it isn't convenient.

40:49.942 --> 40:53.879
-Whoo!
Station loved it.

40:53.913 --> 40:55.948
-R-Really?
I didn't seem, like, too angry

40:55.981 --> 40:58.184
and, like, I was just
rambling the entire time?

40:58.217 --> 40:59.852
-No.
I hope you win.

40:59.885 --> 41:01.153
-It was so powerful,
I got goose bumps.

41:01.187 --> 41:02.788
-Really?
Are you sure?

41:02.821 --> 41:04.223
Because I felt very stupid
saying it yet again.

41:04.256 --> 41:05.291
-100%. No, you have to put
that in your literature.

41:05.324 --> 41:07.927
You really do.

41:07.960 --> 41:09.461
-You know, honestly, I think...

41:11.197 --> 41:14.400
I know that I'm...

41:14.433 --> 41:16.435
whatever, but I have had

41:16.468 --> 41:18.237
a lot of experience
on political campaigns.

41:18.270 --> 41:19.838
I don't know if you know this,
but I actually dropped out

41:19.872 --> 41:22.174
of college after my dad died,
and --

41:22.208 --> 41:24.410
-I didn't know that.
-Uh, yeah, and went on

41:24.443 --> 41:26.412
a political campaign
and volunteered

41:26.445 --> 41:28.347
and have just been working in
political campaigns ever since.

41:28.380 --> 41:29.481
I went to --
-Yeah, you can tell you know

41:29.515 --> 41:30.883
what you're doing.

41:30.916 --> 41:32.251
-And I do think that
with what I know

41:32.284 --> 41:35.254
and who you know,
maybe we would know enough.

41:35.287 --> 41:38.524
-What do you mean
with who I know?

41:38.557 --> 41:41.393
-You know, like...

41:41.427 --> 41:42.962
like, if I ran and --

41:42.995 --> 41:44.430
and you talked to the Vickys
of the world,

41:44.463 --> 41:45.998
but every day
instead of just today.

41:46.031 --> 41:48.100
-Wait. You want me
to be involved?

41:48.133 --> 41:50.135
-I don't -- I mean, not to --
It wouldn't be a ton of work.

41:50.169 --> 41:51.437
I could do -- I could do
all the legwork

41:51.470 --> 41:52.905
for both of us, and --
and I could --

41:52.938 --> 41:54.206
I could organize everything,

41:54.240 --> 41:55.374
and all you would really
have to do is like

41:55.407 --> 41:58.510
show up and smile or...

41:58.544 --> 42:02.014
make a phone call
here and there for me.

42:02.047 --> 42:05.851
I feel like we have
some values in common,

42:05.884 --> 42:08.954
and I think we both
want to beat Brent.

42:08.988 --> 42:11.023
-So I'd be like
your campaign manager?

42:13.926 --> 42:16.295
-Yeah.

42:16.328 --> 42:17.529
Why not?
-Okay.

42:17.563 --> 42:18.831
-Sure, you're
my campaign manager.

42:18.864 --> 42:20.866
-I'll do it.

42:20.899 --> 42:22.067
-Really?
-Yeah.

42:22.101 --> 42:25.137
That sounds --

42:25.170 --> 42:28.240
I want --
Yes, I want to do it.

42:28.274 --> 42:29.141
I believe in you.

42:29.174 --> 42:31.277
Honestly, I'm excited.

42:31.310 --> 42:33.946
-I can't pay you.
-That's okay.

42:33.979 --> 42:35.414
Let's go out.
I have a babysitter.

42:35.447 --> 42:36.982
She'll stay for the next
hour and a half.

42:37.016 --> 42:38.917
Please, can we, please,
please go out?

42:38.951 --> 42:40.853
I want to celebrate.
We also have things to do.

42:40.886 --> 42:42.554
Do you want to get a drink?

42:42.588 --> 42:44.290
-I don't really drink.

42:44.323 --> 42:50.062
-Should we go to Chili's?
-Sure.

42:52.931 --> 42:54.166
I don't usually eat
at chain restaurants

42:54.199 --> 42:56.068
because their shipping practices

42:56.101 --> 42:57.436
are really problematic
for the environment.

42:57.469 --> 42:59.104
-"I don't usually eat
at chain restaurants

42:59.138 --> 43:00.939
'cause their shipping
practices are really" --

43:00.973 --> 43:03.542
What did you just say?

43:08.280 --> 43:09.548
-Hello, America.
I'm Mark Levin.

43:09.581 --> 43:11.317
This is "Life, Liberty & Levin."

43:11.350 --> 43:14.186
A big-time special edition.

43:14.219 --> 43:17.456
The Democrats up Schiff's creek.

43:17.489 --> 43:20.559
Now, before we start,
I noticed all the witnesses --

43:20.592 --> 43:23.062
and even the witnesses
who aren't witnesses --

43:23.095 --> 43:25.931
have to prove to you
that they're noble, courageous,

43:25.964 --> 43:27.399
and beyond reproach.

43:27.433 --> 43:29.201
<i>The New York Times</i>
likes to refer to me as...

43:54.993 --> 43:57.996
-It's not cute
to watch me sleep.

44:00.432 --> 44:03.602
-You were gonna spill that beer.

44:03.635 --> 44:06.105
I'm sorry I, uh, missed dinner
and Greta missed dinner.

44:06.138 --> 44:07.473
She was helping me
with something.

44:07.506 --> 44:15.481
-I saw on TV that you got
into Lois's clothes.

44:17.683 --> 44:19.351
-Oh. Yeah.
Um, I'm sorry.

44:19.385 --> 44:20.552
You weren't supposed
to see that.

44:20.586 --> 44:22.020
I -- I have it here.

44:22.054 --> 44:24.423
It's not damaged or anything.

44:24.456 --> 44:26.191
I'll put it back in the cellar.

44:26.225 --> 44:27.659
-Let me ask you a question.

44:27.693 --> 44:31.497
Maybe I don't know.
Are you running for office?

44:31.530 --> 44:33.031
Yeah, I am.

44:33.065 --> 44:34.099
I'm running for office.

44:34.133 --> 44:35.534
-For what?

44:35.567 --> 44:37.503
-I'm running for
state legislature.

44:37.536 --> 44:40.439
-Well, it's not a good image
to have yourself in that outfit

44:40.472 --> 44:43.242
that you had on, on the TV.

44:43.275 --> 44:46.078
And the next time,
if you would ask me,

44:46.111 --> 44:48.947
I could show you other stuff
you haven't seen yet.

44:48.981 --> 44:54.052
There's other boxes, where Lois
had really cool stuff.

44:54.086 --> 44:57.055
You were looking
at her mother's stuff.

44:59.458 --> 45:00.726
-Um, okay.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.661
Maybe in the morning?
-Yeah.

45:02.694 --> 45:04.530
I'll show you some other stuff
in the morning.

45:04.563 --> 45:06.098
-Thanks.

45:06.131 --> 45:07.666
-Where were the Democrats?

45:07.699 --> 45:09.601
Where were the impeachment
hearings then?

45:34.693 --> 45:36.495
-No?

45:36.528 --> 45:38.330
Okay, then let's go over it
because I don't want to be --

45:38.363 --> 45:41.768
I don't want to be bad drama
dad, as I'm sure people call me.

45:41.801 --> 45:43.435
Okay.
So, you had social studies.

45:43.469 --> 45:45.103
Do you have anything
from social studies?

45:45.137 --> 45:47.372
You remember what Miss --
-Oh, yeah.

45:47.406 --> 45:49.007
Okay.

45:49.041 --> 45:50.542
♪ What do you have
for homework today? ♪

45:50.576 --> 45:52.745
What do you have?

45:52.779 --> 45:55.314
-Um, I...

45:55.347 --> 45:58.450
I forgot to write it down.

45:58.484 --> 45:59.718
-Um --
-You know what?

45:59.752 --> 46:01.186
You know what'll
jog your memory?

46:01.220 --> 46:02.688
Play something for me.

46:07.459 --> 46:10.095
-This is cool.
-Oh, my God.

46:10.128 --> 46:11.196
It's a track suit.

46:11.230 --> 46:13.265
Do you run?
-No.

46:13.298 --> 46:15.033
I mean, I --
No.

46:15.067 --> 46:18.237
-Well, why would you wear it?

46:18.270 --> 46:22.174
-You don't need to run
to use a track suit.

46:29.348 --> 46:30.582
-No, no, no, no.

46:30.616 --> 46:32.718
That's out.

46:32.752 --> 46:35.153
That's out.
Just put it back.

46:35.187 --> 46:37.089
Yeah.

46:37.122 --> 46:41.260
Maybe one day, but not now.

46:41.293 --> 46:46.298
I never remember how to get up
from this fucking cellar.

46:46.331 --> 46:49.535
And leave the red dress.

46:49.568 --> 46:53.138
You can have one box to start.

46:53.171 --> 46:55.173
And treat it with care.

46:59.478 --> 47:01.179
-I don't need a straw, I'm good.
-Find out the best birds for

47:01.213 --> 47:02.614
your Thanksgiving table later.

47:02.648 --> 47:05.417
But first, next up,
a special report

47:05.450 --> 47:07.519
on yesterday's
armed robbery in down...

47:07.553 --> 47:09.221
-Hey, how you doing?
-Thank you.

47:09.254 --> 47:10.589
-Thank you so much.
-I don't need --

47:10.622 --> 47:11.791
I don't need a straw.
I'm good. Thank you.

47:11.824 --> 47:13.292
-Oh.
Why don't you want a straw?

47:13.325 --> 47:14.794
-I just --
I just don't need --

47:14.827 --> 47:16.628
-Oh, sweetie, your hand.
She's worried about her hand.

47:18.263 --> 47:20.833
Oh.
Thank you, Ariel.

47:20.867 --> 47:23.569
Oh, my gosh, I get so, like,
jittery, you know,

47:23.602 --> 47:26.572
with Genie
because she can just be, like...

47:26.605 --> 47:28.440
so "blech" sometimes.

47:28.473 --> 47:30.208
You know what I mean?
-Mm-hmm.

47:30.242 --> 47:32.711
-I get so antsy, and then,
last night, like, of all nights,

47:32.745 --> 47:34.446
our plumbing breaks.

47:34.479 --> 47:36.315
And then Mae is sitting there
waiting by the phone.

47:36.348 --> 47:37.649
I told you she's been, like,

47:37.683 --> 47:39.418
doing this whole
vow-of-silence thing, right?

47:39.451 --> 47:40.619
-No.
-Yeah.

47:40.652 --> 47:42.354
Ever since Fisher left
last time,

47:42.387 --> 47:44.690
she is protesting the war,
and I'm very proud of her,

47:44.723 --> 47:47.192
but I'm losing my mind,
and I'm...

47:47.225 --> 47:49.194
-Mae will come around.

47:49.227 --> 47:50.863
She's just missing her daddy.

47:50.897 --> 47:52.497
-Hi, Genie.
-We got to get right to it

47:52.531 --> 47:54.399
because I got a budget meeting
in 30 minutes.

47:54.433 --> 47:55.835
-Okay. Gotcha.
Um...

47:55.868 --> 47:58.537
Genie...

47:58.570 --> 48:00.138
Um, did you happen
to see the new--

48:00.172 --> 48:01.239
-I'm going to take it
to go, Ariana.

48:01.273 --> 48:02.608
Thank you.

48:02.641 --> 48:03.743
-Did you happen to see
the news last night?

48:03.776 --> 48:05.177
-I did, yeah.
-Oh, you did?

48:05.210 --> 48:06.244
-I thought you made
some good points.

48:06.278 --> 48:07.479
-She did, right?
-Thank you.

48:07.512 --> 48:09.314
-I know. I thought it was
very impressive.

48:09.348 --> 48:11.751
And you know who else caught it,
uh, was John

48:11.784 --> 48:13.753
over John's Guns and Ammo.

48:13.786 --> 48:16.455
And so he actually happened
to call this morning,

48:16.488 --> 48:19.224
seeing if Dorothy would appear
with some of his new inventory

48:19.257 --> 48:22.427
at a barbecue next week,
which is wild.

48:22.461 --> 48:24.229
The first thing I thought is,
I was like,

48:24.262 --> 48:26.733
"I don't think Genie
would like John

48:26.766 --> 48:31.670
claiming the Alabaster gun hero
as his spokesperson."

48:31.703 --> 48:37.376
So, that's what I had to say
to you today about that.

48:37.409 --> 48:39.779
-I remember your father.

48:39.812 --> 48:41.480
He was a good man.

48:41.513 --> 48:44.884
He was very gentle.
-Mm-hmm.

48:44.917 --> 48:47.820
-Are you even into guns?

48:47.854 --> 48:50.322
-Um, I mean, I'm --
Uh, yeah.

48:50.355 --> 48:52.624
Yeah, I-I mean, I'm a --
I'm a gun hero.

48:52.658 --> 48:55.928
And, um, that's only because
I have a deep familiarity

48:55.962 --> 48:57.830
with guns, obviously,

48:57.864 --> 49:00.332
you know, having grown up doing
color guard and being a Texan.

49:00.365 --> 49:03.669
And I just think that, um, uh...

49:06.705 --> 49:09.809
Look, I mean, honestly --
honestly,

49:09.842 --> 49:11.576
I think there's
a huge referendum coming up

49:11.610 --> 49:13.712
in this country
on guns and gun rights,

49:13.746 --> 49:14.847
and I think
it's really important

49:14.881 --> 49:16.381
to have a real Texan...
-Mm-hmm.

49:16.415 --> 49:17.683
Mm-hmm.
-...who's from Alabaster

49:17.716 --> 49:20.452
who has such strong feelings

49:20.485 --> 49:22.421
about guns
as part of that conversation.

49:22.454 --> 49:23.422
-I've already talked
and called everybody

49:23.455 --> 49:24.824
about Walmart moving in.

49:24.857 --> 49:26.291
-Oh, you have?

49:26.324 --> 49:27.659
-Yeah, and, you know,
if that happened,

49:27.693 --> 49:29.461
Hart would have to,
you know, buy me out.

49:29.494 --> 49:31.831
Everybody needs
that community center.

49:31.864 --> 49:33.598
-I know.

49:33.632 --> 49:36.002
-You'd have to be willing to be
completely exclusive

49:36.035 --> 49:38.537
with Greta's Guns,
with my label.

49:38.570 --> 49:39.806
You couldn't buy
from any other store.

49:39.839 --> 49:41.606
Thank you.

49:41.640 --> 49:43.608
And we'd have to do
publicity together.

49:43.642 --> 49:45.310
-Yes, I was thinking
you and Dorothy

49:45.343 --> 49:46.712
could do a story
for the paper together

49:46.746 --> 49:48.380
'cause I know Jan
at The Register.

49:48.413 --> 49:49.681
Oh, my God.

49:49.715 --> 49:51.583
Y'all, do it at the store.
-Excuse me.

49:51.616 --> 49:53.618
Would you just mind excusing
just one second.

49:53.652 --> 49:55.353
-Your sweet hand.
You better go check on it

49:55.387 --> 49:57.422
'cause you're a true
American hero.

49:57.456 --> 50:00.292
Not all heroes wear capes.

50:00.325 --> 50:02.327
-Um, she seems
awfully skittish to me.

50:02.360 --> 50:03.863
-I know, I know.

50:03.896 --> 50:08.433
I know she's a little different,
Genie, but she's smart,

50:08.467 --> 50:10.268
and she's going
to help our town.

50:10.302 --> 50:11.971
-It's fine.
It's, like, not a lie.

50:12.004 --> 50:13.405
Sometimes people just stand
in front of gun stores.

50:13.438 --> 50:15.607
You're just like walking in.

50:15.640 --> 50:17.877
You're just walking in.

50:17.910 --> 50:19.678
There's a gun store behind you
in some places.

50:19.711 --> 50:22.347
Even in California,
there are gun stores.

50:22.380 --> 50:23.515
Thank you.

50:23.548 --> 50:25.717
-Are you okay?
-It's okay.

50:25.752 --> 50:28.020
-Well, we are going
to endorse you,

50:28.054 --> 50:30.388
but we want you
to do something for us.

50:30.422 --> 50:31.690
-Absolutely.

50:31.723 --> 50:34.392
Um, I'm working on smiling
more, um --

50:34.426 --> 50:36.929
-No, no, no, no.
All that innate intensity

50:36.963 --> 50:38.630
works great in politics.

50:38.663 --> 50:39.966
I'm talking about your style.

50:39.999 --> 50:41.399
-Oh.
-Okay?

50:41.433 --> 50:41.968
Greta, you can
help her with that.

50:42.001 --> 50:43.368
-100%.

50:43.401 --> 50:44.703
-And I don't care
about the cost.

50:44.737 --> 50:46.005
I'll take care of all that.
It's great.

50:46.038 --> 50:47.807
It's just that you need
to freshen, okay?

50:47.840 --> 50:48.908
-Okay.
-Absolutely.

50:48.941 --> 50:50.475
-Well, I'm going to go out

50:50.509 --> 50:52.711
and collect
those signatures y'all need...

50:52.745 --> 50:53.712
-Mm-hmm.
Oh, good.

50:53.746 --> 50:55.313
-...if you're going to run.

50:55.347 --> 50:56.648
-You're a busy woman.
-And I have to -- Oh.

50:56.681 --> 50:58.650
Well, that's --
-Get over here.

50:58.683 --> 51:00.352
-Thank you so much.
-Oh.

51:00.385 --> 51:01.386
I'd love to bring you
some muffins.

51:01.419 --> 51:02.387
-Thank you.
-Okay.

51:02.420 --> 51:03.555
-I just made blueberry ones.

51:03.588 --> 51:04.723
I love you, Genie.
-Thank you.

51:04.757 --> 51:05.858
-Okay.

51:05.892 --> 51:07.659
-I know Mae wants
to see you, so...

51:11.396 --> 51:13.598
-Did we get reached out
to by another gun store?

51:13.632 --> 51:14.834
-Well, technically,
I called them,

51:14.867 --> 51:17.602
but the rest was true.

51:17.636 --> 51:20.539
-Oh, my gosh.
I'm so excited.

51:20.572 --> 51:22.975
Yes.
-I have a stylist.

51:24.709 --> 51:26.045
Ooh, how much would you charge
for a campaign stop?

51:26.078 --> 51:27.612
I bet we could get Genie
to pay for it

51:27.646 --> 51:29.581
and we wouldn't have
to use your real name.

51:29.614 --> 51:30.817
-D, please.

51:30.850 --> 51:32.517
Let's get through
the makeover first.

51:32.551 --> 51:34.419
I know you wanted me to come
in butch realness,

51:34.452 --> 51:37.689
but I just promised myself
if I ever came back to Texas,

51:37.722 --> 51:39.558
it wouldn't be
as anything but myself.

51:39.591 --> 51:41.027
-I just want you to be safe.
I'm sorry.

51:41.060 --> 51:42.460
It was inappropriate of me
to ask you to dress

51:42.494 --> 51:43.830
differently than
you usually would.

51:43.863 --> 51:46.098
It was. I just --
I don't want to stifle you.

51:46.132 --> 51:47.566
I just want to make sure
you're safe,

51:47.599 --> 51:51.369
and I don't trust
anyone here to not be...

51:51.403 --> 51:54.639
-Attracted to my beauty?
I understand.

51:54.673 --> 51:57.475
Thank you.

51:57.509 --> 52:00.378
Oh, my God, your hand.
-Yeah, I know.

52:00.412 --> 52:02.414
It looks like shit.

52:04.750 --> 52:07.887
-Was it scary?

52:07.920 --> 52:09.922
-Yeah, it was really scary.

52:13.759 --> 52:15.061
-Are you sure
you want to do this?

52:15.094 --> 52:17.429
I mean, this is
legitimately insane, D.

52:17.462 --> 52:19.765
I mean, what are you even doing?

52:19.799 --> 52:22.001
-I'm running as a Republican
to beat another Republican.

52:22.034 --> 52:23.870
-You don't have
to exclaim everything.

52:23.903 --> 52:25.137
-I haven't been
exclaiming everything.

52:25.171 --> 52:26.605
You've been in the car
for five minutes.

52:26.638 --> 52:28.406
It's the first thing
I've exclaimed.

52:28.440 --> 52:29.809
I'm running as a Republican
to beat another Republican.

52:29.842 --> 52:31.509
There's a loophole in the state.

52:31.543 --> 52:32.945
If you win the primary
and drop out before the midterm,

52:32.979 --> 52:34.947
your side can't nominate
a new candidate.

52:34.981 --> 52:36.414
That's what I'm doing.

52:36.448 --> 52:38.017
-But what makes you think
that you can win?

52:38.050 --> 52:39.618
-I don't know. I mean,
people run and win on less.

52:39.651 --> 52:42.054
I'm a local hero.
And if I win,

52:42.088 --> 52:43.455
we'll have a Democrat
for the first time ever.

52:43.488 --> 52:44.757
-Okay.
So, what if you don't win?

52:44.790 --> 52:46.491
What if you're out and --
-Then fuck it.

52:46.524 --> 52:48.027
Like, I'm not gonna
technically get in any trouble,

52:48.060 --> 52:49.729
and maybe it'll at least
make people think twice about

52:49.762 --> 52:51.496
who they're fucking voting for.

52:51.529 --> 52:53.032
-Is this illegal?
-Aah!

52:53.065 --> 52:55.801
I don't know!
I mean, no, it's not illegal!

52:55.835 --> 52:57.669
Why is that your first question
about everything?!

52:57.702 --> 52:58.804
The world is illegal!

52:58.838 --> 53:00.907
-Yes, it's legal.

53:00.940 --> 53:03.910
Technically.
-Mm.

53:03.943 --> 53:08.546
Girl, what is not okay
is this hair.

53:08.580 --> 53:09.916
-Ugh.
-Honestly.

53:09.949 --> 53:12.517
I mean, I've checked out
the competition,

53:12.550 --> 53:14.921
and we're going to need
some strong looks to beat

53:14.954 --> 53:17.489
this Disney prince motherfucker.

53:17.522 --> 53:20.026
-My hair is fine.
-Mnh.

53:20.059 --> 53:21.928
-And Brent
is literally human feces.

53:21.961 --> 53:25.064
-Oh, that is not a great image.

53:25.097 --> 53:27.166
-You'll help me, then?
-Yeah.

53:27.199 --> 53:29.936
I mean, I've always wanted
to make you over.

53:29.969 --> 53:31.971
I never thought it would be
as a Republican.

53:34.539 --> 53:36.842
-Wow.
-Yep.

53:36.876 --> 53:39.544
-A pantsuit and a boot
and a sash and, like, a --

53:39.577 --> 53:43.082
a bowl cut?

53:43.115 --> 53:44.683
Ugh.
Wow.

53:44.716 --> 53:46.685
Conservative Spirit Award.

53:46.718 --> 53:48.888
You really were...

53:48.921 --> 53:51.556
a freak, huh?
-This is Greta.

53:51.589 --> 53:52.792
-So nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you, as well.

53:52.825 --> 53:53.926
-Sorry. I'm a hugger.
Oh, my gosh.

53:53.960 --> 53:55.560
-Okay.
-Oh.

53:55.593 --> 53:57.096
-I really don't wear pink.

53:57.129 --> 53:58.965
-Oh, no, this is more salmon.
-Yeah, that's salmon.

53:58.998 --> 54:00.632
And then this
is just a blush, but -- -Right.

54:00.665 --> 54:02.134
-I think this is kind of fun.

54:02.168 --> 54:04.203
I think that this would really
show your fun side.

54:04.236 --> 54:05.938
-Where'd you get this from?

54:05.972 --> 54:07.773
I love it.
-Um...

54:07.807 --> 54:10.109
-This would look great on you.

54:10.142 --> 54:11.576
This is for a woman.

54:11.609 --> 54:13.179
Have you ever sewed
for a living?

54:13.212 --> 54:14.213
-Yes, I do.

54:14.246 --> 54:15.815
-Really?
-Yes.

54:15.848 --> 54:18.250
I sing, and I sew.
-You're like a seamstress?

54:18.284 --> 54:20.786
I'm a singing seamstress.

54:20.820 --> 54:23.189
-And this one...
-Here. Try it from the box now.

54:23.222 --> 54:25.057
-There you go.

54:25.091 --> 54:27.259
-Oh, look at that, Dorothy.

54:27.293 --> 54:28.693
Look.
That'd be cute on you.

54:28.727 --> 54:29.929
-...a big Republican...

54:29.962 --> 54:31.063
-Take anything --
-Is it really okay?

54:31.097 --> 54:32.264
-Everything.

54:32.298 --> 54:33.698
Anything in there you want,
take it.

54:33.733 --> 54:35.034
-What do you know
about where this stands?

54:35.067 --> 54:36.736
And if he appoints her

54:36.769 --> 54:38.536
and not you, how are you
going to feel about that?

54:38.570 --> 54:40.940
-What did you do to him?
-Is it cheesy?

54:40.973 --> 54:43.142
-Absolutely.
-Absolutely fucking not.

54:43.175 --> 54:45.044
-I am going to vote for you.

54:45.077 --> 54:46.779
-I mean, everybody says
it's, like,

54:46.812 --> 54:48.580
the greatest day of your life,
and leading up to it,

54:48.613 --> 54:50.816
I was like, "I mean, come on,
it's not going to be --"

54:50.850 --> 54:52.752
And then after, it really was.

54:52.785 --> 54:54.619
-Reminds me of, um,
"Steel Magnolias."

54:54.652 --> 54:56.022
-Shelby, drink your juice.

54:56.055 --> 54:57.790
-Drink your juice, Shelby.
-Drink your juice.

54:57.823 --> 54:59.892
-Drink your juice.
-I know that, you know,

54:59.925 --> 55:02.694
you're working with Genie
and Greta's Guns and everything.

55:02.727 --> 55:04.063
I just, um --

55:04.096 --> 55:07.800
I really hope you'll get
some sort of regulations.

55:07.833 --> 55:11.137
I mean, I have two boys
in school, and, uh,

55:11.170 --> 55:13.205
it's really scary, so...

55:13.239 --> 55:15.074
But I don't tell many people
that, so...

55:15.107 --> 55:16.776
Anyway, you're gonna look
so cute.

55:16.809 --> 55:18.177
We're just going to just get you
right under the hood.

55:18.210 --> 55:19.745
Here we go.
Watch your face.

55:19.779 --> 55:21.080
-No, I think regulations
are really important.

55:21.113 --> 55:22.748

I don't want to be pregnant

-I don't know if this matters
right now,

01:01:10.996 --> 01:01:13.632
but I'm pro-choice, so...

01:01:13.665 --> 01:01:15.367
-I didn't know that.

01:01:15.401 --> 01:01:17.536

campaign on personal liberties,

01:01:17.569 --> 01:01:20.305
and that's your right
to police your own body, so...

-And the insane thing
is the only thing

01:01:22.141 --> 01:01:24.009
I'm thinking about right now
is how upset Genie would be,

01:01:24.042 --> 01:01:26.345

I'm the one who's pregnant.

01:05:15.207 --> 01:05:18.243
-I saw that. I saw that.
The convenience store hero.

01:05:18.276 --> 01:05:20.747
I read about that.
-She's a difference maker.

01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:24.449
-Yeah.
-Where were you on tour, sir?

01:05:25.852 --> 01:05:27.586
Oh, IHOP.

01:05:27.619 --> 01:05:29.421
How cool is that?

01:05:29.454 --> 01:05:32.190
-I thought we, uh,
deserved a treat after today.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:37.229
You want syrup?
-Just the syrup.

01:05:37.262 --> 01:05:38.731
You can have the spuds.

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.911
-Did you, uh...

01:05:51.944 --> 01:05:53.880
know any of the guys there
before today?

01:05:53.913 --> 01:05:55.480
I'd never seen
any of them before.

01:05:55.514 --> 01:05:57.215
-Yeah, no, I knew a few.

01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:04.489
-I always thought the cane
was just because you were old.

01:06:04.523 --> 01:06:06.558
Which sounds incredibly rude,
but I just -- I don't know.

01:06:06.591 --> 01:06:08.761
You just always seemed...

01:06:08.795 --> 01:06:11.329
I guess I was a kid, but --
-It's not 'cause I was old.

01:06:11.363 --> 01:06:13.565
I got shot.

01:06:13.598 --> 01:06:17.269
A bullet went straight
through my leg.

01:06:17.302 --> 01:06:21.306
They sent me home, thank God,
and saved my life probably.

01:06:21.339 --> 01:06:24.676
War is a terrible fucking thing.

01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:28.480
There's really no reason
to discuss this.

01:06:28.513 --> 01:06:30.582
You know what I hope?

01:06:30.615 --> 01:06:33.418
I hope you had a good day
with your campaign.

01:06:33.452 --> 01:06:35.353
I hope you made some progress.

01:06:38.523 --> 01:06:39.926
-It really wasn't about that.

01:06:39.959 --> 01:06:42.929
I mean, Greta did think it was
a good idea

01:06:42.962 --> 01:06:44.764
for us to, you know,

01:06:44.797 --> 01:06:46.733
put some more visibility
at the community center, but --

01:06:46.766 --> 01:06:48.433
-Can you tell me something?

01:06:48.467 --> 01:06:50.402
-Mm-hmm.
Maybe.

01:06:50.435 --> 01:06:52.604
-Honest?
-Mm-hmm.

01:06:52.637 --> 01:06:54.506
-No bullshit?
-Mm-hmm.

01:06:56.743 --> 01:06:58.410
-Why are you really running?

01:07:02.081 --> 01:07:05.617
-Um...

01:07:05.650 --> 01:07:10.589
I just feel like this town
and this state

01:07:10.622 --> 01:07:13.425
and our country could...

01:07:13.458 --> 01:07:15.762
use better leadership.

01:07:17.629 --> 01:07:19.531
-Really?
No bullshit?

01:07:23.035 --> 01:07:25.470
-I hate the other guy.

01:07:25.504 --> 01:07:27.472
-Is that --
is that the little turd

01:07:27.506 --> 01:07:30.042
that used to pick on you
all the time?

01:07:30.076 --> 01:07:31.911
-Yep.
-Oh, he's an asshole.

01:07:31.944 --> 01:07:34.579
-Yeah, he is.

01:07:34.613 --> 01:07:36.749
-Oh, my God.

01:07:36.783 --> 01:07:38.517
What we're doing right now...
-Mm-hmm.

01:07:38.550 --> 01:07:40.285
-...reminds me of your dad.

01:07:52.631 --> 01:07:53.800
-Tell me more
about Grandma Lois.

01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:55.333
I don't really know
a lot about her.

01:07:55.367 --> 01:07:57.003
I'm wearing her dress
and her jewelry,

01:07:57.036 --> 01:07:59.571
and I don't really know --

01:07:59.604 --> 01:08:01.506
I don't know.

01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:02.975
I don't know much about her.

01:08:03.009 --> 01:08:04.709
-She was a rebel.

01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:11.884
Also the most colorful woman
I ever knew.

01:08:11.918 --> 01:08:14.553
You know what she and your dad
used to do?

01:08:14.586 --> 01:08:15.855
I'd watch them
through the window

01:08:15.888 --> 01:08:17.555
when I came home from work,

01:08:17.589 --> 01:08:19.826
and they'd take the table
and shove it there.

01:08:19.859 --> 01:08:22.394
And the music was so loud,
the neighbors would come

01:08:22.426 --> 01:08:23.962
because they were like
complaining

01:08:23.996 --> 01:08:26.799
'cause the music was so loud
in the neighborhood.

01:08:26.832 --> 01:08:30.937
And they'd start dancing, and
then your grandma would start --

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:33.139
"Come on down.
Come on in and dance."

01:08:33.171 --> 01:08:34.807
She'd leave the door open.

01:08:34.841 --> 01:08:37.944
People would come in
and dance all around.

01:08:37.977 --> 01:08:39.745
Um...

01:08:39.779 --> 01:08:41.479
She loved people.

01:08:44.951 --> 01:08:46.451
-People scare the shit
out of me.

01:08:46.484 --> 01:08:48.921
Join the club, ma'am.

01:08:48.955 --> 01:08:51.389

-I'm Reggie Phillips, and this
is a breaking news report.

01:11:11.563 --> 01:11:13.833
Texas state legislature hopeful
Dorothy Goodwin,

01:11:13.866 --> 01:11:16.035
Republican of Alabaster,
recently famous

01:11:16.068 --> 01:11:20.272
as the convenience store hero,
is in the headlines again today.

01:11:20.306 --> 01:11:22.640
She and her campaign manager,
Greta Hoffman,

01:11:22.674 --> 01:11:24.576
also of Alabaster,
were seen visiting

01:11:24.609 --> 01:11:27.279
this Planned Parenthood
in downtown Austin.

01:11:27.313 --> 01:11:28.546
Ms. Goodwin,
a relative newcomer...

01:11:28.580 --> 01:11:29.782
-Excuse me.

01:11:29.815 --> 01:11:30.983
-Goodwin's campaign
lists nothing

01:11:31.017 --> 01:11:32.885
on their website
about the right to life,

01:11:32.918 --> 01:11:34.253
and Ms. Goodwin --

01:11:36.255 --> 01:11:38.290
-We're about to go live
at the Alabaster

01:11:38.324 --> 01:11:39.892
Women's Chamber of Commerce,

01:11:39.925 --> 01:11:41.894
where legislative candidate
Dorothy Goodwin

01:11:41.927 --> 01:11:43.728
and her campaign manger...
-Mouth guard.

01:11:43.763 --> 01:11:46.132
-...Greta Hoffman are due to
comment on allegations that --

01:11:46.165 --> 01:11:48.600
-Reporting on claims
that remain unsubstantiated

01:11:48.633 --> 01:11:51.871
outside of hearsay
is the definition of fake news.

01:11:51.904 --> 01:11:54.306
Um, I believe strongly
that these --

01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:56.008
these photos came out
of the Hart campaign.

01:11:56.042 --> 01:11:58.778
I will be addressing
this privately with Brent

01:11:58.811 --> 01:12:01.147
later this evening,
as we wish to get

01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:02.982
strongly back
on the path towards victory

01:12:03.015 --> 01:12:05.151
in the primaries,
which are coming up very soon.

01:12:05.184 --> 01:12:06.986
-Ms. Goodwin,
so, just to be clear,

01:12:07.019 --> 01:12:08.921
you were not
at the Planned Parenthood?

01:12:08.954 --> 01:12:10.823
-Again, I believe that it is
deeply beneath

01:12:10.856 --> 01:12:12.258
the sensibilities
of this campaign

01:12:12.291 --> 01:12:13.793
to even respond
to such accusations.

01:12:13.826 --> 01:12:15.127
Next question.

01:12:15.161 --> 01:12:17.629
-But are you pro-life?

01:12:17.662 --> 01:12:19.832
-Um, I don't know how many ways

01:12:19.865 --> 01:12:22.168
I can say that I am very pro
the lives of this community.

01:12:22.201 --> 01:12:24.136
That has always been true,
and it will continue to be true

01:12:24.170 --> 01:12:26.205
through my run and through--
-Are you pro-life?

01:12:26.238 --> 01:12:27.705
-I am very pro the lives

01:12:27.740 --> 01:12:29.241
of this community --
-It was me.

01:12:29.275 --> 01:12:30.910
-Greta, I don't think --
-It's fine.

01:12:30.943 --> 01:12:32.378
No, no, no.
I'm going to do this.

01:12:32.411 --> 01:12:34.980
Let me do this.

01:12:35.014 --> 01:12:36.849
Go. Go. Go.
-Okay.

01:12:36.882 --> 01:12:38.884
-Um...

01:12:38.918 --> 01:12:40.286
Okay.

01:12:40.319 --> 01:12:42.088
Whew.

01:12:42.121 --> 01:12:43.856
I'm Greta Hoffman.

01:12:43.889 --> 01:12:45.858
I'm a mom.

01:12:45.891 --> 01:12:47.026
I'm a wife.

01:12:47.059 --> 01:12:49.995
Um, I love my husband.

01:12:50.029 --> 01:12:51.397
I love my daughter.

01:12:51.430 --> 01:12:54.100
My husband, Fisher,
is away on active duty.

01:12:54.133 --> 01:12:55.901
Um...

01:12:55.935 --> 01:12:57.803
And not that it's any of
y'all's business,

01:12:57.837 --> 01:13:00.840
but we decided to do
what we feel is best

01:13:00.873 --> 01:13:03.843
for our family
in this moment in time.

01:13:03.876 --> 01:13:06.312
And I'm sorry,
I can't allow my friend Dorothy

01:13:06.345 --> 01:13:09.982
to stand here and answer for me
or for anyone to think

01:13:10.015 --> 01:13:11.750
I'm ashamed that I went
to Planned Parenthood

01:13:11.784 --> 01:13:13.385
because I went there
for support,

01:13:13.419 --> 01:13:15.087
and that's what they gave me,

01:13:15.121 --> 01:13:17.756
so that I, as a woman,
could make my own decision.

01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:20.793
That decision's going to remain
private, as is my right.

01:13:20.826 --> 01:13:23.728
But what I am happy
to share with y'all today

01:13:23.762 --> 01:13:26.198
is that I proudly
am pro-choice.

01:13:26.232 --> 01:13:30.970
Now, I'm a true Christian
and a proud Republican.

01:13:31.003 --> 01:13:32.938
And I love my country.

01:13:32.972 --> 01:13:34.306
I really do.

01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.908
But one of the founding
principles

01:13:35.941 --> 01:13:37.443
of the Republican Party, y'all,

01:13:37.476 --> 01:13:39.044
is individual rights.

01:13:39.078 --> 01:13:41.013
And you what to know
what that is?

01:13:41.046 --> 01:13:42.882
That's the government
keeping their hands

01:13:42.915 --> 01:13:44.783
off our bodies
in all the ways.

01:13:44.817 --> 01:13:46.752
-Mm-hmm.

01:13:46.785 --> 01:13:49.955
-And I'm sorry, but I feel like
this falls under that.

01:13:51.991 --> 01:13:53.658
Okay.
Thank you.

01:13:56.795 --> 01:13:58.764
-Dorothy?

01:13:58.797 --> 01:14:00.266
-We will be taking a brief --

01:14:00.299 --> 01:14:01.867
Oh.
-Excuse me.

01:14:01.901 --> 01:14:03.869
Uh, yeah, we will be taking
a brief recess,

01:14:03.903 --> 01:14:08.040
and, uh, if you excuse us
just for a moment.

01:14:08.073 --> 01:14:10.176
-Please state publicly your...

01:14:10.209 --> 01:14:12.278
-What is your position
on abortion, Ms. Goodwin?

01:14:12.311 --> 01:14:13.879
Please state for the record --

01:14:13.913 --> 01:14:15.481
what is your position
on abortion, ma'am?

01:14:15.514 --> 01:14:18.918
-I applaud Greta's bravery
today, sharing her story.

01:14:18.951 --> 01:14:20.718
Please clear the lawn.

01:14:29.261 --> 01:14:31.363
-America!

01:14:41.173 --> 01:14:43.008
This is a private club.
You know that?

01:14:43.042 --> 01:14:44.910
-I understand that.

01:14:44.944 --> 01:14:46.378
-You want to sit at the end
of the bar?

01:14:46.412 --> 01:14:47.913
It's a bit more private.

01:14:50.916 --> 01:14:53.185
This stays in this room.

01:14:53.219 --> 01:14:56.789
But I drove my college
girlfriend to get an abortion.

01:14:58.257 --> 01:14:59.992
-Is that that entire story?

01:15:02.027 --> 01:15:04.330
So, you drove a woman
to get an abortion in college?

01:15:04.363 --> 01:15:07.132
-No. Yeah.
-Do you want an award for that?

01:15:07.166 --> 01:15:09.368
-She's kidding.
She's kidding.

01:15:09.401 --> 01:15:11.937
You know what?
Yeah, I would.

01:15:11.971 --> 01:15:14.273
I drove her there and I stayed
through the whole procedure

01:15:14.306 --> 01:15:16.542
and then, at the end of it,
she broke up with me, so...

01:15:16.575 --> 01:15:18.244
-Well, that's the first time
I've actually, uh,

01:15:18.277 --> 01:15:21.380
respected any woman
that's ever decided to date you.

01:15:21.413 --> 01:15:23.048
-Well, then I don't know
what to tell you.

01:15:23.082 --> 01:15:25.317
You can believe me, you can not:
I didn't leak it.

01:15:25.351 --> 01:15:27.820
-I don't believe you.
Who else would do this?

01:15:27.853 --> 01:15:30.289
-Never mind.
Hey, look on the bright side.

01:15:30.322 --> 01:15:33.525
At least now we're going to get
a really great community center.

01:15:33.559 --> 01:15:36.061
And, oh, we're going to put in
pickleball courts.

01:15:36.095 --> 01:15:39.098
Have you ever played pickleball?
That game is a fucking blast.

01:15:41.133 --> 01:15:42.534
Cheers to the sweet
community center

01:15:42.568 --> 01:15:44.403
that we will one day build.

01:15:44.436 --> 01:15:46.238
-You're never going to build it;
you're going to build

01:15:46.272 --> 01:15:48.107
the dealership, and you're never
going to build it.

01:15:53.279 --> 01:15:55.414
Yeah.

01:15:57.850 --> 01:16:00.052
I need more wine.

01:16:00.085 --> 01:16:03.155
So, would you like
to join me in that?

01:16:03.188 --> 01:16:05.291
My treat.

01:16:05.324 --> 01:16:07.860
-Obviously.

01:16:07.893 --> 01:16:09.895
Do you even want to be
a politician?

01:16:11.997 --> 01:16:14.066
I mean, do you?

01:16:14.099 --> 01:16:17.002
-I've wanted to change
the world my entire life.

01:16:20.039 --> 01:16:21.507
-Dorothy, I --

01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:23.575
I'm the son of a senator,

01:16:23.609 --> 01:16:26.845
and I have literally
never seen politics do that.

01:16:29.048 --> 01:16:31.050
-I can't believe the guy
that started "Fat Dorothy"

01:16:31.083 --> 01:16:32.451
is going to beat me again.

01:16:32.484 --> 01:16:34.420
I'm sorry.

01:16:34.453 --> 01:16:37.022
You know it's -- you know it's
all karma, though, right?

01:16:37.056 --> 01:16:39.058
Because you called me stupid.

01:16:39.091 --> 01:16:41.060
-I never called you stupid.
-Oh, yeah, you did.

01:16:41.093 --> 01:16:44.363
We were in class one day,
and I made fun of the way

01:16:44.396 --> 01:16:45.998
your dad said something
or something like that,

01:16:46.031 --> 01:16:48.133
but I remember very clearly
you stood up,

01:16:48.167 --> 01:16:51.337
and your face --
it was beat red.

01:16:51.370 --> 01:16:52.971
And you pointed
your little finger at me,

01:16:53.005 --> 01:16:56.909
and you said,
"Brent Hart, you are stupid."

01:16:56.942 --> 01:16:58.444
-Well, even if that's true,
you're not stupid,

01:16:58.477 --> 01:17:00.946
and you've always know that,
and you knew that then,

01:17:00.979 --> 01:17:03.015
so it's a stupid reason to start
bullying me

01:17:03.048 --> 01:17:05.084
for the rest of time.
-Well, you're not fat,

01:17:05.117 --> 01:17:07.086
and you always knew that, so...
-I did not know that,

01:17:07.119 --> 01:17:09.455
as no women
in America know that.

01:17:09.488 --> 01:17:12.091
-No. You're beautiful.
You were not fat.

01:17:12.124 --> 01:17:14.993
-Ugh. Don't call me beautiful.
You don't get to tell me that.

01:17:15.027 --> 01:17:17.896
-Well, I am very sorry
that was an asshole to you.

01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:19.365
Truly.

01:17:19.398 --> 01:17:21.633
-If you were sorry,
you wouldn't do it anymore.

01:17:21.667 --> 01:17:23.569
-What do you mean?

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:25.337
-You know, you actually
have power here.

01:17:25.371 --> 01:17:27.973
It's like you could actually
do things differently.

01:17:28.006 --> 01:17:29.608
Politicians should want to lead.

01:17:29.641 --> 01:17:31.677
You don't seem like you
want to lead.

01:17:31.710 --> 01:17:34.012
That makes you an asshole.

01:17:34.046 --> 01:17:37.082
You could be doing
something else.

01:17:37.116 --> 01:17:38.384
-What -- I-I mean, what else
am I going to do?

01:17:38.417 --> 01:17:40.119
My family is here.

01:17:40.152 --> 01:17:42.187
This is what my family does,
and I love Texas.

01:17:42.221 --> 01:17:43.222
I really do.

01:17:43.255 --> 01:17:47.393
So I want to give to it.

01:17:47.426 --> 01:17:49.995
-You want to give it to Texas?

01:17:58.971 --> 01:18:00.939
I can't believe
I'm about to say this.

01:18:05.444 --> 01:18:08.180
I actually think you might do
an okay job,

01:18:08.213 --> 01:18:10.716
if you just try
really, really hard.

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:14.119
But I hope you do try really,
really hard...

01:18:14.153 --> 01:18:15.621
'cause I really care.

01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:26.298
So, cheers to you doing
the right thing.

01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:28.000
Good luck.

01:18:31.738 --> 01:18:34.440
-♪ He's Brent Hart

01:18:34.473 --> 01:18:37.643
♪ He's an American ma--

01:18:54.059 --> 01:18:56.161
-Hey!
-Hey!

01:18:56.195 --> 01:18:58.130
-What are you doing here?
I thought you'd be home.

01:18:58.163 --> 01:19:00.332
-I'm so happy you're here.

01:19:00.365 --> 01:19:02.334
You want to hang out with me?

01:19:05.537 --> 01:19:09.074
Can you believe that moment?

01:19:09.107 --> 01:19:11.710
We completely lost today, huh?

01:19:16.114 --> 01:19:19.051
-Eh. You don't think
there's any way

01:19:19.084 --> 01:19:22.054
we could come back from that?
-No. I don't think so.

01:19:24.122 --> 01:19:26.592
You would have made
such an amazing congresswoman.

01:19:26.625 --> 01:19:29.595
I'm sorry.

01:19:29.628 --> 01:19:31.396
-Don't be.
-You're such a good friend.

01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:32.564
I'm so grateful.
-I'm not.

01:19:32.598 --> 01:19:33.599
I'm not that good a friend.

01:19:33.632 --> 01:19:35.300
You're an amazing friend.

01:19:38.136 --> 01:19:40.606
-Good Lord.
I want to hear about Brent.

01:19:40.639 --> 01:19:42.508
Tell me all the Brent things.
-I don't know.

01:19:42.541 --> 01:19:44.109
The whole conversation
was weird.

01:19:44.142 --> 01:19:45.812
He just seemed so sad.

01:19:45.845 --> 01:19:47.780
And he doesn't want to be
a politician at all...

01:19:47.814 --> 01:19:49.381
-Really?
-...which is so weird.

01:19:49.414 --> 01:19:51.350
It felt like one of those
stress nightmares

01:19:51.383 --> 01:19:54.253
you have where everything
happens in the same nightmare.

01:19:54.286 --> 01:19:57.055
-That's what today
has kind of been, actually.

01:19:58.290 --> 01:20:01.226
Oh, wow, that's crazy.
-Yeah.

01:20:03.695 --> 01:20:08.233
-I was thinking, I never
actually apologized to you.

01:20:08.267 --> 01:20:09.635
-For what?

01:20:09.668 --> 01:20:12.271
-Brent was not
the only person that...

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:15.073
was not kind to you.

01:20:15.107 --> 01:20:16.341
I mean, come on.

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:18.176
I was silently a part of that,

01:20:18.210 --> 01:20:20.679
and kids were awful.

01:20:22.714 --> 01:20:24.449
-Kids are assholes.
-I'm so sorry.

01:20:24.483 --> 01:20:27.820
-I was an asshole, too.

01:20:27.854 --> 01:20:30.455
Remember that conversation
we had when we first...

01:20:32.524 --> 01:20:34.693
hung out or whatever
in the records room

01:20:34.726 --> 01:20:37.396
when I first got back to town?

01:20:37.429 --> 01:20:39.698
-Yeah.

01:20:39.732 --> 01:20:41.700
-Um...

01:20:41.734 --> 01:20:44.670
you asked me, you know, why
I stopped doing the musicals.

01:20:48.908 --> 01:20:52.745
I didn't stop 'cause I didn't
like doing them.

01:20:52.779 --> 01:20:54.713
I mean, after I started
getting bullied,

01:20:54.747 --> 01:20:56.481
I just sort of quit everything

01:20:56.515 --> 01:20:59.484
and started going
on the Internet,

01:20:59.518 --> 01:21:02.321
learning about the rainforest,
and that just spun me out

01:21:02.354 --> 01:21:04.489
into all of the other evils
of our world.

01:21:04.523 --> 01:21:06.425
And...

01:21:06.458 --> 01:21:09.896
I guess I just got to a point
where I felt like anything

01:21:09.929 --> 01:21:13.532
but trying to fix everything
was just a big waste of time.

01:21:13.565 --> 01:21:15.802
I feel like I owe you
an apology, too,

01:21:15.835 --> 01:21:19.404
'cause I feel like as much
as you weren't awesome to me...

01:21:22.374 --> 01:21:25.344
I was very jealous of you,

01:21:25.377 --> 01:21:27.412
'cause you just seemed like you
were good at being happy

01:21:27.446 --> 01:21:28.815
and like you had this --

01:21:31.316 --> 01:21:32.852
like you had this relationship
with my dad

01:21:32.885 --> 01:21:35.387
that came out of that,

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:40.225
that I could never really have.

01:21:40.258 --> 01:21:42.661
But I really wish I had spent
that time with him.

01:21:44.931 --> 01:21:49.501
-He would have been
so proud of you.

01:21:49.534 --> 01:21:51.804
I mean, oh, my God,
what you've done.

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:56.408
Dorothy, he loved you
more than anything.

01:22:27.706 --> 01:22:30.475
-Dorothy!
Get on down here!

01:22:30.509 --> 01:22:32.477
-And it has been
an interesting 24 hours,

01:22:32.511 --> 01:22:35.547
but after a very long
and very...

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:38.250
productive conversation
with my family,

01:22:38.283 --> 01:22:40.987
I have decided to hereby
withdraw my candidacy.

01:22:41.020 --> 01:22:44.423
I did have a conversation last
night with Dorothy Goodwin,

01:22:44.456 --> 01:22:46.725
and as a longtime
childhood friend,

01:22:46.759 --> 01:22:49.394
I feel confident
in leaving Paula County

01:22:49.428 --> 01:22:53.833
in her caring
and deeply well-informed hands.

01:22:53.866 --> 01:22:56.736
-Hands can't be well-informed.
-Oh, for Christ's sake.

01:22:56.769 --> 01:22:59.005
You won essentially.
How about that?

01:22:59.038 --> 01:23:01.406
-I can see that she is...
-We got anything?

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:04.309
You know where the -- the hard
stuff is in the cabinet?

01:23:04.342 --> 01:23:06.344
Go see if we have a real drink.

01:23:06.378 --> 01:23:09.949
-I feel confident,
but I will continue to support

01:23:09.982 --> 01:23:13.920
our great state by investing
in our burgeoning wine country,

01:23:13.953 --> 01:23:15.822
which is rivaling Napa now.

01:23:15.855 --> 01:23:17.824
I didn't know if you knew that.

01:23:17.857 --> 01:23:20.592
-This is good.
This is...

01:23:24.696 --> 01:23:27.532
-Hey, babe, could you grab
the box labeled "kitchen" next?

01:23:27.566 --> 01:23:29.969
-No problem, baby.
-Thanks, babe.

01:23:30.002 --> 01:23:31.838
-Baby.
-Baby.

01:23:37.810 --> 01:23:40.046
<i> -Dorothy, did you see the news?</i>
<i>Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</i>

01:23:40.079 --> 01:23:42.447
<i>What are you doing right now?</i>
-Yeah. No. I'm sorry.

01:23:42.481 --> 01:23:43.883
<i>-Are you running?</i>
-No, I was just going upstairs.

01:23:43.916 --> 01:23:45.517
I just --
<i>-We won! I mean,</i>

01:23:45.550 --> 01:23:47.352
<i>or we're definitely</i>
<i>going to win now.</i>

01:23:47.385 --> 01:23:49.721
-Yeah, it's -- it's so great,
such great news.

01:23:49.756 --> 01:23:52.290
<i> -Oh, and I have a favor to ask.</i>
<i>Would you mind coming with me</i>

01:23:52.324 --> 01:23:53.926
<i>to my next ultrasound</i>
<i>to record the screen?</i>

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:56.294
<i>'Cause it really helps Fisher</i>
<i>feel like he was there.</i>

01:23:56.328 --> 01:23:57.930
-Yeah.
<i>-It's the capital of</i>

01:23:57.964 --> 01:24:00.967
<i>Hubei Province, and that</i>
<i>province is all but sealed off</i>

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.634
<i>from the rest</i>
<i>of the country.</i>

01:24:02.667 --> 01:24:04.837
<i>Harsher lockdown measures</i>
<i>are in place,</i>

01:24:04.871 --> 01:24:05.838
<i>requiring billions of people</i>
<i>to stay at home --</i>

01:24:09.541 --> 01:24:11.077
-Dorothy.

01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:12.711
<i>-...and daily necessities</i>
<i>delivered to them.</i>

01:24:12.745 --> 01:24:16.015
<i>And in terms of the...</i>
-You basically won.

01:24:16.048 --> 01:24:18.583
<i>-...almost half of China's</i>
<i>population.</i>

01:24:18.617 --> 01:24:20.318
-What are you doing in there?

01:24:20.352 --> 01:24:21.954
-Frank, I just want
to be alone.

01:24:21.988 --> 01:24:24.422
-I can't hear
what you're saying.

01:24:24.456 --> 01:24:26.491
<i>-In terms of the scale here...</i>

01:24:26.525 --> 01:24:28.426
-I made you a sandwich.

01:24:33.465 --> 01:24:35.400
Can I sit down?

01:24:35.433 --> 01:24:36.969
-Please.

01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:44.110
-Geez, I...

01:24:44.143 --> 01:24:47.914
I don't really know what's going
on or what -- what you're up to.

01:24:47.947 --> 01:24:49.949
Seems to me you
should be celebrating.

01:24:49.982 --> 01:24:51.818
-I'm just...

01:24:51.851 --> 01:24:54.553
Tired.
-Sit with me.

01:24:59.792 --> 01:25:04.063
I worry about you so much,
you know?

01:25:04.096 --> 01:25:05.965
I don't know what's going on
with you,

01:25:05.998 --> 01:25:08.868
but I think you have
the greatest potential

01:25:08.901 --> 01:25:12.704
of any human being
I have ever seen in my life.

01:25:12.738 --> 01:25:16.108
And I'd be letting you down
if I didn't encourage you

01:25:16.142 --> 01:25:19.544
to take this spirit
and this heart and this mind

01:25:19.578 --> 01:25:21.948
and share it with the people.

01:25:21.981 --> 01:25:24.616
Have the courage to go out
and do that.

01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:26.752
Bear your heart
in front of them,

01:25:26.786 --> 01:25:29.588
and you'll win them over.

01:25:29.621 --> 01:25:32.959
This whole country
is waiting for the yous.

01:25:41.033 --> 01:25:45.872
I failed a lot at telling people
I loved them.

01:25:45.905 --> 01:25:48.741
But I want you to know...

01:25:48.774 --> 01:25:51.543
I love you, ma'am.

01:25:51.576 --> 01:25:54.747
And make no mistake
about who's telling you that.

01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:58.150
I love you.

01:25:58.184 --> 01:26:01.153
Listen, you've got a real
downtown asshole

01:26:01.187 --> 01:26:03.455
as a grandfather.

01:26:03.488 --> 01:26:06.893
But I did the best I could,
you know?

01:26:06.926 --> 01:26:08.493
Now you got a job.

01:26:08.526 --> 01:26:10.062
You won an election.

01:26:10.096 --> 01:26:11.596
You know, you got
to go out there.

01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:12.999
That's a win tonight.

01:26:13.032 --> 01:26:15.034
That asshole was no competition,
but, you know,

01:26:15.067 --> 01:26:17.837
you forced him to quit
because he knew he sucked.

01:26:19.939 --> 01:26:23.009

I don't plan on
losing this seat again.

01:32:56.068 --> 01:32:58.103
This is my fourth time running.

01:32:58.137 --> 01:33:00.939
And, believe me,
I know every trick in the book.

01:33:00.973 --> 01:33:04.843
I've had them all used on me
by candidates over the years,

01:33:04.877 --> 01:33:07.846
one supported by your buddies.

01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:10.182
And while I was impressed
by the intelligence

01:33:10.215 --> 01:33:13.385
behind your
pro-choice-adjacent behavior,

01:33:13.419 --> 01:33:15.321
I don't buy it for a minute.

01:33:15.354 --> 01:33:19.291

01:33:19.325 --> 01:33:22.494
-But I -- I really do believe
of all those things.

01:33:22.528 --> 01:33:24.930
That's why I ran this campaign.
-You don't believe anything.

01:33:24.963 --> 01:33:27.333
None of you believe any of that.

01:33:27.366 --> 01:33:29.234
-That's really not true. I --

01:33:29.268 --> 01:33:31.103

around on me,

it's not gonna happen again.

01:33:35.007 --> 01:33:36.308
-I'm sorry.
You leaked the photos of Greta?

01:33:36.342 --> 01:33:37.910
-That's just the beginning.

01:33:37.943 --> 01:33:39.411
I got the video
of you being arrested

01:33:39.445 --> 01:33:41.447

Greta, could you meet me outside

01:34:48.213 --> 01:34:49.982
just out back, please?
Thank you so much.

01:34:50.015 --> 01:34:52.084
Thanks so much. We'll just be
right back. I'm sorry.

01:34:52.117 --> 01:34:54.253
-What the actual fuck, Dorothy?!

01:34:54.286 --> 01:34:56.088
-I know. I never told -- I never
told a single campaign lie.

01:34:56.121 --> 01:34:57.623
-You never told a campaign lie?
-I have been registered

01:34:57.656 --> 01:34:59.291
as a Republican in Texas
my entire adult life.

01:34:59.324 --> 01:35:00.592
And, granted, it was to mess
with your primaries,

01:35:00.626 --> 01:35:03.529
but technically it's not a lie.

01:35:03.562 --> 01:35:05.164
Got us through anything
that was illegal.

01:35:05.197 --> 01:35:06.632
I would never put you
in that position.

01:35:06.665 --> 01:35:08.367
Wanted to mess with Texas,
but, like, not like --

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:10.102
-Well, you don't mess
with Texas.

01:35:10.135 --> 01:35:11.670
-Okay, I understand that.
It was a bad choice of words.

01:35:11.703 --> 01:35:13.505
Sally is so much worse
than Brent, which is completely

01:35:13.539 --> 01:35:15.307
my bad because I didn't
research her at all.

01:35:15.340 --> 01:35:16.975
I just bought based on brand,
which was the whole reason

01:35:17.009 --> 01:35:18.510
why I ran this campaign,
so joke's completely on me.

01:35:18.544 --> 01:35:20.345
-It's not a joke.
-I really thought --

01:35:20.379 --> 01:35:22.414
-It's not a joke, Dorothy.
Just let me talk!

01:35:22.448 --> 01:35:25.184
It's not a joke!

01:35:25.217 --> 01:35:27.085
You took it too far!

01:35:27.119 --> 01:35:29.288
We're real people.
I'm a real person.

01:35:29.321 --> 01:35:31.223
I don't know who you are.

01:35:31.256 --> 01:35:32.558
-You do know who I am.

01:35:32.591 --> 01:35:34.159
-I thought we were friends.
-We are friends.

01:35:34.193 --> 01:35:35.561
-And it's clear that you
just think I'm a moron.

01:35:35.594 --> 01:35:37.129
-I do not think you're a moron.

01:35:37.162 --> 01:35:38.397
-You thought I was a moron
in high school,

01:35:38.430 --> 01:35:39.766
and you think I'm a moron now.
-I don't.

01:35:39.799 --> 01:35:41.333
-And you don't actually care

01:35:41.366 --> 01:35:44.269
that I'm a real person
with real feelings.

01:35:44.303 --> 01:35:47.005
-I just hated this town so much.
I don't know how to explain it.

01:35:47.039 --> 01:35:50.442
I just hated this town so much
for what it did it to me, and...

01:35:52.812 --> 01:35:54.580
And for...

01:35:58.350 --> 01:36:01.653
And for what it did to my dad.
And...

01:36:06.191 --> 01:36:08.360
He was gay.

01:36:09.328 --> 01:36:11.663
And I didn't even know
until after he was dead.

01:36:11.697 --> 01:36:13.766
And it's not an excuse.
It's not an excuse.

01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:15.667
There's no excuse
for what I've done.

01:36:15.701 --> 01:36:19.137
But I -- I was at his funeral
looking at all these people

01:36:19.171 --> 01:36:20.706
who...

01:36:20.740 --> 01:36:24.243
loved him...

01:36:24.276 --> 01:36:27.179
but who were the reason
why he didn't have a full life.

01:36:30.817 --> 01:36:33.285
And maybe that was their fault,

01:36:33.318 --> 01:36:36.622
or maybe he just...

01:36:36.655 --> 01:36:39.391
made assumptions...

01:36:39.424 --> 01:36:42.394
just like I have.

01:36:42.427 --> 01:36:45.097
But whatever it did to me,
I just hated this place

01:36:45.130 --> 01:36:48.033
and just got really overwhelmed.

01:36:49.434 --> 01:36:52.571
I just got really
overwhelmed, and I'm sorry.

01:36:52.604 --> 01:36:56.675
I just hate the president
so much.

01:36:56.708 --> 01:36:58.443
I know you do, too!

01:36:58.477 --> 01:37:02.648
-It was the first time
in my life...

01:37:04.283 --> 01:37:08.353
...that anyone
has taken anything

01:37:08.387 --> 01:37:11.590
that I have thought
or felt seriously.

01:37:11.623 --> 01:37:14.794
And I...

01:37:14.827 --> 01:37:17.729
was something other than...

01:37:17.764 --> 01:37:19.665
Fisher's wife and a mom.

01:37:19.698 --> 01:37:21.233
And I loved you,
and I loved your dad.

01:37:21.266 --> 01:37:22.568
Of course I love your dad!

01:37:22.601 --> 01:37:24.336
Do I feel guilty? Yes.

01:37:24.369 --> 01:37:26.538
Do people in this town
probably feel guilty?

01:37:26.572 --> 01:37:29.174
Yes, but I'm...

01:37:29.207 --> 01:37:32.110
Ugh. God.

01:37:32.144 --> 01:37:33.712
I'm sorry about your dad.

01:37:33.746 --> 01:37:36.315
I loved him,
and I loved our time together,

01:37:36.348 --> 01:37:40.452
but I can't talk to you anymore
because...

01:37:40.485 --> 01:37:41.888
I have a family
and I have to --

01:37:41.921 --> 01:37:43.790
-No, no, wait, wait, wait. wait.
-I -- I can't.

01:37:43.823 --> 01:37:45.724
You're clearly going
through something, and I --

01:37:45.758 --> 01:37:47.693
-Please just hear me out.
-I'm actually quite mad.

01:37:47.726 --> 01:37:49.595
-You never have to listen --
I understand that.

01:37:49.628 --> 01:37:51.296
You don't have to stop
being mad at me.

01:37:51.330 --> 01:37:54.333
Just please hear me out, okay?
Look.

01:37:54.366 --> 01:37:57.904
It should be you running.
It should always have been you.

01:37:57.937 --> 01:37:59.772
-What?
-You should.

01:37:59.806 --> 01:38:01.908
You've run this whole campaign
on the idea of having courage

01:38:01.941 --> 01:38:03.810
when it isn't convenient.
When have I ever done that?

01:38:03.843 --> 01:38:05.310
-You really do need
psychiatric help.

01:38:05.344 --> 01:38:06.879
-No, I don't.
-Are you -- I'm confused.

01:38:06.913 --> 01:38:08.614
-I am right about this.
-This is a lot of information.

01:38:08.647 --> 01:38:10.382
-You are honest and you
are kind and you care!

01:38:10.415 --> 01:38:12.317
-Are you saying that I'm
supposed to be a politician?!

01:38:12.351 --> 01:38:14.519
-Absolutely!
-What are you talking about?!

01:38:17.623 --> 01:38:20.559
You are what we actually
need and deserve!

01:38:23.295 --> 01:38:25.297
I mean, I would vote for you.

01:38:26.833 --> 01:38:29.234
-I'm not a politician, Dorothy.

01:38:29.267 --> 01:38:32.504
-That's a matter of semantics.
I would vote for you.

01:38:32.537 --> 01:38:35.641
And I know that a lot of people
would, and I have an idea.

01:38:39.311 --> 01:38:42.749
Will you let me
try my idea, please?

01:38:42.782 --> 01:38:44.182
Please.

01:38:46.551 --> 01:38:49.254
-Don't you even want
to hear my idea?

01:38:53.993 --> 01:38:57.864
Ahh! You're insane!

01:39:00.599 --> 01:39:03.535
