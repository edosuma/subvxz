00:33.137 --> 00:36.575
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah, Cheetah

00:36.699 --> 00:39.853
This girl is a friend for life

00:39.982 --> 00:42.897
I'm gonna be there
when you need me, that's right

00:43.465 --> 00:46.425
Yeah, this girl's never gonna change

00:46.947 --> 00:50.260
No matter where I go,
I'll still be the same

00:50.390 --> 00:53.351
And this girl wants to have some fun

00:53.473 --> 00:56.911
So put your hands up
'cause we've only begun

00:57.035 --> 01:00.155
And there's no stopping us because

01:00.278 --> 01:03.671
We got that Cheetah love

01:03.801 --> 01:07.000
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls
We stick together for life

01:07.123 --> 01:10.516
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye,
but we roll side by side

01:10.646 --> 01:14.085
Yeah, there's nothing in the world
that we can't overcome

01:14.210 --> 01:18.445
Strength in numbers,
got each other, got that Cheetah love

01:18.573 --> 01:21.612
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah, Cheetah

01:21.735 --> 01:25.413
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah love

01:25.538 --> 01:28.533
I know there's a place to turn

01:28.661 --> 01:32.338
When I really need you to,
you put me first

01:32.465 --> 01:35.344
And my girls have always got my back

01:35.466 --> 01:39.145
No matter what happens,
I can count on that

01:39.270 --> 01:42.263
And when I wanna escape it all

01:42.391 --> 01:45.670
My sisters are always
gonna be my first call

01:45.795 --> 01:51.988
'Cause there's no stopping us
because we got that Cheetah love

01:52.681 --> 01:55.834
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls
We stick together for life

01:55.963 --> 01:59.356
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye,
but we roll side by side

01:59.486 --> 02:02.879
There is nothing in the world
that we can't overcome

02:03.009 --> 02:06.560
Strength in numbers,
got each other, got that Cheetah love

02:07.251 --> 02:10.723
I'll never be someone who hurts you

02:10.854 --> 02:14.168
I'll never be someone who deserts you

02:14.298 --> 02:17.737
We have a bond no one is breaking

02:17.861 --> 02:21.742
And if they try, we will still survive

02:22.665 --> 02:26.216
- Cheetah love
- Cheetah love

02:26.347 --> 02:29.626
- Cheetah love
- Cheetah love

02:29.750 --> 02:33.029

- Cheetah love

02:33.153 --> 02:35.224

02:35.354 --> 02:37.393
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls
We stick together for life

02:37.517 --> 02:38.666
Together for life

02:38.797 --> 02:41.438
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye,
but we roll side by side

02:41.559 --> 02:44.918
There is nothing in the world
that we can't overcome

02:45.042 --> 02:48.355
Strength in numbers,
got each other, got that Cheetah love

02:48.485 --> 02:51.763
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls
We stick together for life

02:51.887 --> 02:55.405
Sometimes we don't see eye to eye,
but we roll side by side

02:55.530 --> 02:58.889
There is nothing in the world
that we can't overcome

02:59.013 --> 03:03.249
Strength in numbers,
got each other, got that Cheetah love

03:03.377 --> 03:05.494
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah, Cheetah

03:05.618 --> 03:07.052
Side by side

03:07.179 --> 03:09.012
Cheetah, Cheetah
Cheetah love

03:09.142 --> 03:10.461
Cheetah, Cheetah

03:10.582 --> 03:12.496
- Love
- Cheetah love

03:12.625 --> 03:14.298
- Love
- Cheetah love

03:14.426 --> 03:15.985
- Love
- Cheetah love

03:16.107 --> 03:17.508
Love, love

03:17.629 --> 03:19.905
Love, Cheetah, love

03:20.070 --> 03:22.985
- Chanel, snap out of it.
- The song is over.

03:24.314 --> 03:26.306
- But they loved us.
- Who?

03:27.195 --> 03:28.710
The fans?

03:29.438 --> 03:30.667
That's it?

03:32.561 --> 03:34.154
It's kind of rough.

03:34.282 --> 03:35.431
Well, we're still working out the kinks.

03:35.562 --> 03:37.442
- Yeah, we used to be a foursome.
- Yes.

03:37.565 --> 03:38.634
Then Galleria got into Cambridge...

03:38.765 --> 03:40.245
Which, you know,
is great and amazing...

03:40.366 --> 03:42.119
Especially considering
her study habits.

03:42.247 --> 03:44.081
But that's why she's in summer school.

03:44.210 --> 03:47.683
- But trust us, we totally got this down.
- Yeah, whatever.

03:48.613 --> 03:51.607
Look, you get your act together,
you give me a call.

03:51.735 --> 03:54.536
Then we can talk about representation.

03:54.658 --> 03:55.853
Thanks.

03:58.541 --> 03:59.861
Now what?

03:59.982 --> 04:01.939
It just seems so hopeless.

04:03.945 --> 04:06.586
- What happened to your laptop?
- Nothing.

04:07.669 --> 04:09.342
You are not messing
with your computer

04:09.470 --> 04:11.826
so you can flirt
with that tech support guy?

04:12.313 --> 04:13.268
No.

04:14.994 --> 04:16.223
Maybe.

04:16.795 --> 04:18.594
He has a name.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.108
Kevin, extension 347.

04:21.358 --> 04:22.316
Wow.

04:22.441 --> 04:23.874
What is your dad going to say
when he finds out

04:24.002 --> 04:25.755
you've been wasting
precious study time

04:25.883 --> 04:27.236
flirting with the nerd patrol?

04:27.365 --> 04:31.645
Okay. We cannot all have a gorgeous,
devoted Spanish boyfriend.

04:33.289 --> 04:34.928
Well, actually,

04:36.451 --> 04:39.605
no one has a gorgeous,
devoted Spanish boyfriend.

04:40.014 --> 04:42.292
- What?
- Joaquin broke up with you?

04:42.417 --> 04:45.091
- I'm so sorry, Do.
- I'm okay.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.891
What happened?

04:47.019 --> 04:50.811
Time differences, phone bills.
I'm here, he's there.

04:51.703 --> 04:55.016
Things changed.
It just got to be too hard.

04:55.627 --> 04:58.507
Yo, I'm so sorry.
I know you really liked him.

04:58.629 --> 05:02.101
I'm cool. And I'm hungry.
Anybody else?

05:02.913 --> 05:04.791
- Starving as usual.
- Yeah.

05:04.914 --> 05:06.268
Let's get out of here.

05:06.395 --> 05:08.115
You pick whatever spot you want,
Do, all right?

05:08.237 --> 05:09.910
Anything but Spanish.

05:32.095 --> 05:34.134
I see you've met Ganesh.

05:34.618 --> 05:35.893
The statue?

05:36.459 --> 05:38.656
He's known as the remover
of obstacles.

05:38.781 --> 05:41.422
Well, that's perfect.
We've got nothing but obstacles.

05:41.543 --> 05:43.376
- Such as?
- No work.

05:43.505 --> 05:45.941
- No agent.
- No singing career.

05:46.067 --> 05:48.822
Sometimes all you need is a little faith.

05:51.991 --> 05:53.551
Okay, this is depressing.

05:53.673 --> 05:57.031
We've been on, like, a million auditions
and what have we booked?

05:57.155 --> 05:58.590
That would be nothing.

05:59.478 --> 06:00.832
I can't deal with the stress of failure.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.838
I'm already behind
in my reading for Columbia.

06:02.961 --> 06:04.839
We still have two months until college.

06:04.962 --> 06:05.952
Yeah, but when it does start,

06:06.083 --> 06:07.598
we're not going to have time
to rehearse.

06:07.725 --> 06:10.286
Maybe it is time for things to change.

06:10.406 --> 06:12.923
I really should be taking
that college prep class.

06:13.049 --> 06:16.566
Yeah, and I've got that dance camp
lined up for the summer.

06:16.691 --> 06:19.811
Are you guys seriously ready
to give up the Cheetah dream?

06:19.934 --> 06:23.054
- No. I don't want it to end.
- Me, either.

06:23.177 --> 06:25.647
Well, it's now or never,
so let's make it now.

06:25.779 --> 06:28.454
Look, I promise from now on,
I will stay so focused,

06:28.581 --> 06:30.334
nothing will get in our way.

06:31.583 --> 06:32.700
Exactly.

06:36.947 --> 06:38.098
Hello?

06:39.950 --> 06:40.986
Okay.

06:42.233 --> 06:44.225
Are you kidding?
Of course we're interested.

06:44.354 --> 06:45.834
What? Who is it?

06:45.955 --> 06:48.630
You want us to audition for a movie?
Where?

06:49.838 --> 06:51.431
Somebody wants
the Cheetah Girls to audition for,

06:51.559 --> 06:53.199
like, a huge Hollywood musical.

06:53.321 --> 06:56.121
Hello? Definitely, we will be there.

06:59.486 --> 07:01.079
Okay, what's the movie about?

07:01.207 --> 07:02.324
Yeah, I don't remember,

07:02.449 --> 07:05.442
because I kind of lost my focus
after the whole "Hollywood" part.

07:06.011 --> 07:07.890
- We have to get this.
- We will.

07:08.013 --> 07:10.654
I haven't been this nervous in so long.

07:11.335 --> 07:13.134
Our luck is changing. I can feel it.

07:13.257 --> 07:16.099
Well, what are we waiting for?
Cheetahs, it's on!

07:24.546 --> 07:27.347
No one can hold us back
when we're set to go

07:27.469 --> 07:28.458
Go!

07:28.589 --> 07:31.469
No one can tell us that we're not
ready when we're ready to flow

07:31.591 --> 07:32.582
Flow!

07:32.713 --> 07:35.991
Lead by example
Here's a sample on the floor

07:36.115 --> 07:38.233
Yeah, try a little harder
Move a little faster

07:38.357 --> 07:40.155
If you can't find the strength
you're after

07:40.278 --> 07:44.400
Dig a little deeper, dig a little deeper

07:44.522 --> 07:47.517
Just like we had to do it
Just like we had to do it

07:47.645 --> 07:52.404
You got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

07:56.651 --> 07:59.407
We're celebrating
like we never did before

07:59.534 --> 08:00.524
Before!

08:00.655 --> 08:03.455
Went through the fire,
took it higher, check the score

08:03.617 --> 08:04.573
Score!

08:04.698 --> 08:07.261
If you wanna be a leader,
check your ego at the door

08:07.381 --> 08:08.336
Right there

08:08.461 --> 08:12.299
Yeah, be a trendsetter, be a go-getter
if you want to do everything better

08:12.425 --> 08:16.306
Dig a little deeper, dig a little deeper

08:16.427 --> 08:19.661
Just like we had to do it
Just like we had to do it

08:19.790 --> 08:24.310
You got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

08:25.394 --> 08:28.309
Don't ask the question
what it is you should do

08:28.437 --> 08:29.393
Don't ask

08:29.518 --> 08:32.399
Just take some action, it'll come to you

08:32.520 --> 08:33.510
It will

08:33.640 --> 08:37.033
It's all connected
All you have to do

08:37.164 --> 08:41.126
Is move, baby, move, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah

08:41.246 --> 08:44.287
You're on a roll, let it go, lose control

08:44.410 --> 08:48.406
Don't you know it's the best thing
you can do?

08:48.733 --> 08:50.247
Yeah!

09:00.062 --> 09:01.052
Go!

09:02.505 --> 09:04.417
- Dig a little deeper
- Here we go

09:04.546 --> 09:08.508
Dig a little deeper, dig a little deeper

09:08.629 --> 09:11.703
Just like we had to do it
Just like we had to do it

09:11.831 --> 09:12.868
Like we had to

09:12.993 --> 09:16.624
You got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

09:16.755 --> 09:19.795
Just like we had to do it
Just like we had to do it

09:19.918 --> 09:24.712
You got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

09:26.323 --> 09:27.758
Just like we had to do

09:27.885 --> 09:32.041
You've got to dig a little deeper
Dig a little deeper

09:32.169 --> 09:33.204
Yeah

09:40.054 --> 09:41.695
Just give us a moment, please.

09:41.695 --> 09:42.129
Just give us a moment, please.

09:42.977 --> 09:45.014
Okay. All right.
How do you think we did?

09:45.138 --> 09:47.257
- We nailed it.
- I so want to go to California.

09:47.381 --> 09:50.101
- We are going to California.
- Here he comes.

09:50.222 --> 09:54.538
Hi, and thank you for coming.
I'm the director. Well, I'm Vik.

09:55.026 --> 09:59.945
But actually my parents say,
"Hello, Vikram." But I prefer Vik.

10:03.914 --> 10:06.349
So anyway, I'm Vik, the director.

10:07.437 --> 10:08.665
You were very, very good.

10:08.798 --> 10:10.915
- Amazing, really.
- Thank you.

10:11.599 --> 10:12.750
We have a plane to catch.

10:12.881 --> 10:14.918
Right. So, here's the deal.

10:15.042 --> 10:17.001
I would like you, all of you,
to star in my movie.

10:17.125 --> 10:20.243
My first Bollywood movie.
If that's okay with you.

10:20.967 --> 10:22.288
We're going to be in a movie

10:22.409 --> 10:23.558
Yes! Yes! Yes!

10:23.690 --> 10:24.679
Thank you, thank you.

10:24.810 --> 10:26.449
You have no idea
what this means to us.

10:26.571 --> 10:27.722
No, thank you.

10:27.853 --> 10:30.574
If it wasn't for you, I'd be packing
my bags for dental school.

10:30.695 --> 10:34.088
Nothing, it's...
Well, just my parents, they...

10:35.098 --> 10:37.410
Never mind.
So you're cool with the schedule, right?

10:37.541 --> 10:39.180
Your flight leaves
the day after tomorrow.

10:39.302 --> 10:41.453
Things move fast in Bollywood.

10:41.583 --> 10:43.496
The Cheetahs are going...

10:44.346 --> 10:46.338
- What did he just say?
- Bollywood.

10:46.467 --> 10:47.902
That's what I thought you said.

10:48.029 --> 10:49.748
India? Bollywood?

10:50.791 --> 10:52.863
The movie-making capital of the world?

10:52.993 --> 10:55.793
India?
Like the other side of the world, India?

10:55.915 --> 10:57.191
- Chanel.
- Bollywood. Hollywood.

10:57.317 --> 10:59.274
My cell phone connection
was bad, okay?

10:59.398 --> 11:00.514
Stupid teléfono.

11:00.639 --> 11:02.950
I'm positive I said that we'd be
shooting in Mumbai.

11:03.081 --> 11:04.515
Okay. Well, like, in my defence,

11:04.642 --> 11:06.952
I didn't exactly know
where Mumbai was.

11:07.085 --> 11:09.281
It's the biggest city in India.

11:09.406 --> 11:12.401
You'll love it.
I mean, I hope that you'll love it.

11:13.970 --> 11:15.848
No, I'm sorry.

11:16.691 --> 11:18.490
Why are we sorry? We're not sorry.

11:18.613 --> 11:20.252
Is there a problem?
There can't be a problem.

11:20.375 --> 11:22.333
Yeah, I don't have time for a problem.

11:22.457 --> 11:24.210
Yeah. There is.

11:24.338 --> 11:27.174
I'm sorry. There's not a problem.
Could you just give us a minute?

11:27.301 --> 11:28.290
Sure.

11:29.742 --> 11:32.464
Come on. This is a chance of a lifetime.

11:32.585 --> 11:35.784
Hello? Once again, India,
other side of the world!

11:35.907 --> 11:37.024
Yeah, I thought we were going to try

11:37.149 --> 11:39.948
to make it big
on this side of the world first.

11:40.070 --> 11:41.868
And I have a college prep this summer.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.346
And I'm teaching dance camp.

11:43.473 --> 11:44.827
Dance camp and college prep?

11:44.954 --> 11:46.513
This is an opportunity for
the Cheetah Girls

11:46.635 --> 11:49.391
to become international movie stars.

11:49.518 --> 11:51.475
How can you pass this up?

11:52.321 --> 11:55.633
You're serious?
You really think we should do this?

11:55.763 --> 11:58.074
I am more sure about this
than I've been about anything.

11:59.366 --> 12:01.403
This is our Cheetah destiny.

12:01.929 --> 12:04.683
It is the movie-making
capital of the world.

12:06.251 --> 12:09.052
I guess I can get some
studying done on the plane.

12:09.174 --> 12:12.772
And I could probably teach
the second session of dance camp.

12:12.897 --> 12:15.048
Yo, and come on.
That director's mad cute.

12:15.178 --> 12:16.771
I know.

12:16.899 --> 12:20.339
Wait. No. No talk about boys.

12:20.463 --> 12:23.343
- Cute or not cute.
- All right, cool. No talk about boys.

12:23.465 --> 12:25.058
Anything else?

12:25.186 --> 12:26.859
Yeah, just one thing.

12:27.709 --> 12:29.428
We're going to India!

12:32.513 --> 12:33.708
One girl, Vik.

12:33.834 --> 12:36.110
You're supposed to bring back one girl.

12:36.235 --> 12:38.228
What's your uncle going to say
when you show up with three?

12:38.357 --> 12:39.586
Once my uncle meets them,

12:39.718 --> 12:42.793
he'll see that they should
all be in the movie.

12:42.921 --> 12:44.435
Don't you maybe just
want to talk to your uncle

12:44.562 --> 12:45.837
before you make this decision?

12:45.963 --> 12:48.479
Look, okay,
the Cheetah Girls are my stars.

12:48.606 --> 12:52.397
I'll just rewrite the script for
three beautiful leading ladies.

12:53.249 --> 12:54.729
Why do I have to tell my uncle?

12:55.611 --> 12:58.811
Because he's the producer.
He's paying for the movie.

13:00.295 --> 13:02.891
Right. There's always that.

13:14.786 --> 13:17.462
It's going to be so good to get out
of New York for the summer.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.943
I know, the heat.

13:19.070 --> 13:21.027
And all that crazy traffic.

13:27.917 --> 13:29.954
Watch out! Watch out!

13:34.762 --> 13:37.154
- Okay, slow down!
- Oh, my God!

13:43.970 --> 13:46.087
Okay, so it's crowded and hot.

13:46.211 --> 13:48.044
Yeah, but we're in India.

13:48.173 --> 13:50.291
And it's Cheetah-licious!

14:31.407 --> 14:34.641
Loving Mumbai. This hotel is beautiful.

14:34.770 --> 14:35.965
Room service.

14:36.091 --> 14:38.209
And jewellery for sale
right by the front door.

14:45.098 --> 14:46.327
Wow.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.177
Yes.

14:49.302 --> 14:50.452
Cheetah...

14:50.583 --> 14:53.099
Are you sure you got it?

14:53.225 --> 14:54.500
Okay. Right this way.

14:54.626 --> 14:55.776
Please don't drop
the bag on the bottom.

14:55.907 --> 14:57.627
It's muy importante.

14:59.830 --> 15:02.188
Well, at least she packed light.

15:11.679 --> 15:13.593
- Here you go. Have a good day.
- Thank you.

15:13.722 --> 15:15.315
You're welcome.

15:20.967 --> 15:22.004
Miss?

15:22.449 --> 15:24.406
- Come here. Come.
- Thank you, sir.

15:24.530 --> 15:27.093
- My mom will love this.
- You're welcome.

15:31.175 --> 15:35.012
- Take this string and tie it in the tree.
- Don't get me wrong.

15:35.139 --> 15:38.418
I mean, it's colourful, but I think
there's enough strings in this tree.

15:38.542 --> 15:39.531
It's for a wish.

15:39.662 --> 15:41.619
You make a wish, tie the string,

15:41.745 --> 15:43.657
and when it comes true, you return,

15:43.786 --> 15:46.381
untie the string, and say thank you.

15:46.789 --> 15:49.702
- To the tree?
- Who else?

15:51.391 --> 15:53.384
Come on, Cheetahs,
we could use the luck.

15:53.514 --> 15:56.154
Everybody grab a string.
Come on, let's make a wish.

15:56.275 --> 15:57.676
Thank you.

16:34.826 --> 16:36.624
Who would ever think
that a girl from New York

16:36.749 --> 16:40.426
would be in this beautiful hotel room
next to the Indian Ocean?

16:40.551 --> 16:41.872
Arabian Sea.

16:43.514 --> 16:46.348
Pardon me for ever
cracking open a guidebook.

16:54.002 --> 16:56.997
Hey, should I call Kevin 347 now?

16:57.125 --> 16:58.639
'Cause it's night back home.

16:58.766 --> 17:01.966
Or should I wait until tonight,
which is yesterday?

17:02.089 --> 17:04.205
Honestly, why are you
even wasting your time?

17:04.329 --> 17:06.049
Phone relationships are doomed.

17:06.171 --> 17:07.731
You used to think it was romantic.

17:07.853 --> 17:10.130
Yeah, well, learn from my mistakes.

17:10.255 --> 17:12.531
Ready for your close-ups,
amigas Cheetahs?

17:12.656 --> 17:14.137
Vik just sent over
the rehearsal schedule,

17:14.258 --> 17:16.295
and if we don't hurry up,
we're going to be late.

17:16.419 --> 17:18.333
- Ch-chop.
- All right.

17:19.622 --> 17:20.942
Hey, Chanel?

17:22.464 --> 17:24.661
- Thanks.
- For what?

17:25.267 --> 17:27.339
You know,
for believing in the Cheetahs.

17:27.469 --> 17:30.190
Yeah, if it wasn't for you,
we'd never be here.

17:30.311 --> 17:31.426
You were fierce.

17:31.551 --> 17:32.872
You guys know
there's nothing I wouldn't do

17:32.993 --> 17:34.552
to keep the Cheetahs together.

17:34.674 --> 17:36.074
Including kick their butts and tell them,

17:36.195 --> 17:38.348
"We have got to go."
We've got to get ready.

17:38.478 --> 17:40.231
- Bollywood, here we come.
- Yeah.

17:47.165 --> 17:50.000
- Look at that.
- Check that out.

17:52.929 --> 17:55.126
Let them know
the Cheetah Girls have arrived.

17:56.611 --> 17:58.171
I can't believe this is really happening.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.283
- Really.
- This is amazing.

17:59.414 --> 18:00.734
Better than amazing.

18:14.226 --> 18:15.376
The Taj Mahal.

18:15.507 --> 18:18.308
Built in 1643, it's one of
the Seven Wonders of the World.

18:18.430 --> 18:22.711
And one of the most
romantic places in all of India.

18:25.035 --> 18:27.756
They say if you kiss
someone there at sunset,

18:27.877 --> 18:30.791
you'll know in your heart
if your love is true.

18:33.121 --> 18:35.159
Well, you can count me out.

18:35.923 --> 18:37.802
- What?
- Glad you made it.

18:37.925 --> 18:38.995
Me, too.

18:40.807 --> 18:42.003
Shall we?

18:46.571 --> 18:49.008
So I really wanted to do
a more traditional remake

18:49.134 --> 18:50.887
of the classic hit Namaste Bombay.

18:51.015 --> 18:52.928
But, Uncle, the producer,

18:53.057 --> 18:54.810
well, it was his idea
to make it more marketable.

18:54.939 --> 18:58.617
Cast Americans, make it more modern,
more contemporary.

18:58.742 --> 19:00.574
Well, what's the script about anyway?

19:00.703 --> 19:02.696
Well, there's still a couple of
adjustments that we have to make.

19:02.825 --> 19:05.705
But basically... It's a love story.

19:06.467 --> 19:07.822
I love romance.

19:07.949 --> 19:10.226
I can't wait to tell
Kevin about our movie.

19:10.351 --> 19:12.821
Hello? Does anyone
remember the deal? No boys.

19:12.953 --> 19:14.069
My bad.

19:14.194 --> 19:17.712
Anyway, it's classic Bollywood cinema.

19:18.358 --> 19:22.559
It's all about singing, dancing,
romance and intrigue.

19:23.242 --> 19:26.601
- That's Rahim. He's your co-star.
- He's our co-star?

19:27.445 --> 19:28.720
He's a big star,

19:28.846 --> 19:30.246
like Bollywood royalty.

19:30.447 --> 19:32.041
And Uncle gave him his first movie.

19:33.049 --> 19:34.085
Here he comes now.

19:51.585 --> 19:52.574
Please, can I have your autograph?

19:52.705 --> 19:54.537
- Please, please, please?
- Sign mine, please.

19:56.027 --> 19:57.257
- Gorgeous.
- Thank you, thank you.

19:57.389 --> 19:59.460
- Who should I make this out to?
- My mom.

19:59.590 --> 20:00.990
No, wait, wait, me!

20:01.111 --> 20:03.548
No, no, no, no, my mom, my mom!
Sorry.

20:04.434 --> 20:06.505
My mom loved your parents
in Namaste Bombay.

20:06.637 --> 20:09.516
And they actually fell in love
with each other while filming.

20:09.638 --> 20:12.474
Wow, that is so romantic.

20:12.601 --> 20:15.356
- Yes, it is very romantic. Thank you.
- Thank you!

20:15.483 --> 20:16.759
Next, please.

20:18.366 --> 20:19.846
Who should I make this out to?

20:21.929 --> 20:24.923
- That is so embarrassing.
- Girl, he's just a guy.

20:26.131 --> 20:30.253
Rahim. Meet your co-leads.
Chanel. Dorinda. Aqua.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.930
Nice to meet you. I hear you're great.
I'm looking forward to working with you.

20:38.262 --> 20:40.493
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get busy writing.

20:40.623 --> 20:42.263
Well, rewriting.

20:43.946 --> 20:45.744
Come on, ladies. They're ready for you.

20:48.870 --> 20:50.145
Bye.

20:58.838 --> 21:01.514
I don't understand. These Americans
are supposed to be on time.

21:01.641 --> 21:05.079
Hey, ladies. I can't spend
half my day chasing after...

21:06.043 --> 21:07.637
Hi, Rahim.

21:08.486 --> 21:11.001
That's Gita. She's our choreographer.

21:13.890 --> 21:16.200
- She's our choreographer?
- Yeah.

21:17.933 --> 21:19.128
Whoa.

21:19.614 --> 21:20.764
- Hi, Rahim.
- Gita, let me help you.

21:20.895 --> 21:22.774
- I didn't know you were...
- You're fine, yeah? You okay?

21:22.897 --> 21:24.855
- Okay.
- I'm okay. He was supposed to be...

21:24.979 --> 21:26.412
Careful!

21:33.786 --> 21:36.462
Rahim. Rahim. We have to go.
He's got his costume fitting.

21:36.589 --> 21:39.582
- It's okay.
- It's okay. Okay, bye.

21:39.710 --> 21:40.860
- Bye.
- Excuse us, ladies.

21:40.991 --> 21:42.346
- Bye.
- Later.

21:44.634 --> 21:46.514
- I think he just snorted.
- Yeah, twice.

21:46.637 --> 21:48.390
Yeah, kind of over him.

21:49.839 --> 21:51.718
Okay, ladies. Come on in.

21:54.482 --> 21:56.521
Okay, listen up.

21:56.645 --> 21:59.604
I've managed to track down our stars.
This is...

21:59.726 --> 22:00.876
- Aqua.
- Dorinda.

22:01.007 --> 22:02.488
- What's up? Chanel.
- Hi.

22:02.609 --> 22:04.566
And these are your dancers.

22:06.493 --> 22:08.803
Vik says you're amazing dancers,

22:08.934 --> 22:10.687
so you shouldn't have
a problem picking it up.

22:10.815 --> 22:12.455
- You ready?
- Yeah.

22:12.817 --> 22:16.095
So it's one, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four, one, two, three.

22:16.219 --> 22:17.813
One, two. Pop.

22:18.982 --> 22:20.894
One, two, three, four.

22:22.865 --> 22:24.265
Bollywood 101.

22:25.347 --> 22:27.863
Well, what if you haven't had,
like, Bollywood one?

22:27.989 --> 22:30.505
- Is it all going to be like this?
- All right!

22:30.631 --> 22:32.430
Five, six, seven, eight.

22:32.553 --> 22:35.069
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four. One, two, three...

22:35.195 --> 22:37.028
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

22:38.318 --> 22:42.360
Sorry. It's just, you know,
we've really never done this before.

22:42.481 --> 22:45.043
Yeah. I can see that.

22:45.163 --> 22:46.837
Are you saying we can't dance?

22:46.965 --> 22:48.000
It's okay.

22:48.126 --> 22:51.599
It's my job to make sure you look
like you can, even if you can't.

22:51.729 --> 22:54.198
All right, people. I think we have to
break it down even more.

22:55.131 --> 22:56.041
A lot more.

22:56.251 --> 22:57.686
That's it. You got to stop!

22:57.813 --> 23:00.613
Chica, look, she's the choreographer.
It's her vision.

23:00.735 --> 23:03.252
- Whatever. Just chill.
- We'll get it. It's new. Come on.

23:03.378 --> 23:04.778
All right. Whatever.

23:04.899 --> 23:07.938
But nobody tells me I can't dance.
Let's see your moves.

23:08.902 --> 23:10.256
Come on, bring it, bring it.

23:10.383 --> 23:13.264
- Yeah, let's see what you've got.
- Come on, girl.

23:24.835 --> 23:26.748
Are you sure that you're up for this?

23:26.877 --> 23:28.436
Do you think you can handle it?

23:28.558 --> 23:33.238
It's complicated
You might get frustrated

23:33.362 --> 23:35.433
We got the moves that you never seen

23:35.563 --> 23:37.283
Let me show you just what I mean

23:37.405 --> 23:41.402
There's really no chance
that you can do our dance

23:41.529 --> 23:43.486
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

23:43.610 --> 23:45.522
Try to keep up, try to keep up, yeah

23:45.651 --> 23:47.883
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

23:48.014 --> 23:49.733
Oh, no

23:49.855 --> 23:51.848
Oh, no, show me what you got

23:51.977 --> 23:54.094
Try to follow, watch me now

23:54.218 --> 23:57.372
If you think that you know how,
then dance me

23:58.182 --> 24:00.299
Dance me if you can

24:00.423 --> 24:02.575
Get it together or fall apart

24:02.705 --> 24:05.585
If you think it's not that hard,
then dance me

24:06.509 --> 24:09.149
Dance me if you can

24:10.751 --> 24:12.789
Dance me if you can

24:12.913 --> 24:16.225
Dance me
Dance me if you can

24:17.077 --> 24:19.069
I know you think that you're in control

24:19.198 --> 24:21.795
But watch and learn
'cause this is how we roll

24:21.921 --> 24:25.438
Work it just like this
Let's see you try and do that

24:25.563 --> 24:27.203
What's the matter?
Can't you figure it out?

24:27.325 --> 24:29.601
'Cause you look confused,
mixed up, no doubt

24:29.727 --> 24:33.803
There's really no chance
that you can do our dance

24:33.930 --> 24:35.887
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

24:36.011 --> 24:37.924
Try to keep up, try to keep up, yeah

24:38.054 --> 24:40.330
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

24:41.497 --> 24:43.295
- Come on, come on
- Yeah, yeah

24:43.418 --> 24:44.373
Show me what you got

24:44.498 --> 24:46.537
Try to follow, watch me now

24:46.661 --> 24:49.415
If you think that you know how,
then dance me

24:49.582 --> 24:50.538
Dance me

24:50.663 --> 24:51.620
Dance me if you can

24:51.745 --> 24:52.700
Oh, yeah

24:52.825 --> 24:54.943
Get it together or fall apart

24:55.067 --> 24:57.742
If you think it's not that hard,
then dance me

24:57.869 --> 24:58.825
Dance me

24:58.950 --> 25:00.179
Dance me if you can

25:00.311 --> 25:01.746
Yeah!

25:01.873 --> 25:04.468
Is that the best that you can do?

25:06.115 --> 25:09.554
You're gonna have to try much harder

25:10.519 --> 25:13.832
Now's the time to make your move,
you know

25:13.962 --> 25:17.560
Hey, hey, get ready!
Hey, hey, let's go!

25:21.729 --> 25:22.718
Yeah!

25:29.574 --> 25:31.088
That's right

25:42.225 --> 25:43.625
Here we go

25:46.429 --> 25:47.908
What?

25:49.550 --> 25:50.984
Yeah, yeah!

25:51.513 --> 25:53.709
Try to follow, watch me now

25:53.834 --> 25:56.351
If you think that you know how,
then dance me

25:56.477 --> 25:57.512
Dance me

25:57.637 --> 25:59.755
- Dance me if you can
- Dance me if you can

25:59.879 --> 26:02.031
Get it together or fall apart

26:02.161 --> 26:04.677
If you think it's not that hard,
then dance me

26:04.803 --> 26:05.792
Dance me

26:05.923 --> 26:08.121
- Dance me if you can
- Dance me if you can

26:08.246 --> 26:10.363
- Everybody wants to win
- Wants to win

26:10.487 --> 26:13.641
If you think you can handle it,
then dance me

26:13.770 --> 26:15.648
Dance me if you can

26:15.771 --> 26:18.732
- Make it look easy, that's the way
- That's the way

26:18.854 --> 26:21.894
If you think you got what it takes,
then dance me

26:22.777 --> 26:25.737
- Dance me if you can
- Dance me if you can

26:28.022 --> 26:29.091
Yeah!

26:33.786 --> 26:35.300
- That was great!
- Awesome.

26:37.109 --> 26:38.384
Hello, ji.

26:39.711 --> 26:42.386
Myself, Kamal Bhatia.
Who might you be?

26:43.234 --> 26:46.354
We're the stars of the movie.
We're the Cheetah Girls.

26:46.477 --> 26:49.151
Stars? Vikram Kumar Bhatia!

26:52.481 --> 26:53.915
Why you hiding?

26:55.403 --> 26:56.633
I see you.

27:01.209 --> 27:02.198
Yes, Uncle-ji.

27:02.329 --> 27:06.085
One star.
Your script is saying one star.

27:06.213 --> 27:10.254
Your budget is saying one star.
So I am saying, one star.

27:11.217 --> 27:13.493
- What?
- But there are three of us.

27:14.138 --> 27:15.697
Well, I just made a couple of changes.

27:15.819 --> 27:18.177
But budget has
not made couple of changes.

27:18.302 --> 27:20.498
Listen, Uncle, these girls are fantastic.

27:20.623 --> 27:23.060
If you would just take
a moment to watch them perform,

27:23.186 --> 27:24.666
I'm sure that you'll see that they have...

27:24.787 --> 27:27.508
- Good idea.
- But I really think that they have...

27:27.629 --> 27:28.665
What? Excuse me?

27:28.790 --> 27:32.672
Each Cheetah performs.
I will choose best one.

27:33.034 --> 27:35.868
What? Like, audition?

27:36.717 --> 27:39.027
- Against each other?
- Correct.

27:39.158 --> 27:43.235
I will choose one star,
others go home. Goodbye.

27:44.482 --> 27:47.557
Otherwise,
two ladies are having Indian holiday

27:47.685 --> 27:49.643
and Kamal Bhatia is paying.

27:49.767 --> 27:52.887
- No, no, no, no. No, no.
- Okay. Uncle, please.

27:53.010 --> 27:56.608
But I'm the director.
I spent days rewriting the script.

27:57.533 --> 27:59.172
- Do you want to make movie?
- Yes.

27:59.294 --> 28:00.694
Or shall I telephone your parents

28:00.815 --> 28:03.810
and tell them you would
prefer to be dentist?

28:04.378 --> 28:06.611
Good point. I'll start rewriting.

28:07.221 --> 28:09.019
- Again.
- Good idea.

28:10.343 --> 28:11.744
Goodbye.

28:20.791 --> 28:21.828
What is going on?

28:21.953 --> 28:24.229
You can't book one of us
and not the other.

28:24.354 --> 28:28.397
Okay, we're a group.
You cast the Cheetahs. Plural.

28:28.958 --> 28:31.029
I know this must be a little bit
shocking right now.

28:31.161 --> 28:33.118
That's an understatement.

28:33.242 --> 28:35.757
Whatever. No deal.
Cheetahs, we're out.

28:37.725 --> 28:38.875
What were we thinking?

28:39.006 --> 28:42.798
- I gave up a college prep class.
- I gave up teaching dance camp.

28:46.213 --> 28:49.206
Maybe the Cheetahs are over.

28:56.019 --> 28:57.374
All right

28:58.062 --> 28:59.177
Hey

29:09.431 --> 29:11.503
Oh, yeah

29:11.633 --> 29:13.704
We're standing on the edge
of something

29:13.834 --> 29:19.276
Do we stay or do we run?
It's obvious everything's changed

29:20.199 --> 29:24.515
My head can't seem to figure out
why my heart is full of doubt

29:24.643 --> 29:27.956
Maybe we're just tired of the game

29:28.086 --> 29:32.287
Guess you never know
what's going to happen

29:32.930 --> 29:36.608
So you do the best you can

29:36.733 --> 29:40.933
Following your soul
might bring you back

29:41.057 --> 29:44.893
Or it may have another plan

29:45.579 --> 29:50.418
Please don't let it fly away, high away

29:50.903 --> 29:54.582
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow

29:54.707 --> 29:58.942
Don't fly away, high away

29:59.070 --> 30:04.148
Please don't
Don't let it fly away

30:04.314 --> 30:08.596
We've never felt this place before
Wondering if any more

30:08.718 --> 30:12.031
We can find in us what it takes

30:12.922 --> 30:17.521
It's not about who's to blame
I pray that they're just growing pains

30:17.645 --> 30:20.798
Laughing while they're testing our faith

30:20.927 --> 30:24.890
'Cause you never know
what's going to happen

30:25.571 --> 30:29.454
So you do the best you can

30:29.575 --> 30:33.617
Following our souls
might bring us back

30:33.738 --> 30:38.293
Unless it has another plan, yeah, yeah

30:38.422 --> 30:42.977
Please don't let it fly away, high away

30:43.626 --> 30:47.224
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow

30:47.349 --> 30:51.665
Don't fly away, high away

30:51.793 --> 30:57.076
Please don't
Don't let it fly away

30:57.317 --> 31:00.516
It's yes, it's no
We stay, we go

31:00.639 --> 31:01.630
We go

31:01.761 --> 31:05.438
Feels like we're questioning
everything, yeah

31:06.005 --> 31:10.444
- We run, we fall, but through it all
- Through it all

31:10.567 --> 31:12.605
We never thought we would break

31:12.730 --> 31:15.404
We never thought we would break

31:15.531 --> 31:16.886
Please

31:17.734 --> 31:22.367
Please don't let it fly away, high away

31:23.098 --> 31:27.094
Gotta keep it together
Feel for the flow

31:27.341 --> 31:31.258
- Fly away
- High away

31:31.385 --> 31:34.105
- Please don't
- Please don't

31:34.226 --> 31:37.380
Don't let it fly away

31:47.517 --> 31:48.633
Thank you.

31:54.523 --> 31:56.356
So, what do you think?

31:57.085 --> 31:58.758
Cute earrings.

31:58.886 --> 32:01.357
No, about the whole auditioning thing.

32:01.489 --> 32:04.050
I don't know. What do you think?

32:04.170 --> 32:05.286
I think it stinks.

32:05.411 --> 32:07.928
What? This colour is perfect on you.

32:08.054 --> 32:09.488
Aqua, the audition.

32:09.615 --> 32:11.608
Yeah, it does.

32:11.737 --> 32:16.178
I mean, they can't really expect us to
audition against each other, can they?

32:20.783 --> 32:23.425
Look, I'm really sorry for
getting us into this mess.

32:24.427 --> 32:26.579
And, Do, you should take the part.

32:26.709 --> 32:28.826
Come on, you actually
turned down a job for this,

32:28.950 --> 32:31.387
and you really need the money.

32:31.513 --> 32:33.709
No, Aqua should do it.

32:33.834 --> 32:37.386
This is an awesome opportunity,
and you're an amazing actress.

32:37.517 --> 32:40.113
No. Vik clearly wants Chanel.

32:40.239 --> 32:41.310
What?

32:41.441 --> 32:44.161
"What?" He barely even looks
at us when you're around.

32:44.283 --> 32:46.355
That is so not true.
And even if that were true,

32:46.485 --> 32:49.399
I would never use that to get
an unfair advantage over my girls.

32:50.247 --> 32:53.481
Look, seriously, we could all do this.

32:53.610 --> 32:56.650
This is an opportunity of a lifetime.
How could we pass this up?

32:58.094 --> 33:00.325
Okay. I think we should audition.

33:00.695 --> 33:03.496
- Fair and square, Cheetah-style.
- Yes.

33:05.099 --> 33:07.741
That's weird, there's no caller ID.
Hello?

33:08.782 --> 33:12.300
Aqua? This is Kevin from
Totally Tech Support.

33:12.425 --> 33:13.654
Kevin 347.

33:13.786 --> 33:18.068
You guys, it's Kevin 347.
He's never called me before.

33:18.190 --> 33:19.829
What? What are you doing, girl?
Talk to him.

33:19.951 --> 33:21.022
Hi. Hello?

33:21.153 --> 33:22.553
I hope it's okay that I'm calling.

33:22.674 --> 33:25.587
I was just following up
on your computer problem.

33:25.715 --> 33:28.630
You were right.
I just needed to defrag the disc,

33:28.758 --> 33:30.238
and replace the corrupted registry file

33:30.359 --> 33:33.559
and reload the 802.11 B driver,
and it was fine.

33:33.682 --> 33:35.560
Now I'm officially impressed.

33:35.683 --> 33:38.075
I knew you really didn't need my help.

33:38.206 --> 33:40.767
Is that the only reason why you called?

33:41.249 --> 33:43.764
Not entirely. Are you busy?

33:43.890 --> 33:47.569
- No. I'm not doing anything.
- Me, neither.

33:47.694 --> 33:51.815
I mean, other than looking at the most
beautiful sunset I've ever seen.

33:52.377 --> 33:53.936
It is beautiful.

33:55.459 --> 33:58.260
Wait a minute.
You're watching the sunset, too?

33:58.382 --> 33:59.338
That means...

33:59.463 --> 34:03.664
We're in the same time zone!
There's this beautiful temple.

34:03.786 --> 34:05.015
With white carved elephants?

34:05.147 --> 34:06.343
- Yes.
- Wait a minute.

34:06.469 --> 34:07.664
Describe exactly where you are.

34:07.790 --> 34:09.702
Okay. I'm on a gorgeous path...

34:09.831 --> 34:11.664
Along the Arabian Sea...

34:11.793 --> 34:13.625
And there are people out,
and they're holding hands.

34:13.754 --> 34:16.476
And there's an ice cream stand,
and it's called...

34:16.597 --> 34:17.587
Naturals?

34:17.717 --> 34:19.071
That's right!

34:25.083 --> 34:27.646
You didn't tell me
you were coming to India.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.962
You didn't tell me you lived in India.

34:31.049 --> 34:33.848
Wait, you don't sound like
you live in India.

34:34.811 --> 34:37.043
See, I watch a lot
of American television.

34:38.574 --> 34:39.893
Aqua?

34:40.014 --> 34:41.530
Kevin 347?

34:42.538 --> 34:43.572
Amar.

34:44.418 --> 34:47.413
Actually, I'm only Kevin at work.
No, really.

34:47.702 --> 34:49.181
This is him!

34:49.703 --> 34:51.661
Yo, I think we should
give our girl some privacy.

34:51.784 --> 34:54.859
No, I know how these long-distance
things end. I'm going to talk to her.

34:54.987 --> 34:55.944
What? Are you crazy?

34:56.069 --> 34:59.984
This is so romantic.
We are in India, anything can happen.

35:01.273 --> 35:02.308
Fine.

35:09.639 --> 35:12.873
Have you noticed that
every elephant looks at me?

35:14.523 --> 35:16.117
Are you serious? It's an elephant!

35:16.245 --> 35:17.439
No, I'm not kidding.

35:17.566 --> 35:19.319
It's like they're wanting
to tell me something.

35:19.447 --> 35:21.679
Okay, now.
The elephant is wanting to tell you

35:21.809 --> 35:24.530
that it's okay for your friends to flirt
and have some fun.

35:24.651 --> 35:27.008
It doesn't mean they're
going to abandon you.

35:27.133 --> 35:30.093
Good. Because this is our
last summer together.

35:30.215 --> 35:32.971
I'm really nervous things are going
to change when we go to college.

35:33.098 --> 35:37.174
Nothing is going to change.
We'll always be there for each other.

35:37.822 --> 35:39.415
- Okay.
- Hold up, this is Vik.

35:39.543 --> 35:40.498
I'm going to tell him about the audition.

35:40.623 --> 35:43.584
- But your...
- Hello? Hey, how are you?

35:51.313 --> 35:52.793
Having doubts?

35:53.194 --> 35:55.106
What, me? No.

35:57.478 --> 35:58.877
Maybe.

35:58.998 --> 36:03.120
Sometimes what we wish for
is not what we really need.

36:04.443 --> 36:09.077
Don't miss where you are now
because you're anxious for the future.

36:09.287 --> 36:10.515
Understand?

36:10.647 --> 36:13.289
But what if I'm afraid
of where I'm going?

36:14.371 --> 36:15.645
Look at this tree.

36:15.773 --> 36:20.087
The branches grow out to the sky,
but the trunk remains the same.

36:21.257 --> 36:22.976
Life brings changes,

36:23.618 --> 36:26.897
but the things that really matter
always stay with us.

36:27.502 --> 36:31.293
Yeah, well, I'm not really
a big fan of change.

36:32.305 --> 36:34.867
Change will take place
whether you like it or not.

36:35.587 --> 36:36.578
Yeah.

36:37.670 --> 36:41.825
I can see
you have been through a lot in life.

36:43.394 --> 36:48.108
So you know, when things are bad,
they don't stay that way.

36:51.521 --> 36:52.637
Here.

36:53.962 --> 36:55.078
Ganesh?

36:56.045 --> 36:59.517
He was supposed to remove obstacles.
Now we have more.

37:00.407 --> 37:02.240
Do you have anything else
that will help me?

37:02.370 --> 37:05.922
Oh, yes. I have just the thing.
Close your eyes.

37:10.655 --> 37:12.215
What was that for?

37:12.778 --> 37:13.927
Clarity.

37:15.741 --> 37:16.890
Clarity?

37:24.907 --> 37:27.298
- Too spicy?
- Are you kidding?

37:27.430 --> 37:30.789
This is like breakfast in Texas.
What's it called again?

37:30.913 --> 37:33.587
Chaat. Papri Chaat, actually.

37:35.075 --> 37:38.036
I like it. It's like Indian nachos.

37:38.158 --> 37:40.755
It's crunchy, with a little bit of kick.

37:41.921 --> 37:43.992
I love a girl that can handle her chillies.

37:44.123 --> 37:46.559
See, I bet you cannot find
this in New York.

37:46.685 --> 37:49.076
Well, maybe you could
bring me some?

37:51.529 --> 37:53.760
You know,
Columbia has one of the best

37:53.890 --> 37:56.566
Physics departments
in the whole world.

37:56.693 --> 37:59.732
My father would never agree to that.
It's all planned.

37:59.855 --> 38:02.497
I start at the Indian School of Business
in the fall.

38:03.618 --> 38:06.738
Can't you just tell him you want
to keep your options open?

38:07.662 --> 38:08.982
The only time I talk to my father

38:09.103 --> 38:11.539
is when I'm listening to him
telling me what to do.

38:11.665 --> 38:14.340
Sometimes I get frustrated
that I don't have as many options,

38:14.467 --> 38:17.746
but I think I'd be terrified
if I had as many as you do.

38:17.870 --> 38:20.945
The one thing my dad always told me
was to go after my dreams.

38:21.513 --> 38:24.109
So what's one of your dreams?

38:25.837 --> 38:27.669
To star in Vik's movie.

38:27.798 --> 38:29.869
So go for it. What's stopping you?

38:30.479 --> 38:32.359
It's a little bit more
complicated than that.

38:32.482 --> 38:36.114
I mean, there's only one role
and three Cheetahs want it.

38:43.610 --> 38:46.764
One, two, three, four...

38:47.734 --> 38:49.168
One and two.

38:50.857 --> 38:52.371
Three, four.

38:54.819 --> 38:56.732
All right, guys. We'll just take a break.

38:56.861 --> 38:58.215
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:59.903 --> 39:00.974
Bye!

39:04.427 --> 39:06.784
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine.

39:07.670 --> 39:08.785
Cool.

39:09.711 --> 39:11.590
You got to be kidding me.

39:12.434 --> 39:13.628
What?

39:13.754 --> 39:14.949
You can't even rehearse.

39:15.075 --> 39:17.717
Any time you're around her,
you act like a big dork.

39:17.838 --> 39:19.955
I do not act like a dork.

39:20.079 --> 39:21.070
Okay.

39:22.282 --> 39:23.874
Really? A dork?

39:24.763 --> 39:26.244
Well, a little.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.958
No, that's a lie. A lot.

39:28.086 --> 39:29.805
You act like a huge dork around her.

39:29.927 --> 39:32.398
I know! It's just that I get so...

39:33.690 --> 39:35.283
So nervous around her.

39:35.411 --> 39:37.530
Why? You're the big movie star.

39:38.814 --> 39:41.206
Because I've never felt this way before.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.454
Yeah, well,
that's the oldest line in the book.

39:43.578 --> 39:46.049
- I've heard it before.
- I mean it.

39:46.181 --> 39:48.571
I've never even kissed a girl. Ever.

39:49.383 --> 39:50.613
Seriously?

39:51.225 --> 39:53.900
No, but I've seen you kiss.
In your movies.

39:54.027 --> 39:57.943
Yes. On camera, but never for real.
Not off camera.

39:59.111 --> 40:01.468
That's actually kind of romantic.

40:01.753 --> 40:02.823
It is?

40:03.434 --> 40:05.587
Dorinda, would you help me?

40:06.157 --> 40:07.146
What?

40:07.278 --> 40:10.032
Help me not act like such a dork
around Gita.

40:12.081 --> 40:13.960
You really like her, huh?

40:16.965 --> 40:20.084
No, sorry. Crushes lead to boyfriends,
and boyfriends lead to heartache.

40:20.207 --> 40:22.326
- You're on your own, buddy.
- Hey.

40:22.450 --> 40:26.366
If you help me with Gita,
I promise to help you with the audition.

40:28.654 --> 40:30.088
I don't know.

40:30.737 --> 40:32.217
I've seen you dance.

40:32.338 --> 40:35.251
I can help you show the world
what you can do.

40:37.702 --> 40:41.983
- You're rewriting it again?
- It was either rewrite the script or

40:43.346 --> 40:47.263
"Vik Bhatia, dental school,"
as Uncle likes to say.

40:47.390 --> 40:50.224
Well, I guess if that's what it takes
to get your movie made.

40:50.351 --> 40:53.710
I know what you're thinking,
but this is my one shot.

40:53.834 --> 40:55.668
And, yes,
if I have to make some compromises,

40:55.797 --> 40:58.187
at least I get a shot at my dream.

40:59.199 --> 41:01.556
What if this was your
only shot to be a star?

41:01.681 --> 41:04.800
Don't you think you'd give it
everything you've got?

41:04.923 --> 41:08.202
I mean, how could you
spend the rest of your life

41:08.967 --> 41:11.881
wondering if you really
could've made it?

41:16.373 --> 41:18.683
Well, I have to get back to writing.

41:18.814 --> 41:19.804
- All right.
- See you later.

41:19.935 --> 41:21.006
Yeah.

41:32.706 --> 41:36.497
Maybe this was meant to be

41:38.150 --> 41:41.748
Maybe now it should be me

41:41.873 --> 41:43.945
Been dreaming of this forever

41:44.075 --> 41:48.390
But I'm feeling so confused, yeah

41:48.558 --> 41:51.473
It's hard to see what's right
between you and I

41:51.601 --> 41:53.878
And I don't know what to do

41:54.003 --> 41:59.843
Oh, we'd stay together always
is the promise we made

41:59.967 --> 42:02.643
But suddenly it's not so clear

42:02.770 --> 42:05.410
And I'm being pulled both ways

42:05.533 --> 42:08.332
And it's breaking my heart
Tearing me apart

42:08.454 --> 42:11.449
It's impossible to choose

42:11.577 --> 42:14.218
What if I don't try?

42:14.339 --> 42:16.696
What if I do?

42:16.821 --> 42:19.496
Everything that I've dreamed
is right in front of me

42:19.623 --> 42:22.663
If I win, what would I lose?

42:22.786 --> 42:25.826
How could I learn to live

42:25.949 --> 42:29.864
Wondering what if?

42:34.595 --> 42:39.957
Things would never be the same
Oh, no

42:40.239 --> 42:43.598
Maybe that's the price of fame

42:43.722 --> 42:45.681
Been waiting for this forever

42:45.805 --> 42:49.846
It's close enough for me to touch

42:49.967 --> 42:53.042
But if I don't go for it
I might always regret

42:53.170 --> 42:55.733
But is it worth us breaking up?

42:55.853 --> 43:00.851
Oh, we'd stay together always
is the promise we made

43:01.857 --> 43:04.498
But suddenly it's not so clear

43:04.619 --> 43:07.216
And I don't know what to say

43:07.342 --> 43:10.176
And it's breaking my heart
Tearing me apart

43:10.303 --> 43:13.218
It's impossible to choose

43:13.346 --> 43:16.068
What if I don't try?

43:16.189 --> 43:18.545
What if I do?

43:18.670 --> 43:21.392
Everything that I've dreamed
is right in front of me

43:21.513 --> 43:24.507
If I win, what would I lose?

43:24.635 --> 43:29.315
How could I learn to live, wondering

43:29.919 --> 43:32.641
What if I would've tried?
I can shine, even fly

43:32.762 --> 43:37.442
I don't wanna realise
after it's too late, no

43:38.286 --> 43:41.122
And see it all pass me by

43:41.249 --> 43:43.924
If I do, if I don't
Will I ever really know

43:44.051 --> 43:48.047
What the future could hold
before it slips away?

43:49.495 --> 43:53.731
Could be the chance of a lifetime

44:03.586 --> 44:06.387
And it's breaking my heart
Tearing me apart

44:06.509 --> 44:09.583
It's impossible to choose

44:09.711 --> 44:12.353
What if I don't try?

44:12.474 --> 44:14.784
What if I do?

44:14.915 --> 44:17.591
Everything that I dreamed
is right in front of me

44:17.718 --> 44:20.713
If I win, what would I lose?

44:20.841 --> 44:25.361
How could I learn to live, wondering

44:25.485 --> 44:29.082
What if?

44:29.207 --> 44:30.483
Chanel!

44:30.609 --> 44:34.081
I never wanna say

44:34.211 --> 44:36.932
"What if?"

44:42.098 --> 44:45.296
So, are you guys okay
auditioning against each other?

44:45.421 --> 44:48.859
Yeah. I mean, we're best friends,
and we completely trust each other.

44:48.983 --> 44:52.695
And no one's going to betray that
just to get a part in a movie.

44:52.866 --> 44:55.301
Wow, that's refreshing.

44:55.429 --> 44:58.149
Obviously, you've never worked
in Bollywood.

45:00.313 --> 45:03.705
- Do you want to be a star?
- Maybe, once.

45:03.835 --> 45:05.748
But I don't think I could ever be a star.

45:05.877 --> 45:10.031
I just love performing.
Acting, singing, dancing.

45:10.159 --> 45:12.835
I've always loved to dance.

45:12.962 --> 45:16.560
- You have to try this on.
- I could never pull that off.

45:16.685 --> 45:18.278
Just something plain for me.

45:19.807 --> 45:21.162
He's here.

45:26.813 --> 45:29.488
Gita, is that
what you were worried about?

45:31.457 --> 45:36.376
- It's okay. I know you like him.
- Yeah, so what?

45:36.501 --> 45:40.657
He would never want to go out with me.
Like I said, I'm not a movie star.

45:40.785 --> 45:42.663
That doesn't matter.

45:42.786 --> 45:45.349
And besides,
when you're on that dance floor,

45:45.469 --> 45:47.665
it's pretty clear that you are a star.

45:47.790 --> 45:50.307
You don't need a guy to tell you that.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.807
Are you sure he invited me?

46:14.931 --> 46:18.006
Of course. It's not like it's a date
or something.

46:21.097 --> 46:24.978
Do I look okay? 'Cause, like,
I could totally go home and change.

46:26.501 --> 46:27.776
Yeah.

46:29.903 --> 46:32.261
- So glad you could make it.
- Hey.

46:32.426 --> 46:33.826
Wouldn't miss it.

46:33.947 --> 46:36.908
Hey, listen, I'm really sorry
about the whole mess with my uncle.

46:37.030 --> 46:40.343
- Look, I totally understand.
- You do?

46:40.473 --> 46:41.701
Yeah. Well, I know you'll figure it out,

46:41.833 --> 46:43.951
and you'll make the movie
you want to make.

46:44.075 --> 46:45.226
Come on.

46:49.119 --> 46:51.794
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

46:52.522 --> 46:55.483
In this one. By myself.

46:58.847 --> 47:01.409
Feels like love

47:01.529 --> 47:03.965
Feels like love

47:04.091 --> 47:07.245
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

47:07.374 --> 47:10.173
You got me spinning now

47:10.297 --> 47:12.607
I feel your happiness all around

47:12.738 --> 47:15.778
I'm not sure what I'm getting into

47:15.901 --> 47:18.052
Feels like love

47:18.222 --> 47:20.785
We're not the same, everybody knows

47:20.905 --> 47:23.340
That's the best thing about us, though

47:23.466 --> 47:26.267
So hard to believe it, but it's true

47:26.389 --> 47:28.301
Feels like love

47:28.430 --> 47:30.663
We see the world in different ways

47:30.793 --> 47:34.071
But I'm loving every minute
of every day

47:34.195 --> 47:37.474
Against the odds, we'll make it through

47:37.598 --> 47:42.232
Maybe this could be
more than just fun

47:42.802 --> 47:47.596
This could be everything that I want

47:47.726 --> 47:50.289
What's happening to me?

47:50.409 --> 47:53.288
Could you be the one?

47:53.410 --> 47:58.408
This could be everything that I want

47:59.415 --> 48:01.978
I didn't know how good it could be

48:02.098 --> 48:06.379
And it feels like love to me

48:06.942 --> 48:09.457
Feels like love

48:09.583 --> 48:12.100
Feels like love

48:12.226 --> 48:14.661
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

48:15.107 --> 48:18.068
I didn't know I could feel this way

48:18.190 --> 48:21.105
It's a new world, maybe that's okay

48:21.233 --> 48:23.829
You're like a part of me I never knew

48:23.995 --> 48:26.352
Feels like love

48:26.477 --> 48:28.947
You're the one I need next to me

48:29.079 --> 48:31.470
But I know that it's hard to be

48:31.601 --> 48:34.322
Living for everybody else but you

48:34.443 --> 48:36.197
Feels like love

48:36.886 --> 48:39.276
Real love's not supposed to be

48:39.407 --> 48:41.878
Afraid of what everybody thinks

48:42.010 --> 48:45.642
So let's show them all
what we can do

48:45.773 --> 48:49.654
Maybe this could be
more than just fun

48:49.775 --> 48:50.892
More than just fun

48:51.017 --> 48:54.409
This could be everything that I want

48:54.899 --> 48:56.016
Everything that I want

48:56.141 --> 48:58.372
What's happening to me?

48:58.503 --> 49:01.338
- Could you be the one?
- Could you be the one?

49:01.465 --> 49:05.906
This could be everything that I want

49:07.510 --> 49:10.311
I didn't know how good it could be

49:10.433 --> 49:13.984
It feels like love to me

49:18.519 --> 49:21.513
I've got to say it now

49:21.641 --> 49:23.599
Seems too hard to do this

49:23.723 --> 49:26.558
We're gonna work it out

49:26.846 --> 49:29.202
Nothing about us makes sense

49:29.327 --> 49:33.289
I'd build a bridge from where I am
to where you are

49:35.051 --> 49:38.604
It shouldn't have to be this hard

49:40.737 --> 49:45.132
Maybe this could be
more than just fun

49:46.021 --> 49:49.811
This could be everything that I want

49:49.943 --> 49:50.980
Everything that I want

49:51.105 --> 49:53.462
What's happening to me?

49:53.587 --> 49:56.501
- Could you be the one?
- The one I love

49:56.629 --> 50:00.592
This could be everything that I want

50:00.833 --> 50:02.472
Oh, yeah

50:02.594 --> 50:05.191
- I didn't know how good it could be
- No, no

50:05.317 --> 50:08.116
And it feels like love to me

50:08.238 --> 50:10.036
Like love to me

50:10.161 --> 50:12.676
Feels like love

50:12.802 --> 50:15.842
Feels like love

50:15.965 --> 50:19.437
It feels like love to me

50:20.649 --> 50:23.118
- Feels like love
- Like love

50:23.250 --> 50:24.445
Feels like love

50:24.571 --> 50:26.370
Feels like love

50:26.493 --> 50:30.649
It feels like love to me

50:46.189 --> 50:50.505
So, what do you think?
Isn't it fantastic?

50:53.995 --> 50:55.953
This isn't my wedding set.

50:59.159 --> 51:04.362
Where are the flowers?
Where's the set dressing?

51:17.134 --> 51:20.334
Vik, talk to your uncle.

51:21.257 --> 51:24.535
He said this is what we could afford.

51:24.659 --> 51:27.574
See this chair? We got it for free.

51:27.702 --> 51:30.424
Your uncle sure hates
to pass up a bargain.

51:37.830 --> 51:39.150
Tell me about it.

51:39.951 --> 51:41.706
I just need one minute.

51:41.834 --> 51:48.152
Okay, look, Uncle-ji,
it's just not what I had in mind.

51:49.319 --> 51:51.391
- None of it is.
- Viku, beta.

51:52.002 --> 51:57.876
You need to learn some things
about how real world works.

51:58.246 --> 52:01.799
I went to film school, Uncle.
NYU. I won awards.

52:02.130 --> 52:04.691
- I know how to do this.
- Oh, really?

52:04.811 --> 52:07.567
You are already over the budget
and under the schedule.

52:07.694 --> 52:10.131
You won awards for that also in NYU?

52:10.257 --> 52:12.567
Look, I just need some more time.

52:12.698 --> 52:15.659
Time is one thing you don't have.
Another thing is money.

52:15.781 --> 52:19.253
So if you don't start
shooting next week,

52:19.383 --> 52:22.981
I'm pulling plug
on American Girl in India.

52:23.106 --> 52:26.659
Actually, you re-titled it
Kamal Bhatia's Namaste Bombay.

52:26.790 --> 52:31.150
Correct. And if you don't fix it,
I'm going to re-title it

52:31.273 --> 52:35.270
Vik Bhatia's Bye-bye, Bombay,
Hello, Dental School.

52:35.477 --> 52:38.117
Actually, your name has
a nice ring to it.

52:41.241 --> 52:43.837
Kamal Uncle, the palace set is a wreck.

52:43.963 --> 52:45.364
I can't have it ready in a week.

52:45.485 --> 52:47.044
- What about a location?
- What about?

52:47.166 --> 52:51.003
If it's free, okay.
Otherwise, movie is over. And...

52:54.251 --> 52:58.771
You think about how many cavities
you're going to have to drill

52:58.895 --> 53:01.651
to pay back
what you have spent already!

53:01.778 --> 53:02.767
Okay.

53:06.982 --> 53:08.097
No set?

53:09.903 --> 53:12.420
I guess this weekend's auditions
are off.

53:12.546 --> 53:13.946
Guess you heard.

53:14.067 --> 53:18.143
I can't possibly find a location
in a week, let alone for free.

53:19.071 --> 53:21.143
Uncle is going to shut down the movie
for sure.

53:21.273 --> 53:23.345
Time to book our flights home.

53:24.395 --> 53:27.993
You can't go home yet.
You haven't seen anything of India.

53:28.118 --> 53:30.316
Come home with me for Holi.
It's my favourite holiday.

53:30.441 --> 53:32.717
In fact, you're all invited.

53:33.683 --> 53:36.723
- What's Holi?
- It's the festival of colours.

53:36.846 --> 53:40.285
I can't go. I only have a week
to audition, rehearse,

53:40.409 --> 53:41.398
and find a location.

53:41.529 --> 53:46.004
Vik, trust me, Rajasthan is
the best place to find a location.

53:46.133 --> 53:47.283
The village that my parents live in

53:47.414 --> 53:50.011
is a hundred times more beautiful
than any movie set.

53:50.137 --> 53:52.413
And I just might have a palace for you.

53:52.538 --> 53:56.250
Yeah, you can audition, rehearse.
I'll take care of everything.

53:57.262 --> 53:59.938
Wow. Thank you?

54:01.746 --> 54:03.783
How exciting! Cheetah road trip.

54:03.907 --> 54:06.868
Viku, what you are doing sitting
talking to ladies?

54:06.990 --> 54:09.221
You have no set and only one week.

54:09.791 --> 54:15.190
We're just making a plan
to do some location scouting.

54:15.317 --> 54:17.673
Location scouting? What do you know
about location scouting?

54:17.798 --> 54:18.788
I'm coming with you.

54:25.405 --> 54:30.722
- See you later, Swami.
- Girls, don't forget to untie your strings!

54:31.650 --> 54:35.202
Looks like our strings
are going to be up there for a long time.

54:35.333 --> 54:37.894
Look, I don't think our wishes
are going to come true.

54:38.014 --> 54:41.567
The tree is still working.
You must give it some time.

54:41.698 --> 54:44.008
Well, can you tell that tree
to get a move on it?

54:44.139 --> 54:45.574
For real. Like, we're running late.

54:45.701 --> 54:49.252
The point of time is
to help you understand where you are,

54:49.383 --> 54:52.139
not to make you rush
to the next place, understand?

54:52.266 --> 54:53.746
Not really. No.

54:53.867 --> 54:57.146
I have just the thing
that will help you see more clearly.

54:57.270 --> 55:00.185
Oh, no, no, no. No, we're good.
But thank you so much.

55:00.313 --> 55:02.623
- Okay, well, bye, Swami.
- Bye.

55:45.189 --> 55:46.258
Hello?

55:49.591 --> 55:55.433
No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Sorry.
No, no, no, 15%.

55:56.397 --> 55:59.152
So why did you want
to be a director, anyway?

56:00.561 --> 56:03.680
When I was a kid, my parents used
to take me to see movies,

56:03.803 --> 56:04.794
like, all the time.

56:04.925 --> 56:06.439
And sometimes
you'd go see Uncle films,

56:06.566 --> 56:11.165
and it was the most amazing thing
to think that he made all that happen.

56:11.289 --> 56:14.044
He created those great stories.

56:14.171 --> 56:17.564
And now when I write a script,
it's like I can see the movie in my head.

56:17.694 --> 56:21.532
It's like I've met the characters
and I've been to the places.

56:22.698 --> 56:26.615
I want the whole world to see my films.

56:27.302 --> 56:30.741
I get it. It's like when I sing.
I, like, go somewhere else,

56:30.865 --> 56:33.745
- become somebody else.
- Yeah.

56:33.867 --> 56:36.430
It's the greatest feeling in the world.

56:37.750 --> 56:39.789
And I just want to share it.

57:07.134 --> 57:10.015
Do you see that?
That elephant is staring right at me.

57:10.137 --> 57:12.447
Don't worry.
My grandmother says it's good luck.

57:12.578 --> 57:15.334
- They're trying to help you.
- Like Ganesh?

57:15.461 --> 57:16.736
It's a sign.

57:17.542 --> 57:21.380
- You're lucky. They always ignore me.
- Really?

57:21.506 --> 57:23.737
Well, maybe my luck is changing.

57:29.671 --> 57:30.788
Or not.

58:22.714 --> 58:24.273
Glad you made it.

58:26.558 --> 58:28.470
Did they just get married?

58:28.599 --> 58:31.514
No. If this was a wedding,
he'd be riding a horse.

58:45.973 --> 58:50.846
- Is that your palace?
- Don't be ridiculous. It's my parents'.

58:52.178 --> 58:53.771
Oh, my. Oh, my.

59:00.905 --> 59:03.023
Why didn't you mention any of this?

59:03.147 --> 59:05.902
Were you just playing a joke
on the smart girl

59:06.029 --> 59:08.989
who's too dumb to realise
you're a maharajah?

59:09.111 --> 59:13.666
I am no such thing,
technically, until my grandfather dies.

59:14.757 --> 59:16.589
You should have told me.

59:17.838 --> 59:21.801
Okay, I'm sorry,
but it doesn't change anything.

59:22.802 --> 59:24.841
If anything,
it makes my life more difficult.

59:24.965 --> 59:26.718
It limits my options.

59:26.846 --> 59:28.075
- Really?
- Yeah.

59:28.207 --> 59:32.966
'Cause it seems to me
that you've got lots of options.

59:34.011 --> 59:35.526
Not like you.

59:35.653 --> 59:38.613
If the Cheetahs don't work out,
there are a million things you can do.

59:38.735 --> 59:40.853
You can make your own decisions.

59:41.858 --> 59:45.171
- I can never do that.
- Well, have you ever even tried?

59:46.502 --> 59:48.733
That's just not how things work
with my father.

59:48.863 --> 59:53.224
Amar, beta? It's time to eat.
Please tell your friends, beta.

59:55.749 --> 59:57.388
Ready? Come on.

01:00:00.753 --> 01:00:03.269
Seriously... So good.

01:00:03.395 --> 01:00:06.595
I'm sorry my husband is away
on business.

01:00:06.718 --> 01:00:09.074
But we are both so happy
that you are here

01:00:09.199 --> 01:00:11.432
celebrating the holiday with our family.

01:00:11.562 --> 01:00:13.474
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:00:13.603 --> 01:00:15.596
Personally, I had never imagined
the day

01:00:15.725 --> 01:00:20.086
that Rahim Khan and Kamal Bhatia
would be seated at our table.

01:00:20.809 --> 01:00:24.692
Most honoured. Most honoured.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

01:00:24.813 --> 01:00:26.212
And another small thing.

01:00:26.334 --> 01:00:29.886
I have prepared
all of Amar's favourite dishes tonight.

01:00:30.017 --> 01:00:32.578
So, Aqua, pay close attention.

01:00:33.499 --> 01:00:37.700
- Yeah, Aqua. Take notes.
- She's just being friendly.

01:00:37.822 --> 01:00:40.259
Yeah, right.
I think it's a little more than that.

01:00:40.385 --> 01:00:41.421
- Aqua?
- Yes.

01:00:41.546 --> 01:00:43.583
Did you try the chicken tikka masala?

01:00:43.707 --> 01:00:46.861
- Yeah. It's actually my favourite.
- Really?

01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:51.351
I make it every time Amar comes home.
I'll give you the recipe later, okay?

01:00:51.474 --> 01:00:52.702
Okay.

01:00:52.834 --> 01:00:55.226
Don't worry.
She did this to his last girlfriend, too.

01:00:56.398 --> 01:00:57.433
- What?
- Thank you.

01:00:57.558 --> 01:00:58.674
She did.

01:01:01.922 --> 01:01:06.681
- I'm not his girlfriend.
- Not yet, anyway.

01:01:07.326 --> 01:01:08.965
This is seriously incredible.

01:01:09.087 --> 01:01:11.684
It's just like the palace
in Namaste Bombay.

01:01:11.810 --> 01:01:13.608
I mean, I wouldn't ask
if this wasn't crucial or anything,

01:01:13.731 --> 01:01:16.487
but is there any way
that we could shoot here?

01:01:16.614 --> 01:01:19.334
I don't think my mom
would let Rahim leave, even if he tried.

01:01:19.455 --> 01:01:20.572
I'm sure she'd be thrilled.

01:01:20.697 --> 01:01:23.008
- I hope so.
- One thing.

01:01:23.139 --> 01:01:26.418
For the guy that saved my movie?
Anything. You name it.

01:01:32.146 --> 01:01:34.982
Guess who the newest member
of the movie crew is?

01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:37.944
What? You're in the movie now?

01:01:39.111 --> 01:01:42.823
Well, not really.
But I am the new location owner.

01:01:43.675 --> 01:01:45.793
Well, congratulations.

01:01:45.917 --> 01:01:49.229
- There is just one condition.
- What's that?

01:01:49.359 --> 01:01:52.115
- That he casts you in the lead.
- What?

01:01:52.242 --> 01:01:53.517
Don't worry about Kamal Uncle.

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:57.559
I think I have a bit more pull
now that I am the new location owner.

01:02:18.823 --> 01:02:21.784
Please tell me you're not doing
what I think you're doing.

01:02:21.906 --> 01:02:27.621
- I was just rehearsing.
- The love duet? By yourself?

01:02:28.991 --> 01:02:31.189
How long are you going
to keep running away?

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.909
How long do I have?

01:02:34.035 --> 01:02:37.269
Do you really want to spend the rest
of your life doing half the dance?

01:02:37.398 --> 01:02:39.835
What am I supposed to do?
I act like a total fool in front of her.

01:02:39.961 --> 01:02:42.430
It doesn't matter. None of this matters.

01:02:42.562 --> 01:02:43.837
Look, if you really care about her,

01:02:43.963 --> 01:02:46.878
you have to be willing
to take the chance.

01:02:47.006 --> 01:02:50.365
No more dancing in archways
or hiding behind fake doors.

01:02:50.489 --> 01:02:51.843
None of that.

01:02:58.415 --> 01:03:01.774
You give pretty good advice.
Ever take it yourself?

01:03:06.502 --> 01:03:08.494
Wait. What is that?

01:03:08.703 --> 01:03:13.178
- See, I told you.
- Wow, you were right. This is amazing.

01:03:17.590 --> 01:03:19.629
I thought they said
they were going to play fair.

01:03:19.753 --> 01:03:22.827
Who, Chanel and Vik?
They're a couple, aren't they?

01:03:25.237 --> 01:03:28.470
- They are?
- Well, everyone kind of thinks they are.

01:03:30.321 --> 01:03:32.199
Why wouldn't she tell me?

01:03:34.163 --> 01:03:35.518
Maybe she didn't want you to know

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:39.083
so that if she gets the part,
you would think it was fair.

01:03:45.373 --> 01:03:48.014
So, think this would be a good place
for the wedding scene?

01:03:48.135 --> 01:03:50.605
Totally. This is incredibly romantic.

01:03:53.459 --> 01:03:55.338
Don't even get any ideas.

01:03:55.461 --> 01:03:58.216
The girls and I already talked about it.
No unfair advantages.

01:03:58.343 --> 01:03:59.332
Okay.

01:04:00.265 --> 01:04:02.257
So, is Amar going
to let you shoot here?

01:04:02.386 --> 01:04:05.267
- Yeah. He said I could.
- Hot.

01:04:05.389 --> 01:04:07.780
But only if I cast Aqua as the lead.

01:04:10.273 --> 01:04:12.948
Don't worry.
I told him it wasn't up to me.

01:04:14.035 --> 01:04:16.074
But we promised each other.

01:04:16.838 --> 01:04:19.228
Seems like you're the only one
keeping that promise.

01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:20.919
The other Cheetahs,

01:04:21.042 --> 01:04:23.318
they're not letting anything stand
in their way.

01:04:24.363 --> 01:04:25.320
Look, I gotta turn in.

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:28.405
I have to meet Rahim and Dorinda
for dance rehearsal tomorrow morning.

01:04:28.527 --> 01:04:30.645
Dorinda? Why is she rehearsing
with Rahim?

01:04:31.330 --> 01:04:32.889
He's helping her get ready
for the audition.

01:04:33.011 --> 01:04:34.810
What?

01:04:34.933 --> 01:04:38.405
I keep telling you,
you're the only one who's playing fair.

01:04:41.098 --> 01:04:42.817
Catch you later. Okay?

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:50.015
So what can I do
to be more comfortable around Gita?

01:04:50.145 --> 01:04:51.704
You gotta tell her how you feel.

01:04:51.826 --> 01:04:54.057
But rehearsing with her
would be a start.

01:04:54.187 --> 01:04:55.304
I can't.

01:04:58.871 --> 01:05:02.150
They look good together.
We should choose the dancer.

01:05:03.355 --> 01:05:06.316
But, Uncle, you've really got to listen
to Chanel sing.

01:05:06.438 --> 01:05:08.270
I truly believe that she's the one.

01:05:17.046 --> 01:05:18.082
Okay.

01:05:45.069 --> 01:05:48.427
- What is that?
- My string.

01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:50.426
From the wishing tree?

01:05:51.154 --> 01:05:53.271
But our wish hasn't even come true yet.

01:05:53.395 --> 01:05:56.629
- Mine did.
- No, the... Wait.

01:05:56.758 --> 01:05:59.514
I wished for the Cheetah Girls
to become the biggest movie stars.

01:05:59.641 --> 01:06:01.121
What did you wish for?

01:06:01.242 --> 01:06:02.801
I wished for the Cheetahs
to stay the same,

01:06:02.923 --> 01:06:04.276
the way we've always been.

01:06:04.405 --> 01:06:05.758
Thanks for cancelling out my wish.

01:06:05.885 --> 01:06:08.117
Sorry, I didn't want our group
to break up.

01:06:08.247 --> 01:06:09.523
Well, that still leaves Aqua.

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:14.369
I wished that I would meet Kevin 347
in person.

01:06:15.053 --> 01:06:16.089
Nice.

01:06:16.894 --> 01:06:19.536
Did you also wish for your boyfriend
to buy your way into the movie?

01:06:19.657 --> 01:06:22.731
- What? I would never!
- Yeah. Spare us.

01:06:22.859 --> 01:06:24.212
Like you're any better?

01:06:24.341 --> 01:06:25.980
I couldn't pry you off of Rahim
with a crowbar.

01:06:26.102 --> 01:06:27.091
Really? Coming from the girl

01:06:27.222 --> 01:06:28.815
who wouldn't bat an eyelash
at our director?

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.060
- I didn't have to.
- Yeah, all right.

01:06:30.185 --> 01:06:31.106
Whatever.

01:06:31.106 --> 01:06:31.379
Whatever.

01:06:31.506 --> 01:06:34.180
Excuse me, ladies. Who is first?

01:06:42.795 --> 01:06:44.069
I'm the one

01:06:45.037 --> 01:06:46.596
Oh, yeah

01:06:54.003 --> 01:06:55.563
Come on

01:06:56.406 --> 01:06:58.967
Nobody can sing like me

01:06:59.087 --> 01:07:01.001
I can hit any note you give for me

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:05.251
From A to Z
Yes, I can

01:07:05.373 --> 01:07:07.889
Nobody can dance like me

01:07:08.015 --> 01:07:09.769
I can move to the beat you're playing

01:07:09.897 --> 01:07:13.938
Baby, with my feet
Yeah, yeah

01:07:14.059 --> 01:07:17.020
Nobody can act like me

01:07:17.142 --> 01:07:20.900
I can fall to pieces
and make you believe

01:07:21.026 --> 01:07:23.746
In almost anything

01:07:23.867 --> 01:07:25.507
I'm the one

01:07:25.629 --> 01:07:28.304
I'm stepping out
and breaking all the rules

01:07:28.431 --> 01:07:30.151
All alone

01:07:30.273 --> 01:07:32.789
I'm gonna show everybody
what I can do

01:07:32.915 --> 01:07:34.714
I'm the one

01:07:34.837 --> 01:07:35.953
Put your bet on me

01:07:36.078 --> 01:07:39.196
Can't you see that I'm the one?

01:07:39.321 --> 01:07:41.677
Don't need anybody now
I'm making it on my own

01:07:41.802 --> 01:07:43.600
Got a voice like an angel

01:07:43.723 --> 01:07:47.959
She can turn every word
into a lovely melody

01:07:48.607 --> 01:07:49.837
Yes, she can

01:07:49.969 --> 01:07:52.086
The girl's got her own groove

01:07:52.771 --> 01:07:57.052
Put the music on and watch her
as she does her thing

01:07:57.735 --> 01:07:58.690
She can do everything

01:07:58.815 --> 01:08:01.491
My girl is a drama queen

01:08:02.058 --> 01:08:05.941
Any role you give her,
she does perfectly

01:08:07.302 --> 01:08:08.702
Oh, can't you see that

01:08:08.823 --> 01:08:10.338
She's the one?

01:08:10.465 --> 01:08:13.140
She's stepping out
and breaking all the rules

01:08:13.267 --> 01:08:14.987
All alone

01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:17.419
She's gonna show everybody
what she can do

01:08:17.551 --> 01:08:19.589
She's the one

01:08:19.712 --> 01:08:20.863
Put your bet on her

01:08:20.993 --> 01:08:23.907
Can't you see that she's the one?

01:08:24.035 --> 01:08:26.996
She don't need anybody now
She's making it on her own

01:08:27.398 --> 01:08:33.035
I wanna be the one
who everybody notices

01:08:33.162 --> 01:08:35.839
I'm stepping out, stepping out, all right

01:08:36.326 --> 01:08:41.688
I wanna be the one
who's always front and centre

01:08:42.050 --> 01:08:44.121
For the first time in my life

01:08:44.573 --> 01:08:46.292
I'm the one

01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:48.929
I'm stepping out
and breaking all the rules

01:08:49.055 --> 01:08:50.694
All alone

01:08:50.818 --> 01:08:53.412
I'm gonna show everybody
what I can do

01:08:53.538 --> 01:08:55.292
I'm the one

01:08:55.421 --> 01:08:56.571
Put your bet on me

01:08:56.702 --> 01:08:59.822
Can't you see that I'm the one?

01:08:59.944 --> 01:09:02.541
Don't need anybody now
I'm making it on my own

01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:04.100
I'm the one

01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:06.823
I'm stepping out
and breaking all the rules

01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:08.542
All alone

01:09:08.671 --> 01:09:11.313
I'm gonna show everybody
what I can do

01:09:11.434 --> 01:09:13.232
I'm the one

01:09:13.354 --> 01:09:14.506
Put your bet on me

01:09:14.636 --> 01:09:17.711
Can't you see that I'm the one?

01:09:17.839 --> 01:09:20.435
Don't need anybody now
I'm making it on my own

01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:22.041
I'm the one

01:09:27.487 --> 01:09:30.880
Wonderful, wonderful. Wonderful.

01:09:31.010 --> 01:09:35.689
Now, I can see why you wanted
to choose all three. Wonderful.

01:09:35.814 --> 01:09:39.446
But we still cannot afford it.

01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:43.769
So role goes to...

01:09:47.341 --> 01:09:50.018
- Chanel.
- Yes, girls. Yes.

01:09:50.866 --> 01:09:52.219
Big surprise.

01:09:53.067 --> 01:09:56.107
Yeah, congratulations.
Fair and square, right?

01:09:59.113 --> 01:10:00.341
Thank you, Uncle-ji.

01:10:09.721 --> 01:10:11.440
Congratulations, Chanel.

01:10:14.605 --> 01:10:15.925
Thanks.

01:10:41.186 --> 01:10:45.546
I could be recognised from a distance

01:10:46.310 --> 01:10:50.625
Yeah, I could be the biggest name
on the screen

01:10:51.074 --> 01:10:53.669
Singing and dancing forever

01:10:53.795 --> 01:10:55.993
Signing my name for whoever

01:10:56.598 --> 01:11:00.560
Yeah, it's all in my reach, yeah

01:11:00.681 --> 01:11:03.436
If I give it all that I've got

01:11:03.563 --> 01:11:05.796
I get there to the top

01:11:05.926 --> 01:11:08.282
But I don't even wanna go

01:11:08.407 --> 01:11:11.129
If I have to go there alone, so

01:11:11.370 --> 01:11:15.048
Set me on top of that mountain

01:11:15.173 --> 01:11:20.297
Let me fly to the end
of the world

01:11:21.018 --> 01:11:24.411
Yeah, I can go anywhere

01:11:24.581 --> 01:11:26.971
But if you're not with me there

01:11:27.743 --> 01:11:30.339
It'll never be enough

01:11:30.625 --> 01:11:35.225
There's no place like us

01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:37.742
There's no place like us

01:11:37.911 --> 01:11:42.352
If I find the other side of the rainbow

01:11:43.075 --> 01:11:46.866
Will I find that the gold
ain't worth any price?

01:11:47.799 --> 01:11:50.440
'Cause if we ain't there for each other

01:11:50.561 --> 01:11:53.077
Then all I got doesn't matter

01:11:53.363 --> 01:11:57.360
No, it won't be right to

01:11:57.847 --> 01:12:00.124
Give it all that I got

01:12:00.249 --> 01:12:02.526
And get there to the top

01:12:02.651 --> 01:12:04.564
If you're not up there with me

01:12:05.333 --> 01:12:08.088
There's nothing I wanna see, so

01:12:08.215 --> 01:12:11.813
Set me on top of that mountain

01:12:11.938 --> 01:12:18.178
Let me fly to the end
of the world, yeah

01:12:18.503 --> 01:12:21.304
I can go anywhere

01:12:21.426 --> 01:12:23.657
But if you're not with me there

01:12:24.469 --> 01:12:27.303
It'll never be enough

01:12:27.431 --> 01:12:30.824
There's no place like us

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.269
There's no place like us

01:12:35.077 --> 01:12:37.593
It doesn't matter where we are

01:12:37.719 --> 01:12:40.155
Or matter how far

01:12:40.281 --> 01:12:42.513
'Cause even when we go
our separate ways

01:12:42.883 --> 01:12:44.682
We'll be the place

01:12:45.525 --> 01:12:47.836
I believe that I can do it

01:12:47.967 --> 01:12:50.039
But alone, I won't get through it

01:12:50.609 --> 01:12:52.647
We know we gotta stick together

01:12:52.771 --> 01:12:55.367
'Cause no matter what

01:12:55.493 --> 01:12:58.967
There's no place like us

01:13:03.939 --> 01:13:05.215
You were great.

01:13:05.341 --> 01:13:08.380
I'm sorry about what I said.
I didn't mean any of it.

01:13:08.503 --> 01:13:11.703
Me, too. You sang your heart out.

01:13:11.826 --> 01:13:14.263
Thanks. We were all great.

01:13:14.829 --> 01:13:17.789
Look, it doesn't matter what happens,
where we go or what we do.

01:13:17.911 --> 01:13:21.429
Change is inevitable,
but we'll always be Cheetahs.

01:13:22.154 --> 01:13:24.546
Cheetahs, say it like you mean it.

01:13:24.677 --> 01:13:26.270
- Together.
- Now.

01:13:26.398 --> 01:13:28.961
- And forever.
- And forever.

01:13:29.081 --> 01:13:30.913
We're going to miss you so much.

01:13:31.042 --> 01:13:32.715
You're not going to miss me that much.

01:13:32.843 --> 01:13:34.676
- What?
- Why not?

01:13:34.805 --> 01:13:36.842
I'm not going to take the part.

01:13:36.966 --> 01:13:40.120
Look, it just isn't worth losing you guys
as friends.

01:13:51.615 --> 01:13:53.652
So you're all bowing out?

01:13:53.776 --> 01:13:57.135
Look, starring in a movie just isn't
worth destroying our friendship.

01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.411
Well, I better start writing.

01:13:59.542 --> 01:14:01.454
I have no idea
how I'm going to write a love story

01:14:01.583 --> 01:14:02.573
without a love interest.

01:14:02.704 --> 01:14:05.425
I think it's time you stand up
to your uncle,

01:14:05.546 --> 01:14:06.662
and make the movie you want to make.

01:14:06.787 --> 01:14:09.588
And if you can't, then maybe this isn't
the movie you should be making.

01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:14.713
Yeah, Chanel,
but what if this is my only chance?

01:14:15.194 --> 01:14:18.745
It's not your chance
if it's not the movie you want to make.

01:14:21.319 --> 01:14:23.311
Don't give up on your dream.

01:14:28.244 --> 01:14:30.920
If you can't be
my leading lady on screen,

01:14:32.608 --> 01:14:37.002
maybe you'd consider
playing the role in real life?

01:14:49.222 --> 01:14:51.612
Too bad we're not at the Taj Mahal.

01:14:53.544 --> 01:14:55.138
- That can be arranged.
- Yeah?

01:14:55.266 --> 01:14:56.541
I think so.

01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:10.874
Sorry for the mess.

01:15:10.999 --> 01:15:14.995
I was just trying to take your advice
and make things happen.

01:15:17.564 --> 01:15:22.163
I meant for you to follow your dreams,
not try to buy me mine.

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:26.606
But I think you're cute for trying.

01:15:30.334 --> 01:15:31.734
One question.

01:15:31.855 --> 01:15:35.294
Would applying to Columbia
count as following my dream?

01:15:35.418 --> 01:15:37.490
Because I talked to my parents,

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.581
and they don't think
it's such a bad idea.

01:15:41.783 --> 01:15:42.773
Yes.

01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:47.148
- Ready?
- No. I'm scared.

01:15:48.148 --> 01:15:49.708
What if she doesn't like me back?

01:15:50.871 --> 01:15:53.227
Sometimes you just got to
put yourself out there

01:15:53.352 --> 01:15:55.390
and not worry about what happens.

01:15:55.795 --> 01:15:57.593
Come on, you can do it.

01:16:12.047 --> 01:16:13.083
Gita?

01:16:22.456 --> 01:16:24.289
Just ignore that.

01:16:25.979 --> 01:16:27.493
You were saying?

01:16:28.660 --> 01:16:31.097
Do you want to have dinner
with these flowers?

01:16:31.223 --> 01:16:34.457
I mean, do your flowers
want to have dinner with me?

01:16:39.710 --> 01:16:43.466
Yeah, I would love to have dinner
with your flowers.

01:16:45.515 --> 01:16:47.028
- You would?
- Yeah.

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:51.390
And by the way,
I love the way you laugh.

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:59.442
Thank you. I love them.

01:16:59.566 --> 01:17:01.523
- You like the flowers?
- Yeah, I do.

01:17:01.647 --> 01:17:04.722
They're red. They match your dress.
It's beautiful.

01:17:07.812 --> 01:17:12.047
Thanks so much. I love them.
They smell so good.

01:17:12.256 --> 01:17:14.692
- You look so beautiful.
- Thanks, Rahim.

01:17:14.818 --> 01:17:16.491
I picked these flowers out
especially for you.

01:17:16.619 --> 01:17:19.694
- I knew you would like them.
- Joaquin?

01:17:19.822 --> 01:17:22.497
I'm sorry I've been avoiding your calls.

01:17:22.624 --> 01:17:26.222
We're in India,
which is kind of a crazy story, but...

01:17:27.188 --> 01:17:31.025
Anyway, I've been doing
a lot of thinking,

01:17:31.151 --> 01:17:35.067
and I realise that
just because we're not going out,

01:17:35.194 --> 01:17:37.426
doesn't mean we can't be friends.

01:17:38.076 --> 01:17:40.798
And I miss you.

01:17:40.919 --> 01:17:43.914
Call me when you can,
I promise I'll pick up.

01:17:50.487 --> 01:17:53.207
Thanks for helping me realise
I was the obstacle all along.

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:59.365
Hey, look what I got for Vik.

01:18:00.655 --> 01:18:02.965
It's the original poster
to Namaste Bombay.

01:18:05.178 --> 01:18:07.740
Guys, I feel so bad for him.

01:18:07.860 --> 01:18:09.454
Who's going to be the star
of his movie now?

01:18:11.623 --> 01:18:13.182
Cheetahs? Look.

01:18:20.671 --> 01:18:24.383
Where is this Raju?
Why he is not here?

01:18:24.514 --> 01:18:26.153
Send him. Goodbye.

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:33.751
Why you are not filling out
application form for dental school?

01:18:34.842 --> 01:18:37.312
We found the perfect lead
for the movie.

01:18:37.444 --> 01:18:41.076
Me, too. Rahim in a wig is wonderful.

01:18:41.887 --> 01:18:44.279
No, Uncle. It's Gita.

01:18:48.974 --> 01:18:50.806
What you talking?

01:18:50.935 --> 01:18:53.771
No one wants to see choreographer
on the screen.

01:18:53.898 --> 01:18:56.652
That's why they are always
behind the scenes.

01:18:56.779 --> 01:18:59.899
She's a star. And I'm going to prove it.

01:19:00.022 --> 01:19:03.141
This is my movie.
And this is my one chance.

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:07.266
- So I have to do what I believe in.
- And?

01:19:11.992 --> 01:19:13.311
And make a great movie.

01:19:17.996 --> 01:19:22.039
Now you're talking like real director.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.400
Thank you. Thank you so much.
I promise I won't let you down.

01:19:26.843 --> 01:19:28.962
Let's see what you got. Come on!

01:19:29.086 --> 01:19:32.080
- Let's make a movie!
- Let's get you Cheetah-fied!

01:19:34.010 --> 01:19:35.922
Silence, please.
We are going for a take.

01:19:36.051 --> 01:19:38.727
Namaste Bombay, BBS, One World.

01:19:39.054 --> 01:19:40.693
- Mark it!
- Playback!

01:19:47.220 --> 01:19:48.414
Hey

01:19:54.866 --> 01:19:56.095
Yeah

01:19:56.227 --> 01:19:58.423
Love always finds a way

01:19:58.548 --> 01:20:00.142
Every single time

01:20:00.270 --> 01:20:02.342
Once we learn to trust our hearts

01:20:02.472 --> 01:20:03.987
And look inside, it feels right

01:20:04.114 --> 01:20:06.231
Now we see who we are

01:20:06.355 --> 01:20:07.835
In a different light

01:20:07.956 --> 01:20:10.108
We're not so far apart

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:11.877
Anything is possible

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.916
With all the differences,
we're stronger here

01:20:16.043 --> 01:20:19.834
