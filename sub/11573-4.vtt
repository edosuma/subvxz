WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:05.662
[BO] Stay back!

00:07.008 --> 00:07.793
[DYSON] What's going on?!

00:07.842 --> 00:12.802
[explosion]

00:25.359 --> 00:27.475
What the hell just happened?

00:33.034 --> 00:36.652
I guess some people don't
deal well with rejection.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.379
Oh my god! Total 911!

00:52.470 --> 00:56.338
Goblins have stormed our kitchen
and they are eating our Sugar Pops.

00:56.432 --> 00:58.798
Tell them the milk has gone bad.

00:58.893 --> 01:02.056
Was someone kept up late by a little
doggie-style celebration of love?

01:02.146 --> 01:04.888
A little "arf-arf awooo" all night long?

01:04.982 --> 01:06.722
I want all the hairy details.

01:06.817 --> 01:11.402
Okay, no. No details, hairy
or otherwise. I feel like crap.

01:11.489 --> 01:13.480
Didn't you see Dyson
at the Dal last night?

01:13.574 --> 01:14.404
Yes.

01:14.492 --> 01:16.073
Okay, well, did you tell
him you wanted him

01:16.160 --> 01:17.866
to be, like, your
boyfriend or whatever?

01:17.954 --> 01:21.321
Did he say that he lurved you?

01:21.415 --> 01:24.907
He had another woman there.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.994
Oh, tits.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.204
According to Dyson,

01:29.298 --> 01:33.007
we are only going to have
sex when I need to heal.

01:33.094 --> 01:36.928
But there was something
there. I saw it, man.

01:37.014 --> 01:39.505
--God, he totally led you on. Piece of shit.
--It is not a big deal, okay?

01:39.600 --> 01:44.344
So, just let me go back
to sleep. I have the flu.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.054
Bo...

01:47.149 --> 01:48.013
Let me sleep.

01:48.109 --> 01:52.022
Bo, that disgusting feeling churning
in your guts, okay, that's not the flu.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.274
That's rejection, honey.

01:56.492 --> 02:00.201
Oh my god, you have never
been rejected before, have you?

02:00.288 --> 02:02.700
I don't know.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.030
Maybe.

02:04.125 --> 02:07.288
Okay, okay, as a human
I am kind of familiar

02:07.378 --> 02:09.710
with you wanting a guy and
him not wanting you back.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.755
And heartbreak sucks, yes,
but there are ways to deal with it.

02:16.387 --> 02:19.800
Or is our little succubus
going to stay in bed forever?

02:19.890 --> 02:23.974
No, okay. Telling Dyson how
I feel, that was your idea.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.096
This is your fault.

02:25.187 --> 02:29.726
That is why I am going to be there
for you every step of the way.

02:29.817 --> 02:31.728
Okay? Including ice cream for breakfast.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.105
Oh, joy.

02:34.196 --> 02:37.233
Look, dealing with rejection--
it can be fun!

02:37.325 --> 02:39.407
I promise you, pinkie-swear.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.233
Okay, enough!

02:41.329 --> 02:43.115
Shit!

02:46.917 --> 02:50.125
Fun,huh?

02:50.212 --> 02:52.544
What's the worst that could happen?

02:54.425 --> 02:57.417
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.423
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.426
My love carries a death sentence.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.508
l was lost for years,

03:05.603 --> 03:08.265
searching, while hiding,

03:08.356 --> 03:12.474
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:12.568 --> 03:17.483
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:24.914 --> 03:27.451
This is not the day to piss me off, kid.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.157
I told you, man, I wasn't even there...

03:30.252 --> 03:32.868
'Cause l was banging your old lady.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.623
[cracking sound]

03:36.717 --> 03:38.503
[HALE] Yo, Dy! Dyson.

03:38.594 --> 03:40.209
He broke my arm.

03:40.304 --> 03:42.340
--Just breathe, alright, breathe.
--|t's not broken.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.217
--Breathe, breathe, breathe...
--|t's just dislocated.

03:44.308 --> 03:46.014
[screaming]

03:46.102 --> 03:47.512
What's gotten under your collar, man?

03:47.603 --> 03:49.389
--[DYSON] See? All better now.
--You got fleas?

03:49.480 --> 03:50.720
You okay?

03:52.233 --> 03:55.851
[KENZI] Ready and begin.

03:57.947 --> 04:00.529
Yes! Bust it! Bust that shit up.

04:00.616 --> 04:04.484
Bust it like it's Dyson's
douchey-ass face!

04:04.578 --> 04:05.863
Yes!

04:06.914 --> 04:09.530
Oww, that face is never kissing again.

04:10.835 --> 04:11.995
--What else?
--We wallow.

04:12.086 --> 04:15.374
Kenzi break-up mix on repeat
all friggin' afternoon.

04:15.464 --> 04:16.670
What, you have a break-up mix?

04:16.757 --> 04:19.169
Dude, you have so much to learn.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.421
Yes, okay. And then
it's girls on the town.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.673
We're going to burn this
city to the ground, baby.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.880
No. No. I don't do that.
I don't do that.

04:25.975 --> 04:28.057
I'm not much of a party queen.

04:29.979 --> 04:33.392
Drinking equals losing control
equals someone gets dead.

04:33.482 --> 04:36.269
Yeah, but what a way to go, dude.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.568
Okay, fine, we'll cut
loose somewhere safe.

04:41.031 --> 04:44.740
You know, this is what
I don't get, okay--

04:44.827 --> 04:46.533
I did nothing wrong, okay,

04:46.620 --> 04:48.531
and I'm the one whose
day has gone to shit.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.238
For Dyson, it's like, "Bo? Bo who?"
He's totally unaffected.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.619
Let's go. Let's go, we're going to party
and we're going to forget about it,

04:53.711 --> 04:55.076
all right?

04:55.171 --> 04:57.913
[BO] Yeah. We'll see about that.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.887
Okay, this is me in the bar.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.092
And this is me going back to bed.

05:11.187 --> 05:14.554
Oh no, no, no, we are not
wasting two hours of dress up.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.900
I don't care if I have to
slather you with faerie dust.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.394
You know, I don't think
that's an actual thing.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.068
--We|l, I don't care.
--Special occasion?

05:21.155 --> 05:23.146
Yeah, it's girls' night out.

05:23.240 --> 05:25.572
In a pub? This pub?

05:25.659 --> 05:30.403
Everyone's safer if Bo's with her
own kind. So, start us a tab, Trickster.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.580
One drink...

05:32.666 --> 05:34.531
--Maybe two.
--All right.
--Okay.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.828
That's right, champ, look at that.

05:38.923 --> 05:40.959
Not only is he dodging
charges on the arrest,

05:41.050 --> 05:42.665
he's going to sue our collective ass.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.296
Never going to happen. It's just talk.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.251
Yeah? You can deduce that?

05:46.347 --> 05:49.464
Interesting, 'cause you haven't been
deducing shit this past while.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.764
Is there a problem, ma'am?

05:50.851 --> 05:54.810
You. You are a problem. This is
your third complaint this week.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.138
It's nothing new. It's just
suspects stirring up shit.

05:57.233 --> 06:00.771
No, now you're losing control
and it's getting in the way.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.362
Look, I'll try harder, okay?

06:02.446 --> 06:03.811
Yeah, you'll do better than that.

06:03.906 --> 06:05.487
Starting tomorrow,
you'll report to the shrink

06:05.574 --> 06:08.987
and you'll get your head shrunk,
or I am chaining you to this desk.

06:17.419 --> 06:21.332
Well done. Now you going to tell
me what the hell's going on?

06:24.593 --> 06:27.505
Come on, man, this is lame,
you leaving me out like this.

06:29.723 --> 06:33.636
Man, I got the cops and I got the Fae.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.140
It's two full-time jobs.

06:37.231 --> 06:40.064
Now, I got Bo. She's a
handful on her own.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.734
Bo? Oh, man. Bo...

06:43.821 --> 06:45.527
Oh, man!

06:45.614 --> 06:47.821
Oh.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.991
You hit that, huh?

06:51.078 --> 06:52.989
--Yes, you did.
--I need a drink.

06:53.080 --> 06:57.289
Fine, but you're my wingman, got it?
I'm tired of being with the ugly chick.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.034
Ohhh!

07:02.506 --> 07:07.170
Oh my god, that is good. That is good.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.501
It makes my throat tingle.

07:08.596 --> 07:13.431
I don't think I have a throat left.
That is some good shit, Mr. T.

07:13.517 --> 07:17.977
Ohh, you. You are the
Kenziest Kenzi ever!

07:19.106 --> 07:20.607
And Dyson...

07:20.691 --> 07:23.728
Dyson is a...

07:23.819 --> 07:25.355
--scratchy-faced...
--Yes.

07:25.446 --> 07:26.686
--g rouchy
--Yes! H

07:26.780 --> 07:27.860
cooch-tease.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.109
And I should have bit it
off when I had the chance.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.031
Oh, unneeded visual, baby.

07:32.119 --> 07:35.282
But, yes, let it all out.
Let it out. What else?

07:35.372 --> 07:38.034
What else? Umm...

07:38.125 --> 07:39.035
Lauren?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.037
Oh my god, don't get me
started on that girl.

07:41.128 --> 07:45.121
I mean, how could you be so cold and
frigid? She's like a frickin' speculum.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.297
She's here.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.966
Hi, Kenzi.

07:50.054 --> 07:51.635
Hey.

07:51.722 --> 07:53.758
You know, as your doctor,

07:53.849 --> 07:57.637
I should recommend against
excessive intoxication.

07:57.728 --> 08:00.094
Who's drunk?

08:00.189 --> 08:05.058
Well, we don't know the effects
of cocktails on your abilities.

08:05.152 --> 08:08.064
Well, I'm not a guy.

08:08.155 --> 08:11.989
So, I can promise you,

08:12.076 --> 08:16.991
booze does not affect
my ability to perform.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.582
Well, I wouldn't want to be
on the receiving end of a

08:22.670 --> 08:26.663
drunken succubus booty-call, so...

08:26.757 --> 08:28.088
take it easy.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.291
No promises.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.220
Keep an eye on her.

08:40.270 --> 08:44.104
Okay, I don't know if it's from
the buckthorn hallucinations,

08:44.191 --> 08:47.854
but that was some serious
sparkage. I think she likes you.

08:47.945 --> 08:53.611
No, it doesn't matter. It doesn't
matter because Lauren is human.

08:53.701 --> 08:56.488
I sleep with her and she dies.

08:57.788 --> 09:02.999
This guy--this guy, on the other hand,
he has sexual chi to burn.

09:03.085 --> 09:06.202
Shhh. He's right behind you.

09:06.296 --> 09:09.003
A woman as lovely as yourself
shouldn't be drinking alone.

09:09.091 --> 09:13.380
Well, I'm not. There's two of you.

09:13.470 --> 09:14.846
I'm Samir.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.212
Bo.

09:17.307 --> 09:21.846
I know. Everybody knows.
The one who won't choose a side.

09:21.937 --> 09:25.145
Neither Light, nor Dark. Exciting.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.223
Yeah. Tell me about it.

09:28.569 --> 09:31.026
That's my wife, Olivia.

09:31.113 --> 09:35.482
Awesome bone structure. She's lovely.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.907
Glad you think so.

09:36.994 --> 09:41.237
We were hoping you'd join us
for a drink back at our place.

09:41.331 --> 09:42.741
Oh.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.208
Oh.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.253
And your wife? Is she okay with that?

09:50.340 --> 09:53.082
My wife is an Erinys. A Fury.

09:53.177 --> 09:56.715
I wouldn't so much as flirt with
you if she didn't give me the say-so.

09:56.805 --> 10:03.517
In fact, you're her choice.
And I wholeheartedly agree.

10:03.604 --> 10:07.722
Yeah. Yeah. I don't know.

10:09.693 --> 10:13.106
Are you a succubus or a succu-bust?

10:13.197 --> 10:15.188
C'mon, a rebound screw is,
like, the greatest way

10:15.282 --> 10:17.398
to get over a guy.
Dude, it's just science.

10:17.493 --> 10:22.078
I told you, I never cared that
much about Dyson, anyway.

10:48.482 --> 10:51.098
My place. Let's go.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.811
We're going to need a safe word.

11:42.369 --> 11:47.329
[moaning]

12:15.736 --> 12:23.905
Gold star for Kenzi. Rebound
sex was exactly what I needed.

12:23.994 --> 12:28.829
Why do you look like you're not at
all sharing this monster hangover?

12:28.916 --> 12:33.205
What can I say? For me, sexual
healing is a literal thing.

12:33.295 --> 12:34.410
I hate you.

12:34.504 --> 12:37.337
And...

12:37.424 --> 12:40.916
there's no strings attached.
It was the best idea you ever had.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.377
You're very welcome.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.884
[knocking on door]

12:47.017 --> 12:51.977
[groaning]

12:56.151 --> 12:59.109
And you're back.
I will go get my earplugs.

12:59.196 --> 13:01.528
--Where's your owner?
--Hi, Olivia.

13:01.615 --> 13:03.901
--Hi!
--I don't have an owner.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.859
It's so good to see you.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.866
I, uh, I hope you're not
back for an encore,

13:09.957 --> 13:12.118
'cause last night was kind
of a one-time thing.

13:12.209 --> 13:16.703
No, you left me quite depleted.
I could barely walk to the car.

13:16.797 --> 13:19.038
--So, what's up?
--I have a problem.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.874
I hear you have special
skills that might be for hire.

13:21.969 --> 13:24.051
They are. Let's talk rates.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.425
Whatever you have to say,
you can say in front of Kenzi.

13:27.516 --> 13:29.302
So, what's the job?

13:29.393 --> 13:32.556
I want you to kill someone.

13:32.646 --> 13:35.763
And that's going to cost extra.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.644
When you mate for life, and your
life is measured in centuries,

13:41.738 --> 13:43.239
you figure out ways to make it work.

13:43.323 --> 13:46.406
So, you and Samir invite other Fae
into your bed whenever you get bored.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.235
It keeps things exciting.
But we've always had a rule--

13:49.329 --> 13:51.411
no snacking behind
each other's backs.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.079
--Naturally.
--What happened?

13:53.166 --> 13:55.248
Samir and I own an
event-planning business.

13:55.335 --> 13:59.123
The girl's a human florist we used
on one occasion. Her name's Jenny.

13:59.214 --> 14:02.923
So, Samir couldn't keep his hands
off the help, huh? It's typical.

14:03.010 --> 14:04.921
At first, I didn't even know
he was shucking around.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.923
--Shucking?
--Sex with a human.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.598
It's beneath us. I feel
dirty by association.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.299
No offence taken.

14:12.394 --> 14:17.263
You know, if it had been one slip, but
it's turned into a full-blown affair.

14:17.357 --> 14:21.771
He has feelings for her. Found these
in his desk. They're from her.

14:21.862 --> 14:24.478
Apparently, they've been writing
this mush to each other for months.

14:24.573 --> 14:25.653
On paper?

14:25.741 --> 14:27.948
It has to stop. I'd kill the girl myself,

14:28.035 --> 14:32.620
but we Light Fae really are supposed to
frown on harming humans or whatever.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.947
How generous of you, Olivia.

14:35.042 --> 14:37.454
But you're unaffiliated.

14:37.544 --> 14:41.787
It would be so nice and uncomplicated
for you to get rid of her.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.622
What are your rates for
exterminating humans?

14:43.717 --> 14:48.006
It wasn't a coincidence that I
ended up in bed with you, was it?

14:48.096 --> 14:51.304
I chose you because of the job.
And my little taste of you

14:51.391 --> 14:53.632
has convinced me that you're
strong enough to pull it off.

14:53.727 --> 14:59.313
Ah, well, problem, Liv, is
that I'm not an assassin.

14:59.399 --> 15:03.392
One touch and she's six feet under.
And you're for hire. What's the issue?

15:03.487 --> 15:05.978
Oh, you know, how killing
someone is wrong.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.813
You're not hearing me.

15:07.908 --> 15:11.321
I'm not going to snuff out a life just
'cause it clashes with your drapes.

15:11.411 --> 15:14.027
Fine.

15:14.122 --> 15:17.956
Screw the complications.
I will take care of this myself.

15:23.090 --> 15:26.674
We should probably find this Jenny.

15:26.760 --> 15:31.220
And save her from a
jealous Fury. Yeah.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.842
So, where do we find her?

15:32.933 --> 15:35.345
Return address.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.676
Exactly why did you take this?

15:37.771 --> 15:40.729
Habit. Just habit.

16:16.977 --> 16:20.390
You stuck your hand in the
wrong cookie jar, little girl.

16:20.480 --> 16:24.814
The price of being with my husband
will be insanity and death.

16:24.901 --> 16:27.153
I hope it was worth it.

16:27.237 --> 16:28.647
Bad Fae.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.623
Stupid girl. Someone should have
told you never to cross a Fury.

16:49.009 --> 16:50.920
Get out of my head.

16:51.011 --> 16:54.253
This is nothing. I'm going to
sear your mind beyond repair.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.212
Let's turn up the heat.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.737
--Let's go.
--My bag.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.787
Call the grease monkeys, man.

17:24.878 --> 17:27.870
I can smell brain oil burning
all the way down the hall.

17:27.964 --> 17:33.459
Tong says break some cases,
I'll break some cases.

17:33.553 --> 17:36.169
Yeah. You know the sure-fire way

17:36.264 --> 17:38.926
to convince a therapist
that you need help?

17:40.393 --> 17:43.635
No? Show up to your
first appointment late.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.972
Therapy is bullshit.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.307
Human bullshit.

17:48.401 --> 17:49.686
Look, if you don't play ball with Tong,

17:49.778 --> 17:51.188
you're going to end up
one castrated cop,

17:51.279 --> 17:55.147
which means you're
useless to our side, okay.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.278
Go to your session.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.666
How's the head?

18:03.750 --> 18:08.164
Achy. But I don't really
remember what happened.

18:08.255 --> 18:10.997
Will you just put that down, please?
And where did you get that, anyway?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.673
Pawn shop. And it's awesome.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.000
Who are you again?

18:15.095 --> 18:17.882
I'm Bo. I'm a--

18:17.973 --> 18:19.554
Private investigator.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.758
Right. You've gotten mixed up
with some very dangerous people.

18:22.852 --> 18:26.686
--Like the mob?
--Sort of.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.015
Jenny, Olivia put a hit on you.

18:30.110 --> 18:33.568
That's why Samir's been so distant.
He was protecting me.

18:33.655 --> 18:37.022
Maybe he was leading you on. Hmm?

18:37.117 --> 18:38.948
Getting a nice piece of tail on the side,

18:39.035 --> 18:42.027
while mouthing empty promises
about leaving his wife?

18:42.122 --> 18:46.491
Then he gets bored and just
bails without even a good-bye!

18:48.628 --> 18:50.619
Or whatever?

18:50.714 --> 18:53.751
I'm sure he cared about you, Jenny.

18:53.842 --> 18:54.877
I can go talk to him

18:54.968 --> 18:59.462
and tell him to handle Olivia
before somebody gets killed.

18:59.556 --> 19:01.763
Now get some rest, okay?

19:05.353 --> 19:07.969
Bo, Bo, you have to tell her what
she's dealing with. It's not fair.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.055
No. I start talking about
that stuff with a human,

19:10.150 --> 19:12.732
they get mad at me and
things start sucking.

19:12.819 --> 19:17.939
This is our life now, Kenzi.
We have to protect it.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.956
So, this is how you want
to play this game?

19:33.506 --> 19:35.997
Mm hmm. What a maverick.

19:36.092 --> 19:40.005
Guess what? I got ten cops a
week who pull this stunt in here.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.512
You know, the tougher you guys act,
the more I can see through you.

19:46.603 --> 19:49.561
Dyson, it's okay to ask for help.

19:52.025 --> 19:57.361
Stab in the dark here... you reek
like too many frozen dinners.

19:57.447 --> 20:01.156
Drank an entire bottle of cheap
merlot by yourself last night,

20:01.242 --> 20:04.609
'cause you live alone with two
cats and you're hooked on Xanax.

20:04.704 --> 20:09.289
So, you tell me--who needs
therapy here, huh?

20:09.376 --> 20:12.618
I'm just going to top-up my coffee
before we really get started.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.498
You do that, Doc.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.798
You've always been strong,

20:18.885 --> 20:22.503
but now, you feel your world is
spinning out beyond your control.

20:22.597 --> 20:26.806
And instead of dealing with
suddenly feeling vulnerable,

20:26.893 --> 20:32.854
you're compensating by swinging
your big manly nightstick.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.395
Stab in the dark.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.099
Samir?

21:29.831 --> 21:31.446
Succubus whore!

21:44.846 --> 21:46.586
Samir?

22:03.490 --> 22:06.607
Kenzi? Arm up.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.443
People are really starting
to lose their heads.

22:19.047 --> 22:22.790
--Ha!
--Easy, killer, it's just me.

22:25.345 --> 22:28.803
Bo, what happened? What's
wrong? What did Samir say?

22:28.890 --> 22:32.257
Not very much.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.217
Nothing, actually.

22:35.939 --> 22:41.354
I'm sorry, Jenny. When I got
there, Samir was dead.

22:47.200 --> 22:52.035
Olivia, she's kind of insane.
She got there first. I was too late.

22:52.121 --> 22:57.206
No. No. No. No.
[whimpering]

22:57.293 --> 23:01.286
I don't deal well with hysterical.

23:01.381 --> 23:06.341
[JENNY sobbing]

23:15.395 --> 23:17.306
[KENZI] Bo, what are you doing?

23:17.397 --> 23:21.686
Taking the edge off, I think.

23:25.488 --> 23:28.275
I know it hurts, Jenny.

23:29.826 --> 23:34.616
You'll get through this.
Just give it time.

23:42.922 --> 23:44.753
Maybe you should go lie
down for a bit, okay?

23:44.841 --> 23:46.297
Okay.

24:05.486 --> 24:07.943
How was your thing
with the counsellor?

24:08.031 --> 24:10.568
Useless.

24:10.658 --> 24:12.614
Jesus.

24:12.702 --> 24:17.571
So, what are we thinking here?
Human kill or Fae on Fae?

24:17.665 --> 24:21.624
Don't know yet. I kept it out
of the human system to be safe.

24:21.711 --> 24:24.248
But the wife's missing.

24:24.339 --> 24:28.298
Hale, where's the head?

24:28.384 --> 24:29.590
Not here.

24:29.677 --> 24:31.292
So, what do you think did this?

24:31.387 --> 24:34.049
Well, something went through those
bones without too much fuss.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.756
Uh huh. And interrupted
the poor man's dinner.

24:36.851 --> 24:38.136
Yeah.

24:38.227 --> 24:42.436
Hey, you think it was a misadventure
with the electric carving knife?

24:43.983 --> 24:47.567
Yeah, I'll just call the cleaners.

24:47.654 --> 24:49.645
Got any witnesses?

24:49.739 --> 24:55.450
All we have is the text that you
got from Samir's own cell phone.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.367
Anonymous.

25:06.214 --> 25:08.296
Not that anonymous.

25:08.383 --> 25:11.796
So, Olivia ran out of the house,
crazy as a loon.

25:11.886 --> 25:17.051
And I found Samir, no head.
Oh, and Jenny is upstairs sleeping.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.177
[DYSON] Did Olivia have the weapon?

25:22.271 --> 25:23.431
I didn't notice.

25:23.523 --> 25:24.433
Well, did she have the head?

25:24.524 --> 25:27.266
--I don't know. Was it not there?
--No.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.818
Well, I don't have it.

25:30.905 --> 25:33.112
--Is there anything else?
--Yeah.

25:33.199 --> 25:36.817
Why did you bring them
back here in the first place?

25:36.911 --> 25:42.122
I was hungry. My last meal left
me just a little unsatisfied.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.324
And you know what,
they were yummy.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.498
You might want to think about
curbing that appetite of yours.

25:48.589 --> 25:51.501
Hey, hairy palms, what's it to you?
Are you jealous much?

25:51.592 --> 25:54.629
Look, I have to find Olivia
before she hurts someone else.

25:54.721 --> 25:59.636
In the meantime, keep the door
locked and your eyes open.

25:59.726 --> 26:01.011
Where are you going to look for her?

26:01.102 --> 26:04.060
Furies always have sisters.

26:05.773 --> 26:11.143
Big, strong Dyson. Is it true
you're a cop now? How tame.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.855
I know Olivia's sick. Tell me
where she is so I can help her.

26:14.949 --> 26:20.489
Someone tried to kill our sister.
No one we don't trust gets near her.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.569
[g rowls]

26:21.664 --> 26:26.829
Ladies, we're here under the
auspices of the Ash, okay?

26:26.919 --> 26:28.420
Want to mess with that?

26:28.504 --> 26:30.040
Well, we can't get her out.

26:30.131 --> 26:32.463
That's why you bring a Siren.

26:35.344 --> 26:40.304
[whistling]

26:48.441 --> 26:50.898
I promise, we'll do what we can for her.

26:50.985 --> 26:55.228
[OLIVIA] It cuts the stems and
pulls off all the pretty petals.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.001
Someone's breaking in!

27:16.302 --> 27:20.215
Not asleep, not me. I'm fine.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.046
I'm going to go check
on our houseguest.

27:22.141 --> 27:23.517
Yep.

27:32.485 --> 27:36.444
I just wanted to see
what it looked like on.

27:36.531 --> 27:43.403
It must be so cool being you,
all kick-ass and everything.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.657
I bet you always get what you want.

27:45.748 --> 27:47.864
You'd be surprised.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.581
So, you're feeling better then?

27:52.672 --> 27:57.587
Oh, much. I just feel so safe here.

27:57.677 --> 27:59.633
It feels so right.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.472
Jenny”.

28:10.898 --> 28:13.310
I know what it's like to be led on

28:13.401 --> 28:17.770
and I would hate to
do that to you. So...

28:17.864 --> 28:23.029
I'm saying this not to be
cruel, but to be clear.

28:26.914 --> 28:31.157
Yeah, of course.

28:31.252 --> 28:35.336
I'll be out of your hair just as soon
as it's safe. You just say the word.

28:35.423 --> 28:39.462
[cell phone ringing]

28:39.552 --> 28:40.462
Dyson .

28:40.553 --> 28:43.169
[DYSON] I have Olivia.
We're at the clinic.

28:43.264 --> 28:44.629
So, we can relax then?

28:44.724 --> 28:46.214
[DYSON] Or you can get
your ass down here.

28:46.309 --> 28:48.470
The Ash is en route and he
wants you to explain this mess.

28:48.561 --> 28:50.142
Well, what if I say my calendar's full?

28:50.229 --> 28:51.560
Don't.

29:00.239 --> 29:01.024
What's up?

29:01.073 --> 29:02.984
I've been summoned.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.361
You are not leaving me alone
with Weepy McWeepster.

29:05.453 --> 29:09.196
Oh yeah, about that. I need for
you to do something for me.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.030
I am not giving her a
sponge bath, I swear to god.

29:11.125 --> 29:14.162
Ah, no. I put a little too
much oomph in my zing

29:14.253 --> 29:15.584
and she's crushing on me big-time.

29:15.671 --> 29:18.708
I need for you to talk
her out of it, gently.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.006
--Poor girl's been through enough.
--Fantastic.

29:21.093 --> 29:24.506
Hey, look on the bright
side--Dyson found Olivia.

29:24.597 --> 29:26.633
And everything will be just fine.

29:30.686 --> 29:34.053
Shit-encrusted maggots.
Burning, scorching rain.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.104
Flaying skin of rotting sinners.

29:36.192 --> 29:39.400
--Yeah, we're working on that.
--Don't touch me!

29:39.487 --> 29:40.272
How is she?

29:40.363 --> 29:44.356
Well, I'm easing her pain, but
her brain is in a death spiral.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.613
The prodigal succubus,
what's your part in this?

29:47.703 --> 29:50.866
She asked me to execute
a human and I refused.

29:50.957 --> 29:53.949
We fought and her attack,
I guess it backfired.

29:54.043 --> 29:56.204
And then someone killed Samir.

29:56.295 --> 29:59.287
I went over to talk to him
and he was already dead.

29:59.382 --> 30:04.251
All I saw was Olivia like this.
She ran as soon as she saw me.

30:04.345 --> 30:07.337
Her insanity does
explain the messy kill.

30:09.141 --> 30:12.053
I didn't kill my husband.

30:12.144 --> 30:15.762
I ate his brains with a tarragon
sauce, but he did not die.

30:15.856 --> 30:19.223
That worthless, cheating sack of shit
taunts me from the other world.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.731
Attacking a human out of
jealousy, murdering your mate,

30:22.822 --> 30:27.486
you're supposed to punish those who
break our rules, not break them yourself.

30:27.576 --> 30:32.445
And you, siding with
a human over a Fae,

30:32.540 --> 30:34.906
you could not take a
more foolish position.

30:35.001 --> 30:37.208
The day is still early.

30:47.888 --> 30:51.847
[flatlining]

30:55.021 --> 30:58.013
I'll break the news to Olivia's sisters.

30:58.858 --> 31:02.601
We'll be keeping you
under close scrutiny.

31:02.695 --> 31:07.985
And you, Dyson, let's hope
your performance improves.

31:13.039 --> 31:18.534
I'm so sorry. I totally forgot
to order it without peppers.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.835
Yeah, even though I told you
seconds before you made the call

31:21.922 --> 31:24.504
that I hated green peppers.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.708
My head still must be a little fuzzy.

31:26.802 --> 31:28.508
Must be.

31:30.389 --> 31:33.301
So...

31:33.392 --> 31:35.132
What kind of food does Bo like?

31:35.227 --> 31:37.809
Oh, nothing special.

31:37.897 --> 31:41.014
She seems like someone
who'd like a good steak.

31:41.108 --> 31:42.848
Maybe.

31:42.943 --> 31:46.401
What's Bo's favourite restaurant?

31:46.489 --> 31:49.572
We don't really eat out much.

31:49.658 --> 31:52.070
__IIWe II ?
--Yeah.

31:52.161 --> 31:55.995
"We" this, "we" that, you're pretty
much right in there with Bo, huh?

31:56.082 --> 31:58.664
Right by her side, day in, day out.

31:58.751 --> 32:01.333
Yeah, you know, we're kind of a team.

32:01.420 --> 32:05.914
Is that healthy? I mean, don't you want
to branch out on your own one day

32:06.008 --> 32:07.999
so that both of you can flourish?

32:08.094 --> 32:11.052
Yeah, you know, you're totally right.

32:11.138 --> 32:15.222
I'm actually planning on going back
to school and getting my law degree.

32:15.309 --> 32:18.597
Oh, law? That's so great.

32:18.687 --> 32:24.023
Yeah, it's so great. Got to pee.

32:24.110 --> 32:25.771
Okay.

32:43.170 --> 32:45.126
Oh, geez.

32:51.804 --> 32:55.513
Ohhh, oh shit!

33:01.480 --> 33:04.267
Oh my god. Agh!

33:24.837 --> 33:26.793
Mine.

33:29.258 --> 33:30.964
Kenzi?

33:35.848 --> 33:37.304
Jenny?

33:39.518 --> 33:44.478
[cell phone ringing]

33:49.361 --> 33:51.977
--Yes?
--[DYSON] Hey. You got to hear this.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.449
I was checking out Samir in our system.

33:54.533 --> 33:55.693
[BO] What? He has a rap sheet?

33:55.784 --> 33:58.321
--No, but Jenny does.
--[BO] Jenny?

33:58.412 --> 33:59.777
Apparently, she was picked
up a few weeks ago

33:59.872 --> 34:01.954
in the parking garage at Samir's office.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.372
No kidding?

34:03.459 --> 34:05.290
[DYSON] I checked with
the arresting officers.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.460
Samir told them that Jenny
had become obsessed.

34:08.547 --> 34:10.959
He had slept with her once,
but she became delusional,

34:11.050 --> 34:14.383
thought that they were having some
sort of a passionate love affair.

34:14.470 --> 34:17.962
What, so the entire relationship
was in her head? That's nuts.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.298
He claims she's been
stalking him for months,

34:20.392 --> 34:23.179
but he begged us to keep quiet because
he didn't want his wife to find out.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.306
Which means what?

34:25.397 --> 34:28.560
[DYSON] Look, the tox screen shows
that the wine that Samir was drinking

34:28.651 --> 34:30.482
was laced with tranquilizers.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.902
Olivia did not have the presence
of mind to drug him, Bo.

34:33.989 --> 34:35.570
She's not our killer.

34:35.658 --> 34:37.569
I think we have bigger problems.

34:37.660 --> 34:39.196
Yeah?

34:40.996 --> 34:42.702
Bo?

34:42.790 --> 34:44.621
[BO] I found the head.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.875
There's a note.

34:48.963 --> 34:52.581
"Beloved, I've taken steps to
remove the obstacle between us.

34:52.675 --> 34:56.588
Join me at the farm.
We'll start our new life together."

34:56.679 --> 34:57.759
Did you sleep with her, too?

34:57.846 --> 34:59.552
I touched her, that's all.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.347
--Bo, you can't use your powers--
--[BO] Just save the lecture, okay?

35:02.434 --> 35:04.550
She's taken Kenzi.

35:04.645 --> 35:06.431
Goddamn it.

35:17.783 --> 35:20.195
Did you really think you could
get between me and Bo?

35:20.286 --> 35:23.494
It wasn't on my radar,
one way or the other.

35:25.207 --> 35:27.414
What are you going to do?

35:30.212 --> 35:34.376
Don't worry. You're just the bait.

35:34.466 --> 35:36.457
It'll be over quick once Bo gets here.

35:36.552 --> 35:40.716
Actually, I prefer slow and drawn out.

35:40.806 --> 35:44.924
There's no reason to
rush anything, you know.

35:49.023 --> 35:50.388
I knew you'd come.

35:50.482 --> 35:53.224
How could I resist such
a romantic gesture?

35:53.319 --> 35:54.559
You're not mad?

35:54.653 --> 35:57.065
No.

35:57.156 --> 36:00.489
At you? Jenny, no.

36:00.576 --> 36:02.532
You're my destiny.

36:04.038 --> 36:05.244
I love you.

36:05.331 --> 36:08.289
Nobody ever loves me
as much as I love them.

36:20.012 --> 36:26.303
Everyone who ever
said they loved me...

36:26.393 --> 36:28.304
They all left.

36:30.522 --> 36:34.435
But I always keep a piece of them close.

36:34.526 --> 36:36.938
Samir was no different.

36:37.029 --> 36:41.648
A coward in the end.
Too scared to love me back.

36:43.702 --> 36:44.657
You killed him.

36:44.745 --> 36:54.461
I went to his home to tell him that
I totally accepted it was over.

36:54.546 --> 36:57.959
He was so relieved.

36:58.050 --> 37:03.215
Then I drugged him
and cut off his head.

37:03.305 --> 37:05.421
How's that for over?

37:08.936 --> 37:12.895
You let me find the body, Jenny.

37:12.981 --> 37:15.233
You pretended to be upset.

37:15.317 --> 37:18.309
I'm sorry I lied, Bo.

37:18.404 --> 37:23.319
But that was before I understood
this thing we have between us.

37:23.409 --> 37:25.525
But everything's different now.

37:25.619 --> 37:28.907
Now, I'll never be separated
from the one I love.

37:35.087 --> 37:37.373
What did you do, Jenny?

37:37.464 --> 37:40.831
You can learn a lot from the Internet.

37:40.926 --> 37:47.263
Like how to turn ordinary fertilizer
and paint into explosives.

37:47.349 --> 37:51.718
When I push this button,
we'll be together forever.

37:51.812 --> 37:58.058
Okay. Okay. But if we're
going to go out with a bang,

37:58.152 --> 38:00.359
I want it to be in your arms.

38:00.446 --> 38:02.778
Oh, I'd like that.

38:02.865 --> 38:03.854
Okay.

38:03.949 --> 38:05.564
Slowly.

38:10.664 --> 38:13.747
How convenient. They're together.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.199
One-stop shopping.

38:15.294 --> 38:18.036
Liar! You're 'ust like ever one else.
I

38:18.130 --> 38:20.712
Okay. I didn't bring them.
Just... just calm down.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.960
--Who are you?
--Our sister's dead because of you.

38:23.051 --> 38:27.294
And you took part. So, you both pay.

38:27.389 --> 38:29.050
Don't, don't! She's got a bomb.

38:29.141 --> 38:31.632
No, this isn't supposed to go like this.

38:31.727 --> 38:33.763
Everybody just calm down,
we're going to talk about this.

38:33.854 --> 38:39.099
No. No more talking. No more
lies. No more lies ever again.

38:52.664 --> 38:54.040
Ahh!

39:03.425 --> 39:07.964
Nice. But you still have
your training wheels on.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.095
Ah!

39:18.190 --> 39:19.646
Ada!

39:20.359 --> 39:21.769
Ah!

39:21.860 --> 39:24.852
At least I can still see the road.

39:24.947 --> 39:26.027
--C'mon.
--Detonator.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.615
No. There's no time.

39:27.699 --> 39:30.611
Bo, don't leave me.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.489
Come back here, you bitch.

39:40.879 --> 39:43.871
[BO] Stay back!

39:43.966 --> 39:46.298
[DYSON] What's going on?

39:46.385 --> 39:51.345
[explosion]

40:03.902 --> 40:05.938
What the hell just happened?

40:11.577 --> 40:14.910
I guess some people don't
deal well with rejection.

40:24.631 --> 40:28.340
Thought I'd be extra crispy for sure.

40:28.427 --> 40:31.385
As if I could get rid of you that easily.

40:33.140 --> 40:39.261
Hey, Bo. I'm not like Jenny, am I?
I'm not too clingy or anything?

40:42.774 --> 40:46.016
You make me want to be a better Fae.

40:46.111 --> 40:50.229
Go seduce a yak. God.

40:50.324 --> 40:55.034
Mass destruction and two dead
Furies. That's quite the Friday.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.530
Trick, pint, please.

40:56.622 --> 40:58.453
The Ash--he's pissed, huh?

40:58.540 --> 41:00.576
Well, I told him you
got there after I did.

41:00.667 --> 41:05.457
And that we both arrived too late to
do anything. So, you're off the hook.

41:05.547 --> 41:07.913
So, you covered for me?

41:08.008 --> 41:10.715
Well, this Jenny thing's a
high-profile serial killer case.

41:10.802 --> 41:15.136
It's scored me some big points in
the cop world for breaking it.

41:15.223 --> 41:18.431
Let'sjust say it's...

41:18.518 --> 41:20.975
returning the favour.

41:21.063 --> 41:22.644
Cheers.

41:24.399 --> 41:27.766
Yeah. Still a douche.

41:27.861 --> 41:29.647
Well, at least he's not a thief.

41:29.738 --> 41:34.277
I seem to be missing a 300-year-old
bottle of buckthorn mead.

41:36.328 --> 41:39.286
You Fae and your funny words.

41:39.373 --> 41:43.241
Look at the time. I should be going--

41:43.335 --> 41:45.417
Why don't you stay and let
me tell you the story of how

41:45.504 --> 41:50.498
that bottle came into my possession?
And why it meant so much to me, hmm?

41:51.885 --> 41:55.343
So, I was thinking...

41:55.430 --> 41:56.590
I'm going to stop you right there.

41:56.682 --> 42:00.470
No, it's good. Listen.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.802
As recent events have suggested,

42:03.897 --> 42:07.606
mixing emotions and sex
can get kind of messy.

42:07.693 --> 42:09.354
That is what I was trying
to avoid with us.

42:09.444 --> 42:12.356
Yeah, well, I get that now.

42:12.447 --> 42:17.532
My offer does still stand.
I'm here whenever you need me.

42:17.619 --> 42:19.701
How about...

42:21.456 --> 42:24.789
for more than just healing?

42:24.876 --> 42:27.458
--How about for fun?
--For fun?

42:27.546 --> 42:30.208
Yeah, there's this whole
"friends with benefits" thing

42:30.298 --> 42:33.131
that I have heard so much about.

42:33.218 --> 42:35.300
--You don't say.
--Yeah.

42:35.387 --> 42:38.629
And you're actually kind of perfect.

42:38.724 --> 42:42.216
You don't care.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.517
You don't die...

42:45.731 --> 42:47.813
And I trust you.

42:47.899 --> 42:49.639
Friends with benefits.

42:49.735 --> 42:52.647
But definitely just friends.

42:52.738 --> 42:54.569
Deal.

43:06.418 --> 43:09.160
So...

43:09.254 --> 43:13.042
You want to get friendly
at your place or mine?

43:24.102 --> 43:28.892
So, there's this woman.
