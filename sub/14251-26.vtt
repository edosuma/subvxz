00:19.519 --> 00:20.645
Full impact.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.085
Final round to Janeway.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.383
Winner: Janeway.

00:23.456 --> 00:24.616
Good game.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.885
For you.

00:25.959 --> 00:26.983
Oh, come on, Seven.

00:27.060 --> 00:28.391
You won four out of ten rounds.

00:28.461 --> 00:29.450
Nothing to be ashamed of.

00:29.596 --> 00:30.961
On the contrary.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.228
l have superior visual
acuity and stamina.

00:34.300 --> 00:35.392
l should've won every round.

00:35.468 --> 00:37.436
Well, Velocity is more
than a test of stamina.

00:37.504 --> 00:38.732
lt's a game of wits.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.330
You are a frustrating opponent.

00:41.408 --> 00:43.933
During the final round
after you dropped your phaser,

00:44.010 --> 00:45.602
you did not even look
at the disk.

00:45.678 --> 00:47.737
And yet you were able
to acquire the target.

00:47.814 --> 00:48.974
lntuition.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.381
lntuition is a human fallacy--

00:51.451 --> 00:53.316
the belief that you can
predict random events.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.944
Oh, belief had nothing
to do with it.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.955
At some level,
conscious or otherwise,

00:57.023 --> 00:58.650
l was aware of several factors--

00:58.725 --> 01:01.216
the trajectory of the disk
after l hit the wall,

01:01.294 --> 01:02.955
the sound it made on its return

01:03.029 --> 01:05.087
and the shadow it cast
on the holo- grid.

01:05.165 --> 01:07.759
lntriguing, but implausible.

01:07.834 --> 01:08.926
l won, didn't l?

01:09.002 --> 01:10.401
Thanks for the match.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.869
l wish to play again.

01:11.938 --> 01:12.927
Not today.

01:13.006 --> 01:14.303
You are fatigued

01:14.374 --> 01:16.604
and concerned
that l will defeat you.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.110
Tired, yes; concerned, no.

01:19.179 --> 01:20.612
Computer, begin first round.

01:20.680 --> 01:22.307
Belay that command.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.578
Seven, try to be a sport.

01:25.652 --> 01:27.085
Game's over.

03:20.333 --> 03:24.099
Captain's Log, Stardate 51978. 2.

03:24.170 --> 03:25.330
lt's been

03:25.405 --> 03:26.895
five months since we received

03:26.973 --> 03:29.407
the encoded message
from the Alpha Quadrant.

03:29.475 --> 03:32.444
We know that the transmission
was from Starfleet Command,

03:32.545 --> 03:34.206
but we still can't decrypt it.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.214
B'Elanna thinks
it's a lost cause,

03:36.282 --> 03:38.079
that too much
of the datastream

03:38.151 --> 03:40.585
has been destroyed,
but l haven't given up.

03:40.653 --> 03:44.646
l keep hoping inspiration
will strike...somehow.

03:52.198 --> 03:53.722
Good morning.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.824
What time is it?

03:54.901 --> 03:56.095
0500.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.295
Oh!

03:57.370 --> 03:58.769
Well, then good morning.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.237
l just heard
from Tom and Neelix.

04:00.306 --> 04:02.171
They're about to leave
the trading colony.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.539
Any luck?

04:03.610 --> 04:06.101
According to Tom, the shuttle's
so loaded down with supplies

04:06.179 --> 04:07.612
he won't make half impulse.

04:07.680 --> 04:09.170
Neelix is asking permission

04:09.249 --> 04:10.910
to bring one of the locals
on board.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.509
He's been very helpful,
and Neelix wants to repay him

04:13.586 --> 04:15.520
by giving him passage
to the next system.

04:15.588 --> 04:16.987
Permission granted.

04:17.055 --> 04:18.956
You might want
to grab some sleep.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.423
We've got a big day ahead.

04:20.560 --> 04:21.891
l will in a while.

04:21.961 --> 04:24.259
Still hunting
for buried treasure.

04:24.330 --> 04:25.592
We've found the treasure.

04:25.665 --> 04:27.599
l just can't pick the lock.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.567
l've tried
over 50 decryption algorithms.

04:29.636 --> 04:31.570
Every time l piece together
a data block,

04:31.638 --> 04:32.764
ten more come unraveled.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.136
What did Starfleet send us?

04:34.207 --> 04:36.232
A map?
The location of a wormhole?

04:36.309 --> 04:38.368
lf l could decode this
today, Chakotay,

04:38.444 --> 04:39.911
we could be home tomorrow.

04:39.979 --> 04:42.641
Then again, it could be
Admiral Chapman's recipe

04:42.715 --> 04:44.239
for the perfect pound cake.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.911
l've been pinning
our hopes on this message,

04:46.986 --> 04:48.544
but l'm starting to wonder.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.112
One way or another,
we've got to find out.

04:51.190 --> 04:53.454
l'll talk to B'Elanna.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.584
You could enlist Seven of Nine.

04:55.662 --> 04:57.152
Hmm...

04:57.230 --> 05:01.030
She should have a few Borg
algorithms up her sleeve...

05:01.100 --> 05:02.795
if she's in the mood.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.336
Problems?

05:06.339 --> 05:09.035
l don't know if she's restless
or if it's just me,

05:09.108 --> 05:11.633
but we're butting heads
more than usual lately.

05:11.711 --> 05:14.271
She seems to challenge
everything l say.

05:14.347 --> 05:17.407
She's learned a lot from you
over the last year.

05:17.550 --> 05:20.917
Maybe the pupil thinks
she's outgrowing the mentor.

05:20.987 --> 05:22.318
Maybe.

05:24.290 --> 05:28.386
Well, this mentor would like
another cup of coffee.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.758
Will you join me?

05:29.829 --> 05:31.694
Love to.

05:37.570 --> 05:40.164
This goes to Engineering...

05:40.239 --> 05:41.831
Sick Bay...

05:41.908 --> 05:43.432
Storage.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.000
l hope that's not going
to the Mess Hall.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.138
l don't remember what this is.

05:48.214 --> 05:49.374
Neelix!

05:49.449 --> 05:52.441
Captain, this man is a genius.

05:52.585 --> 05:55.418
l was trying to negotiate
with a xenon- based life- form

05:55.488 --> 05:57.786
when the universal translator
went off- line.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.154
Arturis here stepped in

05:59.225 --> 06:01.193
and acted as
a perfect go- between,

06:01.260 --> 06:03.285
and he'd never heard
either of our languages.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.295
Oh, they were simple.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.661
- Oh!
- No insult intended.

06:05.732 --> 06:06.664
Neelix!

06:06.733 --> 06:07.893
On my way.

06:07.967 --> 06:09.525
lf you two will excuse me.

06:09.602 --> 06:11.399
Well, welcome to Voyager.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.402
We may be
a linguistically simple folk,

06:13.539 --> 06:15.234
but we're happy
to give you a ride.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.401
Let's see if we can find you
some quarters.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.635
Neelix was right.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.508
Voyager is a welcoming place.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.945
Well, we do our best.

06:23.750 --> 06:26.719
l can't say l've ever met
a living universal translator.

06:26.786 --> 06:28.845
Oh, my people have
a way with languages.

06:28.921 --> 06:30.286
l, myself, know over 4, 000.

06:30.356 --> 06:32.950
And to think l still struggle
with basic Klingon.

06:33.025 --> 06:36.153
You couldn't have heard Neelix
say more than a few phrases.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.594
lt was all l needed.

06:37.663 --> 06:40.393
lt was enough to grasp
the grammar and syntax.

06:40.466 --> 06:41.398
lmpressive.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.559
Oh, not really.

06:42.635 --> 06:43.761
lt's a natural ability.

06:43.836 --> 06:46.361
Some species are born with
great physical prowess,

06:46.439 --> 06:49.169
others, like yours, with
a generosity of spirit.

06:49.242 --> 06:53.372
My people can see patterns
where others see only confusion.

06:55.415 --> 06:56.939
ls something wrong?

06:57.016 --> 06:58.711
No.

06:58.785 --> 07:00.013
Tell me...

07:00.086 --> 07:02.520
how are you
at computational languages?

07:02.588 --> 07:03.577
Algorithms?

07:03.656 --> 07:04.816
Trinary syntax?

07:04.891 --> 07:06.552
lt's all the same to me.

07:06.626 --> 07:10.687
l was wondering if you might
do us another favor.

07:12.331 --> 07:14.663
You weren't exaggerating,
Captain.

07:14.734 --> 07:16.599
This datastream
is badly damaged.

07:16.669 --> 07:20.400
l'd like to see the entire
transmission again.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.365
Are you...Borg?

07:24.444 --> 07:25.604
Yes.

07:25.678 --> 07:28.670
You're much more attractive
than the average drone.

07:28.748 --> 07:30.978
l am no longer part
of the collective.

07:31.050 --> 07:32.381
Ah! l see, l see.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.420
l think l see the problem.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.782
Well, may l?

07:35.855 --> 07:37.823
Please.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.420
Have you encountered
his people before?

07:42.528 --> 07:43.620
Species 1 16.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.630
ls that what you call us?

07:45.698 --> 07:49.725
Yes. The Borg has never
been able to assimilate them.

07:49.802 --> 07:50.734
Not yet.

07:50.803 --> 07:51.929
Seven...

07:52.004 --> 07:53.437
Oh, it's all right, Captain.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.438
The Borg collective
is like a force of nature.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.908
You don't feel anger
toward a storm on the horizon.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.104
You just avoid it.

08:00.179 --> 08:01.111
Ah.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.272
Here it is.

08:02.348 --> 08:03.610
lt's a simple matter

08:03.683 --> 08:05.742
of extracting
the iconometric elements

08:05.818 --> 08:07.786
and triaxilating
a recursion matrix.

08:07.854 --> 08:09.583
Now, why didn't l think of that?

08:09.655 --> 08:11.748
There's a great deal
of information here, Captain.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.622
l think it might be useful
to utilize the other monitors.

08:26.706 --> 08:28.196
You've done it.

08:28.274 --> 08:31.937
Almost. l've reconstructed over
68 kiloquads of information,

08:32.010 --> 08:33.808
but a lot of it
is still garbled.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.313
What about that data block,
14- beta?

08:36.381 --> 08:42.321
That part of the message
is too degraded to recover.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.583
Captain, l've found
a spatial grid.

08:52.732 --> 08:55.667
They've marked
a set of coordinates.

08:55.735 --> 08:57.430
lt's less than ten light- years
from here.

08:57.570 --> 08:59.936
Maybe Starfleet wants us
to proceed to that location.

09:00.006 --> 09:03.942
Maybe. There's only one way
to find out.

09:11.851 --> 09:13.716
We're approaching
the coordinates.

09:13.786 --> 09:16.016
Take us out of warp.
Scan the vicinity.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.682
l am picking up a vessel.

09:18.758 --> 09:20.316
On screen.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.385
ldentify.

09:24.463 --> 09:30.163
Unless l am mistaken, Captain,
the warp signature is Starfleet.

09:41.480 --> 09:42.412
l'll be damned.

09:42.548 --> 09:43.606
They came through.

09:43.683 --> 09:44.707
Tuvok?

09:44.784 --> 09:46.217
Hailing them.

09:48.187 --> 09:49.620
No response.

09:49.689 --> 09:50.747
Life signs?

09:50.823 --> 09:53.417
There is no organic
matter of any kind.

09:53.492 --> 09:55.426
No sign of damage
to the outer hull.

09:55.528 --> 09:57.428
Primary systems are on line,

09:57.496 --> 09:59.054
including life support.

09:59.131 --> 10:01.258
Something must have
happened to the crew.

10:01.334 --> 10:04.269
The answer is somewhere
in that Starfleet transmission.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.895
We need to finish decoding it.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.701
May l call on your talents
again?

10:07.773 --> 10:08.967
Of course.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.440
Take an away team.

10:10.543 --> 10:11.635
Secure the vessel.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.201
Tom, Tuvok.

10:17.683 --> 10:20.277
Captain, l won't pretend
to know you well,

10:20.353 --> 10:22.719
but l am surprised
you're not more...

10:22.788 --> 10:25.689
encouraged by this discovery.

10:25.758 --> 10:29.057
l've learned to walk the line
between hope and caution.

10:29.128 --> 10:32.188
We've had other opportunities
that didn't work out.

10:32.264 --> 10:33.754
But l will admit,

10:33.833 --> 10:35.960
l'm leaning toward hope
this time.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.712
Wow.

10:52.785 --> 10:54.377
Wow, indeed.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.962
l've never seen
this kind of hull geometry.

11:09.035 --> 11:11.435
Looks like they're taking
a whole new approach

11:11.570 --> 11:13.003
to starship design.

11:13.072 --> 11:14.835
The USS Dauntless.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.842
Registry: NX01- A.

11:17.910 --> 11:20.276
Launch date: 51472.

11:20.346 --> 11:22.075
60, 000 light- years
in three months.

11:22.148 --> 11:24.173
l'm trying to access
the crew logs,

11:24.250 --> 11:25.217
but there are none.

11:25.284 --> 11:27.343
l don't think there was a crew.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.684
This helm was set
for auto- navigation

11:29.755 --> 11:31.313
to these coordinates.

11:31.390 --> 11:34.655
lt appears that Starfleet
has provided us with a new ship.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.558
Let's not pack our bags
just yet.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.563
l'd still like to know
how they...

11:39.899 --> 11:42.367
l'm reading power fluctuations
in the warp core--

11:42.435 --> 11:43.993
if you can call it a warp core.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.197
l don't recognize
this engine configuration.

11:50.309 --> 11:52.539
Let's go take a look.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.484
l think we've found
our engine core.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.960
Some kind of new warp drive?

12:16.035 --> 12:17.434
lt's not antimatter.

12:17.536 --> 12:18.833
lt's...

12:21.941 --> 12:23.806
l don't know what it is.

12:33.652 --> 12:37.088
They call this thing
a"quantum slipstream drive."

12:37.156 --> 12:38.851
Quantum slipstream?

12:38.924 --> 12:41.449
l've never seen that
in the engineering manuals.

12:42.795 --> 12:44.319
The ship's powering up.

12:44.396 --> 12:46.864
Auto- navigation is kicking in.

12:49.935 --> 12:51.163
Bridge to Janeway.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.330
The vessel's moving away
at high impulse.

12:53.405 --> 12:54.872
l can't raise the away team.

12:54.940 --> 12:56.601
Pursuit course, Ensign.

13:01.547 --> 13:03.344
l can't shut down the drive!

13:03.415 --> 13:05.906
Computer, disable propulsion!

13:05.985 --> 13:07.213
Unable to comply.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.685
Hang on!

13:16.061 --> 13:17.426
Bridge to Janeway.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.224
They're gone.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.337
Look at this.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.271
Energy from the quantum drive

13:29.341 --> 13:31.832
is being routed
through the main deflector.

13:31.911 --> 13:34.141
ls that what's creating
the slipstream?

13:34.213 --> 13:35.441
lt looks that way.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.810
Fascinating.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.440
Can you make it stop?

13:38.584 --> 13:41.075
l'll try accessing
helm controls.

13:49.728 --> 13:52.458
We're back in normal space.

13:52.598 --> 13:54.088
Scan for Voyager.

13:55.234 --> 13:56.929
No sign of them.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.867
Commander...

13:58.938 --> 14:01.964
we've traveled
over 15 light- years.

14:06.712 --> 14:08.339
Captain's Log, supplemental.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.041
After two days at high warp,

14:10.115 --> 14:12.345
we've rendezvoused
with the Dauntless.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.715
Arturis has helped us

14:13.786 --> 14:16.380
reconstruct
most of the Starfleet message.

14:16.455 --> 14:19.856
The pieces of this puzzle
are finally coming together.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.553
Slipstream technology
is experimental and high risk,

14:22.628 --> 14:24.994
but it's come a long way
in the past year.

14:25.064 --> 14:29.023
We've conducted 47 trial runs,
all of them successful,

14:29.101 --> 14:31.296
but each flight lasted
only five days.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.930
ln order to reach Earth,
you'd have to remain

14:34.006 --> 14:36.600
at slipstream velocity
for a full three months.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.643
Can your crew survive that long?

14:38.711 --> 14:41.771
We believe they can,
and we encourage you to try.

14:41.847 --> 14:43.144
Everything you'll need

14:43.215 --> 14:45.445
is on the Dauntless--
power cells, supplies,

14:45.584 --> 14:47.449
living quarters.

14:47.586 --> 14:49.281
Safe journey.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.152
We hope to see you soon.

14:59.031 --> 15:00.123
Admiral Hayes.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.166
Good man.

15:01.233 --> 15:02.359
Fine officer.

15:02.434 --> 15:03.526
Bit of a windbag.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.732
Let's talk about the risk.
Doctor?

15:07.806 --> 15:10.400
l've examined the away team
for signs of cell damage

15:10.476 --> 15:12.410
or physiological stress--
nothing.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.911
Their little joyride didn't
harm them in the slightest.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.208
Long- term effects?

15:16.282 --> 15:18.716
l'm running the medical
projections right now.

15:18.784 --> 15:20.684
So far, the results
are encouraging.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.084
And the Dauntless itself?

15:22.154 --> 15:24.315
l'd say it's in pretty
good shape, considering.

15:24.390 --> 15:25.721
l've been looking over

15:25.791 --> 15:27.656
the primary systems:
helm, ops, tactical.

15:27.726 --> 15:30.559
They're comparable to Voyager's,
but it's a lean ship, Captain--

15:30.629 --> 15:32.426
no shuttlecraft,
only one transporter,

15:32.531 --> 15:34.021
no holodecks, no replicators...

15:34.099 --> 15:36.761
Well, Mr. Neelix, you may have
your work cut out for you.

15:36.835 --> 15:39.133
Ready and willing, Captain.

15:39.204 --> 15:40.569
So, what are we waiting for?

15:40.639 --> 15:42.106
Your enthusiasm is premature.

15:42.174 --> 15:43.641
Voyager is a proven vessel.

15:43.709 --> 15:47.270
lt would be reckless
to abandon it so quickly.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.280
Come on, where's that
Borg spirit? We'll adapt.

15:49.348 --> 15:52.112
My Borg spirit gives me
an objectivity you lack.

15:52.184 --> 15:53.446
She has a point.

15:53.552 --> 15:55.884
This would mean
leaving Voyager behind.

15:55.988 --> 15:57.819
ls there any way we
could modify Voyager

15:57.890 --> 15:58.982
to create a slipstream?

15:59.058 --> 16:01.253
ln theory, but l don't think
the ship

16:01.327 --> 16:04.387
would hold up very long
under the quantum stresses.

16:04.496 --> 16:07.192
Try to make the modifications.

16:07.266 --> 16:09.632
lf there's a way we can bring
Voyager along for the ride,

16:09.702 --> 16:11.169
l'm all for it.

16:11.236 --> 16:13.932
Harry, B'Elanna, l want you
to take an engineering team

16:14.006 --> 16:15.030
down to the Dauntless.

16:15.107 --> 16:16.165
Start working on a way

16:16.241 --> 16:17.833
to shut down
the slipstream drive

16:17.910 --> 16:19.741
- at a moment's notice.
- Aye, Captain.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.404
Once we have
that safeguard in place,

16:21.480 --> 16:23.107
we can start making
the test flights.

16:23.182 --> 16:24.206
l want this entire crew

16:24.283 --> 16:26.114
to familiarize themselves
with that ship.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.346
See to it.

16:28.420 --> 16:29.887
Dismissed.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.414
Tuvok...

16:33.559 --> 16:34.992
big day.

16:35.060 --> 16:35.992
lndeed.

16:36.061 --> 16:37.323
A way home.

16:37.396 --> 16:39.227
We've been waiting
for this moment for years.

16:39.298 --> 16:41.789
Why don't l feel
more enthusiastic?

16:41.867 --> 16:45.860
Perhaps my mental discipline
is rubbing off on you.

16:45.938 --> 16:47.200
Perhaps.

16:47.272 --> 16:50.241
What do you think about
this little miracle of ours?

16:50.309 --> 16:52.834
l share your concern
about the crew's safety.

16:52.911 --> 16:54.572
We must take every precaution.

16:54.646 --> 16:57.080
Somehow, l don't think
standard diagnostics

16:57.149 --> 16:58.309
and security protocols

16:58.384 --> 17:00.409
are going to make me
feel any better.

17:00.486 --> 17:01.885
Captain?

17:05.357 --> 17:07.825
All of this is just
a little too perfect.

17:07.893 --> 17:08.825
The alien genius

17:08.894 --> 17:11.124
with the answers to
all of our problems...

17:11.195 --> 17:12.788
the message from Starfleet

17:12.865 --> 17:14.799
telling us everything
we want to hear...

17:14.867 --> 17:16.892
a starship delivered
to our doorstep...

17:16.969 --> 17:18.630
What more could we ask for?

17:18.704 --> 17:20.637
They even turned down the beds.

17:20.705 --> 17:23.641
The only thing missing was
chocolates on the pillows.

17:23.709 --> 17:26.405
lt does seem convenient.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.982
l can't put my finger on it,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.109
but from the moment
this all started,

17:33.185 --> 17:35.050
l sensed something was wrong.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.487
lt started when Arturis
boarded Voyager.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.116
Exactly.

17:43.929 --> 17:47.262
We'll proceed as planned,
but l want you to investigate

17:47.332 --> 17:51.200
that ship from stem to stern
and keep an eye on our guest.

17:51.270 --> 17:52.931
See if you can find
out more about him.

17:53.005 --> 17:54.199
Understood.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.604
Let's hope we're just suffering

17:55.674 --> 17:57.335
from some good
old- fashioned paranoia.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.706
Keep me posted.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.210
Captain's Log, supplemental.

18:08.287 --> 18:10.687
So far, the crew hasn't found
any evidence

18:10.756 --> 18:12.781
to support my doubts
about Arturis.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.792
Nevertheless,
l've told them to keep looking

18:14.860 --> 18:16.293
and to keep their optimism
in check.

18:16.361 --> 18:17.589
But that's one order

18:17.663 --> 18:19.392
l don't expect them
to follow to the letter...

18:19.531 --> 18:24.366
Daily Log, Seven of Nine,
Stardate 51981. 6.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.894
l've analyzed the quantum
slipstream technology

18:27.973 --> 18:29.406
of the Dauntless.

18:29.475 --> 18:31.966
lt is similar to the transwarp
drive used by the Borg.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.409
As a result, my expertise

18:33.479 --> 18:35.777
will be crucial
to the mission's success.

18:35.848 --> 18:39.511
Voyager's crew is counting
on that success,

18:39.585 --> 18:43.282
but l find myself ambivalent,
so l am carrying out my...

18:43.355 --> 18:44.788
Despite my apprehension,

18:44.857 --> 18:46.984
l can't help but wonder
what l'll be doing

18:47.059 --> 18:48.549
in three months' time--

18:48.627 --> 18:50.993
still guiding Voyager
through the Delta Quadrant,

18:51.063 --> 18:52.257
searching for a way home,

18:52.331 --> 18:54.128
or looking up old friends
in lndiana?

18:54.199 --> 18:56.929
lf we do return to Sector 001,

18:57.002 --> 18:59.766
will l adapt
to human civilization--

18:59.838 --> 19:03.239
a single Borg among billions
of individuals?

19:09.214 --> 19:11.478
lnitiate emergency shutdown
on my mark.

19:14.486 --> 19:15.953
Now.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.750
Quantum field strength
down to 90 percent.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.753
80 percent.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.990
lt's leveling off at 7 5.

19:26.064 --> 19:28.624
We need to dampen the field
by at least 50 percent.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.998
Try reversing
the quantum field polarities.

19:34.406 --> 19:35.373
70 percent.

19:39.578 --> 19:43.207
55...

19:43.282 --> 19:44.715
49 percent.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.216
We did it.

19:46.285 --> 19:48.048
We've got our safety net.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.951
One step closer to home.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.422
Tuvok wants us to run
a metallurgical analysis

19:52.558 --> 19:54.992
of the bulkheads to look
for anything unusual.

19:55.060 --> 19:56.152
Thank you.

19:56.228 --> 19:57.525
You two run the analysis.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.325
l'll be on the Bridge
with Arturis.

19:59.398 --> 20:02.060
Our resident genius said
he'd help me figure out

20:02.134 --> 20:04.193
how to use
the control sequencers.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.866
Lieutenant, you seem eager
to return to Earth.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.966
"Eager."

20:11.043 --> 20:12.806
l wouldn't go that far.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.579
You were a member of the Maquis.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.139
Starfleet Command will no doubt

20:19.218 --> 20:21.880
hold you responsible
for a multitude of crimes.

20:21.954 --> 20:24.320
You will find nothing on Earth
but adversity.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.085
Well, that's looking
on the bright side.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.820
Let's put it this way:

20:28.894 --> 20:30.987
l'd rather
face the music at home

20:31.063 --> 20:34.032
than spend the rest of my life
in the Delta Quadrant.

20:37.002 --> 20:38.663
What about you?

20:38.737 --> 20:40.932
Looking forward to seeing Earth?

20:41.006 --> 20:42.234
No.

20:42.307 --> 20:45.003
l'm not surprised.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.978
You think people are going
to resent an ex- Maquis?

20:48.046 --> 20:49.604
What about an ex- drone?

20:49.681 --> 20:53.117
We'll be outcasts together.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.153
l'm kidding, Seven.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.710
lt's a joke.

20:56.788 --> 21:00.690
Work on that sense of humor.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.125
lt'll help you
make friends on Earth.

21:06.164 --> 21:08.564
Seven, can you give
me a hand down here?

21:12.604 --> 21:15.630
l'm picking up
an anomalous energy surge.

21:19.144 --> 21:22.511
There are no power conduits
running through this section.

21:27.619 --> 21:30.816
Believe me, Seven, one look
at that big, blue marble

21:30.889 --> 21:32.151
and you'll fall in love.

21:32.224 --> 21:34.920
lt's got just about every
ecosystem you can think of

21:34.993 --> 21:37.723
and hundreds of different
humanoid species live there:

21:37.796 --> 21:41.254
Vulcans, Bolians, Ktarians...

21:41.333 --> 21:44.564
if you like Ktarians.

21:44.636 --> 21:47.901
And there are several other
planets to choose from.

21:47.973 --> 21:49.873
lf you will excuse me, Ensign,

21:49.941 --> 21:51.966
l must speak to the Captain.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.807
Seven.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.441
For what it's worth,

21:57.516 --> 22:00.349
it won't be the same
without you.

22:38.123 --> 22:39.181
Kim to Tuvok.

22:39.257 --> 22:40.724
Tuvok here.

22:40.792 --> 22:42.851
l'm on the Dauntless
in the Engine Room,

22:42.928 --> 22:45.829
and l found something
that qualifies as unusual.

22:45.897 --> 22:47.660
l'll be right there.

22:56.274 --> 23:01.507
Computer, display data block
14- beta, auxiliary display.

23:07.419 --> 23:09.683
Seven, l could use your help.

23:13.625 --> 23:15.559
l'm trying to reconstruct
the last fragment

23:15.627 --> 23:17.288
of the Starfleet message.

23:17.362 --> 23:19.227
Arturis said it was
irreparably damaged.

23:19.297 --> 23:22.789
l know, but l think
he gave up too easily.

23:22.868 --> 23:24.096
lntuition.

23:24.169 --> 23:26.399
lt's intuition if l'm right.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.371
l've designed
a new decryption algorithm.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.704
Let's give it a try.

23:30.776 --> 23:32.437
Captain...

23:32.577 --> 23:36.536
l will not be going with you
to the Alpha Quadrant.

23:43.555 --> 23:45.546
l can understand
your reluctance.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.023
lt's been hard enough

23:47.092 --> 23:49.788
dealing with a crew
of 150 individual humans.

23:49.861 --> 23:52.830
The prospect of an entire planet
must be overwhelming.

23:52.898 --> 23:54.058
l am not overwhelmed.

23:54.132 --> 23:56.259
l simply do not wish
to live among humans.

23:56.334 --> 23:59.360
Well, whether you like it
or not, you're one of us.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.770
You've come a long way
from that drone

24:01.840 --> 24:04.832
who stepped out of a Borg
alcove nine months ago.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.901
Don't turn your back
on humanity now,

24:06.978 --> 24:10.072
not when you're about to
take your biggest step--

24:10.148 --> 24:12.116
Earth...

24:12.184 --> 24:13.617
your home.

24:13.685 --> 24:17.849
l may have come a long way,

24:17.923 --> 24:19.914
but not in the direction
you think.

24:22.027 --> 24:24.393
You've attempted
to influence my development.

24:24.463 --> 24:27.023
You exposed me to your culture,
your ideals.

24:27.098 --> 24:30.431
You hoped to shape me
in your own image,

24:30.535 --> 24:32.560
but you have failed.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.970
You may have noticed
our tendency to disagree.

24:36.041 --> 24:38.441
Oh, l've noticed.

24:38.543 --> 24:41.239
Then you must also recognize
that l do not share your values.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.804
Your desire to explore space
is inefficient.

24:43.882 --> 24:46.442
Your need for familial
connections is a weakness.

24:46.585 --> 24:49.349
Your infatuation with this
planet is irrational.

24:49.421 --> 24:52.117
l won't argue
that you've turned out

24:52.190 --> 24:55.125
differently than l expected,

24:55.193 --> 24:59.323
and that we often have
conflicting points of view.

24:59.397 --> 25:03.390
But right now,
the stakes are higher.

25:03.535 --> 25:06.197
This crew needs your expertise.

25:06.271 --> 25:08.364
Abandon them,
and you diminish their chances

25:08.440 --> 25:09.998
- of getting home.
- lrrelevant.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.372
No, it's not.

25:11.443 --> 25:13.343
We've given you a lot, Seven.

25:13.411 --> 25:15.641
lt's time you gave
something in return.

25:15.714 --> 25:18.808
l have...on many occasions.

25:18.884 --> 25:21.182
Now l refuse.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.791
What would you do,
go back to the collective?

25:30.862 --> 25:32.989
l don't know.

25:33.064 --> 25:34.827
Then what exactly
do you have in mind?

25:34.900 --> 25:36.663
l don't know.

25:36.735 --> 25:37.702
That's my point.

25:37.769 --> 25:39.100
You're asking me
to cast you adrift

25:39.170 --> 25:41.138
in the Delta Quadrant,
alone and without support.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.039
l wouldn't grant that request
to any member of this crew,

25:44.109 --> 25:45.542
because it's too dangerous.

25:45.610 --> 25:46.702
l will survive.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.405
On what, Borg perfection?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.971
Precisely.

25:51.049 --> 25:53.779
l don't buy it.

25:53.852 --> 25:55.615
This isn't about
your independence,

25:55.687 --> 25:57.211
your superiority.

25:59.090 --> 26:01.991
This is about your fear.

26:02.060 --> 26:03.925
You're not making this choice

26:03.995 --> 26:06.088
because you've
outgrown humanity.

26:06.164 --> 26:09.429
l think you're afraid
to go back to Earth.

26:18.209 --> 26:20.040
The algorithm's working.

26:20.111 --> 26:22.170
lt's reconstructing
the data block.

26:28.520 --> 26:29.418
That's strange.

26:29.554 --> 26:30.748
l thought

26:30.822 --> 26:33.416
we already recovered
this part of the message.

26:33.491 --> 26:36.426
Perhaps it is an addendum
from the Admiral.

26:36.494 --> 26:39.429
You did designate him a windbag.

26:39.564 --> 26:41.555
Oh, l don't think so.

26:41.633 --> 26:45.535
The data index doesn't match.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.038
This is a completely
different message.

26:53.011 --> 26:55.445
Apologies from everyone
at Starfleet Command.

26:55.547 --> 26:58.277
We've had our best people
working around the clock

26:58.350 --> 27:00.079
trying to find a wormhole,

27:00.151 --> 27:03.814
a new means of propulsion--
anything to get you back home.

27:03.888 --> 27:05.617
But despite our best efforts...

27:05.690 --> 27:08.818
l know it's not
what you were hoping.

27:08.893 --> 27:10.554
But we have sent you
all the data

27:10.629 --> 27:12.597
we've collected
on the Delta Quadrant.

27:12.664 --> 27:15.792
With any luck, you'll find
at least some part of it useful,

27:15.867 --> 27:18.802
maybe enough to shave
a few years off your trip.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.303
Safe journey.

27:23.375 --> 27:24.899
We hope to see you soon.

27:28.713 --> 27:31.739
Your intuition was correct.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.909
Unfortunately.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.977
Arturis must have
created a false message.

27:37.055 --> 27:39.615
lt sure as hell looks that way.

27:39.691 --> 27:40.988
Janeway to Tuvok.

27:41.059 --> 27:42.754
Yes, Captain.

27:42.827 --> 27:46.092
My suspicions
have been confirmed.

27:49.334 --> 27:51.666
Arturis tampered
with Starfleet's message.

27:51.736 --> 27:54.068
The Dauntless isn't
what it appears to be.

27:54.139 --> 27:55.572
l agree.
We've discovered

27:55.640 --> 27:57.631
alien technology
behind a bulkhead

27:57.709 --> 27:58.835
in Engineering.

27:58.910 --> 28:00.002
l can't identify it.

28:00.078 --> 28:01.602
Where's Arturis now?

28:01.680 --> 28:04.274
On the Dauntless Bridge,
working with Lieutenant Torres.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.374
Go to the Bridge,
but don't tip our hand.

28:06.451 --> 28:08.976
l'll be there with a full
security team within minutes.

28:09.054 --> 28:10.681
Understood.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.450
Let's get weapons.

28:32.177 --> 28:33.769
Don't touch that!

28:35.647 --> 28:38.241
You almost kicked us
into slipstream drive.

28:38.316 --> 28:41.581
Oh. l wouldn't want to do that.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.120
Ku cha mee- roch.

28:43.188 --> 28:45.019
No problem.

28:46.791 --> 28:48.281
You speak Klingon.

28:48.359 --> 28:49.291
l do now.

28:49.360 --> 28:50.418
Your Captain was kind enough

28:50.528 --> 28:52.894
to let me review
your linguistic database.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.432
l only speak
a few phrases myself.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.728
Oh, a shame.
lt's a robust language.

28:57.802 --> 28:59.997
A little too robust for me.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.809
Evacuate the repair teams.

29:06.878 --> 29:07.902
Captain?

29:07.979 --> 29:09.378
Do it.

29:09.514 --> 29:11.106
Explain yourself.

29:11.182 --> 29:13.309
l don't know
what you're talking about.

29:13.384 --> 29:15.784
You fabricated the message
from Starfleet.

29:15.854 --> 29:17.321
l recovered
the real transmission--

29:17.388 --> 29:20.255
the one you said
was irreparably damaged.

29:20.325 --> 29:21.849
That's absurd.

29:21.926 --> 29:23.393
Starfleet didn't send us
this vessel.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.486
And you're not here to help.
ls this your ship?

29:25.563 --> 29:27.190
Please, l...stay calm.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.994
There must be an explanation.

29:29.067 --> 29:31.262
l tried to ignore my gut
feelings, because l got

29:31.336 --> 29:33.600
carried away with the excitement
of getting home.

29:33.671 --> 29:35.263
But you preyed on that,
didn't you?

29:35.340 --> 29:38.332
You took advantage of our hopes,
and now l want to know why.

29:38.409 --> 29:40.969
l...

29:41.045 --> 29:44.276
believe that there is
a threat here, Captain.

29:44.349 --> 29:46.840
But not from me.

29:46.918 --> 29:49.853
l didn't feel it was my place
to make accusations,

29:49.921 --> 29:53.413
but l saw her reconfigure
several key algorithms

29:53.525 --> 29:56.790
two days ago
in the Astrometrics Lab.

29:56.861 --> 29:58.351
And it seemed obvious

29:58.429 --> 30:01.364
she must have been tampering
with the Starfleet message.

30:01.432 --> 30:02.694
You are lying.

30:02.767 --> 30:04.064
She's been sabotaging

30:04.135 --> 30:06.126
your every effort
to reach Earth.

30:06.204 --> 30:08.001
You don't have to believe me,
Captain.

30:08.072 --> 30:10.063
You can find
all the evidence you need

30:10.141 --> 30:11.438
in her personal database.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.738
Evidence you undoubtedly
put there yourself,

30:13.812 --> 30:15.143
just in case you got caught.

30:15.213 --> 30:16.339
Take him to Voyager.

30:16.414 --> 30:18.405
Throw him in the brig.

30:45.610 --> 30:48.078
Janeway to Voyager.
Beam us out of here.

30:48.146 --> 30:50.706
He's trying to deflect
our transporters.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.215
Stand by.

31:05.196 --> 31:06.925
l've got everyone
but Seven and the Captain.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.693
He's found a way to block
their transport.

31:08.766 --> 31:11.064
The ship's going
into slipstream mode.

31:11.135 --> 31:12.932
Pursuit course.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.045
We lost them, Commander.

31:32.490 --> 31:35.721
Tom, bring the warp core
modifications on line.

31:35.793 --> 31:36.987
We're going after them.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.926
Sir, we haven't even had
a trial run yet.

31:40.531 --> 31:42.556
There's no time
like the present.

31:51.843 --> 31:54.710
Where are you taking us?

31:54.779 --> 31:57.009
Home.

31:57.081 --> 31:59.379
How'd you create
the Starfleet Bridge?

31:59.450 --> 32:01.077
Holograms?

32:01.152 --> 32:02.813
Particle synthesis.

32:02.887 --> 32:04.718
Beyond your understanding.

32:04.789 --> 32:06.518
ls this what your people do?

32:06.591 --> 32:08.286
Prey on innocent ships?

32:08.359 --> 32:09.792
"lnnocent."

32:09.861 --> 32:12.853
Typical of Captain Janeway--
self- righteous.

32:14.465 --> 32:16.899
lf l've offended you
or your people in some way,

32:16.968 --> 32:18.265
please tell me.

32:18.336 --> 32:20.167
Diplomacy, Captain?

32:20.238 --> 32:23.696
Your diplomacy
destroyed my world!

32:23.775 --> 32:25.800
What? What are you saying?

32:25.877 --> 32:28.243
You negotiated an agreement

32:28.313 --> 32:31.077
with the Borg collective--

32:31.149 --> 32:35.643
safe passage through their
space, and in return,

32:35.720 --> 32:38.211
you helped them defeat
one of their enemies.

32:38.289 --> 32:39.756
Species 8472.

32:39.824 --> 32:42.725
ln your colorful language, yes--
Species 8472.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.058
Did it ever occur to you
that there were those of us

32:45.129 --> 32:47.723
in the Delta Quadrant with
a vested interest in that war?

32:47.799 --> 32:50.393
Victory would have meant
annihilation of the Borg,

32:50.468 --> 32:52.800
but you couldn't see
beyond the bow of your own ship!

32:52.870 --> 32:54.462
ln my estimation,

32:54.539 --> 32:57.975
Species 8472 posed
a greater threat than the Borg.

32:58.042 --> 32:59.669
Who were you
to make that decision--

32:59.744 --> 33:01.837
a stranger to this Quadrant?

33:01.913 --> 33:04.006
There wasn't exactly time
to take a poll.

33:04.082 --> 33:05.310
l had to act quickly.

33:05.383 --> 33:09.615
My people managed to elude
the Borg for centuries--

33:09.687 --> 33:13.384
outwitting them,
always one step ahead.

33:13.458 --> 33:17.224
But in recent years, the Borg
began to weaken our defenses.

33:17.295 --> 33:18.887
They were closing in,

33:18.963 --> 33:22.990
and Species 8472 was
our last hope to defeat them.

33:23.067 --> 33:24.932
You took that away from us!

33:26.771 --> 33:29.137
The outer colonies
were the first to fall--

33:29.207 --> 33:31.767
23 in a matter of hours.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.038
Our sentry vessels tossed aside.

33:34.112 --> 33:35.875
No defense against the storm.

33:35.947 --> 33:38.677
And by the time they had
surrounded our star system--

33:38.750 --> 33:40.615
hundreds of cubes--

33:40.685 --> 33:44.052
we had already surrendered
to our own terror.

33:45.857 --> 33:50.089
A few of us managed to survive--
ten, 20, 000.

33:50.161 --> 33:51.321
l was fortunate.

33:51.396 --> 33:57.301
l escaped with a vessel,
alone...but alive.

33:57.368 --> 33:58.596
l don't blame them.

33:58.669 --> 34:01.570
They were just drones,

34:01.639 --> 34:04.733
acting with
their collective instinct.

34:04.809 --> 34:06.071
You!

34:06.144 --> 34:08.612
You had a choice!

34:10.648 --> 34:13.116
l am sorry for what happened
to your people,

34:13.184 --> 34:14.411
but try to understand.

34:14.485 --> 34:15.884
l couldn't have known.

34:15.953 --> 34:18.420
lt took me months to find you.

34:18.523 --> 34:21.253
l watched and waited
for my opportunity

34:21.324 --> 34:23.520
to make you pay
for what you'd done.

34:23.594 --> 34:25.061
Then the Starfleet message.

34:25.129 --> 34:28.393
And l knew that your selfish
desire to get home

34:28.466 --> 34:29.989
would surface again,

34:30.068 --> 34:32.831
that l could lure you
to this vessel,

34:32.904 --> 34:35.668
that l could see to it
that you'd all be assimilated

34:35.739 --> 34:39.232
and spend the rest
of eternity as Borg!

34:39.310 --> 34:44.577
l was hoping to get
your entire crew,

34:44.649 --> 34:46.775
but l'll settle
for the two of you.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.786
ln a matter of hours,

34:54.859 --> 34:57.851
this ship will return
to my homeworld...

35:00.231 --> 35:02.699
inside Borg space.

35:02.767 --> 35:05.395
When that happens, you will
be assimilated, as well.

35:05.536 --> 35:07.970
That's irrelevant.

35:09.507 --> 35:12.408
This is what you wanted
all along, isn't it?

35:12.510 --> 35:15.206
To go back to your collective?

35:15.279 --> 35:18.942
You should thank me.

35:38.035 --> 35:39.059
Report.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.434
We're at full impulse,

35:40.571 --> 35:43.734
but we're not breaking through
the quantum barrier.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.275
l'm having trouble controlling
the field parameters.

35:45.343 --> 35:47.709
l need more power
to the deflector.

35:47.778 --> 35:48.710
Bridge to Torres.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.304
l'm already on it,
Commander. Stand by.

35:51.382 --> 35:53.282
Reroute auxiliary power
to deflector control.

35:53.351 --> 35:55.251
Make sure that quantum
warp field is stable.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.946
Aye, Lieutenant.

35:59.657 --> 36:00.988
Deflector at maximum.

36:01.058 --> 36:02.889
l'm focusing the quantum field.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.018
Make it quick.

36:04.095 --> 36:05.892
Hull temperature's at critical.

36:10.701 --> 36:12.191
We're at slipstream velocity.

36:12.270 --> 36:14.397
Structural integrity
is down by nine percent.

36:14.472 --> 36:15.837
We've got less than an hour

36:15.907 --> 36:17.602
before the hull
starts to buckle.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.302
l've located their slipstream.

36:19.377 --> 36:21.902
l'm aligning ours to match.

36:21.979 --> 36:23.412
We're right behind them.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.776
How far behind?

36:24.849 --> 36:26.111
Just a few minutes.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.414
ls there any way
to increase our speed?

36:28.553 --> 36:29.815
None.

36:29.887 --> 36:31.320
We're at maximum.

36:31.389 --> 36:32.913
Maintain course.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.855
lf l know the Captain,

36:34.926 --> 36:37.156
she's already got a plan.

36:38.629 --> 36:40.392
Any ideas?

36:40.464 --> 36:41.726
Not presently.

36:41.799 --> 36:43.061
We better think of something.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.068
We come face- to- face
with your former family

36:45.136 --> 36:46.194
in less than an hour,

36:46.270 --> 36:47.862
and that's one reunion
l'd like to miss.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.600
Unless, of course,
you're looking forward

36:49.674 --> 36:50.800
to rejoining the collective.

36:52.777 --> 36:54.904
l do not believe l am.

36:54.979 --> 36:56.606
Not the ringing opposition

36:56.681 --> 36:59.013
l was hoping for,
but l'll take it.

36:59.083 --> 37:01.449
A drone could walk
through this force field

37:01.519 --> 37:03.282
like it was thin air.

37:03.354 --> 37:05.254
ls there enough Borg technology

37:05.323 --> 37:07.518
left in your body
to let it adapt?

37:07.592 --> 37:09.856
lf l activate
the appropriate nanoprobes,

37:09.927 --> 37:12.361
l could alter
my bioelectric field.

37:12.430 --> 37:15.331
However, l would need to
adjust my cranial implant.

37:15.399 --> 37:17.993
Would a microfilament
do the trick?

37:18.069 --> 37:19.502
lt might.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.334
Then let's get you one.

37:22.406 --> 37:24.966
Once you get outside,
access that control panel

37:25.042 --> 37:26.634
and disable the force field.

37:26.711 --> 37:28.804
Then we'll try
to reach the engine room.

37:28.879 --> 37:31.712
And employ the emergency
shutdown procedure.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.620
Sufficient.

37:37.688 --> 37:39.315
You will need

37:39.390 --> 37:42.621
to cross- link the third
and sixth nodules.

37:50.234 --> 37:52.168
Déjá vu.

37:52.236 --> 37:54.227
Captain?

37:54.305 --> 37:55.363
lf l recall,

37:55.439 --> 37:58.306
this is where
our relationship began

37:58.376 --> 38:00.276
in a brig nine months ago.

38:00.344 --> 38:02.278
l severed you
from the collective,

38:02.346 --> 38:05.281
and you weren't exactly
happy about it.

38:05.349 --> 38:08.284
No, l was not.

38:08.352 --> 38:11.719
ln case l never get
a chance to say this...

38:11.789 --> 38:14.815
l realize that l've been
hard on you at times,

38:14.892 --> 38:16.985
but it was never out of anger

38:17.061 --> 38:19.825
or regret that
l brought you on board.

38:19.897 --> 38:21.262
l'm your Captain.

38:21.332 --> 38:23.732
That means l can't always
be a friend.

38:23.801 --> 38:25.132
Understand?

38:25.202 --> 38:27.500
No.

38:27.571 --> 38:30.802
However, if we are assimilated
our thoughts will become one,

38:30.875 --> 38:33.139
and l'm sure l will
understand perfectly.

38:35.713 --> 38:37.340
A joke, Captain.

38:37.415 --> 38:40.942
You yourself have encouraged
me to use my sense of humor.

38:42.019 --> 38:43.748
Well, it's nice to know

38:43.821 --> 38:46.722
you've taken some
of my advice to heart.

38:51.629 --> 38:53.392
You were correct, Captain.

38:53.464 --> 38:54.897
Hmm?

38:54.965 --> 38:57.365
My desire to remain
in the Delta Quadrant

38:57.435 --> 39:00.029
was based on fear.

39:00.104 --> 39:01.901
l am no longer Borg,

39:01.972 --> 39:04.566
but the prospect
of becoming human is...

39:04.642 --> 39:07.577
unsettling.

39:07.645 --> 39:10.307
l don't know where l belong.

39:10.381 --> 39:12.975
You belong with us.

39:15.553 --> 39:18.420
The adaptations are complete.

39:38.275 --> 39:40.038
We're in business.

39:59.130 --> 40:01.428
l can't initiate
the emergency shutdown.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.432
Our commands are being
blocked from the Bridge.

40:03.567 --> 40:04.727
He's detected us.

40:07.705 --> 40:09.935
The ship's velocity
has just increased.

40:10.007 --> 40:11.338
At our present speed,

40:11.409 --> 40:14.139
we will enter Borg space
in less than 12 minutes.

40:14.211 --> 40:16.441
Do we still have access
to the power distribution grid?

40:16.547 --> 40:17.878
Yes.

40:17.948 --> 40:20.143
lf we can't throw on the brakes,
let's swerve the wheel.

40:20.217 --> 40:22.583
Send a power surge
into the starboard thrusters.

40:22.653 --> 40:24.052
The torsional stress
at these speeds

40:24.121 --> 40:25.145
could tear the ship apart.

40:25.222 --> 40:27.019
lt's either that
or join the hive. Do it.

40:27.091 --> 40:28.456
lf we're still in one piece,

40:28.559 --> 40:30.254
try to gain control
of navigation.

40:30.327 --> 40:31.385
l'll be on the Bridge.

40:31.462 --> 40:32.827
We have a game of Velocity

40:32.897 --> 40:34.455
scheduled for tomorrow,
Holodeck One.

40:34.532 --> 40:36.363
l expect you
to keep the appointment.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.368
Aye, Captain.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.601
Sorry about the bumpy ride.

41:18.676 --> 41:21.042
You can slow this ship down,

41:21.111 --> 41:22.601
but you can't stop it.

41:22.680 --> 41:25.114
ln four minutes,
Captain Janeway will be gone,

41:25.182 --> 41:26.945
and a new drone will be born.

41:27.017 --> 41:28.211
Don't count on it.

41:30.154 --> 41:32.952
Seven of Nine has accessed
your navigational systems.

41:33.023 --> 41:35.150
You taught us
how to use this ship

41:35.226 --> 41:36.352
a little too well.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.395
l can't begin to imagine
your loss,

41:38.462 --> 41:41.056
but try to see beyond
your desire for revenge.

41:41.131 --> 41:42.792
Revenge is all l have left.

41:42.867 --> 41:45.392
No, no. As long as you're
alive, there's hope.

41:45.469 --> 41:47.061
Your people's accomplishments

41:47.137 --> 41:49.901
their knowledge, their
dignity can survive in you.

41:49.974 --> 41:52.135
End this.

42:03.888 --> 42:06.516
l've just destroyed
the navigational controls.

42:06.590 --> 42:08.820
No one can stop this ship now,

42:08.893 --> 42:10.588
not even me.

42:12.162 --> 42:14.096
Two minutes to Borg space.

42:21.705 --> 42:22.797
Direct hit.

42:22.873 --> 42:24.431
The vessel's shields are down.

42:24.508 --> 42:26.169
Transporter standing by.

42:26.243 --> 42:28.108
Get a lock on our people.

42:42.359 --> 42:43.986
Voyager.

42:44.061 --> 42:45.187
Come with me.

42:45.262 --> 42:46.661
lt's not too late.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.493
lt is for you.

42:50.367 --> 42:52.835
l've got them, Commander--
Transporter Room Two.

42:52.903 --> 42:55.167
Alter our slipstream,
hard starboard.

42:55.239 --> 42:57.434
Take us back the way we came.

43:16.160 --> 43:18.060
We are the Borg.

43:18.128 --> 43:19.857
You will be assimilated.

43:19.930 --> 43:21.898
Resistance is futile.

43:26.203 --> 43:28.171
Captain's Log, supplemental.

43:28.238 --> 43:31.173
We remained in the quantum
slipstream for an hour

43:31.241 --> 43:33.106
before it finally collapsed.

43:33.177 --> 43:34.974
Our diagnostics have concluded

43:35.045 --> 43:38.139
that we can't risk
using this technology again,

43:38.215 --> 43:41.275
but we did manage to get
300 light- years closer to home.

43:44.121 --> 43:45.053
Full impact.

43:45.122 --> 43:47.022
Final round to Janeway.
Winner: Janeway.

43:47.091 --> 43:48.183
Nice play.

43:48.258 --> 43:49.384
You almost had me.

43:49.460 --> 43:50.449
Almost.

43:50.594 --> 43:51.686
Go again?

43:51.762 --> 43:53.730
l must report
to the Astrometrics Lab.

43:53.797 --> 43:55.128
There is work to be done.

43:55.199 --> 43:57.929
Work? l gave the crew strict
orders to take some R&R

43:58.002 --> 44:00.470
over the next few days,
and that includes you.

44:00.571 --> 44:02.095
There are more pressing needs.

44:02.172 --> 44:04.868
l am attempting to design
another method of traveling

44:04.942 --> 44:07.410
at slipstream velocities
without damaging Voyager.

44:07.511 --> 44:09.206
l thought that was impossible.

44:09.279 --> 44:12.214
"lmpossible" is a word
that humans use far too often.

44:12.282 --> 44:14.250
l wish to continue my efforts.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.412
A few days ago,
you were ready to abandon ship,

44:17.554 --> 44:21.285
and here you are, practically
laying in a course to Earth.

44:21.358 --> 44:26.796
As we approached Borg space,
l began to reevaluate my future.

44:26.864 --> 44:30.561
The prospect
of becoming a drone...

44:30.634 --> 44:32.568
was unappealing.

44:32.636 --> 44:34.934
Sometimes you've
got to look back

44:35.005 --> 44:36.870
in order to move forward.

44:36.940 --> 44:38.271
Sounds to me

44:38.342 --> 44:40.640
like you're starting
to embrace your humanity.

44:40.711 --> 44:42.440
No...

44:42.513 --> 44:47.780
but as l said,
nothing is impossible.

44:52.156 --> 44:54.784
Computer...

44:54.858 --> 44:56.849
one more game.
