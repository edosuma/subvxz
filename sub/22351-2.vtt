takeover will be unleashed.

00:05.990 --> 00:06.990
Someone is stopping by to twist
up the game.

00:06.990 --> 00:08.990
Plus -- a brand new group of
house guests are about to join

00:08.990 --> 00:09.120
the fun.

00:09.120 --> 00:10.990
Welcome to "big brother"!

00:10.990 --> 00:22.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Announcer: Previously on "big

00:22.990 --> 00:25.990
brother" -- eight strangers
began the battle for a half

00:25.990 --> 00:27.990
million dollars.

00:27.990 --> 00:30.990
(Cheers)
Among them, the city girl, the

00:30.990 --> 00:35.990
football player, the single mom,
the wrestler, the interior

00:35.990 --> 00:38.700
designer, and the country boy.

00:38.700 --> 00:42.990
>> I want to win that dang
money.

00:42.990 --> 00:46.540
>> Announcer: They kept secrets
from their new roommates.

00:46.540 --> 00:46.990
>> Second grade.

00:46.990 --> 00:49.990
I am not a second-grade
teacher.

00:49.990 --> 00:51.700
I am a poker dealer.

00:51.700 --> 00:52.990
>> Announcer: While others share
surprising truths.

00:52.990 --> 00:57.990
>> I am the first transgender
person to be on "big brother"!

00:57.990 --> 01:00.990
(Cheers)
>> What?

01:00.990 --> 01:05.290
Announcer: Audrey quickly
went into game mode.

01:05.290 --> 01:07.990
>> Are you thinking of an
alliance?

01:07.990 --> 01:09.990
Oh, my God.

01:09.990 --> 01:10.990
>> Female power, baby.

01:10.990 --> 01:13.990
Watch out, boys.

01:13.990 --> 01:17.990
>> Announcer: Julie reveals the
battle of the block is back.

01:17.990 --> 01:21.410
>> Julie: Each week, two heads
of households will be crowned.

01:21.410 --> 01:24.990
And each will nominate two
houseguests for eviction.

01:24.990 --> 01:27.990
>> But before the first head of
household competition cobbe

01:27.990 --> 01:30.990
played, a decision had to be
made.

01:30.990 --> 01:35.990
>> Julie: One of you will be
sitting this competition out.

01:35.990 --> 01:36.950
>> I'll do it.

01:36.950 --> 01:39.950
I'm thinking this could either
be a positive for me in this

01:39.950 --> 01:44.700
game or this could be the trip
back to inglewood.

01:44.700 --> 01:46.700
>> Announcer: The inaugural
battle for power was a red

01:46.700 --> 01:50.950
carpet affair.

01:50.950 --> 01:50.990
>> Oh!

01:50.990 --> 01:52.990
Announcer: After a photo
finish --

01:52.990 --> 01:55.990
>> oh!

01:55.990 --> 01:55.990
.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.990
Julie: And everyone is down.

01:58.990 --> 02:00.990
Announcer: James became the
star of the night.

02:00.990 --> 02:04.990
>> Julie: Are you the first head
of household of the summer.

02:04.990 --> 02:09.990
>> I'm not going back to Texas
yet, baby.

02:09.990 --> 02:11.990
>> Announcer: Julie shocked the
house with a brand-new twist.

02:11.990 --> 02:15.990
>> Julie: The bb takeover will
unleash new twists into the

02:15.990 --> 02:17.990
game throughout the summer.

02:17.990 --> 02:20.990
>> Oh, my God.

02:20.990 --> 02:22.990
Announcer: Tonight, a second
group of houseguests join the

02:22.990 --> 02:26.290
epic battle for the half million
dollar prize.

02:26.290 --> 02:28.000
Plus --
a second head of household will

02:28.000 --> 02:29.290
be crowned.

02:29.290 --> 02:33.120
And a surprise guest kicks off
the bb takeover.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.990
What new twists will be
unleashed tonight?

02:35.990 --> 02:37.990
>> Come on!

02:37.990 --> 02:40.700

on "big brother"!

02:40.700 --> 02:42.990

Captioning funded by CBS

02:49.990 --> 02:50.990
(cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Good evening.

02:52.990 --> 02:54.410
I'm Julie chen.

02:54.410 --> 02:59.990
And welcome to night two of the
"big brother" premiere event.

02:59.990 --> 03:03.990
There is a lot to do, so much,
in fact, that I don't even have

03:03.990 --> 03:04.540
time for a "but first."

03:04.540 --> 03:05.990
(Laughter)
So let's meet the next group of

03:05.990 --> 03:07.990
house guests.

03:07.990 --> 03:09.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Oh, my gosh!

03:09.990 --> 03:09.990
Yes!

03:09.990 --> 03:10.990
I'm going!

03:10.990 --> 03:11.990
>> I can't believe it.

03:11.990 --> 03:13.990
'M going to "big brother"!

03:13.990 --> 03:18.990
Yes!

03:18.990 --> 03:19.000
>> Are you serious?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.990
Oh, my God!

03:20.990 --> 03:22.990
>> Are you serious?

03:22.990 --> 03:24.830
Come on, give me something
good.

03:24.830 --> 03:27.830
Come on.

03:27.830 --> 03:31.990
(Screams)
That's what I'm talking about.

03:31.990 --> 03:32.990
My name Liz.

03:32.990 --> 03:36.950
I'm 23 years old, and I am a
coordinator here in sunny Miami

03:36.950 --> 03:40.990
Florida.

03:40.990 --> 03:42.990
I'm very spicy and I'm very
stubborn.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.990
I don't really have a filter but
I know how to control it.

03:46.990 --> 03:52.540
My biggest threat in the house
is going to be jealous girls.

03:52.540 --> 03:56.990
Yes!

03:56.990 --> 04:00.990
>> I'm Jason and I work at a
grocery store as a cashier and

04:00.990 --> 04:02.990
as a fwoik.

04:02.990 --> 04:03.830
Living the dream.

04:03.830 --> 04:03.990
How are you?

04:03.990 --> 04:07.000
Work at the grocery store is
obviously not my job.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.830
Working for minimum wage is not
a good look gh have a good

04:10.830 --> 04:10.990
night.

04:10.990 --> 04:11.990
>> You too.

04:11.990 --> 04:16.990
I live in swansea,
Massachusetts.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.990
And this is my room.

04:18.990 --> 04:23.410
My style is bright colors, lots
of pink and orange.

04:23.410 --> 04:24.990
Deep down I'm a very shallow
person.

04:24.990 --> 04:28.990
It will be amazing to be living
on my favorite show ever and

04:28.990 --> 04:31.990
living on the feeds that I watch
every summer.

04:31.990 --> 04:34.990
I am definitely a "big brother"
historian.

04:34.990 --> 04:36.990
I am a superfan.

04:36.990 --> 04:37.990
>> I'm Vanessa.

04:37.990 --> 04:40.990
I'm a professional poker player,
and I live in Las Vegas.

04:40.990 --> 04:43.990
I've always loved games, and I
learned thousand play poker when

04:43.990 --> 04:47.990
I was 5 years old.

04:47.990 --> 04:50.120
I'm known for being one of the
best poker players in the world.

04:50.120 --> 04:54.290
I've won over $4.5 million in
poker tournaments during my

04:54.290 --> 04:55.990
career.

04:55.990 --> 04:55.990
400.

04:55.990 --> 04:58.990
The skills it takes to be good
in poker is what it takes to be

04:58.990 --> 04:59.990
good in "big brother."

04:59.990 --> 05:01.990
You need logic.

05:01.990 --> 05:04.990
Being able to read people and
not let them read and you

05:04.990 --> 05:05.540
self-discipline.

05:05.540 --> 05:05.990
I'm all in.

05:05.990 --> 05:09.700
I studied game theory, the study
of decision-making.

05:09.700 --> 05:10.990
It's going to be a huge
advantage.

05:10.990 --> 05:13.990
While others might rely on their
physical competitiveness --

05:13.990 --> 05:14.990
>> my call.

05:14.990 --> 05:17.990
I'm going to be relying on my
high IQ.

05:17.990 --> 05:18.990
>> Oh, my God!

05:18.990 --> 05:20.990
No way!

05:20.990 --> 05:22.990
>> You've got something on a
card.

05:22.990 --> 05:23.990
>> Oh, my God!

05:23.990 --> 05:25.990
I'm going to "big brother"!

05:25.990 --> 05:33.990
>> Woo!

05:33.990 --> 05:35.990
The star dentist is going to
"big brother"!

05:35.990 --> 05:38.990
Let's do this!

05:38.990 --> 05:39.990
My name's John.

05:39.990 --> 05:42.990
I'm from Scranton, Pennsylvania.

05:42.990 --> 05:43.990
I fix people's teeth.

05:43.990 --> 05:48.120
But at night, I go home and I
rock out on the guitar.

05:48.120 --> 05:51.990
When I applied for dental school
all the other people that were

05:51.990 --> 05:53.990
interviewing were like, oh, I
just want to help people.

05:53.990 --> 05:55.990
I just want to make great
smiles.

05:55.990 --> 05:56.990
I was like, no!

05:56.990 --> 06:01.990
I want money.

06:01.990 --> 06:04.990
My relationships don't last very
long if you could call them

06:04.990 --> 06:05.830
relationships.

06:05.830 --> 06:09.410
It's really hard to find a girl
who's not a gold-digger once you

06:09.410 --> 06:14.990
say you're a dentist.

06:14.990 --> 06:15.990
>> My name is Becky.

06:15.990 --> 06:16.990
I'm 26.

06:16.990 --> 06:18.950
And I'm a proud Denver native.

06:18.950 --> 06:19.990
I love the outdoors.

06:19.990 --> 06:23.990
It's where you can always find
me.

06:23.990 --> 06:25.990
Glowing up we would go camping
and hiking.

06:25.990 --> 06:30.990
They love that granola-munching
hippy lifestyle.

06:30.990 --> 06:31.990
It's always rubbed off on me.

06:31.990 --> 06:32.990
I'm fun.

06:32.990 --> 06:33.540
I'm friendly.

06:33.540 --> 06:34.990
And people can easily trust me.

06:34.990 --> 06:36.990
And with that, I can manipulate
them the way that I need to in

06:36.990 --> 06:38.990
order to get to the pop.

06:38.990 --> 06:45.990
-- Top.

06:45.990 --> 06:48.990
>> I'm Steve and I'm probably
the kid you cheated off of in

06:48.990 --> 06:49.990
high school in math class.

06:49.990 --> 06:50.990
I love music.

06:50.990 --> 06:52.120
It's just a part of my blood.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.990
At the same time I love to come
back and play with me set when I

06:56.990 --> 06:57.990
get home.

06:57.990 --> 06:59.540
I'm a huge nerd.

06:59.540 --> 07:02.990
If you like the socially awkward
engineer I'm your guy.

07:02.990 --> 07:08.990
I am the biggest "big brother"
fanatic that you could possibly

07:08.990 --> 07:08.990
imagine.

07:08.990 --> 07:11.990
A little fourth-grade project of
what we're going to be when we

07:11.990 --> 07:15.990
grow up and I drew a picture of
me with a key around my neck.

07:15.990 --> 07:17.120
It looks like it's coming true.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.990
>> I have an hour to pack.

07:19.990 --> 07:21.990
'M outta here.

07:21.990 --> 07:27.990
Take your groceries to the
next register, boo.

07:27.990 --> 07:28.990
>> I like colors.

07:28.990 --> 07:29.990
I like prints.

07:29.990 --> 07:31.990
I like anything bright.

07:31.990 --> 07:36.990
This is my whole personality
boiled down into one feature.

07:36.990 --> 07:37.990
>> I'm now dating a woman.

07:37.990 --> 07:38.990
For me love is love.

07:38.990 --> 07:40.990
>> I'm not looking forward to
playing with people who are

07:40.990 --> 07:41.990
there to play emotionally.

07:41.990 --> 07:42.990
>> I'm a people person.

07:42.990 --> 07:46.990
So I love all I can get.

07:46.990 --> 07:49.990
>> These are the only people I
have a hard time being around,

07:49.990 --> 07:50.990
male, female.

07:50.990 --> 07:52.990
>> Why wear cloms if they're
basic.

07:52.990 --> 07:55.950
So all you basic Bridges, you
better watch out.

07:55.950 --> 07:59.990
>> I'm a superfan.

07:59.990 --> 08:00.990
Hate superfans.

08:00.990 --> 08:03.990
People who look down on
superfans, you're on the wrong

08:03.990 --> 08:04.990
show, honey.

08:04.990 --> 08:06.990
>> Everybody likes a good show,
man.

08:06.990 --> 08:09.540
The cute guy, I'll go for that
in the house.

08:09.540 --> 08:12.990
Maybe someone that my mom would
like for once.

08:12.990 --> 08:12.990
>> Hi.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.990
I thought you might want
them.

08:15.990 --> 08:17.990
>> Mom, mom, I got this.

08:17.990 --> 08:21.990
If there's a guy that sparks
now interest, we're going to be

08:21.990 --> 08:25.990
in there for a long time, so I
am super down for a show mance.

08:25.990 --> 08:30.990
>> I am only going to be open to
a showmance if it helps me in

08:30.990 --> 08:31.700
the game.

08:31.700 --> 08:33.990
>> It is showtime.

08:33.990 --> 08:34.990
'M going to miss you so
much.

08:34.990 --> 08:37.990
Bye.

08:37.990 --> 08:38.990
>> I'll see you in three months.

08:38.990 --> 08:40.990
With a big check.

08:40.990 --> 08:43.990
>> Have fun.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.990
I believe in you.

08:45.990 --> 08:47.990
'Ll see you guys in three
months.

08:47.990 --> 08:47.990
>> See you.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.410
Good luck.

08:49.410 --> 08:49.990
>> I love you guys.

08:49.990 --> 08:50.990
Okay?

08:50.990 --> 08:57.990
>> I love you too.

08:57.990 --> 08:58.990
Molly, I miss you.

08:58.990 --> 09:00.540
"Big brother," here I come!

09:00.540 --> 09:00.990
It's "big brother" time.

09:00.990 --> 09:02.990
Kiss me goodbye.

09:02.990 --> 09:05.990
>> Let's go!

09:05.990 --> 09:11.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Hello, new house

09:11.990 --> 09:13.990
guests.

09:13.990 --> 09:16.990
>> Hi, Julie.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.120
Julie: How's everyone doing?

09:18.120 --> 09:19.990
Good.

09:19.990 --> 09:21.990
Julie: I'm sure you all know
our motto -- "expect the

09:21.990 --> 09:22.990
unexpected."

09:22.990 --> 09:23.990
(Laughter)
You guys know this game.

09:23.990 --> 09:25.410
I like that.

09:25.410 --> 09:28.990
Well, with that in mind, I have
something to tell you.

09:28.990 --> 09:33.990
Some of the house guests have
already moved into the house.

09:33.990 --> 09:39.990
Not only have they moved in, but
they already know about two big

09:39.990 --> 09:43.990
twists that have been unleashed
into the game.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.990
Are you ready to hear what they
are?

09:45.990 --> 09:47.990
>> Yes.

09:47.990 --> 09:51.990
Julie: If you watched last
season, you are all too familiar

09:51.990 --> 09:54.990
with the battle of the block.

09:54.990 --> 09:58.990
Well, it's back in play.

09:58.990 --> 10:03.990
Once again, you could go from
being head of household to being

10:03.990 --> 10:08.410
evicted in the same week.

10:08.410 --> 10:09.990
Those already in the game have
crowned the first head of

10:09.990 --> 10:13.290
household.

10:13.290 --> 10:21.990
And that means tonight one of
you will become the second hoh.

10:21.990 --> 10:23.990
Now, for twist number two.

10:23.990 --> 10:29.990
It's a complete game changer,
and it's called the bb takeover.

10:29.990 --> 10:30.990
Here's how it works.

10:30.990 --> 10:35.990
The bb takeover will
unleash new twists into the game

10:35.990 --> 10:37.990
throughout the summer.

10:37.990 --> 10:42.990
You never know who, or what, it
might be.

10:42.990 --> 10:46.990
With that, it's now time to get
you into the house.

10:46.990 --> 10:49.990
You will enter in two groups.

10:49.990 --> 10:53.830
The first three to enter the
house are --

10:53.830 --> 10:55.990
Liz.

10:55.990 --> 10:56.990
Becky.

10:56.990 --> 10:57.990
And Steve.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.000
Head on in.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.990
(Applause)
(Ding dong)

11:09.990 --> 11:24.990
(Screams)
>> I'm Steve.

11:24.990 --> 11:25.410
Helli.

11:25.410 --> 11:26.830
T's like a dream.

11:26.830 --> 11:29.000
It's the same house I've been
watching on TV for as long as I

11:29.000 --> 11:29.990
can remember.

11:29.990 --> 11:30.990
>> Nice to meet you.

11:30.990 --> 11:31.120
James?

11:31.120 --> 11:31.990
Oh, wow.

11:31.990 --> 11:33.990
This is a lot of names.

11:33.990 --> 11:38.990
>> One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

11:38.990 --> 11:39.990
11, 12.

11:39.990 --> 11:40.120
I do numbers.

11:40.120 --> 11:40.990
I don't do names.

11:40.990 --> 11:42.990
It's something I'll going to
struggle with.

11:42.990 --> 11:43.990
What's your name?

11:43.990 --> 11:44.830
>> Meg.

11:44.830 --> 11:44.990
Nice to meet you.

11:44.990 --> 11:45.700
Meg.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.990
Okay.

11:48.990 --> 11:50.950
>> Steve, Mr. suave with the
ladies.

11:50.950 --> 11:55.990
I feel like I'm the first girl
he's hugged in a while.

11:55.990 --> 12:02.990
>> Hi.

12:02.990 --> 12:06.990
Clay is 10 out of 10.

12:06.990 --> 12:08.990
I am deciding him up and town.

12:08.990 --> 12:11.990
He is fine.

12:11.990 --> 12:11.990
>> Audrey?

12:11.990 --> 12:12.990
It's nice to meet you.

12:12.990 --> 12:16.990
>> Jace.

12:16.990 --> 12:16.990
Miami.

12:16.990 --> 12:19.990
Cool, I was born in
ft. Lauderdale.

12:19.990 --> 12:20.290
>> Ft. Lauderdale.

12:20.290 --> 12:22.990
Yeah, yeah.

12:22.990 --> 12:23.990
We have to talk.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.990
Yeah, yeah, for sure, for
sure.

12:25.990 --> 12:27.990
Where you from, sweetheart?

12:27.990 --> 12:29.990
>> Colorado.

12:29.990 --> 12:32.990
Literally God's resting on
this earth in Colorado.

12:32.990 --> 12:33.990
What part of Colorado?

12:33.990 --> 12:36.990
>> So I'm a Colorado native,
born and raised, but I don't

12:36.990 --> 12:44.290
think I've ever heard it called
rado before.

12:44.290 --> 12:45.990
It's right in the heart of
Denver

12:45.990 --> 12:47.950
>> Julie: That leaves --
Jason.

12:47.950 --> 12:47.990
John.

12:47.990 --> 12:49.990
And Vanessa.

12:49.990 --> 12:51.990
You three may now head on in.

12:51.990 --> 12:59.990
(Cheers and applause)
(Doorbell)

12:59.990 --> 13:03.990
(Screams)
>> Hi!

13:03.990 --> 13:05.990
What's going on?

13:05.990 --> 13:06.410
Snr oh, my God.

13:06.410 --> 13:09.990
Why is everyone so friggin'
beautiful?

13:09.990 --> 13:12.990
>> Little Jason walks in the
house, I feel like I'm sea

13:12.990 --> 13:15.990
biscuit and he's my jockey.

13:15.990 --> 13:18.540
>> Check that out, boo.

13:18.540 --> 13:23.950
Oh, this house is beautiful!

13:23.950 --> 13:25.990
Oh, mylanta.

13:25.990 --> 13:27.990
>> Nice to meet you.

13:27.990 --> 13:29.830
John.

13:29.830 --> 13:32.990
I'm literally the last person
in the door.

13:32.990 --> 13:34.990
There's all these people.

13:34.990 --> 13:36.990
I'm just hugging anything that's
in front of me.

13:36.990 --> 13:41.290
>> Nice to meet you, man.

13:41.290 --> 13:42.990
Hi, honey.

13:42.990 --> 13:42.990
John.

13:42.990 --> 13:43.990
I'm Audrey.

13:43.990 --> 13:44.120
Audrey, I'm Vanessa.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.990
Nice to meet you.

13:45.990 --> 13:46.990
How you doing?

13:46.990 --> 13:49.990
>> You guys already do your hoh?

13:49.990 --> 13:49.990
Eah.

13:49.990 --> 13:52.990
Who won?

13:52.990 --> 13:55.990
The "big brother's" a game
with incomplete information.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.990
You only want to be the one with
the information edge.

13:58.990 --> 14:01.990
I'm an information deficit right
now and I have ground to make

14:01.990 --> 14:02.410
up.

14:02.410 --> 14:05.410
>> You already had the hoh?

14:05.410 --> 14:05.990
Eah.

14:05.990 --> 14:07.990
All right.

14:07.990 --> 14:07.990
Beautiful.

14:07.990 --> 14:08.990
Oh!

14:08.990 --> 14:10.990
So I'm lovin' this house.

14:10.990 --> 14:11.990
Everyone's all smiles.

14:11.990 --> 14:14.990
But this is "big brother."

14:14.990 --> 14:16.990
Things aren't always what they
seem, and people aren't always

14:16.990 --> 14:19.950
what they seem.

14:19.950 --> 14:23.990
>> I live here.

14:23.990 --> 14:25.990
You guys want to do the
roundtable?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.990
You want to get to know
everybody?

14:27.990 --> 14:29.990
>> Oh, yes, yes, yes yes.

14:29.990 --> 14:30.990
Let's do it.

14:30.990 --> 14:33.950
>> L and the dining room table
we go.

14:33.950 --> 14:35.990
Welcome to "big brother"!

14:35.990 --> 14:38.950
>> Woo!

14:38.950 --> 14:41.990
(Cheers)
>> All right.

14:41.990 --> 14:44.120
Who's kicking us off?

14:44.120 --> 14:46.990
>> My name's John.

14:46.990 --> 14:49.990
My friends call me Johnny Mac.

14:49.990 --> 14:50.990
I'm 27 and I'm a dentist.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.410
>> Nice.

14:52.410 --> 14:53.000
Yeah, buddy.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.990
Johnny Mac.

14:56.990 --> 14:58.410
>> John says he's a dentist.

14:58.410 --> 15:01.950
And I think you're lyin' through
your teeth.

15:01.950 --> 15:04.000
John doesn't give off a dentist
vibe.

15:04.000 --> 15:11.000
He gives off a -- not a dentist
vibe.

15:11.000 --> 15:11.830
>> Hi.

15:11.830 --> 15:12.990
I'm Liz.

15:12.990 --> 15:14.990
I am 23.

15:14.990 --> 15:15.700
>> Hi.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.990
Nice to meet you, Liz.

15:17.990 --> 15:22.990
I had a babe before I left
but I broke it off because you

15:22.990 --> 15:24.990
only get to go on "big brother"
once.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.990
(Applause)
So I am single.

15:26.990 --> 15:28.120
>> I love it!

15:28.120 --> 15:32.990
Liz automatically said she
dropped a date and I can relate.

15:32.990 --> 15:34.410
I did something similar.

15:34.410 --> 15:36.990
I'm thinking the more single
girls in the house, the more fun

15:36.990 --> 15:38.990
for theboros.

15:38.990 --> 15:40.990
-- The bros.

15:40.990 --> 15:41.120
>> I'm Steve.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.990
I'm 22.

15:42.990 --> 15:47.990
I'm from gouverneur, New York
where where I'm studying audio

15:47.990 --> 15:47.990
engineering.

15:47.990 --> 15:48.990
>> Nice to meet you, Steve.

15:48.990 --> 15:57.990
So I meet Steve, and I'm
almost positive this is Terry's

15:57.990 --> 15:57.990
identical twin.

15:57.990 --> 16:01.290
If this kid is anything like
Ian, I have to keep my eye on

16:01.290 --> 16:01.990
him.

16:01.990 --> 16:03.540
>> My name is James.

16:03.540 --> 16:03.990
I'm from Texas.

16:03.990 --> 16:06.830
I love to hunt, fish.

16:06.830 --> 16:07.950
I'm aural about country.

16:07.950 --> 16:11.990
So other than that, I'm the hoh
for the week, I guess.

16:11.990 --> 16:16.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> He freaking killed it.

16:16.990 --> 16:17.990
Left and right, man.

16:17.990 --> 16:18.990
It was insane.

16:18.990 --> 16:19.990
>> I'm Vanessa.

16:19.990 --> 16:22.990
I'm from Las Vegas and I'm a dj.

16:22.990 --> 16:25.000
>> Woo!

16:25.000 --> 16:29.990
People had preconceptions
about poker players, maybe that

16:29.990 --> 16:32.000
player blufers in real life,
maybe manipulators.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.990
I'm going to keep it simple.

16:32.990 --> 16:34.990
I'm a dj.

16:34.990 --> 16:35.990
>> I am Jason.

16:35.990 --> 16:37.990
I am 25, although I look like
I'm 12.

16:37.990 --> 16:41.410
(Laughter)
I stock groceries at the grocery

16:41.410 --> 16:45.990
store overnight and I live in my
mom's abatement!

16:45.990 --> 16:45.990
>> Yay!

16:45.990 --> 16:48.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> So, Jason is giving me this

16:48.990 --> 16:52.990
whole little pee wee Herman type
of vibe.

16:52.990 --> 16:52.990
Okay?

16:52.990 --> 16:54.990
I just want to pick him up and
put him in my pocket and take

16:54.990 --> 16:55.990
him home.

16:55.990 --> 16:56.990
He's so cute.

16:56.990 --> 16:57.990
>> And gay obviously.

16:57.990 --> 17:01.990
(Laughter)
(Cheers)

17:01.990 --> 17:01.990
>> Okay.

17:01.990 --> 17:03.990
My name's Audrey.

17:03.990 --> 17:04.990
I'm 25.

17:04.990 --> 17:07.990
I'm a digital media consultant.

17:07.990 --> 17:11.990
And I am the first transgender
person to play "big brother."

17:11.990 --> 17:21.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> I can't help but just respect

17:21.990 --> 17:24.990
her and realize how much courage
that must take, to be the first

17:24.990 --> 17:25.990
to come on "big brother."

17:25.990 --> 17:26.290
That's a big deal.

17:26.290 --> 17:31.990
So props to her.

17:31.990 --> 17:32.990
>> My name's Becky.

17:32.990 --> 17:33.950
I'm 26.

17:33.950 --> 17:35.990
I'm from Denver, Colorado, born
and raised.

17:35.990 --> 17:40.990
I'm a retail manager and just
love hiking and outdoors and

17:40.990 --> 17:41.990
anything of that nature.

17:41.990 --> 17:44.990
>> All right.

17:44.990 --> 17:45.950
Woo!

17:45.950 --> 17:48.990
I'm looking around the table,
and I see Vanessa, Becky, and

17:48.990 --> 17:49.990
Liz.

17:49.990 --> 17:50.990
They're all smoke bombs.

17:50.990 --> 17:53.990
I wouldn't mind any of these
girls being hoh with me.

17:53.990 --> 17:56.990
To share a room with them, that
would be awesome.

17:56.990 --> 17:57.990
>> We made it!

17:57.990 --> 18:03.950
(Cheers)
>> That's right.

18:07.990 --> 18:10.990
So can we just talk about
these other two people now.

18:10.990 --> 18:10.990
>> Right.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.700
Yeah.

18:12.700 --> 18:18.830
Ial coming in, now we really
need to figure this out.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.990
>> I don't know what these two
empty seats are.

18:20.990 --> 18:21.990
It could be something awesome.

18:21.990 --> 18:23.540
It could be something really
bad.

18:23.540 --> 18:26.990
But it is blowing my mind.

18:28.990 --> 18:33.000
>> Julie: The house guests are
in, and the game is on, but

18:33.000 --> 18:35.990
there is still a lot more to
come.

18:35.990 --> 18:39.990
Our first bb takeover
begins next with a surprise

18:39.990 --> 18:42.990
guest who has an amazing twist
for the house guests.

18:42.990 --> 18:45.990
Plus, we'll crown the second hoh
of the summer.

18:45.990 --> 18:47.990
Stay with us.

18:47.990 --> 18:49.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Can't get enough of

18:57.990 --> 19:00.990
"big brother"?

19:00.990 --> 19:02.990
See what's happening with the
live feed on CBS.Com.

19:02.990 --> 19:06.990
>> You know you want to watch.

19:06.990 --> 19:15.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Welcome back to night

19:15.990 --> 19:17.990
two of the "big brother"
premiere event.

19:17.990 --> 19:23.000
The house guests know all about
the bb takeover but have no idea

19:23.000 --> 19:27.990
it's about to happen right now.

19:27.990 --> 19:30.990
And here to help out is a
surprise guest, the host of the

19:30.990 --> 19:35.990
emmy award winning "the amazing
race" -- Phil keoghan.

19:35.990 --> 19:43.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Phil: I dressed up for you.

19:43.990 --> 19:44.990
Julie: I noticed.

19:44.990 --> 19:45.950
Thank you.

19:45.950 --> 19:45.990
>> Phil: You look lovely.

19:45.990 --> 19:47.990
Julie: Thank you.

19:47.990 --> 19:50.000
Well, I'm not out in the
elements like you are.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.540
This would look ridiculous if I
went on "race" like this.

19:52.540 --> 19:55.990
(Laughter)
Well, Phil, you are here to take

19:55.990 --> 19:57.290
over the game.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.830
>> Phil: Yes.

19:58.830 --> 20:02.990
Julie: Tell everyone exactly
how you are taking over "big

20:02.990 --> 20:03.990
brother."

20:03.990 --> 20:06.990
>> Phil: Well, you know, over
the years, we have taken some

20:06.990 --> 20:09.990
"big brother" contestants and
put them on "the amazing race."

20:09.990 --> 20:12.000
Do you remember Jeff and Jordan
and Brendon and Rachel when they

20:12.000 --> 20:13.990
came on "the amazing race"?

20:13.990 --> 20:15.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: We actually have some

20:15.990 --> 20:16.990
video of them.

20:16.990 --> 20:17.700
>> Phil: Really?

20:17.700 --> 20:17.990
Julie: Let's take a look.

20:17.990 --> 20:21.990
Phil: Oh, I'd like to see
that.

20:21.990 --> 20:26.990
>> We have some catching up to
do.

20:26.990 --> 20:28.000
>> Yeah.

20:28.000 --> 20:30.990
I'm afraid of all the animals.

20:30.990 --> 20:30.990
>> Sheep.

20:30.990 --> 20:31.990
That was Noah.

20:31.990 --> 20:31.990
>> Oh, Noah.

20:31.990 --> 20:39.990
(Laughter)
You wonder why I laugh.

20:39.990 --> 20:42.990
>> I want to go on a trip around
the world with my best friend.

20:42.990 --> 20:43.990
>> Do you know where you're
going?

20:43.990 --> 20:44.990
>> No, I don't!

20:44.990 --> 20:46.990
Why do you always say that?

20:46.990 --> 20:46.990
>> Because you're walking.

20:46.990 --> 20:48.990
This is supposed to be fun
and good.

20:48.990 --> 20:50.990
(Laughter)
(Cheers and applause)

20:50.990 --> 20:57.830
>> I think it's only fair,
Julie, that since you gave me

20:57.830 --> 20:59.990
some "big brother" contestants
to take around the world that

20:59.990 --> 21:01.990
perhaps you should enjoy having
some amazing racers in the house

21:01.990 --> 21:02.990
to play the game.

21:02.990 --> 21:03.990
What do you think about that?

21:03.990 --> 21:04.990
>> Julie: I love it!

21:04.990 --> 21:05.990
Bring it on.

21:05.990 --> 21:07.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Phil: Now, last season on

21:07.990 --> 21:09.990
"the amazing race," we did
something that we have never

21:09.990 --> 21:11.990
done before.

21:11.990 --> 21:14.950
We decided that we would take
people who had never met each

21:14.950 --> 21:17.990
other before and send them
around the world on what we call

21:17.990 --> 21:19.990
the most extreme blind date
ever.

21:19.990 --> 21:24.990
(Laughter)
And I thought that perhaps maybe

21:24.990 --> 21:28.990
we could have Jeff and Jackie
from "amazing race" come into

21:28.990 --> 21:30.990
the house to play the game.

21:30.990 --> 21:33.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: I love it.

21:33.990 --> 21:37.990
Phil: And just to give you an
idea of what you're in for, I've

21:37.990 --> 21:39.990
got a little piece of tape as
well that I would like to show

21:39.990 --> 21:40.990
you.

21:40.990 --> 21:43.120
This is what you're in for.

21:43.120 --> 21:44.990
>> Are you ready to meet your
partners?

21:44.990 --> 21:46.830
All right.

21:46.830 --> 21:48.290
>> Woo!

21:48.290 --> 21:51.540
I definitely am looking for a
hot guy.

21:51.540 --> 21:53.990
>> I think that I'm a great
catch.

21:53.990 --> 21:54.990
>> Like guys that are tall.

21:54.990 --> 21:56.990
I like guys that are built.

21:56.990 --> 22:02.990
Also fun, goofy, hopefully that
will happen for me.

22:02.990 --> 22:02.990
>> Turkey!

22:02.990 --> 22:05.540
Let's go!

22:05.540 --> 22:09.990
>> I'm not a lady to be talked
down to.

22:09.990 --> 22:11.990
>> I'm driving.

22:11.990 --> 22:13.990
Stay here and shut up.

22:13.990 --> 22:14.990
That's all I ask.

22:14.990 --> 22:15.120
Do not cut me off.

22:15.120 --> 22:17.990
>> Okay.

22:17.990 --> 22:18.990
There again.

22:18.990 --> 22:19.290
Jackie!

22:19.290 --> 22:22.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Julie: Say hello to house

22:22.990 --> 22:26.990
guests number 15 and 16, from
season 26 of "the amazing race,"

22:26.990 --> 22:28.990
Jeff and Jackie.

22:28.990 --> 22:39.990
(Cheers and applause)
Jeff, Jackie, welcome to "big

22:39.990 --> 22:41.990
brother."

22:41.990 --> 22:46.990
We know that your relationship
on "the amazing race" was --

22:46.990 --> 22:48.990
shall we say -- passionate
(Laughter)

22:48.990 --> 22:51.290
Where do things stand now
between the two of you?

22:51.290 --> 22:52.990
>> I mean, we're close.

22:52.990 --> 22:54.410
We're very good friends.

22:54.410 --> 22:58.990
We communicate, I would say, at
least a few times a week.

22:58.990 --> 22:59.990
So we're not like passionate.

22:59.990 --> 23:00.540
I wouldn't use that.

23:00.540 --> 23:01.990
(Laughter)
But we are definitely close

23:01.990 --> 23:03.540
friends.

23:03.540 --> 23:04.990
>> Julie: Okay, Phil.

23:04.990 --> 23:08.990
It's time for you to introduce
your twist to the house guests.

23:08.990 --> 23:09.990
>> Phil: Can't wait.

23:09.990 --> 23:16.990
>> Oh my gosh.

23:16.990 --> 23:27.990
♪ Get ready for a takeover ♪
(Cheers)

23:27.990 --> 23:29.990
>> Phil: Hello, house guests!

23:29.990 --> 23:31.990
I am Phil keoghan from "the
amazing race."

23:31.990 --> 23:35.120
(Cheers)
I am taking over "big brother"

23:35.120 --> 23:35.990
this week.

23:35.990 --> 23:38.990
That's why I'm here.

23:38.990 --> 23:41.990
We have had some very cool "big
brother" couples run on "the

23:41.990 --> 23:43.990
amazing race."

23:43.990 --> 23:48.990
We'll, I thought it was only
fair that I return the favor by

23:48.990 --> 23:53.990
putting two "amazing race"
contestants in the house to play

23:53.990 --> 23:55.990
the "big brother" game with all
of you.

23:55.990 --> 23:59.990
What do you think about that?

23:59.990 --> 24:03.540
(Door bell)
You hear that?

24:03.540 --> 24:04.990
(Screams)
That's them right now.

24:04.990 --> 24:06.700
They're at the door.

24:06.700 --> 24:16.990
(Screams)
(Cheers)

24:16.990 --> 24:18.990
>> Jackie, hi, Steve.

24:18.990 --> 24:21.830
So when Jeff and Jackie walk
in the door, I instantly

24:21.830 --> 24:23.990
recognize them from "the amazing
race."

24:23.990 --> 24:27.000
Jeff and Jackie have this trust
that was established outside the

24:27.000 --> 24:27.830
house.

24:27.830 --> 24:30.990
I'm hoping it can maybe make
them an easy early target.

24:30.990 --> 24:35.990
>> How long have you guys been
here?

24:35.990 --> 24:38.990
>> Hoh competition, hoh is
James.

24:38.990 --> 24:44.990
James is the hoh.

24:44.990 --> 24:47.990
>> Going from traveling around
the world to being stuck in this

24:47.990 --> 24:47.990
house.

24:47.990 --> 24:51.000
It can't be more of a different
game.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.950
>> Nice neat you, honey.

24:53.950 --> 24:55.990
O, no, no, we're just
friends.

24:55.990 --> 24:58.410
>> We already have a ton of
blondes in the house but

24:58.410 --> 25:00.990
everybody knows Archie is better
and Veronica.

25:00.990 --> 25:08.990
That's what Jackie's going to be
like.

25:08.990 --> 25:12.990
>> Are they a couple or they
were just teammates?

25:12.990 --> 25:16.540
>> These are two people that
done did gulliver's travel.

25:16.540 --> 25:17.540
They been around the world.

25:17.540 --> 25:19.990
>> Oh, my God.

25:19.990 --> 25:20.000
Oh, my God.

25:20.000 --> 25:20.990
>> Are they dating?

25:20.990 --> 25:21.990
They married?

25:21.990 --> 25:22.990
That's a tough one.

25:22.990 --> 25:24.990
That could be a tough one.

25:24.990 --> 25:25.990
>> Where you guys from?

25:25.990 --> 25:26.990
I'm from Texas.

25:26.990 --> 25:27.990
I'm from Houston.

25:27.990 --> 25:29.990
>> I heard an accent.

25:29.990 --> 25:33.990
My first job walking into the
"big brother" house is to make

25:33.990 --> 25:37.410
it apparent that I am here to
play this game solo.

25:37.410 --> 25:41.990
But in reality, I know that I
have Jackie in my back pocket.

25:41.990 --> 25:43.990
It's unspoken that we're on the
same wave leng.

25:43.990 --> 25:44.990
>> Who are you?

25:44.990 --> 25:50.990
I'm a houseguest.

25:50.990 --> 25:52.120
Julie: When we return, we'll
crown the second head of

25:52.120 --> 25:54.990
household of the season.

25:54.990 --> 25:59.000
Who will stand next to James,
sharing the most powerful person

25:59.000 --> 26:00.990
-- position in the house?

26:00.990 --> 26:04.990
Plus -- last night I revealed
that there is a pair of

26:04.990 --> 26:07.120
identical twins playing the
game.

26:07.120 --> 26:08.990
Have you figured out which house
guest will be switching places

26:08.990 --> 26:09.990
with their twin?

26:09.990 --> 26:11.000
Stay with us.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.000
(Cheers and applause)

26:20.990 --> 26:22.990
Welcome back to "bigbrother."

26:22.990 --> 26:26.990
Last night James became the
first head of household.

26:26.990 --> 26:29.290
So who will join him as the
second hoh?

26:29.290 --> 26:35.990
It's time to find out.

26:35.990 --> 26:38.990
Houseguests, I need everyone to
please gather in the living

26:38.990 --> 26:40.830
room.

26:40.830 --> 26:41.990
>> Julie!

26:41.990 --> 26:47.990
Woo!

26:47.990 --> 26:52.540
>> Julie: It is now time to
crown head of household number

26:52.540 --> 26:52.990
two.

26:52.990 --> 27:00.830
(Cheers)
And like we did for the first

27:00.830 --> 27:04.990
eight houseguests, I need one of
you from the second group of

27:04.990 --> 27:08.410
eight houseguests to sit out.

27:08.410 --> 27:13.700
Please decide who that person
will be, and I'll see you in the

27:13.700 --> 27:18.990
backyard soon enough.

27:18.990 --> 27:20.990
>> If you haven't played yet.

27:20.990 --> 27:22.990
Walking into the house, I
feel like it's already going to

27:22.990 --> 27:23.990
be a target on my back.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.290
We're coming in from "the
amazing race."

27:25.290 --> 27:28.700
So I don't want to sit out on
the first challenge.

27:28.700 --> 27:29.990
What good does that do me?

27:29.990 --> 27:34.990
>> Who wants to sit out?

27:34.990 --> 27:35.990
All right.

27:35.990 --> 27:36.990
I'll sit out.

27:36.990 --> 27:37.990
>> You sure?

27:37.990 --> 27:38.990
It's fine, you guys.

27:38.990 --> 27:39.990
I'll sit out.

27:39.990 --> 27:42.700
>> Being a gambler, I'm all
about edges.

27:42.700 --> 27:46.990
When Julie says that someone can
sit out of the hoh competition,

27:46.990 --> 27:49.990
I see the opportunity.

27:49.990 --> 27:51.950
I am willing to take the gamble.

27:51.950 --> 27:54.990
>> How about whoever sits out
cannot be nominated?

27:54.990 --> 27:55.990
>> That's fair.

27:55.990 --> 27:56.990
Who sat out for the first round?

27:56.990 --> 27:57.990
>> Okay.

27:57.990 --> 27:57.990
Okay.

27:57.990 --> 27:58.990
Let's do that.

27:58.990 --> 27:59.990
That's fair.

27:59.990 --> 27:59.990
>> Thank you.

27:59.990 --> 28:01.990
I'll be a good cheerleader.

28:01.990 --> 28:07.990
>> There you go.

28:07.990 --> 28:13.410
(Cheers)
>> Oh, my God.

28:13.410 --> 28:16.990
Look at the babies.

28:16.990 --> 28:22.990
>> So I'm walking out into the
yard, and I'm seeingal cow with

28:22.990 --> 28:24.990
a big eye and I'm seeing this
pregnant alien with the third

28:24.990 --> 28:26.120
kid on the way.

28:26.120 --> 28:29.990
I'm like, it is pretty crowded
out here.

28:29.990 --> 28:32.990
>> Julie: Hello, houseguests.

28:32.990 --> 28:34.830
Hi, Julie!

28:34.830 --> 28:38.990
Julie: It's time to crown a
second head of household.

28:38.990 --> 28:44.410
Keep in mind, whomever wins this
competition will stand side by

28:44.410 --> 28:49.410
side with James but not for
long, as only one of the heads

28:49.410 --> 28:52.990
of household will remain in
power and be safe come next

28:52.990 --> 28:54.990
week's live eviction.

28:54.990 --> 29:01.990
This competition is called "ufoh
no!"

29:01.990 --> 29:04.990
And here's how it works.

29:04.990 --> 29:09.990
The first seven houseguests
attended the red carpet premiere

29:09.990 --> 29:13.950
of the bb films
feature presentation of "ufoh

29:13.950 --> 29:20.990
no!"
(Cow moos)

29:20.990 --> 29:21.990
You seven are actually in the
film.

29:21.990 --> 29:27.990
(Cheers)
On my go, the ufos that are

29:27.990 --> 29:32.990
circling above will try to suck
you up to the mothership.

29:32.990 --> 29:37.990
Your job is to hold on tight to
your stakes.

29:37.990 --> 29:40.990
If you get sucked up, you are
out of the game.

29:40.990 --> 29:45.990
The winner of this hoh
competition will be the last

29:45.990 --> 29:51.990
houseguest holding on to his or
her stake.

29:51.990 --> 29:54.990
Stand behind your pole and hang
on.

29:54.990 --> 30:03.990
(Cheers)
>> The stakes going into this

30:03.990 --> 30:04.540
competition is really high.

30:04.540 --> 30:06.990
And whoever wins this, I got to
be able to work with them,

30:06.990 --> 30:11.990
because if not, I could be
sitting on the chopping block.

30:11.990 --> 30:14.700
>> If there were strippers man,
that would be on point right

30:14.700 --> 30:14.990
now.

30:14.990 --> 30:24.990
>> Julie: It's lights, camera,
action!

30:24.990 --> 30:29.990
♪
>> oh, my God.

30:37.990 --> 30:40.700
This is nutty.

30:40.700 --> 30:42.990
>> If you want to win head of
household, you have to stay on

30:42.990 --> 30:43.410
the stake.

30:43.410 --> 30:49.990
The problem is, we're getting
pulled up by these alien laser

30:49.990 --> 30:50.540
beams.

30:50.540 --> 30:52.990
It's like being pulled by an
18-Wheeler.

30:52.990 --> 30:56.990
From the instant the spaceship
comes in, starts abducting us

30:56.990 --> 30:59.990
and you hear all these noises
coming on that I've never heard

30:59.990 --> 31:01.990
before.

31:01.990 --> 31:09.990
I would call this a close
encounter of the worst kind.

31:09.990 --> 31:14.990
(Scary noises)
>> I'm a huge "big brother"

31:14.990 --> 31:14.990
fanatic.

31:14.990 --> 31:16.990
I know it's really important to
try to blend in.

31:16.990 --> 31:18.990
I don't want to win the
competition because that just

31:18.990 --> 31:21.990
puts a huge target on your back.

31:21.990 --> 31:23.990
So I'm going to stay right in
the middle so it doesn't give

31:23.990 --> 31:24.990
anyone a reason to nominate me.

31:24.990 --> 31:26.990
>> You guys having fun?

31:26.990 --> 31:27.990
Es.

31:27.990 --> 31:30.990
I just need to basically use
these legs.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.990
I've been using my entire life
as a dancer.

31:32.990 --> 31:35.990
I'm just going to wrap my legs
around this pole and hold on for

31:35.990 --> 31:36.410
dear life.

31:36.410 --> 31:40.990
I want to show the house that I
am definitely a competitor.

31:40.990 --> 31:45.990
Oh.

31:45.990 --> 31:47.990
>> You guys are doing awesome.

31:47.990 --> 31:52.700
Jason's guns are already
poppin'.

31:52.700 --> 31:53.990
>> I'm definitely going to try
to win.

31:53.990 --> 31:58.990
It could open doors for me that
normally wouldn't be open, like

31:58.990 --> 32:03.990
the Alpha males could approach
me for an alliance.

32:03.990 --> 32:06.990
>> I went pretty much as low as
I can get unless you put a

32:06.990 --> 32:08.700
couple drinks on me, then I'll
get lower.

32:08.700 --> 32:12.990
(Laughter)
>> Are you guys not going to get

32:12.990 --> 32:15.990
shot with dirty tomatoes?

32:15.990 --> 32:18.990
>> You're too cute for that.

32:18.990 --> 32:20.000
Gh oh.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.990
>> Oh, my God.

32:21.990 --> 32:25.990
It's alien poo.

32:25.990 --> 32:27.990
>> The green slime is so bad.

32:27.990 --> 32:33.990
I don't know how many of you
have been peed on by a thousand

32:33.990 --> 32:34.000
aliens.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.990
It's not fun.

32:35.990 --> 32:41.990
>> Ah!

32:41.990 --> 32:43.990
I'm using muscles I never
knew I had.

32:43.990 --> 32:44.990
My feet are throbbing.

32:44.990 --> 32:49.120
And next thing I know, I am
dripping in this God-awful goop.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.990
Can't even see out of my eyes.

32:50.990 --> 32:57.990
It's disgusting.

32:57.990 --> 33:05.990
>> Watch out for the ufo!

33:05.990 --> 33:07.990
That increased the weight a
lot.

33:07.990 --> 33:10.990
>> So when the second beam goes
off, I feel like there is an

33:10.990 --> 33:13.990
alien giant pulling me up into
the sky.

33:13.990 --> 33:14.990
Oh, my gosh.

33:14.990 --> 33:20.990
It was way harder than the first
beam.

33:20.990 --> 33:22.990
>> I'm grabbing on to this pole
for dear life.

33:22.990 --> 33:25.990
The force is definitely not with
me right now.

33:25.990 --> 33:28.830
>> Don't let the alien take me
away.

33:28.830 --> 33:35.990
(Cheers)
>> Don't let go!

33:35.990 --> 33:36.990
No!

33:36.990 --> 33:41.990
Julie: The aliens have gotten
Steve.

33:41.990 --> 33:43.990
>> That's awesome.

33:43.990 --> 33:50.990
(Cheers)
>> As a huge "big brother"

33:50.990 --> 33:53.990
superfan, I know being the first
to fall makes me an easy target.

33:53.990 --> 33:57.990
I hope these nominations don't
suck me into a black hole this

33:57.990 --> 34:01.990
week.

34:01.990 --> 34:02.990
>> This is one-handed.

34:02.990 --> 34:03.990
I know.

34:03.990 --> 34:05.990
Just doing other things while
you're hanging on.

34:05.990 --> 34:08.700
>> I'm just making sure I'm
cleaning my pole.

34:08.700 --> 34:08.990
Why waste time?

34:08.990 --> 34:13.290
>> I think the most surprising
thing right now is that we have

34:13.290 --> 34:17.990
a kid that's probably 80 pounds
soaking wet, but he looks like

34:17.990 --> 34:18.990
he's super comfortable.

34:18.990 --> 34:22.990
>> I was born for this night.

34:22.990 --> 34:28.990
You ain't getting me off
nothing.

34:28.990 --> 34:32.990
>> Okay, baby.

34:32.990 --> 34:37.990
(Laser noises ]
>> Oh!

34:37.990 --> 34:38.410
, no.

34:38.410 --> 34:40.990
I know right now I have a
target on my back.

34:40.990 --> 34:45.990
And I want to make this big
target a lot smaller.

34:45.990 --> 34:53.990
So beam me up, "big brother."

34:53.990 --> 34:56.990
>> Julie: Jeff is out of this
competition.

34:56.990 --> 35:01.990
>> Oh!

35:01.990 --> 35:04.990
Look at John hanging on.

35:04.990 --> 35:07.990
As a dentist, I put people
through a significant amount of

35:07.990 --> 35:08.990
pain.

35:08.990 --> 35:14.990
This is worse than that.

35:14.990 --> 35:17.990
>> Julie: John, sucked up into
the ufo.

35:17.990 --> 35:22.990
>> I hope I don't get imprel
pregnated by these aliens.

35:22.990 --> 35:28.990
Or get one of those chest bursts
later in the night.

35:28.990 --> 35:31.990
>> I climbed to the highest
mountains when I was 5 years

35:31.990 --> 35:31.990
old.

35:31.990 --> 35:33.990
So I was thinking this is going
to be a piece of cake.

35:33.990 --> 35:35.120
Not the case.

35:35.120 --> 35:39.290
It's terrifying and hard.

35:39.290 --> 35:40.990
>> Oh!

35:40.990 --> 35:45.990
(Screams)
>> Julie: Becky, that's got to

35:45.990 --> 35:49.990
hurt.

35:49.990 --> 35:50.950
>> Guys, we've got three people
left.

35:50.950 --> 35:52.990
>> I cannot believe I've made it
this far.

35:52.990 --> 35:54.990
You know, I don't have the
strongest arms, but I'm holding

35:54.990 --> 35:56.830
on with all my might.

35:56.830 --> 36:02.120
I might be able to pull out a
win here.

36:02.120 --> 36:06.410
>> I'm just trying to focus, and
all of a sudden, I'm just

36:06.410 --> 36:09.990
feeling myself slowly get
lifted.

36:09.990 --> 36:11.990
>> How do I get all the way up
here.

36:11.990 --> 36:13.990
>> Being lost in outer space
scares me.

36:13.990 --> 36:21.830
So I'm just going to hang on for
dear life.

36:21.830 --> 36:36.990
(Screams)
(Houseguests shouting)

36:36.990 --> 36:39.990
>> Julie: When we return, a
second head of household will be

36:39.990 --> 36:40.990
crowned.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.700
Plus, Phil's not done yet.

36:42.700 --> 36:43.990
His bb takeover continues.

36:43.990 --> 36:45.290
Stay with us.

36:45.290 --> 36:46.990
(Cheers and applause)
>> Oh, no!

37:03.990 --> 37:09.990
It's just me, little babe
Jason, and strong girl Jackie.

37:09.990 --> 37:18.990
I have a one in three chance of
becoming the second hoh.

37:18.990 --> 37:21.000
(Houseguests shouting ]
>> I'm just thinking, Liz, you

37:21.000 --> 37:21.990
have to stay on.

37:21.990 --> 37:22.990
You can do this.

37:22.990 --> 37:27.990
You can be beat little puny
Jason and Jackie is halfway up

37:27.990 --> 37:32.290
that garn pole so you got to
hang on.

37:32.290 --> 37:32.990
>> Poor Liz.

37:32.990 --> 37:34.990
She's hanging on by a pinky.

37:34.990 --> 37:39.990
This competition is literally
slipping through her fingers.

37:39.990 --> 37:45.990
(Houseguests shouting)
>> Bye, Liz.

37:45.990 --> 37:48.990
Hope you have fun with the
aliens.

37:48.990 --> 37:48.990
>> Damn, Liz.

37:48.990 --> 37:53.990
I thought you were a --
>> you did awesome.

37:53.990 --> 37:57.990
Ay.

37:57.990 --> 38:00.990
(Screams)
>> I'm using like my insides

38:00.990 --> 38:02.990
right now.

38:02.990 --> 38:02.990
>> Liz is gone.

38:02.990 --> 38:04.990
And now it's just me and Jason.

38:04.990 --> 38:09.830
I could actually win this.

38:09.830 --> 38:10.990
>> Looks cozy up there.

38:10.990 --> 38:11.830
It is comfortable.

38:11.830 --> 38:14.990
Jackie is basically
levitating at the top of the

38:14.990 --> 38:20.990
pole and it looks like she's
performing some kind of

38:20.990 --> 38:20.990
witchcraft.

38:20.990 --> 38:22.990
You look like a guru right now.

38:22.990 --> 38:27.120
If Jackie wins this, I think
that she has my back.

38:27.120 --> 38:31.990
If she's hoh, that's only good
for my game.

38:31.990 --> 38:34.830
>> Let's hope there's a few days
before the next damn

38:34.830 --> 38:34.990
competition.

38:34.990 --> 38:37.990
(Laughter)
You all going to wheel me

38:37.990 --> 38:37.990
around.

38:37.990 --> 38:40.990
>> You're not going to be able
to walk to the hoh room.

38:40.990 --> 38:45.700
>> Somebody is going to be
carrying my tired ass up to the

38:45.700 --> 38:45.990
chairs.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.000
I'm tired of stocking groceries
for no money.

38:48.000 --> 38:50.990
I'm not taking off this pole for
nothing.

38:50.990 --> 38:53.990
I don't even care if the cows
come home.

38:53.990 --> 38:57.990
(Cow moos ]
>> My legs are shaking.

38:57.990 --> 38:59.990
Jackie, you can drop anytime.

38:59.990 --> 39:02.700
I ain't putting you up, girl.

39:02.700 --> 39:02.990
>> Making deals.

39:02.990 --> 39:04.990
You promise?

39:04.990 --> 39:05.990
Promise, for sure.

39:05.990 --> 39:09.990
You had me at those shoes.

39:09.990 --> 39:11.700
>> Jackie, come on.

39:11.700 --> 39:12.290
Get off, Jackie.

39:12.290 --> 39:12.990
This is mine!

39:12.990 --> 39:14.990
Time for you to go, honey.

39:14.990 --> 39:15.990
You ain't need to worry about
me.

39:15.990 --> 39:18.410
So, please, remove yourself.

39:18.410 --> 39:19.830
>> You're doing great, baby.

39:19.830 --> 39:20.990
You're awesome.

39:20.990 --> 39:22.950
>> I'm about to blast off into
outer space.

39:22.950 --> 39:25.990
So this is a perfect deal at the
perfect time.

39:25.990 --> 39:28.410
>> I got you, girl.

39:28.410 --> 39:31.990
Too.

39:31.990 --> 39:41.990
(Screams)
>> Jackie!

39:41.990 --> 39:44.990
I just won the second hoh
comp of bb17.

39:44.990 --> 39:46.000
I don't usually win stuff.

39:46.000 --> 39:51.990
But here I am winning an
endurance contest.

39:51.990 --> 39:56.700
(Cheers)
>> Just because Miami safe with

39:56.700 --> 39:58.990
Jason doesn't mean I'm safe with
James.

39:58.990 --> 39:59.990
This is "big brother."

39:59.990 --> 40:01.990
Things happen every minute.

40:01.990 --> 40:07.990
(Cheers)
>> So Jason and James are both

40:07.990 --> 40:10.990
head of households, two dudes,
and we know how this works out

40:10.990 --> 40:11.990
every season.

40:11.990 --> 40:14.990
The dudes get in power.

40:14.990 --> 40:16.990
And send the girls packing.

40:16.990 --> 40:18.990
Not on my watch.

40:18.990 --> 40:21.990
I'm not having it.

40:21.990 --> 40:25.990
>> Julie: When we return, the bb
takeover continues as Phil

40:25.990 --> 40:27.990
surprises the houseguests once
again.

40:27.990 --> 40:28.990
Stay with us.

brother."

40:43.410 --> 40:46.290
James and Jason are in power,
but not for long.

40:46.290 --> 40:49.990
With the battle of the block
back in play, only one of them

40:49.990 --> 40:51.990
will be safe come eviction
night.

40:51.990 --> 40:57.990

this summer's bb takeover.
