00:18.453 --> 00:20.554
See?

00:20.556 --> 00:22.657
No jail cell can hold me.

00:27.062 --> 00:29.229
Uh, did he mean to do that?

00:35.070 --> 00:36.971
Right on schedule.

00:50.118 --> 00:52.954
- Jump!
- Y-You can't get any closer?

00:52.956 --> 00:56.324
- Raam's scared of heights.
- I? You're scared of heights.

00:56.326 --> 00:57.892
- You are!
- You!

00:57.894 --> 01:00.861
- No, you!
- No, you stop that!

01:01.463 --> 01:03.397
- Coming!
- Right!

01:03.399 --> 01:06.667
- You're scared of heights!
- You taught me to be scared!

01:06.669 --> 01:08.502
Hold on.
You're scared of heights.

01:08.504 --> 01:10.671
<i>Told you you're scared of heights.</i>

01:14.910 --> 01:17.678
Jabba! Trust me, it's gonna be great.

01:17.680 --> 01:20.147
Now, I listened to your
criticism from last time.

01:20.149 --> 01:23.184
I processed it, I thought about
it. I made some adjustments.

01:23.186 --> 01:26.087
So now, let me present
to you... Wait for it!

01:26.089 --> 01:30.157
Boom! Graballa's New and
Improved Beachside Resort!

01:30.159 --> 01:33.828
_

01:33.830 --> 01:36.197
"Boring"?

01:36.199 --> 01:37.733
How do you think that went?

01:37.734 --> 01:40.034
Because I kinda think
that could've gone better.

01:40.036 --> 01:41.502
Yep.

01:41.504 --> 01:45.539
Oh! Thanks for joining us.
And where have you been?

01:45.541 --> 01:48.976
Rotting in an Imperial jail.
Didn't you get my messages?

01:48.978 --> 01:51.846
<i>Graballa, it's Dengar. We ran
into some trouble on Bespin and...</i>

01:51.848 --> 01:53.432
Yeah, no. I didn't get any of those.

01:53.433 --> 01:57.151
- Look, I'm real busy, fellas.
- Too busy for this?

01:57.153 --> 02:00.239
I located that crystal-finding
kid you're looking for...

02:00.393 --> 02:03.524
- Rowan Freemaker.
- Oh!

02:03.625 --> 02:07.429
<b>1x07 - Race on Tatooine</b>

02:16.038 --> 02:18.773
_

02:21.643 --> 02:25.613
Let's run it down again.
Naare claims she's a Jedi,

02:25.614 --> 02:29.583
has a lightsaber,
can use the Force.

02:29.585 --> 02:34.088
But that Force-sensitive plant
from Felucia... Naare made it die.

02:34.090 --> 02:36.090
Which makes me wonder...

02:36.092 --> 02:40.227
Is she lying?
Is she... evil?

02:40.229 --> 02:45.266
And if she is,
my sister's right.

02:45.268 --> 02:46.846
Kordi won't rub it in.

02:46.847 --> 02:50.004
I won't get an "I told
ya so." Right, Roger?

02:50.006 --> 02:51.505
Roger?

02:53.341 --> 02:55.209
Sorry.

02:55.211 --> 02:58.679
I automatically shut down after
20 minutes of not listening.

02:58.681 --> 03:02.116
You were saying... uh, something?

03:02.118 --> 03:05.019
- Yeah. I think I have to tell Kordi...
- Tell me what?

03:05.021 --> 03:07.622
How you didn't hang the
astromech motivators, so they fell

03:07.623 --> 03:10.224
and broke and cost us credits
we cannot afford to lose?

03:10.226 --> 03:12.259
No, actually, I...

03:12.261 --> 03:16.397
- Told you that'd happen, Rowan.
- Yeah, you did.

03:16.399 --> 03:18.866
So, how are you going
to make this up to me?

03:18.868 --> 03:21.152
I don't know. It's not like I can clap

03:21.153 --> 03:23.437
my hands and make a paying job come in.

03:23.439 --> 03:27.114
Guess what!
A job just came in!

03:27.242 --> 03:29.827
Clap them again. Hurry.

03:30.445 --> 03:33.447
Blast! It was just a coincidence.
Go on.

03:34.282 --> 03:36.984
_

03:42.457 --> 03:44.625
Let's assume I don't speak Toong.

03:44.627 --> 03:46.627
- Who's that and what's the job?
- What?

03:46.629 --> 03:49.797
That is Ben Quadinaros,
galactic podracing champion.

03:49.799 --> 03:52.900
His pit crew came down
with a bad case of sand rot.

03:52.902 --> 03:56.874
- Oh, no! That's terrible!
- Oh, yeah, right.

03:57.002 --> 04:00.007
Terrible disease for them.
Great opportunity for us!

04:00.009 --> 04:02.127
<i>Ben wants us to come to Tatooine</i>

04:02.128 --> 04:04.245
and be his crew for a big race tomorrow!

04:05.580 --> 04:09.950
And he's paying a lot of
credits, so you can't say no.

04:09.952 --> 04:12.353
N... N...

04:12.355 --> 04:15.523
N...
He's right. I physically can't say it.

04:15.525 --> 04:21.161
Ha-ha! Yes!
# Podracer pod, podracer #

04:26.269 --> 04:28.536
<i>Agent Naare, report.</i>

04:28.538 --> 04:31.639
My lord, I've been working
diligently with Rowan and...

04:31.641 --> 04:33.909
<i>Eh, Naare, we can't hear you.</i>

04:33.910 --> 04:36.177
<i>Adjust your holo-transceiver.</i>

04:36.179 --> 04:39.647
Oh. Sorry, my lord. How about now?

04:39.649 --> 04:43.717
<i>- Now we can hear you.
- But we can't see you.</i>

04:43.719 --> 04:47.221
Oh, I... I don't know what's wrong. I...

04:47.223 --> 04:49.890
<i>You totally fell for it!</i>

04:49.892 --> 04:51.042
What?

04:51.043 --> 04:54.495
<i>We could see you and
hear you the entire time.</i>

04:54.497 --> 04:57.865
<i>Yes!</i>

04:57.867 --> 05:03.003
<i>Ha-ha! But my hilarious
prank makes a serious point.</i>

05:03.005 --> 05:06.207
<i>I don't want to hear excuses.</i>

05:06.209 --> 05:09.076
<i>I want to see results.</i>

05:09.078 --> 05:12.546
<i>Get me my Kyber Saber!
Now!</i>

05:12.548 --> 05:15.616
<i>Good talk.</i>

05:26.329 --> 05:29.363
Oh! My favorite caf mug?

05:29.365 --> 05:32.333
Ugh, today just gets better and better.

05:34.102 --> 05:38.706
Rowan, I really need you to reach
out with those feelings and...

05:38.708 --> 05:41.008
"Closed"?

05:46.549 --> 05:49.750
Uh, I really needed
some new load lifters.

05:49.752 --> 05:53.921
I'll just come back when
they're open.

05:53.923 --> 05:57.791
<i>Of all the jobs in all the systems,</i>

05:57.793 --> 06:02.196
why did this one have to
be on such a hot planet?

06:03.566 --> 06:07.568
Ugh!
No human can live like this!

06:07.570 --> 06:12.740
- This is the best job ever!
- Correction... no normal human.

06:12.742 --> 06:15.576
Hurry! Quadinaros will
be here at any second.

06:15.578 --> 06:18.145
Those pieces are not
gonna attach themselves.

06:19.648 --> 06:23.884
Kordi, look at that stabilizer vane.
It's totally bent.

06:25.821 --> 06:30.324
I'll go straighten it out while
you snap in these heat dissipaters.

06:30.326 --> 06:33.961
- Ugh! Is that what I sound like?
- Yeah.

06:33.963 --> 06:38.306
That is really annoying.
Hey, little Brother.

06:38.341 --> 06:41.135
Back at the shop?
I'm sorry I got on you.

06:41.137 --> 06:42.770
Thanks, Kordi.

06:42.772 --> 06:45.639
In fact, wasn't there
something you wanted to tell me?

06:45.641 --> 06:49.777
Yeah, there is. I'm
starting to worry that...

06:49.779 --> 06:52.646
_

06:52.648 --> 06:54.682
Yes, Mr. Quadinaros!
Here we are.

06:54.684 --> 06:57.751
And I know the race is in a few
minutes, but don't worry.

06:57.753 --> 06:59.520
We'll have your pod up and running.

06:59.522 --> 07:02.356
Now let's discuss my favorite
part, where you pay us.

07:02.358 --> 07:06.794
_

07:06.796 --> 07:09.163
Sure! We would love to
meet your sponsor, right?

07:09.165 --> 07:13.634
- Graballa!
- Did he just say...

07:13.636 --> 07:15.424
<i>Graballa?</i>

07:18.807 --> 07:21.709
- This isn't a job.
- It's a trap!

07:25.380 --> 07:29.450
- Did you set us up?
- Hey, whoa! I set you up.

07:29.452 --> 07:31.652
It's amazing what you can accomplish

07:31.654 --> 07:34.955
when you threaten to
snap off a guy's antennae.

07:34.957 --> 07:36.441
Run along, Benny.
You're done.

07:36.476 --> 07:38.403
<i>Sleemo.</i>

07:38.438 --> 07:39.460
I heard that!

07:39.462 --> 07:43.864
Now, would you like to discuss the
location of the Kyber Saber crystals?

07:43.866 --> 07:46.900
Uh, not really.
Actually, I'd like to just go.

07:46.902 --> 07:49.403
<i> Hey!</i>

07:49.405 --> 07:53.540
We can do this the easy way
or the Hutt way.

07:53.542 --> 07:56.910
<i>Graballa!</i>

07:56.912 --> 07:59.580
Oh. Hey, Jabba!
There's a guy!

07:59.581 --> 08:02.249
Fancy meeting you here!

08:02.251 --> 08:05.452
_

08:07.522 --> 08:10.280
Permission?
Since when do I need

08:10.315 --> 08:14.495
permission to come visit
my favorite-est cousin?

08:14.497 --> 08:16.697
<i>What a joker this guy
is, right? Come on!</i>

08:19.735 --> 08:23.404
- Boba!
- Dengar.

08:24.239 --> 08:26.073
Buddy! Why...

08:30.678 --> 08:32.946
Still wearing the ol' bedsheet, eh?

08:32.948 --> 08:35.349
What can I say?
It breathes.

08:35.351 --> 08:37.384
- How's your mother?
- Same ol', same ol'.

08:37.385 --> 08:40.721
Wishes I'd settle down and give
her some little bounty hunters.

08:40.722 --> 08:43.457
Well, at least you have a mother.
I'm a clone.

08:43.458 --> 08:45.526
Podracer.

08:45.528 --> 08:48.095
You're still thinking
about the blasted podrace?

08:48.097 --> 08:52.933
- We can escape on the podracer.
- Oh. Right.

08:54.402 --> 08:57.342
_

08:59.073 --> 09:03.076
Yes, of course I know what
happens to guys that cross you.

09:03.078 --> 09:05.312
I'm not some ignorant...

09:06.915 --> 09:09.049
You-You take that everywhere with you?

09:09.051 --> 09:11.618
It's just a little...
What's the word? Weird.

09:11.620 --> 09:14.721
<i>Just a little weird.
Look, Jabba, </i>

09:14.756 --> 09:17.591
this thing with me and the
boy doesn't concern you.

09:17.593 --> 09:19.560
_

09:19.562 --> 09:23.397
Which boy? He's right over my
right shoulder. He's right there.

09:24.966 --> 09:28.019
I'm not gonna turn around yet,
but I'm assuming

09:28.020 --> 09:28.936
he's not there, is he?

09:28.938 --> 09:32.940
And remember how Vader was
all, "No disintegrations"?

09:32.942 --> 09:36.076
They're getting away!
Again!

09:36.078 --> 09:38.011
Speeder bikes! Now!

09:42.350 --> 09:44.585
Roger! I can't see anything!

09:44.587 --> 09:47.639
Well, sorry, but it's
not like I had time

09:47.640 --> 09:50.782
- to pick my favorite seat!
- Move!

09:53.162 --> 09:57.598
For a so-called podrace expert,
you stink at driving one!

09:57.600 --> 09:59.056
Hey! It's not my fault.

09:59.057 --> 10:01.969
This is a one-seater,
but four of us are on it!

10:01.971 --> 10:05.038
Not for long.
Just stop this thing...

10:05.040 --> 10:07.708
- Don't stop! Don't stop!
- Hang on!

10:09.177 --> 10:12.012
Dengar's right behind us!
We need to lose him!

10:12.014 --> 10:14.314
Okay, okay, okay!
I think I got this.

10:18.152 --> 10:21.288
<i>Zander!</i>

10:26.661 --> 10:31.198
- What was that?
- It sounded like a signal horn.

10:31.200 --> 10:34.635
That's the race starting.
The race is starting.

10:35.737 --> 10:39.673
<i>Welcome to another
Mos Espa Raceway epic,</i>

10:39.675 --> 10:43.277
<i>the 29th Annual Brick Layers Classic.</i>

10:48.683 --> 10:50.651
<i>Podracer! </i>

10:53.072 --> 10:55.489
<i>Make that two late entries.</i>

11:00.161 --> 11:02.996
Uh, Dengar's still following us.

11:04.032 --> 11:06.133
- Shooting at us too!
- I noticed!

11:09.003 --> 11:12.272
- We are losing thrust.
- On it!

11:20.248 --> 11:23.984
- Blaster set for stun.
- Rowan! Duck!

11:24.519 --> 11:25.819
Waah!

11:36.397 --> 11:39.433
Yah!

11:39.435 --> 11:41.101
Waah!

11:41.103 --> 11:43.337
You look tired.
Here, let me drive.

11:53.815 --> 11:56.383
Yes!

12:02.290 --> 12:04.191
Kordi!

12:05.460 --> 12:08.261
I'm not seeing Dengar,

12:08.263 --> 12:12.299
so, you know, feel free to
drop out of this race any time!

12:12.301 --> 12:15.902
Drop out? When we're in fourth
place and closing on third?

12:15.904 --> 12:18.238
No!

12:27.515 --> 12:31.184
- Raam, you bash!
- And, Baash, you ram!

12:33.688 --> 12:37.557
Another hit like that,
and we'll be dead last!

12:58.113 --> 13:01.021
_

13:03.551 --> 13:05.719
These guys are the best I can afford.

13:05.721 --> 13:07.954
You play the sabacc hand you're dealt.

13:07.956 --> 13:10.724
Although, feel free to
say no, but I'm just...

13:10.726 --> 13:14.294
- No.
- No? Okay, fine. It was just an idea.

13:14.296 --> 13:16.329
<i>I don't believe it, folks!</i>

13:16.331 --> 13:19.166
<i>We have a new race team,
literally out of nowhere,</i>

13:19.168 --> 13:21.968
<i>neck-and-neck with Ben
Quadinaros for the lead!</i>

13:28.976 --> 13:33.113
<i>And another challenger's
trying his luck... on foot?</i>

13:37.586 --> 13:39.986
Whoa!

13:42.757 --> 13:46.493
Could really... use a... a lightsaber.

13:47.995 --> 13:50.597
Here!

13:50.599 --> 13:52.432
Good enough! Hyah!

13:54.602 --> 13:58.305
Kordi! That was a stabilizer
control module! I kinda need it to...

14:16.057 --> 14:18.959
_

14:18.961 --> 14:20.560
<i>Thank you!</i>

14:20.562 --> 14:24.097
The... Do we have a
name for these guys yet?

14:29.270 --> 14:31.371
I am the champion!

14:31.373 --> 14:32.973
- Look out!
- Whoa!

14:39.715 --> 14:43.683
Okay, I might've celebrated
a little too soon there.

14:45.153 --> 14:47.587
Ah, the racer's trashed.

14:47.589 --> 14:50.223
<i>We need to find somewhere to hide.</i>

14:50.225 --> 14:53.794
My sensors are picking up
a shelter. It's not far.

14:57.598 --> 14:59.800
Champion.

14:59.802 --> 15:01.802
<i>Yep. Here we are.</i>

15:01.804 --> 15:04.137
That was not "not far."

15:04.139 --> 15:08.341
I meant, "not far for a droid."
Did I say that part?

15:11.179 --> 15:14.481
Stuck in the desert.
No food. No water.

15:14.483 --> 15:16.449
No way back to the StarScavenger.

15:16.451 --> 15:18.852
We need a hero to rescue us.

15:18.854 --> 15:20.520
- Naare!
- Naare! We'll call her.

15:20.522 --> 15:25.292
- Or maybe we can do this ourselves.
- How do we reach her?

15:25.294 --> 15:29.031
Maybe we don't. Aren't you always
saying, "Who needs Naare?"

15:30.798 --> 15:33.466
I can rewire Roger's transmitter
pack for long distance.

15:33.468 --> 15:36.770
Sounds like a lot of work.
Let's just skip it.

15:36.772 --> 15:39.806
Great. Rewiring.
That never hurts.

15:39.808 --> 15:43.510
Short-circuit a guy one time,
and you never hear the end of it.

15:43.512 --> 15:45.712
<i>Utinni!</i>

15:47.215 --> 15:50.951
That's Jawa for, "We can
disguise ourselves as Jawas."

15:50.953 --> 15:54.133
- Done! Let's call Naare.
- Seriously?

15:54.168 --> 15:57.457
Can no one hear me?
Am I a ghost?

15:57.459 --> 15:59.893
Zander Freemaker calling Naare.

15:59.895 --> 16:01.061
<i>Come in, Naare.</i>

16:02.296 --> 16:03.997
Where could he have gone?

16:03.999 --> 16:06.700
<i>Naare! Come in, Naare.</i>

16:06.702 --> 16:08.401
Zander. Is that you?

16:08.403 --> 16:13.673
<i>Hey, Naare! You sound good.
What's new with you?</i>

16:13.675 --> 16:15.642
<i>Oh, give me that thing.</i>

16:15.644 --> 16:17.495
<i>Naare, can you hear me?</i>

16:17.496 --> 16:19.346
<i>We need your help! Please!</i>

16:19.348 --> 16:23.416
Kordi. Kordi? You're breaking up.
Is Rowan with you?

16:23.418 --> 16:26.280
<i>We're on Tatooine. You've
gotta track the signal</i>

16:26.281 --> 16:29.890
<i>and come get us! Only you can...</i>

16:29.892 --> 16:34.728
- Um, they found us.
- Think Naare got the message?

16:34.730 --> 16:36.963
I hope so.
And I hope she flies fast.

16:43.905 --> 16:47.173
Give it up, Freemakers.
There's no escape.

16:47.175 --> 16:49.376
My men have you surrounded.

16:49.378 --> 16:51.578
Are you sure your men can handle it?

16:51.580 --> 16:54.547
Can you believe he tried to
hire Boba Fett for this gig?

16:54.549 --> 16:59.519
Can you blame me?
I mean, come on! It's Boba Fett!

16:59.521 --> 17:02.522
We've gotta find something
to fight with. Stall.

17:02.524 --> 17:04.025
Whoo-hoo! Hey!

17:04.026 --> 17:07.027
<i>Graballa, we're all
business people here.</i>

17:07.029 --> 17:09.796
<i>So let's do our business
thing and negotiate.</i>

17:09.798 --> 17:13.032
Sure. Absolutely.
All I really want is the kid.

17:13.035 --> 17:15.535
Send him down, or I blow you up.

17:15.537 --> 17:20.701
Okay, we'll call that your opening
position. How firm are you on that?

17:21.608 --> 17:24.944
- Pretty firm.
- Ugh. Broken Gaffi Sticks.

17:24.946 --> 17:26.946
Moldy Jawa food.

17:26.949 --> 17:29.616
- There's nothing I can work with.
- How 'bout these?

17:29.618 --> 17:33.553
Thermal detonators?
That I can work with.

17:33.555 --> 17:36.556
Time's up! Go get the boy.

17:36.558 --> 17:39.092
What?
You want me to say I'm sorry?

17:39.094 --> 17:42.395
Fine. I'm sorry I
tried to hire Boba Fett

17:42.397 --> 17:45.665
because you three have
proven over and over

17:45.667 --> 17:49.975
to be way too incompetent
to grab one lousy kid!

17:50.071 --> 17:52.038
Apology accepted.

17:55.176 --> 17:57.410
Oh, boy.

18:03.985 --> 18:06.553
Yeah! Keep 'em coming.

18:12.026 --> 18:15.195
Next time, I offer Boba Fett double.

18:16.297 --> 18:18.932
Whoo! We've got 'em on the run!
Give me another!

18:18.934 --> 18:21.167
That was the last one.

18:21.169 --> 18:23.169
<i>They're out of ammo! Move in!</i>

18:45.359 --> 18:47.560
Hey! Naare got our message!

18:47.562 --> 18:49.329
Wait, wait, wait. How do I look?

18:49.331 --> 18:53.867
I can't believe I'm saying
this, but... Yay, Naare!

18:53.869 --> 18:57.070
Yeah. Um, "yay, Naare."

19:14.922 --> 19:17.123
Gotcha now, Jedi!

19:25.266 --> 19:26.833
<i>Oh! Wow!</i>

19:36.877 --> 19:40.013
What was I thinking? How could
I have ever doubted Naare?

19:40.015 --> 19:42.482
Freemakers!
To the Eclipse Fighter! Now!

19:45.286 --> 19:47.187
There he is! Get that kid!

19:47.189 --> 19:49.422
Are you paying anything
for the other kids?

19:49.424 --> 19:52.592
What? Yes-Yes! Fine!
Whatever! But I want that kid!

19:57.031 --> 19:59.332
- Hey!
- Kordi!

20:01.235 --> 20:03.870
Stop! I'm a vintage collectible.

20:03.872 --> 20:05.538
Kordi! Zander!

20:05.540 --> 20:07.907
- Rowan, no!
- Whoa!

20:07.909 --> 20:10.043
I will handle this.

20:18.319 --> 20:20.053
Go!

20:21.889 --> 20:23.423
I gotta help Naare.

20:23.425 --> 20:26.059
Maybe she has something here I can use.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.667
- I love her.
- I know.

20:34.669 --> 20:36.336
A lightsaber!

20:38.272 --> 20:40.573
Red? But that's the color of...

20:40.575 --> 20:42.442
<i>Naare! Are you there?</i>

20:43.945 --> 20:46.646
<i>Ugh, I hate it when
it goes to holo-mail.</i>

20:46.648 --> 20:49.082
<i>Listen, I've been thinking.</i>

20:49.084 --> 20:52.485
<i>If this Rowan kid isn't
leading you to the crystals,</i>

20:52.487 --> 20:57.768
<i>then Sith up and slice up his family!
That'll motivate him.</i>

20:58.360 --> 21:01.161
<i>"Sith up."
I'm so good.</i>

21:01.163 --> 21:03.863
Naare... is a Sith?

21:03.865 --> 21:08.045
- Naare is a hero!
- Get us out of here!

21:11.939 --> 21:14.674
They're getting away!
Again!

21:14.676 --> 21:16.276
For like what? What's that?

21:16.277 --> 21:17.877
The third time? The fourth?

21:17.879 --> 21:22.782
- I've literally lost count!
- Uh, are we counting today only?

21:27.688 --> 21:29.522
Quick! To the skiff!

21:35.362 --> 21:39.165
- You know what the worst part is?
- The kid got away?

21:39.167 --> 21:41.434
I gotta call Jabba to pick us up.

21:45.873 --> 21:48.741
<i>And then when you took
out that guy with one move!</i>

21:48.743 --> 21:51.224
That was amazing! You're amazing.

21:51.225 --> 21:55.515
- Isn't she amazing, Rowan?
- Yeah. Amazing.

21:55.517 --> 21:59.485
I feel like I need to give you a hug.
Can I give you a hug?

21:59.487 --> 22:03.556
- Oh, actually, I'd prefer... Ooh!
- Me too.

22:03.558 --> 22:06.593
We can let go anytime now.

22:06.595 --> 22:08.861
Enough hugging already!

22:08.863 --> 22:10.877
Fortunately, we're all safe.

22:10.878 --> 22:13.900
But it could have turned
out much differently.

22:13.902 --> 22:15.836
That is why you must never,

22:15.837 --> 22:18.738
ever go anywhere without me, Rowan.

22:18.740 --> 22:22.374
You never know
what dangers await you.
