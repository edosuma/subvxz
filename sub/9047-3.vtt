00:02.335 --> 00:03.569
- Previously on <i>awkward...</i>

00:03.570 --> 00:05.437
I'm not pregnant--totally
thought I was, but I'm not.

00:05.439 --> 00:07.539
- Why didn't you tell me
you thought you were pregnant?

00:07.541 --> 00:08.907
- I'm not.
- I can respect that

00:08.909 --> 00:10.342
You didn't want
to talk about it before,

00:10.344 --> 00:12.811
So can you please respect that I
don't want to talk about it now?

00:12.813 --> 00:15.447
Good night, jenna.

00:18.018 --> 00:18.951
[school bell rings]

00:18.953 --> 00:20.519
- It had been a week
since matty found out

00:20.521 --> 00:21.787
About the pregnancy scare,

00:21.789 --> 00:24.156
And he seemed to be doing
everything in his power

00:24.158 --> 00:27.292
To ensure
we didn't have another.

00:29.229 --> 00:30.562
Is everything okay?

00:30.564 --> 00:31.430
- Sure, babe.

00:31.432 --> 00:33.532
- He kept insisting
everything was fine,

00:33.534 --> 00:35.534
But his actions
said otherwise.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.435
It was weird.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.070
We weren't talking,
we weren't doing it,

00:38.072 --> 00:39.905
And what was worse,
we weren't talking

00:39.907 --> 00:40.873
About not doing it.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.375
Our communication was
at an all-time low.

00:43.377 --> 00:44.810
- Hold it right there.

00:44.812 --> 00:48.414
In light of the tragic
and untimely demise

00:48.416 --> 00:49.281
Of ricky schwartz,

00:49.283 --> 00:50.983
I am taking
precautionary measures

00:50.985 --> 00:53.819
To make our school
a peanut-free zone.

00:53.821 --> 00:58.624
Or rather, a pea-not zone.

00:59.392 --> 01:01.260
Are you in possession
of any nuts

01:01.262 --> 01:04.629
Or nut-related products?

01:04.632 --> 01:08.834
I'll be confiscating this.

01:13.173 --> 01:15.541
Nut check.

01:18.278 --> 01:20.646
All clear.

01:21.147 --> 01:24.216
I'm gonna have to stop you
right there, j.

01:24.218 --> 01:27.219
When was the last time
you had a nut in your mouth?

01:27.221 --> 01:30.289
- It was a good question.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.893
Okay, I'm not saying
I'm at an 11

01:34.895 --> 01:37.162
On the panic meter,
but I am inching towards a 7.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.431
Something is definitely off
in my relationship.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.133
- I'd say
it's pretty clearblue easy.

01:41.135 --> 01:43.135
Matty's freaked out
over the pregnancy scare.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.403
- How did you know
about that?

01:44.405 --> 01:45.804
- Jake and I
tell each other everything.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.806
- That's unhealthy.
And creepy.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.208
Next thing you know,
you'll be one

01:49.210 --> 01:50.642
Of those couples
who shares an email.

01:50.644 --> 01:53.345
- But even more shocking
than the potential mama drama

01:53.347 --> 01:54.780
Is that it came
from jake's mouth.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.714
- I'm sorry.

01:55.716 --> 01:56.748
I was gonna tell you.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.117
I tried to call--
- it's chills.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.085
I'm already over it.
- I get it, j.

02:00.087 --> 02:03.155
There are certain things
we should keep to ourselves.

02:03.157 --> 02:05.591
- What things?
- Just things.

02:05.593 --> 02:06.758
- Back to the hot topic
at hand,

02:06.760 --> 02:08.526
I know you and matty
are all action, no talk,

02:08.529 --> 02:10.562
But have you asked him
if everything's cool?

02:10.564 --> 02:12.564
- Of course I did.
- What did he say?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.133
- "sure, babe."
[both gasp]

02:14.135 --> 02:15.567
- He "sure-babed" you?

02:15.569 --> 02:16.768
"sure, babe"
is one step away

02:16.770 --> 02:18.470
From "whatever, honey,"
which is the gateway phrase

02:18.472 --> 02:21.073
To "take care,"
which we all know is the end.

02:21.075 --> 02:24.109
- Okay, now I'm at an 11.

02:26.779 --> 02:29.581
- If you dipsters seriously
think I killed ricky,

02:29.583 --> 02:33.085
Your iqs must be
as small as your--

02:33.087 --> 02:34.920
[bleep] it.

02:34.922 --> 02:37.055
I'm perfectly fine
eating alone.

02:37.057 --> 02:39.758
Go have lunch with hamil-tramp.
- I don't feel like it.

02:39.760 --> 02:41.460
I'd rather hang with you.

02:41.462 --> 02:43.662
Why aren't you eating?

02:43.664 --> 02:46.331
- I guess my murder rap
made me lose my appetite.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.667
Ever since ricky bit it,
everyone's afraid of me.

02:48.669 --> 02:51.570
Even that airbag, lissa,
is keeping her distance.

02:51.572 --> 02:52.838
- You poor thing.
- I know.

02:52.840 --> 02:55.240
I haven't outed anybody,
made anyone transfer,

02:55.242 --> 02:57.142
Or said the word harelip

02:57.144 --> 02:58.810
In three days.
- Come on, sades.

02:58.812 --> 02:59.945
This is all gonna blow over.

02:59.947 --> 03:01.446
No one really thinks
you're a murderer.

03:01.448 --> 03:03.415
- Miss saxton,
this is p.I. Mulville,

03:03.417 --> 03:05.184
Stands for
personal investigator.

03:05.186 --> 03:06.151
- Private investigator.

03:06.153 --> 03:07.619
- We're gonna have
to take you downtown

03:07.621 --> 03:08.820
To answer some questions.

03:08.822 --> 03:13.058
And by downtown,
I mean my office.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.226
- You better eat
your granola bar

03:14.228 --> 03:15.761
Before it's confiscated
by the nut patrol.

03:15.763 --> 03:18.730
- While I had no idea what
was going on in matty's head,

03:18.732 --> 03:22.067
Jake knew what tamara
packed for lunch.

03:24.204 --> 03:27.472
- Henry.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.045
- Am I having a seizure,

03:33.047 --> 03:34.646
Or did some weird stuff
just go down?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.915
- You guys,
this is my boyfriend henry.

03:36.917 --> 03:39.585
We're in love.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.386
- If every couple had
a different way of interfacing,

03:41.388 --> 03:45.257
Matty and I were somewhere
in the middle of the spectrum.

03:45.259 --> 03:48.160
Maybe the way to get us
back on track

03:48.162 --> 03:49.661
Was to go back to basics--

03:49.663 --> 03:52.364
Sex in a forbidden place,

03:52.366 --> 03:53.966
Where one of us was likely
to come out

03:53.968 --> 03:56.535
The other end needing
a tetanus shot.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.636
But it was worth the risk

03:57.638 --> 03:59.871
Because the make out
had stopped the freak out.

03:59.873 --> 04:02.140
With matty and me,
getting some action

04:02.142 --> 04:04.009
Always spoke louder
than words.

04:04.011 --> 04:08.880
- ♪ oh, I

04:08.882 --> 04:12.551
- I've got to get to class,
but this was fun.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.453
- That's it?
- We can hang out tonight.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.688
- I had no reason
to be insecurious.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.957
We were longer sophomores
at sex.

04:18.959 --> 04:19.791
We were juniors.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.728
And as such, we were going
to take our time.

04:22.730 --> 04:23.762
Yeah, let's hang out.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.064
- Cool.
Then we can talk.

04:26.066 --> 04:29.167
- It was time to stop worrying
and start freaking.

04:29.169 --> 04:32.738
Matty wanted to talk.

04:35.041 --> 04:35.807
- Whoo!

04:35.809 --> 04:36.875
Was that good for you?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.744
Yeah, that was good
for me too.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.513
Aw, damn.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.950
[laughs]
thanks for the tune-up.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.185

in the sanctuary.

04:47.187 --> 04:48.220
- Word sure travels fast.

04:48.222 --> 04:51.556
- So are you and henry in love?
- We're soul mates.

04:51.558 --> 04:52.591
- Where did you two meet?

04:52.593 --> 04:54.026
- In line waiting
for the new iphone.

04:54.028 --> 04:55.560
- What's henry's middle name?
- Bao-zhi.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.695
It means "full of wisdom."

04:56.697 --> 04:58.096
- Boxers or briefs?
- Beckhams.

04:58.098 --> 04:59.765
- I didn't think henry
was your type.

I thought you liked

05:06.073 --> 05:08.974
- Fred wu.
I know you know I know him.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.342
- Oh, right.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.610
I know everything about you

05:11.612 --> 05:12.844
Because your life
is so fascinating.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.780
I can't help but follow
every little thing

05:14.782 --> 05:17.015
That's happening in it.
- Hmm.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.684
- I'm kidding.

05:18.686 --> 05:22.020
[laughter]

05:28.628 --> 05:31.229
How long did
henry wear braces?

05:31.231 --> 05:34.099
- Trick question.
He never wore them.

[both speaking mandarin]

05:37.905 --> 05:41.773

05:47.013 --> 05:49.748

ricky schwartz died?

05:49.750 --> 05:52.884
- Hell if I know.
Home, I guess.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.021
- Is there anyone
who can corroborate your alibi?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.123
- We're not convinced
there was any foul play.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.292
We are just trying
to get some clarity.

06:00.294 --> 06:03.428
There was evidence of, uh,

06:03.430 --> 06:05.564
Sexual nature at the scene.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.665
- Ricky was a man whore,

06:06.667 --> 06:10.635
Which means there are probably,
like, 300 suspects.

06:10.637 --> 06:12.070
- If we called your folks,

06:12.072 --> 06:13.705
Would they confirm
you were home that night?

06:13.707 --> 06:15.707
- Don't call my parents.

06:15.709 --> 06:17.976
Call my lawyer.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.979
- You got a problem with us
calling your parents?

06:20.981 --> 06:23.348
- No, but I have
a problem with you.

06:23.350 --> 06:24.249
I'm curious.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.184
Do you and your sister wives
rotate clothing,

06:26.186 --> 06:28.920
Or is that your own
personal peasant skirt?

06:28.922 --> 06:31.556
- Deflecting--
an obvious sign of guilt.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.393
- I can put an end
to this bitch hunt right now.

06:34.395 --> 06:37.162
Can we have some privacy?
- You mind waiting outside?

06:37.164 --> 06:40.866
- Not from him,
from you.

06:44.537 --> 06:47.139
I didn't sleep
with that [bleep],

06:47.141 --> 06:48.240
And a test will prove it.

06:48.242 --> 06:50.942
- Sweetie, we don't have money
for fancy lie detectors.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.178
- No, genius.
A pap smear.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.513
I'm a virgin.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.615
But be warned.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.651
If you actually force me
to do that,

I will sue you,

07:10.063 --> 07:12.097
I don't think
you killed ricky.

07:12.099 --> 07:16.301
But I get why people
think you did.

07:20.940 --> 07:23.442
- No wonder
she's such a grumpster.

07:23.444 --> 07:24.976
Girl needs to get laid.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.312

to get laid, he wants to talk.

07:27.314 --> 07:28.680
I can't be alone with him.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.715
I am not emotionally prepared
for the talk right now.

07:30.717 --> 07:33.018
I need another day
to process.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.553
Wait.
I have an idea.

07:34.555 --> 07:37.456
What's that thing that
you've been begging me to do

07:37.458 --> 07:38.523
Since we were kids?

07:38.525 --> 07:41.293
- [gasps]
bfgfbff!

07:41.295 --> 07:44.896
I have been dreaming
about this since I was six.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.531
And then I met you,
and then you met matty,

07:46.533 --> 07:48.033
And then you met jake,
and then you cheated

07:48.035 --> 07:49.734
On jake with matty,
and then I started dating jake,

07:49.736 --> 07:52.838
And now you're with matty,
and here we are.

07:52.840 --> 07:56.074
Our whole lives have been
building up to this moment.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.642
Bfgfbff--

07:57.644 --> 07:59.344
The boyfriend-girlfriend-
best-friends-forever

07:59.346 --> 08:00.612
Double date.
The d-d is implied.

08:00.614 --> 08:03.482
- That is completely insane,
and I am all in.

08:03.484 --> 08:05.817
- Yes! I'll call you later
with a plan.

08:05.819 --> 08:09.221
- Sure, I was using
the bfgfbff

08:09.223 --> 08:10.388
As a security blanket.

08:10.390 --> 08:12.257
But as long
as I wasn't alone with matty,

08:12.259 --> 08:15.360
I didn't have to have the talk.
[car horn honks]

08:15.362 --> 08:16.661
- Hamilton.
Get in.

08:16.663 --> 08:19.331

like walking.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.131
And not talking.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.833
- I've got your favorite candy.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.504
Into that convo
with sugary treats.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.073
No, thanks.
- Hop in. I'll take you home.

Stranger danger.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.315
To know what he wanted
to talk about.

08:37.317 --> 08:41.285
Actually, I can't.

- I swear, okay?

18:01.714 --> 18:02.880
- This family stuff sucks.

18:02.882 --> 18:04.182
You know I've been there.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.384
But you're strong.
You're gonna be okay.

18:06.386 --> 18:08.719
- I am?
- Definitely.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.721
And there's no way in hell
you could take me.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.825
- Why don't you come over here
and prove it?

18:13.827 --> 18:15.026
- I would swing by,

18:15.028 --> 18:19.764
But I have to have
a conversation with jenna.

18:19.766 --> 18:23.201
- So have it.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.239
- I gotta go.

18:28.241 --> 18:30.007
- I know you've been wanting
to have this talk all day,

18:30.009 --> 18:31.576
And I'm sorry
I've been avoiding it.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.644
But if this is gonna be the talk
where you break up with me,

18:33.646 --> 18:35.046
Then we are not having
this talk

18:35.048 --> 18:36.314
Because I am breaking up
with you first.

18:36.316 --> 18:37.448
So there.
Talk over.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.984
- That's not this talk.

18:39.986 --> 18:44.188
- Good.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.189
What's going on?

18:45.191 --> 18:47.959
- Last week you didn't want me
to touch you,

18:47.961 --> 18:54.031
And then today you wanted
to do it in the sanctuary.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.134
- Are you upset
that I didn't tell you

18:56.136 --> 18:57.235
About the pregnancy sitch?

18:57.237 --> 18:59.871
- No, I'm upset
that you told jake before me.

18:59.873 --> 19:04.942
And that we don't have
that thing you and jake had.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.277
Have.
- What thing?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.246
A friendship?
- I guess, yeah.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.247
Why can't we have that?

19:09.249 --> 19:10.982
Why can't I be that for you?
- Be what?

19:10.984 --> 19:12.717
- The guy you don't
have to sleep with

19:12.719 --> 19:13.985
To be connected to, jenna.

19:13.987 --> 19:18.289
The guy
you can say anything to.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.558
- I'm sorry
I told jake.

19:20.560 --> 19:23.661
He was just there,
and it came out.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.062
- That is
exactly the point.

19:25.064 --> 19:27.231
It's always so easy
with jake.

19:27.233 --> 19:30.935
Why is it not easy
with me?

19:34.373 --> 19:38.176
- I guess
I'm just always afraid

19:38.178 --> 19:41.345
The minute anything bad happens,
you're gonna run away.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.780
- Why would you think that?

19:42.782 --> 19:45.183
- Because you were
embarrassed of me.

19:45.185 --> 19:46.584
- When?

19:46.586 --> 19:48.686
- After we first had sex.

19:48.688 --> 19:49.954
We never talked.

19:49.956 --> 19:51.189
We just hooked up.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.690
And then when we did talk,

19:52.692 --> 19:54.792
It was only in private.

19:54.794 --> 20:01.499
I'd call that embarrassment,
wouldn't you?

20:01.501 --> 20:03.434
- No.

20:03.436 --> 20:06.604
I was never embarrassed
of you.

We're having sex.
Gotta go, bye.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.712

how your parents are broke.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.747
