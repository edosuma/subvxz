00:53.156 --> 00:57.946
And ready, here we go.
Five, four, three, two...

00:58.436 --> 01:00.427
Good evening. Tragedy in Taiwan.

01:00.596 --> 01:03.508
Disaster in Denmark.
Mayhem in Malaysia.

01:03.676 --> 01:05.746
Those stories and more coming up later.

01:05.916 --> 01:08.828
Tonight's lead story:
The computer game phenomenon...

01:08.996 --> 01:13.069
distributed by alleged Russian
Mafia leader Konstantine Konali...

01:13.236 --> 01:18.185
has taken the world by storm.
Out of the cold climates of Russia...

01:18.356 --> 01:20.745
comes the hottest
computer game sensation...

01:20.956 --> 01:22.867
simply called "The Game. " Ed?

01:23.916 --> 01:27.670
- Ed, what are you doing?
- You gotta try this game. It's great.

01:28.556 --> 01:30.751
Not now, Ed.
In the past six months...

01:30.916 --> 01:34.750
"The Game" has generated
over $ 1 .5 billion in revenue...

01:34.916 --> 01:39.194
- Breaking all previous records.
- Get him, you miserable bear!

01:39.356 --> 01:43.110
What makes this game stand out?
This is the first time that a video game...

01:43.276 --> 01:45.073
- has appealed to a youthful...
- Ed!

01:45.236 --> 01:47.147
As well as a more sophisticated market.

01:47.316 --> 01:50.114
- Oh, sh...
- "The Game, " available in cartridges...

01:50.276 --> 01:53.393
as well as floppy disks for computer,
has everybody playing.

01:53.556 --> 01:55.069
Take it, Lindsay, take it.

01:55.236 --> 01:59.354
The creator and mass-marketer
of "The Game" is Konstantine Konali...

01:59.516 --> 02:02.872
- Allegedly head of the Russian Mafia.
- No, no, no!

02:03.036 --> 02:06.108
Konali and...
What is he up to in Moscow?

02:06.276 --> 02:07.504
Get your hands off it.

02:07.676 --> 02:10.270
- Get your hands off the game!
- I want that game!

02:10.716 --> 02:14.391
I'm not giving you my game!
Give it to me!

02:14.556 --> 02:17.150
- You're through at this station.
- You're through.

02:46.996 --> 02:49.351
Misha, take care of Skippy.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.189
Ay.

02:57.356 --> 02:59.392
Leonid, Leonid, Leonid.

02:59.876 --> 03:04.188
Enough living in the shadows.

03:11.436 --> 03:13.074
Someday...

03:14.396 --> 03:18.150
this will all...

03:18.716 --> 03:20.911
be mine!

03:22.396 --> 03:25.911
- This crime problem is out of hand.
- Yes, Boris Nikolayevich.

03:26.076 --> 03:28.032
We need help.

03:28.196 --> 03:31.393
I can recommend a man I met
during the international conference.

03:31.556 --> 03:34.195
I understand he has already
had dealings with Konali...

03:34.356 --> 03:35.675
when Konali was in America.

03:35.836 --> 03:38.191
I will make this very clear.

03:38.356 --> 03:41.746
Can he help us get Konali?

03:41.916 --> 03:46.785
Yes, Boris Nikolayevich.
He is just the man for the job.

03:46.956 --> 03:49.470
Keep me informed.

04:26.676 --> 04:28.075
Oh.

04:29.596 --> 04:31.587
There you are, son.

04:36.516 --> 04:38.074
How are the new recruits doing?

04:38.236 --> 04:41.069
It might be the best class ever,
except for one man.

04:41.316 --> 04:45.309
- He's afraid of heights.
- See what you can do for him.

04:45.476 --> 04:50.709
I find that sometimes the least likely
cadets make the finest police officers.

04:50.876 --> 04:52.912
Commandant Lassard, throw us the ball.

04:56.436 --> 04:57.664
Off the scoreboard...

04:58.196 --> 05:00.630
off the floor, off the wall...

05:00.796 --> 05:02.070
off the redhead.

05:02.676 --> 05:03.950
Nothing but net.

05:15.716 --> 05:19.675
- Not bad.
- I love this game.

05:24.356 --> 05:25.948
Connors. Where's Connors?

05:26.156 --> 05:28.431
Thanks, Connors. You fixed it.

05:30.556 --> 05:32.308
That's a classified police file.

05:32.476 --> 05:36.105
"The academy has assembled a special
team for a mission to Moscow. ."

05:36.276 --> 05:38.392
I'd kill for that job.

05:39.876 --> 05:41.628
Webster's on the list. Why him?

05:41.796 --> 05:43.912
Because he graduated first in our class.

05:46.516 --> 05:48.871
Yeah, well...

05:49.596 --> 05:50.995
can he do this?

05:53.516 --> 05:54.835
Yep.

05:55.676 --> 05:57.109
Can he do this?

05:59.516 --> 06:02.474
- Yep.
- That's all I got.

06:08.036 --> 06:09.355
What are you doing?

06:09.556 --> 06:13.435
- Well, I've never been to Russia.
- Okay, now put it back.

06:13.596 --> 06:15.632
Connors. Sergeant wants you.

06:16.476 --> 06:19.149
- Yeah.
- Now.

06:28.916 --> 06:32.545
I'm so very, very glad to see you.

06:32.876 --> 06:35.913
The Moscow police
have asked us to assist them...

06:36.076 --> 06:39.864
- In apprehending Konstantine Konali.
- Russkies?

06:40.076 --> 06:42.670
The godfather of Russian
organized crime.

06:43.276 --> 06:44.789
Men...

06:46.236 --> 06:48.033
Six years ago...

06:48.196 --> 06:51.666
Konali helped to establish a branch
of the Russian Mafia here...

06:51.836 --> 06:54.066
in our country.

06:54.236 --> 06:55.988
Nearly got him then.

06:56.156 --> 07:00.627
Unfortunately, he slipped through our
fingers and escaped back to Moscow...

07:00.796 --> 07:03.356
where he continues
his criminal activities...

07:03.516 --> 07:08.192
aided by his brother Mikhail
and pet snake Skippy.

07:10.116 --> 07:11.344
Home run!

07:11.516 --> 07:16.431
Now we get another chance
to apprehend him.

07:24.876 --> 07:26.150
Man, what a wimp.

07:29.116 --> 07:32.313
Connors, get down here.
You're never gonna pass the test.

07:32.476 --> 07:34.910
I've gotta pass. My father was a cop.

07:35.076 --> 07:38.671
His father was a cop.
His father was a horse thief.

07:38.836 --> 07:42.146
- You got vertigo. Let's go.
- Vertigo. Ha!

07:42.356 --> 07:43.709
I don't have vertigo.

07:43.876 --> 07:45.628
Yo, Connors, you want a doughnut?

07:48.796 --> 07:51.105
- Not bad.
- Connors, let's face it.

07:51.276 --> 07:54.029
You don't have what it takes
to be a cop.

07:54.196 --> 07:56.312
Take this to Commandant
Lassard's office.

07:56.476 --> 08:00.355
- He'll sign off on your dismissal papers.
- Bummer, dude.

08:00.516 --> 08:01.744
Now, I want you to meet...

08:03.316 --> 08:05.034
a new addition to our team.

08:06.596 --> 08:08.427
- You must be Cadet Connors.
- Hi.

08:08.596 --> 08:11.986
I'm very, very impressed by your file.

08:12.156 --> 08:13.908
- Cadet Kyle Connors.
- Mm.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.590
Top grade average in the class.

08:16.756 --> 08:18.667
Sir, I have to tell you something.

08:18.996 --> 08:21.112
Congratulations.

08:21.276 --> 08:24.268
Thanks, but I'm not really the man
in that file.

08:24.436 --> 08:26.347
Oh, I know what you mean.

08:26.516 --> 08:30.509
These reports never do give
an accurate picture of who we really are.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.871
Yes, but...

08:36.676 --> 08:37.904
What the hell is this?

08:43.716 --> 08:46.071
Come on, come on. Come on.

08:50.396 --> 08:53.513
- Let's all pull together.
- Okay.

08:55.636 --> 09:00.346
Okay, all together, on three!
One, two, three!

09:04.316 --> 09:06.034
- Oh, God.
- Sir!

09:06.236 --> 09:10.115
Captain Harris, our expert in
surveillance, will be accompanying us.

09:10.276 --> 09:12.744
Team, we're all off to Russia...

09:12.916 --> 09:15.874
to kick many, many butt-skis.

09:37.756 --> 09:41.066
Alexander Nikolaivitch.

09:49.396 --> 09:50.875
Men...

09:51.316 --> 09:56.913
this is the honorable Commandant
Alexander Nikolaivitch Rakov.

09:57.476 --> 09:59.785
- Sasha.
- May I say it is an honor...

09:59.956 --> 10:03.187
to have the great Commandant
Lassard visiting our country?

10:03.356 --> 10:05.426
- Yes, you may.
- May I kiss you again?

10:05.596 --> 10:07.871
- No, you may not.
- May I escort you inside?

10:08.036 --> 10:09.310
Yes, you may.

10:10.556 --> 10:13.195
It is really wonderful
to have you here in Russia.

10:13.356 --> 10:15.312
Please say hello to your lovely wife...

10:15.476 --> 10:17.626
and tell her I'm sorry
she's not here with you.

10:19.196 --> 10:20.993
Yes. Lieutenant Yuri Talinsky.

10:21.156 --> 10:23.750
Head of our organized crime unit.

10:24.556 --> 10:28.913
Please, don't underestimate
the power of the Russian Mafia...

10:29.076 --> 10:32.068
the most sadistic organization
in the world.

10:32.596 --> 10:33.915
Katya.

10:38.556 --> 10:40.672
This is Sergeant Katya Sergei.

10:40.836 --> 10:43.669
She has been handpicked
to be your guide and translator.

10:43.836 --> 10:46.714
Lieutenant Talinsky,
I hold you personally responsible...

10:46.876 --> 10:50.710
for the comfort and safety of the
Americans and Commandant Lassard.

10:50.996 --> 10:54.591
- Yes, sir.
- Now, Americans and Russians...

10:54.876 --> 10:57.549
we must grab Konali
like the insect that he is...

10:57.716 --> 10:59.991
and we must then crush him!

11:00.796 --> 11:03.151
- God.
- Make way. Jones. Jones.

11:03.316 --> 11:04.829
- Jones. Make way. Make way.
- Oh!

11:04.996 --> 11:07.669
I am Captain Thaddeus Harris
and in this case...

11:07.836 --> 11:10.748
I have state-of-the-art
American surveillance equipment.

11:10.916 --> 11:14.147
I'll have this Konali business
wrapped up for you in a few days.

11:14.796 --> 11:18.311
Excuse me, Ricky.
I must go to the toilet.

11:18.476 --> 11:19.750
Yes, of course.

11:20.076 --> 11:22.988
- Pardon me. Which is my car?
- The one in front.

11:23.196 --> 11:25.869
The one in front. Oh, yeah.

11:29.716 --> 11:32.310
- What did he say?
- Well, he said that you had...

11:32.476 --> 11:36.788
a marvelous attitude and you're
a pleasure to work with, sir.

11:38.396 --> 11:41.149
I'm going to keep my eye on you.

11:44.556 --> 11:49.072
The red zone
is for Communist parking only.

11:51.676 --> 11:53.632
The one in front.

11:53.796 --> 11:58.108
The red zone
is for Communist parking only.

11:58.276 --> 12:00.426
Oh, hello.

12:00.796 --> 12:03.833
Lieutenant Talinsky didn't
tell me his family would be here.

12:03.996 --> 12:06.430
Very nice of you to come and greet me.

12:06.756 --> 12:10.715
Katrina, I want you to think of me
as America's goodwill ambassador.

12:10.876 --> 12:13.515
And you think of me
as translator and guide.

12:19.916 --> 12:23.113
Stop! Stop!

12:23.276 --> 12:26.871
Ay! Ay-yai-yai-yai-yai.

12:27.196 --> 12:28.709
I'm in deep borscht.

12:47.756 --> 12:52.955
Captain Callahan, 511.
Sergeant Jones, 513.

12:53.116 --> 12:58.873
Sergeant Tackleberry, 514.
Cadet Connors, 520.

12:59.036 --> 13:02.745
Captain Harris, 515.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.271
Not exactly a four-star hotel, is it?

13:05.436 --> 13:08.553
Well, we spend our police budget
on fighting criminals...

13:08.716 --> 13:10.786
not on pampering
out-of-town visitors.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.912
Your government brought us here.

13:13.076 --> 13:14.987
They also bring in monkeys for zoo...

13:15.156 --> 13:18.512
but we don't put them
in four-star hotel either.

13:19.796 --> 13:23.550
Well, I just go check
on Commandant Lassard.

13:29.476 --> 13:32.468
Lassard. Lassard. You!

13:35.676 --> 13:36.950
You.

13:37.396 --> 13:39.785
You.

13:46.436 --> 13:49.189
I have job for you.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.906
Again. When you hear door,
you say:

13:53.076 --> 13:55.112
"I'm in the bathroom.
I'll meet you there. ."

13:55.316 --> 13:58.706
"I'm in the bathroom. Meet me there. ."

14:00.516 --> 14:01.790
Again.

14:01.956 --> 14:06.029
"I'm in the bathroom.
I'll meet you there. ."

14:06.196 --> 14:10.155
"I'm in the bathroom.
Meet you there. ."

14:14.396 --> 14:16.068
Come in.

14:17.796 --> 14:19.309
Again!

14:20.796 --> 14:25.267
"In the bathroom. Meet me there. ."

14:30.996 --> 14:32.987
Excuse me.
Is the commandant in?

14:33.156 --> 14:38.310
Well, I just saw him. He's very tired
and enjoying moment of rest.

14:38.476 --> 14:39.704
Thank you.

14:49.116 --> 14:52.870
I have to get to next level.

14:56.956 --> 15:01.666
- Looking for something, captain?
- Bugs. You can never be too careful.

15:01.836 --> 15:05.272
- Call me paranoid.
- You're paranoid.

15:05.756 --> 15:08.873
I'm down to one life. I can't make it.

15:09.196 --> 15:11.073
Can I show you a little trick?

15:13.556 --> 15:16.787
Watch. You just want the bear
to go back three spaces. Right?

15:20.396 --> 15:21.749
See?

15:23.636 --> 15:26.025
It makes it to next level.

15:26.196 --> 15:28.266
- I made it. Thank you.
- Game.

15:32.276 --> 15:34.028
Good morning, everyone.

15:37.356 --> 15:40.746
I understand that your commandant
will not be joining us today.

15:40.916 --> 15:43.874
However, we will proceed
with briefing anyway.

15:44.676 --> 15:48.066
Konstantine Konali,
Russian Mafia godfather.

15:50.396 --> 15:51.795
Jones!

15:54.516 --> 15:57.872
His brother and second-in-command,
Mikhail Konali.

16:07.876 --> 16:11.346
Konstantine Konali is involved
in extortion...

16:11.516 --> 16:14.508
gambling, fencing jewelry,
arms dealing.

16:14.676 --> 16:16.553
But he does not choose
to involve himself...

16:18.116 --> 16:21.188
- Too much cabbage.
- In day-to-day running of operations...

16:21.356 --> 16:24.632
which makes it rather difficult
to catch him. However...

16:24.836 --> 16:28.226
we know three places
that he frequents regularly.

16:28.436 --> 16:29.949
One: his restaurant...

16:30.116 --> 16:32.505
where he conducts meetings
in back of office.

16:32.676 --> 16:34.906
Two: his dacha. And three:

16:35.076 --> 16:36.509
Hello. Hello.

16:36.676 --> 16:41.386
His warehouse, where he conducts
legitimate video games business. Now...

16:43.196 --> 16:45.585
we believe Konali
is up to something big.

16:45.756 --> 16:49.351
Unfortunately, attempts
to infiltrate his operations have failed...

16:49.516 --> 16:54.067
but we will now work together
and we will capture Konali.

17:12.476 --> 17:14.353
Excuse me.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.267
Adam.

17:18.435 --> 17:20.074
So good to see you.

17:20.236 --> 17:23.830
Thank you for inviting me, Mr. Konali.
However, your delivery service...

17:23.996 --> 17:26.829
leaves a little bit to be desired.

17:26.996 --> 17:30.875
I have the perfect plan,
but I need your help.

17:31.036 --> 17:34.073
- My help?
- I want you to design a program...

17:34.236 --> 17:37.546
that will bypass any computer
security system in the world...

17:37.716 --> 17:40.469
letting me have access to secret files.

17:40.636 --> 17:42.194
You're talking about...

17:42.996 --> 17:45.351
- A passkey?
- Bingo.

17:45.836 --> 17:48.350
- Nothing like this exists.
- Create it.

17:49.956 --> 17:52.629
I want to be able to tap
into the world's banks...

17:52.796 --> 17:57.824
manipulate the world's stock markets,
know what heads of countries know.

17:57.996 --> 18:00.430
We could control the world!

18:00.596 --> 18:03.952
Louder, Misha. I don't think
all of Moscow heard you.

18:04.116 --> 18:09.429
Even if I did create this passkey,
how will you get it into their computers?

18:09.636 --> 18:11.592
I have already thought of that.

18:11.756 --> 18:17.513
You, my dear Adam, will design
a new version of "The Game. ".

18:17.796 --> 18:19.787
We will call it...

18:21.396 --> 18:23.751
"The New Game. ".

18:23.916 --> 18:26.510
And we will put the passkey in it.

18:26.676 --> 18:29.907
When you slip it into your computer,
bada-bing!

18:30.076 --> 18:34.547
I will have access to impenetrable files.
Pretty good, no?

18:36.356 --> 18:38.233
Lassard.

18:38.436 --> 18:41.428
Bah! Yankee police.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.912
Boys, watch them.

18:49.076 --> 18:51.271
I want to know their every move.

18:54.716 --> 18:57.105
Good luck, babushka.

19:00.276 --> 19:04.394
"In the bathroom. Meet you there.
In the...

19:04.556 --> 19:06.069
In the bathroom. " Yes."

19:10.236 --> 19:12.067
Sir, we have to go now.

19:14.996 --> 19:16.668
- Sir?
- In the bathroom.

19:16.996 --> 19:20.386
- Meet you there.
- Is everything okay?

19:20.556 --> 19:25.630
The commandant is having
some problems adjusting.

19:25.796 --> 19:27.548
- He's gonna meet us there.
- Oh.

19:32.436 --> 19:35.712
You know, in America,
funerals are in English.

19:35.876 --> 19:37.707
This where you live?

19:38.716 --> 19:40.354
Good day.

19:45.876 --> 19:47.104
I have a fish.

19:49.516 --> 19:51.234
He lives in a bowl too.

19:55.356 --> 19:58.826
You have a lovely, lovely apartment.

19:59.436 --> 20:03.349
Somehow, I feel quite at home here.

20:03.516 --> 20:05.427
A Russki police academy.
What a joke.

20:08.436 --> 20:11.030
In Lassard's absence,
I will do all the talking.

20:11.196 --> 20:13.915
You'll say nothing, do nothing,
watch your every move.

20:14.076 --> 20:17.307
Be on your toes.
Any false move could embarrass us all.

20:17.476 --> 20:19.068
And don't trust these guys.

20:19.236 --> 20:21.955
Just because we're buddy-buddy
with them now...

20:22.116 --> 20:25.267
don't forget they
were our sworn enemies just...

20:27.676 --> 20:30.395
Just a little while ago.

20:30.956 --> 20:33.868
- Move it. Move it, move it.
- Moron.

20:34.236 --> 20:38.024
The topic for today is
police field tactics.

20:38.356 --> 20:40.916
The Russian and the American approach.

20:41.076 --> 20:43.670
American police. Good.

20:44.356 --> 20:47.553
Perhaps you can tell us
about apprehending criminals.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.509
- Me?
- You. You.

21:03.916 --> 21:05.395
Goodness' sakes.

21:06.236 --> 21:07.589
- Major.
- Sergeant.

21:07.756 --> 21:11.351
Class, this is Sergeant Tackleberry.

21:13.436 --> 21:16.348
Okay. You know, as cops...

21:16.516 --> 21:18.347
I don't have to tell you this.

21:18.516 --> 21:20.984
It's tough to uphold the law,
but in the States...

21:21.156 --> 21:24.831
we have to deal with constantly
changing police regulations.

21:24.996 --> 21:28.705
I mean, take for example
the excessive force issue.

21:29.476 --> 21:32.866
- I could use a volunteer.
- Tackleberry, what are you doing?

21:33.036 --> 21:34.469
I am in charge here.

21:34.636 --> 21:37.469
Captain Harris,
perhaps you should demonstrate.

21:37.636 --> 21:41.311
- Well, that's more like it.
- Back in the old days...

21:41.476 --> 21:45.105
there wasn't anything you couldn't do
trying to apprehend a perpetrator.

21:45.436 --> 21:48.872
Take for example
the highly effective chokehold.

21:49.036 --> 21:50.549
Tackleberry!

21:50.716 --> 21:54.550
Well, nowadays this is considered
to be excessive force.

21:57.356 --> 21:58.789
Or...

21:58.956 --> 22:03.268
the ever-dependable,
always reliable PK-24 police baton...

22:03.436 --> 22:06.109
which, with a single blow
to the body...

22:06.276 --> 22:08.028
say to the lower thigh...

22:10.476 --> 22:13.752
Renders a subject
completely incapacitated.

22:15.516 --> 22:16.949
But, no, no.

22:17.116 --> 22:21.109
Nowadays this too is considered
to be excessive force.

22:24.716 --> 22:26.832
They want me to uphold the law...

22:26.996 --> 22:29.829
but they tie my hands.

22:32.516 --> 22:35.076
Fortunately...

22:36.076 --> 22:38.874
there's always Old Reliable.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.474
Why mess with success?

22:44.596 --> 22:46.871
Thanks.

22:49.076 --> 22:50.304
Have you seen Lassard?

22:51.956 --> 22:53.548
I have had it with you losers.

22:53.716 --> 22:56.913
I will capture Konali
because I use my head.

22:57.076 --> 23:00.546
- Yeah, right.
- Think we can lose him?

23:01.516 --> 23:05.225
Excuse me.
Is possible you help me?

23:05.396 --> 23:07.990
Sure.

23:08.156 --> 23:10.989
Why don't you guys run along
and I'll catch up with you later.

23:11.156 --> 23:14.068
Sure.

23:18.876 --> 23:20.832
Katrina, how can I help you?

23:20.996 --> 23:23.749
You ever want something
so badly it hurts?

23:24.156 --> 23:26.989
- Yes.
- And no matter how much you wait...

23:27.156 --> 23:30.865
and hope and wait more,
you don't get what you want?

23:31.036 --> 23:32.754
Well, yeah.

23:32.916 --> 23:37.910
But my advice is don't give up.
Just go for it.

23:39.036 --> 23:42.312
- I want...
- Thattagirl. Follow your heart.

23:43.316 --> 23:45.955
- I want...
- Say it.

23:47.236 --> 23:49.227
- I want my vacation.
- What's that?

23:49.396 --> 23:53.469
I wait three years. Three years.
Then you Americans come.

23:53.636 --> 23:55.388
Talinsky, he assign me to you.

23:55.556 --> 23:58.070
Now I can't go.

23:59.516 --> 24:01.268
I have plan.

24:01.436 --> 24:03.950
Connors, I don't leave you...

24:05.996 --> 24:07.793
without anyone.

24:07.996 --> 24:11.545
Come. I select suitable replacement
for you.

24:11.716 --> 24:14.071
She's best in department.

24:15.476 --> 24:17.671
Yeah, I'm sure she is.

24:17.876 --> 24:21.266
Look, all I know is Lassard
disappear at airport.

24:21.436 --> 24:25.588
Organize search, find Lassard,
but keep quiet.

24:25.796 --> 24:27.787
- What are you doing here?
- Just browsing.

24:29.356 --> 24:34.066
Hey, Yuri, that translator, Katrina?
Very good. She's excellent.

24:34.236 --> 24:36.067
All our people are excellent.

24:36.236 --> 24:39.433
For instance, this is lrina Petrovskaya.

24:39.596 --> 24:41.746
She is expert in forensics.

24:41.916 --> 24:44.225
She can tell you everything
about person...

24:44.396 --> 24:46.751
just by looking at one hair from head.

24:51.876 --> 24:57.189
My observations conclude
this man is picky eater...

24:57.436 --> 24:58.789
afraid of heights...

25:00.116 --> 25:03.392
- And still a virgin.
- What?

25:06.476 --> 25:08.114
I'm not a picky eater.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.549
Cadet Connors is also a forensics expert.

25:12.716 --> 25:16.106
Maybe you'd be so generous
as to share with us your expertise.

25:16.276 --> 25:21.304
- Sure.
- This one puzzles us.

25:21.476 --> 25:25.913
We were able to remove only one
fingerprint from scene of crime.

25:26.076 --> 25:27.907
This is our only clue...

25:28.076 --> 25:29.634
to identity of criminal.

25:30.236 --> 25:31.715
Okey-dokey.

25:34.796 --> 25:37.026
No wonder you're puzzled.
This glass is all cracked.

25:38.236 --> 25:39.749
Enough!

25:40.876 --> 25:43.674
Next assignment, Chernobyl.

25:43.916 --> 25:45.554
Excuse me, lieutenant...

25:45.716 --> 25:49.345
but the chief said you and your men
would be available to us.

25:50.196 --> 25:56.385
Absolutely, Captain Callahan,
and I have just the men for you.

26:04.596 --> 26:06.314
These guys are cops?

26:07.116 --> 26:09.789
You get the feeling that
we're not wanted here?

26:09.956 --> 26:11.833
I'll tell you what we need to do.

26:11.996 --> 26:14.669
- We need to let Konali know we're here.
- On his turf.

26:14.836 --> 26:17.145
- Hit him where it hurts.
- I like that.

26:17.316 --> 26:19.466
- Get in his face.
- Kick some butt.

26:19.636 --> 26:20.864
Better get Katrina.

26:31.876 --> 26:35.152
Hey, bud. Nice work.

26:35.316 --> 26:38.308
It would be a shame
to see this all go up in smoke.

26:38.476 --> 26:40.831
- How do you mean?
- Accidents happen.

26:40.996 --> 26:43.351
Fire breaks out,
beam gives way, workers...

26:43.516 --> 26:44.790
Get out.

26:44.956 --> 26:47.424
Tell Konali I won't pay
his extortion money.

26:53.516 --> 26:58.385
Hey, buddy. Commandant Lassard
sends his regards.

26:59.196 --> 27:03.189
I can't tell you how it makes me feel...

27:03.356 --> 27:08.191
to be received so very, very
generously into your family.

27:24.156 --> 27:25.555
Oh.

27:50.116 --> 27:51.993
I'll take matters into my own hands.

27:52.156 --> 27:53.748
What is he doing?

28:03.996 --> 28:07.511
- Sir, would you like to have lunch?
- Meet me in the bedroom.

28:09.316 --> 28:10.544
In the bathroom.

28:11.596 --> 28:14.064
- Sir?
- Meet me there!

28:14.236 --> 28:16.625
Meet you there! Meet you there!

28:18.876 --> 28:21.026
This sewer stinks.

28:25.516 --> 28:30.385
So Americans leave
without saying goodbye.

28:30.556 --> 28:34.390
Russians say goodbye
without leaving.

28:42.516 --> 28:44.632
Oh, allow me.

28:56.156 --> 28:57.589
This went rancid.

29:11.116 --> 29:12.595
I promise you this:

29:12.756 --> 29:15.224
After today, Konali's gonna know
this cop's in town.

29:15.396 --> 29:19.184
This is a typical Russian bathhouse.

29:23.636 --> 29:25.945
Okay. So this is Konali's sauna.

29:26.116 --> 29:29.745
It's just a front. People come here
to fence stolen jewels.

29:29.916 --> 29:32.476
All right. Let's get naked.

29:32.636 --> 29:34.627
Come on. Come on.

29:48.516 --> 29:49.744
Hello, ladies.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.588
Hi.

29:57.756 --> 29:59.508
Nice place you got here.

30:12.636 --> 30:13.864
Freeze!

30:17.516 --> 30:20.826
You may resume...

30:20.996 --> 30:23.908
whatever it is you were doing.

30:28.876 --> 30:32.710
Okay, okay. I should be
right under Konali's restaurant.

30:47.036 --> 30:50.392
- Did you like the necklace?
- Oh, yes, my pushki.

30:50.556 --> 30:54.629
- How much?
- In fact, it is all that I am wearing.

30:54.796 --> 30:56.275
I decided that from now on...

30:56.436 --> 31:00.952
I will only wear diamonds,
diamonds and diamonds.

31:02.556 --> 31:04.990
- Yes.
- Really?

31:05.156 --> 31:08.353
- I'm going to see you later, right?
- Oh, I hope so.

31:08.516 --> 31:10.825
I'm going to bring you big surprise.

31:11.316 --> 31:13.591
- What?
- How about Big Skippy?

31:13.756 --> 31:15.986
- I love Big Skippy.
- And Little Skippy.

31:16.156 --> 31:17.908
No, not the little one.

31:18.076 --> 31:21.466
- He bothers me.
- All right. I call you later.

31:21.636 --> 31:24.628
Hey, move it. Down in front.

31:32.036 --> 31:34.789
Mr. Konali, we've got bad news.

31:34.956 --> 31:36.230
It's American police.

31:36.396 --> 31:40.184
They're messing
with our operation again.

31:46.236 --> 31:48.670
No more. You hear me?

31:51.436 --> 31:55.827
As of this moment I am putting
a contract out on Lassard and his team!

31:55.996 --> 31:57.987
We squash them!

31:59.716 --> 32:02.105
My fish, Swimmy Lassard.

32:02.276 --> 32:05.268
He eats at this time every day.

32:12.156 --> 32:15.193
This will be fun, Vlady.

32:36.596 --> 32:38.348
Hey, you little punk, get lost!

32:38.516 --> 32:41.588
Hey, spread out!

32:43.276 --> 32:45.187
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:45.356 --> 32:48.507
Listen, just because they're good on bikes
doesn't make them nice guys.

32:48.676 --> 32:50.871
Man, look at you. Come on.

32:53.556 --> 32:55.194
This one's for you, kid.

32:55.356 --> 32:57.586
Now, check this.

33:06.596 --> 33:08.393
There. Don't miss.

33:21.676 --> 33:23.075
Vlady, get up.

33:27.676 --> 33:31.669
I hate dogs. I'm gonna shoot every dog
I ever see.

33:42.196 --> 33:46.269
What have we got here?
A match with a red line through...

34:17.116 --> 34:19.583
I've been here for 30 minutes.

34:19.755 --> 34:22.031
Shouldn't we see if Konali's inside?

34:23.596 --> 34:24.949
The Russian work ethic.

34:25.116 --> 34:27.676
You know, Katrina,
you take this job too seriously.

34:27.835 --> 34:29.952
You have to learn to loosen up.

34:30.116 --> 34:32.676
I want to loosen up.

34:32.835 --> 34:35.509
Had vacation planned. Go to beach.

34:35.676 --> 34:38.554
Now I sit on bench here with you.

34:38.716 --> 34:40.627
You sure you speak with Talinsky?

34:41.356 --> 34:45.349
- Da, Talinsky.
- I not understand.

34:45.516 --> 34:47.427
I should not be here.

34:47.596 --> 34:52.716
Well, you know, Katrina, sometimes
you have to expect the unexpected.

34:57.516 --> 34:59.711
- I know your type.
- My type?

35:00.156 --> 35:03.751
You just like to hunt fox.
You like the chase.

35:03.916 --> 35:08.228
Katrina, go out with me tonight.
Just one date.

35:08.516 --> 35:11.269
Give me a chance.

35:14.876 --> 35:17.436
I go out with you tonight.

35:17.596 --> 35:18.949
Excellent.

35:19.196 --> 35:20.948
Ladies and gentlemen.

35:23.156 --> 35:24.953
I would like to introduce to you...

35:25.116 --> 35:29.667
the world-famous
circus family, Zemskova.

35:40.316 --> 35:42.386
It's the Zemskov family. They're great.

35:47.036 --> 35:49.914
They've been doing this act
for over 100 years.

35:50.076 --> 35:52.829
They look amazingly spry for their age.

35:55.836 --> 35:58.225
The Zemskov family
passed the act down...

35:58.396 --> 36:01.194
from grandfather to father
to son and daughter.

36:01.356 --> 36:04.075
It's tradition. Keep secrets in family.

36:15.636 --> 36:18.070
Maybe that's one they should
keep a secret.

36:18.236 --> 36:21.308
One more of those, it could be
the end of the Zemskov family.

36:32.196 --> 36:36.986
And now lvan Zemskovi
will perform the impossible!

36:37.636 --> 36:41.265
The triple Salto Mortale.

36:51.356 --> 36:53.631
Ivan Zemskovi!

36:53.916 --> 36:55.190
I know.

36:55.356 --> 36:57.426
- Know what?
- You lie.

36:57.596 --> 37:00.793
You tell me you get me
off case as translator.

37:00.956 --> 37:03.424
- I'm sorry?
- Instead you tell Talinsky...

37:03.596 --> 37:06.872
I'm great translator.
Translation:

37:07.036 --> 37:09.425
No vacation for me.

37:09.596 --> 37:11.268
So...

37:11.436 --> 37:13.711
tonight I get even. Da?

37:13.876 --> 37:19.030
Let's hear it for the great
artist family, Zemskov.

37:25.196 --> 37:29.747
Ladies and gentlemen,
lgor and Andrusha.

37:29.956 --> 37:33.266
Excuse me. I have to go
to the little clowns' room.

37:35.076 --> 37:37.510
Get him.

37:38.036 --> 37:41.028
No, no, no, no.
No, no, I'd like to, but I...

37:41.196 --> 37:43.152
No, no.

37:43.316 --> 37:47.070
I'll come back in five minutes.
I will. I promise you.

37:47.716 --> 37:50.105
What is that? Is this gonna hurt?

37:50.276 --> 37:52.836
It's not even lubricated.

38:18.596 --> 38:20.587
Don't you clowns
know when to stop?

38:20.756 --> 38:24.874
Let's do it. Don't be afraid.
Close your eyes.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.186
Everybody, quiet!

38:33.036 --> 38:36.472
All right, listen here, Bozo...

38:54.436 --> 38:57.553
Don't forget, you're the one
that called us for help, buster.

38:57.716 --> 39:00.708
Well, excuse me, buster,
but I didn't place the call.

39:04.556 --> 39:07.195
Great, great subway. Terrific.

39:07.356 --> 39:11.349
I mean, New York is a shithouse,
but this is great.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.746
Well, have you been able
to capture Konali?

39:13.916 --> 39:15.429
We were this close.

39:22.076 --> 39:25.068
Listen to me and use my equipment,
you can capture him in two days.

39:25.236 --> 39:26.669
Na, na, na, na, na, na.

39:27.436 --> 39:28.835
Na, na, na, na, na, na?

39:35.236 --> 39:36.635
Nah.

39:37.116 --> 39:38.515
Nah.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.674
- What about this Russian food?
- You want borscht? We stop.

39:41.836 --> 39:43.155
I don't want any borscht.

39:43.476 --> 39:46.354
So now we're even. Da?

39:46.516 --> 39:49.986
Katrina, no. I had a wonderful time.

39:50.156 --> 39:52.795
All right. I had an awful time
and I almost hurled...

39:52.956 --> 39:56.392
but at least I got to spend
some time with you.

39:57.076 --> 40:00.227
I had good time too.

40:01.276 --> 40:03.187
I'm sorry for what I did.
I just...

40:03.356 --> 40:07.235
I just wanted to keep you around.

40:08.076 --> 40:10.465
It's okay.

40:11.436 --> 40:14.075
What are you thinking about?

40:14.236 --> 40:16.830
What's Russian for "kiss me"?

40:18.796 --> 40:21.356
I whisper it.

40:33.636 --> 40:37.424
It doesn't seem to lose anything
in the translation.

40:40.276 --> 40:42.346
You know, Konali...

40:42.516 --> 40:45.553
he's done many bad things.

40:45.916 --> 40:47.668
But he brought you here.

40:49.436 --> 40:51.825
Where does Konali hang out at night?

40:51.996 --> 40:56.035
- The casino.
- Suddenly I feel the need to gamble.

41:01.916 --> 41:05.431
No more bets, please. No more bets.

41:06.876 --> 41:09.913
Mr. Konali, always a pleasure
to see you, sir.

41:10.076 --> 41:12.795
Jacquot, would you show Mr. Konali
to his table?

41:14.316 --> 41:15.829
That's him.

41:15.996 --> 41:18.146
Place your bets.

41:18.316 --> 41:21.592
- Have a nice evening, sir.
- What if he finds out you're cop?

41:21.756 --> 41:25.465
Oh, he will, when I arrest him.

41:26.316 --> 41:30.195
Bartender, margarita, please.

41:48.876 --> 41:52.949
- There you go, Monsieur Bond.
- How about a Perrier in a bottle?

42:44.236 --> 42:45.635
Not bad Mr. Konali?

42:45.796 --> 42:48.629
Never before have I seen
such an apparition.

42:48.796 --> 42:51.105
Let's get up.

42:51.276 --> 42:53.426
Right.

42:54.156 --> 42:56.624
Such a vision of womanhood.

43:49.996 --> 43:52.908
- Oh, yeah.
- Mr. Konali, meet Debbie.

43:53.076 --> 43:57.627
Debbie. The name sings to me.

43:58.076 --> 44:00.954
Debbie.

44:02.196 --> 44:03.629
Yeah!

44:05.036 --> 44:08.312
I'd say she's in. Be right back.

44:18.116 --> 44:22.234
- Could I get an autograph?
- Hey, the boss is busy.

44:22.396 --> 44:25.832
- Sorry. This'll only take a second.
- I said, the boss is busy.

44:25.996 --> 44:29.352
- Oh, God.
- I tell you what. Why don't we...

44:29.516 --> 44:31.825
Why don't we flip for it?
If I win...

44:31.996 --> 44:33.588
I get the autograph.

44:33.756 --> 44:35.872
If you win, I go away.

44:36.036 --> 44:37.754
Ready? Call it.

44:45.116 --> 44:47.391
If you could just
make it out to Freddie.

44:47.556 --> 44:48.784
Hey, kid.

44:49.116 --> 44:52.074
- You got a job?
- No. I'm just here for the herring.

44:52.796 --> 44:54.388
You should come work for me.

44:57.396 --> 44:59.990
Kid like you can go far.

45:00.156 --> 45:03.193
Do you offer a dental plan?

45:05.876 --> 45:07.867
I love this kid!

45:08.036 --> 45:09.674
Well, well, well.

45:09.836 --> 45:13.192
You can all go and play
your little undercover games...

45:13.356 --> 45:16.792
and when the time is right,
I will arrest Konali.

45:30.796 --> 45:32.991
I want to show you picture
of my baby.

45:34.556 --> 45:36.274
This is the day I brought her home.

45:37.836 --> 45:40.066
Here she is at 10,000 miles.

45:40.236 --> 45:42.955
And this is after her first tune-up.

45:44.636 --> 45:46.513
Nice car.

45:49.716 --> 45:53.834
- Do you own or lease?
- Everything I touch...

45:53.996 --> 45:55.827
I own.

45:58.436 --> 46:01.746
You must have an awfully large payroll.

46:02.556 --> 46:04.512
Enough about me.

46:07.636 --> 46:09.547
Tell me...

46:09.716 --> 46:12.230
is that your real hair?

46:13.836 --> 46:17.272
Everything about me is real.

46:18.956 --> 46:20.184
Really?

46:21.956 --> 46:23.184
Really.

46:23.356 --> 46:27.269
I want to know all about you.
I find you fascinating.

46:27.436 --> 46:30.189
We have an appointment with destiny.

46:31.236 --> 46:32.555
But not tonight.

46:34.076 --> 46:35.589
When?

46:36.396 --> 46:38.227
Tomorrow.

46:39.956 --> 46:41.833
Coffee and cake.

46:42.396 --> 46:44.068
I send my car for you.

46:44.836 --> 46:46.474
Nice car.

47:12.436 --> 47:15.508
Commandant Lassard!

47:16.116 --> 47:18.835
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

47:19.156 --> 47:22.034
- Give me a cigarette.
- Did you see Konali's girlfriend?

47:22.196 --> 47:24.664
American-ski.

47:27.276 --> 47:29.585
Oh, nice tie-ski.

47:36.596 --> 47:39.668
Okay, get me some vodka.

47:59.956 --> 48:01.275
Damn!

48:01.436 --> 48:05.475
Why don't you try
"from Russia with love"?

48:08.476 --> 48:11.195
"Russia with love. ."

48:12.116 --> 48:14.152
- Who are you?
- None of your business.

48:14.316 --> 48:16.625
- What are you doing here?
- Playing games.

48:17.756 --> 48:20.475
Hey, knock it off.

48:21.916 --> 48:23.827
Hey, cut it out.

48:24.316 --> 48:26.193
I know what you want...

48:26.356 --> 48:28.472
but you can't have it.

48:29.716 --> 48:31.707
- What's wrong with you?
- Did you know...

48:31.876 --> 48:36.233
that I have been in this room
for 72 hours straight with no food?

48:36.956 --> 48:39.345
Just me...

48:40.396 --> 48:41.749
and the bear.

48:41.916 --> 48:43.827
No food?

48:44.236 --> 48:45.715
No.

48:45.876 --> 48:47.070
Nuts?

48:49.436 --> 48:52.473
- Your little game is over.
- No, not yet.

48:52.636 --> 48:54.911
Tomorrow it'll all be over...

48:55.316 --> 48:57.750
and Konali will have the power.

48:57.916 --> 49:00.476
Could you let me up now, please?

49:00.636 --> 49:02.467
I'm on kind of a deadline.

49:06.316 --> 49:08.068
And with Konali...

49:08.236 --> 49:11.194
he takes "deadline" literally.

49:15.196 --> 49:17.505
I'm about to show the world
something bigger...

49:17.676 --> 49:20.873
than they have ever seen
in their puny existence.

49:21.036 --> 49:23.186
But...

49:23.956 --> 49:27.346
I want to show you my thing first.

49:28.116 --> 49:31.267
Is it something I could
wrap around my neck?

49:31.636 --> 49:33.149
You're warm.

49:33.316 --> 49:36.991
Is it something I could play with?

49:37.156 --> 49:41.274
- You're getting warmer.
- Oh, the suspense is killing me, Koni.

49:41.436 --> 49:44.951
- Tell me what it is.
- It's a game!

49:45.956 --> 49:47.867
But not just any game.

49:48.036 --> 49:49.913
New version of old game...

49:50.076 --> 49:52.909
Where I become big winner...

49:53.076 --> 49:56.466
- With the help of a secret key.
- Secret key?

49:56.636 --> 49:58.547
Key?

50:00.636 --> 50:02.706
What are you doing?

50:03.916 --> 50:05.747
Nothing.

50:05.916 --> 50:08.066
Boss wants his computer key
from his office.

50:08.236 --> 50:10.511
It's not here.
It's at his other office...

50:10.676 --> 50:12.792
in the restaurant.

50:13.236 --> 50:14.715
Bye.

50:48.116 --> 50:50.550
That's a laser grid.
We set one foot on that floor...

50:50.716 --> 50:53.184
and every alarm
in this place goes off.

50:53.356 --> 50:56.075
We've got to get to that
cutoff switch over there.

51:35.036 --> 51:38.073
Hey, Tack, I got it.

51:39.196 --> 51:42.666
Okay, stand back. There's only one way
to get this safe open.

51:42.836 --> 51:47.068
Wait a minute. You blow that thing,
Konali's gonna know we were here.

51:47.236 --> 51:50.831
What are we gonna do?

52:13.236 --> 52:15.227
You're amazing.

52:17.596 --> 52:19.473
There's no key in here.

52:33.996 --> 52:35.668
Keys!

52:35.836 --> 52:39.033
- Move, you little weasel.
- Don't hurt me, okay...

52:40.636 --> 52:43.355
- Hey!
- Adam.

52:44.396 --> 52:47.672
- You have game?
- Sure.

52:48.236 --> 52:50.704
I surpassed myself. This game...

52:50.876 --> 52:53.026
will be even bigger
than the last one.

52:53.196 --> 52:55.915
The world is mine.

52:57.276 --> 52:59.836
Go run off a dozen copies.
We have to test it.

52:59.996 --> 53:03.875
Send it to some of our
more dedicated game players:

53:04.036 --> 53:05.992
The president, the mayor...

53:06.156 --> 53:08.624
Chief of Police Rakov.

53:08.796 --> 53:11.185
Can I get paid now?

53:11.356 --> 53:12.584
Oh.

53:12.756 --> 53:14.348
It's in the mail.

53:15.036 --> 53:17.231
And so are you.

53:20.036 --> 53:22.596
Oh, no. Not again.

53:22.756 --> 53:24.394
So...

53:24.556 --> 53:28.185
- Did you get any of Lassard's team?
- No.

53:30.396 --> 53:32.830
But you did get Lassard, yes?

53:32.996 --> 53:34.588
No.

53:36.676 --> 53:39.110
You bumbling nincompoops!

53:39.276 --> 53:42.234
You call yourselves men?!

53:43.156 --> 53:46.831
There must be someone we can call.

53:48.796 --> 53:51.868
We haven't called the police.

54:26.716 --> 54:29.435
"To American police-ski:."

54:29.596 --> 54:31.746
Bolshoi Theatre, tonight.

54:31.916 --> 54:35.670
Konali to buy
stolen shipment of weapons.

54:35.836 --> 54:37.110
You must stop him.

54:37.276 --> 54:39.631
A friend...

54:40.756 --> 54:42.553
You know I don't speak Russian.

54:42.716 --> 54:44.991
But, sweetheart, it's a ballet.

54:45.156 --> 54:48.466
Hey, who wants some nuts?!
I got fresh nuts over here. Catch.

54:48.996 --> 54:52.352
There you go, mister.
No, it didn't reach you long enough.

54:52.516 --> 54:55.030
Up, topside!

54:55.516 --> 54:58.394
I gotcha! There you go, Mr. Benny!

54:58.636 --> 55:01.389
Sorry, lady.

55:03.676 --> 55:06.474
Who wants nuts? Right over here!

55:43.556 --> 55:47.071
Excuse me, babushka.
I'm sorry. Excuse me, ma'am.

55:47.236 --> 55:49.227
- Ticket, please.
- I don't have a ticket.

55:49.396 --> 55:52.468
- You need a ticket.
- I'm an American police captain...

55:52.636 --> 55:55.150
on assignment.
I don't need a ticket.

55:55.316 --> 55:58.308
- I'm sorry. You must have ticket.
- Don't you understand?

55:58.476 --> 56:00.387
I have to arrest somebody in there.

56:00.556 --> 56:02.865
You cannot arrest anyone
without a ticket.

56:03.036 --> 56:07.029
You think so?
Well, we'll just see about that.

56:07.196 --> 56:10.347
Excuse me. Make way. Make way.

56:54.956 --> 56:57.026
Must be a replacement.

56:59.236 --> 57:02.387
- Captain Harris! Get out of here.
- Tackleberry!

57:02.556 --> 57:04.148
- Now!
- What are you doing here?

57:04.316 --> 57:05.590
We've got to get off!

57:06.036 --> 57:07.708
Go!

57:11.996 --> 57:13.224
Oh!

57:13.436 --> 57:15.472
- Tackleberry! Konali!
- Over here.

57:15.636 --> 57:17.831
- Go away!
- We gotta get out of here!

57:17.996 --> 57:19.224
It's Konali!

57:21.836 --> 57:25.431
Come on, before he sees us! Come on!

57:32.036 --> 57:35.028
I saw Konali. Konali! I saw Konali!

57:35.196 --> 57:38.074
- That's Konali! Put me down!
- I know, sir! I know, sir!

57:38.236 --> 57:40.545
- Konali!
- I know!

57:42.316 --> 57:43.544
Freeze!

57:44.676 --> 57:45.904
You're under arrest.

57:46.076 --> 57:48.192
- What are you doing?
- Arresting you.

57:48.356 --> 57:50.870
His butt is mine! I'll arrest him!

57:51.036 --> 57:53.596
For selling weapons
to a known criminal.

57:57.756 --> 57:59.508
"Sunshine Kids. ."

58:03.196 --> 58:05.756
We've been set up.

58:08.796 --> 58:11.356
I am completely disgusted with you all.

58:11.516 --> 58:15.395
I am glad my good friend, Commandant
Lassard, knew nothing about this.

58:15.556 --> 58:18.195
You are a disgrace to your uniforms...

58:18.356 --> 58:21.985
and an embarrassment to me.

58:22.156 --> 58:24.386
Yuri, you know what to do. Do it.

58:38.396 --> 58:40.705
Ever since he return from Moscow...

58:40.876 --> 58:44.630
I have been trying
to capture Konali red-handed!

58:46.076 --> 58:51.992
And now you cowboys waltz in
and smash my work to pieces!

58:53.116 --> 58:57.268
So now,
if my police look at Konali wrong...

58:57.436 --> 59:00.155
Konali will scream harassment!

59:01.756 --> 59:03.508
Americans...

59:04.596 --> 59:08.305
you are hereby ordered
to leave Russia.

59:10.076 --> 59:12.271
You understand?

59:14.116 --> 59:15.754
Get out!

59:17.516 --> 59:19.234
By 3:00 tomorrow!

59:22.076 --> 59:24.067
Or else!

59:25.836 --> 59:27.110
And as for you...

59:49.916 --> 59:53.625
Sir? Wanna remind you
the plane leaves at 3:00.

59:53.796 --> 59:56.151
In the bathroom.

59:57.116 --> 59:58.913
Sir?

01:00:02.196 --> 01:00:05.268
Something about that sign disturbs me.

01:00:06.156 --> 01:00:07.555
Mama.

01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:11.388
- What do you say we...?
- I'm way ahead of you.

01:00:19.676 --> 01:00:21.189
Sir?

01:00:37.956 --> 01:00:42.871
The other bag. The other... Big bag-ski,
big bag. Here, give it to me.

01:00:43.356 --> 01:00:45.153
Jones! Get me up!

01:00:45.316 --> 01:00:48.149
I have never been humiliated
like this before!

01:00:48.316 --> 01:00:51.467
- So you've been humiliated other ways?
- Just shut up, Jones.

01:00:51.636 --> 01:00:53.274
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Connors!

01:00:53.436 --> 01:00:55.552
I thought you weren't coming.

01:00:57.756 --> 01:01:00.475
Didn't want my heart to be broken.
Now it's too late.

01:01:09.116 --> 01:01:10.708
Callahan! They got Callahan!

01:01:14.876 --> 01:01:16.628
- Who the hell?
- Callahan!

01:01:16.796 --> 01:01:19.230
- Connors!
- Let's go!

01:01:19.396 --> 01:01:22.593
Don't worry about me!
Take care of yourself!

01:01:23.076 --> 01:01:25.544
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:01:27.156 --> 01:01:28.987
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:01:29.156 --> 01:01:35.026
Come on! Move-ski, move-ski, move-ski!
Go! Go! Start it up! Go!

01:01:35.916 --> 01:01:39.192
Connors! Hang on, Connors!

01:01:41.956 --> 01:01:43.184
Shut up.

01:01:44.476 --> 01:01:47.149
Sergeant, can't you go any faster?
Make this thing go!

01:01:47.356 --> 01:01:51.190
- He's going to get killed!
- Nobody on my team gets killed...

01:01:51.356 --> 01:01:54.553
- And that's an order!
- I'm gonna get killed!

01:01:54.716 --> 01:01:56.069
Jeez!

01:01:58.276 --> 01:01:59.994
Shake him off!

01:02:08.996 --> 01:02:11.146
- Tackleberry, give me your gun.
- Yes, sir!

01:02:11.356 --> 01:02:15.668
This is a locator bullet. If we can hit the
car with it, we can follow it anywhere.

01:02:16.476 --> 01:02:17.704
Yes, sir!

01:02:17.876 --> 01:02:20.310
Sasha, just get me one clean shot.

01:02:20.476 --> 01:02:22.910
Fire it, Tack. Fire it, let's go!

01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:27.028
Tackleberry, do something right
for a change. Hit that car!

01:02:29.316 --> 01:02:30.544
Gotcha.

01:02:42.756 --> 01:02:44.633
- My buddy! Help!
- Russkies!

01:02:44.796 --> 01:02:46.832
Russkies, in the motorcycle!

01:02:53.116 --> 01:02:55.994
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:03:01.956 --> 01:03:04.595
Don't you understand English?
Faster!

01:03:06.316 --> 01:03:08.466
What is this, a rodeo? Come on!

01:03:16.396 --> 01:03:17.909
Get closer!

01:03:29.796 --> 01:03:31.309
Connors!

01:03:40.956 --> 01:03:44.790
Connors! You better be glad you
weren't killed, because I've got a plan.

01:03:44.956 --> 01:03:46.947
Hurry up. Move it, move it, move it!

01:03:48.756 --> 01:03:50.269
It works.

01:04:02.556 --> 01:04:07.186
Shamed. In front of my men!
My peers!

01:04:07.916 --> 01:04:11.033
- My mommy!
- Sorry about that.

01:04:19.396 --> 01:04:22.593
You. You will pay dearly
for what you have done!

01:04:25.156 --> 01:04:26.714
I know.

01:04:34.476 --> 01:04:38.469
You will marry me.

01:04:38.636 --> 01:04:41.594
- Nice getup.
- Thanks.

01:04:43.916 --> 01:04:48.990
- We're going to share everything.
- Okay.

01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:02.907
Right in bull's-eye!

01:05:06.316 --> 01:05:11.026
I cannot believe your obstinacy!
You could have had it all!

01:05:11.316 --> 01:05:14.433
Instead you betray me?
I am going to bury you!

01:05:16.636 --> 01:05:18.991
What? What? I'm busy!

01:05:19.156 --> 01:05:21.511
The game is in
the police station computer.

01:05:27.036 --> 01:05:29.152
I'm in! Yes!

01:05:29.316 --> 01:05:33.912
Now for the key. My secret code.
Turn around.

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:36.756
- Three, four, five.
- Yes.

01:05:36.996 --> 01:05:41.547
Everything ready at the warehouse?
Got to go, cupcake.

01:05:43.156 --> 01:05:45.716
I get in touch with you later.
See if you change your mind.

01:06:03.356 --> 01:06:05.631
Shoot him.

01:06:13.116 --> 01:06:15.186
Look, he left us play toy.

01:06:16.596 --> 01:06:18.507
I really need this.

01:06:18.716 --> 01:06:20.547
Tackleberry, crash the left window.

01:06:20.716 --> 01:06:23.184
Jones, Connors, Katrina,
the right window.

01:06:23.556 --> 01:06:26.354
I'll go through the roof with the guys.

01:06:27.116 --> 01:06:30.267
- How about the door?
- Well, move it, move it, move it.

01:06:31.156 --> 01:06:33.386
Take that, perverts!

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:36.832
This next room has to be it.
Crash through on the count of three.

01:06:36.996 --> 01:06:39.829
- One, two...
- Freeze!

01:06:39.996 --> 01:06:43.068
- Did anyone hear me say "three"?
- I took care of it.

01:06:43.676 --> 01:06:44.904
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

01:06:45.316 --> 01:06:47.784
Konali has left the building.

01:06:47.956 --> 01:06:50.789
Some command let him break into
the police computer system.

01:06:50.956 --> 01:06:54.505
- If he gets in, we can't stop him.
- His hacker was working on the game.

01:06:54.676 --> 01:06:57.315
- The key must be on it.
- They're sending a shipment.

01:06:57.476 --> 01:06:59.990
- They're at the warehouse.
- Let's go.

01:07:01.036 --> 01:07:05.109
Wait. Talinsky said if you're not
on the 3:00 flight he'll arrest you.

01:07:05.316 --> 01:07:08.433
She's right. Let's go anyway.

01:07:12.876 --> 01:07:15.834
- No problem.
- There, that's them! Go, go, go!

01:07:15.996 --> 01:07:18.032
- It's Talinsky.
- Okay, it's a problem.

01:07:47.916 --> 01:07:51.192
Good. Good.

01:07:51.356 --> 01:07:55.031
In 48 hours, "The New Game"
will be in stores worldwide.

01:08:04.796 --> 01:08:06.548
How we gonna park?

01:08:13.196 --> 01:08:14.914
Sasha!

01:08:22.555 --> 01:08:26.707
Let's go! Let's go!
Move it! Move it! Move it!

01:08:26.876 --> 01:08:30.073
All right, listen up! Listen up!
Jones, give me those handcuffs.

01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:33.751
- Now, remember: I will arrest Konali.
- Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:08:33.916 --> 01:08:37.113
Now, we attack on three.
One, two...

01:08:40.156 --> 01:08:41.908
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:08:47.236 --> 01:08:50.865
Advertising spots will run consecutive
days for the next three months.

01:08:51.036 --> 01:08:53.630
And A.M. Moscow wants you
for a guest spot.

01:08:55.116 --> 01:08:57.232
Keep car running!

01:08:57.395 --> 01:09:00.944
- Where is master disk and passkey?
- It's back inside your safe.

01:09:01.116 --> 01:09:03.232
In the restaurant office,
as you requested.

01:09:03.395 --> 01:09:05.148
Good.

01:09:05.316 --> 01:09:07.876
Hey, Natasha.

01:09:08.036 --> 01:09:11.665
- I'll let you know if I need anything else.
- You need a good attorney.

01:09:11.836 --> 01:09:15.033
Konstantine Konali, I arrest you
in the name of the law.

01:09:15.196 --> 01:09:16.948
Stop. Everybody stop.

01:09:17.116 --> 01:09:21.553
- Put up gun!
- I have arrested Konali. He's my prisoner.

01:09:21.756 --> 01:09:24.667
I will not be humiliated again
like Bolshoi disaster.

01:09:25.555 --> 01:09:27.466
I've seen this before.

01:09:27.636 --> 01:09:29.786
I was playing with this
in Rakov's office.

01:09:29.956 --> 01:09:33.107
My lawyer's going to sue
for malicious prosecution...

01:09:33.276 --> 01:09:37.064
intentional harassment
and breaking a guy's heart.

01:09:37.595 --> 01:09:41.111
You're not going to sue anybody,
because I am sending you to jail.

01:09:41.276 --> 01:09:45.234
- Do you have proof?
- Proof? Proof.

01:09:45.956 --> 01:09:48.265
- Do we have proof?
- Yes.

01:09:48.636 --> 01:09:51.469
Lieutenant, it's right under your nose.

01:09:54.196 --> 01:09:56.266
What's the number
of the police computer?

01:09:56.436 --> 01:09:57.755
2913855.

01:09:57.916 --> 01:10:00.510
- That's top security...
- Type in "Konali. ".

01:10:06.836 --> 01:10:09.714
- Come on, Connors. Keep trying.
- Try "Konstantine. ".

01:10:13.956 --> 01:10:16.311
- No.
- Wait. It was five letters.

01:10:16.476 --> 01:10:18.432
I saw Konali type five letters.

01:10:19.556 --> 01:10:20.830
"Greed. ."

01:10:22.196 --> 01:10:23.834
Type in "greed. ".

01:10:28.956 --> 01:10:30.548
Classified information!

01:10:30.716 --> 01:10:32.866
Konali hid a program
in his computer game.

01:10:33.036 --> 01:10:36.949
Nobody would know it was there.
It allowed him access to the user's files.

01:10:37.116 --> 01:10:39.027
It's like stealing candy from a baby.

01:10:39.196 --> 01:10:42.393
Or top-secret information
from a government.

01:10:43.316 --> 01:10:47.104
I finally got you, Konali. Ha!

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:49.910
Captain Harris?

01:10:51.916 --> 01:10:53.872
Oh, no.

01:10:59.316 --> 01:11:04.151
A toast to my new Russian family.

01:11:16.236 --> 01:11:20.149
Excuse me.
I have to go to the boys' room.

01:11:30.076 --> 01:11:31.714
Oh, excuse me.

01:11:31.876 --> 01:11:33.912
- I thought this was the bathroom.
- You!

01:11:34.996 --> 01:11:36.793
- Lassard.
- Why, yes.

01:11:36.956 --> 01:11:39.754
I'm flattered you recognize me.
I'm not sure where...

01:11:39.916 --> 01:11:42.032
- You can't have me!
- I don't want you.

01:11:43.836 --> 01:11:45.235
- En garde!
- On what?

01:12:02.876 --> 01:12:04.468
You have any last requests?

01:12:06.436 --> 01:12:08.950
God! God! Sonny Bono!

01:12:15.356 --> 01:12:16.675
Upsy-daisy!

01:12:20.396 --> 01:12:22.830
- You look familiar.
- Don't play with me, Lassard.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:25.587
- Was it Paris?
- No, not Paris.

01:12:25.756 --> 01:12:27.872
- Rome?
- Not Rome.

01:12:28.036 --> 01:12:30.391
You think you can play me the fool?

01:12:31.396 --> 01:12:32.795
Olé!

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.672
You'll never take me, Lassard!

01:12:37.276 --> 01:12:40.473
Not Konstantine Konali!

01:12:42.196 --> 01:12:45.632
I remember you now.

01:12:49.796 --> 01:12:53.755
You're under arrest
for crimes against Russia...

01:12:53.916 --> 01:12:57.909
and America and their citizens!
Ha!

01:13:08.156 --> 01:13:09.714
Do it!

01:13:15.196 --> 01:13:17.312
- Today...
- Today, today.

01:13:18.596 --> 01:13:21.064
- We have shown...
- We have shown, we have shown.

01:13:25.716 --> 01:13:29.231
- People everywhere...
- People everywhere...

01:13:31.516 --> 01:13:35.225
that Americans and Russians
are brothers.

01:13:38.916 --> 01:13:41.066
I honor you and your team.

01:13:41.236 --> 01:13:44.785
Would Commandant Lassard
please join me at podium?

01:14:00.316 --> 01:14:01.908
Comrade.

01:14:02.076 --> 01:14:07.628
And now, as a special tribute
to our American friends...

01:14:07.796 --> 01:14:10.230
I salute you all.
