WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:06.212
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.381 --> 00:09.089
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.218 --> 00:12.211
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.304 --> 00:15.047
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.390 --> 00:17.302
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.392 --> 00:20.180
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.270 --> 00:23.263
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:26.100
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:26.193 --> 00:28.401
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.571 --> 00:31.187
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.281 --> 00:34.365
He only wants the bus metas,
he wants their powers, all of them.

00:34.535 --> 00:35.696
DeVoe has absorbed the powers

00:35.786 --> 00:38.950
of Kilg%re, Hazard, Black Bison,
Brainstorm and Dwarfstar.

00:40.040 --> 00:42.202
- I'm gonna take DeVoe down.
- Just like Izzy would have wanted.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.750
DeVoe orchestrated everything to get
the people he wanted on the bus.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.919
We've got a planner, just like Thawne.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.962
This is an intelligence booster.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.915
I'll finally be able
to outthink The Thinker.

00:54.930 --> 00:56.637
- Daddy?
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.430
The last two remaining bus metas.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.267
Janet Petty and Edwin Gauss.

01:03.230 --> 01:04.311
<i>- Ralph.
- Ready.</i>

01:04.397 --> 01:07.687
<i>Connect double Scarlet Speedster
in three, two, one.</i>

01:07.776 --> 01:09.517
<i>Wait. I got a better idea.</i>

01:11.196 --> 01:12.607
Over here, Doc Ock.

01:13.824 --> 01:15.531
Watch this, Master Splinter.

01:17.369 --> 01:18.701
Turtle power.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.955
Shut it down.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.291
All right, let's run
it again. We gotta make this work.

01:33.677 --> 01:34.918
Does he know that?

01:36.555 --> 01:37.762
Ralph?

01:39.141 --> 01:40.177
Ralph?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.142
What?

01:43.228 --> 01:45.686
One more time, please.
Follow Barry's plan.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.230
You know, the one where I've spent
hours of my precious time

01:48.317 --> 01:50.024
programming realistic holograms for you?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.439
Which, bravo on that, by the way.

01:52.696 --> 01:54.312
- Thank you.
- Look, just...

01:54.406 --> 01:56.398
Morph yourself into Barry,
there'll be two Flashes,

01:56.491 --> 01:59.325
Thinker won't know which
one is which, and we'll confuse him.

01:59.411 --> 02:00.652
Kind of a "her," actually.

02:00.746 --> 02:02.487
Ralph, you're missing
the point of this exercise.

02:02.581 --> 02:04.664
No, I get it.
I was just doing a little improv.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.241
But this
isn't stand-up comedy!

02:06.335 --> 02:08.201
Yeah, I know that,
but you just let it play out,

02:08.294 --> 02:10.708
it would've worked, you could've
done some improv-ing of your own.

02:10.797 --> 02:12.629
Comedy comes in threes, man.

02:13.216 --> 02:14.752
We're trying to protect you.

02:14.926 --> 02:16.258
DeVoe's coming.

02:16.345 --> 02:18.211
We need to be ready, all of us.

02:18.430 --> 02:19.466
Okay?

02:19.556 --> 02:21.047
I still think it's a pretty good plan.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.303
I hide my face, I save my ass.

02:33.070 --> 02:35.687
We'd make a fortune.
An improv group made up of superheroes?

02:35.781 --> 02:36.897
We can take it to Washington.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.027
- We'd be the DC Comics.
- No, Ralph.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.653
First rule of improv is say yes.

02:40.744 --> 02:42.406
Would it kill you to take
training seriously?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.738
Would it kill you to open up
your mind grapes just a little?

02:45.749 --> 02:47.786
Hey, we'll get there.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.992
Eventually, but we'll get there.

02:49.086 --> 02:50.952
He's just making a big joke
out of the whole thing.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.753
It's just the way he is, Barry.

02:52.839 --> 02:56.298
I know, but he needs to think
like a hero, stay on point.

02:56.385 --> 02:59.719
DeVoe's thought of everything.
We can't just wing this one.

02:59.805 --> 03:02.422
Look, we'll figure it out.
We always do, right?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.506
Melting Point's on our team now,

03:03.600 --> 03:04.761
we just need to find
the other two bus metas.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.218
And we'll be in good shape.

03:07.771 --> 03:08.761
Yeah.

03:11.692 --> 03:14.150
Where are we with tracking down
Edwin Gauss and Janet Petty?

03:14.236 --> 03:16.979
- No, no. He's... He's still...
- What?

03:18.240 --> 03:19.230
Working on it.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.486
I can't work with all this noise!

03:21.576 --> 03:24.364
That is disgusting, Harry,
really, grow up.

03:24.579 --> 03:25.569
Really?

03:25.747 --> 03:26.908
Wasn't me.

03:28.792 --> 03:29.873
That was expensive.

03:30.794 --> 03:33.912
Harry, look, every time
you try to locate these guys,

03:34.005 --> 03:34.995
it's the same thing.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.626
I'm telling you,
you just crack that thing open,

03:36.717 --> 03:38.504
- it's probably broken.
- It's not broken.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.427
It's just finding these two
is complicated.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.179
Why is that?

03:43.265 --> 03:47.100
Because this dude, Edwin Gauss,
flat out disappeared the day

03:47.185 --> 03:49.017
Allen came out of the speed force.
No credit card charges,

03:49.104 --> 03:51.346
no bank withdrawals,
no social media posts, nothing.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.102
- Gone.
- What about Janet Petty?

03:53.567 --> 03:56.310
Just as tricky. I asked Joe
to pull her file from C.C.P.D.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.814
Her first known record wasn't
until she was 13.

03:57.904 --> 04:01.488
Some sort of a nomad.
Last known address, Iron Heights.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.237
- What's she in for?
- Trifecta, breaking and entering,

04:03.326 --> 04:04.783
trespassing, and burglary.

04:04.870 --> 04:07.078
What we should be worried about is,
where is she now?

04:07.164 --> 04:08.746
And what are her powers?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.078
Is that really her handle?

04:12.377 --> 04:13.367
<i>"Null"?</i>

04:13.462 --> 04:15.875
Okay, DeVoe needs both of these
people for whatever he has planned,

04:15.964 --> 04:17.375
so we have to figure out where they are.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.300
I will, Allen, if I can get
a little peace, a little quiet,

04:20.385 --> 04:21.546
and no interruptions!

04:24.347 --> 04:25.337
Great.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.011
- Cisky.
- Breacher?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.178
I need your help.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.389
Little bit
of a mixed message here.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.725
I was hunting Lord Crucifer,

04:37.736 --> 04:39.227
leader of the Tenth Circle.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.654
His cult of bloodsuckers ambushed me.

04:41.740 --> 04:44.904
- They had me surrounded.
- So, you were attacked by...

04:46.119 --> 04:47.109
Vampires?

04:47.204 --> 04:48.365
Hundreds of vampires.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.914
The battle was fierce,
but I managed to dismantle

04:52.000 --> 04:53.491
his entire force.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.494
But when I went to finish off Crucifer,

04:56.588 --> 04:57.578
something happened to me.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.379
My powers, they were gone.

05:02.469 --> 05:03.550
What do you mean?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.173
I couldn't vibe blast.

05:05.430 --> 05:06.591
Crucifer got away.

05:06.681 --> 05:08.764
He must've done something to my powers!

05:08.850 --> 05:10.591
Has this ever happened before?

05:10.685 --> 05:11.971
Never.

05:14.105 --> 05:17.849
But Cynthia always said
you were an intelligent man.

05:18.401 --> 05:20.859
Well versed in the meta-science.

05:20.946 --> 05:23.939
Glad to hear Gypsy
still remembers who I am.

05:24.407 --> 05:26.364
Hey, you're her boss.
You would know the answer to this.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.238
Does she ever get a day off?

05:28.328 --> 05:30.911
Cynthia is very devoted to her job.

05:31.706 --> 05:33.117
But in regards to your skills...

05:33.208 --> 05:35.074
Yeah, yeah, let me guess.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.160
- You think she's wrong.
- No!

05:41.049 --> 05:43.416
What I wanna say is,
I think you can fix me.

05:45.554 --> 05:46.544
Oh.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.423
Well...

05:50.517 --> 05:51.724
Sir...

05:51.977 --> 05:56.642
We would be happy to run some tests
in the speed lab, you know,

05:56.731 --> 05:58.188
see if everything's okay.

05:58.275 --> 05:59.356
Thank you, Cisco.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.192
Now, I must get some tea.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.651
- He didn't insult me once.
- Nope.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.035
I just hope we can help him.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.119
How was your rest, my love?

06:20.463 --> 06:23.171
Wonderful, I've never felt more
rejuvenated and ready

06:23.258 --> 06:24.965
to realize our dream.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.087
Clifford.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.637
The additional dark matter
from our subject metas,

06:30.724 --> 06:33.717
is overwhelming this host's body.

06:34.477 --> 06:35.763
How long do we have?

06:35.854 --> 06:37.220
At the present rate...

06:38.481 --> 06:39.847
Just over a week's time.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.649
No, I will not allow it.

06:43.236 --> 06:45.569
It may be possible to adjust
the biomass index,

06:45.655 --> 06:49.740
re-calibrate the energy distribution,
extend your current host's life.

06:51.953 --> 06:53.114
Odd.

06:53.371 --> 06:57.365
There are already plans for such
an adjustment partially designed.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.000
I attempted the same course of action.

07:00.587 --> 07:04.581
Though my mind for engineering
is nowhere near as gifted as yours.

07:05.550 --> 07:06.836
Well, you got a good start.

07:07.761 --> 07:11.129
I will be able to complete
these designs within a few hours.

07:12.182 --> 07:15.300
Rest, my love. I will handle everything.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.636
You always do.

07:19.147 --> 07:22.106
And then we will continue on our search

07:22.192 --> 07:25.356
for the remaining two bus metas.

07:26.905 --> 07:30.148
You mean, three.
The Weeper is still at large.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.609
Yes.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.196
Three.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.949
Perhaps my mind is being
affected as well.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.048
Come on, put your back into it.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.848
Put your fat back into it.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.058
This stinks, man.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.853
This is too heavy and you're too weak.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.643
Let's get the big dolly.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.893
Dude, the crate's gone.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.475
We gotta call the boss.

09:04.085 --> 09:07.203
Well, well, well, well, well.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.377
If the crown fits...

09:14.804 --> 09:16.636
We're moving, I was telling the guy,

09:16.723 --> 09:18.931
"It's gonna take all night
to move this stuff."

09:19.017 --> 09:21.259
Okay, remember.
Let's just be discreet.

09:21.352 --> 09:22.968
Neither one of us
are supposed to be here.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.599
- Can you do that?
- Can pigs fly?

09:25.106 --> 09:27.439
- No.
- They can if you put 'em on an airplane.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.857
Think, Allen, think.

09:28.943 --> 09:29.979
Okay.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.528
Just here with your chai latte,
Detective West.

09:32.989 --> 09:33.979
Subtle.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.690
- It was gone.
- Excuse me, just a second, okay?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.114
Hey.

09:39.204 --> 09:40.240
What happened?

09:40.330 --> 09:41.571
Robbery.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.031
Stole the Kahndaq dynasty family crown.

09:44.125 --> 09:46.287
It was brought here
for the museum exhibition.

09:46.503 --> 09:49.211
The security guard said that
it was being transported

09:49.297 --> 09:52.131
in a steel-plated crate,
weighs about 200 pounds.

09:52.509 --> 09:54.546
Suddenly disappeared without a trace,

09:54.844 --> 09:56.961
and then reappeared completely smashed.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.217
So was anything else
missing in the museum?

09:59.307 --> 10:00.923
Just the crown, nothing else is missing.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.929
Should I stretch around the perimeter,
check things out?

10:03.019 --> 10:05.887
No, not yet. I can tell from here
to cause that type of impact,

10:05.980 --> 10:08.188
case had to be moving at
at least 55 miles per hour.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.436
So we're looking for a meta
with super strength?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.897
Maybe. Are there fingerprints
on the case?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.603
I'll have them dust it,
send the results in.

10:14.697 --> 10:17.280
Why wait? I can just grab the tape,
get the prints right now.

10:17.367 --> 10:18.357
No, no. Hey!

10:18.451 --> 10:20.784
It was definitely Killer Frost,
and she looked at me.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.156
Ralph!

10:25.708 --> 10:26.869
Dude!

10:27.585 --> 10:29.042
I need this job!

10:29.129 --> 10:31.337
Allen, look what you did.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.793
That's you, bro.

10:42.559 --> 10:44.972
Die, Plastoid, die!

10:46.980 --> 10:48.016
Again.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.066
All right.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.816
I think that's enough.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.361
All right. Hey, look, Breacher,
I know you're clearly very...

11:04.622 --> 11:06.784
Frustrated, uh,

11:07.375 --> 11:08.991
but don't stress, okay?

11:09.252 --> 11:10.834
We're gonna figure this out,
and once we do,

11:11.296 --> 11:12.787
we're gonna fix it, I promise.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.133
Cisky, look.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.552
I'm sorry for the way I've treated you.

11:20.972 --> 11:22.258
But when you fix me,

11:22.557 --> 11:26.392
I'll give Cynthia more time
to be with you.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.343
Really?

11:28.563 --> 11:29.644
Yeah.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.231
Now, I'm hungry.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.726
We can fix that, too.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.146
Um, there's donuts
in the downstairs break room.

11:38.239 --> 11:39.525
Help yourself, it's a huge selection.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.533
Yeah. Try the pineapple fritters.

11:44.162 --> 11:46.654
And don't forget to try
the nacho donuts.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.114
Those are really good.

11:52.045 --> 11:55.334
Looks like things are looking up
for your boy, Cisco.

11:55.423 --> 11:56.664
Yeah?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.336
What? What?

11:58.426 --> 11:59.837
What is... What? What is it?
What is wrong with him?

11:59.928 --> 12:02.295
Nothing, really.
He seems to be in good health.

12:02.388 --> 12:03.924
There's nothing abnormal
in his blood work

12:04.015 --> 12:06.382
and his body scan showed
no signs of cellular damage,

12:06.476 --> 12:09.014
despite years of using
vibrational powers.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.594
Okay. So, then, why the face?

12:10.688 --> 12:13.647
Because Crucifer didn't take
his powers from him.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.690
Father Time did.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.352
He can't blast
because he's getting older?

12:18.446 --> 12:21.314
Mmm-hmm. Powers like yours requires
a lot of energy,

12:21.407 --> 12:23.444
and when that energy
starts to dwindle...

12:23.534 --> 12:26.493
Vibe blasts are the first things to go?

12:26.579 --> 12:27.990
I think you have to tell him.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.657
He's never ever gonna let me
see Gypsy if I tell him.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.826
He's probably gonna send a knife

12:33.920 --> 12:36.378
flying right through my skull
if I tell him.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.171
He might...

12:38.716 --> 12:40.332
But it's the right thing to do.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.610
What the...

13:15.253 --> 13:17.119
Initiate chemical analysis.

13:26.389 --> 13:28.597
A $40,000 vase?

13:28.975 --> 13:30.261
It's not like it was made of gold.

13:30.560 --> 13:33.678
Actually, it was, and you two
can't go to crime scenes anymore,

13:33.771 --> 13:35.307
- PIs or not.
- Don't give me that look.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.640
I was just trying to speed up
the process of finding this meta, Allen.

13:37.734 --> 13:38.975
Which is taking forever.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.229
Wait, we got a hit.

13:40.611 --> 13:43.820
Jeannie Williams.
Um, oh, wait, we got multiple hits.

13:44.073 --> 13:47.942
Jane Liska, Judy Newton...
She's used like 17 different aliases.

13:48.703 --> 13:49.910
Okay, so how do we find her?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.950
And we can't just wait for her
to rob somebody else.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.622
Well, we don't have to.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.952
We have the many variations
of her facade.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.504
All right? We simply plug these
many variations into

14:00.590 --> 14:02.252
- the facial recognition software.
- See if we get a hit.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.423
Exactly right.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.337
You're starting
to come in handy, Harry.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.462
That's 40 minutes ago.

14:08.556 --> 14:09.922
Corner of Orchard and Broome.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.594
Orchard and Broome? What's over there?

14:11.684 --> 14:12.970
Not "what."

14:13.061 --> 14:14.268
Who.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.679
- Come on. Come on.
- What are you...

14:22.278 --> 14:24.110
It smells like liverwurst.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.150
Yeah, wait till we get inside.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.649
Open up.

14:28.743 --> 14:30.359
Okay, stick to the plan.
We question her.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.819
We find Null, we cuff her.

14:31.913 --> 14:34.326
Got it. Little good cop/bad cop action.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.785
Who the hell are you?

14:41.089 --> 14:42.625
Your worst nightmare.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.790
Uh, Joe? What are you
doing?

14:47.804 --> 14:49.545
Detective Joe West, C.C.P.D.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.179
We got a couple of questions
for you, scumbag.

14:51.265 --> 14:54.884
Hey, only my closest friends
can call me that.

14:56.104 --> 14:58.812
Word is, there's a new cutpurse in town

14:58.898 --> 15:02.858
who likes fancy jewels,
last seen in this part of town.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.770
- PI Barry Allen.
- PI Barry Allen...

15:05.863 --> 15:06.944
Show him, show him.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.280
Oh, Barry Allen, I know all about
your spectacular fall from grace.

15:11.494 --> 15:13.907
- Tragic, really.
- Yes, thank you. Just take a look.

15:16.666 --> 15:19.704
We're guessing she came here
for help to wash the sparklies.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.205
Oh, I should be so lucky.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.957
Certainly wouldn't mind a drop-in

15:23.047 --> 15:25.881
from a lovely-looking lassie like this.
You know what I mean?

15:25.967 --> 15:29.381
But unfortunately, not in my cards.
I'm sorry, can I keep this?

15:29.887 --> 15:32.846
I will mess you up for lying in my face.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.139
- Ralph.
- "Ralph"?

15:34.225 --> 15:35.966
- There's no Ralph here.
- Joe.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.676
I'm Detective Joe West,

15:37.770 --> 15:41.605
the baddest damn cop
you've ever come across.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.899
As God as my witness, I am not lying.

15:43.985 --> 15:45.226
I'm not.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.357
Oopsy-daisy.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.359
I knew it.

15:50.783 --> 15:53.526
- Joe West doesn't make any mistakes.
- Okay.

15:54.162 --> 15:55.619
Where'd she go, Earl?

16:01.210 --> 16:02.451
Deal's off.

16:02.920 --> 16:04.081
Damn it.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.747
Cuffs.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.458
- Cuffs.
- Allen.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.863
Babe, you okay?

16:32.200 --> 16:34.408
I just wanna get down from here
as soon as possible.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.827
Maybe you should try to burp
yourself down like Charlie Bucket.

16:36.913 --> 16:37.994
Ralph.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.823
- Anything?
- Well, as best I can tell,

16:40.917 --> 16:42.954
Null's powers affect
the density of his cells.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.330
It's like
you've been filled with helium.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.537
- Terrific.
- Always knew you were a lightweight.

16:46.631 --> 16:47.792
I swear, Ralph...

16:47.882 --> 16:50.795
Hey, is there a way
to reengage his gravitational...

16:50.885 --> 16:52.342
Gravitational force.

16:52.428 --> 16:54.886
Huh. Turns out...

16:55.723 --> 16:56.759
Not necessary.

16:56.849 --> 16:57.885
Do not let go.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.932
Based on Barry's standard mass
and gravitational force G

17:00.019 --> 17:01.009
and taking into account

17:01.103 --> 17:03.846
the half-life decrement
of Null's dark matter infusion,

17:03.940 --> 17:07.308
this effect should eventually
just wear off.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.236
- "Wear off"?
- Your cells should return to normal

17:11.321 --> 17:12.858
- right about...
- What the hell?

17:15.952 --> 17:16.942
Now.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.403
Two for the landing,
but perfect 10 for the "thud" noise.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.238
Why are you joking right now?

17:22.541 --> 17:24.078
I mean, seriously, what the hell
was that back there,

17:24.167 --> 17:25.249
pretending to be Joe?

17:25.670 --> 17:27.377
I committed to the bit,
I couldn't blow my cover.

17:27.463 --> 17:29.500
Ralph, what if that had
happened outside on the street?

17:29.590 --> 17:31.252
I could've floated away
into the stratosphere,

17:31.342 --> 17:33.174
- fallen to my death.
- I would've figured something out.

17:33.261 --> 17:34.251
Ral...

17:34.470 --> 17:37.588
Out of the 12 bus metas we've found,
DeVoe is in control of seven of them.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.093
If he gets Null, it'll be eight.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.095
If he gets control of her powers...

17:41.602 --> 17:43.719
We're talking about your life here.

17:46.691 --> 17:48.307
Sorry, I was just thinking about
the end of <i>Lost.</i>

17:49.110 --> 17:51.818
I mean, were they in purgatory?
What did Kate really see in Jack?

17:51.904 --> 17:53.145
Ralph...

17:55.241 --> 17:57.278
I'm sorry, man, but I'm benching you.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.485
- Why?
- Because you're constantly

17:59.579 --> 18:02.037
in the middle of a comedy routine
instead of doing what you should.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.204
If you had just tossed me the cuffs,

18:03.291 --> 18:04.702
we would have Null right now.

18:04.792 --> 18:05.999
Yeah, or she could have ran out the door

18:06.085 --> 18:07.826
and I'd stretched the cuffs
on her when she didn't see it coming.

18:07.920 --> 18:10.003
It's fine.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.459
Look, I'm doing what's best for you.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.590
No, you're not.

18:14.677 --> 18:16.134
You're doing what's best for you.

18:23.269 --> 18:27.229
Display complete physiological
results for "DeVoe, Marlize."

18:29.984 --> 18:31.520
Cortisol levels low.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.604
Recent display of tachycardia.

18:35.698 --> 18:37.155
Repetitive pupil dilation.

18:40.453 --> 18:41.819
Display serotonin level.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.537
319 nanograms.

18:46.042 --> 18:50.878
Levels found in patients
using psychoactive narcotics.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.420
How is that?

18:58.095 --> 18:59.631
Subject four still at large.

19:05.811 --> 19:08.224
"Created to provide
widespread euphoria...

19:11.442 --> 19:13.024
"Or feelings of love."

19:23.663 --> 19:27.532
What if we put him
on an all-alkaline diet,

19:27.833 --> 19:29.950
full of antioxidants?

19:31.045 --> 19:35.039
- Nope.
- Okay, what if we...

19:35.132 --> 19:39.752
Oh, what if we make a super-shake
full of, like, enzymes and probiotics?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.425
Neither of those
are gonna work long-term, Cisco.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.174
Okay, well, we gotta come up
with something, right?

19:45.559 --> 19:47.846
I mean, how old is this guy, anyway?

19:51.107 --> 19:52.188
This guy's old.

19:52.942 --> 19:54.524
We have to solve this.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.861
'Cause I don't know about you,
but I actually like my life.

19:59.115 --> 20:01.107
I know this isn't the easy answer.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.987
But I think you have to tell him.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.443
Cisky!

20:05.913 --> 20:09.281
Oh, hey, you, we were
just talking about you.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.583
I've tasted all your donuts.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.376
Where is my cure?

20:13.504 --> 20:14.870
Well, it's a little, um...

20:15.798 --> 20:18.006
It's a little complicated.

20:18.300 --> 20:22.340
But, you are lucky,
my friend, because...

20:22.805 --> 20:26.924
Your fix is as simple
as taking one of these

20:27.017 --> 20:29.054
- little pink pills.
- Blue.

20:29.186 --> 20:30.176
Blue pills.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.261
Right there.

20:32.940 --> 20:35.182
"Antihistamine."

20:35.276 --> 20:37.689
That... That's right, antihistamine.

20:37.778 --> 20:42.239
See, uh, "stamine,"
that's Latin for "stamina,"

20:42.366 --> 20:44.574
which you have plenty of, you know.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.902
You have so much of it
that it's actually hurting you.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.739
But this antimatter pill,
it's gonna level you right out.

20:49.874 --> 20:50.910
Oh, you're taking it now.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.533
He's taking it now.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.719
Why is my vibe blast different?

21:05.723 --> 21:08.431
I think it's a side effect of the pills.

21:09.560 --> 21:11.051
Hasn't been thoroughly researched yet.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.886
But, you know, headaches, nausea,

21:14.148 --> 21:15.935
different, uh, colored vibes.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.017
I'm cured. Thank you.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.227
Anytime.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.192
You do realize
you're just making this worse?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.206
Nothing on Null so far.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.250
Harry's gonna try something else.

21:36.629 --> 21:37.961
- We'll find her.
- We have to.

21:38.422 --> 21:41.256
Even if Ralph does everything
in his power to screw it up.

21:41.801 --> 21:42.882
Barry.

21:43.302 --> 21:45.794
- That is not his intention.
- Well, he could've fooled me.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.262
It's his life. I mean,
if there's anything he cares about,

21:48.349 --> 21:50.011
- it's losing it.
- Well, he's gonna lose it

21:50.100 --> 21:51.807
if he doesn't start thinking like me,
like I taught him.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.053
Thinking like you?

21:54.146 --> 21:55.432
No.

21:56.106 --> 21:58.814
He's never gonna do that, Barry,
and you can't expect him to.

22:00.361 --> 22:01.897
Oh, boy.

22:03.697 --> 22:05.404
Robbery at Central City Jewelry.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.653
- Man, she loves bling.
- I'm on it.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.904
Wait, you need backup.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.485
Well, Ralph's too much
of a liability right now,

22:10.663 --> 22:11.653
he stays benched.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.204
- Caitlin, Cisco?
- They're with Breacher,

22:13.290 --> 22:14.531
it would take too long to wait for them.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.412
- Then what's the plan?
- The plan

22:17.169 --> 22:18.535
is oculation.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.295
You said her fingertips,

22:20.381 --> 22:21.917
they illuminated when she used
her powers,

22:22.007 --> 22:24.966
that means dark matter accelerant,
that means powers are generating

22:25.052 --> 22:28.136
from the optic nerve...
What I'm trying to say is...

22:28.848 --> 22:31.511
Null can't gravitate
what she cannot see.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.059
So you vibrate beyond the speed
of sight as you approach her eyeline.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.477
I'll be invisible to her.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.230
- It worked against DeVoe.
- That's right.

22:55.583 --> 22:56.619
Didn't see that coming.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.333
That's kind of the point.

22:58.627 --> 23:02.120
No, you didn't see that coming.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.544
See, I call it my "getaway car."

23:09.054 --> 23:11.046
'Cause either the person in there dies,

23:11.557 --> 23:12.968
or you let me get away.

23:37.291 --> 23:38.577
You okay?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.078
It's okay, just stay here.

23:53.974 --> 23:57.058
This useless piece
of trash is... Useless.

23:57.144 --> 23:59.978
It's like... I'm so dumb, I can't even
come up with a good synonym

24:00.064 --> 24:01.976
- for this useless piece of trash.
- Harry.

24:02.566 --> 24:04.808
No one could've predicted that
Null would have picked herself

24:04.902 --> 24:06.143
out of the cuffs or taken a hostage.

24:06.236 --> 24:08.853
Nor did either of you predict
the location of a 120-pound woman

24:08.948 --> 24:10.314
using the curvature of space-time

24:10.407 --> 24:12.069
caused by the uneven
distribution of mass,

24:12.159 --> 24:13.275
yet still somehow

24:13.577 --> 24:15.614
failed to account for
the gravitational pull

24:15.704 --> 24:20.745
of a 4,000-pound car
floating right above her head.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.371
Scientists have spent decades

24:22.461 --> 24:24.623
trying to understand relativity
and quantum gravity...

24:24.838 --> 24:26.124
This is not about
understanding gravity, Allen,

24:26.215 --> 24:28.878
it's about understanding her,
or not understanding her.

24:28.968 --> 24:32.006
As it turns out, DeVoe can somehow
calculate human behavior.

24:32.429 --> 24:34.762
Harry, stop. Look, I'm the one
that let her get away.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.965
- You did your best.
- Did I, Allen, really?

24:37.059 --> 24:39.642
This is the second meta
to evade the dampening cuffs.

24:40.688 --> 24:41.804
It's been almost a year.

24:41.897 --> 24:43.104
And where are we?

24:43.774 --> 24:45.231
And where is DeVoe?

24:49.905 --> 24:51.066
What?

24:52.992 --> 24:54.449
Nothing, it's just...

24:55.160 --> 24:57.447
You went out into the field
and you had a plan and...

24:57.955 --> 24:58.991
It didn't work.

24:59.373 --> 25:01.330
But they do for DeVoe.
Harry's not wrong.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.662
DeVoe's gone over every possible outcome

25:03.752 --> 25:04.959
before making his plans.

25:05.045 --> 25:07.628
Which we can't do,
and neither can Harry.

25:07.715 --> 25:09.172
Well, then, what are we supposed to do?

25:09.258 --> 25:11.671
I mean, you want us to just
ad-lib like Ralph wants us to?

25:11.760 --> 25:14.503
Barry, you didn't see it,
but when you were gone,

25:15.389 --> 25:16.721
Ralph rose to the occasion.

25:16.807 --> 25:18.799
He cracked jokes,
he thought outside the box.

25:18.892 --> 25:21.475
I mean, he got the job done
in the way that he knows how.

25:21.895 --> 25:25.980
So, the question is,
are you upset with Ralph

25:26.066 --> 25:27.807
because you think he's screwing around,

25:27.901 --> 25:29.813
or because he's not following your plan?

25:32.281 --> 25:33.442
Breacher.

25:33.991 --> 25:35.482
I thought maybe we could have a drink.

25:35.576 --> 25:38.068
I don't know, you strike me
as kind of a tequila guy, so...

25:40.456 --> 25:42.118
Oh, crap.

25:46.670 --> 25:49.162
You've come back
to die, Breacher.

25:51.008 --> 25:54.797
Time has come, Crucifer.
Die, vampire, die.

25:57.514 --> 25:59.005
Frak me, he's gonna die.

26:00.225 --> 26:02.763
Die!

26:08.484 --> 26:09.520
Wait a second.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.937
Hey, back up, <i>viejo.</i>

26:14.156 --> 26:15.488
Yo, <i>Dusk Till Dawn.</i>

26:15.574 --> 26:17.190
I think it's time you saw some sun.

26:19.036 --> 26:21.995
Idiot, sunlight doesn't hurt
this type of vampire.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.534
What?

26:25.000 --> 26:26.161
Time to go.

26:32.007 --> 26:36.297
You said your antimatter
histamine would cure me.

26:36.512 --> 26:39.596
Uh, yeah, I did say that, didn't I?

26:40.182 --> 26:43.391
You lied to me.
You said you could fix me.

26:43.602 --> 26:44.843
Now...

26:44.937 --> 26:46.178
I'll fix you.

26:49.316 --> 26:50.602
Breacher, stop.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.900
Your vibe blasts don't work.

26:56.782 --> 26:58.444
And they're not gonna work.

26:59.660 --> 27:00.741
Why not?

27:02.121 --> 27:03.487
Because of your age.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.789
I should've told you earlier.

27:07.209 --> 27:10.077
It's just I know
how special our powers are,

27:10.170 --> 27:13.254
and you were so happy
at the thought of having them back.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.922
And I miss your daughter.

27:15.717 --> 27:17.299
I just wanted to see her again.

27:18.720 --> 27:19.836
I'm sorry, Josh.

27:24.893 --> 27:26.509
I hate you.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.943
You did the right thing.

27:39.116 --> 27:40.323
Yeah.

27:43.078 --> 27:44.194
Thanks.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.242
Just wish he knew that.

27:49.918 --> 27:51.625
Clifford is lying to you.

27:53.714 --> 27:56.252
He is drugging you with sedative tears

27:56.341 --> 27:57.957
to keep you idle.

27:59.720 --> 28:00.881
Please.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.471
Please, remember.

28:05.434 --> 28:06.470
Escape.

28:12.900 --> 28:13.981
New lemonade recipe...

28:17.696 --> 28:18.903
It already exists.

28:23.952 --> 28:29.323
<i>Please, don't forget, he's lying to you.</i>

28:30.334 --> 28:31.916
<i>He's drugging you.</i>

28:33.378 --> 28:34.664
<i>He's a monster.</i>

28:34.755 --> 28:36.087
<i>You must escape.</i>

28:37.007 --> 28:38.873
You always save it
under the same name.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.549
<i>Escape now.</i>

28:40.636 --> 28:44.050
Every time you discover it.
It's quite clever, really.

28:45.098 --> 28:47.215
I would expect nothing less from you.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.811
How many times have I been through this?

28:52.439 --> 28:53.429
Too many.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.186
But that is of no concern.

28:57.236 --> 29:01.071
Because with tears from the Weeper
mixed with Dominic Lanse's powers,

29:02.658 --> 29:04.240
I can alter your memory.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.905
So that's why you created the Weeper.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.404
You didn't need a potential host, he...

29:09.498 --> 29:10.534
Worked for you, yes.

29:10.916 --> 29:14.125
I knew that the same thing
in you that I fell in love with

29:14.211 --> 29:16.043
had the potential to destroy us.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.708
Your humanity.

29:19.967 --> 29:23.836
I couldn't let that get
in the way of us achieving our goal.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.803
The enlightenment.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.425
Clifford, I am your wife.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.062
And I love you.

29:43.073 --> 29:46.237
But you are nothing without me.

30:05.846 --> 30:08.133
This is an interesting place
to hang out.

30:09.975 --> 30:12.137
You come here to suck
the fun out of being benched?

30:12.477 --> 30:13.558
I...

30:14.229 --> 30:16.016
No, I came for your help, actually.

30:16.982 --> 30:20.066
You want help from the guy
who can't take anything seriously?

30:20.152 --> 30:21.688
Look, I'm sorry.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.149
I shouldn't have been
so quick to judge, uh...

30:25.907 --> 30:27.318
But with DeVoe

30:28.660 --> 30:30.777
so many steps ahead of us,

30:31.204 --> 30:33.366
just to see you joking around
in the middle of this,

30:33.457 --> 30:36.074
it just made me feel like
you weren't taking it seriously.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.496
I know this is serious.

30:42.549 --> 30:46.259
I watched...
I watched Izzy die in front of me.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.930
I'm scared out of my mind.

30:51.933 --> 30:54.721
Well, you know,
you got an odd way of showing it.

30:54.811 --> 30:57.724
Yeah, well, not everybody grew up
with a super-dad like Joe West,

30:57.814 --> 30:59.555
who makes it easy
to talk about your feelings.

31:02.986 --> 31:06.275
When I was 10 years old,
my dad walked out on me and my mom.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.273
And I was terrified.

31:08.992 --> 31:11.609
But my mom, she was even more afraid.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.454
So, you know,
I just started making jokes.

31:15.665 --> 31:19.500
Started doing stupid gags
and funny bits and...

31:20.212 --> 31:23.580
Whoopee cushions.
Anything to push her fear away.

31:25.092 --> 31:27.880
And the thing is after a while,
I started to push my fear away, too.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.678
I had no idea, Ralph, I...

31:31.390 --> 31:33.598
It's not that I don't care
about beating DeVoe.

31:34.851 --> 31:37.184
It's not that I don't care
about being a great hero.

31:38.355 --> 31:39.846
It's just that ever since then,

31:39.940 --> 31:42.603
anytime that I'm afraid,
I either hide...

31:44.361 --> 31:45.477
Or I make jokes.

31:48.115 --> 31:50.949
<i>Barry, we found Null,
Central City Museum.</i>

31:51.034 --> 31:53.651
So what do you say?
You wanna get off the bench?

31:53.745 --> 31:55.077
I really could use your help.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.450
Well, if duty calls.

31:57.541 --> 32:00.204
- You get it?
- Yeah. Let's just go, all right?

32:21.064 --> 32:24.307
Now this is my kind of party.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.154
Listen up, people.

32:30.240 --> 32:34.450
Anything that shines,
shimmers or sparkles,

32:34.536 --> 32:35.822
goes in the bag.

32:36.496 --> 32:40.456
Ooh, I love me some sapphires.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.743
You're out of your mind
if you think I'm giving this to you.

32:44.004 --> 32:47.122
Oh, give it to me? No, no, no, no, no.

32:47.215 --> 32:49.628
There's no need for that. No.

32:50.343 --> 32:51.879
I'll just take it.

32:57.392 --> 33:00.851
And the rest of you? Sparklies.

33:05.317 --> 33:07.229
Just hold on, all right? Just hold on.

33:10.906 --> 33:12.147
It's over, Null.

33:12.657 --> 33:14.489
So, back again.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.238
Oh, with a friend.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.035
A good friend, actually.
We hang out on the weekends,

33:18.121 --> 33:19.703
I know where he liv...

33:20.457 --> 33:22.494
- No getaway cars this time?
- Right.

33:22.876 --> 33:24.037
No cars.

33:24.127 --> 33:27.086
But there are an awful lot
of passengers.

33:33.595 --> 33:36.212
Oh, my God. She's gonna send
everyone into the atmosphere.

33:36.306 --> 33:38.138
Allen, you gotta get
everyone out of there right now.

33:43.230 --> 33:44.937
All right, that's everyone.
Where is she?

33:46.942 --> 33:48.899
- Whoa.
- No!

33:49.069 --> 33:50.856
Looking fly, Flash!

33:51.404 --> 33:52.986
Back to business.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.734
Oh, God!

34:07.003 --> 34:08.289
Guys, I can't reach him!

34:08.672 --> 34:10.755
Cisco, you have to breach him somewhere.

34:10.840 --> 34:12.922
He's too high in the atmosphere,
I don't have aim like that.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.469
- Let Ralph improvise.
- What?

34:17.931 --> 34:21.094
- What?
- Yes, do something Dibny-esque,

34:21.184 --> 34:23.016
be your own hero, just do it fast.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.638
Uh, "Dibny-esque," right. Um...

34:27.690 --> 34:29.478
Okay.

34:29.693 --> 34:30.934
All about that bling.

34:40.704 --> 34:41.694
Ralph!

34:42.871 --> 34:45.114
That was your plan?
He's gonna fall to his death.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.541
- I know what I'm doing.
- Any time, Ralph!

34:47.877 --> 34:51.791
10,000 feet, he's falling fast.
Now, 5,000 feet.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.729
Ralph did it.

35:21.161 --> 35:22.572
Nice work, Ralph.

35:23.163 --> 35:24.324
Nice work.

35:28.585 --> 35:29.621
Classy.

35:31.713 --> 35:32.954
You've gotta be kidding me.

35:38.720 --> 35:39.836
Ralph.

35:44.893 --> 35:49.058
All right, Null's in the pipeline.
She's not too happy about it.

35:49.606 --> 35:51.973
Well, she's a lot safer there
than she is on her own.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.979
Just one more bus meta out there.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.026
We better find him before DeVoe does.

35:56.655 --> 35:58.897
Where's Harry?
Isn't he supposed to be working on it?

35:58.990 --> 36:01.357
He grumbled something
about something and then left.

36:01.576 --> 36:04.444
I'm fluent in Harry grumble.
He said he was gonna work on his cap.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.450
Or he was making himself a turkey wrap.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.207
Well, I'm gonna head over
to C.C.P.D., do some more digging

36:10.293 --> 36:11.625
on this Edwin Gauss.

36:14.673 --> 36:15.663
Ralph.

36:16.633 --> 36:20.172
Why did a scared-sounding
Earl Cox call me saying

36:20.261 --> 36:21.672
he was clearing your tab?

36:22.430 --> 36:27.175
I have no idea.
That's really weird.

36:34.067 --> 36:37.185
Hey, guys, would you, uh,
help me in the speed lab?

36:37.487 --> 36:38.523
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

36:38.613 --> 36:39.774
We're gonna go work on some improv?

36:39.864 --> 36:41.571
Yeah.

36:43.910 --> 36:45.697
You were great out there tonight, man.

36:46.454 --> 36:47.490
Thank you.

36:47.580 --> 36:48.866
I had a lot of help.

36:49.541 --> 36:51.624
And I had a great teacher.

36:52.460 --> 36:53.826
You've helped me realize that

36:54.421 --> 36:57.004
I can't always take everything
so seriously,

36:57.090 --> 36:58.297
even when it comes to Thinker.

36:58.842 --> 37:02.552
Wait a second, are you telling me
that I, Ralph Dibny,

37:02.637 --> 37:06.130
taught Barry Allen,
superhero extraordinaire, a lesson?

37:06.599 --> 37:08.807
- What could this mean?
- Means you're a great hero.

37:09.310 --> 37:11.302
And you make this team
better by being on it.

37:11.396 --> 37:13.137
Ah, the circle is now complete.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.847
When I came here, I was but the learner,

37:14.941 --> 37:16.273
now I am the master.

37:16.651 --> 37:17.858
It's also good to be humble.

37:17.944 --> 37:18.980
But how can I be humble...

37:20.864 --> 37:22.446
When I am swollen with pride?

37:37.797 --> 37:40.414
- Cisky.
- Ah, jumpin' jellyfish!

37:43.595 --> 37:45.461
I like your new threads.

37:45.555 --> 37:47.763
Yeah.

37:47.849 --> 37:49.340
I went back to my Earth.

37:51.394 --> 37:53.226
Saw my reflection in my knife.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.389
I saw an older man.

37:56.733 --> 37:59.316
I'm curious. Have you never
looked in a mirror before?

37:59.402 --> 38:02.645
- I'm not a teenage girl.
- Okay, you're not a teenage girl.

38:03.865 --> 38:05.072
But I realized,

38:06.117 --> 38:07.653
time to hang up my coat.

38:08.661 --> 38:10.448
This is my new uniform.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.287
- Like it?
- Yeah.

38:12.582 --> 38:13.914
Retirement suits you.

38:15.001 --> 38:17.288
So, what do you do with all this time?

38:17.712 --> 38:19.453
There's a dragon farm

38:19.547 --> 38:23.086
on Earth-47 that I have
always wanted to visit.

38:23.635 --> 38:24.967
A dragon farm?

38:25.678 --> 38:27.920
Okay, get your Khaleesi on.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.425
I'm not a Khaleesi.

38:29.516 --> 38:30.848
Okay, you're not a Khaleesi.

38:30.934 --> 38:33.722
But, I just wanted to tell you, Cisky,

38:34.229 --> 38:35.390
goodbye forever.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.518
Oh, wait, just one more thing.

38:42.529 --> 38:43.645
Now that I've retired,

38:43.738 --> 38:45.980
there's an opening
at the collection agency.

38:46.366 --> 38:49.074
I would like you to replace me.

38:49.494 --> 38:51.907
Wait, I'm... I'm confused.

38:53.623 --> 38:55.159
You wanna see my daughter more?

38:55.583 --> 38:56.994
Work with her.

38:57.377 --> 39:01.621
Together, you and Cynthia
could be an unstoppable duo.

39:01.965 --> 39:03.547
So what do you say, Vibe?

39:04.384 --> 39:06.046
You wanna be the new Breacher?

39:16.020 --> 39:18.057
How was your rest, my love?

39:18.147 --> 39:20.730
Wonderful. I've never felt
more rejuvenated

39:20.817 --> 39:22.524
and ready to realize our dream.

39:22.610 --> 39:23.600
Clifford.

39:25.154 --> 39:29.694
The added combination of dark matter
from all our subject metas is

39:30.159 --> 39:32.401
overwhelming this host's body.

39:32.745 --> 39:34.361
How long do we have?

39:34.455 --> 39:36.071
At the present rate,

39:37.417 --> 39:38.999
exactly one week's time.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.952
No, I will not allow it.

39:42.255 --> 39:44.998
It may be possible to adjust
the biomass index,

39:45.091 --> 39:49.005
re-calibrate the energy distribution,
extend your current host's life.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.303
Odd.

39:52.473 --> 39:57.093
There are already plans for such
an adjustment partially designed.

39:59.647 --> 40:01.559
I attempted the same course of action.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.312
Well, you got quite a good start.

40:04.944 --> 40:08.437
I will be able to complete the designs
in under an hour.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.031
Rest, my love.

40:11.326 --> 40:12.862
I will handle everything.

40:15.997 --> 40:17.078
You always do.

40:18.458 --> 40:22.293
And then, when you complete your work,
we will continue

40:22.378 --> 40:26.543
on our journey to find
the remaining two bus metas.

40:27.216 --> 40:29.959
Team Flash has captured Subject 11.

40:30.637 --> 40:34.927
Now, it's time for us to act.

41:40.707 --> 41:42.164
<i>Good evening, Dr. Wells.</i>

41:42.250 --> 41:45.414
<i>It's been 1,078 days since
we last spoke.</i>

41:45.503 --> 41:47.119
<i>How can I be of service?</i>

41:47.213 --> 41:48.454
Hello, Gideon.

41:50.633 --> 41:52.625
A lot has changed since then.
