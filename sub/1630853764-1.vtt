31:26.559 --> 31:27.768
Then why am I doing it?

31:27.851 --> 31:30.059
Because I'm in charge.

31:30.143 --> 31:32.851
And you need to learn to fight
without your hands.

31:32.934 --> 31:34.768
You shouldn't have any problem
duckin' out the way

32:29.143 --> 32:31.726
I mean, the champion's tough
and he's unbeaten.

32:31.809 --> 32:33.393
And he's a dirty fighter.

32:33.476 --> 32:34.643
I don't care. I'm ready.

We gotta cut it right down

Don't even look like you.

of Jamaica in fact.

44:44.976 --> 44:46.559
Rushworth regards fighters

44:46.643 --> 44:51.268
as a money-making apparatus
with no other value.

44:51.351 --> 44:53.059
I simply believe
that when one man wins,

44:53.143 --> 44:55.434
another loses.
The thrill, as it were,

44:55.518 --> 44:57.976
is being on the side
of the victor.

44:58.059 --> 44:59.684
Wouldn't you agree, Jem?

44:59.768 --> 45:01.184
[gulps] I do.

45:01.268 --> 45:02.518
Then who am I to disagree

45:02.601 --> 45:04.643
with the new champion
of England?

45:04.726 --> 45:06.309
Now, of course, pugilism
has been around

45:06.393 --> 45:08.101
since the ancient Greeks,

45:08.184 --> 45:11.476
when it was a sport
of natural beauty

45:11.559 --> 45:14.559
or an artform,
and could be again.

45:14.643 --> 45:15.893
All God's creatures
are furnished

45:15.976 --> 45:17.309
with appendages
for their protection.

45:17.393 --> 45:19.893
So, why not turn them
into instruments of profit?

45:19.976 --> 45:22.976
But every fighter
should be one step ahead...

45:23.059 --> 45:24.934
so he can turn this
into a proper sport.

45:25.018 --> 45:28.018
And you're quiet right,
Lord Ashford.

45:28.101 --> 45:30.143
It should be viewed
as an artform.

45:30.226 --> 45:32.059
I couldn't agree with you more.

45:32.143 --> 45:35.018
I will help arrange
your next fight, Jem.

45:35.101 --> 45:38.184
There isn't a door in this city
that's closed to a lord.

45:38.268 --> 45:41.018
Yeah, well, that's very kind
of you, my lord.

45:41.101 --> 45:42.309
But we're fine for now.

45:42.393 --> 45:45.518
When opportunity knocks,
one must answer.

45:45.601 --> 45:49.434
[indistinct chatter]

45:49.518 --> 45:51.143
Speaking of opportunity...

45:54.601 --> 45:55.434
Bill.

45:58.059 --> 45:59.184
Excuse me.

46:03.893 --> 46:06.434
He's like a dog
with two cocks.

46:06.518 --> 46:08.684
[chuckles]

46:08.768 --> 46:10.518
[indistinct chatter]

46:10.601 --> 46:12.768
Give my best wishes
to your lovely wife.

46:12.851 --> 46:14.393
And all the best to you,
Lady Abigail.

46:14.476 --> 46:15.809
Thank you.

46:18.809 --> 46:21.018
Mr. Belcher.

46:21.101 --> 46:22.559
-Come.
-Yeah.

46:25.309 --> 46:26.726
[chuckles]

46:26.809 --> 46:28.434
So...

46:28.518 --> 46:31.476
is this your first exposure
to high society?

46:31.559 --> 46:33.018
It is.

46:33.101 --> 46:37.393
Well, the party was meant
to be for the Irishman.

46:37.476 --> 46:38.309
But...

46:39.351 --> 46:41.101
not sure he felt
like celebrating.

46:41.184 --> 46:42.768
[chuckles]

46:42.851 --> 46:44.393
You-- you saw the fight?

46:44.476 --> 46:45.893
Well and truly.

46:47.434 --> 46:48.976
Are women not permitted
at such events?

46:49.059 --> 46:51.851
[chuckles awkwardly]
Yes, of course. I mean...

46:51.934 --> 46:54.851
usually, I... I see
a different type of women

46:54.934 --> 46:57.059
at the... fight.

46:57.143 --> 46:58.851
[chuckles] I mean... well...

46:58.934 --> 47:00.518
Have I made you uncomfortable,
Jem?

47:02.226 --> 47:03.268
-No.
-[Lady Abigail chuckles]

47:03.351 --> 47:05.684
-Good.
-[chuckles]

47:05.768 --> 47:07.309
You'd be surprised
at how many women

47:07.393 --> 47:09.309
enjoy the spectacle.

47:09.393 --> 47:11.101
You'll find many women
in the crowds.

47:12.976 --> 47:14.684
You just have to take notice.

47:18.059 --> 47:20.059
-[chuckles]
-[indistinct chatter]

47:20.143 --> 47:21.184
The new champ toys have arrived.

47:21.268 --> 47:23.059
-Get me one.
-Make way.

47:23.143 --> 47:24.101
[grunts]

47:26.893 --> 47:29.309
Whoa! They look so real!

47:29.393 --> 47:34.393
[♪♪♪]

48:10.893 --> 48:12.643
In the meantime,
we'll have some fun.

48:12.726 --> 48:14.851
[smooches]

48:14.934 --> 48:16.309
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

48:18.684 --> 48:21.101
Classy dresser.

48:21.184 --> 48:22.101
Mm.

[speaks Spanish]

48:33.934 --> 48:34.601
Huh?

48:34.684 --> 48:36.434
What are you drinking, Jem?

48:36.518 --> 48:37.434
Give me some.

48:39.601 --> 48:41.268
[chuckles]

48:41.351 --> 48:42.351
Champ.

48:47.268 --> 48:48.309
[smooches, chuckles]

48:48.393 --> 48:49.726
[exotic woman giggles]

48:50.601 --> 48:52.059

[laughs]

49:13.518 --> 49:15.434
[grunts]

49:15.518 --> 49:17.851
Loosen up.

49:17.934 --> 49:19.351
[grunts, groans]

49:19.434 --> 49:20.184
How daunting.

-Yes.

-[crowd cheering]
-Hey!

49:26.351 --> 49:28.934
[laughs]

49:29.018 --> 49:30.809
Well done, well done!

49:30.893 --> 49:33.684
[chuckles]

49:35.934 --> 49:38.393
We need more of that.
Spectacle!

49:38.476 --> 49:40.643
[spits]

49:40.726 --> 49:42.143
[laughs]

49:42.226 --> 49:44.851
Well, that was a different
approach, wasn't it?

49:44.934 --> 49:46.143
Fantastic spectacle.

49:46.226 --> 49:47.309
Well done, well done.

49:49.518 --> 49:51.226
Mr. Warr.

49:51.309 --> 49:52.268
Hmm.

49:52.351 --> 49:55.351
[laughs]

49:56.851 --> 49:58.184
LORD RUSHWORTH:
So, Mr. Egan,

49:58.268 --> 50:00.768
will that demonstration
excite your readers?

50:00.851 --> 50:02.226
EGAN:
Indeed, my lord, it will.

50:02.309 --> 50:04.893
[Rushworth laughs]

50:07.643 --> 50:08.934
DOCK SELLER:
Fresh bread!

50:09.018 --> 50:10.893
Come and get your fresh bread.

50:10.976 --> 50:13.268
Go on, step up. There you go.

50:13.351 --> 50:14.351
There’s two for you, darling.

50:14.434 --> 50:15.476
BOY:
There they are.
It's Jem's mum.

50:15.559 --> 50:16.559
DOCK SELLER:
Fresh bread, anyone?

50:16.643 --> 50:18.601
Come on, everyone. Fresh bread.

50:18.684 --> 50:21.309
Fresh bread, ladies?

50:21.393 --> 50:23.268
You must be proud of your boy,
Mary.

50:23.351 --> 50:26.351
Jem Belcher.
Champion of England.

50:26.434 --> 50:29.018
He beat Andrew Gamble
black and blue.

50:29.101 --> 50:30.726
GILLY:
Yeah, you're right.

50:33.726 --> 50:35.934
[inhales, exhales]

50:37.226 --> 50:39.018
Mm.

50:39.101 --> 50:41.018
Champion of England?

50:41.101 --> 50:42.101
Here, Ma.

50:46.643 --> 50:49.184
What's taking you so long?

50:49.268 --> 50:50.393
I'm just getting used to it.

50:50.476 --> 50:51.684
It's really very simple.

50:51.768 --> 50:54.143
You bet the checks
on your best five cards.

50:54.226 --> 50:57.143
What use is it to invent a game

50:57.226 --> 50:59.434
only to have it outlawed
a few years later?

50:59.518 --> 51:00.976
[chuckles] What do you expect?

51:01.059 --> 51:01.768
That's the French for you.

51:01.851 --> 51:03.726
Everything they do is backwards.

51:03.809 --> 51:06.268
Who do you suppose
will be your next opponent?

51:06.351 --> 51:08.184
That depends on who's left.

51:08.268 --> 51:10.809
The ring has invigorated
English life.

51:10.893 --> 51:13.143
A life you'll never find
in William Wordsworth.

51:13.226 --> 51:17.143
Fighting provides a stepladder
for a pauper to become a prince.

51:17.226 --> 51:19.976
I agree. But reading poetry should not be discounted

51:20.059 --> 51:21.893
as a worthy pursuit.

51:21.976 --> 51:24.768
I confess that I myself
have quite a penchant

51:24.851 --> 51:25.643
for Mr. Wordsworth.

51:25.726 --> 51:27.726
-So do Dandies.
-[laughs]

51:27.809 --> 51:31.268
Soon, there will be ranks
and weight classes.

51:31.351 --> 51:34.101
Men will need to reach
and earn a certain level

51:34.184 --> 51:35.851
before challenging anyone.

51:35.934 --> 51:36.893
Yes, a fight's a fight, Egan.

51:36.976 --> 51:39.684
Let's not get bogged down
in technicalities.

51:39.768 --> 51:41.143
[chuckles]

51:41.226 --> 51:42.643
On that note.

51:42.726 --> 51:43.601
[Ashford chuckles]

51:43.684 --> 51:46.393
I thought you were just
getting used to it.

51:47.893 --> 51:49.476
Oh! Fold.

51:49.559 --> 51:50.851
I am out.

51:50.934 --> 51:53.101
Shall we raise the stakes
before the last turn?

51:53.184 --> 51:54.726
You know what,
it's not worth it.

51:54.809 --> 51:56.518
He bets like the king.

51:56.601 --> 51:59.351
Victory and defeat lie in wait
side by side.

52:03.184 --> 52:04.351
[Jem smacks lips]

52:04.434 --> 52:05.643
All in, my lord.

52:07.976 --> 52:09.184
I'll join you.

52:18.601 --> 52:21.309
-Oh!
-[chuckles]

52:21.393 --> 52:22.309
Kings are rarely beaten.

52:22.393 --> 52:24.434
But the ace trumps the king.
Well done.

52:24.518 --> 52:25.809
[thumping]

52:25.893 --> 52:26.726
EGAN:
Very good. Very good.

52:26.809 --> 52:29.018
-[Lady Ashford chuckling]
-Another round, please, Jerry.

52:32.059 --> 52:35.893
Your lordship, could I have a...
a private word, please?

52:35.976 --> 52:37.143
Spit it out.

52:37.226 --> 52:39.059
JERRY:
Yes, my lord.
I... I do beg your pardon.

52:39.143 --> 52:41.643
It's just your line of credit
is rather high

52:41.726 --> 52:44.059
and over its limit.

52:44.143 --> 52:46.059
[clears throat]

52:46.143 --> 52:48.268
Are you trying to embarrass me?

52:48.351 --> 52:50.101
No. Not at all. It's just--

52:50.184 --> 52:53.101
-[chokes]
-Pitiful scum.

52:53.184 --> 52:54.434
I could burn this place down
tonight

52:54.518 --> 52:56.518
and no one would give
two fucks!

52:56.601 --> 52:58.018
Stop it, Rushworth.

52:58.101 --> 53:01.226
I didn't mean to offend you,
my lord, I swear.

53:01.309 --> 53:02.476
LORD ASHFORD:
Shame on you, sir.

53:02.559 --> 53:04.684
This is not the conduct
becoming an officer

53:04.768 --> 53:07.976
in His Majesty's Navy,
retired or not.

53:09.768 --> 53:10.643

54:07.601 --> 54:09.643
Yeah, it is.

54:11.809 --> 54:13.976
Tom and Gilly ask about you
a lot.

54:14.059 --> 54:16.309
[birds chirping in distance]

54:16.393 --> 54:19.018
Everywhere I go nowadays
someone asks about you.

54:23.726 --> 54:25.018
I miss them.

54:27.351 --> 54:28.851
I miss you, too.

54:35.434 --> 54:36.643
You can come back home
whenever you want.

54:36.726 --> 54:37.893
You know that, don't you?

54:39.851 --> 54:41.018
Yeah.

Well, there's always someone
worth watchin' out for.

what else matters?

[thump]

55:10.976 --> 55:11.684
What's that for?

55:11.768 --> 55:15.768
Champion or challenger,
you turn up on my camp on time.

55:15.851 --> 55:18.184
I am the champion.

55:18.268 --> 55:20.143
Ain't that enough for you?

55:20.226 --> 55:22.643
Well,
you're gonna make a choice.

55:22.726 --> 55:25.601
You either train like a champion

55:25.684 --> 55:27.518
or you get ready to be a loser.

you've called me a loser, Bill.

[♪♪♪]

56:01.268 --> 56:03.768
Welcome to Fives.

56:03.851 --> 56:04.809
So, what's the occasion?

56:04.893 --> 56:07.143
Celebration of the well-heeled,
the wealthy,

56:07.226 --> 56:09.351
and the immovability
of our status.

56:09.434 --> 56:11.268
-[chuckles]
-I see.

56:11.351 --> 56:13.559
Hierarchies exist everywhere.

56:13.643 --> 56:15.518
They're a natural course
of life.

56:16.851 --> 56:18.059
Is that your theory, My Lord?

56:18.143 --> 56:20.268
Uh, not a theory, but a fact.

56:20.351 --> 56:23.309
You need only look
at the animal kingdom, hmm,

56:23.393 --> 56:25.976
that are tuned to status
in the same way we are.

56:26.059 --> 56:27.768
We are made to live this way.

56:29.393 --> 56:31.226
I do hope you're enjoying.

56:31.309 --> 56:32.809
We are living in a golden age,
Jem.

56:32.893 --> 56:35.059

Can't say I have.

56:45.518 --> 56:46.893
They can be nasty bastards.

56:46.976 --> 56:48.434
I fought with one.

You know what I love
about fighting?

56:59.101 --> 56:59.851
What's that?

56:59.934 --> 57:02.934
It's the only sport where money
is made by men doing somethin'

57:03.018 --> 57:05.143
they'd ordinarily be
locked up for.

57:06.601 --> 57:08.226
Never thought of it
like that before.

Ladies and gentlemen, myself,
Your Lordship

Do you good.

59:14.684 --> 59:15.684
I'm fine.

Your absence these past weeks
has sent tongues wagging.

1:00:17.184 --> 1:00:18.601
I'm ready for the next fight.

1:00:18.684 --> 1:00:20.559
I admire your optimism, Jem,

1:00:20.643 --> 1:00:22.768
we must take things one step
at a time.

1:00:22.851 --> 1:00:24.643
Like I said,
bring me a challenger

1:00:24.726 --> 1:00:25.809
and I'll defend my title.

1:00:25.893 --> 1:00:26.768
I'm sure you will,

1:00:26.851 --> 1:00:31.976
however I have a responsibility
to deliver what the people want.

1:00:32.059 --> 1:00:34.434
The people want me,
not the challenger.

1:00:34.518 --> 1:00:36.226
Don't be naïve, Jem.

1:00:36.309 --> 1:00:38.476
This is a great spectacle
of human courage

1:00:38.559 --> 1:00:40.018
we're talking about.

1:00:40.101 --> 1:00:42.393
It means engineering it first.

1:00:44.601 --> 1:00:48.143
I sell out crowds
who pay to see me fight.

1:00:48.226 --> 1:00:49.893

We are telling them a story,

must come struggle.

1:00:59.934 --> 1:01:04.768
I struggled to become
Champion of England!

-Isn't that enough?
-Yeah.

1:01:09.268 --> 1:01:12.851
Your story's not yet
reached its conclusion, Jem.

People wanted
to see its final chapter.

1:01:16.601 --> 1:01:18.101
You won't control me.

1:01:20.018 --> 1:01:22.768
And you won't control
the people.

Without the people, Jem,

every day?

1:11:11.768 --> 1:11:13.643
Yeah, probably.

1:11:13.726 --> 1:11:15.518
London's a big fairground.
