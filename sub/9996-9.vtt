Family. It's our rock. Our salvation.

00:05.800 --> 00:09.180
These are the people we are
closest to in the whole world.

00:09.190 --> 00:12.400
They share our dreams.
They share our blood.

00:12.830 --> 00:17.640
And yet it's often those closest to us
who are capable of hurting us most deeply.

00:17.650 --> 00:19.930
"To be or not to be".

00:19.970 --> 00:23.180
That was not the question in
Hamlet.

00:23.220 --> 00:29.010
The question was: "How could my uncle
kill my father and marry my mother?"

00:29.330 --> 00:32.700
Is this what they mean
by family entertainment?

00:32.710 --> 00:35.090
Real life is even more frightening.

00:35.120 --> 00:39.330
A world-famous football player
is accused of garroting his wife.

00:39.340 --> 00:43.480
Two brothers are found guilty
of massacring their parents.

00:43.490 --> 00:48.310
And the government tells us that almost
16% of the murders committed in this country

00:48.350 --> 00:52.660
are perpetrated by one
family member against another.

No one will ever know it was you.

01:19.690 --> 01:20.980
Everything okay?

01:21.020 --> 01:24.440
Oh, my God, I just... I just
had the worst nightmare.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.590
Did you hear what you just said?

01:26.630 --> 01:28.910
No, I mean it, it was just...

01:28.930 --> 01:31.090
it was truly a nightmare.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.910
Just, you know, a bad dream.

01:33.950 --> 01:37.560
Something that would never happen.
Something that could never happen.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.970
Just a bad dream.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.820
A bad dream? Could never happen?

01:45.250 --> 01:47.080
Excellent.

All In The Family

02:36.330 --> 02:38.080
Oh, yeah.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.100
Sunday morning. What are you doing up?

02:46.110 --> 02:48.080
Oh, I heard you and mom in the kitchen.

02:48.110 --> 02:50.460
Yeah, well, Mom's got to go in to work
for a couple of hours this morning, 

02:50.490 --> 02:53.340
so I just thought I'd keep her
company while she ate breakfast.

02:53.370 --> 02:55.440
Look who I found in the hallway.

02:55.460 --> 02:57.100
Hey, your sisters aren't up yet, are they?

02:57.110 --> 02:58.730
No. Just me.

02:58.740 --> 03:02.560
I actually want to talk to you guys about
something without everyone else around.

03:02.910 --> 03:04.900
okay.

03:04.930 --> 03:09.560
Uh, well, last night, after the movies, 
Ashley's dad invited me, Madison, and Carla

03:09.570 --> 03:12.440
to go skiing at his cabin
in Flagstaff next weekend.

03:12.820 --> 03:15.290
That's awfully nice of him. I think.

03:15.300 --> 03:19.310
No, it is. So would it just be, uh, you
three girls and Ashley's dad?

03:19.320 --> 03:22.540
Uh, well, Ashley's older
brother Jamie will be there.

03:22.550 --> 03:26.130
And I, uh, think he's bringing
a few of his friends, too.

03:26.140 --> 03:27.620
How much older is Ashley's...

03:27.650 --> 03:29.560
He's a senior.

03:31.130 --> 03:32.380
I'd really like to go.

03:32.420 --> 03:35.440
I know skiing is expensive, but
I could use babysitting money.

03:35.490 --> 03:38.970
And they want to leave around noon on Friday, 
which means missing everything after fourth period, 

03:38.980 --> 03:41.300
but I haven't been absent all year.

03:41.330 --> 03:46.270
Um, well, honey, this is really something that Daddy
and I need to talk about and I-I got to go now.

03:47.760 --> 03:48.730
Okay.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.290
But I promise we'll talk later, okay?

03:51.310 --> 03:53.980
- Hey, um, can you walk me out?
- Yeah.

03:57.580 --> 04:01.290
- Senior boys.
- When did she get to be so old?

04:02.970 --> 04:04.970
Can you hold that, please?

04:05.420 --> 04:07.450
Thank you.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.550
Don't be afraid.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.120
It was a car accident.

04:22.130 --> 04:23.240
I'm sorry?

04:23.260 --> 04:25.690
You were wondering about my scar, right?

04:26.030 --> 04:28.930
I was in a car accident
a few years back.

04:28.940 --> 04:30.790
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...

04:30.800 --> 04:33.300
I'm used to it.

04:35.490 --> 04:36.990
Oh, well this is convenient.

04:37.020 --> 04:39.340
Did you all actually meet?

04:39.370 --> 04:42.170
Allison Dubois, this is
Dylan and Brooke Hoyt.

04:42.190 --> 04:43.440
Detective Scanlon.

04:43.470 --> 04:45.470
Mr. and Mrs. Hoyt.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.100
We're brother and sister.

04:49.200 --> 04:52.860
I'm... the official psychic.

04:53.280 --> 04:54.590
Nice to meet you, Brooke.

04:54.620 --> 04:56.930
And you, Allison. Detective Scanlon.

04:56.940 --> 05:00.380
Brooke and Dylan are the children
of a dear old acquaintance of mine.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.210
I went to college with their mother.

05:02.240 --> 05:04.100
I really appreciate you
all seeing us on a Sunday.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.740
Of course. Please.

05:06.780 --> 05:09.250
The last time I actually spoke
to Mom was Thursday night.

05:09.290 --> 05:11.370
We made a date to have lunch.

05:11.400 --> 05:14.990
Friday I drove over to her place
and her car wasn't in the driveway.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.110
I have a key. I went into the house.

05:17.120 --> 05:19.290
She was nowhere to be found.

05:19.300 --> 05:24.190
I went down to the police, they said if she didn't
turn up after 48 hours we could file a report.

05:24.460 --> 05:25.760
We did that last night.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.410
We're sitting there.Filling
out all the paperwork, 

05:27.420 --> 05:30.000
talking to this very
bored-looking officer and I, I just, 

05:30.030 --> 05:31.760
frankly, I felt like we
needed to pull some strings.

05:31.790 --> 05:37.120
This woman has been gone at least three days, and
we can't seem to get anybody excited about that.

05:37.440 --> 05:39.000
So that's when I thought
about calling you.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.960
And I'm happy to help. As you
know, I'm very fond of your mother.

05:42.530 --> 05:46.720
But the truth is, missing people
are the province of the police.

05:46.740 --> 05:49.780
Now I've asked Detective
Scanlon to sit with us

05:49.790 --> 05:53.060
so that he can liaise with
the department on your behalf.

05:53.070 --> 05:56.860
And I've asked Allison to
be here because, well, frankly, 

05:56.880 --> 05:59.980
um, she's an invaluable resource
in these kind of matters.

06:00.000 --> 06:03.100
But at the end of the day, 
if she is truly missing, 

06:03.110 --> 06:05.400
it's police that we have
to depend upon to find her.

06:05.430 --> 06:09.290
The key phrase being "if
she truly is missing."

06:09.300 --> 06:13.760
Which is why I have to ask if you're sure
that she didn't just take a trip somewhere.

06:13.770 --> 06:17.790
Look, you wouldn't know it from looking
at her, but she's not a well woman.

06:17.820 --> 06:19.370
She's had diabetes for years.

06:19.410 --> 06:22.290
She has to give herself
three injections a day.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.270
Her kidneys are starting to fail, she has to
go to the hospital for dialysis treatments.

06:25.310 --> 06:28.350
So, no, spontaneous travel is not
something she's inclined to do.

06:28.380 --> 06:29.800
What is she inclined to do?

06:29.830 --> 06:33.100
Does she have any hobbies?
Uh, does she like to shop?

06:33.360 --> 06:35.240
She likes nature.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.860
She likes to bike; she likes to hike.

06:37.890 --> 06:41.330
Even after she started getting
really sick, she wouldn't slow down.

06:41.340 --> 06:45.080
I always worry, what if
she gets hurt or lost?

06:45.120 --> 06:48.510
I mean, what if she doesn't
have enough insulin?

06:52.860 --> 06:55.590
I'm begging you. She won't
even return my phone calls.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.750
Brooke, you've got to talk to Mom for me.

07:00.230 --> 07:03.770
I don't think I can do
that, Dylan. Mom's cut you off.

07:03.780 --> 07:07.100
- She doesn't want anything to do with you.
- I know what she wants!

07:11.060 --> 07:13.240
I know what she wants.

07:13.670 --> 07:15.810
But I need money.

07:16.310 --> 07:18.700
I have debts.

07:19.060 --> 07:21.940
Debts you can't make late payments on.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.830
Brooke, please.

07:24.840 --> 07:27.510
Just explain to her that I'm in trouble.

07:27.540 --> 07:30.250
And that I will pay her back.

07:30.670 --> 07:31.920
I'm starting a new business.

07:31.930 --> 07:33.490
Another new business.

07:33.510 --> 07:36.440
You've come up with yet
another way to lose money.

07:37.070 --> 07:39.170
- You're amazing.
- That's not fair.

07:39.180 --> 07:42.840
Look, I'm not talking to Mom for you.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.910
Sorry. I can't.

07:45.920 --> 07:48.660
When it comes to you, I
happen to agree with her.

07:49.020 --> 07:50.610
I think you're an embarrassment.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.630
I'm glad she cut you off.

07:53.080 --> 07:55.910
I'm asking one more time.

08:02.110 --> 08:04.570
Those two have sure come a long way.

08:04.580 --> 08:06.710
Excuse me?

08:06.720 --> 08:09.050
Oh, I just saw something back there.

08:09.060 --> 08:11.290
Must've been a few years ago.

08:11.300 --> 08:14.290
Brooke didn't have that
scar on her face; not yet.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.050
They were fighting about money.

08:16.070 --> 08:18.550
It got bad and Dylan pulled a gun.

08:18.570 --> 08:21.060
Looked like they got along fine to me.

08:21.440 --> 08:24.490
Well, like I said, it
was a long time ago.

08:29.370 --> 08:31.310
Is someone supposed to
be coming over, Daddy?

08:31.330 --> 08:33.750
Not that I know of.

08:38.100 --> 08:40.390
- Hey, there.
- Sis.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.270
Wha... what are you doing here?

08:46.280 --> 08:48.910
My ma-marriage...

08:49.620 --> 08:53.320
I don't understand. You
two always looked so happy.

08:54.390 --> 08:57.150
I guess we're both good actors.

08:57.440 --> 09:01.290
The truth is, we've been having
a hard time for a while now.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.560
The marriage is barely running on fumes.

09:03.570 --> 09:06.240
Okay. But it is running, right?

09:10.320 --> 09:13.270
Okay, Sara's all set up in Ariel's room.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.650
Ariel's in with Bridgette and Marie.

09:15.690 --> 09:17.260
She didn't look very happy about it.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.850
She kept asking if we'd
talked about the, uh, ski trip.

09:20.860 --> 09:24.230
I really hope we're on
the same page with this, 

09:24.240 --> 09:27.430
'cause I think that we're going to
have to deal with this tomorrow morning.

09:27.440 --> 09:33.430
You mean, the page where 15-and-a-half-year-old girls
don't go on niernight trips with 18-year-old boys?

09:33.440 --> 09:36.430
Yeah. I think we're of
the same mind on that.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.410
Sara asked me to thank you again.

09:38.460 --> 09:41.440
It's fine. She's thanked
me already, four times.

09:41.450 --> 09:45.370
Did I thank you? Thank you.

09:45.380 --> 09:47.560
I know my sister can be
a little much sometimes.

09:47.610 --> 09:49.270
It's fine.

09:49.310 --> 09:51.850
How many times have
we put my brother up?

09:53.790 --> 09:56.720
You know, I know this
doesn't matter, but...

09:56.730 --> 09:59.140
I always kind of liked Ryan.

10:00.320 --> 10:03.300
I always felt my sister
was lucky to have him.

10:03.310 --> 10:05.390
Well, don't start mourning yet.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.060
The marriage isn't necessarily over.

10:07.090 --> 10:11.200
This very well be act
one in a very long play.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.850
Besides, we don't even
know if it's true yet.

10:13.860 --> 10:16.080
I mean, he never seemed like
the cheating type to me.

10:16.110 --> 10:18.860
I know; that's what I thought.

10:18.900 --> 10:22.770
Who knows? Maybe she'll come to
her senses and want to go back home.

10:27.640 --> 10:29.360
Honey?

10:30.020 --> 10:32.350
Dylan, I'm home!

10:33.850 --> 10:35.020
Dylan?

10:35.030 --> 10:37.030
I'm out in the garage.

10:39.260 --> 10:41.730
Hey, babe. What are you
doing out here in the dark?

10:45.280 --> 10:47.620
My God, Dylan, what are you doing?

10:47.630 --> 10:50.790
What is that? What's going on?

10:51.220 --> 10:55.100
I told her I needed money. We
needed money. Wouldn't listen.

10:56.610 --> 10:58.790
I didn't mean to kill her.

10:58.820 --> 11:00.910
Oh, my God.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.200
I've thought this through.

11:04.230 --> 11:06.660
Everything's going to be
fine. We're going to be fine.

11:06.670 --> 11:09.220
We just have to work together.

11:09.470 --> 11:12.300
We just have to each do our part.

11:13.460 --> 11:16.980
Now, me-- I'll take
care of the body.

11:17.000 --> 11:19.670
I'll put it in my car, I'll drive
somewhere far away and I'll bury it.

11:19.680 --> 11:21.770
You don't need to have
anything to do with that.

11:22.090 --> 11:24.580
Oh, God. Oh, Dylan.

11:24.590 --> 11:28.350
I need you to take care of her car.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.510
It's parked out front;
we can't leave it there.

11:31.520 --> 11:34.720
I need you to drive it to the
airport, to long-term parking.

11:34.740 --> 11:37.810
Just drive it in there, 
lock the door, walk away.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.450
Once you do that, call me and
I'll pick you up. Can you do that?

11:44.880 --> 11:46.880
She's alive.

12:06.420 --> 12:08.590
You awake?

12:10.020 --> 12:12.400
Do you smell that?

12:17.510 --> 12:19.460
Here you go.

12:21.300 --> 12:22.900
Hey, check it out, you guys.

12:22.930 --> 12:24.570
Aunt Sara made tofu.

12:24.580 --> 12:26.340
Tofu... oh, boy.

12:26.350 --> 12:28.620
- Morning.
- Good morning.

12:28.940 --> 12:32.820
I figured while I was here, I'd teach
the girls what being a vegan's all about, 

12:32.830 --> 12:36.300
see if I couldn't recruit
a couple of converts.

12:36.310 --> 12:39.040
Did you guys know that meat is murder?

12:39.050 --> 12:41.990
No, I hadn't heard that.

12:42.660 --> 12:45.160
Can I be excused?

12:48.030 --> 12:49.880
I'll be right back.

12:53.180 --> 12:55.430
- Yeah?
- You all right?

12:56.230 --> 12:58.450
How long is she staying here?

12:59.420 --> 13:01.430
Through the weekend maybe.

13:01.440 --> 13:03.990
You have to let me go on that ski trip.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.850
What does that have to do with this?

13:05.860 --> 13:07.710
It has everything to do with this.

13:07.750 --> 13:11.060
With her here, I don't have a place to
sleep, I don't have a place to change.

13:11.090 --> 13:12.850
I can't even eat the foods that I like.

13:12.870 --> 13:14.940
Honey, I think you're
being a little dramatic.

13:14.980 --> 13:16.850
Really?

13:17.230 --> 13:19.800
Did you know that Bridgette snores?

13:20.240 --> 13:21.230
It's true.

13:21.260 --> 13:25.920
And Marie thinks that it's hysterical, 
so she laughs all night long.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.340
Laughing and snoring.

13:27.370 --> 13:28.770
Snoring and laughing.

13:28.790 --> 13:33.160
It's not funny. I didn't sleep at all.

13:33.170 --> 13:36.880
Okay, hey, so that's why Dad and I are
supposed to let you go on an overnight

13:36.890 --> 13:38.630
with a bunch of
18-year-old boys?

13:38.670 --> 13:40.520
I never should have told
you about her brother.

13:40.560 --> 13:44.180
Right-- lying-- absolutely--
that would've sealed the deal.

13:44.650 --> 13:47.030
You know what, honey? I got to get ready
for work, you got to get ready for school.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.190
Why don't we talk about this
tonight sisters are asep?

13:50.220 --> 13:51.440
"Tonight" what?

13:51.470 --> 13:55.080
Your mind's made up, Dad's
mind's made up, so just forget it.

13:55.090 --> 13:57.780
- Okay, fine.
- Fine!

14:07.490 --> 14:10.760
She's got no business
putting you through this.

14:10.770 --> 14:13.230
What are you talking about?
What are you doing here?

14:13.240 --> 14:16.090
I'm talking about my daughter Sara.

14:16.110 --> 14:19.820
She's got no business inflicting
herself on you and Joe, 

14:19.830 --> 14:23.090
particularly since her husband
hasn't done anything wrong.

14:23.100 --> 14:26.260
That man's as faithful as a dog.

14:26.270 --> 14:28.390
Are you sure?

14:28.420 --> 14:30.330
Am I sure?

14:30.830 --> 14:33.210
I'm dead, aren't I?

14:34.360 --> 14:36.010
So what are you saying?

14:36.040 --> 14:38.870
This has all been some
big misunderstanding?

14:38.900 --> 14:44.300
This, my dear Ally, is
just Sara being Sara.

14:44.310 --> 14:47.760
I mean, I love her to
death-- literally--

14:47.790 --> 14:53.700
but believe me when I tell you my little girl never
saw a molehill that she couldn't turn into a mountain.

14:54.450 --> 14:57.720
Now... you need to fix this.

14:58.100 --> 15:02.690
You need to get her to understand
that she is screwing up a good thing.

15:02.700 --> 15:07.600
Ryan is her one chance for true
happiness, and she is going to ruin it.

15:10.440 --> 15:11.670
Yes?

15:11.710 --> 15:15.570
Hey, no fair hiding. If I got to eat
bean curd for breakfast, so do you.

15:18.530 --> 15:21.510
I'm sorry. We really need to talk.

15:22.650 --> 15:27.740
I can't even begin to imagine how to
have this conversation with my sister.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.180
I think it's pretty straightforward.

15:29.220 --> 15:32.110
You just tell her that your
dead father stopped by to swear

15:32.120 --> 15:34.380
that her husband wasn't cheating on her.

15:34.390 --> 15:36.510
Look, she's read about me in the papers.

15:36.550 --> 15:37.940
I'm sure she'll understand.

15:37.980 --> 15:39.500
Well, I sure don't doubt
that she'll understand.

15:39.540 --> 15:41.890
I'm just not certain that
she's going to believe.

15:41.900 --> 15:43.840
What, Sara?

15:43.860 --> 15:47.890
I'm sorry, she strikes me as the
poster child for people who believe.

15:48.630 --> 15:50.420
Oh, I got to get to work in 30 minutes.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.160
Um, so I'll pick up the girls
from school this afternoon

15:53.180 --> 15:55.250
and then I'll have a talk
with her when I get back.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.830
Hopefully I can convince
her to go home tonight.

15:57.860 --> 16:00.110
Oh, wouldn't that be great?

16:01.910 --> 16:02.830
Mrs. Dubois.

16:02.860 --> 16:06.720
I'm sorry to show up unannounced, Mr. Hoyt, but
I was working on your mother's case last night, 

16:06.760 --> 16:08.910
and I think I had a real breakthrough.

16:08.930 --> 16:10.390
Is this a bad time?

16:10.410 --> 16:13.940
Come on in, please. Are you
saying you know where she is?

16:14.270 --> 16:16.140
Does Brooke know?

16:16.150 --> 16:20.530
W
- What kind of breakthrough are we talking about exactly?

16:20.540 --> 16:22.720
Boy, I really don't see
a woman's touch here.

16:22.740 --> 16:24.450
No.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.210
Why would you?

16:26.240 --> 16:28.500
I don't know, I guess I just assumed.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.060
You live here with Harmony, right?

16:32.030 --> 16:37.430
Well, I could have sworn the district attorney mentioned
that you were engaged to someone named Harmony?

16:38.560 --> 16:43.630
Harmony, um, yeah--
no, not...

16:43.980 --> 16:46.600
for a long time. I haven't
seen Harmony in years.

16:49.540 --> 16:52.850
Does Harmony have something to do with
the breakthrough you had about my mother?

16:52.880 --> 16:54.600
Well, I thought she did.

16:54.610 --> 16:57.100
Maybe I was mistaken.

16:57.130 --> 16:59.270
This is embarrassing.

16:59.290 --> 17:01.360
So you're no longer engaged?

17:01.390 --> 17:04.700
Not for about four years now.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.250
She broke it off just
before the wedding.

17:08.579 --> 17:12.140
Sent me a note, said she was
leaving the country. I...

17:13.099 --> 17:15.690
haven't seen her since.

17:16.839 --> 17:21.540
I don't understand; are you suggesting that she might've
had something to do with my mother's disappearance?

17:21.880 --> 17:23.140
I don't know what I'm saying.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.829
I'm sorry for wasting your time.

17:24.849 --> 17:27.849
I'm s-- I'm confused, though;
like, I just, I mean...

17:28.260 --> 17:30.900
at least tell me what
brought you here this morning.

17:30.930 --> 17:36.310
I don't know that it matters, but I got this picture
in my head about the night that your mom disappeared.

17:36.350 --> 17:39.520
And yeah, there was someone
named Harmony in it.

17:39.860 --> 17:42.730
Although... that makes no sense and...

17:42.740 --> 17:44.650
and actually you were in it.

17:44.680 --> 17:47.930
Okay, well, that-- I'm
sorry, but thatiscrazy

17:47.960 --> 17:51.670
'cause like I said, I
haven't seen her in forever.

17:51.680 --> 17:55.710
Besides, I was at Brooke's, 
talking about Mom, actually--

17:55.740 --> 17:58.210
her health, everything.

17:58.220 --> 18:00.690
Kind of ironic.

18:00.730 --> 18:03.030
Got pretty drunk.

18:03.070 --> 18:05.950
We both did. I ended up staying the
night; she didn't want me driving.

18:08.140 --> 18:12.020
I'm plastered-- we're both
plastered-- and our mom is...

18:14.580 --> 18:17.570
I'm sorry for getting
your hopes up, Mr. Hoyt.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.540
Don't be.

18:22.040 --> 18:25.510
Knock-knock. Can I come in?

18:25.520 --> 18:28.010
Pull up a chair.

18:28.850 --> 18:34.750
So I thought about what you said, about your dream, 
about Dylan and the fiancÃ©e killing the mom, 

18:34.770 --> 18:37.700
about how that made no sense
since there is no fiancÃ©e, 

18:37.730 --> 18:40.830
about how he's got an airtight alibi
'cause he was with his sister all night, 

18:40.860 --> 18:42.560
so I did a little research.

18:42.570 --> 18:45.770
You want to see something else that
doesn't make a whole lot of sense?

18:52.080 --> 18:54.550
You know what that is?

18:55.390 --> 18:57.020
Of course I know what it is.

18:57.040 --> 18:58.640
It's a restraining order.

18:58.700 --> 19:02.660
It's a restraining order you took
out against your brother in 2004.

19:03.340 --> 19:05.600
Apparently he pulled a gun on you.

19:05.630 --> 19:06.880
He did.

19:06.910 --> 19:10.830
And yet, according to him, he was with
you the night that your mother disappeared.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.850
In fact, you invited
him to stay over--

19:12.890 --> 19:18.210
the man that pulled a gun on you, the man
that you took a restraing order out against?

19:18.240 --> 19:21.070
It's true. He'd had too much to drink.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.950
I told him to spend the
night in my guest room.

19:23.960 --> 19:29.390
It's also true that there was a period in
my life when I was terrified of my brother.

19:29.770 --> 19:32.770
Thankfully, that's ancient history.

19:34.740 --> 19:38.800
You're not suggesting he's somehow
involved in my mom's disappearance, are you?

19:39.730 --> 19:43.460
Well, from what we know about
them, from what we know about him, 

19:43.470 --> 19:45.360
it's obviously crossed our minds.

19:45.390 --> 19:47.940
I swear to you, he was with me.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.370
The thing you need to
understand, Detective--

19:50.440 --> 19:52.480
the thing you both
need to understand--

19:52.510 --> 19:55.480
is that my brother isn't
the same man he once was.

19:55.490 --> 19:56.840
He's changed.

19:56.880 --> 19:57.880
What do you mean?

19:57.900 --> 20:01.790
Do you rember when we first
met, I mentioned a car accident?

20:03.050 --> 20:05.510
I was in the hospital for over a year.

20:05.520 --> 20:09.770
I had multiple surgeries, 
months of rehab.

20:11.170 --> 20:14.120
Dylan practically took up
residence in my hospital room.

20:14.140 --> 20:16.940
He was with me every step of the way.

20:16.950 --> 20:20.990
In a strange way, my nearly
dying changed everything.

20:21.000 --> 20:25.620
Everything bad between
us just... dissolved.

20:25.630 --> 20:27.030
What about your mom?

20:27.050 --> 20:29.620
What was it like between her and Dylan?

20:29.630 --> 20:32.380
My mother has always
been very hard on Dylan.

20:34.090 --> 20:37.270
At one point, she actually
removed him from the will.

20:38.250 --> 20:42.540
That said, Dylan's really been
trying to mend fences with her.

20:42.970 --> 20:45.490
When Mom had to start
dialysis this past winter, 

20:45.530 --> 20:48.780
he got himself tested to see if
he could donate one of his kidneys.

20:48.790 --> 20:53.510
It wasn't a match, but I think it meant
a lot to her that he'd even be willing.

20:54.880 --> 20:57.730
I'm sorry. I know you're working
very hard to try and find my mother, 

20:57.740 --> 21:02.250
but if you think Dylan had anything
to do with her disappearance...

21:16.060 --> 21:18.070
What are you guys watching?

21:18.110 --> 21:21.350
Aunt Sara says it's called reality TV.

21:21.360 --> 21:23.140
Come on, Al, sit.

21:23.180 --> 21:28.760
Help us decide which one of these attention-starved
wackadoos has the scariest boob job.

21:30.040 --> 21:33.600
No, that's okay. I'm just going to get out
of these clothes, grab something to eat.

21:36.750 --> 21:38.540
Sara...

21:38.560 --> 21:42.100
did, uh, you and Joe have
a chance to, to talk?

21:42.110 --> 21:43.760
Sure did.

21:46.720 --> 21:48.870
Great.

21:55.450 --> 21:57.090
Ariel?

21:57.420 --> 21:58.470
Yeah?

21:58.510 --> 22:00.950
Is this the only place you
could find to do your homework?

22:00.960 --> 22:01.930
Yeah.

22:01.950 --> 22:03.700
Well, what about your bedroom?

22:03.740 --> 22:06.550
Aunt Sara's stuff's all over my desk.

22:06.560 --> 22:07.820
Well, the kitchen?

22:07.850 --> 22:09.410
I can't concentrate.

22:09.430 --> 22:11.850
They're watching some heinous show.

22:11.860 --> 22:14.740
And now that I know that I'm
going to school all day Friday, 

22:14.770 --> 22:17.980
instead of leaving in the middle
of the day to go on a ski trip, 

22:17.990 --> 22:20.750
I have a lot of extra homework to do.

22:22.140 --> 22:24.170
Do you know where your father is?

22:24.200 --> 22:26.950
- In the shower.
- Great.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.780
It's not that she doesn't believe you.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.680
It's not that she doesn't believeinyou.

22:34.690 --> 22:37.350
It turns out, she just
doesn't believe my dad.

22:37.380 --> 22:39.530
She never has, and she never will.

22:39.540 --> 22:42.380
Great. I'm dealing with a ghost
with a credibility problem.

22:42.390 --> 22:47.060
She just kept asking me, "If Ryan's such a decent
guy, "then how come he hasn't shown up here?

22:47.100 --> 22:50.880
"How come he isn't pounding on the
front door, "begging me to come back?

22:50.920 --> 22:52.910
How come he hasn't even called?"

22:53.300 --> 22:56.390
And you know what? I mean, I-I
don't have an answer for that.

22:56.400 --> 22:58.350
Well, maybe you should go see him.

22:58.380 --> 23:01.080
Encourage him to make the first move.

23:01.090 --> 23:02.570
No, I don't want to do that.

23:02.600 --> 23:03.780
This is my sister's marriage.

23:03.820 --> 23:06.990
It would make me really uncomfortable
to get in the middle of all that.

23:07.050 --> 23:10.800
Well, it might be your sister's
marriage, but this is our house.

23:10.840 --> 23:13.640
We got to do something.Ariel's
camped out in the hall, 

23:13.650 --> 23:17.740
and our other children are being
force-fed tofu and reality TV.

23:19.130 --> 23:22.610
All right, I guess I
could drop in on Ryan.

23:36.050 --> 23:37.820
Harmony, you okay?

23:37.840 --> 23:40.160
I don't know. I think so.

23:40.570 --> 23:42.970
I'm almost at the airport.

23:44.910 --> 23:48.780
Are you really sure that I'm not going to
wind up on some security camera or something?

23:48.790 --> 23:50.760
They tape over that
footage all the time.

23:50.780 --> 23:53.750
Nobody's gonna notice the car
there for weeks, believe me.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.000
Everything's gonna be fine, Harmony.

23:56.020 --> 23:57.630
I'm almost done here.
Just do like we said.

23:57.640 --> 24:01.000
Drop off the car, and I'll pick
you up at Terminal Two, all right?

24:01.390 --> 24:03.640
Okay.

24:15.890 --> 24:18.720
****** I'm very worried
about Brooke Hoyt.

24:18.730 --> 24:21.350
- I think she might be...
- Sorry, Allison. It's going to have to wait.

24:21.830 --> 24:23.610
Brooke's mother, Felicia--
they, uh...

24:23.670 --> 24:26.550
They just found her body at
South Mountain Park this morning.

24:26.570 --> 24:28.550
I'm so sorry.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.170
I actually just got off
the phone with Brooke.

24:30.210 --> 24:31.710
I'm meeting her and
Dylan at the city morgue

24:31.740 --> 24:35.860
so that they can make an official
identification of their mother's body.

24:35.880 --> 24:39.020
Did you just say you were
just talking to Brooke?

24:41.410 --> 24:45.700
A park ranger found her at the bottom of
a cliff in a remote area of Pima Canyon.

24:45.730 --> 24:50.080
They figured she slipped and fell during
a walk, but the coroner thinks otherwise.

24:50.110 --> 24:52.030
What do you mean?

24:52.330 --> 24:54.670
There was no blood spatter
where the body landed.

24:55.640 --> 24:58.760
A living person falling from that
height would have popped like a balloon.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.620
Mrs. Hoyt, on the other hand...

25:00.650 --> 25:03.480
What are you telling me? She was already
dead before she went over that cliff?

25:03.490 --> 25:06.000
No. I'm telling you she
was already murdered.

25:06.360 --> 25:09.820
The coroner says she was dead at least
an hour before her body hit those rocks.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.750
That means somebody
took her to that park.

25:11.770 --> 25:14.460
That means somebody
threw her off that cliff.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.220
Probably wanted to make her
death look like an accident

25:17.260 --> 25:20.320
Now, the good news is, they found a few
chunks of skin under Mrs. Hoyt's fingernails, 

25:20.350 --> 25:24.430
which would seem to suggest that
she put up a fight before she died.

25:24.450 --> 25:29.010
With any luck, we'll find out who she
was fighting with once we run that DNA.

25:29.740 --> 25:31.920
You know, it's not
polite to stare, Allison.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.690
I can't help it. I had
another dream last night.

25:34.990 --> 25:38.830
Dylan was burying a body in the
desert, only it wasn't his mother.

25:38.840 --> 25:41.080
It was his sister.

25:41.090 --> 25:43.150
That sister?

25:44.700 --> 25:46.980
I don't know. She
looks pretty spry to me.

25:48.560 --> 25:51.290
Look, Joe, this conversation
is kind of tricky for me.

25:51.320 --> 25:54.150
I mean, you know, we're
talking about your sister here.

25:54.190 --> 25:56.550
And I know you love
her, and I love her, too.

25:56.580 --> 26:00.720
But the truth is, she can be exhausting.

26:00.750 --> 26:02.300
No. Believe me, I know.

26:02.310 --> 26:07.050
Yeah, well, I'm tired of always having
to be the adult in the relationship.

26:07.800 --> 26:10.710
I'm tired of having to clean
up messes I didn't make.

26:10.720 --> 26:13.620
Look, the thing is that I know
that she wants to make it work.

26:13.650 --> 26:15.910
I wouldn't be here if I didn't.

26:15.940 --> 26:17.580
She just needs a little nudge, you know?

26:17.600 --> 26:19.130
A gesture or something.

26:19.170 --> 26:22.630
Maybe if you came by the house to
see her, or if you just called her.

26:22.650 --> 26:26.080
You know, I think that's all that it would
take, really, to get her to come home.

26:26.150 --> 26:29.180
Yeah, I'm sure you're right. I'm-I'm
sure that, if I made the effort, 

26:29.190 --> 26:33.400
Sara would be perfectly willing to forgive
me for the fact that she walked out on me.

26:34.740 --> 26:37.420
Look, I'm-I'm not trying
to be a hard-ass here, 

26:37.450 --> 26:40.760
but she left me, not the
other way around, okay?

26:41.180 --> 26:42.420
Okay.

26:42.450 --> 26:45.130
Would I take her back? Sure.

26:45.760 --> 26:48.250
It's not like I've changed
the locks or anything.

26:48.270 --> 26:50.870
She can come home anytime she wants.

26:50.910 --> 26:55.770
But between you and me, she's put
me through this way too many times.

26:56.510 --> 26:59.070
Your sister digs the drama, Joe.

26:59.080 --> 27:02.340
Me? I'm tired of it.

27:14.020 --> 27:17.110
Sorry. I forgot to get that validated.

27:28.290 --> 27:30.640
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

27:35.240 --> 27:37.830
Well, it didn't look innocent to me.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.960
It didn't look like hand-holding.
More like hand-caressing.

27:40.970 --> 27:42.930
Well, what are you going to do?

27:42.940 --> 27:44.470
I don't know.

27:44.490 --> 27:49.160
I mean, if Ryan really is cheating, then
why would Dad say that he's being faithful?

27:49.650 --> 27:53.000
Why would he want his daughter to go
back to somebody who's betraying her?

27:55.700 --> 27:58.240
I think I got to tell her what I saw.

27:59.290 --> 28:01.170
I'll take her out to dinner
tomorrow night, and, you know, 

28:01.200 --> 28:03.410
get away from the house, 
away from the kids, right?

28:03.420 --> 28:05.810
So she doesn't make a scene.

28:15.620 --> 28:16.800
Hello?

28:16.830 --> 28:21.810
We just got a match on the DNA we
found under Felicia Hoyt's fingernails.

28:21.820 --> 28:25.550
Turns out, it belongs
to Harmony Fletcher.

28:25.560 --> 28:27.950
Harmony, Dylan's old fiancÃ©e?

28:27.960 --> 28:29.150
Yup.

28:29.180 --> 28:34.020
Seems she got arrested for a DUI a while
back, so her prints and DNA were in the system.

28:34.460 --> 28:35.930
It's a perfect match.

28:35.970 --> 28:39.640
Well, I don't understand. I thought
nobody had heard from Harmony in years.

28:39.650 --> 28:41.060
I thought she left the country.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.760
So did everyone else.

28:42.820 --> 28:44.290
Devalos just spoke with Dylan again.

28:44.320 --> 28:47.160
He swears he's had no contact
with her since she left him.

28:47.190 --> 28:50.480
Says he has no idea why
she'd want to kill his mother.

28:51.390 --> 28:54.620
Of course, Mr. Devalos. If Harmony
contacts me, I'll call you right away.

28:54.630 --> 28:56.700
Thank you.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.410
What did he say?

29:01.210 --> 29:04.480
They identified the DNA
they found on Mom's body.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.310
They think it was Harmony Fletcher.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.850
They've launched a
statewide manhunt for her.

29:13.760 --> 29:16.510
That's a good thing, right?

29:16.750 --> 29:20.670
Actually, I'd say
that's better than good.

29:22.730 --> 29:25.510
I'd say that's fantastic.

29:29.320 --> 29:31.950
I told you it was going to be all right.

29:42.460 --> 29:44.650
She didn't do it.

29:44.660 --> 29:48.560
Harmony Fletcher didn't
kill Felicia Hoyt.

29:48.570 --> 29:50.180
Dylan and Brooke did.

29:50.210 --> 29:50.990
Beg your pardon?

29:51.020 --> 29:54.400
Look, I'm sorry; I know that
Felicia was your friend.

29:54.430 --> 29:58.180
But I'm telling you, something
peculiar is going on with her children.

29:58.190 --> 30:02.930
Last night... I saw them kissing.

30:03.350 --> 30:06.370
On the lips. For a very long time.

30:07.330 --> 30:09.240
I think that they're lovers.

30:09.260 --> 30:11.590
When you say yousaw, you...

30:11.620 --> 30:13.540
Okay, I didn't see it. I dreamt it.

30:13.550 --> 30:18.320
But what if it is true? What if Felicia
found out? What if she confronted them?

30:18.330 --> 30:23.000
Look, I know that the DNA is telling
us that Harmony killed Felicia, 

30:23.010 --> 30:28.540
but what if Dylan and Brooke figured out a way to
plant it there so that we would think it was Harmony?

30:28.550 --> 30:30.610
Allison, it's not just the DNA.

30:30.630 --> 30:33.760
Harmony Fletcher confessed
to Felicia's murder.

30:33.770 --> 30:35.430
What do you mean? You found her?

30:35.440 --> 30:36.930
Well, not exactly.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.850
Dylan Hoyt found this on
his doorstep this morning.

30:39.870 --> 30:41.970
It's from Harmony, 
confessing to everything.

30:42.010 --> 30:44.620
Harmony Fletcher didn't leave Dylan
at the altar 'cause of cold feet.

30:44.640 --> 30:46.870
She left him 'cause of cold cash.

30:46.900 --> 30:49.290
Apparently, Felicia Hoyt didn't
approve of Dylan's fiancÃ©e, 

30:49.300 --> 30:52.370
so she offered her
$100, 000 to leave town.

30:53.110 --> 30:56.580
Harmony took it and never looked
back, at least until four days ago.

30:56.620 --> 30:58.240
She'd run out of money.

30:58.270 --> 31:01.280
When Felicia refused to give her
another cent, things got heated.

31:01.290 --> 31:03.690
Harmony hit her over the head
with a crystal paperweight.

31:03.720 --> 31:07.320
When she realized she'd killed her, 
she dressed Felicia in hiking clothes, 

31:07.350 --> 31:10.780
drove her car to South Mountain Park, 
pitched her body over that cliff.

31:10.790 --> 31:13.910
This doesn't make any sense. Why
would she leave this note for Dylan?

31:13.920 --> 31:18.030
And if she did everything that this letter
claims that she did, where is she now?

31:18.040 --> 31:19.180
I think this is a fake.

31:19.210 --> 31:20.380
No, it's real, Allison.

31:20.410 --> 31:24.770
We compared that signature to the one on her
release papers from her DUI arrest a few years back.

31:24.780 --> 31:26.110
It's a perfect match.

31:26.130 --> 31:30.260
What's more, Harmony's fingerprints are all over
that paper, and according to preliminary DNA tests, 

31:30.270 --> 31:33.350
her saliva sealed the
envelope it came in.

31:38.560 --> 31:40.420
Rough day, Ally?

31:40.450 --> 31:42.520
Yeah, as a matter of fact, it was.

31:42.550 --> 31:45.280
It was a rough night, too, 
now that you mention it.

31:45.760 --> 31:48.470
You want to know why, or are you
already ahead of me on that one?

31:48.490 --> 31:50.280
Well, if you're referring
to the fact that

31:50.300 --> 31:56.130
Sara's husband appears to be giving more than
just dictation to his comely young assistant, 

31:56.140 --> 31:59.180
yeah, I guess I'm ahead of you.

31:59.190 --> 32:01.670
Truth be told, I've been
ahead of you all along.

32:01.690 --> 32:02.850
But you got to understand, Ally.

32:02.860 --> 32:05.960
There's a reason that I
haven't been truthful with you.

32:05.970 --> 32:08.410
Sara's pregnant?

32:08.420 --> 32:11.650
Your dad said she's three weeks
along. She doesn't even know yet.

32:12.650 --> 32:15.140
I hate this. So now what? What am I...

32:15.480 --> 32:19.190
I'm just about to take her out to dinner and
tell her that her husband is a cheating bastard.

32:19.210 --> 32:21.660
I have no idea what
I'm supposed to do now.

32:21.690 --> 32:24.770
Your dad really doesn't
want you to have that dinner.

32:24.780 --> 32:28.370
He-He swears that once Sara
learns that she's pregnant, 

32:28.410 --> 32:31.540
once she and Ryan realize
they're going to be parents, 

32:31.580 --> 32:33.990
that'll go a long way
to fixing their marriage.

32:34.030 --> 32:36.160
That he'll end the affair.

32:36.180 --> 32:39.080
He says... Your dad says
they'll actually be happy.

32:39.090 --> 32:40.530
So he doesn't want me to tell her?

32:40.570 --> 32:44.090
Your father's absolutely convinced that if
Sara finds out that Ryan's been cheating on her, 

32:44.110 --> 32:46.050
they'll be a big blowup.

32:46.070 --> 32:47.600
That-That'll be it for them.

32:47.620 --> 32:51.700
They'll do the kind of damage that
can't be undone, baby or no baby.

32:51.730 --> 32:53.920
That's why your father lied to me.

32:53.950 --> 32:57.280
And that's why you can't tell Sara
that Ryan's been cheating on her.

32:57.290 --> 32:59.060
Okay.

33:00.340 --> 33:04.180
Wait, where are you going? You're not
going to say anything to her, are you?

33:04.890 --> 33:07.580
Well, I gotta tell her that
we're not going to dinner.

33:07.610 --> 33:09.320
And the rest of it...

33:09.350 --> 33:11.460
I gotta sleep on it.

33:13.880 --> 33:17.760
Are you really sure that I'm not going to
wind up on some security camera or something?

33:18.070 --> 33:19.870
They tape over that
footage all the time.

33:19.900 --> 33:22.840
Nobody's even going to notice the
car there for weeks. Believe me.

33:22.850 --> 33:25.890
Harmony, it's all going to be
okay, all right? I'm almost done here.

33:26.160 --> 33:29.550
Just do like we said: dump the car, and
I'll pick you up at Terminal Two, all right?

33:30.160 --> 33:32.360
Okay.

33:38.700 --> 33:41.400
We're just a few weeks away
from the midterm elections, 

33:41.410 --> 33:44.780
and polling data indicates
that the incumbent Republicans

33:44.790 --> 33:48.550
will be lucky to escape
2006 with their...

33:58.620 --> 34:01.480
What's going on? You okay?

34:02.360 --> 34:04.650
It's nothing. Just a bad dream.

34:04.660 --> 34:06.980
You need to call anyone?

34:06.990 --> 34:10.620
No, it was something that
happened back in 2006.

34:10.630 --> 34:13.449
There's nothing we can do about it now.

34:22.090 --> 34:24.130
I think she's waking up.

34:25.350 --> 34:26.840
Well, hello there.

34:26.860 --> 34:29.230
It's nice to have you back.

34:29.690 --> 34:31.889
You've been unconscious for some time.

34:31.909 --> 34:34.570
You were in a terrible accident.

34:34.980 --> 34:38.909
Now, don't try to speak. We
had to wire your jaw shut.

34:39.270 --> 34:43.659
Now, I'm afraid your internal
injuries are quite serious, 

34:43.679 --> 34:46.900
and your facial tissue has been
through some serious trauma.

34:46.909 --> 34:48.699
You nearly lost all
the skin on your face, 

34:48.710 --> 34:51.360
and some of the underlying
bone was compromised as well.

34:51.400 --> 34:54.159
But it's going to be okay.
Tell her it's going to be okay.

34:54.170 --> 34:55.850
A team of plastic surgeons is flying in.

34:55.880 --> 34:58.470
They're going to work from
old photographs of you.

34:58.710 --> 35:02.690
It's going to take some time and a number
of operations, but the good news is...

35:02.710 --> 35:06.850
we believe, eventually, you will
look just like your old self.

35:07.420 --> 35:12.780
Now... we have a long road ahead
of us, Brooke. You should rest.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.700
Please, don't try to speak.

35:15.720 --> 35:17.860
Doctor, can I have a
moment with my sister?

35:17.870 --> 35:19.920
Of course.

35:24.460 --> 35:26.740
All right, Harmony, listen to me.
They found you in Brooke's car.

35:26.750 --> 35:29.300
They think you're Brooke.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.420
You know my mom loves Brooke.

35:33.460 --> 35:36.510
If you were Brooke, we'd have
all the money we'd ever need.

35:36.520 --> 35:40.720
I mean, all this-- the accident, 
the operations they want to do--

35:41.360 --> 35:44.150
it kind of feels like fate, doesn't it?

35:48.220 --> 35:49.830
Sorry it's so hot in here.

35:49.860 --> 35:52.310
The air-conditioning has been
temperamental the last couple days.

35:52.320 --> 35:54.840
I think it may have finally
given out altogether.

35:54.860 --> 35:56.430
Let me know if you want more.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.170
Not to worry.

35:58.200 --> 36:02.190
So, why are we here? Where is
Dylan? Does he know about this?

36:02.440 --> 36:04.110
Actually, no.

36:04.140 --> 36:08.510
Given his history of involvement with
everyone, we wanted to talk to you first.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.610
We've found Harmony Fletcher.

36:14.370 --> 36:18.960
And what's more, we're virtually certain
that we can prove that she's responsible--

36:18.990 --> 36:22.490
at least in part-- for
the murder of Felicia Hoyt.

36:22.500 --> 36:26.260
You're joking? Where was she?

36:27.100 --> 36:29.360
How did you ever find her?

36:29.380 --> 36:31.340
We didn't have to look very hard.

36:31.360 --> 36:34.060
We know exactly what you did, Harmony.

36:36.870 --> 36:39.260
Were you... were you just talking to me?

36:41.340 --> 36:44.210
- That's crazy.
- We know all about the accident.

36:44.470 --> 36:47.260
All about the reconstructive surgeries.

36:47.810 --> 36:50.240
We know who you really are, Harmony.

36:50.270 --> 36:52.420
You're serious?

36:52.430 --> 36:54.650
It's a hell of a story.

36:55.770 --> 36:58.340
Lucky for us, we can prove it.

36:58.370 --> 36:59.640
What's he doing?

36:59.660 --> 37:02.590
Your fingerprints are on that
glass. DNA from your lips, too.

37:03.020 --> 37:05.600
And I'm fairly certain
that when we test them, 

37:05.620 --> 37:08.620
they're going to come back a perfect
match for Harmony Fletcher. Am I wrong?

37:08.630 --> 37:11.970
We know that Dylan killed the
real Brooke three years ago.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.830
They got in a fight about
money. Things got out of hand.

37:14.840 --> 37:18.040
The two of you conspired
to get rid of the body.

37:18.050 --> 37:22.220
The DNA evidence tells us
that you killed Felicia Hoyt.

37:22.900 --> 37:26.730
The one thing we don't know is... why.

37:27.070 --> 37:31.040
And if you're willing to testify about
Dylan's complicity about both these murders, 

37:31.070 --> 37:34.400
I'll just think about taking
the death penalty off the table.

37:35.770 --> 37:38.020
Please, feel free to exercise
your right to remain silent, 

37:38.050 --> 37:40.910
but you should know that I'm
offering the same deal to Dylan, 

37:40.920 --> 37:45.620
so you'll need to decide rather quickly
whether or not you believe your "brother"

37:45.660 --> 37:49.170
will keep quiet if
his life's on the line.

37:53.160 --> 37:56.360
I had to kill Felicia
because of her kidneys.

37:57.120 --> 38:01.890
She need a transplant. She kept pressing me to
get tested to see if I was a compatible donor.

38:02.460 --> 38:04.440
Of course, I couldn't do that.

38:04.460 --> 38:07.730
The test would prove in an instant
that I wasn't really her daughter.

38:08.730 --> 38:11.640
She didn't understand
why I wouldn't help her.

38:11.650 --> 38:14.590
How could her only
daughter just let her die?

38:15.680 --> 38:18.990
It got nasty between us.
She threatened to cut me off.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.810
And you couldn't let that happen.

38:23.380 --> 38:27.580
Harmony Fletcher, you're under
arrest for the murder of Felicia Hoyt.

38:27.590 --> 38:32.180
You have the right to remain silent; anything you say
can and will be used against you in a court of law.

38:33.180 --> 38:35.140
Yeah?

38:37.970 --> 38:41.160
How goes the hunt for
a new place to live?

38:43.720 --> 38:45.930
that's encouraging.

38:45.950 --> 38:49.450
If I, uh, tell you something...

38:50.870 --> 38:52.580
promise not to roll your eyes?

38:52.590 --> 38:54.170
I don't roll my eyes.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.050
You've been rolling
your eyes my whole life.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.980
Well, maybe you should have said something
sooner, 'cause I honestly have no idea that I'm doing it.

39:02.890 --> 39:05.280
I miss my husband.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.100
There, you just did it again.

39:07.110 --> 39:10.310
- Sara...
- I know. It sounds crazy, right?

39:10.320 --> 39:11.000
What... what are you saying?

39:11.010 --> 39:12.790
You saying you suddenly
changed your mind?

39:12.810 --> 39:14.190
You saying you think that he's innocent?

39:14.200 --> 39:17.450
Because, if you do, there's something
that I... I got to tell you.

39:17.460 --> 39:19.730
There's nothing you need to tell me.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.270
I know he's having an affair.

39:22.280 --> 39:25.600
Even have a pretty good
idea who he's having it with.

39:26.760 --> 39:28.970
But I miss him, and I want to go home.

39:28.990 --> 39:30.930
- Well, hold on, just wait a second.
- I don't want to hold on a second.

39:30.940 --> 39:33.520
That's what I want to do.

39:33.530 --> 39:34.970
If he'll have me.

39:34.990 --> 39:36.400
If he'll haveyou?

39:36.430 --> 39:38.990
Get ready to roll those eyes again.

39:40.770 --> 39:43.260
- I cheated on him first, Joe.
- What?

39:43.270 --> 39:47.120
I cheated on him
first. About a year ago.

39:47.390 --> 39:51.890
Last summer. It was at the beach club
during the week, while Ryan was at work.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.610
I never drink during the week, 
and I never drink without Ryan.

39:55.620 --> 39:58.990
But it started to rain, and
there was nothing else to do, 

39:59.010 --> 40:03.320
and this nice-looking
guy bought me a drink.

40:03.330 --> 40:06.140
Didn't even ask. Just sent it over.

40:06.790 --> 40:10.150
I kind of convinced myself it
was all a big drunken nightmare.

40:11.180 --> 40:14.160
But then, the guy started texting me.

40:14.570 --> 40:17.560
I didn't answer his texts.
I didn't even encourage him.

40:18.410 --> 40:21.080
But Ryan saw one.

40:22.990 --> 40:25.300
Well, say something.

40:29.730 --> 40:32.620
Well, anyway, I'm...

40:33.080 --> 40:36.870
heading home tomorrow morning.

40:38.450 --> 40:41.220
Hopefully, he hasn't changed the locks.

40:42.990 --> 40:45.860
Who knows? Maybe a miracle will happen.

40:46.410 --> 40:49.230
Maybe he'll find a
reason to love me again.

40:50.010 --> 40:56.260
Well, for what it's worth, I have it on pretty
good authority that your key will still let you in.

40:56.870 --> 41:01.120
And believe it or not, 
being married to Allison, 

41:01.130 --> 41:05.070
I'm learning to buy into this
miracle thing more and more.

41:05.450 --> 41:08.410
It's quite a family
you've married into, huh?

41:08.780 --> 41:11.770
Dad's a liar, sister's a cheater.

41:11.790 --> 41:16.230
I'm starting to think maybe my mom
kills drifters in her spare time.

41:17.730 --> 41:22.770
Well, at least she's home again, 
and there's peace for now.

41:22.780 --> 41:25.430
Ariel? Honey, your room's ready!

41:25.440 --> 41:28.150
Hey, you know what? I get to be an uncle.

41:28.450 --> 41:32.810
I mean, if everything that my dad says
is right, I'm going to be an uncle.

41:32.830 --> 41:35.400
- Congratulations, Unc!
- Thank you.

41:35.410 --> 41:38.250
Ariel, you can have your room back!

41:38.270 --> 41:40.820
- I guess I'll be an aunt.
- That's right.

41:40.830 --> 41:42.590
What's all the hollering about?

41:42.620 --> 41:45.770
Honey, can you go tell your sister
in the kitchen that her room's ready?

41:45.780 --> 41:47.400
What are you talking about?

41:47.430 --> 41:49.280
Ariel isn't in the kitchen.

41:49.300 --> 41:51.270
She's not even home from school yet.

41:52.020 --> 41:54.100
What... what are you talking
about? It's after 5:00.

41:54.110 --> 41:57.220
Okay. But she's still
not home from school.

41:57.230 --> 42:01.600
You know, it's Friday. I bet she left
school and went on that ski trip.

42:01.610 --> 42:04.830
- Ariel?
- I have Ashley's number in the kitchen.
