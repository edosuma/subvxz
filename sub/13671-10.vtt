00:01.200 --> 00:02.240
Previously...

00:02.240 --> 00:03.600
Donald, this'll be a big mess.

00:03.600 --> 00:06.280
People are already at the hospital
are talking about this.

00:06.280 --> 00:08.320
Dad's happier since
you two started going out.

00:08.320 --> 00:10.280
Where do you guys go?

00:10.280 --> 00:13.000
You never spend a night together
at our place,

00:13.000 --> 00:15.520
and living with your mom,
your place is out of the question.

00:15.520 --> 00:17.800
I used to be one of the saltiest
cardiac surgeons in the State,

00:17.800 --> 00:20.720
then I lost my temper
and shattered a picture.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.640
Foolish. Now I'm paying the price.

00:22.640 --> 00:25.280
Sidney!

00:25.280 --> 00:27.240
Wayne.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.280
You killed him!

00:28.280 --> 00:29.680
I'll operate.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.080
What?  We have no choice.

00:31.080 --> 00:32.800
I'll just have to dive in.

00:32.800 --> 00:36.800
Clear.

02:09.680 --> 02:13.680
You awake?  Mm.

02:15.520 --> 02:19.520
I can't help thinking about
what happened to Fiscus.

02:19.800 --> 02:22.680
I know the shooting wasn't my fault,
but...

02:22.680 --> 02:26.680
why can't I stop
feeling that way?

02:27.960 --> 02:31.640
Because you expect the best

02:31.640 --> 02:34.120
from the people
who work for you.

02:34.120 --> 02:38.040
And in return, you care about them
so much.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.440
Well, at least
it's quiet now.

02:40.440 --> 02:43.400
I don't know what those people
were doing in the next room.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.680
I just hope they didn't
hurt each other!

02:46.680 --> 02:48.160
You all right?

02:48.160 --> 02:52.160
Mm-hm.

02:52.880 --> 02:56.560
Not the same, is it?

02:56.560 --> 03:00.080
BEEPING

03:00.080 --> 03:04.080
It's mine.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.400
This is Dr Novino.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.480
They beep me, then they put me
on hold.

03:12.480 --> 03:14.400
Sorry. What were
you saying?

03:14.400 --> 03:16.120
I was just thinking.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.800
Yes?

03:18.800 --> 03:21.200
How long?

03:21.200 --> 03:25.200
Um, try some percussion
and postural drainage,

03:26.200 --> 03:29.920
and I'll be right there.

03:29.920 --> 03:33.160
A 12-year-old with CF.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.600
I'm sorry, Donald.
Go ahead.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.480
I was just thinking about
our first time here.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.360
Doctor of the Year awards dinner.
It's not the same, is it?

03:41.360 --> 03:43.040
The hotel's gone downhill.

03:43.040 --> 03:44.720
No, I mean about us.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.280
We just seem to be going
through the motions.

03:48.280 --> 03:52.280
Well, got to go.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.400
Maybe coming here
has lost its magic.

We'll come back later.

04:29.480 --> 04:31.800
Dr Craig, may I say once more
how inspiring it was

04:31.800 --> 04:33.520
to operate beside you last night.

04:33.520 --> 04:34.600
Morrison?

04:34.600 --> 04:35.920
Next case.

04:35.920 --> 04:38.800
Dr Craig.

04:38.800 --> 04:41.200
I was scheduled
to lead the rounds.

04:41.200 --> 04:44.080
Since you were late, we
started without you. Morrison?

04:44.080 --> 04:45.520
I'll take over now.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.400
Dr Kiem, you did
a wonderful job

04:47.400 --> 04:50.240
as Acting Chief
of Surgery.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.440
Now I'm back.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.040
Because you
saved Fiscus?

04:53.040 --> 04:55.640
You're welcome
to tag along.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.520
No, thank you.

04:57.520 --> 05:00.400
Fine. And I'd like to get back
in my old office

05:00.400 --> 05:01.800

05:01.800 --> 05:05.040

not too much trouble.

enough oxygen reached his brain.

05:22.920 --> 05:26.120
Mark did a terrific job.

Just a cold.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.800
What about
Wayne's family?

05:36.800 --> 05:40.680
His father's on his way up
from Washington Heights.

05:40.680 --> 05:43.560
Daniel, I've decided
I want to split my job.

05:43.560 --> 05:45.960
I'd like you
to find someone

05:45.960 --> 05:47.880
to head up Medical Education.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.120
I'll remain Director of Medicine.

05:50.120 --> 05:52.760
Give me a little more time
to work with the patients.

05:52.760 --> 05:54.040
&lt; OK.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.880
Oh, by the way,
happy anniversary.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.000

I just hope
this young man is alive

06:00.360 --> 06:04.360
to celebrate your 41st.

06:12.200 --> 06:16.200
Katharine and I began our courtship
in these halls...

06:16.640 --> 06:19.360
and linen closets.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.920
1945. She was a volunteer.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.840
I was fresh out of
the South Pacific.

06:24.840 --> 06:27.520
Smitten the moment
I laid eyes on her.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.200
All those years together.
Terrific.

06:30.200 --> 06:32.280
I've only known
Carol a few months...

06:32.280 --> 06:34.440
Nuptials in the offing?

06:34.440 --> 06:37.640
No, I'm afraid our relationship
is losing steam.

06:37.640 --> 06:39.280
Maybe a change
of scenery, huh?

06:39.280 --> 06:40.720
Take the weekend.

06:40.720 --> 06:42.880
I know a lovely inn
in Middlebury.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.600
Always puts us
back on our pins.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.760
The problem's closer to home.

06:47.760 --> 06:50.240
Carol's only been to my house
for dinner,

06:50.240 --> 06:51.640
not the night.

06:51.640 --> 06:53.040
Ah, now I understand.

06:53.040 --> 06:56.800
I don't feel right about bringing
Carol into Maureen's bed.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.080
We bought it when we were
first married.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.920
Started our family there.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.840
She nursed Tommy and Lizzie there.

07:02.840 --> 07:06.640

doesn't it?

I just can't get rid
of the memories, Daniel.

07:13.080 --> 07:17.080
Keep the memories.
Get rid of the bed.

Yo! Loose set-screw.
Cinched her down.

until it's too late.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.000
"Routine maintenance
is man's only weapon
against entropy."

07:42.760 --> 07:44.960

left Napoli,

grandpa was a Bovino - cow.

Excuse me?

Keep the pen.

were different colours.

brother's son.

Ischia's grocery?

That's my uncle and aunt's.
We're North Street.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.000
We lived on Hull.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.400
My cousins, the Penarellis,
live on Hull.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.960
You're Anna Penarelli's cousin?

08:13.960 --> 08:15.480
Yeah!  Good kid.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.520
I haven't been around
for a while.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.920
Dad hauled us out
to the 'burbs in the '60s.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.160
North End was decaying.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.840
North End was decaying.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.240
Yuppies moved in,
driving prices up.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.280
Normal socioeconomic
change.

08:27.280 --> 08:29.560
My dad likes
to quote Heraclitus.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.920
"All is flux.
Nothing stands still."

08:31.920 --> 08:34.159
Well, neither should I.

you're in here for.

(Ahem.)

08:41.360 --> 08:43.840
Prosthetic placement.

08:43.840 --> 08:46.280
Found out I had
the big C last year.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.800
Dr Barton removed my bladder.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.840
The erectile nerves
to the penis were severed,

08:49.840 --> 08:51.880
rendering me impotent.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.160
Now I'm back for
a penile implant.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.600
Erections will be
artificial,

08:56.600 --> 08:58.320
but my wife and I can have sex
by the numbers again.

this with you?

that he be left alone for prayer.

What's that?

11:07.080 --> 11:09.480
The kosher meal he ordered.

what landed the man

I told him, but this is the food
he wants.

a speedier recovery

are going to open up,

13:52.120 --> 13:55.200
We all face that
knowledge, you know,

13:55.200 --> 13:58.200
but we keep going.

13:58.200 --> 14:02.200
How?

14:06.840 --> 14:09.760
Please...

14:09.760 --> 14:13.760
Leave me alone.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.160
Helen.

14:22.160 --> 14:25.080
Mark and I are agreed - we want
to move Fiscus out of the ICU

14:25.080 --> 14:27.000
and into a regular room.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.440
I think he'll bounce back faster

14:28.440 --> 14:31.360
if he's not being treated
as a critical patient.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.240
By the way,
I'll be out this afternoon.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.000
Another medical conference?

14:35.000 --> 14:36.320
Another medical conference?

14:36.320 --> 14:40.320
TANNOY ANOUNCEMENTS

14:41.160 --> 14:42.360
Daniel?

14:42.360 --> 14:44.760
Why'd the Braves
ever leave Boston?

14:44.760 --> 14:48.760
How should I know?
I want to talk with you.

14:52.760 --> 14:55.160
About that spouse of yours.

14:55.160 --> 14:58.520
There's a liver that's not long
for this world.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.600
Mine.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.560
Oh.

15:01.560 --> 15:03.560
Well, it's not
really my field.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.760
The cancer's neither
advanced nor retreated.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.760
What about Katharine?

15:08.760 --> 15:10.880
Well, I have
an Orthodox rabbi in

15:10.880 --> 15:13.000
for acute hypertension.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.400
Katharine is helping him
commit ritual suicide

15:15.400 --> 15:17.480
on kosher corned beef.

15:17.480 --> 15:20.560
Orthodox law
is hardly her fault.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.280
Katharine is helpful.
She's concerned.

15:23.280 --> 15:25.680
And in the way.
Doctors ran St Eligius,

15:25.680 --> 15:28.080
but she and
her merry volunteers

15:28.080 --> 15:31.160
are turning this hospital
into a cruise ship.

15:31.160 --> 15:34.000
Before you know it,
we'll be having costume night.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.880
Volunteerism is the cornerstone
of American philanthropy.

15:37.880 --> 15:40.720
Don't hand me reheated
Reagan, Daniel.

15:40.720 --> 15:44.080
You won't say anything
because she's your wife.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.040
Katharine has spent
countless hours

15:46.040 --> 15:48.000
organizing the
auxiliary's activities.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.480
Teas, luncheons, award dinners -
no problems.

15:51.480 --> 15:55.480
Just tell her to keep her butt
out of my patient's treatment.

16:11.440 --> 16:13.560
Mr Bevine, Dr Novino,
you're both here.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.480
Practising.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.200
Mr Bevine has chosen
to treat his impotence

16:18.200 --> 16:20.600
with the inflatable
penile prosthesis.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.560
His other option would
be the more common,

16:23.560 --> 16:26.640
less expensive,
semi-rigid implant,

16:26.640 --> 16:28.840
which is flexible
and can be bent

16:28.840 --> 16:30.600
into position
like a gooseneck lamp.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.000
Even though the inflatable
is costly and can break down,

16:34.000 --> 16:36.920
it more closely duplicates
a natural erection.

16:36.920 --> 16:40.920
I'll make a small incision
near the base of the penis.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.880
The entire apparatus is implanted
through the one opening.

16:43.880 --> 16:45.600
Any questions?

16:45.600 --> 16:47.120
Seems pretty straight ahead.

16:47.120 --> 16:49.600
Good. Then I'll see you
both in surgery.

16:49.600 --> 16:51.160
Oh, Carol,

16:51.160 --> 16:54.080
the next time you're out
with Dr Westphall,

16:54.080 --> 16:56.440
put in a good word
for urology.

16:56.440 --> 16:59.640
We should have
a lithotripter.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.040
Donald Westphall.

17:01.040 --> 17:04.400
Moved him back into his house
a year ago.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.839
Stuffer, not a packer.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.760
You two are an item?

17:07.760 --> 17:09.680
We're a headline
around here.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.119
Jeez, love in the workplace.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.400
Perilous. Destroyed two
of my best moving men.

17:14.400 --> 17:15.760
In love with the same woman?

17:15.760 --> 17:19.760
Each other.

17:21.319 --> 17:24.359
I'm anxious to get my pay cheque -
it always depresses me.

17:24.359 --> 17:26.880
Never enough, especially
with my new family.

17:26.880 --> 17:30.080
Boomer, how can you feed three more
on our salary?

17:30.080 --> 17:33.040
With Robert gone, alone,
I can barely make ends meet.

17:33.040 --> 17:37.040
Got to get my pay cheque in the bank
before my balance hits the minimum.

17:43.360 --> 17:46.120
And we're worried
about money.

17:46.120 --> 17:49.400
Poor Wayne - he never hurt anything.

17:49.400 --> 17:52.480
Last night, Wayne was
catching fireflies

17:52.480 --> 17:54.480
like a kid
filled with energy.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.400
The woman who shot him
should be punished.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.840
What can we do for him?

17:58.840 --> 18:02.840
Wayne's always meant
so much to me.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.120
Coming, Boomer?

18:06.120 --> 18:10.120
No, I'm gonna go back up.
Gonna see how Wayne's doing.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.800
Wayne's been
my best friend.

18:23.800 --> 18:25.200
I love the guy.

18:25.200 --> 18:27.160
Me, too.

18:27.160 --> 18:30.520
Hey, subtraction
was off! I'm way above

18:30.520 --> 18:34.520
my minimum bank balance
of ¤5,000.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.400
What's all this?

18:39.400 --> 18:40.840
My medical texts.

18:40.840 --> 18:42.800
I thought everything was stolen
along with your manuscript.

18:42.800 --> 18:44.720
Lucky for me, these were
in the basement.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.280
But I'm putting that chapter
behind me

18:47.280 --> 18:49.800
with the 18
John Doe pirated.

18:49.800 --> 18:52.040
Forget him...

18:52.040 --> 18:56.040
and Paulette Kiem.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.720
Thank you.

19:00.720 --> 19:02.680
Why aren't you packed?

19:02.680 --> 19:06.040
We got the embassy personnel
out of Saigon in less time.

19:06.040 --> 19:08.200
I'm doing the job
I was hired to do.

19:08.200 --> 19:11.280
You were hired to replace me -
temporarily.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.280
I have a contract.

19:12.280 --> 19:16.280
I have a contract.

19:16.520 --> 19:18.840
Should I simply clear out,

19:18.840 --> 19:21.080
leave my patients and take
the shuttle back to Washington?

19:21.080 --> 19:24.080
I don't care if you go by sampan.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.760
You just can't walk in screaming
and expect me to jump.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.240
I am  not  your servant.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.720
I'm supposed to kowtow

19:30.720 --> 19:33.480
because you won everybody over
with some "Confucius say"?

19:33.480 --> 19:36.480
Not me, lady. This is my side
of the street.

19:36.480 --> 19:39.120
Too bad. I'll go
when I'm ready.

19:39.120 --> 19:43.040
Oh, you'll be ready.

19:43.040 --> 19:47.040
So fast, it'll make
your kimono spin.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.320
This is a really good one.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.720
OK, so this guy -
Bob Smith -

19:53.720 --> 19:56.560
or any name you want.

19:56.560 --> 20:00.160
It doesn't really matter.
He's got these terrible headaches,

20:00.160 --> 20:04.160
and, uh...um...

20:07.440 --> 20:09.680
I'm here to see
my son, Wayne Fiscus.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.120
Mr Fiscus! I'm Elliot Axelrod.
I'm Wayne's friend.

20:11.120 --> 20:12.560
Mr Fiscus! I'm Elliot Axelrod.
I'm Wayne's friend.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.920
Stable. Let me show you
to his room.

20:14.920 --> 20:18.760
On the way in the car, I start to
worry - what if I'm too late
and Wayne was dead.

20:18.760 --> 20:21.960
No-one has stopped to waste time
to call in case he's not.

20:21.960 --> 20:25.960
This way.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.000
After all that,

20:28.000 --> 20:30.920
the doctor says,
"Bob," or whatever,

20:30.920 --> 20:34.920
"I'm not sure what's
causing the headaches,

20:35.280 --> 20:38.560
"but I know it will stop
if I do this one operation."

20:38.560 --> 20:41.120
(LAUGHS)

20:41.120 --> 20:43.320
I mean, it's not true.

20:43.320 --> 20:47.320
Obviously. Um, and so
the guy, Bob...

20:48.920 --> 20:51.280
I'm surprised Wayne's
never mentioned me.

20:51.280 --> 20:52.720
I don't understand.

20:52.720 --> 20:54.400
What kind of place is this

20:54.400 --> 20:57.040
that something
like this could happen?

20:57.040 --> 20:58.200
BEEPING

20:58.200 --> 20:59.600
Oh, no.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.200
Victor, do you mind showing
Mr Fiscus to Wayne's room?

21:02.200 --> 21:03.280
My pleasure.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.480
Hi, Jonas. Victor Ehrlich.
Sorry to meet you like this.

21:06.480 --> 21:08.600
We spoke on the phone
when Wayne roomed with me.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.520
How's the carpet business?

21:09.520 --> 21:11.200
How's the carpet business?

21:11.200 --> 21:13.040
We squeezed blood through
his body for an hour.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.120
I held your son's heart
in my hand.

21:15.120 --> 21:19.120
It's a miracle he's alive.

21:19.280 --> 21:21.200
I can't help it.

21:21.200 --> 21:25.200
Anyways, uh...Bob's
moping around the house,

21:25.600 --> 21:28.360
and his wife, Susan...
No, Jane.

21:28.360 --> 21:30.680
Right, Jane. Anyways,
um... Oh, yeah.

21:30.680 --> 21:33.400
She says, "Honey..."
I mean... (RAISES PITCH)

21:33.400 --> 21:35.840
"Honey, I know how you must feel,

21:35.840 --> 21:37.080
"and whenever I'm depressed,

21:37.080 --> 21:41.080
"what I do is go buy clothes."

21:42.640 --> 21:44.000
I thought this was the room.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.760
Jackie, do you know
where Wayne is?

21:45.760 --> 21:46.920
East wing.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.320
Oh. I've got
a post-op consult.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.560
Do you mind showing
Mr Fiscus?

21:50.560 --> 21:52.000
Oh, no problem.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.120
Thanks. Bye.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.520
It's this way.

21:54.520 --> 21:57.440
I think your son's
the best doctor in our group.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.560
He's always there for me.

21:59.560 --> 22:03.560
So, uh...Bob has
a whole suit made.

22:04.160 --> 22:07.320
And he does.
He feels better.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.600
Here comes the good part...

22:09.600 --> 22:12.240
Oh, my God.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.360
Jack, come here.

22:13.360 --> 22:17.360
Let's leave them alone.

22:29.240 --> 22:32.120
May I see the implant?

22:32.120 --> 22:33.720
Why's Mr Bevine going
to such lengths?

22:33.720 --> 22:37.200
Why's Mr Bevine going
to such lengths?

22:37.200 --> 22:40.000
I meant he's risking a lot.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.840
Pain, infection...

22:41.840 --> 22:44.680
..40-50% breakdown rate,

22:44.680 --> 22:47.360
not to mention possible
surgical complications.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.480
All for sex.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.080
Still can't have children.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.800
Sex is a powerful
motivator.

22:53.800 --> 22:55.240
I know that.

22:55.240 --> 22:59.240
And in Mr Bevine's case,
so is love.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.520
Since his operation
for bladder cancer,

23:02.520 --> 23:06.520
I've seen both Mr Bevine
and his wife for counselling.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.600
From the start, however,
Mr Bevine wanted to ensure

23:10.600 --> 23:14.600
normal sexual pleasure
for his wife.

23:16.280 --> 23:18.440
Yes, there are risks,

23:18.440 --> 23:22.400
but he's willing to make
the sacrifice for her.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.720
Wouldn't you be?

23:24.720 --> 23:28.720
Mrs Bevine thinks her husband's
out of town on business.

23:28.800 --> 23:31.280
So this is going to be a surprise.

23:31.280 --> 23:35.280
I'm ready to make
the incision. Scalpel.

23:39.720 --> 23:41.200
Oh, hello, dear.

23:41.200 --> 23:44.320
I had Jesus help me bring
two meals up here.

23:44.320 --> 23:47.000
Thought we might enjoy a little
anniversary lunch.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.120
Haven't done this
since the old days.

23:49.120 --> 23:51.760
You always made me
keep the door open.

23:51.760 --> 23:55.760
Young auxiliary women weren't
supposed to be locked up

23:55.760 --> 23:58.240
with young doctors
just back from the war.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.440
We found our ways.

23:59.440 --> 24:00.560
Oh!

24:00.560 --> 24:02.320
I hope you don't mind
the salade supreme.

24:02.320 --> 24:06.320
I removed the parsley garnish
because I know you hate it so.

24:06.640 --> 24:07.720
Salade supreme.

24:07.720 --> 24:10.440
Such a noble name
for day-old vegetables.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.400
There's your napkin,
Daniel.

24:12.400 --> 24:15.880
Now, isn't this lovely?

24:15.880 --> 24:17.640
Oh, yes.

24:17.640 --> 24:21.000
By the way, Mark Craig came to see
me, upset about your involvement

24:21.000 --> 24:23.800
with a patient, a rabbi.

24:23.800 --> 24:26.240
Mark can be such
an intolerant little man.

24:26.240 --> 24:27.760
Yes.

24:27.760 --> 24:29.480
However, he does have a point.

24:29.480 --> 24:31.240
Pepper, please.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.000
He does not.

24:33.000 --> 24:35.880
Mark's interested in
the health of his patients,

24:35.880 --> 24:37.320
not ridiculous rituals.

24:37.320 --> 24:38.440
Well, precisely.

24:38.440 --> 24:41.920
Volunteers have more time
than physicians

24:41.920 --> 24:43.160
for the little things.

24:43.160 --> 24:47.160
Not when they interfere
with treatment. Salt.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.560
Volunteers are
not helpful?

24:49.560 --> 24:51.200
I didn't say that.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.320
You implied it.

24:52.320 --> 24:56.320
You should be the first to admit
that since the DRGs were instituted,

24:56.880 --> 24:58.640
salaried medical care
has been cut way back.

24:58.640 --> 25:01.160
It's become
non-cost-effective

25:01.160 --> 25:03.440
for hospitals
to provide the TLC.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.000
Volunteers have
taken up the slack.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.920
Escorting patients,
allaying their fears,

25:08.920 --> 25:12.760
talking to their families,
making your job easier.

25:12.760 --> 25:14.480
Of course.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.320
Why are you being
such an old poop?

25:16.320 --> 25:17.920
I'm not.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.360
You're getting
puffed up.

25:19.360 --> 25:22.560
You shouldn't help a patient
impede his own recovery.

25:22.560 --> 25:24.840
I did nothing of the sort.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.120
We are not in the business

25:26.120 --> 25:28.840
to provide people
with a place to pray.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.120
Why don't you tell the rabbi that?

25:30.120 --> 25:31.360
I will.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.840
Of all the absurd...

25:33.840 --> 25:35.280
And don't tell me
how to run my hospital.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.200
And don't tell me
how to run my hospital.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.440
This is what I think
of your hospital.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.240
Don't do that. Katharine!

25:41.240 --> 25:42.560
PLATE SHATTERS

25:42.560 --> 25:44.000
Happy anniversary.

25:44.000 --> 25:48.000
Same to you.

25:49.600 --> 25:53.600
And your mother sent soup.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.400
Are they giving you
enough drugs?

25:57.400 --> 26:00.400
They don't  have
enough drugs.

26:00.400 --> 26:03.080
My son, shot. This is
unbelievable to me.

26:03.080 --> 26:06.360
Candy.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.400
None of these
are on my diet.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.480
I worked so hard to send you
to become a doctor.

26:11.480 --> 26:12.920
You get shot.

26:12.920 --> 26:14.800
How can this happen?
Who's responsible?

26:14.800 --> 26:18.800
No-one, and you only paid
for part of my education.

26:19.120 --> 26:23.120
I had to work to put myself
through school.

26:23.800 --> 26:27.720
Magazines. You know, you could be
working at a good hospital.

26:27.720 --> 26:31.040
Mount Sinai.
Someplace private, nice.

26:31.040 --> 26:33.520
Not some rat hole
where scum shoot doctors

26:33.520 --> 26:36.400
and your mother and I
have to worry.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.840
Why didn't Mom come with you?

26:37.840 --> 26:40.080
She was too upset,

26:40.080 --> 26:43.320
crazy, schreien.
Like you were dead.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.560
I was.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.480
Don't tell her that.

26:45.480 --> 26:49.480
Don't tell her that.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.640
Comic books.

26:51.640 --> 26:53.320
I don't want them.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.400
You used to like them
when you were sick.

26:55.400 --> 26:59.400
They have comic books
in Boston, you know.

27:01.120 --> 27:04.680
Why are you so mad at me?
I didn't do this.

27:04.680 --> 27:07.720
I just came here to be with you.

27:07.720 --> 27:10.360
Why did it take
a hole in my chest?

27:10.360 --> 27:12.200
&lt; Excuse me.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.440
Thought we'd stop by
and try to cheer you up.

27:15.440 --> 27:17.280
Boomer already
gave it a shot.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.720
No, no. Wait, wait.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.000
Here's a pair o' docs

27:20.000 --> 27:22.720
who'd like to
give you a big hand.

27:22.720 --> 27:26.720
Go!

27:31.760 --> 27:33.280
Is he laughing?

27:33.280 --> 27:37.280
I don't know.
I can't see.

27:41.880 --> 27:44.760
I saw someone
do that on TV.

27:44.760 --> 27:48.760
It wasn't funny then, either.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.080
Is the Demerol for Mr...?

27:53.080 --> 27:56.640
Is the Demerol for Mr...?

27:56.640 --> 27:58.360
That cold still lingering?

27:58.360 --> 28:01.360
Can't shake it.

28:01.360 --> 28:02.520
You look a little swollen.

28:02.520 --> 28:06.320
You look a little swollen.

28:06.320 --> 28:09.200
Ah.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.120
Helen, where the hell is Daniel?

28:11.120 --> 28:12.560
Stomping around here someplace.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.240
What about Donald?

28:14.240 --> 28:15.920
He's gone for a while.

28:15.920 --> 28:18.800
These guys... Never around when
the fox is in the chicken coop.

28:18.800 --> 28:19.640
What's the trouble?

28:19.640 --> 28:21.760
What's the trouble?

28:21.760 --> 28:23.160
Give her time.

28:23.160 --> 28:26.000
That woman's tried to steal my job
from the day she arrived.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.680
She sucks up to everyone, calls
the Residents by their first names.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.040
I don't like her methods,
and I don't like her.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.680
Do you have any message
for Donald or Daniel?

28:33.680 --> 28:37.680
Yes. This. (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

28:47.320 --> 28:51.320
DOORBELL RINGS

28:52.360 --> 28:55.520
Hi.  Donald! Hello.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.520
I was in the neighbourhood.
Thought I'd stop by.

28:57.520 --> 28:59.160
I was in the neighbourhood.
Thought I'd stop by.

28:59.160 --> 29:00.400
No. No, thanks.

29:00.400 --> 29:02.920
Oh.

29:02.920 --> 29:04.560
Classifieds.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.280
Seeing if anyone's
hiring a beautician.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.800
Seeing if anyone's
hiring a beautician.

29:07.800 --> 29:10.560
Tired of only touching up
my own hair.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.520
Didn't know you did
that sort of thing.

29:11.520 --> 29:13.920
Didn't know you did
that sort of thing.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.840
No. Not hungry at all, thanks.

29:16.840 --> 29:19.720
What brings you
to the North End?

29:19.720 --> 29:23.520
I bought a bed at a warehouse
over by Lewis Wharf.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.680
Everything OK at the hospital?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.280
Everything OK at the hospital?

29:27.280 --> 29:29.760
I stopped by
to find something out.

29:29.760 --> 29:33.520
Carol and I, uh...
Are we doing all right?

29:33.520 --> 29:35.240
How would I know?

29:35.240 --> 29:37.000
You're her mother. You live together.

29:37.000 --> 29:38.400
Is she happy?

29:38.400 --> 29:39.880
You should ask her yourself.

29:39.880 --> 29:43.240
I don't want
to start anything.

29:43.240 --> 29:45.160
When my husband
was alive,

29:45.160 --> 29:48.040
he and I fought
all the time.

29:48.040 --> 29:52.040
We always knew
where we stood
with each other.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.760
I guess I want reassurance
that this is the right thing.

29:54.760 --> 29:57.640
I guess I want reassurance
that this is the right thing.

29:57.640 --> 29:59.560
We owe you a lot, Donald.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.480
A member of our family

30:01.480 --> 30:04.160
is going to be
somebody important.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.760
A doctor. Because of you.

30:05.760 --> 30:08.400
No, what Carol's done,
she's done on her own.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.640
That's not how she feels.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.960
She'd do anything for you.

30:12.960 --> 30:16.960
I just don't want her to stay with me
cos she feels she owes me something.

30:17.000 --> 30:20.640
My daughter looks
to you like a god.

30:20.640 --> 30:24.080
She'd never let you down.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.840
You have to have a taste
of these cookies.

30:27.840 --> 30:30.240
Yes, he's fine, looks good.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.760
Yes. I'm sure.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.800
Loved the soup.

30:34.800 --> 30:36.640
Yeah. Great time.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.120
Uh...no.
He's resting now.

30:39.120 --> 30:40.800
He'll be calling you later.

30:40.800 --> 30:43.360
OK. Bye-bye.

30:43.360 --> 30:45.560
Your mother sends love.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.480
It's show time!

30:47.480 --> 30:51.480
I brought in
all your favourite
classical comedies.

30:51.480 --> 30:53.640
Marx Brothers, Jack Benny,

30:53.640 --> 30:56.720
Monty Python,
Rocky and Bullwinkle...

30:56.720 --> 30:58.840
We can watch together!

30:58.840 --> 31:02.840
Great. Belly-laughs
guaranteed.

31:08.840 --> 31:09.920
KNOCKING

31:09.920 --> 31:10.520
Yes.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.320
Yes.

31:12.320 --> 31:14.240
Sorry.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.880
Hi. I just stopped by
to see how you're doing.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.640
I had an earful from Mark Craig.

31:18.640 --> 31:20.360
I try to resist, remain calm.

31:20.360 --> 31:22.080
He got to me.

31:22.080 --> 31:24.320
Mark has the knack.

31:24.320 --> 31:26.760
I couldn't let him
walk all over me again.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.200
Then why are you packing?

31:28.200 --> 31:30.400
Because I've nothing to gain
from the fight.

31:30.400 --> 31:34.040
A little personal
satisfaction wouldn't hurt.

31:34.040 --> 31:36.080
I relish every opportunity.

31:36.080 --> 31:38.880
Does arguing ever have an effect
around here?

31:38.880 --> 31:40.680
Very little.

31:40.680 --> 31:43.040
No. The men in power
protect each other.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.000
It's out of loyalty,
not malice,

31:45.000 --> 31:47.120
but still, no excuse.

31:47.120 --> 31:51.000
I'm sorry to lose one of the
few women of influence here.

31:51.000 --> 31:53.400
I left my family
in Maryland

31:53.400 --> 31:56.000
for the opportunity to come
and run the department.

31:56.000 --> 31:58.240
I can be a surgeon
closer to home.

31:58.240 --> 32:00.200
I'd still like to see
you fighting.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.640
Be wasted energy.

32:01.640 --> 32:04.160
Oh! &gt;

32:04.160 --> 32:07.120
Aah!

32:07.120 --> 32:11.120
Besides, I think Mark Craig
deserves his office back.

32:24.880 --> 32:28.880
Rabbi, I'm Daniel Auschlander,
Chief of Services.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.360
I was about to begin my prayers.

32:33.360 --> 32:36.640
It's against fire regulations

32:36.640 --> 32:39.400
to burn candles in a hospital.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.560
That's for my wife.

32:40.560 --> 32:44.560
I'm sorry.

32:47.120 --> 32:49.920
Don't worry, Anna.
Still here.

32:49.920 --> 32:53.920
I came to say we can only go so far
to accommodate your special needs.

32:54.160 --> 32:55.880
Are my requests
so intrusive?

32:55.880 --> 32:58.320
When they interfere with
proper medical care, yes.

32:58.320 --> 33:02.120
Please. I'm dying. I won't be
bothering you much longer.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.520
Dr Craig told me you were only
hypertensive.

33:04.520 --> 33:06.280
He ordered a CT scan
this afternoon

33:06.280 --> 33:09.120
after finding a lump
in my chest.

33:09.120 --> 33:10.880
The cancer is everywhere.

33:10.880 --> 33:14.640
I'll live less than a year.

33:14.640 --> 33:18.640
But why are you so angry at me
for practising my faith?

33:18.880 --> 33:21.600
I was raised Orthodox.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.840
Something happened,
I assume.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.840
Margaret Ryan.

33:26.840 --> 33:29.040
I see.

33:29.040 --> 33:33.040
We feel in love.
I wanted to marry her.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.560
The rabbi condemned.

33:37.560 --> 33:41.360
My parents forbade.

33:41.360 --> 33:42.800
I lost her.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.680
For all my devotion to God,

33:44.680 --> 33:48.360
I was deprived of happiness.

33:48.360 --> 33:52.280
I never went to temple again.

33:52.280 --> 33:53.800
You could have married her anyway.

33:53.800 --> 33:57.080
In a sense, I did.

33:57.080 --> 34:00.040
Many years later
I met my wife.

34:00.040 --> 34:02.560
We wed in the Catholic church.

34:02.560 --> 34:04.480
Dr Auschlander,

34:04.480 --> 34:07.160
I'm sorry you felt
so betrayed,

34:07.160 --> 34:10.800
but there's no fault.
Orthodoxy tries to preserve

34:10.800 --> 34:13.320
a pure ethnic and
religious Judaism.

34:13.320 --> 34:15.120
You're feelings
didn't coincide,

34:15.120 --> 34:16.320
so you walked away.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.480
Religion is there
when people need guidance.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.880
In moments of crisis, a death...

34:22.880 --> 34:26.400
faith offers comfort.

34:26.400 --> 34:30.400
I'd like to pray now.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.440
That's it.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.400
Thank you.

34:53.400 --> 34:54.679
Thank you.

34:54.679 --> 34:58.680
No, why don't you see if you can
find a place in the basement.

34:58.720 --> 34:59.920
Sure, if you want.

34:59.920 --> 35:03.920
Somebody might be able to use it.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.240
Have you seen Carol?

35:36.240 --> 35:40.240
She should be out of surgery.

35:41.840 --> 35:44.920
Donald, do you
have a moment?

35:44.920 --> 35:48.920
Barely. I'm on my way
to talk with Carol.

35:50.720 --> 35:53.920
Do you ever regret
leaving the Catholic church?

35:53.920 --> 35:56.800
       Huh! You want just a  moment
to discuss Catholicism?

35:56.800 --> 36:00.160
I'm sorry. It's been
a full day for me.

36:00.160 --> 36:04.160
I've got a head full of Carol,
Maureen and that bed.

36:04.520 --> 36:07.240
Do I regret it?

36:07.240 --> 36:08.840
Yes, I do, sometimes.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.920
Especially when I think of
Lizzie's first communion.

36:11.920 --> 36:13.680
It's still ingrained in me.

36:13.680 --> 36:16.200
The other day, coming in,
I almost hit a fellow

36:16.200 --> 36:19.680
that ran a red light.
I instinctively crossed myself.

36:19.680 --> 36:23.080
Today I was with a man
dying of cancer,

36:23.080 --> 36:25.480
but you never would
have known it.

36:25.480 --> 36:28.760
He was calm, content,
renewed by his religion.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.520
Sounds like Father McCabe.

36:31.520 --> 36:35.520
And I wonder...by running away
from my faith,

36:36.200 --> 36:37.960
did I deprive myself

36:37.960 --> 36:40.240
of the strength needed
to face death?

36:40.240 --> 36:42.080
You've been very strong,
my friend.

36:42.080 --> 36:45.040
But what if we're
missing something?

36:45.040 --> 36:48.040
Should the end of my life be
reconciled to the beginning?

36:48.040 --> 36:49.320
It's up to you, isn't it?

36:49.320 --> 36:50.760
Oh, by the way, I saw Katharine.

36:50.760 --> 36:54.760
First thing  I'd  do
is make up with her.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.680
(TV) 'Let me
centre the ball.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.240
'OK. 1, 2, 3, hut!

37:03.240 --> 37:06.120
'Now, Bullwinkle.
Alley-oop!

37:06.120 --> 37:08.920
'Well, it was the alley-oop
that did it.'

37:08.920 --> 37:10.760
Funny stuff.

37:10.760 --> 37:13.200
How come it's not on any more?

37:13.200 --> 37:16.040
You're not laughing.

37:16.040 --> 37:17.960
When you were a kid,

37:17.960 --> 37:21.800
we thought you were messed up.
You laughed at everything,

37:21.800 --> 37:25.000
even at your grandmother's funeral.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.800
I finally see Grandma's
point of view.

37:27.800 --> 37:31.400
Well, you had your own way
of looking at the world.

37:31.400 --> 37:34.280
I just didn't understand that
at the time.

37:34.280 --> 37:36.120
Makes sense.

37:36.120 --> 37:40.120
This is the longest
we've been together alone.

37:41.080 --> 37:42.440
Look, we're different.

37:42.440 --> 37:44.880
I was raised by
Lithuanian immigrants.

37:44.880 --> 37:48.080
Good people, but
with old-world values.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.160
You, you're so American,
so modern.

37:50.160 --> 37:54.160
Ringo, Batman, bubble gum,
all that goofiness.

37:54.960 --> 37:57.760
I just didn't relate.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.200
You could've tried.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.000
You never did anything
with me.

38:02.000 --> 38:04.040
Yes, I did.

38:04.040 --> 38:06.880
Right. You took me to
Grant's Tomb one Saturday.

38:06.880 --> 38:10.000
And you laughed all day long...

38:10.000 --> 38:12.760
"Who's buried in Grant's Tomb?
Ha-ha-ha."

38:12.760 --> 38:14.720
You drove me crazy
with your jokes.

38:14.720 --> 38:18.720
DOOR OPENS

38:20.280 --> 38:22.200
Victor?

38:22.200 --> 38:26.200
Hey, Dr Fiscus.

38:34.280 --> 38:35.440
Look, son...

38:35.440 --> 38:37.920
I finally understand.

38:37.920 --> 38:41.920
Truth is, you never liked me.

38:50.720 --> 38:52.560
Looking good, Jack!

38:52.560 --> 38:55.280
Want to grab a beer?
I'm meeting Joanne.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.720
I wish I could. Plans.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.280
Hi.

38:59.280 --> 39:01.480
Hi.

39:01.480 --> 39:03.440
We're not supposed to meet
for another hour, right?

39:03.440 --> 39:06.800
No, right.

39:06.800 --> 39:10.800
Boy, with Dr Barton, you're in
and out of surgery in no time.

39:11.320 --> 39:14.400
By the way, he wants
a new lithotripter.

39:14.400 --> 39:18.400
That'd sure come in handy.

39:19.680 --> 39:22.160
Ah...sure.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.080
Well, got to go.

39:24.080 --> 39:28.080
Yeah. Bye.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.880
&lt; Something the matter?

39:31.880 --> 39:35.640
Carol, I've been thinking
things over.

39:35.640 --> 39:37.680
It doesn't make sense for us
to keep seeing each other.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.840
What?

39:39.840 --> 39:41.400
I'm just not happy.

39:41.400 --> 39:42.800
But Donald...

39:42.800 --> 39:45.200
The difference in our age, &gt;

39:45.200 --> 39:49.200
and we never seem to really
have time together.

39:51.040 --> 39:55.040
Maureen is still inside me.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.280
I thought that's
what you wanted -

39:57.280 --> 39:58.760
to start seeing someone else.

39:58.760 --> 40:00.480
Yeah, it was, for a while.

40:00.480 --> 40:04.480
But I just think a clean break
would be good for both of us.

40:06.400 --> 40:09.880
Give us some time to think
about where we are. OK?

40:09.880 --> 40:11.560
You sure?

40:11.560 --> 40:15.560
Well, if it's what you want, but...

40:15.840 --> 40:19.840
You've been a good pal.

40:20.920 --> 40:22.080
You've been a good pal.

40:22.080 --> 40:26.080
You've been a good pal.

40:47.400 --> 40:50.000
Barton told me I won't be able to
test-drive the prosthesis

40:50.000 --> 40:51.560
for a week or so.

40:51.560 --> 40:53.760
Be in too much pain.

40:53.760 --> 40:54.840
Hiya, Jonas.

40:54.840 --> 40:57.520
Hi, Victor.

40:57.520 --> 40:59.920
Not many places
you can smoke any more.

40:59.920 --> 41:02.800
I ended up by
the cafeteria dumpster.

41:02.800 --> 41:05.640
Met a Dr Craig.
He a big deal?

41:05.640 --> 41:07.440
Around here.

41:07.440 --> 41:10.040
He says you're gonna have
a complete recovery.

41:10.040 --> 41:11.440
You could have asked me.

41:11.440 --> 41:13.360
I'm a doctor.

41:13.360 --> 41:15.760
Yeah, but... Anyway,
the important thing is

41:15.760 --> 41:19.000
you're going to be OK.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.680
And it's getting late.

41:20.680 --> 41:22.000
You can go.

41:22.000 --> 41:23.160
Sure?

41:23.160 --> 41:26.080
Yeah.

41:26.080 --> 41:30.080
Well, I'll be
staying overnight, uh...

41:32.240 --> 41:34.520
Look, how much more
do I have to do

41:34.520 --> 41:37.640
to show you that I care?

41:37.640 --> 41:40.280
What you said before,
you were right.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.600
I never liked you.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.600
I knew it.

41:43.600 --> 41:47.600
I knew it.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.760
Donald, we've got a problem.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.800
I know, Paulette -
Helen already told me.

42:04.800 --> 42:07.560
I talked to Daniel.
He spoke with Judge Farnham.

42:07.560 --> 42:08.840
Where the heck was I?

42:08.840 --> 42:10.120
I don't know.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.560
At least she's out, right?

42:11.560 --> 42:13.000
I'm splitting my job.

42:13.000 --> 42:14.920
Paulette will run
Medical Education.

42:14.920 --> 42:18.000
She's good with the Residents
and she'll do a good job.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.240
Ah, for the love of mon...

42:19.240 --> 42:22.160
Ah, for the love of mon...

42:22.160 --> 42:23.800
You look like hell.
Are you all right?

42:23.800 --> 42:26.200
You look like hell.
Are you all right?

42:26.200 --> 42:27.680
Carol and I said goodbye,
all right?

42:27.680 --> 42:28.960
She pulled the plug?

42:28.960 --> 42:30.480
No, it was my doing.

42:30.480 --> 42:32.200
I thought you were
ass over tea kettle for the girl?

42:32.200 --> 42:33.400
Of course I am.

42:33.400 --> 42:35.080
&lt; Then why'd you call it off?

42:35.080 --> 42:37.000
Because she never would have.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.080
The relationship's
no good for her.

42:38.080 --> 42:39.320
The relationship's
no good for her.

42:39.320 --> 42:43.320
How come I never get
what I want?

42:57.160 --> 42:59.680
&lt; Dying to try this out.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.000
&lt; Here we go.

43:01.000 --> 43:02.520
AIR PASSES THROUGH PUMP

43:02.520 --> 43:05.320
&lt; Anticipation.

43:05.320 --> 43:08.960
&lt; Mm... Stimulation.

43:08.960 --> 43:11.800
&lt; Arousal!

43:11.800 --> 43:14.320
&lt; Not bad.

43:14.320 --> 43:18.160
&lt; Now, let's see what this baby
can really do.

43:18.160 --> 43:20.640
&lt; Arousal.

43:20.640 --> 43:22.760
&lt; Big heat.

43:22.760 --> 43:25.840
&lt; Going crazy!

43:25.840 --> 43:27.800
&lt; Maxed out!

43:27.800 --> 43:29.520
BANG

43:29.520 --> 43:32.520
&lt; Uh-oh.

43:32.520 --> 43:36.520
&lt; Boy, that hurts.

43:37.640 --> 43:41.640
Gotcha!

43:46.000 --> 43:50.000
TANNOY ANNOUNCEMENT

43:50.920 --> 43:54.920
LIFT PINGS

44:02.920 --> 44:06.200
Seems like we'll
be working together...

44:06.200 --> 44:10.200
very closely.

44:21.440 --> 44:23.280
Well, there you are.

44:23.280 --> 44:24.360
Leaving?

44:24.360 --> 44:25.800
All through for the day.

44:25.800 --> 44:29.800
Let me help you.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.960
Katharine, about today.

44:33.960 --> 44:37.960
I'm sorry.

44:41.000 --> 44:43.680
"Excuse me...

44:43.680 --> 44:45.800
"could you please tell me
where in this town

44:45.800 --> 44:49.800
"they mix a good
old-fashioned egg cream?"

44:50.560 --> 44:53.480
Then you said...

44:53.480 --> 44:56.040
"Come on."

44:56.040 --> 44:58.120
And then you said...

44:58.120 --> 45:00.960
"I haven't had
an egg cream in years."

45:00.960 --> 45:04.840
And...

45:04.840 --> 45:06.760
"I'm sure you'd get one

45:06.760 --> 45:10.600
"at Hobson's
on Franklin Street.

45:10.600 --> 45:13.480
"You take Essex
to Tremont...

45:13.480 --> 45:15.720
"..turn right,
go three blocks,

45:15.720 --> 45:19.320
"and it's just across
the way from the cyclorama.

45:19.320 --> 45:21.040
"Wait a moment.

45:21.040 --> 45:23.520
"Turn right on Essex,
go two blocks and then?

45:23.520 --> 45:25.120
"Oh, never mind.

45:25.120 --> 45:27.400
"You want me
to show you?

45:27.400 --> 45:29.920
"That would be lovely."

45:29.920 --> 45:33.920
Our first date.

45:35.800 --> 45:39.800
Our first kiss.

46:06.920 --> 46:13.000
