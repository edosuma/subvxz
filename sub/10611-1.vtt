(BLUES MUSIC PLAYING)

01:19.830 --> 01:20.830
RONNY: You've got to picture this.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.749
It was freshman year, there he is,

01:22.833 --> 01:27.420
completely naked, right outside the office!

01:28.130 --> 01:29.839
RONNY: And he says, "Ronny told me to show up."

01:29.923 --> 01:31.799
GENEVA: Hey, I have a question for the table.

01:31.884 --> 01:35.428
How long does it take to really know someone?

01:35.846 --> 01:38.055
BETH: I think you're continually
getting to know someone.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.266
'Cause I think people change when they grow.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.144
But I do think if you go through hell with someone,

01:43.228 --> 01:45.772
then you get a pretty good sense
of how they handle stuff,

01:45.856 --> 01:47.315
which is important.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.359
Come on, we're on the other side of that one.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.945
I don't know.

01:53.030 --> 01:56.699
I think you can know someone within
the first 10 seconds of seeing them.

01:56.867 --> 01:59.035
I mean, I fell in love with Geneva the second I saw her.

01:59.495 --> 02:00.495
Aw...

02:00.579 --> 02:01.996
It's true. I did.

02:02.539 --> 02:05.374
RONNY: Well, I don't know if you ever
really know someone entirely.

02:05.459 --> 02:06.959
And what is that supposed to mean? Yeah.

02:07.044 --> 02:10.295
Well, I mean, you know someone,
you think pretty good,

02:10.380 --> 02:13.007
and then you find out stuff that's shocking
that you didn't know existed.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.217
I think that happens every day.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.969
Look at that show 20/20, it's always
the same thing, right?

02:17.054 --> 02:19.180
They're a couple, they're happy,
no one could believe it.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.389
There are a lot of these cases.

02:20.474 --> 02:21.557
What about the guy with the crossbow?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.643
He buys a crossbow, he's practicing in the garage.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.144
"By the way, bring me some lemonade.

02:25.229 --> 02:28.064
"Oh, my goodness, I had no idea you walked
through at that moment. Oops!"

02:28.190 --> 02:30.483
Continue, please. Continue. BETH: That is gross!

02:30.567 --> 02:33.402
But she forgives him. It was an
accident, and guess what?

02:33.487 --> 02:36.364
Six months later, same accident. Yes, and it kills her.

02:36.615 --> 02:37.865
No! Yes!

02:37.950 --> 02:38.991
(LAUGHS) No!

02:39.743 --> 02:42.370
And, lookit, you hear all the time about these families

02:42.538 --> 02:44.747
that have entirely other families.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.165
The dad, who knows what he does for a living,

02:46.250 --> 02:47.667
he leaves to go to Connecticut.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.002
But he was never going to Connecticut on business.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.213
He's really going to Harlem. He's
got a Puerto Rican family

02:52.297 --> 02:53.506
that no one ever heard about. Yeah.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.634
You think when he's watching the game, instead
of pretzels, he's eating Goya beans.

02:56.718 --> 02:58.052
Red flags, but they don't catch it.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.805
So my point is, you can really
think you know somebody,

03:00.889 --> 03:03.599
and then it turns out that you don't
know everything about somebody.

03:03.684 --> 03:05.560
All right, Ronny. You still haven't
answered the question.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.436
No, I just did. You didn't.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.063
No, you didn't answer it. You're skirting it.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.606
You're not answering straight up. Come on.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.317
You're bouncing around, you're doing
this, "Hey!" When you're doing this...

03:13.402 --> 03:14.527
You do that a lot, by the way.

03:14.611 --> 03:15.862
I think you're all special peoples.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.196
You're out of your mind!

03:17.281 --> 03:19.115
And you're nothing of the sort.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.045
(CHATTERING)

03:33.255 --> 03:34.338
(CAMERA CLICKS)

03:35.883 --> 03:37.633
(MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA)

03:38.302 --> 03:41.053
This is our shot. I need you to hug him.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.347
I don't want to hug him.

03:43.432 --> 03:45.558
Lookit, ever since he had a near-death experience,

03:45.642 --> 03:48.728
he's become a very touchy-feely
guy, and he likes to be held.

03:48.812 --> 03:51.606
Look, you know I don't like touching
people I don't know very well, okay?

03:51.690 --> 03:53.566
Or even people I do. So just...

03:53.650 --> 03:56.319
Nick, do you want this thing or not?

03:57.321 --> 03:58.362
Of course I do.

03:58.447 --> 03:59.655
Then feed the beast here!

03:59.740 --> 04:03.743
This guy has a hot button, a point
of interest. His hot button is hugs.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.245
You hug him, you're gonna crack him wide open!

04:06.330 --> 04:08.080
He's going to start feeling all bubbly inside.

04:08.165 --> 04:09.332
Then he starts writing checks!

04:09.666 --> 04:10.750
All right.

04:10.834 --> 04:13.085
I'm not asking you to go to an airport motel

04:13.170 --> 04:15.212
and perform a trick on a Japanese businessman.

04:15.297 --> 04:19.091
I'm asking you to hug a senior executive
from General Motors, that's all!

04:19.176 --> 04:20.468
Now get your arms around him,

04:20.552 --> 04:22.637
and make him feel bubbly and warm!

04:28.101 --> 04:29.101
I'll tell you what.

04:29.186 --> 04:33.940
Why don't you let Charles take you guys
over here and show you the entire line.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.149
And it's great to have you here.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.234
Thank you so much for coming. MAN: Thank you.

04:37.319 --> 04:38.611
Man!

04:38.695 --> 04:40.947
This puppy here reminds me of my first Dodge.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.031
Uh-huh?

04:42.115 --> 04:43.449
Remember that?

04:43.533 --> 04:46.786
Remember when cars were meant just
to be fun things to have, right?

04:46.870 --> 04:47.870
(LAUGHS)

04:47.955 --> 04:51.958
They made a cool noise, they harnessed real power

04:52.042 --> 04:53.626
and they made you feel like a badass

04:53.710 --> 04:56.712
because you got to be the one right
there behind the wheel of it, right?

04:57.172 --> 05:00.091
I'm sorry, I'm Ronny Valentine
from B & V Engine Design.

05:00.217 --> 05:02.301
Thomas Fern. Yeah, Thomas, good to see you again.

05:02.386 --> 05:06.514
We actually helped you out with a few
ECU modules a few years back.

05:06.598 --> 05:08.224
Of course. Yeah.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.644
Hey, that's... There, my partner, Nick Brannen.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.813
Congrats.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.691
It's gonna be a great year. It really is.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.734
Of course.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.029
(WHISPERING) Your soul was too important to take.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.365
You've got great days ahead of you, my friend.

05:24.741 --> 05:27.493
You know, we actually have one idea
we're not committed to anyone on.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.995
We could run it by your team,

05:29.079 --> 05:30.955
and see if it's something that made sense for you.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.581
I'd love that.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.208
Maybe we could get something on the books.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.794
We'll come up there to Rock City,
to Detroit, and come see you.

05:39.423 --> 05:40.798
Okay. Yeah.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.803
You lying bastard!

05:45.929 --> 05:48.055
You are unbelievable. Did we get the meeting or not?

05:48.140 --> 05:49.932
I'm hugging this man like I'm some kind of asshole...

05:50.017 --> 05:51.350
BETH: Now, why were you hugging the man?

05:51.435 --> 05:52.977
Because he's our guy's direct competitor.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.187
Why would you hug the direct competitor?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.564
Because he had a near-death experience.

05:56.648 --> 05:57.648
RONNY: Actually, no, he didn't.

05:58.608 --> 06:00.109
That never happened. I made that up.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.028
(CHUCKLES) Shame, shame, shame.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.863
What are you doing? What do
you mean, what am I doing?

06:03.947 --> 06:05.281
Did we get the meeting or what?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.365
Come on, Nick.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.367
I'm never hugging again. I'm not listening to you.

06:08.452 --> 06:09.493
He sets me up!

06:09.578 --> 06:12.079
What do you expect me to do? Geneva, listen to me.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.622
You know him, he's way too honest.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.249
If I fill him in on it, what happens?

06:15.417 --> 06:18.878
The sweating, he starts hyperventilating,
he passes out!

06:18.962 --> 06:20.379
It was completely necessary.

06:20.464 --> 06:22.965
Nick, my man,

06:24.968 --> 06:26.677
we got the meeting.

06:27.763 --> 06:31.140
I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes, I love your boyfriend.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.850
You, I will hug. This is free. I'll hug you right back!

06:32.976 --> 06:34.018
This is no charge! Come in here! My man!

06:34.102 --> 06:35.644
Don't ever let me go.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.981
(BLUES MUSIC PLAYING)

06:43.320 --> 06:44.987
They've had a couple of lessons. Yeah!

06:45.322 --> 06:46.489
Okay, let's dance.

06:46.990 --> 06:48.908
Less is more. I'm dancing on the inside.

06:49.034 --> 06:50.284
Are you dancing right now? Yes.

06:50.368 --> 06:51.494
Oh, okay.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.246
Honey, listen, you can never trust a man who dances.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.539
Look at the great men throughout history,

06:55.624 --> 06:56.957
none of them were dancers.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.335
Abraham Lincoln? Not a big dancer.

06:59.419 --> 07:01.754
Winston Churchill, he never tore up the dance floor.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.256
Martin Luther King, he might've had
a dream, but he never danced to it.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.674
Okay, come on. I'm serious.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.676
Come on, tiny dancer, let's go.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.804
You plant it here right now.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.348
Look, you think they're great, and they're dancing.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.519
RONNY: I think they're better than
great. I think they're the best.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.021
When it comes to being a couple, they're my heroes.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.525
Hey! Come on, why you sitting? Get up, let's do this!

07:22.818 --> 07:24.568
Oh, Nick, you know, Ronny here,

07:24.653 --> 07:26.278
he just called you his hero couple,

07:26.363 --> 07:28.447
and yet he still refuses to dance with me.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.366
Will you stop? Do not give him ammo.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.284
(STUTTERS)

07:32.369 --> 07:34.662
Ronny just told Beth I'm his hero. I'm your hero!

07:34.746 --> 07:36.163
You're the worst.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.874
Oh, come on. Every kid wants to dance with his hero!

07:38.959 --> 07:40.376
Bring it up here!

07:40.544 --> 07:41.961
Let's do it.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.767
Yo!

07:57.435 --> 07:59.019
Blue! Set! Hut! Hut!

08:00.188 --> 08:02.064
Go long, baby! Go long!

08:04.734 --> 08:05.776
Yes!

08:05.861 --> 08:06.861
Whoo-hoo!

08:18.415 --> 08:19.623
My man.

08:20.917 --> 08:23.419
That just happened. Oh, yeah.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.421
I don't think I'll ever forget that!

08:25.505 --> 08:27.631
Oh, great. Is that burned in the hard drive now?

08:27.716 --> 08:29.091
Mmm-hmm. I think so.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.890
Excuse me.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.601
Hey, I need to do this.

08:39.227 --> 08:40.936
Let me show you how this is done.

08:41.020 --> 08:42.270
Be my guest.

08:47.319 --> 08:48.360
Come on, pal.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.988
I think you're stuck with me.

08:53.909 --> 08:55.618
So when are you gonna ask her?

08:56.411 --> 08:57.536
What?

08:57.621 --> 08:59.330
Come on, Ronny!

08:59.414 --> 09:01.332
You can see it all over her face!

09:03.585 --> 09:06.045
You're never gonna find a girl as great as her.

09:06.129 --> 09:07.296
Let's be realistic.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.049
Nick and I aren't making any new friends.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.219
You've dated all my girlfriends.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.262
You've batted through the whole lineup,

09:15.555 --> 09:18.474
and there's nothing left, you know?

09:18.808 --> 09:20.517
Plus, we like her.

09:20.602 --> 09:22.978
Those other ones, we didn't even
like, and they're my friends!

09:24.898 --> 09:26.148
Trust me.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.485
Pop the question or you're gonna lose her.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.822
NICK: (LAUGHS) There you go! Hey, hey!

09:33.990 --> 09:37.159
Special delivery! How's that for an entrance?

09:38.328 --> 09:39.370
You were missed.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.829
I missed you, too.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.503
(CHUCKLES)

09:47.587 --> 09:49.088
What? Nothing.

09:51.508 --> 09:52.800
Now I'm gonna turn up the heat.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.803
What happens when the kitchen gets hot,
because I'm cooking something up, chef.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.097
Don't play into my strength.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.849
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

10:02.852 --> 10:03.894
Whoo!

10:03.979 --> 10:05.562
Fifteen to four! (LAUGHS)

10:06.064 --> 10:07.731
Really? You're gonna start... Now you're dancing?

10:07.816 --> 10:10.359
It's like I'm playing Floyd Mayweather
at Ping-Pong. That's ridiculous.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.820
You're only supposed to do that if the game's over.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.321
If the game's over. I'm just being happy, you know?

10:14.406 --> 10:16.699
No, no, you're not being happy. This is a taunting.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.242
This is, like, taunting that's going on. I'm sorry.

10:18.368 --> 10:19.743
You're not sorry, that's the problem.

10:19.828 --> 10:20.828
I know. You're right.

10:20.912 --> 10:21.954
Okay, here's what we need to do now.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.539
'Cause I think you're very spirited, and I like that.

10:23.623 --> 10:26.625
I think we should turn it into
full-body-contact Ping-Pong.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.793
(LAUGHS EXCITEDLY) Yes, we do!

10:28.086 --> 10:30.254
Come on, you can't taunt people bigger than you

10:30.338 --> 10:32.172
and expect it just to be all fine.

10:32.257 --> 10:33.382
Help! (SCREAMS)

10:34.050 --> 10:35.217
(LAUGHING)

10:35.802 --> 10:37.219
You're attacked. Yes! That's it.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.388
Are you gonna try and steal a kiss now?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.140
Go on, I dare you.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.734
I want to let you know, by the way,

10:51.818 --> 10:54.820
that I'm completely committed to this relationship.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.363
I'm just re-upping. I'm already committed,

10:56.448 --> 10:58.615
but I'm just re-upping my commitment
to this relationship

10:58.700 --> 10:59.783
because I feel great.

11:00.285 --> 11:01.577
How do you feel? Do you feel great?

11:01.661 --> 11:02.661
Uh-huh.

11:02.746 --> 11:04.955
Yeah? Mmm-hmm. I feel great.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.293
(SLOW LOVE SONG PLAYING)

11:13.089 --> 11:14.965
But is there a window?

11:15.508 --> 11:16.842
Are you anxious for this to go somewhere?

11:16.926 --> 11:19.094
Ronny, Ronny, I know you.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.262
I know where you're headed with this.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.724
Look, I don't need this to be something that it's not.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.643
I don't want it to be something if
it's not, just to make me okay.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.691
But is there a clock that's ticking?

11:32.776 --> 11:35.319
Are you in a hurry to be heading somewhere?

11:35.403 --> 11:38.739
There's always a clock. And I'm worrying, is it ticking,

11:38.823 --> 11:40.491
getting to a point where the clock's gonna go off?

11:40.575 --> 11:42.659
Let's just talk through this, okay? Yeah.

11:43.286 --> 11:46.330
I have fun with you. I love being with you.

11:46.414 --> 11:50.667
I think we've done a great job of getting
back to a really good place.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.212
I'm happy.

11:53.296 --> 11:57.549
Now, if all of that rolls into something else,

11:57.634 --> 11:59.802
that can make me happy, too.

12:02.222 --> 12:06.016
I love you.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.354
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

12:14.484 --> 12:16.360
Okay, Ronny. You can do this.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.903
This is your time to do it.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.738
You the man, Valentine. You're the man.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.299
MALE STEWARD ON PA: Folks, this is our
final approach to Detroit's Metro Airport.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.101
(EXHALES NERVOUSLY)

12:50.145 --> 12:51.895
Hope this goes well.

12:57.360 --> 13:01.071
Great moments are born from great opportunity.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.366
And that's what you have here today, Nick.

13:04.451 --> 13:07.578
That's what you've earned here today!

13:07.704 --> 13:09.997
One meeting. (STAMMERS) Okay, what are you doing?

13:10.081 --> 13:11.290
You're giving me the... Really?

13:11.374 --> 13:13.417
The Kurt Russell speech from the movie Miracle?

13:13.501 --> 13:15.711
I just saw that five-year-old kid do
it on YouTube the other night,

13:15.795 --> 13:17.129
and I thought it was really inspirational.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.630
It's applicable to what we're doing.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.175
Any time you go into a pressure situation,
a competition, it makes sense.

13:21.259 --> 13:22.551
And I'm not gonna write something better than that.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.761
Look at you, you're nervous.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.056
You're never nervous. Now, you're nervous.

13:28.433 --> 13:31.852
Okay, here's the thing. I can't be
broke if I'm gonna get married.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.604
Yeah?

13:33.688 --> 13:36.648
Yes! See, I knew you would get here!

13:36.733 --> 13:38.150
Okay, so here's my plan.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.569
I'm gonna ask her next month, on her birthday.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.654
Now, I worked out this great
deal from this Hasidic guy,

13:42.739 --> 13:44.156
who I met during Gamblers Anonymous.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.493
He's literally gonna give me a $20,000 ring
for $10,000. Can you believe that?

13:47.577 --> 13:48.619
How are you doing that?

13:48.703 --> 13:49.661
Well, I'm gonna give him cash.

13:49.746 --> 13:52.498
And then I also said that you would help fix his car.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.501
So those two little things are gonna
get me the deal with the Hasidic.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.336
Oh, I'm helping? I'm helping fix the car?

13:57.420 --> 13:59.004
Well, you're the one who kept telling me to dive into it.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.339
I thought you'd be excited to help. I'm sorry.

14:00.423 --> 14:02.341
Okay, fine, but that is my gift to you.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.468
Honestly, there'll be no fruit bowl from the registry.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.594
That's it. That's what you're looking at.

14:05.678 --> 14:06.720
You don't have to make a decision now.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.013
On the day, see what's right...

14:08.097 --> 14:10.474
No, I'm making... I can make the
decision now. I'm making it now.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.017
I'm telling you right now, that is my gift.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.645
That's it. I'm fixing the car with the Hasidic guy.

14:14.729 --> 14:15.771
And make sure you tell Beth that, too.

14:15.897 --> 14:17.731
Seriously, I don't want it to be
uncomfortable. Let her know.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.066
Whatever you wanna do on that day is your choice.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.901
Okay. I'm doing it.

14:23.238 --> 14:25.614
You take this meeting 10 times,
you might not get it nine.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.533
All right, you got to stop that now.

14:27.617 --> 14:29.743
But not this meeting, Nick.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.079
Not today.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.580
(EXHALES) You're really making me nervous.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.625
Today, we are the greatest small business in the world.

14:36.834 --> 14:40.420
I'm sick and tired of hearing about how
innovative these other boutiques are.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.674
This is our time. Their time is done!

14:43.967 --> 14:45.384
We're showing up in a cab.

14:53.601 --> 14:57.271
NICK: Thanks for not mentioning that my
last three prototype bids got rejected.

14:57.355 --> 14:59.606
That's just a bad streak, pal.

14:59.691 --> 15:02.067
You're gonna be great, I promise you.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.151
(EXHALES)

15:12.829 --> 15:14.288
Here you go.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.749
Ladies and gentlemen, electric cars,

15:18.876 --> 15:20.168
they're totally gay.

15:20.920 --> 15:21.962
It's true.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.839
I don't mean that they're "homosexual" gay,

15:23.923 --> 15:28.510
but I do mean "your parents were the
chaperone at the dance" gay. Right?

15:28.595 --> 15:30.345
"You tuck it in and wear it real high" gay.

15:30.680 --> 15:32.681
I don't wanna disrespect anybody,
'cause I'm not about that.

15:32.974 --> 15:34.099
But I think we're understanding

15:34.183 --> 15:35.684
what we're trying to talk about here, right?

15:37.979 --> 15:40.814
I mean, honestly, the Nissan Spit? Really?

15:41.441 --> 15:42.691
It screams this.

15:46.487 --> 15:47.529
Oh, here we go.

15:48.031 --> 15:50.699
The Hyundai Pomegranate. Right?

15:51.951 --> 15:55.329
The Chevy Fingerprint.

15:57.624 --> 15:58.665
Now,

16:00.460 --> 16:01.501
ah, look at this.

16:01.878 --> 16:08.383
The 1966 Ford GT350.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.054
You wanna roll up in that one, hoss?

16:12.805 --> 16:17.392
The 1965 Pontiac GTO.

16:17.727 --> 16:19.645
Completely awesome.

16:20.355 --> 16:24.358
The 1970 Hemi Cuda

16:24.984 --> 16:28.445
took more virginities than Francis Albert Sinatra.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.489
What are we suggesting here?

16:30.573 --> 16:34.159
We're talking about taking the benefits
of electric transportation,

16:34.243 --> 16:37.496
but combine them with the rock and roll-ness

16:37.580 --> 16:42.125
and the sexiness that the Dodge
current muscle-car models have.

16:43.711 --> 16:44.795
Nicholas?

16:45.922 --> 16:48.924
We believe we could produce the technology

16:49.008 --> 16:52.511
to incorporate an electronic motor
in your current models.

16:53.638 --> 16:56.723
But with the aggressive sound character,

16:57.225 --> 16:59.768
the exhilarating vibration character,

17:00.561 --> 17:02.771
the complete visceral experience

17:03.189 --> 17:07.983
that we've all grown to know and love in
the Dodge Challenger and Charger lines.

17:08.361 --> 17:11.113
SUSAN: Guys, we love our current electric models.

17:11.196 --> 17:14.281
That said, we also agree there's a
market for what you're pitching.

17:14.826 --> 17:18.787
But, if you're asking Dodge to invest
in your pursuit of this concept,

17:19.247 --> 17:21.455
what do you have that we don't?

17:24.127 --> 17:25.502
Nick Brannen.

17:26.128 --> 17:27.378
(BREATHES NERVOUSLY)

17:30.299 --> 17:31.425
So let's forget the up-front money.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.136
Let's deal with it in success because that's
exactly what we're gonna have.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.556
I want 900,000, you want 400,000.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.892
We don't need to get a Chinese auction where
I go, "850." You go, "450," right?

17:40.977 --> 17:42.060
"Eight." "Five."

17:42.145 --> 17:45.605
Let's just cut it right down the middle
at 775, and close this thing.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.649
(LAUGHS)

17:49.485 --> 17:51.445
I appreciate your spirit, Mr. Valentine.

17:51.946 --> 17:53.613
But we're taking all the risk,

17:53.698 --> 17:55.699
so we'll stick with the 400,000.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.493
And I think you need to focus
on the bigger picture, here.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.621
With success and a good working relationship,

18:01.706 --> 18:05.584
we're prepared to offer you an overall
deal, which means up-front money

18:05.960 --> 18:09.629
and an option for an exclusive long-term
contract with your company.

18:09.714 --> 18:13.216
And with that deal, you gentlemen
won't be disappointed.

18:14.135 --> 18:16.720
You made a great decision today, Tom.

18:17.889 --> 18:18.972
Thank you. Thank you.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.725
You'll be under the supervision of Susan Warner, here.

18:22.268 --> 18:26.229
She's from the outside, but we've
had great experience with her.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.859
SUSAN: You know, I was at Ford
until about five months ago.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.195
They're still talking about you guys over there.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.614
They said you could whittle down a supplier

18:35.698 --> 18:38.408
to less than 15 cents on the dollar just by talking.

18:38.493 --> 18:42.829
And you were like a mad scientist that
wouldn't leave the lab for days.

18:43.581 --> 18:44.706
Well, boys,

18:45.541 --> 18:47.542
it takes one to know one.

18:48.002 --> 18:49.211
I'm one of you.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.087
I'm a visionary, I'm a maverick,

18:51.172 --> 18:53.048
I'm a gun-slinger, just like you.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.592
And this idea of yours, this vision...

18:55.760 --> 18:57.135
(CHUCKLES)

18:57.553 --> 18:59.846
I'm inspired by what y'all throwing down.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.015
I got some serious lady wood here.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.518
I want to have sex with your words.

19:04.602 --> 19:06.228
I want to bang your brain!

19:06.395 --> 19:07.437
(LAUGHS)

19:07.522 --> 19:09.314
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

19:09.857 --> 19:13.401
Oh. I got to go. I'm late for Mommy
and Me. I'll call you.

19:13.569 --> 19:14.945
Bye. Okay.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.406
At least she's enthusiastic.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.367
(STAMMERING) Ronny, I got to tell you,

19:20.451 --> 19:22.786
(CLEARS THROAT) I think I'm starting
to have a panic attack.

19:22.870 --> 19:26.456
What if I can't deliver? I mean, we
sank every cent we have into this.

19:26.541 --> 19:29.167
We're mortgaged to the hilt, we're
borrowing against borrowing.

19:29.252 --> 19:30.460
Okay, listen, just relax.

19:30.545 --> 19:33.421
I think you're taking this all in a little
too fast, just a little too soon.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.589
Now, you said it yourself.

19:34.924 --> 19:36.925
We're on the five-yard line, we just got to punch it in.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.051
Twenty-five. What?

19:38.135 --> 19:39.511
I said we were on the 25-yard line.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.138
Nick, are you suggesting that we're
not even in the red zone?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.432
Oh, man, what if I can't do it?

19:45.059 --> 19:47.602
Everybody... Just think, Dodge is gonna
know, they're gonna laugh at us.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.354
That guy, that security guard, he's just laughing.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.522
Look at him, he's just staring... Hold on.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.815
Look at the security guard, he's looking at me.

19:51.941 --> 19:53.525
Okay, stop. Get it together. Stop looking at me.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.193
Just take a breath for a second.

19:55.278 --> 19:56.486
Don't lose perspective here.

19:56.571 --> 19:58.446
You're only five yards from the red zone.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.448
Now once we get in the red zone, we're a mortal lock.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.533
You're a red-zone guy!

20:01.617 --> 20:03.994
Still 25 yards out, do you understand that?

20:04.078 --> 20:06.872
By the way, I don't care how you spin
it, how you want to ice the cake,

20:06.956 --> 20:08.456
we're only 75 % of the way there,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.166
and I'm having trouble breathing now.

20:10.251 --> 20:11.918
(WHISPERING) You need to relax!

20:13.004 --> 20:16.381
Everything is going to be fine.

20:19.677 --> 20:22.304
(WHISPERING) I never said we were in the red zone.

20:27.184 --> 20:29.644
(PEOPLE CHATTERING) (PLATES CLATTERING)

20:32.648 --> 20:33.982
So, it's been 10 days since the meeting,

20:34.066 --> 20:35.400
and he still hasn't calmed down.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.235
I'm doing my best to keep his head in the game,

20:37.320 --> 20:39.070
but he's still a little shaky.

20:39.155 --> 20:41.323
All right, we are going with the opakapaka tonight.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.033
Okay, but we need to educate the servers,

20:43.117 --> 20:44.159
please. They know, chef.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.577
They know. No, they don't know!

20:45.661 --> 20:47.662
They're fish-illiterate.

20:47.997 --> 20:48.997
What about you, Ronny?

20:49.332 --> 20:51.458
Also fish-illiterate. I don't know fish.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.752
I'm saying, how are you doing?

20:53.836 --> 20:55.295
How are you coping with all of this?

20:55.379 --> 20:56.796
I'm great, honey.

20:56.881 --> 21:00.216
It's been 16 months and nine days since
I made a bet, I'm easy-breezy.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.801
I'm not talking about gambling.

21:01.886 --> 21:04.638
I'm just saying, if you're feeling stressed,

21:04.722 --> 21:06.973
or if things start to feel heavy...

21:07.183 --> 21:08.308
Yes, heavy.

21:08.392 --> 21:11.102
...then you can come talk to me.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.855
Honey, if I'm lucky enough to get
you alone for five minutes,

21:13.940 --> 21:15.774
the last thing I'm going to do is talk.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.233
Is that so? Mmm.

21:24.533 --> 21:26.201
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

21:41.008 --> 21:42.550
When did you say her birthday was?

21:42.635 --> 21:43.677
Two weeks.

21:43.928 --> 21:46.304
Oh, good, we'll have the new Pacific Calendulas in.

21:46.389 --> 21:47.597
Oh, great. She'll love that.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.683
Yes, we had a hybridizing program this winter.

21:49.767 --> 21:51.393
This is awesome!

21:52.103 --> 21:54.229
Wow. This is what I'm talking about.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.648
See this, right here, this place here is beautiful.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.900
And the music that you're playing,
that's really beautiful, too.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.777
People say that music is the highest art form.

22:00.903 --> 22:03.238
It can go the farthest, the fastest, emotionally.

22:03.406 --> 22:05.657
And the smells here are really nice
as well. I love all the smells.

22:05.741 --> 22:09.619
What I'm trying to do is get all five senses
really coming alive here, really cooking.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.538
Mmm-hmm. Do you have a plug
in the garden somewhere?

22:11.622 --> 22:13.999
Somewhere I can plug my iPod dock into.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.875
Anywhere in here? Back here? Oh, see, wait, wait, no.

22:15.960 --> 22:18.003
We don't like the guest touching the plants.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.879
Why? I mean, if you talk to them, they grow.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.923
They like a little affection. I wouldn't pull it out.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.759
I just wanna make sure that you're taking
care of all the things on your end.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.429
Because I'm going today. I'm going to have the ring.

22:27.596 --> 22:28.680
So that'll be taken care of.

22:28.764 --> 22:30.098
I trust you'll have a ring.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.976
And I just want to make sure that
this is the greatest proposal

22:33.060 --> 22:35.520
in the history of the world of all proposals.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.604
All right? That's it.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.899
Let me see if I can track down where that outlet is.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.359
Okay. Get me in here for a team.

22:41.444 --> 22:42.610
Let's go, "Proposal," on three.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.446
Let's have fun with it. Ready? Okay.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.781
One, two, three... Proposal! Proposal!

22:46.866 --> 22:49.075
My man! Get out of here, baby!

22:50.119 --> 22:51.119
Make it good.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.954
I'm counting on you.

22:55.166 --> 22:56.791

Ah! Those plants are poisonous!

25:12.678 --> 25:13.928
Awesome.

25:14.680 --> 25:16.848
You can expect diarrhea,

25:16.932 --> 25:20.643
challenging urination with possible bloody discharge,

25:21.437 --> 25:24.189
fever, dry-heaving,

25:24.273 --> 25:27.483
painful swelling of the gums and
a loss of feeling in the tongue,

25:27.568 --> 25:31.279
which will affect speech and give you very bad dreams.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.046
it's going to run into the thousands.

25:48.339 --> 25:51.549
I just saw my best friend's wife with another man.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.968
I'll send you a check.

25:55.346 --> 25:56.846

I didn't think you were allergic
to anything. Neither did I.

26:07.942 --> 26:10.151
Huh. What kind of plants were they?

26:11.862 --> 26:12.946
Street plants.

26:13.989 --> 26:15.031
Street plants?

26:15.658 --> 26:18.076
Yeah. It must've happened when
I was walking on Clark,

26:18.160 --> 26:21.120
because I had to go... These kids lost their ball,

26:21.205 --> 26:23.289
and I had to go in the bushes and get their ball.

26:23.457 --> 26:25.583
Why couldn't they get their own ball?

26:25.668 --> 26:28.169
Well, you know how these kids are
today, they're so damn lazy.

26:28.504 --> 26:32.048
I mean, with all the gaming, and
texting, and Happy Meals.

26:32.132 --> 26:34.550
I mean, childhood obesity is completely out of control.

26:34.635 --> 26:36.052
You know that, Beth.

26:36.136 --> 26:40.348
And these kids were just overly huffing
and puffing, and they were sweating.

26:40.432 --> 26:43.601
All right. Well, I don't see why that means
they can't go get their own ball.

26:43.686 --> 26:45.853
Well, to their credit, these little porkers were trying,

26:45.938 --> 26:47.981
but they couldn't reach the ball.

26:48.065 --> 26:49.691
This little alligator-armed kid was in there doing it,

26:49.775 --> 26:51.317
but the little kid, he can't get the ball.

26:51.902 --> 26:53.528
So then I come walking up,

26:53.612 --> 26:56.155
and they say, "Hey, can you
help me with the ball here?"

26:56.240 --> 26:57.782
So I say, "Okay, I'm running late,"

26:57.866 --> 27:00.910
but these kids want to play ball, and
frankly, I'm a supporter of it.

27:00.995 --> 27:02.829
Now that we're all gonna be on the
same damn healthcare, too.

27:02.913 --> 27:04.163

27:04.248 --> 27:05.581
Boom! I drop to the ground.

27:05.666 --> 27:07.083
So now, I'm reaching in here like this

27:07.167 --> 27:08.376
trying to get the ball, see?

27:08.460 --> 27:10.420
But I don't want this branch to hit me here.

27:10.713 --> 27:12.463
Right. I'm doing it. You see what I mean, honey?

27:12.548 --> 27:15.675
And I got to dig in more, under the
branch, but hold the branch.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.260
But then my right hand's going here.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.178
See, that's why I got this bitch right here.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.264
Oh. That's a direct contact.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.682
And I get the ball. Now I get it.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.600
I got the ball out, "Okay, here."

27:25.019 --> 27:26.394
Gave the ball back to the kids,

27:26.687 --> 27:28.354
then I started to head home. Right?

27:28.439 --> 27:30.857
And then that's when I noticed
that my arm was really itching

27:30.941 --> 27:34.444
and I thought that it was because
I rubbed up against the brush.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.578
before I helped the fat kids with the ball.

27:43.662 --> 27:47.123
(STAMMERS) But, boy, thank goodness
it fell out here. That's great.

27:47.207 --> 27:50.001

would've fallen out there? Wow.

27:50.085 --> 27:52.628
Yeah, that's a lot of cash.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.505
Well, you know my suppliers deal in cash.

33:14.743 --> 33:17.328
I mean, if you don't tell your friend, your best friend,

33:17.412 --> 33:18.996
then you're basically banging her, too.

33:19.081 --> 33:22.375
Okay, come on, now. It depends. Is it the playoffs?

33:23.210 --> 33:24.752
Game seven, the championship.

33:25.212 --> 33:26.337
Championship.

33:26.421 --> 33:27.505
No, then I wouldn't tell him.

33:27.589 --> 33:28.798
Yeah, no way. No.

33:29.007 --> 33:31.884
Don't tell him. Nope. You wait. You wait.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.597
DIANE: Ronny, you never call to just "check in."

33:36.682 --> 33:39.433
You know what happened? I saw
this episode of Springer,

33:39.768 --> 33:42.395
and I just can't shake what happened on the episode.

33:42.479 --> 33:45.815
This woman found out that her best friend's
husband was cheating on her,

33:45.899 --> 33:47.483
and she did not tell her friend.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.110
Ronny, why are you telling me this?

33:49.444 --> 33:50.528
Bowling.

33:50.612 --> 33:52.238
I just want to get your take on it. What do you think?

33:52.322 --> 33:54.156
Do you think she should have told her best friend

33:54.241 --> 33:55.324
that her husband was cheating?

33:55.409 --> 33:57.034
Of course she should.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.744
But what about the whole "kill the messenger" thing?

33:58.787 --> 34:01.038
You know what I mean? Ronny,
she is doing her friend a favor.

34:01.123 --> 34:03.916
It doesn't matter how painful the moment...

34:04.459 --> 34:06.669
Mom, come on! Okay, Ronny, I got to go, I'm sorry.

34:06.753 --> 34:07.962
Okay. Bye-bye.

Nice disguise, Ronny.

34:19.433 --> 34:22.226
Making it a woman on Jerry Springer? Bullshit!

34:22.310 --> 34:23.853
I am not an idiot.

34:23.937 --> 34:24.978
What?

34:25.063 --> 34:27.481
You want to tell me Saul's cheating on me? Just say it!

34:27.607 --> 34:28.733
Diane, listen. I don't think you understand

34:28.817 --> 34:30.150
what I'm saying. I'm not saying anything about Saul.

34:30.277 --> 34:32.152
I'm gonna kill him! You don't need to kill anybody.

men who were basically Dad.

I mean, who would even sleep
with that out-of-work slob?

34:40.161 --> 34:42.663
Okay, Diane, listen to me, you're way overreacting.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.623
How dare you tell me something
like this over the phone?

34:45.708 --> 34:47.668
How dare you tell me this at all?

34:48.754 --> 34:50.880
And screw you, Ronny!

34:50.964 --> 34:53.632
You have always been a selfish little asshole.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.551

35:15.947 --> 35:17.072
Can I talk to you for a second?

35:17.157 --> 35:21.035
I was actually gonna run up here
for about the rest of the day.

I've been thinking too much about myself lately,

35:46.478 --> 35:49.772

a car is not loud enough.

So I have eight minutes.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.155
Eight minutes? Yeah.

Yeah, I have a call at 5:00, with
Helmut Farber in Berlin.

36:00.534 --> 36:02.326
He's going to give me some pointers
on throttle response.

honey. We're way behind.

guys are burning yourselves out.

I know you don't want to celebrate,

37:50.143 --> 37:51.435
because you guys haven't gotten a line yet.

much more than it needs to be.

43:36.531 --> 43:38.407
And now your stress is causing me stress.

43:38.491 --> 43:41.034
That's right, I'm stressing out like crazy. Yeah.

43:41.661 --> 43:42.953
You're right. You're totally right.

43:43.037 --> 43:46.206
Now that you verbalize it, and I hear
it, you're completely right, man.

43:46.582 --> 43:47.666
Thank you.

You ever get a massage?

43:59.053 --> 44:00.053
Hmm?

44:00.263 --> 44:04.016
In times like this, when it gets very
stressful, do you get a massage?

44:05.184 --> 44:07.811
Have I had a massage? I mean,
no, not really. Really, no.

44:07.895 --> 44:09.980
You can only do so much yourself.

44:10.064 --> 44:11.398
You can do things yourself,

44:11.482 --> 44:15.819
but when you get a professional
to get that, take it out of you

44:15.903 --> 44:19.531
and get that stress right out
of you, throw it out of you.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.867
Hey, Nick, you know what could be tremendous?

44:22.785 --> 44:24.745
Maybe me and you could go and
get a massage together.

44:24.912 --> 44:27.998
I don't mean in the same room or something.
I mean at the same place.

44:28.082 --> 44:29.291
Do you know a place we could do that?

44:29.375 --> 44:30.751
Where we could get a massage?

44:30.835 --> 44:33.378
A place that could take us to relax, relax, relax.

44:33.463 --> 44:35.881
Here's what I'm trying to say to you, okay?

44:35.965 --> 44:38.592
Don't let fear sabotage letting yourself be happy.

44:38.843 --> 44:41.094
You guys are great together. You're in love.

44:41.179 --> 44:45.265
And love can be very rewarding
and it can be very filling.

44:45.433 --> 44:46.892
Very filling.

44:47.101 --> 44:49.811
Like a warm stew. It honestly is.

44:50.521 --> 44:52.856
Look, if you want ice cream,

44:53.816 --> 44:56.234
go in the car and get ice cream.

44:56.319 --> 44:57.527
You don't worry that, "While I'm driving,

44:57.612 --> 44:59.112
"hey, I might have some chest pains,"

44:59.197 --> 45:01.156
and then, "Turns out, heart attack.
I'm having a heart attack!"

45:01.240 --> 45:04.034
You veer off, you kill a bunch of seniors and toddlers.

45:04.410 --> 45:06.161
You get your ice cream.

45:06.496 --> 45:09.414
And you know what? 99 % of the time, you're
gonna end up at the ice cream shop

45:09.499 --> 45:12.125
with a big hot fudge sundae. Nuts!

45:15.338 --> 45:18.799
Only one percent of the time do you kill the innocent.

45:20.301 --> 45:21.760
It's pretty good odds.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.388
I'm not understanding what you're trying to say to me.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.765
All right, Ronny.

46:04.095 --> 46:05.637

Yeah, well, keep at it.

I'm sorry?

46:57.732 --> 46:58.982

Go. No, I have things.

48:01.420 --> 48:03.004
You go. And you go, too.

48:35.037 --> 48:37.205
if you ever want to talk about anything, just like...

48:37.290 --> 48:38.415
There's nothing we can't talk about.

48:38.499 --> 48:39.499
Yeah, we can always talk.

maybe we could get a drink.

48:57.310 --> 49:00.228
that I've been thinking about what you were saying

49:00.354 --> 49:02.105
with the curtain and all that stuff.

I'm being fair to you during this,

two sides to every story.

Ronny, you followed him to the massage parlor?

(STAMMERS) Well, no, I just wanted
to call and let you know

49:16.120 --> 49:18.163
that I'm sure that not everything
that you're saying is bullshit.

49:18.247 --> 49:20.165
And that if there is complicated things

49:20.291 --> 49:23.376
that are going on, I really hope you guys work on it.

want to be in this, Geneva.

you go home tonight, honey.

to hear before you go and do that.

What is it?

50:20.101 --> 50:21.476
I ordered you some coffee.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.019
I don't need your goddamn coffee, Geneva,

50:23.104 --> 50:24.729
I don't have anything to talk to you about.

50:25.064 --> 50:27.023
I'm gonna go see Nick tonight,

50:27.108 --> 50:30.860
and I'm going to tell him that
his wife is sick and twisted,

50:31.654 --> 50:33.530
and that she's a liar.

50:33.989 --> 50:36.950
And I'm going to tell him that he's
married to goddamn Helen Keller.

50:38.744 --> 50:40.453
Helen Keller? Yeah.

You're a five-year-old on a playground, Ronald.

50:51.257 --> 50:53.133
It's not like I want to go and see Zip.

50:53.259 --> 50:57.303
But when my husband calls me to explain
he has another late meeting,

50:57.388 --> 50:59.139
it kind of just flies out the window.

50:59.223 --> 51:01.808
"Zip"? That's the guy's name, Zip?

51:01.892 --> 51:05.562
The point is, Ronny, I don't want any of this.

51:05.646 --> 51:06.855
I love my husband.

51:06.939 --> 51:08.356

51:08.441 --> 51:09.733
Stay out of my life.

51:09.817 --> 51:11.401
You're not a therapist.

51:11.485 --> 51:13.653
In fact, you need one, desperately.

51:14.405 --> 51:17.574
Look in the mirror. You're 40 years
old, you've never been married.

51:17.658 --> 51:19.534
Go fix yourself and then you can call me.

51:19.618 --> 51:20.618
I don't need to call you, I don't need

51:20.703 --> 51:21.745
to say anything to you anymore.

51:21.829 --> 51:24.831
All I need to do is get out of here and
go tell Nick that his wife is cheating.

51:24.915 --> 51:27.417
And I guess, because you weren't able to do

51:27.501 --> 51:30.086
the things that you really said you needed to do

51:30.171 --> 51:32.922
that that's just the way it's going
to have to go down, honey.

51:33.007 --> 51:36.092
You know what? I see it going down
just a little bit differently.

51:36.177 --> 51:37.677
Really? Yeah.

51:37.762 --> 51:40.388
Because I'm going to deny it.

51:40.473 --> 51:42.599
And then I'm going to say you made a pass at me.

51:42.683 --> 51:44.517
I made a pass at you? Yep.

51:45.603 --> 51:48.521
And considering our little secret,

51:48.606 --> 51:50.356
I'm pretty sure he'll believe me.

51:50.858 --> 51:52.859
Geneva, okay...

51:55.529 --> 51:57.697
We both decided not to say anything

51:57.782 --> 52:01.075
because you liked him, and we didn't
want to ruin something good

52:01.160 --> 52:02.577

52:02.661 --> 52:05.872
that happened three months before
you two ever started dating.

52:06.123 --> 52:08.333
But, Ronny, he doesn't know that.

52:08.793 --> 52:10.835
It didn't mean anything, Geneva.

52:11.212 --> 52:14.172
Yeah? Well, it means something now, doesn't it?

52:15.382 --> 52:18.802
See, you need to understand how
this is going to play out, Ronny.

52:18.886 --> 52:22.222
I'm going tell him how we slept
together all those years ago,

52:22.306 --> 52:25.517
and then I'm going to say that you
started making passes at me.

52:26.018 --> 52:28.561
And that they never stopped.

52:30.189 --> 52:31.481
You do that.

52:31.565 --> 52:35.568

on you for 20 years straight.

But Ronny insisted that we not say anything.

52:49.083 --> 52:52.418
But as the years went on, it got harder and harder

52:52.503 --> 52:56.422
and I just lied to myself and said it didn't matter.

Ronny has gone crazy!

He's been throwing me up against restaurant walls

53:07.226 --> 53:09.018
right when you're right around the corner.

53:09.103 --> 53:12.021
It's like he wants you to see, he wants to get caught

53:12.106 --> 53:15.108
because he feels so guilty.

53:15.609 --> 53:17.861
But I don't feel safe anymore, Nick!

53:17.945 --> 53:19.279
Okay.

53:19.363 --> 53:21.948
And this had to come out.

53:28.581 --> 53:30.790
Then what are you going to do, Ronny?

53:30.875 --> 53:32.792
Mr. Moral Guy.

53:33.294 --> 53:36.880
Are you going to look your best friend
in the eyes, and lie to him

53:36.964 --> 53:41.009
and say, "No, that never happened.
I never slept with her"?

53:41.093 --> 53:43.261
I don't think so.

53:45.723 --> 53:49.934
Stay out of my marriage.

when things were tough.

with those for my own good

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:49.518
What happened to your face?

01:09:49.602 --> 01:09:51.395
Just a bar fight.

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:55.107
Just a bar fight. Some bikers...

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.151
Bar fight, Ronny? Really?

01:09:58.236 --> 01:09:59.653
Yeah.

01:09:59.737 --> 01:10:03.198
I was at the Zip Bar and Grill, actually.

01:10:03.283 --> 01:10:04.700
Real dirtbag joint.

01:10:04.784 --> 01:10:06.827
Do not go there. Take it off the GPS.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:08.370
Let's do this. Where's the fam?

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:11.039
You know what? I got to talk to
you for a second. Come here.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.291
Should I see the family?

01:10:13.459 --> 01:10:14.877
Okay.

01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:16.044
NICK: (WHISPERS) What is all this?

01:10:16.129 --> 01:10:19.965
Come over here. Look, obviously,
something's going on with you.

01:10:20.300 --> 01:10:24.469
And I want you to know that if you
need me, for anything at all...

01:10:25.263 --> 01:10:27.180
Screw the project, screw the deadline.

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:30.017
I'm there for you, all right?

01:10:30.101 --> 01:10:31.143
Ronny...

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:34.062
Whoa! You look like shit. Thank you.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:36.189
Anyway, thank you.

01:10:37.859 --> 01:10:42.446
I pressed Saul and he totally caved,
admitted he was cheating.

01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:47.284
Now we're going to work on it, for the kids.

01:10:47.368 --> 01:10:49.536
It might be futile, but you got to at least try, right?

01:10:49.621 --> 01:10:51.914
And all those times he was saying,
"I'm going bowling."

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:53.248
Yeah, he wasn't bowling.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:55.751
He wasn't even bowling at all.

01:10:55.835 --> 01:10:57.252
Ronny? What the...

01:10:57.337 --> 01:10:58.629
Ron?

01:10:58.755 --> 01:10:59.922
(LAUGHING)

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:02.257
(GRUNTS)

01:11:02.342 --> 01:11:03.508
Get a good feel, buddy?

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:04.635
Ronny!

01:11:06.012 --> 01:11:08.472
You remember my cousin James,

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:10.974
and his boyfriend Juan?

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:14.937
Let me finish.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:19.066
Because families like to touch and hang
out, and that's what we're doing.

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.609
I'm just roughing it up with my guy!

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.736
Come on, I had him! I had him, Juan!

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.906
Nice to meet you, buddy! My
guy, good to see you, babe!

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.824
And my parents.

01:11:28.368 --> 01:11:29.701
Ronald.

01:11:30.203 --> 01:11:32.913
Yeah, Burt and Sue.

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:35.958
It's impressive, 40 years, it's quite an accomplishment.

01:11:36.042 --> 01:11:38.210
Is the flame still burning after 40?

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:39.962
Still there.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.004
Of course it is, of course it is.

01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:42.506
With you, there's no question. My man.

01:11:42.590 --> 01:11:43.966
Let's go celebrate. Let's do this.

01:11:44.050 --> 01:11:46.134
I'm just playing the fun part, doing the things I do.

01:11:46.219 --> 01:11:48.095
Great to see you!

01:11:48.596 --> 01:11:50.430
Breath against breath,

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:52.516
breathe me life.

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:58.480
Thousand and thousand kisses, give me, I beg you.

01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:02.985
Love wants everything without condition.

01:12:03.069 --> 01:12:06.321
Love has no law.

01:12:07.281 --> 01:12:09.366
Mom and Dad,

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:12.577
your love has no law.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.538
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.504
So beautiful.

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:28.969
I'd like to make the toast.

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:34.975
Forty years.

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:39.813
That is a long time to be with
someone. Forty years, wow!

01:12:41.941 --> 01:12:43.608
It's impressive.

01:12:43.943 --> 01:12:47.446
I personally don't know a lot about marriage,

01:12:48.448 --> 01:12:51.700
but I would imagine it can't be easy,

01:12:51.784 --> 01:12:53.744
all those 40 years being with someone.

01:12:53.828 --> 01:12:56.872
Because people are not perfect.

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:59.374
People make mistakes in life.

01:12:59.459 --> 01:13:01.376
But I would assume

01:13:01.461 --> 01:13:06.339
what would get you through those 40 years would be...

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:08.508
...honesty.

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:13.847
Honesty and honesty alone.

01:13:14.307 --> 01:13:16.141
And love.

01:13:16.309 --> 01:13:19.853
But even more than that, Burt, is the honesty.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.647
SUE: Don't forget about patience.

01:13:22.815 --> 01:13:25.734
Oh, no one's going to forget about patience, Sue.

01:13:25.818 --> 01:13:27.736
You can relax, patience is on the table.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.489
(CHUCKLES) What I'm talking about,
though, is honesty here.

01:13:31.491 --> 01:13:33.533
Talking about two people

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:37.245
who have probably had an eye
wander every now and then.

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:39.748
Everyone knows Burt was in the garment business.

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:41.792
If you don't think you meet a
lot of girls in that business,

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:43.460
then you don't get out of the house much.

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:45.128
A lot of girls.

01:13:45.213 --> 01:13:46.505
A lot.

01:13:46.881 --> 01:13:48.840
Good-looking guy, well-spoken.

01:13:49.383 --> 01:13:51.760
It's "pinch me, I'm dreaming time," am I right, ladies?

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:55.764
And look at Sue. Gorgeous lady, easy to be around.

01:13:56.265 --> 01:13:57.933
Always into the aerobics.

01:13:58.017 --> 01:14:00.102
Kept it tight, in a great way.

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:04.106
And Burt did well, they have
a pool. Pool guy come over.

01:14:04.190 --> 01:14:06.316
Lot of guys would come over to
the house. Young guys, too.

01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.943
Now let's say something did happen.

01:14:08.027 --> 01:14:09.486
We don't know that it did, maybe it didn't.

01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:11.279
But it's not up to us to know, it's up to them to know.

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.656
I bet they were honest with each other.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:14.783
I bet she came to him and said, "Hey, Burt,

01:14:14.867 --> 01:14:15.951
"you know you're my number one.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:19.496
"But maybe Mama got thirsty last night."

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.039
(GASPS)

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:25.085
What I'm going to focus on, though,
here is the ingredient

01:14:25.169 --> 01:14:29.256
that I think really makes the whole stew
stick together, and that is honesty.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.050
And similar interests!

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:33.802
Who are you?

01:14:34.554 --> 01:14:36.054
I'm Cousin Betty.

01:14:36.514 --> 01:14:37.556
First?

01:14:38.224 --> 01:14:39.349
Second.

01:14:39.433 --> 01:14:43.228
Okay, Cousin Betty, this is not a group toast

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:44.688
nor is it an open forum.

01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:46.022
I'm the one who's standing up here.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:48.108
I'm the one with the glass, I'm the one that is talking.

01:14:48.192 --> 01:14:49.609
Now, Burt and Sue chime in

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:52.946
and that's fine because it's their night,
you know, 40 years and all of that.

01:14:53.030 --> 01:14:54.072
But not you.

01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:57.325
Nobody gave you a speaking part, nobody cares.

01:14:58.911 --> 01:15:01.997
You're a second cousin, which isn't even a real relative

01:15:02.081 --> 01:15:04.082
because someone could have sex with a second cousin

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:05.458
and the kid could still be normal.

01:15:10.131 --> 01:15:12.299
Honesty.

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:16.094
You cannot run from it.

01:15:17.471 --> 01:15:18.555
And believe me,

01:15:21.267 --> 01:15:22.475
it'll find you.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:27.856
The truth will always find you.

01:15:31.903 --> 01:15:33.945
Burt and Sue.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.947
Forty years, being honest.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:37.908
ALL: Burt and Sue.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:39.451
Congratulations.

01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:43.038
(WHISPERS) Can I speak to you in the kitchen?

01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:44.873
I was just going to finish my... Please?

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:47.042
Sure. Okay.

01:16:01.515 --> 01:16:03.058
I need to know what's going on.

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:04.309
Nothing.

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.311
I'm just toasting, and I'm passionate about honesty.

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:09.147
I'm not talking about the inappropriate toast

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.107
that you just gave at my parents' anniversary,

01:16:11.192 --> 01:16:12.317
or the bar fight,

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:16.363
or the allergies that you caught from
street plants while chasing fat kids.

01:16:16.447 --> 01:16:17.697
I'm talking about

01:16:17.782 --> 01:16:20.575
what's going on in your head
that's causing these things.

01:16:23.329 --> 01:16:26.289
It's just some stuff that I have to fix.

01:16:26.374 --> 01:16:28.667
That's it, honey. And I can't bring you in on it

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:32.295
because that would directly affect my ability to do that.

01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:34.047
To do what? To fix it!

01:16:34.131 --> 01:16:35.715
Fix it, fix it!

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:37.592
I have to fix it on my own, honey.

01:16:37.677 --> 01:16:41.304
Okay, Ronny, you're not fixing anything

01:16:41.389 --> 01:16:42.931
and you're breaking more stuff.

01:16:43.724 --> 01:16:46.059
And it's enough!

01:16:46.477 --> 01:16:48.812
You just gave a whole speech about honesty,

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:51.064
it's time for you to be honest with me!

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:52.983
Is it? Yeah.

01:16:53.067 --> 01:16:54.526
Is it honest time now, between us?

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:57.112
Then why don't you start, Beth?

01:16:57.196 --> 01:16:59.322
Why don't you tell me about the Kearny Group?

01:17:00.324 --> 01:17:01.992
(NERVOUS CHUCKLING EXHALE)

01:17:02.076 --> 01:17:03.743
How do you know about the Kearny Group?

01:17:03.828 --> 01:17:05.328
Are you going to Las Vegas?

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.372
Are you planning on leaving me?

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:10.667
God, Ronny, no! No!

01:17:13.045 --> 01:17:17.924
They asked me to open up a restaurant
in City Center, and I said no.

01:17:18.009 --> 01:17:19.551
Why?

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:23.263
Because that would mean I'd have to go live

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:25.265
in Las Vegas for a couple of years.

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.600
And...

01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:31.813
And what, Beth?

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:38.737
And I don't trust you in Las Vegas.

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:41.197
Okay.

01:17:43.534 --> 01:17:45.035
Ronny...

01:17:46.037 --> 01:17:47.287
Look at you.

01:17:48.039 --> 01:17:49.748
Your sponsor called me.

01:17:49.832 --> 01:17:51.750
You haven't been going to your meetings,

01:17:51.834 --> 01:17:54.794
you're walking around with large amounts of cash,

01:17:54.879 --> 01:17:58.381
and it just really feels like two years ago.

01:17:58.466 --> 01:18:00.008
You know, I...

01:18:02.053 --> 01:18:03.803
I can't get into this with you right now.

01:18:03.888 --> 01:18:07.599
If you don't let me in, how do I know what to do?

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:08.975
How can I help you?

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:11.603
I think it's best if I go.

01:18:12.271 --> 01:18:14.105
I don't want you to go.

01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:23.198
I'm going to go sleep at the office tonight.

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:25.825
You want to do this?

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.642
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.897
What are you doing?

01:18:55.981 --> 01:18:57.857
(WHISPERING) Watching you sleep.

01:18:57.942 --> 01:18:59.901
It's creepy, right?

01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:03.029
Felix, go play with the hot tub and
the ladies on the line, honestly.

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:05.573
I'm just getting up, it's too much. You're too much.

01:19:05.658 --> 01:19:08.284
Please, give me a minute, I don't know where I'm at.

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.882
Oh, God. Hey, man. What's going on?

01:19:22.967 --> 01:19:24.217
Come on in the house.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:25.343
What, are you going to shoot me right here

01:19:25.428 --> 01:19:26.469
on your porch in broad daylight?

01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:27.679
Are you out of your mind?

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.222
No, not if you're in the house.

01:19:29.682 --> 01:19:30.932
I've googled this.

01:19:31.016 --> 01:19:33.977
Do you want to know how it works? Yeah?

01:19:34.061 --> 01:19:36.104
You come inside and I defend myself.

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:38.064
Now, I'm not going to pump six bullets into you.

01:19:38.149 --> 01:19:41.151
No, that would make me look crazy and out of control.

01:19:41.235 --> 01:19:44.779
No, I'm going to pump three into you
like a calm gun-owner would.

01:19:44.864 --> 01:19:48.074
Zip, I came here with the intent, and only the intent,

01:19:48.159 --> 01:19:49.659
of getting my camera back.

01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:53.246
(STUTTERS) Oh, yeah. Your camera?

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:56.082
Come on inside.

01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:58.126
If you just want your camera, it's right here.

01:19:58.210 --> 01:19:59.294
Listen to me.

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:00.962
I can really appreciate the fact that things got

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:02.797
completely nuts the other night.

01:20:02.882 --> 01:20:05.467
And I can also appreciate that a lot of your property...

01:20:05.551 --> 01:20:08.428
I appreciate the fact that a lot of your
property got damaged as well.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.598
(VOICE BREAKING) You killed my fish.

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:13.808
You killed my fish, man. I know.

01:20:13.893 --> 01:20:15.143
Why would you do that?

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:16.978
Maybe you should be compensated for that.

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:18.605
You should be compensated for that.

01:20:18.689 --> 01:20:21.149
I can't put a price on that, because that's a friend.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:23.359
Although you can't pet it, but what would the fish do?

01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:25.028
The fish doesn't want this, man.

01:20:25.112 --> 01:20:28.490
I think what the fish is saying is maybe
I should get my camera back.

01:20:28.574 --> 01:20:31.784
And maybe, just maybe, and I'm
just hoping against hope here,

01:20:31.869 --> 01:20:34.078
maybe we can put this whole thing behind us.

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:36.039
$10,000.

01:20:37.708 --> 01:20:38.875
$500.

01:20:39.418 --> 01:20:40.502
$5,000.

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:43.421
I have a thousand. I'll give you the thousand.

01:20:44.590 --> 01:20:45.882
And an apology.

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:50.303
Zip, if I apologize to you when you
have a gun pointed at my throat,

01:20:50.387 --> 01:20:52.764
then I don't think it really counts. (CHUCKLES)

01:20:53.641 --> 01:20:55.308
That's a good point.

01:20:56.310 --> 01:20:59.521
I'm sorry for what happened.

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:00.897
I need to feel it.

01:21:02.066 --> 01:21:06.361
I just need it to really come from right there.

01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:08.696
Look, man, I'm sorry, all right?

01:21:08.781 --> 01:21:11.032
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

01:21:11.116 --> 01:21:15.828
I'm really, really sorry that we're
standing here in this situation.

01:21:17.248 --> 01:21:18.456
I'm sorry.

01:21:26.465 --> 01:21:27.549
Okay.

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.104
(SIGHING)

01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:46.401
...seven, eight, nine, 10.

01:21:46.485 --> 01:21:50.363
And the $400 I owe for the old person's home. Perfect.

01:21:55.536 --> 01:21:57.704
You did this to me.

01:21:57.788 --> 01:21:58.997
You know that.

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:02.458
I don't mess with firearms. I don't do that.

01:22:02.543 --> 01:22:05.169
I don't do that. Look, I'm a sensitive guy.

01:22:05.546 --> 01:22:07.338
You know what I'm saying to you?

01:22:08.132 --> 01:22:09.340
Okay.

01:22:13.178 --> 01:22:14.345
Thank you.

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:20.643
Drive safe.

01:22:26.650 --> 01:22:28.276
(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

01:22:36.744 --> 01:22:38.828
Who the hell are you?

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:46.502
You got no choice now.

01:22:46.587 --> 01:22:49.005
You got to go right up to him and just say it to him.

01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:51.341
It's not that complicated of a thing to do. It's easy.

01:22:51.425 --> 01:22:54.802
You got the pictures, she can't bullshit
you, and that's the end of it.

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:58.181
Come here. Get in here, I love you.

01:22:58.265 --> 01:23:00.475
Stop it, you will find somebody else.

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:02.435
You're a great guy, and I love you.

01:23:02.519 --> 01:23:04.354
Just keep walking.

01:23:28.379 --> 01:23:29.420
Ronny.

01:23:30.964 --> 01:23:32.382
Hey.

01:23:39.765 --> 01:23:41.683
We were just about to call you, actually.

01:23:41.767 --> 01:23:44.352
We were hoping to be a little
better prepared, but I guess

01:23:44.436 --> 01:23:45.687
we can start?

01:23:45.771 --> 01:23:47.689
Ronny, why don't you come join us?

01:23:47.773 --> 01:23:48.773
Who are you?

01:23:48.857 --> 01:23:50.400
My name is Dr. Rosenstone.

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:53.903
Your family and friends are here
because they love you, Ronald.

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:56.989
And they can't stand to see you
destroy yourself anymore.

01:23:57.074 --> 01:23:58.533
What is this, an intervention?

01:23:58.617 --> 01:23:59.784
(CRYING) Yes!

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:02.245
ROSENSTONE: We don't see the need for labels.

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:05.206
This is just a bunch of friends talking to one friend

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:06.708
and letting them know they love them.

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:07.834
An intervention.

01:24:07.918 --> 01:24:10.253
Your sister and her husband would like to start.

01:24:10.921 --> 01:24:13.548
I tormented you, I know.

01:24:13.632 --> 01:24:15.007
Diane, please don't do this.

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:16.718
I dressed you up like a little girl,

01:24:16.802 --> 01:24:18.469
but I'm here to support you.

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:20.221
DIANE: Ronny, I am!

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.640
Okay, okay. It's not what you think.

01:24:24.643 --> 01:24:27.061
(WHISPERING) I don't know
how the hell you found out,

01:24:27.146 --> 01:24:29.313
but I'll kill you if you ever do that to me again.

01:24:29.398 --> 01:24:30.398
Okay.

BETH: Why don't we all come in and sit down?

01:24:33.819 --> 01:24:34.861
Come on.

01:24:34.945 --> 01:24:36.070
Let Ronny sit down.

01:24:38.490 --> 01:24:40.700
DIANE: We got a big blue chair waiting for Ronny.

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:43.244
Come on, sweetheart, sit down. It'll be okay.

01:24:43.662 --> 01:24:46.330
ROSENSTONE: Well, it's no coincidence

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:50.042
that we find ourselves here in
a gentle circle of support.

01:24:50.127 --> 01:24:51.252
Hey.

01:24:52.421 --> 01:24:54.255
Oh, shit, am I late?

01:24:56.133 --> 01:25:00.094
I'm sorry. I know it's probably really bad
form to be late to an intervention.

Hi, I'm Beth.

01:25:01.221 --> 01:25:02.764
Hi, Beth. What's going on?

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:03.931
Hey, big guy.

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:05.349
Who the hell invited him?

01:25:05.434 --> 01:25:07.059
NICK: You know what? I invited him.

01:25:07.144 --> 01:25:08.561
You did? You invited him?

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:11.939
Yeah. You know what? I followed
you to his place earlier today.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:15.943
I saw you pay him.

01:25:16.862 --> 01:25:18.863
And after you left, I went up and talked
to him. (MESSAGE TONE BEEPS)

01:25:18.947 --> 01:25:20.031
It says right here,

01:25:21.658 --> 01:25:25.453
"If possible, it's best to have all enablers present,

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.246
"even bookies."

01:25:27.331 --> 01:25:31.250
So I agreed to pay your debt if he agreed
to come here tonight, and he did.

01:25:31.335 --> 01:25:32.460
Thanks, man. I appreciate this.

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:34.045
It was really nice of you. No problem.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:35.546
You got to be kidding me.

01:25:35.631 --> 01:25:37.048

01:25:38.801 --> 01:25:42.011
Admit it, man. You bet on everything.

How dare you show up here! You
have no right being here!

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:48.434
He's a scumbag, an enabler, a mistake!

01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:50.478
NICK: Stop it! I asked him to come here!

01:25:50.562 --> 01:25:51.938
Come on, don't kill the messenger.

01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:53.272

01:25:55.192 --> 01:25:58.277
Look, he bets on the Bulls, and the Sox,

01:25:58.362 --> 01:25:59.445
the Cubs.

01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:01.322
He bet on the Hawaii game.

01:26:01.406 --> 01:26:03.157
Only degenerates bet on the Hawaii game.

01:26:03.242 --> 01:26:04.617
I don't want that for you, man.

01:26:06.286 --> 01:26:08.204
I should have done this a long time ago.

01:26:12.251 --> 01:26:14.418
I think you need to take a look at this.

(CAMERA BUTTON CLICKS)

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:26.055
What is... You got to look, there's more pictures.

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:27.849
You got to flip through that one,
get to the other pictures.

01:26:27.933 --> 01:26:29.016
I did. I'm flipping right now.

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:30.643
I keep flipping, and it keeps going back to the same pic

01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:32.687
because there's only one picture in the catalogue.

01:26:39.903 --> 01:26:41.988
You can't take a picture of something
that didn't happen, Ronald.

01:26:42.072 --> 01:26:44.073
Son of a bitch. DIANE: (GASPS) Ronny!

01:26:44.157 --> 01:26:45.199
Not again.

You son of a bitch!

01:26:53.292 --> 01:26:54.584
What is wrong with you?

01:26:54.668 --> 01:26:57.044
You're completely out of control!

01:26:57.129 --> 01:26:58.546
You're crazy!

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.631
You're completely out of your mind!

01:27:00.716 --> 01:27:04.510
Don't get me wrong, I'd like to party
with you and get high with you,

01:27:04.595 --> 01:27:05.928
but you're insane!

01:27:11.184 --> 01:27:13.519
I think we're missing the point of this gathering.

01:27:13.604 --> 01:27:15.938
It's about talking and sharing our concerns.

01:27:16.023 --> 01:27:17.273
This is ridiculous.

01:27:17.357 --> 01:27:19.400

I have something to say.

01:27:24.698 --> 01:27:26.032
Please, just let me... Please, okay?

01:27:26.992 --> 01:27:28.117
All right.

01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:29.619
Ah, man, that was...

01:27:30.913 --> 01:27:33.372
All right, I got something to say.

01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:37.793
This is important to me, so... (CLEARS THROAT)

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:39.086
Okay, Nick...

01:27:39.171 --> 01:27:41.839
All right, please. Please?

01:27:43.258 --> 01:27:47.637
I didn't have many friends when I got to Ball State.

01:27:47.971 --> 01:27:50.473
I was shy and...

01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:54.852
You already know this.

01:27:57.189 --> 01:28:01.025
But, Ronny, what you don't know is

01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:05.780
when you moved in across the
hall, in second semester,

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:08.074
I made it a goal of mine

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:11.160
to become friends with you.

01:28:11.244 --> 01:28:14.330
I mean, you were funny and charming,

01:28:14.414 --> 01:28:16.540
and everybody liked him, everybody.

01:28:16.625 --> 01:28:19.502
Okay, Nick, enough.

01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:21.963
You got to let me talk here for a second.

01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:25.257
I want you to listen to me.

01:28:25.676 --> 01:28:27.969
Nick, you're my best friend.

01:28:28.637 --> 01:28:30.763
You always make me do better.

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:34.517
You always make sure I don't screw up.

01:28:34.601 --> 01:28:39.438
And you make it that I never forget
what really matters in life.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.858
When I had my relapse two years ago,

01:28:42.943 --> 01:28:47.279
it wasn't all the money and stuff that
I lost that made me feel bad.

01:28:47.906 --> 01:28:49.824
It was the fact that I let you down.

01:28:49.908 --> 01:28:51.283
ROSENSTONE: This is good.

01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:52.660
This is catharsis.

01:28:52.744 --> 01:28:53.953
I know.

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:57.164
You know I never had a brother growing up, right?

01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:05.548
And my dad wasn't around very much.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:10.386
And all my friends growing up were, really, criminals.

01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:14.974
So when I met you in school, I was...

01:29:15.892 --> 01:29:20.896
Let's just say that I looked up
to you as well, in college.

01:29:23.692 --> 01:29:27.111
And I really have looked up to you ever since.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:29.697
So, there's something that you should know.

01:29:29.781 --> 01:29:32.158
There's something that I already
should have told you, Nick.

01:29:33.118 --> 01:29:34.326
What is it?

01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:36.412
Geneva's been running on you

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:38.539
with the guy that you thought was my bookie.

01:29:39.041 --> 01:29:41.167
Jesus Christ, Ronny!

01:29:41.251 --> 01:29:43.252
You thought that you saw an exchange, right?

01:29:43.336 --> 01:29:44.712
That it was a gambling exchange,

01:29:44.796 --> 01:29:45.880
but it wasn't a gambling exchange.

01:29:45.964 --> 01:29:47.798
Really, I was just going to get my camera,

01:29:47.883 --> 01:29:49.341
because there were pictures and stuff on it.

01:29:50.177 --> 01:29:51.927
The truth is, I'm not gambling.

01:29:52.012 --> 01:29:53.846
I haven't been doing any gambling at all.

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:55.556
What's been going on with me is

01:29:55.640 --> 01:29:59.351
I've really been trying to figure out
what's the best way to tell you

01:29:59.436 --> 01:30:01.312
and how to handle this thing.

01:30:02.314 --> 01:30:03.397
Is this true?

01:30:03.482 --> 01:30:05.775
No! It's not true.

01:30:05.859 --> 01:30:06.942
He's lying!

01:30:07.027 --> 01:30:08.861
He's compulsive, he's a gambler.

01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:11.155
He'll say anything, he's desperate!

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.615
Go ahead, Geneva, tell him the truth.

01:30:12.699 --> 01:30:14.075
Everyone is sitting here, listening.

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:15.951
Okay, fine, fine!

01:30:16.495 --> 01:30:17.661
Uh...

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:19.830
The thing is, that...

01:30:27.130 --> 01:30:29.048

01:30:33.553 --> 01:30:34.929
What did you expect?

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:37.389
You were getting happy endings in Pilsen.

01:30:37.474 --> 01:30:38.474
Jeez!

01:30:39.810 --> 01:30:42.311
No! No, Nick, listen.

01:30:42.395 --> 01:30:45.147
You left me alone. I wanted to be with you, but...

01:30:45.232 --> 01:30:46.440
Can we not get into this right now?

01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:47.775
No, but that's the problem!

01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:50.277
You never want to talk about anything, ever!

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:54.573
I know that it's been tough with us for a while now,

01:30:54.658 --> 01:30:56.784
and I take my part in that.

01:30:56.868 --> 01:31:00.913
But isn't there something about us you still believe in?

How long did you know?

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:09.922
I've known for a few days, a week. For way too long.

01:31:10.006 --> 01:31:12.842
I don't know what to say. I don't even
know what I'm feeling right now.

01:31:13.426 --> 01:31:15.469
Honestly, I don't know!

01:31:15.929 --> 01:31:17.930
I do know this, you should have
told me sooner, Ronny.

01:31:18.014 --> 01:31:19.473
Before right now.

01:31:19.558 --> 01:31:22.935

and your family, and Doctor...

with "Rose." Rosenstone.

...stone. Buddy, I know.

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:30.109
I'm really sorry. I tried to tell you in the office.

01:31:30.193 --> 01:31:31.986
What do you mean trying? Trying is not telling, Ronny!

01:31:32.696 --> 01:31:35.739
Come on. Look, I can appreciate

01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:39.160
how hard this must have been on you, I know.

01:31:39.244 --> 01:31:41.871
I'm just really glad that you say that
you can appreciate how hard it was

01:31:41.955 --> 01:31:43.247
because you don't even know.

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:45.583
I've been fighting with these people,

01:31:45.667 --> 01:31:47.585
trying to keep everything straight in my head.

01:31:47.669 --> 01:31:48.669
NICK: I get it.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:50.921
RONNY: But in the nature of what's going on here,

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:54.592
there's one more small thing that I
just want to bring closure to now

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:57.178
in the circle of gentleness.

01:31:57.262 --> 01:31:58.846
Ronny, you don't have to.

01:32:00.223 --> 01:32:01.640
Yes, I do, Geneva.

01:32:02.017 --> 01:32:03.726
Because Nick is my best friend.

01:32:03.810 --> 01:32:06.312
And this is what best friends do.

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:09.148
They tell the truth to each other.

01:32:12.152 --> 01:32:14.695
Okay. When we were in college,

01:32:14.779 --> 01:32:17.364
and this is way before you guys ever met,

01:32:17.574 --> 01:32:20.034
there was a night that didn't mean anything.
It was a meaningless night.

01:32:20.118 --> 01:32:21.452
It was a booze night.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:23.704
It was big, big bar night.

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:25.206
Ronny, get to the point.

01:32:25.290 --> 01:32:27.499
The point is, way before you guys ever met,

01:32:27.584 --> 01:32:29.418
before you ever even knew each other,

01:32:29.502 --> 01:32:30.794
I kind of slept with Geneva.

01:32:30.879 --> 01:32:31.921
You what?

01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:33.756
This is what friends do, they tell the truth.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:36.592
I'm a friend and I'm telling the
truth, buddy. Here I am.

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:38.344
GENEVA: He wanted to tell you, Nick.

01:32:38.428 --> 01:32:40.012
But I was falling in love with you.

01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:41.513
We didn't want to hurt you.

01:32:41.598 --> 01:32:43.474
You asshole! Hold on, hold on.

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:45.100
I'm telling the truth, I'm in a circle.

01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:47.228
No, you know what? You're the worst.

01:32:48.063 --> 01:32:49.980
Buddy, I'm sorry, okay? Listen...

01:32:50.065 --> 01:32:51.732
Get your hands off me. Don't touch me!

01:32:52.234 --> 01:32:53.651
Let me tell you something.

01:32:53.735 --> 01:32:55.694
That's probably the most honest
thing you've ever said to me.

01:32:55.779 --> 01:32:57.112
Nick... You're sorry.

01:32:57.197 --> 01:32:58.572
You're so sorry.

01:33:05.914 --> 01:33:07.581
I'm sorry, Ronny.

I'm sorry.

01:33:09.960 --> 01:33:13.337
I should never have put you in that position.

tension between you two.

01:34:23.783 --> 01:34:25.534
I didn't gamble.

01:34:27.912 --> 01:34:31.540
I walked by the casino once or
twice, but I didn't gamble.

01:34:36.796 --> 01:34:38.797
Are you okay?

01:34:41.009 --> 01:34:43.218
It's been a long day.

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:49.933
I didn't know if you had eaten or not, so,

01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:52.936
if you're hungry...

01:35:05.617 --> 01:35:06.867
(EXHALES)

01:35:11.956 --> 01:35:14.291
I don't know how to start this.

01:35:16.961 --> 01:35:19.129
I got scared.

01:35:19.631 --> 01:35:22.508
And I'm sorry,

01:35:22.592 --> 01:35:25.969
because I didn't feel safe.

01:35:26.054 --> 01:35:29.556
So then, I didn't tell you about Las
Vegas and the Kearny Group.

01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:32.726
And then, here I am, being someone
that I don't want to be.

01:35:32.811 --> 01:35:37.564
I mean, I staged this whole
ridiculous intervention thing

01:35:37.649 --> 01:35:40.651
(CRYING) and you weren't even gambling!

01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:44.029
And that's great, by the way.

01:35:44.114 --> 01:35:47.533
I'm so happy that you weren't gambling.

01:35:47.617 --> 01:35:50.869
But this is no good.

01:35:50.954 --> 01:35:53.247
It's not healthy.

01:35:53.331 --> 01:35:56.875
The problem is, if you don't share stuff with me,

01:35:56.960 --> 01:36:00.587
like the fact that you were with Geneva,
it keeps me in the dark.

01:36:00.672 --> 01:36:02.923
And that belittles us.

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:06.343
I want us to be more than that.

01:36:06.719 --> 01:36:08.387
I understand.

01:36:12.142 --> 01:36:14.268
I just didn't feel right in saying something to you

01:36:14.352 --> 01:36:15.769
if I wasn't saying it to Nick.

01:36:15.854 --> 01:36:18.689
And then, when I found out

01:36:19.315 --> 01:36:20.941
about the Vegas deal

01:36:21.025 --> 01:36:23.152
and that you didn't trust me enough
to share that with me,

01:36:23.236 --> 01:36:25.487
then that really hurt.

01:36:25.572 --> 01:36:29.199
But I guess I've earned that.

01:36:31.494 --> 01:36:34.204
And it's up to me to un-earn that.

01:36:34.998 --> 01:36:38.542
I don't ever want to put you through
anything like this ever again.

to get past this thing, okay?

you didn't want to hurt me,

room, I think we need to...

01:42:05.369 --> 01:42:08.371
Oh, that? We're like kids in a
car too long on a road trip.

01:42:08.456 --> 01:42:11.166
We're fine, we're just working.

01:42:20.718 --> 01:42:23.136
The moment of truth

01:42:23.221 --> 01:42:24.888
has finally arrived.

01:42:25.765 --> 01:42:30.769
Now I know that the journey getting
here has had some turbulence

01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:33.688
and some confusion.

01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:35.607
But I ask you for one second,

01:42:35.691 --> 01:42:40.612
when folks were reaching for greatness,
was that not the case?

01:42:40.696 --> 01:42:43.490
I remember a group of people
who wanted to head west

01:42:43.574 --> 01:42:48.036
with dreams of gold and opportunity.

01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.204
The Donner Party.

01:42:49.288 --> 01:42:51.122
The Donner Pass.

01:42:52.750 --> 01:42:55.418
Things got a little weird out on the trail, didn't it?

01:42:55.503 --> 01:42:57.087
(COYOTE HOWLING)

01:42:57.421 --> 01:42:59.798
Some cannibalism, folks got hungry.

01:43:01.092 --> 01:43:02.551
Some feelings hurt, some families destroyed,

01:43:02.635 --> 01:43:03.969
but some people made it out west.

01:43:04.053 --> 01:43:05.303
Not all of them.

01:43:05.388 --> 01:43:07.931
And it's not that they necessarily got rich.

01:43:09.976 --> 01:43:11.726
But the point is,

01:43:11.811 --> 01:43:14.479
we've headed out west, and this is our destination.

01:43:14.981 --> 01:43:16.022
Nick,

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.441
start your engine.

01:43:20.111 --> 01:43:21.152
(CAR ENGINE STARTING)

01:43:21.237 --> 01:43:22.654
(ENGINE PURRING)

01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:36.042
(CAR ENGINE ROARING)

01:43:46.262 --> 01:43:47.762
You son of a bitch.

01:44:05.865 --> 01:44:07.365
(TURNS OFF ENGINE)

01:44:07.450 --> 01:44:09.200
I told you the difference was Nick Brannen,

01:44:09.285 --> 01:44:11.745
and we have Nick Brannen.

01:44:11.829 --> 01:44:13.413
(SINGING) Simply the best

01:44:13.497 --> 01:44:14.748
You can feel it.

01:44:14.832 --> 01:44:17.167
(SINGING) Better than all the rest

01:44:19.503 --> 01:44:21.463
You were right about these lunatics, Susan.

01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:24.132
Commit to the long-term deal and cut them a check.

01:44:24.216 --> 01:44:26.217
(LAUGHS) And that's why I love you guys!

01:44:26.302 --> 01:44:27.636
That's why I love you!

01:44:27.720 --> 01:44:30.263
That's why my lady wood is still strong!

01:44:30.348 --> 01:44:32.098
See, I get it. They don't get it.

01:44:32.183 --> 01:44:33.558
They don't get it, but I do.

01:44:33.643 --> 01:44:36.436
See, all that fighting and shit, that's just passion!

01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.396
When you work that close, you just want to choke

01:44:38.481 --> 01:44:39.981
the hell out of somebody, right?

01:44:40.066 --> 01:44:41.399
Yeah. See, I understand that.

01:44:41.484 --> 01:44:42.984
I relate. But, listen.

01:44:43.069 --> 01:44:44.653
That motor...

01:44:44.737 --> 01:44:46.613
That motor in that car...

01:44:46.739 --> 01:44:49.699
I mean, when it started vibrating... I'm sorry?

01:44:49.825 --> 01:44:51.910
If I was sitting on the hood of that car... Okay.

01:44:51.994 --> 01:44:53.745
...and the way it was just vibrating...

01:44:53.829 --> 01:44:56.581
I understand, and I got to be really honest with you.

01:44:56.666 --> 01:44:59.084
When I first met you, your phraseology
with "lady wood,"

01:44:59.168 --> 01:45:01.670
I didn't know whether you were coming or going.

01:45:02.713 --> 01:45:04.714
But I've really grown to love you.

01:45:04.799 --> 01:45:06.299
(SUSAN LAUGHING)

01:45:06.801 --> 01:45:08.468
(CROWD CHEERING)

01:45:13.015 --> 01:45:14.724
Yes! Yes! Come on! Come on!

01:45:16.060 --> 01:45:17.102
Damn it!

01:45:17.186 --> 01:45:18.478
(GROANS) (CROWD BOOING)

01:45:18.562 --> 01:45:20.480
He can do this, he just has to stay calm.

01:45:20.564 --> 01:45:23.483
Nick Brannen, that was your second shot.

01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:26.444
But if you score on your third and final attempt,

01:45:26.529 --> 01:45:28.446
you can still win a trip for two

01:45:28.531 --> 01:45:30.991
to the NHL All-Star Game in Carolina.

01:45:31.075 --> 01:45:33.034
Are you ready? Yeah, I'm ready.

01:45:33.119 --> 01:45:34.202
Okay, good luck.

01:45:34.954 --> 01:45:36.121
Dude, seats are taken.

01:45:36.205 --> 01:45:37.247
It's between periods.

01:45:37.331 --> 01:45:38.373
I've got food here!

01:45:38.457 --> 01:45:39.791
What are you, a hall monitor?

01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:41.793
I'm not touching your food! I know the guy!

01:45:46.799 --> 01:45:47.924
Nick!

01:45:49.093 --> 01:45:53.763
Great moments are born from great opportunities.

01:45:55.558 --> 01:45:58.268
That's what you have here tonight, Nick.

01:45:58.436 --> 01:46:01.771
That's what you've earned here tonight!

01:46:03.065 --> 01:46:04.983
One shot.

01:46:05.067 --> 01:46:08.236
You take it 10 times, you might miss nine.

01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:11.197
But not this shot, Nick.

01:46:11.282 --> 01:46:13.616
Not tonight.

01:46:22.710 --> 01:46:24.044
(EXHALES NERVOUSLY)

01:46:24.128 --> 01:46:25.754
Come on, big guy. Come on, baby.

01:46:40.978 --> 01:46:42.729
(BUZZER SOUNDING)

01:46:42.813 --> 01:46:43.897
Yes!

01:46:44.648 --> 01:46:46.024
Whoo-hoo!

01:46:46.108 --> 01:46:48.568
Congratulations to Nick Brannen

01:46:48.652 --> 01:46:51.571
who's won a trip for two to the NHL All-Star Game

01:46:51.655 --> 01:46:53.323
in Carolina.

01:46:53.491 --> 01:46:56.785
Yes, you did! Yes, you did!

01:46:56.994 --> 01:46:58.328
Yeah!

01:46:58.662 --> 01:47:01.289
They can never take it away from you!

01:47:07.088 --> 01:47:08.421
(POP SONG PLAYING)

01:47:08.506 --> 01:47:09.589
Ronny!

01:47:30.736 --> 01:47:32.529
Yes, buddy! Yeah, Ronny!

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:36.699
I knew you'd do it! I told you I would do it!

01:47:44.291 --> 01:47:45.542
