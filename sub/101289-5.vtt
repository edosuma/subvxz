Is it, like, angst from missing Luke?

not seeing him every second after school

Mr. Koontz,
our beloved substitute teacher,

03:12.650 --> 03:14.444

Mr. Koontz was my greatest mentor.

03:31.252 --> 03:33.630
He legit explained Algebra II to me once.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.006
It was a game changer.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.592
He always waved at me in the hallway

03:37.675 --> 03:39.427
and I never waved back.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.930
But I realize now,

Koontz taught me how to love.

03:52.106 --> 03:53.733
this is the first dead person
we've ever known?

03:53.816 --> 03:55.360
Because we never knew
Mee-maw and Dee-daw.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.946
You're right.
We've only ever known dead pets.

are super insane.

But is he even in Heaven?

04:17.173 --> 04:19.092

He went to Heaven.

and then straight into a milk?

04:59.882 --> 05:01.843
I know in my heart of hearts, though,

05:02.302 --> 05:05.555
that a little time apart outside of school
can't touch us.

05:07.807 --> 05:08.891
Um, excuse me for living,

05:08.975 --> 05:11.686
but why'd you say that Mr. Koontz
wasn't necessarily in Heaven?

05:11.769 --> 05:12.854
Did you ever notice

05:12.937 --> 05:14.814
how Koontz didn't participate
in morning prayer?

05:15.231 --> 05:16.899
Yeah. I figured it was a medical issue.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.318
Mm-mm. He was agnostic.

05:18.401 --> 05:19.986
Is that where you think
that God is a woman?

05:20.069 --> 05:22.030
No. It's where you don't know
what to believe,

05:22.113 --> 05:24.949
which is bizarre,
because it's all right there in the Bible.

was the one who found him.

05:30.121 --> 05:32.623

all alone on the edge of the field,

-That's awful.

He has to go on
a month-long paid vacation to recover.

No, it's awful
about Mr. Koontz dying alone.

than to be alone in this life.

[April] Didn't you hear
the moment of silence?

06:12.288 --> 06:14.749
-It was, like, eight seconds.
-Mm-hm.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.709
That's all we're going to do for him?

06:16.793 --> 06:17.710
He was a nice man.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.670
I saw him brake for a squirrel once,

06:20.129 --> 06:21.923
-and then he got rear-ended.
-Oh.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.550
Don't you feel that as Christians,
we should honor him?

06:24.634 --> 06:25.885
Of course, dear,

06:25.968 --> 06:28.554
but he didn't have
that deep of a tie to the school.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.933
I mean, for instance,
if he had gone to Willingham as a student,

06:32.016 --> 06:33.351
and then he came back to teach,

06:33.434 --> 06:36.354
I mean, we'd definitely have a service
for someone like that.

06:36.437 --> 06:38.481
And if we did,
I'm sure there'd be  a mix CD

06:38.564 --> 06:40.358
in her upper left-hand desk drawer.

06:41.025 --> 06:44.153
Well, we would love
to take it upon ourselves

06:44.237 --> 06:47.115
and put together a memorial for him,
if that's okay.

06:47.198 --> 06:48.241
-Oh.
-And it should be,

06:48.324 --> 06:50.827
since it's a school activity,
during school hours.

06:51.536 --> 06:54.288
That is so lovely and thoughtful of you.

06:55.039 --> 06:58.876
I also had the idea
to put on a memorial for him.

06:59.168 --> 07:03.297
It slipped my mind
because of my devastation over his demise.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.215
Oh.

07:04.298 --> 07:07.510
I'm wracked with grief.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.137
-Oh.
-Hm.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.722
I thought your stance on substitutes
was that they shouldn't exist

07:11.806 --> 07:13.933
because they allow
the regular teachers to be lazy.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.768
-Mmm.
-It doesn't sound like me.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.311
Do you know how you sound?

07:18.062 --> 07:20.148
I will set my grief aside

07:20.231 --> 07:25.570
and since we all had the idea,
we can plan the memorial as a threesome.

07:26.070 --> 07:28.823
I mean, the three of us together.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.368
Well, that's really sweet,
um, but-- but we really feel like the Lord

07:32.452 --> 07:34.620
meant for us to take on
this challenge together,

07:34.704 --> 07:35.746
just the two of us.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.707
Well, as Fellowship leader,

07:37.790 --> 07:42.044
it's my duty to lead
during times of emotional distress.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.463

07:43.546 --> 07:45.506

07:45.923 --> 07:48.801

because I know y'all were close once.

07:51.637 --> 07:52.889
That was a long time ago.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.391
Should we talk logistics, pick a theme?

07:55.892 --> 07:57.435
Isn't the theme "death"?

07:58.144 --> 07:58.978
Or "memory".

07:59.562 --> 08:00.605
We can do better.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.815
[Ellen] See? What a great team!

08:02.899 --> 08:03.941
I mean, my goodness!

limit follow-up questions.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.850
Yes, and we want anecdotes.

hard to get through that door?

Yeah.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.368
I like to be able to stand in any one spot

08:55.451 --> 08:57.828
and behold the entirety of my domain

and all my personal possessions.

[Blair gasps]

09:00.915 --> 09:02.458
That is so sad.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.211
You lost all your belongings in a fire.

09:06.087 --> 09:06.963
No, I didn't.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.548
Then where are they?

You're looking at them. The...

09:11.217 --> 09:14.762
Concert posters, vinyl,
wardrobe, and one pant.

09:15.346 --> 09:18.849
A "pant"? Is that, like, half a pants?

09:19.433 --> 09:20.893
It's a pan that's also a pot.

09:21.477 --> 09:23.354
Hey, can we get back to the boxes?

09:23.437 --> 09:25.022
We've got a lot of boxes to move here.

[groans] Why'd you order yogurt toppings
to your apartment in the first place?

09:28.651 --> 09:31.028
Because I hit the wrong mailing address
on Amazong.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.073
Did he just say, "Amazong"?

09:34.156 --> 09:35.366
Yes, and I will never forget it.

09:35.449 --> 09:36.617
He needs more fixing than I thought.

09:36.701 --> 09:37.868
He's living in a flophouse.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.580
We have to encourage him
to extend himself, but subtly.

09:40.663 --> 09:43.082
-He hates when we're too direct.
-He hates it when we're most things,

09:43.165 --> 09:45.167
but we're basically his best friends,
it's our job to help.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.670
-Yes. Hey, Bowse?
-Mm.

09:47.753 --> 09:49.213
-You know what you should do?
-Mm-mm.

09:49.297 --> 09:51.132
Not put your mattress
directly on the floor.

Do you think a woman
wants to sleep on that?

09:52.758 --> 09:54.969
Hey, let's speed this up. New rule.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.722
Everybody's gonna grab two boxes
at a time. Come on!

09:57.805 --> 10:00.891
-Ow, my arms.
-I haven't eaten yet this afternoon.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.143
All right. [groans]

10:02.643 --> 10:03.894
Smaller boxes go in the back.

10:03.978 --> 10:04.895
Yeah, yeah.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.275
Oh, my God.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.027
That's Terrance Coin.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.868
-Hey.
-That's Terrance Coin.

10:18.951 --> 10:20.745
-Oh, Jesus.
-What's he doing here?

10:21.454 --> 10:24.707
If he was here, which I haven't noticed
because I don't care,

10:25.207 --> 10:27.293
he would be getting his assignment
from Yolanda.

10:27.376 --> 10:28.753
[both sigh]

10:29.378 --> 10:30.504

10:31.922 --> 10:33.466
[Terrance chuckles]

10:33.549 --> 10:35.301
Is that the Bowster?

10:35.384 --> 10:37.053
Yeah, well, it's-- you know. Hey--

10:37.136 --> 10:38.554
Bowsin' Bowser!

10:38.638 --> 10:39.639
[grunts]

10:39.722 --> 10:40.556
Yeah.

10:40.931 --> 10:41.849
Sup, my guy?

10:41.932 --> 10:43.476
That's enough. Yeah, thank you.

10:43.559 --> 10:47.355
Yolanda said this was your joint. Yikes.

10:47.438 --> 10:48.731
This is my, um...

10:49.190 --> 10:52.443
office/yogurt restaurant. Yeah.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.320
You look good, man.

10:54.403 --> 10:55.821
What's your workout regimen?

10:57.323 --> 11:00.076
Well, I put on some weight,
so, uh... eating.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.411
[both laugh]

11:02.495 --> 11:04.121
-You're in the building phase.
-Well...

11:04.205 --> 11:05.665
-I get it. I love it.
-That's enough.

11:05.998 --> 11:08.000
-Thank you. Mm-hm.
-Keep up the good work, bro.

11:08.084 --> 11:10.211
-[both] Bowser, please. Bowser, please.
-Stop that.

11:10.294 --> 11:11.796
-Please!
-Would you stop-- Hey, okay.

11:11.879 --> 11:14.882
[groans]
Terrance, this is Sterling and Blair.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.759
-Hi.
-Hi. Blair.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.470
-You're gorgeous.
-Really cool to meet you.

11:19.553 --> 11:20.763
-It's really cool.
-That's what I said!

11:20.846 --> 11:23.974
Nice to make your acquaintances.
You all work with Bowser?

11:24.058 --> 11:24.892
Mostly.

11:25.601 --> 11:26.727
Uh...

11:26.811 --> 11:27.645
Mainly.

11:28.979 --> 11:29.897
Strictly. We...

11:30.314 --> 11:32.108
Yeah, we bounty hunt with Bowser.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.026
Please don't ask us to work with you.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.446
Uh... No, it's great, you know,
meeting colleagues.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.032
Folks that truly understand the work.

11:40.116 --> 11:41.033
Yes.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.994
You know, I like to think of us
as fishermen,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.330
cutting through the freezing waters,

11:47.415 --> 11:50.042
pulling in our nets hand over hand.

11:50.626 --> 11:53.504
The catch of the day
flopping on the icy deck,

11:53.921 --> 11:56.882
all to feed the mouth of justice.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.968
That hangry beast.

12:01.053 --> 12:01.887
What?

12:01.971 --> 12:05.516
Well, I'm off to rope
that dog-fighting ring king.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.101
Till we meet again.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.602
-Yes, please.
-Bowser.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.438
-Hey, you.
-[Blair] Call us, let us know.

12:11.021 --> 12:11.856
[sighs]

12:12.398 --> 12:14.525
He should write a book about fishing.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.445
Get it.

12:19.029 --> 12:19.864
Come on.

12:21.532 --> 12:22.742
I'll tell you one thing.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.244
That Terrance sure is a dick. Hm?

12:25.327 --> 12:26.787
Asking me about my eating habits?

12:26.871 --> 12:29.623
Terrance is living his best life.
He's too busy to be a dick.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.584
-Love your perspective.
-Good.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.002
-Very helpful.
-I'm glad.

12:33.085 --> 12:34.044
Assignment, please.

12:34.128 --> 12:37.047
You'll be bringing in Cherry Grigio.

12:37.298 --> 12:40.259
No, you didn't. Shit.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.305
Ladies, Miss Grigio's an exotic dancer

12:44.388 --> 12:48.517
whose latest intrigue is owing the city
15 grand in parking tickets.

12:48.601 --> 12:50.811
Lady does not think
the rules apply to her.

12:50.895 --> 12:53.647
In fact, she refuses
to adhere to daylight savings time.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.733
It helps her ignore street cleaning days.

12:55.983 --> 12:56.901
Smart.

12:56.984 --> 12:58.319
The slippery stripper.

12:58.402 --> 13:00.696
She's the bane of Bowser's existence.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.740
What? I thought we were.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.033
Anecdote, please.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.326
[knocking]

13:05.409 --> 13:06.786
Let me just grab my stuff.

13:09.288 --> 13:10.706

13:10.790 --> 13:12.166
I just need to grab my stuff.

13:12.541 --> 13:13.959
Aren't you holding it?

13:14.043 --> 13:15.461
-[grunts]
-Ow!

13:15.544 --> 13:17.254
Just let me grab my stuff.

13:18.297 --> 13:19.256
Stuff...

13:27.807 --> 13:29.308
Un-fucking-believable.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.019
No Cherry Grigio.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.438
I'm down my favorite toenail
because of that woman.

13:35.022 --> 13:36.690
Oh, come on,
you always end up catching her.

13:36.774 --> 13:40.277
Yeah, but it takes 72 hours
and a year off my life each time.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.530
Now, why would you write her
another bond anyway?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.491
It's like her side-hustle
from stripping is skipping.

13:45.866 --> 13:47.952
She's basically my favorite TV show.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.328
Oh, jeez.

13:50.037 --> 13:52.623
Fine. If you don't want her,
I'll give her to Terrance.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.042
No, no. Wait, Bowser.
I'm sure the three of us

13:55.125 --> 13:56.502
could bring her in quick and easy.

13:57.086 --> 13:57.920
Come on.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.046
[Bowser groans]

13:59.713 --> 14:02.091
-All right, fine. We'll take her.
-[Sterling squeals]

14:02.174 --> 14:04.468
-[gasps] A real stripper.
-Yes!

14:04.927 --> 14:06.387
Ooh! Ooh!

14:06.470 --> 14:07.471
Please don't do that.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.889
-Oh.
-Yes, ma'am.

14:09.974 --> 14:12.560
-[school bell rings]
-[yawns]

14:12.643 --> 14:14.603
Up late date plan texting?

14:14.687 --> 14:17.106
Your phone light is exceedingly bright,
by the way.

14:17.189 --> 14:19.275
I was looking at songs
for our sex playlist,

14:19.358 --> 14:21.569
which took me to the Cure,
which took me to the Smiths,

14:21.652 --> 14:23.988
which took me to this video wormhole

14:24.071 --> 14:26.991
of people who have actually seen
the light that never goes out.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.243
And then I had this dream

14:29.326 --> 14:31.203
that Mr. Koontz was trying
to tell me something,

14:31.287 --> 14:33.289
but I couldn't hear him.

14:33.914 --> 14:34.790
That's weird.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.334
Yeah, I'm actually
having a really hard time shaking it.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.169
-And I think it's because he--
-That reminds me, babe.

14:39.253 --> 14:40.796
Uh, you were in my dream last night.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.384
Of course,
the man is co-opting the conversation.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.386
No offense, Luke. Love you.

14:47.887 --> 14:48.721
Love you.

14:49.179 --> 14:50.014
Thanks.

14:52.016 --> 14:52.892
Don't move!

14:52.975 --> 14:54.310
Don't move, either of you.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.937
That's the essay that I wrote
on laissez-faire economics.

14:57.021 --> 14:58.314
You know the one where I railed on it?

14:58.397 --> 14:59.481
You hate laissez-faire.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.317
Mr. Koontz graded that.

15:01.650 --> 15:03.777
And now it just flew out of my backpack?

15:04.695 --> 15:07.197
I mean, it's one thing to be in my dreams,
but now this?

15:08.198 --> 15:10.659
Wait, it says, "Think outside the box."

15:11.660 --> 15:14.455
Oh, shit. This is straight up haunting.

15:14.538 --> 15:15.789
The original trolling!

15:15.873 --> 15:19.043
Or you're just stressed, okay?
I don't think you're really being haunted.

15:19.126 --> 15:20.210
How do you know that?

15:21.295 --> 15:23.047
I'm starting to get that feeling
where my tongue goes numb.

15:23.130 --> 15:24.715
Did you just eat mango?

15:25.299 --> 15:26.425
[gasps]

15:27.009 --> 15:28.928
Okay, that is dramatic, even for her.

15:30.429 --> 15:33.223
I hate to bring this up, but you didn't do
your activities log yesterday.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.642
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:34.725 --> 15:35.851
I had to make these flyers,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.686
since April thinks paper
is way too analog,

15:37.770 --> 15:40.189
and I had to teach myself
Adobe Illustrator first,

15:40.272 --> 15:41.565
which turned out to be really fun.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.192
Once I got a hold
of the whole vectors thing,

15:43.275 --> 15:44.401
I was rockin' and rolling.

15:44.485 --> 15:46.403
You see how "memorial"
kind of jumps out at you

15:46.487 --> 15:48.280
and there's a shadow behind the dove?

15:48.364 --> 15:49.365
Not easy.

15:51.241 --> 15:53.077
Still could have written it
in the log, though.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.372
So, what did you do?

15:59.708 --> 16:00.542
I thought about you.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.587
-Aw.
-You are my beautiful rose petal.

16:05.589 --> 16:06.507
Oh, memorial tomorrow.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.639
-[cell phone ringing]
-Beautiful?

16:13.722 --> 16:15.766
[gasps] Ooh, I can't believe I got you.

16:15.849 --> 16:17.851
You got me? I can't believe I got you.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.895
Oh, you're being sweet.
It's going to slow me down.

16:19.979 --> 16:20.980
Okay, go with me here.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.816
I have felt super weird
since our sub died.

16:23.899 --> 16:26.485
Like, when you hear that silent sound

16:26.568 --> 16:28.445
that tells you that the TV is still on

16:28.529 --> 16:31.115
and then out of nowhere,
this paper that he graded

16:31.198 --> 16:33.826
flew into my face with a message on it.

16:34.201 --> 16:36.537
I feel like he needs something from me,

16:36.870 --> 16:38.163
and I'm super freaked out.

16:38.247 --> 16:40.207
And Sterling's just not helping me at all.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.458
Oh, wow, I feel you.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.044
You know, I thought I saw
the ghost of my grandma once,

16:44.128 --> 16:46.088
but she's alive, so it fucked with me.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.923
I'm so happy you get it.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.508
Maybe your guy's in purgatory.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.385
You know, stuck in limbo,

16:51.719 --> 16:53.470
asking for prayers so he can move on?

16:53.971 --> 16:54.888
Prayers.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.766
Miles, you don't understand.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.601
Praying is in my blood.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.563
-Ah, you're the freaking best.
-Yeah, I know. I got your back!

17:02.646 --> 17:03.689

17:03.772 --> 17:05.315
Look, um, if you got your plate full,

17:05.399 --> 17:07.609
we can reschedule our night tomorrow.

17:07.693 --> 17:08.569
Oh, no way.

17:08.652 --> 17:10.821
I'm not going to let
a little death and haunting

17:10.904 --> 17:12.656
get in the way of our date. [chuckles]

Calla lilies are classic and in season,

19:20.033 --> 19:21.618
but we'd love to avoid white.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.703
It's so expected.

19:22.786 --> 19:25.247
Great. Go dark purple
and order a few dozen,

19:25.330 --> 19:26.832
enough to cramp the stage.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.417
No white means no doves.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.460
Everybody's seen those things
fly out of funerals.

19:30.544 --> 19:33.172
So, we were thinking... butterflies.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.132
[gasps] Or maybe just flies.

19:35.382 --> 19:36.925
That would really make a statement.
Write that down.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.677
-No, do not.
-You guys, this is too much.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.679
It's a memorial.
It's meant to be respectful.

19:40.762 --> 19:43.223
It will be. You have my word.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.351
We want a simple memorial
to honor a simple man.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.353
You know what?

19:48.437 --> 19:50.814
You are never gonna let me lead
the way that I should.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.441
So, I quit.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.235
I hope your eulogy
is better than your decor.

19:55.777 --> 19:58.405
I should focus on my mourning anyway.

20:07.956 --> 20:09.082
A eulogy?

20:09.166 --> 20:10.500
I didn't even think about that.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.878
What am I supposed to write
about someone I barely even know

20:12.961 --> 20:15.172
who seemed so... alone?

20:15.255 --> 20:17.007
Maybe we can look him up
on the "Get To Know Your Teacher" page.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.175
on the school website?

20:18.759 --> 20:20.677
Dang, that is sad.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.013
He listed his favorite activity as movies

20:23.096 --> 20:26.016
and left the family question blank.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.604
Kind of reminds me of that guy we saw
mini-golfing alone. [chuckles]

20:31.146 --> 20:32.439
So grim.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.234
He was just minding his own business.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.194
He gave himself a par five
on the grizzly bear mouth

20:37.277 --> 20:39.905
and I saw him take at least
seven strokes. That's cheating.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.865
How am I supposed to write a whole eulogy

20:41.949 --> 20:44.576
about someone
whose favorite beverage is ice water

20:44.660 --> 20:46.411
and favorite place, "The plains"?

20:46.495 --> 20:48.664
If anyone can write a eulogy with this,
you can.

20:48.997 --> 20:49.831
You're right.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.585
[solemn organ music]

20:55.254 --> 20:57.339
Our Father, who art in Heaven.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.091
Hallowed be thy name.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.467
Thy kingdom come.

21:07.516 --> 21:11.228
Dear Lord, our substitute teacher died,

21:12.062 --> 21:13.480
but you know that.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.274
because you took him.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.441
No judgments.

21:18.485 --> 21:19.987
He was agnostic.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.781
I guess you already know that as well.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.200
God! Okay, keep up, Blair! [sniffs]

21:25.993 --> 21:28.495
What I'm trying to say is...

21:29.204 --> 21:31.957
we all have our doubts sometimes,

21:33.292 --> 21:37.838
and maybe he didn't know
what he was doing on Earth,

21:38.380 --> 21:41.425
so he had no idea what to expect
on the other side.

21:44.052 --> 21:44.928
So...

21:46.305 --> 21:47.180
let him in.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.141
Okay?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.143
If it's cool.

21:51.226 --> 21:53.270
I'm not trying to boss you. [chuckles]

21:56.231 --> 21:57.065
Amen.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.193
And now, a reading.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.156
Death...

22:04.906 --> 22:07.284
Death. Death. Death, got it.

22:07.534 --> 22:10.495
"The locusts looked like horses
prepared for battle.

22:10.579 --> 22:13.457
They had tails like scorpions,

22:13.540 --> 22:16.168
and in their tails, they had

22:16.501 --> 22:18.670
power to torment people for five months"?

22:19.588 --> 22:20.630
What the--

22:21.506 --> 22:22.758
[screaming]

22:23.258 --> 22:25.093
[gasping]

22:28.472 --> 22:29.765
I'm sorry.

22:29.848 --> 22:32.184
[Sterling] You set the Bible on fire?

22:32.809 --> 22:34.394
It was a small fire,

22:34.478 --> 22:37.606
but it was just really large
in proportion to the size of the book.

22:37.689 --> 22:38.899
Well, what did you do with it?

22:38.982 --> 22:40.150
I put it back on the shelf.

22:40.233 --> 22:41.401
I'm going to pretend that
this didn't happen

22:41.485 --> 22:43.653
until maybe forever or the end of time.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.323
Okay. Well, maybe the fire was God's way
of telling you that you did it.

22:46.406 --> 22:47.574
You helped Mr. Koontz.

22:47.657 --> 22:50.410
Right. Like, who's to say
that fire is a bad thing?

22:50.494 --> 22:53.205
[scoffs] Duh. Hello? The burning bush.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.122
Mm.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.083
-Chariots of Fire.
-Mm.

22:56.166 --> 22:59.920
Oh, and controlled fires
that prevent larger wildfires

23:00.003 --> 23:02.506
that would be way bigger
and harder to control.

23:02.589 --> 23:03.673
Okay, I think we lost the thread.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.258
Hey, Bowser, wait for us.

23:05.342 --> 23:07.552
[hip hop music playing]

23:08.970 --> 23:09.888
All right, remember.

23:09.971 --> 23:12.265
Cherry Grigio changes her look
all the time.

23:12.349 --> 23:14.476
Sometimes she's blonde,
sometimes she's a red-head.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.436
or that kind of red
that looks like purple.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.564
Keep your heads on a swivel.
Don't fall for any of her tricks.

23:19.648 --> 23:20.565
She's slippery.

23:20.649 --> 23:23.110
You've said, "slippery",
like, ten times now.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.569
It's starting to get gross.

23:25.487 --> 23:26.321
I'm just saying.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.700
We passed for 21!

23:30.784 --> 23:33.161
Oh, my God. Slow down, life!

23:34.162 --> 23:36.164
[music blasting]

23:54.558 --> 23:57.310
This is the sexiest place I've ever been.

23:57.769 --> 23:59.729
Oh, my God.
Look at that girl's butt crack.

23:59.813 --> 24:00.939
It's so vertical.

24:01.022 --> 24:03.275
It goes really far up her back!

24:06.236 --> 24:08.196
Oh, beautiful!

24:08.280 --> 24:09.781
You're sensual, madam.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.491
[Sterling] God.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.871
Look at these women.
They are so comfortable in their bodies.

24:15.954 --> 24:16.997
It's so cool.

24:17.372 --> 24:18.832
Okay, pace yourselves.

24:19.249 --> 24:21.334
This could take a while
and I need you all calculating

24:21.418 --> 24:23.128
-any possible escape routes.
-Okay.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.756
Ah, there she is.

24:29.009 --> 24:30.635
-Let's triangulate.
-Okay.

24:31.761 --> 24:35.724
So I told him, "Come back
when you've got proof I've got a liver...

24:35.807 --> 24:37.142
[scoffs] ...and I'll stop."

24:37.225 --> 24:38.560
[both chuckle]

24:38.643 --> 24:39.811
Hi, Cherry.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.773
Oh, Bowser, hello.

24:44.900 --> 24:45.984
How's the toe?

24:46.067 --> 24:48.153
[chuckles] You know how it is.

24:49.112 --> 24:50.864
All right, you got me.

24:51.406 --> 24:52.741
Just need to grab my stuff.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.201
Uh-uh-uh.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.619
No way, lady.

24:55.702 --> 24:58.788
Yeah, you can't fool a pheasant
when she's got a fox for a friend.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.500
We know your move
and you're not moving from that spot.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.709
[Blair] Mm-mm.

25:02.792 --> 25:04.669
[sighs] Moonstone?

25:06.379 --> 25:07.881
Can you grab my stuff for me?

25:09.382 --> 25:10.258
You're cranky.

25:10.675 --> 25:14.095
I want that one to take me in.

25:15.805 --> 25:16.640
Hi, ladies!

25:16.723 --> 25:17.933
Hey, are you stalking me?

25:18.016 --> 25:18.975
Boweezy,

25:19.059 --> 25:23.188
I'm here for my weekly fix of sirloin
and this wonderful troupe of performers.

25:23.271 --> 25:25.565
I'll always defend
one night a week as my me time.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.442
-[Bowser] Do you?
-Yeah, it's hard though.

25:27.776 --> 25:30.987
Take me in, sir. I've been bad.

25:31.905 --> 25:32.906
See?

25:33.323 --> 25:35.825
Sorry, Miss Grigio. I'm not working.

25:36.409 --> 25:37.452
I'm rejuvenating.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.788
But you're in great hands.

25:41.289 --> 25:42.749
All right. You're stuck with me.

25:43.416 --> 25:45.210
And it's going exactly according to plan.

25:45.293 --> 25:46.962
I gave you too much credit--

25:47.671 --> 25:49.548
Give him here.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.132
What the hell is that?

25:51.216 --> 25:53.218
It's a baby.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.135
Thanks, Moon.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.428
[in cute voice] Oh, hello.

25:55.512 --> 25:57.430
Hey, Lawrence.
How was your nap, baby?

25:58.265 --> 25:59.099
Ooh.

25:59.641 --> 26:00.475
That's tough.

26:01.142 --> 26:02.644
Can't bring a baby in with you to jail.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.688
I know, Terrance. Thank you.

26:05.438 --> 26:07.107
-You're welcome.
-[Sterling] Thank you.

26:07.524 --> 26:10.318
I can't believe you had a baby recently.
You do not look it.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.362
I'm sorry, ma'am.
We would not presume to know

26:12.445 --> 26:14.030
what a body should or shouldn't look like.

26:14.114 --> 26:17.117
I need to know if you got somebody
you can call to take this child.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.744
Is there someone you can call
to come take this child?

26:21.121 --> 26:21.955
Mm.

26:22.706 --> 26:23.540
My sister,

26:24.416 --> 26:27.335
but, mm-mm, she's covering for Ramon
at the fireworks stand

26:27.419 --> 26:28.837
because he's got a knuckle injury,

26:28.920 --> 26:30.964
so it might take her a minute to get here.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.133
Can I get my phone out of my bag?

26:33.216 --> 26:34.593
-Uh-uh!
-Uh-uh! Don't you--

26:34.676 --> 26:35.677
Girl!

26:49.232 --> 26:50.817
He was on Instagram!

26:52.152 --> 26:55.363
I knew it, every one of his posts
is a picture of him by himself.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.326
Huh. He went skydiving?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.953
Who would want to do that?
You are basically tempting death.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.246
Yeah, plus if you go alone,

27:03.330 --> 27:06.082
who's gonna laugh at your rubbery face
flapping in the wind?

27:06.916 --> 27:07.834
[Blair] Hm.

27:08.543 --> 27:10.629
Some of this stuff was pretty cool shit,
I guess.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.547
At least he looks happy.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.966
All this existential crisising
is really making me thirsty.

27:15.050 --> 27:16.051
Do you want anything?

27:16.426 --> 27:17.260
Okay.

27:20.597 --> 27:21.556
[sniffs]

27:21.640 --> 27:23.183
[sobbing and laughing]

27:24.726 --> 27:27.270
I've been dreaming
about this summit for years.

27:30.231 --> 27:31.566
I finally did it.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.860
[sniffs]

27:33.943 --> 27:36.363
There's no one around for miles.

27:36.738 --> 27:40.533
Oh, my God. It's so beautiful.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.911
Hey. Shirley Temple, please.

27:43.620 --> 27:44.913
[cell phone dings]

27:46.456 --> 27:47.540
[chuckles]

28:09.479 --> 28:11.481
Hey! What are you doin' over here?

28:11.564 --> 28:14.818
I need the two of you at the side exit.
I keep seeing her eyes flit over to it.

28:15.360 --> 28:17.654
I thought I saw my dead teacher
by the pool tables.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.449
Shit, is this like when you teenagers
were marrying your vampires?

28:21.533 --> 28:22.617
He's still here.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.787
When I burned that Bible
earlier today on total accident,

28:26.329 --> 28:28.581
I must have failed
to usher him into Heaven.

28:28.665 --> 28:30.709
Now, he'll be stuck
in no-man's land forever.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.878
What if I opened up a portal
that I'll never be able to close?

28:33.962 --> 28:36.214
You might be thinking about death
too much.

28:36.297 --> 28:38.550
What? How could you not think about it?

28:39.134 --> 28:40.468
Aren't you like 70?

28:40.552 --> 28:41.594
I'm 50!

28:41.678 --> 28:43.096
-You're a bounty hunter.
-Yeah.

28:43.179 --> 28:45.056
You could die at any moment.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.517
And when you do, I'll turn around and bam!

28:47.600 --> 28:49.060
I'll have two ghosts haunting me.

28:49.144 --> 28:52.230
And you two will frolic all day
while I become the sexy older woman

28:52.313 --> 28:54.524
tormented by the pranks
you play on me while I sleep.

28:54.607 --> 28:55.900
Okay, okay...

28:56.359 --> 28:57.235
Take a breath.

28:57.986 --> 28:59.112
Deep breath, come on!

28:59.195 --> 29:00.530
[both breathe deeply]

29:00.613 --> 29:02.615
Let it out. Let it out.

29:02.699 --> 29:03.825
[exhales deeply]

29:04.659 --> 29:06.286
What if there's no heaven or hell?

29:07.078 --> 29:09.581
And you don't need
to help anybody get anywhere?

29:11.124 --> 29:12.292
Are you hypnotizing me?

29:13.793 --> 29:15.879
No, I'm serious.

29:16.671 --> 29:19.048
Heaven and hell are constructs

29:19.424 --> 29:21.050
that personally don't work for me.

29:21.134 --> 29:22.510
When I'm dead, I'm dead.

29:22.594 --> 29:24.471
Ain't none of my business
where I go after that.

29:25.305 --> 29:26.639
But that's so scary.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.893
Don't you want to know
what happens after you cross over?

29:30.477 --> 29:31.853
Like, whether it's good or bad?

29:31.936 --> 29:34.439
There is zero way to know, okay?

29:34.522 --> 29:36.274
Until you cross that threshold.

29:37.066 --> 29:40.278
It could be a black void.
It could be rainbows.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.946
It could be a ghost world

29:42.030 --> 29:44.365
where a person
uncharacteristically frolics all day.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.951
There's no certainty in life or death,

29:48.036 --> 29:50.163
so why kill yourself
worrying about anything?

29:52.540 --> 29:53.374
Come on.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.711
Oh, Goddamn it, where's Cherry?

but it would go down a lot faster

43:00.244 --> 43:01.787
if we weren't handcuffed to each other.

43:02.663 --> 43:04.665
Sorry, I'm not taking any chances.

43:05.749 --> 43:08.335
Well, can you at least
lift my drink up to my lips?

[slurps]

43:18.596 --> 43:19.597
Ahh.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.183
I've always had a crush on you.

43:23.517 --> 43:25.227
And that's why you run from me?

43:25.311 --> 43:26.353
[sighs]

43:26.437 --> 43:29.732
Maybe I always knew
our connection would be too intense.

43:31.358 --> 43:32.901
I see a kindred spirit in you.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.988
We both play by our own rules,

43:36.071 --> 43:37.740
and neither of us wants to change.

43:40.701 --> 43:44.288
Most people lately
have had a real problem with how I am.

43:45.289 --> 43:47.916
Can't see why, though.
I'm doing just fine.

43:48.375 --> 43:50.669
Hell, yeah. We're great.

43:51.503 --> 43:55.090

-Sorry, baby. Gotta run.

44:05.351 --> 44:09.605
Uncuff me
or I'll mess up that pretty face.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.523
Oh, damn!

44:11.607 --> 44:12.775
Mm-hm.

44:12.858 --> 44:14.735
That's some pretty intense shit
right there.

44:16.654 --> 44:17.821
But I gotta tell you...

44:18.906 --> 44:21.200
I'm gonna have a ball watching you try.

44:23.911 --> 44:24.953
Dang, man!

44:25.204 --> 44:27.956
You didn't think I was gonna let you
get ahead of me again, did you?

44:28.749 --> 44:29.917
And do us both a favor,

44:30.000 --> 44:32.503
and stop pretending
this version of you works, huh?

When an entire region
agrees what the time is and you don't,
