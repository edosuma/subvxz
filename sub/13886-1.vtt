00:36.680 --> 00:38.875
Oh, Marnie.
Oh, my darling, don't.

00:39.840 --> 00:44.709
This isn't a time for sadness,
it's a time for joy, laughter. Don't you see?

00:44.880 --> 00:49.317
Whatever this crazy old world throws
at us now it doesn't matter.

00:49.480 --> 00:52.438
But we can never be together again.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.956
Oh, darling, you're wrong.
We'll always be together.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.429
It's just... we'll be apart.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.911
Wasn't that just beautiful?
Oh, well recommended, sir.

01:06.120 --> 01:08.395
Do you think they get back together?

01:08.600 --> 01:11.068
- I don't know.
- Pardon?

01:11.240 --> 01:13.071
I don't know!

01:13.960 --> 01:19.512
Wasn't it wonderful, the way he sacrificed
everything for the woman he loved?

01:19.720 --> 01:25.556
I thought it was the worst pile of blubbery
mush I've ever been compelled to endure.

01:25.720 --> 01:31.238
It's an insult to my backside that it was
forced to sit here growing carbuncles

01:31.400 --> 01:33.834
through such putrid adolescent slush.

01:34.040 --> 01:38.636
- You didn't find it uplifting?
- Not at all. It was totally unbelievable.

01:38.800 --> 01:41.792
Why give everything up
if he'll never see her again?

01:42.000 --> 01:46.391
Because she loved him,
and he could have that forever. Right, sir?

01:48.920 --> 01:54.233
Personally, I thought it started well.
That stuff with the ducks was great.

01:54.400 --> 01:57.233
When it went black and white, I fell asleep.

01:58.120 --> 02:01.192
Sir, that was the cartoon
before the main programme.

02:03.880 --> 02:08.317
Hang on, chaps.
We've got a blip. Quadrant 4, sector 492.

02:08.520 --> 02:12.354
- I'm onto it, Holly.
- Those kind of films really irritate me.

02:12.520 --> 02:17.878
Just not realistic. There isn't a man in the
universe who wouldn't have taken the job.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.635
- Total baloney.
- You said that about "King of Kings".

02:23.360 --> 02:27.353
Well, it's true. A carpenter's son
who learns tricks like that

02:27.520 --> 02:30.034
and doesn't go into show business?

02:30.200 --> 02:33.112
Do any of us believe that for a second?

02:33.320 --> 02:37.438
- He was the Son of God.
- And when he was carrying that cross,

02:37.600 --> 02:41.354
any normal bloke would mule-kick
the guys on the left and right

02:41.520 --> 02:46.196
and be over that green hill and far away
before you could say Pontius Pilate.

02:46.400 --> 02:49.312
Why do I feel that you've missed the point?

02:49.480 --> 02:54.474
Whether you believe it or not, it's about
a dude who sacrifices his life for love.

02:54.680 --> 02:56.671
Not realistic. As if!

02:57.880 --> 03:00.348
You've got no soul, man. No soul.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.956
- Sirs, you should take a look at this.
- Another vessel?

03:04.120 --> 03:06.680
Too small. It may be a missile.

03:06.840 --> 03:10.469
- Impact in 37 seconds.
- Plotting random evasion course.

03:10.680 --> 03:14.673
What?! Am I the only sane one?
Drop the defensive shields!

03:14.840 --> 03:18.799
A superlative suggestion, sir,
with just two minor flaws.

03:18.960 --> 03:24.956
One, we don't have any defensive shields,
and two, we don't have any defensive shields.

03:25.120 --> 03:27.680
Now, technically speaking,
that's only one flaw,

03:27.840 --> 03:32.152
but it was such a big one,
it was worth mentioning twice.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.117
Good point. Well made.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.991
Rimmer, what are you doing?

03:47.160 --> 03:50.152
It's incredible! It's beautiful!

03:50.360 --> 03:53.796
It's not registering on any scale.
Mass, velocity, molecular structure -

03:53.960 --> 03:55.951
all the readings are zero.

04:07.840 --> 04:11.276
Sir, I'm picking up
some kind of energy emission.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.794
They've taken Mr Rimmer!

04:15.000 --> 04:18.993
Quick! Let's get out of here
before they bring him back!

04:25.080 --> 04:28.516
I hope we didn't startle you. Nirvanah Crane.

04:28.720 --> 04:31.996
You touched me. I can touch.

04:33.600 --> 04:37.195
- How is this possible?
- This entire ship, its crew

04:37.360 --> 04:39.476
and everything on it is computer-generated.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.717
- You're all holograms? Even the ship?
- Salut.

04:42.920 --> 04:44.319
Salut.

04:47.160 --> 04:51.438
- How big's the crew?
- Just under 2,000. All top-flight personnel.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.354
- Hmm. What a ship.
- Floor 3125.

04:55.520 --> 04:57.909
Sports and sexual recreation.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.231
- Sports and what?
- Sex.

05:01.440 --> 05:05.035
- Don't you have a sex deck on your ship?
- No.

05:06.800 --> 05:12.557
- What do you do when you want to have sex?
- Well, we go for runs.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.234
Watch gardening programmes on the ship's vid.

05:15.440 --> 05:19.194
That's very bad for you.
Don't you feel tense or frustrated?

05:19.400 --> 05:23.234
Well, it's got worse
these last ten years, I can't deny it.

05:23.440 --> 05:25.431
Extraordinary. It's quite different here.

05:25.600 --> 05:30.799
It's a regulation to have sex
at least twice a day. It's a health rule.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.834
That's more than some people manage
in a lifetime!

05:35.040 --> 05:40.273
I mean sad, lonely people.
But what happens if you don't have a partner?

05:40.480 --> 05:42.516
If you don't have a partner?

05:42.720 --> 05:45.757
Well, some people - sad, lonely people -

05:45.920 --> 05:49.754
find that that people
just aren't attracted to them that way.

05:49.960 --> 05:55.159
I don't understand. It's bad manners
to refuse an offer of sexual coupling.

05:56.600 --> 05:58.431
Well...

05:58.600 --> 06:01.797
People have always complimented me
on my good manners.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.399
What a ship!

06:03.560 --> 06:07.109
We discarded the concept of "family"
in the 25th century,

06:07.280 --> 06:11.558
when scientists proved that all hang-ups
and neuroses are caused by parents.

06:11.760 --> 06:15.116
- I knew it.
- Families are disastrous for mental health.

06:15.280 --> 06:19.319
So are relationships.
These are outmoded concepts for us.

06:19.520 --> 06:22.478
But surely people still fall in love?

06:22.680 --> 06:24.910
We have developed beyond love.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.355
That is a short-term hormonal distraction

06:27.520 --> 06:30.671
which interferes with the pure pursuit
of personal advancement.

06:30.840 --> 06:34.719
We are holograms.
There is no risk of disease or pregnancy.

06:34.880 --> 06:38.668
That is why in our society,
we only believe in sex...

06:38.840 --> 06:42.150
constant, guilt-free sex.

06:43.880 --> 06:47.350
Poor Mr Rimmer. I fear he is in great danger.

06:47.560 --> 06:51.348
I'm trying to get them to handshake,
but they're not responding.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.189
Let's break out the laser cannons
and give 'em both barrels.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.716
An adroit suggestion, sir,
with just two minor drawbacks...

06:58.880 --> 07:00.677
OK! Forget it!

07:01.040 --> 07:04.077
There's nothing to shoot at.
Look - zero mass.

07:04.280 --> 07:07.750
- Of course! A holoship.
- A holoship?

07:07.960 --> 07:11.270
The project was in its initial phase
when I left the solar system.

07:11.520 --> 07:15.752
Ships of no mass or volume,
able to travel as super-light particles -

07:15.920 --> 07:18.718
tachyons - through wormholes and stargates,

07:18.880 --> 07:22.077
crewed by holograms
of great genius and bravery.

07:22.280 --> 07:25.989
And they've taken Rimmer?
He should fit in just perfectly.

07:26.200 --> 07:28.953
Now I understand why they didn't handshake.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.156
Holocrews are legendarily arrogant.

07:31.320 --> 07:35.393
They despise stupidity wherever they see it,
and they see it everywhere.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.670
Hang on, I'm getting another energy emission.

07:39.160 --> 07:43.870
Binks to Enlightenment. Have arrived
on the derelict. Confirm initial speculation.

07:44.040 --> 07:47.555
There is absolutely nothing
of any value or interest here.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.473
It's an old Class 2 ship-to-surface vessel,

07:50.640 --> 07:55.031
the very model, in fact,
that was withdrawn due to major design flaws.

07:55.920 --> 08:01.836
Crew, three. One Series 4000 mechanoid -
almost burnt out.

08:02.000 --> 08:05.675
Give it maybe three years.
Nothing of salvageable value.

08:05.840 --> 08:11.870
Ah, Felis sapiens, bred from the domestic
house cat and about half as smart.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.510
No value in future study of this species.

08:15.680 --> 08:20.117
What have we here? A human being,
or a very close approximation.

08:22.200 --> 08:26.910
Chronological age, mid-20s.
Physical age, 47.

08:27.880 --> 08:32.874
Grossly overweight, unnecessarily ugly,
otherwise would recommend it for the museum.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.793
Apart from that of no value or interest.

08:35.960 --> 08:41.796
Lister to Red Dwarf.
We have in our midst a complete smeg-pot.

08:42.919 --> 08:48.233
Brains in the anal region.
Chin absent, presumed missing.

08:49.200 --> 08:54.797
Genitalia small and inoffensive,
of no value or interest.

08:55.000 --> 08:59.039
Binks to Enlightenment.
Evidence of primitive humour.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.034
The human has knowledge of irony,
satire and imitation.

09:03.240 --> 09:06.949
With patient tuition
could maybe master simple tasks.

09:07.160 --> 09:12.109
Lister to Red Dwarf.
Displays evidence of spoiling for a rumble.

09:13.400 --> 09:16.233
Seems unable to grasp simple threats.

09:16.440 --> 09:21.798
With careful pummelling, could possibly be
sucking tomorrow's lunch through a straw.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.753
Binks to Enlightenment.
The human is under the delusion

09:24.920 --> 09:29.038
that he is somehow able
to bestow physical violence to a hologram.

09:29.240 --> 09:34.189
Lister to Red Dwarf.
The intruder seems to be blissfully unaware

09:34.360 --> 09:39.229
that we have a rather sturdy holowhip
in the munitions cabinet,

09:39.440 --> 09:43.672
and unless he wants his derriere
minced like burger meat,

09:43.880 --> 09:46.110
he'd better be history in two seconds.

09:46.320 --> 09:50.074
Binks to Enlightenment.
Recon mission complete, transmit.

09:50.280 --> 09:52.953
With speed, Enlightenment. Quickly, please!

09:53.160 --> 09:57.039
Captain, Mr Rimmer
from the mining ship Red Dwarf.

09:57.240 --> 10:01.028
Mr Rimmer. Oh, my word.
An old Class 1 hologram.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.955
I didn't realise you guys were still around.
Captain Hercule Platini,

10:06.120 --> 10:08.475
IQ 212. Number One.

10:09.240 --> 10:11.879
Commander Natalina Pushkin, IQ 201.

10:12.600 --> 10:16.195
Commander Randy Navarro, IQ 194.

10:17.960 --> 10:21.111
Second Technician Arnold Rimmer, IQ unknown.

10:23.280 --> 10:27.671
- Captain, this is a magnificent ship.
- So it should be, Mr Rimmer.

10:27.840 --> 10:32.630
After all, it was designed to carry the
hologrammatic cream of the Space Corps.

10:32.800 --> 10:36.156
Every crew member is top in his or her field.

10:36.320 --> 10:40.074
This is a ship, Mr Rimmer, of superhumans.

10:41.480 --> 10:44.916
Which is why
I feel I could really belong here.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.311
Are you serious?

10:48.800 --> 10:53.874
Everything I want in my life
is on this ship. I want to join you.

10:54.080 --> 10:56.514
Mr Rimmer, you are not an officer.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.793
Captain, I've been in effective command
of Red Dwarf for four years.

11:00.960 --> 11:06.080
I've guided that ragtail crew of whacked-out
crazies and peaceniks through hell and back.

11:07.600 --> 11:14.233
If I gave the order, those guys would crawl
over broken glass with their flies unzipped.

11:14.400 --> 11:16.391
So don't tell me I'm not an officer,

11:16.560 --> 11:20.678
just because in deep space,
there's no academy to award me my pips.

11:20.840 --> 11:24.230
- You've got to take me.
- Unfortunately, it's not that simple.

11:24.400 --> 11:26.960
The Enlightenment
has a full ship's complement.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.237
The only way in is "Dead Man's Boots".

11:30.440 --> 11:33.034
You'll have to challenge a crew member.

11:33.200 --> 11:37.193
There are tests
which tax the entire vista of your intellect.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.672
Oh.

11:40.080 --> 11:43.390
Tests that probe every aspect
of your mental capability.

11:43.600 --> 11:45.033
Ah.

11:45.240 --> 11:48.710
Should you win, your opponent's run time
would be terminated

11:48.880 --> 11:52.111
and their life-force would be used
to generate you.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.270
Who will be my opponent?

11:55.440 --> 11:58.955
Well, our computer will find
the most stimulating match-up.

11:59.120 --> 12:01.475
It has stochastic capabilities.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.877
It predicts the future
with only a 5% error margin,

12:05.040 --> 12:09.113
simply by extrapolating the most likely
outcome of all known variables.

12:09.280 --> 12:12.716
I am asking it
for your best chance of success.

12:12.880 --> 12:17.635
And here it is.
Your best shot is crew member 4172.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.918
You have a 96% probability of failure.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.752
Mr Rimmer, you have 24 hours to prepare.

12:27.920 --> 12:31.037
Well, thank you, Commander,
for a most fascinating afternoon.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.760
It's been most... fascinating.

12:33.920 --> 12:40.268
If you're not in a rush, we could retire
to my quarters and have sex for a few hours.

12:40.920 --> 12:44.708
That was just unbelievable.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.155
It's never been like that before.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.790
Was it OK?

12:50.960 --> 12:53.076
It was... different.

12:54.760 --> 12:59.231
- Different?
- You make love like a Japanese meal -

12:59.440 --> 13:02.716
small portions, but so many courses.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.476
- Look, Nirvanah...
- We must dress and go now.

13:12.080 --> 13:16.437
- Look, Nirvanah, what I'm trying to say...
- Please, don't say anything.

13:16.600 --> 13:22.072
I hope you didn't get me wrong. That meant
nothing to me. Less than nothing, really.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.117
Good.

13:24.280 --> 13:27.192
- Like playing tennis.
- As it should be.

13:28.280 --> 13:32.432
I, er... don't suppose
you fancy a tie-break?

13:32.600 --> 13:35.876
I'm sorry. I've got things I should do.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.871
Niet problemski.

13:38.480 --> 13:42.075
You know... we usually talk.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.909
- What do you talk about?
- Oh, research,

13:46.080 --> 13:48.514
new theories, mission profiles.

13:49.360 --> 13:51.920
I'm sorry. I must have seemed ignorant.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.868
I hardly said anything apart from "Geronimo".

13:58.760 --> 14:01.718
Thank you for the workout.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.992
Dress.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.752
Transmit.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.111
Privacy off.

14:11.280 --> 14:15.956
Commander, some amusing news. Stocky has
chosen you to meet our guest's challenge.

14:23.640 --> 14:28.156
What you're suggesting is immoral
and illegal. Mind-patching is outlawed.

14:28.360 --> 14:31.352
- But it IS possible?
- Possible but highly dangerous.

14:31.520 --> 14:36.310
The side effects can be devastating. You
could be reduced to a gibbering simpleton.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.277
Reduced?

14:39.520 --> 14:42.592
- I'll take the chance.
- Even if it costs your mind?

14:42.800 --> 14:44.950
It's a small price to pay.

14:46.160 --> 14:49.709
Look, on that ship I can touch, feel, taste.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.758
I'm not a half man. I'm whole again.

14:52.960 --> 14:58.557
Rimmer, they're a bunch of arrogant, pompous,
emotionally weird, stuck-up megalomaniacs.

14:58.720 --> 15:01.473
Do you really think you'll fit in?

15:01.640 --> 15:03.835
What am I saying? Bon voyage.

15:04.040 --> 15:06.793
He's right, sir.
Why throw in with people like that?

15:07.000 --> 15:12.552
To be somebody, to have a position
of authority on a scout ship exploring space,

15:12.720 --> 15:18.033
work alongside educated men and women,
officers, people who count.

15:18.200 --> 15:23.035
This is my one chance
to seize my dream, to be with the winners.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.590
- Look at me. What do you see?
- Tell me.

15:26.800 --> 15:32.432
You see a sad and lonely guy who left home
at 16 to become an officer and a gentleman

15:32.600 --> 15:35.433
and ended up
as a chicken soup machine operative.

15:35.600 --> 15:41.357
Is it any wonder my father had four strokes
and used to sit by the window and dribble?

15:41.520 --> 15:43.511
I did that to him. Me.

15:43.720 --> 15:47.349
There's nothing wrong
with what you did. It was just a job.

15:47.560 --> 15:51.075
- You ARE your job.
- Not so, sir.

15:51.240 --> 15:53.959
Was Albert Camus
a goalkeeper or a philosopher?

15:54.120 --> 15:59.194
Was Albert Einstein an office clerk
or the greatest physicist who ever lived?

15:59.360 --> 16:02.909
And, of course,
there's the simple carpenter's son

16:03.080 --> 16:08.200
who went on to own the largest chain
of pizza stores in history, Harry Beedlebaum.

16:08.400 --> 16:13.838
Einstein didn't spend the best years of his
life picking poultry from a nozzle cleaner.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.911
That doesn't make you a failure.

16:17.120 --> 16:21.159
It does in my parents' eyes.
It does in my brothers' eyes.

16:21.320 --> 16:26.348
It does in the eyes of everyone with eyes.
That's exactly what it makes me.

16:26.560 --> 16:29.393
Sir, please reconsider. If not for your sanity,

16:29.560 --> 16:32.836
you haven't considered
the moral implications of your decision.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.879
You will be joining a society
where you must have sex

16:37.040 --> 16:41.033
with beautiful, brilliant women
twice daily on demand.

16:41.200 --> 16:46.957
Now, am I really the only one here
who finds that just a little bit tacky?

16:49.920 --> 16:52.514
Well, quite clearly I am.

16:54.560 --> 16:58.838
Sir, I've uploaded the two candidates
to be inserted into your mind -

16:59.000 --> 17:03.710
Science Officer Buchan,
excellent scientific background, 169 IQ,

17:03.880 --> 17:09.238
and Flight Coordinator McQueen,
superlative mathematician, 172 IQ.

17:09.400 --> 17:13.996
Now, even taking into account the enormous
drag factor of your own mind,

17:14.160 --> 17:16.515
I still think we'll get something special.

17:16.720 --> 17:20.473
- But I'll still have control?
- You'll have access to their knowledge,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.358
but your personality
will have the power of veto.

17:23.520 --> 17:28.548
Sir, I implore you to reconsider. Think
of the poor officer whose life you will take.

17:28.760 --> 17:34.153
Wasn't it St Francis of Assisi who said,
"Never give a sucker an even break"?

17:34.360 --> 17:37.318
Well, if he did, sir,
it was strictly off the record.

17:37.920 --> 17:41.754
- Come on, Kryten. Get on with it.
- Commencing integration.

17:41.920 --> 17:44.753
Glory or insanity awaits.

17:47.480 --> 17:50.950
- He's read every medical book?
- In under three hours.

17:51.120 --> 17:54.669
The change is quite astonishing.
But I should warn you -

17:54.840 --> 17:59.391
this is not the pile of human wreckage
we know as Arnold Rimmer.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.676
Prepare yourself.

18:03.920 --> 18:08.596
Sir, we've received the co-ordinates.
Perhaps we should be... making tracks?

18:09.640 --> 18:10.959
Kry-ten.

18:11.120 --> 18:16.478
I was thinking. Assuming we're not dealing
with a basic Euclidean geometric universe

18:16.640 --> 18:20.952
and given that all geomathematics is based
on the notion that one plus one is two

18:21.120 --> 18:25.955
and not that one and two are in fact the same
thing observed from different precepts...

18:28.080 --> 18:31.834
.. the theoretical shape must therefore
be a polydridocdecahooeyhedron

18:32.000 --> 18:35.072
ahexasexahedroadicon
and a dibidollyhedecadodron.

18:36.920 --> 18:40.515
- Everything else is poppycock.
- Rimmer?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.995
I wrote a palindromic haiku this morning.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.675
- We don't speak Japanese, sir.
- I could translate it into Mandarin.

18:46.880 --> 18:52.591
Rimmer, we don't speak Japanese, we don't
speak Mandarin, and we don't speak satsuma.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.229
He is really getting on my pecks.

18:56.400 --> 18:59.676
Remember, sir,
he's operating on a different level now.

18:59.880 --> 19:03.759
To him, we are the intellectual equivalent
of domestic science teachers.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.430
Subject ready for transfer.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.558
Farewell, gentlemen. Glory awaits.

19:13.680 --> 19:18.913
Test candidates, for this purely intellectual
challenge, you remain in separate suites.

19:19.120 --> 19:23.398
Questions will come in a variety
of languages to confuse and disorient you.

19:23.600 --> 19:27.036
There will be 200,000 questions
in this initial session.

19:27.240 --> 19:31.791
After you have completed the tasks
at workstation A, proceed to workstation B.

19:32.000 --> 19:35.470
I shall undertake both tasks simultaneously.

19:35.680 --> 19:39.559
- Mr Rimmer, that is impossible.
- Nevertheless, I shall attempt it.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.151
It begins.

20:15.280 --> 20:18.590
You're exactly what we're looking for.
Are there any questions?

20:18.800 --> 20:23.032
I just want to get one thing clear.
This is an opportunity

20:23.200 --> 20:28.115
to be revived as a hologram
and become part of the crew - you three.

20:30.240 --> 20:35.917
Basically, you spend your time salvaging
spaceships, playing poker and eating curries.

20:36.440 --> 20:41.560
- We don't do that much salvaging.
- But you do eat a lot of curries.

20:41.720 --> 20:43.995
We don't eat curry every night.

20:44.160 --> 20:49.280
In fact, I remember quite clearly last June,
Mr Lister had a pizza. Remember?

20:49.440 --> 20:51.237
- Yeah.
- You didn't like it.

20:51.400 --> 20:55.359
But I poured curry sauce over it,
and he yummed it up.

20:55.560 --> 20:59.269
And the all-night poker sessions,
is it always strip poker?

20:59.480 --> 21:03.996
- It depends on how drunk we are.
- Or how much curry he's had.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.998
So - and this is probably a stupid question -

21:07.160 --> 21:10.470
you don't have much interest
in horse riding or ballet?

21:10.680 --> 21:15.390
Fine by us. As long as we can have
a curry afterwards, we're cool.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.154
Of course, there's other candidates to see,

21:18.320 --> 21:22.074
but, in theory, if we offered you the post,
would you accept?

21:22.520 --> 21:23.839
- No.
- No.

21:24.040 --> 21:28.352
- No, I think I'm better off where I am.
- But you're dead!

21:28.560 --> 21:33.634
And meeting you guys has really made me
appreciate it a whole lot more.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.910
Well, thank you, Ms Harrison.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.640
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Next.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.798
Next candidate, Deck Sergeant Sam Murray.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.952
Ah, Sam. Now, as Holly told you...

21:45.160 --> 21:47.833
- My own mind's come back!
- What happened exactly?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.709
Was it a slow deterioration
or did it happen in seconds?

21:51.880 --> 21:55.190
Seconds. I need another mind-patch pronto.

21:55.360 --> 22:00.388
I'm sorry, sir. It's classic rejection syndrome.
There's nothing we can do.

22:00.560 --> 22:06.635
- What are you talking about?
- Your brain just can't accept an implant.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.990
- No!
- I'm sorry, sir.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.509
- There must be something!
- I'm afraid not.

22:11.720 --> 22:14.439
But I'm winning, I'm so close... Who's this?

22:15.800 --> 22:18.268
I'm not even gone and you're replacing me!

22:18.480 --> 22:22.393
- We thought you weren't coming back.
- You should know better.

22:22.560 --> 22:27.350
You actually expect something to go right
for me? Arnold "Schmucko" Rimmer?

22:27.520 --> 22:30.432
Tosspot by Royal Appointment?

22:31.360 --> 22:33.715
Well, where are you going, sir?

22:35.200 --> 22:37.316
I'm going to withdraw.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.480
I hear you're doing well in the assessment.

22:46.920 --> 22:51.152
Well, if you make it,
maybe you'd like to have sex next week?

22:51.320 --> 22:56.758
- I'm free Wednesday morning.
- I'm busy Wednesday. I'm killing myself.

22:57.240 --> 23:00.710
Floor 6120- botanical gardens.

23:03.960 --> 23:05.996
Arnie, where've you been?

23:06.200 --> 23:08.191
To hell and back.

23:08.400 --> 23:10.994
- I've withdrawn.
- But you're winning.

23:11.200 --> 23:14.795
- I was using a mind-patch.
- Are you insane?!

23:15.800 --> 23:21.989
I would do anything to get on this ship.
Every time I look in the mirror, I see this.

23:22.160 --> 23:26.153
Only to me, it doesn't mean hologram,
it means "halfwit",

23:26.320 --> 23:29.198
"hopeless", "hideous failure".

23:29.360 --> 23:32.557
This was a chance to be somebody.
Somebody I liked.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.035
I've never met anyone like you before.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.152
- Everyone says that.
- Listen to me, mister.

23:38.320 --> 23:41.517
Underneath that neurotic mess
is someone nice,

23:41.720 --> 23:44.280
someone who deserves a chance to grow.

23:44.440 --> 23:47.671
So you won't give up, OK?

23:47.840 --> 23:51.310
- OK?
- I cheated.

23:51.520 --> 23:56.230
You're going to win, Arnie.
You will get your dream. I promise you.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.515
You really think?

24:03.920 --> 24:06.309
I really think.

24:19.760 --> 24:22.479
- I won.
- What?!

24:22.640 --> 24:27.953
My opponent withdrew. I won.
I'm an officer. I leave tonight.

24:31.400 --> 24:33.595
Look, I'm no good at speeches,

24:33.800 --> 24:37.759
and I know I haven't always
been easy to get on with.

24:37.920 --> 24:42.630
And, given the choice, I probably wouldn't
have chosen you as friends.

24:42.840 --> 24:46.992
But I just want to say that over the years,

24:47.160 --> 24:53.952
I have come to regard you
as... people... I met.

24:55.560 --> 24:59.917
- I'd just better go, OK?
- See you, smeghead.

25:00.080 --> 25:01.877
- Transfer.
- Transfer.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.434
Here are your quarters, Mr Rimmer.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.114
These are Commander Crane's quarters.

25:16.320 --> 25:19.198
Oh, didn't you know? She was your opponent.

25:29.120 --> 25:31.190
Navigation Officer Rimmer reporting, sir.

25:31.400 --> 25:35.029
Arnold, welcome aboard.
I trust everything's to your sa...

25:35.240 --> 25:37.037
Permission to speak, sir.

25:37.240 --> 25:40.073
I wish to resign my commission, sir.

25:40.240 --> 25:44.518
Resign. May I ask your reasoning, please?

25:44.720 --> 25:48.395
Flight Commander Crane
has fallen in love with me, sir.

25:48.600 --> 25:55.233
Love? Commander Crane is too intellectually
advanced to submit to a hormonal imbalance.

25:55.440 --> 25:58.398
That's why she withdrew
from the challenge, sir.

25:58.600 --> 26:03.958
You are suggesting that she cared more
for your happiness than for her own life.

26:04.160 --> 26:08.358
Am I? Yes, sir. I suppose I am, sir.

26:08.560 --> 26:12.109
Now you are resigning
so that she can be reinstated,

26:12.280 --> 26:14.350
even though you could have everything -

26:14.560 --> 26:18.917
a position of command,
an effective physical presence, everything.

26:19.080 --> 26:22.755
Perhaps you'd pass this note on to her, sir.

26:22.960 --> 26:26.157
I understand your gesture,
but your resignation solves nothing.

26:26.320 --> 26:28.834
After all, you will still be... apart.

26:29.040 --> 26:32.715
- Permission to return to Red Dwarf, sir.
- Granted.

26:39.560 --> 26:41.949
Oh, and, sir, you're wrong.

26:42.120 --> 26:46.432
We won't be apart,
we just... won't be together.

26:50.520 --> 26:53.910
I cannot believe I just said that.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.830
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

27:07.000 --> 27:10.276
# I'm all alone, more or less

27:10.440 --> 27:13.557
# Let me fly far away from here

27:13.720 --> 27:16.393
# Fun, fun, fun

27:16.560 --> 27:20.075
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:20.240 --> 27:23.471
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

27:23.640 --> 27:26.791
# Drinking fresh mango juice

27:26.960 --> 27:30.191
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

27:30.360 --> 27:32.999
# Fun, fun, fun

27:33.160 --> 27:36.709
# In the sun, sun, sun

27:36.880 --> 27:39.599
# Fun, fun, fun

27:39.760 --> 27:44.231
# In the sun, sun, sun #
