00:05.760 --> 00:09.160
I am very fixed about
how I dress, what I do,

00:09.240 --> 00:10.400
what I don't do.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.160
This is completely out of my comfort zone.

00:13.360 --> 00:16.400
I think I have about 15 minutes to panic.

00:52.920 --> 00:56.840
Hi, I'm your host and part-time
video call hater, Sapan Verma,

00:56.920 --> 00:59.920
and on today's episode,
we have two proud pet parents

01:00.000 --> 01:01.840
who love to give us some positive news.

01:02.400 --> 01:05.440
TV news anchor turned
Instagram journalist Faye D'souza

01:05.720 --> 01:08.600
and the daddy cool
of Indian comedy, Atul Khatri.

01:08.880 --> 01:10.200
Thank you so much for coming!

01:10.280 --> 01:13.840
My name is Atul Khatri
and I am 52 years old.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.800
Yeah, usually I get a clap around here.
Come on, come on.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.120
Because at the age of 52,

01:21.200 --> 01:23.720
I'm India's oldest
English stand-up comedian.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.000
No, no, I don't get a clap here.
It's only for the age.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.560
And doing stand-up comedy at
this age is very tough. It's very tough!

01:31.200 --> 01:32.200
No, it's not the talking part.

01:32.280 --> 01:34.800
You know, as we guys get older,
we can speak for hours.

01:37.080 --> 01:38.960
It's the damn standing part
which is a problem.

01:41.960 --> 01:43.360
I love my daughters.
I love my daughters

01:43.440 --> 01:46.960
and I thank God every day
for giving me two daughters, honestly!

01:47.360 --> 01:48.720
Because I couldn't have handled sons.

01:48.800 --> 01:51.440
Because I know bloody what a
rascal of a son I've been to my parents.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.280
And I think, after so many years,
I've figured my daughters out, you know.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.160
Once every two-three months,
take them to H&M and Zara for shopping.

02:00.040 --> 02:01.920
Once every two-three years,
upgrade their iPhones.

02:02.600 --> 02:04.600
Instagram accounts,
Snapchat accounts… set!

02:04.760 --> 02:06.320
Poor girls don't ask for anything more.

02:07.640 --> 02:10.640
Sons, bloody, right from the beginning,
they want your cycle, your motorcycle,

02:10.760 --> 02:12.000
your shoes, your belt,

02:12.120 --> 02:13.880
name in your property, career, will…

02:13.960 --> 02:15.040
It never ends!

02:17.440 --> 02:19.720
You've heard of sons
fighting over property, correct?

02:20.320 --> 02:22.960
My two daughters
fight over a 200-rupee kajal pencil.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.400
Last year, my elder daughter
came and told me, "Papa,

02:28.520 --> 02:31.040
I want to go for a
backpacking trip to Croatia."

02:31.680 --> 02:34.040
I said, "Amazing! First of all,
show me where Croatia is on the map."

02:36.160 --> 02:37.800
See, I have these two
simple rules with my daughter.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.880
If you have to go somewhere,
show me where it is on the map.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.040
And if you have to go to a music concert,
make me hear the lyrics.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.280
Because many years back, I went
with them to a Justin Bieber concert.

02:46.400 --> 02:47.680
And it was not what it promised to be.

02:51.680 --> 02:53.000
So, we have that globe at home.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.960
She looked for ten minutes,
but could not find Croatia there.

02:56.040 --> 02:58.040
Then she looked it up on Google maps,
it was close to Italy.

02:58.520 --> 03:01.240
I said, "Dear, why do you want to
go all the way to Croatia? So far away!"

03:01.520 --> 03:03.320
She's like,
"Dad, Croatia has got a lot of history!"

03:03.800 --> 03:05.440
I said, "What history does Croatia have?"

03:06.120 --> 03:07.960
She said, "Dad,
the Lannisters were born there!

03:09.600 --> 03:12.400
Cersei Lannister,
Jaime Lannister, Tyrion Lannister.

03:12.920 --> 03:14.960
Dad, the battle of Blackwater
Bay was fought there."

03:15.720 --> 03:17.760
Sir, I think you are lost.
It's a Game of Thrones reference.

03:18.760 --> 03:21.600
She said, "Dad,
book premium economy tickets for me."

03:21.720 --> 03:23.840
I said, "Bloody, you are going
backpacking. Fly economy."

03:23.960 --> 03:25.920
She said, "No, no, no.
I need extra legroom space."

03:26.120 --> 03:28.920
I said, "Dear, we're a family of hobbits.
We all have short legs."

03:30.720 --> 03:32.480
But I knew why it was called backpacking.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.160
Because of the amount of
money she spent on the trip,

03:35.640 --> 03:37.520
all I was left with was
a backpack of clothes on my shoulder.

03:37.600 --> 03:38.600
All my money was spent!

03:40.120 --> 03:41.800
Right, so what happened
at three o'clock in the morning,

03:41.880 --> 03:43.480
my elder daughter flew to Croatia.

03:43.840 --> 03:46.600
She stole the kajal pencil
from the dressing table, she flew off.

03:47.800 --> 03:50.360
In the morning, my younger daughter
got up, getting ready for college.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.720
She couldn't find the kajal pencil.
She knew she had stolen.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.680
She came banging into my room, "Dad!"

03:54.800 --> 03:55.680
I said, "What happened?"

03:55.760 --> 03:57.240
"Give me your phone!"
I said, "What's wrong?"

03:57.320 --> 03:59.600
"That <i>kutti</i> has taken
my kajal pencil to Croatia!"

04:04.040 --> 04:06.840
I'm like, "Mind your language!
It's not <i>kutti,</i> it's bitch!

04:10.000 --> 04:11.280
You can't mix two languages

04:11.360 --> 04:13.320
and you cannot call her to Croatia
using my phone!"

04:13.840 --> 04:15.560
She said, "No dad,
I don't have balance in my phone."

04:16.520 --> 04:18.480
This is a problem with every child.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.120
All day, when they're talking
to each other, they have enough balance.

04:21.320 --> 04:22.600
No balance for an important call!

04:23.240 --> 04:24.920
But see, I'm also old.
I've been through history.

04:25.320 --> 04:26.920
I know the divide
and rule policy, correct?

04:27.360 --> 04:28.520
So I said, "Good! Fight."

04:28.600 --> 04:30.080
I gave my phone and said,
"Fight with each other."

04:31.000 --> 04:33.560
And one thing I've seen, when
both my daughters fight with each other,

04:33.640 --> 04:35.000
they fight like cats and dogs.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.880
But if you scold one
child in front of the other,

04:38.240 --> 04:39.920
suddenly, they bloody gang up
like thieves.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.320
Suddenly, it's like Pakistan
and China against India…

04:45.360 --> 04:47.560
"Dad, how dare you
speak to my sister like that?"

04:48.160 --> 04:49.600
I said, "Wow!
She was a bitch a couple of days ago,

04:49.680 --> 04:50.920
now she's your sister? Wow!"

04:55.240 --> 04:57.680
One thing now I've seen,
you know, both my daughters and wife

04:57.760 --> 04:58.920
have become like best of friends,
you know.

04:59.040 --> 05:00.440
They fit into each other's clothes,

05:00.560 --> 05:02.360
they go partying together,
they go shopping together.

05:02.520 --> 05:04.320
They cry together, they laugh together.

05:04.520 --> 05:05.680
Yeah, they even cry together!

05:06.480 --> 05:08.560
Once I came from a show,
all three of them were crying.

05:10.040 --> 05:10.800
I said, "What happened?"

05:10.920 --> 05:12.920
Apparently, one of them
had fought with their boyfriend.

05:14.240 --> 05:15.800
Not my wife, you bastards!

05:21.120 --> 05:22.560
And I was very very upset.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.920
Because at that time,
you know, another man had made

05:25.040 --> 05:26.920
three of my favorite women in life cry.

05:27.360 --> 05:30.200
And true story, I was very
very upset because at that time,

05:30.360 --> 05:32.800
I was sharing that boyfriend's
Amazon Prime password.

05:34.880 --> 05:38.400
I didn't want to miss <i>Mirzapur</i>
just because of a stupid fight, man.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.080
Thank you, friends, Atul Khatri.

05:40.160 --> 05:41.680
You've been such a fabulous audience!

05:41.880 --> 05:42.800
Thank you so much!

05:48.560 --> 05:49.880
-Mr. Atul Khatri!
-Yes, sir!

05:49.960 --> 05:51.120
Welcome to One Mic Stand.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.200
Thank you so much for having me!

05:52.320 --> 05:54.760
See, we got such a lovely
venue for you. Rooftop!

05:55.240 --> 05:56.680
Obviously, for my class, you have to get…

05:56.800 --> 05:58.160
Yeah, we have to match your class.

05:58.640 --> 05:59.480
But tell me something.

05:59.600 --> 06:02.520
You have met Faye before?
You've worked with her or something?

06:02.600 --> 06:05.280
Yeah, obviously, I've come
for one or two of her debates.

06:05.360 --> 06:09.440
But in 2018, like two years back,
she gave me an award for,

06:09.520 --> 06:12.120
like, some Best Stand-up Comedian of 2018.

06:12.200 --> 06:13.920
-It was one of these awards in Delhi.
-Yeah.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.520
So, I was a little
skeptical about the awards,

06:15.600 --> 06:17.520
but because Faye gave it to me, I think…

06:17.600 --> 06:19.040
you know,
there was some legitimacy to it.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.280
And I think it's like a complete
circle that now today, I'm mentoring her.

06:22.360 --> 06:24.440
Yeah, you have to mentor
her as the best comedian.

06:24.520 --> 06:25.400
So, no pressure.

06:25.480 --> 06:26.760
This is your test more than hers.

06:26.920 --> 06:27.880
-Okay.
-Let's see how it goes.

06:28.680 --> 06:29.600
Hello, hello, hello!

06:29.680 --> 06:30.960
Hi! How are you doing?

06:31.040 --> 06:31.920
Are we doing elbows?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.280
-Elbow bumps.
-Fist bump.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.640
Different ones for different people.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.800
I have a question for you.

06:38.920 --> 06:41.760
Why did you want to get mentored
by Atul Khatri, of all the people?

06:42.120 --> 06:44.000
Because all the rest of your
comedians were younger than me.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.400
So you have been watching
comedy here and there?

06:49.520 --> 06:51.000
Yes, back from like, you know,

06:51.080 --> 06:53.280
when Russell Peters
became really popular in India

06:53.360 --> 06:54.960
and, you know, even before that.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.800
And it's amazing what,
like, comedy has done in India.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.760
Have you gone out to watch
like, live stand-up comedy?

07:00.840 --> 07:01.800
-Yes.
-You and your husband, like,

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
buy tickets and go and watch?

07:03.080 --> 07:04.440
-Buy tickets and go and watch.
-Nice.

07:04.520 --> 07:06.200
A lot of times,
date night would be, like, comedy.

07:06.280 --> 07:10.000
But we'd always be sure to
sit in like fourth or fifth row,

07:10.080 --> 07:11.200
so you don't get picked on.

07:11.320 --> 07:13.000
I did one show where there was,
I won't name,

07:13.080 --> 07:15.560
but a very senior Bollywood
actor sitting in the front row.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.600
And obviously, he was watching
our kind of stand-up for the first time.

07:19.120 --> 07:21.000
And after every joke,
he was saying "Excellent!

07:21.840 --> 07:23.680
Wow! Marvelous!"
Like, you know…

07:24.720 --> 07:25.880
-Like…
-He's used to poetry conventions.

07:25.960 --> 07:27.920
Every time he did that,
people around him were laughing.

07:28.440 --> 07:30.120
But he was so cute,
I didn't want to pull him down

07:30.200 --> 07:31.680
and say, "Sir, this is a
different kind of show…

07:31.760 --> 07:33.040
You should have done this…

07:33.120 --> 07:35.520
It's not a comedy poets
convention or anything…"

07:36.720 --> 07:38.560
So, you guys don't test
your stuff on people?

07:39.000 --> 07:39.880
We do. Open mics.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.360
So my rule is, I write in the night,
supposing I find it very funny.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.800
In the morning, I again read
it to see if it is still funny.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.160
And then I would probably run it
with my daughters and my wife or something

07:48.480 --> 07:49.920
and my wife and my relation is such that

07:50.000 --> 07:52.200
if she says it's a horrible joke,
it does best on stage!

07:52.920 --> 07:55.520
Or if she says this is the best joke,
nobody laughs also.

07:55.600 --> 07:56.720
So, this is the relation--
And my daughter.

07:56.800 --> 07:57.960
But you have a lot of like…

07:58.040 --> 08:00.440
Your life story is interesting,
how you started and where you are.

08:00.600 --> 08:02.200
And this massive shift you have made,

08:02.280 --> 08:03.600
-which is a big thing to do…
-Yeah, yeah.

08:03.680 --> 08:06.280
I don't want to say "At that age"
because that I reserve for Atul.

08:06.720 --> 08:07.560
Not for you.

08:07.640 --> 08:09.440
You know, here's the funny thing, right?

08:09.960 --> 08:13.560
In television,
I was India's youngest woman editor

08:13.840 --> 08:15.360
and then I moved to the internet

08:16.080 --> 08:17.760
and now people are saying "At that age"!

08:20.000 --> 08:23.400
And I'm like, "At what age? What age?
What age are you talking about?"

08:23.480 --> 08:25.600
It's the platform that
decides your age, actually.

08:25.680 --> 08:27.400
Here, 14-year-olds have
millions of subscribers.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.000
Yeah! So, on Instagram, I'm like old now.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.600
-The space is evolving constantly.
-Every day!

08:32.680 --> 08:33.600
-Correct.
-Yeah.

08:33.680 --> 08:36.680
And you have to keep finding
new ways to stay relevant.

08:36.960 --> 08:38.960
But I realize the common
connection of yours,

08:39.040 --> 08:40.600
is that both of you
are dog parents.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.840
And your Instagram followers
are shooting up after that.

08:42.880 --> 08:43.760
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yes.

08:43.880 --> 08:46.840
You know the funny thing is that
at least in my building,

08:47.760 --> 08:48.760
I am Pheobe's mom.

08:49.720 --> 08:51.600
Nobody knows me as me, you know.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.480
So, everybody knows me because of the dog.

08:53.640 --> 08:55.280
And so this lady was
really fond of the dog

08:55.360 --> 08:56.640
and she said,
"I want to take a photograph."

08:56.720 --> 08:58.360
And I was like okay,
so she took a photograph

08:58.440 --> 08:59.880
and I happened to be in the background.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.720
Then she came back the next day
and she said,

09:01.760 --> 09:03.520
"You are a newsreader?"

09:03.640 --> 09:04.520
I said yes.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.760
So, she said, "I sent
your photograph to my son

09:07.960 --> 09:11.600
and he said, "Hey, isn't she like,
so and so, the newsreader?"

09:11.640 --> 09:14.360
She said, "No, no, she is some
simple girl who stays in my building."

09:14.480 --> 09:16.640
-"She's Pheobe's mother."
-"She's Pheobe's mother."

09:16.880 --> 09:18.640
What does it mean, "She is a simple girl?"

09:20.000 --> 09:21.640
If I want to ask you
if you want to tell her

09:21.760 --> 09:23.640
one thing for her
performance on Saturday.

09:23.960 --> 09:27.320
Stand-up comedy around the world,
if you've seen some of the new specials

09:27.400 --> 09:29.960
of leading comedians,
you sometimes get a clap

09:30.080 --> 09:31.760
even at an emotional bit.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.960
-And that's okay in comedy.
-Yeah.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.440
It's become fairly storytelling.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.360
It's not just setup-punch, setup-punch.

09:37.480 --> 09:38.840
You can take a story.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.520
That entire story may
not have a funny thing.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.320
-It may have a nice emotional message,
-Yeah.

09:43.400 --> 09:45.200
which would maybe also
give you a standing ovation.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.120
It's not just about delivering the laughs.

09:47.240 --> 09:48.840
But now, we want to learn
something from you.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.600
Because we do a segment
called Role Reversal.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.120
And we should learn something from you.

09:52.360 --> 09:55.120
So, all of the stuff I know
is all television stuff.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.520
I will teach you whatever I know.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.760
-Okay.
-It should take five minutes.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.520
That's great,
that's what we're looking for.

09:59.640 --> 10:01.000
Let's go.
Let's do this.

10:03.280 --> 10:06.200
Basically, learning how to be
a TV anchor is a three-step process.

10:06.280 --> 10:07.720
Step one is you get a jacket.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.440
Step two: You have to have your table.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.200
I like to also… have pens.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.520
-You can never have too many pens.
-So many!

10:14.880 --> 10:17.240
When you show emotion,
you might lose your pen.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.520
You have to always have another one.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.840
Depending on how you deliver news,

10:21.440 --> 10:23.000
-anything can be news.
-Okay.

10:23.080 --> 10:27.160
So say, for example,
we say that a local couple

10:27.880 --> 10:30.480
have decided to call
themselves COVID positive,

10:31.000 --> 10:34.240
so they don't want to invite
uncles and aunties to their wedding.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.160
Nice!

10:35.280 --> 10:36.760
You first take that stance, right?

10:37.160 --> 10:38.280
-Oh, like this.
-Anchors have this--

10:38.360 --> 10:39.200
Yeah.

10:39.280 --> 10:42.520
Local couple calls
themselves COVID positive

10:43.080 --> 10:48.000
to avoid inviting uncles
and aunties to their wedding!

10:50.440 --> 10:52.280
-Have to stare, it's very…
-That pause is very important.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.200
Very important!

10:53.280 --> 10:55.760
Audiences should take in
how much injustice is happening

10:55.880 --> 10:57.400
-to uncle and aunt, right?
-Right.

10:57.480 --> 10:58.640
So, that is the second part.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.680
And the third part
is obviously the camera,

11:00.760 --> 11:02.200
which I will go to the camera and do.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.160
-But come. You can try.
-Come on, Atul. Go for it.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.240
The pens…

11:08.520 --> 11:09.440
So, you have to be bigger, man!

11:09.520 --> 11:11.480
So, like, push your hand down
on the table.

11:11.560 --> 11:13.080
-Yeah, like this?
-Yeah. Lean forward.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.480
-Lean forward.
-Be angry.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.760
So, as an audience, I feel like
I'm standing in front of this man

11:17.960 --> 11:20.560
who's leaning in on me cause
what he's saying is so important!

11:21.080 --> 11:24.880
This year, the film awards
will be held at the NCB office,

11:25.360 --> 11:26.720
since they're anyway present there.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.080
Atul, what was that?

11:32.320 --> 11:33.760
-Do you wanna try? You wanna try?
-Yes, of course.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.840
So, okay. Sapan, give me a stance.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.120
Now, I wanna show you
a new camera trick, right?

11:39.200 --> 11:40.520
-Okay.
-So, we call this the cobra,

11:40.600 --> 11:42.600
where the camera is doing its own thing.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.880
So, you have to just
constantly follow the lens.

11:44.960 --> 11:46.800
-Oh, I have to follow that also.
-He will come in,

11:46.920 --> 11:48.680
he will go out,
he will move around.

11:48.880 --> 11:54.320
The idea is, this pointless,
needless movement adds stress.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.720
-Yeah.
-Three, two, one, cue.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.440
Breaking news!

11:58.800 --> 12:02.720
Local vegetable vendor Rakesh
becomes the richest man in India

12:02.880 --> 12:05.080
after hoarding two dozen avocados.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.200
-I love the fireworks and the…
-There was a flare!

12:10.320 --> 12:11.560
-Wow!
-It was amazing!

12:13.760 --> 12:15.200
You are now a news anchor,

12:15.280 --> 12:16.640
which is different from a journalist.
Let's not--

12:16.720 --> 12:17.800
-That's true.
-Yes.

12:17.880 --> 12:20.920
So, news anchoring is a skill,
journalism is a profession.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.680
-Keep that joke
-Keep that joke.

12:22.760 --> 12:23.680
-It's a good joke.
-It's a nice joke.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.200
Yeah, yeah.
But thank you so much for doing this!

12:25.280 --> 12:26.840
-This was a lot of fun!
-This was fun

12:26.920 --> 12:28.200
and now comes the nervous bit.

12:28.720 --> 12:29.640
So…

12:39.240 --> 12:40.520
-Hey!
-Hello!

12:40.600 --> 12:41.480
Come, come, come.

12:45.080 --> 12:46.600
-So, are you all set?
-Yeah.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.120
-You slept well at night?
-Yes.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.320
-Fresh?
-Yes.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.320
-Excited?
-Yeah.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.120
-How are you feeling?
-Obviously nervous.

12:52.720 --> 12:54.880
You look very chilled out
for somebody who's

12:54.960 --> 12:56.600
doing stand-up for the first time.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.400
No! So, this is me, right?

12:58.480 --> 13:00.600
-This is like me before an exam.
-Yeah.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.600
I will do whatever I can
do and then after that,

13:02.680 --> 13:04.120
dude, I can't do more than this.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.480
-Now, it's like, whatever.
-Right. Good.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.360
So, I'm in that space now, which is

13:07.440 --> 13:08.680
I've done whatever.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.720
I can't do anymore
"by-heartings" than this.

13:12.640 --> 13:14.160
I mean, this is me.
So, I'm not one of those people

13:14.240 --> 13:16.200
who get like completely psyched.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.600
I'm one of those who has
slow breakfast on exam day.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.880
See, the main reason we do this show

13:24.960 --> 13:26.480
is so that we get really popular people

13:26.800 --> 13:28.960
and see them be really scared
before the show.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.240
That's the joy of seeing how she'll panic

13:31.400 --> 13:32.600
and she's not scared at all.

13:34.520 --> 13:37.880
As I keep saying,
hold the mic like you eat a banana.

13:38.160 --> 13:39.880
Why does that sound wrong to me?

13:39.960 --> 13:42.880
It does, but it also makes
sense once you start using it.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.480
Okay. This is the banana.

13:44.640 --> 13:46.640
-At one point, if I choose,
-Yes?

13:46.720 --> 13:48.080
-can I sit on the stool?
-Of course!

13:48.160 --> 13:49.680
Wow, you're adding theatrics to this?

13:51.800 --> 13:53.120
Where is my spotlight?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.680
Give her a spotlight, please.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.160
That's it.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.040
He who laughs at himself
never runs out of things to laugh at.

14:00.120 --> 14:00.960
-See?
-Aw!

14:01.080 --> 14:03.040
That's a useful thing to remember.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.920
People in my team would be really proud,

14:06.000 --> 14:08.240
because I'm otherwise grumpy and serious.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.960
So, it'll be a different
side of me to sort of show people.

14:19.760 --> 14:23.560
I realized that Indian
dads love watching TV news.

14:23.920 --> 14:24.800
Yeah?

14:24.880 --> 14:25.880
They love watching it.

14:26.960 --> 14:27.880
All the time!

14:28.160 --> 14:29.400
Like, I'm binge-watching <i>Mirzapur,</i>

14:29.480 --> 14:31.080
my dad is binge-watching Aaj Tak.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.840
My dad watches the news
the entire day, dude!

14:35.120 --> 14:37.760
I think he thinks that
a 24-hour news channel means

14:37.840 --> 14:39.760
he has to literally watch it for 24 hours.

14:41.240 --> 14:42.160
Full day!

14:43.200 --> 14:45.200
He thinks if he stops watching,
they will stop talking!

14:47.080 --> 14:48.200
He'll watch the news all day.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.160
Next day morning, 7:00 am, newspaper.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.440
I was like, "Dad, they've printed
the same things you watched yesterday."

14:53.920 --> 14:55.200
He's like, "Yeah. It's called revision."

14:59.000 --> 15:01.600
And earlier, to become a news anchor,

15:01.680 --> 15:04.280
you needed a degree in journalism, right?

15:04.560 --> 15:06.800
Now, you need an acting course from FTII.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.920
Right? Because you
can't just deliver the news.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.760
Now you have to perform,
over-perform, exaggerate. Right?

15:14.840 --> 15:16.080
In this lockdown,

15:16.200 --> 15:18.480
something called Cyclone
Nisarga had come to Maharashtra.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.520
Thankfully, nothing much
happened in Mumbai.

15:20.600 --> 15:21.800
We all survived.

15:22.040 --> 15:24.000
But there was one journalist
standing outside the Ministry.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.840
Full overacting,
like, "Strong winds are blowing!

15:28.120 --> 15:29.680
I am not able to stand straight here.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.680
Strong winds, cyclone, storm!"

15:33.520 --> 15:35.120
There's a man picking garbage behind him!

15:36.680 --> 15:38.560
Neither that man nor the garbage
is affected by the wind!

15:39.200 --> 15:40.800
But this guy is going on and on.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.800
You know what,
compared to all this media circus,

15:44.000 --> 15:46.320
I prefer the Doordarshan news of the 90s.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.800
So much better, right?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.960
News used to come twice
a day for five minutes each.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.920
And to be a news anchor on DD News,

15:52.000 --> 15:53.320
you had to be dead inside.

15:55.560 --> 15:58.280
Right? No emotions,
no expressions whatsoever.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.920
Even Alexa has more emotions
than a DD News anchor!

16:01.760 --> 16:04.000
That man would deliver both
happy and sad news in the same tone.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.360
You wouldn't understand what is what!

16:06.040 --> 16:08.120
He's like,
"Five soldiers injured on the border.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.320
India has won the World Cup."

16:11.960 --> 16:13.120
What are you saying?

16:14.520 --> 16:17.520
Alright! Your surprise guest for tonight

16:17.920 --> 16:20.640
is one of the most powerful
voices of Indian journalism.

16:20.760 --> 16:24.120
She's a news anchor turned digital
and Instagram journalist.

16:24.360 --> 16:29.240
Please give it up for
the very cool Faye D'souza!

16:46.000 --> 16:48.400
Thank you! You are very kind.
My name is Faye D'souza.

16:48.480 --> 16:49.920
I'm doing the comedy tonight.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.120
Thank you, sir.
But that was not the joke.

16:55.200 --> 16:58.080
So, when Sapan called me
and asked me to do stand-up comedy,

16:58.160 --> 17:00.120
I was like, "Whoa!
I've never done that before."

17:00.520 --> 17:01.760
But then I was like, "I'm a TV anchor…

17:03.920 --> 17:04.840
You know?

17:06.360 --> 17:07.640
How different can it be?"

17:08.360 --> 17:09.800
But if you consider and
think about it, right?

17:09.920 --> 17:14.080
One is about stating facts,
asking the right questions,

17:14.320 --> 17:15.960
holding the government responsible.

17:17.080 --> 17:18.240
The other is TV news.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.960
So, when a male anchor puts on a suit

17:24.720 --> 17:27.240
and shouts really
loudly to make his point,

17:31.800 --> 17:35.440
people say,
"This must be the truth. Period."

17:37.040 --> 17:39.800
When I put on a suit and raise my voice,

17:39.960 --> 17:43.080
people will say, "Hmm.
She must be on her period."

17:46.720 --> 17:47.800
But now that I'm not on TV,

17:47.880 --> 17:50.440
I can share some inside
jokes with you guys.

17:50.680 --> 17:52.160
So, you know these panelists,

17:52.280 --> 17:55.040
who are opposing politicians
from opposing parties.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.160
Behind the scenes,
the things are very different.

17:58.320 --> 18:01.200
So, when the channel is on,
they're all like, "How dare you?

18:01.320 --> 18:02.800
You do not respect minorities!

18:02.920 --> 18:04.080
You do not respect women!

18:04.160 --> 18:06.160
I hate everything about your soul!"

18:06.760 --> 18:07.960
It'll go into break and they'll be like,

18:08.320 --> 18:11.960
"This saree is nice, right?
Where did you buy it from?"

18:13.440 --> 18:16.440
But I've genuinely gotten
angry a couple of times.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.440
Okay, maybe three times on my show.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.760
And I've regretted it later
because I used to call my panelists

18:22.800 --> 18:25.080
and apologize whenever
I lost my shit on air.

18:25.240 --> 18:28.560
Because I realized,
it's not fair to invite a clown

18:29.080 --> 18:31.200
and then get angry
at him for clowning, right?

18:32.560 --> 18:33.800
Why did you invite
them in the first place?

18:35.080 --> 18:38.560
You shouldn't technically shame
someone for their opinions on a show.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.320
We have Twitter for that.

18:44.280 --> 18:47.880
So, I decided that there'll
be no shouting on my show.

18:48.320 --> 18:51.080
And the people who are most
surprised by this were the panelists!

18:52.320 --> 18:53.200
This is a true story.

18:53.280 --> 18:56.480
I had one panelist
who was making a really spirited point

18:56.560 --> 18:57.440
and he stopped.

18:59.480 --> 19:02.560
He thought the video was frozen
because nobody was interrupting him!

19:09.200 --> 19:13.480
It was for all these wonderful things
that last year, I quit television news

19:14.280 --> 19:15.560
to pursue my true passion…

19:16.240 --> 19:17.160
Journalism.

19:21.560 --> 19:25.640
When I quit, a lot of people
got really concerned about me.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.320
And in the last one year,

19:28.520 --> 19:30.800
when TV news has revealed itself

19:31.240 --> 19:35.920
for the TRP-hungry,
mindless, crazy drama that it really is,

19:36.520 --> 19:38.280
I seem like a visionary now!

19:43.000 --> 19:46.920
But when I quit, I was put
on something called "Gardening leave".

19:47.640 --> 19:49.720
But for those of you who
don't know what gardening leave is,

19:49.800 --> 19:51.320
it's an HR policy.

19:51.680 --> 19:54.400
It's a notice period designed
to take you out of the game.

19:54.760 --> 19:59.080
So, you get paid your salary
but you don't go to the office.

19:59.320 --> 20:00.880
And you don't work
for anybody else either.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.320
But there's something
I wanna share with you guys

20:03.560 --> 20:07.240
that I have never spoken
about in public until now.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.880
The gardening leave was hard, right?

20:11.960 --> 20:14.680
Because I had been working
for 16 years till then.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.320
And every day at about
8:30 in the morning,

20:17.560 --> 20:19.560
when there's this beehive
activity in the building, right,

20:19.680 --> 20:20.560
in all of our buildings?

20:20.680 --> 20:21.520
People are going to work.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.880
Lunchboxes, Ola cabs…

20:22.960 --> 20:24.760
There's all this, like, buzz.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.000
I would have panic attacks.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.160
Like, I would genuinely panic.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.800
And it got worse and worse
every day until it reached a point

20:36.200 --> 20:37.760
where it became a physical pain.

20:38.280 --> 20:42.760
And that's when I realized that I
would need to get real professional help.

20:43.000 --> 20:48.320
So, I got in touch with a therapist
and I fixed my first appointment.

20:50.080 --> 20:55.520
And the doctor very sweetly said that,
"Listen, I have a backdoor.

20:55.880 --> 20:59.560
And if you wanna avoid the public gaze,
come in through the backdoor."

20:59.880 --> 21:02.040
And I thought about it and I was like,
"Public gaze?"

21:03.680 --> 21:04.520
"Me?"

21:06.080 --> 21:09.160
It's not like the paparazzi
is following me around as "Spotted!

21:10.320 --> 21:12.080
Faye D'souza in therapy look…

21:13.280 --> 21:15.240
wearing a jacket by Manish Malhotra,

21:16.160 --> 21:18.560
and eye bags by crippling anxiety!"

21:23.920 --> 21:25.080
But jokes aside,

21:25.440 --> 21:30.040
I had attached too much of my
self-esteem and my self-worth to my job.

21:30.640 --> 21:31.520
Because this is what we do.

21:31.560 --> 21:33.760
We work weekends, we work late nights.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.480
We work through personal tragedy,
we work through illness.

21:36.680 --> 21:40.080
I mean, if you were to
take leave in this country…

21:41.080 --> 21:44.800
Assume you fractured your leg
and you sent an email to HR to take leave.

21:44.920 --> 21:48.240
HR will write back saying, "Next
time, please give prior intimation.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.680
This is very last-minute.

21:52.760 --> 21:53.800
There's a client meeting."

21:54.520 --> 21:57.680
So, I decided to do one thing
that will not affect my self-esteem.

21:58.280 --> 21:59.400
I joined Instagram.

22:02.080 --> 22:05.880
But the funny thing is that in order to
be able to communicate with young people,

22:05.960 --> 22:08.080
you have to be able to
talk to them in their language.

22:08.240 --> 22:10.240
So, you can't say like--
We would say in the news,

22:10.320 --> 22:11.520
"Actress turned politician

22:11.600 --> 22:15.280
Urmila Matondkar, who unsuccessfully
contested the 2019 election

22:15.400 --> 22:17.600
has now moved from Congress to Shiv Sena."

22:18.800 --> 22:19.680
You have to say, "Bro…

22:21.960 --> 22:23.640
That Rangeela chick, Urmila, she's made…

22:29.160 --> 22:31.240
Bro, she made a
mid-season transfer, dude,

22:32.200 --> 22:33.600
from Congress to Shiv Sena."

22:39.120 --> 22:40.720
I have to check my cards because

22:41.480 --> 22:44.160
I'm not one of those journalists who
can just make shit up as they go along.

22:50.720 --> 22:53.200
For reference,
I am not an Instagram journalist.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.760
I am a journalist who
happens to be on Instagram.

22:56.600 --> 22:57.480
There is a difference.

22:58.240 --> 22:59.680
Cause when you call
me an Instagram journalist,

22:59.800 --> 23:02.200
I sound like one of
those influencers, right,

23:02.560 --> 23:05.040
who deliver news like the influencer.
"Hi, guys!

23:06.360 --> 23:07.920
It's newswoman FD.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.000
I'm dropping some truth bombs!

23:12.880 --> 23:15.080
There was a cyclone last night,
it was like woot!

23:17.480 --> 23:20.120
But don't worry,
you can get 20% off on your next vacation

23:20.200 --> 23:23.440
by using my vacation code FAYECATION!

23:23.560 --> 23:27.200
Can I get an OP Disaster in the chat?"

23:30.480 --> 23:32.040
But being on the internet is fun!

23:32.120 --> 23:35.040
When you are on television,
if you say something about another anchor,

23:35.160 --> 23:36.680
they'll slap you with a defamation suit.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.160
On YouTube, they just roast you.

23:41.320 --> 23:44.120
Like, if I were to put out a video saying,
"Sapan Verma,

23:44.280 --> 23:46.120
your jokes are so low, man,

23:46.200 --> 23:47.960
they now resemble the Indian GDP."

23:53.160 --> 23:55.880
Sapan wouldn't hit me
with a defamation suit because…

23:56.640 --> 23:58.120
Sapan cannot afford a lawyer!

24:02.160 --> 24:04.560
But honestly, I shouldn't laugh because…

24:06.280 --> 24:07.920
I can't afford anything either.

24:08.920 --> 24:10.200
Like if you've seen my videos lately,

24:10.280 --> 24:14.560
I shoot them in my living room
with the front camera of my phone.

24:15.200 --> 24:16.680
And my husband is holding the phone.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.120
So, he's my tripod.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.960
And my dog is my studio audience.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.240
And sometimes, the dog is also a panelist.

24:25.240 --> 24:26.680
But it's more authentic because

24:26.760 --> 24:29.440
I have actual dogs barking on my show!

24:35.200 --> 24:36.480
And at 9:00 p.m. every night,

24:36.560 --> 24:39.520
when I'm trying to
make a really serious point

24:41.160 --> 24:42.160
on the show

24:42.520 --> 24:44.440
the bread and eggs delivery
guy will ring the doorbell.

24:45.960 --> 24:48.520
He's taken the "Hit the bell icon"
very seriously!

24:51.880 --> 24:54.360
The downside of being on the internet…

24:55.840 --> 24:56.760
trolls!

24:57.520 --> 24:59.360
On Twitter, doesn't matter what I say,

24:59.640 --> 25:02.600
even if I post those "Flower Good Morning"

25:02.680 --> 25:04.520
WhatsApp forwards that uncles share.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.520
Even if I post that,

25:06.680 --> 25:08.720
you scroll all the way
to the bottom of the comments,

25:08.800 --> 25:11.760
and there will be these couple
of guys who'll be like, "Hindu hater."

25:12.600 --> 25:14.520
Which is hilarious,
because my husband is Hindu.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.480
So really, I'm a Hindu lover…

25:22.680 --> 25:24.680
The other thing that
gets said very regularly is,

25:25.480 --> 25:27.760
"This is too political.
I am unfollowing."

25:28.640 --> 25:29.720
So, what do you expect?

25:30.120 --> 25:31.600
It's like going to Atul Khatri's profile

25:31.680 --> 25:34.360
and saying, "Too many sex jokes.
I am unfollowing."

25:37.480 --> 25:38.920
Look at the personality, man!

25:40.800 --> 25:44.960
It's not cool to be apolitical because
politics affects everything in your life.

25:46.200 --> 25:51.520
It affects what you eat,
what you watch and who you will marry.

25:52.640 --> 25:55.320
Right? So, to say that "I'm apolitical"…

25:55.960 --> 25:58.760
is like closing your eyes
when someone is slapping you

25:58.840 --> 26:00.360
and hoping it will not hurt.

26:02.040 --> 26:04.320
Now people will argue saying,
"Fake news!"

26:05.120 --> 26:07.720
True. Fake news is dangerous.

26:07.920 --> 26:09.800
Technically, if you can spend 30 minutes

26:09.880 --> 26:13.080
trying to figure out your
Zomato order every night,

26:13.400 --> 26:17.080
you should be able to give 30 minutes
to figure out reliable sources of news.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.480
And I'll give you a hack, right?
It's a good hack.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.280
Ask yourself,

26:23.200 --> 26:26.480
"Who's paying for this news
to be produced and sent to me?"

26:27.480 --> 26:28.320
You…

26:29.640 --> 26:30.760
or the advertiser?

26:32.120 --> 26:35.400
Because whoever is paying for it is
the real customer of that service, right?

26:35.560 --> 26:37.800
If you're not paying for it,
you are not the customer.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.040
You are the commodity.

26:39.680 --> 26:45.000
Your attention span is being
chopped up into nice little packages

26:45.080 --> 26:47.000
and sold to the customer.

26:47.480 --> 26:51.000
So, you have to remember
that the choice is yours.

26:51.360 --> 26:53.440
But even if this seems like too much work,

26:53.960 --> 26:56.240
there is one thing that
you can do which is base level,

26:56.320 --> 26:58.240
very easy, to stop fake news.

26:58.600 --> 26:59.920
Don't get your news from WhatsApp.

27:05.240 --> 27:08.680
So, every time you consume news,
you get to choose

27:09.360 --> 27:13.080
whether you want facts or whether
you want sensationalism and lies.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.840
You get to choose whether
you want journalism

27:16.080 --> 27:18.800
to remain the fourth
pillar of our democracy

27:19.120 --> 27:21.600
or to become a courier service for hate.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.440
The choice is yours.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.480
You are the boss.

27:24.760 --> 27:25.920
And that is the truth.

27:26.280 --> 27:27.240
Period.

27:27.680 --> 27:28.600
Thank you!

27:32.120 --> 27:35.200
Give it up for Faye D'souza, everyone!

27:38.680 --> 27:40.320
That was the scariest
thing I've ever done.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.240
Really?

27:41.320 --> 27:43.760
And I've been inside
the COVID ICU of KEM hospital!

27:45.280 --> 27:46.480
But would you do stand-up again?

27:48.240 --> 27:49.520
-Yes!
-No, but…

27:49.880 --> 27:52.040
-Yeah!
-Yes!

27:53.360 --> 27:55.240
People are tired of seeing Atul, man.
How much more?

27:56.680 --> 28:01.040
And with COVID at my age,
I don't know how long…

28:01.480 --> 28:03.320
Ladies and gents,
you've been a fabulous audience.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.960
Thank you so much for coming out,
and supporting live stand-up comedy!

28:06.120 --> 28:07.120
This is One Mic Stand.

28:07.200 --> 28:09.240
Can we hear it once
again for Faye D'souza?

28:10.640 --> 28:11.960
Give it up for Atul Khatri!

28:12.840 --> 28:13.960
I'm your host, Sapan Verma.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.440
Thank you so much! Good night!
Bye-bye, see you.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.560
-Dude, so much fun!
-It's done!

28:30.840 --> 28:32.280
-Seriously, that was damn good!
-I have…

28:32.400 --> 28:34.960
so much respect
for what you guys do now.

28:35.320 --> 28:36.400
-Because it's just--
-Before, you didn't, huh?

28:36.640 --> 28:38.200
No, you know, it's not that.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.120
It just feels like okay,
you're telling jokes.

28:40.200 --> 28:42.080
-Yeah. Yeah.
-So, how hard could it be?

28:42.160 --> 28:43.640
But it's so hard, man!

28:44.040 --> 28:47.560
Just like lining it up,
remembering all the details,

28:47.760 --> 28:49.840
keeping the energy. It's a lot!

28:49.920 --> 28:51.560
It's more than what it seems like.

28:51.640 --> 28:55.560
You know, everything you
said in the sessions we did before

28:55.720 --> 28:57.160
was making sense on stage.

28:57.240 --> 28:58.440
You know, I could hear Atul's voice.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.000
It's like, when you learn to drive,
you can hear your dad's voice

29:01.080 --> 29:03.040
every time you take a right turn.
Like that.

29:03.120 --> 29:05.720
I could hear Atul's voice, "Alright.
Do this. Then make eye contact."

29:06.840 --> 29:08.680
Awesome!
Thank you so much for doing this!

29:08.760 --> 29:10.440
-Thank you!
-Thank you, Atul! Thank you, Faye!

29:10.520 --> 29:11.360
This was so much fun!
