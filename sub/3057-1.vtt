New York. Columbia. Cornell. Yale.

01:02.258 --> 01:04.075
You won't lose me to a ball game.

01:04.175 --> 01:07.207
- I'm here and committed.
- Oh, please John,

01:07.341 --> 01:09.700
we're in no doubt you're our man
to captain this ship.

01:09.800 --> 01:11.582
Jack has told us all about you.

01:11.800 --> 01:14.874
Jack I... I told them you were
a boy scout after my job.

01:15.383 --> 01:17.491
Yale. Boston. Harvard. Mount Holyoke.

01:17.591 --> 01:19.374

01:26.133 --> 01:29.491
So, as incumbent of the Chair of Poetry,

01:29.591 --> 01:31.158
how are you finding our students?

01:31.258 --> 01:32.450
They have all the answers.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.832
Read all the books and listened intently

01:35.383 --> 01:38.783
but... sometimes it feels like
I'm teaching the same student.

01:38.883 --> 01:40.499
And that's a bad thing?

01:41.591 --> 01:43.749
New York. Columbia.

01:43.883 --> 01:45.665
Cornell. Yale.

01:46.966 --> 01:48.540
This man is a good writer.

01:49.591 --> 01:51.624
What he doesn't know about
the written word...

01:51.883 --> 01:53.665
Well, that's why I suggested him.

01:53.841 --> 01:55.874
Look at you now, John. You have tenure.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.749
It only took five years.

01:58.300 --> 02:00.866
New York. Columbia. Cornell. Yale.

02:00.966 --> 02:03.374
Boston. Harvard. Mount Holyoke.

02:03.675 --> 02:06.124
Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago.

02:06.425 --> 02:07.999
John and I met at Vassar.

02:08.633 --> 02:10.789
I was Chair of the Editorial Board.

02:11.050 --> 02:14.825
John ran a...
a kind of writers workshop.

02:14.925 --> 02:17.249
I proofed his first poem in Helicon.

02:18.800 --> 02:23.040
Boston. Harvard.
Mount Holyoke. Philadelphia.

02:24.841 --> 02:27.249
Iowa. Hobart. Florida.

02:29.300 --> 02:31.374
Pomona. Santa Barbara.

02:36.008 --> 02:37.749
San Francisco.

02:46.800 --> 02:50.415
Now, what of this visitor
you're proposing?

02:51.008 --> 02:53.116
Now, I understand it's a little cavalier

02:53.216 --> 02:55.374
to undertake a tour of
this scale in my first month

02:56.383 --> 02:58.374
but the idea isn't new to me.

02:58.550 --> 03:01.075
I've wanted to show him off
to America for an age.

03:01.655 --> 03:03.165
So you're a fan.

03:03.991 --> 03:07.658
I believe him to be the purest lyrical poet
in the English speaking world.

03:07.758 --> 03:10.415
We're all a fan of his work....

03:12.466 --> 03:13.700
But?

03:13.800 --> 03:17.957
Jack here tells me
your man has a reputation...

03:18.758 --> 03:21.374
for 'roaring behaviour'.

03:22.008 --> 03:24.575
Stories of pub-room escapades

03:24.675 --> 03:28.874
that brought wives,
mothers and the London police running.

03:29.383 --> 03:33.457
It is true that friends and colleagues
of my own in London talk of this...

03:35.300 --> 03:36.749
man-child.

03:37.050 --> 03:40.116
Terrorizing events
and functions with his mischief.

03:40.216 --> 03:41.582
Sounds fun.

03:42.091 --> 03:45.499
Not when your job is at stake.

03:48.800 --> 03:51.415
I think what the Dean
is trying to say is...

03:52.091 --> 03:53.575
How do you propose to handle him?

03:53.675 --> 03:54.999
I'll improvise.

03:55.883 --> 04:01.624
Flippancy is the most hopeless form
of intellectual vice, Mr. Brinnin.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.832
With all due respect, sir...

04:06.466 --> 04:08.249
I am not naive to this.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.783
Wasn't it Mark Twain who said,

04:11.883 --> 04:13.700
"A lie can travel halfway
around the world

04:13.800 --> 04:15.915
while the truth is still putting
on its shoes."

04:16.132 --> 04:18.075
Get to the point, Mr. Brinnin.

04:18.175 --> 04:20.075
It's just that the stories
we hear about him

04:20.175 --> 04:23.082
this side of the world must be inflated,

04:23.383 --> 04:25.457
otherwise how could they travel so far?

04:26.716 --> 04:30.540
Yes, I'm excited and yes, I'm a fan,

04:31.383 --> 04:34.040
but this is a great opportunity
for us all.

04:35.300 --> 04:37.040
How many venues are booked?

04:37.175 --> 04:38.450
Twenty-five so far.

04:38.550 --> 04:40.366
New York. Columbia, Cornell.

04:40.466 --> 04:43.783
Yale, Boston, Harvard, Philadelphia,
Washington, Chicago...

04:43.883 --> 04:46.575
- Okay, okay...
- And more on the west coast.

04:46.675 --> 04:48.540
We get it, Mr. Brinnin.

05:33.508 --> 05:34.790
Well?

05:36.383 --> 05:40.116
All hail, McBrinnin!
Thou shalt be king hereafter!

05:40.216 --> 05:42.950
- They said yes?
- Yeah, no thanks to you.

05:43.050 --> 05:44.616
"I'll improvise"? You son of a bitch.

05:44.716 --> 05:46.915
I thought Loomis was going to
have a heart attack.

05:47.133 --> 05:49.040
Congratulations, champ.

05:49.216 --> 05:52.457
This is your moment
in the sun, go for it.

05:52.591 --> 05:54.158
You know what the best part is?

05:54.258 --> 05:56.075
We get to work together after all.

05:56.175 --> 05:58.325
Together? What do you mean?

05:58.425 --> 06:01.408
Easy, Ahab, you still get
to reel in the big fish.

06:01.508 --> 06:03.950
I'll just be riding shotgun
once in a while.

06:04.050 --> 06:06.665
You know, a kind of
part time confederate.

06:07.716 --> 06:12.457
Lighten up. It was either that or have
the old man ride your ass like Sea-biscuit

06:14.341 --> 06:17.450
I'll calm any stormy weather
and keep the old man off your back.

06:17.550 --> 06:18.616
Stormy weather?

06:18.716 --> 06:22.200
You know what I'm talking about.
You make him sound like a monster.

06:22.300 --> 06:25.040
No smoke without fire,
that's all I'm saying...

06:25.675 --> 06:29.624
Just be careful,
and if I can dare to say,

06:30.591 --> 06:34.783
"Tread softly because
you tread on our dreams."

06:34.883 --> 06:36.033
Thank you.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.999
How much trouble can one poet be?

06:51.300 --> 06:53.325
John? What the fuck's that maniac doing?

07:05.800 --> 07:07.582
Get him off me.

07:12.050 --> 07:14.624
Now you know exactly
what you've brought to America.

07:16.091 --> 07:17.783
It would seem that
"the purest lyrical poet

07:17.883 --> 07:19.616
of the English speaking world"
is plastered.

07:19.716 --> 07:22.241
- What's he doing here?
- Come on, party's over.

07:22.341 --> 07:23.408
I was just warming up.

07:23.508 --> 07:25.366
No, I think you've had enough.

07:25.466 --> 07:27.124
Let me take you back to your hotel.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.450
Dylan, please.
I believe it's time to go...

07:30.550 --> 07:33.374
And I believe in naked women
in wet mackintoshes.

07:34.050 --> 07:37.040
I believe in the moon... the stars.

07:37.508 --> 07:39.665
I believe in Third Avenue...

07:40.383 --> 07:42.040
I don't believe in New York.

07:42.216 --> 07:45.540
Jesus Christ, John.
You invite this lunatic into my house...

07:46.133 --> 07:48.249
he broke my crock pot, John.

07:49.216 --> 07:52.832
My crock pot. It's a Double-Dipper.

07:53.008 --> 07:58.540
We can't have Harvey's crock
not working now, can we?

08:03.050 --> 08:04.415
Good night, John.

08:05.383 --> 08:08.575
Mr. Thomas, the pleasure was all ours.

08:18.716 --> 08:21.283
- You're mad at me.
- No, I'm not.

08:21.383 --> 08:23.290
Yes, you are, you're mad at me,

08:24.258 --> 08:26.165
and embarrassed for your friends.

08:28.550 --> 08:31.374
- I'm a shit.
- No, you're just drunk.

08:34.341 --> 08:35.914
Excuse me.

08:43.549 --> 08:45.249
I miss you.

09:02.716 --> 09:06.241
We... We need fresh towels.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.165
Are you okay? What's wrong?

09:18.133 --> 09:20.499
Just my 'froth corrupted lungs'

09:20.800 --> 09:22.457
It doesn't sound good.

09:22.633 --> 09:24.290
Death isn't meant to.

09:25.133 --> 09:26.790
Who was at the door?

09:28.175 --> 09:29.582
The manager.

09:30.550 --> 09:32.999
I didn't think this hotel
suited you anyway.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.582
I'm hungry for something John.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.783
Would you be a pal?
You are my pal, aren't you?

09:43.883 --> 09:46.165
Would you fetch me one
of those milkshakes?

09:46.466 --> 09:48.575
Oh, I... It's very late.

09:48.675 --> 09:52.540
A big fat yankee-doodling
milkshake and candy bars and

09:53.216 --> 09:57.665
chocolates and a comic of some sorts.

09:58.841 --> 10:00.082
Would you?

10:01.966 --> 10:03.624
Give me ten minutes.

10:04.425 --> 10:08.832
You can stay tonight and tomorrow
then we have to change hotel.

10:11.925 --> 10:13.540
It's very decent of them.

10:46.258 --> 10:47.790
Dylan, I'm back!

10:47.925 --> 10:49.616
I couldn't get you a milkshake but I...

10:49.716 --> 10:50.783
I got you some candy,

10:50.883 --> 10:52.575
I took the liberty of getting
you a 'Superman'.

10:52.675 --> 10:55.457
Dylan?

11:09.841 --> 11:11.540
Watch it!

11:37.466 --> 11:39.700
Don't be angry with me, John.
Don't be mean.

11:39.800 --> 11:40.991
I was lost without you.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.033
- I have never been so...
- Pleased to see me?

11:43.133 --> 11:45.408
So angry and upset, actually.

11:45.508 --> 11:47.033
Let me introduce you to Mickey.

11:47.133 --> 11:48.158
Screw you, fairy.

11:48.258 --> 11:49.741
Please, my fully developed friend.

11:49.841 --> 11:52.741
Be nice. We just arm wrestled for money.

11:52.841 --> 11:54.991
Oh? How did you do?

11:55.091 --> 11:56.533
I came second.

11:56.633 --> 11:58.825
So... you're buying then?

11:58.925 --> 12:00.575
My goodness. You're very strong.

12:00.675 --> 12:02.749
Two stouts for me and my new pal.

12:02.883 --> 12:04.582
That's the black stuff, isn't it?

12:06.466 --> 12:09.040
- Eggs?
- You are going to love it.

12:09.675 --> 12:11.249
But I don't need the...

12:11.675 --> 12:13.915
To all the lights that guided us.

12:14.383 --> 12:16.825
To all the women that guided our wrongs.

12:16.925 --> 12:18.241
To the lost...

12:18.341 --> 12:20.158
and the ones who still wait for them.

12:20.258 --> 12:22.283
Cheers!

12:22.383 --> 12:24.832
Drink, drink!

12:26.591 --> 12:28.415
- Drink, drink...
- Come on, John!

12:30.925 --> 12:33.957
I've always been strong. Like an ox!

12:34.258 --> 12:36.408
We're pit men with dirty nails.

12:36.508 --> 12:40.366
Chest thumping Neanderthals
with songs in our hearts.

12:40.466 --> 12:42.116
Oh, Christ, I've got to put you down.

12:44.466 --> 12:45.950
It would be at this time in the evening

12:46.050 --> 12:49.700
at Browns, my local,
Dai Jenkins would shout

12:49.800 --> 12:53.700
"Does anybody want a fight?"

12:56.300 --> 12:58.200
Hey, buddy, keep it down!

12:58.300 --> 13:01.616
Down, down?
I have enough trouble getting it up!

13:01.716 --> 13:03.200
What did you say buddy?

13:03.300 --> 13:04.908
Want me to come and break your head in?

13:05.008 --> 13:06.366
- Well that's rich.
- That what you want?

13:06.466 --> 13:07.533
Come and try it.

13:07.633 --> 13:09.559
But I warn you,
with me you're out of your depth!

13:09.659 --> 13:13.074
Isn't that right, John?

13:18.300 --> 13:20.165
Where does it all come from?

13:20.425 --> 13:22.832
The words.
From which spring do they pour?

13:23.133 --> 13:27.124
- Don't.
- No one is that mysterious.

13:27.675 --> 13:29.332
We're having fun, John.

13:30.383 --> 13:31.950
Don't take it away.

13:32.050 --> 13:34.124
- I'm not taking it away.
- Why do you have to ruin it?

13:34.966 --> 13:36.624
Label it?

13:38.758 --> 13:40.249
I'm sorry.

13:42.508 --> 13:44.165
No, I'm sorry.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.832
I'm a horrible little imp

13:48.675 --> 13:51.040
who can't hold his friends
or answer his liquor.

13:53.258 --> 13:54.707
Forgive me.

14:00.466 --> 14:02.374
How much money am I going to make?

14:02.716 --> 14:04.707
Enough, I'm sure.

14:05.258 --> 14:07.082
I can go over the books in the morning.

14:09.091 --> 14:10.665
Can I get you to a doctor?

14:45.633 --> 14:46.999
Hello.

14:47.383 --> 14:49.749
That was quite a scene
at Harvey's last night.

14:50.258 --> 14:51.741
Can't say I was surprised.

14:51.841 --> 14:54.741
He was drunk, Jack. Over excited.

14:55.609 --> 14:57.249
I dare say he was.

14:57.841 --> 14:59.408
We should cancel tonight's reading.

14:59.508 --> 15:01.499
No, Jack. Please!

15:01.841 --> 15:04.040
There's nothing to say he can't perform.

15:04.341 --> 15:06.332
I didn't bring him here
to go to parties.

15:06.883 --> 15:10.582
No. No, we didn't, did we?

15:11.175 --> 15:13.457
I hope you've got the stomach
for this, John.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.207
I'll see you later.

15:16.675 --> 15:18.165
Thank you, Jack.

15:30.425 --> 15:34.158
Oh, Dylan, the last time I saw you,

15:34.258 --> 15:36.707
you were an angel.

15:37.550 --> 15:40.207
Now look at you.

15:40.841 --> 15:43.124
There you go.

15:43.675 --> 15:48.915
Such tragedy, such loss.

15:49.258 --> 15:53.874
The things I could do
with you... for you.

15:54.008 --> 15:55.874
Hopeless boy.

15:59.883 --> 16:04.874
Be brilliant, boy. Try and be brilliant.

16:07.383 --> 16:10.582
This is your final call. Five minutes.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.707
Look after him.

16:15.333 --> 16:17.491
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

16:17.591 --> 16:19.874
Tonight's performance
will begin shortly.

16:21.175 --> 16:22.665
Bye.

16:30.341 --> 16:31.700
Are you going to make me do this?

16:31.800 --> 16:34.290
- Everything okay, gentlemen?
- Of course.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.290
Your audience awaits you, Mr. Thomas.

17:17.425 --> 17:20.457
"If I were tickled by the rub of love

17:21.050 --> 17:24.874
A rooking girl who stole me for her side

17:25.340 --> 17:29.790
Broke through her straws
breaking my bandaged string

17:29.925 --> 17:32.450
If the red tickle as the cattle calve

17:32.550 --> 17:36.290
still set to scratch
a laughter from my lung

17:36.716 --> 17:40.374
I would not fear the apple nor the flood

17:40.550 --> 17:43.665
Nor the bad blood of spring

17:44.925 --> 17:48.957
Shall it be male or female?
Say the cells

17:49.300 --> 17:53.082
And drop the plum
like fire from the flesh"

18:19.258 --> 18:22.491
Rest is obviously needed along
with a complete change of lifestyle,

18:22.591 --> 18:24.950
starting from now,
if he's to have a fighting chance.

18:25.050 --> 18:26.450
I'm a drunk!

18:26.550 --> 18:28.290
- He knows.
- I know.

18:28.508 --> 18:29.825
Have you contacted his family?

18:29.925 --> 18:31.707
Leave her out of this!

18:32.133 --> 18:33.533
You have to.

18:33.633 --> 18:35.991
This isn't something you and I can fix.
Believe me.

18:36.091 --> 18:39.040
I sent a letter on his arrival
but nothing since.

18:39.716 --> 18:42.207
- Perhaps I should call.
- Yes, you should.

18:43.633 --> 18:46.957
Doctor, we've major engagements
that start in a few days.

18:47.341 --> 18:48.874
Important engagements.

18:49.800 --> 18:50.991
Important?

18:51.091 --> 18:53.874
I can't stop him, I can only advise.

18:54.008 --> 18:55.915
But for now and until then

18:56.050 --> 18:58.082
don't let him out of your sight.

19:00.300 --> 19:02.124
New York is killing him.

19:04.800 --> 19:06.790
It was a pleasure, Mr Thomas.

19:07.258 --> 19:09.540
I'm a great admirer of your work.

19:11.508 --> 19:12.874
Good night.

19:34.925 --> 19:36.999
Dylan, are you okay?

19:37.716 --> 19:40.575
Please come out, we need to talk.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.874
Thought I'd find you here.

19:48.008 --> 19:51.457
I took the liberty of collecting
your mail from your office.

19:51.633 --> 19:55.124
I think that one's for Dylan.
It's from... Caitlin Thomas.

19:55.716 --> 19:58.116
Congratulations, on this evening.

19:58.216 --> 20:01.207
It certainly was a triumph.
Tickets have started to fly out.

20:02.091 --> 20:03.200
Where's Dylan?

20:03.300 --> 20:06.124
He's in the bathroom.
He's a little under the weather.

20:07.075 --> 20:08.582
You boys.

20:09.925 --> 20:12.783
Look, I understand your next reading
isn't for four days?

20:12.883 --> 20:14.200
I'd have no bother setting up another

20:14.300 --> 20:15.783
- venue before...
- No, no thank you.

20:15.883 --> 20:20.082
It would be good to take the time
to prepare and work up to it.

20:21.091 --> 20:22.533
Fair enough.

20:22.633 --> 20:24.790
We wouldn't want to kill
the man now, would we?

20:29.675 --> 20:31.915
- I'll see you in four days.
- Sorry?

20:32.550 --> 20:35.540
At Yale, John. Yale.

20:36.091 --> 20:37.874
My old Alma Mater.

20:38.091 --> 20:39.741
I promised them a private reading.

20:39.841 --> 20:41.040
Right.

20:41.633 --> 20:43.874
I really don't want to mess that one up.

20:45.008 --> 20:46.749
Again, well done.

20:46.925 --> 20:48.749
You really have caught the big fish.

21:05.300 --> 21:06.915
Something for me?

21:08.716 --> 21:10.082
From home.

21:13.341 --> 21:14.832
Your wife.

21:22.675 --> 21:24.415
Lavender scent.

21:26.425 --> 21:28.374
It's how she gets a grip on you.

21:28.675 --> 21:30.207
Will you not open it?

21:34.591 --> 21:37.707
Yale is in a few days.
It's very important...

21:39.383 --> 21:41.457
New York City...

21:43.966 --> 21:45.915
you brave bitch.

21:48.550 --> 21:50.665
You certainly haven't disappointed.

21:53.841 --> 21:55.874
Dylan... Dylan?

21:56.550 --> 21:58.874
Christ! Don't do this to me, Dylan.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.665
Don't you bloody dare...

22:06.925 --> 22:08.457
Please, John.

22:10.383 --> 22:13.499
- Reception. Hello?
- Please...

22:13.883 --> 22:15.082
Hello?

24:37.050 --> 24:39.832
Jesus, John! What have you done?

24:43.008 --> 24:44.999
What happened to Third Avenue?

24:46.300 --> 24:48.366
Did the Reds steal it in the night?

24:48.466 --> 24:51.408
Morning. We're in Fairfield County.

24:51.508 --> 24:53.374
Forty-seven miles up the coast.

24:53.883 --> 24:55.707
This belonged to my parents.

24:56.466 --> 24:58.116
We used to summer here.

24:58.216 --> 25:00.366
These days I don't really
make it up here.

25:05.383 --> 25:08.665
Now it's a halfway house
for a dollar-mad nightingale.

25:09.050 --> 25:10.950
We only have three days until Yale.

25:11.050 --> 25:12.832
I need to make sure you're ready.

25:13.216 --> 25:15.707
You make me sound like a prize bull.

25:16.841 --> 25:19.832
New York wasn't... compatible.

25:22.216 --> 25:24.540
- With what?
- With you.

25:27.300 --> 25:28.624
I see...

25:30.050 --> 25:31.499
Do I get a say in all this?

25:31.800 --> 25:33.540
You heard what the doctor said.

25:36.716 --> 25:38.040
Yes.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.290
He liked my work.

25:40.800 --> 25:45.457
You know, flippancy is the most hopeless
form of intellectual vice.

25:45.591 --> 25:47.999
Well, if that's a vice,

25:48.716 --> 25:50.624
to hell with virtue.

25:53.716 --> 25:55.075
What's for breakfast?

25:55.175 --> 25:56.749
There's a store in town.

25:56.966 --> 25:58.624
I'll get groceries.

25:59.508 --> 26:00.991
Candy bars...

26:01.091 --> 26:04.332
Tootsie Rolls, Baby Ruths,

26:05.550 --> 26:07.499
Milky Ways...

26:14.008 --> 26:16.415
We could be in 'Moiphy's' right now,

26:16.675 --> 26:19.749
sharing a glass and a song
with international spies

26:19.883 --> 26:22.241
and girls with names like candy bars.

26:22.341 --> 26:24.950
And I'd be peeling you
off the floor and carrying you home.

26:25.050 --> 26:27.874
As I seem to recall,
it was me who carried you.

26:30.508 --> 26:33.749
If you're looking for whiskey,
there isn't any. Or beer.

26:34.008 --> 26:37.332
Well you must at least have a couple
of showgirls stashed away somewhere.

26:37.758 --> 26:39.033
Come out, lovelies!

26:39.133 --> 26:42.366
Show us your milkshakes and I'll
sing you a verse of 'Sosban Fach'.

26:42.466 --> 26:43.616
Dylan, sit down.

26:43.716 --> 26:45.283
We need to go over your itinerary.

26:45.383 --> 26:47.408
I've some ideas
for changing the recitals

26:47.508 --> 26:49.741
to include works of other poets
like you suggested.

26:49.841 --> 26:51.832
I can't do this. I need distraction.

26:53.300 --> 26:54.825
You brought me here
and I'm looking to you

26:54.925 --> 26:58.207
as a master of ceremonies.
Keep me entertained.

26:59.383 --> 27:02.707
Can't this wait? Please.

27:03.966 --> 27:06.866
I should warn you,
I was taught by my father

27:06.966 --> 27:10.790
who was East Coast Amateur
Champion five years running.

27:12.966 --> 27:14.332
Ta-da.

27:18.008 --> 27:20.200
You know something,
if this is so awful for you

27:20.300 --> 27:21.957
and you're looking for distraction...

27:23.133 --> 27:24.832
Why don't you open this?

27:28.716 --> 27:30.082
What do I do?

27:32.466 --> 27:34.165
You can't play chess?

27:35.466 --> 27:37.915
- Why didn't you say?
- You never asked.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.374
Okay, okay.

27:41.966 --> 27:43.533
These guys upfront are your pawns.

27:43.633 --> 27:44.908
Think of them as your linemen.

27:45.008 --> 27:48.033
The other pieces behind are like
your quarterbacks and linebackers...

27:48.133 --> 27:50.165
Talk rugby, boy.
This is all Greek to me.

27:51.008 --> 27:52.957
- What does this horse do?
- It's a knight.

27:53.133 --> 27:54.200
It looks like a horse.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.158
Yes, I know, but it's called a knight.

27:56.258 --> 27:58.165
When is a horse not a horse?

27:58.300 --> 28:00.082
When it turns into a barn.

28:00.841 --> 28:02.874
My eldest, Llewelyn, told me that.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.624
He laughs every time.

28:07.841 --> 28:09.366
It moves like this, in an L-shape.

28:09.466 --> 28:11.040
What's your story, boyo?

28:12.300 --> 28:14.707
You look like a spare prick
at a wedding.

28:15.508 --> 28:17.249
I lost the real chess piece.

28:17.383 --> 28:19.866
This little guy was a freebie
in a box of Raisin Bran.

28:19.966 --> 28:21.533
He's been here ever since.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.249
Fighting for king and queen.

28:25.008 --> 28:26.499
And that's the king.

28:27.091 --> 28:28.707
He must have some clout?

28:28.841 --> 28:30.116
Not as much as the queen.

28:30.216 --> 28:31.866
The most powerful piece on the board.

28:31.966 --> 28:34.991
She has the goods to capture
every opposing piece in play.

28:35.091 --> 28:37.165
The female of the species.

28:39.966 --> 28:41.582
You've never met my wife.

28:43.550 --> 28:45.241
You know, you really should
open that letter.

28:45.341 --> 28:47.290
You should mind your own business.

28:50.758 --> 28:55.283
The object of the game is to checkmate
your opponent's King.

28:55.383 --> 28:59.075
That is, place him in an untenable position
from which he can't escape.

28:59.175 --> 29:00.874
I know the feeling.

29:03.466 --> 29:04.866
So...

29:04.966 --> 29:08.325
I can explain the finer details
as we go along.

29:08.425 --> 29:11.200
But those are
the basic principles of the game...

29:11.300 --> 29:12.915
Does that all seem clear to you?

29:13.966 --> 29:15.415
Crystal.

29:15.716 --> 29:16.825
No questions?

29:16.925 --> 29:18.158
- Just one.
- Shoot.

29:18.258 --> 29:20.415
Where can I get a hot pastrami sandwich?

29:33.550 --> 29:34.999
Paradise.

29:36.050 --> 29:37.624
That's one word for it.

29:38.008 --> 29:40.033
Two Chicks on a Raft, wreck 'em!

29:40.133 --> 29:42.741
Shingle with a shimmy
and a shake in the alley.

29:42.841 --> 29:45.991
Zeppelins in a Fog, City juice,
eighty-six the hail.

29:46.091 --> 29:49.207
Drag one through Georgia,
and a First Lady!

29:50.591 --> 29:52.533
Hello. How are you?

29:52.633 --> 29:54.950
- I'm a friend of John's.
- John who?

29:55.050 --> 29:56.749
John Malcolm Brinnin.

29:57.716 --> 29:59.082
Him.

30:00.008 --> 30:01.665
Do you want feeding?

30:01.841 --> 30:03.415
- A hot pastrami...
- No, thank you.

30:03.550 --> 30:05.290
Ice cream, please.

30:05.425 --> 30:08.124
- Two cherry cokes.
- And a Bourbon on the side.

30:08.258 --> 30:11.033
Shoot twice from the South,
Drag 'em Wild and a Houseboat.

30:11.133 --> 30:12.283
A shot of red eye.

30:12.383 --> 30:14.665
We'll be playing this.
What is this marvel?

30:15.133 --> 30:16.540
Pinball?

30:17.883 --> 30:19.582
Pinball.

30:21.633 --> 30:23.249
Do you like me?

30:23.925 --> 30:25.749
Am I irresistible?

30:25.966 --> 30:27.957
I must warn you,
I might break your heart.

30:28.966 --> 30:31.165
Strange little foreign man.

30:32.925 --> 30:34.825
With one stroke of her paw,
she was gone.

30:34.925 --> 30:36.415
Don't mention it.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.491
Jesus, is that you?

30:46.591 --> 30:48.450
I've already outlived Jesus.

30:48.550 --> 30:50.533
Why do you keep it? You look so...

30:50.633 --> 30:52.783
Smaller. Half the size.

30:52.883 --> 30:54.325
Yes... and prettier.

30:54.425 --> 30:55.616
Yeah, prettier.

30:55.716 --> 30:58.325
- It's a real shame.
- Incredible.

30:58.425 --> 30:59.950
- What happened?
- Is every woman

31:00.050 --> 31:01.908
in this pigsty of a town out to get me?

31:02.008 --> 31:05.116
Hey, we were just saying, mister.

31:05.216 --> 31:07.165
Yes, we were only saying.

31:08.341 --> 31:09.915
John?

31:11.425 --> 31:13.075
Hello, Jack?

31:13.175 --> 31:14.241
John?

31:14.341 --> 31:15.825
Christ, buddy,
where the hell have you been?

31:15.925 --> 31:17.950
I've been looking
all over Manhattan for you.

31:18.050 --> 31:19.991
The Beekman Tower
said you'd checked out.

31:20.091 --> 31:22.200
Yeah. We were asked to leave.

31:22.300 --> 31:23.749
Why was that?

31:24.716 --> 31:27.700
There was a... misunderstanding.

31:27.800 --> 31:30.707
You know how partisan
these Midtown hotels can be.

31:31.050 --> 31:32.783
Something got lost in translation.

31:32.883 --> 31:35.040
Between England and America.

31:35.341 --> 31:36.741
Who said it was Dylan?

31:36.841 --> 31:38.866
And he's not from England. Actually.

31:38.966 --> 31:41.325
Come on, John. Come on. We had a deal.

31:41.425 --> 31:43.874
You keep me in the loop
and I clean out your closet.

31:44.300 --> 31:45.999
It doesn't need cleaning.

31:46.383 --> 31:49.082
That's not what the
Beekman Tower concierge told me.

31:49.758 --> 31:53.040
I understand the management asked you
to find quarters elsewhere.

31:53.300 --> 31:55.499
- Which I have.
- Where?

31:56.716 --> 31:59.457
Look, you know
how sensitive this is, Jack.

31:59.758 --> 32:01.241
Tell me about it.

32:01.341 --> 32:03.533
I've got Loomis
and the faculty asking questions.

32:03.633 --> 32:06.491
You think that stunt Thomas pulled
at Harvey's party went unnoticed?

32:06.591 --> 32:08.624
I'm trying to protect you, John.

32:08.883 --> 32:10.540
I'm on top of this.

32:12.591 --> 32:14.241
Sure doesn't sound that way.

32:14.341 --> 32:15.950
Just give me some more time.

32:16.050 --> 32:19.082
Yale is three days away.
I'm not an alchemist.

32:19.800 --> 32:21.158
I can do this, Jack.

32:21.258 --> 32:22.991
I can get him ready for America.

32:23.091 --> 32:24.540
You listen.

32:24.883 --> 32:26.499
Carefully.

32:27.300 --> 32:31.165
There is a line in the sand
and you haven't stepped over it yet.

32:31.675 --> 32:33.499
But I'll ask you again.

32:34.508 --> 32:36.400
Where are you?

32:36.800 --> 32:38.700
Please deposit ten cents for the next

32:38.800 --> 32:40.449
- for minutes.
- John.

32:41.175 --> 32:42.582
John?

32:43.508 --> 32:45.165
John, are you there?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.665
Answer me...

32:51.508 --> 32:52.957
John!

32:54.383 --> 32:55.874
John!

32:59.133 --> 33:01.991
At last. A couple of sarsaparillas
for the ladies.

33:02.091 --> 33:05.366
And two shots of red eye for me
and my luckless comrade here.

33:05.466 --> 33:07.832
Two Fifty-Fives and a red eye. Twice.

33:08.050 --> 33:09.624
Give it wings.

33:16.008 --> 33:17.707
The name's Rosie.

33:18.633 --> 33:21.999
Oh, right, yes. Well hello, Rosie.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.749
Whatever. What's your story?

33:26.425 --> 33:27.533
If you have one.

33:27.633 --> 33:31.124
I'm a poet... poetry professor.
Manhattan.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.200
This is my friend's
first trip to America.

33:33.300 --> 33:37.415
I'm his Boswell. His amanuensis.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.999
You must be a poet. You talk funny.

33:42.008 --> 33:44.499
So who's your friend?

33:44.800 --> 33:47.582
Dylan? Now he really is a poet.

33:48.050 --> 33:50.415
A famous one too. From Wales.

33:50.758 --> 33:52.665
Huh? Like Moby Dick?

33:53.133 --> 33:54.582
Not exactly.

33:54.883 --> 33:58.540
He is touring America reciting
his work and the work of others.

33:59.091 --> 34:01.332
Poetry, hey.

34:02.633 --> 34:06.707
Aren't you both... men?

34:07.341 --> 34:09.665
Yes, isn't that funny.

34:10.300 --> 34:12.165
I get off in an hour.

34:12.300 --> 34:14.831
Oh, we'll be long gone by then.

34:15.675 --> 34:18.498
Okay, Mr. Poetry. Make sure you pay.

34:19.007 --> 34:20.915
Settle up before you go.

34:22.675 --> 34:24.373
You wake early...

34:25.050 --> 34:27.824
and you go out to work and you
get home and you go back out

34:27.925 --> 34:30.248
again because you need
something for you.

34:31.425 --> 34:33.248
And you repeat that...

34:34.257 --> 34:38.831
You repeat that until something grabs
your attention and forces you to listen.

34:43.882 --> 34:45.415
"I'm leaving."

34:47.257 --> 34:49.040
And then you stop.

34:50.091 --> 34:53.873
Everything loses it's worth.
It's meaning.

34:55.882 --> 35:00.124
So you find a stool, and a glass...

35:01.258 --> 35:03.082
sometimes an ear.

35:03.508 --> 35:05.874
- You're welcome.
- And...

35:07.466 --> 35:09.624
and you wait, I guess,

35:10.508 --> 35:12.207
for the next surprise.

35:15.425 --> 35:17.950
"The beauty of the world
and the paragon of animals, yet to me,

35:18.050 --> 35:20.707
what is this quintessence of dust?"

35:20.925 --> 35:23.957
"Man delights not me,
nor women neither."

35:57.133 --> 35:59.332
I have to get this done I'm afraid.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.540
It wouldn't be fair on the students
if I kept them waiting.

36:04.675 --> 36:06.457
Did they ask you to do that?

36:06.800 --> 36:09.374
Ha. They expect me to.

36:09.675 --> 36:11.999
I'm head of poetry and creative writing.

36:21.341 --> 36:24.790
"You tried to break my father
and I walked on.

36:28.508 --> 36:32.499
My dreams became the collateral
of another boys dawn.

36:33.508 --> 36:37.332
To a chorus of hopeless liars
I still walked on

36:38.425 --> 36:42.415
Amongst the damned and the hungry,
Who share the same song."

36:45.091 --> 36:47.915
If only they knew
their work was being read by you.

36:49.008 --> 36:50.624
It's very moving.

36:53.091 --> 36:54.665
Brave boy.

36:56.841 --> 36:59.707
You don't just cough up
parents and dreams,

36:59.966 --> 37:02.124
hope and shame easily.

37:06.216 --> 37:08.540
And you certainly
don't scribble all over it.

37:08.925 --> 37:10.582
I'm his teacher,

37:11.883 --> 37:15.457
but please tell me something
that I could pass on to him.

37:16.258 --> 37:17.957
That would mean a great deal.

37:27.550 --> 37:29.457
You think I'm such a big deal.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.374
There's no rhythm to it,
just an idea that's unexplored.

37:44.300 --> 37:46.908
The first half belongs to
Robert Frost and the rest...

37:47.008 --> 37:48.457
me, probably.

37:49.675 --> 37:52.582
He's bullied by his own question
and rhyme,

37:54.175 --> 37:56.999
but all this is easily solved
by confidence.

37:58.925 --> 38:01.415
So if you want me to be helpful,

38:01.633 --> 38:05.499
truly of use to this young mind,

38:07.550 --> 38:10.499
then tell him Dylan Thomas
thinks he's great.

38:28.925 --> 38:30.665
Don't do this to me, John.

38:32.758 --> 38:34.790
I'm not ready for her. Not yet.

38:35.216 --> 38:36.325
What if she needs you

38:36.425 --> 38:38.415
- or the children...
- They always need me.

38:40.966 --> 38:42.832
That's why I'm here!

38:43.341 --> 38:45.749
I've overstepped the mark. I'm sorry.

38:45.925 --> 38:48.832
I really haven't slept. Sorry.

38:50.591 --> 38:52.665
It would mean the end of us, John.

39:08.591 --> 39:10.832
- Dylan, where are you going?
- Walk.

39:11.133 --> 39:12.582
Coming?

39:25.133 --> 39:26.950
It's good that we're doing this.

39:27.050 --> 39:28.700
Clear our heads before the next charge.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.241
It's beautiful.

39:30.341 --> 39:32.408
I've a few ideas about the Yale reading.

39:32.508 --> 39:34.283
Apparently the Provost
is quite a stickler for...

39:34.383 --> 39:36.741
- Wish I knew more.
- Sorry?

39:36.841 --> 39:38.075
The names of things...

39:38.175 --> 39:40.749
plants, animals, clouds,

39:41.050 --> 39:43.866
but the answers aren't there.
They were never put there.

39:43.966 --> 39:47.290
I can't describe the jealousy
that bubbles up inside me when

39:47.425 --> 39:50.040
people offer their knowledge on tap,
without asking.

39:50.175 --> 39:53.332
- Is that a warning?
- Don't be so sensitive.

39:54.466 --> 39:55.741
You're scared of your talent.

39:55.841 --> 39:57.957
Oh yes. Terrified.

39:58.883 --> 40:00.165
I knew it.

40:00.466 --> 40:03.366
All your behaviour is just deflection.

40:03.466 --> 40:06.408
From having to admit it's real
and precious and fragile.

40:06.508 --> 40:10.033
No person could be so connected
to the earth and human spirit by chance.

40:10.133 --> 40:12.241
It needs craft
and you protect that craft

40:12.341 --> 40:14.366
by investing in the trivial
within strangers.

40:14.466 --> 40:15.790
Am I right?

40:16.591 --> 40:18.207
Dylan, what are you doing?

40:19.008 --> 40:20.999
This is a pure way to travel.

40:22.633 --> 40:24.249
That's not your boat.

40:25.508 --> 40:27.582
- Are you getting in?
- No.

40:28.050 --> 40:30.790
- Suit yourself.
- Dylan... no.

40:31.383 --> 40:32.749
Dylan.

40:40.966 --> 40:43.533
Jesus, Dylan. These are wool pants.

40:43.633 --> 40:45.665
You'll have to keep your arms straight

40:46.050 --> 40:48.124
and let the weight
of the oars do the work.

40:49.175 --> 40:51.832
- You're very deft at this.
- Why wouldn't I be?

41:35.050 --> 41:37.290
Sometimes I don't understand you,

41:38.258 --> 41:40.832
and that's hard for me to admit.

41:43.050 --> 41:48.616
You lose me in a haze of language
and imagery that often

41:48.716 --> 41:50.499
- don't belong togeth...
- Kiss me.

41:51.466 --> 41:53.624
- No.
- Take me to bed.

41:54.425 --> 41:57.832
- Absolutely not.
- Then punch me in the nose.

41:58.050 --> 42:00.957
Bloody my mind with your rage
and forgive me nothing.

42:01.216 --> 42:04.999
Hold me tenderly as your friend
and keep my secrets.

42:06.508 --> 42:09.207
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

42:10.300 --> 42:12.249
It's about feeling something

42:12.508 --> 42:16.165
and allowing ourselves to feel it first,
before we tear it apart for answers.

42:17.300 --> 42:19.832
Clarity and understanding are last.

42:22.050 --> 42:24.290
So you write for yourself?

42:25.383 --> 42:26.999
For everyone.

42:28.383 --> 42:29.915
That's a big ask.

42:32.675 --> 42:34.374
Nobody asked.

42:39.050 --> 42:41.290
"Not for the proud man apart

42:41.716 --> 42:45.040
From the raging moon
I write on these spindrift pages

42:46.091 --> 42:49.207
Nor for the towering dead

42:49.550 --> 42:51.749
With their nightingales and psalms

42:53.091 --> 42:57.874
But for the lovers,
their arms Round the griefs of the ages

42:58.508 --> 43:03.415
Who pay no praise or wages,
Nor heed my craft or art"

43:08.050 --> 43:12.582
Exactly.

43:17.633 --> 43:19.915
Stop it, you mad man!

43:21.925 --> 43:23.999
- John!
- John!

43:24.133 --> 43:27.491
John, over here! Hello!

43:27.591 --> 43:29.158
- Who are they?
- Hello!

43:29.258 --> 43:30.366
I think it's the Hymans.

43:30.466 --> 43:31.616
- Over here.
- Hello!

43:31.716 --> 43:34.200
Oh, yes. It's definitely the Hymans.

43:34.300 --> 43:37.207
- Hello!
- She looks a hoot.

43:38.175 --> 43:39.491
- Hello!
- Hello!

43:39.591 --> 43:42.116
I'm Dylan Thomas,
I'm a friend of John's!

43:42.216 --> 43:44.665
We know. Hello to you!

43:45.300 --> 43:46.366
Come to dinner tonight?

43:46.466 --> 43:48.450
No, no... wait! We've not got the time.

43:48.550 --> 43:51.033
- It's our last day before Yale.
- Please?

43:51.133 --> 43:52.450
We'd love to!

43:52.550 --> 43:53.915
- Eight o'clock?
- Sure.

43:54.175 --> 43:57.075
Perfect! Perfect!

43:57.175 --> 43:58.665
Ciao!

43:59.216 --> 44:00.999
- Goodbye!
- Goodbye!

44:01.466 --> 44:02.790
Wave, John.

44:05.341 --> 44:06.533
Looking forward to you!

44:06.633 --> 44:09.249
Oh, thank you, thank you.

44:15.675 --> 44:17.408
- Hello, John.
- Hey, buddy.

44:17.508 --> 44:19.707
- I got it. I got it.
- Sorry, we are late.

44:23.883 --> 44:25.575
- What's this for?
- You kidding me?

44:25.675 --> 44:27.116
It's the Marciano-La Starza fight.

44:27.216 --> 44:30.624
I'm not missing that barn-burner.
Not even for Dylan Thomas.

44:35.716 --> 44:37.082
Shirley.

44:38.175 --> 44:40.332
This is my husband, Stanley.

44:41.175 --> 44:42.624
Enchanté.

44:43.800 --> 44:45.741
Shirley and Stanley are both writers.

44:45.841 --> 44:47.158
Stanley wrote, The Armed Vision:

44:47.258 --> 44:49.158
- A Study in the Methods of...
- John, John...

44:49.258 --> 44:52.450
Let's just say our main export
is books and children.

44:52.550 --> 44:54.700
We produce both in abundance.

44:54.800 --> 44:56.999
Can I please get a drink, John?
Thank you.

45:06.216 --> 45:08.033
- Higher.
- Lower.

45:08.133 --> 45:09.540
Hold it.

45:32.091 --> 45:33.283
Look at us.

45:33.383 --> 45:35.790
Like two spinster aunts at a prom ball.

45:36.091 --> 45:37.874
Why should they have all the fun?

45:38.716 --> 45:40.457
You call this fun?

45:41.466 --> 45:43.874
Shirley likes to cut loose
once in a while.

45:44.050 --> 45:46.616
Like Mount Vesuvius. I indulge.

45:46.716 --> 45:48.582
How very catholic of you.

45:48.841 --> 45:51.582
Not really. We all have our vices.

45:52.008 --> 45:53.457
Don't you?

45:55.300 --> 45:59.040
I don't have time for vices.
Dylan makes sure of that.

45:59.508 --> 46:01.491
Up until four days ago, I thought I was

46:01.591 --> 46:05.249
a Professor of Poetry in New York. Now?

46:06.925 --> 46:08.624
I'm not so sure.

46:09.008 --> 46:12.158
Benefactor, babysitter, nursemaid....

46:12.258 --> 46:14.999
Jesus, you make it sound
like a marriage.

46:16.008 --> 46:17.790
Like you and Shirley, huh?

46:18.050 --> 46:19.616
Oh I wouldn't go that far.

46:19.716 --> 46:21.915
There is a crucial difference, my boy.

46:22.050 --> 46:23.290
Oh?

46:24.341 --> 46:25.999
Shirley needs me.

46:29.633 --> 46:31.707
Come on, Boyo Rees.

46:32.300 --> 46:33.908
- Your turn.
- No, no...

46:34.008 --> 46:35.499
No, Dylan!

46:36.633 --> 46:38.991
Come on!

46:39.091 --> 46:41.408
America versus Wales. Put 'em up.

46:41.508 --> 46:42.700
- Come on.
- Put 'em up.

46:42.800 --> 46:45.075
Put your hands up, John. That's right.

46:45.175 --> 46:46.950
Whoa!

46:47.050 --> 46:50.249
Come on, try a bit harder. Put 'em up.

46:51.133 --> 46:53.457
- John, try harder.
- You first.

46:53.716 --> 46:55.082
Come on!

46:56.800 --> 47:02.040
Jesus, John. What the fuck?
Are you crazy?

47:02.758 --> 47:04.325
See what you did.

47:04.425 --> 47:06.116
You can't make friends with that.

47:06.216 --> 47:08.575
- I'm sorry. I didn't mean...
- Everyone stabilise.

47:08.675 --> 47:11.540
Let's not get our
pantyhose knotted, gentlemen.

47:12.925 --> 47:14.283
You okay, champ?

47:14.383 --> 47:17.249
Sucker punch. He's bleeding.

47:17.508 --> 47:19.241
It was an accident, Stan.

47:19.341 --> 47:21.908
Blood seems to be
my main export these days.

47:22.008 --> 47:23.533
I must have some alcohol out back...

47:23.633 --> 47:24.908
Sit down, Rocky.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.749
No one goes anywhere.
It's still cocktail hour.

47:27.883 --> 47:29.783
Well, I hope you've got
a Chinese jump rope

47:29.883 --> 47:32.325
or a stack of cards. Otherwise Stanley

47:32.425 --> 47:34.200
will start talking jazz.

47:34.300 --> 47:37.866
- A man needs a hobby, dear.
- Like a cat needs a bicycle.

47:37.966 --> 47:39.158
I've got a chess set that...

47:39.258 --> 47:41.790
John tells me
that you write horror stories.

47:44.883 --> 47:49.950
A young boy, let's call him Jimmy,
is sitting in school one spring afternoon.

47:50.050 --> 47:52.165
He's not really paying attention
to the class.

47:52.425 --> 47:55.040
Hell, it's double math.
Algebra. Trigonometry.

47:55.258 --> 47:56.950
You can't make friends with that.

47:57.050 --> 47:58.533
Shut up, Stan.

47:58.633 --> 48:00.783
Like a lot of kids his age,
Jimmy is daydreaming.

48:00.883 --> 48:04.491
He's thinking of the World Series,
and sophomore girls in bobby socks

48:04.591 --> 48:07.415
who look like Deanna Durbin.

48:08.216 --> 48:10.158
With these sweet distractions
in his head

48:10.258 --> 48:12.832
he absentmindedly looks out the window.

48:13.091 --> 48:16.950
He notices what appears to be a picture
laying on the ground in the schoolyard.

48:17.050 --> 48:18.200
He can't stop looking at it.

48:18.300 --> 48:22.124
So much so, that after class
he goes and picks it up.

48:24.675 --> 48:28.616
It is a photograph of a pretty
young girl in stovepipe pants,

48:28.716 --> 48:33.040
all peppercorn freckles
and a smile as big as Texas.

48:33.300 --> 48:36.582
She is holding up two fingers.
Like this...

48:39.800 --> 48:43.283
She is the most beautiful girl Jimmy
has ever seen.

48:43.383 --> 48:44.533
He is captivated.

48:44.633 --> 48:46.575
He spends the entire evening
asking around town

48:46.675 --> 48:48.832
if anybody knows her
or where he can find her.

48:49.008 --> 48:52.033
But no one knows.
Jimmy returns home disappointed.

48:52.133 --> 48:53.408
He lies in bed that night

48:53.508 --> 48:58.124
staring at the picture of the girl
until he falls asleep.

49:01.258 --> 49:04.082
Later that night he is suddenly awoken.

49:08.966 --> 49:12.325
Tap-tap-tap.
Something rapping on his window.

49:13.633 --> 49:15.033
Tap-tap. There it is again.

49:15.133 --> 49:17.491
Like someone throwing pebbles up
at the windowpane.

49:17.591 --> 49:20.991
Looking out, Jimmy sees a figure
standing in the parking lot

49:21.091 --> 49:22.116
opposite his house.

49:22.216 --> 49:24.457
The figure steps into the streetlight.

49:24.966 --> 49:27.749
It's the girl in the picture.

49:28.425 --> 49:32.040
Jimmy's heart misses a beat.

49:32.425 --> 49:35.325
He wastes no time and quickly
rushes downstairs to see her.

49:35.425 --> 49:37.075
He races out of the house and...

49:41.716 --> 49:44.582
He is struck by a car
while crossing the street.

49:45.258 --> 49:48.457
Jimmy is killed instantly,
dead before he hits the ground.

49:50.716 --> 49:52.950
So, the police investigators arrive.

49:53.050 --> 49:55.450
They find a picture lying
next to the boy's body.

49:55.550 --> 49:57.707
It is a photograph
of a pretty young girl.

49:57.841 --> 49:59.749
The kind of smile that can

50:00.383 --> 50:02.249
break a boy's heart.

50:05.883 --> 50:08.991
And that, gentlemen, concludes my story.

50:09.091 --> 50:12.915
Oh, except to say that in this photo
the girl is holding up her fingers.

50:15.675 --> 50:17.457
Like this...

50:20.758 --> 50:22.290
That's good!

50:22.841 --> 50:24.283
That's bloody good, girl!

50:26.508 --> 50:28.374
Oh, my boys would love that!

50:29.758 --> 50:31.616
May I borrow your wife, Stanley?

50:31.716 --> 50:34.075
She's lightning in a bottle.

50:34.175 --> 50:35.866
Haven't you already got a wife?

50:37.175 --> 50:38.491
Well, you know what they say,

50:38.591 --> 50:41.582
one is company,
two's a crowd and three's a party.

50:42.675 --> 50:44.533
Dylan, dear,
I do believe it is your turn

50:44.633 --> 50:46.450
to entertain me with something that goes

50:46.550 --> 50:48.533
- bump in the night.
- Happy to oblige.

50:48.633 --> 50:51.832
But I don't think Stanley would approve.

50:56.508 --> 50:57.866
Are we sitting comfortably?

50:57.966 --> 50:59.915
Like biscuits and butter.

51:01.716 --> 51:03.950
Has anyone seen my Pouilly-Fuissé?

51:04.050 --> 51:05.533
I had three bottles.

51:05.633 --> 51:07.082
It's your turn.

51:08.341 --> 51:10.200
No, I don't... I don't want to.

51:10.300 --> 51:11.624
Come on.

51:12.300 --> 51:15.290
Let's see what a Harvard education
can bring to the party.

51:16.216 --> 51:19.325
You must have a ghost story or two
rattling around in that loaf of yours.

51:19.425 --> 51:20.950
Leave me alone, Dylan.

51:21.050 --> 51:22.790
I can help you, if you like.

51:23.675 --> 51:25.415
Once upon a time...

51:27.258 --> 51:30.082
Once... upon...

51:30.341 --> 51:32.124
What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?

51:32.300 --> 51:33.908
Come on, John. I know it's in there.

51:34.008 --> 51:36.874
A real horror to give us all
the gooseflesh.

51:37.050 --> 51:41.415
- Once... upon... a time...
- Detroit!

51:48.341 --> 51:50.450
Once upon a time in Detroit.

51:50.550 --> 51:53.158
Michigan? You can't make
friends with that.

51:53.258 --> 51:54.999
Shut up, Stan.

51:55.800 --> 51:59.749
Go on. You were saying, John?

52:03.758 --> 52:04.999
Detroit.

52:05.841 --> 52:07.290
1928.

52:08.716 --> 52:12.249
It was the hottest summer
the city had seen in over a decade.

52:13.341 --> 52:17.915
They said you could fry a hamburger
off the sidewalk on Woodward Avenue.

52:20.050 --> 52:21.832
I was 11 years old.

52:34.050 --> 52:36.874
There was a kid in the neighbourhood
called Billy Levitt.

52:38.383 --> 52:41.749
Had these two white mice he'd been
given from the school biology lab.

52:42.550 --> 52:44.415
Samson and Delilah.

52:46.883 --> 52:48.665
He carried them in a shoe box.

52:48.966 --> 52:50.540
Took them everywhere.

52:51.050 --> 52:54.457
I used to hang out with Billy
and his older brother Tommy.

52:56.883 --> 53:01.665
We had the whole summer stretching out
ahead of us, but after two weeks,

53:02.008 --> 53:06.540
playing stoop ball and skinny dipping
started to lose its edge for Tommy.

53:09.716 --> 53:12.499
What was called for was a new form of...

53:12.841 --> 53:14.374
entertainment.

53:24.091 --> 53:26.165
Tommy did Samson first.

53:27.716 --> 53:29.999
Cut off his tail with a bread knife.

53:32.175 --> 53:36.040
We watched the poor thing
roll around on the porch.

53:36.716 --> 53:38.249
Helpless.

53:39.925 --> 53:43.040
It must've been another ten minutes
before the mouse was dead.

53:46.216 --> 53:48.374
I can see Billy just standing there.

53:48.883 --> 53:50.457
Fighting back tears.

53:52.841 --> 53:54.582
The whole time watching.

53:58.591 --> 54:00.207
I couldn't look at Billy.

54:01.883 --> 54:03.624
We both knew what was coming.

54:07.675 --> 54:09.915
Tommy said it was my turn next.

54:11.008 --> 54:12.957
Delilah was all mine.

54:14.883 --> 54:17.415
He snuck into his old man's room and

54:17.550 --> 54:19.415
came back with a hypodermic.

54:20.050 --> 54:22.207
Their father was diabetic.

54:24.966 --> 54:28.075
He made Billy get some Drano
from the garage

54:28.175 --> 54:30.207
and together we filled the hypo.

54:32.591 --> 54:36.165
He even made Billy hold
the bottle steady.

54:40.300 --> 54:43.665
Delilah could sense something was up
before I tipped her out of the box.

54:48.300 --> 54:50.165
Tommy wouldn't let up.

54:51.800 --> 54:53.499
He just kept pushing...

54:55.425 --> 54:57.499
I knew there was no going back.

55:01.883 --> 55:03.790
I popped her with the needle.

55:05.050 --> 55:06.832
Pushed it all the way.

55:11.841 --> 55:13.665
This mouse, this...

55:14.925 --> 55:16.915
tiny little thing...

55:18.091 --> 55:20.415
balloons up in my hand.

55:21.091 --> 55:22.832
Like bubblegum.

55:26.675 --> 55:28.415
Tommy was pissing himself.

55:28.550 --> 55:29.874
Laughing.

55:33.341 --> 55:35.124
Billy wasn't watching.

55:36.425 --> 55:37.874
Not anymore.

55:45.758 --> 55:48.415
This thing in my hand, it just...

55:49.758 --> 55:51.540
splits wide open.

55:53.716 --> 55:55.207
I'm frozen.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.790
I can hear Tommy still laughing.

56:02.633 --> 56:04.249
My face is wet...

56:05.425 --> 56:08.415
And I start to realise it's not
just because I've been crying.

56:17.675 --> 56:19.499
It really was hot that summer.

56:26.883 --> 56:28.415
Well, bravo.

56:28.925 --> 56:32.290
That's certainly a...
memorable little story, John.

56:32.966 --> 56:35.116
If not technically scary.

56:35.216 --> 56:37.415
Tell that to the mice, Stan.

56:38.050 --> 56:39.749
I'm so sorry.

56:40.591 --> 56:42.040
Let him go.

56:57.591 --> 56:59.874
Seems I was wrong about this pigsty.

57:01.341 --> 57:04.124
Who needs New York
when you've neighbours like that?

57:05.716 --> 57:07.832
This place is hell on wheels. I like it.

57:09.591 --> 57:10.957
How's your jaw?

57:12.300 --> 57:13.665
I'll survive.

57:15.675 --> 57:17.874
Though I may be reading
at Yale with a lisp.

57:19.675 --> 57:21.457
Might make myself sound better.

57:35.550 --> 57:37.249
What happened to those boys?

57:38.800 --> 57:40.207
They grew up.

57:41.675 --> 57:43.540
Billy moved west.

57:44.008 --> 57:45.499
Tommy?

57:46.550 --> 57:48.165
I heard he died in the war.

57:49.050 --> 57:50.749
Somewhere in the Pacific.

57:53.383 --> 57:56.540
There are times I prefer
the human race when it sleeps.

57:58.675 --> 58:00.082
When we dream.

58:02.466 --> 58:05.457
That's quite a romantic notion
for a dollar-mad nightingale.

58:08.258 --> 58:10.124
Perhaps you should write about it.

58:10.966 --> 58:12.374
Perhaps I will.

58:13.925 --> 58:15.457
John Malcolm Brinnin.

58:16.550 --> 58:18.249
Perhaps I bloody will.

58:25.258 --> 58:27.082
Don't leave me to Stanley.

58:27.508 --> 58:29.249
He wants to talk Mantovani.

58:31.883 --> 58:33.540
Just give me a moment.

59:25.258 --> 59:27.283
Shit. Oh.

59:27.383 --> 59:28.957
What time is it?

59:29.675 --> 59:31.290
Did I miss anything?

59:31.841 --> 59:33.582
Oh, sorry, honey.

59:35.508 --> 59:37.290
Let's have a drink.

59:37.466 --> 59:39.325
You know, I had another bottle...

59:39.425 --> 59:41.374
Take me home, Stanley.

01:01:23.508 --> 01:01:26.624
- Hello boss-man.
- How's Superman?

01:01:26.841 --> 01:01:29.915
He's super. I'll pass him on
when I've finished.

01:01:31.425 --> 01:01:34.915
- Good night, Dylan.
- Good night... and John?

01:01:36.300 --> 01:01:37.624
I am ready.

01:01:38.508 --> 01:01:39.915
Yale, John.

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:43.124
Sleep well, yes?

01:02:04.716 --> 01:02:06.290
Dylan. Time to get up.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:15.915
Dylan?

01:02:32.091 --> 01:02:33.832
You bastard.

01:03:06.675 --> 01:03:08.207
Get up!

01:03:10.508 --> 01:03:11.915
John!

01:04:31.383 --> 01:04:33.374
You're a hard man to get hold of, John.

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:38.082
You've had half the Upper
East Side looking for you both.

01:04:38.341 --> 01:04:42.124
We were getting worried that John here
had shanghaied you off to Venus,

01:04:42.675 --> 01:04:44.575
Jupiter, Mars...

01:04:44.675 --> 01:04:46.790
No, just Connecticut.

01:04:49.425 --> 01:04:51.116
Mr. Torrance, isn't it?

01:04:51.216 --> 01:04:52.616
Mr. Thomas.

01:04:52.716 --> 01:04:54.832
Once again the pleasure is all yours.

01:04:57.383 --> 01:04:59.249
Gentlemen? Shall we?

01:05:52.175 --> 01:05:55.874
"And death shall have no dominion

01:06:00.591 --> 01:06:03.707
Dead men naked they shall be one

01:06:04.466 --> 01:06:07.832
With the man in the wind
and the west moon

01:06:08.216 --> 01:06:11.700
When their bones are picked clean
and the clean bones gone

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.624
They shall have stars at elbow and foot

01:06:16.675 --> 01:06:19.575
Though they go mad they shall be sane

01:06:19.675 --> 01:06:23.707
Though they sink through the sea
they shall rise again

01:06:24.716 --> 01:06:27.082
Though lovers be lost

01:06:27.675 --> 01:06:30.165
Love shall not

01:06:31.216 --> 01:06:34.249
And death shall have no dominion

01:06:36.383 --> 01:06:39.415
Under the windings of the sea

01:06:39.675 --> 01:06:43.540
They lying long shall not die windily

01:06:43.716 --> 01:06:47.158
Twisting on racks when sinews give way

01:06:47.258 --> 01:06:51.332
Strapped to a wheel
yet they shall not break"

01:07:34.716 --> 01:07:37.290
So, how are you finding America,
Mr. Thomas?

01:07:37.466 --> 01:07:38.915
Very big.

01:07:39.758 --> 01:07:41.665
Especially when you have no friends.

01:07:42.591 --> 01:07:45.200
Well, hopefully that will be rectified
here in Connecticut.

01:07:45.300 --> 01:07:47.658
I understand Mr. Thomas's
next port of call is Boston?

01:07:47.758 --> 01:07:50.040
- Isn't that right, John?
- Harvard.

01:07:55.008 --> 01:07:57.665
It's an Ivy League thing.
Friendly rivalry.

01:07:58.216 --> 01:08:01.158
Some of us might debate
the very definition of friendly.

01:08:01.258 --> 01:08:02.874
Speaking as a son of Eli,

01:08:03.091 --> 01:08:06.665
the 1935 Game left me
in traction till Christmas.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:09.099
You were a Bulldog?

01:08:10.091 --> 01:08:11.499
Tailback.

01:08:11.675 --> 01:08:13.207
Last game I played.

01:08:13.508 --> 01:08:15.874
Those Crimsons played rough house.

01:08:16.133 --> 01:08:19.040
Two bust ribs and an open leg fracture.

01:08:19.716 --> 01:08:21.700
But it was worth it. 14-7.

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:29.533
Boola, boola, boola, boola

01:08:29.633 --> 01:08:30.783
A fellow poet?

01:08:30.883 --> 01:08:33.915
You might have some competition,
Mr. Thomas.

01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:39.075
Wasn't Gerald Ford assistant
varsity coach back in '35?

01:08:39.175 --> 01:08:40.866
- He was indeed, sir.
- Yeah.

01:08:40.966 --> 01:08:43.658
The Congressman's Congressman.

01:08:43.758 --> 01:08:47.707
We could use some of that Bulldog
spirit in the House right now.

01:08:48.216 --> 01:08:50.082
What do you think, Mr. Brinnin?

01:08:51.091 --> 01:08:52.783
John here is a Cantab.

01:08:52.883 --> 01:08:55.374
His Eli sympathies may be...

01:08:55.508 --> 01:08:56.825
a little spare.

01:08:56.925 --> 01:08:59.874
Well, University of Michigan, actually.

01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:02.124
I did graduate work at Harvard.

01:09:03.591 --> 01:09:05.207
Don't be hard on, John.

01:09:06.716 --> 01:09:10.040
He's promised me the two things
I seek most from America.

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.790
What might they be, Mr. Thomas?

01:09:13.591 --> 01:09:15.290
To meet Charlie Chaplin

01:09:15.550 --> 01:09:18.582
and have a date
with an ash blonde movie star.

01:09:18.883 --> 01:09:20.700
I take it he doesn't mean Lassie.

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:33.741
Do you have something to say,
Mr. Thomas?

01:09:33.841 --> 01:09:35.290
Gentlemen...

01:09:36.133 --> 01:09:38.124
at times like this,

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:42.415
I wish we were all hermaphrodites.

01:09:44.841 --> 01:09:46.499
Why do you wish that?

01:09:46.633 --> 01:09:48.415
Because...

01:09:49.841 --> 01:09:51.957
then we could all fuck ourselves!

01:09:54.633 --> 01:09:56.582
There was a girl called Alice

01:09:57.008 --> 01:09:59.332
Who used a dynamite stick as a phallus.

01:09:59.841 --> 01:10:03.491
They found her vagina in North Carolina
And bits of her tits in Dallas!

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:06.249
Oh, don't go...

01:10:06.425 --> 01:10:08.207
I've got plenty more in the tank.

01:10:10.716 --> 01:10:12.325
Perhaps another time.

01:10:12.425 --> 01:10:14.700
I must excuse Mr. Thomas's
volubility in...

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.491
We're all grown ups here, John.

01:10:16.591 --> 01:10:18.082
That's debatable.

01:10:19.133 --> 01:10:21.082
A whore from Timbuktu

01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:23.249
Filled her vagina with glue

01:10:23.508 --> 01:10:25.707
She said with a grin,
"If they pay to get in,

01:10:26.175 --> 01:10:28.665
They can pay to get out again too!"

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:31.999
There was a plumber from Leigh

01:10:32.216 --> 01:10:34.290
Who was plumbing his girl by the sea

01:10:34.550 --> 01:10:36.207
She said, "Stop your plumbing

01:10:36.508 --> 01:10:37.950
Somebody's coming."

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:40.374
And the plumber still plumbing said...

01:10:42.550 --> 01:10:43.915
"It's me."

01:11:45.675 --> 01:11:47.665
This is better than Coney Island.

01:11:49.425 --> 01:11:51.874
Who knew a poet could be so versatile?

01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:54.874
Do you think Auden or Eliot
do this sort of thing?

01:11:55.216 --> 01:11:58.249
Maybe one hula hoops
while the other plays trumpet?

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.749
You wanna see a versatile poet?

01:12:01.008 --> 01:12:03.116
First, I'm gonna drink this
bottle of Scotch.

01:12:03.216 --> 01:12:05.540
Then, I'm gonna look for
a bottle of vodka.

01:12:09.300 --> 01:12:10.749
It's not that funny.

01:12:10.966 --> 01:12:13.707
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

01:12:15.091 --> 01:12:16.415
You want to know why?

01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:20.332
You're not even a poet anymore.

01:12:22.216 --> 01:12:25.290
Hey, don't shoot the messenger.

01:12:26.591 --> 01:12:28.624
You made your bed. New vocation.

01:12:29.383 --> 01:12:31.499
You're a sideshow huckster now.

01:12:31.633 --> 01:12:33.624
With your very own circus bear.

01:12:34.383 --> 01:12:37.332
Well, I guess you would know
about that sort of thing.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.033
Is that how you danced for Loomis
and the school committee?

01:12:40.133 --> 01:12:41.533
Turning tricks for monkey nuts?

01:12:41.633 --> 01:12:44.082
Slow down, mister.
You forget who you're talking to.

01:12:44.425 --> 01:12:48.499
Actually, I've been asking myself
that very question these last few days.

01:12:49.508 --> 01:12:50.957
Who are you, Jack?

01:12:51.550 --> 01:12:52.866
I don't know.

01:12:52.966 --> 01:12:54.241
Just who the hell are you?

01:12:54.341 --> 01:12:56.741
I'm the guy who could have
saved your ass.

01:12:58.591 --> 01:13:02.700
But it is too late now, because your star
act told the Provost of Yale

01:13:02.800 --> 01:13:04.457
to go fuck himself.

01:13:04.925 --> 01:13:06.415
No, strike that.

01:13:06.633 --> 01:13:09.082
The Provost, the Vice-Chancellor,

01:13:09.258 --> 01:13:12.165
the Associate Vice-Chancellor,
Endowed Professors

01:13:12.466 --> 01:13:15.165
and half the collegiate board
of governors. Yale.

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:18.707
Fucking Yale.

01:13:21.466 --> 01:13:24.082
What? What's so funny?

01:13:24.258 --> 01:13:27.832
To Jack. Good ol' Jack.

01:13:28.883 --> 01:13:30.832
There is just one thing
I wanted to know.

01:13:31.008 --> 01:13:32.533
What was your angle?

01:13:32.633 --> 01:13:33.950
It's been bugging me.

01:13:34.050 --> 01:13:35.741
Professional jealousy?

01:13:35.841 --> 01:13:38.165
Proving inadequacy on my part?

01:13:38.591 --> 01:13:41.207
Did you want the
sponsorship money for yourself?

01:13:41.341 --> 01:13:42.665
What is it?

01:13:42.883 --> 01:13:45.582
Or, or... another paternity suit?

01:13:46.466 --> 01:13:47.700
Damn! Those cheerleaders...

01:13:47.800 --> 01:13:49.290
You faggot.

01:13:52.050 --> 01:13:54.665
Get over it. You're done.

01:14:04.425 --> 01:14:05.832
Poor John.

01:14:07.258 --> 01:14:08.707
I did warn you.

01:14:10.008 --> 01:14:11.915
Hold on to the straps, kid.

01:14:12.841 --> 01:14:14.207
When I'm done,

01:14:14.508 --> 01:14:18.575
you're going to be teaching Mother Goose
to Polak kids up in Greenpoint.

01:14:35.425 --> 01:14:40.325
She was a fishmonger
and it was no wonder

01:14:40.425 --> 01:14:45.700
As were her mother and father before

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:49.700
They both wheeled
their barrows through streets

01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:54.082
Broad and narrow,
crying cockles and mussels

01:14:55.050 --> 01:14:57.707
Alive a-live-oh

01:14:57.966 --> 01:15:02.616
Alive a-live-oh alive a-live-oh

01:15:02.716 --> 01:15:07.457
Crying cockles and mussels
alive a-live-oh

01:15:07.675 --> 01:15:09.040
She was...

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:15.040
She died of a fever

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:19.158
No one could relieve her

01:15:19.258 --> 01:15:23.207
And that was the end of sweet...

01:15:28.716 --> 01:15:31.249
The ghost wheeled her barrow...

01:15:31.883 --> 01:15:33.957
Through streets...

01:15:35.341 --> 01:15:36.832
Let's go.

01:16:39.675 --> 01:16:42.499
We're home. Casa Brinnin.

01:16:44.675 --> 01:16:46.999
- Was I asleep long?
- Enough.

01:16:48.883 --> 01:16:50.457
You slept enough.

01:16:51.633 --> 01:16:52.832
Good.

01:16:59.050 --> 01:17:01.540
We made a holy show last night.

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.124
Did we?

01:17:04.675 --> 01:17:08.165
It's probably spread like a bush fire
across every East Coast campus.

01:17:09.841 --> 01:17:11.374
Fuck them in the eye, John.

01:17:11.716 --> 01:17:14.874
And the ear, we were drunk.

01:17:15.675 --> 01:17:19.124
Any person with a beating heart
could see and understand that.

01:17:19.966 --> 01:17:21.540
If not, they don't matter.

01:17:24.133 --> 01:17:26.707
Jack's probably at breakfast
with Loomis now.

01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:30.124
Sharing his political... take.

01:17:31.925 --> 01:17:33.790
I can feel them laughing at me.

01:17:37.008 --> 01:17:38.957
I'll pack my things on Monday.

01:17:40.091 --> 01:17:41.749
Say fuck, John.

01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.082
Say arse and shit

01:17:45.258 --> 01:17:47.374
and kick those ghosts out of your bed.

01:17:48.591 --> 01:17:49.957
I wouldn't worry.

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:53.999
No, you wouldn't, would you!

01:17:56.716 --> 01:17:58.366
And you dropped this.

01:17:58.466 --> 01:18:00.415
You dropped it three times last night.

01:18:01.466 --> 01:18:03.624
And you accuse me of being scared.

01:18:11.675 --> 01:18:13.332
No, you don't!

01:18:24.383 --> 01:18:25.665
If you're ready?

01:18:44.966 --> 01:18:48.040
Fuck. Ass. Shit.

01:19:35.508 --> 01:19:39.374
If only you took this long
in the bedroom to open me up.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.457
Little man.

01:19:46.091 --> 01:19:47.790
Half man.

01:19:48.675 --> 01:19:50.582
Crumpled boy.

01:19:59.841 --> 01:20:03.082
What gives you courage now,
my curious child?

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:07.624
What woman has left her scent on you,

01:20:08.425 --> 01:20:12.790
her dirty stain, that's given you
courage to come back to me?

01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:14.866
There's only you...

01:20:14.966 --> 01:20:16.624
Stop!

01:20:17.383 --> 01:20:19.124
You've left holes.

01:20:20.841 --> 01:20:23.415
Holes that need to be filled,

01:20:25.133 --> 01:20:27.124
my little cherub,

01:20:27.550 --> 01:20:29.874
my angel eyed demon.

01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.624
Holes in our children's stomachs.

01:20:33.883 --> 01:20:35.540
They're starving.

01:20:36.425 --> 01:20:40.325
Starving in a way a child
should never be made to starve.

01:20:40.425 --> 01:20:42.457
They're starving!

01:20:45.425 --> 01:20:49.915
Holes in our home which were once
stuffed full with your shapeless body.

01:20:50.883 --> 01:20:52.499
And holes in me,

01:20:53.050 --> 01:20:54.957
holes that I've tried to fill,

01:20:55.383 --> 01:20:56.915
with drink...

01:20:59.550 --> 01:21:00.957
and words...

01:21:02.133 --> 01:21:03.832
and reason...

01:21:05.966 --> 01:21:07.624
little food...

01:21:08.341 --> 01:21:11.707
and the odd land craving sailor.

01:21:16.383 --> 01:21:18.249
You know I'm spoiled.

01:21:22.008 --> 01:21:23.915
Why do you need me so?

01:21:26.966 --> 01:21:28.249
This is it...

01:21:29.550 --> 01:21:32.450
This is how it has to be
until we devour each other.

01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:34.415
Until we are set free.

01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:46.582
You had to come.

01:21:47.508 --> 01:21:49.374
You had to come here, didn't you?

01:21:51.925 --> 01:21:57.249
You're not finished yet.

01:22:21.841 --> 01:22:23.207
Dylan?

01:22:24.883 --> 01:22:28.499
Dylan! Where are you?

01:22:30.216 --> 01:22:31.665
Dylan?

01:22:32.258 --> 01:22:33.874
Where did you go?

01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:43.540
Can I get you anything?

01:22:53.716 --> 01:22:54.999
What a woman!

01:22:55.175 --> 01:22:59.165
What a ground shaking
celestial furnace of a creature.

01:23:00.216 --> 01:23:04.499
"Come back to us our angel
of rhyme and life giver." Ha!

01:23:04.675 --> 01:23:06.616
She's a better writer than me,
always has been.

01:23:06.716 --> 01:23:08.374
Look at her penmanship?

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.665
And those thighs!

01:23:12.425 --> 01:23:13.915
I can't waste anymore time.

01:23:14.216 --> 01:23:16.533
- Waste?
- The Boston train's tomorrow,

01:23:16.633 --> 01:23:19.207
early, mustn't be late.

01:23:19.925 --> 01:23:22.575
Prepared, be prepared.

01:23:22.675 --> 01:23:24.741
I'll pack now. Come on, John.

01:23:24.841 --> 01:23:26.415
Waste your time?

01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:29.207
There is nothing left
you can take from me, is there?

01:23:29.383 --> 01:23:30.533
I'm empty.

01:23:30.633 --> 01:23:33.783
You have gorged on my heart
and mind and left me nothing.

01:23:33.883 --> 01:23:36.624
- Take it easy, John.
- You selfish vampire!

01:23:39.466 --> 01:23:41.091
Vampire?

01:23:49.050 --> 01:23:50.624
What did that woman say?

01:23:51.091 --> 01:23:53.116
My wife, John!
It's none of your business.

01:23:53.216 --> 01:23:54.991
What did she say that awoke you
from your dream?

01:23:55.091 --> 01:23:56.241
I need to know.

01:23:56.341 --> 01:23:57.700
What is it she can scribble down...

01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.825
- Stop it, John.
- In her violent

01:23:58.925 --> 01:24:01.408
cheap-hand that eclipses
my entire being.

01:24:01.508 --> 01:24:03.950
- Stop it!
- That bitch!

01:24:06.425 --> 01:24:09.832
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

01:24:31.841 --> 01:24:34.165
Sorry I wasn't enough for you.

01:24:35.425 --> 01:24:37.040
You were never meant to be.

01:24:40.133 --> 01:24:41.832
There is no secret, John.

01:24:42.716 --> 01:24:44.415
No Holy Grail.

01:24:45.425 --> 01:24:47.374
Just what's in front of all of us.

01:24:50.133 --> 01:24:51.540
Don't open a book.

01:24:53.091 --> 01:24:54.457
Open a window.

01:25:57.925 --> 01:26:00.199
"A stranger has come

01:26:00.966 --> 01:26:04.874
To share my room in the house
not right in the head

01:26:05.508 --> 01:26:07.874
A girl mad as birds

01:26:08.883 --> 01:26:10.749
Bolting the night of the door

01:26:11.050 --> 01:26:13.665
With her arm her plume

01:26:14.258 --> 01:26:16.374
Strait in the mazed bed

01:26:17.216 --> 01:26:20.832
She deludes the heaven-proof house
with entering clouds

01:26:21.383 --> 01:26:25.124
Yet she deludes with walking
the nightmarish room

01:26:26.050 --> 01:26:27.790
At large as the dead

01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.915
Or rides the imagined oceans
of the male wards

01:26:32.466 --> 01:26:34.749
She has come possessed

01:26:35.050 --> 01:26:37.499
Who admits the delusive light

01:26:37.925 --> 01:26:40.249
Through the bouncing wall

01:26:40.383 --> 01:26:42.790
Possessed by the skies

01:26:43.425 --> 01:26:47.624
She sleeps in the narrow trough
yet she walks the dust

01:26:48.008 --> 01:26:50.374
Yet raves at her will

01:26:50.883 --> 01:26:55.124
On the madhouse boards worn
thin by my walking tears

01:26:55.716 --> 01:27:00.665
And taken by light in her arms
at long and dear last

01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:03.790
I may without fail

01:27:04.091 --> 01:27:08.290
Suffer the first vision
that set fire to the stars"

01:27:38.716 --> 01:27:41.075
Once you get to Boston
there will be a driver waiting.

01:27:41.175 --> 01:27:44.908
Their Dean wants to introduce you
and you're committed to two 20-minute sets.

01:27:45.008 --> 01:27:47.957
I'll let them know about
your travel arrangements in the morning.

01:27:48.716 --> 01:27:49.825
Thank you.

01:27:49.925 --> 01:27:52.908
I have taken the liberty of advancing you
money for the next two weeks

01:27:53.008 --> 01:27:55.332
and have portioned
some into an envelope for home.

01:27:57.341 --> 01:27:59.040
Perhaps you can wire it to Caitlin?

01:28:01.633 --> 01:28:03.040
Thank you, John.

01:28:07.050 --> 01:28:08.075
Dylan?

01:28:08.175 --> 01:28:11.790
I now know what you mean
when you say it is about feelings.

01:28:12.758 --> 01:28:14.157
Something...

01:28:18.416 --> 01:28:22.499
Let's get you to the station.
So you can terrorise somebody else.

"Now as I was young
and easy under the apple boughs

01:29:30.425 --> 01:29:34.415
About the lilting house
and happy as the grass was green

01:29:35.425 --> 01:29:40.874
The night above the dingle starry,
time let me hail and climb

01:29:41.925 --> 01:29:44.832
Golden in the heydays of his eyes

01:29:45.675 --> 01:29:49.999
And honoured among wagons
I was prince of the apple towns

01:29:50.466 --> 01:29:55.540
And once below a time I lordly
had the trees and leaves

01:29:56.091 --> 01:29:58.957
Trail with daisies and barley

01:29:59.966 --> 01:30:03.124
Down the rivers of the windfall light"
