01:09.194 --> 01:11.846

01:11.946 --> 01:16.476
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky

01:16.576 --> 01:20.230

01:27.003 --> 01:31.373
I'm gonna go

01:46.689 --> 01:49.843
Prepare yourself, you know it's a must

01:49.943 --> 01:53.847
Gotta have a friend in Jesus

01:53.947 --> 01:57.308
So you know that when you die

01:57.408 --> 02:01.271
He's gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky

02:01.371 --> 02:05.150
Gonna recommend you

02:35.113 --> 02:38.850
Oh, thank you very much.
May I trouble you for a pillow?

02:38.950 --> 02:40.984
- Sure.
- Great. Thank you.

03:14.986 --> 03:18.056
The temperature in Miami
is currently 86 degrees and muggy.

03:18.156 --> 03:21.101
We will be starting our descent
for landing in just a few moments...

03:21.201 --> 03:24.604
Herman Gotlieb...

03:24.704 --> 03:26.272
Gotlieb.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.024
Please remain seated
with your seat belts on

03:28.124 --> 03:30.826
until the captain has
turned off the seat belt sign.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.959
All passengers holding tickets

03:46.059 --> 03:50.345

please come to the ticket counter.

04:02.158 --> 04:03.977
Hey.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.153
Wow, thanks.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.069
All passengers leaving on Flight 266

04:13.169 --> 04:16.488
please go directly
to the check-in desk at Gate 6.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.241
All passengers leaving...

Hi.

04:20.009 --> 04:23.163
Please go directly
to the check-in desk at Gate 6.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.880
Hi.

04:26.140 --> 04:29.836
Hi there. Going home?
I'd like to tell you about a book.

04:29.936 --> 04:33.847
It's a classic of the Vedic literature,
"The Knowledge of God."

04:35.900 --> 04:37.517
Have you seen the movie "Gandhi?"

04:40.280 --> 04:42.731
My name's Ravindra. What's your name?

04:43.700 --> 04:45.019
Trouble.

05:29.537 --> 05:30.939
Mr. Gotlieb.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.613
You know, anything you want...

05:38.713 --> 05:41.414
Hey, send me up a girl, Pablo. Now.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.869
You got any of that hundred
I gave you last week?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.579
I got all of it, man.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.873
But I'm not lending you no more money.

05:48.973 --> 05:51.668
Come on, Blink.
Look, 50 bucks till payday.

05:59.484 --> 06:01.768
Moseley. Homicide.

06:03.654 --> 06:05.139
A what died?

06:05.239 --> 06:07.857
All right. Right away.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.480
I'll pay to find the dumbbell killers.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.030
What's it worth to you?

06:16.042 --> 06:18.987
$61 .35.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.496
$65.59.

06:27.136 --> 06:28.454
Thanks, Blink.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.131
Hey, man, replace your teeth.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.940
Hi.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.901
Pablo sent me.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.610
How old are you anyway?

06:59.710 --> 07:03.038
19. And my name is Pepper.

07:04.715 --> 07:07.417
You got a driver's license
on you, Pepper?

07:20.907 --> 07:23.433
What's wrong with Susan Waggoner?

07:24.402 --> 07:28.222
You know, Susie, this license here
says you're 23 years old.

07:28.322 --> 07:29.981
I know what it says.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.942
You can call me Junior.

07:34.370 --> 07:36.230
You around a size 7?

07:36.330 --> 07:37.690
Where?

07:37.790 --> 07:39.150
Dress.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.568
Oh.

07:40.668 --> 07:43.536
Uh... 6.

07:44.964 --> 07:47.450
Sometimes 7. Depends on...

07:47.550 --> 07:51.419
- Here. Try this on.
- Okay.

07:52.555 --> 07:55.458
Could you turn around, please?

07:55.558 --> 07:57.300
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.071
Okay.

08:18.915 --> 08:20.483
Can you zip me up?

08:20.583 --> 08:22.075
Yeah.

08:30.510 --> 08:31.876
Oh...

08:36.765 --> 08:39.168
That looks nice to me.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.443
You want me to wear it?

08:42.269 --> 08:45.390
Fuck, no. I want you to buy it.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.980
50 bucks?

08:55.535 --> 08:57.610
It might be worth a suck.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.658
Is that what you're getting
for a suck these days, 50 bucks?

09:05.211 --> 09:06.870
Christ.

09:07.755 --> 09:10.165
Where'd you get all these nice things?

09:12.260 --> 09:16.581
Oh, when I left my wife,
I took 'em with me.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.916
Figure I paid for 'em.
They're my clothes, right?

09:19.016 --> 09:20.675
Oh.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.341
You left your wife?

09:27.441 --> 09:29.969
How long you been working for Pablo?

09:30.069 --> 09:33.514
Since the beginning of the semester.
I go to Miami-Dade.

09:33.614 --> 09:36.476
I-I'm majoring in business,
but I also take English classes...

09:36.576 --> 09:38.686
Yeah, well, the first thing
they should have taught you

09:38.786 --> 09:42.106
at your hooker classes
is you shouldn't ask the client

09:42.206 --> 09:44.324
so many fucking personal questions.

09:51.173 --> 09:52.749
I'm sorry.

09:55.845 --> 09:58.213
Are you going to call down
and cancel me now?

09:59.098 --> 10:01.667
That's okay. Don't feel bad about it.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.837
Um... I hope, uh...
the next girl's more to your liking,

10:04.937 --> 10:07.965
and I hope that you enjoy
your stay in Florida. Mr. Gotlieb.

10:08.065 --> 10:12.060
- I'm giving you your dress back.
- No, forget about the dress.

10:12.903 --> 10:14.395
Honey...

10:16.574 --> 10:19.984
If I upset you, I'm sorry.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.022
So you want me to stay?

10:23.122 --> 10:24.906
Yeah.

10:30.421 --> 10:33.157
Okay, then.

10:33.257 --> 10:34.791
Let's do it.

10:43.976 --> 10:46.254
Ready?

10:46.354 --> 10:47.887
Turn over.

11:23.182 --> 11:24.799
Is something wrong?

11:31.273 --> 11:34.225
I haven't been with a woman
in a long time.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.647
Oh.

11:44.829 --> 11:46.487
Wow.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.582
I'm sorry.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.108
Nobody kisses us.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.344
"Pepper."

12:41.343 --> 12:43.162
Okay, Henderson, what's up?

12:43.262 --> 12:46.040
These two Krishnas have been working
the airport for a couple of months.

12:46.140 --> 12:48.709
Now they'd been warned
about bugging the passengers.

12:48.809 --> 12:51.621
- Should've listened.
- Yeah.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.881
How was he killed?

12:53.981 --> 12:56.300
He fucked with some guy
wearing a suede leather sport coat.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.012
So the guy takes his finger,
bends it back, breaks it, then disappears.

13:00.112 --> 13:02.556
Now the witness lady says
she thinks that, uh...

13:02.656 --> 13:04.350
well, he hopped on one
of the hotel courtesy vans.

13:04.450 --> 13:05.768
We got a partial description.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.228
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

13:07.328 --> 13:09.855
The Krishna died of a broken finger?

13:10.849 --> 13:12.433
I mean, is that a homicide?

13:12.533 --> 13:14.492
Well, I guess he died of shock.

13:15.961 --> 13:18.746
Well, it hurts like hell
to have your finger bent back.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.701
My sister used to do it
to me when I was a kid.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.202
Yeah, but you didn't die.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.246
Now, if this was an accident...

13:25.346 --> 13:28.631
it'd be simple assault, right?

13:29.809 --> 13:34.463
However... if the guy
in the suede sport coat

13:34.563 --> 13:37.633
knew that Krishnas
had a bad habit of dying

13:37.733 --> 13:39.969
every time you bent their finger back...

13:43.489 --> 13:45.148
- Murder one?
- Yeah.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.936
Boy, the guys at the station
are going to laugh their asses off.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.105
Yeah.

13:51.205 --> 13:52.898
Your turn to notify next of kin.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.484
No way!
I did the fat lady that sat on a kid.

13:55.584 --> 13:59.029
- That's good for two.
- Next week?

13:59.129 --> 14:01.157
I'll be retired by then.

14:01.857 --> 14:03.762
Shit.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.371
Well, you try the hotels.

14:07.471 --> 14:11.250
See if anyone got off one of their
courtesy vans wearing a suede sport coat.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.092
Ah, shit.

14:19.775 --> 14:21.267
This is good here.

15:39.688 --> 15:41.514
Oh, excuse me.

15:57.039 --> 16:00.366
- Maybe we should try in here.
- All right, all right.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.502
Price check. Uzi squirt gun.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.300
Disregard.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.390
What's up?

17:16.617 --> 17:18.686
In the bag. In the bag. Now!

17:18.787 --> 17:21.065
Against the wall. Against the wall. Now!

17:21.165 --> 17:23.031
Be cool. Be cool. Be cool, brother.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.073
Hey, he's got a gun!

17:29.173 --> 17:31.290
Let's get out of here! Move it!

17:47.566 --> 17:50.344
Give me a day's notice
before it runs out, okay?

17:50.444 --> 17:52.262
Wednesday.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.230
Tell me Tuesday.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.856
Looky, looky, looky.

18:02.956 --> 18:05.192
We got a million dollars.

18:05.292 --> 18:10.413
We got a million... Brazilian dollars.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.374
Absolutely worthless.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.627
That's a lot of money, man.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.172
That's a lot of fucking money.

18:21.683 --> 18:26.721
I don't think you are
a Porsche customer...

18:27.564 --> 18:29.008
Mr. Frenger.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.976
I don't think you really
want to buy a Porsche.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.305
Do you want to buy a Porsche?

18:35.405 --> 18:38.232
No, man! I'm here to waste my time.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.648
How much for the speedboat, man?

18:44.748 --> 18:49.153
Oh, the speedboat
is very expensive, sir.

18:49.253 --> 18:53.414
That speedboat is $50,000.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.369
Wrap it up, man.

18:57.469 --> 19:00.664
Yeah, the bellman said
some guy matching the description

19:00.764 --> 19:02.875
got off a courtesy van,
registered, yeah.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.334
Got a name?

19:04.434 --> 19:06.962
Name was, uh... Herman Gotlieb.

19:07.062 --> 19:10.466
Yeah. I'm in the room right now.

19:10.566 --> 19:11.884
Coat's here, too.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.094
Coat? What else?

19:14.194 --> 19:17.931
Well, the bellman also said
the guy had a hooker with him, yeah.

19:18.031 --> 19:20.559
- No lie?
- I got an address on her.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.102
- An address?
- Right.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.562
Oh, man.

19:23.662 --> 19:26.190
Got a pen handy there, Hoke?

19:26.290 --> 19:29.075
Give me the hooker's address.

19:49.396 --> 19:52.264
- Hi!
- Hey.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.555
You showed up. I brought you a present.

19:58.655 --> 20:01.190
Oh, really? I got you one, too.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.061
A present from a client.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.987
Well, hey, I'm more than a client.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.485
"Shit happens when you party naked!"

20:11.585 --> 20:12.903
Look at us.

20:13.003 --> 20:14.613
I was just gonna get you
the plain "Shit happens,"

20:14.713 --> 20:17.157
but I thought you'd like
the "party naked" part.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.959
Hey, that's the best part.

20:21.678 --> 20:25.207
Hi. Um... circe salad, Noira.
It's real good, Junior.

20:25.307 --> 20:26.667
Two.

20:26.767 --> 20:28.134
Right away.

20:30.187 --> 20:32.680
So, uh... Susie...

20:33.732 --> 20:36.051
tell me how you wound up
living in Miami.

20:36.151 --> 20:39.263
Oh, I got a job
at a Burger World up in Hollywood

20:39.363 --> 20:41.014
and I was gonna, you know

20:41.114 --> 20:42.558
save up and get my own franchise

20:42.658 --> 20:46.103
but Pablo offered me this job.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.106
Well, it pays a whole lot better.

20:49.206 --> 20:51.108
This is a nice cup, Junior.

20:51.208 --> 20:53.110
I'm gonna get a lot of use out of this.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.112
It's a good cup.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.114
Hey, did you see the swimmers?

20:57.214 --> 20:59.116
That's why I picked this place.

20:59.216 --> 21:01.118
They do, like, a water ballet.

21:01.218 --> 21:03.495
Ballet in the water. I like it.

21:03.595 --> 21:04.997
'Cause I like to swim myself.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.623
I'd rather do that kind
of work, you know?

21:06.723 --> 21:08.125
But you gotta train for a long time.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.128
So now I want to take
a Spanish course in college.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.755
You know, in my business,
a lot of people don't speak English.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.133
So I think I'd be better at it if I spoke...
thank you.

21:16.233 --> 21:18.844
- We'll take a check now.
- Yes, sir.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.679
You know, like, well, Cuban, also.

21:20.779 --> 21:24.440
And I think that's sort of like Spanish,
Cuban, but it's a little different.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.448
This ice cream dressing is sour as shit.

21:34.167 --> 21:37.237
It's yogurt dressing, not ice cream.

21:37.337 --> 21:38.655
Where you been?

21:38.755 --> 21:41.617
Oh, that's okay.

21:41.717 --> 21:44.745
I never had yogurt dressing
up in Okeechobee.

21:44.845 --> 21:46.163
Where is that?

21:46.263 --> 21:49.917
That's where I'm from.
You heard of Lake Okeechobee.

21:50.017 --> 21:53.253
I'm from California.
I don't know shit about Florida.

21:53.353 --> 21:55.172
You ever heard of Lake Tahoe?

21:55.272 --> 21:56.798
Lake Tahoe?

21:56.898 --> 22:00.726
- How is it?
- Lousy.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.182
- Who is he?
- We're engaged.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.934
Hey, separate checks.

22:07.034 --> 22:09.978
- My treat.
- Good luck.

22:10.078 --> 22:13.322
Hey, Susie we're not gonna be
calling it a night, are we?

22:14.708 --> 22:17.611
I got a homework paper.
I gotta write a haiku for English class.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.488
I tell you what.

22:19.588 --> 22:22.366
I'm real good at making up things,
you know, poems.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.868
I could come over.
I could help you write your, uh...

22:24.968 --> 22:28.538
- Haiku?
- Definitely.

22:28.638 --> 22:30.207
Okay.

22:30.307 --> 22:32.466
Let's get out of here.

22:38.607 --> 22:41.551
Thank you. I'm sorry. I liked the food.

22:41.651 --> 22:43.018
Bye.

22:43.904 --> 22:47.523
So you think this unidentified
assailant who broke, uh...

22:50.327 --> 22:52.528
Ravindra's finger did it on purpose?

22:59.836 --> 23:02.204
Sorry, uh... Ramba.

23:03.548 --> 23:05.499
That's all right.

23:34.371 --> 23:37.072
That was a short engagement.

24:02.524 --> 24:06.303
Hey, you know, you still
haven't told me what it is you do.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.562
Oh, I got investments.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.691
I take people's money
and put it to work.

24:13.952 --> 24:15.653
You got any?

24:19.916 --> 24:22.361
I got a $10,000 CD

24:22.461 --> 24:26.163
and I take the interest from that,
and I put it into a N.O.W. account.

24:27.924 --> 24:29.951
Jesus Christ.

24:30.051 --> 24:32.496
That's the biggest
frigging racket going.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.498
I want you to march straight down

24:34.598 --> 24:36.375
to the bank first thing in the morning

24:36.475 --> 24:38.335
and cash in both of those things.

24:38.435 --> 24:43.097
I can't let my fiancee get ripped-off
when I can double your money.

24:43.982 --> 24:47.017
- Double?
- Yeah.

24:49.446 --> 24:52.398
Hey. Hey.

24:55.994 --> 24:58.696
How 'bout that poem we were gonna write?

25:02.209 --> 25:03.575
Okay.

25:07.547 --> 25:10.124
We make love a lot.

25:12.636 --> 25:16.081
We make love right now.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.424
No, it's seven in the second line.

25:20.810 --> 25:23.137
- Seven in the second line?
- Uh-huh.

25:26.983 --> 25:30.804
Splashes around... in his pond

25:30.904 --> 25:33.105
Could you close the door, please?

25:45.502 --> 25:48.078
Thinking... he's...

25:55.595 --> 25:57.296
alone.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.307
Breaking... entering...

26:10.318 --> 26:15.397
the dark... and lonely place... places.

26:22.998 --> 26:25.407
Finding a...

26:26.918 --> 26:28.744
big gun.

26:33.758 --> 26:35.118
Yeah.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.711
Smelling like a rose.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.103
- Any luck?
- I wrote two.

27:02.203 --> 27:04.481
Wow, maybe I'll get extra credit.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.650
Hey, where'd you get these?

27:06.750 --> 27:10.362
Dumb question. Are you a nosy rosy?

27:11.480 --> 27:13.774
What the hell was that, man?

27:13.874 --> 27:16.117
The doorbell.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.085
Talk about dumb questions.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.958
- Yes?
- Susan Waggoner?

27:23.058 --> 27:24.633
- Uh-huh.
- Can I come in?

27:28.355 --> 27:30.173
I bet you're Herman Gotlieb.

27:30.273 --> 27:32.474
How much?

27:34.611 --> 27:36.471
Sergeant Hoke Moseley. Homicide.

27:36.571 --> 27:38.640
Herman Gotlieb.

27:38.740 --> 27:41.434
I'd like to ask you
a few questions. Routine.

27:41.534 --> 27:43.520
Boy, you got a grip there, Herman.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.689
Been working out?

27:45.789 --> 27:48.233
Can I get you a cold one there, Sarge?

27:48.333 --> 27:49.950
Well, why not?

27:51.711 --> 27:53.078
Two Polars, honey.

28:00.095 --> 28:01.920
You down at the airport today, Herman?

28:03.223 --> 28:05.542
Yeah, I was.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.545
Somebody broke the finger
off a Hare Krishna

28:08.645 --> 28:10.589
and the son of a bitch died.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.549
No shit?

28:12.649 --> 28:14.474
No shit.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.478
I didn't do it.

28:19.364 --> 28:21.433
Oh, no, no, no,
we're just looking for someone

28:21.533 --> 28:23.643
who might have seen anything.

28:23.743 --> 28:27.279
I'm curious, uh...
you own a suede sport coat?

28:28.123 --> 28:30.191
Yeah, I do.

28:30.291 --> 28:32.444
Okay. You're probably the one.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.738
Did you get on the courtesy van
to the Grand Prix Hotel?

28:34.838 --> 28:37.789
Hey, fuck this nonsense, man.

28:38.675 --> 28:40.994
Hey, you're misunderstanding this,
Herman.

28:41.094 --> 28:42.579
Who got killed?

28:42.679 --> 28:46.374
You know, if I had something better to do
like sit at home with a beautiful girl

28:46.474 --> 28:48.585
I wouldn't even be
bothering you, but, uh...

28:48.685 --> 28:51.129
you were mentioned
as a possible witness.

28:51.229 --> 28:53.263
See anything?

28:54.107 --> 28:55.515
Nope.

29:08.764 --> 29:10.249
We got this forensic dentist.

29:10.349 --> 29:12.942
And I, uh... I talked him
into pulling my teeth

29:13.042 --> 29:14.653
and fixing me some new choppers.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.905
It took two months of his spare time.

29:17.005 --> 29:19.247
And I got so used to drinking
without 'em, I just pull 'em out.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.250
Bother you?

29:25.430 --> 29:27.005
Junior?

29:29.058 --> 29:30.759
You want me to fix those pork chops now?

29:34.230 --> 29:36.306
Hell, I'll put 'em
back in for pork chops.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.059
Pork chops comin' up.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.984
Herman?

29:47.869 --> 29:52.280
Your fiancee
is the best cook in South Florida.

29:53.458 --> 29:54.950
More taters?

30:00.924 --> 30:02.290
Junior?

30:11.768 --> 30:14.386
So, Herman, where'd you do your time?

30:17.774 --> 30:20.600
Time? What do you mean?

30:21.778 --> 30:24.514
Well, the way you're guarding that food.

30:24.614 --> 30:27.232
You know, like another con
could take it away from you.

30:29.786 --> 30:32.029
Well, I was raised
in foster homes, you know?

30:34.082 --> 30:36.283
I didn't get no dessert
till I was in eighth grade.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.362
Damn.

30:39.462 --> 30:41.204
I got a daughter in the eighth grade.

30:42.715 --> 30:46.161
Half my paycheck goes
to her orthodontist.

30:46.261 --> 30:48.128
She's got your teeth, man.

30:56.688 --> 30:58.214
Yeah, the joint's about the only place

30:58.314 --> 31:00.807
you got time to work out
to get a grip like that.

31:06.531 --> 31:09.184
I was an aerobics instructor.

31:09.284 --> 31:12.027
Shoots the shit out of that theory.

31:21.588 --> 31:23.323
Any more Polars?

31:23.423 --> 31:26.576
Oh... Junior got the last one.

31:26.676 --> 31:28.502
I could run out and get some.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.833
Beer's gone, I'm gone.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.425
Aw, you're kidding.

31:39.063 --> 31:41.389
But, you know,
I gotta get that pork chop recipe first.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.678
No. Are you serious?

31:45.778 --> 31:48.056
It is so easy, what I did.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.724
You are definitely
not gonna have to write this down.

31:49.824 --> 31:53.812
All it is is pork chops in a frying pan.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.189
And just cook 'em
in their own fat with a lot of salt.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.698
Oh, well, they sure were good,
but you know what I really like...

31:59.834 --> 32:02.821
is native Florida cooking.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.281
Now, did you ever have
chestnut batter on your pork chops?

32:05.381 --> 32:06.825
Boy, I never did.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.160
You got a recipe for that somewhere?

32:09.260 --> 32:10.703
Uh... yeah, I do, as a matter of fact.

32:10.803 --> 32:12.497
I'll give it to you. Just a minute here.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.165
Oh, I appreciate that.

32:14.265 --> 32:15.632
Great dinner.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.595
Get you something to go, Sarge?

32:21.898 --> 32:23.591
Just you.

32:23.691 --> 32:25.058
Kidding, Herman.

32:26.486 --> 32:30.014
Listen, if you think of anything,
just, uh... give me a call.

32:30.114 --> 32:31.481
That's my home phone.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.187
Look, it's a hotel,
and the old guy at the desk is deaf,

32:36.287 --> 32:39.190
so, uh... just let it ring
till he sees the lights.

32:39.290 --> 32:42.735
Oh, and, uh... when we round up
the usual airport hoodlums,

32:42.835 --> 32:46.865
maybe you could shoot by
and take a look at a line-up.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.331
Take you five minutes.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.722
Oh, yeah.

32:53.822 --> 32:58.376
You mind standing in the line-up, too?
We're a little short of bodies.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.927
You ever stood
in a line-up before, Herman?

33:03.523 --> 33:04.883
Never been caught, Sarge.

33:07.902 --> 33:10.430
Ah, you ain't got one beer rat-holed

33:10.530 --> 33:12.098
I can take with me for the road, do you?

33:12.198 --> 33:14.941
You got it all, man. Dog biscuits, too.

33:16.160 --> 33:17.569
See you.

33:21.207 --> 33:22.741
Night, Susie.

34:30.525 --> 34:34.347
Years ago, I started
preaching catch-and-release.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.641
Back then, a lot of things
seemed to indicate

34:36.741 --> 34:39.393
that our bass resource
in many areas of the country

34:39.494 --> 34:41.437
was rapidly diminishing.

34:41.536 --> 34:43.856
Today, there is no doubt about it,

34:43.956 --> 34:46.359
and I'm very concerned
about what the future holds

34:46.458 --> 34:48.069
for this great sport.

34:48.168 --> 34:52.156
In simple terms we don't have
the vast water we once had

34:52.255 --> 34:55.534
and there are several reasons for it...
pollution, illegal netting,

34:55.635 --> 34:58.121
the pressure of removing
too many adult bass

34:58.221 --> 34:59.539
from their environment.

34:59.639 --> 35:01.381
You know, they're kind
of like money in the bank.

35:09.357 --> 35:14.220
I got news for you.
I'm not coming back. I'm married.

35:14.320 --> 35:17.480
I am so married. I gotta go. Bye.

35:20.493 --> 35:21.860
You like ham and eggs?

35:23.496 --> 35:25.613
Hey! Drop it.

35:29.585 --> 35:31.369
Smells good.

35:32.713 --> 35:36.708
- Who was that, anyway?
- Pablo. The cops rousted him.

35:38.928 --> 35:41.629
I guess they're giving him
a hard time because of you.

35:53.693 --> 35:55.636
We got to go for a little ride, honey.

35:55.736 --> 35:59.015
What? What about breakfast?
It was gonna be a surprise.

35:59.115 --> 36:01.941
I was gonna bring it
in to you on a tray, and then I...

36:03.661 --> 36:05.070
Make it to go.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.074
Okay.

38:02.238 --> 38:04.439
Not too tired for some fun?

38:12.373 --> 38:14.150
Call it a night, sister.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.617
Aye, aye, sir.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.668
I got something that I gotta tell you.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.796
I used to be in prison.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.799
What'd you do to get there?

39:16.145 --> 39:18.596
I used to rob people who robbed people.

39:20.566 --> 39:21.968
Kind of like Robin Hood?

39:22.744 --> 39:23.943
Yeah.

39:25.988 --> 39:28.856
Except I didn't give the money
to the poor people.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.103
Oh.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.196
You don't do that anymore, do you?

39:38.209 --> 39:40.486
I got investments now.

39:40.586 --> 39:43.531
Good. You got me out of the life.

39:43.631 --> 39:45.658
Now you stay out of crime.

39:45.758 --> 39:47.743
Sounds good.

39:47.843 --> 39:49.210
Promise?

39:51.430 --> 39:53.791
Yeah, sure. Why not?

39:53.891 --> 39:55.925
Say you promise.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.441
I promise.

40:13.452 --> 40:16.112
Henderson? Sanchez. Homicide.

40:16.956 --> 40:19.198
- Oh, my replacement.
- How is he?

40:20.042 --> 40:24.238
He's got a cervical disc injury,
a dislocated jaw, bruises,

40:24.338 --> 40:27.248
uh... got a concussion,
I don't know how bad it is.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.453
Somebody really worked him over.

40:30.553 --> 40:32.663
Did he tell you who did it?
What happened?

40:32.763 --> 40:34.964
No, he's in and out of consciousness.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.975
Drop the knife, Pablo.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.977
My name isn't Gotlieb.

40:55.077 --> 40:57.271
Sergeant Hoke Moseley, homicide.

40:57.371 --> 40:59.357
That little girl you sent up to my room?

40:59.457 --> 41:01.317
She's 15 years old, man.

41:01.417 --> 41:04.779
She's 23, man. She's not 15.

41:04.879 --> 41:08.366
Look. Sergeant Lackley checked her I.D.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.993
Why don't you call him?
I pay him every week.

41:11.093 --> 41:12.828
Maybe you two guys can get together.

41:12.928 --> 41:14.580
How much you pay Lackley every week?

41:14.680 --> 41:16.374
$500 a week. Don't.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.167
All right, from now on,
Lackley gets 250.

41:18.267 --> 41:21.337
The other 250 to me at the Primrose Hotel.
You got it, man?

41:21.437 --> 41:24.590
Lackley's not gonna go
for any split like that.

41:24.690 --> 41:27.975
You tell the guy at the desk
to leave it for me in the safe.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.908
Hi. What can I get for you?

41:51.408 --> 41:53.548
- Ice coffee.
- Okay.

41:56.222 --> 41:58.423
Hey! What are you doing?

42:00.267 --> 42:03.553
Open it!
Open the goddamn drawer now! Do it!

42:06.190 --> 42:07.557
Stop or I'll shoot!

42:09.401 --> 42:10.928
You just shot me.

42:11.028 --> 42:13.180
I fired a warning shot, and it hit you.

42:13.280 --> 42:14.981
You're no cop.

42:16.033 --> 42:19.103
No problem. There is no problem.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.814
Police. Homicide.
You people go about your business.

42:21.914 --> 42:24.442
You finish your lunches,
your breakfasts, whatever.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.986
Don't worry, lady,
I'm gonna call an ambulance now

42:27.086 --> 42:29.203
on the radio in my police car.

42:30.422 --> 42:32.373
Yeah. I'll be right back.

42:38.514 --> 42:39.964
Slow down.

42:45.229 --> 42:46.596
Go ahead.

42:52.861 --> 42:54.979
Stop right here!

43:13.257 --> 43:16.709
- Furnished?
- Yeah, with almost antiques.

43:26.145 --> 43:27.678
How much?

43:40.576 --> 43:44.021
I been worried sick!
Where you been all day?!

43:44.121 --> 43:46.155
Dumb question.

43:47.875 --> 43:49.193
Did you get the money?

43:51.295 --> 43:54.532
I cashed in the $10,000 CD,
but I decided to keep

43:54.632 --> 43:56.249
the N.O.W. account open
for eight more days.

43:58.886 --> 44:02.213
What did I tell you? Huh?

44:03.641 --> 44:05.960
They said if I keep it
open for eight more days,

44:06.060 --> 44:08.135
I'll be eligible for a teapot.

44:16.278 --> 44:17.687
I'm sorry.

44:20.491 --> 44:24.026
It's just 8 more days.
You'll still be here, won't you?

44:24.870 --> 44:26.279
I don't know.

44:28.332 --> 44:31.360
My problem is that I can have everything
and anything that I want

44:31.460 --> 44:33.661
but I don't know what I want.

44:38.133 --> 44:40.710
Tell me again about
that Burger World franchise.

44:41.553 --> 44:42.920
Okay.

44:50.187 --> 44:53.257
Okay. You need $50,000.

44:53.357 --> 44:55.509
You borrow another 50,000
from Burger World

44:55.609 --> 44:57.720
and you wait for an opening.

44:57.820 --> 45:00.104
But why? What's the purpose?

45:04.743 --> 45:07.021
To make a living, that's all.

45:07.121 --> 45:09.607
You hire kids
so you can pay 'em nothing.

45:09.707 --> 45:11.900
And you watch 'em real close
or they will steal you blind.

45:12.000 --> 45:16.905
And... and you save your money,
and you buy a nice little house

45:17.005 --> 45:19.373
with a white picket fence.

45:21.760 --> 45:24.795
And you live happily ever after.

45:26.765 --> 45:30.169
I tell you what... let's go straight

45:30.269 --> 45:32.511
to the "happily ever after" part, okay?

45:34.148 --> 45:37.134
I can't see any point in hanging out
at a Burger World

45:37.234 --> 45:39.560
no matter how much money
you're gonna make.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.640
It's stupid.

45:42.740 --> 45:45.643
You can forget
about Burger World, honey.

45:45.743 --> 45:48.402
Okay.

45:59.923 --> 46:03.452
I'm gonna take care of you,
and you're gonna take care of me.

46:03.552 --> 46:05.002
That's our purpose.

46:05.846 --> 46:07.922
Do you know any married people today?

46:09.099 --> 46:11.669
Hmm? They're a team.

46:11.769 --> 46:15.179
They pull together, and they get rich.

46:16.440 --> 46:17.807
They got it all.

46:22.654 --> 46:24.480
And you know that little house
you were just talking about?

46:27.785 --> 46:30.187
I rented us one in Coral Gables today.

46:30.287 --> 46:32.398
Oh, Junior.

46:32.498 --> 46:34.240
That's what you were up to all day?

46:37.461 --> 46:40.705
I'm gonna take such good care of you.

46:49.640 --> 46:52.049
He was a big guy, man. Bigger than you.

46:53.060 --> 46:54.885
Got up from the table,
said he was homicide.

46:55.729 --> 46:57.589
Pulled a badge?

46:57.689 --> 46:59.591
After he whacks the dude.

46:59.691 --> 47:02.893
It was cold, man, ice cold.

47:06.114 --> 47:07.933
Thanks, Blink.

47:08.033 --> 47:10.018
What do I owe you?

47:10.118 --> 47:11.777
It's on the house, bro.

47:59.835 --> 48:01.202
Come on.

48:44.254 --> 48:46.949
I like the air conditioning on "frozen."

48:47.049 --> 48:48.415
Me, too.

49:06.276 --> 49:08.936
- Half-ounce. Primo, man.
- Thanks, man.

49:23.752 --> 49:25.487
Hey, half that's mine.

49:25.587 --> 49:27.364
Fuck you! I sold it. I keep the money.

49:27.464 --> 49:29.032
These are my contacts.
They're my people.

49:29.132 --> 49:30.617
I don't give a shit about your contacts.

49:30.717 --> 49:32.494
Don't turn your back
when I'm talkin' to you.

49:32.594 --> 49:33.912
I'm tired of your shit.
Get out of my face!

49:34.012 --> 49:35.754
Police! Freeze!

49:36.932 --> 49:39.042
Stand over there.

49:39.142 --> 49:41.510
Put that on. Right through there.

49:44.189 --> 49:46.717
You know what to do, Shorty.

49:46.817 --> 49:49.602
- Hey!
- I don't believe this.

49:57.953 --> 50:02.448
I'm gonna let you two guys go...
with a little warning.

50:04.876 --> 50:06.285
- Don't get caught.
- Shit!

50:11.842 --> 50:13.209
Police! Don't move!

50:22.477 --> 50:23.886
You can go now.

50:35.907 --> 50:37.983
Give me your wallet!

50:39.494 --> 50:40.945
Come on, man. Move it

50:41.788 --> 50:43.155
Police! Drop it!

50:44.207 --> 50:45.658
I said drop it.

50:48.628 --> 50:50.287
Shoot him!

50:51.173 --> 50:53.867
Make it, Julio. Comprendo?

50:53.967 --> 50:55.376
Yeah. Yeah.

51:03.185 --> 51:05.261
That's my purse! Stop him!

51:06.855 --> 51:08.764
Stop! Somebody please help me!

51:10.734 --> 51:12.643
Go get him.

51:15.197 --> 51:16.765
Thank you, officer.

51:16.865 --> 51:18.225
Yeah, that's great, lady.

51:18.325 --> 51:20.185
But... you're a cop!

51:20.285 --> 51:23.487
Hey! Police! Police!

51:24.748 --> 51:27.908
You have anything against broccoli,
cauliflower, stuff like that?

51:34.382 --> 51:36.583
I don't want to talk
about that at this time.

51:38.303 --> 51:39.621
Oh.

51:39.721 --> 51:43.041
What are you going to do
now that we're married?

51:43.141 --> 51:47.386
Take care of the house,
shop, fix dinner.

51:50.565 --> 51:52.725
Take care of the babies.

51:54.194 --> 51:56.013
Is that what you'd like to do?

51:56.113 --> 51:58.272
Be a mother?

51:59.407 --> 52:00.941
Well, I don't...

52:02.327 --> 52:05.821
I guess so.
I... I don't... I don't know.

52:07.624 --> 52:10.652
I lived with a girl once for 2 months.

52:10.752 --> 52:13.412
She didn't do anything a housewife
was supposed to do.

52:14.256 --> 52:15.622
I thought you said you were married.

52:17.008 --> 52:18.917
I told you that before
I really knew you.

52:21.263 --> 52:25.132
What I'm driving at, Susie,
is I want to have a regular life.

52:27.060 --> 52:29.087
I want to go to work in the morning,

52:29.187 --> 52:33.925
sometimes at night, come home
to a clean house and a hot meal

52:34.025 --> 52:36.352
and a loving wife just like you.

52:41.116 --> 52:43.108
I don't want to have any babies.

52:45.036 --> 52:47.321
This world's a shit hole.

52:49.457 --> 52:51.658
You think you can handle that?

52:54.713 --> 53:00.834
I do.

53:38.423 --> 53:40.874
It's better than counting money.

54:11.289 --> 54:13.191
These yours?

54:13.291 --> 54:15.159
I can't tell.

54:18.713 --> 54:21.665
Yeah. This, uh... nail polish.

54:22.634 --> 54:25.745
We found two muscle heads
cuffed together.

54:25.845 --> 54:27.831
Jesus! He's making arrests?

54:27.931 --> 54:29.499
We did some routine prints.

54:29.599 --> 54:31.042
They match those taken

54:31.142 --> 54:33.503
from the scene of the dumbbell murders.

54:33.603 --> 54:37.465
I've been working
that case for 15 months.

54:37.565 --> 54:39.558
Congratulations. Case is closed.

54:41.069 --> 54:42.811
Find Gotlieb?

54:43.947 --> 54:46.014
We're looking for him.

54:46.734 --> 54:48.643
Let's get the fuck out of here.

54:48.743 --> 54:50.687
- Okay.
- I'll find him.

54:50.787 --> 54:52.364
Yeah, maybe you should wait
and let him solve

54:52.464 --> 54:55.123
a couple more from your case load, huh?

54:57.293 --> 54:58.904
Will you have a seat, please?

54:59.004 --> 55:02.115
- Where, here?
- Your name, please?

55:02.215 --> 55:04.117
Ziffel. Fred Ziffel.

55:04.217 --> 55:06.036
Is that the way you want
the account to read?

55:06.136 --> 55:08.288
No. I want it to read "Arnold Ziffel."

55:08.388 --> 55:09.796
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

55:12.434 --> 55:13.877
Hey, Eddie.

55:13.977 --> 55:15.462
Here's the key to your new suite.

55:15.562 --> 55:19.806
Oh, and some Cuban kid
on a bicycle made two deliveries.

55:22.944 --> 55:25.263
Uh... 250 in both.

55:25.363 --> 55:27.057
I'm sorry. I opened them.

55:27.157 --> 55:29.483
It's okay, Eddie.

55:30.994 --> 55:33.862
- Thanks.
- Uh-huh.

55:54.309 --> 55:57.052
- Who is it?
- Lackley. Vice.

55:58.521 --> 56:00.674
Slide your I.D. under the door.

56:00.774 --> 56:03.176
- Are you fucking serious?
- Try me!

56:03.276 --> 56:05.727
Next thing you hear will be a bullet
coming through the door!

56:30.762 --> 56:33.248
Pablo sent this.

56:33.348 --> 56:35.625
- What?
- What's the matter, Sarge?

56:35.725 --> 56:37.752
Got a guilty conscience?

56:37.852 --> 56:40.797
I just got out of the hospital.

56:40.897 --> 56:43.265
I know. I know all about you.

56:44.526 --> 56:47.137
I like your place here, too.
It's very nice.

56:47.237 --> 56:50.515
You also got a little something
that belongs to me, don't you, Gums?

56:50.615 --> 56:53.852
What the fuck you talking about?
Never seen you before in my life.

56:53.952 --> 56:58.106
Now, listen, Sarge you think
you're moving in on my territory?

56:58.206 --> 57:00.567
I think you better cough up
some "do-re-mi" right now.

57:00.667 --> 57:02.402
500 bucks. Let's have it.

57:03.237 --> 57:05.655
What 500 bucks?
What are you talking about?

57:05.755 --> 57:08.033
- Fuck off!
- Fuck off?! Fuck off?!

57:08.133 --> 57:10.994
You go to Pablo,
you cut yourself in on my action.

57:11.094 --> 57:12.711
You don't think I'm coming after you?

57:13.555 --> 57:16.089
Jesus Christ! You got a lot of balls!

57:21.312 --> 57:23.590
And Pablo wants the hooker
back on the job

57:23.690 --> 57:26.343
tomorrow at 10:00,
and all is forgiven, Gums.

57:26.443 --> 57:27.976
What hooker?

57:30.321 --> 57:31.855
10:00.

57:34.325 --> 57:37.771
He got your gun and your badge...

57:37.871 --> 57:39.655
and your teeth?

57:41.791 --> 57:44.284
You are a disgrace to the police force.

57:54.721 --> 57:58.507
Fucking Junior "Bullshit" Gotlieb.

58:14.365 --> 58:17.560
- Hey, you got a piece, Eddie?
- Teeth?

58:17.660 --> 58:21.655
- No. A gun. A gun. I need it.
- Hold on.

58:35.678 --> 58:37.713
Hair trigger.

58:38.848 --> 58:40.215
Hollow points.

58:43.269 --> 58:44.636
Thanks, Eddie.

59:44.205 --> 59:46.364
Where's Antonio?

01:00:09.897 --> 01:00:11.556
On your feet, pal.

01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:16.394
Turn around.

01:00:17.238 --> 01:00:18.647
Move it!

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:24.896
Police raid! Everybody freeze!

01:00:24.996 --> 01:00:26.314
Run for it!

01:00:26.814 --> 01:00:28.024
Yo! Hey, guys!

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:31.694
Come on back. Where are you goin'?
Come on. I got this covered!

01:00:31.794 --> 01:00:33.112
At ease, officer.

01:00:33.212 --> 01:00:36.039
I think you'd better
check with your superiors.

01:00:38.092 --> 01:00:39.709
Remain silent.

01:00:41.804 --> 01:00:44.422
Hey, I pay good money
to the right people, huh?

01:00:50.647 --> 01:00:52.423
Were you out at the airport today?

01:00:52.523 --> 01:00:55.642
Was I out at the airport today?
What, are you crazy?

01:00:56.486 --> 01:00:59.931
- You ever stood in a line-up before?
- Oh, yeah. I stood in a line-up before.

01:01:00.031 --> 01:01:01.391
Okay, I want you to line up there!

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.059
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:04.526
Shut up!!

01:01:09.715 --> 01:01:12.087
You own a suede sports coat?

01:01:12.877 --> 01:01:14.244
Courtesy van?

01:01:15.129 --> 01:01:17.031
You ain't no cop.

01:01:17.131 --> 01:01:18.616
Oh, I'm a cop.

01:01:18.716 --> 01:01:20.159
Prove it, slick.

01:01:20.259 --> 01:01:22.168
You're not walking... agh!

01:01:25.848 --> 01:01:28.418
You crazy son of a bitch!

01:01:28.518 --> 01:01:29.926
I'll kick the living shit...

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.139
Hey, Scanlan.

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.226
Hey.

01:01:40.071 --> 01:01:41.563
Hey, Smiley. How are you?

01:01:44.033 --> 01:01:45.643
Ellita Sanchez?

01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:48.104
Hoke Moseley.

01:01:48.204 --> 01:01:49.522
I've been calling you.

01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:51.566
Don't they have someone
at that desk to answer?

01:01:51.666 --> 01:01:56.119
Yeah. But he's deaf. Got something?

01:01:58.256 --> 01:02:00.457
Prints I.D. on those beer bottles.

01:02:04.804 --> 01:02:06.713
That's the son of a bitch!

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:15.590
"Frederick J. Frenger, Junior."

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.051
Junior Gotlieb.
I knew that was bullshit.

01:02:18.151 --> 01:02:20.678
I got something on the real Gotlieb.

01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:23.890
Mugged, DOA at
the San Francisco Airport Hospital.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:26.059
Sound like Junior's MO?

01:02:26.159 --> 01:02:27.477
Murder one.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.063
We can nail him as
the Krishna finger killer, I bet.

01:02:31.192 --> 01:02:33.395
He's grown up behind bars.

01:02:33.495 --> 01:02:35.234
And look at this.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:37.403
Someone charged a suede sport coat

01:02:37.503 --> 01:02:40.789
on the real Gotlieb's credit card
after he was dead.

01:02:42.508 --> 01:02:44.535
We got the motherfucker!

01:02:44.635 --> 01:02:46.211
Thanks.

01:02:47.305 --> 01:02:49.123
I'm sorry. Habit.

01:02:49.223 --> 01:02:52.001
I ran his real name by the utilities,
but it turned up nothing.

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.670
He wouldn't use his real name.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:56.255
Well, if he did, we'd be knocking
on his door right now.

01:02:56.355 --> 01:02:57.715
What about Waggoner?

01:02:57.815 --> 01:03:01.010
I called every utility in Dade.
Even bottled water.

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.645
I'm sitting here having my lunch
waiting for a call back, okay?

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:05.855
Sitting on your lunch?

01:03:08.451 --> 01:03:09.943
Try Broward.

01:03:19.086 --> 01:03:22.323
Look, I know you think
I'm a weak suck, but I don't care.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:25.618
The guy who did this to me,
this Frenger, Junior,

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:28.454
he's got my old badge, Sanchez.

01:03:28.554 --> 01:03:30.880
He's running around playing cop
assaulting and beating people.

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:34.676
I'm doing everything I can to help.

01:03:38.189 --> 01:03:39.848
Call me if you hear anything.

01:04:21.482 --> 01:04:22.974
Put the funny book down!

01:04:24.151 --> 01:04:26.770
Give me the fuckin' cash
or I'll blow your fuckin' head off!

01:04:29.574 --> 01:04:31.434
Come on, don't count it, God damn it!

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:35.028
Police! Drop the gun, son.

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:40.283
I know what it's like to be
on the other end of that gun.

01:04:42.211 --> 01:04:43.953
You're making a big mistake.

01:04:44.797 --> 01:04:46.908
I tell you what.

01:04:47.008 --> 01:04:53.296
You put down the gun, give back the money
and I'll let you walk on out of here.

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.469
You walk out that door
your life is gonna change forever.

01:05:06.694 --> 01:05:08.686
Hold your fire, you asshole!

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:15.985
What the fuck?!

01:05:36.182 --> 01:05:37.917
Hey.

01:05:38.017 --> 01:05:41.177
Hey, you okay? Hey, mister.

01:05:43.731 --> 01:05:46.015
Get this thing off me. I'm a cop.

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.646
I think I hit him.

01:05:58.746 --> 01:06:00.697
You didn't hit shit.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.654
Where is the whipping cream?

01:06:06.754 --> 01:06:08.246
We're out.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.141
Oh, my God.

01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:31.721
Okay, I want you to do something for me.

01:06:31.821 --> 01:06:34.682
Go get me some cotton balls... aah!

01:06:34.782 --> 01:06:36.149
Some peroxide...

01:06:37.994 --> 01:06:40.778
some bandages,
and bring me a small mirror!

01:06:44.750 --> 01:06:47.452
Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:06:48.337 --> 01:06:50.948
Oh, fuck me. Okay.

01:06:55.052 --> 01:06:57.455
Okay. Okay.

01:06:57.555 --> 01:07:00.750
I want you to go and get me
your smallest needle,

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.676
a small needle and thread it
with black thread, okay?

01:07:13.487 --> 01:07:15.306
Here. I got it.
I got it. I got it. I got it.

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:19.310
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:23.272
Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Oh, God.

01:07:23.372 --> 01:07:26.908
Okay, Now I tell you what...

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:31.364
I want you to sew my eyebrow back on.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:32.830
Okay?

01:07:33.799 --> 01:07:35.660
Hey, hey! Now, come on, come on.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.745
Come on. You're gonna be okay. I got it.

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:39.212
I'm sorry. I'm no good at this.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:41.965
I got it.

01:07:46.270 --> 01:07:48.589
What? Okay. Okay.

01:07:48.689 --> 01:07:51.683
I got you. I'm gonna get you a doctor.

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:54.936
Oh, no. No doctors. No... no doctors.

01:07:57.823 --> 01:07:59.565
I want you to get me a bottle of gin.

01:08:00.451 --> 01:08:04.230
I nursed my husband
for 3 years before he died

01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.030
but you're not going to die.

01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:09.867
Here.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:12.078
- It's gin, Junior.
- Drink it.

01:08:20.386 --> 01:08:22.212
We're gonna need this.

01:08:23.515 --> 01:08:25.501
This is going to hurt.

01:08:27.978 --> 01:08:30.631
You move and you're a blind man.
Scissors.

01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:32.223
Okay. Okay.

01:08:37.696 --> 01:08:40.106
Hold it. Hold it.

01:08:44.995 --> 01:08:47.356
You're doing real good, Junior.

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:49.399
I'm just gonna move down a bit.

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:53.786
Now we just have one more. Just hold on.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.807
That'll hold you.

01:09:15.734 --> 01:09:18.185
Your husband must have been glad to die.

01:09:22.533 --> 01:09:23.850
Thank you.

01:09:23.951 --> 01:09:26.903
Yeah, thanks.
You got a real nice touch there, lady.

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:42.703
So are you gonna tell me about it?

01:09:42.803 --> 01:09:45.247
Yeah, I'll tell you about it.

01:09:45.346 --> 01:09:47.792
This straight life
that we've been living

01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:50.252
has been giving me this
misplaced sense of security!

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:54.931
I thought for one minute there I was some
kind of fuckin' solid citizen or something.

01:09:57.651 --> 01:10:00.895
All I want to know
is what happened to you.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:08.111
Some guy in a blue
Toyota pickup ran me over.

01:10:09.413 --> 01:10:11.489
I thought it must have been
something like that.

01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:18.697
An anonymous,
apparently off-duty police officer

01:10:18.797 --> 01:10:21.909
interrupted a robbery tonight
at a Coral Gables convenience store,

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:24.203
heroically confronting an armed robber

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.580
with only bottles of spaghetti sauce.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.516
The officer then left the scene of the crime

01:10:28.616 --> 01:10:31.884
without identifying himself.
Police speculate that it...

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:40.970
Yeah?!

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:42.812
Ellita Sanchez.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.871
Come in.

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:08.914
What's this?

01:11:09.014 --> 01:11:13.092
Susan Waggoner, telephone order.
There's an address in the Gables.

01:11:15.729 --> 01:11:17.096
The Gables.

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:21.927
- What time is it?
- It's 1:00.

01:11:22.027 --> 01:11:23.846
I was going out on a date.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.264
I've got a relative with Southern Bell

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:26.682
or we wouldn't have gotten
the number for days.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.232
That's great. Thanks.

01:11:29.535 --> 01:11:31.068
What are you going to do?

01:11:32.705 --> 01:11:34.113
I'm gonna check it out.

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:40.745
Sanchez? Thanks.

01:11:59.940 --> 01:12:03.093
Out of all the boys in the world

01:12:03.193 --> 01:12:06.639
I choose you again...

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:08.648
You feeling better?

01:12:13.829 --> 01:12:15.814
What would you like for breakfast?

01:12:15.914 --> 01:12:18.859
I carefully consider

01:12:18.959 --> 01:12:22.571
every choice and then

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:26.116
- Out of all the boys in the world
- You're not hungry?

01:12:26.216 --> 01:12:29.411
I'd choose you again...

01:12:29.511 --> 01:12:32.547
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
run some errands and then I'll be back.

01:12:33.599 --> 01:12:37.628
I'd choose you

01:12:37.728 --> 01:12:40.714
If God gave me the chance

01:12:40.814 --> 01:12:42.925
To do it all again...

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:45.219
I love you.

01:12:45.319 --> 01:12:47.603
Oh, I'd carefully consider...

01:14:01.687 --> 01:14:03.047
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:06.925
Hey! Susan, uh... Waggoner, right?

01:14:07.025 --> 01:14:08.559
- Remember me?
- No, sir.

01:14:09.403 --> 01:14:11.937
Hoke "Pork Chops" Moseley.

01:14:13.866 --> 01:14:16.185
God, what happened to you?

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.771
Ah, some psycho jumped me,

01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:20.522
almost broke my neck,

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:23.609
stole my gun, my badge, and my teeth.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:26.077
- Teeth?
- Yeah. These are temps.

01:14:26.920 --> 01:14:28.947
Hey, I got something for you.

01:14:29.047 --> 01:14:30.616
Do you do your marketing here?

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:32.284
Excuse me, would you
like to try some sausage?

01:14:32.384 --> 01:14:34.912
- No, thank you.
- Are you sure? It's really good.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:36.379
Remember that...

01:14:38.056 --> 01:14:41.001
pork chop recipe I promised you

01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:42.468
with the chestnut batter?

01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:46.298
Glad I ran into you.

01:14:46.398 --> 01:14:48.467
Oh, this is great.

01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:50.302
I can't believe you remembered.

01:14:50.402 --> 01:14:51.720
That is so nice of you.

01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:54.431
I'm gonna put it on my list,
and I'm gonna make it tonight.

01:14:54.531 --> 01:14:57.483
Hey, is that an invitation?
I'll be there.

01:14:58.577 --> 01:14:59.944
Oh.

01:15:00.787 --> 01:15:03.072
I got class tonight. I'm sorry.

01:15:05.542 --> 01:15:06.902
You're still with that guy, huh?

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:09.829
No. Um... I kicked him out.

01:15:10.672 --> 01:15:14.159
Well, good for you.

01:15:14.259 --> 01:15:16.412
You know who he really is?

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:17.830
He's a murderer.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:20.541
Herman Gotlieb isn't even his real name.

01:15:20.641 --> 01:15:22.209
He spent his life in prison.

01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:25.754
Frederick J. Frenger, Junior.

01:15:25.854 --> 01:15:27.840
Junior.

01:15:27.940 --> 01:15:29.258
Yeah.

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:32.261
Hate to run into Senior.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:36.223
Oh... hey, you ever made vinegar pie?

01:15:37.275 --> 01:15:39.810
Vinegar pie? My mother used to make it.

01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:41.395
I can still taste it.

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.897
Oh. Seedless raisins for a start.

01:15:43.997 --> 01:15:46.108
Chop 'em up real fine.

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.819
And you beat the egg yolks
and the butter until they're creamy

01:15:48.919 --> 01:15:50.446
Wait a second.

01:15:50.546 --> 01:15:53.323
And you beat the egg whites
until they're stiff,

01:15:53.423 --> 01:15:57.744
and then you fold them in,
and you take one cup of sugar.

01:15:57.844 --> 01:16:00.664
And, um... here's the tricky part, okay?

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:02.082
This is the key.

01:16:02.182 --> 01:16:05.002
You use 5% vinegar, no stronger.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:07.337
And just three teaspoons, that's all.

01:16:07.437 --> 01:16:09.506
Just three little teaspoons.

01:16:09.606 --> 01:16:12.676
That's where Mama went wrong.

01:16:12.776 --> 01:16:15.436
Yeah, probably so.

01:16:16.989 --> 01:16:21.108
You don't know where I could find
that old boyfriend of yours, do you?

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:25.362
No. He's gone for good.

01:16:26.582 --> 01:16:28.650
I know you wouldn't lie for him.

01:16:28.750 --> 01:16:30.618
He was the liar.

01:16:31.962 --> 01:16:34.448
Well, uh... enjoy that recipe.

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:35.908
I will.

01:16:36.008 --> 01:16:37.374
Look, my number's on it.

01:16:38.218 --> 01:16:40.920
If you really like it, give me a call.

01:16:45.767 --> 01:16:47.384
Oh, my God.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.267
One.

01:16:58.196 --> 01:16:59.563
Two.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.210
Three.

01:17:44.117 --> 01:17:45.602
What are you doing tomorrow?

01:17:45.702 --> 01:17:47.695
I was gonna paint the security bars.

01:17:48.538 --> 01:17:53.026
Oh, no, I got a million errands
I gotta run tomorrow.

01:17:53.126 --> 01:17:55.988
I wanted to go in
and cash in my coin collection.

01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:58.956
I need you to drive me around some.
We'll be done by noon.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:01.285
Can't you drive?

01:18:01.385 --> 01:18:03.704
Oh, no way, honey.

01:18:03.804 --> 01:18:05.539
Honey, I gotta...

01:18:05.639 --> 01:18:09.334
I'm gonna be hopping in and out
of a hundred different places.

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:12.595
Cost me a fortune just to park
if I could find a place.

01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:16.348
That dessert?

01:18:17.693 --> 01:18:19.727
I'll bring it to you. Just go sit down.

01:19:04.614 --> 01:19:06.565
So, you gonna drive me around tomorrow?

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.770
Junior, are you sure
this is just an errand?

01:19:09.870 --> 01:19:12.112
You promised no more illegal stuff.

01:19:14.958 --> 01:19:18.077
You saved my life, Susie.

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.366
Would I fuck up the best thing
that ever happened to me

01:19:22.466 --> 01:19:25.000
just to make you
some kind of a wheelman?

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:28.462
Would you?

01:19:31.224 --> 01:19:33.050
We made a deal.

01:19:33.894 --> 01:19:36.053
I promised.

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:48.649
Like it?

01:19:50.243 --> 01:19:51.819
This is really great.

01:19:55.457 --> 01:19:57.574
It's great!

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:01.036
Great.

01:20:03.381 --> 01:20:05.290
One of your best.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:46.551
If a cop should come by and hassle you,
then you just drive on around the block.

01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:48.887
Why would anyone hassle me?

01:21:48.987 --> 01:21:51.181
You parked in a yellow zone.

01:21:51.281 --> 01:21:52.856
Oh.

01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:20.134
Police officer. Buzz me in.

01:23:00.475 --> 01:23:02.752
You say these coins
are stolen, Sergeant?

01:23:02.852 --> 01:23:05.005
Sergeant, uh

01:23:05.105 --> 01:23:06.590
Moseley.

01:23:06.690 --> 01:23:08.466
Homicide.

01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:10.594
We picked him up on a fencing sting.

01:23:10.694 --> 01:23:14.271
We figure if we could get a line
on the owners, we could solve the crime.

01:23:16.032 --> 01:23:18.143
This a valuable collection or what?

01:23:18.243 --> 01:23:20.736
This is by no means a rare collection.

01:23:22.372 --> 01:23:25.150
When I take

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:29.029
this fleeting breath

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:32.699
When my eyes,

01:23:32.799 --> 01:23:36.251
they'll close in death

01:23:42.642 --> 01:23:44.920
Just a cursory look at these coins

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:46.880
tells me they're in fair condition.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:49.466
That was cursory?

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:51.509
You ever seen them before?

01:23:51.609 --> 01:23:54.512
Seen lots like them.

01:23:54.612 --> 01:23:56.556
What happened to your eye?

01:23:56.656 --> 01:23:58.683
Car accident.

01:23:58.783 --> 01:24:01.478
You should sue the doctor
who sewed you up.

01:24:01.578 --> 01:24:02.896
You could make a bundle.

01:24:02.996 --> 01:24:05.565
He said it'd be fine
after it scarred over.

01:24:05.665 --> 01:24:07.651
He lied.

01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:10.487
How come a homicide detective

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:13.573
is so interested in stolen property?

01:24:13.673 --> 01:24:17.577
First of all, that's
confidential information.

01:24:17.677 --> 01:24:21.665
Second of all, I'll ask all
the questions around here.

01:24:21.765 --> 01:24:23.541
I'm working on a tip.

01:24:23.641 --> 01:24:25.669
I'm thinking of putting
a stakeout in here.

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:28.630
You know, before I put that window in

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.590
I was hit three times in one month,

01:24:30.690 --> 01:24:33.009
but I don't need no stakeout now.

01:24:33.109 --> 01:24:34.886
Yeah? Why's that?

01:24:34.986 --> 01:24:37.437
Because of Pedro. Pedro!

01:24:41.242 --> 01:24:43.186
He's been watching you the whole time

01:24:43.286 --> 01:24:44.771
through a peephole in the door.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:47.524
It's okay, Pedro.

01:24:47.624 --> 01:24:51.576
This is Sergeant Moseley.
He's with the police department.

01:24:56.591 --> 01:24:57.958
Pedro!

01:25:03.740 --> 01:25:05.532
You bitch!

01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:41.793
Oh, God.

01:26:12.041 --> 01:26:13.777
You promised!

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:16.036
What the fuck are you doing?!

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:23.835
- Freeze! Police!
- Freeze! Police!

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.049
Hold it!

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:39.559
Hey, move it!

01:26:57.128 --> 01:26:59.072
Stop! Police!

01:26:59.172 --> 01:27:00.956
Not again! No!

01:27:02.300 --> 01:27:03.875
Get out of the car!

01:27:05.511 --> 01:27:06.878
Shit.

01:28:17.583 --> 01:28:18.943
What happened to you?

01:28:19.043 --> 01:28:21.946
Raise your hands level
with your shoulders.

01:28:22.046 --> 01:28:25.742
What are you gonna do if I don't, Sarge?

01:28:25.842 --> 01:28:27.160
Shoot me?

01:28:27.260 --> 01:28:31.963
What was the bullshit with the money
you left me, Frederick?

01:28:37.020 --> 01:28:38.880
I don't give nothing away.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.097
What did the Krishna do to die?

01:28:41.941 --> 01:28:43.384
Where did you get that jacket?

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:45.060
Herman Gotlieb.

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.728
Stand up. Back up slowly.

01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:55.146
Turn around and face the wall.

01:28:55.246 --> 01:28:58.782
I don't think I can do that.
I'll pass out.

01:29:00.043 --> 01:29:01.778
Most of my fingers have been cut off,

01:29:01.878 --> 01:29:03.863
and I'll probably go into
shock any minute now.

01:29:03.963 --> 01:29:05.169
Move it!

01:29:11.137 --> 01:29:15.924
Everything's turning
all orange and silver.

01:29:41.125 --> 01:29:43.451
Susie's gonna get you, Sarge.

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:17.288
Did you kill him?

01:31:17.388 --> 01:31:18.755
Yes.

01:31:29.358 --> 01:31:30.725
Good-bye, Junior.

01:31:34.405 --> 01:31:36.731
You don't have to answer
if you don't want to, but, uh...

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:39.943
gotta clear a few things up.

01:31:43.039 --> 01:31:44.948
Did you know Junior
was gonna rob the store?

01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:48.653
I was hoping he wouldn't.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:50.620
He swore to me.

01:31:51.506 --> 01:31:53.825
I had to give him
the benefit of the doubt

01:31:53.925 --> 01:31:56.000
because he had some good qualities.

01:31:57.094 --> 01:31:59.671
He always ate everything
I ever cooked for him.

01:32:01.974 --> 01:32:03.633
And he never hit me.

01:32:08.189 --> 01:32:10.348
There were lots of good
things about Junior.

01:32:12.151 --> 01:32:15.721
Listen, Hoke, this is exactly what happened
or you're in big jurisdictional trouble.

01:32:15.821 --> 01:32:18.349
You were tailing him, a murder suspect.

01:32:18.449 --> 01:32:21.060
You see him coming out of the coin shop
with a gun in his hand.

01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:22.937
Suspecting him of robbery,
you called for back-up

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:24.355
and you followed him to the house.

01:32:24.455 --> 01:32:26.399
He pulled a gun on you,
and you shot him.

01:32:26.499 --> 01:32:28.867
- Something like that.
- Exactly like that.

01:32:29.710 --> 01:32:32.321
There's only one problem,
though... the girl.

01:32:32.421 --> 01:32:34.449
She'll blow holes in this story.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.082
Cut her loose.

01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:42.206
Is she really Princess Not-So-Bright
or is she just pretending?

01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:44.549
Ah, she's been through hell.
Leave her alone.

01:32:50.106 --> 01:32:51.890
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:32:53.150 --> 01:32:54.719
You look different.

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:56.596
Got my teeth back.

01:33:23.806 --> 01:33:27.335
When I die and they lay me to rest

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:31.297
Gonna go to the place that's the best

01:33:31.397 --> 01:33:34.050
When I lay me down to die

01:33:34.150 --> 01:33:38.679
Goin' up to the spirit in the sky

01:33:38.779 --> 01:33:42.433
- Goin' up to the spirit in the sky
- Spirit in the sky

01:33:42.533 --> 01:33:46.187
- It's where I'm gonna go when I die
- When I die

01:33:46.287 --> 01:33:49.106
When I die and they lay me to rest

01:33:49.206 --> 01:33:53.576
I'm gonna go
to the place that's the best

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:12.129
Prepare yourself, you know it's a must

01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:16.133
Gotta have a friend in Jesus

01:34:16.233 --> 01:34:19.595
So you know that when you die

01:34:19.695 --> 01:34:23.474
He's gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky

01:34:23.574 --> 01:34:27.353
Gonna recommend you
to the spirit in the sky

01:34:27.453 --> 01:34:31.190
- That's where you're gonna go when you die
- When you die

01:34:31.290 --> 01:34:34.068
When you die and they lay you to rest

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:38.496
You're gonna go to the place
that's the best

01:35:23.008 --> 01:35:26.704
Never been a sinner, I never sinned

01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:30.875
I got a friend in Jesus

01:35:30.975 --> 01:35:33.919
So you know that when I die

01:35:34.019 --> 01:35:37.923
He's gonna set me up
with the spirit in the sky

01:35:38.023 --> 01:35:41.802
- Oh, set me up with the spirit in the sky
- Spirit in the sky

01:35:41.902 --> 01:35:45.723
- That's where I'm gonna go when I die
- When I die

01:35:45.823 --> 01:35:48.476
When I die and they lay me to rest

01:35:48.576 --> 01:35:52.403
I'm gonna go to the place
that's the best

01:35:52.455 --> 01:35:57.033
Go to the place that's the best.
