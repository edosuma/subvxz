WEBVTT

00:10.310 --> 00:12.478
- Is it a heart attack?
- No, he's got a pulse. He's good.

00:12.502 --> 00:13.627
The hell happened here?

00:13.836 --> 00:16.224
Oh, all right! Good
morning. There it is.

00:16.305 --> 00:17.805
Is that a flashlight on his dong?

00:17.836 --> 00:19.436
He put his penis where the batteries go?

00:19.534 --> 00:21.670
Is's not a flashlight.
It's a fleshlight.

00:23.408 --> 00:24.750
A sex toy.

00:26.093 --> 00:27.458
Breezy Canyon model.

00:28.168 --> 00:29.495
- Breezy Canyon the porn star.
- Wait,

00:29.519 --> 00:31.685
there's a replica of
her vagina in there?

00:31.687 --> 00:33.521
Yes. The celebrity makes the mold,

00:33.727 --> 00:35.085
they put it in the fleshlight,

00:35.258 --> 00:36.444
and that fella mates with it.

00:36.526 --> 00:37.770
Wait, but what happened, Cap?

00:37.860 --> 00:38.993
The fleshlight knock him out,

00:38.995 --> 00:40.395
or did something happen afterwards?

00:40.596 --> 00:41.916
And what's this all on the walls?

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074

00:50.206 --> 00:51.435
It's elementary, really.

00:51.741 --> 00:53.390
It's dulce de leche.

00:53.776 --> 00:56.110
You boil a can of condensed
milk, it turns into caramel.

00:56.112 --> 00:58.412
Our friend here turned on the
stove, put the can in the water,

00:58.414 --> 01:01.215
and he downed a cafe
boost-a-mente double espresso

01:01.217 --> 01:02.917
to activate the Ambi-snooze sex

01:02.919 --> 01:04.584
he was about to throw
into Breezy Canyon.

01:04.610 --> 01:05.647
What kind of sex?

01:05.672 --> 01:07.721
You take Ambi-snooze then caffeine,

01:07.723 --> 01:10.835
then you fight through the
loginess for a monster orgasm.

01:10.860 --> 01:12.796
- Check his pockets.
- Whoa!

01:12.929 --> 01:15.062
Most likely he miscalculated
the Ambi-snooze

01:15.064 --> 01:16.864
to caffeine ratio, and when it came time

01:16.866 --> 01:19.266
to get cozy with Miss
Breezy, it was lights out.

01:19.318 --> 01:21.921
When the water on the stove
evaporated, the can kept cooking,

01:22.071 --> 01:24.810
and then pow, splattered
caramel all over the walls.

01:26.509 --> 01:27.627
Oh, don't eat that.

01:27.710 --> 01:29.286
Mmm. So sweet.

01:29.512 --> 01:32.298
He should be waking
up in three, two, one.

01:33.149 --> 01:34.371
Whoa!

01:34.484 --> 01:36.150
Hey, Cap, what the hell?!

01:36.196 --> 01:38.252
Man, you got mad deductive skills, Cap.

01:38.277 --> 01:39.327
Eh, what are you gonna do?

01:39.352 --> 01:40.967
- Hey, sir, you okay?
- No judgment.

01:40.992 --> 01:42.030
Get you unstuck, all right?

01:42.055 --> 01:44.164
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, come here! Don't...

01:45.496 --> 01:46.496
Weird.

01:46.696 --> 01:48.616
Prepare yourselves.
It's a full moon out tonight.

01:50.733 --> 01:52.148
Shit's about to get sticky.

02:16.492 --> 02:17.758
All right, all right, all right.

02:17.760 --> 02:19.159
Happy full moon, everybody.

02:19.161 --> 02:20.261
Hope you're ready for a fun night

02:20.263 --> 02:22.604
with the maniacal,
deranged, and disturbed.

02:22.732 --> 02:24.723
Chief, it's a super blue blood moon.

02:24.901 --> 02:26.267
- What's that?
- Well, a blue moon

02:26.269 --> 02:27.669
is the second full moon in a month,

02:27.870 --> 02:30.517
and a blood moon is a lunar
eclipse with a dark-red hue.

02:30.773 --> 02:33.161
And a supermoon is a full moon

02:33.242 --> 02:35.219
with the moon's closest orbit to Earth.

02:35.745 --> 02:37.811
We got our own Neil
Grassy Tyson in the house.

02:37.813 --> 02:39.271
Why? 'Cause I'm black?

02:39.749 --> 02:41.432
It's just the only scientist I know.

02:41.651 --> 02:43.410
- Neil Armstrong, by the way.
- Oh.

02:43.586 --> 02:45.719
Now, you see, the last time
that this super blue blood moon

02:45.721 --> 02:49.632
hit was 1888, and that
night, Jack the Ripper struck.

02:49.675 --> 02:50.680
Hmm.

02:50.705 --> 02:53.404
Van Gogh cut off his ear,
and the Johnstown Flood

02:53.429 --> 02:56.036
wiped out the entire town
of Johnstown, Pennsylvania.

02:57.333 --> 02:58.982
So look the... out.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.769
- This full moon thing is bullshit.
- Oh, is it?

03:01.835 --> 03:03.835
It's always triple the
calls and they're all weird.

03:03.973 --> 03:06.184
So tonight I've called
in reinforcements.

03:06.342 --> 03:07.808
We're being joined by Gene Ghoulib.

03:07.810 --> 03:11.378
Ghooooooooul!

03:11.600 --> 03:12.600
Ghoul.

03:12.719 --> 03:13.761
I take it he's good?

03:13.916 --> 03:15.956
He's a volunteer so he's
free, and he's a great guy.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.335
Okay, stay safe tonight, everybody.

03:24.994 --> 03:26.216
Hey, how are ya?

03:26.306 --> 03:28.887
Volunteer firefighter Gene
Ghoulib reporting for duty.

03:29.065 --> 03:30.071
You can call me Ghoul.

03:30.132 --> 03:32.299
- Okay. Ghoul.
- And you must Lucy.

03:32.370 --> 03:34.600
Congratulations on being the
first woman at the station.

03:34.670 --> 03:36.593
- Where are the fellas?
- They're back there.

03:36.916 --> 03:38.550
Yeah, you know, just paving the way.

03:38.975 --> 03:41.308
Well, actually, it was Jeanette
Woldseth who paved the way.

03:41.310 --> 03:43.410
She was the first
full-time female firefighter

03:43.412 --> 03:44.591
in Washington State history.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.326
Hired in 1977, retired
a captain in 2002.

03:48.351 --> 03:50.862
- What do you think of that?
- Well, aren't you woke AF?

03:50.886 --> 03:52.152
There he is! Ghouly!

03:52.398 --> 03:54.285
How are ya, Chief? Honored to be here.

03:54.310 --> 03:56.380
- Good to have you.
- Ghoul!

03:56.405 --> 03:57.738
Hey!

03:57.927 --> 03:59.071
How are ya, Captain?

03:59.161 --> 04:00.785
Paramedic Smith, good to see you guys.

04:00.997 --> 04:03.398
- You ready for some full moon fever?
- Ready as we'll ever be.

04:03.422 --> 04:07.175
Which I'm guessing is very ready.

04:15.811 --> 04:17.890
<i>Rescue 42... 643, West Fuller.</i>

04:18.414 --> 04:19.834
Wheels up, Granny.
Let's go have some fun.

04:19.858 --> 04:21.093
- Let's do it.
- Take it easy, Ghouly.

04:21.117 --> 04:22.426
- Can I join?
- No, they got it,

04:22.451 --> 04:23.552
they got it. Stay here.

04:23.577 --> 04:25.577
Hey, don't worry, there'll
be plenty to do tonight.

04:25.621 --> 04:26.851
Full moon, probie.

04:27.894 --> 04:30.691
<i>Engine 24... Kudlow Park, open burn.</i>

04:30.693 --> 04:33.708
Ghooooul!

04:33.863 --> 04:36.530
City's saved now, buddy! Ghouly!

04:36.532 --> 04:39.100
Yeah! Ow!

04:39.268 --> 04:41.869
Hey, guys, remember, all open 
burns must have a permit

04:41.871 --> 04:43.939
in accordance with state
and federal regulations.

04:44.006 --> 04:45.873
- You know it, Ghoul!
- You got it, Ghoul!

04:45.875 --> 04:47.451
Lucy, no. You stay with Ghoul.

04:48.210 --> 04:49.428
Full moon fever!

04:49.612 --> 04:50.812
The super blue blood moon.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.158
A blue moon is the second
full moon of the month.

04:53.182 --> 04:54.948
And a blood moon, well,
that's just a lunar eclipse

04:54.950 --> 04:56.484
with a slightly burnt sienna hue.

04:56.519 --> 04:58.852
You guys are all starting
to sound like astrologers

04:58.854 --> 05:00.220
- or something.
- Astronomers.

05:00.222 --> 05:02.028
- Oh, yeah.
- Or astrologers.

05:02.211 --> 05:04.888
Hmm. At least we know
what's in our future.

05:06.873 --> 05:07.905
Wow.

05:07.930 --> 05:11.278
Oh, I hate full-moon nights, man.

05:11.478 --> 05:13.112
What? Full-moon nights are the best.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.779
Second only to The Purge.

05:15.004 --> 05:16.961
You get the dumbest
calls. You know what?

05:17.173 --> 05:18.525
You realize nights like tonight,

05:18.641 --> 05:20.318
the stupid people are
what keep you in business.

05:20.342 --> 05:21.608
Well, just keep an open mind.

05:21.677 --> 05:23.292
Yes, people make stupid mistakes,

05:23.512 --> 05:24.689
but then we get to help them.

05:25.081 --> 05:26.321
That should make you feel good.

05:26.649 --> 05:28.855
- Thanks, Dr. Phil.
- Oh, you're welcome, Granville.

05:29.704 --> 05:32.394
And the key to maintaining a healthy
relationship is communication.

05:32.472 --> 05:34.506
- Ah, I see.
- And never stop fornicating.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.694
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

05:39.882 --> 05:42.179
Hey! Anchorman from "Tacoma Today."

05:42.499 --> 05:44.109
Good evening, I'm Chet Chisolm.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.144
Come in, please, gentlemen.
Quickly, quickly.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.263
Come in.

05:48.811 --> 05:50.303
I did something.

05:50.473 --> 05:52.319
And, well, uh...

05:53.485 --> 05:54.502
It got stuck.

05:54.980 --> 05:56.780
- Oh, God.
- Whoa! Wow, okay, okay.

05:56.846 --> 05:57.940
All right, okay.

05:58.083 --> 05:59.816
- Is that...
- My wedding ring.

05:59.882 --> 06:01.362
Yeah, you must really love your wife.

06:01.744 --> 06:04.024
- Thinking about her right now, huh?
- I can't get it off.

06:04.487 --> 06:06.585
Can you help me? Help.

06:10.793 --> 06:11.912
Ah.

06:12.428 --> 06:13.840
- Creepy.
- Right?

06:13.896 --> 06:15.793
I don't see this open fire anywhere.

06:16.031 --> 06:18.324
This full-moon stuff
freaks me out, man.

06:19.268 --> 06:22.316
It wasn't too long ago that a
girl was killed in these woods.

06:22.556 --> 06:23.577
Please don't do that.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.582
In fact, I don't even
think it was a girl.

06:25.908 --> 06:28.203
It was two firefighters just like us.

06:28.410 --> 06:30.809
And they haven't found the killer.

06:30.846 --> 06:32.429
Can you not? Just stop.

06:32.743 --> 06:34.242
- Oh.
- Just don't, Andy.

06:34.441 --> 06:36.217
I asked you not to do
it. Just stop it, okay?

06:36.241 --> 06:38.599
You think I'm a child?
You're not gonna scare me.

06:42.845 --> 06:43.956
What was that?

06:44.693 --> 06:45.767
I don't know. I-I, uh...

06:45.795 --> 06:47.216
- What's going on?
- Something hit the truck.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.266
- Can you get out and check, please?
- No, you check it out.

06:49.290 --> 06:51.716
Andy, I'm driving. I can't
get out of the vehicle.

06:51.767 --> 06:53.333
- Can you get out and check it out?
- I'm riding, I'm riding.

06:53.335 --> 06:54.600
- Why, are you scared?
- No.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.349
Station 24... this is
Firefighter McConky.

07:03.801 --> 07:06.436
Yeah, it's always the fourth 
Thursday in November.

07:06.904 --> 07:09.437
Yeah, you betcha. Have a nice evening.

07:10.207 --> 07:12.708
Who calls a fire station to
find out when Thanksgiving is?

07:12.789 --> 07:15.328
You know, I got to tell you,
your phone etiquette is top notch.

07:15.446 --> 07:17.575
Yeah, thanks. I guess
it's part of the job.

07:17.710 --> 07:19.940
Not really a job when you
love what you do, right?

07:20.186 --> 07:22.250
It's technically not a job
when you're a volunteer.

07:22.329 --> 07:23.988
Oh.

07:24.321 --> 07:26.855
Yeah. Good one. Now
we're having a good time.

07:26.857 --> 07:28.390
You seem a little upset. What gives?

07:28.392 --> 07:30.492
Okay, I'm the rookie. I get it.

07:30.494 --> 07:32.427
But I just thought this
whole full-moon night

07:32.429 --> 07:34.030
would've brought me
a little more action.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.769
Let me tell you something about firemen.

07:36.500 --> 07:40.386
On any given night, any given
day, they're always firemen.

07:41.005 --> 07:42.246
Did you just come up with that?

07:42.406 --> 07:44.581
"Backdraft," 1991.

07:45.021 --> 07:47.854
You know, Kurt Russell, Robert De Niro,
Rebecca De Mornay, Billy Baldwin,

07:47.878 --> 07:49.511
Jennifer Jason Leigh, Donald Sutherland.

07:49.648 --> 07:50.688
It's a Ron Howard joint.

07:50.948 --> 07:53.178
I've seen it 211 times.
It's a masterpiece.

07:53.484 --> 07:55.195
I can recite the entire
thing front to back.

07:55.219 --> 07:56.230
No, I've never seen it.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.579
Ho-ho, there she goes.
That's a good one.

07:58.722 --> 07:59.984
Yeah, no, I've never seen it.

08:00.302 --> 08:01.757
You're serious. You've
never seen "Backdraft."

08:01.759 --> 08:02.770
Seriously.

08:02.926 --> 08:04.693
You've never seen "Backdr..." Okay.

08:04.695 --> 08:06.028
Well, good thing I have it on my phone.

08:06.030 --> 08:07.877
Let's take a little break
and watch that movie.

08:08.232 --> 08:11.510
Oh, hey, Chief, I want to preface this
by saying I would never complain

08:11.535 --> 08:13.410
because I'm the rookie 
and your daughter,

08:13.435 --> 08:16.490
but, um, I thought you said tonight
was gonna be crazy for all of us.

08:16.720 --> 08:18.006
- Yeah, it will be.
- But hold on.

08:18.008 --> 08:20.776
And look, I do want this to sound 
more sarcastic than whiny,

08:20.778 --> 08:22.902
but I'm still mopping floors.

08:23.013 --> 08:24.197
All right, well, it sounds whiny,

08:24.221 --> 08:26.179
but that's what probies do, Lucy, okay?

08:26.204 --> 08:28.221
Trust me, I've been
doing this a long time.

08:28.317 --> 08:29.317
Just be ready.

08:29.686 --> 08:31.581
Ghoul!

08:31.917 --> 08:33.948
"Fire. It's a living thing, Brian.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.841
It breathes, it eats, and it hates.

08:35.893 --> 08:38.313
The only way to beat
it is to think like it. Eh."

08:41.113 --> 08:42.114
It's Robert De Niro.

08:42.138 --> 08:43.147
That was a very good
impression, by the way.

08:43.171 --> 08:45.726
- "Backdraft," he's in the...
- Is that one of the actors?

08:50.063 --> 08:52.455
So... how'd it happen?

08:52.576 --> 08:54.092
Details are sketchy.

08:54.211 --> 08:55.513
- News at 11:00?
- No, no, no.

08:55.579 --> 08:57.409
- I'm embarrassed to say.
- Allow me.

09:03.465 --> 09:04.941
You got takeout because
your wife's away.

09:04.965 --> 09:06.088
You got out of the shower and you were

09:06.090 --> 09:07.522
at the computer twirling
your wedding ring,

09:07.524 --> 09:09.357
spinning it around
on different things...

09:09.359 --> 09:11.226
pen, pretzel rod, letter opener...

09:11.228 --> 09:12.709
and that's when you said to yourself,

09:12.760 --> 09:14.901
"Hmm. I wonder if this fits."

09:15.132 --> 09:17.504
And you slipped the
ring onto your penis.

09:17.734 --> 09:20.001
But that's when you glanced
over at your computer

09:20.003 --> 09:21.973
and you saw that
picture of Katie Couric.

09:22.973 --> 09:24.272
Katie Couric's so hot.

09:24.274 --> 09:25.574
Mm-hmm. No, I get it, believe me.

09:25.576 --> 09:27.242
I'm a Diane Sawyer guy, but I get it.

09:27.244 --> 09:28.782
But that is when you became erect,

09:28.879 --> 09:30.584
the blood got trapped north of the ring,

09:30.647 --> 09:33.076
the ring got stuck, and 
boom, here we are.

09:33.217 --> 09:35.217
That is investigative prowess.

09:35.219 --> 09:37.182
- Whoa, Cap.
- I think it's the full moon.

09:37.270 --> 09:39.789
I probably should've
gone to the ER, but I...

09:40.090 --> 09:41.394
I'm marginally famous.

09:41.436 --> 09:43.802
So, the question is do we
cut off the ring or the penis?

09:43.827 --> 09:46.094
The ring! The ri... ring.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.242
All right. Got the
perfect thing for that.

09:48.457 --> 09:49.979
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

09:50.004 --> 09:51.444
- That's aggressive.
- I got the thing.

09:51.468 --> 09:53.474
- This guy.
- Oh, wow, that's for trees.

09:53.499 --> 09:55.435
- You know what... blowtorch.
- Granny, come on.

09:55.460 --> 09:57.239
His genitalia will
definitely feel the sting.

09:57.241 --> 09:59.674
Yes, genitalia will feel it.

09:59.676 --> 10:02.431
- Hey-o!
- Hey!

10:02.661 --> 10:05.160
Chet, I apologize about
the little back and forth.

10:05.185 --> 10:06.947
We just wanted to take
your mind off of things.

10:06.971 --> 10:08.194
Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you.

10:08.218 --> 10:11.014
Thank you both. That...
Goodnight and good luck.

10:11.088 --> 10:12.563
Whoa, there it was. Do it again.

10:12.627 --> 10:13.922
Goodnight and good luck.

10:14.010 --> 10:16.115
- Ooh.
- Every time, right?

10:16.195 --> 10:17.392
- Goodnight and good luck.
- I love it.

10:17.394 --> 10:18.689
Look, it has an inscription.

10:18.729 --> 10:20.028
No, no, I'm good, I'm good.

10:28.081 --> 10:30.090
Ah, see? This is weird, man.

10:30.174 --> 10:31.465
This is weird.

10:32.242 --> 10:33.387
Excuse me.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.631
Tacoma Fire Department. We're gonna...

10:35.746 --> 10:37.143
Stop stepping on my hose!

10:37.168 --> 10:38.558
Who the hell are these people, man?

10:38.582 --> 10:42.240
Is it truly necessary to extinguish
the lunar flame of Quietus?

10:42.753 --> 10:45.237
Are you in charge of the...
the scary dancing and stuff here?

10:45.332 --> 10:46.340
That is correct.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.578
- I am Tothar.
- Okay.

10:48.629 --> 10:50.328
Uh, all right, Tolthar.

10:50.364 --> 10:53.142
Um, so you can't have an
open flame out here, pal.

10:53.800 --> 10:56.945
But this is the sacrificial night.
We need all four elements

10:56.970 --> 11:00.894
to properly honor the
super blue blood moon.

11:00.940 --> 11:03.451
Well, we're gonna have to take
away the element of fire,

11:03.476 --> 11:04.916
but we'll leave you with some water.

11:05.058 --> 11:06.272
Dude, are you serious?

11:06.546 --> 11:07.717
- Yeah.
- Water?

11:08.148 --> 11:09.156
- Yeah.
- We need all four elements.

11:09.180 --> 11:10.687
- I just said that.
- Sorry, man.

11:10.712 --> 11:11.902
You know, just doing our job.

11:11.985 --> 11:14.005
We're not jumping in
the fire, guys, come on.

11:14.120 --> 11:15.529
- Aah!
- How you doing, ma'am?

11:15.554 --> 11:17.084
- Aah!
- Hey, hey, hey!

11:18.224 --> 11:19.292
What the hell, man?!

11:19.626 --> 11:21.745
Why are your friends biting?

11:23.144 --> 11:24.167
Aah!

11:24.876 --> 11:26.376
This kills, man.

11:26.700 --> 11:27.989
That's why we wear our gloves, buddy.

11:28.013 --> 11:29.167
Really?

11:29.169 --> 11:31.176
She broke the skin, but
it doesn't seem too bad,

11:31.201 --> 11:32.247
so don't worry.

11:32.272 --> 11:34.105
Honestly, man, back in my day,

11:34.107 --> 11:36.107
it was just flapjacks
and finger banging.

11:36.109 --> 11:38.242
Now it's lunar sacrifice and biting.

11:39.412 --> 11:40.611
Why would she bite me?

11:42.349 --> 11:43.815
I was a medic in the US Army.

11:43.917 --> 11:46.551
You telling me helping people
doesn't interest you at all anymore?

11:46.853 --> 11:48.757
This man is stuck inside a thermos.

11:55.362 --> 11:56.650
Yeah, you're right.

11:56.830 --> 11:57.952
It's stuck on there tight.

11:58.357 --> 11:59.374
What's in the thermos?

11:59.399 --> 12:01.019
I mean, my dick.

12:01.368 --> 12:02.590
Thought that, but...

12:02.640 --> 12:04.072
Uh, and some pretty good soup.

12:04.170 --> 12:05.880
Okay, I'm gonna tell
you how this happened.

12:06.272 --> 12:07.659
This is good. Watch this.

12:12.412 --> 12:14.277
You liked the soup so
much, you fucked it.

12:14.348 --> 12:15.363
He gets me.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.050
Whoa, man, I've had good soup before,

12:17.075 --> 12:18.265
but never enough to fuck it.

12:18.451 --> 12:19.892
No, no, this isn't good soup.

12:19.953 --> 12:21.503
This is great soup.

12:21.654 --> 12:24.071
Minestrone... champagne of soup.

12:24.523 --> 12:25.809
Here's the thing, though...

12:25.834 --> 12:28.412
Uh, my dick's starting to
hurt, and I got to take a piss.

12:28.495 --> 12:29.961
You know, that might be our best bet.

12:29.963 --> 12:31.127
- What?
- Urinate.

12:31.464 --> 12:32.464
In my dinner?

12:32.532 --> 12:33.876
Dude, it's still warm.

12:34.033 --> 12:35.733
You're not still planning
on eating that, are you?

12:35.735 --> 12:37.402
Well, yeah. Waste not, want not, right?

12:37.404 --> 12:39.036
You know what? That's
admirable, but, uh,

12:39.038 --> 12:40.605
I'm gonna need you to relax and go

12:40.974 --> 12:42.940
in one... two...

12:42.942 --> 12:44.784
You know, counting is
actually not helping.

12:44.979 --> 12:46.057
...three.

12:46.179 --> 12:47.892
Oh, that helped. Ohh.

12:48.281 --> 12:49.503
Simple physics, really.

12:49.849 --> 12:51.900
The space inside the thermos is finite.

12:52.118 --> 12:53.818
And when you add matter to that space...

12:53.863 --> 12:54.952
Oh!

12:57.190 --> 12:58.704
Oh, man, that worked!

12:58.992 --> 13:00.610
You guys are awesome!

13:00.994 --> 13:02.055
Uh, one thing.

13:02.357 --> 13:04.618
I still got a soda can 
in my ass, though.

13:04.697 --> 13:06.008
What are we gonna do about that one?

13:06.032 --> 13:07.185
Dude.

13:07.338 --> 13:08.845
I'm going to the truck.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.144
Station 24.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.725
Is it a beep or a chirp?

13:28.188 --> 13:29.561
Yeah, well, that's your battery.

13:30.566 --> 13:32.233
Oh, uh, you can get batteries

13:32.292 --> 13:33.866
at any hardware store or grocery store.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.519
Or any store, really.

13:35.833 --> 13:37.433
All right, you, too.
Have a nice evening.

13:41.009 --> 13:44.509
Wow, guys. It is really crazy in here.

13:44.704 --> 13:45.810
Well, not really.

13:45.898 --> 13:47.794
Just making some of my
famous five-alarm chili.

13:48.308 --> 13:49.644
Are you sure that's a good idea?

13:49.742 --> 13:52.114
We could get called into
action at any moment.

13:52.212 --> 13:53.781
Do I detect a hint of sarcasm?

13:54.146 --> 13:55.321
Not from me.

13:55.582 --> 13:56.902
Is that where that stuff belongs?

14:04.591 --> 14:06.888
Four-letter word for English coin.

14:06.913 --> 14:08.265
- Ghoul?
- Yen.

14:08.824 --> 14:10.044
No, didn't fit.

14:10.170 --> 14:11.180
Nickel.

14:12.037 --> 14:13.440
No. No, not nickel.

14:13.508 --> 14:14.543
Shilling?

14:14.601 --> 14:15.979
Oh, yeah, shilling. Good.

14:16.161 --> 14:17.759
Did you get the GPS working?

14:18.356 --> 14:20.926
Uh, no. There's no signal. It's, uh...

14:21.564 --> 14:24.458
I guess the full moon,
it's the gravitational pull.

14:24.677 --> 14:26.117
The gravitational pull of what?

14:26.331 --> 14:27.934
The Internet?

14:28.081 --> 14:29.180
Blech!

14:29.244 --> 14:30.897
Oh, man.

14:31.060 --> 14:32.060
I feel like crap.

14:32.118 --> 14:33.718
Ah, did you eat the pork for dinner?

14:33.786 --> 14:35.920
I'm so sweaty.

14:37.991 --> 14:39.497
I think it's this bite.

14:39.959 --> 14:41.592
No, no, no. I cleaned
it, and then Granny

14:41.594 --> 14:43.459
will take a look at it when we get back.

14:45.365 --> 14:46.724
Maybe it's the moon.

14:47.367 --> 14:48.367
What?

14:48.591 --> 14:50.784
Ohh, no.

14:51.771 --> 14:53.359
You don't think that girl was...

14:54.340 --> 14:55.557
like, a werewolf, do you?

14:57.210 --> 14:59.646
- What if she's a werewolf, Andy?
- No way, man.

14:59.693 --> 15:03.319
I tell you, I can... I can hear everything.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.605
It's like my senses are
heightened, you know?

15:07.260 --> 15:08.940
I can hear the animals.

15:09.241 --> 15:10.888
I can hear their little heartbeats.

15:14.060 --> 15:15.809
- Come on, man, let's...
- Aah!

15:16.429 --> 15:18.411
Andy, I think she was a werewolf, man!

15:18.489 --> 15:19.570
All right, cut it out, Ike.

15:19.617 --> 15:21.769
Check my teeth. Are... Are they growing?

15:23.328 --> 15:25.899
- Andy, look! Look at my teeth!
- Cut it out. Come on, man.

15:26.139 --> 15:27.805
- Andy, look at my teeth!
- Cut it out!

15:27.807 --> 15:29.019
I said cut it out!

15:32.353 --> 15:34.716
So help me God, Cap, if
this is one more dick,

15:34.741 --> 15:37.241
- I'm gonna lose it.
- Come on, don't be re-dick-ulous.

15:38.527 --> 15:39.669
Tacoma FD.

15:39.795 --> 15:41.034
Door's open!

15:41.763 --> 15:42.883
Just go, yeah.

15:43.899 --> 15:45.110
Oh, man, it smells good in here.

15:45.134 --> 15:46.900
Hey, full moon or not,
there's more to our jobs

15:46.902 --> 15:48.679
than just getting guys'
dongs unstuck from...

15:48.704 --> 15:50.139
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, come on!

15:50.164 --> 15:52.465
I know, right? I mean, this is crazy.

15:52.608 --> 15:55.703
I feel exactly the same way you
gentlemen feel, believe me.

15:55.812 --> 15:57.979
Sir, your junk better not
be inside of that toaster.

15:58.013 --> 15:59.806
That's okay 'cause I
unplugged it already.

16:00.909 --> 16:02.671
Mmm-mmm!

16:03.619 --> 16:06.139
You know, Captain Stanky
Stankiewicz gave me this chili recipe.

16:06.455 --> 16:07.706
He said, "Make it hot.

16:08.023 --> 16:09.825
That's how firefighters live life!"

16:09.892 --> 16:11.007
Sounds like "Backdraft."

16:11.093 --> 16:13.235
You know what, it does. Mmm.

16:16.031 --> 16:18.140
Hey there, ma'am. Can we help you?

16:23.333 --> 16:25.206
I-I'm sorry, I don't...
I don't speak, uh...

16:25.507 --> 16:27.587
I think she wants us to put
that car seat in her car.

16:27.712 --> 16:30.420
Oh, we... we... we can't
do that. It's a liability issue.

16:30.445 --> 16:31.689
You should know that, by the way.

16:31.713 --> 16:33.354
- Nyet.
- Nyet?

16:33.379 --> 16:34.433
Nyet.

16:39.591 --> 16:41.454
- Nyet, baby seat.
- Nyet, nyet.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.917
What's going on?

16:47.963 --> 16:49.717
She wants us to install a car seat.

16:52.267 --> 16:53.425
We don't do that.

16:54.870 --> 16:56.503
Liability issue!

16:57.706 --> 16:59.954
May I suggest the police station?

17:03.173 --> 17:05.222
Come on, what's the big
deal? It's just a car seat.

17:05.252 --> 17:06.546
We're not doing anything today.

17:06.619 --> 17:08.422
Fine. Where's your car, ma'am?

17:08.446 --> 17:09.560
Honda.

17:09.638 --> 17:11.458
Honda, okay, great.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.994
- I'll help.
- Not necessary.

17:14.156 --> 17:16.756
Please let me do something.

17:16.971 --> 17:19.384
Okay, come on.

17:19.694 --> 17:21.406
Here we are, ma'am. Why
don't you have a seat?

17:21.430 --> 17:22.542
Here you go.

17:23.739 --> 17:25.614
You know what? How about some chili?

17:25.982 --> 17:28.869
Here we go. Mm-hmm.

17:28.937 --> 17:30.219
Just like the old country.

17:30.339 --> 17:32.275
- Ooh.
- Yes.

17:32.832 --> 17:34.832
One, two...

17:35.144 --> 17:36.164
Three!

17:41.053 --> 17:42.096
Ohh!

17:42.660 --> 17:43.860
I think it's caught in the coils.

17:43.884 --> 17:45.784
- No shit.
- Okay. One, two, three!

17:48.090 --> 17:49.422
Ohh! Ohh! God!

17:49.424 --> 17:51.524
Thank you. Oh, thank you.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.272
Yeah, anytime.

17:55.197 --> 17:57.791
Nice crumbshot.

17:57.899 --> 17:59.085
Lock the door.

17:59.990 --> 18:03.006
Oh, my hands are stretching!

18:03.538 --> 18:05.238
You know, like when the
Werewolf's hands stretch

18:05.240 --> 18:07.278
right in front of his
face in that movie?!

18:07.309 --> 18:08.351
It was a movie.

18:08.376 --> 18:10.242
Yeah, that's what's
happening to me right now.

18:10.512 --> 18:11.756
Right now, Andy!

18:11.980 --> 18:14.526
And I am ravenous!

18:15.755 --> 18:17.757
And you know I never
use three-syllable words.

18:17.986 --> 18:19.369
Just chill out. Just chill out.

18:20.589 --> 18:21.817
Okay.

18:22.024 --> 18:23.270
No offense, Andy,

18:23.659 --> 18:26.408
but you look delicious right now.

18:26.762 --> 18:27.768
Do I look juicy?

18:29.598 --> 18:31.231
Marbleized?

18:46.409 --> 18:48.758
You smell so good.

18:48.850 --> 18:51.051
I'm definitely a wolf.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.486
We have to go back and find that girl

18:53.488 --> 18:55.033
so I can find out
what's happening to me.

18:55.057 --> 18:56.389
We don't need to find her.

18:56.391 --> 18:58.434
If we don't go back and find that girl,

18:59.027 --> 19:02.873
- I'm gonna eat you!
- Okay, okay, okay, we'll find her!

19:02.898 --> 19:03.963
We'll find her!

19:03.965 --> 19:05.532
Do you want me to drive?!

19:07.186 --> 19:09.027
It's easy. You just find the
clasps and you hook them in.

19:09.051 --> 19:10.262
There's nothing easy about that.

19:10.286 --> 19:11.979
Breathe in and out of your... face.

19:12.004 --> 19:13.802
I don't know what happened!

19:13.826 --> 19:15.135
- Holy shit!
- Oh, my God.

19:15.809 --> 19:17.761
One minute she was
enjoying my delicious chili,

19:17.763 --> 19:18.963
and the next, her water broke.

19:19.064 --> 19:21.215
You fed your five-alarm
chili to a pregnant woman?

19:21.410 --> 19:22.643
Hey, it's really good chili.

19:22.668 --> 19:24.369
Ohh! Oh, no, my chili!

19:24.608 --> 19:26.004
All right, here we go,

19:26.005 --> 19:27.036
here we go, here we go.

19:27.988 --> 19:29.508
Take deep breaths, deep breaths.

19:29.608 --> 19:30.972
Just push.

19:31.226 --> 19:32.393
Ghoul, put that fire out.

19:32.476 --> 19:33.597
Should we call an ambulance?

19:33.649 --> 19:35.525
No, no, I can see the head.
This baby's coming.

19:35.549 --> 19:36.554
We're gonna deliver it.

19:38.127 --> 19:39.690
Rescue 42... Summit Park.

19:39.715 --> 19:41.213
Male missing an appendage.

19:42.777 --> 19:45.404
Rescue 42 en route.

19:45.491 --> 19:46.951
You like my French accent?

19:47.059 --> 19:48.872
Super blue blood moon!

19:49.528 --> 19:51.005
Man, just take me home.

19:51.030 --> 19:52.062
Just take me home.

19:52.064 --> 19:53.330
Oh, come on, it's a missing appendage.

19:53.332 --> 19:54.364
It's not gonna be another dick.

19:54.366 --> 19:55.366
No, it's gonna be a dick.

19:55.781 --> 19:56.786
The night we're having,

19:56.811 --> 19:58.971
we're gonna walk right
into a damn peen-ectomy.

20:00.641 --> 20:01.678
How you doing, friend?

20:01.796 --> 20:03.029
I lost my toe.

20:03.166 --> 20:05.132
Yes.

20:05.190 --> 20:07.435
Yes, it's a toe. It's a toe, dude.

20:07.714 --> 20:09.372
I'm glad somebody happy about it.

20:09.857 --> 20:10.983
Granny, not cool.

20:11.530 --> 20:12.760
Sorry. I...

20:13.609 --> 20:14.610
How'd it happen?

20:14.797 --> 20:16.515
I got it caught in my bicycle spokes.

20:16.622 --> 20:18.114
Didn't your mama ever tell
you not to ride your bike

20:18.138 --> 20:20.415
- without your shoes on?
- I like my sandals.

20:20.550 --> 20:22.791
All right, well, let's see
if we can get you bandaged up,

20:22.841 --> 20:24.527
and then we'll get you
to the ER, all right?

20:24.551 --> 20:26.518
We can get that reattached.
Now, where's the toe?

20:26.672 --> 20:30.012
Went flying off that
way. I hope you find it,

20:30.166 --> 20:32.436
'cause I lost one on the
other foot in Vietnam.

20:32.527 --> 20:34.025
I served in Afghanistan.

20:34.432 --> 20:36.273
Well, it look like you still serving.

20:36.670 --> 20:40.104
He sure is, sir. He sure is.

20:40.345 --> 20:41.803
Would you find that toe, please?

20:41.844 --> 20:42.925
I can.

20:56.176 --> 20:57.343
Ike? Ike?

20:57.397 --> 20:58.896
Andy, Andy! You better go.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.547
I'm not responsible for
what I do when I turn!

21:02.825 --> 21:04.796
Just go. Run.

21:05.121 --> 21:06.304
You have to save yourself.

21:06.468 --> 21:08.975
- What?
- Run, Andy! Run! Run!

21:09.128 --> 21:10.489
Whoa, he looks like he's tripping.

21:10.522 --> 21:12.150
- Where's the girl?
- Oh, boy.

21:12.292 --> 21:13.688
Where's the girl?!

21:13.792 --> 21:15.506
Shauna is, uh...

21:15.689 --> 21:17.847
Oh, she's there. That's Shauna.

21:18.569 --> 21:22.532
Oh, she took red
pelican ecstasy, though.

21:23.041 --> 21:24.173
She might bite again.

21:24.256 --> 21:25.367
It's an intense roll.

21:25.859 --> 21:26.991
Oh, okay.

21:27.016 --> 21:28.577
Yeah, yeah, she bit him and...

21:28.846 --> 21:30.485
Wow, that must've been
some powerful stuff

21:30.509 --> 21:31.775
if it got into his system.

21:31.867 --> 21:32.970
Thank goodness.

21:32.995 --> 21:35.322
I really thought he was
gonna turn into a wolf.

21:35.567 --> 21:37.749
- That's LARP, man.
- What?

21:37.962 --> 21:39.479
LARP... Live Action Role-play.

21:39.542 --> 21:40.550
It's what we do here.

21:40.622 --> 21:42.488
Hey, you look cool.
Give me your e-mail.

21:42.633 --> 21:44.059
I'll put you on the next blast.

21:44.111 --> 21:45.757
I'm good, man.

21:45.902 --> 21:47.463
Andy, Andy.

21:47.796 --> 21:50.924
Shauna, Kenneth, and Starboy
want to go to the zoo for a little bit,

21:50.949 --> 21:52.161
and I told them that you could drive us.

21:52.466 --> 21:53.498
Are you cool to drive?

21:53.652 --> 21:57.326
- Uh, yeah, I guess.
- He said yes! He said yes!

21:57.670 --> 21:59.066
Yes!

21:59.733 --> 22:01.766
Wow.

22:01.960 --> 22:04.181
Okay.

22:04.429 --> 22:05.943
Guys, we're going to the zoo!

22:07.905 --> 22:09.229
How long will this last for?

22:09.473 --> 22:12.015
- About six hours.
- Yipes.

22:12.090 --> 22:14.190
Come on, you guys!

22:16.251 --> 22:19.408
Ohh!

22:19.501 --> 22:21.789
All right, here we go, 
here we go, here we go.

22:22.983 --> 22:24.958
Ghoul, get the fire extinguisher!

22:24.983 --> 22:26.483
I don't know where anything is here!

22:26.485 --> 22:27.747
Oh, my God, is that the head?

22:27.996 --> 22:29.255
Oh, that's very bloody.

22:29.987 --> 22:31.677
Oh, my God!

22:31.702 --> 22:33.700
All right, listen, you're
gonna deliver this baby.

22:33.725 --> 22:35.192
- I'm gonna put the fire out.
- What?!

22:35.194 --> 22:37.756
When she pushes, just
gently guide it out, okay?

22:37.781 --> 22:39.448
- Don't pull, guide.
- Don't... Don't pull.

22:39.472 --> 22:40.638
- Yeah.
- Guide.

22:40.866 --> 22:42.008
Okay.

22:42.033 --> 22:43.255
All right, sweetheart, we got this.

22:43.279 --> 22:44.839
It's gonna be okay. You're doing great.

22:44.902 --> 22:46.325
Just push. Push.

22:46.350 --> 22:47.794
Push. All right, breathe.

22:47.940 --> 22:49.651
Okay. Yes.

22:50.660 --> 22:53.144
I see... I see the head. You're
almost there. Just push.

22:53.169 --> 22:55.249
Here she comes. Here she
comes! Here comes the baby!

22:55.288 --> 22:57.288
Push. Oh, my gosh!

22:57.472 --> 23:00.059
It's a beautiful girl.

23:02.020 --> 23:03.123
Impressive, probie.

23:04.847 --> 23:07.035
Oh, my gosh.

23:07.097 --> 23:09.358
Ano... Another one?

23:09.728 --> 23:10.898
She's... She's... Twins?

23:10.923 --> 23:12.623
- Uh-huh.
- Okay.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.099
Pretty boring night, huh, probie?

23:14.159 --> 23:16.027
Full moons are not bullshit.

23:20.885 --> 23:23.353
Man, it's like trying to
find a toe in a haystack.

23:24.751 --> 23:26.634
Hey, yo, Cap, why don't you
use that Sherlock Holmes stuff

23:26.658 --> 23:27.806
that you was doing earlier?

23:28.059 --> 23:29.710
Not working. I can't see anything.

23:29.994 --> 23:31.316
Flashlight's broken.

23:32.271 --> 23:34.191
'Cause it's not a flashlight.

23:34.216 --> 23:35.241
It's my Breezy Canyon.

23:36.267 --> 23:37.414
What? I was curious.

23:37.969 --> 23:39.026
I got to tell you guys,

23:39.050 --> 23:41.217
being at the station was
way more epic tonight.

23:41.439 --> 23:43.139
Looking for a toe's
definitely a step down

23:43.141 --> 23:45.478
from delivering twins
and putting out fires.

23:45.543 --> 23:46.876
And fighting off werewolves.

23:46.878 --> 23:48.933
- Hey, where is Ike, anyway?
- He's still in the ER.

23:49.314 --> 23:50.813
I tried to return him into the wild,

23:50.815 --> 23:53.045
but he developed a real
taste for civilization.

23:53.217 --> 23:54.522
I'll tell you one thing, Cap,

23:54.652 --> 23:56.688
I learned a real life lesson tonight.

23:56.821 --> 23:58.582
- Yeah, what's that?
- That there is nothing,

23:58.823 --> 24:02.275
I mean nothing more gratifying
than the look in a man's eyes

24:02.527 --> 24:04.327
when you free his junk from captivity.

24:04.329 --> 24:06.109
Guys are ridiculous.

24:06.186 --> 24:08.268
I mean, what night do we
get all the calls about women

24:08.292 --> 24:09.783
sticking stuff in their hoo-hahs?

24:09.968 --> 24:11.674
- My birthday.
- Oh, hey!

24:11.903 --> 24:13.568
- I found something.
- No, no, no, no.

24:13.593 --> 24:14.670
I got it, I got it.

24:14.672 --> 24:15.697
Look at this.

24:16.824 --> 24:18.244
- That's a toe.
- Oh, yeah.

24:18.343 --> 24:20.649
- Oh, yeah, that's a toe.
- Oh, well, what is...

24:21.093 --> 24:22.777
Oh, my God, that's a dick!
