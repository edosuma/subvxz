What's a stagehand?

04:01.475 --> 04:03.544
In order to control
the environment on certain ops,

04:03.544 --> 04:06.314
we sometimes fill the target
location with agents.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.081
And so this evening,
we will all be posing

04:08.081 --> 04:10.351
as hotel guests,
servers, and bartenders.

04:10.351 --> 04:12.119

I doubt it. I'm sorry.
That's not...

04:30.904 --> 04:34.875
But you know what, though?
Antoinette, you could join us.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.811
You are an employee of the FBI,
and this is a low-risk op,

04:37.811 --> 04:39.313
so I can make it happen
if you'd like.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.015
Could be fun.
Say yes!

04:42.015 --> 04:43.684
All right.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.618
Great.
Yeah, great.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.619

04:45.619 --> 04:46.954
Gun? No.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.656
No.

04:58.499 --> 05:00.901
I'm Supervisory Special Agent
Louis Cronin

05:00.901 --> 05:02.836
from the San Diego Field Office.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.372
I realize this is your house,

05:04.372 --> 05:07.575
but it's my op,
so what I say goes.

05:07.575 --> 05:10.544
My Cyber Crimes unit has been
monitoring dark web chatter.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.346
An unsub with
top secret clearance

05:12.346 --> 05:14.247
has offered up stolen
military technology

05:14.247 --> 05:15.182
to the highest bidder.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.720
It's taken months, but our unsub
has agreed to sell the tech

05:19.720 --> 05:22.155
to someone they believe
is a Russian operative

05:22.155 --> 05:24.725
but who is actually
Special Agent Ritchie Abrams.

05:24.725 --> 05:25.893
What kind of technology?

05:27.260 --> 05:29.329
Designs for a military satellite
that can track submarines

05:29.329 --> 05:31.399
up to 200 meters
below the ocean.

05:31.399 --> 05:33.467
If this tech gets into the hands
of our foreign enemies,

05:33.467 --> 05:35.669
this could be catastrophic
for our Navy, right?

05:35.669 --> 05:38.038
Which military contractor
was the tech being stolen from?

05:38.038 --> 05:40.408
DoD uses several vendors
to build different aspects

05:40.408 --> 05:42.576
of the satellite,
which means we're not sure.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.578
So we know a whole lot
of nothing?

05:44.578 --> 05:47.881
Yes, but what we do know is that
our unsub reached out today

05:47.881 --> 05:49.316
and arranged a deal--

05:49.316 --> 05:52.152
satellite tech
in exchange for $2 million.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.822
Now, they said to put
all the money

05:54.822 --> 05:57.725
in this specific model and color
Mont Clair briefcase

05:57.725 --> 05:59.627
and that they'd show up
with a matching briefcase

05:59.627 --> 06:01.662
that's got
the satellite tech inside.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.197
That exchange is set up
for 10:00 p.m. tonight

06:04.197 --> 06:05.899
at the Luciana Hotel bar.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.535
Any questions?
One.

06:07.535 --> 06:10.838
Are you sure you only
want me to be a stagehand?

06:10.838 --> 06:13.140
'Cause I think I would be
much better

06:13.140 --> 06:15.075
as Ritchie's
hot side piece.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.209
You see it.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.078
Who are you?
Simone Clark.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.913
And you work here?
I'm a special agent.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.715
Then act like one.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.116
Do as you're told.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.618
Stay out of my team's way.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.454
Yes, sir.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.221
You're dismissed.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.034
Of course.
I'll bring that...

06:41.034 --> 06:44.404
Ah. Table for two. Yes?
Right this way.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.907
You got stuck being a waiter,
huh, boss?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.341
No, I chose to be.

06:48.341 --> 06:50.811
Gives me free rein
all over the restaurant.

06:50.811 --> 06:53.246
Now, remember, our unsub
could probably already be here,

06:53.246 --> 06:55.983
so no shop talk
and no calling me "boss."

06:55.983 --> 06:57.451
Have a good evening.

06:57.451 --> 07:01.154
Ooh. Carter,
this lighting is fantastic.

07:01.154 --> 07:03.957
Give me your phone
so I can get your glow-up photo.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.392
You're not gonna stop
until I give in, are you?

07:05.392 --> 07:06.460
I'm not.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.272
Ritchie's in position.

07:22.375 --> 07:23.811
And now we wait.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.316
My first undercover mission.

07:29.316 --> 07:30.851
This is so exciting.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.486
You're not mad
I brought you here?

07:32.486 --> 07:35.523
Mad? I feel like
I'm in a John le Carré novel.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.390
I love seeing this side
of you.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.661
What,
my sexy spy side?

07:40.661 --> 07:42.496
Stick around.

07:42.496 --> 07:46.133
Okay. Carter, less ax murderer,
more leading man.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.400
Go.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.670
Well, yeah. Okay.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.404
That's a nice
thirst-trap photo,

07:51.404 --> 07:53.340
but I'm thinking the real issue
is your bio.

07:53.340 --> 07:55.175
You got to play up
to your strengths.

07:55.175 --> 07:56.409
You know,
you got a cool job.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.746
I'm not gonna put "FBI agent"
on my profile.

07:58.746 --> 08:00.748
Why? Women love a man
with a badge.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.849
Mm-hmm.
Don't worry.

08:01.849 --> 08:03.216
I'll do it for you.

08:03.216 --> 08:07.354
Here are your two
classic <i>mocktails.</i>

08:07.354 --> 08:09.489
Oh. Excuse me.

08:11.659 --> 08:14.461
I just got an alert
from L.A. Clear.
And?

08:14.461 --> 08:15.796
There was a murder
in a parking garage

08:15.796 --> 08:17.631
at Aerospace Relativity.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.967
That's one of the firms with
access to the satellite tech.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.302
<i>Yeah. An engineer by the name
of Spencer Gordon</i>

08:22.302 --> 08:23.971
<i>was garroted in his car.</i>

08:23.971 --> 08:25.706
No suspects
and no surveillance.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.875
He's got the correct
security clearance.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.811
That cannot be a coincidence.
Did they find the tech on him?

08:30.811 --> 08:32.212
No.
The car was empty.

08:32.212 --> 08:34.014
All right.
I'll send agents down there.

08:34.014 --> 08:36.016
<i>Copy that.</i>

08:36.016 --> 08:37.718
<i>Will there be anything else
for you?</i>

08:37.718 --> 08:39.987
No.
Is, uh, everything okay?

08:39.987 --> 08:41.454
We're fine.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.726
So we're just supposed to
sit here and make small talk?

08:45.726 --> 08:48.962
Seems odd, considering
the circumstances.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.865
You know, before I was an actor,
I was an extra

08:51.865 --> 08:54.467
on some kid shows,
and to make the time pass,

08:54.467 --> 08:57.838
I would create
these elaborate backstories.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.573
I wasn't just sitting
on a bench.

08:59.573 --> 09:03.744
I was... sitting on a bench
waiting for my brother,

09:03.744 --> 09:07.180
who stole my inheritance
and my girlfriend.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.016
I was plotting my revenge.

09:10.350 --> 09:12.152
Sounds like fun. Yeah.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.788
So... who am I?

09:14.788 --> 09:20.460
You are... Madame Debuchy,

09:20.460 --> 09:23.196
the haughty owner
of a rival hotel

09:23.196 --> 09:26.499
who's here
scouting the competition.

09:26.499 --> 09:28.736
Haughty?
Yeah. Haughty.

09:28.736 --> 09:30.570
I like that.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.708
And you're Gustav,
the fiery chef de cuisine

09:34.708 --> 09:36.209
I've been trying
to poach.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.668
Your phone has been
blowing up, Carter.

10:00.668 --> 10:02.970
Mm-hmm.
Let us see
those new profile matches.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.372
Come on. You wouldn't have any
if it weren't for us.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.074
All right. But you're not
allowed to message back.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.809
Okay.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.311
Too thirsty.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.013
She has dead eyes.
Little bit.

10:13.013 --> 10:14.882
Ooh!

10:14.882 --> 10:16.650
She can hang
for a night.

10:16.650 --> 10:17.818
Mm-hmm.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.787
She wrote back,

10:19.787 --> 10:21.288
"Arrest me, Daddy."

10:21.288 --> 10:22.289
Yes!

10:22.289 --> 10:23.356
I'm not dating
this woman.

10:23.356 --> 10:25.292
Why not?
Oh, come on, Carter.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.794
We all know
you've used cuffs before.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.663
Ooh!
Laura is freaky.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.609
Our unsub has landed.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.013
Arrest team, stand by.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.656
Hi!

10:59.659 --> 11:02.229
False alarm. Stand down.
I repeat-- False alarm.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.530
Stand down.

11:09.636 --> 11:12.405
Seven minutes past the scheduled
meet. What do we got?

11:12.405 --> 11:14.207
Agents just finished searching
Spencer Gordon's apartment

11:14.207 --> 11:16.143
and his personal computer.
And?

11:16.143 --> 11:17.477
<i>The dark web account
we've been talking with</i>

11:17.477 --> 11:19.146
belonged to him.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.214
That means your seller is dead.
Someone got to him first.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.016
And that the tech
is out in the open.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.452
Damn it.
All right. Kill it.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.720
There's no point sitting around
waiting for a dead man

11:26.720 --> 11:28.488
to show up.

11:28.488 --> 11:31.358
Copy that.
We're gonna wrap things up.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.660
Looks like our guy's
not gonna show.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.195
You sure about that?

11:37.697 --> 11:40.700
<i>Cronin, he's here.
Positive I.D. on the briefcase.</i>

11:40.700 --> 11:42.502
Maybe Spencer
had a partner.

11:42.502 --> 11:45.072
Yeah. Or maybe it's his killer
or someone else.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.306
Or maybe both.

11:52.980 --> 11:54.147
Open it.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.020
Is this a joke?

12:00.020 --> 12:02.155
I don't know.
Is it?

12:02.155 --> 12:04.191
You know what?
I have had enough of this.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.125
Take him.
No, no, no, no, no.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.860
We take him now,
we got nothing.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.228
Let's follow him,
see where it leads.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.562
Not your call, Matt.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.663
<i>Arrest him. Take him.</i>

12:17.370 --> 12:20.173
Let's go!
Get in there!

12:20.173 --> 12:21.875
FBI.
You're under arrest.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.310
Arrest? For what?

12:23.310 --> 12:25.178
I'm just a Task-a-Lot
gig worker.

12:25.178 --> 12:28.648
I got paid 500 bucks on an app
to come here, wear this pin,

12:28.648 --> 12:30.517
and meet some dude
to swap briefcases.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.785
He's just a patsy.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.353
And we've just been made.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.721
Damn.

12:44.932 --> 12:47.400
We are taking over the case
from Cronin.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.736
He doesn't look too happy
about it.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.839
Yeah. Well, HQ is pissed that
he pulled the trigger too soon.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.140
So what do we got?

12:53.140 --> 12:54.574
Courier's story
checks out.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.209
He was hired off an app
to role-play the deal.

12:56.209 --> 12:57.477
Thought it was a practical joke
or something.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.446
So they used him as bait
to suss out whether

12:59.446 --> 13:01.014
there was law enforcement
in here, huh?

13:01.014 --> 13:02.315
And we fell for it. Yeah.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.351
Well, can we track him,
at least, on the app?

13:04.351 --> 13:05.618
Cyber Crimes said
there's no way.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.955
This guy's clever,
probably tech-savvy.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.556
Somehow he figured out
that Spencer Gordon

13:09.556 --> 13:11.859
was going to steal
the satellite R and sell it.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.226
So he kills him

13:13.226 --> 13:15.228
and then piggybacks off
of Spencer's deal.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.564
I bet if Cronin never ordered us
to move in,

13:17.564 --> 13:19.666
whoever is behind this
would have eventually

13:19.666 --> 13:22.202
come out of hiding
to make the exchange.

13:22.202 --> 13:24.171
Damn.
We were so close!

13:24.171 --> 13:26.339
Well, what's done
is done, okay?

13:26.339 --> 13:28.175
Now, we got work to do.

13:28.175 --> 13:29.542
Carter, you and Simone head over
to the scene

13:29.542 --> 13:30.810
of Spencer Gordon's murder.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.646
See what you can find.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.549
Let's check the specs
on this pin camera,

13:36.549 --> 13:38.051
see if there's a serial number
or something.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.552
Get it to the lab immediately.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.622
You know, boss,
I sort of have a lab right here.

13:42.622 --> 13:44.224
Okay.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.225
Did you have gloves
in your purse?

13:45.225 --> 13:46.860
I'm always prepared.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.335
I've seen this type
of spy cam before.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.870
There won't be
a serial number on it,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.405
so tracing it
will be a challenge.

13:58.405 --> 14:01.508
But it's short range--
about 50 meters.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.011
50 meters? That means our unsub
was inside the hotel.

14:04.011 --> 14:07.014
Okay. Brendon, get your hands
on all hotel security footage

14:07.014 --> 14:08.381
and find out
who was watching us.

14:08.381 --> 14:09.716
Okay.

14:09.716 --> 14:11.284
Oddest first date ever.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.220
Sorry.

14:13.220 --> 14:16.356
Just meet me
in the security office.

14:20.060 --> 14:21.661
Oh, boy.

14:21.661 --> 14:22.963
Not how tonight
was supposed to go.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.531
I know.

14:24.531 --> 14:27.067
Madame Debuchy
was supposed to seduce

14:27.067 --> 14:29.702
Gustav into a torrid affair
in the kitchen.

14:29.702 --> 14:32.105
Gustav would've liked that.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.193
Cameras were disabled.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.894
The techs found
no fingerprints or DNA.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.130
Our guy was meticulous.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.398
And vicious.
What a way to go.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.000
Killer was lying in wait.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.969
Choked him from behind,

15:01.969 --> 15:03.570
obviously
with something sharp.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.138
Look at the wounds.

15:05.138 --> 15:06.539
The M.E. thinks
it was cheese wire--

15:06.539 --> 15:08.175
industrial strength, sharp.

15:08.175 --> 15:11.344
Cheese wire garrote?
That's... specific.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.013
Let me run it
through ViCAP.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.284
There were three homicides
in the last two years

15:17.284 --> 15:18.551
that fit the M.O.

15:18.551 --> 15:21.488
A-- Wait.
And one-- one attempted.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.690
Frank Patterson.
He survived.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.225
Where is he now?
In prison.

15:25.225 --> 15:28.395
Currently six months
into a three-year sentence

15:28.395 --> 15:30.430
for armed robbery.
Let's pay him a visit.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.802
How's it going?

15:35.802 --> 15:38.205
Wishing I hadn't
picked up my phone.

15:38.205 --> 15:41.208
I was having such a good night
until Garza called.

15:41.208 --> 15:43.710
Well, I do not want to hear
any more complaints from you.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.546
At least your girlfriend
is in the same time zone.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.716
Oh, you and Atlas are trying
the long-distance thing?

15:49.716 --> 15:52.219
Yeah. Phone sex isn't as good
as IRL.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.987
I don't know what I was thinking
bringing this up to you.

15:53.987 --> 15:55.522
No more talking. Please.

15:55.522 --> 15:56.789
All right.

15:58.791 --> 15:59.959
Oh, are you sure?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.561
Why?
You got something?

16:01.561 --> 16:03.063
Well, maybe.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.864
With the hat
and the camera angle,

16:04.864 --> 16:06.333
you can't do
facial recognition.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.500
Hmm.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.369
Ooh. Hold on.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.304
Yeah. That's a tattoo
on his right hand.

16:11.304 --> 16:14.074
But... I can't make out
what it is, though.

16:14.074 --> 16:16.076
Paid using
a credit card.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.844
Yep.
I'm calling for a warrant.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.649
It's midnight.
This better be good.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.884
Special Agents Hope
and Clark, FBI.

16:24.884 --> 16:27.987
Oh, so it's not just the heat.
I really am in hell.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.522
A man
was murdered tonight.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.059
Unless you're saying
I'm a suspect,

16:32.059 --> 16:33.560
why should I care?

16:33.560 --> 16:36.963
We think the same person
tried to kill you.

16:36.963 --> 16:38.898
Look familiar?

16:42.902 --> 16:46.206
If you arrest that bastard,
do me a favor--

16:46.206 --> 16:48.408
lock him up in here.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.709
I'll take care of the rest.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.444
That's not gonna happen.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.446
But you <i>can</i> help us
catch the guy.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.616
I'm not trying to wear a snitch
jacket, even for this guy.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.652
I just want to do my time
and go back home.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.987
To your family
in Florida?

17:00.987 --> 17:02.455
Because if you help us,

17:02.455 --> 17:05.058
we can secure a transfer
to a facility in-state.

17:05.058 --> 17:06.826
I'm listening.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.361
You're doing time
for jewelry theft,

17:08.361 --> 17:10.797
but they never recovered
the pieces.

17:10.797 --> 17:13.032
Did you have an accomplice,
someone who double-crossed you?

17:13.032 --> 17:16.969
I'm good.
Didn't need nobody else.

17:16.969 --> 17:19.872
And that job?
It was flawless.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.542
Was in and out
in five minutes.

17:22.542 --> 17:26.045
But when I got in the car,
someone was in back.

17:26.045 --> 17:28.315
Got a few licks in
before I blacked out.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.783
Never saw
the bastard's face.

17:30.783 --> 17:34.454
When I woke up,
I was cuffed in a hospital bed.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.156
Couldn't talk for weeks.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.891
Do you have any idea
who did this?

17:38.891 --> 17:41.661
I never tell anybody anything
about my scores.

17:41.661 --> 17:44.063
Who was the fence you were
going to? They had to know.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.732
I didn't give him
any details.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.368
I was careful.
Worked alone.

17:48.368 --> 17:50.570
Then that snake
snatches it all away.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.705
Not a snake.
A remora.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.507
A what?
A remora.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.176
It's also called
a suckerfish.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.678
They survive by suctioning
onto a host animal,

17:58.678 --> 18:00.480
like a shark or whale,

18:00.480 --> 18:02.449
then feed off its scraps
from its kills.

18:02.449 --> 18:06.219
So this guy lets a criminal
do all the work,

18:06.219 --> 18:09.856
then kills him
and takes the spoils.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.658
Hey, boss. Yeah.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.993
Our suspect was watching us
from the hotel lobby.

18:13.993 --> 18:15.962
Surveillance video caught him
using a credit card

18:15.962 --> 18:17.364
to buy coffee
and a dessert.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.998
Okay.
That get us a name?

18:18.998 --> 18:20.867
No. He was smart.
He used a prepaid credit card.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.303
But he also used it to rent
a ShareBNB in Echo Park.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.238
Ah.
So not so smart after all.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.639
Grab Carter and Simone.
Check it out.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.874

19:27.133 --> 19:29.336

So what?

19:29.336 --> 19:31.070
They liked my profile.
What does that really mean?

19:31.070 --> 19:33.373
It means you go out

19:34.907 --> 19:36.509

19:51.224 --> 19:53.960
Fortune! Hey!
I didn't know you worked here.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.564
Mm-hmm. Sorry for the delay,
but we are at capacity tonight.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.967
Heat-related illnesses,
accidents from downed power--

20:00.967 --> 20:02.902
the city goes nuts
when the temperature spikes.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.004
Uh, hi.
I'm Simone.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.206
How do you two
know each other?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.476
We've crossed paths
a few times.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.611
Tell her the truth.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.380
He arrested my mother
a while back.

20:13.380 --> 20:16.115
Jazmine
from Ventura County Jail.

20:16.115 --> 20:19.118
I remember her!
Feisty.

20:19.118 --> 20:21.954
To say the least.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.456
So, the doctor says
you're good to go.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.292
I'm just gonna
rewrap this.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.159
I promise to be gentle.

20:27.159 --> 20:28.995
Don't worry.
I can take it.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.234
Hey! Daddy, why are you up
so late?

20:35.234 --> 20:36.703
What's going on?

20:36.703 --> 20:38.671
<i>I'm guarding
the front door</i>

20:38.671 --> 20:41.508
<i>to keep Billie from sneaking
off to that boy's</i>

20:41.508 --> 20:43.610
van of iniquity.

20:43.610 --> 20:47.714
Billie is an adult, and she
needs to make all the mistakes

20:47.714 --> 20:50.450
that will turn her into
the woman she's meant to be.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.819
<i>What kind of mother
did I raise you to be?</i>

20:52.819 --> 20:55.388
A smart one.
I learned from the best.

20:55.388 --> 20:58.658
<i>And I'm doing the opposite of
what you and Mama did with me.</i>

20:58.658 --> 21:00.327
Now, what's that supposed
to mean?

21:00.327 --> 21:04.531
<i>Y'all gave me the blues
about everybody I brought home,</i>

21:04.531 --> 21:06.799
<i>and that only made me
like them even more.</i>

21:06.799 --> 21:09.369
The teenage brain
is naturally rebellious.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.804
It-- It cannot be
reasoned with.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.407
It requires
reverse psychology.

21:14.407 --> 21:17.944
<i>Okay. I get it.
So we're supposed to pretend</i>

21:17.944 --> 21:20.947
<i>that we like him
so that she'll stop liking him?</i>

21:20.947 --> 21:24.183
Yes. That's how we're gonna
get rid of him. He's a loser.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.353
Now, hold on.
He's not a loser.

21:26.353 --> 21:29.322
He's just a young man
finding himself.

21:29.322 --> 21:31.824
<i>But he's trying to date
my granddaughter,</i>

21:31.824 --> 21:35.362
<i>which means
he's got to go.</i>

21:35.362 --> 21:38.665
And he will.
Trust me, Daddy.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.534
Now get some sleep.

21:43.235 --> 21:44.971
Who knew tough G-men
could be ticklish?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.973
Well, you touch so soft,
how could I not be?

21:46.973 --> 21:49.676
Uh, should I step back out?

21:49.676 --> 21:52.178
I'm all done.

21:52.178 --> 21:55.348
And I am as good as new.
Boom! Thank you.

21:55.348 --> 21:58.718
I've got to run.
But if you need anything--

21:58.718 --> 22:02.188
anything at all--
find me.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.556
Nice seeing you again,
Agent Hope.

22:03.556 --> 22:05.057
You, too.
And call me Carter.

22:09.128 --> 22:12.031
So I guess we can delete
that dating app.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.199
I don't follow.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.502
If she threw it
at you any harder,

22:15.502 --> 22:17.570
you'd have a concussion.

22:17.570 --> 22:20.807
That girl is into you,
Mr. Analog Dater.

22:20.807 --> 22:23.543
What? Can't she just be
a kindhearted healthcare worker

22:23.543 --> 22:25.011
without you making it
all dirty?

22:25.011 --> 22:26.979
Hell no.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.481
She like you.

22:28.481 --> 22:30.683
Come on.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.051
How's the arm?

22:32.051 --> 22:33.653
Fine.
How's the case?

22:33.653 --> 22:36.989
Don't ask. Cronin went
tattletaling to the A.D.

22:36.989 --> 22:40.292
Said we lost this guy because I
didn't call SWAT in for backup.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.828
He just wants the case back
for himself.

22:41.828 --> 22:43.362
I'm sorry, Matt.
Don't be.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.631
It was my call.

22:44.631 --> 22:47.534
Well, it's still our case,
so let's work it.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.068
W-What did we miss?

22:49.068 --> 22:51.170
He used a fake name to set up
a ShareBNB account,

22:51.170 --> 22:52.705
but we have
no forensic evidence.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.340
Just a partial
palm print.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.208
We're-- We're no closer
to a positive I.D.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.777
Yeah. Well, we know more
about his victims

22:57.777 --> 22:59.646
than we do about him.

22:59.646 --> 23:02.482
All four are known criminals,
accomplished thieves--

23:02.482 --> 23:05.051
diamond theft, high-end cars,
pricy artwork.

23:05.051 --> 23:07.887
Exactly. Preys on his own kind,
just like a remora.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.288
Unh-unh.

23:09.288 --> 23:10.490
Stop trying to make
"remora" happen.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.524
It's not gonna.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.225
It's a fitting name
for our unsub.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.661
It totally fits his M.O.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.296
The metaphor doesn't even
make sense, Carter.

23:17.296 --> 23:19.699
A-A remora doesn't kill
its host animal.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.468
It just eats
its leftovers.

23:21.468 --> 23:23.135
Well, it's actually
scientifically proven

23:23.135 --> 23:24.571
that remoras feed
on their hosts' feces,

23:24.571 --> 23:26.405
not their kills.
You hear that?

23:26.405 --> 23:29.208
So unless you're calling
our spy satellite

23:29.208 --> 23:31.978
criminal excrement,
stop with "remora."

23:31.978 --> 23:34.547
Okay, well, hopefully we'll
learn this guy's real name

23:34.547 --> 23:36.716
once Cyber
gets into his burner cell,

23:36.716 --> 23:39.218
which won't be at least
until the morning
at the very earliest.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.153
So for right now,
everyone just go home.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.322
Get a few hours' rest.
Go.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.957
Don't.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.693
No. Simone,
y-y-you're missing <i>my</i> point.

23:46.693 --> 23:47.527
No.

23:52.832 --> 23:55.535
Oh.
You back to work already?

23:55.535 --> 23:57.236
Big case. I got to.

23:57.236 --> 24:00.239
And what about the case
of the man in the van?

24:00.239 --> 24:01.874
Follow my lead.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.776
Good morning, beautiful family!

24:03.776 --> 24:07.614
Hey. Where is that
cute boyfriend of yours?

24:07.614 --> 24:10.282
He's in his van-- where
Grandpa told him he had to stay.

24:10.282 --> 24:12.552
But it's good, 'cause he usually
sleeps till about noon anyways.

24:12.552 --> 24:15.588
Can't be mad at a man
who gets his beauty rest.

24:17.690 --> 24:22.629
Oh, a-a-and I've been thinking,
you know, about this ♪VanLife.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.331
He should be commended
for being eco-friendly.

24:25.331 --> 24:27.199
You want some coffee,
Daddy?

24:27.199 --> 24:30.469
Plus, just think of all
the money he's saving
living in his van--

24:30.469 --> 24:34.473
you know, on bills
and <i>re</i> responsibility.

24:34.473 --> 24:37.877
You know, I think, uh,
he just might be the one.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.979
Oh, I get it.
You two hate him.

24:39.979 --> 24:41.614
No.
It's not like that.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.183
You see a free spirit
living out of a van.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.052
I see someone who was there
for me this semester

24:46.052 --> 24:47.654
while I was struggling emotionally.

24:47.654 --> 24:52.324
He loves me and supports me,
and he makes me so happy.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.160
That's still
not good enough.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.629
I am happy Taylor
has been there for you.

24:56.629 --> 24:59.465
Honestly, I am.
But [chuckles] come on.

24:59.465 --> 25:02.201
I mean, the boy has nothing
going on with his life.

25:02.201 --> 25:04.503
How would you even know?
You've barely spoken to him.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.139
You know, Mom, when you were
a guidance counselor,

25:07.139 --> 25:08.975
you saw
the best in everyone.

25:08.975 --> 25:11.210
Now you're a Fed,
and you only see the worst.

25:11.210 --> 25:15.481
That is not tr--
Daddy, that's not true, right?

25:15.481 --> 25:18.484
It's not!
No, it's not true.

25:18.484 --> 25:20.519
But it's
not false, either.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.988
See?

25:21.988 --> 25:24.156
Look, your mother
just wants what's best.

25:24.156 --> 25:27.026
Same. And, you know, right now,
me being here is upsetting,

25:27.026 --> 25:28.327
so I think
I'm gonna leave.

25:28.327 --> 25:31.297
Okay.
Now you're overreacting.

25:31.297 --> 25:34.967
I love you, Mom,
but right now... I just can't.

25:34.967 --> 25:39.038
Daddy, do you hear sound
coming out of my mouth?

25:39.038 --> 25:42.174
'Cause it seems to me like
a little girl whose entire life

25:42.174 --> 25:45.311
I'm financing
is forgetting who she is

25:45.311 --> 25:47.947
and how things go up
and through here.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.281
You know,
I just need to clear my head.

25:49.281 --> 25:50.883
Good. Do it.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.052
And we'll talk about this
when I get home.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.655
Yeah.
I won't be here.

25:55.655 --> 25:56.488
Billie.

26:09.836 --> 26:11.370
Have I changed?

26:11.370 --> 26:12.672
What?

26:12.672 --> 26:15.307
Remember how I was
in the Academy on the first day?

26:15.307 --> 26:17.009
Am I the same person?

26:17.009 --> 26:18.377
No.
You're, uh-- You're better.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.712
No. I'm serious.

26:19.712 --> 26:21.547
Since being
in law enforcement,

26:21.547 --> 26:24.951
I'm-- I'm hunting serial
killers, going to crime scenes,

26:24.951 --> 26:27.353
i-interrogating folks,
and I think it's made me

26:27.353 --> 26:30.189
more judgmental--
biased, even.

26:30.189 --> 26:31.791
That's not who I am.

26:31.791 --> 26:34.794
Listen. I feel the same way,
too, sometimes.

26:34.794 --> 26:37.997
Sure.
We can't let this job
change us, B.

26:37.997 --> 26:39.699
We got to hold each other accountable,

26:39.699 --> 26:41.333
just like we did
at Quantico.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.340
Did we get anything
on the burner cell?

26:48.340 --> 26:50.142
Yeah.
The techs just sent it to us.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.811
He made three calls
on it, and the first two

26:51.811 --> 26:53.512
were to foreign consulates
here in L.A.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.781
Russia-- one-and-a-half-minute
phone call.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.282
China, a little less.

26:56.282 --> 26:57.717
Looks like they were trying
to off-load the tech

26:57.717 --> 26:59.318
to one of them.

26:59.318 --> 27:01.120
Yeah. But if you want
to do real business

27:01.120 --> 27:02.989
with a foreign power,
you contact the embassy in D.C.,

27:02.989 --> 27:04.691
not the consulate here
in Los Angeles.

27:04.691 --> 27:06.893
Maybe that's why the phone calls
are so short, right?

27:06.893 --> 27:08.995
I mean, what, are they calling
and asking to get transferred

27:08.995 --> 27:10.496
to the espionage office?

27:10.496 --> 27:12.331
Well, it does prove that
the unsub has the goods.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.233
He just doesn't know
how to go about selling them.

27:14.233 --> 27:15.567
The remora is used to piggybacking

27:15.567 --> 27:18.170
on other criminals' plans,
not creating his own.

27:18.170 --> 27:21.007
You called him the remora.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.275
What about this third call?
A Rebecca Laramie.

27:23.275 --> 27:26.879
R manager,
SonicSpeed Industries.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.715
What's that?
SonicSpeed Industries.

27:28.715 --> 27:32.118
That's Aerospace Relativity's
largest competitor.

27:32.118 --> 27:34.854
He's trying to sell
to their rival. Smart.

27:34.854 --> 27:37.356
Well, the call lasted
over seven minutes.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.358
That's more than enough time
to make a deal.

27:39.358 --> 27:40.960
Absolutely.
Let's get her in here right now.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.194
Yeah.

27:42.194 --> 27:43.996
Wait.
So this guy was for real?

27:43.996 --> 27:45.664
Yes, Ms. Laramie,
he was.

27:45.664 --> 27:47.867
Okay. So it wasn't Todd
in accounting pranking me?

27:47.867 --> 27:49.668
Oh, come on. You were
on the phone with him
for seven minutes.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.070
I look at spreadsheets
all day.

27:51.070 --> 27:52.171
This was the highlight
of my morning.

27:52.171 --> 27:53.572
Okay.
Did the caller

27:53.572 --> 27:55.374
try and sell you top-secret
satellite info

27:55.374 --> 27:56.843
from
Aerospace Relativity?

27:56.843 --> 27:59.378
If I knew this was real,
I would have taken him up on it.

27:59.378 --> 28:00.880
It would've got me
a big promotion.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.816
And a prison sentence.
This isn't a joke.

28:03.816 --> 28:05.818
This is espionage.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.319
Wait.
Am I in trouble?

28:07.319 --> 28:09.488
We need you to tell us
everything he said to you.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.891
Oh. Well, you can listen
to the call yourself.

28:11.891 --> 28:13.625
The company records
all our calls.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.995
<i>What I have to show you
is worth your time.</i>

28:15.995 --> 28:18.731
<i>How about we meet in two hours
at Angels Gate in San Pedro?</i>

28:18.731 --> 28:20.066
Ms. Laramie didn't agree
to the meeting,

28:20.066 --> 28:21.734
but Simone has a theory.

28:21.734 --> 28:23.903
My grandmother grew up
in San Pedro.

28:23.903 --> 28:27.506
Fort MacArthur Battery Barlow
is an old bunker there.

28:27.506 --> 28:30.042
It has graffiti all over it.
It's actually pretty cool.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.510
And I'm interested why,
Simone?

28:31.510 --> 28:33.345
Because he called it
"Angels Gate,"

28:33.345 --> 28:35.481
and only locals
call it that.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.884
So it got me thinking,
maybe he grew up around there.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.318
It's pretty thin,
but it's what we got.

28:39.318 --> 28:40.719
So what do we know?

28:40.719 --> 28:42.521
Most criminals don't start out
as murderers.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.656
They usually build themselves up
one felony at a time.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.993
So chances are,
our unsub has a criminal record.

28:46.993 --> 28:48.660
Well,
let's take a look.

28:48.660 --> 28:51.397
Male, Black.

28:51.397 --> 28:54.300
You said 25 to 30?
Make it 35.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.235
Oh, and don't forget that
the hotel surveillance

28:56.235 --> 28:58.204
showed that he has
a tattoo on his right hand.

28:58.204 --> 29:01.340
Okay. Now, any former
or current address

29:01.340 --> 29:04.844
in San Pedro, California.

29:04.844 --> 29:07.513
Okay. Five possibles.

29:07.513 --> 29:09.548
Carter, you were up close
and personal with this guy.

29:09.548 --> 29:10.449
Is he in there?

29:15.321 --> 29:16.355
That's him.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.024
Yeah?

29:18.024 --> 29:20.292
Trevor Bask.

29:20.292 --> 29:21.560
He did time for breaking
and entering.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.295
Got out two years ago.
Fits the profile.

29:23.295 --> 29:24.330
Put out a BOLO,
check aliases,

29:24.330 --> 29:25.731
and contact
all known associates.

29:25.731 --> 29:27.466
We are close, team.

29:29.001 --> 29:30.069
Hey.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.171
Yes?

29:32.171 --> 29:34.440
If that's not
how you greeted everyone,

29:34.440 --> 29:36.642
a guy might think
he did something wrong.

29:36.642 --> 29:39.345
Interrupting my workflow may or
may not fall into that category.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.647
Well, it might be
for a good reason.

29:41.647 --> 29:43.883
I'd like to reset
our first date.

29:45.384 --> 29:46.652
What did you have
in mind?

29:46.652 --> 29:48.554
Well, tonight,
I was thinking

29:48.554 --> 29:52.624
maybe we could do
Spanish food at La Fonda,

29:52.624 --> 29:57.163
followed by a romantic, star-lit
stroll at the observatory,

29:57.163 --> 29:58.965
and maybe some dancing
at the Warwick.

29:58.965 --> 30:00.632
Ambitious.
Yeah.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.734
And impressive.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.803
I'm very much on board. Great.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.706
But... isn't it a gamble
with an active case

30:07.706 --> 30:09.708
and your
unpredictable hours?

30:09.708 --> 30:12.611
Ah, maybe.
But I bet on us.

30:12.611 --> 30:13.980
Okay.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.547
Then I'm in.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.283
Okay.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.484
We got
a facial recognition hit

30:18.484 --> 30:20.286
on Trevor Bask
from a traffic cam.

30:20.286 --> 30:21.954
Let's move. Yeah.

30:21.954 --> 30:23.455
Uh, I'll see you tonight.

30:23.455 --> 30:25.391
Okay.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.370
Hey, buddy.

30:38.370 --> 30:42.174
Pete. Been a while. Yeah.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.642
I appreciate you doing
this so last-minute.

30:43.642 --> 30:45.811
Oh. No problem.

30:45.811 --> 30:47.846
Why the urgency?

30:47.846 --> 30:50.649
I got a lot of heat on me, man.
I got to get out of the country.

30:50.649 --> 30:52.684
But I'm not trying to go
with empty pockets.

30:52.684 --> 30:56.522
Yeah. Well, it's a good thing
I brought this, then, huh?

30:56.522 --> 30:58.290
Yeah.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.492
Just, uh,
one question first.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.398
Were you the one
who killed that engineer...

31:06.398 --> 31:08.667
strung a wire
around his neck?

31:27.987 --> 31:29.721
LAPD canvassed the area.

31:29.721 --> 31:31.523
A man fitting Trevor's
description went inside

31:31.523 --> 31:34.026
about 10 minutes ago and he was
carrying the messenger bag.

31:34.026 --> 31:35.561
He's gonna try to sell
the plans.

31:35.561 --> 31:36.963
Let's move.

31:56.815 --> 31:58.117
No one's here.

31:58.117 --> 31:59.185
He couldn't
have gone far.

31:59.185 --> 32:01.120
Simone, what is it?

32:01.120 --> 32:03.222
Found him.

32:15.101 --> 32:17.503
So Trevor set up a deal
to sell the satellite R

32:17.503 --> 32:19.071
but got double-crossed
by the buyer,

32:19.071 --> 32:20.806
who killed him
and took the tech.

32:20.806 --> 32:22.374
Don't say it.
What?

32:22.374 --> 32:24.276
That the remora
got remora'ed.

32:24.276 --> 32:26.445
I wasn't going to.
But it's true.

32:26.445 --> 32:27.879
And the fact that you said it
lets us all know

32:27.879 --> 32:29.648
how fitting
the name "remora" is.

32:29.648 --> 32:32.451
Is it just me or is this
an odd way to kill someone?

32:32.451 --> 32:34.620
Gunshot to the stomach
and then strangulation

32:34.620 --> 32:36.455
using the victim's
own garrote.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.225
Well, gunshot was meant to
immobilize Trevor, not kill him.

32:39.225 --> 32:43.062
The unsub wanted to take
his time, kill him slowly.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.696
This murder
was purposeful.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.733
So shoots him in the stomach.
That way, he can't fight back.

32:47.733 --> 32:51.203
And he fishes around, finds
Trevor's own weapon of choice,

32:51.203 --> 32:53.139
and finishes him off
with that.

32:53.139 --> 32:54.640
That's cold.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.809
This was about more than
stealing the satellite tech,

32:57.809 --> 32:59.145
wasn't it?

32:59.145 --> 33:00.279
Yeah. It's personal.

33:00.279 --> 33:03.015
Trevor and this new unsub
have a history.

33:03.015 --> 33:05.984
And that's the way we're going
to I.D. whoever did this.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.020
We're gonna have to tear
Trevor's life apart

33:08.020 --> 33:10.822
and figure out who had
the most hate-on for him.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.558
Let's just hope we can
before they sell the tech.

33:12.558 --> 33:13.859
Come on. Yeah.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.197
I think I got something.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.166
I did a deep dive
on Trevor Bask.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.733
<i>Take a look at his
known associates.</i>

33:21.733 --> 33:22.801
All right. Which one?

33:22.801 --> 33:24.970
Peter McCord,
his cellmate?

33:24.970 --> 33:26.505
That's the one.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.774
They shared a cell
in Pelican Bay for two years.

33:28.774 --> 33:31.310
Now, McCord is a fence
and a known trafficker

33:31.310 --> 33:33.479
of high-end items
for an international clientele.

33:33.479 --> 33:36.315
So maybe Trevor got McCord
to sell their secrets?

33:36.315 --> 33:37.783
But why would McCord
kill him

33:37.783 --> 33:38.850
if they were doing business
together?

33:38.850 --> 33:40.152
I know why.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.354
In McCord's
list of known associates

33:42.354 --> 33:44.156
<i>is Jared Mackey,</i>

33:44.156 --> 33:46.325
<i>who stole a shipment
of rare metals,</i>

33:46.325 --> 33:49.528
and Fernando Pierce,
who pulled a heist at MoMA.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.163
Those names
sound familiar?

33:51.163 --> 33:52.898
Both were garroted after
they pulled their jobs.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.200
And McCord
was their fence?

33:54.200 --> 33:55.534
Looks that way.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.403
So tell me
if this makes sense.

33:57.403 --> 34:00.472
After sharing a prison cell and
figuring out what McCord does,

34:00.472 --> 34:02.308
<i>Trevor gets an idea.</i>

34:02.308 --> 34:04.009
Right. Why risk pulling
a heist yourself

34:04.009 --> 34:05.611
when you can piggyback
other people's heists

34:05.611 --> 34:06.945
and just rob them?

34:06.945 --> 34:10.382
Yeah. So Trevor follows
McCord's associates around

34:10.382 --> 34:11.617
until they perform
their jobs...

34:11.617 --> 34:13.185
Like a remora.

34:13.185 --> 34:15.154
<i>...then kills them
and takes the stolen goods</i>

34:15.154 --> 34:18.157
for himself and sells them
through a different fence.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.558
But if he was screwing over McCord,

34:19.558 --> 34:21.460
why would he have him fence
the stolen secrets?

34:21.460 --> 34:23.395
Well,
because Trevor got cocky

34:23.395 --> 34:25.664
and figured McCord
wasn't onto his scheme.

34:25.664 --> 34:27.233
And he needed a guy
who could give him a big payday

34:27.233 --> 34:28.800
for those secrets.

34:28.800 --> 34:30.702
That backfired in a big way
'cause Spencer Gordon's death

34:30.702 --> 34:32.338
is all over the news.

34:32.338 --> 34:34.673
It's the same M.O. as who hit
four of his known associates--

34:34.673 --> 34:36.007
McCord got wise.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.043
So when Trevor called
with the tech to sell,

34:38.043 --> 34:40.612
McCord realized he could
get revenge <i>and</i> a big payday.

34:40.612 --> 34:41.713
Where can we look
for McCord?

34:41.713 --> 34:44.049
There are
seven known addresses

34:44.049 --> 34:45.684
spread out
over Los Angeles--

34:45.684 --> 34:47.786
one residence,
six businesses.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.522
So, Laura, Brendon, why don't
you take the home in K-Town?

34:50.522 --> 34:53.392
Carter and Simone, hit up
this pawn shop in Hollywood.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.294
I'll coordinate with LAPD
and get them to cover

39:34.973 --> 39:38.309
Professionally? Yeah.
Personally?

39:38.309 --> 39:40.045
You already know
the answer to that.

39:40.045 --> 39:41.813
I called Billie.

39:41.813 --> 39:43.615
For two hours,
I tried to convince her

39:43.615 --> 39:46.151
to have that boy
turn that house van around

39:46.151 --> 39:48.487
so that y'all
could work things out.

39:48.487 --> 39:51.122
Well, thank you for trying, Daddy,

39:51.122 --> 39:53.725
but I'm gonna go
call her myself.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.694
You don't have to.

39:59.698 --> 40:03.401
Okay. Now, as-- as a guy
who spent eight years

40:03.401 --> 40:06.371
away from the people he loves,
I'm not with

40:06.371 --> 40:10.008
that "stomp out angry
and not speaking" thing.

40:10.008 --> 40:12.678
Not in this family.

40:12.678 --> 40:15.881
We can disagree
and need space,

40:15.881 --> 40:18.550
but we don't stop talking.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.886
So... talk.

40:22.387 --> 40:25.223
Thank you, Daddy.

40:25.223 --> 40:27.358
And thank you
for coming back.

40:27.358 --> 40:29.495
I don't have
a lot of time.

40:29.495 --> 40:30.896
Taylor's putting gas
in the van,

40:30.896 --> 40:32.631
and I got to get back
to school.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.299
Okay. Well, then let me
make it quick.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.301
You were right.

40:36.301 --> 40:39.137
I judged Taylor before I had
a chance to get to know him.

40:39.137 --> 40:41.006
He's a great guy.

40:41.006 --> 40:44.309
And I'm looking forward to
getting to know that for myself.

40:44.309 --> 40:47.546
But if he ever treats you badly,
you know who to call.

40:47.546 --> 40:50.115
Yeah. Grandpa.

40:50.115 --> 40:51.316
You can be a little too much sometimes.

40:53.485 --> 40:58.223
And... I want to apologize
for my attitude earlier.

40:58.223 --> 40:59.491
I was out of line.

40:59.491 --> 41:01.560
Well, that's okay.

41:01.560 --> 41:04.162
I chalk it up to you being
around them Berkeley kids

41:04.162 --> 41:06.464
a little too long.

41:06.464 --> 41:08.800
But I'm glad you realized.

41:08.800 --> 41:12.303
And I-I want to say sorry
for saying you changed

41:12.303 --> 41:16.007
when you haven't.
No. I <i>have</i> changed.

41:16.007 --> 41:17.776
But I'm working on it.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.044
And you've changed, too.

41:19.044 --> 41:21.346
You don't need my input
in your life anymore.

41:21.346 --> 41:23.348
Sure I do.

41:23.348 --> 41:25.551
Just only
when I ask for it.

41:27.185 --> 41:29.855
Okay. You got it. Promise.

41:29.855 --> 41:33.124
Oh.

41:33.124 --> 41:35.961
It's Taylor.
He's out back.

41:35.961 --> 41:37.295
I love you.

41:37.295 --> 41:38.564
I love you, too.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.201
Hey, don't forget to call
when you get there.

41:45.270 --> 41:48.940
Does parenting
ever get easier, Daddy?

41:48.940 --> 41:52.510
You want the truth?

41:52.510 --> 41:53.845
Or do you want me to just be
a father

41:53.845 --> 41:55.881
and make you feel better?

41:57.248 --> 41:58.950
The feel-better one.
