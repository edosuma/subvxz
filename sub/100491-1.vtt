You know, they say people 
in glass houses

00:37.171 --> 00:40.105
should throw stones, but
I think people in any type

00:40.107 --> 00:41.807

throw a stone.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.320

00:43.321 --> 00:44.832
about like the glass
windows or anything.

00:44.833 --> 00:46.344

stones at people?

getting these stones?

00:48.516 --> 00:49.782

really a fiesta

00:56.624 --> 00:59.124

give me a hand-job.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.571
That was probably my peak.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.706

be a hand-job.

hang out with her?

07:10.697 --> 07:12.531
I don't need there to be 
any weird tension.

07:12.533 --> 07:16.034

around you.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.604

with me being there?

07:19.606 --> 07:20.689
Are you...

07:20.690 --> 07:21.773
Like, Owen should
fucking love me.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.208
If I didn't skip town
like an asshole,

07:23.210 --> 07:25.077
he never would've gotten
married to Becks.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.945
See, now that skip town
like an asshole comment

07:26.947 --> 07:28.046
is what concerns me.

- Owen would be uncomfortable?
- Yes.

07:30.717 --> 07:31.983

to be a dick.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.585

07:33.587 --> 07:34.653

Right.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.161
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.029

07:46.533 --> 07:48.250
- What?
- No.

07:48.251 --> 07:49.968
I mean, did you get your
own pee on you?

07:49.970 --> 07:52.571
No, I'm fine, please stop 
looking at my penis.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.707
- Yeah, all right.

call you a cab?

08:07.621 --> 08:09.087
What?

08:09.088 --> 08:10.554
Listen, do you want
me to call you a taxi?

08:10.557 --> 08:12.724
Sorry, I don't need a
taxi 'cause I have the Lyft.

08:12.726 --> 08:13.525
You have Lyft?

08:13.527 --> 08:15.060
Lyft is unbelievable

08:15.061 --> 08:16.594
'cause you don't have
to know where you are.

08:16.597 --> 08:17.762
You know, you just hit the thing

08:17.764 --> 08:19.865
and a guy from another
country comes

08:19.867 --> 08:22.601
and takes you right home,
it's like magic.

08:22.603 --> 08:24.503
But you do know 
where you are?

08:24.505 --> 08:25.237
When?

08:25.239 --> 08:26.538
Right now.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.673
Now?

08:27.674 --> 08:28.807
Do you know where 
you are right now?

08:28.809 --> 08:30.842
- Yes.
- Okay, tell me.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.177
- Where are you?
- Here.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.980
- Oh my goodness.
- Whoa, hey, that's no good.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.048
What are you doing?

08:36.049 --> 08:37.115
What, no, no, no, I'm sorry.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.717
- Look, I know what this is.
- Okay.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.119
I got a guy, he'll help you.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.520
He's on the corner of
Walnut and Laurel--

08:42.523 --> 08:44.823
Hey, hey, hey, for the last time,

08:44.825 --> 08:46.925
don't bother the customers.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.226
I'm sorry about him.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.928
You're good, you're good,
it's fine.

08:49.930 --> 08:52.264
We're just two guys talking
skin conditions, taking pisses.

08:52.266 --> 08:53.798
Yeah, 
I'm not bothering anybody.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.033
Oh, you think you're cute,
huh?

08:55.035 --> 08:57.002
No, I don't think I'm cute, okay?

08:57.004 --> 08:58.203
I know I'm adorable.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.493
Yeah?

08:59.494 --> 09:00.782
- This guy loves me.
- Really?

09:00.783 --> 09:02.071
- He pissed in the sink.
- I didn't piss in the sink.

09:02.075 --> 09:03.775
- I saw him.
- He literally just did it.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.912
- He went on his tippy toes.
- I saw you.

09:06.914 --> 09:07.846
What?

09:34.608 --> 09:39.678
(blanket rustling)
(Scott grunting)

09:58.198 --> 09:59.831
Hey, Scotty.

09:59.833 --> 10:00.999
How'd you sleep?

10:01.001 --> 10:03.068
You need anything in here,
more pillows?

10:03.070 --> 10:04.669
No, I'm fine, Mom.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.072
And honestly, you didn't
have to keep all this stuff.

10:07.074 --> 10:07.906
Oh, what stuff?

10:07.908 --> 10:09.274
What stuff?

10:09.275 --> 10:10.641
Look at this, my VHS collection.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.077
Honey, you really need
to have someone

10:12.079 --> 10:13.745
take a look at those.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.880
I will, I will, I will, I will.

10:15.882 --> 10:16.948
Should just change
this room into,

10:16.950 --> 10:18.883
like, Dad's office or something.

10:18.885 --> 10:20.952
Well, he already has an office.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.220
Speaking of which--
Don't, please don't, okay?

10:22.222 --> 10:23.972
Meg already asked me about it.

10:23.973 --> 10:25.723
I'm not gonna work back at
the lumberyard, all right?

10:25.726 --> 10:27.626
Okay, good, because your
father and I talked about it

10:27.628 --> 10:28.827
and he doesn't think
it's a good idea.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.562
Seriously?

10:30.563 --> 10:32.296
Honey, you know how he felt 
about you leaving.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.633
He always figured you'd run 
the place one day.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.701
He figured I would 
run the place.

10:36.703 --> 10:38.937
That's the word we should be 
looking at, he.

10:40.641 --> 10:42.841
You know when I came home
yesterday, he just shook my

10:42.843 --> 10:44.743
hand? He didn't even get up
out of his chair.

10:44.745 --> 10:45.977
He just gave me a handshake.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.780
You know how he is.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.281
Just give him some time.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.934
Oh.

10:52.935 --> 10:54.184
And I like your room
the way it is.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.987
Figured if you'd need it,
it's here.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.857
Wow, not a lot of faith in 
my career decision huh, Ma?

10:58.859 --> 11:00.859
Oh, just so you know,
this morning,

11:00.861 --> 11:03.194
I printed out that
mailman application.

11:03.196 --> 11:05.830
Why are you so psyched 
about that?

11:06.933 --> 11:08.166
[Jeanine] Woo.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.400
Mom, I don't wanna
be a mailman.

11:09.403 --> 11:12.270
(chair whirring)

11:18.078 --> 11:19.010
Oh.

11:20.414 --> 11:21.346
Oh.

11:23.750 --> 11:24.849
Oh, don't do it.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.284
It's a fun chair, isn't it?

11:28.121 --> 11:30.388
You gotta be fucking 
kidding me.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.268
I'm sorry.

11:32.269 --> 11:34.147
When you said 
you knew a guy,

11:34.148 --> 11:36.026
I had no idea that you were 
going to be that guy.

11:36.997 --> 11:38.797
Bathroom the other night?

11:38.799 --> 11:39.831
Oh, at the bar.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.967
At the bar in the bathroom.

11:41.968 --> 11:44.102
Oh yeah, listen, it's been
a very crazy day here today.

11:44.104 --> 11:46.705
- So, yeah, oh yeah.
- Wow.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.940
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.342
All right, so what do 
we got going on?

11:51.344 --> 11:54.946
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, 
I don't know what they're from,

11:54.948 --> 11:56.347
maybe an allergic
reaction to something.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.216
Maybe a new detergent,
but I can't get 'em away.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.251
Yeah.

11:59.252 --> 12:00.285
Have you been putting
anything on it?

12:00.287 --> 12:01.219
- Yeah.
- Let me guess.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.387
[Both] Hydrocortisone.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.354
And it did...

12:03.356 --> 12:04.856
[Both] Nothing.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.157
Yeah.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.425
Are you currently
sexually active?

12:07.427 --> 12:09.761
- What?
- Sexually active.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.129
You think there's an
STD on my arm?

12:11.131 --> 12:12.714
Well, you know.

12:12.715 --> 12:14.298
No, I haven't been going
around fisting strangers.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.067
I don't just find somebody
and stick my entire...

12:16.069 --> 12:18.470
That would be my entire
fucking forearm in there.

12:19.372 --> 12:20.530
- Okay.
- Sorry.

12:20.531 --> 12:21.689
- Yeah.
- That's good to know.

12:21.690 --> 12:22.848
- Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:22.849 --> 12:24.007
It's just a question I have 
to ask, that's all.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.076
- Yeah.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.010
Um.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.947
No, I haven't had sex in awhile.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.248
I haven't had sex in
like a couple--

12:30.250 --> 12:31.483
Okay, okay.

12:31.485 --> 12:32.834
Duly noted.

12:32.835 --> 12:34.184
I'm gonna take a look, all right?

12:34.187 --> 12:35.186
Does kissing count?

12:35.188 --> 12:36.855
If I, does kissing count?

12:36.857 --> 12:38.223
It depends on where you kiss,
I guess.

12:38.225 --> 12:39.758
(laughs)

12:39.760 --> 12:40.492
Let me see.

12:42.963 --> 12:43.895
Hm.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.398
Maybe you should be
sexually active.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.469
Those are good old-fashioned 
stress hives.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.438
You can get hives from stress?

12:53.439 --> 12:55.406
Oh, you'd be shocked at what
stress can do to the skin.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.076
It can play havoc with
your integumentary system.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.978
- That's a big word.
- That's why I have the chair.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.263
(both laughing)

13:01.264 --> 13:02.547
No, integumentary is 
a fantastic word,

13:02.549 --> 13:04.783
but just basically means skin.

13:04.785 --> 13:07.886
My daughter went through a bad 
divorce a couple years ago

13:07.888 --> 13:10.522
and she had the exact same
reaction, the stress hive.

13:10.524 --> 13:12.524
You see the zigzag
pattern there?

13:12.526 --> 13:14.058
- Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
- Yeah, exact same.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.311
Stress hives.

13:16.312 --> 13:18.563
Yeah, or you could be dying 
of 30, 40 diseases.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.064
- Who knows?
- Oh, thank you for that.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.399
Really helps my stress levels.

13:21.401 --> 13:23.134
- Oh, so you are under stress.
- Oh my god.

13:23.136 --> 13:26.871
- Profoundly so, yeah.
- Oh.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.873
- Why?
- Really?

13:28.875 --> 13:30.041
[Marty] What's going on?

13:32.045 --> 13:33.011
You don't have the time.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.445
Oh, but I do have the time.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.181
Believe me, 
I got plenty of time today.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.100
I just checked my sign-in sheet

13:38.101 --> 13:40.018
and the next patient coming
in has a terrible rash

13:40.020 --> 13:43.988
on his scrotum that I have
to apply a topical suave to.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.257
Plus, he looks like the human 
version of Eeyore.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.592
The whole thing is 
a total nightmare.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.294
So believe me, 
I have nothing but time.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.029
Are you even allowed
to tell me any of that?

13:51.031 --> 13:52.330
Are you even a dermatologist?

13:52.332 --> 13:54.265
I don't see a degree
anywhere on any wall.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.568
I graduated from the
University of Phoenix.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.269
I took two online classes.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.571
Both of 'em, you took
both online classes?

13:59.573 --> 14:01.089
[Marty] Yeah.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.606
The fact that I can't tell
if you're kidding or not

14:02.609 --> 14:05.009
does not make me very confident
in your whole diagnosis.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.594
No, no no no, now, listen.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.178
I'm gonna prescribe a topical 
steroid for you.

14:08.181 --> 14:11.099
Ah.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.018
I actually am on the whole
self-pay thing.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.287
So is there any shot this
will just disappear by itself?

14:16.289 --> 14:20.425
Because my insurance is not
really robust or existing.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.126
Yeah, okay.

14:22.128 --> 14:23.328
(speaking in foreign language)

14:23.330 --> 14:25.964
As the French say,
lovely parting gift.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.398
Twice a day, morning
and evening.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.467
Keep it dry in between, okay?

14:29.469 --> 14:31.202
And if they come back,
I want you to call me.

14:31.204 --> 14:32.136
Yeah.

14:32.138 --> 14:33.338
And try to relax.

14:33.339 --> 14:34.539
Because once when you start 
feeling overwhelmed--

14:34.541 --> 14:36.007
That's what it is.

14:36.008 --> 14:37.474
That's exactly what
I've been feeling.

14:37.477 --> 14:40.511
I just feel so overwhelmed.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.247
Aren't we all, Mr.
Rollins, aren't we all?

14:42.249 --> 14:43.915
- Hey, man, I appreciate it.
- Mm-mm.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.216
- Yep, I shouldn't touch you.
- No.

14:45.218 --> 14:48.052
Okay.
(Marty laughs)

14:49.122 --> 14:50.421
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.527
- Mr. Herman, how are you?
- Hey, doc.

14:56.529 --> 14:58.897
[Marty] Go on back,
good to see you, pal.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.502
(pleasant music)

15:04.504 --> 15:05.436
Okay.

15:13.013 --> 15:16.014
(brakes squealing)

15:18.018 --> 15:20.685
(batter hissing)

15:37.037 --> 15:38.569
[TV Announcer] Ball one.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.138
One away, second and eight.

15:40.140 --> 15:41.572
Red Sox, two, Mets, nothing.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.374
On deck, Ray Knight.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.982
[Woman] God, 
I can't believe this.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.587
[Howard] Give me a break.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.057
(Howard squawks)

15:59.059 --> 16:00.224
I'm so nervous.

16:00.226 --> 16:04.128
It's just that I've never
been around a...

16:04.130 --> 16:06.564
I mean, I've never even had 
a pet sort of thing, you know,

16:06.566 --> 16:08.066
always seemed like
such a hassle.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.501
- You know, feeding 'em.
- Scotty.

16:10.503 --> 16:11.703
Dinner.

16:11.705 --> 16:12.921
All right.

16:12.922 --> 16:14.138
[Howard] Try to be careful.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.741
(phone beeping)

16:21.648 --> 16:24.449
(phone ringing)

16:26.720 --> 16:28.686
[Adam] Hi, this is Adam, 
I can't make it to the phone.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.088
Please leave a message.

16:30.991 --> 16:33.091
Hey, Adam, it's me.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.559
Yeah, I'm sitting at home
tonight and guess what's

16:34.561 --> 16:39.664
on the TV, the 1986 World
Series, right?

16:39.666 --> 16:41.666
Mets versus the Red Sox,
remember?

16:41.668 --> 16:43.634
We watched like every
game together.

16:43.636 --> 16:47.672
You were like five and you loved 
that pitcher, Ron Darling.

16:49.009 --> 16:51.609
Oh, and I made my famous
blueberry pancakes.

16:51.611 --> 16:52.911
Yeah.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.212
Remember how when 
we went camping,

16:54.214 --> 16:57.348
I always used to make
the blueberry pancakes

16:57.350 --> 16:59.617
that somehow would always
seem like it was raining?

16:59.619 --> 17:01.086
Remember that?

17:01.087 --> 17:02.554
Oh god.

17:02.555 --> 17:04.021
You and your sister just
loved those pancakes.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.757
- Anyway--
- Message length exceeded.

17:05.759 --> 17:08.425
(phone beeps)

17:12.365 --> 17:15.032
(Marty sighs)

17:17.404 --> 17:20.204
(phone beeping)

17:22.075 --> 17:23.808
(phone ringing)

17:23.810 --> 17:25.777
[Adam] Hi, this is Adam, 
I can't make it to the phone.

17:25.779 --> 17:26.743
Please leave a message.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.514
I know you're not
gonna call me back.

17:29.516 --> 17:31.349
But I have to say it.

17:31.351 --> 17:33.151
Please, call me back.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.386
I mean, your sister gets
on the phone when I call

17:35.388 --> 17:37.555
and, you know, sometimes
she'll humor me

17:37.557 --> 17:40.425
and we'll stay on for
like 10 minutes or so,

17:40.427 --> 17:42.260
you know, 
if you can imagine that.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.596
That's really all I'm looking for.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.399
You know, 
just a couple of minutes.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.336
But if you wanna keep playing
this game of phone chicken,

17:52.338 --> 17:53.704
then I'm in.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.074
I'll call you, you'll ignore me.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.476
I'll call you, you'll ignore me.

17:58.478 --> 18:01.546
And then we'll see which
one of us gives in first.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.748
- So anyway--
- Message length exceeded.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.417
(phone beeps)

18:16.596 --> 18:17.862
(Marty sighs)

18:17.864 --> 18:18.729
This is nice.

18:18.731 --> 18:20.231
Isn't this nice?

18:20.233 --> 18:21.699
Damn good yard bird, Jeanine.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.868
No, I mean 
the whole family's here.

18:23.870 --> 18:26.104
Both my little birdies in the nest.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.372
Do you know, I read somewhere 
that if a bird stays

18:28.374 --> 18:30.608
in the nest, it means
it has mental problems.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.311
That's how you can tell if
a bird isn't gonna make it.

18:33.313 --> 18:34.245
Well, that's interesting.

18:34.247 --> 18:35.780
I thought so too, Mom.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.314
- You know what I read?
- You can read?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.317
Oh my god, 
that's such a funny joke.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.718
You should tell it again
for your number one fan

18:40.720 --> 18:42.353
who's sitting right here,
your mother.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.422
I'm not ashamed that my mom 
is my number one fan.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.823
Only fan, by the way.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.558
We're having a, stop it,
stop it.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.193
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
can we just--

18:49.195 --> 18:50.661
Stop it, both of you.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.673
I was wondering if it's okay

19:01.674 --> 19:03.608
if Ruis comes over for
dinner next weekend.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.675
Absolutely.

19:04.677 --> 19:05.543
Ruis is awesome.

19:05.545 --> 19:06.661
That can't be true.

19:06.662 --> 19:07.778
How do you know if
it's true or not?

19:07.780 --> 19:09.405
You've never even met him.

19:09.406 --> 19:11.031
I don't need to meet him

19:11.032 --> 19:12.657
because I've met all
your other boyfriends.

19:12.658 --> 19:14.283
Remember the guy whose job
it was to play online poker?

19:14.287 --> 19:16.287
Or do you remember the guy
who always wore jean shorts?

19:16.289 --> 19:19.390
Every single, Mom, every single
day, he wore jean shorts.

19:19.392 --> 19:21.893
Do you remember the one
that looked like Kid Rock?

19:21.895 --> 19:23.394
He didn't look anything
like Kid Rock.

19:23.396 --> 19:24.562
I apologize, he looked
like Uncle Kracker.

19:24.564 --> 19:26.931
(both laughing)
See?

19:26.932 --> 19:29.299
Even Dad and Mom liked that,
my number one fan is laughing.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.902
- Thank you, Mom.
- Whatever.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.570
- He did.
- Ruis is awesome.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.905
- Eat a dick.
- Wow.

19:33.907 --> 19:35.473
Meg, language.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.775
Scotty, we do not
make fun of Ruis.

19:37.777 --> 19:38.793
Really?

19:38.794 --> 19:39.810
That's a rule in this house now?

19:39.812 --> 19:41.812
We can't use Ruis's
name in vain?

19:41.814 --> 19:43.614
What is he, Voldemort?

19:43.616 --> 19:44.749
He's awesome.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.683
Thank you, Dad.

19:50.256 --> 19:53.558
Oh, Scotty, did you hear 
about Rory Seidel?

19:53.560 --> 19:55.259
Who's Rory Seidel?

19:55.261 --> 19:56.460
You went to school with him.

19:56.462 --> 19:58.429
He used to work at Carvel's,
remember?

19:58.431 --> 20:00.014
Yes.

20:00.015 --> 20:01.598
I remember Rory, 
that fucking weirdo.

20:01.601 --> 20:02.567
Why, what happened?

20:02.569 --> 20:04.435
He died.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.571
It's so sad, he was only 32.

20:08.341 --> 20:09.674
God, I remember that guy.

20:11.744 --> 20:13.811
[Jeanine] Weren't you
friends with him?

20:13.813 --> 20:16.681
I wasn't friends with him, 
no, but Becky was.

20:17.951 --> 20:18.816
(somber music)

20:18.818 --> 20:21.886
(people whispering)

20:55.688 --> 20:57.355
Pst, hey, Rollins, right?

20:57.357 --> 20:58.022
Rollins.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.290
Hey, how you doing?

20:59.292 --> 21:00.291
Are you everywhere?

21:00.293 --> 21:01.292
I get around.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.327
What are you doing here?

21:04.764 --> 21:06.430
Honestly, I don't even know.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.466
Wow.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.968
What?

21:09.969 --> 21:11.469
- You killed Rory.
- I didn't kill Rory.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.703
That's why you were stressed.

21:12.705 --> 21:13.804
What are you doing?

21:13.805 --> 21:14.904
That's your hand on his shoulder

21:14.907 --> 21:16.440
right before you strangled him.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.609
Rory died of, don't,
he died of leukemia.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.547
Are you high?

21:23.549 --> 21:25.283
Yeah.

21:25.285 --> 21:26.017
Wow.

21:26.019 --> 21:26.884
Wow.

21:26.886 --> 21:27.885
And why are you here?

21:28.888 --> 21:30.454
Rory went to school 
with my kid.

21:30.456 --> 21:31.689
Oh, the divorcee with
stress hives.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.357
No, my other one.

21:33.359 --> 21:35.393
My son.

21:35.395 --> 21:36.994
Speaking of which, 
how are they doing?

21:36.996 --> 21:38.663
- You wanna see?
- Yeah.

21:38.665 --> 21:40.798
- In a church?
- Yeah, yes, sir.

21:40.800 --> 21:41.666
Fading already.

21:41.668 --> 21:42.733
Who's better than me?

21:42.735 --> 21:43.801
Nobody.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.505
(woman groans)

21:48.374 --> 21:51.042
(Marty chuckles)

21:54.314 --> 21:54.845
Hey.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.815
Why do they call it a
wake anyway?

21:57.817 --> 21:59.567
What do you mean?

21:59.568 --> 22:01.318
Well, it's not like Rory's 
waking anytime soon.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.755
Oh, but if he got up, if he got up 
right this second,

22:04.757 --> 22:06.457
then we can call it a wake.

22:06.459 --> 22:08.993
Yeah, that's Rory,
the reawakening.

22:08.995 --> 22:10.594
Will you two please shut up?

22:10.596 --> 22:12.096
Yes, I apologize.

22:12.098 --> 22:13.097
You stink of marijuana.

22:13.099 --> 22:14.365
Oh, it's not me, it's him.

22:14.367 --> 22:16.334
It is not me, you know it's him.

22:16.336 --> 22:17.702
He's wearing a fedora.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.471
(Marty chuckles)

22:20.473 --> 22:21.405
Shit.

22:26.813 --> 22:28.612
What's the matter?

22:28.614 --> 22:30.715
I shouldn't be here,
I shouldn't be here.

22:30.717 --> 22:31.882
- Oh god, are you okay?
- Nana Marie.

22:31.884 --> 22:32.950
[Scott] I'm sorry, are you okay?

22:32.952 --> 22:35.519
Hey, hey, go, just go,
just go, go.

22:35.521 --> 22:36.387
- Thanks.
- Go.

22:36.389 --> 22:37.455
Ma'am, are you okay?

22:37.456 --> 22:38.522
Get away from me.

22:38.523 --> 22:39.589
Get your filthy hands off of her.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.108
I'm just trying to help her.

22:41.109 --> 22:42.625
I'm not playing
grab-ass or anything.

22:50.970 --> 22:53.037
(sighs)

22:55.441 --> 22:56.574
You okay, Rollins?

22:56.576 --> 22:58.008
Yeah, yeah, how is the woman?

22:58.010 --> 22:59.076
Oh, the one you body slammed?

22:59.078 --> 23:00.011
Yes.

23:00.012 --> 23:00.945
That's a flagrant two,
by the way.

23:00.946 --> 23:01.879
Okay, what happened to her?

23:01.881 --> 23:02.980
Uh, broken clavicle.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.015
- Are you serious?
- No, she's fine.

23:05.017 --> 23:05.950
I'm just kidding.

23:06.786 --> 23:07.752
Thank you, by the way.

23:07.754 --> 23:08.819
You don't have to follow me out,

23:08.821 --> 23:10.121
man, you can go back inside.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.422
- No, actually I can't.
- Why?

23:11.424 --> 23:13.858
Because I was 
properly identified.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.092
By who?

23:15.094 --> 23:16.494
My son.

23:16.496 --> 23:19.864
Oh, this is so wonderful.

23:19.866 --> 23:21.599
This means you're 
a wake crasher too.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.000
Well, I was gonna talk to him

23:23.002 --> 23:27.405
after he paid his proper respects, 
but it's a long story.

23:27.407 --> 23:29.407
- Right?
- So, short answer,

23:29.409 --> 23:31.509
I am also a wake crasher.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.611
- Come on.
- Yeah, let's get outta here.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.947
- Don't look back.
- Yeah, I'm, I'm, yeah.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.617
Did you even know Rory?

23:40.620 --> 23:43.053
Not enough to have 
been there, no.

23:43.055 --> 23:46.123
I mean, I knew of him, but I knew 
that she knew him, so...

23:46.125 --> 23:48.592
Oh, so you were just there 
to see the girl.

23:49.462 --> 23:50.194
Yeah.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.496
Yeah, let me guess, your ex,

23:52.498 --> 23:54.498
the one that got away,
that old classic?

23:54.500 --> 23:56.017
Mm-mm.

23:56.018 --> 23:57.535
No, the one I ran away from.

23:57.537 --> 23:58.881
Oh, the remix.

23:58.882 --> 24:00.226
Oh, you've heard of the remix?

24:00.227 --> 24:01.571
Oh, so you're trying 
to get back together,

24:01.574 --> 24:04.608
or are you just a good
old-fashioned stalker?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.210
I honestly don't even know.

24:06.212 --> 24:07.995
It might be the latter,

24:07.996 --> 24:09.779
which is really scaring
the shit out of me.

24:11.217 --> 24:12.149
Now, how old are you?

24:12.151 --> 24:13.551
Why?

24:13.552 --> 24:14.952
You're way too young
to be this defeated.

24:14.954 --> 24:16.854
Tony, two Jagerbombs, please.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.656
- Jagerbombs.
- Oh yes.

24:18.657 --> 24:20.457
- How old are you?
- 65, thank you very much.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.709
Oo.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.959
You know what, maybe
I should find a girl

24:22.962 --> 24:24.228
with daddy issues, 
what do you think?

24:24.230 --> 24:26.530
Oo, probably more like 
granddaddy issues,

24:26.532 --> 24:27.565
what do you think about that?

24:27.567 --> 24:28.799
Oh, that's funny.

24:28.801 --> 24:29.967
Well, I'm a comedian.

24:31.204 --> 24:32.169
Really?

24:32.171 --> 24:33.504
Why do you say it like that?

24:33.505 --> 24:34.838
[Marty] Well, 
I don't get that from you.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.106
What do you get from me then?

24:36.108 --> 24:37.174
I get an insurance adjuster.

24:37.176 --> 24:38.843
No.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.511
I get a car salesman
at a Kia dealership.

24:40.513 --> 24:43.047
Oh wow, thank you.

24:43.048 --> 24:45.582
- I get a dog walker.
- A dog walker?

24:45.585 --> 24:47.818
I get fundraiser for
(speaking in foreign language).

24:47.820 --> 24:48.886
Fine, I could be a fundraiser

24:48.888 --> 24:49.820
for (speaking in
foreign language).

24:49.822 --> 24:50.921
(both laughing)

24:50.922 --> 24:52.021
No, you're just cynical as shit.

24:52.024 --> 24:53.624
You're morose even, 
you know?

24:53.626 --> 24:54.925
Hey, you want some 
real jokes?

24:54.927 --> 24:55.893
[Scott] Yeah.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.561
[Marty] My Twitter account.

24:57.563 --> 24:59.263
- DermatolOG.
- Thank you.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.498
Nicely done.

25:00.500 --> 25:02.032
You have over 12,000 followers?

25:02.034 --> 25:03.542
[Marty] That's me.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.051
[Scott] And you're verified?

25:05.052 --> 25:06.560
Is that what that blue
check mark means?

25:06.561 --> 25:08.069
You know what that blue 
check mark means.

25:08.074 --> 25:11.509
When I die, I want someone
to take over my account

25:11.511 --> 25:14.545
and tweet boo, motherfuckers,
every month or so.

25:15.548 --> 25:16.947
This is actually,
that's actually...

25:16.949 --> 25:17.915
(laughs)

25:17.917 --> 25:19.750
That's actually pretty amazing.

25:19.752 --> 25:21.151
Well, I'm a good follow, man.

25:21.153 --> 25:23.053
No, no, listen, 
I'm serious about that too.

25:23.055 --> 25:27.124
So, if you're interested,
doctorsmooooth@aol.com,

25:27.126 --> 25:29.627
- that's four Os, thank you.
- Wow, aol.com.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.228
You really are 65.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.930
What's your password, 
password?

25:36.269 --> 25:37.134
No.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.002
It's email.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.937
(Scott laughs)

25:39.939 --> 25:43.307
The password for 
your email is email?

25:43.309 --> 25:44.742
Yeah, I live on the edge, man.

25:44.744 --> 25:46.277
Anything to throw off
those Russians.

25:46.279 --> 25:47.678
- Oh my god.
- All right.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.547
Here it is, mother's milk 
for the soul.

25:49.549 --> 25:50.714
- Ready?
- Yeah, how do you do it?

25:50.716 --> 25:52.583
You just drop it in or...

25:52.585 --> 25:53.984
You've never done 
a Jagerbomb before?

25:53.986 --> 25:55.753
Seeing as I'm not a 19 year 
old sorority girl,

25:55.755 --> 25:56.921
- no, I've never done a--
- So cynical.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.506
I'm not trying, just tell me.

25:58.507 --> 26:00.090
What do you do, do you drop
it in or what do you do?

26:00.092 --> 26:01.592
[Marty] You drop it in, 
drink right away.

26:01.594 --> 26:02.660
- Right away?
- Yeah.

26:02.662 --> 26:03.894
I can't drink fast, you sure?

26:03.896 --> 26:05.229
Ready, boom.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.096
(glasses clinking)

26:06.098 --> 26:07.898
Up, in, now.

26:13.139 --> 26:14.605
Mm, mm, mm, mm.

26:17.877 --> 26:18.742
I don't wanna.

26:18.744 --> 26:19.777
Oh, come on.

26:19.779 --> 26:20.644
It's good for you.

26:20.646 --> 26:21.879
Come on, oh, come on.

26:24.617 --> 26:25.816
That took way too long.

26:26.719 --> 26:27.651
And?

26:30.823 --> 26:32.189
That was a tasty beverage.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.359
That was really fucking good.

26:35.360 --> 26:37.660
You see, if there's one thing 
I know about, it's booze.

26:37.663 --> 26:38.963
Not dermatological advice?

26:38.965 --> 26:39.897
Oh fuck no.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.365
Tony, two more, two more.

26:41.367 --> 26:42.900
Absolutely not, Tony.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.224
I've gotta go home.

26:44.225 --> 26:45.547
Who cares about your home?

26:45.548 --> 26:46.870
Long Island people are 
fantastic at drinking

26:46.872 --> 26:48.138
like it's their last day on earth.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.140
Drink up, you wake-crashing
son of a bitch.

26:50.142 --> 26:51.275
Let's go, bombs away.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.944
- Yee.
- Yeah, there you go.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.012
Drop.

26:55.013 --> 26:56.079
You don't even count down?

26:56.082 --> 26:57.848
Hoist, come on, boom.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.049
- Up yours.
- What?

26:59.051 --> 27:00.317
Mm-hmm.

27:00.319 --> 27:01.952
Oo, for the win.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.088
Eight ball in the corner pocket, 
all right?

27:04.090 --> 27:06.223
Eight ball, don't be afraid 
of the dark, baby.

27:06.225 --> 27:07.958
- Take us home, Marty.
- Mm-hmm.

27:07.960 --> 27:11.295
And if I make it, you have 
to go out with me.

27:11.297 --> 27:14.164
Oh, I told you, I'm married.

27:15.701 --> 27:18.702
What, to that idea, to the thing 
I just came up with?

27:18.704 --> 27:20.638
You know, 
I love her enthusiasm.

27:20.640 --> 27:22.172
Come on, I'm fun.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.807
- I'm a lot of fun.
- Okay.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.809
- Yeah, all right.
- Believe in yourself.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.145
- Woo.
- Breathe in.

27:28.147 --> 27:30.280
[Marty] Yeah, I'm good.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.051
How do you scratch...

27:34.954 --> 27:36.086
You scratched on the eight,

27:36.088 --> 27:38.722
you scratched on the eight 
ball though.

27:38.724 --> 27:39.657
Ah.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.292
A pleasure, a pleasure.

27:42.294 --> 27:43.449
Very good game.

27:43.450 --> 27:44.605
I'm so sorry.

27:44.606 --> 27:45.761
Listen, it was a honor
to lose to you.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.064
Thank you so much, 
it was so much fun.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.899
Vanessa, right?

27:48.900 --> 27:50.733
You know, oh god, 
can I buy you a drink?

27:50.736 --> 27:52.219
Or a car, or a condo.

27:52.220 --> 27:53.703
That's a lot, that's a lot, 
take it down a notch.

27:53.706 --> 27:54.755
Take it down a notch.

27:54.756 --> 27:55.805
The four of us could 
live together.

27:55.808 --> 27:57.141
- We'd be great.
- We gotta go.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.384
You see?

27:58.385 --> 27:59.626
That's the story of my life.

27:59.627 --> 28:00.868
The good ones just always go.

28:00.869 --> 28:02.110
- So go, please.
- Your dad's a charmer.

28:02.114 --> 28:03.147
Apparently, right?

28:03.149 --> 28:04.415
Okay, all right, bye.

28:04.417 --> 28:05.816
Don't you wanna walk them out,
Dad?

28:05.818 --> 28:06.950
Yeah, you know, actually, I do.

28:06.952 --> 28:07.985
I bet you do.

28:07.987 --> 28:09.904
Yeah, hey, girls, girls.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.822
Would you do me a favor and
just call me when you get home,

28:11.824 --> 28:13.157
'cause you know how I worry.

28:13.159 --> 28:15.192
(hip hop music)

28:15.194 --> 28:17.061
Oh, you know, 
what did I tell you guys?

28:17.063 --> 28:18.796
Oh, Marty, not again, man.

28:18.798 --> 28:20.330
You know, if you're gonna pump 
money into that machine,

28:20.332 --> 28:22.166
you might as well 
play the original stuff.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.701
What's the original stuff?

28:23.703 --> 28:25.069
You don't know?

28:25.071 --> 28:25.936
He don't know.

28:25.938 --> 28:27.071
Here we go.

28:27.073 --> 28:28.806
Hip hop, rap, all comes

28:28.808 --> 28:30.974
from the same thing,
jazz and soul.

28:30.976 --> 28:32.142
[Xavier] All right, I'll play a little

28:32.144 --> 28:33.077
Sly and the Family Stone next.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.745
Take me higher.

28:34.746 --> 28:36.412
- Look at this.
- Grandpa knows his shit.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.048
Hey, first of all, I am a grandpa.

28:38.050 --> 28:39.983
And second, I do know my shit.

28:39.985 --> 28:41.351
(both laughing)

28:41.353 --> 28:42.419
Hey, these are my nephews.

28:42.421 --> 28:43.821
This is Xavier.

28:43.823 --> 28:45.022
Rocket ship.

28:45.024 --> 28:46.090
Boo, and this is Aaron.

28:46.092 --> 28:47.291
Yeah, all right.

28:47.293 --> 28:48.792
It's nice to meet you guys.

28:48.794 --> 28:49.893
Nice to meet you too, man.

28:49.895 --> 28:52.029
We're not really his nephews.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.130
No, I figured, I mean.

28:53.132 --> 28:54.064
Why did you tell him?

28:54.066 --> 28:54.998
He was gonna find out.

28:55.000 --> 28:56.233
He was not gonna find out.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.402
- He's a mil--
- Here, here, here, here.

29:00.005 --> 29:02.039
So you found out 
about the wake

29:02.041 --> 29:03.974
on Facebook and crashed it?

29:03.976 --> 29:05.275
It wasn't just me,
it was him too.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.443
Just a little bit.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.312
Facebook's messed up
like that, man.

29:08.314 --> 29:09.513
I mean, too much 
information can

29:09.515 --> 29:11.048
be a bad thing, 
you know what I mean?

29:11.050 --> 29:12.182
Man, screw social media.

29:12.184 --> 29:13.784
Screw social media is right.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.086
Facebook as an adult is all 
like political rants.

29:16.088 --> 29:17.488
It's just so fucking stupid.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.156
People checking in
everywhere they go

29:19.158 --> 29:20.390
like anyone gives a fuck.

29:20.392 --> 29:22.826
And those damn 
inspirational quotes.

29:22.828 --> 29:24.428
Oh my god, 'cause that's 
what I need.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.330
Someone I haven't heard
from since the 10th grade

29:26.332 --> 29:28.365
tell me to dance like
nobody's watching.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.400
Come on, like, you know
what I'm saying?

29:30.402 --> 29:31.802
Wait, 
what about the baby pictures?

29:31.804 --> 29:33.521
That's all I ever see.

29:33.522 --> 29:35.239
Don't get me started on
baby pictures.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.840
You're proud of your baby,
I get it,

29:36.842 --> 29:38.542
but unless your kid is riding 
a motorcycle

29:38.544 --> 29:41.145
through like a flaming hoop 
or is the new drummer

29:41.147 --> 29:43.547
for Van Halen, I don't need
to see four pictures a day.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.366
You get one.

29:45.367 --> 29:47.184
Everybody gets one baby
picture and that's it.

29:47.186 --> 29:48.819
Van fucking Halen.

29:48.821 --> 29:50.954
Van fucking Halen.

29:50.956 --> 29:52.489
- My man.
- That is the whitest

29:52.491 --> 29:54.224
goddamn reference I've heard in 
a long time.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.859
Do you wanna hear white?

29:55.861 --> 29:58.295
Today, I spent an hour
downloading NPR podcasts

29:58.297 --> 29:59.163
in a Jamba Juice.

29:59.165 --> 30:00.931
- So...
- Wow.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.500
Ladies and gentlemen,
step right up

30:03.502 --> 30:05.803
and meet the whitest
motherfucker in the world.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.271
Hello, everybody.

30:07.273 --> 30:11.108
I once bought a Bon Iver
album in a Whole Foods.

30:11.110 --> 30:12.176
Give me some more.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.212
[Marty] Mm, come on, be a man.

30:17.216 --> 30:21.185
There you go, there you go,
there you go.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.288
I really needed this.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.856
Why is that?

30:25.858 --> 30:28.225
I just haven't been out much 
since I've been back.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.060
All my friends have adult lives.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.461
It's such a mind-fuck.

30:31.463 --> 30:32.462
Yeah, well...

30:36.168 --> 30:40.337
The older you get, the
less friends you have.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.840
I just feel like I would have
my life figured out by now.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.208
I mean, all my friends do.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.976
Let me tell you something 
about life,

30:45.978 --> 30:47.377
nobody has their shit 
figured out.

30:47.379 --> 30:49.346
Everybody moves at 
their own speed.

30:49.348 --> 30:52.516
I understand that, 
but I just fucking regret the way--

30:52.518 --> 30:53.350
Something about the blonde?

30:53.352 --> 30:54.868
Yes, yes, yes.

30:54.869 --> 30:56.385
Because when I left, she said 
that I was the one.

30:56.388 --> 30:58.639
Those were her words.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.891
She told all my friends,
she said that I was the one.

31:00.893 --> 31:02.392
I hear you, I hear you,
and that's cool.

31:02.394 --> 31:04.561
But maybe she wasn't
the one for you.

31:04.563 --> 31:06.430
You know?

31:06.431 --> 31:08.298
'Cause sometimes those things 
don't always line up.

31:08.299 --> 31:10.166
That's why the good lord gave
us weed and booze, you know?

31:10.169 --> 31:12.436
They're numbing agents
against regret,

31:12.438 --> 31:15.973
because regret is real.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.243
It's one of the few things
in the world that is.

31:19.245 --> 31:20.110
How so?

31:20.112 --> 31:21.478
What does that even mean?

31:21.480 --> 31:24.982
It means that happiness fades,
okay?

31:24.984 --> 31:28.585
And sadness dulls over time,
it just does every time.

31:28.587 --> 31:32.356
But regret, 
that shit is real, man.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.557
That shit lingers.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.127
(coughs)

31:38.397 --> 31:43.233
I saw a little hint of the comedian 
back at the bar.

31:44.236 --> 31:45.435
You were funny, man,
you were really funny.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.938
- Nah, come on.
- No, it's cool.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.139
You gonna be working
anytime soon?

31:49.141 --> 31:50.540
'Cause I would come and
check you out.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.142
Oh no.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.377
I'm not feeling really
funny lately.

31:53.379 --> 31:55.646
Oh, too bad.

31:55.648 --> 31:57.180
It's a Tuesday night and
you're a little drunk

31:57.182 --> 31:59.316
and you're smoking dope
with your dermatologist,

31:59.318 --> 32:00.183
you should...

32:00.185 --> 32:01.251
(both laughing)

32:01.253 --> 32:03.020
You should write that shit down.

32:03.022 --> 32:05.923
Write that shit down, 
I'd pay to see that.

32:05.925 --> 32:07.424
I don't talk about 
my personal life.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.160
I do more like jokes and bits.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.646
Jokes and bits?

32:12.647 --> 32:14.130
Yeah, jokes and, why are you 
looking at me like that?

32:14.133 --> 32:16.417
I don't know what that is.

32:16.418 --> 32:18.702
I get on the stage and
I tell, I say funny words.

32:18.704 --> 32:20.103
- Funny words?
- Yeah.

32:20.472 --> 32:21.972
All right.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.473
You know, the guys I like the best 
are the guys who are real

32:23.475 --> 32:26.276
that talk about real stuff
in their life, you know?

32:26.278 --> 32:28.245
The real guys are the ones 
that you remember.

32:28.247 --> 32:29.112
[Scott] Mm.

32:30.249 --> 32:31.915
Why don't you talk 
about your real life?

32:31.916 --> 32:33.582
- I don't really have a life.
- That's hilarious.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.818
That's not supposed 
to be funny.

32:34.819 --> 32:36.052
- That's hilarious.
- That's sad and depressing.

32:36.055 --> 32:38.122
Don't laugh at that.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.190
And you're laughing that
I'm a fucking loser.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.558
What about you, 
what about you, huh?

32:41.560 --> 32:43.360
What, what about me?

32:43.361 --> 32:45.161
Was the big dream to be
a suburban dermatologist?

32:45.164 --> 32:46.730
No, no no no no no.

32:46.732 --> 32:49.499
I started out in medicine,
in general medicine.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.101
I was gonna be a surgeon.

32:51.103 --> 32:54.604
I was a resident at St.
Anthony's

32:54.606 --> 32:56.974
- in Bethpage, Long Island.
- Dude, that's where I was born.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.576
I thought you looked familiar.

32:59.578 --> 33:00.928
You see this face?

33:00.929 --> 33:02.279
It was that newborn
with that head of hair.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.714
That's me.

33:03.715 --> 33:05.148
I was all hair when I came out.

33:08.153 --> 33:12.489
No, I just had this 
interesting epiphany.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.691
- I was terrified of blood.
- Jeez.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.360
Yeah, freaked me out.

33:16.362 --> 33:18.128
So I made a U-turn, 
went back to school,

33:18.130 --> 33:20.263
and reemerged as 
a doctor of de skin.

33:20.265 --> 33:21.915
[Scott] Mm.

33:21.916 --> 33:23.566
And it was more mellow
and better for me.

33:23.569 --> 33:25.736
And at the time, 
I needed more structure,

33:25.738 --> 33:30.140
'cause I was living hard.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.009
I was running in the fast line.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.577
- Like a rolling stone.
- Yeah, like Keith Richards.

33:33.579 --> 33:34.644
- Like Keith Richards.
- Yeah, man.

33:34.646 --> 33:37.547
It was...

33:37.548 --> 33:40.449
And then my first wife died
and I needed to regroup and...

33:41.620 --> 33:43.320
I'm sorry about that,
man, I had no idea.

33:43.322 --> 33:45.489
Why would you, you know?

33:45.491 --> 33:49.526
I had a second wife 
and she died too.

33:49.528 --> 33:51.595
Jesus Christ.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.663
Yeah, yeah, but hey listen,
I'm not the Durst guy.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.165
You know, I'm not, no.

33:55.167 --> 33:58.602
Just, they were both
different situations.

33:58.604 --> 34:00.203
But both, you know.

34:02.074 --> 34:03.640
But my second wife
was a godsend.

34:05.244 --> 34:07.077
She just helped me.

34:07.079 --> 34:09.780
I really needed to tame
the beast, so to speak.

34:09.782 --> 34:10.714
And...

34:12.451 --> 34:15.185
Is that why your kid didn't 
want to see you today?

34:15.187 --> 34:16.485
Wasn't a fan of the beast?

34:20.759 --> 34:23.092
No, he's not a fan of the beast.

34:26.130 --> 34:26.797
Yeah.

34:26.799 --> 34:28.032
[Cop] Freeze.

34:28.033 --> 34:29.266
Stay where you are,
the both of you.

34:29.268 --> 34:30.217
It's the cops.

34:30.217 --> 34:31.167
What should I do with the joint?

34:31.170 --> 34:32.235
- Should I eat it?
- Eat it?

34:32.237 --> 34:33.270
All right.

34:33.271 --> 34:34.304
No no no, what are 
you fucking doing?

34:34.306 --> 34:35.054
You just swallowed...

34:35.056 --> 34:35.804
I said it like a question.

34:35.808 --> 34:37.558
I said eat it?

34:37.559 --> 34:39.309
- Hands where I can see them.
- Yeah, yep.

34:39.311 --> 34:41.344
Act like you're not high.
(window tapping)

34:41.346 --> 34:43.746
- Lower the window.
- Yeah, of course.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.248
Lower it down.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.417
(window whirring)

34:47.418 --> 34:49.319
- All the way down.
- It's just an old car.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.655
- All the way down.
- Here it comes.

34:51.657 --> 34:52.856
Here it comes.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.426
- Is that weed I smell?
- No.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.328
No, no no no no no.

34:58.330 --> 35:01.164
We're actually--
(Marty coughs)

35:01.166 --> 35:02.099
[Cop] Oh.

35:02.501 --> 35:03.756
I'm sorry.

35:03.757 --> 35:05.012
Why don't you shut your
fucking mouth?

35:05.013 --> 35:06.268
You're right, we should
shut our fucking mouths.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.337
We should shut our
fucking mouths.

35:07.338 --> 35:08.404
We should get the hell 
out of here.

35:08.407 --> 35:10.340
We shouldn't even be 
here to begin with.

35:12.144 --> 35:14.244
I am sorry, is your name Ruis?

35:14.880 --> 35:16.413
- Yes.
- Yes.

35:16.415 --> 35:19.616
Dude, Scott, I'm Meg's brother.

35:19.618 --> 35:21.818
- Wait, Scott?
- Yes, dude, Scott.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.420
- Hey, man, how you doing?
- What's up, brother?

35:23.422 --> 35:25.522
- I'm so happy to meet you.
- Good to meet you, man.

35:25.524 --> 35:26.857
- This is Marty.
- Oh hey.

35:26.859 --> 35:29.426
I'm sorry, Marty, 
how you doing?

35:29.428 --> 35:30.794
He swallowed his joint

35:30.795 --> 35:32.161
because we thought you
were gonna kill us.

35:32.164 --> 35:33.196
[Marty] I'll find it later.

35:33.198 --> 35:35.732
(all laughing)

35:38.470 --> 35:39.781
Mm.

35:39.782 --> 35:41.093
That's really good weed, Marty.

35:41.094 --> 35:42.405
Ruis, I gotta say,
the way you came at us,

35:42.407 --> 35:44.307
oo, I fucking loved it.

35:44.309 --> 35:45.809
- Pretty cool, right?
- Yes, very cool.

35:45.811 --> 35:46.910
It's kinda like hey.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.579
Shut your fucking mouth.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.282
That was scary.

35:52.284 --> 35:53.517
It's good, right?

35:53.518 --> 35:54.751
Yeah, that's pretty scary.

35:54.753 --> 35:57.154
- I try.
- Yeah, it's good.

35:57.156 --> 35:58.221
You guys should try it, man.

35:58.223 --> 35:59.389
Like, this whole the cop thing.

35:59.391 --> 36:01.842
It's really fun.

36:01.843 --> 36:04.294
Really, you know, brings it out,
you know?

36:06.732 --> 36:07.965
Oh.

36:07.966 --> 36:09.199
Don't move a muscle, scumbag.

36:09.201 --> 36:10.400
Because if you move a muscle,

36:10.402 --> 36:11.835
I'ma shoot you in your asshole.

36:11.837 --> 36:13.253
- Yeah.
- Ow.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.670
Praying for your life won't 
do you any good

36:14.673 --> 36:16.907
'cause right now, you're
looking into the eyes

36:16.909 --> 36:18.542
of the devil himself.

36:18.544 --> 36:20.443
- That's really good.
- Every duck has his limit.

36:20.445 --> 36:23.280
And you, scum, just pushed me 
over the line.

36:23.582 --> 36:24.959
Duck?

36:24.960 --> 36:26.337
You can use it if you want.

36:26.338 --> 36:27.715
But full disclosure, it is from 
"Howard the Duck" so...

36:27.719 --> 36:29.302
That was cinema.

36:29.303 --> 36:30.886
- Oh, that's a good movie.
- Oh wow, oh wow.

36:30.889 --> 36:32.556
- I love that movie.
- I love that, yeah.

36:32.558 --> 36:34.824
It's insane, that's an Oscar film.

36:34.826 --> 36:35.892
So let me ask you something.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.861
Were you gonna arrest us?

36:37.863 --> 36:38.862
No, no.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.363
I can't arrest anyone.

36:40.365 --> 36:42.399
[Marty] So you give
us a ticket?

36:42.401 --> 36:44.968
You know, it's fucked up,
I can't even give tickets.

36:44.970 --> 36:45.902
Well, what can you do?

36:45.904 --> 36:47.237
What can you do?

36:47.239 --> 36:47.604
Nothing.

36:48.874 --> 36:51.975
You can just show up and
just tell people to go home.

36:51.977 --> 36:53.977
You know, it's like, hey!

36:53.979 --> 36:56.947
Go home and watch Netflix
and eat Doritos.

36:56.949 --> 36:59.749
Oh my god.

36:59.751 --> 37:03.253
Ruis, I gotta say it,
you're fucking awesome.

37:03.922 --> 37:04.854
I know, right?

37:06.725 --> 37:08.458
You guys want a ride home?

37:08.460 --> 37:10.327
Yeah yeah yeah, if you don't 
give me a ride home,

37:10.329 --> 37:11.828
I'm gonna hurt myself.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.830
Yeah, and you know what?

37:13.832 --> 37:17.534
Even though I happen to be
a fantastic drunk driver,

37:17.536 --> 37:20.070
I think it's the wrong thing.

37:20.071 --> 37:22.605
So I'll get my car tomorrow,
I'll take a ride with you now.

37:22.608 --> 37:23.873
- Let's go.
- Shall we?

37:23.875 --> 37:25.275
- Yes, let's go.
- Great.

37:25.277 --> 37:26.343
- Oh.
- My bad.

37:26.345 --> 37:28.311
- Careful along the maze.
- Yeah.

37:28.313 --> 37:29.512
- Careful.
- Okay.

37:29.514 --> 37:31.414
- Ow, fuck.
- This way.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.549
- Yeah, of course.
- This way.

37:32.551 --> 37:35.285
- Scott, this way.
- Yeah, dude.

37:35.287 --> 37:37.254
- I don't know which way to go?
- Yeah.

37:37.256 --> 37:38.989
[Scott] I'm like 34.

37:40.425 --> 37:43.793
(car horn honking)

37:43.795 --> 37:46.329
Let me know when you find
that joint, all right?

37:46.331 --> 37:49.766
[Ruis] Yeah, and don't smoke it.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.853
Hey, put the weapon down.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.939
Put the weapon down.
(car horn honking)

37:58.677 --> 38:01.678
(soft piano music)

38:07.686 --> 38:10.487
(Marty humming)

38:44.656 --> 38:45.588
Scotty.

38:46.525 --> 38:48.058
Scotty, are you awake?

38:48.060 --> 38:49.443
No.

38:49.444 --> 38:50.827
I'm just checking you're 
not oversleeping

38:50.829 --> 38:51.961
for an appointment or anything.

38:51.963 --> 38:53.330
Do you know what time it is?

38:53.332 --> 38:54.097
Yeah, Mom.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.032
It's 4:67, we're fine.

38:56.034 --> 38:58.868
4:67 isn't a time, honey.

38:58.870 --> 38:59.819
Oh man.

38:59.820 --> 39:00.769
Okay, and where's your car?

39:00.772 --> 39:02.706
I didn't see it outside.

39:02.708 --> 39:04.474
Um.

39:04.476 --> 39:05.642
Battery died.

39:05.644 --> 39:07.577
I need a jump today, okay?

39:07.578 --> 39:09.511
Well, I guess it's finally
starting to show its age.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.114
But when you get up,
you wanna do me a favor?

39:11.116 --> 39:13.834
Yeah, 100%.

39:13.835 --> 39:16.553
But first, Mom, can you get
me like a bucket of Advil

39:16.555 --> 39:17.787
and like some Eggos.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.923
Oh, I love you very much.

39:21.059 --> 39:22.659
I love you too.

39:23.895 --> 39:25.562
- Now get up.
- Yeah.

39:45.150 --> 39:48.084
(sander whirring)

39:58.897 --> 40:02.031
Why are you sanding 
the screen?

40:02.033 --> 40:03.433
What?

40:03.434 --> 40:04.834
Why are you sanding 
the screen?

40:04.836 --> 40:07.103
Well, in order to re-stain 
the screens,

40:07.105 --> 40:09.139
one must first sand them.

40:09.141 --> 40:10.407
Yeah.

40:10.409 --> 40:11.474
Yeah, 
a new stain would look good.

40:11.476 --> 40:12.675
That's a good idea.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.446
You need something, Scott?

40:16.448 --> 40:17.113
No.

40:17.115 --> 40:17.747
Um.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.467
I just wanted to tell you

40:20.468 --> 40:22.418
that I'm not gonna be staying
here for too much longer.

40:22.421 --> 40:23.586
I'm gonna get a place 
of my own.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.455
I've already been looking
on Craigslist.

40:25.457 --> 40:27.624
Well, how much is this place 
of your own gonna cost?

40:27.626 --> 40:29.559
You don't have 
to worry about it.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.493
I went down to Governor's, 
I'm scheduling a set for myself.

40:31.496 --> 40:33.797
And I know I shouldn't be
starting on open mics again,

40:33.799 --> 40:35.131
but if I want to get
paid for standup--

40:35.133 --> 40:36.499
Scott, come on.

40:36.501 --> 40:40.069
Enough of this fantasy
land bullshit.

40:40.071 --> 40:42.138
I know you probably don't
wanna hear that.

40:42.140 --> 40:43.606
Probably?

40:43.608 --> 40:45.875
Okay, I'll tell you a story,
all right?

40:45.877 --> 40:48.645
Um, a couple summers back,
when your uncle Jeffrey and I,

40:48.647 --> 40:51.014
we went to Vegas, we were
on this incredible heater

40:51.016 --> 40:52.916
on the three card tables
at the MGM Grand.

40:52.918 --> 40:56.186
So, the pit boss, he gives us 
a couple of comps.

40:56.188 --> 40:57.921
That night, 
we go to see Brad Garrett.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.924
And I gotta tell you, Son, 
he was just fucking hilarious.

41:00.926 --> 41:03.860
I laughed so hard, I spit gin
and tonic all over your uncle.

41:03.862 --> 41:06.095
It was coming out of my
goddamn nose.

41:06.097 --> 41:08.014
Why are you telling me this?

41:08.015 --> 41:09.932
I'm sorry, Scott, 
but you're no Brad Garrett.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.901
Oh my, are you serious?

41:11.903 --> 41:13.937
That's where you were going?

41:13.938 --> 41:15.972
Look, you wanted to give
it a shot, I get that, okay?

41:15.974 --> 41:18.174
And fine, 
the lumberyard's not for you.

41:18.176 --> 41:19.242
Please, let's not do this again.

41:19.244 --> 41:21.177
No no, just listen to me.

41:21.179 --> 41:22.946
That is what it is, okay?

41:22.948 --> 41:25.582
Just go and find 
yourself a real job.

41:25.584 --> 41:27.317
You're in your 30s

41:27.318 --> 41:29.051
and you're telling jokes 
for pocket change.

41:29.054 --> 41:31.271
You're better than that.

41:31.272 --> 41:33.489
I mean, why don't you go and
tell your jokes in an office?

41:33.492 --> 41:34.157
Okay?

41:34.159 --> 41:35.758
I mean, be that guy.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.227
The funny mailman.

41:40.966 --> 41:43.666
(somber music)

41:43.668 --> 41:45.735
(sighs)

42:07.993 --> 42:09.125
What up, Marty, 
how you feeling?

42:09.127 --> 42:11.094
Oh man.

42:11.096 --> 42:12.795
How do I look?

42:12.797 --> 42:14.931
- You look like a five.
- A five?

42:15.967 --> 42:17.800
Uh, this today?

42:17.802 --> 42:19.002
This is so recent.

42:20.572 --> 42:21.971
I got a fresh one coming
out in two minutes.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.858
Thank you.

42:24.859 --> 42:27.744
Give me two regular, nice and hot, 
crush red on the side,

42:27.746 --> 42:31.080
and, um, a Thorazine smoothie.

42:31.082 --> 42:33.149
- Yeah, the usual.
- Yeah.

42:33.151 --> 42:34.083
Uh, oh.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.853
(acoustic guitar music)

42:36.855 --> 42:38.922
(sighs)

43:25.704 --> 43:27.670
Welcome to Do the Twist,
can I help you, sir?

43:27.672 --> 43:29.739
Oh, I hope so, uh...

43:29.741 --> 43:31.140
- Sanjay.
- Sanjay.

43:31.142 --> 43:33.343
Sanjay, see, I got an
enormous problem.

43:33.345 --> 43:35.479
A problem?

43:35.480 --> 43:37.614
Yeah, I got one of those
new coconut pretzels,

43:37.616 --> 43:38.815
you know what I'm talking about?

43:38.817 --> 43:39.816
- Yes.
- Yeah.

43:39.817 --> 43:40.816
I bet you think they're
delicious, right?

43:40.819 --> 43:42.085
They're nice.

43:42.087 --> 43:44.087
They made me shit my pants,
Sanjay.

43:45.090 --> 43:46.155
Oh.

43:46.157 --> 43:47.234
No.

43:47.235 --> 43:48.312
Oh no is right, Sanjay.

43:48.313 --> 43:49.390
That's why I'm here,
retribution.

43:49.394 --> 43:50.810
I'm here to get what's mine.

43:50.811 --> 43:52.227
Where is your manager, I
wanna talk to your manager.

43:52.230 --> 43:53.663
Is this her?

43:53.664 --> 43:55.097
Is this the woman that 
made me shit my pants?

43:55.100 --> 43:56.399
No no no, 
she did not make you--

43:56.401 --> 43:57.333
She did.

43:57.335 --> 43:58.901
Go make pretzel dough, Sanjay.

43:58.903 --> 43:59.836
Okay.

44:01.706 --> 44:02.672
May I help you?

44:04.075 --> 44:05.308
You left your wallet at home.

44:05.310 --> 44:06.826
Mom asked me 
to bring it to you.

44:06.827 --> 44:08.343
She's afraid to get pulled over 
and a cop would be like,

44:08.346 --> 44:09.529
where's your license?

44:09.530 --> 44:10.713
That woman is a saint on earth.

44:10.715 --> 44:11.648
[Scott] She's incredible.

44:11.650 --> 44:13.049
She's incredible, yeah.

44:15.920 --> 44:18.287
What's with the sunglasses,
Dirty Harry?

44:18.289 --> 44:20.890
What's with the sunglasses
is that 34 year old hangovers

44:20.892 --> 44:22.959
feel like brain cancer.

44:22.961 --> 44:24.577
Light hurts.

44:24.578 --> 44:26.194
Ruis said you were at 
a playground late last night

44:26.197 --> 44:27.897
with an old man.

44:27.899 --> 44:28.965
Sounds like a real rager.

44:28.967 --> 44:32.335
That is actually accurate.

44:32.337 --> 44:34.771
But also, totally not as weird 
as it sounds.

44:34.773 --> 44:36.706
- I highly doubt that.
- Oh okay, well, you're wrong.

44:36.708 --> 44:38.174
Your dad is wrong.

44:38.176 --> 44:39.876
- Give me a pretzel.
- Give me some money.

44:39.878 --> 44:41.844
Oh my goodness.

44:41.846 --> 44:43.813
Are you really trying 
to shake me down?

44:43.815 --> 44:46.015
Can you believe this, Sanjay?

44:46.017 --> 44:48.418
I am close, personal friends 
with Ruis now.

44:48.420 --> 44:49.786
I can call him any time I want.

44:49.788 --> 44:50.887
That is bullshit.

44:50.889 --> 44:51.754
Oh, really?

44:51.756 --> 44:55.858
- 917-543-6--
- Okay.

44:55.860 --> 44:57.427
You get one pretzel.

44:57.429 --> 44:58.995
I want my pretzel to be salted.

44:58.997 --> 44:59.929
Salted.

45:01.132 --> 45:02.031
Basic bitch.

45:02.033 --> 45:04.333
Wow, how dare you.

45:04.335 --> 45:06.002
I am a classic man.

45:06.871 --> 45:07.970
I'm a classic man.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.739
I know what I like and I eat it.

45:12.711 --> 45:14.977
(sniffing)

45:16.181 --> 45:17.847
Thank you for bringing this.

45:19.417 --> 45:20.717
I love you, I guess.

45:20.719 --> 45:22.318
I love you too.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.986
Also questionably.

45:23.988 --> 45:26.289
Let's not talk about it again,
okay?

45:26.291 --> 45:28.124
I love you too, Sanjay.

45:28.126 --> 45:29.926
- I love you.
- Bye.

45:29.928 --> 45:31.761
- I'm gonna head out.
- Go to bed.

45:32.764 --> 45:34.764
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Okay, bye.

45:46.377 --> 45:47.844
Holy shit.

45:49.514 --> 45:50.913
Wait one second, okay?

45:50.915 --> 45:52.815
Wait one second,
wait one second.

45:58.490 --> 45:59.422
Hey.

46:00.825 --> 46:01.958
Oh my god.

46:01.960 --> 46:02.825
[Becky] Wow.

46:02.827 --> 46:04.193
Oh my god.

46:04.195 --> 46:04.927
Hey.

46:05.964 --> 46:07.930
I heard it was true,
I guess it is.

46:07.932 --> 46:09.549
- Wow.
- What, what was?

46:09.550 --> 46:11.167
I just, I heard you 
were at the wake.

46:11.169 --> 46:12.902
- Yes.
- But I didn't necessarily

46:12.904 --> 46:13.970
- believe it.
- I was there.

46:13.972 --> 46:16.072
I didn't know, did you go?

46:16.074 --> 46:18.074
Yeah, obviously I was there.

46:18.076 --> 46:19.976
I didn't even know that
you knew Rory.

46:19.978 --> 46:22.045
Yeah, ugh.

46:22.046 --> 46:24.113
It's heartbreaking, yeah,
one of my good friends.

46:24.115 --> 46:27.517
Did you fly back specifically 
for the wake?

46:27.519 --> 46:29.852
No, I actually moved back home.

46:32.157 --> 46:33.156
- What?
- Yeah.

46:35.059 --> 46:36.859
- Wait, I'm sorry, really?
- Yeah.

46:36.861 --> 46:38.294
Like, for good?

46:38.296 --> 46:39.929
I don't know, maybe.

46:39.931 --> 46:41.197
I mean, for awhile, yeah.

46:42.867 --> 46:44.367
What about California?

46:44.369 --> 46:48.171
I got a job offer in New York, 
so I had to come home.

46:48.173 --> 46:49.505
[Becky] What is it?

46:49.507 --> 46:51.974
A development deal
with Snapchat.

46:51.976 --> 46:54.010
Supposedly, 
I'm a social media influencer.

46:54.012 --> 46:55.261
Really?

46:55.262 --> 46:56.511
But you seem to be 
doing incredible.

46:56.514 --> 46:58.314
Oh my goodness, I've seen all
these things on Instagram.

46:58.316 --> 46:59.482
Iceland, you went to Iceland.

46:59.484 --> 47:01.184
Wow, you've really 
been looking, huh?

47:01.186 --> 47:02.819
Oh yeah, I'm a fucking troll.

47:02.821 --> 47:04.086
I'm on it constantly.

47:04.088 --> 47:06.956
And I saw that you 
married Owen.

47:06.958 --> 47:08.224
Yeah.

47:08.226 --> 47:09.158
I did.

47:10.094 --> 47:11.294
You guys look happy.

47:16.034 --> 47:17.033
Yeah.

47:17.034 --> 47:18.033
Anyway, I gotta get outta here.

47:18.036 --> 47:19.602
Yeah.

47:19.603 --> 47:21.169
I gotta, well, I have to--

47:21.172 --> 47:23.439
Yeah, I was literally, I was,
okay.

47:25.109 --> 47:26.075
Scott fucking Rollins.

47:26.077 --> 47:27.376
Becky fucking Brooks.

47:32.050 --> 47:33.449
Let me get this straight, 
you're telling me

47:33.451 --> 47:37.920
that she's gonna leave her
husband because of a yeah?

47:37.922 --> 47:39.455
No, by the way, 
it's not how she said it.

47:39.457 --> 47:42.258
It wasn't just a yeah, 
it was like a cry for help.

47:42.260 --> 47:43.526
Oh man.

47:43.528 --> 47:45.928
You have got to learn to manage 
your expectations.

47:45.930 --> 47:47.864
No, I'm gonna dive deep
into this one.

47:47.866 --> 47:50.199
I'm gonna really latch
onto this one.

47:50.201 --> 47:51.868
How do you have this?

47:51.870 --> 47:53.035
I taped it the other night.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.370
- Yes, did you really?
- Yeah.

47:54.372 --> 47:56.339
'86 Mets, one of the best
teams in sports history.

47:56.341 --> 47:57.240
Thank you.

47:57.241 --> 47:58.140
And I'm not talking baseball.

47:58.142 --> 47:59.041
I'm talking all of sports.

47:59.043 --> 48:00.743
Hit me off with it.

48:00.744 --> 48:02.444
What have we got, Gary Carter, 
Lenny Dykstra--

48:02.447 --> 48:05.181
- Keith Hernandez, Darryl--
- Darryl Strawberry.

48:05.183 --> 48:06.766
- Big Lefty.
- Mookie.

48:06.767 --> 48:08.350
- Mookie.
- And against Bill Buckner.

48:08.353 --> 48:09.485
G-g-g-gosh.

48:09.487 --> 48:11.120
What was that pitcher's name?

48:12.223 --> 48:13.990
- Ron Darling.
- That was, yeah.

48:13.992 --> 48:14.991
- From Yale.
- Very smart man.

48:14.993 --> 48:16.025
- Really smart kid.
- Yeah.

48:16.027 --> 48:17.627
My son was five.

48:17.629 --> 48:20.396
I'd say, "Who's pitching"
and he'd go, Darling.

48:20.398 --> 48:21.898
Yeah, yeah.

48:21.900 --> 48:23.099
Yeah, they were great.

48:23.101 --> 48:25.935
Speaking of great, 
my pancakes.

48:25.937 --> 48:27.403
- Oh my god, unbelievable.
- Great?

48:27.405 --> 48:28.871
You do a lot of cooking?

48:28.872 --> 48:30.338
I used to, you know,
when the kids were young.

48:30.341 --> 48:32.608
Breakfast mostly, but now,
not so much.

48:32.610 --> 48:34.377
Yeah.

48:34.378 --> 48:36.145
I'm not that well-stocked
in the grocery department.

48:36.147 --> 48:38.014
So what is it, 
just blueberries and beer?

48:38.016 --> 48:39.265
- And bourbon.
- Oh.

48:39.266 --> 48:40.515
And I've got some Jager
in the fridge.

48:40.518 --> 48:42.318
So you cover all the basic 
food groups.

48:42.320 --> 48:43.286
Just the essentials, you know.

48:43.288 --> 48:44.553
- Well, okay.
- Yeah.

48:47.358 --> 48:48.991
Are they organic blueberries?

48:48.993 --> 48:51.560
- Long Island's own.
- Oh my god, I could taste it.

48:52.330 --> 48:53.407
What are you doing?

48:53.408 --> 48:54.485
You brought up bourbon.

48:54.486 --> 48:55.563
You know, just put me
in the mood, that's all.

48:55.566 --> 48:57.934
- No, you brought up bourbon.
- All right.

48:59.437 --> 49:00.369
Fine.

49:01.339 --> 49:02.705
You're no fun.

49:02.707 --> 49:05.474
Yeah, I've been hearing
that a lot lately.

49:05.476 --> 49:08.144
To get back to what's 
important, right?

49:08.146 --> 49:10.279
I'm there, I'm right in
front of Becky,

49:10.281 --> 49:12.298
and I ask her, I said,
"You guys look happy."

49:12.299 --> 49:14.316
And then she says, now listen
to the way she says it, okay?

49:14.319 --> 49:15.551
She goes, yeah.

49:15.553 --> 49:17.587
That wasn't it, 
that wasn't even it.

49:17.588 --> 49:19.622
It was like this, it was like 
imagine someone about to die,

49:19.624 --> 49:22.191
die inside, it was like, yeah.

49:22.193 --> 49:23.326
That was it, did you hear it?

49:23.328 --> 49:24.694
- No, I hear nothing.
- Oh my--

49:24.696 --> 49:26.062
I hear absolutely nothing.

49:26.064 --> 49:28.731
Listen, Rollins, existing
marriage aside--

49:28.733 --> 49:31.133
Terrible marriage aside,
but continue.

49:31.135 --> 49:32.902
Okay.

49:32.903 --> 49:34.670
She said, he's the one,
he's the one.

49:34.672 --> 49:36.305
All right, that's cool, I get that.

49:36.307 --> 49:38.174
But is she the one for you?

49:38.176 --> 49:40.326
I mean, maybe.

49:40.327 --> 49:42.477
It doesn't mean she's not
the right one for me, right?

49:42.480 --> 49:46.082
All I'm trying to say is lightning 
rarely strikes twice.

49:46.084 --> 49:47.550
But if you keep your eyes 
open and you're not

49:47.552 --> 49:50.052
a little stubborn shit,
it can strike again.

49:50.054 --> 49:52.088
Wow, what does that mean,
Drunk Yoda?

49:52.757 --> 49:54.423
It means what it means.

49:54.425 --> 49:56.692
Holy shit, is that your 
Yoda impersonation?

49:56.694 --> 49:57.727
What the fuck is this?

49:57.729 --> 49:59.729
Well, it's not my world.

50:00.598 --> 50:02.048
What I'm trying to say is

50:02.049 --> 50:03.499
what if I fucked 
with destiny,right?

50:03.501 --> 50:05.134
What if I zigged when
I should have zagged?

50:05.136 --> 50:07.136
My entire life would be different.

50:07.138 --> 50:08.704
And speaking personally,

50:08.706 --> 50:13.175
I actually do think that
you can unfuck something.

50:15.179 --> 50:16.112
Yeah?

50:21.085 --> 50:24.387
Do you know I'm going up
again tomorrow.

50:24.389 --> 50:25.788
Going up, 
what does that mean?

50:25.790 --> 50:27.390
I'm making a comeback.

50:27.392 --> 50:29.058
I'm going to Levittown.

50:29.059 --> 50:30.725
A place called Governor's,
I'm gonna do some standup.

50:30.728 --> 50:32.094
- Great.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

50:32.096 --> 50:33.329
- Oh, I love that.
- For real?

50:33.331 --> 50:34.730
I told, oh, that's fantastic.

50:34.732 --> 50:36.165
- What, tomorrow night?
- 7:00 p.m. tomorrow night.

50:36.167 --> 50:37.466
But I don't know when
I'm in the lineup.

50:37.468 --> 50:38.701
So the show starts at 7:00 p.m.

50:38.703 --> 50:39.680
I'm somewhere in there.

50:39.681 --> 50:40.658
They gave me a shitty slot

50:40.659 --> 50:41.636
because I haven't been
there for a bit.

50:41.639 --> 50:42.705
- I'll be there.
- For real?

50:42.707 --> 50:44.306
- Yeah.
- Three drink minimum.

50:44.308 --> 50:45.641
I'm worried about 
the drink maximum.

50:45.643 --> 50:47.777
You can also drink like 
a Coke or a coffee.

50:47.779 --> 50:49.245
The caffeine will kill me.

50:49.246 --> 50:50.712
My heart will be beating
like a hummingbird.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.248
You're worried about
the caffeine killing you?

50:52.250 --> 50:53.749
- Yeah.
- Shit, yeah.

51:00.324 --> 51:04.660
Is it weird if I ask you 
who is in that?

51:08.800 --> 51:13.569
No, that's Catherine,
that's wife number two.

51:15.173 --> 51:16.405
And where's wife number one?

51:17.542 --> 51:20.276
She's buried in a cemetery 
in Farmingdale.

51:20.278 --> 51:21.243
Mount Ararat.

51:23.181 --> 51:26.282
Catherine hated the thought
of being put into the ground.

51:26.284 --> 51:27.216
So...

51:28.186 --> 51:29.218
I dig that, yeah.

51:31.589 --> 51:33.255
How did she die?

51:33.257 --> 51:36.759
You know, Rollins, I just
don't like to talk about it.

51:38.796 --> 51:39.795
I get it.

51:42.233 --> 51:44.567
She had stomach cancer,
ate her alive.

51:47.105 --> 51:49.171
You know, I didn't drink once

51:49.173 --> 51:50.506
all the years that 
we were married.

51:50.508 --> 51:51.874
Not once.

51:51.876 --> 51:52.808
Not a drop.

51:54.579 --> 51:55.511
Didn't have to.

51:59.617 --> 52:02.151
(somber music)

52:02.153 --> 52:03.586
What are you doing now?

52:03.588 --> 52:05.188
It's Tuesday afternoon,

52:05.189 --> 52:06.789
I'm eating pancakes with
my dermatologist.

52:06.791 --> 52:10.359
Well, get up.

52:10.361 --> 52:12.261
- Get up, we going somewhere?
- Yeah.

52:12.263 --> 52:14.196
- Where we going?
- Field trip.

52:14.198 --> 52:16.866
(pleasant music)
I can't believe my

52:44.495 --> 52:48.597
dermatologist drives 
Snoop Dogg's car.

52:48.599 --> 52:51.267
She's a cliz-assic.

52:51.269 --> 52:52.334
- Did I get it right?
- Yeah.

52:52.336 --> 52:53.502
That's exactly how he says it.

52:53.504 --> 52:54.670
- See?
- Cliz-assic.

52:54.672 --> 52:56.238
I'm down with that.

53:08.753 --> 53:10.686
You sure about this?

53:12.490 --> 53:13.422
[Marty] Yeah.

53:14.825 --> 53:15.891
All right.

53:17.828 --> 53:22.698
You know, it's been,
fuck me, three years.

53:24.936 --> 53:26.702
And I would've done this earlier

53:26.703 --> 53:28.469
but I didn't have anybody 
to do it with me.

53:30.441 --> 53:31.974
And the thought of an old man 
out on the beach

53:31.976 --> 53:33.709
spreading ashes around
just seemed so--

53:33.711 --> 53:36.595
Sad, yeah.

53:36.596 --> 53:39.480
I was gonna say cliche but, 
sad is not inaccurate.

53:40.985 --> 53:42.685
Listen, if you wanna say 
some words out there,

53:42.687 --> 53:43.852
I could just stay here.

53:45.523 --> 53:47.256
She knew what she meant to me.

53:48.693 --> 53:50.176
I was the husband to her

53:50.177 --> 53:51.660
that I couldn't be to my first wife.

53:55.900 --> 53:57.600
Anne.

53:57.602 --> 53:59.301
Poor Anne, she had
so many problems.

53:59.303 --> 54:00.669
She suffered from depression.

54:00.671 --> 54:02.538
I mean, clinical depression.

54:02.540 --> 54:04.406
It's a horrible disease.

54:06.310 --> 54:10.913
To love someone who lives
in such a dark space

54:10.915 --> 54:13.716
that they can't possibly
love you back,

54:13.718 --> 54:17.620
to try and fail every day, 
it was impossible.

54:17.622 --> 54:20.389
I just felt lost and I tried.

54:20.391 --> 54:21.357
I just...

54:22.293 --> 54:24.093
Fuck.

54:24.094 --> 54:25.894
It takes a lot stronger
person than I was then.

54:29.934 --> 54:31.533
But today's not about Anne.

54:31.535 --> 54:33.969
Today's about Catherine.

54:33.971 --> 54:37.606
And, all right, baby.

54:40.845 --> 54:41.910
Let's rock and roll.

54:43.481 --> 54:44.413
Let's do it.

54:46.384 --> 54:49.018
(pleasant music)

55:00.598 --> 55:02.498
[Child] Where's my wallet,
Frank?

55:02.500 --> 55:04.600
Hey, what did I tell you 
about that?

55:04.602 --> 55:06.502
It's Dad, I'm your dad.

55:06.504 --> 55:07.936
Now where did you 
put my wallet?

55:07.938 --> 55:09.505
I want Burger King.

55:09.507 --> 55:10.939
Yeah, well you know what?

55:10.941 --> 55:13.509
I want a time machine
and some condoms.

55:13.511 --> 55:15.744
But I, you know what, 
I didn't mean that.

55:15.746 --> 55:17.546
I didn't, I'm sorry.

55:32.430 --> 55:33.829
- Oh.
- For real?

55:33.831 --> 55:35.197
[Jeanine] Oh, I'm sorry, honey.

55:35.198 --> 55:36.564
I thought maybe something 
was wrong.

55:36.567 --> 55:38.033
No, why would you think that?

55:38.034 --> 55:39.500
[Jeanine] Well, you've been 
in there an awful--

55:39.503 --> 55:41.370
- Mom, close the door.
- Okay, sorry, honey.

55:41.372 --> 55:42.471
- Bye.
- Bye.

55:43.908 --> 55:46.475
Jesus Christ.

55:46.477 --> 55:49.545
Welcome to Do the Twist,
can I help you, sir?

55:49.547 --> 55:51.847
Yeah, I'll have an unsalted 
and babe?

55:53.684 --> 55:57.553
Oh, um, just a Parmesan
and garlic, please.

55:57.555 --> 55:58.620
- Thank you.
- Okay.

55:58.622 --> 56:00.823
[Megan] Oh shit, look who it is.

56:00.825 --> 56:01.757
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:01.759 --> 56:02.624
Hi.

56:02.626 --> 56:03.792
Long time no see.

56:03.794 --> 56:05.728
Oh, Owen, you remember Meg,
right?

56:05.730 --> 56:06.962
Um, Scott's sister?

56:06.964 --> 56:09.465
Oh yeah, right, hi, Meg.

56:09.467 --> 56:10.766
Hey.

56:10.768 --> 56:12.768
Um, I love your photography.

56:12.770 --> 56:14.737
I've been seeing everything
you've been posting on Facebook.

56:14.739 --> 56:15.738
It's incredible.

56:15.740 --> 56:16.638
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.107
Thanks.

56:18.108 --> 56:19.575
- You guys got married, right?
- We did.

56:19.577 --> 56:21.077
- Yeah.
- Congrats.

56:21.078 --> 56:22.578
- Yeah, thanks.
- Oh no, those are on me.

56:22.580 --> 56:24.947
- Oh.
- Oh my gosh, thank you.

56:24.949 --> 56:26.749
- Of course.
- That's so sweet.

56:26.751 --> 56:28.517
So sorry to hear about Rory.

56:28.519 --> 56:30.853
Scott mentioned you guys 
were close.

56:30.855 --> 56:32.454
- Yeah.
- Did you hear he's home?

56:32.456 --> 56:34.056
- Who is, Scott?
- Yeah, the prodigal son

56:34.058 --> 56:35.724
returned last week.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.059
I'm seeing him tonight
at Governor's by the way.

56:37.061 --> 56:38.127
- Wait, at Governor's?
- I know.

56:38.129 --> 56:40.074
I haven't been back there

56:40.075 --> 56:42.020
since I got kicked out for yelling--

56:42.021 --> 56:43.966
My mom caught you jerking
off on my life-sized Barbie.

56:43.968 --> 56:46.769
(both laughing)

56:47.972 --> 56:49.872
Do you guys have 
any babies yet or?

56:49.874 --> 56:51.073
Oh god, no.

56:51.075 --> 56:52.408
We, not yet.

56:53.444 --> 56:55.577
Well, we should 
probably get going.

56:55.579 --> 56:57.079
Yeah, yeah, we should.

56:57.081 --> 56:58.480
It's good to see you.

57:01.619 --> 57:03.051
Give another round of applause 
again for Pet Cavalon.

57:03.053 --> 57:04.853
Pete Cavalon.

57:04.855 --> 57:06.021
All right.

57:06.023 --> 57:07.723
Yeah, that was a real funny guy.

57:07.725 --> 57:09.191
All right, let's keep
this thing rolling

57:09.193 --> 57:11.960
with Long Island's very own 
Mr. Scott Rollins.

57:11.962 --> 57:13.846
Come on up here, Scott.

57:13.847 --> 57:15.731
Come on, let him hear you, 
let him hear you.

57:15.733 --> 57:17.866
Thank you, oh please, let me.

57:17.868 --> 57:19.201
How is everybody tonight?

57:19.203 --> 57:21.670
(crowd cheers)
Good, good, good.

57:21.672 --> 57:24.740
Um, it's crazy 'cause I haven't 
been on this stage

57:24.742 --> 57:26.074
since I was in my 20s.

57:26.076 --> 57:28.977
And I am in my 30s now.

57:28.979 --> 57:30.813
I know, I know, it probably
doesn't look like it, right?

57:30.815 --> 57:32.448
I look like I'm at least mid-70s.

57:32.450 --> 57:34.716
But I am in my 30s right now

57:34.718 --> 57:36.185
and I feel like there's
so many differences

57:36.187 --> 57:38.987
between your 20s and your 30s,
'cause when I was in my 20s,

57:38.989 --> 57:40.739
I used to think to myself, oh,

57:40.740 --> 57:42.490
what am I gonna do 
this weekend, right?

57:42.493 --> 57:43.892
And now that I'm in my 30s,

57:43.894 --> 57:45.928
I'm thinking, oh, what am
I gonna do with my life?

57:45.930 --> 57:47.663
(crowd laughs)

57:47.665 --> 57:50.566
♪ We're not gonna take it ♪

57:50.568 --> 57:53.735
♪ No, we ain't gonna take it ♪

57:53.737 --> 57:58.240
♪ We're not gonna
take it anymore ♪

57:58.242 --> 57:59.241
Hey, when am I up?

57:59.243 --> 58:00.487
They're horrible.

58:00.488 --> 58:01.732
You were just up.

58:01.733 --> 58:02.977
Yeah, but I put in for like 
six things, you know?

58:02.980 --> 58:04.446
Come on, I gotta go.

58:04.447 --> 58:05.913
Yeah, congratulations, there
are other people before you.

58:05.916 --> 58:07.015
We go through this every week.

58:07.017 --> 58:08.817
Hey, hey, hey, stop that,
stop that.

58:08.819 --> 58:10.486
I don't remember 
what I put in for.

58:10.488 --> 58:11.854
Did I do "Weevils of London"
yet?

58:11.856 --> 58:13.021
Again, we don't have that.

58:13.023 --> 58:14.089
How could you not have...

58:14.091 --> 58:15.958
- Seriously, Marty?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

58:15.959 --> 58:17.826
- What the fuck?
- No, I got it, sorry.

58:17.828 --> 58:19.761
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, hey.

58:19.763 --> 58:21.730
Maybe you should just go home.

58:21.732 --> 58:23.032
I am home.

58:23.033 --> 58:24.333
Everybody knows my name.

58:24.334 --> 58:25.634
- I don't know your name.
- You know my name, Glen.

58:25.636 --> 58:26.835
Hey, come over here,

58:26.836 --> 58:28.035
we'll do a little "Mr. Roboto"
together.

58:28.038 --> 58:28.904
No way.

58:28.906 --> 58:30.328
You hog the mic.

58:30.329 --> 58:31.751
You call it hogging the mic,

58:31.752 --> 58:33.174
I call it giving the people 
what they want.

58:35.145 --> 58:37.112
You are a mic hog.

58:37.114 --> 58:39.248
But I'll sing with you.

58:39.250 --> 58:40.182
Wow.

58:41.051 --> 58:42.651
Hey, you're out, Glen.

58:42.653 --> 58:44.152
I was never in.

58:44.154 --> 58:45.087
(Marty laughs)

58:45.089 --> 58:47.556
By show of hands,

58:47.557 --> 58:50.024
who here actually lives
with their parents?

58:50.027 --> 58:51.126
Okay, that's just me,
nobody else?

58:51.128 --> 58:53.362
All right, that's fine.

58:53.363 --> 58:55.597
I feel like when you're my age 
and you can't pay rent,

58:55.599 --> 58:57.799
your only two options are live 
with your parents

58:57.801 --> 58:59.334
or become homeless.

58:59.335 --> 59:00.868
And honestly, I think I made 
the wrong choice.

59:00.871 --> 59:02.855
(crowd laughs)

59:02.856 --> 59:04.840
I do, I'd be so much 
happier, right?

59:04.842 --> 59:07.042
'Cause when you're homeless
and you're in the bathroom

59:07.044 --> 59:08.977
for more than five minutes,
your mom doesn't gently

59:08.979 --> 59:10.846
knock on the door and be like
is everything okay in there?

59:10.848 --> 59:13.715
(all laughing)

59:13.717 --> 59:14.650
Um.

59:16.554 --> 59:19.855
Um, yeah, um, my dad is,
he's not here, right?

59:19.857 --> 59:23.992
My dad is obsessed with bears, 
it's insane.

59:23.994 --> 59:26.261
And I'm almost positive it's
because he saw "The Revenant"

59:26.263 --> 59:27.963
one time and he's like, oo,
I get it.

59:27.965 --> 59:29.798
I wanna fuck a bear.

[Scott] Hey.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:19.848
[Ruis] Oh, superstar.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.183
- Come here.
- Thank you.

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:23.151
- You're a superstar, man.
- Thank you.

01:00:23.153 --> 01:00:24.086
Thank you.

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:28.690
- I mean, right?
- Yeah.

01:00:28.692 --> 01:00:30.926
You know, you.

01:00:30.928 --> 01:00:32.878
[Scott] What?

01:00:32.879 --> 01:00:34.829
Are really, really, really mediocre.

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:36.015
Wow, at the end.

01:00:36.016 --> 01:00:37.199
I thought you were gonna 
say something nice

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:38.400
and at the end, 
you just pegged it.

01:00:38.402 --> 01:00:39.701
No, wait.

01:00:39.703 --> 01:00:41.203
Screw that.

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:42.804
You were fucking great.

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:45.273
Thank you, Ruis, I appreciate it.

01:00:45.275 --> 01:00:48.310
I guess I could've laughed
like 10 seconds longer.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:49.811
You know Murph was 
supposed to be here?

01:00:49.813 --> 01:00:50.963
- Murph?
- Yes.

01:00:50.964 --> 01:00:52.114
But his kid, he said his kid 
was throwing up

01:00:52.116 --> 01:00:53.048
or something like that.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:53.981
Oh, the classic the parent line.

01:00:53.984 --> 01:00:55.150
Fine, fine.

01:00:55.151 --> 01:00:56.317
One of my other friends
was supposed to come

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.220
but I don't know what happened.

01:00:58.222 --> 01:01:00.989
- Oh, don't worry about it.
- It was good, right?

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:01.990
- Yeah.
- It was, right?

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:03.842
- Yeah.
- It's different.

01:01:03.843 --> 01:01:05.693
'Cause in California, it's all 
depressing all the time.

01:01:05.696 --> 01:01:08.196
But here, yes, it was snapping 
and it all felt good.

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:09.931
Yeah, well you know,
you got that whole

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:11.299
New York asshole thing
going on for you.

01:01:11.301 --> 01:01:13.735
I am sorry, was that
another compliment?

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:15.837
I, no, because I called 
you an asshole.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:19.141
- Right, it felt good.
- You were so funny.

01:01:20.010 --> 01:01:22.177
Thank you, I appreciate it.

01:01:22.179 --> 01:01:23.412
Thanks.

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:25.947
- Come on.
- Thanks for coming.

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:29.251
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:01:29.253 --> 01:01:31.019
You got groupies, man.

01:01:32.690 --> 01:01:33.989
Marry him, please.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.289
Why are you not just marrying 
him immediately?

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:37.426
He's incredibly supportive of me.

01:01:37.428 --> 01:01:38.160
Are you done?

01:01:38.162 --> 01:01:39.478
I'm done, yes.

01:01:39.479 --> 01:01:40.795
[Megan] We're going to the
Whale's Tail for a drink.

01:01:40.798 --> 01:01:43.065
- You wanna come?
- Let's go.

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:45.333
I think I'm gonna go home,
work on some of my jokes.

01:01:45.335 --> 01:01:46.435
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:49.838
- That's good, man.
- You do you.

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.139
That's fucking awesome.

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:52.474
- Focus, right?
- I'm doing it.

01:01:52.476 --> 01:01:53.909
- Focus.
- Focus, just like you said.

01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:55.310
- Me too.
- I love you, Ruis.

01:01:55.312 --> 01:01:56.912
- I love you, Ruis.
- I love you too, Scotty.

01:01:56.914 --> 01:01:59.314
- Goodbye, good job.
- I'll see you later, man.

01:02:05.956 --> 01:02:08.824
(phone clicking)

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.098
(phone dings)

01:02:28.946 --> 01:02:32.013
(machines groaning)

01:02:52.469 --> 01:02:56.004
(acoustic guitar music)

01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:47.122
(phone beeping)

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.961
(phone ringing)

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:00.786
[Scott] Hey, this is Scott.

01:04:00.787 --> 01:04:02.204
Leave a message after the beep.

01:04:04.141 --> 01:04:05.106
[Voicemail Woman] At the tone,

01:04:05.108 --> 01:04:06.541
please record your message.

01:04:06.543 --> 01:04:08.410
When you finish recording,
you may hang up

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:10.445
or press one for more options.

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:13.448
Scott, it's Marty.

01:04:13.450 --> 01:04:16.084
I'm really sorry I missed
your show last night, kid.

01:04:16.086 --> 01:04:17.285
I really wanted to be there.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:19.087
I planned on it.

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:22.591
But work was, 
it was a lot yesterday.

01:04:22.593 --> 01:04:25.060
And I got home and I just fell 
asleep on the couch.

01:04:25.062 --> 01:04:26.394
I just, you know...

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:31.566
You know what, Rollins,
that was bullshit.

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.134
That was just bullshit.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:37.172
The truth is the night
got away from me

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:38.940
and I'm really sorry that it did.

01:04:40.544 --> 01:04:44.579
But I will be at the next one, 
I promise you that, okay?

01:04:45.449 --> 01:04:46.548
All right.

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:47.582
Let's talk soon.

01:04:49.019 --> 01:04:50.085
This is Marty.

01:04:51.255 --> 01:04:52.187
All right.

01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:57.259
(sighs)

01:05:01.265 --> 01:05:03.899
Are you still doing 
photography or?

01:05:03.901 --> 01:05:04.566
That's stupid.

01:05:04.568 --> 01:05:05.500
Hey, Becky.

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:07.569
Hey, Becky.

01:05:07.571 --> 01:05:09.504
Hey, Becky, long time.

01:05:10.941 --> 01:05:12.274
- Hey, Scotty.
- So we're never gonna be

01:05:12.276 --> 01:05:13.242
a knocking family, are we?

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:14.209
Well, I just wanted to see

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:15.577
if you wanted some
hot chocolate.

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:16.944
I'm making some for your 
father and me.

01:05:16.947 --> 01:05:17.679
Ma.

01:05:19.483 --> 01:05:21.016
Oh, look at you.

01:05:21.952 --> 01:05:23.418
Do you have a job
interview today?

01:05:23.420 --> 01:05:25.387
No, I'm just getting
lunch with a friend.

01:05:25.389 --> 01:05:26.988
Oh, is this a date?

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:29.124
No, Mom, it's not a date.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:30.659
Well, would you want some 
hot chocolate before you go?

01:05:30.661 --> 01:05:32.060
No, no no no.

01:05:32.062 --> 01:05:34.029
Unless, do we have those 
tiny marshmallows?

01:05:34.031 --> 01:05:36.531
Scotty, you know I always have 
those tiny marshmallows.

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:39.200
I would love some hot chocolate.

01:05:39.202 --> 01:05:41.937
Yeah.

01:05:41.939 --> 01:05:44.506
- Mom, do I look all right?
- You look so handsome.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:53.114
(dog barking)

01:06:20.444 --> 01:06:23.378
(leaves rustling)

01:06:37.060 --> 01:06:37.726
Don't.

01:06:37.728 --> 01:06:38.593
Marty, just turn around.

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:39.661
Come on.

01:06:39.663 --> 01:06:41.730
Adam, I just want to talk to you.

01:06:41.732 --> 01:06:43.231
I mean, what do you 
want me to do?

01:06:43.233 --> 01:06:44.766
I want you to never 
show up at my house

01:06:44.768 --> 01:06:47.369
or my job or anywhere 
else where I may be.

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:49.104
And yes, that includes 
friends' wakes.

01:06:49.106 --> 01:06:50.772
I mean, seriously,
what the fuck?

01:06:50.774 --> 01:06:52.257
I always liked Rory.

01:06:52.258 --> 01:06:53.741
He was a good kid and 
I felt bad about him

01:06:53.744 --> 01:06:55.744
but I really wanted to see you.

01:06:55.746 --> 01:06:59.481
Hey, Jules, I'll be in 
in one minute, okay, pal?

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:02.250
- Backwards hug.
- Backwards hug.

01:07:02.252 --> 01:07:04.185
I'm gonna be in there in 
one minute okay, pal?

01:07:04.187 --> 01:07:06.154
- Okay.
- All right.

01:07:11.795 --> 01:07:12.761
He got big.

01:07:13.797 --> 01:07:15.430
Yeah, kids do that.

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:17.232
I made blueberry pancakes,
they're in the car.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:18.467
I thought maybe we could have--

01:07:18.468 --> 01:07:19.701
Nobody wants your
fucking pancakes.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:22.270
Now just turn around, get back 
in your ridiculous car--

01:07:22.272 --> 01:07:23.304
I'm his grandfather.

01:07:23.306 --> 01:07:25.607
No, Marty, you're not.

01:07:25.609 --> 01:07:27.442
There's no reason for him 
to know you.

01:07:27.444 --> 01:07:29.744
Adam, I can't fix this if you 
don't give me a chance.

01:07:29.746 --> 01:07:32.080
I don't want you to fix anything.

01:07:32.082 --> 01:07:34.682
- My mother--
- Ate a bottle of pills.

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:35.383
Yeah, she did.

01:07:35.385 --> 01:07:40.255
Because it was just too painful
for her to be here anymore.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.427
And listen, your mother,
God rest her soul--

01:07:45.429 --> 01:07:47.429
12 years ago, last week.

01:07:47.431 --> 01:07:48.296
Did you know that?

01:07:48.298 --> 01:07:49.697
Yeah, of course.

01:07:51.668 --> 01:07:52.901
Of course I know.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:54.135
Your mother was 
a very sick person.

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:57.238
It had nothing to do with me.

01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.473
Every time I'd walk
in the house,

01:07:58.475 --> 01:08:00.408
she'd disappear just 
a little bit more

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.243
every day until she was gone.

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:05.613
And I tried to help her, I did, 
but I couldn't do it.

01:08:05.615 --> 01:08:07.115
It got to the point where
I couldn't walk

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:08.650
into the house sober anymore.

01:08:08.652 --> 01:08:09.684
I'm sorry.

01:08:10.554 --> 01:08:11.719
I know what I did.

01:08:11.721 --> 01:08:12.587
I know who I was.

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:13.755
No.

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:15.390
No, there's no past
tense with you.

01:08:15.392 --> 01:08:17.225
You knew she was sick.

01:08:17.227 --> 01:08:18.859
You just said you knew and 
you still fucked another woman.

01:08:18.862 --> 01:08:20.862
I didn't just fuck another woman.

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.564
Catherine was not just
another woman.

01:08:22.566 --> 01:08:24.099
I fell in love, I'm sorry.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.433
No, you cheated.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.835
And you drank and you gambled.

01:08:26.837 --> 01:08:28.470
And I'm ashamed of all of that.

01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:29.404
Good.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.573
I'm sorry, Marty, but
I'm not gonna

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:35.376
give you what you're
looking for today.

01:08:35.377 --> 01:08:36.743
Okay?

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:37.679
Okay.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.718
Why can't you just talk
to me like a person?

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:45.553
You know?

01:08:47.124 --> 01:08:47.889
10 minutes.

01:08:51.428 --> 01:08:53.428
Can't someone 
unfuck something?

01:09:01.171 --> 01:09:02.303
Not you.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.238
Not now.

01:09:08.678 --> 01:09:11.279
(Marty sobs)

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:22.756
(window tapping)

01:09:27.796 --> 01:09:28.729
Hey.

01:09:31.768 --> 01:09:34.636
(Marty whimpers)

01:10:02.199 --> 01:10:02.730
Hey.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:06.534
Hey, can I ask you 
a question real quick?

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:07.468
Sure.

01:10:08.772 --> 01:10:12.240
- Do you like your job?
- Oh, I love it.

01:10:12.242 --> 01:10:14.709
- Really?
- It's the greatest job.

01:10:14.711 --> 01:10:16.544
I might be the happiest
mailman in the world.

01:10:16.546 --> 01:10:17.812
(both chuckling)

01:10:17.814 --> 01:10:19.948
- You like it?
- It's a great job.

01:10:19.950 --> 01:10:21.549
Have a great day.

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:23.484
You for real love your job?

01:10:23.486 --> 01:10:24.519
It's fantastic.

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:25.954
- Are you interested?
- No.

01:10:25.956 --> 01:10:26.888
Okay.

01:10:32.295 --> 01:10:34.996
This is like a real adult house.

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:37.732
Says the 34 year old man.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.234
Yeah with the emotional
maturity level

01:10:39.236 --> 01:10:40.702
of a 13 year old boy.

01:10:40.704 --> 01:10:41.636
Mm.

01:10:43.406 --> 01:10:44.439
Yeah, I mean, I like it.

01:10:44.441 --> 01:10:47.008
It's a little big, I guess.

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:51.679
But I mean, like, there's
a guitar just chilling

01:10:51.681 --> 01:10:52.780
in the living room, you know?

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:54.983
What is that there for?

01:10:54.985 --> 01:10:56.351
It's like, I don't play.

01:10:56.353 --> 01:10:57.719
Owen doesn't play.

01:10:57.721 --> 01:10:58.953
It's just sitting there.

01:10:59.956 --> 01:11:01.823
I don't know, he
thinks it's classy.

01:11:01.825 --> 01:11:02.890
It is classy.

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:04.392
That is very classy.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:05.893
When I came in, I was like,
I don't know about this...

01:11:05.895 --> 01:11:08.329
Oh, this is a classy place.

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:09.998
Know what I mean?
Yeah, totally.

01:11:13.336 --> 01:11:14.802
- Thanks for the tea.
- Yeah.

01:11:18.475 --> 01:11:19.407
Um.

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.710
How's your photography going?

01:11:24.047 --> 01:11:25.847
I don't know, you tell me.

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:27.048
That's you?

01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:29.317
- Those are you photographs?
- Yes.

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:30.952
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:32.820
[Scott] These are amazing.

01:11:32.822 --> 01:11:34.322
That one, actually, 
the one on the left,

01:11:34.324 --> 01:11:35.957
that was in The New Yorker 
recently.

01:11:35.959 --> 01:11:37.959
- This was in The New Yorker?
- Yeah.

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:39.627
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.663
You just nonchalantly
throw that out there?

01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:44.032
- That's incredible.
- Thanks.

01:11:44.034 --> 01:11:46.634
And Owen seems 
to be doing well, right?

01:11:46.636 --> 01:11:48.603
I heard he's a full-fledged
lawyer now, so...

01:11:48.605 --> 01:11:49.637
He is.

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.556
Yep.

01:11:51.557 --> 01:11:53.474
He is entertainment law, so...

01:11:53.476 --> 01:11:56.377
Hey, maybe you could 
use him one time.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.546
Maybe not.

01:11:58.548 --> 01:11:59.480
No?

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.416
Why not?

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:03.017
- What about the um--
- The development deal?

01:12:03.019 --> 01:12:05.670
Yeah.

01:12:05.671 --> 01:12:08.322
That was actually a lie I told 
to try to impress you.

01:12:09.059 --> 01:12:10.892
I know, it's stupid.

01:12:10.894 --> 01:12:15.663
That's apparently a
new wrinkle in my life.

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:17.899
I'm a liar now, so...

01:12:18.735 --> 01:12:19.734
I'm confused.

01:12:19.736 --> 01:12:20.885
Well, Becks--

01:12:20.886 --> 01:12:22.035
No one's called me that in years.

01:12:29.512 --> 01:12:31.779
Scott, what happened to us?

01:12:31.781 --> 01:12:33.414
Wow, we're just going for it?

01:12:33.416 --> 01:12:34.649
Well, I mean, I don't know.

01:12:34.651 --> 01:12:36.551
We could continue
bullshitting back and forth.

01:12:36.553 --> 01:12:37.518
No, you're right, you're right,

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.454
you're right, you're right.

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:41.389
It's just a loaded question.

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:42.523
I don't know.

01:12:42.525 --> 01:12:44.559
About time.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:46.594
I've been wanting to ask you
that for like four years now.

01:12:47.764 --> 01:12:50.465
In my eyes, we were great.

01:12:50.467 --> 01:12:51.766
Yeah.

01:12:51.768 --> 01:12:55.103
Then you just hit 
the self-destruct button.

01:12:57.707 --> 01:13:01.542
There was no fight, 
no conversation.

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:02.844
- You just--
- Disappeared.

01:13:06.483 --> 01:13:08.850
You wouldn't even
respond to texts.

01:13:08.852 --> 01:13:10.385
- I know.
- What is that?

01:13:10.387 --> 01:13:12.620
Like just like one 
word responses?

01:13:12.622 --> 01:13:16.057
Like, yeah, sorry?

01:13:17.093 --> 01:13:18.793
Do you know how
infuriating that is?

01:13:20.063 --> 01:13:22.430
I mean, I was getting bits
and pieces of information

01:13:22.432 --> 01:13:24.465
from whatever friends
we still had.

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:27.402
But I was just trying 
to piece together

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:28.903
what I could have 
possibly done that--

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:30.405
You didn't do anything,
you didn't do anything.

01:13:30.407 --> 01:13:31.906
I swear to you.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:35.042
I just saw all of our
friends coupling up

01:13:35.044 --> 01:13:37.145
and getting married and I saw 
my own life trajectory.

01:13:37.147 --> 01:13:38.813
I saw the whole thing.

01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:42.450
Marriage, house, kids,
and it terrified me.

01:13:42.452 --> 01:13:44.652
Yeah, see, I saw all that too.

01:13:46.456 --> 01:13:47.789
But I was excited by it.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:50.691
I should have been excited.

01:13:52.862 --> 01:13:54.662
I should have been
excited, but I got scared.

01:13:54.664 --> 01:13:57.999
And when I get scared,
I run away.

01:14:00.804 --> 01:14:02.069
[Becky] Fuck.

01:14:07.977 --> 01:14:09.177
What if I never left?

01:14:13.716 --> 01:14:16.451
(both panting)

01:14:39.976 --> 01:14:40.908
Hey, what?

01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:47.748
What the hell, Scott?

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:49.016
- I'm sorry, okay?
- You're running again.

01:14:49.018 --> 01:14:50.084
- No.
- You're like literally

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:51.151
- running down the stairs.
- No no no,

01:14:51.154 --> 01:14:52.153
but it's a good run, okay?

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.153
I think I just had an epiphany.

01:14:53.156 --> 01:14:54.589
[Becky] What epiphany?

01:14:54.590 --> 01:14:56.023
What are you talking about?

01:14:56.025 --> 01:14:58.226
I can't keep letting my bad
decisions mess up your life.

01:14:58.228 --> 01:15:00.495
It's not fair, okay?

01:15:00.497 --> 01:15:02.730
No, this is right, okay?

01:15:02.732 --> 01:15:03.931
You're right for me.

01:15:04.801 --> 01:15:06.968
We fit together, we always have.

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:09.604
No, we haven't.

01:15:12.141 --> 01:15:13.074
Fuck you.

01:15:15.078 --> 01:15:16.010
I'm sorry.

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.957
(door slams)

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:30.892
Fuck me.

01:15:32.695 --> 01:15:33.861
You son of a bitch.

01:15:33.863 --> 01:15:34.996
I swear, Owen...

01:15:34.998 --> 01:15:36.864
Fuck.

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:43.070
Dude, I swear it's not
what it looks like.

01:15:43.072 --> 01:15:44.522
[Owen] Bullshit.

01:15:44.523 --> 01:15:45.973
God, you run like 
the fucking Terminator.

01:15:45.975 --> 01:15:48.175
I ran track in high school,
you moron.

01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:53.214
(both panting)

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:11.332
(Owen panting)

01:16:21.844 --> 01:16:22.777
The pool?

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:25.012
Haven't you ever seen "Cops"?

01:16:25.014 --> 01:16:26.347
No no no, listen to me.

01:16:27.951 --> 01:16:29.684
- Ah.
- Owen.

01:16:29.686 --> 01:16:32.687
Shit.
(Scott groans)

01:16:32.689 --> 01:16:33.821
Ah, fuck.

01:16:33.823 --> 01:16:35.723
I've never been punched before.

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:37.592
Ah, I've never punched
anyone before.

01:16:37.594 --> 01:16:39.093
I think you broke my nose.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:41.596
I think you broke my hand.

01:16:50.139 --> 01:16:52.239
I knew that this would
happen eventually.

01:16:55.645 --> 01:16:57.612
I even had a nightmare about it.

01:16:57.614 --> 01:16:59.080
You had a nightmare
about us fighting?

01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:00.715
Not about us fighting.

01:17:03.686 --> 01:17:04.752
About losing her.

01:17:06.889 --> 01:17:10.758
I swear, nobody wanted you 
to succeed in LA more than I did.

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.960
I knew that the better
off you were out there,

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:15.162
the happier I would be here.

01:17:15.164 --> 01:17:16.764
I don't know what to say, man.

01:17:16.766 --> 01:17:18.866
I didn't mean to hurt--

01:17:18.867 --> 01:17:20.967
Honestly, Scott, I don't care 
what you have to say.

01:17:22.271 --> 01:17:25.006
But I am gonna go see 
what she has to say.

01:17:31.648 --> 01:17:35.016
Scott, no man wants 
the woman he loves

01:17:35.018 --> 01:17:37.251
to have a one that got away.
I know that we used to be

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:40.187
friends and this is a small town,

01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:43.724
but I truly hope I never 
see you again.

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:57.371
Marty, you beautiful bastard, 
you're a genius,

01:17:57.373 --> 01:18:00.525
do you know that?

01:18:00.526 --> 01:18:03.678
I went over to Becks' and
things got so crazy so quick.

01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.146
Give me a call back, okay?

01:18:05.148 --> 01:18:08.015
(siren whooping)

01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:15.022
(tires squeaking)

01:18:15.024 --> 01:18:16.691
(siren wailing)

01:18:16.693 --> 01:18:19.226
(somber music)

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:35.109
[Officer] Sir, 
you can't go over there.

01:18:35.111 --> 01:18:36.777
- No, that's my friend.
- Sir, I'm sorry.

01:18:36.779 --> 01:18:37.978
You're gonna have 
to stay back here.

01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:41.215
- Tell me, is he okay?
- Sir, I'm sorry.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:42.750
You're gonna have 
to stay back here.

01:18:42.752 --> 01:18:44.819
[Scott] Tell me he's okay.

01:18:44.821 --> 01:18:47.321
(somber music)

01:19:18.755 --> 01:19:20.488
And while Martin's body 
is no longer with us

01:19:21.891 --> 01:19:25.960
in a traditional sense,
his soul is everlasting.

01:19:27.964 --> 01:19:31.365
God has a plan for each
and every one of us

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:34.335
and we should all take
solace in knowing

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:37.404
that Martin is in a better place.

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:42.243
And we also find comfort
in the knowledge

01:19:42.245 --> 01:19:45.112
that none of us is 
grieving alone.

01:19:45.114 --> 01:19:47.314
- No--
- Hey, rabbi?

01:19:47.316 --> 01:19:49.083
Do you mind if I say 
a few words?

01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:52.419
All right.

01:19:52.421 --> 01:19:53.354
Sorry.

01:19:53.356 --> 01:19:54.889
Sorry, guys.

01:19:54.891 --> 01:19:55.856
Sorry about this.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:58.993
Thank you.

01:20:01.831 --> 01:20:04.465
I am just now realizing
that most of you

01:20:04.467 --> 01:20:06.967
have no idea who I am.

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:08.469
I am Scott.

01:20:08.471 --> 01:20:09.937
I was friends with Marty.

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:12.840
I didn't know him for all that long,

01:20:12.842 --> 01:20:14.341
but I got to know him really well.

01:20:14.343 --> 01:20:16.210
And I just know that when I die,

01:20:16.212 --> 01:20:19.113
I want someone who
knew me to speak.

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:24.552
I first met Marty when 
he was pissing into a sink.

01:20:24.554 --> 01:20:26.487
- Do you remember that?
- Yeah.

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.421
He was pissing in the sink 
right on his tippy toes

01:20:28.424 --> 01:20:29.557
like a weirdo.

01:20:29.559 --> 01:20:31.192
And that is classic Marty.

01:20:31.194 --> 01:20:33.216
That's classic Marty.

01:20:33.217 --> 01:20:35.239
And right when he was done,

01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:37.262
he noticed that I had a skin 
condition on my arm.

01:20:37.266 --> 01:20:39.600
And when he found out that
I couldn't pay for it,

01:20:39.602 --> 01:20:41.869
he just gave me 
the medicine for free.

01:20:41.871 --> 01:20:45.573
And I feel like that, that in
a nutshell is Marty, right?

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:49.610
He's a little bit crazy,
he talks a ton of shit.

01:20:49.612 --> 01:20:52.313
But he has an incredible heart.

01:20:52.315 --> 01:20:54.448
And he's also sneaky wise.

01:20:54.450 --> 01:20:56.083
He would say these
little nuggets,

01:20:56.085 --> 01:20:57.251
and they would just
stick with you.

01:20:57.253 --> 01:20:58.886
Like one time, he said to me,

01:20:59.989 --> 01:21:03.424
"Regret is the only
thing that's real."

01:21:03.426 --> 01:21:04.458
I regret a lot.

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:07.394
I mean, we all do, right?

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:09.129
I mean, especially you.

01:21:09.131 --> 01:21:09.997
Are you kidding me?

01:21:09.999 --> 01:21:10.965
Third row.

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:11.932
How do you, 
don't look behind you.

01:21:11.934 --> 01:21:13.451
I'm talking about you.

01:21:13.452 --> 01:21:14.969
You're wearing a Hawaiian
shirt to a funeral.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:16.437
What are you doing?

01:21:16.439 --> 01:21:18.572
(laughs)

01:21:23.913 --> 01:21:25.145
Marty was a good man.

01:21:26.649 --> 01:21:30.017
And he taught me that
people can change.

01:21:31.621 --> 01:21:34.255
And I think he was on his way 
to doing just that.

01:21:36.559 --> 01:21:38.359
I'm gonna miss him a lot.

01:21:40.096 --> 01:21:41.962
I think we're all gonna 
miss him a lot.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.566
All right, thank you.

01:21:45.568 --> 01:21:47.034
I don't even, yeah, yeah.

01:21:52.909 --> 01:21:54.375
- Thanks.
- Thank you for coming.

01:21:54.377 --> 01:21:57.378
- Thank you.
- Thank you for coming.

01:21:59.181 --> 01:22:00.681
Hey, man.

01:22:00.682 --> 01:22:02.182
I just want to say I'm sorry 
for your loss.

01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:04.151
Yeah, no.

01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:06.119
I, sorry, I forgot your name.

01:22:06.122 --> 01:22:08.122
- Scott.
- Scott, right, yeah.

01:22:08.124 --> 01:22:09.456
Your dad was a great man.

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:11.659
No.

01:22:11.661 --> 01:22:12.593
No, he wasn't.

01:22:15.197 --> 01:22:17.031
- See you.
- Yeah, see you.

01:22:23.139 --> 01:22:24.305
Are you Marty's daughter?

01:22:24.307 --> 01:22:25.506
Yeah, I'm Taylor.

01:22:26.309 --> 01:22:27.408
You the comedian?

01:22:27.410 --> 01:22:28.342
Comedian.

01:22:29.145 --> 01:22:30.411
Yeah.

01:22:30.413 --> 01:22:31.345
[Taylor] Yeah.

01:22:33.182 --> 01:22:34.315
Are you from around here or?

01:22:34.317 --> 01:22:35.649
- No, I'm a Jersey girl.
- Oh.

01:22:35.651 --> 01:22:38.185
Moved to Sparta after college.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:45.526
Um, my dad stopped by
my house the other day.

01:22:47.496 --> 01:22:49.263
A few hours before the crash.

01:22:50.366 --> 01:22:51.565
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:22:52.702 --> 01:22:53.701
It was nice.

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:57.738
Unexpected, but nice.

01:22:57.740 --> 01:23:00.240
Said he was going to
Adam's next.

01:23:00.242 --> 01:23:01.642
Did he make it over there?

01:23:02.545 --> 01:23:03.610
Adam says no.

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:11.585
When he was there,
did he seem...

01:23:13.122 --> 01:23:15.990
Drunk enough to barrel 
a Cadillac into a pizza place?

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:23.030
No, actually, fun fact,
he was stone cold sober.

01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.165
Yeah.

01:23:25.167 --> 01:23:26.266
It was a heart attack.

01:23:28.738 --> 01:23:31.271
Said he was actually
getting his shit together.

01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:37.344
I mean, not like I haven't
heard that before but...

01:23:38.781 --> 01:23:39.713
Sorry.

01:23:43.619 --> 01:23:46.286
Is it weird that 
I'm getting emotional

01:23:46.288 --> 01:23:47.721
over my dermatologist?

01:23:47.723 --> 01:23:49.056
I mean, it's your dad.

01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:54.495
I've shed plenty 
of Marty-inspired tears.

01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:56.563
Trust me.

01:24:02.238 --> 01:24:03.771
It was really nice to talk 
to you in there.

01:24:03.773 --> 01:24:04.505
Yeah.

01:24:04.507 --> 01:24:06.574
Yeah, it's kinda nice 
to know that Marty

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:08.642
had his shit together enough 
to make a new friend.

01:24:08.644 --> 01:24:10.377
Well, I wouldn't say
he had his shit together.

01:24:10.379 --> 01:24:12.679
Yeah well, who really does,
right?

01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:14.782
Right.

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:17.351
It was really nice meeting you.

01:24:17.353 --> 01:24:19.053
So nice to meet you.

01:24:21.257 --> 01:24:23.657
- Okay, I'll see you.
- Yeah.

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:24.591
Okay.

01:24:28.664 --> 01:24:30.531
Oh, hey, Scott.

01:24:30.533 --> 01:24:32.332
Do you have any good
dinner recommendations?

01:24:32.334 --> 01:24:34.535
I haven't been back on
the island in years.

01:24:36.205 --> 01:24:37.488
(both chuckling)

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:38.772
[Gary] So, Taylor, 
what do you do for a living?

01:24:38.774 --> 01:24:39.773
Me?

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:40.773
Oh, I work for the post office.

01:24:40.776 --> 01:24:42.476
- You do?
- Really?

01:24:42.478 --> 01:24:43.544
Yeah.

01:24:43.545 --> 01:24:44.611
Yeah, I mean, I don't love it,

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:45.678
but it's steady money,
good benefits.

01:24:45.681 --> 01:24:47.181
You work for the post office?

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:48.682
Yes, why are you saying it 
like that?

01:24:48.684 --> 01:24:50.818
My friend Ruis here, he works 
for the government too.

01:24:50.820 --> 01:24:52.252
Oh, is that right?

01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:53.187
Hell yeah.

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:54.721
Protect and serve.

01:24:54.723 --> 01:24:56.457
Now, I hope y'all 
are gonna like this.

01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:58.192
I'm sure it's fantastic, Mom.

01:24:58.194 --> 01:25:00.727
- But first, shall we?
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:02.331 --> 01:25:04.765
- Now, do we just drop it in?
- Yeah, you just drop it in.

01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:07.868
All right, to Marty.

01:25:09.305 --> 01:25:10.237
[All] To Marty.

01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.372
Bombs away.

01:25:14.176 --> 01:25:15.642
- You gotta drink it fast.
- Please.

01:25:22.651 --> 01:25:24.184
Give it to me.

01:25:25.888 --> 01:25:26.820
Wow.

01:25:28.190 --> 01:25:29.857
- Should we do another?
- No.

01:25:29.859 --> 01:25:32.994
Yeah.

01:25:32.995 --> 01:25:36.130
(all laughing)
(thunder rumbling)

01:25:37.133 --> 01:25:39.867
(family laughing)

01:25:47.243 --> 01:25:48.442
Hey.

01:25:48.444 --> 01:25:49.376
Hey.

01:25:50.579 --> 01:25:52.446
I saw the screen this morning.

01:25:52.448 --> 01:25:53.514
It looked good.

01:25:53.516 --> 01:25:55.215
- Got 'em all sealed.
- Yeah.

01:25:56.285 --> 01:25:57.451
That's a good stain.

01:25:58.921 --> 01:26:01.889
Think I might do the whole
front porch this summer.

01:26:01.891 --> 01:26:03.190
- Oh yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:04.193 --> 01:26:05.626
Let me know if you 
need any help.

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:07.594
I will.

01:26:12.635 --> 01:26:14.018
You know, Ruis, he said

01:26:14.019 --> 01:26:15.402
you were pretty funny
the other night.

01:26:17.439 --> 01:26:19.173
Well, Ruis is awesome.

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:21.308
He really is.

01:26:30.553 --> 01:26:31.418
- Great.
- Honey.

01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:32.619
- Yay.
- Great.
