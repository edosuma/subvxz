WEBVTT

03:51.480 --> 03:52.766
Where are you going?

03:55.200 --> 03:56.486
I won't be long.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.484
Welcome, Signor Sciarra.

05:02.920 --> 05:05.048
I trust you had a pleasant journey.

05:11.560 --> 05:12.368
Do you have it?

05:12.400 --> 05:13.890
Yes. It's over there.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.082
When do we blow the stadium?

05:22.440 --> 05:24.488
This evening at six.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.562
And the flight out of here?

05:29.560 --> 05:31.244
All arranged.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.685
And then what?

05:37.080 --> 05:40.050
Then I visit The Pale King.

05:40.800 --> 05:43.849
A toast, my friend.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.928
To Death!

05:53.120 --> 05:54.406
Bottoms up.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.522
Meet me in the square!

13:05.480 --> 13:09.724
<i>I've been here before</i>

13:12.960 --> 13:17.204
<i>But always hit the floor</i>

13:19.200 --> 13:22.602
<i>I've spent a lifetime running</i>

13:22.680 --> 13:26.366
<i>And I always get away</i>

13:26.440 --> 13:30.126
<i>But with you
I'm feeling something</i>

13:30.200 --> 13:33.886
<i>That makes me want to stay</i>

13:35.320 --> 13:40.247
<i>If I risk it all</i>

13:42.600 --> 13:47.561
<i>Could you break my fall?</i>

13:48.080 --> 13:51.801
<i>How do I live?
How do I breathe?</i>

13:51.880 --> 13:55.248
<i>When you're not here
I'm suffocating</i>

13:55.320 --> 13:58.847
<i>I want to feel love
run through my blood</i>

13:58.920 --> 14:02.766
<i>Tell me is this
where I give it all up?</i>

14:03.680 --> 14:10.086
<i>For you I have to risk it all</i>

14:11.720 --> 14:17.124
<i>'Cause the writing's
on the wall</i>

14:22.480 --> 14:27.441
<i>A million shards of glass</i>

14:29.960 --> 14:34.727
<i>That haunt me from my past</i>

14:36.120 --> 14:39.727
<i>As the stars begin to gather</i>

14:39.800 --> 14:43.407
<i>And the light begins to fade</i>

14:43.480 --> 14:47.041
<i>When all hope
begins to shatter</i>

14:47.120 --> 14:51.250
<i>Know that I won't be afraid</i>

14:52.360 --> 14:58.447
<i>If I risk it all</i>

14:59.440 --> 15:04.367
<i>Could you break my fall?</i>

15:04.880 --> 15:08.441
<i>How do I live?
How do I breathe?</i>

15:08.520 --> 15:11.967
<i>When you're not here
I'm suffocating</i>

15:12.040 --> 15:15.761
<i>I want to feel love
run through my blood</i>

15:15.840 --> 15:19.925
<i>Tell me is this
where I give it all up?</i>

15:20.000 --> 15:26.360
<i>For you I have to risk it all</i>

15:27.920 --> 15:33.370
<i>'Cause the writing's
on the wall</i>

15:36.440 --> 15:42.846
<i>The writing's on the wall</i>

15:59.360 --> 16:03.604
<i>How do I live?
How do I breathe?</i>

16:03.680 --> 16:07.162
<i>When you're not here
I'm suffocating</i>

16:07.240 --> 16:11.086
<i>I want to feel love
run through my blood</i>

16:11.160 --> 16:14.403
<i>Tell me is this
where I give it all up?</i>

16:15.400 --> 16:21.760
<i>For you I have to risk it all</i>

16:24.080 --> 16:29.928
<i>'Cause the writing's on</i>

16:32.560 --> 16:38.249
<i>The wall</i>

16:42.720 --> 16:45.644
Start anywhere you like.

16:45.760 --> 16:47.762
Take your time, 007,
but in five minutes

16:47.840 --> 16:49.046
the head of
the Joint Security Service

16:49.120 --> 16:50.360
is going to walk
through that door,

16:50.440 --> 16:51.646
and I've got
to explain to him

16:51.720 --> 16:54.963
how one of our agents decided
to potter off to Mexico, all on his own,

16:55.040 --> 16:56.724
and cause
an international incident.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.007
With all due respect, sir,
it could've been worse.

16:59.120 --> 17:01.202
Worse? You blew up
half a bloody block.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.760
Well, better half a block than
a whole stadium full of people.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.963
You had no authority.

17:06.599 --> 17:07.601
None.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.842
As you know, we're in the
middle of the biggest shakeup

17:09.920 --> 17:11.444
in the history of
British intelligence.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.285
The ink's barely dry
on this merger with MI5

17:14.359 --> 17:16.169
and already they're itching
for a chance to scrap

17:16.240 --> 17:17.890
the double-0 program forever.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.247
And you've just
given them one.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.684
You're right, sir.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.367
You have got
a tricky day ahead.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.481
This is an official question.

17:31.640 --> 17:34.803
Mexico City.
What were you doing there?

17:35.640 --> 17:39.440
It was just a coincidence.
I was taking some overdue holiday.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.650
Okay. Fine.

17:43.320 --> 17:45.971
As of this morning,
you are officially grounded.

17:46.040 --> 17:49.681
I'm standing you down
from all operations indefinitely.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.445
Very good, sir.

18:00.360 --> 18:01.805
007?

18:03.320 --> 18:04.367
Sir?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.206
I don't know what
you're playing at,

18:06.280 --> 18:08.931
but whatever it is,
it has to stop.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.001
Now.

18:12.360 --> 18:14.522
So sorry. Am I interrupting?
Not remotely.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.568
007, I'd like you
to meet Max Denbigh,

18:16.640 --> 18:18.005
head of the Joint
Security Service.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.800
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, 007.
I've heard a lot about you.

18:20.840 --> 18:22.001
Most of it good.

18:22.120 --> 18:23.565
Congratulations
on your new appointment.

18:23.640 --> 18:24.640
Thank you.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.205
I suppose we should
call you C now.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.203
No, no. "Max," please.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.802
No, I think
I'll call you C,

18:30.920 --> 18:31.921
C.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.170
As you wish.

18:34.240 --> 18:38.040
Well, my door is always open, 007,
for my employees.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.009
This merger's gonna be
a whole new chapter for us.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.801
We're going to bring
British intelligence out of the Dark Ages

18:44.880 --> 18:46.450
into the light.

18:48.160 --> 18:49.650
That all sounds lovely.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.883
That'll be all, 007. Report to Q
tomorrow for medical, thank you.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.731
Very good, sir.

19:04.600 --> 19:05.806
James?

19:05.880 --> 19:06.881
Moneypenny.

19:07.120 --> 19:09.521
So? How was the meeting?

19:09.600 --> 19:11.409
Very good,
thank you.

19:11.760 --> 19:12.807
Here.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.048
Forensics finally released this.
What is it?

19:15.120 --> 19:18.169
It's personal effects
they recovered from Skyfall.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.049
Perfect. You can
bring it to me later.

19:20.120 --> 19:22.566
What do you mean?
My place, 9:00.

19:34.920 --> 19:36.206
Evening.

19:36.320 --> 19:37.560
Come in.

19:39.520 --> 19:41.363
Have you just moved in?

19:41.440 --> 19:42.441
No.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.040
Well, I like what you've done
with the place.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.165
Your delivery.

19:49.160 --> 19:50.605
Thank you.

19:53.680 --> 19:54.806
Would you like a drink?

19:55.200 --> 19:56.440
No, thanks.
I'm not staying.

19:56.520 --> 19:57.681
That's a shame.

19:58.600 --> 20:00.329
What's going on, James?

20:01.560 --> 20:04.882
There's not one person at MI6
who isn't talking about it.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.611
Talking about what, exactly?

20:08.600 --> 20:11.410
That what you did in Mexico
was one step too far.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.169
That you're finished.

20:14.240 --> 20:15.651
And what do you think?

20:15.960 --> 20:18.122
I think you're just
getting started.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.483
I don't know what you mean.

20:21.640 --> 20:22.971
All right.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.368
I think you've got a secret.

20:27.160 --> 20:29.970
And it's something
you won't tell anyone.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.842
Because you
don't trust anyone.

20:43.640 --> 20:47.645
<i>If anything happens to me, 007,
I need you to do something.</i>

20:47.960 --> 20:51.442
<i>Find a man
called Marco Sciarra.</i>

20:52.560 --> 20:53.891
<i>Kill him.</i>

20:54.600 --> 20:56.682
<i>And don't miss the funeral.</i>

20:59.840 --> 21:01.171
Jesus.

21:02.040 --> 21:03.530
Where did you get it?

21:03.600 --> 21:06.080
In my mailbox
just after she died.

21:06.800 --> 21:08.962
Well, she was never
short of surprises.

21:10.320 --> 21:12.561
She wasn't gonna let death
get in the way of her job.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.966
I've been tracking
Sciarra ever since.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.371
And what have you found?

21:18.880 --> 21:20.803
Nothing significant yet.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.287
When's the funeral?

21:23.200 --> 21:25.567
Three days. In Rome.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.684
If you think M's signing off on that,
you're insane.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.251
He won't let you
out of his sight.

21:30.320 --> 21:32.561
Yes, it's a bit of
a problem.

21:32.760 --> 21:33.966
Listen.

21:34.400 --> 21:37.324
Could you do a little
quiet digging for me?

21:37.760 --> 21:40.411
I heard a name in Mexico.
"The Pale King."

21:42.800 --> 21:44.689
You want me
to be your mole.

21:46.440 --> 21:47.487
Yes.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.604
And what makes you think
you can trust me?

21:55.240 --> 21:56.571
Instinct.

22:57.120 --> 23:00.283
Poor old girl.
Rigged for demolition in a week.

23:01.720 --> 23:04.564
Cheaper to knock her down
than to rebuild.

23:04.960 --> 23:06.325
Still.

23:06.400 --> 23:08.880
Time waits for no man
and all that.

23:09.720 --> 23:12.644
Anyway, all the money's
been spent on this,

23:13.560 --> 23:16.245
the New Centre for
National Security.

23:18.080 --> 23:20.082
So that's C's new digs.

23:20.400 --> 23:21.925
You've met him, have you?

23:22.000 --> 23:24.128
Yesterday.
What do we know about him?

23:24.200 --> 23:26.362
Classic Whitehall mandarin.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.566
Wrote a dossier last year

23:27.640 --> 23:29.642
on how the double-0 program
was obsolete,

23:29.760 --> 23:32.764
how drones could do
all our dirty work abroad.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.605
Went to school with
the Home Secretary.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.170
Of course, he did.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.527
This merger's
just the start of it.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.921
In three days, there's
a security conference in Tokyo

23:41.000 --> 23:43.241
to decide
the New World Order.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.561
If C gets his way,
he'll have unlimited access

23:45.640 --> 23:48.371
to the combined intelligence streams
of nine countries.

23:48.440 --> 23:49.646
Including us.

23:49.720 --> 23:50.881
Quite.

24:00.200 --> 24:02.521
Well, a lot's happened
while you were away.

24:02.600 --> 24:06.685
A train bombing in Hamburg
and an industrial explosion in Tunisia.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.211
It's not great timing
for us.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.126
It's all rather
playing into C's hands.

24:11.200 --> 24:15.125
M, well, let's say
he's feeling the pressure.

24:15.560 --> 24:16.891
Yeah, I've noticed.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.769
Now, this way, 007.

24:18.840 --> 24:21.320
Be careful.
It's a trifle slippery.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.521
Q wasn't exactly feeling at home
in Whitehall,

24:26.600 --> 24:27.601
what with the new merger,

24:27.680 --> 24:31.810
so he set up shop here,
away from prying eyes, as it were.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.724
I hear he's got something rather
special planned for you.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.484
I can hardly wait.

24:47.200 --> 24:48.361
Ah, 007.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.922
- Q.
- Please excuse the mess.

24:52.280 --> 24:53.486
Everything's a little
bit up in the air,

24:53.560 --> 24:54.846
what with the changes
and all.

24:54.920 --> 24:57.241
Couple of things
to get through.

24:58.200 --> 24:59.929
Shall we get started?

25:00.560 --> 25:01.891
Just relax.

25:03.720 --> 25:04.721
That's it. Lovely.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.843
Now, you may feel a small...

25:06.920 --> 25:07.967
Christ!

25:08.400 --> 25:09.401
...prick.

25:11.600 --> 25:12.681
What is it?

25:12.760 --> 25:14.489
Cutting-edge
nanotechnology.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.205
Smart Blood.

25:17.400 --> 25:19.368
Microchips in
your bloodstream.

25:19.440 --> 25:22.523
Allows us to track
your movements in the field.

25:23.240 --> 25:24.844
You see those readouts?

25:24.960 --> 25:28.601
We can monitor your vital signs
from anywhere on the planet.

25:28.680 --> 25:30.842
Well, that sounds marvelous.

25:31.240 --> 25:34.050
Call it a post-Mexico
insurance policy.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.645
By direct order of M.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.648
I completely understand.

25:41.160 --> 25:42.286
Good.

25:44.120 --> 25:47.249
Right. Well, I've just, um,
got one last thing for you

25:47.320 --> 25:48.890
and you can be on your way.

25:55.800 --> 25:57.723
Magnificent, isn't she?

25:58.160 --> 26:00.401
Zero to 60 in
three point two seconds.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.848
Fully bulletproof.
A few little tricks up her sleeve.

26:04.840 --> 26:06.604
It's a shame, really.
She was meant for you,

26:06.680 --> 26:09.604
but she's been
reassigned to 009.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.809
But you can have this.

26:18.320 --> 26:19.924
Does it do anything?

26:20.000 --> 26:21.684
It tells the time.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.083
Might help with your
punctuality issues.

26:24.160 --> 26:26.049
M's idea?
Precisely.

26:27.320 --> 26:31.166
Oh, one word of warning.
The alarm is rather loud.

26:32.160 --> 26:33.764
If you know what I mean.

26:33.840 --> 26:35.365
I think I do.

26:41.400 --> 26:44.529
Oh, yes. That old thing
is taking quite a bit of time.

26:44.880 --> 26:47.360
Mind you, there wasn't
much left to work on.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.329
Only a steering wheel.

26:49.400 --> 26:53.689
I believe I said, "Bring it back in one piece,"
not, "Bring back one piece."

26:58.600 --> 27:01.649
Anyway, enjoy
your downtime, 007.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.644
- Q?
- Yes?

27:06.440 --> 27:10.240
Well, now you know exactly
where I am all of the time.

27:11.440 --> 27:13.204
Will you do
something for me?

27:13.280 --> 27:15.726
What do you have
in mind, exactly?

27:16.680 --> 27:18.045
Make me disappear.

27:21.320 --> 27:24.642
May I remind you that
I answer directly to M.

27:24.960 --> 27:27.804
I also have a mortgage.
And two cats to feed.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.565
Well, then I suggest
you trust me,

27:31.160 --> 27:32.924
for the sake of the cats.

27:37.640 --> 27:40.484
Well, it's lovely to
see you, 007. Lovely.

27:40.800 --> 27:42.006
Um, now,
I meant to tell you,

27:42.080 --> 27:45.926
the Smart Blood program is obviously
still in its developmental phase.

27:46.000 --> 27:51.086
So we may experience the odd drop
in coverage during the first 24 hours...

27:53.240 --> 27:56.528
48 hours after
administration,

27:56.600 --> 27:59.285
but after that it
should work perfectly.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.484
I'll send you a postcard.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.525
Please, don't.

28:32.600 --> 28:33.681
Morning.

28:33.760 --> 28:36.411
What's that?
Oh, it's just something from an admirer.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.960
It's not your birthday,
is it?

28:38.000 --> 28:39.650
No, sir.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.569
That was last week.

28:42.960 --> 28:43.961
Morning.

28:44.040 --> 28:47.886
009 has arrived to pick up the DB10, sir.
He's waiting upstairs.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.803
Oh, good.
Yes, fine.

29:04.880 --> 29:06.564
Oh, shit.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.402
I'm sorry
for your loss.

31:15.120 --> 31:16.406
You knew my husband?

31:16.520 --> 31:18.010
All too briefly.

31:18.840 --> 31:20.046
What do you do?

31:20.520 --> 31:22.045
Life insurance.

31:22.800 --> 31:24.564
A little late for that.

31:24.640 --> 31:26.529
For your husband, yes.

31:27.160 --> 31:28.969
But what about you?

31:29.760 --> 31:30.966
Me?

31:31.040 --> 31:35.329
I hear the life expectancy
of some widows can be very short.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.641
How can you
talk like this?

31:39.240 --> 31:41.163
Can't you see
I'm grieving?

31:41.800 --> 31:43.040
No.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.884
What a lovely view.

34:06.160 --> 34:08.322
You're wasting your time.

34:08.440 --> 34:11.409
There are 100 more
that will come after me.

34:12.040 --> 34:14.804
All you buy me
is five minutes.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.245
Excellent.

34:17.719 --> 34:19.370
Time for a drink.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.969
You killed him,

34:31.639 --> 34:33.085
didn't you?

34:33.159 --> 34:34.446
My husband.

34:34.840 --> 34:36.763
He was an assassin.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.047
Trust me, he won't
take it personally.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.880
You signed my death warrant.
I was respected.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.411
Loyal to a man you hated.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.204
He trusted my silence.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.567
With him gone,
I'm a dead woman.

34:51.639 --> 34:52.766
I can trust nobody.

34:52.840 --> 34:53.841
I know the feeling well.

34:53.920 --> 34:56.491
Well, I can tell you
that I don't trust you.

34:56.560 --> 34:58.688
Well, then you have
impeccable instincts.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.331
If you don't leave now,
we'll die together.

35:03.920 --> 35:06.287
I can think of
worse ways to go.

35:07.680 --> 35:11.446
Then you're
obviously crazy, Mister...

35:13.360 --> 35:14.566
Bond.

35:15.600 --> 35:18.080
James Bond.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.210
These people,

35:30.760 --> 35:33.366
if you just knew
what they could do.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.562
The power they have.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.243
Did your husband ever mention
"The Pale King?"

35:41.320 --> 35:42.401
No.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.163
The organization,

35:47.680 --> 35:49.569
they hardly ever meet.

35:52.080 --> 35:55.243
But because of what happened
to my husband,

35:55.840 --> 35:57.205
they meet tonight.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.441
Why?

35:59.080 --> 36:01.208
To choose a replacement.

36:01.920 --> 36:03.081
Where?

36:04.560 --> 36:06.767
The Palazzo Cardenza.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.924
Midnight.
Sounds like fun.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.843
I might drop by.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.327
He was obsessed.

36:14.440 --> 36:17.887
He spent more time
with them than with me.

36:20.600 --> 36:22.682
Then the man was a fool.

36:34.280 --> 36:35.770
Leaving your number?

36:35.880 --> 36:38.929
I've called
an American friend of mine. Felix.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.646
He'll contact his embassy
and get you out of here.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.285
You'll be safe.

36:51.200 --> 36:52.770
Don't go, James.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.484
If you go there,

36:55.560 --> 36:58.450
you're crossing over to a place
where there is no mercy.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.046
I have to go.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.641
Identify yourself, asshole.

37:58.320 --> 37:59.320
Who are you?

37:59.520 --> 38:02.330
I'm Mickey Mouse. Who are <i>you?</i>

38:20.560 --> 38:22.005
...pharmacy sites
has provided

38:22.080 --> 38:24.321
an excellent
new sales platform.

38:24.560 --> 38:28.804
We have adapted many of them
into clearinghouses for unapproved drugs.

38:29.280 --> 38:30.805
In addition to which,

38:30.880 --> 38:33.486
the latest figures show
that we presently control

38:33.560 --> 38:35.881
70% of
antimalarial vaccines,

38:36.680 --> 38:41.686
34% of H.I.V.,
and 40% of all oncological drugs

38:42.360 --> 38:44.169
across Sub-Saharan Africa.

38:44.360 --> 38:47.921
But we face challenges
from the WHO

38:48.000 --> 38:51.766
in their campaign against
our counterfeit pharmaceuticals.

38:52.200 --> 38:55.727
We have now identified
the key individuals to target.

38:56.240 --> 38:58.163
We expect the same
success as we had

38:58.240 --> 39:00.561
against the Council
on Human Trafficking.

39:02.720 --> 39:04.961
Since the board's resignation...

39:05.040 --> 39:10.080
...we have placed 160,000 migrated females
into the leisure sector.

39:10.400 --> 39:13.847
The impending completion of
the Global Surveillance initiative...

39:13.920 --> 39:18.448
...will mean our capability
is second to none...

39:18.520 --> 39:23.242
...and now is the moment
for aggressive expansion.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.284
The news is only good...

39:59.200 --> 40:01.248
Don't let me
interrupt you.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.082
The news is only good...

40:14.920 --> 40:17.890
Our increased surveillance capability...

40:17.960 --> 40:20.691
...means government intelligence agencies...

40:20.760 --> 40:22.762
...are easily counteracted.

40:22.840 --> 40:25.446
We are winning.

40:26.000 --> 40:27.331
Thank you, Doctor.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.246
Now, on to
the matter at hand.

40:30.640 --> 40:34.406
After the success of our attacks
in Hamburg and Tunisia,

40:34.480 --> 40:36.881
the aborted attack
in Mexico City

40:36.960 --> 40:40.885
and the death of our valued colleague,
Marco Sciarra,

40:41.000 --> 40:44.049
leaves one of his duties
outstanding.

40:44.440 --> 40:47.569
<i>Signor</i> Guerra,
The Pale King must be terminated.

40:48.240 --> 40:50.971
Will you make
the journey to Altaussee?

40:54.800 --> 40:56.962
Of course.

40:57.040 --> 40:58.804
My loyalty to this organization is total.

40:58.880 --> 41:02.123
I will protect it with my last breath.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.806
There will be no more...

41:04.880 --> 41:07.486
...amateurs.

41:07.560 --> 41:11.167
No more shows of weakness.

41:45.680 --> 41:49.765
Does anyone challenge
<i>Signor</i> Guerra for this position?

42:15.080 --> 42:16.161
Welcome.

42:16.240 --> 42:19.005
State your credentials
for succeeding <i>Signor</i> Sciarra.

43:13.000 --> 43:14.365
It's funny.

43:17.320 --> 43:21.006
All that excitement
in Mexico City rang a distant bell.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.405
And now,

43:25.960 --> 43:29.203
suddenly, this evening,
it makes perfect sense.

43:34.680 --> 43:36.523
Welcome, James.

43:40.160 --> 43:42.083
It's been a long time.

43:43.360 --> 43:45.727
But, finally, here we are.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.763
What took you so long?

43:59.640 --> 44:01.244
Cuckoo.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.849
Ciao, Mickey Mouse.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.282
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me.

45:44.440 --> 45:45.521
No.

46:53.680 --> 46:55.250
Moneypenny.

46:59.240 --> 47:00.241
Bond?

47:00.320 --> 47:02.084
Listen, Moneypenny.
Hamburg, Tunisia,

47:02.160 --> 47:03.844
Mexico City,
they're all linked.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.605
It's one organization
coordinating multiple attacks.

47:06.680 --> 47:08.011
So, she was right.

47:08.080 --> 47:09.241
<i>Of course, she was.</i>

47:09.320 --> 47:11.322
- I ran that check.
- Who is it?

47:12.600 --> 47:15.843
Oh, my boss had his
credit card stolen.

47:15.920 --> 47:18.161
It's nothing.
Why don't you go back to sleep.

47:18.240 --> 47:19.241
Don't be long.

47:19.320 --> 47:20.924
- Who was that?
<i>- No one.</i>

47:21.160 --> 47:22.400
<i>No, it wasn't.</i>

47:22.480 --> 47:23.686
It's just a friend.

47:23.760 --> 47:24.886
At this time of night?

47:24.960 --> 47:28.089
It's called life, James.
You should try it sometime.

47:34.880 --> 47:38.043
<i>The Pale King. It looks like
you've had dealings with him before.</i>

47:38.120 --> 47:39.451
<i>Quantum.</i>
Of course.

47:39.520 --> 47:41.522
Mr. White!
<i>That's him.</i>

47:42.160 --> 47:46.848
Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria, four months ago.

47:47.560 --> 47:48.607
Hold that thought.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.448
You still there?
Yeah.

48:03.520 --> 48:04.885
Run another name, will you?

48:04.960 --> 48:06.803
Okay. Go.

48:07.120 --> 48:09.805
A man called
Franz Oberhauser. He's...

48:12.800 --> 48:15.406
And check his files
before and after his death.

48:15.480 --> 48:17.244
After his death?
What are you talking about?

48:17.320 --> 48:19.243
Please, just do it.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.441
Okay, Q, give me something.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.164
That's more like it.

50:06.320 --> 50:07.481
Here goes nothing.

50:44.080 --> 50:45.570
Good evening.

51:02.800 --> 51:06.088
<i>Do not let them tell you
we need less surveillance.</i>

51:06.480 --> 51:09.006
<i>We need more. Much more.</i>

51:10.080 --> 51:13.971
<i>I say again, the Nine Eyes committee
would have full access</i>

51:14.040 --> 51:17.249
<i>to the combined intelligence streams
of all member states.</i>

51:17.320 --> 51:19.482
<i>More data, more analysis,</i>

51:19.920 --> 51:22.730
<i>less likelihood of
a terrorist attack.</i>

51:23.960 --> 51:25.086
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

51:25.160 --> 51:27.811
<i>it's time for the security services
of the world to unite.</i>

51:29.720 --> 51:31.324
<i>Alone, we are weak.</i>

51:32.400 --> 51:35.244
<i>Together,
we're a global power.</i>

51:35.680 --> 51:37.170
An unelected one.

51:38.640 --> 51:39.971
<i>Thank you.</i>

51:41.200 --> 51:42.361
Thank you.

51:43.160 --> 51:45.128
We will now vote
on the resolution.

51:45.600 --> 51:48.524
Ladies and gentlemen,
please cast your vote.

51:53.880 --> 51:55.882
The vote is eight
to one in favor.

51:56.280 --> 51:58.009
However, as you know,

51:58.080 --> 52:01.050
we cannot proceed
unless by unanimous vote.

52:01.520 --> 52:04.285
The Nine Eyes motion
is therefore not passed.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.361
Democracy.

52:06.440 --> 52:07.407
Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.800
This evening's session is adjourned.

52:25.320 --> 52:26.321
Yes, sir.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.721
Please, tell me 007
is in London.

52:28.800 --> 52:29.881
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

52:30.120 --> 52:32.771
Um, I'll just take
a look now, sir.

52:32.840 --> 52:34.729
Because if he isn't,
you're in deep shit.

52:36.520 --> 52:38.249
<i>You've got precisely
10 seconds.</i>

52:42.480 --> 52:45.165
I have him, sir.
He appears to be in Chelsea.

52:45.240 --> 52:48.608
Well, I want eyes on him
when I get back, understood?

52:49.040 --> 52:51.008
I completely understand,

52:52.160 --> 52:53.241
sir.

55:46.040 --> 55:48.486
Do me a favor.
Make it quick.

55:48.920 --> 55:50.684
Upstairs, Mr. White.

56:01.120 --> 56:04.886
I always knew death would wear
a familiar face,

56:04.960 --> 56:06.450
but not yours.

56:06.520 --> 56:09.444
To what do I owe
this pleasure, Mr. Bond?

56:11.840 --> 56:14.127
I was at a meeting recently

56:14.200 --> 56:16.089
and your name came up.

56:16.200 --> 56:19.170
I'm flattered London is still
talking about me.

56:19.240 --> 56:20.730
It wasn't MI6.

56:21.800 --> 56:23.086
It was Rome.

56:24.280 --> 56:26.248
Your team, not mine.

56:26.640 --> 56:27.641
Ah.

56:32.320 --> 56:36.644
Last month,
I found thallium in my cell phone.

56:37.160 --> 56:41.290
It's done its job.
I have a few weeks. Maybe less.

56:43.680 --> 56:46.684
So, here we are, Mr. Bond,

56:47.120 --> 56:49.851
two dead men
enjoying the evening.

56:50.560 --> 56:52.085
What did you do?

56:52.160 --> 56:53.810
I disobeyed him.

56:54.120 --> 56:57.647
I followed him
as far as I could.

56:58.320 --> 56:59.606
He changed.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.246
Oh, I see.

57:02.000 --> 57:03.604
You grew a conscience.

57:04.120 --> 57:07.090
Our game is our game.
But this?

57:08.080 --> 57:10.321
Women, children...

57:10.920 --> 57:12.251
Well, the thallium
would suggest

57:12.320 --> 57:14.368
that he doesn't like you
very much anymore.

57:14.440 --> 57:16.329
And clearly
the feeling is mutual.

57:16.400 --> 57:18.607
So why don't you tell me
how to find him again?

57:18.680 --> 57:19.681
Oh, come on.

57:20.760 --> 57:22.250
Tell me where he is.

57:22.320 --> 57:24.049
He's everywhere.

57:24.360 --> 57:25.407
Everywhere!

57:25.760 --> 57:27.649
He's sitting
at your desk,

57:27.720 --> 57:30.963
he's kissing your lover,
he's eating supper with your family!

57:38.360 --> 57:40.442
You're protecting someone.

57:41.560 --> 57:42.561
Your wife.

57:46.040 --> 57:47.883
She left long ago.

57:48.600 --> 57:49.931
Your son?

57:54.000 --> 57:55.729
Your daughter.

57:58.120 --> 57:59.645
You won't find her.

57:59.720 --> 58:01.210
She's clever.

58:01.280 --> 58:04.409
She's smarter than me.
She knows how to hide.

58:06.000 --> 58:08.480
I can protect her if
you tell me where he is.

58:11.160 --> 58:12.844
I can keep her alive.

58:12.920 --> 58:14.081
Yeah.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.240
You have my word.

58:18.320 --> 58:19.526
Your word?

58:20.520 --> 58:22.409
The word of an assassin!

58:34.800 --> 58:36.450
That's my word.

59:04.320 --> 59:05.845
<i>L'Américain.</i>

59:06.880 --> 59:08.689
You save her,

59:08.760 --> 59:11.445
she can lead you to <i>L'Américain.</i>
She knows <i>L'Américain.</i>

59:12.640 --> 59:14.722
Try the Hoffler Klinik.

59:21.520 --> 59:25.969
You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,
Mr. Bond.

59:29.160 --> 59:30.321
So long.

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:26.849
I can't deny I'm impressed
you got H.M.G. to cough up for all this.

01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:29.400
Good God, the government couldn't
afford this kind of facility.

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:32.171
No, it was benefactors mostly,
from the private sector.

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:33.767
When it goes online,

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:35.649
this building will be
the most sophisticated

01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.688
data gathering system
in history.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:40.764
The world's digital ghost,
available 24/7.

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:42.490
George Orwell's
worst nightmare.

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:43.721
I'm glad you like it.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.084
My commiserations
on losing the Nine Eyes vote.

01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:48.241
Must have been a blow.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.482
Not really.
Only a matter of time

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.800
before the South Africans
see the light.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:54.121
And you know what they say,
Rome wasn't built in a day.

01:00:54.200 --> 01:00:55.201
Day and a half maybe.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.403
Look, Max, I know
surveillance is a fact of life.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:03.610
It's how you use the information
that concerns me,

01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.165
and who is using it.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.368
This is what we need to do
to keep the people safe.

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.766
Double-0 program
is prehistoric.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.846
Come on, M. You can't really
tell me that one man in the field

01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:15.649
can compete with all of this,

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:18.451
running around out there
with his license to kill.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.682
Have you ever had
to kill a man, Max?

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.526
Have you?

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.287
To pull that trigger,
you have to be sure.

01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.366
Yes, you investigate,
analyze, assess, target.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.568
And then you have
to look him in the eye.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.650
And you make the call.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.283
And all the drones, bugs,
cameras, transcripts,

01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.362
all the surveillance
in the world

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:45.841
can't tell you
what to do next.

01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.529
A license to kill

01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:53.123
is also a license
not to kill.

01:01:55.040 --> 01:01:57.486
I didn't want to
have to do this,

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.570
but it looks like you still can't
control your agents.

01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.928
<i>Bond? I ran that check.</i>

01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:09.251
<i>Looks like you've had
dealings with him before. Quantum.</i>

01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:11.129
<i>Of course. Mr. White!</i>

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.643
<i>Last unconfirmed sighting,
Altaussee in Austria.</i>

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.210
<i>Run another name,
will you?</i>

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.561
So maybe there's
something to be said

01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.608
for total surveillance
after all.

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.888
You watch MI6 agents?

01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:29.084
We watch everyone.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.731
Please, take a seat.

01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.848
I'll be with you
in just a moment.

01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:57.287
Please excuse me,
Mr. Bond.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:02.080
My name is
Dr. Madeleine Swann.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.003
Our job today is to
analyze your needs,

01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:06.606
both psychological
and physical.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.410
Hmm, sounds pretty
straightforward.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.001
I hope you don't mind.
The view can be distracting.

01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:13.764
I hadn't noticed.

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.846
I see you filled out
most of the paperwork.

01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:27.126
Just a few questions to
complete your evaluation, if I may.

01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.290
Do you exercise?

01:04:29.640 --> 01:04:30.880
When I have to.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:34.643
Do you consider your employment to be
psychologically stressful?

01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.721
Sometimes.

01:04:37.280 --> 01:04:38.770
How much alcohol
do you consume?

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:40.926
Too much.

01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.410
Some broader questions.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.720
As a child, would you say
you were close to your parents?

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.486
My parents died
when I was young.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:52.964
Really? How old?

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:54.965
Old enough to remember.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:56.725
How, if I may ask?

01:04:56.800 --> 01:04:58.245
It was a climbing accident.

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.161
So who brought you up?

01:05:00.240 --> 01:05:01.730
Someone else.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:03.720
Humor me.

01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:08.446
How does one train at Oxford
and the Sorbonne become a consultant,

01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:11.569
spend two years with
<i>Médecins Sans Frontières</i>

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.244
and end up here?

01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.767
Forgive me,
but anyone might think

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.490
you were hiding
from something.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.761
You're paying a lot of money
to be here, Mr. Bond.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:25.241
Who's asking the questions,
you or me?

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.368
Of course. Carry on.

01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.730
I see you left this
final question blank.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.845
What is your occupation?

01:05:35.920 --> 01:05:39.720
Well, that's not the sort of thing
that looks good on a form.

01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.046
And why is that?

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.121
I kill people.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:46.486
Small world?

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.201
Where is he?

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.204
Your father's dead.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:53.965
Two days ago.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.565
How do you know?

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.205
Because I was there.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:58.881
Did you kill him?

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.007
I didn't have to.

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.370
He did it himself.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.204
And you came all the way
just to tell me this?

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.251
That my father's dead?

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:12.361
I came to tell you that your life is in
danger and I need your help.

01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:16.241
Why? I made a deal
with him to protect you.

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.845
You're lying.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.731
Why would he trust you?

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:23.849
Because he knew that
I needed something in return.

01:06:24.240 --> 01:06:25.480
And what was that?

01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:27.651
To find <i>L'Américain.</i>

01:06:29.080 --> 01:06:30.320
This interview is over.

01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.640
Dr. Swann...

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:35.964
You have 10 minutes to leave the building.
Then I'm calling security.

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:41.369
Thank you,
Dr. Swann.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:05.165
Can I get you
something, sir?

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:07.686
Vodka martini.
Shaken, not stirred.

01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.366
I'm sorry,
we don't serve alcohol.

01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:13.048
I'm really starting
to love this place.

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.487
He'll have the prolytic
digestive enzyme shake.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:16.847
Certainly.

01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.525
If you've come
for the car,

01:07:18.600 --> 01:07:20.204
I parked it
at the bottom of the Tiber.

01:07:20.280 --> 01:07:23.284
Well, not to worry, 007.
It was only a £3,000,000 prototype.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:24.726
Why are you here, Q?

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.723
Oh, I just fancied a break,
to be honest.

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.643
I've been a tad stressed
at work recently.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.883
What with C's people
crawling all over us

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.883
and the fact that M wants my balls
for Christmas decorations.

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:35.122
Get to the point.
The point, 007,

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.328
is that Franz Oberhauser
is dead.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.890
Dead and buried.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.291
And unless you come back
with me right now,

01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:43.284
my career and Moneypenny's
will go the same way.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.250
Do you understand?
All hell is breaking loose out there and...

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:49.011
I saw him.
You thought you saw him.

01:07:49.080 --> 01:07:50.650
We've been through
the records.

01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.371
He died in an avalanche
with his father 20 years ago.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:55.408
Yes. I know that.

01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:56.925
But I saw him.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.968
He's not someone
I'll ever forget.

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:04.602
So you have a lead?

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:06.444
I have a name.
<i>L'Américain.</i>

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.370
Well,
that narrows it down.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.767
Look, I'm sorry, 007,
but time's up.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.888
My whole career
is on the line here.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:16.406
Either you come back in
and do this through proper channels,

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:17.606
or I go directly to M.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.365
Do one more thing for me.
Then you're out.

01:08:21.399 --> 01:08:23.720
Find out what you can
from this.

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.685
I really, really
hate you right now.

01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:35.569
Thank you, Q.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:38.848
<i>Monsieur?</i>
Now? Please?

01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:39.966
Where are you staying?

01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.121
The Pevsner. Room 12.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.439
One hour.

01:08:43.840 --> 01:08:47.322
Here you are, sir.
One prolytic digestive enzyme shake.

01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.930
Do me a favor,
will you?

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.127
Throw that
down the toilet.

01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.645
Cut out the middleman.

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.444
No! Stay.

01:09:54.240 --> 01:09:55.844
What do you want?

01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.360
What are you doing?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.650
Can't any of you speak?

01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.645
Come on!

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.604
Argh, don't touch me!

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:34.441
Hey!

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.849
You need to take a breath and calm down.
You're in shock.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:40.730
Get away from me!
Just get away!

01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:43.241
Did it cross your mind
that you led them to me?

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.966
I haven't got
time for this.

01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:53.923
You need to tell me everything
you know about <i>L'Américain.</i>

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:55.451
Go to hell!

01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.244
I gave your father my word!

01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.922
And why should I trust you?
Because my father did?

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:08.927
Because right now,
Dr. Swann,

01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:13.246
I'm your best chance
of staying alive.

01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:38.204
Dr. Swann, Q.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.328
Q, Dr. Swann.

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:42.963
Hello.
Enchanted.

01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:47.690
Bond, we need
to talk. Alone.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.886
She knows.

01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.928
But, Bond...
She knows.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.886
What have you got?

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.802
I owe you an apology, 007.

01:15:56.520 --> 01:15:58.522
You are onto something.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.841
Oberhauser is still alive.
The ring proves it.

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.647
And it seems they were
all part of one organization.

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.326
Le Chiffre, Quantum, Sciarra,
your friend Mr. Silva.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.369
And do you know
who links them all?

01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.646
Him.

01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:14.251
Exactly.

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.767
This organization,
do you know what it's called?

01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:19.326
- No.
- Spectre.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:24.247
Its name is Spectre.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:25.681
How does she know that?

01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:28.001
Because my father
was part of it.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.928
Then I think that
you ought to see this.

01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:33.726
<i>You're looking
at pictures from South Africa right now</i>

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.768
<i>of what appears to be
a huge explosion.</i>

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:38.411
Q, go back to London.

01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.724
M's gonna need your help.
And keep tracking me.

01:16:42.800 --> 01:16:44.006
I will.

01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:46.647
And, Bond, you have
to find <i>L'Américain.</i>

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.728
He's our only link
to Oberhauser.

01:16:49.800 --> 01:16:51.131
It's not a person.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:53.965
It's a place.

01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.605
Thank you.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:34.488
This is where they spent
their wedding night.

01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.282
They came back every year.

01:18:39.200 --> 01:18:41.089
Then they brought me
with them, too.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.490
He kept coming back,
even after the divorce.

01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:51.649
Well, then I'm sorry.

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:53.687
What for?

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.161
Ah-ha!

01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:11.171
What is it?

01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:14.929
It's your inheritance.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:17.767
Want some?
No, thank you.

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:22.000
You don't know
what you're missing.

01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:32.484
This can't be it.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:35.808
Well, here's to your father.

01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:41.688
I promised myself I would never
be hurt by that man again.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.209
I cut off all contact.

01:19:46.040 --> 01:19:49.522
I didn't want anything to do
with him or his sick life.

01:19:50.720 --> 01:19:53.041
And then,
with his dying breath

01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:55.324
he sends me you.

01:19:56.680 --> 01:19:58.170
Ironic, no?

01:19:58.240 --> 01:20:00.607
You shouldn't be
so hard on him.

01:20:00.880 --> 01:20:04.089
The man I just met should
have been dead weeks ago.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.925
The only reason his heart
was still beating was you.

01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:10.891
I'll mourn my father
in my own time, Mr. Bond.

01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:14.447
And, now,
I'm going to bed.

01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:18.641
Oh.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.130
Don't think for one moment
this is where I fall into your arms,

01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.970
seeking solace
for my dead daddy.

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.605
You sit there.

01:20:36.240 --> 01:20:39.084
Keep watch.
That's what you're good at.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.804
Come anywhere near me
and I'll kill you.

01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:48.530
I don't doubt it.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:02.204
Look. There are two of you.

01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:05.210
Two Jameses.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:08.250
Lucky me.

01:21:13.400 --> 01:21:15.641
What am I doing here?

01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:26.211
To liars...

01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:28.248
...and killers.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.522
To liars...

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:32.602
...and killers...

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.682
...everywhere.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:08.483
Who sent you?

01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:13.609
Who are you working for?

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.288
Now, where did you go?

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.769
Of course.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:48.325
What is it?

01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.491
Nothing.

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:08.246
What's this?

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:10.530
It's coordinates.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.371
Your father was scanning for
a particular satellite phone.

01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:18.522
He was looking
for someone.

01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:22.163
He was looking for him.

01:25:23.800 --> 01:25:26.371
And he sent me here
to finish the job.

01:25:28.360 --> 01:25:30.283
I'm coming with you.
No, you're not.

01:25:31.360 --> 01:25:32.691
I like you alive.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.250
I can look after myself.

01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:36.049
That's beside the point.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:39.164
I might not be coming back.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.806
I know.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:45.048
But I want to understand
what happened to my father.

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:05.402
So, where was he going?

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.331
Nowhere.

01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:25.485
Thank you so much. Thanks.
All the very best.

01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:26.560
What's going on?

01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:28.523
The meeting was brought forward.
Did you not get the message?

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.681
No, we didn't.

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.000
Shortest meeting
I can remember.

01:26:31.240 --> 01:26:32.685
South Africans on board,
I take it?

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.603
Yeah, well,
who can blame them?

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.248
Nine Eyes is now
officially sanctioned.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.891
The new system goes live
in less than 72 hours.

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.928
It's a major step forward.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:43.843
Global intelligence cooperation
changes everything.

01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.604
As you said before.

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.566
Look.

01:26:49.400 --> 01:26:51.562
They've asked me
to head the new committee.

01:26:51.640 --> 01:26:53.529
Yes? And?

01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:57.207
And I should tell you
I've spoken with the Home Secretary.

01:26:57.360 --> 01:27:00.045
And in light of the new information
I've given him,

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:03.169
he's decided to close down
the double-0 program with immediate effect.

01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.801
You don't know
what you're doing.

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.803
It's not personal.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.484
It's the future.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.166
And...

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:13.640
You're not.

01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.489
You're a cocky little bastard,
aren't you?

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:19.450
I'll take that
as a compliment.

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:21.051
I wouldn't.

01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:23.809
This isn't over yet.

01:27:41.800 --> 01:27:45.043
Would you press this for me? Thank you.
Yes, sir.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.565
Pick it up.

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.205
I hate guns.

01:28:08.720 --> 01:28:11.007
I promised him
I'd protect you.

01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:13.811
The first thing to do is to teach
you how to protect yourself.

01:28:14.200 --> 01:28:16.202
What if I shoot you
by mistake?

01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:18.688
Wouldn't be the first time.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.280
Pick it up.

01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:22.283
I said, I hate guns.

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:29.644
SIG 226.

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:32.571
Front sight.
Rear sight. Hammer.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.601
You just point it.
You squeeze the trigger.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:42.921
You try not to
close your eyes.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:46.245
Please, try it.

01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:14.091
I don't have to
teach you anything, do I?

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:19.203
A man once came to our house
to kill my father.

01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.049
He didn't know I was upstairs
playing in my bedroom.

01:29:23.120 --> 01:29:25.407
Or that Papa kept
a Beretta Nine-millimeter

01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.642
under the sink
with the bleach.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.883
That's why I hate guns.

01:29:34.240 --> 01:29:36.846
I think we'll skip
hand-to-hand combat.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:55.881
Good evening, sir.

01:29:55.960 --> 01:29:58.088
Sorry to interrupt your supper,
but we have some news.

01:29:58.160 --> 01:29:59.605
Evening, sir.

01:29:59.680 --> 01:30:02.160
Using the Smart Blood,
I've tracked Bond

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:04.766
to a point here
in North Africa.

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.691
See, every known map
registers it as empty desert.

01:30:08.760 --> 01:30:12.606
Exactly. But if you look at the satellite blowup,
you can clearly see this.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:14.291
We can't help him.

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.125
But, sir, we know
where he's heading.

01:30:19.120 --> 01:30:21.009
C is watching
everything we do.

01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:23.686
We're only handing them
more information.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:29.287
Sir, we can't
just desert Bond.

01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:31.448
We have to.
We only make him weaker.

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.090
But, sir,
we know exactly where he is.

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:35.811
Yes, I know, but if we can track him,
so can others.

01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.927
Delete all
the Smart Blood files.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.161
Everything.

01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.684
He's on his own.

01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.371
You shouldn't stare.

01:31:11.440 --> 01:31:13.363
Well, you shouldn't
look like that.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.324
May I get you
an <i>apéritif?</i>

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.686
I'm not sure.

01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:23.843
It gets me into trouble.
Makes me do crazy things.

01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.490
Well, we can't
have that.

01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:29.367
So, I'll have
a vodka martini, dirty.

01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:31.205
Make that two.

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:36.210
I have a question.

01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:37.760
Well, what's that?

01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:40.730
Why, given every
other possible option,

01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.560
does a man choose the life
of a paid assassin?

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.608
Well, it was that
or the priesthood.

01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:50.923
I'm serious.
Is this really what you want?

01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:54.846
Living in the shadows?
Hunting? Being hunted?

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.570
Always looking behind you?
Always alone?

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:00.206
But I'm not alone.

01:32:00.960 --> 01:32:02.644
Answer the question.

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.240
I'm not sure I ever
had a choice.

01:32:07.600 --> 01:32:09.682
Anyway, I don't stop
to think about it.

01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.923
What would happen
if you did?

01:32:12.720 --> 01:32:15.166
Stop?
Yes.

01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:20.571
I don't know.

01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:22.890
Your drinks, sir.

01:32:22.960 --> 01:32:25.440
Could you leave
them there, please.

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:39.081
You know,
I think you're wrong.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.525
I am?

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.768
We always have a choice.

01:32:46.480 --> 01:32:48.209
I'll drink to that.

01:35:36.280 --> 01:35:37.281
Shit.

01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:47.364
What do we do now?

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:48.564
This might be
a long wait.

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.367
Are you having
second thoughts?

01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:55.410
Too late now.

01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:16.405
What's that?

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:36.448
That is a 1948
Rolls-Royce Silver Wraith.

01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:01.767
Please.

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:26.609
I'm scared, James.

01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:13.125
Good afternoon,
Mr. Bond, Dr. Swann.

01:39:13.400 --> 01:39:17.200
I want you to know just how excited
we all are to finally meet you.

01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:20.045
Well, it's a pleasure
to be here.

01:39:20.280 --> 01:39:22.760
Your host invites
you both to rest,

01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:25.241
relax, and join him
for drinks at 4:00.

01:39:25.640 --> 01:39:27.881
- Tell our host we won't be late.
- Wonderful.

01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:30.965
Before we show you to your rooms,
just one more thing.

01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:39.881
Oh.

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:44.324
You be careful
with that.

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.690
It's loaded.

01:39:53.240 --> 01:39:54.571
Thank you.

01:40:53.760 --> 01:40:55.967
This is
a very special place.

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:59.802
He has requested
you enter it alone.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.651
Of course.

01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:05.491
Champagne?

01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.245
Maybe later.

01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:10.285
Certainly.

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:44.251
I think
we're meant to be impressed.

01:41:57.160 --> 01:41:58.400
Touch it.

01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:02.287
You can touch it
if you want.

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:06.289
Do you know what it is?

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.044
It's a meteorite.

01:42:09.160 --> 01:42:10.889
Yes, exactly.

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:15.160
The Kartenhoff.
The oldest in human possession.

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:19.164
The very meteorite
which made this crater.

01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:22.240
Think about it.

01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:26.521
So many years up there,
alone, silent,

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:31.605
building momentum until it chose
to make its mark on Earth.

01:42:33.400 --> 01:42:36.131
A huge, unstoppable force.

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:39.047
Except it did stop,
didn't it?

01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:40.931
Right here.

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:59.206
I can't tell you how much I've been
looking forward to this.

01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:01.601
All of us here, together.

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.925
A reunion.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.924
I'm so glad you came,
too, dear Madeleine.

01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:15.564
You were just a girl
when I saw you first.

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:19.930
I came to your home once
to see your father.

01:43:22.440 --> 01:43:24.124
I don't remember that.

01:43:25.400 --> 01:43:26.811
But I do.

01:43:31.440 --> 01:43:32.680
Shall we?

01:43:36.640 --> 01:43:37.880
What is this place?

01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:40.051
Information.

01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:45.049
Information is all,

01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:47.691
is it not?

01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:50.365
For example,

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:55.048
you must know by now that
the double-0 program is officially dead.

01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:59.484
Which leads me to
speculate exactly why you came.

01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:05.650
So, James,
why did you come?

01:44:06.160 --> 01:44:07.844
I came here to kill you.

01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:11.161
And I thought you
came here to die.

01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.528
Well, it's all
a matter of perspective.

01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:17.049
Speaking of perspective.

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:38.208
- Is this live?
- Live and direct. 16:20 GMT.

01:44:39.480 --> 01:44:41.721
What
an uncanny coincidence.

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:46.283
<i>The French have a saying,
"It's the fate of glass to break."</i>

01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:50.445
<i>Well, maybe it's the fate of spies
to just disappear.</i>

01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:52.364
<i>But with any luck,</i>

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:54.768
<i>we leave something behind.</i>

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:58.527
<i>In the meantime,
I'm sure C will keep you all busy.</i>

01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:00.890
<i>Thank you all.</i>

01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:07.524
That's touching,
don't you think?

01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:12.364
Well, James,

01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:15.327
it looks like
you're all alone.

01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:18.051
Not much more than a voyeur,
are you?

01:45:19.080 --> 01:45:21.082
Too scared to join in.

01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.004
I don't think you quite understand.

01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.491
Oh, I think I do.

01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:27.325
You set cities on fire and watch
innocent people burn,

01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.607
so you can convince
governments to join

01:45:29.680 --> 01:45:32.331
an intelligence network
you've paid for.

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.243
Not that complicated.

01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:38.760
I'm guessing our little friend, C,
he's one of your disciples.

01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.929
You could say that.

01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:43.724
And what does
he get out of it?

01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:45.926
Nothing.

01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:48.369
He's a visionary,
like me.

01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:50.090
Visionaries.

01:45:50.880 --> 01:45:52.769
Psychiatric wards
are full of them.

01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:55.804
Whereas you couldn't see
what's right in front of you.

01:45:55.880 --> 01:45:59.885
You came across me so many times
and yet you never saw me.

01:46:00.440 --> 01:46:02.841
Le Chiffre, Greene, Silva.

01:46:02.960 --> 01:46:04.086
All dead.

01:46:04.160 --> 01:46:05.286
Yeah, that's right.

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.050
A nice pattern developed.

01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:10.567
You interfered in my world,
I destroyed yours.

01:46:12.440 --> 01:46:14.044
Or did you think
it was coincidence

01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:16.691
that all the women in
your life ended up dead?

01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:20.202
Vesper Lynd,
for example.

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:25.082
She was the big one.
Has he told you about her?

01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:30.603
And then, of course,
your beloved M.

01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:33.482
Gone forever.

01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:38.761
Me.

01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:42.722
It was all me, James.

01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.600
It's always been me.
The author of all your pain.

01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.841
You're a brave
woman, my dear.

01:47:00.160 --> 01:47:03.323
Now I understand why
my father lost his mind.

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:06.570
He didn't lose his mind,
he was just weak.

01:47:06.640 --> 01:47:08.642
But at least he understood
what he was up against.

01:47:09.000 --> 01:47:12.209
You see, they failed
to comprehend the crucial fact,

01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:16.006
that a terrible event
can lead to something wonderful.

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.362
Since you mention your father,
I'll show you.

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.886
<i>She's clever. She's smarter than me.</i>

01:47:23.960 --> 01:47:25.200
<i>She knows how to hide.</i>

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:30.444
<i>I can protect her
if you tell me where he is.</i>

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:34.490
<i>I can keep her alive.</i>

01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.800
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:37.086
<i>You have my word.</i>

01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.128
No, no, no. Turn this off.

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:40.804
<i>Your word?</i>

01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:42.805
<i>The word of an assassin!</i>

01:47:42.880 --> 01:47:44.211
Turn this off.

01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:46.362
This is important.
I said turn it off!

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.526
I want you to
understand something.

01:48:01.400 --> 01:48:03.084
<i>That's my word.</i>

01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:05.486
Madeleine?

01:48:06.000 --> 01:48:07.411
Look at me.

01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:12.007
Don't look at him,
Madeleine. Look at me.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:15.370
<i>L'Américain.</i>

01:48:16.560 --> 01:48:18.130
<i>You save her,</i>

01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:21.563
<i>she can lead you to L'Américain.
She knows L'Américain.</i>

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.408
<i>Try the Hoffler Klinik.</i>

01:48:32.920 --> 01:48:37.289
<i>You're a kite dancing in a hurricane,
Mr. Bond.</i>

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.771
<i>So long.</i>

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:52.288
The things that
bring people together.

01:48:56.240 --> 01:48:58.891
Out of horror, beauty.

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:28.250
Torture is easy,
on a superficial level.

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.449
A man can watch himself
being disemboweled

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:35.123
and derive great horror
from the experience,

01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.851
but it's still
going on at a distance.

01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.765
It isn't taking
place where he is.

01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:47.169
As you know all too well, dear Madeleine,
a man lives inside his head.

01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:50.405
That's where
the seat of his soul is.

01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:54.206
Now, James and I were
both present recently

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:56.806
when a man was
deprived of his eyes.

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.088
And the most
astonishing thing happened.

01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:02.321
Didn't you notice?

01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:05.002
He wasn't there anymore.

01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:07.727
He'd gone even though
he was still alive.

01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:11.691
So in this brief moment
between life and death,

01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:14.604
there was nobody
inside his skull.

01:50:16.160 --> 01:50:17.491
Most odd.

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:20.811
So, James.

01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:25.530
I'm going to penetrate

01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:28.721
to where you are.

01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:31.721
To the inside
of your head.

01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:35.565
Now, the first probe
will play with your sight,

01:50:35.920 --> 01:50:37.046
your hearing

01:50:37.680 --> 01:50:39.808
and your balance,

01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:42.724
just with the subtlest
of manipulations.

01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:44.928
Well, get on with it then.

01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.882
Nothing can be as painful
as listening to you talk.

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:51.045
All right.

01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:53.245
Let's begin.

01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:27.882
Why are you doing this?

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:43.208
You probably know
that James here

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:45.408
lost his parents
when he was young.

01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:51.206
But did you know
that it was my father

01:51:51.280 --> 01:51:53.681
who helped him
through this difficult time?

01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.842
Over the course
of two winters

01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:08.130
he taught him to ski,
and climb, and hunt.

01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:13.323
He soothed the wounds
of the poor little blue-eyed orphan.

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:18.645
Asked me to treat
him as a brother.

01:52:19.160 --> 01:52:20.924
My little brother.

01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.482
They formed
quite an attachment.

01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:27.286
So,

01:52:28.120 --> 01:52:29.326
you killed him.

01:52:30.840 --> 01:52:32.330
Yes, I did.

01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:38.525
You know what happens
when a cuckoo

01:52:38.600 --> 01:52:41.524
hatches inside
another bird's nest?

01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:43.961
Yes.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:47.446
It forces
the other eggs out.

01:52:47.520 --> 01:52:48.567
Yes.

01:52:48.840 --> 01:52:53.846
Well, this cuckoo made me realize
my father's life had to end.

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:57.771
In a way, he's responsible
for the path I took.

01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:00.691
- So, thank you.
- Cuckoo.

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:09.444
Do you know any other
birdcalls, Franz?

01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.331
Hello, pussy.

01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:24.647
Franz Oberhauser died
20 years ago, James.

01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:27.485
In an avalanche,
alongside his father.

01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:33.169
The man you are talking to now,
the man inside your head,

01:53:33.880 --> 01:53:36.486
is Ernst Stavro Blofeld.

01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.370
Catchy name.

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:40.882
My mother's bloodline.

01:53:42.360 --> 01:53:46.570
If the needle finds the correct spot
in the fusiform gyrus,

01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:49.082
you'll recognize no one.

01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:50.970
Of course,
the faces of your women

01:53:51.040 --> 01:53:52.929
are interchangeable,
aren't they, James?

01:53:55.080 --> 01:53:56.684
You won't know
who she is.

01:53:56.760 --> 01:54:00.003
Just another passing face
on your way to the grave.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:11.451
He dies not knowing
who you are.

01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:15.609
The daughter
of an assassin.

01:54:16.240 --> 01:54:18.242
The only one
who could have understood him.

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:20.765
Shame.

01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:59.170
I love you.

01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.920
Do those blue eyes
still recognize you?

01:55:11.320 --> 01:55:14.130
I'd recognize
you anywhere.

01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:17.725
The watch.

01:55:33.160 --> 01:55:34.571
One minute.

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:37.490
One minute.

01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:43.284
Did he say something?

01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:44.691
<i>Tempus fugit.</i>

01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:49.205
- What?
<i>- Tempus fugit.</i>

01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:51.682
I can't hear you, James.

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:55.411
I said,

01:55:56.200 --> 01:55:58.043
doesn't time fly?

01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:26.691
In there!

01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.770
Let's go home.

01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:27.644
It's not over yet.

01:58:17.480 --> 01:58:19.050
I've never even
heard of Hildebrand.

01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:22.363
That is the general
idea with safe houses.

01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:40.970
Exactly how safe
is this, sir?

01:58:41.040 --> 01:58:42.883
We're about to find out.

01:58:46.320 --> 01:58:47.810
It's safe.

01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:49.530
Better wait here.

01:58:53.000 --> 01:58:54.126
I'm M.

01:58:54.200 --> 01:58:55.247
Madeleine Swann.

01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:56.320
Pleased to meet you.

01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:58.203
So, what do you
have for me, 007?

01:58:58.280 --> 01:59:02.365
The recently deceased head of Spectre,
Ernst Stavro Blofeld,

01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:06.846
and his chief of intelligence,
your new best friend, C.

01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:11.244
About to take control of his
very own global surveillance system

01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:13.800
that he built right
here under our noses.

01:59:13.880 --> 01:59:16.326
Then we'd better move.
The system goes online at midnight.

01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:19.610
If that happens,
Spectre will have control of everything.

01:59:19.680 --> 01:59:21.648
So, you and I will
have a quiet word with C

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.405
while Q hacks into the system
and stops it going online.

01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:26.041
It won't be easy.

01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:28.521
He'll find a way.
He always does.

01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:35.209
It's good to
have you back, 007.

01:59:36.080 --> 01:59:37.161
Sir.

01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:48.603
James, I can't.

01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:52.284
I'll come back for you
when it's all over.

01:59:53.280 --> 01:59:54.850
No, I can't.

01:59:55.280 --> 01:59:57.282
No, you can't
stay here, or you...

01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:02.170
I can't go back to this life.
And I'm not going to ask you to change.

02:00:02.880 --> 02:00:04.370
This is who you are.

02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:08.690
You're saying good-bye.

02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:10.566
Yes.

02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.091
Take care.

02:00:16.520 --> 02:00:18.522
You're a good man, James.

02:01:19.680 --> 02:01:21.250
Are you in yet, Q?

02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:24.001
A few layers of impenetrable
security still to go,

02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:26.048
<i>but I think
I'm getting somewhere.</i>

02:02:14.480 --> 02:02:16.050
They've seen us! Reverse!

02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:57.121
Go!

02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:10.128
Get him in the building!

02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:12.447
Move. Move!

02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:34.927
Go back and find M, now!
We need them both.

02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:47.244
Not a good feeling
being watched, is it?

02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:53.843
Don't tell me you're
responsible for this.

02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:56.810
No, but my Quartermaster is.

02:04:56.880 --> 02:04:58.609
And he's
extremely talented.

02:04:58.720 --> 02:04:59.767
Well, bravo.

02:04:59.840 --> 02:05:04.243
But in case you hadn't realized it,
you two are out of a job.

02:05:04.320 --> 02:05:05.560
So you're trespassing.

02:05:05.640 --> 02:05:08.086
I'm afraid you've got
the wrong end of the stick, Max.

02:05:08.160 --> 02:05:10.925
We're going to
stop this system going online.

02:05:11.000 --> 02:05:12.411
And then I'm going
to bring you in.

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:14.045
On what grounds exactly?

02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:16.249
Poor taste in friends.

02:05:52.600 --> 02:05:55.001
Take a look at the world.

02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:57.761
Chaos.

02:05:58.880 --> 02:06:00.803
Because people like you,

02:06:00.880 --> 02:06:02.325
paper-pushers
and politicians,

02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:05.967
are too spineless to do
what needs to be done.

02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:09.887
So I made an alliance to put
the power where it should be.

02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:15.000
And now you want to throw
it away for the sake of "democracy."

02:06:15.600 --> 02:06:17.284
Whatever the hell that is.

02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:20.411
How predictably moronic.

02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:23.848
But then isn't that
what M stands for?

02:06:25.680 --> 02:06:27.648
"Moron."

02:06:28.720 --> 02:06:31.041
And now we know
what C stands for.

02:06:35.680 --> 02:06:37.011
"Careless."

02:07:16.280 --> 02:07:17.930
Come on.

02:07:18.040 --> 02:07:19.804
No, no, no!

02:08:24.080 --> 02:08:27.368
You're a hard man
to kill, Blofeld.

02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:35.962
Ouch.

02:08:36.560 --> 02:08:38.289
I do hope that
doesn't hurt too much.

02:08:39.600 --> 02:08:43.047
My wounds will heal.

02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:44.770
What about yours?

02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:48.641
Look around you,
James. Look.

02:08:49.080 --> 02:08:51.287
This is what's
left of your world.

02:08:51.560 --> 02:08:55.770
Everything you ever stood for,
everything you believed in, a ruin.

02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:59.446
Why are we here?

02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:02.444
Did you miss me?

02:09:03.320 --> 02:09:04.606
No.

02:09:11.240 --> 02:09:14.323
But I know someone who does.

02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:23.602
Where is she?

02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.846
That's for you to find out.

02:09:34.360 --> 02:09:37.364
In three minutes,
this building will be demolished.

02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:40.681
I can get out easily.

02:09:40.760 --> 02:09:42.808
Now, you have a choice.

02:09:42.920 --> 02:09:45.446
Die trying to save her or

02:09:45.520 --> 02:09:47.921
save yourself and
live with the pain.

02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:50.206
You're bluffing.

02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:53.881
Am I?

02:10:01.560 --> 02:10:03.680
I've really put you through it,
haven't I?

02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:06.730
That's brothers for you.

02:10:07.720 --> 02:10:11.167
They always know
which buttons to press.

02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:25.608
Madeleine!

02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:32.609
Come on.

02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:34.001
Come on.

02:10:35.520 --> 02:10:37.010
Yes!

02:10:38.640 --> 02:10:40.005
Let's go.

02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:41.721
After you.

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:55.408
Why can't you
just face it, M?

02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:57.925
You don't matter anymore.

02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:00.842
Maybe I don't.

02:11:00.920 --> 02:11:02.126
But something has to.

02:11:57.080 --> 02:11:58.081
Dead.

02:11:58.280 --> 02:11:59.691
- Any word on Bond?
- No.

02:11:59.840 --> 02:12:01.683
But I can hazard a guess.

02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:11.522
Madeleine!

02:12:13.720 --> 02:12:15.768
Madeleine!

02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:01.686
Do you trust me?

02:13:02.040 --> 02:13:03.166
Do I have a choice?

02:13:03.240 --> 02:13:04.241
Not anymore.

02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:16.411
Come on!

02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:33.329
Good-bye, James Bond.

02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:37.610
Brace, brace, brace!

02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:46.680
Sir, this is
a terrorist alert.

02:16:46.799 --> 02:16:47.960
Mallory, double-0 section.

02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:53.208
Stand them down.

02:16:54.639 --> 02:16:56.129
Echo team, hold fire.

02:16:56.440 --> 02:16:58.727
Stand down.

02:17:34.200 --> 02:17:35.325
Finish it.

02:17:46.879 --> 02:17:48.609
Finish it.

02:18:01.160 --> 02:18:02.605
Out of bullets.

02:18:19.520 --> 02:18:21.567
And besides,

02:18:21.879 --> 02:18:23.882
I've got something
better to do.

02:19:10.360 --> 02:19:12.522
Under the Special
Measures Act of 2001,

02:19:12.600 --> 02:19:15.523
I am detaining you on behalf of
Her Majesty's Government.

02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:22.926
Bond?

02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:30.002
What are you doing here?
Good morning, Q.

02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:39.086
I thought you'd gone.

02:20:39.200 --> 02:20:40.326
I have.

02:20:42.200 --> 02:20:44.441
There's just
one thing I need.
