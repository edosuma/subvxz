Hmm. You never know

05:20.446 --> 05:21.780
Bobby?

05:21.846 --> 05:24.147
He walked away
without a scratch.

05:24.212 --> 05:26.446

05:28.546 --> 05:29.613

Nobody can see me

06:17.080 --> 06:19.179
Why?

06:19.246 --> 06:22.312
Uh, it's a gift i have.

06:22.379 --> 06:25.147
Can i just tell you,
you're a little pushy.

06:25.212 --> 06:27.147
If you were in my position,
you would be, too.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.446
Don't you think?

06:28.513 --> 06:29.946
Sorry.

06:30.013 --> 06:32.780
It's been a long night.
Who are you?

06:32.846 --> 06:35.613
My name is hope.
Paulson.

06:35.680 --> 06:37.147
How long have you
been dead?

06:37.212 --> 06:38.613
Since july 4th.

06:38.680 --> 06:40.880
They said everything
was gonna be fine.

06:48.546 --> 06:50.646
They told me i had
an ectopic pregnancy.

06:50.713 --> 06:53.813
I didn't even know
i was pregnant.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.980
I'm only 26 years old.

06:56.047 --> 06:58.846
This wasn't supposed
to happen to me.

06:58.913 --> 07:00.080
Not now.

07:01.446 --> 07:05.646
I was gonna be a mommy.
How is that fair?

07:05.713 --> 07:06.913
It isn't.

07:06.980 --> 07:09.179
Sometimes...

07:09.246 --> 07:12.346
in situations like this
after people have passed away,

07:12.413 --> 07:14.513
i help them cross over.

07:14.579 --> 07:16.413
Do you know
what that means?

07:16.479 --> 07:18.013
Yes.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.446
Is that what you want?
No.

07:19.513 --> 07:21.246
No, um...

07:21.312 --> 07:25.013
my husband hasn't been
the same since i...

07:26.179 --> 07:28.413
he blames himself
for what happened.

07:28.479 --> 07:30.813
That's why you
have to help him.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.646
Have you been
with him since...

07:32.713 --> 07:36.813
yes. He hasn't been sleeping,
or all he does is sleep.

07:36.880 --> 07:40.212
He doesn't see his friends
or his parents or mine.

07:41.713 --> 07:44.212
He hasn't read a book
or gone camping.

07:45.546 --> 07:49.980
See, i know him.
He's a wallower.

07:50.047 --> 07:53.212
He could wallow in this
for the rest of his life.

07:54.713 --> 07:56.713
And i don't want that.

07:56.780 --> 08:00.047
You have to make him
see that.

08:00.113 --> 08:02.179
Please?

08:05.579 --> 08:06.913
I'll try.

08:20.013 --> 08:21.980
Oh, hey, whoa. Whoa.
I'm sorry, luv.

08:22.047 --> 08:24.279
That's ok. I gotta go. Call you back.

08:24.346 --> 08:26.113
I didn't hurt you,
did i?

08:26.179 --> 08:27.279
No bumps?
No bruises?

08:27.346 --> 08:28.513
I'm fine. Really.

08:28.579 --> 08:30.613
'Cause i would hate to
have to buy you lunch.

08:30.680 --> 08:31.946
Oh, you're too late.
Oh.

08:32.013 --> 08:33.413
Love the accent, though.

08:41.379 --> 08:42.312
Morning.

08:42.379 --> 08:43.479
Hey!

08:43.546 --> 08:44.680
How's jim?

08:44.746 --> 08:45.780
Coming home today.

08:45.846 --> 08:48.047
Sexy, sensitive,
and indestructible.

08:48.113 --> 08:49.680
I've gotta get me
a man like that.

08:49.746 --> 08:53.312
Oh, i think you just did.
Tall, australian, hot.

08:53.379 --> 08:54.980
Oh, yeah, mate.

08:55.047 --> 08:58.479
The previous owner of
this 14 karat yellow gold

08:58.546 --> 09:00.013
oyster perpetual
with matte dial,

09:00.080 --> 09:01.780
luminous mercedes hands,

09:01.846 --> 09:05.646
center second sweep,
and screw down crown.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.813
Ooh. Screw down crown,
my favorite part.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.047
Guess how much
i paid for it.

09:09.113 --> 09:11.846
Can i see it?
$1,100.

09:11.913 --> 09:13.446
And he was happy
to get it.

09:13.513 --> 09:16.346
Oh. I think that's worth a
little shrimp on the barbie,

09:16.413 --> 09:18.346
don't you?
Hmm...

09:18.413 --> 09:19.913
what?
Hmm...

09:19.980 --> 09:21.346
what?

09:22.346 --> 09:23.513
It's a fake.

09:23.579 --> 09:26.013
No... no. No way!

09:26.080 --> 09:27.513
Vietnamese, probably.

09:27.579 --> 09:29.346
If it was real, you'd see
the model number. Sorry.

09:29.413 --> 09:32.813
Ooh! God, i can't believe
a guy that cute is a crook!

09:32.880 --> 09:35.346
Oh, and i bet his stupid
accent was fake, too.

09:35.413 --> 09:38.813
It is possible that he did not
know that the watch was fake.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.713
I have a feeling
he'll be back.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.279
Ok...

09:44.613 --> 09:46.746
he found a sucker
he could sell to.

09:46.813 --> 09:48.312
A sucker, huh?

09:48.379 --> 09:50.113
When he comes back, we'll
tell him we want our money,

09:50.179 --> 09:51.279
or we call the cops.

09:51.346 --> 09:52.780
Gee, thank you.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.080
I just wanna thank you again
for being such a good samaritan.

10:17.147 --> 10:20.346
Oh, i... i didn't do
anything. Anybody would've.

10:20.413 --> 10:22.179
No. Not anybody.

10:22.246 --> 10:23.746
Thank you.

10:25.579 --> 10:27.179
How long have you
been married?

10:27.246 --> 10:28.746
7 months.

10:30.746 --> 10:33.179
3 years next march
for me.

10:33.246 --> 10:37.346
My wife hope,
she died last summer.

10:37.413 --> 10:41.346
So... i know what you were
going through last night.

10:41.413 --> 10:43.013
You want to talk
about it?

10:43.080 --> 10:44.379
I mean, you don't
have to. Just...

10:45.746 --> 10:48.147
sometimes it helps.

10:50.946 --> 10:55.113
It was the fourth of july,
we were at a barbecue.

10:56.613 --> 10:58.047
We were having a fight.

10:58.113 --> 11:00.212
I don't even remember
about what.

11:00.279 --> 11:02.413
Something stupid.

11:02.479 --> 11:05.147
She was complaining about
having a stomachache.

11:05.212 --> 11:06.446
She wanted to go home.

11:07.579 --> 11:10.646
I was having too much fun
to go home.

11:10.713 --> 11:15.279
I thought... she doesn't wanna be here,
so she's making it difficult for me.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.346
Typical, huh?

11:24.913 --> 11:26.846
So we stayed.

11:26.913 --> 11:29.413
Played softball
like we did every year.

11:32.913 --> 11:34.880
She just fell over.

11:45.746 --> 11:47.913
I thought she was messing
with me, you know?

11:49.713 --> 11:50.746
She wasn't.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.946
She was really hurting.

11:55.013 --> 11:57.513
Someone said to call 911.

11:57.579 --> 11:59.446
So we did.

11:59.513 --> 12:02.212
She was really hurting.

12:12.780 --> 12:15.613
When we got to the hospital,
she was in shock.

12:26.713 --> 12:30.379
Then they told us
she was pregnant.

12:32.780 --> 12:35.513
And i thought this will be
a good story to tell the kid.

12:35.579 --> 12:37.379
There'll be no problem
whatsoever.

12:39.212 --> 12:44.047
The doctor told us the
fallopian tube had ruptured.

12:44.113 --> 12:45.513
She was hemorrhaging.

12:45.579 --> 12:47.413
That's why she had
the stomachache.

12:47.479 --> 12:49.746
They were gonna
have to do surgery.

12:50.913 --> 12:54.513
Afterwards,
everything seemed fine.

12:54.579 --> 12:56.413
The doctor said everything
went smoothly.

12:58.479 --> 13:01.713
So i sat with her
for a little bit.

13:04.279 --> 13:07.113
She was still so out of it...

13:09.279 --> 13:12.446
so i thought it'd be ok
to go home...

13:14.646 --> 13:16.279
take a shower
and change my clothes.

13:19.147 --> 13:21.513
And that's when i
got the call.

13:26.546 --> 13:30.047
There was a nurse there
when i got back.

13:33.546 --> 13:36.746
He had been in the surgery
with her.

13:36.813 --> 13:38.413
He was crying.

13:43.413 --> 13:45.713
When i saw that, i knew.

13:47.579 --> 13:49.080
I just didn't expect that.

13:50.546 --> 13:52.446
But it wasn't your fault.

13:52.513 --> 13:54.080
It was my fault.

13:59.147 --> 14:00.413
And now she's dead.

14:35.023 --> 14:37.306
uh, i'm looking for
my husband, jim clancy?

14:37.617 --> 14:39.317
Cat scan. Room 133.

14:39.384 --> 14:40.651
Thank you.

14:40.718 --> 14:41.751
Ahh! Oh.

14:41.818 --> 14:43.250
Do you have to do that?

14:43.317 --> 14:45.651
Sorry. Have you
talked to brad?

14:46.818 --> 14:48.117
Yes.
And?

14:48.184 --> 14:49.751
You two really loved
each other, didn't you?

14:49.818 --> 14:51.917
Yeah. Yes, very much.

14:51.983 --> 14:53.850
Did he tell you we
met in high school? No.

14:53.917 --> 14:56.117
Detention. I got caught gluing
sharon scomer's locker shut.

14:56.184 --> 14:58.217
He was there because he refused
to tell the principal

14:58.284 --> 15:02.517
that our friend david went to new
york city with our other friend...

15:02.584 --> 15:04.284
yeah. There are
a lot of us here.

15:06.150 --> 15:07.250
How's jim?

15:07.317 --> 15:09.017
Fine.

15:09.084 --> 15:11.584
Yeah. I get to
take him home today.

15:13.950 --> 15:16.684
Oh, i'm sorry.
I'm a crier.

15:17.950 --> 15:20.751
I cry at the drop of a hat,
just like my mother.

15:22.617 --> 15:24.617
I lied to you before.

15:26.117 --> 15:28.617
When i told you i didn't know
i was pregnant.

15:30.284 --> 15:32.551
I did.

15:32.617 --> 15:34.551
I just hadn't told brad.

15:34.617 --> 15:37.617
I knew the moment
we conceived her.

15:39.451 --> 15:41.117
And i just knew
it was a girl.

15:43.451 --> 15:45.284
He wanted a girl.

15:49.484 --> 15:52.384
I had such big plans.

15:54.417 --> 15:57.784
We had so many plans.

16:02.818 --> 16:04.084
Where were you?

16:04.150 --> 16:05.917
Oh, i, uh...

16:05.983 --> 16:08.250
i know. I figured
the hospital...

16:08.317 --> 16:10.417
you must be
in hog heaven.

16:10.484 --> 16:12.818
You know, sometimes it's not
all it's cracked up to be.

16:13.983 --> 16:15.084
Who is it this time?

16:15.150 --> 16:18.017
A young woman
about my age.

16:18.084 --> 16:19.850
Oh, yeah?
What's her deal?

16:19.917 --> 16:21.551
What's her deal?

16:21.617 --> 16:25.284
Her deal i'd say is she will
never get to enjoy with her husband

16:25.351 --> 16:28.050
all the things
i love about you

16:28.117 --> 16:30.617
and will never ever take
for granted.

16:35.217 --> 16:37.150
Good answer.

16:37.217 --> 16:38.217
Hey...

16:40.883 --> 16:43.584
i'm happy that it's
not you i'm helping.

16:46.784 --> 16:47.784
Me, too.

16:52.284 --> 16:54.050
Ok, let me
get the door.

16:54.117 --> 16:55.584
Oh, yeah.

16:55.651 --> 16:57.250
I don't have any money.
I can't tip you.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.250
Yeah, right.

16:58.317 --> 17:00.050
Don't get used
to it.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.751
Hey, jim get home ok?

17:08.818 --> 17:10.416
Safe and sound.

17:10.483 --> 17:13.084
And why aren't you
there with him?

17:13.150 --> 17:15.916
As soon as i finish this, i'm
going back and making him dinner.

17:15.983 --> 17:18.351
And he likes this special parmesan
that you can only get at bianchi's.

17:19.751 --> 17:20.751
What?

17:21.983 --> 17:23.483
Well, well, well.

17:23.550 --> 17:25.351
Speaking of
foreign cheese.

17:25.416 --> 17:27.017
All right.
Wait.

17:27.084 --> 17:28.117
Wait. Let me do it.

17:28.184 --> 17:29.684
What, you think
i can't handle it?

17:29.751 --> 17:32.117
I just think maybe we should
keep the emotion out of it.

17:34.117 --> 17:35.117
Fine.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.551
Hi.

17:37.617 --> 17:39.184
Oh, it's you.

17:39.250 --> 17:40.384
Can i help you?

17:40.451 --> 17:41.517
How lucky
am i?

17:41.584 --> 17:42.818
Yeah. I don't get out much.

17:42.883 --> 17:44.384
Pity.
Isn't it?

17:44.451 --> 17:48.551
Look, i was wondering if i
might interest you in something.

17:48.617 --> 17:54.384
Antique, art deco platinum, european
cut diamond and pearl necklace.

17:54.451 --> 17:55.551
May i?

17:58.617 --> 18:01.451
Elegant lustrous spheres...

18:01.517 --> 18:03.084
strung between diamond clusters

18:03.150 --> 18:05.850
with a perfectly formed
teardrop pearl

18:05.917 --> 18:07.484
just hanging from the strand.

18:07.551 --> 18:09.617
It's lovely.

18:11.017 --> 18:13.983
Now i can let it go
for say $2,800.

18:14.050 --> 18:16.351
Suppose i sell you
something...

18:16.417 --> 18:21.718
for, let's say, $1,100 and nobody
but you and i know the truth?

18:21.784 --> 18:23.917
What are you suggesting,
i sold you a bad watch?

18:23.983 --> 18:25.517
Oh, i'm not saying
it's bad,

18:25.584 --> 18:27.484
i mean, it keeps very
good time for a fake.

18:27.551 --> 18:29.250
So you say.
So i say.

18:29.317 --> 18:35.317
Now, how do i know you didn't replace
my watch with that piece of junk?

18:35.384 --> 18:37.351
How do i know you're not
trying to highjack me?

18:37.417 --> 18:39.651
This is a small town,
you know.

18:39.718 --> 18:42.050
Why don't you take that into
account when casting aspersions?

18:46.684 --> 18:48.284
And how'd that go down?

18:55.784 --> 18:57.250
It's better with cheese.

18:57.317 --> 18:59.284
I got the kind you like
from bianchi's.

19:04.617 --> 19:06.317
Do you believe in fate?

19:06.384 --> 19:10.584
Or do you believe we've got some
kind of control over our destiny?

19:10.651 --> 19:11.917
Is that a trick question?

19:11.983 --> 19:13.584
Nope. Serious.

19:13.651 --> 19:17.751
Ok, i guess i'd say
i believe in free will.

19:17.818 --> 19:18.850
What do you mean?

19:18.917 --> 19:22.017
I don't have to love you.
I want to.

19:22.084 --> 19:25.751
I choose to, and however
that affects my destiny,

19:25.818 --> 19:28.584
or whatever god, or the gods
have in store for me,

19:28.651 --> 19:30.050
so be it.

19:31.651 --> 19:35.084
What about, um,
accidents?

19:35.150 --> 19:39.150
Hey, do you wanna talk
about what happened?

19:41.417 --> 19:43.617
I should've checked
the tires on the rig.

19:43.684 --> 19:44.818
Yes. Today you know that.

19:44.883 --> 19:46.184
I knew it yesterday.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.784
It's what i do before
every shift, you know.

19:47.850 --> 19:49.317
I check the meds,
i check the supplies,

19:49.384 --> 19:50.950
i check the gas,
the oil...

19:51.017 --> 19:53.451
i check the tires,
but i didn't yesterday

19:53.517 --> 19:55.451
because
i was late for work.

19:55.517 --> 19:57.317
Because i made you late,
you mean.

19:57.384 --> 19:58.784
No, no.
I didn't mean that.

19:58.850 --> 20:01.317
I didn't mean that
at all.

20:01.384 --> 20:03.017
I love that you, uh...

20:04.417 --> 20:07.050
wanted to make me
french toast

20:07.117 --> 20:08.684
for breakfast.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.017
I love that you
wanted to do that...

20:11.084 --> 20:12.184
for me.

20:14.184 --> 20:16.050
Jim, it was an accident.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.617
It cost someone
his life.

20:20.684 --> 20:22.417
Yes, it did.
You didn't.

20:22.484 --> 20:25.317
Accidents happen. They're
a necessary part of life.

20:36.818 --> 20:39.284
So this happened to me
for a reason.

20:39.351 --> 20:42.517
Now a person is dead.

20:42.584 --> 20:45.317
What kind of reason
is that?

20:57.611 --> 20:59.844
You don't have to be in
for 2 hours.

20:59.911 --> 21:01.510
Yeah, i know.

21:01.577 --> 21:03.211
But i should
get there.

21:04.245 --> 21:05.744
2 hours early?

21:09.078 --> 21:10.410
What are you working on?

21:13.278 --> 21:16.278
"Hope paulson. "
Related to brad?

21:16.345 --> 21:17.444
His wife.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.178
Aw, man.

21:20.278 --> 21:21.944
He saved me.

21:22.011 --> 21:22.944
You save her.

21:23.011 --> 21:24.777
No. She's already dead.

21:24.844 --> 21:27.311
I don't know if you can call
what i'm doing saving her.

21:27.377 --> 21:29.311
It's weird how things
work sometimes.

21:29.377 --> 21:30.644
True.

21:30.711 --> 21:32.311
What are you gonna do?

21:32.377 --> 21:34.011
Brad mentioned a nurse.

21:34.078 --> 21:37.311
His name is derrik lee. He was
there during hope's surgery.

21:37.377 --> 21:40.144
If i can get him to tell brad
exactly why his wife died,

21:40.211 --> 21:41.811
specifically that
he's not responsible,

21:41.878 --> 21:44.978
then maybe i can help
get him some closure.

21:45.044 --> 21:45.978
Hmm.

21:46.044 --> 21:47.144
What?

21:47.211 --> 21:49.711
You realize this all
started with you...

21:49.777 --> 21:52.744
making me french toast?

21:52.811 --> 21:56.311
Yeah. Track it. It led to the
accident, which led to brad,

21:56.377 --> 21:58.711
which led to the hospital,
which led to hope.

21:58.777 --> 22:01.178
I mean, are we
the puppet masters...

22:01.245 --> 22:02.944
or are we just the puppets?

22:03.011 --> 22:04.844
You know, i learned
a long time ago,

22:04.911 --> 22:08.611
never question the cosmic
law of french toast.

22:10.111 --> 22:11.577
Gotta go.
All right.

22:13.410 --> 22:14.410
The what?

22:27.510 --> 22:28.611
Hope: He does this
every day,

22:28.677 --> 22:29.944
hammers the sign
into the ground,

22:30.011 --> 22:31.444
pulls it up before
he goes to work.

22:31.510 --> 22:32.444
Hi.
Hi.

22:32.510 --> 22:34.211
Wanna buy a house?

22:34.278 --> 22:36.211
Got one. Thanks.
You moving?

22:36.278 --> 22:39.278
Yeah.
I hate this house.

22:39.345 --> 22:41.477
It's nice.
It's nice.

22:41.544 --> 22:43.311
That's what she
used to say.

22:43.377 --> 22:44.911
Can i ask you
something?

22:44.978 --> 22:46.278
About hope's surgery?

22:46.345 --> 22:47.444
Put me in a good mood.

22:47.510 --> 22:48.811
I know it's none
of my business.

22:48.878 --> 22:50.644
It's just you were so
helpful to jim and me,

22:50.711 --> 22:52.311
and i'd like to
return the favor.

22:52.377 --> 22:53.744
You wanna set me up
with someone?

22:53.811 --> 22:55.477
No.
Good.

22:55.544 --> 22:59.078
I have this ability to help
people during otional crisis.

22:59.144 --> 23:00.978
I'm not a shrink
or anything or a kook.

23:01.044 --> 23:02.811
It's just something i've
always been able to do,

23:02.878 --> 23:04.144
and i would love to...
you know what?

23:04.211 --> 23:05.677
I don't need any help.

23:05.744 --> 23:07.644
I don't deserve any help.

23:07.711 --> 23:09.611
Brad, wait.

23:13.644 --> 23:15.944
You know how many houses
i've sold since my wife died?

23:16.011 --> 23:17.744
Exactly none.

23:17.811 --> 23:19.444
I just think it would be
helpful if you'd maybe

23:19.510 --> 23:21.978
talked to someone who was
actually there when hope died.

23:22.044 --> 23:23.611
What's the point?

23:23.677 --> 23:25.677
Because i think what's
causing you so much pain

23:25.744 --> 23:27.944
is the guilt you're feeling
because you weren't there.

23:28.011 --> 23:30.278
I already talked
to the surgeon

23:30.345 --> 23:31.944
and the hospital
administrator.

23:32.011 --> 23:35.644
I even hired a lawyer
who charged me 5,500 bucks

23:35.711 --> 23:38.345
to tell me that whatever we
accomplished wouldn't bring my wife back.

23:38.444 --> 23:40.144
So, you just wanna be
like everyone else

23:40.211 --> 23:42.311
who tells me to get on
with my life. Well, fine.

23:42.377 --> 23:45.144
How 'bout you get on
with my life?

23:45.211 --> 23:47.211
I'll take yours any day.

23:59.211 --> 24:01.345
There. That's derrik lee.

24:06.211 --> 24:07.144
May i?

24:07.211 --> 24:08.811
Mm, please.

24:08.878 --> 24:11.011
Thanks.
Melinda gordon.

24:11.078 --> 24:12.444
Derrik lee.

24:14.544 --> 24:16.144
I haven't seen you
around.

24:16.211 --> 24:17.510
What department
do you work in?

24:17.577 --> 24:18.844
Oh, i'm not
with the hospital.

24:18.911 --> 24:19.844
Oh.

24:19.911 --> 24:23.278
I, um...
how should i say this?

24:23.345 --> 24:26.811
I represent
a former patient of yours.

24:26.878 --> 24:28.111
Former, as in
discharged?

24:28.178 --> 24:30.510
Former as in
dearly departed.

24:30.577 --> 24:32.510
Hope paulson.

24:35.111 --> 24:37.078
You were her surgical nurse,
right?

24:37.144 --> 24:38.144
Are you her lawyer?

24:38.211 --> 24:41.677
No, no, no.
Um, i'm her advocate.

24:41.744 --> 24:43.611
Actually, i'm here
about her husband brad.

24:43.677 --> 24:46.978
I think you met him.
I've a favor to ask.

24:47.044 --> 24:50.444
I'm sorry,
but i can't help you.

24:50.510 --> 24:53.544
Oh, uh, mr. Lee.

24:53.611 --> 24:55.477
Mr. Lee?

24:55.544 --> 24:56.878
Mr. Lee, please.

24:59.577 --> 25:00.978
Derrik, how are you?

25:01.044 --> 25:02.611
I'm good, doctor.

25:02.677 --> 25:04.377
That's the doctor
who operated on me.

25:04.444 --> 25:05.911
Hi, i'm melinda gordon.

25:05.978 --> 25:09.144
Oh, how you doing?
I'm dr. Devine.

25:09.211 --> 25:11.978
You know, derrik was just telling
me what a wonderful surgeon you are.

25:12.044 --> 25:14.144
Really? Well, you know,
without his help,

25:14.211 --> 25:18.477
i'd probably be bagging
groceries down at the supermarket.

25:18.544 --> 25:19.878
That's what happens

25:19.944 --> 25:21.611
when they put old codgers
like me out to pasture.

25:21.677 --> 25:23.278
I doubt that very much,
doctor.

25:23.345 --> 25:25.944
Hope to see soon again,
mrs. Gordon.

25:26.011 --> 25:28.011
Nice to meet you.

25:39.144 --> 25:40.878
What do you want?

25:40.944 --> 25:43.611
Your help.
Really, that's all.

25:43.677 --> 25:47.144
Brad paulson hasn't been doing
so well since his wife's death.

25:47.211 --> 25:48.944
He blames himself.
You were there.

25:49.011 --> 25:50.311
I thought maybe you
could just talk to him.

25:50.377 --> 25:52.744
It won't do any good.

25:52.811 --> 25:54.844
Why not? It's not
like i'm asking you to...

25:54.911 --> 25:56.410
hey. You don't know
what you're asking.

25:56.477 --> 25:58.311
I am asking you to have
a little empathy

25:58.377 --> 26:01.711
for someone whose wife died
in your care.

26:08.410 --> 26:09.410
Ok.

26:11.211 --> 26:13.811
Ok, you wanna know
what happened?

26:13.878 --> 26:17.911
I'll be in the hospital
archives after my shift, 4:00.

26:17.978 --> 26:19.477
I'll show you.

26:46.345 --> 26:48.944
Long time no see.

26:49.011 --> 26:51.111
You stalking me,
sweetheart?

26:51.178 --> 26:52.444
Hardly.

26:52.510 --> 26:53.944
It's a small town.

26:54.011 --> 26:55.878
Perhaps we're just
fated to meet again.

26:55.944 --> 26:57.444
Hmm.

26:57.510 --> 26:58.878
Allow me.

27:03.377 --> 27:04.477
7 bucks.

27:04.544 --> 27:05.811
Fate is cheap.

27:05.878 --> 27:07.677
You're quite funny.

27:07.744 --> 27:08.878
You're easy.

27:08.944 --> 27:09.878
Have dinner with me.

27:09.944 --> 27:10.978
I said you were easy.

27:11.044 --> 27:12.011
Why not?
Are you married?

27:12.078 --> 27:13.011
No.

27:13.078 --> 27:14.544
Boyfriend?

27:14.611 --> 27:15.744
Not at present.

27:15.811 --> 27:18.111
I'll let you choose
the restaurant then.

27:22.311 --> 27:23.477
I'll think about it.

27:24.978 --> 27:26.144
Lovely.

27:45.844 --> 27:46.844
Hello?

28:12.644 --> 28:13.711
Aah!

28:18.188 --> 28:20.022
Are you crazy?

28:20.088 --> 28:21.022
I'm sorry.

28:21.088 --> 28:22.154
I didn't mean
to scare you.

28:22.221 --> 28:23.287
I just about
had a heart attack.

28:23.354 --> 28:25.055
Ok, well, you weren't
in the archives,

28:25.122 --> 28:26.388
so i came looking for you.

28:26.454 --> 28:28.454
I got lost, ok?

28:32.421 --> 28:37.388
You know, they say
this place is haunted.

28:37.454 --> 28:39.321
I've got news for you.
They're right.

28:39.388 --> 28:40.688
Now let's go.

28:43.088 --> 28:45.354
I don't know
where i'm going.

28:53.454 --> 28:54.888
What's this?

28:54.955 --> 28:56.122
You'll see.

29:00.287 --> 29:01.855
Doctor on videotape:
Suction. Suction.

29:01.921 --> 29:04.554
Doctor, the back
of the tube...

29:04.621 --> 29:07.955
dr. Devine closed without suturing
the backside of the fallopian tube.

29:09.588 --> 29:12.354
That's what i think
killed hope paulson.

29:12.421 --> 29:14.721
What? How is
that possible?

29:14.788 --> 29:16.888
Ego, incompetence.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.221
An accident.

29:18.287 --> 29:19.721
Things happen.

29:19.788 --> 29:21.055
But if you've
got it on tape,

29:21.122 --> 29:23.055
why hasn't anybody
done anything about it?

29:23.122 --> 29:27.254
Because dr. Devine
has been here for 30 years.

29:27.321 --> 29:30.088
He's respected and beloved,

29:30.154 --> 29:33.088
so he's damn near
untouchable.

29:33.154 --> 29:35.321
So nobody did anything?
You didn't?

29:35.388 --> 29:37.254
I tried. Ok?

29:37.321 --> 29:39.755
I filed a complaint
with the review board.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.988
It was investigated
and dismissed.

29:43.055 --> 29:46.755
It's my word against his,
and nobody's gonna take my word.

29:46.821 --> 29:48.955
I can't believe it.

29:49.022 --> 29:50.888
Look, melinda, i'm sorry,
but...

29:50.955 --> 29:52.688
that's just the way it is.

29:53.988 --> 29:55.088
Can i keep this?

29:55.154 --> 29:56.254
Yeah, why not?

29:56.321 --> 29:58.721
This case is dead and buried.

30:10.855 --> 30:15.354
So how did a nice girl like you
end up in a small town like this?

30:15.421 --> 30:18.721
Shouldn't you be off running
the world somewhere?

30:18.788 --> 30:21.655
Actually, i already did.

30:21.721 --> 30:25.287
I was an assistant d. a.
In new york.

30:26.788 --> 30:28.521
Fraud cases, mostly.

30:28.588 --> 30:29.788
Tough guys.

30:34.154 --> 30:36.921
You sold me a counterfeit
watch, didn't you, anthony?

30:36.988 --> 30:39.022
Hi. Would you like
to hear the specials?

30:39.088 --> 30:40.354
Hold on, junior.

30:40.421 --> 30:41.955
You're gonna do the
right thing here, anthony,

30:42.022 --> 30:44.354
starting with
paying me back.

30:44.421 --> 30:45.955
And if you don't,

30:46.022 --> 30:49.788
i'm gonna make it my singular
ambition to put your ass in jail.

30:49.855 --> 30:51.788
I can just come back.
That's no problem.

30:51.855 --> 30:52.788
Don't bother.

30:52.855 --> 30:54.855
You know where
to find me.

31:01.821 --> 31:03.588
Ah, just the check then?

31:03.655 --> 31:05.354
Ok. Ok.

31:24.454 --> 31:26.354
Woman: I love you.

31:26.421 --> 31:27.421
Bye-bye.

31:30.287 --> 31:31.788
Drive carefully.

31:34.321 --> 31:35.788
See you tonight.

31:51.154 --> 31:52.488
Come in.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.421
Mrs. Devine?

32:03.488 --> 32:04.588
Yes.

32:04.655 --> 32:07.088
Hi. I'm melinda gordon.

32:10.788 --> 32:12.554
Yes?

32:12.621 --> 32:15.788
I was just wondering if i could
talk to you about your husband.

32:15.855 --> 32:18.788
My husband has an illness.

32:20.821 --> 32:23.721
Early onset dementia.

32:23.788 --> 32:27.221
I was in denial for years.

32:27.287 --> 32:31.621
On any given day,
he still is.

32:31.688 --> 32:33.321
He's this bad?

32:33.388 --> 32:35.888
Not yet.

32:35.955 --> 32:38.388
But he will be.

32:38.454 --> 32:40.955
I made those cards for him.

32:41.022 --> 32:43.388
It'll help here
in the house.

32:43.454 --> 32:45.421
But i can't protect him
out there.

32:45.488 --> 32:48.187
At work, for example.

32:50.321 --> 32:53.788
It must be so devastating to see
your husband going through this.

32:55.321 --> 32:58.655
I've been praying for somebody
to help me help him.

32:58.721 --> 33:00.788
I don't know
where you came from,

33:00.855 --> 33:02.921
but you are a blessing.

33:02.988 --> 33:06.621
I think my husband
might say it's fate.

33:06.688 --> 33:09.655
Fate or not,
mine won't go gently.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.022
No.

33:11.088 --> 33:13.588
But you'll be right
there to hold his hand.

33:13.655 --> 33:14.921
Yes, i will.

33:21.287 --> 33:24.221
Dr. Devine's
losing his mind?

33:24.287 --> 33:26.855
Losing his mind
would be a blessing.

33:26.921 --> 33:30.888
It's deteriorating
slowly.

33:30.955 --> 33:35.721
Sometimes people know what's happening
to them and are able to hide it

33:35.788 --> 33:39.554
until they can't,
and then...

33:39.621 --> 33:41.855
sometimes
people get hurt.

33:41.921 --> 33:43.454
You mean like me.

33:44.955 --> 33:47.122
Yes, like you.

33:48.454 --> 33:50.055
Because of his illness,

33:50.122 --> 33:53.254
dr. Devine forgot to properly
suture your fallopian tube,

33:53.321 --> 33:55.921
something he's done
a thousand times.

33:55.988 --> 33:58.488
He made a mistake?!

33:58.554 --> 33:59.988
Is that what
you're telling me?

34:06.154 --> 34:08.054
I'm sorry.

34:13.286 --> 34:15.588
I'm sorry.

34:26.014 --> 34:27.114
Am i supposed
to feel good

34:27.181 --> 34:28.281
that my wife
was the victim

34:28.348 --> 34:29.781
of a doctor's
stupid mistake?

34:29.847 --> 34:34.614
No. But if you'll allow
yourself, maybe relieved.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.781
At least now you know
you weren't to blame.

34:39.681 --> 34:42.714
Brad, if you could talk to hope
right now, what would you say?

34:44.914 --> 34:46.947
I can't,
so what's the point?

34:47.014 --> 34:47.981
Why can't you?

34:48.047 --> 34:49.880
She's dead.

34:49.947 --> 34:51.315
Can you talk
to the dead?

34:51.380 --> 34:54.714
He always was
a know-it-all.

34:54.781 --> 34:57.514
Brad, if you could say
anything at all,

34:57.580 --> 35:00.014
anything, what would it be?

35:00.081 --> 35:01.381
I'd say...

35:05.881 --> 35:07.214
i'd say...

35:10.048 --> 35:11.647
good-bye.

35:14.981 --> 35:16.415
I can't.

35:24.480 --> 35:25.614
"Brad...

35:25.681 --> 35:29.048
"i know you feel
like this is your fault,

35:29.114 --> 35:32.114
"but i want you to know
that i don't blame you.

35:32.181 --> 35:35.781
"You've always taken better care
of me than i have myself.

35:35.847 --> 35:37.214
"From the day i first...

35:37.281 --> 35:38.547
hope, takes over: ... laid
eyes on you in detention.

35:38.614 --> 35:40.948
And that hasn't
changed today.

35:41.014 --> 35:43.948
I never felt more
in love with you

35:44.014 --> 35:49.114
than when i watched you all
worried and sweaty and care-worn,

35:49.181 --> 35:52.014
running beside the gurney
when they wheeled me in here.

35:52.081 --> 35:57.447
So please, please...

35:57.514 --> 36:00.881
don't wallow.

36:06.381 --> 36:10.647
Oh, and if i'm not awake
when you get back...

36:11.981 --> 36:14.480
don't forget to feed
daisy and walk her.

36:18.814 --> 36:20.480
Melinda's voice joins:
See you tomorrow.

36:22.480 --> 36:23.814
I love you.

36:25.148 --> 36:26.148
Hope. "

36:39.014 --> 36:40.248
Well...

36:46.948 --> 36:48.181
i guess we're even.

36:59.014 --> 37:00.014
Thank you.

37:29.647 --> 37:31.480
Oh. Heh.

37:31.547 --> 37:34.981
Can i help you? Um, do
you have an appointment?

37:35.048 --> 37:39.214
No. No, but i'd like to help you
if you'll let me.

37:39.281 --> 37:40.981
What do you mean?
I don't, uh...

37:41.048 --> 37:43.014
i know about your condition.

37:44.514 --> 37:45.647
What condition?

37:45.714 --> 37:47.714
I talked to your wife.

37:47.781 --> 37:49.148
Margaret?
Yes.

37:49.214 --> 37:50.781
I've been to your house.
I've seen the cards.

37:50.847 --> 37:51.914
She told me everything.

37:51.981 --> 37:55.181
I don't believe you.
She would never...

37:55.248 --> 37:58.948
your wife has been dead
for 2 years.

37:59.014 --> 38:00.547
Margaret?

38:02.514 --> 38:04.114
For god's sake.

38:04.181 --> 38:07.514
You have to stop practicing
medicine, matthew.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.148
That's why i stayed.

38:09.214 --> 38:12.914
That's the only reason i
stayed, to help you do that.

38:12.981 --> 38:15.847
She says you have to stop
practicing medicine.

38:15.914 --> 38:17.681
She stayed to help you.

38:17.747 --> 38:20.248
You had such
a wonderful career.

38:20.315 --> 38:22.415
You've achieved everything
you ever wanted to.

38:22.480 --> 38:24.148
It's time to let go.

38:24.214 --> 38:25.547
I'm calling security.

38:25.614 --> 38:27.148
Wait.
Wait.

38:27.214 --> 38:30.014
There was a proverb he used
to quote. He'll remember.

38:30.081 --> 38:32.381
She says that you used
to quote a proverb.

38:32.447 --> 38:37.781
Who is this skilled physician,
but he who prevents illness?

38:37.847 --> 38:40.081
She says, who's this
skilled physician...

38:40.148 --> 38:41.114
but he...

38:41.181 --> 38:45.681
it's he...
who can prevent...

38:47.181 --> 38:49.248
illness. Yes.

38:51.014 --> 38:53.881
You're not that man
anymore, my love.

38:53.948 --> 38:56.447
Margaret:
I think you know that.

38:56.514 --> 38:58.348
But how?

39:00.514 --> 39:02.415
How could you
possibly have known?

39:02.480 --> 39:04.281
She says it
breaks her heart,

39:04.348 --> 39:07.981
but you're not
that doctor anymore.

39:10.514 --> 39:12.847
You don't have
to pretend anymore.

39:14.114 --> 39:17.948
She's giving you
permission not to.

39:33.881 --> 39:37.547
Hey! Guess what miracle
happened while you were out.

39:37.614 --> 39:39.114
Can't imagine.

39:39.181 --> 39:41.480
The watch guy showed up.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.614
Apparently, he just
couldn't live with himself

39:44.681 --> 39:46.447
knowing
he'd ripped us off.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.781
Huh...

39:48.847 --> 39:51.348
i guess the glass
really is half full today.

39:55.248 --> 39:56.348
Thanks, bobby.

39:56.415 --> 39:57.547
Bobby: Hey,
no problem.

40:05.714 --> 40:08.114
That was bobby.

40:08.181 --> 40:10.580
You told him no softball tonight, right?

40:10.647 --> 40:13.081
The police id'd
my john doe.

40:13.148 --> 40:18.315
Turns out he was released
from prison last week in ohio.

40:18.381 --> 40:20.514
7 years
for attempted murder.

40:20.580 --> 40:22.514
God.

40:22.580 --> 40:25.181
Told his cellmate
that when he got out

40:25.248 --> 40:28.681
he was gonna find his old
lady and "fix her for good. "

40:28.747 --> 40:32.647
He was 2 miles from her house
when he crashed the motorcycle.

40:32.714 --> 40:35.381
So... if i hadn't
picked him up

40:35.447 --> 40:37.881
or if he'd recovered...

40:37.948 --> 40:40.348
he might have come back
and killed his wife.

40:42.847 --> 40:44.514
Well...

40:44.580 --> 40:48.315
once again...
cosmic law of french toast.

40:48.381 --> 40:49.547
]sighs]

40:53.614 --> 40:54.681
Come in.

40:54.747 --> 40:55.981
