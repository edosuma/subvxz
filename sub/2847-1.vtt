Hello, everybody.
I'm Dave McClelland,

00:38.038 --> 00:42.008
and welcome to the 24th annual
NHRA U.S. Nationals

00:42.009 --> 00:45.011
at Indianapolis Raceway Park.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.980
A lot of stories have developed
at the U.S. Nationals

00:47.981 --> 00:50.750
through four full days
of qualifying.

00:50.751 --> 00:54.654
This is one of the longest rivalries
in drag-racing history...

Don "The Snake" Prudhomme
of Granada Hills, California,

01:00.527 --> 01:03.195
against his longtime friend
and nemesis,

01:03.196 --> 01:06.766
Tom "The Mongoose" McEwen
of Fountain Valley, California.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.701
Prudhomme got
his nickname "The Snake"

01:08.702 --> 01:11.203
because of his
amazingly quick reflexes

01:11.204 --> 01:12.505
on the starting line.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.875
These two have a history
going back two decades.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.877
They even raced together
in a partnership...

01:17.878 --> 01:19.745
the Wildlife Racing team.

01:19.746 --> 01:22.548
What better than when you have
a snake and a mongoose

tour the country?

in racing this afternoon.

on that Christmas tree.

You know, my parents, they don't
let me drive another dragster,

11:39.332 --> 11:40.732

12:16.202 --> 12:18.370
Hello, Tommo.
What can I do for you?

12:18.371 --> 12:20.672
Well, I got a favor to ask you.

12:20.673 --> 12:22.477
Why don't you take a look
at this for me?

12:23.509 --> 12:25.944
"The Mongoose bites the Snake."

12:25.945 --> 12:28.380
- TOM: Yeah, yeah. You get it?
- Yes, I do. I like it.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.716
Yeah, yeah, I knew you would.
I knew you could.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.217
All right, cool, Mikey.
I'll see you later.

12:32.218 --> 12:33.920
Ah, thanks.

12:34.787 --> 12:38.958
"The Mongoose bites the Snake."

from making me sick.

13:12.258 --> 13:15.530
- But now you're here.
- Right.

13:16.763 --> 13:19.331

- Nope.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.099

There's really no need for all that
running off at the mouth, is there?

13:30.176 --> 13:33.512
Now pay no mind to it.
It's just publicity.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.148
No, don't get paint on it, dummy.

13:36.149 --> 13:37.949
You think all this Mongoose
and Snake nonsense

13:37.950 --> 13:39.618
is going to make any difference?

13:39.619 --> 13:41.586
Not on the track, it won't,

13:41.587 --> 13:43.121

Yeah, well, I say
let the cars do the talking.

13:46.959 --> 13:48.493
Well, every time
they open their mouths,

13:48.494 --> 13:50.095
it costs money, Don.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.298
That's why we have sponsors, right?

13:53.099 --> 13:54.800
Well, there's got to be
a lot more to it

13:54.801 --> 13:57.469

to make the time, Don.

that might not happen.

costs money.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.056
- I know that.
- All right? We have no idea.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.358
So let's get an idea.

Tom is always coming up
with a way to make some money.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.731
Maybe it's time
that we heard him out,

20:32.732 --> 20:34.775
took him seriously for a change.

20:35.568 --> 20:38.103
He changed his name
to Mongoose, for Christ's sakes.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.839

20:40.840 --> 20:43.374
You're part of this
whether you like it or not,

20:43.375 --> 20:46.488
so we might as well see
if we can make some money with it.

20:47.346 --> 20:49.287
Mongoose and Snake.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.487
Don, it's pretty catchy.

20:56.055 --> 20:57.756
If it's that important to you,

20:57.757 --> 21:00.767
I'll track him down
and see what he's got cooking.

21:01.560 --> 21:03.330
That's all I'm asking.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.030

on me, I swear...

don't freewheel,

and don't lift.

- Damn straight.
- My point exactly.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.889
All right.

21:30.890 --> 21:32.592
Rack 'em up, Mike.

21:33.559 --> 21:35.093
Got to read the starter, man.

21:35.094 --> 21:37.762
He'll have certain gestures, tics,

21:37.763 --> 21:39.764
preferences in the way
he moves that'll give it away,

21:39.765 --> 21:42.000
and then he wraps it up,
puts a bow on it,

21:42.001 --> 21:44.102
and hands me a single
1/100 of a second.

21:44.103 --> 21:46.471

that track, it's my birthday.

Talk to you a second?

22:00.286 --> 22:02.153
I'm sorry.
I couldn't really hear you.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.956
Did you say that the Snake
wanted to talk to me?

22:04.957 --> 22:07.125
Forget it. Enjoy your game.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.594
No, no. Come on.
Now don't be a baby.

22:09.595 --> 22:11.262
Come on.

22:11.263 --> 22:13.464
Guys, can you give me a moment
with the Snake, please?

22:13.465 --> 22:16.043
- Sure. Nice going, Mike.
- You got it.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.637
Well, you were right, Torn.

22:19.638 --> 22:21.472
I usually am.

22:21.473 --> 22:23.007
What about this time?

22:23.008 --> 22:24.709
Even when I win, I lose.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.412
That's true.

22:28.480 --> 22:30.023
So...

22:31.517 --> 22:33.856
...how are we going to make
some serious money at this?

22:34.820 --> 22:36.788
Serious money?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.723
Truth is we could race
up and down the country

22:38.724 --> 22:40.491
till we're blue in the face,

22:40.492 --> 22:42.327

swamping the track,

of the gate receipts...

22:45.564 --> 22:46.731
(BILLIARD BALLS CLACK)

22:46.732 --> 22:48.872
well, we might as well be playing
to an empty house.

22:50.035 --> 22:51.736
I mean, you're making
a living, right?

22:51.737 --> 22:54.906
You know damn well 500 bucks
a month ain't a living, Tom.

22:54.907 --> 22:56.975
Just me out there.
I don't have Mommy to help me out.

22:56.976 --> 23:00.511
Oh, hey, now, we all got to use
what we got, Donny.

23:00.512 --> 23:02.046
Is there any money
in this Snake-and-Mongoose thing

23:02.047 --> 23:03.581
you keep talking about?

23:03.582 --> 23:07.252
Well, you got to work together
with me on that, Donny.

23:07.253 --> 23:10.188
I mean, that takes time and effort
on and off the track

23:10.189 --> 23:11.891
to make an idea like that go.

23:15.261 --> 23:17.328
Well, you see, the truth is

23:17.329 --> 23:19.736
fast food makes more money
than fast cars.

23:20.532 --> 23:21.766
What the hell does that mean?

23:21.767 --> 23:23.234
You been talking in riddles
the whole time?

23:23.235 --> 23:25.737
Without the burger, you wouldn't
need the arches, right?

23:25.738 --> 23:28.873
But without the arches,
it'd just be another hamburger.

23:28.874 --> 23:32.210
So I'm the hamburger
and you're the arches.

- but...
- I got it. I got it.

23:37.783 --> 23:40.251
No, no, Don,
it's like I've been saying,

23:40.252 --> 23:44.764

to think big to make it big.

we take it on tour.

All right,
we get to call the shots,

not the track owners,

24:06.545 --> 24:08.479

24:08.480 --> 24:10.114
I mean, think about it.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.649
I got 10 tracks already lined up,

willing to pay us a grand
just to show up.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.153
Really? Like who?

24:15.154 --> 24:17.755
Well, like McWhorter
in Bakersfield for example.

24:17.756 --> 24:19.791
That old coot still owes me 100.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.893
Come on,
we do three races, all right,

24:21.894 --> 24:23.628
and then we're down the road
to the next track,

24:23.629 --> 24:25.163
all the way to Dallas.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.266

make some serious dough.

- Yeah.

bored of me beating you every time?

24:34.506 --> 24:36.310
Just look at the schedule, Don.

24:37.343 --> 24:39.318
All right. Hell...

24:40.779 --> 24:42.447
...let's do it.

24:42.448 --> 24:45.249
But it's Snake and Mongoose,
not the other way around.

24:45.250 --> 24:47.555
Hoo! Keep dreaming, brother.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.408
No, of course Snake will be there.

25:36.869 --> 25:39.777
Well, yeah, I know him.
He's here with me.

No, no. He'll not take 1,000.

when you're out there

things have been.

34:37.708 --> 34:41.210
Without even trying,
we pack the stands every weekend,

34:41.212 --> 34:43.013
either together or separately.

34:43.014 --> 34:47.094
What you have in your office right
here is the biggest draw in racing.

34:47.918 --> 34:52.289
Now, together, as a team,
sponsored by Mattel Hot Wheels,

34:52.290 --> 34:56.527
driving cars with the Hot Wheels
logo big and bold on the sides,

34:56.527 --> 34:58.762
well, hell, we're
200-mile-per-hour billboards.

34:58.763 --> 35:02.066
Drag racing attracts more kids
than any other kind of auto racing,

35:02.067 --> 35:05.569
more than stock cars or sprints,
hell, more than the Indy 500.

35:05.570 --> 35:07.237
Why? Because we're fast.

35:07.238 --> 35:10.040
And we're flashy
with fiery burnouts.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.241
Hell, instant winners.

35:11.242 --> 35:13.277
Kids can walk the pits,
meet the drivers.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.613
- You know, hell, we're...
- Accessible?

35:15.614 --> 35:17.748
You're damn right we're accessible.

35:17.749 --> 35:20.985
We are in real life
what Hot Wheels is in miniature.

35:20.986 --> 35:23.554
- And there's TV coverage, right?
- For the big events.

35:23.555 --> 35:27.224
So our logo gets across the finish line
first in front of millions of viewers?

35:27.225 --> 35:29.259
- Damn right it does.
- Well, we can't guarantee

35:29.260 --> 35:30.761
one of us will win every time.

35:30.762 --> 35:32.663
It'd be better if you did.

35:32.664 --> 35:35.833
How much funding do you think
you'd need to pull this off?

35:35.834 --> 35:37.968
Oh...

35:37.969 --> 35:43.941
100 grand should be enough
to build two funny cars,

35:43.942 --> 35:45.576
record-setting cars, of course.

35:45.577 --> 35:46.944
Funny cars?

35:46.945 --> 35:48.479
Oh, there it is.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.814
- Yeah.
- Very cool.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.858
- That's it right there.
- Look, guys.

35:53.985 --> 35:56.286
ART: Oh.

35:56.287 --> 35:58.689
Well, trophies are fine,

35:58.690 --> 36:00.357
but I'm looking for branding.

36:00.358 --> 36:03.127
I want every kid in America
to buy Hot Wheels.

36:03.128 --> 36:05.129
Not just to know the brand,

36:05.130 --> 36:07.031
but to love it,

36:07.032 --> 36:09.075
like...

36:10.669 --> 36:12.770
well, like Barbie.

36:12.771 --> 36:14.304
(CHUCKLES)

36:14.305 --> 36:19.309
Mr. Spear, you put these
cartoon characters on the cars,

36:19.310 --> 36:21.353
and you watch the kids go nuts.

36:22.447 --> 36:24.649
The more I think about this...

36:26.284 --> 36:28.020
the more I like it.

36:29.554 --> 36:31.689
So he just keeps a Barbie
sitting in his desk like that?

36:31.690 --> 36:32.856
(LAUGHS) I guess so.

36:32.857 --> 36:36.360
But, brother, we're about
to become a team, the team.

36:36.361 --> 36:39.797
Well, what do you think
about Wildlife Racing as a name?

36:39.798 --> 36:41.832
I mean, you're the Snake.
I'm the Mongoose.

36:41.833 --> 36:45.002
- Kind of makes sense, right?
- Wildlife Racing.

36:45.003 --> 36:47.171
Hell, the way you drive,
I guess that does make sense.

36:47.172 --> 36:48.373
Very funny.

37:00.752 --> 37:03.899
(ENGINES ROARING)

37:06.257 --> 37:08.225

- This is the real deal here, Donny.

37:09.761 --> 37:11.862
Chop-chop. Let's get out of here.

37:11.863 --> 37:13.397

37:13.398 --> 37:15.833
Let's go, guys. Don. Don.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.435
Tommy, let's go.
Spear wants a photograph.

37:18.436 --> 37:21.205
- Let's line it up.
- Hey, lose the cigarette.

37:21.206 --> 37:23.407
Now that Coke's a sponsor,
they want one too.

37:23.408 --> 37:24.875
- Ready for this? Look good.
- Here we go.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.510
- Right this way, girls.
- Shake my hand.

37:26.511 --> 37:28.418
Look pretty. Here we go. Smile.

37:48.900 --> 37:50.602
Don, smile.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.972
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mike, is that big voice

37:54.973 --> 37:56.974
we hear at the track
your real voice?

37:56.975 --> 37:59.076
- You mean this one?
- Yeah, that one.

37:59.077 --> 38:01.578
(HIGH-PITCHED) No. Actually,
this is my real voice,

38:01.579 --> 38:03.614

You like it?

- Buddy, you're right.
- "Super Stock," huh?

38:10.155 --> 38:12.289
Oh, look at that.
We're on the cover.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.491
Oh, look at that.
Your name's first.

38:14.492 --> 38:17.561
It's 'cause I'm prettier.
Ah, hell, come on.

38:17.562 --> 38:19.096
You said you didn't care
about any of that anyway.

38:19.097 --> 38:20.564
- Yeah, I didn't.
- Uh-huh.

38:20.565 --> 38:21.765
Will you two stop arguing?

38:21.766 --> 38:23.233
Here, Don. Make yourself useful.

38:23.234 --> 38:24.468
Uh..

38:24.469 --> 38:27.571
Hey, Don, can't wait to see
your new Hot Wheels cars.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.339
Are they going to be
the same as the big cars?

38:29.340 --> 38:30.574
Oh, yeah, buddy.

38:30.575 --> 38:33.051
They're going to be identical,
just a little smaller.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.180
- Ready?
- Ooh!

- At your mom's.

38:53.932 --> 38:56.133
I thought they wanted
to see me off.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.745
We need to talk.

38:59.037 --> 39:02.639
What? I kind of thought
we already did.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.775
Me being alone with the kids,
it's not working.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.944
I need you at home, Torn.

39:06.945 --> 39:08.679
Well, I can't make
a living at home.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.615
Yes, you can.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.150
You just don't want to.

39:13.151 --> 39:14.651

we are finally getting
everything we always wanted.

This is everything
you wanted, Torn.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.939
This is your dream, not mine.

39:31.836 --> 39:35.916
I... I'm just not cut out for it.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.644
What about us?

39:40.645 --> 39:42.846
The kids?

39:42.847 --> 39:45.515
They'll visit when they can,

39:45.516 --> 39:48.560
and you can see them
when you're in town.

45:51.082 --> 45:54.251
Oh, I hope not.
No, Garlits is a machine.

45:54.252 --> 45:56.286
He's going to be back
driving within the month.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.421
I can hear him at the hospital
giving 'em hell, right?

45:58.422 --> 45:59.589
"You don't race, you don't eat."

45:59.590 --> 46:01.391
(LAUGHS)
Yeah, it sounds like Big Daddy.

46:01.392 --> 46:03.093
You know, he could
have been killed.

46:03.094 --> 46:05.262
You guys act like he broke
his damn nail.

46:05.263 --> 46:08.098
Well, accidents happen.
I mean, it is what it is.

46:08.099 --> 46:09.966
Is that what you think, Don?

46:09.967 --> 46:12.435
I don't think about it, honestly.
I just drive.

46:12.436 --> 46:15.480
- Come on, Lynn.
- Okay. That's great.

46:16.907 --> 46:19.042
Oh, don't forget the old briefcase.

Hey, hey, hey, now. Hands off the...
that's not for you, Don.

46:20.911 --> 46:23.246
For Christ's sakes!
The two of you need to grow up.

46:23.247 --> 46:25.448

all one big game.

46:27.885 --> 46:30.387
Yeah, grow up.
You're killing me here.

- I miss you, man.
- Miss you too, Dad.

46:38.963 --> 46:40.597
I thought we were coming to Denver.

46:40.598 --> 46:44.334
Yeah, yeah, that was the plan,
but I guess things changed.

46:44.335 --> 46:46.803
Besides, you guys are probably
having a better time out there.

46:46.804 --> 46:49.139
It's okay. You winning a lot?

46:49.140 --> 46:50.740
Hey, yeah, I'm winning a lot.

46:50.741 --> 46:53.310
I could sure use
my best mechanic, though.

46:53.311 --> 46:57.113
Well, listen, bud, I got to go,
so give Joey a kiss for me,

46:57.114 --> 46:59.582

to call Tommy tomorrow.

not to run those 430s, Tommy.

You can see what happens when you
don't hit your shift points.

47:59.009 --> 48:00.176
You know what I mean?

48:00.177 --> 48:02.045
It's like dropping a hand grenade
down in the middle of the motor.

No, Don and I are running.
We're just not running the funnies.

We're going to both go after
the Top Fuel championship.

49:04.708 --> 49:05.975
What does that mean for Mattel?

Well, it means the funnies
will have to stay in the trucks.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.647
Also means I get to defend
my Top Fuel title.

49:10.648 --> 49:13.216
We have $100,000 invested in
this team to race funny cars.

49:13.217 --> 49:15.618
And what have you made back,
about 10 times that?

49:15.619 --> 49:18.455
It's true. They've been
our fastest sellers.

Oh, hey, which one's
selling faster, me or Don?

A million dollars?

49:31.435 --> 49:32.969
Next Christmas, we're coming out

with a brand-new Mongoose

a huge amount of money

we can and can't do, all right?

is that we're not magicians.

a long time ago, Art,

49:54.625 --> 49:57.360
we can't control
the outcome of a race.

50:01.165 --> 50:03.266

- Yes, please.

- Yeah, I get it.

- Wow. Gee, thanks.
- You're welcome.

51:19.910 --> 51:23.212
So we both think
that this Spear's deal

51:23.213 --> 51:25.248
is way too one-sided, and...

51:25.249 --> 51:27.116
Look, if they're going
to invest a million dollars

51:27.117 --> 51:28.918
into a race set of the two of you,

51:28.919 --> 51:31.287
then they're relying on our names
on a whole 'nother level.

51:31.288 --> 51:32.722
DON: Yeah, they need us
now more than ever.

51:32.723 --> 51:33.890
Right.

51:33.891 --> 51:36.359
We need to get them
to sponsor both cars,

- I race Top Fuel.
- All right, Don. Okay, hold on.

Tom, we're talking about two more
Hot Wheels for them to sell.

- DON: Is that more your language?
- All right, I get that.

51:47.972 --> 51:50.440
That does not mean
I'm racing the 'Cuda at Indy.

51:50.441 --> 51:52.141
I think you made that
pretty clear yesterday.

51:52.142 --> 51:54.777
I told Spear we're going to get
the 'Cuda on the track.

51:54.778 --> 51:57.880
What I didn't tell him was
who's going to be behind the wheel.

51:57.881 --> 52:00.116
So you're getting
another driver for me?

52:00.117 --> 52:02.552
What are you going to pull out of,
Top Fuel or funny?

52:02.553 --> 52:03.953
Neither.

for the team, run both.

yourself from pit to pit.

got to take a leak?

just stand in awe

at some of the mechanical

56:03.327 --> 56:04.493
and personal performances

56:04.494 --> 56:07.732
by some of the top drag-racing
drivers in the world.

56:13.704 --> 56:15.705
An incredible blast of power

defeats Danny Ongais.

Oh, I don't want to hear it,
you pompous prick.

57:16.099 --> 57:18.768
You think I'm not serious
about racing,

57:18.769 --> 57:21.070
that I don't want to win
a championship as bad as you do?

57:21.071 --> 57:22.738
Trying to pay you
a damn compliment, all right?

57:22.739 --> 57:24.440
Yeah, yeah. Very inspirational.

Hey, Donny.

57:26.877 --> 57:28.811
So you lost, all right?

57:28.812 --> 57:30.947
You don't think all this fooling around
interferes with the way you race?

57:30.948 --> 57:33.749
- Come on.
- Remember this was fun, Don?

57:33.750 --> 57:35.751
This was fun for me...

57:35.752 --> 57:38.054
the speed, the noise, the girls.

57:38.055 --> 57:40.257
Winning is fun, Tom. Damn it.

she's always wanted, huh?

- Or you just ain't got it in you?
- What do you know about it, huh?

57:52.970 --> 57:54.437
So I don't wanna have kids
and leave 'em without a father.

57:54.438 --> 57:56.305
- So what?
- I didn't have a father, and here I am.

57:56.306 --> 57:57.940

working out for you?

the dirty work with Spear,

Well, maybe I had enough
of picking up the pieces.

Don't let Spear catch those
trophy girls in there, all right?

58:15.492 --> 58:17.259

- Get your hands off me.

It caromed at least
350 feet down the track

59:42.446 --> 59:44.580
and bounced over into the grass.

59:44.581 --> 59:47.116

appears to be all right.

- Was he dragging

- Okay, all right. Listen.

Yeah, yeah.
See, you hit this top here.

01:05:35.198 --> 01:05:36.732
- You slam on it...
- Huh.

01:05:36.733 --> 01:05:41.103
...and it fills the cage
with this fire-retardant powder.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:42.704
- I mean, voilà.
- (CHUCKLES)

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:44.606
"Voilà."

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.514
Yeah, it's French, Don.

01:05:47.577 --> 01:05:49.445
Hey, why don't you hang on
a second here, buddy, okay?

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:52.320
I'll be right back.
Don't go driving off on me.

01:05:54.918 --> 01:05:58.120
Hey, Nicoll was just plain unlucky.
That's all there is to it, Don.

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:01.302
You believe in luck, then you
know it's going to run out.

01:06:02.158 --> 01:06:04.226
Well, while you were holed up
for the past two months

01:06:04.227 --> 01:06:06.628

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:09.498

to Bakersfield.

01:06:09.499 --> 01:06:10.799
- Top Fuel?
- Yeah.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.134
Yeah.

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:14.736
And even though I'm just the mouth,

01:06:14.737 --> 01:06:16.439
I won it.

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:21.143
Hey, we all got to die
someday, Snake.

01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.153
Can't live your life
in fear of that.

01:06:24.781 --> 01:06:26.315
Now what else
are you going to do, huh?

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.359
You going to go back
to painting cars?

01:06:29.319 --> 01:06:32.254

going on outside of this.

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:34.323
You and me,
we are drag racers, man.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.834

I got to drive 'em anymore.

out there, Don.

Snake or Mongoose?

Hey, great new colors.

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:06.915
You mean the same cars, Art?
They look the same to me.

01:08:06.916 --> 01:08:09.685
Those cars were number-one and
number-two best sellers last year.

01:08:09.686 --> 01:08:11.219
Don't fix it if it ain't broken.

- Yeah.

01:08:20.729 --> 01:08:22.264
Somehow the same color.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:26.470
Here, Art. This is our schedule
for the next six months.

01:08:27.569 --> 01:08:29.571
Not a lot of dates open for us.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:34.042
which is great for both of us.

01:08:34.042 --> 01:08:36.444
We can keep racing cars,
and you can keep selling 'em.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:38.447
I hope so, Tom.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:40.282

- Hit the button, Don.
- Yeah.

You can go right in.

Well, Tom, Don,
Hot Wheels' marketing team

01:10:30.893 --> 01:10:32.427
has decided to make some changes.

01:10:32.428 --> 01:10:34.096
What kind of changes?

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:35.831
I'm sorry, but Mattel
will not be renewing

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:38.100
our major sponsorship
with Wildlife Racing.

01:10:38.101 --> 01:10:40.035
But you said our cars
were your best sellers.

01:10:40.036 --> 01:10:42.537
Well, they've both done great.

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.039
Times are different.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:46.675
We're shifting gears, so to speak,
keeping other options open,

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:48.944
and frankly we think
the sales on these cars

01:10:48.945 --> 01:10:51.179
- have reached their peak.
- Here we go.

01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:53.348
Look, I'm not saying that
we want to pull out altogether.

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:56.351
We'd like to stay on
as a secondary sponsor

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:58.054
for the next year or two.

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:04.803

but this is business.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.270

You're always bitching and moaning
to Spear about something.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:20.442
No wonder they're dropping us.

01:11:20.443 --> 01:11:23.078

once in a while, Tom...

- ...they wouldn't be so bored with us.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:24.285
Tom's 13-year-old son Jamie

01:15:24.286 --> 01:15:29.357
was diagnosed with acute leukemia
and is in serious condition.

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:33.695
With me now is Tom's friend

01:15:33.696 --> 01:15:37.532
and fellow racer, Don Prudhomme.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:41.613
Don, what can you tell us
about young Jamie's condition?

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:45.540
Uh, well, Mike, I...

01:15:45.541 --> 01:15:47.509
you're talking about
a real tough situation,

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:51.079
and, you know, we're all feeling
for Tom and Jamie,

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:52.981
the whole McEwen family, really.

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:57.719
Jamie is a real favorite for
all the racers on the circuit.

01:15:57.720 --> 01:16:00.822
MIKE: Thank you, Don.
So there you have it.

01:16:00.823 --> 01:16:04.025
The drag-racing community races on,

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:06.494
but its thoughts and its prayers

01:16:06.495 --> 01:16:10.665
go out to colleague,
rival, and friends

01:16:10.666 --> 01:16:13.039
Torn and Jamie McEwen.

01:16:14.270 --> 01:16:15.904
LYNN:
Have you spoken to Tom recently?

01:16:15.905 --> 01:16:18.773
DON: No. I tried him a few times.
No answer.

(MUSIC PLAYING OVER RADIO)

01:16:19.942 --> 01:16:23.344
I can't believe how long it's been
since we've seen them.

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.580
I sent the boys something
for Christmas.

01:16:25.581 --> 01:16:28.227
Oh, that's great.
I'm sure they'll love it.

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:33.999
It's got to be hard with Jamie in
and out of the hospital so much.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:37.192
Yeah.

- Hmm.

01:16:39.962 --> 01:16:41.763
You should try him tomorrow.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:43.637
You might be able to catch him.

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:46.234

- Hey there. How you doing?

01:16:52.475 --> 01:16:54.442
- How's it going, Wally?
- Good to see you back, Tom.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:56.478
- Hey, sonny. How you feeling?
- Good.

01:16:56.479 --> 01:16:58.913
- You guys know Paula.
- TOM: Hey.

01:16:58.914 --> 01:17:01.082
Someone told me
you're 'Goose's secret weapon.

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:03.751
Yeah, he's my best man on fuel.

01:17:03.752 --> 01:17:05.453
Taught him everything
he needs to know.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:08.490
Now we're going to kick
some butt, right, Dad?

01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:10.658
- That's right.
- WALLY: That's the spirit.

01:17:10.659 --> 01:17:12.794
All right, well, good luck.
Good luck to you both.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:13.962
- Thanks.
- Good to see you.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.430
Thank you.

01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:17.338
And watch out for snakes.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.473
Watch out for snakes.

01:17:22.605 --> 01:17:24.443
Hey.

01:17:25.441 --> 01:17:27.142
Now you got a fighting chance.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:29.310

- We're here to beat you, Snake.

01:17:29.311 --> 01:17:31.312
Yeah, yeah.

I see, huh?

01:17:34.483 --> 01:17:36.651
Yeah. Well, she's won
a couple races for me.

Yeah.

01:17:40.589 --> 01:17:43.825
Seems like the old times
are in our rearview.

01:17:43.826 --> 01:17:45.093
Nah.

01:17:45.094 --> 01:17:47.831
Wouldn't be so sure
about that, 'Goose. Come on.

01:17:48.631 --> 01:17:50.465

Yeah, you actually did it.

change, right?

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:19.163
TOM: Mm-hmm.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:22.363
My priority is to beat you
and everybody else here.

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:25.200
- All right.
- Okay, I'm going to go sit down.

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:26.534

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.431
Yeah.

01:19:30.432 --> 01:19:34.235
Maybe spending all day at the track
is a little bit too much for you.

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:37.605
No. I want to be here.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:40.141
I know.

Look, your mom...

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:46.289
thinks it might be a good idea for
you stay close to home for a while.

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:49.450
I do too.

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:51.460
But I want to be with you.

01:19:54.657 --> 01:19:57.292
Well, hey, I'm taking a break.

No, sirree.

I'll be fine.

No, can't do it.

01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:14.480
I'll get better faster.

Really?

It's that important to you?

and watch Snake win.

stay close to home no matter what.

begging me to go back.

he's doing good, that...

out for the SummerNats,

been beaten, though,
