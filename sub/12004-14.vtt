00:00.083 --> 00:01.530
<i>Previously...</i>

00:01.655 --> 00:05.180
- it was a kiss kiss.
- It is a giant conflict of interest.

00:05.305 --> 00:07.173
- Are you letting me go?
- I think we are, Amanda.

00:07.715 --> 00:09.942
I found out 12.5 years
ago when Daphne was three

00:10.301 --> 00:13.112
she wasn't biologically
related to me.

00:13.554 --> 00:16.047
All these people can write Books
about their lives. Why can't I?

00:16.432 --> 00:18.217
We're not together.
We're just friends.

00:18.768 --> 00:20.353
I don't wanna rent or buy a capybara.

00:20.420 --> 00:23.923
I wanna make a video that showcases
our music, not a giant rodent.

00:24.148 --> 00:26.192
The place I'm talking about
would be perfect for a salon.

00:26.692 --> 00:28.961
He tagged a billboard.
We take these crimes very seriously.

00:29.320 --> 00:32.131
And we are pressing charges.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:58.380 --> 03:01.282
Hey, uh, is there any way

03:01.349 --> 03:03.642
To get Emmett online when he's off?

03:04.286 --> 03:06.187
Not really. Why?

03:06.727 --> 03:08.289
( sighs ) He just texted me

03:08.356 --> 03:10.157
And now he's not picking up.

03:10.225 --> 03:13.160
- Was it about his motorcycle?
- Yeah.

03:13.228 --> 03:14.694
How did you know about--

03:15.297 --> 03:17.331
We were studying for trig together

03:17.399 --> 03:19.166
When he found out.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.336
I can't believe
he has to sell Ripley.

03:22.404 --> 03:24.255
I'm sorry. "Ripley"?

03:24.421 --> 03:26.873
It's what he calls his motorcycle,
after sigourney Weaver.

03:30.011 --> 03:31.711
From "Aliens," his favorite movie.

03:32.314 --> 03:36.314
We-- we mostly talk about art, so...

03:37.052 --> 03:39.678
Well, his dad bought it for
him for his 13th birthday.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.122
Oh well, see, that I knew.

03:42.190 --> 03:44.058
And they fixed it up together.

03:44.125 --> 03:46.193
So with the divorce
and his dad moving out,

03:46.261 --> 03:48.896
He cannot lose this bike.

03:48.964 --> 03:51.232
Something tells me you've
got a plan going on here.

03:51.299 --> 03:54.335
200 cupcakes at $5 each.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.937
It won't cover the whole thing,
but it's a start.

03:57.005 --> 03:59.006
All right,
one thing that I learned from Ty

03:59.074 --> 04:01.375
Is that guys really don't like you

04:01.443 --> 04:03.244
Offering them money
for their vehicle.

04:03.311 --> 04:05.146
It doesn't work out
the way you think it will.

04:05.213 --> 04:07.348
That's because you
were his girlfriend.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.917
And, plus, you're rich.

04:09.985 --> 04:11.986
Emmett won't mind taking it from me.

04:12.053 --> 04:13.320
But I'm kind of responsible.

04:13.388 --> 04:16.055
What are you talking about?

04:16.124 --> 04:18.926
Uh, the uh-- the billboard,

04:18.994 --> 04:22.196
The thing he did...

04:22.264 --> 04:25.065
Was for me.
It was a birthday present.

04:25.133 --> 04:26.808
I thought he gave you a scarf.

04:27.402 --> 04:30.237
I mean, that was the first part.

04:30.305 --> 04:33.207
I better get baking.

04:40.215 --> 04:41.916
It's good to see you both.

04:41.983 --> 04:43.317
It's been a long time
since you negotiated

04:43.385 --> 04:45.085
One of John's contracts.

04:45.153 --> 04:47.154
I should have brought
that mitt you said you'd sign.

04:47.222 --> 04:49.290
Bring it by any time, pal.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.892
Warren,
thank you so much for dropping by.

04:51.960 --> 04:53.360
I know litigation
isn't your specialty.

04:53.428 --> 04:55.896
Well, I'm happy to do what I can.

04:55.964 --> 04:57.932
Your files are pretty
straightforward.

04:57.999 --> 04:59.233
Maybe a few bad facts in here,

04:59.301 --> 05:01.902
But nothing that should keep us
from pressing for a settlement.

05:01.970 --> 05:04.371
Well, see, that's the thing.
The hospital withdrew their offers.

05:04.439 --> 05:06.307
- Mm.
- They're telling us they would like to go to trial.

05:06.374 --> 05:09.109
Oh, saber-rattling.
No one likes the expense of a trial.

05:09.177 --> 05:12.913
- They'll avoid it if they can.
- I'm writing a memoir about our experience.

05:12.981 --> 05:15.082
And our last lawyer
seemed a bit uncertain.

05:15.150 --> 05:17.885
No, I'd say keep all your notes
and drafts in one place

05:17.953 --> 05:20.154
And don't write anything you
wouldn't want read in open court.

05:20.222 --> 05:23.023
- All of it will be discoverable.
- That doesn't sound good.

05:23.091 --> 05:26.026
Are you kidding? A memoir's great!

05:26.094 --> 05:28.896
Powerful,
moving testimony with killer details.

05:29.370 --> 05:32.967
A jury will eat that up.
And hello movie rights!

05:33.034 --> 05:36.036
- Do you have a publisher yet?
- Oh, no.

05:36.104 --> 05:38.139
- Not yet. I'm-- I'm still writing it.
- Yeah.

05:38.206 --> 05:40.374
Um, excuse me just one second.
You mentioned a jury.

05:40.442 --> 05:41.967
So you would like to go to trial?

05:42.444 --> 05:46.280
I'm not gunning for it,
but if they call our bluff,

05:46.348 --> 05:49.116
We wanna show 'em we're ready to
get in there and annihilate them.

05:49.184 --> 05:52.219
You know what I'm talking about,
get our game face on.

05:52.287 --> 05:56.891
Yeah. Um, Craig,
on this record of settlements here

05:56.958 --> 05:59.059
How many of these did
you personally argue?

05:59.127 --> 06:03.164
Well, none in actuality,

06:03.231 --> 06:06.033
But I wrote most of them
and my father Was first chair,

06:06.225 --> 06:07.325
So I learned at the feet of a master.

06:07.748 --> 06:09.883
Great. Okay. Thank you so much.

06:09.950 --> 06:12.986
Um, well, we have tons to talk about.

06:13.053 --> 06:15.166
Absolutely. And, listen,

06:15.656 --> 06:17.924
I might look like a rookie,

06:17.992 --> 06:21.761
But that just means the other
side is not gonna see us coming.

06:21.829 --> 06:24.634
I'd love to work on this with you.

06:30.971 --> 06:34.707
Oh, let me guess. Buckner basketball?

06:34.775 --> 06:36.609
No, they're for Emmett.

06:36.677 --> 06:40.275
Oh, that motorcycle.
Melody feels sick about it.

06:40.714 --> 06:42.027
Support the cause?

06:44.785 --> 06:46.448
Breakfast of champions.

06:46.787 --> 06:49.789
Yes! Only 199 more to go.

06:49.857 --> 06:51.925
This is kind of fun.

06:51.992 --> 06:53.793
There's nothing like
running your own business.

06:53.861 --> 06:57.497
Um, actually, uh,

06:57.565 --> 06:59.966
I'm moving forward with Mine.

07:00.034 --> 07:01.935
- Do you mean the salon?
- Uh-huh.

07:02.002 --> 07:04.537
I am looking for a place later today.

07:04.605 --> 07:06.506
That's amazing! You got the loan?

07:06.574 --> 07:10.574
No, but Angelo wanted to invest.

07:10.911 --> 07:13.308
Oh.

07:13.747 --> 07:16.516
He's just a silent partner.
No creative input.

07:16.584 --> 07:18.518
It's just an investment for him.

07:18.586 --> 07:20.523
You won't have to see him at all.

07:21.756 --> 07:24.524
Okay.

07:24.944 --> 07:26.960
But if you or bay are
uncomfortable with it,

07:27.027 --> 07:28.573
I won't move forward.

07:28.863 --> 07:31.731
Well,

07:31.799 --> 07:34.667
I don't want to be the reason
that you don't get the salon.

07:34.735 --> 07:36.372
It wouldn't be like that.

07:39.740 --> 07:43.379
I say go for it. The money has
to come from somewhere, right?

07:43.744 --> 07:46.746
Ah. Oh, okay.

07:49.016 --> 07:51.885
Here's to small businesses.

07:59.593 --> 08:02.762
Uh, you know, I could drive around

08:02.830 --> 08:06.236
And put these on motorcycles for you.

08:13.607 --> 08:16.371
I miss hanging out.

08:19.046 --> 08:20.708
Wish I was better at trig.

08:24.709 --> 08:28.174
Oh, what-- what is that?

08:31.792 --> 08:34.994
- "Hypocrite."
- Hi.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.196
Uh, if-- if there's anything

08:50.644 --> 08:53.947
That I can do to help Emmett

08:54.014 --> 08:56.916
Keep his bike--

08:59.744 --> 09:01.788
Right, which he is trying to do,

09:01.856 --> 09:05.253
But, uh,
maybe like a payment plan could work.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.727
Uh, it's a plan

09:07.795 --> 09:11.598
And you pay money

09:11.665 --> 09:14.387
Over, uh, time.

09:37.758 --> 09:40.455
And how much is 
Â  all this gonna cost?

09:40.828 --> 09:43.696
My Uncle's warehouse is free
as long as we show up after 5:00.

09:43.764 --> 09:46.766
And what about Emmett? Bay said something
about him being on lockdown or something.

09:46.834 --> 09:48.968
Oh, we'll shoot inserts on him later.
Check this out--

09:49.036 --> 09:51.805
Costumes for the capybara.

09:51.872 --> 09:53.840
Look at that tux.

09:53.908 --> 09:55.708
We're gonna get more hits
than that dramatic chipmunk!

09:55.776 --> 09:58.511
But people are actually gonna be
listening to the song though, right?

09:58.579 --> 09:59.846
- Oh Yeah, dude.
- Hey, guys.

09:59.914 --> 10:01.184
Oh, Simone. Awesome.

10:01.649 --> 10:03.683
Hey, you're in Mancolo's
digital media class, right?

10:03.751 --> 10:05.585
No, I will not shoot your sex tape.

10:05.653 --> 10:07.754
Actually, we're making a music video.

10:07.822 --> 10:09.756
Really? Well, that I might shoot.

10:09.824 --> 10:11.858
We just need some equipment,
like a camera.

10:11.926 --> 10:15.528
Wait, you got the tux for the capybara,
but you didn't get a camera?

10:15.596 --> 10:17.617
I can set you guys up.
Who, uh-- who's directing?

10:17.865 --> 10:19.599
This is more of a d.I.Y. Thing.

10:19.667 --> 10:22.769
Dude, you guys should Totally
just focus on looking pretty.

10:22.837 --> 10:25.375
I have a project
that I've gotta do in this class anyway.

10:25.739 --> 10:28.975
I'll show up with the gear and do
the shooting and you guys be rock stars.

10:29.043 --> 10:31.644
- It's win-win.
- Our vision is pretty specific.

10:31.712 --> 10:34.547
But we do need
a director and a camera.

10:34.615 --> 10:35.949
You're hired.

10:36.016 --> 10:38.585
Okay.

10:38.652 --> 10:41.516
- Bye.
- See you.

10:43.758 --> 10:45.859
When are you gonna
give me a Peek at that?

10:45.926 --> 10:47.694
Mm, when it's ready.

10:47.762 --> 10:50.964
- "My husband is my hero."
- Oh no.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.969
So, honey, what do you think of
that second lawyer, Craig tebbe?

10:56.036 --> 10:57.771
- I liked him.
- Of course you liked him.

10:57.838 --> 11:00.940
He practically ordered
an advance copy of your book.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.909
Yeah. Warren wasn't
trying to flatter you?

11:02.977 --> 11:05.678
"When are you gonna sign my mitt?"

11:05.746 --> 11:07.680
Warren's got a hell of
a lot more experience.

11:07.748 --> 11:10.545
With sports contracts.

11:10.818 --> 11:14.988
We need a negotiator, not
a first-timer looking to prove himself.

11:15.055 --> 11:16.990
I'll see you.

11:18.826 --> 11:21.180
( softly ) What's wrong
with first-timers?

11:21.662 --> 11:23.763
Hey, I said it was five bucks.

11:23.831 --> 11:26.733
I'm the one who's deaf, not you.

11:26.801 --> 11:28.568
Thank you.

11:28.636 --> 11:30.637
Everybody at Buckner thinks
they don't have to pay.

11:30.704 --> 11:32.605
It's called entitlement for a reason.

11:32.673 --> 11:34.707
Do you want one? I'm helping Emmett.

11:34.775 --> 11:38.778
- He needs $5,000.
- I'm not really into cupcakes.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.617
So I saw you switched
cooking partners.

11:41.882 --> 11:43.716
Did you get tired of
me doing all the work?

11:43.784 --> 11:46.539
Nah, I just figured Clover could
use some guidance. See you there.

11:46.821 --> 11:48.041
Hey.

11:50.791 --> 11:53.504
We're still friends, right?

11:53.794 --> 11:56.963
You know what?
I got a lot of friends.

11:57.031 --> 11:59.999
And so do you.

12:05.005 --> 12:07.060
Uh, hey.

12:07.608 --> 12:09.228
How'd the cupcake thing go?

12:09.710 --> 12:13.358
Turns out 200 cupcakes is a lot.

12:13.747 --> 12:17.550
I was just bringing
the leftovers to you guys.

12:17.618 --> 12:21.988
Know anybody who needs some
work done on their bike?

12:23.824 --> 12:27.205
This is ridiculous.
We're surrounded by money.

12:27.661 --> 12:30.697
I know. My mom could squeeze
five grand out of mission hills

12:30.765 --> 12:33.967
- In like 10 minutes.
- Can't we just ask them?

12:34.034 --> 12:36.770
I'm sorry. You wanna ask my parents

12:36.837 --> 12:40.510
To cough up five grand So
Emmett Can keep his motorcycle?

12:40.841 --> 12:42.976
What if I say that my car broke down?

12:43.043 --> 12:45.712
Then he'll take your not-broken car

12:45.780 --> 12:47.647
To this guy who curses in polish.

12:47.715 --> 12:49.649
And seriously you're
going with subterfuge?

12:49.717 --> 12:51.584
If you think the truth won't work.

12:51.652 --> 12:54.023
I'm just saying that there
might be other options.

12:54.588 --> 12:56.523
What if I say I need a new computer?

12:56.590 --> 12:58.569
Then they'll buy you a new computer.

12:59.927 --> 13:02.762
Okay, so it has to be
something expensive

13:02.830 --> 13:04.964
That they can't just buy for me.

13:05.032 --> 13:06.933
I mean, that's generally the idea.

13:07.001 --> 13:10.503
- But, you know, I'm also thinking Maybe--
- wait!

13:10.571 --> 13:11.999
I know what to ask for.

13:13.841 --> 13:16.045
I lost my hearing Aids.

13:16.577 --> 13:19.813
- Oh, sweetie.
- I took them out at this cafe to read

13:19.880 --> 13:22.816
And I must have just
left them on the table.

13:22.883 --> 13:26.055
I'm so sorry to bother you,
but it's gonna kill my mom.

13:26.587 --> 13:28.988
Stop. Don't even think about it.

13:29.056 --> 13:31.724
What are we talking?

13:31.792 --> 13:34.694
Well, insurance won't
pay for a second pair,

13:34.762 --> 13:37.066
So $5,000.

13:37.565 --> 13:39.444
Done.

13:39.767 --> 13:42.836
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, no, we're just happy

13:42.903 --> 13:44.771
- That you came to us.
- Yeah.

13:44.839 --> 13:46.940
So how do we do this?
Do I call the CLINIC or--

13:47.007 --> 13:50.844
No. Uh, the clinic knows me,
so if you call it in,

13:50.911 --> 13:53.541
My mom will know and she'll
find out that you guys--

13:53.848 --> 13:55.543
We get it.

13:55.816 --> 13:57.817
So check out to you?

14:01.956 --> 14:05.992
- Of course I'll-- I'll pay you back.
- Stop. It's okay.

14:06.994 --> 14:10.600
We just wanna take care of you.

14:12.900 --> 14:14.901
Thank you.

14:25.467 --> 14:27.334
Why do I feel so bad?

14:27.402 --> 14:29.203
It's the lying afterburn.

14:29.271 --> 14:30.745
But I barely had to say anything.

14:31.373 --> 14:33.374
It was like they couldn't
wait to write that check.

14:33.441 --> 14:37.244
- I probably could have asked for more.
- Okay, got it.

14:40.282 --> 14:42.349
Well,

14:42.417 --> 14:46.010
I guess we tell Emmett the good news.

14:46.521 --> 14:49.290
I already texted him.

14:49.357 --> 14:52.359
Congratulations.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.368
Okay, we're gonna need to call
a contractor for the plumbing

15:01.436 --> 15:03.204
And we should definitely
drop the Ceiling.

15:03.271 --> 15:04.472
Can we just celebrate
for just a minute?

15:04.539 --> 15:06.273
I mean, this is incredible, right?

15:06.498 --> 15:08.908
An incredible amount of work.

15:09.511 --> 15:13.511
But yes, Incredible.

15:14.282 --> 15:17.151
Here, sparkling apple Cider.

15:17.582 --> 15:20.287
Yeah.

15:20.355 --> 15:24.355
Thank you for all of this.

15:25.260 --> 15:28.229
Here's to ripping everything out

15:28.296 --> 15:30.431
And starting all over again.

15:33.268 --> 15:36.137
Mm. Ah.

15:36.204 --> 15:38.139
Mm.

15:38.206 --> 15:41.142
You still wear the necklace.

15:41.209 --> 15:43.110
Uh, yeah.

15:43.178 --> 15:44.445
I--

15:44.513 --> 15:47.114
I guess I was feeling
a little superstitious.

15:47.182 --> 15:48.449
I should make one for Daphne.

15:48.517 --> 15:52.353
Okay, um,
you still need to go slow with her.

15:52.420 --> 15:55.156
It's not like
she really said yes to this.

15:55.223 --> 15:58.058
It's more like she got
tired of saying no.

15:58.126 --> 16:02.263
But there's hope.
And that's all I need.

16:04.499 --> 16:06.392
I'm sorry.

16:08.270 --> 16:10.437
It's the realtor. Um, I hope

16:10.719 --> 16:12.473
- The check didn't bounce.
- What?

16:12.541 --> 16:13.973
Kidding. Hello?

16:14.509 --> 16:17.244
You're so bad.

16:24.252 --> 16:26.120
Okay, I'll do
the thing with the tutu,

16:26.327 --> 16:28.055
But I'm not sticking
an orange in its mouth.

16:28.123 --> 16:29.423
Oh, come on,
it's the death of the godfather.

16:30.030 --> 16:33.491
I looked it up. Capybaras only eat,
like, four to six plant species.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.768
- I'm not feeding it random fruit.
- Oh, yeah?

16:35.836 --> 16:37.703
Well, they also eat their own poop.

16:37.771 --> 16:40.673
You just got out-Wikipedia'D. Boom!

16:42.809 --> 16:46.612
Clearly This is gonna require Sugar.

16:46.680 --> 16:49.548
Thanks for going with the whole concept.
I know it's--

16:49.616 --> 16:52.585
A total joke that has
nothing to do with your song?

16:52.653 --> 16:56.474
- I was gonna say "Elaborate," but--
- licorice?

16:57.858 --> 16:59.759
Mm.

16:59.826 --> 17:01.827
So doing famous film
scenes with a capybara--

17:01.895 --> 17:04.630
Whose stroke of Genius was that?

17:04.698 --> 17:07.800
Well, Wilke's the visionary.
I just write the songs.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.868
Yeah, youÂ  justÂ   write the songs.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.490
What?

17:12.739 --> 17:16.576
Justin Timberlake and Joey
fatone-- That's all I'm saying.

17:16.643 --> 17:19.612
( laughs ) I don't know
who I'd be in that equation.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.683
You know, sexy back.

17:26.653 --> 17:28.381
Okay.

17:30.966 --> 17:33.768
Well, thanks for following up.

17:33.836 --> 17:36.671
I'll let you know what
our next move is. Yeah.

17:36.739 --> 17:38.840
- ( clears throat, hangs up )
- You didn't just hire Warren, did you?

17:38.908 --> 17:41.519
No, that's the guy we had
checking up on Angelo.

17:41.844 --> 17:44.979
- Don't you wanna sit down?
- No. Virginia Woolf wrote standing up.

17:45.047 --> 17:48.550
- Mm.
- Did he find anything?

17:48.859 --> 17:51.953
Nothing.Â  It's like the guy
totally disappeared two years ago.

17:52.021 --> 17:53.822
Why don't you just ask Angelo?

17:53.889 --> 17:56.891
( huffs ) why?
He's just gonna spin some answer.

17:56.959 --> 18:00.204
It's worth a shot.
Every falsehood reveals a deeper truth.

18:00.730 --> 18:03.207
- Virginia Woolf?
- Kathryn Kennish.

18:03.733 --> 18:07.712
Coming soon to a bookstore near you.

18:12.942 --> 18:15.043
- There you are.
- Hey-- uh,

18:15.111 --> 18:17.722
Just grabbing my books.
I'ma go study at Emmett's.

18:18.047 --> 18:19.864
Oh, uh--

18:20.030 --> 18:23.982
I wanted to ask you about
that text you sent me.

18:24.754 --> 18:26.021
"Ripley saved"?

18:26.088 --> 18:30.088
- I sent that to you?
- Well, who was it for?

18:30.626 --> 18:33.487
Uh, somebody at school.

18:33.961 --> 18:35.997
It's just a project we're
working on together.

18:36.065 --> 18:39.201
It's just a joke.

18:39.668 --> 18:43.456
Wait, Ripley-- Emmett's motorcycle.

18:43.806 --> 18:47.042
It's not. It's-- it's
a project that we're working on.

18:47.109 --> 18:49.911
You're lying. Tell me right now.

18:49.979 --> 18:51.756
What's going on?

18:53.749 --> 18:56.651
I got some money

18:56.719 --> 18:58.820
So Emmett wouldn't have
to sell his motorcycle

18:58.888 --> 19:00.598
And I just wanted to let him know.

19:00.988 --> 19:02.691
Well, why couldn't
you just tell me that?

19:02.758 --> 19:04.435
I don't know. 'cause--

19:04.794 --> 19:08.663
Because...

19:08.731 --> 19:11.933
I got the money from
John and Kathryn.

19:12.001 --> 19:14.769
To pay for Emmett's motorcycle,

19:14.837 --> 19:17.490
The one-way ticket to
the emergency room? Try Again.

19:19.008 --> 19:22.977
Well, that's not what

19:23.045 --> 19:25.947
They thought they were paying for.

19:26.015 --> 19:30.015
I see. And what did they think
they were paying for?

19:31.018 --> 19:32.922
Something I'm too poor to give you?

19:33.989 --> 19:36.649
I told them

19:36.815 --> 19:38.135
That I lost my hearing aids.

19:38.627 --> 19:40.962
- You what?!
- I know.

19:41.030 --> 19:45.030
You are going over there
and tell them what you didÂ  now.

19:46.001 --> 19:48.187
And obviously you are
giving that money back!

19:52.842 --> 19:54.360
Now!

20:11.831 --> 20:13.832
Hi.

20:15.401 --> 20:16.668
- Hi.
- Is John home?

20:17.007 --> 20:18.804
Oh no, you just missed him.

20:18.871 --> 20:20.806
Did you get the new hearing aids?

20:20.873 --> 20:23.709
No. Actually, I just, uh, came by

20:23.972 --> 20:27.713
To give you this back.
I cashed the check.

20:27.780 --> 20:30.515
Is everything okay?

20:30.583 --> 20:34.453
Yeah. I-- I found my hearing aids.

20:34.774 --> 20:36.822
Oh, that's great!
Where did you find them?

20:38.858 --> 20:40.281
I, uh--

20:45.531 --> 20:47.332
I never lost them.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.568
I said that

20:49.636 --> 20:53.672
Because Emmett is going to
have to sell his motorcycle

20:53.740 --> 20:55.774
To pay for this fine that he owes

20:55.842 --> 20:59.811
And I knew that you would
never help out with that, so--

20:59.879 --> 21:01.580
So you lied to us?

21:01.648 --> 21:03.515
- I'm so sorry.
- Why?

21:03.583 --> 21:05.517
Why would you do that?

21:05.585 --> 21:08.720
It's just his motorcycle
is so important to him.

21:08.788 --> 21:11.657
And I wanted to be
the one to save him

21:11.724 --> 21:13.759
After all the times that he saved me.

21:13.826 --> 21:18.430
- So you thought that that made it okay?
- No.

21:18.498 --> 21:21.667
We wanted to help you

21:21.734 --> 21:24.503
And you used us like an a.T.M.

21:24.570 --> 21:27.372
I didn't mean to.

21:27.440 --> 21:30.709
I really am so sorry.

21:30.777 --> 21:32.678
I thought I could trust you.

21:32.745 --> 21:36.415
You can. I promise you can.

21:38.818 --> 21:40.507
Kathryn: 
Look, I know we agreed not to co-parent,

21:40.632 --> 21:43.568
But I just-- I had to take
away her car keys for a month.

21:43.635 --> 21:46.571
Believe me, if you hadn't,
I would have.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.540
Has she ever done
anything like this before?

21:49.608 --> 21:51.476
No, but then again

21:51.543 --> 21:54.712
She's never been around people who can
write her a check for $5,000 before

21:54.780 --> 21:56.948
- Without telling her mother.
- I'm sorry.

21:57.015 --> 21:59.750
We were just trying to help.
And obviously if we had known that--

21:59.818 --> 22:04.555
I know. It's no surprise
that she went off the rails.

22:04.623 --> 22:06.724
- Everything has been so crazy for her lately.
- I know, but I thought

22:06.792 --> 22:09.694
Things were getting better.
She was on that new basketball team

22:09.761 --> 22:11.863
And she's making new Friends.

22:12.247 --> 22:13.865
It's Angelo.

22:14.290 --> 22:15.933
What?

22:16.001 --> 22:17.935
He's helping me get
the salon started.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.638
And Daphne said she was fine with it,
but I don't know.

22:20.880 --> 22:22.740
You're opening up
a business together?

22:23.007 --> 22:26.644
Trying to build some financial
independence for myself, yes.

22:26.712 --> 22:28.913
I know, but with Angelo?

22:29.389 --> 22:31.816
If I had other options,
I'd be using them.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.851
As John Well knows,
no one does it alone.

22:34.310 --> 22:37.356
I know that too.

22:38.982 --> 22:40.591
I better go.

22:50.836 --> 22:53.604
Oh, honey,
I need to talk to you a minute.

22:53.672 --> 22:55.606
Yeah, I'm kind of
in a hurry actually.

22:55.674 --> 22:56.941
Is there some place you need to be?

22:57.500 --> 22:59.644
I'm trying to steal a few
illegal moments with Emmett.

22:59.711 --> 23:03.581
- Do you wanna arrest me?
- Actually, that's part of what I need to talk to you about.

23:03.649 --> 23:06.617
- What did I do?
- I don't know.

23:06.685 --> 23:08.820
See, Daphne came to us with a story

23:08.887 --> 23:10.655
About how she lost her hearing aids

23:10.722 --> 23:13.558
And she managed to
get $5,000 from us,

23:13.625 --> 23:15.743
And now I find out
that she made up the whole story

23:16.269 --> 23:18.896
So that Emmett wouldn't
have to sell his motorcycle.

23:19.314 --> 23:22.700
Still waiting for the part
where I did something.

23:22.942 --> 23:26.637
Well, I know that Emmett
is Daphne's friend,

23:26.705 --> 23:28.473
But he's your boyfriend--

23:28.540 --> 23:30.708
So automatically I must
have put her up to it?

23:30.950 --> 23:33.578
So you're telling me

23:33.645 --> 23:35.646
That Daphne thought up this
whole thing by herself?

23:35.714 --> 23:38.516
I don't believe this. Mom, this
would not hold up in a court of law.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.918
Actually, a court of law would
talk about your past offenses

23:40.986 --> 23:42.920
And the fact
that Daphne doesn't have any.

23:43.379 --> 23:45.656
Because you just met her.
And I hate to burst your bubble,

23:45.724 --> 23:48.559
- But she came to me and I tried to talk her out of it.
- Wait Wait.

23:48.627 --> 23:51.562
She came to you and you
didn't say anything to us?

23:51.630 --> 23:52.897
Do you even hear yourself?

23:52.965 --> 23:54.832
It's like no matter what I say,
this is my fault!

23:54.900 --> 23:57.502
I am just trying to
figure out what happened.

23:57.569 --> 24:00.705
What happened is she's not
the person that you think she is

24:00.773 --> 24:03.666
And if you're wrong about her,
then you might be wrong about me too.

24:12.885 --> 24:14.343
- John.
- Hey.

24:14.553 --> 24:16.721
- Can I, uh--
- oh sure, please come in.

24:16.789 --> 24:19.557
Thanks.

24:20.626 --> 24:21.826
Do you want me to make you a coffee.

24:21.894 --> 24:25.763
Uh, no no, thank you.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.600
I didn't know you did crafts.

24:29.668 --> 24:31.769
Yeah, I'm-- I'm working
on a necklace for Daphne.

24:31.837 --> 24:35.447
Oh, I'm realizing there's still
so much we don't know about you.

24:35.641 --> 24:38.476
I doubt any of it
is very interesting.

24:38.544 --> 24:39.911
I don't know.
I think it's pretty interesting

24:39.978 --> 24:42.980
There's no record of you
existing for the last two years.

24:47.619 --> 24:49.654
Well, if you asked me,
I would be happy to fill you in.

24:49.721 --> 24:51.722
I'm asking.

24:52.791 --> 24:55.726
Well, uh, after I left Regina,

24:55.794 --> 24:57.829
I traveled around,

24:57.896 --> 25:01.566
Uh, did different temporary jobs.

25:01.633 --> 25:03.293
Most of them paid Cash.

25:03.569 --> 25:06.771
Yeah, you know, I'm really more
interested in the last two years.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.809
But I had a situation in chicago,

25:11.877 --> 25:15.780
More like an arrangement
with a woman.

25:16.055 --> 25:18.783
She was well-off. We lived together.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.918
She took care of Things.

25:22.588 --> 25:24.689
Sorry. I just, you know,

25:24.756 --> 25:26.524
Think we're all a little on edge

25:26.592 --> 25:30.592
Since the whole Regina revelation.

25:31.279 --> 25:32.597
Sorry, what do you mean?

25:32.664 --> 25:35.600
Well, you know, the fact that she knew
about the switch all along.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.703
What? I don't understand.

25:40.606 --> 25:42.740
She did a D.N.A. Test on Daphne

25:42.808 --> 25:45.643
When Daphne was three.

25:45.711 --> 25:47.779
She's known she had
the WRONG kid for 13 years.

25:50.816 --> 25:52.884
I am sorry. I assumed you knew.

25:59.777 --> 26:02.832
But I just don't understand why
she didn't tell Angelo she knew.

26:02.957 --> 26:04.290
It just doesn't make any sense.

26:04.358 --> 26:07.160
( laughs ) honey, I can't begin to
tell you what Regina is thinking.

26:07.227 --> 26:09.329
Just when I think I have
one question answered, she--

26:09.396 --> 26:13.900
Yeah. Well, here's another
thing she forgot to mention--

26:13.968 --> 26:16.118
She and Angelo are opening
up a salon together.

26:16.284 --> 26:19.005
Oh, you mean the man she doesn't
trust to be anywhere near Daphne?

26:19.073 --> 26:20.996
- I know.
- No wonder the Kid's acting out.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.042
Let's not make excuses for Daphne.

26:23.110 --> 26:25.011
She lied to us for a motorcycle.

26:25.079 --> 26:28.314
- I'm just glad that thing is finally out of our lives.
- I am too.

26:30.250 --> 26:33.675
So should we be thinking
about a punishment or--

26:34.054 --> 26:36.428
I already took away her
car keys for a month.

26:36.957 --> 26:39.125
- Really?
- Yeah.

26:39.193 --> 26:41.961
Then I accused bay of
putting Daphne up to it.

26:42.029 --> 26:43.963
Now she hates me too.

26:44.031 --> 26:45.965
No, she doesn't hate you.

26:46.604 --> 26:48.232
You did the right thing.

26:49.937 --> 26:52.972
It doesn't feel that way.

26:53.040 --> 26:55.174
Let me tell you something,

26:55.242 --> 26:58.878
We're giving those kids exactly
what they need right now--

26:58.946 --> 27:00.947
A safe predictable world

27:01.015 --> 27:02.746
Where actions have consequences.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.951
You accidentally texted your mom?!

27:05.019 --> 27:06.252
How do you even do that?

27:06.320 --> 27:09.222
I don't know. Her number is
next to Emmett's in my phone.

27:09.290 --> 27:11.131
I felt bad.
Maybe I wanted to get caught.

27:11.358 --> 27:13.092
Oh. Next time you and your conscience

27:13.160 --> 27:15.128
Really need to get on the same page.

27:15.195 --> 27:17.130
At least I'm trying to help.

27:17.197 --> 27:19.899
Emmett wouldn't even be in
this mess if it wasn't for you!

27:19.967 --> 27:23.169
Really? You too? Could you
please please explain to me how

27:23.237 --> 27:26.005
I'm responsible for things I had 
nothingÂ  to do with?

27:26.073 --> 27:27.874
Emmett's given me a lot of gifts.

27:27.941 --> 27:29.648
None of them ever landed him in jail!

27:30.044 --> 27:31.944
Oh okay, now we're getting to it.

27:32.012 --> 27:34.213
You're pissed because all you
got a dvd for your birthday

27:34.281 --> 27:37.489
- And I got a romantic gesture--
- that got him arrested.

27:37.951 --> 27:39.319
And now he's about to lose the thing

27:39.386 --> 27:41.321
He cares about the most.
Thank you, bay!

27:41.388 --> 27:43.829
Okay, hang on a second, all right?
Just wait.

27:44.124 --> 27:47.624
This is stupid.
And none of it is helping Emmett.

27:47.995 --> 27:49.896
This is a disaster.

27:49.964 --> 27:52.671
And John and Kathryn think
I'm a thief and a liar.

27:53.033 --> 27:55.368
Actually they think I cornered
the market on that one.

27:57.071 --> 27:59.005
Forget it, okay? I have a plan.

27:59.073 --> 28:00.429
Are you kidding me?

28:00.941 --> 28:03.209
Who do we know with enough money

28:03.277 --> 28:06.602
To blow on a giant rodent who also
happens to have a huge crush on you?

28:07.047 --> 28:10.605
No way. Wilke wouldn't even
buy a cupcake to help Emmett.

28:11.051 --> 28:13.086
Don't underestimate your charm,
all right?

28:13.153 --> 28:14.860
It's all about how you frame it.

28:15.278 --> 28:18.091
I lied to your parents, my mom,

28:18.158 --> 28:20.126
And I'm not gonna
manipulate Wilke too.

28:20.194 --> 28:23.229
Is now really a good time to be
taking the moral high ground?

28:24.365 --> 28:26.332
I couldn't even do it
even if I wanted to.

28:26.400 --> 28:29.624
- Your mom took my keys.
- She did?!

28:31.080 --> 28:33.381
Could you try to keep
the happiness down a little bit?

28:33.449 --> 28:35.383
Even I can hear you.

28:35.451 --> 28:37.517
Okay.
I'll drive.

28:44.639 --> 28:46.807
Don't yell at me, it's not my fault
that the stupid rodent isn't here!

28:46.874 --> 28:49.576
It's on its way. So can we just
set up the shot like we planned?

28:49.644 --> 28:50.835
Simone, what are you doing here?

28:51.001 --> 28:52.980
-Â  ( guitar playing )Â
- Directing Supposedly.

28:53.047 --> 28:54.524
Look, I just wanna shoot

28:55.088 --> 28:57.818
- Something that involves the actual band.
- There is a plan here.

28:57.885 --> 28:59.988
Your plan is stupid and has
nothing to do with the music!

29:00.279 --> 29:01.989
- What's going on?
- Toby!

29:02.448 --> 29:04.725
Oh, hey.

29:04.992 --> 29:07.961
Okay, I hate to interrupt
the pandemonium,

29:08.029 --> 29:12.099
But we actually came
here for a purpose, so...

29:17.939 --> 29:21.575
I know how you guys
feel about Emmett.

29:21.643 --> 29:23.043
- What? I like Emmett.
- He's your drummer

29:23.111 --> 29:25.045
And you're shooting
a music video without him.

29:25.113 --> 29:26.813
- Thank you.
- We'll do inserts.

29:26.881 --> 29:28.815
- He said we're gonna shoot inserts!
- Guys, Stop.

29:28.883 --> 29:32.786
Okay, when you guys lost
your drummer at the Buckner fund raiser,

29:32.854 --> 29:35.232
Who was there to save your Butts?
Emmett.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.958
And when you were trying
to get into east-west Fest,

29:38.026 --> 29:39.826
Who was there to
exploit for a gimmick?

29:39.894 --> 29:41.636
- He wanted to be there.
- We didn't exploit Emmett.

29:41.802 --> 29:45.723
Okay, the point is,
Emmett has been there to help you out.

29:45.967 --> 29:50.771
- He's your bandmate. He's my best friend.
- He's my boyfriend.

29:50.838 --> 29:52.906
- And he's going through a lot right now.
- Just spit it out.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.677
- What do you need?
- Five grand by tomorrow

29:56.744 --> 29:58.645
- Or he has to sell his motorcycle.
- Five grand?!

29:58.713 --> 30:00.914
- You serious?
- Five grand?! We don't have five grand.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.583
You don't have five grand?
I'm sorry, what is all of this?

30:03.651 --> 30:06.920
- Exactly. We spent it all.
- You spent it all on what,

30:06.988 --> 30:08.955
Green paint and a tarp?

30:11.976 --> 30:14.995
What about your fake I.D. Business?

30:15.521 --> 30:17.831
Look, if I had the money,
I would give it to you.

30:20.443 --> 30:22.636
You're killing me here.

30:22.704 --> 30:25.739
It's just-- you were my last hope.

30:25.807 --> 30:27.908
All I can say is,
no matter what happens to the bike,

30:27.975 --> 30:30.744
That guy's a lucky bastard. And hey,

30:30.812 --> 30:32.746
If it helps,

30:32.978 --> 30:34.982
I know what you're going through.

30:35.049 --> 30:37.884
It's no fun going after
something you're never gonna get.

30:40.054 --> 30:42.022
At some point you gotta
give up the ghost.

30:48.863 --> 30:50.864
- Angelo, look--
- don't tell me I'm not following the rules

30:51.079 --> 30:53.567
Because I don't care right now.

30:53.634 --> 30:54.523
What are you doing here?

30:54.648 --> 30:56.513
How long have you known
Daphne wasn't your daughter?

30:56.638 --> 30:59.940
- I-- uh--
- You knew all this time and you didn't tell me?

31:00.441 --> 31:03.744
I came back 13 years later,
begging for Everyone's forgiveness

31:03.811 --> 31:04.978
And you still don't tell me?

31:06.378 --> 31:09.128
- I was getting to it. I'm sorry.
- I don't think you were.

31:09.862 --> 31:11.796
Because that would mean

31:11.864 --> 31:13.998
That I was right
and that you couldn't stand.

31:14.066 --> 31:16.935
I did try. I called you in Italy

31:17.002 --> 31:18.837
- And some woman answered.
- So what?

31:18.904 --> 31:21.806
I had the right to know that my real
daughter was out there somewhere!

31:21.874 --> 31:23.123
What if I wanted to contact her?!

31:23.464 --> 31:26.911
I didn't want you to contact her!

31:26.979 --> 31:30.680
I was protecting her.
That's the choice I made--

31:30.916 --> 31:32.851
Not to interrupt the life she had,

31:32.918 --> 31:35.220
Not for you or me or anyone.

31:35.601 --> 31:38.122
That wasn't your choice to make.

31:38.479 --> 31:41.893
I know you don't understand.
 No one understands.

31:41.961 --> 31:43.568
I did it for the girls.

31:43.829 --> 31:46.965
You know what?
I'm done with everything.

31:47.032 --> 31:48.800
Of course you are!

31:49.365 --> 31:51.903
Typical Angelo-- walking out again!

32:11.135 --> 32:12.936
It's not like we totally failed.

32:13.004 --> 32:16.874
I mean,
we still have your cupcake money.

32:16.941 --> 32:18.728
I had to spend $20 on gas.

32:24.282 --> 32:28.151
( snickers ) I remember
the first time

32:28.219 --> 32:30.821
He took me out on the motorcycle.

32:30.889 --> 32:34.024
We went on that road that goes
all the way around the city,

32:34.092 --> 32:36.960
Going like 70 the whole time.

32:37.028 --> 32:40.130
And we were both just screaming
at the top of our lungs.

32:40.198 --> 32:44.201
And it was, like,

32:44.269 --> 32:47.838
For the first time
we didn't have to worry

32:48.215 --> 32:50.594
About what our voices sounded like.

33:29.147 --> 33:30.948
Hey.

33:31.015 --> 33:33.250
That was amazing.

33:33.318 --> 33:34.512
Thanks.

33:35.119 --> 33:37.807
How come I've never
heard that before?

33:38.122 --> 33:41.325
I guess it wasn't Timberlake enough.

33:43.228 --> 33:45.896
- You ready for me?
- Wilke's still in there

33:45.964 --> 33:47.798
Trying to get that thing into a tutu.

33:47.866 --> 33:50.100
what? It's Wilke.

33:50.168 --> 33:53.136
- You went out with him. You know the deal.
- Yeah, I know.

33:53.204 --> 33:56.273
I guess I just realized
I could do better.

33:57.484 --> 33:59.344
Well, I appreciate you doing this,

33:59.469 --> 34:01.536
But if you think we're a joke, then--

34:01.604 --> 34:05.574
The first time that I saw
you guys was freshman year

34:05.641 --> 34:08.810
In Valerie Marek's basement.

34:08.878 --> 34:11.413
You guys were a sloppy mess...

34:11.481 --> 34:13.514
...until this one song.

34:13.583 --> 34:15.516
It stopped the party cold.

34:16.712 --> 34:17.752
"Everybody's hero."

34:18.054 --> 34:22.524
And I remember thinking,
"wow, this guy is magic.

34:22.592 --> 34:25.860
He can stop time."

34:26.531 --> 34:30.434
I didn't just happen
to show up at east-west

34:30.502 --> 34:34.371
Because I wanted to see
a bunch of other bands play.

34:34.438 --> 34:35.949
I came to see you.

34:37.686 --> 34:40.721
I have been at
every single one of your shows

34:40.789 --> 34:42.556
Just waiting

34:42.623 --> 34:45.793
For that to happen again.

34:45.860 --> 34:49.830
That's why I did this.

34:50.050 --> 34:53.833
Well, that and--

35:16.625 --> 35:19.627
Uh, we've been doing
everything that we can

35:19.695 --> 35:22.063
To save Ripley.

35:25.767 --> 35:28.334
But we couldn't. I'm so sorry.

35:53.729 --> 35:56.897
Well, you guys go.
Mow down some aliens for me.

35:59.239 --> 36:01.535
You guys go ahead.

36:01.603 --> 36:02.937
It's okay.

36:04.773 --> 36:06.741
Really?

36:06.808 --> 36:09.375
Yeah.

36:16.852 --> 36:19.427
You should go to blue river Road.

36:19.848 --> 36:20.955
It's killer at night.

37:05.067 --> 37:08.205
So my mom just took away her car.

37:08.330 --> 37:10.356
I mean,
Kathryn kennish can throw down.

37:10.481 --> 37:13.868
People don't think it's there,
but it is.

37:15.337 --> 37:17.149
Yeah.

37:17.496 --> 37:20.446
I'm sorry that we couldn't save
your bike.

37:26.882 --> 37:28.983
Uh, no, you idiot. ( sighs )

37:29.051 --> 37:31.152
Because you built it with your Dad.

37:31.220 --> 37:34.856
And you named it after
some alien killer.

37:34.923 --> 37:36.190
It's a part of you.

37:36.628 --> 37:38.793
And now you're losing
it because of me.

37:38.861 --> 37:42.864
No, it's True.
If it wasn't for that stupid billboard.

38:04.953 --> 38:06.701
I know.

38:23.362 --> 38:25.063
So do I get to be
your new taxi service?

38:26.421 --> 38:28.097
Don't make me sorry I called you.

38:28.623 --> 38:31.558
What turned you around?
The video shoot?

38:31.626 --> 38:35.429
- Seeing me in my element?
- Maybe I felt sorry for you,

38:35.496 --> 38:37.564
Waiting around for
something you couldn't have.

38:37.632 --> 38:40.434
I'd say my patience paid off.

38:40.501 --> 38:43.637
The gazelle has returned
to the watering hole.

38:45.540 --> 38:47.116
You are incredible.

38:47.642 --> 38:50.310
I'm out of comebacks.
Can we make out now?

38:50.378 --> 38:51.996
Drive.

38:53.681 --> 38:56.250
- John, hi.
- Craig?

38:56.317 --> 38:58.352
- Did we have a--
- no no, I just was hoping

38:58.419 --> 39:00.117
- To drop these off for Kathryn.
- Oh, she--

39:00.242 --> 39:03.466
- Hi, Craig.
- Hey. Listen, I hope you don't mind,

39:03.591 --> 39:05.426
but I ran your book idea
past a Buddy of mine

39:05.894 --> 39:08.896
at a publishing house in Chicago
and he seems pretty interested.

39:08.963 --> 39:11.732
I thought I'd bring by
some of his other titles,

39:11.799 --> 39:12.933
show you what kinds
of things they do.

39:13.475 --> 39:15.469
Well, thank you so much.
That's thoughtful.

39:15.537 --> 39:17.771
Really giving it the old
full court press, huh, Craig?

39:17.839 --> 39:19.640
- I always do.
- You wanna come in?

39:19.707 --> 39:21.742
- Sure.
- Well, kath...

39:21.810 --> 39:24.745
Kathryn-- um, listen, Craig...

39:24.813 --> 39:26.814
in fairness, I--

39:26.881 --> 39:28.849
I think you should know we're leaning

39:28.917 --> 39:32.486
- in another direction--
- mm, I understand.

39:32.554 --> 39:34.700
- Can I ask who?
- Warren enfield.

39:34.866 --> 39:37.870
Oh, sure. That makes sense.
Warren's a great negotiator.

39:38.036 --> 39:41.495
If you're looking to make a deal,
you can't do better.

39:41.563 --> 39:44.665
But if you wanna Sue this hospital
for their egregious mistakes

39:44.732 --> 39:47.501
and total dysfunction
as an organization,

39:47.569 --> 39:50.604
- I'd say I'm your guy.
- And Why's that?

39:50.888 --> 39:53.474
Because I don't want some settlement
check that comes out of an account

39:53.541 --> 39:55.709
they set aside to pay for
their mistakes and keep people quiet.

39:56.059 --> 39:58.579
In my experience,
money buries the truth.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.682
What gets things to actually
change is noise. That's me.

40:01.749 --> 40:04.618
I'm noisy.

40:04.902 --> 40:06.720
I'm not saying this
is a bulletproof case,

40:06.788 --> 40:09.590
but I look through your files
and all I see is negligence

40:09.657 --> 40:11.592
and abuse of labor laws,

40:11.659 --> 40:13.894
not to mention
the unconscionable unwillingness

40:13.962 --> 40:18.732
to take responsibility for
what they did to two Families.

40:20.886 --> 40:22.666
Obviously we can't
undo what they did,

40:22.791 --> 40:25.362
but we  can hold
their feet to the fire.

40:25.993 --> 40:29.662
You can find somebody
more experienced,

40:29.730 --> 40:33.199
but you're not gonna find somebody
as committed or as pissed off as I am.

40:35.903 --> 40:39.038
Okay, Craig tebbe.
Let's make some noise.

40:39.394 --> 40:41.040
All right.

41:44.738 --> 41:46.005
I didn't know you were here.

41:46.073 --> 41:49.809
I was, uh, clearing out the back--

41:49.877 --> 41:51.878
I just wanted to drop off the key.

41:51.945 --> 41:54.147
I spoke to the realtor.
They said that they would let us out

41:54.214 --> 41:56.049
if we paid one month's rent,
which obviously I will cover.

41:56.430 --> 41:58.751
- You don't have to.
- No, I insist.

41:58.819 --> 42:01.054
I don't wanna cancel the lease.

42:01.391 --> 42:02.998
I don't what I wanna do.

42:03.123 --> 42:05.892
This was supposed to be it, you know?

42:06.440 --> 42:07.927
This was supposed to be

42:07.995 --> 42:11.097
me finally getting everything right.

42:11.165 --> 42:15.101
Yeah, I don't think that's possible.

42:15.169 --> 42:17.937
I was up all night thinking.

42:18.005 --> 42:22.005
The truth is if I were you,

42:22.209 --> 42:25.459
I don't know what I would have done.

42:25.746 --> 42:29.746
You believe me?
That I did what I did for the girls?

42:30.951 --> 42:34.552
Yes, I believe you.

42:38.993 --> 42:42.061
I was going to bring this by later.

42:42.129 --> 42:45.832
It's for Daphne.

42:47.167 --> 42:50.837
I don't wanna disappear.

42:50.904 --> 42:53.906
I've already missed out on so much.

42:55.109 --> 42:59.879
I'm not missing out any more.

42:59.947 --> 43:03.116
I'm sorry. It's just that--

43:03.183 --> 43:04.582
no one has understood

43:05.152 --> 43:09.922
why I did what I did.

43:09.990 --> 43:11.958
Gina.

43:12.305 --> 43:18.282
