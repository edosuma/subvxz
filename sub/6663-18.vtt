Adult adam:
<i>It's a funny thing</i>
<i>about dads...</i>

00:03.671 --> 00:06.805
<i>They always tend to be</i>
<i>creatures of habit.</i>

00:06.807 --> 00:08.707
<i>At least, my father was.</i>

00:08.709 --> 00:11.143
<i>He liked what he liked,</i>
<i>and he hated change.</i>

00:11.145 --> 00:14.913
<i>Ever since I can remember,</i>
<i>he wore the same shoes,</i>

00:14.915 --> 00:17.616
<i>He ate the same breakfast.</i>
<i>(crunching)</i>

00:17.684 --> 00:18.984
I'm home!

00:18.986 --> 00:20.019
Don't anybody bother me!

00:20.021 --> 00:22.087
<i>And every day,</i>
<i>he'd come home at 5:15,</i>

00:22.089 --> 00:25.090
<i>Park his pants at the door,</i>
<i>sit in the same chair,</i>

00:25.092 --> 00:27.359
<i>And watch the same show.</i>
<i>(tv turns on)</i>

00:27.361 --> 00:29.161
<i>If you tried</i>
<i>to change anything,</i>

00:29.163 --> 00:30.295
<i>He'd fight you</i>
<i>tooth and nail.</i>

00:30.297 --> 00:31.964
<i>That's why my mom</i>
<i>created the illusion</i>

00:31.966 --> 00:34.833
<i>Everything stayed the same,</i>
<i>but it wasn't.</i>

00:34.835 --> 00:37.469
<i>That magical pair of shoes</i>
<i>that never wore out...</i>

00:37.471 --> 00:40.172
<i>She secretly replaced them</i>
<i>every eight months.</i>

00:40.174 --> 00:43.842
<i>That laissez-faire</i>
<i>attitude about</i>
<i>his personal grooming...</i>

00:43.844 --> 00:45.744
<i>She tended to that, too.</i>

00:45.746 --> 00:46.645
<i>She even managed</i>
<i>to switch him</i>

00:46.647 --> 00:49.314
<i>To low-fat cream cheese</i>
<i>without him noticing.</i>

00:49.316 --> 00:50.349
This tastes funny.

00:50.351 --> 00:51.250
No, it doesn't.
Okay.

00:51.252 --> 00:55.320
<i>Yep, beverly goldberg</i>
<i>had always been</i>
<i>the puppet master,</i>

00:55.322 --> 00:57.823
<i>And my dad had no idea.</i>

00:57.825 --> 00:58.624
Beverly!

00:58.626 --> 01:03.195
<i>That is, until the day</i>
<i>she got a new chair.</i>

01:03.630 --> 01:05.164
Beverly!
Beverly goldberg!

01:05.166 --> 01:09.368
What the hell is sitting
where my chair should be?

01:09.370 --> 01:10.969
Surprise! (chuckles)

01:10.971 --> 01:13.038
I thought it was time
for an upgrade.

01:13.040 --> 01:13.972
Don't you just love it?

01:13.974 --> 01:17.309
Where's my chair...
The one I've been sitting in
for 20 years?

01:17.311 --> 01:18.210
I donated it
to goodwill.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.812
Without telling me?
Why would you do that?

01:19.814 --> 01:23.382
Honey,
you're always complaining
about how your back hurts.

01:23.384 --> 01:24.716
It's that old chair.

01:24.718 --> 01:25.584
You never liked
that chair.

01:25.586 --> 01:28.387
You've always been jealous
of what we've had together.

01:28.389 --> 01:28.954
"we"? Who's "we"?

01:28.956 --> 01:31.957
Me and mr. Chair.
That's right, it had a name.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.659
Well, it's not
a very good one.

01:33.661 --> 01:34.893
Mine is top-of-the-line.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.729
You're gonna love
how comfy it is.

01:38.698 --> 01:41.066
(leather squishes)

01:41.501 --> 01:43.435
Oh. It's so spongy.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.337
Honey, you're gonna
have to trust me on this.

01:45.339 --> 01:47.239
I bought it
for your own good.

01:47.241 --> 01:49.641
I can't breathe.
Can't breathe.

01:49.643 --> 01:50.476
Well,
stop sitting like that.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.945
You're sitting uncomfortably
on purpose.

01:52.947 --> 01:54.313
It's engulfing me.

01:54.315 --> 01:54.913
Stop it!

01:54.915 --> 01:58.484
Those are exaggerated
body movements.

01:58.785 --> 01:59.785
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:59.787 --> 02:04.623

adult adam:  <i>It was March 7,</i>
<i>1980-something.</i>

02:13.200 --> 02:15.601
<i>And like every day,</i>
<i>I rode the bus.</i>

02:15.603 --> 02:17.236
<i>Back then,</i>
<i>this was the wild west...</i>

02:17.238 --> 02:19.371
<i>No seatbelts,</i>
<i>no security cameras,</i>

02:19.373 --> 02:23.609
<i>No one to stop the one dude</i>

02:23.611 --> 02:28.013
<i>For me, it was</i>

02:28.015 --> 02:30.916
Look who it is...
Adam gold-nerd.

02:30.918 --> 02:34.086
<i>He may have been tiny,</i>
<i>but he was terrible.</i>

02:34.088 --> 02:35.654
Can you please
lay off today, j.C.?

02:35.656 --> 02:38.991
I forgot my gym shorts and
had to run the mile in jeans.

02:38.993 --> 02:40.025
I have
a really bad chafe.

02:40.027 --> 02:43.495
Oh, man. I am so sorry
to hear that.

02:43.630 --> 02:44.596
Hey, everybody.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.365
Adam has got
some sting-y thighs.

02:46.367 --> 02:49.001
So if I see
one spitball hit this kid,

02:49.003 --> 02:50.302
You will have to deal
with me.

02:50.304 --> 02:53.138
Wow. Thanks, dude.
That's... That's really...

02:53.140 --> 02:55.707
(spits)
(laughter)

02:55.709 --> 02:59.111
Everybody get their asses
in their seats.

02:59.113 --> 03:00.812
Especially you, spink!

03:00.814 --> 03:02.447
Yes, sir.

03:02.449 --> 03:03.882
Mind if we share?

03:03.884 --> 03:05.083
(brakes hiss)

03:05.085 --> 03:07.819
<i>I was plastered</i>
<i>up against that window</i>
<i>for the next 20 minutes.</i>

03:07.821 --> 03:12.257
<i>And then I saw barry</i>
<i>doing what he did best...</i>
<i>Flipping out.</i>

03:12.259 --> 03:16.428
No! No! No, no, no!

03:16.430 --> 03:17.896
What the hell
is his deal?

03:17.898 --> 03:20.899
Where the hell is
my  <i>sports illustrated</i>
<i>football phone?</i>

03:20.901 --> 03:23.802
Damn it.
Where? Where? Where?

03:23.804 --> 03:24.736
Ow! (groans)

03:24.738 --> 03:26.205
Unreal! Unreal!
That's my big brother,
barry.

03:26.207 --> 03:29.074
He's clinically insane.
(groans)

03:29.076 --> 03:30.309
For real?

03:30.311 --> 03:32.077
The doctors
gave up on him.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.213
He's too crazy
for their modern medicine.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.348
(groans)
where is my phone?

03:36.350 --> 03:40.219
And if you don't back off,
I'm bringing him on this bus,

03:40.221 --> 03:43.155
And he'll smear you
against a window.

03:45.291 --> 03:46.425
<i>J.C. Was running scared.</i>

03:46.427 --> 03:47.726
<i>Now I just had to get barry</i>
<i>on board.</i>

03:47.728 --> 03:51.330
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>he was a little preoccupied</i>
<i>with more urgent matters.</i>

03:51.332 --> 03:57.236
The dude on tv said
my football phone would
be here in eight weeks.

03:57.238 --> 03:57.803
It's been 10!

03:57.805 --> 04:00.505
I mean, what am I
supposed to do, huh?

04:00.507 --> 04:02.774
Make phone calls
on a phone-shaped phone

04:02.776 --> 04:03.976
Like some kind
of animal?

04:03.978 --> 04:06.111
I say good day
to you, sir.

04:06.113 --> 04:06.812
(receiver slams)

04:06.814 --> 04:08.213
Rough stuff, man.
(sighs)

04:08.215 --> 04:11.516
I can see you're
going through a lot.

04:11.518 --> 04:12.384
Speaking of
difficult problems,

04:12.386 --> 04:13.719
Is there any way
you would start

04:13.721 --> 04:15.454
Riding the bus to school
with me again? Huh?

04:15.456 --> 04:16.455
Why would I ride the bus
with you

04:16.457 --> 04:18.890
When I carpool with erica and
her smoking-hot friend lainey

04:18.892 --> 04:22.027
Who secretly loves me but
is too afraid to act on it?

04:22.029 --> 04:22.527
(sighs) look.

04:22.529 --> 04:24.763
There's this kid
who's making my life hell.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.299
And if you were there,
he'd leave me alone.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.468
I do have an air
of badass about me.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.303
So you'll do it?
Hmm.

04:31.305 --> 04:32.504
I've given it
a lot of thought,

04:32.506 --> 04:35.874
And I'm respectfully declining
your stupid-ass invitation.

04:35.876 --> 04:36.608
Please! I'm begging you!

04:36.610 --> 04:38.143
I'll give you
all my garbage pail kids.

04:38.145 --> 04:41.246
See? They're like
baseball cards,
but hilarious.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.682
One day, these will be
worth millions.

04:43.684 --> 04:44.483
<i>They're not.</i>

04:44.485 --> 04:46.084
All right. Fine.
Whatever. I'm in.

04:46.086 --> 04:47.052
For real?
Listen, bro.

04:47.054 --> 04:49.821
You're literally
the most annoying,
un-athletic,

04:49.823 --> 04:52.891
Four-eyed, almost girl-like
dork I've ever met.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.728
But you're my brother,
and no one
beats you up but me.

04:56.730 --> 04:57.529
(chuckles)

04:57.531 --> 05:00.699
<i>I was touched, insulted,</i>
<i>and kind of angry,</i>

05:00.701 --> 05:03.769
<i>But I'd gotten</i>
<i>what I wanted.</i>

05:04.804 --> 05:05.437
No, stop!

05:05.439 --> 05:07.673
Once the chair
molds to your body,
there's no going back!

05:07.675 --> 05:10.442
It's imprinted to you
for life!
Wha?

05:10.444 --> 05:13.111
The first 48 hours
are the most important.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.946
Get up! Get up!

05:15.081 --> 05:16.548
Aw, damn it.

05:16.550 --> 05:19.284
Now it's got your
tiny girl imprint.

05:19.286 --> 05:22.220
This is truly the worst thing
to ever happen to me.

05:22.222 --> 05:26.558
Okay. I'm gonna leave you
to whatever this is.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.306
Magic.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.941
I'd buy that.
I agree.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.410
It's not magic,
people.

06:51.412 --> 06:53.779

07:22.009 --> 07:23.675
Are you sure
you want to take me on?

07:23.677 --> 07:25.744
Oh, I'm sure...

In honor of my fallen
comrade, mr. Chair.

07:30.917 --> 07:31.716

07:51.038 --> 07:53.538
Time for target practice.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.159
Dude, thank you.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.561
No problem.

08:49.563 --> 08:51.296
Now give me your lunch.

08:51.797 --> 08:55.166
Being awesome
makes me hungry.

08:55.735 --> 08:58.537
You're supposed to use
the spreader.

08:59.505 --> 09:00.205
Consider it used.

09:00.207 --> 09:04.075
<i>And just like that,</i>
<i>my new bodyguard</i>
<i>became my new bully.</i>

09:04.077 --> 09:09.614
<i>And at home,</i>
<i>my mom and dad's battle</i>
<i>had become a war.</i>

09:11.250 --> 09:17.289
<i>His tightie-whitie drawer</i>
<i>had been invaded by boxers.</i>

09:17.757 --> 09:19.257
Here you go, sweetie.

09:19.259 --> 09:23.194
Straight out of
the radioactive heat box.

09:23.196 --> 09:24.262
Oh.

09:24.264 --> 09:27.065
It's like eating
egg-flavored newspaper.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.400
All right,
we need to talk.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.937
Oh, morning, sweetie.
Would you like some
microwaved egg rubber?

09:31.939 --> 09:34.606
No. I would like
my underpants back.

09:34.608 --> 09:35.840
Oh, well,
you're holding them.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.108
No, no. These are
not my underpants.

09:37.110 --> 09:41.346
Mine are white, tight,
and they keep the fellas
in place.

09:41.348 --> 09:41.980
Not hungry.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.615
Well,
now you have boxers.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.317
You know,
scientific research shows

09:45.319 --> 09:47.218
That you need to let
your privates breathe,

09:47.220 --> 09:49.254
Especially if we're gonna
have more kids one day.

09:49.256 --> 09:53.024
First, I will never wear
shorts under my pants.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.025
It's madness!

09:54.027 --> 09:55.727
And second,
having more children

09:55.729 --> 09:58.964
Is literally
my worst nightmare!

09:59.832 --> 10:01.833
You'll understand
when you have horrible kids.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.869
Sweetie, I'm only doing
this for your own good.

10:05.237 --> 10:07.005
You want war?

10:07.007 --> 10:08.940
You got one.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.644
<i>My mom thought</i>
<i>she had struck</i>
<i>the death blow</i>

10:12.646 --> 10:14.913
<i>By taking away</i>
<i>my dad's tightie-whities.</i>

10:14.915 --> 10:18.984
<i>Little did she know,</i>
<i>things were about</i>
<i>to get ugly...</i>

10:18.986 --> 10:19.985
<i>Real ugly.</i>
<i>Well, well.</i>

10:19.987 --> 10:24.222
Look who finally came
around on the boxers.
Nope.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.191
But you're dressed
for work.
Yep.

10:26.193 --> 10:29.861
So everything's just
all free in there?
Yep.

10:29.863 --> 10:31.062
No!

10:31.064 --> 10:33.064
You're an adult man
in society.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.666
You need another layer!

10:34.668 --> 10:37.302
People won't see it,
but they'll sense it.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.104
You wanted my boys
to breathe.

10:39.106 --> 10:41.406
Well, they're taking
a big breath.

10:41.408 --> 10:45.377
That's right.
The three  <i>amigos,</i>
<i>they're dining </i> <i>alfresco.</i>

10:45.379 --> 10:47.112
Have a nice day.

10:47.279 --> 10:49.280
Why are you patting my head?
What's happening?

10:49.282 --> 10:52.250
Nothing.
Nothing at all.

10:52.818 --> 10:55.787
What did you do?
What did you do?

10:55.789 --> 10:57.889
Holy (bleep).

10:58.924 --> 11:00.525
Where's my aqua net?

11:00.527 --> 11:03.461
Oh, your can
of hair spray!

11:03.463 --> 11:06.097
Yeah. I got rid of it
for your own good.

11:06.099 --> 11:09.801
Did you know
it's burning a hole
in the ozone layer?

11:09.803 --> 11:13.471
I don't want to hear about
some imaginary layer
in the sky.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.507
I'm leading a pta meeting
in 30 minutes,

11:15.509 --> 11:18.276
And I need
to command respect
with my giant hair!

11:18.278 --> 11:20.879
You get me the chair,
I'll give you the hair.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.148
Oh, you think
you beat me on this?

11:23.150 --> 11:26.384
Well, our daughter
has a whole arsenal
of hair products,

11:26.386 --> 11:28.787
And she has been dying
to give me a new look.

11:28.789 --> 11:31.122
Oh, my god.
What did I just hear?
Is this real?

11:31.124 --> 11:34.626
Are we finally getting rid
of that terrible
blonde helmet?

11:34.628 --> 11:37.429
Okay, close your eyes.
I'm doing your bangs.
Mmm-hmm.

11:37.431 --> 11:40.365
This is gonna be
totally rad.
Hmm.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.169
(sizzling)

11:51.444 --> 11:53.578
How's it looking?

11:53.879 --> 11:56.781
Really, really awesome.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.083
Oh.

11:59.819 --> 12:01.052
(screams)

12:01.054 --> 12:03.088
I know!
Oh, my god!

12:03.090 --> 12:05.390
I know!
How did this happen?

12:05.392 --> 12:06.624
I don't know!

12:06.626 --> 12:08.493
Oh! It fried my hair!

12:08.495 --> 12:11.029
Like, really quickly.
It's so unhealthy.

12:11.031 --> 12:13.932
It's like you have a head
full of sagebrush.

12:13.934 --> 12:14.766
(gasping)

12:14.768 --> 12:17.102
I know!
Oh, my god!

12:17.104 --> 12:19.204
What are we gonna do
about this?

12:19.206 --> 12:22.207
Okay. Okay.
Let's take a chill pill.

12:22.209 --> 12:24.709
I know I can fix this.

12:25.411 --> 12:26.745
Hi, pta.

12:26.747 --> 12:29.280
Let's talk spring fling.
(chuckles)

12:29.282 --> 12:30.048
What's with your hair?

12:30.050 --> 12:32.617
Don't look at it,
karen.

12:35.020 --> 12:36.020
Afternoon, friends.

12:36.022 --> 12:39.758
You're all looking
particularly small
today, huh?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.160
Hey, tyler.

12:42.895 --> 12:44.863
Cool frisbee.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.065
(chuckles)

12:47.533 --> 12:49.000
My frisbee.

12:49.002 --> 12:51.603
Yo, spinkter.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.538
Give me
those cheese doodles.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.172
Just take them, barry.

12:54.174 --> 12:56.674
Who's this barry
you speak off?

12:56.676 --> 12:58.910
(sighs) take them...

12:59.311 --> 13:00.411
Bus lord.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.212
That's right.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.414
<i>My plan for a bodyguard</i>
<i>had backfired,</i>

13:03.416 --> 13:06.751
<i>And now it was up to me</i>
<i>to banish our evil bus lord.</i>

13:06.753 --> 13:08.920
You know, I think I got
this bus stuff handled,

13:08.922 --> 13:11.089
So it's probably time
you go back and ride

13:11.091 --> 13:12.991
With erica and
her smoking-hot friends.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.059
Dude,
I'm never going back.

13:15.061 --> 13:18.296
This bus is mine now.
It's my home.

13:18.298 --> 13:21.132
Now, leave me be.
I find you boring.

13:21.200 --> 13:21.566
Stop!

13:21.568 --> 13:23.802
What just happened
on your shirt?

13:24.637 --> 13:25.470
Oh, it's hypercolor.

13:25.472 --> 13:26.871
The color changes
when you touch it.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.640
I bought it with
my lawn-mowing money.

13:28.642 --> 13:30.909
I want it.
What? No!

13:30.911 --> 13:32.377
You'll stretch it out.

13:32.379 --> 13:33.211
Good point.

13:33.213 --> 13:34.479
Then you will use
your hard-earned money

13:34.481 --> 13:38.449
To buy me one
that accommodates
my muscular body.

13:39.118 --> 13:40.652
(sighs)

13:45.424 --> 13:48.293
Your brother's
a real ass-bag.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.594
Yes. Yes, he is.

13:49.596 --> 13:53.731
This whole thing's been
a very eye-opening experience.

13:53.733 --> 13:55.967
I'm sorry for
the way I treated you.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.269
It won't happen again.

13:58.271 --> 13:58.870
(sighs)

13:58.872 --> 14:01.673
What do you say we get barry
off this bus for good?

14:01.675 --> 14:02.407
There's no way.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.743
(chuckling)
oh, there's always a way.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.212
(sniffs)

14:07.214 --> 14:10.014
Okay, look, everybody.
Come here.

14:10.016 --> 14:12.217
We all know
where we sit on this bus.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.952
Some of us
are back-row material.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.119
Some, like me, kind of
float in the middle.

14:15.121 --> 14:18.189

<i>about what row we sit in.</i>

14:22.729 --> 14:25.897

and take our bus!

14:25.899 --> 14:27.265
Now who's with me?

14:27.267 --> 14:27.765
I am!

14:27.767 --> 14:29.200
(sighs)
damn it, tyler.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.635
You scared the crap
out of me.

14:30.637 --> 14:34.138
(sighs) but I love
the enthusiasm.

14:37.877 --> 14:38.610
Whoa, stop!

14:38.612 --> 14:40.311
Don't park your pants
at the door.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.347
Rumor has it
you're going  <i>alfresco.</i>

14:42.349 --> 14:46.718
Oh, damn it. I forgot.
I miss my underpants.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.719
Ah, you'll
get used to it.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.521
I've been going  <i>alfresco</i>
<i>since the '70s.</i>

14:50.523 --> 14:52.223
<i>My dad didn't think</i>
<i>he could miss anything</i>

14:52.225 --> 14:54.259
<i>More than</i>
<i>his tightie-whities.</i>

14:54.261 --> 14:55.927
<i>Boy, was he wrong.</i>

14:55.929 --> 14:57.262
What the hell?

14:57.264 --> 14:58.496
Tv's gone, mur.

14:58.498 --> 14:59.797
Yeah, I see that.

14:59.799 --> 15:00.798
Beverly took it.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.699
I figured that.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.301
You lost the war, pal.
Stop talking.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.204
You know, I've been watching
these fish for 10 minutes,

15:06.206 --> 15:09.974
And I got to tell you,
it's some entertaining stuff.

15:09.976 --> 15:12.610
These two fish,
they're complete opposites.

15:12.612 --> 15:16.114
They'll never get along,
but they have to.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.583
They live
in close quarters.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.651
Stop talking!

15:19.653 --> 15:20.184
Isn't it great?

15:20.186 --> 15:23.588
It's like being in the lobby
of a benihana.
(chuckles)

15:23.590 --> 15:25.223
And the best part
about it is

15:25.225 --> 15:27.492
You need to constantly
tend to it.

15:27.494 --> 15:29.427
Getting rid of the tv,
that's nuts.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.696
That's the glue that holds
this family together.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.765
Everyone know that
tv strains your eyes.

15:33.767 --> 15:35.300
I did this
for your own good.

15:35.302 --> 15:37.568
Don't do anything
for my own good, okay?

15:37.570 --> 15:38.503
I'm fine.
I don't need your help.

15:38.505 --> 15:41.606
Really? Do you know
how many things
I do for you,

15:41.608 --> 15:43.074
Things you don't even
know anything about?

15:43.076 --> 15:48.813
So sue me if I want you
to sit in a chair that's
not a disgusting fart trap

15:48.815 --> 15:51.482
That ruins the scheme
of my entire living room.

15:51.484 --> 15:55.520
Aha! Right there!
You did it for you.

15:55.721 --> 15:57.121
What? (stammers)

15:57.123 --> 16:00.792
That hurts your back...
A chair that hurts
your back.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.194
Too late.
You said it.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.362
Yes,
that chair may be old,

16:04.364 --> 16:07.966
But it's because
I... I sit in it,
I sleep in it, I eat in it,

16:07.968 --> 16:09.567
I even raised
our children from it.

16:09.569 --> 16:11.235
I know you do
a lot for me.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.904
You do,
and I love you for it.

16:12.906 --> 16:15.306
But you didn't get rid
of that chair for me.

16:15.308 --> 16:18.409
You got rid of that chair
for you.

Move.

16:33.994 --> 16:36.194
Nah. I don't think
I'm gonna do that.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.061
This isn't a request.

16:37.063 --> 16:39.630
Either you do it
or I'll throw you

16:39.632 --> 16:40.965

16:40.967 --> 16:43.034

you purchased something
that I need.

That's my chair,
sweetie.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.384
No way, lady.
I will never
give you my chair.

Then give me $1 million.
No.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.769
I'd very much like to revisit
the boob conversation.

17:51.771 --> 17:52.503
No.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.005
Show me your boobs.
No!

17:54.007 --> 17:54.772
Then give me $1 million.

17:54.774 --> 17:57.308
Okay, I feel
like we're going
in circles, nitrous.

17:57.310 --> 18:01.612
And if you ask me,
(chuckles) this house
is full of boobs.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.413
I'm looking at them.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.715
And this place is a pigsty,
and you're all dressed
like slobs.

18:04.717 --> 18:10.354
And when was the last time
one of you ate a meal
with a vegetable?

18:10.923 --> 18:11.856
It's been a long time.

18:11.858 --> 18:15.326
Yeah. You don't need boobs.
You need your laundry done.

18:15.328 --> 18:16.060
You need your bed made.

18:16.062 --> 18:19.297
You need to scour
every surface in this house

18:19.299 --> 18:22.433
Before one of you gets
a wicked staph infection.

18:22.435 --> 18:26.370
It's just...
We don't know how.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.639

(thud)

19:15.722 --> 19:19.590
So, you finally got it.
That's cool, right?

19:19.592 --> 19:22.126
So that means we're cool,
too, right?

19:22.128 --> 19:24.028
You led a mutiny
against me, dude.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.396
We are most definitely
not cool.

19:25.398 --> 19:28.366
I didn't have a choice.
You went mad with power!

19:28.368 --> 19:30.768
Listen... I know
from the outside it may

19:30.770 --> 19:34.372
Seem like
I have a perfect life,
but the truth is

19:34.374 --> 19:35.773
There are a lot of jerks
at school

19:35.775 --> 19:38.042
That aren't
so nice to me.

19:38.177 --> 19:41.612
It was cool to have a place
where I had respect for once.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.948
I didn't know that.

19:44.383 --> 19:45.783
Here.

19:45.785 --> 19:48.119
Take your
garbage pail kids back.

19:48.121 --> 19:50.521
You don't need to pay me
to protect you.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.957
I want to because
you're my brother.

19:53.792 --> 19:58.429

No, it doesn't.
Okay.

20:41.139 --> 20:41.939
Erica!

20:41.941 --> 20:43.174
I've been honking
for forever.

20:43.176 --> 20:44.375
We're gonna be late
for school.

20:44.377 --> 20:46.344
Erica: I overslept.
Give me a second.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.113
What's up, lainey?
Got some good news.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.315
I'm gonna ride
with you guys again.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.351

20:53.353 --> 20:54.018
Wow.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.519
Got some hypercolor
there, huh?

20:55.521 --> 20:59.557
Yeah. You, uh...
Digging it?

20:59.559 --> 21:01.192
Actually...

21:01.194 --> 21:02.627
Yes, I am.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.694
You're looking
really good, bar.

21:03.696 --> 21:07.331
Got to be honest.
Never thought of you this way.

21:08.467 --> 21:10.134
Oh, no.

21:11.069 --> 21:12.637
Is it hot in here?

21:12.639 --> 21:14.038
Oh, yeah.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.306
It's hot.

21:15.308 --> 21:15.940
(chuckles)

21:15.942 --> 21:20.144
Lainey, stop messing
with him. Let's go.

21:20.579 --> 21:22.680
I knew she was
messing with me.

21:22.682 --> 21:25.783
I mean, come on.
Do I look stupid?
