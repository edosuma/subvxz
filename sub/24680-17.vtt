In New York City's war on crime,

00:05.004 --> 00:08.119
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:08.119 --> 00:10.072
of the Major Case Squad.

00:10.072 --> 00:12.766
These are their stories.

00:14.279 --> 00:16.094
You can't treat me this way.

00:16.094 --> 00:18.709
I have done everything you've asked.

00:18.709 --> 00:20.440
I told you things I shouldn't have.

00:20.440 --> 00:22.636
I trusted you, Daris.

00:22.826 --> 00:24.398
Anna, please.

00:24.398 --> 00:26.051
Hey, Doc,

00:26.051 --> 00:27.885
everything okay?

00:28.078 --> 00:29.854
It is now.

00:36.101 --> 00:38.797
Going up 15 d.B.'s.

00:39.247 --> 00:40.859
That got his attention.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.492
Thank you, Mr. Ribisi.

00:46.492 --> 00:48.421
You did very well.

00:49.586 --> 00:52.019
They won't stop 
until they get what they want.

00:52.019 --> 00:54.424
I've scheduled another 
round of tests for Friday.

00:54.424 --> 00:55.813
Friday?

00:55.813 --> 00:57.646
I'll have to let you know.

00:57.799 --> 01:01.603
Doctor, I can't tell you 
how much I appreciate your help.

01:01.603 --> 01:02.992
Thanks.

01:07.862 --> 01:08.973
Oh, my God.

01:08.973 --> 01:10.385
Doctor?

01:10.676 --> 01:12.068
Doctor, what is it?

01:19.260 --> 01:22.034
I am not sure 
I could live with myself.

01:22.034 --> 01:24.771
No matter what, Gary,
it's murder.

01:24.771 --> 01:26.062
You call it what you want.

01:26.062 --> 01:27.834
I'm not backing down.

01:35.062 --> 01:36.374
Water's freezing.

01:36.374 --> 01:37.806
That's the way I like it.

01:49.957 --> 01:51.367
I'll be home in a little bit.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.581
Oh, did Cindy talk 
to you about Steve?

01:53.581 --> 01:54.672
What'd she say?

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/03/28

02:53.657 --> 02:56.825
Dr. Ford was a neurologist.
She helped a lot of injured cops.

02:56.825 --> 02:59.122
- We consider her a friend.
- Then she's a friend of ours.

02:59.122 --> 03:01.183
You don't think 
the drowning was accidental?

03:01.183 --> 03:03.257
The regulars say 
she was a strong swimmer.

03:03.257 --> 03:04.789
Maybe a heart attack?

03:04.789 --> 03:06.483
Not likely.

03:06.912 --> 03:09.748
Not with blood in her sputum.

03:09.879 --> 03:11.189
Was she swimming alone?

03:11.189 --> 03:13.002
As far as anyone can tell.

03:14.655 --> 03:16.527
Excuse me.

03:24.027 --> 03:25.737
These hands. You see?

03:25.737 --> 03:29.114
They're red and irritated.

03:30.285 --> 03:32.602
I'm gonna need 
a shot of those.

03:32.602 --> 03:36.307
She hadjust come out of the pool 
and a guy grabbed her arm.

03:36.579 --> 03:38.566
Officer Purcell knew Dr. Ford.

03:38.566 --> 03:42.332
She helped my partner when
he was in rehab for a head wound.

03:42.332 --> 03:44.886
This guy hassling her,
you ever seen him here before?

03:44.886 --> 03:46.237
No.

03:46.237 --> 03:48.249
She swam the same 
time every night.

03:48.249 --> 03:50.705
Anyone wanted to find her,
it wasn't hard.

03:50.705 --> 03:54.394
Okay. Thanks. If you can stick around,
we need a description.

03:55.065 --> 03:57.178
It's like she just went to sleep.

03:57.178 --> 03:58.590
Come on.

04:01.367 --> 04:03.140
And drowned.

04:06.940 --> 04:09.493
Have the lab take a look at these.

Office Of Daris Maclevoy
York Hospital
Friday, February 27

04:13.902 --> 04:17.397
We were behind in our research,
she wanted me to work weekends.

04:17.397 --> 04:18.872
Uh, I wouldn't call it an argument.

04:18.872 --> 04:20.422
The officer who saw it did.

04:20.422 --> 04:22.355
And he's seen plenty.

04:24.676 --> 04:28.659
You're her research 
associate, right?

04:29.051 --> 04:31.223
That's what it says here...

04:31.223 --> 04:36.314
in your interim report 
we got from your grant supervisor.

04:36.445 --> 04:38.888
See? Your name's 
right under Dr. Ford's.

04:38.888 --> 04:42.275
"Coma care outcome analysis."

04:42.275 --> 04:43.529
What is that?

04:43.529 --> 04:46.855
Uh, we were evaluating if coma 
patients do better in a hospital...

04:46.855 --> 04:50.250
or in a long-term care facility.

04:51.502 --> 04:54.318
Research can't 
pay very much, can it?

04:54.318 --> 04:58.336
Now, is that why 
you moonlight at the lab?

05:00.672 --> 05:04.950
I guess the sacrifice is worth it, though...
getting your name on a major research paper.

05:04.950 --> 05:08.729
Yes, especially 
alongside Dr. Ford.

05:08.729 --> 05:10.972
Except we found another report.

05:10.972 --> 05:13.267
This one dated last week.

05:13.267 --> 05:16.773
And your name's been 
moved to the second page.

05:17.064 --> 05:18.997
What did you do to deserve that?

05:18.997 --> 05:20.550
Nothing. It's a typo.

05:20.550 --> 05:23.552
And what's this? 
A spelling lesson?

05:23.552 --> 05:24.551
I didn't write that.

05:24.551 --> 05:27.878
"Voodoo doctor." Maybe somebody 
had a problem with her research.

05:27.878 --> 05:30.158
Did you have a problem 
with her research there, Daris?

05:30.158 --> 05:33.397
No. No, I just did 
what Dr. Ford told me.

05:33.397 --> 05:36.691
Uh, it was the hours.
That was the only problem, you know?

05:36.691 --> 05:40.714
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I, um... I have a job interview.

05:44.061 --> 05:47.125
Cause of death is drowning 
following loss of consciousness...

05:47.125 --> 05:49.371
from an overdose 
of the painkiller fentanyl...

05:49.371 --> 05:52.315
100 times more potent than 
morphine according to the M.E.

05:52.315 --> 05:55.139
The inside ofher swimming gloves 
had been coated with fentanyl...

05:55.139 --> 05:57.822
dissolved in a gel 
of dimethyl sulfoxide...

05:57.822 --> 05:59.234
D.M.S. O...

05:59.234 --> 06:01.957
to help the fentanyl get 
absorbed through the skin faster.

06:01.957 --> 06:03.961
I remember something
about D.M.S.O.

06:03.961 --> 06:05.817
In Dr. Ford's files.

06:05.817 --> 06:09.378
So somebody stuffed this gunk into 
her gloves. She starts swimming.

06:09.378 --> 06:11.702
Twenty minutes later, 
she passes out.

06:11.702 --> 06:14.005
Where'd she keep her gloves 
when she wasn't using them?

06:14.005 --> 06:16.739
In her gym bag,
in her office or her car.

06:16.739 --> 06:18.942
Places this kid 
Daris had access to?

06:18.942 --> 06:20.085
Here we go.

06:20.085 --> 06:21.816
A purchase order for D.M.S.O.

06:21.816 --> 06:24.852
Signed by Dr. Ford 
and dated a month ago.

06:27.127 --> 06:29.281
I don't remember seeing D.M.S.O.

06:29.281 --> 06:32.647
In her research papers 
or her grant application.

06:35.043 --> 06:38.149
Can you google the medical 
applications for D.M.S.O.?

06:42.068 --> 06:45.834
"D.M.S. O: A commercial 
solvent derived from wood."

06:45.834 --> 06:49.571
It's only been approved by the F.D.A.
To treat interstitial cystitis.

06:49.571 --> 06:51.061
Bladder infections.

06:51.061 --> 06:53.035
Not exactly Dr. Ford's specialty.

06:53.035 --> 06:57.601
Unless she was using it 
for unapproved purposes.

06:58.412 --> 07:00.204
Get a search warrant.

07:00.204 --> 07:02.238
See what they were really up to.

07:02.828 --> 07:08.550
Before you walked in,
we found brain scans in your files...

07:08.822 --> 07:10.914
dated last month.

07:11.104 --> 07:16.434
The notes say 
a 46-year-old male, E.V.S.

07:16.645 --> 07:21.658
Now, your grant supervisor told us 
that stands for "Extreme Vegetative State."

07:21.658 --> 07:27.398
See? There's a "before" scan,
and there's an "after" scan.

07:29.935 --> 07:33.473
Before and after what?

07:36.049 --> 07:38.121
A dose of D.M.S.O.?

07:38.452 --> 07:40.391
What'd you do to these people?

07:40.391 --> 07:42.703
It was Anna's pet project.

07:42.703 --> 07:46.713
She believed that a vegetative state was 
just another form of consciousness.

07:46.713 --> 07:50.600
She wanted to prove these patients were 
capable of complex brain activities,

07:50.600 --> 07:52.983
even interaction 
with their environments.

07:52.983 --> 07:54.535
They were given D.M.S. O...

07:54.535 --> 07:56.839
and then they were monitored 
while they listened to music.

07:56.839 --> 07:58.515
Uh, and the result was?

07:58.515 --> 08:00.506
Subject to interpretation.

08:00.506 --> 08:01.957
Is that why you were demoted...

08:01.957 --> 08:03.511
because of your lack of conviction?

08:03.511 --> 08:07.249
No. I messed up.

08:07.249 --> 08:08.761
There's a right-to-die lawsuit...

08:08.761 --> 08:11.428
the parents of a woman in 
a permanent vegetative state.

08:11.428 --> 08:13.399
They wanted to 
take her off life support.

08:13.399 --> 08:15.745
Her husband doesn't.

08:15.745 --> 08:19.050
Anna was going to be 
an expert witness on his behalf.

08:19.050 --> 08:21.523
Then the parents' 
lawyers deposed me.

08:23.329 --> 08:26.116
Because they wanted
the dirt on Dr. Ford?

08:26.116 --> 08:28.748
Did you tell them about 
the research with D.M.S.O.?

08:28.748 --> 08:30.151
It slipped out.

08:30.151 --> 08:31.701
They got me all flustered.

08:31.701 --> 08:33.977
Oh, I can't imagine how.

08:35.229 --> 08:36.942
You sure you won't come?

08:37.392 --> 08:38.885
I'm sure.

08:47.845 --> 08:53.132
We might not have a lot 
of time left to spend with her.

08:53.919 --> 08:56.716
The lawyer said with 
what happened to that doctor,

08:56.716 --> 08:59.673
things might go faster now.

09:01.315 --> 09:05.465
I guess everything 
happens for a reason.

09:05.975 --> 09:10.592
No, they don't. We just say that 
to make ourselves feel better.

09:15.232 --> 09:17.552
Law Offices Of Charles Ergen
533 Fifth Avenue
Monday, March 1

09:17.552 --> 09:21.087
Laraine Farrell's been in 
a vegetative state for six years.

09:21.597 --> 09:24.903
The only reason the husband's 
opposing us is for sentimental reasons.

09:24.903 --> 09:27.416
He can't let go even 
though it's the right thing to do.

09:27.416 --> 09:30.521
That's, uh, Daris Macelvoy's 
deposition; that's Dr. Ford's.

09:30.521 --> 09:34.069
Dr. Ford is a neurologist 
with a good reputation.

09:34.069 --> 09:37.450
Her testimony would have weight.

09:38.381 --> 09:39.613
You weren't worried.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.216
Mm. For about 30 seconds.

09:41.216 --> 09:44.060
Then Mr. Macelvoy opened his mouth 
about the unauthorized research.

09:44.060 --> 09:46.033
He said you got him all flustered.

09:46.033 --> 09:48.126
I'm a lawyer.
That's what I'm paid to do.

09:48.126 --> 09:51.855
The question to Dr. Ford about 
her experiments with D.M.S.O.,

09:51.855 --> 09:56.785
she answers, "Neural-stimulation 
therapy is a legitimate field of research.

09:56.785 --> 09:59.240
Don't call it voodoo medicine.

09:59.909 --> 10:02.646
We're not turning 
people into zombies."

10:03.977 --> 10:07.434
But I can't see...

10:07.434 --> 10:10.550
where you, uh,
called it "voodoo medicine."

10:10.550 --> 10:15.531
- That's because I didn't.
- This is edited, right?

10:15.531 --> 10:18.765
Redacted, but everything 
Dr. Ford and I said is in there.

10:18.765 --> 10:20.627
So someone else was in the room,

10:20.627 --> 10:23.281
someone who called it 
"voodoo medicine."

10:23.281 --> 10:25.431
And her a "voodoo doctor."

10:26.784 --> 10:29.408
Okay. You don't have subpoenas.

10:29.408 --> 10:31.098
These are private records.

10:31.098 --> 10:32.869
Nice meeting you, Detectives.

10:37.930 --> 10:42.689
My bet? His clients decided to 
exercise Dr. Ford's right to die.

10:44.783 --> 10:46.916
We only met Dr. Ford 
a couple of times.

10:46.916 --> 10:50.003
Uh, Mark... that's our, uh...
our son-in-law...

10:50.003 --> 10:54.124
he tried to get her to 
talk us out of the lawsuit.

10:54.239 --> 10:58.063
She told you about her experiments 
with people in a coma like your daughter?

10:58.063 --> 11:02.009
Uh, no. My daughter is 
not in a coma.

11:02.009 --> 11:04.695
She's in a permanent 
vegetative state.

11:04.695 --> 11:07.600
People in a coma, 
their eyes are closed,

11:07.600 --> 11:09.051
the power's off.

11:09.051 --> 11:13.581
Laraine, the power's on,
all the lights are burned out.

11:13.581 --> 11:16.096
People always get it confused.

11:16.096 --> 11:21.417
It must be so exhausting,
all the work you do for your daughter...

11:22.450 --> 11:25.336
I mean, right down 
to the I.V. Needle...

11:25.336 --> 11:27.367
the way it's...
it's taped to the arm...

11:27.367 --> 11:29.634
so that the tube doesn't 
brush against the skin.

11:29.634 --> 11:31.150
Mark did that.

11:31.150 --> 11:36.043
He took a nursing course so 
that he could be more involved in her care.

11:37.918 --> 11:39.226
Who's this?

11:39.226 --> 11:41.660
That's Gary, our grandson...

11:41.660 --> 11:44.212
Laraine's son by her first marriage.

11:45.224 --> 11:47.586
That picture must be eight years old.

11:47.586 --> 11:49.010
Birthday cake...

11:49.421 --> 11:52.977
says it's his 10th birthday.

11:54.269 --> 11:58.430
That would make him 18 now.

11:58.430 --> 12:00.159
Mm. As of a couple 
of months ago.

12:02.263 --> 12:06.401
He was with his mother 
when her heart failed.

12:06.401 --> 12:08.792
The lawsuit...

12:08.949 --> 12:11.096
it was his idea, isn't it?

12:11.746 --> 12:15.034
Uh, look, my wife has to 
give Laraine her bath now.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.407
L... I'm gonna have to 
ask you both to leave.

12:17.797 --> 12:20.312
Oh. Sure.

12:22.588 --> 12:25.823
Uh, thank you for letting us,
um, talk to you.

12:27.407 --> 12:30.891
By the way, uh, I was noticing 
the stains on your boots.

12:30.891 --> 12:32.747
That's lacquer, hmm?

12:32.747 --> 12:36.793
Oh, yes. I, uh... 
I make custom cabinets.

12:37.244 --> 12:38.925
What kind of solvent do you use?

12:38.925 --> 12:41.077
Uh, methyl sulfoxide.

12:41.268 --> 12:42.842
I'll remember that.

12:44.828 --> 12:47.322
Otherwise known as D.M.S.O.

12:48.090 --> 12:50.736
FARRELL IMPORTS
WINE WAREHOUSE
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
TUESDAY, MARCH 3

12:50.736 --> 12:53.220
Of course I was at 
Dr. Ford's deposition.

12:53.220 --> 12:55.574
- She was my expert.
- Was your stepson there?

12:55.574 --> 12:56.919
Gary? 
Yes. Why?

12:56.919 --> 12:59.242
We need to verify 
something he said.

12:59.242 --> 13:01.747
He called Dr. Ford 
a "voodoo doctor"?

13:01.747 --> 13:03.660
Yeah. He lost his cool.

13:04.050 --> 13:07.348
He's 18 years old.
He's an angry kid.

13:07.456 --> 13:08.918
Well, I guess he would be...

13:08.918 --> 13:12.044
having witnessed 
his mother's heart failure...

13:12.135 --> 13:14.882
feeling helpless.

13:14.882 --> 13:17.417
We were hiking upstate.

13:17.729 --> 13:19.921
I tried to help.

13:20.032 --> 13:22.576
I was a medical 
corpsman in the Guard.

13:22.576 --> 13:25.020
She had a preexisting 
heart condition.

13:25.020 --> 13:28.746
She got dehydrated,
which caused her heart failure.

13:28.746 --> 13:31.422
Um, I didn't know the area.

13:31.422 --> 13:33.175
I got lost.

13:35.229 --> 13:39.257
Tried my best. I couldn't get
her to the hospital in time.

13:39.726 --> 13:42.071
Sounds like Gary 
should be angry at you.

13:42.071 --> 13:43.741
Oh, he's had his share of that.

13:44.192 --> 13:47.343
Well, your wife's nurses said that he hasn't 
visited his mother since last summer.

13:47.343 --> 13:50.398
- Did something happen?
- He's been studying to be a paramedic.

13:50.398 --> 13:54.067
Maybe he just had 
too much of the hospital.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.679
And doctors.

13:57.132 --> 13:58.203
Wait a minute.

13:58.203 --> 13:59.455
What do you mean by that?

13:59.455 --> 14:03.958
His anger... maybe he 
decided to focus it on Dr. Ford.

14:03.958 --> 14:07.510
No, that's... that's not Gary.

14:08.321 --> 14:11.378
He is not a violent kid.

14:12.951 --> 14:13.981
One last thing.

14:13.981 --> 14:17.085
You had an appointment 
with Dr. Ford last Monday.

14:17.085 --> 14:21.441
Yeah. / It was the last 
appointment of the night.

14:21.441 --> 14:24.170
Her assistant saw you walk 
into the garage with her.

14:24.170 --> 14:26.579
You were probably with her 
when she found her car like this.

14:26.579 --> 14:30.166
What's the first thought that came 
to your mind when you saw that?

14:31.899 --> 14:34.553
It's my wife's kid, for God's sake.

14:41.102 --> 14:43.501
My grandfather said
you might try to talk to me.

14:43.501 --> 14:47.279
On the off chance that you 
might explain your behavior...

14:47.279 --> 14:49.682
like calling Dr. Ford names.

14:49.682 --> 14:52.257
I don't have to 
explain myself, okay?

14:52.326 --> 14:55.336
Well, that's not gonna 
look good on our report.

14:55.336 --> 14:57.382
- I don't care how it looks.
- Well, you should.

15:01.161 --> 15:04.838
It looks like you had access 
to the drugs that killed her.

15:04.838 --> 15:07.401
D.M.S.O. from your 
grandfather's shop...

15:07.401 --> 15:09.791
and fentanyl from one of 
your paramedic buddies.

15:09.791 --> 15:12.294
And it looks like you 
had access to her car

15:12.294 --> 15:13.966
where she kept 
her swimming gloves.

15:13.966 --> 15:17.063
That's nuts. I didn't kill her.

15:17.134 --> 15:19.659
Well, it's not all that bad, Gary.

15:19.931 --> 15:22.535
The fact that you're here...

15:22.535 --> 15:25.555
learning how to help people,
to save them.

15:25.555 --> 15:28.257
On the other hand, he is trying 
to pull the plug on his own mother.

15:28.257 --> 15:31.803
Well, I'm sure that 
he has an explanation for that.

15:32.654 --> 15:36.871
Something to do with 
your stint in the E.R. last summer?

15:38.244 --> 15:41.403
Your first whiff of death...
is that what did it?

15:42.675 --> 15:45.853
What'd you learn, Gary...
that death is peaceful?

15:45.853 --> 15:47.865
That it's a release?

15:47.961 --> 15:51.076
It's a good alternative to...

15:51.076 --> 15:54.222
six years of suffering 
and nothingness.

15:55.235 --> 15:57.068
Why not?

15:57.068 --> 16:00.816
I mean, Mom deserves 
better than lying in a bed,

16:00.816 --> 16:04.000
wearing a diaper 
and staring at the ceiling.

16:05.493 --> 16:07.467
Yeah, finally...

16:08.076 --> 16:10.580
you could do something for her.

16:10.835 --> 16:14.069
And you weren't about to let 
that quack doctor stop you.

16:14.069 --> 16:15.620
I didn't kill her.

16:15.620 --> 16:19.768
You failed your mom six years ago.

16:20.399 --> 16:23.644
I didn't fail her.
I tried to help her.

16:23.644 --> 16:25.618
I wanted to give her my water
when she got thirsty,

16:25.618 --> 16:26.998
but Mark wouldn't let me.

16:26.998 --> 16:29.775
He didn't want two dehydrated 
people on his hands.

16:29.775 --> 16:31.852
That's what we're talking about, Gary.
You were in the way.

16:31.852 --> 16:36.130
No. I even brought 
her water from a creek,

16:36.130 --> 16:38.474
but Mark said it was polluted.

16:38.474 --> 16:40.446
L... I wanted to help her.

16:40.446 --> 16:42.821
- I tried.
- Hold on.

16:44.384 --> 16:48.237
How did your stepdad know 
that the creek was polluted?

16:50.599 --> 16:52.692
He just said it was.

16:53.705 --> 16:56.460
I was a kid. 
I believed him.

16:59.049 --> 17:01.982
Your mother didn't 
have anything to drink?

17:01.982 --> 17:06.362
She finished her sports drink,
and then Mark gave her his,

17:06.362 --> 17:09.176
but no matter how much she drank,
it wasn't enough.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.512
Gary, I think we're done here.

17:16.945 --> 17:18.098
Thanks.

17:22.729 --> 17:25.521
How did the stepfather know the creek 
was polluted if he didn't know the area?

17:25.521 --> 17:26.574
He said he didn't know it.

17:26.574 --> 17:29.740
Either he's a psychic for 
Greenpeace or he's a liar.

17:30.985 --> 17:34.705
Farrell and his family were hiking 
in Hudson Highlands State Park

17:34.705 --> 17:36.688
when Laraine had her heart failure.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.753
When he was in the National Guard,
Farrell was stationed at Fort Hollings,

17:39.753 --> 17:41.165
right next door.

17:41.165 --> 17:45.363
His platoon hiked up 
in that park every day.

17:45.363 --> 17:47.667
He wouldn't have gotten lost.

17:47.777 --> 17:50.423
Unless he had something 
else on his mind,

17:51.255 --> 17:52.698
like a wife with heart failure.

17:52.698 --> 17:55.352
A heart failure that 
he probably caused.

17:55.352 --> 17:59.775
His wife Laraine, she was taking 
digitalis for a heart arrhythmia.

17:59.775 --> 18:03.197
Uh, dehydration drops 
the body's potassium level.

18:03.197 --> 18:08.791
According to this,
that causes heart palpitations.

18:08.791 --> 18:10.163
To control them,

18:10.163 --> 18:12.489
Laraine would have 
taken more digitalis.

18:12.489 --> 18:17.963
But dehydration makes 
the digitalis more toxic,

18:17.963 --> 18:20.399
which led to the heart failure.

18:20.399 --> 18:24.511
So to get the ball rolling, he'd have 
to make sure his wife got dehydrated.

18:24.511 --> 18:26.078
When he was in the Guard,

18:26.078 --> 18:28.682
he got a commendation 
for saving two soldiers...

18:28.682 --> 18:31.089
who got dehydrated 
during a march.

18:31.089 --> 18:33.358
They'd taken a diuretic 
to lose weight,

18:33.358 --> 18:36.002
an herbal tea 
called "Cat's Whiskers."

18:36.002 --> 18:37.477
It has a distinctive taste,

18:37.477 --> 18:39.417
that's why he used 
a sports drink to mask it,

18:39.417 --> 18:43.245
but it has the advantage of 
being hard to detect in an autopsy.

18:44.076 --> 18:46.279
Well, you've sold me 
it could've happened...

18:46.279 --> 18:47.571
not that it did.

18:51.180 --> 18:54.266
Well, maybe if we prove he's familiar 
with the murder weapon.

18:56.319 --> 19:00.104
This seems to be the way 
I remember the deposition going along.

19:00.104 --> 19:02.960
Except for where Gary called 
Dr. Ford a voodoo doctor.

19:02.960 --> 19:05.624
We need you to pinpoint 
where he said that.

19:07.518 --> 19:11.196
Sorry again about the heat.
Engineer's been out every day.

19:11.196 --> 19:12.439
He just can't get it right.

19:12.439 --> 19:15.779
Here you go. That's, uh,
plain water, straight up.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.929
I got myself some vitamin C and zinc.

19:19.083 --> 19:20.997
I'm, um, fighting a cold.

19:21.970 --> 19:24.666
Oh, it's okay.
I'll stick with what I've got.

19:24.666 --> 19:26.420
Diuretics.

19:26.555 --> 19:30.980
I had a baby three months ago.
I'm still a little bloated.

19:31.408 --> 19:33.284
I told you to stay away from that stuff.

19:33.284 --> 19:35.000
Ask him.

19:35.169 --> 19:38.538
Your commendation 
when you were in the Guard...

19:38.538 --> 19:40.192
you saved those guys.

19:40.192 --> 19:41.687
They were drinking diuretics.

19:41.687 --> 19:43.181
Yes, they were.

19:43.952 --> 19:45.487
See? Stick to exercise.

19:45.487 --> 19:46.982
I'm sure it's safe.

19:46.982 --> 19:49.100
Right? You've tried diuretics.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.537
No. No, I haven't.

19:53.132 --> 19:56.070
This is it. This is where...

19:56.070 --> 19:58.429
where Gary had his blowup.

20:01.793 --> 20:03.407
Let me mark that.

20:04.180 --> 20:05.372
Where was it?

20:05.372 --> 20:06.927
Uh, at the end.

20:08.703 --> 20:11.226
I'll just make copies...

20:11.226 --> 20:13.541
and then we'll need 
you to initial them.

20:23.666 --> 20:26.536
That's not mine. 
I think this is yours.

20:26.536 --> 20:28.291
It's, uh, plain water.

20:31.304 --> 20:34.203
No, that's hers.
I can tell by the taste.

20:34.275 --> 20:38.894
Herbal, salty, right?
It's got a funny name. Uh...

20:39.206 --> 20:41.101
- Cat's Whiskers.
- Cat's Whiskers.

20:41.552 --> 20:46.507
Okay. Just initial each 
one next to the notation.

20:46.507 --> 20:49.135
I thought you said 
you never tried diuretics...

20:49.967 --> 20:51.773
yet you recognized the taste.

20:51.773 --> 20:54.243
No, actually, l... I think I did.
The specific taste of Cat's Whiskers.

20:54.243 --> 20:58.273
I tried... I tasted it 
while I was in the Guard.

20:58.273 --> 21:00.091
I'm... I'm finished...

21:00.091 --> 21:02.811
And I need to get back to work.

21:08.285 --> 21:09.418
Well, I'm sold.

21:09.418 --> 21:11.112
He tried to kill his wife.

21:11.345 --> 21:13.179
But Dr. Ford?

21:13.179 --> 21:16.240
Once a murderer,
always a murderer.

21:19.852 --> 21:23.346
At the time of her heart failure,
Laraine had a hundred grand in assets.

21:23.346 --> 21:25.245
According to her will,

21:25.245 --> 21:28.173
all of it would have gone 
to her son, Gary, if she died.

21:28.173 --> 21:29.633
Same with her life insurance.

21:29.633 --> 21:32.929
If her husband had 
no financial motive to kill her,

21:32.929 --> 21:36.249
did he suddenly take 
an intense dislike to her?

21:36.249 --> 21:38.171
It's hard to believe,

21:38.171 --> 21:40.545
seeing he's nursed her
for the past six years,

21:40.545 --> 21:42.989
and he's fighting to keep her alive.

21:42.989 --> 21:47.483
Why would he murder a doctor 
he hired to help keep his wife alive?

21:47.483 --> 21:51.337
Dr. Ford performed 
tests on Laraine Farrell.

21:51.337 --> 21:54.494
Maybe she found trace evidence 
of what Mark did to her.

21:54.494 --> 21:57.927
If she found it, so can the M.E.

21:57.927 --> 22:03.049
Dr. Ford tested Laraine Farrell's 
response to sounds, pictures, smells...

22:03.049 --> 22:05.982
but other than a few spikes on 
a brain scan during a sound test,

22:05.982 --> 22:08.653
there was nothing unusual.

22:08.653 --> 22:12.211
You know, with all due respect 
to the forest that died for this,

22:12.211 --> 22:14.282
Laraine's medical files are 
a whole lot of nothing,

22:14.282 --> 22:15.941
forensically speaking.

22:15.941 --> 22:19.715
There's no evidence of foul play,
no trace of a diuretic.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.325
All right. Mark Farrell...

22:26.840 --> 22:32.737
told the hospital that Laraine started 
having convulsions at 5:22 p.m.

22:33.308 --> 22:37.476
What kind of man looks at his watch 
when his wife's having heart failure?

22:37.476 --> 22:40.827
I mean, one minute, plus or minus...

22:40.827 --> 22:42.889
it's crucial when the heart fails.

22:42.889 --> 22:46.711
Five minutes either way is 
the difference between life and death.

22:52.109 --> 22:54.113
He was timing himself.

22:55.892 --> 22:59.801
We'd been hiking 
maybe half an hour...

22:59.801 --> 23:03.010
when Mom started 
having palpitations.

23:03.010 --> 23:06.670
She took one of her heart pills.

23:07.464 --> 23:11.406
How much later did you turn back?
You remember the place on the map?

23:11.939 --> 23:15.940
Right here is the creek I told you about.
That's when we turned back.

23:15.940 --> 23:18.242
Your mom was pretty sick by then.

23:18.396 --> 23:27.181
Yes. She was delirious,
saying crazy things to Mark.

23:27.332 --> 23:29.357
What was she saying?

23:29.607 --> 23:32.964
"You can't touch it. It's changed."

23:32.964 --> 23:35.026
Stuff like that.

23:36.224 --> 23:38.065
And then?

23:39.302 --> 23:41.665
Uh, you got lost?

23:41.983 --> 23:47.099
We must've wandered 
around for about...

23:47.099 --> 23:49.524
40 minutes.

23:51.286 --> 23:54.335
Then Mom collapsed.

23:55.473 --> 23:59.134
You must've ended up 
pretty close to the car.

23:59.134 --> 24:00.673
Do you remember 
where you parked?

24:00.673 --> 24:02.959
Was it at the head of 
the trail or at the other end?

24:02.959 --> 24:04.881
Neither.

24:04.881 --> 24:06.279
On the way up,

24:06.279 --> 24:08.491
Mark overshot the exit 
to the parking lot,

24:08.491 --> 24:12.998
so we just parked 
by this rest area.

24:12.998 --> 24:15.322
Uh, can you show us on the map?

24:15.672 --> 24:21.080
It was right past the stone bridge.
Right here.

24:21.873 --> 24:26.827
And he insisted 
that you park there?

24:26.827 --> 24:33.843
Yeah. He said hejust wanted 
to get out and start hiking.

24:35.318 --> 24:37.953
The main parking lot is 
10 minutes from the hospital.

24:37.953 --> 24:41.012
The parking lot at the other end 
of the trail is 30 minutes.

24:41.012 --> 24:43.436
He parks here.
He gets to the hospital in time.

24:43.436 --> 24:45.919
Laraine is saved.
No brain damage.

24:45.919 --> 24:49.168
He parks here, 
he gets there too late. She dies.

24:49.168 --> 24:51.082
If he drove around 
in circles, his kid would notice.

24:51.082 --> 24:54.870
He'd wanna look like he was 
pedal-to-the-metal the whole way.

24:54.870 --> 25:02.317
He timed it to get to the hospital...
in time to save her life,

25:02.317 --> 25:05.305
but not in time to 
prevent brain damage.

25:06.750 --> 25:10.170
He, for some reason,
wanted her to be helpless.

25:10.170 --> 25:12.505
I don't even wanna think 
what he gets outta that.

25:12.505 --> 25:18.022
Her will says that her 
assets go to her son.

25:18.022 --> 25:21.403
But as long as she's alive,
Mark stays in control of those assets.

25:21.403 --> 25:24.202
A hundred grand...
Hardly seems worth the trouble.

25:24.202 --> 25:30.129
Before she met Mark,
she was a widow with a small child.

25:33.895 --> 25:36.210
The will is registered in 
St. Charles Parish in Louisiana.

25:36.210 --> 25:37.988
She was living in New Orleans.

25:37.988 --> 25:39.527
Maybe living well.

25:39.527 --> 25:40.985
What was she doing?

25:40.985 --> 25:44.466
Uh, her social security records say 
she was making four grand a month...

25:44.466 --> 25:48.592
working for a company called 
Pontchartrain Industries.

25:48.592 --> 25:50.573
And even those people 
were stiffing her.

25:50.573 --> 25:53.276
They never paid their 
share of her payroll tax.

25:53.276 --> 25:55.864
Company probably 
went out of business.

25:59.114 --> 26:00.472
Oh, not just out of business.

26:00.472 --> 26:03.080
It, uh, imploded.

26:03.080 --> 26:07.448
They swindled their investors,
plundered their employee pension fund.

26:07.448 --> 26:09.026
This all happened nine years ago.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.705
Mm. When Laraine 
was working for them.

26:10.705 --> 26:12.702
Talk to the lawyer 
who drew up the will.

26:12.702 --> 26:14.979
I'll put in for travel vouchers.

26:20.457 --> 26:22.398
What are you reading to her?

26:23.435 --> 26:25.416
The Little Prince.

26:27.098 --> 26:29.603
She used to read it to her son.

26:35.575 --> 26:38.101
Laraine's parents may be right.

26:41.435 --> 26:44.062
It may be time to let her go.

26:44.554 --> 26:47.320
We'll support 
whatever you decide.

27:01.210 --> 27:03.456
LAW OFFICE OF BURTON FOCHE
NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA
THURSDAY, MARCH 11

27:03.456 --> 27:06.725
You have to understand Miss 
Laraine was a single woman.

27:06.725 --> 27:12.071
Just about all the money she had in the world 
was tied up in Pontchartrain's pension plan.

27:12.071 --> 27:15.119
And this is the pension plan that she 
found out had been gutted by her boss?

27:15.119 --> 27:16.377
Yes, sir.

27:16.377 --> 27:18.159
She was frightened.

27:18.159 --> 27:20.199
She had her son to care about.

27:20.199 --> 27:24.638
Before the ship went down,
she dipped into the company coffers.

27:24.638 --> 27:26.035
What'd she do with the money?

27:26.035 --> 27:28.438
It's in a trust in a private bank.

27:28.438 --> 27:32.203
The bank wires Miss Laraine 
a preset monthly stipend.

27:32.203 --> 27:33.945
If she dies, the trust goes to her son?

27:33.945 --> 27:37.912
Yes, sir. / And if she's incapable 
of making any decisions?

27:37.912 --> 27:40.938
Oh, there's no provision for this.

27:40.938 --> 27:45.648
Uh, as long as she's alive, the trust 
will continue to send the stipend to her...

27:45.648 --> 27:48.638
or to her legal guardian...

27:48.638 --> 27:51.697
$10 million over 15 years.

27:51.697 --> 27:53.697
- Sir?
- Excuse me a second.

27:54.813 --> 27:57.214
Mark found out he was 
married to an embezzler.

27:57.214 --> 27:59.213
He wanted the money for himself.

27:59.213 --> 28:00.351
Yeah, so he put her on ice.

28:00.351 --> 28:03.287
His very own frozen asset.

28:05.162 --> 28:09.124
The trust limits how much money 
can be withdrawn every year.

28:09.917 --> 28:14.668
Um, which means that Mark 
has to keep Laraine alive...

28:14.668 --> 28:18.714
until the trust fund 
pays out the last dime...

28:18.714 --> 28:20.254
six years from now.

28:20.254 --> 28:22.395
He's gotten $5 million so far.

28:22.395 --> 28:25.464
- What's he done with it?
- We can't trace it.

28:25.464 --> 28:28.513
There's a record here Laraine changed 
the password on her trust account a week

28:28.513 --> 28:30.694
before her 
heart failure.

28:30.694 --> 28:33.939
Sounds like she knew 
Mark found her account.

28:33.939 --> 28:36.503
Well, on the... on the hiking trip,

28:36.696 --> 28:39.080
Laraine told Mark,

28:39.080 --> 28:42.129
"You can't touch it. It's changed."

28:44.435 --> 28:47.020
She knew what she was doing.
She was...

28:47.020 --> 28:51.642
She was telling him that 
if he killed her,

28:51.642 --> 28:52.958
he couldn't get 
ahold of the money.

28:52.958 --> 28:54.486
Whatever she knew, 
it doesn't matter.

28:54.486 --> 28:56.810
It's locked up in her head.

28:58.028 --> 29:00.593
Well, the M.E. Found 
spikes on a brain scan

29:00.593 --> 29:03.690
that Dr. Ford took of 
Laraine during a sound test.

29:03.690 --> 29:07.392
Dr. Ford believes that 
people in Laraine's state...

29:07.392 --> 29:11.065
are capable of interacting 
with their environment.

29:11.065 --> 29:16.781
Now, maybe Dr. Ford found a way 
of communicating with Laraine.

29:17.013 --> 29:21.522
She got these results playing Ms. Farrell 
a tape of her son singing in a school recital.

29:21.522 --> 29:23.361
Laraine recognized his voice.

29:23.361 --> 29:25.000
Anna thought so.

29:26.195 --> 29:30.821
Anna would ask Ms. Farrell if 
the voice belonged to her son...

29:30.821 --> 29:36.074
and Ms. Farrell would answer 
by looking at one of these two cards.

29:36.074 --> 29:38.277
Six out of 10 times,

29:38.277 --> 29:40.883
she looked at the "Yes"card.

29:41.556 --> 29:43.941
To me, that's not conclusive.

29:45.137 --> 29:48.528
But to Dr. Ford?

29:48.528 --> 29:50.474
She thought it was promising.

29:50.474 --> 29:53.712
Anna wanted to show the results 
to Ms. Farrell's parents.

29:53.712 --> 29:56.617
But she didn't. 
The husband objected.

29:56.617 --> 29:58.878
Yes. He wanted to be sure.

29:58.878 --> 30:02.283
He gave permission for more tests,
but only if they were done in his presence.

30:02.283 --> 30:03.797
How did those tests go?

30:03.797 --> 30:05.819
The first session,
the results were the same...

30:05.819 --> 30:07.176
inconclusive.

30:07.176 --> 30:08.535
The second session?

30:08.535 --> 30:10.900
There never was a second session.

30:11.252 --> 30:13.818
Mr. Farrell kept canceling it.

30:13.818 --> 30:18.590
Maybe he didn't think the results 
were all that inconclusive.

30:21.560 --> 30:23.865
It is really coming down.

30:24.117 --> 30:26.059
It's gonna be a wet one tomorrow.

30:31.385 --> 30:33.004
What is he doing here?

30:33.178 --> 30:36.025
Now, Mark has 
something to tell you.

30:37.323 --> 30:41.506
Gary, I'm not fighting 
the lawsuit anymore.

30:44.456 --> 30:46.951
I've already told my lawyer.

30:55.257 --> 30:58.408
Some people leave their 
vegetative state, don't they?

30:58.408 --> 31:01.619
It happens, but the odds are 
overwhelmingly against it.

31:01.619 --> 31:03.138
Excuse me.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.607
It is like she's watching us.

31:07.607 --> 31:11.379
If Mark convinced himself 
that Dr. Ford was getting through,

31:11.379 --> 31:15.183
Laraine started telling 
her what she knew...

31:15.183 --> 31:17.707
He'd pull the plug on the doctor.

31:17.707 --> 31:21.176
Um, excuse me. 
What is that?

31:21.176 --> 31:23.265
It's an analgesic patch.

31:23.265 --> 31:27.183
It releases the painkiller through 
the skin over a period of 48 hours.

31:27.183 --> 31:29.951
- She's in pain?
- She gets muscle cramps.

31:29.951 --> 31:33.055
She let's us know. She starts groaning.
That's when we use the patch.

31:33.055 --> 31:34.532
Excuse me.

31:38.096 --> 31:39.717
That painkiller fentanyl?

31:39.717 --> 31:41.438
Yes.

31:43.741 --> 31:45.451
Can I see that?

31:52.802 --> 31:56.153
If someone got the full dose within 
a half hour, what would happen?

31:56.153 --> 31:58.132
They'd lose consciousness.

31:58.546 --> 32:00.754
Could you check Laraine's chart,

32:00.754 --> 32:03.928
see if she was wearing 
a patch three weeks ago?

32:05.449 --> 32:07.332
Yes, she was.

32:07.332 --> 32:12.174
In fact, we had to use a second patch.
She wasn't responding to the first.

32:12.888 --> 32:14.731
Okay, Laraine.

32:14.731 --> 32:16.693
We need to talk to Carver.

32:18.526 --> 32:20.740
CHAMBERS OF JUDGE GILCREST
TUESDAY, MARCH 16

32:20.740 --> 32:24.836
The victim visited the witness a number 
of times... in the week preceding the murder.

32:24.836 --> 32:28.949
Whatever communication transpired 
might be material to the case.

32:28.949 --> 32:33.658
Communication? His so-called witness 
is in a permanent vegetative state.

32:33.658 --> 32:36.597
I have to say, Mr. Carver,
it sounds farfetched.

32:36.597 --> 32:37.857
Your Honor,

32:37.857 --> 32:41.314
the court has accepted testimony 
from minor children,

32:41.314 --> 32:43.153
the mentally handicapped...

32:43.153 --> 32:47.069
people who at one time were deemed
incapable of offering reliable testimony.

32:47.069 --> 32:48.346
Your Honor,

32:48.346 --> 32:51.319
last time we spoke to Mr. Ergen...

32:51.319 --> 32:54.234
he was representing 
Ms. Farrell's parents.

32:54.234 --> 32:56.157
He was trying to terminate her life.

32:56.157 --> 32:59.176
I still represent her parents 
and her husband.

32:59.176 --> 33:03.040
They now agree terminating her life 
with dignity is what she would have wanted.

33:03.040 --> 33:04.176
Maybe.

33:04.176 --> 33:06.178
But not before she has her say.

33:06.178 --> 33:09.860
Your Honor, at least let us 
make the attempt to interview her.

33:09.860 --> 33:14.329
The court can always 
rule on admissibility later.

33:14.329 --> 33:16.950
I look forward to it, Mr. Carver.

33:16.950 --> 33:18.693
Motion granted.

33:19.807 --> 33:23.398
This is like the exercises 
you did with Dr. Ford.

33:23.398 --> 33:25.190
These people are 
gonna ask you questions.

33:25.190 --> 33:28.158
You just answer them 
by looking at the cards.

33:28.158 --> 33:32.093
Good morning, Laraine. 
I'm Detective Eames, and this is Detective Goren.

33:32.093 --> 33:39.234
For the record, we have to tell you this is
for an investigation into the death of Dr. Ford.

33:41.193 --> 33:43.618
Do... Do you, um...

33:44.291 --> 33:47.177
Do you understand that, Laraine?

33:48.415 --> 33:50.918
I don't know what she's saying.
Yes or no?

33:50.918 --> 33:52.899
- Couldn't tell.
- Oh. I'm sorry.

33:52.902 --> 33:54.256
Nothing registered here.

33:54.256 --> 33:56.541
This is a lot of bull.
My mother doesn't need this.

33:56.541 --> 33:58.239
That got a spike.

33:58.239 --> 33:59.657
What?

34:01.882 --> 34:04.165
She responded to your voice.

34:04.255 --> 34:06.090
It's the same response 
that Dr. Ford got...

34:06.090 --> 34:09.166
when she played your mother 
a tape of you singing as a kid.

34:09.166 --> 34:13.551
Now, Dr. Ford said that even 
pets can recognize voices,

34:13.551 --> 34:15.757
and that it doesn't mean anything.

34:15.757 --> 34:18.051
So why are you 
lowering your voice now?

34:18.051 --> 34:20.654
Are you afraid that she's gonna hear you,
that she might be hurt by you?

34:20.654 --> 34:23.178
Detective,
let's get on with it.

34:23.731 --> 34:29.326
Uh, Laraine, when Dr. Ford asked 
you questions, did you answer her?

34:30.201 --> 34:32.838
Yes. That was a 'yes."

34:32.838 --> 34:34.664
I don't know how you can tell.

34:34.664 --> 34:38.099
Her eyes are roaming 
all over the place.

34:38.099 --> 34:42.969
Laraine, we noticed that 
Dr. Ford stopped the tests.

34:43.244 --> 34:46.253
Uh, did she tell you why?

34:47.360 --> 34:50.639
Yes. / Was it because 
she wanted them to stop?

34:50.639 --> 34:53.161
- No.
- Was it your doctors?

34:53.161 --> 34:56.949
- No.
- Was it your husband?

34:59.841 --> 35:01.263
Uh, I'm not sure.

35:01.263 --> 35:03.501
Well, it looked like a "yes" to me.

35:04.215 --> 35:06.963
Uh, did you stop the tests?

35:07.234 --> 35:13.454
No. No, I just told Dr. Ford that 
I wanted to be there when she did them.

35:13.454 --> 35:15.781
I was very busy though.

35:15.781 --> 35:20.198
Laraine, is... is that true?
Was Mark too busy?

35:20.691 --> 35:22.530
She looked left.

35:22.530 --> 35:24.331
That was a "no."

35:24.782 --> 35:29.234
Is there another reason why Mark 
wouldn't want the tests to continue?

35:29.607 --> 35:30.621
Yes.

35:30.621 --> 35:35.111
Is it because there was something 
that he didn't want you to tell Dr. Ford?

35:37.072 --> 35:39.640
Yes. / Oh, come on. 
She's looking at both cards.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.854
Mark, be quiet.

35:43.104 --> 35:46.200
Is it because Mark did 
something to you to hurt you?

35:46.200 --> 35:47.558
Yes.

35:47.558 --> 35:50.967
Was it your heart failure?

35:50.967 --> 35:53.754
Was Mark the cause of it?

35:55.939 --> 35:57.880
Yes.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.563
Of course she'd say that.

36:04.563 --> 36:07.551
I was the one 
that organized the hike.

36:09.188 --> 36:11.453
Laraine, is that what you mean?

36:11.583 --> 36:12.851
No.

36:12.851 --> 36:20.653
Did he give you something to 
drink or to eat to poison you?

36:22.817 --> 36:25.199
She moved her eyes.
What'd she say?

36:25.199 --> 36:27.021
I'm not sure. It was ambiguous.

36:27.021 --> 36:29.594
It was ambiguous. 
It's all meaningless.

36:29.594 --> 36:31.473
Mark, if you don't shut up...

36:31.473 --> 36:33.012
Take it easy.

36:33.012 --> 36:36.251
Laraine, is there a reason 
why Mark would want to hurt you?

36:36.764 --> 36:40.047
Yes. / Is it because Mark 
wanted something from you...

36:40.047 --> 36:42.632
uh, maybe money?

36:42.906 --> 36:44.225
- Yes.
- What money?

36:44.225 --> 36:46.647
Come on.
Shejust had a small savings.

36:46.647 --> 36:49.222
All that was promised to 
Gary after she was gone.

36:49.222 --> 36:51.868
- Laraine, was there other money?
- Yes.

36:51.868 --> 36:55.730
Money that no one knew that you had,
money that you had hidden somewhere?

36:55.730 --> 36:59.427
Yes. / The reason why you hid it,
is that because you weren't supposed to have it?

36:59.427 --> 37:01.525
- Yes.
- Money you stole?

37:01.525 --> 37:05.834
Yes. / Wait a minute. Now you're 
trying to say that she was a thief...

37:05.834 --> 37:09.153
that I tried to kill her 
and that she's a thief.

37:09.153 --> 37:11.435
I want this crap stopped now!

37:11.435 --> 37:12.911
They have a judge's order.

37:12.911 --> 37:16.796
I wanna talk to you about 
the day that your heart failed.

37:17.490 --> 37:19.512
You were hiking.

37:19.765 --> 37:22.059
Do you remember that?

37:23.133 --> 37:24.936
No.

37:26.091 --> 37:28.115
I read it as a "no."

37:28.115 --> 37:30.115
Uh, you were hiking,
you got thirsty.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.136
Do you remember that?

37:32.311 --> 37:35.240
- Yes.
- You took some digitalis.

37:36.756 --> 37:38.495
No.

37:38.808 --> 37:41.271
What? / He's right. 
She looked at the "no" card.

37:41.271 --> 37:44.947
She took digitalis.
It's a fact.

37:44.947 --> 37:47.430
Now, what did I say?
This is all nonsense.

37:47.430 --> 37:51.613
Mr. Carver. / Detectives,
I don't see any point in continuing.

37:51.613 --> 37:54.853
Well, her heart failure may have 
affected her memory of that day.

37:54.853 --> 37:57.186
Then anything she had 
to say about it is suspect.

37:57.186 --> 37:59.492
We're done, Detective.

38:01.153 --> 38:02.491
It's all over.

38:08.506 --> 38:14.537
Mr. Carver, please,
just one more question.

38:20.317 --> 38:23.045
Laraine,

38:23.100 --> 38:26.963
this is about something 
that happened three weeks ago.

38:26.963 --> 38:31.876
Someone killed Dr. Ford 
using fentanyl and D.M.S.O.

38:31.876 --> 38:34.759
Is there something
that you can tell us...

38:34.759 --> 38:37.233
that would be relevant 
to her murder?

38:37.233 --> 38:39.856
Yes. That was a definite 'yes."

38:39.856 --> 38:41.909
- Is it something that you heard?
- No.

38:41.909 --> 38:44.293
Something that you saw?

38:44.723 --> 38:45.819
Yes.

38:45.819 --> 38:48.779
Is it something that someone 
brought into the room?

38:48.829 --> 38:53.438
- No.
- Something they took away?

38:53.751 --> 38:55.511
Yes.

38:55.511 --> 38:57.726
Was anything stolen from 
this room three weeks ago?

38:57.726 --> 39:01.247
I don't think so. Maybe there's 
something about it in her chart.

39:04.260 --> 39:06.645
This is supposed 
to be finished, right?

39:07.902 --> 39:10.206
You said that we were done.

39:10.206 --> 39:11.442
Apparently I was wrong.

39:11.442 --> 39:14.479
The only problem that 
I see is with the medication.

39:16.039 --> 39:17.376
She wasn't getting enough.

39:17.376 --> 39:19.315
That got a big spike.

39:20.128 --> 39:22.381
What kind of painkillers 
were you giving her?

39:22.381 --> 39:24.926
Fentanyl in dermal patches.

39:24.926 --> 39:27.936
Someone steal one of 
your fentanyl patches, Laraine?

39:27.936 --> 39:32.371
Yes. / Someone squeeze 
the fentanyl from the patch?

39:32.371 --> 39:33.829
Yes.

39:33.829 --> 39:35.816
Did you see who did this?

39:35.816 --> 39:36.725
Yes.

39:36.725 --> 39:39.956
That's it. It's over.

39:40.168 --> 39:42.904
You don't have to answer 
their questions, Laraine.

39:42.904 --> 39:44.284
No. You stay away from her.

39:44.284 --> 39:46.301
The detectives will 
finish their questions.

39:46.301 --> 39:50.727
And once your wife gives her answer,
I will prosecute Dr. Ford's killer to the full extent.

39:50.727 --> 39:54.502
There will be no plea bargains.
Do you understand?

39:55.255 --> 39:58.011
I will give you this one 
chance to tell the truth...

39:58.011 --> 40:00.435
or we'll get it from your wife.

40:07.210 --> 40:10.058
What do you think 
she's gonna do, Mark?

40:10.952 --> 40:14.614
What do you think she's 
been waiting to do for six years?

40:15.871 --> 40:20.600
See, you never thought 
she would have the chance.

40:22.099 --> 40:27.159
Then Dr. Ford showed you 
her response to her son's voice.

40:29.219 --> 40:32.419
And the more you 
looked into Laraine's eyes,

40:32.594 --> 40:35.658
the more you saw 
that she was still there...

40:36.644 --> 40:40.188
Waiting to tell the story
of what you did to her,

40:40.521 --> 40:44.587
waiting for Dr. Ford to 
find the right questions.

40:46.118 --> 40:49.981
I'd think you'd 
wanna come clean, Mark.

40:54.260 --> 40:59.705
Most criminals, yeah,
they get away with what they do.

40:59.957 --> 41:03.488
You know, they leave town,

41:03.488 --> 41:06.233
they bury the body.

41:07.511 --> 41:11.725
But not you. You've been 
tethered to Laraine for six years.

41:15.822 --> 41:21.893
You've been going through 
the motions of taking care of her.

41:22.303 --> 41:24.494
Only a monster could 
do that and sleep at night.

41:24.494 --> 41:26.395
You a monster?

41:26.927 --> 41:29.349
You're not a monster, are you?

41:29.601 --> 41:31.000
No, I'm not a monster.

41:31.000 --> 41:32.168
Oh, God, no.

41:32.168 --> 41:33.526
- If you'd only known...
- I'm not.

41:33.526 --> 41:36.376
what the last six years 
would have been like.

41:42.001 --> 41:43.398
Laraine, I have one 
more question for you...

41:43.398 --> 41:46.346
No. No, l...

41:47.321 --> 41:50.028
I took the fentanyl,

41:50.028 --> 41:54.326
and I used it to kill Dr. Ford.

41:56.689 --> 42:00.179
I was so afraid that you were 
gonna tell her everything.

42:01.136 --> 42:04.003
Please, Laraine.

42:04.003 --> 42:07.363
Please, forgive me.

42:11.600 --> 42:14.508
Forgive me for 
what I did to you.

42:14.508 --> 42:16.083
Oh, God. Please, Laraine!

42:16.083 --> 42:19.019
Just look at the cards 
and just say you'll forgive me!

42:19.019 --> 42:20.958
I need to know you forgave me.

42:20.958 --> 42:22.637
You're under arrest, Mr. Farrell.

42:22.637 --> 42:24.598
Just look at the cards.

42:24.598 --> 42:28.272
I need you to forgive me, Laraine.

42:28.463 --> 42:30.565
I need you to forgive me, Laraine!

42:30.565 --> 42:32.728
Please forgive me, Laraine!

42:33.301 --> 42:36.266
Good job. Thanks.

42:38.108 --> 42:40.591
My mother wasn't really 
answering the questions, was she?

42:40.591 --> 42:42.370
No, not our questions.

42:42.370 --> 42:43.467
I'm sorry.

42:43.467 --> 42:45.214
No, no. We understand.

42:45.214 --> 42:46.934
Uh, thank you.

42:50.461 --> 42:54.857
It's remarkable. Farrell convinced himself 
his wife could actually incriminate him.

42:54.857 --> 42:58.992
Well, never underestimate 
the power of a guilty conscience.

43:02.041 --> 43:04.425
Everything okay?

43:06.125 --> 43:09.810
I wonder. 
I really wonder.
