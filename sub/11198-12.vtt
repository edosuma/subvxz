<i>Previously on "Stargate SG-1":</i>

00:07.920 --> 00:10.320
He was unlike any warrior we have met.

00:10.400 --> 00:14.840
We could be dealing with
a new kind of technology.

00:14.920 --> 00:18.360
- Who was the first Goa'uld to find it?
- His name was Telchak.

00:18.440 --> 00:19.280
Telchak.

00:19.360 --> 00:23.520
If it was hidden near a water source,
it could be the basis of the mythology.

00:23.600 --> 00:27.360
It might be possible to engineer a weapon
to use against these warriors.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.720
C4!

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074

00:41.800 --> 00:44.600
What is your planet of origin?

00:46.560 --> 00:48.000
He just gave us his home world.

00:56.520 --> 01:00.280
The State Department received a ransom
demand for Dr Jackson and Dr Lee.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.840
We've been given 72 hours to pay,
or they will be killed.

01:03.920 --> 01:07.520
- Do they know who's behind it?
- They haven't identified themselves.

01:07.600 --> 01:11.520
Intel indicates we're dealing with
Honduran antigovernment revolutionaries.

01:11.600 --> 01:14.160
They're following the book on this one.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.320
Officially, they have
no intention of paying any ransom.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.440
- Unofficially?
- Ties with their government are at stake.

01:20.520 --> 01:24.800
No one is willing to risk
breaking policy over this.

01:24.880 --> 01:30.000
So we send a team in to extract 'em.
We've done it before.

01:30.080 --> 01:34.400
The rebels think our tenuous relationship
with the Nicaraguan government

01:34.480 --> 01:37.840
will prevent us from taking action,
but they're wrong.

01:37.920 --> 01:39.800
The president has agreed to help.

01:39.880 --> 01:44.800
As we speak, he's requesting that
the CIA gather whatever intel they can.

01:44.880 --> 01:48.480
But whether he's willing
to risk an international incident...

01:48.560 --> 01:50.560
Thank you, sir.

01:50.640 --> 01:54.320
I'll let you know
the second I hear anything.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
<i>¡Apúrate, gringo!</i>

02:00.400 --> 02:02.400
<i>¡Rápido!</i>

02:04.240 --> 02:06.240
<i>¡Apúrate!</i>

02:17.000 --> 02:20.480
You have not had
water or food for two days.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.200
Mm!

02:28.800 --> 02:30.800
<i>Muy delicioso.</i>

02:31.880 --> 02:34.320
Pick of the season.

02:36.040 --> 02:38.040
This is very good.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.840
Today we're going to start slow.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.400
I'm going to ask you again.

02:51.120 --> 02:53.160
What is this?

02:57.120 --> 02:59.880
And this is the part where you do not talk?

02:59.960 --> 03:01.760
OK.

03:08.080 --> 03:09.240
Mm?

03:09.320 --> 03:12.320
For you... and your friend,

03:14.560 --> 03:17.160
if you tell me what this is.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.520
I don't know how long
someone can go without food,

03:22.600 --> 03:28.120
but I believe the human body
needs water every three or four days.

03:29.160 --> 03:31.160
It's an ancient artefact.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.560
- An artefact?
- Yeah.

03:37.640 --> 03:43.040
I'm an archaeologist.
That's what I do - I look for... artefacts.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.360
Well... I found one.

03:49.520 --> 03:55.240
Seriously, I'm an archaeologist. You can
look me up on the Internet if you want.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.720
Do you have a computer?

03:57.800 --> 04:00.400
It all makes perfect sense.

04:00.480 --> 04:03.480
You're nothing more
than an archaeologist,

04:03.560 --> 04:06.360
and you find and study artefacts.

04:06.440 --> 04:08.920
- It makes perfect sense.
- Hm.

04:09.760 --> 04:13.320
I'm going to ask you one last time.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.399
What is this?

04:19.800 --> 04:22.680
And again you're not so talkative.

04:25.800 --> 04:31.880
What gives you the right to come into
our country and steal valuable artefacts?

04:32.560 --> 04:37.000
You call yourself a scientist?
You're nothing but a thief.

04:37.080 --> 04:40.120
And you think you're better than me.

04:40.200 --> 04:44.480
- But I have reasons for what I do.
- I don't doubt that.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.480
Chalo.

05:04.920 --> 05:09.880
And here's something else
you should not doubt, compadre.

05:09.960 --> 05:14.040
You will tell me what I want to know.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.240
The CIA operative in Honduras,
an Agent Burke,

06:23.320 --> 06:25.880
says he knows where Dr Jackson
and Dr Lee were taken.

06:25.960 --> 06:28.280
- Burke?
- Do you know him?

06:30.720 --> 06:33.040
- Yes, I do.
- Anything I should know about?

06:33.120 --> 06:36.040
He's the only agent on this.

06:36.120 --> 06:39.920
- We're stuck with him regardless, right?
- Right.

06:42.760 --> 06:46.000
- Nothing you should know about.
- I see.

06:46.080 --> 06:48.640
He's requested
you participate in the extraction.

06:48.720 --> 06:50.640
The president has green-lit the op.

06:50.720 --> 06:55.960
There's a C-130 waiting at Peterson.
It leaves for Honduras in two hours.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.480
Yes, sir.

07:11.440 --> 07:14.040
- Sir?
- I'm going after Daniel.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.280
Good.

07:18.320 --> 07:23.320
- This other mission...
- Shouldn't be a problem, sir.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.520
- When do you leave?
- Now.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.840
Good luck.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.760
You too.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.160
<i>A este lado.</i>

07:50.160 --> 07:53.960
I don't know anything!
I don't know anything!

08:04.560 --> 08:07.680
We've confirmed that Anubis
has a base on Tartarus.

08:07.760 --> 08:12.880
A powerful sensor array prevents anyone
from approaching the planet unnoticed.

08:12.960 --> 08:18.160
The Stargate on Tartarus is inside the
structure with a force field protecting it.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.080
We need to know why Anubis
created this new soldier,

08:21.160 --> 08:25.160
confirm what we believe his intentions are
and, if possible, stop him. Any ideas?

08:25.240 --> 08:29.280
Even if we could defeat the force field, we
have to assume the Stargate is guarded.

08:29.360 --> 08:33.280
We must gain access to the planet
by shutting down the sensor array.

08:33.360 --> 08:37.240
<i>- I agree. The question is, how?
- (Selmak) I will walk through the Stargate.</i>

08:37.320 --> 08:39.440
- Selmak?
- Yes.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.799
Come again?

08:40.880 --> 08:43.360
I wear the armour of Anubis's assassin.

08:43.440 --> 08:47.960
According to your account on Ramius's
planet, it passed through the force field.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.800
But at what physical cost?
We have no way of knowing.

08:50.880 --> 08:54.240
The force field at that Stargate is
more powerful than the one we used.

08:54.320 --> 08:58.240
<i>(Jacob) I'm sorry, kid.
I'm with Selmak on this one.</i>

08:58.320 --> 09:00.480
He'll keep me alive.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.760
Does anyone else have a better idea?

09:07.920 --> 09:12.800
Once I've deactivated the sensor array,
a scout ship can then approach the planet.

09:12.880 --> 09:16.840
Radioactive isotopes taken beforehand
will permit us to move around freely

09:16.920 --> 09:19.920
without being detected
by sensors inside the base.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.360
- What's your exit plan?
- The scout ship.

09:23.440 --> 09:26.800
I will conceal it in one of the planet's
many low-lying chasms,

09:26.880 --> 09:29.680
powering down to further avoid detection.

09:29.760 --> 09:32.160
Major, you have a go.

09:43.960 --> 09:45.720
<i>¿Estás bien?</i>

09:45.800 --> 09:47.800
<i>Sí, bueno, gracias.</i>

09:54.200 --> 09:57.440
You don't look very happy to see me.

09:57.520 --> 10:02.440
I'd have given anything to see your face
when you heard my name.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.920
Hey, it's OK, man...

10:05.000 --> 10:07.000
It's not OK.

10:07.080 --> 10:11.480
I've got 48 hours to find my friend
before he's killed.

10:11.560 --> 10:17.360
- Just tell me what you know.
- OK, all business. I can dig that station.

10:18.880 --> 10:20.760
This is the last place Daniel was seen

10:20.840 --> 10:23.840
before he hired a Rogelio Duran
to take him into the jungle.

10:23.920 --> 10:29.880
A short time after that, he was snatched
by anti-Honduran extremists.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.240
And you know this... how?

10:32.320 --> 10:34.520
It's how this splinter group does business.

10:34.600 --> 10:38.720
Last year they kidnapped an important
engineer working on the Cajon River Dam.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.040
Big American contract,
insurance pays off,

10:41.120 --> 10:45.160
and they finance their little war
against the government with the ransom.

10:45.240 --> 10:49.480
- This engineer. Did he live?
- Yeah, he did. Sometimes they don't.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.800
- What about weapons?
- OK, this is colourful.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.840
Honduras and Nicaragua
are having a territorial dispute.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.400
I know what you're thinkin'.
When are they not?

11:00.480 --> 11:03.000
So anyone
in the "I hate Honduras" fan club

11:03.080 --> 11:05.760
can shelter behind
the Nicaraguan borders and buy guns.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.600
What kinda guns?
AKs, AKs for days.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.120
Nicaragua gets their stuff
from Russia now,

11:11.200 --> 11:13.840
but in the '80s they inherited
all of it from Cuba.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.600
They let us fight Cuba from their shores,
we got our asses kicked,

11:17.680 --> 11:20.320
and Cuba gives them the guns.

11:20.400 --> 11:25.960
We could get shot at by an AK-47
that was fired at the Bay of Pigs attack.

11:27.120 --> 11:30.760
- You've been down here too long, Burke.
- You think so?

11:30.840 --> 11:35.440
- You know why I got this crappy posting?
- Are you gonna blame me now?

11:35.520 --> 11:37.600
You coulda stood up for me.
Hillary left me.

11:37.680 --> 11:41.720
What happens when one team member is
killed and the other won't vouch for you?

11:41.800 --> 11:46.240
I didn't see what happened to Woods.
I told 'em what I knew. I wasn't gonna lie.

11:46.320 --> 11:52.800
I'm not talkin' about lying. I'm talkin' about
my head. We were buddies. You knew me.

11:57.200 --> 12:00.880
- I told 'em what I knew.
- You didn't tell 'em enough.

12:00.960 --> 12:05.800
And now you're here, stuck in
my part of the world. You need me.

12:05.880 --> 12:08.560
- And I'm calling it on this one.
- I don't think so.

12:08.640 --> 12:12.200
I know how to get over the borders,
I know where these rebels operate.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.320
- Oh, yeah, I'm in charge.
- No.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.880
- You're just the guide.
- Just the guide?

12:18.960 --> 12:22.640
- That's what you think of me now?
- That's right.

12:22.720 --> 12:26.960
You're not so gone you don't understand
the need for a clear chain of command.

12:27.040 --> 12:29.520
You wanna know how "gone" I am?

12:35.240 --> 12:36.960
<i>¿ Quieres algo más, señor?.</i>

12:37.040 --> 12:40.360
<i>Sí. Necesito un guía.</i>

12:41.960 --> 12:43.840
I am a guide.

12:43.920 --> 12:46.120
This? It's just my day job.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.600
I never thought I would die like this.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.800
Oh, you're not dead yet.

13:11.240 --> 13:14.880
I'm sorry, Daniel.
I couldn't take it.

13:17.600 --> 13:20.200
- I told them.
- What?

13:21.680 --> 13:23.760
What did you tell them?

13:23.840 --> 13:25.640
Everything.

14:03.720 --> 14:05.440
- How's that, sir?
- Pretty good.

14:05.520 --> 14:09.840
- Reminds me of my old football days.
- Did they have helmets in those days?

14:09.920 --> 14:11.240
Funny.

14:11.320 --> 14:15.720
- Jacob, you OK in there?
- It's surprisingly light.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.160
- I guess it's time.
- Good luck.

14:18.240 --> 14:20.240
Thank you, George.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.600
You. Come with me.

15:15.960 --> 15:17.960
Sit.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.160
You seem damaged.

15:51.160 --> 15:55.080
- Come on, Dad.
- The array is yet to be shut down.

15:55.160 --> 15:59.240
We are helpless to act. Even if we were
to attempt secure communication...

15:59.320 --> 16:05.800
We'd have to leave our hidden position,
making us visible to their sensors.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.640
- Thoth.
- Lord Anubis, I was not expecting you.

16:22.720 --> 16:25.400
Tell me how this one has fared.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.920
This one has just returned, my lord.

16:28.000 --> 16:32.640
I need time to finish my preliminary
analysis before I make a proper report.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.800
It can wait.

16:34.880 --> 16:39.480
There is a remote probe malfunctioning.
It requires your attention.

16:39.560 --> 16:41.440
Yes, my lord.

16:51.200 --> 16:53.720
So many things could go wrong.
He's so stubborn.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.800
<i>- Perhaps it is time to consider...
- (beeping)</i>

16:59.160 --> 17:02.480
The sensor ray is powered down.

17:04.200 --> 17:08.040
No doubt your father's stubbornness.

17:13.839 --> 17:15.839
<i>- Dad, we're on the way.
- (Jacob) Good.</i>

17:15.920 --> 17:19.240
<i>When you touch down, proceed
to the exhaust port assemblage.</i>

17:19.319 --> 17:23.040
<i>- I think I've found a way to get you in.
- Copy.</i>

17:34.560 --> 17:36.560
Now, hold up.

17:38.360 --> 17:42.560
- This is it.
- As I told you, there's nothing here.

17:42.640 --> 17:45.400
<i>(Burke) There is this well
in the middle of nowhere,</i>

17:45.480 --> 17:49.080
standard US military boot-tread
all around.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.680
Make a wish.

17:57.000 --> 18:02.640
What took you so long? How hard
could it be to track their GPS locators?

18:02.720 --> 18:06.000
I'm just kiddin'. I only been here
a couple of minutes myself.

18:06.080 --> 18:10.080
- Change your mind?
- In a manner of speaking.

18:10.160 --> 18:15.480
<i>- Vete. Regrésate a la cantina.
- ¿Cuatro mil? Muchas gracias, señor.</i>

18:15.560 --> 18:17.720
<i>Momentito.</i>

18:17.800 --> 18:19.920
This is the end of the road, man.

18:20.000 --> 18:24.000
You didn't think these guys were
gonna make it easy on you, did ya?

18:24.080 --> 18:27.560
- I'll take you where you need to go.
- For old times' sake?

18:27.640 --> 18:32.320
You know, I took an emotional inventory
and I realised that I have some issues.

18:32.400 --> 18:36.600
Thought maybe we can put
our petty differences aside on this one.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.960
You're gonna need me
when this thing goes down, buddy.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.680
Come on, give me a chance.
I won't let you down.

18:49.480 --> 18:52.160
<i>Sí, vete. Gracias. Vamos.</i>

18:53.000 --> 18:55.160
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

18:56.640 --> 18:59.200
Now we're talkin', sports fans!

19:01.400 --> 19:03.520
OK, my name is Burke
and I'll be your guide.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.880
Today we'll be looking at indigenous
vegetation of Central America.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.200
Watch your step, ladies.
It's not Minnesota.

19:10.280 --> 19:12.280
<i>(O'Neill) Easy.</i>

19:16.960 --> 19:23.320
If you value the life of your friend,
you will tell me what I want to know.

19:23.400 --> 19:28.080
Your friend told me this device may be
the origin of the "Fountain of Youth" myth.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.560
- Maybe.
- How does it work?

19:30.640 --> 19:34.760
I don't know. You grabbed us
five minutes after we found it.

19:36.120 --> 19:38.400
Who is this "Telchak"?

19:39.200 --> 19:41.000
He's a mythological figure,

19:41.080 --> 19:44.520
a Mayan god that may or may not
have lived here thousands of years ago.

19:44.600 --> 19:48.480
So this device is
many thousands of years old?

19:48.560 --> 19:49.400
Possibly.

19:49.480 --> 19:53.840
And this Mayan god
brought this device to this temple?

19:53.920 --> 19:56.040
For what purpose?

20:02.360 --> 20:06.160
- To hide it? To use it? I don't know.
- Use it? On whom?

20:06.240 --> 20:09.840
- People! Mayan people!
- What would it do to them?

20:09.920 --> 20:14.360
The research I used to find it just
gave a cryptic warning the device was...

20:14.440 --> 20:18.120
dangerous, even harmful.
That's all I know!

20:19.240 --> 20:22.560
I do not think it is so harmful.

20:24.360 --> 20:29.720
I have never in my life felt
as strong as I do right now.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.840
- You turned it on?
- Yes.

20:37.920 --> 20:41.400
Turn it off. You don't know
what you're dealing with.

20:41.480 --> 20:43.720
The effects of the device may be unstable.

20:43.800 --> 20:48.400
It's very dangerous. It's beyond
our comprehension. Turn it off!

20:48.480 --> 20:51.080
- You're lying.
- What if he isn't?

20:51.160 --> 20:54.600
The device is cursed.
Rafael, we should turn it off.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.480
Turn it off?

20:56.560 --> 21:01.480
- Do you not feel different as well?
- I do, and it scares me.

21:02.440 --> 21:04.560
<i>Por favor, Rafael.</i>

21:04.640 --> 21:07.720
If you will not turn it off... I will.

21:43.920 --> 21:44.920
What happened?

21:45.000 --> 21:47.520
I fooled the exhaust port
into purging the system.

21:47.600 --> 21:50.800
- I mean with the sensor array.
- I got held up.

21:50.880 --> 21:54.160
You weren't worried about me, were you?

21:56.200 --> 21:58.320
Help me get this off.

21:58.400 --> 22:03.360
Rebels move around a lot.
The grunts are self-taught bush fighters.

22:03.440 --> 22:06.240
It's harvest season.
Most of them tend to their farms now.

22:06.320 --> 22:13.120
Those who don't are ex-military, holding
up about 20 clicks northwest of Ocotal.

22:31.040 --> 22:34.360
Well... this wasn't
supposed to be on the tour.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.760
At least we know we're on the right track.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.560
I've been shot.

22:48.360 --> 22:51.360
Agh! No, no, no.

22:51.440 --> 22:53.800
<i>You have been shot.</i>

22:53.880 --> 22:55.960
<i>Sí.</i>

22:56.040 --> 22:58.760
Air Rescue should be here
in about an hour.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.920
I've been lying here for days.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.760
- What's another hour?
- Who did this?

23:03.840 --> 23:08.320
<i>Unos malditos bandidos
que mueren del dolor del culo.</i>

23:08.400 --> 23:10.320
All right, all right.

23:10.400 --> 23:14.880
- We're looking for two scientists.
- Dr Jackson?

23:14.960 --> 23:19.840
They have him.
They went north, across the border. Go.

23:19.920 --> 23:23.560
- We're not just gonna leave you.
- Sure you can, señor.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.640
Help will be here soon.

23:25.720 --> 23:30.160
Don't worry.
This is not the first time I've been shot.

23:32.080 --> 23:34.280
Save your friends.

23:35.680 --> 23:39.200
- Please. They owe me lots of money.
- Ah.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.800
I love American gum.

23:52.240 --> 23:53.800
Good guys.

24:13.520 --> 24:15.080
Speak.

24:15.160 --> 24:18.880
Lord Anubis,
one of the Kull Warriors is missing.

24:18.960 --> 24:21.600
What is the reason for this behaviour?

24:21.680 --> 24:23.920
There was... damage,

24:24.000 --> 24:27.240
but I believe our method of
governing the symbiote mind is flawed.

24:27.320 --> 24:29.880
Unacceptable.

24:29.960 --> 24:34.360
Determine the origin of the flaw
and report back to me.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.120
Yes, my lord.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.680
He moved, I killed him.
It was as simple as that.

24:47.760 --> 24:53.200
- I thought he was a hostile.
- It's all history, Burke. Now's not the time.

24:53.280 --> 24:56.520
I know we were out of position.

24:56.600 --> 24:59.880
I wanted to cut the angle down
as you approached the objective.

24:59.960 --> 25:02.520
I guess Woods was doin' the same.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.880
So you both took it upon yourselves
to improvise at the same time?

25:06.960 --> 25:08.960
That's right.

25:21.520 --> 25:26.160
- That's the third one I've seen.
- How many do you think Anubis has?

25:26.240 --> 25:31.560
There's no way of telling yet.
I'm just guessing, but at least a handful.

25:31.640 --> 25:35.240
The lab I was in
was made to service several.

25:53.800 --> 25:57.000
- Symbiote holding tanks.
- All empty.

26:00.280 --> 26:02.280
This one is not.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.360
- Shouldn't we at least wait till night-time?
- I don't think we have that long.

26:29.440 --> 26:34.000
- We won't get far before they kill us.
- If we stay, they'll definitely kill us.

26:34.080 --> 26:36.800
I saw the short-term effects of that device.

26:36.880 --> 26:40.480
I know what a sarcophagus does to
a person's sanity. This is more powerful.

26:40.560 --> 26:45.920
I don't want to stick around to find out
what long-term exposure does.

27:13.040 --> 27:15.320
Judging by the holding tanks in this room,

27:15.400 --> 27:20.600
Anubis must plan to have the queen
spawn thousands of Goa'uld. But why?

27:20.680 --> 27:24.200
A symbiote is spawned with the genetic
memory of the maternal bloodline.

27:24.280 --> 27:26.520
They're egomaniacal and power-hungry.

27:26.600 --> 27:28.880
Not a great combination for a foot soldier.

27:28.960 --> 27:31.640
That's right. But look at this.

27:31.720 --> 27:34.520
This queen, whoever she is,
must be in league with Anubis.

27:34.600 --> 27:38.680
She's preparing for a spawn cycle,
yet her brain-wave pattern is minimal.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.840
She has no intention of
passing on her genetic memory.

27:41.920 --> 27:45.960
- The symbiotes will be blank slates.
- Much like Egeria on Pangar.

27:46.040 --> 27:49.680
And Anubis will be free to
imprint them however he sees fit.

27:49.760 --> 27:53.400
No free will - they're drones.
They make the perfect soldier.

27:53.480 --> 27:57.480
Deadly, fearless, unquestioning loyalty.

27:57.560 --> 28:01.200
This is too similar to what happened
on Pangar to be a coincidence.

28:01.280 --> 28:05.920
- How did Anubis find out about Egeria?
- Jonas Quinn.

28:08.120 --> 28:11.480
Anubis must have found out
when he scanned Jonas Quinn's mind.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.720
If Anubis had any designs
on creating a drone soldier,

28:14.800 --> 28:18.280
that information would've been
the final piece of the puzzle.

28:18.360 --> 28:21.840
This queen must not
be permitted to spawn again.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.240
- Teal'c's right.
- OK.

28:24.960 --> 28:29.400
We take what time we have remaining and
try to find out what else Anubis is up to.

28:29.480 --> 28:32.680
Then we detonate the C4
and get outta here.

28:42.040 --> 28:44.840
Could be just a coupla clicks now.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.640
How can you trust me?

28:50.960 --> 28:52.280
I don't.

28:52.360 --> 28:55.440
Think I asked you to come here
so I could shoot you too?

28:55.520 --> 28:57.520
Why would I think that?

28:58.440 --> 29:01.960
- Forget I said anything.
- You've had opportunities before now.

29:02.040 --> 29:04.320
What's worse is that
you think I'm incompetent.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.240
For crying out loud, Burke.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.800
You're willing to go into a hot situation
with me watching your back?

29:09.880 --> 29:14.120
I have no choice, and I was thinking
of sending you in first, me watching you.

29:14.200 --> 29:16.280
You wanna know the truth?

29:17.360 --> 29:20.160
Come on, you really don't wanna know?

29:21.560 --> 29:24.200
Man, it wasn't my fault.

29:24.280 --> 29:29.920
I mean, I didn't choose, I just reacted.
It stinks, the whole damn thing stinks.

29:30.000 --> 29:33.520
You wanna know what really happened?
Fine, I'll tell ya.

29:33.600 --> 29:38.440
Woods was ghosting us.
He sold out, he was no good.

29:38.520 --> 29:42.160
He was sending out a rogue transmission,
giving our position away.

29:42.240 --> 29:49.040
Woods realised I was onto him, he turned
his weapon on me, and I just reacted.

29:50.360 --> 29:55.480
- Why didn't you come forward with this?
- You remember how close we were.

29:55.560 --> 29:59.440
The wives and the beers and the
barbecues. I couldn't do that to Cindy.

29:59.520 --> 30:02.520
It comes out Woods was a traitor,
she doesn't see a pension.

30:02.600 --> 30:04.480
A month away from his retirement?

30:04.560 --> 30:09.400
He wasn't retiring. He was setting himself
up as a mercenary for that warlord.

30:09.480 --> 30:14.720
He made his choice, he's gone.
That's all that matters.

30:22.720 --> 30:23.840
<i>(machine-gun fire)</i>

30:45.680 --> 30:47.680
That's not good.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.680
<i>¡Disparen!</i>

31:20.560 --> 31:22.680
No! No!

31:22.760 --> 31:24.640
You let them escape.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.720
<i>Vamos a matarlos.</i>

31:49.520 --> 31:54.040
There must be a console somewhere that
will let us access a log of recent activity.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.280
Even if it doesn't contain Anubis's plans,

31:56.360 --> 32:00.360
we might be able to gather intel
on the movement of his fleet.

32:00.440 --> 32:06.200
Nothing but labs, corridors
and storage in this direction.

32:06.280 --> 32:09.560
I think Anubis's quarters are this way.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.600
<i>(gunfire)</i>

32:40.880 --> 32:43.080
Bill, you gotta keep movin'.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.920
<i>¡Mátenlos!</i>

32:47.000 --> 32:49.000
<i>¡Mátenlos! ¡Síganme!</i>

32:50.200 --> 32:52.080
<i>(gunfire continues)</i>

33:10.000 --> 33:14.080
- I can't. I can't breathe.
- Yes, you can. Come on!

33:15.680 --> 33:18.400
Stay down. I'll draw them off.

33:39.920 --> 33:42.240
<i>(gunfire)</i>

33:58.960 --> 34:00.960
<i>(heavy marching footsteps)</i>

34:16.920 --> 34:21.719
<i>(Anubis) You are all my children,
Kull Warriors.</i>

34:21.800 --> 34:25.280
You are the instruments of my conquest.

34:25.360 --> 34:29.560
<i>(all) Hail Anubis! Hail Anubis!</i>

34:30.719 --> 34:32.800
Hail Anubis!

34:43.679 --> 34:45.880
Machete.

34:48.239 --> 34:50.679
I'm going to skin you alive.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.840
<i>(machine-gun burst)</i>

35:04.040 --> 35:06.680
How many more are there?

35:10.400 --> 35:13.480
- Daniel!
- That's it. You got 'em all.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.320
What are you doing here?

35:22.200 --> 35:25.160
There must be thousands of them.

35:25.240 --> 35:26.800
Fools!

35:37.080 --> 35:39.320
<i>(alarm)</i>

35:39.400 --> 35:42.920
- C4.
- Bra'tac, we need that ride, now!

35:43.000 --> 35:45.600
<i>(Bra'tac) I will be there momentarily.</i>

36:05.680 --> 36:08.120
- Will you be able to walk on this?
- Yeah.

36:13.320 --> 36:17.040
- Telchak's device reanimates dead tissue.
- Yeah, whatever.

36:27.840 --> 36:29.600
Hey, get down!

36:42.680 --> 36:46.280
<i>What's with the guy from Evil Dead?</i>

36:46.360 --> 36:48.960
- Um...
- Classified?

36:50.920 --> 36:52.960
Yeah.

36:53.040 --> 36:56.040
You guys are into some crazy crap, man!

36:59.320 --> 37:01.320
Got it!

37:17.560 --> 37:18.960
<i>- Go!
- (thud)</i>

37:19.040 --> 37:22.480
- What was that?
- It can't be good. Just punch it.

37:27.320 --> 37:30.480
- Someone has opened the rear hatch.
- We're mid-flight.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.760
<i>(heavy footsteps)</i>

38:09.200 --> 38:11.320
Teal'c, are you hurt?

38:11.400 --> 38:13.760
- Indeed.
- Where?

38:13.840 --> 38:15.840
My pride.

38:17.960 --> 38:20.440
An old man did what I could not.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.680
Sam?

38:27.560 --> 38:28.920
Sam.

38:30.960 --> 38:34.040
No, don't move. Just lie still.

38:37.520 --> 38:41.040
- What hurts?
- Everything.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.640
That's a good sign.

38:54.440 --> 38:59.240
Perimeter's clear. Just heard
from Air Rescue - they got the guide.

38:59.320 --> 39:03.520
- Rogelio?
- He's gonna be OK. They'll be here soon.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.320
Hey.

39:07.320 --> 39:11.680
- Nice backup.
- Sure thing, buddy. Anytime, anywhere.

39:13.760 --> 39:19.520
You know... I think I should recommend
that you be posted to a nicer place.

39:19.600 --> 39:23.480
A temperate zone?
Not too hot, not too cold?

39:23.560 --> 39:29.160
Fine-lookin' women that put out
like broken candy machines?

39:29.240 --> 39:31.520
Whatever. I'll see what I can do.

39:31.600 --> 39:33.600
Thanks, buddy.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.360
Is that the thing that
made the guy do that thing?

39:38.440 --> 39:43.240
- Yeah, it's OK. It's off now.
- Good. That's good.

39:43.320 --> 39:46.760
Yeah. At least, we think it's off.
It's not glowing any more, so...

39:46.840 --> 39:51.480
The glowing thing gives it away, so if it's
not glowing any more, it shouldn't be on.

39:52.360 --> 39:54.360
- Do you wanna hold it?
- No, no.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.400
That's crazy!

40:14.280 --> 40:16.640
So... Miss me?

40:17.320 --> 40:18.560
Of course, sir.

40:19.320 --> 40:22.480
It couldn't have been that bad.
You're all still alive.

40:22.560 --> 40:25.080
- As are you and Daniel Jackson.
- Daniel?

40:25.160 --> 40:28.520
- I'm fine. We got the device from Telchak.
- Good.

40:28.600 --> 40:30.800
Hopefully we can
engineer a weapon from it.

40:30.880 --> 40:35.040
You must, or we will be left helpless
to combat these new warriors.

40:35.120 --> 40:39.440
We have some bad news, sir. Anubis has
an entire army of these super-soldiers.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.240
There are thousands of them.

40:41.320 --> 40:44.520
The best we could do was delay
his ability to manufacture more.

40:44.600 --> 40:48.520
We'll debrief fully in one hour.
Welcome home.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.400
Hey.

40:55.840 --> 41:01.040
- So, nice command.
- We did manage to make it out alive, sir.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.560
There's that.

41:05.720 --> 41:07.160
Lunch?
