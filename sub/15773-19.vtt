00:08.537 --> 00:10.820
The only thing better than
a third cup of coffee?

00:10.945 --> 00:12.444
A forth cup of coffee.

00:17.102 --> 00:19.419
- Come on, we're gonna be late!
- Late for what?

00:19.420 --> 00:22.412
- To meet Steve St. James.
- Who?

00:22.413 --> 00:26.227
Steve St. James! He was the off duty
cop on the hit show Off Duty Cop.

00:26.336 --> 00:29.360
That old TV show about the
detective and his butler?

00:29.377 --> 00:32.218
- Chauffeur.
- Why would a detective have a chauffeur?

00:32.241 --> 00:33.936
Because he was Steve St. James...

00:33.996 --> 00:37.415
...the detective who couldn't let justice sleep
just because he was off duty...

00:37.440 --> 00:40.418
...so he had a chauffeur drive him
around to make justice not sleep.

00:41.414 --> 00:43.004
I need another cup of coffee.

00:44.755 --> 00:46.841
Come on, he's making an
appearance at the mall.

00:47.007 --> 00:49.655
I can't. I got a doctor's appointment.

00:49.686 --> 00:51.175
What's wrong with you?

00:51.261 --> 00:55.316
Nothing. It's my yearly physical.
When was the last time you got one?

00:55.317 --> 00:58.446
Never. I've never been to the doctor.
I'm the picture of health.

00:58.447 --> 01:00.054
[Coughing]

01:07.694 --> 01:09.805

01:13.476 --> 01:17.296
Ooh! Ooh! What is that shooting pain?

01:17.320 --> 01:20.685

PORKY: Thanks for inviting me, Daffy.

01:46.604 --> 01:50.311
Isn't it funny how you're always available?
No matter how last second...

01:50.366 --> 01:54.116
...you never have other plans.
Like you don't really have a life.

01:54.184 --> 01:57.310
Heh heh heh. Yeah, that is funny.

01:57.369 --> 01:59.747
Now, who's Steve St. James?

01:59.913 --> 02:02.667
Steve St. James. "Off Duty Cop."

02:02.833 --> 02:05.372
Give me your phone.

02:05.795 --> 02:08.377
- When are you gonna get a phone?
- Never.

02:08.378 --> 02:12.212
Cell phones are like doctors. The calling plans
are confusing, the buttons are too small.

02:12.259 --> 02:14.929
- But... Huh?
- Just watch this.

Steve St. James!

03:31.563 --> 03:34.275
Wow! I'm your biggest fan!

03:34.298 --> 03:37.119
Well, thank you very much.

03:37.187 --> 03:39.472
Would you like a signed copy of my book?

03:39.638 --> 03:42.273
Nah, books are like cell
phones and doctors...

03:42.289 --> 03:45.031
Takes forever to get an appointment
and I don't have insurance.

03:45.054 --> 03:47.396
- Will you sign my beak?
- Ugh.

03:49.147 --> 03:52.651
I can't see it. Sign his face.

03:55.403 --> 03:58.187
"Leslie Hunt"? Who's she?

03:58.219 --> 04:01.390
- I'm Leslie Hunt.
- You're Steve St. James.

04:01.611 --> 04:05.347
No, Steve St. James is a
character that I played on TV.

04:05.415 --> 04:07.571
- I'm Leslie Hunt.
- Who?

04:07.572 --> 04:09.260
I thought you said you were my biggest fan.

04:09.276 --> 04:13.589
I'm Steve St. James' biggest fan
and you're no Steve St. James.

04:14.962 --> 04:16.257
That's what I said.

04:16.423 --> 04:18.503
That's what I said.

04:19.261 --> 04:21.065
Ugh. I need a cup of coffee.

04:27.786 --> 04:31.951
Well, if he's not gonna be Steve St.
James, then I will.

04:31.975 --> 04:34.550
[Gasp] Daffy, that's stealing.

04:35.072 --> 04:37.022

Ahh.

[Slurps, hums]

04:48.191 --> 04:50.745
- Hello. Don't say it.
- What's up, doc?

04:50.776 --> 04:52.402
He said it.

04:52.477 --> 04:55.548
Are you OK? You seem a little jittery.

04:55.594 --> 04:59.386
Jittery? I'm not jittery. If anyone's jittery,
you're jittery. I'm not jittery.

05:00.669 --> 05:03.272

05:03.339 --> 05:06.384
- Everything looks fine.
- Great. See you next year.

05:06.407 --> 05:09.243
Whoa. There is just one thing.

05:09.259 --> 05:10.290
[Gasps]

05:10.291 --> 05:12.594
I knew it!
I knew you were hiding something.

05:12.605 --> 05:15.398
How long do I have?
A year? A month? A day?

05:15.417 --> 05:18.713
Am I contagious? If I'm contagious,
then those people need to know.

05:18.721 --> 05:20.554
You owe it to them!

05:20.587 --> 05:22.631

05:28.889 --> 05:30.740
What kind of a doctor are you?

05:30.749 --> 05:33.586
You're probably not even a real doctor.

05:43.052 --> 05:48.485
I was just gonna say that I think you
should stop drinking coffee for a while.

05:48.540 --> 05:51.241
You have too much caffeine in your system.

05:51.267 --> 05:54.255
It's what's making you so tense.

05:54.318 --> 05:57.603
Oh. Cut out coffee. No problem.

05:57.661 --> 06:01.053
Ahem. You could probably just tape this.

06:02.809 --> 06:03.810

just have 30 seconds of your time...

06:22.550 --> 06:25.561
...to tell you about a product
that could change your life?

06:33.353 --> 06:36.091
This product differs from
other similar products...

06:36.114 --> 06:39.491
- ...because of it's unique ingredients.
- I'm not interested.

06:40.777 --> 06:43.173
It's like coffee, but without the caffeine.

06:43.196 --> 06:45.707
- What's like coffee?
- Spargle.

06:45.775 --> 06:51.372
While coffee leaves you feeling jittery,
Spargle will leave you feeling rested and alert.

06:51.434 --> 06:54.599
- When did you get into this racket?
- I needed money quick.

06:54.634 --> 06:59.816
They said they were gonna take my house.
I mean, I believe in the product.

07:01.224 --> 07:02.401
[Slurps]

07:02.402 --> 07:05.302
- Tastes weird.
- Those are the Spargle berries.

07:07.222 --> 07:09.426
Wow. Could this be working already?

07:09.502 --> 07:12.200
I don't know. You won't catch
me drinking that stuff.

07:12.268 --> 07:14.285
- I'll take them.
- How many?

07:14.310 --> 07:16.328
BUGS: All of them.
- Cha-ching.

07:16.329 --> 07:18.994
I mean, it'll change your life.

07:34.895 --> 07:37.181
[Stammering] Where are we going, Daffy?

07:37.208 --> 07:41.043
I'm no longer, Daffy. I'm Steve St.
James, Off Duty Cop.

07:41.111 --> 07:43.458
And we're going wherever
justice is sleeping...

07:43.481 --> 07:47.970
...and needs to be woken up by me,
Steve St. James, Off Duty Cop.

07:48.136 --> 07:51.223
So I just keep going straight?

07:52.623 --> 07:54.869
Pull over.

07:55.727 --> 07:58.242
No, park illegally.

07:58.896 --> 08:01.964
More illegally. Like you don't
have time to play by the rules.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.743
Oh, sorry.

08:17.749 --> 08:20.502
- Will you marry me?
DAFFY: Freeze.

08:22.179 --> 08:23.999
- But he was...
- I know what he was doing.

08:24.039 --> 08:28.024
He was stealing your ring and beautifully
placing it in this elegant box.

08:28.098 --> 08:30.157
- No, I was...
- Assaulting her.

08:30.164 --> 08:32.306
And that's a code 9.

08:32.472 --> 08:35.472
I'm might be off duty,
but I'm not off my game.

08:37.313 --> 08:39.645
Looks like your meter's expired.

08:39.812 --> 08:41.707

08:41.738 --> 08:43.972
Day or night. Well, never before 11am.

08:44.041 --> 08:46.215
And don't call after 5:00. And also...

08:46.231 --> 08:49.036
...when you call, it'll be my roommate's
voice on the answering machine.

08:49.044 --> 08:52.037
I don't know how to change it.
Also, I don't know how to access messages.

08:52.051 --> 08:54.492
So just keep calling. Anytime.
Day or night.

08:54.660 --> 08:57.247
Between 11:00 and 5:00. And not on weekends.

we were there to wake it up.

11:06.550 --> 11:08.010
Good work, chauffeur.

11:08.051 --> 11:11.020
Are you sure the chauffeur
doesn't have a name?

11:11.056 --> 11:12.767
Nope, just chauffeur.

11:14.884 --> 11:19.929
Why is your house covered
in Christmas decorations?

11:19.996 --> 11:21.628
Isn't it always like that?

[Door open and close]

11:26.562 --> 11:30.618
Oh, hi. Hey. I hope you don't mind,
I did a few things around the house.

11:30.641 --> 11:33.226
I painted the garage,
I resurfaced the swimming pool.

11:33.242 --> 11:35.898
Oh, and I moved everything that was
in your room into the kitchen.

11:35.913 --> 11:37.874
But if you don't like,
I can move it back, no problem.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.764
I just have 3 hours left on the treadmill.

11:39.787 --> 11:42.826
But after that, I definitely can move
your stuff back into your bedroom.

11:42.841 --> 11:45.539
Unless you want me to move it into the garage.
I just painted it.

11:45.588 --> 11:47.548
- Are you OK?
- Never better.

11:47.556 --> 11:49.881
Never, ever, ever better.

11:49.957 --> 11:51.213
Are you guys itchy?

11:56.384 --> 12:01.003
Huh. I like it. Closer to the fridge.

12:01.071 --> 12:03.975
So you're saying the chauffeur
was in every episode...

12:04.000 --> 12:06.365
...and they never give him a name?

12:06.394 --> 12:08.313
I'll prove it to you.

12:12.677 --> 12:15.582
St. James, have your chauffeur
bring the car around?

12:15.653 --> 12:17.804
He's a human being, chief.

12:17.805 --> 12:20.835
He has a name. Brandon Steel.

12:20.836 --> 12:23.343
Use it. I do.

Oh, Brandon. Thank goodness you're here.

that still have Spargle in them?

- What is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

you doing in my house?

Oh, uh, I was just, uh,
I figured I'd stop by.

13:20.238 --> 13:24.238
I saw the window was unlocked. It seemed
like a great time to come over and hang out.

13:24.346 --> 13:27.650
I thought I was the only one who broke
into people's houses to hang out.

13:27.683 --> 13:30.245
Say, you know what goes well
with hanging out? Spargle.

13:30.276 --> 13:33.081
Do you have anymore Spargle? I
could really go for some Spargle.

13:33.089 --> 13:35.023
Don't got no more. You bought it all.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.165
What?! But I really need it.

SAM: Fine. Let me throw on some jeans.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.080
I said now.

13:54.619 --> 13:57.187
I always knew Bugs was a criminal.

13:57.255 --> 14:00.152
Chauffeur, looks like we're
going for a little drive.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.868
Hello, darlin'. You probably know me.

14:08.869 --> 14:11.415
I'm a Spargle sales representative.

14:11.435 --> 14:13.354
We have a lot of sales representatives.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.671
Heh heh heh.

14:14.739 --> 14:19.895
Yeah, well, I bet you don't have a lot
that sell a month's supply in one day.

14:19.943 --> 14:23.114
- See that guy over there?
- The one talking to that plant?

14:23.138 --> 14:24.911
I moved one of the bedrooms
into the kitchen...

14:24.912 --> 14:27.223
...but I think it would look better
in the garage. I just painted it.

14:27.239 --> 14:31.455
Well, thanks to him, your
company's about to get rich.

14:31.522 --> 14:35.792
And so am I, 'cause I get
4 cents on very can.

14:35.860 --> 14:36.544
[Laugh] [Crash]

14:36.820 --> 14:38.859
Freeze! You're all under arrest.

14:38.882 --> 14:40.538
Daffy, do not blow this deal.

14:40.565 --> 14:43.266
My name is Steve St. James...

14:43.334 --> 14:44.868
...and you're coming with me.

14:44.936 --> 14:47.680
I'm not going anywhere without my Spargle.

14:47.905 --> 14:50.516
Aah!

14:50.742 --> 14:52.185
[Theme music playing]

15:06.824 --> 15:08.458
Hey!

15:15.400 --> 15:16.167
Whoa!

15:30.148 --> 15:31.964
[Cat meows]

15:31.995 --> 15:33.948
[Stapler clicks]

15:35.353 --> 15:36.810
Uhh! Uhn.

15:41.793 --> 15:44.070
BUGS:
I just want my Spargle.

15:44.295 --> 15:46.716
- Put down the pen!
- Put down the stapler...

15:46.756 --> 15:48.310
...or I'll write all over the pig's face!

15:48.323 --> 15:50.501
Why does everyone want to write on my face?

15:50.509 --> 15:52.556
- Just give my Spargle.
- Put down the pen!

15:52.578 --> 15:54.247
It's permanent ink!

15:54.358 --> 15:57.308
- I said give me my Spargle.
- Put it down!

15:57.332 --> 15:59.285
- Permanent!
- I'm not leaving here...

15:59.310 --> 16:00.997
...until you give me my Spargle!

16:01.012 --> 16:03.756
- I said put it down!
- It won't come off!

16:03.981 --> 16:08.559
[Whistles]

16:08.594 --> 16:11.431
This is a place of business.

16:11.597 --> 16:16.726
These are hard-working people who
simply want to sell a quality product.

16:16.794 --> 16:20.464
What in tarnation is illegal about that?

16:22.100 --> 16:24.027
You're all under arrest.

16:24.193 --> 16:26.738
[All shouting]

16:26.904 --> 16:29.240
What's going on here?

16:29.406 --> 16:31.308
This whole operation's a scam.

16:31.375 --> 16:35.145
These things are filled with
dangerous, highly-addictive chemicals.

16:35.213 --> 16:37.749
How about but what about
the Spargle berries?

16:37.915 --> 16:39.082
[Sobbing]

16:39.150 --> 16:41.952
Somebody get that guy to a doctor.

16:43.421 --> 16:48.050
Am I under arrest? I'm just an
innocent sales representative.

16:48.216 --> 16:51.405
That all depends. Did you know you
were selling a dangerous product?

17:03.732 --> 17:06.335
Thanks for helping out.
I'll take it from here.

17:06.374 --> 17:08.834
Who are you?

17:08.905 --> 17:11.406
Steve St. James, Off Duty Cop.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.009
Arrest this one, too.

17:13.050 --> 17:16.540
- What did I do?
- You've been impersonating a cop...

17:16.540 --> 17:18.357
...and handcuffing people all over town.

17:18.413 --> 17:22.001
What about him? He's been
impersonating a chauffeur.

17:24.252 --> 17:28.096
That's not illegal. It's pathetic,
but it's not illegal.

17:28.232 --> 17:29.926
Get this guy out of my face.

17:31.593 --> 17:34.934
I'm putting you down as a witness,
so I'm gonna need your name, too.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.404
Brandon Steel.

17:40.282 --> 17:42.232
I'm just gonna put chauffeur.

17:43.274 --> 17:43.985

off coffee a day can't hurt.

Ahem.

20:37.493 --> 20:39.000
