depart from it."

thing by her,

06:56.274 --> 06:58.576
and let that be that.

than done.

- Wait a minute, what you
trying to say?

07:34.846 --> 07:36.981
- I'm just saying maybe it
was a little bit more--

07:37.082 --> 07:38.683
lil' bit more than a few years.

07:38.783 --> 07:43.321

than a few for you too.

it down like this?

08:11.916 --> 08:12.884

mean any harm.

08:38.275 --> 08:40.311

to know what you knew

08:40.412 --> 08:42.647
about teenagers in this
day and age.

08:42.746 --> 08:44.616
- Well, you know I raised
two daughters.

08:44.716 --> 08:46.651
- Did you?
- CORA: Yes, honey.

08:46.751 --> 08:49.421
They was tough, too.
I mean, they were a handful.

08:49.521 --> 08:50.989
Lord, have mercy.

08:51.089 --> 08:52.257
But we made it.

08:52.357 --> 08:53.425
- Were you married?

08:53.525 --> 08:55.026
- Yes, I was married a long
time ago

08:55.126 --> 08:56.494
but he passed away.

08:56.594 --> 08:58.363
- Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
- CORA: That's alright.

08:58.463 --> 09:02.033
But I do know teenagers,
and I taught high school.

09:02.133 --> 09:03.435
- Mmm, so you really know.

09:03.535 --> 09:05.937
- Yeah, I know a little bit
honey.

09:06.037 --> 09:07.138
Yes, baby, sit down.

09:07.238 --> 09:08.440
Sit down, let me tell you
something.

09:08.540 --> 09:12.844
You know, you gotta know
that a move like this

09:12.944 --> 09:15.513
can make a child doubt
a lot about what they know.

09:15.613 --> 09:17.349
You know,
moving into a new place,

09:17.449 --> 09:18.717
and new schools and
everything.

09:18.817 --> 09:20.085
- LEAH: New friends.
- New friends.

09:20.251 --> 09:21.720
- LEAH: Yeah, I mean,
I know this is gonna be

09:21.820 --> 09:23.254
hard for her, I really do.

09:23.288 --> 09:24.923
- Yeah.

09:25.023 --> 09:27.392
- But that does not mean
she gets to be disrespectful.

09:27.492 --> 09:29.160
- And you're right about that.

09:29.260 --> 09:30.562
- And she is grounded.

09:30.662 --> 09:31.996
- Well, I don't blame you
for that.

09:32.097 --> 09:34.632
She'd be grounded if she
was mine too, baby.

09:34.733 --> 09:36.768
And if she was my mama's child--
- Your mom?

09:36.868 --> 09:38.269
- She'd have a couple
black eyes.

09:38.303 --> 09:39.571
- Your mama?

09:39.671 --> 09:42.006
- Baby, she would have
double deuced, baby.

09:42.107 --> 09:44.042
- Ooh, oh.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.043
- She couldn't bob and weave

09:45.210 --> 09:46.678
'cause she would have
caught her.

09:48.213 --> 09:49.414
- My mom was like an octopus,

09:49.514 --> 09:52.250
hands coming from everywhere.
- Everywhere.

09:52.350 --> 09:53.518
- Heavyweight fighter.

09:53.618 --> 09:55.720
- Ooh, well I'm glad your
mom ain't here.

09:55.820 --> 09:59.657
- No, she better be glad
my mama ain't here.

09:59.758 --> 10:01.726
But listen to me, Leah.

10:01.826 --> 10:05.096
You did the right thing,
sweetheart.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.531
- Thank you, Ms. Cora.

10:06.631 --> 10:07.532
- You're welcome,
you're welcome.

10:07.632 --> 10:09.734
It's gonna be alright.

10:09.834 --> 10:13.905
- But why do I feel so bad
about it? [sighs]

10:14.005 --> 10:16.241
- ♪

10:20.312 --> 10:21.947
- Oh, don't cry, sweetheart.

10:22.047 --> 10:23.381
Baby, don't start crying

10:23.481 --> 10:24.816
'cause you gonna make me
cry and I don't wanna

10:24.916 --> 10:26.117
cry right now.

10:26.217 --> 10:29.154
I think I'm looking cute.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.990
- You are.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.992
I didn't do anything wrong,
though.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.126
- You didn't, sweetheart.

10:35.226 --> 10:36.628
You didn't do nothing wrong.

10:36.728 --> 10:38.463
- So why am I so sad?

10:38.563 --> 10:40.966
- Because it hurts sometimes
when we punish our kids.

10:41.066 --> 10:43.435
You know, it hurts to do
that to correct them.

10:43.535 --> 10:44.769
- I know.

10:44.869 --> 10:48.340
- It's for their own good, baby.
- Yeah, I know.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.574
- I get that you're upset.

10:49.674 --> 10:52.277
But this will help her
in the long run, okay?

10:52.377 --> 10:54.679
- Yeah. I just--I feel like

10:54.779 --> 10:56.448
parents just don't get a
handbook

10:56.548 --> 10:59.384
and I just want my family
to be happy.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.986
I want everybody to be happy.

11:01.086 --> 11:03.088
- Punishing your kids is good
for them.

11:03.188 --> 11:05.590
You just can't give them
too much freedom, honey.

11:05.690 --> 11:08.159
We still got to guide them
along the way.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.128
That's what's happening
out here in this world now,

11:10.228 --> 11:12.464
kids is getting too much
freedom.

11:12.564 --> 11:14.266
But as long as you giving
her good guidance

11:14.366 --> 11:15.433
they gonna be alright.

11:15.533 --> 11:18.003
Both of 'em, they gonna
be some good kids.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.704
- I understand that.

11:19.804 --> 11:22.207
- Let me tell you something,
don't feel bad about that, okay?

11:22.307 --> 11:23.275
She was wrong.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.047
But girl, let me say it again,
if my mama had seen her...

11:30.649 --> 11:32.183
- I gotta meet your mama!

11:32.284 --> 11:36.288
- No you don't, 'cause that's
old fashioned right there.

11:36.388 --> 11:37.555
With a capital F.
- Capital F?

11:37.656 --> 11:38.890
- Yes, honey.

11:38.990 --> 11:42.460
It would have been a whole
lot of slow walking

11:42.560 --> 11:45.630
and loud singing.

11:45.730 --> 11:48.400
- What you mean? A funeral?
- CORA: Yes, girl.

11:48.500 --> 11:50.602
She would've baptised her
in the wrong way.

11:51.970 --> 11:53.171
- Oh, my gosh.

11:53.204 --> 11:57.943

12:04.015 --> 12:06.618
- It's gonna be alright, baby.
- I know.

12:06.718 --> 12:08.820
- Alright.
- Thank you.

12:08.920 --> 12:10.488
- Now, what was you doing
before I got here?

12:10.589 --> 12:12.424
- Just trying to clean up
this place.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.926
- With no water?

12:15.026 --> 12:16.428
- I know, right?

12:16.528 --> 12:18.129
- That does make it
difficult, don't it?

12:22.767 --> 12:24.235
Well, I wonder what
the men doing out there.

12:24.336 --> 12:25.403
- Apparently nothing.

12:25.503 --> 12:26.605
Let's get them to do something!

12:26.705 --> 12:28.573
- Well, you know what?
I'mma try something.

12:28.673 --> 12:31.276
Let me see what I can do
with this plumbing.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.511
I know a thing or two, baby.

12:33.612 --> 12:35.580
I was a single mama.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.583
I know a lot about a lot.
- LEAH: Okay, alright.

12:38.683 --> 12:41.753
- Now, where is your tool...
I see a toolbox.

12:41.853 --> 12:44.322
- You know, my husband
don't know what a wrench is.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.360
- Your husband don't know
what a wrench is?

12:48.460 --> 12:50.595
- No, ma'am.
- That's so sad.

12:50.695 --> 12:52.264
These young men of today.

12:54.633 --> 12:56.901
Alright, now look.
Ooh, this one!

12:57.002 --> 12:58.870
Look at this big old vice grip!

12:58.970 --> 13:00.805
- You know the name of
everything, don't you?!

13:00.905 --> 13:03.041

when you're a single mama.

13:03.174 --> 13:04.342
- Okay!

13:05.677 --> 13:07.045
- Hi.

13:08.747 --> 13:10.849

13:10.949 --> 13:13.852
- I mean, I would but we
share the same bedroom.

13:16.888 --> 13:19.457
- Why did you do that?

13:19.557 --> 13:20.859
- What did I do?

13:20.959 --> 13:22.994
- Tell mom and dad about
him.

13:23.128 --> 13:25.130
- What do you mean?
I should have.

13:25.163 --> 13:26.431
- Why?

13:26.531 --> 13:29.134
- Because you shouldn't have
gotten in the car with him.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.635
- You know, they just make
us move here,

13:30.735 --> 13:32.671
and we have to do everything
they say.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.773
- Well, they are our parents.

13:37.642 --> 13:38.944
- Well, I don't like it.

13:39.044 --> 13:40.879

a choice.

13:40.979 --> 13:42.647
- God, you're such a loser.

13:42.747 --> 13:44.416

grounded loser.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.757
Yes, you are.
I heard them say it.

13:52.857 --> 13:54.559

13:54.659 --> 13:56.795

pretty little head.

14:00.198 --> 14:02.734

situation worse for yourself.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.869
- Yeah, well, whatever.

14:04.970 --> 14:07.072
- Why are you so
hard-headed?

14:07.172 --> 14:09.608
- And why are you such
a spoiled brat?

14:09.708 --> 14:11.176
- Just because I do what
they say,

14:11.276 --> 14:12.544
doesn't make me spoiled.
