cooled quickly.

than getting a present?

nopony finds one.

You're only allowed to
eat Rock Soup for dinner.

Then, the pony who finds this
rock gets to raise the flag,

13:19.499 --> 13:22.033
but not really cause you
don't got no flag pole.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.836
And to top it off, you
don't even get presents?

13:24.838 --> 13:28.873

fun when you say it THAT way.
