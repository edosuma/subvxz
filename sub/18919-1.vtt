00:59.605 --> 01:02.008
<i>It's been said that we are born alone.</i>

01:02.408 --> 01:04.209
<i>We live alone.</i>

01:04.310 --> 01:06.167
<i>We die alone.</i>

01:07.479 --> 01:09.821
Look what I got. Pick one.

01:11.482 --> 01:15.394
<i>But I never felt alone because
I always had my sister Sherri.</i>

01:18.056 --> 01:20.393
<i>Our mom was a junkie who died young.</i>

01:20.493 --> 01:22.804
<i>Skid Row became our home.</i>

01:26.448 --> 01:29.061
<i>Dancing was the light
at the end of the tunnel.</i>

01:33.802 --> 01:36.081
<i>We hustled hard to stay alive.</i>

01:46.515 --> 01:48.606
<i>But I messed up.</i>

01:49.452 --> 01:53.265
<i>Our entire stash, all the money we saved...</i>

01:56.558 --> 01:58.894
<i>...and the drugs...</i>

01:58.994 --> 02:01.007
<i>...were in that car.</i>

02:03.648 --> 02:05.701
<i>Man, I was stupid.</i>

02:05.801 --> 02:08.131
On the ground, now!

02:08.753 --> 02:10.832
<i>I got locked up.</i>

02:14.443 --> 02:17.068
<i>I left my sister with nothing...</i>

02:18.014 --> 02:20.380
<i>...and I can only blame myself.</i>

02:22.601 --> 02:24.192
<i>Five years in prison...</i>

02:25.188 --> 02:27.604
<i>...and six months in this dump.</i>

02:28.457 --> 02:30.581
<i>Court-ordered rehab.</i>

02:31.077 --> 02:33.801
<i>It's a long time to think about your past.</i>

02:34.497 --> 02:37.922
<i>Waiting each week for the phone to ring.</i>

02:39.268 --> 02:41.856
<i>Waiting to hear that my sister's okay.</i>

02:45.875 --> 02:48.188
<i>Without me there to protect her.</i>

03:07.763 --> 03:10.342
Hey, Wyatt! Phone call!

03:53.842 --> 03:55.311
- Hello?
- <i>Wyatt?</i>

03:55.411 --> 03:57.563
- Are you kidding me, Sher?
- <i>Listen to me.</i>

03:57.663 --> 04:01.657
I have called you every Monday for the
past year. Where the hell have you been?

04:01.757 --> 04:04.022
Wyatt, please!

04:04.820 --> 04:06.744
Where are you?

04:08.040 --> 04:10.831
I want to be cremated, okay?

04:11.527 --> 04:14.224
<i>I want my ashes dumped in the ocean.</i>

04:15.164 --> 04:19.051
I want my soul to be free.
Wyatt, promise me...

04:19.151 --> 04:22.204
I'll come get you. Just tell me where
you are, Sher, and I'll come get you.

04:22.304 --> 04:25.650
- Save it, you can tell me it all in person.
- Wyatt, please...

04:29.228 --> 04:30.347
Sher?

04:31.213 --> 04:32.837
Sherri?

04:33.883 --> 04:35.509
Sher?

04:38.087 --> 04:40.730
No. No. No. No!

04:51.800 --> 04:55.007
<i>I'm alive, and my sister's dead.</i>

04:56.605 --> 04:58.984
<i>It should be the other way around.</i>

05:14.357 --> 05:18.705
<i>Only one thing matters now.
I will find Sherri's killer.</i>

07:09.938 --> 07:11.728
Wyatt Wells?

07:12.074 --> 07:14.443
Detective Childers.

07:14.543 --> 07:16.178
Thanks for meeting me here.

07:16.278 --> 07:18.497
I need you to look at some photos...

07:18.597 --> 07:21.738
...so we can get a tentative
positive I.D. on the body.

07:22.384 --> 07:24.384
They found her down on Skid Row.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.564
She had a bullet in her head.

07:27.189 --> 07:31.426
Her face is all smashed in.
Then they burned the body.

07:31.894 --> 07:35.819
I figured whoever did this is...
trying to send a message.

07:36.215 --> 07:38.851
Her hands and her feet were bound.

07:38.951 --> 07:40.828
Wyatt, please.

07:46.875 --> 07:48.737
<i>It hurts.</i>

07:51.013 --> 07:52.882
Not that hard.

07:54.683 --> 07:56.895
<i>Wyatt, does it look good?</i>

07:59.921 --> 08:01.690
Yeah, it's her.

08:01.790 --> 08:04.081
- Positive?
- Yeah.

08:05.427 --> 08:07.951
They dumped her belongings nearby.

08:09.401 --> 08:11.770
You need to hold on to this for evidence?

08:11.870 --> 08:14.775
No, the only prints on there were Sherilyn's.

08:16.175 --> 08:19.346
- What type of gun did they use?
- Nine millimeter.

08:20.896 --> 08:23.900
- Anything else?
- You...

08:24.650 --> 08:27.186
...you spoke to her before she died.

08:27.286 --> 08:29.922
Do you have any idea
who would have done this?

08:30.422 --> 08:32.558
I was locked up for a while.

08:32.658 --> 08:35.394
Spent the last six months in rehab, so no.

08:35.894 --> 08:38.230
I don't know much of anything.

08:38.330 --> 08:41.288
Well, you think of something,
you give me a call.

08:42.366 --> 08:44.605
She wanted to be cremated.

08:46.105 --> 08:49.645
- Can you guys do that?
- What about your family?

08:51.527 --> 08:53.068
I'm all she had.

12:03.218 --> 12:05.615
Hey. I saw you sneak in back, bitch.

12:05.715 --> 12:10.317
- Liam, I've been looking for you.
- Give me one second, okay?

12:47.946 --> 12:50.849
- Hey.
- Quite a show you put on up there.

12:51.249 --> 12:53.892
- Yeah, I'm a little out of shape.
- Found something?

12:53.992 --> 12:56.689
No. I'm looking for my friend.
She works here.

12:56.789 --> 12:59.625
At least I think she works here
but I can't seem to find her.

12:59.725 --> 13:01.515
Sherri. Do you know her?

13:03.811 --> 13:06.865
Anyway, sorry you have to leave so soon.

13:06.965 --> 13:08.522
Out.

13:11.402 --> 13:13.044
Let's go.

13:22.483 --> 13:24.548
Alright, alright.

13:26.585 --> 13:29.234
- What's going on?
- Man, this dude tryin' to sneak in.

13:29.334 --> 13:32.859
Yeah, the kid...
tried to come in around back.

13:34.359 --> 13:35.928
Bould.

13:36.528 --> 13:39.271
<i>Ciao</i>, baby. Back off.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.099
- What's your name?
- Wyatt.

13:44.369 --> 13:46.305
I'm Kipling.

13:46.405 --> 13:48.941
This is my place.

13:49.041 --> 13:54.413
I saw you out there kicking and prancing.
Wanna make a few extra bucks?

13:55.013 --> 13:56.869
Sure. Why not?

13:57.149 --> 13:59.318
Come on, Kip.

13:59.418 --> 14:02.755
You're trying to hire a dude?
We're not that kind of club.

14:02.955 --> 14:04.824
That's ridiculous.

14:05.824 --> 14:08.980
Liam, give me a minute, okay? Just go away.

14:12.447 --> 14:14.304
Yes, sir.

14:17.234 --> 14:21.007
We get a lot of pretty girls in here,
you know? Hire a lot of them.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.544
It creates this illusion.

14:25.344 --> 14:30.133
What I need from you
is bring that energy to this club.

14:30.233 --> 14:32.251
Drive it forward.

14:32.751 --> 14:34.820
Think you can do that?

14:34.980 --> 14:36.902
Whatever you need, man.

14:37.322 --> 14:40.459
Cool. You're the man now.

14:40.559 --> 14:44.563
That beautiful girl, Emma, she's my daughter.

14:44.663 --> 14:47.966
My joy. My life.

14:48.066 --> 14:50.336
You don't touch.

14:51.336 --> 14:53.972
Okay, you go see Emma at the bar.

14:54.072 --> 14:56.096
She'll hear you out.

15:17.762 --> 15:19.398
Back from the dead.

15:19.698 --> 15:22.702
Oh, yeah? I look that bad?

15:23.532 --> 15:25.436
Grab a seat.

15:26.739 --> 15:29.007
I'm glad to see you alive, man.

15:29.107 --> 15:32.644
- You didn't think I'd make it?
- No, not at all.

15:32.744 --> 15:35.970
I'm glad you did. It's been a long time.

15:41.368 --> 15:43.980
I came back to find out who killed Sherri.

15:47.292 --> 15:50.395
I got a guy in the D.A.'s office.
Helps me out with all my legal crap.

15:50.495 --> 15:53.299
- I can ask what's going on.
- No, no. Don't even bother.

15:54.399 --> 15:58.837
- What do you know about Club M?
- Not much. The owner.

15:58.937 --> 16:02.675
- <i>He and Sherri were shacked up for a while.</i>
- <i>You mean Kipling?</i>

16:02.775 --> 16:04.997
<i>I saw him with Olivia tonight.</i>

16:06.478 --> 16:09.681
- I guess he moves quick.
- Were Sherri and Olivia still tight?

16:09.881 --> 16:12.339
Oh, yeah, best friends 'til the end.

16:18.789 --> 16:20.405
Hey.

16:20.505 --> 16:22.649
Who else knows you're back?

16:43.914 --> 16:46.785
Your Gunner boy, Wyatt, he's back in town.

16:47.285 --> 16:49.143
Is that right?

16:53.607 --> 16:55.193
Aldo?

16:55.293 --> 16:56.995
What's up?

16:57.095 --> 16:59.126
Find Wyatt?

17:04.502 --> 17:05.859
He's gotta pay.

17:19.284 --> 17:21.386
- What the... come on.
- Postal service.

17:21.486 --> 17:23.356
Wyatt.

17:24.256 --> 17:27.459
Why you been dodging me? Yeah.

17:27.959 --> 17:31.163
- See, I own this kid. He owes me.
- Oh, yeah?

17:31.263 --> 17:34.867
And I take great pleasure
in fully possessing what's mine.

17:35.467 --> 17:38.974
Treat it how I want to treat it.
Mistreat it. Trick-or-treat it.

17:39.074 --> 17:42.295
- I'll show you exactly what you own.
- What, bitch?

17:44.208 --> 17:45.745
Yeah.

17:46.745 --> 17:49.672
Now you see how I did that?
I slapped him with the left hand...

17:49.772 --> 17:52.766
...because I had the right hand
ready to go with the 45.

17:53.618 --> 17:56.067
Multi-tasking on that ass.

17:56.655 --> 17:58.690
What, you wanna do somethin'?

17:58.790 --> 18:00.900
You wanna do somethin' right now?

18:01.280 --> 18:04.417
You want housekeeping cleaning brains
all off these damn walls?

18:08.099 --> 18:11.168
I'm just messin' with you, man,
I'm not gonna shoot you up in here.

18:13.171 --> 18:17.145
He all emotional. His sister just died.

18:17.460 --> 18:21.368
Yeah, got him bent all outta shape.
She was fine, too.

18:22.947 --> 18:25.357
But you know I don't care
about that though, right?

18:25.457 --> 18:29.021
'Cause people die every day.
Don't they, Wyatt?

18:29.121 --> 18:30.809
Whatever, man.

18:31.489 --> 18:33.558
You know what?

18:33.658 --> 18:37.996
I'm somewhere else right now.
I'm here for business, alright?

18:38.396 --> 18:42.901
You are gonna find for us the Sandman.

18:43.501 --> 18:47.605
- Who's the Sandman?
- He's got the pills with the shooting stars.

18:47.705 --> 18:50.475
I don't know. But I know his taxes are due.

18:50.575 --> 18:53.945
Anybody wanna do business
in these streets they got to pay me.

18:54.245 --> 18:56.481
Everybody pays me.

18:56.581 --> 19:00.902
But you already know that.
So you gonna find this son of a bitch.

19:01.002 --> 19:03.059
Time to pay your debt.

19:13.197 --> 19:16.055
<i>He's got the pills with the shooting stars.</i>

19:26.127 --> 19:28.902
- Are you stalking me?
- I was invited back, believe it or not.

19:30.782 --> 19:33.959
- Daddy's girl?
- What of it?

19:34.059 --> 19:38.023
Well, he may have told me
that you're in charge of the dancers.

19:38.123 --> 19:41.557
- We don't have any openings.
- Why? Because I was friends with Sherri?

19:42.978 --> 19:45.215
You heard what happened, right?

19:47.565 --> 19:49.367
I'm sorry.

19:49.467 --> 19:51.503
Am I interrupting?

19:52.103 --> 19:54.072
- Liam, this is...
- We met last night.

19:54.172 --> 19:55.851
- Yeah.
- Wyatt.

19:56.641 --> 19:59.611
5:30 tomorrow. Be here.

19:59.711 --> 20:02.803
- It's a date.
- It's an audition.

20:09.353 --> 20:11.690
What's a club, really?

20:11.790 --> 20:16.261
It's an empty warehouse.
But if you add the right music...

20:16.361 --> 20:18.363
...thank you, Liam...

20:18.763 --> 20:20.632
...people want to come party.

20:20.932 --> 20:23.635
'Cause this life is an addiction...

20:23.735 --> 20:26.591
...and we need to get them hooked...

20:26.691 --> 20:28.075
...on you.

20:28.175 --> 20:31.339
So now let's see how you freestyle.

20:31.910 --> 20:35.302
So come on. Try to impress me.

22:17.181 --> 22:19.751
- We're hiring you.
- Cool.

22:19.851 --> 22:22.020
Something to drink?

22:22.120 --> 22:25.935
Well, first you take a drink,
and the drink takes a drink...

22:26.035 --> 22:28.260
...then the drink takes you.

22:28.660 --> 22:30.896
F. Scott Fitzgerald.

22:31.596 --> 22:33.598
Is that something you do?

22:33.698 --> 22:36.619
Quote famous authors
and pretend it's original?

22:37.168 --> 22:39.438
You get away with that?

22:39.938 --> 22:41.995
Usually I do, yeah.

22:44.108 --> 22:47.679
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

22:47.779 --> 22:50.015
Was there any drama with Sherri?

22:52.318 --> 22:54.127
Not really. No.

22:54.227 --> 22:56.921
How long was she dating your dad?

22:57.021 --> 23:00.634
- Was she your girlfriend?
- No. Nothing like that, it's just...

23:01.258 --> 23:05.265
...it just bothers me, you know? It doesn't
seem like anybody's trying to solve her case.

23:07.165 --> 23:09.267
Leave it to the professionals, right?

23:09.367 --> 23:11.736
I mean, if I could find any, I would.

23:11.836 --> 23:14.506
Well, then, Detective...

23:15.006 --> 23:19.544
...Sherri and my dad ended things,
I don't know, three months ago?

23:19.644 --> 23:21.346
I think it was mutual.

23:21.446 --> 23:24.983
Was she working here that night?
The night when she was killed?

23:25.683 --> 23:29.020
She didn't finish her shift,
but... she was here, yeah.

23:29.120 --> 23:32.657
I mean, do you have any idea
why she didn't finish her shift?

23:32.757 --> 23:36.328
Look, I don't know.
I generally don't ask questions.

23:36.728 --> 23:40.765
But I know she was moody after they split.

23:40.865 --> 23:42.689
It was toxic.

23:48.371 --> 23:50.130
What's up, Wyatt?

23:54.511 --> 23:56.370
Time to talk.

24:01.585 --> 24:03.443
Come here!

24:20.838 --> 24:22.807
Shit! Stop! Stop!

24:22.907 --> 24:25.540
Stop! Gunner wants to see you.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.914
Was Sherri working for Gunner?

24:30.214 --> 24:31.805
Yeah.

24:50.734 --> 24:54.576
<i>Time is a circle, and here I am.</i>

24:54.676 --> 24:56.681
<i>Back where I started.</i>

25:06.985 --> 25:08.853
<i>I still smell it.</i>

25:09.353 --> 25:11.389
<i>The smell of death.</i>

25:11.589 --> 25:14.776
- <i>Next door in room 14.</i>
- Stop, stop! Wait!

25:14.876 --> 25:16.884
<i>My mom died in that room.</i>

25:38.632 --> 25:40.190
Here.

25:43.587 --> 25:46.191
Everyone, please can you gather 'round?

25:46.941 --> 25:50.261
I have detective Childers, or Childers?

25:50.361 --> 25:52.697
- Childers.
- And what's your name again, darling?

25:52.797 --> 25:57.058
- Detective Lewis, homicide.
- Detective Lewis from homicide.

25:57.876 --> 26:03.374
They've come to ask us a few questions
about our... our darling Sherri.

26:03.474 --> 26:06.344
So please help them out as much as you can.

26:06.444 --> 26:09.163
You. Head of security?

26:09.263 --> 26:11.466
- Yeah.
- Alright, let's take a walk.

26:11.566 --> 26:14.191
- For what?
- Bould.

26:21.351 --> 26:23.017
Take a seat.

26:23.728 --> 26:26.698
- Are you asking me or are you telling me?
- Sit down.

26:27.398 --> 26:29.223
Sit down.

26:37.541 --> 26:42.098
Were you... were you working
the night that Sherilyn disappeared?

26:44.182 --> 26:46.520
- It's a simple question, yes or no. Were...
- Yes.

26:46.620 --> 26:48.662
Yes. Good.

27:32.262 --> 27:34.354
<i>A gold plated nine.</i>

27:44.675 --> 27:46.945
<i>Commercial sale agreement.</i>

27:47.345 --> 27:50.637
<i>He's selling the club to James Donovan.</i>

28:12.235 --> 28:13.931
So...

28:14.716 --> 28:17.653
...what can I do for you, Detective?

28:20.444 --> 28:23.315
You and... Sherilyn.

28:24.115 --> 28:26.818
You were in an ongoing relationship, right?

28:27.318 --> 28:29.187
That is correct.

28:29.687 --> 28:31.223
Well...

28:32.523 --> 28:35.894
...I did some research on you.

28:36.794 --> 28:38.447
And...

28:39.883 --> 28:43.930
...I found some troubling photos.

28:49.372 --> 28:51.209
This one's my favorite.

28:51.909 --> 28:53.712
Oh, my.

28:54.612 --> 28:57.082
I can assure you, Detective...

28:57.682 --> 29:00.119
...these were all totally consensual...

29:01.519 --> 29:03.470
...because...

29:03.570 --> 29:06.804
...that's what she enjoyed.

29:07.591 --> 29:09.828
Really? 'Cause...

29:10.628 --> 29:13.520
...she doesn't look like
she's enjoying that too much.

29:14.465 --> 29:16.868
That's just how she was.

29:17.568 --> 29:21.831
Wasn't quite right in the head.
She had a few screws loose.

29:23.407 --> 29:25.645
Where did you get those pictures from?

29:27.995 --> 29:29.855
I have friends.

29:31.482 --> 29:33.417
Oh, yeah?

29:33.517 --> 29:35.776
And who might they be?

29:35.876 --> 29:38.887
- Let me go!
- Calm down.

29:41.592 --> 29:43.060
Olivia!

29:43.160 --> 29:45.169
Play nice!

29:46.704 --> 29:50.756
- I need you to calm down.
- Let me go!

29:56.139 --> 30:00.044
Hey! Everybody calm down!
Everybody calm down! Relax, step away.

30:00.144 --> 30:02.246
Take a deep breath. Relax. Relax.

30:02.346 --> 30:05.216
No one's accusing you of anything. Calm down.

30:05.316 --> 30:09.287
Excuse me.
I think it's time for you two to leave.

30:09.987 --> 30:12.290
Need anything? Contact my attorney.

30:12.390 --> 30:15.432
- We will.
- Thank you. I have your card.

30:18.161 --> 30:20.832
- You okay, baby?
- Yeah.

30:21.532 --> 30:23.034
Crazy.

30:23.134 --> 30:25.670
- You alright?
- Yeah, you missed the show.

30:25.770 --> 30:27.889
Where did you just come from?

30:27.989 --> 30:30.142
I was in the restroom.

30:35.245 --> 30:38.839
- Sure you're okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:50.243 --> 30:52.681
<i>Who is James Donovan?</i>

30:53.881 --> 30:56.684
<i>Rich kid, playboy, drug addict.</i>

30:56.784 --> 30:59.003
<i>This kid's dad built Vegas.</i>

30:59.503 --> 31:04.717
<i>He started 20 years ago still in high school,
having huge festivals on daddy's dime.</i>

31:06.644 --> 31:09.333
<i>Inspired by how they stripped
Times Square of all personality...</i>

31:09.433 --> 31:11.808
<i>...and made it a marketing gold mine.</i>

31:13.417 --> 31:17.688
<i>His current obsession is to turn
downtown LA into an EDM destination.</i>

31:17.788 --> 31:19.590
<i>A club kid Mecca.</i>

31:19.690 --> 31:24.628
<i>Bring in the huddled masses of ravers and
push out the homeless, clean up the streets.</i>

31:24.728 --> 31:29.212
<i>Create the Disneyland of clubs.
The happiest place on Earth.</i>

31:29.700 --> 31:32.670
<i>Spring awakening in Chicago,
Euphoria in Texas,</i>

31:32.770 --> 31:36.462
<i>Electric Daisy Carnival in Vegas,
Lucidity in LA.</i>

31:38.375 --> 31:41.236
<i>There's so much money to be made.</i>

31:57.494 --> 32:00.297
<i>Wyatt? It's me, Olivia. Meet me at the pier.</i>

32:00.397 --> 32:02.855
<i>11 am. You know where.</i>

32:13.543 --> 32:16.347
- What's up, O?
- Did anybody follow you here?

32:16.447 --> 32:19.851
No, I checked. I promise.

32:20.451 --> 32:22.954
How come you didn't call
or write when you were away?

32:23.054 --> 32:26.590
How come you never came to see me?
You didn't think to visit?

32:26.690 --> 32:30.916
Maybe an invitation would have been nice.
It's a two-way street, Wyatt.

32:33.997 --> 32:36.801
I didn't tell Kipling
that you were Sherilyn's brother.

32:36.901 --> 32:40.137
I don't know how long you're gonna
be able to keep up that lie.

32:40.237 --> 32:43.407
You're putting me
in a very compromising situation.

32:43.507 --> 32:45.743
Yeah, I understand that.

32:46.343 --> 32:48.946
If he finds out he'll probably kill us both.

32:49.046 --> 32:51.001
Think so?

32:51.101 --> 32:53.184
I know so.

32:53.384 --> 32:57.093
- Did he kill Sherri?
- I honestly don't know.

32:58.522 --> 33:00.392
Why would he?

33:01.592 --> 33:06.064
- Hey, I don't have time for these games.
- Let me go or I'll start screaming.

33:06.864 --> 33:10.601
I loved Sherri.
There were a lot of things I didn't know.

33:10.701 --> 33:12.939
Now I'm in way over my head.

33:18.391 --> 33:20.628
Here's the key to Sherri's apartment.

33:21.378 --> 33:23.458
I wrote her address on the tag.

33:24.081 --> 33:27.540
If you ever cared about me
you'll keep this meeting a secret.

34:09.659 --> 34:11.463
Turn around.

34:11.963 --> 34:14.634
Slowly. Real slow.

34:18.134 --> 34:19.704
Wyatt?

34:20.603 --> 34:22.639
Oh, my God.

34:23.804 --> 34:25.340
Wyatt.

34:26.630 --> 34:28.379
Look at you.

34:28.478 --> 34:30.509
You came back.

34:31.449 --> 34:33.885
Val, you sure grew up while I was gone.

34:33.985 --> 34:36.809
You're here for Sherri's stuff, aren't you?

34:42.559 --> 34:46.429
<i>Sherri's Bible.
The club scene's four commandments.</i>

34:46.530 --> 34:51.601
<i>Peace, love, unity and respect.</i>

34:51.702 --> 34:53.804
<i>Sherri went to that church.</i>

34:53.904 --> 34:56.195
<i>It was her escape from real life.</i>

35:00.810 --> 35:02.694
Looks like she found a preacher.

35:10.253 --> 35:11.478
Donovan?

35:18.128 --> 35:20.197
You know how they met?

35:20.597 --> 35:23.017
She worked at Resurgence.

35:23.117 --> 35:25.119
That's Donovan's club.

35:25.219 --> 35:27.605
I think he gave her that job.

35:28.239 --> 35:30.513
So she was cheating on Kipling.

36:55.459 --> 36:59.029
- Back up.
- Come on, man. Let me talk to Donovan.

36:59.129 --> 37:00.966
Keep walking.

37:02.366 --> 37:05.061
Tell Donovan that Sherri says hi.

37:07.137 --> 37:08.995
I'll wait.

37:12.342 --> 37:13.913
Hold on.

37:18.698 --> 37:21.369
There's a guy out there asking for Sherri.

37:22.219 --> 37:25.345
- Stop, Donovan!
- Sit down.

37:36.666 --> 37:39.670
- Who are you?
- The name's Wyatt.

37:40.370 --> 37:42.373
What do you want, Wyatt?

37:42.773 --> 37:46.010
I was friends with Sherri.
Heard you were, too.

37:46.610 --> 37:48.168
Yeah.

37:50.380 --> 37:52.784
You and Sherri were pretty close?

37:53.284 --> 37:56.623
She impressed me. Not many do.

37:59.223 --> 38:02.560
Hey, do you know,
was there any drama going on with her?

38:02.660 --> 38:06.965
You know, anybody threatening her
or anything like that?

38:08.465 --> 38:12.871
You knew her. She wasn't exactly
the easiest person to get along with.

38:14.071 --> 38:16.174
Sherri's way or the highway.

38:16.874 --> 38:19.058
I don't really know what she was into.
I mean...

38:19.158 --> 38:22.446
...I assumed she was dealing here
but I didn't care.

38:22.546 --> 38:24.381
I didn't take a cut.

38:24.481 --> 38:26.703
It's not part of my plan, you know?

38:26.984 --> 38:28.901
But I know it goes on.

38:30.221 --> 38:32.825
Do you know why anybody
would want to hurt her?

38:34.325 --> 38:35.849
No.

38:40.597 --> 38:42.448
Look, man...

38:43.018 --> 38:45.303
...that's what it's all about, right?

38:47.337 --> 38:49.940
I really vibe off this whole...

38:50.040 --> 38:53.715
...peace, love, unity,
respect mantra, you know?

38:55.478 --> 38:57.306
It's a beautiful thing.

38:58.782 --> 39:01.842
This is their age of Aquarius.

39:02.820 --> 39:05.122
It's about a shared experience, you know?

39:05.522 --> 39:09.610
I feel it's up to me to broaden
that opportunity. Share it with everybody.

39:10.060 --> 39:13.198
One club at a time. You feel me?

39:14.098 --> 39:17.222
It kinda feels like the McDonald's
of EDM to be honest.

39:17.322 --> 39:20.423
Why not? I want a billion served.

39:21.272 --> 39:23.095
Excuse me.

39:38.489 --> 39:41.275
I desire the things
that will destroy me in the end.

39:41.375 --> 39:43.344
Yeah, that makes two of us.

39:43.444 --> 39:46.463
You know that quote?
You don't know that quote.

39:46.563 --> 39:49.366
Maybe. I might.

39:49.766 --> 39:51.902
Nah. I got you.

39:52.002 --> 39:55.394
Alright. So the tables have turned.

40:56.298 --> 40:59.603
- What's up?
- Do you want a drink?

40:59.703 --> 41:01.238
No, I'm good. Thanks.

41:01.338 --> 41:05.943
It's all about pills, thrills, to the beat.

41:06.043 --> 41:07.912
I'm at work.

41:08.612 --> 41:10.681
The boy's a professional.

41:11.031 --> 41:12.838
I like that.

41:13.867 --> 41:16.025
You put that over there, baby.

41:18.754 --> 41:20.459
Next, please.

41:26.529 --> 41:28.554
Let's go and chat.

41:39.175 --> 41:42.039
I just want you to come with me for a second.

41:47.184 --> 41:49.275
You gotta check this out.

41:59.529 --> 42:02.622
- Take your clothes off.
- What?

42:05.903 --> 42:09.940
I said take all your clothes off...

42:10.040 --> 42:12.298
...and give them to Bould.

42:34.897 --> 42:37.721
- Is he clean?
- He's not wired.

42:37.821 --> 42:40.138
Is this how you treat all your new employees?

42:41.138 --> 42:43.429
Don't act stupid, boy.

42:46.943 --> 42:52.182
You come into my club, you start
asking questions about drugs...

42:52.282 --> 42:54.552
...asking questions about Sherri.

42:55.352 --> 42:57.922
Then you go snooping around my office.

42:59.022 --> 43:02.293
Yeah, I knew about that.

43:03.193 --> 43:05.696
And now I've got all this heat on me.

43:06.296 --> 43:08.331
And I can't operate.

43:08.431 --> 43:10.580
'Cause your fool friend...

43:10.680 --> 43:12.178
...got herself killed...

43:12.278 --> 43:14.765
...'cause she played me...

43:14.865 --> 43:17.346
...and everyone else who cared about her.

43:18.258 --> 43:20.061
Let me in.

43:20.711 --> 43:22.801
Find out what she wants.

43:25.448 --> 43:27.440
- What you want?
- Get out of the way.

43:33.939 --> 43:35.492
Kipling, really?

43:35.592 --> 43:39.743
This is a legitimate business.
There's better ways to check your employees.

43:39.843 --> 43:43.400
Honey. I've got a possible situation here.

43:43.500 --> 43:47.161
You promised me next level...

43:47.875 --> 43:50.496
...not gutter trash.

43:51.274 --> 43:53.343
You're better than this.

43:53.643 --> 43:55.946
We're better than this.

43:56.046 --> 43:58.682
So give the boy his clothes.

43:58.782 --> 44:00.351
Let's go.

44:00.651 --> 44:02.942
Bould, give the boy his pants.

44:07.256 --> 44:08.759
Come on.

44:08.859 --> 44:10.482
Fetch.

44:11.661 --> 44:13.195
Hey.

44:15.248 --> 44:17.006
Back to work.

44:29.513 --> 44:31.682
Hey, where are you going?

44:32.666 --> 44:36.128
I was gonna take off a little early if that's
okay. I'm not feeling that well.

44:36.228 --> 44:40.957
- Of course. Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Just... a headache.

44:41.057 --> 44:44.211
I'm sorry. What're you doing tomorrow?

44:45.696 --> 44:47.698
Whatever you want me to do.

44:48.198 --> 44:50.901
Pick me up at noon and I'll text you where.

44:51.301 --> 44:52.712
It's a date.

45:06.215 --> 45:08.785
I've wanted to do that
since the first time we met.

45:08.885 --> 45:10.954
I thought you had a headache.

45:11.054 --> 45:12.823
You made me forget about it.

45:13.223 --> 45:14.858
See you at noon?

45:14.958 --> 45:16.982
See you at noon.

45:32.975 --> 45:35.345
<i>No matter how far you get...</i>

45:35.445 --> 45:38.327
<i>...your past is always one step behind you.</i>

45:47.023 --> 45:49.493
Looks like you're moving up in the world.

45:49.693 --> 45:52.930
What do they call you now? The Sandman?

45:53.430 --> 45:56.467
The Sandman? That ain't me.

45:56.967 --> 45:59.180
Who told you that?

45:59.280 --> 46:01.930
Nobody. Just, you know...

46:02.030 --> 46:05.709
...they say the Sandman's product
is everywhere so I figured it was you.

46:05.809 --> 46:07.779
What, you tryin' to be a smart ass?

46:09.079 --> 46:10.836
Not at all.

46:13.883 --> 46:15.940
You owe me.

46:19.221 --> 46:21.358
Man, when I left we were square.

46:21.458 --> 46:25.047
It ain't about you. It's about Sherri.

46:25.147 --> 46:26.997
What'd she do?

46:27.097 --> 46:29.354
You know she did something, right?

46:34.036 --> 46:36.273
I packed you 1000 atoms.

46:36.973 --> 46:39.776
- 1000?
- It'll put a dent in her debt.

46:39.876 --> 46:42.601
A dent? Man, what did she do?

46:44.947 --> 46:48.852
She stole some pills, man. A lot of pills.

46:48.952 --> 46:51.888
I need 100% of everything you make...

46:51.988 --> 46:54.257
...at $30 a pill.

46:54.357 --> 46:56.406
You owe me 30 grand.

46:56.506 --> 46:58.583
30 grand.

47:01.430 --> 47:02.988
Go.

47:12.825 --> 47:14.028
Wyatt.

47:18.631 --> 47:20.668
Bring back my money.

47:21.318 --> 47:24.555
<i>If Sherri stole over 1000 pills
from Gunner...</i>

47:24.655 --> 47:27.725
<i>...he would have definitely
sent Aldo to find her.</i>

47:28.925 --> 47:32.219
<i>Fresh out of rehab
and I'm back to pushing pills.</i>

47:47.426 --> 47:49.530
You had these before?

47:50.080 --> 47:54.117
<i>The game is always the same.
The streets are always changing.</i>

47:54.517 --> 47:57.788
<i>You stay away too long, you come back...</i>

47:57.888 --> 47:59.923
<i>...you could get lost.</i>

48:00.023 --> 48:02.281
<i>Nothing feels familiar anymore.</i>

48:06.929 --> 48:09.166
<i>The Sandman is a ghost.</i>

48:09.566 --> 48:13.438
<i>Everyone's heard of him
but no one's seen him.</i>

48:15.138 --> 48:17.307
Hey. Sandman?

48:17.407 --> 48:19.443
Lookin' for Sandman.

48:20.743 --> 48:22.367
Yeah?

48:29.234 --> 48:31.493
So you got some of that Sandman molly?

48:33.589 --> 48:35.658
Yeah, I might.

48:35.758 --> 48:38.328
I was gonna ask you the same question.

48:38.428 --> 48:42.732
Aight. How much you want for them?
You know, I got cash, you know?

48:42.832 --> 48:44.935
Nah, man.

48:45.035 --> 48:47.237
- We got a problem?
- No.

48:47.337 --> 48:49.472
Come on, man.

48:49.572 --> 48:53.131
No, we're cool, man.
Alright, I'll sell to you.

48:54.944 --> 48:58.214
- Alright.
- I only got a few of the Sandman's though.

48:58.314 --> 49:00.851
You know, I'm actually looking
for that connection. You know him?

49:00.951 --> 49:04.021
No, I don't know the connect
but you got 'em, right?

49:04.421 --> 49:07.240
I'll take 'em off you.
How much you want for 'em?

49:08.058 --> 49:10.694
- 30 a pop.
- Aight.

49:10.994 --> 49:14.164
You got three? There's 100 right here.

49:14.264 --> 49:17.154
Right here. Thank you.

49:19.634 --> 49:22.172
Hey, boss. Turn around. Watch me.

49:22.272 --> 49:24.596
You see this? You see me?
Hands behind your back.

49:24.696 --> 49:27.365
Turn around, turn around. No, no, no.

49:27.465 --> 49:30.812
- Hands behind... hands behind your back!
- Yeah, I got it!

49:37.453 --> 49:40.345
You done got yourself locked up.

49:45.761 --> 49:47.798
Hey, dumbass.

49:48.798 --> 49:51.601
Now I told you to find the Sandman...

49:51.701 --> 49:53.704
...not sell his product.

49:54.304 --> 49:56.506
So you're working for him too?

49:56.806 --> 50:00.444
- Nah, man.
- You're tryin' to get that money, ain't you?

50:02.345 --> 50:04.547
Where you get the pills from, boy?

50:04.647 --> 50:06.994
They were Sherri's stash.
I was following up on a lead...

50:07.094 --> 50:09.528
You know, you're a real piece of work.

50:10.486 --> 50:14.024
I get the D.A. to knock years
off your sentence.

50:14.124 --> 50:15.659
Years.

50:16.209 --> 50:19.396
Under the condition
you come work and be my bitch.

50:19.496 --> 50:22.963
But now you got me feelin'
like I need a new bitch.

50:23.633 --> 50:25.856
I don't wanna get a new bitch.

50:26.736 --> 50:30.976
Did you think it was easy
to acquire what I did for you?

50:32.574 --> 50:34.945
- No.
- No.

50:35.045 --> 50:37.680
Then why are you tryin' to play me then?

50:37.780 --> 50:41.484
You got me feelin' really unappreciated, man.

50:41.584 --> 50:43.674
But... but here...

50:43.920 --> 50:45.740
Shut up.

50:46.289 --> 50:48.024
Look here.

50:48.124 --> 50:50.802
You got 48 hours...

50:50.902 --> 50:53.343
...or I'm sending your ass to prison.

50:53.443 --> 50:56.011
Not rehab. Prison.

50:56.111 --> 51:00.859
And I'll put the word out that you
was a snitch. Nobody likes a snitch.

51:01.771 --> 51:03.506
- You'll be dead in a week.
- Come on, man...

51:03.606 --> 51:05.476
No, you come on!

51:06.476 --> 51:08.611
So you think I'm playin'?

51:08.711 --> 51:10.881
I ain't playin' with you, boy.

51:11.381 --> 51:15.072
You ain't on your time no more.
You're on mine.

51:15.918 --> 51:18.790
You got 48 hours.

51:20.290 --> 51:22.292
And that's all you got.

51:22.892 --> 51:24.749
Tick-tock.

51:26.462 --> 51:29.299
Here, don't forget your hat.

51:29.399 --> 51:31.223
Stupid ass.

52:22.890 --> 52:24.821
Hi. You came.

52:24.921 --> 52:28.959
- And you're surprised.
- Actually, yes.

52:29.659 --> 52:31.976
You're fantastic.

52:32.076 --> 52:33.730
Thanks.

52:34.330 --> 52:36.830
- I'm nervous.
- For our date?

52:36.930 --> 52:39.669
No, silly. I'm not scared of you.

52:39.769 --> 52:42.706
I'm auditioning for the ODC in San Francisco.

52:42.806 --> 52:47.311
It's this modern dance school,
and I'm a wreck.

52:48.811 --> 52:51.015
So where are we going?

52:52.815 --> 52:56.820
Well, I mean, I was thinking
we could... we could go...

52:57.120 --> 52:59.241
Okay, how about this? I'm gonna go change...

52:59.341 --> 53:02.432
...while you think of something
awesome for us to do.

53:03.393 --> 53:04.997
Alright.

53:07.197 --> 53:08.487
Bye.

53:40.730 --> 53:43.399
- That's Wyatt, yo.
- It's Wyatt.

53:43.499 --> 53:45.101
You know, we got a joke for you.

53:45.201 --> 53:47.804
Something about the guy that goes ghost
on his neighborhood for years.

53:47.904 --> 53:51.307
- What's the punchline?
- We were hoping you'd tell us.

53:51.407 --> 53:54.325
I had the unfortunate fate
of growing up with these kids.

53:55.045 --> 53:58.336
Don't be a stranger, Wy.
Some people still miss you out here.

54:02.150 --> 54:04.821
Sunday in San Francisco.

54:04.921 --> 54:08.725
My dad doesn't know about it.
He'd literally kill me.

54:09.325 --> 54:11.527
You know, you're seriously good, Emma.

54:11.627 --> 54:13.948
Just don't tell my dad I'm auditioning.

54:15.598 --> 54:17.700
Everybody's afraid of your dad?

54:17.800 --> 54:20.036
Yeah, that's Pops.

54:20.136 --> 54:23.106
Yeah, I'm probably not gonna get in anyways.

54:23.206 --> 54:26.709
- Those dancers are really incredible.
- I hear San Francisco is pretty epic.

54:26.809 --> 54:29.412
- You haven't been?
- No.

54:29.512 --> 54:32.949
I heard that every day there's a farmer's
market in a different part of town.

54:33.049 --> 54:35.318
Every day, fresh fruit.

54:35.818 --> 54:40.224
You know there are...
lots of hills in San Francisco.

54:41.224 --> 54:44.416
Cute fact. That's true, that is true.

54:48.230 --> 54:50.900
- Sylvia Plath, by the way.
- What?

54:51.000 --> 54:53.008
Your quote from the other night.

54:53.108 --> 54:56.372
"I desire the things that
will destroy me in the end".

54:56.472 --> 54:59.342
- You definitely googled that, didn't you?
- No, I don't Google.

55:00.092 --> 55:01.950
You googled it.

55:05.013 --> 55:06.651
Maybe.

55:08.301 --> 55:10.882
So do you think you're gonna
destroy me in the end?

55:11.504 --> 55:13.395
Most likely.

55:15.290 --> 55:16.886
So...

55:18.480 --> 55:20.927
...does that mean that you desire me?

56:24.192 --> 56:26.529
I think I could get used to this bed.

56:26.629 --> 56:28.519
Oh, really?

56:29.932 --> 56:32.350
I mean, even without you in it.

56:34.203 --> 56:36.072
Motel bed's rough?

56:36.572 --> 56:38.577
It's a beast.

56:41.878 --> 56:44.780
Do you want to go out with me and my friends?

56:44.880 --> 56:47.416
We wanna go to Resurgence tomorrow night.

56:47.516 --> 56:50.721
Saturdays are wild. Like Vegas.

56:51.721 --> 56:55.157
Besides, my dad likes
to show us off at other clubs...

56:55.257 --> 56:59.328
...especially Donovan's,
so he always pays for a table.

56:59.428 --> 57:01.664
The other dancers love it.

57:02.264 --> 57:04.467
Yeah, maybe.

57:04.867 --> 57:08.176
I've just... got some stuff to take care of.

57:09.738 --> 57:11.326
Please?

57:11.926 --> 57:14.649
I really wanna hang out
with you before I leave.

57:16.662 --> 57:19.269
You really want out of LA, don't you?

57:23.369 --> 57:25.920
But the thing about my dad is...

57:27.657 --> 57:30.461
...he doesn't let the things he loves go.

57:31.761 --> 57:33.784
Not really.

57:46.041 --> 57:47.865
I gotta run.

58:17.122 --> 58:18.747
Sorry.

58:24.880 --> 58:27.918
- What's that all about?
- Another runaway.

58:28.868 --> 58:31.137
Mom's down looking everywhere.

58:31.237 --> 58:33.440
Second time she's come down this week.

58:34.540 --> 58:38.678
- Same as it ever was?
- Look, Kipling wants to see you.

58:38.778 --> 58:40.368
Now.

58:47.602 --> 58:48.842
Wyatt?

58:53.208 --> 58:57.513
Didn't I tell you to keep
your hands off my daughter?

58:57.613 --> 59:01.680
Your dirty little maggot hands.

59:10.759 --> 59:13.604
See, the thing is...

59:14.964 --> 59:17.795
...Emma is my prized possession.

59:21.270 --> 59:23.362
She's my trophy.

59:25.208 --> 59:28.379
She's in a glass case.

59:29.079 --> 59:31.848
And I hold the keys.

59:31.948 --> 59:34.285
She's 24 carat.

59:37.286 --> 59:39.123
Do you hear me?

59:40.323 --> 59:43.588
In what world do you think...

59:43.688 --> 59:47.016
...you could ever have my Emma?

59:47.116 --> 59:50.743
You touch her again, you get near her...

59:50.843 --> 59:53.344
...and I'll come lose it on you.

59:53.503 --> 59:56.639
I will smash your kneecaps...

59:56.739 --> 59:59.289
...and then we'll see how you jump around.

59:59.809 --> 01:00:01.720
Hear me?

01:00:16.157 --> 01:00:18.037
By the way...

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.316
...you're fired.

01:00:24.299 --> 01:00:26.368
Clean that shit up.

01:00:27.303 --> 01:00:28.960
Cupcake.

01:00:47.622 --> 01:00:50.314
Get out of here
before you get yourself killed.

01:01:18.687 --> 01:01:21.490
<i>Sherri was at Club M the night she died.</i>

01:01:21.590 --> 01:01:24.860
<i>Bullet in the head then burned on Skid Row.</i>

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:27.229
<i>She was in a relationship with Kipling...</i>

01:01:27.329 --> 01:01:30.039
<i>...then sparked a relationship with Donovan.</i>

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.122
<i>She had been living with Val
the whole time pushing drugs for Gunner.</i>

01:01:36.972 --> 01:01:39.777
<i>She was also dealing for the Sandman.</i>

01:01:41.177 --> 01:01:43.580
<i>We know Kipling has a temper.</i>

01:01:44.580 --> 01:01:46.883
<i>As evidenced by my face.</i>

01:01:47.483 --> 01:01:49.685
<i>He was also in severe financial trouble...</i>

01:01:49.785 --> 01:01:52.922
<i>...potentially being forced
to sell his club to Donovan.</i>

01:01:53.522 --> 01:01:55.858
<i>Sherri was sleeping with Donovan...</i>

01:01:55.958 --> 01:01:59.161
<i>...and with Kipling's proclivity
to possession...</i>

01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:02.186
<i>...I don't think
that would have gone over well.</i>

01:02:16.345 --> 01:02:19.182
Oh, my God. I heard.

01:02:20.082 --> 01:02:22.351
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:02:22.451 --> 01:02:24.675
Seems par for the course.

01:02:27.756 --> 01:02:30.404
My dad's an asshole. I'm sorry.

01:02:30.504 --> 01:02:34.518
But I promise to make you feel
much better tonight.

01:05:14.005 --> 01:05:16.214
You're Sherri's brother, aren't you?

01:05:17.493 --> 01:05:20.190
Yeah. My name's Wyatt.

01:05:20.290 --> 01:05:23.499
Yeah, I know. She talked a lot about you.

01:05:24.199 --> 01:05:26.437
You have the same eyes.

01:05:28.287 --> 01:05:30.506
So you guys were close?

01:05:32.499 --> 01:05:34.043
Yeah.

01:05:34.643 --> 01:05:37.667
She had a thing for me.

01:05:40.516 --> 01:05:44.480
I thought she was cute, so we hooked up.

01:05:45.387 --> 01:05:49.634
I mean, it didn't last long,
but we stayed friends.

01:05:50.225 --> 01:05:52.078
She introduced me to Donovan.

01:05:52.428 --> 01:05:54.497
That guy's a monster.

01:05:55.397 --> 01:05:57.466
What do you mean?

01:05:57.566 --> 01:05:59.902
I mean he beat her ass.

01:06:00.802 --> 01:06:03.839
She told me that he had her
under some kind of contract.

01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:06.241
What kind of contract?

01:06:06.341 --> 01:06:08.410
Alright, let me... let me backtrack.

01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:13.048
So Sherri met another club owner, Kipling,
a few months after you went away.

01:06:13.148 --> 01:06:16.886
At that time she was down and out,
living on the streets, you know?

01:06:16.986 --> 01:06:20.622
So Sherri signed a contract
that basically made her Kipling's slave.

01:06:20.722 --> 01:06:24.026
He paid a lot of money for her life.

01:06:24.126 --> 01:06:26.095
Then he sold that contract to Donovan.

01:06:26.195 --> 01:06:28.931
She signed a contract that made her a slave?

01:06:29.131 --> 01:06:32.923
Yeah, pretty much.
It happens a lot more than you think.

01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:37.339
Do you think Donovan killed Sherri?

01:06:37.439 --> 01:06:40.142
Honestly I don't know
who pulled the trigger...

01:06:40.242 --> 01:06:42.444
...but the way I see it,
it was all those assholes.

01:06:42.544 --> 01:06:45.758
Donovan, Kipling,
and that dude Gunner. My God.

01:06:45.858 --> 01:06:50.320
He kept driving her to push
those pills that she was addicted to.

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:53.561
They all put her in the ground.

01:07:03.064 --> 01:07:08.270
<i>Hey, Wyatt, it's Emma and I'm on my way
to my audition in San Francisco.</i>

01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:12.474
<i>I just wanted to make sure everything
was okay, so, give me a call back.</i>

01:07:12.574 --> 01:07:14.143
<i>Bye.</i>

01:07:14.443 --> 01:07:16.912
<i>The way I see it,
they all put her in the ground.</i>

01:07:17.012 --> 01:07:21.072
<i>Donovan, Kipling,
and that dude Gunner. My God.</i>

01:07:40.702 --> 01:07:43.419
- <i>Olivia, I need a favor.</i>
- Anything.

01:07:44.239 --> 01:07:47.709
- Where's Kipling?
- It's noon. Sleeping.

01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:51.202
I need you to meet me at the club.
And bring his keys.

01:07:54.782 --> 01:07:58.420
Alright, it should be dated the 21st,
the night of Sherri's last shift.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:01.343
I want everything after eight
from both back and front doors.

01:08:03.625 --> 01:08:07.452
Alright, there's the front door
and here's the back door.

01:08:13.935 --> 01:08:16.772
Wait. Wait, go back.

01:08:17.471 --> 01:08:20.545
Stop. Zoom in. On that guy.

01:08:23.444 --> 01:08:25.603
I know him from somewhere.

01:08:29.584 --> 01:08:31.528
I gotta blow.

01:08:31.987 --> 01:08:34.023
What about Kipling?

01:08:34.423 --> 01:08:36.279
He didn't kill her.

01:08:52.107 --> 01:08:54.143
<i>Come on, Sherri.</i>

01:08:54.243 --> 01:08:56.145
<i>You have to do it.</i>

01:08:56.245 --> 01:08:57.979
<i>Let me see.</i>

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.115
<i>Show me your neck.</i>

01:09:00.215 --> 01:09:02.018
<i>June 5th.</i>

01:09:02.618 --> 01:09:05.154
<i>James lost it for the third time.</i>

01:09:05.554 --> 01:09:07.845
<i>Last night he nearly killed me.</i>

01:09:15.162 --> 01:09:18.647
I need you to look at something for me.
In the back. Who's that?

01:09:18.747 --> 01:09:21.636
Tony. Sherri called him "The Wolf".

01:09:21.737 --> 01:09:24.206
He's been working with Donovan forever.

01:09:24.805 --> 01:09:27.470
<i>Sherri said I always did what was right.</i>

01:09:28.343 --> 01:09:31.913
<i>I would take care of everything,
tie up all the loose ends.</i>

01:09:32.264 --> 01:09:35.684
<i>That I'm different from her
because I always finish things.</i>

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.917
- Karl.
- <i>Check your email, kid.</i>

01:09:49.398 --> 01:09:51.652
I talked to my guy at the D.A.'s office, Wy.

01:09:51.752 --> 01:09:54.987
Your boy James Donovan
has a history of criminal activity.

01:09:55.337 --> 01:09:59.441
<i>Thing is he doesn't have a record. Thanks
to Daddy and a couple fat paid attorneys...</i>

01:09:59.641 --> 01:10:02.061
...he's had all the incidents expunged.

01:10:02.161 --> 01:10:04.246
What kind of incidents?

01:10:04.346 --> 01:10:06.448
<i>Violent crimes, aggravated assault.</i>

01:10:06.748 --> 01:10:09.460
The kicker is all his victims? Women.

01:10:10.043 --> 01:10:13.421
<i>Now, he's worked hard to keep all these
records sealed and for good reason.</i>

01:10:13.521 --> 01:10:16.371
<i>He has a billion dollar investor
in town this weekend from China.</i>

01:10:16.471 --> 01:10:18.538
Thank you for coming, gentlemen.

01:10:58.966 --> 01:11:01.270
So are you ready to meet the Sandman?

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:03.405
I stay ready.

01:11:03.705 --> 01:11:05.742
This better be real.

01:11:07.042 --> 01:11:08.577
Let's go.

01:11:08.677 --> 01:11:10.535
Alright, let's rock.

01:11:26.427 --> 01:11:28.163
What's up, Wyatt?

01:11:28.263 --> 01:11:30.937
Spike, can I speak to you
outside for a second?

01:11:41.109 --> 01:11:44.079
Just keep calm. Just breathe.

01:11:44.179 --> 01:11:46.215
Let me get that out ya.

01:11:46.715 --> 01:11:49.635
- See? That was good.
- Punk ass bitch.

01:11:50.185 --> 01:11:52.275
Good job, boy.

01:11:58.526 --> 01:12:00.362
Turn around.

01:12:00.462 --> 01:12:03.612
Turn around. Take a little walk.

01:12:03.712 --> 01:12:07.235
Let's go. Come on.
And don't do nothing stupid.

01:12:07.335 --> 01:12:09.160
Let's go.

01:12:15.042 --> 01:12:17.512
Sit your ass down! Don't you move!

01:12:17.612 --> 01:12:20.882
- Damn.
- Curtiz.

01:12:20.982 --> 01:12:22.685
Hands on the table.

01:12:23.285 --> 01:12:25.292
Slowly.

01:12:26.586 --> 01:12:28.946
Let's get these gentlemen some jewelry.

01:12:30.524 --> 01:12:32.516
Come on. Get your ass in there.

01:12:34.161 --> 01:12:36.999
In there. Come on!

01:12:38.099 --> 01:12:40.123
All goddamn day.

01:12:42.503 --> 01:12:45.507
Get on the ground.
Man, get your ass on the ground!

01:12:45.607 --> 01:12:47.230
You!

01:12:51.178 --> 01:12:54.015
- Where's Gunner?
- Asleep.

01:12:54.115 --> 01:12:57.582
Asleep? Wake his ass up then.

01:12:57.682 --> 01:12:59.276
Wait!

01:13:00.988 --> 01:13:02.813
Call him out.

01:13:04.492 --> 01:13:06.016
Gunner!

01:13:06.894 --> 01:13:08.485
Gunner!

01:13:10.164 --> 01:13:12.723
Get out here, man. We got company.

01:13:17.304 --> 01:13:18.896
Gunner.

01:13:21.475 --> 01:13:23.713
Gettin' some beauty rest?

01:13:24.913 --> 01:13:27.449
- What's going on, man?
- What's going on?

01:13:27.549 --> 01:13:29.721
I got a noise complaint.

01:13:29.821 --> 01:13:32.939
Now I got to run down here
and run interference.

01:13:34.789 --> 01:13:36.748
That's how you livin' now?

01:13:36.848 --> 01:13:41.112
You got the product and the cash
all out for everybody to see?

01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:44.066
My bad.

01:13:44.166 --> 01:13:45.969
Your bad.

01:13:47.469 --> 01:13:49.257
What's the gun for?

01:13:49.357 --> 01:13:51.574
We ain't friends no more?

01:13:52.274 --> 01:13:54.486
What, man? It's my house.

01:13:54.876 --> 01:13:57.045
This your house?

01:13:57.145 --> 01:14:01.188
I'm gonna need you to put the gun
on the ground. And kick it over here.

01:14:03.385 --> 01:14:07.444
You want SWAT to come kick in that
goddamn door down? Is that what you need?

01:14:14.294 --> 01:14:15.832
Good.

01:14:16.832 --> 01:14:19.101
Now who else is in the house?

01:14:20.201 --> 01:14:22.929
- Just us.
- Just us?

01:14:23.435 --> 01:14:25.053
Good.

01:14:25.153 --> 01:14:27.776
See? Everything cool now.

01:14:28.276 --> 01:14:30.257
Except for...

01:14:30.357 --> 01:14:34.473
...Wyatt here tells me you've been
double dipping in my streets.

01:14:34.573 --> 01:14:38.474
Said you're running an operation
under the name "Sandman".

01:14:39.854 --> 01:14:41.715
Is that right?

01:14:43.024 --> 01:14:45.478
- No, man, not me.
- Not you?

01:14:46.124 --> 01:14:48.630
Get your ass back!
You better back your ass up!

01:14:48.730 --> 01:14:50.269
I told you before I won't play games.

01:14:50.369 --> 01:14:53.432
You know I don't play goddamn games!
Somebody lyin' to me.

01:14:53.532 --> 01:14:55.523
- He's lying!
- You're lying or he's lying...

01:14:55.623 --> 01:14:58.445
...'cause I know you'll say anything
to save your little scrawny ass.

01:14:58.545 --> 01:15:00.192
- No, he's got a safe in the back.
- Where?

01:15:00.292 --> 01:15:03.689
It's in the closet underneath the floorboards.
If you were getting your cut you'd know.

01:15:03.789 --> 01:15:06.353
- There's a lot more, I promise.
- I got nothing back there. Come on.

01:15:06.453 --> 01:15:10.139
- I ain't got nothing back there!
- Ain't nothing back there? Ain't nothin'...

01:15:10.239 --> 01:15:14.675
Get back! You need to hire some new people,
man, 'cause you running out of friends.

01:15:15.156 --> 01:15:17.630
Rest in peace, fools!

01:15:25.944 --> 01:15:28.897
Shoot them mother... kill them!

01:15:29.237 --> 01:15:30.893
Kill...

01:15:51.425 --> 01:15:54.285
- Hi. Thank you.
- Hi.

01:15:57.831 --> 01:16:00.369
Okay. This is Emma Kipling.

01:16:01.169 --> 01:16:03.505
- Hi.
- Are you ready?

01:16:03.605 --> 01:16:06.930
- I think so.
- Well, bring it.

01:18:31.519 --> 01:18:33.386
Where's Kipling?

01:18:35.857 --> 01:18:39.516
Probably freaking out somewhere,
realizing his girl swiped his phone.

01:18:42.896 --> 01:18:46.022
You know, it really is...
too bad about the investors.

01:18:47.602 --> 01:18:50.472
- I think they're gonna go for it.
- No.

01:18:50.972 --> 01:18:52.829
They're not.

01:18:56.176 --> 01:19:00.115
I saw the police report.
You know, the one Daddy had sealed away?

01:19:00.215 --> 01:19:02.901
It started with that poor girl
and a visa 15 years ago.

01:19:03.001 --> 01:19:06.255
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Sherri.

01:19:07.105 --> 01:19:08.995
She was my sister.

01:19:10.291 --> 01:19:12.260
That's what this is all about?

01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.496
Look, man, Sherri was a drug addict.

01:19:15.596 --> 01:19:19.234
She was overdosing. It was no surprise
when we heard she was dead.

01:19:19.334 --> 01:19:22.059
The only surprise was it was a bullet.

01:19:25.739 --> 01:19:30.546
You were so careful with this whole
development thing going on.

01:19:31.746 --> 01:19:35.584
You know, I bet the domestic violence charges
would've sent those investors running.

01:19:36.184 --> 01:19:38.520
Sherri got under your skin, didn't she?

01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:41.189
Sherri meant nothing to me.
Sorry to tell you.

01:19:41.289 --> 01:19:43.492
I know how you feel about her.

01:19:43.992 --> 01:19:46.027
I saw the video.

01:19:46.527 --> 01:19:49.098
I saw what you did to my sister.

01:19:50.698 --> 01:19:52.511
Her throat...

01:19:52.611 --> 01:19:55.923
...her body, I have it. I have that video.

01:19:57.205 --> 01:19:59.523
Soon enough the whole world's gonna know.

01:20:01.776 --> 01:20:04.100
You're in way over your head, Wyatt.

01:20:07.915 --> 01:20:09.439
Really?

01:20:10.717 --> 01:20:15.264
What do you want? You want money?
Is this a shake-down?

01:20:15.556 --> 01:20:18.828
Take a breath and name your price.

01:20:19.728 --> 01:20:21.800
I'll have you set for life.

01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:27.669
Yeah, thought so.

01:20:27.769 --> 01:20:29.804
You know, you hippie kids,
you're all the same.

01:20:29.904 --> 01:20:31.870
You're all so damn emotional.

01:20:32.407 --> 01:20:36.155
Peace, love, unity...

01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:43.807
Respect.

01:20:46.636 --> 01:20:49.461
<i>She knew I would always take care of her.</i>

01:20:58.832 --> 01:21:02.270
<i>The cops traced the gold nine
millimeter back to Kipling...</i>

01:21:02.370 --> 01:21:05.517
<i>...and arrested him
for the murder of James Donovan.</i>

01:21:05.807 --> 01:21:08.109
<i>The evidence was strong.</i>

01:21:08.209 --> 01:21:11.112
<i>Donovan was gonna take over Kipling's club.</i>

01:21:11.212 --> 01:21:14.716
<i>Kipling texted him,
met with him to negotiate...</i>

01:21:14.816 --> 01:21:16.618
<i>...and shot him.</i>

01:21:17.518 --> 01:21:22.924
<i>Gunner down, Kipling down, Donovan dead.</i>

01:21:23.524 --> 01:21:25.360
<i>Lyla was right.</i>

01:21:25.460 --> 01:21:28.051
<i>They all put the nails in Sherri's coffin.</i>

01:22:59.737 --> 01:23:01.574
<i>I got in.</i>

01:23:03.791 --> 01:23:05.649
<i>Really? That's amazing.</i>

01:23:09.629 --> 01:23:11.522
My dad.

01:23:20.375 --> 01:23:22.878
<i>What are you doing for the next two years?</i>

01:23:24.178 --> 01:23:26.202
Are you serious?

01:23:29.016 --> 01:23:32.388
<i>I could definitely see myself
leaving some things behind...</i>

01:23:33.488 --> 01:23:35.890
...and really building a future with you.

01:23:37.256 --> 01:23:39.349
You... you promise?

01:24:08.522 --> 01:24:11.781
<i>I have this philosophy about coincidences.</i>

01:24:15.695 --> 01:24:17.797
<i>There's no such thing.</i>

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:22.158
Don't be mad, Wy.

01:24:25.137 --> 01:24:26.808
Wyatt, take one.

01:24:27.108 --> 01:24:29.398
I need you to know I didn't mean it.

01:24:32.979 --> 01:24:34.700
Start talking.

01:24:36.050 --> 01:24:39.321
Don't worry. I'll explain.

01:24:41.021 --> 01:24:43.113
Just give me a hug.

01:24:45.425 --> 01:24:47.496
I missed you, bro.

01:24:48.596 --> 01:24:50.853
What did you do, sis?

01:24:55.135 --> 01:24:57.426
I knew you would do it.

01:24:59.472 --> 01:25:02.739
You knew I would do what, exactly?

01:25:04.078 --> 01:25:06.947
Do you have any idea what I've been through?

01:25:07.047 --> 01:25:11.507
Of course. Relax. I told you I would explain.

01:25:15.121 --> 01:25:17.124
You look like you've seen a ghost.

01:25:17.224 --> 01:25:20.557
This is not a joke.
I thought you were dead, Sher!

01:25:22.269 --> 01:25:25.300
- This isn't funny!
- I had a bounty on my head!

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:27.885
I was dead the moment you left.

01:25:27.985 --> 01:25:31.549
What happened?

01:25:32.556 --> 01:25:34.561
Don't act like you don't know.

01:25:36.811 --> 01:25:38.713
I sold myself.

01:25:38.813 --> 01:25:40.882
I sold my freedom...

01:25:41.282 --> 01:25:43.910
<i>...and Donovan showed me...</i>

01:25:44.613 --> 01:25:47.144
<i>...what it was really like to be a slave.</i>

01:25:48.189 --> 01:25:52.660
<i>It was not a joke, Wyatt.
He abused me every day.</i>

01:25:54.295 --> 01:25:56.510
I thought it was the end.

01:25:57.398 --> 01:26:00.903
And then Donovan found out
you were going to the cops...

01:26:02.503 --> 01:26:05.886
...so he sent his boy, the Wolf...

01:26:08.608 --> 01:26:12.280
- ...to come after you?
- Wyatt, I knew it was coming.

01:26:12.380 --> 01:26:14.225
Come on.

01:26:15.383 --> 01:26:17.786
I got real close to the Wolf.

01:26:19.186 --> 01:26:23.124
Donovan treated him like trash
just like everybody else.

01:26:23.524 --> 01:26:26.953
I'm not stupid. I set it up two steps ahead.

01:26:27.895 --> 01:26:30.233
Just tell me...

01:26:31.331 --> 01:26:34.123
- ...what happened.
- Alright.

01:26:34.223 --> 01:26:37.793
So I set up a little trap house
in this spot downtown.

01:26:39.772 --> 01:26:44.732
Olivia brings over this chick
and she's like super green but...

01:26:44.832 --> 01:26:47.116
...we're hanging out and whatever.

01:26:49.116 --> 01:26:53.517
Long story short, this chick couldn't
handle her drugs and she OD'd.

01:26:53.888 --> 01:26:56.023
<i>And I'm like freaking out.</i>

01:26:56.123 --> 01:26:58.326
<i>You bring this chick over here
and she does this...</i>

01:26:58.426 --> 01:27:01.830
<i>...and I look at Olivia and I say
"this is all you, you need to fix this".</i>

01:27:01.930 --> 01:27:04.865
<i>But she's not really good
in those situations, you know?</i>

01:27:04.965 --> 01:27:07.392
So I turned tragedy...

01:27:09.250 --> 01:27:11.224
...into an opportunity.

01:27:11.705 --> 01:27:15.509
<i>So I needed to try and find
a way to buy out of my contract...</i>

01:27:15.609 --> 01:27:18.078
<i>...so I made a call to Donovan. I was irate.</i>

01:27:18.178 --> 01:27:21.816
<i>I told him I would go to the press
about what a sick bastard he was.</i>

01:27:21.916 --> 01:27:24.403
<i>I told him I had a video...</i>

01:27:24.503 --> 01:27:28.106
No, of course. Before I did that
I set up the deal with the Wolf.

01:27:28.756 --> 01:27:32.394
<i>But the Wolf
was like you need a back story...</i>

01:27:33.194 --> 01:27:35.418
<i>...and I needed a witness.</i>

01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:39.122
<i>That was you.</i>

01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:46.041
<i>Olivia hit the dead chick up with my tattoo.</i>

01:27:47.141 --> 01:27:51.223
<i>It was perfect, Wyatt.
She was my height, blonde.</i>

01:27:52.913 --> 01:27:56.611
<i>I had to fix her teeth so they couldn't
trace the dental records, you know?</i>

01:27:59.852 --> 01:28:02.089
<i>Wolf tied her up, lit her on fire.</i>

01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:05.694
<i>God, the smell. It was awful.</i>

01:28:06.794 --> 01:28:09.192
But I don't know. In that moment...

01:28:10.292 --> 01:28:12.300
...I was free.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.269
I could disappear.

01:28:16.604 --> 01:28:18.579
And I could operate.

01:28:20.574 --> 01:28:25.608
And that's when business started
to really take off.

01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:28.783
Because you are the Sandman.

01:28:29.383 --> 01:28:32.254
Yeah. That's right.

01:28:33.554 --> 01:28:35.556
You know I like stars.

01:28:35.656 --> 01:28:39.126
Gunner started me out.
I stole from him like 2000 pills.

01:28:39.226 --> 01:28:41.316
I know he was pissed.

01:28:42.296 --> 01:28:45.133
Grinded them up, added a little
to the mix, you know how we do.

01:28:45.233 --> 01:28:47.387
It's all marketing. You taught me that.

01:28:57.244 --> 01:28:59.268
I've got something for you.

01:29:09.922 --> 01:29:12.260
I got a hundred racks in the trunk.

01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:15.313
Don't think I didn't have your back.

01:29:15.963 --> 01:29:17.765
You're my brother.

01:29:17.865 --> 01:29:21.696
I love you. I would have never
let anything happen to you.

01:29:25.506 --> 01:29:28.764
Get your stuff. See you in the car.

01:29:36.549 --> 01:29:38.011
<i>She's right.</i>

01:29:38.111 --> 01:29:42.179
<i>We're all just shooting stars who will
one day fade away into the darkness.</i>

01:29:44.124 --> 01:29:48.678
<i>While you're here you better not
let anybody take away your light.</i>

01:29:51.330 --> 01:29:54.023
<i>I've given away too much of myself.</i>

01:29:56.569 --> 01:29:58.661
<i>My light is dim.</i>

01:30:00.673 --> 01:30:04.186
<i>At some point I gotta do what's best for me.</i>

01:30:07.580 --> 01:30:09.474
<i>But right now...</i>

01:30:09.574 --> 01:30:11.557
<i>...I have no idea what that is.</i>

01:30:12.305 --> 01:30:18.539
