02:30.917 --> 02:32.718
Hey, Ken.

02:36.389 --> 02:39.346
- What's up?
- You're getting skinnier on me.

02:39.426 --> 02:41.027
Yeah.

02:45.064 --> 02:47.320
Where's my money?

02:48.100 --> 02:50.590
Your friend was late four hours last week.

02:50.670 --> 02:53.226
And he's late again today.

02:53.706 --> 02:56.480
I see... go have a talk with him.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.371
The talk is happening right now.

03:05.051 --> 03:07.657
You're going nowhere
until Clive gets here.

03:23.069 --> 03:25.291
<i># Yeah, the kids call him Conejo #</i>

03:25.371 --> 03:27.727
<i># 'Cause he was fast on his feet #</i>

03:27.807 --> 03:32.265
<i># And he was quick with his fists
If he had trouble in the streets #</i>

03:32.345 --> 03:34.534
<i># But when his old man
would hit the bottle #</i>

03:34.614 --> 03:36.919
<i># He'd kick Conejo's ass #</i>

03:36.999 --> 03:41.708
<i># And with a wounded heart
Conejo swore he'd outrun his past #</i>

03:41.788 --> 03:45.244
<i># Run, Conejo, run #</i>

04:08.981 --> 04:13.139
Never seen no speed limit on this road,
Sheriff Kilbaught, so I...

04:13.219 --> 04:17.091
so I made a... a modest estimate.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.481
Never been anything modest
about your modesty, Clive.

04:21.961 --> 04:23.950
This truck don't go
a mile over 50, Sheriff.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.085
Now, you were driving
a different truck this morning.

04:26.165 --> 04:29.522
I've been watching you the last
few weeks, driving back and forth,

04:29.602 --> 04:32.458
back and forth, back and forth.

04:32.538 --> 04:35.662
Now, we both know there ain't nothing in
this town worth taking a second look at.

04:35.742 --> 04:38.531
Yeah. That against the law now, Sheriff?

04:38.611 --> 04:41.233
Okay, come on, out.

04:41.313 --> 04:44.537
Even your mama thinks
you're a piece of shit.

04:46.185 --> 04:48.424
You don't belong here.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.679
You got me thinking.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.582
Two trucks...
hauling the same junk in the same day?

04:56.662 --> 05:00.486
What's garbage like you doing with garbage
like this? Come on, open her up.

05:00.566 --> 05:05.125
It's the only job I can get, seeing as
how people are so damn discriminant...

05:05.705 --> 05:07.827
against those who have paid their dues.

05:07.907 --> 05:11.080
Discriminant? Hell of a word there, Clive.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.422
But it ain't your word.

05:13.502 --> 05:16.803
What did you do with the other truck, huh?

05:16.883 --> 05:19.173
You're gonna start walking...

05:20.253 --> 05:22.024
Hey.

05:23.389 --> 05:27.098
What you got there, boy?
You spit that out.

05:27.760 --> 05:31.184
Spit it out! You spit that out!

05:31.764 --> 05:35.355
Huh? Come on, get up. Get up!

05:53.452 --> 05:55.324
What?

06:08.034 --> 06:10.306
Is it the stew-maker?

06:12.705 --> 06:15.995
Hear the cartel has a guy,
dissolves people in acid,

06:16.075 --> 06:19.400
puts them in a barrel, makes them soup.

06:21.080 --> 06:23.370
Is that who I'm waiting for?

06:24.550 --> 06:26.205
Is it you?

06:26.285 --> 06:29.142
My job is to place a call at 7:30.

06:29.722 --> 06:31.777
And if you don't make the call?

06:31.857 --> 06:34.180
You get put on a list.

06:34.660 --> 06:37.217
And if you get put on the list...

06:37.897 --> 06:39.936
it's unfortunate.

06:42.601 --> 06:45.726
But if Clive isn't here
in the next 15 minutes...

06:46.706 --> 06:50.964
soon enough,
I'll be talking to a dead man.

06:52.044 --> 06:53.800
Well...

06:54.680 --> 06:56.904
If I'm already dead...

07:06.692 --> 07:08.931
You're a dead man!

07:58.944 --> 08:01.935
You ain't doing too good a job
at staying gone.

08:03.215 --> 08:05.237
You know, sometimes...

08:05.317 --> 08:08.674
I can't get through an entire day
without hearing all kinds of rumors

08:08.754 --> 08:10.877
getting told about you.

08:10.957 --> 08:12.812
Like what?

08:12.892 --> 08:14.947
I don't know.

08:15.327 --> 08:18.601
One of my favorite ones is the one about
you getting murdered on Indian Ridge.

08:18.681 --> 08:21.704
Well, they have the decency
to bury me, at least?

08:25.204 --> 08:30.162
Can't say. Don't really keep track
of the rumors I didn't start.

08:30.242 --> 08:33.482
Got any rumors about me
being made sheriff?

08:37.349 --> 08:40.506
Sheriff Kilbaught ain't gonna
like you coming back.

08:40.586 --> 08:43.442
Well, he's gonna find
he ain't got much room to argue.

08:43.522 --> 08:46.029
Maybe I don't like you coming back.

08:51.564 --> 08:55.122
You know I always told you,
you deserve better than this.

09:04.443 --> 09:06.166
Marla.

09:06.646 --> 09:09.002
Welcome home, Wallace.

09:33.739 --> 09:36.305
Hey, how come that thing
always stayed broken?

09:41.080 --> 09:44.003
Don't got a phone connection
at my ma's old house anymore.

09:44.083 --> 09:47.141
Marla was good
about looking after it, but...

09:48.721 --> 09:50.960
Use that one.

09:55.327 --> 09:58.150
You ever hear anything
about me getting murdered?

09:58.230 --> 10:00.553
Yes, sir, I believe I have.

10:01.033 --> 10:03.055
- They shot you in the throat.
- Throat?

10:03.135 --> 10:04.524
- Yeah.
- No kidding?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.819
Heard you was mouthing off
like you used to, and...

10:06.906 --> 10:09.963
somebody just shot you
right there how you stood.

10:10.743 --> 10:14.751
Well, Jerry, ain't you gonna
welcome me back from the dead?

10:19.251 --> 10:21.007
Asshole.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.883
Armor-piercing.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.487
- They call them "cop killers."
- Why is that?

10:35.267 --> 10:37.706
On account of them killing cops.

10:40.773 --> 10:43.664
Do you need it for, like, DNA?

10:44.944 --> 10:47.700
Forensics lab is two weeks
and 150 miles away

10:47.780 --> 10:52.172
from giving half a shit about this town.
Bet you no one's told you that.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.707
Yeah, yeah.

10:55.187 --> 10:58.833
Yep, don't let that
worry you none too much.

10:59.925 --> 11:03.983
<i>You know, are you lonely for a car?
I get lonely when I don't have a car.</i>

11:04.063 --> 11:08.598
<i>But I'm not lonely anymore, 'cause at
Diaz Motors I've got plenty of friends.</i>

11:22.915 --> 11:27.121
You don't got to knock.
I know what you're after.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.792
Come on in.

11:31.290 --> 11:32.995
Yeah?

11:40.332 --> 11:43.157
You are scared shitless.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.392
What did you know about that?

11:46.472 --> 11:49.729
There's just the matter of this job
you come to do.

11:50.809 --> 11:55.234
Six reported incidences of harassing
motorists, two with brutality.

11:55.314 --> 11:58.538
Then there's you, crossing the line.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.440
No, that ain't it.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.378
It's been a long time coming, Leland,
the way you've been running things.

12:06.758 --> 12:08.781
If you ain't scared
of what needs to be done,

12:08.861 --> 12:11.150
then you ain't got no clue
why you're here.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.653
I got sent here to replace you.

12:13.733 --> 12:16.355
Maybe a day too late,
but replace you nonetheless.

12:16.435 --> 12:20.323
You got sent here because
it's your punishment, Wallace.

12:20.773 --> 12:23.045
Taking your statement, is all.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.564
You fetch me some water, would you?

12:28.314 --> 12:30.019
Hmm?

12:32.952 --> 12:36.781
Hm. You have no idea what that...

12:37.756 --> 12:40.740
that boy Clive was threatening to bring.

12:42.894 --> 12:46.051
These horrible people
doing immoral things,

12:46.131 --> 12:47.961
and now they're creeping
across the border,

12:48.041 --> 12:52.174
threatening to make
the boogeyman a real thing.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.062
It's enough to give you a good start.

12:57.142 --> 13:01.184
It'll make you want to wait
for all the bad things to come get you.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.378
I don't regret what happened.

13:12.458 --> 13:17.016
Takes a willing hand
to punish horrible men.

13:17.596 --> 13:21.764
They're building a case, Le.
They're gonna lock you away.

13:25.070 --> 13:28.719
You come here to get my statement? Huh?

13:30.075 --> 13:34.001
Expecting me to... say I'm innocent?

13:35.581 --> 13:39.404
I was gonna make that boy walk.
I was gonna put him on that back road.

13:39.484 --> 13:42.141
Leave him to the boogeyman
to rip him apart,

13:42.221 --> 13:46.979
or return him to whatever
ungodly dirt he came from.

13:47.359 --> 13:49.833
And if the road couldn't do it...

13:56.135 --> 14:00.597
I'd do it myself, 'cause sometimes
that's just what you got to do.

14:01.941 --> 14:04.331
Well, you've done enough.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.104
Ah.

14:21.393 --> 14:23.683
Welcome home, Wallace.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.106
Asshole.

14:36.708 --> 14:38.860
<i>Ken Mersey didn't go home last night.</i>

14:38.940 --> 14:41.734
<i>He's been reported missing this morning.</i>

14:48.954 --> 14:51.477
Boys need stupid things to do.

14:52.157 --> 14:54.079
That's how their mamas wire them.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.713
Well, his mama wasn't no electrician.

14:58.263 --> 15:00.520
Explains the dim bulb.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.239
It's not like you to be so funny so early.

15:06.038 --> 15:07.226
Well...

15:07.306 --> 15:10.947
I always figured Ken Mersey liked you
a whole lot more than you liked him.

15:11.027 --> 15:13.198
Maybe he just don't want to show his face.

15:13.278 --> 15:16.335
He's missing, I'm worried. It doesn't
have to be so black-and-white, Lilly.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.688
For fuck's sake.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.008
All I'm saying is that...

15:23.088 --> 15:25.978
maybe he's gone
because he wants to be gone.

15:26.658 --> 15:28.881
This ain't hardly about Ken, is it?

15:28.961 --> 15:31.461
This is about Wallace coming back.

15:32.431 --> 15:35.103
Hey, do you want to take care of this?

15:37.136 --> 15:40.227
Oh, Jerry, you're just aching
for coffee, aren't you?

15:41.807 --> 15:43.630
Here.

15:44.510 --> 15:47.299
Drink up. There's plenty more.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.001
That's an awful shame about Kilbaught.

15:49.081 --> 15:53.125
Old Sheriff Kilbaught is a violent dinosaur
going the way of his kind.

15:53.205 --> 15:56.207
- How about yourself?
- I'm good on coffee.

15:59.645 --> 16:03.479
Spent a good five months figuring out
smuggling routes up in Indian Ridge.

16:07.085 --> 16:11.544
Kept on hearing about...
peculiarities and such.

16:12.424 --> 16:17.451
Catapults and back-alley breast implants.

16:19.131 --> 16:21.787
Even heard about a submarine once,

16:21.867 --> 16:25.658
somebody took the time to build
by hand in their garage.

16:30.476 --> 16:32.181
Mm.

16:35.380 --> 16:37.737
And these brass bastards...

16:38.217 --> 16:40.740
they buy fear and panic...

16:41.420 --> 16:44.178
which makes them a whole lot
cleaner than money.

16:46.258 --> 16:49.648
You can speculate all you want
about where they came from...

16:49.728 --> 16:53.819
or where they're going,
but the real concern here is,

16:53.899 --> 16:57.928
what's gonna happen if this bullet
don't make its destination.

16:58.437 --> 17:00.225
So...

17:00.305 --> 17:02.812
you found just the one?

17:35.240 --> 17:37.012
Shit.

18:12.844 --> 18:15.167
You still alive?

18:21.119 --> 18:24.794
Someone's calling looking
to speak with the sheriff!

18:29.628 --> 18:32.252
He sure rushed my gate in a hurry.

18:33.632 --> 18:35.420
I called you because the plates came back.

18:35.500 --> 18:38.891
They were registered to a used car lot
over in your jurisdiction.

18:38.971 --> 18:41.093
Diaz Classics?

18:41.173 --> 18:44.263
Yeah. Showed up as stolen.

18:44.843 --> 18:47.499
I called it in. It took 40 minutes.

18:47.579 --> 18:49.668
Anyway, they chased him
all the way out to the 24,

18:49.748 --> 18:52.504
lost him out there on a back road
before your guy went in after him.

18:52.584 --> 18:54.473
What guy?

18:54.553 --> 18:58.110
I don't know. I couldn't flag him,
but I saw him. I saw the tan uniform.

18:58.190 --> 19:01.313
I figured I'd just call your partner
in the morning and check in.

19:01.393 --> 19:03.415
Was me and the old man.

19:03.495 --> 19:06.151
As of this morning, got to be just me.

19:07.231 --> 19:10.622
<i>Dispatch, we have a code 32
off Carrion Road.</i>

19:10.702 --> 19:13.375
<i>Burning pretty good, by the smell of it.</i>

19:17.809 --> 19:20.416
<i>I think I found us Ken Mersey.</i>

20:11.630 --> 20:14.287
What the hell happened to you, Ken?

20:15.967 --> 20:18.307
Where'd you get off to?

20:30.449 --> 20:32.154
Shit.

20:40.826 --> 20:42.447
Well, that's everyone that's come in.

20:42.527 --> 20:46.919
Closest thing to a Molotov cocktail these
folks have seen is a broken air conditioner.

20:46.999 --> 20:50.589
Sorry about that, Deputy.
But I don't believe your friend is here.

20:50.669 --> 20:52.925
Didn't say he was a friend.

20:53.305 --> 20:55.511
And it's Sheriff.

20:59.544 --> 21:01.968
Is Ken in there?

21:03.048 --> 21:05.320
Is he okay?

21:09.588 --> 21:12.295
Don't give me that look, Wallace.

21:15.861 --> 21:18.150
Surprising, is all.

21:18.530 --> 21:21.187
Ken Mersey is a good man.

21:22.767 --> 21:24.973
He looks after me.

21:33.945 --> 21:36.636
Oh, Wallace, stop it.

21:37.816 --> 21:40.266
What do you know about the truck?

21:41.920 --> 21:45.411
He bought it. He told me
to fix it up and sell it to Shep.

21:46.591 --> 21:49.314
You know he was smuggling ammunitions
across the border in that truck?

21:49.394 --> 21:51.850
- That's a lie.
- Well, whatever he ain't telling you

21:51.930 --> 21:54.920
got him in trouble last night,
got him confronted.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.822
By who?

21:57.302 --> 21:59.526
Still sorting that out.

22:01.006 --> 22:03.462
But whoever that may be...

22:03.942 --> 22:07.532
I ain't gonna tell you that Ken Mersey don't
got his own consequences coming to him.

22:07.612 --> 22:10.052
Ah, fuck.

22:17.122 --> 22:19.411
You bring him home, Wallace.

23:37.369 --> 23:40.268
<i># Y tú que te creías #</i>

23:40.348 --> 23:45.130
<i># El rey de todo el mundo #</i>

23:46.558 --> 23:49.657
<i># Y tú que nunca fuiste #</i>

23:49.737 --> 23:53.524
<i># Capáz de perdonar #</i>

23:55.494 --> 23:58.434
<i># Y cruel y despiadado #</i>

23:58.514 --> 24:01.334
<i># De todo te reías #</i>

24:01.414 --> 24:03.114
<i># Hoy imploras... ##</i>

24:03.194 --> 24:06.484
They got your commercial
on TV up in Indian Ridge.

24:06.564 --> 24:10.122
It's 4:00 in the morning,
but it's TV nonetheless.

24:11.202 --> 24:13.525
You trick-or-treating?

24:13.605 --> 24:17.162
Was wondering if you knew anything
about Ken Mersey going missing.

24:17.242 --> 24:19.664
Yeah, what kind of trouble he got?

24:19.744 --> 24:22.536
The considerable kind, I guess.

24:24.516 --> 24:26.405
Ooh.

24:26.685 --> 24:30.815
Really taking yourself seriously
in that uniform, ain't you?

24:31.222 --> 24:34.679
Don't mind going after
an old drinking buddy like that?

24:34.759 --> 24:37.782
As far as I can see, he's under arrest.

24:37.862 --> 24:40.035
If he's still alive.

24:47.906 --> 24:50.126
How do you take your coffee?

24:51.176 --> 24:53.248
I don't.

25:01.719 --> 25:03.491
Well...

25:09.427 --> 25:11.784
No sales being had.

25:12.764 --> 25:16.655
No maintenance or repairs being had.

25:17.235 --> 25:19.692
It's just a whole lot of nothing.

25:21.022 --> 25:23.795
I haven't had a real need
for Ken in the garage.

25:23.875 --> 25:27.398
- What about the stolen truck?
- Trucks.

25:28.780 --> 25:31.102
He took them with.

25:31.182 --> 25:35.299
He didn't say anything. He just... went.

25:35.620 --> 25:38.243
That don't sound like him.

25:38.323 --> 25:41.547
People have a way
of changing on you, I guess.

25:42.027 --> 25:44.046
I guess.

25:45.597 --> 25:48.287
I want the trucks back.
That's why I only reported one.

25:48.367 --> 25:50.791
I wanted him to know, you know?

25:52.771 --> 25:57.162
I didn't really want Ken
to get into any sort of trouble,

25:57.242 --> 25:59.278
knowing his mama and all.

25:59.978 --> 26:03.868
Ken was cutting armor-piercing slugs
into scrap engine parts

26:03.948 --> 26:06.172
not 20 feet from where you're sitting.

26:07.252 --> 26:10.141
Well, if he was doing any of the sort,
it wasn't in my garage.

26:10.221 --> 26:14.386
There's no other place in town
suited for that kind of... activity.

26:14.876 --> 26:18.687
First off, how about his garage?

26:19.597 --> 26:24.028
- Ken opened his own shop?
- Always get a ribbon for trying.

26:27.739 --> 26:29.445
Asshole.

28:55.720 --> 28:58.093
You're good right there, Wallace.

29:01.292 --> 29:03.214
What'd you get yourself into, Kenny?

29:03.294 --> 29:08.671
I took 250,000 to leave this place...

29:09.901 --> 29:12.391
to not belong in here...

29:12.871 --> 29:15.962
for just... for just one night.

29:17.642 --> 29:20.298
It kicks a good bit of life into you.

29:20.378 --> 29:22.734
That cousin of yours...

29:22.814 --> 29:25.170
he's laid out on a slab.

29:25.750 --> 29:29.697
Kilbaught took his head clean off,
and you ain't too far behind.

29:31.155 --> 29:33.906
I want to know where the bullets are
coming from and who struck the deal.

29:33.986 --> 29:37.282
I want names, names I can hunt down
and put away this side of the border.

29:37.362 --> 29:40.585
The cartel won't take this lightly.
They'll send someone.

29:40.665 --> 29:44.324
What's coming, it ain't some butcher.

29:45.804 --> 29:50.035
It's punishment.
You can't stop a thing like that.

29:50.808 --> 29:52.897
All that money you took can't buy the fact

29:52.977 --> 29:56.254
that now you got them
coming after Marla too.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.040
She didn't know.

30:02.720 --> 30:05.009
They won't care.

30:05.089 --> 30:07.547
I only took my cut!

30:32.620 --> 30:34.526
What's this?

30:35.186 --> 30:38.059
Oh, you chicken shit, just go.

30:48.399 --> 30:50.438
Fuck me.

33:27.325 --> 33:29.164
Kenny.

33:32.130 --> 33:33.869
Fuck.

33:59.023 --> 34:02.714
Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, God.

35:46.998 --> 35:49.471
What the hell?

35:51.202 --> 35:53.074
Wallace?

35:54.405 --> 35:55.927
Wallace!

35:56.007 --> 35:57.854
Wallace.

35:59.076 --> 36:01.166
Hey, Wallace.

36:01.946 --> 36:05.838
What the hell happened to you, son? Huh?

36:07.485 --> 36:11.742
- Who did this to you, boy?
- When it happens... when it stops...

36:11.822 --> 36:14.478
You can't feel it. It don't hurt.

36:14.558 --> 36:16.931
We got to get you some...

36:20.164 --> 36:23.481
Come on, Wallace.
Come on, you're gonna be okay.

36:51.896 --> 36:53.968
How does that feel?

36:57.451 --> 36:59.758
About as good as it looks.

37:06.877 --> 37:09.734
If we fetch it, we can re-attach it.

37:10.114 --> 37:14.322
They do... do that, right?

37:16.921 --> 37:20.474
Well, you got one of two options.

37:20.554 --> 37:23.441
Get used to it, or don't look at it.

37:24.695 --> 37:27.485
- Hear that?
- What?

37:27.565 --> 37:31.089
That'd be me, slow-clapping you...

37:31.669 --> 37:34.660
if my clapping hand was still with us.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.830
Could have been a lot worse on you.

37:39.310 --> 37:41.432
I saw your friend
when they brought him in.

37:41.512 --> 37:43.569
He ain't my friend.

37:46.050 --> 37:48.144
Way you saw him...

37:49.820 --> 37:52.476
Kilbaught was right about people like him

37:52.556 --> 37:55.248
bringing hell up into this town.

37:57.428 --> 38:01.249
The way I see it, Ken Mersey
got what was coming to him.

38:01.599 --> 38:05.601
- Getting his head cut off the way...
- You said you were gonna bring him home.

38:07.805 --> 38:11.028
- Marla...
- That's what you said to me, Wallace.

38:11.108 --> 38:14.133
Well, the hell with him.
I know what I said.

38:15.413 --> 38:18.071
There was nothing to bring home.

38:20.751 --> 38:23.057
You're such a fuck.

39:02.426 --> 39:05.412
Shepard Diaz.

39:05.762 --> 39:10.541
History of misconduct, brutality,
or any badges with that name?

39:35.526 --> 39:37.431
Hang on.

39:40.931 --> 39:42.670
Shoot.

39:44.635 --> 39:47.658
Yep. Simon, yep.

39:47.938 --> 39:50.528
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

39:51.208 --> 39:57.060
Well, does the system make any note
of tattoos or distinct markings and such?

40:00.918 --> 40:02.874
The neck.

40:05.603 --> 40:07.179
Yeah.

40:08.659 --> 40:10.965
Last known address?

40:30.981 --> 40:34.072
Wallace, I need to talk.

40:34.752 --> 40:38.159
Think I've done more than enough
of that with you today.

40:44.795 --> 40:48.235
I'm sorry for snapping at you
back at the hospital.

40:50.634 --> 40:53.740
- Shit.
- Wallace...

40:55.973 --> 40:58.414
You should be back in that bed.

41:00.611 --> 41:03.065
You ran off without these.

41:05.082 --> 41:07.522
I don't want you to do this.

41:15.025 --> 41:18.883
- It's not your job to punish me like this.
- I ain't punishing.

41:19.263 --> 41:21.886
Going out there
and getting yourself killed?

41:22.266 --> 41:24.593
Yeah, what are you calling that?

41:27.838 --> 41:30.247
Please don't do this.

41:41.218 --> 41:43.841
You're all I got left.

41:48.225 --> 41:52.051
Wasn't too good at taking you
away from this place, was I?

41:53.931 --> 41:56.622
- No.
- Mm.

41:58.402 --> 42:02.277
You are tired, busted,
and hurt, is what you are.

42:10.180 --> 42:12.270
Don't be mad.

42:14.318 --> 42:17.444
Got to thinking about
that stolen jalopy of yours,

42:17.524 --> 42:20.761
which got me thinking about your ex-wife.

42:20.891 --> 42:23.851
Hm? Hm.

42:24.862 --> 42:27.151
I couldn't hold on either, Shep.
Never could.

42:27.231 --> 42:30.085
And I was captivated by my bride.

42:31.335 --> 42:34.593
I just couldn't tell
which color was what on her.

42:35.673 --> 42:38.129
Didn't know why I never did bother.

42:38.909 --> 42:42.834
Anyway, she got to walking out on me.

42:45.766 --> 42:49.450
Been gone more years now
than we was actually together.

42:51.972 --> 42:53.728
No.

42:54.958 --> 42:57.206
You can't win a woman back. That's...

42:57.286 --> 43:00.051
something ugly beasts like you
and me do not get to do.

43:00.131 --> 43:02.021
- Oh, go fuck yourself, Le.
- Hey!

43:02.101 --> 43:04.955
- Fuck you, fuck you.
- Hold on there a second.

43:05.035 --> 43:08.659
Don't you go dwelling in dignity.
Does not suit you.

43:08.739 --> 43:11.214
Doesn't suit us.

43:12.509 --> 43:15.967
She's half your worth, and she's gone.

43:17.247 --> 43:20.437
You haven't sold a car
on that lot for ages.

43:20.517 --> 43:24.141
You got a face like a thumb,
and you stuck it on a TV commercial.

43:24.221 --> 43:27.010
How dare you, hmm?

43:29.059 --> 43:33.272
I do must ask myself, how the hell
do you keep this place afloat?

43:40.704 --> 43:44.512
Come on, sit down, Shep. Hmm? Sit.

43:51.248 --> 43:54.605
You are not an unfortunate man.

43:54.685 --> 43:56.974
You're an auspicious parasite,

43:57.054 --> 44:00.935
and I need you to tell me
who's on the other side of that spook.

44:03.160 --> 44:05.985
You came in with your mind made up.

44:08.265 --> 44:11.123
What the fuck you want me to tell you, Le?

44:12.703 --> 44:14.508
Huh?

44:16.607 --> 44:19.863
- Can't ask you to trust me.
- Well, then don't.

44:19.943 --> 44:22.734
Shame on you.

44:24.214 --> 44:27.106
I had trouble finding the fix for it.

44:28.886 --> 44:31.058
But I found it.

44:36.960 --> 44:39.333
So what's this, then?

45:38.722 --> 45:41.934
It's only ever been three crosses
that I remember.

45:43.610 --> 45:45.980
Who's the fourth?

45:48.532 --> 45:51.196
Could be the one waiting for me.

45:52.336 --> 45:55.983
"This god-forsaken road
will bury us all somehow."

45:57.674 --> 45:59.980
Was the way Ken said it.

46:12.923 --> 46:15.464
You look good with that promotion on you.

46:17.294 --> 46:20.250
You already got made sheriff.
You got what you wanted.

46:20.330 --> 46:23.487
- Oh, yeah.
- What about me, huh?

46:23.567 --> 46:27.775
Wasn't so much a promotion,
like I said it was.

46:29.940 --> 46:32.329
Why wasn't I good enough?

46:32.409 --> 46:34.816
Good enough for you to stay?

46:44.088 --> 46:45.946
Can't...

47:00.437 --> 47:02.660
So how much money he take?

47:02.740 --> 47:04.762
Well, enough, I guess.

47:04.842 --> 47:07.265
You sound like you really care.

47:07.995 --> 47:10.137
They don't care about the money neither.

47:10.217 --> 47:14.613
They just got to decide if his death
is enough. Simple as that.

47:15.218 --> 47:18.442
If they can find Ken
in the middle of a back road,

47:18.522 --> 47:21.312
they're sure as hell are gonna find you.

47:22.492 --> 47:24.915
I've seen the man who killed him.

47:25.495 --> 47:26.850
I know his name, I know where he is.

47:26.930 --> 47:30.125
And what are you gonna do?
You can't even write him a ticket.

47:31.335 --> 47:35.659
Kilbaught, he knew.
There's no arresting anyone.

47:36.139 --> 47:38.345
Not anymore.

47:41.044 --> 47:43.267
I need a ride.

48:03.300 --> 48:05.872
Up here, on the left.

48:26.790 --> 48:29.113
You know you don't got to go.

48:29.493 --> 48:31.849
Call it a good cause, then.

48:32.529 --> 48:36.023
The only good cause you'll ever have
is listening to me.

48:38.836 --> 48:40.909
We could go.

48:44.424 --> 48:46.578
Keep driving.

48:48.578 --> 48:50.817
I'd really like that.

49:31.891 --> 49:33.611
Oh, fuck!

49:34.691 --> 49:37.288
Get back, get back!

49:37.895 --> 49:39.916
Go on, put it down.

49:39.996 --> 49:43.671
That girl behind you ain't gonna like you
with no pecker. Put the fucking gun down.

49:47.337 --> 49:49.767
Who the fuck are you?

49:49.907 --> 49:52.176
Who the fuck are you?

49:52.576 --> 49:55.413
I'm the man looking for Samuel Gibbons.

49:56.713 --> 49:58.737
That'd be me.

50:00.017 --> 50:01.438
Is this you hiding him? Huh?

50:01.518 --> 50:05.442
Look, look, I don't know much,
but just take whatever you want and go.

50:05.522 --> 50:07.685
Shut up!

50:08.325 --> 50:12.416
- You're a cop?
- I work for county, same as you.

50:12.596 --> 50:15.819
Whatever the issue is here,
you and I, we can sort it out.

50:15.899 --> 50:18.788
- We can understand each other.
- How is it that they own you?

50:18.868 --> 50:21.624
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I know they own you.

50:21.704 --> 50:25.613
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- You son of a bitch, I know they do!

50:25.693 --> 50:28.918
- Stop it! Stop it! Oh, my God!
- You're gonna take me to him!

50:28.998 --> 50:31.668
Now we're gonna make a liar out of you.

50:31.748 --> 50:34.071
Why are you helping him?

50:34.751 --> 50:37.023
Take me to him!

50:40.624 --> 50:43.013
You gonna take me to him now?

50:43.493 --> 50:45.933
I don't know what you want me tell you.
I don't know!

50:46.013 --> 50:47.584
They're good at making threats.

50:47.664 --> 50:49.686
- Get the fuck away from him!
- Get back.

50:49.766 --> 50:51.555
- Just stop!
- They're efficient

50:51.635 --> 50:53.597
at getting their points understood.

50:53.837 --> 50:56.926
So maybe you had a gun held to your head.

50:57.006 --> 51:00.834
- But I bet she ain't had a gun held to hers.
- No, stop it! You stop it, goddamn it.

51:00.914 --> 51:04.084
No, please, please.
Stop, goddamn it, please.

51:04.214 --> 51:06.773
Stop, stop. No.

51:15.492 --> 51:18.215
- Stop him.
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

51:18.295 --> 51:22.953
What happens to her is because of you.
Now, you tell me where he is!

51:23.033 --> 51:26.356
I swear to God,
I don't know what you fucking mean.

51:30.674 --> 51:32.929
You know what he done.

51:33.009 --> 51:35.448
And that don't make you
any better than him.

51:50.727 --> 51:52.966
Oh, my God.

51:54.864 --> 51:57.304
Is that the guy who killed Ken?

52:01.104 --> 52:03.143
I don't know.

52:06.776 --> 52:10.308
- I was sure that he...
- You were gonna kill him anyway?

52:13.950 --> 52:16.475
What is it with you, Wallace?

52:18.855 --> 52:21.788
You find the wrong guy,
and then you won't stop.

52:22.058 --> 52:25.565
It ain't making you any better
than what you're chasing after.

52:33.970 --> 52:36.209
Marla, wait.

53:11.374 --> 53:13.704
What a pair, huh?

53:14.478 --> 53:16.216
Yeah.

53:19.916 --> 53:23.941
What's that you said about good
people disappearing? Was that...

53:24.521 --> 53:28.245
'cause there's no protecting them?
Or you fail to protect them?

53:28.325 --> 53:30.981
Or you scare them away?

53:31.061 --> 53:33.283
One of those.

53:33.963 --> 53:36.069
All of those.

53:40.103 --> 53:42.325
Nearly killed an innocent man.

53:42.405 --> 53:44.461
Well, there's no getting him,

53:44.541 --> 53:46.798
the man you're after.

53:48.378 --> 53:50.333
Could be anybody.

53:50.413 --> 53:53.470
Because incidentally...

53:54.050 --> 53:55.705
he is anybody.

53:55.785 --> 53:57.974
Monsters hide in plain sight.

53:58.054 --> 54:02.079
And once you put enough money in a man's
hands, he'll do almost whatever you want,

54:02.159 --> 54:06.335
and you can turn him
into whatever you need him to be.

54:07.931 --> 54:11.293
Just like these boogeymen
on the back roads.

54:11.968 --> 54:14.207
They're demons.

54:16.573 --> 54:19.963
And "demons" is only a way
of calling their illness.

54:20.243 --> 54:23.266
- Ahh.
- What's there to stop it, then?

54:23.746 --> 54:27.421
You go after the illness itself.

54:29.286 --> 54:31.374
Crumpled under the vest?

54:31.454 --> 54:35.212
Señor Diaz selling them crap.
They're after Shep.

54:36.292 --> 54:41.625
So Shep was using Ken to smuggle
shitty bullets into Mexico? Huh.

54:45.802 --> 54:47.791
Would you do it?

54:47.871 --> 54:52.016
Make a go at it for 250,000?
That don't seem enough.

54:53.643 --> 54:55.665
No, I wouldn't.

54:55.745 --> 54:58.418
I wouldn't run if I knew I couldn't.

55:01.084 --> 55:03.541
I'd burrow down.

55:04.821 --> 55:06.403
Where?

56:31.941 --> 56:35.089
Put him on the back road,
let the back road take him?

56:36.079 --> 56:38.735
What's different, then? What's changed?

56:38.815 --> 56:42.372
Shep owes your friend Ken Mersey a death.

56:42.452 --> 56:47.498
Now, he'll pay for it,
and he'll pay for it right, to us.

56:48.691 --> 56:52.815
- You're making an arrest?
- That's why you're here.

56:52.895 --> 56:56.375
Helping restore me to the man I once was.

56:57.767 --> 57:00.033
He wasn't my friend.

57:01.538 --> 57:03.159
This guy, you sure he's here?

57:03.239 --> 57:06.947
Asshole showed me a wire receipt
just before he shot me.

57:11.014 --> 57:13.788
Hey, stupid! Come on out!
We know you're in there!

57:35.535 --> 57:38.134
Oh, shit! He's under the house!

57:46.149 --> 57:47.740
You gonna shoot?

57:47.820 --> 57:50.097
I was thinking about it, yeah.

57:59.929 --> 58:01.618
Fuck.

58:01.698 --> 58:04.003
Put it down, Shep!

58:26.072 --> 58:29.145
Wallace! Wallace!

58:59.589 --> 59:01.411
Oh, shit.

59:06.512 --> 59:09.303
It's okay. It's okay.

59:10.933 --> 59:12.823
Easy.

59:13.503 --> 59:18.161
So... that hovel you've been squatting...

59:18.641 --> 59:21.084
what made you think of that place, huh?

59:22.979 --> 59:25.402
Might as well spill it, Shep.

59:26.382 --> 59:30.829
The way you've been going about getting
folks killed is only gonna get me madder.

59:31.721 --> 59:34.478
Some young filly on the side, huh?

59:35.358 --> 59:38.581
- That was a long time ago, Sheriff.
- Sheriff? Oh, no, no.

59:38.661 --> 59:43.537
I don't think there's any need for
formalities anymore, not after you shot me.

59:47.537 --> 59:49.893
What the hell you mean by that?

59:50.673 --> 59:52.650
It's only me.

01:00:04.587 --> 01:00:06.593
It's a list.

01:00:10.026 --> 01:00:14.145
It's a walking, breathing list,
and it will follow you to hell.

01:00:14.497 --> 01:00:18.688
The guy they use,
don't know where he's coming from,

01:00:18.868 --> 01:00:21.991
but he finds who they tell him to find.

01:00:22.071 --> 01:00:24.581
He is a butcher.

01:00:25.441 --> 01:00:27.864
Won't matter how far I get.

01:00:28.444 --> 01:00:30.199
Won't matter where I go.

01:00:30.279 --> 01:00:33.770
- They're looking to make an example.
- You've been liquidating assets.

01:00:33.850 --> 01:00:38.542
I'm trying to buy my name
off that forsaken list.

01:00:40.022 --> 01:00:43.612
I've given them everything
that's not locked down on my lot.

01:00:43.692 --> 01:00:48.308
I've given them every buckskin
I've earned, and it's still not enough.

01:00:48.831 --> 01:00:51.283
Who's wiring your money?

01:00:53.970 --> 01:00:58.402
My ex-wife's pension,
few drops in a bucket.

01:00:58.941 --> 01:01:02.015
All her life amounted to, I guess.

01:01:08.718 --> 01:01:11.208
I need Ken Mersey.

01:01:11.788 --> 01:01:14.877
If he made it back with that money
and I get my hands on that money,

01:01:14.957 --> 01:01:18.948
I promise you, Le, on my life,
I promise you...

01:01:19.028 --> 01:01:21.419
I'll make all this go away.

01:01:23.099 --> 01:01:25.345
I'll even cut you in.

01:01:31.574 --> 01:01:34.765
All you do is let me
walk on out that door.

01:01:35.845 --> 01:01:38.127
Let me make it right.

01:01:39.182 --> 01:01:41.625
How much you reckon that's worth?

01:01:43.085 --> 01:01:45.676
You stay another day in this town...

01:01:46.756 --> 01:01:49.647
and you're gonna answer for what you did.

01:01:50.827 --> 01:01:54.782
They'll put you in a cement box
for what you did to Clive.

01:01:57.133 --> 01:01:59.941
I'm offering you kindness.

01:02:09.445 --> 01:02:11.784
I'll mull it over.

01:02:18.387 --> 01:02:20.176
Fuck!

01:02:20.606 --> 01:02:22.863
So that's you leaving.

01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:26.816
Always known what's going on
in my head, haven't you?

01:02:26.896 --> 01:02:29.186
Not by choice.

01:02:29.766 --> 01:02:31.654
Yeah, lucky you.

01:02:31.734 --> 01:02:34.928
Maybe some day, when luck can afford me.

01:02:35.008 --> 01:02:37.094
Yes, ma'am.

01:02:38.574 --> 01:02:41.759
You are sweet in small doses.

01:02:49.118 --> 01:02:51.157
Your picture.

01:02:54.957 --> 01:02:57.182
You deserve better.

01:02:59.462 --> 01:03:00.483
Wallace, please don't...

01:03:00.563 --> 01:03:03.620
And I'm gonna keep
telling it to you like that...

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:05.855
until you leave.

01:03:05.935 --> 01:03:07.925
I can't.

01:03:09.605 --> 01:03:11.527
Can't think of something
nice to say to her.

01:03:11.607 --> 01:03:14.931
Lilly's a nice girl,
and she was asking for a rosary,

01:03:15.011 --> 01:03:19.552
- so I think I should get it.
- Okay. I'll go fetch it.

01:03:21.017 --> 01:03:23.323
Wallace, please stay.

01:03:25.722 --> 01:03:27.977
This place is...

01:03:28.557 --> 01:03:32.484
scorched of life. It's a graveyard.

01:03:33.830 --> 01:03:37.521
Think about leaving.
Do what you got to do, but...

01:03:39.402 --> 01:03:42.809
The only person
that's gonna save you is you.

01:04:02.258 --> 01:04:05.581
- Sorry, I thought Lilly was in here...
- It's you.

01:04:05.661 --> 01:04:07.935
What about me?

01:04:13.536 --> 01:04:16.626
Can't remember the last time
I walked around with a picture

01:04:16.706 --> 01:04:19.063
of a girl in my wallet.

01:04:20.743 --> 01:04:24.834
Well... one that
I didn't love to pieces, anyway.

01:04:25.614 --> 01:04:30.398
I don't know. Maybe I'm talking
about a different Ken Mersey.

01:04:39.628 --> 01:04:43.971
- I know who you're talking about.
- The Ken Mersey I got to know...

01:04:45.301 --> 01:04:48.508
couldn't talk about anything
that wasn't you.

01:04:59.325 --> 01:05:03.720
His share of the take was always
your share of the take.

01:05:23.389 --> 01:05:25.673
I hear he does that.

01:06:19.461 --> 01:06:21.834
Always the church girls.

01:06:36.946 --> 01:06:38.518
No.

01:06:42.218 --> 01:06:43.957
Shit.

01:07:00.369 --> 01:07:02.408
Damn it.

01:07:08.611 --> 01:07:10.483
Lilly?

01:07:18.054 --> 01:07:19.859
Lilly?

01:09:10.666 --> 01:09:14.652
Slow down, Harry.
We're stopping all cars tonight.

01:09:15.938 --> 01:09:19.094
- What the hell is this?
- What in the hell you think it is?

01:09:19.174 --> 01:09:21.796
What the hell is that cock-skin
doing with a gun?

01:09:21.877 --> 01:09:25.667
Now, now, now. You're gonna have
to mind your manners around Jerry

01:09:25.747 --> 01:09:29.872
- from here on in. He's been deputized.
- What is it you're doing here?

01:09:29.952 --> 01:09:34.475
Someone is coming to make something
terrible out of Shep Diaz

01:09:34.555 --> 01:09:38.580
and make an example out of this town.
I reckon I'm here doing the same thing.

01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:41.952
By protecting Shep
or by getting him killed?

01:09:43.432 --> 01:09:45.921
Either way is fine by me.

01:09:48.103 --> 01:09:50.827
You are a mean dinosaur, Leland.

01:09:53.309 --> 01:09:56.899
Congratulations, Harry. Go get your gun.
You've just been deputized.

01:09:56.979 --> 01:10:00.760
Here, you take this. And I'll take this.

01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.888
Go on, now.

01:10:08.957 --> 01:10:12.415
What the hell is this between you and him?

01:10:13.595 --> 01:10:15.859
What's that you call it?

01:10:18.033 --> 01:10:21.790
That might as well have been you
out there dismembering people.

01:10:21.870 --> 01:10:24.160
He ain't hurting no one
that don't got it coming.

01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:27.073
He took my fucking hand!

01:10:28.410 --> 01:10:32.068
We fall short of God's glory
because of people like you.

01:10:32.748 --> 01:10:36.805
What about Marla?
Because that's who he's off getting tonight.

01:10:36.885 --> 01:10:41.243
I seen the pictures, the spying
you've been doing for him!

01:10:41.323 --> 01:10:44.887
God, that's how he knows
where to find who he needs to find.

01:10:44.967 --> 01:10:49.018
If Marla dies tonight,
I'm gonna make sure that falls on you.

01:10:49.098 --> 01:10:51.042
His faith is being tested,

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:53.109
- like I'm being tested.
- Where's he coming in from?

01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:54.827
- It's the only way he knows.
- No, I need to know.

01:10:54.907 --> 01:10:57.929
- So we can be together.
- Where's he coming in from?

01:11:07.182 --> 01:11:09.772
You expect him to come get you?

01:11:09.852 --> 01:11:12.121
Come and save you?

01:11:13.021 --> 01:11:15.454
I'm the one saving him.

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.572
Well, you ain't gonna do
too good of a job of that tonight.

01:11:24.365 --> 01:11:28.642
There's gonna be trouble like you've never
known if you don't let him finish that list.

01:11:35.010 --> 01:11:37.516
What are you doing to her?

01:11:40.549 --> 01:11:43.139
There's only ever been three crosses.

01:11:43.619 --> 01:11:47.042
Someone's gonna come aiming to take Lilly
out of here. You don't try to be brave.

01:11:47.122 --> 01:11:50.947
You let him do just that. He's gonna ask,
and you tell him where Marla and Shep went.

01:11:51.027 --> 01:11:53.182
- I don't know where they went.
- The crosses down on Carrion Road.

01:11:53.262 --> 01:11:55.152
Tell him that,
and don't get in his way, you hear?

01:11:55.232 --> 01:11:58.395
- Where are you going?
- To protect this town.

01:11:59.101 --> 01:12:02.808
Dig faster, lollipop.
It'll help you stay warm.

01:12:07.643 --> 01:12:09.849
I found something.

01:12:13.549 --> 01:12:17.916
See? I told you little hands go faster.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:26.271
Come on.

01:12:42.177 --> 01:12:44.400
This is just a third.

01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:46.835
This is nothing but his cut.

01:12:46.915 --> 01:12:49.918
He left my money behind.
It ain't gonna be enough.

01:12:52.488 --> 01:12:54.710
Okay, there were other ones,

01:12:54.790 --> 01:12:57.479
some other jobs he did for me.

01:12:57.559 --> 01:12:59.769
Where does he keep his money?

01:13:00.429 --> 01:13:03.018
We're both on the fucking list.

01:13:36.264 --> 01:13:38.003
Lilly?

01:13:49.311 --> 01:13:51.904
Sorry, cap, we're... we're closed.

01:13:51.984 --> 01:13:54.153
Where is she?

01:13:54.483 --> 01:13:57.942
Well, seems the poor girl
got herself into an accident.

01:14:01.557 --> 01:14:03.779
Don't surprise me none.

01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:06.088
I'm sorry?

01:14:06.168 --> 01:14:09.036
I said it don't surprise me.

01:14:10.966 --> 01:14:15.061
She's a... she talks like she's
the only one that's gonna be saved.

01:14:19.474 --> 01:14:21.163
Who's responsible?

01:14:21.243 --> 01:14:25.967
- Ain't nothing responsible for an accident.
- I said, who's responsible?

01:14:26.982 --> 01:14:30.737
You best remind Lilly,
there ain't no one walking this earth...

01:14:31.987 --> 01:14:33.742
who is saved.

01:14:33.822 --> 01:14:36.278
Then you tell me what you see.

01:14:47.536 --> 01:14:49.741
What do we do now?

01:15:06.021 --> 01:15:09.545
This was Ken's dream.
This is why he wanted the money.

01:15:09.625 --> 01:15:11.613
Jesus Christ.

01:15:11.693 --> 01:15:15.401
I really hate that I'm believing you,
just let me tell you that.

01:15:22.638 --> 01:15:26.661
He died for that patch of earth.
This just seems so fucking meaningless.

01:15:26.741 --> 01:15:29.631
Yeah, we'll all have
a good cry about that later.

01:15:29.711 --> 01:15:31.767
You see that?

01:15:31.847 --> 01:15:34.236
You see that? Come here.

01:15:34.316 --> 01:15:36.072
Look.

01:15:36.752 --> 01:15:38.373
Hear that?

01:15:38.653 --> 01:15:41.644
Who's that knocking at your door?

01:15:41.924 --> 01:15:43.411
- You hear that?
- Someday somebody is gonna

01:15:43.491 --> 01:15:47.147
put a bullet in that fucking
fat head of yours!

01:15:48.029 --> 01:15:52.554
You're just about 110 pounds
of bummer, ain't you? Come on.

01:15:52.634 --> 01:15:54.773
Give me that.

01:15:56.738 --> 01:15:58.995
Now, look, baby.

01:16:00.475 --> 01:16:02.798
This money is part yours too.

01:16:03.078 --> 01:16:05.501
Do you want it or not?

01:16:06.681 --> 01:16:10.307
Well, go find something
for us to break this ground.

01:16:12.087 --> 01:16:14.026
Go!

01:17:01.403 --> 01:17:03.875
Oh, goddamn it.

01:17:09.578 --> 01:17:11.186
Oh, Harry.

01:17:13.048 --> 01:17:15.193
Where is he?

01:17:16.652 --> 01:17:18.440
He got away!

01:17:18.520 --> 01:17:21.298
Leland? Oh, God!

01:17:22.224 --> 01:17:25.564
Jerry? Jerry, where are you?

01:18:12.607 --> 01:18:14.446
Come on!

01:18:21.516 --> 01:18:23.839
- You're not afraid of dying, are you?
- No!

01:18:23.919 --> 01:18:26.142
I'll get you there!

01:18:27.122 --> 01:18:29.294
Take me to Lilly!

01:18:43.839 --> 01:18:47.879
Hurry up! We don't have all night!

01:19:05.927 --> 01:19:08.251
<i>Wallace, are you there?</i>

01:19:09.781 --> 01:19:12.521
<i>Wallace? Wallace!</i>

01:19:17.739 --> 01:19:20.546
- <i>Wallace, are you there?</i>
- Marla...

01:19:26.548 --> 01:19:28.937
Wallace, come get me.

01:19:29.517 --> 01:19:31.589
<i>I can't.</i>

01:19:35.290 --> 01:19:37.954
I saw your name on that list.

01:19:39.611 --> 01:19:41.948
He's coming through here to get to you.

01:19:43.298 --> 01:19:47.022
<i>I'm gonna slow him down a bit
so you can disappear.</i>

01:19:47.102 --> 01:19:50.426
Wallace, don't... don't...

01:19:51.006 --> 01:19:53.128
<i>I always told you...</i>

01:19:53.208 --> 01:19:55.969
<i>that you deserve better, Marla.</i>

01:19:57.379 --> 01:19:59.852
But I never said I didn't love you.

01:20:07.656 --> 01:20:09.494
Wallace?

01:20:16.765 --> 01:20:19.207
Hey! What the hell you doing?

01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:27.763
<i>Guthrie...</i>

01:20:28.473 --> 01:20:32.450
that was his name, Harland Guthrie.

01:20:34.249 --> 01:20:36.821
First man I killed.

01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:41.476
Now I'm old and numb,
but that stinger's still in there,

01:20:41.556 --> 01:20:45.447
the kind of sorry that burns in you...

01:20:46.227 --> 01:20:50.152
for cutting the breath of one
of God's own creatures like that.

01:20:52.367 --> 01:20:54.723
Seeing you with her...

01:20:55.103 --> 01:20:57.827
like Harland looked at his wife...

01:20:59.107 --> 01:21:01.765
just days before he killed her.

01:21:03.445 --> 01:21:05.266
I've been wondering a lot about you.

01:21:05.346 --> 01:21:08.535
I've been thinking that,
you know, if you...

01:21:09.584 --> 01:21:13.309
if you fail them...

01:21:14.489 --> 01:21:16.844
if Shep goes on living like he does,

01:21:16.924 --> 01:21:20.163
then they won't hesitate to punish you.

01:21:21.429 --> 01:21:24.487
And they'll do to you
what you've been trying to do to him.

01:21:25.567 --> 01:21:27.989
They will erase you.

01:21:28.369 --> 01:21:32.023
And they'll erase all memory of you,
starting with her.

01:21:32.473 --> 01:21:35.196
With God by our side,
who can be against us?

01:21:35.276 --> 01:21:37.765
Come the morning hour...

01:21:37.845 --> 01:21:42.237
you'll reckon it's better
she dies by your hand

01:21:42.317 --> 01:21:44.672
than their cruel hooks.

01:21:44.752 --> 01:21:48.208
And then you'll be just like old Harland.

01:21:52.594 --> 01:21:56.223
I'll make the same deal tomorrow,
one just like it.

01:21:56.631 --> 01:21:59.388
Why don't you just leave with her?

01:22:15.984 --> 01:22:19.741
- You ain't gonna make it.
- Neither are you.

01:22:19.821 --> 01:22:23.210
Time to add a few more crosses
to Carrion Road.

01:22:40.275 --> 01:22:43.833
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.768
All right.

01:22:46.848 --> 01:22:49.454
I think we're a minute into your time.

01:22:53.488 --> 01:22:56.011
You gonna try something stupid again?

01:22:56.291 --> 01:22:58.013
No.

01:22:58.193 --> 01:23:01.427
Oh, yeah, it's a fucking
smelly zoo, isn't it?

01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:05.388
Don't worry, baby.
We're gonna get you stinking too.

01:23:06.468 --> 01:23:08.190
Come here.

01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:11.893
All right. Two hands.

01:23:11.973 --> 01:23:15.597
Okay, come on. Grab it, two hands.

01:23:15.677 --> 01:23:19.301
Okay. Now, what you want to do is,
you want to lift up.

01:23:20.081 --> 01:23:23.538
You want to put your shoulders into it,
and you bring it down.

01:23:23.618 --> 01:23:29.211
Real good. Come on, baby. Let's go.
You want your money, you got to earn it.

01:23:29.291 --> 01:23:32.893
Yeah, well, you can fucking keep it!

01:23:33.495 --> 01:23:35.300
God!

01:23:36.197 --> 01:23:37.971
God!

01:23:38.984 --> 01:23:41.741
Come back, you bitch!

01:24:17.138 --> 01:24:19.761
You're gonna finish off the list for me.

01:24:20.141 --> 01:24:24.349
First you're gonna cross out the girl,
then the salesman.

01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.659
If you know the girl don't belong,
why not let her go?

01:24:34.689 --> 01:24:39.347
Because it's not the true shape
of fidelity. Shit!

01:25:37.719 --> 01:25:39.958
I see you.

01:25:46.461 --> 01:25:48.666
Say it again.

01:25:52.634 --> 01:25:54.076
Wallace...

01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.498
Only killing I'll ever see again...

01:26:03.978 --> 01:26:06.217
is you killing me.

01:26:09.784 --> 01:26:12.190
And I don't even know your name.

01:26:15.523 --> 01:26:17.362
Wallace?

01:26:21.279 --> 01:26:24.102
You put this on yourself, son.

01:26:24.932 --> 01:26:27.766
You don't get to walk away
from this place.

01:26:29.704 --> 01:26:32.061
Don't got to be this way.

01:26:33.241 --> 01:26:36.331
Don't let it take you, huh?

01:26:36.411 --> 01:26:38.233
Wallace?

01:26:38.613 --> 01:26:41.338
Give me... give me the gun.

01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:46.374
Don't go down the path I did, Wallace.

01:26:46.604 --> 01:26:48.309
Huh?

01:26:50.091 --> 01:26:52.297
I see you.

01:26:54.562 --> 01:26:56.771
Good enough.

01:27:41.042 --> 01:27:43.563
It's gonna be all right.

01:27:44.946 --> 01:27:47.218
It'll be just fine.

01:27:49.484 --> 01:27:51.689
Now get out of here.

01:30:18.999 --> 01:30:22.389
I couldn't keep waiting for you, so...

01:30:24.105 --> 01:30:26.394
I like that you're here.

01:30:26.574 --> 01:30:31.147
After some thinking,
I decided I'd come and get you.

01:30:32.847 --> 01:30:35.620
You know, keep driving.

01:30:40.888 --> 01:30:43.978
- I like that.
- Get in the car.

01:30:48.162 --> 01:30:51.253
<i># So why should we fear #</i>

01:30:52.633 --> 01:30:56.125
<i># What travel brings? #</i>

01:30:57.505 --> 01:30:59.959
<i># What were we hoping #</i>

01:31:02.209 --> 01:31:04.990
<i># To get out of this #</i>

01:31:06.847 --> 01:31:13.905
<i># Some kind of momentary bliss #</i>

01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:19.298
<i># I waited for something #</i>

01:31:20.928 --> 01:31:23.753
<i># And something died #</i>

01:31:25.333 --> 01:31:28.388
<i># So I waited for nothing #</i>

01:31:30.438 --> 01:31:33.495
<i># And nothing arrived #</i>

01:31:34.875 --> 01:31:38.364
<i># It's our dearest ally #</i>

01:31:39.447 --> 01:31:42.471
<i># It's our closest friend #</i>

01:31:44.151 --> 01:31:47.643
<i># It's our darkest blackout #</i>

01:31:48.723 --> 01:31:52.063
<i># It's our final end #</i>

01:31:55.663 --> 01:31:57.701
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

01:32:03.371 --> 01:32:05.576
Morning, stupid.

01:32:21.822 --> 01:32:24.112
How'd you find me?

01:32:24.692 --> 01:32:26.481
Patience.

01:32:27.161 --> 01:32:31.418
And I'm telling you, boy,
when I get serious, I stay fucking serious.

01:32:33.467 --> 01:32:37.252
Times like these, you can't blame
a guy for trying to turn a dollar.

01:32:38.139 --> 01:32:40.227
Come on.

01:32:40.307 --> 01:32:45.249
I keep hearing these stories
about good people disappearing.

01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:50.905
If you're talking
about that offer I made...

01:32:51.485 --> 01:32:53.307
that still stands.

01:32:53.387 --> 01:32:55.109
Is that right?

01:32:55.189 --> 01:32:58.226
All you got to do
is let me walk out that door.

01:32:59.577 --> 01:33:01.778
Let me disappear.

01:33:02.597 --> 01:33:05.554
No such thing as disappearing, Shep.

01:33:06.734 --> 01:33:09.020
There's only dying.

01:33:10.337 --> 01:33:13.795
As far as good people go...

01:33:14.375 --> 01:33:18.035
I don't recall meeting one
that wasn't already dead.

01:33:29.073 --> 01:33:32.363
