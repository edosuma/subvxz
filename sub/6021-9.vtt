WEBVTT

00:06.906 --> 00:08.897
Any second now.

00:09.542 --> 00:11.203
It's light is on.

00:11.378 --> 00:12.845
Melissa, waffles are ready.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.675
Oh, fantastic. I'm starving.

00:19.552 --> 00:20.541
How about that?

00:22.000 --> 00:28.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:31.464 --> 00:33.557
She ate breakfast naked?

00:33.733 --> 00:35.462
She didn't even want a napkin.

00:36.269 --> 00:40.262
I've had bedroom naked,
I've had walk-to-the-bathroom naked.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.704
I have never had living-room naked.

00:43.109 --> 00:44.371
Oh, it's a scene.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.138
It's like you're living
in the Playboy Mansion.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.244
Did she--? Did she frolic?

00:50.417 --> 00:51.850
I don't have enough room.

00:53.520 --> 00:55.215
-Hey, Laney, Puddy.
-Hey.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.446
-Hi.
-Hey.

00:56.623 --> 00:59.285
-I gotta make a pit stop.
-Okay.

00:59.459 --> 01:00.517
Back together?

01:00.693 --> 01:04.459
His apartment was being fumigated.
We thought we'd give it another shot.

01:05.230 --> 01:08.223
So guess who called me last night?
Jason Hanky.

01:08.401 --> 01:11.165
"Stanky" Hanky? What did he want?

01:11.337 --> 01:14.101
He called to apologize
for standing me up five years ago.

01:14.274 --> 01:15.400
Why now?

01:15.575 --> 01:18.635
A.A. It's one of the 12 steps.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.746
Step number 9 is
you have to apologize...

01:20.914 --> 01:23.405
...to everyone you've ever wronged.

01:24.651 --> 01:28.485
I can't wait for Hanky
to come crawling back to me.

01:28.655 --> 01:30.122
Still with the neck hole?

01:30.290 --> 01:32.781
-Still upset. Very upset.
-What neck hole?

01:32.959 --> 01:35.018
Remember that party
he threw a few years ago?

01:35.195 --> 01:38.255
He had that very drafty apartment.
-I think on 9th Avenue--

01:38.431 --> 01:39.420
Faster.

01:40.567 --> 01:44.560
-I asked if I could borrow a sweater.
-A cashmere sweater.

01:44.737 --> 01:48.503
I said, preferably cashmere.
For warmth.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.370
I front of the whole party,
he says:

01:50.543 --> 01:53.671
"No. I don't want you stretching out
the neck hole."

01:54.547 --> 01:57.380
Oh, yeah, sure, laugh it up.
Everybody else did.

01:57.550 --> 02:00.951
Well, it's funny.
I mean, you have a big head.

02:02.889 --> 02:04.982
Or is it because of your neck?

02:05.158 --> 02:07.558
No, I think the head does
most of the stretching.

02:07.727 --> 02:11.060
Regardless, I had to walk around
for the rest of the party...

02:11.231 --> 02:15.565
...in some cheap MetLife Windbreaker.
Now it is payback time.

02:15.735 --> 02:19.227
-I really think it's the size of your neck.
-It's my head.

02:23.610 --> 02:25.635
-Hey, isn't this great?
-Hey.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.541
Since the nerds in Accounting
moved...

02:27.714 --> 02:29.545
...we're the only ones
in this bathroom.

02:29.716 --> 02:30.978
Yeah. Great.

02:40.126 --> 02:42.356
You went to the coffee shop
without me.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.724
I told you I just wanted to hop
in the shower.

02:44.898 --> 02:47.093
That's an hour ago.
What were you doing in there?

02:47.267 --> 02:49.667
Showering.
How long does it take you?

02:49.836 --> 02:51.701
-Ten minutes.
-Ten minutes?

02:51.871 --> 02:53.964
That's kooky talk.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.602
Elaine, how long do you spend
in the shower?

02:57.777 --> 02:59.540
-Ten minutes.
-Let me smell you.

02:59.712 --> 03:00.736
All right. Whiff away.

03:04.717 --> 03:05.945
It's not bad at all.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.515
-That's it.
-Okay.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.753
So get this. I'm in the bathroom
at work today...

03:12.926 --> 03:15.360
...and I see Peggy using
a seat protector.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.326
-So?
-We're the only women on the floor.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.295
I mean, we're like roommates.

03:20.466 --> 03:23.560
Would you use a seat protector
if you had a roommate?

03:26.539 --> 03:28.632
The damage is probably
already done.

03:28.808 --> 03:31.538
-All right. I'll get that.
-All right. It's just--

03:32.178 --> 03:34.112
Maybe she just practices
good hygiene.

03:34.280 --> 03:39.149
Yeah, you're right. She's probably one
of those neurotic clean freaks.

03:39.786 --> 03:43.654
Well, here's my shower routine.
Maybe I can make some changes.

03:43.823 --> 03:46.986
Yeah, wash cloth mittens
and maybe some liquid soap...

03:47.160 --> 03:49.958
...and just...focus.

03:51.831 --> 03:54.391
Zephyr? That is not a word.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.592
-Do you challenge?
-No, I do not challenge.

03:56.769 --> 03:59.135
Sixty-six points.

03:59.305 --> 04:02.502
I'd accuse you of cheating,
but where would you hide the tiles?

04:03.276 --> 04:05.676
-You want some more iced tea?
-Sure.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.447
Wrong pipe.

04:18.391 --> 04:19.449
So she coughed.

04:19.625 --> 04:22.288
Coughing? Naked?

04:23.029 --> 04:25.589
It's a turnoff, man.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.589
Everything goes with naked.

04:27.767 --> 04:31.100
When you cough, there are
thousands of unseen muscles...

04:31.271 --> 04:33.296
...that suddenly spring into action.

04:34.173 --> 04:36.505
It's like watching a fat guy
catch a cannonball...

04:36.676 --> 04:38.871
...in his stomach in slow motion.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.577
Oh, you spoiled, spoiled man.

04:42.749 --> 04:44.740
You know how much mental energy
I expend...

04:44.917 --> 04:47.511
...trying to picture women naked?

04:47.687 --> 04:51.384
But the thing you don't realize is
there's good naked and bad naked.

04:51.557 --> 04:56.290
Naked hair brushing, good.
Naked crouching, bad.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.731
-Hey, there's Hanky.
-All right, it's grovel time.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.334
Hey, George. Jerry.

05:03.503 --> 05:04.902
Listen, I just got sober...

05:05.071 --> 05:07.164
...so I've been going
through the 12 steps.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.706
What are you up to now? Step 9?

05:10.543 --> 05:12.841
Yeah. Making amends.

05:13.012 --> 05:14.775
Important step.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.472
Maybe the most important.

05:18.084 --> 05:21.247
Anyway, Jerry, you know,
this may sound dumb...

05:21.421 --> 05:24.322
...but when we first met,
I thought your name was Gary.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.152
I think I may even have called you
Gary a couple of times.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.989
I don't know if you noticed,
but I always felt bad.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.391
So I'm sorry.

05:31.564 --> 05:35.864
Thank you. I did notice
and I appreciate you rectifying it.

05:36.035 --> 05:38.401
Great. Great.

05:42.308 --> 05:44.833
Well, I'll see you guys later.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.114
Well, I just got out
of a 27-minute shower.

05:51.284 --> 05:54.014
I made some good cuts
and I didn't lose anything I needed.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.587
Yeah, I think what I kept is
even stronger now.

05:57.156 --> 06:00.057
-You've got some suds over here.
-What?

06:00.626 --> 06:02.457
Oh, man.

06:02.628 --> 06:06.120
Jeez. Look at that: I'm all lathery.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.631
Jerry, you gotta show me
what I'm doing wrong.

06:08.801 --> 06:12.032
-Oh, come on.
-No, I mean it, man. I'm lost.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.673
You promise you'll never come
in here again?

06:14.841 --> 06:17.935
Well, Jerry, you know I can't do that.

06:18.478 --> 06:21.538
My sense of it is you're probably
wasting time working piecemeal:

06:21.714 --> 06:25.707
-First cleaning one area, then another.
-Well, that's how cats do it.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.217
But when you have a faucet
instead of a tongue...

06:28.388 --> 06:30.413
...you wanna use gravity.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.387
Okay, let's turn the water on now.

06:32.558 --> 06:34.549
No, I told you. It's just a dry run.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.598
Hanky's moved on to Step 10.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.735
-He was taking personal inventory.
-That's Step 10?

06:42.902 --> 06:45.962
He has to do is count his blessings,
say a prayer and he's done.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.163
You believe this?

06:47.340 --> 06:49.774
Come on, Jerry,
how about a baggy swimsuit?

06:49.942 --> 06:51.910
No. You're not getting
any skin, Kramer.

06:52.812 --> 06:56.179
Well, this has all been
one big tease.

06:58.851 --> 07:01.547
These proofs look pretty good.

07:01.721 --> 07:04.019
Oh, can I move this?

07:05.992 --> 07:08.620
Yup. I think this will work.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.595
I'm gonna get another bottle
of water.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.858
Here, take mine. There's a little left.

07:15.034 --> 07:17.093
Oh, thanks, Walter.

07:28.514 --> 07:31.039
Guys, there's no doubt
that the pay is good.

07:31.217 --> 07:34.709
But I just don't know if I see myself
working with ice cream.

07:34.887 --> 07:36.320
You get pretty buff forearms.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.484
I don't know if I'm into that.

07:39.725 --> 07:42.319
-Oh, hello, Hanky, others.
-George.

07:42.495 --> 07:45.726
You know, Jason,
I couldn't help notice:

07:45.898 --> 07:47.456
I didn't get my apology.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.629
Apology? For what?

07:49.802 --> 07:53.135
A drafty apartment.
A sweaterless friend.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.742
A ball game giveaway
MetLife Windbreaker.

07:56.909 --> 07:59.571
George, come on.
Not that neck-hole thing.

07:59.745 --> 08:00.905
Yes, the neck-hole thing.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.071
I'd appreciate it
if you'd say you're sorry.

08:03.249 --> 08:06.707
No way. You would have
completely stretched it out.

08:06.886 --> 08:10.151
You're an alcoholic.
You have to apologize.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.814
Step 9. Step 9.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.095
All right, George, all right.
I'm sorry. I'm very, very sorry.

08:17.263 --> 08:20.994
I'm so sorry that I didn't want
your rather bulbous head...

08:21.167 --> 08:24.136
...struggling to find its way
into the normal-size neck hole...

08:24.303 --> 08:25.895
...of my finely knit sweater.

08:36.782 --> 08:41.082
Now, see, that's smart.
Constant motion.

08:43.089 --> 08:45.353
-Hey.
-Oh, yeah. I'm watching you too...

08:45.525 --> 08:47.789
...but this guy's really
showing me something.

08:49.428 --> 08:50.759
You got a steak?

08:50.930 --> 08:52.295
What happened to you?

08:52.465 --> 08:54.456
People in this city are crazy.

08:54.634 --> 08:55.726
Here you go.

08:55.902 --> 08:57.460
Thanks, buddy.

08:58.104 --> 09:02.131
Oh, yes. Yeah, you got any A.1.,
because I'm cooking a steak.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.969
-What?
-A different one.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.005
Okay, Jerry. I fixed that bike.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.274
That wasn't really necessary.
I don't ride it. It's just for show.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.651
I gotta clean those bearings.
Hold this.

09:14.520 --> 09:17.284
-Look at all that gunk.
-Please, don't crouch.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.716
-It caught my skin.
-Oh, that's bad.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.656
Especially that area.

09:22.828 --> 09:24.455
You got anything to snack on?

09:24.630 --> 09:26.598
Oh, pickles.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.165
It's a tough one.

09:33.339 --> 09:35.864
Please stop.
Let me help you with that.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.380
It's gonna leave a welt.
Look at that.

09:41.547 --> 09:44.607
I can't. I can't look anymore.

09:44.784 --> 09:47.275
I've seen too much.

09:49.889 --> 09:51.151
Peggy, we gotta talk.

09:51.324 --> 09:54.487
What is it about me
that you find so offensive?

09:55.528 --> 09:59.794
-You seem to be with a lot of men.
-What?

09:59.966 --> 10:02.764
I happen to have
a very steady boyfriend.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.669
You know, I mean,
we broke up a few times...

10:06.839 --> 10:10.570
...and there has been
an occasional guy here or there, but--

10:10.743 --> 10:12.335
Why is this your business?

10:12.511 --> 10:14.945
It's not. Good day.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.182
Oh, all right.
You think I've got germs?

10:18.351 --> 10:19.545
I'll give you some germs.

10:20.152 --> 10:22.120
How about some
for your keyboard, huh?

10:22.288 --> 10:24.153
How about that? Yeah?

10:24.323 --> 10:26.814
Oh, how about for your stapler?

10:27.560 --> 10:30.154
That's good, isn't it?
You have a happy and a healthy.

10:41.674 --> 10:43.539
Well, technically, he did apologize.

10:43.709 --> 10:47.076
Jerry, I felt like a straight man
in some horrible sketch.

10:47.246 --> 10:50.807
He was riffing. Riffing. On my pain.

10:50.983 --> 10:54.544
You want an apology for the apology
plus the original apology?

10:54.720 --> 10:56.415
That's right. I'm two in the hole.

10:57.523 --> 11:00.151
Well, I hit the wall yesterday
with Lady Godiva.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.920
She did a full-body flex
on a pickle jar.

11:03.963 --> 11:07.160
Did you explain about the good naked
and the bad naked?

11:07.333 --> 11:10.393
Where am I gonna get a fat guy
and a cannonball?

11:14.807 --> 11:17.742
Well, what if you showed her
bad naked, huh?

11:18.110 --> 11:20.408
-You still got that belt sander?
-Yeah.

11:20.579 --> 11:23.480
Well, you on all fours,
that thing vibrating...

11:23.649 --> 11:25.708
...kicking up sawdust.

11:25.885 --> 11:28.046
She'll get the picture.

11:30.890 --> 11:33.688
-Hello?
-<i>Jerry, guess where I'm calling from?</i>

11:33.859 --> 11:36.726
-World War I plane?
-<i>No, I'm in my shower.</i>

11:36.896 --> 11:38.955
I'm trying to get out
of the shower sooner.

11:39.131 --> 11:42.692
And then I asked myself why.
I mean, this is where I wanna be.

11:42.868 --> 11:45.496
I got a waterproof phone, I shaved,
I brushed my teeth...

11:45.671 --> 11:48.640
...and I ordered a pair of chinos
from J. Crew.

11:49.375 --> 11:53.539
-When are you getting out?
-I'm not. I'll see you later, buddy.

11:55.548 --> 11:58.278
Bad news, people.
Peggy is home sick.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.918
Oh, please.

12:00.086 --> 12:03.886
She's stuffed up, achy
and suffering from intense malaise.

12:04.056 --> 12:08.959
Oh, come on.
We all have intense malaise, right?

12:09.595 --> 12:12.029
I just spoke with her, Elaine.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.222
She's in bed.

12:13.399 --> 12:16.027
Yeah. Let me tell you something.
This is all in her mind.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.294
She is insane.

12:17.470 --> 12:20.871
She thinks I made her sick
because I coughed on her doorknob...

12:21.040 --> 12:25.500
...rubbed her stapler in my armpit
and put her keyboard on my butt.

12:27.313 --> 12:30.077
Yeah. She's a wacko.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.281
-So you're Jason Hanky's supervisor.
-Sponsor.

12:35.454 --> 12:38.355
Whatever. Listen, I'm very concerned
about this guy.

12:38.524 --> 12:41.357
He's doing very well.
He's already on to Step 10.

12:41.527 --> 12:42.858
If you don't do the steps...

12:43.028 --> 12:44.791
...you can go through them
pretty fast.

12:44.964 --> 12:46.761
You can get through six a day.

12:46.932 --> 12:49.366
Is there some unresolved issue
between you and Jason?

12:50.269 --> 12:53.397
I don't know, a little something called,
Step 9?

12:53.572 --> 12:58.032
Instead of an apology he was
bebopping and scatting all over me.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.171
I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

13:00.346 --> 13:01.870
Well, aren't you the boss of him?

13:02.047 --> 13:03.514
You shouldn't let him move up.

13:03.682 --> 13:06.116
When I was in Cub Scouts,
I got stuck on Webelos...

13:06.285 --> 13:09.482
...for three years because I kept losing
the Pinewood Derby.

13:10.156 --> 13:11.214
You're quite upset.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.620
I think you should drop him down
to Step 2.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.283
Admit there's a higher power?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.656
Yeah, let him chew on that
for a while.

13:18.164 --> 13:20.223
You know, George,
I think I can help you.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.629
We're having a meeting.
Why don't you come by?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.669
All right. That's more like it.
Thank you very much.

13:25.838 --> 13:29.774
By the way,
my uncle was an alcoholic.

13:34.680 --> 13:37.240
Lomez, you're not listening.
Jerry likes the naked.

13:37.416 --> 13:40.874
It's just some of the things
that she does when she's naked.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.446
Calm down. I'm on your side.

13:44.924 --> 13:46.721
Jeez. Hey, hold on a second.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.426
I got a clog. I'll call you back.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.297
-What are you doing?
-I found a spot on the kitchen floor.

13:58.470 --> 14:01.769
I thought I'd polish it up
with this belt sander I have here.

14:02.641 --> 14:05.701
No, not that. Why are you naked?

14:05.878 --> 14:09.609
-I thought naked is good.
-This isn't good naked.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.348
George, here have a seat.

14:17.256 --> 14:18.917
Where's Hanky?

14:20.426 --> 14:22.018
Okay, let's get started.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.185
Welcome to
Rage-aholics Anonymous.

14:24.363 --> 14:27.298
-What? Rage-aholics?
-George, this can help you.

14:27.466 --> 14:30.264
Hey, I am not here for rage.
I'm here for revenge.

14:30.436 --> 14:34.031
Excuse me. We have
a no-yelling policy at these meetings.

14:34.607 --> 14:39.306
Excuse me. Am I talking to you,
pinhead? Am l?

14:41.113 --> 14:43.445
Please, don't call me pinhead.

14:44.283 --> 14:46.012
I'm losing it.

14:47.853 --> 14:50.378
He took you to Rage-aholics?
Why?

14:50.556 --> 14:54.788
Probably because this whole universe
is against me.

14:55.127 --> 14:56.651
-You got a little rage.
-I know.

14:56.829 --> 15:00.993
And now, they want me to bottle it up.
It makes me so mad.

15:02.067 --> 15:04.661
By the way, my bad naked demo
didn't quite work.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.800
This bread has nuts in it.

15:08.641 --> 15:10.108
Oh, great, Elaine.

15:10.276 --> 15:11.743
What is wrong with my body?

15:11.911 --> 15:14.277
Chicken wing shoulder blades.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.739
-That's it?
-No, but that's one problem. Why?

15:17.917 --> 15:20.750
I was walking around naked
in front of Melissa the other day--

15:20.920 --> 15:23.115
Walking around naked?

15:23.289 --> 15:25.757
That is not a good look for a man.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.259
Why not?
It's a good look for a woman.

15:30.429 --> 15:34.763
Well, female body is a work of art.

15:34.934 --> 15:39.530
The male body is utilitarian.
It's for getting around. It's like a Jeep.

15:42.107 --> 15:45.770
-So you don't think it's attractive?
-It's hideous.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.210
The hair, the lumpiness.

15:49.381 --> 15:52.009
It's simian.

15:52.184 --> 15:54.778
Well, some women like it.

15:54.987 --> 15:56.887
Sickies.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.491
"Installing your Clarkman
garbage disposal.

16:01.660 --> 16:06.791
Dismantle latch hasp
beneath main drainage line."

16:06.966 --> 16:09.161
Oh, come on, Clarkman.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.335
-Puddy.
-Is David Puddy there?

16:17.509 --> 16:20.307
-This is Puddy.
-Oh, this is Kramer.

16:20.479 --> 16:21.810
I know.

16:22.281 --> 16:25.478
You're a mechanic. Could you help me
install a garbage disposal?

16:25.651 --> 16:29.815
You gotta dismantle the latch hasp
from the auxiliary drainage line.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.957
-No, it says main line.
-It's a misprint.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.592
-What do you got, a Clarkman?
-Yeah.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.660
I'll call you. I'll talk you through it.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.228
Oh, okay. Well, thanks, Puddy.

16:39.765 --> 16:42.325
-Hey, Puddy.
-Hey, babe, your boss called.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.366
You owe 5 bucks
for a balloon bouquet.

16:44.536 --> 16:47.699
Yeah, he says you can just give it
to him tomorrow when you see him.

16:47.873 --> 16:49.340
Balloon bouquet for who?

16:49.508 --> 16:51.169
Peggy took a turn for the worse.

16:52.711 --> 16:56.169
Peggy? Great.
I suppose she's still blaming me?

16:56.348 --> 16:57.576
-He said so.
-Yeah.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.615
I don't believe this woman.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.650
Talk to me, babe.

17:02.988 --> 17:04.546
She's this crazy woman...

17:04.723 --> 17:07.556
...who is convinced
that my germs make her sick.

17:07.726 --> 17:09.626
Oh, a germaphobe.

17:09.795 --> 17:11.694
I know what that's about.

17:14.500 --> 17:17.263
I'm a recovering germaphobe.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.598
Ten years.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.238
-What is this symbol?
-It's a germ.

17:26.444 --> 17:28.470
It was very nice of you
to bring the man...

17:28.647 --> 17:30.478
...you're sleeping with to talk...

17:30.649 --> 17:35.712
...but I assure you,
I don't have any problem with germs.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.947
Don't you? Elaine.

17:39.391 --> 17:40.983
Please.

17:41.160 --> 17:43.458
I know it looks bleak.
I've been there.

17:43.629 --> 17:46.097
Ten years ago, waking up
next to a woman liked this...

17:46.265 --> 17:48.756
...would have sent me running
for the pHisoHex.

17:49.568 --> 17:51.433
-Really?
-I still have trouble looking...

17:51.603 --> 17:54.970
...at those disgusting old bedroom
slippers she slobs around in.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.973
Hey, I've had those since college.
They're bunnies.

17:58.143 --> 18:00.338
They're bacteria traps.

18:00.512 --> 18:02.912
So you just learned to live with it?

18:03.082 --> 18:04.106
For the most part.

18:04.283 --> 18:07.844
Okay. We're broken up
for the rest of the day.

18:09.655 --> 18:11.748
So I'm glad we had a talk
and worked this out.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.119
-Don't you feel this is better?
-This is nice.

18:14.293 --> 18:17.194
Yes, clothes. This is normal.

18:17.963 --> 18:19.260
What are you doing tomorrow?

18:19.431 --> 18:22.229
I was thinking that we could go--

18:24.002 --> 18:25.367
Jerry?

18:25.971 --> 18:27.871
Jerry, are you listening to me?

18:28.040 --> 18:30.600
Yeah. What? I'm sorry.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.006
I wanted to know
what you were doing tomorrow.

18:34.246 --> 18:38.182
Maybe a haircut and I don't know,
maybe this and--

18:45.090 --> 18:46.387
So you broke up.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.492
We couldn't carry on
a conversation.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.389
I kept trying to picture her naked...

18:50.562 --> 18:52.996
...she kept trying
to not picture me naked.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.623
Hang on.

18:58.737 --> 18:59.795
So, what are you up to?

19:00.372 --> 19:02.738
Oh, just cooking up
a little thank-you for Puddy.

19:02.908 --> 19:05.172
Hey, how do you make
those radish roses?

19:05.344 --> 19:07.312
Insert a knife into the center
and twist.

19:07.479 --> 19:10.915
Then to make it bloom, soak it in water
for 30 to 40 minutes.

19:11.650 --> 19:13.743
No problem there.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.513
George, thanks for coming down
to talk.

19:18.690 --> 19:21.921
I wanted to see you right away,
but my hours here aren't so flexible.

19:22.094 --> 19:23.493
I just started yesterday.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.391
Well, I'm here. What is it?

19:25.864 --> 19:27.627
Well, I talked to my sponsor...

19:27.799 --> 19:30.461
...and I've thought it over
and you know...

19:30.636 --> 19:33.662
...my apology at the coffee shop
was sarcastic and rude...

19:33.839 --> 19:35.431
...and you deserve much better.

19:35.974 --> 19:38.169
Well, thank you.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.833
You're welcome.

19:40.245 --> 19:43.305
-Can I get a triple Minute Man Mint?
-Waffle or sugar cone?

19:43.482 --> 19:45.780
Excuse me, Jason.

19:47.719 --> 19:53.385
I don't wanna get into a big thing here
but I'm not sure if technically...

19:53.559 --> 19:58.087
...what you just said was actually
an apology.

19:58.263 --> 20:00.026
-What?
-Can you get on that cone?

20:00.199 --> 20:03.225
Would you hang on just a second?
What are you talking about?

20:03.402 --> 20:07.702
All you said was, "You're welcome."
Which is nice. It's very nice.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.364
But I feel I gotta get the apology.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.909
-Is there anybody else here but you?
-I'm alone and it's my second day.

20:14.079 --> 20:17.412
You know, I don't even think
we have that flavor, so--

20:17.583 --> 20:19.312
George, really, enough, okay?

20:19.484 --> 20:22.044
I admitted I was wrong.
What more do you want from me?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.950
-I want an apology.
-All right, look--

20:24.122 --> 20:26.386
-Did you try it?
-He doesn't know what he's doing.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.890
Oh, yes, I do. Yes, I do.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.928
I'm interacting with someone here,
if you can understand that.

20:32.097 --> 20:33.530
-Now, I'm sorry.
-There it is.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.634
You said it. That's what I want.
Say it again and tell it to me.

20:36.802 --> 20:40.363
I'm not saying anything to you.
I'm not sorry. I was never sorry.

20:40.539 --> 20:43.269
It was cashmere. I hate Step 9.

20:43.442 --> 20:46.036
Where's that Rum Raisin?
Where is it?

20:46.211 --> 20:49.908
I can't find anything. I need a drink.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.879
Daiquiri Ice. Here we go.

20:52.050 --> 20:53.176
What are you looking at?

20:53.352 --> 20:54.478
Get out. Come on.

20:54.653 --> 20:57.622
Can't you see we're closed?
Get out.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.818
This food is fantastic, Kramer.

21:02.995 --> 21:06.089
-And what a pretty radish rose, huh?
-Well, thank you.

21:06.265 --> 21:11.965
Well, here's to Peggy on her first week
of being germfree free.

21:12.437 --> 21:13.495
Yeah.

21:13.672 --> 21:16.766
And here's to David Puddy for helping
me install a much-needed...

21:16.942 --> 21:20.708
...and much-appreciated
garbage disposal in my bathtub.

21:21.613 --> 21:23.240
Yeah.

21:23.548 --> 21:25.539
You have a garbage disposal
in your bathtub?

21:25.717 --> 21:27.617
Oh, yeah, and I use it all the time.

21:27.786 --> 21:29.447
I made this whole meal in there.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.721
This food was in the shower
with you?

21:35.460 --> 21:37.018
I prepared it as I bathed.

21:39.164 --> 21:42.190
Oh, germs. Germs. Germs!

21:51.343 --> 21:53.504
Excuse me? Is this Rage-aholics?

21:53.679 --> 21:56.409
-No. Germaphobes.
-Thanks.

21:56.915 --> 21:58.246
What are you guys doing here?

21:58.417 --> 22:00.885
-Kramer.
-Right.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.152
Hi, I'm Jason.

22:04.890 --> 22:08.326
-I'm a Rage-aholic.
-Hi, Jason.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.558
-This is my first meeting.
-Step-skipper.

22:11.730 --> 22:15.496
That man is a step-skipper.
He skips Step 9.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.931
-Please, Step 9.
-That's right.

22:18.103 --> 22:19.400
He never apologized to me...

22:19.571 --> 22:23.268
...for saying that I would stretch out
the neck hole on his sweater.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.340
It wasn't funny.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.410
It was a very nice sweater.

22:27.579 --> 22:31.379
Take a look at his neck, not to mention
the melon sitting on top of it.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.348
I don't know if I'd trust him
with a V-neck.

22:35.387 --> 22:38.845
He's bebopping and scatting,
and I'm losing it.
