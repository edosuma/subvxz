18:48.261 --> 18:49.794
ASKING HIMSELF
THAT VERY QUESTION,

18:49.796 --> 18:51.229
DESPITE ALREADY
KNOWING THE ANSWER.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.597
WHICH IS...?

18:54.533 --> 18:56.667
YOU WANT SOMEONE
TO SHARE IN YOUR DREAMS,

18:56.669 --> 18:59.237
SO MUCH SO THAT YOU STOP
LISTENING TO THEIRS,

18:59.239 --> 19:01.839
AND ONE DAY, YOU TURN AROUND,
AND THEY'VE RUN AWAY TO PARIS.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.841
YOU MEAN, NEW YORK.

19:05.444 --> 19:06.911
NEW YORK.

19:06.913 --> 19:08.312
I MEAN, NEW YORK.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.714
OF COURSE.

19:14.520 --> 19:15.419
[SIGHS] WOW.

19:15.421 --> 19:18.689
<i>[RITA READS]: "SHE SEARCHED</i>
<i>HIS EYES FOR A SIGN,</i>

19:18.691 --> 19:19.889
<i>"A LOOK, A SMILE,</i>

19:19.891 --> 19:22.527

19:22.529 --> 19:23.727

19:31.871 --> 19:34.739

19:42.882 --> 19:45.750
YOU CAN'T RUN AWAY
FROM LIFE, DUCHESS.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.285
AND YOU CAN NEVER
RUN AWAY FROM LOVE.

19:48.587 --> 19:49.720
BUT I THINK
WE SHOULD RUN AWAY

19:49.722 --> 19:50.788
FROM THE EARL OF HAYWEATHER.

19:53.692 --> 19:56.327
[♪]

19:56.329 --> 19:57.895

19:59.831 --> 20:01.732
[HORSE WHINNIES]

20:06.638 --> 20:08.539
[SNORING]

20:10.609 --> 20:12.376
I THINK SHE WAS
UP ALL NIGHT

20:12.378 --> 20:14.245
READING YOUR BOOK.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.247
AH, THE TRANSFORMATIVE
POWER OF GREAT LITERATURE.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.615
SO, WHERE DO WE STAND
WITH DANNY BARRETT?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.250
RITA, WHAT DID
YOU FIND OUT?

20:19.252 --> 20:22.687
WELL, THERE ARE 167 DANIEL
OR D.H. BARRETTS

20:22.689 --> 20:24.222
IN THE GREATER
NEW YORK AREA.

20:24.224 --> 20:25.856
AND THERE ARE
200 SARAHS.

20:25.858 --> 20:27.758
I MEAN, THIS COULD
TAKE US DAYS.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.894
WE'VE GONE AS FAR
AS WE CAN, OLIVER.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.296
IT'S TIME
TO OPEN IT.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.237
WOW, DID
DANNY PAINT THIS?

20:39.239 --> 20:41.239
HE MUST HAVE, BUT...

20:41.241 --> 20:43.674
IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
HE SIGNED IT.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.810
HMM, "I'M SENDING
THIS GIFT TO YOU

20:45.812 --> 20:48.012
TO PROVE THAT
I FINALLY MADE IT."

20:48.014 --> 20:49.580
DANNY MUST HAVE
PAINTED IT.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.615
IF HE PAINTED THIS,

20:50.617 --> 20:52.650
HE MUST HAVE
PAINTED OTHERS.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.518
THEY MUST BE SOMEWHERE,
A GALLERY, OR A MUSEUM.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.254
I MET A MAN
WHO WAS A GENIUS

20:56.256 --> 20:57.855
AT USING OLD BIKE PARTS
AND USED TOASTERS

20:57.857 --> 20:59.724
TO MAKE AUTOMATIC CLOTHESLINES.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.565
AND HERE WE GO.

21:07.567 --> 21:09.600
AND?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.435
HE LIVED NEXT DOOR TO A GUY
WHO SOLD ALUMINUM SIDING.

21:11.437 --> 21:12.937
AND?

21:12.939 --> 21:14.739
AND HE WENT ON A BLIND DATE
WITH A GIRL WHO...

21:14.741 --> 21:16.007
OH, WHAT IS IT?

21:16.009 --> 21:17.808
NORMAN!

21:17.810 --> 21:19.310
UH...

21:19.312 --> 21:21.012
OH, HER SISTER WAS A CURATOR
AT AN ART GALLERY.

21:21.014 --> 21:23.281
TOUCHDOWN.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.383
IT'S A REMARKABLE PAINTING.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.450
ONE OF HIS FINEST.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.053
WE CAN'T FIND
WHERE DANNY SIGNED IT.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.588
IT'S HIDDEN RIGHT HERE
BY THE MOUNTAIN.

21:30.590 --> 21:32.323
THE ARTIST IS FAMOUS

21:32.325 --> 21:33.658
FOR HIDING SYMBOLS
IN HIS WORK,

21:33.660 --> 21:34.825
INCLUDING HIS OWN SIGNATURE.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.794
BUT THE ARTIST ISN'T BARRETT.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.329
IT'S A D.H. RUPRECHT.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.397
WHAT?

21:39.399 --> 21:40.597
SOMEONE ELSE PAINTED THIS?

21:40.599 --> 21:42.733
I CAN'T BELIEVE DANNY WOULD
SEND A PAINTING TO HIS FATHER

21:42.735 --> 21:43.801
BY SOMEONE ELSE,

21:43.803 --> 21:46.003
AND TRY TO PASS IT OFF
AS HIS OWN.

21:46.005 --> 21:48.739
MAYBE DANNY NEVER SUCCEEDED,
SO HE COULDN'T ADMIT IT.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.741
WELL, WHY SEND ANYTHING AT ALL?

21:50.743 --> 21:53.644
I DON'T THINK DANNY
WAS LYING ABOUT THIS.

21:53.646 --> 21:54.979
HE SAID HE WANTED TO
TELL HENRY ALL ABOUT IT.

21:54.981 --> 21:57.515
SO, WHO IS D. H. RUPRECHT?

21:57.517 --> 21:58.715
A VERY PROMISING
PAINTER

21:58.717 --> 21:59.884
WHO EXPLODED
ONTO THE NEW YORK ART SCENE

21:59.886 --> 22:01.085
A WHILE BACK.

22:01.087 --> 22:03.554
THIS IS A FINE EXAMPLE
OF HIS LATE WORK.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.655
HIS LATE WORK?

22:04.657 --> 22:06.357
YOU JUST SAID
HE WAS VERY PROMISING.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.726
RUPRECHT DIED IN A LOFT FIRE
ABOUT THREE YEARS AGO.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.394
MUCH OF HIS WORK
WAS DESTROYED,

22:10.396 --> 22:12.563
WHICH MAKES THIS PIECE
QUITE VALUABLE.

22:12.565 --> 22:14.699
I'D LIKE SOME PHOTOS,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.867
NO, PLEASE, BY ALL MEANS.

22:19.671 --> 22:22.807
SO, WHAT WAS DANNY DOING
WITH SUCH AN EXPENSIVE PAINTING?

22:22.809 --> 22:24.375
WELL, YOU SAID
YOUR FRIEND WAS A PAINTER?

22:24.377 --> 22:25.710
MM-HMM.

22:25.712 --> 22:28.546
STARVING ARTISTS OFTEN
PAY EACH OTHER WITH THEIR ART.

22:28.548 --> 22:29.714
MAYBE RUPRECHT TRADED THIS

22:29.716 --> 22:30.948
FOR ONE OF
YOUR FRIEND'S PAINTINGS.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.383
OH.

22:32.385 --> 22:33.984
MAKES SENSE THEY MIGHT
HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER.

22:33.986 --> 22:35.353
YOU SAID YOUR FRIEND
WAS FROM COLORADO?

22:35.355 --> 22:36.420
YES.

22:36.422 --> 22:38.055
SO WAS
RUPRECHT.

22:38.057 --> 22:38.956
ALWAYS PUT A MOUNTAIN
INTO HIS WORK SOMEWHERE.

22:40.492 --> 22:42.493
HOW OLD WAS D.H. RUPRECHT
WHEN HE DIED?

22:42.495 --> 22:43.994
YOUNG.

22:43.996 --> 22:47.098
ABOUT 26, 27.
VERY TRAGIC.

22:47.100 --> 22:48.132
I THINK WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

22:48.134 --> 22:50.401
AND I HOPE
YOU'RE WRONG.

22:50.403 --> 22:51.701
D.H. RUPRECHT.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.872
D.H... D.H...
DANIEL HENRY RUPRECHT?

22:54.874 --> 22:57.641
[TYPING RAPIDLY]
DANIEL HENRY BARRETT.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.514
WHAT?

23:03.516 --> 23:05.383
I CHECKED
THE PHONE RECORDS,

23:05.385 --> 23:07.151
TAX RECORDS,
REAL ESTATE RECORDS,

23:07.153 --> 23:08.452
BUT HE WAS SO YOUNG,

23:08.454 --> 23:11.155
I NEVER THOUGHT
TO CHECK THE OBITUARIES.

23:12.758 --> 23:15.059
"DANIEL HENRY BARRETT, 26,

23:15.061 --> 23:18.796
DIED THREE YEARS AGO
IN A LOFT FIRE IN SOHO."

23:18.798 --> 23:21.665
DANNY BARRETT
WAS D.H. RUPRECHT.

23:26.138 --> 23:28.706
SO, HENRY SPENT
THE PAST THREE YEARS

23:28.708 --> 23:32.676
BEING ANGRY AT A SON
WHO HE DOESN'T KNOW IS DEAD?

23:32.678 --> 23:34.745
[SIGHS] THAT'S SO SAD.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.547
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
WITH THE PAINTING?

23:36.549 --> 23:38.482
WE CAN'T RETURN IT
TO SENDER, OBVIOUSLY.

23:38.484 --> 23:39.517
OBVIOUSLY.

23:39.519 --> 23:41.085
THERE YOU ARE.

23:41.087 --> 23:44.121
I WANNA SHOW
YOU GUYS SOMETHING.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.121
PLEASE TELL ME

23:45.123 --> 23:47.024
YOU DIDN'T REMOVE
A VALUABLE PIECE OF ART

23:47.026 --> 23:48.324
FROM THE DEAD LETTER OFFICE

23:48.326 --> 23:51.195
AND BRING IT TO BREAKFAST
AT THE MAILBOX GRILLE.

23:51.696 --> 23:53.063
UH...

23:55.967 --> 23:57.802
OKAY.

23:57.804 --> 23:58.769
SO, LISTEN TO THIS.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.171
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT,

24:00.173 --> 24:02.006
DOING SEARCHES
ON D.H. RUPRECHT.

24:02.008 --> 24:02.906
AND GUESS WHAT?

24:02.908 --> 24:05.009
HE NEVER PAINTED
JUST ONE PAINTING AT A TIME.

24:05.011 --> 24:06.977
HE ALWAYS PAINTED
IN GROUPS OF THREES.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.579
TRYPTYCHS?

24:08.581 --> 24:11.182
YES, AND EVERY SET OF THREE
TOLD A STORY.

24:11.184 --> 24:13.951
SO, LIKE
MORNING, NOON AND NIGHT.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.619
OR CATERPILLAR,

24:15.621 --> 24:17.555
COCOON
AND BUTTERFLY.

24:17.557 --> 24:18.756
OR PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY!

24:18.758 --> 24:19.957
NO.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.692
NOT PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY.

24:21.694 --> 24:24.028
THEMES, NORMAN,
BIG THEMES,

24:24.030 --> 24:27.731
ABOUT LIFE, AND LOVE,
AND DEATH, AND HOPE.

24:27.733 --> 24:29.600
AND THEY WERE ALWAYS
SHOWN TOGETHER

24:29.602 --> 24:30.734
BECAUSE TWO WOULDN'T
MAKE SENSE

24:30.536 --> 24:31.569
WITHOUT THE THIRD.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.704
AND THIS PAINTING...

24:33.706 --> 24:35.906
THE ONE THAT'S...

24:35.908 --> 24:38.776
NOT HIDING UNDERNEATH
THE COFFEE TABLE RIGHT NOW.

24:38.778 --> 24:41.645
GOES WITH TWO OTHERS
THAT DANNY NEVER SOLD.

24:41.647 --> 24:43.547
AND SO FAR...

24:43.549 --> 24:44.548
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO LOCATE THEM.

24:44.550 --> 24:45.850
MAYBE THEY WERE DESTROYED

24:45.852 --> 24:47.184
IN THE SAME FIRE
THAT KILLED DANNY.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.619
MAYBE,

24:48.621 --> 24:50.855
BUT ALL THREE WERE
SHOWN TOGETHER JUST ONCE

24:50.857 --> 24:53.624
AT A GALLERY SHOW
BEFORE DANNY SENT THIS TO HENRY.

24:53.626 --> 24:55.092
HIS TRYPTYCHS
WERE ALWAYS PAINTED

24:55.094 --> 24:57.795
ON TALL,
RECTANGULAR CANVASES,

24:57.797 --> 24:59.964
SO THAT IT FELT LIKE

24:59.966 --> 25:01.232
YOU WERE LOOKING
OUT A WINDOW

25:01.234 --> 25:06.136
INTO THE PAST,
THE PRESENT, AND THE FUTURE.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.672
TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE
RIGHT THERE.

25:08.674 --> 25:09.673
WELL, THE FIRST ONE

25:09.675 --> 25:11.108
IS A MAN STANDING
NEXT TO A CAR,

25:11.110 --> 25:12.543
HOLDING
A LITTLE BOY'S HAND,

25:12.545 --> 25:13.978
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING IN
OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.013
DANNY AND HENRY, RIGHT?

25:16.015 --> 25:18.816
THAT WOULD BE DANNY'S PAST.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.251
THE SECOND ONE IS
A YOUNG MAN AND A WOMAN

25:20.253 --> 25:22.186
LOOKING AT EACH OTHER.

25:22.188 --> 25:23.654
WHICH I'M GUESSING
IS DANNY WITH SARAH,

25:23.656 --> 25:25.623
WHICH REPRESENTS
HIS PRESENT.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.691
NOW, TAKE A LOOK
AT THE THIRD ONE,

25:27.693 --> 25:28.726
DANNY'S FUTURE,

25:28.728 --> 25:29.793
THE ONE HE SENT TO HENRY,

25:29.795 --> 25:31.896
AND REMEMBER WHAT
THE CURATOR SAID

25:31.898 --> 25:33.097
ABOUT HIDDEN SYMBOLS.

25:33.099 --> 25:36.700
WELL, DANNY AND SARAH
ARE LOOKING OUT...

25:36.702 --> 25:38.102
WHAT IS THAT?

25:38.104 --> 25:38.969
IT'S TOO HARD TO SEE.

25:38.971 --> 25:40.571
THAT'S WHY...

25:41.740 --> 25:45.576
I BROUGHT THE ORIGINAL.

25:49.748 --> 25:52.883
WELL, THEY'RE LOOKING
WAY OFF INTO THE DISTANCE

25:52.885 --> 25:56.620
AT A TINY PERSON?

25:56.622 --> 25:57.688
A BABY?

25:59.691 --> 26:01.892
"THE BEST PART
OF YOU LIVES IN ME.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.661
AND THE BEST PART
OF BOTH OF US

26:03.663 --> 26:04.929
IS MY GIFT TO YOU."

26:04.931 --> 26:06.196
THAT'S DANNY'S FUTURE!

26:06.198 --> 26:08.065
I THINK HENRY
HAS A GRANDCHILD.

26:13.338 --> 26:14.705
WE CAN'T JUMP
TO CONCLUSIONS.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.307
WE HAVE TO FIND THEM
BEFORE WE TELL HENRY.

26:16.309 --> 26:17.808
I'LL GET RIGHT ON IT.

26:17.810 --> 26:20.044
MS. BRANDT,

26:20.046 --> 26:22.613
WHAT A PLEASURE TO SEE YOU
STILL SITTING AT MY DESK.

26:22.615 --> 26:23.681
AREN'T YOU LATE

26:23.683 --> 26:24.815
FOR YOUR HEALTH
AND SAFETY SYMPOSIUM?

26:24.817 --> 26:27.284
SHH! I'M ON THE LAST PAGE.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.620
DID YOU REALLY READ
ALL OF RITA'S BOOK?

26:29.622 --> 26:31.021
MM-HMM.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.723
ALL 780 PAGES?

26:32.725 --> 26:34.191
MM-HMM.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.026
BUT THE LAST PAGE
IS THE BEST.

26:36.028 --> 26:36.994
COME HERE, HONEY.

26:42.267 --> 26:44.802
"AS THEY FLOATED
OVER THE ROCKIES,

26:44.804 --> 26:46.770
"ALOFT IN THEIR
HOT-AIR BALLOON,

26:46.772 --> 26:48.272
"THE DUCHESS WHISPERED

"INTO MR. D'LORMAN'S
EXPECTANT EAR,

26:50.042 --> 26:51.375
"'LIFE IS FOR THE TAKING

26:51.377 --> 26:52.775
"'IF YOU ONLY

"'TO LISTEN TO THE BIDDING

26:59.118 --> 27:00.818
WOW.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.153
I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS SO DEEP.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.254
[CORA]; OH,
BUT YOU ARE DEEP.

27:04.256 --> 27:05.689
DEEP, DEEP, DEEP.

27:05.691 --> 27:06.624
YOU'RE DEEPER THAN YOU KNOW.

27:07.993 --> 27:09.093

27:09.095 --> 27:10.160
THAN NORMAN KNOWS,

27:13.231 --> 27:15.265
HOW DEEP ARE WE TALKING HERE?

27:15.267 --> 27:16.767

27:19.170 --> 27:20.170
NORMAN...

27:21.740 --> 27:23.107
WOULD YOU BE UPSET

27:23.109 --> 27:25.976
IF I ASKED YOU
NOT TO READ MY BOOK ANYMORE?

27:25.978 --> 27:27.077
OH.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.045
I'M NOT SURE.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.113
CORA SAID

27:29.115 --> 27:30.381
THAT IT WAS
REALLY ADDICTIVE,

27:30.383 --> 27:31.849
WHICH SOUNDS BAD,

27:31.851 --> 27:33.017
BUT THEN SHE SAID
THAT IT WAS INSPIRING,

27:33.019 --> 27:34.918
WHICH SOUNDS REALLY GOOD.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.353
AND THEN SHE SAID
IT WAS ALL ABOUT ME AND YOU.

27:38.256 --> 27:40.958
BUT THAT'S JUST SILLY, RIGHT?

27:46.398 --> 27:47.431

YOUR WHOLE HEART INTO THAT BOOK.

DANIEL HENRY BARRETT
MARRIED A SARAH ANN WILLIAMS

28:32.111 --> 28:33.310
IN NEW YORK CITY FIVE YEARS AGO.

IT'S THE RIGHT AGE,

28:34.346 --> 28:35.713

28:35.715 --> 28:36.914

28:45.024 --> 28:46.223

28:46.225 --> 28:47.191
SARAH WILLIAMS BARRETT
GAVE BIRTH

28:47.193 --> 28:49.927

28:49.929 --> 28:51.328

28:51.330 --> 28:52.396
AND THE ADDRESS
IS IN SARATOGA SPRINGS.

28:52.398 --> 28:54.031
SO THEY MUST HAVE
MOVED UPSTATE

28:54.033 --> 28:55.299
AFTER THE FIRE.

28:55.301 --> 28:58.268
WELL, THEN, THERE IT IS.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.138
IT'S TIME TO TELL HENRY
THAT HE HAS A GRANDCHILD.

29:02.907 --> 29:07.010
BUT FIRST, WE'LL HAVE TO
TELL HIM HE'S LOST HIS SON.

29:14.052 --> 29:15.853
SO IT WAS A FIRE?

29:15.855 --> 29:17.254
THE NEWS SAID

29:17.256 --> 29:20.190
IT WAS PROBABLY A COMBINATION
OF TURPENTINE AND RAGS

29:20.192 --> 29:22.226
IGNITED BY
AN OLD SPACE HEATER.

29:22.228 --> 29:24.194
OKAY.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.231
SO THAT PAINTING
THAT HE SENT ME...

29:27.233 --> 29:29.433
IT'S VERY GOOD,

29:29.435 --> 29:31.468
AND QUITE VALUABLE.

29:33.037 --> 29:35.806
THEN HE DID
MAKE A NAME FOR HIMSELF?

29:35.808 --> 29:36.940
I SURE GOT THAT WRONG.

29:36.942 --> 29:38.040
AT LEAST NOW YOU KNOW

29:38.042 --> 29:39.977
WHY YOU NEVER
HEARD FROM HIM AGAIN.

29:39.979 --> 29:44.014
HENRY, THAT PAINTING
WAS HIS FIRST ATTEMPT

29:44.016 --> 29:46.083
AT RECONCILING WITH YOU.

29:48.253 --> 29:50.387
AND THEN HE DIED,

29:50.389 --> 29:52.389
NEVER KNOWING
WHY I DIDN'T GET BACK TO HIM.

29:52.391 --> 29:54.191
HENRY...

29:54.193 --> 29:58.095
THE PAINTING
DANNY MAILED TO YOU,

29:58.097 --> 29:59.395
IT'S ONE IN A SERIES OF THREE

29:59.397 --> 30:01.865
THAT HE PAINTED
ABOUT HIS LIFE.

30:01.867 --> 30:05.068
THE FIRST WAS
OF YOU AND HIM.

30:05.070 --> 30:07.371
THE SECOND WAS
OF HIMSELF AND SARAH.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.473
BUT THE THIRD,

30:09.475 --> 30:12.109
THE ONE HE WANTED
YOU TO HAVE,

30:12.111 --> 30:15.045
WELL, IT WAS SORT OF
A BIRTH ANNOUNCEMENT.

30:15.047 --> 30:17.347
DO YOU SEE THIS?

30:17.349 --> 30:19.383
RIGHT HERE?

30:19.385 --> 30:20.918
YOU HAVE
A GRANDDAUGHTER, HENRY.

30:22.921 --> 30:24.054
HER NAME IS DANIELLE.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.390
SHE'S TWO YEARS OLD NOW,

30:26.392 --> 30:28.158
AND SHE LIVES
WITH HER MOTHER

30:28.160 --> 30:29.293

WHAT TO SAY.

30:34.366 --> 30:36.466

30:36.468 --> 30:39.036
I'VE LOST MY SON.

30:39.038 --> 30:40.437
HENRY, I CAN'T
EVEN IMAGINE

30:40.439 --> 30:43.207
WHAT YOU MUST BE
GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW,

30:43.209 --> 30:46.109
BUT THE LAST THING
DANNY PAINTED,

30:46.111 --> 30:48.846
I BELIEVE,
WAS A MESSAGE OF HOPE.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.514
IT WAS DANNY'S
WAY OF SAYING

30:50.516 --> 30:52.549
EVERYTHING YOU
TAUGHT HIM AS A BOY,

30:52.551 --> 30:54.017
HE USED,

30:54.019 --> 30:58.622
TO LEARN HOW TO BECOME
THE BEST MAN HE COULD BE,

30:58.624 --> 31:00.958
THE BEST ARTIST HE COULD BE,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.393
AND EVEN SOMEDAY,

31:03.395 --> 31:07.030
THE BEST FATHER
HE COULD BE.

31:07.032 --> 31:10.033
HE SENT YOU SO MUCH MORE
THAN A PAINTING, HENRY.

31:10.035 --> 31:13.337
HE SENT YOU A FAMILY.

31:15.139 --> 31:17.274
SO, WHAT DO I DO NOW THEN?

31:20.411 --> 31:22.412
WELL...

31:22.414 --> 31:25.616
YOU COULD ALWAYS
WRITE THEM A LETTER.

31:28.587 --> 31:31.388

31:34.460 --> 31:36.660

31:38.296 --> 31:39.429

[SIGHS HEAVILY]

39:05.042 --> 39:06.609
YOU'VE DONE A WONDERFUL THING.

39:06.611 --> 39:08.812
PLEASE, ACCEPT
MY APOLOGIES

39:08.814 --> 39:10.980
FOR EVER HAVING DOUBTED YOU.

39:10.982 --> 39:14.084
YOU'RE EASY
TO FORGIVE, OLIVER.

39:14.086 --> 39:16.853
WELL, UH, PERHAPS NOT
AFTER MY NEXT APOLOGY.

39:16.855 --> 39:19.756
I'VE GIVEN IT
A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT,

39:19.758 --> 39:21.056
AND I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST

39:21.058 --> 39:25.930
IF WE... DIDN'T DANCE TOGETHER
AT THE SHOWCASE TONIGHT.

39:26.932 --> 39:28.631
WHAT?

39:28.633 --> 39:29.966
WHY?

39:29.968 --> 39:33.803
WELL, THERE'S REALLY
NO REASON TO CONTINUE NOW.

39:33.805 --> 39:36.539
I MEAN, I'VE ACCOMPLISHED
WHAT I SET OUT TO DO.

39:36.541 --> 39:39.075
I'M SORRY, ACCOMPLISHED WHAT?

39:39.077 --> 39:42.479
I ONLY EVER INTENDED
TO TAKE A FEW LESSONS.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.849
UM, YOU SEE, UH...

39:45.851 --> 39:47.050
MY WIFE

39:47.052 --> 39:49.719
SURPRISED ME
A FEW YEARS AGO

39:49.721 --> 39:51.821
WITH A GIFT CERTIFICATE
FOR 10 LESSONS,

39:51.823 --> 39:54.958
AND I BELIEVE

39:54.960 --> 39:58.528
IT WAS MY RELUCTANCE
TO TAKE THOSE CLASSES

39:58.530 --> 40:03.099
THAT CONTRIBUTED TO
HER OVERALL...

40:03.101 --> 40:05.168
DISSATISFACTION.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.538
I SEE.

40:08.540 --> 40:12.909
SO, IN THE EVENT
THAT SHE SHOULD TIRE OF PARIS

40:12.911 --> 40:14.177
AND RETURN TO DENVER,

40:14.179 --> 40:16.713
THEN YOU'LL BE READY TO...

40:16.715 --> 40:18.181
DANCE WITH HER.

40:18.183 --> 40:19.416
YES,

40:19.418 --> 40:21.584
I HOPE SO.

40:23.087 --> 40:26.790
THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.

40:28.926 --> 40:31.694
YOU WERE A WONDERFUL PARTNER.

40:34.999 --> 40:35.999
SURE.
