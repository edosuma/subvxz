10:49.692 --> 10:51.563
Okay, which guards?She doesn't know
their names,

10:51.607 --> 10:53.435
but if she sees them,
she'll recognize them.

10:53.478 --> 10:55.089
Oh, so you want me
to let her look

10:55.132 --> 10:56.743
at the guards and see
if she recognizes anyone?Yes, please.

10:56.786 --> 10:59.571
Look, I want to assist you
in any way I can...
Good.

10:59.615 --> 11:00.834
...but, unfortunately,
that's not something

11:00.877 --> 11:03.488
I can do without a warrant.

11:03.532 --> 11:05.055
I have to protect the
civil rights of my employees.

11:05.099 --> 11:06.840
What about the human rights
of your detainees?

11:06.883 --> 11:09.538
You protecting those, too?

11:09.581 --> 11:13.455
Unfortunately,
my hands are tied.

11:13.498 --> 11:16.763
Thank you so much, Mr. Bell.
You've been very helpful.

11:16.806 --> 11:17.938
I'll be in touch.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.818
How can you just
give up like that?

11:28.862 --> 11:32.343
I didn't just give up.
I strategically backed off.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.737
Trust me, nobody uses the
"you need a warrant" excuse

11:34.781 --> 11:36.739
unless they're hiding something.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.486
You know, my parents
were refugees.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.923
I didn't know that.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.752
Yeah, my father was
a university professor in Iran.

11:49.796 --> 11:52.581
He and my mother fled
during the revolution.

11:52.624 --> 11:54.104
They were constitutionalists

11:54.148 --> 11:56.193
and they believed in the
separation of church and state,

11:56.237 --> 11:58.369
so that made them targets
for the new regime.

11:58.413 --> 12:01.111
They were granted asylum?Yeah.

12:01.155 --> 12:04.593
They were welcomed here
with open arms.

12:04.636 --> 12:07.857
They became citizens. My father
continued his teaching career.

12:07.901 --> 12:09.946
They built a life here.
They raised a family.

12:09.990 --> 12:13.297
That was a different time.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.256
I can't imagine what my life
would've been like

12:15.299 --> 12:19.042
if their asylum claims
had been denied.

12:19.086 --> 12:20.348
[cell phone chimes]

12:22.916 --> 12:24.961
Here we go.

12:25.005 --> 12:28.704
I've been granted access to the
FBI investigation into Duvall.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.011
What was the outcome?

12:31.054 --> 12:33.404
[sighs]

12:33.448 --> 12:36.016
There wasn't one.

12:36.059 --> 12:37.800
Case was closed
without explanation

12:37.844 --> 12:39.454
a little over
a year ago.

12:39.497 --> 12:40.890
Well, that isn't much help.

12:40.934 --> 12:43.023
No, but this might be.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.851
Agent in charge
of the case...

12:44.894 --> 12:47.854
Raymond Isler.

12:51.248 --> 12:53.555
PRIDE: You're a very difficult
man to track down.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.383
And yet, here you are.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.648
What the hell
are you doing out here?

12:59.691 --> 13:01.737
Gone fishing.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.348
[both chuckle]Yeah, I can see that.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.698
Anything biting?

13:06.742 --> 13:10.006
Oh, man, I seem to have
better luck at, uh,

13:10.050 --> 13:13.009
hooking these old boots
than I do fish.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.446
Well, you may need
to change your bait.

13:15.490 --> 13:19.189
Nothing seems to work.
You'd think I'd give up.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.409
How long you been out here,
Raymond?

13:21.452 --> 13:23.150
Since we left South Ossetia.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.588
I got shot twice, Dwayne.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.025
Not as young as I used to be.

13:29.069 --> 13:31.811
Well, that's something
I can relate to.

13:31.854 --> 13:35.031
Yeah. I've been down
this road before.

13:35.075 --> 13:38.861
I didn't want to risk
backsliding into addiction.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.863
You didn't use painkillers?

13:40.907 --> 13:43.779
Mm-mmm.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.912
Not this time.

13:45.955 --> 13:48.349
Raymond, you didn't
have to do that.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.830
I think I did.

13:52.048 --> 13:54.964
Six months
is a long time

13:55.008 --> 13:58.402
to be out here
fishing for old boots.

13:58.446 --> 13:59.882
JIMMY:
Thanks for coming back.

14:01.928 --> 14:03.668
You're worried about Dwayne?Yeah.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.192
I don't know,
maybe I shouldn't be.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.802
I mean, he's same old Dwayne,

14:06.846 --> 14:09.065
solid as a rock.
But...

14:11.589 --> 14:13.940
But he's burning the candle
at both ends.

14:13.983 --> 14:17.552
Like this morning, he was down
here first thing, you saw him.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.075
Mm, he seemed fine.

14:19.119 --> 14:20.772
I know,
but he closed up last night.

14:20.816 --> 14:22.600
He wouldn't have finished
till 3:30, 4:00 a.m.

14:22.644 --> 14:24.080
That's late.

14:24.124 --> 14:25.952
Yeah. I don't know
when he sleeps.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.301
Thank you.

14:27.344 --> 14:29.956
Even when he's not
down here in the bar,

14:29.999 --> 14:32.697
I hear him rattling
around upstairs

14:32.741 --> 14:35.004
like a-a marble in a shoebox.
Thank you.

14:37.572 --> 14:40.357
Dwayne's been
through a lot.

14:40.401 --> 14:43.970
That's why I wanted
your opinion, as a doctor.

14:44.013 --> 14:47.974
Look, different people

14:48.017 --> 14:50.715
deal with trauma
in very different ways.

14:50.759 --> 14:52.500
There's no right
or wrong to it.

14:52.543 --> 14:55.851
And Dwayne's
a very strong man.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.810
He tends to keep
his own counsel.

14:58.854 --> 14:59.986
And that's okay?

15:00.029 --> 15:03.728
Well, I should tell you

15:03.772 --> 15:05.948
that I've been concerned
about him myself.

15:05.992 --> 15:09.430
He reached out to me
a while back.

15:09.473 --> 15:12.041
I gave him the name
of someone to contact

15:12.085 --> 15:13.651
to help him with his trauma.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.697
Well, how'd that go?

15:15.740 --> 15:18.874
I don't know.
He hasn't said a word about it,

15:18.918 --> 15:22.399
which is fine, he doesn't
have to confide in me,

15:22.443 --> 15:26.273
but if he's not
talking to someone,

15:26.316 --> 15:28.275
that's a problem.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.106
ISLER:
Something tells me

15:33.149 --> 15:35.543
you didn't come down
to hear my thoughts

15:35.586 --> 15:39.025
on my own mortality.

15:39.068 --> 15:42.115
I wanted to talk to you
about an investigation

15:42.158 --> 15:44.334
that you launched
down here last year.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.032
Go ahead.

15:46.075 --> 15:49.035
Human trafficking out of
the Duvall Detention Center.

15:49.078 --> 15:52.212
Case went cold.

15:52.255 --> 15:53.648
What happened?

15:53.691 --> 15:55.867
Well, we had
credible allegations

15:55.911 --> 15:58.044
that about two dozen
female detainees disappeared

15:58.087 --> 15:59.567
without a trace
from this facility

15:59.610 --> 16:01.221
over about
a six-month period.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.874
That's a big volume.
Yeah.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.964
They have everything they need
right at their fingertips:

16:05.007 --> 16:07.053
steady stream of victims
coming through their facility,

16:07.096 --> 16:09.620
plausible deniability
when they turn up missing.

16:09.664 --> 16:11.187
So how'd it go south?

16:11.231 --> 16:12.623
Well, somehow they got wind
of our investigation,

16:12.667 --> 16:14.016
they put walls up.

16:14.060 --> 16:16.062
Suddenly, paperwork
went missing,

16:16.105 --> 16:18.760
women were classified
as released or escaped.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.196
We couldn't
prove anything.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.198
I didn't have any
witnesses or victims.

16:22.242 --> 16:23.634
Just went cold.

16:25.245 --> 16:26.811
I take it
they're back at it?

16:26.855 --> 16:29.031
Looks that way.

16:29.075 --> 16:30.598
See, the thing is,

16:30.641 --> 16:33.470
FBI has
the primary jurisdiction.

16:33.514 --> 16:35.168
[chuckles]

16:35.211 --> 16:37.039
What's your status?

16:39.302 --> 16:41.043
I'm still an agent,

16:41.087 --> 16:44.220
but on a leave
of absence.

16:44.264 --> 16:45.830
I was hoping that you could

16:45.874 --> 16:48.224
reopen your investigation,
loop us in.

16:52.098 --> 16:54.491
Yeah.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.232
I could do that.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.627
You sure?

17:02.282 --> 17:04.284
It's unfinished business.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.899
OFFICER: Sure, I know him.
That's Zeke Dalton.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.466
We dry him up
in the drunk tank

17:12.509 --> 17:14.294
every few months or so
when he gets rowdy.

17:14.337 --> 17:16.687
Yeah, well, the credit card
that he's using in this photo

17:16.731 --> 17:18.124
belongs to a missing person.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.995
Zeke's your garden variety
homeless drunk.

17:20.039 --> 17:22.041
He's not the violent type.Well, that's
good to know,

17:22.084 --> 17:24.043
but we'd like to ask him
some questions.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.131
Yeah. Do you know where
we could find him?

17:25.174 --> 17:26.697
Like I said,
Zeke's homeless,

17:26.741 --> 17:28.134
but he's a creature of habit,

17:28.177 --> 17:30.179
so you'll find him
in one of his regular haunts.

17:30.223 --> 17:32.138
You care to show us?Happy to help.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.490
GREGORIO:
Isler, hello!

17:36.533 --> 17:39.188
Ooh, are we--
are we hugging now?

17:39.232 --> 17:41.277
Hi. Well, it's this town.
It gets to you.

17:41.321 --> 17:43.149
And all this time you've been
right in my own backyard.

17:43.192 --> 17:44.933
What's the big idea?I'll make it up to you.

17:44.976 --> 17:47.892
Already has.
Straight from the FBI.

17:50.025 --> 17:52.158
What're we looking at?We have access to records

17:52.201 --> 17:53.550
for certain
Duvall employees.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.770
He got us a Title III
warrant and wire taps.

17:55.813 --> 17:58.338
Wow.
Not bad for a guy
who's gone fishing.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.948
I may be out of the loop,

17:59.991 --> 18:01.428
but I still have a few friends
in high places.

18:01.471 --> 18:04.083
Hey, this guy, Samuel Barnes,
is our target.

18:04.126 --> 18:07.042
Employment records show that
he drives a van for Duvall,

18:07.086 --> 18:10.263
but his financials stand out,
some big deposits popped.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.395
You got one shot
at this.

18:12.439 --> 18:15.355
You lose this guy, they'll
shut down their operation.

18:18.488 --> 18:21.187
Got your bank records, Sam.

18:21.230 --> 18:24.712
How you managing
to do what you do?

18:24.755 --> 18:26.235
What do you mean?

18:26.279 --> 18:29.978
New car, new boat.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.458
Nice ones, too.

18:31.501 --> 18:32.894
GREGORIO: Nobody makes
that kind of money

18:32.937 --> 18:35.201
driving a van.
What's your secret?

18:35.244 --> 18:37.333
Nothing.

18:37.377 --> 18:39.901
I mean, my wife, she-she came
into an inheritance,

18:39.944 --> 18:42.512
and I guess I had a good run
on the tables, you know?

18:42.556 --> 18:46.951
Seriously? How fast do you think
that story's gonna unravel?

18:46.995 --> 18:49.084
I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.477
Sure you do.Thing is,

18:50.520 --> 18:52.087
you could totally make
"new car, new boat" money

18:52.131 --> 18:54.698
if you were driving a van
for human traffickers.

18:57.527 --> 18:59.573
You got nothing on me.

19:03.359 --> 19:05.361
You could make this
really easy, Sam.

19:05.405 --> 19:08.408
All you got to do
is talk to us.

19:08.451 --> 19:11.193
This whole operation's
about to be shut down.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.368
You don't start talking,
you're gonna be

19:12.412 --> 19:13.804
hung out to dry
by the people at the top.

19:13.848 --> 19:16.677
Yeah, those big guys
are not gonna look out for you.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.201
If that were true,
you would've arrested me.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.550
Is that what's happening here?

19:20.594 --> 19:22.596
Am I being arrested,
or am I free to leave?

19:22.639 --> 19:25.251
We're not sure yet.

19:25.294 --> 19:28.428
Well, if you are arresting me,
then I want a lawyer.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.212
I got nothing else to say.

19:30.256 --> 19:33.694
Now, we're not done here.Yeah, we are.

19:35.304 --> 19:37.263
We're not cutting
this scumbag loose.

19:37.306 --> 19:39.352
He invoked
his right to counsel.I'm not done here.

19:39.395 --> 19:41.484
Stand down.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.486
You're free to go.

19:51.277 --> 19:53.409
Go.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.152
PRIDE:
I'll call you back.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.427
Think we hooked him?

20:23.744 --> 20:26.137
PATTON:
Wire taps set up,

20:26.181 --> 20:28.705
and we are live.

20:28.749 --> 20:30.794
So this is Barnes.Just starting to dial.

20:30.838 --> 20:32.579
BARNES [over computer]:
Hey, honey.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.407
MRS. BARNES: What's wrong?
Why are you calling me

20:34.450 --> 20:36.104
in the middle of the day?His wife.

20:36.147 --> 20:39.020
BARNES: Listen, I need you
to withdraw that $2,000 we have.

20:39.063 --> 20:40.891
Get cash. And y-you call
my cousin, Larry, you know,

20:40.935 --> 20:42.763
the lawyer, I need
to get in touch with him.

20:42.806 --> 20:44.547
MRS. BARNES: What the hell, Sam?
What's going on?

20:44.591 --> 20:46.114
BARNES: Nothing. I'm just asking
you to do some things.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.724
I've got to go.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.596
Okay, standard first call.

20:49.639 --> 20:51.685
He's on the hook and things
are starting to unravel.

20:51.728 --> 20:53.904
His wife's a good start,
but a dead end.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.603
Okay, he's dialing again.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.605
[line ringing]Mark Keeling.

20:58.648 --> 21:01.608
He's a guard at Duvall.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.697
Guy's got priors in Louisiana.

21:03.740 --> 21:04.872
KEELING:
Mark.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.308
BARNES: They told me
I'm being watched.

21:06.352 --> 21:07.744
BARNES: Like I'm doing something
wrong or something,

21:07.788 --> 21:09.616
because of how
I'm spending my money.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.226
KEELING:
They got your financial records?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.663
BARNES:
Yeah, I-I guess. I don't know.

21:13.707 --> 21:15.317
T-They must have.

21:15.361 --> 21:16.884
But I-I didn't admit nothing.

21:16.927 --> 21:18.320
That's not entirely true.

21:18.364 --> 21:19.452
KEELING:
You better not have.

21:19.495 --> 21:20.888
BARNES:
So you think I'm in trouble?

21:20.931 --> 21:22.846
KEELING:
I think I don't want you
driving right now.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.674
Not for a while.

21:24.718 --> 21:26.241
Sounds like Keeling's his boss.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.461
Exactly. Now we need to follow
Keeling's calls

21:28.504 --> 21:29.897
and figure out who his boss is.

21:29.940 --> 21:32.769
And keep working our way
up the food chain.

21:44.738 --> 21:45.739
That's him.

21:47.393 --> 21:48.698
Federal agents!

21:48.742 --> 21:49.699
We got a rabbit!

21:49.743 --> 21:51.745
Seriously?

22:00.710 --> 22:02.582
Where do you think you're going?

22:04.758 --> 22:06.107
We know you stole the card.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.370
I didn't.You want me to throw
the book at you?

22:08.414 --> 22:10.198
Because right now, you are
looking at theft, fraud,

22:10.241 --> 22:11.721
drunk and disorderly
and resisting arrest.

22:11.765 --> 22:13.549
I didn't...

22:13.593 --> 22:15.029
This is no joke, Zeke.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.379
Hey. Hey, it's okay.

22:19.425 --> 22:20.774
Come on. Here.

22:26.345 --> 22:29.304
I didn't steal it.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.046
I know how it looks,
but I didn't.All right.

22:32.089 --> 22:34.831
You've had some rough times.

22:34.875 --> 22:37.573
I understand.
I know how it happens.

22:37.617 --> 22:40.402
My brother, Cade,
the one we're looking for,

22:40.446 --> 22:42.186
he was homeless
for a while.

22:42.230 --> 22:44.711
Yeah? But he-he's not anymore?

22:44.754 --> 22:45.973
No, he isn't.

22:46.016 --> 22:47.975
He's doing real good.

22:48.018 --> 22:51.457
He takes medication to
stay on an even keel.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.806
That's good.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.852
So where'd you get
the card, Zeke?

22:56.853 --> 22:58.768
Did my brother
give it to you?

22:58.812 --> 23:01.336
'Cause sometimes he forgets
to take his medication,

23:01.380 --> 23:02.729
and he gets all manic,

23:02.772 --> 23:05.427
he just gives
everything away.

23:05.471 --> 23:06.733
You got it from him, didn't you?

23:06.776 --> 23:09.170
I told you, I found it.

23:09.213 --> 23:12.086
Out in the woods near this spot
where I make camp sometimes.

23:12.129 --> 23:14.349
You just, you found
a credit card out in the woods?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.307
It was, it was in a wallet,

23:16.351 --> 23:17.744
along with a few bucks.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.746
I took the cash,

23:19.789 --> 23:22.357
figured I could use the card
before it got shut off.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.750
Used it to buy some beer.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.142
What'd you do with the wallet?

23:25.186 --> 23:27.493
Nothing else in it I could use,
so I left it.

23:27.536 --> 23:28.798
Show me.

23:30.800 --> 23:33.107
HANNAH:
According to the
Title III warrant,

23:33.150 --> 23:34.804
Duvall was approved
for its first ICE contract

23:34.848 --> 23:36.719
only about two years ago.

23:36.763 --> 23:38.765
Business is booming for all
these private facilities.

23:38.808 --> 23:41.332
It's a growth market.

23:41.376 --> 23:44.118
It's so hard to think about this
as a for-profit industry.

23:44.161 --> 23:45.815
It's big business.

23:45.859 --> 23:48.252
ICE can only do so much with
the resources they have.

23:48.296 --> 23:49.384
ELENA:
I'm sorry
to interrupt.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.431
I just want
to thank you.

23:52.474 --> 23:54.998
I'm being called back to base
this afternoon, and just...

23:55.042 --> 23:57.784
Thank you.Are you okay?

23:57.827 --> 23:59.176
Yeah, I'm good.

23:59.220 --> 24:00.526
What about your dad?
Wasn't he swept up with you?

24:00.569 --> 24:03.050
Yeah.Is he okay?

24:03.093 --> 24:05.835
I was able to figure out
where he's being detained.

24:05.879 --> 24:07.663
They're holding him
out in Pine Prairie

24:07.707 --> 24:09.926
and I'm working
on getting him a lawyer.

24:09.970 --> 24:11.450
Were you able to see him?

24:11.493 --> 24:12.842
No visitors.

24:14.844 --> 24:17.673
My dad's been a target for ICE
my whole life.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.633
He fled Honduras, he
left everything behind.

24:20.676 --> 24:21.938
His home, his family.

24:21.982 --> 24:23.113
Why'd he leave?

24:23.157 --> 24:25.507
He was a journalist.
He wrote articles

24:25.551 --> 24:28.510
critical of the corruption
of the government.

24:28.554 --> 24:30.947
When was this?Early '90s.

24:30.991 --> 24:33.689
The first time he came,
his asylum claim was denied.

24:33.733 --> 24:35.343
He didn't leave
right away.

24:35.386 --> 24:37.824
And then, your dad...
eventually, he was deported?Yeah.

24:37.867 --> 24:41.828
When I was seven,
they sent him back.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.656
He was tortured.

24:43.699 --> 24:45.788
But he lived
and eventually,

24:45.832 --> 24:47.834
he made it his way back
to the United States

24:47.877 --> 24:50.184
and he's applying
for asylum again.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.316
He must be proud of you.

24:52.360 --> 24:55.319
He is. He missed a lot,
but he loves saying

24:55.363 --> 24:58.540
his daughter's
in the United States Navy.

24:58.584 --> 25:00.673
He loves this
country.

25:00.716 --> 25:02.718
His asylum claim sounds strong.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.199
It's a long shot.

25:05.242 --> 25:07.288
They all are these days.

25:07.331 --> 25:09.246
ICE is changing the rules
all the time.

25:09.290 --> 25:12.162
And now they're threatening
to send back asylum seekers

25:12.206 --> 25:15.601
while their hearings
are still pending.

25:15.644 --> 25:17.472
I don't know
where he'd go.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.518
He can't go back.

25:22.346 --> 25:23.826
I admire you, Raymond.

25:24.914 --> 25:28.265
What you've done,
your recovery.

25:28.309 --> 25:29.789
Thank you.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.312
Couldn't have been easy.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.402
Facing this pain,

25:34.445 --> 25:36.709
it's the hardest thing
I've ever done in my life.

25:36.752 --> 25:39.538
And you did it all on your own.

25:42.279 --> 25:45.065
I didn't do anything on my own.

25:46.675 --> 25:49.112
I leaned on my sponsor
and my family.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.418
My friends.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.855
It took a village,

25:52.899 --> 25:55.902
and even then,
I barely made it, you know?

25:56.946 --> 25:58.905
Nah...

25:58.948 --> 26:02.299
This thing was far too big
for me to face alone.

26:04.606 --> 26:09.002
Recognizing that fact
was half the battle.

26:10.264 --> 26:11.570
PATTON:
Bingo!

26:15.661 --> 26:17.445
What've you got?I think we hit the top

26:17.488 --> 26:19.099
of the food chain
with this call here.

26:19.142 --> 26:21.623
[computer chimes]Rick Vargas in Miami.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.582
We knew the top
of the network wasn't local,

26:23.625 --> 26:24.931
but they were able to shut
down the whole operation

26:24.974 --> 26:26.236
before we could track them.

26:26.280 --> 26:28.848
If Vargas is running
this operation out of Miami,

26:28.891 --> 26:31.024
he's got to have a lieutenant
with boots on the ground here.

26:31.067 --> 26:33.026
He does.
Guy named Darrel Wilson.

26:33.069 --> 26:34.636
He's a Miami native,
but he splits his time

26:34.680 --> 26:35.942
between New Orleans and Miami.

26:35.985 --> 26:37.117
He the one who called Vargas.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.379
Where's Wilson now?

26:38.422 --> 26:39.728
He's in New Orleans,
but he's on the move.

26:39.772 --> 26:40.947
Vargas's most
valuable assets

26:40.990 --> 26:42.165
are the women
he wants to traffic.

26:42.209 --> 26:43.645
He needs to get them
out of New Orleans.

26:43.689 --> 26:45.821
We need to get to them
before he does.

26:45.865 --> 26:47.388
You can track Wilson's phone,
real time?

26:47.431 --> 26:48.607
Hell yes, I can.

26:51.610 --> 26:55.526
PRIDE:
Following subject vehicle westbound on St. Claude Avenue.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.096
Darrel's just turned right.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.067
Massage parlor.
The women must be inside.

27:21.117 --> 27:22.510
But if he's gonna move them,

27:22.553 --> 27:24.294
he's gonna need
a bigger vehicle.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.166
This better not be
a wild goose chase.

27:27.515 --> 27:30.213
Bingo. He's got a van.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.173
He's definitely gonna move them.

27:33.216 --> 27:36.393
Not today, he's not.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.182
PRIDE:
That's a lot of firepower.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.578
You want to sit this one out?

27:49.624 --> 27:52.105
No. I'm good.

27:54.368 --> 27:57.632
PRIDE:
Hannah, Gregorio,

27:57.676 --> 27:59.721
you take the back.

27:59.765 --> 28:01.592
Isler and I have the front.

28:01.636 --> 28:04.030
Gear up.

28:09.426 --> 28:11.690
[quietly]:
Let's move.

28:30.534 --> 28:32.058
Federal agents!

28:32.101 --> 28:34.103
Nobody move!

28:35.148 --> 28:36.540
Put your weapons
on the ground.

28:36.584 --> 28:37.890
Slow.

28:37.933 --> 28:39.543
Nice and slow.

28:39.587 --> 28:40.719
Do it now!

28:54.254 --> 28:55.516
Federal agents. Stop.

28:55.559 --> 28:56.604
Go.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.262
[grunts]

29:02.305 --> 29:03.785
Where are the women? Hey.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.134
Where are the women?

29:05.178 --> 29:06.832
[strains]:
That way.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.268
I got him. Go.

29:12.359 --> 29:14.361
Where's Hannah?
Down.

29:20.193 --> 29:22.456
I owe ya.

29:25.285 --> 29:27.069
This way.

29:34.424 --> 29:36.296
[quietly]:
Cover me.

29:43.912 --> 29:45.305
[whimpering]

29:48.482 --> 29:50.136
It's okay.

29:50.179 --> 29:52.529
[crying]
It's okay.
Está bien.

30:05.673 --> 30:08.502
[siren whoops]

30:08.545 --> 30:10.504
Not bad for a day's work.

30:10.547 --> 30:11.810
Couldn't have done it
without you.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.594
Yeah. Well, we cracked
the Miami ring.

30:13.637 --> 30:15.596
Yeah, well, Miami's
only half the problem.

30:15.639 --> 30:17.728
They were working
fist in glove with Duvall.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.861
An operation this size, Duvall
doesn't have a few bad apples.

30:19.905 --> 30:22.864
That place is
rotten to the core.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.039
We need someone here
to flip on the guys

30:24.083 --> 30:25.649
running things
from the Duvall end.

30:25.693 --> 30:28.435
Pride and Hannah
are working on it as we speak.

30:28.478 --> 30:29.958
I got nothing to say to you.

30:30.002 --> 30:31.873
Well, that's okay.

30:31.917 --> 30:35.050
We just want you to listen.

30:35.094 --> 30:37.052
You run the massage parlor.

30:37.096 --> 30:40.882
You have for the past 15 years.

30:40.926 --> 30:42.884
You are a low-rent madam.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.800
Congratulations,
Captain Obvious.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.889
You've been busted a few times
for pandering.

30:47.933 --> 30:50.413
And you got me again. Big deal.

30:50.457 --> 30:52.415
I'll be out in six months.

30:52.459 --> 30:53.895
PRIDE:
That what you think?

30:53.939 --> 30:55.549
HANNAH:
She has no idea.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.812
Poor thing.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.292
What?

30:59.335 --> 31:01.555
You're not going
down for pandering.

31:01.598 --> 31:03.905
You're going down for
human trafficking.

31:03.949 --> 31:06.865
You may only have provided
a spot to hold these women

31:06.908 --> 31:09.650
on their way out of state, but
the way that conspiracy works,

31:09.693 --> 31:12.392
you are gonna go down
for all of it.

31:12.435 --> 31:15.743
We've already connected you
to Darrel Wilson.

31:15.786 --> 31:17.832
What are you talking about?The cash.

31:17.876 --> 31:20.008
He paid you.
We'll testify to that.

31:20.052 --> 31:23.011
And see, it connects you
to the conspiracy.

31:23.055 --> 31:24.926
In for a penny, in for a pound.

31:29.844 --> 31:32.586
What do you want to know?

31:37.983 --> 31:40.202
They're in there
destroying evidence.

31:40.246 --> 31:41.856
Pride wants this by the book.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.597
Okay? He wants a warrant.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.338
All we need is one
judge to sign off.

31:45.381 --> 31:46.687
It's valid once it's signed.

31:46.730 --> 31:48.819
Yeah, well,
they better hurry up.

31:48.863 --> 31:52.388
Yeah, still here.

31:52.432 --> 31:55.914
Yep. I-It's all
in the affidavit I sent.

31:57.698 --> 31:59.656
Is the judge looking at it?

31:59.700 --> 32:02.659
Hey, it's me. I need you to
pull Judge Halper off the bench,

32:02.703 --> 32:04.835
and you know I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

32:04.879 --> 32:07.142
No, it's okay, I'll wait.
I'll wait.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.275
Admit it, you miss this.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.712
[chuckles]
Oh! Yes.

32:11.755 --> 32:13.801
Thank you, thank you.
Hey, we're in.

32:14.933 --> 32:15.934
PRIDE:
We're good to go.

32:15.977 --> 32:17.761
We got a warrant.

32:17.805 --> 32:19.894
[machines buzzing]

32:19.938 --> 32:21.940
Federal agents!

32:21.983 --> 32:23.942
We have a warrant!You are all under arrest.

32:23.985 --> 32:25.900
Step away
from the shredders now!

32:25.944 --> 32:27.206
Put your hands up!

32:31.210 --> 32:32.515
Put your hands up,
step away from the computer.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.518
You?

32:35.562 --> 32:36.911
Told you I'd be in touch.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.478
This is all just
a big misunderstanding.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.871
You might want
to remain silent for this part.

32:43.439 --> 32:45.746
I want to talk to an attorney.Or not.

32:45.789 --> 32:48.618
Look whose hands
are tied now, Trevor.

32:50.229 --> 32:52.796
Get him out of my sight.

32:57.018 --> 32:59.151
Zeke, you sure this
is the right place?

33:05.026 --> 33:07.159
Hang on. I think I found it.

33:09.030 --> 33:10.989
Told you I left it out here.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.212
It is Cade's. It's his wallet.

33:18.735 --> 33:20.694
I'm sorry.

33:23.914 --> 33:26.613
What else happened out here?

33:26.656 --> 33:28.832
I mean, you must've
seen something.

33:28.876 --> 33:30.530
I-I didn't.

33:30.573 --> 33:31.922
Look, this is my brother Cade.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.054
The one I was telling you about.

33:33.098 --> 33:35.056
Who was with
him that night?

33:35.100 --> 33:36.971
Huh? What happened out here?

33:37.015 --> 33:39.756
Zeke, speak up, man.
What do you know?

33:39.800 --> 33:40.844
Come on, talk to me.Hey, hey, hey.

33:40.888 --> 33:42.020
Was you in on it?

33:42.063 --> 33:43.717
Huh?Hey, Chris.
Chris, Chris.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.198
[stammers] He's told us
everything he knows.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.895
Damn it!

33:49.114 --> 33:51.333
We should've stuck
with Will's lead.

33:51.377 --> 33:53.205
Shorty's gonna help us
find Cade. Come on, Sebastian.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.076
Let's go back
to the basketball court.

33:55.120 --> 33:56.860
Yeah, we-we're gonna find Shorty
and we're gonna talk to him,

33:56.904 --> 33:58.862
but right now, Chris,

33:58.906 --> 34:01.169
we got to stay out here
a little longer, yeah?

34:13.921 --> 34:16.358
Call in the dogs.

34:18.665 --> 34:19.927
[speaks indistinctly]

34:29.632 --> 34:31.939
[indistinct chatter]

34:44.343 --> 34:47.128
Come on, let's go. Move it.

34:47.172 --> 34:48.608
There.

34:55.354 --> 34:59.053
These detainees.
Where will they go from here?

34:59.097 --> 35:01.621
They'll be split up between
three different facilities.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.753
Private ones?

35:03.797 --> 35:05.494
Overcrowded?

35:07.931 --> 35:09.281
[exhales]

35:09.324 --> 35:11.109
They have to be detained.

35:11.152 --> 35:13.198
This is the best I can do.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.678
It's just not good enough.

35:16.723 --> 35:19.639
Thanks, guys.

35:19.682 --> 35:21.684
[phone ringing]

35:24.774 --> 35:26.776
What do you got, Sebastian?

35:29.344 --> 35:31.303
W-What do you mean?

35:31.346 --> 35:33.566
Chris can't ID the body?

35:35.655 --> 35:38.658
Burned beyond recognition.

35:38.701 --> 35:41.356
[exhales]

35:41.400 --> 35:43.402
How's he holding up?

35:46.318 --> 35:49.147
Just call me as soon
as you get back.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.721
I don't know
how to thank you guys.Us?

35:58.765 --> 36:00.549
You were the dog with a bone.

36:00.593 --> 36:01.724
[laughs softly]

36:01.768 --> 36:02.769
Your bravery saved
all those women

36:02.812 --> 36:04.466
from being trafficked.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.599
Well, it wouldn't have mattered
if you hadn't listened.

36:06.642 --> 36:08.992
Hmm. That's true.

36:09.036 --> 36:10.646
I hope you can stand
some more good news,

36:10.690 --> 36:12.953
because we contacted
the ACLU,

36:12.996 --> 36:15.999
and they're gonna
take your dad's case.

36:16.043 --> 36:18.263
What?And, no promises,

36:18.306 --> 36:19.742
but the attorney thinks

36:19.786 --> 36:22.005
that with your dad's strong ties
to the community,

36:22.049 --> 36:24.617
he's gonna be able
to stay in the U.S.

36:24.660 --> 36:26.009
while he waits
for his asylum hearing.

36:26.053 --> 36:27.750
[exhales]

36:27.794 --> 36:29.578
Oh, my God. Thank you.

36:29.622 --> 36:30.666
Of course.

36:30.710 --> 36:32.015
[sniffles]

36:32.059 --> 36:34.670
Thank you so much.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.679
So,

36:43.723 --> 36:46.247
got to admit, good being
back in the field, huh?

36:46.291 --> 36:48.249
It felt familiar.
Oh, stop.

36:48.293 --> 36:50.817
You loved it.
I liked it.

36:50.860 --> 36:52.819
All right. I'll take like.

36:52.862 --> 36:55.213
Did you like it enough to get
back with the FBI or what?

36:55.256 --> 36:57.040
Eh, I'm done with D.C.

36:57.084 --> 36:58.694
Fair enough.

36:58.738 --> 37:01.784
But I'm not going anywhere
for the time being.

37:01.828 --> 37:04.396
Oh?
At least not till
I catch a fish.

37:04.439 --> 37:06.833
Huh.

37:06.876 --> 37:09.139
This city really got
under your skin, huh?

37:09.183 --> 37:10.750
[chuckles]

37:12.752 --> 37:15.015
Guess so.

37:17.452 --> 37:19.715
So, Loretta gettin' Cade's
dental records?

37:19.759 --> 37:20.760
How soon?

37:22.849 --> 37:25.199
All right, I-I'm--
I'm heading over right now.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.379
Hey, you got a minute?

37:31.423 --> 37:33.816
Uh, no, no. Not really.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.340
Come on, it won't take long.

37:35.383 --> 37:38.212
Look, Jimmy, I-I think I
know what this is about.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.735
You've been worried about me.

37:39.779 --> 37:40.910
[chuckles]
It's that obvious?

37:40.954 --> 37:42.521
Yeah. Well, but I appreciate

37:42.564 --> 37:44.740
your concern,
I do, but I'm fine.

37:44.784 --> 37:45.828
I know you are. You always are.

37:45.872 --> 37:48.178
I just want you to know

37:48.222 --> 37:49.832
if you're ever not fine,
you talk to me.

37:49.876 --> 37:51.660
Thanks.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.793
And... I will.

37:53.836 --> 37:55.534
All right. Now go.

37:55.577 --> 37:58.363
I see you got someplace
you need to be.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.504
Hey.

38:11.985 --> 38:13.291
Hey.

38:15.902 --> 38:17.686
You want to take a walk?

38:17.730 --> 38:19.297
Loretta will

38:19.340 --> 38:21.908
text me the minute
they know anything.

38:24.171 --> 38:27.130
When I was a kid,

38:27.174 --> 38:30.743
my dad had
this riding lawn mower.

38:30.786 --> 38:32.527
Cade and I,

38:32.571 --> 38:36.792
we weren't allowed
anywhere around it.

38:36.836 --> 38:40.796
I was probably about
seven years old.

38:40.840 --> 38:43.190
Cade was around nine.

38:45.845 --> 38:48.804
One day,
I got my hands on the keys.

38:48.848 --> 38:51.154
Cade, he knew what I was up to.

38:53.418 --> 38:56.159
He tried to stop me,
but somehow,

38:56.203 --> 38:58.858
I convinced him to come with me.

38:58.901 --> 39:02.078
We were riding
around and around,

39:02.122 --> 39:06.605
having ourselves
a good old time.

39:06.648 --> 39:09.259
Till I hit this rock.

39:09.303 --> 39:12.262
Flipped the whole thing over.

39:12.306 --> 39:16.789
Busted the front tire,
broke the lawn mower blades.

39:16.832 --> 39:19.052
Daddy found out.
He said, "Boys...

39:20.358 --> 39:23.273
...whose idea was this?"

39:25.537 --> 39:29.062
Before I could say anything...
[clears throat]

39:29.105 --> 39:33.893
...Cade stepped up,
said it was his.

39:37.070 --> 39:40.813
Nine years old,

39:40.856 --> 39:43.598
he took the blame for me.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.905
Took the whupping, too.

39:49.909 --> 39:51.911
I didn't know what to say.

39:53.782 --> 39:59.440
He was walking by,
and I asked him, I said, "Why?

39:59.484 --> 40:02.312
Why'd you do that?"

40:05.577 --> 40:08.884
He said, "I'm your brother.

40:08.928 --> 40:11.496
That's what big brothers do."

40:17.284 --> 40:19.634
I was just thinking
a lot about then.

40:19.678 --> 40:20.940
[sniffles]

40:23.116 --> 40:26.946
Before... everything.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.778
Cade was a good brother.

40:36.956 --> 40:38.871
You are, too.

40:38.914 --> 40:40.525
[door opens]

40:48.358 --> 40:51.100
I'm so sorry, Christopher.
