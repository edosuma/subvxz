It's a quarantine.

00:10.138 --> 00:11.605
Dad, who cares?

00:11.673 --> 00:13.540
We're all gonna be dead
soon enough anyway.

00:13.608 --> 00:15.509
No one under 22
years old has died.

payment after the family receives

possession of the baby.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.155
I said, get in the cell.

00:30.124 --> 00:31.224
It's a boy.

[baby crying] And it's
alive and kicking.

- Do you have any chicken?
- Fish is all we have.

01:50.570 --> 01:52.488
When you getting more?

01:52.572 --> 01:54.282
I don't know, maybe when
the fence comes down.

01:55.157 --> 01:57.493
Thanks.
For nothing.

01:58.744 --> 02:01.622
[man] Hey, no, no pushing, come on.
You want it, get in line.

02:01.706 --> 02:03.791
[Kevin] Hi, Sarah.
Hey, Jeremy.

02:03.874 --> 02:05.125
Two hamburgers.

02:05.209 --> 02:06.586
Who's looking after you?

02:06.669 --> 02:08.002
Girl at the church.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.339
Melissa?

02:09.422 --> 02:12.592
But we heard some big kids
talking about free hamburgers.

02:12.675 --> 02:15.010
I'm sorry, but we ran out
a couple hours ago.

02:15.094 --> 02:16.303
You want something else?

02:16.387 --> 02:20.475
No, I told my sister there
wouldn't be any hamburgers.

02:20.558 --> 02:22.226
It was just kids lying to us.

02:22.310 --> 02:24.395
But there was.
You're just a bit too late.

02:24.479 --> 02:26.063
Yeah, sure.

02:31.861 --> 02:33.446
[Kevin] Next.
[girl] Can I have a drink, please?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.991
- Here.
- Thanks.

02:44.707 --> 02:46.250
Get out of the way.
What happened?

02:47.710 --> 02:51.213
I pushed on the brakes,
but the car just wouldn't stop.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.882
I don't understand.

02:52.965 --> 02:55.926
The car's supposed to stop,
not go faster.

03:03.726 --> 03:04.727

Hey.

[sighs]

03:46.644 --> 03:48.521
Planning on going outside today?

03:49.814 --> 03:51.231
Not sure.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.068
I could use some help with the kids.

03:55.402 --> 03:58.238
I warned you not to start
an orphanage, Mother Teresa.

03:58.322 --> 04:01.116
Come on, Wiley. It's been, like,
four days, you've barely moved.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.201
You won't eat.

04:02.284 --> 04:05.663
Okay, I get it, the world sucks right now,
but you can't just check out.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.122
You could at least name your son.

04:07.206 --> 04:09.667
[scoffs] You do it.
I don't care!

04:11.461 --> 04:13.337
You were raised better than this.

04:14.088 --> 04:15.965
No, I wasn't!

04:16.048 --> 04:18.175
And isn't it a comfort that
Mom and Dad aren't around to see

04:18.257 --> 04:20.135
what a disappointment
their daughter turned out to be?

04:22.472 --> 04:23.598
Yeah.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.725
Yeah, it is.

04:30.145 --> 04:33.357
[sighs]

04:36.694 --> 04:38.028
Have you seen Lana?

04:38.112 --> 04:42.867
I tried calling her on her cellular phone,
but I just got her voice mail.

04:42.950 --> 04:47.121
So I said,
"Hi. It's me, Amanda.

04:47.204 --> 04:50.082
Your sister. I miss you."

04:50.165 --> 04:52.793
Do you think that she got that message?

04:53.919 --> 04:58.466
I don't know.
Nobody's seen her since Sunday.

04:58.549 --> 05:01.552
She's been gone for four days.

05:01.636 --> 05:04.221
That's a lot of days!

05:04.304 --> 05:08.142
Especially if she doesn't have underwear!

05:08.225 --> 05:10.060
Does she have underwear?

05:10.144 --> 05:13.147
Amanda, stop!
I don't know where she is, okay?

05:13.230 --> 05:15.608
And I don't know if she has underwear.

05:15.691 --> 05:19.904
It's important to have underwear.
Mom always said that to me.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.073
Amanda, let it go.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.366
[sighing]

05:25.409 --> 05:26.911
Letting it go.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.741
Sarah, where's your brother, Jeremy?

06:05.825 --> 06:06.951
He died.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.329
From the virus?

06:10.412 --> 06:12.331
No, he got runned over.

06:14.959 --> 06:16.543

[Ms. Symonds] Could everyone listen up?

06:54.957 --> 06:57.960
Please, this will go faster
if everyone will just be quiet.

06:58.043 --> 06:59.879
Everybody, be quiet!

07:01.631 --> 07:03.758
- [yelling] Shut up!
- [clamoring stops]

07:03.841 --> 07:04.967
Thank you, Felix.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.679
We've just been sent this message.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.432
Citizens of Pretty Lake,

07:12.516 --> 07:18.731
right now we have confirmed reports
that no one over 22 is left alive.

07:18.814 --> 07:25.112
We do not think that anyone still living
in Pretty Lake has anything to fear.

07:25.195 --> 07:28.741
In the meantime, the most
important thing that needs to be done

07:28.824 --> 07:31.744
is to gather all of the bodies
and burn them.

07:31.827 --> 07:35.247
Full instructions will be posted
on the town's website.

07:35.330 --> 07:39.835
I understand this is an awful and
dreadful thing we ask you to do,

07:39.919 --> 07:42.004
but once the bodies have been burned,

07:42.087 --> 07:45.966
we hope that we will be able
to lift the quarantine.

07:47.301 --> 07:52.097
The world is praying with you
through your unimaginable loss.

07:52.181 --> 07:54.599
We have witnessed
your heart-wrenching photos,

07:54.684 --> 07:57.436
and heard your cries for help.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.773
Know that we as a nation
are doing everything in our power

08:00.856 --> 08:03.525
to bring your plight to an end.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.486
Thank you for your cooperation.

08:08.823 --> 08:11.241
[crowd murmuring]

08:12.076 --> 08:15.287
I guess we're starting a bonfire.

08:15.370 --> 08:18.082
Wonder if we have
any marshmallows left.

[girl 1] I want the balloon!

08:38.977 --> 08:41.270
[girl 2] Hey! That's my teddy bear!

08:41.355 --> 08:42.898
[boy 2] Yay, sandwiches!

Sandwiches!

10:11.904 --> 10:13.823
I love you, Mom.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.829
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.805
[Mark shouting] Hello!

10:40.140 --> 10:41.766
Hello!

10:44.311 --> 10:46.563
Is anyone out there?

10:48.773 --> 10:51.110
Is anyone out there?

10:52.736 --> 10:54.279
Please!

11:10.129 --> 11:11.171
You sure about this?

11:11.255 --> 11:15.342
Yep. The kids at the church need food.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.426
[grunts]

11:27.855 --> 11:29.398
[Kevin] Chuck,

11:29.481 --> 11:33.235
at this rate we'll be lucky if they
lift the quarantine by Christmas.

11:35.487 --> 11:36.738
Listen up!

11:36.821 --> 11:41.160
We get everybody over the age of 12
helping with these bodies.

11:41.243 --> 11:42.577
Let's go!

11:46.373 --> 11:48.417
I like it when you're in charge.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.172
[Amanda] Lana?

11:55.174 --> 11:57.134
Lana?

11:58.677 --> 11:59.970
Lana?

12:01.388 --> 12:04.308
- Anyone find Lana yet?
- No, not that I've heard.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.310
Maybe she got out
before the fence went up.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.770
- Yeah, maybe.
- All right.

12:16.486 --> 12:17.571
[inaudible]

12:30.500 --> 12:31.961
Help me grab some of this stuff, Franny?

12:32.044 --> 12:33.253
Yeah.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.474
What's Ronnie doing coming
out of the Marshalls' place?

12:45.557 --> 12:48.143
- Let's forget about Ronnie.
- No, we're gonna deal with this right now.

12:48.227 --> 12:49.644
- Gord, no!
- Ronnie!

12:49.728 --> 12:51.313
Ronnie!

12:51.396 --> 12:52.647
Hey!

12:55.650 --> 12:57.402
Any reason for you to be
in the Marshalls' place?

12:57.486 --> 12:58.528
They're dead, okay?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.322
The government's just gonna
take their stuff away anyways.

13:00.405 --> 13:02.116
So I'm just getting a head start.
No one loses.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.368
It doesn't work that way, Ronnie,
and you know that.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.203
These people have family.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.455
Relatives with a rightful
claim to that stuff.

13:08.538 --> 13:10.832
- You can't just take it.
- Don't touch it!

13:14.044 --> 13:16.630
Looks like you made a little trip
to the pharmacy too, huh?

13:16.713 --> 13:20.217
Come on, Ronnie,
people might need those drugs.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.926
I don't think so.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.221
Back up.

13:24.304 --> 13:25.930
Take it easy, Ronnie.
Use your head.

13:26.015 --> 13:27.766
Just back off, Gord.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.602
- Let him go, Gord. This isn't worth it!
- It's okay.

13:32.187 --> 13:34.106
Hey, what the hell's going on here?

13:34.189 --> 13:37.484
Ronnie here thinks
he can steal from people.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.819
Apparently, he's not
the only one who thinks that.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.821
All of you, just back up.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.034
- Back up!
- [Felix] Don't shoot.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.661
Hey, hey, just take the stuff
and get out of here.

13:47.744 --> 13:50.622
Are you serious?
He stole from people, from the pharmacy.

13:50.705 --> 13:53.125
Yeah, well, I don't wanna get
shot by this idiot, Gord.

13:53.208 --> 13:56.253
Hey! Just so you know,
I didn't do anything wrong.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.713
I only took stuff from dead people,
they don't need it.

13:58.797 --> 14:02.801
Yeah, and then you threatened
to shoot me when I tried to stop you.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.721
I still might.

14:10.392 --> 14:11.726
Pack the bag.

14:11.810 --> 14:13.270
Okay. Okay.

14:21.736 --> 14:22.946
Go!

14:30.370 --> 14:32.414
You and I need to talk.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.919
[sighs deeply]

14:45.427 --> 14:46.553
[door opens]

14:50.014 --> 14:51.057
You scared me.

14:51.141 --> 14:54.478
Sorry. I haven't heard
from you in a few hours.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.563
Didn't you get my texts?

14:56.646 --> 15:01.025
No, I've been too busy looking into
the deaths, trying to find something.

15:01.110 --> 15:02.569
Shouldn't you be helping with the bodies?

15:02.652 --> 15:05.114
And the sooner it's done,
the sooner the fence can come down.

15:05.197 --> 15:08.075
Ms. Symonds, what if the fence
isn't coming down?

15:08.158 --> 15:11.035
When I tried to escape,
they wanted to kill me.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.081
Not stop me.
Kill me.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.749
So what are you saying?

15:15.832 --> 15:17.376
If the government
thought this thing was over,

15:17.459 --> 15:20.879
why wouldn't they send in guys
with hazmat suits to give us a hand?

15:20.962 --> 15:22.464
Last time I checked,
no one around here

15:22.547 --> 15:25.300
has the skill set to deal
with mass cremation.

15:28.303 --> 15:31.973
- [Ms. Symonds] So what's your plan?
- I don't have one.

15:32.056 --> 15:33.808
I've been up half the night
surfing chat rooms,

15:33.892 --> 15:36.395
trying to see if anyone knows anything.

15:36.478 --> 15:38.980
Why hasn't it killed anyone under 22?

15:40.649 --> 15:44.694
If I had to guess...
'cause we're younger, healthier?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.238
But precisely 22?

15:48.323 --> 15:49.824
My uncle was the area's medical officer.

15:49.908 --> 15:53.745
I thought there might be records
on his computer that point to a solution.

15:53.828 --> 15:55.580
And?

15:55.664 --> 15:58.542
I haven't found anything worth mentioning.

15:58.625 --> 16:01.670
Except that he had a hidden life
as a cross-dresser.

16:01.753 --> 16:02.796
Seriously?

16:02.879 --> 16:05.715
No. But I did check.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.050
[laughs softly]

16:10.220 --> 16:11.346
[Gord sighs]

16:12.431 --> 16:16.185
Honestly, I didn't even know that
your family owned the grocery store, too.

16:16.268 --> 16:18.145
I figured it belonged to
a chain or something.

16:18.228 --> 16:21.898
Look, Gord, I'm gonna
let it go this time, but next time...

16:21.981 --> 16:25.819
Next time what?
It was a mistake, I apologized.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.905
Doesn't change the fact that there
were kids that needed food and supplies.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.282
Were you ever gonna open it up?

16:30.365 --> 16:32.409
Just make sure you clear it with me first.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.493
Hey.

16:34.953 --> 16:36.371
[Gord sighs]

16:36.455 --> 16:39.708
I'm not gonna stand here
and watch this town fall apart.

16:39.791 --> 16:40.875
Once we burn the bodies,

16:40.959 --> 16:42.502
if no one else dies,
they will lift the quarantine.

16:42.586 --> 16:43.712
We just have to...

16:43.795 --> 16:47.966
We just have to keep things from
going to pieces a little bit longer.

16:48.049 --> 16:49.176
If Ronnie screws up again,

16:49.259 --> 16:51.678
I'm gonna get some of the boys over there
and talk to the Creekers.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.972
No offense, but things
will get ugly real quick

16:54.055 --> 16:55.932
if they see half
the hockey team out there.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.393
Let me talk to his brother, Pat.

16:58.477 --> 17:00.854
He's not a bad guy.
He'll keep Ronnie in line.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.190
[sighs]

17:04.107 --> 17:05.233
Gord.

17:07.611 --> 17:09.488
Now I never did understand...

17:10.821 --> 17:12.656
why'd you quit the Dukes?

17:14.951 --> 17:19.539
My dad didn't give me a choice.
He never was one for sports.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.626
Besides, I was needed on the farm.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.044
You were the best winger I ever saw.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.633
Glory days.

17:31.426 --> 17:34.929
[panting] Chuck!
You have to see this.

17:35.013 --> 17:38.099
We went to Andrea's house
to look for Lana and saw it.

17:39.226 --> 17:41.102
Why would anyone do this?

17:41.185 --> 17:43.397
My guess, it's easier
to get the ring off.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.564
Who do you think it was?

17:44.648 --> 17:47.651
Think? No, I know who it was.
It was Ronnie. Come on, let's go.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.871
- You have to let me out.
- [Ellen] I'm leaving.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.706
There's enough food here
to last you a few weeks.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.250
The authorities know where you are.

18:03.333 --> 18:05.627
What you're doing is wrong.

18:06.420 --> 18:09.256
I was told under no circumstances
to let you out.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.216
Then my death will be on your hands.

18:12.301 --> 18:14.010
[scoffs] You're a murderer.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.265
I only killed my father because I had to.

18:19.391 --> 18:22.101
Because if I didn't,
he would've killed my mom.

18:22.185 --> 18:25.272
[chuckles softly]
Where have I heard that one before?

18:25.355 --> 18:26.731
- [slams bars]
- Check my records!

18:27.899 --> 18:30.652
I don't think you're in
any position to be yelling at me.

18:32.612 --> 18:35.532
Just check them! Please!

18:40.078 --> 18:42.872
- [cartoons playing on TV]
- [Franny] You're gonna guess, okay?

18:45.208 --> 18:49.128
I want you to play this one.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.631
So we'll just put
that one over here, okay?

18:51.715 --> 18:54.092
[Melissa]
Your sister is a natural with kids.

18:54.718 --> 18:58.513
Seems like you may have some skills
in that department yourself.

19:03.560 --> 19:04.728
Are you okay?

19:06.104 --> 19:08.482
Hey, it's all right.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.691
[crying] No.

19:11.275 --> 19:14.112
No, it's not because
Jeremy wouldn't be dead

19:14.195 --> 19:16.365
if I had just been paying attention.

19:16.448 --> 19:19.576
Hey, Mel,
it's not your fault.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.453
There are too many kids.

19:21.536 --> 19:23.580
We should've gotten you help sooner.

19:28.918 --> 19:30.169
It's gonna be all right.

19:31.588 --> 19:34.007
Do you really think so?
[sniffles]

19:35.800 --> 19:36.885
Yeah.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.638
Yeah, I have to.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.777
[computer beeping]

19:57.864 --> 19:59.491
[computer chimes]

20:18.176 --> 20:19.177
Whoa.

20:20.303 --> 20:21.680
Hello, Art Carey.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.183
[Wiley] Are you talking
to your computer again?

20:26.309 --> 20:29.145
Most of my conversations these days
are one way.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.565
You haven't answered my texts in days.

20:33.232 --> 20:34.275
Sorry.

20:34.358 --> 20:38.154
So who's "Art Carey"?

20:38.237 --> 20:41.450
I don't know.
But I'm gonna find out.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.868
He's got a Level 5
government clearance.

20:43.952 --> 20:46.162
Had no ties to Pretty Lake
until three months ago.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.790
Doesn't sound like much of a lead.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.291
No, probably not.

20:50.374 --> 20:53.920
But he's the only person I've found that
might have a clue as to what's going on.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.379
Well, you know...

20:57.006 --> 20:59.551
if he does know something,
he would've left.

21:00.594 --> 21:04.388
And if he didn't,
he'd be dead, right?

21:07.308 --> 21:08.309
[sighs]

21:09.811 --> 21:11.938
- Everyone's dead.
- [typing]

21:12.021 --> 21:13.565
I've got his address here.

21:13.648 --> 21:16.400
I'll go to his place tomorrow
and see what I can find.

21:22.073 --> 21:24.075
Are you okay?

21:31.332 --> 21:34.418
Do you know why your dad left?

21:36.755 --> 21:38.548
No.

21:42.176 --> 21:45.889
[voice breaking] If he had a good reason,
would that make it any better?

21:53.104 --> 21:55.482
Will you lie with me?

21:56.900 --> 21:58.192
Please?

22:29.648 --> 22:31.692
[indistinct radio chatter]

22:55.549 --> 22:56.843
[exhales]

23:19.448 --> 23:21.200
Get away from there.

23:23.577 --> 23:26.205
Please, I'm just looking
for something that's mine.

23:26.289 --> 23:30.376
Yours? This is my dad's office.
Nothing of yours is in here.

23:30.459 --> 23:34.338
Okay. Then I'm just gonna go, okay?

23:37.508 --> 23:39.510
No, please.

23:39.593 --> 23:41.595
[sighs] Don't go.

23:42.430 --> 23:43.514
Then put the knife down.

23:44.723 --> 23:46.267
You won't hurt me?

23:48.186 --> 23:49.895
No, I won't hurt you.

23:56.152 --> 23:57.278
[inhales sharply]

23:57.987 --> 23:59.447
You okay?

24:04.618 --> 24:05.911
[Tracey sighs]

24:08.706 --> 24:10.041
What are you doing?

24:12.043 --> 24:14.837
Grandma's clothes aren't
any good to us anymore.

24:14.920 --> 24:17.548
Probably just bring them to a clothing bin
or something downtown.

24:18.174 --> 24:20.134
Who do you think's
gonna pick them up?

24:34.398 --> 24:35.941
Damn it, it's Chuck.

24:37.526 --> 24:40.029
You'll stay here
if you know what's good for you.

24:41.239 --> 24:43.616
Pat? We have company!

24:43.699 --> 24:45.994
Yeah. Sure.

24:47.036 --> 24:49.663
[Chuck] We just want a word with Ronnie.

24:49.747 --> 24:50.789
[Pat] Listen, Chuck,
if I were you,

24:50.873 --> 24:53.042
I'd get back in that car
before something happens

24:53.126 --> 24:54.460
that both of us regret.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.213
Your brother's a psychopath, Pat.

24:57.296 --> 25:00.424
He cut off Mrs. Marshall's finger
just to get a ring.

25:00.508 --> 25:01.717
And you saw him do this?

25:01.800 --> 25:04.678
Well, we have witnesses,
says he went inside the house.

25:04.762 --> 25:06.347
That's right.

25:06.430 --> 25:08.266
That still doesn't prove he did anything.

25:08.349 --> 25:11.852
Oh, come on, Pat.
You and I both know he did it.

25:11.935 --> 25:14.272
You know what,
your brother is one sick...

25:14.355 --> 25:16.065
[Kevin] Hey!

25:16.149 --> 25:17.400
[Tracey] Stay back!

25:18.526 --> 25:20.111
[Pat] Who do you think you are,
coming here like this?

25:20.194 --> 25:22.613
You'd walk over your own
dead mother's body to get ahead.

25:22.696 --> 25:24.823
So don't you talk to me
about my brother.

25:27.368 --> 25:29.870
You never worked for
a damn thing in your life.

25:29.953 --> 25:32.290
Your family may own half of Pretty Lake,

25:32.373 --> 25:34.250
you don't own this piece of it.

25:34.333 --> 25:37.670
So stop taking the law into your own hands
and get the hell out of here.

25:41.465 --> 25:44.260
Unless, of course,
you wanna pay the price.

25:49.057 --> 25:52.393
I'm not the law.
I never pretended to be.

25:52.476 --> 25:54.978
But it's not right what he did
and you know it.

25:55.063 --> 25:56.772
You wouldn't know the difference
between right and wrong

25:56.855 --> 25:58.482
if it sat on your rich face.

25:59.525 --> 26:01.902
Well, beats being a redneck.

26:08.492 --> 26:09.660
Let's go.

26:19.170 --> 26:20.379
You gonna let him get away with that?

26:21.089 --> 26:23.216
Did you cut off her finger
and steal that ring?

26:24.049 --> 26:25.426
What do you think?

26:31.140 --> 26:32.641
[Wiley sighs]

26:32.725 --> 26:35.269
What are you looking for?

26:35.353 --> 26:37.313
The combination for the safe.

26:38.021 --> 26:39.857
You're never gonna find it.

26:40.899 --> 26:43.819
- You know the combination?
- Maybe.

26:43.902 --> 26:45.529
[sighs]

26:45.613 --> 26:47.448
Come on, Nate,
I'm not feeling so great.

26:47.531 --> 26:50.118
If you know the combination,
just give it to me.

26:50.201 --> 26:51.410
Why should I?

26:52.661 --> 26:54.663
Your father and I made a deal.

26:54.747 --> 26:57.541
He died before
he could keep his end of it.

26:57.625 --> 26:59.460
There's an envelope
with my name on it in the safe.

26:59.543 --> 27:01.170
That's all I want.

27:07.092 --> 27:08.886
[safe beeping]

27:09.428 --> 27:10.763
[Wiley groans softly]

27:13.432 --> 27:15.184
You were right. There...

27:18.979 --> 27:20.273
Oh, no.

27:26.779 --> 27:31.074
If you guys are collecting bodies,
I could use some help.

27:56.658 --> 27:57.868
The quarantine's almost over.

27:57.951 --> 28:00.913
At least that's what
everybody's saying on Facebook.

28:00.996 --> 28:02.455
And the kids that have
actually been to the fence

28:02.539 --> 28:04.332
say there's less soldiers guarding it.

28:05.250 --> 28:07.085
- [Amanda screaming]
- [knife clatters]

28:07.169 --> 28:09.587
- [whimpering]
- What... What happened?

28:10.630 --> 28:13.216
I was making a burger and fries.

28:14.301 --> 28:16.178
Okay. Amanda...

28:17.637 --> 28:20.640
you can't cook anything, okay?
I told you that already.

28:20.723 --> 28:26.479
I thought if I made fries and a burger,
Lana would come home.

28:26.563 --> 28:28.315
They are her favorite!

28:31.985 --> 28:34.988
Look, it doesn't work like that, okay?

28:35.072 --> 28:37.490
Lana's not coming home
because she's hungry.

28:37.574 --> 28:38.867
She might.

28:52.047 --> 28:53.298
[Gord] Hello?

29:02.057 --> 29:03.851
Hello, you okay?

29:22.577 --> 29:24.121
Lana...

29:29.960 --> 29:31.544
[keys jingling faintly]

29:33.713 --> 29:35.340
[footsteps approaching]

29:35.423 --> 29:37.050
[lock opening]

29:42.639 --> 29:43.640
It's your lucky day.

29:44.474 --> 29:45.683
First one in a long time.

29:45.767 --> 29:49.354
[inhales] I had a change of heart.
I looked at your file.

29:51.064 --> 29:52.065
Thanks.

29:53.984 --> 29:56.153
Maybe I had you pegged wrong all along.

29:57.445 --> 29:58.696
Maybe you're not so bad.

29:58.780 --> 29:59.948
[Ellen groans]

30:02.242 --> 30:03.243
[cocks gun]

30:09.124 --> 30:11.459
One good turn deserves another.

30:19.092 --> 30:21.678
[Adam] Guys, I really don't think
I'm gonna be able to help you.

30:21.761 --> 30:24.681
- I don't even watch CSI.
- You're the smartest guy we know.

30:28.143 --> 30:29.811
[Chuck shuddering]

30:37.819 --> 30:38.987
[sobs]

30:45.785 --> 30:49.289
- You just found her like this?
- Yeah. I didn't move her.

30:52.625 --> 30:55.628
[flinching]
Adam, take a look.

31:02.219 --> 31:03.595
[sighs]

31:03.678 --> 31:06.556
Okay. I don't know.

31:07.515 --> 31:10.893
You know as well as I do
that it looks like she shot herself.

31:10.978 --> 31:13.146
But why? Why?

31:16.774 --> 31:17.900
- [Adam] Wait.
- What?

31:17.985 --> 31:19.236
That could be evidence.

31:20.903 --> 31:23.406
Right, right. Sorry.

31:23.490 --> 31:24.866
[Gord grunts]

31:25.993 --> 31:28.495
Whoa. Hey, look at this.

31:29.871 --> 31:32.624
The footprints.
There should just be hers, right?

31:32.707 --> 31:35.585
Well, maybe someone
found her before we did.

31:35.668 --> 31:38.630
Look at them though,
they've torn up the ground a bit.

31:38.713 --> 31:40.715
Like there was a struggle.

31:40.798 --> 31:42.884
You think someone did this to her?

31:42.968 --> 31:46.429
I don't know.
Some things don't add up.

31:46.513 --> 31:49.266
Maybe I don't have any idea
what I'm talking about.

31:51.643 --> 31:54.021
I don't wanna leave her here
until the quarantine's lifted.

31:54.104 --> 31:56.273
But if it's a crime scene,
we can't just move her.

31:58.775 --> 31:59.985
[camera clicking]

32:00.068 --> 32:01.361
What are you doing?

32:01.444 --> 32:03.821
This might help investigators
when the time comes.

32:04.990 --> 32:07.117
And we'll hold on to the gun.

32:12.289 --> 32:13.290
All right.

32:13.373 --> 32:14.791
Chuck, you don't have to do that yourself.

32:14.874 --> 32:16.876
No, I got it.
[shuddering]

32:16.959 --> 32:18.461
[grunting]

32:30.598 --> 32:34.352
[Ronnie] I'm glad we're doing this here.
This is where they belong.

32:44.904 --> 32:47.282
[Pat] People are saying
terrorists might be behind this.

32:47.365 --> 32:48.741
[Tracey] I heard that, too.

32:48.825 --> 32:50.452
But why just us?

32:50.535 --> 32:53.205
Wouldn't they take out
all of North America?

32:53.288 --> 32:55.832
[Ronnie] Who knows?
Maybe they will.

33:06.593 --> 33:08.511
[sighs]

33:14.892 --> 33:16.228
[door closing]

33:18.855 --> 33:20.648
Hi, Chuck.
You wanna make spaghetti?

33:21.483 --> 33:24.361
Um... can you sit down for a second?

33:25.612 --> 33:26.654
No.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.073
Why?

33:28.156 --> 33:32.327
Because every time I sit down,
someone dies.

33:34.496 --> 33:35.663
[sighs]

33:37.290 --> 33:38.875
Where's Lana?

33:44.214 --> 33:45.882
Can you sit down?

33:47.134 --> 33:48.426
No!

33:48.510 --> 33:49.844
Amanda...

34:17.621 --> 34:19.416
[cell phone vibrating]

34:22.168 --> 34:23.753
- Hello?
- [Judy] Franny?

34:23.835 --> 34:25.380
Aunt Judy!

34:25.463 --> 34:26.839
How are you?

34:26.922 --> 34:29.342
It's so hard to get calls
into Pretty Lake.

34:29.426 --> 34:31.386
Are you okay?

34:31.469 --> 34:33.263
Yeah, you know...

34:33.346 --> 34:36.974
Oh, Frances, it won't always be
this awful, I promise.

34:37.058 --> 34:40.687
We're all in such shock.
I can't imagine how you're feeling.

34:40.770 --> 34:42.938
Once the quarantine...
Just know that...

34:43.022 --> 34:45.358
- Wait. No. Wait!
- Can to help. We're praying for...

34:45.442 --> 34:47.109
[line disconnects]

34:55.952 --> 34:57.162
[sighs]

35:52.091 --> 35:53.510
[indistinct chatter]

36:07.274 --> 36:09.942
[Gord] Okay, buddy,
just give it to me straight.

36:11.193 --> 36:12.654
[Adam] Chuck's sister was murdered.

36:13.571 --> 36:16.658
[Gord sighs] Well, why didn't
you say anything to Chuck?

36:16.741 --> 36:19.744
You think I want him
running around accusing everyone?

36:19.827 --> 36:22.914
- It's going to get ugly quick.
- Yeah, you're right.

36:22.997 --> 36:25.124
Well, tonight,
we'll burn the bodies.

36:25.207 --> 36:27.126
Tomorrow, we'll let
the police deal with it.

36:27.209 --> 36:28.711
Exactly.

36:31.381 --> 36:34.384
Oh, shit.
The grocery store's on fire.

36:34.467 --> 36:35.593
[Gord sighs]

36:39.389 --> 36:40.723
[fire extinguisher hissing]

36:47.188 --> 36:50.775
Amanda, you were the last one here.

36:50.858 --> 36:53.320
Are you sure you didn't see anything?

36:53.403 --> 36:55.697
No. But...

36:55.780 --> 36:57.532
But what?

36:57.615 --> 37:00.702
I mean, did you see anybody around?
A car? A truck?

37:00.785 --> 37:04.246
I think so.
It was an old truck.

37:05.998 --> 37:08.125
[Felix] Ronnie and Pat's pick-up.

37:10.127 --> 37:15.049
They almost burned the store down.
It's about time they learned a lesson.

37:15.132 --> 37:19.596
I agree, but first we need to finish
gathering the bodies and get them burned.

37:19.679 --> 37:21.806
Let's wait till tomorrow morning
when the fence is down

37:21.889 --> 37:24.183
and then we'll report it
to the authorities.

37:24.266 --> 37:28.771
Hey, if Pat and Ronnie did this,
they'll get their day.

37:30.315 --> 37:31.608
Fine.

37:49.459 --> 37:50.835
[door knob rattles]

38:20.365 --> 38:23.242
Minister Miller and Art Carey...

38:24.786 --> 38:26.328
Where are you?

38:44.639 --> 38:46.140
Have you seen Adam?

38:47.475 --> 38:50.269
No, I actually haven't.

39:07.787 --> 39:09.038
[gasps weakly]

39:12.750 --> 39:14.251
[Adam] Come on, Art Carey.

39:33.646 --> 39:34.647
Everybody!

39:36.566 --> 39:40.612
Before we get started,
maybe we should just... bow our heads,

39:40.695 --> 39:43.990
say a prayer for the ones
who haven't survived...

39:45.074 --> 39:47.118
who've gone too soon.

39:48.202 --> 39:52.331
Our mothers and fathers,
brothers and sisters.

39:54.626 --> 39:57.294
We never expected to be here.

39:57.378 --> 39:59.631
And, uh, for some of you,

39:59.714 --> 40:01.924
you're the last ones
left in your families.

40:02.008 --> 40:04.844
But just know that
once we get through this night...

40:06.178 --> 40:07.680
although things will never
be the same again,

40:07.764 --> 40:10.099
we will get through this.

40:26.448 --> 40:27.575
Got ya.

40:42.464 --> 40:44.133
[Wiley whimpering]

40:45.927 --> 40:47.512
[Wiley coughing]

40:53.475 --> 40:55.562
Wiley?
Wiley?

40:55.645 --> 40:57.730
[Chuck in distance]
Everybody, time to get started.

41:07.865 --> 41:09.200
Shit.

41:10.743 --> 41:12.286
[grunting]

41:12.369 --> 41:14.288
Come on.
Help!

41:19.877 --> 41:22.589
Somebody, please,
help me!

41:27.635 --> 41:28.636
Come on.

41:29.762 --> 41:31.931
Wiley, we've gotta get out of here.
