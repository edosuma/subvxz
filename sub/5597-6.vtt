See, baby looks perfectly happy.

07:57.216 --> 07:58.144
Little trooper.

07:58.194 --> 07:59.237
[groans]

07:59.287 --> 08:00.371
It hurts so much.

08:00.421 --> 08:01.724
Are you here on your own, Anne Marie?

08:01.774 --> 08:04.104
Yes. Marco's in Nepal.

08:04.154 --> 08:06.204
- He's the baby's father?
- And want to know the kicker?

08:06.206 --> 08:07.707
It's my fault. I sent him there.

08:07.805 --> 08:09.573
Anne Marie is a General in the forces.

08:09.575 --> 08:11.675
My husband's a Captain,
but the disaster response team

08:11.677 --> 08:13.077
deployed after the earthquake...

08:13.079 --> 08:15.011
Okay, you have a mass on your ovary,

08:15.079 --> 08:17.521
and it's putting pressure on the ureter.

08:17.683 --> 08:20.017
I can see
why you're in so much pain.

08:20.019 --> 08:20.949
You can sit up.

08:21.054 --> 08:23.405
Tell me there's something you can do.

08:23.489 --> 08:25.269
I'm gonna give you something
to manage the pain,

08:25.319 --> 08:27.680
and look forward to meeting
that wonderful baby.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.727
Mass is nothing to worry about.

08:29.729 --> 08:31.463
They're... they're usually benign.

08:31.530 --> 08:33.797
We can test for malignancy
after we remove it.

08:33.799 --> 08:35.308
Are you saying this could be cancer?

08:35.357 --> 08:36.509
Very unlikely.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.534
The mass shows no worrisome features.

08:38.537 --> 08:39.986
We see them all the time during pregnancy.

08:40.035 --> 08:41.062
So let's just take it out.

08:41.111 --> 08:43.553
We're gonna remove it about
six weeks after delivery.

08:43.683 --> 08:46.176
Can't we find out if it's cancer now?
What about an MRI?

08:46.178 --> 08:48.011
It's not advisable during pregnancy.

08:48.644 --> 08:52.166
My aunt died of ovarian cancer.
It's in my family.

08:52.426 --> 08:53.229
What about that test?

08:53.367 --> 08:54.506
The CA-125?

08:54.595 --> 08:57.127
It's not a good test for pregnant women.

08:57.177 --> 08:58.493
- I'm sorry.
- If I have cancer,

08:58.543 --> 08:59.906
I want to know about it now.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.491
I want that test.

09:01.493 --> 09:03.059
We're gonna get your pain under control

09:03.061 --> 09:05.128
and maybe something to help you feel calmer.

09:07.278 --> 09:09.065
I-I thought she had a right to know.

09:09.067 --> 09:10.600
The woman is pregnant, in pain, and alone.

09:10.602 --> 09:11.968
We're trying to minimize stress here.

09:11.970 --> 09:13.403
I believe that the doctors and patients

09:13.405 --> 09:14.671
need to be partners in their care.

09:14.673 --> 09:15.438
So do I.

09:15.568 --> 09:17.674
I also believe we're responsible
for the patient's welfare,

09:17.676 --> 09:19.209
both physically and emotionally.

09:19.211 --> 09:20.641
Shouldn't it be her decision, anyway?

09:20.708 --> 09:22.976
If she wants the CA-125,
why not just give it to her?

09:23.026 --> 09:24.914
Because the test is unreliable.

09:24.916 --> 09:27.350
Her levels are probably
elevated because she's pregnant.

09:27.352 --> 09:29.886
How do you think she would
deal with a false positive?

09:31.054 --> 09:32.755
Okay, so, what do we do now?

09:32.996 --> 09:34.524
I'm gonna go discuss her pain management

09:34.526 --> 09:35.525
with the pharmacy,

09:35.527 --> 09:37.026
and you are gonna go discuss with her

09:37.028 --> 09:38.528
why we're not gonna do the test.

09:38.530 --> 09:39.529
Yeah, right.

09:39.531 --> 09:41.403
Me, on my own, with an army General?

09:41.453 --> 09:42.865
You made the mess. You clean it up.

09:42.867 --> 09:44.929
But... no, no, no.

09:52.329 --> 09:54.628
Well, he came to me as a...

09:54.846 --> 09:57.112
A ghost. You can say it.

10:01.853 --> 10:02.788
And?

10:02.838 --> 10:05.195
And turns out he was
playing me the whole time.

10:05.722 --> 10:06.688
Why?

10:06.690 --> 10:09.040
To get out of jail.

10:09.259 --> 10:11.092
Nothing about the guy was normal.

10:11.094 --> 10:12.674
He even followed me home.

10:14.530 --> 10:15.696
Um, wait a minute.

10:15.698 --> 10:16.831
He was in our house?

10:17.900 --> 10:19.234
Why didn't you tell me?

10:19.236 --> 10:21.135
I didn't want to freak you out.

10:21.991 --> 10:23.537
Well, I'm freaked out now.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.613
I'm sorry, okay?

10:24.663 --> 10:26.020
Listen,

10:26.176 --> 10:29.143
I'll tell you anything
you want to know, just...

10:29.145 --> 10:30.444
Not here.

10:30.446 --> 10:31.814
What about a code?

10:32.015 --> 10:34.848
Like, instead of saying,
"seeing a ghost," we'll...

10:35.059 --> 10:37.284
I don't know,
"you were doing your taxes."

10:38.774 --> 10:40.127

10:48.163 --> 10:49.735
It's very common to develop these

The... the incidence level of
malignancy is incredibly low.

I didn't get where I am by waiting.

10:57.139 --> 10:58.003
Six weeks?

Unless you had a C-section.

11:00.912 --> 11:03.643
What? What are you talking about?

I-I just mean, uh,
if you were to deliver naturally,

11:08.095 --> 11:11.350
we'll wait before operating,
but if you should happen

11:11.352 --> 11:13.576
to require a caesarian section,

11:13.701 --> 11:15.100
we'll take the mass out
in the same operation.

Ohh!

No. I am not.

Uh, yeah, sometimes.

11:39.187 --> 11:40.724
Other times, it's a snap,

of doing... my taxes.

So, the, um... the curve of your rib

12:48.488 --> 12:51.857
is very similar in shape
to the curve of your ear.

12:51.991 --> 12:54.925
So we're gonna harvest three
small pieces of cartilage,

12:54.927 --> 12:56.692
and we shape them
and we wire them together

12:56.742 --> 12:58.467

12:58.565 --> 13:00.147
And then...
and this is the cool part.

16:47.263 --> 16:48.618
I tried saving him from himself,

16:48.620 --> 16:51.144
but I was unsuccessful.

16:52.658 --> 16:53.628
[sighs]

16:53.678 --> 16:55.120
We are giving this guy a second chance

16:55.170 --> 16:57.227
that he will most definitely throw away.

16:58.298 --> 16:59.395
That I would bet on.

16:59.397 --> 17:01.598
[sighs]

17:04.568 --> 17:06.055
Got his chart?

17:06.281 --> 17:08.082
Thank you.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.781
You're still here.

17:19.517 --> 17:22.012
I'm having a bona fide
out-of-body experience.

17:22.153 --> 17:23.784
I'm not going anywhere.

17:23.887 --> 17:25.329
Great.

17:26.455 --> 17:27.217
Yeah.

17:27.267 --> 17:29.291
Do you know how long I've waited for this?

17:29.492 --> 17:32.335
I've tried hypnosis, ayahuasca,
and now, finally...

17:32.385 --> 17:33.292
You were critically injured.

17:33.342 --> 17:34.830
Most people aren't...

17:35.111 --> 17:36.147
happy about that.

17:36.204 --> 17:37.242
It's totally uncharted territory.

17:37.292 --> 17:39.058
I'm loving it.

17:40.355 --> 17:43.099
Uh, most people also find
it a little disconcerting

17:43.187 --> 17:46.075
seeing themselves lying there like that.

17:46.077 --> 17:49.006
Yeah, I'm used to it. I got a twin.

17:49.080 --> 17:50.445
I grew up looking in the mirror.

17:50.447 --> 17:51.764
- You're identical?
- Only on the outside.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.047
Wait a minute.

17:53.049 --> 17:54.642
I thought, uh...

17:55.122 --> 17:56.917
I thought you said
you didn't have any family.

17:57.461 --> 18:01.018
I said I'm on my own, which I am.

18:01.759 --> 18:03.006
I don't speak to them.

18:03.056 --> 18:05.814
I don't have time for anyone
telling me how to live.

18:06.203 --> 18:08.430
Ohh! Ohh!

18:08.432 --> 18:11.309
- You okay?
- Ohh, my side is killing me.

18:11.769 --> 18:13.234
Aah!

18:22.985 --> 18:23.782
Hey.

18:23.832 --> 18:24.786
- Hey.
- What's going on?

18:24.836 --> 18:26.686
He's in pain. It's his side.

18:26.866 --> 18:29.065
[monitor beeps]

18:29.067 --> 18:30.534
I'm not seeing any elevations.

18:30.536 --> 18:33.036
Dude, you got to make this pain go away.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.542
Alex, Nick's here... the,
uh, one who does my taxes.

18:36.641 --> 18:38.975
[monitor beeping]

18:39.293 --> 18:40.995
Oh. Okay.

18:41.472 --> 18:43.593
Uh, Dr. Reid's gonna help you.

18:43.643 --> 18:44.847
Is the pain only on that side?

18:44.849 --> 18:45.848
Yeah, right here.

18:46.070 --> 18:48.280
Yeah, it's a sharp pain, right flank.

18:49.195 --> 18:50.953
When he fell, did he land on something?

18:51.351 --> 18:53.125
No, nothing. It was like four feet.

18:53.175 --> 18:55.033
- He says no.
- Medical history?

18:55.083 --> 18:57.859
Uh, I was in the hospital
as a kid, but, ohh!

18:58.082 --> 18:59.013
Now it's down here.

18:59.063 --> 19:00.128
Okay, now the pain is in his groin.

19:00.130 --> 19:01.396
Why were you in the hospital?

19:01.398 --> 19:03.344
Uh, some operation. My mother never said.

19:03.394 --> 19:04.966
He says operation when he was a kid.

19:04.968 --> 19:06.367
He doesn't know what nature.

19:06.369 --> 19:07.963
Well, he had a scar.

19:08.045 --> 19:09.056
Looked like from an appendectomy.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.573
Aah! Now it's in my leg... the other leg.

19:11.637 --> 19:14.055
Now the pain is in his thigh...
his other thigh.

19:15.009 --> 19:16.669
Radiating from groin to thigh.

19:16.719 --> 19:17.873
It must be his kidney or ureter.

19:17.923 --> 19:19.361
I'll get him on some antibiotics.

19:19.460 --> 19:20.891
[alarm beeping]

19:20.941 --> 19:22.350
He's going into shock.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.145
Are you thinking kidney failure?

19:23.195 --> 19:24.217
There's blood in the catheter.

19:24.219 --> 19:25.012
This isn't an infection.

19:25.062 --> 19:27.659
I need to get him
back in there and open him up.

19:28.319 --> 19:29.924
How's that pocket coming?

19:30.409 --> 19:31.658
It's developing nicely.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.377
Make sure you protect my perforators.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.750
His Darwin's tubercle is very subtle.

19:37.800 --> 19:41.765
And that is not a bad match,
if I do say so myself.

19:41.815 --> 19:43.039
It's beautiful.

19:43.089 --> 19:44.971
I just hope you get to finish the job.

19:45.546 --> 19:46.324
Drain is in.

19:46.374 --> 19:47.506
We re-attach in three weeks.

19:47.508 --> 19:49.075
He just needs to stay out
of trouble until then.

19:49.077 --> 19:50.476
Yeah, good luck with that.

19:50.478 --> 19:51.775
He can do it. I have faith.

19:51.825 --> 19:53.345
Okay, lift the skin.

19:53.848 --> 19:58.938
I am going to place the strut
on the level of the fascia.

19:59.153 --> 20:02.275
And then you can stitch it up.

20:02.396 --> 20:04.129
You go to the mat for all your patients?

20:04.179 --> 20:06.266
Even the rich kids with their nose jobs?

20:06.316 --> 20:07.814
Of course I do.

20:08.017 --> 20:11.926
The heart of plastics is the
possibility of transformation,

20:11.976 --> 20:13.643
of real change.

20:13.802 --> 20:15.901
I will always go to the mat for that.

20:16.030 --> 20:17.403
Well, it's too bad you can't give him

20:17.405 --> 20:19.377
a face transplant while you're at it

20:19.577 --> 20:21.551
because until he gets out of dodge...

20:21.601 --> 20:23.708
that's one thing my ex had figured out...

20:24.348 --> 20:26.294
never stop moving.

20:26.372 --> 20:28.323
Yes, because you can't hit a moving target.

20:28.373 --> 20:29.804
Exactly.

20:30.590 --> 20:32.125
Okay.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.829
Shall we finish this masterpiece?

20:34.879 --> 20:36.015
Yes.

20:36.065 --> 20:36.847
Are you ready?

20:36.897 --> 20:38.745
[both chuckle]

20:38.900 --> 20:41.035
[suction sucking]

20:41.547 --> 20:44.701
- That is so cool!
- [laughs]

20:44.963 --> 20:46.496
[laughing] Oh, my god!

20:46.498 --> 20:47.331
I told you.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.132
[both laugh]

20:49.134 --> 20:51.868
[moaning]

20:51.870 --> 20:53.236
No!

20:54.621 --> 20:56.172
Anne Marie,
you have to let me examine you.

20:56.174 --> 20:57.641
Your contractions are very close.

20:57.643 --> 21:00.577
How many times do I have to
tell you I'm not doing this?

21:01.646 --> 21:03.347
- Where the hell were you?
- Sorry to interrupt here.

21:03.349 --> 21:05.272
Ohh!

21:05.322 --> 21:06.915
Marco: Anne Marie, are you all right?

21:06.917 --> 21:08.708
- Can you hear me?
- We can hear you.

21:08.758 --> 21:09.777
Marco?

21:09.855 --> 21:12.100
So, the doctor says you're in labor.

21:12.150 --> 21:13.734
Okay, here's what you need to do.

21:13.784 --> 21:15.406
I want you to get General
Adams on the phone.

21:15.456 --> 21:16.911
I want an ambulance to the base,

21:16.961 --> 21:18.928
and then get them to set up an
operating room for me, okay?

21:18.978 --> 21:19.858
There's no time for that.

21:19.908 --> 21:22.002
Stand down. You have no authority here.

21:22.102 --> 21:24.047
These doctors are your superiors.

21:24.097 --> 21:26.065
You need to do what they say.

21:27.671 --> 21:29.692
[crying] I'm scared.

21:29.742 --> 21:32.188
I don't want to go through this without you.

21:32.778 --> 21:35.806
I'm here. I'm with you.

21:36.032 --> 21:38.913
Anne Marie, you need to trust me.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.451
You're about to become a mother.
Let me help you.

21:44.828 --> 21:46.076
Dr. Sekara,

21:46.126 --> 21:47.856
prep a birthing room.

21:47.858 --> 21:49.290
Okay.

21:51.827 --> 21:54.685
You can do this. I'm right here.

21:56.445 --> 21:57.974
The appendectomies aren't emergencies,

21:58.024 --> 21:59.298
so this surgery takes precedence.

21:59.348 --> 22:00.300
Oh, that's totally fine, Dr. Reid.

22:00.302 --> 22:01.668
I haven't operated on kidneys before.

22:02.213 --> 22:04.094
Well, if you're gonna
specialize in gen surg,

22:04.144 --> 22:05.071
you're gonna be seeing a lot of them.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.907
So, is it a crack in the kidney itself

22:06.909 --> 22:08.041
or damage to the ureter?

22:08.043 --> 22:09.777
It could be a tear in the renal artery.

22:10.677 --> 22:11.871
Wait, so, we're going in there

22:11.921 --> 22:13.956
without knowing
exactly what's wrong with him?

22:14.078 --> 22:15.718
He has a problem with his kidney.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.394
But what problem specifically?

22:17.444 --> 22:18.685
That's what we're going to find out.

22:18.687 --> 22:21.277
[water runs, stops]

22:21.911 --> 22:23.356
How can he have a creatinine of 400?

22:23.358 --> 22:24.791
His kidneys look normal.

22:24.793 --> 22:26.226
Yes, they do.

22:26.228 --> 22:27.327
So, where's the blood coming from?

22:27.329 --> 22:28.661
[alarm beeping]

22:28.663 --> 22:30.063
Better figure it out, guys.

22:30.114 --> 22:33.049
Pressure's 80 systolic. We're losing him.

22:33.534 --> 22:35.498
Page Charlie. I need him in here.

22:35.548 --> 22:37.329
Uh, why? This isn't a bone issue.

22:37.379 --> 22:38.639
Now.

22:39.308 --> 22:40.340
Thank you, Mrs. Crace.

22:40.342 --> 22:41.707
That was extremely generous of you.

22:41.709 --> 22:43.209
Well done, Dr. Bell.

22:43.211 --> 22:47.079
I may just see this unit up
and running in my lifetime.

22:47.081 --> 22:48.914
Well, it would be
because of your contribution.

22:48.916 --> 22:51.250
Oh, no, it's down to the two of you.

22:51.252 --> 22:52.884
You're quite a team.

22:52.886 --> 22:54.753
I can't argue with that.

22:54.755 --> 22:56.855
[chuckles]

22:58.224 --> 23:00.127
Get your hands off me!

23:00.535 --> 23:02.428
You don't touch me... ever.

23:02.430 --> 23:04.129
And you sure as hell don't send me flowers

23:04.131 --> 23:05.713
after what you did.

23:07.370 --> 23:09.305
Which is what?

23:11.504 --> 23:13.616
What is it I did, Dawn?

23:14.205 --> 23:16.436
And why the big shift from this morning?

23:18.845 --> 23:21.880
The only reason why I have let you

23:21.882 --> 23:23.715
within 100 feet of me

23:23.717 --> 23:25.884
is because
the hospital needs this money,

23:25.886 --> 23:27.786
and I am not gonna jeopardize that.

23:29.214 --> 23:30.154
Dawn, I think you need to slow down.

23:30.156 --> 23:32.331
Don't you tell me...

23:32.461 --> 23:33.725
what to do.

23:33.860 --> 23:36.927
♪

23:40.971 --> 23:41.765
Yeah?

23:41.767 --> 23:43.101
I'm looking at the kidneys,
and they're fine.

23:43.103 --> 23:44.135
Not crushed from his fall?

23:44.137 --> 23:45.697
No urine output.

23:45.805 --> 23:47.138
And B.P. can't get much lower.

23:47.140 --> 23:48.406
They are completely intact.

23:48.408 --> 23:49.340
What else?

23:49.590 --> 23:50.824
Uh,

23:51.421 --> 23:52.520
I don't know.
He's taken a few drugs in his time.

23:52.570 --> 23:53.302
Maybe a reaction?

23:53.352 --> 23:54.525
No, tox screen was clear.

23:54.575 --> 23:55.533
He has an identical twin.

23:55.583 --> 23:56.613
Maybe we should contact him.

23:56.673 --> 23:58.065
Identical twin... the scar.

23:58.115 --> 23:59.685
He must have had a kidney transplant.

23:59.735 --> 24:00.869
Wait, what?

24:01.021 --> 24:03.343
Yeah, there it is. Way down. Clamp.

24:03.393 --> 24:04.659
A ruptured renal artery?

24:04.709 --> 24:06.289
Yes. More suction.

24:07.492 --> 24:09.287
So, his twin gave him one of his kidneys?

24:09.337 --> 24:10.610
Why wouldn't his parents have told him

24:10.660 --> 24:11.797
he had a transplant?

24:11.930 --> 24:13.694
To protect
their standing in the community.

24:14.143 --> 24:17.498
The soul of every sort
of flesh is in its blood.

24:17.798 --> 24:20.526
[sighs] 5.0 polypropylene. Loops.

24:20.974 --> 24:22.471
B.P. rising.

24:23.106 --> 24:23.957
I think you got it.

24:24.007 --> 24:24.926
Okay.

24:24.976 --> 24:26.889
Dr. Reid, how the hell did
you put all that together?

24:26.939 --> 24:28.859
Let's just focus.

24:30.405 --> 24:31.605
Ohh. [winces]

24:31.607 --> 24:32.673
This rush...

24:32.675 --> 24:34.675
I've just never felt
anything like it before.

24:35.075 --> 24:36.561
Now I just want it to go away.

24:36.611 --> 24:37.697
Hang in there, Nick.

24:37.747 --> 24:39.667
Just a little while longer, okay?

24:40.160 --> 24:41.662
If I die...

24:42.316 --> 24:43.249
You're in good hands.

24:43.251 --> 24:44.684
That is not gonna happen, okay?

24:44.686 --> 24:46.886
Dude, if I die, let my mother know

24:46.888 --> 24:48.755
I know what she did, please.

24:49.805 --> 24:50.684
What, with the transplant?

24:50.734 --> 24:52.392
What did she do?

24:52.700 --> 24:54.327
She's a Jehovah's witness.

24:54.329 --> 24:55.828
She risked her whole world for me.

25:00.151 --> 25:02.330
Well, she loved you.

25:02.972 --> 25:05.103
I'm betting she still does.

25:05.815 --> 25:09.344
If I die, just...
just tell her I miss them.

25:10.811 --> 25:11.944
Why don't you just hang in there,

25:11.946 --> 25:15.580
and you can tell her yourself?

25:19.652 --> 25:22.628
If the transplanted kidney is
buried in the false pelvis,

25:22.678 --> 25:24.389
how did you know to find it?

25:24.904 --> 25:26.257
Well, I realized that the scar

25:26.346 --> 25:27.644
I thought was from an appendectomy

25:27.694 --> 25:29.679
was actually a pediatric transplant.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.596
But there was no mention of any

25:31.598 --> 25:33.864
anti-rejection medication on his chart.

25:34.008 --> 25:35.576
That's because a kidney
from an identical twin

Charlie: I guess that's what
they mean by "identical."

36:58.761 --> 37:00.603
I told you about him?

37:00.775 --> 37:03.797
Um... yeah.

37:04.162 --> 37:06.098
I must have been really out of it.

37:06.263 --> 37:07.732
Did you also know that your brother

37:07.782 --> 37:10.946
gave you one of his kidneys
when you were kids?

37:11.718 --> 37:13.318
That's not possible.

37:13.796 --> 37:14.991
My mother never would have agreed

37:15.041 --> 37:17.692
to an operation that
risked a blood transfusion.

37:18.064 --> 37:18.868
You sure about that?

37:18.918 --> 37:21.811
Not even to save her son's life?

37:21.861 --> 37:23.387
She's Jehovah's witness.

37:23.437 --> 37:24.355
Devout.

37:24.405 --> 37:26.081
My brother, too.

37:27.330 --> 37:28.768
Well, we were pretty surprised

37:28.818 --> 37:31.104
when we found three kidneys in there.

37:31.457 --> 37:34.554
I'm guessing
that she found it easier to lie than

37:34.930 --> 37:37.701
to watch her own child suffer.

37:39.265 --> 37:40.045
She was always so worried

37:40.095 --> 37:42.497
about what everyone else would think.

37:47.915 --> 37:50.216
Oh, uh, also, when you were out of it,

37:50.266 --> 37:52.728
you kind of asked me to call her.

37:52.778 --> 37:53.379
I did?

37:53.429 --> 37:56.452
Yeah, you said that she'd
want to know if you died.

37:56.912 --> 37:58.118
I'm...

37:58.400 --> 38:01.034
guessing that she'd rather
know that you're alive.

38:31.218 --> 38:32.892
I was looking at the board for tomorrow,

38:32.942 --> 38:35.785
and I noticed
that I'm assisting Dr. Bala

38:35.835 --> 38:37.489
on a major liver resection.
