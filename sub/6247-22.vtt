00:01.080 --> 00:05.596
AII I ask is that you stop by and identify
the skull as Assyrian, Hittite or Egyptian.

00:05.680 --> 00:08.433
- I need my notes for court.
- There's a photocopy.

00:08.520 --> 00:12.911
Last time I read from photocopies, the
defence lawyer told the jury I was winging it.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.878
- Ready. Chop-chop! - I
can't find my originaI notes.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.191
- Photocopy them.
- Last time the defence lawyer told the jury...

00:19.280 --> 00:21.157
It was a ploy, it failed. Let's go.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.993
- I found glass and pollen. What do you want?
- Pollen.

00:24.080 --> 00:27.117
- Perhaps you could swing by Archaeology...
- No swinging.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.431
Her height makes no sense
and her spine length is wacky.

00:30.520 --> 00:34.354
Calculate the height off the femur
and assume the fire shrunk her spine.

00:34.440 --> 00:37.830
You shouldn't talk about other cases
on court day. You'll get confused.

00:37.920 --> 00:41.356
- One question. Assyrian, Hittite or Egyptian...
- What's up?

00:41.440 --> 00:45.035
Buttercup. If you sign off the tissue
markers, Angela can finish the face.

00:45.120 --> 00:48.590
- Why did you say "buttercup"?
- It's amusing rhyming linguistically.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.875
This is the latest Jane Doe from limbo.

00:50.960 --> 00:53.474
I have a rhyming linguini
- see you later, alligator.

00:53.560 --> 00:55.915
Please don't refer to
bone storage as limbo.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.391
There are thousands of remains waiting
to be identified. Limbo seems appropriate.

01:00.480 --> 01:03.472
- No sign of fouI play.
- If you've time for this, you've time for me.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.235
Tissue depth of the cheek bones and jaw
line looks a little deep, otherwise...

01:07.320 --> 01:09.914
Out of limbo, back on earth
and on our way to court.

01:12.000 --> 01:15.549
- Temperance.
- David. What are you doing here?

01:15.640 --> 01:18.200
- She has to get to court.
- Booth, nice to see you,

01:18.280 --> 01:20.555
especially when I'm not in custody.

01:20.640 --> 01:23.996
I read your manuscript. I couldn't
wait to tell you how great it is.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.753
- Thank you. Really?
- You read her manuscript?

01:26.840 --> 01:29.035
<i>Her second noveI
- Bone Free.</i>

01:29.120 --> 01:32.749
<i>- It's like Born Free except no lions.
- Yuck on the title. Am I in it?</i>

01:32.840 --> 01:34.478
- No.
- Definitely.

01:34.560 --> 01:39.156
- We have to get to court.
- Hope you have your originaI notes...

01:39.240 --> 01:43.870
- Told you, Booth!
- No, Bones! We don't have time!

01:43.960 --> 01:47.555
Three minutes! I'll
wait for you in the car.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.151
- So, are you two...
- Yeah, sort of. Is that a problem?

01:55.240 --> 02:01.713
Yeah. Bones is very literaI, so in
future, no jokey advice on court day.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.871
Is something wrong?

02:12.160 --> 02:14.674
- What's this?
- Zack's Jane Doe.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.797
He said that you OK'd
the tissue markers.

02:17.880 --> 02:22.510
No, that can't be right. That can't
possibly be right. You did it wrong.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.591
It's a mistake, Angela.

02:24.680 --> 02:28.275
All right, fine.
Sweetie, I'll turn it off.

02:29.000 --> 02:31.560
The artefact bag from your
Jane Doe, do you have it?

02:31.640 --> 02:37.590
Yes. I also have three bags of soiI
samples from where the remains were buried.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074

03:10.680 --> 03:15.196
Any of you see Bones? We're
due in court, like, hello, now.

03:17.720 --> 03:19.278
What?

03:19.360 --> 03:20.634
This.

03:21.840 --> 03:23.910
Totally freaked her out.

03:24.360 --> 03:26.749
<i>My theory
- caffeine intolerance.</i>

03:26.840 --> 03:31.277
Yeah, you're gonna want to take Dr
Brennan off the witness list today.

03:31.360 --> 03:33.635
No, she can't make it into court.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.073
Thanks.

03:35.160 --> 03:39.358
- What's going on?
- That... is Christine Brennan.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.431
Good God.

03:44.080 --> 03:46.548
You just found Bones' mother.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.154
- I have to miss court.
- I know.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.629
I remember this belt buckle.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.558
I borrowed it without asking.

04:34.640 --> 04:36.949
First day of high schooI.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.109
My father had it specially made for
my mother because she loved dolphins.

04:42.200 --> 04:45.237
Bones... I'm sorry.

04:45.320 --> 04:49.916
I always knew that for my
parents to disappear like that,

04:50.000 --> 04:52.878
they... they had to be dead.

04:52.960 --> 04:57.750
I thought that when it was
confirmed, I'd feeI relief.

04:59.160 --> 05:01.230
- But...
- It's still bad news.

05:01.320 --> 05:06.713
- You have the file, Zack?
- Jane Doe, number 129, 09/98.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.597
- Where was she found?
- Bones.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.399
What does it say?

05:11.920 --> 05:14.275
"In September of 1998,

05:14.360 --> 05:18.558
a grave-digging crew at the Sunset Memories
cemetery in Salisbury, Pennsylvania,

05:18.640 --> 05:22.519
uncovered human remains in a completely
advanced stage of decomposition. "

05:22.600 --> 05:24.830
- Is it from a grave?
- No, it appears somebody

05:24.920 --> 05:28.310
dug a hole at the edge of the
cemetery and plopped the body in there.

05:28.400 --> 05:30.391
<i>- Zack!
- Sorry.</i>

05:32.160 --> 05:35.072
"The locaI coroner found no
obvious evidence of fouI play

05:35.160 --> 05:39.153
and sent the remains, a few artefacts
and soiI samples to the Jeffersonian,

05:39.240 --> 05:41.879
hoping we could identify her. "

05:41.960 --> 05:44.315
Your mother's been here
as long as you have.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.356
<i>- Zack.
- Sorry.</i>

05:47.000 --> 05:49.878
But they both got here in 1998.

05:51.040 --> 05:56.319
Dr Brennan. Miss Montenegro has
volunteered to drive you home.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.274
Temperance.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.351
Go home.

06:39.640 --> 06:43.918
- It's after midnight.
- I was driving by, I saw the lights.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.833
Thought you might like some Wong Foo's.

06:46.920 --> 06:50.356
- You saw my lights from the road?
- That is correct.

06:53.600 --> 06:55.591
All right.

06:57.800 --> 07:01.076
After you gave me your parents'
file, I did some poking around.

07:01.160 --> 07:02.878
You worked on it?

07:02.960 --> 07:08.830
There wasn't much I could do. There
was no evidence, no clearjurisdiction.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.911
Listen, Bones.

07:12.480 --> 07:16.792
Finding your mother's remains means
I can open an officiaI FBI case.

07:16.880 --> 07:21.192
I mean, for the first time, a
reaI investigation can occur.

07:26.600 --> 07:30.513
Three days after my parents
disappeared, they found our car

07:30.600 --> 07:33.637
at a rest stop 1,000 miles
from where we lived in Chicago.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.793
I found it in an impound lot in Jersey.
I'm having it trucked to the Jeffersonian.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.030
They kept it all those years?

07:40.120 --> 07:42.395
Well, nobody claimed it.

07:42.480 --> 07:48.112
Your father was a high-schooI teacher.
He had no trouble with anyone at work.

07:48.200 --> 07:53.877
- Your mother, that's a... different
matter. - She was a book-keeper.

07:53.960 --> 08:00.479
She was a witness for the prosecution,
twice, on evasion charges. That gives motive.

08:01.080 --> 08:03.071
Then there's your brother.

08:04.360 --> 08:08.638
- Russ. The brother who deserted me.
- He's on parole.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.429
He ran a chop shop, processing
stolen cars for parts.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.638
Figures.

08:14.720 --> 08:19.157
He says that you blame him for
your parents' disappearance.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.549
- You talked to Russ?
- I called him.

08:21.640 --> 08:25.997
Just asked him a few routine
questions. He didn't give me much.

08:26.080 --> 08:30.312
We're gonna find out what
happened to your mom, OK?

08:32.799 --> 08:37.078
Adipocere and decomp residues in the soiI
indicate the body was buried for five years.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.948
That's congruent with pH in the
soiI, climate and degree of decomp.

08:41.039 --> 08:44.236
No, seven years. It
should be seven years.

08:45.160 --> 08:49.631
I'm still going through the soiI samples, but
something may allow me to be more specific.

08:49.720 --> 08:52.154
She was buried near Christmas 1991.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.595
- I need the room.
- The whole lab? For what?

08:54.680 --> 08:57.353
It's a cop way of saying "Get lost".

08:58.720 --> 09:01.234
- What?
- When you gave me the file on your parents,

09:01.320 --> 09:06.519
I looked back into their lives three
to four years before they disappeared.

09:06.600 --> 09:11.674
Jobs, friends. Then I looked back a
little further and I found out that...

09:11.760 --> 09:15.469
Christine Brennan
didn't exist before 1978.

09:15.560 --> 09:19.189
What are you telling me? That
this woman isn't my mother?

09:19.280 --> 09:24.308
I was born in 1976.
Obviously my mother existed.

09:24.400 --> 09:29.349
Do you know the most common
way of creating an identity?

09:30.480 --> 09:34.473
Getting the birth certificate
of someone deceased

09:34.560 --> 09:39.475
who was born the same year you
were and... take over that identity.

09:39.560 --> 09:43.633
I found one Matthew
Brennan, born and died 1948.

09:46.240 --> 09:47.878
You understand?

09:47.960 --> 09:50.872
I don't know what it means. I
don't know what any of it means.

09:50.960 --> 09:55.351
It means that your parents
weren't... who you thought they were.

09:55.440 --> 09:58.318
It means that they were living under...

09:58.400 --> 10:00.789
assumed identities.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.274
<i>Every minute this is
down, I'm losing money.</i>

10:08.360 --> 10:14.151
You want faster work, grab yourself
a cup of coffee. Let me alone, man.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.758
- Are you licensed for this job?
- You're a cop.

10:19.840 --> 10:22.308
- You know who recognises cops?
- Other cops.

10:22.400 --> 10:24.231
And crooks.

10:24.320 --> 10:28.836
I talked to you a couple of
months ago on the phone. I'm Booth.

10:28.920 --> 10:33.516
Are you going to ask me some
more questions about my childhood?

10:38.280 --> 10:42.068
- You found my mother?
- Your sister did the ID.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.752
- What about Dad?
- No.

10:44.840 --> 10:48.958
- What do you want?
- You remember being anyone else besides...

10:49.040 --> 10:50.439
- Russ Brennan?
- No.

10:50.520 --> 10:54.433
- You wouldn't lie to me, would you?
- Cops always think I'm Iying.

10:55.480 --> 10:59.598
- I want you to come to DC and help with this.
- I got ajob, man.

10:59.680 --> 11:04.674
An alternative is I just cite you for
performing unlicensed repairs on heavy equipment.

11:04.760 --> 11:08.036
Get your parole
revoked. Tell you what...

11:08.120 --> 11:10.918
You give me a call
when you get into town.

11:11.000 --> 11:15.278
Oh, if you ask me, this...
this thing here is beyond hope.

11:21.280 --> 11:23.271
Look at that. It works.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.029
I'll see you soon.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.471
- What is it?
- A clump of cellulose.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.835
Came from the soiI
samples at the buriaI site,

11:43.920 --> 11:47.356
- from the same depth as her bones.
- You said you had a giant problem.

11:47.440 --> 11:50.750
- I used the laser scanning microscope.
- Which one is that?

11:50.840 --> 11:54.515
Looks like an espresso machine. It
showed this is mass-produced cardboard.

11:54.600 --> 11:57.034
Electron dispersion
spectroscopy indicates

11:57.120 --> 12:00.032
the cardboard is coated
with unsaturated monomers...

12:00.120 --> 12:02.395
Hodgins. What's the giant problem?

12:02.480 --> 12:08.077
<i>It's a movie ticket. A little UV analysis,
some guesswork, I get The Fugitive.</i>

12:08.160 --> 12:11.232
So what? You don't like
Brennan's mom's taste in movies?

12:11.320 --> 12:15.518
<i>The Fugitive was the third
top grossing film of 1993.</i>

12:17.560 --> 12:20.393
Brennan's parents disappeared
in December of 1991.

12:20.480 --> 12:23.119
Yet Mom's going to Harrison
Ford movies two years later.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.316
<i>Oh, God. This is giant.</i>

12:25.400 --> 12:28.198
What do I do? Pretend
I never found this?

12:35.040 --> 12:39.431
<i>- Dr Brennan.
- Yes. Did you find something in the soiI?</i>

12:39.520 --> 12:45.834
Yeah, uh... This was in the soiI
samples alongside your mother's remains.

12:45.920 --> 12:49.833
<i>- A movie ticket?
- Rialto Theater, 9pm show of The Fugitive.</i>

12:49.920 --> 12:53.959
- September 22nd, 1993.
- How did it get there?

12:54.040 --> 12:58.955
Either your mother had it when she
was buried, or it was buried with her.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.396
- Either way, it dates the buriaI.
- No, that's impossible.

13:02.480 --> 13:04.675
My mother disappeared in 1991.

13:04.760 --> 13:08.116
It's possible Mom was buried
somewhere else, then moved.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.192
- No, that's not possible.
- Maybe it is.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.518
We decided to tell you the truth.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.233
And this is the truth.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.753
- You all right?
- I'm pretty sure I found cause of death.

13:31.840 --> 13:33.478
- Zack.
- Yes, Dr Brennan?

13:33.560 --> 13:36.199
See the discolouration on
the inside of the skull?

13:36.280 --> 13:41.115
Left side. Extending
from the coronaI suture.

13:41.200 --> 13:46.558
Crossing the superior and inferior
temporaI lines to the squamosaI suture.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.710
SubduraI haematoma.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.791
Whoo. A big one.

13:53.520 --> 13:56.557
- Dr Brennan.
- Probably fataI.

13:56.640 --> 14:01.634
There are no indications of
a blow to the outer skull.

14:03.280 --> 14:09.150
Scan the outside of the skull, look for
histologicaI changes, microscopic modelling.

14:09.240 --> 14:12.038
- I don't want to talk to him.
- Bones.

14:12.120 --> 14:17.240
Bones... All right, Zack, if this guy
moves, shoot him with a tranquilliser dart.

14:17.320 --> 14:19.515
I don't actually have
a tranquilliser gun.

14:19.600 --> 14:22.160
Hey, Bones. Come on.

14:22.240 --> 14:25.391
My mother died of a subduraI
haematoma. Bleeding in the brain.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.358
- You want to proceed rationally?
- Chances are...

14:28.440 --> 14:31.955
the subduraI haematoma was
caused by a blow to the head.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.429
You got the how, now let's get the who.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.317
You just told me that
your mother was murdered.

14:38.400 --> 14:42.279
I mean, who better to
help us than your brother?

14:44.680 --> 14:46.671
Mom loved dolphins.

14:47.640 --> 14:50.074
This was mine.

14:50.160 --> 14:54.358
My favourite marble. What
was she doing with that?

14:55.720 --> 14:59.633
- Where did Booth find you?
- It's not hard for the FBI to find a parolee.

14:59.720 --> 15:03.998
- I didn't ask how, I asked where.
- Morehead City, North Carolina.

15:04.080 --> 15:08.073
I call every year on your
birthday. You never pick up.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.196
Take a hint.

15:12.040 --> 15:14.713
- Could I have this, please?
- It's evidence.

15:14.800 --> 15:20.079
- Of what? It's a kid's marble.
- It's the rules. I can't let you have it.

15:21.080 --> 15:25.153
Same old Tempe. Never
met a rule worth breaking.

15:25.240 --> 15:27.754
Same old Russ. On parole.

15:32.240 --> 15:35.118
I might send Russ in to
describe some people to you.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.838
OK. What people?

15:36.920 --> 15:41.038
- People a seven-year-old might remember.
- That's a little vague there, Booth.

15:41.120 --> 15:44.157
The drawing
- that's important. I trust your instincts.

15:44.240 --> 15:48.631
- When it comes to men? -
Ha-ha. When it comes to suspects.

15:48.720 --> 15:53.191
Why do you think that
Bones asked her boyfriend...

15:53.840 --> 15:57.310
to read her book, and not me?

15:57.400 --> 16:02.155
Maybe because there was just
too much of me in the story.

16:04.280 --> 16:09.274
<i>She was embarrassed. You think? Maybe...</i>

16:09.360 --> 16:11.510
Booth. Yeah.

16:12.080 --> 16:14.469
I'm on my way. Thanks.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.915
The family carjust arrived.

16:22.960 --> 16:27.351
- Are we looking for anything in particular?
- Treat it like a brand-new crime scene.

16:27.440 --> 16:31.513
Tear through the whole car, treat it
and go through it with a fine-tooth comb.

16:31.600 --> 16:33.033
That's our old car.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.715
The name of my schooI is
scraped off. Woodside Elementary.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.756
They said they didn't find anything.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.991
There was a bloodstain,
front seat, passenger side.

16:42.080 --> 16:45.595
Guys, everybody. I need space, now.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.513
- What, now?
- Yeah, now.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.319
Take five, everybody.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.118
Twice in two days.

16:53.200 --> 16:57.591
I had NCIC database check for a
married couple who disappeared in 1978.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.750
Meet Max and Ruth Keenan.

17:00.880 --> 17:07.148
<i>- That's Mom and Dad all right.
- The NCIC database? That's... criminals.</i>

17:09.000 --> 17:12.037
My parents were on the
list of federaI offenders?

17:12.119 --> 17:15.112
How do you like that? Guess a
criminaI nature runs in the family.

17:15.200 --> 17:21.150
You were seven years old, Russ. Old
enough to remember. What is your reaI name?

17:22.160 --> 17:24.878
- What is my reaI name?
- Bones, it's here in the file.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.758
No! No! I want him to tell me.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.119
What is my reaI name, Russ?

17:36.960 --> 17:38.951
My name was Kyle.

17:39.800 --> 17:41.950
Your name was Joy.

17:42.040 --> 17:44.156
You are not my brother.

17:44.760 --> 17:46.796
- Bones.
- No! He lied about that.

17:46.880 --> 17:52.557
What else are you Iying about?
What else are you not telling us?

17:59.960 --> 18:04.351
At first, I thought the worst
thing was that they were... missing.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.829
Except dead means no more hope.

18:07.480 --> 18:12.474
My mother was alive for almost
two years after they disappeared.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.472
- She abandoned me.
- You don't know that.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.795
You finally got to slap Russ.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.270
You've been wanting
to do that for years.

18:23.280 --> 18:25.669
I worshipped him, you know?

18:29.880 --> 18:32.394
God, he was so cooI.

18:32.480 --> 18:36.439
Everyone knew I was Russ
Brennan's little sister.

18:36.520 --> 18:41.310
I wasn't cooI or pretty,
so being his sister...

18:42.440 --> 18:45.000
You know that game Marco Polo?

18:45.080 --> 18:50.074
I'd be sitting in class and I'd
hear out the window, "Marco".

18:52.040 --> 18:58.479
It'd be Russ, checking in on me and letting
everyone know that I was his little sister.

18:58.560 --> 19:00.869
Did you "Polo"?

19:00.960 --> 19:03.997
Yeah, sometimes it would be
the only word I said all day.

19:04.080 --> 19:06.275
Polo.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.592
Then Mom and Dad disappeared and...

19:11.560 --> 19:13.551
Russ took off.

19:18.000 --> 19:21.959
Suddenly, no one cared where I was.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.750
I miss that.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.877
Someone caring where I am all the time.

19:29.960 --> 19:34.590
Bones! Bones, are you up there?
Come on, let's go. Chop-chop!

19:36.200 --> 19:40.193
I found the agent that was
assigned to your parents' case.

19:40.520 --> 19:46.834
I was the FBI liaison in a bank robbery task
force working out of Cincinnati in the '70s.

19:46.920 --> 19:52.313
Secret service, state police, ATF, all of
us after a pretty bad bunch of armed robbers

19:52.400 --> 19:55.551
working Ohio, Kentucky, Iowa...

19:55.640 --> 19:57.676
You know, excuse me.

19:57.760 --> 20:01.435
Am I to understand that I'm addressing
the family of one of these robbers?

20:01.520 --> 20:04.159
Max and Ruth Keenan's children.

20:07.080 --> 20:11.835
Max and Ruth. Yeah. They never
really belonged in that crew.

20:11.920 --> 20:14.559
- Why?
- They worked smart.

20:14.640 --> 20:17.438
Specialised in safe
deposit boxes, no guns.

20:17.520 --> 20:23.152
They'd either con their way in or case out
the place, break back in on the weekend.

20:23.240 --> 20:26.676
Took their time. We never got a
handle on the size of their scores.

20:26.760 --> 20:31.754
- Why?
- People keep jewellery and cash in the boxes.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.229
And stuff they don't
want to report stolen.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.790
None of us understood why stand-up
criminals like Max and Ruth

20:37.880 --> 20:40.678
would join this
Midwest strong-arm crew.

20:40.760 --> 20:44.958
Links to white supremacists, reaI
dedication to firearms and violence.

20:45.040 --> 20:50.956
Ajob went bad. Two innocent bystanders
were killed, one trooper, seven wounded.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.713
- When was that?
- July 4th, 1978.

20:53.800 --> 20:56.678
- Never caught 'em?
- Not us. No.

20:56.760 --> 21:02.232
A few years later, one of 'em turned State's
evidence for an FBI agent out of Louisville.

21:02.320 --> 21:06.108
Sent the rest to jaiI. My
understanding is they're all dead.

21:06.200 --> 21:09.078
Our parents were bank robbers?

21:09.160 --> 21:13.312
Who morphed into a high-schooI
science teacher and a book-keeper?

21:13.400 --> 21:16.676
Their particular brand of
safety deposit break-ins stopped.

21:16.760 --> 21:20.753
At the time, I figured the strong-arm
crew killed them for their cut.

21:20.840 --> 21:25.311
- Agent Booth, we found blood in the car.
- We expected that.

21:25.400 --> 21:31.032
Yeah, but here's the wrinkle. We got
blood from two separate individuals.

21:32.120 --> 21:36.511
These two DNA charts are from the blood in
the car. These are from Dr Brennan and Russ.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.513
These three match and this one does not.

21:40.600 --> 21:44.479
- These three people are related?
- This is Mom, me and Russ.

21:44.560 --> 21:48.917
But this chart
- a male, but it's definitely not your father.

21:49.000 --> 21:55.189
OK, so we'll run it through CODIS and the
Convicted Offender Index, see what pops up.

21:57.960 --> 22:03.751
So you describe someone to me
and I draw them. That's the drill.

22:03.840 --> 22:05.637
- Who do I describe?
- I don't know yet.

22:05.720 --> 22:10.077
Booth put us together so I could
charm you into telling me the truth.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.390
Trust me. I got no more truth.

22:13.760 --> 22:19.278
Your sister is my best friend. So when
she says you can't be trusted, I trust her.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.794
This is you being charming?

22:22.560 --> 22:27.475
- Does Tempe really hate me that much?
- Russ, she loves you.

22:27.560 --> 22:33.078
It would be easier if she hated you. Hate
is a lot easier to deaI with than love.

22:33.160 --> 22:36.152
Especially disappointed love.

22:36.240 --> 22:41.473
You know what's ironic? Tempe doesn't
trust me because I kept a promise.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.869
What promise?

22:46.680 --> 22:51.151
Seven years old, Dad and me in
the back yard. This was in Ohio.

22:51.240 --> 22:55.358
My dad tells me, "You're
not Kyle any more. "

22:55.440 --> 22:58.830
"Forget about Kyle. You're Russ. "

23:00.160 --> 23:04.153
He says, "If you ever tell
anyone, the police, anyone,

23:04.240 --> 23:08.119
you'll be killing your
mother and your sister. "

23:08.200 --> 23:12.239
"Swear," he says. "You swear on your
baby sister's life you won't tell. "

23:12.320 --> 23:15.835
He makes me say my new name 100
times. "Russ Brennan, Russ Brennan. "

23:15.920 --> 23:21.199
He says it with me. "Russ Brennan,
Russ Brennan, Russ Brennan. "

23:23.480 --> 23:26.677
Around that time, when Kyle became Russ,

23:27.240 --> 23:31.279
maybe you saw someone, maybe
you saw someone who scared you.

23:33.680 --> 23:37.673
Someone who scared you
because you had instincts.

23:37.760 --> 23:41.196
The instincts of a frightened kid.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.953
Was there someone like that?

23:46.920 --> 23:48.911
Yeah.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.268
A man came to the house one day.

23:55.720 --> 24:01.078
My dad said if I ever saw this guy
again, to grab my sister and hide.

24:01.160 --> 24:05.039
Well, when you're ready,
you'll describe that man to me.

24:06.360 --> 24:08.351
All right.

24:17.280 --> 24:23.435
If you keep bringing Chinese food in the
middle of the night, we'll both get fat.

24:23.520 --> 24:25.795
- I know what you've been thinking.
- I doubt it.

24:25.880 --> 24:32.194
You've been thinking that your family
is made up of liars and criminals.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.874
And that makes you feeI lonely.

24:36.560 --> 24:40.792
- There's a story here we don't know yet.
- Like what?

24:40.880 --> 24:43.633
Bones, "don't know"
means it's a mystery.

24:45.800 --> 24:48.553
What were your parents like?

24:48.640 --> 24:50.312
My parents...

24:50.400 --> 24:56.509
My dad, he, uh... he drove
Thuds and Phantoms in Vietnam.

24:56.600 --> 25:01.116
Those are fighterjets. After that,
he was a barber in Philadelphia.

25:01.200 --> 25:06.354
My mom, she wrote jingles for
a locaI advertising agency.

25:06.440 --> 25:11.468
So they didn't go out at night
after you were asleep and rob banks?

25:13.640 --> 25:16.074
Listen, Bones, you know...

25:17.160 --> 25:20.391
Parents have secret lives.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.310
If they didn't, they
wouldn't be parents.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.908
It is a little late
for Chinese, isn't it?

25:30.000 --> 25:33.197
Thanks for the meaI. See you tomorrow.

25:44.960 --> 25:49.511
- Dr Brennan, is it morning?
- No, I couldn't sleep. Why are you still here?

25:49.600 --> 25:54.355
We're all here. No one's leaving untiI we
figure out what happened to your mother.

25:54.440 --> 25:55.953
Thank you.

25:56.040 --> 25:58.634
Don't thank me. I'm failing.

25:58.720 --> 26:02.156
I've gone over the skull and
found no evidence of remodelling,

26:02.240 --> 26:07.360
which makes no sense because any wound that
results in a subduraI haematoma that big

26:07.440 --> 26:09.431
should leave a mark on the living bone.

26:09.520 --> 26:12.671
What if the subduraI haematoma
started out much smaller?

26:12.760 --> 26:16.514
- And grew over time?
- Over the course of, say, a year.

26:16.600 --> 26:21.116
That might explain the gap between the time
she got an injury and the time she was buried.

26:21.200 --> 26:24.158
Then the blow itself might not
have left a mark on the bone.

26:24.240 --> 26:28.028
Show me the surface of the skull directly
above the centre of the haematoma.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.680
100 times magnification.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.751
Go to 500.

26:34.240 --> 26:38.199
- See here?
- Microscopic fractures on the osteons.

26:38.280 --> 26:42.717
And is that the result of bleeding
into the interstitiaI spaces?

26:42.800 --> 26:45.268
I can map the fractured osteons.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.715
That might lead us to the weapon.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.433
- I'm awake.
- Yeah. I can see that.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.639
- Got a break on the DNA in the car.
- You know who it is?

27:09.720 --> 27:14.953
Not exactly. It's a closed file. Whoever it is
is in the Witness Protection. I'll make a request.

27:15.040 --> 27:18.510
- What if he had a face?
- Who's that?

27:18.600 --> 27:23.071
Someone your dad pointed out to Russ when
he was seven. Somebody he's still afraid of.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.549
I'm gonna play hardball
with Witness Protection.

27:25.640 --> 27:28.393
If they don't cooperate, I'll
put his face in the paper.

27:28.480 --> 27:32.439
- Wouldn't you get in trouble for that?
- Well, we'll find out.

27:32.520 --> 27:36.308
You know what? Sometimes,
he is just... whoo!

27:37.520 --> 27:39.875
What?

27:39.960 --> 27:42.713
This is the pattern
of fractured osteons.

27:42.800 --> 27:46.952
- A blow from the front that grazed the skull.
- A bullet?

27:47.040 --> 27:50.635
There'd have been particulates left
by a bullet fired from short range.

27:50.720 --> 27:56.431
I isolated the most fractured
osteons and this pattern emerges.

27:56.520 --> 28:00.957
- It looks like the business end of a tyre iron.
- No, the size is wrong. It's too small.

28:01.040 --> 28:04.476
The weapon was actually chasing
the skull when it landed.

28:04.560 --> 28:10.874
I believe she was pulled away, so most of the
force was lost, leaving a slight impression.

28:10.960 --> 28:15.636
Bones. I got what I need from Witness
Protection. Let's go for a drive.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.830
Everybody.

28:20.920 --> 28:23.275
Thank you.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.351
I...

28:27.880 --> 28:29.871
Thank you.

28:41.840 --> 28:45.719
OK, Bones, just listen to me. This guy
McVicar, he might be a pig farmer now,

28:45.800 --> 28:51.272
but he used to be a mechanic with ties in the
strong-arm crew your parents ran away from.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.875
- A mechanic like Russ?
- Not like Russ. Russ fixes things.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.872
This guy, he used to kill people.

28:57.960 --> 29:01.839
- Can I help you, folks?
- Yeah. Put your hands up.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.273
<i>- Do it.
- Booth!</i>

29:03.360 --> 29:05.396
Check him for a gun.

29:06.280 --> 29:08.874
What's going on?

29:10.560 --> 29:13.199
- He's got a. 45.
- .45? Check his ankle.

29:16.160 --> 29:19.436
- He's got a. 38.
- .38. I'm always right.

29:19.520 --> 29:23.433
- I'm FBI. I know who you are.
- Steve Beers, pig farmer.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.637
Vince McVicar, the pig farmer, huh?

29:26.720 --> 29:30.349
You wanna talk to Vince McVicar, you
do it through the federaI marshals.

29:30.440 --> 29:34.319
Then I'd have to tell 'em about a pig
farmer who carries two concealed weapons.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.437
Three. .22 in the small of his back.

29:37.520 --> 29:39.795
- .22. I'm always right.
- No, you're not.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.553
I am. Bones, will you put the gun down?

29:43.920 --> 29:45.876
What do you want?

29:45.960 --> 29:48.554
I'm Ruth Keenan's daughter.

29:51.640 --> 29:53.631
Joy?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.755
You're Joy Keenan?

29:57.600 --> 29:59.556
Yeah.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.835
I can see that.

30:03.120 --> 30:07.557
- We found your blood in the car.
- You hurt people. You bashed in their heads.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.995
They never proved that,
or I wouldn't be here.

30:10.080 --> 30:12.071
We know how it works, Vince.

30:12.160 --> 30:15.550
You rat out your crew, everybody
loses interest in a few old murders.

30:15.640 --> 30:20.714
- My mother was hit on the head.
- Yeah, I know. I was there.

30:21.560 --> 30:24.438
- 32 stitches.
- She fought back, huh?

30:24.520 --> 30:27.114
Ruthie fought back, all right.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.913
- But not against me.
- Then against whom?

30:32.960 --> 30:34.951
Your father.

30:36.720 --> 30:38.711
Why did he attack you?

30:39.760 --> 30:44.629
- Think about it a second, all right?
- You and my... my mother?

30:44.720 --> 30:46.915
Me and Ruthie ran off together.

30:47.000 --> 30:51.710
Max caught us pulling into a moteI
outside of Champaign, Illinois.

30:51.800 --> 30:55.076
We were nuts about each
other, Ruthie and me.

30:55.160 --> 30:59.039
- Crazy in love.
- Let's just skip that part, OK?

31:02.920 --> 31:05.673
- He hit Ruthie first.
- With what?

31:05.760 --> 31:07.830
Tyre iron.

31:07.920 --> 31:11.799
Hit my arm, caught me a
roundhouse to the head.

31:11.880 --> 31:13.438
Lights out, baby.

31:14.480 --> 31:19.952
I came to, Ruthie and Max were
gone. Never saw neither of 'em again.

31:21.760 --> 31:25.958
If you ask me, Max killed Ruthie,
buried her somewhere and vanished.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.429
Our plan, once we set up,

31:29.960 --> 31:32.633
most likely in Florida,

31:32.720 --> 31:34.995
was to bring you down.

31:35.920 --> 31:38.195
Your father is a hard man, Joy.

31:38.280 --> 31:41.511
My name is Brennan. I'm Dr...

31:43.040 --> 31:45.634
I'm Dr Temperance Brennan.

31:48.120 --> 31:52.671
I work at the Jeffersonian Institution.
I'm a forensic anthropologist.

31:52.760 --> 31:55.035
I specialise in identif...

31:59.640 --> 32:01.631
in identifying...

32:02.720 --> 32:06.713
in identifying people who
nobody knows who they are.

32:06.800 --> 32:10.349
My father was a science teacher
and my mother was a book-keeper.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.271
My brother...

32:12.360 --> 32:14.351
I have a brother.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.710
I'm Dr Temperance Brennan.

32:17.800 --> 32:21.110
I know who you are.
Hey, I know. It's OK.

32:23.320 --> 32:25.709
Shh. It's gonna be all right.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.631
- No way Dad hits Mom. No way.
- If he caught them together...

32:30.720 --> 32:34.952
- No way Mom cheats on Dad. No way.
- McVicar lies the way you guys drink water.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.679
He killed people then he
snitched to save his own ass.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.069
- You don't believe him?
- No, I don't.

32:40.160 --> 32:43.038
Give me one piece of evidence
that doesn't back up his story.

32:43.120 --> 32:47.159
- Sticker on your parents' car was scraped off.
- What does that prove?

32:47.240 --> 32:50.596
The only reason to do that would
be to keep you guys hidden and safe.

32:50.680 --> 32:55.196
- From McVicar?
- He did hits for the crew that they ran out on.

32:55.280 --> 32:57.748
- What else?
- There's a story that tracks for me,

32:57.840 --> 33:01.355
but without evidence, it's just a story.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.158
Tell us.

33:05.520 --> 33:09.433
Your parents go out Christmas shopping,
they spot McVicar, the hit man.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.829
They lead him away from your home.

33:11.920 --> 33:15.356
Scrape off the name of the schooI
so he can't trace it to me and Russ.

33:15.440 --> 33:18.398
- He takes out your dad.
- And Mom gets away with a head wound?

33:18.480 --> 33:20.675
She leaves the car 1,000 miles away,

33:20.760 --> 33:25.276
but she can never go back to see you guys
because the crew is still looking for her.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.874
- It's just a story.
- Fits the evidence.

33:27.960 --> 33:30.269
The weapons that McVicar had on him,

33:30.360 --> 33:33.591
they're a violation of his
agreement with Witness Protection.

33:33.680 --> 33:37.116
I'm gonna take him into custody,
get a warrant, search his farm.

33:37.200 --> 33:39.998
- For what?
- McVicar liked to bash in people's heads.

33:40.080 --> 33:42.753
Maybe we'll get lucky and
match the weapon he used.

33:42.840 --> 33:46.753
- It's unlikely.
- In that case, we'll still ruin his day.

33:53.280 --> 33:59.276
Tempe, that theory explains why Mom
never came back for you before she died.

34:00.160 --> 34:03.835
- What's your excuse, Russ?
- You're the one that left me.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.639
You... you needed someone
to blame, you chose me.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.951
- I was 15 years old.
- I was 19!

34:10.040 --> 34:14.716
My parents were gone, my sister hated me.
Everyone's telling me she should be in care.

34:14.800 --> 34:18.588
- You didn't even ask me.
- I tried, Temperance. You wouldn't talk to me!

34:18.679 --> 34:22.434
You wouldn't be talking if Mom's bones
hadn't shown up. And I kept trying.

34:22.520 --> 34:25.556
Every year. Every year on your birthday.

34:25.639 --> 34:27.949
You're the one that gave up!

34:28.040 --> 34:33.034
You turned your back on me and
you made yourself a new family.

34:45.600 --> 34:47.158
What's going on?

34:47.239 --> 34:50.516
The FBI delivered these tools
and weapons from the pig farm guy.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.831
We went through them to see if any
matched the mark on your mom's skull.

34:53.920 --> 34:59.199
We got 20 hammers, a dozen hatchets.
Man loves his blunt instruments.

34:59.280 --> 35:04.354
Seven tyre irons. None of them match
the wound, even allowing for shrinkage.

35:04.440 --> 35:07.318
It was 15 years ago. Even
if McVicar killed my mother,

35:07.400 --> 35:10.915
what are the chances he
hung on to the exact weapon?

35:11.000 --> 35:13.639
It's always like this with McVicar.

35:13.720 --> 35:17.190
Some mook is found with his forehead
bashed in and the FBI goes in,

35:17.280 --> 35:21.114
collects about 40 hammers,
and nothing matches.

35:21.200 --> 35:24.112
- Always the forehead?
- That's his signature kill. Yeah.

35:24.200 --> 35:26.316
Not that anyone could ever prove it.

35:26.400 --> 35:30.029
You said guys like McVicar get
comfortable with a way of killing.

35:30.120 --> 35:32.315
- Yeah.
- Where did McVicar grow up?

35:32.400 --> 35:34.630
He grew up a farm kid in Iowa. Why?

35:34.720 --> 35:37.109
How do you slaughter a pig?

35:39.760 --> 35:43.036
- Why's he here?
- He gets nervous. We're getting close.

35:43.120 --> 35:45.111
Found this in the barn.

35:46.000 --> 35:48.434
This is a spring-loaded
captive bolt stunner.

35:48.520 --> 35:53.275
The animaI's restrained,
it's pressed to the forehead.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.270
Who could use this on a human being?

36:00.360 --> 36:02.635
Who could use this on a pig?

36:02.720 --> 36:06.474
It's the perfect dodge. Blood,
flesh can all be explained.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.199
- I think I just became a vegetarian.
- What do you think?

36:09.280 --> 36:14.991
Yeah. Same shape as a tyre iron,
but smaller. This could be a match.

36:15.080 --> 36:18.072
Before you decide
anything, we should talk.

36:19.840 --> 36:22.149
I'd call that nervous. Wouldn't you?

36:22.240 --> 36:27.155
There's no way to prove that's the weapon
that killed your mother or anyone else.

36:27.240 --> 36:29.629
You'd be surprised
at what she can prove.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.631
- I need to speak to you alone.
- Forget it.

36:31.720 --> 36:35.713
- Booth, it's all right. It's all right.
- No. No.

36:40.200 --> 36:43.829
You got two ways to look at this.
One is you score a private chat.

36:43.920 --> 36:47.310
Second is you attack her and I'll
drill you through the forehead.

36:47.400 --> 36:51.632
- How could I possibly attack her?
- I'll decide what is and isn't an attack,

36:51.720 --> 36:53.551
like, say, a hiccup.

36:53.640 --> 36:55.631
Booth. Come on.

37:01.240 --> 37:04.471
- You killed my mother.
- It would be hard to convince ajury.

37:04.560 --> 37:07.996
I'm pretty persuasive.
I'll put you away.

37:08.080 --> 37:10.389
Here's the thing, Joy.

37:10.480 --> 37:15.474
Two people know what really happened
that night. Me and your father.

37:15.560 --> 37:20.634
- You killed him before you attacked my mom.
- Then how did I get this scar on my head?

37:20.720 --> 37:23.359
You got a choice, Joy.

37:23.440 --> 37:26.989
Drop the bolt stunner down the
well and you'll know what happened.

37:27.080 --> 37:32.791
You put me in front of ajury, not
only will you faiI to convict, but...

37:32.880 --> 37:35.713
you'll never know the truth.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.628
You can't live with that, Joy.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.713
You can't live not knowing.

37:48.040 --> 37:53.478
I found out what happened to my mother.
I'll find out what happened to my father too.

37:53.560 --> 37:58.076
- We're done.
- You'll never know what happened your dad!

37:59.600 --> 38:05.470
- Why are you letting me drive?
- It's a reward for totally pissing off a hit man.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.994
- Oh, can I read your book?
- After it's come out.

38:09.080 --> 38:10.433
- Not before?
- No.

38:10.520 --> 38:12.636
What? I let you drive.

38:13.720 --> 38:16.154
- Just let it go.
- Where are we going?

38:16.240 --> 38:19.516
I'd like to make up
for a little lost time.

38:25.800 --> 38:28.837
I'm gonna go get a funneI cake, OK?

38:39.520 --> 38:41.715
I have something for you.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.031
Thanks, Tempe.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.991
Russ.

38:53.320 --> 38:55.311
You were right.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.798
You were only 19, but at the time...

39:00.840 --> 39:03.752
I didn't understand what that meant.

39:03.840 --> 39:08.436
Sometimes people need to
explain things to me, I guess.

39:09.320 --> 39:13.029
Then... you have to
let them talk to you.

39:15.760 --> 39:21.278
If you could maybe come back
and stay a couple of days longer?

39:21.360 --> 39:23.828
Please?

39:23.920 --> 39:26.514
At my place, I mean.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.391
Marco.

39:36.720 --> 39:38.711
Polo.

40:02.840 --> 40:05.832
- Anybody thirsty?
- Is it too early for a beer?

40:05.920 --> 40:09.435
I gotta go. I'm picking
up Parker for the weekend.

40:11.320 --> 40:13.515
I'll take one.

40:13.600 --> 40:16.194
- You have a boy?
- Yeah.

40:18.080 --> 40:21.959
The woman I'm seeing,
she's got two daughters.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.031
Nice.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.631
Girls are nice.

40:30.920 --> 40:32.751
- To us.
- Whoever the hell we are.

40:32.840 --> 40:34.637
To what we're becoming.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.993
<i>New message recorded today. 3pm.</i>

40:48.080 --> 40:51.959
<i>Temperance, you have to stop looking.</i>

40:52.040 --> 40:56.716
<i>Y ou have to stop looking for me right
now. This is bigger and worse than you know.</i>

40:56.800 --> 40:59.075
<i>Please. Stop now.</i>

40:59.160 --> 41:01.196
Who's that?

41:03.360 --> 41:05.874
That was my father.
