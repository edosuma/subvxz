01:02.062 --> 01:06.398
Last year, lakagigar last erupted
in 1783, ultimately killing

01:06.400 --> 01:09.268
Over 6 million people. The
ash cloud is beginning to

01:09.270 --> 01:11.904
Spread east toward the
uk and europe beyond...

01:20.747 --> 01:23.849
Are these figure just
preliminary?

01:23.851 --> 01:27.086
Yes, the eruption began
only 15 minutes ago.

01:27.088 --> 01:30.689
And yet, it's exactly as we
predicted.

01:30.691 --> 01:37.529
12 kilometer high plumes, 2000 tons of ash
per second, the multiple earthquakes.

01:37.531 --> 01:42.634
This is going to carry on for a few days,
we'd better start revising the model.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.870
We'll need data from the
other sites as well.

01:44.872 --> 01:50.542
Call the monitoring stations, I want
facts, before I call the authorities.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.411
You really think this is it?

01:52.413 --> 01:56.215
If the data holds to the
model, I think it is.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.526
Oh really? Again?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.294
What's up perkins?

02:09.295 --> 02:13.065
Isis erupted again. It's an
annual event, apparently.

02:13.067 --> 02:16.024
First it was ian, a year ago.
Then greenverner.

02:16.037 --> 02:19.004
And now lakagigar.

02:19.006 --> 02:23.142
Wonderful language skills you got there.
Be careful, you'll get a posting there.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.710
So how bad?

02:24.712 --> 02:26.712
Probably the strongest yet.

02:26.714 --> 02:30.349
It only happened about an hours ago, and
it had already reached 17 kilometers.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.891
17 kilometers? You know,
that is really bad.

02:32.904 --> 02:35.454
What's the spread?

02:35.456 --> 02:36.889
Winds aren't too strong.

02:36.891 --> 02:38.690
Alright keep me posted.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.650
Oh one moment. What's
happening with that

02:42.663 --> 02:45.364
little storm system in
the northwest atlantic?

02:45.366 --> 02:49.635
It's gathering strength.
Temperature is down 12 degrees.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.504
Pressure is down
by 240 milibars.

02:52.506 --> 02:55.607
If that crosses the ash cloud,
it would rather a mess.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.709
Yes it will.

02:57.711 --> 03:01.413
Alright, if there is even a possibility
of a major grounding, the sooner the

03:01.415 --> 03:04.283
People know the better.
Spread the good news.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.284
Will do cornel.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.090
Thank you control. This is 165
out.

03:12.392 --> 03:15.027
What was that all about? An ash
cloud?

03:15.562 --> 03:17.296
Not much I hope.

03:17.298 --> 03:22.334
Morava nb1765. Reduce altitude
<i>to 30,000 ft and report.</i>

03:22.336 --> 03:26.505
Roger that control. 1765,
reducing altitude.

03:29.242 --> 03:31.276
Ah, there it is. The coast.

03:32.879 --> 03:36.448
Ah, the septedial. This blessed
plot.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.616
What's that?

03:37.618 --> 03:39.451
Shakespeare darling.

03:39.453 --> 03:40.686
Oh, right of course.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.288
Lucky you are so handsome.

03:44.925 --> 03:47.092
Why are they having you reduce
altitude?

03:47.094 --> 03:50.062
Oh, I'm sure it's just
an air traffic issue.

03:50.064 --> 03:53.699
Control, this is 1765.
We are at 30,000 feet.

03:53.701 --> 03:57.603
<i>Roger, 1765. Stand by for
further instructions.</i>

03:57.605 --> 03:59.871
Roger that.

03:59.873 --> 04:01.762
Four years ago my team
built a model predicting

04:01.775 --> 04:03.675
icelandic volcanic
activity and this

04:03.677 --> 04:08.614
Morning's eruption hews almost exactly to
the parameters established in that model.

04:08.616 --> 04:13.952
The amount of ash and lava,
the 5.5 magnitude earthquake.

04:13.954 --> 04:18.824
Consequently, we believe the second
phase we predicted will shortly begin.

04:18.826 --> 04:23.729
A series of linked eruptions throughout
northern and central europe.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.031
Oh god.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.899
What we are going to see is the seismic
activity of one volcano triggering the next

04:27.901 --> 04:30.569
Along the fault lines at the
edge of the tectonic plate.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.372
I've never heard of such a thing. -You
cant be serious. -No no no no no no

04:33.374 --> 04:40.412
Germany, Italy, France,
greece...

04:40.414 --> 04:43.115
It could be a matter
of days, if not hours.

04:43.117 --> 04:47.786
Oh my oh no, dr. This is a
complete disaster, this can't be.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.688
A disaster of this nature.
Your figures must be mistaken.

04:49.690 --> 04:54.593
Please, please no one wants to
cause a panic, but you should

04:54.595 --> 04:58.897
Begin making arrangements to move
people from the affected areas.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.668
And what exactly are the
affected areas?

05:02.670 --> 05:08.040
Approximately 83% of
the european landmass.

05:08.042 --> 05:12.611
You ok right? I mean this isn't
a 747, champagne, caviar, and

05:12.613 --> 05:14.179
All that fancy stuff.

05:14.181 --> 05:17.582
No, this is fun. It's romantic.
Just the two of us.

05:17.584 --> 05:20.652
Well my ex didn't like
flying in small planes.

05:20.654 --> 05:25.190
Her loss. What about you?

05:25.192 --> 05:27.025
Not wishing this was a fighter
jet?

05:27.027 --> 05:30.696
I'll let you know young lady.
I've flew e-3's.

05:30.698 --> 05:35.867
Right. You know what I meant. You
sure you don't miss the air force?

05:35.869 --> 05:38.970
I don't miss the air force. I've had
enough danger for one lifetime now.

05:38.972 --> 05:43.141
Now it's just quality time. Quality
romantic time with my new beautiful wife.

05:43.143 --> 05:48.280
you're sweet. But you don't
have to keep selling. I'm already here.

05:48.282 --> 05:52.884
I'm not selling. I just find
it unbelievable sometimes.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.788
kids are going to love you.

05:56.790 --> 05:57.723
Maybe.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.257
They will.

05:59.259 --> 06:00.759
Well, I won't take it personally
if they are resentful.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.628
1765, you're on route
to paris <i>le bourget.</i>

06:03.630 --> 06:05.997
Roger that control.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.033
<i>I'm afraid all non-emergency air traffic
is being grounded immediately due to</i>

06:08.035 --> 06:12.304
Atmospheric conditions. You'll
<i>have to land at london city.</i>

06:12.306 --> 06:14.773
Control. We can be in paris
is less then an hour.

06:14.775 --> 06:19.511
That's a negative 1765, reduce
<i>altitude to 25,000 feet and report.</i>

06:19.513 --> 06:23.148
Roger that control.
1765 reducing altitude.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.883
I don't see any clouds.

06:25.752 --> 06:28.186
It must be coming in faster then
expected.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.656
Our temperature is dropping.
Look at the outometer

06:32.392 --> 06:35.093
There is a barometric
abnormality.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.929
May be it's just as well we are
landing.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.498
You think the kids are going to
be ok?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.800
They'll be fine. This must
be all over the news.

06:41.802 --> 06:43.368
Still you should check in.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.138
I'll give them a call when we
land.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.513
I wonder when that could
is going to reach us.

06:54.515 --> 06:58.316
Hopefully not until dad and
what's her name get here.

06:58.318 --> 06:59.584
Lacey?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.453
Whatever.

07:01.455 --> 07:07.225
Ok, so we have 4, we have 5 stops
until we get to gala dulles.

07:07.727 --> 07:09.728
No we got to take a bus to the
airport?

07:11.297 --> 07:13.965
Or should we just take a train?

07:15.001 --> 07:16.268
Ryan?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.805
Hello? Ryan?

07:19.807 --> 07:21.740
It's like the freakin' end of
the world coming. Can you stop

07:21.742 --> 07:23.975
Being a perve long
enough to pay attention.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.511
There is nothing perverted about
admiring a beautiful woman.

07:26.513 --> 07:29.815
It is when you do it to every
single woman that walks by.

07:29.817 --> 07:31.983
It's paris. You know?

07:31.985 --> 07:35.687
The whole reason I'm going to grad school
here is to experience another culture.

07:35.689 --> 07:40.792
Right. And I thought cause every
single woman in america shot you down.

07:42.729 --> 07:44.351
Anyway, it's probably not
the end of the world.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.997
Just an ash cloud.

07:45.999 --> 07:51.403
It's like that ia-ge-fur... Whatever how
you pronounce it, went off years back

07:51.405 --> 07:53.472
They just cancelled flights
and that was the end of it.

07:53.474 --> 07:56.608
Do you think it's going
to affect dad's flight?

07:56.610 --> 07:58.076
Let's hope not.

08:00.913 --> 08:04.883
Man, you know, I really have to
visit that thing before I graduate.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.652
What? You haven't been
to the eiffel tower?

08:07.654 --> 08:11.523
Oh my god, ryan what is wrong
with you?

08:11.525 --> 08:12.757
Such a loser.

08:13.693 --> 08:16.094
You know tyran, you might
consider being nicer to me.

08:16.096 --> 08:17.535
You really think that
mom and dad would have

08:17.548 --> 08:18.997
let you transfer to
the parson's program

08:18.999 --> 08:21.099
If I wasn't already here in
paris?

08:21.101 --> 08:22.534
Their little girl.

08:22.536 --> 08:25.237
awll awone
in a fowegn country.

08:25.239 --> 08:27.672
No way. Especially with your
history.

08:27.674 --> 08:33.879
I don't need a baby sitter. I'm fine.
In fact, I'm doing great.

08:34.145 --> 08:35.714
So glad to hear it.

08:36.115 --> 08:39.417
That's why I want to get to the airport.
Not on time but early.

08:39.719 --> 08:43.077
I want dad to see that I'm not
this little girl no more.

08:43.090 --> 08:46.458
And this semester
has matured me.

08:46.460 --> 08:48.827
So he'll pony up for the summer
session?

08:48.829 --> 08:54.065
I just want him to be proud of me.
Even though he is midlife crisising.

08:54.067 --> 08:54.866
Agh, tyran?

08:54.868 --> 08:56.968
What?

08:56.970 --> 08:59.671
The ink is not even dry on the divorce and
he runs off to marry some random chick.

08:59.673 --> 09:02.340
Mom left him. What do you want him to do?
Sit around crying

09:02.342 --> 09:05.210
Around and apologizing for
the rest of his life?

09:05.212 --> 09:07.012
Yeah. Sounds about right.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.714
How many times did mom
spend crying and alone.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.983
The guy is a pilot, of course
he's going to have to...

09:11.985 --> 09:13.908
You know what? We're not doing this.
You and

09:13.921 --> 09:15.854
I are not having our
own little version

09:15.856 --> 09:18.290
Of the same fight mom and
dad had for 20 years.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.725
They divorced. Dad remarried.

09:20.727 --> 09:24.563
Yeah. Some chick he knew 5 minutes.
Who's my age. That's gross.

09:24.830 --> 09:27.732
She's older.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.000
Still.

09:29.002 --> 09:32.938
Well, we are still doing alright on time.
They probably haven't hit England yet.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.874
Alright, I just don't
wanna take any chances.

09:36.275 --> 09:38.610
You know how dad is about
punctuality.

09:38.612 --> 09:43.281
If we're late we're grounded ...
For life.

09:44.350 --> 09:47.719
Control. This is 1765.
We're at 20,000 feet.

09:47.721 --> 09:52.791
Roger 1765, switch to
119.725 <i>for london city.</i>

09:52.793 --> 09:54.960
Roger that control.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.262
<i>Good luck 765.</i>

09:57.264 --> 10:00.332
Thank you control. This is 1765.
Out.

10:30.997 --> 10:34.899
Incredibly, reports are coming
in of yet another eruption of

10:34.901 --> 10:36.401
The european continent,

10:43.276 --> 10:46.011
Breaking news from europe. The
4th volcanic eruption has

10:46.013 --> 10:48.380
Shooken up the greek island
of santorini.

10:48.382 --> 10:50.015
Long thought to be inactive,
today's

10:50.017 --> 10:52.517
Explosion was accompanied
by violent earthquakes and

10:52.519 --> 10:56.287
Voluminous ash which, due to the
mountain's great elevation, is

11:14.074 --> 11:18.777
Already over 30,000 feet high and spreading
more than twenty miles to the northeast.

11:18.779 --> 11:23.214
...Terrorized and ruins, with more then
3,000 appear dead. Haven been caught...

11:38.198 --> 11:42.967
Volcanic ash. Formed some 300,000
years ago by what scientist call...

11:42.969 --> 11:47.305
Come populated but as the ash
clouds from multiple eruptions...

11:52.012 --> 11:55.019
There is already over a billion
tons of magma ejected.

11:55.032 --> 11:58.049
Two billion tons of ash.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.051
That's within parameters.

12:00.053 --> 12:03.488
But the sulpher dioxide, more than
two billion tons so far and already

12:03.490 --> 12:06.391
A 7 percent drop
in temperature.

12:06.393 --> 12:11.863
Don't you see what's happening here?
We have to revise the model.

12:16.035 --> 12:20.705
There's thirty three percent more ash
in the atmosphere than our model

12:20.707 --> 12:23.475
Predicted and it's spreading
faster than predicted as well.

12:23.477 --> 12:27.812
We're revising our projections as
we speak, but it is essential,

12:27.814 --> 12:30.448
For you to prepare for the new
reality.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.751
Which is what exactly?

12:32.753 --> 12:34.725
That temperatures will
also drop faster than

12:34.738 --> 12:36.721
predicted, it's going
to get very cold, very

12:36.723 --> 12:39.224
Quickly. In about 20 minutes,
I'll have the exact-

12:39.226 --> 12:42.293
You've already been mistaken doctor,
how do we know you're correct now?

12:42.295 --> 12:46.197
New data is just coming in as
we speak, but I don't think you

12:46.199 --> 12:49.868
Should wait for the revised
model to take action.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.302
I dunno. Geez...

12:51.304 --> 12:53.905
We'll have to get back to you
doctor.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.242
Thank you sir.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.277
Ana!

12:59.279 --> 13:01.212
Yes doctor.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.948
Get me colonel dillard at the
geilenkirchen airbase, will you?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.650
Right away.

13:06.552 --> 13:11.589
London. City control. This is aravanb 1765.
We're on scheduled landing.

13:11.591 --> 13:17.929
<i>We've got you 765. Make your heading 122.5
degrees, reduce altitude to 12,000 feet.</i>

13:17.931 --> 13:21.733
Roger that control. I'm sure they
are going to be late anyway.

13:21.735 --> 13:24.836
Tyran probably got side tracked
by a couple fancy boutiques.

13:24.838 --> 13:27.505
You know you should go easy on her.
She's in a tough age.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.441
she's always at a tough age.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.744
Girls. We're complicated.

13:32.746 --> 13:35.713
What I'm paying for that school.

13:35.715 --> 13:37.515
Jesus! Look at that thing.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.985
Oh. Maybe that's a good
thing we're landing.

13:40.987 --> 13:43.488
But then how are we going to get
to paris?

13:43.490 --> 13:46.291
One crisis at a time.

13:46.293 --> 13:54.299
London control. This is 1765.
We're at 12,000 feet.

13:54.301 --> 13:59.270
Yes I'll be on my way colonel and I
will explain more in detail when I

13:59.272 --> 14:02.807
Arrive at the base but in the meantime
I don't think we can afford to

14:02.809 --> 14:05.710
Wait for the authorities to take
action.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.279
Doctor, I do not understand.

14:08.281 --> 14:13.384
The multiple eruptions and earthquakes are
linked colonel, there's far more magma,

14:13.386 --> 14:16.020
Ash and sulpher dioxide being
released than predicted.

14:16.022 --> 14:21.793
The result is something, something
we've never seen before.

14:21.795 --> 14:24.996
The model I sent you should help
explain it, do you have it open?

14:24.998 --> 14:27.398
Yes, yes I've got the model
open.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.535
Then you should be able to see
the fault lines, which exist

14:30.537 --> 14:33.338
Along the edges of
the tectonic plate.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.139
Okay

14:35.141 --> 14:38.877
Would you please get me a warmer
jacket and a clean shirt?

14:38.879 --> 14:41.746
Sorry about that colonel, as I
was saying.

14:41.748 --> 14:44.382
Do you mind if I put you on
speakerphone for a moment?

14:44.384 --> 14:47.185
Of course not.

14:47.187 --> 14:50.455
As I was saying it was a massive
tectonic shift in the mid atlantic

14:50.457 --> 14:53.591
Rift under iceland that caused
a chain reaction earthquakes

14:53.593 --> 14:55.593
And volcanic eruptions
across the continent.

14:55.595 --> 14:58.930
But currently, the ash clouds
from these separate eruptions

14:58.932 --> 15:01.266
Are merging and spreading as
one through the atmosphere.

15:01.268 --> 15:06.404
And because the cloud are blocking out
the sun, temperatures are falling.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.172
Yes, but...

15:08.174 --> 15:11.643
Due to the pre-existing storm
system in the north atlantic,

15:11.645 --> 15:13.912
The glacial melt has
increased exponentially.

15:15.047 --> 15:17.587
Look, how can that be?
Temperatures falling?

15:17.600 --> 15:20.151
Glaciers melting?

15:20.153 --> 15:22.720
Surely that means temperatures
are rising.

15:22.722 --> 15:26.758
No, because the chemical make up of
volcanic debris sends increased sulfide

15:26.760 --> 15:31.562
Levels into the atmosphere,
thus increasing precipitation.

15:31.564 --> 15:36.634
Alright, alright. How long is it going
to take before this cloud dissipates?

15:36.636 --> 15:40.471
Click the blue tab on the model,
will you?

15:40.473 --> 15:43.808
Well the cloud is projected to block
the sun for the next eighteen to

15:43.810 --> 15:46.511
Twenty four months at least.
And all that time,

15:46.513 --> 15:51.950
Temperatures will continue to plummet.
Is it snowing there yet?

15:51.952 --> 15:53.217
What?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.020
No. No no it's not.

15:56.022 --> 15:58.856
Good, it's only a matter of
time.

15:58.858 --> 16:03.761
Doctor, how much snow are
we talking about here?

16:03.763 --> 16:08.633
Given the enormous amount of
moisture rising into the atmosphere.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.602
Look, we're still working
on the model for that.

16:11.604 --> 16:14.172
It should be ready by the time I
reach the base, will that do?

16:14.174 --> 16:20.111
Yes of course. Wait one moment doctor.
Let me quite clear about this.

16:20.113 --> 16:27.051
What you're saying is that this storm
will persist in a matter of years.

16:27.053 --> 16:32.357
What is going to happen to europe? I mean,
how much of europe will remain habitable?

16:32.359 --> 16:35.499
I don't wish to engage
in hyperbole colonel.

16:35.512 --> 16:38.663
I'm receiving new
data just right now.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.932
I'll really have to
get back to you.

16:43.702 --> 16:48.139
Have we heard from headquarters
lately?

16:48.141 --> 16:51.109
I think we should give them a
little call.

16:51.111 --> 16:54.885
And um, I'd like to review
the emergency protocols.

16:54.898 --> 16:58.683
If this thing is going
to go pear shaped

16:58.685 --> 17:00.284
I think we awt to be prepared.

17:01.120 --> 17:02.687
See to it.

17:07.326 --> 17:11.095
...The tectonic shifts causing earthquakes
and volcanic eruptions in iceland

17:11.097 --> 17:13.364
And the european
continent are also

17:13.366 --> 17:17.667
Affecting the arctic circle. Scientists
in murmansk report glacial breaks as

17:17.670 --> 17:19.871
Long as ten kilometers,
while experts from

17:19.873 --> 17:24.409
The byrd polar research center estimate
the rise in sea level from rapidly

17:24.411 --> 17:29.580
Melting polar ice will flood coastal
cities in scandinavia and beyond.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.917
Residents of those areas are advised
to move inland as quickly as possible

17:32.919 --> 17:36.954
To ensure their own safety. To allow
government officials to make preparations

17:36.956 --> 17:39.090
Against this global phenomenon.

17:44.596 --> 17:51.536
London city airport will be closed in
forty-five minutes, all personnel should

17:51.538 --> 17:53.971
Whoo, it's cold as hell out there.
We didn't pack for this weather.

17:54.306 --> 17:56.629
There's no signal. We could
try the staffline phone.

17:56.642 --> 17:58.976
We should call the kids.

17:58.978 --> 18:02.046
Well, why don't we wait and
figure out a game plan here.

18:02.048 --> 18:05.149
Why don't you call the?

18:05.151 --> 18:06.617
Ok.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.121
It got a little nippy huh?

18:10.123 --> 18:12.323
Yeah, it'll be warm in the
metro.

18:14.394 --> 18:15.726
Oh my god it's dad!

18:15.728 --> 18:17.628
He must be calling from the
plane.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.064
Hi dad, hey look we're just
getting the metro right now, soo.

18:20.066 --> 18:24.001
Hey ryan hold on a second. Listen, we won't
be landing in le bourse, we had to land in

18:24.003 --> 18:27.071
London because the ash cloud.
Has it gotten there yet?

18:27.073 --> 18:30.030
No, it's not but it's coming.
It's cold and

18:30.043 --> 18:33.010
dark in the middle of the
day, are you guys ok?

18:33.012 --> 18:35.513
Yeah we're fine. How are you guys doing?
How's tyran?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.315
She's great, wanna say hi?

18:37.317 --> 18:38.916
Hey dad.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.085
Hello taryn. Would you put
me on the speakerphone hun.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.287
Ok.

18:43.289 --> 18:45.011
Listen guys, we are going
to be grounded here in

18:45.024 --> 18:46.757
london for a few days
because of the weather.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.182
So why don't you hold
up in the apartment and

18:49.195 --> 18:51.629
after it clears up we'll reconnect.
How is that?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.097
Ok.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.866
Ok yeah, sounds good. Hey
tell lacey we say hi!

18:54.868 --> 18:56.467
Oh hi guys, can't wait to meet
you.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.035
Us too, us too.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.637
Alright guys we'll talk in a
couple days.

18:59.639 --> 19:00.338
Bye

19:00.340 --> 19:02.507
Bye.

19:02.509 --> 19:03.641
Awe he's so sweet.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.542
Yeah.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.776
Kiss ass.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.245
What?

19:07.247 --> 19:08.379
You're a kiss ass.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.413
"kiss-ass"? I'm just trying to
be nice.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.453
So what's the plan?

19:15.455 --> 19:18.789
The plan is to get a nice hotel room
and start our honeymoon right now.

19:18.791 --> 19:22.393
You know if the planes are going to be
grounded, the roads and the trains are

19:22.395 --> 19:26.797
Going to be packed. Maybe we
should head to paris right now.

19:27.399 --> 19:28.132
Right now?

19:28.134 --> 19:28.633
Yeah.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.634
Right now?

19:29.636 --> 19:31.569
Mmhmm.

19:31.571 --> 19:33.604
Good idea.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.040
Ok, I'll go rent us a car and you
book us a ticket on the eurostar.

19:36.042 --> 19:39.877
Sounds good. May be on the way there we can
get some winter gear for us and the kids.

19:39.879 --> 19:40.845
That's a good idea.

19:40.847 --> 19:41.846
Yeah.

19:41.848 --> 19:44.982
Let's go to the market before
we go home, if there's a

19:44.984 --> 19:47.185
Storm coming, it'll be good to
stock up.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.252
Sure.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.255
Taryn.

19:54.493 --> 19:57.395
I guess that's the ash cloud.

19:57.397 --> 20:00.398
I guess it is.

20:00.400 --> 20:04.669
Whoo, did you feel that,
it just got really cold.

20:04.671 --> 20:07.538
Yeah weird, let's get going.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.806
yeah

20:17.817 --> 20:19.850
Cmon! Cmon!

20:25.524 --> 20:27.124
Oh god, ryan!

20:28.627 --> 20:30.094
Ryan, ryan are you ok?!

20:30.096 --> 20:33.364
I think so, nice going t.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.170
Soccer kicks footballs ass.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.707
Ok cmon, it's not safe.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.976
Cmon, we gotta get outa here.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.515
Any luck?

20:51.517 --> 20:54.885
No but I've gotten to hear "do you really
wanna hurt me" eighty seven times.

20:56.456 --> 20:59.156
I will never look at boy
george the same way again.

20:59.825 --> 21:02.693
This weather's a mess, why don't we just
get a motel for the night and we'll

21:02.695 --> 21:04.595
Get an early start
in the morning?

21:04.597 --> 21:07.732
Steve, why is it me that's
pushing you to see your kids?

21:07.734 --> 21:08.833
What?

21:08.835 --> 21:11.168
Shouldn't this be all your idea?

21:11.170 --> 21:15.640
Well, I guess it should be. I guess I have
to get used to thinking like a good parent.

21:15.642 --> 21:17.908
Mhm

21:17.910 --> 21:20.244
It'll be a little difficult considering I
was always told I was such a bad husband...

21:20.246 --> 21:23.180
Well...It takes two to
make a marriage work.

21:23.182 --> 21:23.714
It does...

21:23.716 --> 21:25.316
Or not work.

21:26.084 --> 21:29.387
Listen I love you, and I
know you're a good man.

21:29.389 --> 21:29.720
Thank you honey.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.260
God, I can't believe it's
snowing.

21:37.529 --> 21:39.797
Check the radio, see what's
going on.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.699
Ok.

21:41.701 --> 21:44.368
Potentially the worst snow storms
since 1908, when more than

21:44.370 --> 21:47.705
26 inches fell over three days in April.
Currently in

21:47.707 --> 21:52.043
London the temperature is below zero and
dropping steadily. Dozens of cities

21:52.045 --> 21:55.980
Around the nation are without power,
but we will continue to broadcast

21:55.982 --> 21:57.581
As long as are able.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.519
This can't be right.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.621
How certain are you?

22:03.623 --> 22:06.057
The projection is based on
current data.

22:06.059 --> 22:10.067
16 inches of ash will cover europe?
The sun

22:10.080 --> 22:14.098
will be blocked out by
this cloud for 2 years.

22:14.100 --> 22:18.436
Earthquakes, after shocks. Temperatures
will fall below zero and remain there.

22:18.438 --> 22:27.078
And snow will continue to fall more or
less continuously for the next 22 months.

22:27.080 --> 22:31.782
My god man. This is an
unmanageable catastrophe.

22:31.784 --> 22:38.656
Well it's a situation colonel, like I said,
I don't like to engage in hyperbole.

22:38.658 --> 22:42.093
Hyperbole! Hyperbole!

22:42.095 --> 22:43.951
Good god man if these
projections are correct.

22:43.964 --> 22:45.830
Europe on the large
portion of the

22:45.832 --> 22:50.468
Northern hemisphere, have just
entered into a new ice age.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.842
At least the hail stopped. Do you want
to head home or go to the market?

22:57.844 --> 23:00.133
Let's do both. Let's go
get some boat , jackets.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.446
Let's stock up on food
and water and hold

23:02.448 --> 23:04.181
Up in the flat like dad said,
ok?

23:04.183 --> 23:11.455
Ok. Sounds like a plan.

23:11.457 --> 23:14.024
Ryan, what are you doing,
you're such a cluts.

23:14.026 --> 23:16.594
I didn't anything. You
think it's the metro?

23:16.596 --> 23:17.561
Look.

23:38.317 --> 23:39.850
help me!

23:39.852 --> 23:41.051
Earthquake!

23:41.686 --> 23:42.453
Ryan!

23:58.371 --> 23:59.036
What?

23:59.038 --> 24:00.004
Come with me.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.739
No no no it's fine.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.174
Come with me.

24:03.176 --> 24:05.309
No no no. My brother. Ryan!

24:06.946 --> 24:08.212
My brother is there.

24:08.214 --> 24:11.081
He's probably dead. I can save
you.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.183
Let me go!

24:12.185 --> 24:13.751
You are panicking. Come with me.

24:13.753 --> 24:14.618
Let me go!

24:14.620 --> 24:15.553
Come on.

24:15.555 --> 24:16.787
Ok. If you insist.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.155
ooww!

24:18.157 --> 24:19.557
Asshole.

24:21.059 --> 24:22.526
Ryan!

24:27.332 --> 24:29.166
Ryan! Are you ok?

24:31.203 --> 24:33.103
Taryn? You ok?

24:33.105 --> 24:34.738
I asked you first.

24:35.273 --> 24:38.642
Ah! It sucked. I think I hit my
head.

24:39.377 --> 24:41.400
I got hit on by some
crazy french guy in the

24:41.413 --> 24:43.447
middle of this earthquake.
Whatever it is.

24:43.449 --> 24:47.384
another earthquake.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.458
We got to get outta here.

24:54.460 --> 24:55.759
Let's go.

25:04.035 --> 25:07.538
Do you think the earthquakes are related
to the ash cloud? Or the volcanoes?

25:07.540 --> 25:09.440
I don't know. We should keep
moving.

25:09.442 --> 25:11.308
Where are we going to go?

25:11.310 --> 25:13.210
I don't know. The embassy?
They've got to have some kind of

25:13.212 --> 25:15.079
Emergency plan to protect
american citizens.

25:15.081 --> 25:17.481
It's so cold.

25:17.483 --> 25:21.118
What are we gonna do? Ryan I'm scared.
I'm really scared.

25:21.120 --> 25:22.920
Be scared later.

25:28.227 --> 25:30.261
Taryn! Taryn!

25:32.964 --> 25:36.433
Go! Go! Go! Go!

25:45.977 --> 25:47.545
You think it's over?

25:47.547 --> 25:53.584
I don't know it fells like
it's just the beginning.

25:53.586 --> 25:56.854
Oh man, look at that. Totally
smashed.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.724
Do your phone work?

26:03.128 --> 26:04.528
There's no signal.

26:04.996 --> 26:06.230
Maybe at the embassy?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.332
Let go to place de la concorde.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.935
at least the
earthquake has stopped.

26:11.303 --> 26:12.403
For now.

26:12.405 --> 26:13.571
Come on, let's go.

26:13.573 --> 26:18.576
Preliminary reports put the temblor
at 8.4 on the richter scale.

26:18.578 --> 26:21.579
Hospitals are overwhelmed with
with wounded, and thousands

26:21.581 --> 26:24.515
Are still unaccounted for in
the sudden wreckage littering

26:24.517 --> 26:27.785
Paris. While the city has
seen minor earthquakes in its

26:27.787 --> 26:31.722
History, never has there been
anything of this severity. Even

26:31.724 --> 26:36.327
The italian quake of 1908
was only 7.5 magnitude...

26:37.128 --> 26:38.228
Ok im calling the kids again.

26:38.230 --> 26:39.997
No, no I've got another idea.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.199
Ok who are we calling?

26:42.201 --> 26:45.336
Colonel ralph dillard, we served together
in desert storm. He's with nato now

26:45.338 --> 26:49.106
But he's commander of geilenkirchen,
he'll know what's going on.

26:49.909 --> 26:50.975
Hello.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.043
Ralph, steve foster here.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.879
Steve. This is not a good
time to talk I'm afraid.

26:55.881 --> 26:59.183
No I understand that sir, I'm in
England and my kids are in paris.

26:59.185 --> 27:01.852
Paris? Have you spoken to them?

27:01.854 --> 27:05.122
Yeah about three hours ago but
not since the earthquake sir.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.257
My dear fellow I'm so sorry.

27:07.259 --> 27:10.794
No no no that's alright they're smart
kids they're probably alright I'm sure.

27:10.796 --> 27:15.532
Oh yes of course. I didn't mean
... Oh

27:15.534 --> 27:17.267
We're heading to paris right
now.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.936
How are you getting there?

27:18.938 --> 27:21.038
We're going to the euro tunnel
to put the car on the train.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.072
Have you made a booking?

27:22.074 --> 27:23.741
No we can't get through.

27:23.743 --> 27:26.443
Alright, I may be able to help you there.
What's your eta?

27:26.445 --> 27:29.213
Little over an hour or so depending
on the weather and traffic.

27:29.215 --> 27:33.851
Alright. I'm in germany but I got
a friend of mine in truckston.

27:33.853 --> 27:34.785
Thanks ralph.

27:34.787 --> 27:35.953
What about the kids?

27:35.955 --> 27:37.655
What's that?

27:37.657 --> 27:40.190
The kids, we haven't spoken with
'em since before the earthquake.

27:40.192 --> 27:44.061
They don't know we're coming, and
we don't know where they're at.

27:44.063 --> 27:49.700
Well the good news is the mobile system in
paris is still working. It's crowded but

27:49.702 --> 27:52.936
Keep trying and you may get
through.

27:52.938 --> 27:55.305
What's the bad news, more
earthquakes?

27:55.307 --> 27:57.274
The earthquakes are the
least of our problems.

27:57.276 --> 27:59.410
Then what's the bigger problem?

27:59.412 --> 28:05.549
Look, steve. This ash cloud combined with
a freak storm and some circumstances

28:05.551 --> 28:10.754
That I don't fully understand.
Anyway the long story short ... The

28:10.756 --> 28:15.726
Cold is going to get colder. And
the snow is going to get deeper.

28:15.728 --> 28:19.096
Tell me there's a way
out of this, colonel.

28:19.098 --> 28:25.169
Steve. Europe is finished. This
is a global crisis. Now think

28:25.171 --> 28:29.339
Back to your emergency protocols.
They are executing

28:29.341 --> 28:32.015
Operation, down under..
We are going to

28:32.028 --> 28:34.712
evacuate all plato
personal & their families

28:34.714 --> 28:41.051
To australia. I will have c-160's leaving
every 2 hours for the next 10 hours.

28:41.053 --> 28:45.989
If you can get here, I premises you, I
will have a place for you on those planes.

28:45.991 --> 28:48.959
Colonel I don't know if I can
get to germany in 10 hours, it

28:48.961 --> 28:51.428
Might take me that long
just to get to paris.

28:54.566 --> 28:55.632
How about evreux??

28:55.634 --> 28:57.301
That's a good possibility.

28:57.303 --> 29:01.371
If you can get over there I'll
get a mi8 pick you up there. Go

29:01.373 --> 29:04.141
By paris and bring
you here, alright.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.176
I'll do my best.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.217
Well you got 10 hours to
find them and get you.

29:08.230 --> 29:10.280
After that I can't help.

29:10.282 --> 29:14.918
Now listen steve, I owe you big. This
is the best I can do. I've got an

29:14.920 --> 29:17.054
Awful lot on my
plate at the moment.

29:17.056 --> 29:22.760
No I understand colonel, when I see
you in 10 hours, we'll be even.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.129
Well, I look forward to see you.
Good bless.

29:25.131 --> 29:30.100
Thank you colonel, out.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.870
What exactly did you do for him?

29:32.872 --> 29:35.839
Nothin' he wouldn't have done
for me.

29:35.841 --> 29:37.307
Where's evreux?

29:37.309 --> 29:40.744
It's an air force base about 65
miles north of paris. And I'll

29:40.746 --> 29:42.880
Tell ya, that's a
lucky break for us.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.715
Well considering.

29:44.717 --> 29:50.053
Speaking of lucky breaks, just a couple
of miles to go to the euro tunnel.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.891
Ok I'm calling the kids again.

29:57.163 --> 29:58.762
Damn.

30:03.702 --> 30:07.638
Oh no. It's too late. It's
already been abandoned.

30:09.140 --> 30:10.207
Maybe not.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.608
Let's check around back.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.014
See. Somebody must still be
here.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.082
I don't know. It look pretty
dead to me.

30:19.084 --> 30:22.219
Ok. Worse case scenario.. It's
warmer in there then it is out here.

30:22.221 --> 30:25.122
Maybe there's supplies. A working phone.
If all that

30:25.124 --> 30:28.358
Fails we climb to the
top and use your phone.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.294
Ok, for the record ...

30:30.296 --> 30:32.129
Duly noted. C'mon.

30:34.866 --> 30:36.700
Hello.

30:36.702 --> 30:37.868
Hello.

30:37.870 --> 30:40.437
We're americans. We need help.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.806
Which way?

30:42.808 --> 30:45.275
I don't know.

30:45.476 --> 30:47.144
That way?

30:47.146 --> 30:48.579
No.

30:48.581 --> 30:49.780
Ok, how about that way?

30:49.782 --> 30:51.315
No.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.549
Ok, that way?

30:53.785 --> 30:54.251
No.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.353
Taryn?

30:56.355 --> 31:00.357
What? It's dirty. It's creepy. It looks
like it's going to fall apart any second.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.258
Look at the bright side.

31:01.260 --> 31:03.060
What bright side?

31:04.329 --> 31:05.963
Let's just go that way.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.801
Hello.

31:10.803 --> 31:12.102
Hello.

31:16.641 --> 31:18.542
At least they have power.
Look at the lights.

31:18.544 --> 31:21.511
Yeah sure. This isn't creepy at
all.

31:21.513 --> 31:27.451
All we need is a scratching sound and
a little girl in the corner singing

31:27.453 --> 31:32.522
♪ ring around the rosie

31:33.626 --> 31:35.058
Ryan! Where are you?

31:35.060 --> 31:36.960
Taryn! Taryn! Call down I'm
right here.

31:37.662 --> 31:41.164
There's a light at the end of the hallway.
They must have emergency power.

31:41.166 --> 31:42.566
Let's go check it out.

31:52.377 --> 31:54.945
Oh god what a mess.

32:00.685 --> 32:02.819
It's dead. What are you doing?

32:03.087 --> 32:06.490
Looking for something useful. Maybe someone
left a hat or a jacket, or something.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.593
Let's head up to the room. Maybe
your cellphone will get a signal.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.461
You crazy. I'm not going up to
the roof.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.399
We are just looking for ...
You are an american.

32:15.401 --> 32:17.634
Who are you?

32:17.636 --> 32:20.237
I'm ryan foster, this my sister taryn, her
dad is major steve foster. Us air force.

32:20.239 --> 32:22.195
But we can't get a hold of him,
and our house got destroyed.

32:22.208 --> 32:24.174
And we're freezing
and we figured

32:24.176 --> 32:26.677
The best place would be the us
embassy.

32:26.679 --> 32:28.718
Yeah sorry to let you
down but this place has

32:28.731 --> 32:30.781
been red tagged. Everyone
left 15 minutes ago.

32:30.783 --> 32:33.016
We set up a red cross
station at the louvre.

32:33.018 --> 32:37.220
I don't even know how you guys got in here.
Probably the security left with them too,

32:37.222 --> 32:39.556
Crap. I got to get outta here
and you too it's not safe here.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.859
No no no, wait wait wait. Do you have any
jackets or coat, or something for us?

32:42.861 --> 32:44.494
The red cross has all that for
you.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.596
No I mean we are talking about right now.
We're freezing.

32:46.598 --> 32:48.198
I can't help you.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.500
Is your phone working?

32:50.502 --> 32:52.225
No. Look we gotta go. I
just came back for these

32:52.238 --> 32:53.971
files, and I have them.
We have to go. C'mon.

32:53.973 --> 32:56.073
But I can't go out like this.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.608
Look it's better to be outside then inside.
You don't have to

32:58.610 --> 33:00.043
Worry about things
falling in your head.

33:00.045 --> 33:01.111
C'mon!

33:01.113 --> 33:02.245
Let's go.

33:03.381 --> 33:05.382
Hey wait!

33:05.384 --> 33:07.484
Move your asses.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.886
Hey! We don't know where we're
going.

33:09.888 --> 33:12.656
I think we are suppose
to stand on the doorway.

33:15.326 --> 33:16.860
Oh!

33:17.362 --> 33:19.229
This is stupid. Let's go.

33:20.131 --> 33:21.665
Whoa!

33:30.041 --> 33:31.274
You all right?

33:31.276 --> 33:34.678
I don't think I broke anything.
How are you?

33:34.680 --> 33:38.181
Yeah. Lucky I landed on you.

33:50.361 --> 33:53.430
Ryan, kicking it is not gonna open it.
It has a metal door.

33:53.664 --> 33:55.699
It must be some kind
of vault or something.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.200
Alright then we climb out.

33:59.437 --> 34:02.472
Ryan? Don't tell me we're
trapped down here.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.974
We're not trapped down here.

34:03.976 --> 34:06.710
Yeah but is that true?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.210
That's what I'm working on.

34:10.949 --> 34:12.882
We gotta get out of here.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.384
Ok.

34:15.053 --> 34:16.953
I'm going to boost you up ok?

34:16.955 --> 34:20.123
Just step right here. Boost up,
you climb out, and just go.

34:20.125 --> 34:21.891
And the what?

34:21.893 --> 34:23.560
You get outta the building as fast
as you can before it comes down.

34:23.562 --> 34:24.728
Yeah but what about you?

34:24.730 --> 34:26.663
We'll figure something out?

34:26.665 --> 34:29.565
We'll figure something out? What do
you mean we'll figure something out?

34:29.568 --> 34:31.507
What are you gonna do? Climb up?
Jump up? Light

34:31.520 --> 34:33.469
a bat signal? We have
to get out of here.

34:33.472 --> 34:36.206
That's what I'm talking about!
Let's go! Come on!

34:38.810 --> 34:40.811
I'm not leaving you.

34:40.813 --> 34:42.402
Taryn, just go. Alright?
Get out of the building.

34:42.415 --> 34:44.014
I'll be right behind you.

34:44.016 --> 34:46.917
You will not. Don't lie to me
ryan.

34:46.918 --> 34:50.353
What do you want me to do taryn?
If we stay here we die.

34:50.355 --> 34:52.522
Alright, get out of here. Save
yourself.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.324
You're out of your freaken mind if you
think I'm going to leave you here.

34:55.327 --> 34:56.760
What am I going to tell dad?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.534
I'm gonna climb up and
figure something out.

35:04.735 --> 35:06.970
I'll come back and get you ok?

35:21.919 --> 35:23.854
I'll be right back. Ok?

35:23.856 --> 35:25.288
I'll be right here.

36:21.846 --> 36:23.413
Hey I found something.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.115
Great, a latter?

36:25.117 --> 36:27.984
Ok just stand in the corner I'm
going to drop this down, ok?

36:32.390 --> 36:35.859
Perfect. Do you have the
other end tied to something?

36:36.794 --> 36:38.128
Give me a second.

37:01.586 --> 37:02.686
I'm all set.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.487
You sure?
Yeah.

37:16.267 --> 37:17.601
Thank god.

37:18.336 --> 37:22.405
oh my god. We
gotta get outta here. C'mon.

37:40.691 --> 37:43.827
Help! Help! Somebody help!

37:53.838 --> 37:58.074
Ryan! Ryan! Ryan! What happened?

37:59.543 --> 38:02.912
You've been electrocuted.
You're going to be alright.

38:15.059 --> 38:18.061
I don't know how to work this thing.
What do I do with this thing?

38:18.063 --> 38:19.896
I don't know what to do?

38:19.898 --> 38:23.867
Help! Help somebody! Help me!

38:25.436 --> 38:27.437
What happened?

38:27.439 --> 38:28.811
I don't know. He's had a
million volts of electricity.

38:28.824 --> 38:30.206
He's been electrocuted. Please.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.575
Put those back. Put those back!

38:32.577 --> 38:34.311
Ok ok don't yell at me.

38:34.478 --> 38:38.181
I gotta check his heart beat...
It's there but it's irregular.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.952
Clear

38:44.890 --> 38:47.057
Ryan! I thought you left.

38:47.059 --> 38:49.565
No no the tremor hit me
in the head, knocked

38:49.578 --> 38:52.095
me out and the
screaming woke me up.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.398
Can you walk?
Ryan!
Come on.

38:55.400 --> 39:02.605
You ok? You ok? Ok we gotta go.
C'mon.

39:14.318 --> 39:15.318
Hey!

39:15.953 --> 39:17.721
Wait, now where?

39:18.923 --> 39:23.526
The louvre. If he was right about the
red cross that's where they'll be.

39:23.761 --> 39:25.128
Where is it?

39:25.296 --> 39:28.298
Union river. By the pound north.

39:39.878 --> 39:41.978
What's up?

39:41.980 --> 39:44.537
We're not gonna make it,
we're not gonna make it.

39:44.550 --> 39:47.117
I'm going to talk to this guy.

39:52.923 --> 39:55.191
Excuse me I have a reservation.

39:55.193 --> 39:56.025
Departure hanger?

39:56.027 --> 39:58.027
What's that?

39:58.029 --> 40:00.330
You can't board without a departure hanger.
The machine is over there.

40:00.332 --> 40:03.366
Can you just check, it's steve
foster, foster, f- o-s-t.

40:03.368 --> 40:05.702
I can here you. I just don't
care.

40:05.704 --> 40:08.037
I don't think you understand,
colonel dillard called

40:08.039 --> 40:09.672
Personally to make a
reservation for me.

40:09.674 --> 40:12.041
If you have a reservation, you
get your departure hanger over

40:12.043 --> 40:14.544
There. Not that it'll do any
good.

40:14.546 --> 40:16.246
And why's that?

40:16.248 --> 40:20.383
They are hours behind. Those people
where meant to be on the 9am.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.585
And they have been here all day.

40:22.587 --> 40:32.695
I hear that the next train might be
the last because of the weather.

40:32.697 --> 40:40.904
I hear that the next train might be
the last because of the weather.

40:40.906 --> 40:44.174
Steve!

40:44.176 --> 40:46.309
What the hell are you doing?

40:46.311 --> 40:48.511
We're not gonna get a pass, the whole
system's falling apart and we're running

40:48.513 --> 40:51.748
Out of time. Let's try to use the
service tunnel. Call the kids.

40:59.257 --> 41:01.257
Is that your phone? No way!
It's still working?

41:01.259 --> 41:05.929
Yeah it's dad, hello dad, where are
you guys, did you hear what happened?

41:05.931 --> 41:07.564
Taryn thank god, listen it's
lacey.

41:07.566 --> 41:09.466
They alright?

41:09.468 --> 41:12.769
Uh, your father's busy driving are you ok?,
is, is your brother with you? Is he safe?

41:12.771 --> 41:16.973
Ryan is here. We're fine. We're
fine but the city is horrible.

41:16.975 --> 41:20.043
Ok listen everything's going
to be fine, we have a plan.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.344
Ok, what's the plan?

41:21.346 --> 41:23.680
We need a place to rendezvous.

41:23.682 --> 41:27.984
Ok listen, we need a place we can find you,
what do you see around you, what's nearby?

41:27.986 --> 41:31.154
Nothing. Nothing it's all gone.

41:31.156 --> 41:32.622
What are they asking?

41:32.624 --> 41:35.225
They need a place to meet us.
The embassy?

41:39.997 --> 41:41.698
The tower.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.367
The eiffel tower, it's still
there.

41:44.369 --> 41:46.469
They say the eiffel
tower's still standing.

41:46.471 --> 41:47.760
Perfect, tell 'em to
go to the tower and

41:47.773 --> 41:49.072
find a safe place to
stay and look out for a

41:49.074 --> 41:53.676
Helicopter. We'll be there, it'll
take some time but we'll get there.

42:01.085 --> 42:05.255
Corporal I'm major foster, us air force.
I need access to the service tunnel.

42:05.257 --> 42:07.557
Sorry sir, this tunnel
is for emergencies only.

42:07.559 --> 42:10.426
This is an emergency corporal,
I need to get to France.

42:10.428 --> 42:12.629
So do all those people.

42:12.631 --> 42:15.798
My children are stranded in paris
corporal, I need to get to them.

42:15.800 --> 42:19.602
My mom's in reykjavík. We
haven't spoken since yesterday.

42:23.107 --> 42:25.208
I understand sir.

42:30.814 --> 42:32.015
What's the problem?

42:32.017 --> 42:33.850
He's not gonna let us
through

42:40.858 --> 42:42.325
Look at that!

42:45.029 --> 42:47.163
When more people realize
they won't get through.

42:47.165 --> 42:50.166
It's getting ugly out there. And
it's only going to get worse

42:50.168 --> 42:51.868
We're running out of time.
They're going to close this

42:51.870 --> 42:53.570
Tunnel and we're never
going to get out of here.

42:57.174 --> 42:58.808
Ah the hell with it. Hold on.

43:02.980 --> 43:04.881
Alright, we're on our way.

43:07.685 --> 43:11.721
Whoo I'm freezing my ass off.
We need coats.

43:11.723 --> 43:12.722
You're telling me.

43:12.724 --> 43:15.197
Hey look, best case scenario.
They're not gonna

43:15.210 --> 43:17.694
be here for another 3
hours, probably more.

43:17.696 --> 43:19.596
Yeah.

43:19.598 --> 43:21.564
So why don't we go find coats and
somewhere warm where we can rest a while.

43:21.566 --> 43:23.967
Ok but I don't want to want
to miss them at the tower.

43:23.969 --> 43:26.075
Neither do I. We get
pneumonia out here, we're

43:26.088 --> 43:28.204
not going to be doing
anyone any favors.

43:31.642 --> 43:34.844
They're still in England, right? They have
to find the helicopter where ever the hell

43:34.846 --> 43:39.415
That is. Then fly to paris. It's
gonna be a while. And it's cold.

43:42.386 --> 43:45.388
Ok. Where do you want to go?

43:45.390 --> 43:47.590
Uh, I don't know. This way?

43:47.592 --> 43:50.860
At least it's in the
direction of the louvre.

43:51.562 --> 43:53.162
What is it? What is it? What is
it?

43:53.164 --> 43:55.131
The army is rounding up people
probably for evacuation.

43:55.133 --> 43:56.666
Well that's a good thing right?

43:56.668 --> 43:58.968
Not if it stops us from
getting to lacey and dad.

43:58.970 --> 44:03.539
Whatever is going on here. Staying at a
refugee camp is not gonna save us ok?

44:03.541 --> 44:04.607
C'mon.

44:06.510 --> 44:11.347
Wait ryan? The cold. It's freezing. I don't
want to die out here in the streets.

44:11.349 --> 44:13.416
Here. Here. Let me think.

44:14.752 --> 44:15.785
Where are we?

44:17.621 --> 44:19.789
Avenue george. I know what we
can do.

44:19.791 --> 44:20.857
What?

44:20.859 --> 44:23.726
Run to the fourreur industries.
C'mon.

44:27.231 --> 44:29.132
See.

44:29.134 --> 44:31.234
They actually teach you something
useful in fashion school, huh.

44:31.935 --> 44:33.336
Let's go.

44:39.276 --> 44:40.810
I don't think there's anyone
here.

44:41.378 --> 44:43.279
It doesn't look like
there's anything here.

44:43.781 --> 44:47.550
I guess we are not the 1st people to think
of fourreur's would be a good stop huh.

44:47.552 --> 44:49.519
There's gotta be something.

44:53.223 --> 44:57.794
Hey. Maybe downstairs. There's gotta
be a stock room or something right?

44:57.796 --> 45:01.698
We're going to shop. I'm not
going back out there like this.

45:10.107 --> 45:11.307
Bingo.

45:12.676 --> 45:13.676
Here try this.

45:17.381 --> 45:18.815
Oh, better?

45:18.817 --> 45:19.816
Much.

45:19.818 --> 45:20.817
Oh, we got lucky.

45:20.819 --> 45:22.351
Relatively speaking.

45:32.229 --> 45:34.097
Of course you don't speak
french.

45:34.099 --> 45:35.465
Typical americans.

45:35.467 --> 45:37.366
We're sorry. We didn't think-

45:37.368 --> 45:39.769
You didn't think I'd mind being
robbed.

45:39.771 --> 45:43.506
The lootters already took most of my coats.
But you won't get these.

45:43.508 --> 45:45.641
Sir, please we don't meet any harm.
We just-

45:45.643 --> 45:47.877
You know how it is out there.
It's freezing.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.879
It's only getting colder.
We need these coats.

45:49.881 --> 45:52.615
Then you buy them like anyone
else.

45:53.383 --> 45:55.585
Ok yeah. Fine sure. How much?

45:55.587 --> 45:59.044
Price is determined by need.
And your need is great.

45:59.057 --> 46:02.525
So the price is
will be great also.

46:04.495 --> 46:09.532
I'd say ... 20,000 euros.
A piece.

46:09.833 --> 46:11.634
20,000 euros? That's ridiculous.

46:11.636 --> 46:13.736
Yeah. Who's robbing who here?

46:13.738 --> 46:15.404
Please sir. Be reasonable.

46:15.406 --> 46:20.877
- Leave my money or leave my coats.
- or leave both.

46:29.653 --> 46:32.060
We're making good time,
as long as the roads

46:32.073 --> 46:34.490
ahead of us are as good
as they were in England.

46:34.492 --> 46:36.058
And no more earthquakes.

46:36.060 --> 46:37.660
Don't jinx it.

46:37.662 --> 46:39.929
It's not the snow I'm so
worried about, it's the wind.

46:39.931 --> 46:40.797
Steve.

46:40.799 --> 46:42.765
Right, my lips are sealed.

46:44.434 --> 46:46.803
This really is what you do isn't
it?

46:46.805 --> 46:48.237
What's that?

46:48.239 --> 46:51.340
Keep cool in a crisis, rise to
the challenge, find solutions.

46:51.342 --> 46:55.178
Well, that is what I was trained for,
unfortunately I wasn't trained in raising a

46:55.180 --> 46:56.612
Family, but it's going to work this
time I promise you, no it will work.

46:56.614 --> 46:58.014
Yeah it's gonna work.

46:58.016 --> 47:00.449
It's gonna work, I'll make sure
it works.

47:00.451 --> 47:03.225
Australia will be the
true test of that. All

47:03.238 --> 47:06.022
four of us livin' in a
little tent together?

47:06.024 --> 47:08.380
Australia, I wonder what
that's going to be like...

47:08.393 --> 47:10.760
I'll certainly get
to know your kids.

47:10.762 --> 47:12.495
Yeah...

47:12.497 --> 47:16.032
I'm sure they found some place in
paris to get some cold weather gear.

47:16.034 --> 47:18.267
Yeah I'm sure.

47:18.269 --> 47:22.772
Knowing taryn, she probably spent 3000
dollars on some skimpy little ski jacket.

47:24.709 --> 47:28.377
You know I think you're a much better
father than you give yourself credit for.

47:28.379 --> 47:30.179
Well thanks.

47:30.181 --> 47:32.882
I'm sure they're just a couple of
chips right off the old block.

47:32.884 --> 47:35.518
Well let's hope, right now our
mission is to find 'em, make

47:35.520 --> 47:39.021
Sure they're safe and,
get them out of paris.

47:39.023 --> 47:40.923
Roger that major..

47:44.795 --> 47:47.296
Look, easy here. Here take my
credit card.

47:47.298 --> 47:48.931
Cash only. Mona mi.

47:48.933 --> 47:51.968
We don't have that kinda cash.
Who would? Please just...

47:53.503 --> 47:54.470
We gotta get outta here.

47:54.472 --> 47:55.271
No.

48:02.980 --> 48:04.013
Taryn.

48:04.348 --> 48:05.681
Ryan!

48:09.386 --> 48:10.519
Ryan!

48:10.521 --> 48:11.520
Tyran!

48:11.522 --> 48:13.189
I'm trapped.

48:15.525 --> 48:18.127
I can't lift it. It's too heavy.

48:18.129 --> 48:21.731
Oh my god the ceiling!
It's not gonna hold.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.000
Ryan hurry!

48:28.639 --> 48:29.872
You gotta get me out.

48:31.808 --> 48:32.675
Ryan!

48:35.512 --> 48:36.913
I'm going to go for some help,
ok?

48:36.915 --> 48:39.982
Help? Where? Ryan, you
can't leave me here.

48:39.984 --> 48:41.790
Tyran, I have to. I can't
lift this by myself.

48:41.803 --> 48:43.619
We need help, ok?

48:43.621 --> 48:45.655
Look, I won't be a minute,
alright?

48:46.123 --> 48:48.791
Ryan! Ryan, you can't leave me
here.

48:49.860 --> 48:54.797
Just hang tight. I'll be right back, ok?
I promise.

49:01.772 --> 49:03.873
Hey help! Help! Hey.

49:05.909 --> 49:06.842
Hey!

49:07.778 --> 49:10.146
Sir. You got to help me.

49:13.251 --> 49:15.718
Hey. It's you.

49:15.986 --> 49:18.109
My sister ... Um she's
downstairs, she's trapped.

49:18.122 --> 49:20.256
<i>S'il vous plait</i> . Please.

49:45.749 --> 49:47.216
Ryan, you didn't bring anybody?

49:47.218 --> 49:49.885
It's crazy out there but I
brought this.

49:49.887 --> 49:53.656
I'm going to lift it up as high as I can.
You run as fast as you can out, ok?

49:53.658 --> 49:54.623
Ok, do it!

49:54.791 --> 49:56.492
1...2...3.

49:59.197 --> 50:00.563
Higher.

50:00.565 --> 50:01.964
I'm trying.

50:06.336 --> 50:07.703
Go. Go. Go.

50:22.786 --> 50:24.587
Ryan, thank you so much.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.294
Sorry I called you a pervert.

50:32.296 --> 50:36.165
that's the 1st thing you
think of to apologize to me for?

50:36.400 --> 50:37.533
Shut up.

50:37.535 --> 50:38.434
Ok.

50:38.436 --> 50:39.769
Ouch!

50:39.771 --> 50:41.003
How bad is that?

50:41.005 --> 50:42.705
Damn these were 200 dollar
jeans.

50:42.707 --> 50:44.974
Right but are ya gonna die of
tetanus?

50:46.076 --> 50:48.677
It hurts but the cut is not that deep.
I'll be fine.

50:48.679 --> 50:53.382
Ok, good. We need to get a cross the <i>sei</i>.
The tower is on the <i>rive droite.</i>

50:53.384 --> 50:55.384
Wow ryan. That's impressive.

50:55.386 --> 50:58.954
No not really. That's the only bit of
french I've learned since I've been here.

50:58.956 --> 51:01.690
That and "it's ok I'm a doctor."

51:03.393 --> 51:05.194
Alright. Well let's find somewhere
warm and dry until they get here.

51:05.196 --> 51:07.463
Yeah. I could so go for a
nice cup of coffee right now.

51:07.465 --> 51:13.235
Mmm coffee. How about a hazelnut crepe?
Chocolate a claire? Foot rub?

51:13.237 --> 51:16.338
Sarcasm isn't helpful right now
taryn.

51:17.441 --> 51:18.541
Ana.

51:18.543 --> 51:19.975
Yes doctor?

51:19.977 --> 51:21.544
I want you to check my work.

51:21.546 --> 51:23.813
Sir.

51:23.815 --> 51:28.951
I think perhaps I've made a mistake because
what I'm looking at here is unprecedented.

51:28.953 --> 51:31.821
I can't send it to nato until
I am sure it is correct.

51:31.823 --> 51:34.056
Of course dr goldschein.

51:34.058 --> 51:37.766
Ana have you ever heard
about uh an ice cyclone?

51:37.779 --> 51:41.497
Is there any record
of such a thing?

51:41.499 --> 51:42.998
Not that I know of doctor.

51:43.000 --> 51:46.202
Well, check the figures.

51:46.204 --> 51:50.873
Otherwise I wouldn't want to think what an
ice cyclone could do in a city like paris.

52:03.920 --> 52:06.455
Was that an earthquake?

52:06.457 --> 52:08.157
Maybe just a passing tremor.

52:08.159 --> 52:12.094
Still, I'll feel safer when
we're above sea level again.

52:12.096 --> 52:14.363
About ten minutes and we'll be
up top.

52:21.705 --> 52:23.939
Just a few miles to go now.

52:23.941 --> 52:25.574
Then how far to evreux?

52:25.576 --> 52:29.211
About two hours tops, depending
on the road conditions.

52:29.213 --> 52:32.148
I wonder which is going to be
worse, the main roads or the back.

52:32.150 --> 52:34.884
What was that? Was that another
tremor?

52:34.886 --> 52:37.153
I don't know but I didn't
like the sound of it.

52:38.021 --> 52:39.722
Another one, but, it's getting
closer.

52:39.724 --> 52:45.461
What is that?

52:45.463 --> 52:46.595
Steve!

52:46.597 --> 52:48.197
Holy cow!

52:48.199 --> 52:49.298
What is that?

52:49.300 --> 52:51.400
That's the english chanel coming
in.

52:51.402 --> 52:53.302
Just go!, just go.

52:57.741 --> 52:59.141
Go faster!

52:59.143 --> 53:01.410
I'm going fast, I git I I I got
it at max!

53:01.412 --> 53:03.012
Look, its right in front of
us you see it? Cmon cmon!

53:03.014 --> 53:04.580
No just, stay in the
gah I see it I see it!

53:04.582 --> 53:05.915
Come on. Come on.

53:05.917 --> 53:07.249
It's coming in everywhere look
at that!

53:07.251 --> 53:08.417
I see it.

53:08.419 --> 53:09.451
Look at that! It's getting
closer to us!

53:09.453 --> 53:11.420
Honey I see it.

53:11.422 --> 53:13.622
Just keep going! Go, it's coming in
behind us, it's getting closer, cmon!

53:13.624 --> 53:16.792
There's the exit! There's the exit!
Brace youself! Brace yourself!

53:24.935 --> 53:26.869
How many dead?

53:26.871 --> 53:29.939
Over a thousand. The trains were
full to capacity. Over full.

53:29.941 --> 53:31.947
Well, I suppose that
it's just a drop in the

53:31.960 --> 53:33.976
bucket compared to the
millions are gonna

53:33.978 --> 53:36.212
Die before this is over.

53:37.647 --> 53:40.082
And it was the 1pm departure?

53:41.985 --> 53:45.788
that's the one I booked steve
on.

53:46.923 --> 53:48.991
he was a good man.

53:49.292 --> 53:53.062
Anyway. I might be able to do
something for his children.

53:53.064 --> 53:55.764
Paris. They're evacuating
paris, aren't they?

53:55.766 --> 53:59.435
Yes sir. They've rounded up the survivors
and put them in temporary shelters.

53:59.437 --> 54:04.807
Right. Download pictures of the kids.
Send them to who ever is in charge.

54:04.809 --> 54:06.842
And see if they can get them
here.

54:06.844 --> 54:08.483
But sir, why all this
effort for 2 americans?

54:08.496 --> 54:10.145
With all these sevilliance-

54:10.147 --> 54:13.215
Because I owe the man.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.718
He saved my life once.

54:16.253 --> 54:20.445
We flew together for years.
E3 centuries,

54:20.458 --> 54:24.660
desert storm, and a lot
of other operations.

54:24.662 --> 54:27.452
95 we were in alaska.
Took off on a perfectly

54:27.465 --> 54:30.266
clear day and injested
an entire flock

54:30.268 --> 54:35.037
Of canada gees. The plane went
down like a stone. Everyone on

54:35.039 --> 54:37.172
Board were killed or
seriously wounded..

54:37.707 --> 54:42.778
I was unconscious, steve was wounded but
he found me, pulled me out of the wreckage

54:42.780 --> 54:47.016
And carried me on his back 3
miles back to headquarters.

54:48.084 --> 54:50.819
We don't forget things like
that.

54:51.821 --> 54:54.957
There is a chance they made it
through before the quake of course.

54:56.626 --> 55:00.462
Yes. Yes you are quite right.
He might have.

55:01.031 --> 55:02.998
Alright, I'll try to get him on
his c-

55:03.000 --> 55:07.136
But 1st sir, did you get a chance to
look at goldschein revized model?

55:07.138 --> 55:10.172
No no. I've been dealing
with operational matters.

55:10.540 --> 55:12.141
What now?

55:13.376 --> 55:14.710
Oh my god.

55:15.145 --> 55:17.212
This is like a sick joke.

55:21.051 --> 55:23.886
If I said our luck was holdin' up
would you consider that a jinx?

55:23.888 --> 55:26.655
Well yeah, but now it's too
late.

55:26.657 --> 55:27.790
Well we are ahead of schedule.

55:29.860 --> 55:32.294
Oh dillard's calling back

55:32.296 --> 55:34.263
Hello? Colonel dillard?

55:34.265 --> 55:37.766
Hello, steve? Steve this is
dillard.

55:37.768 --> 55:41.370
Um, uh, this is lacey
foster, steve's wife.

55:41.372 --> 55:43.672
I can't understand what
you're staying. Hello?

55:43.674 --> 55:47.476
Colonel, I think that's you, we are in
France, a couple of hours from evreux.

55:47.478 --> 55:53.415
I can't hear you. Listen there
has been a change of plan.

55:53.417 --> 55:58.721
Paris is unsafe. Don't go to paris.
Storm coming.

55:58.723 --> 56:01.724
Hello? Colonel dillard?

56:01.726 --> 56:06.328
the kids...
Are directly ... Danger...

56:06.330 --> 56:13.402
Now, I will arrange to have
the kids picked up.

56:13.404 --> 56:19.308
If you can get to evreux,
the helicopter...

56:19.310 --> 56:25.948
I can't, something about a storm and the
kids and evreux, and... I don't know.

56:25.950 --> 56:28.684
Look, I hope you understand this
message.

56:28.686 --> 56:31.687
Colonel, can you hear me? Can
you repeat?

56:31.689 --> 56:38.093
- Can't understand a word you're saying.
- Got to go now.  god bless.

56:38.095 --> 56:40.195
Uhhh lost the signal.

56:40.930 --> 56:43.432
Now what?

56:43.434 --> 56:45.701
We'll have to just stick to the
plan that's all we can do.

56:50.473 --> 56:52.174
This part of the city seems
quiet.

56:52.176 --> 56:54.309
It must have been evacuated
already.

56:54.311 --> 56:55.177
Hey.

56:55.179 --> 56:58.380
There's gotta be an unlocked
door somewhere around here.

56:58.382 --> 57:02.718
If we can get inside someplace, preferably
someplace with food and power we outta be

57:02.720 --> 57:04.887
Safe and warm until it's time
to meet up with dad and lacey.

57:04.889 --> 57:07.990
Ok, breaking and entering,
great plan ryan, great.

57:07.992 --> 57:10.259
You wanna be law abiding
or you wanna be warm?

57:14.030 --> 57:16.698
Come on, come on come on.

57:16.700 --> 57:18.634
Damn he saw us.

57:18.636 --> 57:20.736
Where are we gonna go.

57:22.973 --> 57:26.375
We can't run. He'd follow, probably call
others, we'd just get further away from the

57:26.377 --> 57:29.645
Tower, uh, maybe we
can reason with him?

57:33.384 --> 57:37.719
He doesn't sound too reasonable,

57:39.023 --> 57:41.657
He doesn't look that reasonable
either.

57:41.659 --> 57:44.526
Look ryan, we don't know this guy, we
don't know where he would take us.

57:44.528 --> 57:48.130
Dad is risking everything to be at the
tower, we need to be there when he arrives.

57:48.132 --> 57:50.232
You're right c'mon!.

57:53.269 --> 57:58.140
Alright easy, easy, look
we don't mean any harm.

57:58.142 --> 58:00.242
American?

58:09.886 --> 58:13.689
You need to come with me. Everyone
is being evacuated. We have shelter

58:13.691 --> 58:15.824
Outside the city with food
and medical supplies.

58:15.826 --> 58:18.260
No we can't do that we're meeting
our parents at the eiffel tower.

58:18.262 --> 58:21.730
No no, you come with me. Your parents
are probably in the shelter already.

58:21.732 --> 58:24.166
No, no, no. You don't
understand our parents...

58:24.168 --> 58:25.707
No you don't understand.
A national disaster

58:25.720 --> 58:27.269
has occurred. We need
to get everyone to

58:27.271 --> 58:28.971
A place of safety.

58:28.973 --> 58:30.506
Safety? Where? This isn't just
some storm, don't you get it?

58:32.742 --> 58:36.478
I am not asking. Come with me
now.

58:36.480 --> 58:37.746
Look we can't we're sorry.

58:40.017 --> 58:44.820
I have my order and now you have yours.
You come with me for your own safety.

58:44.822 --> 58:49.057
Alright alright just don't
shoot us for our own safety.

58:49.059 --> 58:50.626
Get back, get in.

59:03.373 --> 59:10.178
Hey.

59:10.547 --> 59:11.613
Angelique.

59:13.983 --> 59:15.417
Really?

59:20.123 --> 59:21.256
How much further?

59:21.258 --> 59:23.091
Ten or twelve miles.

59:23.093 --> 59:24.092
Are we good on gas?

59:24.094 --> 59:26.728
Oh yeah we're doing great.

59:26.730 --> 59:29.231
Alrighty then. Nap time.

59:35.939 --> 59:39.408
Whoa, you alright?!

59:39.410 --> 59:42.678
That wind came out of nowhere -
must be 60/70 miles an hour!

59:46.916 --> 59:48.183
Well what can we do?

59:50.186 --> 59:52.487
We might have to pull
over until it passes.

59:52.489 --> 59:53.755
Can we spare the time?

59:55.758 --> 59:58.226
Not really but... We
might not have a choice.

01:00:03.700 --> 01:00:04.232
Argh, argh.

01:00:04.234 --> 01:00:06.535
Oh steve!

01:00:06.537 --> 01:00:12.841
Hold on!

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:13.675
You alright?

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:14.843
Yeah. You?

01:00:14.845 --> 01:00:18.880
Yeah. Yeah... Ok.

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:22.918
Oh come on.

01:00:23.886 --> 01:00:27.089
looks like
we're on foot from here soldier.

01:00:27.091 --> 01:00:28.824
Oh foot?

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:33.195
yeah. It's alright.
It's only a couple miles.

01:00:33.197 --> 01:00:33.895
Ha, a couple miles.

01:00:33.897 --> 01:00:35.030
Yeah.

01:00:35.032 --> 01:00:36.865
How are we gonna find the base?

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:40.235
It's fine. I have all the
coordinates in the gps on my watch.

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:41.903
Ready for a little hike soldier?

01:00:41.905 --> 01:00:43.005
Sure.

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:44.239
Come on. Let's get the gear.

01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.556
There you go,

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:13.468
Southwest. This way.

01:01:19.776 --> 01:01:22.978
You will see. The shelter is probably
the best place for you to be.

01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:25.514
Most likely your parents are
already there waiting for you.

01:01:25.516 --> 01:01:27.121
Sir, we know you're just
trying to do your job

01:01:27.134 --> 01:01:28.750
but we really need to
get to the tower, ok.

01:01:28.752 --> 01:01:30.986
Our parents are coming
in from out of town.

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:32.176
No one is coming in from
out of town, mister.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.388
Of that I can assure you.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:36.214
Our dad is an air force pilot.
Or use to be.

01:01:36.227 --> 01:01:39.061
And is sending a
helicopter to pick us up.

01:01:39.063 --> 01:01:40.529
You need to let us go.

01:01:40.531 --> 01:01:42.097
I am sorry mad' masel but...

01:01:42.099 --> 01:01:43.432
Look out!

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:47.936
Oh my god.

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:52.774
Everyone alright?

01:01:52.776 --> 01:01:54.710
Yeah I'm fine.

01:01:56.312 --> 01:01:57.379
Is he alright?

01:01:57.613 --> 01:01:58.847
I don't think so.

01:01:59.982 --> 01:02:00.982
Hey!

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:04.986
Oh my god, we're stuck!

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:07.255
He's got them on safety lock.

01:02:09.459 --> 01:02:10.859
Do you smell that?

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:13.328
Gasoline.

01:02:14.997 --> 01:02:16.565
Oh my god, it's leaking!

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:28.477
Quick, we gotta get out of here.

01:02:28.479 --> 01:02:30.312
Come on. Come on!

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.762
What about her?

01:02:55.638 --> 01:02:57.706
you ok?

01:02:59.008 --> 01:03:00.776
I'm a little dizzy.

01:03:03.412 --> 01:03:04.679
Hey.
Hey.

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.392
We need to get out of here.

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:18.660
Where?

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.264
The eiffel tower.
The eiffel tower.

01:03:31.408 --> 01:03:34.409
Short cut. Come come.

01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:02.771
Can we rest for a second, it's
been hours.

01:04:02.773 --> 01:04:05.340
C'mon honey we gotta keep moving, we
gotta keep the blood circulating.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:08.443
My legs are on fire, but the
rest of me's numb with cold.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.545
We gotta keep movin honey c'mon.

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:15.617
Oh!

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:19.454
Here, lacey

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:49.484
We're here!

01:04:49.486 --> 01:04:51.620
What really, oh I can't believe
it.

01:04:51.622 --> 01:04:52.954
And still on schedule!

01:04:52.956 --> 01:04:55.023
Don't jinx it, cmon.

01:04:58.227 --> 01:05:01.997
Steve! Steve!

01:05:01.999 --> 01:05:02.998
Lacey!

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:21.616
Well, it beats walking.

01:05:21.618 --> 01:05:22.584
You alright?

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:23.952
yeah

01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:30.258
It's creepy, there's nobody
here.

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:32.227
Let's hope someone's still here.

01:05:32.229 --> 01:05:34.129
Hello!

01:05:34.964 --> 01:05:35.597
Hello!

01:05:35.599 --> 01:05:37.632
Anybody here?!

01:05:37.634 --> 01:05:39.901
Colonel dillard sent us!

01:05:42.104 --> 01:05:43.071
Foster! Over here.

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:44.139
Yeah!

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.844
C'mon, get in!

01:05:51.714 --> 01:05:53.548
Lieutenant carl redding
sir, glad you made it.

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:55.250
Thank you lt. This is my wife
lacey.

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:57.185
Well now that you're here why
don't we get the hell out?

01:05:57.187 --> 01:05:59.788
Good idea, I'll get the
doors and you start her up!

01:05:59.790 --> 01:06:01.756
Well actually, I heard you're a
hell of a pilot, why I don't I

01:06:01.758 --> 01:06:03.191
Get these doors and
you fire it up!

01:06:03.193 --> 01:06:04.626
You got it!

01:06:13.636 --> 01:06:15.070
Main rotter.

01:06:15.072 --> 01:06:16.004
Clear

01:06:16.006 --> 01:06:16.771
Throttle.

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:17.839
Open

01:06:17.841 --> 01:06:18.473
Starter.

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:19.741
Engaging

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.845
Oil pressure 10% n1, I should go
help him.

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:30.952
Thanks.

01:06:45.334 --> 01:06:46.234
Main rotter?

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:48.169
Turning by 25%.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.237
Starter.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:50.939
Ignition at 58%.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.513
Oh! I'm ok.

01:06:58.515 --> 01:06:59.781
He needs my help again.

01:07:20.803 --> 01:07:22.771
We need to make up for lost
time.

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.844
Oh. Good job.

01:08:11.587 --> 01:08:13.688
How long until dad and lacey get
here?

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.758
Honestly it could be any time. They
still have to get the helicopter.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:19.594
I really hope we don't
miss them at the tower.

01:08:19.828 --> 01:08:21.462
That would really suck.

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:23.398
We're not gonna miss them.
We are making good time.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:27.335
Ok, well we don't need any
distractions.

01:08:27.903 --> 01:08:30.071
She's the one that knew
where the tunnel was.

01:08:30.506 --> 01:08:32.807
Geez, we couldn't have left her back there.
That would be like murder.

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:34.776
It's getting worse
by the minute.

01:08:35.277 --> 01:08:36.277
Stop!

01:08:37.179 --> 01:08:38.179
Nice bike.

01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:40.881
We'll take that.

01:08:41.517 --> 01:08:42.183
You can't take our-

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:46.220
No body said you could speak.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:48.156
Understand?

01:08:49.390 --> 01:08:50.959
Yeah. I understand.

01:08:51.727 --> 01:08:55.729
Good. So ... We'll take the
bikes.

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:01.669
And the coats too.

01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:04.738
What? You can't take the -

01:09:05.608 --> 01:09:06.640
Ryan.

01:09:06.841 --> 01:09:08.810
The coats! Now!

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:11.011
Lady.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.819
Ryan.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:28.385
Don't look so sad. You're
lucky you keep your shoes.

01:09:28.398 --> 01:09:32.233
Or should I take them too?

01:09:32.234 --> 01:09:34.269
No please.

01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:37.205
Kidding.

01:09:39.707 --> 01:09:40.942
Take off.

01:10:04.433 --> 01:10:05.567
Noooo.

01:10:05.569 --> 01:10:07.669
Man, not another earthquake.

01:10:07.671 --> 01:10:09.571
Oh, this is getting' old.

01:10:09.573 --> 01:10:10.838
C'mon.

01:10:13.242 --> 01:10:14.275
Ce que se pasee?!

01:10:14.277 --> 01:10:16.644
I don't know! The water in the
pipes?

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:19.414
The water...It's freezing, it's
causing the pipes to burst.

01:10:19.416 --> 01:10:20.481
Let's go.

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:29.424
Hey!

01:10:29.426 --> 01:10:30.058
Taryn?

01:10:31.293 --> 01:10:32.360
You ok?

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:43.504
Ryan!

01:10:47.276 --> 01:10:48.343
Oh my god.

01:10:57.152 --> 01:10:58.720
Damn it, it's locked.

01:10:58.722 --> 01:11:00.822
I'm gonna try the stairs let's
go.

01:11:19.775 --> 01:11:21.976
This is really bad.

01:11:21.978 --> 01:11:24.245
I've never seen anything
like this berfore.

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:27.915
Can we get above it?

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:31.486
I'm worried about navigation. Half
the instruments are out as it is.

01:11:31.754 --> 01:11:33.254
But it's worth a try.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:41.195
Oh wow. We gotta get over that.

01:11:43.832 --> 01:11:44.899
Uh oh.

01:11:44.901 --> 01:11:47.068
Don't say uh oh. No uh oh.

01:11:47.070 --> 01:11:48.536
Main rotter warning.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:49.937
What?

01:11:49.939 --> 01:11:53.074
Dammit. Engine stall. Must be
the ash.

01:11:53.076 --> 01:11:54.042
Are we gonna crash?

01:11:54.044 --> 01:11:55.476
Not if I can help it.

01:12:02.117 --> 01:12:03.685
We're falling.

01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:04.752
Honey, I got it under control.

01:12:04.754 --> 01:12:06.854
We're falling.

01:12:06.856 --> 01:12:08.790
Honey, I got it under control. I've
trained for this exact scenario, alright?

01:12:08.792 --> 01:12:11.693
It's called an auto rotation.
We keep the rotter angled.

01:12:11.695 --> 01:12:14.729
The blades spinning. We'll have a
controlled decent. Understand?

01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:16.297
Yeah. I think so.

01:12:16.465 --> 01:12:19.033
Just got to give the
engine time to recover.

01:12:23.505 --> 01:12:24.806
Are we gonna land?

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:26.140
We might have to.

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:27.075
Are we gonna crash?

01:12:27.077 --> 01:12:28.276
We might have too.

01:12:28.278 --> 01:12:28.976
Steve.

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:30.144
Honey, it's ok.

01:12:30.713 --> 01:12:32.413
Steve!

01:12:32.415 --> 01:12:34.282
I'll try one more time. Just
give the engine time to kick in.

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:45.727
Are we dead?

01:12:45.729 --> 01:12:47.061
I don't think so.

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:50.264
Did we crash?

01:12:50.266 --> 01:12:52.066
I don't think so.

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:53.935
are we going to be ok?

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:56.371
I think so honey.

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.840
Next time we'll take a cruise.

01:12:58.842 --> 01:13:01.109
You got a deal.

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:06.214
They did say they were coming
in a helicopter, right?

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:08.216
Where are they going to land?

01:13:08.218 --> 01:13:09.751
Not down there.

01:13:09.753 --> 01:13:12.253
Yeah and not here. Ryan,
what are we gonna do?

01:13:12.255 --> 01:13:13.861
Maybe, maybe if we can
find a way to get to

01:13:13.874 --> 01:13:15.490
the top they can drop a
rope ladder or we can

01:13:15.492 --> 01:13:21.829
Find a way to climb on
board -- I don't know!

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:23.297
You don't know?

01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:26.134
After all this we're just gonna
die here?

01:13:26.136 --> 01:13:28.269
We would have been better
off in a refugee camp ryan.

01:13:28.271 --> 01:13:30.194
You know dad he's
like freakin captain

01:13:30.207 --> 01:13:32.140
america, if anyone can
pull this off he can.

01:13:32.142 --> 01:13:36.477
You still believe that, after all
this, why do you idolize him so much?

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:39.981
Because he's a hero! And I'd be
lucky to be half the man he is.

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:46.687
Well, he'd better not be late,
otherwise he's grounded, for life.

01:13:46.689 --> 01:13:49.957
C'mon, a thousand more
steps.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.249
oh, ohhhh.

01:14:15.251 --> 01:14:17.452
I don't like the sound of that.

01:14:17.454 --> 01:14:21.923
C'mon t. This thing has been standing
since 1889, it's not gonna fall over now.

01:14:21.925 --> 01:14:23.991
But it wasn't built to last.

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:26.093
Have a little faith c'mon!

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:33.801
You ok?

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:35.770
Yeah you ok?

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:37.672
Let's keep going.

01:14:59.295 --> 01:15:01.929
Ok, maybe we should head back
down.

01:15:01.931 --> 01:15:05.867
Yeah.

01:15:05.869 --> 01:15:08.135
Okay, let's keep moving!

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.080
Paris. Where's the tower?

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:22.517
We would be able to see it if it wasn't for
all these storm clouds and all these ashes.

01:15:24.219 --> 01:15:25.520
Oh, there it is.

01:15:27.489 --> 01:15:28.256
Steve.

01:15:28.258 --> 01:15:30.992
Let's just get there
1st and find the kids.

01:15:31.393 --> 01:15:32.693
One crisis at a time.

01:15:40.969 --> 01:15:42.069
Hey it's them.

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:43.237
Really?

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:44.138
I don't know it's a helicopter!

01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:49.076
Hey hey, over here.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:50.878
Come on kids, where are you?

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.547
Do you see them?

01:15:52.981 --> 01:15:54.882
Dad.
Dad.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.387
Maybe they are underneath it?

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:02.056
Maybe, but it could be
unstable down there.

01:16:02.058 --> 01:16:06.827
Hey hey, over here.

01:16:06.829 --> 01:16:09.830
Oh there steve, ryan ryan!

01:16:09.832 --> 01:16:11.766
There is no way he can here you
baby.

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:18.873
Oh thank god!

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:21.809
Incredible right?!

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:26.180
Hey hey, hey!

01:16:26.182 --> 01:16:27.448
What the?

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:32.720
Hurry hurry!

01:16:32.722 --> 01:16:35.656
I see it but I don't know
what the hell it is.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:37.892
May be this is what dillard
was talking about.

01:16:37.894 --> 01:16:39.293
May be.

01:16:39.295 --> 01:16:41.395
All we can do is get there
before it does.

01:16:43.665 --> 01:16:45.299
Read my mind.

01:16:47.869 --> 01:16:50.504
Ryan, if we don't make it out of
here, I just want you to know.

01:16:50.506 --> 01:16:52.540
Yeah yeah yeah no I love you too
t.

01:16:52.542 --> 01:16:57.311
No no no I mean I love
you but I quit school.

01:16:57.313 --> 01:16:59.380
What?! When?!

01:16:59.382 --> 01:17:02.450
A couple months ago, I didn't
want you to be disappointed in me

01:17:02.452 --> 01:17:05.353
You're so much like
dad, in a good way.

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.489
Hopefully that will be the
worst news I get today.

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:34.749
Dammit. I missed it.

01:17:34.751 --> 01:17:35.883
Try again.

01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:54.902
It's alright try again.

01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:06.847
Can you get any closer?

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:11.252
I'm trying. What if the wind
slams us right into that thing.

01:18:24.032 --> 01:18:25.166
T you ok?

01:18:25.168 --> 01:18:27.435
That freakin' hurt.

01:18:27.437 --> 01:18:29.036
I don't like this anymore ryan.

01:18:29.038 --> 01:18:31.305
Me either let's get outta here.

01:18:46.388 --> 01:18:47.688
They got it.

01:18:47.690 --> 01:18:48.789
Hurry.

01:18:54.396 --> 01:18:56.731
Now what? They can't climb this
thing.

01:18:56.733 --> 01:18:59.900
It's alright. We'll have to
slide.

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:05.973
We need a hook or a rod or
something.

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:08.342
I'm on it!

01:19:26.394 --> 01:19:30.397
You're ok? Ready, go!

01:19:30.399 --> 01:19:32.032
Ok get ready.

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:40.608
You ready t?

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:43.077
You got this. You got this. Go

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:00.294
Everybody alright?

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:01.862
Yeah.

01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:03.497
Cut that line.

01:20:24.986 --> 01:20:25.986
Hold on!

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.339
What was that?

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:46.874
We got hit.

01:20:46.876 --> 01:20:48.509
How bad is it?

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:51.478
It's not good. We got 100 miles to go.
Only an hour to get there.

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.880
Are we gonna make it?

01:20:52.882 --> 01:20:55.950
We'll find out soon enough.

01:21:06.795 --> 01:21:08.696
Cornel how come we don't
leave if everyone is here?

01:21:08.698 --> 01:21:10.965
Because not everyone is here.

01:21:10.967 --> 01:21:15.069
You're willing to risk all of our lives for
people who may or may not make it on time?

01:21:15.071 --> 01:21:17.905
The storm is only getting worse.
We should leave this minute.

01:21:17.907 --> 01:21:20.975
Who the hell are they anyway.
We should get out of here.

01:21:20.977 --> 01:21:25.579
The plane leaves on time.
Not a second before.

01:21:29.517 --> 01:21:31.785
Make final preparations for take
off.

01:21:56.845 --> 01:22:02.116
Come on. Come on. Just 10 miles.
We can make it. We can make it.

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:10.057
All set sir. Departure on your
command.

01:22:10.059 --> 01:22:11.692
Very well.

01:22:14.296 --> 01:22:15.362
There's the base.

01:22:15.730 --> 01:22:17.264
I think we are going to be ok.

01:22:17.565 --> 01:22:18.966
Don't jinx it.

01:22:19.467 --> 01:22:21.302
Don't be superstitious honey.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.142
Dad!

01:22:28.343 --> 01:22:30.711
Hold on. We're going down.

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:37.151
Let's just hope the snow
is as soft as it looks.

01:22:37.419 --> 01:22:38.652
I love you daddy.

01:22:38.887 --> 01:22:41.622
I love you too baby. Hold on.

01:22:53.635 --> 01:22:55.636
Wait a minute. There they are.

01:22:55.638 --> 01:22:58.739
Everybody hang on! This is it!

01:23:06.715 --> 01:23:08.248
Looks like they didn't make it
sir.

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.417
Well we better check it out.

01:23:10.419 --> 01:23:12.119
Sir.

01:23:12.121 --> 01:23:16.256
Listen man. If half and hour
is gonna save the life of that

01:23:16.258 --> 01:23:17.758
Family that's what
I'm going to do.

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:20.995
Sir. You have 25 minutes
exactly.

01:23:20.997 --> 01:23:22.997
Captain.

01:23:22.999 --> 01:23:24.688
Cornel dillard, you know
where I got my orders.

01:23:24.701 --> 01:23:26.400
Look, I wish you got speed sir.
But

01:23:26.402 --> 01:23:29.770
In 26 minutes we will be airborne
with or without you sir.

01:23:29.772 --> 01:23:32.239
You'll do what you have to do
captain.

01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:37.778
But just bet in mind, that could
be your family out there.

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:41.915
Right. I need volunteers.

01:23:43.818 --> 01:23:45.753
Good lads. Come on.

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:51.759
Hold it.

01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.564
Alright. Double time.

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:09.977
Anyone alive?

01:24:09.979 --> 01:24:10.944
ralph is that you?

01:24:10.946 --> 01:24:12.346
Quick! Get them out.

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:13.947
Steve hang on.

01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.351
Get it outta the way.

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:24.992
You alright?

01:24:28.930 --> 01:24:31.098
sorry I'm late buddy.

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:34.802
I see your flying had improved.

01:24:34.804 --> 01:24:36.036
I learned from the best sir.

01:24:36.038 --> 01:24:38.072
You can't count either.

01:24:38.873 --> 01:24:40.274
She's with me. You got room
don't you?

01:24:40.276 --> 01:24:42.142
Yes we got room come on.

01:24:42.144 --> 01:24:44.244
They're waiting for us. Quick as
you can.

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:51.919
Oh my god.
They actually made it.

01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:56.523
Yeah, I think better run that
pre flight check one more time.

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:58.692
Just to make sure.

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:01.361
How's school taryn?

01:25:01.363 --> 01:25:03.564
Ah yeah I've been meaning to
talk to you about that dad.
