IDIOT MUST HAVE FORGOTTEN

POTEET GOES TO THE HOSPITAL
AND PICKS A LOCK?

30:40.089 --> 30:43.001

NIGHTHORSE TO RIDGES' CRIMES.

THAT THE LAST DOG SOLDIER
IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY

FOUGHT HIS LAST BATTLE
NEAR COPLEY FLATS.

SURROUNDED THEM.

THEY WILL TAKE DAVID.

33:45.983 --> 33:47.564

BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT,

33:48.194 --> 33:50.606
I HAVE A CONFESSION
OF MY OWN TO MAKE.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.691
HENRY'S NOT MAKING
A STATEMENT.

WHY ARE WE HERE,
MISS LONGMIRE?

34:00.039 --> 34:01.495
TWO WEEKS AGO,
MR. SLOAN SAID

34:01.665 --> 34:04.042
THAT HE WOULD TAKE
THE DEATH PENALTY OFF THE TABLE

34:04.210 --> 34:05.495
IF MY CLIENT
PLED GUILTY.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.920
I'D LIKE TO MAKE
A COUNTER OFFER.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.293
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT
TERRIBLY EXPERIENCED,

34:08.464 --> 34:10.921
BUT WE'RE NOT INTERESTED
IN ANY COUNTER OFFER.

34:11.091 --> 34:12.297
I LISTENED TO YOUR OFFER.

34:12.468 --> 34:13.583

IS LISTEN TO HERS.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.003

34:18.182 --> 34:20.844
WE WILL SIGN A BINDING AGREEMENT
RIGHT HERE,

STATING THAT WE WILL NOT BRING
A CIVIL SUIT AGAINST YOUR OFFICE

IN THIS CASE,

IS SO CLOSE

TO STICK.

34:58.597 --> 35:00.303
NO TOILET PAPER
IN THIS CASE.

35:00.975 --> 35:05.344

VICTIM'S MOUTH AND, IN FACT,

35:05.563 --> 35:07.645

SEARCH WARRANT.

35:07.856 --> 35:11.519
A PIECE OF RANDOM GARBAGE

35:11.694 --> 35:14.310

36:01.702 --> 36:06.116

THE FINGERNAILS OF MR. BECK

WILL WRITE STORIES ABOUT IT,

36:34.401 --> 36:36.141
