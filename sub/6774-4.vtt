     <i> My name is liv moore,</i>
     <i> and i died, sort of.</i>

00:03.804 --> 00:06.271
    <i> I had a promising career</i>
    <i> and a great fiance.</i>

00:06.273 --> 00:09.508
 <i> Then i went to the world's</i>
 <i> worst boat party</i>
 <i> and got turned into a zombie.</i>

00:09.510 --> 00:11.610
    <i> Now i work at the morgue</i>
    <i> for access to brains,</i>

00:11.612 --> 00:13.545
       <i> But brain eating</i>
       <i> has side effects.</i>

00:13.547 --> 00:15.314
     <i> I take on the victim's</i>
     <i> personality traits</i>

00:15.316 --> 00:18.117
  <i> And have visions which i use</i>
  <i> to help solve their murders.</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:20.285
    <i> I work with a detective</i>
    <i> who thinks i'm a psychic</i>

   <i> Jerome's roommate,</i>
   <i> eddie cisco,</i>
   <i> disappeared four days ago.</i>

00:33.634 --> 00:35.801
 All right.
 I'm gonna walk this over
 to missing persons right now.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.403
          Nice kicks.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.438
    Have you seen my friend?

00:39.440 --> 00:40.706
    Brother, i just saw him.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.441
      Blaine: <i> We'll have you</i>
     <i> to him in no time.</i>

00:42.443 --> 00:43.609
         What the hell?

00:43.611 --> 00:44.676
        You need to go.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.912
    For a mere 25k a month,

00:46.914 --> 00:50.449
    I've got the brains
    you need to keep
    all your pistons firing.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.593
   Time to look alive, baby.

01:04.098 --> 01:06.532
        So, last night,

01:06.534 --> 01:08.834
   Is that a service you
   provide all your clients?

01:08.836 --> 01:10.436
       What do you think?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.938
     I think i'm paying you
     25 grand a month
     to keep me in brains.

01:12.940 --> 01:15.307
 So, answering your booty call
 should get me a rebate.

01:16.277 --> 01:20.079
      Oh, jackie.
      I made you a zombie.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.014
       But i would never
       make you a whore.

01:24.285 --> 01:26.919
    Liv: <i> Finding that special</i>
   <i> someone is never easy.</i>

01:28.656 --> 01:30.756
  <i> Not just someone who</i>
  <i> gets you through the night.</i>

01:30.758 --> 01:33.325
      (rock music playing)

02:13.134 --> 02:16.935
      <i> And love in the time</i>
      <i> of zombie-ism, well,</i>
       <i> that's even harder.</i>

02:18.172 --> 02:19.438
        (doorbell rings)

02:32.286 --> 02:33.552
              Liv!

02:33.554 --> 02:36.722
   Hey. I thought jesse
   locked himself out again.

02:36.724 --> 02:38.991
      Is this a bad time?

02:38.993 --> 02:41.860
 I just got out of the shower.
 You know, getting ready
 for the day.

02:41.862 --> 02:45.430
    Well, i won't keep you.
    I just came to say hi.

02:45.432 --> 02:47.633
   And apologize for
   all the weirdness lately.

02:47.635 --> 02:50.269
       And, fancy coffee?

02:50.271 --> 02:51.937
  Oh. (stutters) that's for me?

02:51.939 --> 02:55.841
    I usually wait a couple
    of hours till i drink
    my second giant cup.

02:55.843 --> 02:57.109
          Oh, thanks.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.444
       That's whack, yo.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.749
        I take it jesse
        didn't work out.

03:03.751 --> 03:07.219
   Not so much. That's
   the last time i ever find
   a roommate on craigslist.

03:07.221 --> 03:09.621
 I can't live with someone who
 starts every sentence with,

03:09.623 --> 03:12.457
  "hey, yo, trip," and always
  thinks i'm frontin'.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.094
       -(clears throat)
       -jesse: Weak, man.

03:17.031 --> 03:18.230
            Sheesh!

03:18.232 --> 03:20.165
      Jesse really insists
      on a lot of bass.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.035
      I'm so sorry, major.

03:23.037 --> 03:24.636
      The only reason you
      even need a roommate

03:24.638 --> 03:27.206
  Is because
  i was supposed to be paying
  half the rent by now.

03:27.208 --> 03:28.674
        Liv, it's fine.

03:28.676 --> 03:29.908
  You know,
  i'll find another roommate.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.944
   And, uh... Thank you
   very much for the coffee.

03:31.946 --> 03:35.480
  Hey, did that eddie kid
  turn back up at the shelter?

03:35.482 --> 03:37.816
  No, uh, he's still missing.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.752
 And now jerome hasn't been
 around for a couple days, so,

03:40.754 --> 03:42.421
      I'm kind of freaked
      out about that.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.057
   I mean, he's returned
   my texts but i don't think
   he's coming back

03:45.059 --> 03:46.525
       Until he finds...

03:46.894 --> 03:47.960
              Hey.

03:54.501 --> 03:56.568
      (theme song playing)

04:22.196 --> 04:23.395
          You're up.

04:23.397 --> 04:26.431
     (nervously)
     you should meet liv.

04:28.335 --> 04:31.703
        Oh, right. Hi.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.071
   Uh, liv, this is corinne.

04:34.441 --> 04:38.377
 Hey, hi. So nice to meet you.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.745
        Yeah, likewise.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.781
  Oh. You went to udub, too?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.517
    No, i went to stanford.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.918
       Stanford's great.

04:47.921 --> 04:49.221
      Nice, good school.

04:51.258 --> 04:55.027
  Okay, well, i'm just gonna
  take off but it's so nice
  to see you both.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.967
       Liv: <i> Actually,</i>
      <i> it wasn't that bad.</i>

05:01.969 --> 05:03.969
  In the sense that it
  could have been much worse.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.606
  Right. I might have cried,
  for instance. Or thrown up.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.107
     Or grabbed that mug,

05:09.109 --> 05:11.343
   Which happened to be
   my very favorite morning
   coffee mug

05:11.345 --> 05:13.312
 When major and i were together

05:13.314 --> 05:15.981
 And shattered it in a
 million pieces like my heart.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.216
  And then forced her to walk
  barefoot across the shards.

05:18.218 --> 05:20.419
         Exactly, but,

05:20.421 --> 05:22.220
   I didn't do any of that.

05:22.222 --> 05:24.356
      If major and i
      are to be friends,

05:24.358 --> 05:27.492
    I have to be able
    to handle these things,
    be mature. And i was.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.528
 Well, i'm glad you survived.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.063
       Sadly, our latest
       john doe here

05:31.065 --> 05:33.865
    Won't be, uh, handling
    much of anything.

05:33.867 --> 05:36.234
 The lack of bleeding indicates
 they were removed post-mortem?

05:36.236 --> 05:40.238
   Hmm. As were the molars.

05:40.240 --> 05:42.874
   Suggesting both were done
   to make the body
   more difficult to id.

05:42.876 --> 05:43.975
    I've seen this before.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.877
     Typically with asian
     gangland murders.

05:45.879 --> 05:49.081
 Which would also be
 consistent with his gang tat.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.483
   He's been a member
   of the blue cobras
   for five to seven years,

05:51.485 --> 05:54.152
    Based on the sub-dermal
    dispersion of the ink.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.588
       "cause of death,
       hemorrhagic shock

05:56.590 --> 05:59.458
 "due to excessive
 internal bleeding, as a result
 of multiple contusions

05:59.460 --> 06:00.826
     "and severe
     deep-muscle trauma."

06:00.828 --> 06:02.894
       Well, based on
       the abdominal
       bruising pattern,

06:02.896 --> 06:04.062
       I'd say he was
       kicked to death.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.398
    It's a "boot party,"
    i believe they call it.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.467
    I'm guessing clive
    would appreciate
    your help on this one.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.602
    You might want to take
    a, uh, working lunch.

06:14.174 --> 06:18.009
  Liv: <i> Hiding your true self</i>

 a dude's skull.

        -This is rad.

      do the gnarly stuff.

06:38.298 --> 06:39.664
      And you're not
      about to. (chuckles)

06:40.367 --> 06:43.168
   Oh, right, the spare key.

06:43.170 --> 06:45.036
  Remember, you got to turn it
  and jiggle.

06:45.038 --> 06:47.038
  Thanks again for letting
  me crash with you for a few.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.573
   Mom's in one of her moods?

06:48.575 --> 06:52.244
   You mean
   the 16-year mood where
   she rides my ass nonstop?

06:52.246 --> 06:53.545
     Four a's and two b's.

06:53.547 --> 06:54.746
       I understand that
       in many homes

06:54.748 --> 06:56.081
       That's considered
       a pat-on-the-back,

06:56.083 --> 06:57.716
     Frame-the-report-card
     achievement.

06:57.718 --> 07:00.919

  my apartment's
  in a dead cell zone.

     the perfect time,

     conference in spokane.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.160
        By the way,
        she totally knew

07:08.162 --> 07:10.095
    You'd been in her room
    last time you came over.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.296
   Her stuff had been moved.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.031
     She thought you'd
     even slept in her bed.

07:13.033 --> 07:16.101
     All i did was try
     her personal massager.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.502
   I could never work out
   the kinks in my shoulders,

07:17.504 --> 07:20.038
        So, maybe i was
        using it wrong.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.473
  Whoa, dude's got no fingers!

07:21.475 --> 07:23.675

07:44.832 --> 07:47.432
     Yeah, i'll never how
     you can eat down here.

 So, you two have already met.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.351
  It's sammy wong.
  What's left of him, anyway.

08:06.353 --> 08:07.819
      How do you know him?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.187
          Long story.

08:09.189 --> 08:12.123
 Okay then,
 any theories on who did this?

08:12.125 --> 08:16.094
     Might i suggest
     a disappointed former
     piano teacher?

08:16.096 --> 08:18.930
   Well, stay out of it.
   I can handle this without
   your psychic powers.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.832
    -I'd like to help if...
    -Stay out of it.

08:23.270 --> 08:26.338
     Who you been
     talking to, ray! Hmm?

08:26.340 --> 08:28.807
            (grunts)

08:28.809 --> 08:30.675
     You been chatty, boy?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.313
     Sammy: Come on, clive.
     Ray's cool.

08:36.316 --> 08:39.150
       I told you, sammy!
       Stay out of it
       or you're up next!

08:43.789 --> 08:44.856
      What'd you just see?

08:45.893 --> 08:48.093
     Nothing. Not a thing.

09:05.279 --> 09:07.712
    You're telling me back
    when clive worked vice,

09:07.714 --> 09:09.381
       He had a mustache?

09:09.383 --> 09:12.150
   Facial hair isn't exactly
   the headline here, ravi.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.052
     I saw clive giving
     a rodney king-quality

09:14.054 --> 09:16.922
   Beat-down to
   some guy named ray,
   accusing him of snitching.

09:16.924 --> 09:18.456
     -Snitching about what?
     -No idea.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.392
    But he threatened our
    fingerless friend, too.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.694
  Sammy was there. I saw him.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.397
   No wonder clive doesn't
   want my help on this case.
   He's a dirty cop.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.499
     Whoa, liv, slow down.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.901
      Look, what you saw
      is a bit unsettling,

09:29.903 --> 09:32.103
       But let's not jump
       to conclusions.
       You know clive.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.906
     But do i? Do i really?
     You're right.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.175
      -There's probably
      another explanation.
      -Yes.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.643
 Just like there is for seeing
 this chick corinne

09:38.645 --> 09:39.911
 In major's house at 8:00 a.M.,

09:39.913 --> 09:42.213
  Wearing his shirt,
  slobbering all over my cup.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.015
    Actually, that
    doesn't seem to beg
    for another explanation.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.751
   Why didn't i see it?
   She's angling to move in.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.987
 "i'll share the rent with you,
 major. I'll share everything."

09:48.989 --> 09:50.155
             Slut.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.489
       Major's spare room
       is barely cold

09:51.491 --> 09:53.825
  And there she was, hovering.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.193
  Major loves a thumping bass.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.661
 I'll bet that she was the one
 with the delicate ears.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.030
    Liv, listen to yourself.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.066
    They've only been seeing
    each other for a couple
    of weeks.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.500
       You're sounding
       a little paranoid.

10:02.502 --> 10:03.969
  Oh, you're on her side now?

10:03.971 --> 10:06.838
    No. I'm just saying
    you've had a pretty
    radical change of heart

10:06.840 --> 10:08.840
      Since you ate lunch.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.842
       Or should i say,
       "change of head."

10:10.844 --> 10:11.977
  You are who you eat, right?

10:11.979 --> 10:13.578
      You don't just
      have their visions,

10:13.580 --> 10:15.880
   You also get some of their
   personality traits.

10:15.882 --> 10:17.349
    It's possible sammy here

10:17.351 --> 10:20.151
    Had an anxious,
    fearful thought process,

10:20.153 --> 10:22.387
  With bouts of irrationality
  and delusion.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.489
      You're right.
      Let's not freak out.

10:24.491 --> 10:26.224
   It's too soon for corinne
   to move in with major.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.226
  He's too fragile right now.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.761
      -She's his rebound.
      -(pen clicks)

10:29.763 --> 10:31.429
     -Hmm.
     -That's why you should
     move in with him

10:31.431 --> 10:33.365
 And head her off at the pass.

10:33.367 --> 10:35.567
    -Me?
    -He needs a house-mate.

10:35.569 --> 10:37.102
     I think you two would
     really hit it off.

10:37.104 --> 10:40.305
     Uh, i'm not looking to
     give up my privacy,
     which i enjoy.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.141
   You'd have your own room.
   And bathroom.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.644
    How much more "privacy"
    do you need?

10:45.646 --> 10:47.379
   What sort of
   perversions are you into?

10:47.381 --> 10:49.748
   I also don't want to
   lock myself into a lease.

10:49.750 --> 10:50.949
       Ever since
       the cdc sacked me

10:50.951 --> 10:53.718
  With no notice,
  week-to-week is how i roll.

10:53.720 --> 10:56.354
   So, to sum it up,
   satisfied with my
   current living situation,

10:56.356 --> 10:59.791
  Concerned with your paranoia
  with regards to both
  major and clive.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.893
   Duly noted. But remember,

11:01.895 --> 11:04.195
 Just because i'm paranoid
 doesn't mean there's not some

11:04.197 --> 11:06.064
      Strange stuff
      going on out there.

11:18.545 --> 11:20.712
       Ah, <i> grazie, bella.</i>

11:20.714 --> 11:23.682
       Nice fake bake,
       donatella versace.

11:23.684 --> 11:25.417
      How do you get yours
      to come out so even?

11:25.419 --> 11:27.819
    By sleeping with someone
    who's got her own
    private aesthetician.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.122
        Did my two sides
        of beef come in?

11:31.124 --> 11:32.223
          In the back.

11:40.701 --> 11:41.766
       Oh, morning, boss.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.804
      I need you two
      on deliveries today.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.338
     Do you think you can
     handle that this time?

11:47.340 --> 11:49.074
       Yeah, from now on
       we're each typing

11:49.076 --> 11:50.675
        Every address
        into our phones.

11:50.677 --> 11:52.811
      That mix-up
      won't happen again.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.413
   Well, it definitely won't
   happen a third time.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.349
      Here's today's list.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.417
         Any questions?

11:59.886 --> 12:00.952
          (door opens)

12:02.255 --> 12:05.323
      Don't startle them.
      They're thinking.

12:07.794 --> 12:09.327
    Nope. We're good to go.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.429
     I think my clients
     are going to like this
     latest creation.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.364
       Braised cerebellum
       a la grenoble.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.300
   Ah, that sounds expensive.

12:19.639 --> 12:20.905
     It tastes like money.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.741
             Uh-uh!

12:22.743 --> 12:26.644
  What are you looking at?
  Brains are for closers. Go.

12:27.547 --> 12:28.613
              Go.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.015
              Go.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.793
   Liv: <i> Vice.</i>
  <i> Clive's old stomping ground.</i>

12:44.364 --> 12:45.730
  <i> Why would anyone ever leave?</i>

12:45.732 --> 12:46.998
           Hey, doll.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.100
    -Cross-dresser: Oh! Hey!
    -Officer: Keep walking.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.907
       So, sammy's dead.

12:55.909 --> 12:59.010
      Hey, marty, did we
      have a dead pool
      going on sammy wong?

12:59.012 --> 13:00.445
    Not on that one, devore.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.680
         Hmm. No pool.

13:02.682 --> 13:05.850
      Then my reaction
      would be... Meh.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.619
 I guess there was a vice case.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.754
      Detective babineaux,
      he was your partner?

13:09.756 --> 13:11.489
  He identified sammy's body.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.925
 We're having a tough time
 getting any other information
 out of him.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.293
 I appreciate all the hard work

13:15.295 --> 13:16.661
      You must do down
      at the me's office,

13:16.663 --> 13:19.030
   But i still can't help you
   with a vice case.

13:19.032 --> 13:21.466
    -Not one that's ongoing.
    -It's ongoing, huh?

13:21.468 --> 13:24.002
    Well, is there anything
    more general that
    you could tell me?

13:24.004 --> 13:25.904
       You know, like,
       your experience
       working with clive

13:25.906 --> 13:28.673
    Or what he was like
    on a professional level?

13:28.675 --> 13:31.276
    I mean, just before i go
    too far down the road
    with this guy.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.415
   Well, i can tell you that
   he was always looking out
        for number one.

13:38.585 --> 13:41.452
 That he was a little too close
 to his cis.

13:41.454 --> 13:44.722
   That no one was surprised
   when he got suspended.

13:44.724 --> 13:48.092
 And when he left for homicide,
 no one was sorry
 to see him go.

13:48.094 --> 13:51.196
  He got suspended? For what?

13:51.198 --> 13:54.332
   Let's just say
   the thin blue line can get
   a lot thinner

13:54.334 --> 13:55.867
  When you're working in vice.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.241
 Why didn't clive ever tell us
 he'd been suspended?

14:03.243 --> 14:05.210
  Well, it's such a wonderful
  conversation starter.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.611
 You'd think he'd lead with it.

14:06.613 --> 14:08.847
 Then people would immediately
 begin assuming the worst.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.215
      I haven't been
      assuming the worst.

14:10.217 --> 14:12.183
   I see it in living,
   if somewhat blurry, color.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.452
    And it looks a lot like
    clive's a dirty cop.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.154
  Throwing around his muscle.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.755
 I mean, the guy he was
 beating up in front of sammy,

14:17.757 --> 14:19.924
      That ray character,

14:19.926 --> 14:22.694
  His shirt said
  hong kong video staff on it.

14:22.696 --> 14:25.730
    He could shed some light
    on clive's involvement
    in all this.

14:25.732 --> 14:27.398
       This is the place.

14:27.400 --> 14:28.900
 We need to get a better sense
 of who and what
 we're dealing with

14:28.902 --> 14:30.902
 Without raising any red flags.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.637
        Follow my lead.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.106
  Should i be concerned that
  whatever you're about to do
         requires gum?

14:41.681 --> 14:42.847
          Hey, there.

14:42.849 --> 14:44.549
     I was wondering
     if you could help me.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.984
 I'm looking for this guy ray?

14:47.120 --> 14:48.386
      How do you know ray?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.855
   I met him at a party.
   It was kind of a while ago

14:50.857 --> 14:52.490
    But we, like,
    hooked up, or whatever.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.059
     Do i sound so totally
     slutty right now?

14:55.061 --> 14:59.230
  Well, yeah... When don't you
  sound so totally slutty?

14:59.232 --> 15:01.266
          -Dude!
          -You asked.

15:01.268 --> 15:03.701
   Whatever.
   I was cleaning out my bag

15:03.703 --> 15:04.903
       And i found this.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.372
       And i had this
       drunken flashback

15:07.374 --> 15:08.673
       And remembered
       ray gave it to me.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.341
      So, i thought maybe
      he worked here.

15:10.343 --> 15:15.246
     Her life is, um, like
     the whorey version
     of that movie <i> memento.</i>

15:15.248 --> 15:17.682
     What? If you couldn't
     look back at the sexts
     from the night before,

15:17.684 --> 15:21.152
 We'd never know where
 you'd been or who you've done.

15:21.154 --> 15:22.587
        Here's the deal,

15:22.589 --> 15:23.988
       My friend melanie
       here has a thing

15:23.990 --> 15:26.124
     For men of the,
     uh, asian persuasion.

15:26.793 --> 15:28.426
         In a big way.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.428
   So, uh, if you could point
   her in the direction
   of this ray guy,

15:30.430 --> 15:31.829
      Maybe i can get
      the hell out of here

15:31.831 --> 15:33.398
    And get the lunch
    i thought i was getting.

15:33.400 --> 15:36.501
    Because this isn't me
    eating a tostada, is it?

15:40.140 --> 15:41.539
           Wait here.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.256
       That's one way
       to take a shower.

15:58.258 --> 16:00.458
  Your desire for privacy
  in your living arrangements

16:00.460 --> 16:02.493
      Is starting to come
      into sharper focus.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.797
    Oh, look. They actually
    have the whorey version
          of <i> memento.</i>

16:12.539 --> 16:14.906
      I swear, a.J.
      I didn't say a word!

16:14.908 --> 16:17.942
  -Are you sure? Not even one?
  -No. (whimpering)

16:17.944 --> 16:20.078
    Let's see if some wasabi
    jogs his memory.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.779
  -(screaming) oh, no, no, no!
  -Clive!

16:22.615 --> 16:24.315
        My man! (laughs)

16:25.318 --> 16:28.319
      You're just in time.
      We found our rat.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.254
       How could you
       think it was ray?

16:30.256 --> 16:31.856
           (laughing)

16:32.692 --> 16:34.392
            (gasps)

16:36.396 --> 16:39.430
      -What is it?
      -We need to go, now.

16:45.238 --> 16:47.572
 I hear you're looking for ray.

16:47.574 --> 16:49.974
       And that you're
       into asian dudes.

16:58.985 --> 17:01.386
   I'm a.J.,
   and i'm into white girls.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.722
      Really white girls.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.025
       You might just be
       my moby dick.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.426
   I didn't catch your name.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.996
            Melody.

17:11.998 --> 17:13.564
      You sure about that?

17:13.566 --> 17:16.200
       Please. It's been
       melody, melanie.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.403
    She even tried to get me
    to start calling her
    starfire last year,

17:18.405 --> 17:20.637
       But i drew a line.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.508
      So, how did you say
      you and my buddy ray
      know each other?

17:23.510 --> 17:25.742
    I don't really know him.
    We just met the once.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.712
       What do you want
       to see him about?

17:27.714 --> 17:29.414
      We just hit it off,
      that's all.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.250
   Trust me, you don't
   want to try and understand
   her thought process.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.553
  I'd just give her ray's
  number and, uh, say a little
  prayer for your buddy.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.921
   Well, it seems weird
   to me that a girl like you

17:36.923 --> 17:39.757
    Would have to track down
    a guy for a date.

17:39.759 --> 17:41.826
  And why would he give you
  the card to the video store

17:41.828 --> 17:43.127
 And not his cell phone number?

17:44.130 --> 17:45.430
       Maybe i should've
       taken the hint.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.532
      This was a bad idea.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.901
   Well, no. We're here now,
   i'm sure a.J. Here can

17:49.903 --> 17:51.335
   Hook you up with
   an e-mail address or a...

17:51.337 --> 17:54.005
     Nice ink, by the way.
     Is that a snake?

17:55.275 --> 17:56.407
         It's a cobra.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.577
    A blue cobra. Very cool.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.547
           Very cool.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.883
   Much cooler than if you
   chose, say, a puff adder.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.086
       Or a common krait.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.720
      Uh, i think you've
      embarrassed yourself

18:09.722 --> 18:11.055
     -Enough for one day.
     -(chuckles nervously)

18:11.057 --> 18:13.424
 Uh, we're gonna go away. Um...

18:14.661 --> 18:15.726
    Lovely store, gentlemen.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.798
 That's not just a shop renting
 more asian porn than i could
 possibly imagine.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.233
  It's like
  the blue cobras' clubhouse.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.168
     I had a vision when we
     were in the porn room.

18:24.170 --> 18:26.504
      That guy, a.J.?
      He's the main cobra.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.840
   He ordered one of his boys
   to stick wasabi in some
   other guy's eye

18:28.842 --> 18:30.374
      To make him confess
      to snitching.

18:30.376 --> 18:32.110
  Looks like the cobras
  are looking to plug a leak.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.311
 Clive showed up in the vision.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.114
     It sounded like clive
     had been helping a.J.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.815
       And this ray
       we're looking for,

18:37.817 --> 18:39.150
     The guy clive beat up?

18:39.152 --> 18:41.119
     It looked like he was
     a.J.'s best bud.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.587
          Bloody hell.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.926
       Okay, let's not
       presume too much.

18:48.928 --> 18:51.696
   A good cop investigating
   sammy's murder
   would logically come here.

18:51.698 --> 18:54.365
   So would a dirty cop
   reporting to his partners.

18:54.367 --> 18:57.301
     Clive is helping them
     ferret out a snitch.

18:57.303 --> 18:59.036
      Let's wait and see
      where he goes next.

19:03.576 --> 19:04.842
            Or not.

19:11.484 --> 19:14.952
 Do you realize you have like,
 zero junk food?

19:14.954 --> 19:17.321
      Although, who knows,
      there could be a bag
         of cheesy puffs

19:17.323 --> 19:19.624
       Buried in peyton's
       sports bra drawer.

19:19.626 --> 19:22.059
   I imagine she owns enough
   sports bras to warrant
   their own drawer.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.028
  You don't have to say
  it's true. Just cough twice.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.396
   Evan, come over here now.

19:25.398 --> 19:27.064
             What?

19:27.066 --> 19:28.499
       Does that guy look
       suspicious to you?

19:31.771 --> 19:35.206
    Now that you mention it,
    he is spending an awful
    long time by that bush,

19:35.208 --> 19:37.975
  -Waiting for his dog to pee.
  -I know, right?

19:37.977 --> 19:39.977
  Have you by any chance been
  taking advantage of our

19:39.979 --> 19:41.479
        State's liberal
        marijuana laws?

19:41.481 --> 19:44.882
     -No, why, have you?
     -Jeez, paranoid much?

19:44.884 --> 19:48.119
   Stay out of peyton's room
   and off drugs. I'm going
       to take a shower.

19:48.121 --> 19:49.587
  Let me know
  if you see anything unusual.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.223
    Especially with that guy
    and his so-called dog.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.428
            (sighs)

19:57.430 --> 20:01.032
 By the time we finish
 the rest of these deliveries
 the gym's going to be closed.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.935
 Yeah. I guess i could pop out
 the free-weights at home.

20:03.937 --> 20:05.469
  But it's just not the same.

20:05.471 --> 20:07.104
   I feed off the on-lookers,
   you know?

20:07.106 --> 20:08.706
       I hate this, man.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.641
   I miss my old life.
   I'm wasting my potential.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.411
     Why did blaine have to
     go and scratch us?
     I didn't ask for this.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.279
      -Neither did i.
      -Meanwhile,
      all blaine has to do

20:15.281 --> 20:17.381
   Is scratch rich dudes
   and create more customers

20:17.383 --> 20:18.816
     And charge them out
     their ass for brains,

20:18.818 --> 20:21.752
     Because he's
     the only game in town.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.689
    He's making money
    hand over fist with this
    awesome business model,

20:24.691 --> 20:28.125
 And we're out here
 working like a couple of
 frickin' pizza delivery boys.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.961
        Screw that guy.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.897
     You thought any more
     about what i told you?

20:32.899 --> 20:34.699
        Go into business
        for ourselves?

20:34.701 --> 20:36.934
    -He's not gonna like it.
    -No one likes losing.

20:36.936 --> 20:39.270
    But someone's got to be
    losing if someone else
          is winning.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.105
 That's just fricking science.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.174
     -What do i always say?
     -"you can't flex fat."

20:44.911 --> 20:47.845
  "the best way to predict
  the future is to create it."

20:47.847 --> 20:49.614
    Oh. Yeah. That is true.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.382
       It is true, dante.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.117
       There are no
       hand-outs in life.

20:53.119 --> 20:54.752
    There are no free rides.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.854
     You got to make things
     happen for yourself.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.290
  And when opportunity knocks,
  you can keep sitting
  on your futon

20:59.292 --> 21:01.259
        And watching
        <i> real homemakers</i>
        <i> of whoretown</i>

21:01.261 --> 21:02.727
     Like a fatty fat-ass,

21:02.729 --> 21:04.662
  Or you can answer the door.

21:05.832 --> 21:07.164
    I'm answering the door.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.867
 How would we even get started?

21:09.869 --> 21:14.071
     Dude! We already know
     where to find
     our first clients.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.907
        (both laughing)

21:18.578 --> 21:21.178
    What's the latest with
    mr. My-dog-needs-to-pee

21:21.180 --> 21:23.714
       At-the-exact-same
       time-every-night?

21:25.918 --> 21:27.251
         Evening, liv.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.530
  Evan, this is the detective
  i work with.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.165
        Clive babineaux.

21:41.167 --> 21:44.035
    Yeah, he said already.
    That's why i let him in.

21:44.037 --> 21:46.737
  Give us a minute, will you?
  You can hang out in my room.

21:49.942 --> 21:50.841
      I'll be in peyton's.

21:50.842 --> 21:51.741
   Why the hell were you
   talking to my old partner?

21:52.879 --> 21:54.445
    I was trying to help out
    with the case.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.547
  I thought i was very clear
  about not needing your help.

21:56.549 --> 21:59.116
  You were.
  I thought you could use
  someone to watch your back.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.419
      I have a feeling
      sammy ran with some
      really bad dudes.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.587
     What kind of feeling?

22:03.589 --> 22:06.223
  Have you been having
  one of your little hoodoo
  film festivals up in there?

22:06.225 --> 22:07.958
       No. I haven't had
       a single vision.

22:10.096 --> 22:12.730
 So you know,
 sammy wong was
 in federal witness protection.

22:13.433 --> 22:15.166
            He was?

22:15.168 --> 22:18.135
   I guess the feds
   didn't do such a good job
   on the protection part.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.837
   No, he was fine for
   six months in albuquerque,

22:19.839 --> 22:21.372
     But his dumb ass
     had to sneak back here

22:21.374 --> 22:22.873
    And visit his dying mom.

22:22.875 --> 22:26.043
 Look, there are higher forces
 at work here, liv.

22:27.280 --> 22:29.246
  If you don't stay out of it,

22:29.248 --> 22:30.815
     You're going to
     wind up getting hurt.

22:36.923 --> 22:39.490
       Hey. Ravi, right?

22:39.492 --> 22:41.359
 We, uh, kind of met last week.

22:41.361 --> 22:44.261
      Of course.
      Uh, liv's ex-fiance.

22:44.263 --> 22:46.931
          -Sorry.
          -It's fine.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.200
   Is that gonna be
   weird for you, by the way?

22:49.202 --> 22:50.801
   You being liv's ex-fiance?

22:50.803 --> 22:51.969
             Yeah.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.238
              No?

22:54.240 --> 22:56.807
     Are you sure?
     It seems like you're
     a little off about it.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.110
  Like that "no" kind of had
  a question mark at the end.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.313
       I'm pretty sure
       i'm okay with it.

23:02.315 --> 23:05.182
          Okay. Good?

23:07.019 --> 23:09.353
    So, liv's not here,
    she'll be back shortly.

23:09.355 --> 23:11.021
        Would you like
        to wait for her?

23:11.023 --> 23:13.057
   I don't... I don't really
   need to wait.

23:13.659 --> 23:15.126
             Okay.

23:15.128 --> 23:19.029
      Uh, i can for
      a couple of minutes,
      if you need me to.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.432
  Um, is now not a good time?

23:21.434 --> 23:24.101
    Do you need to finish up
    or something?

23:24.103 --> 23:26.570
     I'm sorry,
     this is an incredibly
     strange conversation.

23:26.572 --> 23:27.805
    Are you here to see liv?

23:27.807 --> 23:30.040
    No. I thought i was here
    to talk to you.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.275
             -Me?
             -Yep.

23:31.277 --> 23:33.144
     Uh, about the room
     that i'm renting out?

23:34.180 --> 23:35.546
           Of course.

23:35.548 --> 23:37.548
       Liv had said that
       you were looking
          for a place

23:37.550 --> 23:39.250
     And you wanted to meet
     to talk about it.

23:39.252 --> 23:41.152
    But maybe... Maybe
    i had the wrong person.

23:41.154 --> 23:42.853
      Are you not looking
      for a place?

23:42.855 --> 23:46.624
   I suppose i'm not
   "not" looking for a place.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.926
     Uh, my current
     situation isn't ideal.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.094
 You know, dodgy neighborhood.

23:50.096 --> 23:51.729
     Thin walls.
     Lots of noise issues.

23:51.731 --> 23:54.832
     Oh! I just had some
     noise issues myself,
     i get it. Believe me.

23:54.834 --> 23:57.101
   What's the point of having
   7.1 hd surround sound

23:57.103 --> 24:00.137
     If you can't use it
     without neighbors
     banging on your walls?

24:00.139 --> 24:04.742
 Look, i'm sure you've noticed
 my work situation isn't
 the liveliest.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.978
  When i unwind, i like some
  feel-it-in-your-bones audio.

24:08.381 --> 24:10.214
            (sighs)

24:12.885 --> 24:16.687
  I'm assuming at this price,
  the tip is included.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.389
    Talk to your boss
    if you have any problems
    with that.

24:19.425 --> 24:21.759
      It's kind of insult
      to injury, huh?

24:21.761 --> 24:23.394
 He turns you into
 a zombie and then charges you

24:23.396 --> 24:25.429
  An arm and a leg for brains.

24:25.431 --> 24:26.697
  Are you trying to be funny?

24:26.699 --> 24:28.866
         (chuckles) no.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.802
 I'm trying to tell you
 i have empathy for your cause.

24:31.804 --> 24:33.070
     Let me share something
     with you, jackie.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.907
    You know why blaine
    sets his prices so high?

24:36.909 --> 24:39.543
        -Because he can.
        -Because he...

24:39.545 --> 24:43.047
 Very good. We got a smart lady
 on our hands here, dante.

24:43.049 --> 24:46.484
   You see, blaine has
   what's called a monopoly.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.385
      He can sell brains
      at a sky-high price

24:48.387 --> 24:50.354
 Because he has no competition.

24:50.356 --> 24:52.423
   It's not like you're gonna
   go off on your own.

24:52.425 --> 24:54.425
    Start digging up graves
    or something.

24:54.427 --> 24:55.826
       Yeah, i'm not
       much of a digger.

24:55.828 --> 24:58.762
     Of course you're not.
     You're a classy lady.

24:58.764 --> 25:00.431
         And a victim.

25:00.433 --> 25:03.667
   And i'm here to tell you,
   it doesn't have
   to be that way.

25:03.669 --> 25:06.770
       -You have options.
       -Do i?

25:06.772 --> 25:10.474
    What if i told you there
    was an alternative
    to blaine's service?

25:10.476 --> 25:14.044
    High-quality brains
    at a fraction of what
    you're currently paying.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.015
  It would be nice to stick it
  to blaine and save
  a little cash.

25:20.820 --> 25:23.087
 You understand i'll need some
 time to think this through.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.688
           Of course.

25:24.690 --> 25:27.157
    I have to tell you,
    i admire your chutzpah.

25:27.159 --> 25:29.360
   I didn't peg you
   for the enterprising type.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.929
       Ah, that's because
       we're jacked.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.864
   People assume we're dumb.

25:33.866 --> 25:37.701
 But we're living proof
 that it doesn't take body fat
 to have a phat idea.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.806
 There's no way you have that.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.942
      Apparently there is,
      because i do.

25:44.944 --> 25:46.577
   How did you get your hands
   on a windforce?

25:46.579 --> 25:48.679
      Uh, what is that,
      like, uh, 1.2
      attacks per second?

25:49.148 --> 25:50.548
              1.4.

25:50.550 --> 25:53.017
 I thought i was so badass
 with my exalted orbit stones.

25:53.019 --> 25:55.319
      -Hey.
      -This is the most
      unbelievable kismet.

25:55.321 --> 25:57.488
      -It's crazy kismet.
      -Major is a level 66

25:57.490 --> 25:58.789
     Wizard in <i> diablo iii.</i>

25:58.791 --> 26:01.058
     Level 70 demon hunter.
     Right there.

26:01.060 --> 26:04.662
   Oh, you're going to lose
   your mind when you see it
      on a 4k ultra hdtv.

26:04.664 --> 26:06.964
  -Dude.
  -It's basically like having
  a holodeck.

26:06.966 --> 26:08.499
       So, this holodeck,
       are you thinking

26:08.501 --> 26:10.234
   It's an "in your bedroom"
   holodeck,

26:10.236 --> 26:12.603
     Or more of like a
     "communal living room"
     holodeck?

26:12.605 --> 26:15.940
  Bedroom. Unless you're
  okay with blackout curtains
  in your living area.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.408
     I am not a fan
     of gaming with glare.

26:17.410 --> 26:19.009
       Totally fine with
       blackout curtains.

26:19.011 --> 26:20.644
   So, wait, this is a thing?

26:20.646 --> 26:22.546
       You two are moving
       in together?

26:22.548 --> 26:24.548
  He had me at 4k ultra hdtv.

26:24.550 --> 26:27.718
  I'm surprisingly intrigued
      by the prospect of
  college football saturdays.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.320
         Lager. Wings.

26:29.322 --> 26:31.221
   Bow down to... Washington?

26:31.223 --> 26:32.756
    Yeah! You're getting it.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.458
   All right,
   i'm gonna get going.
   Um, give me a buzz later,

26:34.460 --> 26:35.793
 -We'll go over the logistics.
 -Will do.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.094
         Cool. See ya.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.331
  Clive showed up at my place.

26:40.333 --> 26:41.732
  He found out that
  i talked to his old partner.

26:41.734 --> 26:43.567
  He told me if i didn't stay
  out of the case,

26:43.569 --> 26:45.402
      -I could get hurt.
      -He threatened you?

26:45.404 --> 26:47.504
  Basically, yeah.
  And he seemed very concerned

26:47.506 --> 26:49.306
     With me having any
     case-related visions.

26:49.308 --> 26:50.641
    And you didn't tell him
    you already have?

26:50.643 --> 26:52.076
         Are you crazy?

26:52.078 --> 26:54.345
       I don't know if
       he believed me,
       but i played dumb.

26:54.347 --> 26:56.146
              Hmm.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.515
  See, before major showed up,
  i was going through some
  asian gang mug shots

26:58.517 --> 27:00.551
   And found our anthony jin.

27:00.553 --> 27:03.087
     A.J.'s father was head
     of the blue cobras

27:03.089 --> 27:05.990
     Until five months ago,
     when he was put away
     on conspiracy charges.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.491
          Five months.

27:07.493 --> 27:10.194
    That's just after clive
    claims the fbi moved
    sammy to albuquerque.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.629
  Wait? Sammy was in wit-sec?

27:11.631 --> 27:12.963
      Well, so clive says.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.865
    Even if it's true,
    that doesn't explain why

27:14.867 --> 27:18.736
 Clive was beating ray up
 or showing up for these
 torture sessions at cobra hq.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.838
     If sammy testified
     against a.J.'s father,

27:20.840 --> 27:23.774
  No wonder he was constantly
  looking over his shoulder.

27:23.776 --> 27:25.743
 But in the vision
 that i had in the video store,

27:25.745 --> 27:28.679
 A.J.'s cronies were torturing
 a different guy for that.

27:28.681 --> 27:31.615
 That must have been before
 sammy turned state's witness.

27:31.617 --> 27:33.684
   And then later, when sammy
   was dumb enough
   to leave albuquerque

27:33.686 --> 27:36.220
  For a visit, who better
  than a dirty cop like clive

27:36.222 --> 27:38.889
  To give a.J. The heads-up
  or maybe even to kill sammy?

27:38.891 --> 27:40.658
    I don't want
    to believe that's true.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.360
    Clive seemed surprised
    to discover sammy's body
    in the morgue.

27:43.362 --> 27:44.595
            (gasps)

27:44.597 --> 27:46.196
       See what that was?

27:46.198 --> 27:48.966
 That was me acting surprised.
 It's not that hard
 to pull off.

27:48.968 --> 27:51.602
        He might kill us
        if he finds out
        what we know.

27:51.604 --> 27:53.937
     That's why i brought
     this tracking device.

27:53.939 --> 27:55.539
       Clive's shift ends
       in 10 minutes.

27:55.541 --> 27:57.775
  I need you to be my lookout
  so i can attach this
  to his car.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.410
     Let's not do
     anything stupid, okay?

27:59.412 --> 28:01.779
        If clive is who
        you fear he is,

28:01.781 --> 28:03.647
 We need to think this through.

28:03.649 --> 28:06.083
   Let's sleep on it
   and tomorrow we'll decide
   the best course of action.

28:07.753 --> 28:10.554
       -Fine.
       -I'm serious, liv.

28:10.556 --> 28:12.956
 I said fine. See you tomorrow.

28:16.796 --> 28:19.530
        Liv: <i> Sorry, ravi,</i>
       <i> i'm doing this.</i>

28:19.532 --> 28:22.733
    <i> Even though i'm not sure</i>
    <i> i want to know</i>
    <i> where it might lead.</i>

28:33.079 --> 28:35.646
    <i> You are not crazy.</i>
    <i> You are not delusional.</i>

28:35.648 --> 28:37.748
           (panting)

28:38.250 --> 28:40.517
            (grunts)

28:40.519 --> 28:42.753
  -Woman 1: Are you all right?
  -Man: Wow, she got hit hard.

28:42.755 --> 28:43.821
     Woman 2: Hey, girlie.

28:46.125 --> 28:47.758
         (sammy groans)

28:49.862 --> 28:51.795
    Look on
    the bright side, sammy!

28:51.797 --> 28:53.530
        Your mom's going
        to outlive you.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.265
   Sammy: I got news for you.

28:55.267 --> 28:58.268
     You're all going down.
     Your pal ray is a cop.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.842
     -(gasps)
     -man 1: Are you okay?

29:06.178 --> 29:08.078
      Man 2: Are you hurt?

29:08.080 --> 29:10.581
 -Woman 1: Do you want us
 to call somebody?
 -Man 1: Here, let me help you.

29:12.752 --> 29:14.551
            (gasps)

29:15.755 --> 29:17.488
        I know kung fu.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.292
        I know kung fu.

29:28.501 --> 29:30.134
       I know that ray's
       an undercover cop,

29:30.136 --> 29:32.469
 And if he's not already dead,
 the cobras are going
 to kill him!

29:41.213 --> 29:42.579
 What the hell's going on, liv?

29:42.581 --> 29:44.281
     I just saw the moment
     sammy was killed.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.849
     A.J. And his crew were
     kicking him to death.

29:45.851 --> 29:48.051
     Ravi says they call it
     a "boot party."

29:48.053 --> 29:51.155
   Right before they finished
   the job, he told them that
   ray was an undercover cop.

29:51.157 --> 29:52.856
     Ray's burned? Damn it!

29:53.492 --> 29:54.691
    He was my partner, liv.

29:54.693 --> 29:56.260
     My real partner when
     i went deep undercover

29:56.262 --> 29:57.795
     Trying to take
     down the blue cobras.

29:57.797 --> 30:00.564
    Look, i lied about
    not having any visions.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.801
  I saw you
  beating up ray, clive.
  I saw you at the dvd store.

30:03.803 --> 30:06.069
   You were there
   when they were torturing
   some guy for information.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.106
    You thought i was dirty?
    That's what you thought?

30:09.108 --> 30:11.275
  I thought that
  you might have been
  working for the blue cobras.

30:11.277 --> 30:13.510
   Your former partner
   told me you got suspended.

30:13.512 --> 30:15.612
   Hey, it's babineaux.
   Put me through to devore.

30:15.614 --> 30:16.747
  We'll deal with this later.

30:17.349 --> 30:18.682
      We need to find ray.

30:20.953 --> 30:22.386
     The team will meet you
     at the hangar.

30:22.388 --> 30:26.190
    I'm guessing 20 minutes.
    Do nothing before
    your backup's there.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.458
   Okay, i'll see you there.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.327
      Ray's on his way
      back from five days
      in hong kong

30:30.329 --> 30:32.196
  With a shipment of utopium.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.832
  The cobras like to use
  a private airstrip outside
  snohomish to avoid customs.

30:34.834 --> 30:36.934
  It's gonna be close,
  but i think we can get there
  before he lands.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.570
     -Okay, let's go.
     -Not you-and-me "we."

30:39.572 --> 30:42.139
 Me, detective devore
 and a team from the gang unit.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.507
       You're going home.

30:50.549 --> 30:54.117
    Gnocchi stuffed with
    medulla oblongata
    in a fra diavolo sauce.

30:55.988 --> 30:58.355
    Fantastic. What is that,
    cream in there?

30:58.357 --> 31:01.959
     Pureed neural tissue.
     Gives it kind of a...
       A silky texture.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.026
         -Hmm.
         -(door opens)

31:04.096 --> 31:06.396
       Ah, they're back!

31:06.398 --> 31:08.866
  Look, guys, i know you think
  carbs are the enemy,

31:08.868 --> 31:10.367
       I know, but you
       need to try this.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.409
     Oh, man. This is good.

31:21.013 --> 31:22.846
  Are you making more of this?

31:22.848 --> 31:24.681
  This is definitely what
  i'm having on my cheat day.

31:24.683 --> 31:26.483
          -(laughing)
          -mmm.

31:27.620 --> 31:28.719
              Mmm.

31:30.189 --> 31:32.022
     Gonna do some
     painting in here, huh?

31:32.024 --> 31:34.324
    In a manner of speaking.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.026
 You come up with
 a name for your new start-up?

31:42.668 --> 31:43.934
       I wouldn't give it
       another thought.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.677
   It's no surprise, really.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.246
  -Most small businesses fail.
  -Yeah.

32:07.326 --> 32:11.728
  This is why we buy in bulk.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.831
       Remember, julien,
       i took you out
       of this freezer,

32:14.833 --> 32:16.333
   And i can put you back in.

32:17.002 --> 32:19.937
     Loyalty, it's job one.

32:25.611 --> 32:26.843
  Come on, pick up, pick up...

32:27.446 --> 32:28.979
      (cell phone ringing)

32:28.981 --> 32:30.781
      -Babineaux.
      -Liv: <i> You're there.</i>

32:30.783 --> 32:33.850
 Sorry about all the calls.
 I've been going crazy worrying
 about you and ray.

32:33.852 --> 32:36.753
   I've washed every piece
   of laundry in my building.

32:36.755 --> 32:38.355
  You can relax.
  The cavalry arrived in time.

32:38.357 --> 32:39.489
       You're both okay?

32:39.491 --> 32:40.924
    Ah, we're both enjoying
    the sight of a.J.'s crew

32:40.926 --> 32:42.993
     Spread-eagled
     on a black and white.

32:42.995 --> 32:45.429
     When they rolled up,
     we found enough heavy
     artillery in the trunk

32:45.431 --> 32:47.631
      To put them all away
      on weapons charges.

32:47.633 --> 32:49.800
      We also found
      three bloody teeth.

32:49.802 --> 32:53.236
   I'll bet you chowder
   at ivar's at least one
   of them belongs to sammy.

32:53.238 --> 32:55.439
     I think i owe you more
     than a bowl of soup.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.674
    I really messed up
    on this one.
    I should've trusted you.

32:57.676 --> 32:59.743
    Three times i told you
    to stay out of it, liv.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.611
   On two separate occasions.

33:01.613 --> 33:02.813
     <i> I just didn't want you</i>
     <i> to get a look</i>

33:02.815 --> 33:06.416
     At some of that
     dark crap in my past.

33:06.418 --> 33:09.786
      Your vision
      did save ray's life,
      i'll give you that.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.788
   Listen, clive, i just want
   to say how much i...

33:11.790 --> 33:14.257
 Listen, i can't talk about it
 right now, all right?

33:14.259 --> 33:17.728
 The cars are registered under
 a.J.'s name but he wasn't
 in the welcoming party.

33:17.730 --> 33:20.797
 We're gonna head over
 to the video store and arrest
 him for sammy's murder.

33:20.799 --> 33:23.133
 Okay, well, give him my love.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.872
         (door creaks)

33:33.612 --> 33:35.145
             Hello?

33:51.730 --> 33:52.863
            (gasps)

33:56.168 --> 33:57.501
   See, the look
   on your face tells me that

33:57.503 --> 34:00.437
   Maybe you're not really
   all that into asian guys.

34:00.439 --> 34:02.773
       What else you been
       lying about, cop?

34:11.050 --> 34:14.451
   One of my boys
   followed you from my store
   to the police station.

34:14.453 --> 34:17.286
  How long have you and ray
  been working together, cop?

34:22.594 --> 34:24.995
    You don't need
    to protect ray anymore.

34:24.996 --> 34:28.398
      He's dead.
      Right now, it's just
      you and me.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.467
  This just in from snohomish,

34:30.469 --> 34:32.702
  Ray is safe, and your boys
  are cuffed and spread-eagled

34:32.704 --> 34:35.672
    On the hood of
    a police cruiser.
    Here's another shocker.

34:36.275 --> 34:37.340
            (grunts)

34:47.351 --> 34:49.119
      I learned that from
      your boy sammy.

34:51.456 --> 34:53.556
          (both grunt)

35:16.014 --> 35:18.215
         (liv panting)

35:29.194 --> 35:30.494
          (door shuts)

35:31.797 --> 35:33.697
     Evan: Hey, sis!
     Did someone say pizza?

35:48.480 --> 35:50.080
            (grunts)

36:00.492 --> 36:02.592
               -(grunting)
               -oh, my god.

36:08.800 --> 36:10.200
              Liv?

36:10.202 --> 36:12.068
      (breathing heavily)

36:16.775 --> 36:20.110
  I have to say, you're a lot
  tougher than you look.

36:20.112 --> 36:21.811
      Guess i just landed
      a lucky punch.

36:22.681 --> 36:24.014
      What are you, lady?

36:24.016 --> 36:26.850
       Just a girl!
       You got your ass
       kicked by a girl.

36:26.852 --> 36:31.221
        -Get over it.
        -You're a freak.

36:31.223 --> 36:33.557
     I don't know how many
     take back the night
     self-defense seminars

36:33.559 --> 36:35.258
       They gave at your
       sorority house,

36:35.260 --> 36:37.460
    But i could pretty much
    take out batman with
    a spiral notebook

36:37.462 --> 36:38.995
     And a student id card.

36:38.997 --> 36:41.531
      How did you even
      get on a.J.'s radar
      in the first place?

36:41.533 --> 36:43.500
   I went to the video store,

36:43.502 --> 36:45.769
      Asked a bunch
      of stupid questions.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.671
  Right before you showed up,
  i now realize,

36:47.673 --> 36:53.176
 To investigate sammy's murder,
 not to get instructions from
 your gang overlord.

36:53.178 --> 36:57.714
 (sighs) that you'd even think
 i'd be on the same side as
 that twisted wannabe ninja...

36:57.716 --> 37:00.784
    Clive, i know it's
    hard to understand,
    but it's not like i just

37:00.786 --> 37:02.886
 Heard a rumor and believed it.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.921
      These visions
      i get are powerful.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.924
      Seeing you that way,
      seeing you so cold
      and violent, it...

37:09.061 --> 37:10.827
         It scared me.

37:10.829 --> 37:14.497
    I lost a year of my life
    going undercover.

37:14.499 --> 37:16.366
    You know what it's like
    spending all that time

37:16.368 --> 37:18.435
     Pretending to be
     something you're not?

37:19.805 --> 37:22.339
       I can imagine
       it's pretty rough.

37:22.341 --> 37:25.842
     I didn't become a cop
     because i wanted to be
     one of the bad guys.

37:25.844 --> 37:28.144
   That so-called suspension
   devore told you about

37:28.146 --> 37:31.548
  Was supposed to get me
  on the inside
  of the cobras' inner circle.

37:31.550 --> 37:33.783
         Which it did.

37:33.785 --> 37:37.087
    But i went so deep that
    when i came back up,

37:37.856 --> 37:39.389
 No one wanted to work with me.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.491
      Not even my partner.

37:43.262 --> 37:45.829
     That's why they had
     to get me out of vice.

37:45.831 --> 37:47.564
   Thought i'd get
   a fresh start in homicide.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.734
      I'm so sorry, clive.

37:52.471 --> 37:55.405
   I know you're a good cop,
   i just...

37:55.407 --> 37:57.107
  I was being crazy paranoid.

37:58.610 --> 38:01.211
 Too bad those visions of yours
 don't come with footnotes.

38:03.181 --> 38:04.914
            So true.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.249
  If i ever have ever another

38:06.251 --> 38:09.386
    And you even
    show up jaywalking,
    i'll come to you first.

38:09.388 --> 38:11.855
      I'd appreciate that.

38:11.857 --> 38:14.057
   You going to be okay here?

38:14.059 --> 38:16.059
      I'll be fine.
      I've got my muscle.

38:16.061 --> 38:18.728
    Welcome back, detective.
    Care for a slice?

38:18.730 --> 38:20.697
    Got quite a choice here.

38:20.699 --> 38:24.301
 Pepperoni or double jalapeno.

38:25.937 --> 38:27.771
      That dude was right.
      She's a freak.

38:28.273 --> 38:29.973
         No, thank you.

38:31.710 --> 38:36.179
  If you see anyone suspicious
  who weighs more than
  50 pounds, you call me.

38:36.181 --> 38:38.114
     You won't always land
     that lucky punch.

38:38.116 --> 38:41.818
   Top secret, it was a kick
   to the nards.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.753
           (chuckles)

38:48.126 --> 38:50.994
  Liv: <i> I know it's not</i>
  <i> a different sun that came up</i>
  <i> this morning.</i>

38:50.996 --> 38:54.130
<i> But somehow, it looks sunnier.</i>

38:56.335 --> 38:58.201
     <i> Ravi is hitting it off</i>
     <i> with major,</i>

38:58.203 --> 39:02.205
  <i> Who seems willing to give me</i>
  <i> another shot at this</i>
  <i> friends thing.</i>

39:04.209 --> 39:07.110
    The "pretending
    to be something i'm not"
    isn't over,

39:07.112 --> 39:10.714
 <i> But at least sammy's brain</i>
 <i> is out of my system, finally.</i>

39:14.319 --> 39:16.720
    <i> I'm so ready</i>
    <i> to start looking forward</i>

39:16.722 --> 39:19.356
     <i> Instead of constantly</i>
     <i> watching my back.</i>

39:22.461 --> 39:24.527
<i> What's that old zombie saying?</i>

39:24.529 --> 39:27.831
     <i> Today is the first day</i>
     <i> of the rest of your</i>
     <i> half-dead life.</i>

39:32.337 --> 39:34.971
         -Say nothing.
         -About what?

39:37.008 --> 39:39.476
 I'm glad you got over your
 nerves about signing a lease.

39:39.478 --> 39:42.479
   Oh, no, there's no lease.
   Major didn't want one.

39:42.481 --> 39:45.648
      Really? He's usually
      a very by-the-book
      kind of guy.

39:47.619 --> 39:49.252
    It's obvious, isn't it?

39:49.254 --> 39:52.288
   He saw how eager you were
   to get me in here
   to block corinne.

39:52.290 --> 39:55.058
    He thinks you're sending
    a signal that you're
    not ready to let him go.

39:55.060 --> 39:57.193
  -I wasn't sending a signal.
  -You weren't?

39:58.530 --> 39:59.763
             Huh...

40:04.870 --> 40:07.070
     Hey, jackie, it's me.

40:07.072 --> 40:09.873
    Just want to
    let you know that
    thanks to your feedback,

40:09.875 --> 40:11.541
     Those two
     eager-beaver employees

40:11.543 --> 40:14.244
       Are no longer
       with the company.

40:14.246 --> 40:17.680
  I'm sending over a little
  sample of something special
  on the house,

40:17.682 --> 40:19.149
        As a thank you.

40:19.151 --> 40:21.684
  It's going to make you feel
  like a teenager again.

40:21.686 --> 40:24.954
  I suggest you have it before
  i see you tonight.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.489
         (phone beeps)

40:28.393 --> 40:30.393
     What about the shoes?

40:31.630 --> 40:34.063
         You a size 12?

40:34.065 --> 40:36.099
         -Be my guest.
         -(chuckles)

40:36.101 --> 40:38.234
       (cell phone dings)

40:48.580 --> 40:50.713
        -(shatters)
        -(clears throat)

40:53.885 --> 40:55.952
           (whirring)

40:55.954 --> 40:58.488
    Push him forward.
    Time to earn your keep.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.398
           (whirring)
