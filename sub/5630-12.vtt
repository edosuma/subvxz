Little went away for?

00:08.242 --> 00:11.343
Killed Gi-Gi Dicaro,
a shakedown artist

00:11.345 --> 00:13.779
from Bridgeport, right under
the 35th Street red line stop.

00:13.781 --> 00:16.615

dog you out like that

00:16.617 --> 00:18.317
about your wedding date
with Burgess?

00:18.319 --> 00:21.086

- Guy's like 6'6", 250, easy.

obviously.

to watch that fight.

they were cell mates.

on the payroll.

He usually does.

And how do I get paid?

00:47.748 --> 00:49.114

paid cash so that way

00:50.718 --> 00:52.317
you can't trace it
to a bank account.

00:52.319 --> 00:54.153

bank account, anyway.

if we're gonna get to Florida?

01:08.669 --> 01:09.802

01:12.172 --> 01:15.374

a CPD priority target

01:15.376 --> 01:16.675

01:16.677 --> 01:18.744
- Yeah, we went after him
hard when I was in Vice,

01:18.746 --> 01:20.579
but since he never laid
a finger on any dope,

01:20.581 --> 01:21.680
we could never grab him.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.682
- Remember that big
DEA bust last year?

01:23.684 --> 01:26.285
Caused a major cocaine
shortage in the city?

01:26.287 --> 01:30.089
Jensen is the guy who's
taking advantage of that.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.624
All right, you all know
Eddie Little, our new CI.

he was in for

01:39.366 --> 01:41.233

01:41.235 --> 01:44.336
Now he owns a string of
sports bars on the North Side.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.472
Sells watered-down liquor to
the college kids in front;

01:46.474 --> 01:49.374

product to the local dealers.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.743
- Which is who we're
gonna hit first.

01:51.745 --> 01:54.713
See, we bust the crews
that Jensen's supplying,

01:54.715 --> 01:56.815

under his operation.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.251
- If the city's dry,
how's he getting his coke?

01:59.253 --> 02:00.452
- He's got a connection.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.721
I mean, not Mexico,
not the cartels.

02:02.723 --> 02:03.755
Ireland.

02:03.757 --> 02:05.224
He's got an old
family contact.

02:05.226 --> 02:06.758
They roll it across
the Canadian border.

02:06.760 --> 02:09.193
- You know all of this how?

02:09.196 --> 02:11.163
- I just got paroled
three days ago.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.165
I guarantee you I know more
about that's going down

02:13.167 --> 02:14.700

anybody in this room.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.901

02:15.903 --> 02:19.304
First target is
the Lost Disciples.

02:19.306 --> 02:22.407
Eddie has intel this little
motorcycle gang is receiving

02:22.409 --> 02:24.676
a shipment of Jensen's coke
tonight at their clubhouse.

02:24.678 --> 02:25.811

the Lost Disciples' clubhouse.

02:42.429 --> 02:43.595

cell mate, right?

02:43.597 --> 02:45.230

02:45.232 --> 02:46.598
And he's fresh
out of Stateville,

02:46.600 --> 02:48.200

that would take

02:48.202 --> 02:50.335

02:50.337 --> 02:51.770

02:51.772 --> 02:53.172

had to take that guy down.

35:52.151 --> 35:55.252
- On your knees.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.827
[crunching]

36:08.566 --> 36:10.867
No hard feelings, bro.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.774
[gunshot, air hissing]

36:28.286 --> 36:29.920
- Hey, Eddie.

36:29.922 --> 36:32.222
Hands on the car.
Now.

36:44.235 --> 36:46.469
- No hard feelings, bro.

36:48.372 --> 36:49.873
- Just when I was
beginning to trust you.

36:49.875 --> 36:51.508
- Turn around.

36:53.578 --> 36:56.646
Get on your knees.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.615
- Hank, let's call
it even, huh?

36:58.617 --> 37:00.917
- Eddie...

37:00.919 --> 37:04.788
we were even at
4:00 this afternoon.

37:09.660 --> 37:11.394
Cuff him.

37:33.584 --> 37:35.518
- Had to take
the shot, bro.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.521
- Well, you're
a big-picture guy, Eddie.

37:38.523 --> 37:40.957
You were just never
strong on the details.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.892
- I leave that to you.

37:47.865 --> 37:50.567
- All right,
let's get this inventoried.

37:57.441 --> 37:59.943
- Great bust.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.279
Jensen's looking
at 20 years.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.648
- Not without
Eddie's help.

38:06.617 --> 38:09.319
I want to give the CI
money to his family.

38:09.321 --> 38:10.654
- They're not married.

38:10.656 --> 38:13.790
There's no way the state's
attorney would go for that.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.760
- It's the right
thing to do.

38:20.865 --> 38:23.300
- This history between you
two--must've been hard,

38:23.302 --> 38:25.869
bringing Little back
here in cuffs.

38:40.785 --> 38:43.053
We'll make an exception.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.831
- This is $80,000.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.400
It's 10% of the bust.

38:57.402 --> 38:59.736
It'll get you to Florida.

39:02.073 --> 39:05.675
- I never wanted
the money.

39:05.677 --> 39:08.478
I only wanted a life
with Eddie.

39:08.480 --> 39:10.613
- Mom.

39:10.615 --> 39:13.717
Eddie lied to you.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.785
And he was going
to leave us.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.021
- [sobs]

39:20.091 --> 39:22.692
- Take the money.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.828
Start over.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.881
Look, you have
my phone number.

39:44.883 --> 39:47.784
If you ever need anything,
you just call me.

39:49.086 --> 39:50.754
- Thanks.

40:17.815 --> 40:19.082
- Hey.

40:19.084 --> 40:20.683
Everyone's going
to Molly's.

40:20.685 --> 40:22.552
Meet up with some of
the fire cats from 51.

40:22.554 --> 40:24.421
You want to go?

40:24.423 --> 40:25.855
- I don't think so.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.824
- No?

40:27.826 --> 40:29.726
- [softly] No.

40:35.032 --> 40:37.434
- What's going on?
You okay?

40:40.438 --> 40:44.207
- You were never gonna
meet my mom, were you?

40:44.209 --> 40:45.475
'Cause you were afraid
if you did,

40:45.477 --> 40:47.143
the wedding would become real.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.879
- [sighs]

40:49.881 --> 40:51.648
Come on.

40:51.650 --> 40:54.017
Hey, where's this
coming from?

40:54.019 --> 40:56.186
- It's fine.

40:56.188 --> 40:58.154
I accept it now.

41:02.960 --> 41:05.862
You don't want to
be on the hook.

41:09.700 --> 41:12.135
I am letting you off.

41:13.737 --> 41:16.039
- Kim...
