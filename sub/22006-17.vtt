00:01.610 --> 00:03.680
Previously onSEAL Team...SaIim's business is

00:03.740 --> 00:04.957
doing favors
for powerful people.

00:05.000 --> 00:06.820
You have a relationship
with him?

00:06.870 --> 00:08.428
He'll talk to you. Salim
loves beautiful women.

00:08.480 --> 00:09.913
MANDY: I'm hoping
you can tell me something

00:09.960 --> 00:12.656
about the man who walked
our team into that house.

00:12.700 --> 00:15.442
My only thought is that he
may have been forced into it.

00:15.490 --> 00:18.789
Salim Hakan, commander of
the Afghan National Police.

00:18.840 --> 00:19.966
I think he's the guy

00:20.020 --> 00:21.089
who blackmailed Tariq into

00:21.150 --> 00:23.664
luring Echo Team
to their deaths.

00:23.710 --> 00:25.234
I can't share you anymore.

00:25.280 --> 00:27.271
I don't think
I should be your wife.

00:27.330 --> 00:28.752
Jason Hayes. I'm Amy.

00:28.810 --> 00:30.368
Nice to meet you, Amy.

00:30.420 --> 00:31.671
How'd you get past the gate?

00:31.720 --> 00:33.119
I was friends with Steve.

00:33.160 --> 00:35.151
Not that kind of friend.
Steve was married.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.943
I was gonna invite you over
to come and see my garden.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.900
In fact, ladies and gentlemen,
I believe it's no exaggeration

00:47.960 --> 00:49.734
to call the capture
of Musa Ghani

00:49.780 --> 00:52.954
themost significant blow
we've struck to date

00:53.000 --> 00:55.309
against the Afghan
heroin industry.

00:55.350 --> 00:56.954
This victory would not
have been possible

00:57.010 --> 00:59.877
without the full participation
of our Afghan partners,

00:59.920 --> 01:02.354
particularly
General Salim Hakan,

01:02.410 --> 01:05.664
commander of the National Police
for Nangahar Provmce.

01:05.710 --> 01:08.235
General Hakan.

01:10.240 --> 01:13.152
Thank you,
General Sullivan.

01:13.200 --> 01:14.849
Today...

01:14.900 --> 01:16.288
marks a true milestone

01:16.330 --> 01:19.413
in the history of my great
and troubled country...

01:19.470 --> 01:20.858
because the
elimination...

01:20.900 --> 01:22.765
You ever get the feeling
that we're witnessing

01:22.820 --> 01:26.256
the U.S.-led celebration of
what may be the most corrupt man

01:26.300 --> 01:28.609
in the most corrupt
country on Earth?

01:28.650 --> 01:30.424
If you were paying attention,

01:30.480 --> 01:33.119
you'd know it's not
a celebration of Salim Hakan...

01:33.180 --> 01:35.603
but of the successful capture
of Musa Ghani,

01:35.660 --> 01:37.082
who, until yesterday,

01:37.140 --> 01:41.042
was one of the most powerful
drug barons in this country.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.739
And thisis
what we must defeat.

01:43.790 --> 01:46.793
This is what feeds the monsters
that prey upon us.

01:46.840 --> 01:50.628
Any truth to the rumor that
he was also a DEA informant?

01:50.670 --> 01:53.844
I bear witness
to a new dawn in Afghanistan,

01:53.890 --> 01:56.620
a dawn of freedom
and prosperity,

01:56.680 --> 01:59.319
founded on our
unshakable alliance

01:59.380 --> 02:02.634
with the most powerful
democracy on Earth!

02:07.990 --> 02:11.994
Hey, you are athletic.

02:12.040 --> 02:13.860
You really are athletic.

02:13.910 --> 02:15.514
I'm trying to keep up.

02:15.570 --> 02:17.344
Uh-huh.Oh, my God.

02:17.390 --> 02:20.302
I am definitely gonna
have to clean up.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.876
That's Steve Porter's drill.

02:23.920 --> 02:25.785
Yes, it is.Yeah.

02:25.840 --> 02:27.922
That's a, that's a hand-cranked
coalminer's drill,

02:27.970 --> 02:29.926
his daddy gave it to him--
West Virginia.

02:29.970 --> 02:31.221
How did you recognize that?

02:31.280 --> 02:32.531
He gave that to you?

02:32.580 --> 02:33.831
Rest in peace.
Yes, he did.

02:33.890 --> 02:35.926
I thought you guys were
just friends.

02:35.980 --> 02:37.277
We were.

02:37.330 --> 02:38.365
Uh-huh.

02:38.410 --> 02:39.889
Ah. Okay.

02:39.940 --> 02:41.453
Why did he want you
to have that?

02:41.500 --> 02:43.456
He... he got something on it
during an op.

02:43.510 --> 02:46.024
Mm-hmm.And he asked me
ifI would take it in

02:46.070 --> 02:47.981
to have our labs test it.

02:48.030 --> 02:50.078
What'd the lab
have to say about it?

02:50.120 --> 02:52.202
Just had dirt on it.

02:52.250 --> 02:55.993
Why did he, uh, give it to you
guys and not the military lab?

02:56.040 --> 02:58.213
I never really thought about it.
I guess I figured he...

02:58.260 --> 03:00.990
he just knows
everything is better

03:01.050 --> 03:03.120
in the private
sector.
Yeah.

03:03.180 --> 03:04.522
I was meaning
to give it back to him.

03:04.570 --> 03:07.915
Then him and his
guys got wiped out.

03:07.970 --> 03:10.040
I don't really know
what to do with it.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.499
This is a joke, right?

03:16.540 --> 03:18.053
I get it.

03:18.110 --> 03:20.578
It's not a joke.We just took down

03:20.630 --> 03:22.973
DEA's best source
in all of Afghanistan

03:23.020 --> 03:25.159
only to find that
he's not our man.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.588
In fairness, the guy
that we took down

03:26.640 --> 03:28.414
is also an international
drug trafficker.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.280
And now you're
asking permission

03:30.340 --> 03:32.069
to go after Salim Hakan,

03:32.120 --> 03:34.168
the Afghan police commander
who happens, currently,

03:34.210 --> 03:37.509
to be the local face
of that cooperation.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.256
Any part of that
that I'm getting wrong?

03:40.300 --> 03:42.120
What do you want me to say?

03:42.170 --> 03:45.219
I know Salim's the _new
poster boy for our missmn here,

03:45.260 --> 03:46.955
but unfortunately,
he's also connected

03:47.000 --> 03:49.878
to the ambush and murder
of SIX American operators.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.968
That's what you said about
Musa Ghani, remember?

03:52.010 --> 03:53.875
"I don't care if he's
a DEA informant--

03:53.920 --> 03:56.878
the money on his field paid
for the murder of our guys."

03:56.930 --> 03:58.181
It did.Except it wasn't

03:58.230 --> 04:00.016
his field anymore.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.271
How close are we to
knowmg who he sold It to?

04:05.330 --> 04:07.969
We're still trying to run down
who owns the holding company,

04:08.030 --> 04:10.191
but the state of record-keeping
in this country

04:10.250 --> 04:11.808
being what it is...

04:11.860 --> 04:14.897
Listen... you want to
go after Salim Hakan,

04:14.950 --> 04:17.418
you can't be even
a little bit wrong.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.938
The old men will bury you.

04:19.990 --> 04:23.255
That's assuming you even make
it out of this country alive.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.343
What?

04:26.390 --> 04:27.994
You believe me.

04:28.050 --> 04:30.996
About Salim.
You know he's our guy.

04:32.530 --> 04:35.260
Find out who owns
that poppy field.

04:48.370 --> 04:50.930
So you're saying
that I got to be celibate

04:50.980 --> 04:52.936
until these wounds heal up?

04:52.980 --> 04:56.370
All I'm saying, kemosabe,
is that chicks dig scars.

04:56.420 --> 04:58.729
SONNY:
Exactly.
Not wounds.

04:58.770 --> 04:59.816
I haven't met
a woman yet

04:59.860 --> 05:00.940
that likes to get blood
on her sheets.

05:00.990 --> 05:02.594
That is why right there
that you and I,

05:02.650 --> 05:05.039
we roll in different
social circles, my friend.Thank God.

05:05.080 --> 05:06.775
What we're saying is,
you at least need

05:06.820 --> 05:09.209
to let these things
scab over, man.So let me just get

05:09.260 --> 05:11.990
the record straight,
young Jedi.

05:12.050 --> 05:13.995
Sonny does not abstain
while he's on deployment.

05:14.050 --> 05:16.746
Come on, man, that's like
sitting at the buffet table

05:16.790 --> 05:19.258
with your jaw wired shut.DAVIS: Ew.

05:19.310 --> 05:21.187
Look, you guys got to be
at the TOC in five.

05:21.230 --> 05:23.186
We doing another
daylight hit?

05:23.230 --> 05:25.403
How about you get your ass
to the TOC in five,

05:25.450 --> 05:27.759
you can find out
for yourself.Well, you coming with us?

05:27.800 --> 05:29.665
I was gonna go put some
batteries in your night vision--

05:29.720 --> 05:31.585
is that okay
with you?

05:31.630 --> 05:33.450
Okay.
She told you.Thank you.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.058
Wow.

05:35.110 --> 05:38.068
So, if Ghani sold that
poppy field eight weeks ago,

05:38.120 --> 05:40.588
that means that the cash
we found on it last week...

05:40.640 --> 05:42.028
Wasn't his.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.116
Okay, so if the cash
wasn't Ghani's,

05:44.160 --> 05:46.685
and Ghani wasn't in charge
of the hit on our guys,

05:46.730 --> 05:48.550
then whoever is
IS out there

05:48.600 --> 05:50.909
and he's laughing
his ass off still.ERIC: Listen,

05:50.950 --> 05:53.384
Ghani is a bad guy--
he may not be the bad guy

05:53.440 --> 05:56.603
who killed our friends, but...
we should all be proud as hell

05:56.660 --> 05:59.049
to have taken him down.So what you're saying is

05:59.090 --> 06:00.648
last night's party was...

06:00.700 --> 06:03.351
a little premature.Look, Sonny, we'll earn it.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.925
Okay? Soon as we catch up
with the guy who did it.

06:05.970 --> 06:08.097
That's what we do--
earn it, right?

06:08.150 --> 06:10.926
Do we, uh, do we know
who Ghani sold the field to?

06:10.970 --> 06:12.710
KSR Holdings.

06:12.760 --> 06:15.103
They got holding companies
here in Afghanistan?

06:15.150 --> 06:16.492
They do.
What they don't have

06:16.550 --> 06:18.279
is searchable online databases.

06:18.330 --> 06:22.118
But luclq for me, I have an in
at the J-Bad Hall of Records.

06:22.160 --> 06:23.764
JASON:
Oh, you mean that reporter

06:23.810 --> 06:25.721
who's been sniffing around you.

06:27.340 --> 06:31.595
Turns out KSR Holdings
has been around for 20 years.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.254
Last six months,

06:33.300 --> 06:35.165
they've been buying up
other fields

06:35.220 --> 06:36.994
in the surrounding areas.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.382
Poppy field
gets torched,

06:38.440 --> 06:40.692
KSR buys the ashes on the cheap.

06:40.740 --> 06:43.482
Their holdings now stretch to
over several hundred hectares.

06:43.530 --> 06:45.395
CLAY: That's a lot
of real estate.

06:45.440 --> 06:47.044
SONNY: Yeah.
I mean, they might

06:47.100 --> 06:49.352
be trying just to build some
townhouses or something.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.129
Keep the HOA fees down.

06:51.190 --> 06:53.090
RAY: Either that,
or somebody's about to go big

06:53.150 --> 06:55.493
into the poppy business.Okay, not that this isn't
fascinating and all,

06:55.540 --> 06:57.269
but any chance that
your reporter friend

06:57.320 --> 06:59.800
can find out the guy

06:59.850 --> 07:01.192
who's behind
KSR Holdings?

07:01.240 --> 07:02.844
It's not a guy.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.845
KSR Holdings is owned

07:04.900 --> 07:06.242
by Permaz Hakan,

07:06.290 --> 07:08.417
Salim Hakan's first wife.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.119
RAY:
Wait, now hold on.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.628
Yesterday you thought Salim
was a cop on the take

07:12.690 --> 07:15.033
from whoever ordered the
Echo hit-- now you're saying

07:15.080 --> 07:17.514
you think he bankrolled
the whole thing?I'm saying I think

07:17.560 --> 07:20.120
we need to talk to his wife.

07:26.920 --> 07:29.525
Salim is worried that people
are gonna make a fuss

07:29.570 --> 07:32.130
about a police commander, what,
buying up burned-out land.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.839
So what does _he do?
He puts It

07:33.880 --> 07:36.485
in his wife's name.Same thing mob guys do
to dodge the taxman.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.496
Way the laws are in this
country, he doesn't even need

07:38.540 --> 07:40.053
to worry about her
double-crossing him.

07:40.110 --> 07:41.668
Anything she has
is his automatically.

07:41.720 --> 07:43.403
CLAY: All right, well,
that's it, then.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.416
I mean, if Salim's
wife owns a field,

07:45.460 --> 07:46.631
that means Salim
really owns It.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.500
That means he paid
for the Echo hit.

07:48.550 --> 07:49.505
It's not enough.

07:49.550 --> 07:51.336
Not enough for who?

07:51.380 --> 07:53.109
The DoD.

07:53.160 --> 07:55.685
Brass has a lot invested
In Salim.

07:55.730 --> 07:57.686
No way they're
gonna distance themselves

07:57.730 --> 08:00.255
just because his wife's name
is on some piece of paper.

08:00.300 --> 08:02.518
That's why it's so important
that we find her.

08:02.560 --> 08:04.608
Assuming she's alive.JASON: Even if she is,

08:04.650 --> 08:06.208
Salim's never gonna
let that happen.

08:06.260 --> 08:07.955
MANDY: I'm not sure he'd
have much to say about it.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.558
Nobody's seen Permaz in years.

08:09.610 --> 08:11.214
Word is she ran.

08:11.270 --> 08:12.305
Word say where?

08:12.360 --> 08:13.486
DAVIS:
Kind of dirt she has on him,

08:13.530 --> 08:15.657
I'd run far, far away.

08:15.710 --> 08:18.270
All right, so we ﬁnd her.Find a woman

08:18.320 --> 08:20.538
who's hiding in a country where
women are already invisible?

08:20.580 --> 08:22.275
Is her father alive?

08:22.320 --> 08:24.231
MANDY: Barely, from
what I understand.

08:24.280 --> 08:26.407
If anyone knows where she is,
it'll be him.

08:26.460 --> 08:28.542
Unless they had a falling out
because he married her off

08:28.590 --> 08:30.763
to Salim the psycho.This culture, no
matter how estranged

08:30.810 --> 08:33.540
they are, a father always
keeps tabs on his daughter.

08:33.600 --> 08:36.683
So he's trying to protect her?So he knows when to mourn her.

08:57.710 --> 08:59.519
All right, listen to me.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.740
Put it to him this way:
it'd be a lot better

09:00.800 --> 09:03.052
if we find his daughter
before Salim does.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.058
InshaHah.
InshaHah.
That's what he says.

09:12.110 --> 09:13.327
Yeah, because
it's God's will--

09:13.370 --> 09:14.849
I heard him the first six times.
Is he aware

09:14.900 --> 09:17.460
that Salim
wants his daughter dead?

09:19.600 --> 09:21.943
InshaHah.
JASON:
'TeH hhn,

09:21.990 --> 09:23.855
if my daughter was in danger...

09:23.910 --> 09:26.128
Mm-hmm.
...and someone came
to my house

09:26.170 --> 09:27.649
and said that
she was in trouble,

09:27.690 --> 09:30.648
I'd be man enough to accept that
because it's God's will.

09:30.700 --> 09:32.258
The heathen's
speaking God's will.

09:32.310 --> 09:34.039
He believes in fate; I believe
in getting things done.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.480
I don't like that look.

09:47.540 --> 09:48.620
JASON: Just give
him a second.

09:48.670 --> 09:49.921
His face gives me
the damn willies.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.971
Give him a second.

10:11.430 --> 10:13.034
Yes. Yeah.Yeah, what?

10:13.090 --> 10:14.899
Uh, so he says that...

10:14.960 --> 10:19.215
"When I was a wealthy man
with a large family...
Okay.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.658
"...it was Inshallah.

10:20.700 --> 10:23.965
"And when my daughter
married an evil man,

10:24.010 --> 10:25.659
"it was Inshallah.

10:25.710 --> 10:27.792
Now you will bring
her back to me."

10:27.840 --> 10:29.057
Where is she?

10:31.410 --> 10:33.366
JASON: I swear we will do
everything in our power

10:33.410 --> 10:34.365
to protect her.

10:38.110 --> 10:39.008
Hey.

10:48.120 --> 10:50.941
Yes. Yes, we'll bring
his daughter back to him. Yes.

10:50.990 --> 10:53.641
JASON:
InshaHah.

10:53.690 --> 10:55.817
Jamal Mazari. Human trafficker.

10:55.870 --> 10:58.646
Kidnaps little girls,
sells them to other dirtbags

10:58.700 --> 11:01.692
or ships 'em off in bulk
to jihadi soldiers in the field.

11:01.740 --> 11:04.391
And Salim's wife ran to
this guy for protection?

11:04.440 --> 11:05.691
That's what her daddy says.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.263
Heart wants what it wants.

11:07.310 --> 11:09.130
Heart's got nothing
to do with it.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.055
She ran to Mazari
because he's a Tajik warlord

11:11.100 --> 11:13.182
running a chunk
of the Panjshir Province.

11:13.230 --> 11:15.312
Yeah. He and Salim
would never be on the same side.

11:15.370 --> 11:17.361
JASON: Look, we found his wife.
Question is, how do we get

11:17.410 --> 11:19.719
to her
without Salim finding out?ERIC: Yeah, as soon as we put in

11:19.760 --> 11:21.716
the target package,
he gets the heads-up.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.024
Might even have enough time
to go get her himself

11:24.070 --> 11:25.765
while we're sitting around
waiting on approval.

11:25.810 --> 11:27.061
What if she's not our target?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.769
What do you mean?I mean, what if

11:28.810 --> 11:31.335
the goal of the op was just to
grab Mazari and then, well,

11:31.380 --> 11:34.599
Mrs. Salim just happens
to get rolled up with him?

11:35.690 --> 11:36.907
You think
Mazari's a big enough fish

11:36.950 --> 11:38.292
to get us a green light?

11:38.340 --> 11:41.218
There's one way to find out.

11:49.050 --> 11:51.006
Mazari's compound
is well guarded.

11:51.050 --> 11:54.053
Bad news is he's been expecting
to be hit for several years now,

11:54.100 --> 11:55.704
which is why
we have this.

11:55.750 --> 11:57.706
And his defenses
are pretty dug in.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.489
What's the good news?

11:59.540 --> 12:01.314
Good news...

12:01.370 --> 12:03.144
Anybody?Good news is
he's been expecting

12:03.200 --> 12:05.145
a hit for a couple years now,
so his guys

12:05.200 --> 12:06.929
are probably getting
pretty lazy.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.413
JASON: Look at that.
You get a case of beer.

12:08.460 --> 12:10.018
So, what are you thinking, Ray?
Helo infil?

12:10.070 --> 12:11.935
It's what I'm thinking.Right. Where?

12:11.990 --> 12:12.934
Three-klick offset
from the compound,

12:12.990 --> 12:14.810
patrol to the target
on foot.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.464
Take out his sentries
from the last cover

12:16.510 --> 12:17.556
and concealment
around here.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.908
Prepare to commence assault.

12:18.950 --> 12:21.032
Yeah, which brings us
to the fun part.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.900
Permaz Hakan.

12:22.950 --> 12:24.429
Salim's wife.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.038
DAVIS: Now, this photo's
about 20 years old,

12:26.090 --> 12:28.046
so I'm having our techs
do a digital aging.

12:28.090 --> 12:30.172
Might get a sense
of what she looks like now.

12:30.220 --> 12:32.359
_ Mazari lives
in the men's quarters here.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.095
Female staff is
in this building.

12:34.140 --> 12:38.099
And we believe this is where
they're keeping the prisoners

12:38.140 --> 12:39.789
until they put 'em up for sale.JASON: Okay, we're certain

12:39.840 --> 12:42.365
that Permaz lives in the,
uh, female staff quarters?

12:42.410 --> 12:44.184
We're certain
she's not in the men's.

12:44.240 --> 12:45.457
Gonna have to secure Mazari

12:45.500 --> 12:46.888
at the same time
we're searching for her.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.283
Ooh, triclq. Have to move fast.

12:49.330 --> 12:51.150
We always move fast.

13:02.390 --> 13:06.349
So, looks like my little
research trip panned out.

13:06.390 --> 13:08.210
What makes you say that?

13:08.260 --> 13:09.955
Your boys are spinning up
as we speak.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.126
Even if that were true,

13:11.180 --> 13:12.863
we do hits almost every night,
so...

13:12.920 --> 13:14.820
Yes, but I'm hearing

13:14.880 --> 13:17.348
this one is related to what you
got at the Hall of Records.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.051
Hearing from whom?A Marine Private
First Class

13:20.100 --> 13:21.829
Jane Doe.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.836
Possible that's not
her real name.

13:23.890 --> 13:27.576
And what do you give PFC Doe in
exchange for this information?

13:27.630 --> 13:29.882
Let's see, a private
first class only makes

13:29.930 --> 13:32.012
about $450 a week, so...

13:32.070 --> 13:36.109
Mm. Best to keep
these kinds of transactions

13:36.160 --> 13:37.855
purely professional.

13:38.900 --> 13:41.073
Why I thought I would...

13:41.120 --> 13:43.816
bring up that Jason Hayes
interview again.

13:43.860 --> 13:45.464
You don't have to. He'll do it.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.727
Thank you, Mandy.

13:47.780 --> 13:50.248
Really, really.
I-I appreciate that.

13:50.300 --> 13:53.178
And just so
we're clear,

13:53.220 --> 13:56.348
I always keep my transactions
professional.

13:57.530 --> 13:59.430
Even this one?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.965
Especially this one.

14:05.140 --> 14:08.189
Glad we got that
out of the way.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.972
Thank you for your help.

14:12.020 --> 14:14.193
You're welcome.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.544
Oh.

14:17.590 --> 14:21.196
Weird thing. So, my friend
over at the Hall of Records,

14:21.250 --> 14:23.206
he said another Westerner
came in there a few weeks ago

14:23.250 --> 14:25.115
asking about some
of the same land holdings.

14:25.160 --> 14:27.116
Another journalist?Probably.

14:27.170 --> 14:29.559
Maybe he's working
on an expos about

14:29.600 --> 14:32.865
CIA's involvement
in the Afghan heroin industry.

14:32.910 --> 14:36.641
Call it "The Phoenix Project
Didn't End With Vietnam."

14:36.700 --> 14:39.692
Why not "Phoenix Project
Rises From the Ashes"?

14:53.930 --> 14:55.181
Nice shooting, Tex.

14:55.240 --> 14:56.889
Yeah. Take some shots, Ray?

14:56.930 --> 14:59.626
Come on, man. You
know we don't play this game.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.409
Really? Just say
that to Willie O'Ree

15:01.460 --> 15:03.280
or my brother
Wayne Simmonds, huh?

15:03.330 --> 15:04.934
Doesn't count.
Brothers are Canadian.Canadian.

15:04.990 --> 15:07.072
Come on. Let's go.
Put the pads on, Ray.No. You know what?

15:07.120 --> 15:09.725
It's okay. I'm good. No, stop.Get in net, get in net.
Put 'em on.

15:09.770 --> 15:11.328
Stop playing. Don't. Don't.Put the pad on.

15:11.380 --> 15:13.029
You good, huh,
RayStop playing. I'm good.

15:13.080 --> 15:14.593
Really? Are you
good, Ray?
Yeah.

15:16.080 --> 15:18.036
I just noticed you didn't sleep
in our hooch last night.

15:18.090 --> 15:20.558
Oh!
You, uh, with
that contractor lady?

15:22.000 --> 15:24.264
Yeah.
Oh, that's what
this is all about.

15:24.310 --> 15:26.653
I see. Got a problem with that?

15:26.700 --> 15:30.261
No. No, actually,
I think it's a good thing.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.663
I mean, she seems
like a lot, but...

15:32.710 --> 15:34.405
maybe you could use "a lot"
right now.

15:35.490 --> 15:37.139
What's that mean, Ray?

15:37.190 --> 15:38.885
Well, we rolled up
the bombmaker, right?Yeah.

15:38.930 --> 15:41.148
We rolled up the hit team
that wired the house.Yeah.

15:41.200 --> 15:44.283
We rolled up the heroin kingpin
we thought funded the op.

15:44.330 --> 15:46.890
At what point do we decide
we got whatever justice there is

15:46.940 --> 15:49.158
to get for the Echo guys
and go back to trying to win

15:49.200 --> 15:50.337
the war they died fighting?

15:51.640 --> 15:54.291
The enemy tries to kill us,
we try to kill them.

15:54.340 --> 15:57.332
Damn straight.I'd just prefer you didn't seem
so eager to get there.

15:57.390 --> 15:58.687
You make it personal,

15:58.740 --> 16:00.423
it's gonna eat you up, brother.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.256
You telling me you don't want
to smoke the guys

16:03.310 --> 16:05.039
who took out Steve Porter
and Echo Team?

16:05.090 --> 16:06.250
Is that what you're saying?

16:06.310 --> 16:07.868
You know I do.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.911
I just want to make sure
that you don't want it so bad

16:09.960 --> 16:11.359
that you end up doing
something stupid,

16:11.400 --> 16:13.356
like chasing Ghani
and his bodyguard up that hill.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.356
I can't promise you
I'm never gonna do that again.

16:15.400 --> 16:17.095
But what I can promise you

16:17.150 --> 16:18.401
is next time I do something
like that,

16:18.450 --> 16:19.838
I won't bring you guys.

16:19.890 --> 16:22.188
We good

16:22.240 --> 16:23.184
You really got to ask?

16:25.500 --> 16:27.934
Hayes.

16:39.730 --> 16:41.288
ERIC:
Everybody's bickering!

16:41.340 --> 16:43.205
Everybody's bickering! It's
not solving anything! Listen up!

16:43.260 --> 16:44.602
Any way we can just tell 'em no?

16:44.650 --> 16:46.163
No. All right?
I already tried that.

16:46.220 --> 16:48.211
The DoD is standing firm.Eh.

16:48.260 --> 16:49.818
If we're gonna go
after the Al Capone

16:49.870 --> 16:52.430
of human trafﬁckers,
then it's gonna have to be

16:52.480 --> 16:55.222
a joint mission alongside
our local partners. Period.

16:55.270 --> 16:57.226
RAY: Well, I guess that answers
the question of whether Salim

16:57.270 --> 16:58.703
knew where his wife
was holed up.Exactly.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.183
Which is why he
sent his guys along.

17:00.230 --> 17:02.482
He probably figured out that
we were hitting the place.

17:02.540 --> 17:05.054
But to be fair, we don't know
that it's his guys.

17:05.110 --> 17:06.054
They're not cops?

17:06.110 --> 17:07.759
Afghan Army Special Forces.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.199
Oh.CLAY: Most of

17:09.240 --> 17:11.196
their Special Forces guys
are pretty solid dudes,

17:11.240 --> 17:12.548
from my experience.
But that doesn't mean

17:12.590 --> 17:14.239
that they haven't
been infiltrated yet.

17:14.290 --> 17:16.190
We'll vet 'em as best we can.

17:16.250 --> 17:18.024
Hold up, we're gonna
have people in here?

17:18.080 --> 17:21.072
Yeah. Commanding ofﬁcer,
couple aides.

17:21.120 --> 17:22.599
Got to assume
they're bent, too.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.129
So we cover up the board,

17:24.170 --> 17:26.252
anything related to Salim
and the wife.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.642
I'm on it.

17:27.690 --> 17:30.341
Hard to see how we take
Salim's wife off-target

17:30.390 --> 17:32.733
without them
noticing anything.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.827
That's why I suggested to
General Sullivan that the honor

17:35.880 --> 17:38.348
of taking down a heinous villain
such as Jamal Mazari

17:38.400 --> 17:41.221
should go to the Afghan fighters
themselves

17:43.060 --> 17:45.358
for bringing in
all the secondary targets.

17:46.890 --> 17:48.755
But if any of 'em
are Salim's guys,

17:48.800 --> 17:50.586
you know they're gonna go
after her first.

17:50.630 --> 17:51.756
Yeah, smoke her while
we're hitting the target,

17:51.800 --> 17:53.199
say she got hit
in the crossfire.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.107
Yeah. Question is, they
gonna try and smoke us, too?

17:59.900 --> 18:02.687
SONNY:
Here come our pals.

18:02.730 --> 18:05.984
Think that's a Lego.Lego man.

18:06.040 --> 18:07.985
Lieutenant Abu Nabi.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.429
ANASF. You are the master chief?Yeah. Hayes.

18:10.480 --> 18:12.778
You guys ready?Uh, yeah, we are prepared.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.253
Um...What's wrong?

18:15.310 --> 18:17.119
There's been a change.What do you mean
there's been a change?

18:17.180 --> 18:18.738
One of my men was called away.

18:18.790 --> 18:20.132
An emergency
in his family.

18:20.180 --> 18:23.229
_ _ That man
is his replacement.

18:23.270 --> 18:25.875
Is he one of your guys?I've never
seen him before.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.888
What's going on?Uh, well, got a new guy.
He's a replacement.

18:28.930 --> 18:30.886
SONNY: A replacement?Yeah.

18:30.930 --> 18:33.148
The hell you talking about?Okay. You know what,
Sonny, I got this.

18:33.190 --> 18:35.146
Tell him to come here, will you?

18:40.980 --> 18:42.936
JASON:
Who is he?

18:48.640 --> 18:50.164
His name is Asadi.

18:50.210 --> 18:51.381
He's a commando,
not Special Forces.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.295
Stationed in Kabul.
One year's serwce.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.160
JASON: One year's
service. Okay.

18:55.220 --> 18:57.347
This is the best you could do?

19:03.220 --> 19:04.653
He has family in Jalalabad.

19:04.700 --> 19:07.168
He was home visiting.
He was ordered to report.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.573
JASON:
Report, huh?

19:09.620 --> 19:12.350
Who ordered him

19:13.450 --> 19:14.530
He says his command,
of course.

19:14.580 --> 19:15.706
Tell him to _wait
over there, Will you?

19:16.850 --> 19:19.102
Excuse me.

19:19.150 --> 19:21.198
What do you think of this guy?

19:21.240 --> 19:23.105
Is any of it legit,
what he's saying?

19:23.160 --> 19:26.288
Yeah. I mean, best I could tell.It's bad enough we got to work

19:26.330 --> 19:28.286
with these guys. Now we got
to trust the new guy?

19:28.340 --> 19:31.207
I don't know, boss. He's
giving me bad juju right now.

19:31.250 --> 19:34.469
I'd bet my left nut
that's one of Salim's boys.

19:34.520 --> 19:36.602
Okay, listen, bottom line is,
what do you want to do?

19:36.650 --> 19:38.299
We gonna take him?
We gonna leave him?

19:38.350 --> 19:40.910
We leave him. A man
down, doesn't matter.

19:40.960 --> 19:43.087
Yeah, we can get this done
without these guys.

19:43.130 --> 19:45.519
That's-that's the point though,
man. If we want to do this,

19:45.570 --> 19:47.265
we got to take that guy with us.

19:47.310 --> 19:48.436
With the politics
and everything,

19:48.490 --> 19:49.434
it's necessary.

19:49.490 --> 19:51.355
So why don't we just scrap it?

19:51.400 --> 19:53.049
Well, if we scrap it,
then I think

19:53.100 --> 19:54.271
we're giving up
our best shot to get Salim.

19:54.320 --> 19:55.833
Do it another day.

19:55.890 --> 19:57.278
What other day?

20:00.800 --> 20:03.325
May I join?

20:03.370 --> 20:05.235
I'll speak frankly.

20:05.290 --> 20:07.190
I know you don't trust me.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.459
No.I don't particularly
trust you either.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.899
I don't trust anyone.
Even Army.

20:12.950 --> 20:15.555
Taliban are everywhere.Right. Fair enough.

20:15.600 --> 20:17.943
It would not be my choice
to bring someone unknown to me.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.514
But I've wanted
to free these women

20:19.560 --> 20:21.289
from Jamal Mazari for years.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.079
The government will not do it.

20:23.130 --> 20:25.519
Now you want him. So...

20:25.570 --> 20:27.526
this is the opportunity.

20:27.570 --> 20:29.299
To end the slavery.

20:29.350 --> 20:30.487
That soldier,

20:30.530 --> 20:32.259
I will watch him personally.

20:32.310 --> 20:33.789
You can trust me.

20:33.840 --> 20:35.444
You want me to trust you?

20:35.490 --> 20:36.832
Yes.

20:48.290 --> 20:50.508
Get on the bus.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.548
Hey.

20:53.600 --> 20:55.670
What'd you say
your name was again?Nabi.

20:55.730 --> 20:58.631
Nabi. All right,
listen here.

20:58.690 --> 21:02.205
Look, I don't intend
on getting blown up by

21:02.260 --> 21:05.297
Mr. Milk-Bone
right there.

21:05.350 --> 21:07.079
Things go sideways,

21:07.130 --> 21:10.122
you can trust
I'm coming for you.

21:23.710 --> 21:27.180
All right, Bravo and Alpha teams
are two minutes out.

21:31.370 --> 21:33.326
Uh, Major Rasul
would like to confirm

21:33.370 --> 21:36.282
that all efforts will be made
to keep Mazari's Victims safe.

21:36.330 --> 21:38.116
Of course, Major.

21:38.160 --> 21:40.116
We know Mazari keeps
the people he traffics

21:40.160 --> 21:43.243
in this barracks, which we
believe is lightly guarded.

21:43.300 --> 21:46.292
By the time your team has
taken the men's quarters,

21:46.340 --> 21:49.559
our teams will have secured
the women's quarters here.

21:49.610 --> 21:51.475
After that,
we'll tend to the prisoners.

21:51.520 --> 21:54.125
Thank you.

21:59.310 --> 22:01.221
Whenever you're ready,
Lieutenant Commander.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.447
Bravo 1, what's your status?

22:04.490 --> 22:05.707
JASON:
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

22:05.750 --> 22:08.366
We're moving to Matlock.

22:13.630 --> 22:15.803
Hey, weren't you
in that task force in Kabul

22:15.850 --> 22:17.238
a couple years back?

22:26.950 --> 22:28.850
RASUL:
What is that Matlock, Mannix,

22:28.910 --> 22:30.992
Rockford?

22:31.040 --> 22:33.031
They're prowords, sir.

22:33.090 --> 22:35.217
Mission codes.

22:35.260 --> 22:36.340
Each one stands for

22:36.390 --> 22:37.823
a different stage
of the operation.

22:37.870 --> 22:41.260
I understand mission codes.

22:42.440 --> 22:44.226
Oh, yes.

22:44.270 --> 22:48.138
Um, they're famous
television detectives.

22:54.370 --> 22:56.588
Oh.

22:56.630 --> 22:58.188
Columbo!

22:58.240 --> 23:00.765
Columbo.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.162
You make a friend
back there?

23:10.210 --> 23:13.555
Turns out
we ran a few Shake 'n' Bakes

23:13.600 --> 23:16.125
with his unit in
Kabul in 2015,

23:16.170 --> 23:17.421
and we know
some of the same guys.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.959
Well, I'm glad you're
enjoying your reunion.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.434
Now, he's the one
watching Asadi, right?Yeah.

23:21.480 --> 23:23.300
Okay, well,
I want you watching him.

23:23.350 --> 23:24.487
Copy that.

23:24.530 --> 23:26.043
We have the wife.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.783
Okay, if you hear
anything funlq,

23:27.840 --> 23:30.479
anything at all,
you get on the wire.

23:30.530 --> 23:31.610
Check.
Okay, good.

23:31.670 --> 23:33.149
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

23:33.190 --> 23:37.843
Bravo 6 and our partner

23:37.890 --> 23:39.846
Stand by.

23:39.890 --> 23:41.755

24:05.920 --> 24:07.911

I'm in control. Stand by.

24:25.890 --> 24:27.539
Execute.

Go, Bravo 6.

24:51.010 --> 24:53.831
Entering men's quarters.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.716
Bravo 1, Bravo 4
entering servants' quarters.

25:17.900 --> 25:19.117
Permaz Hakan?

25:20.600 --> 25:22.909
Permaz Hakan?

25:22.950 --> 25:24.599
Permaz Hakan?
Permaz Hakan?

25:29.130 --> 25:30.688
Permaz Hakan?

25:39.790 --> 25:41.792
Permaz Hakan?

25:43.750 --> 25:45.706
I don't see her, Jace.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.797
11 women. 12 beds. Okay.

25:48.850 --> 25:51.626
You stay with them.
Rest of us, let's go.

25:51.680 --> 25:52.806
JASON:
This is Bravo 1.

25:59.030 --> 26:00.543
Bravo 6, this is Bravo 1.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.591
What's your status?

26:02.640 --> 26:05.768
Still clearing.
Men's quarters unsecured.

26:13.180 --> 26:16.172
JASON: This is Bravo 1.
Entering prisoners' barracks.

26:24.620 --> 26:26.349
Permaz Hakan?

26:27.360 --> 26:28.349
Permaz Hakan?

26:35.550 --> 26:36.847
Clear.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.596
Son of a bitch.

26:49.650 --> 26:51.686
JASON: TOC, we got a bunch
of women and children.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.776
They're in pretty bad shape.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.959
Vanessa.

26:56.000 --> 26:57.513
Gonna need you in here.

26:57.570 --> 26:59.435

Yeah, this is Bravo 6.

26:59.480 --> 27:02.483
We've secured the first_ room.
No Sign of Mazari.

28:01.150 --> 28:02.845
It's Mazari.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.377

28:07.420 --> 28:09.115
Passing Hutch.

28:09.160 --> 28:10.639
We got him.

28:10.680 --> 28:12.284
We got our human trafficker.

28:18.260 --> 28:20.478
Congratulations.

28:21.610 --> 28:24.249
Congratulations to you,
Commander Rasul.

28:24.310 --> 28:26.471
Thank you.It was an honor
working with you.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.043
Likewise.

28:34.840 --> 28:36.444
The commander
wants to know

28:36.490 --> 28:38.219
why you have not
checked off Rockford.

28:45.070 --> 28:47.800
Bravo 1, this is TOC.
How are you with Rockford?

28:47.850 --> 28:49.545
Negative. Still looking.

28:49.590 --> 28:51.979
Is there a problem?

28:52.030 --> 28:54.464
No, sir.

29:13.570 --> 29:15.959
Where's that replacement
solider, Asadi?

29:16.010 --> 29:18.524
He stayed behind to
secure the men we shot.

29:18.580 --> 29:19.706
It's all right.

29:19.750 --> 29:21.399
My lieutenant, Bahari,
is with him.

29:26.980 --> 29:29.494
I left them here.

29:29.550 --> 29:32.496
Bravo 1, this is Bravo 6.
We got a problem.

29:32.550 --> 29:34.984
Asadi, the new guy--
he's unaccounted for.

29:35.030 --> 29:37.498
Copy that.

29:37.550 --> 29:40.110
We're still looking for Permaz
in barracks one.

29:40.160 --> 29:42.162
Yeah, we're headed to you.

30:02.530 --> 30:05.579
Damn it.

30:06.930 --> 30:08.704
Bravo 1, it's Bravo 6.

30:08.760 --> 30:10.580
Asadi's dead.
His throat was slit.

30:12.630 --> 30:14.279
Copy that, Bravo 6.

30:14.330 --> 30:16.321
No sign of Permaz
in barracks one.

30:16.370 --> 30:18.634
Meet us in barracks two.

30:21.210 --> 30:23.895
JASON:

30:40.700 --> 30:43.442

Bahari speaking Pashto]

30:49.970 --> 30:50.834
Bahaﬁ!

30:56.370 --> 30:58.804
[women continue
screaming, crying]

30:58.850 --> 30:59.976
Permaz Hakan?

31:02.460 --> 31:05.076
Permaz Hakan.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.417
Positive I.D.

31:06.470 --> 31:07.243
Yeah.

31:07.300 --> 31:08.289
Yeah.

31:08.340 --> 31:10.240
TOC, this is Bravo 1.

31:10.300 --> 31:12.029
We have a James Garner.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.253
Let's go home.

31:19.130 --> 31:21.132
That's Rockford.

31:27.660 --> 31:30.663
NABI:
I knew this man.

31:30.710 --> 31:32.666
I trusted him.
He betrayed me.

31:32.710 --> 31:34.018
Well, you live
and learn.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.756
He murdered
that poor boy, Asadi,

31:36.800 --> 31:37.971
the one
that we suspected.

31:38.020 --> 31:39.362
Yeah, well,
he would've killed us, too,

31:39.410 --> 31:40.752
if he had the chance, 50...

31:40.810 --> 31:43.586
What do you want to do
about the report?

31:43.640 --> 31:45.289
Mazari's thugs killed him.

31:45.330 --> 31:47.639
They killed Asadi, too.

31:47.680 --> 31:49.944
Both died heroes.

31:49.990 --> 31:52.948
[spits, speaks angrily
in Pashto]

31:52.990 --> 31:55.595
Sounds about right.
You good with that?

31:55.650 --> 31:57.254
Oh, yeah.Okay.

31:57.300 --> 31:58.642
Sounds good.Let's go.

32:07.830 --> 32:10.173
MANDY: I understand
you speak English?

32:12.710 --> 32:15.099
Well, let's just assume you do.

32:17.540 --> 32:21.886
This is a map of properties
belonging to KSR Holdings.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.977
The ones_in red
were purchased in your name,

32:25.030 --> 32:27.066
when you lived
with Salim Hakan.

32:27.110 --> 32:29.761
The ones in blue,
after you left him.

32:31.900 --> 32:34.243
You're a wealthy woman.

32:34.300 --> 32:37.940
Or you would be, if you actually
owned any of that land.

32:40.780 --> 32:42.736
Tell me about
your husband.

32:45.350 --> 32:48.786
You need a doctor? _
I can have one brought in.

32:53.400 --> 32:56.699
When I left my husband,

32:56.750 --> 32:58.536
I prayed to God
that the veins would open

32:58.580 --> 33:02.050
and I would bleed to death if
I ever came back to this city.

33:02.110 --> 33:04.840
That my wrists would sob blood.

33:04.890 --> 33:08.064
You don't have to die
to be safe from Salim.

33:08.110 --> 33:09.543
We can protect you.

33:09.590 --> 33:11.319
When I saw the soldiers,

33:11.380 --> 33:13.507
I thought they were coming
to bring me back to him.

33:13.550 --> 33:15.598
No, we want
information on him.

33:15.640 --> 33:16.891
Everything you know,

33:16.950 --> 33:19.373
so that we can put him in jail
for a long time.

33:19.430 --> 33:22.422
He will never
go to jail.

33:22.470 --> 33:25.257
He knows the people
who run the jails.

33:25.300 --> 33:27.473
He will just walk out,
through the bars,

33:27.520 --> 33:29.044
like he is air.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.739
American jail.

33:35.400 --> 33:39.871
Permaz, God didn't open
your veins.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.273
He's not gonna release you
through death.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.276
You ran and
you couldn't escape.

33:44.320 --> 33:47.187
You have to fight.
It's the only way.

33:56.640 --> 33:59.108
Okay.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.034
I spoke to your father.

34:07.080 --> 34:09.219
It's how we found you.

34:09.260 --> 34:10.477
He's alive?

34:10.520 --> 34:11.566
Yes.

34:11.610 --> 34:13.737
And he would like to see you.

34:20.920 --> 34:23.662
Trust me.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.848
Hi.

34:29.890 --> 34:31.846
How you doing?
Thanks for the invite.

34:31.890 --> 34:33.676
Can't tell you how
long I've been trying

34:33.720 --> 34:35.676
to get a look at this
place from the inside.

34:35.720 --> 34:38.109
Oh, welcome.
Happy I could oblige.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.582
Have a seat.

34:39.640 --> 34:41.369
Not so sure
I believe that,

34:41.420 --> 34:44.685
but, uh, to tell you the truth,
I was starting to worry

34:44.730 --> 34:47.813
this sit-down was
never gonna happen.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.203
Mandy gave you
her word, right?

34:50.260 --> 34:51.648
She did.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.032
Good.

34:53.090 --> 34:55.126
That's the least I could do.
She always has our back.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.307
And I'm-I'm always
gonna have her back.

34:57.350 --> 35:00.911
So what's on the agenda?

35:00.960 --> 35:04.578
Well, uh, hoping we could start
off talking maybe a little bit

35:04.620 --> 35:06.747
about what you think
it is we're doing here.

35:06.800 --> 35:09.314
I really don't think
about stuff like that.

35:09.360 --> 35:11.624
I'm just here
to do my job.

35:11.670 --> 35:13.535
So it never bothers you,

35:13.580 --> 35:15.662
how you guys get used
to enforce the will

35:15.720 --> 35:17.676
of politicians
and corporations?

35:17.720 --> 35:19.847
You know, if you'd done your
job, you'd know we don't care

35:19.900 --> 35:21.936
about politicians
or corporations.

35:21.980 --> 35:24.198
_ _All _I care about
is Winning the war here

35:24.250 --> 35:25.501
and taking out terrorists.

35:25.550 --> 35:28.678
That's what I care about.
That's doing my job.

35:28.730 --> 35:30.948
How about...

35:30.990 --> 35:33.254
when you're used to
burn poppy fields?

35:33.300 --> 35:37.259
Not a mission
we would do.

35:37.300 --> 35:39.689
Although it is a mission
that Echo Team ran

35:39.740 --> 35:43.562
that led to them being
targeted in retaliation.

35:43.610 --> 35:45.566
I don't know
anything about that.

35:45.620 --> 35:48.180
You telling me
I've got that wrong?

35:48.230 --> 35:50.528
Telling you I'm not
discussing it, truth be told.

35:50.580 --> 35:53.185
Fair enough.
Mm-hmm.

35:53.230 --> 35:55.186
Hope you don't
blame me for asking.

35:55.240 --> 35:57.754
Opioid crisis back home
being what it is,

35:57.800 --> 35:59.495
poppies are the only
piece of Afghanistan

35:59.540 --> 36:01.269
anybody really wants
to read about.

36:01.330 --> 36:02.752
Doing your job.

36:02.810 --> 36:05.540
Funny thing.

36:05.590 --> 36:09.287
The real story here
is underground.

36:09.340 --> 36:10.546
Underground?

36:10.600 --> 36:12.329
Mining.

36:12.380 --> 36:14.553
What I've been told,
that's the future here.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.682
Coal mining?

36:16.730 --> 36:19.733
Mostly, it'll be
rare Earth metals.

36:19.780 --> 36:22.385
Stuff's in cell
phones, laptops,

36:22.440 --> 36:24.783
and apparently this
country is sitting on

36:24.830 --> 36:27.788
about a trillion dollars' worth
just underneath the dirt.

36:27.830 --> 36:29.616
Just waiting for
somebody to drill.

36:29.660 --> 36:31.742
Trillions with a "T."At least.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.350
Won't be able to
estimate the full extent

36:34.400 --> 36:36.004
until they can start
dropping shafts.

36:36.060 --> 36:39.143
Won't be able to do that
until this place is stable,

36:39.190 --> 36:42.921
which is where, I suppose,
you all come in.

36:42.980 --> 36:45.016
Right.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.753
"T" for team.

36:46.810 --> 36:48.937
Right?
"T" for team.
Yeah.

36:56.820 --> 36:59.903
Hey. How you doing?Hi. I missed you.

36:59.950 --> 37:03.124
You did?I don't think I'm supposed
to say that like that.

37:03.170 --> 37:05.126
I missed you, too.

37:05.170 --> 37:07.047
Come in.
Come in.

37:07.090 --> 37:08.398
Baby. No.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.089
I got to go.
I got to go check

37:10.140 --> 37:12.483
on-on this detainee
I rolled up last night.

37:12.530 --> 37:14.873
Oh. Okay. Oh, what? You
just wanted to make sure

37:14.920 --> 37:16.785
I'm up to date
on your whereabouts?

37:16.840 --> 37:19.092
Hmm? Well, thanks.Yeah. Mm-hmm.

37:19.140 --> 37:21.279
Actually, um, you know
Steve Porter's drill?

37:21.320 --> 37:22.662
Yeah.

37:22.710 --> 37:24.666
And I know you said you
didn't know what you wanted

37:24.720 --> 37:27.621
to do with it, and I was just
thinking maybe I could have it.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.456
Yeah. Actually, I think
that's a good idea.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.898
I got to get
the drill now.
All right.

37:33.940 --> 37:36.898
You stay here.I'm gonna stay right here.

37:38.990 --> 37:41.857
Hmm. Okay.

37:41.910 --> 37:43.252
Thanks.

37:43.300 --> 37:45.518
Yeah.

37:45.560 --> 37:46.731
I'll see you soon.

37:46.780 --> 37:48.088
Rain check.

37:48.130 --> 37:49.995
Yeah, definitely.

37:55.920 --> 37:57.046
Hi.

37:57.100 --> 37:58.522
Hi.

37:58.580 --> 38:01.617
So I had a sit-down
with your reporter friend.

38:01.670 --> 38:03.319
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.179
What'd you two talk about?

38:04.230 --> 38:05.538
Oh, you know,
this and that.

38:05.580 --> 38:09.277
Doesn't matter. Bottom line
is you kept your word.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.413
So how did it go
in there with the wife?

38:12.460 --> 38:15.839
Well, it's been years
since she's seen Salim,

38:15.900 --> 38:17.800
so she doesn't know
anything about him targeting

38:17.860 --> 38:20.328
Echo Team in particular,
but she does claim to know

38:20.380 --> 38:22.428
that he's targeted
Americans in the past.

38:22.470 --> 38:24.779
Wasn't surprised to
hear he's still at it.

38:24.820 --> 38:27.163
I bet.Also gave us

38:27.210 --> 38:28.905
a dozen _names_
she says Will confirm

38:28.950 --> 38:30.861
Salim wants to be
the Afghan El Chapo.

38:30.910 --> 38:32.081
Enough to give us a green light?

38:32.130 --> 38:34.382
Honestly?

38:34.440 --> 38:36.396
Yeah, I figured
you were gonna say that.

38:36.440 --> 38:38.522
Gonna be a lot of
red faces on our Side

38:38.570 --> 38:40.526
when Salim turns out to be bad.

38:40.570 --> 38:43.357
Means most people won't be
inclined to believe it.

38:43.400 --> 38:46.312
We'll have to give them
something undeniable.

38:46.360 --> 38:48.828
Because she can't.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.756
But he can.

39:03.950 --> 39:05.599
Chai.

39:10.690 --> 39:12.555
Miss Ellis.

39:12.610 --> 39:14.908
General Hakan.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.121
How kind of you
to invite me here.

39:18.700 --> 39:22.079
Commander Rasul tells me
congratulations are in order.

39:22.140 --> 39:24.779
You've added a human trafficker
to your list of successes.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.354
That was nothing.
The real prize was Permaz.

39:31.060 --> 39:33.494
My wife.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.588
You will find her
a difficult woman.

39:35.630 --> 39:38.497
She has many, uh...
problems, you know.

39:38.550 --> 39:41.496
Not compared to yours.

39:41.550 --> 39:43.370
I thought you were
just another dirty cop

39:43.420 --> 39:44.853
I had to do business with,

39:44.900 --> 39:46.413
but it turns out,

39:46.470 --> 39:49.200
you've been building yourself
quite the empire here,

39:49.250 --> 39:52.037
playing both sides.

39:52.080 --> 39:54.469
Your wife has
lots of stories to tell.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.556
Drug lords, terrorists...

39:56.610 --> 39:58.601
And what alarm
those stories would raise

39:58.650 --> 40:01.380
among my friends
in the US. government.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.568
A prized American partner,

40:04.610 --> 40:07.738
a leader of
an allied nation,

40:07.790 --> 40:11.829
accused of consorting
with terrorists?

40:11.880 --> 40:13.836
No.

40:13.880 --> 40:16.314
If what my wife told you
was sufficient for you

40:16.370 --> 40:17.792
to disappoint
all of those people,

40:17.850 --> 40:19.454
you wouldn't have asked me here.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.458
You want me to know
that you know,

40:22.500 --> 40:25.458
so you can observe
my next move.

40:25.510 --> 40:27.762
Perhaps you should
be considering

40:27.810 --> 40:30.278
your moves more carefully.

40:30.340 --> 40:33.377
Nobody would be surprised
if a pretty American girl

40:33.430 --> 40:35.853
was found dead
in this part of town.

40:37.520 --> 40:39.476
You're right.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.420
Nobody would be surprised.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.995
My clear, your pride
has made you careless.

40:46.610 --> 40:48.612
Not necessarily.

41:03.670 --> 41:06.195
See you soon, General.
