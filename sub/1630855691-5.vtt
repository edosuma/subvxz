00:10.343 --> 00:14.097
The notorious serial killer, Mask Girl,
has finally made an appearance.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.433
Rumor has it she's addicted
to plastic surgery

00:16.516 --> 00:18.643
and right now is being escorted
into the police station.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.311
Kim, also known as Mask Girl,

00:20.395 --> 00:23.565
was taken in by the prosecution
as a suspect this morning.

00:23.648 --> 00:25.650
According to an insider,
Ms. Kim has admitted

00:25.734 --> 00:28.361
to every single one of the charges,
including murder.

00:28.445 --> 00:29.362
C'mon!

00:29.446 --> 00:30.864
Excuse me, sir!

00:33.199 --> 00:36.119
-Look over here!
-Over here!

00:36.202 --> 00:38.163
-What's on the menu?
-What did she order?

00:38.246 --> 00:39.164
It's beef bone soup.

00:39.247 --> 00:41.082
What kind of beef bone soup?

00:41.166 --> 00:45.378
MASK GIRL ORDERS BEEF BONE SOUP…

00:45.462 --> 00:49.424
Looks like she did her eyes,
nose, cheekbones, chin…

00:50.091 --> 00:51.342
everything, really.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.472
She got herself
a whole remodeled face, basically.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.057
The clothes worn by Mask Girl,

00:57.140 --> 00:59.100
who's been in the spotlight
these past few days,

00:59.184 --> 01:01.227
are the hottest-selling items right now.

01:01.311 --> 01:04.481
Um, it's pretty, you know?
And it's popular too.

01:04.564 --> 01:08.193
This crowd has gathered today
to protest against Mask Girl,

01:08.276 --> 01:11.654
as the big trial against her
finally begins this morning.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.824
The accused has been attacked
and persecuted since her childhood

01:14.908 --> 01:16.201
because of her appearance.

01:16.284 --> 01:19.162
The victim, Mr. Jun-mo Lee,
has attacked my client,

01:19.245 --> 01:22.499
Ms. Mo-mi Kim, verbally,
by repeatedly insulting her looks,

01:22.582 --> 01:24.918
and physically, by attempting to rape her.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.339
Through what he wrote
on social media,

01:29.422 --> 01:31.633
we can clearly see
the victim's exact motives

01:31.716 --> 01:33.343
when he chose to meet with the defendant.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.637
The victim's social media account,

01:35.720 --> 01:39.265
is evidence that he was only interested
in meeting with Mask Girl

01:39.349 --> 01:40.683
out of sexual curiosity.

01:40.767 --> 01:41.935
Shut up!

01:43.728 --> 01:46.773
Your client… Your client killed my son!

01:47.273 --> 01:48.608
Get off of me!

01:49.109 --> 01:51.820
If being called ugly
is enough to make you kill someone,

01:51.903 --> 01:53.738
then no one would be alive
in this country!

01:53.822 --> 01:55.990
Please be quiet
or you will be asked to leave.

01:56.074 --> 01:57.033
Let go of me!

01:57.700 --> 01:59.202
-You dirty slut.
-Remove her.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.663
-You motherfucker!
-Mom! Please, c'mon.

02:03.081 --> 02:07.293
The crime in this case will be
constituted as a most serious crime.

02:07.377 --> 02:09.921
The defendant's
heinous crimes against humanity

02:10.004 --> 02:11.798
caused great shock to society.

02:13.383 --> 02:15.635
From the standpoint
of fair punishment

02:15.718 --> 02:17.303
or general crime prevention,

02:17.387 --> 02:21.891
a sentence that forever isolates
the defendant from society is inevitable.

02:22.392 --> 02:24.394
Thus, the defendant is sentenced

02:24.477 --> 02:25.687
to life in prison.

04:13.336 --> 04:18.800
MASK GIRL

04:19.926 --> 04:24.097
MI-MO KIM

04:32.355 --> 04:34.190
My name is Mi-mo Kim.

04:34.732 --> 04:36.067
That name was given by my mom.

04:36.150 --> 04:37.026
Please!

04:37.819 --> 04:39.237
I'll come back for her soon!

04:40.655 --> 04:41.489
I can't.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.617
I won't raise your baby for you, Mo-mi.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.577
I'm not asking you to raise her.

04:46.661 --> 04:49.414
I'm just asking you
to look after her for a bit, that's all.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.581
No. I can't.

04:51.249 --> 04:52.166
Wait!

04:53.167 --> 04:54.585
I'm going overseas.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.880
I need to get a lot of stuff ready,
including a fake passport.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.633
I can't do all of that
while carrying the baby around.

05:01.259 --> 05:04.637
I'll come back for her as soon as I'm done
with everything. Please!

05:05.346 --> 05:06.681
I'm begging you!

05:09.183 --> 05:10.685
But the years went by,

05:11.394 --> 05:12.770
and my mom never came back.

05:18.443 --> 05:19.277
Soon enough,

05:19.986 --> 05:21.571
I forgot about her existence.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.371
When I was young,
I liked to doll myself up.

05:33.041 --> 05:35.626
What are you doing? Oh jeez!

05:36.961 --> 05:39.380
You like dressing up, like your mother.

05:39.464 --> 05:40.715
Oh dear!

05:44.344 --> 05:46.596
My grandma would always say
I was like my mom,

05:47.096 --> 05:49.640
but she never actually
told me anything about her.

05:53.644 --> 05:55.271
Put your elbows down.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.154
And don't be so loud.

06:04.405 --> 06:06.699
I didn't really like
the food my grandma made.

06:08.743 --> 06:10.119
My favorite food

06:11.704 --> 06:14.123
was the cup of tteokbokki
sold in front of my school.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.917
Wow, this is incredible.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.295
Then, one day, something happened,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.422
and I finally learned
something about my mother.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.674
-…it's really good!
-Yeah, sure!

06:23.758 --> 06:24.842
-Mom!
-Let's go.

06:24.926 --> 06:27.637
-But I'm eating with Mi-mo!
-Don't play with her anymore.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.515
-Why not? I want to!
-Her mom's Mask Girl.

06:30.598 --> 06:33.434
-What's "Mask Girl"?
-You don't need to know.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.313
MASK GIRL

06:40.441 --> 06:41.984
MASK GIRL TURNS HERSELF IN

06:42.068 --> 06:43.111
WHO IS MASK GIRL?

06:43.194 --> 06:44.445
WHY SHE BECAME A KILLER

06:47.407 --> 06:50.243
MASK GIRL SURRENDERS HERSELF
PERFECT BODY

07:40.376 --> 07:41.335
Murderer!

07:44.005 --> 07:45.256
Murderer's daughter!

07:46.299 --> 07:49.886
Die! Die, Mask Girl, die!

07:56.809 --> 08:00.188
Good afternoon. I'm reporter Mi-mo Kim.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.649
Mask Girl, why did you commit murder?

08:06.819 --> 08:10.323
Welcome, everyone!
There are so many of you here.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.077
You can take pictures now!

08:15.161 --> 08:17.955
Everyone, I am Mask Girl!

08:20.791 --> 08:23.127
What's the… matter with you?

08:25.546 --> 08:27.423
-I'm sorry, Grandma.
-Get out, now!

08:27.507 --> 08:29.133
-Grandma! Grandma!
-Get out, now!

08:29.675 --> 08:31.010
-Grandma!
-I can't do this.

08:31.093 --> 08:34.055
-I'm sorry, Grandma.
-I don't think I can raise you anymore!

08:34.138 --> 08:36.224
-Get out of here!
-Grandma, please!

08:36.724 --> 08:39.268
I'm really sorry, Grandma.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.228
Grandma!

09:18.099 --> 09:18.933
Grandma…

09:22.186 --> 09:23.437
what kind of person

09:24.897 --> 09:25.982
was my mother?

09:27.191 --> 09:28.276
Why do you ask?

09:30.027 --> 09:32.029
I guess I'm a bit curious.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.156
She was

09:35.324 --> 09:37.410
a lost cause from the very start.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.709
The rumors about my mom spread quickly.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.836
-Monster's daughter!
-Monster's daughter!

09:51.173 --> 09:52.883
And the source of the rumors

09:53.426 --> 09:54.885
was my best friend.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.939
-You spread the rumors.
-Hm?

10:18.034 --> 10:22.538
There have been a lot of complaints
from other parents, you know?

10:26.292 --> 10:28.127
Doesn't matter.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.254
We wanted to move anyway.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.554
Tteokbokki Grandma,
I'm moving away.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.973
I can't come here anymore.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.725
But wherever I went,

10:43.392 --> 10:44.852
the rumors followed.

10:45.394 --> 10:46.312
WHAT'S THIS?

10:46.395 --> 10:47.563
MI-MO KIM IN SECOND GRADE

10:47.647 --> 10:48.481
IS SHE CRAZY?

10:48.564 --> 10:50.149
KIDS CALLED HER MASK GIRL'S KID
SO SHE'S HITTING THEM?

10:50.232 --> 10:52.193
GUYS, SAW THIS?
SHE IS HELLA SCARY

10:52.276 --> 10:53.944
SHE'S CRAZY
TRULY A MURDERER'S DAUGHTER

10:54.028 --> 10:55.571
LIKE MOTHER, LIKE DAUGHTER

10:55.655 --> 10:57.073
JIYA INVITED MI-MO KIM TO A CHAT

10:57.156 --> 10:58.574
HEY, YOUR MOM REALLY MASK GIRL?

10:58.658 --> 11:00.159
TRANSFERRED CUZ YOU BEAT A KID?

11:00.242 --> 11:01.410
A REAL THUG AT SCHOOL

11:01.494 --> 11:03.287
EVIL BITCH'S GONNA BEAT US UP TOO?

11:03.371 --> 11:04.914
GET THE HELL OUT OF OUR SCHOOL

11:14.090 --> 11:17.927
I won't be able to help you
if you cause trouble again, understood?

11:18.803 --> 11:22.181
I was barely able to keep you
from being sent to juvenile detention.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.191
You don't wanna become
like your mother, do you, Mi-mo?

11:38.948 --> 11:41.659
Don't refer to that bitch
as my mom from now on.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.495
It makes me sick.

11:52.294 --> 11:53.629
Introduce yourself.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.840
I'm Mi-mo Kim.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.509
-Did she say "me-miaow"?
-What kinda name is that?

11:58.592 --> 11:59.510
Quiet now!

12:00.678 --> 12:01.846
Sit, uh?

12:02.346 --> 12:03.889
There. Next to Jin-hong, okay?

12:05.558 --> 12:06.976
He's a boy. I don't wanna sit there.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.228
I'd like to sit with a girl.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.564
-Come on, is this for real?
-Oh gosh.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.899
What the heck?
That's fricking weird.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.444
So, um, uh, there.
You can sit next to Ye-chun.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.238
Ma'am.

12:19.905 --> 12:22.908
I don't wanna sit with her.
I'd like to sit alone.

12:22.992 --> 12:24.910
Pranking me, huh? Are you?

12:24.994 --> 12:26.537
Sit. Go on. Have a seat.

12:27.788 --> 12:30.583
You all know that finals
are right around the corner,

12:31.250 --> 12:33.878
pay attention during class, okay?

12:33.961 --> 12:35.713
-Okay!
-Good.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.343
They're so cute, huh?

12:41.927 --> 12:45.639
-Hey! I wanted to sit with a boy.
-I know, right?

12:45.723 --> 12:48.100
Are they
the first couple in our class?

13:01.530 --> 13:05.785
Lunch today, huh? Just three meatballs?

13:06.494 --> 13:07.912
Did you see M Countdown?

13:07.995 --> 13:11.165
Oh! My heart burst
because of the NCT guys.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.458
They're handsome, right?

13:12.958 --> 13:14.001
Hey.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.795
That's someone else's seat, so…

13:17.838 --> 13:20.424
We don't have
assigned seats in the lunchroom.

13:21.175 --> 13:23.219
Hey. Get lost.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.931
You're in my seat.

13:33.145 --> 13:34.146
Ridiculous.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.279
Are you eating alone?
I'll eat with you, okay?

13:48.786 --> 13:49.620
Hey.

13:50.371 --> 13:51.205
Hey, you.

13:53.457 --> 13:54.625
Here, come closer.

13:55.876 --> 13:56.836
I said come closer.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.382
You are an outcast, did you know that?

14:02.591 --> 14:03.425
What?

14:04.218 --> 14:05.344
I'll be your friend.

14:06.595 --> 14:08.389
-No, thanks.
-What?

14:09.181 --> 14:10.808
I don't need a friend. I'm good.

14:14.770 --> 14:15.604
Hey!

14:17.231 --> 14:18.065
Hey!

14:19.817 --> 14:20.651
Hey!

14:21.402 --> 14:22.528
Wait, wait a minute.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.282

14:27.533 --> 14:28.909
idol group do you like?

14:30.411 --> 14:31.579
Do you wanna buy these?

14:32.288 --> 14:34.540
I waited for hours to get these signed.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.958
-This is pretty--
-Hey, listen.

14:37.376 --> 14:38.377
Get lost, will ya?

14:44.592 --> 14:46.260
She's so rude. Oh my God.

14:49.179 --> 14:51.891
GIRL GROUP LOVEME'S SUA

MI-MO, YE-CHUN

15:49.406 --> 15:51.325
Hey! Where are you going?

15:54.495 --> 15:55.496
That freaking…

16:11.095 --> 16:12.429
Oh, you're here.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.765
So which one do you wanna buy?

16:14.848 --> 16:16.976
I've got lots of them. Wanna take a look?

16:19.103 --> 16:21.939
Hey, can we see it too?

16:22.022 --> 16:23.649
Wow. I'm so curious.

16:23.732 --> 16:24.817
Look at her!

16:24.900 --> 16:27.194
Hey, that's mine! Give it back!

16:28.779 --> 16:29.989
Give it back!

16:31.365 --> 16:34.118
Give it back! I said it's mine!

16:34.201 --> 16:35.703
-It's mine!
-Let go!

16:39.915 --> 16:40.916
What?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.011
It's all fake. She autographed it herself.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.431
No! I… I got them autographed in person.

16:55.514 --> 16:58.017
Bullshit, you lying slut.

16:58.809 --> 17:01.562
She lies every time she speaks.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.817
Hey.

17:07.401 --> 17:08.235
Hey!

17:09.445 --> 17:10.612
C'mon, get lost.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.245
Didn't you hear me?

17:28.255 --> 17:29.423
You're idiots.

17:29.506 --> 17:30.591
-What?
-Ah!

17:31.133 --> 17:32.509
What did you just say?

17:33.010 --> 17:34.219
Stupid idiots.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.638
-That bitch.
-What the hell? What a psycho.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.348
You fucking bitch. You're dead…

17:43.312 --> 17:44.229
Wanna get stabbed?

17:51.153 --> 17:53.489
Hey. Hey, l-- let's go.

17:53.572 --> 17:57.367
-That bitch is a fuckin' psycho.
-She's fucking nuts.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.036
Hey, are you okay?

18:00.662 --> 18:02.539
Why did you grab a piece of glass?

18:04.374 --> 18:05.375
Give me your hand.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.598
You did this to yourself?

18:22.851 --> 18:25.562
I tidied everything up,
so you finish cleaning.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.356
Okay, sure!

18:55.134 --> 18:55.968
I can't do it.

19:16.905 --> 19:17.739
Hey.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.918
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Wake up.

19:34.464 --> 19:35.591
What is that?

19:37.509 --> 19:38.635
I guess we're more alike now.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.345
What the--

19:43.307 --> 19:44.349
Where are you going?

19:44.433 --> 19:45.684
To the bathroom.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.936
Wait for me.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.771
Hey! Wait for me!

19:57.279 --> 19:58.947
Why are you coming in here?

20:02.201 --> 20:05.204
-We're friends. It's fine.
-We're not kids.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.418
Oh boy. You're a pervert.

20:12.002 --> 20:15.339
That's right, I'm a pervert.
Hm-hm-hm!

20:18.634 --> 20:20.260
-Here you go.
-Thank you. Have a good one.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.178
Bye!

20:23.263 --> 20:26.141
-What do you think? Pretty good, right?
-It's okay.

20:26.642 --> 20:29.228
The tteokbokki where I used to live
was really good.

20:38.153 --> 20:39.279
You know, I…

20:40.239 --> 20:41.698
Hey, I have a secret, Mi-mo.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.617
-Can I tell you?
-What is it?

20:45.827 --> 20:47.746
I wanna murder my mother sometimes.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.040
What? Why?

20:51.667 --> 20:54.628
A couple of weeks ago,
I rescued a small kitten I found.

20:55.379 --> 20:56.922
It was in really bad shape.

20:57.506 --> 21:00.425
But Mom didn't want it!
I had to take it back, you know?

21:02.844 --> 21:04.179
It's probably dead.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.765
And well, I thought…

21:06.848 --> 21:09.017
It's like my mom
killed the cat, basically.

21:10.185 --> 21:11.186
That's your problem?

21:13.647 --> 21:15.440
Yeah, that's it. What do you mean?

21:17.651 --> 21:19.236
Know what? Forget it.

21:19.861 --> 21:21.571
Hey. Hey!

21:22.656 --> 21:24.366
What's wrong? Where are you going?

21:24.449 --> 21:26.410
Uh-- Hey, wait. Hey!

21:30.706 --> 21:35.002
What's wrong? We're friends.
We can talk about stuff like that, right?

21:35.085 --> 21:38.797
I don't need friends, remember?
I'm just gonna lay low until I graduate.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.382
Why are you suddenly so angry?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.592
You don't tell me anything about yourself.

21:47.472 --> 21:48.682
You wanna know about me?

21:52.144 --> 21:52.978
Mm-hmm.

21:56.940 --> 21:57.774
Well, don't.

21:58.608 --> 21:59.985
You wouldn't understand.

22:01.862 --> 22:03.572
Hey. Hey!

22:05.699 --> 22:06.825
I wouldn't understand?

22:07.951 --> 22:09.911
You know what I hate dealing with, huh?

22:10.537 --> 22:13.165
My dad coming home drunk
and beating my mom, okay?

22:13.790 --> 22:16.460
I took a knife and almost stabbed my dad.
Did you know that?

22:17.878 --> 22:19.963
You think you're
the only one with problems?

22:20.047 --> 22:23.467
You think you're the only sad one
just because you hurt yourself!

22:28.597 --> 22:30.682
Huh? It's raining.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.101
Hey, run! Come on, run!

22:36.521 --> 22:38.857
Argh!

22:55.499 --> 22:57.918
Does your dad get drunk often?

22:59.086 --> 22:59.920
Mm-hmm.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.715
I wish my dad would just die, you know?

23:05.217 --> 23:06.676
And my mom too.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.597
She's not my real mom, actually. She's my

23:11.932 --> 23:13.016
stepmom.

23:18.855 --> 23:20.107
Well, you're better off.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.234
What?

23:28.073 --> 23:28.907
You…

23:29.866 --> 23:31.701
won't tell anyone about this, right?

23:32.452 --> 23:34.246
-Uh, no.
-Hmm.

23:44.381 --> 23:45.465
I don't know…

23:46.758 --> 23:48.135
I don't know who my dad is.

23:49.719 --> 23:50.887
And my mom's in prison.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.223
She's in prison?

23:54.850 --> 23:56.726
My mom never called me. Not once.

23:59.020 --> 24:01.273
She's never even wondered
about how I'm doing.

24:03.567 --> 24:04.985
Then, who do you live with?

24:06.319 --> 24:07.154
My grandma.

24:08.905 --> 24:11.783
Your grandma never told you
anything about your mom?

24:12.868 --> 24:13.869
She says she

24:14.995 --> 24:16.830
hates talking about my mom.

24:17.873 --> 24:19.124
It's probably my fault.

24:32.053 --> 24:34.806
Well-- Well-- I think
you're really special, all right?

24:39.478 --> 24:42.230
Could you be more cheesy?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.409
Say, uh, "ah." Here.

24:58.830 --> 25:00.540
You're home.

25:00.624 --> 25:03.001
Why so late?
We're doing barbecue, remember?

25:03.084 --> 25:04.127
Wash your hands.

25:04.711 --> 25:05.754
I'm not hungry.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.965
Hey, you asked for this, right?

25:09.049 --> 25:10.926
I'm not hungry!

25:11.009 --> 25:13.011
What? We bought a lot of meat.

25:13.094 --> 25:15.430
Hey! Is something wrong?

25:15.514 --> 25:16.890
No!

25:18.433 --> 25:20.018
Dear God.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.895
Don't know what's come over her.

25:23.230 --> 25:24.606
MI-MO♥

25:24.689 --> 25:28.235
She's going through puberty,
let her be. There, there, there.

25:28.318 --> 25:30.403
I FREAKING HATE BEING HOME

25:30.487 --> 25:31.571
MY DAD'S DRUNK AND VIOLENT AGAIN

25:31.655 --> 25:33.406
REALLY? OH NO!

25:33.490 --> 25:34.449
WHATEVER…

25:34.533 --> 25:37.035
I'M JUST HIDING IN MY ROOM RIGHT NOW

25:37.118 --> 25:38.828
Here, I'll make a wrap for you.

25:40.580 --> 25:41.915
BUT I'M GLAD I HAVE YOU

25:41.998 --> 25:43.917
Be careful, it's hot! It's hot.

25:44.459 --> 25:48.713
AND I'M GLAD I CAN TALK
ABOUT STUFF LIKE THIS WITH YOU

25:48.797 --> 25:50.423
HAHA
ME TOO

25:58.056 --> 26:00.141
Wow, the soulmates are here.

26:00.225 --> 26:01.518
You're a cute couple.

26:01.601 --> 26:03.353
Miss Bed-wetter, hello!

26:03.436 --> 26:04.271
What?

26:04.354 --> 26:06.356
-Let's go.
-That bitch.

26:07.732 --> 26:11.820
She used to be an outcast. She peed
herself in class in elementary school.

26:11.903 --> 26:14.614
Everyone saw it,
so they called her "Bed-wetter."

26:14.698 --> 26:15.949
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.702
Then we got to middle school,
she shortened her skirt

26:18.785 --> 26:20.078
and started wearing makeup.

26:20.161 --> 26:21.830
And started following the bullies around.

26:22.664 --> 26:25.041
Now she's not an outcast anymore.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.168
She picks on you the most.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.212
-I know. Ridiculous, right?
-Mm-hmm.

26:29.963 --> 26:30.922
She's a hypocrite.

26:37.137 --> 26:40.599
During the Joseon Dynasty,
Seowon was a private institution…

26:42.309 --> 26:46.229
…and where ancestral rites
were held for virtuous Confucian scholars.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.571
You two in the back.
Go out to the hallway.

26:55.196 --> 26:56.281
Oh.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.415
-It was used to foster talent…
-I heard they're in love.

27:05.498 --> 27:08.001
-Someone saw them making out.
-Aren't they super annoying?

27:08.501 --> 27:10.086
-I heard about it.
-Really?

27:10.170 --> 27:11.087
Yeah.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.423
That's so crazy.

27:18.219 --> 27:20.305
You're… pretty damn ugly.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.434
That's nonsense.
I'd say you're pretty damn ugly.

27:24.517 --> 27:27.145
-I'm not. You're the pretty damn ugliest.
-Bullshit.

27:27.228 --> 27:30.857
If I'm that, then you're the pretty damn
ugliest in the whole wide world.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.175
By the way,

27:57.926 --> 28:00.428
why did your mom go to prison anyway?

28:01.846 --> 28:03.223
Why are you asking me that?

28:04.557 --> 28:05.809
I'm just curious.

28:12.107 --> 28:13.233
She killed someone.

28:13.983 --> 28:14.818
What?!

28:17.570 --> 28:18.405
What?

28:20.115 --> 28:21.783
You think I'm a monster too.

28:24.452 --> 28:25.286
No, I don't.

28:32.001 --> 28:34.254
My dad went crazy again yesterday.

28:35.046 --> 28:37.215
He broke everything, dishes and all.

28:37.298 --> 28:38.133
Really?

28:39.634 --> 28:42.178
My mom left the house crying.

28:43.054 --> 28:44.973
Honestly, it's a real mess.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.937
Should we… run away?

28:52.147 --> 28:53.898
-From home?
-Mm-hmm.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.068
I like that.

28:57.152 --> 29:00.905
We should, um, try to find a place
we could live together, right?

29:01.531 --> 29:03.783
Don't we need a lot of money for that?

29:04.367 --> 29:05.201
Do you have any?

29:06.828 --> 29:07.787
I don't have money.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.458
Well, so we can't afford
to run away.

29:12.667 --> 29:16.296
But still, I think
it would be fun if we lived together.

29:16.379 --> 29:17.338
Right?

29:32.771 --> 29:38.401
DAUGHTER OF KOREA'S FEMALE MURDERER
MI-MO KIM

29:45.450 --> 29:48.745
KOREA'S FEMALE MURDERER

29:55.084 --> 29:57.128
FEMALE MURDERER'S DAUGHTER

30:00.465 --> 30:03.009
CRIMINALS WHO PASS DOWN THE VIOLENT GENE

30:03.092 --> 30:04.010
IS VIOLENCE GENETIC?

30:06.054 --> 30:10.809
SERIAL KILLER MASK GIRL'S DAUGHTER
CAUGHT UP IN SCHOOL VIOLENCE SCANDAL

30:16.272 --> 30:18.858
CONTROVERSY OVER THE ALLEGED
SCHOOL VIOLENCE AGAINST MS. KIM,

30:18.942 --> 30:22.320
BELIEVED TO BE MASK GIRL'S DAUGHTER,
HAS ERUPTED.

30:22.403 --> 30:26.783
THE NAME OF MASK GIRL, FORGOTTEN
BY THE PUBLIC FOR A WHILE, IS RESURFACING

30:26.866 --> 30:30.203
THE PARENTS OF STUDENTS AT THE SCHOOL
ARE VERY CONCERNED

30:30.286 --> 30:32.247
NEARLY FORGOT, BUT MG IS BACK!

30:33.832 --> 30:36.376
SHE USED TO GO TO MY SCHOOL
BUT TRANSFERRED TO SEONGRIM

30:43.216 --> 30:45.093
Ye-chun! Ye-chun!

30:45.802 --> 30:46.636
What?!

30:46.719 --> 30:49.514
-I need you to feed the baby.
-Uh! Mom, I'm busy!

30:50.056 --> 30:52.016
You're not getting any allowance, then.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.270
Where's the baby food?

30:56.229 --> 30:57.146
Here.

31:00.525 --> 31:03.069
-Say "ah."
-All dressed!

31:03.152 --> 31:05.780
Honey, come over and eat
if you're done dressing him up.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.657
-Ah!
-We gotta be quick, okay?

31:07.740 --> 31:08.700
Yummy, huh?

31:09.450 --> 31:11.578
Okay, let's eat!

31:13.580 --> 31:14.455
Guess what?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.916
I'm friends with Mask Girl's daughter.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.418
Isn't that amazing?

31:19.043 --> 31:21.838
I feel bad for Mi-mo, you know?

31:21.921 --> 31:24.340
So I'm never going to leave
my friend's side ever.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.967
Yeah, I should help her.

31:28.344 --> 31:31.222
But I need money if I wanna help her, huh?

31:35.476 --> 31:37.061
-Sheep.
-Huh?

31:42.942 --> 31:43.776
Chicken.

31:45.695 --> 31:47.363
Horse.

31:50.158 --> 31:51.743
Ahh!

31:54.329 --> 31:55.914
Uh, it rolls well.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.582
The sounds?

32:00.543 --> 32:01.878
Yeah, it works.

32:03.838 --> 32:05.506
Huh?

32:05.590 --> 32:06.424
Huh?

32:07.342 --> 32:09.218
Uh, the lion button's not working.

32:10.136 --> 32:10.970
Yeah.

32:11.054 --> 32:13.681
-I don't know why it won't--
-Yeah, the lion.

32:14.432 --> 32:16.434
Talk to you soon. Sure.

32:17.852 --> 32:21.731
Oh, it, uh-- it was working up until now,
it really was.

32:26.527 --> 32:29.864
So, uh, what if
I bring it down to 30,000 won?

32:30.949 --> 32:32.575
-Thank you!
-Have a good one.

32:32.659 --> 32:33.493
Bye.

32:35.912 --> 32:37.747
Are you sure it's okay to sell that?

32:38.247 --> 32:41.209
It's fine. She'll be walking soon anyway.

32:47.799 --> 32:50.718
So together we have 138,000 won.

32:52.178 --> 32:53.596
This is nowhere near enough.

32:57.225 --> 32:59.143
I don't have anything else to sell.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.020
What do we do now?

33:04.565 --> 33:07.193
Oh-- I could ask my tteokbokki grandma.

33:08.361 --> 33:10.405
-"Tteokbokki grandma"?
-Mm-hmm.

33:11.030 --> 33:14.534
Remember how I said there was an awesome
tteokbokki truck where I used to live?

33:16.035 --> 33:17.745
She's like a real grandma to me.

33:18.413 --> 33:21.165
She told me I should talk to her
if I needed anything.

33:22.417 --> 33:23.668
We could ask her for help.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.842
I kinda think
we could pull this off by ourselves.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.809
Mi-mo, wait a little while.
I'll try to come up with something.

33:40.518 --> 33:42.645
You won't. We'll do it together.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.272
I'll try to find a way too.

33:45.440 --> 33:46.274
Mm-hmm.

33:52.530 --> 33:53.364
Hey.

33:53.906 --> 33:55.658
Can I talk to you for a minute?

33:57.076 --> 33:57.910
Why?

34:02.707 --> 34:04.000
Wow. Are these real?

34:04.584 --> 34:06.794
Hey! Of course they're real.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.588
Do you like them?

34:08.671 --> 34:11.507
So… do you think you wanna get one?

34:12.550 --> 34:13.676
They're 20,000 won,

34:13.760 --> 34:16.763
but you're so cute,
I'll give it to you for half the price.

34:18.264 --> 34:19.640
I don't have the money, though.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.185
How much money do you have?

34:23.644 --> 34:24.896
Five hundred won.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.319
That's okay. I'll take it for now.

34:32.028 --> 34:34.697
In return, tell your friends
about me, huh?

34:34.781 --> 34:35.615
Sure!

34:36.115 --> 34:39.327
-Oh my gosh, that's hilarious.
-What a freakin' joke.

34:39.410 --> 34:42.789
-Kids still do this kinda stuff?
-That's so pathetic.

34:42.872 --> 34:44.832
Hey, you. Is there a problem?

34:44.916 --> 34:47.418
A middle schooler
taking money from a little kid?

34:47.502 --> 34:49.087
You're small, so…

34:49.796 --> 34:51.130
Listen, you little fuck.

34:51.214 --> 34:53.758
Don't take money
from little kids, understood?

34:55.259 --> 34:57.678
Hey, take your 500 won and go home.

35:03.017 --> 35:05.770
-Where do you think you're going?
-Hey, grab her!

35:05.853 --> 35:08.356
-Don't even think about running.
-So sad.

35:18.116 --> 35:20.326
That's what you get.

35:23.329 --> 35:25.373
You ratted me out to them, didn't you?

35:26.290 --> 35:28.459
Bed-wetter.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.838
What did you say?
Aren't you scared of dying?

35:31.921 --> 35:36.134
Let me go! If you keep this up,
you should be scared of dying.

35:36.217 --> 35:38.010
Should I, bitch?

35:38.094 --> 35:40.763
I'm gonna hit you
every time you lie to me, you got that?

35:40.847 --> 35:41.973
Wait!

35:43.683 --> 35:45.434
Mi-mo's mom, you know who she is?

35:45.518 --> 35:48.020
"Mi-mo"? Mi-mo Kim?

35:49.814 --> 35:52.275
What? Is her mom rich or something?

36:16.674 --> 36:17.675
Hey, kid.

36:28.311 --> 36:29.478
SUSEONG POLICE SUBSTATION

36:29.562 --> 36:30.813
How may I help you?

36:35.067 --> 36:37.528
-Oh!
-I told you, didn't I? For the last time.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.989
Uh, ma'am, ma'am. You can't do this here.

36:40.072 --> 36:40.948
Get outta my house!

36:41.032 --> 36:42.366
-Right now, you hear me?
-Hey, hey!

36:42.450 --> 36:44.202
Huh?!

36:44.702 --> 36:46.037
I wasn't planning

36:46.787 --> 36:48.289
on staying with you anyway.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.291
What did you say?!

36:57.089 --> 36:58.174
Hey, kid!

37:12.104 --> 37:15.608
Hey! Where have you been?
Why are you home so late?

37:15.691 --> 37:17.652
I was at a friend's house.

37:18.361 --> 37:21.197
Well, you should've called us
at least, you know?

37:29.538 --> 37:31.123
Ugh, leave me alone!

37:31.999 --> 37:34.585
Have you seen the baby walker? Uh--

37:34.669 --> 37:37.463
Why are you asking me?
Just leave me alone!

37:40.675 --> 37:43.302
-Hasn't seen it?
-She says she hasn't.

37:43.386 --> 37:46.347
Jesus, where on earth did it go?

37:52.478 --> 37:53.437
Hello?

37:54.105 --> 37:55.731
-What are you up to?
-Me?

37:55.815 --> 37:57.608
Mmm, not much. I'm home.

37:59.193 --> 38:01.153
Can I come over to your place tonight?

38:01.237 --> 38:02.446
My place?

38:03.698 --> 38:04.824
My place, why?

38:06.534 --> 38:07.451
You know…

38:08.119 --> 38:09.704
Don't wanna go home, that's all.

38:10.746 --> 38:11.580
Oh…

38:13.624 --> 38:14.583
Is that a no?

38:15.418 --> 38:16.836
Just for the night.

38:20.381 --> 38:23.134
I, uh-- I really want you to, but…

38:24.969 --> 38:27.888
It's just… my dad, uh,
he threw stuff again. It's a mess.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.390
Really? Hey,

38:30.308 --> 38:31.142
are you okay?

38:31.225 --> 38:33.561
Yeah, it's just…
my place is a complete mess.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.230
I wanna run away from home.

38:38.024 --> 38:40.735
Mi-mo, you should go back
to your grandma tonight, and…

38:42.111 --> 38:45.281
and… we can leave… when we're ready.

38:47.908 --> 38:48.868
Okay.

38:48.951 --> 38:51.829
Okay. I'll see you at school tomorrow.

38:58.210 --> 38:59.045
Shit.

39:44.465 --> 39:48.260
Hey, did you hear the news?
About Mi-mo Kim from Class Two?

39:48.344 --> 39:50.096
"Mi-mo Kim"? Who's that?

39:50.179 --> 39:54.100
Well, she transferred here recently,
and she's Mask Girl's daughter.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.976
"Mask Girl"? Who's that?

39:56.727 --> 39:59.897
Y'know, the PangTV psycho killer?
She was on TV and all.

39:59.980 --> 40:01.065
Whoa, really?

40:01.148 --> 40:05.194
Fuckin' unbelievable.
Y'know why she transferred to our school?

40:05.277 --> 40:06.362
Why?

40:06.445 --> 40:08.989
Apparently,
she stabbed a kid with a pencil.

40:09.073 --> 40:11.158
-So…
-What the hell? That's crazy!

40:11.242 --> 40:13.953
That means we go to the same school
as a serial killer's daughter!

40:14.036 --> 40:17.248
My mom's making a complaint
to the Office of Education

40:17.331 --> 40:19.291
to try to get her to leave the school.

40:27.716 --> 40:29.510
-Jeong-guk Kang.
-Here.

40:29.593 --> 40:31.470
-Na-rae Kim.
-Here.

40:31.554 --> 40:32.721
Mi-mo Kim.

40:35.266 --> 40:37.435
Ye-chun. Is Mi-mo late?

40:38.769 --> 40:40.062
I haven't seen her yet.

40:43.732 --> 40:45.651
-Jin-hong Kim.
-Here.

40:45.734 --> 40:47.611
-Ha-eun Kim.
-Here.

40:52.825 --> 40:55.828
MI-MO, WHERE ARE YOU?

40:59.081 --> 41:00.499
-Just a second.
-Mm-hmm.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.584
Ye-chun.

41:03.169 --> 41:04.003
Yes?

41:04.086 --> 41:06.088
Can I have a word with you for a minute?

41:07.756 --> 41:09.508
According to Mi-mo's grandmother,

41:10.092 --> 41:13.012
Mi-mo hasn't come back home
since yesterday, unfortunately.

41:13.762 --> 41:15.598
Do you know anything, by chance?

41:19.560 --> 41:23.689
You're, uh,
Mi-mo's closest friend, isn't that right?

41:24.732 --> 41:26.192
Yeah, that's true.

41:28.027 --> 41:29.570
But I don't know where she is.

41:57.848 --> 42:00.434
The number you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.478
Please leave a message after the tone.

42:12.821 --> 42:16.033
The number you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please leave--

42:16.116 --> 42:18.035
Dang it, why aren't you picking up?

42:24.750 --> 42:26.043
Where the heck are you?

42:28.837 --> 42:30.839
-Ye-chun!
-Ye-chun!

42:31.465 --> 42:33.425
-Hey.
-What's with the long face?

42:33.509 --> 42:34.969
Did something happen at school?

42:35.553 --> 42:36.637
-No, nothing.
-Huh?

42:36.720 --> 42:39.139
We bought fried chicken,
your favorite. Let's go.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.600
-We got fried chicken.
-We bought two boxes. Let's go.

42:41.684 --> 42:43.894
-It'll be a fried chicken party!
-Yay!

42:43.978 --> 42:46.021
Every other day!

42:46.105 --> 42:46.939
So?!

42:47.022 --> 42:50.442
Since our daughter likes chicken,
we can have one every day.

42:50.526 --> 42:54.530
Okay, then. Let's party every day.
Let's have fried chicken tomorrow too!

42:56.699 --> 42:58.117
Why aren't you eating?

42:59.410 --> 43:01.745
I'll give you the leg today.

43:01.829 --> 43:03.998
Usually, we'd auction it off…

43:04.081 --> 43:05.666
…but I'll give it to ya this time.

43:05.749 --> 43:06.792
MI-MO♥

43:07.793 --> 43:10.296
No, no, I'm full. I can't eat anymore.

43:10.921 --> 43:12.339
Wha-- Already?

43:12.423 --> 43:13.966
Well, I'll eat it, then!

43:14.049 --> 43:15.593
Hey, Mi-mo Kim, where are you?

43:16.093 --> 43:17.177
Can you come meet me?

43:18.470 --> 43:20.222
Yeah, of course. Where are you?

43:21.015 --> 43:23.642
Oh, the underpass?
Okay, got it. Stay right there!

43:30.190 --> 43:31.859
Hey! Mi-mo Kim!

43:32.985 --> 43:33.819
Hey!

43:34.695 --> 43:36.572
Do you know how worried I was?

43:37.197 --> 43:39.908
Why did you turn your phone off?

43:47.541 --> 43:48.917
Why are you looking at me

43:49.501 --> 43:50.419
like that?

43:51.253 --> 43:52.212
Mi-mo!

43:53.505 --> 43:54.340
Hey!

43:58.218 --> 43:59.637
How could you do that?

44:00.471 --> 44:01.472
What do you mean?

44:03.265 --> 44:05.851
-You spread the rumors, right?
-"Rumors"?

44:06.352 --> 44:08.103
What are you talking about?

44:09.229 --> 44:11.607
-You spread the rumors about me!
-What rumors?!

44:14.610 --> 44:17.071
How could
you do this to me? How could you?

44:17.154 --> 44:19.865
Hold on!
Mi-mo, why are you doing this?

44:19.948 --> 44:21.533
No, stop!

44:21.617 --> 44:23.702
And you lied to me! You bitch!

44:23.786 --> 44:27.456
Wait, Mi-mo. Listen to me.
I didn't spread any rumors about--

44:27.539 --> 44:30.167
Shut up, you backstabber!
