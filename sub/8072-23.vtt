[music playing]

00:08.109 --> 00:09.643
I am warning you.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.545
Mom, if you don't stop
treating me like a child,

00:11.579 --> 00:14.348
I am packed up and out
of your place by tonight.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.184
That's the coffee
talking, Jackie.

00:16.217 --> 00:17.085
Hold on a second.

00:17.118 --> 00:17.985
What's that?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.720
OK, I'll tell her.

00:19.753 --> 00:21.655
The coffee says you're
a meddling old bat

00:21.689 --> 00:24.325
who's sapping my will to live.

00:24.358 --> 00:27.128
Well I'm sorry if I
care about you, Jackie.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.397
But I watch you every day.

00:29.430 --> 00:33.234
I'm just concerned about this
reckless lifestyle of yours.

00:33.267 --> 00:34.968
Reckless lifestyle?

00:35.002 --> 00:40.474
I am living with my mother
in a retirement community.

00:40.508 --> 00:44.078
Now I see why you have so
much trouble with people.

00:44.112 --> 00:45.646
Not people, mom.

00:45.679 --> 00:47.881
You.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.418
I know you think you
have a terrible mother,

00:50.451 --> 00:52.520
but you should thank
your lucky stars.

00:52.553 --> 00:55.055
There are women out there who
have to go to a psychiatrist

00:55.089 --> 00:57.191
because their mothers
were so horrible.

00:57.225 --> 00:58.326
Surprise, mom.

00:58.359 --> 00:59.160
Twice a week.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.266
Oh, well.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.468
And I suppose you
lie there and talk

01:07.501 --> 01:10.070
about what a bad mother I am.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.506
I just hope I don't run
into this doctor someday.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.608
God knows what
he'll think of me.

01:14.642 --> 01:18.146
First of all, mom, my
therapist is a woman.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.947
Oh, how modern.

01:19.980 --> 01:22.383
And I suppose this
woman teaches you

01:22.416 --> 01:24.485
how to blame everything on me.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.054
No, I already know how
to blame everything on you.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.924
She just tells me I'm right.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.160
Oh, really?

01:32.193 --> 01:33.561
Well fine.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.396
If that's the way you want it,
as of now you have no mother.

01:35.429 --> 01:36.297
Nope!

01:36.330 --> 01:37.198
Nope.

01:37.231 --> 01:39.300
No.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.969
The sick, sadistic
games aren't going

01:42.002 --> 01:43.804
to work on me anymore, mom.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.173
You no longer have
any control over me.

01:45.206 --> 01:46.073
Got it?

01:46.106 --> 01:48.476
I do not allow it in my life.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.817
[cash register beeping]

02:05.793 --> 02:08.762
What, what is it now?

02:08.796 --> 02:10.198
I'm sorry Jackie.

02:10.231 --> 02:11.565
You're right.

02:11.599 --> 02:14.101
I don't know why I
say the things I say.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.769
There must be something
wrong with me.

02:15.803 --> 02:16.670
Mom--

02:16.704 --> 02:19.840
No, it's true, Jackie.

02:19.873 --> 02:22.443
I just reached a
point in my life

02:22.476 --> 02:25.713
where I have to
admit a few things.

02:25.746 --> 02:29.317
I drove your father away.

02:29.350 --> 02:33.854
And now it seems you and
Roseanne don't want me around.

02:33.887 --> 02:37.525
Maybe I deserve to spend
the rest of my life alone.

02:37.558 --> 02:38.926
Oh, mom.

02:38.959 --> 02:42.763
It's not all your fault. It's
just that my problem is I blame

02:42.796 --> 02:44.232
my mistakes on other people.

02:44.265 --> 02:45.833
It's just-- it's--

02:45.866 --> 02:47.601
it's not you mom, it's me.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.502
It's me.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.304
It's all me.

02:50.338 --> 02:53.941
I'm just no good.

02:53.974 --> 02:56.410
You know, Jackie
I think I was wrong.

02:56.444 --> 03:01.114
This therapy is
working out very well.

03:01.148 --> 03:05.052
[music playing]

03:52.966 --> 03:55.035
They paved the
whole sidewalk there,

03:55.068 --> 03:56.036
and they built the porch.

03:56.069 --> 03:59.072
But the doorbell
here, that's my idea.

03:59.106 --> 04:02.310
Because that's only like
$1.50 at the store, but it

04:02.343 --> 04:04.945
adds $3 value to the house.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.014
Roseanne, Roger's got
a live one in the back.

04:07.047 --> 04:09.550
Hey DJ, why don't you ride your
bike past the bedroom window.

04:09.583 --> 04:10.951
It will make the
neighborhood look quaint.

04:10.984 --> 04:14.555
Yeah, but watch out for all
those crackheads on the corner.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.358
Really nice built ins.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.159
Man, I've been
after you for 15 years

04:19.192 --> 04:20.894
to build me shelves like this.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.731
They were supposed to go next
to my entertainment center.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.533
What entertainment center?

04:25.566 --> 04:28.669
That entertainment center.

04:28.702 --> 04:32.540
God, Dan, it's like you're
cheating on our house.

04:32.573 --> 04:34.708
Dan, he really loves what
you did to the kitchen.

04:34.742 --> 04:38.646
All those big cabinets, the
tiled countertops, spice rack.

04:38.679 --> 04:40.914
Spice rack?

04:40.948 --> 04:41.949
You bastard.

04:41.982 --> 04:45.052
It was only the
little one, honey.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.921
Hey, I'm going in here, and I
had better not find any ironing

04:55.228 --> 04:56.096
Come with me.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.231
Tell her you did it.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.267

look great, Roger.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.635
Thank you.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.637
Would you like the grand tour?

05:03.671 --> 05:05.539
I could show you
around the house.

05:05.573 --> 05:08.008
You could show me
around Lanford.

on Friday night.

05:11.011 --> 05:12.346

05:16.283 --> 05:18.452

05:18.486 --> 05:21.389
All three of them, yes.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.392
But ours is a completely
casual relationship.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.360
I can date other women.

05:26.394 --> 05:27.428
She can date other women.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.401
You know, Roger, Nancy
is a casual type of person.

05:33.434 --> 05:37.204
But I'm a real uptight, do
it by the rules kind of gal.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.473
And one of the rules is,
never date your lesbian

05:39.507 --> 05:42.510
friend's boyfriend.

05:42.543 --> 05:44.512
Roseanne, you're making
too big a deal out of this.

05:44.545 --> 05:47.214
You even painted
the names on, Dan.

05:47.247 --> 05:50.718
The pepper place, the oregano
place, the salt place.

05:50.751 --> 05:52.119
I promise you'll get one.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.020
When, Dan?

05:53.053 --> 05:55.556
When will I get my pepper place?

05:55.589 --> 05:57.591
I swear, Dan said he was going
to build you one, Roseanne.

Absolutely.

Excuse us, everyone.

Hey, hi.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.137
Hi.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.175
Man, we're cutting
it pretty close.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.944
Only five days before
the mortgage is due.

06:16.977 --> 06:18.746
Well don't worry
about it, because Roger

06:18.779 --> 06:21.314
can sell anything to anybody.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.984
Look what he sold Nancy.

06:24.017 --> 06:27.855
Look, chaps, I think we
should stay here awhile, in case

06:27.888 --> 06:29.523
some other people come by.

06:29.557 --> 06:32.025
Oh, well sure.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.561
He didn't like the
back yard, did he?

06:33.594 --> 06:34.762
No, he liked the back yard.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.329
So then what, the
house is too small?

06:36.363 --> 06:38.331
No, he liked the house.

06:38.365 --> 06:41.669
We should stay here so we
can tell the other people

06:41.702 --> 06:45.172
the house is already sold!

06:45.205 --> 06:48.175
Roger, I'm going to kiss you.

06:48.208 --> 06:49.643
No, Dan, you're not.

06:49.677 --> 06:50.544
Ah, kiss me.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.714
Congratulations, you guys!

06:53.747 --> 06:55.282
Hey yeah, well what about me?

06:55.315 --> 06:57.184
You know, I'm the one
that forced Dan to get

06:57.217 --> 06:58.385
involved in the first place.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.887
Yes, you did, honey.

Men, let's hear it
for being whipped.

You did great work here guys.

Thank you my friend.

This is it.

we're rich, I don't

I want a store bought one.

I still had an ounce
of self esteem left.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.285
Oh, Jackie, it's
your own fault

07:32.319 --> 07:34.688
for telling her about your
shrink in the first place.

07:34.722 --> 07:36.023
I was cornered.

07:36.056 --> 07:37.491
I had to hurt her.

07:37.525 --> 07:39.126
Move out, Jackie.

I know you're afraid to get out
there and mix, but you know,

the world is a lot
less scary than mom.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.401
Jackie, Roseanne,
what do you think?

07:48.435 --> 07:50.738
I think it could
be a little snug.

07:50.771 --> 07:51.639
It's not for me.

07:51.672 --> 07:53.173
It's for my baby.

07:53.206 --> 07:56.376
Oh, Nancy, are you
dressing up that cat again?

07:56.409 --> 07:59.446
No, I think I'm
going to be pregnant.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.814
What do you mean
by going to be?

08:00.848 --> 08:02.683
Well, it means I really
want to have a baby,

08:02.716 --> 08:04.952
and Roger's going
to be the father.

to have a baby?

08:06.887 --> 08:07.755
I don't know.

08:07.788 --> 08:08.822
I haven't asked him.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.323
I don't really care.

08:10.357 --> 08:14.494
As soon as I get pregnant, I'm
going to end the relationship.

08:14.528 --> 08:17.097
You're not even taking his
feelings into consideration,

08:17.130 --> 08:21.134
you're treating him like
he's some sperm dispenser?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.603
That's not true.

08:22.636 --> 08:25.973
Roger's a very special person,
and he has a great teeth.

08:29.977 --> 08:31.411
Huh.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.080
I can't even believe
she's doing that.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.048
I mean what is she going to
tell the kid when it comes

out with a British accent?

baby in the little stretch

08:45.358 --> 08:47.260
Well, maybe we're not
being fair to Nancy.

08:47.294 --> 08:50.263
People change, maybe
having a baby is a sign she

is becoming less self-involved?

the this stroller.

get those jelly beans?

From the bin at the store.

DJ, I told you, you've
got to finish eating them

or else it's stealing.

I'm sorry.

Well you put those
back in your pocket.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.200
When we go shopping
again next week,

09:27.234 --> 09:28.468
you put them back in the bin.

Hey.

Hey, what's the good word?

09:39.279 --> 09:42.850
Uh, maybe you didn't
hear the question?

09:42.883 --> 09:43.917
He didn't even give a reason.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.118
He just changes his mind.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.419
Now I've got to figure
out how the hell

09:46.453 --> 09:48.555
I'm going to pay the bills
for all the supplies.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.891
Well, so, you just
go to Roger and get

09:50.924 --> 09:52.726
him to front you the money
until the house sells.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.562
I can't do that, he's an
important business contact.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.365
I don't want to look like
some bum asking for a handout.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.234
Well then wear a tie.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.036
I'm not going to do it.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.371
I'll go to the
lumber yard and ask

10:04.404 --> 10:06.039
for 30 more days on my credit.

10:06.073 --> 10:08.776
The house is bound
to sell by then.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.044
And what if you can't
get the extension?

10:11.078 --> 10:13.647
Well, then I'll finally have
the time to build those shelves

10:13.681 --> 10:14.982
you've been wanting.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.316
Of course, they'll
be freestanding

the field will be living in.

time I'm bringing

groceries into this house.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.460
You got that right.

10:27.494 --> 10:30.831
[music playing]

10:34.334 --> 10:36.770
I never thought I'd say this.

10:36.804 --> 10:37.738
I'm too depressed to drink.

10:40.573 --> 10:45.378
You know, I'm really sorry
I got you into this, Dan.

10:45.412 --> 10:47.748
You can't blame yourself.

10:47.781 --> 10:51.351
Listen, life's worth nothing
if you don't take risks.

10:51.384 --> 10:55.188
Of course, we took the risk,
we're still worth nothing.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.925
You, Anne Marie and I
haven't worked in 10 months.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.226
If this thing
doesn't sell, I don't

10:59.259 --> 11:00.427
know how we're going to live.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.129
Hey, I owe a ton of
money to a lumber yard.

11:02.162 --> 11:04.664
I don't know if
I'm going to live.

11:04.698 --> 11:07.467
I'm in way more
trouble than you are.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.602
At least Roseanne
has a business.

11:09.636 --> 11:11.739
Wish I had a wife
who would carry me.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.710
Roseanne doesn't carry me.

11:16.744 --> 11:18.746
Oh, come on, Dan.

11:18.779 --> 11:20.680
It's not a big deal.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.615
Yeah it is.

11:22.649 --> 11:25.318
You're saying I
can't support myself.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.420
I didn't say can't.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.489
I said don't.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.792
Hey Chuck, you know what?

11:31.825 --> 11:33.293
Remember a while ago
when I said you shouldn't

11:33.326 --> 11:34.694
blame yourself for all this?

11:34.728 --> 11:35.695
I was wrong.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.165
You go and play
yourself all you want.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.699
Hey look, it's not
my fault that you're

11:39.733 --> 11:41.869
so stupid you jump
into a business deal

11:41.902 --> 11:43.771
and don't have the
money to back it up.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.939
Hey, nobody calls me
stupid in this house

11:45.973 --> 11:48.441
that doesn't live there!

11:48.475 --> 11:49.576
Well, fine!

11:49.609 --> 11:51.845
I'll go outside and yell
it through the window!

11:51.879 --> 11:53.046
Here's a hint.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.016
A window's a square thing
with the glass in it.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.951
Oh, oh, are you trying
to say I don't know

11:57.985 --> 11:59.352
anything about construction?

11:59.386 --> 12:03.356
No, everybody puts a
fuse box in a shower.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.826
I thought it was a closet.

12:05.859 --> 12:09.229
The way you build them, it's
hard to tell the difference.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.598
Hey.
We're not done yet.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.632
Hey, hey.

12:12.665 --> 12:15.235
That's my shoulder, man.

12:15.268 --> 12:18.538
- You sure it's not a closet?
- Look, I'm warning you.

12:18.571 --> 12:19.739
Don't touch me, Connor.

12:19.773 --> 12:20.841
Who's going to stop me?

12:20.874 --> 12:22.109
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.243
You're going to break my house.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.012
What the hell's going on?

12:25.045 --> 12:26.113
We didn't get the extension.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.548
Thanks to this jerk here
were out five grand.

12:28.581 --> 12:29.449
Well gee, Dan.

12:29.482 --> 12:30.784
This is an emergency.

12:30.818 --> 12:33.020
You might have to go
out and get a job.

12:33.053 --> 12:33.954
Whoa, you.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.555
In the house.

12:35.588 --> 12:39.793
You go home and tell your mom
you can't play here no more.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.661
What are you doing
fighting with your best

12:41.694 --> 12:43.063
friend over some business deal?

12:43.096 --> 12:45.032
And why didn't you
get that extension?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.566
Oh, you're the one who
told me we should get

12:46.599 --> 12:47.700
into this in the first place.

12:47.734 --> 12:49.069
No, no, no, no.

12:49.102 --> 12:52.806
What I told you is that you
should not use me as an excuse

12:52.840 --> 12:53.941
not to do it.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.809
OK?

12:55.843 --> 12:58.311
Besides, in my version
we become zillionaires.

12:58.345 --> 13:01.949
And everyone we hate is crushed
under our immense wealth.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.951
[knock at the door]

13:03.984 --> 13:06.053
If all was running
true to form,

13:06.086 --> 13:07.420
that should be the
Angel of Death.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.624
Huh.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.127
Close.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.662
Danny, I have wonderful news.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.330
Thank god, you've
sold the house.

13:17.364 --> 13:18.598
Nope, better than that.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.101
You know that big old
Victorian on Pine and Central?

13:21.134 --> 13:23.136
My contractor dropped out.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.271
Absolute wimp.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.206
No vision.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.241
So I'm offering you
first shot at this.

13:28.275 --> 13:31.011
All we need is an extra
$5,000 to meet on our nut.

13:31.044 --> 13:34.414
Sorry, Roger,
Dan's out of nuts.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.983
Roseanne, this
is a sure thing.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.350
We can make twice
as much as we're

13:37.384 --> 13:38.685
making on the other place.

13:38.718 --> 13:42.822
Well, let's see 2
times 0 is not enough.

13:42.856 --> 13:45.592
We've got to make at
least 4 times zero.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.729
Listen, Rog, the bill for the
lumber yard's due any minute.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.498
I was going to ask
you to float me a loan

13:51.531 --> 13:54.001
until the house sells.

13:54.034 --> 13:57.704
Dan, Daniel, Danny.

13:57.737 --> 13:58.705
You're a great talker.

13:58.738 --> 13:59.940
You can get more credit.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.408
It's just paper.

14:01.441 --> 14:05.212
Rog, Roger, Roggie.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.947
It's just food on the table.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.215
I mean, come on.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.917
We're not even sure the
first place is going to sell.

14:09.950 --> 14:10.850
What are you saying?

14:10.884 --> 14:12.485
I don't know how
to sell the place?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.054
I can sell anything.

14:14.087 --> 14:16.957
I've even sold hovels
worse than this one.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.191
Whoa, Dan.

14:18.225 --> 14:22.996
Robin Leach here is
beginning to lose his charm.

14:23.030 --> 14:25.665
I didn't mean that, I'm sorry.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.936
I can be such a beast.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.272
I just don't want to
lose you as partners.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.075
What can I do to help you.

14:35.108 --> 14:36.343
You can buy me out.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.877
Oh, you can't
pull out now, Dan.

14:37.911 --> 14:40.147
Not after you put it
all that hard work.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.083
There must be some way you
can put these people off.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.684
Just don't answer the phone.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.818
Oh, yeah right.

14:45.852 --> 14:46.954
Or when they come
up to the door,

14:46.987 --> 14:48.255
we'll turn all the lights off.

14:48.288 --> 14:51.258
Or we won't sign
the check, or we'll

14:51.291 --> 14:52.725
leave the envelope
unsealed so they

14:52.759 --> 14:54.995
think the check fell out of it.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.264
I'm sorry Roger, but we're
not that kind of people.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.005
Well, fair enough.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.841
I'll come by tomorrow with a
cashier's check for $5,000.

15:08.875 --> 15:11.278
And I tell you what,
for the extra time

15:11.311 --> 15:12.712
and sweat that you
put into the place,

15:12.745 --> 15:15.515
I'll throw in another $2,000.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.917
I don't want to lose our
friendship over this one deal.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.556
All right then.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.859
See you tomorrow.

15:26.893 --> 15:29.196
You don't have to give us the
extra $2,000, Roger, I'm way

15:29.229 --> 15:30.230
too proud to take your money.

15:33.233 --> 15:36.536
[music playing]

15:38.105 --> 15:39.039
[door knocking]

15:39.072 --> 15:41.741
What the hell was that?

15:41.774 --> 15:45.945
Roseanne, Roger left me.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.880
I can't believe it.
How could he do this to me?

15:47.914 --> 15:49.983
How could he be so insensitive.

15:50.017 --> 15:52.519
I didn't even have
a chance to ovulate.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.653
I don't understand.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.955
And I don't want to.

15:55.989 --> 15:58.191
I really felt like we
were right for each other.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.192
Oh, I know.

15:59.226 --> 16:02.629
You think you're
using the right guy.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.565
And he left with
the $5,000 I gave him.

16:05.598 --> 16:06.466
What?

16:06.499 --> 16:08.668
He left the apartment?

16:08.701 --> 16:10.437
Or he left town?

16:10.470 --> 16:12.005
Both.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.741
What happened to the hugging?

16:14.774 --> 16:16.843
Nancy, are you sure he's gone?

16:16.876 --> 16:19.779
Yeah, I went by his
place and it's empty.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.781
And I talked to his landlady,
and he left the key.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.151
Oh man, this is unbelievable.

16:24.184 --> 16:26.186
I'm going to kill him.

16:26.219 --> 16:29.456
It's so sweet of you two to
be concerned, but I'll be OK.

16:29.489 --> 16:31.458
Really.

16:31.491 --> 16:35.195
Nancy, we're not
talking about you.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.264
He conned us out of five grand.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.766
And now we get to
unload that house.

16:39.799 --> 16:44.504
I can't believe he did
this to you, my friends.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.239
I think you should
track him down.

16:46.273 --> 16:49.342
And when you do you tell
him, I'm really hurt.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.712
And that I'm just stupid enough
to have sex with him one more

16:52.745 --> 16:53.546
time.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.186
Oh, man, we're screwed.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.520
No, Dan.

17:00.553 --> 17:04.724
We are so far beyond screwed
that the light from screwed

17:04.757 --> 17:09.028
will take 1 billion
years to reach the Earth.

17:09.062 --> 17:12.399
[music playing]

17:25.778 --> 17:27.080
Dan, what are you
doing here so early?

17:27.114 --> 17:28.715
Roseanne doesn't
come in until noon.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.818
I know, I kind of needed
to talk to you alone, Bev.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.957
Listen, Bev, need to borrow
$5,000 until that house sells.

17:37.990 --> 17:39.626
Now, you know I'd
rather do anything

17:39.659 --> 17:41.828
than beg you for money.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.430
But you're the only
person I know that can't

17:43.463 --> 17:44.864
possibly think any less of me.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.403
Well Dan, this
is uncomfortable.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.705
I don't want to be the one
you turn to every time you

17:52.739 --> 17:54.474
have a little financial crisis.

17:54.507 --> 17:55.842
I don't blame you.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.710
This reminds me
of the little story

17:57.744 --> 18:00.213
of the grasshopper and the ant.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.681
Oh, yeah, they
walked into the bar

18:01.714 --> 18:02.749
with the rabbi and the priest.

18:05.852 --> 18:09.522
The grasshopper, if
I remember correctly,

18:09.556 --> 18:12.425
played all summer
while the little ant

18:12.459 --> 18:15.995
toiled and toiled, saving food.

18:16.028 --> 18:18.965
But when winter came,
that silly grasshopper

18:18.998 --> 18:23.770
would have starved to death,
but the kindly ant took him in.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.873
The grasshopper enjoyed
today, but never

18:26.906 --> 18:29.776
gave a thought to the
cold, cold, winter to come.

18:29.809 --> 18:32.645
Do you understand
what I'm saying, Dan?

18:32.679 --> 18:35.515
Yes Beverly, I
am a grasshopper.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.922
But someday I hope to
be an ant like you.

18:42.955 --> 18:45.492
Thanks for waking me up, mom.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.527
You said you didn't
want me to, that I

18:47.560 --> 18:49.362
was treating you like a child.

18:49.396 --> 18:52.565
I know what you're doing mom.

18:52.599 --> 18:53.933
You may not know
what you're doing,

18:53.966 --> 18:55.435
but I know what you're doing.

18:55.468 --> 18:59.272
You let me sleep in so you can
rag on me for showing up late.

18:59.306 --> 19:01.908
You know, Jackie, I don't
think you need a psychiatrist.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.677
I think what you need
is a good alarm clock.

19:04.711 --> 19:05.678
No, mom.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.381
What I need is to
get away from you.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.082
I'm an adult, it's time
I had a place of my own.

19:10.116 --> 19:12.185
Dan, I'm going to
buy that old house.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.258
Are you sure about this?

19:18.291 --> 19:19.959
I've never been so sure
about anything in my life.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.094
I'd like to move in immediately.

19:22.128 --> 19:23.263
Let me get this straight.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.964
This is a deal, right?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.499
It's a deal.

19:26.533 --> 19:31.103
Jackie, you have no idea
what those words mean to me.

19:31.137 --> 19:31.971
So, Beverly.

19:39.045 --> 19:41.748
Where in the hell do you
get off talking to me

19:41.781 --> 19:44.684
like I'm some piece of dirt.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.887
You forgot the last chapter
in your little story.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.423
The grasshopper comes back with
his old buddy, the anteater.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.496
And after he's finished
sucking the little man

19:56.529 --> 20:00.032
up his long snout, he
spits her out because she's

20:00.066 --> 20:01.268
so old and bitter.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.674
I wish you hadn't
have done that, Dan.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.008
Who do you think I'm
going to ask to borrow

20:09.041 --> 20:09.876
the down payment from?

20:19.419 --> 20:22.088
Listen, Bev.

20:22.121 --> 20:25.358
[music playing]

20:29.629 --> 20:30.497
Oh, man.

20:30.530 --> 20:33.400
We are screwed.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.302
Oh.

20:35.335 --> 20:38.671
We should have known something
like this was going to happen.

20:38.705 --> 20:42.174
Yeah, after all,
we are involved.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.511
You know where we
made our mistake?

20:44.544 --> 20:46.479
We should never have thrown
out that chain letter.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.885
If we'd only sent
$100 to total strangers,

20:52.919 --> 20:54.053
we could have made us a fortune.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.592
No, well, I'm
thinking about them

20:59.626 --> 21:03.630
bridge we could have bought
over there in New York City.

21:03.663 --> 21:09.235
Oh, she was a dandy
bit bridge all right.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.703
You know, Dan.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.540
I think if we had
moved fast, we can

21:13.573 --> 21:16.576
get right in on that pyramid
scheme sweeping Lanford.

21:16.609 --> 21:19.846
We could own our very
own damn pyramid.

21:19.879 --> 21:24.283
You mean like the ones
up to Egypt, Africa?

21:24.317 --> 21:26.686
Hot ziggity dog.

21:26.719 --> 21:30.256
