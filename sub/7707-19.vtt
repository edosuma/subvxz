WEBVTT

00:05.039 --> 00:08.240
- Good morning.
- Morning, Willie, Kate.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.608
Hi, ALF.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.844
- What are you cooking?
- It's a surprise.

00:11.846 --> 00:14.346
- Oh, no.
- Relax.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.316
It's just my
June bug scaloppini.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.687
Hence the crackling noise.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.758
You're frying June bugs?

00:25.760 --> 00:26.892
Please, Willie.

00:26.894 --> 00:28.827
You fry caterpillars.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.864
June bugs you<i> saute.</i>

00:33.534 --> 00:35.200
Go, sit.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.204
Good morning.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.305
Hi, Lynnie.

00:40.307 --> 00:42.408
Mm, what smells so good?

00:42.410 --> 00:44.610
June bug scaloppini.

00:44.612 --> 00:47.146
I'll grab juice.

00:47.148 --> 00:50.883
[sniffing]
ALF, do you have
something in the oven?

00:50.885 --> 00:53.252
Brian's history book.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.686
What?

00:54.688 --> 00:56.021
Someone accidentally knocked it

00:56.023 --> 00:58.757
into his fish tank, Willie.

00:58.759 --> 01:00.559
I didn't do it!

01:00.561 --> 01:03.028
I didn't say you did. I did it.

01:03.030 --> 01:05.230
So I put it in the oven to dry.

01:06.901 --> 01:08.767
Dad, he's kidding.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.574
Oh, no! No!

01:15.576 --> 01:17.976
I'm, I'm doomed!

01:17.978 --> 01:19.578
You got that right.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.046
For Melmacians

01:21.048 --> 01:24.716
it's bad luck
to destroy a history book.

01:24.718 --> 01:28.454
You mean, bad luck like when
you open an umbrella indoors?

01:28.456 --> 01:33.392
Worse. Bad luck
like jilting a Mafia princess.

01:34.595 --> 01:37.296
ALF, that is just silly.

01:37.298 --> 01:38.664
[fire crackling]

01:38.666 --> 01:40.966
[screams]

01:40.968 --> 01:43.769
June bug<i> flambe,</i> anyone?

01:45.206 --> 01:47.206
[theme music]

02:16.470 --> 02:18.470
[music continues]

02:46.834 --> 02:48.133
[instrumental music]

02:52.439 --> 02:54.773
My history book is history.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.176
My life is history.

02:57.178 --> 02:59.545
I'm an accursed Melmacian.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.880
I belong in the realm of the..

03:01.882 --> 03:04.082
...gosh darned.

03:05.519 --> 03:07.686
"Gosh darned?"

03:07.688 --> 03:10.489
Ours was a polite society.

03:10.491 --> 03:14.092
That fire wasn't the result
of any curse.

03:14.094 --> 03:17.229
How do you explain
the timing of that disaster?

03:17.231 --> 03:18.931
It's been a couple of hours
since your last one.

03:18.933 --> 03:20.799
You were due.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.434
It's the curse!

03:22.436 --> 03:24.002
It was a coincidence.

03:24.004 --> 03:26.371
Oh, yeah?
That's an electric stove.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.775
They're not usually
prone to fires.

03:29.777 --> 03:32.711
You must have spilled grease
on it when you were<i> sauteing.</i>

03:32.713 --> 03:35.581
You miss my point!

03:35.583 --> 03:36.782
[gasps]

03:36.784 --> 03:41.753
My hand is impaled on a fork.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.655
Oh!

03:43.657 --> 03:47.359
I don't get it. Why is it
bad luck to burn a history book?

03:47.361 --> 03:51.096
Because Melmacians have
a great respect for books.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.265
If you destroy a history book

03:53.267 --> 03:54.866
you cheat future generations

03:54.868 --> 03:57.569
out of knowledge of the past.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.372
That's rather deep
for a planet whose motto was

04:00.374 --> 04:03.108
"Are you going to finish
that sandwich."

04:04.445 --> 04:07.713
Hey, I don't make fun
of your stupid planet.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.449
Electoral college.

04:10.451 --> 04:13.452
How long is this curse thing
supposed to last?

04:13.454 --> 04:16.154
I'm looking at
seven years of bad luck

04:16.156 --> 04:17.689
followed by seven years

04:17.691 --> 04:21.059
of<i> really</i> bad luck.

04:21.061 --> 04:23.362
[instrumental music]

04:23.364 --> 04:25.364
[thudding]

04:27.268 --> 04:28.834
Not again.

04:28.836 --> 04:29.968
(ALF)
Oh!

04:29.970 --> 04:31.670
- Oh!
- ALF?

04:31.672 --> 04:33.105
Are you alright?

04:33.107 --> 04:35.774
Oh, about as well as I was
the other four times

04:35.776 --> 04:39.311
I fell down the attic stairs.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.680
Well, you've been so quiet
for the last hour or so

04:41.682 --> 04:45.784
I thought maybe you were
over this bad-luck thing.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.219
I was unconscious.

04:47.221 --> 04:49.454
I hit my head on a rafter.

04:50.691 --> 04:54.593
Relax, dad.
In 14 years, it'll all be over.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.762
Oh, he's just being careless.

04:56.764 --> 04:58.330
I am not!

04:58.332 --> 05:01.133
I'm accursed!

05:01.135 --> 05:03.935
You ever heard the saying,
"Superstition is the religion

05:03.937 --> 05:06.571
of feeble minds?"

05:06.573 --> 05:08.807
Sounds good to me.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.875
[knocking on door]

05:09.877 --> 05:10.909
(Jake)
'It's me!'

05:10.911 --> 05:12.577
Oh, come on in, Jake!

05:12.579 --> 05:14.012
[door opens and closes]

05:14.014 --> 05:16.648
Hi, ALF, I heard about
your run of bad luck.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.716
How ya doin'?

05:17.718 --> 05:20.118
Ah! Ah.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.087
Fine, until you touched

05:22.089 --> 05:25.023
where Willie's
trophy collection fell on me.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.159
You broke my trophies?

05:27.161 --> 05:28.794
Just the Math Club trophy.

05:28.796 --> 05:31.196
The Science Club trophy is fine.

05:31.198 --> 05:34.099
[clanging]
Will you be careful?

05:34.101 --> 05:36.068
I am being careful!

05:36.070 --> 05:38.337
This thing
is bigger than all of us.

05:38.339 --> 05:39.838
Isn't there anything you can do

05:39.840 --> 05:41.573
to stop all this curse stuff?

05:41.575 --> 05:45.410
Well, there was one thing
I could've done back on Melmac.

05:45.412 --> 05:48.780
- What?
- The bibliocide ritual.

05:48.782 --> 05:52.117
Basically, it's a ceremony
where I ask atonement

05:52.119 --> 05:54.920
in front of people wearing meat.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.521
Meat?

05:56.523 --> 05:58.857
Meat.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.392
Well, why don't we do that?

06:00.394 --> 06:03.462
One reason comes
almost immediately to mind.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.732
We can't do it, anyway.

06:06.734 --> 06:09.735
The accursed person
has to stand in the light

06:09.737 --> 06:12.604
of a green full moon.

06:12.606 --> 06:15.073
Isn't there anything else
you can do?

06:15.075 --> 06:16.808
Wait it out.

06:16.810 --> 06:20.011
- For 14 years?
- Yeah.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.347
Boy, am I gonna be
hard to live with.

06:22.349 --> 06:25.417
Come on, ALF, I'll buy you
a peanut butter sandwich.

06:25.419 --> 06:29.121
Okay, as long as you know
the Heimlich maneuver.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.259
Dad..

06:34.261 --> 06:35.994
...we have to help him.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.496
He's only having bad luck

06:37.498 --> 06:40.465
because he<i> thinks </i>
he's going to have bad luck.

06:40.467 --> 06:42.134
He'll get over it.

06:42.136 --> 06:45.670
Maybe we could make him think
that he's gonna have good luck.

06:45.672 --> 06:48.373
[shattering]

06:48.375 --> 06:51.476
(ALF)
'Remove it slowly.'

06:53.680 --> 06:54.880
- Lynn?
- Hmm?

06:54.882 --> 06:56.548
Never have aliens.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.520
[instrumental music]

07:06.727 --> 07:09.394
¶ Nobody knows ¶

07:09.396 --> 07:12.597
¶ The trouble I've seen ¶

07:12.599 --> 07:15.000
¶ Nobody knows ¶

07:15.002 --> 07:18.804
¶ My sorrow ¶

07:18.806 --> 07:20.939
¶ Nobody knows ¶¶

07:20.941 --> 07:23.375
Um, ALF?

07:23.377 --> 07:26.344
Is this what all that
hammering was about?

07:26.346 --> 07:31.817
Yes. This is my home
for the next 14 years.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.552
What happened?

07:33.554 --> 07:37.456
Oh, the roof fell on my head
while I was installing it.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.357
And I slammed my hand
in the door

07:39.359 --> 07:42.294
when I locked myself up.

07:42.296 --> 07:43.929
Not to mention
the several hundred

07:43.931 --> 07:45.163
splinters I got

07:45.165 --> 07:48.433
building the gosh darned thing.

07:48.435 --> 07:50.569
- Ours was a polite--
- 'We know.'

07:50.571 --> 07:51.770
We know.

07:51.772 --> 07:55.006
ALF...come on.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.074
Come on out.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.175
I can't.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.144
Do you feel safer in there?

07:59.146 --> 08:01.713
No. I sprained my ankle.

08:03.750 --> 08:05.116
We want to cure you.

08:05.118 --> 08:07.152
We have an idea that might work.
Right, dad?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.488
Yeah, we do. Sure do.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.390
Um, we-we'll cancel out
your curse.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.259
All you have to do
is do something

08:14.261 --> 08:16.695
that's considered lucky
on Earth.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.731
This idea sounds
rather far-fetched.

08:19.733 --> 08:23.902
Well, fine.
See you in 14 years, pal.

08:23.904 --> 08:25.704
Well, alright, alright!

08:25.706 --> 08:28.807
Maybe your idea's more
nearly-fetched than I thought.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.545
[scrapes]

08:33.547 --> 08:37.516
Make that several hundred
and one splinters.

08:37.518 --> 08:40.151
Uh!

08:40.153 --> 08:44.122
- Here, take this.
- Salt?

08:44.124 --> 08:46.157
On our planet,
it's lucky to throw salt

08:46.159 --> 08:48.126
over your shoulder.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.095
- Ow!
- Sorry.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.496
[grunts]

08:54.101 --> 08:56.167
Throw the salt..

08:56.169 --> 08:58.236
...not the saltshaker.

08:58.238 --> 09:00.171
But I always throw the shaker.

09:00.173 --> 09:02.274
And what do I always say?

09:02.276 --> 09:05.443
"Don't throw the shaker."

09:05.445 --> 09:07.979
Maybe if you do something
that's bad luck here

09:07.981 --> 09:09.781
it'll cancel out your bad luck.

09:09.783 --> 09:11.082
Oh, come on, Lynn.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.117
Sounds good to me.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.152
Come on, let's try it.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.660
It's bad luck
to break a mirror.

09:21.662 --> 09:22.794
Give it a shot.

09:25.399 --> 09:27.899
[glass shattering]

09:27.901 --> 09:30.035
Do you feel any luckier?

09:30.037 --> 09:31.369
No.

09:31.371 --> 09:34.472
This was Kate's mirror.

09:34.474 --> 09:38.276
Well, here. Here, try this.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.211
I can't break that.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.479
Just walk underneath it.

09:41.481 --> 09:44.716
That's also considered
bad luck here.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.384
Well, okay.

09:46.386 --> 09:47.986
[crunching]
Oh! Ow!

09:47.988 --> 09:49.654
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- What's wrong?

09:49.656 --> 09:51.590
Oh, I stepped
on a piece of broken glass!

09:51.592 --> 09:52.624
Are you alright?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.492
Well, the glass
doesn't hurt much

09:54.494 --> 09:57.395
but the salt
that's seeping into the wound

09:57.397 --> 10:00.231
hurts like
a martian head noogie.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.700
[groans]

10:01.702 --> 10:04.502
- I'll get you a bandage.
- Good idea.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.438
I was getting tired
of falling down the stairs

10:06.440 --> 10:07.839
every time I needed one.

10:07.841 --> 10:08.873
[Willie groaning]

10:08.875 --> 10:10.041
[thudding]

10:10.043 --> 10:11.943
Uh-h-h.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.978
Oh.

10:12.980 --> 10:14.012
[instrumental music]

10:14.014 --> 10:15.246
Ah.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.854
- Does it still hurt?
- No, no.

10:22.856 --> 10:24.356
Only when you laugh, right?

10:24.358 --> 10:26.558
[chuckles]
Yeah.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.928
What happened?

10:29.930 --> 10:32.163
(ALF)
Willie's dead!

10:32.165 --> 10:33.798
(Willie)
I'm not dead.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.533
Dad fell down the stairs.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.636
Are you sure you don't want me
to call a doctor?

10:37.638 --> 10:40.739
No, no, I'm just
a little shook up.

10:40.741 --> 10:42.807
- Okay.
- Don't listen to him.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.609
He's dead!

10:44.611 --> 10:46.311
I think that
falling down the stairs

10:46.313 --> 10:48.913
has affected you.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.382
No, it hasn't.

10:50.384 --> 10:52.784
But this is
what I feared the most.

10:52.786 --> 10:53.985
What?

10:53.987 --> 10:55.520
In severe cases

10:55.522 --> 10:57.422
the bad luck spreads to people

10:57.424 --> 11:00.792
the accursed one
comes in contact with.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.560
It's starting.

11:02.562 --> 11:05.397
Nothing is starting.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.599
I fell down the stairs

11:07.601 --> 11:10.935
because I had salt in my eyes.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.772
Now, I don't wanna hear
anything more about this curse.

11:13.774 --> 11:15.774
[TV crackling]

11:18.578 --> 11:20.512
I won't say a word.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.916
[instrumental music]

11:27.487 --> 11:28.853
[instrumental music]

11:33.293 --> 11:36.895
Hurry up.
I'm missing my show.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.064
How's the picture?

11:39.066 --> 11:40.965
<i> Perfecto.</i>

11:40.967 --> 11:43.635
Then I guess it was
just a short in the plug.

11:43.637 --> 11:46.104
Try to get a grip
on reality, Jake.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.405
It wasn't the plug.

11:47.407 --> 11:49.641
I'm cursed.

11:49.643 --> 11:50.875
What are you watchin'?

11:50.877 --> 11:52.077
That TV shrink.

11:52.079 --> 11:55.413
The one who helps viewers
cope with their problems.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.549
Well, is he any good?

11:57.551 --> 11:59.484
He's on channel 129.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.019
You be the judge.

12:02.589 --> 12:05.423
[telephone ringing]

12:05.425 --> 12:07.325
Hello, welcome to "Video Couch."

12:07.327 --> 12:08.626
And you are?

12:08.628 --> 12:10.562
Do I have to give my name?

12:10.564 --> 12:11.930
I don't want
my friends and neighbors

12:11.932 --> 12:13.131
hearing about this.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.967
It would help
if I could call you something.

12:15.969 --> 12:17.836
Okay. Willie Tanner.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.439
How can I help you, Willie?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.074
I'm a visitor in your country

12:23.076 --> 12:25.710
and I did something
that in my homeland

12:25.712 --> 12:27.712
brings a person bad luck.

12:27.714 --> 12:29.314
The only way to shake it off

12:29.316 --> 12:31.483
is for me to do
a certain ritual.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.551
But people think I'm crazy.

12:34.821 --> 12:37.055
Uh, Willie,
immigrants often have trouble

12:37.057 --> 12:38.990
assimilating into a new culture.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.693
If you feel you must
do this ritual, go ahead.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.728
I can't!

12:43.730 --> 12:46.965
Uh, see the things I need
for this are far, far away

12:46.967 --> 12:48.299
in my galaxy.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.602
Uh, my-my part of the galaxy.

12:50.604 --> 12:53.438
Uh, our galaxy, Yonkers.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.475
Perhaps you'd feel better if you
carried a good luck charm.

12:57.477 --> 13:01.880
You mean, like a Tupperware lid
or a mouse?

13:01.882 --> 13:04.282
Well, whatever's appropriate
in your country.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.717
I tried that.

13:05.719 --> 13:08.987
But my bad luck
is only getting worse.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.456
- How's that, Willie?
- It's spreading.

13:11.458 --> 13:12.824
See, people I come
in contact with

13:12.826 --> 13:15.794
are having bad luck
and getting hurt too.

13:15.796 --> 13:17.162
And you think you have the power

13:17.164 --> 13:20.331
to affect other people's lives
this way?

13:20.333 --> 13:22.534
[crashing]

13:25.405 --> 13:27.438
We'll take our next call.

13:29.075 --> 13:32.744
I guess I shouldn't expect
too much from a cable quack.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.215
What did you do to your hand,
Mr. Tanner?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.384
Oh, nothing.

13:39.386 --> 13:40.585
That does it.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.320
It's too dangerous for you guys

13:42.322 --> 13:44.055
to have me around.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.323
You're gonna have to move.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.458
We're not going anywhere.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.160
Wait, ALF,
I was thinkin'.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.230
Why can't we at least
try to do your ritual here?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.765
- How?
- Well, uh..

13:53.767 --> 13:55.667
There is a full moon tonight.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.136
But it has to be a green moon..

13:58.138 --> 13:59.871
...like Melmac's.

13:59.873 --> 14:02.173
But you showed us pictures
of your planet's moon.

14:02.175 --> 14:03.408
It's not green.

14:03.410 --> 14:04.609
Well, it was when certain

14:04.611 --> 14:07.212
atmospheric conditions
were right

14:07.214 --> 14:10.682
or when someone threw up on it.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.116
Um, we could fake it,
you know, uh

14:12.118 --> 14:16.187
have everybody
wear green sunglasses.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.389
Jake, you're a genius!

14:18.391 --> 14:20.925
Plus, you've got
good fashion sense.

14:20.927 --> 14:24.462
Now, I just need five people
to witness the ceremony

14:24.464 --> 14:25.997
and to wear meat.

14:30.070 --> 14:32.303
I'm not wearing meat.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.738
Please?

14:35.976 --> 14:37.609
I have to draw
the line somewhere

14:37.611 --> 14:40.979
and I choose to draw it
at the wearing of meat.

14:40.981 --> 14:45.083
¶ I'll whine till you give in ¶¶

14:46.186 --> 14:48.887
You know, Mr. Tanner,
it might help..

14:50.457 --> 14:51.990
Think about the baby.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.659
You want me
acting like this around it?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.828
Huh, I couldn't live with myself

14:56.830 --> 14:59.797
if anything happened
to little ALF Tanner.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.769
Alright.

15:04.771 --> 15:09.807
Yes! He's going to wear meat!

15:09.809 --> 15:11.876
What kind of meat
are we talking about here?

15:11.878 --> 15:14.545
Uh, pork, veal,
whatever you prefer.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.547
Uh, but no spam.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.552
I'll wear meat.

15:23.823 --> 15:26.124
Why do we have to wear meat
in this ritual, anyway?

15:26.126 --> 15:30.561
Because the high priest
on Melmac was also a butcher.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.632
[instrumental music]

15:38.638 --> 15:41.873
Did all Melmacian rituals
involve wearing meat?

15:41.875 --> 15:44.509
Yeah, unless they
took place on a Friday.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.978
Then we wore fish.

15:46.980 --> 15:49.681
How long
does this ceremony take?

15:49.683 --> 15:51.182
Not long. Why?

15:51.184 --> 15:53.918
These steaks
are getting a little gamy.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.692
No pictures, please.

16:02.495 --> 16:05.029
I feel like an idiot.

16:05.031 --> 16:07.765
Come on, dad.
This is very serious to ALF.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.434
I don't think
we should put him down

16:09.436 --> 16:10.802
just because
we don't understand

16:10.804 --> 16:13.237
the nuances of his culture.

16:13.239 --> 16:17.775
No matter how incredibly stupid
those nuances may seem.

16:17.777 --> 16:20.311
Hey, Lynn, how do I look?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.580
A1.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.382
Brian, hurry up!

16:24.384 --> 16:26.217
We're about to start!

16:26.219 --> 16:30.021
Okay, what is it exactly
you want us to do, ALF?

16:30.023 --> 16:32.123
Basically, just be witnesses

16:32.125 --> 16:36.294
while I apologize
for my misdeed.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.262
And we have to wear this, right?

16:38.264 --> 16:42.266
Because if I find out later
that this wasn't necessary--

16:42.268 --> 16:45.069
- It is! It is!
- Uh-huh.

16:45.071 --> 16:48.573
Okay, now start pouring
this gravy in your hair.

16:48.575 --> 16:49.774
(Lynn)
ALF!

16:49.776 --> 16:51.776
Alright, that part is optional.

16:51.778 --> 16:55.446
I'm just trying
to make this fun, people.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.682
Don't.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.251
Is my hot dog on straight?

17:00.253 --> 17:02.754
You look fine, honey.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.389
It is now time

17:04.391 --> 17:06.858
to begin the bibliocide ritual.

17:06.860 --> 17:09.193
Everyone put on your shades.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.034
Does the moon look green?

17:16.036 --> 17:20.171
Everything looks green.
Get on with it.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.706
Okay.

17:25.278 --> 17:28.713
"There once was a girl
from Nantucket who.."

17:28.715 --> 17:30.748
Oops. Wrong ceremony.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.820
Could you hurry it up?
Some of us are spoiling.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.056
Okay, okay.

17:40.060 --> 17:43.694
Is it just me
or is it dark out here?

17:43.696 --> 17:46.164
Get this over with.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.532
Aye aye.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.234
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanner,
have you seen Jake?'

17:50.236 --> 17:53.304
Oh, great! My bad luck's
changing for the worse!

17:53.306 --> 17:54.872
(Willie)
ALF, hide.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.980
Hi, Mr. Ochmonek.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.118
Am I interrupting anything?

18:08.221 --> 18:09.887
I don't think so. No.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.426
Why are you
wearing sunglasses at night..

18:15.428 --> 18:16.828
...and meat?

18:16.830 --> 18:18.296
Because I want to.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.734
We want to, also.

18:23.736 --> 18:25.069
I don't.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.307
We-we're, heh heh..

18:29.309 --> 18:31.642
- We're having a barbecue.
- Yeah.

18:31.644 --> 18:33.744
And you're cooking
with body heat?

18:33.746 --> 18:36.080
No, just thawing.

18:38.384 --> 18:40.518
Trevor, haven't you ever
wanted to let your hair down

18:40.520 --> 18:42.153
and slap on a flank steak?

18:43.723 --> 18:46.023
I always thought about it.

18:46.025 --> 18:48.126
I mean,
everybody's thought about it.

18:51.364 --> 18:53.498
Well, gosh,
live a little, Trev, hmm.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.334
I'll do that.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.673
Can we please get this

19:02.675 --> 19:05.109
goofy ceremony over with?

19:05.111 --> 19:06.010
Goofy?

19:06.012 --> 19:07.512
The destruction of history

19:07.514 --> 19:09.847
is not to be taken lightly.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.782
Those who cannot
remember the past

19:11.784 --> 19:15.286
are condemned to repeat it,
you know?

19:15.288 --> 19:16.287
I, I'm sorry, ALF.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.623
I didn't mean
to belittle your ritual.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.491
Please...begin.

19:27.901 --> 19:30.635
"You put your right foot in.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.136
Put your right foot out."

19:32.138 --> 19:33.871
¶ You put your right foot in ¶

19:33.873 --> 19:35.606
¶ And you shake it all about ¶

19:35.608 --> 19:36.641
¶ You do the hokeypokey-- ¶¶

19:36.643 --> 19:38.910
Hold it! Hold it!

19:41.981 --> 19:44.248
This is part of the ritual?

19:44.250 --> 19:47.518
No, but I always thought
it should be.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.554
Stick with the main text.

19:49.556 --> 19:52.223
Okay. Okay.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.057
Gee.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.259
[crickets chirping]

19:59.399 --> 20:01.232
Sorry about the book.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.671
That's it?

20:06.673 --> 20:09.774
Uh-huh. Let's eat.

20:09.776 --> 20:13.144
- That's...it?
- Yes.

20:13.146 --> 20:15.846
I mean, it's not like
I killed somebody.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.249
We went through all this

20:18.251 --> 20:20.918
just for,
"Sorry about the book?"

20:20.920 --> 20:23.988
Hey, a ceremony
doesn't have to be long

20:23.990 --> 20:25.556
to be effective.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.391
A Melmacian wedding consists

20:27.393 --> 20:28.426
of a preacher saying

20:28.428 --> 20:31.495
"You're hitched.
Go for it, babe."

20:34.000 --> 20:36.234
Now Trevor's coming back.

20:36.236 --> 20:38.402
Oh! Man!

20:38.404 --> 20:39.237
[gate opens]

20:39.239 --> 20:40.471
I'm sorry to bother you again

20:40.473 --> 20:43.107
but can I just
get a shot of this?

20:43.109 --> 20:44.175
Why?

20:44.177 --> 20:45.676
Raquel went shopping
and she's never

20:45.678 --> 20:47.111
gonna believe this.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.413
Everybody scrunch together, hmm?

20:50.883 --> 20:53.417
'Alright.'

20:53.419 --> 20:55.419
[camera clicks]

20:56.889 --> 20:59.090
I'll get you some wallet size.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.661
He's gone, ALF.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.563
Do you feel
any luckier?

21:05.565 --> 21:09.200
I don't know. Jake, flip a coin.

21:09.202 --> 21:10.234
Okay.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.307
- Aren't you gonna call it?
- No.

21:16.309 --> 21:19.443
It didn't hit me in the eye,
so my luck is back.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.945
Ah! Hey!

21:20.947 --> 21:22.313
¶ You put your right foot in ¶

21:22.315 --> 21:23.948
¶ You put your right foot out ¶

21:23.950 --> 21:25.349
¶ You put your right foot in ¶

21:25.351 --> 21:26.284
Everybody!

21:26.286 --> 21:28.085
¶ And you shake it all about ¶

21:28.087 --> 21:29.654
¶ You do the hokeypokey ¶

21:29.656 --> 21:31.389
¶ And you turn yourself around ¶

21:31.391 --> 21:33.491
¶ That's what it's all about ¶¶

21:33.493 --> 21:36.861
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Where is everybody?

21:36.863 --> 21:39.063
[instrumental music]

21:40.433 --> 21:41.932
[instrumental music]

21:44.370 --> 21:45.436
(Jake)
I call.

21:50.043 --> 21:52.109
- Another royal flush?
- Oh, what?

21:52.111 --> 21:53.911
- 'Man!'
- I'm embarrassed.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.047
I truly am embarrassed.

21:56.049 --> 21:58.215
Hah! I can't believe my luck!

21:58.217 --> 22:01.118
Someone get me a racing form.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.021
- I'm busted.
- That's okay, Brian.

22:04.023 --> 22:08.192
You wouldn't have
liked college, anyway. Hah!

22:08.194 --> 22:11.362
ALF, are you sure you're playing
exactly by the rules?

22:11.364 --> 22:13.731
I'm not cheating. I told you.

22:13.733 --> 22:17.001
Once a person is released
from the bad luck curse

22:17.003 --> 22:19.136
he enjoys a period of good luck.

22:19.138 --> 22:23.007
Sometimes up to three days.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.810
[clanging]

22:25.812 --> 22:28.346
I said<i> up to</i> three days.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.649
[instrumental music]

22:33.019 --> 22:35.219
[theme music]

23:00.747 --> 23:02.747
[ALF laughing]
