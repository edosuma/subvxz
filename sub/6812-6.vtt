00:22.640 --> 00:23.880
MAN: Come on.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.095
CLAUDINE: Come on, bitches.

00:29.190 --> 00:31.738
Get back! Get back!

00:32.030 --> 00:33.145
Don't, please, don't.

00:33.280 --> 00:34.941
Down on the ground
right now.

00:35.990 --> 00:37.116
All of it. Come on.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.610
That's it. That's all.

00:47.040 --> 00:48.246
NATE: Hey, hey, hey.

00:48.340 --> 00:49.955
Hey, hey, wait a second! Aah!

00:52.510 --> 00:53.499
D'AVENIR: Ah...

00:54.590 --> 00:57.468
I am sensing
a presence is now with us.

00:57.970 --> 01:00.302
Can you feel that
we are not alone?

01:00.970 --> 01:04.349
Oh, yeah,
I definitely get the sense
that we are not alone.

01:04.480 --> 01:09.315
I am being told that
you will discover
something from your past.

01:10.150 --> 01:13.142
Is there a John in your life?

01:14.070 --> 01:15.025
No.

01:15.150 --> 01:16.777
Michael?
Nope.

01:17.660 --> 01:18.979
A Steve?
Nope.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.940
William?
No, no, no.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.905
How about if
there's anybody whose name

01:23.000 --> 01:25.992
starts with
the letters "B," "R,"
or "T"?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.452
Ah, lots of people.
Lots of...

01:29.040 --> 01:31.201
The spirits are correct! Yes!

01:31.340 --> 01:32.375
No, but I know
thousands of...

01:32.510 --> 01:33.545
Okay, uh...

01:34.590 --> 01:35.921
What else are
the spirits telling you?

01:36.010 --> 01:38.171
That there will
be a tall, dark

01:38.300 --> 01:40.461
and handsome man coming
into your life soon.

01:41.180 --> 01:42.920
Oh, and young.
Really?

01:43.020 --> 01:44.260
Yes, really.

01:44.350 --> 01:46.432
You said the exact
same thing three weeks ago,
word for word,

01:46.520 --> 01:48.590
and if I didn't know better,
I'd think you were
making it all up.

01:48.690 --> 01:50.601
No, no, no.
The spirits are telling me now

01:50.690 --> 01:52.567
that your
skepticism is because

01:52.690 --> 01:54.351
you're going
through a very bad period

01:54.490 --> 01:56.811
of doubt in your
life right now.

01:56.900 --> 02:00.358
Listen, I am a super cop
with a 100% solve rate
and a perfect memory.

02:00.450 --> 02:01.860
I'm not really that
familiar with doubt.

02:01.990 --> 02:03.230
All your
chattering is interfering

02:03.370 --> 02:04.689
with my connection
to the spirits.

02:04.790 --> 02:07.702
Although, in their defense,
on June 18th,
they told me I'd be facing

02:07.790 --> 02:09.166
an uphill struggle
to overcome something,

02:09.250 --> 02:10.535
and right after that,
I got poisoned.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.791
I predicted a damn poisoning.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.201
And... My...

02:15.340 --> 02:17.001
My dear Carrie,

02:17.090 --> 02:19.672
haven't the spirits proven
themselves to you now?

02:19.890 --> 02:20.879
No.

02:21.640 --> 02:22.709
Yes.

02:23.220 --> 02:24.801
I don't know.
I'm struggling with it,

02:24.890 --> 02:26.721
because on April 25th,
they told me that...

02:28.230 --> 02:29.390
Hey, Al.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.720
Really

02:32.570 --> 02:34.720
Um, okay.
I'm on my way.

02:34.860 --> 02:35.895
All right, bye.

02:35.990 --> 02:37.059
Hmm.

02:37.150 --> 02:39.402
The spirits want to make sure
that they tell you

02:39.490 --> 02:41.902
about the tall,
dark and handsome man

02:41.990 --> 02:44.902
whose name
begins With letter...

02:44.990 --> 02:46.400
The letter "A," I know.

02:46.540 --> 02:48.906
Al, my partner.
They heard me talking
to him on the phone.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.457
No, the spirits are saying
his name begins with

02:51.580 --> 02:54.128
the letter "E," actually.

02:55.210 --> 02:56.871
Really, the letter "E"?
Mmm-hmm.

02:56.960 --> 02:58.416
I will see you next week.

02:59.340 --> 03:00.580
Okay, I'll be here.

03:00.970 --> 03:03.791
No, I'm not asking you.
I know.

03:04.390 --> 03:05.345
Okay.

03:05.430 --> 03:06.590
Okay, thank you.
Okay.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.676
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
Traffic.

03:08.770 --> 03:11.432
Why does my crazy psychic
have to live all
the way out in Queens?

03:11.520 --> 03:13.010
What, your fraud
of a fortune teller

03:13.110 --> 03:14.566
couldn't see
traffic in your future?

03:14.650 --> 03:17.437
No, but she did see
a very handsome
man entering my life.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.600
Ah! Look no further.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.907
She also said young.

03:21.990 --> 03:23.116
Okay.

03:24.030 --> 03:26.407
Masked man entered
Bob's Quickie Mart

03:26.490 --> 03:28.788
at 5:30 this morning,
ran out with 800 bucks.

03:28.910 --> 03:29.956
CARRIE: So who's our victim?

03:30.660 --> 03:32.662
Nate Orton, 49 years old.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.587
According to witnesses,
he arrived

03:34.670 --> 03:36.456
just as the gunman
was leaving the store.

03:36.550 --> 03:39.622
Single gunshot
wound to the chest.
No ballistics.

03:39.720 --> 03:40.960
MAN: Go, go!

03:41.800 --> 03:42.789
Get back!

03:42.890 --> 03:44.710
Count of one,
and somebody's
pulling up a stump.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.631
I said, get back!

03:46.760 --> 03:48.887
Wow! Aggressive.

03:48.970 --> 03:50.096
Assertive.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.556
What are these guys
doing here anyway?

03:51.640 --> 03:53.392
Our victim's not
exactly famous.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.549
AL: Stringers.

03:54.650 --> 03:56.470
We call them _
the "horror papara22i".

03:56.570 --> 04:00.643
Instead of celebrities,
they shoot crime scenes,
victims.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.809
It's gross.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.903
So they sell footage of
other people's misery,
trying to make a couple bucks?

04:04.990 --> 04:06.321
That's pathetic.

04:11.160 --> 04:12.149
He was one of them.

04:17.000 --> 04:20.333
You guys,
look at the microphone
on that camera.

04:20.460 --> 04:22.166
Exactly the same as
this one, right here.

04:22.260 --> 04:25.718
What if Nate Orton
was filming the robbery?

04:25.840 --> 04:29.139
He gets shot,
the camera drops,
microphone breaks off.

04:29.220 --> 04:31.768
But the camera's not here,
which means the killer
must have grabbed it.

04:31.850 --> 04:36.184
But guess what?
The microphones
have memory chips in them.

04:36.270 --> 04:39.103
Listen, Delina,
can you get this to Jay,
have him work his magic on it?

04:39.190 --> 04:40.179
All right, I got it.

04:41.570 --> 04:42.810
Those the witnesses?

04:42.900 --> 04:45.653
AL: On their way home
from a prep school prom.

04:45.740 --> 04:48.152
All of them were
inside the store
when Orton was shot,

04:48.240 --> 04:50.572
and so far, none of them
remember anything.

04:50.700 --> 04:51.746
Really?

04:53.580 --> 04:55.286
Hell of a way to
end prom night.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.675
DENNY: Okay,
so he hides his face.

05:11.930 --> 05:13.420
_No mistakes.
Didn't leave any
prints at the scene.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.801
Pretty good for a punk robber.

05:15.890 --> 05:17.721
What about exterior cameras?
Out of commi55ion.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.396
CSU find the vic's camera yet?
Nope.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.107
Carrie was right.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.146
Move.
Right.

05:24.650 --> 05:27.699
SD card in the mic
wand was intact.
AL: Which means?

05:27.780 --> 05:30.078
Which means maybe
we can hear everything
that went down.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.627
Okay, so I pulled out
all the ambient noise I could.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.079
Check this.

05:46.760 --> 05:48.296
NATE: Butterfly.

05:48.430 --> 05:49.419
Go back.

05:52.970 --> 05:55.632
NATE:
Ohh... Butterfly.

05:55.770 --> 05:57.089
Butterfly?

05:57.310 --> 05:59.050
What's that mean?

05:59.150 --> 06:01.436
He'd just been shot.
Probably was in shock.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.476
Unless he thought
those were his last words.

06:03.610 --> 06:05.896
Or maybe it's like
a "Rosebud" kind of thing,
like in Citizen Kane.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.026
You know, it turned out
that was his sled
when he was a kid.

06:08.660 --> 06:09.945
_ How about _
a sp0iler alert next time?

06:10.030 --> 06:12.692
The movie came out in 1941.
You don't get a spoiler alert.

06:27.760 --> 06:28.795
There was a butterfly.

06:29.220 --> 06:32.849
One of the prom girls
had a butterfly
tattoo on her ankle.

06:33.390 --> 06:34.960
What if she was
near Nate when he died?

06:35.060 --> 06:38.132
All seven _kids said
they were in5ide the store.

06:38.390 --> 06:40.642
So she's lying.
Yep.

06:41.940 --> 06:42.975
Call my daughter
a liar again...

06:43.110 --> 06:44.600
We're not calling
your daughter a liar.

06:44.690 --> 06:46.271
I'm gonna sue all
your asses, okay?

06:48.530 --> 06:50.737
than being sued by
someone like you,
so please just sit down.

06:50.820 --> 06:53.072
Okay, everybody here needs
to stop talking
about asses, okay?

06:53.160 --> 06:55.981
MR. FUGARD: Look,
my daughter already told you
that she was inside the store.

06:56.080 --> 06:58.241
She didn't see anything
that happened outside.

06:58.330 --> 07:01.163
Uma, I understand that
you saw a man get shot,

07:01.250 --> 07:05.698
and I understand how
terrifying that is.
Believe me, I do.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.580
But this is so important.

07:07.670 --> 07:09.331
You don't have to
say anything, okay?

07:09.470 --> 07:10.835
CARRIE: He knew
you were there.

07:10.970 --> 07:12.961
"Butterfly" was
the last word he said.

07:13.050 --> 07:15.883
You have a butterfly
tattoo on your ankle.

07:16.430 --> 07:20.935
I think he thought
that whatever you saw
could help us solve this.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.305
She already told
you everything.

07:22.400 --> 07:23.469
Dad.

07:24.110 --> 07:25.429
It's okay.

07:27.650 --> 07:30.483
I was in Spencer's
Caddy when everyone
went into the store,

07:30.570 --> 07:32.310
'cause I was tired.

07:33.410 --> 07:37.369
But then I got bored,
so I opened
the door to get out.

07:37.870 --> 07:39.997
Then suddenly
this van came up,

07:40.080 --> 07:41.786
and a guy with a camera,

07:42.620 --> 07:45.453
he got out and ran
towards the store.

07:46.960 --> 07:49.042
That's when the man
with the gun came out.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.428
I crouched down to hide.

07:52.340 --> 07:55.218
The car was between
me and the two of them.

07:56.350 --> 07:59.888
I heard the shot,
and then the camera guy fell.

08:00.890 --> 08:02.767
Okay, we're done now.
We're done.

08:02.900 --> 08:05.801
I know she's scared.
I know you're scared for her.

08:05.900 --> 08:07.811
But you can help
me catch this guy.

08:08.110 --> 08:10.852
The sooner you help me,
the sooner he's
off the streets,

08:10.940 --> 08:12.817
and you don't have to be
frightened any more.

08:13.450 --> 08:15.406
I never saw his face.

08:15.530 --> 08:17.441
He was wearing a mask.
I...

08:17.580 --> 08:20.572
I was still ducked down,
he ran past me,
jumped into a car.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.406
Okay, that's good.
What kind of car?

08:22.500 --> 08:24.286
I don't know.
I can't remember.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.489
CARRIE: It's okay.

08:25.580 --> 08:28.299
Anything that you
saw can help us.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.085
Anything at all.

08:31.010 --> 08:32.079
I...

08:33.470 --> 08:35.210
I saw he had cuffs.

08:35.590 --> 08:37.967
The shooter?
On his pant legs.

08:38.390 --> 08:40.802
I remember thinking
that no one wears cuffs.

08:40.930 --> 08:42.227
CARRIE: Let's go back
to the car, okay?

08:42.310 --> 08:45.802
Is there anything you remember
about the car, the color?

08:45.940 --> 08:47.009
Yeah.

08:47.560 --> 08:48.640
It was gray.

08:48.770 --> 08:50.931
Anything else about the car
that you can remember?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.679
Any specifics, make?

08:53.360 --> 08:54.850
Take a breath.

08:55.570 --> 08:56.650
Relax

08:57.570 --> 08:58.946
and focus.

08:59.830 --> 09:00.899
I...

09:02.790 --> 09:04.610
...remember part of
the license plate.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.450
That's great.

09:19.810 --> 09:21.004
Thanks, Jay.

09:21.140 --> 09:24.553
RFK 575 belongs to
a gray Nissan Maxima,

09:24.640 --> 09:27.017
which, according to LoJack,

09:27.150 --> 09:30.017
went directly
from Bob's Quickie Mart
to right here.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.331
Cuffs on his pants,
just like Uma said.

09:55.550 --> 09:57.006
Looks like we got
our shooter.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.762
Gunman's name was Bud Mayer.

10:04.850 --> 10:07.933
Crazy thing is,
this is not some kid
looking for quick cash.

10:08.020 --> 10:09.726
This was_
a profe55ional hitman,

10:09.860 --> 10:11.680
hired contract killer
out of Sarasota.

10:11.980 --> 10:13.527
Ex-serviceman. Coast Guard.

10:13.650 --> 10:14.935
What's a professional
hitman doing

10:15.030 --> 10:16.520
knocking over
a convenience store?

10:16.650 --> 10:18.732
See, I don't think he was.

10:19.410 --> 10:20.946
Hitmen kill people, right?

10:21.030 --> 10:24.033
So what if the
convenience store robbery
was just his cover,

10:24.120 --> 10:27.078
and he was specifically
there to kill Nate?

10:27.210 --> 10:28.746
So Nate's murder
was the reason

10:28.870 --> 10:30.531
for the robbery
and not vice versa.

10:30.670 --> 10:33.377
Nate Orton was exactly
where he was supposed to be,

10:33.460 --> 10:34.836
where someone
wanted him to be.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.411
He was lured there.
That's why he got to
the robbery so fast.

10:37.550 --> 10:39.290
So we're thinking
Mayer kills Nate Orton,

10:39.380 --> 10:41.041
then goes to meet
whoever's gonna pay him,

10:41.180 --> 10:43.842
except he doesn't
get paid, right?
He gets smoked.

10:43.930 --> 10:47.514
So if Bud Mayer was
hired to kill Nate Orton,
why do it this crazy way?

10:47.600 --> 10:51.388
'Cause_ it's smart.
Convenience store,
wrong place, wrong time.

10:51.480 --> 10:53.311
Nobody checks into
the victim's past.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.436
Nobody tries to figure out
who wanted him dead.

10:55.570 --> 10:58.858
Nate Orton was a stringer
for local news stations.
Why him?

10:58.950 --> 11:00.941
Wasn't always a stringer.

11:01.990 --> 11:03.821
Ten years ago,
he was a war photographer.

11:03.910 --> 11:06.401
Spent years in
the Middle East,
Darfur and the Congo.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.401
Got an ex-wife out
in Arizona, no kids.
Parents dead.

11:09.540 --> 11:10.780
And where does this guy live?

11:10.920 --> 11:12.239
Uh...

11:12.330 --> 11:13.706
Apartment in Ozone Park.

11:13.790 --> 11:16.122
Get your partner.
Go check out this guy's place.

11:20.590 --> 11:22.751
You getting texts
from your fortune teller now?

11:22.890 --> 11:25.381
Uh, no, from Jay.
Smart-ass.

11:34.060 --> 11:36.142
AL: What can you tell
us about Nate Orton?

11:36.270 --> 11:38.647
He was quiet.
Paid his rent on time.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.196
Friends, girlfriend?

11:40.280 --> 11:43.272
None of my business.
I'll be downstairs,
you need me.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.865
Place isn't ransacked.

11:49.960 --> 11:53.953
There's no personal pictures,
photographs of
friends or family.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.120
Seems like a lonely guy.

11:56.380 --> 11:58.257
Wow! I know this shot.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.079
It's pretty famous.

12:00.170 --> 12:02.297
Nate must have been
the real deal,
back in the day.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.131
Police, freeze.

12:13.810 --> 12:16.472
Turn around and get down
on the ground. Now!

12:16.980 --> 12:18.811
Not unless you get
down there with me.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.309
Eddie?

12:23.610 --> 12:25.316
You gotta be kidding me.
Seriously?

12:25.620 --> 12:26.689
How you folks doing?

12:26.830 --> 12:28.149
You got three
seconds to tell me

12:28.240 --> 12:29.537
what you're doing here,
or I will shoot you.

12:29.660 --> 12:31.150
Any way to talk
to your ex

12:31.290 --> 12:32.496
Two seconds.

12:32.580 --> 12:33.820
Hey, okay. Okay.

12:35.670 --> 12:37.331
_ I saw on
the Wire you came across

12:37.420 --> 12:40.048
some handiwork from
an old acquaintance
of mine, Bud Mayer.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.546
You have a lot
of acquaintances

12:41.670 --> 12:43.001
that seem to end up
in New York.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.088
No. But I've been tailing him
for two years now,

12:46.180 --> 12:49.217
ever since he was
hired to take down
a young prosecutor in Daytona.

12:49.350 --> 12:51.727
You're always
tailing someone,
you know that?

12:51.850 --> 12:53.431
Bud missed the DA.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.182
But he killed
the man's 24-year-old fiancee.

12:56.310 --> 12:59.222
Figure if he's plying
his trade in New York,
I'd see what turns up.

12:59.360 --> 13:01.021
And what turns up
is Bud Mayer's body.

13:01.150 --> 13:03.141
Which you must have known
before you came up here.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.855
Easy, compadre.

13:04.990 --> 13:08.323
I got Mayer linked to
five other unsolved murders
in Florida alone,

13:08.410 --> 13:11.072
so naturally I
thought there might be
something relevant up here.

13:12.040 --> 13:14.076
And I mean, who knows?

13:14.210 --> 13:15.859
Right, Carrie?
Yeah, who knows?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.036
Okay, slick.
But we ask the questions.

13:18.130 --> 13:19.950
Keep your mitts off
our investigation,
all right?

13:20.050 --> 13:21.039
Yeah, no problem.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.218
As far as I'm concerned,
you can put your
mitts wherever you want.

13:23.340 --> 13:24.659
AL: For now,
you're excused, Eddie.

13:26.640 --> 13:27.709
Oh, don't be an asshole.

13:29.260 --> 13:32.263
Your victim,
he's a photographer,
a video guy.

13:32.560 --> 13:33.800
Where's his equipment?

13:33.890 --> 13:35.437
No cameras, no computers.

13:42.400 --> 13:43.731
I know where it is.

13:44.690 --> 13:48.319
You're up here so often,
Eddie, maybe you should think
about getting a place.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.696
Actually, I have a suite
at this hotel on Bleecker.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.611
Every room has
a massage chair.

13:52.740 --> 13:54.492
Maybe you should
come over and loosen up.

13:54.580 --> 13:57.037
Sorry, I'm all booked.
Ah, you meant her.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.917
No, I'm good.
I'm very familiar with

13:59.000 --> 14:00.911
the Eddie Ma_rtin
massage experience.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.416
Ah, what's that
supposed to mean?
I have never had

14:02.550 --> 14:03.665
an unhappy customer.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.297
Uh, I was an unhappy customer
when you used that
massage candle on me,

14:06.420 --> 14:08.217
gave me
third-degree burns...
You knocked it out of my hand.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.097
Then you ruined
my sheets with it,
and then on top of that,

14:10.220 --> 14:12.176
you massaged my neck so hard
that you actually
slipped my disc.

14:12.260 --> 14:15.388
Look, I am deeply committed
to my deep-tissue techniques,
by the way.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.720
These hands are magic.

14:16.810 --> 14:19.722
So magic that I couldn't turn
my head to the left or
the right for about,

14:19.810 --> 14:21.266
oh, I don't know, eight weeks?

14:32.950 --> 14:35.783
There used to be four
hard drives right there,
and now they're gone.

14:35.910 --> 14:38.617
What if they got stolen,
and what if
whatever was on them

14:38.710 --> 14:39.859
is what got Nate Orton killed?

14:42.460 --> 14:46.453
Invoices from WETX News.
Must have sold
footage to them.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.927
All right.
Let's get Denny on it.

14:49.010 --> 14:50.079
I can do it.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.465
No, we can handle it, Eddie.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.309
How about we just
let you know what we find?

14:54.760 --> 14:55.806
EDDIE: Okay.

14:56.220 --> 14:58.939
You know, there's
a great bar at the hotel.

14:59.020 --> 15:01.306
If you're free later,
wanna update me...

15:01.400 --> 15:02.936
No, I really can't.
EDDIE: Okay.

15:03.020 --> 15:04.976
Maybe later. Yeah, no.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.142
Okay, maybe. I'll...
Let me think about it.

15:09.320 --> 15:10.947
Don't look at me.

15:12.030 --> 15:13.019
Ah...

15:13.160 --> 15:16.152
Okay, so we talked
to the WETX News director.
All right?

15:16.290 --> 15:18.326
A, she's sending over
all the footage
Nate ever sold her.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.449
Good. What's B?

15:20.250 --> 15:22.036
Uh?
You said, A.
There's gotta be a B.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.286
I didn't know
that was a rule.

15:25.130 --> 15:27.337
There is a B.
Right before he was killed,

15:27.420 --> 15:30.173
Nate got a phone call about
the Quickie Mart robbery.
That's when he took off.

15:30.630 --> 15:32.757
Who called him?
It was a burner cell,
we can't trace it.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.172
And here's the thing.
We think it was
his own burner.

15:35.890 --> 15:37.050
What the hell are
you talking about?

15:37.180 --> 15:38.977
According to
the lady from WETX,

15:39.060 --> 15:41.346
Nate handed out burner cells
to all kinds of people.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.801
Homeless dudes,
anybody who hung
out on the streets.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.390
And he told them
to give him a call

15:45.520 --> 15:46.930
as soon as they saw
something go down.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.646
Paid them 50 bucks
if the tip turned
into a sellable video.

15:49.740 --> 15:50.775
Smart.

15:50.860 --> 15:52.270
Might also be
what got him killed.

15:52.360 --> 15:54.942
Now, news director also said
he was one of her best guys.

15:55.030 --> 15:57.942
Always worked hard,
handed in great footage.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.996
Suffered some
emotional issues from

16:00.080 --> 16:01.866
the stuff he saw while
filming in war zones.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.370
Things he must have seen.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.240
News director tell
you about anything Orton

16:05.380 --> 16:07.041
filmed that may
have put him in danger?

16:07.130 --> 16:08.370
Yeah, about a month ago.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.337
He called her saying
he caught the aftermath

16:10.420 --> 16:12.297
of a drive-by
involving Orlando Martinez.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.719
As in, Orlando Martinez,
enforcer for
the Delgado drug cartel?

16:17.100 --> 16:18.465
Not a guy I'd wanna piss off.

16:18.560 --> 16:20.266
Maybe he knew that.

16:20.390 --> 16:21.379
He never handed
in the footage.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.592
If Orton filmed Martinez
or any of his people
in a drive-by,

16:24.730 --> 16:26.937
they'd want to make sure
that footage never got out.

16:27.900 --> 16:29.356
_ Ed_die _is here
investigating a case.

16:29.440 --> 16:30.896
What is so suspicious
about that?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.855
He's pursuing a dead hitman.
That's what's so suspicious.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.770
Okay, listen,
Al, Eddie and I
got divorced.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.195
Newly divorced.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.328
For all I know,
you got married
again last weekend.

16:38.410 --> 16:39.729
Last weekend? No.

16:39.830 --> 16:42.708
The case is a cover because
he's not done With you,
and you know it.

16:42.790 --> 16:44.496
You know,
you're jealous
and protective,

16:44.580 --> 16:46.457
and I want to tell
you that is very sexy.

16:49.460 --> 16:50.836
That's him.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.189
I found something.

17:25.790 --> 17:26.779
Oh.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.336
You sure did.

17:35.630 --> 17:39.214
Look, that guy was
a fly buzzing around.

17:39.800 --> 17:44.009
I don't swat files.
I go after the big insects,
scorpions.

17:44.140 --> 17:45.880
Here's what I think.

17:46.310 --> 17:48.392
Nate Orton filmed
you doing something

17:48.480 --> 17:51.108
that would send you to prison
for a long time.

17:51.190 --> 17:54.933
But you didn't
want to go to prison
for a long time,

17:55.030 --> 17:56.270
so you killed him.

17:56.360 --> 17:57.987
I'm in the background
of some video.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.941
You_can't see
me d0ing nothing.

18:00.030 --> 18:01.611
I should sue for,
What's it called,

18:01.700 --> 18:03.076
misappropriation of likeness.

18:03.160 --> 18:06.118
You should. Wow.
You're a real F. Lee Bailey.

18:06.500 --> 18:08.161
I know my rights.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.496
I didn't have to
steal that footage.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.332
That guy, Orton,
he didn't even
have it no more.

18:13.670 --> 18:14.830
How would you know that?

18:14.920 --> 18:16.626
I got a call from
another video guy,

18:16.720 --> 18:18.676
says he's got the footage.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.341
Wanted to sell it.

18:20.430 --> 18:22.386
So why would I kill your guy?

18:22.850 --> 18:24.340
Who's this other guy?

18:24.430 --> 18:26.341
I don't know. I killed him.

18:30.060 --> 18:31.357
Messing with you.

18:31.440 --> 18:33.067
You're a real funny guy,
Orlando.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.270
Maybe we should
keep you in here

18:35.360 --> 18:37.191
a little longer While
we follow up on that.

18:38.700 --> 18:40.190
I didn't get the guy's name.

18:40.280 --> 18:43.408
But he was real slimy,
you know, skinny, real angry.

18:43.660 --> 18:45.321
He had a sorry-ass mustache.

18:46.750 --> 18:47.739
It's gross.

18:48.540 --> 18:50.917
AL: Stringers. At the car
accidents, drive-bys...

18:53.380 --> 18:54.836
Andy Wilson.

18:55.590 --> 18:57.296
He was at the crime scene.

19:01.550 --> 19:03.711
EDDIE: Hey, Al,
news station says Wilson

19:03.810 --> 19:05.846
just called from
inside the strip club fire.

19:05.930 --> 19:07.591
All right, thanks.

19:08.060 --> 19:09.436
Wilson should be
around here someplace.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.221
He was just on
the phone with WETX,

19:11.310 --> 19:14.063
trying to sell
them his unique angle
on a strip club fire.

19:14.150 --> 19:16.562
I don't see him,
but look who I do see.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.026
Hey, Eddie!

19:21.320 --> 19:23.652
Taking in
a little entertainment
While you're in town?

19:23.740 --> 19:25.367
_You never could
re5ist a good strip club.

19:25.540 --> 19:27.280
Hmm. Guilty as charged.

19:27.410 --> 19:29.651
Apparently,
that last call to Nate

19:29.750 --> 19:32.412
from the burner came
in at exactly 5:21 am,

19:32.500 --> 19:33.580
which is odd because...

19:33.710 --> 19:36.588
Because the time stamp
on the store's
security footage

19:36.670 --> 19:39.628
had our hitman entering
the store at 5:25 am.

19:39.760 --> 19:41.671
I love it
when we finish
each other's thoughts.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.923
Point is, Nate gets
a tip about a robbery
before it's even started.

19:45.050 --> 19:47.848
That's how he was lured there.
Before the cops,
before other stringers.

19:47.930 --> 19:51.718
Which means
Whoever wanted him dead
knew his schedule.

19:51.810 --> 19:54.222
That's Why they picked
that Quickie Mart, right?

19:54.310 --> 19:57.143
Because they kneW
he'd be right down
the street at WETX.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.599
See? She finishes
my thoughts, too.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.391
Keep an eye out for Wilson.
I'm gonna check
inside the club.

20:01.490 --> 20:02.605
Sure.

20:03.280 --> 20:04.269
What?

20:04.410 --> 20:05.616
You're remarkable.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.867
And distracting.

20:07.950 --> 20:09.781
Well, so are you.

20:10.290 --> 20:12.451
But I'm still
able to do my job.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.621
Meaning?
Meaning there goes
Andy Wilson.

20:50.660 --> 20:51.945
Nice right hook.

20:52.040 --> 20:54.201
Maybe there is still
magic in those hands, uh?

20:54.580 --> 20:56.207
You're welcome.

20:56.330 --> 20:58.491
Guess I can do
my job, after all, uh?

20:58.590 --> 21:02.629
If you're done patting
yourself on the back,
I'm gonna go find his van.

21:05.760 --> 21:07.000
Come on.

21:16.690 --> 21:17.679
Gotcha.

21:20.150 --> 21:21.526
Okay! Okay.

21:22.070 --> 21:25.198
I broke into Nate's van,
but I didn't kill him.

21:25.700 --> 21:26.689
Why'd you run?

21:26.780 --> 21:29.157
I thought your buddies
were coming to talk to me

21:29.240 --> 21:32.949
about an alleged
incident of me messing

21:33.040 --> 21:35.531
with traffic lights
to cause accidents.

21:35.620 --> 21:38.077
Talk to me about the drives
you took from Nate Orton.

21:38.540 --> 21:41.668
Martinez offered me cash,

21:41.750 --> 21:43.718
uh, a lot of cash,

21:43.800 --> 21:47.258
ifI could get
back the footage
of his guys at the drive-by.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.676
Nate refused to
sell it to him.

21:50.300 --> 21:52.598
I wasn't gonna do it.

21:52.720 --> 21:55.518
But when I got to
the Quickie Mart,
Nate was already dead.

21:55.600 --> 21:59.764
So you snuck into his van
at a crime scene,

21:59.900 --> 22:00.935
and just took them?

22:01.070 --> 22:02.970
Well, he didn't need
them anymore!

22:03.070 --> 22:05.140
They just were
sitting right there.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.889
All right.
Look, I'm a scumbag.

22:07.030 --> 22:08.520
I'm not a murderer.

22:08.610 --> 22:10.908
Plus, I was with
my girlfriend

22:10.990 --> 22:12.730
all night,
watching movies at her place.

22:12.830 --> 22:14.400
No disrespect,
I find that hard to believe.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.616
We watched
The Search for Spock
on Netflix.

22:16.750 --> 22:17.910
I swear.
You can check it out.

22:18.250 --> 22:21.538
No, What I find
hard to believe is that
you have a girlfriend.

22:29.180 --> 22:30.636
EDDIE: Hey.
Hey.

22:30.760 --> 22:33.092
So your boy Andy Wilson's
alibi checks out.

22:33.220 --> 22:37.008
The girlfriend
confirms they were watching
Star Trek: Search for Spock,

22:37.100 --> 22:38.260
and The Final Frontier.

22:38.350 --> 22:39.726
The Final Frontier?

22:39.810 --> 22:40.936
We should lock them up
just for that?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.140
You got anything?

22:42.270 --> 22:44.818
Yeah, a headache
from watching
Nate's footage all night.

22:44.940 --> 22:47.943
Car crashes, fires,
bodies gunned
down on a sidewalk.

22:48.030 --> 22:50.737
But it might've
paid off, boss.

22:51.700 --> 22:54.658
These are from a fundraiser
from an inner-City
literacy program.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.497
Nate filled in
for a photographer
a couple weeks ago.

22:57.620 --> 22:58.996
But check this video.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.781
This was in Nate's camera,
and the footage

23:00.880 --> 23:02.700
was shot directly
after the fundraiser.

23:02.790 --> 23:04.997
Now, apparently Nate
saw some car accident

23:05.130 --> 23:07.257
when he was driving
home and filmed it.

23:07.340 --> 23:09.080
Spoke to
Nassau County detectives.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.829
Victim's name was
Laura Parks.

23:10.970 --> 23:12.847
She was on her way home
from the fundraiser,

23:12.970 --> 23:14.130
lost control of her car.

23:14.220 --> 23:16.427
News director said _
Nate was onto something big,

23:16.520 --> 23:17.976
but hadn't shown
her any video yet.

23:18.100 --> 23:20.011
Can't be this.
It's old news already.

23:20.140 --> 23:22.222
Unless it isn't.
There's more, guys.

23:22.310 --> 23:23.937
Take a look

23:24.020 --> 23:25.260
at that.

23:27.740 --> 23:28.775
Wow!

23:29.240 --> 23:30.650
Let's go to the replay, folks.

23:30.780 --> 23:32.316
Mmm-hmm.

23:38.370 --> 23:39.496
Who the hell's that?

23:39.580 --> 23:41.411
He must have been in the car
when it went over the edge.

23:41.500 --> 23:42.535
Check the time stamp.

23:42.670 --> 23:45.161
It's at least
three minutes after the car
goes in the water,

23:45.420 --> 23:48.378
and there's no sign
that he breaks
the surface before that.

23:48.510 --> 23:49.795
Guy has some
serious lung capacity.

23:49.880 --> 23:51.370
Can you get closer?
JAY: No.

23:51.510 --> 23:53.671
There's not enough light.
No way to ID him.

23:53.970 --> 23:56.256
Well,
Nate Orton was trying to.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.347
That's What got him killed.

24:01.770 --> 24:03.180
Our drowning victim,
Laura Parks,

24:03.310 --> 24:04.857
Managing
Director of Free City,

24:04.980 --> 24:07.642
a charity that builds
parks and playgrounds
in low-income neighborhoods.

24:07.730 --> 24:09.357
You talk to Witnesses
who were at the fundraiser?

24:09.490 --> 24:10.559
EDDIE: We're still
checking on guests.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.600
Valet says she
came and left alone.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.907
Autopsy reports
a 0.09 blood alcohol level.

24:15.030 --> 24:16.691
Just above
the legal limit.

24:16.830 --> 24:18.616
And the cause of death
is definitely drowning?

24:18.700 --> 24:19.780
Looks like it.

24:19.870 --> 24:21.997
Delina's going over
the autopsy reports
with Carrie right now,

24:22.080 --> 24:23.456
just to see if
there's anything funky.

24:23.540 --> 24:24.700
What are we looking at?

24:25.040 --> 24:26.871
Nate's photos.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.588
I've been tracking Laura
through the entire fundraiser.

24:29.710 --> 24:31.120
There she goes
eating hors d'oeuvres,

24:31.550 --> 24:33.290
bidding on a trip to Barbados,

24:33.380 --> 24:34.961
knocking down
a second cocktail.

24:35.050 --> 24:37.462
There's nobody
arguing with her,
nobody hitting on her,

24:37.560 --> 24:39.881
anything that's gonna
let us see Who could have
been in that car?

24:39.970 --> 24:40.925
Nope.

24:41.060 --> 24:43.972
Well, Whoever was in that
car sure as hell doesn't
want anyone to know.

24:44.060 --> 24:45.607
He managed to get
himself out of there

24:45.730 --> 24:47.436
and still hasn't come forward.

24:47.570 --> 24:49.106
You got an address
on Laura Parks?

24:49.230 --> 24:51.812
Yeah.
She lived with her sister
out in New Rochelle.

24:53.110 --> 24:55.101
CARRIE: Wow, that fundraiser
looked kind of boring.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.822
Yeah,
well, check this one out,
the one I told you about.

24:57.910 --> 25:00.196
The guy held his
breath for three minutes.
CARRIE: Wow!

25:00.290 --> 25:01.245
Yeah.

25:01.370 --> 25:02.359
DELINA: Hey, Carrie. Hi.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.575
CARRIE: Hey.

25:03.660 --> 25:04.866
Oh, um, this is Eddie.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.496
Eddie's going to be
helping us out
with this case.

25:06.580 --> 25:08.878
Hi.
Eddie! It's nice to meet you.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.081
As in "Eddie" Eddie?

25:11.420 --> 25:13.081
Yeah, as in "Eddie" Eddie.

25:13.170 --> 25:14.671
Wait, does everyone know?

25:14.760 --> 25:18.139
What, that we were
married for 30 seconds?
Yeah, pretty much.

25:18.260 --> 25:20.251
So where are we
on Laura Parks?

25:20.390 --> 25:23.427
Yeah, so the work was done
by an ME out of Great Neck,

25:23.520 --> 25:25.727
but the report seems
pretty straightforward.

25:25.810 --> 25:28.358
"Laura drowned, hit her head
on the side Window of her car

25:28.440 --> 25:29.850
"upon impact with the water,

25:29.940 --> 25:32.602
"such impact being consistent
with a loss of consciousness

25:32.740 --> 25:35.277
"Which rendered her unable
to get out of the vehicle.

25:35.400 --> 25:36.981
"There were no other
wounds to the body."

25:37.110 --> 25:38.987
Really

25:39.120 --> 25:42.328
Pretty much.
Except for one detail
which may be relevant,

25:44.960 --> 25:46.916
Laura's seatbelt
was still fastened.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.376
So it seems
Whoever was in the car

25:48.460 --> 25:50.121
made no attempt to
help her get out.

25:50.210 --> 25:51.666
Really?
Hmm.

25:52.210 --> 25:53.450
CARRIE: Okay, thanks, Delina.

25:53.590 --> 25:54.750
Yeah.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.001
Russo needs these
findings anyway,
so I gotta jump.

25:57.130 --> 25:59.098
Okay.
It was nice to
meet you, Eddie.

25:59.180 --> 26:00.545
Nice to meet you, too.
See you later.

26:03.890 --> 26:05.846
Put your tongue
back in your mouth.
Wow.

26:06.140 --> 26:08.222
You know I only
have eyes for you.
You're so full of shit.

26:08.310 --> 26:09.436
What are you...

26:10.310 --> 26:12.266
What's wrong with
appreciating a little beauty?

26:12.360 --> 26:14.396
You appreciated the beauty
of half the women in Florida,

26:14.490 --> 26:15.980
which is why we're
not married any more.

26:16.070 --> 26:19.654
No, we're not married
anymore because you left.

26:20.700 --> 26:22.236
I'm right here.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.190
Yeah, you are.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.838
I'm getting Carrie,
and we're heading over
to the sister's apartment.

26:37.470 --> 26:39.677
Eddie! You're still here.

26:40.510 --> 26:43.172
Your hitman's dead,
I figured you'd be
heading down to Daytona.

26:43.260 --> 26:45.728
Yeah, Eddie,
you should probably

26:46.180 --> 26:47.477
head back to Daytona.

26:48.060 --> 26:49.436
To... You want me to go?

26:52.480 --> 26:54.687
The hitman is dead.
Dead, yeah.

26:54.820 --> 26:56.606
All right, then.

26:56.690 --> 26:58.646
Keep me updated?
Sure!

26:59.410 --> 27:00.900
All right. Till next time.
Can't wait.

27:04.870 --> 27:06.189
Hey.

27:07.080 --> 27:08.149
I miss something?

27:09.710 --> 27:10.699
No!

27:12.380 --> 27:15.372
I'm heading out to
Laura Parks' apartment.
Figured you'd wanna come.

27:16.130 --> 27:18.462
I don't understand.
You want to see Laura's room

27:18.550 --> 27:20.711
because you think
she was murdered?

27:20.840 --> 27:23.047
The other police
said it was an accident.

27:23.180 --> 27:24.841
Well,
we have reason to believe

27:24.930 --> 27:26.466
there was another
person in the car

27:26.560 --> 27:28.972
with your sister when
it went off the bridge.

27:29.060 --> 27:31.187
What are you talking about?

27:31.520 --> 27:32.555
Who was it?

27:32.650 --> 27:34.561
Ms. Parks,
I have to ask, do you know

27:34.650 --> 27:36.527
_ if Laura was
involved With anyone?

27:36.780 --> 27:39.271
SUSANNA: Not that she told me,
but she didn't
tell me everything.

27:40.530 --> 27:41.986
I don't
understand any of this.

27:42.070 --> 27:43.810
I'm sorry.
I know this is hard.

27:45.240 --> 27:48.789
You mentioned the local police
_ returned a box of
things to you from her car?

27:50.250 --> 27:53.242
After they ruled
it an accident,
they gave it to me.

28:03.260 --> 28:04.420
I haven't been
able to open it.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.051
Do you mind
if we take a look?

28:08.430 --> 28:09.761
Excuse me.

28:16.110 --> 28:17.600
Wait a second.

28:24.490 --> 28:26.276
Table nine.
So?

28:26.370 --> 28:28.326
So Laura sat at table 17.

28:32.580 --> 28:34.491
Okay, boss,
so these are the guests

28:34.630 --> 28:36.279
who were seated at
table number nine.

28:36.420 --> 28:40.379
All right, well, two of
these are senior partners at
the largest firm in the city.

28:40.460 --> 28:42.587
That guy is on
the board of the Met,

28:42.720 --> 28:44.790
and three others are
on the City Council.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.289
Right, so...

28:46.390 --> 28:50.099
So, before you accuse
somebody of, at worst,
drowning a girl,

28:50.180 --> 28:52.637
and at best,
swimming away
and letting her die,

28:52.730 --> 28:54.516
I'd beef up my
theory just a little bit.

28:54.650 --> 28:55.765
You can be sure we will.

28:55.860 --> 28:58.317
So, have you connected
any of them to Laura?

28:58.400 --> 28:59.890
Check this.

29:01.280 --> 29:03.316
That's Thomas Noonan.
The one and only.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.658
New York's favorite
real estate developer
and rising political star.

29:07.410 --> 29:09.787
Okay, you have to be
very sure about this one.

29:09.870 --> 29:11.189
We're sure Tom Noonan
is the pre5ident

29:11.330 --> 29:12.900
of the Board of
Trustees of Free City,

29:13.000 --> 29:14.456
the charity
Laura Parks managed.

29:14.540 --> 29:16.496
And on top of that,
his Wife was out of town

29:16.630 --> 29:18.200
that weekend at
a conference in Zurich.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.706
Yeah, but was he in that car?

29:20.840 --> 29:23.047
That's What Al and Carrie
are gonna find out.

29:26.090 --> 29:27.170
CHRIS: Tom.

29:29.180 --> 29:30.215
Tom Noonan.
Hey.

29:30.470 --> 29:32.176
_ Carrie Wells.
Lieutenant Burns.

29:32.310 --> 29:33.516
Thank you for your service.

29:33.600 --> 29:36.012
Chris explained to
me Why you're here.

29:36.100 --> 29:39.228
I was shocked to hear
about Laura's death.

29:39.770 --> 29:40.930
She was a wonderful woman.

29:41.030 --> 29:43.430
She managed one
of my charities
and did a great job.

29:43.530 --> 29:45.350
We're actually
also investigating

29:45.450 --> 29:48.362
the murder of a journalist,
Nate Orton.
Does that ring a bell?

29:48.490 --> 29:49.570
No. I'm sorry.

29:49.700 --> 29:51.691
It's interesting
you and Laura were

29:51.790 --> 29:53.439
at the same
fundraiser the
night she died,

29:53.540 --> 29:58.739
and in her car we found
a table numbe_r
placer for table nine,

29:59.420 --> 30:00.956
but she sat at table 17.

30:01.050 --> 30:03.701
I don't understand.
What does that
have to do with me?

30:03.800 --> 30:05.165
You were at table nine.

30:05.670 --> 30:07.376
If you say so.
I don't remember.

30:07.470 --> 30:10.007
Were you in the car with Laura
when it went into the water?

30:10.100 --> 30:11.135
Excuse me?

30:11.220 --> 30:13.552
Were you having
an affair With Laura Parks?

30:14.680 --> 30:17.183
For whatever it's worth,
I was not.

30:17.690 --> 30:21.569
But I wasn't the only
person at table nine.

30:21.900 --> 30:25.188
And, as I recall,
that particular fundraiser,

30:25.280 --> 30:27.066
I was there
until the bitter end.

30:27.150 --> 30:30.529
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to get to
my nephew's wedding.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.985
Before you go, quick question.

30:32.080 --> 30:35.823
Can anyone confirm that
you were at the fundraiser
until the very end?

30:35.910 --> 30:37.036
Chris.

30:37.120 --> 30:38.109
Sir.

30:38.250 --> 30:39.626
The fundraiser,
What time did we
end up leaving?

30:40.170 --> 30:41.990
Had to be after
1:00 in the morning.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.162
You spent a feW hours working
on your speech for
the President's Council.

30:50.430 --> 30:53.058
I am truly sorry
about Laura Parks' death,

30:53.140 --> 30:57.509
but if you have any
further questions,
please talk to my lawyer.

30:57.600 --> 30:58.840
Chris will see you out.

31:00.100 --> 31:01.601
It's right this way.
You know What?

31:01.690 --> 31:04.147
We're good, Chris.
We can show ourselves out.

31:07.320 --> 31:10.448
Noonan has a photograph
of a cabin in there.
What about it?

31:10.570 --> 31:14.074
I saw a picture of Laura
in front of that
exact same cabin.

31:14.160 --> 31:15.536
Noonan's lying.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.247
Could be they were
having an affair.

31:17.330 --> 31:18.740
Noonan's running
for governor.

31:18.830 --> 31:21.742
Maybe she was threatening
to tell his wife, go public?

31:21.830 --> 31:24.549
So he shuts her up,
for good.

31:29.800 --> 31:31.427
According to Chris Kane,
his boss, Noonan,

31:31.510 --> 31:33.421
was working on
a speech all night

31:33.510 --> 31:35.842
for the President's
CounCIl on Economics.

31:35.970 --> 31:38.427
If the alibi about
the speech is a lie,

31:38.520 --> 31:40.135
if Kane's
covering for his boss,

31:40.270 --> 31:43.728
Noonan could have
been in that car
when it went off the bridge.

31:43.810 --> 31:47.473
Guy like that
goes to a fundraiser,
driver brings him.

31:47.610 --> 31:49.566
Limo driver said he
had the night off.

31:49.650 --> 31:52.198
He said Noonan was testing out
his new Aston Martin.

31:52.320 --> 31:53.947
Aston Martin, figures.
All right, folks.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.446
Check it out.
I just started looking
into Free City, right?

31:57.540 --> 31:58.689
The charity that
Laura worked for,

31:58.830 --> 32:00.115
that Noonan was
on the board of?

32:01.330 --> 32:04.788
Looks like they defaulted
to the tune of $790,000.

32:12.380 --> 32:15.929
Jay. Get me everything
I need to see Free
City's bank accounts

32:16.010 --> 32:17.420
going back for
the last five years.

32:17.510 --> 32:20.673
Laura had a note
in her room, 790.

32:20.810 --> 32:24.359
$790,000.
Maybe she knew
What was going on.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.510
Noonanis
the chairman of that charity.

32:26.650 --> 32:29.027
If he's making
a play for governor,
the last thing he needs

32:29.150 --> 32:32.608
is for three-quarters
of $1 million to vanish
from those accounts.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.191
Sounds like it's
worth having another
conversation with Noonan.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.737
Good luck With that.
He's completely lawyered up.

32:37.870 --> 32:40.282
Besides, we don't have
enough for a warrant to
get him in here.

32:40.370 --> 32:42.497
Well, we don't
really need a warrant.

32:42.580 --> 32:46.493
We just need a shot
at talking to 250 of Tom
Noonan's closest friends.

32:46.590 --> 32:48.296
We're gonna crash a wedding,
aren't we, Al?

32:48.920 --> 32:49.875
Yeah.

32:52.170 --> 32:54.718
Baby, what you doing now?

32:54.840 --> 32:58.389
You're pissin' me off

32:59.930 --> 33:03.514
Your hair is so luxurious

33:03.600 --> 33:06.603
And your lips
are so soft

33:08.270 --> 33:11.398
Ooh, look at all this.
Must have cost a fortune.

33:11.530 --> 33:13.600
Slightly nicer
than the last
wedding we went to.

33:13.740 --> 33:15.947
Sarah and Jeb's,
August 23rd, 2001.

33:16.070 --> 33:17.651
It was by a lake,
and I remember

33:17.740 --> 33:19.150
that you teared up
during their vows.

33:19.240 --> 33:21.288
Pollen count was off
the charts up there.

33:21.580 --> 33:22.535
Hey, how you doing?

33:22.620 --> 33:25.828
This is invitation only,
and I asked you

33:25.920 --> 33:28.081
to speak to my
lawyer if you want...

33:28.170 --> 33:30.491
And then I asked you
if you were having
an affair With Laura Parks.

33:30.590 --> 33:32.546
I told you I didn't.
Really?

33:32.630 --> 33:35.292
That's interesting,
because I got a picture of her

33:35.430 --> 33:38.217
outside your private cabin
in the Adirondacks.

33:38.300 --> 33:42.009
Leave now,
or I Will have your badges.

33:42.100 --> 33:45.433
Talk to me now,
or I'm gonna make
a big scene at this wedding,

33:45.520 --> 33:49.559
right in front of your wife
and maybe talk about your
little affair with Laura!

33:49.650 --> 33:51.106
This is kind of her
thing at weddings.

33:51.190 --> 33:52.475
Well, not all weddings.

33:52.610 --> 33:53.816
What about Mark and Kari's?

33:54.280 --> 33:55.349
Well, that was
kind of a scene.

33:55.450 --> 33:56.940
Right?
Right.

33:57.070 --> 33:58.651
You should start talking.
Definitely.

34:00.120 --> 34:01.439
All right.

34:01.790 --> 34:06.864
I had a brief
liaison with Laura
nearly two years ago.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.999
ButI had nothing
to do with the car
accident or her death,

34:12.130 --> 34:14.007
and we hadn't
spoken in months.

34:14.630 --> 34:16.791
Now, I have a plane to catch,

34:16.880 --> 34:21.135
so unless you have a warrant,
get off my estate.

34:24.680 --> 34:27.808
Well, I think
Noonan's definitely
through talking to us.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.188
At least he admitted
he was havmg
an affair With Laura.

34:31.860 --> 34:34.602
Now, there's someone
who might have
some information.

34:35.150 --> 34:36.811
Maybe he'll talk to us.

34:40.870 --> 34:41.859
Hey, Chris!

34:43.160 --> 34:45.321
Hey.
Good to see you again.

34:45.410 --> 34:46.536
What can I do for you?

34:46.660 --> 34:50.699
Actually, um,
well, you know Free City,
Laura Parks' charity?

34:50.830 --> 34:51.831
Sure.

34:51.920 --> 34:55.333
We understand that
Mr. Noonan was incredibly
devoted to that charity.

34:55.420 --> 34:56.546
Very.

34:56.670 --> 35:00.424
We also understand that
he was incredibly
devoted to Laura Parks.

35:02.180 --> 35:04.557
Did you know
the IRS was investigating

35:04.680 --> 35:06.671
Free City for
misappropriation of funds?

35:06.770 --> 35:07.839
What?

35:07.980 --> 35:11.359
$790,000 missing
from the charity's accounts.

35:11.480 --> 35:12.765
I had no idea.

35:12.860 --> 35:14.521
Do you think
Noonan kneW about that?

35:14.650 --> 35:15.685
Because Laura did.

35:15.780 --> 35:18.351
You wanna rethink
being his alibi the night
of the fundraiser?

35:19.360 --> 35:20.600
Oh, God.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.486
I never should
have vouched for him.

35:24.700 --> 35:25.826
You guys gotta protect me.

35:25.910 --> 35:27.195
Talk to us, and we will.

35:29.580 --> 35:32.879
Yeah.
Noonan came to me that night.
Soaking wet.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.458
He said that Laura
had approached him
after the fundraiser

35:36.550 --> 35:39.257
and said that
she was gonna tell his
Wife about the affair

35:39.380 --> 35:41.712
and the missing money
if he didn't pay her off.

35:41.840 --> 35:43.000
Blackmail.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.170
So he got into her car.
She was driving.

35:45.260 --> 35:46.591
They argued.

35:46.720 --> 35:49.883
She lost control,
they were in the water,
and he got out.

35:49.980 --> 35:52.016
He swam away.

35:52.100 --> 35:54.477
No, he left her to die,
is What he did.

35:54.570 --> 35:56.891
He told me that
he tried to help,
but he couldn't get her out.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.395
I believed him.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.566
So I helped him
with his alibi.

36:02.160 --> 36:04.481
Look,
you may not believe this,
but Noonan is a great man.

36:04.580 --> 36:05.820
He could be a great governor.

36:05.910 --> 36:08.117
But then that reporter
started asking questions.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.239
Nate Orton.

36:09.370 --> 36:10.746
He said that
he had a video.

36:10.870 --> 36:12.417
He was working on a story.
He asked ifI had a comment.

36:12.540 --> 36:16.089
I didn't tell him anything,
but I did tell Tom,

36:16.960 --> 36:19.167
and he said he was
gonna take care of it.

36:20.760 --> 36:22.967
The next thing I know,
the guy's dead in
an armed robbery.

36:23.090 --> 36:24.637
Well, that wasn't
an armed robbery.

36:25.100 --> 36:27.500
What the hell is happening?
I mean, you think Noonan
had this guy killed?

36:27.600 --> 36:29.420
We're gonna find out.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.009
AL: Excuse me, Mr. Noonan.

36:37.730 --> 36:40.392
I'm headed to
a technology conference
in Seattle. No more questions.

36:40.490 --> 36:42.640
We don't have any questions.
We're arresting you

36:43.820 --> 36:45.811
for the murders of
Nate Orton and Bud Mayer.

36:51.660 --> 36:54.288
AL: Went directly from
Bob's Quickie Mart
to right here.

36:57.670 --> 36:58.705
What can I do for you?

37:01.170 --> 37:02.216
Fire away.

37:02.590 --> 37:04.421
Al, I'll be right back.

37:09.720 --> 37:11.096
CARRIE: Hey, Chris.

37:11.980 --> 37:13.971
We just arrested your boss.

37:14.650 --> 37:17.107
Is there anything I can do?

37:17.980 --> 37:19.470
Must be crazy.

37:19.570 --> 37:22.562
You know,
I can't even imagine
What it must be like

37:22.650 --> 37:24.481
working with
someone so closely

37:24.610 --> 37:26.407
and having no idea
who they really are.

37:27.950 --> 37:30.327
How did he take it?
Ah! You know, not well.

37:30.410 --> 37:32.537
I mean, poor Noonan.

37:32.660 --> 37:35.072
Hmm.
Had to drop his
fancy cigar, right?

37:35.170 --> 37:36.785
A perfectly good
Montecristo.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.086
You know your cigars.

37:38.170 --> 37:39.831
No, not me, my partner.

37:39.920 --> 37:42.002
He likes nothing
more than a good brandy

37:42.130 --> 37:44.872
and a nice Romeo
and Julieta No 4.

37:45.510 --> 37:46.966
I've got something
special for him.

37:47.050 --> 37:48.039
Oh.

37:53.430 --> 37:54.840
EDDIE: Guy held his breath
for three minutes.

37:54.980 --> 37:56.049
CARRIE: Wow.

37:58.230 --> 38:00.391
EDDIE: Bud Mayer.
He's a hitman.

38:01.360 --> 38:03.521
I'm the one who buys
Noonan his Cubans.

38:03.610 --> 38:07.068
But I keep a few for myself.
These, these are
the best in the world.

38:07.990 --> 38:10.367
That's so nice of you.
Thank you.
He'll appreciate that.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.900
Coast Guard, huh?

38:16.540 --> 38:18.076
Yep.
Search and Rescue.

38:18.210 --> 38:19.666
Wow! That's impressive.

38:19.750 --> 38:23.208
I heard the training
for that is, is brutal.

38:23.300 --> 38:27.464
You gotta hold
your breath underwater
for What, three minutes?

38:31.640 --> 38:32.925
Congratulations.

38:34.310 --> 38:35.345
You got me.

38:35.890 --> 38:37.096
Put your gun on the desk.

38:37.230 --> 38:38.470
Listen...

38:38.810 --> 38:41.358
Put your gun on the desk!

38:42.230 --> 38:43.356
Sure.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.151
I get it.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.982
Laura noticed
the money missmg
from Free City's accounts,

38:51.070 --> 38:52.071
and she comes to you.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.077
Maybe you didn't
mean to kill her.
We can work with that.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.617
I didn't kill her.
You don't know
What happened.

38:57.040 --> 38:58.075
Was it all about money?

38:58.170 --> 38:59.410
You have no idea
What it's about.

38:59.540 --> 39:01.496
Not you, not that
son of a bitch Noonan.

39:01.590 --> 39:02.625
Okay.

39:03.340 --> 39:05.126
You know,
I've had bosses like him.

39:06.340 --> 39:08.626
I mean,
you're a war hero, right?

39:08.760 --> 39:10.796
And the man has you
doing seating charts.

39:10.930 --> 39:12.295
I work hard.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.250
I deserve that money.

39:14.350 --> 39:18.059
So you skimmed
a little, right?
Laura noticed and...

39:18.440 --> 39:19.930
Yeah. I saw her driving away.

39:20.020 --> 39:22.978
I flag her down,
I tried to reason with her.

39:23.150 --> 39:26.779
But she got angry,
and the car,
it started to fishtail.

39:26.860 --> 39:29.272
I tried to grab the Wheel,
but the next thing I knew,

39:29.400 --> 39:31.106
we were going
over the bridge.

39:31.530 --> 39:35.409
And I reached over
to unbuckle Laura's seatbelt,

39:35.490 --> 39:39.449
and then I looked
in her face,

39:41.960 --> 39:44.451
and I thought that
ifI let her die,

39:45.920 --> 39:47.876
all my problems
die with her.

39:48.470 --> 39:52.008
I would've been fine,
until Nate Orton_
started asking questions.

39:52.140 --> 39:53.505
So you call your
old Coast Guard

39:53.640 --> 39:56.712
buddy-turned-hitman,
Bud Mayer.

39:56.850 --> 39:58.977
You lure Nate down
to the Quickie Mart,

39:59.060 --> 40:01.472
and then all you had to do
was get back to the Bronx,
take care of Mayer.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.728
And then when you realized
that we were gonna pin
the Whole thing on Noonan,

40:04.820 --> 40:05.969
you let him drown, too.

40:06.610 --> 40:08.100
That's enough.

40:08.650 --> 40:10.481
It's time to go.
You're gonna
walk me out of here.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.656
You're not gonna
get away with this.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.150
Turn around.

40:15.370 --> 40:17.031
Go!
All right.

40:26.500 --> 40:27.626
AL: Carrie.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.007
Yup.
Where you been?

40:29.130 --> 40:32.338
Ah, you know,
just hanging out.

40:32.430 --> 40:35.172
But I'm doing
just fine, Roscoe.

40:35.260 --> 40:36.466
Roscoe?

40:37.930 --> 40:39.306
Drop it, or I'll shoot her.

40:39.390 --> 40:42.018
No one needs to
get shot here, right?
It's okay.

40:42.100 --> 40:43.931
Just take a breath.

40:51.700 --> 40:52.689
What?

40:54.110 --> 40:55.190
Not bad, Daytona.

40:55.280 --> 40:56.577
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:58.740 --> 41:00.617
CARRIE: Hi.
EDDIE: Damn.

41:00.700 --> 41:02.031
Again with saving your asses.

41:02.120 --> 41:03.360
I had that shot.

41:03.460 --> 41:04.996
Oh, really?
I thought you were
in Florida.

41:05.460 --> 41:07.166
Luclq for you,
I changed my mind.

41:07.250 --> 41:08.797
Yeah, well, that was
a pretty shitty
way to say goodbye.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.871
You told me to leave.
No, I didn't tell you
to leave.

41:11.010 --> 41:12.295
You know, don't worry
about it, all right?

41:12.380 --> 41:16.009
Fortunately, I can take it.
I don't give up that easy.

41:16.090 --> 41:18.046
Yeah, good thing for me.

41:19.060 --> 41:21.096
Because of, you know,

41:21.220 --> 41:22.221
the case.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.686
'Cause of the case.
'Cause of the case.

41:24.770 --> 41:25.759
Hmm.

41:30.900 --> 41:32.481
That was pretty smart
with that Roscoe business.

41:33.320 --> 41:35.402
Yeah, well, I'm impressed
that you remembered.

41:35.530 --> 41:37.316
I must be rubbing off on you.

41:37.410 --> 41:40.402
How could I forget?
Roscoe Felton took you
hostage in that bank.

41:40.490 --> 41:42.151
You barely got out
of that one alive.

41:42.450 --> 41:45.032
You almost had a heart attack.
You worry about me too much.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.280
What's wrong with that?

41:48.540 --> 41:49.529
AW...

41:50.090 --> 41:51.830
Oh, no.

41:53.050 --> 41:55.257
Hope that's not a sign.
A sign?

41:55.840 --> 41:57.330
You don't believe in signs.

41:57.430 --> 41:59.842
Speaking of which,
you owe me
an apology and my psychic.

41:59.930 --> 42:00.965
For what?

42:01.100 --> 42:03.591
She said a handsome man
was gonna enter my life,

42:03.680 --> 42:05.136
and guess What,
Eddie showed up.

42:05.270 --> 42:07.591
Eddie doesn't count.
He's not that handsome.

42:08.770 --> 42:10.897
He's handsome.
Not as handsome as you.

42:11.480 --> 42:12.435
Yeah...

42:14.280 --> 42:16.441
They have no idea
What they're in for.

42:16.820 --> 42:18.447
Think you'll ever
get married again?

42:18.530 --> 42:20.862
No. I am not
the marrying kind,
trust me.

42:21.160 --> 42:22.149
Hmm.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.109
What about you?

42:25.120 --> 42:28.453
Life's pretty good.
Why fix it if it ain't broke?
