WEBVTT

00:13.972 --> 00:16.057
I think moving on forward,
if there’s something

00:16.099 --> 00:19.519
upsetting you, then I think
we just speak about it first.

00:19.561 --> 00:22.105
Stop arguments
later down the line.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.148
Okay, I agree with that.

00:23.189 --> 00:25.692
I am genuinely apologetic.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.986
I’m genuinely...
I’m gonna miss you two.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.863
-Do you need a hand there?
-Nah, I’m all good, thanks.

00:29.904 --> 00:31.531
She’s a ----ing weapon.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.491
I think Courts is finding her
feet very well as lead deckhand.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.909
I think Courtney deserved it.

00:34.951 --> 00:36.036
Wacker on, Johnny.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.078
Oh, and there’s our crew.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.538
-Hi, guys.
-Hi!

00:38.580 --> 00:40.999
I’ve had a charter broker
as a guest before.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.625
It was actually a nightmare.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.669
This is the party pad.

00:48.173 --> 00:49.799
So, this is the wave...
see this?

00:49.841 --> 00:51.134
Oh, my goodness.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.510
-This is meters.
-Yeah.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.054
Well, we can’t leave the dock.

00:54.095 --> 00:57.599
Tomorrow, the minute
it lays down, I’ll take off.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.732
Mother---er.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.651
I do want Dave to realize
that there are boundaries.

01:18.203 --> 01:19.537
We’ll go round
the table with it.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.872
Oh, I thought we were
gonna present it

01:20.914 --> 01:22.540
and be like,
here’s your chicken...

01:22.582 --> 01:23.750
Yeah, go all round the table,
then we dish out.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.251
Yeah.

01:25.293 --> 01:26.711
That this point it’s just,
like, embarrassing.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.425
All right, good night,
everybody.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.551
Thank you guys so
much for dinner.

01:33.593 --> 01:34.719
-Bye!
-Thank you so much.

01:37.722 --> 01:39.849
[crash]

01:39.891 --> 01:41.101
Oh!

01:41.142 --> 01:43.728
Nat!

01:43.770 --> 01:46.147
Stay there, stay there,
stay there.

01:51.111 --> 01:54.364
-Oh!
-Do you need medical?

01:54.406 --> 01:55.365
You twisted your ankle?

01:55.407 --> 01:56.783
-Oh sh--.
-Oh!

01:56.825 --> 01:58.410
Stay there, stay there,
stay there.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.161
Can you get Captain Sandy?

02:00.203 --> 02:02.080
-Storm, Storm, to the pantry.
-Ah!

02:02.122 --> 02:04.791
Storm, Storm, to the pantry.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.626
Captain Sandy, to the pantry,
please.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.419
Kyle has fallen.

02:07.460 --> 02:09.546
[bleep]’s sake.

02:09.587 --> 02:14.467
I’m just gonna grab an ice pack.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.343
[knocks]

02:15.385 --> 02:16.636
Where did you fall, mate?

02:16.678 --> 02:18.054
Just... he’s just fallen
down the stairs.

02:18.096 --> 02:19.180
Just get an ice pack
from the ice...

02:19.222 --> 02:22.392
-Oh, ah!
-Just go up here.

02:29.107 --> 02:31.443
Oh!

02:31.484 --> 02:32.861
[crying]

02:32.902 --> 02:34.487
-Is it this one?
-No.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.990
-This one?
-I can take care of it.

02:37.032 --> 02:40.160
-Have you got an ice pack?
-The ice pack’s coming.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.578
Oh!

02:41.619 --> 02:43.163
-Kyle, come here.
-Okay.

02:43.204 --> 02:44.914
Let’s just assess you, mate.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.709
What did you feel when you fell?

02:47.751 --> 02:49.127
Just pain.

02:49.169 --> 02:52.005
We get him to a couch and
then he needs to lay down.

02:52.047 --> 02:54.299
Let’s keep an ice pack on his
foot to keep the swelling...

02:54.341 --> 02:56.176
Okay.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.345
The blanket nice and warm.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.512
Okay, which is your
good foot, this one?

02:59.554 --> 03:01.348
The left one’s sore, honey.

03:01.389 --> 03:03.516
Is that Capitano?

03:03.558 --> 03:07.562
We just had Kyle fall.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.397
No, just lean your weight on me,
I got you.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.025
A perfect leaning post.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.319
Kyle just fell over.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.154
He’s rolled his ankle,
he was crying.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.781
-Okay.
-Oh.

03:17.822 --> 03:19.199
All right.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.533
So, we’ve got him on the couch

03:20.575 --> 03:22.660
and we’ve got an ice
pack on his leg.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.747
Just needed to put ice
on for a second,

03:25.789 --> 03:28.375
-and then I’ll strap it.
-Yeah, we’ll put the ice here.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.754
Kyle, what happened?

03:32.796 --> 03:35.715
The small step around
the corner, I missed it.

03:35.757 --> 03:36.800
Which one?

03:36.841 --> 03:38.051
-The corner--
-Can I see your foot?

03:38.093 --> 03:40.804
-Of course, Cap.
-Ah!

03:40.845 --> 03:43.765
You couldn’t see it
from there.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.725
Oh, yeah.

03:45.767 --> 03:47.227
If you can’t put weight on it,

03:47.268 --> 03:49.020
then you need to go
to the hospital.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.816
I’m like, is it broken,
is he okay?

03:52.857 --> 03:54.234
I’m concerned.

03:54.275 --> 03:56.027
Okay, just lean on me,
just lean on me... there you go.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.153
There we go.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.822
He needs to get an X-ray.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.623
All right, message us
if you need anything.

04:08.665 --> 04:09.624
You’ve got everything
in your pocket,

04:09.666 --> 04:11.292
and your shoes in the pink bag.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.632
Well, I guess
we’re on lates tonight.

04:18.550 --> 04:19.801
It’s gonna be okay.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.594
Maybe Courtney can come
help us tomorrow.

04:21.636 --> 04:23.763
Courtney’s now lead deck,
so she’s not...

04:23.805 --> 04:25.640
Oh sh--.

04:27.308 --> 04:28.935
Let’s just smash it out.

04:28.977 --> 04:31.354
We’ll do upstairs together,
work out there, clean it up.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.439
-Yeah.
-Clean it out, run down here...

04:32.480 --> 04:33.690
We’ll just do it together,

04:33.732 --> 04:34.691
everything feels worse
if we separate.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.151
Yeah, we’ll be dead.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.445
The interior team are
really taking the pressure

04:38.486 --> 04:40.572
of being stuck at the dock.

04:40.613 --> 04:44.617
So, to lose one from your team,
I literally feel sick.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.578
And then to see Kyle in pain

04:46.619 --> 04:50.081
is, like, one of
the most upsetting things.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.624
My heart is in my stomach.

04:51.666 --> 04:54.502
-He’ll be okay.
-Yeah.

05:01.676 --> 05:03.053
All right, get some sleep.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.179
Wait, what time are you
getting up?

05:04.220 --> 05:05.430
I’m obviously 6:15.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.973
What time shall I get up...
7:00.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.517
God, I’m gonna be
knackered tomorrow.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.479
All right, let’s go to bed now.

05:23.073 --> 05:24.407
[bleep] man.

05:45.512 --> 05:46.888
He’s coming back.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.489
So, I just strained
my ligaments in my foot.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.074
Mm-hmm, just rolled it
over, hey?

06:06.116 --> 06:07.534
Correct, so they, like...

06:07.575 --> 06:08.952
-This side?
-Yeah.

06:08.993 --> 06:10.620
It’s not broken,
that’s the good news.

06:10.662 --> 06:12.038
Thank God, it’s just sore now.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.623
-Yeah, yeah.
-It’s kicking in proper now.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.208
It’s gonna throb when
you’re in bed.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.293
I honestly feel so thankful
that it’s not broken,

06:17.335 --> 06:20.839
but the doctor said
that I have to be off my foot

06:20.880 --> 06:21.923
for seven days.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.425
Being gay and working
in the interior,

06:23.466 --> 06:25.969
I face so many walls
to overcome.

06:26.011 --> 06:27.721
I don’t want people to look
at me and be like,

06:27.762 --> 06:29.556
yeah, you know, he’s soft,

06:29.597 --> 06:31.266
of course he’s gonna
take this time off.

06:31.307 --> 06:32.809
I’m gonna be a laundry one.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.519
Halfway through this charter,
and only one left.

06:34.561 --> 06:36.855
There we go.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.190
Oh, thank you so much for
staying up, it means the world.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.400
Of course.

06:40.442 --> 06:41.568
Oh, my God, you’re back.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.862
So... What have they said?

06:43.903 --> 06:46.781
-I stretched my ligaments, yeah.
-[bleep].

06:46.823 --> 06:48.575
This is not how I’m going out.

06:48.616 --> 06:50.243
I know, I don’t want
you to leave.

06:50.285 --> 06:51.619
I can’t cover for you either.

06:51.661 --> 06:55.081
No worries, I’m gonna
do what I can do.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.000
There must be a way,
I can’t leave.

06:57.042 --> 06:58.335
No.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.545
I’ve fought damn hard to be
in this position,

07:00.587 --> 07:02.130
and I want to be here.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.675
All I’m thinking, you know what,
I’m gonna be sent home.

07:22.150 --> 07:23.526
[alarm sounds]

07:33.286 --> 07:34.579
If you wanna start from sundeck,

07:34.621 --> 07:35.663
I’ll come meet you
and help you now

07:35.705 --> 07:38.124
What the [bleep]
are we gonna do?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.627
It still looks terrible.

07:40.669 --> 07:43.296
Storm, Storm, Sandy,
meet me in the bridge.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.799
Copy that, on my way.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.176
Is there any more
dishwashing tablets?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.846
Is that all there is?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.770
I don’t think we can
leave the dock today.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.647
-If it starts to lay down...
-Yeah.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.566
But don’t count on it.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.318
I’ll let them know
we’re not leaving the dock.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.820
[bleep]

08:06.861 --> 08:09.531
You could also do the water
sports in that corner.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.491
-It wasn’t bad.
-Oh, is it better today?

08:11.533 --> 08:13.159
-Yeah.
-All right.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.079
It’s literally "Bold and the
Beautiful" in the galley.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.330
Why?

08:17.372 --> 08:18.873
I’m literally the middle person.

08:18.915 --> 08:21.418
It’ll be like, "Tell Natasha
I want an avocado."

08:21.459 --> 08:23.253
"He wants an avocado."

08:23.294 --> 08:25.005
I’m really confused
at this sitch,

08:25.046 --> 08:27.298
because they’re
literally brawling.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.014
Okay, guys, we’re not gonna
abandon the interior department.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.349
-Yeah.
-They’ll be short-handed.

08:36.391 --> 08:37.851
Help them however you can.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.644
I’m gonna try and
get them in the water.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.730
Still too much swell
to leave the dock?

08:41.771 --> 08:44.024
Going to try in the tender.

08:44.065 --> 08:45.984
These guests are used
to the world of yachting,

08:46.026 --> 08:49.320
so that adds extra pressure
on myself and interior.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.197
Now there’s, like,
lots of eyes on us.

08:51.239 --> 08:56.745
We can take them on a cruise,
and then Seabobs, eFoil, and...

08:56.786 --> 08:58.204
-Yeah.
-Stand-up paddleboards.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.707
I can delegate our team
to different departments.

09:00.749 --> 09:04.377
Let’s do what we would do on
the water, just get involved.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.296
Right now I think our tip’s,
like, $30.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.715
Oh, lovely.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.675
Have you ordered
any fruit, Natasha?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.135
I don’t order fruit.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.678
If you want me to order fruit,
just let me know.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.055
So, obviously, I’m not...

09:15.096 --> 09:16.514
So, is there any more
dishwashing tablets?

09:16.556 --> 09:17.724
So, obviously, I’m not
in control of that.

09:17.766 --> 09:19.017
Natasha... okay.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.560
Is there any more
dishwashing tablets?

09:20.602 --> 09:22.228
-No, I’ve given...
- That’s all there is?

09:22.270 --> 09:23.396
I ordered some, but obviously
they’ve not come

09:23.438 --> 09:24.606
if they’re not there.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.899
-Hey, good morning.
-Morning, Sandy,

09:25.940 --> 09:27.233
Could you come in
the galley with me?

09:27.275 --> 09:28.193
Yeah, sure.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.322
-Good morning.
-Hello.

09:32.364 --> 09:34.949
Good morning. Would you
stop cutting for a minute?

09:34.991 --> 09:38.244
All right, so, there’s
tension here, I can feel it.

09:38.286 --> 09:41.289
Last night, service was slow;
I don’t know why.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.792
You guys, whatever
you’re going through,

09:43.833 --> 09:45.335
you gotta work through,
because we...

09:45.377 --> 09:47.003
this is our last two charters.

09:47.045 --> 09:49.255
I wanna end on a high note.

09:49.297 --> 09:53.301
So, put aside whatever it is
and be professionals.

09:57.555 --> 09:58.765
Coming up...

09:58.807 --> 10:00.642
Oh sh--.
Mzi?

10:10.860 --> 10:12.112
Last night, service was slow;
I don’t know why.

10:13.697 --> 10:16.199
It was chaos,
it was absolute chaos.

10:16.241 --> 10:18.660
So, figure it out.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.037
I need you guys to rise above

10:21.079 --> 10:24.791
and think about the entire crew
and the experience,

10:24.833 --> 10:27.002
and not your feelings
and emotions.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.587
-Yeah.
-This is our last two charters.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.047
I wanna end on a high note.

10:31.089 --> 10:33.216
Let’s just continue that.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.135
-All right, thanks.
-Okay.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.100
Ah!

10:42.142 --> 10:44.811
-Good morning.
-Good morning, how are you?

10:44.853 --> 10:46.229
-Good.
-Morning.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.648
Actually, if I can get an
iced latte, please?

10:48.690 --> 10:49.858
-Yeah, sure.
-Same thing.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.318
-Okay, same, easy.
-We’re easy.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.903
We’re gonna do breakfast
right now.

10:56.573 --> 10:59.034
Aw, how lovely.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.326
Hey.

11:03.079 --> 11:04.789
-Captain Sandy?
-Si!

11:04.831 --> 11:07.584
Hello, the guests asked
if you’d like

11:07.625 --> 11:09.377
to eat with them this morning.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.337
Breakfast.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.630
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

11:12.672 --> 11:13.923
Thank you.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.218
Does yours taste
a little weird?

11:17.260 --> 11:18.553
Mine’s a little funny.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.055
[imitates blender]

11:21.890 --> 11:24.059
I need a nice, hearty breakfast.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.898
Captain Sandy’s coming to join
us for breakfast.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.567
I am, like, praying to God
we go out at sea.

11:32.609 --> 11:33.568
-Morning.
-Good morning.

11:33.610 --> 11:34.903
Hi, Sandy.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.864
Is there a way to do
water sports today?

11:37.906 --> 11:40.241
Yeah, we were saying maybe
if we do get out,

11:40.283 --> 11:42.035
we could do, like,
nighttime water sports.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.579
Well, you know,
I looked at the seas.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.122
They’re so big.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.290
Oh.

11:47.332 --> 11:48.583
It’s terrible, I’m sorry.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.085
So, what we’re gonna do is

11:50.126 --> 11:52.087
there’s a corner
inside the port.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.089
But maybe we could do
that with the tender.

11:54.130 --> 11:57.425
Yeah, so they have Seabobs,
paddleboards.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.219
Okay, let’s do that.

11:59.260 --> 12:02.180
Is it telling that the boat
is rocking, even in port?

12:02.222 --> 12:04.182
These stairs are dangerous.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.059
Actually, I was gonna
tell you later,

12:06.101 --> 12:07.936
Kyle took a
bad fall last night.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.438
-Oh! Oh, really?
-His ankle is really bad.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.815
Figures... our luck.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.818
So, this is gonna be
extremely difficult,

12:14.859 --> 12:16.277
but we’re gonna do it.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.904
Basically just wanna get
everything on the tender,

12:17.946 --> 12:21.116
set the NautiBuoy up and
leave Reid with it, just,

12:21.157 --> 12:23.785
like, floating around
like a castaway.

12:23.827 --> 12:25.078
Awesome.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.371
Set up, come back,
pick them up, take them.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.289
After this little thing
gets out,

12:28.331 --> 12:30.041
do you mind if I then pop
in the cabins and the boys...

12:30.083 --> 12:31.292
No, go for it.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.752
[grunts]

12:32.794 --> 12:35.797
I am aware of how much we
need to impress the guests,

12:35.839 --> 12:37.132
because they’re stuck at dock.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.593
Like, entertain them,
get the water toys out,

12:40.635 --> 12:41.803
and turn them around.

12:41.845 --> 12:44.222
The tip depends on us.
Like, full stop.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.683
Can you have a gyro
with a stabilizer?

12:46.725 --> 12:47.684
We have a hydraulic stabilizer.

12:47.726 --> 12:48.935
Wow.

12:48.977 --> 12:49.978
I wish we could see
it in action.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.146
Hopefully.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.230
I gotta...
I’m falling, so...

12:52.272 --> 12:53.398
I gotta go hoist it over.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.236
Almost fell in the water, mate.

12:58.278 --> 12:59.821
-Cheesy scrambled eggs.
-Thank you so much.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.239
You’re welcome.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.324
Motor Yacht Home,
tender away, tender away.

13:03.366 --> 13:05.660
Oh, my God,
Mom, that looks amazing.

13:05.702 --> 13:08.621
You might need to save me some.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.123
This is so good.

13:10.165 --> 13:12.334
He’s, like, the best chef
I’ve ever had.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.294
Thanks for that
smooth service, Dave.

13:14.336 --> 13:17.255
Um...
Try my best all the time.

13:17.297 --> 13:18.965
-That’s where we’re going.
-All right.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.968
We’re gonna literally tie up the
NautiBuoy to that ----ing rock.

13:22.010 --> 13:23.136
In we go.

13:26.056 --> 13:29.434
I need to do the cabins,
the laundry, oh!

13:38.318 --> 13:40.487
If you need a boat broker,
Lila’s fabulous.

13:40.528 --> 13:43.823
I’m sure she’s fine,
she’s a captain.

13:43.865 --> 13:46.076
Look at this.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.495
See you later, Reid.

13:51.581 --> 13:55.877
Let’s take the tender
and do some water sports.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.087
Yes.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.672
Approaching Motor Yacht Home.

13:58.713 --> 14:01.257
Could you just meet us
on the stern, please?

14:01.299 --> 14:02.884
Enjoy!

14:02.926 --> 14:05.845
Okay, guys, come and jump in.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.514
Mind your head.

14:07.555 --> 14:08.890
Everything’s sorted,
everything’s set up.

14:08.932 --> 14:10.558
But Courtney’s going, right?

14:10.600 --> 14:12.686
-Courtney’s going, yeah.
-Thank you.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.854
Interior, interior,
that’s all guests off

14:14.896 --> 14:16.690
on the tender.

14:16.731 --> 14:18.108
Here you go, guys,

14:18.149 --> 14:19.442
and you’ve got a nice
little superyacht tour.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.948
I don’t want us to mess
these two charters up.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.408
Sorry?

14:26.449 --> 14:28.159
I don’t want us to mess
these two charters up.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.412
We’re not.

14:30.453 --> 14:32.497
What are we gonna do, just
play it out like this, or...

14:34.666 --> 14:37.127
try and work together
properly, because...

14:41.631 --> 14:43.425
So [bleep].

14:43.466 --> 14:46.594
And likewise,
because I can’t be myself,

14:46.636 --> 14:50.265
I can’t be my happy self
that’s got my normal spark.

14:50.306 --> 14:51.933
You know, I feel like it’s gone.

14:51.975 --> 14:53.351
Yeah.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.103
I can’t deal with
the messages, like...

14:56.688 --> 14:58.148
Okay.

14:58.189 --> 15:01.943
Last night, I felt completely
out of control.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.361
I’m still ----ing in
love with her.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.946
That’s just a fact.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.198
But that’s not happening,
so I need to be able

15:07.240 --> 15:09.534
to just push it away
and be professional.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.955
-Hi!
-Hola!

15:13.997 --> 15:15.540
Hi, guys!

15:15.582 --> 15:17.834
Okay, guys, you’re in three
meters of water here,

15:17.876 --> 15:20.587
so you can jump in, you can go
in the Seabobs

15:20.628 --> 15:21.671
all around this area.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.048
You can go on the eFoil.

15:23.923 --> 15:24.966
-Woo!
-Woo!

15:25.008 --> 15:26.343
Are there any sharks here?

15:26.384 --> 15:29.721
No, no, you’ll be fine here.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.181
I’m petrified of sharks.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.974
-Are you?
-Yeah.

15:33.016 --> 15:35.185
Woo!

15:37.979 --> 15:39.230
[chattering]

15:40.440 --> 15:42.984
How the hell do they
call that a bikini?

15:43.026 --> 15:45.028
Yeah?
What do you need?

15:45.070 --> 15:46.154
Look at the bed...

15:46.196 --> 15:47.655
I need Jesus.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.949
-What color is this?
-It’s called "Hot Cheetah."

15:49.991 --> 15:51.284
Hot Cheetah...

15:51.326 --> 15:53.161
Why do you wanna look like a
----ing Cheetah?

15:53.203 --> 15:54.454
You’re telling me, sis.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.664
Can I take this pillowcase off?

15:56.706 --> 15:59.167
Please, I need to strip
the ----ing bed.

15:59.209 --> 16:00.502
[shouting]

16:05.340 --> 16:08.385
Buy a ----ing makeup wipe,
for chrissake.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.886
Are you guys coming back
on the boat,

16:09.928 --> 16:11.554
or are you chilling
there for now?

16:12.639 --> 16:14.265
Yeah?
Yeah?

16:14.307 --> 16:17.602
It’s nice and warm
on the bow anyway.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.423
Mm-hmm.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.718
Everyone good for a drink?

16:49.759 --> 16:51.302
Awesome.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.930
Mzi, I’ll do the anchor.

16:53.972 --> 16:55.432
If you can just hold that line.

17:04.065 --> 17:06.151
Oh sh--.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.612
Mzi, I need your help.

17:11.406 --> 17:12.782
Yeah, I’ve gotta come on back.

17:14.826 --> 17:17.412
This is crazy...
what even is it?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.041
[bleep]

17:21.082 --> 17:22.709
What the [bleep] is going on?

17:22.751 --> 17:24.753
So, the anchor’s
underneath it, hey?

17:33.261 --> 17:33.970
Courtney, nice job on the--

17:34.929 --> 17:36.056
What the [bleep] is that?

17:36.097 --> 17:38.475
It looks like a pipe.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.353
When the anchor’s coming out,
where is it going?

17:44.898 --> 17:46.483
Yeah, I know, guys.

17:46.524 --> 17:49.611
The anchor hook’s picked up
this massive ----ing pipe.

17:49.652 --> 17:51.905
It’s not like I know what
to do in this sitch,

17:51.946 --> 17:55.241
whereas they’ve worked on boats,
they’ve had boats themselves,

17:55.283 --> 17:56.326
one of them’s a yacht broker.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.660
It’s just embarrassing.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.921
In that compartment?

18:07.962 --> 18:09.714
No, two seconds.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.801
Why won’t this... [bleep] me.

18:12.842 --> 18:13.927
Let’s just take a break.

18:13.968 --> 18:14.928
No, no, I’m all good.

18:20.350 --> 18:22.644
Yeah, yeah, okay.

18:22.686 --> 18:23.937
Fantastic idea.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.481
Reid, move out the way
for a sec, please.

18:26.523 --> 18:30.193
Yeah, just get out
the way for a sec.

18:30.235 --> 18:32.237
Mzi, talk to me.

18:34.030 --> 18:34.948
Okay.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.785
What are we seeing,
guys, talk to me.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.417
-Oh!
-Woo!

18:45.458 --> 18:47.127
Thank God for that...

18:47.168 --> 18:50.880
every day is a school day, rah!

18:50.922 --> 18:52.298
Okay, guys, sorry.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.550
You can all sit back down
and enjoy your time again.

18:53.591 --> 18:55.010
-Sorry about that.
-Woo-hoo!

18:56.511 --> 18:59.681
Storm, Storm, Courtney,
15 to 20 minutes.

19:01.599 --> 19:03.476
Do you fancy doing
welcome drinks, Nat?

19:03.518 --> 19:04.894
Wait, what cocktail?

19:04.936 --> 19:06.438
Is that--

19:06.479 --> 19:07.731
No, I was gonna say
I’ll make the welcome cocktail

19:07.772 --> 19:09.858
if you fancy doing
the welcome drinks.

19:13.945 --> 19:17.824
Storm, Storm, Sandy, Courtney’s
gonna dock at that little dock.

19:17.866 --> 19:19.617
Copy that.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.456
Storm, you have no idea what
we’ve just been through.

19:24.497 --> 19:25.999
What happened?

19:26.041 --> 19:28.793
The anchor brought up a pipe.

19:28.835 --> 19:31.546
That sounds intense,
are you guys okay?

19:34.299 --> 19:36.217
She’s a unit, I love her.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.095
Thank you, guys,
sorry again about that.

19:39.137 --> 19:40.347
Oh, you don’t need to help us?

19:40.388 --> 19:42.140
Well, of course I am.

19:42.182 --> 19:44.017
-My lady.
-Thank you.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.685
Jumping on.

19:48.063 --> 19:51.649
Oh, yeah we’ll be...

19:51.691 --> 19:55.570
Tash, Tash, interior, guests on
board, all guests are on board.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.116
I washed this ----ing
yesterday.

20:00.158 --> 20:01.659
Hop in the tub.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.287
Mini-margaritas,
if you’d like one.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.998
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.335
I’ve got the guests on board.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.337
Courtney handled it
like a boss, apparently,

20:12.379 --> 20:13.630
and it’s--

20:13.672 --> 20:15.131
Did they have a fun time
with water sports?

20:15.173 --> 20:16.966
Yeah, they said they loved it.

20:17.008 --> 20:18.968
These guests are not happy
they’re stuck at the dock.

20:19.010 --> 20:21.846
All they wanna do is water
sports, and we pulled it off.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.642
So, now, the interior,
they need to take the ball

20:25.684 --> 20:26.810
and knock it out of the park.

20:26.851 --> 20:28.269
You’re doing a great job.

20:28.311 --> 20:29.771
Thanks, Cap.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.944
-Ah!
-Whoa.

20:35.985 --> 20:38.029
All right, okay,
let’s down this.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.490
So, cheers.

20:40.532 --> 20:43.118
-Ah.
-Cheers to a big night.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.661
[laughing]

20:44.703 --> 20:46.287
Gonna hand me those Seabobs.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.414
Yeah, I will.

20:47.455 --> 20:49.582
Kyle, we’re really struggling.

20:49.624 --> 20:50.875
Do you fancy helping us?

20:54.838 --> 20:56.715
Tonight we have a
super special occasion.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.009
It’s Lila’s 21st birthday party.

20:59.050 --> 21:03.513
I know it needs to be perfect to
make up for the charter so far.

21:03.555 --> 21:05.015
We can’t mess it up.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.975
Oh!

21:07.017 --> 21:08.393
Okay, let’s just
keep stuff flowing,

21:08.435 --> 21:10.478
get changed, set the table.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.148
What can we do that’s vibey?

21:13.189 --> 21:14.607
Like, our outfits.

21:14.649 --> 21:16.609
I’m gonna put on my red dress.

21:21.865 --> 21:25.035
I just want you to recognize
how I hold the team up,

21:25.076 --> 21:26.202
and without me...

21:26.244 --> 21:29.414
Oh, I know mate,
I know, buddy.

21:29.456 --> 21:31.124
Dave!

21:31.166 --> 21:32.500
Trust me, I know.

21:32.542 --> 21:34.461
Honestly, if I break
out from this sticker,

21:34.502 --> 21:35.545
I’m literally suing.

21:35.587 --> 21:36.713
Like, I’ve had enough.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.763
Sexy!

21:44.804 --> 21:46.598
[laughing]

21:49.642 --> 21:53.605
Meat cooked well,
shrimp appetizers, filet...

21:53.646 --> 21:56.983
What cutlery do
I need this evening?

21:58.401 --> 22:00.737
There’s a lot of pressure
on the dinner tonight.

22:00.779 --> 22:02.906
Last night’s dinner
was an absolute nightmare.

22:02.947 --> 22:05.784
But now I’ve got
this opportunity of redemption,

22:05.825 --> 22:06.868
I’m gonna go for it.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.495
Okay.
So, to start...

22:08.536 --> 22:10.372
Mushroom-coconut soup
with sea bream.

22:10.413 --> 22:11.539
What’s the course after?

22:11.581 --> 22:13.083
Tuna, mahi-mahi.

22:13.124 --> 22:14.709
Okay, then after that?

22:15.794 --> 22:17.754
All right, thanks, babe.

22:30.392 --> 22:32.143
Look at Gracie.

22:38.733 --> 22:40.735
-You ready?
-I’m ready.

22:45.323 --> 22:47.325
Hold on for dear life,
my little balloon...

22:47.367 --> 22:50.912
you’re representing me today,
holding on by just a string.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.625
You go to laundry and
I’ll stay with the thingie.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.919
-Thank you.
-It looks amazing, thank you.

22:57.961 --> 22:59.295
Goodbye.

22:59.337 --> 23:01.673
Oh, my God, look at
that cake, that’s beautiful.

23:01.715 --> 23:05.385
21, gonna put a load
of sparklers I nit.

23:05.427 --> 23:08.013
I think they’re gonna be wowed.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.015
-Happy birthday.
-Look how pretty this is.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.099
Happy birthday.

23:11.141 --> 23:12.434
They even put a
little banner for me.

23:12.475 --> 23:15.603
-Twenty-one.
-Twenty-one, baby.

23:15.645 --> 23:17.313
The table’s
absolutely beautiful.

23:17.355 --> 23:18.898
Thank you.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.025
Okay, Lila,
where do you wanna sit?

23:20.066 --> 23:22.193
So, Dad, I wanna
sit next to you.

23:22.235 --> 23:23.778
Right, well, one of us
can go on dishes,

23:23.820 --> 23:25.697
one of us can help in cabins,

23:25.739 --> 23:27.407
and another person
can help in service.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.034
Amazing.

23:29.075 --> 23:30.910
If you wanna be more on service,
then I can go round the cabins

23:30.952 --> 23:33.204
with one of the boys,
because you’ve been obviously

23:33.246 --> 23:34.664
in cabins all day, so...

23:34.706 --> 23:36.750
I love anything, you know?

23:37.876 --> 23:41.296
Oh, yes, beautiful goatee.

23:43.715 --> 23:46.426
[chattering]

23:46.468 --> 23:48.887
I wish the weather was better.

23:50.889 --> 23:51.848
Does anyone know
what’s for dinner?

23:51.890 --> 23:53.350
First course this evening,

23:53.391 --> 23:56.770
it’s like a coconut broth
with sea bream into it.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.521
What’s sea bream?

23:58.563 --> 23:59.606
It’s like a fish,
a white fish.

23:59.647 --> 24:00.815
Oh, yeah.

24:00.857 --> 24:02.567
So, you might not
like the fish.

24:05.779 --> 24:07.864
I’m okay if it’s, like,
not fish-fish fish.

24:07.906 --> 24:10.617
Yeah, it’s kind of
like a sea bass.

24:14.287 --> 24:15.872
Nat, would you mind running up?

24:15.914 --> 24:17.123
Copy.

24:17.165 --> 24:18.750
Thank you, I’m gonna
check on the guests.

24:18.792 --> 24:20.919
Just so you’re aware,
Katherine is, like, mm,

24:20.960 --> 24:22.379
well, I don’t like fish.

24:22.420 --> 24:26.049
And then Lila said she
didn’t like raw fish,

24:26.091 --> 24:28.259
and I was, like,
no, it’s not raw.

24:28.301 --> 24:29.386
It’s not raw.

24:29.427 --> 24:30.762
Sh--. It’s a real fishy night.

24:30.804 --> 24:33.556
----ing hell, how the
[bleep] did that happen?

24:33.598 --> 24:35.600
If somebody doesn’t like fish,

24:35.642 --> 24:36.810
it’s not on the
----ing preference sheet

24:36.851 --> 24:38.395
and all my food’s ready to go.

24:38.436 --> 24:39.729
If you do change any dish,

24:39.771 --> 24:41.022
would you let me know,
just for cutlery?

24:41.064 --> 24:42.148
I’m just gonna go for it.

24:42.190 --> 24:43.525
I don’t really know how to...

24:43.566 --> 24:44.859
I don’t know how to tackle it.

24:46.111 --> 24:48.613
So, I’ve got Garold,
Lila, and Grace.

24:48.655 --> 24:49.948
-Okay.
-I’ll enter from the left.

24:49.989 --> 24:52.450
-All right.
-Are you gonna...

24:52.492 --> 24:53.618
Is Cheffie coming up?

24:59.416 --> 25:01.251
Good evening, guys.

25:01.292 --> 25:04.379
For the first course,
it’s sea bream au daurade,

25:04.421 --> 25:05.880
a nice, flaky fish.

25:05.922 --> 25:08.008
And I’ve done, like,
a nice coconut broth

25:08.049 --> 25:09.634
with a selection of
different mushrooms.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.094
I hope you enjoy it.

25:11.136 --> 25:12.846
We’re screwed, aren’t we?

25:13.805 --> 25:15.348
Just open it and take a bite.

25:21.354 --> 25:22.397
Coming up...

25:22.439 --> 25:23.815
Twenty hours, no break.

25:23.857 --> 25:26.526
With Kyle down
we need extra help,

25:44.836 --> 25:46.212
Mom doesn’t like fish.

25:50.008 --> 25:52.719
Oh... are they enjoying it?

25:52.761 --> 25:54.137
I don’t know.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.599
This is actually not bad.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.017
-It’s very good.
-It’s fine.

25:59.059 --> 26:00.894
I’m coming in here
for a bit, because...

26:00.935 --> 26:02.187
Space, please.

26:07.567 --> 26:08.777
I will do the dishes,

26:08.818 --> 26:11.154
you’ve got much more
skillful things

26:11.196 --> 26:13.698
that you need to put
your mind to.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.367
-Storm?
-Yeah?

26:15.408 --> 26:16.785
Are you able to just
help us run

26:16.826 --> 26:18.703
some of these up
to bridge deck bar?

26:18.745 --> 26:20.747
-Yeah.
-Thanks, Storm.

26:26.419 --> 26:28.213
Okay, I need alcohol.

26:34.427 --> 26:37.180
Hey, guys, so next we’ve
got pan-roast tuna,

26:37.222 --> 26:40.892
courgette tagliatelle with
comfit sun-dried tomatoes.

26:40.934 --> 26:42.560
Hope you enjoy it.

26:42.602 --> 26:45.063
And hey, I wanna say thank you
for giving me the fish,

26:45.105 --> 26:46.564
even though I thought
I didn’t even like fish.

26:46.606 --> 26:47.565
Did you eat it?

26:47.607 --> 26:48.566
Obsessed with fish now, I guess.

26:48.608 --> 26:49.984
Oh, awesome.

26:50.026 --> 26:51.945
Yeah, you made some people
some seafood eaters.

26:51.986 --> 26:53.196
-Oh, wicked.
-Yeah.

26:53.238 --> 26:54.614
-So, great job.
-That makes me happy.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.032
-That soup was phenomenal.
-That was excellent.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.283
-Thanks, guys.
-You still got it.

26:57.325 --> 26:58.827
-Thank you.
-Thanks, guys.

26:58.868 --> 27:00.537
I feel so stressed about
the whole situation,

27:00.578 --> 27:03.748
of what’s going on with Tash
and the tension between us

27:03.790 --> 27:06.167
affecting the entire boat,
I needed it.

27:06.209 --> 27:08.837
We both needed that as well.

27:08.878 --> 27:10.880
-That’s good.
-This is delicious.

27:10.922 --> 27:12.090
-Oh, this is amazing.
-Yeah.

27:12.132 --> 27:13.466
This is actually
my favorite thing

27:13.508 --> 27:16.428
-I’ve tasted the entire trip.
-Wow.

27:16.469 --> 27:19.556
Give it a good old college turn,
cool down the glass...

27:19.597 --> 27:21.891
one of the few things
we learned at university.

27:21.933 --> 27:23.351
Okay, let’s go.

27:23.393 --> 27:24.561
Okay, let’s go, let’s go,
let’s go.

27:24.602 --> 27:26.062
Woo!

27:26.104 --> 27:27.480
I’m gonna put this
around her neck

27:27.522 --> 27:29.190
and then you’re gonna
pour it into her mouth.

27:29.232 --> 27:31.651
-Woo!
-Happy birthday!

27:31.693 --> 27:33.236
Woo!

27:34.362 --> 27:36.114
[shouting]

27:41.828 --> 27:43.788
Oh, look at that.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.457
Oh hon, for you!

27:45.498 --> 27:47.000
Oh, thank you.

27:47.042 --> 27:51.004
Thank you, Courtney and Mzi,
for all your housekeeping.

27:51.046 --> 27:53.048
Everything’s amazing,
thank you so much.

27:53.089 --> 27:55.008
You’re welcome.

27:55.050 --> 27:57.010
-Thank you.
-Sorry... you’re welcome.

27:59.554 --> 28:01.848
Hold on!

28:01.890 --> 28:03.808
Chef Dave!

28:03.850 --> 28:06.019
This sh-- is fire.

28:10.482 --> 28:12.484
Okay, so now that it’s,
like, midnight...

28:12.525 --> 28:14.027
Yes.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.696
We wanna turn it into, like,
as frat party as possible,

28:16.738 --> 28:18.948
since it’s Lila’s twenty-first.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.825
Sure, all right,
we’ll see what we can do.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.118
We’ll make something happen.

28:22.160 --> 28:25.330
We’re gonna go full,
like, wild mode.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.042
We’re ready.

28:32.712 --> 28:34.130
Party vibe?
I can do that.

28:34.172 --> 28:36.800
Where is the pole?

28:36.841 --> 28:38.802
-What time is it?
-Twelve o’clock.

28:38.843 --> 28:40.303
You’ll need to go to bed soon.

28:40.345 --> 28:45.141
Tash, sleep is not an option
at this point in time.

28:47.602 --> 28:48.561
Yes, sir.

28:50.438 --> 28:54.109
At my fraternity, I set
the record of number of days

28:54.150 --> 28:56.945
drunk in a row
at 69, because...

28:58.655 --> 29:00.240
I can’t actually say.

29:00.281 --> 29:02.242
My mom would kill me.

29:03.535 --> 29:04.994
That’ll work.

29:05.036 --> 29:10.291
I once sold $1,000 of my stocks
so I could pay my bar tab.

29:12.252 --> 29:17.382
Oh, we got the pole
up here and everything!

29:17.424 --> 29:18.508
Awesome!

29:18.550 --> 29:20.051
One, two, three, four...

29:20.093 --> 29:21.720
-Mom’s there, Mom’s there.
-Five, six, seven, eight.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.555
I’m going up now to
clean all that sh--.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.473
I’ll do main deck and
clean day head.

29:25.515 --> 29:27.475
Oh, wow.

29:28.935 --> 29:30.103
Yeah.

29:30.145 --> 29:31.563
Do you want a shot?

29:31.604 --> 29:32.939
I’ll do, actually,
a Tito’s-cranberry.

29:36.609 --> 29:37.819
Yeah.

29:37.861 --> 29:39.988
Ah!

29:41.281 --> 29:43.491
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

29:45.076 --> 29:46.578
-Thank you.
-You’re welcome.

29:46.619 --> 29:47.954
Thank you, good night.

29:47.996 --> 29:49.372
-Thank you.
-Good night.

29:49.414 --> 29:50.665
Have a good night’s sleep.

29:50.707 --> 29:52.083
Do you wanna turn?

29:54.502 --> 29:56.421
Storm...

29:56.463 --> 29:57.422
Storm.

29:57.464 --> 29:58.757
I used the blue one,
like always.

29:58.798 --> 30:01.134
No, we’ve got tablets, Storm.

30:01.176 --> 30:04.262
Oh, I’m ----ing
over this day.

30:04.304 --> 30:06.765
We’re doing a congo line
through the boat.

30:06.806 --> 30:08.600
These stairs are dangerous.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.435
I would love to go
in the galley.

30:10.477 --> 30:11.936
I’ve not seen that bit yet.

30:11.978 --> 30:15.148
It’s a congo line,
get in it, girl.

30:15.190 --> 30:17.442
Girl, take your mop.

30:17.484 --> 30:18.735
Is this a joke?

30:18.777 --> 30:20.195
Get in the congo line.

30:20.236 --> 30:21.613
Congo, congo, congo.

30:21.654 --> 30:23.156
Loving this right now.

30:23.198 --> 30:25.867
No, we’re going to bed.

30:25.909 --> 30:27.077
Come on, let’s go to bed.

30:27.118 --> 30:28.620
-We’re out.
-We’re out.

30:28.661 --> 30:34.167
5:30, 6:30, 7:30, 8:30, 9:30,
10:30, 11:30, 1:30...

30:34.209 --> 30:36.878
20 hours done today, no break.

30:36.920 --> 30:38.296
Oh sh--.

30:38.338 --> 30:40.048
This is my 21st hour right now.

30:40.090 --> 30:41.508
No wonder my eyeballs are red.

30:41.549 --> 30:43.385
-Do you want me to stay?
-No, go to bed.

30:43.426 --> 30:45.470
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I’m good.

30:45.512 --> 30:48.515
Oh, this is so gross
on my makeup.

30:53.520 --> 30:57.232
It’s becoming probably
obvious with Kyle down,

30:57.273 --> 30:59.359
we need extra help.

30:59.401 --> 31:03.780
But the thought of even
replacing him...

31:03.822 --> 31:05.323
is so hard.

31:24.134 --> 31:25.176
[alarm blares]

31:33.768 --> 31:36.771
The weather is good,
we’re in no danger.

31:42.652 --> 31:45.530
Do we know what time
the guests stayed up till?

31:45.572 --> 31:47.240
Do you know what time
the guests are up?

31:51.703 --> 31:53.204
Copy that.

31:53.246 --> 31:56.458
At least we can get off
the dock, thank you, God.

32:00.045 --> 32:02.672
Captain Sandy,
Captain Sandy, Tasha.

32:02.714 --> 32:04.716
<i>Would you meet me in</i>
<i>the pantry for a second?</i>

32:04.758 --> 32:06.301
<i>Coming.</i>

32:06.343 --> 32:08.511
If nothing else,
this’ll wake the guests up.

32:10.847 --> 32:12.766
I don’t think
we’re gonna have Kyle

32:12.807 --> 32:14.851
for the rest of the season now.

32:14.893 --> 32:17.312
I mean, we’re quite
short-handed as it is,

32:17.354 --> 32:20.899
and we can’t take the
lead deckhand either,

32:20.940 --> 32:23.234
because Storm needs Courtney.

32:23.276 --> 32:25.320
It’s breakfast time.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.326
Oh, you...

32:34.537 --> 32:36.081
He wants to finish the season,

32:36.122 --> 32:38.208
but at the same time,
I’m, like, but Kyle, this...

32:38.249 --> 32:40.585
it’s not even, like, a
large boat where you can be,

32:40.627 --> 32:42.212
like, you’re only laundry.

32:42.253 --> 32:44.005
Because this boat’s
not only laundry,

32:44.047 --> 32:46.716
it’s housekeeping as well, and
he can’t run around the cabins.

32:46.758 --> 32:47.967
Yeah, no. Okay.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.427
How you feeling?

32:49.469 --> 32:51.221
Oh, good, I’m just ----ing
med is eating me.

32:51.262 --> 32:54.307
-All right.
-So, I’m just... maybe...

32:54.349 --> 32:55.308
Yeah, well,
we need a stewardess.

32:55.350 --> 32:57.143
-Yeah.
-We need a...

32:57.185 --> 32:59.437
Yes, you need a third person.

33:01.606 --> 33:02.357
All right.

33:02.399 --> 33:03.817
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

33:03.858 --> 33:05.902
-Fingers crossed.
-Okay. All right, thank you.

33:05.944 --> 33:07.195
Okay.

33:08.822 --> 33:10.031
Are you waiting...

33:10.073 --> 33:11.991
Yeah, we are,
we’re just waiting for him.

33:12.033 --> 33:15.161
<i>Storm, I’m gonna be on the</i>
<i>starboard side wing station.</i>

33:15.203 --> 33:17.622
Copy, Captain, copy.

33:17.664 --> 33:19.916
<i>Go ahead and free all</i>
<i>lines back there, Storm.</i>

33:19.958 --> 33:21.376
<i>Just free them all.</i>

33:21.418 --> 33:24.045
<i>Copy that, Captain,</i>
<i>freeing stern lines.</i>

33:24.087 --> 33:25.338
-Got it, Courts?
-Yeah.

33:25.380 --> 33:26.673
Port bow is coming off.

33:26.715 --> 33:29.509
-Release the starboard.
-Yes, ma’am.

33:32.095 --> 33:36.683
Three meters, three meters to
V4 on your port midship.

33:36.725 --> 33:38.852
Let me know when
it’s clear to swing.

33:38.893 --> 33:40.311
You are clear to swing.

33:41.938 --> 33:43.690
It’s gonna be a little bumpy,
but that’s okay.

33:43.732 --> 33:45.734
At least we’re off the dock.

33:48.194 --> 33:50.530
Nice job, dude, thank you.

33:50.572 --> 33:52.198
How many fenders are
we gonna need?

33:52.240 --> 33:53.408
I need like three.

33:54.242 --> 33:55.326
-Whoa.
-Ah!

33:55.368 --> 33:57.203
Help me cover?

33:57.245 --> 33:59.789
Okay, the plan is when
we get there,

33:59.831 --> 34:02.500
we’re gonna put skis in
the water immediately.

34:02.542 --> 34:03.960
I’m gonna start getting
them to start

34:04.002 --> 34:05.170
setting up toys in the aft.

34:05.211 --> 34:07.380
-Okay.
-Ah!

34:07.422 --> 34:11.092
And then I’m gonna hook the
slide up straightaway, dude,

34:11.134 --> 34:12.385
because it’s ----ing 9:00, hey?

34:12.427 --> 34:13.720
Like, they’re leaving
in three hours.

34:13.762 --> 34:15.597
-Yeah.
-We don’t have a lot of time.

34:15.638 --> 34:17.182
Guests wanna go in the
water now,

34:17.223 --> 34:18.725
and every minute that
they don’t go in the water

34:18.767 --> 34:20.560
is gonna feel like
10 minutes to them.

34:20.602 --> 34:23.396
So, we need to really
get everything out

34:23.438 --> 34:24.481
as soon as possible.

34:24.522 --> 34:27.650
We’re off the dock, woohoo!

34:27.692 --> 34:28.985
We’re off the dock!

34:29.027 --> 34:29.944
We made it.

34:35.325 --> 34:36.326
So happy.

34:36.368 --> 34:37.660
How are they all for coffees?

34:37.702 --> 34:38.578
Okay...

34:38.620 --> 34:40.205
Wait, where’d the Nespresso go?

34:40.246 --> 34:42.040
I had to put it on the floor,
it’s there in the galley.

34:42.082 --> 34:43.541
<i>All right, Captain,</i>
<i>anchor is ready to drop.</i>

34:43.583 --> 34:45.418
<i>How many shackles</i>
<i>would you like?</i>

34:45.460 --> 34:47.295
<i>We’re gonna go three</i>
<i>in the water...</i>

34:47.337 --> 34:48.463
<i>anchor down, anchor down.</i>

34:50.382 --> 34:51.925
That’s three on the waterline.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.259
We’re in, baby.

34:53.301 --> 34:55.053
-Sandy!
-Woo!

34:55.095 --> 34:56.054
Yeah!

34:56.096 --> 34:57.097
[cheering]

34:57.138 --> 34:58.473
Yeah, we made it.

34:58.515 --> 35:00.183
-Yay, good job!
-Just gotta trust the captain.

35:00.225 --> 35:02.268
No, it’s good... they’re gonna
put everything out.

35:02.310 --> 35:04.270
-Can’t wait.
-Oh, my gosh.

35:04.312 --> 35:05.605
<i>Reid and Courts,</i>
<i>Reid and Courts,</i>

35:05.647 --> 35:06.940
<i>can I get you to</i>
<i>the bow, please?</i>

35:06.981 --> 35:09.609
Yeah, just tying off
the NautiBuoy, two secs.

35:09.651 --> 35:10.944
Reminds me of when
we were on our cruise

35:10.985 --> 35:12.362
a couple of years ago.

35:12.404 --> 35:14.781
<i>Natalya, Tash, can you just</i>
<i>give me a hand</i>

35:14.823 --> 35:17.534
<i>bringing the buffet</i>
<i>out to the table?</i>

35:17.575 --> 35:19.869
-Copy.
-Sh--.

35:19.911 --> 35:21.204
Okay, guys, two minutes.

35:21.246 --> 35:22.956
Copy.

35:22.997 --> 35:24.874
We’re putting both in,
aren’t we?

35:24.916 --> 35:26.626
-Yeah.
-Go, Mzi!

35:26.668 --> 35:29.295
I never wanna see
the dock again.

35:29.337 --> 35:31.297
Me neither.

35:31.339 --> 35:32.799
Love that noise.

35:36.886 --> 35:39.055
Everyone’s gonna go
down the slide today.

35:42.225 --> 35:44.477
You know what,
we’re out here till 2:00 p.m.

35:44.519 --> 35:45.979
We are so happy.

35:46.021 --> 35:48.565
-Oh, God, let’s get going.
-Yeah.

35:48.606 --> 35:50.066
All right, let’s
jump off this boat.

35:53.361 --> 35:55.989
What’s your preference, you
want me to just dump and run,

35:56.031 --> 35:57.282
and then you...

35:57.323 --> 35:58.867
Yeah, you can do that.

35:58.908 --> 36:00.410
Okay, so who’s wanting
to jump off?

36:00.452 --> 36:02.829
Three, two, one, go!

36:02.871 --> 36:04.122
[whistling]

36:04.164 --> 36:06.166
That was a 10 out of 10!

36:06.207 --> 36:07.417
-Those can fly.
-Yeah?

36:07.459 --> 36:09.002
That is a flying one.

36:09.044 --> 36:10.128
See you later.

36:11.212 --> 36:12.297
Have fun!

36:12.339 --> 36:14.049
We’re trying the damndest...

36:16.885 --> 36:18.928
We’re gonna try to make
the most out of this.

36:21.139 --> 36:23.141
Woo-hoo!

36:23.183 --> 36:24.476
Woo!

36:29.481 --> 36:31.608
The exhaustion is,
like, setting in.

36:33.818 --> 36:36.363
I can even see Natalya is
started to get exhausted,

36:36.404 --> 36:38.114
and she’s like a ball of energy.

36:40.784 --> 36:42.869
-That was crazy.
-Whew!

36:42.911 --> 36:44.704
Yeah, that was fun,
that was a blast.

36:44.746 --> 36:45.872
Oh, I feel like--

36:45.914 --> 36:47.415
The hydroboard thing was
my favorite.

36:47.457 --> 36:48.875
All right, I’m gonna go pack.

36:48.917 --> 36:51.670
-Yeah, okay.
-I’ll go pack.

36:51.711 --> 36:52.879
-Storm, Storm.
-I’m right here.

36:52.921 --> 36:54.047
Oh.

36:57.092 --> 36:58.802
Yeah, I’ll go get it
from the...

36:58.843 --> 37:00.595
Tonight we’ll make a tea,
watch a movie in bed,

37:00.637 --> 37:01.805
and have a cuddle, okay?

37:01.846 --> 37:03.223
Tonight...

37:03.264 --> 37:04.683
I thought you were gonna say,
"Tonight, we make love."

37:04.724 --> 37:06.059
And I... well, I mean,
we can if you want,

37:06.101 --> 37:07.602
but I’ll give you a
full massage, okay?

37:10.980 --> 37:13.024
I should just throw
everything in here.

38:06.327 --> 38:08.163
The pain that
I feel in my heart is worse

38:08.204 --> 38:09.914
than what I feel in my foot.

38:09.956 --> 38:13.293
I respect her decision,
and I don’t wanna leave them

38:13.335 --> 38:17.088
in this part where they might
be struggling a bit more.

38:29.726 --> 38:30.810
All crew, all crew,
get into your whites,

38:32.103 --> 38:34.522
we have five minutes
to guest departure.

38:34.564 --> 38:35.774
Ow.

38:35.815 --> 38:38.610
Isaac?
You gotta hurry up.

38:38.651 --> 38:40.362
Where’s the straw bag, guys?

38:40.403 --> 38:41.696
Let’s go.

38:41.738 --> 38:42.864
Thank you, guys.

38:42.906 --> 38:44.324
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

38:44.366 --> 38:46.284
So nice to meet you.

38:46.326 --> 38:47.869
Oh, my God.

38:47.911 --> 38:49.204
All right, bring it in,
bring it in.

38:49.245 --> 38:50.330
Of course.

38:50.372 --> 38:52.207
You were so awesome,
thank you so much.

38:52.248 --> 38:53.917
Thanks for everything,
the food was delicious.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.710
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much, Sandy.

38:55.752 --> 38:57.170
Yeah, you, too.

38:57.212 --> 38:58.046
You run a great ship...

38:58.088 --> 38:59.464
-Thanks.
-You do a great job.

38:59.506 --> 39:01.299
Thank you so
much for everything,

39:01.341 --> 39:02.884
and everybody did a great job.

39:02.926 --> 39:04.177
-Awesome.
-We appreciate everyone.

39:04.219 --> 39:08.056
-Thank you, guys.
-Thank you so much.

39:08.098 --> 39:08.973
Bye!

39:09.015 --> 39:11.184
-Bye, guys, thank you!
-Adios!

39:11.226 --> 39:12.477
All right, we got
a tight turnaround.

39:12.519 --> 39:13.853
Let’s meet in the main salon

39:13.895 --> 39:15.271
for this very
skinny envelope tip meeting.

39:15.313 --> 39:17.399
-Woo!
-Woo!

39:17.440 --> 39:18.900
Woo-hoo!

39:18.942 --> 39:21.611
I thought they were
gonna say something negative,

39:21.653 --> 39:23.613
but they didn’t.

39:23.655 --> 39:26.908
-Oi!
-Oh, tragic.

39:26.950 --> 39:28.576
I’m so tired of working,

39:28.618 --> 39:33.498
I can’t imagine how you guys
look so rested, honestly.

39:33.540 --> 39:36.334
Let’s get this started, because
we got a boat to turn around.

39:36.376 --> 39:40.046
Okay, so being stuck
at the dock sucked...

39:40.088 --> 39:42.924
for us, and you
guys worked so hard.

39:42.966 --> 39:44.759
Nice work...
teamwork makes the dream work.

39:44.801 --> 39:46.261
Yeah, thanks...
yeah, it was the teamwork.

39:46.302 --> 39:49.180
Kyle, your fall...

39:49.222 --> 39:52.559
thank God this is all
that happened, you know?

39:52.600 --> 39:56.271
Thank you so much, Captain,
and especially to my two girls,

39:56.312 --> 39:58.064
who ran immediately
to my assistance.

39:58.106 --> 40:00.066
So, I really appreciate it
from the bottom of my heart.

40:00.108 --> 40:02.485
So, Kyle’s gonna
leave us today,

40:02.527 --> 40:04.654
and we’re taking on a stewardess

40:04.696 --> 40:07.115
so we can get through
this charter.

40:07.157 --> 40:09.117
So, we gotta fill in
for Kyle while he’s hurt.

40:09.159 --> 40:11.369
He is not fired,
he’s just going ashore

40:11.411 --> 40:13.955
because I do not have an extra
bunk for him to sleep in.

40:13.997 --> 40:15.665
Right, he’s part
of a team, okay?

40:15.707 --> 40:16.958
Yeah.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.961
Here, we have $18,000...

40:20.003 --> 40:24.466
14,200 euros,
$1,600 per person.

40:24.507 --> 40:25.800
Woo!

40:25.842 --> 40:28.136
Yeah, well done, everyone.

40:28.178 --> 40:29.971
So, thank you.

40:30.013 --> 40:32.057
Holy sh--, I thought
we were gonna get,

40:32.098 --> 40:34.267
like, the most minimum
minimum of the minimum.

40:34.309 --> 40:35.977
Stuck on a dock
most of the time,

40:36.019 --> 40:37.771
I would have been happy
with a high-five.

40:39.939 --> 40:42.567
Everybody did
a great job, thank you.

40:42.609 --> 40:43.818
Thank you so much.

40:43.860 --> 40:45.111
Is anybody going out tonight?

40:45.153 --> 40:46.738
Is everyone...
you’re tired.

40:46.780 --> 40:47.822
I’m not tired.

40:47.864 --> 40:49.657
-No...
-No, I’m great.

40:49.699 --> 40:51.743
Yeah. I hurt.

40:51.785 --> 40:53.119
We need to start
turning the boat around.

41:03.254 --> 41:05.924
Whew.

41:05.965 --> 41:07.592
There’s a totebag
in the laundry full of, like,

41:07.634 --> 41:09.177
napkins ready to,
like, send off.

41:09.219 --> 41:11.388
And then there’s four of
these in the vacuum cupboard.

41:11.429 --> 41:13.223
-Okay, cool.
-I’ll make this up now.

41:13.264 --> 41:16.017
-I’ll get all the laundry out.
-Thank you.

41:16.059 --> 41:17.811
I’ll make the beddies.

41:19.521 --> 41:24.025
All season I’ve had to deal
with Natalya disrespecting me,

41:24.067 --> 41:28.321
Dave constantly
having issues with me,

41:28.363 --> 41:33.785
and Kyle has been there as my
rock, as my emotional support.

41:33.827 --> 41:37.038
And to lose that feels like

41:37.080 --> 41:41.876
I don’t know how
I’m gonna cope the next trip.

41:41.918 --> 41:43.712
Kyle, do you need a hand,
help with anything?

41:43.753 --> 41:46.214
I’ve got the bags
already packed.

41:46.256 --> 41:48.133
Don’t forget, like, coffee
and stuff as well, Kyle.

41:48.174 --> 41:49.426
Sure.

41:49.467 --> 41:51.344
----ing hell, he’s not
going to the desert.

41:51.386 --> 41:53.221
[laughing]

41:53.263 --> 41:56.933
<i>Natasha, Natasha,</i>
<i>I’m about to head off soon.</i>

41:56.975 --> 41:58.309
Copy, I’m coming.

42:00.395 --> 42:02.439
Ah.

42:02.480 --> 42:06.651
The paddleboard’s going
in the tender bay.

42:06.693 --> 42:08.653
Blow it up, ready for tomorrow.

42:08.695 --> 42:11.823
-Sure.
-Mi amor.

42:11.865 --> 42:13.158
Hello.

42:13.199 --> 42:14.034
Oh, wow...

42:14.075 --> 42:15.368
Nat, you look super rested.

42:15.410 --> 42:16.828
Yeah.

42:16.870 --> 42:19.706
Honestly, I’ve never seen
you look so fresh before.

42:19.748 --> 42:22.375
Goodbye.

42:22.417 --> 42:24.919
Oh, Kyle.

42:26.129 --> 42:27.464
I’m so tired.

42:27.505 --> 42:29.090
I know you are,
what are you thinking?

42:29.132 --> 42:30.925
I think that it’s too,
you know...

42:30.967 --> 42:32.302
She’s too much energy.

42:32.344 --> 42:35.430
I think she needed
to burn a bit out.

42:35.472 --> 42:38.099
To say goodbye to Tash
is one of the most

42:38.141 --> 42:40.101
difficult moments for me
that I’ve had.

42:40.143 --> 42:41.436
-I’ll see you soon.
-Okay, bye, Kyle.

42:41.478 --> 42:42.354
Bye, honey.

42:42.395 --> 42:43.813
I’ll send you guys some love.

42:43.855 --> 42:45.482
She’s literally my best friend.

42:50.612 --> 42:52.530
This person was your neighbor,
you know,

42:52.572 --> 42:55.533
and now you’re worlds apart
from each other.

42:55.575 --> 42:57.494
And I genuinely hope we can keep
this friendship going

42:57.535 --> 42:59.287
no matter where
we are in this world.

42:59.329 --> 43:00.330
-Here we are.
-Bye, take care.

43:00.372 --> 43:02.040
-Thank you.
-Bye, Kyle!

43:02.082 --> 43:03.792
-Bye, Kyle!
-Love you guys.

43:03.833 --> 43:05.293
-See you later.
-See you later.

43:05.335 --> 43:07.212
Get the beers ice cold,
I’m coming in strong.

43:07.253 --> 43:09.547
I’m gonna be walking
after this, trust me.

43:09.589 --> 43:11.299
Be careful, mate.

43:11.341 --> 43:12.342
[sniffles]

43:16.471 --> 43:18.223
Oh, I have a lot on
my face right now.

43:20.058 --> 43:22.060
Which eye is left?

43:28.108 --> 43:29.484
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:32.654 --> 43:33.822
-Hi!
-Hi!

43:33.863 --> 43:35.657
-High heels?
-Look at your toenails.

43:35.699 --> 43:37.283
Final charter.

43:37.325 --> 43:39.411
They’re looking to treat
the company’s business partners

43:39.452 --> 43:41.079
and NFL players.

43:41.955 --> 43:44.791
-Ooh!
-Oh!

43:44.833 --> 43:47.127
I lost my chain.

43:48.712 --> 43:50.005
Oh sh--.

43:50.046 --> 43:51.673
-I would like some pancakes.
-For dinner?

43:51.715 --> 43:52.716
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

43:52.757 --> 43:53.842
I’m not eating that sh--.

43:53.883 --> 43:54.843
I did not ask for crepes.

43:54.884 --> 43:56.511
I specifically said "pancakes."

43:56.553 --> 43:58.847
Come on, man.

43:58.888 --> 44:02.976
I’m so pissed off, Tash’s
ex calling me a bully.

44:03.018 --> 44:04.686
How do you want me to deal
with this situation?

44:04.728 --> 44:07.105
I don’t, I want you to know
it’s absolutely bullsh--.

44:07.147 --> 44:10.442
All I wanna do is ----ing
break this guy’s neck.
