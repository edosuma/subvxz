<i>Previously on</i> House of Lies:

00:08.899 --> 00:11.180
<i> I can't really get over</i>
<i>everything that's happened.</i>

00:11.201 --> 00:12.400
<i>We need to just get through</i>

00:12.452 --> 00:13.618
this transition,

00:13.654 --> 00:16.288
and then you should
leave for good.

00:16.323 --> 00:18.540
I have an idea for an app.
It's basically Uber,

00:18.575 --> 00:19.791
but with doctors.
With doctors.

00:19.826 --> 00:21.042
Kind of brilliant, Kelse.

00:21.078 --> 00:23.295
Get up and fuck
your ovulating wife.

00:23.330 --> 00:25.413
Use the Fuck Force.

00:25.465 --> 00:27.249
Cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.

00:27.301 --> 00:28.862
It's time for Doug
to take care of Doug.

00:28.886 --> 00:30.502
Did you mean to say, uh,

00:30.554 --> 00:32.003
"Yo, girl, you're one
crazy country"?

00:32.055 --> 00:34.139
We should "F" Doug

00:34.174 --> 00:35.307
<i>in his "A."</i>

00:35.342 --> 00:36.508
My money.

00:37.644 --> 00:39.427
Sarah!

00:40.597 --> 00:41.930
Oh, my God.

00:41.982 --> 00:44.733
<i> Our boy,</i>
<i>Ellis Gage Hightower,</i>

00:44.768 --> 00:46.818
<i>godhead of electric cars.</i>

00:46.853 --> 00:48.353
<i>This piece of business</i>
<i>is our ticket</i>

00:48.405 --> 00:49.821
out of the shit shed.

00:49.856 --> 00:51.489
<i> You still</i>
<i>stubbornly insist on being</i>

00:51.525 --> 00:53.742
Ellis Hightower's
slobbery lapdog?

00:53.777 --> 00:55.410
Is Dante Valerio trying
to push me out?

00:55.445 --> 00:58.663
After I told you
that I am carrying your baby,

00:58.699 --> 01:01.158
I can't believe
that you have no reaction.

01:01.418 --> 01:03.230
This is my reaction.

01:10.844 --> 01:12.794
Aha! What'd you think?

01:12.846 --> 01:13.962
Illuminating.
Good, good, good.

01:14.014 --> 01:15.180
Yeah, unforgettable.

01:15.215 --> 01:16.548
Thrill ride of the summer.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.800
If you only read one
business plan this year,

01:18.852 --> 01:20.468
make it "Cost Analysis,

01:20.520 --> 01:22.437
"Marketing Orientation
and Profitability Objectives

01:22.472 --> 01:24.189
for a GPS-Based Physician..."

01:24.224 --> 01:25.890
Okay, you can stop.
So you didn't even read it.

01:25.943 --> 01:27.442
No, I did not read it.
Because...?

01:27.477 --> 01:30.312
Because business plans
are just pages and pages

01:30.314 --> 01:31.980
of pseudoscience with the
actual predictive power

01:31.982 --> 01:33.698
of a random number generator.

01:33.734 --> 01:35.533
I know they're necessary
to draw in money people,

01:35.569 --> 01:36.618
because money people are stupid,

01:36.653 --> 01:37.953
but they're total bullshit.

01:37.988 --> 01:39.237
It's a good thing
I didn't choose a career

01:39.289 --> 01:40.238
where that's
pretty much all I do.

01:40.290 --> 01:42.824
Hey, Kelse! Check this shit out.

01:42.876 --> 01:45.961
Your boss wants you
to check that shit out.

01:50.634 --> 01:52.417
Dude, right behind you,
there's a bee.

01:58.892 --> 01:59.924
No, that was a woman.

01:59.977 --> 02:01.426
I thought it was
a really big bee.

02:01.478 --> 02:03.595
I'm allergic.

02:03.647 --> 02:06.564
So, how's your day job going?

02:06.600 --> 02:08.015
We'd better fucking
make this work.

02:08.018 --> 02:09.317
Yeah. I'm gonna work...

02:09.353 --> 02:10.852
I need you to babysit

02:10.904 --> 02:13.071
that useless
PR woman Ellis hired.

02:13.106 --> 02:15.407
We can't afford any hiccups
at the town hall today.

02:15.442 --> 02:17.692
Well, we can always just
overwhelm the vagus nerve

02:17.744 --> 02:19.160
with another sensation.

02:19.196 --> 02:21.780
That's how you cure
actual hiccups, so...

02:21.832 --> 02:23.198
Little Doug fact.

02:23.250 --> 02:24.532
Just keep an eye out.

02:24.534 --> 02:26.584
I should be to Gage by 1:00.

02:26.620 --> 02:28.003
By 1:00? What, you're
not flying up with us?

02:28.038 --> 02:29.954
No, I have a thing this morning.

02:30.007 --> 02:31.840
Okay. What do you mean,
you have a thing?

02:31.875 --> 02:33.174
I mean I have a thing.

02:33.210 --> 02:34.342
Okay. What thing?

02:34.378 --> 02:36.544
I'm strapping on a dildo
and fucking your mom.

02:36.596 --> 02:38.930
I don't see how this
is any of your business.

02:38.965 --> 02:40.765
It's Ellis' first day back
after prison.

02:40.801 --> 02:42.934
Gage is preparing to roll
out the new model today.

02:42.969 --> 02:44.436
We're only at the
most critical juncture

02:44.471 --> 02:46.471
on our most important consult.

02:46.523 --> 02:48.056
But no, no,
no-- go ahead.

02:48.108 --> 02:49.724
You, uh, enjoy your tennis game.

02:49.776 --> 02:51.276
Yep, 'cause that's
what I'm doing.

02:51.311 --> 02:52.394
I'm playing tennis.

02:52.446 --> 02:54.312
What were you
and Marty smoking

02:54.364 --> 02:57.232
when you decided to put so
many eggs in one basket?

02:57.284 --> 03:00.068
With smaller clients and
shorter gigs, we'd be seeing

03:00.120 --> 03:01.286
more fees sooner...

03:01.321 --> 03:03.822
First of all,
it was Marty who...

03:05.492 --> 03:07.709
Gesundheit.

03:07.744 --> 03:09.961
Fuck.

03:11.248 --> 03:13.214
See, if I'd have known
that was the strategy,

03:13.250 --> 03:16.835
I'd have never... have agreed
to defer so much salary

03:16.887 --> 03:18.920
while K and A... Oh, my
God, what's happening?

03:18.972 --> 03:20.839
I peed myself, Doug.
What?

03:20.891 --> 03:23.007
That's what's happening.
Thanks, pregnancy.

03:23.060 --> 03:25.760
Look...

03:25.812 --> 03:28.897
Dumpster diving isn't gonna
make K and A a player again,

03:28.932 --> 03:31.433
but if we kick ass at Gage,

03:31.485 --> 03:33.485
then the future is nothing

03:33.520 --> 03:36.020
but lollipops
and rainbows, okay?

03:36.073 --> 03:37.105
Doug?

03:37.157 --> 03:38.323
What's that?

03:38.358 --> 03:39.774
Really?
Really what?

03:39.826 --> 03:41.826
My pee-soaked underpants
intrigue you?

03:41.862 --> 03:43.495
No. No!

03:43.530 --> 03:46.164
Why were you just lost in
some sort of fucked-up reverie?

03:46.199 --> 03:47.866
What? No, I wasn't... I was not.

03:47.918 --> 03:49.834
Excuse me. I just wasn't
interested in listening

03:49.870 --> 03:51.503
to your bullshit
rationalization right now.

03:51.538 --> 03:54.923
Speaking of which, I would like
all the salary I deferred

03:54.958 --> 03:56.091
right now.
Okay.

03:56.126 --> 03:57.959
Hey, Marty, Doug
wants us to pay him

03:58.011 --> 03:59.928
his entire deferred
salary right now today.

03:59.963 --> 04:01.346
That's nice.

04:01.381 --> 04:03.548
So your boy,
Ellis Hightower, called me

04:03.600 --> 04:05.133
at 3:30 in the morning.

04:05.185 --> 04:07.435
He was on his way in
to the Gage offices.

04:07.471 --> 04:08.553
On foot.

04:08.605 --> 04:09.971
Doesn't he lives in Tiburon?

04:09.973 --> 04:11.606
Isn't that like 20 miles?

04:11.641 --> 04:13.558
I'm so glad we tied our
future to this guy.

04:14.528 --> 04:15.810
I mean-- wait--

04:15.862 --> 04:18.396
I'm so glad we tied
our future to this guy.

04:18.447 --> 04:19.447
All right, let's get going.

04:19.483 --> 04:20.982
Okay. I'm not, um...

04:20.983 --> 04:23.451
Remember, I'm... I don't fly up
till this afternoon.

04:23.487 --> 04:24.536
Oh, yeah, right.

04:24.571 --> 04:26.287
She's got a thing this morning.

04:26.323 --> 04:28.790
Something you don't need
underpants for, apparently.

04:28.825 --> 04:30.542
Give us a minute, Doug.

04:30.577 --> 04:32.494
Sure. Yeah.

04:34.247 --> 04:35.630
Are you really not...?

04:35.665 --> 04:36.798
No.
Oh.

04:36.833 --> 04:39.000
Our baby is toying
with my bladder.

04:43.056 --> 04:44.806
What, did you want to...?

04:44.841 --> 04:46.674
Just, with today
being the big day,

04:46.676 --> 04:48.843
and Ellis being Ellis,

04:48.895 --> 04:51.513
and his dÃ©tente
with the board still fragile,

04:51.565 --> 04:55.016
I thought I can cancel this
meeting with the headhunter.

04:55.068 --> 04:56.935
Only because... you know,
she's a good friend,

04:56.987 --> 04:58.019
I can reschedule.

04:58.071 --> 04:59.487
Oh, no, I...
I got that covered.

04:59.523 --> 05:00.905
You don't have to worry
about that.

05:00.941 --> 05:02.490
We're good.
Okay. No, great.

05:02.526 --> 05:05.109
Great. Then I'll see
you this afternoon.

05:05.162 --> 05:06.528
Okay.

05:06.530 --> 05:08.530
Oh, hey, uh, before
your meeting,

05:08.582 --> 05:10.498
you might want to
purchase a pair of...

05:10.534 --> 05:11.833
Yeah, I got it covered.

05:11.868 --> 05:13.034
Okay, yeah,
that's what I'm saying.

05:13.086 --> 05:14.502
You might want
to get it covered.

05:14.538 --> 05:15.703
No, I'll... I'm gonna cover it.

05:15.755 --> 05:17.088
I'm not gonna not wear...

05:19.960 --> 05:21.593
And what we've accomplished
thus far

05:21.628 --> 05:23.378
is nothing short of a miracle.

05:23.380 --> 05:25.547
And so now
we are once again poised

05:25.599 --> 05:28.716
to change the course
of human history.

05:29.936 --> 05:32.387
Yes! That's right!

05:32.439 --> 05:33.972
Wow.
You know what I think

05:34.024 --> 05:35.890
I like the most about your boy?
Hmm?

05:35.942 --> 05:37.442
Is his humility.

05:37.477 --> 05:39.110
For me, it's
little-boy haircut,

05:39.145 --> 05:40.445
then humility.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.864
Okay, say what you want,
but he has got these people

05:42.899 --> 05:44.148
in the palm of his hands.

05:44.201 --> 05:46.150
And look at the way
he commands their attention.

05:46.203 --> 05:48.152
It's almost Hitleresque.

05:48.205 --> 05:49.885
- You back there...
- I wonder how Ellis

05:49.906 --> 05:51.739
matches up when it comes
to world domination

05:51.791 --> 05:52.824
and Jew killing.

05:52.876 --> 05:53.992
Jew killing.

05:54.044 --> 05:55.660
Now, God rested
on the seventh day,

05:55.712 --> 05:57.912
but we do not have that luxury.

05:57.964 --> 06:00.164
We have a mission to fulfill.

06:00.217 --> 06:02.133
So now I say
let's get back to work

06:02.168 --> 06:04.219
and fulfill the Gage destiny.
Let's do it!

06:05.422 --> 06:06.471
Wow.

06:06.506 --> 06:08.840
Did he just take God down
for being lazy?

06:08.892 --> 06:10.341
Wow. Even Adolf Hitler

06:10.393 --> 06:11.759
never sucker-punched
the big guy, right?

06:11.811 --> 06:12.927
No, what I was saying

06:12.979 --> 06:14.429
is that Hitler
had a compelling presence.

06:14.431 --> 06:16.014
I'm... Back me up, Marty.
Come on.

06:16.066 --> 06:17.732
Oh, yeah. I love Hitler.
That's my nigga.

06:17.767 --> 06:19.350
You can't say it.

06:19.402 --> 06:21.236
- I want to.
- I know. You can't.

06:26.610 --> 06:27.775
Hey, Monica.

06:27.827 --> 06:28.943
Oh, hey.

06:28.995 --> 06:30.955
You know, every time
I turn around, there you are?

06:30.997 --> 06:32.330
I mean, I'm flattered, but...

06:32.365 --> 06:33.748
That's funny, 'cause I
feel like my teachers

06:33.783 --> 06:35.283
told me that the world
revolved around the sun.

06:36.503 --> 06:37.869
Public schools.
Yeah.

06:37.921 --> 06:39.120
Idiots.

06:39.172 --> 06:40.622
I'm actually here

06:40.624 --> 06:42.924
representing my
firm's interests.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.459
Oh, you forgot?

06:44.511 --> 06:45.760
Chairman of the
board is a client.

06:45.795 --> 06:47.178
What? Sinatra?

06:47.213 --> 06:50.431
Yeah.
What a get for Demark, huh?

06:50.467 --> 06:52.267
Oh...

06:52.302 --> 06:53.935
Marty, you remember
Dante Valerio.

06:53.970 --> 06:55.219
Ring-a-ding-ding.

06:55.272 --> 06:57.805
I'll be at the hotel
if something comes up.

06:57.807 --> 06:59.357
Okay.

07:00.977 --> 07:03.311
And the snake slithers away.

07:03.313 --> 07:05.280
A little paternal advice:

07:05.315 --> 07:07.649
after you've chased
everyone off,

07:07.651 --> 07:11.486
there's no one else to
blame if things go south.

07:11.488 --> 07:13.071
Good luck today.

07:15.492 --> 07:16.824
All right.

07:16.876 --> 07:19.127
Who wants to go take a look
into the fucking future?

07:19.162 --> 07:20.128
Uh...
Wait a minute.

07:20.163 --> 07:21.323
Are you talking about the car?

07:21.331 --> 07:22.664
Because I wouldn't
put it past you

07:22.666 --> 07:23.998
to have built a time machine.
Ah.

07:24.050 --> 07:25.750
I wouldn't, either.

07:25.802 --> 07:27.635
- It's possible.
- Yes.

07:28.555 --> 07:30.171
Well...

07:32.642 --> 07:33.891
You should come.

07:36.313 --> 07:37.679
Sounds like a hoot.

07:37.731 --> 07:39.480
Great. Let's go.

07:39.516 --> 07:41.065
Gentlemen?
Yes. All right.

07:41.101 --> 07:42.517
<i>So, this car of yours,</i>

07:42.569 --> 07:44.018
does it have a backseat?

07:44.020 --> 07:45.903
It's really intended as
a two-person vehicle.

07:45.939 --> 07:47.405
The rear compartment's
pretty tight.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.857
Oh. Well, the best
rear compartments usually are.

07:49.909 --> 07:51.943
Doesn't mean
you can't squeeze in.

07:53.780 --> 07:55.697
Okay, there she is.

07:55.749 --> 07:57.081
Let's take a look.

07:57.117 --> 07:58.249
Yes.
Let's do it.

07:58.284 --> 08:00.084
Can I talk to you?
Stop it.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.586
Monica, Monica.
What?

08:01.621 --> 08:03.504
What...what are you doing?

08:03.540 --> 08:05.423
Oh, don't worry.
I'm not going to fuck Ellis.

08:05.458 --> 08:07.125
I know he's your
special friend from prison.

08:07.177 --> 08:08.676
I think you should,

08:08.712 --> 08:10.112
'cause that's the
only shot you got.

08:10.130 --> 08:12.547
Is it? Is there going to be
press at the town hall?

08:12.599 --> 08:14.882
Because Dante has been in
such a chatty mood lately.

08:14.934 --> 08:16.517
The war is over.
Your guy lost.

08:17.687 --> 08:20.271
"I question whether
Ellis Hightower possesses

08:20.306 --> 08:22.473
"the proper skill set
and temperament

08:22.525 --> 08:24.225
"for the future of Gage
as we move

08:24.277 --> 08:25.797
into this next stage
of our evolution."

08:25.812 --> 08:27.362
Is that your Dante Valerio?

08:27.397 --> 08:28.780
Oh, do you think
that that's gonna

08:28.815 --> 08:30.231
cause unrest among shareholders?

08:30.283 --> 08:32.734
Because I... I think
he could dial it up a notch.

08:32.785 --> 08:34.652
What does Dante want exactly?

08:34.703 --> 08:36.320
Ellis gone.
That it?

08:36.373 --> 08:37.655
But he would settle

08:37.707 --> 08:39.374
for a three-year renewal
on his chairmanship

08:39.409 --> 08:41.458
and acknowledgment
at the town hall

08:41.494 --> 08:43.378
of the huge role he played
in Gage's success.

08:43.413 --> 08:44.495
Oh, that's very generous,

08:44.547 --> 08:46.414
but none of that shit's
going to happen.

08:46.466 --> 08:49.550
Here's what I can do for you:
Gage sun visor and a key chain.

08:49.586 --> 08:50.802
No way.
Yep.

08:50.837 --> 08:52.253
I'll take it--and fuck yourself.
Great.

08:52.305 --> 08:53.588
Hey, come... listen,
listen, listen.

08:53.590 --> 08:54.922
How badly does Dante want

08:54.974 --> 08:56.808
to be on the wrong
side of history?

08:56.843 --> 08:58.593
Because, if he comes out
publicly against Ellis,

08:58.645 --> 09:00.144
all of that cred he's built up

09:00.180 --> 09:02.146
for the last three
decades as being

09:02.182 --> 09:04.816
a fucking thought leader
in technology-- bye-bye.

09:04.851 --> 09:07.235
Oh, no.
You and I both know that this car

09:07.270 --> 09:09.437
is going to be met with
a social media tsunami.

09:09.489 --> 09:11.572
What the fuck is that?!
So here's what you need to do.

09:11.608 --> 09:13.008
I thought we fucking
discussed this!

09:13.026 --> 09:14.942
What the fuck is that?
Go tell your boy to bite his tongue,

09:14.994 --> 09:16.944
or he's going to look
like a fucking idiot.

09:18.865 --> 09:21.199
I think he's going to look
like a fucking genius.

09:21.251 --> 09:23.000
Want to know what I think
of your fucking work?

09:23.036 --> 09:24.285
Ellis, Ellis, Ellis.
Exactly what I fucking think?

09:24.337 --> 09:25.920
Stop, man, what are you doing?
Mr. Hightower...

09:25.955 --> 09:28.005
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no. No!

09:29.626 --> 09:30.792
What is wrong with you?

09:30.844 --> 09:32.043
It's bigger than I thought.

09:32.095 --> 09:33.127
- There's your bonus.
- Fuck, Ellis.

09:33.179 --> 09:36.013
Don't you fucking say
my name, I'm peeing.

09:36.049 --> 09:37.548
That's okay, it's just a little
urine-- that'll come right out.

09:37.600 --> 09:39.884
Idiot.

09:39.936 --> 09:41.719
Do we have another
one of these or...?

09:41.771 --> 09:43.304
Hey, Ellis...
Think about what you're doing!

09:43.356 --> 09:45.106
I know exactly what I'm doing.
What the fuck? No, no...

09:45.141 --> 09:46.891
Fuck!

09:46.943 --> 09:48.309
Easy!

09:50.230 --> 09:51.979
No! Okay.

09:52.031 --> 09:53.981
Whoa!
Oh, God.

09:55.368 --> 09:56.784
Fix that.

09:56.820 --> 09:57.952
You could fix that.

09:57.987 --> 09:58.953
Oh, it's so good.

09:58.988 --> 10:00.204
How are you gonna fix that?

10:03.543 --> 10:05.827
Absolutely, I will, thanks.

10:07.497 --> 10:09.964
Erin, it's so good to see you.

10:09.999 --> 10:11.249
It's good to see you...

10:11.301 --> 10:13.084
are having a baby.

10:13.136 --> 10:14.886
Hopefully not right this minute.

10:14.921 --> 10:17.672
So, like I said
in my e-mail,

10:17.724 --> 10:21.058
I'm just exploring
the idea of making a change.

10:21.094 --> 10:23.394
With K and A emerging
from the ashes,

10:23.429 --> 10:26.430
I feel like now would be a good
time to see what's out there.

10:26.483 --> 10:28.516
Huh.

10:28.568 --> 10:29.767
What?

10:29.819 --> 10:32.403
I really wish you'd told
me you were pregnant.

10:32.438 --> 10:33.938
Because you would have
brought a baby gift?

10:33.990 --> 10:35.439
You're an employer.

10:35.492 --> 10:38.025
How would you feel if you
invested precious time

10:38.077 --> 10:39.443
in a big new hire.

10:39.496 --> 10:41.696
And then a month later, she
was out on maternity leave.

10:41.748 --> 10:44.198
- I would recognize that
there are laws in place. - Really?

10:44.250 --> 10:46.284
I can be back in three weeks.

10:46.336 --> 10:48.286
Exhausted. Distracted.

10:48.338 --> 10:50.171
Missing meetings because your
baby's got the sniffles

10:50.206 --> 10:52.507
or your nanny flaked.
So your nanny has never flaked?

10:52.542 --> 10:55.510
I'd built up a
reservoir of good will.

10:55.545 --> 10:57.378
Even still, having
kids, it's limited me.

10:57.430 --> 10:58.763
You're a fucking
great headhunter.

10:58.798 --> 11:00.548
So if a candidate
isn't served up

11:00.600 --> 11:01.883
on a silver platter...

11:01.935 --> 11:03.434
I'm an executive recruiter.

11:03.469 --> 11:05.803
And I am fucking
great at my job.

11:05.855 --> 11:07.138
So am I.

11:07.190 --> 11:08.606
So tell them that.

11:08.641 --> 11:11.025
Tell them that baby or no baby,

11:11.060 --> 11:13.110
no one shrewder or smarter
will walk through their door.

11:13.146 --> 11:16.697
Tell them I am not going
to be one of those mothers.

11:16.733 --> 11:20.034
I will push up against the legal
limits of neglect here, okay?

11:20.069 --> 11:22.954
There will be a seat filler
at every Little League game,

11:22.989 --> 11:24.038
every ballet recital.

11:24.073 --> 11:26.207
My kid is gonna walk
around the house and go,

11:26.242 --> 11:28.326
"Who the fuck is that blonde lady?"
I'm sorry, Jeannie.

11:28.378 --> 11:30.578
I am just having trouble
getting a read on this.

11:30.630 --> 11:32.964
I'm not saying I never
saw you with a kid;

11:32.999 --> 11:34.799
it's the timing.

11:34.834 --> 11:36.384
With your company in flux,

11:36.419 --> 11:38.302
I figured you'd just...

11:38.338 --> 11:39.720
Oh, that's nice.

11:39.756 --> 11:42.056
Oh, don't act all hurt, okay?

11:42.091 --> 11:44.725
We've known each other
for a long time.

11:44.761 --> 11:46.227
If abortion clinics were Subway,

11:46.262 --> 11:48.095
you'd have earned a free
sandwich years ago.

11:48.147 --> 11:49.187
I've never had an abortion.

11:49.232 --> 11:50.314
Okay.

11:50.350 --> 11:51.566
I haven't.

11:51.601 --> 11:53.935
Do you want my medical rec...?

11:53.987 --> 11:54.936
I mean...

11:54.988 --> 11:56.404
Erin...

11:56.439 --> 11:59.407
You've always been so meticulous
and driven about your career.

11:59.442 --> 12:01.192
I don't get
the "Why now?"

12:01.244 --> 12:03.194
I want it all.

12:03.246 --> 12:05.196
Isn't that what every
woman's looking for?

12:05.248 --> 12:07.365
Sure.

12:11.454 --> 12:13.421
Well, it was nice catching up.

12:13.456 --> 12:15.623
Look, I'm happy to put
your name out there.

12:15.675 --> 12:18.626
But my advice is wait
to make a change.

12:18.678 --> 12:20.177
Then, when you're
in that sweet spot

12:20.213 --> 12:21.929
where you've taken off
all the baby weight

12:21.965 --> 12:23.264
but your tits are still huge,

12:23.299 --> 12:25.266
give me a call.

12:27.303 --> 12:28.719
That's probably smart.

12:28.771 --> 12:31.055
You said it yourself.

12:31.107 --> 12:33.724
K and A is rising
from the ashes.

12:33.776 --> 12:34.892
Enjoy the ride.

12:37.313 --> 12:39.614
We are so fucked.

12:39.649 --> 12:41.616
Yeah.

12:41.651 --> 12:43.618
You know, at least you
have a safety valve

12:43.653 --> 12:44.952
with your Kelsey venture.

12:44.988 --> 12:45.953
That is right.

12:45.989 --> 12:47.788
So, basically,
just you're fucked.

12:50.660 --> 12:53.077
So things seem to be proceeding
apace with the app?

12:53.129 --> 12:54.662
They are. They are, Douglas.

12:54.714 --> 12:55.880
Great.

12:55.915 --> 12:58.165
Hey, if you ever want me
to have a little look

12:58.167 --> 12:59.583
at your business plan,
I'd be happy...

12:59.636 --> 13:01.469
No, we're good.
We're good, thanks.

13:01.504 --> 13:03.087
Yeah, no problem.
Thank you, buddy, but we're good.

13:03.139 --> 13:04.889
Good, that's good.
No need to have you on board.

13:04.924 --> 13:06.307
Very good.
That is good, good is good.

13:06.342 --> 13:08.759
But it's not great, and
wouldn't it better to be great?

13:10.146 --> 13:11.929
I can't believe I never thought
about it like that.

13:11.981 --> 13:13.097
Yeah.
Maybe...

13:13.149 --> 13:14.815
Yeah.
Maybe, I don't know.

13:14.851 --> 13:16.317
Hey, you know, I
just had a thought.

13:16.352 --> 13:17.318
Yeah, please.
Can't wait.

13:17.353 --> 13:18.486
I was just spitballing here.

13:18.521 --> 13:19.820
But what if I came on board?

13:19.856 --> 13:20.821
Lended a hand?

13:20.857 --> 13:21.822
And you just had this thought?

13:21.858 --> 13:22.907
Yeah.
Right now, just...

13:22.942 --> 13:24.275
You never thought about it
before this moment?

13:24.327 --> 13:25.576
Bing.
It was like a little lightbulb.

13:25.611 --> 13:26.661
That's what it felt like.

13:26.696 --> 13:27.945
Wow, I didn't notice
that, okay, cool, yeah.

13:27.997 --> 13:30.614
I mean, getting a business
off the ground, it's a bear.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.366
It's tough, yeah.
It is really tough, you know?

13:32.418 --> 13:33.918
The more big brains,
the better, am I right?

13:33.953 --> 13:35.252
And you've got
the biggest brain of all.

13:35.288 --> 13:36.620
Would you...

13:36.673 --> 13:38.039
Stop, you're the living end.

13:38.091 --> 13:39.373
Am I killing you?
This is hilarious?

13:39.425 --> 13:40.708
Oh, my God, we
could bottle this.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.876
This, sure.
And we can.

13:41.928 --> 13:44.011
That's the thing-- the
two of us, side-by-side.

13:44.047 --> 13:45.046
We'd rule the world.

13:45.098 --> 13:46.097
You and I?

13:46.132 --> 13:47.348
Uh-huh, what's
stopping us?

13:47.383 --> 13:49.266
Well, there is...
there is one issue.

13:49.302 --> 13:50.267
Come on, what?

13:50.303 --> 13:51.802
I don't want to.

13:53.022 --> 13:54.972
No, like, I really
don't want to.

13:55.024 --> 13:56.307
Ah, okay.
Yeah.

13:56.359 --> 13:57.775
Well, yeah, I mean,
obviously it's your...

13:57.810 --> 13:59.026
it's your call to make, so...

13:59.062 --> 14:00.227
Thanks, man, it is,
and thank you very much

14:00.279 --> 14:01.562
for understanding, I appreciate it.
Ah, that's fine.

14:01.614 --> 14:02.947
But I don't want you there, so...

14:02.982 --> 14:04.365
That's fi...

14:04.400 --> 14:05.983
Okay, you listen to me,
you little pissant.

14:06.035 --> 14:07.401
All right, you
bring me on board,

14:07.453 --> 14:08.569
or I tell Marty.

14:08.621 --> 14:09.954
I'll tell him how
you're moonlighting.

14:09.989 --> 14:11.155
How you're splitting your focus.

14:11.207 --> 14:13.240
Hey, Marty, I'm actually, uh,

14:13.292 --> 14:15.409
developing a new piece of
software with one of the coders

14:15.461 --> 14:17.294
from Yo Where's the Party App.

14:17.330 --> 14:19.714
Who gives a shit?
Who gives a shit?

14:19.749 --> 14:21.132
- Okay, either one of you guys
talk to Jeannie? - No.

14:21.167 --> 14:23.300
I swear to God...

14:23.336 --> 14:24.635
Answer the phone, Jeannie.

14:24.670 --> 14:26.053
Answer the phone!

14:26.089 --> 14:28.139
What, is that one of those
old-school answering machines

14:28.174 --> 14:29.757
where they can
actually hear you...?

14:29.809 --> 14:31.559
That's not the right time,
Doug, shut the fuck up.

14:31.594 --> 14:33.644
I did...
What are you talking about?

14:33.679 --> 14:35.646
Okay, do you want to guess

14:35.681 --> 14:37.982
what caused Ellis' little act
of road rage?

14:38.017 --> 14:39.233
What is it?

14:39.268 --> 14:41.902
If you said the moldings
on the gear-shift panel

14:41.938 --> 14:44.021
weren't rounded enough,
give yourself a cookie.

14:44.073 --> 14:45.272
Are you fucking serious?

14:45.324 --> 14:46.607
No, wait...

14:46.659 --> 14:49.577
So, without a car to show,
then there's no town hall?

14:49.612 --> 14:51.912
N-N-N-No, if there's no town
hall, Ellis goes tits up.

14:51.948 --> 14:54.031
And if he's dead,
guess who else is...

14:54.083 --> 14:55.082
Oh, beautiful.

14:55.118 --> 14:56.250
Hey, Jeannie.

14:56.285 --> 14:57.284
Where the fuck have you been?

14:57.336 --> 14:58.452
Looking for a new job

14:58.454 --> 14:59.954
since you want me gone
from our company.

14:59.956 --> 15:01.255
So maybe ease up
on the throttle.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.456
Listen, listen, listen.

15:02.508 --> 15:04.675
Ellis literally took a piss
on the prototype.

15:04.710 --> 15:05.676
Okay, so...

15:05.711 --> 15:06.877
So you are gonna
high-tail your ass

15:06.929 --> 15:08.429
to Berkeley,

15:08.464 --> 15:10.347
and go whisper sweet nothings
into Maya Lindholm's ear.

15:10.383 --> 15:12.199
We talked about that
when we booked the consult,

15:12.235 --> 15:13.884
but we dismissed it
as a fool's errand.

15:13.936 --> 15:15.886
Yeah, well, it's back
on the fucking table, Boo-Boo,

15:15.938 --> 15:18.139
because we got
no goddamn choice.

15:18.191 --> 15:20.341
Good to talk to you.

15:22.000 --> 15:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:37.960 --> 15:40.044
Oh, wow.

15:40.079 --> 15:43.714
People dreamed of
doubling the density

15:43.749 --> 15:45.716
of the standard
lithium ion battery,

15:45.751 --> 15:47.301
and you guys are quadrupling it?

15:47.336 --> 15:48.636
That's exciting.

15:48.671 --> 15:50.221
Yeah. Well, thanks.

15:50.256 --> 15:51.639
And, actually, when you...
And still the intended.

15:51.674 --> 15:53.724
MSRP is only 12 grand?

15:53.759 --> 15:56.727
You're actually building
a zero-emission car

15:56.762 --> 15:58.729
that a working
person can afford.

15:58.764 --> 16:01.232
I applaud that.
I just don't understand.

16:01.267 --> 16:03.684
How is it not gonna be
a huge money suck?

16:03.736 --> 16:07.104
Well, each car will cost us
$10,000 to manufacture...

16:07.156 --> 16:08.439
Sure, that's what they'll cost

16:08.491 --> 16:10.608
once you have a
significant unit volume,

16:10.660 --> 16:11.942
but how long is that gonna take,

16:11.994 --> 16:14.528
considering you have
no physical plant,

16:14.580 --> 16:16.697
no distribution network,
no technicians,

16:16.749 --> 16:18.449
no marketing...
I'm sorry. Who are you here to see?

16:18.501 --> 16:20.501
- Did I not...
-  Sorry.

16:20.536 --> 16:22.920
Pregnancy brain. Always.
I'm Jeannie Van Der Hooven.

16:22.955 --> 16:24.371
Oh.
I'm a management consultant.

16:24.423 --> 16:26.590
Oh. Well, we're not
at the consultant stage yet,

16:26.626 --> 16:27.707
Jeannie, but...
That's okay.

16:27.710 --> 16:29.093
I'm not here to reel you in.

16:29.128 --> 16:30.294
I am here

16:30.346 --> 16:31.846
on behalf of another client.

16:31.881 --> 16:33.347
Ellis Hightower.

16:36.219 --> 16:39.186
Okay, geniuses, now what?

16:39.222 --> 16:41.355
Well, the speculation has been

16:41.390 --> 16:43.057
that you're announcing
a rollout.

16:43.109 --> 16:44.389
But because we've kept
this event

16:44.393 --> 16:46.360
shrouded in secrecy,
we got options.

16:46.395 --> 16:48.229
Mm-hmm.
Right. So we just need a compelling reason

16:48.231 --> 16:50.030
for the town hall.
Yeah, something that's gonna land

16:50.066 --> 16:51.699
above the masthead
of <i> The Huff Post.</i>

16:51.734 --> 16:53.317
Look. Okay.
Don't think.

16:53.369 --> 16:54.735
Just say a name.

16:54.787 --> 16:56.153
Mm-hmm.
Who's the best engineer

16:56.205 --> 16:57.204
that's ever worked here?

16:57.240 --> 16:58.372
Go.
Bam.

16:58.407 --> 16:59.907
Are you thinking?

16:59.959 --> 17:00.824
So don't think, remember?

17:00.877 --> 17:01.909
The best engineer

17:01.911 --> 17:03.744
I ever worked with
was Maya Lindholm.

17:03.746 --> 17:05.212
- What does that have to do...
- Boom.

17:05.248 --> 17:06.213
Boom.
That's it. That's the one.

17:06.249 --> 17:07.882
"Dynamic Duo
Rides Again."

17:07.916 --> 17:09.465
Mmm.
Oh, boy.

17:09.502 --> 17:12.136
"Gage Cofounders Reunite
in Historic Partnership."

17:12.171 --> 17:13.921
Oh. Ellis,
do you see it?

17:13.973 --> 17:15.638
That, my friend, is a goddamn headline.
Yeah.

17:15.675 --> 17:18.976
Or we go with this headline:
"Gage Founder Chokes

17:19.011 --> 17:21.512
on Own Dick Before Ever Working
with That Cunt Again."

17:27.936 --> 17:28.936
Are you kidding me?

17:28.988 --> 17:30.938
He has got
a borderline personality.

17:30.990 --> 17:33.607
He's a raging misogynist.

17:33.659 --> 17:34.775
I hate his voice.

17:34.827 --> 17:38.696
I hate his stupid
macrobiotic diet. And...

17:38.748 --> 17:41.999
She blames herself entirely.
Yeah, she actually said that leaving here

17:42.034 --> 17:44.251
was the biggest mistake
she ever made because...

17:44.287 --> 17:47.755
I lost millions in
stock options, but I thank God

17:47.790 --> 17:51.542
every day that I don't have to
work with that pompous asshole.

17:51.594 --> 17:54.295
Ha. She never embraced
the notion that this company's

17:54.297 --> 17:56.547
on a divine mission
to reshape the universe.

17:56.599 --> 17:58.882
Not to mention he's really
warmed to the idea

17:58.935 --> 18:00.551
of serving a low-end market.

18:00.603 --> 18:02.519
Ellis loves your car.

18:02.555 --> 18:06.056
Here's another headline: "Gage
Founder Again Chokes on Own Dick

18:06.108 --> 18:07.474
"Before Building Any Version

18:07.476 --> 18:10.277
of Maya's Cheap Ass
Electric Crap Box."

18:10.313 --> 18:12.730
You don't think Japan is gonna
reverse engineer your technology

18:12.782 --> 18:14.615
in a nanosecond
and flood the market?

18:14.650 --> 18:18.118
Probably with a ludicrous
markup, too. With Gage,

18:18.154 --> 18:19.620
you're up and running
in a heartbeat.

18:19.655 --> 18:20.935
It'll never see
the light of day.

18:20.957 --> 18:22.740
Once Maya's on board,
just bury the car.

18:22.792 --> 18:24.124
Come on. You don't think
you can roll her?

18:24.160 --> 18:25.159
Listen, get her down here.

18:25.161 --> 18:26.243
You do whatever the fuck
you want.

18:26.295 --> 18:27.711
Right.
And you will have full...

18:27.747 --> 18:29.246
...operational
control.

18:29.298 --> 18:31.332
I won't even consider this
if I don't have it.

18:31.384 --> 18:32.549
- You'll have it.
<i>- You still want</i>

18:32.585 --> 18:34.168
to be running a company
tomorrow?

18:34.170 --> 18:35.836
We got no other moves.

18:35.888 --> 18:37.004
Fine.

18:37.056 --> 18:38.255
Fine.

18:38.307 --> 18:41.925
Hey, I just hit 7-Eleven,
and, huh, look what I got.

18:41.978 --> 18:44.144
Baby Ruth.
I don't think you can eat in here, Doug.

18:44.180 --> 18:46.013
It's your favorite, though, right, Clyde?
Yeah.

18:46.015 --> 18:49.066
I'd give you some, but, uh,
guess what, I don't want to.

18:49.101 --> 18:51.068
No, I <i> really</i> don't want to.

18:51.103 --> 18:52.519
- What are you doing?
- Mmm.

18:52.571 --> 18:53.854
Oh, this is gonna be good.

18:53.906 --> 18:56.106
Excuse me, sir?
He's got food.

18:56.158 --> 18:58.025
Don't...
Excuse me, sir.

18:58.077 --> 18:59.860
You can't, you can't
eat this in here.

18:59.862 --> 19:01.495
Yeah, I understand that.
You can't eat in here.

19:01.530 --> 19:03.864
It's not, it's not about eating.
It was about proving a point.

19:03.866 --> 19:05.916
"You can't eat this in here" is what he said.
Mm-hmm. I got it.

19:05.951 --> 19:07.034
You're a dick. You know that?

19:07.086 --> 19:08.687
Because I won't let you
join my company?!

19:08.704 --> 19:10.120
It's a business,
not a weekly poker game.

19:10.172 --> 19:13.340
Which I also have
and you also can't join.

19:13.376 --> 19:15.042
You know Sarah left
me and you have never

19:15.094 --> 19:16.760
asked me once how I feel!

19:16.796 --> 19:18.762
You wanted her to go.
She wiped me out!

19:18.798 --> 19:20.214
Not a cent left
in my bank account.

19:20.266 --> 19:21.715
My car, my furniture.

19:21.767 --> 19:22.850
She sold my bird.

19:22.885 --> 19:24.685
She... she sold your bird?

19:24.720 --> 19:25.719
Well, he's gone!

19:25.771 --> 19:26.887
He could just be gone!

19:26.889 --> 19:27.938
It's not funny, Clyde.

19:27.973 --> 19:29.056
It's pretty funny.
She sold...

19:29.058 --> 19:30.391
It's not funny!

19:31.977 --> 19:33.610
All right. Okay.

19:33.646 --> 19:35.312
I'm sorry that happened to you.

19:35.364 --> 19:37.981
Sincerely, Doug, I am sorry
that happened to you.

19:38.034 --> 19:40.367
I have nothing, Clyde.

19:40.403 --> 19:42.870
I mean it. Nothing.

19:42.905 --> 19:44.872
Chances are this app
won't make any money.

19:44.907 --> 19:46.623
Most startups don't.

19:46.659 --> 19:48.709
It's not even about the money.

19:48.744 --> 19:50.377
I mean, it's probably a little
bit about the money.

19:50.413 --> 19:51.662
Obviously, a part of it is the money
because I need money, you know.

19:51.714 --> 19:54.381
But...
I'll discuss it with Kelsey.

19:54.417 --> 19:55.582
Really?
Yeah.

19:55.634 --> 19:56.667
I don't want to, but I will.

19:56.719 --> 19:57.885
Just got off the
phone with Jeannie.

19:57.920 --> 19:58.886
She and Maya will be
here any minute.

19:58.921 --> 19:59.887
Okay.
That's good.

19:59.922 --> 20:01.422
What are you guys babbling...?

20:01.424 --> 20:04.224
Will you please
welcome Gage founder and CEO

20:04.260 --> 20:06.226
Ellis Hightower!

20:06.262 --> 20:07.594
? Here we go, here we go ?

20:07.646 --> 20:09.763
? You're the champion,
here we go, here we go ?

20:09.815 --> 20:10.981
? You're the champion,
you're the champ ?

20:11.016 --> 20:12.733
? Here we go, here we go ?

20:12.768 --> 20:14.485
? You're the champion,
you're the champ ?

20:14.520 --> 20:16.019
? You're the champ,
you're the champions ?

20:16.072 --> 20:18.355
? You're the, you're the,
you're the... ?

20:18.407 --> 20:20.407
Where's your boy?

20:21.444 --> 20:24.445
Dramatic pause...

20:38.377 --> 20:40.177
Fuck us.

20:40.212 --> 20:42.212
Ellis?

20:43.716 --> 20:45.716
Ellis?

20:45.768 --> 20:47.768
Hey, Ellis?

21:06.122 --> 21:07.454
Ellis, is...?

21:07.490 --> 21:09.623
Is there somebody
you want me to call or...

21:09.658 --> 21:11.708
some-some meds I can locate?

21:13.496 --> 21:15.329
Oh, no.

21:15.331 --> 21:17.581
Listen, buddy, I know
that you've been under

21:17.633 --> 21:18.966
a lot of pressure, okay?

21:19.001 --> 21:20.417
But if you could
just get it together,

21:20.469 --> 21:22.336
and we could get
right out there...

21:22.388 --> 21:24.471
My father is dead.

21:25.758 --> 21:28.175
Oh, God.

21:28.227 --> 21:31.145
Aw, shit.

21:31.180 --> 21:32.596
I'm sorry.

21:32.648 --> 21:34.815
When... when did you find out?

21:34.850 --> 21:37.151
Nine years ago.

21:37.186 --> 21:40.020
"Nine years ago."

21:43.776 --> 21:45.993
I'm okay. I'm strong.

21:46.028 --> 21:47.411
Strong motherfucker.

21:47.446 --> 21:49.530
That's right.

21:49.582 --> 21:51.415
You know what matrix
tortuosity is?

21:51.450 --> 21:53.116
I-I do not, no.

21:53.169 --> 21:54.251
No one does.

21:54.286 --> 21:57.037
Well, then...
But my father?

21:57.039 --> 21:59.540
He was the world's
foremost expert.

21:59.542 --> 22:01.208
He was the toast of Caltech.

22:01.260 --> 22:02.259
Ah.

22:02.294 --> 22:05.012
Fucking egghead shitheel.

22:05.047 --> 22:07.714
He always thought I was an
intellectual lightweight.

22:07.766 --> 22:09.016
What?

22:09.051 --> 22:11.018
More of a salesman, he said,
than a real thinker.

22:11.053 --> 22:12.052
Yeah, yeah.

22:12.104 --> 22:14.137
How about we get
out there and, you know,

22:14.190 --> 22:16.974
and you put all that into the speech...
When he was dying...

22:17.026 --> 22:18.942
I went to the hospital.

22:18.978 --> 22:20.861
And I showed him the
blueprints that Maya and I

22:20.896 --> 22:22.529
had devised for our first car.

22:22.565 --> 22:24.198
He said I was smart...

22:24.233 --> 22:25.816
Hey!

22:25.868 --> 22:27.568
...to hitch my wagon
to a real scientist.

22:28.954 --> 22:30.237
Told him to go fuck himself.

22:30.289 --> 22:32.322
Mm-hmm.
And he didn't get me.

22:32.374 --> 22:34.241
But he did get me.

22:34.293 --> 22:35.909
He totally got me.

22:35.961 --> 22:36.960
Oh, come on.

22:36.996 --> 22:38.462
You said it yourself.

22:38.497 --> 22:40.380
I'm nothing without Maya.
No!

22:40.416 --> 22:41.665
I wanted...
Giant piece of shit!

22:41.717 --> 22:43.166
Oh, no, listen...
I should be shot!

22:43.219 --> 22:44.668
Ellis, I... listen.

22:44.720 --> 22:47.504
I was just trying
to-to-to buck you up, man.

22:47.556 --> 22:49.306
You know?

22:50.843 --> 22:52.809
Fuck.

22:52.845 --> 22:54.478
I'm nothing.

22:54.513 --> 22:55.729
There, there.

22:55.764 --> 22:57.731
You know, Ellis' behavior

22:57.766 --> 22:59.516
isn't actually that strange.

22:59.568 --> 23:01.768
Hitler was known
for having similar outbursts.

23:01.820 --> 23:03.937
Yeah, in fact, the Germans
even had a term for it.

23:03.939 --> 23:05.572
Yeah.
<i>Teppichfresser.</i>

23:05.608 --> 23:07.274
Yeah, a lot of great men
have tantrums.

23:07.326 --> 23:08.766
Just so you know--
that's your second

23:08.777 --> 23:10.444
positive Hitler reference
of the day.

23:10.496 --> 23:12.863
I'm using "great" in the sense

23:12.915 --> 23:14.831
of historically important.
Sure. No need to get defensive.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.583
I'm sure some of my relatives
who were put to death

23:16.619 --> 23:19.036
by the Nazis were total douche bags.
Yeah.

23:19.088 --> 23:20.954
Thank you.
There she is.

23:21.006 --> 23:23.040
Where's Maya?
She'll be here in a sec.

23:23.092 --> 23:24.458
Why are you in the...?

23:24.460 --> 23:25.500
Uh, town hall's been

23:25.511 --> 23:27.544
put on hold due
to technical difficulties.

23:27.596 --> 23:29.263
The "technical difficulties"
being?

23:29.298 --> 23:31.131
The founder of the company is
currently in the second floor

23:31.133 --> 23:33.050
stairwell crying like a baby.

23:34.970 --> 23:36.937
Hold these.

23:44.980 --> 23:46.480
Well, this is fucking adorable.

23:46.532 --> 23:47.531
Yeah, Ellis

23:47.566 --> 23:49.783
is, um... a little down.

23:49.818 --> 23:51.068
I'm a fraud! I'm a poser!

23:51.120 --> 23:52.953
My dad was right.

23:52.988 --> 23:54.321
Dante Valerio was right.

23:54.373 --> 23:55.872
I'm a fucking...
Jesus Christ, grow a pair.

23:55.908 --> 23:57.074
Jeannie...

23:57.126 --> 23:58.742
Move.

23:58.794 --> 24:00.661
Here, we're gonna let Mama

24:00.713 --> 24:02.162
come in here, okay?
All right, all right.

24:02.164 --> 24:03.580
Listen.

24:03.632 --> 24:04.631
You are

24:04.667 --> 24:07.751
a flawed...
deeply, deeply flawed

24:07.803 --> 24:10.337
human being, but...

24:10.389 --> 24:12.005
they're not right.

24:12.057 --> 24:14.308
When you start
believing in them,

24:14.343 --> 24:16.476
when they get to you,

24:16.512 --> 24:18.845
when you're crying
in a goddamn stairwell...

24:18.897 --> 24:20.480
I'm not crying. I'm...

24:20.516 --> 24:21.648
...that's when the assholes

24:21.684 --> 24:23.016
start popping champagne corks.

24:23.068 --> 24:24.401
That's when it happens.

24:24.436 --> 24:26.153
They don't get to win.

24:26.188 --> 24:28.238
Okay?

24:28.273 --> 24:29.573
So, wipe the snot
from your nose.

24:29.608 --> 24:32.242
Get back out
into that auditorium.

24:32.277 --> 24:33.910
Or I'm gonna beat
the living fuck out of you.

24:33.946 --> 24:35.362
What?

24:35.414 --> 24:38.081
Did you think I was joking?

24:38.117 --> 24:40.701
She's... Ooh!
Fuck! What are you doing?!

24:40.753 --> 24:42.836
Stop it! Stop it! Marty, Marty!
Don't think she's gonna stop it...

24:42.871 --> 24:45.789
Don't think she's gonna stop,
buddy. Okay, let's rally.

24:45.841 --> 24:47.708
There you go.
Get in there.

24:53.849 --> 24:57.184
Sometimes the boldest
step into the future

24:57.219 --> 24:59.219
is to remember
what made the past

24:59.271 --> 25:01.638
so memorable.
Which is why

25:01.690 --> 25:03.857
today I am thrilled to announce

25:03.892 --> 25:05.559
that Gage is entering into

25:05.611 --> 25:07.944
an exciting new partnership.

25:09.198 --> 25:11.198
Does anyone else
smell patchouli?

25:11.233 --> 25:12.949
Yeah. All right.

25:12.985 --> 25:15.535
Ladies and gentlemen,
oh, my God, it's Maya Lindholm.

25:24.663 --> 25:26.913
Now we just have
to get them to officially

25:26.965 --> 25:28.498
come to terms.
Oh.

25:28.550 --> 25:30.667
I can't see how that could be a problem.
Yeah.

25:35.307 --> 25:38.341
Today's announcement
is a victory not only for Gage,

25:38.394 --> 25:41.511
but for environmentally
conscious innovation.

25:41.563 --> 25:44.765
And I cannot wait to see
what bold leaps forward

25:44.767 --> 25:48.151
these two great
visionaries have in store.

25:49.688 --> 25:53.440
We somehow managed to pull
that rabbit out of our ass.

25:53.442 --> 25:56.443
Huh. Jeannie want
a pat on the head?

25:56.445 --> 25:58.862
I know you couldn't
have done it without me.

25:58.914 --> 26:00.914
I guess that'll
have to be enough.

26:11.877 --> 26:13.343
I presume you came to gloat.

26:14.847 --> 26:17.297
Okay.

26:17.349 --> 26:19.516
So it's like old times?

26:23.138 --> 26:25.305
We both know
that I am not the one

26:25.307 --> 26:26.890
you want to anger-bang
right now.

26:29.027 --> 26:31.895
Oh, oh, oh.

26:35.701 --> 26:37.984
Is she loud like this?

26:38.036 --> 26:39.736
Or is she more of a squeaker?

26:43.826 --> 26:47.744
Oh. I know
I betrayed you, Marty,

26:47.796 --> 26:51.331
but I... I'm still
your precious Jeannie Bean.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.083
Oh, yeah, it just

26:53.135 --> 26:54.835
feels so right.

26:54.887 --> 26:57.504
Oh, it's like
your dick was custom-built

26:57.556 --> 26:58.805
for my little...

26:58.841 --> 27:01.091
perfect pussy.

27:01.143 --> 27:02.976
Oh...

27:03.011 --> 27:05.679
Oh, yeah, just
make me whole, Marty, please.

27:05.731 --> 27:09.566
Just make me whole.

27:09.601 --> 27:12.602
? I do the devil's work
seven days a week ?

27:12.654 --> 27:14.604
Ah.

27:14.656 --> 27:17.741
? I'll go to church, I'll make my peace ?

27:17.776 --> 27:26.669
