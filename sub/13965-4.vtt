JOHN:
Previously on Killjoys...

00:03.212 --> 00:05.919
We tried landing on Arkyn,
and it's not empty.

00:06.007 --> 00:07.543
There's some kind of
manmade defense layer.

00:07.675 --> 00:09.916
Why are you
always chasing dragons?

00:10.011 --> 00:13.595
I don't hit women,
but I got a partner
who does. So, lady, be nice.

00:13.681 --> 00:16.423
Oh, relax.
Don't be such a killjoy.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.765
Ha! ljust got that.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.722
Johnny?
Are you on your way?

00:20.813 --> 00:21.928
(PAWTER GRUNTS)

00:23.482 --> 00:27.816
You didn't mention that
massive data transmission
Khlyen sent

00:27.904 --> 00:29.440
just before they
blew up the base.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.519
It was encrypted.

00:30.615 --> 00:32.901
Find out where it went.
Write me a warrant
to get there.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.402
I need to know
what's in that file.

00:35.620 --> 00:37.201
(ALARM BLARING)

00:40.958 --> 00:42.459
(SCREAMING)

00:45.546 --> 00:46.956
D'AVIN: You sure
you wanna do this?

00:47.632 --> 00:48.792
Last time, you got hurt.

00:48.883 --> 00:53.092
You need to let that go.
I want this.

00:53.179 --> 00:55.261
How bad?

00:55.348 --> 00:57.259
All the bad you've got.

00:59.185 --> 01:00.174
(GRUNTING)

01:02.313 --> 01:03.302
Ow!

01:05.274 --> 01:08.061
My mom taught me that.
Oh, respect.

01:08.361 --> 01:09.601
(D'AVIN GRUNTS)

01:10.613 --> 01:13.696
Too bad she didn't teach you
how to fight like a girl.

01:13.783 --> 01:15.694
So, where's Monkpants?

01:15.785 --> 01:17.491
Alvis? At the monastery,

01:17.578 --> 01:19.114
researching
Scarbacks on Arkyn.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.074
Oh, yeah? Good.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.330
Look, it's a small ship.

01:27.421 --> 01:28.581
I don't want things
getting weird.

01:28.673 --> 01:30.129
Weird how?

01:32.343 --> 01:36.677
You and me are complicated,
Alvis is simple.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.176
So, if stuff happens,
it happens.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.594
ljust wanna say,
we're good.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.008
Aw!
(GRUNTS)

01:47.024 --> 01:49.356
Okay. Now, it's weird.

01:49.735 --> 01:50.895
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:52.029 --> 01:54.406
DUTCH: Yeah. Little bit.

01:54.490 --> 01:56.731
Nice to see you guys
keeping shit platonic.

01:56.826 --> 01:59.533
LUCY:
/ have RAC Officer Turin
on an encrypted channel.

01:59.662 --> 02:01.869
Timing, Lucy. Timing.

02:01.998 --> 02:03.329
Not interrupting, am I?

02:03.416 --> 02:06.032
Depends.
Why are you calling?

02:06.127 --> 02:08.664
/ know where Red 17’s
last transmission went.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.582
Definitely not interrupting.
Where?

02:10.673 --> 02:12.664
Prodigy School.
Quadrant 4.

02:12.800 --> 02:13.835
Prodigy School?

02:13.926 --> 02:15.257
A school for
gifted Westy kids.

02:15.344 --> 02:18.336
Taking the smart kids
away to better schools
used to be optional.

02:18.431 --> 02:20.296
Now, it’s mandatory.

02:20.391 --> 02:23.053
RAC handles all the Escort
warrants for the students,

02:23.144 --> 02:24.179
so, / got your team one.

02:24.270 --> 02:28.479
To escort students?
Like, small people?

02:29.150 --> 02:31.482
Children, Dutch.
They're called "children."

02:32.403 --> 02:34.815
Why is Khlyen sending
a transmission to a school?

02:34.905 --> 02:36.441
That's a little creepy.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.989
It’s a lot creepy.
So, get in there
and find out.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.328
But do anything
other than what
the warrant requires,

02:41.412 --> 02:42.743
you’re on your own.

02:43.289 --> 02:46.326
Fine. We'll do it.
But you get to babysit.

02:46.417 --> 02:47.577
Screw that.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.408
One of the three kids
is in Old Town.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.335
Johnny should be done
springing Pawter.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.504
I say we swing by en route,
make him babysit.

02:53.591 --> 02:56.378
Even better.
Lucy, take us in.

02:56.469 --> 02:57.549
LUCY: Will do.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.799
Grab your provisions.
Old Town must be
living hell these days.

03:01.057 --> 03:02.422
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

03:03.601 --> 03:05.933
Hell is drunker
than I remember.

(CROWD CHEERING)

03:10.941 --> 03:14.104
Hey! Jelco let you back
inside the wall?

03:14.195 --> 03:16.527
Even Jelco can't
override a warrant.

03:16.614 --> 03:18.195
Food and medicine.
Oh!

03:18.282 --> 03:20.773
Now, that calls
for a drink.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.404
Is that shit even legal?

03:22.495 --> 03:24.360
This shit
isn't even drinkable.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.661
Just don't tell them.

03:25.790 --> 03:26.950
We're looking for this kid.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.030
His father's a miner,

03:28.125 --> 03:29.865
and their old address
is a pile of rubble.

03:30.086 --> 03:31.121
Sabine!

03:31.921 --> 03:34.663
Sabine used to work
at the mine's canteen.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.421
My friends here are
looking for this boy.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.668
Killjoys hunt kids now?
Times must be tough.

03:40.763 --> 03:43.721
No, we're not arresting him.
He qualified for Prodigy.

03:43.808 --> 03:46.641
We're taking
the class to school,
where it's safe.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.560
That's actually sweet.

03:49.647 --> 03:50.932
Prodigy's about
the only nice thing

03:51.023 --> 03:52.559
The Company does
for us Westies.

03:52.650 --> 03:55.141
Well, it feels good
to give back, you know?

03:56.487 --> 03:57.897
SABINE:
Try the East Tenements.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.445
Most families
migrated there
after the bombings.

04:02.952 --> 04:04.658
Johnny here yet?
No.

04:04.829 --> 04:06.035
Butyourboy
left you a message.

04:06.122 --> 04:08.579
With you? Which means
I'm not gonna like it.

04:08.666 --> 04:10.782
Pawter busted herself
out of Spring Hill

04:10.876 --> 04:12.616
by putting a bomb
in Jelco's chest,

04:12.753 --> 04:14.744
and making a run
for the Salt Plains.

04:14.839 --> 04:17.376
(LAUGHS) Johnny's
tracking her down.

04:17.466 --> 04:19.172
He may be a skootch late.

04:19.301 --> 04:20.677
Lucy, you sure
this is the place?

04:20.761 --> 04:24.049
LUCY:
The Doctor’s last signal was
broadcast from this location.

04:24.140 --> 04:26.426
If she’s not here,
she’s probably dead.

torn my arm off.

in case you run out
of anesthetic.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.921
Hey. Salt Plains Law,
she wins, she goes.

05:48.140 --> 05:50.756
That's before I knew
she was a doctor.

one of my boys

05:52.102 --> 05:53.603
settled down with
a good woman.

05:53.771 --> 05:55.636
Did she just
propose to you?

05:55.731 --> 05:57.596
Listen,
I'm very flattered...

05:57.691 --> 05:59.522
And very outnumbered.

You can handle this part.

is this what you saw?

a distraction.

who...

Sleeps with her patients?

Fuses a bomb to the chest
of the most dangerous man
in Westerley.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.722
She could get
Johnny hurt.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.762
Won't stop him
from helping her.

couldn't knock

makes us a great team.

to lose that?

What happened?

07:48.260 --> 07:49.841
I thought we made
a pretty good team
back there.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.634
It's not you. It's...

07:51.722 --> 07:53.758
I don't even know
where to start.

07:53.849 --> 07:55.714
You can start with
why you left Spring Hill.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.549
I mean, Jelco's a dick,
but he'd never
hurt Qreshi royalty.

07:57.686 --> 08:00.223
What if Qreshi royalty's
the problem?

08:00.564 --> 08:02.429
I stole this from Jelco.
It's got Company plans

08:02.524 --> 08:04.560
for building walls
around every major town
on Westerley.

08:04.693 --> 08:06.729
Why? I thought
they put the wall up
because Old Town rebelled.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.357
So did I. But it looks like
Old Town's just
a part of a bigger plan.

08:09.448 --> 08:10.563
l have to warn people.

worked out
all the kinks yet.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.209
We'll get him there safely.
You have my word.

09:48.297 --> 09:52.540
Doesn't matter. As soon as
they leave Westerley,
they forget all about us.

since his brother
went to Prodigy.

gonna take from us next?

What if he doesn't even
want me here?

they stab you in it.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.419
Hmm?

11:22.891 --> 11:24.802
You stabbed your brother?

11:24.893 --> 11:26.849
Just a little bit.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.802
And it was
in the front,
not the back.

11:28.897 --> 11:31.104

I will find.

Don't know.

Fine. But she's

when the pods were opened?

15:42.234 --> 15:43.815

should tell me.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.964
They'll send you back to Dad.

33:31.218 --> 33:33.925
They're gonna hand
me over to The Company
for more experiments!

33:34.013 --> 33:35.093
Is that what you want?

33:35.222 --> 33:37.599
Stay back, Jake.

33:37.725 --> 33:39.090
The game is over, Olan.

33:41.604 --> 33:43.344
You're the
smart one, right?

33:43.439 --> 33:45.270
So you know
if I touch these
two wires together,

33:45.357 --> 33:47.188
it sends a surge to
Lucy's power core.

33:49.153 --> 33:52.691
You want to take me
back to Westerley?
I'll send us back in pieces.

33:57.953 --> 34:01.161
Put the wires down, Olan.
You're not a killer.

34:01.248 --> 34:03.159
I think we both
know that's a lie.

34:03.542 --> 34:07.000
You know, I'm betting
that Bruxton was
a miscalculation.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.339
You didn't plan
for his heart defect.
But why did you kill Chambers?

34:09.423 --> 34:12.460
Because she tried
to kill me.

34:13.344 --> 34:16.461
I woke up from that pod,
and my head was on fire.

34:17.181 --> 34:20.969
Chambers was
over me, shaking me.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.351
So, I pushed her off
into a pod.

34:24.438 --> 34:27.680
Look, I think she
was trying to save you.

34:27.775 --> 34:29.561
There was
a massive data surge,

34:29.652 --> 34:33.770
and it triggered the pods'
sterilization sub-routines.

34:33.864 --> 34:38.073
Hey, look, lthink that
she was trying to
pull you out of your...

34:38.160 --> 34:40.867
Out of your pod
before it killed you.

34:40.955 --> 34:42.035
Bullshit.

34:42.122 --> 34:45.159
A system malfunction
killed your class, Olan.
Not Chambers.

34:45.376 --> 34:47.958
All that data,
it was rerouted
through your neurofeeders,

34:48.128 --> 34:49.413
encoded onto your brain.

34:49.505 --> 34:51.041

what that's like.

you have this chance.

You have a chance to
make everything better,

how you want Jake
to remember you?
