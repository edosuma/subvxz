WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:07.655
reads words on screen

00:11.620 --> 00:12.172
A neighbour
walking their dog-

00:12.172 --> 00:12.620
gave us a description-

00:12.620 --> 00:13.344
of the driver-

00:13.344 --> 00:14.068
and the car.

00:14.068 --> 00:14.965
Nice day.

00:14.965 --> 00:16.206
It's my
sister, Crystal.

00:16.206 --> 00:17.137
I'm
in big trouble.

00:18.034 --> 00:19.448
Can you come
meet me?

00:19.448 --> 00:20.344
Where is she?

00:20.344 --> 00:21.655
Northern
Ontario, last I checked.

00:26.379 --> 00:27.241
Everybody hold on!

00:30.172 --> 00:30.827
You're going to-

00:30.827 --> 00:31.862
go get help.

00:31.862 --> 00:33.241
And then you're going
to come back to us safe.

00:33.896 --> 00:35.896
Are you lost?

00:35.896 --> 00:36.724
Don't worry.

00:36.724 --> 00:38.103
Still have that
chain in the yard?

00:39.172 --> 00:40.758
When we crashed-

00:40.758 --> 00:42.448
it caused some
internal trauma-

00:42.551 --> 00:43.896
which means-

00:43.896 --> 00:45.068
you'll need to operate.

00:45.068 --> 00:46.241
I'm going to give
you instructions.

00:46.241 --> 00:47.793
You'll just need to
remember them all.

00:49.344 --> 00:49.931
No no no no!

00:49.931 --> 00:50.586
Sarah come on!

00:50.586 --> 00:51.275
Come on Sarah!

00:57.931 --> 00:59.034
Okay.

00:59.034 --> 01:00.620
We're going
to snap this.

01:00.827 --> 01:01.620
Okay.

01:02.862 --> 01:03.758
There you go.

01:03.758 --> 01:04.448
Okay.

01:04.931 --> 01:05.758
Sarah.

01:06.241 --> 01:07.103
Sarah.

01:07.103 --> 01:07.758
Sarah, come on.

01:07.758 --> 01:08.793
Wake up, wake up.

01:08.793 --> 01:09.896
Please!

01:27.689 --> 01:28.793
Detective Scott.

01:29.448 --> 01:30.413
You were right.

01:31.551 --> 01:34.275
Crystal Mills was working
for Royal Cleaners.

01:34.275 --> 01:36.448
But they don't contract
to Basal Mining.

01:36.448 --> 01:38.103
Well what other companies
do they service?

01:40.413 --> 01:42.034
Kinney Technical Solutions?

01:42.034 --> 01:44.379
It's an industrial waste
treatment company.

01:44.379 --> 01:46.448
Wayne Kinney's company
handles waste treatment-

01:46.448 --> 01:47.379
for Basal Mining.

01:47.379 --> 01:49.000
He worked with Daniel.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
He told me that he didn't
know Crystal or Nick.

01:51.000 --> 01:53.724
It's not surprising that
the owner of the company-

01:53.724 --> 01:55.172
doesn't know the name
of an after-hours cleaner.

01:56.758 --> 01:58.379
But does that make
Kinney a suspect?

01:58.379 --> 01:59.379
Or a target?

01:59.379 --> 02:00.482
I don't know yet.

02:00.482 --> 02:02.758
This must be the connection
between the two cases.

02:02.758 --> 02:04.206
Single-minded as always.

02:04.206 --> 02:05.137
Yeah, well-

02:05.137 --> 02:06.689
one of the many things
you love about me.

02:32.793 --> 02:33.827
What the- ?

02:42.344 --> 02:43.413
Hey!

02:43.413 --> 02:44.448
Buddy!

02:44.448 --> 02:45.862
Where did you
come from?

03:01.482 --> 03:02.862
Where's your owner?

03:02.862 --> 03:03.931
Are you lost?

03:10.827 --> 03:11.551
Easy, easy

03:11.551 --> 03:12.379
Hey there.

03:13.310 --> 03:14.482
How're you doing?

03:14.482 --> 03:15.655
There he is,
the little bugger.

03:15.655 --> 03:17.000
He got loose
from my truck.

03:17.000 --> 03:17.758
This your dog?

03:17.758 --> 03:18.448
Yeah.

03:18.448 --> 03:19.344
C'mon boy, let's go.

03:20.068 --> 03:20.827
Come on.

03:21.482 --> 03:22.241
Come on.

03:22.241 --> 03:23.896
I don't think
he is yours.

03:25.724 --> 03:28.137
Look, if he's lost-

03:28.137 --> 03:29.689
then I'm entitled
to some reward.

03:29.689 --> 03:30.862
That's all I'm saying.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.482
Unbelievable.

03:34.413 --> 03:36.000
Sorry is there some
sort of problem here?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.103
No problem at all.

03:37.206 --> 03:38.310
Okay.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.172
You have
a nice day.

03:39.172 --> 03:40.034
What is it hey?

03:40.034 --> 03:41.344
Yeah.

03:42.827 --> 03:43.655
Okay buddy.

03:43.655 --> 03:44.344
Hey.

03:47.931 --> 03:49.448
What is that?

03:49.448 --> 03:50.310
Is that a note?

03:55.931 --> 03:57.413
I think there's
been a plane crash.

04:09.586 --> 04:10.310
Joe.

04:11.344 --> 04:12.689
A call is
coming through.

04:13.206 --> 04:14.034
Finally.

04:14.931 --> 04:15.931
Hello?

04:15.931 --> 04:19.103
Detective Sergeant
Sidney Scott, OPS.

04:19.103 --> 04:19.965
Charlie Hudson?

04:19.965 --> 04:20.655
Yeah.

04:21.517 --> 04:22.172
Well there's
someone here-

04:22.172 --> 04:23.241
who wants to
say hi to you!

04:23.241 --> 04:24.137
Rex!

04:25.448 --> 04:26.931
Buddy, I am
glad to see you.

04:29.517 --> 04:30.551
And Sarah Truong,
and Jesse Mills?

04:30.551 --> 04:31.482
Are they
with you too?

04:31.482 --> 04:33.344
When Rex
found us, he was alone.

04:33.344 --> 04:34.586
But he hada note.

04:34.586 --> 04:36.448
It said there's
been a plane crash.

04:37.137 --> 04:37.862
Plane crash?

04:37.862 --> 04:38.758
What are you
talking about?

04:42.482 --> 04:44.586
The note
said a plane crash.

04:44.586 --> 04:46.551
Flew approximately
15 minutes, southwest-

04:46.551 --> 04:47.310
Okay, you know what?

04:47.310 --> 04:48.586
It's too long.

04:48.586 --> 04:50.103
I'm going to send
you a picture!

04:54.551 --> 04:55.482
Three survivors.

04:55.482 --> 04:57.137
Two had blunt force
trauma to the abdomen.

04:57.137 --> 04:59.275
No immediate signs
of pneumothorax.

04:59.275 --> 05:01.275
Third with simple
distal fracture.

05:01.275 --> 05:03.724
Please alert Charlie Hudson
at SJPD to send assistance.

05:03.724 --> 05:06.206
It doesn't say anything
about who the survivors are.

05:06.206 --> 05:07.965
That's all the
information that I have.

05:07.965 --> 05:08.793
I'm sorry.

05:08.793 --> 05:09.827
We're going to
take off now.

05:09.827 --> 05:11.068
And we're going
to look for them.

05:11.758 --> 05:12.724
Please find them.

05:12.724 --> 05:14.241
We'll do our best, Detective.

05:14.241 --> 05:15.413
Okay everybody.

05:15.413 --> 05:16.655
Okay, Rex.

05:16.758 --> 05:18.103
Help us find them.

05:27.896 --> 05:29.896
This is Sarah's handwriting.

05:29.896 --> 05:32.241
Yeah so we know that she
did survive the plane crash.

05:32.241 --> 05:32.896
Yeah.

05:32.896 --> 05:33.551
For twenty-four hours.

05:33.551 --> 05:34.448
But-

05:34.448 --> 05:36.931
it doesn't say
anything about Jesse.

05:36.931 --> 05:37.862
Three survivors.

05:37.862 --> 05:38.931
They were all injured.

05:40.241 --> 05:42.068
Doesn't say who was on
the plane to begin with.

05:42.068 --> 05:44.137
What were they doing on
a plane anyway, damn it?

05:45.413 --> 05:47.000
Charlie, Rex has
help on the way.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.827
What route did you
take out, buddy?

06:07.517 --> 06:09.517
Do you have an estimate
of their location?

06:09.517 --> 06:10.896
A big estimate.

06:10.896 --> 06:12.310
There's no rescue signal.

06:13.379 --> 06:14.517
No flight record.

06:15.965 --> 06:17.517
It'll be like finding a
needle in a haystack.

06:39.551 --> 06:40.620
I mean listen-

06:40.620 --> 06:42.620
if you would have told me
forty-eight hours ago-

06:42.620 --> 06:44.724
that I'd crash a plane
and be performing surgery-

06:44.724 --> 06:47.551
You would have never
answered my voicemail.

06:48.517 --> 06:51.413
Crystal, I'm glad
I came running okay?

06:51.413 --> 06:53.965
I just wish I
didn't have to.

06:53.965 --> 06:55.448
How did you let
it get this bad?

06:57.931 --> 06:59.310
You really needed to
rob some guy's house?

06:59.310 --> 07:00.241
And for what?

07:00.241 --> 07:01.482
An iPad and
a Rolex?

07:01.482 --> 07:03.034
And then it
turns into us-

07:03.034 --> 07:04.758
getting almost gunned down-

07:04.758 --> 07:05.482
and shot to-

07:09.896 --> 07:11.517
Crystal how much
money is in there?

07:12.344 --> 07:13.655
It's a hundred thousand.

07:14.827 --> 07:15.586
You know.

07:16.793 --> 07:18.482
Just enough for all of my
and Nick's problems to just-

07:20.206 --> 07:20.931
go away.

07:22.551 --> 07:24.241
Jesse.

07:24.827 --> 07:25.482
Jesse.

07:25.482 --> 07:26.689
Hey!
Hey hey hey!

07:26.689 --> 07:28.931
Hey, you're going
to make it!

07:28.931 --> 07:29.793
Okay?

07:29.896 --> 07:32.310
If I don't
make it-

07:32.310 --> 07:34.965
you have
to find Rex.

07:37.758 --> 07:38.724
Tell Charlie-

07:38.724 --> 07:39.586
No no.

07:39.586 --> 07:40.482
You're going to
tell him yourself-

07:40.482 --> 07:41.379
when we get
home okay?

07:41.379 --> 07:42.793
That's what
you're going to do.

07:42.896 --> 07:44.655
There's no need for
last requests Sarah.

07:44.655 --> 07:47.172
Rex is going
to come back.

08:07.241 --> 08:08.310
Okay Rex.

08:08.310 --> 08:09.689
I think he's
got something.

08:09.689 --> 08:11.034
I think this
is the area.

08:11.034 --> 08:11.758
Copy.

08:11.758 --> 08:12.827
I'm going to spin
her around

08:12.827 --> 08:15.206
and put it down
in that clearing.

08:38.620 --> 08:40.896
I'll give them the coordinates
of where we dropped you off!

08:40.896 --> 08:44.034
But I recommend you
stay with us Detective!

08:44.034 --> 08:46.034
I have a
sat phone!

08:56.137 --> 08:57.551
We'll start
the ground search-

08:57.551 --> 08:59.034
in communication with air.

09:03.551 --> 09:04.655
Well, it's
you and me!

09:10.275 --> 09:11.068
Okay.

09:13.275 --> 09:14.310
Okay!

09:15.379 --> 09:17.275
Okay, I hope you know
where you're going.

09:45.655 --> 09:46.758
Okay.

09:49.551 --> 09:51.517
I don't know how Detective
Hudson keeps up with you.

09:55.137 --> 09:58.068
You have got to
be kidding me.

10:06.275 --> 10:07.172
Any word?

10:07.172 --> 10:08.482
Yeah, they've got a
chopper in the air.

10:08.482 --> 10:10.000
But nothing yet.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.206
I should have gone.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.413
Why Charlie?

10:12.413 --> 10:13.758
So I could have three officers
missing instead of two?

10:13.758 --> 10:14.793
No thank you.

10:14.793 --> 10:16.137
I think the folks out
there know the terrain-

10:16.137 --> 10:16.827
better than you do.

10:16.827 --> 10:17.896
They don't know
Rex as well.

10:19.724 --> 10:20.758
Listen Charlie.

10:21.517 --> 10:23.758
If he made his way to
them from the crash site-

10:23.758 --> 10:25.413
I'm sure he can
find his way back.

10:26.103 --> 10:26.827
Yeah.

10:29.206 --> 10:31.758
Did you talk to that Boyle
character about your old case?

10:33.241 --> 10:33.931
I did.

10:35.206 --> 10:35.931
And?

10:37.965 --> 10:39.793
He thinks I'm
chasing a ghost.

10:45.206 --> 10:46.758
Did I tell you that I
wasn't much of a dog person?

10:46.758 --> 10:47.896
Well I mean-

10:47.896 --> 10:49.793
It's not that I didn't
want to be as a kid.

10:49.793 --> 10:51.655
I mean honestly, who
doesn't want a puppy?

10:51.655 --> 10:52.793
Right?

10:52.793 --> 10:54.137
Okay, right.

10:54.137 --> 10:55.448
It's my parents!

10:55.448 --> 10:57.275
My parents were
not dog people!

10:57.275 --> 10:59.620
I don't even think they
were children people!

11:00.344 --> 11:01.068
Okay.

11:01.344 --> 11:02.310
Okay!

11:10.448 --> 11:11.137
Hey!

11:11.827 --> 11:12.724
Sarah [whispering]: Hey.

11:12.724 --> 11:13.620
Here.

11:13.620 --> 11:14.482
Oh my God!

11:14.482 --> 11:16.206
Oh, you're feverish.

11:16.206 --> 11:18.241
It's
probably infection.

11:18.241 --> 11:18.965
Here, get some water.

11:18.965 --> 11:19.758
Get some water.

11:21.172 --> 11:23.517
Oh Jesse.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.896
Jesse, you did good!

11:26.896 --> 11:28.241
I'm still here.

11:30.965 --> 11:34.413
Tell the medics push
IV antibiotics okay?

11:37.206 --> 11:38.172
Thank you.

11:38.172 --> 11:40.965
You did a damage
control laparotomy.

11:42.103 --> 11:44.896
Sarah what if the medics
don't arrive in time?

11:47.448 --> 11:48.689
Have faith, Jesse.

11:50.103 --> 11:51.206
Rex will make it.

11:54.379 --> 11:55.413
Hey!

12:00.103 --> 12:01.172
Rex!

12:01.758 --> 12:02.827
Rex yes!

12:04.103 --> 12:05.551
Hey tell the folks in
St. John's I've found them!

12:05.551 --> 12:06.482
All three survivors!

12:07.172 --> 12:08.344
Good boy!

12:08.586 --> 12:09.620
Hey!

12:10.689 --> 12:12.689
Oh I'm so
happy to see you!

12:14.413 --> 12:15.379
Hey folks.

12:15.379 --> 12:17.586
Detective Sidney Scott, OPS.

12:17.586 --> 12:18.448
Hi!

12:18.448 --> 12:20.310
This is quite a dog
you've got here!

12:21.000 --> 12:22.034
You must be
Jesse and Sarah.

12:22.034 --> 12:22.965
Yeah.

12:26.689 --> 12:28.413
You must be
Crystal Mills.

12:28.413 --> 12:29.413
We've been
looking for you.

12:46.241 --> 12:47.310
Jesse.

12:47.310 --> 12:48.379
Yeah, we're okay.

12:48.379 --> 12:50.931
They told us Sarah's been
taken to the hospital.

12:50.931 --> 12:52.103
Yeah, Sarah's
going to be okay.

12:52.103 --> 12:53.172
Look.

12:53.172 --> 12:54.344
She had some internal
bleeding after the crash.

12:54.344 --> 12:56.689
She made me operate.

12:56.689 --> 12:57.586
What?

12:57.586 --> 12:58.724
What the hell are
you talking about?

12:58.724 --> 13:00.068
Look, a shooter
was after us okay?

13:00.068 --> 13:01.172
We couldn't
get to the car.

13:01.172 --> 13:01.862
There was a plane.

13:01.862 --> 13:03.379
So we took it.

13:03.379 --> 13:04.275
Let me
talk to her.

13:04.275 --> 13:05.344
She's in surgery.

13:05.344 --> 13:07.551
Look, I've
got to go guys.

13:07.551 --> 13:09.448
I need to check
on my sister.

13:09.448 --> 13:10.482
Talk to you soon.

13:21.344 --> 13:23.724
Crystal, let me tell you why
we've placed you under arrest.

13:23.724 --> 13:25.344
Look is this really
necessary right now?

13:25.344 --> 13:26.896
I just watched my boyfriend
get shot and killed.

13:26.896 --> 13:27.862
And I thought-

13:27.862 --> 13:29.344
we were all gonna die
in a plane crash.

13:29.931 --> 13:30.862
It's been a lot.

13:33.448 --> 13:35.620
Around 10 am yesterday-

13:35.620 --> 13:37.931
there was a break-in at a
residence on Lakeshore Drive.

13:37.931 --> 13:39.620
I didn't break
in anywhere.

13:39.620 --> 13:41.206
There was
blood at the scene.

13:41.206 --> 13:43.206
And tests are going to
show it belonged to Nick.

13:43.206 --> 13:46.103
And we also have witnesses
that place you at the scene-

13:46.103 --> 13:46.931
in a car.

13:48.172 --> 13:49.551
But what I actually
really want to know-

13:49.551 --> 13:52.344
is why did you and Nick
choose this specific house?

13:52.344 --> 13:54.103
Nick picked the house.

13:54.103 --> 13:55.689
Nick
picked the house.

13:55.689 --> 13:56.724
Mmmm.

13:56.724 --> 13:58.931
Did Nick have a problem
with Basal Mining Group?

13:58.931 --> 14:00.206
No.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.724
Did Nick ever mention
the name Daniel Scott?

14:02.724 --> 14:04.137
No.

14:04.137 --> 14:05.620
Did Nick bring the
gun to the house-

14:05.620 --> 14:07.241
with a purpose other
than robbery, Crystal?

14:07.241 --> 14:09.793
We didn't
have a gun.

14:09.793 --> 14:11.137
The weapon
that he used-

14:11.137 --> 14:13.068
to murder Bianca Cooper.

14:13.068 --> 14:13.931
I'm sorry.

14:13.931 --> 14:15.379
I'm not feeling
very well.

14:15.379 --> 14:16.310
I-

14:16.310 --> 14:17.551
Do you mind if-

14:17.551 --> 14:18.896
if we just
take a minute?

14:18.896 --> 14:19.862
Please?

14:25.241 --> 14:26.793
Yeah, a minute.

14:33.068 --> 14:33.758
Crystal.

14:33.758 --> 14:35.310
What is all this
about a gun?

14:35.310 --> 14:36.000
I don't know!

14:36.275 --> 14:36.896
I don't know!

14:36.896 --> 14:37.758
We didn't
have a gun!

14:37.758 --> 14:39.241
Do you know
what that means?

14:40.068 --> 14:42.241
If she was shot and didn't
die of a blow to the head-

14:42.241 --> 14:43.724
it means that Nick
didn't kill anyone.

14:44.413 --> 14:45.068
Are you sure?

14:45.068 --> 14:46.206
Yeah yeah.

14:46.206 --> 14:47.655
You've got to get that
backpack out of here right now.

14:47.655 --> 14:49.517
No, you need to turn
it in and tell the truth.

14:49.517 --> 14:50.724
Everything.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.068
Not until we find out who
actually killed that woman.

14:52.068 --> 14:53.379
Because if they
find that first-

14:53.379 --> 14:55.448
there's no convincing
them that Nick didn't do it.

14:58.241 --> 14:59.206
Come on please.

15:15.034 --> 15:15.965
Detective Scott!

15:18.448 --> 15:19.413
Look.

15:19.413 --> 15:21.172
I know you need
answers okay?

15:21.172 --> 15:22.206
She wants to cooperate;
she's scared.

15:22.206 --> 15:23.275
But I want
you to know-

15:23.275 --> 15:24.482
that you're looking
for a different killer.

15:24.482 --> 15:25.862
Are you here
as a cop?

15:25.862 --> 15:26.862
Or a brother?

15:27.448 --> 15:28.275
I have to
be both.

15:29.034 --> 15:30.068
And you need
to find out

15:30.068 --> 15:31.862
whoever the hell was
trying to kill us out there.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.206
Okay, well we're headed
to the missile site.

15:33.206 --> 15:34.931
We're going to gather
any evidence we can.

15:34.931 --> 15:36.965
And we're going to try to
identify who attacked you.

15:38.000 --> 15:38.862
You know,
Rex was there.

15:38.862 --> 15:40.413
He saw the shooter.

15:40.413 --> 15:42.000
He might be able to
help you track him.

15:43.103 --> 15:43.758
Okay.

15:43.758 --> 15:45.344
You want to help
me out, Rex?

15:47.241 --> 15:48.724
You know, while
we're gone-

15:48.724 --> 15:50.448
maybe you can convince
your sister to tell us why

15:50.448 --> 15:52.000
she and her boyfriend
went to the Cooper's house.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.655
Come on, Rex.

16:05.068 --> 16:05.931
Sarah.

16:05.931 --> 16:06.793
Good to hear
your voice.

16:06.793 --> 16:09.000
Did they catch
the shooter yet?

16:09.000 --> 16:10.068
Not yet.

16:10.068 --> 16:11.310
When can you
come home?

16:11.310 --> 16:13.172
I'll be released
later today.

16:13.172 --> 16:14.379
But Charlie.

16:14.379 --> 16:17.275
I have to see things through
with Jesse and his sister.

16:17.275 --> 16:18.275
I get it.

16:18.793 --> 16:19.965
Be safe.

16:27.758 --> 16:29.137
It's going
to be a long ride.

16:29.241 --> 16:30.862
We've got some
time to kill.

16:32.344 --> 16:34.655
What made you decide
to become a cop?

16:34.655 --> 16:35.724
Was it the benefits?

16:38.344 --> 16:39.689
I know, I know.

16:39.689 --> 16:40.965
You really just
want to help people.

16:40.965 --> 16:41.931
I know.

16:41.931 --> 16:42.827
You're a good boy.

16:43.620 --> 16:45.137
How do you feel
about Snoop Dog?

16:49.827 --> 16:51.862
Um- should he be
that close to the body?

16:51.862 --> 16:53.344
Yeah we usually bring
in K-9 afterwards.

16:53.344 --> 16:55.448
So if forensics
finds dog hair-

16:55.448 --> 16:56.896
just tell them
to eliminate it.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.344
He was shot three
times in the back.

17:00.344 --> 17:02.103
That's exactly what
the witness said we'd find.

17:02.103 --> 17:03.931
Well someone came
looking for Crystal and Nick.

17:03.931 --> 17:05.482
And they weren't
fooling around.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.034
It's a cigarette butt.

17:14.931 --> 17:16.620
You think that belongs to
the victim or the shooter?

17:17.344 --> 17:18.931
Let's find out.

17:18.931 --> 17:19.620
Yeah.

17:30.896 --> 17:32.068
He shouldn't be touching
anything in here.

17:32.068 --> 17:32.896
Whoa!

17:32.896 --> 17:34.517
Hey is that what
you want us to find?

17:36.655 --> 17:37.689
All right, just-

17:37.689 --> 17:39.275
There's a
bag in here.

17:43.241 --> 17:44.379
Good boy Rex.

17:44.379 --> 17:46.448
That's Cooper's
stolen electronics!

17:52.068 --> 17:52.827
What?

17:57.551 --> 17:58.862
That's a .38.

17:58.862 --> 18:00.620
Wait- Sid you don't
need to see that- No!

18:00.827 --> 18:01.965
Daniel!

18:03.965 --> 18:04.758
Daniel!

18:04.758 --> 18:05.724
I know.

18:05.724 --> 18:07.896
Your husband was
killed with a .38.

18:07.896 --> 18:09.793
Every single one we've
found in the last six weeks-

18:09.793 --> 18:10.482
we've checked.

18:12.827 --> 18:13.586
Can we bag this?

18:13.689 --> 18:14.896
Come
on Rex, let's go.

18:18.482 --> 18:19.931
Detective Scott asked you
why you chose that house.

18:19.931 --> 18:21.448
Yeah, because she's
frickin' obsessed.

18:21.448 --> 18:22.586
She's right, Crystal.

18:23.586 --> 18:24.275
Look.

18:25.517 --> 18:26.758
You didn't just go in there
for a random smash-and grab.

18:26.758 --> 18:28.275
You had to know what
you were looking for.

18:28.275 --> 18:28.965
Oh yeah?

18:28.965 --> 18:30.413
And how do
you figure that?

18:30.413 --> 18:31.482
Well it's not normal-

18:31.482 --> 18:33.241
for people to have that
much money in their house.

18:33.241 --> 18:34.655
You're acting
like a narc!

18:34.655 --> 18:35.862
What do you
want me to say?

18:35.862 --> 18:38.137
She asked you about
a Daniel Scott.

18:39.344 --> 18:40.206
I looked him up.

18:40.206 --> 18:41.000
Okay?

18:41.931 --> 18:42.655
He was her husband.

18:43.724 --> 18:45.241
And he was shot and
killed two months ago.

18:45.241 --> 18:46.965
The case is
still unsolved.

18:47.482 --> 18:48.620
Jesse.

18:48.620 --> 18:52.379
You don't think that I had
anything to do with that?

18:52.379 --> 18:54.000
No it doesn't matter
what I think okay?

18:54.793 --> 18:57.551
If she believes
that you or Nick

18:57.551 --> 18:59.413
had anything to do with
her husband's murder-

18:59.413 --> 19:01.827
I can't protect you from
whatever comes next.

19:14.724 --> 19:16.000
Yeah I
don't know.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.724
I mean, I believed Crystal when
she told me about the robbery.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.344
But I think she knows
more than she's saying.

19:19.344 --> 19:21.344
Surely after everything
that's happened-

19:21.344 --> 19:23.620
she must realize that she
needs to tell you the truth.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.482
Yeah I think
she's just scared.

19:27.758 --> 19:28.655
What are you doing?

19:29.793 --> 19:30.793
Crystal told us Nick believed
Bianca Cooper died-

19:30.793 --> 19:31.862
from a blow
to the head.

19:31.862 --> 19:33.655
And Detective Scott
says she was shot.

19:34.448 --> 19:35.172
Yeah, right.

19:35.172 --> 19:36.137
Well they can't
both be right.

19:36.137 --> 19:37.689
I want to take a
look at that body.

19:37.689 --> 19:39.172
Detective Huang?

19:39.172 --> 19:39.827
Hi.

19:39.827 --> 19:40.724
It's Sarah Truong.

19:41.758 --> 19:43.758
I'm wondering if you can
help me with something.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.482
Rex found
this at the missile site.

19:51.620 --> 19:52.793
That's not ours.

19:52.793 --> 19:56.241
I've never seen
that before.

19:56.586 --> 19:58.241
All of these items-

19:58.241 --> 20:00.482
they were stolen from
the Cooper residence.

20:00.482 --> 20:01.344
You recognize
any of them?

20:02.620 --> 20:03.448
Crystal?

20:04.068 --> 20:04.827
No.

20:06.517 --> 20:07.758
A .38.

20:07.758 --> 20:10.586
Same calibre of weapon that
was used to kill Bianca Cooper.

20:10.586 --> 20:11.758
Nick didn't
have a gun.

20:11.758 --> 20:13.137
I told you
that lady fell.

20:13.137 --> 20:14.344
And she hit
her head.

20:14.344 --> 20:15.896
You said that
Rex tracked this?

20:15.896 --> 20:16.551
Mmm-hmm.

20:16.551 --> 20:17.758
From a cigarette butt.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.793
We're testing it
from Nick's DNA.

20:19.793 --> 20:21.034
Well I will save
you the trouble.

20:21.034 --> 20:22.206
Nick didn't even smoke!

20:22.896 --> 20:24.413
I think the shooter
planted this bag.

20:24.413 --> 20:27.275
And you know this
because the dog told you?

20:27.275 --> 20:28.310
He knows
what he's doing.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.310
He is pretty smart.

20:34.034 --> 20:35.793
The coroner places Bianca
Cooper's time of death

20:35.793 --> 20:36.758
between 8 am
and noon.

20:37.931 --> 20:39.172
Uh- that's right.

20:39.172 --> 20:41.793
Which matches witness accounts
of intruders at the house-

20:41.793 --> 20:42.793
just before 10 am.

20:43.724 --> 20:44.379
Why?

20:45.689 --> 20:46.862
What is it you're
looking for?

20:48.137 --> 20:49.000
This.

20:49.793 --> 20:50.413
You see it?

20:50.413 --> 20:52.586
Right in there.

20:52.586 --> 20:55.068
A contusion
under the hairline.

20:55.068 --> 20:56.206
Crystal Mills said-

20:56.206 --> 20:57.379
that her boyfriend
struggled with the victim.

20:57.379 --> 20:58.862
And she fell.

21:03.551 --> 21:05.310
He thought that
that's what killed her.

21:06.379 --> 21:08.275
No I'm pretty sure
it was the gunshot.

21:10.793 --> 21:11.931
Yes but this bruise-

21:11.931 --> 21:13.827
on Bianca Cooper's
head is well developed.

21:13.827 --> 21:16.103
So some time elapsed between the
head injury and the gunshot.

21:17.517 --> 21:18.482
How much time?

21:19.275 --> 21:21.482
Uh- I'd estimate
two hours.

21:22.689 --> 21:24.655
Oh no.

21:24.965 --> 21:25.724
No no no!

21:26.758 --> 21:28.344
I assumed it
was the intruders!

21:29.689 --> 21:31.482
I've had the wrong
time of death all along.

21:37.137 --> 21:38.000
How are you doing?

21:42.275 --> 21:43.206
Stuck.

21:43.724 --> 21:46.000
It's because you're
a good cop Charlie.

21:47.241 --> 21:48.344
And a great detective.

21:52.862 --> 21:54.172
Even if I can't
bring her home?

21:56.965 --> 21:57.827
That's the job.

21:58.758 --> 22:00.275
Not everyone gets
to come home.

22:02.551 --> 22:03.310
And when
that happens-

22:03.310 --> 22:04.655
we need to know
where to place it-

22:05.068 --> 22:07.206
how to continue
to move forward-

22:08.655 --> 22:09.689
how to keep
ourselves safe-

22:09.689 --> 22:11.965
so that we can be good
for the next little girl-

22:11.965 --> 22:13.862
for the next family-

22:14.413 --> 22:16.413
for the next person
that needs us.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.000
I don't know how
to bury a ghost.

22:24.931 --> 22:26.310
We pinned the time of
Bianca Cooper's death-

22:26.310 --> 22:27.379
to the time
of the break-in.

22:27.379 --> 22:29.206
Well that was
based on the time-

22:29.206 --> 22:31.724
that witnesses placed Crystal's
car at the Cooper house.

22:31.724 --> 22:33.275
But if I'm right-

22:33.275 --> 22:34.310
she was shot
by someone else.

22:35.068 --> 22:35.862
After-

22:35.862 --> 22:37.413
Nick and Crystal
fled the scene.

22:37.413 --> 22:40.551
Okay, we found the electronics
and gun at Crystal's camp.

22:40.551 --> 22:42.000
They would have been
easy enough to plant.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.344
Right, so say the
shooter planted the gun.

22:44.344 --> 22:45.758
Can't
be Tim Cooper-

22:45.758 --> 22:48.310
because he was talking to us
at the time you were attacked.

22:48.310 --> 22:49.241
Our connection between-

22:49.241 --> 22:50.896
Crystal and the Coopers
is Wayne Kinney.

22:50.896 --> 22:52.689
I'm going to go
talk to him now.

22:52.689 --> 22:54.517
Does this
clear Crystal Mills-

22:54.517 --> 22:56.379
in the matter of
Bianca Cooper's death?

22:56.379 --> 22:58.172
Well there will be
charges for the break-in.

22:58.172 --> 22:58.965
So-

22:58.965 --> 23:00.275
make sure she
remains available.

23:01.896 --> 23:02.551
Let's go.

23:18.448 --> 23:19.586
I'm
not quite sure-

23:19.586 --> 23:21.137
I understand what you're
suggesting, Detective.

23:21.137 --> 23:22.793
I'm just saying we've
found a connection-

23:22.793 --> 23:26.344
between you and the suspects
in Bianca Cooper's murder.

23:27.379 --> 23:29.241
What kind of connection?

23:29.241 --> 23:30.793
Well one of them worked
for the janitorial company-

23:30.793 --> 23:32.068
that cleans your offices.

23:32.172 --> 23:32.758
Oh.

23:34.517 --> 23:35.689
It's a small town.

23:35.689 --> 23:36.965
Oh!

23:36.965 --> 23:37.793
Yeah!

23:37.793 --> 23:39.103
But you've been here
your whole life!

23:39.103 --> 23:40.551
Uh, yeah.

23:40.551 --> 23:42.172
Except for a stint
in the military.

23:42.793 --> 23:43.724
Afghanistan.

23:45.344 --> 23:46.793
Can you account for
your whereabouts-

23:46.793 --> 23:48.068
the last couple
of days?

23:48.068 --> 23:51.206
As you can imagine, my work
takes me all over the place so-

23:51.206 --> 23:52.068
Mmm.

23:53.103 --> 23:53.862
I'm curious.

23:53.862 --> 23:55.448
I was under
the impression-

23:55.448 --> 23:58.689
that you had a pretty
good suspect already.

23:58.689 --> 24:01.620
Well, good isn't airtight.

24:04.034 --> 24:05.344
You know, I
think Daniel-

24:06.931 --> 24:09.068
he'd want you to enjoy
the life you have left.

24:11.172 --> 24:12.620
And your beautiful home.

24:13.724 --> 24:15.827
Your reputation
in this community.

24:17.310 --> 24:20.103
I think Daniel would want
you to leave this alone.

24:21.206 --> 24:21.862
Hey?

24:24.206 --> 24:25.620
Just take care
of yourself Sid.

24:25.620 --> 24:26.586
Hey?

24:33.344 --> 24:36.724
Thank you again
for getting me out.

24:37.517 --> 24:38.758
Lucky thing my
brother's got pull-

24:38.758 --> 24:39.448
with the cops!

24:39.448 --> 24:40.931
Okay, it's not
about pull.

24:40.931 --> 24:42.275
Sarah and Rex
found evidence.

24:42.413 --> 24:43.793
Ah, my heroes.

24:44.758 --> 24:45.655
Both of you.

24:45.758 --> 24:46.655
Look.

24:46.655 --> 24:48.275
The evidence clears
you of murder charges.

24:48.275 --> 24:49.862
But you need to tell
me about the money.

24:49.862 --> 24:51.172
Uh, you know what?

24:51.172 --> 24:54.172
I think I just going to
go home to my own place.

24:54.172 --> 24:54.827
Ahh!

24:54.827 --> 24:55.517
Don't!

24:55.896 --> 24:56.551
You can't keep it.

24:56.551 --> 24:57.310
Why not?

24:57.310 --> 24:58.379
Because it's stolen.

24:58.379 --> 25:00.517
But what if somebody
else stole it first?

25:00.517 --> 25:02.379
Probably from some
big, rich company-

25:02.379 --> 25:04.137
that can afford
to lose it anyway.

25:04.137 --> 25:06.275
It's not so wrong
what I did!

25:06.275 --> 25:07.068
God!

25:08.034 --> 25:09.896
Don't look at
me like that.

25:11.172 --> 25:13.931
So Detective Scott
was halfway there.

25:13.931 --> 25:16.000
We did go-

25:16.000 --> 25:16.965
to Cooper's place-

25:16.965 --> 25:18.206
because we knew the
money would be there.

25:18.206 --> 25:19.068
How did you know?

25:19.655 --> 25:20.275
Okay.

25:20.275 --> 25:21.137
Yeah so-

25:21.137 --> 25:23.379
I clean this Kinney
guy's office.

25:23.379 --> 25:25.931
Kinney was always
having these-

25:25.931 --> 25:26.862
hi-larious-

25:26.862 --> 25:28.482
moustache-twirly phone
conversations-

25:28.482 --> 25:29.482
after hours.

25:29.482 --> 25:30.517
About what?

25:31.172 --> 25:31.793
Okay.

25:31.793 --> 25:32.482
So-

25:36.275 --> 25:37.517
Kinney has the contract-

25:37.517 --> 25:39.724
to clean Basal Mining's
waste runoff.

25:39.724 --> 25:41.413
Like big money.

25:41.413 --> 25:42.517
Okay, all the fries.

25:42.517 --> 25:43.724
Yeah I get it.

25:43.724 --> 25:46.482
Yeah, all the fries buys you
a clean mining operation.

25:47.241 --> 25:49.275
But lets just say you
don't clean very well.

25:50.068 --> 25:51.068
Then it only costs-

25:54.586 --> 25:56.068
Basal would figure
out pretty quickly-

25:56.068 --> 25:58.000
that their runoff wasn't
being cleaned up properly.

25:58.000 --> 25:58.965
Oh yeah!

25:58.965 --> 26:01.275
But there's still plenty
of money left over-

26:01.275 --> 26:03.034
to keep people's
mouths shut.

26:03.034 --> 26:03.896
And Tim Cooper-

26:03.896 --> 26:05.068
being the head of
local operations.

26:05.068 --> 26:06.275
He would be
in on it too.

26:06.275 --> 26:07.482
He sure is!

26:07.482 --> 26:09.793
And then he'd have to launder
the money he was stealing.

26:09.793 --> 26:11.620
Kinney helped him
out with that, too!

26:11.620 --> 26:13.689
They talked about it.

26:13.689 --> 26:16.827
That's how I knew there
was cash at the house.

26:16.827 --> 26:17.965
You know-

26:17.965 --> 26:19.206
you could've just said
money laundering and fraud.

26:19.206 --> 26:20.896
I mean, I explain these
concepts for a living.

26:20.896 --> 26:21.827
Yeah so
you get it.

26:21.827 --> 26:22.620
Yeah.

26:22.620 --> 26:23.448
Yeah!

26:23.448 --> 26:24.448
What is the harm-

26:24.448 --> 26:25.482
in keeping money-

26:25.482 --> 26:27.517
that was already stolen
in the first place?

26:27.517 --> 26:31.103
The money is evidence
in a murder investigation!

26:31.103 --> 26:31.965
Maybe even in
another one!

26:31.965 --> 26:32.689
That's the harm, Crystal

26:32.689 --> 26:34.000
I'm going to
get out of here.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.448
And you're going to tell them
exactly what I just told you.

26:37.103 --> 26:37.965
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:37.965 --> 26:39.344
And lose my job?

26:39.344 --> 26:40.413
That's not how it-

26:41.758 --> 26:42.655
Rex?

26:52.586 --> 26:53.689
Rex!

26:54.517 --> 26:55.620
Rex come back!

27:06.241 --> 27:07.482
Rex!

27:11.655 --> 27:12.689
Rex!

27:20.793 --> 27:21.413
Good boy.

27:21.413 --> 27:22.206
Hey! Hi!

27:22.206 --> 27:23.103
Don't scare
us like that!

27:23.103 --> 27:23.758
Oh my God!

27:24.413 --> 27:25.241
Okay.

27:25.241 --> 27:26.172
Crystal, we're
going to the cops.

27:26.172 --> 27:26.827
What?

27:26.827 --> 27:27.689
We're going
to the cops!

27:27.689 --> 27:28.379
No!

27:34.379 --> 27:36.068
This is why you
went to the Cooper house?

27:36.068 --> 27:38.103
How did you know there
was this much money there?

27:39.241 --> 27:39.896
Well I-

27:39.896 --> 27:41.137
Ah!

27:41.137 --> 27:43.413
Cooper and Kinney were siphoning
off Basal's cleaning fund.

27:43.413 --> 27:44.758
And Kinney was
laundering the money.

27:44.758 --> 27:46.275
Crystal you discovered this-

27:46.275 --> 27:48.172
while you were cleaning
Mr. Kinney's offices?

27:48.172 --> 27:50.241
I learned that there
were regular pickups.

27:50.241 --> 27:52.034
Pretty much the same day
of the week every time.

27:52.034 --> 27:52.724
So-

27:52.724 --> 27:54.034
Nick and I had
a good idea-

27:54.034 --> 27:55.620
of when the cash
would be at the house.

27:55.620 --> 27:57.862
You actually saw Tim Cooper
speaking with Mr. Kinney-

27:57.862 --> 27:58.896
about the money exchange?

27:58.896 --> 28:00.344
Well sometimes it
was phone calls.

28:00.344 --> 28:02.724
And sometimes Mr. Cooper
came by the office.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.103
But we followed
him one time-

28:04.103 --> 28:04.965
one time-

28:05.068 --> 28:06.034
one time-

28:06.034 --> 28:07.724
we followed him.

28:07.724 --> 28:10.206
And that's how we learned
where Mr. Cooper's house was.

28:12.241 --> 28:13.551
Do you know
this man?

28:16.413 --> 28:18.172
No, I never
saw him.

28:23.482 --> 28:24.448
One time.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.413
It was one time.

28:28.310 --> 28:30.172
Rex is really
disappointed in you.

28:35.241 --> 28:36.586
Thank you for
meeting me.

28:37.241 --> 28:39.586
You called because
you're ready to listen?

28:41.586 --> 28:42.517
What changed?

28:43.724 --> 28:46.310
How did the waste get
into the water at your place?

28:49.655 --> 28:50.827
My place is
on the river.

28:52.103 --> 28:53.275
Basal Mining-

28:53.275 --> 28:54.344
they process
their waste-

28:54.344 --> 28:56.137
and they bury it in a
site upstream from us.

28:56.137 --> 28:57.310
Mm-hmm?

28:57.310 --> 28:59.724
The groundwater from their
burial goes into the river.

28:59.724 --> 29:02.034
And the mine claims that
they clean the waste

29:02.034 --> 29:02.896
before they bury it?

29:03.965 --> 29:05.137
Yeah.

29:05.137 --> 29:07.586
And their lawyers swamp me
with reports that prove it.

29:09.206 --> 29:10.862
My husband
wrote the reports.

29:11.551 --> 29:14.172
How do you think they
could fake the results?

29:14.172 --> 29:17.206
Well now you're asking the
right questions, Colombo.

29:18.413 --> 29:20.103
Why would they
risk so much-

29:20.103 --> 29:21.482
the entire business-

29:21.482 --> 29:22.586
the liability-

29:22.586 --> 29:23.655
harm people?

29:25.482 --> 29:29.551
People do all kinds of things
for money, Detective.

29:29.551 --> 29:30.793
Maybe even your husband.

29:55.482 --> 29:56.517
Let's take a trip.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.379
What do you think?

29:58.379 --> 29:59.172
Italy?

29:59.172 --> 30:00.655
We can't afford it!

30:00.655 --> 30:01.689
We just bought
a new house!

30:01.689 --> 30:03.103
We can't afford
to go on a trip.

30:03.103 --> 30:03.965
You forget.

30:03.965 --> 30:05.689
Your husband's
a wise investor.

30:25.241 --> 30:26.586
Elvis was right
all along.

30:27.655 --> 30:28.896
People were getting sick.

30:30.517 --> 30:32.965
The mine has been
burying pollution for years.

30:34.275 --> 30:35.448
You think
Daniel found out?

30:36.000 --> 30:37.724
Then one of them killed
him to keep it quiet?

30:42.241 --> 30:44.137
I mean they may have killed
him to keep him quiet.

30:44.137 --> 30:45.206
But he didn't
just find out.

30:45.793 --> 30:47.517
Daniel might have
been in on it.

30:47.517 --> 30:50.586
I have been going
about this all wrong.

30:50.586 --> 30:51.413
I'm telling you-

30:51.413 --> 30:52.862
I didn't even know
my own husband.

30:52.862 --> 30:53.517
Are you-?

30:53.517 --> 30:54.206
Hey!

30:55.103 --> 30:56.000
Uh-

30:56.000 --> 30:57.793
Tim Cooper was at
the office all day.

30:57.793 --> 30:59.000
His staff confirm it.

30:59.000 --> 31:00.103
Um-

31:00.103 --> 31:02.137
Are they sure he didn't step
out for part of the day?

31:02.724 --> 31:04.344
Well I'm looking at
cell tower records-

31:04.344 --> 31:05.413
to see if I
can confirm.

31:05.413 --> 31:07.275
But it's going to
take some time.

31:07.275 --> 31:08.620
Okay Wayne
is ex-military.

31:08.620 --> 31:09.620
He's absolutely our shooter.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.000
But there
is no way-

31:11.000 --> 31:13.241
that Tim Cooper
didn't know about this.

31:13.241 --> 31:14.758
I've got to
make him talk.

31:15.103 --> 31:16.413
Well you'll
need backup.

31:50.965 --> 31:52.206
Hey.

31:52.206 --> 31:53.586
Drink, Detective?

31:53.586 --> 31:54.275
Yeah.

31:54.275 --> 31:55.379
Neat.

31:58.896 --> 32:01.620
We found the electronics you
said were stolen from the house.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.689
So then you have enough
to arrest Bianca's killer.

32:05.689 --> 32:06.586
Yeah, I think so.

32:06.586 --> 32:07.413
But it's funny.

32:07.413 --> 32:08.517
We also found-

32:08.517 --> 32:10.620
the money that you said
was stolen from the house.

32:11.689 --> 32:13.000
You lied Tim.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.551
You had to know it was
going to come back to you.

32:18.034 --> 32:20.793
That girl's partner broke
into my house, Sidney.

32:22.034 --> 32:23.103
Killed my wife.

32:24.241 --> 32:24.965
Yeah.

32:24.965 --> 32:25.862
You really buy
her story?

32:25.862 --> 32:28.172
Because a jury won't.

32:28.172 --> 32:29.620
Nick Weller
didn't kill Bianca.

32:29.620 --> 32:32.000
But I believe that you
know who actually did.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.103
What's your
play here, Sid?

32:59.000 --> 32:59.724
Hmm?

33:00.620 --> 33:02.000
Are you going
to arrest me?

33:03.862 --> 33:05.413
Or do you want
me to cut you in?

33:05.413 --> 33:07.655
No, what I want is for you
to you to help me catch-

33:07.655 --> 33:09.586
who actually killed
Bianca and Daniel.

33:11.172 --> 33:13.172
I'm still exposed Sid.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.620
Will I still go
to jail for fraud?

33:16.620 --> 33:18.827
Maybe we can help
you get a deal right?

33:18.827 --> 33:20.758
If you give up
Wayne Kinney.

33:20.758 --> 33:22.896
He's not giving
you anything.

33:27.344 --> 33:30.206
We've come too far
to go down now Sid.

33:37.206 --> 33:38.517
How much do
the cops know?

33:39.482 --> 33:40.137
Eh?

33:40.137 --> 33:40.793
Nothing.

33:40.793 --> 33:42.310
Honestly- no.

33:42.310 --> 33:43.000
Nobody knows.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.000
I came here alone.

33:44.000 --> 33:46.241
Well that was stupid.

33:46.241 --> 33:49.551
You're still trying to
protect Daniel's reputation.

33:50.275 --> 33:51.827
I'm trying to
figure out how it is-

33:51.827 --> 33:54.103
that you actually managed
to talk him into this.

33:54.103 --> 33:55.310
I didn't
need to!

33:55.655 --> 33:56.379
It was his idea.

33:56.379 --> 33:57.068
No.

33:57.068 --> 33:58.896
No, he wasn't
that way.

33:58.896 --> 34:01.931
God don't be
so naive Sid!

34:01.931 --> 34:03.724
You ever take
a look around-

34:03.724 --> 34:04.620
at your big,
beautiful house?

34:04.620 --> 34:05.586
Okay Tim, stop.

34:05.586 --> 34:06.965
And wonder where
it all came from?

34:06.965 --> 34:07.689
Tim stop!

34:07.689 --> 34:08.551
Stop talking!

34:08.551 --> 34:09.620
No, she
wants to know-

34:09.620 --> 34:10.827
the truth!

34:10.827 --> 34:12.068
It's not going to
make a difference!

34:12.068 --> 34:13.793
So if he was so in
on it, what changed?

34:13.793 --> 34:14.551
Why kill him?

34:17.965 --> 34:20.241
Elvis Migwans
spooked him, so-

34:20.241 --> 34:23.241
Daniel
lost his nerve.

34:24.655 --> 34:27.965
He threatened to go public if
we didn't clean up the water.

34:27.965 --> 34:29.620
It would have
cost us millions.

34:29.620 --> 34:31.379
Millions you'd
already stolen.

34:31.379 --> 34:32.689
That's enough.

34:32.689 --> 34:34.344
Daniel, too.

34:35.896 --> 34:37.103
Don't you forget that.

34:38.103 --> 34:39.586
And he liked
having a secret-

34:39.586 --> 34:41.137
stealing all that money.

34:41.137 --> 34:42.896
I think it was
fun for him.

34:42.896 --> 34:45.206
And he liked
showing it off too.

34:45.206 --> 34:46.344
Didn't he Sid?

34:48.379 --> 34:52.310
Do you really want everyone
to know the truth?

34:52.310 --> 34:54.689
Don't you
understand Tim?

34:54.689 --> 34:57.137
The truth always
comes out.

35:00.448 --> 35:01.310
Ughh!

35:07.965 --> 35:09.034
Uhh!

35:09.034 --> 35:10.310
Ughh!

35:14.137 --> 35:15.482
Did you kill Daniel?

35:15.482 --> 35:17.827
Or did you have him do
your dirty work for you?

35:19.689 --> 35:21.241
I made Daniel rich.

35:22.068 --> 35:23.275
And you too!

35:25.034 --> 35:26.137
Who shot him?

35:27.275 --> 35:29.413
He was going to
expose me Sid.

35:32.000 --> 35:33.793
I had to
kill him.

35:36.482 --> 35:37.448
I've got the confession!

35:37.448 --> 35:38.172
Clear!

35:38.275 --> 35:40.413
Don't move Cooper!

35:40.413 --> 35:41.103
Hold it right there!

35:41.103 --> 35:41.793
It's over!

35:41.896 --> 35:42.448
It's over!

35:42.448 --> 35:43.137
Cuff him!

35:43.137 --> 35:44.000
He's down there!

35:44.827 --> 35:45.931
Tim Cooper.

35:45.931 --> 35:47.275
You're under arrest for
the murder of Bianca Cooper-

35:47.275 --> 35:48.551
and Daniel Scott.

35:48.551 --> 35:49.724
You need not
say anything.

35:49.724 --> 35:52.172
Anything you say
may be used as evidence.

35:53.275 --> 35:54.689
You have the right to
retain and instruct counsel-

35:54.689 --> 35:55.620
without delay.

35:55.620 --> 35:57.000
Do you understand?

36:09.068 --> 36:10.206
Good work Detective.

36:20.896 --> 36:23.655
One of the strange things
about living in this world-

36:23.655 --> 36:25.689
is that it is only
now and then

36:25.689 --> 36:27.620
that one is quite sure
one is going to live-

36:27.620 --> 36:30.000
forever and
ever and ever.

36:31.034 --> 36:33.137
One knows it because-

36:41.758 --> 36:43.551
I have something
for you.

36:47.689 --> 36:48.517
What's this?

36:49.310 --> 36:50.758
You were right
about Daniel.

36:50.758 --> 36:53.172
He falsified
the cleanup report.

36:55.620 --> 36:56.379
I swear.

36:56.379 --> 36:57.793
I did not know.

36:58.551 --> 36:59.758
I'm so sorry.

37:01.862 --> 37:03.620
I'm really really sorry.

37:03.793 --> 37:05.000
For whatever
that counts for.

37:06.310 --> 37:06.965
Please take it.

37:06.965 --> 37:07.896
It's proof-

37:07.896 --> 37:10.965
that the cleanup
records were falsified.

37:11.655 --> 37:13.206
And proof
of who did it.

37:15.448 --> 37:17.068
Won't this implicate
your husband?

37:17.068 --> 37:20.241
It's everything that you
need for your lawsuit.

37:36.448 --> 37:37.103
Hey.

37:37.103 --> 37:38.586
It's you and
me, right?

37:39.275 --> 37:40.758
Okay, dum dum.

37:41.275 --> 37:42.310
You know what?

37:42.310 --> 37:43.310
They're probably just
going to give you parole-

37:43.310 --> 37:45.137
in exchange for
your testimony.

37:45.137 --> 37:48.172
You just might have to stay
in town a little while though.

37:48.172 --> 37:49.620
Yeah, that's fine.

37:49.620 --> 37:52.172
It's not like I have
anywhere else to be.

37:52.172 --> 37:53.620
Sure, or-

37:53.620 --> 37:54.862
You're not going
to give me advice-

37:54.862 --> 37:56.551
about what to do with
my life again, are you?

37:56.551 --> 37:58.482
No, no just-

37:58.482 --> 37:59.551
I don't know!

37:59.551 --> 38:00.620
When they're done
with you here-

38:00.620 --> 38:02.448
you might want to consider
coming to St. John's!

38:02.448 --> 38:03.275
It's a great town.

38:03.275 --> 38:04.517
There are a lot
of opportunities.

38:05.275 --> 38:06.068
I-

38:07.241 --> 38:09.172
I think you were
right before, Jesse.

38:09.172 --> 38:11.344
I should
probably stay put-

38:11.344 --> 38:13.724
and build
my own life.

38:15.103 --> 38:16.000
Okay.

38:16.413 --> 38:17.206
But you'll visit.

38:17.310 --> 38:18.241
Oh yeah.

38:18.241 --> 38:18.896
Deal.

38:18.896 --> 38:19.965
Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:19.965 --> 38:20.724
Okay.

38:20.724 --> 38:21.724
Bud.

38:21.724 --> 38:22.551
Call me.

38:22.551 --> 38:23.689
Yeah, I know.

38:24.724 --> 38:26.310
And I will.

38:26.310 --> 38:27.103
Okay.

38:27.931 --> 38:28.551
I'll see you.

38:28.551 --> 38:29.448
Bye!

38:29.862 --> 38:30.551
Come on Rex.

38:36.620 --> 38:37.586
Bye!

39:09.275 --> 39:12.689
Is this what
closure feels like?

39:14.103 --> 39:15.103
Sometimes.

39:17.931 --> 39:20.551
But maybe it always feels
like an open wound.

39:21.965 --> 39:23.827
How could I have been married
to him for sixteen years-

39:23.827 --> 39:25.379
and not even know
what he was capable of?

39:26.586 --> 39:27.827
Because you loved him.

39:28.896 --> 39:30.275
And you wanted
to believe.

39:30.482 --> 39:31.448
I don't know.

39:31.448 --> 39:33.275
Without honesty-

39:33.275 --> 39:34.172
without actually seeing him.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.586
I don't know if
that's love at all.

39:43.310 --> 39:44.206
Hey.

39:44.206 --> 39:46.034
Do you know a good
real estate agent?

39:46.034 --> 39:46.965
Uh, yeah.

39:46.965 --> 39:48.827
Yeah, I'll get you
some numbers tomorrow.

39:48.931 --> 39:49.758
Okay.

39:50.241 --> 39:53.448
Um, I actually
don't like salad.

39:55.758 --> 39:56.793
Mmmm!

40:04.896 --> 40:05.896
Mm-hmm!

40:07.517 --> 40:09.103
I'm going to get
groceries tomorrow.

40:09.103 --> 40:09.793
Good.

40:09.896 --> 40:10.551
Mm-hmm.

40:10.551 --> 40:11.413
Mmmm.

40:12.793 --> 40:14.413
I'm going to come back
into work on Monday.

40:14.896 --> 40:16.000
That's great.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.241
Mm-hmm.

40:17.241 --> 40:18.827
And I choose
my own partner.

40:20.482 --> 40:22.517
Uh-

40:22.517 --> 40:23.379
partner?

40:27.896 --> 40:28.862
You know-

40:28.862 --> 40:30.551
second time's a charm
with flying a plane.

40:30.551 --> 40:31.586
Too soon!

40:31.586 --> 40:32.793
Well if the pilot
needs help-

40:32.793 --> 40:34.689
I mean- I feel like my eyes have
really adjusted, you know?

40:34.689 --> 40:37.000
Jesse, I'm going to
drive myself and Rex-

40:37.000 --> 40:38.793
back to St. John's
if you keep it up.

40:38.793 --> 40:40.448
Okay, well-

40:40.448 --> 40:42.310
I hope you have a few
podcasts to listen to.
