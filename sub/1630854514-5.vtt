WEBVTT

00:13.914 --> 00:15.124
- Have a good night.
- You too.

00:21.922 --> 00:24.175
It's amazing. That was so crazy.

00:27.220 --> 00:28.721
- Have a good night.
- You too.

00:37.522 --> 00:39.107
- Have a good night.
- You too.

00:44.236 --> 00:45.822
- We can't.
- I know.

01:00.920 --> 01:02.671
- We can't.
- I know.

01:09.053 --> 01:10.722
- Our clothes stay on.
- Deal.

01:14.434 --> 01:16.185
At least my clothes stayed on?

01:19.272 --> 01:20.482
I need some time to think.

01:23.318 --> 01:24.819
Oh, followers.

01:26.446 --> 01:28.781
It was Shakespeare
who famously declared,

01:29.615 --> 01:32.201
"Politics makes strange bedfellows."

01:33.035 --> 01:36.998
Turns out that in Manhattan,
the same goes for the personal.

01:42.920 --> 01:44.089
Good morning.

01:44.089 --> 01:46.341
I haven't seen you sleep that hard
since the night

01:46.341 --> 01:50.010
after Max's Bar Mitzvah.
You were out late again last night?

01:50.010 --> 01:52.930
My skin is thread count-deprived
from being on the Upper West Side.

01:53.682 --> 01:54.765
Finally!

01:54.765 --> 01:56.685
I started watching Bake Off
while waiting for you to get up

01:56.685 --> 01:58.060
and I already hit the Showstopper.

01:58.060 --> 01:59.646
- I could do breakfast.
- Ordered it.

01:59.646 --> 02:02.064
Hope you're in the mood
for rose croissants from Ladurée.

02:03.066 --> 02:06.069
- Has anyone seen my phone?
- Yeah, I had to put it on Do Not Disturb

02:06.069 --> 02:07.612
because you kept getting
text messages all night

02:07.612 --> 02:09.905
from this person named "G."
It was like--

02:09.905 --> 02:11.783
My grandpa.

02:11.783 --> 02:14.870
He just learned how to text,
and so he keeps sending me emojis.

02:16.872 --> 02:18.665
Looks like breakfast is here!

02:18.665 --> 02:21.834
- Postmates does FaceTime now?
- Who needs Postmates?

02:21.834 --> 02:23.253
Hey babe, we're out front.

02:27.631 --> 02:29.926
Hey. How are you doing?

02:30.593 --> 02:34.346
Well, I'm a little discombobulated
between sleeping here and Shan's

02:34.346 --> 02:37.392
and ignoring all my dad's phone calls,

02:37.392 --> 02:40.019
but I just don't think
I'm ready to talk to him yet.

02:40.019 --> 02:43.023
As someone who could host
a masterclass on dad issues,

02:43.023 --> 02:44.899
whatever you're feeling is valid.

02:44.899 --> 02:48.737
If you're angry, or maybe it's something
you can't even label yet,

02:49.111 --> 02:50.530
it's okay to take some space.

02:51.739 --> 02:55.410
- Yeah. You coming?
- Yes, just give me a second.

03:07.339 --> 03:11.343
So when you find that stress
is stacking up, just remember,

03:11.343 --> 03:14.386
it's important to have someone
that you can talk to.

03:14.720 --> 03:17.264
My favorite year was when
Max ate shit coming off the lift.

03:17.766 --> 03:20.059
He slid ten feet, face down.

03:20.392 --> 03:22.813
- He looked like the IKEA Monkey.
- I am proud to say

03:22.813 --> 03:26.441
that my strengths lie off the slopes.
I bring the favors to the party

03:26.441 --> 03:29.193
enough for us
to après like it's the X Games.

03:29.193 --> 03:30.486
Wait, are you guys going somewhere?

03:30.486 --> 03:31.780
- Boys' trip.
- Boys' trip.

03:31.780 --> 03:34.198
Every spring break,
a group of Constance boys

03:34.198 --> 03:37.034
takes over the Lauder compound
in Aspen for a weekend.

03:37.034 --> 03:39.578
It's as dated
and debaucherous as it sounds.

03:40.414 --> 03:42.916
- Is Obie joining?
- Yes, it took some convincing.

03:42.916 --> 03:45.210
He's still pretty fucked up
about that twin thing.

03:45.210 --> 03:48.922
You know what?
Nothing some fresh powder can't fix.

03:49.880 --> 03:52.716
Honestly, I'm just happy
to get out of that house.

03:53.051 --> 03:55.511
You know, ever since
Dad and Pops reconciled,

03:55.511 --> 03:57.346
I have to announce myself
before entering rooms.

03:57.848 --> 04:00.225
You know, there are some things
one can never unsee.

04:00.225 --> 04:01.642
Okay, Keeks wants to know

04:01.642 --> 04:04.354
if she should do cashmere
or cable knit for her IG debut?

04:04.354 --> 04:07.565
Whatever makes her most comfortable.
"Stop the Story" is all about

04:07.565 --> 04:10.068
dropping the pretense
of artificial online presence.

04:10.068 --> 04:11.403
Okay, so no cashmere.

04:14.113 --> 04:15.948
Americans and their not-milks.

04:16.532 --> 04:18.952
God! You really are one of them.

04:20.620 --> 04:22.163
Oh, don't worry, she's not here.

04:22.163 --> 04:23.706
She doesn't wanna see you either.

04:24.041 --> 04:27.002
She's basing herself out of Southampton.
She just sent me here to grab some files.

04:27.002 --> 04:30.004
Did anybody feel like letting me know
that you guys are in the country?

04:31.089 --> 04:33.841
Since when do you care
about what our family does?

04:33.841 --> 04:36.011
I mean, you certainly
don't care what you do to us.

04:37.471 --> 04:39.305
She knows about this, too.

04:41.641 --> 04:42.684
Everybody does.

04:44.227 --> 04:45.479
No wonder she doesn't wanna call.

04:47.188 --> 04:49.066
And for those that think your problems

04:49.066 --> 04:54.154
can be avoided, be warned.
That which you resist, persists.

04:56.865 --> 04:59.034
- Oh, it's you.
- You buzzed me in, remember?

04:59.034 --> 05:01.285
Right. Sorry. I didn't get much sleep.

05:01.285 --> 05:02.703
Yeah, stress does that.

05:02.703 --> 05:04.456
Like the kind that comes
from knowing your boyfriend

05:04.456 --> 05:06.749
is on a mission to find out
your secret identity!

05:06.749 --> 05:09.836
As long as Mike doesn't know,
I know we have the upper hand.

05:09.836 --> 05:11.003
He has a partner.

05:11.003 --> 05:13.130
For all we know,
they have the upper hand on us.

05:13.130 --> 05:15.717
Burton taught us that if anyone's
pulling the strings around here,

05:15.717 --> 05:18.094
it's the parents, which only makes sense.

05:18.094 --> 05:21.139
Those texts mentioned a wire transfer
from an overseas bank.

05:21.139 --> 05:22.723
Deep pockets and foreign ties?

05:22.723 --> 05:25.560
That's like... 80 percent
of Constance parents,

05:25.560 --> 05:28.395
a hundred percent
of which probably want us dead.

05:28.395 --> 05:30.774
We need to find out
who he's working with fast,

05:30.774 --> 05:33.067
- or we're doomed.
- It's a half-day today, right?

05:33.067 --> 05:34.152
Yeah.

05:36.529 --> 05:37.780
Does all this make the sex better?

05:40.951 --> 05:41.910
Oh, your coffee.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.705
You may remember a photo of me

05:44.705 --> 05:48.375
in this gorgeous dress
that went viral last December...

05:48.375 --> 05:50.668
for all the wrong reasons.
I figured it was time

05:50.668 --> 05:54.255
to "Stop the Story" and reveal
how it really felt to be inside it.

05:54.255 --> 05:57.508
I'm joined with that dress's designer,
Katherine Hope,

05:57.508 --> 05:59.802
because I made her a part of my story

05:59.802 --> 06:02.680
- without her permission.
- Thank you.

06:02.680 --> 06:06.143
I was really hurt.
This was not a finished product.

06:06.601 --> 06:09.229
And I augmented it
without even telling you.

06:09.229 --> 06:11.940
Well, a lot of clients do that.
It was more that it was a first draft.

06:11.940 --> 06:15.277
I didn't get to fit it on you.
But I forgive you,

06:15.277 --> 06:17.112
because I understood
where you were coming from.

06:17.112 --> 06:21.949
I made some really bad decisions
in my life based on fear

06:21.949 --> 06:24.536
and I'm not even talking
about my mental health issues.

06:24.536 --> 06:26.413
I just have been selfish

06:26.413 --> 06:29.416
in trying to avoid
some pretty hard truths about my life.

06:29.416 --> 06:33.253
Would you mind stopping your story
to discuss some of those?

06:37.758 --> 06:40.593
Sure. I'm talking about the time...

06:42.179 --> 06:44.473
when I realized that there were
three people in my marriage.

06:45.140 --> 06:47.975
Me, and my husband, and my assistant.

06:48.601 --> 06:50.729
And that can work really well

06:50.729 --> 06:53.732
for some people,
but it just wasn't our agreement.

06:54.231 --> 06:56.735
And I worked really hard
to turn a blind eye

06:56.735 --> 06:59.071
because I didn't wanna lose
either one of them.

06:59.071 --> 07:01.447
And then I ended up losing them both.

07:02.615 --> 07:04.743
Losing everything, or almost everything.

07:07.537 --> 07:08.829
Why don't we pause here?

07:09.205 --> 07:12.792
- I'm sorry. Did I mess it up?
- No. No, no, no, you were perfect.

07:12.792 --> 07:14.543
- We just have to go to school.
- Okay.

07:22.760 --> 07:26.722
What kind of snacks you want
for the train? Chex Mix? Pocky?

07:26.722 --> 07:29.809
- Keto meat sticks?
- I don't eat on the subway.

07:29.809 --> 07:31.769
Subway? Bish, we going to Philly!

07:31.769 --> 07:34.563
- And why are we going to Philly?
- Because there's a dirty,

07:34.563 --> 07:37.566
filthy rave in a warehouse
in North Philly.

07:38.067 --> 07:41.697
- And guess who's gonna be attending?
- The '90s, when raves were a thing.

07:41.697 --> 07:44.574
- Terrell.
- Wait, are you two--

07:44.574 --> 07:46.283
No! He's gonna be there for you.

07:46.283 --> 07:48.119
What happened with me was a mistake.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.329
He didn't even know
you were his real admirer.

07:50.329 --> 07:53.959
And what better place to tell him
than a dark, sweaty warehouse?

07:53.959 --> 07:55.334
Okay. I--

07:55.334 --> 07:58.380
Maybe we just take
my first unsupervised weekend

07:58.380 --> 07:59.922
a little quieter?

07:59.922 --> 08:01.924
There's a night exhibit at the Whitney
that we can go see.

08:01.924 --> 08:04.845
- I don't have a curfew.
- Are you 72? What are you talking about?

08:04.845 --> 08:06.429
- You're gonna love it.
- The Whitney? Girl!

08:09.807 --> 08:11.935
You're not still talking
to that married guy, are you?

08:11.935 --> 08:13.353
No. Course not.

08:13.853 --> 08:16.314
- Z! Shopping after half-day?
- Yeah, I'm free.

08:18.023 --> 08:20.193
Shan, I'm sorry--
I'm not gonna go to Philly with you!

08:20.193 --> 08:23.237
The cars will be here after school.
Meet up at the tables?

08:23.739 --> 08:25.282
Look, don't worry, Obie. Okay?

08:25.282 --> 08:29.744
Look, Aspen's altitude will make
all Grace-related problems miniscule.

08:29.744 --> 08:31.872
Look, I'm not-- I'm fine.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.419
Hey, Jules. Jules!

08:38.669 --> 08:41.339
If you want me to feel bad
about Valentine's, I do.

08:41.339 --> 08:43.133
I don't. I just wanna say thank you.

08:43.133 --> 08:44.675
For blowing up your relationship?

08:44.675 --> 08:48.805
No. For showing me what was wrong
with it. Very wrong with it.

08:48.805 --> 08:51.683
But I did find a new painful distraction.

08:51.683 --> 08:53.977
Apparently,
my family's New Year's resolution

08:53.977 --> 08:55.896
is to pretend that I no longer exist.

08:55.896 --> 08:58.814
- I'm sure that's not true.
- Julien, my mother has been

08:58.814 --> 09:00.649
in Southampton for weeks
and I just found out.

09:01.485 --> 09:02.444
She's avoiding me.

09:02.860 --> 09:05.071
Remember when we tried to sneak
some of her brandy

09:05.071 --> 09:07.866
and you accidentally broke her
Lalique decanter

09:07.866 --> 09:09.366
that Steve Wynn gave her?

09:09.366 --> 09:10.701
Yeah, and she pretended
not to notice

09:10.701 --> 09:13.497
and then iced me out for a week
until I admitted to it.

09:13.497 --> 09:16.083
- Hmm. Maybe admit what you did?
- Yeah.

09:16.083 --> 09:17.167
What did I do?

09:17.875 --> 09:20.379
You rebelled. They distanced themselves

09:20.379 --> 09:22.756
and instead of just having
a hard conversation,

09:22.756 --> 09:25.759
you tried to smooth things over
by dating someone

09:25.759 --> 09:28.177
- they'd approve of.
- Wow. You're good at this.

09:28.177 --> 09:31.931
I've been examining myself.
A byproduct being that I can see

09:31.931 --> 09:34.183
into other people, too, apparently.

09:35.059 --> 09:36.143
Just talk to her.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.105
Say you're sorry for this year's decanter,

09:38.105 --> 09:40.689
and she'll let it go. She always does.

09:42.900 --> 09:44.528
Now, to take my own advice.

09:45.404 --> 09:46.863
- Good luck.
- You too.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.950
- I'm still mad.
- You have every right to be.

09:50.950 --> 09:53.869
But it's been a few days,
and Zoya's not picking up my calls.

09:53.869 --> 09:56.831
- I'm taking care of her.
- I appreciate that, but she's 15.

09:56.831 --> 09:58.458
And I need to know that she's okay.

09:58.458 --> 10:01.753
She's fine. You just lost her trust.
Both of ours.

10:02.087 --> 10:05.172
I know. I hate what I did.
And I've regretted it ever since.

10:05.757 --> 10:07.718
I just wish I had the opportunity
to tell her that.

10:08.050 --> 10:10.678
Maybe you can.
This might be a bad idea, but...

10:16.016 --> 10:18.520
T-minus four and a half hours
till the hot tub.

10:18.520 --> 10:21.063
Well, I just agreed
to a night ski when we get in.

10:21.523 --> 10:24.025
- Save me a jet?
- Well, there's always my lap.

10:24.025 --> 10:26.903
Oh, Audrey--
Yeah, we never discussed this.

10:26.903 --> 10:28.362
Aki and I, can we...

10:28.362 --> 10:31.158
- Of course. You don't have to ask me.
- Thanks, babe.

10:32.158 --> 10:33.617
We'll send pics if it happens.

10:33.617 --> 10:37.039
The Aspen annual is hardly
a hotbed of sexual activity.

10:37.039 --> 10:39.457
Thirty straight guys in one chalet,

10:39.457 --> 10:42.753
- most of which snore or smell.
- And all of which aren't you.

10:42.753 --> 10:45.296
Thanks, babes. I trust you both. Bye.

10:48.424 --> 10:49.426
Where's Obie?

10:59.018 --> 11:00.728
- Because he's in there.
- Okay.

11:20.582 --> 11:21.665
Go! Go! Go!

11:25.295 --> 11:27.963
- Are you sure you can do this?
- I'm the computer science teacher!

11:30.007 --> 11:32.052
See? He uses the password
admin gave him.

11:32.803 --> 11:35.931
Now, let's see if he linked
his messaging app.

11:50.611 --> 11:51.695
What are you doing?

11:52.489 --> 11:54.491
- I just wanted to--
- Break into my computer?

12:02.582 --> 12:05.084
- So now you're ambushing me?
- This isn't an ambush.

12:05.084 --> 12:06.211
He just wants to talk.

12:06.211 --> 12:08.754
Stop your own story, Julien.
Let me live mine.

12:08.754 --> 12:11.299
Don't blame her.
She hasn't forgiven me yet, either.

12:11.299 --> 12:13.760
I don't care.
I guess I can't trust either of you.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.429
- Please, just come home?
- It's not home. Not anymore.

12:16.429 --> 12:18.139
- Don't be like that, Z.
- You know what's funny?

12:18.139 --> 12:19.266
Your dad has always been bad,

12:19.266 --> 12:22.059
but mine only started lying
in proximity to yours.

12:22.519 --> 12:24.270
I guess being deceitful
runs in the family.

12:24.270 --> 12:25.355
Jesus, Z!

12:25.731 --> 12:28.149
I'm done talking.
To both of you. Let's go.

12:28.149 --> 12:30.026
I'm in. What time is that train again?

12:31.361 --> 12:33.904
She didn't mean it.
You're not your father.

12:33.904 --> 12:35.032
You're not a liar.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.667
Okay, fine. You caught me.

12:46.084 --> 12:49.713
I was digging because...
because I think you might be Gossip Girl.

12:49.713 --> 12:51.255
Why would you think that?

12:51.255 --> 12:53.884
When we first met,
you were looking into the headmistress.

12:53.884 --> 12:55.761
You're always talking
about "outing corruption."

12:55.761 --> 12:58.597
- It sounds an awful lot like--
- I am not Gossip Girl!

12:58.597 --> 12:59.765
Prove it.

12:59.765 --> 13:01.265
- You prove it.
- Prove what?

13:01.265 --> 13:06.021
That you're not her. Show me your
phone. Open your Instagram. Come on.

13:06.021 --> 13:08.607
- You open yours!
- I asked you first.

13:12.694 --> 13:14.112
Dude, the cars are leaving.

13:14.613 --> 13:15.988
Guys, I'm not coming.

13:16.781 --> 13:19.201
Look, you cannot let
a little bit of twincest

13:19.201 --> 13:20.326
- derail your life.
- Okay.

13:20.326 --> 13:23.205
Please never say that again.
All right? It's my mom.

13:23.537 --> 13:25.664
Look, I've been
putting this shit off for a long time

13:25.664 --> 13:27.918
and I need to prioritize it.
Go, you're gonna miss your flight.

13:27.918 --> 13:31.796
No, because it's not gonna be a guys' trip
if the three of us aren't together.

13:31.796 --> 13:34.381
And you shouldn't have
to face Helena alone.

13:34.716 --> 13:37.177
You know what?
Who gives a fuck about the snow

13:37.177 --> 13:39.345
when we have your mom's spa?

13:39.345 --> 13:41.640
Is there room for two more
in that chopper?

13:43.558 --> 13:45.644
All right, all right, all right. Let's go.

13:50.773 --> 13:54.068
- Hi, Harris. Can I help you?
- Just here to offer my applause

13:54.068 --> 13:55.903
for letting your boyfriends
go away together.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.947
I'm sure hastening the inevitable is hard,

13:57.947 --> 14:00.324
- but so smart.
- Hastening what now?

14:00.324 --> 14:03.870
Them leaving you by the side of the road
like every throuple ever has done?

14:03.870 --> 14:05.371
One always drops eventually.

14:05.371 --> 14:08.374
And since everyone knows
there's no such thing as bisexuality,

14:08.709 --> 14:10.293
the one dropping single here is you.

14:10.293 --> 14:13.754
Don't you think that's a wildly
politically incorrect way of thinking?

14:13.754 --> 14:17.383
Girl, no. Bisexuality just got
a good publicist during the pandemi.

14:17.383 --> 14:19.343
Who do you think came up
with "bisexual lighting"?

14:19.885 --> 14:24.725
Aki's one great dick away from dedicated.
Mark my words, you'll be solo by Sunday.

14:31.815 --> 14:33.941
Fine. I'll show you mine
if you show me yours

14:33.941 --> 14:36.444
- at the same time.
- Okay. Deal. On three.

14:38.572 --> 14:42.325
Spotted. Kids leaving schools
all over the city.

14:42.325 --> 14:45.746
Wonder what they...
they'll get up to, I wonder?

14:45.746 --> 14:48.623
How could I be Gossip Girl
and post without touching my phone?

14:48.623 --> 14:52.002
Yeah. That shows you I'm not her, either.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.676
Now that means I can finally
tell you my secret.

15:02.511 --> 15:05.140
- I'm looking for her.
- You are? Why?

15:05.598 --> 15:06.975
I'm being blackmailed.

15:09.561 --> 15:11.396
Wanna tell me about it over lunch?

15:28.205 --> 15:30.165
A moment. Otto?

15:31.540 --> 15:33.960
- Otto, is that you?
- Hello, Mama.

15:35.586 --> 15:37.589
Hello. What are you doing here?

15:38.339 --> 15:41.050
You know, Heidi said
that you guys were in town, and I just...

15:41.717 --> 15:43.010
missed you a little bit.

15:44.638 --> 15:46.806
So I hope it's okay that we came up.

15:46.806 --> 15:49.016
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. More than okay.

15:50.059 --> 15:52.312
Why don't you take
your usual room upstairs, Akeno?

15:52.312 --> 15:53.854
- Thanks.
- And you take Heidi's room

15:53.854 --> 15:55.065
down here for nostalgia, Max?

15:56.900 --> 15:57.900
Tea?

15:58.526 --> 15:59.736
Yeah.

15:59.736 --> 16:01.321
Meet up in your room in ten minutes.

16:01.321 --> 16:02.531
Alles gut?

16:02.531 --> 16:03.573
I'll be waiting.

16:05.449 --> 16:09.037
- So, wanna tell me about this person?
- Who I can't name.

16:09.663 --> 16:10.788
And why is that?

16:12.249 --> 16:15.168
During my sabbatical,
I asked to borrow money from someone

16:15.168 --> 16:17.711
who I thought was a friend
for a project I wanted to do.

16:18.380 --> 16:20.297
Gave them my bank info to wire me.

16:21.340 --> 16:23.676
The next thing I know,
they took control of my account,

16:23.676 --> 16:25.804
locked me out,
and threatened to do worse

16:25.804 --> 16:28.347
unless I gave them
the identity of Gossip Girl.

16:29.140 --> 16:30.642
And apparently, I'm taking too long.

16:32.853 --> 16:34.895
This is my mess.
I shouldn't have involved you.

16:34.895 --> 16:36.148
No, it's okay,

16:36.148 --> 16:37.773
- we'll figure this out.
- No.

16:37.773 --> 16:39.651
How close have you gotten?

16:39.651 --> 16:42.737
Well, I told my blackmailer
that I'd narrowed it down

16:42.737 --> 16:45.948
to a couple students,
but honestly, I was vamping.

16:46.741 --> 16:49.453
I mean, a kid couldn't have
all this access and free time.

16:49.453 --> 16:51.663
So, I started to think it was a teacher.

16:52.496 --> 16:54.331
- A teacher, really?
- Yeah.

16:55.042 --> 16:56.585
- No, that's...
- Well...

16:57.252 --> 17:00.171
I've-- To stoop so low to do that to kids?

17:00.171 --> 17:01.840
Yeah, well,
you know how little we get paid.

17:02.466 --> 17:04.091
- How little we're noticed...
- Yeah.

17:04.091 --> 17:05.760
- ...thought of, listened to?
- Right.

17:06.552 --> 17:09.722
Hell, if it didn't exist already,
I could have started it myself.

17:10.473 --> 17:11.850
Once I realized that,
it became much easier

17:11.850 --> 17:13.058
to put some pieces together.

17:13.726 --> 17:15.936
Do you know a Sharon Kleinberg
from Dalton?

17:15.936 --> 17:17.564
A Tati Gardinier from Spence?

17:18.774 --> 17:21.525
You okay? I'm gonna speak
with them tomorrow.

17:22.944 --> 17:26.198
Sharon? I've never heard of them.

17:27.281 --> 17:28.866
- Will you excuse me a moment?
- Yeah.

17:33.954 --> 17:37.417
Hi. Mike thinks GG is a teacher.
We have to move quickly.

17:37.417 --> 17:38.794
Did that number amount to anything?

17:38.794 --> 17:41.337
- It's registered to Munich.
- Obie's parents.

17:41.337 --> 17:43.882
It would make sense.
He sent us those tax returns

17:43.882 --> 17:46.175
that I deleted, remember?
Maybe they found out?

17:46.592 --> 17:47.969
Get Wendy to call Sharon and Tati.

17:47.969 --> 17:51.056
Tell them whatever they do,
stay away from anyone named Shubin.

18:00.440 --> 18:01.649
This is a boarding call for...

18:01.649 --> 18:03.610
Maybe I should just tell my dad
where we're going.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.696
You're off the teat for tonight, 'kay?

18:05.696 --> 18:07.613
It's just, my dad and I
have always been a unit.

18:07.613 --> 18:09.533
And when we came here, he was
so worried that I was gonna change

18:09.533 --> 18:11.033
into something else, but...

18:11.033 --> 18:13.954
Actually, he's the one that did.
Not me. And he's always raised me

18:13.954 --> 18:17.289
to conduct myself in this...
this certain manner, but he's not.

18:17.289 --> 18:20.167
- So why should I? You know what I mean?
- Tell me, baby, tell me.

18:20.167 --> 18:23.003
And I've never just let go
and done something fun and reckless.

18:23.003 --> 18:24.588
Then tonight is the night.

18:25.047 --> 18:26.258
Attention, please.

18:26.258 --> 18:27.466
- Come on.
- This is the boarding call

18:27.466 --> 18:29.552
for Amtrak Acela Express train...

18:29.552 --> 18:32.556
- Wait, that's just orange juice.
- Duh. Chaser first. C'mon.

18:33.557 --> 18:36.016
Shanbucha. My personal recipe.

18:36.351 --> 18:40.146
One inch from every bottle
in the house plus some Sprite for taste.

18:41.606 --> 18:44.150
...and terminating in Washington, DC.

18:44.150 --> 18:46.111
- It's good shit.
- Yeah, that's good shit.

18:49.363 --> 18:53.285
Schwarztee, from home. Dein favorit.

18:55.327 --> 18:57.205
I wish you'd told me you were coming.

18:58.790 --> 19:02.543
I know. I know, and I'm--

19:03.253 --> 19:05.547
I'm sorry, I just--
I was worried that if you heard

19:05.547 --> 19:08.258
I was on my way, you might leave.
You know, I--

19:10.010 --> 19:11.260
I know you're upset with me.

19:12.596 --> 19:14.222
Disappointed, yeah.

19:16.390 --> 19:18.476
And perhaps I have not handled
that the way I should.

19:21.395 --> 19:23.439
I did not think
that not having you with us

19:23.439 --> 19:25.734
over Weihnachten would be so difficult.

19:27.277 --> 19:28.652
I know I am part to blame.

19:29.905 --> 19:32.908
I've been here for weeks,
but I was going to come see you.

19:32.908 --> 19:35.201
But you seemed so happy
with that young woman, so...

19:36.036 --> 19:37.828
seeing you happy,
I didn't want to interrupt that.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.872
Yeah, well that didn't turn out
well, did it?

19:40.414 --> 19:42.334
Americans love to break boundaries.

19:42.334 --> 19:43.877
They're so bored all the time.

19:44.835 --> 19:45.796
Not us, though.

19:46.629 --> 19:50.091
We're never boring. Just selfish, perhaps.

19:51.092 --> 19:53.011
Self-centered,
is that what they call it here?

19:53.385 --> 19:54.346
Yeah.

19:55.554 --> 19:57.265
I'm not the monster you think I am.

19:59.059 --> 20:01.937
Well, I'm sorry that I make you think
that I think that...

20:02.520 --> 20:03.480
sometimes.

20:04.314 --> 20:05.439
Go freshen up.

20:06.190 --> 20:08.985
Let's have a nice evening.
I'll make you Käsespätzle.

20:10.069 --> 20:13.615
Also, would you mind
letting Akeno know I'd like a word?

20:13.615 --> 20:15.616
I haven't seen him
since the December dinner.

20:16.075 --> 20:19.413
I'd like to thank him for the list of
the dokumentarfilms he recommended.

20:19.745 --> 20:20.706
I'll tell him.

20:27.378 --> 20:29.798
You've reached Aki.
You know what to do.

20:29.798 --> 20:32.134
Still no answer.
Do you think it was right for me

20:32.134 --> 20:34.469
to let Aki and Max have sex without me?

20:34.803 --> 20:37.513
Why wouldn't it be? Haven't you ever,
just like, sat one out before?

20:37.513 --> 20:38.890
Yeah, but that was
before Valentine's Day,

20:38.890 --> 20:41.226
when Max and Aki ventured
into new territory.

20:41.226 --> 20:44.646
Since then, they haven't been able
to keep their hands off of each other.

20:44.646 --> 20:47.524
I've never felt like
Cuck-Mille de Haan until now.

20:47.524 --> 20:49.067
So that's what this is about?

20:49.067 --> 20:51.445
What if them hooking up alone
without me makes them realize

20:51.445 --> 20:53.321
they didn't need me in the first place?

20:53.863 --> 20:55.531
If I'm acting crazy, just say it.

20:55.531 --> 20:59.410
Not crazy. Just... overthinking.

21:01.079 --> 21:03.123
I need to make a call.
I'll see you up there.

21:03.873 --> 21:05.000
Good afternoon.

21:16.385 --> 21:17.428
Hey.

21:17.428 --> 21:20.432
I wanted to meet to tell you
in person that we can't do this.

21:20.973 --> 21:22.099
Spend time together?

21:22.808 --> 21:25.353
- Have an affair.
- Are we having an affair?

21:25.353 --> 21:28.272
Aren't we? I mean, weren't we?

21:28.606 --> 21:32.110
I need to do better. Be better.
If not for me, for Z.

21:34.028 --> 21:36.864
So... I guess this is goodbye?

21:42.453 --> 21:45.332
You've reached Aki.
You know what to do.

21:47.041 --> 21:49.878
Aki, you know we have rules
about Do Not Disturb.

21:49.878 --> 21:51.338
You know,
sometimes I jump to conclusions,

21:51.338 --> 21:53.215
but this type of thing makes me wonder--

21:53.215 --> 21:54.381
Never mind.

21:54.381 --> 21:58.052
Love you, gotta go.
Gideon, what a nice surprise.

21:58.052 --> 22:00.806
- You should've been here this morning.
- What did I miss?

22:00.806 --> 22:02.557
She talked about the divorce. In public.

22:02.557 --> 22:05.810
Keeks! It usually takes me
dinner and a show to get you there.

22:05.810 --> 22:08.938
- I just hope I wasn't too much.
- No, it's just a lot I didn't know.

22:08.938 --> 22:10.523
- Really? Like what?
- Like,

22:10.523 --> 22:12.942
how did you know
things were going south?

22:12.942 --> 22:15.736
I mean, your father basically
stopped communicating with me.

22:15.736 --> 22:18.364
He would send my calls
straight to voicemail,

22:18.364 --> 22:20.367
took hours to return my texts.

22:20.367 --> 22:21.742
Yeah, we've all been there, darling.

22:21.742 --> 22:24.620
There must have been something
more than that, right?

22:24.620 --> 22:27.206
Like constant fights?
Long nights at the office?

22:27.833 --> 22:31.044
No. I genuinely thought we were happy.

22:31.044 --> 22:33.170
- I was pretty blindsided.
- Blindsided.

22:33.170 --> 22:37.383
That is exactly the term I would use
to describe Roy's confession. Just...

22:38.175 --> 22:40.345
- totally blindsided.
- Not "completely" completely, right?

22:40.345 --> 22:42.096
I mean, you must have
sensed something was off?

22:42.096 --> 22:45.142
Honestly? No. I mean--
But then, well, here we are,

22:45.142 --> 22:47.185
and I'm getting fitted
for our vow renewal,

22:47.185 --> 22:48.894
so I think it all worked out just fine.

22:50.396 --> 22:52.858
Well, speaking as someone
it did not work out for,

22:52.858 --> 22:56.570
there was one time
my spidey-senses went up.

22:56.570 --> 22:59.406
- It was when your father and...
- Jessica.

22:59.740 --> 23:01.866
...went to Milan on a work trip, and I...

23:02.325 --> 23:04.243
I knew what was happening.
And I should've stopped it.

23:04.243 --> 23:06.997
No. Nonsense. In a relationship,

23:06.997 --> 23:09.291
you either assume the best
of your partner

23:09.291 --> 23:13.169
or you give into this fear,
which will destroy you.

23:13.169 --> 23:14.546
So what kind of person

23:14.546 --> 23:15.963
- would you wanna be, honestly?
- Yeah.

23:20.510 --> 23:21.469
Took you look enough.

23:22.679 --> 23:25.306
- Sorry, I thought you were Aki.
- Yeah, clearly.

23:26.266 --> 23:28.310
Dude, I think your mom
just asked me something

23:28.310 --> 23:29.728
- she shouldn't have.
- What?

23:29.728 --> 23:31.645
If I knew why you were really here.

23:31.645 --> 23:34.273
Why I'm really here? Oh, Jesus.

23:34.273 --> 23:35.901
All right.
She really doesn't trust me at all.

23:35.901 --> 23:38.236
Well, I think you are the one
who shouldn't trust her.

24:02.426 --> 24:03.385
Danke.

24:18.735 --> 24:19.695
Was I right?

24:20.195 --> 24:21.530
Yeah. She hasn't changed at all.

24:26.201 --> 24:28.702
- I think we're alone.
- Yeah. About that.

24:35.459 --> 24:37.170
She isn't comfortable with this, is she?

24:37.170 --> 24:38.255
Yeah, I think not.

24:38.838 --> 24:41.757
And we should be good boyfriends, right?

24:42.092 --> 24:43.050
The best.

24:46.012 --> 24:46.971
Okay.

25:01.318 --> 25:02.696
Audrey? What--

25:02.696 --> 25:07.701
No Aki or Max. No Aki or Max.
No Aki or Max. No Aki or Max.

25:07.701 --> 25:09.494
So I called Phil, and guess what?

25:09.494 --> 25:13.415
Aki, Max, and Obie are in the Hamptons.
They're fucking each other, Julien.

25:13.415 --> 25:16.709
- Obie, Aki, and Max?
- No, Aki and Max.

25:16.709 --> 25:18.336
I thought you said they could.

25:18.336 --> 25:19.880
Now they're gonna realize
they can do it without me.

25:19.880 --> 25:23.550
- They can.
- Hi. Who are you? Is this your car?

25:23.550 --> 25:26.511
Can you drive me to the Hamptons?
I can pay you for gas.

25:26.511 --> 25:29.138
You can't just crash their weekend, Audge.

25:29.138 --> 25:33.685
I'm not going to. I'm gonna surprise them,
so we can spend this weekend together.

25:33.685 --> 25:35.020
Are you the married guy?

25:35.771 --> 25:36.813
I'm Graham.

25:37.355 --> 25:39.232
- You getting in?
- Where have you been hiding

25:39.232 --> 25:41.777
this kind soul, Julien? Thank you.

25:42.152 --> 25:45.280
- You do not have to take her there.
- Nothing else to do.

25:45.280 --> 25:49.533
And besides, it means I get to spend
at least two more hours with you

25:49.533 --> 25:51.368
before never seeing you ever again.

25:52.537 --> 25:54.455
More like three, it's Friday afternoon.

25:54.455 --> 25:57.000
Hey, can I get the aux?
I'll play my own music. Thanks.

26:41.377 --> 26:42.337
Yeah.

26:56.809 --> 26:58.937
Danke. Danke. Okay.

27:03.150 --> 27:04.192
Okay.

27:18.456 --> 27:22.585
Hi. So sorry. So sorry. Okay.
There is no way we're gonna get inside.

27:23.211 --> 27:25.713
Don't sweat it, babygirl.
When have I not had a hookup?

27:26.048 --> 27:30.426
My girl Cory's uncle is a promoter.
We met at Stagedoor last summer.

27:30.426 --> 27:31.969
- Sabrina!
- Cory!

27:31.969 --> 27:34.096
Sabrina! Come hither!

27:34.096 --> 27:37.309
- My darling.
- Love.

27:37.309 --> 27:39.310
I can't believe you came
all the way from Bristol for this!

27:39.310 --> 27:41.395
Oh, Luv! I wouldn't miss it for the world.

27:41.395 --> 27:43.106
This is my brother, Drew.

27:43.106 --> 27:45.483
Ignore him. He's just pissed
he has to stay with me

27:45.483 --> 27:46.859
since our dad's outta town.
Who's your friend?

27:47.277 --> 27:49.780
Oh, this is my mate. Monet.

27:50.655 --> 27:54.451
She's aces. Truly. Reckless and fun...

27:54.451 --> 27:55.619
Okay.

27:57.579 --> 27:59.371
Yeah, I'm Monet de Haan.

27:59.830 --> 28:02.208
Nice to meet you, girl.
Okay, they're with me.

28:02.208 --> 28:04.085
They should be good. Let's go.

28:04.085 --> 28:06.087
Yeah. Thank you, darling.

28:10.591 --> 28:12.676
You sure you guys don't want
to be alone in here?

28:12.676 --> 28:14.054
- No, we're good.
- I'm fine.

28:14.762 --> 28:15.805
Okay.

28:27.359 --> 28:29.360
- You know what's highly underrated?
- What?

28:29.360 --> 28:31.780
- Modesty. You want some towels?
- Hell, yeah.

28:31.780 --> 28:32.905
Beautiful, me too.

28:36.659 --> 28:38.160
You know what?
I'm gonna get out of here.

28:38.160 --> 28:40.037
- I gotta make a call real quick.
- You can't leave.

28:40.037 --> 28:41.539
We're not even at optimal temp yet.

28:41.539 --> 28:43.707
You know, we don't really get to,
you know, hang out,

28:43.707 --> 28:46.252
just us three, you know. Three Kings.

28:46.670 --> 28:49.756
The Three Musketeers.
Three Caballeros.

28:49.756 --> 28:52.175
Okay, enough with the movie titles,
all right?

28:52.175 --> 28:55.220
I'm gonna step out of here
and I'll see you guys later...

28:56.763 --> 28:58.056
for more awkwardness.

29:03.519 --> 29:04.896
This is bad.

29:04.896 --> 29:08.775
Yeah. Well, it is 195 degrees,
and in a couple of minutes,

29:08.775 --> 29:10.776
we won't be able to think
about anything, right?

29:11.527 --> 29:14.947
Well, we're both naked and sweating
and I can only think about one thing.

29:15.990 --> 29:19.745
Well, we made a deal for Audrey.
Remember?

29:19.745 --> 29:20.953
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:25.040 --> 29:27.668
- I did remember my travel pharmacy.
- Oh, that's great.

29:27.668 --> 29:32.257
How about we both take an Ativan
to really dial down the libido?

29:32.591 --> 29:34.926
- It could work.
- Absolutely.

29:36.428 --> 29:40.014
And so I guess that pretty much sums up
how I proposed to Ashley.

29:40.014 --> 29:41.391
What a love story!

29:41.391 --> 29:43.350
Thank you, Audrey, for that deep dive

29:43.350 --> 29:46.687
into Graham's fairytale marriage.
Thank God we're here.

29:46.687 --> 29:50.065
What can I say? I'm a romantic. Hey,
can you park here and cut the lights?

29:50.065 --> 29:52.234
I don't want Aki and Max
to see me, thanks.

29:55.947 --> 29:58.783
Audrey, do you really think
this is the best way

29:58.783 --> 30:01.745
- to build trust with Max and Aki?
- You wanna talk about trust?

30:01.745 --> 30:03.288
Coming from the girl
who's having an affair

30:03.288 --> 30:06.040
- and lying to me about it?
- I'm not having an affair.

30:06.040 --> 30:07.751
So, you have not slept with him?

30:07.751 --> 30:09.919
I was breaking up with him
when you found us.

30:09.919 --> 30:13.131
I know you're upset with me,
but I'm just trying to be a good person

30:13.131 --> 30:16.051
- and a good friend to you.
- Be one by keeping a lookout.

30:23.015 --> 30:25.143
That number that Mike's
been texting is a burner.

30:25.143 --> 30:27.436
So, dead end there. I'm starting to think

30:27.436 --> 30:30.272
he's playing Kate
and this is all a wild gans chase.

30:30.272 --> 30:31.607
That's German for "goose."

30:31.607 --> 30:33.985
- I got that.
- Also, why aren't you here?

30:33.985 --> 30:35.821
I told you, I'm very busy.

30:35.821 --> 30:37.739
All right.
This is the address you gave me.

30:37.739 --> 30:41.784
- Are you sure this is right?
- According to the faculty records.

30:41.784 --> 30:45.247
I knew that sob story
about frozen accounts was bullshit.

30:45.247 --> 30:47.874
He's loaded. I can't wait to tell Kate.

30:47.874 --> 30:50.419
That Mike is handsome and rich?

30:50.419 --> 30:52.211
She'll be devastated.

30:54.089 --> 30:55.132
Can I help you?

30:55.132 --> 30:59.886
Yes, we-- I'm a friend of Mike's.
Do you know him?

30:59.886 --> 31:05.724
My name's Adam. He asked me to come by
and pick up some papers that need grading.

31:05.724 --> 31:09.020
I'm his mother, Barb.
It's lovely to meet a friend of Mikey's!

31:09.020 --> 31:10.980
Come in,
we'll get you whatever you need.

31:27.456 --> 31:29.749
How are we ever gonna find Terrell here?

31:29.749 --> 31:33.795
- Keep calm and carry on, luv.
- Okay, are you gonna do that all night?

31:33.795 --> 31:37.424
We were taught at Stagedoor
to never break character.

31:38.841 --> 31:41.927
- Think of me as Jeremy Strong.
- Luv, hey!

31:41.927 --> 31:45.556
- Okay, compliments of Uncle Reed.
- Oh, she's not much of a drinker.

31:45.556 --> 31:47.683
Are you kidding? Monet loves a cocktail.

31:47.683 --> 31:49.018
M'kay. 'Kay.

31:53.023 --> 31:54.316
Never break character, right?

31:55.942 --> 31:58.820
- Well, let's party. Okay!
- Let's go. Let's go.

32:11.750 --> 32:14.628
- I missed this place.
- It's beautiful.

32:15.544 --> 32:18.422
And freezing.
Should we get back in the car?

32:20.634 --> 32:22.301
We both know where that will lead.

32:24.970 --> 32:26.932
You could have just texted me today.

32:27.432 --> 32:30.184
- We didn't have to meet.
- I wanted to see you.

32:30.726 --> 32:31.812
To break my heart?

32:32.728 --> 32:34.689
No. Because I couldn't.

32:35.856 --> 32:37.150
But after Audrey

32:37.609 --> 32:40.237
dragged out all those stories
about you and Ashley...

32:40.237 --> 32:41.988
She's not very subtle, is she?

32:42.488 --> 32:43.447
No.

32:44.824 --> 32:45.992
But she is right.

32:47.118 --> 32:50.788
No matter what there is between us,
I can't mess with your marriage.

32:51.164 --> 32:54.501
I've lived through that.
My mom left when I was a baby,

32:54.501 --> 32:58.087
and that has had a ripple effect
on my whole life.

32:58.087 --> 33:00.423
Not that she's responsible
for what my dad did,

33:00.423 --> 33:03.427
but maybe in his pain,

33:03.427 --> 33:05.971
he let the darker side
of himself take over. I don't know.

33:06.763 --> 33:09.557
- I try not to make excuses for him.
- You two don't speak?

33:11.142 --> 33:12.602
Why would I ever talk to him?

33:17.816 --> 33:18.775
What?

33:19.483 --> 33:20.484
You're just...

33:21.485 --> 33:22.528
not what I expected.

33:24.155 --> 33:26.532
Look, there's something
I should probably tell you--

33:26.532 --> 33:29.034
Hold that thought. I'll be right back.

33:54.227 --> 33:57.980
- What are you doing? You need to get--
- Go! Seriously?

34:13.830 --> 34:14.831
Care to explain?

34:24.131 --> 34:25.132
Hey. Hey, hey, hey.

34:25.674 --> 34:27.426
Have you seen Shan-- I mean Sabrina?

34:28.095 --> 34:29.804
She and Cory took off to the other party.

34:29.804 --> 34:31.556
- They didn't tell you?
- Wait, she left?

34:31.556 --> 34:33.850
It's just a couple blocks away.
I can take you if you want?

34:34.893 --> 34:37.895
Or you can stay here.
I'm sure they'll come back eventually.

34:39.022 --> 34:41.273
No, no, no. I don't feel so good.

34:41.607 --> 34:42.650
I can help with that.

34:44.319 --> 34:45.528
You want to get some fresh air?

34:51.450 --> 34:52.619
George will be right up.

34:53.995 --> 34:56.414
So, Mike lives with you?

34:56.997 --> 35:00.793
He moved into the basement apartment
when he got back from Minsk.

35:00.793 --> 35:02.045
He was in Belarus?

35:02.045 --> 35:04.673
For six months,
working on his documentary.

35:05.047 --> 35:07.091
You said you were friends,
I thought you would know.

35:07.091 --> 35:09.510
I do. I just thought he finished it.

35:10.177 --> 35:11.471
Finished it?

35:12.180 --> 35:15.724
I'll probably be dead by then.
Talk about a labor of love.

35:15.724 --> 35:17.686
We almost had to take out
a second mortgage

35:17.686 --> 35:19.730
until he found that nice benefactor.

35:20.063 --> 35:23.065
- What was their name again?
- Let me make us some tea.

35:23.984 --> 35:26.278
Okay. Yeah, that sounds lovely.

35:33.285 --> 35:34.702
I told you I'm very busy.

35:34.702 --> 35:37.956
I'm with Mike's parents
in what turns out to be their house.

35:37.956 --> 35:40.417
He had to move in with them
because he is hard up for cash.

35:40.417 --> 35:42.877
So I guess he wasn't lying
about being blackmailed.

35:42.877 --> 35:44.545
Bet Kate likes that even more.

35:44.545 --> 35:47.340
I think Mike's mom
might know the person who...

35:50.301 --> 35:51.260
It's my mom.

35:51.844 --> 35:53.513
Hope you like chamomile!

35:53.513 --> 35:56.390
Who doesn't like chamomile, am I right?

35:59.853 --> 36:01.061
Why are you stopping?

36:01.061 --> 36:03.440
Oh, I wish I didn't have to,
but we have to go.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.941
- Where? Now?
- Right away.

36:04.941 --> 36:06.317
We're gonna catch Gossip Girl.

36:09.321 --> 36:11.155
I don't care what you're doing here.
You need to leave.

36:11.489 --> 36:13.115
Why are you breaking
into your own house?

36:13.115 --> 36:15.159
Come here. Keep quiet. Come here.

36:21.415 --> 36:22.376
Ja, hallo.

36:36.680 --> 36:38.350
A challenger approaches...

36:38.850 --> 36:41.645
I don't think those downers are working.

36:42.062 --> 36:45.315
In fact, for the last fifteen minutes,
I think it's doing the exact opposite.

36:45.315 --> 36:47.859
Oh, my God. I thought it was just me.

36:47.859 --> 36:49.151
Are you sure that was Ativan?

36:49.151 --> 36:52.321
No. I think I fucked up
and gave us Cialis.

36:52.321 --> 36:54.240
I didn't want to say anything
in case I was wrong.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.449
It's starting to get painful.

36:55.449 --> 36:58.662
And I read somewhere that if it lasts
for longer than four hours,

36:58.662 --> 37:00.579
- you have to drain it with a needle.
- No.

37:01.038 --> 37:03.582
- Can you just make sure it looks okay?
- Yeah.

37:11.216 --> 37:13.008
Whatever this is, it's a bad idea.

37:14.135 --> 37:15.136
I need to hear this.

37:20.349 --> 37:21.560
How does it look?

37:21.560 --> 37:24.229
Exquisite.
I think you're gonna be okay, Ak.

37:25.563 --> 37:26.982
Thank God Audrey isn't here.

37:26.982 --> 37:28.358
- Yeah.
- Thank God, indeed.

37:28.859 --> 37:31.069
I'll leave you both to it.
Julien, we're leaving!

37:31.902 --> 37:33.155
- Wait!
- Julien?

37:35.782 --> 37:36.783
Julien!

37:37.325 --> 37:38.368
Julien, we're leaving. Let's go.

37:38.368 --> 37:41.287
- Wait, Audrey! Just hold on.
- Wait, wait, Audrey, seriously!

37:41.287 --> 37:43.123
- Julien!
- It's not what it looks like, I swear.

37:43.123 --> 37:44.583
- Audrey!
- Ein moment, Daniela.

37:46.417 --> 37:47.418
Julien.

37:56.427 --> 37:58.012
Whatever it is you're doing, it's bad.

37:58.012 --> 37:59.555
Yeah, I don't know
what you're doing here, Julien.

37:59.555 --> 38:00.766
But I'm sure it's just as bad, okay?

38:00.766 --> 38:03.142
Audrey! Audrey! Audrey! Wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:07.938 --> 38:09.066
And the gang is all here.

38:11.525 --> 38:12.736
I knew that once I started to get close,

38:12.736 --> 38:15.696
Gossip Girl would feel the heat
and start digging into me.

38:15.696 --> 38:19.618
So I set a trap. If I'm right,
and the account is run by teachers,

38:19.618 --> 38:21.578
then they'll have access
to my personnel file.

38:21.578 --> 38:23.537
The only place with my real address.

38:23.537 --> 38:25.956
And what's at your real address?

38:26.582 --> 38:29.961
My mother. Who, according
to the text she just sent me,

38:29.961 --> 38:33.339
is having tea with a mystery
Constance teacher called Adam.

38:37.219 --> 38:40.763
- Hey, are you with me or not?
- Of course. I'm with you.

38:40.763 --> 38:42.015
Come on. Let's go.

38:43.724 --> 38:48.938
What? I have been teaching P.E. for...

38:50.440 --> 38:51.483
years.

38:51.983 --> 38:55.612
I think physical education
is the most important...

38:57.197 --> 38:58.322
education.

39:08.874 --> 39:10.627
Why won't you listen to our explanation?

39:10.627 --> 39:13.380
I don't need an explanation.
I just caught you on your knees.

39:13.380 --> 39:15.298
- You said it was okay!
- And I thought it was!

39:15.298 --> 39:17.675
But then I thought about it.
About how much more

39:17.675 --> 39:20.137
you two have in common.
I'm the outlier. I'm not like you.

39:20.137 --> 39:22.097
- We know.
- We don't want you to be like us.

39:22.097 --> 39:23.807
You just did it
and you didn't even realize it.

39:23.807 --> 39:25.767
- What?
- You speak as "we"

39:25.767 --> 39:29.396
and I'm out here alone.
Or at least that's how it feels.

39:29.396 --> 39:32.231
I mean, you guys get
your fucking boys' trips. What do I get?

39:32.231 --> 39:33.441
Audrey, are you serious?

39:33.441 --> 39:38.238
Look, I watched my mom fall apart
when her two most important people

39:38.238 --> 39:40.156
cut her out and continued on without her.

39:40.156 --> 39:41.992
How am I supposed to know
that's not gonna happen to me?

39:41.992 --> 39:44.536
We would never do that to you.
I would never do that to you.

39:44.536 --> 39:47.706
You just did it again.
It's either "I" or "we."

39:47.706 --> 39:50.375
It's not "us." It's not "all for all"
or "none for none."

39:50.375 --> 39:52.419
We're one, and one, and one.

39:54.004 --> 39:56.465
In any relationship,
you can only guarantee

39:56.465 --> 40:00.968
you're on the same page in the beginning
and after that, it's anyone's guess.

40:00.968 --> 40:03.930
Look. There's no rules
to this thing, okay?

40:03.930 --> 40:04.973
We're just...

40:05.974 --> 40:10.394
- We're just making it up as we go along.
- Yeah. So maybe we hang out in pairs,

40:10.394 --> 40:13.063
so there's no pressure on the three
of us to show up equally?

40:13.063 --> 40:16.318
Yeah. Or maybe we only hang out
when it is the three of us?

40:16.985 --> 40:18.320
Or maybe we just talk more.

40:20.447 --> 40:23.324
I mean we hang out,
we have sex, but I don't...

40:23.324 --> 40:24.950
I don't know where we are, you know?

40:25.534 --> 40:29.080
Okay, then new rule.
We check in on each other once a week.

40:29.080 --> 40:30.290
Sunday.

40:30.290 --> 40:33.793
Fine. Sundays are great.
And then we talk. All of us.

40:33.793 --> 40:38.799
About everything, even if it's hard.
Even if it's dark and scary. Promise?

40:38.799 --> 40:42.969
Okay. Well, can I start?
Because I'm scared.

40:43.387 --> 40:44.971
I want to make sure that we're okay.

40:45.972 --> 40:46.931
Let's talk and see.

40:56.358 --> 40:58.485
- Well?
- Order number 25.

40:58.943 --> 41:01.154
- Well...
- Oh, come on.

41:02.446 --> 41:04.490
- Okay, it's amazing.
- Told ya!

41:04.866 --> 41:06.117
You'll feel better in no time.

41:07.118 --> 41:09.996
I once wrote a poem
about that exact cheesesteak.

41:11.206 --> 41:12.832
I'm sorry, you wrote a poem?

41:12.832 --> 41:16.627
- Oh, she's judgy. Got it.
- I'm sorry.

41:17.963 --> 41:21.508
What else should I know
about Monet de Haan?

41:26.596 --> 41:27.806
Did your sister ever text you back?

41:28.556 --> 41:31.642
- Radio silence.
- Yeah, same with Shan-- Sabrina.

41:33.437 --> 41:34.687
We should go find that party.

41:35.063 --> 41:37.107
I know Cory.
By the time we get to that party,

41:37.107 --> 41:38.983
she'll have already moved on
to the next one.

41:38.983 --> 41:41.445
We could chase 'em
around Philly all night,

41:41.945 --> 41:44.697
or I could read you some poems?

41:45.991 --> 41:47.492
Does that usually work with girls?

41:47.867 --> 41:51.747
It's my first time trying.
I'll let you know in five,

41:52.121 --> 41:56.208
four, three, two...

42:01.673 --> 42:04.801
Well, Otto... what do you have
to say for yourself?

42:05.593 --> 42:07.512
What exactly do you think
you're doing this time?

42:07.512 --> 42:11.558
I know about Jakarta.
All right? It was built improperly

42:11.891 --> 42:14.269
and it's sinking,
just like the San Francisco building,

42:14.269 --> 42:16.437
only at a faster rate.
And all these lawsuits?

42:17.438 --> 42:19.565
I know that you and Daniela
are up to something.

42:19.565 --> 42:21.150
She's the project manager, isn't she?

42:21.150 --> 42:22.569
Verdammt nochmal, Otto!

42:22.903 --> 42:24.529
Why can't you just leave us alone?

42:29.826 --> 42:31.244
Is that what you want?

42:32.203 --> 42:33.162
I wish I didn't.

42:38.000 --> 42:40.337
Well, that's what I want, too.

42:40.961 --> 42:42.964
Fine. You want out?

42:45.091 --> 42:46.801
- Your wish is granted.
- Good.

42:49.345 --> 42:50.805
Are you sure
you've thought this through?

42:50.805 --> 42:53.225
We don't know what we're getting into.
It could be dangerous!

42:53.225 --> 42:54.475
No more dangerous
than what happens to me

42:54.475 --> 42:56.727
if I don't get Gossip Girl's name
by the end of the night.

42:56.727 --> 42:58.563
Can we please just discuss this?

42:58.939 --> 43:01.525
Mikey, you're home!
You just missed your friend.

43:01.525 --> 43:03.025
What? Wait, where'd he go?

43:03.025 --> 43:05.611
He got a text,
he said it was an emergency.

43:07.655 --> 43:08.697
You tipped him off.

43:09.950 --> 43:11.118
I've been with you this whole time.

43:11.118 --> 43:15.038
Yeah, trying to slow me down. You're--
You've been working with Gossip Girl.

43:15.038 --> 43:17.039
- Or you are her?
- Gossip what?

43:17.791 --> 43:21.002
My thoughts exactly.
I can't believe you, Mike.

43:21.002 --> 43:23.337
- What?
- I really thought we had something here.

43:23.337 --> 43:26.174
- No.
- You clearly only care about yourself.

43:26.799 --> 43:27.801
Wait.

43:33.097 --> 43:35.182
It felt like we were back
in middle school.

43:40.063 --> 43:41.939
You must think my life is chaotic.

43:41.939 --> 43:44.066
Believe me, I'm not one to judge.

43:44.401 --> 43:47.070
In fact, there's something
I wanted to tell you

43:47.070 --> 43:49.280
about me and my wife.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.116
I don't think I can take another story

43:51.116 --> 43:54.870
about how perfect she is
or what your first date was or--

43:54.870 --> 43:55.995
We're separated.

43:57.121 --> 43:58.331
Are you fucking with me?

43:59.248 --> 44:00.959
I didn't want to tell you,
because I didn't want you to think

44:00.959 --> 44:03.545
it had anything to do with you.
Which it doesn't.

44:03.961 --> 44:07.424
And if I said it, it would sound
like I was lying. Which I'm not.

44:08.884 --> 44:11.011
We've both known for a while it's over.

44:12.387 --> 44:14.556
It just took one of us to say it out loud.

44:21.145 --> 44:22.188
Play me something.

44:31.865 --> 44:35.117
Everything in my life
feels so out of control.

44:36.160 --> 44:40.331
My dad, my sister, my best friend,

44:41.124 --> 44:44.460
my ex, Gossip Girl, you.

44:46.922 --> 44:51.258
Nothing feels safe.
Nothing feels... stable.

44:52.094 --> 44:56.138
I just want one moment where
I can close my eyes and be present

44:56.597 --> 44:58.099
without worrying about...

44:59.017 --> 45:02.562
if it's real, or good, or right.

45:04.396 --> 45:05.690
Just one.

46:07.376 --> 46:10.045
- Hey, good morning.
- Wassup?

46:13.632 --> 46:17.095
Sounds like your sister
and Sabrina got in pretty late last night.

46:19.765 --> 46:21.098
Maybe we should grab some breakfast?

46:21.098 --> 46:23.477
I want to try that Wawa egg sandwich
from your haiku.

46:24.602 --> 46:26.228
I can't. I'm busy.

46:27.396 --> 46:29.149
Oh, okay. Yeah, that's fine.

46:31.109 --> 46:34.153
- Maybe another time.
- Yeah, sure.

46:38.115 --> 46:40.118
Do not accept a drink called an AMF.

46:40.118 --> 46:42.495
And definitely do not follow it
with the letters...

46:43.370 --> 46:44.331
DMT.

46:53.422 --> 46:55.634
So, how was your night?

46:56.509 --> 46:57.593
Nothing special.

46:58.720 --> 47:00.806
Hey, let's get outta here.
No reason to stay.

47:01.639 --> 47:02.599
Okay.

47:19.741 --> 47:22.160
- Bergmann property, Lewis speaking.
- Hi, Lewis, yeah.

47:22.160 --> 47:23.286
It's Obie Bergmann.

47:23.661 --> 47:26.581
My keycard does not seem to be working.

47:26.581 --> 47:28.165
I have been informed
that you are no longer

47:28.165 --> 47:29.959
permitted access to the building.

47:30.376 --> 47:31.419
Sorry, Mr. Bergmann.

47:34.923 --> 47:39.511
It's time we had a talk
about a scary little word called trust.

47:41.804 --> 47:45.308
Like fortune, wealth,
or anything truly worth having,

47:46.600 --> 47:48.854
you have to give a lot
to receive a little.

47:51.398 --> 47:53.567
But trust can be elusive.

47:54.109 --> 47:59.488
Sometimes we give and give and give,
and get nothing in return.

48:00.407 --> 48:02.409
- I hope you don't mind.
- Why would I mind?

48:03.784 --> 48:06.912
Look, I was just angry. Okay? I still am.

48:06.912 --> 48:07.955
I know.

48:10.458 --> 48:14.128
And I don't want
to be angry anymore. So...

48:15.755 --> 48:17.298
I think I just need some time.

48:18.340 --> 48:22.052
Take it. Just take it near me?

48:43.533 --> 48:44.534
Are you sure about this?

48:45.951 --> 48:47.078
Not even a little bit.

48:49.497 --> 48:50.957
But we deserve to be happy, right?

48:57.672 --> 49:02.886
But in the cold light of day,
you can only ever trust yourself.

49:11.728 --> 49:14.146
Finally! You've been ignoring
my texts all night.

49:14.146 --> 49:15.648
They were a little inflammatory.

49:16.024 --> 49:19.528
Damn right they were.
You went rogue and I almost got caught.

49:19.528 --> 49:21.738
You? I was doing it for you, Kate!

49:22.446 --> 49:24.241
Do not white knight this.

49:24.241 --> 49:27.076
I wouldn't have had to
if you weren't acting irrationally.

49:27.076 --> 49:29.621
You are dating the man hunting
Gossip Girl

49:29.621 --> 49:33.125
when you are, in fact, Gossip Girl.
What you're doing is reckless.

49:33.125 --> 49:35.293
And getting tea with his mother isn't?

49:35.293 --> 49:38.546
She's seen you now!
Wendy and I were really worried.

49:38.546 --> 49:40.714
Granted, she was, like,
three mai tais in, but--

49:41.173 --> 49:43.635
She can tell you herself. Come in!

49:48.181 --> 49:50.724
How did I not see it?
All the secretive texts,

49:50.724 --> 49:52.726
the hushed conversations
in the teacher's lounge,

49:52.726 --> 49:55.813
the way Jordan's always creeping around.
You've been running Gossip Girl together.

49:55.813 --> 49:57.774
- I get how it seems, but--
- You wanna know the worst part?

49:57.774 --> 49:59.567
I liked you, Kate.
I thought you were different.

49:59.567 --> 50:03.070
You were offended
by all the lies and deception, too.

50:04.489 --> 50:06.699
- You're the biggest liar of all.
- Wait, Mike.

50:07.075 --> 50:08.493
Kate's right. It's not what you think.

50:09.326 --> 50:11.495
Okay. Okay, maybe it was
a little what you think.

50:11.495 --> 50:14.291
Yes, Kate realized
I was at your house and tried to warn me.

50:14.291 --> 50:16.167
But only because
she figured out the truth

50:16.167 --> 50:17.878
and wanted to protect me.

50:17.878 --> 50:19.046
What now?

50:19.046 --> 50:23.216
I'm Gossip Girl. Me, alone.
I created the account,

50:23.216 --> 50:26.177
I've been using the school's firewall
to hide my tracks.

50:26.177 --> 50:29.180
I wanted people to notice me.
For Kate to notice me.

50:29.180 --> 50:32.059
Because... I've been noticing her
since the day she started.

50:32.059 --> 50:34.351
But she doesn't see me that way.

50:34.351 --> 50:36.229
So, I thought
that if I could impress her--

50:36.813 --> 50:38.857
Because you are all the things Mike said.

50:39.232 --> 50:41.401
You hate the lies,
you hate the corruption,

50:41.401 --> 50:43.194
you hate how the students behave.

50:44.320 --> 50:47.406
I thought that if I could show you
that I could make a difference...

50:48.325 --> 50:52.036
that you would finally see me
as someone worthy of you.

50:55.123 --> 50:57.501
Jordan Glassberg, computer science.

50:59.586 --> 51:00.586
I have to admit,

51:01.003 --> 51:02.505
I never would've thought
you had it in you.

51:02.505 --> 51:07.343
What happens now? Helena
has me fired? Arrested? Murdered?

51:07.343 --> 51:09.345
Helena? Who is that?

51:10.639 --> 51:12.389
All I know is I'm free.

51:13.141 --> 51:14.351
And you're gonna wish you were

51:14.351 --> 51:16.602
after the person who just got
that text finds you.
