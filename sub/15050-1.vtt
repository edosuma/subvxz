WEBVTT

00:18.769 --> 00:20.737
- Okay, Dolemite, the
warden wants to see you.

00:21.063 --> 00:23.612
- Oh, shit.

00:23.941 --> 00:24.908
What the hell does
that rat-soup-eatin'

00:25.234 --> 00:26.861
motherfucker want with me?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.411
- Come on outta there.

00:28.737 --> 00:30.205
We ain't got all day.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.219
- Sit down, Dolemite.

00:44.586 --> 00:45.633
You can leave.

00:46.046 --> 00:48.640
You know mama, Queen
Bee, here, I'm sure.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.428
You should be very proud of her.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.441
For damn near two years,
she's been bugging

00:54.555 --> 00:56.398
me about your innocence.

00:56.723 --> 00:57.803
You know, a funny thing is,

00:57.891 --> 00:59.814
I'm about to believe her.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.103
What I mean is, we have,
with her help, of course,

01:02.396 --> 01:05.696
stumbled onto some facts
that may set you free.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.827
Of course, they
have to be proven.

01:09.611 --> 01:12.080
And that's where you come in.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.171
Now you're a gambling
man, aren't you?

01:25.168 --> 01:26.841
- It depends on
the game, Warden,

01:27.170 --> 01:29.298
and how high the stakes are.

01:29.631 --> 01:31.111
- Well I might as
well level with you.

01:31.383 --> 01:34.011
The game is rough and
the stake is your life.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.846
But it means the
difference between

01:36.179 --> 01:38.056
being free or rotting
here behind bars

01:38.390 --> 01:41.064
'til someone tries
to set you free.

01:41.393 --> 01:42.753
You know there's
not a lawyer in LA

01:42.936 --> 01:44.813
who'll touch your case.

01:45.147 --> 01:46.147
So what do you say?

01:46.148 --> 01:47.320
You wanna play ball or not?

01:47.983 --> 01:49.610
- Whose team am I on Warden?

01:49.985 --> 01:51.532
And what am I supposed to do?

01:51.862 --> 01:53.142
- Okay, I'll run it down to you.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.910
You're serving a 20 year stretch

01:55.240 --> 01:56.958
<i>for the possession
of stolen furs</i>

01:57.284 --> 01:58.206
and a half a million
dollars worth

01:58.535 --> 01:59.832
of narcotics, right?

02:00.162 --> 02:01.162
- Right.

02:09.880 --> 02:11.882
- Get behind the trees.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.238
- Hold it!

02:29.274 --> 02:30.274
- What do you want man?

02:30.359 --> 02:31.485
- FBI.

02:33.403 --> 02:34.403
- What do you want?

02:34.488 --> 02:35.660
- Open your trunk.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.189
- There's nothin' in my trunk.

02:37.366 --> 02:38.366
Where's your warrant at?

02:38.659 --> 02:41.253
- This is the FBI, this
is my search warrant.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.387
- There's nothin'
in my trunk man.

02:50.712 --> 02:53.386
- Open up the trunk.

03:02.391 --> 03:03.391
- That shit ain't mine.

03:03.558 --> 03:05.435
I don't know how it got there.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.983
- You're under arrest.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.556
- You're gonna have to take me!

03:15.946 --> 03:17.664
- Ah, ah.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.967
- One more move and you're dead!

03:51.398 --> 03:53.526
- This the guy you said would
take an army to capture?

03:53.859 --> 03:55.736
- I thought it would.

03:56.570 --> 03:57.617
You find his stuff?

03:57.946 --> 04:01.325
- Yeah, dope, stolen
furs, everything.

04:04.286 --> 04:06.254
- Well, goodbye boy.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.551
You're off to a
long, long, vacation.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.002
- I got your boy hangin'.

04:12.335 --> 04:15.088
You no-business bond, insecure,

04:15.422 --> 04:18.050
junkyard motherfucker!

04:32.147 --> 04:33.399
- Right on schedule.

04:33.732 --> 04:34.858
- Well good.

04:35.192 --> 04:35.818
Get in the car.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.448
We'll celebrate.

04:52.584 --> 04:54.224
- Well for the two
years you've been here,

04:54.336 --> 04:56.759
the dope traffic in your
neighborhood hasn't changed.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.431
In fact, it's gotten worse.

04:58.757 --> 05:02.682
Guns and dope are being sold
to school children every day.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.934
Black gangs are
killing each other.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.311
Queen Bee, here,
informs me that,

05:07.641 --> 05:09.234
maybe you better
tell him, Queenie.

05:11.228 --> 05:13.822
- Dolemite, it's
real bad out there.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.696
Some gang killed your
nephew the other day.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.493
He was comin' home
the other day,

05:18.819 --> 05:19.945
just him and his girlfriend.

05:20.278 --> 05:21.996
And they wasn't
botherin' nobody.

05:24.074 --> 05:24.950
- Somebody had to
sell the gun to the

05:25.283 --> 05:26.876
lad that pulled the trigger.

05:27.202 --> 05:29.296
He's in jail, but so what.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.170
There's many more
of 'em out there.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.061
- So they killed little Jimmy?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.059
- That's right.

05:47.472 --> 05:48.712
He was walkin' home from school

05:48.932 --> 05:50.434
and he wasn't botherin' nobody.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.360
Just him and his girl.

05:56.189 --> 05:58.612
- What am I supposed
to do, Warden?

05:58.942 --> 06:00.285
- All right, I
understand you know

06:00.610 --> 06:02.157
some of the people we suspect.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.410
And we feel there are
policemen mixed up in it.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.286
Now, I told you the
job was dangerous

06:06.616 --> 06:08.459
and you could lose your life.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.037
But you're tough.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.850
You know how to roll
with the punches.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.920
The name of the
game is stay alive.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.556
Now I've talked to the
governor about you.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.545
There are only four
people who know

06:18.879 --> 06:20.051
why you're on the street.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.054
The governor, Queen Bee, myself,

06:23.383 --> 06:25.431
and one FBI man
that nobody knows

06:25.760 --> 06:27.182
'til the time comes.

06:27.512 --> 06:28.684
So what do you say, Dolemite?

06:29.014 --> 06:30.891
- When do I get
outta here, Warden?

06:31.224 --> 06:32.224
- Tomorrow.

06:32.517 --> 06:34.019
You go back to your cell now
as if nothing's happened.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.150
You'll be released
in the afternoon.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.694
- Thank you, Queen Bee.

06:47.282 --> 06:49.831
- Oh, Dolemite, I'm so happy.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.084
I'ma tell everybody you
comin' home tomorrow.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.419
- Oh, Dolemite.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.253
- Yes, Warden?

07:01.379 --> 07:04.428
- You do know a man by the name
of Willie Green, don't you?

07:04.966 --> 07:08.061
- Some folks
say that Willie Green

07:08.386 --> 07:11.560
was the baddest motherfucker
the world ever seen.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.484
But I want you to
hold onto your seats.

07:14.809 --> 07:15.981
And hold on to them tight.

07:16.311 --> 07:19.565
'Cause you're now gettin'
ready to see the story of me.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.821
Yes, me,

07:22.150 --> 07:23.150
The badass,

07:23.401 --> 07:24.401
Dolemite.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.990
 Oh, he's bad

07:31.326 --> 07:33.545
 The man is out of sight

07:33.870 --> 07:35.417
 Mmhmm

07:35.747 --> 07:38.170
 He's a tough son of gun y'all

07:39.376 --> 07:41.674
 The man's name is Dolemite

07:42.045 --> 07:43.137
 Yeah hey

07:43.505 --> 07:45.803
 I heard

07:46.132 --> 07:49.102
 Of his coming,
even before his time

07:49.886 --> 07:51.103
 And I ain't lyin'

07:51.429 --> 07:54.103
 Listen, on the
day that he was born

07:54.432 --> 07:55.775
 His papy wore a sign

07:56.184 --> 07:58.562
 Sayin' Dolemite is here

07:58.895 --> 08:02.650
 And this bad
little brother is mine!

08:02.983 --> 08:04.826
 Yeah hey, hey, hey

08:05.151 --> 08:06.151
 Dolemite

08:06.361 --> 08:08.614
 Mmhmm yeah

08:08.947 --> 08:10.073
 Ah yeah

08:10.407 --> 08:12.205
 You're outta sight

08:14.411 --> 08:16.960
 Dolemite, yeah

08:17.288 --> 08:19.711
 Ah, brother you're all right

08:22.252 --> 08:24.721
 He's here to let
the whole world know

08:25.046 --> 08:26.423
 How bad a man

08:26.756 --> 08:28.383
 Is he

08:28.717 --> 08:29.717
 Yeah

08:29.843 --> 08:31.766
 So won't you stop

08:32.095 --> 08:34.347
 Look and listen Dolemite is here

08:34.681 --> 08:37.150
 for you all to see

08:37.475 --> 08:41.105
 Mmhmm

08:55.660 --> 08:58.004
- Damn, look like
my women is on time.

08:59.205 --> 09:02.084
Goddamn, Mama, you must
be new on my scene.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.543
I am.

09:03.877 --> 09:04.877
- What's your name?

09:04.919 --> 09:06.512
- It's Chi, short for Chicago.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.136
- I hope you ain't as
cold as the windy city,

09:09.466 --> 09:10.746
because the way I feel now baby,

09:11.009 --> 09:12.306
I could sure warm you up.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.932
- As long as you been gone baby,

09:14.262 --> 09:16.890
you gotta whole lotta
warmin' up to do.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.483
- No shit, baby.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.026
- I can dig it.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.836
I ain't gonna lie.
- Here change this.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.784
- Mmm, mmm, mmm.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.439
Yes baby you can get behind
me and in front of me, too.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.621
Do you dig it?

09:36.034 --> 09:37.034
Whoo!

09:37.118 --> 09:38.118
- You still need these.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.083
- I don't wanna get in
my car with this shit on.

09:40.497 --> 09:42.340
I'm glad y'all brought
my clothes to me.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.592
You see what the guards give me

09:44.959 --> 09:47.087
to get outta jail in.

09:51.382 --> 09:54.101
Bitch, you bring me these
goddamn cotton draws.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.227
You know I don't wear
no fuckin' cotton draws.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.193
Oh, I like these.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.613
Who made this?

10:21.830 --> 10:24.049
You, guard, I want
you to take these

10:24.374 --> 10:27.048
cheap motherfuckers and
wipe your ass with 'em.

10:27.377 --> 10:30.301
- Oh no, Dolemite,
we'll keep 'em here.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.223
You'll be back.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.174
- There they go, let's get 'em.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.525
- Remember, we
want Dolemite dead.

11:28.855 --> 11:30.698
- What about the broads?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.024
- Ah, forget em.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.637
- I think we got company.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.972
We're being tailed.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.188
- Hand me my piece.

12:12.232 --> 12:14.485
Pull over and stop the car.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.785
Pull up aways, I'll
take it from there.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.694
- Alright, girls, turn
the goddamn motor off.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.571
Get out Dolemite!

12:55.900 --> 12:57.140
- Dolemite's not in here.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.918
- Don't give us here
that bullshit, baby.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.663
We know he's here.

13:00.989 --> 13:02.869
- Look
for yourself motherfucker.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.286
- She's tellin' the truth.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.996
He's not here.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.501
- Well where is he?

13:10.832 --> 13:12.084
- Breathin' down your neck.

13:16.087 --> 13:17.088
Alright, hold it, move.

13:17.422 --> 13:18.423
Girls, come here.

13:18.756 --> 13:19.756
Come here, girls.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.528
I've been wantin'
see me a honky dance.

13:21.759 --> 13:22.976
Dance, motherfucker, dance!

13:23.303 --> 13:25.021
Dance!

13:27.015 --> 13:28.517
Dance!

13:28.850 --> 13:32.195
Girls, this motherfucker's
got rhythm, hasn't he?

13:33.771 --> 13:34.891
- Rhythm, rhythm.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.997
- Come on girls, let's make it.

13:47.327 --> 13:48.874
- Help me!

13:49.203 --> 13:50.876
- Wait a minute,
Dolemite, I'll help him.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.303
- Let's go.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.866
- Queen Bee, it's awful
good to be back home.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.072
- I'm glad you're
home, too, baby.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.578
It takes a whole lot
of weight off my back

14:26.908 --> 14:28.034
since you're home.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.166
It's so good you home.

14:30.495 --> 14:31.495
- By the way, Queen Bee,

14:31.704 --> 14:33.251
where are these
guns coming from?

14:33.581 --> 14:36.050
- Dolemite, I
honestly don't know.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.962
You think maybe
it's Willie Green?

14:39.295 --> 14:41.548
- I've known Willie
Green for a long time.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.976
Willie Green plays
for high stakes.

14:45.301 --> 14:47.178
He's into more than guns.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.061
Oh, by the way, Queen Bee,

14:50.390 --> 14:52.484
it looks like somebody's
missin' from the family.

14:52.809 --> 14:55.062
- Oh, yes, Peggy.

14:55.395 --> 14:56.942
She split right after you left.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.319
She's dancin' for
Willie Green right now.

14:59.649 --> 15:03.074
- Speakin' of dancin', who's
taking care of the club now?

15:03.403 --> 15:06.077
You know, I got some
big ideas for that club.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.828
- Wait a minute, wait.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.704
We don't have the club anymore.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.994
- What do you mean we don't
have the club anymore?

15:12.286 --> 15:14.914
You know that club
was my pride and joy

15:15.248 --> 15:17.046
and you've gone and give it up.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.093
- I didn't give away shit.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.966
We lost it.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.343
Me and these girls
had to sell pussy

15:23.673 --> 15:24.890
on the goddamn corner.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.059
Tryin' to save your black ass.

15:27.385 --> 15:29.934
We almost lost this house.

15:30.263 --> 15:31.310
You know what?

15:31.639 --> 15:32.686
Mitchell and White

15:33.015 --> 15:34.688
would bust us every week.

15:35.017 --> 15:36.485
$5,000 a whop.

15:36.811 --> 15:38.688
Until all the money was gone.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.194
And we still owe
Willie Green $50,000.

15:43.401 --> 15:44.994
- Who's runnin' the club now?

15:45.319 --> 15:46.912
- Willie Green.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.238
Lookie here.

15:48.364 --> 15:49.741
You remember Creeper, right?

15:50.074 --> 15:51.394
He's a little old
friend of yours.

15:51.492 --> 15:52.994
Now, he knows a lot of things

15:53.327 --> 15:54.920
and he know a lot of people.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.326
And since he's your friend,

15:56.372 --> 15:57.715
he might be able to
tell you a little somethin'.

15:58.249 --> 15:59.449
Why don't you give him a call?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.298
- Queen Bee, you know darn well

16:01.627 --> 16:05.006
that Creeper ain't never paid
a phone bill in his life.

16:05.339 --> 16:07.182
- True, but you know
where he hang out at.

16:07.508 --> 16:09.886
- Is the Fat Burger
joint still in business?

16:10.219 --> 16:11.391
- Oh, yes.

16:11.721 --> 16:12.841
That's where the penny pimps

16:13.014 --> 16:14.766
and the nickel and
dime hustlers hang out.

16:15.099 --> 16:17.219
When they ain't got no money
and tricks be kinda slow.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.477
But look here.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.690
I noticed that the warden
told you that you'd be alone.

16:22.023 --> 16:24.071
But Dolemite, you
ain't never been alone.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.118
When you were doing your time,

16:26.444 --> 16:28.993
I put your girls
through karate school.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.574
And they are good, too.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.750
I remember one time
a trick came in here

16:33.075 --> 16:34.167
and tried to misuse us.

16:34.494 --> 16:36.041
- What happened to my $100 Joe?

16:36.370 --> 16:38.168
Nigga, did you take my money?

16:38.498 --> 16:41.422
- That's right little bitch.

16:41.751 --> 16:42.968
I took it back.

16:43.294 --> 16:46.264
You ain't worth no $100.

16:48.716 --> 16:50.810
I am Joe Blow, the lover man.

16:51.135 --> 16:53.479
You should be paying me, bitch.

16:53.804 --> 16:54.976
- Give me my money, man.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.309
- Shit, what money?

16:59.685 --> 17:01.045
Shit, I get cunt
like you all clay,

17:01.229 --> 17:03.072
a dime a dozen, shit.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.865
Here, here's $2.

17:05.191 --> 17:06.951
Go get you some dish
powder and keep it clean

17:07.234 --> 17:08.234
for me next time.

17:08.486 --> 17:10.238
- And they whipped his ass.

17:10.570 --> 17:13.665
He's in the hospital yet
with his ass in a sling.

17:13.991 --> 17:15.834
You used to be
pretty good yourself.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.662
- Oh, but Queen Bee,

17:17.994 --> 17:20.214
I think I need mine
brushed up a little bit.

17:20.830 --> 17:21.582
- I'm goin' to change clothes.

17:21.999 --> 17:23.215
Come on, let's go on the
other side the house.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.585
Okay?

17:59.161 --> 18:01.539
- Hey, where's Flo?

18:01.872 --> 18:03.044
- Flo.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.209
- Hi, honey.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.007
- How's tricks?

18:08.337 --> 18:09.463
- Couldn't be better.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.014
Am I gonna see you tonight?

18:11.340 --> 18:12.557
- No, no, no, not now.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.763
I got business to take
care of on the east side.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.011
See ya.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.270
- You always got
business somewhere else

18:17.597 --> 18:18.894
when it comes to me, nigga.

18:19.223 --> 18:21.103
That's the trouble with
you black motherfuckers.

18:21.309 --> 18:22.481
- Hey Flo.
- You get a

18:22.810 --> 18:24.090
fuckin' bitch in your car,
- Flo!

18:24.270 --> 18:25.442
- And then you always
wanna fuck all over her.

18:25.771 --> 18:26.771
<i>'</i> Flo!

18:28.691 --> 18:29.691
- Hello, sweetheart.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.364
Can I help you?

18:31.694 --> 18:33.367
- Yeah, um, I'd like a massage.

18:33.696 --> 18:35.073
Please.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.828
- Well, I think that they're
doin' it right over here baby.

19:28.292 --> 19:30.215
 And here we are together

19:30.544 --> 19:33.548
 Lying side by side

19:33.881 --> 19:36.304
 And my body trembles as you're

19:36.634 --> 19:39.137
 Touching me

19:39.470 --> 19:42.064
 Heartbeat is burnin' baby

19:42.390 --> 19:44.484
 Deep inside of me
- What took you so long?

19:44.809 --> 19:47.904
- How did you know I
was comin' up here baby?

19:48.229 --> 19:49.776
- I thought about
what you told me

19:50.106 --> 19:53.485
so I sent down my little
cool wings to bring you up.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.741
 I feel the power

20:03.119 --> 20:04.416
 I yearn to know ya

20:04.745 --> 20:07.919
 Just to feel the glow of love

20:08.249 --> 20:13.005
 My body's burnin' with desire

20:13.546 --> 20:15.969
 Your sweet caressin'

20:16.298 --> 20:17.618
- I don't know
what you sent Mama,

20:17.842 --> 20:21.722
but it's goddamn sure workin'.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.931
 And I'm on fire

20:24.265 --> 20:26.063
 Woah darling

20:26.392 --> 20:29.862
 I feel the power of your love

20:32.064 --> 20:37.321
 I feel the power of your love

20:51.250 --> 20:53.048
- Hold on a minute.

20:55.045 --> 20:57.264
I wanna talk to you Dolemite.

21:03.220 --> 21:06.019
- Man, move over and let me pass

21:06.348 --> 21:08.148
before I have to be
pullin' these hush puppies

21:08.476 --> 21:10.854
out your motherfuckin' ass.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.482
- Alright, get your
hands on your head, boy.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.033
- What the shit is this?

21:20.362 --> 21:22.282
- Just spin around and
put your hands on the car.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.292
- Oh, fuck, I
ain't done nothin'.

21:26.494 --> 21:27.120
- No, you haven't yet,

21:27.453 --> 21:28.921
but you will.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.759
- Well, well, what have we here?

21:35.586 --> 21:37.884
- Oh, Lordy, let me see that.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.467
Oh, wow.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.428
This looks like the
real stuff all right.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.263
Ah.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.392
Oh, yeah, that's good.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.568
That's the real McCoy all right.

21:54.104 --> 21:55.104
What about this boy?

21:55.356 --> 21:56.653
- What about what?

21:56.982 --> 21:58.859
- You must be high
or somethin' fella.

21:59.193 --> 22:00.069
I'm talking about
all the dope I found

22:00.402 --> 22:01.870
<i>under your seat.</i>

22:02.196 --> 22:03.996
And there's more stashed
where that came from.

22:04.281 --> 22:06.830
- Now you just got through
doin' time for stuff,

22:07.159 --> 22:09.662
and now here you are,
right back at it again.

22:09.995 --> 22:13.340
- Another frame up, hmm.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.047
- That's right.

22:17.211 --> 22:18.554
Now I'm gonna warn you,

22:18.879 --> 22:20.005
but only one time.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.059
See they told us that
you're a troublemaker.

22:22.299 --> 22:23.516
That you're no good.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.763
That you don't know how
to get along with people.

22:27.096 --> 22:29.190
Now, I know you
think you're smart,

22:29.515 --> 22:31.235
see, 'cause you got all
them flashy clothes,

22:31.350 --> 22:33.023
you got that big car there,

22:33.352 --> 22:35.480
and you got all them black
bitches workin' for ya.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.360
- You forgot about
the white ones.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.283
- You move your ass
outta this town,

22:39.608 --> 22:41.610
and you move it fast.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.740
- You better listen to him, boy.

22:46.073 --> 22:48.622
Don't and somethin'
nasty's gonna happen to ya.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.168
- And just to show ya
that we mean business...

23:27.031 --> 23:29.659
- That's for fuckin' with
me, you no-business-born

23:29.992 --> 23:32.040
insecure motherfuckers!

23:47.468 --> 23:49.015
- I'll have that
stupid son of a bitch

23:49.345 --> 23:51.689
in jail in two hours.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.145
- Just look at that
damn Watergate scandal.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.241
Now, if the leader
of our country

24:02.566 --> 24:04.944
is stealing and
getting away clean,

24:05.277 --> 24:07.450
what the hell do
they expect us to do?

24:07.780 --> 24:08.900
- Better believe it brother.

24:09.114 --> 24:09.580
- Right on.

24:09.907 --> 24:10.907
- Tell the truth!

24:11.200 --> 24:13.419
- And they've got
everything going for them,

24:13.744 --> 24:15.542
and we've got nothing.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.712
- He can tell
us whether he will or not.

24:25.047 --> 24:29.598
- Remember, we live here
with the rats and roaches.

24:29.927 --> 24:31.967
So we don't need no more
rats telling us what to do.

24:32.137 --> 24:33.138
Amen.

24:33.472 --> 24:35.270
- We will create our own war,

24:35.683 --> 24:36.723
- Right on.
- That's right.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.445
- And we don't need
no redneck mother,

24:39.770 --> 24:41.818
oh yes, Lord.

24:42.147 --> 24:46.152
Mothers are the best
friends we have.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.485
And Oh Lord,

24:47.569 --> 24:49.867
look down

24:50.197 --> 24:52.950
on us poor servants down here.

24:53.283 --> 24:56.787
And teach us how to
love one another.

24:57.788 --> 24:59.631
- All right, Reverend,
cut the bullshit.

25:00.416 --> 25:02.776
You probably been up here callin'
us every name in the book.

25:02.835 --> 25:03.882
At ease, boys.

25:04.211 --> 25:06.760
Ain't nobody down here
for you this time.

25:07.089 --> 25:07.464
We're lookin' for Dolemite.

25:07.798 --> 25:08.924
You seen him or not?

25:09.258 --> 25:10.931
- No, I haven't.

25:11.260 --> 25:13.888
But if I see him,
I'll let him know

25:14.221 --> 25:16.019
that you're looking for him.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.976
- Ah, that's mighty
black of you, Reverend.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.936
Mike, check out the back.

25:21.270 --> 25:22.943
I know you won't mind us
havin' a look around, will ya?

25:23.272 --> 25:23.898
- No, no, go right ahead.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.574
- Thank you.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.664
- Hey, Preacher.

25:35.993 --> 25:37.836
What do you got here?

25:38.162 --> 25:40.085
- Oh, just some old
clothes for the poor.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.812
- Old, dirty clothes, huh?

25:55.137 --> 25:57.515
I'd hate to pay
your laundry bill.

25:57.848 --> 25:58.849
Hey, Mitch.

25:59.183 --> 26:01.311
Come here and look at
the man's old clothes.

26:05.189 --> 26:08.113
- Ah, now Reverend, what
the hell is all this?

26:08.442 --> 26:10.035
Now where'd you
get all these guns?

26:10.360 --> 26:13.159
- They're just gifts
from the big man.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.706
For the fourth ward.

26:15.032 --> 26:17.785
In case of trouble
from the niggas.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.207
- Okay, I'll check that out.

26:20.704 --> 26:22.251
Um, uh,

26:22.790 --> 26:23.950
I ain't seen nothing yet, uh,

26:24.083 --> 26:25.083
did you see anything yet?

26:25.334 --> 26:26.335
- Not me.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.046
- Okay, carry on, Reverend,

26:29.421 --> 26:30.421
uh if you see Dolemite...

26:31.340 --> 26:32.887
- I'll tell him you're
looking for him.

26:35.427 --> 26:36.804
- Yeah, right.

26:38.055 --> 26:39.272
Okay.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.905
- What else with
your burger, creeper?

26:47.231 --> 26:49.984
- Uh, give me a
small coke and, uh,

26:50.317 --> 26:51.317
some french fries.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.571
- You know we don't
sell french fries.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.872
- Ah, that's right,
that's right.

26:56.198 --> 26:57.791
Yeah, anyway, uh,

26:58.700 --> 27:01.499
ah, see somebody beat
me for my money.

27:02.371 --> 27:03.451
Don't look at me like that.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.385
Every time I come
around here, you know it.

27:05.707 --> 27:07.675
Call the police, you
think I'm jivin'.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.173
Just do that.

27:09.503 --> 27:10.550
<i>'</i> Nigga. Please.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.051
- Ah, yeah, well, uh,

27:12.381 --> 27:13.381
I understand, uh,

27:13.632 --> 27:15.100
is it alright if I
pay you tomorrow?

27:15.425 --> 27:16.472
Hustle's good.

27:16.802 --> 27:18.242
- Okay Creeper here,
I'll pay for it.

27:18.387 --> 27:19.730
You're holdin' up business.

27:20.055 --> 27:21.728
- Alright, sista,
right on, right on.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.057
Boy, you know what?

27:23.225 --> 27:23.896
That's sweetened bear meat.

27:24.226 --> 27:25.226
Gonna marry it too.

27:25.477 --> 27:26.477
How's that?

27:26.603 --> 27:27.603
Sweetened bear meat.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.238
- Alright.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.472
- Say, brotha, hey.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.515
Will you tell this

27:55.841 --> 27:57.093
I bet him $5 you Dolemite.

27:57.426 --> 27:58.678
- Yes, brotha, I'm Dolemite.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.012
- Prove it, prove it.

28:00.345 --> 28:01.392
Listen man,

28:01.722 --> 28:04.896
I'm not accustomed to
doing shows on the street.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.853
I am openin' town this weekend.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.063
And I'd appreciate
it if you brothers

28:09.396 --> 28:10.836
get together and
come out and see me.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.336
- Man, I ain't got
that kind of money.

28:12.357 --> 28:13.477
This nigga say you Dolemite.

28:13.525 --> 28:14.885
I bet him my last five dollas man.

28:15.027 --> 28:16.027
Now I'm the one losin'.

28:16.320 --> 28:18.118
- Brothers, I have
business to take care of.

28:19.072 --> 28:20.073
I'm sorry.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.000
- Man, play this track man,

28:22.326 --> 28:23.686
so I don't lose my
last $5, please?

28:23.869 --> 28:25.041
- Alright, man, alright.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.088
- Right on, right on.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.961
- One beautiful day in
the merry month of May.

28:32.294 --> 28:35.013
Great Titanic, sailed away.

28:36.089 --> 28:39.138
The captain and the lieutenant
was havin' a few words,

28:40.219 --> 28:42.893
When the great Titanic
hit that mighty iceberg.

28:44.765 --> 28:47.234
Shine was in the boiler
room eatin' some peas,

28:48.602 --> 28:50.855
black-eyed peas, it was.

28:51.188 --> 28:54.112
And the water came
damn near to his knees.

28:54.441 --> 28:56.034
Before Shine could
take a bite of bread,

28:56.360 --> 29:00.456
that water come darn
near up to his head.

29:01.448 --> 29:02.620
Shine run up on the deck,

29:02.950 --> 29:04.270
said, "Captain,
captain, captain",

29:04.368 --> 29:07.121
"that water's damn
near up to my neck."

29:07.454 --> 29:09.294
Captain said, "Shine,
go back, pack the sacks."

29:09.498 --> 29:12.342
We gotta enough sacks,
to keep this water back."

29:15.170 --> 29:17.844
You standin' up here, steady
bullshittin' and drinkin',

29:18.548 --> 29:22.428
but can't you see this raggedy
hunk-a-junk is slowly sinkin'?

29:24.513 --> 29:26.891
I said, "Cap I'll be in
New York unpackin' my trunk"

29:27.266 --> 29:28.466
when the news reach the world,

29:28.475 --> 29:30.648
"this junk done sunk."

29:33.522 --> 29:36.241
The captain said, "Shine,
go back and fear no doubt",

29:36.566 --> 29:39.285
'fore I take this
two-by-four and whack your

29:39.611 --> 29:40.828
"black ass out."

29:43.282 --> 29:44.408
Shine said, "Captain",

29:44.741 --> 29:47.540
this shit you talkin'
mighta once been true,

29:47.869 --> 29:50.964
but this is one time
your motherfuckin' talk

29:51.290 --> 29:53.759
"ain't gonna do."

29:54.084 --> 29:56.553
Shine just run and
jumped up in the ocean,

29:56.878 --> 29:59.131
with his black ass doin'
a back wheel in motion.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.553
I said, "Cap all these
rich broads run"

30:04.886 --> 30:06.354
and jumped up on the top."

30:07.389 --> 30:09.312
One broad hollered,
"Shine, stop!"

30:09.641 --> 30:12.019
All this good stuff
to you I'll give

30:12.352 --> 30:14.605
"if you make it possible
for me to live."

30:16.398 --> 30:19.117
Shine said, "Bitch",

30:20.402 --> 30:23.030
I like your shape
and I like your plan,

30:24.156 --> 30:26.329
but you shoulda been
offering me your stuff

30:26.658 --> 30:27.784
"when we was on dry land."

30:32.581 --> 30:35.175
If I was in Mississippi and
asked you for a piece of trim,

30:35.459 --> 30:37.336
you woulda had my
black ass hangin' from

30:37.669 --> 30:39.797
the highest limb.

30:40.797 --> 30:41.923
Is that enough fellas?

30:42.257 --> 30:43.600
- No, no, Oh no, not that.

30:44.051 --> 30:45.051
- Alright.

30:45.302 --> 30:46.599
- Goddamn right, I got two.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.431
- Here come another
broad out hollerin'.

30:49.765 --> 30:50.687
Hollerin', "Shine, Shine, Shine."

30:51.016 --> 30:51.642
I'm the captain's wife.

30:51.975 --> 30:53.455
Why won't you help
me to save my life?

30:53.769 --> 30:55.129
I've been through
the cotton fields

30:55.270 --> 30:56.988
and I waded through the mills.

30:57.314 --> 30:58.736
And, honey, I'm
a soul sista, baby

30:59.066 --> 31:01.865
"and we from the same blood."

31:04.196 --> 31:06.244
"You can talk so sweet
and you can sing so fine,"

31:06.573 --> 31:07.853
but you shouldn't
of brought your

31:08.033 --> 31:10.456
high yellow ass across
that darn color line.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.465
But I'm the one you call
the boiler room flunkie,

31:15.791 --> 31:16.991
now keep your ass on this ship

31:17.209 --> 31:19.052
"and drown with these honkeys!"

31:22.255 --> 31:23.848
When the news got around
the world that the great Titanic

31:24.174 --> 31:26.552
had hit this big iceberg,

31:26.885 --> 31:27.885
Shine was in Chicago,

31:28.136 --> 31:29.763
on Cottage Grove and 63rd.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.097
- Yeah.

31:31.139 --> 31:32.391
- Down on his knees,
"There a nickle I shoot"

31:32.724 --> 31:34.692
and a dime I hope to pass.

31:35.352 --> 31:37.195
I left 10,000 rich motherfuckers

31:37.562 --> 31:38.859
"swingin' on they ass."

31:40.440 --> 31:43.614
And everybody wondered why
Shine didn't drown.

31:44.694 --> 31:46.492
He had a card stuck
up in his butt

31:46.822 --> 31:48.415
and he couldn't go down.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.470
Well, if it isn't
the hamburger pimp.

32:05.882 --> 32:07.600
Say, hamburger pimp.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.349
- Hey fella, look here, you
don't know me man.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.558
Who you talkin' to anyway?

32:13.890 --> 32:15.813
You better get on before
you get jumped on.

32:16.143 --> 32:18.612
- Now who bad enough
to do all of that?

32:18.895 --> 32:20.818
- Me, nigga, me.

32:21.148 --> 32:24.322
Shit, I'm so bad, I kick
my own ass twice a day.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.619
Shit, he ain't sayin' nothin'.

32:26.945 --> 32:27.945
Dolemite?

32:28.155 --> 32:29.156
- Dolemite goddamn,

32:29.489 --> 32:31.116
- Why you wanna do
me like that man?

32:31.450 --> 32:33.010
Come on and let me
buy you a drink, huh?

32:33.201 --> 32:35.420
- Are you sure
you can afford it?

32:36.538 --> 32:38.461
- When'd you get out, mane?

32:38.790 --> 32:40.463
- Yesterday.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.090
- Say, boy this must be
my day hustlin' em good,

32:43.628 --> 32:45.148

32:45.380 --> 32:47.474

32:47.966 --> 32:49.388
Fucked up brother.

32:49.885 --> 32:52.479
Oh nigga Willie Green.

32:53.013 --> 32:54.515
Your new boy lookin' like, uh,

32:54.848 --> 32:56.208
I mean when you was on the street,

32:56.725 --> 32:57.726
everything was cool man.

32:58.185 --> 32:59.107
Now they're scared to
wipe their asses man

32:59.436 --> 33:00.436
you know, and anyway.

33:01.980 --> 33:03.380
They so cold they
on upped the price

33:03.523 --> 33:05.525
on stuff so high.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.032
You understand that an
honest dude like me,

33:08.361 --> 33:10.784
I'm just snatchin' pocketbooks all
day to stay fixed, mane.

33:11.114 --> 33:12.491
You know?

33:13.074 --> 33:14.997
- Creeper,

33:15.327 --> 33:17.421
let me make a deal with you.

33:17.746 --> 33:19.874
I hear that a lot
of shit has been

33:20.207 --> 33:22.881
going down since I left.

33:23.210 --> 33:24.930
And if you can whoop
some information on me,

33:25.253 --> 33:27.972
you won't have to
worry about your fix.

33:28.298 --> 33:30.221
I'll whoop some
bread on your man.

33:30.550 --> 33:31.927
Can you dig it?

33:32.260 --> 33:33.933
- Yeah, that's cool.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.856
Anyway, let's go to my pad, man.

33:37.182 --> 33:38.399
- Where do you live man?

33:38.725 --> 33:39.066
- Why man?

33:39.434 --> 33:40.606
Is that cool?

33:40.936 --> 33:43.485
- Let's move away from

33:43.813 --> 33:44.813
- Alright.

34:27.315 --> 34:31.821
- Hey, nigga, where

35:19.951 --> 35:21.874
- Creeper, I've known
you a long time.

35:22.203 --> 35:23.796
You've been shootin' that shit.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.925
Man, if you keep on,
it's gonna kill ya.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.049
- I'm gonna cut it loose bro.

35:30.378 --> 35:31.971
This my last one.

35:32.297 --> 35:34.891
Ugh, right there.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.224
That they gonna die on me

35:43.558 --> 35:45.356
just like they did
little Jimmy, man.

35:45.685 --> 35:47.358
- What do you know
about little Jimmy?

35:47.687 --> 35:49.815
Do you know who
killed Jimmy, man?

35:50.148 --> 35:50.523
Who killed little Jimmy?

35:50.857 --> 35:52.200
Do you know, man?

35:52.525 --> 35:53.525
<i>- Oh WW-</i>

35:53.735 --> 35:55.015
You ought to take a hit of this.

35:55.111 --> 35:56.363
This some good stuff.

35:56.696 --> 35:58.118
Mm.

35:59.115 --> 36:00.287
- Wake up Creeper!

36:01.910 --> 36:04.163
Wake up, man!

36:04.496 --> 36:05.998
Wake up!

36:06.331 --> 36:07.503
Wake up, man!

36:07.832 --> 36:08.832
Who killed Jimmy?

36:08.917 --> 36:09.383
- Wait a minute, man.

36:09.709 --> 36:10.130
Wait a minute.

36:10.460 --> 36:11.460
- Man, who done it?

36:11.670 --> 36:12.045
Who done it?

36:12.379 --> 36:14.507
Who killed Jimmy?

36:14.839 --> 36:15.431
- Lighten up, bra,

36:15.757 --> 36:16.837
I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.017
Man, wait a minute, man.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.343
Damn.

36:19.594 --> 36:20.874
It had to do with business stuff

36:21.054 --> 36:23.352
over at the schoolhouse,
man, and uh,

36:23.682 --> 36:25.480
he wanted out, man, and uh,

36:25.809 --> 36:26.856
they wouldn't let him.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.358
He went to the police, you know.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.861
It didn't do no good.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.067
One day, he was on
his way to the pad.

36:34.401 --> 36:37.280
Lowriders passed by,
man, and blow him up.

36:37.612 --> 36:39.580
You know, I'm comin'
outta the pawn shop.

36:39.906 --> 36:41.749
You know, I seen it all.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.435
<i>I was comm' out
the pawn shop, man.</i>

36:43.576 --> 36:43.997
That's what happened.

36:44.327 --> 36:45.749
That's the truth man.

37:25.827 --> 37:28.546
- Alright, you're
under arrest, Dolemite.

37:29.914 --> 37:32.793
Don't try any of
your funny shit now.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.651
If he makes a wrong move, kill him.

37:35.628 --> 37:37.301
- What's the charge
this time, man?

37:37.630 --> 37:39.052
- This time it's murder.

37:39.382 --> 37:40.382
Stick your hands out.

37:40.425 --> 37:42.348
- It looks more like
slaughter to me.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.335
- Reverend.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.340
Reverend Gibbs, police officer.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.597
Reverend Gibbs.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.143
- It's the police.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.475
Okay, I'm comin'.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.026
- It's about time.

38:32.352 --> 38:33.979
- Just shut up
and hide your black ass.

38:34.312 --> 38:34.904
Be right there.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.732
- Don't you curse me, Reverend.

38:45.031 --> 38:45.623
- Police officer, Reverend.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.082
- Yes, yes I know.

38:48.535 --> 38:49.855
I want to ask you
a few questions.

38:50.245 --> 38:52.168
Maybe you can help clear
up a few things for me.

38:52.497 --> 38:53.999
- At your service.

38:54.332 --> 38:57.006
- Two white police officers
came by to see you, right?

38:58.127 --> 38:59.424
- That's right.

38:59.754 --> 39:00.754
- What did they want?

39:01.047 --> 39:02.424
- They were lookin' for Dolemite

39:02.757 --> 39:03.837
and thought I had seem him.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.223
- Why would they, uh,
look for Dolemite here?

39:06.553 --> 39:10.148
- You know, I thought
about that myself.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.942
- Say, do you know Willie Green?

39:13.268 --> 39:15.862
- Oh, I see him around.

39:16.187 --> 39:17.187
Now and then.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.322
- Well, I'm gonna
give you a chance

39:18.648 --> 39:20.446
to level with me, Reverend.

39:20.775 --> 39:21.401
Who do you work for?

39:21.734 --> 39:23.862
Willie Green or Dolemite?

39:24.195 --> 39:27.039
- I work for nobody
but the Lord.

39:27.365 --> 39:30.460
Because he said, "Blessed
are the pure at heart."

39:30.785 --> 39:33.208
Amen!

39:34.163 --> 39:35.915
- Are you pure at
heart, Reverend?

39:36.249 --> 39:37.546
- Yes, sir, I am.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.298
Amen.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.504
Hallelujah!

39:41.838 --> 39:44.011
- Then why you hidin' that

39:44.340 --> 39:46.058

39:46.384 --> 39:47.727
The truth shall make you free!

39:48.052 --> 39:49.052
- Well you listen to me,

39:49.262 --> 39:50.684

son of a bitch!

39:51.347 --> 39:53.441
Now I'm tired of your shit.

39:53.766 --> 39:55.109
And let me tell you one thing.

39:55.435 --> 39:57.403
When the shit hits
the fan, Reverend,

39:57.687 --> 39:59.735
you're gonna be dead
down the middle.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.692
And I'm coming after you!

40:17.248 --> 40:20.092
- Queenie, that bitch

Come on, give it up.

Come on, give it up.

40:31.346 --> 40:33.769
Come on, give it up.

Uh uh, give it all up.

40:38.227 --> 40:40.571
- Well I'll be goddamn.

40:40.897 --> 40:42.319
Bitch don't you know?

40:42.649 --> 40:44.743
Nobody steals in Dolemite house.

Get out here!

Get out dumb blonde!

40:51.658 --> 40:54.878
- Dolemite, can I talk

40:55.203 --> 40:56.203
- Go on and talk man.

40:56.245 --> 40:58.498
These are my friends.

41:02.168 --> 41:03.545
- So it's all right, huh?

41:03.878 --> 41:04.878
- Yeah.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.463
- What do you know about
the fourth ward, Dolemite?

41:07.882 --> 41:09.555
- Nothin'.

41:09.884 --> 41:11.761
- How about some very
classy, young girls

41:12.095 --> 41:13.938

41:14.263 --> 41:16.061
And they work for Willie
Green, I understand?

41:16.391 --> 41:17.551
- What do you know about 'em?

41:17.684 --> 41:19.937
- Oh, I seen 'em in action
and they're pretty good.

41:20.269 --> 41:21.862
Do you know Willie Green?

41:22.188 --> 41:23.735
- Oh, fuck you, man.

41:24.065 --> 41:26.534
I don't know no
fuckin' Willie Green.

41:26.859 --> 41:28.953
- Well I'm only
trying to be helpful.

41:29.278 --> 41:29.904
- Oh it's your kinda niggas that

41:30.238 --> 41:32.616
helped me to get in here.

41:32.949 --> 41:34.246
- Well I hope you get out soon.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.538
- Black bitch.

41:45.086 --> 41:46.463
- Dolemite.

41:46.796 --> 41:47.796
" Ho!"

41:47.880 --> 41:48.880
- You're free to go now.

41:49.007 --> 41:50.350
- Oh?

41:50.675 --> 41:53.679
See ya man.

42:13.573 --> 42:16.247
- Hey, taxi Mister?

42:16.576 --> 42:17.828
- Pinky E. Vaughn.

42:18.161 --> 42:19.913
What brings you down?

42:20.246 --> 42:20.997
- Now don't you
worry about that.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.422
Just get in, come on.

42:22.749 --> 42:24.501
- Oh shit yes, my main woman.

42:24.959 --> 42:25.959
- How you doin'?

42:26.294 --> 42:26.795
- Goddamn!

42:27.128 --> 42:28.380
Give me a big kiss.

42:30.339 --> 42:33.138
- Come on, let's go.

42:37.346 --> 42:42.147
 Do you

42:43.394 --> 42:47.865
 Have feelings for me

42:49.150 --> 42:52.074
 Yes, yes I do

42:53.112 --> 42:56.366
 But the distance between

42:56.699 --> 42:59.077
 Our romance

43:01.204 --> 43:02.922
- You know, you
still the best man

43:03.247 --> 43:04.749
that I know in bed.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.711
- What about Willie Green?

43:08.044 --> 43:10.422
- Shit, he ain't sayin' it.

43:10.755 --> 43:11.915
You know, you're the only man

43:12.048 --> 43:14.722
that really blows my mind.

43:15.927 --> 43:19.181
- Did you bail me out of
jail just to tell me this?

43:20.807 --> 43:22.007
- Well, now, I must admit that

43:22.308 --> 43:24.481
that was part of it.

43:25.394 --> 43:28.022
- What was the other part?

43:28.356 --> 43:32.111
- Oh, baby, you know that
I'm still in love with you.

43:33.653 --> 43:35.075
- Pinky?

43:35.404 --> 43:37.077
- Hm?

43:37.406 --> 43:39.454
- Why did you leave Queen Bee

43:39.784 --> 43:42.412
when I was sent to prison?

43:44.455 --> 43:47.755
- Now you know how
lonesome I get without you.

43:48.084 --> 43:50.837
I decided that I should start
doin' somethin' in my life.

43:52.463 --> 43:56.093
- From the looks of things,
you've done pretty well.

43:56.425 --> 43:59.520
- What do you mean by that?

43:59.846 --> 44:01.143
- Whoever bailed me out

44:01.472 --> 44:03.190
had to be stickin' pretty good.

44:05.268 --> 44:06.315
I guess they bailed
me out so they could

44:06.644 --> 44:08.897
take a crack shot at my ass.

44:10.148 --> 44:11.428
- You know, you're such a bitch.

44:11.732 --> 44:13.530
You don't even trust
your own mother.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.107
- Since you wanted my love,

44:16.362 --> 44:18.410
I'm gonna give you a
fuckin' you'll never forget.

44:19.282 --> 44:21.626
 Oh yeah, it's cool

44:21.951 --> 44:24.875
 Sweet, sweet, sweet

44:25.204 --> 44:28.208
 Do you want my lovin'

44:28.541 --> 44:30.964
 Yeah baby

44:32.170 --> 44:34.093
 There's no better

44:34.422 --> 44:35.890
 None better

44:36.215 --> 44:38.468
 Not ever

44:38.801 --> 44:42.647
 Than the love I had
in my heart to give you

44:42.972 --> 44:44.895
 Baby

44:45.224 --> 44:47.727
 You got everything

44:49.270 --> 44:51.443
 Do you really care

44:52.732 --> 44:55.906
 Hey, hey, hey

45:06.829 --> 45:08.502

45:12.251 --> 45:13.423

45:13.753 --> 45:14.800
Yes.

45:15.129 --> 45:17.632
I want you to do
something for me.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.059
I want you to go in my room,

45:20.384 --> 45:23.058
look over my suits,

45:24.263 --> 45:25.731

up on the ceiling

45:26.057 --> 45:28.025
you'll see a key stuck there.

45:28.351 --> 45:31.104
I want you to take it
down and bring it to me.

45:32.188 --> 45:36.284
Meet me at the Total
Experience in one half a hour.

45:37.360 --> 45:39.328
Can you dig it?

45:39.654 --> 45:42.077
Okay, baby, I'll see you later.

45:48.454 --> 45:50.047
- The blond.

45:50.373 --> 45:51.373
She's kinda nice.

45:51.374 --> 45:52.454

45:52.625 --> 45:54.185

45:54.377 --> 45:55.845

46:11.227 --> 46:13.070
The rest of these
bitches can go home.

46:13.396 --> 46:14.556
By the way, what's your name?

46:14.772 --> 46:16.866
It's Chi, short for Chicago.

46:17.191 --> 46:18.943

Would you, uh, mind

46:23.281 --> 46:25.625

46:25.950 --> 46:27.122
I waitin' for someone.

46:27.451 --> 46:29.954

46:36.460 --> 46:37.460

46:37.628 --> 46:38.628
You're hired.

46:38.879 --> 46:40.399

Yeah, shit.

Kinda like that swing.

46:45.594 --> 46:47.392
- Yeah, well, it's alright man.

46:47.722 --> 46:50.225
- Doesn't seem your
friend gonna show up, Chi.

46:51.058 --> 46:52.618
Maybe, um, I may be able
to convince you

46:52.852 --> 46:54.092
that you've been waiting for me

46:54.103 --> 46:55.543
all the time and

46:57.106 --> 46:58.107
By the way, who you

46:58.441 --> 47:00.864
- I'm waitin' for Dolemite.

47:01.193 --> 47:02.911

47:14.999 --> 47:16.376
<i>"Say, man, where you gem"?</i>

47:16.709 --> 47:18.109
Nigga, you don't belong back there.

47:28.846 --> 47:29.893

47:30.222 --> 47:31.314
You don't own this

This is Willie Green place.

47:33.559 --> 47:35.319

47:40.524 --> 47:42.572
You know, I just might call
the police on you, man.

47:42.902 --> 47:43.869
You know, who do you

47:46.030 --> 47:47.122

47:47.448 --> 47:49.075
You just can't come
in here takin' over.

47:49.408 --> 47:52.457
You understand that, Dolemite?

47:54.538 --> 47:56.791
- Give that to Willie Green.

47:57.124 --> 48:01.174
And tell him I want him
out of here in 24 hours.

48:02.296 --> 48:03.798
And <i>23</i> of 'em are already gone.

48:04.131 --> 48:05.131
You understand?

48:39.583 --> 48:41.301
- Dolemite came here, man.

48:41.627 --> 48:43.971
10 men with guns, man.

48:44.296 --> 48:45.296
Just look at it.

48:45.381 --> 48:46.381
Look at the place man.

48:46.674 --> 48:47.675
Yeah.

48:48.008 --> 48:49.008
- 10 men, huh?

48:49.093 --> 48:50.093
- Yeah, see?

48:54.056 --> 48:56.775
- Next time you tell a
lie to me, I'll kill ya.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.398
- But, Boss he...

48:58.727 --> 49:02.027
- Shut up.

49:04.108 --> 49:05.610
And fuck Dolemite!

49:05.943 --> 49:08.241
- Yah! Yah!

49:08.571 --> 49:10.915
- It sure it.

49:11.240 --> 49:12.537
This is where the girls are.

49:13.159 --> 49:14.581
- Now.
- Yah!

49:15.035 --> 49:16.035
- Here's your girls.

49:16.036 --> 49:17.253
What you think about 'em?

49:23.294 --> 49:24.734
- I'll tell you one
thing, Queen Bee.

49:24.962 --> 49:27.886
I wouldn't wanna tangle
with those tigers.

49:28.215 --> 49:30.295
- Well that must mean that
they kind of rough, right?

49:30.551 --> 49:31.591
- They good enough for me.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.261
- This ain't nothin'.

49:32.595 --> 49:33.721
You oughta see 'em when
they really work out.

49:34.054 --> 49:35.727
Chow, chow, chow, you're out!

49:36.056 --> 49:39.651
- They may have to work
out sooner than you think.

49:39.977 --> 49:41.900
- You must be onto
something big.

49:42.229 --> 49:46.200
- Queen Bee, I took the
club back from Willie Green.

49:46.525 --> 49:50.075
And he's mighty
damn sore about it.

49:50.404 --> 49:51.804
- Now how did you
manage to do that?

49:52.072 --> 49:54.040
We owe him $50,000.

49:54.366 --> 49:56.915
- Not anymore.

49:57.244 --> 49:59.042
- Where did you
get the money from?

49:59.371 --> 50:01.044
- Queen Bee,

50:01.373 --> 50:02.716
it's one thing that I learned

50:03.042 --> 50:05.340
when I was around 15 years old,

50:05.669 --> 50:08.969
that if I ever went to prison,
it'd be for something big.

50:10.216 --> 50:12.514
And I promised myself,

50:12.843 --> 50:15.187
that when I got out, I'd
never be broke again.

50:16.263 --> 50:20.063
So I paid Willie Green
every damn cent I owe him.

50:21.268 --> 50:23.191
- Class dismissed.

50:24.355 --> 50:26.449
- Let's go and
talk to the girls.

50:26.774 --> 50:27.900
<i>- ORGY-</i>

50:33.614 --> 50:35.014
Hang on, once I
talk to these girls.

50:35.157 --> 50:36.784
Okay, girls, now turn around.

50:37.117 --> 50:40.041
Dolemite wanna talk to you.

50:44.833 --> 50:46.927
- Girls,

50:47.253 --> 50:48.550
we have our club back.

50:54.718 --> 50:58.018
But there will be problems.

50:58.347 --> 51:00.600
We'll have problems
from the blacks

51:00.933 --> 51:03.482
and the whites.

51:03.811 --> 51:05.688
But from the
demonstration that I saw

51:06.021 --> 51:08.695
out on the floor
a few minutes ago,

51:09.024 --> 51:10.617
I know damn well
we can handle it.

51:10.943 --> 51:12.945
- Right on, yeah.

51:13.279 --> 51:16.123
- Girls, we gonna give one
of the damnedest parties

51:16.448 --> 51:18.166
this city has ever seen.

51:21.495 --> 51:23.247
Queen Bee is going to
send out invitations

51:23.581 --> 51:25.754
to all of our friends
and associates

51:26.083 --> 51:28.177
from all over the country.

51:28.502 --> 51:30.925
And I'm gonna let 'em
know that Dolemite

51:31.255 --> 51:34.099
is back on the scene.

51:34.425 --> 51:37.429
I'm gonna let 'em know
that Dolemite is my name,

51:37.761 --> 51:40.230
and fuckin' up
motherfuckers is my game.

51:45.144 --> 51:47.863
Girls, I want you to go home

51:48.188 --> 51:50.566
and get yourselves together.

51:51.442 --> 51:54.195
And I'll see you at
the club tomorrow.

51:54.528 --> 51:55.528
Can you dig it?

51:59.033 --> 52:00.535
- Okay, girls, see ya tomorrow.

52:00.868 --> 52:01.868
- Okay bye!

52:10.669 --> 52:12.137
- Excuse me, everybody, um,

52:12.463 --> 52:14.932
Miss Edwards would like
to make an announcement.

52:15.257 --> 52:16.975
- Well good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,

52:17.301 --> 52:18.301
and honored guests.

52:18.510 --> 52:19.477
We're very happy to
be here this evening

52:19.803 --> 52:21.396
to honor a very wonderful man.

52:21.722 --> 52:23.975
A man, which we all
love so very much.

52:24.308 --> 52:26.527
This man has done more for
the blacks than anyone.

52:27.186 --> 52:28.438
The man I'm speaking of...

52:38.072 --> 52:39.824
Let's give a warm
round of applause

52:40.157 --> 52:42.000
to Mayor Daley

52:45.079 --> 52:47.252
- Thank you. Thank you.

52:48.999 --> 52:50.592
Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.

52:51.001 --> 52:54.926
Now, I have to tell you that
we owe all of this to you.

52:55.839 --> 52:56.839
And I appreciate it.

52:56.965 --> 52:58.012
It's a wonderful party.

52:58.342 --> 53:01.846
But it's a party and I'm only
going to say a few words.

53:02.763 --> 53:05.983
Now, let me make
this perfectly clear.

53:07.851 --> 53:11.071
No, no, when you go to the
polls again to vote,

53:11.397 --> 53:13.195
and I thank you for electing me,

53:13.524 --> 53:14.524
I want you to know,

53:14.775 --> 53:16.948
these will still be clean.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.804
- Can I help you, young man?

53:44.179 --> 53:47.023
- Yes, sir, I'd like to
see Mayor Daley

53:48.517 --> 53:50.940
- Do you have an
appointment, sir?

53:51.270 --> 53:52.692
- Well not exactly, but um,

53:53.021 --> 53:54.221
if you tell 'em that I'm here,

53:54.481 --> 53:56.529
he'll wanna see me.

53:56.859 --> 53:58.076
Well, I'm sorry.

53:58.402 --> 54:00.575
The mayor doesn't see
uninvited guests in his home.

54:00.904 --> 54:03.953
- No, no, no, look.

54:05.492 --> 54:08.166
You go tell Mayor Daley

54:09.329 --> 54:12.549
that Willie Green is here
from the fourth war.

54:12.875 --> 54:14.969
And he'll see me,
now you get that?

54:15.294 --> 54:16.671
Nigga.

54:17.004 --> 54:19.507
- Yes sir, yes sir.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.513
Right away.

54:38.817 --> 54:40.410
- Just get yourself together.

54:40.736 --> 54:43.239
Take him into the library.

54:45.240 --> 54:46.913
- Darling, something
urgent has come up

54:47.242 --> 54:48.994
Something unexpected.
- Okay.

54:50.120 --> 54:51.997
- Just go ahead and enjoy
yourselves everybody.

54:52.331 --> 54:54.504
I'll be back with you shortly.

54:57.628 --> 55:00.928
Don't you know better
than to come to my home?

55:01.256 --> 55:04.806
I transact business
in my office.

55:05.135 --> 55:06.637
Now, what do you want?

55:06.970 --> 55:10.725
- This is something that
can't wait for no damn office.

55:11.058 --> 55:12.810
There's trouble at
the fourth ward.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.816
- Trouble, what kind of trouble?

55:15.103 --> 55:18.357
- Something that I'm not
gonna take the burnt end for.

55:18.690 --> 55:20.818
- Well, all right, spill it.

55:21.151 --> 55:22.027
- Dolemite just got out of jail

55:22.361 --> 55:24.784
and he's causing
problems in my club.

55:25.113 --> 55:26.410
Now you know Dolemite.

55:26.740 --> 55:27.780
Once he gets on your back,

55:27.866 --> 55:30.210
it's hard to get him off.

55:30.536 --> 55:31.958
- NOW Willie.

55:32.287 --> 55:34.255
You don't have to
worry about him.

55:34.581 --> 55:37.676
I know he's back.

55:38.001 --> 55:40.880
In fact, I had him bailed out.

55:41.213 --> 55:42.635
So I can hit him,

55:42.965 --> 55:45.184
whenever we're ready.

55:45.509 --> 55:47.887
Just get on back to the club.

55:48.220 --> 55:49.220
You just

55:49.304 --> 55:51.272
keep the blacks together.

55:51.598 --> 55:52.598
You just

55:52.808 --> 55:53.855
keep things movin.

55:54.184 --> 55:56.027
You know what I mean.

55:57.271 --> 55:58.318
- You got it.

55:58.647 --> 56:01.241
- I'll take care
of the Dolemite.

56:17.082 --> 56:18.675
Mitchell,

56:20.168 --> 56:21.761
Sheriff listen.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.975
Take care, alright?

56:26.884 --> 56:29.182
Keep my name clean.

56:42.274 --> 56:43.901
And Mitchell

56:44.234 --> 56:47.784
Listen, I don't
like Willie Green.

56:48.113 --> 56:51.617
I don't want him
coming here anymore.

57:04.338 --> 57:05.885
- Good afternoon,

57:06.214 --> 57:08.967
Dolemite's Total Experience.

57:09.301 --> 57:10.301
No he's not here.

57:10.385 --> 57:12.105
Wait just a minute, I
think I hear him, oh-.

57:12.179 --> 57:15.809
Dolemite, telephone for you.

57:16.141 --> 57:18.860
- Dolemite here.

57:20.854 --> 57:22.356
Yes Reverend.

57:25.192 --> 57:27.911
What kind of tip
do you have for me?

57:28.236 --> 57:30.989
$500!

57:31.323 --> 57:33.371
Oh hell no, Reverend,
I'll give you two.

57:35.410 --> 57:37.663
Meet you in 20 minutes?

57:37.996 --> 57:39.998
Reverend, I can't be
there in 20 minutes.

57:40.290 --> 57:41.290
Make it an hour.

57:41.583 --> 57:43.802
Thanks, okay.

58:00.310 --> 58:02.483
Goddamn, mama, this
sure is a spooky joint.

58:02.813 --> 58:04.406
- Yeah, want me to wait outside.

58:04.731 --> 58:06.358
- Hell no, not this time, mama.

58:06.692 --> 58:08.069
I want you right by my side.

58:08.402 --> 58:09.870
- I'm afraid of ghosts.

58:10.195 --> 58:11.117
- Ghosts, if you
ever see a ghost,

58:11.446 --> 58:13.699
cut the motherfucker.

58:14.908 --> 58:16.285
- Good afternoon.

58:16.618 --> 58:18.666
- What the hell is good
about scaring the hell

58:18.996 --> 58:19.996
out of my woman here?

58:20.247 --> 58:20.873
- You got the money?

58:21.206 --> 58:23.300
- Give him the money baby.

58:27.504 --> 58:29.177
How's business, Reverend?

58:29.506 --> 58:31.133
- It could be better.

58:31.466 --> 58:33.639
- What you got for me man?

58:33.969 --> 58:35.346
- I know who set you up

58:35.679 --> 58:37.352
and had you sent to prison.

58:37.681 --> 58:41.060
I also know who's
behind Willie Green.

58:41.393 --> 58:42.986
Here.

58:43.311 --> 58:44.551
Take this address on the docks.

58:44.813 --> 58:46.611
Go there tomorrow morning.

58:46.940 --> 58:49.409
You might find it
very interesting.

58:49.735 --> 58:52.204
If you get a chance
to check out the fish.

58:52.529 --> 58:54.907
- Man, how am I going
out on that dock

58:55.240 --> 58:58.084
snooping around without
somebody knowin' about it?

58:58.410 --> 59:01.004
- Dolomite, you're no square.

59:01.329 --> 59:03.752
You're seeking employment.

59:04.082 --> 59:06.460
The man who does the
hiring is the connection

59:06.793 --> 59:10.013
to the main line.

59:10.338 --> 59:12.636
- Look like you got a
full house here, Rev.

59:12.966 --> 59:14.468
Know any of these guys?

59:14.801 --> 59:17.680
- Very well.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.684
- Mmm.

59:22.809 --> 59:25.153
Two dead ones and one live.

59:25.437 --> 59:27.565
- Are you satisfied now?

59:27.898 --> 59:29.098
- Gimme me back my money, man.

59:29.232 --> 59:30.609
- Now why should I do that?

59:30.942 --> 59:33.036
- Just say I open my
mouth and tell the police

59:33.361 --> 59:37.867
about all the guns and all the
shit you got going on here.

59:39.284 --> 59:42.208
- Then we'd have to
close it for you.

59:42.537 --> 59:43.537
- Come on.

59:43.747 --> 59:45.545
That's what I said
about you Reverend.

59:45.874 --> 59:47.376
We asked you a
sensible question,

59:47.709 --> 59:50.303
you come out with
a sensible answer.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.631
Let's go baby.

59:52.964 --> 59:54.762
Oh, by the way, Reverend.

59:55.092 --> 59:57.094
Why you giving me all
this information anyway?

59:57.427 --> 01:00:01.352
- Oh, just say it's
for the Lord, brother.

01:00:01.681 --> 01:00:05.026
Besides, I don't like the MFs.

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:09.781
If you run into any
trouble, just give the word.

01:00:11.233 --> 01:00:12.780
The big man sent me.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:14.737
- Good answer, Reverend.

01:00:15.070 --> 01:00:16.070
Later.

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:51.653
Cocaine, just what I expected.

01:00:59.948 --> 01:01:01.120
Jenny Linch and Mary Love,

01:01:01.449 --> 01:01:02.729
I want to thank
y'all so much for

01:01:02.951 --> 01:01:04.231
coming out to be
with me tonight.

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:05.499
- Dolemite brother,

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.502
we wouldn't have missed
it for the world.

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:10.814
 You know you gotta
stop your crying

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.924
 Sometimes it's up to
you to clear your ways

01:01:13.253 --> 01:01:15.051
 It's up to you to
make your sunshine

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.223
 You know I love rainy days

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:19.096
 Without my love,
without the love

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:21.303
 We'd be nowhere at all

01:01:21.636 --> 01:01:22.636
 Without the love

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:25.057
 The love, we'd still not know
the sky would fall.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.355
 It's time all the time

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.394
 It's time all the time

01:01:29.728 --> 01:01:31.947
 It's time all the time, whoo!

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:33.819
 Is it really all the time

01:01:34.149 --> 01:01:35.901
 So come on girl and understand

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:38.236
 You know it's time for us to see

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.995
 The time is now to face the girl
like it's time to face reality

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:44.292
 So take my hand and understand

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.165
 Why nothing
could drive me away

01:01:46.494 --> 01:01:48.713
 Communicating that I'm
in love love with you

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.586
 Has put me in a heavenly way

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:52.299
 It's time all the time

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.761
 It's time all the time

01:01:55.128 --> 01:01:56.971
 It's time all the time, whoo

01:01:57.297 --> 01:02:00.050

01:02:19.986 --> 01:02:22.409
 Baby all the time!

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:26.038
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:29.087
Tonight, I know that
you're ready for a show.

01:02:29.412 --> 01:02:30.629
Thank you so much.

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.208
Tonight means a whole lot to me

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.962
Tonight is Dolemite's night.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:35.614
However, I'd like to acknowledge

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:37.049
some of the friends that,

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:38.819
thought very much
of us to come down.

01:02:39.005 --> 01:02:40.507
Mr. O'Neal from the show ball.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:42.388
Cleveland, Ohio.

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:45.095
Billy Butler, Cleveland, Ohio.

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:47.772
Mr. Sam Houston, as of
this day, our local town.

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:49.538
So now I know you
ready for the show.

01:02:50.183 --> 01:02:51.730
Let's hoop it up for

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.312
Mary Love!

01:03:19.879 --> 01:03:22.302
 When we start

01:03:24.592 --> 01:03:28.062
 Making love

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:30.641
 The kind of love

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:47.077
Doli, we got trouble.

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:52.583
- What kind of
trouble, Queen Bee?

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.255
- The worst kind.

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:56.959
Willie Green's out
there with his party.

01:03:57.292 --> 01:04:00.045
- Is Chi in the club?

01:04:00.378 --> 01:04:01.971
- Yeah, she's workin' the floor.

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:06.052
- Then I want you to
take care of things.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:07.852
Keep your eyes and ears open,

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:09.179
you understand?

01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:13.434
<i>- ORGY-</i>

01:04:13.767 --> 01:04:15.735
But I'm still worried.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:19.656
 Let's take a chance with

01:04:20.065 --> 01:04:23.239
 Going to find romance

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:29.996
 When we start

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:38.337
 When we start, when we start

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:43.297
 When we start, when
we start, hey, hey, hey, start

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.386
And now ladies and gentlemen,

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:58.441
the moment that you've
been waiting for,

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.613
the one man who has brought you

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:02.486
to Eat Out More Often and this Pussy
Belong to me.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:05.285
But first to bring it
in time and in tune,

01:05:05.610 --> 01:05:08.284
we are going to bring
you the Dolemite Dancers.

01:05:08.613 --> 01:05:10.456
How 'bout it?

01:07:27.835 --> 01:07:30.964
- Way down in the jungle deep,

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:36.428
the lion stepped on the
signified monkey's feet.

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:43.026
The monkey said,
"Motherfucker, can't you see?"

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.691
"You're standing on
my goddamn feet?"

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:54.908
The monkey lived in a
jungle in an old oak tree,

01:07:57.532 --> 01:08:00.536
bullshittin' a lion
every day of the week.

01:08:02.078 --> 01:08:03.751
Every day before
the sun go down,

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:06.583
that lion would kick his ass
all through the jungle town.

01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:12.506
But the monkey got wise
and started using his wit,

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:16.399
start sayin' I'm gonna
put a stop to this

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.678
whole ass kickin' shit.

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:22.185
So he ran up on the
lion the very next day.

01:08:24.058 --> 01:08:26.152
He said, "Oh, Mr. Lion",

01:08:26.477 --> 01:08:30.152
"there's a big bad
motherfucker comin' your way."

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:34.361
"And he's someone
that you don't know,"

01:08:34.694 --> 01:08:38.038
"he just broke-a loose from
Ringling Brothers' show."

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:42.870
"Said he talked about your
people in a hell of a way."

01:08:43.202 --> 01:08:45.796
"He talked about your people
'til my hair turned gray."

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.836
"But Mr. Lion, you
know that ain't right."

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:52.886
"So whenever you run
up on the elephant"

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.761
"I want you to be ready to fight."

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:58.889
The lion jumped up
in a hell of a rage.

01:08:59.218 --> 01:09:02.518
Like a young man
smokin' some gauge.

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:05.475
He ran up to the
elephant, talking with a smile.

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.357
He said, "All right, you
big bad motherfucker."

01:09:08.685 --> 01:09:11.314
"It's gonna be
your ass or mine."

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:14.276
The lion jumped up
and made a fancy pass.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:15.906
But the elephant
side stepped him

01:09:16.234 --> 01:09:18.658
and knocked him dead on his ass.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:21.912
He fucked up his jaw,
mess up his feet,

01:09:22.241 --> 01:09:25.620
broke all four legs, and
knocked his ass outta place.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:31.716
They fought all night
and all the next clay.

01:09:32.042 --> 01:09:35.046
Somehow the little lion
managed to get away.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:39.384
He drug his ass back to the
jungle more dead than alive,

01:09:39.716 --> 01:09:41.139
just to run into
that little monkey

01:09:41.469 --> 01:09:43.767
and some more of his signifying jive.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:46.064
The monkey said,
"Look here, partner,"

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.143
"You don't look so swell."

01:09:48.475 --> 01:09:50.694
"Look like to me you
caught a whole lotta hell."

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:54.824
Says, "your eyes is red
and your ass is blue",

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:58.949
said, "that I knew in the first
place it wasn't shit to you."

01:09:59.278 --> 01:10:00.825
"But I told my wife
before you left"

01:10:01.155 --> 01:10:04.785
"I shoulda whooped your
ass my motherfuckin' self."

01:10:11.249 --> 01:10:12.249
"Shut up."

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.877
"Don't you roar 'cause
I'll jump outta this tree"

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:17.089
"and whoop your
dog ass some more."

01:10:17.422 --> 01:10:19.925
"And don't look up here
with your sucker paw case,"

01:10:20.258 --> 01:10:22.226
“cause I'll piss through
the bark of this tree

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:25.476
"in your motherfuckin' face."

01:10:25.805 --> 01:10:28.854
Little monkey got happy and
started jumpin' up in his dawn.

01:10:29.183 --> 01:10:32.312
His feet missed the limb,
his ass hit the ground.

01:10:32.645 --> 01:10:35.398
Like a ball of lightning
and a streak of white heat,

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:38.326
that lion was on his
ass with all four feet.

01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:41.905
Dust rose and tears came in
the little monkey's eyes.

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:45.242
Nothin' he could see and
nothin' he could hear,

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:48.203
but he knew that was
the end of his bullshit

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:51.756
and signified career.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.709
And signified career.

01:11:02.967 --> 01:11:07.017
- Alright, let's hear it!

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.688
Come back tomorrow
night, same time,

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:13.152
at Dolemite's Total Experience.

01:11:13.478 --> 01:11:14.478
Thank you.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.584
- Now here's an
expensive message.

01:11:35.124 --> 01:11:37.877
And here's my tip.

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:45.226
- Hand me my shirt Chi.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:49.055
I want you to go
back out in the club

01:11:49.388 --> 01:11:50.731
as soon as I get dressed.

01:11:51.057 --> 01:11:52.183
I'll be right out.

01:11:52.725 --> 01:11:54.272
Can you dig it?

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:56.070
- Sure.

01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:05.829
- You want to see me man?

01:12:06.155 --> 01:12:07.998
- Aha, brother Dolemite.

01:12:09.951 --> 01:12:12.875
Sit down, join the party.

01:12:16.958 --> 01:12:20.132
Hey, this is the man
who owns the club.

01:12:20.461 --> 01:12:22.259
Now, yeah.

01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:24.261
Hey, what kind of
drink you want man?

01:12:24.590 --> 01:12:27.013
- I don't think I care
to drink with you man.

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.892
- I wanna make a deal with you.

01:12:30.221 --> 01:12:31.973
- What kind of deal?

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:34.650
- You cheated me.

01:12:34.976 --> 01:12:38.981
You paid me a lousy $50,000.

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:41.236
- That's right, now
what's your problem?

01:12:41.566 --> 01:12:45.491
- There's no problem,
it's just interest.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:48.869
$100,000.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.246
Come on, don't get excited.

01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:54.170
Listen, uh,

01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:55.735
why don't we make another deal?

01:12:56.664 --> 01:12:59.463
Uh, you and me, partners.

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:01.551
Okay?

01:13:01.919 --> 01:13:03.387
Uh, I saw your act,

01:13:03.713 --> 01:13:04.713
you're pretty damn good.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:07.220
You know your business.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.143
You take care of the business,

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.554
I take care of the heat.

01:13:12.763 --> 01:13:16.438
You can keep your
stingy $100,000.

01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:20.154
- It's nice to have
seen you people.

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:23.323
But fuck you man.

01:13:28.696 --> 01:13:30.414
- Gimme me the gun.

01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.367
- What do you want the gun for?

01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:34.828
- Gimme the gun!

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:36.708
- Here's the gun.

01:13:37.038 --> 01:13:38.585
- I'm gonna kill Dolemite.

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:39.915
I don't want no sweat.

01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:42.043
Let's turn the place out!

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.315
You the cook ain't you?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:19.773
- Dirty black bitch,
I'm gonna kill you.

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:26.155
Get this, bitch off of me

01:16:09.356 --> 01:16:10.528
- Watch out.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:35.095
- Goddamn, Dolemite.

01:16:38.803 --> 01:16:41.397
Now it's off of you, it's on me.

01:16:41.806 --> 01:16:42.853
You're hurt pretty bad.

01:16:43.182 --> 01:16:43.899
We better get you
to the hospital.

01:16:44.225 --> 01:16:45.505
- There's a back
way out the end.

01:16:45.768 --> 01:16:48.146
- Okay, we're gonna take off.

01:16:56.237 --> 01:16:57.717
- What the fuck do
you want, Mitchell?

01:16:57.988 --> 01:16:59.581
- Yes, sir, I'm tellin'
sir, all hell broke loose

01:16:59.907 --> 01:17:01.027
out here in the fourth ward.

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:04.249
Willie Green is dead,
a couple of his boys.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:06.205
- Oh, hold on.

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:08.462
- Looks like Dolemite
did it, yes sir.

01:17:08.791 --> 01:17:09.791
- Wait a minute.

01:17:10.042 --> 01:17:12.010
Let me up.

01:17:13.921 --> 01:17:14.968
<i>Damn“.</i>

01:17:15.297 --> 01:17:16.423
Shit.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.144
Shit.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:25.890
Now where's the Dolemite?

01:17:25.933 --> 01:17:27.401
Did you get him?

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:29.694
- No, sir, he's disappeared.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:32.022
- You find him quick.

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:33.949
And kill him before he blows it.

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:36.994
And Mitchell, don't
you call me unless,

01:17:37.319 --> 01:17:40.118
unless he's dead,
you hear me dead.

01:17:40.447 --> 01:17:42.415
- Yes, sir.

01:17:48.330 --> 01:17:51.459
- Eddie. Listen to me.

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:54.511
Now listen I don't
have much time.

01:17:54.837 --> 01:17:56.680
I want you to put out a hunt,

01:17:57.006 --> 01:17:58.726
and you find that
Dolemite and you hold him.

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:01.180
And when you get him, what?

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.558
- Good boy, Eddie.

01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:08.188
Thank you, yeah.

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:09.517
No, no, no.

01:18:09.727 --> 01:18:10.727
No everything's fine now.

01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:13.030
Bye.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.488
Now listen.

01:18:17.818 --> 01:18:19.991
This is big man.

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:22.949
I want a contract
on the Dolemite.

01:18:24.116 --> 01:18:26.710
He's at Morningside Hospital.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:28.913
<i>Room 2218.</i>

01:18:29.246 --> 01:18:31.840
Hit him.

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:43.140
Now what's this all about?

01:18:43.469 --> 01:18:44.937
- It means, goddamn it,

01:18:45.262 --> 01:18:46.889
I been waitin' for
your ass a long time.

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:50.443
Now sit down motherfucker.

01:18:50.768 --> 01:18:51.644
- What are you doing with that?

01:18:51.977 --> 01:18:53.820
- I said sit down.

01:18:54.146 --> 01:18:55.146
- What are you doin'?

01:18:55.356 --> 01:18:55.948
Now, look, I've
been good to you.

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:57.273
- Oh really?

01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:58.943
Good treatment? You have
used me for long enough.

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:00.368
Sit down.

01:19:00.694 --> 01:19:02.494
And I mean you have
killed a lot of my people.

01:19:02.655 --> 01:19:03.872
Just shut up!

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:05.198
- Where's my wife?

01:19:05.491 --> 01:19:07.744
- Stupid bitch is in there
sleepin' like a baby.

01:19:08.077 --> 01:19:09.077
You know what, honey?

01:19:09.370 --> 01:19:11.130
This is gonna give me
a whole lot of pleasure

01:19:11.205 --> 01:19:14.459
sending you straight to
hell on this toilet seat.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:16.590
- Careful with that.

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:18.679
Alright, I'll give you
everything you want...

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.889
- Old man, it's
too late for that.

01:19:21.215 --> 01:19:23.809
- Please, please, don't kill me!

01:19:28.013 --> 01:19:29.515
You crazy bitch!

01:19:59.878 --> 01:20:01.130
- Welcome, Blakley.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:02.885
We were expecting you.

01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:04.216
- Okay, Mr. FBI man,

01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:07.178
we're gonna put an end
to your spying around.

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:09.855
- Pull up his sleeve.

01:20:10.180 --> 01:20:11.932
- Hey, what are
you guys gonna do?

01:20:12.266 --> 01:20:13.266
- We're gonna turn you on

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:15.694
and then you're gonna
go in the pool and swim.

01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.022
- I can't swim.

01:20:19.064 --> 01:20:20.566
- Got it all ready now.

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:22.116
Enough to kill 10 cows.

01:20:22.443 --> 01:20:23.865
- Block your arm.

01:20:24.194 --> 01:20:25.741
- So I'm supposed to be
found ODed in that pool.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.243
- That's right.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:28.574
- Hey, you guys are
gettin' away with murder.

01:20:29.074 --> 01:20:30.200
Look, your boss is getting
away with the loot.

01:20:30.784 --> 01:20:32.144
- What the hell you talkin' about?

01:20:32.202 --> 01:20:33.203
- Look behind you.

01:20:33.537 --> 01:20:34.914
Your boss is getting away.

01:22:52.843 --> 01:22:55.062
- And to add another burden
to your problem, Dolemite,

01:22:55.387 --> 01:22:56.809
there's a contract on you.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.392
- Oh no, honey.

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:01.602
- I guess you come
here to fill it.

01:23:01.935 --> 01:23:04.734
- Matter of fact, I came
here to try and stop it.

01:23:05.981 --> 01:23:07.779
- Well, I'll be damned.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:09.388
You know, I thought you was just

01:23:09.443 --> 01:23:12.868
another one of them
jive ass rooty tootie cops.

01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:14.073
- You know you
started a lot of shit

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:15.658
in this town, Dolemite.

01:23:15.991 --> 01:23:18.289
But I think I know who
put the contract on you.

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:21.793
Tonight we're gonna
try and solve it.

01:23:22.122 --> 01:23:23.624
- What am I to do man?

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:27.211
Lay up here and let 'em take
a crack shot at my black ass?

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:28.887
- Not exactly.

01:23:29.213 --> 01:23:30.886
I got a master plan going.

01:23:31.215 --> 01:23:33.934
I'll talk to the

01:23:34.259 --> 01:23:36.478
head of the hospital.

01:23:36.803 --> 01:23:38.976
And we decided to
change the number

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:40.808
on your room downstairs.

01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:42.984
Now I need your and Chi's help.

01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:44.983
Here's what I want you to do.

01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:46.362
- Dr. Sullivan.

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:48.486
Calling Dr. Sullivan.

01:23:48.815 --> 01:23:51.944
You're wanted in
the emergency room.

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:54.245
Dr. Feelgood,

01:23:54.571 --> 01:23:56.073
calling Dr. Feelgood

01:23:56.406 --> 01:23:59.205
you're wanted in
inhalation therapy.

01:24:01.328 --> 01:24:02.955
- May I help you, sir?

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:05.882
- Yes, I'm Mr. Burns.

01:24:06.208 --> 01:24:08.882
These are my associates.

01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:12.090
There's a friend
of mine, Dolemite?

01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:14.720
In room 2218?

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:16.597
I'd like to check on him.

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:19.225
- Oh yes, Mr. Burns,
but if I'm not mistaken,

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:21.273
the room is 2210.

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:25.353
- Oh.

01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:51.674
Son of a bitch.

01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:48.227
- Just in time, man, thanks, baby.

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:01.907
- Are you alright?

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.993
- Yeah, man, I feel fine.

01:26:07.537 --> 01:26:09.505
Tell Blakely I'm alright.

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:11.378
- There's more to come.

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:13.881
Sit tight, I'll be around.

01:26:18.048 --> 01:26:19.846
- Freeze punk, or
I'll blow your brains

01:26:20.175 --> 01:26:21.927
all over the wallpaper.

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.853
- Alright, afro, on your feet.

01:26:24.888 --> 01:26:26.048
Place that hand on your head.

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:27.223
You're comin' with us.

01:26:27.391 --> 01:26:30.019
- You rat-soup-eatin'
honkey motherfucker!

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:33.688
- Drop it, Mitchell.

01:26:33.897 --> 01:26:34.898
You too, White.

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:36.654
- What the hell's
the matter with you, Blakely?

01:26:36.983 --> 01:26:37.404
- Are you all crazy?

01:26:37.734 --> 01:26:38.109
This man's a murderer.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:38.864
I gotta take him in.

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:40.320
- I'll take him in

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.406
along with the both of you.

01:26:42.739 --> 01:26:43.991
I'm onto your game, Mitchell.

01:26:44.324 --> 01:26:45.997
It's all over.

01:26:46.326 --> 01:26:48.078
I work for the FBI.

01:26:48.412 --> 01:26:50.710
And I'm gonna see that
the both of you do time.

01:26:51.039 --> 01:26:53.212
Take 'em out of here officer.

01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:58.297
- You know the routine.

01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:04.928
- You better think about
what you're doin' man.

01:27:06.012 --> 01:27:09.607
- Turn around.

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:14.445
- I should have never
listened to you, Mitchell.

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:16.011
Look at the mess you got us in.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:17.231
- Oh shut up.

01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:18.909
Ain't nobody made
you do nothin'.

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:20.360
- You're the smart guy
with all the brains.

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:23.197
- Use your head, punk, huh?

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:24.702
- Shit.

01:27:25.031 --> 01:27:28.535
- I'm not your goddamn daddy.

01:27:28.869 --> 01:27:29.869
- Hey listen.

01:27:29.995 --> 01:27:32.089
<i>- ORGY-</i>

01:27:44.801 --> 01:27:46.401
- Sorry we had to
close you up, Dolemite,

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.973
but I guess you
can understand why.

01:27:49.306 --> 01:27:50.979
But you're a free man.

01:27:51.308 --> 01:27:52.400
What are you gonna do

01:27:52.726 --> 01:27:53.978
and where you gonna go
from here, Dolemite?

01:27:54.311 --> 01:27:56.814
 I'm goin' back
to the black land

01:27:57.522 --> 01:27:59.945
 With all of my poor friends

01:28:01.568 --> 01:28:04.993
 'Cause it may come a time
I might need them again

01:28:06.323 --> 01:28:09.793
 Sometimes you climb high
on a hill and this is a fact

01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:13.038
 Those dreams get wasted

01:28:13.371 --> 01:28:17.467
 And your black ass slide back

01:28:17.793 --> 01:28:19.073
 We gonna put
the P in the party

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:21.634
 And let the good times roll

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:24.091
 There'll be
drinkin' and smokin'

01:28:24.424 --> 01:28:27.098
 Satisfy your soul

01:28:28.428 --> 01:28:31.728
 Stop into my house
anytime and have pot luck.

01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:36.023
 Don't care what your name
is and what you're wearin'

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:38.947
 We don't even give a fuck

01:28:39.272 --> 01:28:42.651
 Yes, I'm gonna tell
my children's children

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:47.034
 What life is all about

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:48.364
 And hopin'

01:28:49.282 --> 01:28:52.252
 They have just enough soul

01:28:52.577 --> 01:28:54.375
 To figure it out.

01:28:54.704 --> 01:28:57.708
 You know water will
cool and fire will burn

01:28:59.042 --> 01:29:03.138
 And just as sure as
my name is Dolemite

01:29:03.463 --> 01:29:07.184
 I shall return
