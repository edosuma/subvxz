00:00.167 --> 00:02.044
<i>Previously on</i>
Party Of Five.. <i>.</i>

00:02.044 --> 00:03.212
Congratulations,
you're hired.

00:03.212 --> 00:04.880
I need a photocopy of
your driver's license

00:04.880 --> 00:06.298
and we'll get
the paperwork started.

00:06.298 --> 00:07.549
I don't have I. D.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.886
My list of problems goes
where's my next
meal coming from.

00:10.886 --> 00:12.596
Are my parents gonna
come after me.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.640
And then all the way
down at the bottom,

00:14.640 --> 00:16.850
what does the government say
about my citizenship status.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.727
Maybe that's something
we can fix.

00:18.727 --> 00:21.813
Excuse me. I have
something for him.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.899
Matthew:
<i>It'll be years before</i>
<i>that little baby</i>

00:23.899 --> 00:25.651
needs a social security number.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.860
I need one now.

00:27.069 --> 00:30.322
A shot of your cheapest tequila,
please, Beto.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.783
‐How do you know my name?
‐I'm Ella.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.576
‐Who are you?
<i>‐Who are you?</i>

00:34.576 --> 00:37.079
‐I'm trying to call my mom.
<i>‐You mean Glo?</i>

00:40.499 --> 00:41.667
Ella?

00:41.667 --> 00:43.502
I wanna see you
fire him.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.796
He's just a kid.
He made a mistake.

00:45.796 --> 00:48.465
You're gonna make sure
he learns his lesson

00:48.465 --> 00:50.842
before you drop him back
on whatever street corner
you found him.

00:51.635 --> 00:52.803
That's my brother.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.805
And as long as I'm around,

00:54.805 --> 00:57.557
no one is gonna
ever talk to him like that.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.059
(car horn honks)

01:00.185 --> 01:01.603
Where we goin'?

01:01.603 --> 01:02.813
Wherever you like.

01:06.525 --> 01:08.652
‐Beto: Do you need to go?
‐Ella: Not yet.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.529
Your dad doesn't know
you're staying here, right?

01:11.113 --> 01:12.948
No. I just told him I'm
staying at Phoebe's place.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.243
Her mom, Lina,
is a great cook.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.704
Who's always trying to get
me to eat because she thinks
I'm too skinny.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.665
And Glenn, her dad.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.375
He's the one who
turned me on to Led Zeppelin.

01:24.167 --> 01:25.669
‐Phoebe.
‐Mm‐hmm.

01:25.669 --> 01:26.920
Why haven't I met her?

01:27.296 --> 01:29.756
Because she moved to
Michigan when I was 13.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.426
And your dad has no idea?

01:33.885 --> 01:35.971
As long as he thinks
some adult is vaguely aware

01:35.971 --> 01:38.432
of my comings and goings,
he's fine.

01:38.432 --> 01:42.394
He gets to, you know,
check the boxes of being
a responsible parent.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.816
Which I guess is nothing
compared to your situation.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.234
No. Just...

01:50.193 --> 01:51.028
Different.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.656
Like, is it worse to have
good parents far away?

01:54.656 --> 01:56.658
Or bad parents who
were never really there?

01:57.242 --> 01:58.076
Yeah.

02:00.162 --> 02:01.997
At least it means I get
to spend more time with you.

Let me make it clear.

02:46.708 --> 02:47.918
Anything you wanna do...

02:49.002 --> 02:50.003

Hey! Hey, I got dinner.

03:19.825 --> 03:22.869
I was thinking maybe
we could sit down

03:22.869 --> 03:24.246
and have a meal
together for once.

03:24.246 --> 03:25.080
Hmm?

03:25.455 --> 03:26.748
Do you have a charger
I can borrow?

03:26.748 --> 03:28.875
I can't find mine
and this thing's about to die.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.710
Then let it die. Okay?

03:31.128 --> 03:32.796
Set yourself free.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.090
‐You're hilarious.
‐Seriously.

03:35.674 --> 03:36.842
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

03:37.592 --> 03:39.386
Why don't you ask
a friend over, huh?

03:39.803 --> 03:40.929
Have a sleepover?

03:40.929 --> 03:42.722
Oh! What about that girl?

03:42.722 --> 03:45.767
Uh, what's the name of
the one who used to be big
into hopscotch with you?

03:45.767 --> 03:46.768
Cassie.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.020
She got boobs.
It went to her head.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.816
Right. Um... Okay.
Well then, uh...

03:53.400 --> 03:54.484
What about, uh...

03:55.277 --> 03:56.778
Ooh. What about, um...

03:56.778 --> 03:59.573
Don't we have enough people
sleeping in this house?

04:05.662 --> 04:07.497
I went to the Y.
I mean, trust me.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.249
They have some great
after‐school activities.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.961
I mean, soccer. Painting.
Swimming?

04:13.587 --> 04:15.130
Come on, Val.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.090
We gotta get you out
into the world, okay?

04:17.090 --> 04:18.967
Spending time with kids
your own age.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.969
Away from that stupid phone.

04:23.096 --> 04:24.556
Okay. Fine.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.058
We can talk about it
at dinner.

04:27.058 --> 04:27.976
I'm gonna check on Rafa.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.936
Oh, uh, he went down early.

04:30.729 --> 04:31.563
No kidding.

04:31.938 --> 04:33.356
Sleeping like a champ, huh?

04:34.149 --> 04:36.443
I'm telling you, Ferberizing
is the way to go.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.069
Let 'em cry it out.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.572
Yeah, gotta show a baby
who's boss, you know.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.282
I mean it, Val.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.493
Look 'em over
and let me know. Okay?

04:47.913 --> 04:48.747
(knocking)

04:49.164 --> 04:51.124
Dinner in five. You good?

04:51.750 --> 04:56.922
Just gimme one second
and... done.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.715
Will you give that to
Rodrigo in the morning?

04:58.715 --> 05:01.176
(printer whirring)

05:03.804 --> 05:06.181
‐What is it?
‐A letter to his landlord.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.017
They're not gonna evict him now.
Not unless they wanna get sued.

05:09.851 --> 05:12.521
You sure you're okay
with me passing these
help requests to you?

05:12.521 --> 05:13.688
Are you kidding me?

05:14.523 --> 05:16.858
I would blow off school
entirely for this

05:16.858 --> 05:18.652
if I could get away with it.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.570
So many people need advocates.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.656
You knew I'd be good at this.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.491
Thanks.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.369
Yeah, yeah.
All right, go wash up.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.246
(Emilio whistles)

05:31.373 --> 05:33.959
It's a value pack.
In case you run out.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.127
Thanks but, uh, I think
I'm good.

05:36.545 --> 05:38.296
First girlfriend, Bey.
You go through a lot.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.966
Believe me. A lot.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.845
Okay, well, Ella and I
haven't exactly gotten
started yet.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.346
But I'm sure when we do...

05:49.307 --> 05:51.643
Seriously? You haven't
done it yet?

05:53.311 --> 05:54.729
Oh. Uh...

05:55.897 --> 05:57.274
Okay. Um...

05:57.816 --> 05:58.650
(clears throat)

05:59.985 --> 06:02.445
Well, there comes a time
in every man's life‐‐

06:02.445 --> 06:04.489
Oh God, no, please, Emilio.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.242
Oh. <i>Papi</i> gave me a speech.
I just thought...

06:08.118 --> 06:08.994
Sit.

06:09.953 --> 06:11.204
(exhales)

06:14.541 --> 06:16.710
To be honest, those weren't
<i>Papi's</i> best speeches.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.547
I'd already been having sex
for about two years before
he sat me down.

06:21.339 --> 06:22.966
‐Wait, what?
‐Mm‐hmm.

06:22.966 --> 06:23.925
How old were you
when you...

06:25.719 --> 06:28.138
Never mind.
I don't wanna know.

06:29.472 --> 06:31.141
"Treat women with respect!"

06:32.100 --> 06:33.268
(laughs)
That was the headline.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.186
Don't get yourself in trouble.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.063
That's what he said.

06:39.149 --> 06:40.650
But here's what you really
need to know.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.446
Forget everything you learned
from porn. Okay?

06:45.113 --> 06:47.115
Don't rush. Take it slow.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.576
You know. Show her you know
what you're doin'.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.786
Well, that's gonna be
a problem.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.789
It's not her first time.
She's gonna know
if I suck at it.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.707
Don't worry. You will.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.586
Just make sure she's good.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.630
You know what I mean?

07:03.465 --> 07:04.299
Good.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.016
(exhales)
Oh, and, uh...

07:13.767 --> 07:15.810
Keep it here at home. Okay?

07:16.811 --> 07:19.189
Don't want you staring down
the barrel of Ella's
dad's shotgun.

07:20.649 --> 07:24.319
What's worse?
That or getting walked in on
by your little sister.

07:24.319 --> 07:27.614
(laughs)
We'll get you a lock.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.159
Comin', Luce?
It's gonna get cold.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.829
If you're still on your phone,
Val, and the table isn't set...

07:35.705 --> 07:37.165
And come on, please.

07:37.165 --> 07:38.958
Can we turn off some
of these lights, guys?

07:38.958 --> 07:39.959
I'm not made of money.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.004
Beto:
You sound like dad!

07:45.840 --> 07:48.301
♪♪

08:13.660 --> 08:15.245
Vanessa. Really?

08:16.204 --> 08:18.498
Emilio didn't say a word.

08:18.498 --> 08:21.543
Yeah, well, he's bummed.
We all are.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.294
It's been a while
since we liked
one of his girlfriends.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.547
Beto especially, huh?

08:25.547 --> 08:27.841
I kinda noticed.
He seems distracted.

08:28.299 --> 08:30.135
Oh no, that's not
about Vanessa.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.262
Beto's got himself
a girlfriend.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.598
Mm‐hmm. He's thinking
about sex 24/7.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.475
(laughs)
So...

08:38.268 --> 08:40.311
Lots of people
coming and going, huh?

08:41.020 --> 08:43.398
It's important that Rafa
have some consistency.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.860
You know, I never know which
one of you is picking him up
or dropping him off.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.030
Is that a problem? I mean,
it's always one of us.

08:50.905 --> 08:54.117
It's only a problem if
the messages I send home
with one of you

08:54.117 --> 08:55.618
don't get to the others.

08:55.618 --> 08:59.039
Oh right.
Uh, no stuffed animals
with button eyes.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.832
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐I heard that one.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.917
And I told your brother
this little guy

09:02.917 --> 09:05.045
suddenly became
a very picky eater.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.796
It may just be a phase, but

09:06.796 --> 09:10.592
I wanna make sure you don't
give up introducing new foods.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.303
‐Did he mention?
‐He definitely did.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.889
Uh. Which brother?

09:15.889 --> 09:18.600
(laugh)
See now I've forgotten myself.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.620
<i>Perdon, Señora.</i>

09:39.162 --> 09:40.789
No no. That wasn't optional.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.460
<i>Señora</i> , I don't...

09:45.919 --> 09:48.129
really think we have to waste
precious class time with‐‐

<i>‐Nervioso.</i>

10:08.650 --> 10:10.652
<i>‐Nervioso.</i>
‐Mm‐hmm.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.115
<i>Señora,</i> please.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.665

10:25.667 --> 10:27.794
"You've got all
the right equipment."

10:27.961 --> 10:29.879

10:31.214 --> 10:33.800
All:
Beto. Beto. Beto. Beto.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.301
(bell ringing)

10:40.473 --> 10:43.059
‐(Rafa crying)
‐Sorry.

10:43.476 --> 10:46.229
‐Took you long enough.
‐I came as fast as I could.
Give him.

10:47.021 --> 10:48.815
Has he thrown up again
since you called?

10:48.815 --> 10:50.400
A second time.
About a half an hour ago.

10:50.400 --> 10:52.485
‐Did you give him water?
‐He won't take any.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.737
‐Yeah.
‐(Rafa crying)

10:54.737 --> 10:58.074
‐He's a little pale.
‐I'm telling you,
there's something wrong.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.742
Okay, maybe it's a,
you know, a stomach thing.

to the hospital.

all day today. Not once.

Rafa has lead poisoning.

24:30.928 --> 24:33.973
We talked to the doctors.
That's what caused his seizure.

24:35.140 --> 24:38.602
‐Someone poisoned him?
‐No. No, no.
It's not like that.

24:39.186 --> 24:41.730
There can be lead in things
like, uh, old paint.

24:42.231 --> 24:44.233
It could have come from
something he chewed on
in the house.

24:45.359 --> 24:48.570
‐Could it have been
something I gave him?
‐No. No...

24:49.822 --> 24:51.281
Is he gonna be okay?

24:55.828 --> 24:59.665
Well they need to remove
the lead from his system and...
there's a treatment for that.

24:59.665 --> 25:02.334
And if it works, he should
start to get better.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.460
"If it works"?

25:05.004 --> 25:07.506
Wh‐‐ The doctors are
optimistic, Val.

25:08.215 --> 25:10.384
He has to stay in
the hospital overnight.

25:11.218 --> 25:14.346
Right. And they won't
release him until we know that
there's no lead in the house.

25:14.596 --> 25:16.682
I've got testers coming
first thing in the morning.

25:16.682 --> 25:18.058
And if they find anything,
they'll remove it.

25:19.977 --> 25:21.979
‐I thought he was gonna‐‐
‐Beto: Hey.

25:23.480 --> 25:24.606
We got lucky. Huh?

25:25.607 --> 25:27.192
Someone was
looking out for us.

25:30.237 --> 25:33.073
You guys go home, all right,
sleep in your own beds.

25:33.407 --> 25:35.909
I'll call the school
first thing and let them
know you'll be absent.

25:35.909 --> 25:36.994
Lucía:
What about you?

25:37.619 --> 25:39.705
Go. Sleep for a few hours.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.749
Check in at the restaurant
in the morning, if you need to.

25:41.749 --> 25:42.958
I'll stay.

Beto! Get down here! Now!

27:08.001 --> 27:11.130
If you'd given us
a little notice...

27:11.130 --> 27:14.133
Beto!
Social Services is here!

27:15.008 --> 27:17.511
It's not usually this messy.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.638
Drop‐in visits are routine

27:19.638 --> 27:21.348
when a child is admitted
to the hospital

27:21.348 --> 27:23.308
and there's potential
that his condition

27:23.308 --> 27:25.811
is the result
of neglect or trauma.

27:25.811 --> 27:28.230
There‐there hasn't been
any trauma or neglect.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.356
He got lead poisoned.

27:29.356 --> 27:31.441
Does someone think
we did that on purpose?

27:31.441 --> 27:32.943
No. Of course not.

27:33.569 --> 27:35.237
Still, we're obligated
to make sure

27:35.237 --> 27:37.364
the child is returning to
a safe home environment.

27:37.990 --> 27:41.034
So with your permission
I'm going to have to do
a quick assess‐‐

27:43.579 --> 27:44.663
I'm gonna go.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.836
Eh... later.

27:53.547 --> 27:55.465
That was... one sec.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.468
‐Lucía?
‐Oh God, no.

27:58.468 --> 27:59.636
Gross.

27:59.636 --> 28:01.430
Ella's just a friend.

28:01.847 --> 28:05.017
Uh, she's staying over.
So we could, uh, you know‐‐

28:05.017 --> 28:07.644
Uh, keep her updated
on Rafa's condition.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.271
She was, uh, very concerned.

28:11.189 --> 28:12.858
Shall we start upstairs?

28:13.150 --> 28:14.860
This is <i>Mami</i> and <i>Papi's</i> room.

Beto:

28:19.406 --> 28:21.825
Mexico.
San Miguel de Allende.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.536
It's about a few hours
outside of Mexico City.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.204
Coming back when?

28:26.872 --> 28:29.041
They're not coming back.
Not for a long time.

28:30.626 --> 28:34.087
I'm sorry. That's in here.
I just didn't get a chance
to fully review.

28:34.546 --> 28:36.965
‐And your legal guardian...
‐Oh, that's Emilio.

28:36.965 --> 28:39.259
He's 24,
and very responsible.

28:39.259 --> 28:41.219
He runs a very
successful restaurant.

28:41.219 --> 28:43.263
Los Cantaritos.
Ever heard of it?

28:43.472 --> 28:45.474
You ever want to take
a loved one there, we...

28:46.808 --> 28:47.851
Okay.

28:50.312 --> 28:53.398
‐Umm...
‐Oh yeah. I was locked in.

28:53.607 --> 28:54.650
They lock you in?

28:55.233 --> 28:57.694
No, no, that's‐‐
There was this situation...

29:00.822 --> 29:02.866
‐Call Emilio.
‐Mm‐hmm.

29:03.533 --> 29:05.160
(blowing wind)

29:05.494 --> 29:08.163
Can I get some snaps?
Everyone at the restaurant
has been asking.

29:08.163 --> 29:10.499
Are you just going to pretend
you didn't hear me?

29:10.499 --> 29:12.960
Are you really surprised that
someone who claimed to be

29:12.960 --> 29:14.836
selling me her child's
social security number

29:14.836 --> 29:16.672
turns out not to be
a model citizen?

29:16.672 --> 29:18.507
So the scam was a scam.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.635
Who knows how many people
she sold that number to.

29:21.635 --> 29:24.805
Regardless. It doesn't
make me using it more illegal
than it was before.

29:24.805 --> 29:26.598
No, but it makes it riskier.

29:28.600 --> 29:31.478
Say ICE nabs some guy,
runs a check

29:31.478 --> 29:33.897
and sees dozens
of other people using
the same number.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.024
Including some dishwasher
at Los Cantaritos.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.192
Well, what are my options?

29:37.192 --> 29:38.819
‐And don't say‐‐
‐DACA!

29:38.819 --> 29:39.695
No, Lucía!

29:40.237 --> 29:42.489
That's dangerous for me
in a totally different way.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.450
Yeah, but it'd make it safer
for Emilio to employ you.

29:46.785 --> 29:50.205
I'm sorry, but I gotta
think about what it means
for him. And for us.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.207
Look, there's another way
to keep everyone out of this.

29:54.292 --> 29:57.170
I can quit.
I'll quit. I'll...

29:57.170 --> 30:00.257
I'll go back to doing odd jobs
for whatever someone'll pay me.

30:00.257 --> 30:03.135
‐It's okay.
I've done it before.
‐I don't want you to quit.

30:03.677 --> 30:06.138
Neither does Emilio. He says
you're doing a great job‐‐

30:06.138 --> 30:08.598
‐What do you want, Lucía?
‐I just want everyone
to be safe!

30:09.933 --> 30:12.269
You. Emilio. Rafa.

30:16.523 --> 30:19.401
‐Maybe you can find
another number.
‐Luce, come on.

30:20.485 --> 30:23.530
Unless we know exactly
where it comes from
and who it comes from.

30:24.489 --> 30:25.824
It wouldn't change a thing.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.289
All his vaccines,
completely up to date.

30:32.289 --> 30:35.834
Uh, let me see. Strawberries,
scrambled eggs, bananas.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.836
We make sure to cut everything
into bite‐sized pieces.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.297
We're introducing
new foods slowly.

30:40.297 --> 30:43.258
Growth milestones.
What do you mean?

30:43.258 --> 30:45.677
He's right on schedule
according to his pediatrician.

30:45.677 --> 30:47.137
Very nearly walking.

30:47.137 --> 30:48.805
Next couple of weeks
we figure.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.807
Me? You're asking about me?

30:51.016 --> 30:53.477
I'm fine. I'm great.
Doing well at school.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.145
All the kids are.

30:55.145 --> 30:57.230
I pulled it up to C‐plus.

30:57.230 --> 30:59.149
My sister's been helping me.

30:59.691 --> 31:02.069
‐Other sister.
‐Not that I couldn't.

31:02.569 --> 31:04.571
Inez Buendia's Daycare
on Douglas.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.908
Inez is super nice.
Rafa's crazy about her.

31:07.908 --> 31:09.534
Sometimes he cries
when it's time to go.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.620
Not that he doesn't
wanna be with us.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.456
Oh no. He does.
He totally does.

31:14.456 --> 31:16.500
He loves us. Like family.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.795
Which we are. Obviously.

31:20.670 --> 31:23.131
We love him. We'd never let
anything bad happen to him.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.341
We swear.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.927
What else have you got,
Mr. Nichols?

31:31.223 --> 31:33.058
Look, there's laundry
in the hamper

31:33.058 --> 31:34.309
and dishes in the sink.

31:34.309 --> 31:35.727
And that broken lock thing
looks weird.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.896
And maybe we're a day late
on the phone bill.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.108
But that little boy
is loved and cared for.

31:42.567 --> 31:46.071
He's happy. Which, under
the circumstances,
is kind of a miracle.

31:48.949 --> 31:51.743
Look, I hope, I really hope
that you can see...

31:52.702 --> 31:54.663
that however much better we
could be at taking care of him,

31:56.790 --> 31:58.708
right now we're good enough
for him to come back home to.

32:00.752 --> 32:04.464
Are your parents aware
of what's going on with Rafa?

32:05.966 --> 32:08.135
Please don't call 'em, sir.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.804
It's hard enough for them
being so far away.

32:10.804 --> 32:11.805
They don't need to worry.

32:15.225 --> 32:16.226
I've got this.

32:19.604 --> 32:21.982
You realize that's what
a parent would say.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.616
You're taking care
of them, too?

32:34.119 --> 32:35.162
Yeah, I guess so.

32:37.247 --> 32:38.331
Guess I am.

32:45.463 --> 32:47.132
It came from the daycare.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.426
‐The lead poisoning?
‐Mm‐hmm.

32:50.594 --> 32:51.803
How is that possible?

32:52.596 --> 32:54.931
Remember those cribs that Inez
bought a few months ago
at the yard sale?

32:55.432 --> 32:57.934
‐Uh, from the family of
grown triplets, she said.
‐Yeah.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.645
Well, no one ever thought
to check to see if
the paint was safe.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.856
And you know how
Rafa's been teething.

33:02.856 --> 33:04.024
So he's been chewing on...

33:05.108 --> 33:06.693
God. Poison?

33:07.861 --> 33:09.279
What about the other kids?

33:09.279 --> 33:11.072
Uh, well they're getting
checked out,

33:11.072 --> 33:12.908
but so far, only Rafa
showed symptoms.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.035
But that means
our house is clear.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.661
Are they gonna
shut the daycare down?

33:17.537 --> 33:19.164
‐I dunno.
‐Well, they should.

33:19.873 --> 33:21.666
Inez should have
been more careful.

33:21.666 --> 33:23.335
He can't ever go back there.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.338
You don't think it was
an honest mistake?

33:27.464 --> 33:29.049
What difference does it make?

33:29.966 --> 33:31.551
I mean, honest or not.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.181
Rafa could have died.

33:37.641 --> 33:39.142
What did she do
that I wouldn't have done?

33:40.060 --> 33:41.228
I mean, I've found
stuff on the curb,

33:41.228 --> 33:42.812
brought it home without
it ever occurring to me

33:42.812 --> 33:44.898
that it needed anything more
than a good cleaning.

33:45.357 --> 33:48.526
Well, how could you be expected
to know that's dangerous?

33:48.526 --> 33:51.780
I mean, Emilio.
She takes care of children.

33:53.406 --> 33:54.366
Don't I?

33:55.492 --> 33:57.244
(Ella and Beto laughing)

34:02.082 --> 34:03.625
I'm gonna make

That instinct.

You know how you could
just walk in the door,

and <i>Papi</i> would know
in an instant.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.539
Just from the way
you sat on the couch,

35:24.539 --> 35:25.707
that you'd been
fired from your job.

35:26.374 --> 35:28.918
Well, actually, I've never
really had a job.

She knew.

35:37.844 --> 35:39.012
Over the phone.

35:43.516 --> 35:45.268
It probably took them a while.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.396
To develop, like,
a second sense.

35:48.897 --> 35:51.566
They had kids gradually.
You had them overnight.

really apologize.

Do you think I'll be
any good at it?

37:00.385 --> 37:02.470
I mean, what does
your gut tell you?

37:05.640 --> 37:06.808
I think you'd be great.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.469
(shutter clicks)

37:45.305 --> 37:46.264
(elevator dings)

37:51.227 --> 37:54.439
Excuse me. I'm looking
for my daughter.

37:54.439 --> 37:56.441
They didn't have a record of her
being admitted downstairs.

37:56.441 --> 37:58.860
But I saw a picture of her
in front of signage...

37:58.860 --> 37:59.694
Dad?!

38:00.361 --> 38:02.572
‐What are you doing?
‐What are you doing here?!

38:02.572 --> 38:03.782
Oh Jesus, Ella.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.409
I got a call from the school
saying you were truant.

38:06.409 --> 38:08.328
I texted you. I called you.

38:08.328 --> 38:11.039
And then I see on Instagram
that you're in a hospital
in a wheelchair.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.333
No, no. We were just
fooling around.

38:13.666 --> 38:16.127
It's Beto's baby brother,
Rafa, who's the patient.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.796
‐Who is Beto?
‐Beto.

38:18.463 --> 38:19.798
You know, from the party?

38:20.465 --> 38:22.383
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Barnett.

38:22.383 --> 38:23.802
What are you doing
with that kid?

38:24.803 --> 38:26.137
Beto and I are together now.

38:27.180 --> 38:29.390
Right. Get your stuff.

38:30.225 --> 38:31.976
Ella's been very helpful to me

38:31.976 --> 38:33.478
and my family the past
couple days, sir.

38:33.478 --> 38:35.563
Ever since my little brother
had his seizure.

38:35.563 --> 38:37.524
Uh‐huh. Uh‐huh.
Well, she's going home
with me right now.

38:37.524 --> 38:39.067
Like hell I am!

38:39.067 --> 38:41.194
Don't you at least want to ask
how his little brother is?

38:44.280 --> 38:45.698
How's he doing? Is he okay?

38:46.241 --> 38:48.409
‐They're releasing him
in the morning.
‐That's good.

38:50.537 --> 38:51.579
Now let's go.

38:51.579 --> 38:52.997
No. You don't get to tell me‐‐

38:52.997 --> 38:54.249
Jim:
Do you wanna make
a scene, Eloise?

38:54.249 --> 38:55.500
Then make a scene.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.836
I'm not leaving here
without you.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.295
Um, maybe you should
just go.

39:00.255 --> 39:01.673
'Cause this is a hospital.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.174
Maybe if there's gonna
be yelling...

39:03.174 --> 39:05.677
this isn't, like,
the best place.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.569
I'm gonna go home
for their sake.

39:23.236 --> 39:24.237
But just so you know,

39:24.946 --> 39:26.614
Beto and I are in love.

39:27.073 --> 39:29.409
And there's nothing
you can do about that.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.250
I had no idea.

39:38.585 --> 39:39.627
Me neither.

39:50.805 --> 39:52.015
Thank you.

39:52.015 --> 39:54.058
Hey. Mornin'!

39:54.726 --> 39:55.935
I assume you heard
the good news?

39:56.394 --> 39:57.604
Rafa's being discharged.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.815
‐We're being discharged.
‐I did hear. That's great.

40:01.316 --> 40:02.650
And I assume you had
something to do with it. Right?

40:03.192 --> 40:04.611
We needed a stamp
of approval from you

40:04.611 --> 40:05.653
in order to
bring him home.

40:05.653 --> 40:06.905
(laughs)
Yeah, well...

40:07.697 --> 40:08.990
I'm just glad
it all worked out.

40:09.699 --> 40:10.617
I'll be in touch.

40:11.743 --> 40:14.829
I‐‐ I don't think there's
gonna be any more news.

40:15.371 --> 40:16.706
I mean, the house
cleared inspection.

40:16.706 --> 40:18.416
Rafa won't be
returning to that daycare.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.460
And his doctor said
he'll just keep on getting
better and better.

40:20.460 --> 40:22.670
So, I think that's
everything. Yeah.

40:23.671 --> 40:26.633
Right. Well, uh...
A file has been opened.

40:27.508 --> 40:28.676
I'm your case manager now.

40:29.218 --> 40:30.637
That's going to be ongoing.

40:32.472 --> 40:34.891
Uh, I don't understand.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.936
Well, a single visit doesn't
give me a clear enough picture

40:37.936 --> 40:41.856
of how you and your family
are managing a very
tough situation.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.984
That's something that can really
only be assessed over time

40:44.984 --> 40:46.277
and with continued observation.

40:47.362 --> 40:49.447
The welfare of these children
is your responsibility.

40:49.447 --> 40:50.698
But now it's mine, too.
