CRISTELA,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:00.025 --> 21:01.160
NOTHING.

21:03.062 --> 21:05.598
YOU KNOW YOU'VE RUINED
MARRIAGE FOR ME.

21:05.598 --> 21:08.267
'CAUSE I'M NOT WILLING
TO SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS

21:08.267 --> 21:10.503
THAN WHAT
YOU GUYS HAVE.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.343
OKAY, YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.
IT'S GETTING WEIRD.

21:20.045 --> 21:21.413
IT FEELS RIGHT
TO ME.
