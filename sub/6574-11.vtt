Season 2 Episode 11

00:58.111 --> 01:00.521
<i>Secretary Tseng and I
are so glad.</i>

01:00.532 --> 01:02.299
You accepted
the Reach's invitation.

01:02.367 --> 01:03.967
To meet, Captain.

01:04.034 --> 01:07.136
[Camera shutters click]

01:07.689 --> 01:10.689
The Justice League
always supports peaceful diplomacy.

01:10.973 --> 01:12.707
And should diplomacy fail,

01:12.775 --> 01:16.211
you have your wanted
meta powers to enforce peace.

01:16.278 --> 01:18.213
Not how we operate, ambassador.

01:18.280 --> 01:21.115
But we can discuss that
in private.

01:21.183 --> 01:23.884
If you insist.

01:23.952 --> 01:25.753
Private meeting?

01:25.820 --> 01:28.789
Is this an April
Fools' day prank,

01:28.856 --> 01:31.291
or just another example
of the League.

01:31.359 --> 01:34.160
Hiding their true agenda
from you,

01:34.228 --> 01:35.494
the people?

01:35.562 --> 01:38.063
Don't know why you're
surprised, folks.

01:38.131 --> 01:43.902
After all, most of
your heroes wear masks.

01:48.573 --> 01:50.740
[Tapping]

01:59.016 --> 02:01.250
Oh. Ah, sorry.

02:01.318 --> 02:03.853
[Tapping]

02:07.057 --> 02:08.924
Thank you, Ty.

02:08.991 --> 02:10.225
Virgil.

02:13.063 --> 02:14.263
Ty!

02:14.330 --> 02:15.864
Hold, Jaime Reyes.

02:15.932 --> 02:18.666
The Ty Longshadow does not
know us in this form.

02:18.734 --> 02:22.137
Time to stretch!

02:22.204 --> 02:24.439
Yep, got to keep limber.

02:26.042 --> 02:28.643
Virgil, I know you've
been through a lot,

02:28.711 --> 02:31.880
but I'd still like to ask you a few
questions about your abduction.

02:31.948 --> 02:33.182
Well, here's one.

02:33.250 --> 02:34.550
Why am I on camera?

02:34.618 --> 02:36.552
To make sure I remember
what you say.

02:36.620 --> 02:38.387
I'm speaking to everyone,

02:38.455 --> 02:39.988
to provide counsel,

02:40.056 --> 02:42.524
but also to find out
exactly what happened.

02:42.592 --> 02:44.026
And hopefully gain some insight.

02:44.093 --> 02:45.661
As to why the Reach chose you.

02:45.729 --> 02:47.696
I don't know why they chose me,

02:47.764 --> 02:49.699
but I know they wanted
to break me.

02:49.766 --> 02:51.300
Why do you say that?

02:52.436 --> 02:53.569
The tests.

02:53.636 --> 02:55.304
They started out small,

02:55.372 --> 02:57.472
little static shocks,

02:57.540 --> 02:59.907
but they kept upping the juice.

02:59.975 --> 03:03.977
Till it felt like I was
being eaten by lightning.

03:04.045 --> 03:07.247
Still, I was one of
the lucky ones.

03:07.314 --> 03:09.682
The alien creepazoids
didn't seem to like.

03:09.750 --> 03:12.017
The results they got
from some of the other kids.

03:12.085 --> 03:14.520
Kids I never saw again.

03:14.588 --> 03:15.955
Look, when can I go home?

03:16.022 --> 03:17.656
My family's probably
worried sick.

03:17.724 --> 03:19.291
It won't be long.

03:19.359 --> 03:22.562
For now, if you'd wait
in the Hall.

03:36.809 --> 03:38.543
Nice.

03:38.611 --> 03:40.478
Perfect cover for our new digs.

03:40.546 --> 03:43.581
On the outside, I mean,
it's downright nasty.

03:43.649 --> 03:47.352
And it's nasty
on the inside, too.

03:47.419 --> 03:48.686
April Fools, right?

03:48.754 --> 03:52.122
I mean, this is
the team's new HQ?

03:52.190 --> 03:54.391
Where's the secret trapdoor
to our real base?

03:54.459 --> 03:55.926
No secret trapdoor.

03:55.993 --> 03:58.161
And it's not our new HQ.

03:58.229 --> 03:59.595
For the time being,
we'll operate.

03:59.663 --> 04:01.497
Out of the basement
of the Hall of Justice.

04:01.565 --> 04:03.198
This is just a place to crash.

04:03.266 --> 04:06.067
A very temporary stop gap
place to crash.

04:06.135 --> 04:08.837
For those of you who were
actually living at the cave.

04:08.904 --> 04:10.471
It's fine.

04:10.539 --> 04:13.374
[Growls]

04:13.441 --> 04:16.543
I'm sorry about
the lack of privacy, M'gann.

04:16.611 --> 04:18.211
This curtain will
have to do for now,

04:18.279 --> 04:19.629
but we'll figure
something else out.

04:19.647 --> 04:21.880
Oh, no. No way.

04:21.947 --> 04:23.082
I am out.

04:23.149 --> 04:24.450
I'm heading for the Hall.

04:24.518 --> 04:26.718
Where I'm making other
arrangements, my friend.

04:26.886 --> 04:28.286
You two should go along.

04:28.354 --> 04:29.887
Pick up the boxes of your stuff.

04:29.955 --> 04:31.589
We salvaged from Mount Justice.

04:31.656 --> 04:36.156
It might help this warehouse
feel more like a warehome.

04:41.511 --> 04:43.846
I'm telling you,
it's a pit, beautiful.

04:43.914 --> 04:47.617
So I figured I'd just
crash with you.

04:47.684 --> 04:49.485
Uh, now?

04:49.553 --> 04:50.887
I mean, I'd love that,

04:50.954 --> 04:53.089
but I'm studying all the time,

04:53.157 --> 04:55.024
and, you know, know
how small my place is.

04:55.092 --> 04:58.061
I'm not even sure I'm
allowed to have crashers.

04:58.129 --> 04:59.630
[Beeping]

04:59.697 --> 05:04.402
Greetings and salutationisms,
earth champions.

05:10.510 --> 05:14.180
I am L-Ron, major domo
to the great master.

05:14.247 --> 05:16.015
And you are my prisoners.

05:16.082 --> 05:18.951
This is Plastic Man's
April Fools joke, isn't it?

05:19.019 --> 05:21.921
Ok, Plas, you got us.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.091
No, I have you.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.865
Though not for myself,
of course.

05:31.932 --> 05:35.135
Rather, I hold you here
at the behest of my master,

05:35.203 --> 05:40.440
who seeks to prove himself against
earth's greatest warriors.

05:42.077 --> 05:43.678
[Growls]

05:43.745 --> 05:46.214
Ohh!

05:48.083 --> 05:51.653
Let the cage match begin.

05:51.721 --> 05:54.056
No fooling.

05:58.345 --> 05:59.579
Magic user, master.

05:59.646 --> 06:02.314
[Casting spell]

06:04.784 --> 06:07.352
Nah, uh-uh.
Magicism is cheating.

06:07.420 --> 06:10.154
Master's more
the hands-on type.

06:10.222 --> 06:13.958
Allow me to introduce
my master...

06:14.025 --> 06:16.486
The Warlord Despero,

06:16.554 --> 06:19.912
gladiatorial champion
of 92 star systems.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.610
Working on 93 now.

06:21.678 --> 06:23.742
He has come to this
backwater planet.

06:23.809 --> 06:26.073
Seeking a challenge
to prove his superiority.

06:26.141 --> 06:27.805
To all life forms.

06:27.872 --> 06:30.535
It's quite the complimentism.
You really should feel honored.

06:30.602 --> 06:31.968
Oh, I am.

06:32.035 --> 06:34.099
Here, let me show him.

06:34.167 --> 06:36.131
Uhh!

06:36.199 --> 06:38.461
Ahh!

06:38.529 --> 06:40.626
He needs backup.

06:43.589 --> 06:45.021
Uh...

06:45.089 --> 06:47.186
The force field around
the Hall is blocking all com.

06:47.251 --> 06:48.716
Zeta tube's down, too.

06:48.784 --> 06:50.180
We're on our own.

06:50.248 --> 06:51.780
Uhh!

06:52.980 --> 06:56.374
Ahh!

06:56.442 --> 06:57.840
[Growls]

06:59.505 --> 07:00.303
Check on Zatanna.

07:00.371 --> 07:02.535
Thin head's mine.

07:02.602 --> 07:04.332
[Grunting]

07:04.400 --> 07:05.498
Zatanna?

07:05.565 --> 07:08.194
Wake up.

07:08.262 --> 07:11.027
Zatanna!

07:11.094 --> 07:14.389
Why do they always
make me do this?

07:17.153 --> 07:20.816
Ok. Then let's try
getting help.

07:25.245 --> 07:28.408
Think I'm losing my touch.

07:28.475 --> 07:32.336
Our people appreciate the
Reach's openness, ambassador.

07:32.404 --> 07:35.833
We believe there should
be no secrets among allies.

07:35.901 --> 07:38.696
Odd, since the Reach
spent so much time on earth.

07:38.764 --> 07:40.561
Before making
their presence known.

07:40.629 --> 07:43.958
We did spend
a brief period observing.

07:44.026 --> 07:47.520
Out of concern the League
might attack us on sight.

07:47.588 --> 07:52.182
After all, you are wanted
criminals throughout the galaxy.

07:52.249 --> 07:53.481
Wanted criminals?

07:53.549 --> 07:55.846
It's complicated.

07:55.914 --> 07:58.843
And I suppose it was
also complicated.

07:58.911 --> 08:02.172
When you targeted my ship
with your young covert ops team?

08:02.239 --> 08:03.871
That's not what happened
and you know it.

08:03.939 --> 08:05.335
Are you saying you don't have.

08:05.403 --> 08:07.134
Young covert operatives,
Captain?

08:07.201 --> 08:10.431
Because I know from personal
experience that you do.

08:10.499 --> 08:12.496
The Reach had abducted
our people.

08:12.564 --> 08:13.762
Many people, in fact.

08:13.830 --> 08:16.092
Now he confuses us
with the Kroloteans.

08:16.159 --> 08:18.490
I suppose all aliens
look alike to him.

08:18.558 --> 08:20.856
These are serious
accusations, Captain.

08:20.923 --> 08:24.118
I assume you have
evidence, witnesses.

08:24.185 --> 08:26.116
Yes, Captain, witnesses.

08:26.184 --> 08:29.681
Perhaps some who don't number
among your teen protégés.

08:29.748 --> 08:32.510
Or young impressionable fans.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.943
[Beep]

08:34.010 --> 08:35.275
Captain Atom.

08:35.342 --> 08:38.837
What kind of situation
at the Hall?

09:02.480 --> 09:04.244
Uhh!

09:04.311 --> 09:08.039
Hmm. Not an impressive showing
for you earthlings thus far.

09:08.107 --> 09:09.937
[Growls]

09:11.771 --> 09:15.666
Big ugly's wiping the floor
with our heavy hitters.

09:15.733 --> 09:17.297
I tried stinging him,
but he didn't even feel it.

09:17.364 --> 09:20.461
Miss Martian, you have to
do something.

09:36.944 --> 09:37.744
Uhh!

09:38.077 --> 09:39.108
Come on, miss M.

09:39.176 --> 09:40.574
Brain blast him or something.

09:40.642 --> 09:42.439
No.

09:44.238 --> 09:46.435
Ohh!

09:49.299 --> 09:51.062
Uhh! Uhh!

09:54.892 --> 09:58.522
Ok, you got stuff,
I'll admit it.

09:58.590 --> 10:02.718
But I've still got one last
trick up my sleeve.

10:02.786 --> 10:04.282
Shazaam!

10:08.547 --> 10:11.209
Oh, man, I really
thought that would work.

10:11.276 --> 10:13.073
Flagrant foulism!

10:13.141 --> 10:15.918
My master has no interest
in fighting a child.

10:22.425 --> 10:23.492
[Growls]

10:23.560 --> 10:24.727
Um, yes, master.

10:24.794 --> 10:27.429
You will require
a new opponent.

10:28.398 --> 10:29.564
A-ha!

10:29.632 --> 10:32.299
This one wears the symbolism
of Superman,

10:32.367 --> 10:34.768
one of earth's
mightiest champions.

10:36.137 --> 10:38.004
[Growls]

10:38.072 --> 10:39.639
Lagoon boy.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.676
Aah!

10:44.744 --> 10:46.578
What'd you tell her, ese?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.948
About you betraying mankind and
causing the Reach apocalypse?

10:51.683 --> 10:53.750
Heh heh. Nada, amigo.

10:53.818 --> 10:56.219
See, I have no idea
what actually turns you.

10:56.287 --> 10:58.020
For all we know,
the League finding out.

10:58.088 --> 10:59.521
Could be the very thing
that makes it happen,

10:59.589 --> 11:02.390
so I say we say nothing
to no one.

11:02.458 --> 11:03.958
This is good.

11:04.026 --> 11:06.527
Now, kill him so he
can not change his mind.

11:06.595 --> 11:08.562
- Keep quiet.
- Exactly.

11:08.630 --> 11:12.198
Stick with me, Blue. I'll keep
you from feeling the mode.

11:12.266 --> 11:13.233
Grr!

11:13.300 --> 11:15.268
Uhh!

11:23.443 --> 11:25.076
Do you earthlings
truly have no concept.

11:25.144 --> 11:27.145
Of honorable single combat?

11:32.820 --> 11:35.088
Do not follow, earth females.

11:35.156 --> 11:36.256
Do not interfere.

11:36.323 --> 11:39.492
It is poor sportism.

11:42.296 --> 11:44.264
Uhh!

11:44.331 --> 11:45.898
[Growls]

11:45.966 --> 11:48.802
Ohh!

11:51.339 --> 11:53.240
Take his head, master.

11:53.307 --> 11:55.575
It will make
an excellent trophy.

11:57.311 --> 12:00.313
M'gann, now or never.

12:01.983 --> 12:02.983
Murderer!

12:03.051 --> 12:05.452
Aah!

12:05.520 --> 12:06.553
No.

12:06.621 --> 12:10.457
M'gann, what have you done?

12:10.525 --> 12:12.659
[Gasps] I can't.

12:22.294 --> 12:24.061
Did I get your attention?

12:30.936 --> 12:33.704
Master, they have no honor.

12:33.772 --> 12:36.874
It is time they pay in blood.

12:36.942 --> 12:40.278
There, master.
Start there.

12:42.414 --> 12:44.115
Enough!

12:45.017 --> 12:49.354
You want earth's
champion, you found him.

12:49.421 --> 12:51.422
Your scarab.
We all had assumed.

12:51.490 --> 12:54.025
It was an invention
of the previous Blue Beetle,

12:54.093 --> 12:56.927
but now it seems clear
the Reach created it.

12:56.995 --> 13:00.330
Uh, yeah, that's clear.

13:00.398 --> 13:03.768
There is no reason to believe
the Impulse's predictions.

13:03.835 --> 13:06.203
Perpetuating concern
would be a strategic error,

13:06.271 --> 13:09.272
putting us at risk
of persecution or worse.

13:09.340 --> 13:11.574
Yeah.
I mean, it's very clear.

13:11.642 --> 13:13.977
The Reach tried to use
my scarab to control me,

13:14.045 --> 13:15.411
but it wouldn't work for them.

13:15.479 --> 13:17.480
Their scientist said
the only way to reboot it.

13:17.548 --> 13:19.015
Was to kill me.

13:19.083 --> 13:22.285
So the Reach created it,
but they can't control it.

13:22.353 --> 13:26.489
Jaime, that may make you
our best weapon against them.

13:26.557 --> 13:29.926
Yeah. Something like that.

13:29.994 --> 13:31.795
Your fight is with me, alien.

13:31.863 --> 13:33.764
I am earth's Guardian.

13:33.831 --> 13:35.499
Its greatest champion.

13:35.567 --> 13:37.635
Its secret champion.

13:37.703 --> 13:40.104
He is not listed in
the Krolotean database, master,

13:40.172 --> 13:42.640
but their records
may be incomplete.

13:42.708 --> 13:44.910
Miss Martian, take
the others and leave.

13:44.977 --> 13:46.511
This is my fight alone.

13:46.579 --> 13:47.947
Mal, what are you doing?

13:48.014 --> 13:49.415
Keeping ugly busy,

13:49.482 --> 13:51.584
at least until you
and Superboy get a better idea.

13:51.651 --> 13:54.720
As you command, Guardian.

13:55.756 --> 13:58.090
Did you see how
she bowed to him?

13:58.157 --> 14:01.126
This Guardian must be
earth's true champion.

14:01.194 --> 14:02.694
Finally, master,

14:02.762 --> 14:04.863
a battle worthy
of your prowess.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.432
[Growls]

14:06.499 --> 14:08.067
[Groans]

14:08.134 --> 14:10.369
What happened?
Where's Mal?

14:10.437 --> 14:13.673
About to play the most important
game of keep away in my life.

14:13.740 --> 14:16.876
So how about you guys
figure out a plan "B."

14:16.944 --> 14:18.277
Fast.

14:18.345 --> 14:19.979
All right, freak.

14:20.046 --> 14:22.281
I could incinerate you
with a look,

14:22.349 --> 14:24.384
but you hurt my friends,

14:24.451 --> 14:28.121
so I'm gonna teach you
a lesson instead!

14:28.189 --> 14:29.722
Use cautionism, master.

14:29.790 --> 14:32.358
You don't know
this one's abilities.

14:32.426 --> 14:36.963
Strength of the earth
and power of all mankind,

14:37.031 --> 14:39.266
I summon you.

14:40.368 --> 14:43.169
Well, I'm waiting.

14:43.237 --> 14:46.540
Give me your best shot.

14:49.744 --> 14:52.646
Thank you, Black Canary.

14:52.714 --> 14:54.748
How could you leave Mal
there alone?

14:54.815 --> 14:57.184
Get your Martian mind
in the game.

14:57.252 --> 14:59.586
Nothing I've thrown
at the alien telekinetically.

14:59.654 --> 15:00.754
Has had any effect.

15:00.822 --> 15:02.757
And I can't attack him
psychically.

15:02.824 --> 15:04.091
I just can't.

15:04.159 --> 15:05.192
Then don't.

15:05.260 --> 15:08.595
But do something.

15:09.930 --> 15:13.433
You are going to reimburse us
for damages, right?

15:13.501 --> 15:14.968
Ahh!

15:19.674 --> 15:21.742
Come on, chatterbox.

15:21.810 --> 15:23.510
You gonna show me
something or not?

15:23.578 --> 15:25.612
[Growls]

15:25.680 --> 15:27.847
[Grunts]

15:27.915 --> 15:30.249
Uh, how we coming on
that plan "B"?

15:30.317 --> 15:32.919
Coming right up.

15:35.756 --> 15:40.060
Zatanna, Billy, Karen,
can you hear me?

15:40.128 --> 15:43.030
It feels like there are
blindfolds on your brains,

15:43.098 --> 15:45.032
and you need to help me
remove them.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.935
Now!
[Gasps]

15:49.704 --> 15:52.205
Master, he has no powers.

15:52.273 --> 15:54.975
This so-called champion
is merely another distraction.

15:55.043 --> 15:58.711
Neutralize him, then
take the other's head.

15:58.779 --> 16:00.546
[Growls]

16:00.614 --> 16:01.948
[Casts spell]

16:09.222 --> 16:11.857
Superboy, I've used
M'gann's link to possess Mal.

16:11.925 --> 16:13.758
And turn the alien's power
back on himself,

16:13.826 --> 16:15.494
but I don't know
how long it will last.

16:15.561 --> 16:17.196
Long enough.

16:21.167 --> 16:22.634
Cheaters!

16:22.702 --> 16:24.503
Sneaks! Frauds!

16:24.571 --> 16:28.840
You will all suffer
for your crimes.

16:29.609 --> 16:30.942
Let's try this again.

16:31.010 --> 16:32.177
Shazaam!

16:35.882 --> 16:38.951
Poor sportism!
Poor sportism!

16:39.018 --> 16:40.585
[Distorted] Poor sportism.

16:40.653 --> 16:42.754
Uhoh.

16:49.229 --> 16:51.096
[Casting spell]

17:05.913 --> 17:07.915
The others, are they...

17:11.752 --> 17:12.954
[Grunts]

17:13.021 --> 17:15.690
I can't believe that guy
Medusa'd me.

17:15.758 --> 17:18.526
Uh, why you dressed like that?

17:33.910 --> 17:36.378
Ok, together.

17:37.313 --> 17:39.481
[Both grunt]

17:42.317 --> 17:44.318
My spells aren't working,
either.

17:44.386 --> 17:47.287
We could try digging
our way out.

17:51.392 --> 17:53.894
Perhaps I might
be of some help.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.066
There.

18:00.134 --> 18:01.902
Problem solved.

18:01.969 --> 18:05.505
Thank you, ambassador.

18:05.573 --> 18:08.541
Such a shame your Hall
was destroyed.

18:08.609 --> 18:11.744
I suppose it is fortunate you still
have your other headquarters.

18:11.812 --> 18:13.613
The one in orbit above us now.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.348
What is it your call that one?

18:15.416 --> 18:17.050
The Watchtower?

18:17.117 --> 18:18.585
What?

18:19.787 --> 18:21.254
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:21.322 --> 18:24.257
Was that fact not
for public consumption?

18:24.324 --> 18:27.560
Did you hear that, folks?

18:27.628 --> 18:32.399
The Justice League has
their own eye in the sky.

18:32.466 --> 18:37.938
Spying on the very planet
they report to protect.

18:38.005 --> 18:42.709
Thank goodness for honest
allies like the Reach.

18:42.777 --> 18:46.078
And wise men like
Secretary Tseng,

18:46.146 --> 18:48.481
who has invited our new friends.

18:48.549 --> 18:52.385
To extend their stay on earth.

18:52.453 --> 18:53.953
Great.

18:54.021 --> 18:57.389
[Sighs] What happened
to your other arrangements?

18:57.457 --> 18:59.424
What would you guys
do without me?

18:59.492 --> 19:01.893
[Scoffs] Where's M'gann?

19:01.961 --> 19:05.664
She said the place was a bit
too much like a boys dorm.

19:05.732 --> 19:08.701
And as much as she likes
the smell of unwashed socks...

19:14.640 --> 19:18.342
Mr. Jones. I haven't
seen you in weeks.

19:18.410 --> 19:21.579
I have been traveling,
Mrs. Burkowitz.

19:21.646 --> 19:24.382
But it is good to be home.

19:31.891 --> 19:34.059
[Cell phone rings]

19:37.096 --> 19:40.599
[Ring]

19:40.666 --> 19:42.834
[Knock on door]

19:44.169 --> 19:46.938
M'gann, we need to talk.

19:52.778 --> 19:55.380
The Reach used
our own secrets against us,

19:55.448 --> 19:57.482
beat us without firing a shot,

19:57.550 --> 19:59.919
even offered to take
Despero off our hands.

19:59.987 --> 20:02.288
And I couldn't come up
with a reason to say no.

20:02.356 --> 20:04.357
Hope you have some good news.

20:04.425 --> 20:06.126
Some answers, at least.

20:06.194 --> 20:08.528
With the obvious exception
of Blue Beetle,

20:08.596 --> 20:10.863
the Reach abductees
are of two types...

20:10.931 --> 20:12.832
Those with a known superpower.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.735
And those with the potential
to develop one.

20:15.803 --> 20:18.538
I believe we now know
what a meta gene is...

20:18.606 --> 20:21.308
A genetic anomaly
that allows certain humans.

20:21.375 --> 20:23.210
To adapt new survival abilities.

20:23.277 --> 20:24.711
When exposed to trauma.

20:24.779 --> 20:26.247
The Reach, I think,

20:26.314 --> 20:29.416
seeks to cultivate the gene
and weaponize it.

20:29.484 --> 20:32.186
Which is probably what brought
the Reach and the Kroloteans.

20:32.254 --> 20:33.721
Here in the first place.

20:33.789 --> 20:36.657
All thanks to the light
sending the League to Rimbor.

20:36.725 --> 20:41.929
And putting earth and its heroes
square in the galactic spotlight.

20:41.997 --> 20:43.798
- Beetle?
- I'm sorry.

20:43.865 --> 20:45.433
I've been hiding something,

20:45.500 --> 20:48.102
but I can't...
I just can't.

20:48.170 --> 20:50.704
Uh, Blue, Blue, Blue.
What happened to keep quiet?

20:50.772 --> 20:54.575
Stop, Jaime Reyes.
This is a tactical error.

20:54.643 --> 20:56.811
No, time for the truth.

20:56.878 --> 20:58.946
Impulse says that
some time in the future

20:59.014 --> 21:02.016
I betray earth and bring on
a Reach apocalypse.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.284
That's not a future
I can live with.

21:04.352 --> 21:08.520
So whatever it takes,
get this scarab off me.
