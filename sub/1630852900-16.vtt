>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.901 --> 00:35.602
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.668 --> 00:38.571
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:38.638 --> 00:39.672
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:39.739 --> 00:40.039
US.

00:40.106 --> 00:41.374
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:41.441 --> 00:42.409
AND I'D LOVE TO TALK ABOUT THE

00:42.475 --> 00:43.610
FACT BEYONCE RELEASED A NEW

00:43.676 --> 00:45.979
SINGLE, OR THAT THIS FLOPPY KING

00:46.045 --> 00:46.579
BECAME THE FIRST BLOODHOUND TO

00:46.646 --> 00:47.180
WIN THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW.

00:47.247 --> 00:47.947
LOOK AT HIM!

00:48.014 --> 00:50.350
LOOK AT THAT WINGSPAN!

00:50.417 --> 00:52.318
HE LOOKS LIKE A STONED SEAPLANE!

00:52.385 --> 00:53.720
BUT SADLY, I CAN'T DO THAT,

00:53.787 --> 00:54.454
THANKS TO THE SUPREME COURT,

00:54.521 --> 00:55.789
WHICH HAD ITSELF A BANNER

00:55.855 --> 00:57.624
FUCKING WEEK.

00:57.690 --> 00:58.758
ON THURSDAY THEY STRUCK DOWN

00:58.825 --> 01:00.427
NEW YORK'S CONCEALED CARRY LAW,

01:00.493 --> 01:01.828
THEN ON FRIDAY, ONE-UPPED

01:01.895 --> 01:03.096
THEMSELVES WITH THIS:

01:03.163 --> 01:04.564
>> TONIGHT, THE LANDMARK RULING.

01:04.631 --> 01:06.966
THE SUPREME COURT OVERTURNING

01:07.033 --> 01:08.468
ROE V. WADE, TAKING AWAY THE

01:08.535 --> 01:09.536
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

01:09.602 --> 01:12.071
ABORTION.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.873
THE IMPACT ROUGHLY HALF THE

01:13.940 --> 01:15.575
STATES EXPECTED TO BAN ABORTION,

01:15.642 --> 01:17.310
13 STATES WITH TRIGGER LAWS

01:17.377 --> 01:17.944
BANNING ABORTION IMMEDIATELY OR

01:18.011 --> 01:18.812
SOON.

01:18.878 --> 01:20.713
>> John: YEAH.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.248
IT'S ABSOLUTELY HORRIFYING.

01:22.315 --> 01:24.117
AND LOOK, I KNOW FOR MANY OF YOU

01:24.184 --> 01:25.518
OUT THERE, THE VERY LAST THING

01:25.585 --> 01:26.519
YOU NEED RIGHT NOW IS FOR SOME

01:26.586 --> 01:27.587
WHITE GUY WHO'LL NEVER NEED AN

01:27.654 --> 01:29.556
ABORTION TO TELL YOU HOW BAD

01:29.622 --> 01:31.090
THINGS ARE IN A CADENCE THAT CAN

01:31.157 --> 01:32.358
BEST BE DESCRIBED AS "WHAT IF

01:32.425 --> 01:35.462
YOU SANG JOURNEY AT KARAOKE AND

01:35.528 --> 01:36.796
YOUR VOICE GOT STUCK," BUT WE

01:36.863 --> 01:37.630
ARE HERE AND WE'VE GOT TO TALK

01:37.697 --> 01:39.165
ABOUT THIS.

01:39.232 --> 01:39.766
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A HORRENDOUS

01:39.833 --> 01:40.934
FEW DAYS.

01:41.000 --> 01:42.569
AND WHAT'S MADE IT EVEN HARDER

01:42.635 --> 01:43.169
HAS BEEN HAVING TO WATCH SHIT

01:43.236 --> 01:44.704
LIKE THIS:

01:44.771 --> 01:46.439
>> ATTORNEY GENERAL KEN PAXTON

01:46.506 --> 01:47.273
SAYS HE'S CELEBRATING THE

01:47.340 --> 01:48.741
SUPREME COURT OPINION TODAY.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.610
HE ACTUALLY CLOSED HIS OFFICES

01:50.677 --> 01:51.511
AT NOON TODAY BECAUSE OF THIS

01:51.578 --> 01:52.946
DECISION.

01:53.012 --> 01:55.315
HE SAYS, GOING FORWARD, JUNE

01:55.381 --> 01:56.549
24TH WILL BE AN ANNUAL HOLIDAY

01:56.616 --> 01:57.684
FOR THE OFFICE OF THE ATTORNEY

01:57.750 --> 01:58.418
GENERAL.

01:58.485 --> 01:59.452
>> John: NOPE.

01:59.519 --> 02:02.288
FUCK YOU.

02:02.355 --> 02:02.755
[LAUGHTER]

02:02.822 --> 02:03.923
FIRST, JUNE 24TH IS ALREADY A

02:03.990 --> 02:04.858
HOLIDAY.

02:04.924 --> 02:05.859
IT'S SOLANGE'S BIRTHDAY AND SHE

02:05.925 --> 02:06.826
DOES NOT DESERVE THIS ON HER

02:06.893 --> 02:09.863
DAY.

02:09.929 --> 02:11.498
SECOND, NOBODY WANTS TO GO TO A

02:11.564 --> 02:13.266
"SANCTITY OF LIFE ANTI-CHOICE"

02:13.333 --> 02:14.300
COOKOUT, THE POTATO SALAD IS

02:14.367 --> 02:17.237
GOING TO BE TRASH.

02:17.303 --> 02:19.138
FINALLY, YOU DON'T GET A HOLIDAY

02:19.205 --> 02:22.108
TO CELEBRATE THE LOSS OF RIGHTS

02:22.175 --> 02:22.742
FOR MILLIONS OF PEOPLE, WHEN YOU

02:22.809 --> 02:23.376
ALREADY HAVE ONE, AND IT'S

02:23.443 --> 02:27.180
CALLED "COLUMBUS DAY."

02:27.247 --> 02:27.447
[APPLAUSE]

02:27.514 --> 02:28.448
IT IS HARD TO STOMACH SOME OF

02:28.515 --> 02:29.182
THE GLEEFUL RESPONSES RIGHT NOW.

02:29.249 --> 02:30.116
MIKE PENCE ISSUED THE STATEMENT,

02:30.183 --> 02:31.150
"LIFE WON," WHICH IS PRETTY

02:31.217 --> 02:32.752
TOUGH TO TAKE, GIVEN THAT FOR

02:32.819 --> 02:33.786
SOME, ESPECIALLY DISABLED PEOPLE

02:33.853 --> 02:34.754
AND OTHER VULNERABLE GROUPS,

02:34.821 --> 02:35.622
FORCED PREGNANCY COULD BE A

02:35.688 --> 02:37.390
DEATH SENTENCE.

02:37.457 --> 02:38.424
AND MAKE NO MISTAKE: THIS

02:38.491 --> 02:40.260
DECISION IS SWEEPING.

02:40.326 --> 02:41.861
IT SAYS STATES COULD LIMIT

02:41.928 --> 02:43.963
ABORTION AT ALL STAGES OF

02:44.030 --> 02:47.567
DEVELOPMENT -- PHRASING THAT

02:47.634 --> 02:50.336
COULD MEAN FROM THE MOMENT OF

02:50.403 --> 02:50.904
CONCEPTION ONWARD, WITH NO

02:50.970 --> 02:51.838
EXCEPTIONS.

02:51.905 --> 02:52.772
AND WHILE THE SUPREME COURT'S

02:52.839 --> 02:53.439
CONSTANTLY DISAPPOINTING, I

02:53.506 --> 02:54.407
GUESS IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT

02:54.474 --> 02:58.144
SURPRISING.

02:58.211 --> 02:58.912
THE INTERVIEW PROCESS WHERE

02:58.978 --> 02:59.879
YOU CAN SAY -- AND I QUOTE --

02:59.946 --> 03:00.613
"YES, WE DRANK BEER.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.048
MY FRIENDS AND I.

03:02.115 --> 03:02.448
BOYS AND GIRLS.

03:02.515 --> 03:03.349
YES, WE DRANK BEER.

03:03.416 --> 03:03.917
I LIKED BEER.

03:03.983 --> 03:05.084
STILL LIKE BEER.

03:05.151 --> 03:06.853
WE DRANK BEER," AND STILL GET

03:06.920 --> 03:07.487
THE JOB, DOESN'T NECESSARILY

03:07.554 --> 03:10.256
PRODUCE THE BEST RESULTS.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.624
[LAUGHTER]

03:11.691 --> 03:12.659
NOW, SOME SUPPORTERS OF THE

03:12.725 --> 03:15.361
DECISION HAVE TRIED TO MINIMIZE

03:15.428 --> 03:16.062
ITS IMPACTS, CLAIMING IT

03:16.129 --> 03:16.729
MERELY RETURNS THE ISSUE TO THE

03:16.796 --> 03:18.064
STATES.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.432
OTHERS SAID THAT PEOPLE CAN JUST

03:19.499 --> 03:20.500
CHOOSE TO HAVE THEIR MANDATORY

03:20.567 --> 03:21.868
BABY ADOPTED, OR GO TO A STATE

03:21.935 --> 03:23.570
THAT ALLOWS ABORTION.

03:23.636 --> 03:25.405
BUT FIRST, EVEN WHEN PLANNED,

03:25.471 --> 03:27.140
PREGNANCY IS, BEST-CASE

03:27.206 --> 03:28.775
SCENARIO, A MAJOR MEDICAL EVENT

03:28.841 --> 03:30.243
THAT RIPS OPEN YOUR BUTT,

03:30.310 --> 03:31.477
REARRANGES YOUR ORGANS, THEN

03:31.544 --> 03:32.845
PUTS THEM BACK IN WRONG, AND

03:32.912 --> 03:34.380
ANYONE WHO GENUINELY ADVOCATES

03:34.447 --> 03:36.282
ADOPTION AS A REASONABLE

03:36.349 --> 03:37.150
ALTERNATIVE HAS CLEARLY NEVER

03:37.216 --> 03:40.353
HEARD THE WORD "PROLAPSE."

03:40.420 --> 03:41.321
[LAUGHTER]

03:41.387 --> 03:42.622
AND THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN SIMPLY

03:42.689 --> 03:43.623
SEEK AN ABORTION IN ANOTHER

03:43.690 --> 03:45.124
STATE IS INSULTING ON ITS FACE,

03:45.191 --> 03:46.326
EVEN BEFORE YOU CONSIDER THAT

03:46.392 --> 03:47.460
SOME LAWMAKERS ARE ALREADY

03:47.527 --> 03:48.995
OPENLY LOOKING FOR WAYS TO

03:49.062 --> 03:51.598
PUNISH OUT-OF-STATE ABORTIONS.

03:51.664 --> 03:52.465
IN SOME WAYS, WE'RE IN UNCHARTED

03:52.532 --> 03:54.133
TERRITORY HERE.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.136
BECAUSE WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY

03:57.203 --> 03:58.137
WE'RE RETURNING TO A PRE-ROE

03:58.204 --> 03:58.771
LANDSCAPE, THAT'S NOT ENTIRELY

03:58.838 --> 03:59.939
TRUE.

04:00.006 --> 04:05.378
THIS IS A DIFFERENT WORLD NOW.

04:05.445 --> 04:06.245
IN SOME WAYS, IT'S BETTER.

04:06.312 --> 04:07.380
THERE ARE NEW, LESS INVASIVE

04:07.447 --> 04:08.548
WAYS FOR PEOPLE TO TERMINATE

04:08.615 --> 04:09.582
PREGNANCIES, LIKE WITH

04:09.649 --> 04:10.316
MEDICATIONS.

04:10.383 --> 04:11.317
BUT THERE ARE ALSO NEW WAYS FOR

04:11.384 --> 04:12.018
THE STATE TO MONITOR PEOPLE.

04:12.085 --> 04:12.952
MEANING THAT IN STATES WHERE

04:13.019 --> 04:15.254
ABORTION WILL NOW BE OUTLAWED,

04:15.321 --> 04:16.689
ANY PREGNANCY LOSS PAST AN EARLY

04:16.756 --> 04:20.326
CUTOFF CAN NOW POTENTIALLY BE

04:20.393 --> 04:20.927
INVESTIGATED AS A CRIME, WHICH

04:20.994 --> 04:21.794
IN TURN MEANS SEARCH HISTORIES,

04:21.861 --> 04:22.795
BROWSING HISTORIES, TEXT

04:22.862 --> 04:24.130
MESSAGES, LOCATION DATA, PAYMENT

04:24.197 --> 04:26.299
DATA, INFORMATION FROM

04:26.366 --> 04:27.300
PERIOD-TRACKING APPS --

04:27.367 --> 04:29.168
PROSECUTORS CAN EXAMINE ALL OF

04:29.235 --> 04:30.637
THAT IF THEY BELIEVE THE LOSS OF

04:30.703 --> 04:31.204
A PREGNANCY MAY HAVE BEEN

04:31.270 --> 04:32.138
DELIBERATE.

04:32.205 --> 04:33.740
AND THAT IS NOT THE ONLY

04:33.806 --> 04:34.607
PANDORA'S BOX THIS RULING HAS

04:34.674 --> 04:35.775
OPENED.

04:35.842 --> 04:37.410
BECAUSE CLARENCE THOMAS, IN HIS

04:37.477 --> 04:38.177
CONCURRENCE, INDICATED HE'D

04:38.244 --> 04:39.145
ACTUALLY LIKE TO GO A LITTLE

04:39.212 --> 04:41.781
FURTHER.

04:41.848 --> 04:43.449
>> HE WRITES, QUOTE, "IN FUTURE

04:43.516 --> 04:46.519
CASES, WE SHOULD RECONSIDER ALL

04:46.586 --> 04:48.054
OF THIS COURT'S SUBSTANTIVE DUE

04:48.121 --> 04:49.455
PROCESS PRECEDENTS, INCLUDING

04:49.522 --> 04:50.923
GRISWOLD, LAWRENCE, AND

04:50.990 --> 04:52.659
OBERGEFELL."

04:52.725 --> 04:54.927
HE'S TALKING ABOUT RECONSIDERING

04:54.994 --> 04:56.863
DECISIONS ON GAY RIGHTS AND THE

04:56.929 --> 04:58.731
RIGHT TO CONTRACEPTION.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.733
>> John: YEAH, CLARENCE THOMAS

05:00.800 --> 05:01.634
WANTS TO UPHOLD THE SANCTITY OF

05:01.701 --> 05:03.102
MARRIAGE.

05:03.169 --> 05:04.904
BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW, MARRIAGE

05:04.971 --> 05:06.472
IS BETWEEN ONE MAN CREDIBLY

05:06.539 --> 05:07.974
ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND

05:08.041 --> 05:08.808
ONE WOMAN WHO WANTED TO

05:08.875 --> 05:09.542
OVERTHROW A PRESIDENTIAL

05:09.609 --> 05:11.044
ELECTION.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.446
Y'KNOW, THE WAY GOD INTENDED.

05:13.513 --> 05:14.814
[LAUGHTER]

05:14.881 --> 05:15.882
NOW, ON ONE HAND, THE MAJORITY

05:15.948 --> 05:17.016
DECISION DOES STATE THAT IT ONLY

05:17.083 --> 05:18.985
CONCERNS THE RIGHT TO AN

05:19.052 --> 05:19.619
ABORTION, AND NOT THOSE OTHER

05:19.686 --> 05:21.054
ISSUES.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.221
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT

05:22.288 --> 05:23.690
LANGUAGE BY NO MEANS PRECLUDES

05:23.756 --> 05:25.525
THE COURT FROM ONE DAY DECIDING,

05:25.591 --> 05:26.292
"YOU KNOW WHAT, WE THINK IT DOES

05:26.359 --> 05:28.361
APPLY NOW!"

05:28.428 --> 05:30.396
AND BESIDES, WHAT KIND OF IDIOT

05:30.463 --> 05:31.864
WOULD EVEN PRETEND TO BELIEVE

05:31.931 --> 05:32.865
ANY REASSURANCES FROM THESE

05:32.932 --> 05:33.866
JUSTICES?

05:33.933 --> 05:34.367
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S SUSAN

05:34.434 --> 05:35.768
COLLINS.

05:35.835 --> 05:37.203
SUSAN COLLINS WOULD ABSOLUTELY

05:37.270 --> 05:39.439
BE THAT FUCKING IDIOT.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.473
[LAUGHTER]

05:40.540 --> 05:41.574
AND THE THING IS, EVEN IF WE

05:41.641 --> 05:43.042
DON'T GO DOWN THAT SLIPPERY

05:43.109 --> 05:43.576
SLOPE, THIS IS ALREADY BAD

05:43.643 --> 05:45.244
ENOUGH.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.279
BECAUSE WHAT THE SUPREME COURT

05:46.345 --> 05:46.913
HAS JUST DONE IS UTTERLY

05:46.979 --> 05:48.614
DEVASTATING.

05:48.681 --> 05:50.550
THE MESSAGE IT SENDS IS PRETTY

05:50.616 --> 05:51.517
CLEAR: "WE DON'T CARE IF

05:51.584 --> 05:53.519
PREGNANCY KILLS YOU.

05:53.586 --> 05:54.821
WE DON'T CARE IF YOU DON'T WANT

05:54.887 --> 05:55.988
TO BE PREGNANT.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.057
WE DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU AT ALL."

05:58.124 --> 05:59.158
AND FOR THOSE LIKE

05:59.225 --> 06:00.727
REPRESENTATIVE CORI BUSH, WHO'VE

06:00.793 --> 06:01.794
BEEN ABLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF

06:01.861 --> 06:03.763
ABORTION SERVICES IN THE PAST,

06:03.830 --> 06:05.798
AND KNOW HOW LIFE-CHANGING THEY

06:05.865 --> 06:07.233
CAN BE, IT IS HARD TO CONSIDER

06:07.300 --> 06:08.234
WHAT THE FUTURE NOW HOLDS FOR

06:08.301 --> 06:10.570
OTHERS IN THEIR POSITION.

06:10.636 --> 06:13.673
>> SO, I'M STANDING AT THE PLACE

06:13.740 --> 06:15.541
WHERE I HAD MY OWN ABORTION CARE

06:15.608 --> 06:17.009
SERVICES AT 18-YEARS-OLD.

06:17.076 --> 06:19.512
I GOT RAPED WHEN I WAS 17.

06:19.579 --> 06:20.680
AND I WAS ABLE TO BE BACK HERE

06:20.747 --> 06:21.347
WITH THE SECRETARY --

06:21.414 --> 06:22.582
>> THAT WAS HERE?

06:22.648 --> 06:23.649
>> HERE -- AS WE'RE TALKING,

06:23.716 --> 06:25.051
WE'RE SITTING WITH THE

06:25.118 --> 06:25.651
SECRETARY -- THAT ANNOUNCEMENT

06:25.718 --> 06:32.125
WAS MADE.

06:32.191 --> 06:34.193
IT -- IT BROKE MY HEART.

06:34.260 --> 06:38.865
BECAUSE I'M THINKING ABOUT THE

06:38.931 --> 06:39.665
PEOPLE WHO TODAY FOUND OUT THAT

06:39.732 --> 06:40.800
THEY WERE PREGNANT, WHO FOUND

06:40.867 --> 06:42.301
OUT THEY WERE PREGNANT A FEW

06:42.368 --> 06:43.169
WEEKS AGO, AND WERE TRYING TO

06:43.236 --> 06:44.070
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.

06:44.137 --> 06:44.937
TO RESTRICT PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO

06:45.004 --> 06:46.272
THEIR OWN BODY AND THEIR OWN

06:46.339 --> 06:46.873
DECISIONS, IT -- IT BROKE ME

06:46.939 --> 06:47.840
DOWN.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.475
I THINK ABOUT MY DAUGHTER WHO

06:49.542 --> 06:50.710
WILL NEVER -- WHO WILL NEVER

06:50.777 --> 06:53.346
KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN A

06:53.412 --> 06:54.847
A ROE V. WADE CONSTITUTIONALLY

06:54.914 --> 06:56.015
PROTECTED SOCIETY.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.216
>> John: YEAH.

06:57.283 --> 06:59.218
THIS IS GUTTING.

06:59.285 --> 07:00.486
THERE IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF

07:00.553 --> 07:02.255
UNDERSTANDABLE RAGE RIGHT NOW.

07:02.321 --> 07:03.589
AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY PLENTY

07:03.656 --> 07:04.557
OF INDIVIDUALS AND INSTITUTIONS

07:04.624 --> 07:06.159
WORTHY OF THAT ANGER.

07:06.225 --> 07:07.927
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE, MULTIPLE

07:07.994 --> 07:09.529
TIMES, ABOUT HOW EXACTLY WE GOT

07:09.595 --> 07:10.797
HERE: THE YEARS OF PLANNING BY

07:10.863 --> 07:12.031
ANTI-ABORTION FORCES, AND THE

07:12.098 --> 07:12.999
FAILURE OF DEMOCRATS TO

07:13.065 --> 07:13.566
EFFECTIVELY MOBILIZE TO STOP

07:13.633 --> 07:16.135
THEM.

07:16.202 --> 07:17.970
AND IT'S BEEN DISPIRITING TO SEE

07:18.037 --> 07:20.039
SO MANY DEMOCRATS THIS WEEK FAIL

07:20.106 --> 07:21.374
TO MEET THE MOMENT -- A MOMENT,

07:21.440 --> 07:22.542
BY THE WAY, THEY HAD NEARLY TWO

07:22.608 --> 07:25.011
MONTHS TO PLAN FOR.

07:25.077 --> 07:28.181
NANCY PELOSI READ A POEM, ONE

07:28.247 --> 07:28.815
REP TWEETED A PICTURE OF HIMSELF

07:28.881 --> 07:29.782
DOING YOGA, AND SO MANY

07:29.849 --> 07:31.450
DEMOCRATS SENT OUT REQUESTS FOR

07:31.517 --> 07:33.052
MONEY, REALLY FULFILLING THAT

07:33.119 --> 07:34.921
OLD DEMOCRATIC ADAGE, "WHEN THEY

07:34.987 --> 07:40.092
GO LOW, WE ASK YOU FOR $15."

07:40.159 --> 07:40.526
[LAUGHTER]

07:40.593 --> 07:41.694
ALL OF WHICH SEEMED COMPLETELY

07:41.761 --> 07:42.428
OUT OF TOUCH WITH HOW PEOPLE

07:42.495 --> 07:43.296
WERE FEELING.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.264
HONESTLY, A MUCH BETTER RESPONSE

07:45.331 --> 07:46.332
CAME FROM THE GATORS DAILY

07:46.399 --> 07:47.333
ACCOUNT, TWITTER'S NUMBER-ONE

07:47.400 --> 07:49.468
CROCODILIAN INFLUENCER, WHICH

07:49.535 --> 07:51.871
SIMPLY POSTED: "FUCK THE SUPREME

07:51.938 --> 07:53.139
COURT" AND THEN ADDED, "IF YOU

07:53.206 --> 07:53.773
DON'T AGREE, GET THE FUCK OFF MY

07:53.840 --> 07:55.374
PAGE.

07:55.441 --> 07:56.776
EVERY ALLIGATOR HATES YOU AND I

07:56.843 --> 07:58.477
HOPE YOUR FAMILY IS CURSED FOR

07:58.544 --> 07:59.378
SEVERAL GENERATIONS TO NEVER

07:59.445 --> 08:03.049
SEE AN ALLIGATOR AGAIN."

08:03.115 --> 08:03.316
[LAUGHTER]

08:03.382 --> 08:06.185
[APPLAUSE]

08:06.252 --> 08:07.486
THAT IS SOME STRONG MESSAGING!

08:07.553 --> 08:08.621
AND I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST ALL

08:08.688 --> 08:10.256
DEMOCRATS FELL SHORT.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.525
SOME, LIKE CORI BUSH AND AOC,

08:12.592 --> 08:13.759
SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT PEOPLE

08:13.826 --> 08:14.660
WERE GOING THROUGH, AS DID, BY

08:14.727 --> 08:17.096
THE WAY, THE MICHIGAN

08:17.163 --> 08:18.164
LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS,

08:18.231 --> 08:18.931
WHICH RELEASED A STATEMENT

08:18.998 --> 08:19.999
SAYING, AND I QUOTE, "THIS IS

08:20.066 --> 08:21.934
SOME BULLSHIT."

08:22.001 --> 08:24.871
WHICH IT ABSOLUTELY IS.

08:24.937 --> 08:25.671
AND I AM NOT SAYING THAT ALL I

08:25.738 --> 08:26.672
WANT FROM LEADERS IS SHOWS OF

08:26.739 --> 08:27.506
ANGER.

08:27.573 --> 08:28.841
BUT IT HAS BEEN DEPRESSING TO

08:28.908 --> 08:30.843
SEE SO MANY OF THEM TREAT THE

08:30.910 --> 08:32.411
END OF ROE V. WADE WITH THE

08:32.478 --> 08:34.146
SOLEMNITY OF A FUNERAL, INSTEAD

08:34.213 --> 08:34.747
OF THE URGENCY OF A FUCKING

08:34.814 --> 08:37.183
CARDIAC ARREST!

08:37.250 --> 08:38.918
AND THEY STAND IN STARK CONTRAST

08:38.985 --> 08:40.286
TO THE GROUPS ON THE GROUND

08:40.353 --> 08:41.454
WHO'VE BEEN DISPLAYING THAT

08:41.520 --> 08:43.489
URGENCY FOR YEARS NOW.

08:43.556 --> 08:45.291
THEY FOUGHT RELENTLESSLY AS

08:45.358 --> 08:46.359
ABORTION RIGHTS HAVE BEEN

08:46.425 --> 08:47.460
CHIPPED AWAY ALL OVER THE

08:47.526 --> 08:49.095
COUNTRY, AND THEY HAVE WORKED

08:49.161 --> 08:50.863
TIRELESSLY TO FIND WAYS AROUND

08:50.930 --> 08:51.898
EACH RESTRICTION, AND PROVIDE

08:51.964 --> 08:53.366
HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR THOSE

08:53.432 --> 08:54.533
WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED THEM, EVEN

08:54.600 --> 08:57.637
WHEN IT WAS VERY HARD.

08:57.703 --> 08:59.272
VOLUNTEERS WALKED PEOPLE INTO

08:59.338 --> 09:00.439
CLINICS, AND DOCTORS FLEW IN TO

09:00.506 --> 09:02.241
PROVIDE PROCEDURES.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.576
ABORTION ADVOCATES DID ALL OF

09:03.643 --> 09:05.978
THIS, EVEN AS THEY WERE BEING

09:06.045 --> 09:07.246
YELLED AT FROM ONE SIDE, AND

09:07.313 --> 09:08.748
TOLD THAT THEY WERE OVERREACTING

09:08.814 --> 09:10.349
BY THE OTHER.

09:10.416 --> 09:11.651
AND THEIR UNFLINCHING COMMITMENT

09:11.717 --> 09:13.085
AND COMPASSION IS SOMETHING WE

09:13.152 --> 09:14.053
ARE ALL GOING TO NEED TO FIND

09:14.120 --> 09:16.055
WAYS TO EMULATE GOING FORWARD,

09:16.122 --> 09:17.924
BOTH ON AN INDIVIDUAL LEVEL, AS

09:17.990 --> 09:20.026
WE HELP ONE ANOTHER NAVIGATE THE

09:20.092 --> 09:21.594
NIGHTMARISH MAZE THAT BASIC

09:21.661 --> 09:23.362
HEALTH CARE IS ABOUT TO BECOME.

09:23.429 --> 09:25.231
AND HOPEFULLY, EVENTUALLY, ON AN

09:25.298 --> 09:26.732
INSTITUTIONAL ONE, IF THOSE IN

09:26.799 --> 09:27.833
POWER CAN DEMONSTRATE ENOUGH

09:27.900 --> 09:30.903
COMMITMENT TO THIS FIGHT.

09:30.970 --> 09:32.104
LOOK, TIME WILL TELL WHAT THIS

09:32.171 --> 09:34.273
WEEK ACTUALLY WAS.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.075
IF IT WAS A PERMANENT SETBACK, A

09:36.142 --> 09:43.149
WAYSTATION ALONG A FURTHER

09:43.215 --> 09:48.054
DESCENT INTO HELL.

09:48.120 --> 09:48.955
OR IF IT GALVANIZED A MOVEMENT

09:49.021 --> 09:49.689
THAT EVENTUALLY WON BACK

09:49.755 --> 09:50.656
EVERYTHING THAT WE JUST LOST.

09:50.723 --> 09:51.824
BUT THE ONLY THING I KNOW FOR

09:51.891 --> 09:52.558
SURE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THIS WEEK

09:52.625 --> 09:53.392
WAS HEARTBREAKING, IT WAS

09:53.459 --> 09:54.393
ENRAGING, IT WAS A SUPREME

09:54.460 --> 09:55.227
INJUSTICE, AND IT WAS, IF I MAY

09:55.294 --> 09:56.595
QUOTE THE MICHIGAN LEGISLATIVE

09:56.662 --> 09:57.830
BLACK CAUCUS, "SOME ABSOLUTE

09:57.897 --> 09:59.432
BULLSHIT."

09:59.498 --> 10:01.767
AND NOW THIS.

10:01.834 --> 10:02.902
[APPLAUSE]

10:02.969 --> 10:04.203
>> Announcer: AND NOW, IN THE

10:04.270 --> 10:05.838
INTEREST OF GIVING YOU SOMETHING

10:05.905 --> 10:07.740
VERY STUPID: BETTER NAMES FOR

10:07.807 --> 10:09.108
THE DOGS FROM THIS YEAR'S

10:09.175 --> 10:12.611
WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.981
HAMBURGER.

10:15.047 --> 10:17.216
WORM.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.685

WEIRD PHIL.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.636
SNACKS.

10:37.703 --> 10:39.772
THE OLD WORLD IS DYING AND THE

10:39.839 --> 10:41.640
NEW WORLD STRUGGLES TO BE BORN,

10:41.707 --> 10:43.909
NOW IS THE TIME OF MONSTERS.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.448

MTV'S "RIDICULOUSNESS."

10:53.119 --> 10:57.390
AND, TODD.

10:57.456 --> 10:57.656
[LAUGHTER]

10:57.723 --> 10:59.258
[APPLAUSE]

10:59.325 --> 11:01.127
>> John: MOVING ON.

11:01.193 --> 11:01.761
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

11:01.827 --> 11:03.295
WATER.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.797
IT'S NOT JUST THE ONE THING YOUR

11:04.864 --> 11:06.132
HOUSEPLANT NEEDED THAT YOU

11:06.198 --> 11:07.266
COULDN'T EVEN PROVIDE, IT'S ALSO

11:07.333 --> 11:08.701
THE ENGINE THAT ONCE POWERED

11:08.768 --> 11:10.169
THIS CLASSIC TOY.

11:10.236 --> 11:12.004
>> WHAT'S THIS CRAZY THING?

11:12.071 --> 11:12.805
WHY, IT'S THE WHAM-O WATER

11:12.872 --> 11:13.873
WIGGLE.

11:13.939 --> 11:15.041
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE

11:15.107 --> 11:18.844
IT!

11:18.911 --> 11:19.478
JUST HOOK UP TO A HOSE AND LOOK,

11:19.545 --> 11:20.413
A NEW FUN GAME!

11:20.479 --> 11:21.547
IT'S PRACTICALLY ALIVE!

11:21.614 --> 11:23.749
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THE WATER

11:23.816 --> 11:27.253
WIGGLE WILL DO NEXT.

11:27.319 --> 11:28.087
>> John: YES, THE WATER WIGGLE!

11:28.154 --> 11:28.721
YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT IT WILL DO

11:28.788 --> 11:29.522
NEXT!

11:29.588 --> 11:30.389
EXCEPT KILL SOME PEOPLE.

11:30.456 --> 11:30.990
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE WATER

11:31.057 --> 11:32.091
WIGGLE DID.

11:32.158 --> 11:32.725
IT KILLED MULTIPLE PEOPLE AND IT

11:32.792 --> 11:33.426
WAS RECALLED.

11:33.492 --> 11:34.927
THAT'S RIGHT, WE'RE LESS THAN

11:34.994 --> 11:35.828
TWO MINUTES INTO THE PIECE AND

11:35.895 --> 11:37.029
I'VE ALREADY HIT YOU WITH A

11:37.096 --> 11:38.697
TRADEMARK JOHN OLIVER SAD FACT.

11:38.764 --> 11:41.300
>> SAD FACT!

11:41.367 --> 11:43.235
[LAUGHTER]

11:43.302 --> 11:44.670
>> John: WATER IS OBVIOUSLY

11:44.737 --> 11:46.105
VITAL TO ALL LIFE ON EARTH.

11:46.172 --> 11:47.373
OUR BODIES ARE ESSENTIALLY BAGS

11:47.440 --> 11:47.973
OF BONES AND MEAT SUSPENDED IN

11:48.040 --> 11:49.708
WATER.

11:49.775 --> 11:52.845
BUT ALREADY, 3.6 BILLION PEOPLE,

11:52.912 --> 11:53.345
NEARLY HALF THE WORLD'S

11:53.412 --> 11:54.880
POPULATION, LIVE IN AREAS THAT

11:54.947 --> 11:55.481
SUFFER WATER SCARCITY AT LEAST

11:55.548 --> 11:57.383
ONE MONTH EACH YEAR.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.818
AND WHILE THIS IS CLEARLY

11:58.884 --> 12:00.486
BECOMING A PROBLEM EVERYWHERE,

12:00.553 --> 12:01.854
TONIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

12:01.921 --> 12:03.522
THE AMERICAN WEST, WHERE THE

12:03.589 --> 12:04.390
LAST SEVERAL DECADES HAVE SEEN A

12:04.457 --> 12:06.092
RECORD-BREAKING DROUGHT.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.493
THE SOUTHWEST IS ACTUALLY GOING

12:07.560 --> 12:09.728
THROUGH ITS DRIEST 22-YEAR

12:09.795 --> 12:13.833
PERIOD SINCE 800 A.D.!

12:13.899 --> 12:15.434
THAT IS AS FAR BACK AS THE DATA

12:15.501 --> 12:16.769
GOES, WHICH IS PRETTY STARTLING,

12:16.836 --> 12:17.736
PARTLY BECAUSE I CAN'T BELIEVE

12:17.803 --> 12:18.704
SOMEONE BACK THEN WAS EVEN

12:18.771 --> 12:20.806
KEEPING DROUGHT RECORDS.

12:20.873 --> 12:22.241
IT WAS PROBABLY THE 9TH CENTURY

12:22.308 --> 12:23.442
VERSION OF ME: SOME LANKY,

12:23.509 --> 12:24.977
NEAR-SIGHTED DWEEB WHO SQUEALED,

12:25.044 --> 12:26.145
"I'LL BE THE OFFICIAL DROUGHT

12:26.212 --> 12:27.213
DADDY!

12:27.279 --> 12:29.582
I'LL COUNT THE WETS!"

12:29.648 --> 12:30.749
[LAUGHTER]

12:30.816 --> 12:33.352
AND THIS DROUGHT HAS HAD MASSIVE

12:33.419 --> 12:34.753
IMPACT ON THE COLORADO RIVER,

12:34.820 --> 12:35.354
IN PARTICULAR, WHICH IS A KEY

12:35.421 --> 12:36.655
SOURCE OF WATER FOR MOST OF THE

12:36.722 --> 12:39.492
SOUTHWESTERN STATES.

12:39.558 --> 12:41.260
>> 22 YEARS OF DROUGHT, COMBINED

12:41.327 --> 12:42.862
WITH EXPLODING POPULATIONS IN

12:42.928 --> 12:43.863
COLORADO AND THROUGHOUT THE

12:43.929 --> 12:46.132
SOUTHWEST, HAVE LED TO

12:46.198 --> 12:47.867
RECORD-LOW LEVELS AT BOTH LAKE

12:47.933 --> 12:50.102
POWELL IN UTAH AND LAKE MEAD

12:50.169 --> 12:52.071
OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS, WHERE AN

12:52.138 --> 12:54.406
EXPANDING WHITE RING OF MINERAL

12:54.473 --> 12:57.109
DEPOSITS IS PROBABLY THE MOST

12:57.176 --> 12:58.043
VISUAL EVIDENCE OF THE RIVER'S

12:58.110 --> 12:59.211
DECLINE.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.213
>> IT'S DIRE.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.048
THE SITUATION ALONG THE COLORADO

13:03.115 --> 13:04.884
RIVER IS DIRE, AND I'M NOT SURE

13:04.950 --> 13:06.252
IT'S GOING TO GET BETTER, EVER.

13:06.318 --> 13:08.554
>> John: WOW.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.022
THAT IS A BLEAK THING TO HEAR AN

13:10.089 --> 13:11.290
ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERT SAY.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.358
BUT THEN, THE NEWS HERE IS

13:12.424 --> 13:14.426
BLEAK.

13:14.493 --> 13:16.028
WATER LEVELS IN LAKE MEAD HAVE

13:16.095 --> 13:22.968
NOW FALLEN SO MUCH THAT YOU MAY

13:23.035 --> 13:27.039
HAVE SEEN: AUTHORITIES HAVE

13:27.106 --> 13:27.973
FOUND HUMAN REMAINS THERE,

13:28.040 --> 13:29.875
TWICE, IN JUST ONE WEEK.

13:29.942 --> 13:31.177
WHICH REALLY FREAKED ME OUT,

13:31.243 --> 13:33.412
UNTIL I REMEMBERED THAT I DUMPED

13:33.479 --> 13:34.046
THAT HITCHHIKER IN LAKE MOJAVE,

13:34.113 --> 13:34.647
NOT LAKE MEAD.

13:34.713 --> 13:37.283
SO, I'M GOOD.

13:37.349 --> 13:37.550
[LAUGHTER]

13:37.616 --> 13:38.450
AND WHILE YOU'D LIKE TO THINK A

13:38.517 --> 13:39.585
SITUATION THIS DIRE WOULD CAUSE

13:39.652 --> 13:40.219
PEOPLE TO BE MORE MINDFUL OF OUR

13:40.286 --> 13:41.453
WATER USAGE, INSTEAD, WE'RE

13:41.520 --> 13:42.054
SEEING STORIES LIKE THIS.

13:42.121 --> 13:43.189
>> RIGHT NOW, IT'S AN EMPTY PLOT

13:43.255 --> 13:44.423
OF LAND COVERED WITH BRUSH.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.624
BUT IF DEVELOPER REGENT

13:45.691 --> 13:46.559
PROPERTIES GETS THE GO-AHEAD,

13:46.625 --> 13:47.960
THE OPEN DESERT WILL BE

13:48.027 --> 13:49.195
TRANSFORMED INTO THIS, THE

13:49.261 --> 13:51.030
$750 MILLION THERMAL BEACH CLUB.

13:51.096 --> 13:52.565
UNDER THE CURRENT PLAN, THE

13:52.631 --> 13:54.266
DEVELOPER WANTS TO BUILD 326

13:54.333 --> 13:56.302
LUXURY HOMES HERE AT THE SITE,

13:56.368 --> 13:56.969
ALL SURROUNDING A 20-ACRE

13:57.036 --> 13:59.638
SURFING LAGOON.

13:59.705 --> 14:01.774
>> John: THAT'S RIGHT: A 20-ACRE

14:01.840 --> 14:03.576
SURFING LAGOON IN THE MIDDLE OF

14:03.642 --> 14:04.710
THE CALIFORNIA DESERT, ONE OF AT

14:04.777 --> 14:05.878
LEAST FOUR NEW SURF LAGOONS

14:05.945 --> 14:07.379
PROPOSED OUT THERE.

14:07.446 --> 14:08.214
THAT IS JUST MONUMENTALLY

14:08.280 --> 14:10.516
STUPID.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.116
I'M SURPRISED THEY DIDN'T GO

14:11.183 --> 14:12.218
EVEN FURTHER.

14:12.284 --> 14:13.586
"NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE SURFING

14:13.652 --> 14:15.154
LAGOONS, WE ALSO HAVE A WALL OF

14:15.221 --> 14:16.855
CONSTANTLY FLUSHING TOILETS, A

14:16.922 --> 14:18.224
HOSE THAT RUNS ALL DAY IN THE

14:18.290 --> 14:19.558
MIDDLE OF A CONCRETE PARKING

14:19.625 --> 14:22.561
LOT, AND OF COURSE, WET FRANK, A

14:22.628 --> 14:23.195
MAN WE PAY TO DUMP BUCKETS OF

14:23.262 --> 14:24.163
WATER ON HIMSELF ALL DAY."

14:24.230 --> 14:25.898
KEEP IT UP, FRANK!

14:25.965 --> 14:28.334
WE STAN A DAMP LEGEND!

14:28.400 --> 14:29.602
[LAUGHTER]

14:29.668 --> 14:31.136
AND WHILE DEVELOPMENT LIKE THAT

14:31.203 --> 14:32.071
IS OBVIOUSLY NOT IDEAL, IT IS

14:32.137 --> 14:33.505
DEPRESSINGLY CONSISTENT WITH OUR

14:33.572 --> 14:35.107
APPROACH TO WATER OUT WEST,

14:35.174 --> 14:36.642
BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A HISTORY OF

14:36.709 --> 14:37.743
DENIAL AND WISHFUL THINKING,

14:37.810 --> 14:40.012
ESPECIALLY AROUND THE COLORADO

14:40.079 --> 14:40.913
RIVER, THAT IS NOW CRASHING INTO

14:40.980 --> 14:42.915
HARSH REALITY.

14:42.982 --> 14:44.717
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

14:44.783 --> 14:46.252
OUR WATER SHORTAGE, HOW IT'S

14:46.318 --> 14:47.987
BEEN IMPACTED BY THE CHOICES

14:48.053 --> 14:48.921
WE'VE MADE, AND WHAT WE CAN DO

14:48.988 --> 14:50.089
ABOUT IT.

14:50.155 --> 14:51.457
AND LET'S START WITH HOW THE

14:51.523 --> 14:54.193
COLORADO RIVER IS MANAGED.

14:54.260 --> 14:55.594
BECAUSE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WE'RE

14:55.661 --> 14:56.662
SEEING TODAY CAN BE TRACED BACK

14:56.729 --> 14:57.463
TO DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE A

14:57.529 --> 14:58.998
CENTURY AGO.

14:59.064 --> 15:01.100
>> THIS PRECIOUS RESOURCE IS

15:01.166 --> 15:03.535
ALLOCATED BASED ON A 1922

15:03.602 --> 15:04.270
AGREEMENT CALLED THE COLORADO

15:04.336 --> 15:06.538
RIVER COMPACT.

15:06.605 --> 15:08.340
ONCE THE RIVER BASIN STATES

15:08.407 --> 15:09.942
AGREED ON THEIR FAIR SHARES,

15:10.009 --> 15:12.311
THEY EACH ESTABLISHED A

15:12.378 --> 15:13.646
SENIORITY SYSTEM, FIRST IN TIME,

15:13.712 --> 15:16.749
FIRST IN RIGHT.

15:16.815 --> 15:17.850
>> John: IT'S TRUE: SEVEN STATES

15:17.916 --> 15:19.318
GOT TOGETHER AND CARVED UP ALL

15:19.385 --> 15:21.487
THE WATER IN THE RIVER,

15:21.553 --> 15:22.087
ESSENTIALLY LETTING PEOPLE LAY

15:22.154 --> 15:22.888
CLAIM TO IT THROUGH A COMPLEX

15:22.955 --> 15:25.291
SYSTEM OF CALLING DIBS.

15:25.357 --> 15:26.058
AND LOOK, I'VE GOT NO PROBLEM

15:26.125 --> 15:27.259
WITH "DIBS" IN PRINCIPLE.

15:27.326 --> 15:27.926
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO FIGURE OUT

15:27.993 --> 15:29.795
WHO GETS THE LAST SLICE OF

15:29.862 --> 15:31.463
PIZZA, OR THE PINK STARBUSTS, OR

15:31.530 --> 15:34.033
THE CUTEST BABY AT THE HOSPITAL.

15:34.099 --> 15:34.833
[LAUGHTER]

15:34.900 --> 15:36.135
I DON'T CARE IF YOU GAVE BIRTH

15:36.201 --> 15:37.136
TO HER, I CALLED DIBS!

15:37.202 --> 15:39.204
THAT ONE IS MINE!

15:39.271 --> 15:40.439
BUT IT IS A WEIRD WAY TO DIVIDE

15:40.506 --> 15:41.273
UP SOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS

15:41.340 --> 15:41.907
WATER.

15:41.974 --> 15:43.575
THE COLORADO RIVER COMPACT

15:43.642 --> 15:45.010
SERVES AS THE FOUNDATION FOR

15:45.077 --> 15:45.644
WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE "LAW OF THE

15:45.711 --> 15:46.879
RIVER."

15:46.945 --> 15:48.514
WHICH SOUNDS LESS LIKE A SET OF

15:48.580 --> 15:50.082
WATER MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS AND

15:50.149 --> 15:51.450
MORE LIKE AN ANIMATED BUDDY COP

15:51.517 --> 15:53.485
MOVIE STARRING A TROUT AND A

15:53.552 --> 15:57.089
BEAR, VOICED BY TWO ACTORS WHO

15:57.156 --> 15:58.891
ARE BOTH WILDLY ANTISEMITIC.

15:58.957 --> 16:00.025
BUT THERE WERE A FEW MAJOR

16:00.092 --> 16:00.859
PROBLEMS WITH HOW THE COMPACT

16:00.926 --> 16:01.694
WAS SET UP, RIGHT FROM THE

16:01.760 --> 16:02.828
START.

16:02.895 --> 16:05.564
FIRST, MEXICO WASN'T INCLUDED,

16:05.631 --> 16:06.598
AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS TODAY, THE

16:06.665 --> 16:07.199
RIVER ESSENTIALLY RUNS DRY BY

16:07.266 --> 16:08.300
THE TIME IT GETS ACROSS THE

16:08.367 --> 16:09.335
BORDER.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.669
AND THE COMPACT ALSO DIDN'T

16:10.736 --> 16:11.637
SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE WATER

16:11.704 --> 16:13.038
NEEDS OF THE MORE THAN TWO DOZEN

16:13.105 --> 16:14.106
NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES WHO

16:14.173 --> 16:16.008
DEPEND ON THE RIVER.

16:16.075 --> 16:17.676
WHICH IS PRETTY SHITTY,

16:17.743 --> 16:19.545
ESPECIALLY AS THOSE TRIBES DO

16:19.611 --> 16:21.347
HAVE THE MOST SENIOR WATER

16:21.413 --> 16:22.681
RIGHTS, GIVEN THEY WERE, IN A

16:22.748 --> 16:25.250
VERY REAL SENSE, HERE FIRST.

16:25.317 --> 16:28.287
THEY HAVE THE ULTIMATE DIBS.

16:28.354 --> 16:29.288
BUT EVEN SO, MANY TRIBES HAVE

16:29.355 --> 16:30.789
HAD TO STRUGGLE TO GET THOSE

16:30.856 --> 16:32.157
WATER RIGHTS ACTUALLY QUANTIFIED

16:32.224 --> 16:33.826
ON PAPER, AND EVEN THEN, TO GET

16:33.892 --> 16:34.460
THE INFRASTRUCTURE THEY NEED IN

16:34.526 --> 16:36.428
ORDER TO ACCESS IT.

16:36.495 --> 16:37.596
AND FOR MANY TRIBES, THOSE

16:37.663 --> 16:39.631
FIGHTS ARE STILL HAPPENING.

16:39.698 --> 16:40.933
BUT IT WASN'T JUST ABOUT WHO THE

16:40.999 --> 16:43.335
COMPACT LEFT OUT.

16:43.402 --> 16:44.503
ANOTHER KEY FLAW WAS THAT, RIGHT

16:44.570 --> 16:46.305
FROM THE START, IT ALLOCATED

16:46.372 --> 16:46.839
MORE WATER THAN ACTUALLY

16:46.905 --> 16:48.474
EXISTED.

16:48.540 --> 16:49.942
WATER SUPPLIES ARE MEASURED IN

16:50.008 --> 16:51.677
ACRE-FEET, AND THE COMPACT

16:51.744 --> 16:53.812
DIVIDED UP RIGHTS TO 15 MILLION

16:53.879 --> 16:55.681
ACRE FEET OF WATER, EVEN THOUGH

16:55.748 --> 16:57.816
THE RIVER ONLY CARRIES AROUND 12

16:57.883 --> 16:59.818
TO 13 MILLION.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.053
AND TO BE CLEAR, THEY KNEW THIS

17:01.120 --> 17:06.358
WAS A PROBLEM AT THE TIME.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.527
THE EXPLORER AND SCIENTIST JOHN

17:08.594 --> 17:10.262
WESLEY POWELL WARNED IN 1893,

17:10.329 --> 17:11.597
"THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT WATER

17:11.663 --> 17:12.965
TO SUPPLY THESE LANDS."

17:13.031 --> 17:13.766
BUT THE BULLSHIT MATH NEVER

17:13.832 --> 17:14.933
STOPPED.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.135
JUST TEN YEARS AGO, IN A MAJOR

17:16.201 --> 17:17.936
STUDY BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,

17:18.003 --> 17:19.772
STATES FORCED THE MODELERS TO

17:19.838 --> 17:22.608
ADD SO-CALLED "MAGIC WATER,"

17:22.674 --> 17:24.209
EXTRA WATER THAT EXISTED IN THE

17:24.276 --> 17:25.811
COMPUTER MODEL ONLY, WHICH IS

17:25.878 --> 17:28.981
JUST ABSURD!

17:29.048 --> 17:30.115
AND NOT ONLY BECAUSE "MAGIC

17:30.182 --> 17:31.583
WATER" SOUNDS LIKE A EUPHEMISM

17:31.650 --> 17:32.184
FOR URINE USED EXCLUSIVELY BY

17:32.251 --> 17:33.185
BJORK.

17:33.252 --> 17:37.623
"IT'S ME, BJORK.

17:37.689 --> 17:38.190
SOMETIMES I HAVE TO MAKE THE

17:38.257 --> 17:38.924
MAGIC WATER.

17:38.991 --> 17:41.093
[GIGGLES]

17:41.160 --> 17:41.727
BUT IT TAKES FOREVER TO GET OUT

17:41.794 --> 17:43.929
OF THIS SWAN!"

17:43.996 --> 17:45.330
[LAUGHTER]

17:45.397 --> 17:46.432
AND I DO GET WHY STATES MIGHT

17:46.498 --> 17:47.733
WANT TO PRETEND THERE'S MORE

17:47.800 --> 17:49.101
WATER THAN THERE IS: BECAUSE

17:49.168 --> 17:50.035
THEY WANT CONTINUED GROWTH AND

17:50.102 --> 17:50.969
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

17:51.036 --> 17:52.404
AND NOBODY WANTS TO BE THE BAD

17:52.471 --> 17:53.372
GUY POINTING OUT THE FUNDAMENTAL

17:53.439 --> 17:55.407
PROBLEM WITH THAT.

17:55.474 --> 17:56.775
JUST LISTEN TO A REPORTER

17:56.842 --> 17:57.810
PRESSING A REPRESENTATIVE OF

17:57.876 --> 17:59.077
SOUTHERN NEVADA'S WATER

17:59.144 --> 18:00.712
AUTHORITY ON HOW THEY CAN

18:00.779 --> 18:01.814
JUSTIFY GROWTH IN THE FACE OF

18:01.880 --> 18:03.582
LOOMING WATER SCARCITY.

18:03.649 --> 18:05.250
>> BUT SOMETHING'S GOT TO GIVE.

18:05.317 --> 18:06.819
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP

18:06.885 --> 18:07.886
EXPANDING THE POPULATION SIZE

18:07.953 --> 18:10.122
WITH A DWINDLING WATER SUPPLY.

18:10.189 --> 18:10.622
I MEAN, THAT'S JUST NOT

18:10.689 --> 18:11.957
SUSTAINABLE.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.392
>> THAT'S JUST HUMAN NATURE.

18:13.459 --> 18:14.460
I MEAN, THAT REALLY KIND OF GOES

18:14.526 --> 18:16.061
BACK TO MANIFEST DESTINY.

18:16.128 --> 18:16.962
IT GOES BACK TO, SORT OF, THIS

18:17.029 --> 18:18.363
AMERICAN DREAM.

18:18.430 --> 18:19.898
YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO SEE

18:19.965 --> 18:20.566
PEOPLE MOVING TO THE DESERT

18:20.632 --> 18:22.334
SOUTHWEST.

18:22.401 --> 18:23.802
SO, FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS

18:23.869 --> 18:25.537
WATER MANAGERS, IT IS UP TO US

18:25.604 --> 18:26.538
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO

18:26.605 --> 18:27.706
MEET THE DEMANDS OF OUR

18:27.773 --> 18:29.374
COMMUNITY, REGARDLESS OF WHAT

18:29.441 --> 18:31.977
OUR NUMBERS MIGHT BE.

18:32.044 --> 18:33.679
>> John: OKAY, SO THERE'S A LOT

18:33.745 --> 18:38.016
THERE, INCLUDING THE PHRASE

18:38.083 --> 18:39.051
"MANIFEST DESTINY," WHICH AS WE

18:39.117 --> 18:39.852
ALL KNOW, ONLY HAS GOOD

18:39.918 --> 18:41.987
CONNOTATIONS.

18:42.054 --> 18:43.522
[LAUGHTER]

18:43.589 --> 18:45.090
LIKE "A SELF-PUBLISHED BOOK

18:45.157 --> 18:45.924
ABOUT MY STRUGGLE," OR "I REALLY

18:45.991 --> 18:47.059
WANT TO IMPRESS JODIE FOSTER,"

18:47.125 --> 18:50.062
OR "HELLO, MY NAME IS TED CRUZ."

18:50.128 --> 18:52.097
[LAUGHTER]

18:52.164 --> 18:53.565
NO RED FLAGS THERE AT ALL.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.633
BUT AGAIN, YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

18:54.700 --> 18:55.567
WHY HE FEELS THE NEED TO RESPOND

18:55.634 --> 18:56.235
THAT WAY.

18:56.301 --> 18:57.769
NOBODY WANTS TO BE THE ONE

18:57.836 --> 19:02.241
HAVING TO DELIVER BAD NEWS.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.308
BUT THE IMMOVABLE FACT IS

19:03.375 --> 19:04.643
CITIES IN THE DESERT CAN'T GROW

19:04.710 --> 19:05.511
WITHOUT LIMIT, AND HARD

19:05.577 --> 19:06.612
SACRIFICES WILL HAVE TO BE MADE.

19:06.678 --> 19:07.513
WHICH BRINGS US TO ANOTHER

19:07.579 --> 19:08.514
FUNDAMENTAL TENSION HERE,

19:08.580 --> 19:09.481
SPECIFICALLY BETWEEN FARMERS AND

19:09.548 --> 19:10.849
CITIES.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.351
BECAUSE FARMERS AND RANCHERS

19:12.417 --> 19:13.785
WERE OUT WEST MUCH EARLIER THAN

19:13.852 --> 19:15.420
MOST AMERICAN CITIES WERE

19:15.487 --> 19:17.122
ESTABLISHED, MEANING THEY HAVE

19:17.189 --> 19:18.090
SENIOR WATER RIGHTS, AND THEY

19:18.156 --> 19:19.925
USE THEM.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.960
AGRICULTURE USES ABOUT 70% OF

19:22.027 --> 19:24.963
THE COLORADO RIVER WATER.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.065
AND OBVIOUSLY, AGRICULTURE NEEDS

19:27.132 --> 19:27.766
WATER, AND NO ONE WANTS A

19:27.833 --> 19:28.367
SITUATION WHERE WE CREATE FOOD

19:28.433 --> 19:30.269
SHORTAGES.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.570
BUT IT'S WORTH KNOWING: IN SOME

19:31.637 --> 19:33.672
PLACES, FARMERS ARE INCENTIVIZED

19:33.739 --> 19:36.275
TO USE THEIR ALLOCATION TO A

19:36.341 --> 19:36.808
TRULY NONSENSICAL DEGREE.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.277
MANY STATES ALONG THE RIVER HAVE

19:38.343 --> 19:40.145
RULES PROMISING TO CONFISCATE

19:40.212 --> 19:41.613
WATER RIGHTS IF WATER USERS

19:41.680 --> 19:43.549
DON'T MAXIMIZE THEIR USE.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.484
BASICALLY, USE IT OR LOSE IT.

19:45.551 --> 19:46.118
AND THAT HAS INGRAINED CERTAIN

19:46.184 --> 19:47.519
HABITS.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.922
JUST LISTEN TO THIS FARMER IN

19:49.988 --> 19:51.924
ARIZONA EXPLAINING WHY HE CHOSE

19:51.990 --> 19:52.791
TO GROW A PARTICULARLY

19:52.858 --> 19:54.493
WATER-INTENSIVE CROP.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.928
>> I'VE JUST BEEN FARMING IT,

19:55.994 --> 19:59.398
THIS ALFALFA.

19:59.464 --> 20:01.600
YOU GOT TO KEEP FARMING IT TO

20:01.667 --> 20:02.701
KEEP THE WATER, AND THAT'S WHY I

20:02.768 --> 20:04.169
WAS MAINLY DOING IT, WAS TO HANG

20:04.236 --> 20:07.172
ON TO THE WATER.

20:07.239 --> 20:09.841
>> John: OKAY, FIRST, I DON'T

20:09.908 --> 20:11.209
KNOW WHO WAS FILMING HIM THERE

20:11.276 --> 20:11.810
BUT THAT CAMERA IS SIMPLY TOO

20:11.877 --> 20:12.377
CLOSE.

20:12.444 --> 20:13.378
BACK UP AND GIVE THAT MAN SOME

20:13.445 --> 20:15.013
SPACE!

20:15.080 --> 20:15.814
[LAUGHTER]

20:15.881 --> 20:19.117
THAT IS JUST TOO MUCH FACE.

20:19.184 --> 20:20.319
BUT SECOND, HE FARMED ALFALFA

20:20.385 --> 20:21.486
JUST SO HE COULD HOLD ONTO HIS

20:21.553 --> 20:22.120
WATER RIGHTS, WHICH FEELS

20:22.187 --> 20:23.155
RIDICULOUS.

20:23.221 --> 20:24.423
THE ONLY MORE ABSURD WAY HE

20:24.489 --> 20:26.191
COULD'VE USED WATER IN THAT

20:26.258 --> 20:26.959
FIELD IS IF HE'D ALSO PLANTED

20:27.025 --> 20:29.928
WET FRANK.

20:29.995 --> 20:30.896
[LAUGHTER]

20:30.963 --> 20:31.930
GREAT WORK, FRANK!

20:31.997 --> 20:33.932
THE SOGGY PRINCE DID IT AGAIN.

20:33.999 --> 20:35.467
SO FOR ALL THOSE REASONS, MANY

20:35.534 --> 20:37.202
RELATED TO THE COMPACT'S

20:37.269 --> 20:38.870
ORIGINAL OVERALLOCATION, THE

20:38.937 --> 20:42.708
COLORADO RIVER IS SHRINKING.

20:42.774 --> 20:43.709
BUT WHAT THAT IS LEADING TO IS

20:43.775 --> 20:45.310
WATER USERS INCREASINGLY TURNING

20:45.377 --> 20:45.811
TO ANOTHER MAJOR SOURCE:

20:45.877 --> 20:49.514
GROUNDWATER.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.415
GROUNDWATER IS EXACTLY WHAT IT

20:50.482 --> 20:51.350
SOUNDS LIKE: WATER UNDER THE

20:51.416 --> 20:52.551
GROUND.

20:52.618 --> 20:53.885
IT SLOWLY COLLECTS IN AQUIFERS

20:53.952 --> 20:55.520
BENEATH THE EARTH'S SURFACE,

20:55.587 --> 20:56.455
ACCUMULATING WHEN RAIN,

20:56.521 --> 20:57.656
SNOWMELT, AND OTHER NATURAL

20:57.723 --> 20:58.323
WATER SOURCES SEEP INTO THE

20:58.390 --> 20:59.958
GROUND.

21:00.025 --> 21:01.893
BUT IMPORTANTLY, SOME OF THESE

21:01.960 --> 21:03.462
AQUIFERS TOOK THOUSANDS, IF NOT

21:03.528 --> 21:05.364
MILLIONS OF YEARS TO FILL.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.199
SO IF WE PUMP THEM DRY, THEY'RE

21:07.265 --> 21:09.134
NOT COMING BACK ANYTIME SOON.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.636
BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS REFLECTED

21:10.702 --> 21:11.837
IN OUR POLICIES.

21:11.903 --> 21:14.306
TAKE ARIZONA, FOR INSTANCE.

21:14.373 --> 21:16.241
IN 80% OF THE STATE, THERE ARE

21:16.308 --> 21:17.342
NO LAWS PROTECTING HOW MUCH

21:17.409 --> 21:19.945
WATER IS TAKEN FROM THE GROUND.

21:20.012 --> 21:21.179
AND WHEN YOU HAVE NO LIMITS, IT

21:21.246 --> 21:21.813
IS, UNSURPRISINGLY, A

21:21.880 --> 21:23.715
FREE-FOR-ALL.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.117
>> OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS,

21:25.183 --> 21:26.251
FARMLANDS HAVE INCREASED BY

21:26.318 --> 21:29.154
ALMOST A THIRD IN ARIZONA.

21:29.221 --> 21:31.523
THE NUMBER OF WELLS HAS RISEN

21:31.590 --> 21:34.359
FROM 43 TO 123 IN WILLCOX ALONE.

21:34.426 --> 21:36.061
ALL THEY HAVE TO DO IS BUY THE

21:36.128 --> 21:37.062
LAND TO HAVE ACCESS TO AS MUCH

21:37.129 --> 21:40.165
FREE WATER AS THEY WANT.

21:40.232 --> 21:40.832
>> IN THIS AREA, THERE'S NO

21:40.899 --> 21:43.969
RULE.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.204
>> SO, YOUR CLIENT CAN PUMP AS

21:46.271 --> 21:48.540
MUCH WATER THEY WANT?

21:48.607 --> 21:51.243
>> THEY COULD DRILL A WELL EVERY

21:51.309 --> 21:51.843
10 FOOT ALL AROUND THIS PLACE.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.045
NO LIMIT.

21:53.111 --> 21:54.046
>> John: YEAH, THAT'S NOT GREAT,

21:54.112 --> 21:55.180
IS IT?

21:55.247 --> 21:56.181
PARTLY BECAUSE DRILLING THAT

21:56.248 --> 21:57.549
MANY WELLS MEANS THEY'RE GOING

21:57.616 --> 21:58.884
TO PUMP A TON OF GROUNDWATER

21:58.950 --> 22:02.487
OUT, AND ALSO BECAUSE IF YOUR

22:02.554 --> 22:03.689
DOG IS TRYING TO TELL YOU TIMMY

22:03.755 --> 22:04.256
IS STUCK DOWN A WELL: WHICH

22:04.322 --> 22:07.592
WELL, RUSTY?

22:07.659 --> 22:07.959
[LAUGHTER]

22:08.026 --> 22:09.161
THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THEM!

22:09.227 --> 22:10.062
WHICH FUCKING WELL?

22:10.128 --> 22:10.896
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME MORE THAN

22:10.962 --> 22:13.298
"ARF ARF" HERE!

22:13.365 --> 22:15.534
WHERE IS THE BOY?

22:15.600 --> 22:16.568
[LAUGHTER]

22:16.635 --> 22:17.803
AND IT'S NOT JUST ARIZONA.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.204
BIG FARMING OPERATIONS HAVE LONG

22:19.271 --> 22:19.838
BEEN PUMPING GROUNDWATER IN THE

22:19.905 --> 22:20.706
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY IN

22:20.772 --> 22:21.640
CALIFORNIA.

22:21.707 --> 22:22.441
AND IT'S HAD SOME PRETTY SEVERE

22:22.507 --> 22:23.508
CONSEQUENCES.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.143
>> WHEN THIS MUCH WATER IS

22:25.210 --> 22:26.244
PUMPED OUT OF THE AQUIFER BELOW

22:26.311 --> 22:27.813
GROUND, THE CLAY BETWEEN THE

22:27.879 --> 22:29.281
POCKETS OF WATER COLLAPSES AND

22:29.347 --> 22:30.949
THE GROUND STARTS TO DEFLATE

22:31.016 --> 22:33.251
LIKE A LEAKY AIR MATTRESS.

22:33.318 --> 22:34.386
THE SINKING IS BUCKLING THE

22:34.453 --> 22:36.521
WALLS OF IRRIGATION CANALS,

22:36.588 --> 22:38.523
DAMAGING PIPES, CREATING GIANT

22:38.590 --> 22:41.159
SINK HOLES, AND CRACKING HOMES.

22:41.226 --> 22:43.161
THIS BRIDGE HAS DROPPED SO MUCH,

22:43.228 --> 22:45.964
THE WATER WILL SOON FLOW OVER

22:46.031 --> 22:48.033
IT INSTEAD OF UNDER IT.

22:48.100 --> 22:48.834
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE, AND

22:48.900 --> 22:50.402
THIS IS NOT A NEW PROBLEM.

22:50.469 --> 22:52.404
A SCIENTIST IN CALIFORNIA ONCE

22:52.471 --> 22:54.139
MARKED JUST HOW MUCH THE LAND

22:54.206 --> 22:55.173
HAD SUNK FROM 1925 TO 1977 ON A

22:55.240 --> 22:57.709
TELEPHONE POLE.

22:57.776 --> 22:59.344
AND THAT IS A STARTLING DROP.

22:59.411 --> 23:00.712
ALTHOUGH, IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW

23:00.779 --> 23:01.480
WHAT THAT WAS MEASURING, YOU

23:01.546 --> 23:03.048
WOULD BE PRETTY CONFUSED.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.950
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE WAS

23:05.016 --> 23:05.550
MEASURING THE SHRINKING HEIGHT

23:05.617 --> 23:06.051
OF AN ELDERLY GIANT WITH

23:06.118 --> 23:08.186
OSTEOPOROSIS.

23:08.253 --> 23:09.755
[LAUGHTER]

23:09.821 --> 23:10.822
BUT IN RECENT YEARS, AS LARGE

23:10.889 --> 23:12.491
FARMING OPERATIONS HAVE DRILLED

23:12.557 --> 23:14.359
DEEPER AND SUCKED UP MORE WATER,

23:14.426 --> 23:15.494
THERE HAVE BEEN ESCALATING

23:15.560 --> 23:16.661
IMPACTS FOR THE SHALLOWER WELLS

23:16.728 --> 23:19.464
THAT FAMILIES USE.

23:19.531 --> 23:20.665
LAST YEAR IN CALIFORNIA, NEARLY

23:20.732 --> 23:21.900
A THOUSAND SHALLOW HOUSEHOLD

23:21.967 --> 23:23.602
WELLS WENT DRY.

23:23.668 --> 23:26.138
AND FOR ANYONE WHO'S EVER LOST

23:26.204 --> 23:27.372
ONE, IT CAN BE A REAL BURDEN.

23:27.439 --> 23:28.673
>> THIS IS WHERE WE CATCH OUR

23:28.740 --> 23:30.776
WATER SO WE CAN FLUSH TOILETS.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.411
GET UP IN THE MORNING, TAKE TWO

23:33.478 --> 23:35.113
BOTTLES OF RAINWATER, PUT IT IN

23:35.180 --> 23:36.214
THE COFFEE POT, MY FIANCE WILL

23:36.281 --> 23:38.183
COME IN.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.718
SHE'LL HELP ME WASH MY HANDS,

23:39.785 --> 23:41.319
AND WE'LL TAKE THIS WATER,

23:41.386 --> 23:42.821
RECYCLE IT, PUT IT IN A BUCKET

23:42.888 --> 23:43.822
OUT THERE UNTIL IT GETS ENOUGH

23:43.889 --> 23:44.623
TO WHERE WE CAN FLUSH THE

23:44.689 --> 23:45.791
TOILET.

23:45.857 --> 23:49.227
>> WHAT ABOUT SHOWERING?

23:49.294 --> 23:51.029
>> WELL, USUALLY WE HAVE TO GO

23:51.096 --> 23:52.030
INTO TOWN TO ONE OF MY FRIEND'S

23:52.097 --> 23:53.098
HOUSE.

23:53.165 --> 23:54.266
AND IF I CAN'T GO TO MY FRIEND'S

23:54.332 --> 23:56.268
HOUSE, YOU'LL SEE SOME GUYS

23:56.334 --> 23:58.236
THAT -- THERE'S ADS, EVEN, ON

23:58.303 --> 23:58.870
CRAIGSLIST, TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A

23:58.937 --> 23:59.538
SHOWER.

23:59.604 --> 24:00.972
"FIVE BUCKS TO TAKE A SHOWER,"

24:01.039 --> 24:02.174
THAT KIND OF STUFF.

24:02.240 --> 24:03.175
THAT'S WHAT KIND OF PLACE IT IS

24:03.241 --> 24:04.209
AROUND HERE.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.443
>> John: WOW.

24:05.510 --> 24:06.378
USING CRAIGSLIST TO TAKE A

24:06.444 --> 24:09.748
SHOWER.

24:09.815 --> 24:10.148
[LAUGHTER]

24:10.215 --> 24:11.883
THAT IS LEGITIMATELY HORRIFYING.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.218
HOW DO YOU EVEN WRITE AN AD FOR

24:13.285 --> 24:13.752
THAT WITHOUT IT SOUNDING

24:13.819 --> 24:14.986
SUSPICIOUS?

24:15.053 --> 24:16.855
"SEEKING SHOWER FOR $5:

24:16.922 --> 24:18.156
34-YEAR-OLD ADULT NON-CREEP

24:18.223 --> 24:19.424
LOOKING FOR FELLOW NON-CREEPY

24:19.491 --> 24:20.192
ADULT TO ALLOW ME TO USE THEIR

24:20.258 --> 24:20.926
SHOWER.

24:20.992 --> 24:22.227
THIS IS NOT A EUPHEMISM.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.461
THERE'S A WATER SHORTAGE AND I

24:23.528 --> 24:23.995
GENUINELY JUST WANT TO GET

24:24.062 --> 24:24.863
WASHED.

24:24.930 --> 24:28.099
AGAIN, NOT A EUPHEMISM.

24:28.166 --> 24:29.801
THIS ISN'T SEXUAL IN ANY WAY.

24:29.868 --> 24:30.902
I WILL HAPPILY PAY FIVE AMERICAN

24:30.969 --> 24:31.570
DOLLARS FOR THE SHOWER.

24:31.636 --> 24:32.971
YOU CAN'T WATCH, YOU CAN'T TAPE

24:33.038 --> 24:33.805
IT, YOU CAN'T BE WEIRD.

24:33.872 --> 24:34.940
I'M JUST GOING TO COME INTO YOUR

24:35.006 --> 24:36.041
HOUSE, HAND YOU A $5 BILL, GET

24:36.107 --> 24:38.043
IN THE SHOWER, WASH MY HAIR AND

24:38.109 --> 24:38.710
BODY AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE, AND

24:38.777 --> 24:39.578
THEN LEAVE, ALL WHILE MAKING THE

24:39.644 --> 24:40.445
LEAST AMOUNT OF EYE CONTACT

24:40.512 --> 24:41.446
POSSIBLE.

24:41.513 --> 24:42.247
WE WON'T TALK OR HAVE ANY

24:42.314 --> 24:43.481
CONVERSATION.

24:43.548 --> 24:44.115
IDEALLY, YOU WILL FORGET THIS

24:44.182 --> 24:45.817
WHOLE THING EVER HAPPENED.

24:45.884 --> 24:46.852
ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT, I DON'T

24:46.918 --> 24:47.519
LIKE THE WAY ANY OF THIS IS

24:47.586 --> 24:48.253
SOUNDING, SO I'M JUST GOING TO

24:48.320 --> 24:49.955
STAY DIRTY FOREVER.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.156
PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME WITH

24:51.223 --> 24:53.925
UNSOLICITED SERVICES OR OFFERS."

24:53.992 --> 24:54.559
[LAUGHTER]

24:54.626 --> 24:56.628
[APPLAUSE]

24:56.695 --> 24:58.463
BUT PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT

24:58.530 --> 24:59.464
THING TO KNOW ABOUT GROUNDWATER

24:59.531 --> 25:00.432
IS THAT IT'S NOT TOTALLY

25:00.498 --> 25:01.366
INDEPENDENT OF SURFACE WATER AT

25:01.433 --> 25:02.334
ALL.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.969
THESE ARE OFTEN PART OF ONE

25:04.035 --> 25:06.705
INTERTWINED HYDROLOGICAL SYSTEM,

25:06.771 --> 25:08.306
SO WHEN YOU PUMP GROUNDWATER, IT

25:08.373 --> 25:10.475
CAN ULTIMATELY DRY UP RIVERS.

25:10.542 --> 25:11.610
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN

25:11.676 --> 25:13.211
GROUNDWATER AND SURFACE WATER IS

25:13.278 --> 25:14.546
ONE OF THOSE ALARMING

25:14.613 --> 25:15.180
CONNECTIONS THAT WE JUST CHOOSE

25:15.247 --> 25:16.314
TO FORGET.

25:16.381 --> 25:17.515
YOU KNOW, LIKE THE ONE BETWEEN

25:17.582 --> 25:19.584
ELISABETH MOSS AND SCIENTOLOGY.

25:19.651 --> 25:23.388
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER JUST NOT TO

25:23.455 --> 25:25.724
REALLY THINK ABOUT IT.

25:25.790 --> 25:26.658
[LAUGHTER]

25:26.725 --> 25:27.859
SO, TO RECAP: FOR DECADES NOW,

25:27.926 --> 25:29.194
WE'VE BEEN USING MORE WATER THAN

25:29.261 --> 25:30.896
THE COLORADO RIVER HAS, EVEN AS

25:30.962 --> 25:31.563
WE HAVE RAPIDLY DEPLETED

25:31.630 --> 25:33.365
CRITICAL GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES.

25:33.431 --> 25:35.033
AND WHEN IT COMES TO RESPONDING

25:35.100 --> 25:36.167
TO THIS CRISIS, PLACES HAVE GONE

25:36.234 --> 25:39.037
IN VERY DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

25:39.104 --> 25:39.671
ONE OF THE BEST ACTORS, AND YOU

25:39.738 --> 25:41.306
ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS,

25:41.373 --> 25:43.575
IS ACTUALLY LAS VEGAS.

25:43.642 --> 25:45.644
WHICH I KNOW AUTOMATICALLY FEELS

25:45.710 --> 25:47.946
WEIRD, BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK OF

25:48.013 --> 25:48.580
VEGAS, YOU PROBABLY THINK OF IT

25:48.647 --> 25:49.214
AS A PLACE THAT USES WATER FOR

25:49.281 --> 25:50.515
THINGS LIKE THIS:

25:50.582 --> 25:55.220
>> HOW YOU DOIN'?

25:55.287 --> 25:58.290
>> SO, WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT?

25:58.356 --> 26:01.793
>> THIS IS JUST A MUSTY

26:01.860 --> 26:03.028
WATERFALL, A DRIZZLING FOUNTAIN.

26:03.094 --> 26:04.062
>> APPRECIATE THE UNIQUENESS.

26:04.129 --> 26:11.169
["FRIENDS" THEME SONG]

26:11.236 --> 26:11.436
[LAUGHTER]

26:11.503 --> 26:13.305
>> John: I HONESTLY FEEL BAD FOR

26:13.371 --> 26:14.439
THAT FOUNTAIN.

26:14.506 --> 26:15.507
NO DROP OF WATER EVER DREAMED OF

26:15.573 --> 26:17.242
ONE DAY BEING FORCED TO DANCE TO

26:17.309 --> 26:18.176
THE "FRIENDS" THEME FOR A BUNCH

26:18.243 --> 26:22.080
OF DRUNK VEGAS TOURISTS.

26:22.147 --> 26:22.714
NO ONE TOLD THEM LIFE WAS GONNA

26:22.781 --> 26:25.150
BE THIS WAY.

26:25.216 --> 26:25.917
[LAUGHTER]

26:25.984 --> 26:27.185
BUT THE THING IS, DESPITE

26:27.252 --> 26:28.486
LOOKING EXTREMELY WASTEFUL, THE

26:28.553 --> 26:29.220
BELLAGIO'S FOUNTAIN ACTUALLY

26:29.287 --> 26:30.155
ISN'T.

26:30.221 --> 26:31.523
IT USES WATER THAT'S TOO SALTY

26:31.589 --> 26:33.258
TO DRINK, AND ANNUALLY ONLY USES

26:33.325 --> 26:34.225
AS MUCH AS WOULD IRRIGATE JUST

26:34.292 --> 26:35.460
EIGHT ACRES OF ALFALFA.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.228
AND THAT IS JUST ONE TINY WAY

26:37.295 --> 26:38.229
THAT THE PEOPLE OF VEGAS HAVE

26:38.296 --> 26:39.798
LEARNED TO CONSERVE WATER.

26:39.864 --> 26:41.499
THEY'VE ALSO BANNED NEW LAWNS

26:41.566 --> 26:42.767
AND ORNAMENTAL GRASS THERE,

26:42.834 --> 26:43.768
WHICH SHOULD SAVE ABOUT TEN

26:43.835 --> 26:46.071
BILLION GALLONS A YEAR.

26:46.137 --> 26:48.073
AND OVERALL, EVEN THOUGH THE

26:48.139 --> 26:49.374
POPULATION OF THE VEGAS METRO

26:49.441 --> 26:52.410
AREA GREW BY 34% BETWEEN 2002

26:52.477 --> 26:54.646
AND 2013, ITS USE OF COLORADO

26:54.713 --> 26:55.714
RIVER WATER ACTUALLY DROPPED BY

26:55.780 --> 26:58.283
OVER A QUARTER.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.951
SO VEGAS COULD ACTUALLY BE

27:00.018 --> 27:01.419
SOMETHING OF A MODEL FOR OTHER

27:01.486 --> 27:02.687
PLACES WHEN IT COMES TO WATER

27:02.754 --> 27:03.254
CONSERVATION, AND LITERALLY

27:03.321 --> 27:05.557
NOTHING ELSE.

27:05.623 --> 27:06.791
[LAUGHTER]

27:06.858 --> 27:07.792
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, NOT

27:07.859 --> 27:08.927
EVERYWHERE IS TAKING IT THAT

27:08.994 --> 27:09.995
SERIOUSLY, WITH THE WORST

27:10.061 --> 27:12.263
EXAMPLE BEING UTAH.

27:12.330 --> 27:14.332
HOME OF BOTH THE UTAH JAZZ AND

27:14.399 --> 27:16.001
THEIR MASCOT, JAZZ BEAR, WHO

27:16.067 --> 27:17.702
ANSWERS THE QUESTION, "WHAT IF

27:17.769 --> 27:18.937
WILE E. COYOTE WAS A JOCK WHO

27:19.004 --> 27:19.604
ALSO WANTED TO MURDER ME IN MY

27:19.671 --> 27:21.873
SLEEP?"

27:21.940 --> 27:22.574
[LAUGHTER]

27:22.640 --> 27:25.677
CRUSH ME, KING.

27:25.744 --> 27:26.778
UTAH RESIDENTS USE THE MOST

27:26.845 --> 27:28.646
WATER OF ANY WESTERN STATE.

27:28.713 --> 27:30.315
AND NOWHERE IS THIS MORE TRUE

27:30.382 --> 27:31.516
THAN ST. GEORGE, WHICH HAS

27:31.583 --> 27:32.751
BECOME ONE OF THE

27:32.817 --> 27:34.319
FASTEST-GROWING METRO AREAS IN

27:34.386 --> 27:35.587
THE COUNTRY, WITH PER-PERSON

27:35.653 --> 27:36.287
WATER CONSUMPTION AMONG THE

27:36.354 --> 27:37.889
HIGHEST.

27:37.956 --> 27:39.891
NOT ONLY DOES ST. GEORGE HAVE

27:39.958 --> 27:41.693
VERY CHEAP WATER RATES, THEIR

27:41.760 --> 27:43.028
COUNTY -- WHICH IS IN THE

27:43.094 --> 27:45.663
DESERT, REMEMBER -- HAS AT LEAST

27:45.730 --> 27:47.032
A DOZEN GOLF COURSES, INCLUDING

27:47.098 --> 27:48.333
THESE.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.667
AND GOLF COURSES USE A SHIT-TON

27:49.734 --> 27:51.169
OF WATER!

27:51.236 --> 27:53.938
THEY ARE PRETTY MUCH THE DUMBEST

27:54.005 --> 27:54.539
POSSIBLE THING TO PUT INTO THE

27:54.606 --> 27:55.407
MIDDLE OF THE DESERT, OTHER

27:55.473 --> 27:57.976
THAN, OF COURSE, BURNING MAN.

27:58.043 --> 27:59.077
[LAUGHTER]

27:59.144 --> 28:00.345
AND WHILE UTAH HAS RECENTLY

28:00.412 --> 28:01.646
PASSED SOME NEW LAWS ENCOURAGING

28:01.713 --> 28:02.914
CONSERVATION, THEY'VE ALSO BEEN

28:02.981 --> 28:04.516
PURSUING A BILLION DOLLAR

28:04.582 --> 28:05.984
PIPELINE TO BRING IN WHAT SOME

28:06.051 --> 28:08.386
IN UTAH INSIST IS ADDITIONAL

28:08.453 --> 28:13.491
SURPLUS WATER FROM LAKE POWELL,

28:13.558 --> 28:14.492
A SURPLUS THAT ANYONE WHO SO

28:14.559 --> 28:15.827
MUCH AS LOOKS AT THAT LAKE WOULD

28:15.894 --> 28:17.495
KNOW, SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST.

28:17.562 --> 28:18.129
AND I KNOW THAT SEEMS WILDLY

28:18.196 --> 28:20.698
IRRESPONSIBLE ON UTAH'S PART.

28:20.765 --> 28:23.368
AND THAT IS BECAUSE IT IS.

28:23.435 --> 28:24.269
THOUGH, TO BE FAIR, IT'S STILL

28:24.335 --> 28:25.336
NOT THE WORST IDEA THEY'VE HAD.

28:25.403 --> 28:26.771
BECAUSE JUST WATCH THIS VIDEO

28:26.838 --> 28:28.206
FROM THE GOVERNOR OF UTAH IN

28:28.273 --> 28:30.875
RESPONSE TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS

28:30.942 --> 28:32.077
THERE JUST LAST YEAR.

28:32.143 --> 28:33.445
>> WE NEED MORE RAIN, AND WE

28:33.511 --> 28:34.245
NEED IT NOW.

28:34.312 --> 28:34.946
WE NEED SOME DIVINE

28:35.013 --> 28:37.415
INTERVENTION.

28:37.482 --> 28:38.083
[LAUGHTER]

28:38.149 --> 28:39.384
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING UTAHNS OF

28:39.451 --> 28:41.152
ALL FAITHS TO JOIN ME IN A

28:41.219 --> 28:42.287
WEEKEND OF PRAYER, JUNE 4TH

28:42.353 --> 28:44.389
THROUGH THE 6TH.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.124
BY PRAYING COLLABORATIVELY AND

28:46.191 --> 28:47.392
COLLECTIVELY, ASKING GOD OR

28:47.459 --> 28:49.527
WHATEVER HIGHER POWER YOU

28:49.594 --> 28:51.262
BELIEVE IN FOR MORE RAIN, WE MAY

28:51.329 --> 28:52.697
BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THE DEADLIEST

28:52.764 --> 28:53.565
ASPECTS OF THE CONTINUING

28:53.631 --> 28:54.632
DROUGHT.

28:54.699 --> 28:57.302
>> John WOW.

28:57.368 --> 28:59.971
YOU KNOW UTAH IS DESPERATE WHEN

29:00.038 --> 29:01.039
THEY ASK "ALL FAITHS" TO JOIN IN

29:01.106 --> 29:02.974
A PRAYER.

29:03.041 --> 29:04.075
"I'M ASKING UTAHNS OF ALL

29:04.142 --> 29:05.643
FAITHS -- WHETHER THAT'S THE

29:05.710 --> 29:07.145
MORMON, OR ONE OF THE MANY WRONG

29:07.212 --> 29:08.947
ONES -- TO COLLECTIVELY PRAY TO

29:09.013 --> 29:10.882
THE CHRISTIAN GOD AND THE FALSE

29:10.949 --> 29:12.650
DEITIES THE REST OF YOU WORSHIP

29:12.717 --> 29:14.419
FOR MORE RAIN, SO WE CAN SOLVE

29:14.486 --> 29:15.587
THIS CRISIS BEFORE THOSE OF YOU

29:15.653 --> 29:16.921
WHO HAVE NOT ACCEPTED JESUS

29:16.988 --> 29:18.022
CHRIST INTO YOUR HEART BURN IN

29:18.089 --> 29:20.592
THE FIRES OF ETERNAL HELL."

29:20.658 --> 29:22.760
[LAUGHTER]

29:22.827 --> 29:23.495
SO WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT ALL

29:23.561 --> 29:24.562
THIS?

29:24.629 --> 29:25.330
WELL, WE CAN START BY

29:25.396 --> 29:26.264
ACKNOWLEDGING SOME UNCOMFORTABLE

29:26.331 --> 29:27.265
TRUTHS.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.801
FIRST, STATES LIKE UTAH ARE NOT

29:29.868 --> 29:31.136
GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE THE FULL

29:31.202 --> 29:32.137
AMOUNT OF WATER THEY THINK

29:32.203 --> 29:34.005
THEY'RE ENTITLED TO, PRIMARILY

29:34.072 --> 29:35.039
BECAUSE THAT FULL AMOUNT NEVER

29:35.106 --> 29:35.740
ACTUALLY EXISTED IN THE FIRST

29:35.807 --> 29:37.742
PLACE.

29:37.809 --> 29:39.477
BUT IT IS NOT JUST UTAH.

29:39.544 --> 29:41.146
NO STATE CAN CONTINUE USING

29:41.212 --> 29:41.813
WATER THE WAY THEY'VE GOTTEN

29:41.880 --> 29:42.847
USED TO.

29:42.914 --> 29:44.215
EXPERTS SUGGEST IT MIGHT HELP

29:44.282 --> 29:46.885
ACTUALLY NOT TO USE THE WORD

29:46.951 --> 29:48.853
"DROUGHT" AT ALL, WHICH SOUNDS

29:48.920 --> 29:54.092
TEMPORARY, AND INSTEAD USE THE

29:54.159 --> 29:54.993
TERM "ARIDIFICATION" AS A

29:55.059 --> 29:56.528
BETTER WAY TO DESCRIBE WHAT

29:56.594 --> 29:57.862
MIGHT BE A LONG-TERM DRYING OF

29:57.929 --> 29:58.830
THE AMERICAN WEST.

29:58.897 --> 29:59.931
SO WE NEED TO BE INCENTIVIZING

29:59.998 --> 30:00.732
CONSERVATION AND WATER

30:00.798 --> 30:02.300
EFFICIENCY, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT

30:02.367 --> 30:03.334
COMES TO AGRICULTURE, AND STOP

30:03.401 --> 30:04.869
WITH OUR MAGICAL THINKING TOWARD

30:04.936 --> 30:08.806
WATER, WHICH HAS BEEN A

30:08.873 --> 30:12.143
DEPRESSINGLY COMMON THEME

30:12.210 --> 30:13.378
THROUGHOUT HISTORY.

30:13.444 --> 30:14.212
DURING A DROUGHT IN THE '90s,

30:14.279 --> 30:15.780
CITY OFFICIALS IN VENTURA,

30:15.847 --> 30:16.981
CALIFORNIA, DECIDED TO STUDY THE

30:17.048 --> 30:17.849
POSSIBILITY OF HAULING ICEBERGS

30:17.916 --> 30:19.083
FROM THE POLAR CAPS AND PLANTING

30:19.150 --> 30:20.151
THEM OFF THE COUNTY'S SHORES.

30:20.218 --> 30:21.819
ONE PROPONENT EVEN SUGGESTED,

30:21.886 --> 30:23.621
"WE'D HAVE TO WRAP THE ICEBERG

30:23.688 --> 30:25.290
WITH A DIAPER" TO COLLECT THE

30:25.356 --> 30:27.058
MELTING ICEBERG WATER.

30:27.125 --> 30:28.426
MORE RECENTLY, ARIZONA PASSED A

30:28.493 --> 30:30.094
RESOLUTION TO STUDY BUILDING A

30:30.161 --> 30:31.329
PIPELINE FROM THE MISSISSIPPI

30:31.396 --> 30:33.731
RIVER TO THE COLORADO RIVER.

30:33.798 --> 30:36.734
AND IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN A MAP OF

30:36.801 --> 30:38.670
THE U.S., YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED

30:38.736 --> 30:39.537
THAT THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER IS

30:39.604 --> 30:40.872
ALL THE WAY OVER HERE, AND

30:40.939 --> 30:42.507
ARIZONA IS ALL THE WAY OVER

30:42.574 --> 30:43.741
HERE, SO TO DO THAT, YOU'D NEED

30:43.808 --> 30:44.876
A PIPELINE THAT'S OVER A

30:44.943 --> 30:46.945
THOUSAND MILES LONG.

30:47.011 --> 30:48.479
AND THE ONLY WAY THAT IDEA COULD

30:48.546 --> 30:49.247
GET ANY DUMBER IS IF THE

30:49.314 --> 30:49.914
PIPELINE WAS ALSO SOMEHOW

30:49.981 --> 30:52.517
WRAPPED IN A DIAPER.

30:52.584 --> 30:53.618
[LAUGHTER]

30:53.685 --> 30:54.519
DON'T WORRY, EVERYONE: CHASE IS

30:54.586 --> 30:58.856
ON THE CASE!

30:58.923 --> 31:00.058
THE FACT IS, STATES NEED TO

31:00.124 --> 31:00.658
START WORKING TOGETHER TO CUT

31:00.725 --> 31:01.759
BACK ON THEIR COLLECTIVE WATER

31:01.826 --> 31:02.293
USE.

31:02.360 --> 31:03.728
AND SOME HAVE TRIED SMALL STEPS.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.096
IN ARIZONA -- HOME, REMEMBER, TO

31:05.163 --> 31:06.998
OUR CLOSE-UP ALFALFA FARMER --

31:07.065 --> 31:07.966
THEY RECENTLY CHANGED THEIR "USE

31:08.032 --> 31:09.367
IT OR LOSE IT" RULES TO ALLOW

31:09.434 --> 31:10.468
FOR MORE CONSERVATION.

31:10.535 --> 31:12.270
AND IN CALIFORNIA, IN 2014, THEY

31:12.337 --> 31:13.571
PASSED THE SUSTAINABLE

31:13.638 --> 31:14.372
GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT, TO

31:14.439 --> 31:15.406
TRY AND BRING GROUNDWATER

31:15.473 --> 31:18.776
PUMPING UNDER CONTROL.

31:18.843 --> 31:20.111
BUT IT IS JUST NOT ENOUGH.

31:20.178 --> 31:22.213
AND THAT MAY BE WHY SOMETHING

31:22.280 --> 31:22.814
VERY BIG HAPPENED JUST A WEEK

31:22.880 --> 31:24.082
AGO.

31:24.148 --> 31:26.284
BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT DROPPED A

31:26.351 --> 31:28.486
BOMBSHELL ON THE COLORADO RIVER

31:28.553 --> 31:29.821
STATES, TELLING THEM "THEY HAVE

31:29.887 --> 31:31.389
60 DAYS TO CREATE AN EMERGENCY

31:31.456 --> 31:33.524
PLAN TO STOP USING BETWEEN TWO

31:33.591 --> 31:35.293
AND FOUR MILLION ACRE-FEET OF

31:35.360 --> 31:43.568
WATER IN THE NEXT YEAR," WHICH

31:43.635 --> 31:45.136
IS A MASSIVE AMOUNT, "OR THE

31:45.203 --> 31:46.037
AGENCY WILL USE ITS EMERGENCY

31:46.104 --> 31:47.071
AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE CUTS

31:47.138 --> 31:47.839
ITSELF."

31:47.905 --> 31:49.073
WHICH IS A DRASTIC MOVE, BUT WE

31:49.140 --> 31:49.841
ARE IN A DRASTIC SITUATION.

31:49.907 --> 31:50.908
SO LET'S HOPE THOSE STATES GET

31:50.975 --> 31:52.176
TO WORK IN THE NEXT TWO MONTHS

31:52.243 --> 31:53.611
AND COME UP WITH A DECENT PLAN.

31:53.678 --> 31:54.545
BECAUSE WE DESPERATELY NEED TO

31:54.612 --> 31:56.314
PREPARE FOR A MUCH DRIER FUTURE

31:56.381 --> 31:57.849
IN THE AMERICAN WEST, AND DO IT

31:57.915 --> 32:00.551
MORE EQUITABLY THIS TIME.

32:00.618 --> 32:01.686
BECAUSE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE

32:01.753 --> 32:04.289
LEARN FROM OUR PAST MISTAKES.

32:04.355 --> 32:05.823
AND FOR ANYONE WHO STILL THINKS

32:05.890 --> 32:08.393
THAT THIS IS SOMETHING WE CAN

32:08.459 --> 32:09.994
JUST PRAY OUR WAY OUT OF, I

32:10.061 --> 32:11.429
ACTUALLY HAVE A SPECIAL MESSAGE

32:11.496 --> 32:16.000
FROM A VERY SPECIAL GUEST:

32:16.067 --> 32:22.173
[ANGELIC SINGING]

32:22.240 --> 32:25.310
>> HI.

32:25.376 --> 32:28.279
IT'S ME, GOD.

32:28.346 --> 32:30.381
I KNOW I DON'T OFTEN DO THIS,

32:30.448 --> 32:31.816
BUT I JUST WANTED TO APPEAR IN

32:31.883 --> 32:34.619
PERSON TO MAKE ONE THING

32:34.686 --> 32:36.988
PERFECTLY CLEAR: YOU CAN'T PRAY

32:37.055 --> 32:39.590
YOUR WAY OUT OF A DROUGHT.

32:39.657 --> 32:40.792
FRANKLY, I'M INSULTED YOU EVEN

32:40.858 --> 32:42.760
ASKED ME.

32:42.827 --> 32:44.796
YOU GOT YOURSELF IN THIS FUCKING

32:44.862 --> 32:46.431
MESS, GET YOURSELF THE FUCK OUT

32:46.497 --> 32:47.899
OF IT.

32:47.965 --> 32:50.101
I GAVE YOU PLENTY OF WATER.

32:50.168 --> 32:51.369
IT'S NOT MY FAULT YOU WASTED IT

32:51.436 --> 32:53.471
BUILDING SURFING LAGOONS AND

32:53.538 --> 32:54.672
GOLF COURSES IN THE MIDDLE OF A

32:54.739 --> 32:59.477
FUCKING DESERT.

32:59.544 --> 33:01.446
UTAH, YOUR CAPITAL IS

33:01.512 --> 33:04.749
SALT LAKE CITY.

33:04.816 --> 33:08.519
IT'S NEXT TO A SALT LAKE.

33:08.586 --> 33:10.922
A LAKE OF SALT.

33:10.988 --> 33:13.725
TAKE THE FUCKING HINT.

33:13.791 --> 33:15.626
SO, NO, I WILL NOT BE ANSWERING

33:15.693 --> 33:17.762
YOUR PRAYER FOR RAIN.

33:17.829 --> 33:20.898
FOR THE RECORD, I'VE ONLY EVER,

33:20.965 --> 33:23.000
EVER ANSWERED ONE PRAYER: LITTLE

33:23.067 --> 33:26.104
TIMMY PENDLETON WANTED A HESS

33:26.170 --> 33:29.107
TRUCK FOR HIS BIRTHDAY IN 1986,

33:29.173 --> 33:32.443
AND I MADE SURE HE GOT ONE.

33:32.510 --> 33:34.979
THE KID JUST REALLY SEEMED TO

33:35.046 --> 33:36.681
WANT THAT TRUCK, AND MAYBE I

33:36.748 --> 33:38.116
FELT BAD ABOUT KILLING BOTH HIS

33:38.182 --> 33:39.350
PARENTS WITH THAT TORNADO.

33:39.417 --> 33:41.786
I DON'T KNOW.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.554
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS I'D

33:43.621 --> 33:45.590
RATHER TALK ABOUT TO YOU THAN

33:45.656 --> 33:50.128
YOUR STUPID, STUPID WATER USAGE!

33:50.194 --> 33:51.696
LIKE THE MEANING OF LIFE, OR

33:51.763 --> 33:52.597
WHICH ANIMAL I CREATED BY

33:52.663 --> 33:54.198
MISTAKE.

33:54.265 --> 33:57.201
GUINEA PIGS, BY THE WAY.

33:57.268 --> 34:00.605
THE POINT IS, I WANT HUMANS OF

34:00.671 --> 34:03.441
ALL FAITHS TO COME TOGETHER AND

34:03.508 --> 34:06.344
ACT LIKE RATIONAL FUCKING ADULTS

34:06.411 --> 34:09.080
WHEN IT COMES TO WATER USE.

34:09.147 --> 34:11.482
HEED MY WORDS, MY CHILDREN, AND

34:11.549 --> 34:13.918
CONSERVE THE ONCE BOUNTIFUL

34:13.985 --> 34:16.687
GIFTS OF RIVERS AND LAKES, WHICH

34:16.754 --> 34:22.860
I CREATED FOR YOU ON EARTH.

34:22.927 --> 34:29.133
NOW, FUCK OFF.

34:29.200 --> 34:30.435
[APPLAUSE]

34:30.501 --> 34:31.602
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW, THANK

34:31.669 --> 34:32.770
YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

34:32.837 --> 34:34.038
WE'RE OFF FOR A FEW WEEKS, BACK

34:34.105 --> 34:34.439
JULY 24TH.

34:34.505 --> 34:37.508
SEE YOU THEN, GOOD NIGHT!

34:37.575 --> 34:43.114
