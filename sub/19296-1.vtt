00:25.500 --> 00:27.872
Keep your hands off me!

00:29.712 --> 00:32.000
- I'll be with you in a moment.
- Don't walk away.

00:32.171 --> 00:35.588
- Doctor, I can't feel my arm.
- Just a minute.

00:36.968 --> 00:39.755
- I can't feel my arm.
- I can't feel it right now either.

00:39.929 --> 00:42.715
- Can someone feel his arm?
- I can't feel it.

00:45.934 --> 00:47.344
Don't touch my hair.

00:47.518 --> 00:49.392
Kiss the boo-boo. Kiss the boo-boo.

00:49.562 --> 00:52.681
- Hey, you're still here.
- Yeah, I'm still here. Can you believe it?

00:52.856 --> 00:56.688
Save me some coffee, you savage.

00:58.778 --> 01:00.687
<i>What is this,
Alfred Hitchcock Presents?</i>

01:05.200 --> 01:08.070
- What's the problem?
- Gunshot wounds. Shoulder, abdomen.

01:08.244 --> 01:10.782
We've been paging you.
You on California time already?

01:10.955 --> 01:13.659
- I was in Radiology working on my tan.
- Pulse, 120.

01:13.832 --> 01:15.908
Get this guy typed and crossed, huh?

01:16.376 --> 01:20.325
Okay, question: Beverly Hills,
beautiful women and plastic surgery...

01:20.504 --> 01:23.421
...what do these three things
have in common?

01:23.590 --> 01:24.918
Me, in less than a week.

01:25.717 --> 01:29.168
Okay, don't worry about his shoulder.
He's probably bleeding internally.

01:29.345 --> 01:32.511
Call Dr. Sotto, tell him to prep for O.R.
I'm out of here tonight.

01:32.681 --> 01:36.215
Convince me I'll be nostalgic for here
when I'm at the Halberstrom Clinic.

01:36.393 --> 01:38.515
- Halberstrom?
- Cosmetic surgery for the rich.

01:38.686 --> 01:42.304
- I'm not in it for the money.
- Half a million salary when he's partner.

01:42.481 --> 01:46.810
That high-profit stuff makes it possible
for us to do reconstructive surgery...

01:46.985 --> 01:49.191
...on the needier patients.
- You're a saint.

01:49.362 --> 01:53.406
- Got another customer over there.
- I'll do it. My going-away present to you.

01:53.574 --> 01:56.942
- What's the problem?
- Too much fun. Substance unknown.

01:57.118 --> 02:00.617
Okay, stay with us. Stay with us.
What'd you take, man?

02:00.788 --> 02:02.661
Bluebirds, dillies, love boats?

02:02.831 --> 02:05.951
I heard Halberstrom might not
even hire anyone this year.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.370
Well, I'm not anyone.

02:07.961 --> 02:11.708
Mulready, some of the guys are having
a going-away bash for me tonight.

02:11.880 --> 02:14.834
- Lf you're interested, I'd love...
- Not in this lifetime.

02:18.678 --> 02:20.836
- Clean up.
- Thanks.

02:21.013 --> 02:24.049
Come on, what do you say, guys?
Dinner. Think about it.

02:24.224 --> 02:27.427
Come on, it's my last night.
A couple of lousy beers?

02:27.602 --> 02:29.890
- Take care, man.
- Guys...

02:33.190 --> 02:35.597
I'll send you a postcard.

02:36.484 --> 02:38.192
What?

02:38.778 --> 02:41.613
At the risk of sounding schmaltzy,
I just wanna tell you...

02:41.780 --> 02:44.401
...that you're a schmuck.
I hope I never see you again.

02:44.616 --> 02:47.866
Thanks, Tommy. I know how hard
it was for you to say that.

02:48.036 --> 02:52.496
You're a good doctor, Ben. I just thought
you were gonna practice real medicine.

02:53.999 --> 02:57.083
Think I'm making a mistake
going to Halberstrom?

02:58.419 --> 03:01.704
No. Cosmetic surgery is clean...

03:01.881 --> 03:05.331
...you make tons of money,
nobody dies.

03:05.759 --> 03:07.419
What's wrong with that, right?

03:07.594 --> 03:09.171
Right.

03:09.512 --> 03:11.255
Bye, Ben.

04:46.259 --> 04:48.964
Oh, come on.

05:13.449 --> 05:14.777
Look out.

05:37.344 --> 05:40.712
All right, okay. Can I just ask you...

05:40.888 --> 05:42.715
...where am I now?

06:49.571 --> 06:55.323
Oh, man. Oh, God. Oh, God.
I'm okay. I'm okay.

06:55.868 --> 06:59.995
Accident. Woman in the middle
of the road with a cow!

07:00.705 --> 07:02.863
All right. I'm okay.

07:03.290 --> 07:06.908
Damn, my car.
Oh, man, the whole front end is shot!

07:09.754 --> 07:11.082
Am I glad you're here.

07:13.132 --> 07:16.132
Is that a '56 or a '57 Speedster?

07:16.593 --> 07:18.586
Fifty-six.

07:19.012 --> 07:22.096
Hey, come on, get out.
Will you get out of the car!

07:22.265 --> 07:23.593
Get away from there.

07:23.766 --> 07:26.435
- Took three weeks to build that fence.
- I'm sorry.

07:26.602 --> 07:29.223
Does this have a Super 90 engine
or a 1600?

07:29.396 --> 07:31.471
It wasn't really anybody's fault.

07:31.648 --> 07:34.019
My insurance will probably pay
for the fence...

07:34.191 --> 07:35.934
...and that should be fine. Okay?

07:36.110 --> 07:38.434
- Won't be the same.
- This ain't a kit car, is it?

07:38.612 --> 07:40.604
No, it ain't. It isn't.

07:41.197 --> 07:44.281
My name is Ben Stone.

07:44.492 --> 07:46.733
I'm a medical doctor.
I'm a surgeon.

07:46.910 --> 07:48.618
Awesome. Who thrashed the fence?

07:48.787 --> 07:51.324
I'm Ben Stone. Here's the address
of my clinic in L.A.

07:51.497 --> 07:54.202
- Did he say he's been stoned?
- He says he's from L.A.

07:54.375 --> 07:56.663
You can send a bill there
or we can use plastic.

07:56.835 --> 07:59.124
I'm not really from L.A.
I'm just on my way to...

07:59.296 --> 08:03.756
- You're lucky I was passing through.
- What's in the trunk? Pot?

08:05.134 --> 08:08.965
I'm a surgeon. Come on, will you
get away! Get away from the car!

08:09.137 --> 08:10.714
- Sorry.
- Not you, the dog.

08:10.889 --> 08:12.548
The finest fence I'll ever put up.

08:12.723 --> 08:15.558
I know a Willie Stone in Stanton.
Is that family of yours?

08:15.726 --> 08:18.679
- I understand what you're trying to do.
- This the new Mazda?

08:18.854 --> 08:21.640
And I'm not putting up
with any small-town bullshit.

08:21.814 --> 08:24.056
Where's the dang engine?

08:24.233 --> 08:28.444
Get away from this car! You don't
even know where the engine is.

08:28.945 --> 08:30.819
Got you.

08:32.907 --> 08:35.611
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened...

08:35.784 --> 08:39.650
...but it was an accident, okay?
It was nobody's fault.

08:39.828 --> 08:43.162
Get me to a phone. I'll call
a Porsche mechanic in the next big city.

08:43.332 --> 08:47.460
I'll get my car fixed, be on my way,
and you can go back to doing...

08:47.628 --> 08:49.086
...whatever it is you do.

08:52.382 --> 08:55.168
All right, I admit it!
I flattened the damn fence!

08:55.342 --> 08:57.750
What are you gonna do, lock me up?

09:02.473 --> 09:06.885
Court finds the defendant guilty
of crimes under code 453-19...

09:07.061 --> 09:10.263
...reckless driving, and 466-2,
reckless endangerment.

09:10.438 --> 09:12.976
- This is insane.
- No, this is Grady.

09:13.149 --> 09:16.767
Your Honor, there were cows
in the middle of the road.

09:16.944 --> 09:20.692
Now, I told you my insurance company
would pay for a new fence.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.986
I built that fence myself.

09:23.157 --> 09:26.691
Neither you nor your insurance can
pay me for a fence I built myself.

09:26.869 --> 09:29.324
Next best thing would be
a fence that you built.

09:29.496 --> 09:33.575
- These hands are delicate instruments.
- I doubt you could build a good fence.

09:33.749 --> 09:35.955
Therefore, since you're
a licensed physician...

09:36.126 --> 09:38.831
...and we are a town in acute shortage
of medical care...

09:39.004 --> 09:42.088
- You wouldn't.
...your sentence will be 16 hours...

09:42.257 --> 09:43.751
...of community service...

09:43.925 --> 09:46.878
...served as resident doctor
at Grady Memorial Hospital.

09:47.052 --> 09:50.006
I have to be in Los Angeles
by Tuesday, so I don't...

09:50.180 --> 09:52.172
Thirty-two hours.

09:52.348 --> 09:55.384
- This is extortion!
- You want 64 hours?

09:56.727 --> 09:57.972
No.

09:58.895 --> 10:00.389
Court is adjourned.

10:00.564 --> 10:02.188
All rise.

10:02.899 --> 10:05.389
- I am so fucked.
- Watch your language, doc.

10:05.568 --> 10:10.774
You're in the buckle of the Bible belt
here. Try saying "fudge" or something.

10:11.072 --> 10:13.563
- "Fiddlesticks" too strong?
- Depends.

10:13.741 --> 10:16.030
Don't you worry
about your automobile, doc.

10:16.202 --> 10:19.949
I always wanted an excuse
to buy me a set of metric tools.

10:20.122 --> 10:23.205
Sh... Sugar.

10:47.436 --> 10:48.978
Hey.

10:51.022 --> 10:52.564
I'm Dr. Benjamin Stone.

10:52.732 --> 10:56.515
Nurse Packer. I'm assuming
Judge Evans told you.

10:58.445 --> 11:00.319
Fine. Here's what I need.

11:00.489 --> 11:04.651
Comfortable bed, hot shower,
warm meal, locker to put my stuff in...

11:04.826 --> 11:07.577
Could you show me some kind
of identification, please?

11:15.793 --> 11:19.161
I'm wearing glasses there.
I wear contacts now.

11:19.880 --> 11:22.121
My hair's a little shorter.

11:25.468 --> 11:29.168
That's a moustache.
It's a bad picture.

11:29.346 --> 11:32.928
If you could direct me to the physician
on call tonight, I'll speak to him.

11:35.977 --> 11:37.435
"When to call me:

11:37.603 --> 11:41.682
If you've been stabbed, shot, poisoned,
separated from an appendage...

11:41.856 --> 11:45.023
...knocked or beaten unconscious,
run over by a tractor, mower...

11:45.193 --> 11:48.526
...or generally about to bleed to death.
Otherwise, leave me alone."

11:48.695 --> 11:53.155
Signed,
Dr. Aurelius Edsel Hogue, M.D.

11:55.743 --> 11:58.031
<i>I'm in The Twilight Zone.</i>

12:00.372 --> 12:03.871
Zwieback and vitamin C
in the upper cabinet if you're hungry.

12:04.042 --> 12:07.706
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This is the best you can do?

12:07.962 --> 12:09.621
No.

12:25.434 --> 12:29.134
Oh, good, you're awake. Welcome
to Grady. I'm Mayor Nicholson.

12:29.313 --> 12:31.720
The second I heard
a big-city doctor was in town...

12:31.898 --> 12:34.815
...I left that rehearsal,
hightailed it over here...

12:34.984 --> 12:37.272
...see if I can make you
more comfortable.

12:37.445 --> 12:39.651
- We can do better than this.
- Better than this?

12:39.821 --> 12:41.814
Say, these your duffles?

12:42.490 --> 12:46.570
I'm not claiming that Grady's no Paris,
France, but we got two gas stations...

12:46.744 --> 12:49.495
...got us a Winn-Dixie, got us cable TV.
Like tennis?

12:49.663 --> 12:53.411
We got a new tennis court at the high
school. You doctors play golf, though.

12:53.583 --> 12:56.204
- Learning how to surf, actually.
- Isn't this pretty?

12:56.377 --> 12:59.876
We had this fixed up for a doctor
we got through the want ads years ago.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.620
- No one's been in it for a while.
- Mayor Nicholson.

13:02.799 --> 13:06.250
I'm on my way to California.
Don't be thinking I'm staying here.

13:06.427 --> 13:08.799
No, no, of course not.

13:08.971 --> 13:11.378
Well, maybe not.
Give old Grady a chance...

13:11.556 --> 13:14.094
...she might sneak up on you
like a bee in a bottle.

13:18.771 --> 13:20.099
Surprise!

13:20.272 --> 13:22.727
- Welcoming committee.
- I hope you're hungry.

13:23.858 --> 13:25.317
Evening, ladies.

13:25.485 --> 13:29.316
Ben Stone, this here is Miss Violet
and Miss Lillian and Miss Maddie.

13:29.488 --> 13:32.821
Ladies, this here is Ben Stone, M.D.

13:32.991 --> 13:36.940
Fried chicken, boiled peanuts
and sweet potato pie.

13:37.119 --> 13:41.662
Catfish, biscuits, butter beans
and watermelon.

13:41.832 --> 13:44.951
Hungry-Man dinner. I'm a bad cook.

13:45.126 --> 13:49.289
Well, I guess I'll just say adieu
and come chauffeur you in the morning.

13:49.463 --> 13:51.455
No, wait, wait, wait. Come on.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.173
You can't leave me here...

13:53.341 --> 13:56.092
...in the middle of nowhere with them.
It's getting late.

13:56.260 --> 14:00.008
Don't worry. Only one of them horny.
I'm not telling you which one.

14:00.180 --> 14:02.256
Your face.

14:08.979 --> 14:11.386
You want a cocktail?

14:12.190 --> 14:16.602
So anyway, the high-profile,
high-profit work...

14:16.777 --> 14:19.813
...just makes it possible for me
to do the more important...

14:19.988 --> 14:23.688
...reconstructive surgery
for needier patients.

14:24.617 --> 14:26.989
And get a big house on the beach.

14:27.161 --> 14:31.739
It's hard to believe. A man as good-
looking as Dr. Stone should be married.

14:31.915 --> 14:34.038
Maybe he ain't found
his Adam's rib yet.

14:34.209 --> 14:38.206
Maybe he indulges in the love
that dare not speak its name.

14:38.379 --> 14:40.869
- Lillian.
- Will I go blind?

14:42.174 --> 14:45.423
- It's moonshine, right?
- Well, ouzo, actually.

14:45.593 --> 14:48.962
- We took a cruise to Greece.
- Not me. I wasn't invited.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.972
It was one of those
golden-agers tours.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.133
Sunset Tours, honey.

14:54.309 --> 14:57.262
- They ate the brains out of a goat.
- Not me.

14:57.436 --> 14:59.761
- We ate dog.
- I didn't eat no dog.

14:59.938 --> 15:02.856
You don't know that you didn't.

15:03.191 --> 15:06.725
Dr. Stone, there's a legend
about friendship quilts.

15:06.903 --> 15:08.527
That's bunk.

15:08.696 --> 15:13.404
Folks say that the first person
to sleep under a friendship quilt...

15:13.575 --> 15:16.279
...will meet the one
they're gonna marry.

15:16.452 --> 15:19.572
Dream about the one they're
gonna marry, and it's bunk.

15:19.747 --> 15:22.949
What a fine hand he has.

15:23.833 --> 15:25.707
Dr. Stone?

15:26.753 --> 15:28.496
Dr. Stone?

16:42.232 --> 16:44.438
Oh, God.

17:07.086 --> 17:08.746
Hello.

17:10.589 --> 17:11.916
Hi.

17:12.758 --> 17:15.509
- Good morning.
- Is something wrong?

17:15.676 --> 17:17.964
No, no, no.

17:18.846 --> 17:20.554
I'm a doctor.

17:20.723 --> 17:23.213
Yeah, I know who you are.

17:25.185 --> 17:29.478
Hey, I'm sorry. Would you...?
Do you want this?

17:29.647 --> 17:33.644
If you're a doctor, I don't have
anything you haven't seen before.

17:44.201 --> 17:46.442
You can blink now.

17:51.040 --> 17:54.538
All the boys from the state legislature
come here, do their recreating.

17:54.709 --> 17:58.160
Boy, can they litter. Presidents
come here during the fishing season.

17:58.337 --> 18:00.330
On purpose?

18:00.798 --> 18:03.964
One look at all this, Ben boy,
I'm sure you're saying to yourself:

18:04.134 --> 18:07.384
"I have come to Grady at the most
beautiful time of the year."

18:07.553 --> 18:10.720
But, boy, these dogwoods, azaleas,
when they blooming...

18:10.890 --> 18:14.721
...they can't hold a candle to the nuclear
explosion of color come fall.

18:14.893 --> 18:18.972
Nick, you're the mayor. You have
the authority to commute my sentence.

18:19.146 --> 18:20.724
Could you do that?

18:20.898 --> 18:23.934
I'll make it worth your while.
I get back to L.A., we could...

18:24.109 --> 18:26.860
Why on earth
would I wanna do that?

18:27.028 --> 18:30.527
How am I gonna convince you
to stay here if you're not here?

18:31.282 --> 18:34.982
We need a doctor, you need patients.

18:35.202 --> 18:39.448
Get off the interstate, Ben Stone.

18:39.956 --> 18:41.533
Right?

18:44.584 --> 18:48.083
Don't let the signs of prosperity and
urban sprawl in downtown scare you.

18:48.254 --> 18:50.412
We're still the same
sleepy little paradise...

18:50.589 --> 18:53.958
...that big-city shrinks recommend
for patients with nervous disorders.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.541
It's the calming effect
of Grady's natural ozone.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.424
Fact, there's a world-class
mental hospital up the road.

18:59.597 --> 19:00.925
That's a comforting thought.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.930
Ben Stone, do you like coffee?
If you like coffee, we won't go in here.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.345
- Is that him?
- That's him.

19:08.521 --> 19:11.806
- He's young, huh?
- Come on, let's go.

19:14.526 --> 19:16.981
Boys, this here is Ben Stone...

19:17.153 --> 19:20.273
...a Hollywood physician
who's gonna spend a few days with us.

19:20.448 --> 19:24.694
Ben, this is Mortimer, John, Aubrey.
Probably don't want to shake his hand.

19:24.868 --> 19:27.868
Sorty in the corner.
Sorty got a cow that sings.

19:28.037 --> 19:31.620
- You remember Cotton, Miss Lillian.
- Hollywood. La-la land.

19:31.957 --> 19:33.617
- Beverly Hills, actually.
- Whatever.

19:33.792 --> 19:37.659
- Well, William's been a movie star.
- It was just an Army training film.

19:37.837 --> 19:40.506
Come now, you were the star.
You played the lead role.

19:40.673 --> 19:44.836
It was about VD. I was the bacteria.
Had a big scene with penicillin.

19:45.260 --> 19:47.632
Yes, a death scene.

19:47.804 --> 19:50.508
Take a load off, doctor.
This will stop your worries.

19:50.681 --> 19:52.590
Or start them.

19:54.059 --> 19:55.767
So, what do you think of our town?

19:55.936 --> 19:58.509
- I haven't seen all of it yet.
- Yeah, you have.

19:59.689 --> 20:01.064
Opportunity abounds here.

20:01.232 --> 20:03.557
Growth rate was up.3 percent
last year.

20:03.734 --> 20:06.687
- There's no crime.
- By the way, we are the county seat.

20:06.861 --> 20:10.811
Fellas, no point in beating a dead horse
to death. That's all in the brochure.

20:10.990 --> 20:15.402
Ben Stone, we are prepared
to offer you a permanent position...

20:15.577 --> 20:19.076
...as medical practitioner supreme
in the Grady metropolitan area...

20:19.247 --> 20:21.488
...the squash capital of the South.

20:21.665 --> 20:24.832
The salary's $27,000 per annum,
and plus housing.

20:25.836 --> 20:27.460
Twenty-seven thousand?

20:27.629 --> 20:31.246
- You see, Nick, I told you...
- Hold on. Thirty thousand.

20:32.174 --> 20:34.925
Look, you people don't even know me.

20:35.093 --> 20:37.762
I noticed right off that he
double-knots his shoelaces.

20:37.929 --> 20:40.550
- Excellent credentials.
- Shows he's careful.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.096
Anyway, don't you already have
a doctor?

20:43.267 --> 20:45.176
We got Hogue.
The problem with Hogue is...

20:45.352 --> 20:47.843
- He's old.
- Old and wholly unpleasant.

20:48.021 --> 20:50.179
Point is, he's not going
to be around forever.

20:50.398 --> 20:51.726
Thirty-five thousand?

20:51.899 --> 20:54.983
But that would take a unanimous vote
of the whole city council.

20:55.152 --> 20:57.191
- All in favor say, "Aye."
- Aye.

20:57.362 --> 20:59.734
- I abstain.
- You always abstain.

20:59.906 --> 21:03.903
Look, I appreciate your problem...

21:04.076 --> 21:06.115
...but I'm not the answer.

21:06.286 --> 21:08.658
I got a big job interview
on the West Coast.

21:08.830 --> 21:12.494
It's very important I get there in the
next couple of days. Plastic surgery.

21:12.666 --> 21:16.877
The truth is, they can probably pay me
about 20 times what you can afford.

21:17.045 --> 21:19.962
There's a lot of similarities
between Grady and Los Angeles.

21:20.131 --> 21:21.755
They're just bigger, is all.

21:22.633 --> 21:24.376
- What do I owe you?
- Ten bucks.

21:24.551 --> 21:27.220
- Ten bucks for coffee and toast?
- Got you.

21:27.387 --> 21:30.138
Tell you what, why don't you wait
to make up your mind...

21:30.306 --> 21:32.215
...till after the squash festival, huh?

21:32.391 --> 21:36.803
All I'm saying, Ben Stone, is give Grady
a chance. I bet you'll like her.

21:38.396 --> 21:42.524
Yeah, well, nice meeting you all.

21:42.691 --> 21:44.435
Thanks.

21:53.826 --> 21:57.028
- Howdy, nurse. How you doing?
- Doctor's lounge is down the hall.

21:57.204 --> 22:02.197
You can change in there, then Lou will
show you around. This is your time card.

22:03.834 --> 22:06.407
You gotta be kidding.

22:14.009 --> 22:17.627
- Local call?
- I don't know anybody local.

22:17.846 --> 22:20.633
Pay phone's in the waiting room.

22:23.058 --> 22:28.597
Yeah, it's... No, it's a collect call
from Dr. Benjamin Stone.

22:28.772 --> 22:30.479
Stone.

22:30.648 --> 22:32.356
Come on, do you mind?
This is a...

22:33.526 --> 22:36.941
...personal call.
- I guess so.

22:39.322 --> 22:44.030
Yeah, hi. Yes, this is Dr. Stone.
Actually, that's why I'm calling.

22:44.201 --> 22:46.870
I don't think I'm gonna be able
to make it on Tuesday.

22:47.037 --> 22:49.658
I just... There was a...

22:51.207 --> 22:53.579
A medical emergency in...

22:53.751 --> 22:56.751
They don't have a doctor,
so I volunteered my services.

22:56.920 --> 23:00.170
I'll need to stay
until the situation stabilizes.

23:00.340 --> 23:01.999
Yeah, medically speaking.

23:02.925 --> 23:05.380
You're interviewing other doctors?
Friday?

23:05.552 --> 23:10.213
Yeah, okay, Friday. I can do that. No,
thank you very much. And thank Doctor...

23:11.724 --> 23:15.555
<i>That was better tap-dancing
than I've seen on Star Search.</i>

23:17.687 --> 23:21.305
If you tell me you're here for
a physical, you're gonna make my day.

23:21.482 --> 23:24.234
It's unprofessional to flirt
with the patients.

23:24.401 --> 23:28.564
I'm just on my way to Beverly Hills.
Plastic surgery.

23:28.738 --> 23:30.565
Not that you need any.

23:30.740 --> 23:32.613
Nice try.

23:32.783 --> 23:36.483
<i>So is this the GQ look
for young urban doctors?</i>

23:37.537 --> 23:41.036
Well, I've spent the last two years
doing 18-hour days in the ER.

23:41.207 --> 23:44.622
I find these are pretty comfortable.

23:45.044 --> 23:46.953
You don't like them?

23:47.212 --> 23:48.836
No.

23:50.798 --> 23:54.381
Okay, fine. Well, I really enjoyed
our time together here...

23:54.552 --> 23:58.596
...but since you're obviously not a
patient, and I'm not getting anywhere...

23:58.763 --> 24:02.511
...tell me where I can find a guy named
Lou, drives an ambulance?

24:02.683 --> 24:04.426
I'm Lou.

24:13.901 --> 24:15.774
Where did all these people come from?

24:15.944 --> 24:19.194
Folks hear there's a doctor on duty,
they come running.

24:19.364 --> 24:21.855
Any old doctor.

24:24.660 --> 24:26.569
Send them in.

24:27.246 --> 24:30.412
Okay, Mr. Tidwell.

24:30.582 --> 24:33.119
What the hell have you got
on your foot?

24:33.292 --> 24:34.870
That's a poultice.

24:35.044 --> 24:38.957
- Nurse Packer!
- I got ahold to Doc Hogue on the CB...

24:39.130 --> 24:41.703
...and he said that that will hold me
till I came in.

24:41.883 --> 24:43.341
- You did this on purpose?
- Yes.

24:43.509 --> 24:46.712
It's chimney soot, biscuit flour
and lard. Doc Hogue said...

24:46.887 --> 24:52.225
Wipe that crap off Mr. Tidwell's foot,
please, and clean that wound out.

24:54.226 --> 24:57.809
- You allergic to penicillin?
- Don't know. Ask Doc Hogue.

24:57.980 --> 25:01.146
Doubt Doc Hogue knows
it's even been discovered.

25:01.774 --> 25:05.937
Okay. Nurse Packer,
I'm gonna wash this with Betadine...

25:06.111 --> 25:10.322
...close it with a butterfly,
give it a sterile dressing.

25:10.490 --> 25:13.325
You sure you ought to be doing that
so darned fast?

25:13.492 --> 25:15.615
I hope so, Mr. Tidwell...

25:15.786 --> 25:17.825
<i>...because je suis fini.</i>

25:22.750 --> 25:26.035
Okay, Mrs. Owens, if you could
please get up on the table...

25:26.211 --> 25:27.789
...put your feet in the stirrups.

25:35.386 --> 25:37.425
We're just here about our mail.

25:37.930 --> 25:41.713
It's from my sister. We don't read.

25:44.477 --> 25:48.640
- This ever happen before, Mr. McClary?
- Hell, yes. It happens.

25:48.814 --> 25:51.221
This ain't nearly the biggest one
I ever took.

25:51.399 --> 25:55.527
I had a hook in my thigh once.
It must have been, I'd say, like...

25:55.694 --> 25:57.936
Oh, excuse me, l... Yeah, well...

25:58.113 --> 26:01.612
- Fishing's a dangerous business.
- Well, it can be.

26:01.783 --> 26:07.950
"And after the cow died, there just
wasn't any reason for him to go on.

26:08.538 --> 26:12.405
Meanwhile, Ellen's got herself
mixed up with a Pakistani gentleman...

26:12.583 --> 26:15.999
...who nobody can understand
what he is saying.

26:16.587 --> 26:18.626
Not even Ellen."

26:18.922 --> 26:21.460
I don't see any toxic striations.

26:21.633 --> 26:23.127
Red streaks.

26:23.301 --> 26:25.922
You sure it was a black widow?

26:26.095 --> 26:30.423
Here. I kept it in some T.P.

26:32.058 --> 26:34.346
Oh, dear Lord, it's escaped.

26:36.604 --> 26:38.560
- There it is.
- Wait, there he goes.

26:38.730 --> 26:41.600
- Here he goes. Here he goes.
- Step on it.

26:41.775 --> 26:44.645
"She thinks Ray's having an affair
with the pastor's wife...

26:44.819 --> 26:48.187
...but Ray swears
it's his scrub-up rash."

26:48.864 --> 26:51.983
Ray is a nut, I'm telling you.

26:52.242 --> 26:55.692
It's like a blurred spot
in my vision.

26:55.870 --> 27:00.910
Out there. No. There. No.
No, there.

27:12.467 --> 27:14.589
I'm cured.

27:15.052 --> 27:19.299
"The pastor's wife got busted
for growing marijuana...

27:19.473 --> 27:21.382
...out behind the rectory.

27:21.558 --> 27:26.931
So she'll be spending a spell up in Tupelo
at the minimum-security prison."

27:29.648 --> 27:31.770
That's it?

27:33.026 --> 27:35.777
What about Ellen and the Pakistani?

27:45.911 --> 27:48.069
Nurse Packer? Nurse Packer.

27:48.247 --> 27:52.160
Where's Doc Hogue? The boy can't
breathe right, and he's turning blue.

27:52.333 --> 27:53.662
I'm the doctor here.

27:54.419 --> 27:56.790
Nurse Packer,
you've got to call Doc Hogue.

27:57.379 --> 28:00.664
- Please.
- It's all right. I'm the doctor.

28:01.800 --> 28:04.171
- How long has he been like this?
- All afternoon.

28:04.343 --> 28:05.921
- What's his name?
- Zeb.

28:06.095 --> 28:08.846
Hey, Zeb, this is going to be
a little cold, all right?

28:09.014 --> 28:11.302
I just wanna hear your heart.

28:12.475 --> 28:14.432
Does your tummy hurt?

28:15.102 --> 28:18.802
All right, take him down to the
examination room. I'll be right there.

28:18.981 --> 28:21.732
You know where that is?
Right there, okay?

28:21.900 --> 28:24.569
Have Zeb get up on the table for me.

28:26.612 --> 28:29.447
- Call Hogue. Get him here.
- He doesn't like to be disturbed.

28:29.615 --> 28:32.650
I really don't care. Forget Hogue.
What's the referral hospital?

28:32.826 --> 28:34.818
- Athens General.
- Call Athens General.

28:34.994 --> 28:38.279
We have a cardiac emergency.
Tell Lou to fire up the ambulance.

28:38.455 --> 28:41.372
No, forget it. They have a helicopter.
Tell them to send it.

28:41.541 --> 28:45.408
- Get me Zeb's medical history.
- I better call Dr. Hogue.

28:45.586 --> 28:49.204
Damn it. Listen to me,
Hogue is not here. I'm here.

28:49.381 --> 28:51.255
You do it.

28:58.347 --> 29:00.007
Here's the situation.

29:00.182 --> 29:03.467
Your son is turning blue
because he has an abnormal mitral valve.

29:03.643 --> 29:07.058
It's causing a back flow of blood in
his heart. We may have to operate.

29:07.229 --> 29:08.854
We'll send him to Athens General.

29:09.022 --> 29:11.727
Dr. Hogue said
you should give the boy a Coke.

29:11.900 --> 29:16.608
He says he's probably got a bellyache
and that you should give him a Coke.

29:19.656 --> 29:22.408
Listen, doctor, I've got a boy here
in cardiac crisis.

29:22.575 --> 29:26.619
You can't treat that with Coca-Cola or
Bisquick. We have to use real medicine.

29:26.787 --> 29:29.622
I'm sending him to Athens General.
You're his doctor...

29:29.790 --> 29:32.790
...so get your fat ass out of bed
and go with him!

29:34.794 --> 29:38.743
- How long will the chopper be?
- Should be here any minute.

29:51.933 --> 29:54.602
- Where's Stone?
- Dr. Hogue.

29:55.353 --> 29:59.017
What the hell kind of snot-nosed
puppy doctor are you anyway?

29:59.189 --> 30:02.439
Wake me up, scare these folks out
of their skivvies.

30:02.609 --> 30:04.850
Mitral valve regurge.

30:05.028 --> 30:09.190
I've had a lot of experience with it in ER.
I've even assisted in surgery to correct.

30:09.365 --> 30:13.278
God only knows how long he's had this,
but you overlooked it. Check his color.

30:13.451 --> 30:15.609
Nurse Packer,
get that crap off the boy.

30:16.037 --> 30:19.073
Gene, you gave him the
bismuth subnitrate, didn't you?

30:19.248 --> 30:22.082
- At first we thought...
- You gave him too much as usual.

30:23.126 --> 30:25.414
Turned him three shades of blue.

30:25.586 --> 30:28.871
- Bismuth subnitrate?
- Homegrown antacid.

30:29.048 --> 30:31.372
You hear a heart murmur?

30:31.550 --> 30:33.209
No, it's hard to detect.

30:33.385 --> 30:36.385
You been sampling
your daddy's chaw?

30:43.560 --> 30:45.219
That will be 65 cents.

30:49.398 --> 30:52.102
Well, nice work, Hollywood.

30:52.275 --> 30:55.027
You were about to open
the chest of a 6-year-old boy...

30:55.194 --> 30:59.274
...to cure a case of diarrhea.
Now, listen up, smart-ass.

30:59.448 --> 31:01.986
Next time I tell you
how to treat a patient of mine...

31:02.159 --> 31:05.029
...you better damn well do it, doctor.

31:05.203 --> 31:08.488
I doubt you'd know crap from Crisco.

31:18.923 --> 31:20.547
Hey.

31:22.759 --> 31:25.629
Yeah, right.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.676
Shit!

31:35.770 --> 31:38.557
Wait. Wait. Hold your horses, doc.

31:38.731 --> 31:42.479
Now, what if I walked in in the middle
of a hernia operation...

31:42.651 --> 31:45.735
...see some poor gentleman's guts
all over?

31:46.029 --> 31:48.400
- You killed my car.
- I resent that.

31:48.572 --> 31:51.608
That car was my life, Melvin.
That car was my baby.

31:51.783 --> 31:54.700
You want me to stop now?
I can put it in some boxes...

31:54.869 --> 31:58.072
...ship it out to Hollywood for you.
No skin off my nose.

31:58.247 --> 32:00.204
You and me called it
an oil pump casing.

32:00.374 --> 32:03.291
Lane had two years of the German
language in high school.

32:06.754 --> 32:08.912
Doc, let's step into my office.

32:11.800 --> 32:14.717
I don't need a car.
I'm moving to Los Angeles.

32:14.886 --> 32:17.840
- What do I need a car for?
- Lash yourself to the mast.

32:18.014 --> 32:21.464
Fella up in Oregon has an oil pump
he could air-express to us tomorrow.

32:21.642 --> 32:25.769
Two hundred thirty-nine bucks,
plus shipping. Only one problem.

32:25.979 --> 32:28.350
Oregon exploded.

32:28.522 --> 32:30.016
No.

32:30.566 --> 32:33.899
He don't take credit. Or checks.

32:34.069 --> 32:38.113
And tomorrow being Saturday,
you can't just wire some cash to him.

32:38.281 --> 32:41.198
Okay, Melvin, let me ask you this.

32:41.366 --> 32:44.865
How do you propose I pay for this?

32:45.036 --> 32:46.578
Well, I was hoping you'd pay me.

32:46.746 --> 32:50.957
Then I can trade him for a front rocker
assembly I got from a '68 Nova, but...

32:51.125 --> 32:54.956
- You don't take credit or checks.
- No, sir. I apologize.

32:55.128 --> 32:56.954
How long will this guy
in Oregon wait?

32:57.130 --> 33:00.083
I imagine I could stall him
till Sunday noon.

33:00.257 --> 33:04.835
Now, he got another taker in Arizona,
but I was first.

33:07.430 --> 33:09.173
Stall him.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.303
- Hi, doc.
- Hi, doc.

33:15.478 --> 33:19.012
- Morning, doc.
- Morning, Ben Stone.

33:19.190 --> 33:21.182
Howdy, y'all.

33:26.779 --> 33:30.479
- Dr. Stone. Dr. Stone, I presume.
- Yeah, that's right.

33:30.658 --> 33:32.116
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:32.284 --> 33:34.609
Say, you're much taller
than they said you were.

33:35.662 --> 33:38.331
I'm sitting on a stool.

33:39.540 --> 33:40.951
And you are?

33:41.125 --> 33:44.291
Dying to get out of this town.
How about you?

33:44.461 --> 33:46.667
- Here's your breakfast.
- I haven't ordered yet.

33:46.838 --> 33:50.040
Compliments of the house.
Don't let old Hogue scare you off.

33:50.216 --> 33:53.631
We know you weren't aiming
to kill that boy last night.

33:54.344 --> 33:57.048
Wait a minute, you're not planning
on staying in Grady?

33:57.221 --> 33:59.973
- Only as long as I have to.
- Thank God.

34:00.141 --> 34:02.892
For a second, I thought they got
their hooks into you too.

34:03.060 --> 34:06.558
- Wait, you don't like Grady?
- No.

34:06.896 --> 34:08.474
So how come you don't leave?

34:09.357 --> 34:10.732
With you?

34:12.359 --> 34:14.315
Is that a proposition, doctor?

34:15.654 --> 34:18.143
I better eat this before it's cold.
Nice meeting you.

34:18.322 --> 34:20.279
Thanks, Lillian.

34:26.704 --> 34:31.164
"Prosser on Torts." "Civil Procedure."
A little light reading this morning?

34:31.333 --> 34:32.827
Did I invite you to sit down?

34:33.001 --> 34:36.168
No, but you were going to.
Southern hospitality and all.

34:37.170 --> 34:39.661
- Now what?
- Now let's talk about you.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.757
Okay. I like my privacy.
I'm a vegetarian.

34:42.926 --> 34:46.425
I'd appreciate it if you'd take that slab
of ham to the counter with you.

34:46.596 --> 34:49.799
- It gives me the willies.
- I didn't order this slab.

34:49.974 --> 34:54.053
Now I suppose you'll say something cute
to stall your retreat.

34:54.226 --> 34:55.935
Maybe tell me about the big city...

34:56.103 --> 34:58.855
...all the things I'm missing
living in this dinky town...

34:59.023 --> 35:02.226
...and how you'd like to be the one
to take me out of it.

35:04.528 --> 35:07.149
Isn't that why you're going
to law school?

35:07.322 --> 35:09.693
You want to get out
of this dinky little town.

35:10.074 --> 35:14.403
I'm not going yet. And I plan to practice
in Grady when I'm through.

35:15.287 --> 35:17.956
Yeah, it looks like a hotbed
of legal activity.

35:18.122 --> 35:21.954
Well, malpractice for visiting young
surgeons seems promising.

35:22.376 --> 35:24.036
Who's the green apple, Vialula?

35:24.795 --> 35:27.250
- Henry, this is Ben Stone.
- Hey.

35:27.422 --> 35:29.829
Oh, yeah, the new croaker.

35:30.007 --> 35:31.501
Hank Gordon.

35:31.675 --> 35:33.004
You're in my chair.

35:34.803 --> 35:36.842
- Boyfriend?
- "Friend" friend.

35:47.147 --> 35:49.851
- Need any life insurance?
- What?

35:50.024 --> 35:53.274
You should be vested
in a term life program.

35:53.444 --> 35:55.815
Probably a quarter of a mil to start.

35:56.112 --> 35:58.685
Come by my office.
We could run a "what if."

35:58.990 --> 36:00.863
Or are you too chicken?

36:04.077 --> 36:07.031
I read somewhere doctors have
the highest suicide rate...

36:07.205 --> 36:09.197
...in any profession except dentistry.

36:09.373 --> 36:13.073
- Is that true?
- I won't underwrite dentists. Nope.

36:13.252 --> 36:16.371
Never trust a man who'll put his hand
in your mouth.

36:16.713 --> 36:19.998
Well, I'd love to stay and hear
where this conversation's headed...

36:20.174 --> 36:22.463
...but if you all will excuse me.

36:23.635 --> 36:26.838
There's something else
I wanted to ask you.

36:27.430 --> 36:32.175
Do doctors know more about sex
than normal people?

36:35.103 --> 36:37.772
I need some ketchup.

36:38.398 --> 36:40.935
I have a fair knowledge
of animal husbandry.

36:41.108 --> 36:43.350
It's all pretty much the same thing.

36:43.694 --> 36:45.104
- Bye, doc.
- Bye.

36:45.278 --> 36:47.851
Women trouble, Ben Stone?

36:48.531 --> 36:50.405
Squat here.

36:53.285 --> 36:56.488
- Regard the Grady squash.
- Looks like a yellow zucchini.

36:56.663 --> 37:01.538
Nope. See, up until 1933, you had your
Grady, you had your zucchini.

37:01.709 --> 37:03.535
They're going at it, gourd to gourd.

37:03.711 --> 37:07.245
Freak tornado accident wiped out
a whole shipment of Gradys...

37:07.422 --> 37:12.546
...bound for, I believe, agricultural
stardom at the Chicago World's Fair.

37:12.718 --> 37:14.924
The zucchini took there.
Never relented.

37:15.220 --> 37:19.217
If it had gone the other way, no telling
where this town would be today.

37:20.016 --> 37:21.723
What are you talking about?

37:22.434 --> 37:25.352
Timing. Same thing with women.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.556
And with Southern women,
they require substantial commitment.

37:28.731 --> 37:31.400
You might have to stay here
for six months, maybe more.

37:31.567 --> 37:35.267
- Are you a betting man, Nick?
- I have been known on occasion.

37:36.279 --> 37:38.355
- Take me about a week.
- Now, wait a minute.

37:38.531 --> 37:43.109
- You mean Vialula in the center pocket?
- Ten bucks.

37:45.370 --> 37:47.742
Okay, you got it.

37:48.915 --> 37:51.370
Feels like I'm fleecing you, Ben Stone.

37:54.253 --> 37:56.079
Easy.

37:59.007 --> 38:01.248
Hello, Nurse Packer.

38:04.011 --> 38:05.588
All right.

38:05.762 --> 38:08.383
Okay, let's get something straight
right now.

38:08.556 --> 38:13.348
I got eight years of higher education, one
year of internship, one year of residency.

38:13.519 --> 38:15.013
I'm $ 70,000 in debt.

38:15.187 --> 38:17.677
Now I'm waylaid in this heehaw hell...

38:17.856 --> 38:21.390
...and you insist on clocking me in
and out like I'm a factory worker.

38:21.567 --> 38:25.399
Well, no! N-O, no!
This is where I draw the line.

38:26.655 --> 38:29.739
I believe you have a visitor, doctor.

38:33.160 --> 38:37.821
Doc, my foot feels so good,
I brought you this pig.

38:41.250 --> 38:42.993
Okay.

38:43.169 --> 38:46.169
I can't abide being in no man's debt.

38:46.338 --> 38:48.710
This pig's all I got to give.

38:50.675 --> 38:53.545
I'm already paid, more or less,
by the hospital.

38:53.719 --> 38:57.586
- I really can't accept your pig.
- It's a done deal.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.846
She's your pig now.

39:02.018 --> 39:04.224
God bless you both.

39:10.191 --> 39:13.108
Keep your animal outside.
This is a hospital.

39:26.913 --> 39:29.238
- Nice pig there, doc.
- Thank you.

39:29.416 --> 39:32.250
- Lovely pig.
- Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

39:32.418 --> 39:35.786
- Nice pig, doc!
- Thank you.

39:35.963 --> 39:38.916
Thank you all very much.

39:45.179 --> 39:50.848
Ben Stone. Say, I think I just took away
your last reason to go to California.

39:51.017 --> 39:53.887
Norrisville Drum and Bugle Corps.

39:54.061 --> 39:56.267
They played last four years
in the Rose Parade.

39:56.438 --> 39:59.937
I got them under exclusive contract
to the Grady Squash Festival.

40:00.108 --> 40:01.566
I'm not staying.

40:01.984 --> 40:03.443
Sure, you aren't.

40:03.611 --> 40:06.730
Oh, by the way, dinner at my house
tomorrow night, 6:00.

40:06.947 --> 40:08.489
- Dinner?
- Didn't I tell you?

40:08.657 --> 40:09.985
You're guest of honor.

40:10.950 --> 40:14.484
Shoot a monkey. If my head wasn't
attached, I'd need wood screws.

40:14.662 --> 40:16.239
- Nice pig, doc.
- Thanks.

40:16.413 --> 40:18.619
Can I bring a date?

40:18.790 --> 40:21.459
Well, I don't know. Can you?

40:23.669 --> 40:27.536
This is Ben Stone you're talking to.
Come on, pig.

40:29.049 --> 40:31.337
Fine pig, doc.

40:36.221 --> 40:37.384
Melvin.

40:38.014 --> 40:41.299
Melvin. Melvin.

40:41.517 --> 40:45.052
Hey, doc. We're just rehearsing
for the pageant.

40:45.229 --> 40:48.597
We doing a pollination rap song.

40:51.734 --> 40:53.062
Melvin, listen.

40:53.236 --> 40:57.695
I don't have the money
for the oil-gepumpkin-hausen thing.

40:59.908 --> 41:03.905
I mean, when I say I haven't got
the money, that's not entirely true.

41:04.078 --> 41:05.987
I have the money.
I'm good for the money.

41:06.163 --> 41:09.199
It's just a matter of accessing
the money in a period of time.

41:09.374 --> 41:12.125
Can we work something out, please?

41:12.293 --> 41:15.329
This car has got to be ready
by the time I leave.

41:18.715 --> 41:21.881
- That your pig?
- Yeah.

41:29.849 --> 41:33.929
You want to trade? Pig for the part?

41:34.728 --> 41:36.887
If you can part with the pig.

41:39.983 --> 41:41.014
Good.

41:46.321 --> 41:48.859
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:53.995 --> 41:57.280
- You just pick those?
- Yes, ma'am.

41:58.123 --> 42:01.538
They're protected by law.
State flowers.

42:04.128 --> 42:05.871
Figures.

42:06.297 --> 42:10.590
I'm already serving time for the fence.
May as well take my chances, right?

42:10.759 --> 42:15.171
Mama. Mama, who is it?
Who are you?

42:18.598 --> 42:20.390
I'm Ben.

42:21.684 --> 42:24.222
Emma, take these inside
and put them in some water.

42:24.395 --> 42:26.886
You're not supposed to pick these.

42:27.231 --> 42:29.140
Use the plastic pitcher.

42:31.818 --> 42:33.810
Yeah, she's mine.

42:33.986 --> 42:36.773
She's 4. You wanna retreat now or...?

42:36.947 --> 42:38.571
No, no, no.

42:38.740 --> 42:41.527
No. Actually, I just came by...

42:41.701 --> 42:45.200
...because I need a date for dinner
tomorrow night.

42:45.371 --> 42:48.371
- Nick Nicholson's?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

42:48.707 --> 42:52.158
Can't poop in this town without
everyone knowing what color it is.

42:59.091 --> 43:02.506
I was fixing to have a cocktail.

43:02.719 --> 43:04.545
Are you in a hurry?

43:07.139 --> 43:09.215
Oh, man, that's tart.

43:09.391 --> 43:13.518
It's called a " Slow Comfortable Screw
Up Against a Wall," with a twist.

43:13.686 --> 43:16.722
- Is that a Grady specialty?
- No.

43:16.897 --> 43:19.352
- New York City.
- New York?

43:19.524 --> 43:22.809
Yeah. I worked at one of those
weirdo theme bars on the West Side.

43:22.986 --> 43:25.690
Wayne and I went to college
in New York.

43:26.405 --> 43:28.196
Then he dropped out.

43:28.365 --> 43:32.362
I got pregnant.
He couldn't get work, so I bartended.

43:32.535 --> 43:34.990
I managed to finish school, though.

43:35.162 --> 43:37.735
- Wayne isn't still...?
- Wayne...

43:37.915 --> 43:41.034
...is a professional dancer.

43:41.209 --> 43:43.248
One of those
exotic Chippendale things.

43:43.419 --> 43:46.870
He's in Boston, Miami...
I can't keep track.

43:47.298 --> 43:49.622
He left me after Emma was born.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.835
I divorced him
and came running back here.

43:53.261 --> 43:58.467
Wayne has this extremely high opinion
of his legs.

43:58.640 --> 44:01.345
You know, I just can't picture you
in the big city.

44:01.518 --> 44:03.344
New York.

44:03.686 --> 44:05.228
It's like me...

44:05.396 --> 44:07.803
- In Grady?
- Yeah.

44:08.857 --> 44:11.478
Well, peel an onion,
there's lots of layers.

44:13.528 --> 44:15.070
What layer is Hank on?

44:16.363 --> 44:19.364
Henry Gordon's sweet on me.

44:19.908 --> 44:21.817
And he's pretty decent and solid...

44:21.993 --> 44:25.492
...once you get past the " Insurance
Rebel Without a Clause" routine.

44:26.163 --> 44:28.369
Decent and solid.

44:28.916 --> 44:30.244
Very romantic.

44:33.169 --> 44:38.210
I can see you coming from half a mile
away, Dr. Stone.

44:38.382 --> 44:40.623
You and your slick city ways.

44:40.801 --> 44:42.592
I suspect your version of romance...

44:42.760 --> 44:45.796
...is whatever will separate me
from my panties.

44:47.389 --> 44:50.972
Look, all I'm talking about is dinner.

44:51.142 --> 44:53.894
In public. Wear a dress.

44:54.062 --> 44:56.303
Panties are optional.

44:57.731 --> 45:01.775
Well, I never have had dinner
at the mayor's house.

45:01.943 --> 45:04.066
Oh, boy.

45:04.695 --> 45:07.981
And after all,
how could I possibly refuse the man...

45:08.157 --> 45:10.398
...who saved Jasmine
from the butcher?

45:11.868 --> 45:15.319
- What are you talking about?
- Tidwell's pig.

45:15.496 --> 45:17.702
He was about to sell her
for pork chops...

45:17.873 --> 45:20.874
...if you hadn't fixed his foot,
made him feel guilty.

45:21.042 --> 45:24.541
Emma loves pigs.
You keeping her over at your house?

45:31.510 --> 45:33.253
Lane, where's Melvin?

45:33.595 --> 45:37.010
Where's Melvin? I want my pig back.

45:39.349 --> 45:42.220
Did you say he went to church?
At this hour?

45:44.729 --> 45:49.224
Are you allowed to come out here?
I can't understand what you're saying.

45:49.399 --> 45:52.898
Melvin's gone to church.
He's gone to Tylerville.

45:53.069 --> 45:55.560
The pig got took to the butcher.

45:56.364 --> 45:58.652
Melvin took my pig to the butcher.

45:59.450 --> 46:01.074
What?

46:09.291 --> 46:11.746
Mr. Crawford, where's my pig?

46:11.918 --> 46:14.623
You know, Jasmine, my pig.
Is she still alive?

46:14.796 --> 46:17.369
- Yes. She's in back.
- Thank God. Thank God.

46:17.548 --> 46:19.873
- I want her back.
- Doc...

46:20.050 --> 46:22.671
I know what you're going to say.
Do you take plastic?

46:22.844 --> 46:25.548
Not unless it's wrapped around
a stack of cash.

46:25.721 --> 46:27.513
Maybe we can work it out in trade.

46:27.681 --> 46:31.014
I don't know. I ain't been sick
in three years, doc.

46:31.810 --> 46:34.098
I got an idea.

46:41.943 --> 46:46.569
Where'd you learn to carve like that?
You're pretty darn good with a knife.

46:51.827 --> 46:53.866
- Hey, Maddie. Hey, Emma.
- Hi, doc.

46:54.037 --> 46:56.741
You guys are pig-sitting
for me tonight?

46:56.914 --> 46:58.408
Hey, Jasmine.

46:58.582 --> 47:00.207
- Who are you?
- Don't tease me.

47:00.375 --> 47:02.498
I'm serious.
You look like Lou, but prettier.

47:02.669 --> 47:06.251
I'm warning you, Stone, I could
probably whoop you in a fistfight.

47:06.422 --> 47:09.588
- Be a good girl.
- Bye.

47:09.758 --> 47:11.466
- Be a good girl.
- We'll be late.

47:11.635 --> 47:15.584
Not too much TV for her.
She's a real pig about that.

47:19.641 --> 47:24.801
Hi. Come on in. Welcome.
You look fantastic.

47:24.979 --> 47:26.722
- And you look handsome too.
- Thanks.

47:26.898 --> 47:29.981
Daddy's in the back yard tending
the firestorm in the barbecue.

47:30.150 --> 47:34.562
- So you're Nick's daughter.
- Gosh, I hope so, I'm in his will.

47:34.737 --> 47:37.228
Hey, y'all, look who's here.

47:37.907 --> 47:40.065
Hello, Lou. Hello, Stone.

47:40.242 --> 47:42.069
Check Hollywood for knives.

47:42.244 --> 47:46.869
I don't want him operating on me later
in case I sneeze or something.

47:47.957 --> 47:50.163
Isn't this gonna be fun?

47:52.002 --> 47:56.213
- Oh, no, thank you, I'm a vegetarian.
- I know, dear, but I'm still hopeful.

47:56.380 --> 47:58.871
So am I. Vegetarian.

47:59.049 --> 48:01.754
- Since when?
- Then have some of this squash, Ben.

48:01.927 --> 48:03.504
Flesh of the earth. Don't be shy.

48:03.678 --> 48:06.881
I'm not sure I trust a man
who doesn't eat meat.

48:07.056 --> 48:10.804
Don't be so provincial.
Where's your sense of adventure?

48:10.976 --> 48:15.637
I'd probably give vegetarians a better rate
for life insurance than a smoker, though.

48:15.813 --> 48:18.565
On account of that
lower cholesterol factor.

48:18.732 --> 48:23.061
Daddy, please, new subject.
We wanna hear all about California.

48:23.236 --> 48:26.106
I heard the women out there
have their chests enlarged...

48:26.280 --> 48:29.483
...their thighs vacuumed
and barf on purpose.

48:29.658 --> 48:31.781
Not while people are eating.

48:31.952 --> 48:35.320
Yeah, tell us about
real doctoring, Stone.

48:35.496 --> 48:38.201
You know, big-city medicine.

48:38.374 --> 48:42.074
So much has changed in the 40 years
since you went to medical school...

48:42.252 --> 48:43.912
...I wouldn't know where to start.

48:45.380 --> 48:47.455
- Smart-ass.
- Got you good.

48:47.965 --> 48:50.835
- More squash, Ben?
- No. I mean, no, thank you.

48:51.635 --> 48:56.841
<i>Out of the cradle
Endlessly rocking</i>

48:57.014 --> 49:00.465
<i>Out of the mockingbird's throat</i>

49:00.642 --> 49:03.429
<i>The musical shuttle</i>

49:03.603 --> 49:05.679
<i>Out of the ninth month</i>

49:05.855 --> 49:08.772
- Is this one of the long ones?
- No.

49:10.442 --> 49:12.233
Long ones?

49:12.903 --> 49:15.274
Doc Hogue does the complete
Walt Whitman...

49:15.447 --> 49:17.854
...if you don't monitor his drinking.

49:18.032 --> 49:21.614
<i>Down from the shower'd halo</i>

49:21.785 --> 49:25.865
<i>Up from the mystical play of shadows</i>

49:28.791 --> 49:32.159
Man, I haven't seen
this many stars in a long time.

49:32.628 --> 49:36.292
I used to get so bored in this town,
I'd try to count them.

49:36.631 --> 49:38.623
I could've gone to med school.

49:38.799 --> 49:42.713
Just the science part of it
I had a problem with.

49:42.886 --> 49:44.795
I'd lie on my back,
sometimes Wayne...

49:44.971 --> 49:47.343
...would be on top of me
doing the wild thing.

49:47.515 --> 49:50.718
- It was hard not to lose my place.
- God, that's romantic.

49:50.893 --> 49:52.470
Then we moved to Manhattan...

49:52.811 --> 49:55.480
...you could hardly see any stars,
let alone count them.

49:55.647 --> 49:58.683
The stars I'd like to see
are more of the two-legged kind.

49:58.858 --> 50:01.183
Earthquake insurance
is something I'm keen...

50:01.360 --> 50:03.352
...to take a whack at out there in L.A.

50:03.528 --> 50:05.651
Talk about your no-brainer.

50:05.822 --> 50:10.033
Collect premiums for a gazillion years,
and if the big one ever does hit...

50:10.201 --> 50:13.201
...declare bankruptcy and retire.

50:14.913 --> 50:17.866
- Decent and solid.
- Nobody's perfect.

50:18.040 --> 50:20.198
Hank, you gotta take Hogue home.

50:20.376 --> 50:22.783
He's about to launch
into "Song of Myself."

50:22.961 --> 50:24.835
My Lord.

50:25.297 --> 50:28.048
Never a dull moment,
hey, Ben Stone?

50:28.216 --> 50:30.089
I'll call you later.

50:30.467 --> 50:32.175
Make sure you got home okay.

50:50.109 --> 50:52.682
- Good night.
- Night.

51:28.099 --> 51:31.218
- I forgot my pig.
- She's sleeping with Em.

51:31.393 --> 51:33.884
I'll drop her off in the morning.

51:34.312 --> 51:37.396
Greek death? Take the edge off.

51:37.565 --> 51:39.854
Take the edge off what?

51:41.360 --> 51:43.020
Me.

51:45.822 --> 51:50.946
- You ran all the way over here.
- Oh, yeah. I ran and...

51:51.118 --> 51:53.787
...walked. Got a stitch in my side.

51:53.954 --> 51:56.076
Why are you giving me
the full-court press...

51:56.247 --> 51:59.367
...if you're only leaving
in a couple of days anyway?

52:00.001 --> 52:01.660
You know, I don't know.

52:01.835 --> 52:06.960
It's like it's some kind
of mystical force.

52:07.132 --> 52:09.705
Force or hormones?

52:10.217 --> 52:12.459
Hey, come on.

52:12.636 --> 52:14.842
All I wanna do is talk.

52:17.182 --> 52:19.755
And get you sloppy drunk.

52:20.476 --> 52:22.267
Honesty. That's a new approach.

52:22.436 --> 52:27.512
I know. You're forcing me
into uncharted territory here.

52:28.441 --> 52:31.311
Hell, I might even try chastity.

52:32.111 --> 52:34.780
Seems to work for Hank.

52:39.700 --> 52:41.858
Speak of the devil.

52:44.329 --> 52:47.994
Listen, maybe a rain check?

52:49.750 --> 52:53.166
I never should have accepted
those flowers.

52:58.216 --> 52:59.793
What about tomorrow night?

52:59.967 --> 53:02.672
Desperation. I like this.

53:04.221 --> 53:10.803
Still, I wouldn't want the mayor to have
to lose 10 bucks over me, you know?

53:31.535 --> 53:32.910
Morning.

53:35.705 --> 53:37.532
Funny. Funny.

53:42.044 --> 53:46.337
Morning, doc.
That's a nice pig you got there!

53:46.673 --> 53:48.630
Yeah, that's what they tell me.

53:48.800 --> 53:54.138
Hey, Mr. McClary, be careful you don't
get another hook in your finger!

53:54.304 --> 53:59.179
Don't worry, doc.
We're not using hooks today.

54:11.068 --> 54:13.559
It's all right. It's all right.

54:20.118 --> 54:24.280
- He's a nice pig, doc.
- It's a she, actually.

54:28.875 --> 54:31.081
Relax, will you?

54:32.461 --> 54:35.462
House calls are probably
my favorite part of the job.

54:35.631 --> 54:40.624
Just driving out into the country, seeing
what might pop up around the next bend.

54:41.385 --> 54:43.378
Rainbows.

54:43.637 --> 54:45.511
Frost on the kudzu.

54:46.264 --> 54:50.807
John Muir said it, " Most people
are on the world, not in it."

54:54.563 --> 54:55.891
What?

54:57.107 --> 54:58.933
Nothing.

55:01.736 --> 55:03.443
What?

55:16.915 --> 55:19.869
Listen, you better let me handle
this one alone.

55:20.043 --> 55:23.043
- Obstetrical exam.
- Okay.

55:24.004 --> 55:27.289
"So Jimmy Joe went over to
the Pakistani's house with a shotgun."

55:27.465 --> 55:30.916
Excuse me.
Jimmy Joe is Ellen's brother?

55:31.094 --> 55:33.252
No, no. Boyfriend.

55:33.804 --> 55:36.046
I was stumped on that one too.

55:36.223 --> 55:39.389
"He stayed outside shooting holes
in the fella's foreign car...

55:39.559 --> 55:42.512
...until Ellen came out and agreed
to come back home with him.

55:42.687 --> 55:46.020
It's the most romantic thing
Jimmy Joe has ever done for her."

55:52.028 --> 55:53.522
Tough one.

55:53.696 --> 55:57.278
How's Ellen making out
with the Pakistani man?

56:00.285 --> 56:01.862
Get him, get him. Come on, Bubba.

56:04.371 --> 56:08.203
I said... I said, no shots.

56:18.508 --> 56:20.382
This won't hurt.

56:20.551 --> 56:23.338
Well, I don't see an infection.

56:23.596 --> 56:25.387
But...

56:27.974 --> 56:30.132
Okay, hold still.

56:34.396 --> 56:37.065
- What is that, a V8?
- He did it.

56:39.651 --> 56:43.315
You know, house calls used to be
essential to every doctor's practice.

56:43.487 --> 56:46.523
The only way to know your patients
was to see where they live.

56:46.698 --> 56:48.774
How they lived.

56:49.492 --> 56:51.235
Maybe when I get to Halberstrom's...

56:51.411 --> 56:54.446
...I'll get them to institute some kind
of visitation program.

56:54.622 --> 56:55.950
Damn it.

57:00.585 --> 57:02.293
Lou?

57:05.631 --> 57:07.255
Hey, Lou!

57:10.843 --> 57:13.548
Do you see another one?
They mark their way with these.

57:13.721 --> 57:17.765
They're too stupid or too drunk to
remember where they were most times.

57:17.933 --> 57:20.470
- Who?
- Hunters.

57:21.144 --> 57:24.393
Maybe this is the end of...
Yeah. See, there it is.

57:24.563 --> 57:27.018
That's where they sit
and wait for the slaughter.

57:27.190 --> 57:31.602
It's not like they do it for food either.
God, it gets me so hot.

57:36.657 --> 57:38.982
You wanna help me here?

57:39.492 --> 57:40.903
What are you doing?

57:41.869 --> 57:43.328
I'm urinating.

57:44.788 --> 57:47.742
You just drop trou
whenever you feel like it.

57:47.916 --> 57:51.913
Well, it scares the deer away
so the hunters won't get them.

57:53.879 --> 57:56.631
Why don't you just, you know,
say "boo" or something?

57:56.799 --> 58:00.630
I try to spread it around.
A little here, a little there.

58:02.261 --> 58:04.633
Feel free to join in.

58:27.366 --> 58:31.197
Anyway, it's not like I planned
to be pregnant at 19...

58:31.369 --> 58:33.445
...but it could have been worse
than Wayne.

58:33.621 --> 58:35.779
Wendall Barnes.

58:35.956 --> 58:37.331
You'd be interested in him.

58:37.499 --> 58:40.702
He comes from a whole family
that doesn't have sweat glands.

58:40.877 --> 58:43.996
Really? I'm fascinated
by the gland-less.

58:44.171 --> 58:45.500
I guess it's genetic.

58:45.673 --> 58:49.171
During the summer, they all sleep under
the house on account of the heat.

58:49.342 --> 58:52.675
That's a touching story. Really.
Thanks for sharing that with me.

58:52.845 --> 58:56.593
You don't see a lot of things in Grady,
but what you do see, you see a lot of.

58:56.765 --> 58:58.804
Yeah, I'm from a small town myself.

58:59.267 --> 59:00.927
What?

59:02.395 --> 59:07.103
Marionville, Indiana.
Population: 2106.

59:07.274 --> 59:10.393
Home of the world's largest
steam engine.

59:10.902 --> 59:12.562
But you told everybody that you...

59:12.737 --> 59:16.604
No, no, no. Everybody assumed
I was a big-city guy.

59:16.782 --> 59:19.107
Nobody asked.

59:19.284 --> 59:21.905
Anyway, I got out,
and I'm staying out.

59:24.330 --> 59:26.951
Have you still got
your whole family there?

59:27.124 --> 59:29.531
Well, they talked about leaving...

59:29.709 --> 59:32.461
...but my dad never quite...

59:33.546 --> 59:35.834
They lived there, they died there.

59:36.006 --> 59:38.248
For better or for worse.

59:38.759 --> 59:43.135
So when I left home, I swore
to myself I was never going back.

59:44.096 --> 59:46.765
It's not the place, it's the person.

59:47.724 --> 59:50.974
Be careful what you wish for,
Ben Stone, you might get it.

59:51.186 --> 59:52.728
What's that supposed to mean?

59:52.895 --> 59:55.564
You never been back,
not even to see your friends?

59:55.731 --> 59:58.981
Well, who's got time for friends?

01:00:03.529 --> 01:00:06.898
<i>No, you gotta get Dr. Stone
back here ASAP.</i>

01:00:07.074 --> 01:00:09.232
<i>We got a possible
coronary emergency.</i>

01:00:09.409 --> 01:00:13.406
<i>- Can't Doc Hogue handle this?
- It is Hogue. Over.</i>

01:00:17.291 --> 01:00:19.746
- Hey, lie down.
- Oh, crap, I'm doomed.

01:00:20.127 --> 01:00:22.119
Lie down now.
You're having a heart attack.

01:00:22.295 --> 01:00:24.334
My angina's acting up is all.

01:00:24.505 --> 01:00:27.671
- Got any nitro pills down there?
- No, get a bolus of lidocaine.

01:00:27.841 --> 01:00:30.213
I'm the senior sawbones around here.

01:00:30.385 --> 01:00:33.754
PVCs are too close to your T-waves.
In 30 seconds, you're in trouble.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.388
Get him away from me.

01:00:35.556 --> 01:00:39.256
If I'm wrong, lidocaine won't hurt.
If you're wrong, it's a ventricular fib.

01:00:39.434 --> 01:00:41.059
I'm never wrong.

01:00:42.604 --> 01:00:45.059
Get the defibrillator over here.

01:00:45.314 --> 01:00:46.773
Never wrong.

01:00:46.982 --> 01:00:49.021
Four hundred watts.

01:00:49.318 --> 01:00:50.646
Clear. Clear!

01:00:53.279 --> 01:00:54.903
Heartbeat.

01:00:55.072 --> 01:00:58.441
- Sixty.
- Wow, you mean he actually has one.

01:00:58.617 --> 01:01:01.190
Keep him on oxygen
and set the lidocaine drip.

01:01:02.287 --> 01:01:04.279
Guess I'm staying here tonight.

01:01:17.675 --> 01:01:19.252
Oh, doctor.

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:21.751
I've got your bed ready.

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:25.513
Right.

01:01:29.685 --> 01:01:31.013
Sleep well, doctor.

01:01:39.443 --> 01:01:41.815
At which point, all the bees,
including Melvin...

01:01:41.987 --> 01:01:44.477
...lunged off the edge
of the stage like lemmings.

01:01:44.655 --> 01:01:47.526
- A standing ovation.
- Variations on a theme.

01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:49.110
Sorry I missed it.

01:01:49.284 --> 01:01:52.735
That's the first squash pageant
that I missed in 15 years.

01:01:52.912 --> 01:01:54.323
What's going on here?

01:01:54.497 --> 01:01:58.576
It's called moral support
for the recovering patient.

01:01:58.751 --> 01:02:00.244
Cherry cobbler, Ben?

01:02:00.419 --> 01:02:04.498
Everybody out. Let's go.
Come on, visiting hours are over.

01:02:04.672 --> 01:02:09.380
Don't mind Doc Hollywood. He doesn't
know what it means to be beloved.

01:02:11.261 --> 01:02:14.926
If you've come to clean the room,
my bedpan's ripe.

01:02:19.643 --> 01:02:22.976
Oh, no.
Not Maddie's sweet potato pie.

01:02:23.146 --> 01:02:25.815
You can razz me all you want, doc.

01:02:26.274 --> 01:02:29.025
I saved your life last night.

01:02:29.276 --> 01:02:32.230
You know it, and I know it.

01:02:33.196 --> 01:02:34.987
Gotcha.

01:04:06.858 --> 01:04:10.024
Dr. Halberstrom, please.
It's Ben Stone calling.

01:04:10.903 --> 01:04:13.144
It's regarding...

01:04:13.697 --> 01:04:18.358
I'm not gonna be able to make
my interview on Friday.

01:04:18.951 --> 01:04:24.157
I realize the doctor has a tight schedule.
I'm not gonna be able to leave without...

01:04:26.207 --> 01:04:27.535
Right.

01:04:27.708 --> 01:04:31.788
Is there any way that he can reschedule
the appointment for another time?

01:04:32.546 --> 01:04:35.297
All right. Thanks a lot.

01:05:04.531 --> 01:05:07.981
Here you go. Get hot and take a shot.
Get hot and take a shot.

01:05:08.159 --> 01:05:09.818
What's the object of this one, pal?

01:05:09.994 --> 01:05:12.365
Ten shots a dollar.
Five bull's-eyes win a possum.

01:05:12.537 --> 01:05:16.155
- Suppose I was to hit five out of five.
- I'll give you two possums.

01:05:24.881 --> 01:05:29.626
Sir, run Henry a tab.
He feels deadly today.

01:05:32.012 --> 01:05:34.549
Evening, Dr. Stone.

01:05:47.733 --> 01:05:49.109
Hey, doc.

01:05:51.987 --> 01:05:55.153
The new one's in.
Your chariot's good as new.

01:05:55.323 --> 01:05:57.730
Or good as new used, since it's old.

01:05:57.909 --> 01:06:00.826
- You fixed my car?
- Even all the ashtrays.

01:06:00.994 --> 01:06:03.200
Oh, man, I can't believe this.

01:06:03.371 --> 01:06:04.700
Melvin, thanks, man.

01:06:06.958 --> 01:06:08.749
There's always some extra parts...

01:06:08.918 --> 01:06:11.325
...when I put them back together.
I don't know why.

01:06:11.503 --> 01:06:14.836
But you go ahead on. Keep them.

01:06:19.427 --> 01:06:21.668
- Dance with me or I'm dog food.
- What?

01:06:21.845 --> 01:06:25.214
- Wendall Barnes.
- Of the gland-less Barnes?

01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:27.715
- Jesus.
- Yeah. Come on.

01:06:27.892 --> 01:06:30.180
Absolutely.

01:06:45.532 --> 01:06:47.358
You see, the trick...

01:06:47.992 --> 01:06:52.155
...is just to visualize the target
on the backs of your eyeballs...

01:06:52.329 --> 01:06:57.286
...and then pretend you're just
shooting yourself in the eye.

01:07:04.798 --> 01:07:07.086
I can't keep up.

01:07:25.774 --> 01:07:27.481
How's Hogue?

01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:29.310
Meaner than ever.

01:07:36.324 --> 01:07:38.151
Dance?

01:07:44.414 --> 01:07:46.406
Where's Hank?

01:07:46.666 --> 01:07:48.575
I forget.

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.220
The music stopped.

01:09:53.772 --> 01:09:55.681
What music?

01:09:59.652 --> 01:10:01.443
Dr. Stone.

01:10:01.904 --> 01:10:05.107
- I have a present for you.
- Thanks, judge.

01:10:05.282 --> 01:10:09.195
I want to thank you for saving
my old friend Hogue's miserable life.

01:10:09.369 --> 01:10:11.657
I wouldn't be able
to call myself a Christian...

01:10:11.829 --> 01:10:14.616
...if I didn't pardon you
on the remainder of your sentence.

01:10:14.790 --> 01:10:16.829
You're free to go
whenever you want.

01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:19.206
What I wouldn't give to be young
on the road...

01:10:19.377 --> 01:10:22.212
...footloose and fancy-free.

01:10:22.379 --> 01:10:25.582
Did I tell you? I've already got plans
for a new fence.

01:10:25.757 --> 01:10:28.129
All of a sudden,
I got a bug in my ear...

01:10:28.301 --> 01:10:31.551
...for one of those solid-oak numbers
with curly tops.

01:10:34.014 --> 01:10:35.722
Victory.

01:10:35.891 --> 01:10:38.132
Did you kill that critter
all by yourself?

01:10:38.309 --> 01:10:39.803
Very funny.

01:10:39.977 --> 01:10:44.722
Don't you have some urgent business
thousands of miles away from here?

01:10:44.898 --> 01:10:48.895
Vialula, your daughter was dumping
grasshoppers in the punch bowl again.

01:10:49.068 --> 01:10:50.183
Only two.

01:10:50.361 --> 01:10:56.149
- Shake a leg with the judicial branch?
- Why, I'd love to. Thank you.

01:10:56.741 --> 01:10:58.200
Would you hold this possum?

01:10:58.368 --> 01:11:01.902
I think it's time I reacquainted
your mama with some real dancing.

01:11:02.079 --> 01:11:04.748
No offense, Hollywood.

01:11:10.503 --> 01:11:13.076
When you gonna bring
your pig back around?

01:11:22.596 --> 01:11:25.513
Hey there, Ben Stone.
Hey, how are you?

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:27.888
Been looking for you.
What a great day.

01:11:28.059 --> 01:11:30.632
Boy, this is it.

01:11:30.812 --> 01:11:34.227
The pinnacle of existence,
the grandeur of Grady.

01:11:34.398 --> 01:11:36.639
Sap of life.
Couldn't be happier if I was twins.

01:11:36.817 --> 01:11:40.766
- You put on a hell of a festival, mayor.
- Ain't you nice to say so.

01:11:40.945 --> 01:11:44.894
Ben, let's talk turkey.
Or squash, as it were.

01:11:45.073 --> 01:11:47.445
- About what?
- Home.

01:11:47.617 --> 01:11:48.945
Heart.

01:11:49.119 --> 01:11:50.660
Happiness.

01:11:50.828 --> 01:11:52.571
You belong here, Ben Stone.

01:11:52.747 --> 01:11:56.696
Breaks my heart to think of you
out there in the land of lunatics.

01:11:56.875 --> 01:12:00.243
I'm danged if I'll let you go
without holding up a mirror to your face.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:04.464
Like that smile of contentment there.
So you see that? See there?

01:12:04.631 --> 01:12:08.842
That's a face that's liked and loved.
A face with friends and a future.

01:12:09.010 --> 01:12:11.501
Can't find some other way
to force me to stay?

01:12:11.679 --> 01:12:13.054
Ben.

01:12:13.222 --> 01:12:15.095
I am everything but devious.

01:12:15.265 --> 01:12:18.800
Mayor, could you come check
these ribs and tell me if they're done?

01:12:18.977 --> 01:12:20.720
I sure can.

01:12:20.895 --> 01:12:23.101
Rigors of the job, huh?

01:12:23.522 --> 01:12:27.899
Well, you got your fire way too high,
I'll tell you that.

01:12:28.401 --> 01:12:29.776
Well, don't do that.

01:12:31.863 --> 01:12:34.946
Come on, come on.

01:12:37.492 --> 01:12:39.817
- Hi, doc.
- Gentlemen.

01:13:16.608 --> 01:13:18.897
Careful with those things.

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:39.705
I know I shouldn't be doing this because
you're leaving, but I don't care.

01:13:39.878 --> 01:13:41.787
I can't help it.

01:13:41.963 --> 01:13:43.622
So get in.

01:13:43.923 --> 01:13:47.967
- Do you mean what I think you mean?
- Just get in if you're gonna get in.

01:13:54.473 --> 01:13:57.308
Lou, I gotta be honest with you.

01:13:57.476 --> 01:14:00.346
Rowing a boat is not
what I had in mind.

01:14:04.732 --> 01:14:06.439
Not bad, huh?

01:14:09.861 --> 01:14:11.189
Incredible.

01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:15.402
- What was that?
- Freshwater mullet.

01:14:15.574 --> 01:14:19.820
They see the sparks from the skyrockets,
think it's food and jump for it.

01:14:19.994 --> 01:14:22.034
That's scary.

01:14:22.288 --> 01:14:24.327
Maybe I could...

01:14:24.832 --> 01:14:27.038
...sit next to you,
and you could protect me.

01:14:27.209 --> 01:14:29.331
No. You'll throw us off balance.

01:14:29.502 --> 01:14:31.744
I want you off balance.

01:14:31.921 --> 01:14:33.913
- He's in the boat!
- Hold still.

01:14:34.090 --> 01:14:36.082
- Get him.
- Watch it, you'll tip us over.

01:14:36.258 --> 01:14:38.416
- Get him, Lou.
- Okay, I got it.

01:14:43.222 --> 01:14:45.629
You did that on purpose.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.138
All right, I admit it.

01:14:49.603 --> 01:14:53.434
I worked my way through college
by training bass.

01:15:17.042 --> 01:15:18.417
Lou?

01:15:18.960 --> 01:15:20.869
It's okay.

01:15:21.713 --> 01:15:24.168
Listen, if you don't wanna...

01:15:24.715 --> 01:15:28.759
Ben, I don't think I've ever wanted
anything more in my entire life, ever.

01:15:29.469 --> 01:15:32.885
I'm just not used to being
a one-night stand.

01:15:35.599 --> 01:15:38.683
You don't have to be.
I mean, I could...

01:15:38.894 --> 01:15:42.558
No. I wouldn't know what to do
with myself in Los Angeles.

01:15:42.730 --> 01:15:45.268
There are too many choices.

01:15:46.817 --> 01:15:49.486
Let's not think about it, okay?

01:15:55.116 --> 01:15:57.274
I can't do this.

01:16:09.461 --> 01:16:14.087
Mind walking from here? I don't wanna
give the gossips any more fat to chew.

01:16:16.634 --> 01:16:18.377
Right.

01:16:19.219 --> 01:16:22.255
Don't worry, Benjamin,
it'll all work out.

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:43.855
Hey, Jasmine.

01:17:05.049 --> 01:17:06.626
Hey, Hank.

01:17:07.551 --> 01:17:11.251
You've made me real mad.

01:17:12.889 --> 01:17:14.431
About what?

01:17:14.599 --> 01:17:16.591
What do you think?

01:17:16.767 --> 01:17:19.970
I know you were out on that lake
with her.

01:17:20.228 --> 01:17:23.597
It makes me sick
to think of you and her.

01:17:23.773 --> 01:17:26.180
- Nothing happened.
- Oh, right.

01:17:26.358 --> 01:17:28.516
Nothing happened!

01:17:28.694 --> 01:17:30.852
Come on, tough guy!
Come on, country boy!

01:17:31.029 --> 01:17:33.780
You wanna take a shot at me, huh?
Come on!

01:17:33.948 --> 01:17:36.735
- What are you doing?
- Come on, country boy, get up! Let's go.

01:17:37.326 --> 01:17:38.950
Are you paranoid or something?

01:17:41.621 --> 01:17:43.245
No.

01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:46.281
But I'm a little confused.

01:17:54.424 --> 01:17:56.879
I suppose you and her
will be getting married now.

01:18:03.473 --> 01:18:05.548
It's the Southern way.

01:18:05.725 --> 01:18:08.429
Man and woman as one.

01:18:08.769 --> 01:18:14.224
Make sacrifices to build equity
in a future that has security.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.263
Why do you sound like
a Mutual of Omaha ad?

01:18:17.568 --> 01:18:19.607
Fine, joke it up.

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.984
At least I was prepared to marry her.

01:18:24.657 --> 01:18:26.199
She's not in love with you.

01:18:27.368 --> 01:18:30.072
Okay. That's the only
roadblock, though.

01:18:33.748 --> 01:18:35.787
Let me ask you something.

01:18:36.751 --> 01:18:40.617
Don't you think a guy is entitled
to choose his own destiny?

01:18:41.213 --> 01:18:43.917
Whether it's in a small town
or even in California.

01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:46.545
It's just that he shouldn't have it
handed to him.

01:18:46.717 --> 01:18:50.086
Not like it's a... You know, like...

01:18:50.262 --> 01:18:51.922
A hat?

01:18:54.015 --> 01:18:56.340
Right. Okay, good. Like a hat.

01:18:56.517 --> 01:18:59.802
Your father and your grandfather wore it,
now you're stuck with it.

01:18:59.978 --> 01:19:02.683
Only the damn thing is too small.
It just doesn't fit.

01:19:02.856 --> 01:19:08.098
- I hate a tight hat.
- There's a lot of hats out there.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:12.060
And even if this one fits...

01:19:12.239 --> 01:19:14.030
...and I'm not saying that it does...

01:19:14.198 --> 01:19:18.278
...how do you know it's the right one
when you haven't tried any others on?

01:19:18.452 --> 01:19:20.658
I sure haven't.

01:19:22.247 --> 01:19:24.654
I mean, that's what
I'm talking about.

01:19:25.750 --> 01:19:28.501
I just don't wanna screw up her life.

01:19:29.711 --> 01:19:31.834
You know, Hollywood...

01:19:32.005 --> 01:19:36.334
...sometimes a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

01:19:36.509 --> 01:19:41.419
And maybe...
Maybe it's in California.

01:19:43.473 --> 01:19:45.880
Yeah, maybe you're right.

01:19:47.101 --> 01:19:51.180
- Well, I'm glad we got that cleaned up.
- Me too, Hank.

01:19:51.355 --> 01:19:53.845
Don't that take the rag off the bush?

01:19:54.023 --> 01:19:56.395
Don't forget what I told you.

01:20:59.912 --> 01:21:01.240
Hey, please!

01:21:05.041 --> 01:21:07.033
Shit.

01:21:16.134 --> 01:21:18.090
Shit.

01:21:18.302 --> 01:21:20.010
Shit.

01:21:32.064 --> 01:21:33.855
Dr. Stone.

01:21:34.024 --> 01:21:36.146
Mary. Decided to drop by,
see how you were doing.

01:21:36.317 --> 01:21:40.480
No damn good. Water's broke. I hurt.
This ain't like none of the others.

01:21:40.654 --> 01:21:42.611
They never are.

01:21:43.615 --> 01:21:46.734
Did Doc Hogue tell you this baby
might come out the wrong way?

01:21:47.952 --> 01:21:50.656
He's coming.
He don't care which way.

01:21:52.331 --> 01:21:55.664
- Fiddlesticks. Don't push, Mary.
- I can run, get an ambulance.

01:21:55.833 --> 01:21:59.498
There's no time for that. Go into my
duffle bag, there's four clean shirts.

01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:02.540
Get them and rip them
into even pieces.

01:22:03.381 --> 01:22:07.248
Listen, Mary, don't push. I know
you want to, but don't push.

01:22:07.426 --> 01:22:09.964
I'll try to turn him around
so he comes the right way.

01:22:10.596 --> 01:22:12.553
Is it these ones?

01:22:12.723 --> 01:22:17.183
- "Aramana"?
- Armani. Those are the ones.

01:22:21.605 --> 01:22:25.519
Okay, now. Now! That's it.
Great. Great. Great.

01:22:25.692 --> 01:22:27.814
Okay, okay, okay.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:32.145
Now go! Push. Push, Mary.
You're doing great.

01:22:32.322 --> 01:22:34.445
You're doing great.

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:37.025
I got a leg. I got a leg.

01:22:45.166 --> 01:22:48.582
All right. Go ahead, go ahead.

01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:51.043
Someone's coming.

01:22:51.213 --> 01:22:54.249
Doc, someone's coming.

01:22:55.050 --> 01:22:57.006
Okay, all right.

01:23:01.805 --> 01:23:03.762
Push! Push, Mary!

01:23:13.648 --> 01:23:14.977
Doc, your car.

01:23:17.235 --> 01:23:18.812
What do I do?

01:23:20.196 --> 01:23:21.939
Okay.

01:23:23.156 --> 01:23:25.445
- Good girl!
- What do I do?

01:23:25.617 --> 01:23:26.945
Push, Mary.

01:23:31.038 --> 01:23:32.698
It's a girl!

01:24:07.944 --> 01:24:10.517
I think I can fix that.

01:24:25.792 --> 01:24:28.911
- You rang?
- First breech you ever delivered?

01:24:30.463 --> 01:24:32.751
First baby I ever delivered.

01:24:32.923 --> 01:24:34.251
By myself.

01:24:35.175 --> 01:24:37.748
- Whiskey?
- No, thanks.

01:24:37.927 --> 01:24:40.465
In fact, I wouldn't recommend that
for you, either.

01:24:40.638 --> 01:24:43.307
You're not my doctor,
and you're not my wife...

01:24:43.473 --> 01:24:46.557
...so I guess you don't have
very much to say about it.

01:24:48.978 --> 01:24:51.895
You're not fixing to stay, huh, Stone?

01:24:52.064 --> 01:24:54.389
Changed your mind, huh?

01:24:54.566 --> 01:24:57.235
Now that your car's
all busted to bubkes...

01:24:57.402 --> 01:25:01.185
...and you're feeling pretty good
about yourself in general, huh?

01:25:03.031 --> 01:25:04.360
Come here.

01:25:12.623 --> 01:25:14.995
I had them up once.

01:25:15.167 --> 01:25:19.116
Over 700 babies I delivered
in this town over the years.

01:25:19.295 --> 01:25:20.623
Nurse Packer.

01:25:20.796 --> 01:25:25.872
She popped right out complete with
teeth and hair and bit me. An omen.

01:25:26.051 --> 01:25:27.379
Nicholson.

01:25:27.552 --> 01:25:29.260
Hank.

01:25:30.262 --> 01:25:35.220
I gave them birth, saw them through
every sneeze and sniffle...

01:25:35.392 --> 01:25:38.725
...and sometimes even walked them
to the gravesite.

01:25:39.479 --> 01:25:43.428
They're pretty well
my portfolio, Stone.

01:25:43.607 --> 01:25:47.984
That and an old car, an old house.

01:25:48.361 --> 01:25:51.611
I wouldn't trade any of them for gold.

01:25:52.448 --> 01:25:54.654
Well, maybe gold.

01:25:55.325 --> 01:25:57.650
Or cash money.

01:26:01.205 --> 01:26:03.078
- Hey.
- Doc.

01:26:04.082 --> 01:26:05.956
Hey, Mary, how's our girl?

01:26:06.126 --> 01:26:09.957
We decided she's gonna be
"Benjamina," after you.

01:26:10.838 --> 01:26:12.711
What?

01:26:13.507 --> 01:26:15.333
Thank you.

01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:19.003
There's an obstetrician coming up
from Athens General later...

01:26:19.178 --> 01:26:21.634
...just to make sure everything's okay.

01:26:22.890 --> 01:26:24.549
Benjamina.

01:26:26.434 --> 01:26:30.894
Yo, doc, I wanted to just thank you
for, you know, everything...

01:26:31.063 --> 01:26:34.064
...so I made you this in appreciation.

01:26:34.775 --> 01:26:40.112
I know it ain't very much, so if there's
ever anything at all I can do for you...

01:26:40.279 --> 01:26:44.775
Just let me know what happens
with Ellen, Jimmy Joe and the Pakistani.

01:27:04.841 --> 01:27:07.047
I heard what happened last night.
You did great.

01:27:07.844 --> 01:27:12.137
- I didn't know what I was doing.
- Well, sometimes that's the best way.

01:27:13.599 --> 01:27:15.556
There's something
that I wanted to say.

01:27:15.726 --> 01:27:19.723
Something I wanted to say
to you first. Is that okay?

01:27:20.313 --> 01:27:24.773
So I've been doing a lot of thinking
about last night.

01:27:24.942 --> 01:27:27.859
Last night was really difficult.

01:27:28.153 --> 01:27:33.063
Everything's all turned around now.
I've been thinking about you and me...

01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:36.774
...and big cities, small towns...
- Well, I'm gonna marry Hank.

01:27:38.912 --> 01:27:40.987
I've decided.

01:27:45.083 --> 01:27:47.123
It's a plane ticket to Los Angeles.

01:27:47.752 --> 01:27:49.626
The whole town chipped in.

01:27:49.796 --> 01:27:54.753
We've kept you here this long, and if you
wait for Melvin to fix your car again...

01:27:56.885 --> 01:27:59.173
You got Los Angeles waiting for you.

01:27:59.345 --> 01:28:02.381
I've got Emma. It's not fair to you.

01:28:02.556 --> 01:28:05.510
Hank's steady, and he's here.

01:28:05.684 --> 01:28:07.392
You...

01:28:08.186 --> 01:28:12.265
You're like a big, bright shooting star and
you're right, Ben, you'd burn out here.

01:28:17.819 --> 01:28:19.479
Wait a minute.

01:28:25.075 --> 01:28:28.325
Well, Ben Stone, you have five minutes
to say goodbye to Shangri-la.

01:28:28.495 --> 01:28:32.029
Cotton will give you a police escort
to the airport.

01:28:39.462 --> 01:28:41.834
We made you a sack lunch.

01:28:42.006 --> 01:28:44.413
Airplane food can cause gas.

01:28:50.513 --> 01:28:52.754
I guess I'll watch after your pig.

01:28:52.932 --> 01:28:56.300
Just hope she takes to the farm
after living in town like this.

01:28:56.977 --> 01:28:58.934
Appreciate it.

01:28:59.395 --> 01:29:01.933
A lot of folks around here
gonna miss you.

01:29:02.773 --> 01:29:06.307
I don't mean me.
But a lot of folks.

01:29:38.261 --> 01:29:39.755
Adieu.

01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:51.271
Back to the interstate,
Ben Stone, huh?

01:29:51.439 --> 01:29:52.897
Back to the interstate.

01:31:24.558 --> 01:31:26.515
You okay?

01:31:27.394 --> 01:31:29.932
Oh, yes, I am fine.

01:31:34.859 --> 01:31:38.607
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.
Could you hold, please.

01:31:38.779 --> 01:31:42.858
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.
Good morning, Halberstrom Clinic.

01:31:44.241 --> 01:31:46.447
Oh, hold. Yes, doctor.

01:31:47.286 --> 01:31:49.492
- Mr. Stone?
- Dr. Stone.

01:31:51.706 --> 01:31:53.745
Dr. Halberstrom can see you now.

01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:11.755
Do you have any idea how many
applications I went through this year?

01:32:11.931 --> 01:32:14.766
Yes, sir. That's why I knew
this interview was important.

01:32:14.934 --> 01:32:17.768
I would've been here earlier
if I could've been. I think...

01:32:17.936 --> 01:32:22.514
I know you're a great surgeon, Stone.
That whole pile is full of great surgeons.

01:32:22.899 --> 01:32:24.808
Did you expect special consideration...

01:32:24.984 --> 01:32:26.976
...because we're from
the same hometown?

01:32:27.152 --> 01:32:29.310
- Because I knew your father?
- No, sir.

01:32:29.488 --> 01:32:32.156
Good. Because you didn't get shit.

01:32:32.323 --> 01:32:36.735
You wouldn't be here at all if it weren't
for a call I got from Dr. Aurelius Hogue.

01:32:39.079 --> 01:32:40.573
Dr. Hogue called you?

01:32:40.747 --> 01:32:43.783
I saw two doctors last week
with more experience than you...

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:46.662
...and better board certification scores.

01:32:47.920 --> 01:32:50.955
Dr. Hogue's a piece of work, isn't he?

01:32:51.297 --> 01:32:52.673
What did he say?

01:32:52.840 --> 01:32:56.624
That you were doing volunteer
family practice down South somewhere.

01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:02.634
Yes. Yeah. Yes, yes, that's right.

01:33:03.391 --> 01:33:07.055
Went there to get that small-town chip
off your shoulder, didn't you?

01:33:07.227 --> 01:33:11.355
- Yeah.
- Well, you're braver than I was, Stone.

01:33:11.523 --> 01:33:14.689
Any case,
Hogue said you were, quote:

01:33:14.859 --> 01:33:18.808
"One hellaciously fine physician."

01:33:18.987 --> 01:33:22.819
That I would be " a bovine,
clodpated, citified moron"...

01:33:22.991 --> 01:33:25.446
...if I didn't hire you on the spot.

01:33:25.618 --> 01:33:27.575
I wrote it down so I wouldn't forget.

01:33:27.745 --> 01:33:30.496
So I guess you're in, Stone. Congrats.

01:33:30.664 --> 01:33:32.656
What time do I tee off?

01:33:32.832 --> 01:33:35.074
You do play golf, don't you?

01:33:35.251 --> 01:33:38.584
Great. Don't worry about that.
It's not anywhere you can see it.

01:33:38.754 --> 01:33:42.667
The secret to this business is to get
a good pace going for yourself.

01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:46.672
Nobody likes to admit it,
but medicine's a volume business.

01:33:46.844 --> 01:33:49.548
Ninety-nine percent of what we do
is boilerplate surgery.

01:33:49.721 --> 01:33:52.556
It means we can afford
the one percent that's meaningful.

01:33:52.724 --> 01:33:56.472
Disfigurements, birth defects,
hare lips.

01:33:57.478 --> 01:34:00.763
Cleft palates.
You live for those moments.

01:34:00.939 --> 01:34:03.062
The bigger you get, the bigger the nut.

01:34:03.232 --> 01:34:07.064
We're a service industry. Comes with
the territory. Fixed costs, specialization.

01:34:07.236 --> 01:34:09.987
People adjust to it or fail.
Look at cable TV.

01:34:10.155 --> 01:34:12.361
You're gonna see
some changes, Stone.

01:34:13.032 --> 01:34:17.492
Stone, see if patient number 434
is in preop yet.

01:34:17.661 --> 01:34:21.030
We can squeeze one more in
before lunch, don't you think?

01:35:00.864 --> 01:35:04.030
<i>Hi. This is
the National Weather Service forecast...</i>

01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.572
<i>... for the greater Grady area tomorrow.</i>

01:35:06.744 --> 01:35:09.744
<i>There'll be plenty of sunshine
and blue skies.</i>

01:35:09.913 --> 01:35:12.664
<i>The old temperature
should be in the 90s again...</i>

01:35:12.832 --> 01:35:17.125
<i>... but a cool afternoon breeze will
make it all worthwhile come evening.</i>

01:35:17.294 --> 01:35:21.208
<i>Y'all look out for the lightning bugs
after sunset.</i>

01:35:40.939 --> 01:35:43.346
- Actress alert.
- Excuse me.

01:35:43.525 --> 01:35:45.433
Some girl called for you.

01:35:45.610 --> 01:35:50.235
Said you'd know who it was,
said she'd meet you at this bar.

01:35:51.114 --> 01:35:55.407
Like, as if you're gonna rush
right over there. Right.

01:35:55.576 --> 01:36:00.996
Totally unbelievable Southern accent.
An actress, I'll bet.

01:36:31.815 --> 01:36:35.598
- Hi. Can I help you?
- I'm supposed to meet someone, a girl.

01:36:36.277 --> 01:36:38.234
Ben.

01:36:45.618 --> 01:36:47.776
Nancy Lee?

01:36:52.290 --> 01:36:58.125
Well, I had to give it a shot, you know.
I just thought, just in case.

01:36:58.629 --> 01:37:00.289
Guess not.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:03.832
You...

01:37:04.592 --> 01:37:07.297
You drove all this way
just to bring me my car?

01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:08.798
Sort of.

01:37:08.971 --> 01:37:12.174
Well, I mean, it gave me an excuse
to get the hell out of Grady.

01:37:12.349 --> 01:37:14.886
Pardon my French.
Things were bad before...

01:37:15.059 --> 01:37:18.392
...but since you left,
they got positively stagnant.

01:37:21.815 --> 01:37:25.065
- How's Hogue?
- Well, he's the same.

01:37:27.737 --> 01:37:30.654
- Melvin?
- Same.

01:37:31.448 --> 01:37:32.776
How's your dad?

01:37:34.242 --> 01:37:36.780
Why don't you ask me about Vialula?

01:37:37.787 --> 01:37:41.949
What's there to ask, really?
I guess she and Hank are...

01:37:42.124 --> 01:37:43.783
You're in my chair.

01:37:45.710 --> 01:37:47.868
Slide a bit, Nancy Lee.

01:37:50.631 --> 01:37:55.422
There's a man in the toilet selling
aftershave. Now, what's that all about?

01:37:56.594 --> 01:37:58.088
Hank.

01:37:59.930 --> 01:38:01.721
What are you doing here?

01:38:01.890 --> 01:38:05.140
Took my own advice, doc.
Knowing when to stay, when to get out.

01:38:06.102 --> 01:38:08.972
I thought you and Lou
were gonna get...

01:38:09.146 --> 01:38:13.392
Lou was never gonna marry me.
So I broke it off, clean.

01:38:14.901 --> 01:38:16.977
You dumped her?

01:38:17.153 --> 01:38:19.359
A man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do...

01:38:19.530 --> 01:38:23.609
...even if it's in California.
Sense of higher purpose, you know?

01:38:25.743 --> 01:38:27.652
Is that a star?

01:38:27.828 --> 01:38:30.533
No, that's Ted Danson.

01:38:42.674 --> 01:38:45.247
I'm going for breakfast.
You want anything?

01:38:45.426 --> 01:38:47.751
How about Bob Barker?

01:38:47.929 --> 01:38:50.336
I'll see what I can do.

01:38:59.313 --> 01:39:01.352
Howdy.

01:39:05.818 --> 01:39:07.941
You steal that pig?

01:39:08.863 --> 01:39:12.112
I heard she was wasting away
in this one-pig town, so...

01:39:12.282 --> 01:39:14.571
And you thought you'd come back
and rescue her.

01:39:15.076 --> 01:39:17.745
Yeah. Something like that.

01:39:18.496 --> 01:39:20.903
What makes you think
she'll take you back?

01:39:23.041 --> 01:39:24.619
Because I love her.

01:39:28.421 --> 01:39:30.994
Go back to Los Angeles.

01:39:31.924 --> 01:39:34.628
I don't want Los Angeles.

01:39:34.926 --> 01:39:36.835
I want you.

01:39:46.561 --> 01:39:49.051
You got great tonsils.

01:39:52.566 --> 01:39:54.439
That ain't all.

01:39:56.152 --> 01:39:59.355
I just thought of something.
I can collect that $ 10 from Nicholson.

01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:01.403
- You lost that bet.
- I did not.

01:40:01.573 --> 01:40:03.067
- Who says?
- Me.

01:40:03.241 --> 01:40:08.116
- You have no say. You are the bet.
- The bet was for one week. You lost.

01:40:08.287 --> 01:40:09.781
It's your word against mine.

01:40:09.955 --> 01:40:13.324
You would sully my reputation
for 10 measly dollars?

01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:17.283
Absolutely. I don't even know
what "sully" means.
