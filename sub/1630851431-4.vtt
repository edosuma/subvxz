WEBVTT

00:24.666 --> 00:26.125
-Hello.
-It's cold, isn't it?

00:26.750 --> 00:27.833
It's freezing.

00:27.916 --> 00:29.291
I thought Ulsan was warmer.

00:29.375 --> 00:31.500
-It's suddenly so cold.
-Did you wait long?

00:31.583 --> 00:33.375
No. Maybe 10, 15 minutes?

00:33.458 --> 00:34.333
How are you?

00:34.416 --> 00:35.250
PAIK JONG-WON

00:35.333 --> 00:36.333
Same old.

00:36.416 --> 00:39.916
For once,
we aren't meeting for work favors.

00:40.000 --> 00:40.833
NAH YUNG-SUK

00:40.916 --> 00:41.916
I know.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.583
Whenever I come to you,

00:43.666 --> 00:45.333
-it's to ask you for a favor.
-Right.

00:45.416 --> 00:46.250
NETWORK FRIEND

00:46.333 --> 00:47.583
If you call, I know why.

00:47.666 --> 00:49.375
-Today…
-Today is to play.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.375
-No favor to ask.
-Not exactly playing.

00:51.458 --> 00:52.875
I'm here to play, a bit.

00:54.750 --> 00:57.250
-You said you'd treat me out today.
-I did.

00:57.875 --> 00:58.791
Just follow me.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.083
You haven't eaten yet, right?

01:01.166 --> 01:02.791
Come on. It's you.

01:02.875 --> 01:05.333
I wouldn't visit you on a full stomach.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.416
-Of course I haven't eaten.
-I see.

01:10.291 --> 01:14.208
Given today's purpose,
we won't be driving once we get there.

01:14.791 --> 01:16.958
-We're drinking, right?
-Right.

01:17.041 --> 01:18.375
So we'll leave the car.

01:18.458 --> 01:19.291
Yes.

01:19.875 --> 01:21.333
I hear you like makgeolli.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.291
I like jeon more than makgeolli.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.458
I see. Jeon more than makgeolli.

01:28.541 --> 01:30.833
We always pair jeon with makgeolli.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.583
I got into makgeolli recently.
I make it at home.

01:34.666 --> 01:35.500
It's fun.

01:35.583 --> 01:39.000
I've got maybe ten makgeolli jars at home.

01:39.791 --> 01:41.041
Yeah.

01:41.125 --> 01:42.125
-At home?
-Yeah.

01:42.916 --> 01:45.208
It's hilarious
that you have those jars at home.

01:45.291 --> 01:46.125
Right?

01:46.208 --> 01:48.500
So you haven't been
to a makgeolli brewery?

01:49.000 --> 01:50.583
-Once, a long time ago.
-Where?

01:50.666 --> 01:52.875
-Yecheon, Gyeongbuk Province.
-Yecheon.

01:52.958 --> 01:54.791
Some ten years ago, for 2 Days & 1 Night.

01:54.875 --> 01:57.083
-Right.
-For the shoot.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.916
I can't forget that makgeolli.

01:59.541 --> 02:01.708
It was so… I thought it was yogurt.

02:01.791 --> 02:04.291
It must have been a famous place.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.041
Today's destination is famous too.

02:08.125 --> 02:09.416
I'm excited.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.583
-It's like a pilgrimage.
-Yeah.

02:13.125 --> 02:15.958
Visiting makgeolli places
has become popular lately.

02:16.041 --> 02:17.750
Makgeolli breweries.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.333
-Is that the trend?
-Yeah.

02:19.416 --> 02:21.375
They call it "visiting brewery."

02:21.458 --> 02:22.958
You go and tour the site.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.500
You see the process, drink some.

02:26.291 --> 02:27.666
-That's great.
-Yeah.

02:28.208 --> 02:31.500
I can't believe I'm going on
a makgeolli trip with you.

02:33.291 --> 02:34.333
What a fortune.

03:22.375 --> 03:23.458
This must be it.

03:23.541 --> 03:25.125
-"Boksoon Doga"?
-Yes.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.458
Now, this would be worth visiting.

03:28.541 --> 03:30.333
-It's nice, isn't it?
-Yes.

03:41.166 --> 03:42.875
TRY OUR PURE HANDMADE MAKGEOLLI

03:55.041 --> 03:56.750
It looks very cool.

03:59.333 --> 04:00.291
Do you smell that?

04:01.875 --> 04:03.833
It's a cool building.

04:03.916 --> 04:06.416
Younger people would like it.

04:06.500 --> 04:08.833
-The exterior says it all.
-It's something.

04:09.625 --> 04:10.500
Look.

04:11.166 --> 04:13.333
-"Visiting brewery."
-Right.

04:13.416 --> 04:16.666
There are more than
40 of these nationwide.

04:22.583 --> 04:24.791
-Look, the entrance.
-There are jars.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.583
-These are makgeolli jars.
-Yes.

04:28.083 --> 04:29.666
Much bigger than my jars.

04:31.041 --> 04:33.583
Mine are 10-liter ones. These are huge.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.666
NO. 1

04:35.750 --> 04:37.291
NO. 6

04:39.166 --> 04:40.208
Hello.

04:40.291 --> 04:42.333
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

04:42.416 --> 04:44.333
-Can we look at these?
-Sure.

04:44.416 --> 04:45.250
Makgeolli jars?

04:45.333 --> 04:46.875
Yes, our makgeolli jars.

04:46.958 --> 04:48.791
-The mouth is wide.
-It is.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.916
It must be these.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.250
I used to see these at my grandmother's.

04:53.333 --> 04:55.041
My grandparents ran a brewery.

04:55.125 --> 04:56.625
-Really?
-Yes.

04:56.708 --> 04:58.458
I've never seen such big jars.

04:58.541 --> 05:00.833
We had tens of these at the brewery.

05:05.166 --> 05:07.666
The rice here turns into alcohol.

05:07.750 --> 05:08.583
Correct.

05:08.666 --> 05:12.250
We use local rice from Ulju, Ulsan.

05:14.125 --> 05:17.208
-Must be a sight at fall.
-It's fantastic.

05:17.291 --> 05:22.208
You can really see the golden waves
of the harvesting season.

05:23.583 --> 05:26.791
If makgeolli was wine,
this would be the vineyard.

05:26.875 --> 05:30.791
It's about making local drinks
using local ingredients.

05:41.625 --> 05:43.500
Let me show you the inside.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.250
We make all the drinks here.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.208
-How about it?
-Is that how it works?

05:47.291 --> 05:49.166
-"Visiting brewery"?
-Yes.

05:49.250 --> 05:52.958
When you come, we tell you
about the makgeolli making process.

05:53.041 --> 05:55.291
-I smell alcohol. It's great.
-It's wonderful.

05:55.375 --> 05:58.500
I used to get the urge to drink
when I smelled meat before.

05:58.583 --> 06:01.458
Smelling this makes me want to drink.
Must be too much drinking.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.416
-After you.
-Wow, the rice.

06:09.333 --> 06:10.166
Man.

06:11.875 --> 06:12.833
-Godubab?
-Yes.

06:12.916 --> 06:15.125
We're making godubab here.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.000
What's a godubab?

06:22.083 --> 06:23.333
Right, godubab.

06:23.416 --> 06:25.166
-So we have rice.
-Yes.

06:25.250 --> 06:28.375
-What's rice cooked with too much water?
-Jinbab, watery rice.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.333
And the opposite, with less water?

06:30.416 --> 06:31.916
-Hard-cooked rice?
-Yes.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.416
-That's godubab.
-You let the rice cool

06:34.500 --> 06:36.291
and harden it to make godubab.

06:36.375 --> 06:37.208
This is steamed?

06:37.291 --> 06:39.625
-Yes, we did the steaming.
-Steamed.

06:39.708 --> 06:41.291
Wanna try some?

06:41.375 --> 06:43.000
-Can we?
-Sure!

06:45.333 --> 06:47.208
This is literally dry and firm.

06:47.291 --> 06:50.166
Just a bit, otherwise we can't drink.

06:50.250 --> 06:51.166
Thank you.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.875
-It looks like uncooked rice.
-Try it.

07:06.291 --> 07:08.458
-It's very lightly….
-Yeah.

07:08.958 --> 07:12.041
-It's like lightly steamed rice.
-It's gotta be steamed.

07:12.958 --> 07:16.416
You take godubab and mix with nuruk,
the leavening agent, and water

07:16.500 --> 07:17.750
to make makgeolli.

07:19.333 --> 07:23.916
GODUBAB AND NURUK

07:29.791 --> 07:32.333
WATER

07:36.416 --> 07:39.791
MIX

08:21.750 --> 08:25.708
FERMENT

08:48.583 --> 08:51.500
FILTER

08:58.583 --> 09:01.541
ADD WATER

09:12.250 --> 09:16.166
MAKGEOLLI

09:16.250 --> 09:17.958
We ferment in the fermenting room.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.083
This way.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.958
You can feel the warmth
when you touch here.

09:24.041 --> 09:26.166
The heat produced from the fermentation?

09:26.250 --> 09:27.416
-Yes.
-Wow.

09:27.916 --> 09:28.750
The alcohol…

09:28.833 --> 09:30.416
-Very cool.
-Can you hear it?

09:30.500 --> 09:32.250
-The sound.
-Can you hear it?

09:32.916 --> 09:35.666
-This is amazing.
-Isn't it like opening a soda?

09:36.208 --> 09:37.416
That's fermentation.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.000
Would you look here?

09:39.083 --> 09:40.750
-Can we open it?
-Yup.

09:42.041 --> 09:44.416
The alcohol is boiling.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.291
-This is a whole new level.
-Wow.

09:47.625 --> 09:48.500
Look at this.

09:48.583 --> 09:49.916
-This here.
-Wow.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.083
It's very active now.

09:52.166 --> 09:53.875
-The alcohol is aging.
-Actively.

09:53.958 --> 09:56.625
The sheer volume must be
what creates the loud sound.

09:57.375 --> 09:59.541
I should try it with a jar like this.

10:00.041 --> 10:04.125
My mother can tell from just the sound
that the alcohol is aging well.

10:04.791 --> 10:07.000
-She knows from the sound.
-She's the master.

10:07.083 --> 10:09.291
Our brand name comes from her name.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.833
-That's her name.
-Boksoon?

10:10.916 --> 10:11.791
-Yes.

10:11.875 --> 10:13.666
That's your mother's name.

10:13.750 --> 10:14.625
I am…

10:14.708 --> 10:15.750
-The son?
-Yes.

10:15.833 --> 10:17.541
-Second generation.
-Yes.

10:17.625 --> 10:20.583
Our family business started with gayangju.

10:20.666 --> 10:22.708
We learned to make the alcohol

10:22.791 --> 10:25.541
from our grandmother and continued it on.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.250
-What is gayangju?
-Home-made alcohol.

10:28.750 --> 10:30.375
Not the ones made for sale.

10:30.875 --> 10:32.875
-Right.
-Made for drinking at home.

10:32.958 --> 10:37.250
So you added nuruk and water
into the godubab

10:37.333 --> 10:40.250
and put it in a jar to get to this stage?

10:40.833 --> 10:45.583
You keep fermenting
until the fermentation completes

10:45.666 --> 10:47.666
and the product stabilizes.

10:47.750 --> 10:50.500
-The one next to it.
-Is that finished?

10:50.583 --> 10:52.875
It has completed the first fermentation.

10:52.958 --> 10:53.791
As you can see,

10:54.500 --> 10:57.125
-this one's quiet.
-It is quiet.

10:57.208 --> 11:00.458
After the first fermentation is over,
you get this.

11:02.583 --> 11:03.500
Unbelievable.

11:03.583 --> 11:04.541
This is amazing.

11:04.625 --> 11:06.708
We call this wonju. Wanna try some?

11:08.875 --> 11:10.250
-Can we?
-Yup.

11:11.000 --> 11:14.083
What else do you do
to turn this into makgeolli?

11:14.166 --> 11:19.500
Typically,
people would make gayangju at home.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.791
For a typical makgeolli on the market,

11:21.875 --> 11:23.958
you'd filter and mix with water.

11:24.041 --> 11:27.583
So this is before the separation and all.

11:27.666 --> 11:29.041
-Not yet squeezed out.
-Yes.

11:29.125 --> 11:30.500
This is wonju.

11:40.125 --> 11:41.875
I love this.

11:42.416 --> 11:44.875
-Not sweet, right?
-This is already great.

11:44.958 --> 11:45.791
Usually…

11:45.875 --> 11:47.875
-I like that it's not sweet.
-Yeah?

11:49.166 --> 11:51.166
This would be about 14, 15%?

11:51.250 --> 11:52.583
-Yes.
-Sounds about right.

11:52.666 --> 11:54.500
-Around that.
-That's why.

11:54.583 --> 11:55.833
It feels like wine.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.875
Like I'm drinking wine.

11:59.833 --> 12:01.208
Shall we sit here then?

12:01.708 --> 12:02.875
Bring out a table?

12:02.958 --> 12:04.416
Make us some jeon!

12:07.666 --> 12:09.166
Does the nuruk come from here?

12:09.250 --> 12:11.250
-We make our own.
-Now, that's technique.

12:11.750 --> 12:13.458
Our secret is in the nuruk.

12:13.541 --> 12:19.333
Our nuruk is made by the grandmothers,
the residents of this town and my mother.

12:19.416 --> 12:21.083
-It's a lot of work.
-Yes.

12:21.166 --> 12:24.458
The temperature and humidity
need to be just right.

12:25.291 --> 12:26.958
What does nuruk look like?

12:34.833 --> 12:36.291
WHOLE WHEAT

12:38.833 --> 12:40.625
GRIND

12:44.000 --> 12:46.083
KNEAD

13:28.958 --> 13:31.750
NURUK MOLD

13:35.833 --> 13:39.166
NURUK

13:39.250 --> 13:41.375
They feed on the rice

13:41.458 --> 13:43.375
and spit it out
to make the fermentation process.

13:43.458 --> 13:44.333
RICE

13:44.416 --> 13:46.916
At first, you need to break down the rice.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.125
Then it turns into sugar
and becomes sweet.

13:49.208 --> 13:52.083
Back when we were in elementary school,

13:52.750 --> 13:55.208
we were told
to chew on the rice when we eat.

13:55.291 --> 13:56.958
Chewing brings out the sweetness.

13:57.041 --> 13:59.291
That's the process
of rice turning into sugar.

13:59.375 --> 14:03.375
Then the mold spits out
alcohol and carbon dioxide.

14:03.458 --> 14:04.541
CARBON DIOXIDE
ALCOHOL

14:04.625 --> 14:09.916
This brewery is famous
because they make excellent alcohol

14:10.000 --> 14:12.833
that really holds onto the carbonation

14:12.916 --> 14:16.875
so that the final product
is heavily carbonated, like champagne.

14:16.958 --> 14:18.333
-Yes.
-The carbonation.

14:18.416 --> 14:21.416
After the first fermentation is complete,

14:21.500 --> 14:22.750
we bottle it.

14:22.833 --> 14:26.666
After bottling, the second fermentation
takes place in our garden.

14:26.750 --> 14:31.458
We keep the carbonation
to make sparkling makgeolli.

14:32.625 --> 14:35.166
We can't keep drinking here,

14:35.250 --> 14:38.250
-so let's move on.
-Yes, over there.

14:38.333 --> 14:41.750
-You can taste our alcohol there.
-A tasting room?

14:41.833 --> 14:43.750
Yes, you can taste it.

14:43.833 --> 14:45.458
Please enjoy.

14:45.541 --> 14:47.583
-Thank you.
-We'll be sure to enjoy it.

14:47.666 --> 14:48.583
Yes, thank you.

14:51.666 --> 14:53.458
-There are customers already.
-Yeah.

14:54.041 --> 14:56.166
Hi. Enjoy your meal!

14:56.250 --> 14:57.083
Yup.

15:02.458 --> 15:03.333
Hello.

15:03.416 --> 15:05.916
-Hello.
-How was the experience?

15:06.000 --> 15:07.125
We aren't done yet.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.250
This is where it really begins.

15:09.333 --> 15:11.875
-Try some.
-Just a little.

15:11.958 --> 15:13.375
Careful when you open it.

15:13.458 --> 15:16.416
-Do tell us.
-Shake, tilt it 45 degrees.

15:16.500 --> 15:18.125
Open and close a few times.

15:18.208 --> 15:19.833
It's gassy.

15:19.916 --> 15:21.625
100% natural carbonation.

15:23.166 --> 15:24.375
Open and close.

15:24.458 --> 15:26.333
We've all done it. Shake and open…

15:26.416 --> 15:27.916
-And it explodes.
-Yeah.

15:28.750 --> 15:30.375
This has a lot more carbonation.

15:30.458 --> 15:32.458
-It's boiling.
-Natural carbonation.

15:34.666 --> 15:37.125
Can we sample some
since this is the tasting room?

15:37.208 --> 15:39.125
-I'll pour you a glass.
-Yes.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.708
-The carbonation is unreal.
-Wow, the carbonation.

15:56.000 --> 15:59.416
-It's a bit sweeter than the one earlier.
-This is straight up cider.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.083
You know.

16:02.833 --> 16:05.416
We could get drunk on this in a heartbeat.

16:06.125 --> 16:08.083
This is a dangerous place.

16:10.166 --> 16:12.583
Sir, we'll take a bottle.

16:12.666 --> 16:14.166
-One hand-made makgeolli.
-Sure.

16:14.250 --> 16:16.708
I told you I didn't like it sweet earlier.

16:16.791 --> 16:18.208
-But this is delicious.
-Yes.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.000
-A change of heart.
-Completely.

16:21.791 --> 16:23.541
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

16:24.250 --> 16:26.208
It's a take-out system.

16:29.166 --> 16:30.125
-Sit.
-Yup.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.500
Wow.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.333
Make sure it doesn't explode.

16:37.416 --> 16:39.083
Hey, I got this.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.000
Tilt it 45 degrees.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.541
We're in for some trouble.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.125
Uh-oh.

16:49.458 --> 16:50.375
So interesting.

16:50.458 --> 16:53.125
We had a champagne-like drink after all.

16:53.208 --> 16:55.791
I've never had one
with such strong carbonation.

16:58.000 --> 16:59.791
-Thank you.
-Drink up.

17:03.041 --> 17:05.166
I wish it was sunset.

17:05.250 --> 17:07.375
-Let me pour for you.
-It's not quite setting.

17:07.458 --> 17:09.458
Or is it? Since it's the afternoon.

17:09.958 --> 17:11.125
In ten minutes,

17:11.208 --> 17:15.458
you won't know the difference
between a rising or a setting sun.

17:15.541 --> 17:16.541
This is nice.

17:17.833 --> 17:18.666
Cheers.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.541
I had a foresight.

17:26.041 --> 17:27.166
You see, yesterday.

17:30.625 --> 17:31.458
Because…

17:32.875 --> 17:34.708
This is my personal preference.

17:35.916 --> 17:37.333
I brought some munchies.

17:40.708 --> 17:42.958
You told me earlier.

17:44.125 --> 17:46.041
You were excited to travel with me.

17:46.125 --> 17:47.375
I've troubled you.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.750
I wanted to show you how I drink.

17:53.250 --> 17:55.375
My favorite snack with makgeolli.

17:55.458 --> 17:57.166
-You mentioned jeon earlier.
-Yes.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.333
My favorite is kimchi.

17:59.416 --> 18:00.625
Fermented yeolmu kimchi.

18:00.708 --> 18:02.833
-Young summer radish.
-Smells good.

18:02.916 --> 18:06.625
I'm not joking.
I was trying to time it for today.

18:06.708 --> 18:08.875
I made this a week ago
but it won't ferment.

18:09.541 --> 18:11.250
So I put it in my kids' room,

18:11.333 --> 18:14.708
put a blanket over it,
and my wife got so mad.

18:14.791 --> 18:16.458
That their clothes would stink.

18:17.166 --> 18:20.666
But when she tasted it,
she complimented me.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.791
Makgeolli and fermented yeolmu kimchi.

18:23.875 --> 18:25.625
Makgeolli and yeolmu kimchi.

18:26.500 --> 18:28.583
This is my favorite drinking snack.

18:29.416 --> 18:30.458
I'm excited.

18:31.208 --> 18:32.333
-Mr. Paik.
-Yes?

18:32.416 --> 18:34.666
Which comes first? Drinking or snack?

18:35.250 --> 18:36.583
I drink and then eat.

18:36.666 --> 18:37.916
Cheers.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.916
Fermented kimchi for fermented alcohol.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.250
Similar flavor profiles. Sourness.

18:48.333 --> 18:49.166
You're right.

19:00.666 --> 19:01.833
Nice, isn't it?

19:01.916 --> 19:05.083
Fermented food and drink.
It tells us something about our ancestors.

19:05.166 --> 19:06.833
-This is fermented too.
-Yup.

19:07.541 --> 19:09.750
That's why the flavors work together.

19:14.833 --> 19:15.916
Oh man.

19:16.791 --> 19:17.750
This is bad.

19:17.833 --> 19:19.541
It's so good it's dangerous.

19:24.833 --> 19:25.833
It's good, right?

19:30.916 --> 19:34.000
Next, my second favorite snack
for makgeolli.

19:34.083 --> 19:35.708
Namul.

19:35.791 --> 19:36.916
Not just any namul.

19:37.416 --> 19:39.291
-Dried namul soaked and cooked.
-This…

19:39.375 --> 19:42.000
-We eat this at the first full moon.
-Yes, guess.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.250
What's this? Zucchini?

19:44.333 --> 19:45.500
Yes, zucchini.

19:49.791 --> 19:51.416
I see this often. Eggplant?

19:52.083 --> 19:53.000
Two down.

19:53.500 --> 19:56.541
I don't know the rest.
Green ones all look the same.

19:57.041 --> 19:57.875
Saussurea.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.333
Amur wallflower.

20:00.416 --> 20:01.333
Amur wallflower.

20:01.833 --> 20:02.750
Rapeseed namul.

20:05.375 --> 20:06.708
Namul pairs very well.

20:07.458 --> 20:08.416
And it's tasty.

20:11.458 --> 20:14.083
Last night, I soaked the dried namul

20:14.708 --> 20:16.083
and stir-fried them myself.

20:16.791 --> 20:17.625
This…

20:18.625 --> 20:20.708
-It's worth your trip, right?
-Absolutely.

20:21.666 --> 20:22.541
Thank you.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.125
This is delicious.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.291
I thought this would be better than jeon.

20:27.791 --> 20:28.750
Wow.

20:30.041 --> 20:32.500
-I wouldn't have thought of these.
-It works, right?

20:32.583 --> 20:35.000
-So this…
-Let me tell you why.

20:35.791 --> 20:39.625
We are led to believe it best pairs
with whatever we see in restaurants.

20:39.708 --> 20:41.416
We choose from the selected menu.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.500
I bet you won't find a place

20:45.291 --> 20:47.125
-that serves namul…
-No namul.

20:47.208 --> 20:48.833
-…or fermented yeolmu kimchi.
-Never.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.541
This is never on the menu.

20:50.625 --> 20:55.000
I thought about the reason
why this combination works.

20:55.083 --> 20:57.958
When we make makgeolli, we use godubab.

20:58.041 --> 20:59.041
-Yes.
-Rice.

20:59.125 --> 21:00.708
It's made with rice.

21:00.791 --> 21:02.333
-Banchan with rice!
-That's it.

21:03.208 --> 21:04.250
You're right.

21:04.333 --> 21:05.458
Got goosebumps?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.000
You're right.

21:30.958 --> 21:33.208
That's the funny part.
When we drink makgeolli,

21:34.875 --> 21:36.291
we don't crave rice.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.958
-This is rice.
-Yes, this is rice.

21:40.125 --> 21:41.166
This is great.

21:41.958 --> 21:43.916
Tour of a local brewery.

21:44.416 --> 21:46.875
Get a drink
and bring back a bottle that you like.

21:47.750 --> 21:49.583
The good news is

21:50.541 --> 21:52.666
that visiting breweries
is becoming popular.

21:53.166 --> 21:54.916
This is second or third generation.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.166
-Second.
-Right, second.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.250
If you go elsewhere,

21:58.541 --> 22:00.416
they are often third generation.

22:02.125 --> 22:05.083
Are you giving your business to your kids?

22:05.166 --> 22:07.416
No, I don't care about that.

22:09.541 --> 22:11.541
But my second child does say this.

22:11.625 --> 22:14.500
Well, he's only six, so who knows?

22:14.583 --> 22:17.416
He knows his dad cooks
so he wants to cook too.

22:17.500 --> 22:18.333
Who knows?

22:19.166 --> 22:20.208
But…

22:20.291 --> 22:21.958
-Did you say six?
-Yes.

22:22.041 --> 22:25.750
-He'll change his mind about 17 times.
-I think so too.

22:30.375 --> 22:31.583
Not getting my hopes up.

22:32.833 --> 22:34.458
I don't think I'll hand it down.

22:34.541 --> 22:36.791
But if they want to inherit it,

22:36.875 --> 22:38.500
-then it's their will.
-Right.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.166
It's not about inheriting, per se.

22:41.250 --> 22:44.333
They might just want to walk
the same path as their father.

22:44.416 --> 22:46.125
They grew up watching you.

22:46.750 --> 22:47.958
How about you?

22:48.458 --> 22:50.666
Do you have a kid
who wants to be a producer?

22:50.750 --> 22:51.875
I have one child

22:51.958 --> 22:53.500
who's still in 7th grade.

22:53.583 --> 22:55.458
-Still a long way.
-Still clueless.

22:56.166 --> 22:57.583
But I do think about it.

22:57.666 --> 23:00.083
If my kid brings it up…

23:00.750 --> 23:02.833
-Would you oppose it?
-…would I support or not?

23:02.916 --> 23:04.750
I think about it. Not sure why I do.

23:04.833 --> 23:06.375
-But I do.
-What would you say?

23:07.333 --> 23:08.333
Everyday,

23:09.875 --> 23:11.000
I change my mind.

23:11.083 --> 23:14.666
In a way,
I'm one of the best producers out there.

23:14.750 --> 23:16.208
Right.

23:16.291 --> 23:19.833
But not everyone can be as lucky.

23:19.916 --> 23:21.208
Luck? You mean talent.

23:21.291 --> 23:24.958
And I know the difficulties
that come along with it.

23:25.041 --> 23:26.791
You're in the food business.

23:26.875 --> 23:29.666
While others only see the fancy side,

23:30.416 --> 23:34.041
you know all too well
that there are difficulties, too.

23:34.125 --> 23:35.833
So I get ahead of myself.

23:36.500 --> 23:38.666
The kid's still young.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.541
-I think that too.
-I'm the same.

23:41.625 --> 23:42.750
But…

23:44.041 --> 23:46.250
when people ask me for advice,

23:46.791 --> 23:49.250
I say, "Do what you like,
not what you're good at."

23:49.333 --> 23:50.291
It's confusing.

23:50.375 --> 23:53.000
If given the two choices,
I would always say,

23:53.083 --> 23:54.500
"Pick the one you like."

23:55.000 --> 23:58.416
If it's something you like,
you can enjoy the downfalls too.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.166
Even if you don't always succeed.

24:01.333 --> 24:03.416
And the chances of suceeding are higher.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.791
Because you put time into it.

24:04.875 --> 24:05.791
If I like what I do,

24:05.875 --> 24:07.541
-the chances are higher.
-Yes.

24:08.958 --> 24:10.166
-That's true.
-It is.

24:10.250 --> 24:11.666
-You have to like it.
-Yeah.

24:12.166 --> 24:14.416
This line of work is all the same.

24:21.250 --> 24:23.291
We are drinking makgeolli, with kimchi

24:23.375 --> 24:24.875
as the sun starts to set.

24:26.166 --> 24:28.000
We are over.

24:28.083 --> 24:29.541
This vibe calls for drinking.

24:30.041 --> 24:31.041
It's perfect.

24:33.583 --> 24:35.500
It's a sign from above. To drink more.

24:37.541 --> 24:39.083
Let's go get some jeon.

24:40.208 --> 24:41.791
Do you know of a good place?

24:42.541 --> 24:43.625
That's my specialty.

25:44.625 --> 25:45.666
SECOND ROUND

25:45.750 --> 25:46.958
Here's your yukjeon.

25:47.041 --> 25:47.875
Thank you.

25:47.958 --> 25:49.000
SECOND ROUND, JEON

25:49.083 --> 25:50.291
This is good, too.

25:51.625 --> 25:53.583
-We'll look at the drink menu.
-Sure.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.833
So many makgeolli choices.

25:58.416 --> 26:00.958
Three pages devoted to makgeolli.

26:02.375 --> 26:04.166
This one's famous, "Belly Button."

26:04.666 --> 26:06.541
-What a strange name.
-This is famous too.

26:06.625 --> 26:08.708
Let's try it. I've never had it.

26:10.208 --> 26:11.166
-Sir!
-Yes.

26:11.250 --> 26:12.833
Do you have "Tiger Belly Button"?

26:12.916 --> 26:14.375
-We do.
-We'll take one.

26:14.875 --> 26:16.041
-Here's the menu.
-Yes.

26:17.416 --> 26:18.708
-Thank you.
-Yup.

26:18.791 --> 26:20.250
TIGER BELLY BUTTON

26:25.625 --> 26:28.708
The naming plays a big part.
Does a tiger have a belly button?

26:29.625 --> 26:31.125
It really matters.

26:31.208 --> 26:34.500
This name certainly grabs your attention.

26:34.583 --> 26:35.416
I know.

26:36.541 --> 26:37.625
Thank you.

26:48.166 --> 26:51.000
This is the typical flavor we know.

26:51.083 --> 26:52.416
It really is.

26:53.583 --> 26:55.291
This one was 6.5%.

26:56.916 --> 27:00.166
We can kick it up a notch
and order a stronger one next.

27:03.083 --> 27:04.208
This…

27:05.458 --> 27:06.875
goes down so smoothly.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.583
My favorite, jeon.

27:10.333 --> 27:12.416
I've always liked jeon.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.250
I like it too.

27:28.833 --> 27:29.958
It's good.

27:37.791 --> 27:40.125
Why do we crave jeon with makgeolli?

27:40.666 --> 27:42.958
We crave jeon when we drink makgeolli.

27:43.875 --> 27:44.708
And also…

27:46.458 --> 27:47.708
-On rainy days.
-True.

27:49.375 --> 27:50.291
Somebody said

27:51.041 --> 27:52.000
that when it rains,

27:52.666 --> 27:55.333
the sound of the raindrops on the window

27:55.416 --> 27:56.875
-sounds like jeon.
-Like jeon.

27:56.958 --> 27:58.625
-When you fry it.
-It's a theory.

27:58.708 --> 28:01.166
That's why you crave it more.

28:37.583 --> 28:41.291
Makgeolli sales do skyrocket
on rainy days.

28:42.416 --> 28:45.500
-You run a store, so you'd know.
-I run a makgeolli franchise.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.041
Sales are higher on rainy days.

28:49.250 --> 28:51.375
Most restaurants are the opposite.

28:51.458 --> 28:52.708
-Really?
-Yes.

28:52.791 --> 28:55.166
Rainy day means lower sales.

28:58.500 --> 28:59.333
Also,

28:59.416 --> 29:02.583
makgeolli was originally drunk by farmers.

29:02.666 --> 29:04.708
When it rains, farmers can't go out.

29:04.791 --> 29:06.958
-They can't work.
-So they'd gather.

29:07.041 --> 29:09.625
And made jeon with flour
and ate it together.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.875
It's a theory.

29:10.958 --> 29:12.250
THEORY

29:12.333 --> 29:15.166
That sounds about right.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.625
Apparently, people pair it
with pizza these days.

29:18.708 --> 29:19.708
Makgeolli?

29:20.375 --> 29:21.291
I hear it works.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.166
Maybe because pizza is also a bit greasy.

29:24.250 --> 29:25.500
Possibly.

29:26.125 --> 29:27.833
What's the difference anyway?

29:27.916 --> 29:29.541
Pizza and jeon are similar.

29:30.208 --> 29:31.208
That makes sense.

29:41.250 --> 29:43.166
Should we get a dotori-muk?

29:43.250 --> 29:44.583
Acorn jelly? Cheers.

29:44.666 --> 29:45.500
Sir!

29:48.500 --> 29:49.791
Dotori-muk is a must.

29:49.875 --> 29:51.291
A must for makgeolli.

29:51.375 --> 29:52.750
Makgeolli after a hike.

29:52.833 --> 29:53.875
That's the best.

29:53.958 --> 29:56.083
-After you hike down.
-Really, the best.

29:57.666 --> 29:59.625
DOTORI-MUK

30:28.791 --> 30:31.166
It's not pre-mixed with sauce.

30:31.250 --> 30:32.083
Nice.

30:32.166 --> 30:33.416
Enjoy.

30:44.708 --> 30:45.916
Like the old times.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.833
-Old traditional flavor.
-Yes.

30:51.208 --> 30:52.541
It's a familiar taste.

30:55.125 --> 30:55.958
Good, right?

30:56.958 --> 30:59.750
How did you eat your dotori-muk?
Mixed in sauce?

31:00.541 --> 31:03.208
Soy sauce with a ton of sesame seeds?

31:03.291 --> 31:05.208
-Korean soup soy sauce.
-Both, I think.

31:05.958 --> 31:07.208
I'm from the countryside.

31:07.291 --> 31:10.250
So we'd put sesame oil
in Korean soup soy sauce.

31:10.333 --> 31:13.541
Crush some sesame seed into the soy sauce
and eat it.

31:13.625 --> 31:15.125
That sounds delicious.

31:26.541 --> 31:28.583
Should we try another makgeolli?

31:29.083 --> 31:30.250
This is the advantage

31:30.791 --> 31:32.500
of a makgeolli restaurant.

31:33.958 --> 31:35.791
We are kicking it up a notch, right?

31:37.500 --> 31:38.416
This.

31:38.500 --> 31:40.250
-12%?
-I heard it's good.

31:41.583 --> 31:42.416
Sir!

31:42.916 --> 31:43.750
Yes.

31:43.833 --> 31:45.750
We gotta try Haechang makgeolli.

31:45.833 --> 31:47.208
-12%.
-Yes, 12.

31:48.166 --> 31:49.000
Wait.

31:50.208 --> 31:52.166
Should we compare? There's one with 9%.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.416
-One of the 9% too?
-We'll do 9 and then 12.

31:54.500 --> 31:55.333
Got it.

31:55.958 --> 31:57.250
Actually the 12%.

31:57.333 --> 31:58.375
-12% too?
-Yup.

31:58.875 --> 31:59.708
Wait, 9%.

31:59.791 --> 32:01.291
-You want the 9%?
-Sorry.

32:01.791 --> 32:03.583
What are you thinking?

32:03.666 --> 32:05.500
I want to try it all.

32:06.375 --> 32:07.791
So my mind's all conflicted.

32:08.875 --> 32:10.958
I can't hide my instincts.

32:11.041 --> 32:12.708
I want to try this and that.

32:14.458 --> 32:15.291
Get both.

32:15.916 --> 32:18.083
I think you're born with it.

32:18.166 --> 32:19.750
In my opinion,

32:19.833 --> 32:21.500
you're born with it.

32:23.500 --> 32:24.916
Excuse me.

32:29.666 --> 32:31.833
HAECHANG

32:34.791 --> 32:36.166
Look at how thick this is.

32:40.083 --> 32:40.916
Haechang.

32:45.666 --> 32:47.333
Are you feeling it? Is this it?

32:52.875 --> 32:55.666
It's already sticky when you pour.

33:08.458 --> 33:11.041
-Good?
-It tastes better as the ABV goes up.

33:11.708 --> 33:12.958
Now we're talking.

33:13.041 --> 33:14.916
How should I put it? The weight?

33:15.000 --> 33:18.125
-This has a richer consistency.
-Right.

33:19.750 --> 33:21.833
This isn't the makgeolli I know.

33:22.958 --> 33:23.875
And then

33:24.583 --> 33:25.791
the finishing blow.

33:26.375 --> 33:27.541
-Sir.
-Yes.

33:27.625 --> 33:30.833
-We'll take Haechang 12%.
-Haechang 12% coming right out.

33:35.375 --> 33:36.833
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.000
-This is the most…
-The most expensive one here.

33:44.458 --> 33:46.416
Look at the way it pours out. So thick.

33:53.166 --> 33:55.125
-What's this?
-It looks like porridge.

33:55.208 --> 33:57.500
-Yogurt, but more…
-Porridge, it's porridge.

34:16.166 --> 34:17.416
This is good.

34:17.958 --> 34:20.166
It definitely tastes better
as we go higher.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.166
How should I put it?

34:22.250 --> 34:24.833
Well balanced, you know?

34:24.916 --> 34:27.666
Sweetness and other flavors.

34:27.750 --> 34:31.291
There's this heartiness in the sourness.

34:31.875 --> 34:33.500
It's actually really good.

34:36.875 --> 34:37.833
Look.

34:38.416 --> 34:39.833
Look at the texture.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.500
A little thicker and it'd be jelly.

34:42.583 --> 34:44.875
-A little thicker and we'd need a spoon.
-Yes.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.166
MAKGEOLLI BY MAKGEOLLI

35:30.250 --> 35:33.333
Here's the thing about makgeolli.
I enjoy makgeolli.

35:33.416 --> 35:34.375
Sometimes…

35:35.166 --> 35:38.125
I feel like
just guzzling it out of a bowl.

35:38.916 --> 35:41.125
-Like this.
-Right.

35:41.208 --> 35:43.041
There are good makgeolli for that.

35:43.125 --> 35:44.041
Other times,

35:44.125 --> 35:48.083
I want to sip it in a small glass
and enjoy the fragrance.

35:48.166 --> 35:51.125
I think you need
both ends of the spectrum.

35:51.208 --> 35:55.375
-Some widely available.
-Inexpensive and diluted with water.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.541
It's not all about being high-end.

35:57.625 --> 35:59.833
Right, that's how we get a rich selection.

36:07.333 --> 36:09.041
How long did you live in Cheongju?

36:10.500 --> 36:12.000
Until I graduated high school.

36:12.083 --> 36:15.750
So you weren't drinking makgeolli then.

36:15.833 --> 36:16.833
No.

36:16.916 --> 36:19.166
When I visited my grandparents,

36:19.875 --> 36:24.625
I remember my grandfather
used to drink makgeolli.

36:24.708 --> 36:25.583
How?

36:25.666 --> 36:27.250
-In a kettle or….
-Kettle.

36:27.333 --> 36:30.416
Do you know that word?

36:30.500 --> 36:32.458
-Jimbba, a loading bicycle?
-Black bicycle?

36:32.541 --> 36:36.291
When you go deliver the makgeolli,
at the back of the bicycle

36:36.375 --> 36:41.041
you'd hang this big thing
on both sides, by a string of some sort.

36:41.125 --> 36:42.125
Round containers.

36:42.875 --> 36:45.125
They used a glass bottle for a while.

36:45.208 --> 36:48.000
And then a flimsier bottle than this.

36:48.083 --> 36:50.250
A bottle softer than this bottle.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.208
Yes, the one that crumbles easily.

36:53.291 --> 36:55.875
Yes, that lasted some time.

36:55.958 --> 36:57.708
Then this bottle came along.

36:57.791 --> 36:59.416
Then recently, these bottles.

36:59.500 --> 37:01.916
-The bottles changed through time.
-Glass bottle, too.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.125
Some look like milk bottles.

37:04.208 --> 37:05.625
-I've seen one.
-Yes.

37:08.750 --> 37:12.875
So as makgeolli bottles change,

37:12.958 --> 37:15.833
the demand shifts to the younger crowd

37:15.916 --> 37:18.000
and the makers become younger too.

37:18.583 --> 37:20.083
People make makgeolli at home.

37:20.166 --> 37:23.500
I thought makgeolli was exclusive
to our generation

37:23.583 --> 37:25.083
when I made it at home.

37:25.166 --> 37:27.375
At first, I wasn't sure about it

37:27.958 --> 37:29.541
because I'm older than my wife.

37:29.625 --> 37:31.333
But when I was making it at home,

37:31.416 --> 37:34.291
she wasn't looking at me
like I was pathetic.

37:35.000 --> 37:36.333
I thought she might.

37:36.416 --> 37:38.500
She thought it was hip.

37:38.583 --> 37:41.000
She liked trying out
the home-made products.

37:41.083 --> 37:42.791
She can compare the different types.

37:42.875 --> 37:46.708
What I realized from the makgeolli tour

37:46.791 --> 37:48.666
is that there are a lot of young people.

37:48.750 --> 37:51.791
There are a lot of factories, breweries,
and young people.

37:51.875 --> 37:53.208
The consumers, too.

37:53.291 --> 37:55.000
Look around us. All young.

37:55.083 --> 37:57.083
We are probably the oldest here.

37:57.791 --> 37:58.625
You're right.

37:59.458 --> 38:01.041
The consumers matter.

38:01.750 --> 38:04.083
A good menu is created by consumers.

38:04.166 --> 38:05.583
Yes.

38:06.083 --> 38:08.208
The public is the most objective.

38:09.208 --> 38:11.250
We can say many flowery words.

38:11.333 --> 38:12.500
"This is so tasty."

38:12.583 --> 38:14.208
-"Try this."
-It doesn't work.

38:14.750 --> 38:16.666
It works for a moment. They'll try it.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.875
-If it's good, they'll go back.
-Right.

38:19.666 --> 38:21.041
A long time ago,

38:21.583 --> 38:23.333
when I was a novice producer,

38:23.833 --> 38:27.291
I'd monitor my programs
at jjimjilbang and comic book stores.

38:27.375 --> 38:28.208
Why?

38:28.291 --> 38:30.750
You know the old comic book stores?

38:30.833 --> 38:33.416
There'd be a tiny TV up front.

38:33.500 --> 38:35.791
No one'd watch it.
Everyone's busy reading comics.

38:35.875 --> 38:38.458
I'd turn on my program and watch.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.500
And people would look up at the fun parts.

38:41.583 --> 38:42.833
It's amazing.

38:44.875 --> 38:46.833
-Makes sense.
-Their priority is the comics.

38:46.916 --> 38:49.375
-But…
-When TV is more fun, they switch.

38:49.458 --> 38:51.791
They always know when to look up.

38:51.875 --> 38:54.291
Then I know that part really is good.

38:54.833 --> 38:57.541
-You put a lot of effort in.
-Same for jjimjilbang.

38:57.625 --> 39:00.625
There'd be a TV
in the big area in the center.

39:00.708 --> 39:02.416
People talk and chill.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.291
They're off doing their own thing.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.958
And then they'd start gathering

39:07.041 --> 39:08.875
when something fun comes on.

39:08.958 --> 39:10.041
It was amazing.

39:10.125 --> 39:11.083
Same here!

39:11.166 --> 39:13.750
When we launch a new menu or a new store.

39:13.833 --> 39:14.958
I would do this.

39:15.041 --> 39:17.375
I'd stand by the door
and follow the customers.

39:17.458 --> 39:19.500
-Really?
-I did that a lot.

39:19.583 --> 39:20.625
I follow them.

39:20.708 --> 39:23.583
When you ask them in the store,
they'll say everything was good.

39:23.666 --> 39:25.375
When they leave the store…

39:25.458 --> 39:26.875
They start talking.

39:26.958 --> 39:28.625
When they're a couple of steps away.

39:28.708 --> 39:31.000
"That was delicious. How much was it?"

39:31.666 --> 39:33.291
That's the first thing they ask.

39:33.375 --> 39:34.791
Cost performance.

39:34.875 --> 39:36.833
Then they'd say something like
"24,000 won."

39:36.916 --> 39:39.458
"Dang, that's cheap." Things like that.

39:39.541 --> 39:40.458
Then the price is set.

39:40.541 --> 39:44.041
That's my source.
I follow and listen like a spy.

39:45.166 --> 39:47.250
-Right.
-Like in the comic store.

39:47.333 --> 39:48.333
I did that, too.

39:50.125 --> 39:52.083
We're constantly judged by people,

39:52.166 --> 39:54.375
but that's part of what makes it fun.

39:56.583 --> 39:57.458
There's a thrill.

39:58.291 --> 39:59.666
Because if you follow them

39:59.750 --> 40:02.208
and they say, "That was amazing!"

40:02.291 --> 40:04.250
-That's exciting.
-It's electrifying.

40:05.250 --> 40:08.291
That's what pushes you
to make new programs, right?

40:08.791 --> 40:10.916
-Yes, that thrill.
-Me too.

40:11.000 --> 40:13.833
Those moments
are my motivation for new brands.

40:28.125 --> 40:30.375
Things must've changed

40:31.041 --> 40:33.416
for you

40:33.916 --> 40:36.625
since you started this job.

40:36.708 --> 40:38.208
-Now…
-A lot has changed.

40:38.291 --> 40:41.291
You know how people say,
"Team Nah Yung-suk."

40:44.000 --> 40:46.041
How many now? A lot, right?

40:46.125 --> 40:47.916
I've got about 50.

40:49.791 --> 40:51.166
When I do the programs…

40:52.083 --> 40:56.750
When I have two a year,
I'd do everything myself.

40:56.833 --> 40:59.791
But now I've got teams.

40:59.875 --> 41:03.208
I can tell someone,
"Take Youn's Kitchen this time."

41:04.208 --> 41:06.666
Or "Take Three Meals a Day this time."

41:06.750 --> 41:08.375
They would be co-produced.

41:08.458 --> 41:10.083
And there are difficulties.

41:10.166 --> 41:12.583
Like, I can't do everything 100% my way.

41:12.666 --> 41:16.708
Because they have their opinions
and their idea of Youn's Kitchen

41:16.791 --> 41:20.375
could be different
from what I started with.

41:20.458 --> 41:21.291
Then,

41:22.000 --> 41:26.416
there are parts that I need to accept,

41:26.500 --> 41:31.291
and sometimes I need to properly advise.

41:33.041 --> 41:37.458
It took years for me to find the balance.

41:39.041 --> 41:40.250
This balance.

41:40.333 --> 41:42.250
-In my mind…
-Yes.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.375
I want to control everything.

41:44.458 --> 41:47.750
On the other hand, that producer's idea

41:47.833 --> 41:50.833
could become more fruitful at the end.

41:51.666 --> 41:53.750
And I could be in their way

41:53.833 --> 41:55.833
with my old, stuffy ideas.

41:56.791 --> 41:59.500
I get conflicted
in that cycle of thoughts.

42:00.166 --> 42:02.708
Yes, it's similar for me at my company.

42:04.625 --> 42:07.041
When I started the business,

42:07.125 --> 42:09.625
it wasn't always
this big in the beginning.

42:09.708 --> 42:12.625
At first, I'd have to handle everything.

42:13.166 --> 42:15.375
I needed to micromanage everything.

42:15.458 --> 42:18.541
I thought I had to be there
every step of the way.

42:18.625 --> 42:19.583
But after a while,

42:19.666 --> 42:22.166
I would say,
"You are in the consumer age group."

42:22.250 --> 42:24.291
"Your opinion is critical."

42:24.375 --> 42:26.375
I started relying more on them.

42:26.958 --> 42:29.125
At first, I tried to do everything myself.

42:29.208 --> 42:31.916
-At first, you knew everything.
-Right.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.291
And you'd ask, just because.

42:33.375 --> 42:34.916
-Right.
-To see if they knew.

42:35.000 --> 42:38.000
But now you're asking because you need to.

42:38.083 --> 42:40.666
Now, I'm more conscious
of what they think.

42:42.500 --> 42:44.500
It's similar for me too.

42:50.750 --> 42:53.000
I don't know how to put this.

42:58.125 --> 42:59.291
Gradually…

42:59.833 --> 43:01.375
-From my perspective…
-Yes.

43:04.375 --> 43:05.458
I'm getting smaller.

43:09.041 --> 43:09.958
Same here.

43:10.041 --> 43:13.291
At first I was trying to act all humble,

43:14.041 --> 43:17.250
but now I'm actually dwindling.

43:17.333 --> 43:21.125
And when the day finally comes

43:21.791 --> 43:24.333
that I've become too small,

43:24.416 --> 43:27.166
-I'll have to step down.
-You think about that.

43:27.250 --> 43:29.333
-Yes, I do.
-Same for me.

43:29.833 --> 43:32.958
I never even thought about retiring
until recently.

43:33.041 --> 43:34.416
We're the same.

43:34.916 --> 43:38.833
Because there will come a time
when their ideas will be better.

43:38.916 --> 43:42.291
At a point,
none of my ideas will be good enough

43:42.375 --> 43:44.750
and the program
will revolve around their ideas.

43:44.833 --> 43:48.041
When that time comes,
I don't need to be around.

43:48.125 --> 43:51.291
I'll stay
for as long as I am helpful to them.

43:51.875 --> 43:54.875
Whether that means helping them
meld their ideas together

43:54.958 --> 43:56.500
or adding a new component.

43:56.583 --> 43:58.416
I play an active part.

43:58.500 --> 44:02.583
But when they become good enough
to do that on their own,

44:04.208 --> 44:05.041
in reality,

44:05.750 --> 44:07.000
I should step back.

44:07.583 --> 44:09.500
-That's how I feel.
-Same for me.

44:10.875 --> 44:13.708
I created the company
so I thought I had to stick around.

44:13.791 --> 44:17.166
But at a certain point,
my position gets smaller and smaller.

44:18.166 --> 44:20.833
I start thinking, "They are right."

44:20.916 --> 44:25.083
"Rather than having
my poor choices mislead them,

44:25.166 --> 44:28.125
I should step back at a certain point

44:28.208 --> 44:29.791
and eventually retire."

44:29.875 --> 44:31.375
To sustain the organization.

44:31.458 --> 44:32.500
What you just said.

44:32.583 --> 44:35.625
-I couldn't agree more.
-A bit tragic, isn't it?

44:35.708 --> 44:36.750
That my decisions

44:36.833 --> 44:38.458
-could mislead them.
-Right.

44:39.500 --> 44:41.250
I feel very much the same.

44:46.166 --> 44:48.083
When I was alone, it was simple.

44:48.875 --> 44:50.041
Responsible for myself.

44:50.125 --> 44:52.333
If I do well, great. If not, too bad.

44:52.833 --> 44:55.541
But as the team grows
and the family grows,

44:55.625 --> 44:56.916
and the older I get,

44:58.083 --> 45:00.000
the more worries I have.

45:14.291 --> 45:17.375
This is what's good about makgeolli.
It gets you drunk slowly.

45:17.916 --> 45:19.333
-Right.
-Others get you faster.

45:19.416 --> 45:21.541
We talk for a while
before knowing we're drunk.

45:22.250 --> 45:23.083
Right?

45:23.583 --> 45:26.250
The buzz comes subtly and slowly
as we talk and drink.

45:30.458 --> 45:31.750
Thank you.

45:31.833 --> 45:33.083
I'll pour for you.

45:34.833 --> 45:36.166
I'll shake it once.

45:40.458 --> 45:41.625
Cheers.

46:02.333 --> 46:04.666
When you were in college,

46:04.750 --> 46:08.166
didn't you have part-time jobs
and businesses gone south?

46:08.250 --> 46:09.083
To be honest,

46:10.250 --> 46:11.083
I liked money.

46:13.500 --> 46:16.500
I opened a restaurant by chance

46:18.541 --> 46:21.291
and it was merely
a means for making money.

46:21.916 --> 46:24.125
But I went bankrupt once.

46:24.208 --> 46:26.291
As you go down, you start seeing clearly.

46:27.500 --> 46:29.458
Money was good,
but other things became fun.

46:29.541 --> 46:30.791
Interacting with customers.

46:30.875 --> 46:32.833
Developing a menu with food I like.

46:32.916 --> 46:34.416
Selling that menu. It was fun.

46:34.500 --> 46:37.125
-That's what you actually liked.
-I just didn't know.

46:37.208 --> 46:38.333
Now I know.

46:38.416 --> 46:40.708
I changed as I got back on my feet.

46:40.791 --> 46:43.666
That's why on TV

46:43.750 --> 46:46.125
they're talking about me
donating this and that.

46:46.916 --> 46:49.041
I found a greater value than money.

46:49.125 --> 46:50.833
In a way,

46:51.625 --> 46:53.875
your outlook on life changed

46:54.625 --> 46:57.833
as you started coming on TV programs.

46:57.916 --> 46:58.916
-By bits.
-It changed.

46:59.000 --> 47:00.833
The TV programs helped, for sure.

47:00.916 --> 47:02.208
If it wasn't for TV programs

47:02.291 --> 47:04.750
I may have learned this later, or never.

47:04.833 --> 47:07.250
You'd be an evil businessman instead?

47:08.291 --> 47:09.125
Wily.

47:09.625 --> 47:10.666
Wily businessman.
