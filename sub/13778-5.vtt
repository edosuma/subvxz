WEBVTT

00:01.418 --> 00:02.919
(car alarm blaring)

00:02.961 --> 00:05.077
(horn honks)

00:08.425 --> 00:09.835
— (radar beeps)
— 11 clicks over?

00:09.885 --> 00:11.295
Pass.

00:14.473 --> 00:15.838
Illegal lane change?

00:16.850 --> 00:18.226
Pass.

00:18.268 --> 00:20.054
(sighs)

00:20.103 --> 00:21.684
Getting bored yet, Epstein?

00:21.730 --> 00:23.937
No, ma'am.
I'm still on probation,

00:23.982 --> 00:28.351
so I am happy to just watch,
learn and keep my mouth shut.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.436
You familiar
with this neighborhood?

00:31.490 --> 00:33.731
Yeah, 70% live
below the poverty line.

00:33.784 --> 00:36.070
Low—income families living
in social housing communities.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.700
Ghettos.

00:37.746 --> 00:40.283
So what happens if we give
these drivers a ticket?

00:40.332 --> 00:42.698
Uh, it goes on their driving record.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.207
Their insurance goes up.

00:44.253 --> 00:46.710
And if they can't pay
their insurance?

00:46.755 --> 00:48.996
— They can't drive.
— Mm—hmm.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.665
Lots of hardworking folks
in this neighborhood——

00:51.718 --> 00:55.961
folks that need to drive to work
in order to pay their bills.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.424
You gotta think big picture.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.466
(engine revving, radar beeps)

01:00.519 --> 01:02.009
Oh, no, they didn't.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.302
Oh, yes, they did.

01:03.355 --> 01:04.595
(siren whoops)

01:04.648 --> 01:08.607
(siren wailing, tires peel)

01:10.237 --> 01:11.477
(Noelle) I'll be right back.

01:11.530 --> 01:15.443
(police radio chatter)

01:15.492 --> 01:17.357
Talk to the girlfriend
while I run this guy.

01:17.411 --> 01:18.901
She seems a little jumpy.

01:23.166 --> 01:25.657
Evening, miss. How you doin'?

01:25.711 --> 01:27.417
I'm good.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.748
And where are you two
headed tonight?

01:29.798 --> 01:31.413
We're going out...to dinner.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.137
Really? Fantastic.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.340
I would kill for a souvlaki right now.

01:38.390 --> 01:41.223
My shift's not over
for another hour or so.

01:44.980 --> 01:46.936
— What restaurant you headed to?
— l have drugs in my bra!

01:49.276 --> 01:51.232
Noelle! Take the girl!
She's holding!

01:51.278 --> 01:52.233
(Dov) Hey!

01:52.279 --> 01:54.110
Hands up! Hands up!

02:00.078 --> 02:02.490
Police! You're under arrest!

02:02.539 --> 02:05.656
— (whoosh)
— (grunts)

02:05.709 --> 02:06.698
Ohh!

02:08.211 --> 02:10.247
— You shot me!
— No, I did not!

02:10.297 --> 02:12.834
(groans) I can't believe you shot me!

02:12.883 --> 02:14.248
Shut up!

02:14.301 --> 02:16.508
(spits)

02:18.513 --> 02:19.889
This is Epstein.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.422
I'm in the Crawford
Co—op playground.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.683
— Suspect's in custody.
(squelch)

02:24.728 --> 02:26.184
Hey!

02:26.229 --> 02:27.969
Don't move. Come here!

02:33.111 --> 02:34.146
You shoot this man?

02:34.196 --> 02:35.481
You told him to stop.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.486
My mom said people
should listen to the cops.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.523
Your mom's a smart lady.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.861
I'm gonna have to take
that slingshot.

02:40.911 --> 02:42.447
Aw, man.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.111
Now go home. Get outta here.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.450
And no more hanging around
playgrounds after dark.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.085
Hey.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.662
Thanks for the backup.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.668
(man groaning)

03:01.139 --> 03:03.346
— What's going on with him?
— Bee sting.

03:03.392 --> 03:06.930
Well, ain't karma a bitch?
(chuckles)

03:06.978 --> 03:08.388
Come on.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.974
A bee sting. (chuckles)

03:10.023 --> 03:13.015
(siren wailing)

03:15.612 --> 03:18.604
(police radio chatter)

03:20.701 --> 03:22.987
(Chris) You took down
a guy with five warrants.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.446
That's gotta be
some sort of record.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.032
Are we going to Black Penny
to celebrate?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.992
Uh, no, thank you.
I'm just gonna head home.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.417
Want to get a good night's sleep

03:29.459 --> 03:31.370
if I'm gonna keep
my performance consistent.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.581
10—4, Officer Buzzkill.

03:33.630 --> 03:34.961
Oh, and, uh, hey,

03:35.006 --> 03:37.463
try not to make too much noise
when you come in tonight.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.357
Dex packed his bags,

03:56.403 --> 03:57.893
said he didn't want
to live a lie anymore.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.061
Drama queen.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.859
Him. Not you, obviously.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.570
From now on, I'm gonna
live in the moment.

04:04.619 --> 04:07.156
No more going backwards
to make other people happy.

04:07.205 --> 04:09.036
Sounds like a really good plan, Trace.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.243
— You good?
— Yeah, I'm good.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.041
Ready to go?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.872
— Have a good night, okay?
— (yawns) Uh—huh.

04:14.921 --> 04:17.207
— And get some sleep.
— Uh—huh.

04:17.257 --> 04:20.624
(Telekinesis)
J‘ Na, na, na—na—na, na, na J‘

04:20.677 --> 04:24.295
J‘ Na, na, na—na—na, na, na J‘

04:24.347 --> 04:27.305
J‘ Come down, come quickly J‘

04:27.350 --> 04:30.717
J‘ Look at the lights
in the big city J‘

04:30.771 --> 04:34.059
J‘ Sewers smoking, what the hell? J‘

04:34.107 --> 04:35.438
J‘ Is it toxic? I can't tell... J‘

04:35.484 --> 04:36.815
(lowers volume)

04:36.860 --> 04:39.476
Is that what the kids
are listening to now?

04:39.529 --> 04:41.269
My physical's in six days.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.063
I'm still two minutes slower
than last month.

04:43.116 --> 04:44.401
Yeah, well, you didn't have
three belly buttons

04:44.451 --> 04:45.486
last month, did you?

04:45.535 --> 04:47.446
— (chuckles)
— (treadmill beeps)

04:47.496 --> 04:50.579
J‘ I know this is going to last J‘

04:50.624 --> 04:51.784
J‘ Turn it up... J‘

04:51.833 --> 04:53.209
How's it feeling?

04:53.251 --> 04:54.661
Like I'm gonna ace my physical.

04:54.711 --> 04:56.667
Yeah?

04:56.713 --> 04:58.795
God, you're sexy
when you're sweaty.

04:58.840 --> 05:00.250
— Yeah?
— Yeah.

05:00.300 --> 05:04.009
Then, uh, maybe we should
get married in Jamaica.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.840
I'm really, really sexy
in Jamaica.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.345
— We could. My parents eloped.
— Mm—hmm.

05:07.390 --> 05:09.676
Got up in the middle of the night
and drove to Niagara Falls.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.388
— Yeah, it worked out really well for them.
— (chuckles)

05:12.437 --> 05:14.553
I know I want my dad to come,
but I haven't decided

05:14.606 --> 05:16.642
if I want to invite my mom
to the wedding yet.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.104
You know you don't have to.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.393
I don't know. ljust feel like

05:21.446 --> 05:24.529
maybe I should give her
another shot. Mm.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.075
I don't know.

05:27.536 --> 05:28.776
| just don't want to see you
get hurt, babe.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.616
I mean, to me,
it seems she made her choice

05:31.665 --> 05:33.621
when she walked out, right?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.578
I guess so.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.709
Hey, if you want to mend that fence,

05:37.754 --> 05:39.290
wedding's a perfect excuse.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.455
Once—in—a—lifetime opportunity, huh?

05:41.508 --> 05:43.044
Yeah. Depends how many times
| get married.

05:43.093 --> 05:45.300
(both chuckle)

05:45.345 --> 05:47.961
All right, I'm gonna be late.
I gotta go.

05:49.432 --> 05:51.093
— Take it easy, all right?
— Yeah.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.966
— You're on the mend.
— Yeah.

05:54.604 --> 05:57.095
J‘ I said, "Turn it up, turn it up" J‘

05:57.148 --> 05:58.934
— (treadmill beeps)
— J‘ Whoa, oh J‘

05:58.984 --> 06:00.940
(sniffs) On the mend, eh?

06:00.986 --> 06:03.648
J‘ Yeah J‘

06:03.697 --> 06:06.609
Thanks to Epstein and Williams,

06:06.658 --> 06:09.070
we got a serial lawbreaker
off the street last night.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.484
(scattered cheers and applause)

06:10.537 --> 06:13.153
Today we're going to build
on that success.

06:13.206 --> 06:17.745
All of these fine citizens
have outstanding warrants,

06:17.794 --> 06:19.409
and today we're gonna
get 'em off our streets

06:19.462 --> 06:20.713
and into a cell.

06:22.299 --> 06:24.540
Go ahead.
Ask me how we're gonna get 'em.

06:24.593 --> 06:25.924
How are we gonna get them?

06:25.969 --> 06:28.551
— We're gonna run a sting.
— (man) Yeah!

06:28.597 --> 06:30.553
Sunray Motors is opening
their new dealership on Monday,

06:30.599 --> 06:33.090
but today,
they're lending it to us.

06:33.143 --> 06:37.477
Nash, Peck, McNally,
make the prize notification calls.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.762
Use any numbers we have on file.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.601
Well, good morning, Mr. Wilcox.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.151
This is Sunray Motors calling,

06:42.193 --> 06:44.354
congratulating you on becoming
our grand—prize winner.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.940
Mr. Coglin, your son has been

06:45.989 --> 06:48.150
randomly selected
as our grand—prize winner.

06:48.199 --> 06:50.861
All he has to do is come
into our new showroom.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.323
And I will personally hand you
the keys to a new car.

06:53.371 --> 06:54.952
It's that simple, Mrs. Shapiro.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.408
(Traci) We close at 6:00.
Is there any way to bring him in?

06:56.458 --> 06:57.447
(engine starts)

07:00.420 --> 07:03.207
(Frank) Swarek is running point on this,

07:03.256 --> 07:05.633
and he'll have the showroom
ready to go.

07:09.346 --> 07:11.678
The back room is gonna be
the command post.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.465
Williams and Shaw,
they'll be running surveillance.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.685
Everyone in the showroom
will be wearing earpieces.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.062
You will be miked.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.893
(Oliver) Check. Check.

07:22.943 --> 07:23.932
Check.

07:26.321 --> 07:29.563
Now the teams are
Swarek, Epstein,

07:29.616 --> 07:32.153
(thump, thump)
— Nash, McNally,

07:32.202 --> 07:34.067
Diaz and Peck.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.958
(chk)
There you are.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.834
(Frank) Some of the suspects
will be suspicious,

07:43.880 --> 07:45.962
and they may not want
to give up their names.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.042
(Oliver) Showroom is hot.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.423
— Thank you, brother.
— You bet.

07:48.468 --> 07:49.457
Cheers, my friend.

07:49.511 --> 07:50.796
And some of the customers

07:50.845 --> 07:53.052
may not be people
who we are looking for.

07:53.098 --> 07:55.384
They might be civilians in
off the streets,

07:55.433 --> 07:57.298
so you have to stall
as long as you can

07:57.352 --> 07:59.934
while Noelle and Oliver
try to make a visual.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.689
Once this happens, you will hear
the signal in your earpieces.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.109
What is the signal?

08:05.151 --> 08:06.106
"Bohemian Rhapsody."

08:06.152 --> 08:08.404
When you hear the signal,

08:08.446 --> 08:10.653
you get 'em into the office,
get 'em outta sight,

08:10.699 --> 08:12.564
— make the arrest. We clear?
— (all) Yes, sir.

08:12.617 --> 08:15.700
All right, let's serve, protect,
get these asses off our streets.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.360
(Oliver, Noelle, and Sam) Hooah!

08:17.414 --> 08:19.120
"Bohemian Rhapsody."

08:23.253 --> 08:26.495
You showed a lot of character
taking your lumps, Epstein.

08:26.548 --> 08:28.709
It would be a mistake
keeping you on probation.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.841
Really? I mean, thank you.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.467
Um, before you go, |, uh——

08:33.513 --> 08:35.720
I saw a posting
for the mounted unit training.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.346
l was thinking about applying.

08:39.102 --> 08:39.932
Williams.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.472
Epstein, uh, wants to apply
for the mounted unit training.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.639
What do you think?

08:45.692 --> 08:47.398
I think he's got his mojo back.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.526
But I'm still not crazy
about the haircut.

08:49.571 --> 08:51.732
Keep your nose clean,
and I might even recommend you.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.066
Thank you, sir.

08:54.784 --> 08:56.285
Hey, Noelle.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.407
Are we still on for tonight?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.570
Oh, yeah, yeah. Dinner.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.204
Uh, but I know with stings,
there's lots of papenNork,

09:02.250 --> 09:04.332
so we don't have to do it.
Do it another time.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.038
I'm gonna have to eat eventually.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.086
All right.
See you after shift.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.541
All right.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.957
You've won quite the prize here,
Mr. Tremblay.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.548
This subcompact
is a cut above the rest.

09:15.597 --> 09:19.431
— lt's edgy and sophisticated...
— (Dov) ...big backseat.

09:19.476 --> 09:20.807
Perfect for a new family.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.433
This is our first.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.344
Could you show me
where the car seat straps go?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.308
Of course, Mrs. Tremblay.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.143
| just need to see some,
uh, identification, Barry.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.902
I wouldn't want the, uh,

09:32.947 --> 09:34.483
— grand prize to go...
— Got a Barry Tremblay?

09:34.532 --> 09:36.363
...to the wrong person.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.240
Warrant for——

09:38.286 --> 09:40.868
Oh, failure to pay child support.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.155
Ah, a deadbeat dad
to one kid already.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.164
(clicks tongue) Man.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.541
(Oliver) Bohemian Rhapsody.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.826
(Dov) I believe this is
the child safety tab.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.369
If you'd care to step
into the office,

09:49.422 --> 09:51.003
I can show you
the collision test results.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.289
They're quite remarkable.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.708
That'll put her mind at ease, yeah.
Angie, come on.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.717
Maybe you should read the manual.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.671
(Easy listening music
playing over PA)

10:01.601 --> 10:02.932
(Sam) Right this way.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.266
All right.

10:11.402 --> 10:13.017
(Oliver) Barry Tremblay,
congratulations.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.778
You're under arrest for failure
to pay child support.

10:15.824 --> 10:18.691
Man, Swarek——so awesome.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.404
He's like a method cop.

10:20.453 --> 10:21.568
(scoffs)

10:21.621 --> 10:23.737
Aw, you got
a little man crush, Dov?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.997
No, it's just, you know,
he's so good at his job

10:26.042 --> 10:28.784
that | feel like I learn so much
just being around him.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.122
Totally get it, man.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.171
Oh, come on. Like you don't know
exactly what I'm talking about.

10:33.216 --> 10:35.582
You all do.
I know Andy does.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.000
You get to ride with him all the time.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.168
Okay, we get it.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.552
You want to marry Swarek, Dov.

10:39.597 --> 10:40.632
Let's move on.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.468
Hey, so I was just wondering,

10:42.517 --> 10:44.303
uh, you know, I haven't got
an invitation in the mail

10:44.352 --> 10:47.765
or anything, but, uh, you're
still getting married, right?

10:47.814 --> 10:50.726
Because I bought
a really, really expensive suit,

10:50.775 --> 10:52.481
and I'm pretty sure
I lost the receipt to it.

10:52.527 --> 10:53.858
Yes, we're still getting married.

10:53.903 --> 10:55.814
Luke and | just have
a few details to work out

10:55.864 --> 10:56.819
before we set the date.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.527
(door alert chimes)

10:59.576 --> 11:00.986
We'll get this one.

11:02.495 --> 11:06.238
(Chris whispers) Ow. Ow. Ow. What?
I was just trying to...

11:06.291 --> 11:07.701
Welcome to Sunray Motors.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.957
You must be one
of our grand—prize winners.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.665
Yeah. Actually, I'm here to pick up
the prize for my brother.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.419
I can't believe this.
How could you do this to me?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.424
I've never been
more humiliated in my life.

11:19.470 --> 11:21.461
I'm gonna take the house.
I'm gonna take the car.

11:21.514 --> 11:22.970
We still get the car, right?

11:23.016 --> 11:24.972
— (Sam) Uh, no.
— No? I'm gonna take everything.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.974
The dog is coming with me.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.430
— I'm keeping my ring.
— Bye.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.434
(Angie) Why should I go in here?

11:29.480 --> 11:30.640
I'm not a criminal.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.681
Unfortunately,
we can't actually, you know,

11:32.734 --> 11:35.897
give the prize away
to anyone but the winner,

11:35.945 --> 11:38.561
— Mr,, uh...
— Say what?

11:38.615 --> 11:41.197
Uh, are you sure your brother
can't make it in today?

11:41.242 --> 11:43.699
Yeah. He's out of town
all week, you know?

11:43.745 --> 11:46.578
Oh, well, maybe I can get him
on the phone. What's his name?

11:48.041 --> 11:49.577
His name's Dominic.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.413
Uh, but you know what?
Uh, Dominic Summers.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.544
But never mind. You know,
maybe I should, uh, come back.

11:54.589 --> 11:56.671
You got anything yet?
This guy is gonna bolt.

11:56.716 --> 11:59.674
No Dominic. No Summers.
No visual match.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.754
(Gail) There's no hassle.

12:00.803 --> 12:03.840
(grunts and sighs)

12:03.890 --> 12:05.551
(man) Well, my brother,
you know...

12:05.600 --> 12:08.307
All right, hey.

12:08.353 --> 12:11.561
What about this?

12:11.606 --> 12:13.688
(man) I like that silver one.
That one's sharp.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.354
— It's nice.
— You want the keys?

12:17.403 --> 12:18.779
Well, yeah, but, uh...
(Noelle) Tony Franklin,

12:18.821 --> 12:20.812
two breach of recogs,
failure to appear.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.605
Yeah, brother, my ass.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.274
I'm really sorry.
I'll come back with my brother.

12:24.327 --> 12:25.942
It's gonna be awesome,
all right? See ya.

12:25.995 --> 12:26.950
(Oliver) Bohemian Rhapsody.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.281
Mr. Summers.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.663
— (shoes squeak)
— You know what?

12:30.708 --> 12:34.292
Um, your brother shouldn't lose out
over a technicality.

12:35.046 --> 12:38.038
I'm sure I can convince my manager
to release the prize to you.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.501
Oh, yeah?

12:39.550 --> 12:40.539
Yeah.

12:41.803 --> 12:42.963
For real, huh?

12:43.012 --> 12:44.092
Yeah.

12:46.057 --> 12:48.048
— A'ight.
— (chuckles)

12:48.101 --> 12:49.637
— Yeah, let's do that.
— Right this way.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.096
Nice tie, man.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.134
Thanks.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.854
You're very personable.

12:54.899 --> 12:55.888
| get that a lot.

12:55.942 --> 12:57.432
(Andy) Hmm.

12:57.485 --> 12:58.474
— Nice.
— (door alert chimes)

12:59.904 --> 13:01.815
(Andy) Ah, here we go.

13:03.825 --> 13:05.736
(door alert chimes)

13:07.620 --> 13:09.360
All right, uh, you guys
take the librarian,

13:09.414 --> 13:10.995
and,uh,
we'll take fancy pants.

13:11.040 --> 13:12.576
Okay.

13:15.586 --> 13:18.749
Good morning. Welcome to
Sunray Motors' grand opening.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.413
Well, |——| got a call on my cell.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.081
A woman said I won a car.

13:22.135 --> 13:25.844
Well, then you must be one
of our grand—prize winners.

13:25.888 --> 13:28.345
Congratulations, uh, Miss...

13:28.391 --> 13:30.097
Senett. Mrs. Leigh Senett.

13:30.143 --> 13:33.135
Are you sure I won?
I've never won anything in my life.

13:33.187 --> 13:34.597
— You got a Leigh Senett?
— (Andy) We're sure.

13:34.647 --> 13:35.853
— Leigh Senett.
— You want to take a look

13:35.898 --> 13:37.274
— at the car right now?
— Leigh Senett.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.603
Someone should've
paid her bills on time.

13:39.652 --> 13:43.144
You know, I'm kinda thinking
of changing the code word.

13:43.197 --> 13:45.062
I'm very bored with this one.

13:45.116 --> 13:46.731
What do you think of
"StainNay to Heaven"?

13:46.784 --> 13:48.570
— (Sam) Okay, no problem.
— Really?

13:48.619 --> 13:50.780
Bohemian Rhapsody.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.821
(Oliver) Bohemian Rhapsody.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.741
You know, if you'll just
step into the back office,

13:55.793 --> 13:58.455
we will have you on the road
in your brand—new car in no time.

13:58.504 --> 14:00.335
Can I see the engine?

14:01.174 --> 14:02.334
— Sure.
— Okay.

14:02.383 --> 14:04.169
Well, my car barely works anymore.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.960
I spend more time trying to fix it
than driving it.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.924
I'd just love to see
a brand—new engine.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.055
Sure. Yeah. That's——

14:11.100 --> 14:12.180
— Come on.
— Thanks.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.394
This is, uh, tricky.
(chuckles)

14:20.443 --> 14:21.603
Yeah.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.728
Ohh.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.441
There it is.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.951
Dual... Mm—hmm.

14:31.996 --> 14:33.657
How long is this gonna take?

14:33.706 --> 14:35.617
Come on. Let me show you
what you won, okay?

14:35.666 --> 14:38.157
— Come on. Come on.
— Right this way, sir.

14:38.211 --> 14:42.079
Sir, come here. Check this out,
all right? (laughs)

14:42.131 --> 14:44.873
You're looking
at a 2.6—liter engine, in—line,

14:44.926 --> 14:48.669
4—cylinder, dual overhead cams
with 158—horsepower.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.758
She might look small,
but she's got teeth, you know?

14:52.600 --> 14:54.636
I like my cars
with a little panache.

14:54.685 --> 14:58.143
A little panache.
Well, she comes in Barcelona Red.

14:58.189 --> 15:00.180
— Mm.
— Okay?

15:01.359 --> 15:03.771
(Leigh) I do. I do.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.356
(Chris) Another one bites the dust.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.236
(Sam laughs)

15:07.281 --> 15:10.409
You know, if he'd stop doing
laps around the car,

15:10.451 --> 15:11.861
I could get a better look at him.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.071
'Cause it's the bottom
on the car, hey,

15:13.121 --> 15:14.531
we're gonna throw in metal rims.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.116
— Attaboy, Sammy.
— You're gonna get this off

15:16.165 --> 15:17.450
with a bang,
you know what I'm sayin'?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.660
(man) Oh, I know
what you're saying.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.245
— Yeah?
— Yeah.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.000
Marco Forlan.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.126
Possession warrants.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.958
Ah, busted.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.962
— Yeah, I do.
— (Oliver) Bohemian Rhapsody.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.672
What are the rules?
Can I sell it?

15:30.721 --> 15:32.177
Uh, if you'd like to step
into our office,

15:32.223 --> 15:34.384
we'd be happy to show you
all the paperwork.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.594
I don't want to see the papenNork.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.680
I want you to tell me the rules.

15:38.729 --> 15:39.684
Well, the rules are simple.
Basically——

15:39.730 --> 15:41.470
Whoa, not you. Him.

15:42.859 --> 15:45.271
— Uh, well...
— You know what?

15:45.319 --> 15:47.446
I think I prefer to take public transit.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.524
Live green, save the world,

15:49.574 --> 15:51.030
and hug a tree, et cetera.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.064
We got a runner.

15:56.205 --> 15:57.490
— Try me.
— (door alert chimes)

16:02.253 --> 16:04.335
— (groans)
— Marco Forlan,

16:04.380 --> 16:07.838
you're under arrest
for drug possession warrants

16:07.884 --> 16:10.751
and also
almost messing up my suit.

16:10.803 --> 16:13.419
— Come on. Get up.
— (handcuffs click)

16:13.473 --> 16:14.679
I knew you were cops.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.931
Yeah? I knew you were dirty.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.093
Diaz, Epstein, you want
to get Mr. Forlan outta here

16:20.146 --> 16:22.432
and into his cell before
he blows this whole thing?

16:22.482 --> 16:24.063
(Chris) Yes, sir.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.605
(door alert chimes)

16:28.654 --> 16:30.190
Okay, everyone okay?
What's going on?

16:30.239 --> 16:31.945
Um...

16:31.991 --> 16:33.106
- Uh...
— What?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.444
What's going on, McNally?

16:34.494 --> 16:37.156
— Nothing. We lost a suspect.
— You what?

16:37.205 --> 16:38.490
She must've slipped out
during the takedown.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.531
She's gone,
but she left this, so...

16:43.127 --> 16:45.038
If Frank finds out
you two lost a suspect,

16:45.087 --> 16:46.793
the only undercover assignment
you're gonna get

16:46.839 --> 16:49.672
is Mr. and Mrs. Claus
at the divisional Christmas party.

16:49.717 --> 16:52.675
Go. Find her now before
she tells every deadbeat in town

16:52.720 --> 16:54.711
— we're doing a sting.
— Okay.

16:54.764 --> 16:56.629
(door alert chimes)

16:56.682 --> 16:58.092
Huh!

17:01.229 --> 17:03.015
(whirring)

17:04.190 --> 17:06.146
(doorbell rings)

17:13.616 --> 17:15.527
You look like hell.

17:15.576 --> 17:16.816
Can I come in?

17:16.869 --> 17:18.609
No.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.703
Nice place.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.462
Wheatgrass shake?

17:29.507 --> 17:30.462
God, no.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.248
Have a seat.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.292
Meet Joseph Kadour.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.131
He's not really my type.

17:36.180 --> 17:39.672
He's in the city today
to sell 200 forged passports.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.101
We were supposed
to have four on him,

17:41.143 --> 17:43.680
but, uh, Shepherd threw out
his back at Aquafit.

17:43.729 --> 17:47.347
(laughs) So I thought,
uh, you might be interested.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.265
I haven't been cleared
to come back yet.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.274
But you have been cleared
for light duty, 'cause I checked.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.361
Come on. What happened

17:54.407 --> 17:56.819
to Detective Luke Callaghan,
Homicide?

17:56.867 --> 17:59.404
He's on the mend.

17:59.453 --> 18:01.580
Kadour's making the drop
at the Edinboro Hotel.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.032
— Edinboro. Fancy.
— (laughs)

18:03.082 --> 18:07.325
Look, they have good police rates,
and we know the security team.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.663
Don't change the subject.

18:08.713 --> 18:12.706
Look, all we need to do is
bust Kadour with the passports.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.794
Okay? Then we'll sneak you back
into this nursing home.

18:14.844 --> 18:16.300
You go back to being on the mend.

18:17.888 --> 18:20.755
Okay. 17th floor, room 154.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.389
Oh, bring coffees for the guys.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.051
Uh, two double—double,
one regular with cream,

18:25.104 --> 18:28.392
and, uh, you already know
howl like mine.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.602
(chuckles)

18:30.651 --> 18:33.063
(handcuffs click)

18:35.197 --> 18:36.812
Give us the name of your counsel.

18:36.866 --> 18:39.027
— We'll arrange a phone call.
— No, thanks.

18:40.369 --> 18:41.745
Are you waiving your right to counsel?

18:41.787 --> 18:43.652
Whatever's easiest for you.

18:43.706 --> 18:45.697
| just have one simple request.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.907
We're not your concierge.

18:47.960 --> 18:50.827
All I want is two minutes
with one of your detectives.

18:50.880 --> 18:54.168
No. Our detectives are busy
right now, Mr. Forlan.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.252
Well, when they've got a minute then.

18:56.302 --> 18:59.009
— Yeah, well, we'll see.
— (lock clicks)

18:59.055 --> 19:01.467
(man) Phil, if you get a word
out of this guy,

19:01.515 --> 19:02.595
— let me know, all right?
— (clicks tongue)

19:02.642 --> 19:03.677
(door release buzzes,beeps)

19:03.726 --> 19:05.341
Let's see if Jerry's busy.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.182
Dov, an arrestee's rights don't include
chatting with detectives for fun.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.062
In court, he says we didn't
let him talk to a lawyer.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.064
Jerry can testify
that he waived his call

19:13.110 --> 19:14.941
for a face—to—face
with a detective.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.363
— (buzzer sounds)
— I'm impressed.

19:16.405 --> 19:17.861
l'm impressive.

19:18.866 --> 19:21.027
(Traci) If we came out here in these
"Cagney & Lacey" get—ups

19:21.077 --> 19:22.567
and she is not home, so help me...

19:22.620 --> 19:24.861
She is gonna be home
because I need a win today.

19:24.914 --> 19:27.075
l have not slept well in eight nights.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.206
Ooh. Late, steamy nights
in fiancé land?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.378
— No. Well, yeah, but no.
— (laughs)

19:31.420 --> 19:33.911
Mom dreams.
I used to have 'em as a kid,

19:33.964 --> 19:35.249
and now they're getting worse.

19:35.299 --> 19:37.255
— Wedding stress?
— I guess.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.132
But now right before I say, "I do,"

19:39.178 --> 19:41.544
Luke turns into my mother
and runs out of the church,

19:41.597 --> 19:43.007
and I can't catch her
because I can't find

19:43.057 --> 19:44.968
the handle on the door.

19:45.017 --> 19:48.134
My baby daddy punched my boyfriend
in the mouth and then moved out.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.142
Just sayin'.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.351
All right.
We really need a win today.

19:52.400 --> 19:54.356
Hey.

19:54.402 --> 19:56.438
Ooh. She's so busted.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.648
If she runs again,
l'm—a stop feeling sorry for her

19:58.698 --> 20:00.484
and her broke—ass car.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.364
Leigh.

20:02.410 --> 20:03.570
Excuse me?

20:03.619 --> 20:05.405
— Um...
— Uh, l'm Officer McNally.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.570
This is Officer Nash.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.488
Does Leigh Senett
live at this residence?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.078
Never heard of her.

20:11.127 --> 20:13.368
Oh. Well, her ID has this address on it.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.503
Then she needs to update her license.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.129
Well, maybe she lived here
before you did?

20:17.174 --> 20:19.039
I bought this house
from the bank.

20:19.093 --> 20:21.254
|——| don't——| don't know
who the owner was before that.

20:21.303 --> 20:22.713
— Oh.
— Okay. Thanks for your time.

20:22.763 --> 20:23.752
Thank you.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.515
(Andy) All right, new plan.
Let's check the addresses

20:27.560 --> 20:29.266
registered to her cell phone number.

20:29.311 --> 20:32.018
Okay, but if that doesn't work,
I'm playing Mrs. Claus.

20:34.608 --> 20:35.984
Marco Forlan.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.527
l'm Detective Barber.
What do you want?

20:37.570 --> 20:39.401
Oh, nice suit, Detective.

20:39.447 --> 20:41.358
ltalian wool, Pasolini cut.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.738
Okay, I'm bored of you already.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.320
Be nice.
I have information you want.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.701
Yeah, what I want right now
is a coffee.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.827
How about the address

20:48.873 --> 20:50.534
to a massive grow house
in the North End?

20:50.583 --> 20:54.542
(laughs to himself)
Let me guess.

20:54.587 --> 20:58.000
You give me the address,
and | talk to the prosecutor

20:58.048 --> 21:01.540
and tell him to go easy on you,
maybe keep you out of prison?

21:01.594 --> 21:04.381
Hmm. If I had a nickel...

21:05.473 --> 21:06.633
See what he's got.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.388
Let me know if it's worth my time.

21:08.434 --> 21:09.594
Yes, sir.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.559
(siren wails)

21:18.694 --> 21:20.150
(elevator bell dings)

21:21.197 --> 21:22.437
(knocks on door)

21:24.909 --> 21:26.399
Oh, there you are, baby.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.525
Nice cover.

21:29.872 --> 21:31.282
Well, it was either that

21:31.332 --> 21:32.572
or, "Where's my pizza?"

21:32.625 --> 21:33.865
But, you know,
these kinda give you away.

21:33.918 --> 21:36.250
Yeah. Where are the other guys?

21:36.295 --> 21:39.002
Uh, we got two UC guys
in the room across the hall.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.630
Spin Team's next to them.
All we gotta do

21:41.675 --> 21:43.836
is make sure Kadour goes in
and makes the deal.

21:43.886 --> 21:45.001
You should fire the maid.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.260
You're the neat one, remember?

21:46.305 --> 21:48.762
This is how I work.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.720
— How long until Kadour shows?
— About an hour.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.055
Uh, in the meantime,
our UC guys are playing

21:54.104 --> 21:56.846
a wicked game
of "Would you rather." (laughs)

21:56.899 --> 21:59.732
(UC officer, over wire) Oh, man. Um...

22:01.070 --> 22:03.686
I can't believe you volunteer us
for a 15—page search warrant.

22:03.739 --> 22:04.979
Quid pro quo.

22:05.032 --> 22:06.238
Speak English.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.944
Chances are grow house is a bust,

22:07.993 --> 22:09.369
but we fill out the boring papenNork,

22:09.411 --> 22:11.447
and Jerry lets us check it out,
and maybe,

22:11.497 --> 22:13.988
just maybe we get lucky,
find something there.

22:14.041 --> 22:16.373
Then I'm a lock
for the mounted unit training.

22:16.418 --> 22:18.670
I don't know, man.
My application's pretty solid.

22:18.712 --> 22:20.088
What, you applied, too?

22:20.130 --> 22:22.382
VVeH,yeah.
As soon as the posting went up.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.915
I didn't know you liked horses.

22:24.969 --> 22:27.836
Yeah, I like the idea
of being a horse cop.

22:27.888 --> 22:29.924
It's kinda like being a cowboy.

22:31.392 --> 22:32.882
(siren wailing)

22:35.396 --> 22:37.682
(dogs barking,
child shouts indistinctly)

22:37.731 --> 22:40.222
There is no way
that this is a grow house.

22:40.276 --> 22:42.437
That's what they want you to think.
Check the hydro meter.

22:42.486 --> 22:44.272
See if the numbers
are out of control.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.652
(scoffs) Okay. I read
this drug squad report

22:48.701 --> 22:50.908
that said some growers
install pressure plates

22:50.953 --> 22:52.409
around the meter,

22:52.454 --> 22:55.412
so as soon as you step
on the plates——click.

22:55.457 --> 22:57.664
It shuts off the excess power
to the meter so it looks normal.

22:57.710 --> 23:00.417
— Pressure plates, huh?
— Yeah.

23:00.462 --> 23:02.373
Seems normal.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.833
Have a look inside?

23:05.759 --> 23:08.136
Police! We have a warrant!

23:08.178 --> 23:09.338
Hello?

23:09.388 --> 23:10.377
We knocked, and nobody answered,

23:10.431 --> 23:11.546
so we picked the lock,

23:11.599 --> 23:14.011
which is perfectly
within our rights.

23:14.059 --> 23:15.674
Pretty sweet place.

23:15.728 --> 23:18.640
Yeah. Apparently, it's owned
by an LA music producer.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.806
He leased it out for a year,
maybe to the wrong people.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.349
Yeah, so where are they now?

23:23.402 --> 23:25.233
On a fertilizer run?

23:25.279 --> 23:27.440
I don't know, but let's search it
before they get back.

23:27.489 --> 23:30.026
All right.
But the first pot plant

23:30.075 --> 23:32.862
or even a watering can,
and we split, report back to Jerry.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.777
— (sniffs)
— (police radio chatter)

23:40.461 --> 23:42.417
(Andy) That plan sucked.

23:42.463 --> 23:44.795
(Traci) Of course her cell phone's
registered to a PO. box,

23:44.840 --> 23:48.332
'cause nothing can be easy today.

23:48.385 --> 23:49.500
Things are looking up.

23:53.891 --> 23:56.098
You take 10:00.
I'll take 2:00.

23:56.143 --> 23:57.883
— (engine sputtering)
— (Leigh) God.

23:59.563 --> 24:02.896
Oh, my God, please start.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.394
Ugh!

24:05.444 --> 24:08.732
(engine knocking, stops)

24:08.781 --> 24:11.989
Leigh Senett,
you're under arrest.

24:12.034 --> 24:15.572
You can come out,
or we can drag you out.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.501
What's gonna happen?

24:21.543 --> 24:22.794
Well, you're gonna spend
the night in lockup,

24:22.836 --> 24:24.167
and you can see a judge
in the morning.

24:24.213 --> 24:26.454
No, not to me, to my car.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.623
It goes to impound.

24:28.676 --> 24:32.009
Oh. But these things are all I have.

24:33.597 --> 24:35.007
You live in your car?

24:35.057 --> 24:36.297
(sighs)

24:36.350 --> 24:38.432
My whole world is here.

24:44.316 --> 24:46.898
This looks a little more promising.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.900
(police radio chatter)

24:48.946 --> 24:51.028
Hey, just——Hey,
just slow down, all right?

24:51.073 --> 24:54.361
Drug report also said that
some grow ops are booby—trapped.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.992
— Just gotta be careful.
— (switch clicks)

24:57.037 --> 24:59.574
It's not a drug den.
It's a basement reno.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.454
Damn.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.867
(sniffs)
Hey, do you smell that?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.167
Booyah.

25:14.388 --> 25:17.380
Dov, you know,
we should just call this in.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.094
Call what in?
That our snitch led us

25:19.143 --> 25:21.885
to a construction permit violation?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.474
No. First we see
if there's anything here.

25:24.523 --> 25:25.729
Then we talk to Jerry.

25:31.739 --> 25:33.400
(shotgun blast)

25:40.914 --> 25:42.245
You all right?

25:42.291 --> 25:43.701
Yeah, I'm fine.

25:43.751 --> 25:47.994
Dov, this isn't a grow op.
This is a meth lab.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.708
Yeah, we gotta get outta here now.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.006
— (click)
— (device beeps)

25:54.928 --> 25:55.917
Don't move.

26:06.106 --> 26:07.346
(Chris) Okay, listen.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.559
You're gonna be fine, okay?

26:08.609 --> 26:10.099
Bomb squad can be here
in ten minutes.

26:10.152 --> 26:11.437
They'll figure out
what you're standing on

26:11.487 --> 26:12.897
and disarm it, okay?
You're gonna be——

26:12.946 --> 26:14.026
No,no,no.
Don't——Don't touch the radio.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.438
What if the frequency sets it off?

26:15.491 --> 26:17.072
No, no, no. Listen,
you gotta stay still, okay?

26:17.117 --> 26:18.618
— You gotta let me call this in.
— We can figure out a way.

26:18.660 --> 26:19.820
We can disarm this thing ourselves.

26:19.870 --> 26:20.700
What are you——
What are you talking about?

26:20.746 --> 26:22.202
There's gotta be a shutoff switch.

26:22.247 --> 26:24.659
Okay, listen. I'm gonna go
look for a shutoff switch.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.495
Okay? Don't... move.

26:30.214 --> 26:31.579
We got this.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.498
We got this.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.881
Her warrants are all for money
owed to collection agencies

26:41.934 --> 26:43.765
and unpaid parking tickets.

26:43.811 --> 26:46.518
That's probably a given
when you're living out of your car.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.940
So what, her whole life goes
to impound, and that's that?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.057
Stand by.

26:54.404 --> 26:57.817
Jo's working a fraud case right now,
so she gave me a little primer.

26:58.617 --> 26:59.857
Going by Leigh's rap sheet,

26:59.910 --> 27:01.696
she hasn't committed
any criminal offenses.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.246
These are all committal warrants.

27:03.288 --> 27:05.324
So if she can come up
with the money...

27:05.374 --> 27:08.081
Then we can take her directly
to the court to pay it off,

27:08.127 --> 27:10.368
and then we can let her go.

27:10.420 --> 27:13.002
You're very sexy when
you're reading the fine print.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.413
Keep it in your pants, McNally.

27:14.466 --> 27:15.797
(both chuckle)

27:15.843 --> 27:18.585
If your daughter can bring
the $3,000 you owe,

27:18.637 --> 27:20.343
we can release YOU.

27:20.389 --> 27:21.595
I can't call her.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.097
Well, I know it's a lot of money,
but the alternative is jail time.

27:25.144 --> 27:27.260
She doesn't know I lost the house.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.052
She doesn't know
you're living in your car?

27:29.106 --> 27:31.267
Well, she lives eight hours away,

27:31.316 --> 27:34.934
and——and she has two children,
and she's very busy...

27:34.987 --> 27:38.445
and I don't want her to know.

27:38.490 --> 27:40.230
But she's your daughter.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.821
I mean, you need help.
You're in trouble.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.662
l——l was supposed
to pull myself together

27:47.708 --> 27:50.040
after her father died.

27:50.085 --> 27:53.168
Nicole made all the arrangements
for the funeral,

27:53.213 --> 27:55.295
but then she went home,

27:55.340 --> 27:59.379
and all I had to do was
find a way to live my life.

27:59.428 --> 28:03.512
So... every day,
I woke up, and I said,

28:03.557 --> 28:06.890
"Leigh, today is the day
you're gonna get things done."

28:06.935 --> 28:10.644
And I'd sit down,
and I'd make a list,

28:10.689 --> 28:13.897
but at the end of the day, l...

28:13.942 --> 28:16.604
l was just still sitting there,

28:16.653 --> 28:19.110
trying to figure out
how to get anything done.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.317
Why didn't you ask for help?

28:22.701 --> 28:24.487
I didn't know how.

28:24.536 --> 28:28.245
There were just too many things
on that damn list.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.156
Hmm.

28:37.549 --> 28:38.664
Nothing?

28:38.717 --> 28:41.003
I'm sorry, Dov.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.168
It's okay.

28:42.221 --> 28:43.427
I called for backup.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.588
(breathing hard)

28:45.641 --> 28:47.677
Okay, go wait outside.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.136
— If this thing goes off, |——
— No, man.

28:49.186 --> 28:50.642
— I'm not going anywhere.
— If this goes off,

28:50.687 --> 28:51.893
— I don't want you——
— No, I'm staying here.

28:51.939 --> 28:53.600
If I kill you, Gail's gonna kill me.

28:53.649 --> 28:56.186
Listen, if you keep moving,
she won't have to.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.311
(chuckles)
Tell her I'm sorry.

29:00.364 --> 29:02.480
(siren wailing in distance)

29:02.532 --> 29:05.490
You tell her yourself.
Backup's here.

29:11.333 --> 29:13.824
Then we wait for our guy
to buy the fake passports.

29:13.877 --> 29:15.458
Then, uh, we bust Kadour
with the money,

29:15.504 --> 29:17.415
and Bob's your uncle.

29:17.464 --> 29:18.829
How is Uncle Bob?

29:18.882 --> 29:21.123
Uh, he bought a bicycle
after his heart surgery.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.009
He's so slim now,
you wouldn't recognize him.

29:24.054 --> 29:25.339
Oh, good for him.

29:25.389 --> 29:27.095
Yeah, I mean, except
for the spandex shorts,

29:27.140 --> 29:28.516
but... (chuckles)

29:28.558 --> 29:30.139
That's a hard look
for anyone to pull off.

29:30.185 --> 29:32.517
Tell him I said hello.

29:32.562 --> 29:35.554
You could tell him yourself.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.983
I mean, just 'cause
we're not together

29:37.025 --> 29:38.936
doesn't mean
we can't be friends, right?

29:38.986 --> 29:40.567
I mean, we were friends first.

29:43.699 --> 29:45.655
Come on. It wasn't that bad,

29:45.701 --> 29:47.532
I mean, when we weren't fighting

29:47.577 --> 29:49.488
about whose career
was more important——

29:49.538 --> 29:51.529
Okay, you know what?
I never put my career

29:51.581 --> 29:52.957
ahead of you, not once.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.331
You wanted that promotion

29:54.376 --> 29:55.661
more than you wanted me.
It's that simple.

29:55.711 --> 29:57.076
The task force was
a once—in—a—lifetime gig.

29:57.129 --> 29:58.164
You wanted it, too.

29:58.213 --> 29:59.669
Yeah, and I decided to stay here

29:59.715 --> 30:01.706
because I thought we were
building a life together,

30:01.758 --> 30:04.340
and you got on a plane,
and you took the job.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.502
And I've regretted it ever since.

30:08.015 --> 30:08.970
(UC officer, over wire)
Mark's in play.

30:09.016 --> 30:11.382
We need eyes in the hallway.

30:11.435 --> 30:13.596
You take audio.
I got the hallway.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.226
(clatter)

30:16.690 --> 30:18.976
We are kicking ass today.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.857
Ten delinquents already
on their way to the clink.

30:20.902 --> 30:21.732
Ah.

30:21.778 --> 30:24.690
And only three people
spit on me today. (chuckles)

30:24.740 --> 30:27.197
That's 'cause you have excellent
customer service skills.

30:27.242 --> 30:28.448
— Mm—hmm.
— Thank you.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.700
Hey, come to shower us
with praise, boss?

30:30.746 --> 30:31.826
Shut it down.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.282
Frank?

30:33.332 --> 30:35.323
Diaz and Epstein,
they're in trouble.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.911
— What's going on?
— Peck, come with me.

30:40.505 --> 30:42.291
(ice rattling)

30:42.341 --> 30:44.002
(elevator bell dings)

30:57.606 --> 30:59.437
— (knock on door)
— Babe, open up.

30:59.483 --> 31:00.518
I left my key in there.

31:02.235 --> 31:04.487
— What took you so long?
— (chuckles)

31:04.529 --> 31:05.814
— Mm.
— Mm.

31:06.907 --> 31:08.192
(door beeps)

31:08.241 --> 31:09.401
Mm.

31:09.451 --> 31:12.158
(door closes)

31:12.204 --> 31:13.193
Mm.

31:14.373 --> 31:15.488
(lowered voice)
No weapons visible.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.412
(door beeps)

31:20.462 --> 31:22.077
Police! Down on the ground.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.961
Get down on the ground!

31:33.016 --> 31:34.517
Get up.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.969
Unh! Unh!

31:37.270 --> 31:40.307
I don't care if your tip leads
to the biggest bust of my career.

31:40.357 --> 31:41.642
If one of my guys gets hurt,

31:41.691 --> 31:43.227
I'm gonna kill you
with my own two hands.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.016
— What are you talking about?
— What am I talking about?

31:45.070 --> 31:47.186
The grow house, Marco,
there's no marijuana.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.605
— You know what's there, right?
— Wh——No.

31:49.658 --> 31:51.194
No? Meth lab.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.529
What? Unh!

31:55.789 --> 31:57.780
There's a meth lab
rigged with booby traps

31:57.833 --> 31:59.824
that's got one of my rookies
trapped on an LED.

31:59.876 --> 32:01.582
Hey. Hey, the guy
I get my dope from

32:01.628 --> 32:03.243
told me that's where
he gets it, okay?

32:03.296 --> 32:06.834
2255 Beaumont. Hey, he never
said anything about traps.

32:08.969 --> 32:10.709
If you know anything...

32:10.762 --> 32:12.969
(choking) Nnh.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.721
You better pray
nothing happens to my rookie,

32:15.767 --> 32:17.723
or you're going to prison
for the rest of your life.

32:17.769 --> 32:18.884
What? No.

32:18.937 --> 32:20.222
— You understand?
— No.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.228
No. I can't go to prison.

32:23.233 --> 32:25.315
Hey, I can't go to prison.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.975
Hey.

32:27.028 --> 32:29.610
Hey, you know what
they'll do to me there?!

32:31.199 --> 32:32.655
Ohh.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.067
(siren whoops)

32:38.248 --> 32:40.660
It's gonna be fine, Gail, okay?

32:44.754 --> 32:46.290
(Traci) What's going on?

32:46.339 --> 32:48.045
We don't know.
No one's telling us anything.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.467
(Andy) You okay?

32:49.509 --> 32:51.420
(Chris) Yeah, ljust——
I tried to stay with him.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.880
They wouldn't let me, and now——

32:52.929 --> 32:54.885
— It's okay.
— If anything happens to him...

32:54.931 --> 32:56.967
Nothing is gonna happen to him.

32:57.017 --> 32:59.008
Look, Dov's gonna be okay.

32:59.060 --> 33:01.312
Duke's got his best guy on it.

33:05.567 --> 33:07.432
(woman) How we doing, Dov?

33:10.197 --> 33:12.028
Been better.

33:12.073 --> 33:14.450
Yeah? Okay, my name is Sue.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.903
I'm gonna get you
out of here, okay?

33:15.952 --> 33:17.613
Okay.

33:17.662 --> 33:20.904
Now I want you to listen to me.
Don't move. Just listen.

33:20.957 --> 33:23.334
I'm gonna slide this sandbag
underyou.

33:23.376 --> 33:24.991
Once it's secure,
I'm gonna take your hand,

33:25.045 --> 33:28.754
and you're gonna step
towards me slowly. Got it?

33:28.798 --> 33:30.379
Yeah. (panting)

33:30.425 --> 33:31.540
Okay.

33:38.808 --> 33:42.426
And then you and me are
gonna grab a cup of coffee,

33:42.479 --> 33:44.720
and you're gonna tell me

33:44.773 --> 33:47.560
how a guy named Dov
ended up as a police officer.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.065
It's actually Hebrew for "bear."

33:49.110 --> 33:51.977
It's a really manly name.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.646
(chuckles) Well, you're still
gonna get me coffee.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.075
Okay.

33:56.117 --> 33:57.732
Ready?

33:57.786 --> 33:59.242
Yeah.

34:01.122 --> 34:04.364
So you're gonna take one step
and then another

34:04.417 --> 34:05.623
nice and slow.

34:05.669 --> 34:06.954
Just keep your eyes on me, okay?

34:07.003 --> 34:08.709
(panﬂng)

34:08.755 --> 34:10.165
There's no rush.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.625
We can stay here all night
until you're ready.

34:11.675 --> 34:13.211
Okay.

34:13.510 --> 34:14.420
Okay.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.222
(Sue whispers) It's okay.

34:21.268 --> 34:23.350
(floor creaking)

34:27.899 --> 34:31.187
Okay. One more step, Dov.
Piece of cake.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.936
In case I don't have another
chance to say this——

34:35.991 --> 34:37.071
Thank you.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.740
(creaking)

34:59.598 --> 35:01.054
(man on radio)
All units, move in.

35:01.099 --> 35:02.464
That's us, guys. Let's go.

35:02.517 --> 35:04.053
(man) Okay.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.058
Sam, what's happening?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.605
(man) Come on, guys.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.773
(radio chatter)

35:11.818 --> 35:14.605
(Po' Girl's "Take the Long Way" playing)

35:14.654 --> 35:15.689
(man) Everybody back up over here.

35:15.739 --> 35:17.479
I want this area clear.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.113
Clear here, totally clear.

35:19.159 --> 35:22.777
J‘ Let's take the long way J‘

35:22.829 --> 35:26.196
J‘ Watch the sunrise J‘

35:26.249 --> 35:29.332
J‘ Listen to the radio J‘

35:29.377 --> 35:32.665
J‘ All through the night J‘

35:32.714 --> 35:35.456
J‘ Take the long way J‘

35:35.508 --> 35:39.046
J‘ 'Cause I like the view J‘

35:39.095 --> 35:42.508
J‘ Go by the shoreline J‘

35:42.557 --> 35:47.267
J‘ Look at the moon J‘

35:51.191 --> 35:52.806
(water running)

35:52.859 --> 35:55.771
— You are such an idiot.
— Nice to see you, too.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.230
No, don't joke with me right now.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.315
Your venom is getting on my shoes.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.605
Don't be a jackass.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.364
I'm sorry.
Did somebody have a rough——

36:01.409 --> 36:02.444
You could've died!

36:02.494 --> 36:03.483
I almost did.

36:05.205 --> 36:07.446
I'm sorry.

36:07.499 --> 36:10.866
It's just after everything I did
to be seen as an equal,

36:10.919 --> 36:12.659
I'm back to being
the rookie screw—up.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.703
Dov, shut up.

36:14.756 --> 36:18.920
The only person who sees you
that way is you.

36:19.928 --> 36:20.963
(Chris) Give me two seconds.

36:21.012 --> 36:23.173
(locker clanks)

36:24.808 --> 36:27.220
I'll be in the parking lot.

36:27.268 --> 36:30.101
Okay. Cool.

36:30.146 --> 36:34.105
Hey. So Jerry thinks
the lab was a gang operation,

36:34.150 --> 36:36.812
making 100 pounds
of meth a month,

36:36.861 --> 36:37.850
and we helped take it down.

36:40.824 --> 36:43.657
So I've been thinking.
I'm gonna withdraw my application

36:43.702 --> 36:44.566
for the mounted unit training.

36:44.619 --> 36:46.325
What? Why?

36:46.371 --> 36:48.783
Well, we do the same job, man.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.572
We're gonna be competing
for things all the time.

36:50.625 --> 36:52.206
Just didn't seem worth it.

36:52.252 --> 36:53.992
If you want to apply, apply,
and we'll figure it out.

36:54.045 --> 36:57.708
Yeah, well,
I don't know, man. ljust...

36:58.967 --> 37:00.878
If it was something I really wanted,

37:00.927 --> 37:03.589
I wouldn't back down, you know?

37:03.638 --> 37:05.003
I hope you wouldn't either.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.557
All right, fine,
under one condition.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.888
From now on, we both
go for what we want.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.553
— All right.
— May the best man win.

37:13.606 --> 37:16.518
Yeah, may the best man win.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.354
(chuckles) I'm so glad
you're all right, man.

37:21.156 --> 37:22.612
Crazy kid.

37:28.204 --> 37:30.160
(buzzer sounds)
Hey, I'd make a great witness.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.788
I remember everything——
names, faces, dates.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.495
Hey. What are they
gonna do with him?

37:34.544 --> 37:36.660
They're keeping him in custody
till the drug squad's

37:36.713 --> 37:38.453
done their investigation,
but then who knows?

37:38.506 --> 37:39.962
— Hmm.
— (door release buzzes, beeps)

37:40.008 --> 37:41.669
Leigh Senett, please.

37:41.718 --> 37:43.458
— (man) Here you go.
— Thank you.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.934
Hey. I brought you some tea.

37:52.979 --> 37:54.059
Oh, thank you.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.437
You're welcome.

37:56.483 --> 37:59.099
Oh, I've been stuck so long,
afraid to move on,

37:59.152 --> 38:02.235
and now I'm in a jail cell.
It's kinda funny.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.565
Well, you don't
have to stay there.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.856
Oh, it's not that bad.
(chuckles)

38:05.909 --> 38:08.776
It's the closest thing I've had
to a bedroom in a long time.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.414
(sighs)

38:16.503 --> 38:18.459
I think you should call your daughter.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.168
You need her.

38:23.593 --> 38:25.254
Life is too short.

38:27.597 --> 38:29.508
Don't ever get stuck.

38:34.020 --> 38:36.102
(keying numbers)

38:39.943 --> 38:41.023
(inhales deeply)

38:41.069 --> 38:42.434
Nicki, honey?

38:42.487 --> 38:44.227
I'm sorry——
I'm sorry it's so late.

38:44.280 --> 38:48.273
ljust, um——| have
to tell you something.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.988
Um, no, everything's okay.

38:51.037 --> 38:54.780
Well, actually, no, it's not okay.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.414
Um, I think I need your help.

38:57.669 --> 38:59.751
(water running)

38:59.796 --> 39:01.582
Leigh called her daughter,

39:01.631 --> 39:03.838
finally checked something off her list.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.125
You know, it's funny.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.714
The minute you become a mother,

39:08.763 --> 39:12.255
you're suddenly expected to know
how to balance everything,

39:12.308 --> 39:17.428
how to be Ievelheaded
and nurturing, selfless.

39:17.480 --> 39:20.187
There's a lot of pressure to be perfect,

39:20.233 --> 39:22.770
and it's just something to think about.

39:23.987 --> 39:26.273
I never expected
my mom to be perfect,

39:26.322 --> 39:28.699
just expected her
to come back eventually.

39:28.741 --> 39:32.404
Well, maybe you invite her back,

39:32.453 --> 39:34.910
seize the day, reach out to her.

39:36.916 --> 39:38.781
Leigh lost everything.

39:38.835 --> 39:41.326
I know why she couldn't make that call.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.210
But my mom walked out of my life,

39:43.256 --> 39:46.123
and she made that decision, so...

39:47.969 --> 39:49.755
I have a family now.

39:49.804 --> 39:52.136
I've got you and my dad,

39:52.181 --> 39:53.796
Dov, Chris——

39:53.850 --> 39:56.341
and as much as I thought that
I would never say this——Gail.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.175
And Luke.

39:59.022 --> 40:00.853
Especially Luke.

40:00.899 --> 40:04.312
Oh, well, hello, Officer Williams.

40:05.570 --> 40:07.856
You look... wow.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.773
Good. Have a nice evening.

40:15.288 --> 40:16.994
— Jeez.
— Where is she going?

40:17.040 --> 40:18.405
I don't know.

40:18.458 --> 40:20.949
To six months of solid police work

40:21.002 --> 40:23.084
and a long sentence
with no parole. (laughs)

40:23.129 --> 40:24.244
Welcome back, Callaghan.

40:24.297 --> 40:26.037
(man) Yeah, welcome back.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.830
(man) Cheers.

40:29.677 --> 40:32.635
Mm. Let's take this party to Nelson.

40:32.680 --> 40:34.511
Uh, I'm gonna grab my stuff.
I'll meet you there.

40:34.557 --> 40:36.263
See ya.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.556
— (man) Are you gonna drive?
— (second man) Yeah, yeah.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.017
(door closes)

40:44.067 --> 40:45.557
You're not gonna join them?

40:46.986 --> 40:49.102
You broke my heart.

40:50.823 --> 40:52.484
(door release beeps)

40:53.493 --> 40:54.323
Hey.

40:55.078 --> 40:56.568
Hey.

40:56.621 --> 40:58.828
— (sighs) She's asleep.
— Thanks.

40:58.873 --> 41:00.784
You know, it's probably one of
the first good night's sleep

41:00.833 --> 41:03.700
she's had in a long time.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.414
Yeah, she said her daughter'd
be here in a few hours.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.624
She was hoping
you'd get to meet her.

41:07.674 --> 41:09.130
Oh, I'd love to...

41:10.426 --> 41:13.042
but I am running off of
four hours sleep, nine coffees,

41:13.096 --> 41:14.927
and I just really want to go
say hi to Luke

41:14.973 --> 41:16.053
and sleep till Wednesday.

41:16.099 --> 41:18.055
Okay, then have a good night.

41:18.101 --> 41:20.012
Yeah, you, too.

41:23.481 --> 41:27.144
(man)
J‘ Yesterday when I met you J‘

41:27.694 --> 41:30.436
J‘ You took my heart,
took my soul J‘

41:30.488 --> 41:33.070
J‘ Lost my mind, lost control J‘

41:33.116 --> 41:34.652
J‘ For all I know J‘

41:34.701 --> 41:38.614
J‘ I could be the best one J‘

41:38.663 --> 41:41.029
J‘ And you J‘

41:41.082 --> 41:43.573
J‘ You could take me there J‘
