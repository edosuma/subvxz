00:00.962 --> 00:02.150
Previously on Cedar Cove...

00:02.180 --> 00:03.566
Didn't Paul tell you? He's leaving.

00:03.596 --> 00:05.646
- I'm taking back my old job.
- I'm your daughter.

00:05.775 --> 00:07.641
I don't want to get married simple.

00:07.671 --> 00:09.429
I don't want to get married in a circus.

00:09.502 --> 00:11.221
The trial is over. It failed.

00:11.251 --> 00:12.509
Jack, Eddie is my nephew.

00:12.539 --> 00:14.147
I'm worried about us.

00:14.177 --> 00:15.602
I thought that you wanted this.

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:27.054 --> 00:28.524
Engaged?

00:28.554 --> 00:29.726
Yup.

00:29.756 --> 00:31.231
That was fast.

00:31.261 --> 00:32.284
Mm-hmm.

00:32.314 --> 00:34.257
It was too fast.

00:34.287 --> 00:36.463
For you or her?

00:37.634 --> 00:39.472
She's not thinking straight.

00:39.502 --> 00:40.592
She's in love.

00:40.622 --> 00:42.313
They were just broken up.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.104
Maybe they were just trying to figure out

00:44.134 --> 00:45.156
what mattered to them,

00:45.186 --> 00:46.662
and they found out it was each other.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.620
I don't want to see her get hurt.

00:49.650 --> 00:50.587
Hurt?

00:50.617 --> 00:51.792
Well, they're both so different.

00:51.822 --> 00:53.196
They're from two different worlds.

00:54.468 --> 00:57.443
Are you talking about you or Maryellen?

00:57.473 --> 00:58.646
What?

00:58.676 --> 01:00.769
Well, you and Cliff are very different.

01:00.799 --> 01:02.658
Yes, and look how that's been.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.331
We haven't exactly had
the easiest relationship,

01:05.361 --> 01:08.341
and now we can't even decide
what kind of wedding we want.

01:08.371 --> 01:09.478
From my memory,

01:09.508 --> 01:10.899
it was easy for you to be married to Dan

01:10.929 --> 01:12.520
because you had so much in common,

01:12.550 --> 01:14.861
but, ultimately, it wasn't enough.

01:14.891 --> 01:15.957
No.

01:16.116 --> 01:17.334
So, what am I supposed to do?

01:17.364 --> 01:19.861
For Maryellen, have faith.

01:20.930 --> 01:21.965
For you,

01:21.995 --> 01:24.137
it doesn't matter how you get married,

01:24.167 --> 01:25.391
what matters

01:25.421 --> 01:26.696
is that you love each other.

01:26.726 --> 01:29.036
Embrace your difference.

01:29.066 --> 01:32.161
It's what makes you
and Cliff you and Cliff.

01:32.191 --> 01:33.599
Yeah.

01:33.629 --> 01:35.170
Hello, ladies.

01:35.200 --> 01:37.343
Hello there, Mr. D.A.

01:37.373 --> 01:39.434
I haven't received your R.S.V.P.

01:39.464 --> 01:41.490
I'm not a big wedding guy.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.693
Yeah, well, you're coming.

01:42.723 --> 01:44.031
You've already got the suit.

01:44.061 --> 01:45.870
So I'll see you there.

01:47.091 --> 01:48.757
- Do I get a say in the matter?
- No!

01:48.787 --> 01:51.516
- Okay, thanks for clearing that up.
- You tell him, Gracie.

01:53.644 --> 01:54.646
Sit down.

01:58.541 --> 02:00.546
I talked to Anthony.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.723
I was hoping to get to you first.

02:03.753 --> 02:05.595
So it's true.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.102
It is.

02:08.132 --> 02:10.074
I'm leaving Cedar Cove.

02:23.649 --> 02:25.654
I wanted to tell you, I
just didn't have the chance.

02:25.684 --> 02:26.707
I know you.

02:26.737 --> 02:27.794
There's something you're not telling me.

02:27.824 --> 02:28.830
No.

02:28.860 --> 02:30.836
I deserve an explanation.

02:30.866 --> 02:32.006
I don't have one,

02:32.036 --> 02:33.511
other than the one I've already given you.

02:33.541 --> 02:36.353
Look, I gotta get to court.

02:36.383 --> 02:37.844
Um, you want to go for
a run a little later?

02:37.874 --> 02:39.746
- That sounds like fun.
- All right.

02:39.776 --> 02:41.367
As long as you tell me why you're leaving.

02:43.208 --> 02:44.093
Okay.

02:46.350 --> 02:47.602
How much push-back

02:47.632 --> 02:49.475
from the Montaulk community are we talking?

02:49.505 --> 02:50.561
Quite a bit.

02:50.591 --> 02:52.966
They managed to hold up development
on a planned strip mall

02:53.040 --> 02:54.991
- for the last six years and counting.
- Wow, tenacious.

02:55.021 --> 02:56.379
I am,

02:56.409 --> 02:58.252
and thank you very much.

02:58.282 --> 02:59.304
You'll also be pleased to know, Dad,

02:59.334 --> 03:01.261
that I'm accepting your offer,

03:01.291 --> 03:03.432
50-50, signatory power with Alex,

03:03.462 --> 03:04.905
on behalf of the company.

03:04.935 --> 03:06.944
How very conciliatory of you.

03:06.974 --> 03:08.833
That's the opposite of tenacious.

03:08.863 --> 03:11.005
I don't think he knows
what "tenacious" means.

03:11.035 --> 03:12.126
All that private school money

03:12.156 --> 03:13.296
down the drain. What a shame.

03:13.326 --> 03:14.767
Can we just focus, please?

03:14.797 --> 03:16.104
- Why did you change your mind?
- You going to change yours

03:16.134 --> 03:17.559
- Nope.
- All right.

03:17.589 --> 03:19.448
So, I figured we would
just move forward, then,

03:19.478 --> 03:20.735
and speaking of moving forward, Dad,

03:20.765 --> 03:21.988
when are you planning
on going to the Hamptons?

03:22.018 --> 03:23.542
I'm not.

03:23.572 --> 03:24.964
I'm sending my business
partner in my stead.

03:24.994 --> 03:26.753
What are you talking about, I'm your...

03:26.783 --> 03:28.057
I'm your business partner, Dad.

03:28.087 --> 03:30.397
No, you're my associate
at Saget Development.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.403
I'm talking about my
personal business partner.

03:32.433 --> 03:33.824
And who might that be?

03:33.854 --> 03:35.111
Hello.

03:35.141 --> 03:37.367
You've got to be kidding me.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.617
You're hard to find.

03:48.647 --> 03:50.623
Well, that's the idea.

03:54.419 --> 03:57.092
Brad and Jennifer are dropping
their request for damages.

03:57.122 --> 03:59.066
We're both going to take
care of our car repairs.

03:59.096 --> 04:00.737
Why?

04:00.767 --> 04:01.857
I called them and told them

04:01.887 --> 04:03.194
I changed my mind about settling,

04:03.224 --> 04:04.916
and they don't want to go
through the court system.

04:04.946 --> 04:06.504
Because they are lying.

04:06.534 --> 04:07.623
I know.

04:07.653 --> 04:08.844
Do you?

04:08.874 --> 04:10.299
Well, I do now.

04:10.329 --> 04:12.806
Otherwise, they wouldn't have
dropped their charges so fast.

04:12.836 --> 04:13.976
But my word wasn't good enough for you.

04:14.006 --> 04:15.949
You had to call their bluff to believe me.

04:15.979 --> 04:17.821
I know, I'm sorry.

04:17.851 --> 04:19.543
I let the past get in
the way of the present,

04:19.572 --> 04:20.880
and I shouldn't have.

04:22.804 --> 04:24.675
Okay.

04:24.705 --> 04:25.979
Thanks.

04:26.009 --> 04:28.736
And you stay as long as you want to.

04:28.766 --> 04:31.695
Well, with Jack here, it's
getting a little crowded.

04:31.725 --> 04:33.133
But I have so much space.

04:33.163 --> 04:34.671
I need more.

04:34.701 --> 04:36.861
I'm in your way in my own house?

04:37.882 --> 04:41.056
Yeah, a little.

04:47.911 --> 04:49.833
You want to re-up?

04:49.863 --> 04:51.003
I'm not breaking up with you.

04:51.033 --> 04:52.892
Deciding to re-enlist in the Navy

04:52.922 --> 04:54.346
without talking to me first

04:54.376 --> 04:57.355
sounds like a break-up
because it is a break-up.

04:57.385 --> 04:59.746
I was waiting for the
right time to tell you.

04:59.776 --> 05:01.034
Look, I've felt lost since I left the Navy.

05:01.064 --> 05:02.754
I didn't know that you
still felt like that.

05:02.784 --> 05:03.758
Well, I do.

05:03.788 --> 05:05.067
Look, Derek is great,

05:05.223 --> 05:06.364
but this isn't the kind of work

05:06.518 --> 05:08.684
that I thought I'd be doing
for the rest of my life,

05:08.878 --> 05:10.829
and now that I'm doing
better, I'm going to the base.

05:10.859 --> 05:12.200
I have a meeting.

05:12.230 --> 05:13.402
I can't believe that you want to leave,

05:13.432 --> 05:14.824
after everything that we have been through.

05:17.132 --> 05:19.020
I still love you.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.173
If you really loved me,

05:20.203 --> 05:21.928
then you would have discussed this with me

05:21.958 --> 05:23.683
before doing anything.

05:23.713 --> 05:25.021
This is a really big decision.

05:25.051 --> 05:26.241
- Look, Justine...
- No!

05:26.271 --> 05:28.699
You know what, now I need to be alone.

05:35.018 --> 05:36.388
Paul?

05:36.418 --> 05:39.062
Ms. Jennings.

05:39.092 --> 05:41.820
Shouldn't you be anywhere but here?

05:41.850 --> 05:43.125
I need you to lift my suspension.

05:43.155 --> 05:44.579
And why would I do that?

05:44.609 --> 05:46.752
Because I'm the hardest-working
A.D.A. you've ever had,

05:46.782 --> 05:47.756
and you need me.

05:47.786 --> 05:49.310
Thank you for your concern,

05:49.340 --> 05:51.516
but I have everything under control.

05:51.546 --> 05:52.821
Business as usual.

05:52.851 --> 05:54.024
Now, if you'll excuse me,

05:54.054 --> 05:56.448
I have to get these files to the clerk.

05:56.478 --> 05:58.119
If you lift my suspension,

05:58.149 --> 05:59.874
I can file them.

06:02.383 --> 06:03.468
Rebecca,

06:03.498 --> 06:05.810
you didn't show up for work,

06:05.840 --> 06:07.447
you didn't call,

06:07.477 --> 06:09.536
and you missed two filings.

06:09.566 --> 06:11.493
I'm sorry.

06:11.523 --> 06:12.996
And I have no reason to
believe that won't happen again.

06:13.026 --> 06:13.999
It won't.

06:14.029 --> 06:16.390
The law is a team sport,

06:16.420 --> 06:18.563
and you're so singularly
focused on your career

06:18.593 --> 06:20.686
at the expense of the work of this office.

06:20.716 --> 06:24.197
This isn't some stepping
stone to your next big move.

06:24.227 --> 06:25.952
What we do here,

06:25.982 --> 06:28.878
it affects people's lives.

06:28.908 --> 06:30.549
This isn't just about your career.

06:30.579 --> 06:31.552
I get that.

06:31.582 --> 06:32.890
I don't think that you do,

06:32.920 --> 06:34.194
and it's clear to me now

06:34.224 --> 06:36.650
that this time away hasn't
adjusted your attitude

06:36.680 --> 06:38.238
at all.

06:46.347 --> 06:48.318
I don't know where to start.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.032
Why didn't you tell us who you were?

06:53.062 --> 06:54.286
I didn't think you wanted to meet me.

06:54.316 --> 06:56.426
I came here to confront you both.

06:56.456 --> 06:58.047
But you didn't.

06:58.077 --> 06:59.568
I changed my mind.

06:59.598 --> 07:00.689
You stayed.

07:00.719 --> 07:03.313
I guess I wanted to know you,

07:03.343 --> 07:05.319
even if you didn't want to know me.

07:05.349 --> 07:07.459
But you had a fake I.D.?

07:07.489 --> 07:08.495
From some undercover work I did

07:08.525 --> 07:10.000
with the sheriff's department.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.006
You're an ex-cop, a private investigator.

07:12.036 --> 07:14.012
I'm a stranger in town.

07:14.042 --> 07:15.231
If you started getting curious,

07:15.261 --> 07:16.485
I just didn't want you to know

07:16.515 --> 07:18.508
that I was the daughter that you gave up.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.668
It was silly, and I never used it,

07:21.698 --> 07:23.707
but it was in my wallet
when Rebecca found it.

07:23.737 --> 07:26.098
I want you to know

07:26.128 --> 07:28.555
that I have thought
about you every single day

07:28.585 --> 07:30.276
since I gave birth to you.

07:30.306 --> 07:32.232
You're my first thought when I wake up

07:32.262 --> 07:34.238
and my last thought before I go to sleep.

07:34.268 --> 07:36.461
I thought about where you were,

07:36.491 --> 07:38.417
if you were happy,

07:38.447 --> 07:39.671
if you were loved.

07:39.701 --> 07:41.176
I was.

07:45.356 --> 07:48.497
I know that I don't have
any right to ask you this,

07:48.527 --> 07:50.587
but I hope

07:50.617 --> 07:52.291
that we can start over.

07:52.321 --> 07:54.215
I want you in my life.

07:54.245 --> 07:58.277
We want you in our lives.

08:01.621 --> 08:03.374
Does Linnette know...

08:03.404 --> 08:05.666
anything about me?

08:08.224 --> 08:09.376
Nothing?

08:16.582 --> 08:18.336
Who died?

08:18.366 --> 08:20.627
Luke wants to leave Cedar Cove.

08:20.657 --> 08:22.048
He wants to re-up.

08:22.078 --> 08:23.719
- The Navy?
- Yup.

08:23.749 --> 08:24.722
Wow.

08:24.752 --> 08:25.775
He wants to leave,

08:25.805 --> 08:27.063
so much so,

08:27.093 --> 08:28.616
that he would go back to
people trying to kill him.

08:28.646 --> 08:29.821
That's a message.

08:29.851 --> 08:30.824
No, it's not.

08:30.854 --> 08:33.298
He enlists and plans on staying together?

08:33.328 --> 08:34.217
Doubtful.

08:35.337 --> 08:37.592
I'm sure he'll come around.

08:37.623 --> 08:38.596
Yeah, maybe,

08:38.626 --> 08:39.765
when he's halfway across the world.

08:39.796 --> 08:41.606
Even if it's subconscious,

08:41.635 --> 08:42.909
it's still a move away from you,

08:42.940 --> 08:44.531
and to somewhere else.

08:50.633 --> 08:52.605
Look, I know you're going
through some things right now,

08:52.635 --> 08:55.447
but could you maybe not try to say out loud

08:55.477 --> 08:57.453
every thought that you have about things?

08:57.483 --> 08:58.706
Let's try that.

09:04.006 --> 09:05.593
So, once we get the
restaurant up and running,

09:05.623 --> 09:06.730
we can plan the wedding.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.770
Whatever you want.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.324
I want to elope.

09:10.354 --> 09:11.912
Really?

09:11.942 --> 09:13.032
I've been through all this with my mom,

09:13.062 --> 09:15.055
and I don't want the spectacle,

09:15.085 --> 09:17.629
I want to be your wife as soon as I can.

09:17.659 --> 09:20.110
- Your mother's never going to go for this.
- I'm a grown woman.

09:20.140 --> 09:21.524
It's my choice and my life.

09:21.554 --> 09:23.563
Okay.

09:24.902 --> 09:25.904
It's the bank...

09:25.934 --> 09:27.492
about the galley.

09:27.522 --> 09:28.712
Aw, thanks.

09:28.742 --> 09:30.417
Sorry.

09:30.447 --> 09:31.471
John speaking.

09:32.488 --> 09:33.510
I'm getting married.

09:36.854 --> 09:39.109
Do you really want to?

09:39.139 --> 09:41.868
Mom... yes.

09:41.898 --> 09:43.790
I thought he was going
to ask me a month ago,

09:43.820 --> 09:45.822
and then he didn't, and he left,

09:45.987 --> 09:47.310
and I've been miserable without him.

09:47.456 --> 09:48.955
I love you, and I love John,

09:48.985 --> 09:50.477
but I think this just might be

09:50.507 --> 09:52.566
too big a change for the both of you.

09:52.596 --> 09:54.489
Why don't you just wait,

09:54.519 --> 09:55.708
see how the restaurant does,

09:55.738 --> 09:58.167
and then you can start to
make plans for the wedding?

09:58.197 --> 09:59.505
Where is this coming from?

09:59.535 --> 10:00.673
I'm afraid.

10:00.703 --> 10:01.894
Of what?

10:01.924 --> 10:03.683
You being too impulsive.

10:03.713 --> 10:04.786
Impulsive?

10:04.936 --> 10:06.826
Honey, the two of you
were pretty much broken up

10:06.856 --> 10:08.079
and now you've just committed

10:08.109 --> 10:09.952
to spending the rest
of your lives together.

10:09.982 --> 10:10.955
We're in love.

10:10.985 --> 10:12.794
I just don't want to see you get hurt.

10:12.824 --> 10:14.765
I won't.

10:14.795 --> 10:15.969
I said that.

10:15.999 --> 10:17.106
I was wrong.

10:17.136 --> 10:19.312
I'm not you and John isn't Dad.

10:19.342 --> 10:20.566
I trust him.

10:20.596 --> 10:21.871
With your heart?

10:21.901 --> 10:23.826
All of it.

10:33.155 --> 10:34.775
Hey.

10:34.805 --> 10:36.280
I only have an hour for lunch.

10:36.310 --> 10:37.283
What's up?

10:37.313 --> 10:40.209
We have something we need to tell you.

10:40.239 --> 10:42.181
You're freaking me out.

10:42.211 --> 10:44.070
It's about Gloria.

10:44.100 --> 10:45.139
What did she do?

10:45.169 --> 10:46.392
It's not what she did.

10:46.422 --> 10:47.613
It's what we did.

10:47.643 --> 10:48.968
What did you do?

10:48.998 --> 10:52.495
Gloria is your sister.

10:53.666 --> 10:54.834
What?

10:54.864 --> 10:56.055
Before your father and I were married,

10:56.085 --> 10:57.343
I got pregnant,

10:57.373 --> 10:59.031
and I gave my daughter up

10:59.061 --> 11:00.319
for adoption.

11:00.349 --> 11:01.689
It's Gloria.

11:01.719 --> 11:03.193
She's your sister.

11:03.223 --> 11:04.948
It's why she came to Cedar Cove,

11:04.978 --> 11:06.420
it's why she moved across
the street from you,

11:06.450 --> 11:08.926
it's why she's been
trying to get to know you.

11:11.302 --> 11:12.888
I can't be here right now.

11:12.918 --> 11:14.360
Linnette...

11:14.390 --> 11:15.897
Let her go.

11:24.531 --> 11:25.918
Carry on.

11:26.406 --> 11:28.771
Luke, I know how much you want to be back,

11:28.932 --> 11:30.409
but after all you've been through,

11:30.439 --> 11:33.207
- I have to ask why?
- I want to serve my country.

11:33.237 --> 11:35.296
I miss it.

11:35.326 --> 11:39.193
You know, not the war but the
brotherhood, the feeling of purpose.

11:39.223 --> 11:41.350
I mean, honestly, I still
feel guilty for being here,

11:41.380 --> 11:42.389
for being alive,

11:42.419 --> 11:44.123
for not being over there with my buddies.

11:44.508 --> 11:46.211
I thought that would change,

11:46.241 --> 11:47.503
but it hasn't.

11:48.067 --> 11:50.221
You know, you're not the only young man

11:50.251 --> 11:52.629
to come back and say these things to me.

11:52.659 --> 11:55.438
Sometimes being a civilian
can be a hard transition.

11:55.468 --> 11:57.994
You've had some medical issues, son.

11:58.024 --> 11:59.332
That was in the past, sir.

11:59.362 --> 12:01.087
Unfortunately, what you're asking,

12:01.117 --> 12:02.501
to re-up, to go on active duty,

12:02.531 --> 12:04.882
will put you in situations
that could bring on episodes.

12:04.912 --> 12:06.303
I'm fine.

12:06.333 --> 12:09.061
Even if I wanted to, there
are hurdles in your way.

12:09.091 --> 12:12.654
It is difficult for a soldier
with severe PTSD to re-enlist.

12:12.684 --> 12:14.292
Son...

12:14.322 --> 12:15.998
in order to find a new purpose in life,

12:16.028 --> 12:18.339
you need to face whatever
it is that's challenging you

12:18.369 --> 12:20.178
and make peace with it.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.953
Thank you.

12:29.959 --> 12:33.133
I suppose you're here about Alex.

12:33.163 --> 12:34.750
What is it with her, Dad?

12:34.923 --> 12:37.607
Are you thinking she's
a candidate number four

12:37.637 --> 12:38.824
for wife, is that what you're thinking?

12:38.978 --> 12:40.379
Because if you are, trust me, Dad,

12:40.543 --> 12:41.751
you've got to keep looking,
she's not interested.

12:41.928 --> 12:45.419
Alex and I have a purely
professional relationship.

12:45.449 --> 12:46.890
So, what you're telling
me is you just decided

12:46.920 --> 12:48.762
to just ask a relative stranger
to be your business partner?

12:48.792 --> 12:50.067
Alex isn't a stranger.

12:50.097 --> 12:51.152
Dad, up until recently,

12:51.182 --> 12:52.825
she was paid to play with horses.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.246
You know what your problem is?

12:54.276 --> 12:56.252
You're always thinking inside the box.

12:56.282 --> 12:58.458
You look at Alex, you see a girl.

12:58.488 --> 13:01.550
When I look at Alex, I see
someone who is fearless.

13:01.580 --> 13:04.308
Her job was to tame
horses 10 times her size,

13:04.338 --> 13:05.980
and she did it without blinking.

13:06.010 --> 13:09.457
She has proven herself to
be someone I want on my team.

13:09.487 --> 13:11.413
What about me, Dad?

13:11.443 --> 13:13.051
Huh?

13:13.081 --> 13:13.971
What's it going to take for me to prove

13:14.001 --> 13:15.057
that I belong on your team?

13:18.067 --> 13:19.771
You can't answer that one, now, can you?

13:19.801 --> 13:21.075
And you want to know why?

13:21.105 --> 13:23.282
Because you can't see me.

13:23.312 --> 13:24.451
All you see is that little kid

13:24.481 --> 13:27.294
who you can set aside whenever you want.

13:27.324 --> 13:29.337
But you know what, Dad,
I'm not that kid anymore,

13:29.955 --> 13:32.609
and I'm getting sick and tired
of trying to convince you otherwise.

13:32.639 --> 13:34.693
- Well, before you storm out of here.
- I'm not storming anywhere.

13:34.723 --> 13:36.488
Let's remember what
brought me to Cedar Cove

13:36.518 --> 13:37.457
in the first place.

13:37.487 --> 13:38.543
And what is that?

13:38.573 --> 13:40.466
I believe it was... that's right,

13:40.496 --> 13:41.502
to bail you out of trouble with the feds.

13:41.532 --> 13:42.672
Gimme a break.

13:42.702 --> 13:44.678
So you can preach all you want

13:44.708 --> 13:46.350
about how I've wronged you,

13:46.380 --> 13:48.992
but your recent history
doesn't exactly give you

13:49.022 --> 13:50.864
the moral high ground, now, does it?

13:53.456 --> 13:54.591
Keep the change.

13:54.621 --> 13:56.381
The advice is free.

14:13.598 --> 14:15.938
I had one outstanding brief.

14:15.968 --> 14:17.359
I came in to finish it

14:17.389 --> 14:19.282
so it wouldn't fall through the cracks.

14:19.312 --> 14:21.121
As soon as it's done,
I'll be out of your hair.

14:21.151 --> 14:22.508
It's not a problem.

14:22.538 --> 14:24.347
I'm leaving Cedar Cove.

14:24.377 --> 14:25.383
I'm going back to New York,

14:25.413 --> 14:27.690
and Anthony is returning to his post.

14:27.720 --> 14:32.453
Okay.

14:32.483 --> 14:34.377
He doesn't seem to have
the same issues with you

14:34.407 --> 14:35.463
as I do,

14:35.493 --> 14:38.171
but until I officially leave,

14:38.201 --> 14:39.417
the suspension stands.

14:39.607 --> 14:40.762
Why are you leaving?

14:40.792 --> 14:42.901
Did you land a bigger job?

14:44.323 --> 14:45.693
No.

14:45.723 --> 14:48.201
I didn't take a job.

14:48.231 --> 14:50.959
It's just time for me to go.

14:57.529 --> 14:58.648
In your price range,

14:58.678 --> 15:00.204
there isn't a two-bedroom house for rent

15:00.234 --> 15:01.741
within a 15-mile radius.

15:01.771 --> 15:03.246
Did you call my mom's real estate agent?

15:03.276 --> 15:04.466
I did.

15:04.496 --> 15:06.170
She said the market is tight right now.

15:06.200 --> 15:07.675
Fine.

15:07.705 --> 15:09.263
I'm willing to go 20% higher,

15:09.293 --> 15:10.484
and you can start looking
at one-bedroom houses

15:10.514 --> 15:12.105
20 miles out of town.

15:12.135 --> 15:13.743
That bad, huh?

15:14.916 --> 15:16.669
Between Jack and Olivia's
new nesting arrangement,

15:16.699 --> 15:18.625
and Olivia's rules, I'm...

15:18.655 --> 15:21.382
I can't take it anymore.

15:21.412 --> 15:22.636
What rules are those?

15:22.666 --> 15:24.308
Pick up this, pick up that.

15:24.338 --> 15:25.612
Don't leave the milk open.

15:25.642 --> 15:27.652
And I have to start
wearing pants at all times.

15:27.682 --> 15:29.356
Those all sound pretty reasonable.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.214
I'm just saying.

15:34.507 --> 15:36.009
Maybe this market is a sign

15:36.039 --> 15:37.915
that it's time for me to leave Cedar Cove.

15:37.945 --> 15:39.436
No, I will find you something,

15:39.466 --> 15:40.907
just give me a little more time.

15:40.937 --> 15:43.365
Okay, but hurry.

15:43.395 --> 15:45.922
I need my freedom back.

15:58.461 --> 15:59.380
Hey, Paul!

15:59.410 --> 16:00.717
Hey.

16:00.747 --> 16:02.756
You gotta send me a pic
when you finish this thing.

16:02.786 --> 16:04.928
Why? Where are you going?

16:04.958 --> 16:07.152
I'm... I'm going home.

16:08.323 --> 16:09.610
I thought this was your home.

16:09.640 --> 16:10.613
I did, too,

16:10.643 --> 16:11.866
for a while.

16:11.896 --> 16:14.758
So, you're leaving?

16:14.788 --> 16:15.878
Yeah, it's time.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.851
I thought you liked it here.

16:17.881 --> 16:18.887
I do.

16:18.917 --> 16:21.445
And you and Peggy have been great.

16:21.475 --> 16:23.451
Well, Peggy has been great,

16:23.481 --> 16:25.657
but, eventually, you were great,

16:25.687 --> 16:27.664
and I'll pay you through the month.

16:27.694 --> 16:29.503
So, you don't want to tell
me why you're leaving, huh?

16:29.533 --> 16:31.140
Nothing to tell.

16:31.170 --> 16:33.898
Well, having nothing to
tell and not wanting to tell

16:33.928 --> 16:35.403
are two very different things.

16:35.433 --> 16:39.532
I think it was easier
when you didn't like me.

16:39.562 --> 16:41.755
Well, easier isn't always better,

16:41.785 --> 16:44.262
it's just easier.

16:46.052 --> 16:47.356
Yeah.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.081
I got your message.

16:56.111 --> 16:57.753
Let's get married.

16:57.783 --> 16:58.806
You keep saying that.

16:58.836 --> 17:00.427
Yeah, but let's do it.

17:00.457 --> 17:03.018
Let's get married in
a nice simple ceremony,

17:03.048 --> 17:04.489
like you want.

17:04.519 --> 17:07.782
This whole back and forth
between us, it isn't worth it.

17:07.813 --> 17:11.460
I can cancel the choir, and
the doves, and the venue.

17:11.490 --> 17:13.599
Let's just get married

17:13.630 --> 17:15.638
with our closet friends and relatives.

17:15.669 --> 17:16.642
Why?

17:16.672 --> 17:18.615
We're so different.

17:18.645 --> 17:19.986
Yes.

17:20.016 --> 17:22.326
And it's the difference that
makes this whole thing work.

17:22.356 --> 17:24.499
I've been trying to drag you into my world,

17:24.529 --> 17:26.806
and it's... it's not fair.

17:26.836 --> 17:28.226
Give and take?

17:28.256 --> 17:29.346
Yeah.

17:29.376 --> 17:31.519
Pretty nice way to start a marriage, huh?

17:31.549 --> 17:32.690
It is.

17:33.861 --> 17:37.036
- Are you sure?
- That I want a simple wedding?

17:37.066 --> 17:38.290
No.

17:38.320 --> 17:42.268
But I am sure that I
want us to find our "us."

17:42.298 --> 17:43.890
Come here.

17:46.565 --> 17:48.403
I'll take care of everything.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.295
I love you.

17:51.325 --> 17:53.803
I love you, too.

18:02.614 --> 18:04.752
Hey, handsome.

18:04.782 --> 18:05.755
Hey...

18:05.785 --> 18:07.794
What are you doing still awake?

18:08.656 --> 18:11.579
I missed you,

18:11.609 --> 18:13.920
so I waited up for you.

18:13.950 --> 18:16.394
Mm... it is nice to be missed.

18:18.685 --> 18:21.693
I think Grace's wedding

18:21.723 --> 18:23.088
could be a fun date night for us.

18:23.783 --> 18:26.616
Honey, right now,
I just can't promise anything.

18:27.543 --> 18:29.296
It's Grace's wedding.

18:29.326 --> 18:30.467
I know,

18:30.497 --> 18:33.725
- and I will try to be there.
- Try?

18:33.755 --> 18:34.785
Olivia...

18:34.962 --> 18:36.932
I don't want a roommate, I want a partner.

18:36.962 --> 18:40.477
Olivia, I am giving you
everything that I've got, okay?

18:40.507 --> 18:42.482
I am here right now with you.

18:42.512 --> 18:43.620
Isn't that enough?

18:45.158 --> 18:46.829
No.

18:47.542 --> 18:49.486
I think we both deserve more.

19:08.122 --> 19:10.120
Okay, two-bedroom on Connor Street.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.121
It's a tad above your budget,

19:12.151 --> 19:13.960
but, um, I think I can
get them to negotiate.

19:13.990 --> 19:16.400
It's so run-down.

19:16.430 --> 19:19.141
Okay, uh... this one's nice.

19:19.171 --> 19:20.311
It's only a one-bedroom.

19:20.341 --> 19:21.650
Will's only one person.

19:21.680 --> 19:22.953
What if he has a guest?

19:22.983 --> 19:25.126
They can sleep on the couch.

19:25.156 --> 19:26.784
I don't know, Will, it's kind of limiting.

19:26.983 --> 19:28.135
Yeah, I think Olivia is right.

19:28.165 --> 19:29.254
I think we should keep looking.

19:29.284 --> 19:30.659
Okay, I'll keep digging.

19:30.689 --> 19:32.230
Between this, school,

19:32.260 --> 19:33.901
and whatever is going on with Luke,

19:33.931 --> 19:35.775
I've got all the time in the world.

19:35.805 --> 19:36.827
Hmm, I remember being your age...

19:38.082 --> 19:39.536
so much free time.

19:40.790 --> 19:41.842
Right.

19:52.074 --> 19:54.999
I'm so glad you called.

19:55.029 --> 19:56.920
Did they tell you?

19:56.950 --> 20:00.063
That you're my sister?

20:00.093 --> 20:02.487
I am.

20:02.517 --> 20:04.242
You lied to me.

20:04.272 --> 20:06.834
I've been telling
everyone that you're okay,

20:06.864 --> 20:08.037
and to give you a chance,

20:08.067 --> 20:10.962
and you've just been
lying to me, to my face.

20:10.992 --> 20:13.745
I didn't know how to say the things
that I came here to say.

20:13.904 --> 20:15.936
And I thought your parents
didn't want anything to do with me,

20:16.044 --> 20:17.025
but they do.

20:17.055 --> 20:18.033
I was wrong.

20:18.063 --> 20:19.321
So was I.

20:19.351 --> 20:21.243
Linnette...

20:21.273 --> 20:22.997
we're family.

20:23.027 --> 20:24.553
We're sisters.

20:24.583 --> 20:26.342
I just wanted to meet you.

20:26.372 --> 20:28.147
Family doesn't lie to each other.

20:28.177 --> 20:30.320
I just called to tell you to your face,

20:30.350 --> 20:33.112
stay away from me.

20:33.142 --> 20:35.703
I want nothing to do with you.

20:41.705 --> 20:45.983
So, you can't go back to the Navy.

20:46.013 --> 20:47.989
I knew it'd be a long shot.

20:48.019 --> 20:50.413
I got a couple buddies who have tried.

20:50.443 --> 20:51.968
Man, you've done your service.

20:51.998 --> 20:54.675
Yeah, I know.

20:54.705 --> 20:56.430
You don't know this about me,

20:56.460 --> 20:57.936
I used to play football in high school.

20:57.966 --> 20:58.939
Quarterback.

20:58.969 --> 21:00.360
Oh, yeah?

21:00.390 --> 21:01.363
Yeah.

21:01.393 --> 21:02.449
I got scouted,

21:02.479 --> 21:04.120
got a full ride, headed off to college.

21:04.150 --> 21:06.310
It was everything I'd ever
dreamed of since I was five.

21:06.340 --> 21:08.383
- What happened?
- My first season,

21:08.413 --> 21:10.790
I got hit by a 300-pound linebacker,

21:10.820 --> 21:13.147
bent my knee 90 degrees
the other direction.

21:13.177 --> 21:14.485
I spent the next year

21:14.515 --> 21:17.493
in and out of operating rooms, rehab,

21:17.523 --> 21:19.416
lost my scholarship,

21:19.446 --> 21:20.669
couldn't play anymore.

21:20.699 --> 21:22.509
So, what did you do?

21:22.539 --> 21:23.979
I buried the past where it belongs,

21:24.009 --> 21:25.400
in the past.

21:25.430 --> 21:26.855
I hooked up with a friend of my father's,

21:26.885 --> 21:28.192
and I took all that hard work

21:28.222 --> 21:29.446
and passion I had for football

21:29.476 --> 21:31.117
and I put it into this.

21:31.147 --> 21:32.165
When I started,

21:32.195 --> 21:33.559
I was the youngest captain out here.

21:33.735 --> 21:35.328
Some of the guys still
give me the business.

21:36.216 --> 21:37.385
Wow.

21:37.415 --> 21:39.175
It's not the Navy or anything,

21:39.205 --> 21:41.565
but I know what it's like
to give up on a dream,

21:41.595 --> 21:43.654
and I'm proof that you can
come out the other side better.

21:43.684 --> 21:47.583
Different, but better.

21:47.613 --> 21:49.723
Got it.

21:49.753 --> 21:53.150
I don't think this is
as much about the Navy

21:53.180 --> 21:55.272
as it is about Justine.

22:03.297 --> 22:05.269
I wouldn't be able

22:05.299 --> 22:06.974
to do the infrastructure series justice.

22:07.004 --> 22:08.813
I have two other field
pieces I'm working on.

22:08.843 --> 22:11.320
I don't have time for a third.

22:11.350 --> 22:12.741
Eddie reminded me

22:12.771 --> 22:14.329
that the paper has a
lot of resources invested

22:14.359 --> 22:15.884
in those pieces of his.

22:15.914 --> 22:17.505
Jack, you seem very passionate about it.

22:17.535 --> 22:19.595
You could handle it.

22:19.625 --> 22:22.236
I'd love to.

22:22.266 --> 22:23.657
I love the field, I love this story,

22:23.687 --> 22:25.696
I know it'll have a national audience.

22:25.726 --> 22:27.669
So it's settled, Jack
will write the series?

22:27.699 --> 22:29.625
- Yes.
- Great.

22:29.655 --> 22:30.711
And of course,

22:30.741 --> 22:33.385
Eddie will run the day-to-day
of the paper while I'm gone.

22:33.415 --> 22:35.726
You are my second, after all.

22:42.581 --> 22:45.924
Okay, what's wrong?

22:45.954 --> 22:47.929
What?

22:47.959 --> 22:50.236
I put that cookie in front
of you an hour ago,

22:50.266 --> 22:51.273
and it's still there.

22:51.303 --> 22:52.192
Oh.

22:53.363 --> 22:55.535
Well, Paul is going back to New York.

22:56.202 --> 22:58.638
Okay, I know why I'm upset,

22:59.012 --> 23:01.233
but you spent most of your time
trying to get him to go.

23:01.263 --> 23:03.693
I was just watching out for Jack.

23:03.723 --> 23:05.648
And now?

23:05.678 --> 23:07.571
I like him, okay?

23:07.601 --> 23:09.744
I always liked him.

23:09.774 --> 23:11.666
It was hard to not like him,

23:11.696 --> 23:14.007
and now that everything is
okay with Jack and Olivia,

23:14.037 --> 23:17.567
and I'm free to not-not like him,

23:17.597 --> 23:19.657
he's leaving.

23:19.687 --> 23:23.502
If he wants to leave, we can't stop him.

23:25.508 --> 23:27.763
You see...

23:27.793 --> 23:30.522
I don't think he wants to leave.

23:30.552 --> 23:32.027
I think he likes it here.

23:34.703 --> 23:37.140
- Can I get some extra whipped cream?
- In a minute.

23:37.170 --> 23:38.036
Thanks!

23:41.088 --> 23:42.575
What did you do with Rebecca?

23:42.605 --> 23:44.246
You are clearly a clone.

23:44.276 --> 23:46.487
Very sweet, but not the real deal.

23:46.517 --> 23:48.861
Paul is leaving.

23:48.891 --> 23:50.449
And you're taking his job?

23:50.479 --> 23:52.455
No. Not yet, anyway.

23:52.485 --> 23:53.508
But it definitely means

23:53.538 --> 23:55.965
I won't be on suspension for much longer.

23:55.995 --> 23:57.804
Why is that?

23:57.834 --> 23:59.023
Because Anthony is a pushover,

23:59.053 --> 24:01.230
and I'll just go back
to doing whatever I want.

24:01.260 --> 24:02.868
Doesn't sound like
Anthony's a very good boss.

24:02.898 --> 24:04.289
Well, I don't need a leader.

24:04.319 --> 24:07.165
I do better when I'm in charge.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.886
Whipped cream.

24:08.916 --> 24:09.839
Thanks.

24:09.869 --> 24:10.892
You're the best.

24:10.922 --> 24:11.812
Don't I know it.

24:13.317 --> 24:15.841
Well, Paul is clearly a very good teacher.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.863
I was suspended.

24:17.893 --> 24:19.201
How do you call that being a good teacher?

24:19.231 --> 24:20.539
Because he was trying to teach you

24:20.569 --> 24:21.791
how to work well with others.

24:21.821 --> 24:23.631
I'm not in Third Grade.

24:23.661 --> 24:25.886
I don't need Paul schooling
me on how to be a lawyer.

24:25.916 --> 24:28.027
Being advised can be super helpful.

24:28.057 --> 24:31.872
I could use a little guidance
myself right about now.

24:31.902 --> 24:33.042
Luke hasn't called?

24:34.631 --> 24:35.967
He will.

24:37.673 --> 24:39.595
I obviously wasn't making him very happy.

24:39.625 --> 24:40.514
Maybe.

24:42.821 --> 24:46.030
Maybe... it'll work out.

24:46.060 --> 24:47.335
How bad is this Luke thing

24:47.365 --> 24:48.955
if you are trying to cheer me up?

24:50.879 --> 24:51.931
I need cake.

24:51.961 --> 24:52.978
Stat.

24:53.337 --> 24:55.141
- It's a medical term.
- It's Latin.

24:55.171 --> 24:56.311
Short for "statim."

24:56.341 --> 24:58.150
Latin for "immediately."

24:58.180 --> 24:59.871
They say Latin is a dead language,

24:59.901 --> 25:01.164
but actually...

25:01.194 --> 25:02.880
You guys don't care.

25:02.910 --> 25:03.910
I care about cake.

25:07.679 --> 25:08.814
So, are you going to

25:08.844 --> 25:10.186
tell me what's wrong?

25:10.216 --> 25:12.693
You don't want to know.

25:12.723 --> 25:15.033
I do.

25:18.762 --> 25:20.382
Gloria, our neighbor?

25:20.412 --> 25:21.971
Yeah?

25:22.001 --> 25:24.662
She's my sister.

25:28.491 --> 25:30.580
Perfect. Let's talk later.

25:34.258 --> 25:35.343
The Smith brief,

25:35.373 --> 25:36.848
and I have to warn you,

25:36.878 --> 25:39.239
it's anything but brief.

25:39.269 --> 25:41.863
Your leaving is the talk of the courthouse.

25:41.893 --> 25:43.284
Well, good news travels fast.

25:43.314 --> 25:45.290
No.

25:45.320 --> 25:46.293
Everyone loves you.

25:46.323 --> 25:47.881
We're all going to miss you.

25:47.911 --> 25:49.385
Thank you.

25:49.415 --> 25:50.807
Why is that?

25:50.837 --> 25:52.060
Why are we going to miss you?

25:52.090 --> 25:54.534
I'm fun and likable.

25:54.564 --> 25:56.540
No, I mean, why are you leaving?

25:56.570 --> 25:58.161
I can tell you don't want to leave.

25:58.191 --> 25:59.131
I do.

25:59.161 --> 26:00.167
No, really,

26:00.197 --> 26:02.006
I can see it in your eyes.

26:02.036 --> 26:03.344
You know, and I know you.

26:03.374 --> 26:05.161
You don't want to leave.

26:05.936 --> 26:07.991
I want you.

26:09.162 --> 26:10.281
I have to leave,

26:10.311 --> 26:14.209
because I have feelings for you
that go beyond the scope of the job.

26:14.239 --> 26:16.265
Okay?

26:16.295 --> 26:17.603
Happy?

26:17.633 --> 26:18.974
I'm not.

26:25.775 --> 26:27.225
You once said, uh,

26:27.255 --> 26:30.850
that love was worth fighting for,

26:30.880 --> 26:32.188
and you're right,

26:32.218 --> 26:33.358
and I know that you're right,

26:33.388 --> 26:34.912
and I would stay,

26:34.942 --> 26:38.172
but I can't blow up your world.

26:38.202 --> 26:40.879
Not now that you finally have it on track.

26:40.909 --> 26:42.635
Paul...

26:42.665 --> 26:44.558
You have Jack,

26:44.588 --> 26:46.146
and I don't want to cause any trouble,

26:46.176 --> 26:49.321
but I can't just stand
by and not do anything.

26:49.351 --> 26:52.247
I can't pretend that
I'm not falling for you.

27:01.158 --> 27:02.160
Thank you.

27:02.190 --> 27:03.448
For what?

27:03.478 --> 27:04.885
For opening me up again.

27:07.343 --> 27:09.548
I wasn't even sure if
my heart worked anymore.

27:12.391 --> 27:14.313
But it does.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.990
And it...

27:18.020 --> 27:20.080
breaks...

27:21.669 --> 27:24.058
every day I can't be with you.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.193
You know what I'm going to miss most?

27:30.223 --> 27:32.199
What?

27:32.229 --> 27:34.088
I'm going to miss our friendship the most.

27:34.118 --> 27:36.178
You're a great friend.

27:36.208 --> 27:37.599
And that's all I'll ever be.

27:39.221 --> 27:41.728
Which is why I have to go.

27:41.758 --> 27:43.734
Because I can't stand by

27:43.764 --> 27:46.124
and watch you be with someone else.

27:54.734 --> 27:57.191
So, did Mom tell you the news?

27:57.221 --> 27:59.280
Yes, you and John are buying the Galley.

27:59.310 --> 28:00.618
That's perfect.

28:00.648 --> 28:02.873
John and I are getting married.

28:02.903 --> 28:05.181
Oh, honey.

28:05.211 --> 28:07.303
Grace! How could you not tell me?

28:07.333 --> 28:08.500
Mom thinks it's a mistake.

28:08.530 --> 28:10.315
I just think the two of
them need to slow down.

28:10.454 --> 28:11.818
John and I know what we want.

28:11.848 --> 28:14.302
- I'm just saying that what's the hurry?
- Mom is taking a leap of faith,

28:14.332 --> 28:16.547
I don't see why she can't
support me doing the same.

28:16.577 --> 28:18.169
I have a lot more experience than you have,

28:18.199 --> 28:19.841
and I don't want to see you get hurt.

28:19.871 --> 28:21.178
I'm not going to get hurt.

28:21.208 --> 28:22.766
That's how I felt when I was your age,

28:22.796 --> 28:23.903
and I did get hurt,

28:23.933 --> 28:25.193
and I married the wrong man.

28:25.223 --> 28:27.664
Now, I'm not going to stand
by, watch you make a mistake,

28:27.836 --> 28:29.754
- and not say something.
- You won't have to.

28:29.784 --> 28:31.710
- What's that supposed to mean?
- We're eloping.

28:40.453 --> 28:41.522
David called.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.247
He wants me to write the
infrastructure series.

28:44.277 --> 28:45.501
Yeah, I know.

28:45.531 --> 28:48.008
This is totally not cool.

28:48.038 --> 28:49.011
No.

28:49.041 --> 28:51.569
You know what's "not cool"?

28:51.599 --> 28:53.775
Your attitude towards me,

28:53.805 --> 28:55.697
towards the paper, towards this job,

28:55.727 --> 28:56.951
even towards journalism.

28:56.981 --> 28:59.626
You see me as competition.

28:59.656 --> 29:02.552
I see you as a privileged,
over-educated kid

29:02.582 --> 29:03.638
with a whole lot of attitude,

29:03.668 --> 29:05.811
and no skill to back up that attitude.

29:05.841 --> 29:07.617
That's what I see.

29:09.625 --> 29:12.297
Look, do you want to get some skill?

29:12.327 --> 29:13.333
Do you want to learn?

29:13.363 --> 29:14.754
Do you want to get better?

29:14.784 --> 29:17.930
Do you want my job someday?

29:17.960 --> 29:20.655
Then that all begins now,

29:20.685 --> 29:22.193
right here,

29:22.223 --> 29:25.419
with you first losing that attitude,

29:25.449 --> 29:27.174
rolling up your sleeves,

29:27.204 --> 29:30.518
and getting to work at getting
some real life experience.

29:30.548 --> 29:31.839
So, you're trying to help me?

29:33.947 --> 29:35.901
You know, I was you.

29:35.931 --> 29:37.071
I was.

29:37.101 --> 29:38.960
Actually, I think I was worse than you.

29:38.990 --> 29:41.919
But my first editor, he
took me under his wing,

29:41.949 --> 29:43.089
and he showed me

29:43.119 --> 29:46.482
how to back up that bravado and attitude

29:46.512 --> 29:49.274
with real skill,

29:49.304 --> 29:51.698
and, you know, a funny thing happened.

29:51.728 --> 29:53.920
The more skill I acquired,

29:53.950 --> 29:55.960
the less bravado I needed.

29:57.215 --> 29:58.852
You wouldn't be doing this

29:58.882 --> 30:00.473
if my uncle didn't own the paper.

30:00.503 --> 30:02.781
Maybe not,

30:02.811 --> 30:04.737
but I am doing it.

30:04.767 --> 30:09.133
So, the question is,

30:09.163 --> 30:11.506
what are you going to do about it?

30:16.355 --> 30:18.945
So, the key is to present
our case as a given

30:18.975 --> 30:21.503
so the focus is on
negotiation not permission.

30:23.306 --> 30:25.598
You know this has nothing
to do with you, right, Alex?

30:25.628 --> 30:27.604
He's using you to get to me.

30:27.634 --> 30:28.858
I'm good at what I do.

30:28.888 --> 30:29.894
Yeah, well, I'm better,

30:29.924 --> 30:31.147
and he knows it.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.619
We're in the middle of a
meeting, if you don't mind.

30:32.649 --> 30:33.739
No, I do mind, actually, Dad.

30:33.769 --> 30:35.662
I mind very much.

30:37.050 --> 30:38.253
You win.

30:38.283 --> 30:40.142
Okay? I'm done.

30:40.172 --> 30:41.228
You want control of Saget,

30:41.258 --> 30:42.315
you want Alex running your investments,

30:42.345 --> 30:43.903
you want to live in Cedar Cove?

30:43.933 --> 30:44.906
Swell.

30:44.936 --> 30:45.992
But do me a favor.

30:46.022 --> 30:48.499
You do your thing,
and I'll do mine.

30:52.848 --> 30:54.134
So, as I was saying,

30:54.164 --> 30:56.891
we can't let the community
think that they're in control.

30:56.921 --> 30:58.613
You know, one day, you two
are going to go too far,

30:58.643 --> 31:00.652
and he's not going to come back.

31:00.682 --> 31:01.655
You'll regret it.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.754
Luke wants to re-enlist.

31:06.784 --> 31:08.342
He can't.

31:08.372 --> 31:09.813
He wants to,

31:09.843 --> 31:11.100
and he didn't tell me

31:11.130 --> 31:13.357
before he went and talked
to Vice Admiral Nelson.

31:13.387 --> 31:15.196
Okay...

31:15.226 --> 31:17.369
I don't know what to do.

31:17.399 --> 31:20.428
Do I push for the relationship,

31:20.458 --> 31:22.935
or do I just let him go without a fight?

31:22.965 --> 31:24.223
Do you think he wants to leave?

31:24.253 --> 31:25.777
He tried to re-enlist, Mom.

31:25.807 --> 31:27.232
Do you love him?

31:27.262 --> 31:29.071
I do.

31:29.101 --> 31:30.206
That's the easy part.

31:30.236 --> 31:32.414
Relationships take work and commitment,

31:32.444 --> 31:35.724
but if you think he's the one,
you already know what to do.

31:35.754 --> 31:37.062
The question is,

31:37.092 --> 31:38.648
is he the one?

31:43.949 --> 31:44.951
Hi

31:44.981 --> 31:46.456
Hi.

31:46.486 --> 31:48.428
I'm done hounding you.

31:48.458 --> 31:50.100
I'm just here to meet Anthony.

31:50.130 --> 31:51.303
Well, good luck with that.

31:51.333 --> 31:53.225
I know you'll get what you want.

31:55.032 --> 31:57.322
I'm sorry if I was a pain.

31:57.352 --> 31:59.076
Who, you?

31:59.106 --> 32:00.163
No!

32:00.193 --> 32:02.002
You, you're a joy to work with.

32:02.032 --> 32:03.339
Ha-ha.

32:03.369 --> 32:04.977
Seriously,

32:05.007 --> 32:09.022
I'm sorry that I wasn't
more of a willing student.

32:09.052 --> 32:10.861
I should have listened to you more,

32:10.891 --> 32:13.252
because you're really good at your job.

32:13.282 --> 32:14.957
Oh.

32:14.987 --> 32:16.210
Well, thank you.

32:17.382 --> 32:18.434
You're a good attorney,

32:18.464 --> 32:19.709
Ms. Jennings.

32:20.773 --> 32:23.027
I just hope that someday,
you'll learn to ask for help

32:23.057 --> 32:25.774
because then I'll know our
time together wasn't wasted.

32:27.396 --> 32:28.532
It wasn't.

32:31.390 --> 32:33.061
Wasted...

32:50.563 --> 32:52.485
- Mom, can I borrow these?
- Yes, of course.

32:52.515 --> 32:54.156
Get the clutch to go with it, but hurry.

32:54.186 --> 32:55.160
Why?

32:55.190 --> 32:56.464
Grace wanted to get ready over here,

32:56.494 --> 32:58.670
and she and Maryellen
want to come downstairs.

32:58.700 --> 33:01.345
And she doesn't want us
to see her in her dress.

33:01.375 --> 33:02.541
Got it.

33:03.102 --> 33:04.408
So, still no rental?

33:04.609 --> 33:06.249
- Really?
- I found you many places.

33:06.425 --> 33:09.369
You just didn't think any of
them lived up to mom's standards.

33:09.399 --> 33:11.508
Will, I told you, there is
no pressure to leave.

33:11.538 --> 33:13.598
Hey, guys, what about my place?

33:13.628 --> 33:15.052
I mean, it's just sitting there,

33:15.082 --> 33:16.473
fully furnished, empty.

33:16.503 --> 33:17.648
Jack, that is a great idea.

33:17.802 --> 33:20.284
It's amazing. Are you sure
you want to rent it out?

33:20.314 --> 33:21.537
Yeah, why wouldn't I?

33:21.567 --> 33:22.792
Well, what if you need it?

33:22.822 --> 33:24.079
Why would I need it?

33:24.109 --> 33:25.082
I live here.

33:25.112 --> 33:26.971
True, but just what if...

33:28.092 --> 33:29.261
What if... what?

33:29.291 --> 33:30.816
You're right.

33:30.846 --> 33:32.320
It's a great idea.

33:32.350 --> 33:33.691
It's a great idea.

33:33.721 --> 33:34.945
Okay then, we've got a deal.

33:34.975 --> 33:37.335
- Thank you so much, Jack.
- Yeah, you bet.

33:37.365 --> 33:40.344
Now I just hope Grace is okay
with me being Justine's plus-one.

33:40.374 --> 33:41.431
Grace has enough to worry about.

33:41.461 --> 33:43.721
She is not thinking about you.

33:43.751 --> 33:45.309
And we're going to be late.

33:47.284 --> 33:48.535
Really?

34:01.324 --> 34:02.576
For you.

34:02.606 --> 34:04.666
A gift.

34:06.707 --> 34:07.709
Really?

34:07.739 --> 34:09.347
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

34:09.377 --> 34:11.268
Thanks, Bob.

34:11.299 --> 34:13.693
Aw, we're going to miss you.

34:15.867 --> 34:17.902
A lot of people around here
are going to miss you.

34:18.418 --> 34:20.463
Do you really have to go
right after the wedding?

34:20.493 --> 34:21.751
I do.

34:22.888 --> 34:24.257
Let's go, huh?

34:24.288 --> 34:25.703
I've got a bride to give away.

34:25.931 --> 34:27.034
Yes, you do.

34:28.485 --> 34:29.607
Thank you.

34:42.844 --> 34:45.268
All right, it's all steamed.

34:46.406 --> 34:48.025
You okay?

34:49.866 --> 34:51.168
Nervous.

34:51.199 --> 34:52.873
Aw, don't be.

34:52.904 --> 34:54.178
It's just so hard.

34:54.208 --> 34:55.215
You make it hard.

34:55.245 --> 34:56.368
Ever since Daddy,

34:56.398 --> 34:58.585
you've built this shell around yourself,
for protection.

34:59.578 --> 35:00.672
But Cliff,

35:00.883 --> 35:02.821
he broke through.

35:02.851 --> 35:04.910
Trust your heart and take that leap.

35:04.940 --> 35:07.133
How did you get to be so wise?

35:07.163 --> 35:09.172
I'm your daughter.

35:09.202 --> 35:10.309
Yes.

35:10.339 --> 35:11.396
And you cannot elope.

35:11.426 --> 35:12.424
- Mom...
- No...

35:12.454 --> 35:15.408
You cannot elope, because
you cannot deny me the joy

35:15.438 --> 35:16.863
of planning your wedding.

35:16.893 --> 35:18.116
I don't want a big ceremony.

35:18.146 --> 35:19.453
I know.

35:19.483 --> 35:21.259
But I do want you there.

35:21.289 --> 35:23.131
I know.

35:23.161 --> 35:24.468
I love you.

35:24.498 --> 35:26.943
I love you, too.

35:26.973 --> 35:29.065
- Aw, Mama...
- Oh, honey.

35:35.431 --> 35:36.513
Moon.

35:38.348 --> 35:39.917
- He was, like, smelling it.
- Warren.

35:41.571 --> 35:43.191
Oh. Dad.

35:43.221 --> 35:45.414
How'd you score your ticket?

35:45.444 --> 35:47.002
I know Cliff through Alex.

35:47.032 --> 35:48.121
How about you?

35:48.151 --> 35:49.174
Well, I'm crashing.

35:49.204 --> 35:50.805
Or I lost my invite in the mail.

35:50.835 --> 35:52.719
- One of the two.
- Good boy.

35:52.749 --> 35:55.193
Never take "no" for an answer.

35:55.223 --> 35:56.312
That goes for us as well.

35:56.342 --> 35:58.236
You're a Saget, not a quitter.

35:58.266 --> 35:59.739
My job is to push you.
You know that, right?

35:59.769 --> 36:01.327
Yeah, Dad, I know, but, unfortunately,

36:01.357 --> 36:02.749
sometimes, you push me a little too far.

36:02.779 --> 36:04.671
Maybe. I never said I was perfect.

36:04.701 --> 36:06.426
No, I'll give you that,
you're definitely not perfect.

36:06.456 --> 36:07.883
Well, you keep trying to best me,

36:08.063 --> 36:09.184
one day, you will.

36:09.214 --> 36:12.110
- You think?
- Not really.

36:12.140 --> 36:13.581
- I hate you.
- I know.

36:14.621 --> 36:17.384
That's the sweetest I've ever
seen you two be with each other.

36:17.414 --> 36:18.944
Oh, my God, Alex, come
on, pull yourself together.

36:18.974 --> 36:20.100
It's a wedding, not a funeral.

36:20.130 --> 36:21.805
Do you want a drink?

36:21.835 --> 36:23.560
No, thank you. Have a seat.

36:25.702 --> 36:27.562
Honey...

36:27.592 --> 36:28.602
Let us explain.

36:33.759 --> 36:35.146
I told Gloria...

36:35.176 --> 36:36.181
You talked to her?

36:36.211 --> 36:37.317
Yeah.

36:37.347 --> 36:39.358
I told her family doesn't lie to family.

36:39.388 --> 36:41.164
Please forgive us.

36:41.194 --> 36:43.870
I don't think I can.

36:54.069 --> 36:56.074
Hey, there.

36:56.104 --> 36:57.829
I didn't think you were coming.

36:57.859 --> 36:59.417
I felt like I needed to be here.

36:59.447 --> 37:01.306
Well, don't.

37:01.336 --> 37:04.098
Don't feel like you have to be here.

37:04.128 --> 37:05.769
Don't feel obligated to be here,

37:05.799 --> 37:07.859
or obligated to be with me.

37:07.889 --> 37:11.704
It's not a duty, it's a relationship.

37:12.842 --> 37:13.960
I know.

37:17.222 --> 37:19.928
I want you to be with me
because you want to be.

37:19.958 --> 37:21.784
It's not a matter of
wanting to be with you,

37:21.814 --> 37:23.322
I love you.

37:23.352 --> 37:26.548
I just don't know if I can be
the man that you want me to be,

37:26.578 --> 37:27.718
and the man that you deserve.

37:38.535 --> 37:40.373
Hey.

37:42.297 --> 37:43.514
Hi.

37:43.544 --> 37:45.511
Seems we keep running into each other, huh?

37:45.697 --> 37:47.193
We do.

37:53.964 --> 37:54.832
Hi.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.444
Thank you, Bob.

38:15.474 --> 38:16.981
Just so we're clear,

38:17.011 --> 38:20.409
I am not giving you away,

38:20.439 --> 38:22.498
just loaning you out.

38:28.984 --> 38:32.076
Cliff did it.

38:32.106 --> 38:34.083
But he didn't want anything splashy.

38:34.113 --> 38:36.875
He wanted you to be happy.

38:36.905 --> 38:38.763
Oh, I love him.

38:38.793 --> 38:42.190
Well, it's a good that
you're marrying him then.

39:18.966 --> 39:23.329
Welcome, friends and family.

39:23.359 --> 39:25.268
We are gathered here today

39:25.298 --> 39:27.324
to witness and celebrate

39:27.354 --> 39:29.196
the marriage of Cliff and Grace.

40:18.896 --> 40:20.649
I am overjoyed

40:20.679 --> 40:22.353
to introduce you

40:22.383 --> 40:24.779
to Mr. and Mrs. Harting.

41:04.680 --> 41:05.983
Penny for your thoughts.

41:06.871 --> 41:08.240
Paul.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.028
Before I leave,

41:10.058 --> 41:13.459
and I am leaving...

41:15.295 --> 41:17.346
I have to know.

41:19.726 --> 41:22.138
Do you feel the same way about me?
