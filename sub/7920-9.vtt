00:02.536 --> 00:04.136
REPORTER: A record heat wave
is melting Los Angeles,

00:04.138 --> 00:07.006
sparking chaos in stores
across the Southland.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.540
Riot police have been summoned
to several locations... Oh, damn.

00:08.542 --> 00:09.975
This heat is untenable.

00:09.977 --> 00:12.044
It's like a Jewfro
apocalypse in here.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.380
I look like a '70s
divorce attorney.

00:14.382 --> 00:16.715
NICK:
So we don't have A/C.

00:18.452 --> 00:20.052
You guys are going
to love this.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.321
I invented something
even better.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.723
It's called the Ranch System.

00:24.725 --> 00:26.392
The Ranch System for Cooling.

00:26.394 --> 00:28.193
This is one of my
best inventions.

00:28.195 --> 00:29.828
Reagan's going to freak
out when she sees it.

00:29.830 --> 00:32.698
Check it out. We've got
a combination of cool winds,

00:32.700 --> 00:34.700
a-a cool, chilly pond,

00:34.702 --> 00:36.068
you wear white jeans
'cause they don't absorb heat--

00:36.070 --> 00:38.370
that's actually science,
I did research.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.165
You know, science aside, man,
you working those jeans.

00:40.191 --> 00:41.240
Oh, thanks for saying that, man.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.374
I was insecure
about the way they looked.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.242
You killing it, man.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.843
Hey, guys.
How are you doing?

00:44.845 --> 00:46.845
Well, everything here
looks normal.

00:46.847 --> 00:48.347
Welcome to The Ranch.

00:48.349 --> 00:49.348
I don't know what that means.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.582
Have a seat.

00:50.584 --> 00:51.884
REAGAN:
Why would I do that?

00:51.886 --> 00:53.018
NICK: It'll cool you
right off. You'll love it.

00:53.020 --> 00:55.521
Ooh. Is that chair
supposed to be wet?

00:55.523 --> 00:56.755
It is.
I...

00:56.757 --> 00:58.123
Okay.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.728
And away we... cool!

01:02.730 --> 01:04.563
(laughing):
Check it out!

01:04.565 --> 01:05.764
Feels like somebody is learning

01:05.766 --> 01:07.199
to whistle
very close to my face.

01:07.201 --> 01:08.200
That's right, it does.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.435
She said it feels like

01:09.437 --> 01:10.769
someone's whistling
close to her face!

01:10.771 --> 01:12.071
I never thought
of that.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.238
It's another plus.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.373
No.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.607
No, it's not.

01:15.609 --> 01:16.875
But I have a better idea.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.778
Why don't we
all cool off...

01:19.780 --> 01:21.413
with the brand-new air
conditioner that I bought?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.082
Son of a...  Yes! What? What?

01:23.084 --> 01:24.716
A/C!
Oh...

01:24.718 --> 01:27.219
damn. CECE: Oh, it was so hot.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.455
Oh, yeah, this is wet.
CECE: Having A/C.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.290
That's sweat from my bottom.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.158
♪ ♪

01:35.129 --> 01:36.895
SCHMIDT:
This is amazing.

01:36.897 --> 01:38.597
Thank you, Reagan.
Finally, we can stop living

01:38.599 --> 01:40.132
like people in
a beer commercial

01:40.134 --> 01:42.634
before the beer shows up.
How did you pull this off?

01:42.636 --> 01:44.803
It's not a big deal. That whole
riot thing's really overblown.

01:44.805 --> 01:47.473
Get the hell back!
(screams)

01:47.475 --> 01:49.942
I will be putting the A/C in my
room and everyone is welcome.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.143
No, thank you. We're good.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.411
I speak for all of us.

01:52.413 --> 01:53.979
REAGAN: Okay.

01:53.981 --> 01:54.980
Well, we are
observing gym rules,

01:54.982 --> 01:56.081
so make sure you wipe down

01:56.083 --> 01:57.182
anything you plan to sit on.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.819
Whatever.

02:00.821 --> 02:02.254
More breeze for us.

02:02.256 --> 02:03.455
I'm gonna grab
some old underpants

02:03.457 --> 02:04.990
and I'll put a pair

02:04.992 --> 02:06.492
in the freezer for each of you.

02:06.494 --> 02:07.926
Trust me,
I'm wearing

02:07.928 --> 02:09.161
frozen underwear right now,

02:09.163 --> 02:10.996
and I feel amazing.
(crackling)

02:10.998 --> 02:13.632
So, I'm in good shape.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.134
Cece?
Mmm.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.169
I think maybe you should go...
go hang out by the A/C.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.605
Cece's got a big audition today
to be a reporter.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.673
She's been taking
broadcasting classes.

02:21.675 --> 02:23.342
Any way you slice it,

02:23.344 --> 02:26.278
that cafeteria pizza
is a great deal.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.513
You know, in fact,

02:27.515 --> 02:28.780
I'm getting a little
hungry myself.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.082
How about you, Carl?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.018
I thought
the next thing

02:33.020 --> 02:34.286
I was supposed
to talk about

02:34.288 --> 02:36.121
was the rain.

02:36.123 --> 02:37.356
It is, Carl.

02:37.358 --> 02:39.491
I was just having
a little banter.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.160
Oh.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.828
Um...

02:42.830 --> 02:45.197
I... uh, I had
a sandwich

02:45.199 --> 02:47.132
so... I'm full.

02:47.134 --> 02:48.634
The audition's just for

02:48.636 --> 02:50.002
gas station TV, okay?

02:50.004 --> 02:51.370
Nobody watches it.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.671
WINSTON: Don't you
dare downplay it.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.373
I adore gas station
television,

02:54.375 --> 02:56.008
I mean, myself,
personally.

02:56.010 --> 02:58.143
It is the intersection
between information

02:58.145 --> 02:59.711
and also gas.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.346
That's right.
Cece, today it's gas,

03:01.348 --> 03:02.681
tomorrow, it's local news--

03:02.683 --> 03:04.550
the next thing you know,
you're reporting

03:04.552 --> 03:05.884
diabetes statistics

03:05.886 --> 03:07.319
as we all watch B-roll

03:07.321 --> 03:08.720
of fat people walking
across the street.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.355
I just, I don't...

03:10.357 --> 03:11.890
I-I don't think
I'm gonna go to the audition.

03:11.892 --> 03:13.058
'Cause it's...

03:13.060 --> 03:14.359
it's just so hot.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.628
You know?

03:17.565 --> 03:18.897
Okay.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.566
Um...

03:20.568 --> 03:22.034
Yeah, I mean,
that's-that's cool.

03:22.036 --> 03:24.236
Just... Look, I love you
no matter what.

03:24.238 --> 03:25.737
Go cool off.

03:25.739 --> 03:27.673
All right.
All right.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.708
Can I talk to you
for a second?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.877
What the hell was
all that coddling?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.679
Whoa. What are you, a
big-bosomed grandma?

03:33.681 --> 03:35.047
Tough love!
Make her go!

03:35.049 --> 03:36.081
Don't tell me what to do!

03:36.083 --> 03:37.216
I'm her fiancé,

03:37.218 --> 03:38.417
not some schnook off the street

03:38.419 --> 03:39.851
eating a peanut butter cookie.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.087
It's my job to give her
love and support.

03:42.089 --> 03:44.256
That's how I get her
to go to the audition.

03:44.258 --> 03:47.259
As a cop, do you think I would
get anyone to do anything

03:47.261 --> 03:48.727
if I were being
kind and supportive?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.362
Hell no!

03:50.364 --> 03:52.264
Look, I have recently
found my cop voice

03:52.266 --> 03:54.600
and I'll tell you this:
it is very effective.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.435
Is that what you've been
practicing in the bathroom?

03:56.437 --> 03:57.536
(loud):
Everybody stop!

03:57.538 --> 03:59.438
Make a left turn!

03:59.440 --> 04:02.441
(high, wavering): You have the
right to remain silent! You...

04:02.443 --> 04:03.942
(elegant):
Freeze! Nah.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.444
(over-enunciating):
Three hundred

04:05.446 --> 04:08.280
and three thousand
thelonious thistles...

My point is this, man.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.429
You can't hug and kiss Cece
into doing anything.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.231
Your mind would melt if you knew

04:26.233 --> 04:27.799
what I've hugged
and kissed Cece into doing.

04:27.801 --> 04:29.201
Stay out of it, Winston.

04:32.273 --> 04:34.606
(chuckles):
My guys.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.141
Hey, who needs
Reagan's A/C, right?

04:36.143 --> 04:37.976
Here.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.445
Put some of my old underwear
on your face. It feels great.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.747
Oh, Nick...

04:41.749 --> 04:43.148
you're gonna make a great dad.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.816
I'll see you later.

04:44.818 --> 04:46.118
Okay.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.486
Hey! Who needs him, huh?

04:47.488 --> 04:49.087
Yeah.
We got each other.

04:49.089 --> 04:50.155
Yeah.  We've been
through worse.

04:50.157 --> 04:51.156
Chicago!
Chicago!

04:52.459 --> 04:53.792
City of soup, you know?

04:53.794 --> 04:54.826
Yes, sir.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.128
So I'm gonna go
take a shower.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.429
I'll be back
in a hot minute.

04:57.431 --> 05:00.232
Or, as we say
on a day like today...

05:02.169 --> 05:04.670
...a minute.
(laughs) That's great, man.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.805
That's chill, that's chill. That's great.
Thanks for taking my back today.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.173
I'll see you in a sec.
All right, all right.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.208
You and me, all day. You and me.
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

05:11.845 --> 05:14.179
Look who it is!
What happened?

05:14.181 --> 05:17.015
The A/C fall over
and squish Winston's cat?

05:17.017 --> 05:19.117
Oh, my God, please don't tell me
that happened. I would die.

05:19.119 --> 05:20.619
I just came out here to tell you

05:20.621 --> 05:21.853
that it's actually
really nice in there.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.021
It's really nice right here,

05:23.023 --> 05:24.356
with my underpants on my face.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.024
I think maybe
you should stop pouting

05:26.026 --> 05:28.660
because I didn't like
whatever this is.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.196
Wait, what?

05:31.198 --> 05:33.865
Why would I care if you,
specifically, didn't like it?

05:33.867 --> 05:36.535
Nick.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.303
Reagan.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.005
Nick, come on.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.373
You want to go there?

05:41.375 --> 05:43.108
I want to go where?

05:45.045 --> 05:47.646
What are you talking about?

05:47.648 --> 05:49.214
You wanted to impress me

05:49.216 --> 05:51.116
because you have a crush on me.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.319
(laughs)

05:54.321 --> 05:56.388
It's nice to get a good laugh
in this heat.

05:56.390 --> 05:58.056
(laughing)

05:58.058 --> 05:59.524
I need a laugh.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.226
It's too hot not to laugh.

06:01.228 --> 06:02.494
Lord knows it!

06:02.496 --> 06:04.396
You do.
(laughing)

06:04.398 --> 06:06.732
I don't have a crush on you.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.233
You're very conceited.

06:08.235 --> 06:10.168
And I don't mean to burst
your bubble here, missy,

06:10.170 --> 06:13.171
but I am not out here

06:13.173 --> 06:16.408
because of my
"so-called crush on you,

06:16.410 --> 06:17.843
"based on my actions

06:17.845 --> 06:19.745
that led you to believe
I have a crush on you."

06:19.747 --> 06:20.912
I am out here

06:20.914 --> 06:22.581
because I have never been

06:22.583 --> 06:25.250
more comfortable
in my entire life.

06:25.252 --> 06:27.219
Okay, you know what?
Just go get!

06:27.221 --> 06:29.221
Winston and I
don't need you, sister.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.689
REAGAN: Oh, you mean
Winston, like, this Winston?

06:30.691 --> 06:33.325
What do you mean, like this...

06:35.362 --> 06:36.428
Oh, Winston.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.597
I'm really sorry.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.532
It's fine, it's fine.
Who needs you?

06:40.534 --> 06:42.200
'Cause the hottest part
of the day is already over.

06:42.202 --> 06:43.268
It's 9:30 in the morning.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.403
Then tell me this:

06:44.405 --> 06:45.837
why did I just eat lunch?

06:47.074 --> 06:48.340
Why did I just eat lunch?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.279
(chuckling): Another guy
just collapsed out there.

06:54.281 --> 06:55.714
Oh!

06:55.716 --> 06:58.183
But the Good Samaritan
to the rescue!

06:58.185 --> 07:01.286
(thudding) Oh, damn. Good
Samaritan just collapsed.

07:01.288 --> 07:03.054
Oh!

07:03.056 --> 07:06.525
And UPS guy to the rescue!

07:06.527 --> 07:09.294
(thudding)
And the UPS guy just collapsed.

07:09.296 --> 07:13.365
Ah, lady stealing packages...

07:13.367 --> 07:15.467
Ah...

07:15.469 --> 07:17.969
(thudding)
Oh! And the lady just collapsed.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.639
Whoo. You know, I'm actually
kind of getting chilly in here.

07:20.641 --> 07:22.140
Look, guys.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.875
I got this box of Jess's
weird old ski clothes.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.544
Oh!
Ooh...

07:26.713 --> 07:27.979
Hello, 1989.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.047
WINSTON:
Check me out,

I'm in Gstaad.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.088
Gstaad's all about après-ski.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.423
Well, it's nice
in the summer, too.

Wh... I... What does it matter?
Just tell the truth.

Have you been there?
Have you been there?

07:48.435 --> 07:49.835
I'm sorry, have you?
No, I haven't been there.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.570
Well... (laughs) Should
I be ashamed of that,

07:51.572 --> 07:53.004
or can we all
just tell the truth

07:53.006 --> 07:54.840
about whether
we've been to... "Shtaad."

07:54.842 --> 07:56.775
Please. It's "Gstaad."

07:56.777 --> 07:58.076
Shaad.
Shtaad.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.644
No one in this room
has been to Gstaad.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.480
Yeah, one more fan.

08:01.482 --> 08:02.914
Just a little closer.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.683
Okay, that'll do it.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.518
You guys are suckers in
there! This is great!

08:06.520 --> 08:08.286
Should we be
worried about him?

08:08.288 --> 08:10.288
Worried about Nick? Oh, no,
this is just what he does.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.123
Okay, but being exposed
to the heat for that long

08:12.125 --> 08:13.525
is actually super-dangerous,

08:13.527 --> 08:16.361
so... maybe I should go
reason with him.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.609
It's not even hot in reality.

08:30.611 --> 08:32.477
You're obviously suffering
from heat exhaustion.

Vermont November.

15:45.612 --> 15:46.911
Fine, let's just say
you are right.

15:46.913 --> 15:48.579
Then at least
let me do it, okay?

15:48.581 --> 15:50.915
You don't have to do that.

15:50.917 --> 15:53.251
I want to do it.

15:53.253 --> 15:57.088
I mean, I don't, like,<i> want </i>
to do it, obviously, but...

15:57.090 --> 15:58.756
(stammers)
What if I'm wrong?

15:58.758 --> 16:00.792
If you think this is right,
it's probably right.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.428
You've been, you've been right
about a lot of stuff today.

16:03.430 --> 16:05.663
Like what?
What else was I right about?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.432
Just a lot of stuff. I don't
want to talk about what

16:07.434 --> 16:09.267
you were actually right about
at this moment. Okay, ready?

16:09.269 --> 16:11.102
Uh...
If I get burned up

16:11.104 --> 16:12.770
and die this way,
it would be

16:12.772 --> 16:14.138
such an embarrassing
way to go.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.107
But what would be
nice about it is

16:16.109 --> 16:17.141
that I would technically
have been right.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.810
Here we go.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.445
Heroes don't wear capes.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.280
No, no, no...

16:22.282 --> 16:24.349
(whirring)

16:25.785 --> 16:27.852
Those sons of bitches did it.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.288
(chuckling)

16:30.290 --> 16:31.956
Hey, great!

16:31.958 --> 16:34.692
Really good.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.761
That was really great.

16:43.803 --> 16:45.670
(whispers):
What are you looking at?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.538
Huge... rat.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.648
(squeaking)
(screaming)

16:57.650 --> 16:59.517
(screaming)
No! No! No!

16:59.519 --> 17:01.552
This is my nightmare!

17:05.825 --> 17:08.493
(people shouting indistinctly)

17:08.495 --> 17:11.396
It's time.

17:15.835 --> 17:17.368
(groans)

17:17.370 --> 17:19.737
(grunting)

17:19.739 --> 17:21.372
How did I...?

17:21.374 --> 17:23.541
Did you carry me out
like a firefighter?

17:23.543 --> 17:25.410
No, you woke up right away.

17:25.412 --> 17:26.878
And then you were like,
"Ooh, I need some fresh air."

17:26.880 --> 17:28.513
So we came outside,
I bought you a muffin

17:28.515 --> 17:29.714
and then you passed out again.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.716
Oh, yeah, I remember
that muffin.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.184
I feel like you had
a pretty bad shock,

17:33.186 --> 17:35.486
so let's ask
a few questions.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.422
What day of the week is it?

17:37.424 --> 17:39.590
That's not something
I typically know.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.726
I would guess Monday.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.894
Okay.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.262
Blackout.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.897
ATM's are down.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.765
Cash is king

17:47.767 --> 17:49.834
and batteries is queen.

17:49.836 --> 17:52.503
What? Stop being
so whimsical, Winston.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.940
Cece still hasn't
called me back.

17:55.942 --> 17:57.408
(sighs)

17:57.410 --> 17:58.943
I think I pushed her
too far.

17:58.945 --> 18:01.512
No, Schmidt,
you did the right thing, man.

18:01.514 --> 18:03.047
Look, people get mad
at police officers

18:03.049 --> 18:05.450
because we tell them
what they don't want to hear.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.251
Yet, everyone loves

18:07.253 --> 18:09.087
police officer...
(horns honking)

18:09.089 --> 18:10.788
(deep voice):
Hey, it's a blackout,

18:10.790 --> 18:11.889
not the Rapture!

18:11.891 --> 18:12.890
You yield!

18:12.892 --> 18:14.125
All right!

18:14.127 --> 18:15.726
(people shouting)
Hey, hey, hey, sir, sir!

18:15.728 --> 18:17.295
Keep it moving! Keep it moving!
Keep it moving!

18:17.297 --> 18:19.063
Come on,
right this way, ma'am.

18:19.065 --> 18:21.032
Right this way, ma'am.
Right this way, ma'am.

18:21.034 --> 18:23.201
Right that way, ma'am.
Sir, go, go, go!

18:23.203 --> 18:24.235
We ain't got all day!

18:24.237 --> 18:25.436
WINSTON:
Sir!

18:25.438 --> 18:27.605
Cece. Right this way, ma'am.
Right that way, ma'am.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.107
Thank God you're here.

18:29.109 --> 18:31.242
Look... I'm-I'm sorry.

18:31.244 --> 18:32.810
Yeah, well, you should be.
You really pissed me off.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.313
I wrote something rude
on your car.

18:35.315 --> 18:36.714
It was that stupid cop voice.

18:36.716 --> 18:37.915
I shouldn't have
pushed you that hard.

18:37.917 --> 18:39.217
No, you should've.

18:39.219 --> 18:40.818
'Cause you were right.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.554
I was chickening out.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.890
So I went.
You did?

18:45.892 --> 18:47.592
Mm-hmm. Well, that's amazing.
How did it go?

18:47.594 --> 18:49.327
Real bad. Yeah.
It went real bad?

18:49.329 --> 18:50.995
Okay, well, you know what?
about it, baby, I'm sure...

18:50.997 --> 18:52.997
No, no, no, no.
They just didn't...

18:52.999 --> 18:54.632
It was, it was
legitimately terrible

18:54.634 --> 18:58.436
but not because
I'm not talented.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.271
I went to the bar first

19:00.273 --> 19:02.140
so I was wasted
and wearing shorts,

19:02.142 --> 19:04.942
which I won't do next time.

19:04.944 --> 19:06.310
(both laugh)

19:06.312 --> 19:07.912
Thank you for pushing me.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.280
We need to do that
kind of thing for each other.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.915
Yes, please.

19:10.917 --> 19:12.917
I agree, unless,

19:12.919 --> 19:15.119
of course, it's about me using
face wash all over my body.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.989
Ah, this again, really? I don't
care that it's expensive.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.691
I know that you don't care.
I'm just gonna keep on doing it.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.660
(music playing)
Oh, ice cream truck! Oh!

19:22.662 --> 19:23.928
Right this way!

19:23.930 --> 19:25.296
Here we go, sir.
Here we go, sir.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.964
Here we go, sir.
All right, stop!

19:26.966 --> 19:29.800
(music playing)

19:29.802 --> 19:31.702
Ice cream, man, open up.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.471
Where the ice cream at?

19:33.473 --> 19:35.506
Can I buy you
some ice cream?

19:35.508 --> 19:37.942
First, uh, I just want
to revisit that little moment

19:37.944 --> 19:39.277
in the basement
where you were like,

19:39.279 --> 19:41.646
"Hey, Reagan, you've been right
about a lot of stuff today."

19:41.648 --> 19:44.115
Really? I just want you to
specifically tell me what

19:44.117 --> 19:45.716
You are out of control.
I've been right about.

19:45.718 --> 19:47.552
You're a grown man.
I just think you should be

19:47.554 --> 19:49.053
able to say it.
(laughs) You dick.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.058
I have a crush on you.

19:54.060 --> 19:55.459
Hmm.

19:55.461 --> 19:56.794
There it is.

19:56.796 --> 19:57.862
I have a crush on you.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.063
Isn't that better?

19:59.065 --> 20:00.631
Now we can just
put it behind us,

20:00.633 --> 20:03.401
move on,
don't have to be weird.

20:03.403 --> 20:06.070
No, I, obviously, I-I know it's
not gonna be a problem, Reagan.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.672
I don't have any illusion

20:07.674 --> 20:09.373
that you're gonna go
for a guy like me.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.075
I am a total mess.
I understand that.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.511
I mean, you're-you're
beautiful,

20:13.513 --> 20:14.912
and-and you're smart,

20:14.914 --> 20:17.215
and you're-you're mean,

20:17.217 --> 20:18.749
but in a hot way.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.485
And-and you have the-the
mind of a electrician,

20:21.487 --> 20:24.689
which is so confusingly hot,
because that is not, like,

20:24.691 --> 20:25.957

21:08.301 --> 21:09.767
While you're gassing up,

21:09.769 --> 21:12.737
let's look at the stock merkins.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.639
Marts... Nope!

21:14.641 --> 21:16.574
Is this...
is this here?

21:16.576 --> 21:18.876
Or is it more here?
Your frame?

21:18.878 --> 21:20.745

to just be like,

21:20.747 --> 21:22.947

Scientists have discovered

a new kind of butter.

21:32.258 --> 21:34.258
I'm so sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.
