00:00.330 --> 00:01.380
ANNOUNCER:
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:01.380 --> 00:02.670
- Rayna! Have you gotten
my letters?

00:02.670 --> 00:04.080
I just want to talk to her.

00:04.080 --> 00:06.120
- Call 911.
Call 911...

00:06.120 --> 00:07.880
- Rayna! I just wanna
talk to you!

00:12.080 --> 00:13.210
- I wanna make a Gospel Album.

00:13.210 --> 00:14.830
- That's gonna be beautiful.

00:14.830 --> 00:16.540
- I think all kinds of
wonderful things

00:16.540 --> 00:17.750
are gonna start
happening to you.

00:26.460 --> 00:27.960
- I felt something for Damien.

00:39.790 --> 00:40.960
- What are you looking for?

00:42.500 --> 00:43.670
- Nothing.

00:45.620 --> 00:48.420
My goodness.
You made all this?

00:48.420 --> 00:50.380
- Yes, pancakes for Mom.
Bacon for you.

00:50.380 --> 00:52.120
- You're a sweet girl.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.120
- Well, I just figured since
you guys are finally recording,

00:54.120 --> 00:55.710
you should have
a good breakfast.

00:55.710 --> 00:57.040
- Thank you, baby.

00:57.040 --> 00:58.580
- Morning.
- Morning.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.750
- You get a chance
to tell her yet?

01:00.750 --> 01:02.710
- No.

01:02.710 --> 01:05.170
- What is this?

01:05.170 --> 01:06.830
No sign of fire anywhere?

01:06.830 --> 01:09.000
- Ha, ha, very funny.

01:09.000 --> 01:10.380
- Oh, my goodness.

01:10.380 --> 01:11.540
- Why are the
security guys back?

01:14.040 --> 01:15.670
- Our friend bailed
himself out of jail.

01:15.670 --> 01:17.750
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I was gonna tell you.

01:17.750 --> 01:19.500
- So he can just
come here anytime now?

01:19.500 --> 01:22.000
- No. He still has to stay
300 feet away from us.

01:22.000 --> 01:25.120
- Oh, that went so well
last time.

01:25.120 --> 01:26.830
- Yeah, well, this time we got
security for the both of you.

01:26.830 --> 01:28.620
- What?
- I'm sorry, baby.

01:28.620 --> 01:29.880
We can't take any chances.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.000
- Okay...

01:32.000 --> 01:35.040
Well, I'm gonna see Clay play
at the 5 Spot on Saturday, so...

01:35.040 --> 01:36.830
- Well, that's fine.
You're just gonna have to

01:36.830 --> 01:38.330
take one of the
security guys with you.

01:38.330 --> 01:40.380
- Mom, I'm not going to a show

01:40.380 --> 01:41.670
with a creepy dude
following me around.

01:41.670 --> 01:43.040
Are you kidding me?
- Yes, you are.

01:43.040 --> 01:45.250
We don't have any choice
in this matter.

01:45.250 --> 01:46.880
I'm sorry.
- Okay, I'm late.

01:46.880 --> 01:47.920
Can we talk about this later?

01:47.920 --> 01:49.170
- Not really.

01:54.790 --> 01:56.790
- So when it says in Isiah,

01:56.790 --> 02:01.460
"You will keep in perfect peace
those whose minds are steadfast

02:01.460 --> 02:03.460
because they trust in you,"
who is he talking about?

02:03.460 --> 02:05.120
I don't have perfect peace.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.540
Do you have perfect peace?

02:07.540 --> 02:10.080
Maybe he's talking
about inner peace.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.250
But who's got that?

02:11.250 --> 02:13.580
So this is the challenge.

02:13.580 --> 02:16.540
If you're not in perfect peace,

02:16.540 --> 02:21.040
it says you still have to find
what it means to trust.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.170
We all do.

02:24.170 --> 02:25.960
- This really interests you?

02:25.960 --> 02:27.790
- You kidding?

02:27.790 --> 02:29.580
- Who knew you were
secretly a dork?

02:29.580 --> 02:32.080
- (laughs) I love
what y'all do here.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.920
- (sighs)

02:33.920 --> 02:35.620
It's just kind of amazing.

02:37.170 --> 02:38.750
- Listen...

02:38.750 --> 02:41.290
I want to do my next album
with you and the choir.

02:41.290 --> 02:42.830
- What do you mean?

02:42.830 --> 02:45.170
- I want to do a gospel album.

02:45.170 --> 02:47.670
- You're kidding.

02:47.670 --> 02:49.710
- Why would I be kidding?

02:49.710 --> 02:52.540
- W-Well, it's not exactly
what you've done.

02:52.540 --> 02:56.460
- Which is why I want
to explore it.

02:56.460 --> 02:58.580
- Well, I just--I don't think
it's a great idea.

02:58.580 --> 02:59.750
- Why not?

02:59.750 --> 03:02.540
- You know why.

03:02.540 --> 03:05.380
- Come on, aren't we all equal
in the eyes of God?

03:05.380 --> 03:07.210
- (sighs)

03:07.210 --> 03:08.960
I don't know
how to say this.

03:08.960 --> 03:11.250
But, honestly, if that's
how you're looking at it,

03:11.250 --> 03:13.000
then you really don't
understand the problem.

03:14.460 --> 03:16.460
- I do. I do understand
the problem, okay?

03:16.460 --> 03:17.620
I'm not stupid.

03:19.290 --> 03:21.250
But I just hear the music.

03:21.250 --> 03:24.500
And it speaks to me.

03:24.500 --> 03:28.250
Now I want the chance
to explore it.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.000
And--does that make me selfish?

03:30.000 --> 03:32.380
Maybe. I don't know.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.620
But I do really want the chance

03:34.620 --> 03:39.250
to get that choir in a room
and ask them.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.830
Listen to what they
have to say about it.

03:40.830 --> 03:43.460
Do you feel comfortable
enough doing that?

03:45.170 --> 03:48.880
- Not really, but I will.

03:49.920 --> 03:51.080
- Thank you.

03:54.620 --> 03:56.170
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's okay.

03:59.830 --> 04:01.040
- I was stuck
in a conference call

04:01.040 --> 04:02.420
for the new Denzel movie.

04:02.420 --> 04:03.960
- "Romania for the Old West."
What do you think?

04:03.960 --> 04:05.290
- I would not know.

04:05.290 --> 04:06.620
- You look beautiful.

04:06.620 --> 04:08.460
- Oh, please.

04:08.460 --> 04:09.710
- It's true.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.790
- Thank you.
Um, so you said

04:12.790 --> 04:14.080
you wanted to see me
about something?

04:15.290 --> 04:17.170
- I did and I'm glad.

04:18.880 --> 04:20.580
- Was there something
you wanted to tell me?

04:20.580 --> 04:24.210
- Not tell you, no.
Just see you.

04:24.210 --> 04:25.830
- Oh, my...

04:25.830 --> 04:27.330
- Look, I don't want
to make you uncomfortable.

04:27.330 --> 04:29.670
And I'm not trying
to mess with you, but...

04:29.670 --> 04:31.380
something happened
between us.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.580
You know it and I know it.

04:34.580 --> 04:36.040
And I want to honor that.

04:38.290 --> 04:40.540
- I don't know what
I'm doing right now.

04:40.540 --> 04:41.710
- I never know what I'm doing.

04:43.540 --> 04:46.250
So here's what I suggest.
We eat lunch.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.580
- I'm not hungry.

04:47.580 --> 04:50.290
- Well, I eat lunch.
You pretend.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.170
We talk during that lunch.

04:52.170 --> 04:53.920
Get to know each other a little.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.290
And then I'll go back
to my hotel room.

04:55.290 --> 04:57.500
And you can go back
to your life.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.620
And you decide whether
you want to see me again.

05:00.620 --> 05:03.040
- Why is it me who decides that?
Why not you?

05:04.710 --> 05:06.330
- 'Cause you're
the beautiful girl,

05:06.330 --> 05:08.120
and I'm the frog.

05:08.120 --> 05:09.500
You always get to decide.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.080
- Hey! Hey, you!
Just stay right there!

05:22.250 --> 05:23.420
- I'm not moving.

05:23.420 --> 05:24.710
- Suspect at the James' house.

05:24.710 --> 05:25.750
Call Nashville PD.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.000
You just stay right there.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.960
- So you're gonna let him
stand out there right now

05:31.960 --> 05:33.960
just threatening my family?
You're gonna do that?

05:33.960 --> 05:35.460
- He's not threatening you
right now, he's taunting you.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.040
- Oh, he's taunting.
What is the diff--

05:37.040 --> 05:38.500
You know what?
- Take it easy.

05:38.500 --> 05:39.670
- I've had enough
of this right now, okay?

05:39.670 --> 05:41.330
I'm gonna end it right now.
- I'd gladly join you,

05:41.330 --> 05:42.960
but you can't, all right?

05:42.960 --> 05:44.580
All right, tell him.

05:44.580 --> 05:46.210
- Listen, an Order of Protection
states that Hockney

05:46.210 --> 05:48.500
can't come within 300 feet
of you and your family.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.040
But your front door
is exactly 317 feet

05:50.040 --> 05:53.040
from where he's standing.
We measured.

05:53.040 --> 05:54.120
- This is horrible!

05:54.120 --> 05:55.330
I mean, I don't understand.

05:55.330 --> 05:56.580
What is he trying to do?

05:56.580 --> 05:58.250
- Well, he wants your attention.

05:58.250 --> 05:59.330
And he's getting it.

05:59.330 --> 06:00.960
- This is insane.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.920
You're saying there's
nothing we can do here?

06:02.920 --> 06:05.120
- Stay alert, stay safe.

06:05.120 --> 06:06.330
You can move with us.

06:06.330 --> 06:08.170
We can wait for him to make
a mistake, which he will,

06:08.170 --> 06:09.380
because they always do.

06:09.380 --> 06:11.750
And when he does,
we put him away.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.420
- Yeah, but in the meantime,

06:13.420 --> 06:15.290
he's turning our lives
upside down.

06:15.290 --> 06:16.710
- You should think of him
like a terrorist.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.790
Because in a way, he is.

06:18.790 --> 06:20.080
Now his goal is to
disrupt your life.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.210
And to the extent you let him,
he wins.

06:22.210 --> 06:23.920
Trust me, all right?

06:23.920 --> 06:25.500
You'll get through this.

06:45.750 --> 06:47.960
- Please tell me
he's not still out there.

06:47.960 --> 06:50.830
- No, he's gone for now.

06:50.830 --> 06:52.790
God knows where.

06:52.790 --> 06:54.210
- (sighs)

06:54.210 --> 06:57.080
In addition to being terrifying,

06:57.080 --> 06:58.580
this is incredibly
inconvenient.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.710
- Yeah. I'm sorry, baby.

07:00.710 --> 07:03.920
- Daphne's got her concert.

07:03.920 --> 07:07.580
I've got the CMT Awards
next week and rehearsal.

07:07.580 --> 07:09.880
Oof, I didn't sleep a wink.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.290
(knocking on door)

07:12.290 --> 07:16.120
- Time to go, sweetie.
What's the matter?

07:16.120 --> 07:17.960
- My stomach hurts.

07:17.960 --> 07:21.170
- Oh, no. Since when?

07:21.170 --> 07:22.710
- Just this morning.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.170
- Do you think maybe
you're nervous

07:24.170 --> 07:25.710
about all the security stuff?

07:25.710 --> 07:27.500
- I don't know.

07:27.500 --> 07:29.580
- Why don't we go get
some food in you.

07:29.580 --> 07:30.670
See if that helps.

07:30.670 --> 07:31.960

- I need to go to the bathroom.

09:02.210 --> 09:05.250
(phone ringing)

09:05.250 --> 09:06.790
- I told you not to call me
when I'm at work.

09:06.790 --> 09:09.500
- I got my period.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.830
- Oh, wow. Congrats.

09:11.830 --> 09:14.750
I can help you
when I get home, okay?

09:14.750 --> 09:16.420
- I need help now.

09:16.420 --> 09:18.960
- What?
- I can't talk loud.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.040
I'm in the bathroom.

09:20.040 --> 09:21.580
My clothes got messed up.

09:21.580 --> 09:23.460
Now I can't go out.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.330
- Avery and the boys want some
chicken wings from Brother Z's.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.540
- Okay, cool.

09:27.540 --> 09:29.420
Um, sorry, so where are you now?

09:29.420 --> 09:31.080
- I'm in the bathroom.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.920
I need new clothes
and whatever else.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.540
- I'm sorry.
I cannot come right now.

09:35.540 --> 09:37.920
But I'm gonna figure
something out, okay?

09:37.920 --> 09:39.540
Just don't freak out.

09:39.540 --> 09:41.420
- Don't tell Mom, okay?

09:42.790 --> 09:44.040
Maddie?

09:47.250 --> 09:50.170
- Hey, there.
- Oh, hey.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.540
I didn't expect
to see you here.

09:51.540 --> 09:54.000
- Well, sometimes
the unexpected happens.

09:54.000 --> 09:56.170
- Uh-oh.
- Yeah...

09:56.170 --> 09:57.500
There coffee in there?
- In there.

09:59.790 --> 10:01.380
Why are you here?

10:01.380 --> 10:03.080
- Why am I here?
I'm here...

10:03.080 --> 10:04.580
'Cause I'm trying not
to kill the guy

10:04.580 --> 10:05.880
standing outside our house.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.330
- He's still there?

10:07.330 --> 10:09.420
- Well, he left in the night.

10:09.420 --> 10:10.830
But he'll be back.

10:10.830 --> 10:13.170
- Oh, my goodness.
I feel so bad for Rayna.

10:13.170 --> 10:14.750
- Yeah, the girls too.

10:14.750 --> 10:16.330
I mean, the whole thing
is just...

10:19.080 --> 10:20.380
I don't even want to talk
about, all right?

10:20.380 --> 10:21.880
What's going on with you?

10:21.880 --> 10:24.040
- Uh, boring things
compared to that.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.250
- Please bore me.
It'd be a relief.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.880
- Okay, well...

10:28.880 --> 10:31.880
Gunnar and I are supposedly
back together again.

10:31.880 --> 10:33.420
- I thought you were...

10:33.420 --> 10:35.210
- Yeah, well,
surprise, surprise.

10:35.210 --> 10:36.580
Now there's this other person

10:36.580 --> 10:39.460
I apparently have feelings for.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.170
- That English director?

10:43.170 --> 10:44.330
- Does everybody
know about that?

10:46.250 --> 10:47.540
- What matters is what
does Gunnar know.

10:47.540 --> 10:49.960
- Nothing. Well, something.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.210
But it's not like anything's
happened, so...

10:52.210 --> 10:54.330
- Yet.

10:54.330 --> 10:56.460
- I'm not gonna lie to anybody.
I can't do that.

10:56.460 --> 11:00.790
- Well, that's good.
Never works anyway.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.080
- Yeah. I remember you and Rayna

11:02.080 --> 11:03.460
sneaking around
when I was little.

11:03.460 --> 11:06.290
Y'all were stressed
and miserable.

11:06.290 --> 11:08.620
- Yeah, we were.
I don't recommend it.

11:08.620 --> 11:09.960
It's just a big damn mess.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.460
- See, that's the thing.

11:11.460 --> 11:12.830
Doesn't matter how
I work it in my head.

11:12.830 --> 11:15.670
It just comes out
as a big damn mess.

11:15.670 --> 11:17.830
- (sighs) Oh, Scarlett.

11:17.830 --> 11:20.830
You know, all those years
I was so out of control,

11:20.830 --> 11:24.460
I was always asking myself...

11:24.460 --> 11:26.500
Is this who I am?

11:26.500 --> 11:29.460
You know, is this
the deepest part of me

11:29.460 --> 11:32.380
trying to express itself?

11:32.380 --> 11:36.210
Or is the dark part
just trying to take me down?

11:36.210 --> 11:39.120
I mean, I had
a pretty dark part.

11:39.120 --> 11:40.290
I don't know about you.

11:43.540 --> 11:44.960
- Well, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

11:44.960 --> 11:45.960
Can't just be with both of them.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.330
- What do you want to do?

11:50.830 --> 11:53.750
- Honestly, I want some time
to figure it out.

11:53.750 --> 11:55.210
I just don't see how
I'm gonna get that.

11:55.210 --> 11:57.170
- Well, as far as I know,
you're over 21.

11:57.170 --> 11:58.670
You can make your own
damn decisions.

11:58.670 --> 12:02.040
No matter what they think,
all right?

12:02.040 --> 12:04.380
Me? I think it's probably
one of those deals

12:04.380 --> 12:06.080
where you're just gonna have to
let the wave take you.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.920
- I was afraid you were
gonna say that!

12:10.920 --> 12:13.000
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

12:16.460 --> 12:20.380
- Daphne?

12:20.380 --> 12:22.210
Daphne? Are you in here?

12:26.460 --> 12:29.170
- I can't believe
Maddie called you.

12:29.170 --> 12:30.620
- Well, of course,
she did, honey.

12:30.620 --> 12:32.420
Where are you?

12:32.420 --> 12:33.960
You down here at the end?

12:36.710 --> 12:40.380
Hey, I brought you
a change of clothes.

12:40.380 --> 12:42.620
I brought you everything
you need, okay?

12:42.620 --> 12:44.620
You wanna open the stall for me?

12:44.620 --> 12:47.120
- Everybody's gonna know.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.790
- They're not gonna know--
you're gonna change your clothes

12:48.790 --> 12:50.380
and it's gonna be fine.

12:50.380 --> 12:52.880
- They're just gonna ask me
where I've been.

12:52.880 --> 12:54.960
- Honey, we talked about this
when it happened to Maddie.

12:54.960 --> 12:56.620
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

12:56.620 --> 12:58.040
It happens to every single girl.

13:00.210 --> 13:01.620
I'm gonna slide this
under the door, okay?

13:01.620 --> 13:03.710
And I'll give you
a little bit of privacy.

13:04.790 --> 13:06.250
I'll be right over here.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.790
If you need anything,
you call me, all right?

13:19.120 --> 13:20.460
- I didn't hear you say that!

13:20.460 --> 13:22.040
What did you want me
to do, Daphne?

13:22.040 --> 13:23.670
- You were still on the phone!

13:23.670 --> 13:24.960
You are such a liar!

13:24.960 --> 13:26.420
- I would never lie about that!
Get a grip!

13:26.420 --> 13:28.080
- What's going on?
- Where's Mom?

13:28.080 --> 13:29.290
- She's on her way home.
What's happening here?

13:29.290 --> 13:30.670
Is she okay?
- Just having a bad day.

13:30.670 --> 13:32.580
- You made me look like an idiot

13:32.580 --> 13:34.420
in front of everyone!
- Oh, my God, Daphne, listen!

13:34.420 --> 13:35.790
I get that you're having
a tough day and I'm sorry.

13:35.790 --> 13:36.960
But you can't be
treating me like this!

13:36.960 --> 13:38.620
I did nothing wrong!

13:38.620 --> 13:40.120
You need to talk to her!

13:46.790 --> 13:48.540
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:50.040 --> 13:52.710
- Be prepared for some pushback.

13:52.710 --> 13:54.670
- You know how many people
have said that to me?

13:54.670 --> 13:56.580
- I get it. You're a force.

13:56.580 --> 14:00.000
But this church, this music,
these people.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.790
It's new for you.
It's new for them too.

14:02.790 --> 14:04.620
- Well, I respect
everybody in there.

14:04.620 --> 14:08.000
- Well, I know that.
But not all of them do.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.120
- Do you understand
that if this happens,

14:10.120 --> 14:12.290
you get to introduce
the world to your gift?

14:12.290 --> 14:13.380
- What do you mean?

14:13.380 --> 14:15.290
- Whether or not this works out,

14:15.290 --> 14:18.250
you're still gonna record
an album just like I said.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.420
I'm gonna push Highway 65
to sign you.

14:20.420 --> 14:22.250
- Wait. What?

14:22.250 --> 14:23.830
- I am.

14:23.830 --> 14:25.290
Rayna James ain't
the only girl in this town

14:25.290 --> 14:26.460
with an eye for talent.

14:29.920 --> 14:32.460
- I know that some of y'all
have met my friend, Juliette.

14:32.460 --> 14:36.330
She's become truly committed
to what we are doing here.

14:36.330 --> 14:38.380
And you know she's had
some hard times.

14:38.380 --> 14:40.290
That's how we met.

14:40.290 --> 14:42.920
She has something
to say to y'all.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.040
And she really appreciates
you giving her the time.

14:45.040 --> 14:48.250
- How you guys doing?
- Good.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.460
- Good.

14:50.460 --> 14:52.540
I want to start off by saying

14:52.540 --> 14:56.080
I have so much respect and
admiration for this church.

14:56.080 --> 14:57.670
And for the music you guys
are making here.

14:57.670 --> 14:59.710
And because of that,

14:59.710 --> 15:02.500
I want my next album
to be a gospel album.

15:02.500 --> 15:05.500
And I would be honored if y'all
would record it with me.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.460
- Wow.
- Ooh.

15:07.460 --> 15:09.330
- Thank you, Juliette.

15:09.330 --> 15:10.380
Thank you too, Hallie.

15:10.380 --> 15:12.540
This sounds amazing.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.710
Anyone have any thoughts?

15:15.790 --> 15:18.210
- Hello, Juliette.
Thank you for your visit.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.210
And thank you
for the invitation.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.250
My name's Vonetta.

15:21.250 --> 15:22.790
- Nice to see you again.

15:22.790 --> 15:26.290
- Okay, so why gospel music?

15:26.290 --> 15:28.250
I mean, for us
it's a sacred thing.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.290
- Well, it's sacred
for me too now,

15:30.290 --> 15:32.040
now that I've been here.

15:32.040 --> 15:35.330
And as an artist, I'd like
the opportunity to explore it.

15:35.330 --> 15:36.460
With your help, of course.

15:36.460 --> 15:39.080
- As backup singers or what?

15:39.080 --> 15:41.750
- No, as partners.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.380
- How's that gonna work?

15:43.380 --> 15:45.830
- I don't know yet.

15:45.830 --> 15:47.000
I still have to figure that out.

15:47.000 --> 15:48.620
I haven't started writing songs.

15:48.620 --> 15:50.830
- You mean,
this would be your songs?

15:50.830 --> 15:52.330
Not what we're sing here?

15:52.330 --> 15:54.380
- No, no, no.
We will definitely

15:54.380 --> 15:56.620
record the songs
that you guys sing here.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.790
I just want to write
a few songs myself

15:58.790 --> 16:00.420
that fit with what you're doing.

16:00.420 --> 16:03.460
Maybe you guys would
want to write a song.

16:03.460 --> 16:05.040
I would totally be open to that.

16:05.040 --> 16:07.540
(group murmurs)

16:07.540 --> 16:09.420
- Yeah, yeah.

16:09.420 --> 16:11.380
- I'm just curious.

16:11.380 --> 16:12.540
How long you been listening
to gospel music?

16:14.620 --> 16:15.790
- A few months.

16:17.420 --> 16:18.920
- And how long you been
going to church?

16:18.920 --> 16:22.540
Any church?
Not just this one.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.080
- Probably the same
amount of time.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.290
- So you think that's
enough time to know

16:26.290 --> 16:28.960
why we come here
together every week?

16:28.960 --> 16:30.580
Work so hard on this?

16:30.580 --> 16:31.790
What this means to us?

16:33.040 --> 16:36.080
- No, no. I absolutely don't.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.580
And I don't think I ever could.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.880
- You just love the music.

16:38.880 --> 16:43.250
- Yes. Yes!
I just love the music.

16:43.250 --> 16:47.540
- Which means it has
no context for you.

16:47.540 --> 16:48.540
No meaning that sets it apart.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.210
- That's not true.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.040
You just have to
listen to the music

16:52.040 --> 16:53.710
to know what sets it apart.

16:53.710 --> 16:56.380
I feel like I'm transported
when I hear your music.

16:56.380 --> 16:58.040
- I'm glad for you.
That's good for you.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.380
- Maureen, give
the girl a break.

16:59.380 --> 17:01.500
- I'm just asking.
- Let her ask.

17:01.500 --> 17:03.710
- I mean, you know
this is black music, right?

17:03.710 --> 17:06.120
(laughter)

17:06.120 --> 17:07.580
- Yeah, I figured that out.

17:07.580 --> 17:10.250
- And even if it was white,
gospel music?

17:10.250 --> 17:13.880
I mean, isn't your thing
a little sexier than that?

17:13.880 --> 17:15.670
(laughter)

17:15.670 --> 17:17.620
- Oh, yeah, I'm looking
real sexy right about now.

17:19.670 --> 17:22.120
- So you're gonna pay us?
- Of course, I'll pay you.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.750
I pay everybody
I work with top dollar.

17:23.750 --> 17:25.330
You can ask anybody.

17:25.330 --> 17:27.380
- So you just got it
all figured out then?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.250
- I'm making a serious
proposition here.

17:29.250 --> 17:32.000
- Sounds good to me.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.120
- Our religion isn't a business.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.580
- Oh, and you think
that making a gospel album

17:36.580 --> 17:37.830
is good business for me?

17:37.830 --> 17:39.670
- Sorry to cause you
such difficulty.

17:39.670 --> 17:42.710
- Excuse me. You're the one
who brought up business.

17:42.710 --> 17:44.380
You don't see me twisting
your arm to be a part of this.

17:44.380 --> 17:46.330
- I see you coming in here
telling us what we're gonna do.

17:46.330 --> 17:47.960
- Oh, don't give me that!

17:47.960 --> 17:49.500
I'm not telling you anything.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.250
And I'm questioning these people

17:51.250 --> 17:53.000
because you have obviously
made up your mind.

17:53.000 --> 17:54.750
(all talking at once)

18:10.750 --> 18:13.330
- Hey, beautiful.
Ready to play?

18:18.670 --> 18:20.580
- (sigh) We need to talk.

18:24.960 --> 18:26.830
- He's back in town.

18:26.830 --> 18:28.120
- Oh, he never left.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.670
- I knew it.

18:30.670 --> 18:31.750
And you been seeing him.

18:31.750 --> 18:33.580
- I met him for lunch.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.040
- So in other words,
you slept with him.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.080
- No.

18:37.080 --> 18:38.420
- But you're going to.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.960
I can't believe this.

18:43.960 --> 18:45.290
Can't you see I'm just
trying to be with you?

18:45.290 --> 18:47.710
- Will you listen to me?
- Do you see that?

18:47.710 --> 18:48.790
Do you see that things
are different now?

18:48.790 --> 18:49.960
- Sit down.

18:57.330 --> 18:59.750
I've decided that I can't really
be with anyone right now.

18:59.750 --> 19:03.580
I'm sorry.

19:03.580 --> 19:04.830
- What are you saying?

19:04.830 --> 19:07.540
- I'm saying that...

19:07.540 --> 19:08.880
I feel something
for this person.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.120
And I don't know what it means.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.250
And I need time
to figure it out.

19:15.250 --> 19:18.170
- So you're breaking up with me.

19:18.170 --> 19:20.210
- I can't be in a committed
relationship right now.

19:21.620 --> 19:23.170
And I don't know
what that means.

19:23.170 --> 19:26.080
We could see each other or not.

19:26.080 --> 19:27.460
I just know that
I'm not going to cheat,

19:27.460 --> 19:28.960
and I'm not going to lie.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.830
- So you are gonna
sleep with him.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.580
- Not everything is about sex.

19:32.580 --> 19:34.880
I need to go and be with myself.
It's not either/or.

19:34.880 --> 19:37.620
- No, no, you either are
gonna sleep with the guy

19:37.620 --> 19:38.920
or you're not.

19:42.710 --> 19:43.880
- Look at me.

19:50.380 --> 19:54.120
So much has happened
between us that I'm numb.

19:56.540 --> 19:59.670
I don't feel anything
for you right now.

19:59.670 --> 20:02.880
And that scares me.

20:02.880 --> 20:06.040
It scares me that I could feel
something for anyone else.

20:06.040 --> 20:08.120
But I'm not going to let
fear stop me anymore.

20:08.120 --> 20:11.830
That is it, and I'm sorry
that it's upsetting.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.620
You can deal with it
in any way you need to.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.080
- Yeah, that's fine.

20:23.080 --> 20:24.540
Just sleep with the guy.

20:26.210 --> 20:28.040
- Did you hear a word I said?

20:28.040 --> 20:29.670
- I heard everything
I need to know.

20:32.880 --> 20:34.670
- (sighs)

20:39.580 --> 20:41.750
- Hey, babe.
How'd things go at the church?

20:43.500 --> 20:45.620
- Hit a little bump,
but we'll work it out.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.000
- Yeah, I'm sure you will.

20:48.790 --> 20:52.500
Oh, hey, the uh--
the new track?

20:52.500 --> 20:54.670
What'd you think?

20:54.670 --> 20:56.670
- I think that it's great

20:56.670 --> 20:58.330
that you're getting
back to your roots.

20:58.330 --> 21:01.830
- Yeah...And?

21:03.750 --> 21:05.330
- You have an amazing band.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.620
They're incredible.

21:06.620 --> 21:08.330
- What'd you think of the song?

21:11.580 --> 21:13.170
Oh, boy.

21:13.170 --> 21:16.580
- No, it's good, it's good.

21:16.580 --> 21:19.120
It is, okay?

21:19.120 --> 21:22.830
Just you're not
this angry kid anymore.

21:22.830 --> 21:24.960
Haven't you matured
past this a little bit?

21:24.960 --> 21:28.290
- Uh, no.

21:28.290 --> 21:30.670
But thanks for the feedback.

21:32.210 --> 21:34.710
- Come on--
I'm just being honest.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.790
- I feel like I'd like to do
something special for Daphne.

21:39.790 --> 21:42.210
You know, since she
got her period.

21:42.210 --> 21:43.670
I don't know.
It's a big milestone.

21:45.120 --> 21:47.580
- That usually what happens?

21:47.580 --> 21:49.040
- I have no idea.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.670
I got my period the week
after my mother died.

21:51.670 --> 21:53.790
That was awful.

21:53.790 --> 21:55.120
Nobody around to help me.

21:55.120 --> 21:56.500
I had to figure it
all out by myself.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.290
- Oh, baby,
I can't even imagine.

21:58.290 --> 22:01.790
- No, honey, you can't.

22:01.790 --> 22:04.620
Anyway, that's why I wanted
just--I don't know.

22:04.620 --> 22:06.290
I just want to make it
better for her.

22:06.290 --> 22:09.960
- Absolutely.
Let's throw her a party.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.670
- A period party?

22:13.670 --> 22:14.920
- Is that not a thing?

22:14.920 --> 22:17.750
- No, honey, that's not a thing.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.330
(laughter)

22:21.420 --> 22:23.460
I think you're gonna have to
leave this one to me.

22:26.080 --> 22:28.040
- Listen, I was thinking
maybe we could

22:28.040 --> 22:29.420
get in a recording session
tomorrow night, like late.

22:29.420 --> 22:31.290
- Are you changing the subject?

22:31.290 --> 22:33.250
- I'm trying, yeah.
- Yeah, you really are.

22:33.250 --> 22:34.750
Yes, I would like to do that.

22:34.750 --> 22:36.080
- All right.
- I've got a bunch of stuff

22:36.080 --> 22:37.500
I have to do
at the office tomorrow.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.210
And then I'm all yours.

22:39.210 --> 22:41.040
- All right. I'll tell the guys.

22:41.040 --> 22:42.210
- All right. I'll see you.
- All right.

22:42.210 --> 22:43.580
- Where you going?

22:43.580 --> 22:46.290
Don't wanna talk about
periods anymore?

22:46.290 --> 22:48.540
- You giving me a hard time?
- Mm-hmm.

22:48.540 --> 22:49.710
- Is that what you're doing?

22:56.750 --> 22:59.620
- Good God, I love you.

22:59.620 --> 23:02.620
- How much?

23:02.620 --> 23:03.880
- You want me to show you?

23:03.880 --> 23:05.210
- Yeah.

23:09.290 --> 23:11.540
- All right, I'll show you.

23:11.540 --> 23:13.000
- Okay.
- All right.

23:16.790 --> 23:18.790
(cell phone rings)

23:23.120 --> 23:25.250
- Happy Saturday.
- What's up?

23:25.250 --> 23:27.040
- Wanted to make sure
you're okay.

23:27.040 --> 23:30.330
You ran out of class
and never came back.

23:30.330 --> 23:32.670
- Yeah. Honestly,
that was nothing.

23:32.670 --> 23:34.460
But thank you for asking.

23:34.460 --> 23:36.120
- Some of us were gonna
maybe go hang out

23:36.120 --> 23:39.500
in Ryan's back yard.

23:39.500 --> 23:40.790
- I have concert rehearsal.

23:40.790 --> 23:42.790
But maybe after,
I could stop by.

23:42.790 --> 23:44.460
- Awesome.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.120
- I'll see you later.
I gotta go.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.620
- Hi. How you feeling today?

23:50.620 --> 23:52.620
- I'm okay.
- Good.

23:52.620 --> 23:54.210
- What is that?

23:54.210 --> 23:56.210
- Just something for you.

23:56.210 --> 23:58.210
- For what?

23:58.210 --> 24:00.500
- You know.
Yesterday was a big day.

24:00.500 --> 24:02.920
This is called
a first moon gift.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.170
- Oh, my God, Mom.
It happens to everyone.

24:05.170 --> 24:08.040
- I know, but this time
it happened to you, so...

24:08.040 --> 24:11.330
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

24:11.330 --> 24:12.710
How come you didn't
want me to know

24:12.710 --> 24:14.420
what was going on yesterday?

24:14.420 --> 24:16.880
- Because I knew you'd make
a big deal out of it.

24:16.880 --> 24:18.120
Which you are doing.

24:18.120 --> 24:19.750
- Well, you are
a big deal to me.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.330
- Mom...

24:21.330 --> 24:24.120
- Hey, look, babe.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.960
You're my treasure.

24:25.960 --> 24:29.540
And even if it embarrasses
the hell out of you,

24:29.540 --> 24:32.710
it's always gonna be my pride
and joy as your mother

24:32.710 --> 24:35.920
to celebrate every single
milestone with you.

24:37.710 --> 24:39.580
- Thank you.
(text message rings)

24:41.710 --> 24:43.880
My ride's here. I gotta go.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.920
- Okay. Love you.

24:50.830 --> 24:53.830
- Please don't say
I'm a woman now.

24:53.830 --> 24:57.670
- Oh, I won't,
because you're not.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.830
- I'm going to Clay's show,
and I'm going alone.

24:59.830 --> 25:01.330
- No, you're not going alone.

25:01.330 --> 25:03.920
- Well, feel free
to arrest me then.

25:06.920 --> 25:09.670
- Bye, mom.
- Oh...

25:09.670 --> 25:11.250
Bye.

25:24.920 --> 25:26.710
- I want to apologize.

25:26.710 --> 25:29.540
I didn't mean to offend
anybody yesterday.

25:29.540 --> 25:31.380
Or put myself in your shoes.

25:31.380 --> 25:33.960
Or act like I know everything.

25:33.960 --> 25:37.170
Or tell anything about what it
means to perform your music.

25:37.170 --> 25:39.250
I've made a good living
off of this.

25:39.250 --> 25:40.920
And I'm grateful for that.

25:40.920 --> 25:43.540
That doesn't mean that
I've lived a good life.

25:45.580 --> 25:49.830
I've sinned a lot.

25:49.830 --> 25:51.330
And I've hurt just
about everybody

25:51.330 --> 25:54.620
that's ever cared about me.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.620
Hurt myself.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.330
I lived my life
like a freight train,

25:58.330 --> 26:01.710
and I ran over anybody
who got in my way.

26:01.710 --> 26:03.040
I can't change that.

26:06.460 --> 26:08.920
But we all know that God
works in mysterious ways.

26:08.920 --> 26:12.790
And not that long ago when I was
napping on death's doorstep,

26:12.790 --> 26:14.580
He paid me a visit.

26:14.580 --> 26:16.540
And He gave me a gift.

26:16.540 --> 26:19.540
That was this place,
and all of you.

26:19.540 --> 26:22.830
And your music.

26:22.830 --> 26:24.330
And this incredible
woman over here.

26:27.210 --> 26:28.460
I don't want to steal from you.

26:28.460 --> 26:30.250
I want to honor you.

26:30.250 --> 26:34.000
I want to honor God
and his mysterious ways.

26:34.000 --> 26:38.290
And if you want to help me
share your gift with the world,

26:38.290 --> 26:40.620
then I think you might just
open some hearts and minds

26:40.620 --> 26:44.250
that are cold.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.170
Just like mine was
before I met you.

26:46.170 --> 26:50.880
And if you don't want
to participate, then...

26:50.880 --> 26:54.710
I'm gonna keep coming
back here to bible study.

26:54.710 --> 26:56.580
And work on it myself.
If that's okay with you.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.750
I realize that I'm
just a guest here.

27:03.120 --> 27:05.460
Thank you.

27:13.620 --> 27:15.000
- Come on back, girl.

27:16.920 --> 27:18.790
Don't we gotta figure out
what you want us to sing?

27:18.790 --> 27:19.960
(laughter)

27:24.790 --> 27:26.000
Come on.

27:28.710 --> 27:31.790

27:31.790 --> 27:35.330

♪ Oh oh ♪

28:36.960 --> 28:38.120
- This looks great.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.710
Now I know you said
you weren't hungry, so...

28:43.710 --> 28:45.380
these waffles are all mine.

28:49.460 --> 28:51.000
What's up?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.000
- I should go.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.420
- No, you shouldn't.

28:53.420 --> 28:54.920
- I should.

28:54.920 --> 28:56.080
- Did I do something wrong?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.670
- (laughs)

28:57.670 --> 28:59.120
- A minute ago, you were
having quite a lot of fun.

28:59.120 --> 29:01.000
- Yeah. And now I gotta go.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.540
- Because?

29:04.540 --> 29:06.620
- You didn't do
anything wrong, okay.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.500
It was fun. Too much fun.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.080
More fun than I should be
having right now.

29:10.080 --> 29:11.710
- Oh, no, that's terrible.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.080
- Don't start.

29:13.080 --> 29:14.750
- Well, what if I promise
no more fun?

29:14.750 --> 29:16.040
- I'd say that you were
lying to me.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.210
- Yeah...

29:18.920 --> 29:20.420
- Hi.

29:20.420 --> 29:21.960
- Can't believe you came.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.540
- Well, I did.

29:23.540 --> 29:26.210
Clay, that just about
blew my mind.

29:26.210 --> 29:27.790
- Wait. Seriously?

29:27.790 --> 29:29.670
- You are an incredible
musician.

29:29.670 --> 29:31.880
I mean, you got
the soul of a poet.

29:31.880 --> 29:34.120
Tell you what.
That was a pleasure. Thank you.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.790
- Uh, wow--I have no
idea what to say.

29:37.790 --> 29:41.420
- Well, I would say

29:41.420 --> 29:43.710
I think you should come down
to my office at Highway 65.

29:43.710 --> 29:45.540
Let's have a conversation.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.420
No, I'm not talking about
going into business together.

29:47.420 --> 29:49.920
But I think I could
give you some guidance

29:49.920 --> 29:52.960
in terms of your future,
and doing it on your own terms.

29:52.960 --> 29:55.920
- That's amazing.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.420
- But you got to
take care of this one,

29:57.420 --> 29:58.960
because I don't mess around.
You hear me?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.540
(laughter)
- Yes, ma'am.

30:02.830 --> 30:04.710
- And I gotta get
you home, honey.

30:04.710 --> 30:06.380
You can't be out like this with
all this craziness going on.

30:06.380 --> 30:07.880
- Okay.

30:07.880 --> 30:09.920
- Maybe I can drop her off.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.290
- Okay, but one of
these gentlemen's

30:14.290 --> 30:16.210
gonna have to go
with you, okay?

30:16.210 --> 30:18.580
'Cause I have to make sure
Maddie gets home safe.

30:18.580 --> 30:21.540
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:21.540 --> 30:23.290
- Okay. I love you.
- I love you too.

30:27.880 --> 30:29.580
Let's go gentlemen.

30:51.830 --> 30:54.380
- I'll be in the car.
- Thank you.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.670
(music playing)

31:14.750 --> 31:16.880
- No, no, no! Don't be scared!
- No!

31:16.880 --> 31:19.250
- Don't be scared! Please!

31:19.250 --> 31:20.830
Everything's gonna be okay.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.620
- I know your security guy's
outside, Rayna--

31:26.620 --> 31:27.830
I mean, Ms. James.

31:27.830 --> 31:28.830
And he has nothing
to worry about,

31:28.830 --> 31:30.830
and neither do you.
I promise.

31:30.830 --> 31:32.380
Is it the knife
that's scaring you?

31:32.380 --> 31:34.040
I don't even know
why I brought it.

31:34.040 --> 31:35.620
It's not even sharp.

31:35.620 --> 31:38.120
I just didn't know what
or who would be here.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.580
See? I'll put it away.

31:44.420 --> 31:45.920
Put it away.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.620
Oh, please don't
touch that phone.

31:51.620 --> 31:53.710
- What do you want?

31:53.710 --> 31:57.420
- I just want to talk to you.

31:57.420 --> 31:58.500
- You just wanna talk to me?

31:58.500 --> 32:00.620
- Not like this. I just...

32:00.620 --> 32:02.330
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

32:02.330 --> 32:04.620
I didn't mean for it
to be like this. I'm sorry.

32:04.620 --> 32:07.960
- Listen, Mr. Hockney...

32:07.960 --> 32:10.460
- You don't have to
call me that.

32:10.460 --> 32:13.500
You can call me Wayne.

32:13.500 --> 32:14.670
- I thought your name was Carl.

32:14.670 --> 32:17.080
Is Wayne your middle name?

32:17.080 --> 32:20.670
- Yeah. How do you know that?

32:20.670 --> 32:23.750
- My husband goes
by his middle name.

32:26.120 --> 32:28.080
- That's cool. See?

32:28.080 --> 32:29.250
We have something in common.

32:31.710 --> 32:33.750
I mean, Wayne sounds
better than Carl anyway.

32:33.750 --> 32:36.920
- Yeah, it does.
Wayne's a good name.

32:39.170 --> 32:41.920
- Thank you, ma'am.

32:45.330 --> 32:46.880
- So how'd you get in here,
Wayne?

32:49.080 --> 32:52.000
- I came in yesterday in your
normal business hours,

32:52.000 --> 32:54.880
and I hid in the broom closet.

32:54.880 --> 32:58.080
- You must have really wanted
to talk to me, huh?

32:58.080 --> 33:01.830
- Yeah. I just want you
to understand something.

33:01.830 --> 33:04.670
- What do you want me
to understand?

33:04.670 --> 33:06.330
- Well, it's what I've been
trying to tell you for weeks.

33:06.330 --> 33:08.710
But everybody keeps
getting in the way.

33:08.710 --> 33:10.250
I mean, this whole
thing's been crazy.

33:10.250 --> 33:12.290
You know, at first
I was too shy.

33:12.290 --> 33:14.790
And then I guess people
thought I was following you.

33:14.790 --> 33:16.540
- Well, you were following me.

33:16.540 --> 33:18.330
- No, not like that.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.120
I just wanted to talk to you
and I didn't know how...

33:21.120 --> 33:22.710
I understand that
I've made this worse.

33:25.540 --> 33:28.460
- So you wanted to talk to me.

33:28.460 --> 33:32.580
- Yes, I, uh...

33:32.580 --> 33:35.750
I wanted to tell you
how connected we are.

33:35.750 --> 33:38.460
- How are we connected, Wayne?

33:38.460 --> 33:40.540
Other than the fact that
you're holding me hostage.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.960
- I'm not holding you hostage!

33:42.960 --> 33:45.460
I just wanted to have
a conversation with you,

33:45.460 --> 33:48.290
and this is what it took.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.120
- Well, I certainly don't
feel very safe right now.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.670
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

33:51.670 --> 33:53.330
I didn't mean for it
to be like this at all.

33:53.330 --> 33:54.580
- Then can I leave?

33:54.580 --> 33:56.710
- No. No, no, no.

33:56.710 --> 33:58.000
Not until I say
what I have to say.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.420
- Okay, then say it.

34:00.420 --> 34:02.920
- Oh, I'm screwing this up.
This is what I always do.

34:02.920 --> 34:05.580
- Well, Wayne, I think it'd just
be best just to say it.

34:09.080 --> 34:11.960
- I wanted to tell you...

34:11.960 --> 34:15.540
that you understand me better
than anyone I've ever known.

34:17.500 --> 34:19.120
- How can that be true?
I just met you.

34:19.120 --> 34:22.710
- That's not true.

34:22.710 --> 34:24.290
You met me the day
I heard your first single

34:24.290 --> 34:27.620
on my Mom's stereo
back in West Memphis.

34:27.620 --> 34:31.920
You spoke to me in a way
that I couldn't speak to myself.

34:31.920 --> 34:34.960
You changed my life.

34:34.960 --> 34:38.500
You've known me
for a very long time.

34:38.500 --> 34:40.670
And all I've ever wanted
was to meet you.

34:40.670 --> 34:44.000
- Well, now you did,

34:44.000 --> 34:47.040
so it's okay.

34:48.710 --> 34:50.670
- Where you going?

34:50.670 --> 34:52.210
- I'm not going anywhere.

34:52.210 --> 34:53.830
- You don't care
what I'm saying.

34:53.830 --> 34:56.250
- I do care.
- You think that I don't know

34:56.250 --> 34:58.790
that you're just acting?
- I'm not...

34:58.790 --> 34:59.920
- That you're just
pretending to be nice?

34:59.920 --> 35:03.040
Like, oh, Wayne's a good name?

35:03.040 --> 35:04.420
As if you like my name?

35:04.420 --> 35:06.880
As if you even care
about my name?

35:06.880 --> 35:09.290
- I like your name, Wayne.

35:11.580 --> 35:13.250
- It was given to me
by an awful man.

35:16.170 --> 35:19.620
An alcoholic abuser
like your husband.

35:19.620 --> 35:21.210
- Deacon's not an abuser.

35:21.210 --> 35:24.290
- That's what they all say.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.750
That's what my Mom would say
when he beat her.

35:26.750 --> 35:30.540
And he'd beat me.

35:30.540 --> 35:31.830
- I'm sorry you
experienced that.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.040
- Stop that.
- Stop what?

35:34.040 --> 35:35.380
- Stop talking down to me!

35:35.380 --> 35:38.460
- I'm not talking down to you!

35:38.460 --> 35:39.500
I'm scared because
you're threatening me!

35:39.500 --> 35:41.960
- I'm not threatening you!

35:41.960 --> 35:44.290
I've never hurt a woman
in my life.

35:45.670 --> 35:48.500
- Well, that's good.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.170
- I'm the one that's hurt, okay?

35:50.170 --> 35:52.580
I thought you'd understand that.

35:52.580 --> 35:54.080
I wanted to talk to you

35:54.080 --> 35:55.500
'cause I could see
that you were different.

35:55.500 --> 35:57.040
You weren't like
the ones that lie,

35:57.040 --> 35:59.120
and make fun of me
behind my back.

35:59.120 --> 36:01.170
Make up stupid excuses like
I don't know what's going on.

36:06.250 --> 36:08.920
- Hey, give me a break, Wayne.

36:08.920 --> 36:10.710
Think you're the only person
who's ever been abused

36:10.710 --> 36:14.040
in your life?

36:14.040 --> 36:15.670
- I didn't say that.

36:15.670 --> 36:20.250
- Well, I've got
a story for you.

36:20.250 --> 36:24.170
And this is not something you're
gonna find on the internet.

36:24.170 --> 36:29.000
You wanna hear it?

36:29.000 --> 36:30.460
- Yeah.

36:30.460 --> 36:34.710
- All right. My father
was a sociopath.

36:36.210 --> 36:39.750
Killed my mother,
covered it up.

36:39.750 --> 36:43.920
And that happened
when I was 12 years old.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.000
And I have to deal with that
every day of my life.

36:46.000 --> 36:48.210
And then sometimes
it gets to me,

36:48.210 --> 36:50.790
and I overcompensate
with my husband.

36:50.790 --> 36:53.460
and in my business,

36:53.460 --> 36:55.580
and I say things to my daughters

36:55.580 --> 36:56.960
that I know deep down
are just gonna make 'em

36:56.960 --> 36:58.290
want to run away from me.

36:58.290 --> 37:02.420
But it's like I can't help it.

37:02.420 --> 37:05.880
'Cause that horror, it's just
right there at the surface.

37:05.880 --> 37:07.580
And I don't want them
to feel that.

37:07.580 --> 37:10.670
And I don't want them
to think I'm feeling it.

37:10.670 --> 37:14.960
So I write songs
and I sing them,

37:14.960 --> 37:17.080
'cause that's the only way I
know how to deal with this pain

37:17.080 --> 37:20.120
that I carry inside me.

37:20.120 --> 37:24.120
And that loser husband of mine?

37:24.120 --> 37:27.460
His daddy whipped him
every single day.

37:27.460 --> 37:28.920
And that's the same
piece of crap

37:28.920 --> 37:30.670
that got him drinking
in the fourth grade.

37:33.380 --> 37:36.290
How is it we can be so awful to
the people we love the most?

37:36.290 --> 37:39.750
That just makes me so angry.

37:39.750 --> 37:41.170
Makes me so sad.

37:45.960 --> 37:49.330
- That's why I wanted
to talk to you.

37:49.330 --> 37:51.080
- Wayne, I know you're carrying
that kind of pain too.

37:51.080 --> 37:53.420
I see that.

37:55.080 --> 37:57.790
But the only choice we have
is we got to go on.

37:57.790 --> 37:59.960
We can't give in to that.

37:59.960 --> 38:02.880
You give in to that,
that evil man, he wins.

38:02.880 --> 38:05.120
'Cause that means he broke you
just like he wanted to.

38:07.170 --> 38:09.750
Now you being here right now,
you're giving in to it.

38:12.920 --> 38:14.080
- Oh, God.

38:22.920 --> 38:24.210
- I bet it wasn't
just your daddy.

38:24.210 --> 38:26.500
Was it your mama too
who hurt you?

38:28.000 --> 38:29.080
- How'd you know?

38:29.080 --> 38:31.880
- I just--I just had a feeling.

38:35.420 --> 38:36.750
- She did things when she drank.

38:40.170 --> 38:41.830
- I'm sorry.

38:41.830 --> 38:45.670
- I knew you'd get it.

38:50.290 --> 38:53.580
- 911. What's your emergency...
- What am I hearing?

38:53.580 --> 38:55.920
- 911, what is...
- Show me your hands now!

39:00.710 --> 39:02.710
Why'd you do that?
I trusted you!

39:02.710 --> 39:05.620
- I have two daughters
who need me, okay?

39:05.620 --> 39:07.210
That's all I care
about right now!

39:07.210 --> 39:09.500
- I should kill you right now!

39:09.500 --> 39:13.250
- Wayne, I feel pain just
the same way you do.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.960
You killing me, that's not
gonna accomplish anything!

39:18.790 --> 39:19.960
- Oh, God, what do I do...

39:19.960 --> 39:24.330
Oh God...what do I do--

39:26.960 --> 39:28.460
- Dolan.
- Nashville PD.

39:28.460 --> 39:30.500
You're working with
Rayna James, right?

39:30.500 --> 39:32.750
- What is it?
- 911 from her phone.

39:32.750 --> 39:35.080
Location says it's her office.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.330
- Wayne, stop it! No!

39:38.330 --> 39:39.620
Please let me go, Wayne!

39:39.620 --> 39:41.290
You don't wanna do this!

39:41.290 --> 39:42.960
Calm down--the police are
gonna be here any second.

39:44.710 --> 39:46.920
Wayne?

39:46.920 --> 39:49.420
- Drop the weapon!
Let her go now!

39:49.420 --> 39:51.040
Drop the knife!

39:51.040 --> 39:53.250
I am not gonna ask you again!
Drop the weapon now!

39:53.250 --> 39:54.710
- Freeze!
- Drop it!

39:54.710 --> 39:56.000
- You gonna shoot me?

39:56.000 --> 39:58.000
- Put that knife down!
Put it down now!

39:58.000 --> 40:00.170
- They're not gonna shoot you.
I won't let them shoot you.

40:00.170 --> 40:02.540
Wayne, this is not who you are.

40:02.540 --> 40:04.120
Think about it.
This is not who you are.

40:04.120 --> 40:05.670
Don't give in.

40:05.670 --> 40:07.790
- Put it down, buddy...
- Please don't give in.

40:07.790 --> 40:10.790
You need to decide
who you really are, Wayne.

40:10.790 --> 40:14.000
Wayne...Wayne?

40:14.000 --> 40:15.290
- Let her go, pal.
Come on...

40:15.290 --> 40:17.500
- I'm sorry...
I'm sorry...

40:17.500 --> 40:20.880
- Wayne?
- I'm sorry...

40:22.790 --> 40:23.790
- Move!
- Out of the way!

40:23.790 --> 40:25.120
- Get on the ground!

40:27.960 --> 40:31.250
- Are you okay?
Did he hurt you?

40:31.250 --> 40:35.080
- We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

40:35.080 --> 40:36.620
It's over.

40:36.620 --> 40:38.290
- You have the right
to remain silent...

40:38.290 --> 40:39.920
anything you say can and will
be used against you...

40:39.920 --> 40:42.670
You have the right
to speak to an attorney...

40:58.960 --> 41:00.380
- Ms. James, are you okay?
- She's okay.

41:00.380 --> 41:01.540
We just need
to get her out of here.

41:06.420 --> 41:08.830
- We've got a squad car to take
you to the hospital, okay?

41:08.830 --> 41:10.120
- I don't wanna
go to the hospital.

41:10.120 --> 41:11.670
I just wanna go home.

41:23.040 --> 41:25.250
(cell phone rings)

41:27.540 --> 41:29.080
- Hey, we been waiting on you.

41:29.080 --> 41:31.420
- (crying)

41:31.420 --> 41:33.080
Baby, what happened?

41:35.420 --> 41:37.960
Rayna, what is it, sweetie?

41:37.960 --> 41:41.580
- Something terrible happened.

41:41.580 --> 41:45.790
It's okay, I'm okay...

41:45.790 --> 41:47.000
I'm coming home.

41:48.790 --> 41:50.080
- Come home, baby.

41:52.620 --> 41:55.580
(car horn honking)
