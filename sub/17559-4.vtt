[indistinct chatter]

00:10.635 --> 00:11.845
- Hey!
- Hi.

00:11.928 --> 00:13.680
Aren't you going to be
late for school?

00:13.763 --> 00:16.181
- Today's a half day.
- Since when?

00:16.265 --> 00:18.351
Since I woke up at 10:00.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.187
Okay, well, uh,
why are you eating here?

00:21.271 --> 00:22.605
I thought we agreed that from

00:22.689 --> 00:24.983
the hours of 8:00 a.m.
to 5:00 p.m. weekdays

00:25.066 --> 00:26.693
this was my office space.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.194
But you weren't here.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.863
Okay, that doesn't really
matter.

00:29.946 --> 00:32.615
At my old job, when I left my
office, it stayed my office.

00:32.698 --> 00:35.744
Oh, actually, sometimes the
girls and I did yoga in there.

00:36.661 --> 00:38.496
Can you just eat at the counter?

00:38.580 --> 00:41.374
I want to sit at a table
like a mature adult

00:41.458 --> 00:43.084
and eat my Fruity Pebbles.

00:44.127 --> 00:47.464
Okay, fine. You eat, I'll work.

00:47.547 --> 00:49.174
Fine.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.010
- Um, I..
- What?

00:52.093 --> 00:54.345
Your Fruity Pebbles
are on my folder.

01:04.563 --> 01:08.151
- What?
- Are you done with the milk?

01:08.234 --> 01:10.153
- I don't know.
- How can you not know?

01:10.236 --> 01:11.696
Because I've only had
two bites.

01:11.780 --> 01:15.366
I don't know if I have the
proper milk-to-cereal ratio yet.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.410
Okay, can you make an executive
decision about that?

01:17.494 --> 01:18.995
Because it's next
to my computer.

01:19.078 --> 01:20.830
You could spill.
It's like a ticking time bomb.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.208
Oh, my God.
Thank you for my recommended

01:23.291 --> 01:25.877
daily allowance of annoying!

01:25.960 --> 01:27.420
You know what? I am going to
have to ask you not to

01:27.504 --> 01:28.922
talk to me like
that in my office.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.965
Okay. You know what? Okay.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.842
I have tried to be
supportive of this whole

01:32.926 --> 01:35.678
working out of the house thing,
but you are driving me crazy!

01:35.762 --> 01:37.555
I can't use the computer
because you're always on it.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.057
And I can't use the phone
because you're always waiting

01:39.140 --> 01:42.352
for an "important call",
and now I can't even

01:42.435 --> 01:44.729
enjoy a leisurely brunch
before Math!

01:45.980 --> 01:48.399
Do you think this is easy
for me, a grown woman..

01:48.483 --> 01:49.776
...pretending this
is her office?

01:49.859 --> 01:51.236
You know what? I don't wanna
go through this again.

01:51.319 --> 01:53.029
I'll just sit at the
stupid coffee table.

01:53.112 --> 01:54.489
Thank you.

01:58.618 --> 02:01.162
- Val.
- What?

02:02.914 --> 02:04.582
- Hol?
- What?

02:04.666 --> 02:06.125
That's Lauren's office.

Okay, okay, this isn't bad.
This office could work.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.139
What do you guys think?

03:01.222 --> 03:03.099
Huh, it's nice.
It's got a toilet.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.894
- Where?
- We're in it.

03:05.977 --> 03:07.854
You know, for somebody that
wants me out of the apartment

03:07.937 --> 03:09.522
so bad, you're being
awfully picky.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.899
Well, this place is gross!

03:10.982 --> 03:12.609
I mean, I'm gonna have
to come visit you here

03:12.692 --> 03:16.029
and what if I want to bring
friends over? Oh, my God!

03:16.112 --> 03:18.948
We have seen 11
different offices.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.867
It's a little dingy. So what?

03:20.950 --> 03:23.661
It stinks like
feet in here!

03:23.745 --> 03:25.204
Come on, you guys.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.290
Would you please just try
to have a positive attitude?

03:27.373 --> 03:31.169
Okay. It stinks like
feet in here. Yay!

03:33.171 --> 03:34.672
It's still a step up, okay?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.215
Lauren, can you
get the landlord?

03:36.299 --> 03:39.302
Have you seen him?
I think anyone can get him.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.929
Val, you're not seriously
thinking about

03:41.012 --> 03:42.513
taking this place, are you?

03:42.597 --> 03:44.515
Celia's dad just got an office
in the Chrysler building.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.684
It's so nice. It's got a great
view, a nice reception area--

03:46.768 --> 03:50.813
Yeah. Celia's dad
is a successful, rich attorney.

03:50.897 --> 03:55.151
Excuse me. Uh, is Celia's dad
still with Celia's mom?

03:58.363 --> 04:00.198
Look, Val, you're
in the P.R. business.

04:00.281 --> 04:02.992
Don't you know people? Doesn't
anybody owe you any favors?

04:03.076 --> 04:04.953
What about pulling some strings?

04:05.036 --> 04:09.457
You are so cute. I love it that
you still believe in strings.

04:09.540 --> 04:11.000
Val, I hate when you do that.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.169
I hate it when you
treat me like I'm five.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.588
Well, one of these days
you're gonna have to figure out

04:15.672 --> 04:19.425
that what we want is not
necessarily what we can have.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.388
Oh, my God! I'm totally
getting that underarm flap.

04:25.556 --> 04:29.060
A little paint, a case
of Lysol, it'll be great.

04:29.143 --> 04:32.355
- Quitter.
- I'm sorry. What?

04:32.438 --> 04:34.148
Oh, she said "quitter".

04:34.232 --> 04:36.818
Yeah, you look at a few places,
and then you give up.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.861
That's not true, Holly.
I'm just being realistic.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.196
This is what we can afford.

04:40.279 --> 04:41.781
Oh, no, no, no.
You're being a quitter.

04:41.864 --> 04:43.700
See, that's the difference
between me and you.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.952
I think that
anything is possible..

04:46.035 --> 04:48.121
...and you are going to end up
in a rat hole like this

04:48.204 --> 04:51.791
because you don't think
outside the box.

04:51.874 --> 04:54.585
Okay, well, why don't you
saddle up that unicorn

04:54.669 --> 04:59.549
and fly off to the magical land
of strings and pull, pull, pull?

04:59.632 --> 05:01.384
- You find that office.
- Maybe I will.

05:01.467 --> 05:02.719
- Good.
- Yeah.

05:02.802 --> 05:06.222
And I guarantee you that
it won't smell of feet.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.516
Okay, you go get 'em, Holly.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.187
[instrumental music]

05:16.482 --> 05:18.026
So, was the office
really that bad?

05:18.109 --> 05:19.902
I mean, there had to be
something good about it.

05:19.986 --> 05:21.612
Mm, yeah, it had a big window.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.489
I guess if it got too hot,
you could open it up..

05:23.573 --> 05:27.076
...step out on the ledge,
jump off, and kill yourself.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.120
And you think you can
find a better place?

05:29.203 --> 05:32.248
I know I can.
I mean, I don't know what age

05:32.331 --> 05:33.875
people start giving up
on their dreams..

05:33.958 --> 05:35.835
...but I'm not gonna
let that happen to Val.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.337
- Damn, that's nice, Holly.
- Yeah.

05:38.421 --> 05:42.425
Plus, when I find the place, I
can totally rub her face in it.

05:42.508 --> 05:43.551
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

05:43.634 --> 05:44.761
Where have you been?

05:44.844 --> 05:46.929
Making 200 bucks
from a rich guy.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.848
I told ya.

05:48.931 --> 05:51.642
Bite me. I'm taking care
of the guy's plants.

05:51.726 --> 05:53.519
- What guy?
- Jay Miller.

05:53.603 --> 05:54.937
He owns the loft above us.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.939
You live in the same building
as Jay Miller?

05:57.023 --> 05:58.441
Man, y'all are rich, huh?

05:58.524 --> 06:00.568
Well, yeah.

06:00.651 --> 06:02.361
Who's Jay Miller?

06:02.445 --> 06:03.946
He's some stockbroker guy
who got put in jail

06:04.030 --> 06:05.364
for insider trading.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.408
Hey, so what's his place like?
Is it all rich?

06:07.492 --> 06:09.410
He's like a gazillionaire.
What do you think?

06:09.494 --> 06:13.331
I don't know why you always
use that hurtful tone with me.

06:13.414 --> 06:15.083
I think you're
a really nice person.

06:15.166 --> 06:16.542
What do you want?

06:16.626 --> 06:18.628
I want to see the
rich guy's apartment

06:18.711 --> 06:20.088
That's all you got?

06:20.171 --> 06:22.757
I mean, why couldn't you tell me
I'm pretty and charming?

06:22.840 --> 06:24.842
No, I don't want to
see it that bad.

06:24.926 --> 06:26.886
- I do.
- No, I don't know.

06:26.969 --> 06:28.346
Jay's kind of weird
about his place.

06:28.429 --> 06:31.891
Come on, pretty hair,
pretty skin, pretty eyes.

06:31.974 --> 06:33.601
Reowrr!

06:34.560 --> 06:35.728
Okay, okay.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.313
But, you know, once
we're in Jay's place

06:37.396 --> 06:39.732
you can't sit on anything,
you can't touch anything

06:39.816 --> 06:42.944
and you can't play
with anything.

06:43.027 --> 06:45.279
Why are you looking at me?

06:52.954 --> 06:54.497
Nice shot, dude.

06:54.580 --> 06:58.000
Yeah, Gary moves
real good in Armani.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.712
Oh, I love this chair!

07:01.796 --> 07:04.882
My butt and this chair have
formed a magical union.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.802
You guys, I told you
not to touch anything.

07:07.885 --> 07:09.428
I promised Jay.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.682
Uh-oh. You broke your promise
to the white-collar criminal.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.393
He might send you
a tersely worded letter.

07:15.476 --> 07:18.020
So, how long is this guy
going to be in the pokey?

07:18.104 --> 07:19.897
Five years.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.233
Man, would you guys
check this office out?

07:22.316 --> 07:25.611
I mean, his desk
is bigger than my house.

07:25.695 --> 07:30.032
Office? Oh, my God, five years?
This is it, Gary.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.202
Oh, my God, I am so outside
the box right now.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.538
You see what happens
when you dream?

07:35.621 --> 07:37.290
The long journey is over.

07:37.373 --> 07:40.877
This is what I've been
looking for all day!

07:40.960 --> 07:43.629
Wait a second. You think some
big-time Wall Street businessman

07:43.713 --> 07:45.214
is just gonna let you
move in here?

07:45.298 --> 07:46.841
Yeah, Holly, as much as
I'd like to have you live

07:46.924 --> 07:48.759
in my building,
it's not gonna happen.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.970
This guy turns down offers
to sublet every day.

07:51.053 --> 07:52.805
He doesn't need the money.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.724
Then we won't give him any!

07:54.807 --> 07:58.060
Oh, my God, the dream keeps
getting better and better!

07:58.144 --> 08:00.730
I'm calling Val.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.149
- Hey, Val?
- Hey. I can't talk right now.

08:03.232 --> 08:04.609
I'm on my way over
to sign a lease.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.237
I found a place.
It's practically odor-free.

08:08.321 --> 08:09.780
Wait. No, no, no.
Don't sign anything.

08:09.864 --> 08:11.616
I found the most
incredible place.

08:11.699 --> 08:14.202
Too late. I'm on my way over
to meet the landlord right now

08:14.285 --> 08:15.286
and give him a check.

08:15.369 --> 08:16.537
No, Val, come here first.

08:16.621 --> 08:18.956
I guarantee you it's
a billion times better.

08:19.040 --> 08:21.209
There are five other people
who want this place.

08:21.292 --> 08:22.501
I got to go.

08:22.585 --> 08:23.920
No, Val, meet me at
the Liberty Diner.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.296
It's practically
across the street.

08:25.379 --> 08:27.048
I promise you
you're gonna love it.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.926
Well, how big is it? How much
is it? How long is the lease?

08:30.009 --> 08:32.178
Huh? What?
Oh, losing you. Come now.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.309
Wow, this is unbelievable.

08:39.393 --> 08:41.687
Oh, my God, I know.
This is so exciting.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.357
No, Jay and I got
the same size dogs.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.704
(Holly)
'Not yet. Keep them closed.
Keep them closed.'

08:58.788 --> 09:03.042
Are they closed? Okay. Wait.
Okay, stop. Step.

09:03.125 --> 09:08.214
Okay. Not yet.
Okay, now, open!

09:08.297 --> 09:10.424
Oh, my God!

09:10.508 --> 09:15.221
I know! Office, home.
Nice office, huge home!

09:15.304 --> 09:17.181
And we'll still only
be paying one rent

09:17.265 --> 09:19.141
but we won't be tripping
all over each other.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.769
And, come on, how impressed
will her clients be

09:21.852 --> 09:23.437
when you bring them here?

09:23.521 --> 09:28.776
And I could learn
how to play the piano.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.653
And there's an espresso machine.

09:30.736 --> 09:34.949
I could offer our clients
fancy coffee and biscotti.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.325
Biscotti is so classy.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.453
The place I get waxed,
they have biscotti.

09:39.537 --> 09:42.498
Lauren's on board,
so what do you think?

09:42.581 --> 09:43.582
What are you thinking?

09:43.666 --> 09:45.501
Seriously, I..
We can't afford this.

09:45.584 --> 09:47.628
How do you know? You don't
even know how much it is!

09:47.712 --> 09:49.130
Oh, okay. How much is it?

09:49.213 --> 09:52.091
Here's the kicker--
He doesn't need the money!

09:53.759 --> 09:56.012
Well, I love it! It's so big.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.389
It makes me feel all
dainty and fragile.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.854
Holly, this place would go for
like $10-12,000 a month.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.106
Oh, actually ours goes for 15.

10:08.232 --> 10:09.775
Okay, Lauren, do me a favor.

10:09.859 --> 10:11.861
Call the landlord right now
and tell him we will be there

10:11.944 --> 10:13.404
in 15 minutes to sign the lease.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.114
I can't believe you dragged me
down here for this.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.408
Wait, Val, if I could
just cut in for a second.

10:17.491 --> 10:21.746
Um, now, the owner,
he's a businessman, alright?

10:21.829 --> 10:24.123
Now, maybe he will be
willing to negotiate.

10:29.962 --> 10:31.547
Holly, I'm sorry.
I just can't.

10:31.630 --> 10:35.092
I just..
Y'all go ahead. I just can't.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.178
Look, Val, can we at least
just meet the guy?

10:37.261 --> 10:38.596
- No!
- But why?

10:38.679 --> 10:40.681
Even if there's the teensiest,
weensiest bit of hope

10:40.765 --> 10:43.100
that we could get this place,
why won't you at least try?

10:43.184 --> 10:45.186
Will you stop? Lauren,
is he there yet?

10:45.269 --> 10:48.522
No, I'm still on hold.
Ooh, cheese!

10:48.606 --> 10:50.733
Val, it will only
take a half-hour.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.069
It'll take you a half-hour
just to clear security.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.737
Security? What are you
talking about, security?

10:54.820 --> 10:56.906
- Where is he?
- He's in prison!

10:56.989 --> 10:58.949
How fantastic is that?

10:59.033 --> 11:00.409
- He's in prison?
- Yes!

11:00.493 --> 11:02.828
I mean, this place is
just sitting here empty

11:02.912 --> 11:04.914
waiting for us to move in.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.958
You want to talk to
a guy in prison?

11:08.042 --> 11:10.336
You know, I am actually
concerned about you right now.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.046
Something is not right in here.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.757
You said for me
to go find it. I found it.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.468
You found nothing.
Holly, this isn't real.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.970
We will never have this.
Lauren, let's go.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.806
- We lost it.
- What?

11:21.889 --> 11:23.099
Some guy came in with cash.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.810
He signed the lease
five minutes ago.

11:28.687 --> 11:30.898
So I guess this one's a go!

11:32.400 --> 11:34.402
Oh, God!

11:36.362 --> 11:38.447
Lauren, put down
the cheese. Let's go.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.491
Why are people always
saying that to me?

11:40.574 --> 11:42.034
Val, please.

11:42.118 --> 11:44.870
You better hope I can still
get that stinky feet place.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.917
Sorry.

11:50.000 --> 11:52.461
Alright, let's just go.
This place is depressing me now.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.004
Oh, just give me
a couple minutes.

11:54.088 --> 11:59.301
I need to run upstairs and water
the plants around the pool.

11:59.385 --> 12:01.429
Pool?

12:09.270 --> 12:12.064
Take a couple packs
for yourself.

12:12.148 --> 12:14.233
Get yourself something nice.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.203
That's him over there.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.330
- Hey, Jay.
- Hi, Tina.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.832
So, what's up? Who's this?

12:29.915 --> 12:31.500
This is my friend Holly.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.919
'Holly here has something
she wanted to ask you.'

12:34.003 --> 12:37.673
- Oh. Ooh, Fresca.
- Over there.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.509
- Um, hello.
- Hi.

12:40.593 --> 12:42.428
Okay, Mr. Miller, um..

12:42.511 --> 12:45.514
...have you ever wanted
something so much

12:45.598 --> 12:47.683
that you would do just
about anything to get it?

12:47.766 --> 12:49.602
Yeah, I think pretty much
everyone in here

12:49.685 --> 12:51.270
has experienced that.

12:51.353 --> 12:52.730
What is it you want?

12:52.813 --> 12:56.066
Okay, you know what?
I'm just gonna lay it out there.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.777
My sister and I want
to live in your loft.

12:58.861 --> 13:00.404
No.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.114
Can I finish? Thanks.

13:02.198 --> 13:08.537
Uh, my sister and I want to
live in your loft so much!

13:08.621 --> 13:09.538
Oh..

13:09.622 --> 13:10.956
No.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.709
Okay, look, my sister is
one of the most responsible--

13:13.792 --> 13:15.794
No!

13:22.551 --> 13:24.720
Are you trying to cry?

13:24.803 --> 13:28.349
I'm just..
I'm just really sad, you know?

13:28.432 --> 13:31.936
I'm sad for the loft. I mean,
it's alone, no one's there..

13:32.019 --> 13:35.773
...and, you know, it's lonely.

13:35.856 --> 13:41.111
And my sister stopped believing
in dreams and stuff.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.656
Yeah, there aren't any tears.

13:43.739 --> 13:46.742
I was born with no tear holes.

13:46.825 --> 13:49.745
- Sorry, not buying it.
- Huh?

13:51.205 --> 13:53.415
Yeah, my-my daughter
used to pull the same

13:53.499 --> 13:55.042
fake crying bit
on me all the time.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.127
Daughter? I didn't know
you had a daughter.

13:57.211 --> 13:58.754
She's not going to
take my job, is she?

13:58.837 --> 14:00.714
No, she won't
even speak to me.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.299
I haven't heard a word from her

14:02.383 --> 14:04.969
since she refused to drive me to
Mexico in the trunk of her car.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.472
Oh, I got to go.
It's time for book club

14:08.556 --> 14:11.684
and I want to get one
of the comfy chairs.

14:11.767 --> 14:12.977
Hey, it's nice
to meet you, Holly.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.395
Tina, come see me again, okay?

14:14.478 --> 14:15.896
Jay, please, please.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.815
Oh!

14:24.613 --> 14:26.782
Anything?

14:26.865 --> 14:28.867
No, no.

14:37.084 --> 14:40.296
I can't believe someone took
the smelly feet place.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.131
Mm, well, try to look
on the bright side.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.467
Maybe tomorrow we'll find a
place that smells like armpits.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.679
Hey, do you think I was
too rough on Holly

14:48.762 --> 14:50.097
before at the loft?

14:50.180 --> 14:52.683
Are you asking me as a friend,
or as an employee?

14:52.766 --> 14:53.684
What's the difference?

14:53.767 --> 14:55.477
Well, as a friend, I would say..

14:55.561 --> 14:58.939
...shattering all her hopes
and dreams was devastating.

14:59.023 --> 15:02.276
As an employee,
I'd say I admire you..

15:02.359 --> 15:05.279
...and I'm grateful to work
for one so angelic.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.034
Come on, you saw that loft.
I mean, it's impossible.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.535
You can hope.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.662
I mean, look, the chances
of Colin Farrell

15:13.746 --> 15:15.623
jamming his tongue
in my ear are pretty slim

15:15.706 --> 15:19.209
but it's gotten me through
many a lonely night.

15:19.293 --> 15:23.547
All I'm saying is, take away
hope, and what have you got?

15:23.631 --> 15:25.007
Me.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.675
I don't want to turn
Holly into somebody

15:26.759 --> 15:28.302
who doesn't have dreams.
I mean--

15:28.385 --> 15:30.054
Whoa, whoa.
Okay, you know what?

15:30.137 --> 15:32.973
You're getting a little
too thinky and deep, and..

15:33.057 --> 15:35.267
...that is just
so not fun for me.

15:38.270 --> 15:40.272
- Hey!
- Hey.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.692
Aw, look at that.
Another sad face.

15:43.776 --> 15:46.070
I am so out of here.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.658
- So, did you get the office?
- No.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.035
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry, too..

15:53.118 --> 15:54.870
I mean, about this afternoon.

15:54.953 --> 15:57.414
You were so excited about
that loft, and I just--

15:57.498 --> 16:01.377
No, you were right.
I mean, it was stupid, anyway.

16:01.460 --> 16:03.587
No. What do you mean,
I was right?

16:03.671 --> 16:05.798
The whole thing.
It was stupid.

16:05.881 --> 16:08.676
No, don't say that, okay?
What happened?

16:08.759 --> 16:12.721
- I went to the prison.
- You went to the prison?

16:12.805 --> 16:17.726
I mean, you went to the prison
all by yourself? Oh, how brave.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.396
Tina went with me, and I talked
to the guy, and he practically

16:20.479 --> 16:23.107
laughed in my face.
You know, that's it. It's over.

16:23.190 --> 16:26.068
No, Holly, you cannot give up!
Listen to me.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.071
If people gave up every time
they ran into a little problem..

16:29.154 --> 16:32.908
...we-we wouldn't have airplanes
or spaceships or TV's..

16:32.991 --> 16:35.244
...or the peanut butter cup.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.037
- What?
- I don't know.

16:37.121 --> 16:40.165
Look, the point is, I just
don't think that you've

16:40.249 --> 16:42.584
explored every possibility.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.919
I thought you said
there was something

16:44.002 --> 16:45.504
seriously wrong in here.

16:45.587 --> 16:47.089
Oh. Why?

16:47.172 --> 16:50.426
Why do you hold on
to every word I say?

16:50.509 --> 16:51.969
Listen, sit down, okay?

16:52.052 --> 16:54.012
Now, just tell me,
what did the guy say?

16:54.096 --> 16:56.098
Well, I-I said I wanted
to live in his loft

16:56.181 --> 16:57.975
and he said "no",
like a million times.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.560
- Did you beg?
- Big time!

16:59.643 --> 17:01.270
Whine?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.772
Did you use that
whole fake cry thing?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.607
He saw right through it.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.943
I guess his daughter used
to do it all the time.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.945
- He has a daughter?
- Yeah.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.906
- What did he say about her?
- Nothing.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.284
They haven't spoken
since he got arrested.

17:15.367 --> 17:19.954
Oh, that is so sad, a father
and a daughter not talking.

17:20.038 --> 17:22.458
You know, I-I bet it would
mean the world to him

17:22.540 --> 17:26.462
if they were to talk.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.965
You know, I'll bet it would
mean the world to him.

17:30.048 --> 17:31.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah..

17:31.884 --> 17:34.803
A father, daughter,
not talking.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.264
You, me, reuniting..

17:37.347 --> 17:39.266
Father grateful,
us getting loft?

17:39.349 --> 17:40.517
Uh-huh.

17:40.601 --> 17:43.687
- Hope is alive!
- Hey!

17:43.771 --> 17:45.314
- You're back.
- What?

17:45.397 --> 17:47.608
Oh, nothing. Come on,
let's just get to work.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.109
Wait a second. Is it okay

17:49.193 --> 17:51.487
that we're getting involved
in his relationship like that?

17:51.570 --> 17:53.489
Yeah. If we are bringing
a father and daughter

17:53.572 --> 17:55.824
back together then we're really
doing something nice.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.410
And if by doing something nice,
something good happens to us--

17:58.494 --> 18:00.579
Then God bless America!

18:08.670 --> 18:09.880
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:09.963 --> 18:11.965
- How's it going?
- Oh, fine. You know.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.759
Made a broom today.
That was fun.

18:13.842 --> 18:15.219
Cool.

18:15.302 --> 18:17.179
I hope you're not here
about the loft again.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.639
Oh, no, no.

18:18.722 --> 18:21.517
I'm actually here because I want
to do something nice for you.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.768
Oh, what's that?

18:22.851 --> 18:24.853
What would you say if I told
you that your daughter

18:24.937 --> 18:26.688
was standing outside
with my sister?

18:26.772 --> 18:28.774
- Karen's out there?
- Yeah.

18:28.857 --> 18:30.400
How did you do that?
She hasn't spoken a word

18:30.484 --> 18:31.777
to me in eight months.

18:31.860 --> 18:34.029
She believed my fake cry.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.741
- You ready?
- Yeah.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.040
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.334
Here. You look great.

18:47.417 --> 18:48.502
Thanks for coming.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.337
Yeah, well, I didn't
have much choice.

18:50.420 --> 18:57.052
That blonde girl
was really intense.

18:57.135 --> 18:59.388
Did you see his face
light up when he saw her?

18:59.471 --> 19:03.892
- How good are we?
- Oh, I know.

19:03.976 --> 19:08.605
Oh, look, he touched her hand.
They are so back together.

19:08.689 --> 19:12.067
I'm so in love
with us right now.

19:12.150 --> 19:14.611
You make me puke!

19:14.695 --> 19:16.989
Oh, God, they're fighting.
What did we do?

19:17.072 --> 19:20.200
You have no idea what
you've put me through!

19:20.284 --> 19:22.411
Oh, God, this isn't good.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.414
Don't call me, don't write,
and don't send weird girls

19:25.497 --> 19:28.166
over to my apartment,
begging me to come see you.

19:28.250 --> 19:31.753
- Can I still send you money?
- Yes!

19:31.837 --> 19:34.256
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- Nothing.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.133
I told her she looked pretty..

19:36.216 --> 19:38.719
...and I asked her to take
the box from under my bed

19:38.802 --> 19:41.889
and ship it to
the Cayman Islands.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.682
She looked beautiful,
didn't she?

19:43.765 --> 19:45.100
She did.

19:45.183 --> 19:49.605
Oh, hi. I'm Val. I'm Holly's
sister. I'm so sorry.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.607
I feel terrible about--

19:51.690 --> 19:54.526
Why are you sorry? I got
to see my daughter again.

19:54.610 --> 19:56.904
- But you guys had a big fight.
- I know.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.323
That's the first time she's
talked to me in eight months.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.575
- I owe you girls big time.
- How big?

20:01.658 --> 20:05.120
No. Holly! You don't owe us
anything, Jay. Thanks.

20:05.203 --> 20:07.164
Really, well, I thought you
were interested in a loft.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.833
Oh, my God, it's happening!
Our dream has come true!

20:09.917 --> 20:12.711
Oh, my God, we will take
such good care of the loft!

20:12.794 --> 20:15.130
Oh, no, no, my loft
is out of the question.

20:15.213 --> 20:17.341
What are you doing to me?

20:17.424 --> 20:19.635
But if you're interested,
I started to renovate

20:19.718 --> 20:20.844
another loft in that building.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.638
Maybe we can work something out.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.598
Jay, it's very sweet
of you, but, really--

20:24.681 --> 20:26.433
Let's hear what the man
has to say.

20:26.516 --> 20:29.728
So, uh, this loft.
Is it like yours?

20:29.811 --> 20:31.396
It could use a little clean-up.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.565
Hey, I can make you a broom.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.027
[instrumental music]

20:42.240 --> 20:44.326
This place is incredible!

20:44.409 --> 20:45.869
Can you believe we get
all this space

20:45.953 --> 20:47.788
for what we were paying
in that little apartment?

20:47.871 --> 20:51.500
Can you believe we have
to paint all this space?

20:51.583 --> 20:54.086
- Oh, look at you all happy.
- I am happy.

20:54.169 --> 20:55.504
I thought you were insane,
but you did it.

20:55.587 --> 20:57.506
You actually found
us a great place.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.716
Then I get the master bedroom.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.593
Okay. Okay, we'll vote.

21:01.677 --> 21:03.929
I vote I get it.

21:04.012 --> 21:06.431
You know what? You put
this whole thing together.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.850
I vote you get it, too.

21:08.934 --> 21:12.604
Are you serious, Val?
Yay, thank you.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.065
You know what?
I vote you get it.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.526
I changed my vote.
I vote I get it, too.

21:25.867 --> 21:28.245
