WEBVTT

00:11.200 --> 00:12.456
And in 12 months,

00:12.456 --> 00:14.586
I guarantee I will have
this club in profit.

00:14.586 --> 00:17.088
But I come in at 20 percent.
That makes me the owner.

00:17.088 --> 00:18.240
It's Brett.

00:18.513 --> 00:19.820
He's OD'd.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.680
It sounds like
George found him

00:21.680 --> 00:23.360
on the fire escape and
had his boys toss him.

00:41.664 --> 00:44.720
My daughter.
She's with this bloke.

00:44.720 --> 00:46.320
Well, he's been bashing her.

00:46.320 --> 00:47.776
Boss has called in the favour.

00:47.776 --> 00:50.040
This chick Ash, she says
you got violent with her,

00:50.040 --> 00:51.220
You broke her jaw.

01:00.587 --> 01:03.300
So I'd take it home, bring it around the
house in the morning.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.376
Burn your clothes, everything.

01:04.376 --> 01:06.260
Shoes, socks,
undies the lot.

01:45.035 --> 01:46.202
Ezra.

01:47.488 --> 01:48.797
Wants a chat.

01:48.797 --> 01:50.033
Oh yeah?

01:52.990 --> 01:54.139
Hey.

01:59.897 --> 02:01.060
Let's have a look.

02:11.609 --> 02:12.780
Ouch!

02:13.600 --> 02:16.336
- Fucking hell.
- It's not as bad as it looks.

02:16.336 --> 02:18.206
It looks pretty fucking bad.

02:18.620 --> 02:19.790
Shit happens.

02:19.958 --> 02:21.124
Oh yeah.

02:23.060 --> 02:27.460
Well, nice to meet you, John.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.480
Did you know what you were
sending me into last night?

02:31.480 --> 02:32.797
No, I did not.

02:33.535 --> 02:34.842
That there was two of them?

02:34.842 --> 02:35.992
No!

02:36.885 --> 02:38.510
No, no.

02:40.065 --> 02:41.500
You did good though.

02:41.878 --> 02:43.497
Thanks for bringing
the car keys back.

02:43.497 --> 02:47.000
And if you leave your number
with Tony on the way out,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.900
if anything pops up,
we'll let you know.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.980
Get yourself a decent suit.

03:37.620 --> 03:38.900
Kings Cross.

03:43.587 --> 03:44.980
Kings Cross. Huh?

04:38.374 --> 04:39.500
Fuck it.

04:39.791 --> 04:42.000
Hey, you owe us, Johnny boy.

04:45.326 --> 04:46.540
Fuck it!

04:47.421 --> 04:49.740
You and your fucking brother.
You're fucking dead.

04:51.079 --> 04:54.020
I'm got to get him mopped,
mate. Fucking, this is bullshit.

04:59.501 --> 05:00.668
Demi?

05:03.494 --> 05:04.520
Where's everybody?

05:04.520 --> 05:06.960
- Why's nothing happening?
- The tradies have dropped their tools

05:06.960 --> 05:09.100
until they get reimbursed
for materials.

05:09.796 --> 05:11.200
What's the problem?
Just pay 'em.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.800
With what?

05:12.800 --> 05:15.495
Unless you've got a secret
stash you're not telling me about.

05:15.495 --> 05:16.815
Tell 'em I said
we're good for it.

05:16.815 --> 05:19.200
We're just waiting on cash flow
once we open back up.

05:19.415 --> 05:21.580
It's not how the
real world works, John.

05:21.837 --> 05:23.340
You have to pay these.

05:25.508 --> 05:29.091
Also, did you hear about this?

05:30.537 --> 05:32.371
Last night apparently.

05:32.788 --> 05:34.900
Spyro Mavris and
some other guy.

05:35.582 --> 05:37.020
You knew him, didn't you?

05:38.432 --> 05:40.474
Yeah. Yeah, a little.

05:41.399 --> 05:42.483
Jesus.

05:59.813 --> 06:00.914
What's going on, John?

06:01.505 --> 06:03.940
Now's not a good time, Sam.
I'm on the phone.

06:06.263 --> 06:07.573
What happened to your face?

06:08.300 --> 06:10.400
Oh, it was nothing.
Just got into a scrap.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.020
Come on man. Dad told me.

06:13.593 --> 06:14.815
Dad told you what?

06:14.815 --> 06:16.740
He saw you last night
in the backyard.

06:17.176 --> 06:20.260
I don't know what
you're talking about, Sam.

06:20.929 --> 06:22.400
Oh, don't fuck around, John.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.856
Don't worry about it.
It was nothing.

06:23.856 --> 06:25.840
Nothing? You burned your
clothes in the backyard.

06:25.840 --> 06:27.220
You think I'm a
fucking idiot.

06:29.164 --> 06:31.020
Demi, would you fuck off.

06:38.488 --> 06:40.460
I don't have time
for this shit, okay!

06:41.482 --> 06:42.489
Listen to me.

06:42.719 --> 06:44.740
If you don't tell me
I can't help you.

06:47.676 --> 06:48.820
Who was it?

06:53.007 --> 06:56.091
Spyro Mavris, and his mate.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.180
You did 'em both.

07:00.646 --> 07:02.020
Big Tony was there.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.460
Next time you need help,
John. You call me.

07:17.587 --> 07:19.296
I had no choice.

07:23.068 --> 07:25.340
Hey!
Hey! Hey!

07:37.504 --> 07:38.660
Listen to me.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.660
You need to go back out there.

07:42.120 --> 07:44.460
You're going to act like
everything's fucking beautiful.

07:44.963 --> 07:46.060
Right?

07:48.326 --> 07:49.408
Hey?

07:50.695 --> 07:51.980
Snap out of it.

07:56.893 --> 07:58.060
Here take this.

07:58.212 --> 08:00.540
- No, I don't want...
- Just fucking take it.

08:17.940 --> 08:19.600
Can I talk to you a minute?

08:20.524 --> 08:21.740
Yeah, yeah.

08:23.050 --> 08:24.180
Sammy.

08:24.595 --> 08:26.100
He's looking happy.

08:33.670 --> 08:35.020
I spoke to John.

08:38.415 --> 08:41.522
Listen, Tony, if there's
anything you need.

08:41.522 --> 08:42.584
You come direct to me.

08:42.584 --> 08:44.624
I'll sort it out.
No questions asked.

08:45.253 --> 08:46.752
He's just a kid.

08:48.754 --> 08:50.100
Not anymore he's not.

08:50.588 --> 08:51.897
Whose fault is that?

08:52.684 --> 08:56.700
Listen, all I can tell you
is that Ezra's taken a shine.

08:57.787 --> 08:58.971
Really?

08:59.540 --> 09:01.860
You can tell Ezra that
I've taken a shine to him.

09:04.254 --> 09:05.580
I'm not going to
tell him that.

09:06.088 --> 09:07.380
Well I'll tell you, then.

09:08.900 --> 09:11.220
There's nothing I won't
do to protect my brother.

09:14.340 --> 09:18.064
You know, Sam, I got a lot
of respect for you. A lot.

09:18.540 --> 09:22.540
Out of respect, I'm going to
forget you just said that.

09:30.193 --> 09:32.105
Besides, you won't have
to look out for John

09:32.105 --> 09:33.420
for too much longer.

09:35.260 --> 09:36.940
Pretty soon,
you'll be working for him.

10:05.420 --> 10:07.100
Fat George is still sulking.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.764
I'd be sulking too,
if I looked like him.

10:09.764 --> 10:12.556
Mate, throwing him in a
dumpster's a bit much, isn't it?

10:12.556 --> 10:13.765
Tell it to Brett.

10:14.060 --> 10:15.220
Brett was dead.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.740
Exactly.

10:19.895 --> 10:21.475
You watch your back.
All right?

10:22.060 --> 10:25.580
Alright ladies,
I'm going all in.

10:26.819 --> 10:28.536
Fast game's a good game.

10:28.536 --> 10:31.056
- All right sweetheart?
- It is if you win.

10:31.056 --> 10:33.564
Fast game
it shall be.

10:33.564 --> 10:35.300
Righto, soft cock,
what you got?

10:36.460 --> 10:38.740
Oh, he's got
no cajones.

10:40.448 --> 10:42.276
Aw. Too sad.

10:42.276 --> 10:43.860
- Hey pretty boy.
- Hmm?

10:45.980 --> 10:49.143
I got three queens,
says you got to take a shit

10:49.143 --> 10:50.380
or get off the pot.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.740
Ladies and gentlemen,
here it is.

11:08.518 --> 11:12.518
Boom, boom, boom.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.272
That's how you do it, darling.

11:16.272 --> 11:17.616
Watch and learn.

11:17.616 --> 11:19.840
I'm watching, sir.
Believe me.

11:23.086 --> 11:24.940
And
this is all mine.

11:24.940 --> 11:28.506
Oh, cheer up son.

11:43.780 --> 11:46.056
Joey Romano maintains
he's already paid.

11:46.056 --> 11:48.176
Bullshit! Half paid, okay.

11:48.176 --> 11:50.896
Complaining that his new
shop is costing too much.

11:50.896 --> 11:52.976
Why he need shop? Huh?

11:52.976 --> 11:55.157
Whoever heard of pot dealer
needing shop.

11:55.157 --> 11:56.660
Maybe he's branching out.

11:57.076 --> 11:58.428
How branching out?

11:58.559 --> 11:59.701
I don't know.

12:00.116 --> 12:02.656
I saw him talking with Big Tony
while I was doing the rounds.

12:02.656 --> 12:05.380
Why is Big Tony talking
to shit like him?

12:05.838 --> 12:07.260
This I don't like.

12:09.088 --> 12:11.633
Okay, two envelope missing.

12:11.633 --> 12:13.500
You and Stripperama.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.077
I already told you, Nasa,

12:16.077 --> 12:18.100
I'm not paying for what
I'm not using.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.080
You can't expect me and
Sam to lean on my own joint.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.620
It makes no sense.

12:27.185 --> 12:28.460
And Stripperama?

12:31.340 --> 12:35.600
I tell you this, Fat George
is always behind on his rent.

12:35.600 --> 12:36.780
Big money.

12:37.304 --> 12:39.100
It's a fact, forever now.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.056
He knows that the owner
will not cancel his lease

12:42.056 --> 12:44.096
because he's worried that
he will not get money

12:44.096 --> 12:45.360
that he is owed.

12:46.020 --> 12:48.500
Maybe, maybe not.
This is not my problem.

12:49.380 --> 12:52.860
But never is he late
in his payment to me.

12:54.279 --> 12:55.380
I get that.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.580
Just Sam told me to steer clear
'cause of what went down.

12:59.162 --> 13:00.816
Johnny, you listen to me.

13:00.816 --> 13:03.510
To stay alive in the jungle
you must show the other animals

13:03.510 --> 13:06.400
that you are not scared,
even when you are.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.740
I'm not scared.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.300
Then where the fuck
is my envelope? Hmm?

13:46.416 --> 13:49.720
Oh you like that?
Huh?

13:49.720 --> 13:51.420
Please. Please stop!

13:54.620 --> 13:56.736
Righto, George,
out you pop.

13:56.736 --> 13:58.056
Girls only in here.
You know that.

13:58.056 --> 13:59.531
What sort of bullshit is this?

13:59.531 --> 14:01.680
- This is my joint.
- Unless it's the green room, darling,

14:01.680 --> 14:03.064
which is my joint.

14:03.064 --> 14:04.160
Out you go.

14:21.199 --> 14:23.460
You all right, love?
Did he hurt you?

14:24.090 --> 14:25.780
He said it was part
of the job.

14:26.537 --> 14:27.912
Well, it's not.

14:31.196 --> 14:33.460
You work for him,
not under him.

14:36.103 --> 14:37.376
Tell you what.

14:37.376 --> 14:40.740
Next time he tries it
on you, you come to me,

14:41.171 --> 14:43.660
and I will chop his balls off.

14:45.493 --> 14:49.094
- If anyone can find 'em.
- No one's
seen 'em for years, fat fuck.

14:58.020 --> 15:00.416
You've got a fucking hide
coming in here.

15:00.416 --> 15:01.540
What do you want?

15:01.920 --> 15:04.376
- It's Thursday.
- Thursday, huh?

15:04.376 --> 15:06.420
Thursday for everyone,
for you too?

15:07.009 --> 15:08.140
Huh?

15:08.760 --> 15:11.500
Ah, Thursday collection for
everyone, but not for you?

15:12.000 --> 15:14.439
You think you're too good
to pay like the rest of us?

15:14.837 --> 15:16.220
You got the money or not?

15:16.617 --> 15:18.696
Answer the question, huh?

15:18.696 --> 15:20.856
How come you don't pay
protection on your club?

15:20.856 --> 15:21.896
None of your fucking business.

15:21.896 --> 15:23.618
It is my business.

15:23.618 --> 15:27.420
You know, I pay, Frank pays,
we all pay, but you don't.

15:27.686 --> 15:29.020
You think you're special.

15:29.421 --> 15:31.426
I don't need protection
in my own joint.

15:32.776 --> 15:34.580
So, that's how it works now, huh?

15:34.904 --> 15:37.016
And maybe I don't
need Nasa now either.

15:37.016 --> 15:38.480
How does that sound?

15:38.480 --> 15:39.540
Fine.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.776
I tell Nasa,
and Nasa tells Ezra,

15:41.776 --> 15:43.336
Ezra gives me the
green light to come back

15:43.336 --> 15:45.100
and bash your fat ass again.

15:46.560 --> 15:48.280
I could use some cheering up.

15:48.464 --> 15:49.482
Do it!

15:49.918 --> 15:51.140
I dare ya.

15:52.260 --> 15:54.230
You're a fucking nobody!

15:54.466 --> 15:56.280
From some shit suburb.

15:56.809 --> 15:58.700
Grew up on welfare.

16:11.160 --> 16:13.220
And you just paid me, dickhead.

16:14.259 --> 16:16.220
How's that feel, hmm?

16:26.160 --> 16:28.397
- Are you circumcised?
- Nah.

16:28.397 --> 16:29.896
- Are you?
- No.

16:30.770 --> 16:32.140
What do you reckon, John?

16:32.723 --> 16:35.182
- About what?
- About being circumcised?

16:36.140 --> 16:38.565
I think it's crazy you're
cutting bits off, JT.

16:38.565 --> 16:40.136
You need all the
help you can get.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.296
Plus, I don't know
about you boys,

16:45.296 --> 16:46.900
but I do a lot of drive-bys.

16:47.133 --> 16:50.647
What if I'm ever in a
dick lineup, want a disguise.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.296
Plus, it makes
it look dangerous.

16:52.296 --> 16:53.896
- Dangerous.
- Fucking dangerous.

16:53.896 --> 16:56.296
Hey! You guys want to stop
talking about your dicks

16:56.296 --> 16:57.480
and take care of that?

17:01.637 --> 17:03.220
Not you, Dangerous.

17:13.060 --> 17:15.936
You boys finished doing
the rounds at Parramatta?

17:15.936 --> 17:18.900
Yeah, there was some nonsense
at the Triple 8 Club.

17:19.463 --> 17:21.900
Grant was having some issues
but we sorted them out.

17:23.086 --> 17:24.620
So you did your job?

17:26.920 --> 17:28.100
Did my job.

17:29.861 --> 17:32.060
I'll follow up,
make sure it sticks.

17:45.540 --> 17:47.840
Hey, Molly, Molly!
You are burning them.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.056
- The key is to get in quick.
- Mm-hmm.

17:51.056 --> 17:52.300
And flip quicker.

17:52.768 --> 17:54.620
- Perfect.
- Mm-hmm.

17:55.876 --> 17:56.918
Okay.

17:58.124 --> 18:00.189
Molly,
you've got a visitor.

18:00.189 --> 18:01.300
Um.

18:09.300 --> 18:12.879
Hey, look, I'm kind
of flat out right now.

18:14.712 --> 18:15.740
Okay.

18:16.064 --> 18:17.883
This won't take long,
I just, um,

18:18.600 --> 18:20.380
wanted to say sorry
for last night.

18:21.463 --> 18:22.660
It was...

18:23.993 --> 18:26.256
It sounds kind of stupid,
there was a fight at the club.

18:26.256 --> 18:28.136
There shouldn't be, but,
you know, I couldn't.

18:28.136 --> 18:30.100
They don't have phones
at the club?

18:33.529 --> 18:35.154
Has something happened?

18:40.660 --> 18:42.660
You weren't with someone else?

18:43.720 --> 18:44.780
No!

18:45.227 --> 18:47.472
No, no, no, never!

18:47.742 --> 18:49.340
Then what is it?

18:51.546 --> 18:52.860
Are you okay?

18:56.040 --> 18:58.780
Come on, John,
just talk to me.

18:59.160 --> 19:01.460
Please, it's going to
make you feel better.

19:05.600 --> 19:07.896
- I should go.
- What!

19:07.896 --> 19:09.060
Come here!

19:09.545 --> 19:10.700
Hey!

19:13.480 --> 19:16.056
Are you serious, your break's
not for another hour.

19:16.056 --> 19:18.016
- Just give me one sec.
- Excuse me?

19:18.016 --> 19:20.045
- Mate, just leave us alone.
- No, look, you can socialise

19:20.045 --> 19:21.176
all you
like in your own time,

19:21.176 --> 19:22.397
but right now you better
get your butt back in...

19:22.397 --> 19:23.720
Would you fuck off!

19:40.046 --> 19:41.700
Oh, shit, I'm...

19:53.260 --> 19:55.416
Paul,
so good to see you.

19:55.416 --> 19:56.576
Absolutely.

19:56.576 --> 19:58.896
And you must be our new
Assistant Commissioner.

19:58.896 --> 20:01.376
- Paul!
- Bill Allen, pleasure to meet you.

20:01.376 --> 20:02.921
Nice to meet you.

20:05.154 --> 20:06.440
And you are?

20:06.600 --> 20:08.656
Oh, honey, this is Bill Allen.

20:08.656 --> 20:10.482
- Ah, how do you do?
- Very good.

20:10.482 --> 20:13.460
All right, you met the missus
then I see.

20:13.800 --> 20:16.016
It's a lovely spread you
have here, Mrs. Shipman.

20:16.016 --> 20:17.616
Oh, Yael, please.

20:17.616 --> 20:19.696
Come, why don't I give
you the grand tour?

20:19.696 --> 20:21.900
Yeah, go on, go on, mate.

20:22.723 --> 20:24.000
Keep your head down,
if I was you,

20:24.000 --> 20:25.339
she's pretty handy
with a carving knife.

20:25.339 --> 20:27.340
- Aha!
- Aha!

20:28.052 --> 20:29.580
My condolences.

20:33.288 --> 20:34.660
Seriously, I...

20:35.598 --> 20:37.307
I come home last night
and my daughter

20:37.307 --> 20:39.434
is in an absolute state.

20:39.723 --> 20:42.200
God's sake, I asked you
to warn him,

20:42.200 --> 20:43.340
not kill him.

20:43.530 --> 20:48.620
Well, yeah, it got the
job done though, didn't it?

20:51.861 --> 20:54.440
- Hi.
- Hey, what can I get for you?

20:54.440 --> 20:56.620
Nothing.
Yeah, I was just after.

20:57.184 --> 20:58.660
Is Mrs. Mavris here?

20:59.890 --> 21:02.100
Yeah, why, what do you
want her for?

21:02.647 --> 21:03.700
Who are you?

21:04.497 --> 21:05.880
Oh, I'm a...

21:06.854 --> 21:08.016
A friend of her son's.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.700
Just, I wanted to talk to her.

21:12.546 --> 21:13.560
Mama!

21:13.688 --> 21:14.740
Yeah?

21:26.197 --> 21:28.500
She's just making loukoumades.

21:36.063 --> 21:38.020
Mrs. Mavris, hi.

21:39.442 --> 21:42.979
I heard about what happened.
I just wanted to say how sorry I am.

21:47.660 --> 21:49.220
You're a friend of Spyro's?

21:50.298 --> 21:51.441
Yeah.

21:51.932 --> 21:54.340
I didn't think
he had any mates.

21:55.520 --> 21:59.500
Oh no, no,
he was really popular.

22:00.119 --> 22:05.256
His mates and I, we chipped
in just for funeral costs,

22:05.256 --> 22:07.580
and whatever else.

22:11.520 --> 22:13.380
Jeez, how many mates
did he have?

22:17.509 --> 22:18.700
What's your name?

22:20.612 --> 22:21.780
John.

22:25.313 --> 22:26.360
Thank you.

22:26.360 --> 22:27.510
Yeah.

22:29.426 --> 22:30.500
Really sorry.

22:44.220 --> 22:45.420
Champagne?

22:45.604 --> 22:46.771
Paul?

22:48.980 --> 22:50.289
Would you give us a minute?

22:50.860 --> 22:53.500
Oh, why don't you help me
get the lamb on.

22:55.200 --> 22:56.380
- Sure.
- Let's go.

22:57.813 --> 22:58.940
Thanks, darling!

23:05.729 --> 23:07.455
So, commiserations.

23:07.854 --> 23:11.420
Oh, no need, Terry Fields
was a prick.

23:11.760 --> 23:13.860
Yeah, but he was a useful
prick though, weren't he?

23:15.400 --> 23:16.900
Not sure I know what you mean.

23:18.580 --> 23:19.780
Yeah, you do.

23:23.020 --> 23:24.740
Times have changed, Ezra.

23:25.860 --> 23:28.576
There's too many do-gooders
carrying on about people like me

23:28.576 --> 23:31.540
hanging out with
people like you.

23:32.340 --> 23:34.740
The upside doesn't
warrant the risk anymore.

23:36.241 --> 23:38.380
That depends on the upside,
don't it?

23:40.860 --> 23:42.740
I've got a game
changer coming up.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.260
What kind of game changer?

23:47.096 --> 23:48.660
Who am I talking to here?

23:50.590 --> 23:52.980
I'll need twice
as much as Terry got.

23:55.020 --> 23:56.020
There you go.

23:57.276 --> 23:58.580
I knew we'd get along.

24:31.146 --> 24:32.372
What are you doing here?

24:32.372 --> 24:33.440
What do you mean?

24:33.848 --> 24:34.940
I work here.

24:35.431 --> 24:36.441
Since when?

24:36.441 --> 24:39.079
Well, since Sam wants someone
on the crew he could trust.

24:39.079 --> 24:41.300
And when no one else was
available, he called me.

24:41.642 --> 24:43.961
I'm here to watch your
back, and your front.

24:44.740 --> 24:46.360
You keep that front
of yours in your pants.

24:46.360 --> 24:47.560
I'll do my best.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.860
Good suit, dickhead.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.777
Hi, everyone!

24:57.777 --> 25:00.736
Some of you have probably seen me
hanging around here the last few weeks,

25:00.736 --> 25:03.140
trying to figure out how to
run this joint a bit better.

25:04.060 --> 25:05.620
I got a couple of ideas.

25:06.860 --> 25:10.860
First up, as of right now,
this club is high-end,

25:11.136 --> 25:14.247
upmarket, exclusive.

25:14.980 --> 25:17.040
Rich kids, they want a
night out on the wild side,

25:17.040 --> 25:18.861
but they also
want to feel safe.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.496
So if you see anyone
looking as big and mean

25:21.496 --> 25:24.016
as that guy over there trying
to get in,

25:24.016 --> 25:25.740
- not going to happen.
- Not tonight.

25:31.980 --> 25:33.860
We're also going to
cut out the stealing.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.020
Nah, it's cool, I get it.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.696
Previous management
was dumb enough

25:38.696 --> 25:41.860
to let you get away with it
then you'd be dumb not to.

25:43.108 --> 25:46.260
Management is not dumb anymore,

25:47.520 --> 25:48.900
so that's finished.

25:49.760 --> 25:50.936
I also know some of the staff

25:50.936 --> 25:53.140
have been using this
club to deal drugs.

25:54.580 --> 25:56.936
See, anybody dealing
drugs in this club

25:56.936 --> 25:59.140
threatens the club's licence.

25:59.720 --> 26:04.380
And if you do that, it'll cost
you more than it'll cost me.

26:05.011 --> 26:06.657
It'll cost me everything.

26:07.077 --> 26:09.220
Are we clear on
what I'm saying?

26:11.337 --> 26:12.380
Good.

26:12.575 --> 26:14.740
Well then, go have fun,

26:15.120 --> 26:17.980
show these kids the best
night of their lives.

26:19.390 --> 26:21.260
Off you go, go work!

26:26.063 --> 26:27.700
Congratulations!

26:37.440 --> 26:40.997
We go and get our money
and then I want to go and eat.

26:40.997 --> 26:43.982
- There they are!
- Come to see what all
the fuss is about, boys?

26:43.982 --> 26:45.016
Payday, Joey.

26:45.016 --> 26:47.020
Yeah, I'm all over it.

26:47.020 --> 26:48.120
Huh?

26:48.508 --> 26:49.920
Before you ask,
it's a little light.

26:49.920 --> 26:51.024
Again?

26:51.024 --> 26:52.289
This is three weeks
now you are late.

26:52.289 --> 26:53.316
Mate, the fit out
on this place

26:53.316 --> 26:54.580
cost me a fucking
arm and a leg.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.096
Yeah, this my fault?

26:56.096 --> 26:57.214
I ask for you to open shop?

26:57.214 --> 26:59.280
Nasa, fucking relax, will ya!

26:59.280 --> 27:00.940
It's not like
I'm going anywhere.

27:01.729 --> 27:03.111
Can we sort this out
next week?

27:03.111 --> 27:04.976
I hope this thing
makes money, Joey.

27:04.976 --> 27:06.620
It's going to make
a fucking mint, mate.

27:06.878 --> 27:09.720
You're fucking joking, aren't
ya, Pac-Man and Gallagher?

27:09.919 --> 27:10.993
It's Galaga.

27:10.993 --> 27:13.520
I don't give a fuck if
it's goo-goo-gaga, you pay!

27:13.520 --> 27:15.880
Yeah, all right, I'll pay you in
twenty-cent pieces, how's that?

27:16.320 --> 27:18.336
Next week you pay
me everything you owe.

27:18.336 --> 27:21.100
This shop,
I give it one month.

27:22.284 --> 27:25.056
I'm fucking kidding,
what's his fucking problem?

27:25.056 --> 27:28.260
He's got a point, Joey. This
is the Cross not Luna Park.

27:28.804 --> 27:29.862
No shit.

27:30.328 --> 27:31.330
Let me show you something.

27:31.330 --> 27:33.800
Have a look, Frogger, right?

27:33.800 --> 27:34.925
Another Frogger.

27:40.404 --> 27:41.523
You ready?

27:41.523 --> 27:44.100
Take the cash, in the hole.

27:45.566 --> 27:46.616
Down.

27:46.616 --> 27:47.830
Fucking kneel down, will you?

27:47.830 --> 27:49.622
For fuck's sake, Joey!

27:54.146 --> 27:55.300
Blow?

27:58.897 --> 28:00.020
Coke, yeah.

28:00.217 --> 28:01.380
How's that?

28:01.896 --> 28:03.686
Genius, right?

28:03.686 --> 28:04.800
Huh?

28:05.466 --> 28:07.512
Cannot hold back progress, brother.

28:08.340 --> 28:09.996
I got to tell Nasa, yeah?

28:09.996 --> 28:11.747
Yeah, well, I mean, he's
going to notice a river of money

28:11.747 --> 28:14.280
flowing down Darlinghurst
Road at some point, yeah?

28:15.000 --> 28:16.660
You want in,
you just say the word.

28:17.063 --> 28:18.300
I'm good.

28:19.580 --> 28:22.520
You're good, for how long?

28:23.520 --> 28:26.080
Mate, this is going to
go ballistic, right?

28:26.080 --> 28:28.549
And not everybody's going
to be a happy camper.

28:29.688 --> 28:31.080
People fear you.

28:32.208 --> 28:33.740
That's worth a lot to me.

28:34.912 --> 28:36.420
This is the future, mate.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.260
Hey, you heard of Donkey Kong?

28:40.938 --> 28:42.060
Come with me.

29:24.108 --> 29:26.620
This club is amazing!

29:34.771 --> 29:36.061
Whoa, whoa, boys!

29:36.061 --> 29:37.220
Come on now.

29:37.655 --> 29:38.672
What?

29:39.020 --> 29:40.600
Not tonight, sunshine.

29:40.771 --> 29:41.780
Sunshine?

29:42.371 --> 29:43.660
Fucking like that.

29:44.620 --> 29:45.996
How come we can't come in?

29:45.996 --> 29:47.260
Oh, come on, man.

29:47.513 --> 29:49.997
Hey, go home, have a shower
and try again later, eh?

29:50.240 --> 29:51.247
Maybe have a shave.

29:51.820 --> 29:54.420
What, you got a problem
with the way we look?

29:54.800 --> 29:56.860
Nah, it's just a different
vibe tonight, man.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.996
There's a few other joints
up on the strip though.

30:02.755 --> 30:04.780
We need you on
the door right now.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.300
- You okay?
- Yeah, of course.

30:09.562 --> 30:10.620
I'll be back.

30:16.438 --> 30:17.600
Hey, what's going on?

30:17.600 --> 30:18.776
Oh, I was just
letting these boys know

30:18.776 --> 30:20.376
it's not really
their crowd tonight.

30:20.376 --> 30:22.616
I was telling Blondie
here I don't give a fuck.

30:22.616 --> 30:25.616
Okay, all right, just
take a step back, relax.

30:25.616 --> 30:27.620
This fuckwit wants
to bridge up, eh?

30:28.100 --> 30:29.871
Oh, fuck, look who
grew a pair of balls

30:29.871 --> 30:32.200
- hiding behind their boyfriend.
- Hey fuck him! I can handle this.

30:32.200 --> 30:33.260
Hey, Dave,

30:34.531 --> 30:35.696
I've got this.

30:37.576 --> 30:40.860
See, the boss has got a strict
no-clown policy here, that's all.

30:42.840 --> 30:44.620
Do you know
who the fuck we are?

30:46.800 --> 30:48.500
Do you know who I think I am?

30:49.955 --> 30:51.705
You're fucking funny,
are you?

30:52.124 --> 30:53.176
Oh!

30:53.176 --> 30:54.976
Huh,
you find that funny, huh?

30:54.976 --> 30:56.415
Did you see that,
he just hit him in the face.

30:56.415 --> 30:59.176
You're fucking dead!
You're dead, sunshine.

30:59.176 --> 31:01.540
- Come on.
- Fellas, what's the problem?

31:01.920 --> 31:06.060
CBD Licensing Squad.
We're shutting you down, sport.

31:06.680 --> 31:07.736
Ah, for what?

31:07.736 --> 31:10.336
Affray, disorderly conduct,
you can't have violence

31:10.336 --> 31:12.318
like that outside
a licensed premises.

31:12.318 --> 31:14.216
Oh no, this, this
is a misunderstanding.

31:14.216 --> 31:15.456
Hey listen,
why don't you boys come in,

31:15.456 --> 31:17.160
Demi will look after you,
she'll get you some drinks,

31:17.160 --> 31:18.500
it'll be fine, huh?

31:18.500 --> 31:20.176
Uh, hey, hey, hey, hey!

31:20.176 --> 31:21.705
Do you want to go for
bribery as well, mate?

31:21.705 --> 31:23.400
No, Dave, Dave,
Dave, Dave... Just don't.

31:23.400 --> 31:25.660
Make my job easier, please.

31:27.729 --> 31:31.104
Yep, okay, okay, we're good.

31:32.720 --> 31:34.376
All right, boys, shut it down.

31:34.376 --> 31:36.620
Go home, folks, go home.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.660
Hey, what is going on?

31:42.660 --> 31:44.011
Sorry about all this.

31:44.011 --> 31:45.580
John, who are you calling?

31:45.580 --> 31:46.616
Just a friend.

31:46.616 --> 31:49.374
Out the front please,
come with me now.

31:49.374 --> 31:51.260
Yes, it's John Ibrahim,
we got a problem.

31:52.180 --> 31:53.539
Yeah, I can hold,
but it's urg...

31:53.539 --> 31:55.872
Let's go.

31:56.300 --> 31:58.198
Hey, I can drive you home, if
you just stick around for a bit.

31:58.198 --> 31:59.747
John, I can get a cab.

31:59.747 --> 32:01.080
No, no, no,
I want to, Moll, please.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.914
Hey, you have stuff you
need to organise here,

32:02.914 --> 32:04.096
I'm going to get
out of your hair.

32:04.096 --> 32:05.976
Just, hey, let me pay
for the cab at least.

32:05.976 --> 32:07.491
- Don't be silly.
- No, I'm not being silly.

32:07.491 --> 32:09.956
Please, just get home safe.

32:09.956 --> 32:11.020
Okay.

32:11.942 --> 32:13.716
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

32:22.849 --> 32:24.291
Fucking
behave yourselves.

32:24.291 --> 32:25.820
Sure,
Officer Crellan.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.736
Who the fuck are
you? -Oh, Detective.

32:32.736 --> 32:34.039
No, don't tell me,
because I don't give a shit

32:34.039 --> 32:35.330
because a more
important question

32:35.330 --> 32:36.997
is do you know who I am?

32:36.997 --> 32:38.996
Yeah, of course.

32:38.996 --> 32:40.896
Right, so if you know who I am,

32:40.896 --> 32:43.856
then what the fuck are
you doing in my world?

32:43.856 --> 32:45.296
Well, we had a report
of an affray

32:45.296 --> 32:46.766
outside of a
licensed premises,

32:46.766 --> 32:47.840
so we happened
to be in the area.

32:47.840 --> 32:49.165
Oh, yeah, did you?
Okay, so listen,

32:49.165 --> 32:50.658
I'm going to ask this once

32:50.658 --> 32:52.640
and so don't bullshit me.

32:53.020 --> 32:54.656
Who's shouting the drink?

33:00.697 --> 33:02.736
I ever see you
on my patch again

33:02.736 --> 33:04.880
and you'll be handing out
parking tickets in Wagga,

33:04.880 --> 33:06.060
you understand me?

33:06.360 --> 33:08.260
- Yeah.
- Now fuck off.

33:08.940 --> 33:11.247
All right, boys,
pack it up, we're done here.

33:11.431 --> 33:12.540
Thanks for that.

33:12.540 --> 33:16.100
This is what happens when you
put a bloke in a dumpster.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.664
You say Fat George,
I see a dumpster.

33:18.664 --> 33:20.296
Yeah, well,
can I make a suggestion?

33:20.296 --> 33:22.080
Maybe you pull
your fucking head in

33:22.080 --> 33:23.740
before you piss Ezra off.

33:26.020 --> 33:27.060
Fair enough.

33:27.640 --> 33:29.416
You want to come inside,
I'll sort you out?

33:29.416 --> 33:31.140
Oh, no, this one's on me.

33:32.091 --> 33:33.220
And the other thing?

33:33.920 --> 33:35.200
There is no other thing.

33:40.633 --> 33:42.260
See you later,
Officer Crellan.

33:58.360 --> 34:01.156
All right? Hmm?

35:42.520 --> 35:43.880
This is what you want, Johnny?

35:44.520 --> 35:45.800
Is it what they want?

35:46.168 --> 35:47.640
I mean, looks like it.

35:48.257 --> 35:49.500
Then it's what I want.

35:50.501 --> 35:51.602
Good job.

36:15.938 --> 36:17.180
Are you the new owner?

36:18.840 --> 36:19.920
Part-owner.

36:20.107 --> 36:22.936
Tony Caruso, good to meet you.

36:22.936 --> 36:24.016
John Ibrahim.

36:24.640 --> 36:29.234
Love the fit out, it's very
Berlin-Ibiza something.

36:29.234 --> 36:30.376
It's unreal.

36:30.376 --> 36:31.856
You in the nightclub business?

36:31.856 --> 36:35.816
Yeah, I wish,
I'm a mortgage broker,

36:35.816 --> 36:38.165
mostly work in high-end
real estate.

36:39.011 --> 36:42.280
You know, if you're looking
for a pad to match this place,

36:43.651 --> 36:46.300
you give me a call,
I'll look after you.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.656
Might be a while, I just
bought into this place.

36:48.656 --> 36:51.578
Who cares? Owner of the hottest
nightclub in the Cross.

36:51.578 --> 36:52.680
Part-owner.

36:53.317 --> 36:56.136
Same-same as far as
the bank's concerned.

36:56.136 --> 36:58.780
You know, it doesn't matter
how much you're worth,

36:59.438 --> 37:02.220
it's how much they think
you're worth, remember that.

37:02.561 --> 37:03.820
It's good to know.

37:04.353 --> 37:05.460
John.

37:06.542 --> 37:07.900
Have a good night, Tony.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.216
You're not going
to believe this,

37:11.216 --> 37:13.060
but your bikey friends
are back.

37:13.612 --> 37:15.656
Jesus, is it the
same two blokes?

37:15.656 --> 37:16.840
Not exactly.

37:23.729 --> 37:25.160
I wanted to meet him.

37:26.452 --> 37:28.300
- Hm.
- Shit.

37:35.597 --> 37:36.740
Come on.

37:38.112 --> 37:40.020
I told you to buy him flowers.

37:40.510 --> 37:42.340
- Carrying?
- Yeah.

37:42.671 --> 37:44.760
Give it to Demi, otherwise
you'll fucking use it.

37:44.760 --> 37:46.136
We'll cop a fucking hiding.

37:46.136 --> 37:47.996
Yeah, we'll cop
a hiding together.

37:47.996 --> 37:49.176
Um, should I call the cops?

37:49.176 --> 37:51.860
No, put the light on
and get Sam, go.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.456
All right folks, good news for
you, no cover charge tonight,

37:54.456 --> 37:57.256
tonight's on me, go through.
- What about those guys?

37:57.256 --> 37:58.960
Don't worry, hun,
they're not coming in.

37:58.960 --> 37:59.996
Enjoy your night.

37:59.996 --> 38:01.800
- Have a good night.
- Thanks.

38:03.283 --> 38:05.380
Hey, Dave, let's go!

38:06.000 --> 38:08.020
Whenever you're ready,
dickhead!

38:08.200 --> 38:10.380
Give us a moment,
it's a new jacket.

38:12.880 --> 38:15.539
I see you brought the rest of
your clown college here tonight.

38:15.539 --> 38:18.416
Yeah, what the fuck's
your problem, eh?

38:18.416 --> 38:19.705
You're not right in the head.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.496
Probably not, but if
you think I'm messed up,

38:22.496 --> 38:24.580
you wait until you see
my fucking brother.

39:15.753 --> 39:18.940
- John!
- I'm good, I'm good.

39:33.640 --> 39:34.706
Piss off!

39:35.890 --> 39:37.100
Piss off!

39:54.563 --> 39:55.940
Get fucked!

40:10.240 --> 40:12.340
Oh, look at you.

40:14.741 --> 40:15.860
Sam.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.816
How are you meant
to stay handsome,

40:19.816 --> 40:22.740
if you keep doing
this shit, hm?

40:25.200 --> 40:26.456
How's this?

40:27.316 --> 40:28.800
We need to get you
back in the gym, mate.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.020
Hey, fuck you.

40:35.000 --> 40:36.980
I saw you with
this guy up here...

40:38.669 --> 40:41.900
Hey, do you know what's
good for bruising?

40:44.630 --> 40:45.780
Rooting.

41:02.534 --> 41:03.740
I'm sorry.

41:04.202 --> 41:06.856
- I am very sorry.
- Hey, spin.

41:06.856 --> 41:08.580
Don't slip on your pearls, darling,

41:08.580 --> 41:10.205
cash them in.

41:10.205 --> 41:12.620
- May I?
- Good evening, please.

41:13.146 --> 41:15.300
You most certainly may.

41:18.500 --> 41:20.396
Do we know each other, darling?

41:21.801 --> 41:23.220
We do now.

41:23.847 --> 41:25.928
My luck's getting
better and better.

Call.

Here comes the 10.

43:10.642 --> 43:11.780
Seven.

43:16.139 --> 43:17.580
And then there were two.

43:18.490 --> 43:19.660
I check.

43:22.100 --> 43:24.619
You're starting to sweat
there a little bit, love.

43:24.619 --> 43:27.416
I'm Vietnamese,
we don't sweat.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.780
I'm calling your all-in.

43:48.645 --> 43:51.746
If you insist, I call.

43:58.800 --> 44:00.540
Here comes
three more.

44:01.803 --> 44:03.300
Check, show them.

44:17.781 --> 44:18.924
Ta da.

44:19.093 --> 44:21.426
Sevens, full house.

44:58.703 --> 44:59.980
Well done.

45:01.920 --> 45:03.180
Thank you for that.

45:17.539 --> 45:18.872
Fucking bikies.

45:19.560 --> 45:21.200
I've got no problem
with the Black Flag boys,

45:21.200 --> 45:22.518
they love to fight.

45:22.518 --> 45:24.720
If someone's going to pay them for a wash,
I don't give a fuck.

45:24.720 --> 45:26.637
I know, I get it.

45:28.831 --> 45:31.280
It's that fat fuck George
you've got to worry about.

45:31.813 --> 45:33.816
Already did, dumpster.

45:33.816 --> 45:36.060
Could you stop
eating garlic too?

45:37.771 --> 45:39.800
Seriously, man,
we can't let those bananas

45:39.800 --> 45:41.205
think that they can
take us on.

45:41.205 --> 45:45.580
We're going to, bashing them
again, it's not going to fix it.

45:47.520 --> 45:48.740
Fuck!

45:51.854 --> 45:54.900
Anyway, what I got in my
mind, it's way better.

45:55.309 --> 45:56.740
I'll see you later.

45:57.820 --> 45:59.620
We've still got to
talk about Joey.

45:59.988 --> 46:01.720
Speaking of bananas.

46:01.984 --> 46:04.300
Yeah, well,
he scaled up big time.

46:06.867 --> 46:08.616
Lasers is just a front.

46:08.616 --> 46:10.622
Jesus, does Nasa know?

46:11.160 --> 46:12.700
I told him last night.

46:13.080 --> 46:14.289
What did he think?

46:14.753 --> 46:16.833
This is total
fucking bullshit.

46:18.140 --> 46:20.256
How he do this and think
we not find out, huh?

46:20.256 --> 46:21.616
Shut up,
for fuck's sake,

46:21.616 --> 46:22.789
you're going to give
yourself a heart attack.

46:22.789 --> 46:24.600
He's threatening
the entire strip, Ezra.

46:24.600 --> 46:26.920
- Yeah, well, times change.
- What,

46:26.920 --> 46:28.440
- times change?
- Yeah.

46:28.640 --> 46:30.576
There's this cocaine
vending machine

46:30.576 --> 46:33.126
in the middle
of Kings Cross, okay,

46:33.126 --> 46:36.261
so minimum we have to charge
him more than the clubs,

46:36.261 --> 46:38.616
maybe two times,
three times more.

46:38.616 --> 46:40.856
And when Crellan,
he find out about this,

46:40.856 --> 46:43.747
the laugh will be more
for us again, okay.

46:43.747 --> 46:46.056
Ezra, listen to me,

46:46.056 --> 46:49.216
you and I, we do this
for a long time, okay,

46:49.216 --> 46:50.800
we know there will
always be drugs here,

46:50.800 --> 46:52.616
but this, this not for us.

46:52.616 --> 46:55.656
Okay, in my heart, I know
this will end up bad.

46:55.656 --> 46:58.696
We need to shut this down
before we lose all control.

46:58.696 --> 47:00.696
Yeah, well,
give them a month.

47:00.696 --> 47:04.200
You put money in the
slot, Ezra, out comes trouble.

47:04.440 --> 47:05.955
Oh, maybe, maybe not.

47:05.955 --> 47:09.296
No, I don't like this
bullshit, okay,

47:09.296 --> 47:11.016
I don't like any of this.

47:11.016 --> 47:13.136
All right, well then, you
take a back seat on this one

47:13.136 --> 47:14.720
and Joey can kick up direct.

47:14.720 --> 47:15.800
What?

47:17.359 --> 47:20.300
So this is how it happen
after all these years, hm?

47:20.680 --> 47:24.580
You ask me to your house and
then you stab me in the heart?

47:25.360 --> 47:27.736
Stop being such a fucking
drama queen, all right?

47:27.736 --> 47:29.620
You're not getting any younger.

47:31.160 --> 47:32.780
Let the kids have this one.

47:55.898 --> 47:56.974
What do you think?

47:57.680 --> 48:02.313
It's amazing, top line
security, primo finishes,

48:03.396 --> 48:05.020
that view.

48:07.300 --> 48:08.580
It's a lot of house.

48:09.713 --> 48:11.660
How much are they asking?

48:14.271 --> 48:15.460
Two mill.

48:18.628 --> 48:19.940
Can you handle that?

48:23.120 --> 48:26.820
I can, if you can
manage the deposit.

48:27.921 --> 48:29.100
You good for it?

48:33.460 --> 48:39.180
I will be, if you say the
sale price is 2.3 mill,

48:45.762 --> 48:46.960
Because then I'll go
to the lender

48:46.960 --> 48:49.320
and say I've got
a $300,000 deposit

48:49.320 --> 48:51.300
and I only need
to borrow two mill.

49:06.151 --> 49:07.300
Good man.

49:12.260 --> 49:14.500
Heard you've been
talking to the club owners?

49:14.706 --> 49:15.900
Who'd you hear that from?

49:17.108 --> 49:18.660
Fuck you up, did he Johnny?

49:18.885 --> 49:19.920
Nothing much.

49:19.920 --> 49:22.253
Yeah, well, whatever,
remember this,

49:22.253 --> 49:24.080
it's always good manners
to run it by the man first,

49:24.080 --> 49:25.260
do you understand?

49:34.020 --> 49:36.653
This is a brutal fucking
business, John, talk to him.

49:36.653 --> 49:38.820
Sort it out.

49:39.293 --> 49:42.760
No, that's not possible
anymore, I want him out.

49:42.760 --> 49:44.540
I came to you out
of respect first.

49:45.155 --> 49:48.580
Okay, well, the cunt did
hire the bikies, didn't he?

49:49.400 --> 49:50.940
I want to take over his club.

49:53.960 --> 49:55.040
Why?

49:55.040 --> 49:57.680
Oh, you know why,
he treats his girls badly,

49:57.680 --> 49:59.973
he feeds them heroin,
he bashes them.

50:00.444 --> 50:02.840
The man is a pig and he's bad
for business for all of us,

50:02.840 --> 50:07.352
so I would like your
blessing is all.

50:07.352 --> 50:10.976
Okay, I'll tell you what,
you and your brother,

50:10.976 --> 50:13.378
you work out this shit
with the bikies, right?

50:13.378 --> 50:15.720
Then make peace
between Nasa and Joey

50:15.720 --> 50:17.800
and then Fat Fuck George
is all yours.

50:18.204 --> 50:19.420
I can do that.

50:19.640 --> 50:21.340
All right,
then get it done.

50:25.056 --> 50:27.600
- Enjoy your game.
- Cheers, mate.

50:28.040 --> 50:29.260
Whoa!

50:34.127 --> 50:35.840
You know, someone's
going to give that kid

50:35.840 --> 50:37.700
a fucking smack one day.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.098
The deal is Ezra
wants us to make peace

51:00.098 --> 51:01.558
with the Black Flags.

51:02.620 --> 51:04.628
So why does it have
to be this morning?

51:04.880 --> 51:07.200
Oh, you've got something
better on, huh?

51:07.200 --> 51:09.420
You should take Dave
and JT if you like.

51:10.444 --> 51:12.420
No, they'll just get
in the way anyway.

51:14.456 --> 51:16.060
Are you going to be
okay with this?

51:17.111 --> 51:20.860
What, you want to hold
my hand, huh, huh?

51:20.860 --> 51:22.560
You sure you want
to miss the fun?

51:22.895 --> 51:24.060
Okay.

51:26.797 --> 51:30.620
Hey, George, get down here,
you fat fuck!

51:33.720 --> 51:35.800
Hey, afraid I was
going to miss it.

51:35.800 --> 51:37.301
Well, maybe he's not home.

51:37.301 --> 51:38.843
Probably sleeping
off a hangover.

51:38.843 --> 51:40.385
Yeah or a Big Mac.

51:40.385 --> 51:42.160
Come on! Come on,
you fat fuck!

51:42.160 --> 51:43.680
Get up!

51:43.680 --> 51:45.794
What the fuck do you want?

51:45.794 --> 51:47.880
I fucking want you to pack
your shit up, fat man,

51:47.880 --> 51:49.440
it's your last day
in the Cross.

51:49.440 --> 51:50.595
What?

51:50.595 --> 51:51.840
Yeah, your lease
has been terminated.

51:52.914 --> 51:56.160
In there's a copy of a new one, you'll see
that Steph is the new leaseholder.

51:57.560 --> 52:01.020
You're joking,
she's just a fucking stripper.

52:01.186 --> 52:03.578
I've been managing this place
for you for years, George,

52:03.578 --> 52:04.920
looking after the girls
and not getting paid

52:04.920 --> 52:07.700
a red cent for it.
That stops now.

52:07.921 --> 52:09.500
Me and Sam are her partners.

52:11.835 --> 52:13.520
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

52:13.520 --> 52:14.820
Piss off.

52:14.820 --> 52:16.160
I'm serious, George.

52:16.301 --> 52:19.600
Yeah and so am I, I answer to
Ezra, not you, chicken shit.

52:19.600 --> 52:21.180
He won't stand for this.

52:21.352 --> 52:23.820
Oh, it's funny 'cause Ezra's
the one who signed off on it.

52:24.318 --> 52:26.800
You know the rules, George,
leases can be broken,

52:26.800 --> 52:28.820
if the leaseholder's
a fat piece of shit.

52:29.547 --> 52:31.439
So why don't you go put on
some fucking normal clothes,

52:31.439 --> 52:32.920
get out of her office,
you've got 30 minutes.

52:34.162 --> 52:35.920
- What?
- This is fucked, boys!

52:35.920 --> 52:36.960
Fuck me!

52:36.960 --> 52:38.360
What does he want us
to do about it?

52:38.360 --> 52:40.340
You want to complain,
you call him from Athens.

52:40.791 --> 52:42.780
Come on, Tony,
he's kidding, right?

52:43.277 --> 52:44.940
You want to argue with Ezra?

52:46.043 --> 52:47.660
You've got 29 minutes.

52:52.471 --> 52:53.560
Stop.

52:54.993 --> 52:56.540
Okay, stay there.

52:57.402 --> 53:01.820
Okay, okay, okay, hey,
hey, hey, it's over, mate.

53:02.124 --> 53:04.140
This is fucking bullshit.

53:12.650 --> 53:14.900
Fuck, that doesn't
seem right, eh?

53:55.239 --> 53:57.133
What the fuck
are you doing here?

53:57.280 --> 53:59.900
Fuck me, famous Aussie
hospitality, huh?

54:01.941 --> 54:04.580
You've got five seconds
to fuck off.

54:14.013 --> 54:16.420
I don't know, maybe it's
just me, but where I'm from,

54:17.540 --> 54:19.300
we offer our guests
something to eat.

54:24.696 --> 54:27.660
So who's in charge around here,
surely not this fuckwit?

54:28.373 --> 54:30.900
That, would be me.

54:35.082 --> 54:36.220
Who are you?

54:38.143 --> 54:39.560
It's that Lebo
I was telling you about

54:39.560 --> 54:40.820
from the other night.

54:40.820 --> 54:43.140
Oh, you're the one?

54:43.729 --> 54:44.900
You're the boss?

54:46.060 --> 54:47.620
What the fuck you doing here?

54:48.791 --> 54:50.058
Are you lost?

54:51.976 --> 54:53.820
I've just come
to pay my respects.

54:53.820 --> 54:56.720
I figure you boys
got paid pretty well

54:56.720 --> 54:57.960
the other night, yeah?

54:58.271 --> 55:00.060
That's it, no hard feelings,
I was hoping,

55:00.740 --> 55:03.587
that we could put it down to
a few fuckwits on your end

55:03.587 --> 55:06.300
and a smart arse
little brother on mine.

55:07.568 --> 55:10.060
So are we supposed
to kiss and make up?

55:13.251 --> 55:14.980
Or we can escalate
things, cock.

55:16.799 --> 55:18.220
Is that what you want?

55:19.140 --> 55:21.940
How's your leg, hm?

55:23.174 --> 55:24.700
Let's go. You and me.

55:29.417 --> 55:31.477
He's not even strapped.

55:31.477 --> 55:33.240
Fucking crazy Leb, hey?

55:34.594 --> 55:38.140
That's right, not right
in the head, mate.

55:47.496 --> 55:48.740
What about you?

55:58.635 --> 56:03.486
Someone,
get this man a beer.

56:07.854 --> 56:09.780
Told you he's fucking crazy.

56:20.057 --> 56:22.820
Mol, hey, what's going on?

56:23.474 --> 56:26.260
Hey, talk to me,
what's going on?

56:28.052 --> 56:30.840
Nothing, can we just go home?

56:30.840 --> 56:32.180
What happened?

56:33.428 --> 56:34.920
Talk to me.

56:35.286 --> 56:36.887
It won't happen again.

56:37.744 --> 56:39.100
Just take me home.

56:41.587 --> 56:44.500
John, can we just go home?

56:50.171 --> 56:51.980
Okay, okay.

56:54.100 --> 56:57.101
It's okay, it's okay.

57:06.024 --> 57:07.160
We're closed.

57:07.160 --> 57:08.660
I'm here to see Mr. Li.

57:09.902 --> 57:11.740
Tell him I got
something for him.

57:27.560 --> 57:29.160
I am told you
have something for me,

57:29.160 --> 57:31.580
but I do not know you.

57:31.580 --> 57:32.940
Not yet, no.

57:34.330 --> 57:38.500
It is a desperate man who
accepts unwanted gifts.

57:48.432 --> 57:50.060
Did you forget the rest?

57:51.210 --> 57:54.728
It's all I have,
a little more than $50,000.

57:54.728 --> 57:56.687
What would you have me
do with this?

57:56.687 --> 57:59.160
I'd like you to supply
me with product.

57:59.160 --> 58:00.280
Heroin?

58:00.280 --> 58:01.640
Cocaine.

58:02.120 --> 58:04.360
50,000 does not
get you very much.

58:04.360 --> 58:06.361
Enough to prove
that I'm serious.

58:06.361 --> 58:09.362
How about I
double the amount

58:09.362 --> 58:11.460
and you take half
on consignment?

58:13.096 --> 58:14.655
I don't like to be in debt.

58:14.924 --> 58:17.700
Very wise and
you will be in debt.

58:18.176 --> 58:19.860
Is that acceptable to you?

58:24.806 --> 58:25.806
Yes.

58:26.496 --> 58:27.880
Where is your market?

58:27.880 --> 58:29.160
Kings Cross.

58:29.160 --> 58:34.380
Ah, that is shut to us,
we have tried.

58:35.340 --> 58:37.740
You must have an arrangement
in place, yeah?

58:38.352 --> 58:39.460
Yes.

58:39.687 --> 58:40.860
You are lying.

58:45.210 --> 58:46.340
Yes.

58:53.636 --> 58:54.980
Have a drink with me.

59:18.946 --> 59:20.260
Hey, cock.

59:22.132 --> 59:23.220
Remember me?

59:25.643 --> 59:26.993
What do you want?

59:27.228 --> 59:28.540
Give us your keys.

59:30.407 --> 59:31.420
What?

59:31.646 --> 59:33.872
Give me,

59:34.271 --> 59:37.660
your fucking keys.

1:00:03.170 --> 1:00:04.340
Get in.

1:00:08.040 --> 1:00:09.100
Why?

1:00:09.851 --> 1:00:11.340
You know why.

1:00:13.069 --> 1:00:14.800
Okay, look, mate,
this is crazy.

1:00:14.800 --> 1:00:16.540
Get in the fucking boot.

1:00:33.433 --> 1:00:35.280
- No, mate, this is crazy...
- Get in!

1:00:35.280 --> 1:00:37.500
Okay, okay, yeah,
yeah, yeah, okay.

1:01:02.602 --> 1:01:04.180
Mate, I...
