00:21.480 --> 00:24.043
Look what I found in Mom and Dad's
interesting-smelling closet.

00:24.096 --> 00:25.872
Wait, what were
you doing in our closet?

00:25.940 --> 00:28.510
Bup, bup, bup! A box of
old tapes, which I believe

00:28.578 --> 00:30.455
includes a tape of
a certain song

00:30.523 --> 00:32.330
someone sang
to a certain poop

00:32.398 --> 00:34.424
- when she was little.
- No! What?

00:34.492 --> 00:35.775
I thought
I destroyed that tape.

00:35.843 --> 00:37.843
Your mom made a copy.
She loved that song.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.486
- Behold.
- The legendary

00:39.554 --> 00:41.072
Tina singing
to her poop tape.

00:41.140 --> 00:43.769
And after she sings to it,
she flushes it and then cries.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.359
Like a Viking funeral.

00:45.427 --> 00:47.507
You know what? I think
I might just go into the kitchen.

00:47.575 --> 00:51.398
- Uh, anyone want any... crackers?
- Hey! Geez, Tina.

00:51.466 --> 00:53.390
That's, like, the most
athletic you've ever been.

00:53.465 --> 00:55.968
No one can see this. I'm
a mature young woman now

00:56.045 --> 00:57.878
who just flushes her
poop, and that's that.

00:57.955 --> 00:59.713
So I'm gonna swallow this.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.437
It's not working.

01:01.505 --> 01:02.975
Tina, get the tape
out of your mouth.

01:03.052 --> 01:04.418
Fine, then I'm gonna go
hide this.

01:04.495 --> 01:06.486
- Not in my room.
- I'm back.

01:06.563 --> 01:08.492
- How was PTA?
- P-T-Great.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.265
After the meeting,
I had a nice talk

01:10.333 --> 01:12.375
with Ruthanne Donahue,
Patrick's mom.

01:12.443 --> 01:13.694
I think he's in your grade,
Gene.

01:13.771 --> 01:15.398
Patrick Donahue.
Good at math,

01:15.466 --> 01:17.294
has a weird laugh.
That's all I know.

01:17.427 --> 01:19.358
So, Ruthanne and I were
talking,

01:19.435 --> 01:22.046
and she said, "We should
do a double date sometime."

01:22.114 --> 01:25.234
And I said, "Yeah." And
she said, "How's tomorrow?"

01:25.302 --> 01:26.506
And you said...

01:26.583 --> 01:28.033
- no? Lin.
- Yes.

01:28.110 --> 01:29.468
It happened so fast.

01:29.545 --> 01:31.236
She pulled out her
calendar and everything.

01:31.313 --> 01:32.891
You were supposed to say,
"Let me get back to you"

01:32.968 --> 01:34.092
and then never get back
to her.

01:34.169 --> 01:36.578
- So lie?
- No, not lie.

01:36.646 --> 01:40.078
Just say "no" but in
a really indirect way.

01:40.146 --> 01:42.875
Come on, Bob. We don't have
any friends who are couples.

01:42.943 --> 01:44.191
Think of
how fun it would be

01:44.259 --> 01:46.138
if we had best couple friends.

01:49.098 --> 01:52.562

kitchen with Dinah ♪

01:54.470 --> 01:56.916
Wait, you want to go on
one of those train things?

01:56.984 --> 01:58.916
- Yeah. Double date.
- Can't we just tell them

01:58.984 --> 02:00.806
- we got sick or something?
- Lie again?

02:00.874 --> 02:02.556
- Tina, please.
- Maybe we'll have fun

02:02.624 --> 02:04.002
and this date'll
surprise you.

02:04.079 --> 02:06.205
Like when you think
a guy is gonna murder you

02:06.273 --> 02:07.281
and then he proposes.

02:07.358 --> 02:09.041
Come on, Bob.
Please?

02:09.304 --> 02:11.853
- Uh, fine, I'll go.
- All right!

02:11.921 --> 02:13.437
Whoa. What is this?

02:13.530 --> 02:16.585
Oh! Oh, yeah. This is a zombie
movie from the early '80s.

02:16.667 --> 02:18.726
A bunch of people get
trapped in a Jewish deli.

02:18.794 --> 02:21.070
It's called
Again with the Living Dead.

02:21.138 --> 02:23.642
Zombies in a deli? I'll
have some of that on rye.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.398
- Am I right?
- I forgot I had this.

02:25.468 --> 02:27.002
It's so good. And scary.

02:27.070 --> 02:29.903
But it's also funny. I mean,
in a really messed up way.

02:29.980 --> 02:32.030
- Huh.
- Oh, but it's not for kids.

02:32.107 --> 02:33.907
Y-You guys should never watch it.

02:33.984 --> 02:35.108
Till you're maybe 20.

02:35.185 --> 02:36.768
Sure. Sure. Sure, sure.

02:36.845 --> 02:38.470
Tonight! One night only.

02:38.547 --> 02:40.182
Again with the Living Dead.

02:40.259 --> 02:42.374
The scariest movie
about a Jewish deli

02:42.451 --> 02:44.484
- you'll ever see.
- Top ten, at least.

02:44.561 --> 02:45.919
Our parents leave at 7:00.

02:45.996 --> 02:48.313
Movie starts at 7:05.
Who's in?

02:48.390 --> 02:50.282
Me. I'll bring
an extra inhaler.

02:50.359 --> 02:53.026
I might watch through my hands,
but just 'cause I like my hands.

02:53.103 --> 02:55.162
I'm in. I like a little
shiver in my liver.

02:55.239 --> 02:57.364
- Right, Jay Ju? Get over...
- Ow! Zeke.

02:57.441 --> 02:59.787
- Zeke, stop.
- We want to come, too.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.141
Aaah!
That's my scary movie sound.

03:02.209 --> 03:04.969
A-ooga! That's my
"no, you didn't" sound.

03:05.046 --> 03:07.010
Oh, and this isn't a free show, people.

03:07.087 --> 03:09.740
The entrance fee is candy. Plus tax,

03:09.817 --> 03:11.709
which is candy. Okay, scat.

03:11.786 --> 03:13.952
And don't tell Tina. She'll
get all babysitter on us.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.831
- Hmm.
- Hey, T.

03:15.899 --> 03:18.082
- Hello.
- Hey, what's going on?

03:18.159 --> 03:20.443
We were just telling
everyone how excited we are

03:20.511 --> 03:22.154
to have you babysit for us
tonight.

03:22.222 --> 03:23.235
'Cause it's such a treat.

03:23.310 --> 03:24.785
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

03:24.853 --> 03:26.915
I mean... babysitting is a
lot of responsibility,

03:26.983 --> 03:28.609
but at the ripe old age of 13,

03:28.685 --> 03:30.618
I think I've learned
a few tricks. Watch this.

03:30.686 --> 03:34.108
Hoh! Who's getting sleepy?

03:34.176 --> 03:35.231
Me.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.109
Oh, she's good.

03:37.832 --> 03:38.937
Okay, kids.

03:39.005 --> 03:41.577
We're going on a double date
with our new couple friends.

03:41.685 --> 03:43.240
Double couple trouble.

03:43.317 --> 03:45.773
Don't come on too strong, Mom.
You don't want to give them

03:45.841 --> 03:47.386
the full Linda
on the first date.

03:47.463 --> 03:48.746

- Oh, boy.

03:54.214 --> 03:55.404
you'll try to have fun
tonight.

03:55.471 --> 03:56.995
Don't complain like you like to do.

03:57.072 --> 03:58.730
W-What do you mean,
"like I like to do"?

03:58.807 --> 04:01.767
You know, you make your
little noises and your faces.

04:01.844 --> 04:03.427
Dad has resting "B" face.

04:03.504 --> 04:06.030
Okay, Lin, fine. I
promise I won't complain

04:06.107 --> 04:09.099
if you don't say "this is
fun" over and over again.

04:09.176 --> 04:11.110
Saying something's fun
doesn't make it fun.

04:11.187 --> 04:12.250
Fine. Come on.

Let's go. Bye, bye, bye.
Mwah.

04:13.781 --> 04:15.305
- Stay out of my room.
- You got it.

04:15.382 --> 04:17.082
All right,
I'm gonna go into Mom's room.

04:17.159 --> 04:19.317
Gene, check the VCR and
make sure it's hooked up.

04:19.394 --> 04:21.427
- On it.
- What are you guys doing?

04:21.567 --> 04:23.406
Listen, I didn't want
to say anything earlier

04:23.474 --> 04:24.623
because I knew
you'd be like...

04:24.700 --> 04:26.250
"No, we can't invite people over

04:26.327 --> 04:28.452
to watch that scary movie
Dad told us not to watch."

04:28.529 --> 04:30.195
What? No, we can't invite
people over...

04:30.272 --> 04:32.630
To watch that scary movie
Dad told us not to watch.

04:32.707 --> 04:34.758
- Uh-huh.
- You guys, I can't let this happen.

04:34.835 --> 04:36.122

Tina, when Dad said,
"Don't watch the movie,"

04:38.392 --> 04:40.891
what he really meant
was, "Watch the movie."

04:40.959 --> 04:42.975
I mean,
he was practically winking.

04:43.052 --> 04:44.094
I don't know.

04:44.171 --> 04:46.570
Jimmy Jr. is already
on his way over.

04:46.638 --> 04:48.375
And he's gonna need
someone to comfort him

04:48.443 --> 04:49.948
- if he gets scared.
- Huh.

04:50.025 --> 04:52.810
Comfort Jimmy Jr. Okay,
I'll allow it.

04:52.887 --> 04:54.786
I mean, zombies are more
sexy than scary, right?

04:54.940 --> 04:57.299
I think everyone
would agree with that.

04:58.559 --> 04:59.683
Where are they?

04:59.760 --> 05:00.993
They must not be here.

05:01.070 --> 05:02.165
Uh, let's go home.

05:02.233 --> 05:03.821
Stop being
a negative noodle.

05:03.898 --> 05:05.207
You just need
to get used to the fact

05:05.275 --> 05:06.725
that we're gonna have
a good time.

05:06.942 --> 05:08.525
Oh, God.
There are people sitting

05:08.602 --> 05:10.335
with a dog. Please
don't let that be them.

05:10.412 --> 05:12.029
Linda! Over here!

05:12.106 --> 05:13.597
Oh, my God. It is.

05:13.666 --> 05:15.053
Oh, hi, Ruthanne.

05:15.129 --> 05:16.975
Bob, Linda,
this is Nicholas.

05:17.051 --> 05:17.816
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:17.884 --> 05:19.324
And this is Lars.

05:19.547 --> 05:21.914
You brought your dog...
to a restaurant.

05:21.991 --> 05:24.121
Lars is my emotional
support dog.

05:24.285 --> 05:26.285
Yep. We bring him everywhere we go.

05:26.363 --> 05:28.687
Everywhere. All the time. It's fine.

05:28.756 --> 05:31.342
So, uh,
should we get another chair?

05:31.418 --> 05:33.058
No, no, no, no. Lars, scoot.

05:33.135 --> 05:34.184
Sit here, Linda.

05:34.261 --> 05:35.928
Aw, thanks for the seat, Lars.

05:36.005 --> 05:38.455
Aw, he got scared.

05:38.532 --> 05:40.177
Oh, don't pet his ears
like that. He hates that.

05:40.254 --> 05:41.941
Oh, my God! Oh, no! -Ooh!

05:42.009 --> 05:43.709
Oh! Oh, oh, I'm stuck.

05:43.777 --> 05:45.362
- I'm stuck.
- Oh, God. Geez.

05:45.439 --> 05:47.384
- Let me... let me help you.
- So sorry about that.

05:47.461 --> 05:49.608
- It's okay.
- I was talking to Lars.

05:49.685 --> 05:52.202
Oh. Uh, well, this is fun.

05:52.279 --> 05:55.983
- I-I mean, uh, double date. Yay.
- Yep.

05:59.116 --> 06:01.548
I'm so glad we decided
to share everything.

06:01.616 --> 06:03.499
I hate when people
order their own meals.

06:03.576 --> 06:05.443
It's like, "Oh, you want
to order what you like

06:05.520 --> 06:07.837
and eat it all?" Selfish, right?

06:07.914 --> 06:10.186
Are there any more
shrimps? I didn't get any.

06:10.263 --> 06:11.754
Remember we said we
were gonna order two,

06:11.831 --> 06:12.863
and then Ruthanne said

06:12.931 --> 06:13.932
- we were just gonna order one?
I... You know, just one.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.100
- Yeah.
- We just need one.

06:15.168 --> 06:16.759
There's
tons of the tomato salad

06:16.836 --> 06:19.070
that Ruthanne was very
excited about at one point.

06:19.147 --> 06:21.105
I need something over
here. I'm starving.

06:21.182 --> 06:24.234
So, uh, Nicholas, Lars
gives you emotional support?

06:24.311 --> 06:25.902
Yes, that's right. He-he does.

06:25.979 --> 06:27.570
What's your emotional... thing?

06:27.647 --> 06:29.480
I mean, if you don't mind me asking?

06:29.557 --> 06:31.441
My therapist says I have PTSD.

06:31.518 --> 06:33.243
My other therapist says I don't.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.219
But my psychic says I definitely do,

06:35.296 --> 06:36.713
so that's two to one.

06:36.790 --> 06:39.849
- Oh, were you...
- I'm working through some trauma

06:39.926 --> 06:42.532
from when I was in an a
cappella group in college.

06:42.609 --> 06:43.686
And...

06:43.763 --> 06:45.188
And it was a cappella.

06:45.265 --> 06:46.764
There wasn't any music. Ever.

06:46.841 --> 06:48.391
- People hated us.
- Huh.

06:48.468 --> 06:50.802
And now we have Lars. And that's okay.

06:50.879 --> 06:54.030
So, uh, what do you
guys like to do for fun?

06:54.107 --> 06:56.674
- Tennis, anyone? Ha!
- I can't play sports.

06:56.751 --> 06:58.768
- I have inverted arms.
- Oh.

06:58.845 --> 07:00.050
We do like to do
escape rooms.

07:00.118 --> 07:01.297
Have you ever done
one of those?

07:01.367 --> 07:02.385
What's an escape room?

07:02.453 --> 07:04.449
You go to a place where
you get locked in a room

07:04.526 --> 07:07.143
that looks like a war
bunker or a-a dungeon,

07:07.220 --> 07:08.920
and you have to figure
out how to escape.

07:08.997 --> 07:11.981
- Oh, that sounds, uh...
- It is.

07:12.058 --> 07:13.925
Uh, Nicholas, you like
going to escape rooms

07:14.002 --> 07:17.220
after what you've been through
with the a cappella thing?

07:17.297 --> 07:19.097
You're not really locked inside, Bob.

07:19.174 --> 07:20.431
Grow up, buddy. Come on.

07:20.508 --> 07:22.058
- Uh, okay.
- It's just fun.

07:22.135 --> 07:24.469
- It's just a joke. Ooh!
- We should all go sometime.

07:24.538 --> 07:26.440
- Uh... Oh!
- Eh...

07:26.508 --> 07:29.207
Uh, Lars is, uh, 
sniffing my crotch.

07:29.284 --> 07:30.433
Uh, like, a lot.

07:30.510 --> 07:31.634
- Oh, yeah, he is.
- Yeah.

07:31.711 --> 07:32.802
I-I want to push him away,

07:32.879 --> 07:34.212
but I'm afraid
he's gonna bite me.

07:34.289 --> 07:35.847
Yeah, that's the... that's the thing.

07:35.924 --> 07:36.940
Um, so... Ooh!

07:37.017 --> 07:39.117
Can you, um, get him to stop?

07:39.194 --> 07:42.153
Lars. Lars. Lars?

07:42.230 --> 07:44.188
Lars. Lars!

07:44.335 --> 07:46.183
Lars! Lars!

07:46.269 --> 07:47.325
That's okay. Forget it.

07:48.662 --> 07:49.861
All right, people.

07:49.938 --> 07:51.821
Handy over the candy.

07:51.898 --> 07:53.865
- Gene?
- Welcome to the Belcherplex.

07:53.942 --> 07:56.234
Please silence your
phones and your butts.

07:56.311 --> 07:58.628
I mean, ah, the... Good.

07:58.712 --> 08:00.753
- The lights are out.
- Jimmy Jr., if you get scared,

08:00.821 --> 08:03.441
- I'm here for you.
- Uh, you're kind of close, Tina.

08:03.509 --> 08:05.710
- Can you move over?
- I'm right here if you need me.

08:05.787 --> 08:07.503
Uh, you're still really close.

08:07.580 --> 08:09.480
Shh. Don't talk during the movie.

08:09.738 --> 08:11.174
Can I take your plates?

08:11.251 --> 08:12.884
Oh, I'm still working on mine.

08:12.961 --> 08:16.713
Ruthanne is the slowest eater
I know.

08:16.790 --> 08:18.523
Lars is, uh, the slowest eater, too.

08:18.600 --> 08:20.858
- He's still in there.
- Oh, wow, he is.

08:20.935 --> 08:22.543
And... done.

08:22.611 --> 08:23.676
I-I think we're ready

08:23.744 --> 08:24.955
- for the check.
- Yes.

08:25.023 --> 08:26.975
The gentleman and lady
already paid for your meal.

08:27.043 --> 08:28.057
- What?
- You did?

08:28.134 --> 08:30.393
Yeah. We gave him our
credit card when we got here.

08:30.470 --> 08:32.462
Don't worry about it.
You guys can get the next one.

08:32.539 --> 08:34.831
- Yeah. Yeah, you know.
- Yeah. Yeah, we'll work things out.

08:34.908 --> 08:36.018
- We'll schedule something.
- Um, whenever.

08:36.095 --> 08:37.467
Or how about this?

08:37.544 --> 08:39.802
You guys can get 
dessert right now.

08:39.879 --> 08:42.371
Ooh, yes! 
Should we go get some gelato?

08:42.448 --> 08:43.548
- Uh...
- Ooh, oh, my.

08:43.625 --> 08:46.297
Gelato. Gelato.

08:46.365 --> 08:47.401
Hey, he's out.

08:47.469 --> 08:48.978
My pants are really wet.

08:49.055 --> 08:50.688
Girls in one car, boys in the other.

08:50.765 --> 08:52.382
- Linda, I'll drive us.
- Uh...

08:52.459 --> 08:54.225
We're with you, Bob. 
Lars calls shotgun.

08:54.302 --> 08:55.359
He gets carsick.

08:55.436 --> 08:57.195
- Bobby. Bobby.
- Lin.

08:57.272 --> 08:58.321
Lin.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.594
This isn't so scary.

09:02.329 --> 09:04.032
Nope, I was wrong. It's scary.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.175
Hey, Mr. Goldberg.

09:05.243 --> 09:06.797
You want your usual?

09:07.360 --> 09:08.464
You look different.

09:08.532 --> 09:10.119
Did you, uh, get a new haircut?

09:12.112 --> 09:14.858
This movie's ruining roast
beef sandwiches for me.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.213
Smells like old fries in here.

09:17.283 --> 09:19.075
Uh, it's probably the old fries.

09:19.152 --> 09:20.852
I can't find the button for the window.

09:20.929 --> 09:22.120
I just want a little air.

09:22.197 --> 09:23.821
Oh, it's a hand crank. Sorry.

09:23.898 --> 09:25.448
Oh. Uh, okay.

09:25.525 --> 09:27.592
Let's see if I can deal with this.

09:27.669 --> 09:30.453
Uh, w-what's wrong with your dog?

09:30.530 --> 09:32.263
Oh, he's probably just gonna throw up.

09:32.340 --> 09:33.798
Oh, God. Should we pull over?

09:33.875 --> 09:35.466
Oop! He's fine. He swallowed it.

09:35.543 --> 09:37.468
He's a trooper. Good boy, Lars.

09:37.545 --> 09:39.762
It's not that I hate Lars. It's just,

09:39.839 --> 09:43.107
why can't I be my husband's
emotional support dog, you know?

09:43.184 --> 09:44.572
- Uh-huh.
- Ooh!

09:44.649 --> 09:46.344
There's an escape room place.

09:46.421 --> 09:48.204
A what? Oh, oh, yeah.

09:48.281 --> 09:49.806
Should we skip dessert

09:49.883 --> 09:51.115
and do an escape room 
instead?

09:51.192 --> 09:52.719
Oh, I don't think 
we should.

09:52.787 --> 09:54.251
You want to let the
boys know the new plan?

09:54.319 --> 09:55.953
Okay, we're doing this.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.288
I'll text Bob.

09:57.365 --> 09:59.590
"Going to escape room.

09:59.667 --> 10:01.718
No gelato." Send.

10:01.795 --> 10:03.628
Oops, "gelato" auto-typed to "genital."

10:03.705 --> 10:04.796
Oops, did it again.

10:06.466 --> 10:08.144
Can you check that?
It might be from Linda.

10:08.221 --> 10:10.334
I've never gotten a
text from anybody else.

10:10.411 --> 10:13.129
It says we're going to an escape room.

10:13.206 --> 10:15.098
She signed it "genitals genitals."

10:15.175 --> 10:17.166
Is that, like, a nickname for her or...

10:17.243 --> 10:18.876
Wait, we're going to an escape room?

10:18.953 --> 10:20.336
I know. Great, right?

10:20.413 --> 10:21.857
I didn't even know they
had one around here.

10:21.934 --> 10:23.940
Uh-oh. Oh, God.

10:24.017 --> 10:26.175
- He found the old fries.
- Sorry.

10:26.252 --> 10:27.852
It's not even his cheat day.

10:29.222 --> 10:31.322
I don't even want to see it or hear it,

10:31.399 --> 10:33.191
but I don't want to stop watching.

10:33.268 --> 10:35.397
Oh, matzo brain soup.

10:37.497 --> 10:38.908
- I got you, Jay Ju.
- I got you, Jimmy Jr.

10:38.985 --> 10:40.798
Okay, Zeke. Little
bit of an eager beaver.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.134
Maybe I'll just squeeze in here.

10:43.211 --> 10:44.494
Maybe not.

10:44.571 --> 10:45.870
Welcome, everyone...

10:45.947 --> 10:48.506
and dog, to the "jail
break" escape room.

10:48.583 --> 10:52.257
Wow, it's so dirty in
here! Really authentic.

10:52.334 --> 10:55.138
The lobby was dirty,
too. Is that on purpose?

10:55.215 --> 10:57.106
Whoa-hoa. You guys are comin' in hot.

10:57.183 --> 11:00.042
Let's just take a step back
and realize I'm by myself today,

11:00.119 --> 11:02.115
and you guys are the
last room of the night.

11:02.192 --> 11:04.280
- Oh, he's in character.
- I am not.

11:04.357 --> 11:06.691
Once I close this door,
you'll have one hour

11:06.768 --> 11:08.351
to find the key and escape.

11:08.428 --> 11:10.765
All the clues you need
are hidden in this room.

11:10.842 --> 11:12.054
I bet I know where the key is.

11:12.131 --> 11:13.431
It's in that locker right there.

11:13.508 --> 11:15.291
No, it's too obvious, Ruthanne.

11:15.368 --> 11:17.820
I'm not allowed to say,
but it's not obvious.

11:17.897 --> 11:19.061
It's a pretty good spot.

11:19.138 --> 11:20.571
I'll be right outside that door.

11:20.648 --> 11:22.799
If you absolutely need
to leave the escape room

11:22.876 --> 11:25.735
before the hour is up, that's
a panic button right over there.

11:25.812 --> 11:28.212
If you press it, I'll come
and then I'll let you out.

11:28.289 --> 11:30.391
Can we press it now?
Just kidding. Kinda.

11:30.468 --> 11:31.719
And I'm gonna collect your phones

11:31.796 --> 11:32.950
so you won't take any pictures.

11:33.027 --> 11:34.811
We also don't want you to use them

11:34.888 --> 11:36.534
to, uh, post bad reviews online.

11:36.611 --> 11:38.414
Not that we've ever
gotten lots of those.

11:38.491 --> 11:40.164
Wait, wait, wait. Before we get started,

11:40.232 --> 11:41.852
can Lars and I run
to the boys' room?

11:41.920 --> 11:43.527
Yeah, I want to go to the ladies' room.

11:43.604 --> 11:44.962
I'll show you where it is.

11:45.039 --> 11:46.656
Lin, this is an awful date.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.966
I know you told me not to
complain, and I'm not...

11:49.043 --> 11:51.391
- That's just a fact.
- I know. I'm not gonna say

11:51.468 --> 11:53.263
this is fun, because
it's not fun, at all.

11:53.340 --> 11:55.439
Let's just do this
escape room as fast as we can,

11:55.516 --> 11:57.775
- so we can go home.
- I should text Tina real quick

11:57.852 --> 11:59.644
before that guy takes our phones away.

11:59.721 --> 12:02.146
Doing an escape room, then coming home.

12:02.223 --> 12:05.483
Double date awful.
Nightmare couple. Kill me.

12:05.560 --> 12:08.773
Sad face, sad face,
sad face, turd. Send.

12:08.850 --> 12:11.295
Okay, if everyone could
surrender your phones, please.

12:11.372 --> 12:13.545
Oh, wait, I just got a text.

12:13.622 --> 12:15.147
Oh, it's from you, Linda.

12:15.224 --> 12:17.591
Oh, God! Don't read
that. Uh, Ruthanne...

12:17.668 --> 12:21.094
It says, "Double date awful.
Nightmare couple. Kill me."

12:21.171 --> 12:23.358
Sad face, sad face, sad face.

12:23.435 --> 12:25.288
Turd. - Oh,
boy. -Ooh.

12:25.426 --> 12:27.059
Anyway, I'll take that.

12:27.170 --> 12:30.186
Okay, everybody, happy escaping.

12:34.536 --> 12:37.818
Okay, okay. I accidentally
sent you a text that said

12:37.895 --> 12:40.029
you were a nightmare
couple, but it was a joke.

12:40.106 --> 12:41.388
It was just a joke.

12:41.465 --> 12:43.532
Lars, I need you more
than ever right now.

12:43.609 --> 12:45.159
Look, this is extremely awkward.

12:45.236 --> 12:47.636
Let's just push the panic
button and get out of here.

12:47.713 --> 12:49.104
Sure. Push the panic button.

12:49.181 --> 12:50.998
Get away from the "nightmare couple."

12:51.066 --> 12:52.457
No, we don't want
to get away from you.

12:52.525 --> 12:53.303
Yes, we do.

12:53.371 --> 12:56.236
No, no, we want to do
the escape room with you.

12:56.313 --> 12:58.802
- That'll make me feel better.
- All right, fine.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.229
Ruthanne said the key was
probably in that locker.

13:01.306 --> 13:02.142
Okay.

13:02.219 --> 13:04.698
It's a combination lock. It's locked.

13:04.775 --> 13:07.635
Yeah, it's a real
sad-face nightmare locker.

13:07.712 --> 13:10.626
- Turd.
- Ignoring Ruthanne and Nicholas.

13:10.703 --> 13:12.127
Look. A letter.

13:12.204 --> 13:13.587
"Dear Prisoner,

13:13.664 --> 13:16.757
The Code is my name.
Sincerely, Your PAL."

13:16.834 --> 13:18.801
- Huh.
- The word "PAL" is capitalized.

13:18.878 --> 13:20.736
Maybe it's a clue... Maybe the code

13:20.813 --> 13:22.645
for the lock
combination is P-A-L.

13:22.722 --> 13:24.740
- Ruthanne, right?
- Mm, mm, mm.

13:24.817 --> 13:26.533
- Nicholas?
- Mm, mm, mm.

13:26.610 --> 13:29.565
Lars? Why am I asking a
dog? Wait, there's more.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.959
"A + B=14."

13:32.036 --> 13:33.241
- There's math?
- Yeah.

13:33.318 --> 13:35.379
So the letter "A" is in the word "PAL."

13:35.456 --> 13:37.473
- Right.
- And "A" and "B" are numbers

13:37.550 --> 13:39.108
that add up to 14, right?

13:39.185 --> 13:40.249
- Right.
- So...

13:40.326 --> 13:42.645
Four. - Wh-Why are
you saying "four"?

13:42.722 --> 13:45.039
- I don't know.
- Okay, 14 is...

13:45.116 --> 13:46.782
- Four.
- Stop saying "four"!

13:46.859 --> 13:48.567
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

13:49.854 --> 13:51.579
That was amazing.

13:51.656 --> 13:53.581
Everyone have a good time?

13:53.658 --> 13:55.858
At our little movie screening? Anyone?

13:55.935 --> 13:57.526
Can't... talk.

13:57.603 --> 13:58.897
Too scared.

13:58.974 --> 14:01.063
I'll never not be scared.

14:01.140 --> 14:04.174
I'm burning through canisters here.

14:04.251 --> 14:06.421
- Are you guys really scared?
- Mama.

14:06.498 --> 14:08.731
I'm not gonna close my eyes
again, I'll tell you that.

14:08.808 --> 14:09.903
Wait. Let me try.

14:09.980 --> 14:11.938
Bad idea! Oh, no, no! Bad idea!

14:12.015 --> 14:14.335
- Zeke, open your eyes!
- Okay, okay, okay!

14:14.412 --> 14:16.637
- Guys, it's just a movie.
- A great movie.

14:16.714 --> 14:18.272
I mean, it's gonna stay with us,

14:18.349 --> 14:20.216
probably for the rest
of our lives, but...

14:20.293 --> 14:21.806
People, zombies aren't real.

14:21.874 --> 14:23.720
Then how'd they get
the idea for that movie?

14:23.788 --> 14:26.098
Can I use your phone... I'm
calling my mom to come get me.

14:26.175 --> 14:28.173
No. No parents.
You're not supposed to be here.

14:28.241 --> 14:29.666
And you definitely weren't
supposed to be watching

14:29.734 --> 14:31.408
a scary movie
under my supervision.

14:31.768 --> 14:33.791
Hey, we talked about this,
remember?

14:34.048 --> 14:35.374
You were never here,

14:35.451 --> 14:37.539
you didn't watch a
scary movie at our house,

14:37.616 --> 14:39.747
and you're gonna leave
here on your own two feet

14:39.824 --> 14:42.386
in the next few minutes before
our mom and dad come home.

14:42.463 --> 14:44.146
I'm only stepping out of this house

14:44.223 --> 14:46.557
if there's a long line of
grown-ups going all the way

14:46.634 --> 14:48.817
to my house and they're
all willing to hug me.

14:48.894 --> 14:50.968
Louise, no one's leaving.
We've got a problem.

14:51.045 --> 14:52.254
- Yeah, you do.
- Me?

14:52.331 --> 14:54.131
You're the one who
invited everyone over.

14:54.208 --> 14:57.067
But you're the babysitter.
I'm nine. What do I know?

14:57.144 --> 14:58.831
Let me try something.

14:58.908 --> 15:01.472
Hey, guys, let's pretend
we're on a treasure hunt

15:01.549 --> 15:03.709
and the treasure's at your house.

15:03.786 --> 15:04.933
Ready? Go!

15:05.778 --> 15:07.211
Huh. Weird. That didn't work.

15:07.288 --> 15:09.071
Okay, so we found the letter.

15:09.148 --> 15:10.681
- Right.
- And we found the Bible

15:10.758 --> 15:13.123
under the mattress with
another math problem in it.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.948
It's like the friggin' SATs in here.

15:15.025 --> 15:16.577
Oh, we're so bad at this.

15:16.654 --> 15:19.410
Oh, no, you're so good at this.

15:19.487 --> 15:22.547
- Okay, Ruthanne.
- Oh, what is that smell?

15:22.624 --> 15:23.877
I think it was Lars.

15:23.954 --> 15:26.413
He had those fries from
your weird old car, remember?

15:26.490 --> 15:27.938
Ugh. Did it just get worse?

15:28.015 --> 15:30.525
That time it was me. Sorry not sorry.

15:30.602 --> 15:32.272
Oh, two can play at that game, Missy.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.801
- You wouldn't dare.
- Escape this.

15:34.878 --> 15:36.269
Oh, my God.

15:36.346 --> 15:37.729
Okay.

15:37.806 --> 15:39.672
We brought in every lamp from the house,

15:39.749 --> 15:41.423
so it's nice and bright in here,

15:41.500 --> 15:42.844
and we've got The Equestranuats on.

15:42.921 --> 15:44.188
That's a happy show.

15:44.265 --> 15:46.897
You're gonna forget all
about that silly zombie deli.

15:46.974 --> 15:48.837
Aah! Zombie pastrami!

15:48.914 --> 15:50.588
Darryl, we went over this.

15:50.665 --> 15:52.443
The zombie grandma didn't feel anything

15:52.520 --> 15:54.200
when her face went
through the meat slicer.

15:54.774 --> 15:56.046
She doesn't feel pain
because she's not alive.

15:56.123 --> 15:58.653
- Not-not helping.
- Tina, no one's budging.

15:58.730 --> 16:00.384
I know. I-I need to find something

16:00.461 --> 16:02.030
that will make them
forget what they've seen.

16:02.107 --> 16:05.075
What's the exact opposite
of an R-rated zombie movie?

16:05.152 --> 16:07.890
- I'll be right back.
- Well, she's dead.

16:08.499 --> 16:10.828
Ugh! I'm getting close to passing out.

16:10.905 --> 16:12.350
I think I have to push the panic button.

16:12.427 --> 16:13.673
Yeah, the vent's not working.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.186
Wait. Bob, the vent!

16:15.263 --> 16:17.977
Maybe there's a clue inside. It opens!

16:18.054 --> 16:20.638
Aah! Aah! Aah!

16:20.715 --> 16:22.249
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.

16:22.317 --> 16:23.900
- Aah! Aah!
- Okay, hit the panic button!

16:23.968 --> 16:25.078
- Oh, my God! Aah!
- Hit the panic button!

16:25.146 --> 16:27.788
Hello? Hello?
Where's the guy?!

16:27.864 --> 16:31.304
Let us out!
We're panicking! We're panicking!

16:33.930 --> 16:36.109
Is this how escape
rooms are supposed to work?

16:36.178 --> 16:37.844
Trapped in a room
with a crazy rat?

16:37.921 --> 16:39.924
Nicholas, why is the rat
chasing your dog?

16:39.992 --> 16:41.234
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

16:41.311 --> 16:43.709
He's an emotional support dog.
He's very sensitive.

16:43.786 --> 16:47.070
Ooh, this is a cappella
all over again.

16:48.429 --> 16:49.760
♪ Oh, Mickey, you're so fine ♪

16:49.828 --> 16:51.385
♪ You're so fine you blow
my mind, hey, Mickey! ♪

16:51.453 --> 16:53.566
Nicholas,
stop doing a Capella!

16:53.634 --> 16:55.986
I can't help it!
I'm having a flashback!

16:56.054 --> 16:57.470
Ruthanne, Nicholas...

16:57.547 --> 16:59.539
I'm-I'm sorry I sent
you that mean text.

16:59.616 --> 17:01.627
I don't want to die knowing
that I hurt your feelings.

17:01.704 --> 17:03.288
Look, we really
need to get out of here.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.714
Can you please help us?

17:04.829 --> 17:05.720
- Yes!
- Yes!

17:05.797 --> 17:07.579
Bob, stick your hand
down the toilet.

17:07.647 --> 17:09.720
- Excuse me?
- It's not a real toilet.

17:09.788 --> 17:11.617
- Just do what I say!
- Okay, okay.

17:11.694 --> 17:13.512
The rat just grazed my foot.

17:13.580 --> 17:15.770
I found something! It's a UV flashlight!

17:15.838 --> 17:17.925
Shine it at the walls and ceiling.

17:19.232 --> 17:21.387
Look! There's secret
writing on the ceiling.

17:21.527 --> 17:22.787
It says "B equals 8."

17:22.864 --> 17:24.616
"A" plus "B" equals 14!

17:24.684 --> 17:26.391
That means "A" equals 6!

17:26.468 --> 17:29.194
So the second number on the
combination lock must be 6!

17:29.271 --> 17:30.863
Oh, my God,
we're crackin' the code!

17:30.931 --> 17:32.762
I feel just like A Beautiful Mind.

17:35.748 --> 17:37.510
Wait. Is that the tape?

17:37.587 --> 17:39.137
I think it is.

17:39.214 --> 17:40.780
Talk about jumping on a grenade.

17:40.857 --> 17:43.563
Everyone, I found
something that might help.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.244
But before I play this,
let me say, I was four,

17:46.321 --> 17:48.955
and I was going through a phase
that I grew out of... mostly.

17:49.032 --> 17:51.594
- Jimmy Jr., close your eyes.
- Okay.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.171
You ready to flush the poopy, sweetie?

17:54.248 --> 17:55.884
Let me sing my song.

17:55.961 --> 17:57.642
♪ Poo, poo, poo, poo ♪

17:57.719 --> 18:00.091
♪ I love you ♪

18:00.168 --> 18:03.662
♪ Poo, poo, poo,
poo, I'll miss you. ♪

18:03.739 --> 18:06.647
- Uh, what's... happening?
- Oh, and cover your ears.

18:06.724 --> 18:10.497
Okay, say "Bye." We're gonna flush now.

18:10.574 --> 18:12.381
Bye, poopy.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.149
Hope you're okay.

18:14.226 --> 18:17.686
Aw, my teeny Tina and her giant poop.

18:17.763 --> 18:19.321
Uh-oh. Second flush.

18:19.398 --> 18:20.787
It's better than I remembered.

18:20.864 --> 18:23.003
- Yikes.
- Yup. Yup.

18:23.080 --> 18:24.561
Well, I loved it, but I wish

18:24.638 --> 18:26.820
they didn't kill off
my favorite character.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.316
So, how's everyone feeling?

18:28.393 --> 18:30.218
I personally am feeling mortified.

18:30.295 --> 18:31.678
I feel better.

18:31.755 --> 18:33.066
That taught me how to laugh again.

18:33.143 --> 18:34.481
And how to love.

18:34.558 --> 18:35.949
Okay, so, bye. Get out.

18:36.026 --> 18:37.851
Geez, now I know how that poop felt.

18:37.928 --> 18:39.694
Yeah, at least sing us
a song, Tina. Come on!

18:39.771 --> 18:41.521
Out! Out! Out!

18:41.598 --> 18:43.023
Okay. Ruthanne figured out

18:43.100 --> 18:44.744
the math problem in the
bible, so now we know

18:44.821 --> 18:46.434
that "P" equals two and "A" equals six.

18:46.511 --> 18:49.196
So we just need to figure out
what the letter "L" equals.

18:49.273 --> 18:50.839
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Aah! Aah!

18:50.916 --> 18:52.699
Hey, someone wrote the words

18:52.776 --> 18:54.201
"life in prison" on the calendar.

18:54.278 --> 18:56.344
Ooh, that's a clue. What
date is the letter "L" on?

18:56.421 --> 18:59.681
The fifth. Oh! The last
number on the lock must be 5!

18:59.758 --> 19:01.283
Let's unlock the door!

19:01.360 --> 19:03.043
I'll unlock it.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.645
- Really, Nicholas?
- Yes. I can do this.

19:05.722 --> 19:07.547
- Go, Nicholas.
- Go, Nicholas. Go!

19:07.624 --> 19:09.190
- Go!
- Gee. Nope, can't do it.

19:09.267 --> 19:10.550
Damn it!

19:10.627 --> 19:13.553
Nicholas, you can. You
can. I know you can.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.565
Look, I'll distract the animals somehow
so you can make it, Nicholas.

19:16.642 --> 19:19.100
I'll help you, Bob. I'll
take Lars, you take the rat.

19:19.177 --> 19:20.827
- Wait. What?!
- Uh.

19:20.904 --> 19:23.029
Lars, run to me. Come on.

19:23.106 --> 19:25.440
- Oh, they're both coming to me.
- Go, Nicholas!

19:25.517 --> 19:27.086
I can't remember the numbers!

19:27.163 --> 19:28.743
I can't remember any numbers!

19:28.820 --> 19:31.271
Oh, my God, Nicholas,
it's 265. No pressure!

19:31.348 --> 19:32.725
Right, right, right,
right, right, right.

19:32.802 --> 19:35.275
I unlocked it, and there's a key!

19:35.352 --> 19:36.763
- Yes! Open it! Open it!
- Open it! Open it!

19:36.840 --> 19:38.587
- Open it, honey!
- I opened it!

19:41.091 --> 19:42.930
Come on, Lars.

19:44.161 --> 19:45.719
We escaped!

19:45.796 --> 19:47.829
- Ha! Ha!
- We're free, buddy!

19:47.906 --> 19:50.557
Oh, hey, you guys escaped.

19:50.634 --> 19:52.901
- Were you asleep?
- Uh, I might have dozed off.

19:52.978 --> 19:55.403
- There's a rat in there!
- Oh, shoot.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.764
Uh, the rat was a clue.

19:57.841 --> 19:59.733
- Oh, I don't think so.
- All right, fine.

19:59.810 --> 20:01.788
I'll, uh, I'll give you the
rat-in-the-room discount.

20:01.865 --> 20:03.645
We'll take it. Bob
and Linda, pay the man.

20:03.722 --> 20:05.614
Here's three credit
cards. Spread it around.

20:05.691 --> 20:07.515
And your place smells like farts.

20:08.986 --> 20:10.986
Hey, what are you kids still doing up?

20:11.063 --> 20:13.647
Aw, Tina's poop song!

20:13.724 --> 20:15.435
Yeah, I'm gonna hit it
with a hammer pretty soon.

20:15.512 --> 20:17.921
- How was your double date?
- It was... fun.

20:17.998 --> 20:19.452
It was?! You had fun?

20:19.529 --> 20:23.338
I mean, it was awful, but I
feel kind of brave and smart?

20:23.415 --> 20:25.225
- Me, too!
- Eh, that won't last.

20:25.302 --> 20:26.813
- Yeah, you're right.
- Yeah, yeah, it's already gone.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.370
Why are there so many lamps in here?

20:28.447 --> 20:30.605
We were playing lamps... and we won.

20:30.682 --> 20:32.432
Uh, okay. Well, time for bed.

20:32.509 --> 20:34.643
Mom, Dad, can I sleep
in your room tonight?

20:34.720 --> 20:37.904
- Sure, honey. Is everything okay?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

20:37.981 --> 20:39.826
I'm just gonna need to
sleep with a kitchen knife.

20:39.903 --> 20:41.274
Is that gonna be a problem?

20:41.351 --> 20:43.093
Did you guys watch something scary?

20:43.170 --> 20:44.144
- No.
- Uh-uh.

20:44.221 --> 20:45.720
But maybe I'll sleep in your bed, too,

20:45.797 --> 20:47.522
you know, just to
keep the knife company.

20:47.599 --> 20:48.990
Wait. I want in on that action.
