02:34.280 --> 02:35.280
Mm-hmm.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.040
[door unlocks]

03:35.880 --> 03:37.280
-Hi.
-Hey.

03:38.400 --> 03:42.160
Tours begin at 11. You're the first
in line. Could be a busy day.

03:42.240 --> 03:44.240
[British accent] Road seemed pretty empty.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.280
Nice accent. You from Australia?

03:48.360 --> 03:49.840
No, I'm from Britain.

03:50.240 --> 03:54.400
So you got one of those crazy
British names? Esmeralda or, uh...?

03:54.480 --> 03:55.480
I'm Nish.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.480
-Nish?
-Nish.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.560
Well, I can't judge. My name's ridiculous.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.680
Rolo Haynes. Owner. Proprietor.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.240
Well, just us two this morning.
You sure you wanna do this?

04:08.320 --> 04:12.040
-This place ain't for the faint-hearted.
-I'm sure I can handle it.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.960
Not everyone can.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.400
[Rolo chuckles]

04:22.120 --> 04:25.640
So, I have to peek
in your little sack there if that's OK.

04:25.720 --> 04:29.280
-Ah. That's OK.
-Can't trust anyone these days.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.400
If you could step through there.

04:34.880 --> 04:37.000
Anything metal, put it in here.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.080
Cool.

04:39.400 --> 04:41.720
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm. Dinky.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.600
Oh, yeah. I call it fun size.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.360
Fun size. I like that.

04:47.800 --> 04:50.960
Guessing you had a gut full
of this security shit at the airport.

04:51.720 --> 04:54.600
Our immigration guys
are pretty tight these days.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.520
All clear?

04:58.240 --> 04:59.560
-[chimes]
-OK.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.360
Show on the road.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.720
So, you on vacation?

05:05.800 --> 05:07.920
-Sort of. My dad lives out here.
-Uh-huh.

05:08.640 --> 05:11.200
It's his birthday,
so my mom just wants to surprise him.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.720
And you're the surprise?

05:13.360 --> 05:15.280
Hmm, part of it, I guess.

05:15.920 --> 05:18.680
-Where'd you fly in?
-Salt Lake.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.560
You came here from Salt Lake?

05:21.640 --> 05:23.800
Yeah, I thought it'd be nice
to drive the back route,

05:23.880 --> 05:25.320
but I underestimated the--

05:25.400 --> 05:27.400
Heck of a trip for a girl on her own.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.480
-I don't mean to get old-fashioned on you.
-Seriously?

05:32.560 --> 05:34.800
That is quite old-fashioned.

05:34.880 --> 05:36.680
It's hot as hell in here.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.360
AC must've shit the bed.

05:43.520 --> 05:44.600
Sorry for the heat.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.120
[whistles]

05:46.200 --> 05:47.800
Goddamn digital systems.

05:47.880 --> 05:50.040
Never trust a guy in tech.
Jesus, I should know that.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.720
[Nish] So what is all this stuff?

05:52.800 --> 05:55.760
[Rolo] Authentic criminological artifacts.

05:56.400 --> 05:58.840
If it did something bad,
chances are it's in here.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.600
Take a look around, take your time,
see what pops out at you.

06:02.680 --> 06:06.600
Anything piques your interest,
I can tell you all about it.

06:06.680 --> 06:09.640
There's a sad, sick story
behind most everything here.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.360
Just like our main attraction
just through there.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.520
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.920
A lot of folks
just rush behind the curtain,

06:18.000 --> 06:19.920
hardly even eyeball this stuff,

06:20.000 --> 06:24.160
and then it's a bunch of one-star ratings
on Trip-fucker and before you know it--

06:24.240 --> 06:27.320
Yo, look, I am not in a rush,
so don't worry.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.920
Well, then, take your time.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.480
I shall. [chuckles]

06:34.800 --> 06:38.920
-This stuff looks techie.
-Well, neuro tech was my background.

06:39.000 --> 06:39.960
Sweet.

06:41.240 --> 06:44.520
So, what's this, then?
Looks like a hairdressing thing.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.560
Actually, that was one
of my very first souvenirs.

06:47.640 --> 06:50.880
Sheds a little light
on how our main exhibit came to be.

06:50.960 --> 06:53.200
-What is it?
-You heard of Peter Dawson?

06:53.640 --> 06:56.560
-Mnh-mnh.
-Dr. Peter Dawson?

06:56.640 --> 07:02.760
Well, usually I say
this is Dawson's Symphatic Diagnoser,

07:02.840 --> 07:07.120
and folks shriek, "No way,"
and I'm like, "Oh, it very much is."

07:07.200 --> 07:08.040
[chuckles]

07:08.120 --> 07:10.200
"How the heck did you get that?"
is the next question.

07:10.880 --> 07:14.520
-OK.
-My domain was med tech.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.920
I worked out of St. Juniper's.
It's kind of like a university hospital.

07:18.000 --> 07:20.440
Sweet setup.
Part of the Land Act, actually.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.920
It was in downtown New York,
big old building.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.520
Research up top,

07:25.600 --> 07:28.960
emergency room and the great unwashed
down at street level.

07:29.880 --> 07:32.960
It was the perfect mix
of business and health care.

07:33.040 --> 07:34.040
[horn blares]

07:34.120 --> 07:36.080
-Seriously?
-[man] Out of the way, asshole!

07:36.160 --> 07:40.960
[Rolo]  Idea was folks with no coverage
signed up for free health care

07:41.040 --> 07:45.720
in exchange for consenting
to occasional experimental treatments.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.680
I... I... I worked for the guys up top.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.920
What, like a scientist?

07:51.320 --> 07:54.560
I was more sort of... recruitment.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.800
-Yeah, yeah, I'm here.
-Clear.

07:55.880 --> 07:56.800
[machine beeps]

07:57.200 --> 07:58.200
Shocking.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.080
-No.
-No?

08:02.160 --> 08:04.000
-No.
-OK, I'm going again. Clear. Clear!

08:04.080 --> 08:05.880
-[machine beeps]
-Shocking.

08:10.520 --> 08:11.960
-No.
-[sighs]

08:13.800 --> 08:17.040
If I'd known she was on tricyclics,
I would have nudged the dose.

08:17.120 --> 08:18.720
You couldn't have known.

08:21.480 --> 08:22.720
[clears throat]

08:24.040 --> 08:26.120
-This a bad time?
-[scoffs]

08:26.200 --> 08:28.720
Rolo Haynes from the tenth floor.

08:28.800 --> 08:31.080
Seems you've been having some problems.

08:32.360 --> 08:34.280
I think I got something that can help.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.480
The big thing they're into
is neuro technics.

08:46.560 --> 08:48.560
Pioneering brain enhancements.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.680
Neural interfaces.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.720
All that fun stuff.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.600
The holy grail they've been aiming for
is a way to transfer knowledge.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.880
So one of the teams here
is working on an experiment,

09:02.960 --> 09:06.520
trying to find a way to beam information
from one brain to another.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.600
[clears throat]

09:09.320 --> 09:10.520
This is Kenny.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.280
This is Hector.

09:16.120 --> 09:17.840
Stay with me on this.

09:18.440 --> 09:19.560
So, the experiment.

09:19.640 --> 09:22.200
They built a little maze
and they drop Kenny here into it

09:22.280 --> 09:24.480
and he runs round over and over
for months on end

09:25.160 --> 09:27.520
till he knows it like a childhood home.

09:28.200 --> 09:32.800
And then... they put this on him.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.080
It's a transmitter,

09:38.720 --> 09:41.280
absorbing signals from Kenny's brain

09:41.360 --> 09:44.120
which were sent to Hector over here.

09:44.200 --> 09:47.040
Hector had our prototype
synaptic receiver fitted.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.880
Now, remember, Hector had never
even set paw in the maze.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.560
Plan was he'd now receive
Kenny's knowledge of the maze layout

09:54.640 --> 09:58.120
and, boom,
he'd be able to solve it, first time.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.520
-And did he?
-No.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.960
Scrabbled around like a rat,
fucking imbecile.

10:03.040 --> 10:06.520
So, um, why are you telling me this?

10:06.600 --> 10:09.840
Because just as it becomes clear
that the maze thing's a bust,

10:09.920 --> 10:12.120
one of our researchers
spills his coffee on Kenny.

10:12.640 --> 10:17.200
Hot coffee spills all over Kenny,
so obviously he's squealing like hell,

10:17.280 --> 10:18.840
but so is Hector.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.760
Turns out, we haven't discovered how
to share knowledge...

10:21.840 --> 10:24.360
-But physical sensations.
-Bingo.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.000
That's nuts. Holy shit.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.840
And even nutsier shit,

10:29.280 --> 10:33.400
Hector felt the burn,
but took no damage at all.

10:33.480 --> 10:37.280
All of the experience,
none of the physical cost.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.960
But how did he die?

10:39.640 --> 10:41.760
They cut him open after
to see if he was OK.

10:41.840 --> 10:42.880
Oh.

10:42.960 --> 10:48.240
Anyhow, thanks to Hector's sacrifice,
we prototyped this.

10:54.600 --> 10:58.920
A receiver for human experiences.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.360
A neural implant. Only one of its kind.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.960
This is why you brought me up here.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.560
What's the biggest pain in the ass
with patients?

11:10.760 --> 11:13.000
Finding out what's wrong with them
in the first place.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.880
Half of the assholes that roll in here
can't even describe their symptoms.

11:16.960 --> 11:20.960
They're-- They're out cold or concussed
or drunk or dumb

11:21.040 --> 11:24.120
or... two years old,
or they can't speak English.

11:26.120 --> 11:31.960
Imagine if you could feel
exactly what a patient feels,

11:32.040 --> 11:35.000
minus the physical consequences.

11:35.080 --> 11:37.080
Like reading their minds.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.800
So what do you say?

11:40.880 --> 11:44.080
Gotta hand it to Dawson,
he lept at the chance.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.920
Like, he was happy to do it.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.560
-[machine beeps steadily]
-And it was only a short procedure.

11:48.640 --> 11:52.760
Irreversible, but, hey, he was a pioneer.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.400
Plus, his mortality rates were
in the toilet,

11:56.800 --> 11:59.160
so this was his best shot at redemption.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.480
Does it hurt if I touch it?

12:06.560 --> 12:08.560
I don't think so.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.800
-[chuckles]
-There's something kinda kinky about it.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.440
It's like the ultimate piercing.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.280
If you're trying to make me feel better,
it's working.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.560
-[woman chuckles]
-Time for the trial run.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.880
[Rolo] So this is where
our hairnet doohickey comes into play.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.840
Theory was, if you slipped it
on a willing subject,

12:29.920 --> 12:35.640
it'd absorb their physical sensations
and relay them to Dawson's implant.

12:35.720 --> 12:38.720
We just had to find out if it worked.

12:41.240 --> 12:42.080
[Dawson gasps]

12:42.680 --> 12:44.000
Ow.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.280
This one.

12:48.040 --> 12:51.320
Houston, we got a miracle.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.360
[Rolo]  Right off the bat,

12:53.440 --> 12:55.280
Dawson gets to work
with the ailing public,

12:55.360 --> 12:58.680
starts building up a kind of
mental library of physical symptoms.

12:58.760 --> 13:03.840
Plan was, he'd get to know how things felt
so that he could diagnose them quicker.

13:03.920 --> 13:08.920
So, starts small in the ER,
minor fractures, that sort of thing.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.200
Soon graduates to bigger stuff.

13:11.280 --> 13:13.880
Major injuries. Diseases.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.560
Late-stage terminal stuff.

13:16.640 --> 13:21.600
Dawson grit his teeth
and went through it all.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.640
Say a kid comes in obviously in pain.

13:24.720 --> 13:28.760
Doctors suspect appendicitis, they'd
hook him up to Dawson just to be sure.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.520
Dawson had felt appendicitis
many times by now,

13:31.600 --> 13:34.040
so he knows if it's something more.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.640
Caught things
they weren't even looking for.

13:36.720 --> 13:38.480
Blastomas and so on.

13:38.560 --> 13:39.560
Good luck, man.

13:39.640 --> 13:43.680
That man saved lives, no doubt about it.

13:43.760 --> 13:44.760
-Good luck, huh?
-Bye.

13:44.840 --> 13:47.000
-Stay in touch. Bye-bye.
-Bye.

13:47.640 --> 13:48.680
-[sighs]
-That was nice.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.200
[Rolo]  And, incidentally,

13:50.280 --> 13:52.680
if you'll allow me to be crude,

13:52.760 --> 13:57.280
Dawson's symphatic diagnoser
came in handy in the bedroom.

13:58.200 --> 14:02.040
His implant received
pleasurable sensations, too.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.760
[both panting]

14:04.520 --> 14:07.360
So if his girlfriend slipped on
that transmitting blue hairnet

14:07.440 --> 14:09.960
and he tuned in
his little implant nubbin...

14:11.120 --> 14:12.800
he didn't just feel what he was feeling...

14:12.880 --> 14:16.680
-I'm gonna come!
-...but also felt what she was feeling.

14:16.760 --> 14:22.960
Son of a bitch was experiencing
male and female orgasms at the same time.

14:23.040 --> 14:26.200
Oh, my... Oh, my...
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

14:26.280 --> 14:29.080
-[both gasping, panting]
-Oh, shit.

14:31.480 --> 14:32.840
I can't get enough of your...

14:32.920 --> 14:34.000
But?

14:34.080 --> 14:36.600
-I'm sorry?
-Dawson's having a great time.

14:36.680 --> 14:38.720
-There's gotta be a "but."
-Oh.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.520
He's having a great time, but...

14:42.000 --> 14:43.200
But...

14:44.400 --> 14:47.000
-Coming through. Coming through.
-[chattering]

14:47.640 --> 14:49.200
-[man] Come on.
-[man 2] Almost there.

14:50.280 --> 14:53.080
[Rolo]  One day,
they rush in Senator Whitley.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.680
He'd collapsed at some fundraiser.

14:55.760 --> 14:58.160
No one could tell
what in hell was wrong with him.

14:58.240 --> 15:00.520
-[woman] Lift.
-I got this.

15:00.600 --> 15:02.200
[Rolo]  Dawson's hooked up.

15:02.720 --> 15:04.760
-[woman] Be careful.
-OK.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.120
[groans]

15:06.200 --> 15:09.080
-Jeez. [groans]
- [Rolo]  And has the roughest ride.

15:09.160 --> 15:12.200
-Pete?
-Like he's got no clue what this is.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.240
-Pete?
-Just one more minute, please.

15:14.320 --> 15:16.200
-Let the man work.
-[Dawson grunts]

15:16.280 --> 15:19.800
-[Rolo]  It's a pain he's never known.
-[grunts, gasps]

15:19.880 --> 15:21.880
-Pete, he's flatlining.
-Just one more moment.

15:21.960 --> 15:23.080
And then it happened.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.000
[flatline tone]

15:30.840 --> 15:32.240
[distorted] Pete?

15:34.560 --> 15:37.000
[flatline tone continues]

15:37.080 --> 15:40.400
Dawson blacked out,
for, like, five minutes.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.640
Turns out the senator had been poisoned,

15:42.720 --> 15:45.040
a rare poison at that,
some kind of Russian shit.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.000
He'd been into that whole thing.

15:47.080 --> 15:50.600
But Dawson had experienced death
and come out the other side.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.280
[gasping]

15:52.400 --> 15:58.640
At the moment of death, a whole galaxy
of synapses fritzes out of existence.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.920
Tsunami of endorphins.

16:01.000 --> 16:05.000
And then there's this rolling dark wave
of nothing rushes in behind.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.920
When he came round,
they ran every kind of test

16:07.000 --> 16:08.760
and he was all systems go, nothing wrong.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.400
"Shaken but unharmed,"
they put on his report.

16:11.480 --> 16:14.120
Next day, he was back up and at 'em.

16:14.200 --> 16:16.000
But there was something wrong, right?

16:16.080 --> 16:18.560
To go through all that without dying?

16:18.640 --> 16:20.160
Fucked up his implant like that.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.440
[snaps fingers]

16:21.520 --> 16:22.520
[clears throat]

16:25.640 --> 16:26.600
[exhales]

16:27.160 --> 16:28.680
Oh, my God.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.000
-[woman panting]
-[sighs]

16:33.800 --> 16:35.960
-I'm just gonna get some water.
-OK.

16:40.000 --> 16:42.840
-[woman cries out] Oh, goddamn it.
-[gasping]

16:45.960 --> 16:49.600
[Rolo]  Fair to say his relationship
with pain had shifted a little.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.000
Ah, that hurt like hell.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.640
Now, he was into it.

16:56.760 --> 17:00.200
He really threw himself into his work
after that.

17:01.720 --> 17:05.560
He tried to hide it at first,
but thanks to that little nubbin,

17:05.640 --> 17:09.240
the more pain he felt,
the more pleasure he got.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.839
-[slapping]
-[woman yelps]

17:12.920 --> 17:14.160
[Dawson grunting]

17:15.480 --> 17:17.118
OK, no. Stop, stop.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.440
Stop. OK, safe word. Stop!

17:20.079 --> 17:21.400
[gasping]

17:25.599 --> 17:27.839
-You said that we could try it.
-And we did.

17:28.358 --> 17:31.280
Look, we tried the hair pulling
and that choke thing.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.200
I'm not into it, OK? It's just not me.

17:35.920 --> 17:37.120
[Dawson sighs]

17:38.160 --> 17:39.840
[Dawson panting]

17:42.120 --> 17:43.400
Maybe I should go.

17:44.640 --> 17:46.640
No. No, please.

17:47.440 --> 17:48.600
I'm sorry.

17:49.560 --> 17:51.880
Stay. Please?

18:01.600 --> 18:03.840
[moaning]

18:05.920 --> 18:08.000
-Ow. Pete!
-[loud moan]

18:13.360 --> 18:14.600
I'm going.

18:15.960 --> 18:18.000
[Rolo]  See, it's like eating chilies.

18:18.080 --> 18:19.840
You acclimatize fast.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.360
First time you had a jalapeno,
bet you spat it out, too hot.

18:23.440 --> 18:26.440
But persevere and it becomes addictive.

18:26.520 --> 18:28.600
Soon, a jalapeno's not enough.

18:28.680 --> 18:31.120
You work your way up, red-hot chilies,
bird's-eye chilies,

18:31.200 --> 18:34.160
till you get to them Scotch bonnet devils.

18:34.240 --> 18:37.000
Dawson's craving was just the same.

18:37.360 --> 18:39.440
Before you know it,
he's hanging around the ER

18:39.520 --> 18:42.680
just waiting for a juicy accident victim
to latch onto.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.240
All he can think about
is that next hit gnawing away up there.

18:45.320 --> 18:47.680
"Give it back to me. Give it back.
I gotta have it back."

18:48.840 --> 18:51.640
Sarah, will you just, um,
file these for me?

18:51.720 --> 18:52.760
-[Sarah] Sure thing.
-Pete.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.560
-This isn't your shift.
-[man] Take him round to bay four.

18:56.640 --> 18:57.960
-[man 2] OK.
-[Dawson] I just...

18:58.360 --> 18:59.280
Pete.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.600
Careful.

19:03.840 --> 19:06.040
And three, two, one.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.120
Lift.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.440
[woman] Let me get this.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.560
-[Rolo]  Soon as he jacks in, he feels it.
-[Dawson gasps]

19:14.680 --> 19:17.120
It's a cardiac arrest.
She collapsed in the street.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.800
I just wanna be sure.

19:18.880 --> 19:22.560
It's a heart attack all right,
but he says nothing.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.840
Plays for time.

19:24.920 --> 19:26.920
[exhales]

19:27.120 --> 19:32.640
Figures he can ride that pain train
all the way through to nirvana.

19:36.600 --> 19:40.080
Eventually they have to physically
pull Dawson away from her.

19:40.160 --> 19:42.880
-[gasps, grunts]
-[flatline tone]

19:42.960 --> 19:45.480
[Rolo]  Give Aunt Ethel her CPR.

19:45.560 --> 19:48.880
She flatlines in front of him,
and he's like an alcoholic

19:48.960 --> 19:52.640
watching someone pour
a glass of good Scotch down the sink,

19:52.720 --> 19:55.600
sick at the waste of good shit.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.920
Look, we always knew going into this
there might be side effects.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.080
I mean, we can look into how we
deactivate, but it's gonna take some time.

20:04.160 --> 20:07.000
I can't just pull all the people
off the other projects, Pete.

20:07.080 --> 20:10.760
I mean, we have milestones to hit.
You know the drill.

20:12.320 --> 20:13.520
But we'll get there.

20:15.800 --> 20:17.760
In the meantime,
we can't have you near patients,

20:18.240 --> 20:23.520
so just go home, put your feet up
and binge a miniseries, whatever.

20:24.560 --> 20:27.960
No one could have known
what'd happen next.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.200
[reporter]
Authorities are expected to confirm

20:30.280 --> 20:35.440
the body is that of missing
WNL weather reporter Denise Stockley.

20:35.520 --> 20:38.840
Certainly a major police presence there,
as we can see.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.480
Let's take a look at the timeline...

20:40.560 --> 20:47.320
[Rolo]  Dawson was home alone 24/7,
climbing the walls. Withdrawal, I guess.

20:54.280 --> 20:58.200
[reporter]  She was last seen
the evening of Friday, September 15th...

20:59.480 --> 21:03.960
[Rolo]  He didn't have patients
to leech pain off anymore.

21:05.120 --> 21:10.560
So he started inflicting it... on himself.

21:19.640 --> 21:20.640
[yelps]

21:22.520 --> 21:24.400
-[exhales]
-[reporter]  ...for her safe return,

21:24.480 --> 21:27.560
or for any information from witnesses...

21:28.160 --> 21:32.040
[Rolo]  Spent a week
just whittling away at himself.

21:32.960 --> 21:35.800
Cut here, a gouge there.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.240
I mean, the guy was a doctor.

21:38.320 --> 21:41.360
He knew how far he could go
without it getting fatal.

21:41.960 --> 21:44.640
[soft gasps, crunching]

21:47.240 --> 21:48.080
[Dawson grunts]

21:59.600 --> 22:01.160
[Rolo]  But it was never enough.

22:06.680 --> 22:08.360
None of it was enough.

22:10.520 --> 22:15.560
When he worked on himself,
there was a crucial ingredient missing.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.080
Fear.

22:20.480 --> 22:22.040
[gasps]

22:22.120 --> 22:23.240
The amygdala.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.480
Little almond-shaped nubbin in your brain.

22:25.560 --> 22:29.720
When you're afraid, it lights up like
a midnight airstrike, sharpens the senses.

22:29.800 --> 22:35.040
The fear the patient feels when
they're staring up at that ceiling light,

22:35.120 --> 22:39.840
the fear accompanying
each sudden jab of agony,

22:39.920 --> 22:41.880
he'd come to appreciate that, too.

22:41.960 --> 22:45.680
It went with the pain.

22:45.760 --> 22:48.720
Complemented it, like red wine and steak.

22:48.800 --> 22:53.640
You can inflict pain on yourself,
but not terror.

22:55.480 --> 22:59.240
For that, you need a volunteer.

23:38.400 --> 23:40.320
[screams]

23:49.440 --> 23:51.080
[whirring]

23:51.160 --> 23:52.440

23:53.760 --> 23:56.000
[man shrieking]

23:56.120 --> 23:57.320
[siren wails]

24:00.360 --> 24:03.440
[grunts]

24:03.520 --> 24:07.200
Dawson was practically coming
when they found him.

24:07.520 --> 24:13.000
He'd enjoyed one big old speedball
of fear and pain and death.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.640
Tell me they put him in jail.

24:16.120 --> 24:17.440
In the hospital.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.200
He wound up in a vegetative state.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.000
Good.

24:22.400 --> 24:24.440
Still there to this day.

24:24.520 --> 24:27.080
In a coma, deep as the ocean.

24:27.160 --> 24:32.160
But the thing of it is, they say
he still has that look on his face.

24:33.520 --> 24:34.760
Blissed out.

24:35.440 --> 24:39.000
Still riding that high.

24:44.480 --> 24:49.000
-You're fucking with me, right? [scoffs]
-OK, I added the boner. I couldn't resist.

24:49.560 --> 24:52.480
-Fun story, huh?
-Yep, fun story.

24:53.440 --> 24:54.440
Ooh!

24:59.440 --> 25:00.440
Oh, man.

25:01.480 --> 25:02.720
Do you want some water?

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
-Really, I'm fine.
-No, man, it's no bother.

25:07.120 --> 25:08.320
Thank you kindly.

25:15.160 --> 25:18.240
-[exhales]
-So, how come you didn't stay in med tech?

25:18.640 --> 25:19.880
Well, I did for a while.

25:19.960 --> 25:23.920
Just 'cause Dawson went la-la,
neuro research didn't stop.

25:33.800 --> 25:34.800
[sighs]

25:34.880 --> 25:36.960
TCKR adapted it and fine-tuned it.

25:37.040 --> 25:41.480
It's how they wound up with
the digital consciousness transference,

25:41.560 --> 25:43.200
what they call cookies today.

25:43.280 --> 25:46.640
Uh, like when they upload old people
to the cloud?

25:47.000 --> 25:48.520
Yeah, but this was way before that.

25:48.600 --> 25:52.000
We didn't have that whole immersive
VR environment shizzle back then.

25:52.080 --> 25:57.200
What we dealt with was more organic,
almost lo-fi.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.480
How so?

25:59.480 --> 26:03.000
Gotta say you ask more questions
than the average bear.

26:03.080 --> 26:07.360
Well, to be honest, my car's still
charging, so I've got a bit of time.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.480
Well, then,
what I wanted to show you, um...

26:13.920 --> 26:15.560
Part of what I was working on...

26:18.120 --> 26:21.200
It's, um... cute?

26:21.280 --> 26:24.320
Actually, one of the saddest things
in the whole place.

26:24.920 --> 26:25.920
Doesn't look it.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.520
You ever had one of those relationships

26:27.600 --> 26:31.360
where you just can't get someone
out of your head?

26:32.400 --> 26:36.040
-Yeah.
-Some years back, boy meets girl.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.520
Boy's called Jack, girl's called...

26:38.600 --> 26:41.200
-Jill.
-Carrie.

28:12.960 --> 28:15.600
Jack visits her every week, talks to her,

28:15.680 --> 28:19.520
plays her recordings of their son,
shoots the shit.

28:20.560 --> 28:21.920
She never wakes up.

28:22.680 --> 28:25.880
But they tested the comm box on her.

28:25.960 --> 28:31.240

sort of respond back.

I got you some room fresheners.
You want pine forest?

28:37.880 --> 28:39.080
OK.

What about citrus fresh?

28:44.440 --> 28:45.440
Gotcha.

28:46.080 --> 28:49.120
And I recorded Parker singing
with some other kids.

28:49.480 --> 28:50.960
Uh, you wanna hear it?

29:02.640 --> 29:03.600
[Rolo] Hey.

29:04.360 --> 29:07.720
-Hey.
-The woman in 302, Carrie Lamasse.

29:07.800 --> 29:09.960
You're the partner, right?

29:10.840 --> 29:12.160
-Uh-huh.
-Jack?

29:12.640 --> 29:15.760
Rolo Haynes.
I represent neuro R&D for TCKR.

29:15.840 --> 29:16.840
OK.

29:16.920 --> 29:20.080
We're working on a project that might be
of interest to someone in your position.

29:21.160 --> 29:22.640
What's... What's my position?

29:23.360 --> 29:25.960
We're exploring something
that could give the likes of Carrie

29:26.040 --> 29:27.840
a whole new lease of life.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.640
I'm talking miraculous.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.560
What do you mean?

29:33.640 --> 29:35.400
So the guys at TCKR have been working

29:35.480 --> 29:39.480
on digitally extracting a consciousness
out of one brain

29:39.560 --> 29:42.640
and kind of rehousing it in a host brain.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.760
-What does that even mean?
-OK.

29:46.840 --> 29:50.480
So, even on a good day,
we only use 40% of our brain capacity.

29:50.560 --> 29:52.640
There is this whole other
60% of our noggin

29:52.720 --> 29:54.720
hanging around like an empty Airbnb.

29:54.800 --> 29:55.800
And so...?

29:55.880 --> 29:58.760
And so with our new
compression technique,

29:58.840 --> 30:04.640
we figure we can fit another whole
consciousness into that unused space.

30:05.880 --> 30:10.560
I'm talking about taking Carrie's
consciousness from that broken shell

30:11.600 --> 30:12.680
and putting it in there.

30:14.520 --> 30:18.520
What? Um... Like a voice inside my head?

30:19.160 --> 30:21.200
Like the whole of her inside your head.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.680
Like a hitchhiker. Like a passenger.

30:23.760 --> 30:26.720
Vicarious sensations.
She sees what you see.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.600
She feels what you feel.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.800
She can live again.

30:31.760 --> 30:35.600
-"Feels" as in...?
-You got a little boy. Parker.

30:36.080 --> 30:40.640
-How do you know all this?
-You hug Parker and Carrie feels it too.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.640
She can hug your son via you.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.840
How much does this all cost?

30:49.920 --> 30:51.480
Won't cost a thing.

30:51.560 --> 30:55.120
We will have to euthanize her physical
body during the transfer process,

30:55.200 --> 30:59.400
but we would earmark her organs
for transplants.

31:00.760 --> 31:02.520
Giving back to the community.

31:08.280 --> 31:09.640
So what do you say?

31:10.240 --> 31:11.720
I'd have to think about it.

31:14.200 --> 31:15.680
Carrie's done her thinking.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.240

Oh, God.

So long since I tasted anything.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.480
You can taste that?

33:16.680 --> 33:18.840
She tastes it. Holy shit.

33:20.240 --> 33:21.800
Looks like you're all set.

34:07.720 --> 34:09.159
Truly heartwarming.

34:09.520 --> 34:12.800
Yeah. But this is where you say "but."

I'm not being unreasonable.

No, just wait. No. Just--
Just hear me out.

into the back seat

No privacy for him. No agency for her.

-Exactly.

Hey, guys, I see the problem.

36:46.280 --> 36:47.280
She's the problem.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.320
Familiarity breeding contempt
is the problem.

36:50.400 --> 36:52.520
You need to ration your contact.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.760
Ration how? She's running through my
head like a goddamn tune I can't shake.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.880
Well, we could upgrade
your privileges, Jack.

37:00.520 --> 37:01.960
Give you a little more control.

37:03.280 --> 37:05.720
Shut up! Sorry. Go on.

37:05.800 --> 37:08.920
Well, maybe if you had the ability

37:09.000 --> 37:13.120
to place Carrie on pause now and then...

37:14.760 --> 37:17.000
it'd make things easier
for the both of you.

37:17.800 --> 37:18.720
Do it.

37:20.120 --> 37:23.200
Whatever. Whatever. Whatever. Do it.

37:23.280 --> 37:24.760
[Rolo]  So he upped his privileges.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.800
-Should be able to put her on pause.
-This one?

37:26.880 --> 37:27.960
-That's it.
-OK.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.040
Didn't take him long to use 'em.

37:47.880 --> 37:51.080

checking out women's racks?

37:53.880 --> 37:58.400
And don't say you weren't because
I can feel the fucking boner forming, OK?

38:00.600 --> 38:04.280
And he checks her ass too as she leaves.
Holy fuck.

38:05.880 --> 38:07.200
So I checked her out. What?

38:07.280 --> 38:10.480
I'm horny as fuck,
haven't jerked off in, like, a month.

38:10.560 --> 38:12.360
Well, I'm not stopping you.

38:12.440 --> 38:14.840
You're looking over my shoulder
but from the inside.

38:14.920 --> 38:17.840
It's like trying to jerk off
in front of a cop who's also your mom.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.760
-Fuck you!
-OK, you know what?

38:19.840 --> 38:22.520
That's it. That's it. That's it. Time out.
I'm putting you on pause.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.880
No. Jack, don't you dare.

38:24.960 --> 38:27.600
Jack. Jack, I'm warning you.

38:30.600 --> 38:32.400
Not cool.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.880
Don't do that again.

38:55.400 --> 38:57.040
Uh, just a few weeks.

38:58.640 --> 39:00.320
I don't know. Eight?

39:03.360 --> 39:06.480
OK, I know. I'm... I'm sorry.

39:06.880 --> 39:09.600
I know. I'm sorry. I felt really bad.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.480
So, um, I got you this.

39:15.120 --> 39:17.880
Figured it's kind of our anniversary, so--

39:17.960 --> 39:20.440
Fuck you. You're a fucking asshole.

-Your favorite.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.840
I wanna see Parker.
You had him away from me for months.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.920
I wanna see my boy.

39:33.040 --> 39:33.920
OK.

39:35.000 --> 39:35.960
OK.

39:38.920 --> 39:40.320

39:47.960 --> 39:49.720
[Jack] What you got going on there?

39:50.440 --> 39:52.400
-Is that a fire truck?
-Yeah.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.120
Tell him I love him.

39:57.880 --> 40:00.400
Hey, buddy, Mommy loves you.

40:00.480 --> 40:01.480
What?

40:04.440 --> 40:07.320
-Tell him I need a hug.
-[Jack] You wanna know something else?

40:09.320 --> 40:11.720
Mommy needs a hug. Hmm?

40:15.640 --> 40:17.240
Oh, God!

40:21.640 --> 40:25.040
[Rolo]  Parker complicated things.

40:26.240 --> 40:30.920
They both felt responsibility for him,
so they tried to compromise,

40:31.000 --> 40:33.920
you know, reach an agreement, like adults.

40:34.000 --> 40:38.200
Jack put Carrie on pause
except for the weekends,

40:39.120 --> 40:41.360
when they'd take Parker out
with Carrie in attendance,

40:41.440 --> 40:44.400
kind of like a divorcee
with visiting rights.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.680

-[Jack] That's it!

-[Jack] You tricked me.

-[Parker growls]
-[Jack] Aah!

41:02.400 --> 41:04.840
-[Jack] OK.
-[Parker] Come down here.

41:04.960 --> 41:05.960
[Jack] I'm coming.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.960
[sounds speeding up, overlapping]

41:17.320 --> 41:18.840
[Rolo]  It worked OK.

41:20.240 --> 41:21.360
For a while.

41:24.480 --> 41:25.360
Hey.

41:26.360 --> 41:27.560
Looks like we're neighbors.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.880
-I've just moved in.
-Uh...

41:29.960 --> 41:32.200
-Emily.
-Jack. Nice to meet you.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.240
Oh, please.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.400
Hey.

41:36.480 --> 41:37.840
Oh!

41:37.920 --> 41:40.160
-Who's this?
-It's Parker.

41:40.240 --> 41:41.360
Cool name.

41:42.400 --> 41:43.760
Guess I'll see you around.

41:44.480 --> 41:45.400
Yeah.

41:46.560 --> 41:48.520
Guess I'll see you around.

41:48.600 --> 41:50.280
[Jack] She was nice, OK?

41:50.360 --> 41:54.360
[Carrie] Oh, cut the shit. I know
when your hormones are flowing, OK?

41:54.440 --> 41:57.600
Our balls are brewing up a blow load
as we speak.

41:57.680 --> 41:59.680
I can't. I'm with our son.

42:01.360 --> 42:03.680
[stammers] I didn't hit on anyone.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.800
You know what? Fuck it.
Visiting time is over.

42:06.880 --> 42:09.520
No. Jack, don't you dare. Jack.

42:09.600 --> 42:10.880
Jack, you son of a bi--

42:12.400 --> 42:13.840
Parker, wait up.

42:13.920 --> 42:19.880
Anyhow, as time passed by,
Jack got it on with the neighbor.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.440
And Carrie didn't take it so good.

42:26.560 --> 42:29.280
She works all week. We just wanted
to spend a weekend together.

42:29.360 --> 42:31.320
Jesus, can't you just be happy for us?

42:31.400 --> 42:34.200
No, Jack, weirdly enough, I can't.

42:34.280 --> 42:36.680
Christ, you are so bitter.

42:37.520 --> 42:38.720
No. Why?

42:41.440 --> 42:43.560
-Is she giving you shit?
-Mnh-mnh.

42:44.320 --> 42:46.360
Carrie, stop giving him shit.

42:46.960 --> 42:48.600
Tell her to back off.

42:49.600 --> 42:51.160
-I--
-Tell her.

42:51.240 --> 42:52.960
Jesus Christ.

42:57.440 --> 42:59.880
So the weekend thing isn't working.

42:59.960 --> 43:01.600
And we tried limiting her to an hour--

43:01.680 --> 43:05.760
But you can tell that she's in there,
like that judging and bitching.

43:05.840 --> 43:08.000
The time frame is frustrating for Carrie.

43:08.080 --> 43:10.360
Carrie is frustrating for us.

43:14.760 --> 43:17.360
You got Carrie on pause now?

43:19.600 --> 43:21.160
OK, well...

43:23.040 --> 43:24.800
there's always deletion.

43:26.840 --> 43:29.400
-As in...?
-As in permanent erasure.

43:29.480 --> 43:30.840
-Uh-huh.
-No.

43:31.560 --> 43:34.840
-That'd... That'd be killing her.
-Not legally.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.120
But ethically.

43:36.200 --> 43:39.320
Please. She is just some leftover code
in your head.

43:39.400 --> 43:42.280
It'll be like... like deleting an email.

43:42.360 --> 43:43.360
No.

43:44.480 --> 43:46.680
No. No deletion. I'm not doing it.

43:46.760 --> 43:49.600
She wants to be near Parker.
I can't take that away from her.

43:49.680 --> 43:51.600
There's gotta be something you can do.

43:53.480 --> 43:54.920
My friends...

43:57.040 --> 43:58.200
you're in luck.

44:00.320 --> 44:02.360
It's something we're beta testing.

44:02.440 --> 44:04.480
It's actually aimed
at terminally ill parents.

44:04.800 --> 44:07.720
Kind of like a souvenir for their kids.

44:08.400 --> 44:09.560
Here.

44:10.360 --> 44:11.680
A monkey?

44:11.760 --> 44:13.320
More like a keepsake.

44:14.080 --> 44:15.200
We can put her in here.

44:15.280 --> 44:16.480
In there?

44:16.560 --> 44:18.160
Uh-huh. It's...

44:18.240 --> 44:19.840
It has a consciousness receptor,

44:19.920 --> 44:23.560
kind of like the one we put in your head,
but a prototype.

44:23.640 --> 44:28.320
And there's a camera here
so she can see Parker.

44:28.400 --> 44:30.600
Plus the whole body's got haptic feedback,

44:30.680 --> 44:34.040
so if little Parkie gives it a cuddle,
she'll feel it.

44:34.120 --> 44:36.280
And she can communicate back,

44:36.360 --> 44:39.960
but in a kid-friendly, controlled way.

44:42.520 --> 44:45.360
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm gonna have to think about it.

44:46.360 --> 44:47.960
I say yes.

44:50.760 --> 44:54.440
Well, she's done her thinking.
How about you?

44:57.440 --> 44:59.400
The transfer went pretty fast.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.560
Carrie wouldn't have even been aware
it was happening.

45:03.800 --> 45:04.800
Till she woke up.

45:06.080 --> 45:08.800
[Jack] Come on, buddy, you gotta tear it.
Tear into that thing.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.160
-[Carrie] Jack?
-[Jack] You almost got it.

45:11.760 --> 45:13.840
[laughs] There you go.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.400
All right, pull it out.

45:15.720 --> 45:17.960
Oh. There you go.

45:18.600 --> 45:19.880
What is it, Parker?

45:19.960 --> 45:21.240
[chuckles]

45:22.280 --> 45:23.400
[Parker] Monkey.

45:23.480 --> 45:24.480
What?

45:27.040 --> 45:28.400
[Jack] That's pretty cool, huh?

45:31.120 --> 45:33.400
Jack. Jack, what the fuck?

45:34.080 --> 45:35.360
[Jack] But you know something?

45:36.320 --> 45:42.080
This... This, uh...
This is a very special monkey.

45:43.000 --> 45:45.320
-Mom wanted you to have it.
-What?

45:45.400 --> 45:50.040
Every time you hug it, Mom will know,
and she'll feel that hug too.

45:50.120 --> 45:53.640
No. No, no, Jack, Jack,
put me back in your fucking head.

45:53.720 --> 45:54.760
Jack!

45:54.840 --> 45:57.000
[Jack] And this monkey can speak to you.

45:57.080 --> 45:59.200
It can let you know how it feels.

46:00.160 --> 46:01.440
How did she speak?

46:02.480 --> 46:06.120
Well, the comm setup
was a little rudimentary.

46:07.760 --> 46:09.520
I mean, this is a prototype.

46:10.080 --> 46:12.360
Jack! [sobbing]

46:12.440 --> 46:13.400
No.

46:24.720 --> 46:26.000
[woman's voice]  Monkey loves you.

46:27.240 --> 46:28.240
What was that?

46:33.480 --> 46:35.520
[woman's voice]  Monkey needs a hug.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.280
Give monkey a hug.

46:41.040 --> 46:42.600
Monkey loves you.

46:44.600 --> 46:47.280
Monkey needs a hug.
Monkey loves you. Monkey loves you.

46:47.800 --> 46:50.320
Monkey loves you. Monkey... Monkey...
Monkey needs a hug.

46:50.400 --> 46:52.920
-Yeah, I think...
-Monkey loves you.

46:53.000 --> 46:54.680
-Monkey... Monkey needs a hug.
-[sobs]

46:54.760 --> 46:58.840
Monkey just needs a minute
to get used to how things are gonna be.

46:58.920 --> 47:00.640
[sobs]

47:08.800 --> 47:11.920
Now, listen, you fucking bitch.

47:12.000 --> 47:14.200
We can still have you wiped.

47:14.640 --> 47:15.920
That what you want?

47:19.120 --> 47:21.120
Do "monkey needs a hug" for no.

47:24.320 --> 47:26.000
Monkey needs a hug.

47:26.960 --> 47:28.640
Are you gonna be a good toy?

47:31.600 --> 47:34.240
Are you gonna be a good toy?

47:36.200 --> 47:37.760
Monkey loves you.

47:38.120 --> 47:39.320
You better.

47:42.040 --> 47:47.520
[Rolo]  Anyhow, in the end,
Parker got tired of his new toy.

47:48.120 --> 47:49.400
But that's kids.

47:50.320 --> 47:52.320
They're ingrates.

48:02.000 --> 48:02.960
[door slams]

48:03.920 --> 48:05.920
Monkey needs a hug.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
[Nish]  Whoa.

48:08.400 --> 48:11.720
Wait, so this is a crime museum.

48:11.800 --> 48:17.200
-Where's the crime in this?
-Well, the monkey is the crime.

48:17.280 --> 48:18.880
See, a couple of years back,

48:18.960 --> 48:21.000
the UN made it illegal

48:21.080 --> 48:25.240
to transfer human consciousnesses
into limited formats like this.

48:25.320 --> 48:30.440
Gotta be able to express at least five
emotions for it to be humane, apparently.

48:30.520 --> 48:31.520
[chuckles]

48:31.600 --> 48:34.480
Human rights for cookies. Right, Carrie?

48:34.560 --> 48:36.560
Monkey needs a hug.

48:37.320 --> 48:38.480
She's still in there?

48:38.560 --> 48:40.920
It'd be illegal to delete her too,
so, yeah.

48:41.000 --> 48:42.600
[chuckles] Go figure.

48:42.680 --> 48:46.000
Anyhow, ACLU raised one heck of a stink,

48:46.080 --> 48:49.480
and so thanks to this son of a monkey,
I was out on my ass from TCKR.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.400
Not even a severance package.

48:52.040 --> 48:54.200
It's why I started this place.

48:54.960 --> 48:59.200
Had to branch out somehow, and it
appealed to the carny in me, I guess.

49:04.160 --> 49:05.760
Monkey needs a hug.

49:05.840 --> 49:08.880
Goddamn AC's still not working.
Ooh, it's hot.

49:12.880 --> 49:15.360
But I've kept you waiting too long.

49:16.200 --> 49:17.080
[clears throat]

49:17.160 --> 49:21.480
You ready for the prime exhibit?
Step right this way.

49:22.560 --> 49:27.520
Listen, I gotta warn you,
he's not the man he once-- [coughs]

49:27.600 --> 49:28.480
...was.

49:28.560 --> 49:30.760
-[clears throat] Sorry.
-Do you want some more water?

49:31.760 --> 49:33.360
I'm fine. [sighs]

49:34.360 --> 49:35.600
He's this way.

49:36.400 --> 49:38.400
Ooh. [panting]

49:41.000 --> 49:43.760
[Rolo] Come on, mister! [snaps fingers]
You got a visitor.

49:43.840 --> 49:44.840
[knocks on glass]

49:46.480 --> 49:51.520
May I present Clayton Leigh,
weather girl killer. [coughs]

49:52.040 --> 49:54.840
I know, he's kind of mopey these days.

49:55.800 --> 49:58.440
Cuts kind of a pathetic figure.

49:59.000 --> 50:00.920
But don't feel too sorry for him.

50:01.000 --> 50:03.960
He is a convicted murderer.

50:07.480 --> 50:10.480
Lest we forget Denise Stockley.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.480
Tragic and cute.

50:12.560 --> 50:14.560
Ain't that right, Clayton?

50:15.560 --> 50:17.040
Coo-ee!

50:20.920 --> 50:23.560
He's actually looking at you.

50:23.640 --> 50:26.160
Look out. Maybe you're his type.

50:27.960 --> 50:29.160
He looks so real.

50:29.240 --> 50:33.480
[Rolo] Well, it is him,
or a fully conscious upload of him.

50:34.560 --> 50:37.640
You're probably wondering
how he got in here.

50:38.000 --> 50:43.280
After TCKR kicked me out, my plan was to
branch out into celebrity consciousnesses,

50:43.360 --> 50:47.000
sign up famous people and reincarnate
them as holograms after they die.

50:47.080 --> 50:50.960
Kind of like a living Madame Tussauds.

50:51.040 --> 50:54.800
But celebrities, that's just a quagmire.

50:55.280 --> 50:58.720
Too many rights issues,
asshole representatives.

51:01.200 --> 51:03.600
But convicted killers?

51:04.560 --> 51:06.040
It's a different story.

51:07.080 --> 51:08.480
[door buzzes]

51:28.000 --> 51:28.880
[clears throat]

51:30.640 --> 51:32.760
Mr. Leigh, allow me to introduce myself.

51:32.840 --> 51:36.680
-My name is Rolo Haynes.
-They say you're in technology.

51:37.520 --> 51:42.040
-Uh, yes, that is true.
-So you can look into this DNA thing?

51:42.120 --> 51:43.640
Prove it wasn't me?

51:43.720 --> 51:47.920
Um, yes, that's certainly a possibility,
but that's not why I'm here.

51:48.680 --> 51:50.760
-I have a proposal.
-Goodbye.

51:50.840 --> 51:53.280
No, wait. I have a proposal. I can help.

51:53.360 --> 51:55.280
I can help your family.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.640
How'd you talk him into it?

52:00.640 --> 52:02.840
He didn't need much convincing.

52:02.920 --> 52:07.560
So really it's just signing over
the rights to your digital self

52:08.040 --> 52:09.600
in case the worst happens,

52:09.680 --> 52:13.640
and I promise your relatives will
receive the lion's share of any profits.

52:13.720 --> 52:16.960
So if, you know, God forbid,

52:17.040 --> 52:19.800
you do get sent to the chair,

52:20.840 --> 52:25.160
you know your family
will be provided for, for life.

52:26.400 --> 52:29.200
-How'd his family feel about it?
-They didn't give a shit.

52:29.640 --> 52:31.840
Abandoned him
the moment he got locked up.

52:33.760 --> 52:35.160
I know, right?

52:35.240 --> 52:39.480
-Jesus Christ, Clay, it's your soul.
-Ain't no such thing.

52:40.360 --> 52:42.680
It's just a computer simulation
or somethin'.

52:42.760 --> 52:45.120
Then why does he need your permission?

52:45.880 --> 52:49.560
If my pardon comes through,
it won't matter.

52:51.240 --> 52:52.560
And if it doesn't?

52:53.120 --> 52:55.960
Then if they send me to the chair,
this is gonna pay.

52:56.320 --> 53:00.800
It's gonna keep you and the kids
above water, maintain a roof over y'all.

53:00.880 --> 53:02.000
Baby, don't.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.120
This could be a good thing.

53:08.480 --> 53:10.280
But he never did get that pardon.

53:10.360 --> 53:12.880
Shit, no, 'cause he was guilty.

53:12.960 --> 53:15.800
But wasn't there some doubt?
You know, that documentary?

53:15.880 --> 53:17.800
Fake news. Hatchet job.

53:17.880 --> 53:21.000
-What about the DNA tampering?
-Seriously?

53:21.080 --> 53:23.120
There's no doubt about it.

53:23.960 --> 53:26.080
The day he got the chair

53:26.160 --> 53:29.440
was a great day for justice.

53:33.040 --> 53:34.480
Clayton couldn't complain.

53:35.240 --> 53:37.400
I mean, he was gonna be a pioneer.

53:40.880 --> 53:45.000
I was gonna slurp up
his entire consciousness.

53:45.800 --> 53:52.560
He'd be the first guy on death row
to survive his own execution.

54:12.160 --> 54:14.280
[labored breathing]

54:16.600 --> 54:18.600
[electricity buzzes]

54:28.160 --> 54:30.640
The transfer went beautifully.

54:40.040 --> 54:44.080
Before I knew it, Clayton was born again.

54:44.920 --> 54:45.960
[Clayton gasps]

55:03.160 --> 55:04.160
Hi, buddy.

55:05.520 --> 55:07.800
Congratulations to you.

55:08.880 --> 55:11.960
You're in the afterlife, so to speak.

55:13.920 --> 55:15.080
Looking good.

55:15.160 --> 55:16.560
Am I a ghost?

55:16.640 --> 55:18.520
If that helps, yeah.

55:20.960 --> 55:24.160
I just gotta test a few things here, OK?

55:24.240 --> 55:27.560
So this may seem a little weird.
Just hang on in there.

55:30.400 --> 55:31.360
[Clayton gasps]

55:31.640 --> 55:32.840
What the fuck?

55:33.560 --> 55:38.280
See, I knew just seeing the guy
walking around captive, that was good,

55:38.360 --> 55:40.360
but that wasn't much of a draw.

55:40.440 --> 55:42.480
But pulling the lever yourself?

55:43.880 --> 55:45.560
Now, that's an attraction.

55:46.880 --> 55:48.440
-Hey!
-OK.

55:48.520 --> 55:50.640
-Hey!
-Three, two, one.

55:51.560 --> 55:53.480
[yells]

55:55.320 --> 55:57.280
Dawson's pain tech
had paved the way for it.

55:57.360 --> 55:59.840
A perfect re-creation

55:59.920 --> 56:04.800
of exactly how the agony
of electrocution feels.

56:04.880 --> 56:08.000
Every volt simulated for real.

56:08.080 --> 56:10.320
[screaming]

56:10.880 --> 56:14.720
Key was, never let him exceed 15 seconds
at max voltage.

56:14.800 --> 56:18.560
That would wipe his digital synapses
out for good, kill him.

56:22.120 --> 56:25.680
Ten seconds seemed to be
the optimum shock length,

56:25.760 --> 56:29.600
so that became the intractable limit.

56:29.680 --> 56:32.560
OK. Have a little rest.

56:32.640 --> 56:35.480
-[Clayton panting]
-Get used to your room.

56:36.400 --> 56:38.200
Official opening's tomorrow.

56:44.880 --> 56:47.200
[chattering]

56:48.640 --> 56:53.240
[Rolo]  In fact, in the early days,
the problem was fitting everyone in.

56:57.120 --> 56:59.800
Please don't do it. Please, please,
please, please, please. Please.

56:59.880 --> 57:02.080
Please don't do it. Please.

57:02.160 --> 57:03.760
[yells]

57:10.760 --> 57:15.280
But, of course, it was really
the souvenirs that were driving trade.

57:15.360 --> 57:16.760
It was beautiful.

57:16.840 --> 57:19.880
-[Clayton screaming]
-Every time you finished juicing him,

57:19.960 --> 57:22.880
out pops a conscious sentient snapshot
of Clayton,

57:23.400 --> 57:25.880
not a recording, a true copy of his mind

57:25.960 --> 57:29.680
perpetually experiencing
that beautiful pain.

57:29.760 --> 57:34.400
Stuck forever
in that one perfect moment of agony.

57:34.480 --> 57:35.920
Always on.

57:36.520 --> 57:39.160
Always suffering.

57:39.240 --> 57:41.800
-[screaming]
-And what you'd call...

57:42.640 --> 57:44.920
fun size. [chortling]

57:45.960 --> 57:49.480
[grunting, coughing]

57:56.840 --> 57:59.120
[American accent]
Take a seat if it makes it easier.

57:59.200 --> 58:01.760
[gasping breaths]

58:03.080 --> 58:05.160
[Rolo gasps, sputters]

58:09.840 --> 58:10.960
Sit down.

58:11.200 --> 58:12.360
[moaning]

58:13.760 --> 58:15.840
[panting, cries out]

58:16.840 --> 58:18.840
[stutters]

58:18.920 --> 58:22.360
What? My accent?

58:23.480 --> 58:25.400
Not fucking British.

58:27.120 --> 58:28.520
Sorry to disappoint.

58:30.960 --> 58:32.160
Who are you?

58:33.120 --> 58:36.560
You left some parts of the story out,
Mr. Haynes. Why is that?

58:36.640 --> 58:38.760
You forgot to mention the protests.

58:40.120 --> 58:43.880
His wife started a campaign,
got some momentum behind it.

58:43.960 --> 58:46.520
Guess you'd call it
virtue-signaling bullshit,

58:46.600 --> 58:48.560
but I know it hurt your attendance.

58:52.600 --> 58:55.400
And even the protesters got bored
after a while.

58:56.600 --> 59:00.040
As soon as it was clear the state wouldn't
do a damn thing about clearing him,

59:00.440 --> 59:02.760
they just moved onto
the next viral miscarriage of justice

59:02.840 --> 59:04.840
they can hang a hashtag off of.

59:06.720 --> 59:10.040
But they did their job, right?
This place was on the shit list.

59:10.440 --> 59:12.640
Who was your core clientele after that?

59:13.640 --> 59:18.600
You lost the day trippers, the tourists,
fun family crowd. Who was left?

59:18.680 --> 59:21.680
You again, you pasty-faced motherfucker?

59:21.760 --> 59:22.800
[screams]

59:23.400 --> 59:25.760
[Nish]  Loners. Sadists.

59:26.560 --> 59:28.680
The supremacist sicko demographic.

59:30.200 --> 59:32.040
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Out, out, out.

59:32.120 --> 59:34.120
[screaming, gasps]

59:35.000 --> 59:37.000
And that crowd's not big enough.

59:38.280 --> 59:39.960
They don't keep the lights on.

59:40.040 --> 59:41.720
So if someone shows up,

59:42.560 --> 59:46.400
some classic race-hate rich guy
with a hard-on for power...

59:48.080 --> 59:51.280
and he slips you some extra
for a longer time at the crank...

59:52.480 --> 59:55.000
[Clayton yells]

59:55.080 --> 59:56.480
...you take it.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.000
[yelling continues]

01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.560
[alarm blares]

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:08.080
Thank you.

01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.400
[Nish]  Wasn't the same after that, was he?

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.280
Not dead but hardly alive either.

01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:22.640
Even the perverts didn't wanna pull a...
a lever on a vegetable.

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.280
Where's the joy in that?

01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.480
But someone came to see him, right?

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.240
She saw him.

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.400
She stood on this spot.

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:42.480
Saw what you had done to him.

01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:45.360
Clay?

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.520
[Nish]  He was like a docile animal.

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.520
God knows if he even recognized her.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.920
God knows if he even recognizes me.

01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:25.960
[whispers] Dad.

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.640
Happy birthday.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.280
[cries]

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:54.560
[sniffs]

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:56.680
[gasping breaths]

01:01:57.560 --> 01:02:00.280
What my mom saw that day
was more than she could take.

01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:03.560
She had hoped during the whole fight
to clear his name, but that broke her.

01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.120
You know what she did
when she came home?

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.440
Bottle of pills and a bottle of vodka.
I found her. You fucking piece of shit.

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:11.680
[grunts]

01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.440
Whoa.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:16.680
-Is it hot?
-[moans]

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:18.520
It's humid, right? I'm sorry.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:22.280
Stupid digital AC.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:25.080
Easy to hack.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.200
Never accept drinks from strangers.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:34.800
[whirring]

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:36.640
My daddy taught me that.

01:02:39.080 --> 01:02:44.040
Going by the color of your lips,
you're gonna be gone in 30 seconds.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:51.760
-[Nish sighs, sniffles]
-[computer beeps]

01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:55.400
Hey, don't worry.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.320
We're gonna see you on the other side.

01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.280
-[device whirring]
-[Nish typing]

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.120
[gasps]

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.080
[Nish] Hey.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.280
Computer says you're awake.

01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.360
Congratulations. You're a pioneer.

01:03:23.440 --> 01:03:24.840
What the fuck did you do?

01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:27.840
It turns out that it is possible

01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:32.200
to transfer a fresh consciousness
inside a virtual one.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.160
My daddy's giving you a ride.

01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.600
Get me out of here, you fucking cun--

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.960
I'm guessing you're screaming and calling
me names right now, but I wouldn't know.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.880
-You--
-I mean, my dad can't talk, thanks to you.

01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.960
Otherwise I'm guessing
he'd pass on your goodwill messages.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.640
You fu-- You fucking bitch!
You fucking bitch!

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:55.440
In other news, you'll shortly
be undertaking another first.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:58.520
The first double-decker mercy killing.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.200
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.

01:04:00.280 --> 01:04:03.440
I took off the ten-second limit
so Daddy'll get a full hit of juice.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:06.920
Should be enough to set him free.

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:11.640
You... however...

01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.520
burrowed away inside there,
Mr. Haynes, you'll feel it all.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.080
-Hey!
-All the pain.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.240
-Fuck y--
-Every perfect little shot of it.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:22.200
-Fuck you!
-I'm getting myself a souvenir, too.

01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:23.840
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:25.720
Hey, please, please. I...

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.240
Always on.

01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:32.040
-Always suffering.
-Fuck! No, no, no.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.280
Bye, Daddy.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.240

01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:25.760
-Monkey loves you.
-Shh.

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:18.120
[yelling]

01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:27.040
How'd I do, Mom?

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:28.640
All good?

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.920
Just great, honey.

01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.760
I'm proud of you.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.880
[Nish] Aw, thanks.
