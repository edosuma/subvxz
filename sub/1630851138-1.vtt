WEBVTT

00:28.560 --> 00:29.770
- What is it?

00:29.770 --> 00:30.920
- We're being followed.

00:32.208 --> 00:33.158
- Can't see anyone.

00:34.460 --> 00:37.196
- But we're being followed just the same.

00:57.510 --> 00:58.560
- He's finished, sir.

00:59.570 --> 01:01.660
- We'll pull the sledge ourselves.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.200
- We're going on then?

01:03.200 --> 01:04.033
- Yes.

01:05.610 --> 01:07.853
- I will go on ahead. Scout a path.

01:08.890 --> 01:11.300
We cannot traverse the same
grounds without a horse.

01:11.300 --> 01:13.125
- Try to be back by nightfall.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.610
- We should turn back now.

01:18.570 --> 01:20.020
Surely we've come far enough.

01:21.430 --> 01:23.250
- We can go further.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.230
- What about the horse?

01:25.230 --> 01:26.420
- Kill it.
- But you can't just-

01:26.420 --> 01:28.238
- Do as he says.

02:17.110 --> 02:18.715
- Anything?

02:18.715 --> 02:20.944
- No. No sign of him.

02:23.210 --> 02:25.710
- We will continue at first light.

02:25.710 --> 02:26.653
Follow his trail.

02:27.870 --> 02:30.386
Perhaps we can pick him up along the way.

02:30.386 --> 02:31.253
- Or bury him.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.563
- If we must.

02:34.760 --> 02:36.210
- How much further can we go?

02:37.050 --> 02:39.430
- We will go as far as God can take us.

02:39.430 --> 02:43.060
- Master, a hundred men have died.

02:43.060 --> 02:46.280
We have not one horse left
and precious little food.

02:46.280 --> 02:47.230
How can we survive?

02:49.010 --> 02:50.123
- God will protect us.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.650
- When we return, just
think of the feasting

03:06.650 --> 03:07.960
there will be in Araunah.

03:09.687 --> 03:11.087
- There will be no feasting.

03:12.000 --> 03:12.833
- Matthew.

03:15.170 --> 03:17.480
- We're going to die here in this place.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.853
A thousand leagues from
home, and for what?

03:20.840 --> 03:22.052
That box.

03:26.420 --> 03:29.593
- Matthew, our reward
comes in the next world.

03:31.880 --> 03:33.400
Eternal life in the Kingdom of Heaven.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.550
- If I'm to die for that thing,

03:35.550 --> 03:37.090
I at least want to know what it holds!

03:47.840 --> 03:48.903
- Sit down, Matthew.

03:52.264 --> 03:53.730
It is not for you to know.

03:57.498 --> 03:58.917
- Forgive me, Master. I forget myself.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.233
- Soon it will all be completed.

04:22.042 --> 04:23.690
- Do you really think we'll die out here?

04:26.447 --> 04:27.780
- Do you really think the grandmaster

04:27.780 --> 04:29.303
sent us out here just to die?

04:37.742 --> 04:39.003
What do you think it is?

04:42.930 --> 04:45.380
- Something they brought
back from the holy land.

04:46.900 --> 04:49.200
Something that don't
want anyone else to have.

04:50.140 --> 04:54.747
Some say it is a piece of Hell.

05:00.693 --> 05:01.536
- Thomas!

05:12.831 --> 05:13.664
Thomas!

05:19.713 --> 05:21.593
- Thomas, what happened?

05:23.090 --> 05:25.003
- Sit. Warm yourselves.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.490
- We don't have time to stop now, Thomas.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.280
We can rest when we reach our destination.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.720
- When will that be, I wonder?

05:34.720 --> 05:36.900
When there is no more food?

05:36.900 --> 05:39.630
When there is no strength to go further?

05:39.630 --> 05:41.113
- Thomas-
- Simon,

05:42.520 --> 05:44.380
by now they surely kept it all

05:46.190 --> 05:48.583
There is no returning from this place.

05:49.620 --> 05:52.390
Don't they at least
deserve to know why it is

05:52.390 --> 05:53.403
they die out here,

05:55.010 --> 05:58.563
so far from home, so forgotten?

05:59.730 --> 06:02.180
- We made our pledge to
our order and to our God.

06:03.670 --> 06:05.620
They have charged us with this mission.

06:06.760 --> 06:08.210
That is enough.

06:08.210 --> 06:09.593
- Even now, Simon,

06:10.800 --> 06:13.773
as you stand here a
thousand leagues from home,

06:15.720 --> 06:17.313
the order is dissolved.

06:19.080 --> 06:21.513
The grandmaster is executed.

06:22.990 --> 06:25.640
Your holy brothers are imprisoned.

06:25.640 --> 06:26.983
- How can you know this?

06:28.000 --> 06:30.303
- Don't they deserve to know the truth?

06:31.445 --> 06:33.820
- Master, what does he mean?

06:33.820 --> 06:35.920
- Don't you want to know what it is

06:35.920 --> 06:39.400
you take with you to your
graves at the end of the Earth?

06:39.400 --> 06:40.860
- I want to know.

06:40.860 --> 06:41.693
- Matthew.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.373
- Why don't you tell them.

06:45.260 --> 06:47.293
- Master, we deserve at least that.

06:48.259 --> 06:51.350
I have a wife and children
I'll never see again.

06:51.350 --> 06:54.357
- James, you will never
again see your sister Jumani.

06:58.806 --> 07:01.210
I can't.

07:01.210 --> 07:04.333
- You can't or you won't?

07:06.822 --> 07:07.655
- I can't.

07:14.010 --> 07:15.060
Because I don't know.

07:21.980 --> 07:23.223
I don't know what it is.

07:24.390 --> 07:27.420
My order was to take
the box as far as could,

07:27.420 --> 07:29.740
to the end of the world, to hide it,

07:29.740 --> 07:32.250
and to never, never open it.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.420
- You brought us all this
way to die for nothing?

07:35.420 --> 07:38.330
- Not for nothing, because God willed it.

07:38.330 --> 07:40.960
- Men willed it!
- Yours is not to question.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.093
- I want to know what's in that box.

07:44.062 --> 07:45.067
- Matthew, no.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.033
- Open that box!

07:51.330 --> 07:53.350
- I can't let you open it.

07:53.350 --> 07:55.400
- So help me, God, I'll
take the key off your corpse

07:55.400 --> 07:56.850
and open it myself.
- Matthew,

07:56.850 --> 07:59.110
you don't mean that.
- I do mean it!

07:59.110 --> 08:00.203
Open that box!

08:02.639 --> 08:04.780
- You're going to have
to kill me, Matthew.

08:11.439 --> 08:13.105
- No!

08:13.105 --> 08:13.938
No!

09:17.880 --> 09:19.513
- Don't be stupid, James.

09:21.308 --> 09:22.475
- All is lost.

09:56.003 --> 09:57.892
- What are you?

12:06.590 --> 12:07.593
My Lord!

12:09.980 --> 12:13.797
Tell me that our sacrifice
has not been in vain!

15:31.769 --> 15:33.102
- Good morning.

15:36.256 --> 15:37.089
Bad dream?

15:40.790 --> 15:42.690
I used to have bad dreams all the time

15:44.082 --> 15:44.932
when I was a kid.

15:46.460 --> 15:49.060
I'd wake up screaming and
run into my parent's room.

15:50.440 --> 15:52.220
They seemed so real.

15:52.220 --> 15:53.938
- Your parents or the dreams?

15:53.938 --> 15:56.163
- Hmm. Both.

16:00.507 --> 16:03.567
You know, I don't think I dream anymore.

16:05.371 --> 16:06.940
- Everybody dreams.

16:06.940 --> 16:09.633
- Not me, but I don't need to.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.274
I have you.

16:59.140 --> 17:00.345
- Hello?

17:01.930 --> 17:04.310
Why didn't you ever mention
your brother before?

17:04.310 --> 17:05.660
- You mean my half-brother.

17:06.740 --> 17:10.453
- Okay. Why did he ever mention
your half-brother before?

17:11.900 --> 17:14.320
- You never talk about your family.

17:14.320 --> 17:15.270
- That's different.

17:17.290 --> 17:20.210
- I haven't seen him in almost 20 years.

17:20.210 --> 17:21.710
Not since my father's funeral.

17:23.690 --> 17:24.720
Our father's funeral

17:26.120 --> 17:29.250
Actually, that was the
only time I ever saw him.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.990
- You mean your mother
didn't know your dad

17:30.990 --> 17:31.990
had a second family?

17:32.938 --> 17:36.250
- No. We met them at his funeral.

17:43.178 --> 17:48.178
by the ancient voice

19:23.830 --> 19:26.640
Did I mention that my
half-brother was crazy?

19:26.640 --> 19:28.780
- You said he was a psychiatrist.

19:28.780 --> 19:29.708
- He was.

20:27.197 --> 20:28.746
"Music to Kill Yourself By."

20:31.840 --> 20:32.884
- Oh, my God.

21:02.528 --> 21:05.028
- After careful consideration,

21:06.561 --> 21:09.204
I've come to the conclusion

21:09.204 --> 21:11.951
that I have gone insane.

21:11.951 --> 21:13.701
- It's the ultimate joke.
- Lewis?

21:16.530 --> 21:17.986
What are you watching?

21:17.986 --> 21:18.819
- Nothing.

21:42.011 --> 21:43.178
- It's locked.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.545
- I guess we'll just have to...

21:48.171 --> 21:49.616
Lewis!

21:49.616 --> 21:50.449
- What?

22:23.980 --> 22:25.017
- What does it say?

22:25.017 --> 22:29.833
- "Never under any circumstances
open this box ever!"

22:32.750 --> 22:33.923
Now we have to open it.

22:35.060 --> 22:37.017
Who could resist a set up like that?

22:38.360 --> 22:39.698
- Don't touch it.

22:39.698 --> 22:41.340
There could be something dangerous inside.

22:41.340 --> 22:43.233
- Like what, a bomb?

22:46.951 --> 22:48.201
- What's wrong?

22:49.590 --> 22:51.823
- Nothing. Just a shock.

22:54.330 --> 22:56.363
- I don't like it here. Let's go.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.990
- Okay. We'll leave the box till last.

23:00.990 --> 23:03.290
- It's not just the box.
It's the whole house.

23:05.390 --> 23:06.790
Can't you feel it?

23:06.790 --> 23:08.300
- Look, Eve,

23:08.300 --> 23:10.842
I don't wanna be here
any more than you do,

23:10.842 --> 23:13.292
but like it or not, this
house belongs to me now.

23:14.740 --> 23:18.607
I promise we'll leave as soon
as everything's taken care of.

23:18.607 --> 23:19.440
Okay?

23:26.010 --> 23:27.460
- Why do you think he did it?

23:28.443 --> 23:31.650
- Because he knew things
would never get any better.

23:31.650 --> 23:33.118
They could only get worse.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.383
That's my guess.

23:37.700 --> 23:39.261
- How sad.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.120
You spend all that time listening

23:42.120 --> 23:43.743
to other people's problems,

23:45.060 --> 23:47.856
but he had no one he could
tell his own problems to.

23:49.500 --> 23:50.333
- He called me.

23:52.598 --> 23:53.431
- When?

23:54.610 --> 23:55.960
- Three or four months ago.

23:57.940 --> 23:58.893
He left a message,

24:00.720 --> 24:02.103
but I didn't call him back.

24:04.050 --> 24:05.180
I blocked his number

24:08.920 --> 24:09.873
and now he's dead.

24:16.670 --> 24:21.207
- Lewis, you can't blame
yourself for what he did.

24:22.910 --> 24:23.910
It's not your fault.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.533
- What would I do without you?

24:41.481 --> 24:42.564
- Yeah, well,

24:45.928 --> 24:48.028
I can think of two things you wouldn't do.

24:58.730 --> 24:59.563
- I love you.

25:07.489 --> 25:08.489
- No, Lewis!

25:09.369 --> 25:10.202
There was someone in the room!

25:10.202 --> 25:11.375
There was someone else in the room!

25:11.375 --> 25:12.975
- No, there's not. It's shadows.

25:14.100 --> 25:14.933
Look.

25:17.530 --> 25:19.280
There's no one there.
- Lewis, please.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.840
I saw him.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.663
Please check the room. Please.

25:45.601 --> 25:47.900
You didn't check the closet.

25:47.900 --> 25:49.163
- Right. The closet.

25:55.852 --> 25:56.852
It's empty.

26:10.057 --> 26:13.535
Do you want me to check
the rest of the house?

26:14.961 --> 26:18.453
It's the ultimate joke.

26:19.910 --> 26:21.363
Psychiatrist losing his mind.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.110
- I've come to this conclusion because

26:25.110 --> 26:26.440
the other possibilities

26:28.297 --> 26:30.573
just don't make sense,

26:31.710 --> 26:34.020
but I have stumbled on the truth,

26:34.020 --> 26:36.707
that there really is a
conspiracy against humanity,

26:39.240 --> 26:40.273
torture us,

26:41.700 --> 26:44.120
plant ideas in our minds,

26:44.120 --> 26:45.590
steal our thoughts.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.300
They're corrupting me.

26:51.357 --> 26:53.060
Manipulating me.

26:53.060 --> 26:54.023
Mocking me.

26:54.930 --> 26:57.331
They want to lure all of us to our doom.

26:59.060 --> 27:01.483
But the simplest answer
is usually correct.

27:05.140 --> 27:06.450
I have lost my mind.

27:10.002 --> 27:12.500
No.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.483
The more I learned, the
more real it becomes.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.920
Once your eyes are open
to something like this,

27:19.920 --> 27:22.774
they can never be shut to it again.

27:25.960 --> 27:30.960
It is making manifest
of all that is hidden.

27:33.328 --> 27:35.535
Tonight I did something.

27:37.839 --> 27:39.672
Something unthinkable.

27:41.323 --> 27:43.760
I am so sorry, Catherine.

27:46.420 --> 27:48.467
I know what I have to do now.

28:08.324 --> 28:12.407
I want to apologize to
whoever gets this message.

28:14.857 --> 28:17.523
I want to apologize for
destroying your life.

28:49.120 --> 28:49.953
- Lewis?

28:57.060 --> 28:58.010
What are you doing?

28:59.770 --> 29:00.720
- I couldn't sleep.

29:03.210 --> 29:05.323
It's okay. I covered it up.

29:14.340 --> 29:16.163
These must be some of his patients.

29:19.880 --> 29:20.880
Let's have a listen.

29:24.450 --> 29:26.130
Michael Ballard.

29:26.130 --> 29:27.548
This was taped a year ago.

29:33.230 --> 29:35.150
- Not long ago, I was on the subway

29:36.470 --> 29:38.930
and I saw this woman watching me,

29:38.930 --> 29:40.630
like she knew what I was thinking.

29:41.640 --> 29:45.253
I looked away, but I saw her
reflection in the window.

29:46.394 --> 29:49.067
And it didn't look right.

29:49.067 --> 29:52.800
And that's when I realized that anyone

29:52.800 --> 29:55.693
might not really be what they seem to be.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.470
How would you know?

29:58.470 --> 30:02.590
- Well, I guess you wouldn't,
but with the evidence,

30:02.590 --> 30:05.464
wouldn't it be unreasonable to
think that's how things are?

30:05.464 --> 30:08.680
Someone is always watching us.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.253
There are cameras everywhere.

30:11.270 --> 30:13.430
- Well the cameras are
usually there for our safety

30:13.430 --> 30:15.990
not to spy on us.
- Safety?

30:15.990 --> 30:19.340
They use them to monitor our actions.

30:19.340 --> 30:20.780
- Why would they do that?

30:20.780 --> 30:22.203
- So they can fuck us up.

30:23.320 --> 30:26.610
A few weeks ago, someone
erased my computer,

30:26.610 --> 30:28.520
everything gone.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.850
And right after that, my keys go missing.

30:30.850 --> 30:32.826
I look everywhere for them.

30:32.826 --> 30:35.100
And then I find them locked in my car

30:35.100 --> 30:36.560
with the engine running.

30:36.560 --> 30:38.423
I had to break the window to get in.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.730
- Everybody makes mistakes
like that from time to time.

30:41.730 --> 30:43.490
It doesn't mean someone's out to get you.

30:43.490 --> 30:45.110
- As soon as I get the window fixed,

30:45.110 --> 30:47.263
my keys go missing again.

30:48.290 --> 30:51.310
I find them locked in
the car, engine running.

30:51.310 --> 30:52.513
- Let me ask you this.

30:53.670 --> 30:55.590
How do you think you'd react if a friend

30:55.590 --> 30:59.290
told you that someone was
secretly trying to ruin his life?

30:59.290 --> 31:00.533
- I'd say he was crazy.

31:02.290 --> 31:04.371
Is that what you're telling me, Doctor?

31:04.371 --> 31:05.740
Are you saying I'm crazy?

31:05.740 --> 31:10.740
- Of course not, but maybe
you're imagining things

31:11.120 --> 31:14.713
to explain what you don't want
to take responsibility for.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.370
What about the dreams?

31:17.370 --> 31:19.570
Do you think you might be
ready to talk about them?

31:19.570 --> 31:22.343
- I really don't remember them,

31:23.610 --> 31:24.923
but what I do remember,

31:28.820 --> 31:30.670
I can't say it out loud.

31:30.670 --> 31:32.170
- Why not?

31:32.170 --> 31:34.467
- I'm afraid that if I do

31:36.198 --> 31:37.356
it'll come true.

31:40.017 --> 31:41.730
- I want you to keep a
pen and paper by the bed

31:41.730 --> 31:44.580
so you can write your dreams
down as soon as you wake up.

31:46.330 --> 31:47.730
I'll see you next week then.

32:07.578 --> 32:08.900
You know, it was the
weirdest thing, Catherine.

32:08.900 --> 32:11.430
I had to go back inside
to get my spare keys.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.563
- The synchronicity.

32:13.690 --> 32:15.620
The most interesting
part of the phenomenon

32:15.620 --> 32:17.223
is that it's self-generating.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.570
The more you notice it,
the more it happens.

32:20.570 --> 32:22.906
If you think about it too
much, you see it everywhere.

32:25.360 --> 32:28.200
Has your patient opened
up about his dreams yet?

32:28.200 --> 32:29.173
- No, not yet.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.760
I can't help thinking
that's where the answer is.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.260
Somewhere in the dreams.

32:33.260 --> 32:34.850
The poor guy can barely get to sleep,

32:34.850 --> 32:36.700
and when he does, he's
tortured by nightmares

32:36.700 --> 32:38.500
that he can't remember.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.457
- Or doesn't want to remember.

32:40.457 --> 32:42.807
- Oh, you tell me, you're
the expert on dreams.

32:43.950 --> 32:46.325
- So is that why you
offered to buy me a drink?

32:46.325 --> 32:47.570
- Catherine, you know I wouldn't-

32:47.570 --> 32:49.840
- Robert, I'm only joking.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.610
You shouldn't take things so seriously.

32:52.610 --> 32:55.260
I'd be happy to help
you with your patient.

32:55.260 --> 32:57.540
In fact, there's a chapter in my book

32:57.540 --> 32:59.650
that might be useful to you.

32:59.650 --> 33:01.130
It's not exactly finished yet,

33:01.130 --> 33:05.614
but I could let you read the latest draft.

33:05.614 --> 33:07.300
- Well that might spoil the ending.

33:07.300 --> 33:09.253
- A bad ending is a good beginning.

33:17.660 --> 33:20.700
- Hi, can I help you?

33:20.700 --> 33:22.930
- I'm Catherine Darrow.

33:22.930 --> 33:25.223
I was an associate of Dr. Shavers.

33:27.720 --> 33:29.520
You're Robert's brother, aren't you?

33:30.430 --> 33:31.263
- Half-brother.

33:32.800 --> 33:35.210
- He was a fine doctor and a good man.

33:35.210 --> 33:36.043
He'll be missed.

33:38.420 --> 33:40.550
I'm sorry, I'm not intruding, am I?

33:41.400 --> 33:43.100
- No, not at all.

33:43.100 --> 33:45.730
We just weren't expecting any visitors.

33:45.730 --> 33:46.640
Come in.

33:46.640 --> 33:47.473
- Thank you.

33:55.710 --> 33:57.480
You'll have to forgive
my manners, Miss Darrow.

33:57.480 --> 33:58.453
- Dr. Darrow.

33:59.610 --> 34:00.760
You wrote that book, didn't you?

34:00.760 --> 34:03.410
- Oh, my. You haven't read it, have you?

34:03.410 --> 34:05.840
- No, but I just saw in Robert's office.

34:05.840 --> 34:06.973
- This is Eve.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.600
My name's Lewis, by the way.

34:10.600 --> 34:11.683
- Yes, I know.

34:12.630 --> 34:14.630
They told me that you would be here

34:14.630 --> 34:18.902
and I've been waiting quite
anxiously for you to arrive.

34:18.902 --> 34:20.840
- I'm afraid I don't understand.

34:20.840 --> 34:23.840
- Robert and I have been
collaborating on some research

34:24.780 --> 34:29.090
and I was hoping to come here
and salvage some of his files.

34:29.090 --> 34:32.190
It would be a shame to see
his hard work go to waste.

34:32.190 --> 34:33.650
- Actually, it would be kind of helpful

34:33.650 --> 34:35.300
to have a pair of professional eyes

34:35.300 --> 34:37.070
going over all that stuff.

34:37.070 --> 34:38.690
I don't know what's
important and what's not.

34:38.690 --> 34:41.370
- Well, maybe we can
help each other out then.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.709
How does that sound?

34:48.528 --> 34:51.120
Is this where he...

34:51.120 --> 34:51.953
- Yeah.

34:53.867 --> 34:55.767
- Well, I guess we should get started.

35:09.930 --> 35:11.580
So I understand you're a teacher.

35:12.530 --> 35:14.973
- Actually, I'm a substitute teacher now.

35:16.040 --> 35:17.230
How'd you know that?

35:17.230 --> 35:18.183
- Robert told me.

35:22.450 --> 35:24.073
He talked about you quite often.

35:25.030 --> 35:25.863
- He did?

35:27.100 --> 35:28.800
- You were the only family he had.

35:33.562 --> 35:35.230
What does Eve do?

35:35.230 --> 35:36.350
- She's a model.

35:36.350 --> 35:37.483
- I'm not surprised.

35:41.730 --> 35:43.313
- Sorry. I'm late.

35:57.951 --> 35:59.370
- What's all that?

35:59.370 --> 36:02.130
- You told me to write down my dreams.

36:02.130 --> 36:02.963
So I did.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.740
I remember now.

37:51.685 --> 37:54.753
So, what do you think?

37:56.260 --> 38:01.260
- I think this is what we
usually call a breakthrough.

38:02.470 --> 38:04.160
- But what does it mean?

38:04.160 --> 38:07.610
- Well, there's a lot of dream imagery

38:07.610 --> 38:11.010
that many believe to be universal.

38:11.010 --> 38:13.100
I think it's a little
different for each of us

38:13.100 --> 38:17.920
and we just need to figure
out what it means for you.

38:17.920 --> 38:20.810
Unfortunately, that's all
the time we have right now.

38:20.810 --> 38:23.853
I think you've made
remarkable progress today.

38:25.120 --> 38:26.780
- I don't feel any better.

38:26.780 --> 38:29.820
- Oh, not yet maybe, but I'm sure you will

38:29.820 --> 38:31.400
over the sessions that follow.

38:31.400 --> 38:34.680
In the meantime, you'll keep
writing down the dreams?

38:34.680 --> 38:35.513
- Yes.

38:37.020 --> 38:38.609
- I'll see you next week then.

38:53.280 --> 38:55.970
Soon will be made manifest

38:57.138 --> 38:59.526
all that is hidden.

39:25.294 --> 39:26.417
- All right.

39:26.417 --> 39:29.369
All right, I'll see you then. Bye.

39:29.369 --> 39:30.400
Can I help you?

39:30.400 --> 39:32.190
- Well, actually I was
just wondering about

39:32.190 --> 39:33.386
the painting in the window.

39:34.830 --> 39:36.400
- That's not for sale.

39:36.400 --> 39:38.320
- I just wanna know where you got the idea

39:38.320 --> 39:39.860
for that painting.

39:39.860 --> 39:43.469
- Well, most of my paintings

39:43.469 --> 39:45.639
are studies of found objects.

39:45.639 --> 39:47.739
- Oh so you painted it from a real object.

39:49.770 --> 39:54.160
- The box is from a dream I had.

39:54.160 --> 39:54.993
- Really?

39:58.430 --> 40:02.280
Someone I know recently
drew a sketch of a box

40:02.280 --> 40:04.260
from a dream that he had

40:04.260 --> 40:07.033
- A box is hardly an unusual image.

40:08.730 --> 40:10.900
In fact, it's kind of an archetype.

40:10.900 --> 40:12.580
- No, you don't understand.

40:12.580 --> 40:15.928
He didn't draw a box, um...

40:21.250 --> 40:22.363
He drew that box.

40:26.660 --> 40:28.383
- Well he must have copied my painting.

40:31.420 --> 40:33.130
- How long has you're
painting been on display?

40:33.130 --> 40:34.287
- Since yesterday.

40:36.530 --> 40:38.230
- I've had this sketch for a week.

40:39.620 --> 40:41.640
- How is that possible?

40:41.640 --> 40:42.962
- I don't know.

40:45.610 --> 40:50.610
I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

41:42.952 --> 41:43.785
Hello?

41:48.967 --> 41:49.800
Steve?

42:30.053 --> 42:31.677
Yes?

42:31.677 --> 42:33.077
- You need to sign for this.

42:45.250 --> 42:46.083
Be careful.

42:47.090 --> 42:47.923
It's heavy.

44:18.329 --> 44:19.162
No!

45:19.620 --> 45:21.260
- Fuck you.

45:46.903 --> 45:47.736
Eve?

45:50.021 --> 45:52.688
How long has this been going on?

45:55.490 --> 45:56.393
- Two months.

45:59.190 --> 46:01.183
Do you think there's
something wrong with me?

46:03.200 --> 46:04.033
- No.

46:05.560 --> 46:06.860
- Can I tell you anything?

46:08.228 --> 46:09.370
- Of course you can.

46:12.050 --> 46:13.300
- Promise not to hate me?

46:14.253 --> 46:15.463
- How could I hate you?

46:17.508 --> 46:19.008
- The first time we made love,

46:20.740 --> 46:21.593
do you remember?

46:22.499 --> 46:23.582
- I remember.

46:26.150 --> 46:29.530
- The first few times, not every time...

46:32.410 --> 46:34.270
You don't wanna hear this.

46:34.270 --> 46:36.505
- No, I need to hear this.

46:39.530 --> 46:40.823
- You'd be inside of me,

46:44.020 --> 46:45.320
and I'd be looking at you,

46:49.270 --> 46:51.763
there'd be something wrong with your face,

46:53.850 --> 46:54.703
with your eyes.

46:59.849 --> 47:02.750
And I'd have to try so
hard to hide from you

47:02.750 --> 47:03.873
that I was scared.

47:08.002 --> 47:09.752
I could see you in a different way.

47:23.070 --> 47:25.320
And then you'd smile at me.

47:26.721 --> 47:28.321
And I wouldn't wanna look at you

47:29.690 --> 47:33.163
but I'd have to because
you were on top of me.

47:36.735 --> 47:37.843
And you'd just smile.

47:45.452 --> 47:46.702
But your eyes.

47:49.140 --> 47:50.363
Your eyes were wrong.

47:55.530 --> 47:58.540
You do think there's something
wrong with me, don't you?

47:58.540 --> 48:01.213
- No, no, of course not.

48:02.770 --> 48:04.363
It was a new relationship then.

48:06.230 --> 48:08.080
We didn't really know each other yet.

48:09.240 --> 48:12.673
You were scared for lots of things.

48:13.930 --> 48:15.033
It makes sense.

48:19.970 --> 48:21.703
There's nothing wrong with you.

48:26.700 --> 48:29.623
Dr. Darrow is a specialist
in sleep disorders, Eve.

48:30.920 --> 48:31.904
- I don't feel right.

48:31.904 --> 48:33.330
- No, please.

48:33.330 --> 48:35.250
Eve, I'd be happy to help.

48:35.250 --> 48:37.830
You both have been so helpful to me.

48:37.830 --> 48:39.483
It's the least I could do.

48:41.040 --> 48:43.420
Why don't we just talk for a bit,

48:43.420 --> 48:45.793
nothing formal, just a chat.

48:46.690 --> 48:49.823
and if you don't feel
comfortable, we can stop.

48:51.590 --> 48:52.423
All right?

48:55.620 --> 48:56.453
- All right.

49:00.140 --> 49:02.023
- I'll be in the office.

49:07.920 --> 49:10.278
- So tell me about the first time

49:10.278 --> 49:11.907
you had one of these dreams.

49:59.747 --> 50:02.633
- I'm so sorry. I didn't
realize you couldn't hear me.

50:03.597 --> 50:04.430
- That's okay.

50:07.170 --> 50:08.320
- Roger Keith.

50:08.320 --> 50:10.600
- Yeah. It's a pretty strange stuff.

50:10.600 --> 50:12.570
It doesn't seem like
Robert's kind of music.

50:12.570 --> 50:15.700
- No, it had something to do
with his patient's dreams.

50:15.700 --> 50:17.933
Not sure what the connection was.

50:19.727 --> 50:21.650
- So how's it going with Eve?

50:21.650 --> 50:26.650
- It's good, but we've
just scratched the surface.

50:26.740 --> 50:28.430
We're taking a break.

50:28.430 --> 50:30.303
She's been under a lot of stress.

50:31.350 --> 50:32.300
- Really?

50:32.300 --> 50:34.912
- Do you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

50:34.912 --> 50:36.923
- All right, go ahead.

50:36.923 --> 50:39.350
- Personal questions.

50:39.350 --> 50:40.465
- Anything to help Eve.

50:42.340 --> 50:43.930
- Would you think it fair to say

50:43.930 --> 50:46.053
that you've put Eve on a pedestal?

50:46.930 --> 50:51.930
- Well, maybe a bit, but she's perfect.

50:52.440 --> 50:54.333
- Nobody's perfect, Lewis.

50:55.315 --> 50:58.880
- I know that, but she's
as close as they come.

50:58.880 --> 51:01.720
She's everything I've
ever wanted in a woman.

51:01.720 --> 51:05.610
After they made her, they broke the mold.

51:05.610 --> 51:07.653
- Then you're lucky to have found her.

51:08.630 --> 51:10.893
- She came along at just
the right time in my life.

52:05.150 --> 52:05.983
Hello?

52:06.870 --> 52:07.870
You're late.

52:09.080 --> 52:10.670
Not quite.

52:10.670 --> 52:12.433
I've been waiting half an hour.

52:13.470 --> 52:14.580
Who am I talking to?

52:14.580 --> 52:16.770
- It's Eve. Who did you think it was?

52:16.770 --> 52:20.430
I, oh, I must have the wrong number.

52:20.430 --> 52:22.304
I'm sorry.
- Don't hang up.

52:23.490 --> 52:25.050
- Why shouldn't I?

52:25.050 --> 52:26.980
- Because I'll kill myself you do.

52:26.980 --> 52:29.450
- Well, we can't have that now, can we?

52:30.987 --> 52:35.473
- It was just a wrong
number, total coincidence.

52:36.310 --> 52:39.063
But it changed my life.

52:45.290 --> 52:47.640
- You and Robert were a lot alike.

52:47.640 --> 52:49.390
- What do you mean?

52:49.390 --> 52:53.363
- Well, for one thing, he was
fascinated by coincidences.

52:54.730 --> 52:56.570
I guess certain things
just run in the family.

52:56.570 --> 52:57.403
Don't they?

52:58.360 --> 53:00.031
- We had nothing in common.

53:01.904 --> 53:06.904
what's underneath the tree

53:16.866 --> 53:19.033
- Robert, Merry Christmas.

53:21.718 --> 53:23.499
- Merry Christmas.

53:25.227 --> 53:26.060
- Oh.

53:27.721 --> 53:29.721
Do you want to sit down?

53:35.940 --> 53:36.800
- I'm sorry, Catherine.

53:36.800 --> 53:39.323
I know I've been a bit preoccupied lately.

53:41.493 --> 53:42.530
- It's okay.

53:42.530 --> 53:45.610
I know you can really throw
yourself into your work.

53:45.610 --> 53:47.100
It's just I usually hear from you

53:47.100 --> 53:48.700
if you aren't gonna make it out.

53:50.900 --> 53:53.493
Um, I got you something.

53:56.827 --> 53:57.660
Here.

54:00.518 --> 54:03.185
- It's your book. It's terrific.

54:04.450 --> 54:06.180
- I know it's not a proper present,

54:06.180 --> 54:09.733
but I wanted you to be the
first person to get a copy.

54:11.070 --> 54:12.040
I hope it helps

54:15.750 --> 54:16.833
with your patient.

54:18.100 --> 54:19.403
- Oh, that's great.

54:20.837 --> 54:23.487
The trouble is I can't get ahold of him,

54:23.487 --> 54:26.210
and it's been almost three months

54:26.210 --> 54:28.323
and I just can't track him down.

54:29.290 --> 54:30.573
- I hope he's all right.

54:33.120 --> 54:35.030
I hope you're all right.

54:36.166 --> 54:37.293
- Oh, I'm fine.

54:38.440 --> 54:39.273
Really.

54:40.410 --> 54:42.088
Just a lot to think about.

54:42.088 --> 54:46.459
tree stays under the tree

54:47.677 --> 54:48.927
- Well open it.

55:22.848 --> 55:25.537
- Good night, Catherine.

55:25.537 --> 55:27.287
- Good night, Robert.

55:29.448 --> 55:30.365
Good night.

55:59.749 --> 56:02.420
We know that you know.

56:04.710 --> 56:05.660
- What did you say?

56:07.923 --> 56:10.891
Has he opened it yet?

56:10.891 --> 56:12.058
- Opened what?

56:17.995 --> 56:22.995
- Eve, have you ever
considered the possibility

56:23.560 --> 56:27.820
that Lewis might just
be a different person

56:27.820 --> 56:29.150
than you think he is?

56:29.150 --> 56:31.233
- No. No, he's not.

56:32.230 --> 56:34.490
- We're all more than one person, really.

56:34.490 --> 56:39.490
Like we have two hands
and sometimes we use one

56:39.490 --> 56:42.842
and sometimes the other,
but they're both our hands.

56:45.239 --> 56:47.411
Do you see what I'm saying?

57:24.480 --> 57:28.070
- "Several years ago, I
began to treat a patient

57:28.070 --> 57:29.973
who for obvious reasons,

57:31.030 --> 57:32.870
cannot be identified.

57:32.870 --> 57:35.000
She had been involved in a criminal trial

57:36.070 --> 57:37.250
but was acquitted on the grounds

57:37.250 --> 57:40.078
that there was insufficient
evidence to convict her.

57:41.450 --> 57:42.890
She always maintained her innocence

57:42.890 --> 57:45.620
but so profound was her guilt complex

57:46.660 --> 57:49.610
that she withdrew almost
entirely from society."

57:49.610 --> 57:51.193
- Three things.

57:52.200 --> 57:55.703
First of all, what I have
to tell you, is true.

57:57.680 --> 58:01.253
Secondly, I am not insane,

58:03.090 --> 58:04.690
but it would be better if I was.

58:06.630 --> 58:11.630
And third, you must not repeat
a word of this to anyone,

58:14.780 --> 58:16.433
we're as good as dead if you do.

58:17.820 --> 58:20.462
If you don't wanna know
the truth, then look away.

58:22.930 --> 58:25.806
A hidden history is about to be unveiled.

58:28.960 --> 58:31.147
Do you know the word "sword principle?"

58:32.371 --> 58:34.560
That words written down or said aloud

58:34.560 --> 58:36.963
can cause certain
outcomes or consequences.

58:37.870 --> 58:40.737
Even if they were meant to
prevent those consequences.

58:43.760 --> 58:48.030
You see, just by warning you,

58:48.030 --> 58:50.593
I'm helping them achieve their goals.

58:53.610 --> 58:54.970
Who's there?

58:54.970 --> 58:55.803
Who are they?

58:57.200 --> 59:02.200
They're us, but they're not us.

59:03.750 --> 59:05.720
We're becoming them.

59:05.720 --> 59:08.550
And they want us to follow
them like sadistic idiots,

59:08.550 --> 59:11.623
down the dark path, straight
to a hell of our own making.

59:21.450 --> 59:25.070
There are three things that
must occur for this to happen.

59:25.070 --> 59:29.163
One, the creation and
destruction of primordial matter.

59:30.210 --> 59:33.363
Two, the killing of the king.

59:34.540 --> 59:35.373
And three,

59:38.280 --> 59:41.907
the making manifest of all that is hidden.

59:44.240 --> 59:45.833
This is their ultimate goal.

59:47.110 --> 59:48.823
The revelation of the method.

59:50.220 --> 59:52.323
And it is happening right now.

59:54.280 --> 59:55.763
Even as you read my words.

59:56.980 --> 59:59.255
Even if you believe them just a little.

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:08.833
Jane?

1:00:10.810 --> 1:00:13.530
Jane, why did you do it?

1:00:13.530 --> 1:00:16.229
Why did you let us die there alone?

1:00:30.382 --> 1:00:31.215
Jane?

1:00:32.520 --> 1:00:33.710
Jane?

1:00:33.710 --> 1:00:34.823
- Leave me alone.

1:00:36.280 --> 1:00:37.940
I did everything I could.

1:00:37.940 --> 1:00:40.650
That's what you told everyone.

1:00:40.650 --> 1:00:42.720
You were the reason we never
got out of those woods.

1:00:42.720 --> 1:00:45.280
Aren't you, Jane?
- No.

1:00:45.280 --> 1:00:46.321
No!

1:00:46.321 --> 1:00:48.460
You were the real reason.

1:00:48.460 --> 1:00:49.676
- No!

1:01:19.303 --> 1:01:23.250
- You're the reason we
died, aren't you, big sis?

1:01:28.053 --> 1:01:30.140
You should have died that day.

1:01:30.140 --> 1:01:32.040
You should have died, not us.

1:01:32.040 --> 1:01:32.923
- I tried.

1:01:35.700 --> 1:01:37.720
I did everything I could.

1:01:37.720 --> 1:01:38.653
- You killed us.

1:01:39.625 --> 1:01:41.875
You did with it with that.

1:01:46.890 --> 1:01:49.090
- There was nothing
else I could do for you.

1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:52.300
There was nothing else I could do!

1:01:52.300 --> 1:01:53.860
The daily horror show,

1:01:53.860 --> 1:01:55.940
once seen only in secret,

1:01:55.940 --> 1:01:59.890
but now slowly revealed while we watch

1:01:59.890 --> 1:02:03.020
in deep, frozen apathy
as the hidden history

1:02:03.020 --> 1:02:06.477
our real history is put on display.

1:02:07.610 --> 1:02:08.560
When this happens,

1:02:09.830 --> 1:02:11.846
when all that was hidden

1:02:13.720 --> 1:02:15.163
is hidden no longer.

1:02:16.050 --> 1:02:19.040
And you can watch with disinterest

1:02:20.220 --> 1:02:23.650
as wars, genocides, mind controls,

1:02:23.650 --> 1:02:25.390
decapitations, chemical spills,

1:02:25.390 --> 1:02:28.810
and sexual atrocities occur
right in front of you.

1:02:28.810 --> 1:02:31.363
When you can just sit there and watch,

1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:36.105
then all is lost.

1:02:37.090 --> 1:02:38.820
- Easy, easy.

1:02:38.820 --> 1:02:40.422
I'm not gonna hurt ya.

1:03:58.810 --> 1:04:00.690
I've ruined everything.

1:04:00.690 --> 1:04:03.693
- Jane Palmer, Downsview, Canada.

1:04:36.360 --> 1:04:37.243
- Jane Palmer.

1:04:42.193 --> 1:04:43.423
It's the same person.

1:04:45.180 --> 1:04:46.320
Catherine's patient and the woman

1:04:46.320 --> 1:04:48.610
who wrote this letter, Jane Palmer.

1:04:48.610 --> 1:04:49.750
- Hello?

1:04:49.750 --> 1:04:51.420
- Catherine, we have to talk.

1:04:51.420 --> 1:04:53.943
- Robert? What time is it?

1:04:53.943 --> 1:04:55.663
- It doesn't matter, listen,

1:04:56.600 --> 1:05:00.200
that patient in your book,
her name was Jade Palmer.

1:05:00.200 --> 1:05:02.112
She told you about something.

1:05:02.112 --> 1:05:04.070
- What are you talking about?

1:05:04.070 --> 1:05:06.870
- She told you about a box.

1:05:06.870 --> 1:05:08.533
Did you see it yourself?

1:05:10.040 --> 1:05:11.719
Did you touch it?

1:05:11.719 --> 1:05:15.063
- Robert, the box wasn't real.

1:05:16.060 --> 1:05:18.570
It was a metaphor she
used to contain her guilt.

1:05:18.570 --> 1:05:21.600
She, how do you know her name?

1:05:21.600 --> 1:05:23.730
I don't think we should
be talking about this.

1:05:23.730 --> 1:05:24.954
- Is it him?
- Shh.

1:05:24.954 --> 1:05:26.371
He doesn't know.

1:05:28.130 --> 1:05:30.783
Robert? Are you there?

1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:34.140
- I shouldn't have called.

1:05:40.940 --> 1:05:41.850
Hi, it's Lewis.

1:05:41.850 --> 1:05:44.020
Leave a message.

1:05:44.020 --> 1:05:45.073
- Lewis, it's Robert.

1:05:47.100 --> 1:05:48.070
Your brother.

1:05:51.543 --> 1:05:54.080
I know we haven't spoken in a long time

1:05:54.080 --> 1:05:55.923
but I need to talk to someone and I,

1:05:57.597 --> 1:05:59.430
I don't know who else I can turn to.

1:05:59.430 --> 1:06:00.263
- It's funny.

1:06:02.293 --> 1:06:04.923
I wouldn't dream of saying
these things to Lewis.

1:06:06.210 --> 1:06:09.093
- Don't you think that's
precisely what you dream about.

1:06:10.060 --> 1:06:10.893
- Excuse me.

1:06:11.790 --> 1:06:12.703
- Think about it.

1:06:13.720 --> 1:06:16.540
You dream about a threatening man,

1:06:16.540 --> 1:06:21.230
a stranger who enters your
bedroom as if he owns the place

1:06:21.230 --> 1:06:26.230
and molests you and you don't
resist or even speak out.

1:06:27.320 --> 1:06:28.153
- I can't.

1:06:30.430 --> 1:06:32.320
I want to, but I can't.

1:06:32.320 --> 1:06:36.850
- Exactly, just like you
want to talk to Lewis,

1:06:36.850 --> 1:06:41.443
but you can't, you're
too intimidated by him.

1:06:43.680 --> 1:06:45.853
You're terrified of disappointing him.

1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:52.200
So you remain silent and go
along with whatever Lewis wants.

1:06:53.360 --> 1:06:54.313
- Not always.

1:06:57.605 --> 1:07:00.070
Are you saying that this
stranger I dream about

1:07:00.070 --> 1:07:03.270
is really just Lewis?

1:07:03.270 --> 1:07:06.090
- You don't feel you really know Lewis

1:07:06.090 --> 1:07:07.803
or that he really knows you.

1:07:08.750 --> 1:07:11.250
On the surface, you have
a great relationship

1:07:11.250 --> 1:07:13.630
but clearly there are problems,

1:07:13.630 --> 1:07:15.223
problems you can't talk about.

1:07:17.570 --> 1:07:19.470
- Sometimes I don't think he treats me

1:07:19.470 --> 1:07:20.803
like I'm a real person.

1:07:22.670 --> 1:07:25.800
I mean, I know he loves me,

1:07:25.800 --> 1:07:29.870
but sometimes I'm afraid

1:07:29.870 --> 1:07:31.763
it isn't really me he loves,

1:07:33.310 --> 1:07:35.263
but this other person he thinks I am.

1:07:39.260 --> 1:07:40.910
And I'm afraid she doesn't exist.

1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:50.440
Does that make sense to you?

1:07:50.440 --> 1:07:54.223
- Eve, you've made
tremendous progress already.

1:07:55.210 --> 1:07:58.170
I really feel some walls coming down,

1:07:58.170 --> 1:08:00.450
but before you can even think about

1:08:00.450 --> 1:08:03.270
sorting out your relationship with Lewis,

1:08:03.270 --> 1:08:06.360
Lewis has to come to
terms with his own past,

1:08:06.360 --> 1:08:08.400
no matter how painful that may be.

1:08:08.400 --> 1:08:10.250
- You mean dealing with
the fact that his father

1:08:10.250 --> 1:08:11.800
led a double life?

1:08:11.800 --> 1:08:14.893
- Yes. Well that, but also
the incident at the school.

1:08:15.900 --> 1:08:19.540
He still won't accept any
responsibility for what happened.

1:08:19.540 --> 1:08:20.990
- What are you talking about?

1:08:21.870 --> 1:08:25.093
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:08:26.310 --> 1:08:28.860
Lewis told me you knew all about it.

1:08:28.860 --> 1:08:29.994
- About what?

1:09:20.968 --> 1:09:22.370
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry

1:09:22.370 --> 1:09:23.870
to disturb you, ma'am.

1:09:23.870 --> 1:09:26.060
I'm trying to locate someone,

1:09:26.060 --> 1:09:28.050
a woman named Jane Palmer.

1:09:28.050 --> 1:09:29.690
- I don't have it.

1:09:29.690 --> 1:09:30.650
- Have what?

1:09:30.650 --> 1:09:32.580
- You know what I'm talking about.

1:09:32.580 --> 1:09:33.820
I know you know.

1:09:33.820 --> 1:09:35.590
- I just wanna talk to Jane.

1:09:35.590 --> 1:09:36.423
- She's dead.

1:09:38.610 --> 1:09:39.443
- I'm sorry.

1:09:40.377 --> 1:09:42.053
- And she killed her own sister.

1:09:43.700 --> 1:09:44.763
She killed Sharon.

1:09:45.980 --> 1:09:48.430
And she made up all those
crazy stories about it.

1:09:50.330 --> 1:09:54.088
Now go away and please don't come back.

1:10:08.680 --> 1:10:09.513
Take it.

1:10:09.513 --> 1:10:10.413
- I-
- Take it.

1:10:12.600 --> 1:10:14.000
It's all that's left of her.

1:10:30.702 --> 1:10:31.623
- Eve?

1:10:36.310 --> 1:10:38.383
Eve? Are you awake?

1:10:49.126 --> 1:10:50.268
"The
story you are about

1:10:50.268 --> 1:10:51.800
to be told is true.

1:10:51.800 --> 1:10:54.180
It is the account of a tragedy

1:10:54.180 --> 1:10:57.223
that befell four young
women in the autumn of 1987.

1:10:58.410 --> 1:11:00.730
I
was one of those women.

1:11:00.730 --> 1:11:03.530
This is my story and it's the
only account of that tragedy

1:11:03.530 --> 1:11:04.603
you will ever hear.

1:11:05.780 --> 1:11:10.021
The other three girls
are all dead or worse.

1:11:12.320 --> 1:11:15.760
It's especially tragic
because we were all so young

1:11:15.760 --> 1:11:16.760
and so full of hope.

1:11:18.800 --> 1:11:20.763
And now all I have left is a nightmare.

1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:24.490
A nightmare I can never wake up from.

1:11:25.705 --> 1:11:27.250
- That's what happens when two sisters

1:11:27.250 --> 1:11:29.760
are hot for the same guy.
- As if!

1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:31.920
- Come on you two.

1:11:31.920 --> 1:11:34.940
If this place is so great, how
come nobody ever comes here?

1:11:34.940 --> 1:11:37.430
- Oh, there used to be
a mine or something.

1:11:37.430 --> 1:11:40.090
But after it got shut down, the town died

1:11:40.090 --> 1:11:41.930
and people stopped coming.

1:11:41.930 --> 1:11:42.960
Oh, turn here.

1:11:46.316 --> 1:11:48.070
- Is that even a road?

1:11:48.070 --> 1:11:49.610
- Come on, Gail.

1:11:49.610 --> 1:11:51.460
We'll take the road less traveled by.

1:11:53.750 --> 1:11:54.923
- Are you stoned?

1:11:55.928 --> 1:11:57.378
- I mean, just a little.

1:12:16.980 --> 1:12:18.430
- I thought you knew the way?

1:12:19.553 --> 1:12:20.953
I think we should turn back.

1:12:28.675 --> 1:12:29.508
Oh.

1:12:34.121 --> 1:12:35.748
I don't believe it.

1:12:35.748 --> 1:12:37.390
You must've missed a turn.

1:12:37.390 --> 1:12:38.623
- I didn't miss a turn.

1:13:06.177 --> 1:13:08.368
- Did you see that?
- What?

1:13:08.368 --> 1:13:10.441
Look out!

1:13:33.913 --> 1:13:36.536
- We have to go see if he's okay.

1:13:56.530 --> 1:13:57.563
Oh my God.

1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:03.530
Look what we did to his face.

1:14:10.960 --> 1:14:14.720
- I saw his face before he-

1:14:14.720 --> 1:14:15.830
- Is he dead?

1:14:15.830 --> 1:14:17.840
- No, but he's hurt pretty bad.

1:14:17.840 --> 1:14:19.530
- No shit.

1:14:19.530 --> 1:14:20.630
- We need to go for help.

1:14:20.630 --> 1:14:21.463
- We can't just leave him here.

1:14:21.463 --> 1:14:23.160
- Then you stay with him.

1:14:23.160 --> 1:14:24.960
- Why me?
- It's okay, Jane.

1:14:24.960 --> 1:14:25.910
I'll stay with you.

1:14:27.760 --> 1:14:30.360
- I'll find the nearest phone
and then I'll come right back.

1:14:30.360 --> 1:14:31.193
- Just hurry.

1:14:35.023 --> 1:14:36.930
- Gail,

1:14:36.930 --> 1:14:38.522
we're going for help, and I'm driving.

1:14:38.522 --> 1:14:40.450
Is he dead?

1:14:40.450 --> 1:14:42.733
- No, but we have to go right away.

1:14:48.700 --> 1:14:50.343
Come on, Gail. Get in the car.

1:14:51.468 --> 1:14:52.568
Gail!

1:14:54.050 --> 1:14:55.048
I'm going.

1:14:56.594 --> 1:14:58.353
Oh, I gotta go.

1:15:08.020 --> 1:15:09.393
- Poor Gail.

1:15:12.180 --> 1:15:17.030
- I saw his face before he hit the glass.

1:15:17.030 --> 1:15:17.863
- Yeah.

1:15:19.670 --> 1:15:20.961
- It was...

1:15:26.080 --> 1:15:28.423
- Oh my God! Did we do that?

1:15:29.260 --> 1:15:30.450
- We have to find it.

1:15:30.450 --> 1:15:31.490
- Why?

1:15:31.490 --> 1:15:34.640
- Because they can reattach
it if we find it in time.

1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:37.310
- So we have to look for this guy's arm?

1:15:37.310 --> 1:15:38.813
- If it was lying here,
wouldn't you want someone-

1:15:38.813 --> 1:15:40.173
- Yes, okay, fine.

1:15:45.130 --> 1:15:46.730
- We'll have to check the woods.

1:15:50.820 --> 1:15:52.030
- Where are you going?

1:15:52.030 --> 1:15:54.050
- We're just looking for something.

1:15:54.050 --> 1:15:55.310
- Looking for what?

1:15:55.310 --> 1:15:56.460
- Don't worry about it.

1:15:57.910 --> 1:15:59.983
- This is not happening to me.

1:16:00.820 --> 1:16:02.580
- It could be anywhere.

1:16:02.580 --> 1:16:04.350
Let's try the other side of the road.

1:16:04.350 --> 1:16:05.700
- It's gonna get dark soon.

1:16:05.700 --> 1:16:07.250
- That's why we have to find it now.

1:16:07.250 --> 1:16:09.160
- And we don't even have
a flashlight, do we?

1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:10.093
- Yes, we do.

1:16:11.817 --> 1:16:12.843
It's in the car.

1:16:23.270 --> 1:16:25.520
- His arm is missing.

1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:27.120
- That's what we're looking for.

1:16:30.940 --> 1:16:32.360
Gail, we know you're upset

1:16:32.360 --> 1:16:33.880
but this isn't helping.

1:16:33.880 --> 1:16:35.909
Just help us find the arm.

1:16:35.909 --> 1:16:37.409
- I can't do that.

1:17:15.809 --> 1:17:16.726
I found it.

1:17:38.525 --> 1:17:39.492
What's wrong?

1:17:47.050 --> 1:17:48.281
- Sharon!

1:17:48.281 --> 1:17:49.114
- Jane!

1:17:51.456 --> 1:17:52.289
- Sharon?

1:17:53.773 --> 1:17:56.430
Sharon!
- Don't leave me alone!

1:17:57.920 --> 1:17:58.753
- Sharon!

1:18:10.060 --> 1:18:12.228
Gail, come on. Hurry up.

1:18:12.228 --> 1:18:13.811
- I can't. I can't.

1:18:22.926 --> 1:18:23.759
- Gail.

1:18:27.734 --> 1:18:28.567
Gail?

1:18:35.995 --> 1:18:37.030
What?

1:19:19.570 --> 1:19:20.603
- We must hurry!

1:19:57.802 --> 1:20:00.578
I did not expect so many
of them to be about.

1:20:00.578 --> 1:20:02.078
At first light, we must leave.

1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:07.973
- What about my sister?

1:20:15.317 --> 1:20:16.517
Must sleep while we can.

1:20:42.943 --> 1:20:44.193
Jane!

1:20:45.225 --> 1:20:46.058
Jane!

1:20:49.432 --> 1:20:50.648
Jane!

1:20:53.163 --> 1:20:54.300
Jane!

1:20:54.300 --> 1:20:56.100
- It's my sister!

1:20:56.100 --> 1:20:56.933
- Be silent.

1:20:58.450 --> 1:20:59.493
Be still.

1:21:00.496 --> 1:21:01.746
Jane!

1:21:05.137 --> 1:21:05.970
Jane!

1:21:17.219 --> 1:21:20.953
- Believe me, that wasn't your sister.

1:21:29.590 --> 1:21:30.990
They're making sport of you.

1:21:32.410 --> 1:21:33.243
It's their way.

1:21:33.243 --> 1:21:34.763
I've seen it many times.

1:21:36.240 --> 1:21:37.900
Their greatest delight is
drawing people like you

1:21:37.900 --> 1:21:41.623
into that clutches so they can debase you,

1:21:42.830 --> 1:21:43.763
straw you.

1:21:46.270 --> 1:21:47.303
Will devour you.

1:21:50.930 --> 1:21:51.763
Sleep well.

1:22:31.070 --> 1:22:32.320
This is why I came here.

1:22:34.130 --> 1:22:36.880
To retrieve something and
move to a safer hiding place.

1:22:38.830 --> 1:22:41.420
Many years ago, a group of brave men

1:22:41.420 --> 1:22:43.300
were dispatched to this new world

1:22:43.300 --> 1:22:44.363
with but one task,

1:22:45.980 --> 1:22:47.550
to hide something.

1:22:47.550 --> 1:22:49.410
But their ships were caught on the ice

1:22:49.410 --> 1:22:51.270
The survivors continued inland,

1:22:51.270 --> 1:22:54.313
dying one by one until only one was left.

1:22:57.766 --> 1:23:00.332
This is what those men
gave their lives for.

1:23:03.920 --> 1:23:06.810
That last man thinking his death was near,

1:23:06.810 --> 1:23:07.863
opened this box.

1:23:09.321 --> 1:23:10.154
And what he saw

1:23:12.650 --> 1:23:13.663
cannot be described,

1:23:15.210 --> 1:23:18.551
but he knew that the box
must never be opened again.

1:23:18.551 --> 1:23:21.787
And now I'm passing it on to you.

1:23:34.185 --> 1:23:37.260
You must take it with you
and keep it your secret.

1:23:37.260 --> 1:23:39.420
Without the key, it cannot be opened.

1:23:39.420 --> 1:23:41.370
I will distract them so you can escape.

1:23:42.730 --> 1:23:45.070
- No, I don't believe any of this.

1:23:45.070 --> 1:23:46.073
You're crazy.

1:23:53.886 --> 1:23:55.712
You must go now!

1:23:58.632 --> 1:24:00.049
The box. The box!

1:24:05.899 --> 1:24:07.816
Go toward the sunlight.

1:24:09.405 --> 1:24:10.238
Go!

1:24:42.229 --> 1:24:43.062
- Rachel!

1:25:49.570 --> 1:25:51.520
Then for one

1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:53.160
beautiful moment,

1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:55.260
I thought I was about to die a quick death

1:25:56.190 --> 1:25:58.223
and that everything would be over for me.

1:25:59.443 --> 1:26:02.740
That was the last peaceful
moment I've ever known.

1:26:02.740 --> 1:26:04.040
And will likely ever know.

1:26:06.010 --> 1:26:08.197
Death is kinder than they are.

1:26:17.950 --> 1:26:20.739
- Miss, are you okay?"

1:27:11.402 --> 1:27:12.235
- Lewis?

1:27:43.786 --> 1:27:45.203
Lewis, I can't...

1:27:48.713 --> 1:27:49.833
- It's okay.

1:27:50.820 --> 1:27:53.100
It was just a dream.

1:27:53.100 --> 1:27:54.650
- Louis, please check the room.

1:27:56.950 --> 1:27:57.783
Please.

1:28:19.766 --> 1:28:21.500
You didn't check the closet.

1:28:21.500 --> 1:28:23.373
- Right. The closet.

1:28:24.340 --> 1:28:25.834
How could I forget?

1:28:31.020 --> 1:28:31.853
- What is it?

1:28:33.470 --> 1:28:34.303
What's wrong?

1:28:36.260 --> 1:28:37.113
- Just a dream.

1:28:39.100 --> 1:28:40.430
- About what?

1:28:40.430 --> 1:28:42.219
- It was about my brother.

1:28:56.744 --> 1:28:58.940
- Oh, my God. Robert.

1:28:58.940 --> 1:29:00.106
- I need to talk to you.

1:29:00.106 --> 1:29:00.939
- Come in.

1:29:06.240 --> 1:29:08.723
- No, please just leave it.

1:29:10.040 --> 1:29:10.873
- All right.

1:29:12.090 --> 1:29:12.923
Sit down.

1:29:17.440 --> 1:29:19.460
Something's happened, Robert.

1:29:19.460 --> 1:29:21.473
What is it? What's happened?

1:29:23.243 --> 1:29:25.323
- I think I'm losing my mind, Catherine.

1:29:26.857 --> 1:29:28.193
I think I'm going insane.

1:29:29.870 --> 1:29:31.920
- When's the last time you slept?

1:29:31.920 --> 1:29:34.050
- I don't know.
- Your heart's racing.

1:29:34.050 --> 1:29:35.100
Are you on something?

1:29:36.460 --> 1:29:37.460
What are you taking?

1:29:38.340 --> 1:29:41.700
- Ah, amobarbital, diphenhydramine,

1:29:41.700 --> 1:29:43.880
methamphetamine, hydroxyzine.

1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:45.720
- Jesus, Robert.

1:29:45.720 --> 1:29:47.080
You have to tell me what's going on.

1:29:47.080 --> 1:29:49.490
You have to tell me what happened.

1:29:49.490 --> 1:29:51.330
- I've discovered the truth.

1:29:51.330 --> 1:29:52.163
- What truth?

1:29:53.130 --> 1:29:54.870
- I can't tell you that.

1:29:54.870 --> 1:29:56.860
You'd be in too much danger.

1:29:56.860 --> 1:29:58.900
It's best not to know
the truth, Catherine.

1:29:58.900 --> 1:30:02.050
It's best not to see the whole picture.

1:30:02.050 --> 1:30:03.603
- You're not making any sense.

1:30:04.570 --> 1:30:05.820
- Listen to me, Catherine

1:30:07.451 --> 1:30:09.101
I have to do something important.

1:30:10.720 --> 1:30:12.230
You're going to hear things about me

1:30:12.230 --> 1:30:14.953
and I don't want you to believe them.

1:30:16.720 --> 1:30:18.923
This is the last time I'll see you.

1:30:20.310 --> 1:30:23.100
And I need to tell you
something before I go.

1:30:23.100 --> 1:30:25.200
- Robert, you have to
tell me what's going on.

1:30:25.200 --> 1:30:26.610
Are you in trouble?

1:30:26.610 --> 1:30:27.723
What's happening?

1:30:29.240 --> 1:30:31.143
What truth have you discovered?

1:30:32.290 --> 1:30:33.740
Robert, please talk to me.

1:30:33.740 --> 1:30:35.990
It will all be easier
if you just talk to me.

1:30:35.990 --> 1:30:38.190
- No, it won't!

1:30:38.190 --> 1:30:39.760
- Whatever it is, I can help.

1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:40.857
I know I can.

1:30:42.855 --> 1:30:43.855
- You can't.

1:30:47.400 --> 1:30:49.050
I put it all together, Catherine.

1:30:50.527 --> 1:30:53.643
I figured it out and now it's too late.

1:30:55.860 --> 1:30:57.631
- Figured out what?

1:30:57.631 --> 1:30:59.893
- I just came to tell you.

1:31:01.983 --> 1:31:03.233
- Tell me what?

1:31:12.247 --> 1:31:14.164
I love you, Catherine.

1:31:15.794 --> 1:31:16.961
I always have.

1:31:20.903 --> 1:31:24.877
The last thing I ever
wanted to do was hurt you.

1:31:27.660 --> 1:31:30.840
But if I don't do this,

1:31:30.840 --> 1:31:32.399
you will be hurt.

1:31:32.399 --> 1:31:33.482
- Oh, Robert.

1:31:35.547 --> 1:31:36.720
You need help.

1:31:41.400 --> 1:31:42.683
I have to call someone.

1:31:45.806 --> 1:31:46.723
Don't move.

1:32:01.210 --> 1:32:02.836
Hi, it's Catherine.

1:32:04.660 --> 1:32:06.233
Yes. I know what time it is.

1:32:07.790 --> 1:32:10.490
Listen, it's Robert.
- Robert?

1:32:10.490 --> 1:32:12.730
- He's here.
- What, now?

1:32:12.730 --> 1:32:13.647
- Yes, now.

1:32:15.350 --> 1:32:17.080
He says he knows the truth.

1:32:17.080 --> 1:32:19.050
I can't be sure but I think he's close to-

1:32:19.050 --> 1:32:20.350
Just tell
him to go home and call-

1:32:20.350 --> 1:32:23.240
- Look, I can't deal
with him all by myself.

1:32:23.240 --> 1:32:25.352
If we don't act now, we'll lose him.

1:32:25.352 --> 1:32:28.250
- All right, all right.
Just give me 20 minutes.

1:32:49.339 --> 1:32:50.422
- Oh, my God.

1:32:56.633 --> 1:32:58.791
- Catherine?

1:32:58.791 --> 1:33:00.124
What's going on?

1:33:01.028 --> 1:33:02.528
Catherine? Robert?

1:33:03.792 --> 1:33:07.253
Are you there? Pick up the phone.

1:33:07.253 --> 1:33:09.833
- There's something I've
been trying to remember.

1:33:12.540 --> 1:33:15.150
Something that happened.

1:33:15.150 --> 1:33:17.360
- You mean in one of your dreams?

1:33:17.360 --> 1:33:19.313
- No. Before that.

1:33:21.280 --> 1:33:23.290
- Something from your childhood?

1:33:23.290 --> 1:33:26.853
- No, just before I met Lewis.

1:33:30.270 --> 1:33:33.093
This is so frustrating. I'm sorry.

1:33:33.986 --> 1:33:34.836
I can't remember.

1:33:36.450 --> 1:33:38.320
- Eve, you're on the verge

1:33:38.320 --> 1:33:41.330
of a tremendous personal discovery,

1:33:41.330 --> 1:33:42.980
but something's holding you back.

1:33:44.050 --> 1:33:45.200
- I think you're right.

1:33:47.260 --> 1:33:48.820
- That makes this all the more difficult

1:33:48.820 --> 1:33:50.810
for me to have to say,

1:33:50.810 --> 1:33:53.230
but I'm afraid that this is going

1:33:53.230 --> 1:33:54.804
to have to be our last session.

1:34:01.940 --> 1:34:03.340
I'm sorry.

1:34:03.340 --> 1:34:06.423
It's just that I have my
own life to get back to.

1:34:07.920 --> 1:34:09.913
Is there another therapist you can see?

1:34:11.530 --> 1:34:13.370
- I've never been able
to open up to anyone

1:34:13.370 --> 1:34:14.580
like I have with you.

1:34:14.580 --> 1:34:15.923
- I'm glad to hear that.

1:34:17.160 --> 1:34:19.230
And I'd really like to see this through.

1:34:19.230 --> 1:34:20.573
You're so close.

1:34:27.170 --> 1:34:32.153
You know, there is one
more thing we could try.

1:34:34.010 --> 1:34:35.870
It's not standard practice,

1:34:35.870 --> 1:34:38.540
but on more than a few occasions,

1:34:38.540 --> 1:34:40.750
I've used hypnosis on my patients

1:34:41.610 --> 1:34:44.010
and quite successfully, I might add.

1:34:44.010 --> 1:34:45.310
- I don't know about that.

1:34:46.730 --> 1:34:49.030
- Forget all that stuff
you see in the movies.

1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:52.950
Hypnosis is a powerful tool.

1:34:52.950 --> 1:34:57.250
It will help you remember the
things you need to remember.

1:35:03.380 --> 1:35:05.853
If you're not comfortable, I understand.

1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:11.023
But otherwise, we've
gone as far as we can go.

1:35:15.300 --> 1:35:16.233
It's up to you.

1:35:18.900 --> 1:35:19.733
- All right.

1:35:21.090 --> 1:35:24.213
- I want to apologize to
whoever gets this message.

1:35:26.488 --> 1:35:29.843
I want to apologize for
destroying your life.

1:36:12.970 --> 1:36:15.178
- There's someone else in the room.

1:36:15.178 --> 1:36:16.011
Eve!

1:36:19.190 --> 1:36:20.023
Eve!

1:36:22.570 --> 1:36:23.570
- Doctor go?

1:36:37.725 --> 1:36:41.834
Eve?

1:36:51.169 --> 1:36:53.474
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1:36:53.474 --> 1:36:54.641
Let go of her!

1:36:58.064 --> 1:37:00.083
Get off of her! Let her go!

1:37:04.718 --> 1:37:05.551
Stop it!

1:37:11.477 --> 1:37:12.310
- Oh, God.

1:37:13.444 --> 1:37:14.284
Oh, God.

1:37:44.677 --> 1:37:46.344
- We're out of here.

1:37:47.689 --> 1:37:48.856
- Is she dead?

1:37:50.003 --> 1:37:51.490
- I don't know.

1:38:03.187 --> 1:38:04.773
It guards our thoughts.

1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:07.240
Keeps them out of our heads.

1:38:21.330 --> 1:38:25.033
The answer is in that
box, but we need the key.

1:38:26.650 --> 1:38:29.003
And the key is in those woods.

1:38:30.200 --> 1:38:34.947
Jane Palmer, Michael Ballard, Roger Keith.

1:38:39.370 --> 1:38:40.287
My brother.

1:38:43.987 --> 1:38:44.987
My brother.

1:38:47.916 --> 1:38:51.002
They all found something out.

1:38:51.002 --> 1:38:53.238
But they got too close to the truth

1:38:53.238 --> 1:38:54.588
and they couldn't handle it

1:38:56.847 --> 1:38:58.820
because it wasn't meant for them.

1:38:58.820 --> 1:38:59.820
It was meant for us.

1:39:00.850 --> 1:39:02.650
We were singled out for some reason.

1:39:09.252 --> 1:39:10.252
I love you.

1:39:13.562 --> 1:39:15.412
From the first moment I ever saw you.

1:39:17.120 --> 1:39:19.143
From the first moment I heard your voice.

1:39:21.972 --> 1:39:23.460
I've always loved you.

1:39:35.015 --> 1:39:36.932
- We're being followed.

1:39:40.814 --> 1:39:42.564
- I don't see anyone.

1:40:12.907 --> 1:40:14.553
Just like Jane Palmer wrote.

1:40:42.030 --> 1:40:44.480
- We should turn back.

1:40:44.480 --> 1:40:45.313
- This way.

1:41:30.313 --> 1:41:31.813
He's got the key.

1:41:51.187 --> 1:41:52.583
- You're not gonna open it.

1:41:56.481 --> 1:41:57.996
What?

1:41:57.996 --> 1:41:58.829
- Listen.

1:42:02.434 --> 1:42:04.457
- Are there children...

1:42:04.457 --> 1:42:05.857
Are there children out here?

1:42:07.250 --> 1:42:08.083
- Come on.

1:42:38.169 --> 1:42:39.409
- I knew you'd come.

1:42:45.500 --> 1:42:46.383
Sooner or later.

1:42:50.810 --> 1:42:52.200
- You're not my brother.

1:42:53.610 --> 1:42:56.823
- Don't you mean half-brother?

1:42:58.670 --> 1:42:59.823
- You're not him.

1:43:01.049 --> 1:43:04.280
- I thought you would have
figured it out by now, Lewis.

1:43:04.280 --> 1:43:05.833
The world is not what it seems.

1:43:06.980 --> 1:43:08.370
You haven't opened it yet.

1:43:08.370 --> 1:43:09.733
- No.

1:43:09.733 --> 1:43:12.490
- Then why don't you
just give it to me then

1:43:12.490 --> 1:43:14.590
and save yourself some grief.

1:43:14.590 --> 1:43:15.423
- No.

1:43:16.730 --> 1:43:18.610
- Lewis, if you knew what was in that box,

1:43:18.610 --> 1:43:19.810
you'd turn to jelly.

1:43:19.810 --> 1:43:23.763
So do yourself a favor
and just hand it over.

1:43:24.600 --> 1:43:26.010
No questions asked.

1:43:26.010 --> 1:43:27.443
- And none answered either.

1:43:28.660 --> 1:43:30.373
- Give me the goddamn box!

1:43:33.870 --> 1:43:34.703
Okay.

1:43:36.849 --> 1:43:40.720
Lewis, you've done well to get this far.

1:43:40.720 --> 1:43:41.553
I mean it.

1:43:43.730 --> 1:43:46.130
Our father would be proud of you.

1:43:46.130 --> 1:43:46.963
But the game is over.

1:43:46.963 --> 1:43:48.503
- This isn't a game.

1:43:49.661 --> 1:43:50.903
- Of course it's a game.

1:43:52.100 --> 1:43:52.933
Think about it.

1:43:54.990 --> 1:43:56.280
Catherine could have taken the box

1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:59.470
from you right away, back at the house.

1:43:59.470 --> 1:44:00.430
- But she didn't.

1:44:00.430 --> 1:44:02.020
There must be a reason.

1:44:02.020 --> 1:44:03.370
- Of course there's a reason.

1:44:03.370 --> 1:44:06.160
It'd be like taking candy from a baby.

1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:07.840
Where's the fun in that?

1:44:07.840 --> 1:44:08.884
- Fun?

1:44:08.884 --> 1:44:12.210
We love watching
people go over the edge.

1:44:12.210 --> 1:44:13.823
When their world falls apart,

1:44:14.970 --> 1:44:15.970
like yours did, Lewis,

1:44:15.970 --> 1:44:17.670
when you found Catherine with Eve.

1:44:19.300 --> 1:44:20.850
She doesn't sound like that with you.

1:44:20.850 --> 1:44:21.683
Does she?

1:44:22.960 --> 1:44:25.970
In fact, you've never
even given her an orgasm.

1:44:25.970 --> 1:44:27.140
- That's not true.

1:44:27.140 --> 1:44:28.420
- Well, that's what you told your doctor.

1:44:28.420 --> 1:44:29.453
Don't you remember?

1:44:30.430 --> 1:44:32.743
Oh, I'm sorry.

1:44:33.630 --> 1:44:35.830
That was supposed to
be a secret, wasn't it?

1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:38.393
Oh, well that's okay.

1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:40.830
She wasn't a real doctor

1:44:43.300 --> 1:44:44.800
and you're not a real patient.

1:44:46.690 --> 1:44:48.433
Playing doctor sure is fun.

1:44:49.620 --> 1:44:50.453
- Who are you?

1:44:55.286 --> 1:44:57.286
- Who do you think I am?

1:44:58.700 --> 1:45:00.670
- Tell me who you are.

1:45:00.670 --> 1:45:02.500
Tell me what you want.

1:45:02.500 --> 1:45:04.460
- I can't just tell you.

1:45:04.460 --> 1:45:05.833
If you want those answers,

1:45:08.110 --> 1:45:09.510
you'll have to open the box,

1:45:10.350 --> 1:45:11.183
but I warn you,

1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:15.230
you won't like what you find.

1:45:15.230 --> 1:45:16.740
- You're full of shit.

1:45:16.740 --> 1:45:18.080
- Lewis, you got two choices.

1:45:18.080 --> 1:45:20.250
You can give me the box and the key

1:45:20.250 --> 1:45:24.610
and then see if you can find
your way out of these woods,

1:45:24.610 --> 1:45:26.467
find your car and go home.

1:45:26.467 --> 1:45:28.140
And then you can try to lead a normal life

1:45:28.140 --> 1:45:31.043
as if there none of this ever happened.

1:45:33.360 --> 1:45:34.660
I wish you luck with that.

1:45:35.950 --> 1:45:37.250
- Give him the box, Lewis.

1:45:38.468 --> 1:45:40.010
I wanna go home.

1:45:40.010 --> 1:45:42.450
- Or? The second choice?

1:45:42.450 --> 1:45:44.253
- I wanna go home, Lewis. Please.

1:45:46.040 --> 1:45:50.673
- Or you can open the box.

1:45:53.040 --> 1:45:54.683
You can finally know the truth.

1:45:57.150 --> 1:45:58.023
The whole story.

1:46:00.680 --> 1:46:02.680
Things your brother could only guess at.

1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:08.493
You can know things
that no one else knows.

1:46:10.110 --> 1:46:10.943
- Lewis.

1:46:13.200 --> 1:46:15.100
I don't want you to know those things.

1:46:16.340 --> 1:46:17.363
- What's the catch?

1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:19.633
- No catch.

1:46:20.490 --> 1:46:24.013
Well, one catch, I suppose.

1:46:25.260 --> 1:46:26.960
The truth will either set you free

1:46:29.620 --> 1:46:31.520
or it will destroy you,

1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:34.233
because once you know the truth,

1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:37.513
you can not know it.

1:46:39.400 --> 1:46:40.980
Do you know what I mean?

1:46:40.980 --> 1:46:43.480
- Yes. I know what you mean.

1:46:43.480 --> 1:46:44.950
- I thought you would.

1:46:44.950 --> 1:46:47.640
You can try to fool yourself
or convince yourself otherwise,

1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:50.633
but once that box is opened,

1:46:51.820 --> 1:46:52.920
there's no closing it.

1:46:55.947 --> 1:46:57.897
And it can be lonely knowing the truth.

1:47:00.420 --> 1:47:01.527
It can be very lonely.

1:47:06.152 --> 1:47:08.453
- Lewis, please.

1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:11.330
- All kidding aside, Lewis.

1:47:11.330 --> 1:47:13.950
I wouldn't open that box if I was you.

1:47:13.950 --> 1:47:14.990
Some people just

1:47:17.380 --> 1:47:19.289
aren't cut out for the truth.

1:47:22.760 --> 1:47:23.760
- Lewis, no.

1:47:23.760 --> 1:47:24.690
- I've got to know.

1:47:24.690 --> 1:47:26.850
- Don't.
- It's just a box.

1:47:26.850 --> 1:47:28.823
What could possibly be in it?

1:47:33.177 --> 1:47:34.094
No.

1:48:16.531 --> 1:48:20.279
hearts from the wounds

1:48:22.935 --> 1:48:27.401
bones, blood and snow

1:49:56.430 --> 1:49:57.930
- Don't say I didn't warn you.

1:49:58.910 --> 1:50:00.560
- Lewis.

1:50:00.560 --> 1:50:02.597
Why are you looking at me like that?

1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:05.793
- Because he knows the truth.

1:50:08.000 --> 1:50:09.823
- What do you mean?

1:50:09.823 --> 1:50:12.963
- Eve. Look inside yourself.

1:50:14.970 --> 1:50:16.203
You know the truth too.

1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:19.073
- No.

1:50:20.170 --> 1:50:21.003
- Yes.

1:50:23.440 --> 1:50:24.920
Yes.

1:50:24.920 --> 1:50:26.453
- Leave her alone.
- Why?

1:50:27.380 --> 1:50:28.890
She has no feelings.

1:50:28.890 --> 1:50:30.033
- I have feelings.

1:50:31.750 --> 1:50:33.370
I'm a person.

1:50:33.370 --> 1:50:35.370
My life is important too.

1:50:35.370 --> 1:50:36.950
- What life?

1:50:36.950 --> 1:50:38.880
You're just a picture in a magazine.

1:50:38.880 --> 1:50:39.780
- Leave her alone.

1:50:40.830 --> 1:50:43.430
- I told you not to open the box, Lewis.

1:50:43.430 --> 1:50:45.060
You could have gone on living the dream,

1:50:45.060 --> 1:50:48.223
but no, you had to know the truth.

1:50:49.099 --> 1:50:53.729
- I'm a person.

1:50:53.729 --> 1:50:54.896
I am a person.

1:50:58.120 --> 1:50:58.953
- Are you sure?

1:51:02.570 --> 1:51:04.770
- I'm real and I'm not
gonna listen to this.

1:51:06.223 --> 1:51:08.670
- Would a real person worry so much

1:51:08.670 --> 1:51:10.553
about whether she was real or not?

1:51:13.512 --> 1:51:14.812
- You can't do this to me.

1:51:17.360 --> 1:51:18.193
- Why not?

1:51:19.350 --> 1:51:20.183
You're nothing.

1:51:24.010 --> 1:51:25.060
Nothing.

1:51:25.060 --> 1:51:25.893
- Stop it.

1:51:28.900 --> 1:51:30.500
Or I'll kill you.

1:51:30.500 --> 1:51:32.450
- You better say bye to
your dream girl first.

1:51:32.450 --> 1:51:33.503
- Just shut up!

1:51:36.260 --> 1:51:38.650
- Do you really think somebody
could dial the wrong number

1:51:38.650 --> 1:51:40.350
and reach you on the brink of suicide,

1:51:40.350 --> 1:51:43.390
and it just happens to be
the girl of your dreams

1:51:43.390 --> 1:51:44.643
and she's single?

1:51:46.490 --> 1:51:49.593
Why would someone like
her love someone like you?

1:51:50.450 --> 1:51:51.950
You know the truth, don't you?

1:51:53.360 --> 1:51:54.583
You know she's not real.

1:51:56.260 --> 1:51:57.803
She's too good to be true.

1:52:00.710 --> 1:52:01.910
It's just like you said,

1:52:02.877 --> 1:52:06.367
"After we made her, we broke the mold."

1:52:07.480 --> 1:52:11.503
- No, Lewis, you didn't say that.

1:52:14.490 --> 1:52:15.890
Tell me you didn't say that.

1:52:25.194 --> 1:52:26.930
- Where is she?

1:52:26.930 --> 1:52:28.011
Where'd she go?

1:52:28.011 --> 1:52:31.210
Who might you be talking about?

1:52:31.210 --> 1:52:32.200
- Where is she?

1:52:32.200 --> 1:52:34.510
- You should see the look on your face.

1:52:34.510 --> 1:52:36.313
- Tell me where she is.

1:52:38.350 --> 1:52:39.500
Please.

1:52:39.500 --> 1:52:41.023
- She's gone, Lewis.

1:52:42.580 --> 1:52:43.733
She's gone.

1:52:55.780 --> 1:52:57.280
- Why would you do this to me?

1:52:59.060 --> 1:53:00.640
- Why do people

1:53:02.720 --> 1:53:04.047
go fishing?

1:53:17.481 --> 1:53:18.398
- Eve? Eve?

1:53:20.189 --> 1:53:21.365
Eve!

1:53:34.650 --> 1:53:35.483
Eve!

1:57:33.364 --> 1:57:38.364
by the ancient voice

1:58:10.409 --> 1:58:15.409
felt about each other
