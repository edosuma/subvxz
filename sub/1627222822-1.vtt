00:17.209 --> 00:19.045
342 niner, we've
got a report of a disturbance

00:19.078 --> 00:22.481
at the west corner of
Eastwood and Pine, respond.

01:17.904 --> 01:19.772
Unit six to dispatch.

01:19.806 --> 01:21.174
Go ahead, unit six.

01:21.206 --> 01:23.843
I'm on Polk and Johnson
with a blue Subaru

01:23.876 --> 01:28.114
out with HPR0612,
faulty break lights.

01:30.016 --> 01:31.184
Unit
six, be advised,

01:31.216 --> 01:32.952
that vehicle's been
reported stolen.

01:32.985 --> 01:34.187
Proceed with caution.

01:43.196 --> 01:44.362
Get back, hey!

01:47.967 --> 01:48.768
Oh god.

03:39.278 --> 03:40.378
Same dream?

03:41.681 --> 03:42.514
Yeah.

03:43.481 --> 03:45.017
Oh, you're gonna be okay.

03:46.585 --> 03:48.453
It's just gonna take some time.

03:48.486 --> 03:49.588
Be all right.

03:52.557 --> 03:53.993
I don't think
I'm gonna be able

03:54.026 --> 03:55.493
to put that uniform
back on again.

03:56.696 --> 03:57.864
In time you will.

03:59.332 --> 04:02.434
And if you decide that you
wanna do something else,

04:02.467 --> 04:05.604
I'm right behind you,
whatever you decide.

04:10.575 --> 04:12.745
At least this time
I didn't see his face.

04:13.646 --> 04:14.914
Well, that's good.

04:14.947 --> 04:16.615
That's progress, right?

04:16.649 --> 04:18.351
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:18.382 --> 04:19.218
I think so.

04:21.286 --> 04:22.520
You know, every
time this happens,

04:22.554 --> 04:25.124
you don't gotta come
running to save me.

04:25.157 --> 04:26.192
But I'm glad you did.

04:27.860 --> 04:28.694
I'm here.

04:30.029 --> 04:31.429
I'm here for you.

04:32.597 --> 04:34.566
I'm not gonna give
up on you, Jack.

04:36.235 --> 04:37.602
It's okay.

04:37.637 --> 04:39.939
Let's go to bed, okay?

04:39.972 --> 04:42.074
Come on, let's go to bed.

05:04.130 --> 05:06.232
Welcome to group, guys.

05:06.265 --> 05:08.100
We got a special
guest with us today.

05:09.735 --> 05:11.637
This is Mr. Jack Rollins.

05:11.671 --> 05:14.206
Jack is gonna sit in with us.

05:15.573 --> 05:17.243
Gonna see what we're
about and see if he wants

05:17.276 --> 05:19.879
to become a little more
permanent member of our group.

05:19.912 --> 05:23.316
Want everybody to give a
good warm welcome to Jack.

05:23.349 --> 05:25.318
- Welcome, Jack.
- I'm glad you're here.

05:25.351 --> 05:26.152
Thank you.

05:27.619 --> 05:30.588
Now, Jack, usually when
we start these things off,

05:30.622 --> 05:32.692
we wanna ask you to just
give us a little background,

05:32.725 --> 05:35.227
just tell us who you are, a
little bit about yourself.

05:38.496 --> 05:40.933
I'm Jack, and

05:45.204 --> 05:47.306
I was in the military.

05:47.340 --> 05:48.975
Really, what branch?

05:49.008 --> 05:50.508
Army.

05:50.542 --> 05:51.811
I was a Ranger.

05:51.844 --> 05:53.179
Hoorah.

05:53.212 --> 05:57.283
- Thank you for your service.
- Thank you.

05:57.316 --> 06:00.786
Then I ended up getting
married and moved back here,

06:00.820 --> 06:01.619
became a cop.

06:03.122 --> 06:06.425
I'm not currently a cop,
I'm actually on a sabbatical

06:06.459 --> 06:07.460
after what happened.

06:09.462 --> 06:12.098
I wanna be a cop again,
I just don't think

06:13.466 --> 06:16.035
I'm ready to put the
uniform back on just yet.

06:17.737 --> 06:21.340
This was my wife's
idea, to be here.

06:21.374 --> 06:23.809
But I mean, I'm not saying
I don't wanna be here.

06:26.479 --> 06:27.313
I do.

06:28.748 --> 06:31.851
She thought it would help, and
I figured it couldn't hurt,

06:31.884 --> 06:33.019
so here I am.

06:34.854 --> 06:35.688
Guess that's it.

06:37.990 --> 06:39.992
Man, we're just
glad that you're here.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.095
And we want you to know
that every one of us,

06:43.129 --> 06:45.031
me included, we're
here for a reason.

06:46.531 --> 06:50.002
We've all got demons,
we've all got issues.

06:50.036 --> 06:53.739
And, you know,
maybe by being here,

06:53.773 --> 06:56.142
this is gonna help lift
that burden off you enough

06:56.175 --> 06:58.110
that you can function, man.

06:59.512 --> 07:01.080
Hopefully, in time, you
know, you're gonna be here,

07:01.113 --> 07:02.248
and you're gonna recognize us

07:02.281 --> 07:04.483
as not just a little
therapy group,

07:04.517 --> 07:08.187
not just as some people sitting
here running their mouths,

07:08.220 --> 07:12.224
but as family and friends, and
people that you can come to

07:12.258 --> 07:16.594
to help lift that
burden off of you.

07:16.629 --> 07:19.799
Now, usually at this
time, I'm gonna ask,

07:19.832 --> 07:22.968
you know, maybe that you
would share a little bit

07:23.002 --> 07:25.738
about why you're here,
what brought you to us.

07:25.771 --> 07:30.242
Now you can or you can
not, this is your decision.

07:32.445 --> 07:34.180
I think I'm just
gonna sit this one out,

07:34.213 --> 07:35.314
if that's okay.

07:36.715 --> 07:37.582
Maybe next time.

07:40.052 --> 07:43.189
Okay, that's perfectly fine.

07:43.222 --> 07:47.426
This is about you being
comfortable opening up to us.

07:47.460 --> 07:52.465
Larry, man, why don't
you kick this thing off?

07:53.132 --> 07:53.966
I'm Larry.

07:56.001 --> 07:58.537
Military myself, Special Forces.

07:58.571 --> 08:00.906
From Vietnam all
the way to Grenada.

08:09.582 --> 08:10.416
Thanks, man.

08:25.197 --> 08:26.365
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:26.398 --> 08:28.000
How did it go?

08:28.033 --> 08:29.268
It was okay.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.903
Just okay?

08:30.936 --> 08:33.072
I mean, are you gonna
go back next week?

08:33.105 --> 08:35.307
Yeah, I'm giving it a shot.

08:35.341 --> 08:37.809
- Good.
- Nice group of people there.

08:37.842 --> 08:40.913
Good, well, I'm proud
of you for going today.

08:40.946 --> 08:42.648
Don't be proud of me just yet,

08:42.681 --> 08:44.250
I don't know if this
is gonna help or not.

08:44.283 --> 08:46.652
Still, though, I
mean, first steps.

08:46.685 --> 08:48.254
I'm just proud of you.

08:48.287 --> 08:49.121
Thanks.

08:50.289 --> 08:51.757
That right there helps
more than anything.

08:51.790 --> 08:54.026
Well, there's some more
where that came from.

08:54.059 --> 08:55.728
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

08:59.365 --> 09:03.369
♪ Happy birthday dear Aaron ♪

09:03.402 --> 09:06.739
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

09:10.644 --> 09:12.545
- Happy birthday, Aaron.
- Thank you.

09:15.014 --> 09:16.382
Hey buddy, thanks for coming.

09:16.415 --> 09:17.816
Happy birthday.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.852
- Have fun.
- Drive safe.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.389
Brother, have a
seat for a minute.

09:30.296 --> 09:32.798
So what time you
heading out tomorrow?

09:32.831 --> 09:34.400
First thing in the morning.

09:34.433 --> 09:36.869
Already got all my gear loaded.

09:36.902 --> 09:37.736
You excited?

09:39.438 --> 09:41.140
You have no idea.

09:41.173 --> 09:44.543
I've been waiting a
long time for this.

09:44.577 --> 09:45.844
I'm ready to go.

09:47.079 --> 09:47.947
I bet you are.

09:50.449 --> 09:52.318
You know, it's
not my first rodeo.

09:52.351 --> 09:54.353
I'm not gonna try to
do the whole trail.

09:55.521 --> 09:57.223
How often you gotta
check in with Christine?

09:57.256 --> 09:58.757
I'll check in
with her every day.

09:58.791 --> 10:00.759
I got me a satellite phone.

10:00.793 --> 10:02.895
There's no cell
service up there, so...

10:08.000 --> 10:09.669
How'd your first
day at group go?

10:11.270 --> 10:12.104
Oh.

10:13.172 --> 10:14.240
Jury's still out.

10:17.476 --> 10:20.479
Well hang in there,
brother, give it time.

10:20.512 --> 10:22.147
I was proud of you
for giving it a chance

10:22.181 --> 10:23.249
in the first place.

10:24.483 --> 10:26.885
You know, it was really
good seeing you laughing

10:26.919 --> 10:29.355
and cutting up tonight.

10:29.388 --> 10:31.190
You hadn't done
that in a long time.

10:32.358 --> 10:33.926
It's good to have
my brother back.

10:37.363 --> 10:38.163
I'm trying.

10:39.398 --> 10:40.966
That's all you can do.

10:44.536 --> 10:45.971
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

10:46.005 --> 10:48.307
- You ready to go?
- If you are.

10:48.340 --> 10:50.242
That means she's ready.

10:51.810 --> 10:53.747
We're gonna get out your hair.

10:55.814 --> 10:57.283
- Be careful out there.
- I will, brother.

10:57.316 --> 10:59.118
And don't take any chances.

10:59.151 --> 11:00.352
- Me?
- Yeah.

11:00.386 --> 11:02.221
No, no way.

11:02.254 --> 11:03.690
- See you later, man.
- All right.

11:03.723 --> 11:04.923
Bye.

11:04.957 --> 11:06.091
And take plenty
of pictures, too.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.326
- I'll do that.
- Okay.

11:09.261 --> 11:10.829
Just not of yourself naked.

11:27.112 --> 11:30.115
It is definitely
beautiful out here.

11:30.149 --> 11:31.950
Yes it is.

11:35.621 --> 11:37.956
Uh oh, I recognize that look.

11:38.991 --> 11:40.592
It's gonna be okay.

11:40.627 --> 11:42.394
It's not like I'm
going off to war.

11:43.595 --> 11:44.930
I know the Lord's
going to protect you,

11:44.963 --> 11:46.398
but I'm just gonna miss you.

11:47.866 --> 11:50.135
Well, they say absence
makes the heart grow fonder,

11:50.169 --> 11:53.005
maybe you'll love me more
by the time I get back.

11:54.306 --> 11:55.775
I don't think that's possible,

11:55.809 --> 11:58.577
because, you know, you're
already a 10 on my fine scale.

12:00.279 --> 12:01.046
I know.

12:02.047 --> 12:03.482
You know I really need this.

12:04.350 --> 12:06.585
I know you do, but promise me

12:06.618 --> 12:09.021
that you're gonna
call me every night.

12:09.955 --> 12:11.156
I promise I will.

12:11.190 --> 12:13.559
Okay, please be careful.

12:13.592 --> 12:15.027
Always.

12:15.060 --> 12:15.894
I love you.

12:16.895 --> 12:18.597
I better get rolling.

12:18.631 --> 12:19.465
Love you.

12:29.843 --> 12:32.712
You drive careful, and
no texting while you drive.

12:33.612 --> 12:35.715
- Okay.
- I love you.

12:35.749 --> 12:38.016
Love you too.

13:50.155 --> 13:52.591
Ah, this is gonna
be a good one.

16:05.324 --> 16:06.291
Hey, love.

16:07.559 --> 16:08.828
Hey, how you doing?

16:09.963 --> 16:12.130
Oh, I'm just
checking my messages.

16:12.999 --> 16:14.801
How's it going out there?

16:14.834 --> 16:16.468
It's going good.

16:16.501 --> 16:18.738
Did you cover a
lot of ground today?

16:18.771 --> 16:21.074
Yeah, I got about
10 miles in today.

16:21.106 --> 16:24.043
Man, I tell you, I feel
every bit of it, too.

16:24.077 --> 16:25.477
Ooh, my dogs are barking.

16:30.582 --> 16:31.918
What was that?

16:32.819 --> 16:34.821
I don't know.

16:34.854 --> 16:36.288
You heard that?

16:36.321 --> 16:37.155
Yeah.

16:38.190 --> 16:39.759
Was that an owl or something?

16:41.728 --> 16:43.062
I'm not sure what it was.

16:46.298 --> 16:47.132
Are you there?

16:48.400 --> 16:52.137
Yeah, yeah, I
was just listening.

16:52.170 --> 16:54.506
I don't hear it now, I
don't know what it was.

16:56.208 --> 16:58.210
Anyways, how was your day?

16:58.243 --> 17:00.013
Same old, same old.

17:00.046 --> 17:02.682
I did get the house clean today.

17:02.715 --> 17:03.850
Good, good.

17:05.785 --> 17:08.387
I guess I better get off
of here, save this battery.

17:08.420 --> 17:09.989
I just wanted to
call and check in

17:10.022 --> 17:12.324
and let you know
everything went okay today.

17:13.693 --> 17:15.694
I'll talk
to you tomorrow night.

17:15.728 --> 17:18.530
- All right, good night.
- I love you.

19:00.365 --> 19:01.134
Aaron?

19:02.267 --> 19:03.102
Christine?

19:04.269 --> 19:05.604
What's
the matter, honey?

19:07.272 --> 19:09.008
I don't know, it's
probably nothing.

19:10.575 --> 19:12.577
Tell me, what's going on?

19:14.312 --> 19:18.283
I don't know, I'm hearing
these weird noises out in the,

19:18.316 --> 19:19.719
out in the woods,
and there's something

19:19.752 --> 19:21.286
walking around out there.

19:21.319 --> 19:23.689
Do you think it's a
person messing with you?

19:23.723 --> 19:24.523
Another hiker?

19:26.591 --> 19:28.426
I don't know, maybe.

19:28.460 --> 19:32.765
I haven't really seen any
sign of anybody else up here.

19:34.399 --> 19:35.635
I took a selfie this morning,

19:35.668 --> 19:39.304
and there was something
in the background.

19:39.337 --> 19:41.641
What did you see?

19:41.674 --> 19:43.475
I don't know what it was,
I couldn't make it out,

19:43.508 --> 19:45.211
but it was big.

19:46.746 --> 19:47.980
I thought maybe it was a bear,

19:48.014 --> 19:50.582
but it wasn't really
shaped like a bear,

19:50.615 --> 19:54.553
and it looked like
it was watching me.

19:54.586 --> 19:56.454
Maybe you ought to
just cut the trip short

19:56.488 --> 19:57.824
and come home tomorrow.

19:59.258 --> 20:00.092
Maybe.

20:01.326 --> 20:03.328
I'll decide in the morning.

20:03.361 --> 20:05.031
If anything happens,

20:05.064 --> 20:07.266
call me back and I'll
call in the calvary.

20:07.300 --> 20:09.101
Okay, I will.

20:09.135 --> 20:10.236
I love you, Aaron.

20:11.270 --> 20:12.138
I love you too.

20:13.272 --> 20:14.941
I'll talk to you later, bye.

20:40.867 --> 20:43.002
My name is Aaron Rollins.

20:43.035 --> 20:44.837
I'm making this video
because I don't know

20:44.871 --> 20:46.672
what's gonna happen
to me tonight.

20:48.074 --> 20:51.310
There's something out
there, it's getting closer.

20:53.746 --> 20:55.281
If anybody finds this video,

20:58.251 --> 20:59.785
tell my wife that I love her.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.823
I'm gonna put this in my
pocket and keep it running,

21:04.957 --> 21:06.158
and I'm gonna go out there,

21:06.192 --> 21:07.425
and I'm gonna face
whatever it is.

21:19.372 --> 21:21.140
I have a gun, if this
is some kind of a joke,

21:21.173 --> 21:22.375
you better knock it off!

22:15.527 --> 22:16.362
Jack.

22:17.363 --> 22:18.530
Christine called.

22:19.464 --> 22:20.498
It's about Aaron.

22:21.767 --> 22:23.369
- What happened?
- He's missing.

22:23.402 --> 22:25.470
He hadn't checked in
in the last two days.

22:25.503 --> 22:26.706
Oh god.

22:26.739 --> 22:28.741
I was afraid something
like this might happen.

22:28.774 --> 22:30.710
Come on, let's get over there.

22:32.078 --> 22:34.113
Let's not jump to
any conclusions here.

22:34.146 --> 22:36.382
I'm sure the sat phone
battery probably died.

22:37.249 --> 22:38.616
Guys, I'm sure he's okay.

22:38.651 --> 22:41.754
I mean, maybe he just
dropped it or it broke.

22:41.787 --> 22:44.323
I'm sure there's a logical
explanation for all this.

22:44.357 --> 22:47.460
Aaron's a big boy, he knows
how to take care of himself.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.995
But what if he's hurt, Jack?

22:49.028 --> 22:51.197
What if he can't get
to the satellite phone?

22:53.265 --> 22:55.234
I'm gonna call the
sheriff in that county

22:55.267 --> 22:57.236
and I'm gonna
report him missing.

22:57.269 --> 23:00.172
It's been 48 hours.

23:00.206 --> 23:02.375
He'd have called me if he could.

23:03.242 --> 23:05.077
Okay, make the call.

24:06.604 --> 24:09.108
Is this your brother's tent?

24:10.142 --> 24:11.710
Aaron!

24:11.744 --> 24:13.345
Aaron!

24:15.214 --> 24:16.916
He's not here, Christine.

24:16.949 --> 24:19.385
He's dead, isn't he?

24:19.418 --> 24:21.921
Christine, we don't know that.

24:21.954 --> 24:24.857
What
could've done this?

24:24.890 --> 24:27.359
Is this your husband's
handgun, ma'am?

24:27.393 --> 24:30.696
Yes, and he wouldn't
have left his gun.

24:30.729 --> 24:33.399
Oh, Aaron, oh, god, no.

24:33.432 --> 24:35.234
Could a black
bear have done this?

24:36.601 --> 24:38.838
Could be, they're pretty
common in this area.

24:38.871 --> 24:41.207
But where's Aaron?

24:41.240 --> 24:43.109
Where's my husband?

24:43.142 --> 24:44.844
We're gonna
continue the search.

24:47.079 --> 24:48.581
I don't see any bear tracks.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.551
Hey, Dwight!

24:52.585 --> 24:55.087
I just found this phone
about 50 yards off the trail.

24:55.121 --> 24:56.288
That's Aaron's phone.

24:57.490 --> 25:00.226
We may need it back,
but you take it, ma'am.

25:00.259 --> 25:01.794
Let's concentrate our search
up there to the north.

25:01.827 --> 25:03.529
And there's a video on here!

25:05.264 --> 25:07.032
Wait, what?

25:07.066 --> 25:09.201
I have a gun, if
this is some kind of a joke,

25:09.235 --> 25:10.202
you better knock it off!

25:11.637 --> 25:12.805
Are those gunshots?

25:14.540 --> 25:15.908
What's he shooting at?

25:15.941 --> 25:16.976
It's too dark.

25:17.009 --> 25:18.711
I can't tell, either.

25:18.744 --> 25:20.212
It's gone.

25:20.246 --> 25:22.248
We're gonna continue the search,
he could still be alive, ma'am.

25:22.281 --> 25:23.449
No, he's gone!

25:24.583 --> 25:25.618
He's gone.

25:25.651 --> 25:27.253
- Oh god.
- Take it easy, ma'am.

25:27.286 --> 25:28.954
Got you, get her up.

25:31.624 --> 25:32.892
We got you.

25:32.925 --> 25:36.262
Hey, just get her
back to the car, okay?

25:37.596 --> 25:40.332
He's gone!

25:40.366 --> 25:41.200
He's gone!

25:59.685 --> 26:01.020
He's at it again?

26:01.053 --> 26:03.756
Okay, we'll send
somebody right out there.

26:03.789 --> 26:04.623
Thanks.

26:11.230 --> 26:12.131
Good morning.

26:12.164 --> 26:13.365
Good morning, Mr. Rollins.

26:13.399 --> 26:14.733
I'm here to get
my brother's stuff.

26:14.767 --> 26:15.935
All right, I've
got that over here,

26:15.968 --> 26:17.736
let me get it for you.

26:22.775 --> 26:25.010
We've got everything in
there, including his pistol.

26:25.044 --> 26:26.912
It's unloaded, of course.

26:26.946 --> 26:28.614
Except for that tent.

26:28.648 --> 26:30.115
Condition it was in,
I really didn't think

26:30.149 --> 26:31.951
you'd be wanting it back.

26:31.984 --> 26:35.020
That's okay, I don't need it.

26:35.054 --> 26:37.056
Y'all
about to head home?

26:37.089 --> 26:38.791
The wives are, but
I wanna hang around

26:38.824 --> 26:40.826
a little bit longer,
search a bit more.

26:40.859 --> 26:41.994
Oh, you are.

26:43.229 --> 26:45.464
Mr. Rollins, I
hope you understand

26:45.497 --> 26:48.968
that that's such a huge area
of wilderness out there,

26:49.001 --> 26:50.569
it's about like
being lost at sea.

26:50.603 --> 26:53.707
You're highly unlikely
to find anything.

26:53.739 --> 26:55.808
Yeah, I know, but
he's my brother.

26:55.841 --> 26:56.809
I gotta try.

26:58.143 --> 27:00.246
Well, understood.

27:00.279 --> 27:03.148
I guess if it was my brother
I'd be doing the same thing.

27:03.182 --> 27:04.583
How long you think
you're gonna take?

27:04.617 --> 27:06.018
A couple days at the most.

27:07.419 --> 27:09.855
All right, you know that
satellite phone was destroyed

27:09.888 --> 27:13.325
and there is no cell phone
coverage up there at all.

27:13.359 --> 27:15.060
Could you stop back by
here and let us know

27:15.094 --> 27:16.428
everything's all right
before you head home?

27:16.462 --> 27:17.796
I can do that.

27:17.830 --> 27:19.431
Thank you, Sheriff,
I appreciate it.

27:19.465 --> 27:21.066
- Good luck to you.
- Yes, sir.

27:29.942 --> 27:32.679
Black bear attack
is very uncommon in this area,

27:32.712 --> 27:34.648
but when it does occur,
it's highly unlikely

27:34.681 --> 27:36.482
that there'd be any survivors.

27:36.515 --> 27:37.651
Our hearts and prayers do go out

27:37.684 --> 27:39.518
to the Rollins
family at this time.

27:39.551 --> 27:42.321
But the body of
Aaron Rollins is still missing.

27:42.354 --> 27:44.323
Well, I do realize
that finding a body

27:44.356 --> 27:45.491
is something that's
very important

27:45.524 --> 27:46.825
for closure for the family,

27:46.859 --> 27:48.961
but this is such a vast
area of wilderness.

27:48.994 --> 27:51.063
Our manpower and
resources are short,

27:51.096 --> 27:53.132
and we've already
expended everything...

27:57.870 --> 27:58.904
How's Christine holding up?

27:58.937 --> 28:00.139
Not too good.

28:00.172 --> 28:02.841
I finally got her to lie
down, she's sleeping.

28:02.875 --> 28:04.510
- Did you get the phone?
- Yeah.

28:05.411 --> 28:06.512
I'm gonna go shower.

28:06.545 --> 28:07.379
Okay.

28:39.978 --> 28:42.749
I appreciate you
doing this, Jack,

28:42.782 --> 28:44.350
but you know you don't have to.

28:45.517 --> 28:47.319
I think I do, he
would do it for me.

28:48.887 --> 28:50.989
Love you, it's gonna be okay.

29:00.999 --> 29:02.868
Don't take any
risks out there.

29:02.901 --> 29:04.136
- I won't.
- Okay.

29:04.169 --> 29:05.270
Be careful driving back home.

29:05.304 --> 29:06.105
I will.

29:07.373 --> 29:09.541
- I love you.
- I love you.

31:16.769 --> 31:18.036
Aaron!

34:28.226 --> 34:29.728
That's far enough.

34:31.396 --> 34:33.264
Identify yourself.

34:33.297 --> 34:35.168
I trap these woods.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.201
I'm unarmed.

34:37.369 --> 34:39.603
What are you doing
out here at night?

34:39.639 --> 34:41.007
Checking my traps.

34:41.040 --> 34:44.208
I smelled the smoke,
thought I'd see who it was.

34:44.242 --> 34:46.179
I thought you might
have been my cousin.

34:48.580 --> 34:49.414
Jack Rollins.

34:51.216 --> 34:52.284
Don Bighorse.

34:53.186 --> 34:55.520
Why don't you come over
by the fire and visit a bit?

34:56.455 --> 34:57.355
Mind the tripwire.

35:02.594 --> 35:05.464
Go ahead and take a seat,
warm yourself by the fire.

35:05.497 --> 35:06.498
Thank you.

35:13.940 --> 35:15.507
I haven't seen you here before.

35:16.642 --> 35:18.443
I'm from East Texas.

35:18.477 --> 35:20.345
Oh, just out camping?

35:22.915 --> 35:24.516
I wish I was.

35:24.549 --> 35:27.220
My brother went missing
a few days back.

35:27.252 --> 35:28.688
I saw that on the news,

35:28.721 --> 35:30.489
but they said it
was a bear attack.

35:31.456 --> 35:32.959
Yeah, that's what they said.

35:34.127 --> 35:36.796
It probably was a bear,
but where's the body?

35:36.829 --> 35:38.097
We didn't find anything.

35:39.232 --> 35:41.399
I think we would've
found something.

35:41.433 --> 35:43.903
I know this may sound crazy,
but my brother called his wife

35:43.936 --> 35:45.738
the night before
he went missing.

35:45.772 --> 35:46.973
He was afraid.

35:48.674 --> 35:50.009
Real afraid.

35:50.042 --> 35:52.111
It's like he said
something was following him

35:52.145 --> 35:54.479
or stalking him
out in these woods.

35:54.513 --> 35:56.916
I don't know.

35:56.949 --> 35:58.517
Not crazy at all.

36:00.318 --> 36:02.454
I don't mean to
sound discouraging,

36:03.421 --> 36:04.724
but I believe in honesty.

36:05.892 --> 36:08.293
You're not going to
find your brother.

36:08.326 --> 36:09.427
Alive, anyway.

36:10.797 --> 36:12.430
The protector of these woods

36:13.365 --> 36:16.969
is angry and out for blood,

36:17.003 --> 36:19.806
and I think your brother
was in the wrong place

36:19.839 --> 36:21.007
at the wrong time.

36:23.508 --> 36:25.111
Protector of the woods?

36:25.144 --> 36:26.045
I don't follow.

36:27.479 --> 36:30.983
He has many names,
but you probably it best

36:31.017 --> 36:33.653
by the term Bigfoot.

36:35.554 --> 36:36.889
You believe in Bigfoot?

36:38.124 --> 36:40.325
Not a matter of belief for me.

36:40.358 --> 36:44.362
They live all over
in certain areas.

36:44.396 --> 36:45.865
Also live in these woods.

36:47.300 --> 36:50.870
I grew up in these woods,
and I've seen it twice now.

36:51.871 --> 36:54.339
Once as a teenager,

36:54.372 --> 36:57.475
and once only a week ago.

36:59.377 --> 37:02.614
I'm not saying I don't believe
you, Don, I don't know you,

37:02.648 --> 37:04.750
but it's hard for me to chalk
up my brother's disappearance

37:04.784 --> 37:06.118
to some legendary creature.

37:07.586 --> 37:11.023
I understand, and I am
not here to convince you.

37:12.158 --> 37:14.227
But I will tell you what
I know, Mr. Rollins.

37:15.294 --> 37:17.697
Whether you listen is up to you.

37:20.900 --> 37:25.671
Last week I was fishing
a river not far from here

37:26.605 --> 37:27.807
when I heard a gunshot.

37:34.546 --> 37:39.185
Not long after, I saw
a wounded sasquatch

37:39.218 --> 37:41.020
crawl out and die on the bank.

37:43.356 --> 37:47.459
Not even a minute passed before
a second bigfoot came out.

37:51.631 --> 37:52.464
It mourned.

37:54.599 --> 37:55.735
Then it became angry.

38:14.820 --> 38:16.421
It roared with vengeance.

38:17.622 --> 38:21.928
And I truly believe it
is on the warpath now.

38:21.961 --> 38:25.597
If I were you, I would move on.

38:25.631 --> 38:28.433
I would pack up and
go back to your family

38:28.466 --> 38:29.601
while you still can.

38:30.770 --> 38:34.572
Lest you suffer the same
fate as your brother.

38:34.606 --> 38:36.709
But my brother
wasn't here then.

38:36.742 --> 38:39.145
So even if these
things do exist,

38:39.178 --> 38:40.680
it wasn't him that shot it.

38:40.713 --> 38:42.248
It doesn't matter who shot it.

38:42.281 --> 38:45.318
Like I said, your brother
was in the wrong place

38:45.351 --> 38:46.618
at the wrong time.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.455
What about you being
out here at night alone?

38:50.488 --> 38:51.390
Aren't you afraid?

38:53.426 --> 38:57.997
I am afraid of them, but
they know I pose no threat.

38:58.030 --> 39:01.033
I carry no firearm,
only my knife.

39:02.435 --> 39:06.138
But you, you are a new face
with a gun on his turf.

39:07.907 --> 39:10.076
They are very smart.

39:11.410 --> 39:14.447
It knows who comes in
here with a weapon,

39:14.479 --> 39:17.383
the same kind of weapon
that took the life

39:17.416 --> 39:18.718
of one of its own.

39:21.253 --> 39:22.655
You are out of your element.

39:25.458 --> 39:27.259
We visit the woods together,

39:28.127 --> 39:30.562
but he is the master woodsman.

39:30.595 --> 39:32.732
A master of camouflage
and surveillance.

39:34.734 --> 39:37.303
He could be standing
right by you

39:37.336 --> 39:41.140
and you would never know it
unless it wanted you to know.

39:43.109 --> 39:45.411
Yeah, I think I seen that
post on social media too.

39:45.444 --> 39:48.247
What was it, hide and seek
champion of the world, right?

39:49.115 --> 39:51.083
Funny.

39:51.117 --> 39:51.951
I saw that too.

39:53.319 --> 39:57.622
But there's some
truth in every joke.

40:00.993 --> 40:05.530
Well, I have to get going.

40:05.563 --> 40:09.769
If you insist on staying, may
the great spirit protect you.

40:11.771 --> 40:13.205
Believe I have that covered.

40:15.540 --> 40:17.243
Well, it was nice
to meet you, Don.

40:17.276 --> 40:18.110
Likewise.

40:19.211 --> 40:21.313
And I'm sorry
about your brother.

40:21.347 --> 40:22.580
Thank you.

40:22.614 --> 40:23.849
Be safe.

40:23.883 --> 40:25.051
Same to you.

40:41.599 --> 40:43.169
Sorry, I forgot.

40:44.637 --> 40:46.472
No worries,
are you okay?

40:46.505 --> 40:48.441
Yeah, goodbye.

40:48.474 --> 40:50.109
Have a good night.

44:16.515 --> 44:17.449
Where's the bell?

44:19.952 --> 44:22.154
Ah, somebody's just
messing with you.

44:22.187 --> 44:24.523
No such thing as Bigfoot.

44:26.058 --> 44:27.226
No such thing.

45:21.513 --> 45:22.981
Aaron!

48:02.775 --> 48:04.711
Nobody's gonna
believe you, Jack.

48:06.478 --> 48:07.914
You can't tell
nobody about this.

48:12.852 --> 48:17.757
Just make it through the night,
out of here in the morning.

48:31.136 --> 48:33.171
Ah, just being paranoid, Jack.

48:35.274 --> 48:36.943
Just being paranoid.

48:43.181 --> 48:46.285
This isn't happening,
this isn't happening.

48:46.318 --> 48:48.487
It's messing with you now.

48:53.625 --> 48:54.626
Come on out!

49:12.912 --> 49:14.079
Show yourself!

49:22.889 --> 49:23.723
Screw it.

54:47.013 --> 54:47.847
My gun.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.216
Come on!

01:01:38.157 --> 01:01:38.991
Come on.

01:01:42.461 --> 01:01:43.295
Come on!

01:01:48.867 --> 01:01:49.736
Come get me!

01:01:55.074 --> 01:01:55.874
Come on!

01:04:19.551 --> 01:04:21.019
Get back in your, hey!

01:04:30.462 --> 01:04:32.431
Shots fired, officer
down at the corner

01:04:32.464 --> 01:04:35.300
of Anderson and
Polk, send backup.

01:05:22.682 --> 01:05:24.116
EMS to the scene.

01:08:17.657 --> 01:08:19.826
Hey, buddy, are you all right?

01:08:22.895 --> 01:08:24.162
I don't know.

01:08:24.197 --> 01:08:26.198
What are you doing out here?

01:08:26.231 --> 01:08:27.532
I'm really not sure.

01:08:27.566 --> 01:08:29.202
I don't even know
how I got here.

01:08:29.234 --> 01:08:32.104
Hey, well, by golly,
you don't look too good,

01:08:32.138 --> 01:08:34.173
so maybe you better get
in and I'll take you in

01:08:34.207 --> 01:08:36.408
to the hospital or something.

01:08:36.441 --> 01:08:38.443
Yeah, if you don't
mind, I'd appreciate it.

01:08:38.477 --> 01:08:39.511
No, not at all.

01:08:39.544 --> 01:08:41.214
Hey, I'm just here to help you.

01:17:44.089 --> 01:17:45.324
Mr. Rollins?

01:17:47.993 --> 01:17:49.161
How are you, sir?

01:17:50.362 --> 01:17:51.263
Okay, I guess.

01:17:51.297 --> 01:17:52.699
Do you know where you are?

01:17:53.899 --> 01:17:55.100
Hospital?

01:17:55.134 --> 01:17:56.502
That's right, you
are in a hospital.

01:17:56.535 --> 01:17:58.137
Do you know what day it is, sir?

01:18:00.707 --> 01:18:01.507
No.

01:18:02.709 --> 01:18:04.443
I'm gonna go ahead
and check your eyes.

01:18:05.277 --> 01:18:06.111
Okay.

01:18:15.854 --> 01:18:17.089
Aaron.

01:18:17.122 --> 01:18:17.956
Christine.

01:18:19.391 --> 01:18:20.694
We thought you were dead.

01:18:21.728 --> 01:18:23.128
What happened out there?

01:18:24.496 --> 01:18:25.732
I really don't know.

01:18:25.765 --> 01:18:28.033
Everything seems so foggy.

01:18:30.536 --> 01:18:32.672
Aaron has sustained
a head injury.

01:18:32.706 --> 01:18:34.306
He has temporary amnesia.

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:37.476
The majority of his memory
will return, but not all of it.

01:18:37.509 --> 01:18:39.011
How long do you
think he'll be here?

01:18:39.044 --> 01:18:40.913
I'd like to keep
him here another day

01:18:40.946 --> 01:18:42.716
just to monitor him, to be sure.

01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:46.051
If you need anything,
let me know,

01:18:46.085 --> 01:18:48.053
and I will be checking in.

01:18:48.087 --> 01:18:49.088
Thank you, Doctor.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.829
Hey, Rachel.

01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:56.696
Hey.

01:18:59.031 --> 01:19:00.933
Where's Jack?

01:19:00.966 --> 01:19:03.302
He's still out
there looking for you.

01:19:03.335 --> 01:19:04.903
Looking for me?

01:19:04.937 --> 01:19:06.572
Yeah.

01:19:06.605 --> 01:19:08.374
Yeah, we can't seem
to get ahold of him,

01:19:08.407 --> 01:19:10.409
but they're gonna find him.

01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:13.312
How long's he been out there?

01:19:13.345 --> 01:19:14.980
He's been out
there three days.

01:19:16.115 --> 01:19:18.183
But he just wouldn't
give up on you.

01:19:18.217 --> 01:19:20.986
When everybody else
did, he couldn't.

01:19:23.122 --> 01:19:25.357
- That's my brother.
- Yeah.

01:22:29.976 --> 01:22:31.310
I'm over here!

01:22:32.578 --> 01:22:33.746
I'm over here!

01:22:36.515 --> 01:22:37.349
Okay.

01:22:43.823 --> 01:22:44.657
Jack!

01:22:47.694 --> 01:22:50.362
- Sir, I'm glad to see you.
- Oh, I'm glad to see you too.

01:22:50.395 --> 01:22:52.130
We've been looking for you.

01:22:52.164 --> 01:22:54.266
Oh man, we'd better get
you to the hospital.

01:23:04.476 --> 01:23:06.278
All right, just take it easy.

01:23:06.311 --> 01:23:09.548
Just put your weight on
me, you'll be all right.

01:23:09.581 --> 01:23:11.450
Just ease you into
the backseat here.

01:23:16.622 --> 01:23:18.323
All right, here we go.

01:23:18.357 --> 01:23:19.726
What the heck is that thing?

01:23:19.759 --> 01:23:20.893
What is that?

01:23:23.395 --> 01:23:24.831
What do you do...

01:23:24.864 --> 01:23:27.667
It's okay, it saved me.

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:29.267
It saved me, come on.

01:23:29.301 --> 01:23:31.804
Get to the hospital.

01:23:31.838 --> 01:23:34.406
It's all right, it's all right.

01:23:48.453 --> 01:23:50.389
Was that a sasquatch?

01:23:50.422 --> 01:23:52.290
Must have been!

01:23:52.324 --> 01:23:54.861
That thing was huge,
nobody's gonna believe this!

01:24:00.332 --> 01:24:02.267
Hey, I've got some
good news for you.

01:24:02.300 --> 01:24:03.368
Your brother's alive.

01:24:04.469 --> 01:24:05.303
Come again?

01:24:06.673 --> 01:24:09.008
Yeah, we found him off
Highway 15 this morning.

01:24:09.042 --> 01:24:10.910
He's in the hospital
in Hot Springs.

01:24:10.943 --> 01:24:13.545
Your family sent me
out here to find you.

01:24:13.578 --> 01:24:14.981
Oh, that's real good news.

01:24:15.848 --> 01:24:16.949
That's real good news.

01:24:44.744 --> 01:24:47.479
Hey, baby, welcome back.

01:24:47.512 --> 01:24:48.346
Hey.

01:24:49.581 --> 01:24:51.550
Like you had a
rough one out there.

01:24:52.785 --> 01:24:54.087
Oh, you're telling me.

01:24:55.253 --> 01:24:56.421
I gotta tell you
about it sometime,

01:24:56.455 --> 01:24:57.890
but you may think I'm crazy.

01:24:57.924 --> 01:25:01.194
I already know you're
crazy, but it's okay.

01:25:03.863 --> 01:25:05.064
How's Aaron?

01:25:05.098 --> 01:25:06.132
He's doing good.

01:25:07.100 --> 01:25:08.366
Good.

01:25:10.870 --> 01:25:11.704
Hi.

01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:15.540
Speak of the devil.

01:25:17.076 --> 01:25:19.112
And he appears.

01:25:19.145 --> 01:25:20.847
He kept asking if
you were out of surgery

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:22.715
like every five minutes.

01:25:22.749 --> 01:25:23.983
He had to see you.

01:25:25.151 --> 01:25:27.619
Heard you come looking
for me out there.

01:25:27.653 --> 01:25:28.553
That I did.

01:25:30.455 --> 01:25:32.792
Looks like you had it
a little worse than me.

01:25:34.593 --> 01:25:36.929
Boy, have I got a
story to tell you guys.

01:25:37.864 --> 01:25:39.397
When I'm up to it, though.

01:25:40.565 --> 01:25:41.968
Yeah, my memory's
starting to come back,

01:25:42.001 --> 01:25:44.369
there's a few things I
wanna talk to you about too.

01:25:45.570 --> 01:25:46.505
That sounds good.

01:25:47.606 --> 01:25:49.642
Promise me one thing,
though, brother.

01:25:49.675 --> 01:25:53.445
Next time you go missing, you
go missing someplace tropical.

01:25:55.014 --> 01:25:56.716
I think I'd enjoy looking
for you a lot more there.

01:25:56.749 --> 01:25:57.917
I'll bet you would.

01:25:59.986 --> 01:26:03.256
Seriously, thanks for coming
to look for me, brother.

01:26:04.589 --> 01:26:06.391
Hey, that's what
brothers are for, right?

01:26:06.424 --> 01:26:07.260
Right on.

01:26:08.426 --> 01:26:11.798
Even if you couldn't
find me out there.

01:26:13.065 --> 01:26:14.634
- Get out of here.
- You two are always

01:26:14.667 --> 01:26:16.035
joking around.

01:26:17.369 --> 01:26:18.204
Always.

01:26:21.741 --> 01:26:25.011
For the longest time
I didn't pray to God.

01:26:27.546 --> 01:26:29.548
And I know a lot of you
don't believe in God,

01:26:29.581 --> 01:26:31.616
and that's okay.

01:26:31.651 --> 01:26:33.853
But for me, that's a big part

01:26:33.886 --> 01:26:35.721
of my life before the accident.

01:26:39.424 --> 01:26:41.794
And it's not like I blamed
God or was mad at him

01:26:41.828 --> 01:26:42.929
or anything like that.

01:26:45.932 --> 01:26:49.735
I just withdrew,
became this recluse.

01:26:53.139 --> 01:26:54.674
Man, this is hard.

01:26:56.575 --> 01:26:58.911
Take your time, Jack,
just take your time.

01:26:58.945 --> 01:27:01.047
It's gonna be okay,
we'll get through this.

01:27:03.415 --> 01:27:04.917
I guess what I'm
trying to say is,

01:27:04.951 --> 01:27:06.618
and I'm not trying
to preach here, okay?

01:27:06.652 --> 01:27:08.721
I'm not trying to
become this preacher.

01:27:10.923 --> 01:27:15.627
But the Bible says our life
on this earth is like a vapor.

01:27:15.661 --> 01:27:17.629
It's here one minute
and gone the next.

01:27:18.798 --> 01:27:21.466
And this baby boy is
with him in eternity.

01:27:22.802 --> 01:27:24.103
With him now, and nobody,

01:27:24.136 --> 01:27:26.138
nothing can pluck
him out of his hand.

01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:29.909
He'll never have
to suffer again,

01:27:29.942 --> 01:27:32.444
and I know that one day
I'll see that boy again.

01:27:34.579 --> 01:27:35.648
I'll see him again.

01:27:37.515 --> 01:27:38.751
And I'm ready.

01:27:40.485 --> 01:27:42.321
I'm ready to be a cop again.

01:27:42.355 --> 01:27:47.159
I'm ready to put this behind
me, move on with my life.

01:27:49.295 --> 01:27:51.130
I just think it
took someone special

01:27:52.298 --> 01:27:54.499
to show me that life
is still worth living.

01:27:56.468 --> 01:27:58.738
Thank you all for your support.

01:27:58.771 --> 01:28:00.940
- You're brave.
- Appreciate it.

01:28:00.973 --> 01:28:03.776
Jack, man, that's amazing.

01:28:03.809 --> 01:28:05.645
I know I speak for all
of us when I tell you

01:28:05.678 --> 01:28:08.748
how much we love you and how
proud of you that we are.

01:29:06.272 --> 01:29:07.106
Keep it.
