WEBVTT

00:01.552 --> 00:02.865
What is he doing here?

00:02.889 --> 00:04.194
- Who?
- Beck!

00:04.218 --> 00:06.661
You only came here because
Liam asked you to.

00:06.685 --> 00:08.115
I came 'cause I always want to see you.

00:08.638 --> 00:10.437
You've caught me on a
good day, bodyguard.

00:10.736 --> 00:14.139
Are you familiar with the expression
"at Her Majesty's pleasure"?

00:14.655 --> 00:17.198
You realize I have trust issues? Yes?

00:17.645 --> 00:19.166
I found that in the Queen's bed.

00:19.190 --> 00:21.882
- Armed police!
- Nobody move!

00:22.211 --> 00:24.258
'I took a solemn oath to serve you all.

00:24.282 --> 00:29.028
I do so today by formally calling for
the abolishment of the monarchy.'

00:29.038 --> 00:31.539
- There's no way out of this.
- There's always a way.

00:32.740 --> 00:34.940
Open the gate! The King is down!

00:35.576 --> 00:37.810
- He'd been attacked.
- Who could have done this?

00:37.879 --> 00:39.412
I need you to be my alibi.

00:40.314 --> 00:42.715
You are the acting King of England.

00:42.784 --> 00:45.084
All this I promise to do.

00:45.119 --> 00:46.919
So help me God.

00:46.988 --> 00:48.854
These children are illegitimate.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.339
Tell us it isn't true.

00:51.292 --> 00:53.793
- The next King of England.
- Long live the Queen.

00:54.762 --> 00:56.896
You're going on a little trip.

00:56.964 --> 01:00.900
I did what you asked. I declared the
Prince and Princess illegitimate.

01:00.968 --> 01:03.636
I'm going to ask Parliament
to place the Queen in power.

01:03.704 --> 01:05.137
You'll be England's final monarch.

01:06.841 --> 01:09.108
When you found me in that
alley, what time was it?

01:09.177 --> 01:11.911
I didn't find you in an alley.
I found you in the park.

01:14.949 --> 01:18.400
Sir, please remove your hands
from Great Britain's King.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:55.590 --> 01:57.056
(Cheering)

02:18.980 --> 02:22.114
Still wearing black, I see.
Well played.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.716
Very clever of you

02:23.801 --> 02:26.318
to keep up the appearance of mourning.

02:26.387 --> 02:29.205
Have you considered the fact
I may actually be mourning?

02:29.290 --> 02:31.857
As if! It's been two months.

02:31.926 --> 02:33.759
Took me about two weeks.

02:36.914 --> 02:39.381
Mr. Moorefield would like an audience.

02:39.467 --> 02:40.799
Tell him we'll speak soon.

02:40.868 --> 02:43.052
For the moment, things are... fluid.

02:49.443 --> 02:51.710
(Groans)

02:51.746 --> 02:54.480
Has Piggy been good?

02:55.616 --> 02:57.383
Or bad?

02:57.435 --> 02:58.851
Bad.

02:58.903 --> 03:00.536
Very bad.

03:02.123 --> 03:05.241
Well, then, you'll have to
be punished, won't you?

03:08.429 --> 03:10.162
(Groans)

03:10.197 --> 03:11.797
(Panting)

03:18.172 --> 03:20.439
Hello, Prime Minister.

03:23.644 --> 03:26.078
We need to talk.

03:26.163 --> 03:27.713
(Groans)

03:33.120 --> 03:34.820
(Cheering and applause)

03:40.127 --> 03:42.127
For His Majesty's approval.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.090
(Cheering)

03:58.162 --> 04:00.779
(Shouting and laughter)

04:05.219 --> 04:06.352
Pig.

04:07.521 --> 04:10.356
Smile, Princess. I believe
it's part of our arrangement.

04:11.826 --> 04:16.394
You know, the last King didn't
actually have to buy their affection.

04:26.223 --> 04:27.940
(Honking)

04:40.338 --> 04:43.522
- Do I even want to know?
- It's a swan.

04:43.591 --> 04:45.290
Only the King is allowed to eat them.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.826
But why in God's name would
you want to eat a poor swan?

04:47.862 --> 04:50.162
Because I can.

04:51.198 --> 04:53.248
Have you seen this?

04:53.334 --> 04:57.002
'Princess, your public celebrity
seems to be at an all-time high.

04:57.071 --> 04:59.038
Are you going to the
Queen's garden party?

04:59.106 --> 05:02.191
Who in their right mind would
want to go to a thing like that?

05:02.276 --> 05:05.377
- So, you're not going?
- Absolutely not.

05:05.446 --> 05:07.963
How about I throw my own party
and you're all invited?

05:08.049 --> 05:10.416
It'll be like the after-party,
only at the same time.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.851
- What do you think?
- (Cheering)

05:12.920 --> 05:15.921
(REPORTER) Once again, it seems
celebrity trumps monarchy,

05:15.990 --> 05:18.457
as Princess Eleanor steals the show.'

05:18.526 --> 05:22.261
The garden party's a disaster.
We'll have to cancel.

05:22.296 --> 05:25.564
She needs to be controlled.
They both do.

05:25.616 --> 05:28.434
You're the one that stripped them of
their titles and chased them out.

05:28.519 --> 05:30.502
People find them sympathetic.

05:30.588 --> 05:33.072
Emphasis on "pathetic".

05:33.140 --> 05:35.674
They are more popular than ever.

05:35.743 --> 05:38.927
So, maybe we use their popularity.

05:39.013 --> 05:40.646
Reinstate their titles.

05:40.715 --> 05:44.466
Make it look like they work
for us, not against us.

05:44.552 --> 05:47.586
- And if they refuse?
- Let's find out.

05:47.655 --> 05:49.221
(Gong resounding)

05:53.244 --> 05:55.811
Pussycat, pussycat,
where have you been?

05:55.896 --> 05:59.465
As a favor to the Queen
Consort, I've decided

05:59.550 --> 06:03.819
to reinstate your titles and all
the spoiled trappings forthwith.

06:03.904 --> 06:07.573
All I ask for is a modicum
of respect and decorum.

06:07.658 --> 06:09.908
- Respect?
- And an apology.

06:09.994 --> 06:12.077
Go to hell. Let's go, Len.

06:13.247 --> 06:14.463
We're sorry.

06:16.467 --> 06:18.300
I'm not sure I heard that.

06:19.887 --> 06:21.920
I said that we're sorry.

06:23.841 --> 06:25.924
And the ring?

06:26.644 --> 06:28.093
Len...

06:49.784 --> 06:51.784
Welcome home.

06:53.454 --> 06:55.204
See you at the polo match.

07:00.511 --> 07:02.177
Hey, what was that?

07:02.263 --> 07:04.930
If you can't say "sorry", you
could at least say "thank you".

07:04.965 --> 07:06.799
- For what?
- Getting us back in the game.

07:06.851 --> 07:09.184
You think I want to be here?
You think I want any of this?

07:09.270 --> 07:17.420
No, I don't, but if we want
answers, we need access.

07:17.455 --> 07:19.255
You want to find out who
killed Robert, yes? And Dad??

07:19.290 --> 07:23.292
Of course I do. But it doesn't matter,
because they have it all wrong.

07:23.344 --> 07:25.845
They don't get rid of us, Liam.

07:25.930 --> 07:27.513
We get rid of them.

07:48.286 --> 07:51.587
Ah, Mr. Moody. Still living
it up on the people's money?

07:51.639 --> 07:54.957
A software designer, isn't it?
Gemma Kensington's fiance?

07:54.993 --> 07:57.860
She created an app that removes
naked selfies from the cloud.

07:57.896 --> 07:59.996
I'll have to try it.

08:00.064 --> 08:03.199
But wasn't Gemma Kensington's
fiance meant to be young Liam,

08:03.268 --> 08:04.750
as promised by you?

08:04.836 --> 08:08.004
Let me give you some advice, before
you send those dick pics, Winston.

08:08.690 --> 08:10.740
Most women like a bit
of power and money.

08:10.792 --> 08:14.126
When Liam lost the crown, he lost the girl.
Shit happens.

08:14.212 --> 08:16.696
- Can I quote you on that?
- (Groans)

08:16.781 --> 08:18.848
I thought I smelled the press.

08:18.917 --> 08:22.301
Oh, come, now. I thought you were
attracted to my power and money.

08:22.387 --> 08:24.887
On some people it looks simply garish.

08:24.956 --> 08:28.524
Especially disreputable media
moguls like you, Mr. Crenshaw.

08:31.963 --> 08:34.931
- Shall we do the dance?
- Of course.

08:34.999 --> 08:39.659
The Prince and Princess
are back in the palace.

08:39.683 --> 08:41.236
True.

08:41.280 --> 08:46.147
Some would say it's a PR move,
to keep up appearances.

08:46.216 --> 08:49.117
Soe ery've known.

08:49.185 --> 08:50.718
I lost a husband and a son.

08:51.020 --> 08:54.188
This is a period of transition
and healing for us.

08:54.274 --> 08:57.592
Is that what Princess Eleanor has
been doing in the clubs? Healing?

08:57.677 --> 08:59.660
Look, why don't you say
what you have to say,

08:59.729 --> 09:02.296
I'll deny it, and then we can
all go back to the game?

09:02.382 --> 09:05.149
Believe it or not, Your
Majesty, I'm on your side.

09:05.235 --> 09:08.169
If my papers printed what
I'm told is the truth...

09:08.204 --> 09:09.670
And what is that?

09:09.722 --> 09:11.772
That your daughter is
again spending her nights

09:11.808 --> 09:14.192
rewriting the rules of decency,

09:14.277 --> 09:16.711
whilst your son is on
a one-man crusade,

09:16.779 --> 09:21.015
attempting to avenge the death
of our late, great King Simon.

09:21.050 --> 09:24.569
Our current King is arrogant and vain,

09:24.654 --> 09:29.123
and his Queen Consort is
attempting to usurp his daughters,

09:29.159 --> 09:31.626
who, as far as anyone can tell,

09:31.711 --> 09:34.729
are scarcely a step above
imbecilic half-wits.

09:35.315 --> 09:36.948
They're not a step above.

09:37.033 --> 09:39.700
Other than that, categorically untrue.

09:40.753 --> 09:44.305
What can you say about Prince
Liam going to Gibraltar?

09:45.375 --> 09:48.259
I'm sorry, son. I wish I
could tell you otherwise,

09:48.344 --> 09:51.229
but the results are medically
and factually accurate.

09:51.314 --> 09:53.197
There's no conspiracy here.

09:58.922 --> 10:00.888

10:25.915 --> 10:27.248
You pull off. It's my line.

10:27.283 --> 10:29.717
Fine. Then go ahead
and kill your sister.

10:35.091 --> 10:36.791
(Neighing)

10:41.197 --> 10:43.331
You realize there's a match going on?

10:43.383 --> 10:44.932
You realize you're stalking me?

10:45.001 --> 10:46.701
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

10:46.736 --> 10:49.170
I saw you in Paris. I saw you in Spain.

10:49.255 --> 10:50.938
Skulking about in the shadows.

10:51.007 --> 10:52.673
Stop following me.

10:52.742 --> 10:56.611
With all due respect, Princess, a
thank-you might be more appropriate.

10:56.646 --> 10:59.297
You're traveling without security.
You've been a shit show.

10:59.382 --> 11:01.382
How I've been or where I've been

11:01.434 --> 11:03.884
are the concerns of a
boyfriend or a bodyguard,

11:03.953 --> 11:06.003
neither of which you are any longer.

11:06.089 --> 11:08.642
So, you're saying I was
your boyfriend once?

11:08.667 --> 11:09.914
Stop stalking me.

11:11.744 --> 11:13.928
What's it gonna take
for you to forgive me?

11:15.915 --> 11:17.999
Nothing, Jasper.

11:18.601 --> 11:20.635
But a few words of advice,

11:20.687 --> 11:24.105
for whatever foolish girl
you decide to stalk next:

11:24.140 --> 11:26.641
Mother's vagina? Deal-breaker.

11:27.727 --> 11:29.477

No. No, he's not.

12:02.849 --> 12:05.299
Lucky for you, I am.

12:09.405 --> 12:11.639
(Moaning and whispering)

12:16.245 --> 12:20.748
(Dully) Yeah. Right there. Yeah.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.050
That's great.

12:23.086 --> 12:24.318
(Whispers)

12:36.799 --> 12:38.466
He saw you coming.

12:38.534 --> 12:40.167
The man in the striped jacket.

12:40.236 --> 12:42.870
He called you tenacious.

12:42.939 --> 12:45.523
Well, actually, he called
you a tenacious prick,

12:45.608 --> 12:47.975
but "tenacious" is good.

12:50.246 --> 12:52.413
He's hiding over there, by the way.

12:52.482 --> 12:54.348
Oh, my God! Is that fudge?

13:05.995 --> 13:07.695
Mr. Holloway.

13:10.566 --> 13:12.066
We have nothing to discuss.

13:12.135 --> 13:14.402
Then why have you been avoiding me?

13:15.505 --> 13:17.872
We have nothing to discuss.

13:27.684 --> 13:29.667
(Thudding and grunting)

13:36.826 --> 13:38.526
(Grunts)

13:42.565 --> 13:45.099
Mr. Holloway will speak with you now.

13:54.677 --> 13:56.343
Your Majesty.

13:56.412 --> 13:59.313
Mr. Moorefield. The man
who hates the Monarchy.

13:59.365 --> 14:01.649
Hate is a rather strong
word, Your Majesty.

14:01.718 --> 14:03.951
Don't be afraid to hate, Mr.
Moorefield.

14:04.003 --> 14:07.421
Nobody hates any more. They dislike.
They disdain.

14:07.507 --> 14:09.340
Eventually, they'll eradicate hate,

14:09.425 --> 14:11.726
and they'll wonder why
they can't recognize love.

14:11.778 --> 14:15.329
And is that why the Queen has summoned
me to the stables? To discuss love?

14:15.415 --> 14:17.364
That's precisely why.

14:17.433 --> 14:20.234
It seems you've fallen in love,
Mr. Moorefield.

14:20.286 --> 14:22.002
- Have I?
- You have.

14:22.088 --> 14:23.671
You're vexed. You're smitten.

14:23.756 --> 14:25.222
You're downright besotted.

14:25.308 --> 14:27.024
That's interesting.

14:27.110 --> 14:30.444
I'm afraid my heart has
neglected to inform me of this.

14:30.513 --> 14:33.147
Will the Queen be so kind as to
tell me the name of the girl

14:33.199 --> 14:35.950
who has so brazenly captured my desire?

14:36.018 --> 14:37.852
Not "girl", Mr. Moorefield.

14:38.588 --> 14:40.221
Girls.

14:49.699 --> 14:53.467
(Sighs) I can't believe we're not going
to the polo match because of you.

14:53.553 --> 14:56.587
There's probably gonna be
loads of cute boys there.

14:56.672 --> 14:58.956
Boys who just can't
help that their loins

14:59.041 --> 15:01.575
are in the presence of the
future Queen of England.

15:01.644 --> 15:03.677
(Bell ringing)

15:03.746 --> 15:06.947
You and your stupid bell. I don't know
why you had to get it all done at once.

15:06.983 --> 15:08.749
I told you to wait
till after the match,

15:08.818 --> 15:12.286
but you won't listen to me, even though
I'm the future Queen of England.

15:12.321 --> 15:16.190
What Princess wants, Princess gets.
Selfish cow.

15:22.899 --> 15:25.533
They're probably having so much fun.

15:25.835 --> 15:30.087
You realize my security detail
is lying in the corridor?

15:30.173 --> 15:32.490
He's in the cloak room now.
With the cloaks.

15:33.426 --> 15:36.944
- What do you want from me?
- You know exactly what I want.

15:37.480 --> 15:39.866
You weren't with Cyrus when
my father was stabbed.

15:39.891 --> 15:40.872
Of course I was.

15:40.917 --> 15:44.952
And the last I heard, our late
King Simon was not your father.

15:51.894 --> 15:54.578
Oh, God! Please! Are you mad?

15:54.664 --> 15:56.697
I'm not debating paternity
with you, Holloway.

15:56.766 --> 15:58.666
I'm simply asking you a question,

15:58.734 --> 16:01.402
and I expect you to tell me the truth.

16:01.470 --> 16:03.938
What, or you're gonna shoot me? (Gasps)

16:04.006 --> 16:05.055
Yeah.

16:05.141 --> 16:09.076
Okay! Okay. He wasn't with me.
I wasn't with him.

16:13.466 --> 16:16.784
But you... you need to
protect me on this.

16:17.987 --> 16:20.120
Cyrus promised me things.

16:20.189 --> 16:22.423
He said I would be Prime Minister.
He lied.

16:22.508 --> 16:24.325
Does that surprise you?

16:24.861 --> 16:26.427
Where was he that night?

16:26.462 --> 16:29.396
I don't know. He wasn't with me.

16:30.333 --> 16:34.235
Look... I need to go. Okay?

16:39.175 --> 16:41.342
Mr. Holloway...

16:41.377 --> 16:43.544
The claim ticket for your bodyguard.

16:48.267 --> 16:51.518
- Thanks. I appreciate it.
- Barrel down, please.

16:51.587 --> 16:52.970
Sorry.

16:58.628 --> 17:00.961
I haven't seen you for a while.
Not since...

17:01.013 --> 17:02.963
Since the day the King died.

17:03.599 --> 17:05.266
How's Ophelia?

17:05.351 --> 17:07.268
I don't know. She's in New York.

17:07.869 --> 17:10.788
- You don't talk?
- She doesn't talk.

17:10.873 --> 17:13.040
I reached out a few times,
but she didn't reply.

17:13.108 --> 17:15.376
Not that I blame her.
She was pretty upset.

17:16.712 --> 17:18.811
Maybe it's for the best.

17:19.147 --> 17:21.098
What was all that about
during the match?

17:21.183 --> 17:23.217
Between you and Eleanor.

17:23.286 --> 17:25.703
She's angry because I've
been keeping an eye on her.

17:25.788 --> 17:27.671
You've been stalking her?

17:28.340 --> 17:30.140
I prefer body-guardian angel.

17:30.226 --> 17:32.693
But she disagrees. You
know what she's like.

17:32.728 --> 17:34.561
Actually, I don't.

17:34.614 --> 17:36.997
She doesn't let me in much these days.

17:37.049 --> 17:38.632
So, how is she?

17:39.869 --> 17:41.518
She's a disaster.

17:47.727 --> 17:50.611
Your father would be endlessly
disappointed in you.

17:51.280 --> 17:53.647
Yes, well, why don't you
tell me who my father is,

17:53.699 --> 17:55.316
and then we'll see about that?

17:56.319 --> 17:58.652
Try not to let the horse fall on you.

18:14.761 --> 18:19.397
Yes, that's right. Daddy is
dead and I am now Queen.

18:20.700 --> 18:23.401
Yes, yes, my sister did
die from chlamydia.

18:23.469 --> 18:25.152
(Moorefield clears throat)

18:25.238 --> 18:27.905
Forgive me, Your Highness. I
didn't mean to startle you.

18:27.974 --> 18:30.741
No... no... I was just pretending.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.410
Well, these are for you.

18:32.445 --> 18:34.779
For me? Why?

18:34.847 --> 18:39.850
Well, if you must know, I've
thought about you a lot lately,

18:39.919 --> 18:41.686
as well as er...

18:41.754 --> 18:42.920
Fantasized?

18:45.058 --> 18:46.207
Oh...

18:48.645 --> 18:50.161
Would you care to join me?

18:54.534 --> 18:56.234
(Penelope clears throat)

18:57.587 --> 19:00.471
We should probably keep this a secret.

19:00.974 --> 19:03.441
I am an anti-monarchist, after all.

19:09.249 --> 19:12.049
Yes. Yes, of course.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.985
It's so forbidden.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.643
(Penelope chuckles)

19:33.806 --> 19:36.474
So he wasn't with Holloway?
It doesn't mean he did it.

19:36.542 --> 19:38.025
But it means he was lying.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.678
No-one had more to gain than he did.

19:40.747 --> 19:43.414
As far as I'm concerned,
he's back on the list.

19:43.483 --> 19:47.702
Along with the Queen, you, me
and everyone else in the world.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.887
Boone said the calls were
from inside the palace.

19:49.956 --> 19:53.090
Yes, but that was about Robert,
Liam, not necessarily about Dad.

19:53.159 --> 19:55.493
They're related, Lenny,
and we both know it.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.531
So is this.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.116
What is this?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.037
It was around my neck when
I passed out in the rain.

20:06.105 --> 20:07.838
- What?
- The night you met with Boone.

20:07.907 --> 20:10.174
What does it mean? What...?

20:10.243 --> 20:11.692
Why haven't you told me about this?

20:11.778 --> 20:14.278
I don't know. I'm sorry. I
thought I could figure it out.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.982
Sometimes I wish Marcus was still here.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.484
Yeah, well, you can't
blame him for wanting out

20:20.553 --> 20:22.853
- as soon as Cyrus became King.
- I don't blame him.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.922
I just miss him.

20:24.974 --> 20:27.391
I don't know who else I can trust.

20:27.427 --> 20:28.793
(Sighs)

20:29.629 --> 20:31.562
I saw Jasper today.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.099
Speaking of people who we cannot trust.

20:35.168 --> 20:37.389
I wouldn't have got to
Holloway without him.

20:37.414 --> 20:38.893
Jasper cannot be trusted!

20:41.841 --> 20:44.208

Your Majesty. Can I be of service?

21:57.583 --> 21:59.083
Yes.

21:59.168 --> 22:02.303
You can keep the Queen's
bastards under control.

22:02.388 --> 22:05.322
With all due respect, Prince
Liam and Princess Eleanor

22:05.358 --> 22:07.191
no longer fall under my purview.

22:07.276 --> 22:09.160
I'm reinstating their security.

22:09.228 --> 22:11.328
They're running amok like savages.

22:11.397 --> 22:13.397
We need to keep an eye on them.

22:13.466 --> 22:14.999
As you wish.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.804
Have you ever wondered why
I kept you on, Pryce?

22:19.872 --> 22:21.555
Because I'm good at what I do.

22:21.641 --> 22:23.190
As if!

22:24.110 --> 22:26.827
I kept you on because Liam trusts you

22:26.913 --> 22:28.712
and he doesn't trust me.

22:28.781 --> 22:31.215
Pull him in close, watch him intently.

22:31.868 --> 22:33.984
The ascension of the fallen King's son

22:34.036 --> 22:36.921
is so predictable it's boring.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.257
Enjoy the asbestos...

22:40.326 --> 22:41.959
Pryce.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.797
Is that what passes for
a King these days?

22:52.722 --> 22:55.573
- Prime Minister.
- Your Majesty.

22:55.641 --> 22:57.424
Working late, I see.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.511
- The opening of Parliament.
- Yes, I know.

23:00.596 --> 23:03.247
And once opened, the
first order of business

23:03.282 --> 23:05.933
will be our bill to change
the order of succession.

23:06.018 --> 23:08.702
If something should befall King Cyrus,

23:08.788 --> 23:11.555
the Queen Consort will become
the next acting monarch.

23:11.591 --> 23:15.125
- But the King's children...
- Will be declared unfit to rule.

23:15.161 --> 23:18.362
I trust the palace can
rely on your discretion

23:18.431 --> 23:20.598
just as you can rely on mine.

23:23.302 --> 23:25.302
It's important, wouldn't you say?

23:27.106 --> 23:29.507
Discretion.

23:30.243 --> 23:34.845
When I was a boy... I had a governess.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.448
We all have our desires,

Your daughter's in the States.
You're constantly working.

Don't.

26:32.678 --> 26:34.578
Has no-one ever said that to you?

26:34.647 --> 26:36.413
Well, that's a tragedy, isn't it?

26:37.016 --> 26:39.750
Some deranged lunatic tries
to assassinate The King,

26:39.819 --> 26:41.185
and you blame yourself?

26:41.253 --> 26:43.821
I am not having this
conversation again tonight.

(Buzzer)

26:50.596 --> 26:52.262
(Exhales)

26:54.600 --> 26:56.867
Mr. Pryce? Did I catch
you at a bad time?

26:56.936 --> 26:59.253
Nothing that won't still
be there once you've gone.

26:59.338 --> 27:01.188
Please. Come in.

27:01.273 --> 27:03.107
What have you heard from Ophelia?

27:03.192 --> 27:04.875
- Not much, actually.
- Good.

27:04.944 --> 27:06.660
Then I won't take it personally.

27:06.746 --> 27:10.247
Now, I understand that you've spent
some time with Mr. Holloway today.

27:10.316 --> 27:11.915
We may have crossed paths.

27:11.984 --> 27:14.251
And does "crossing
paths" include holding

27:14.320 --> 27:16.470
a loaded firearm to his head?

27:17.823 --> 27:19.690
Look, Liam, it bothers me immensely

27:19.759 --> 27:22.192
that I haven't uncovered
your father's assailant.

27:22.261 --> 27:24.528
- It's not your job.
- No. Neither is it yours.

27:24.597 --> 27:27.798
I'm reinstating your security detail,
which, all things considered,

27:27.867 --> 27:30.234
it's no bad thing as
far as I'm concerned.

27:30.302 --> 27:33.971
Beyond that, though...
if you want to talk...

27:34.940 --> 27:38.475

27:43.916 --> 27:45.916
I'd like Jasper Frost
for my security detail.

27:45.985 --> 27:46.777
He is no longer...

27:46.802 --> 27:49.177
I know. He'd like to come
back and I'd like him to.

27:49.221 --> 27:51.839
- Liam...
- Do this for me and I'll back off and...

27:51.924 --> 27:54.258
you know, stay in line.

27:57.263 --> 27:59.329

31:13.693 --> 31:16.527
Attila The Hun drowned in his
own blood on his wedding night.

31:16.596 --> 31:20.331
At least he didn't have to ask permission
of Parliament to go to the lavatory.

31:23.003 --> 31:25.103
Duchy...

31:25.171 --> 31:29.207
I believe our wager
was for £40, not 20.

31:29.276 --> 31:32.577
40? Oh, was it?

31:32.646 --> 31:34.445
Yes, it was.

31:34.514 --> 31:38.866
Well, I do respect a king
who demands accountability.

31:39.786 --> 31:42.987
It's about time someone showed
some balls around here.

32:01.308 --> 32:03.141
I need to ask you about Lenny.

32:03.209 --> 32:04.776
What happened between the two of you?

32:04.861 --> 32:06.344
Before or after The King died?

32:06.413 --> 32:08.079
Both, I guess.

32:08.148 --> 32:10.331
Well, before, we had a relationship.

32:11.518 --> 32:13.468
Sort of. You know what she's like.

32:14.554 --> 32:16.254
And then she had me arrested.

32:16.323 --> 32:18.923
- Why?
- Because I slept with your mum.

32:20.994 --> 32:23.227
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Go ahead.

32:23.296 --> 32:25.013
- She has trust issues.
- I know that.

32:25.098 --> 32:26.764
Son of a bitch!

32:27.701 --> 32:31.936
And after? And I sincerely hope this
sad, broken tale doesn't get worse.

32:32.005 --> 32:35.006
And after I... followed
her around the world.

32:35.075 --> 32:38.009
- Because?
- Because there's a killer on the loose.

32:39.713 --> 32:41.713
Because I have feelings for her.

32:41.781 --> 32:43.731
- Because I know I screwed up.
- You think?

32:43.817 --> 32:45.316
Someone needed to look after her.

32:45.385 --> 32:47.986
- I saw the press.
- You don't know the half of it.

32:49.122 --> 32:52.423
After that party that you
read about in Paris,

32:52.492 --> 32:54.926
she just wandered around the city.

32:54.995 --> 32:56.694
For hours.

32:56.780 --> 32:58.863
And in Brazil...

32:58.915 --> 33:02.900
she charmed everyone and then just
spent days crying in private.

33:03.870 --> 33:07.105
I choked out more male models
and drug dealers than Cyrus.

33:11.277 --> 33:14.412
I asked Ted to reinstate
you as my security detail.

33:14.481 --> 33:15.880
I need your help.

33:15.949 --> 33:18.449
But I need to know
that I can trust you.

33:20.186 --> 33:21.552
You can.

33:21.621 --> 33:25.723
As far as Eleanor goes...
the rest is yours to fix.

33:25.759 --> 33:27.759
We've all got shit we've
got to deal with.

33:33.149 --> 33:34.932
This was hanging around my neck

33:34.984 --> 33:36.651
the night before The King was killed.

33:38.321 --> 33:40.104
What does it mean?

33:40.156 --> 33:41.739
I want you to find out.

33:41.775 --> 33:43.408
But if I had to guess?

33:43.860 --> 33:47.278
If we figure this out, we figure
out who's been killing my family.

33:48.665 --> 33:50.782
And then we make them pay.

34:10.730 --> 34:13.097
Take it away. What's for dessert?

34:14.166 --> 34:16.603
I believe we have a bun in the oven.

34:16.743 --> 34:18.458
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.

34:18.543 --> 34:21.545
- How did you get in here?
- Unlike you, I have friends in the palace.

34:21.614 --> 34:25.349
For now. Well, your body
certainly looks a fright.

34:26.219 --> 34:30.688
But your mouth looks
as succulent as ever.

34:33.493 --> 34:36.393
- You're disgusting.
- It's £40.

34:36.462 --> 34:39.897
- Think of your child.
- I believe you mean "our" child.

34:39.966 --> 34:42.667
Throw a stick. There might even be

34:42.735 --> 34:45.619
a Pregnant Wenches of Cyrus
Support Group you can join.

34:45.705 --> 34:49.540
Yes. But that group
was for Prince Cyrus.

34:50.643 --> 34:54.311
I'm more concerned about King Cyrus.

34:54.364 --> 34:58.382
You know, the one who can't seem
to get the people to like him.

34:58.451 --> 35:02.787
I press my panic button and your
bastard kid will be born in prison.

35:02.855 --> 35:04.121
No.

35:05.158 --> 35:07.858
Our son will be born in the palace.

35:07.944 --> 35:10.094
He'll be the rightful
heir to the throne

35:10.146 --> 35:13.864
and your legacy will continue
long after you're gone.

35:13.933 --> 35:15.700
My daughters will see to that.

35:15.768 --> 35:18.135
(Scoffs) Really?

35:19.038 --> 35:21.205
Your daughters will be a laughing stock

35:21.240 --> 35:22.923
and as a result, so will you.

35:23.009 --> 35:24.842
For the rest of time.

35:27.613 --> 35:30.748
I'm offering you a
chance to change that.

35:34.220 --> 35:38.189
You fall in love... you have a son...

35:38.257 --> 35:40.858
and the world will see you differently.

35:40.927 --> 35:43.594
Are you finished? Good.

35:43.663 --> 35:45.696
Now, it's my turn.

35:46.632 --> 35:48.833
I don't care what the
people think of me.

35:48.901 --> 35:51.368
And I don't care if
you go to the press.

35:51.437 --> 35:54.572
I have a bit of experience
with paternity claims.

35:54.657 --> 35:58.142
So you take that money, because
it's all you'll ever get,

35:58.194 --> 36:02.113
and waddle your insipid,
low-born, barely palatable poon

36:02.181 --> 36:06.283
back to the disease-infested
shithole you crawled out of.

36:07.186 --> 36:09.420
Bluff called.

36:09.455 --> 36:11.455
Big moment dashed.

36:13.059 --> 36:17.928
I've got 99 problems...
and a bitch ain't one.

36:28.341 --> 36:30.341
We'll see about that.

36:42.321 --> 36:44.421
Hey.

36:45.641 --> 36:47.591
You go out tonight?

36:48.661 --> 36:51.228
Yeah. Nothing special.

36:51.664 --> 36:52.897
You?

36:52.965 --> 36:54.865
No. I haven't been out since...

37:04.777 --> 37:07.745
I just have to set it
down sometimes, you know?

37:09.582 --> 37:11.749
Dad's death. And Robert.

37:14.086 --> 37:16.554
- So do you.
- I can't, Len.

37:18.524 --> 37:20.724
If I do, I'll be failing Dad again.
I...

37:22.128 --> 37:24.161
..can't do that.

37:25.464 --> 37:26.647
Liam.

37:28.701 --> 37:31.035
I love you.

37:31.070 --> 37:32.236
You know that?

37:33.606 --> 37:35.039
What's that for?

37:36.375 --> 37:38.609
I just never said it to Dad.

37:39.779 --> 37:41.478
He knew.

37:43.282 --> 37:44.915
Yeah.

37:53.492 --> 37:59.330
"The rich man in his castle,
the poor man at his gate."

38:01.000 --> 38:03.017
Don't mock me.

38:06.622 --> 38:09.707
I'm dead now, honey. I
can do what I want.
