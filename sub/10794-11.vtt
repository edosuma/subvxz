WEBVTT

00:03.104 --> 00:05.406
RUSH: I may be
 on the verge of discovering

00:05.439 --> 00:09.143
the true nature
 of Destiny's mission.

00:09.177 --> 00:12.046
ELI: You've had
 control of this ship
 the whole time!

00:12.080 --> 00:13.747
Why wouldn't
 you tell anyone?

00:13.781 --> 00:17.251
The Lucian Alliance
 is planning an attack
 on Earth.

00:17.285 --> 00:20.088
YOUNG: I killed Riley.
 I suffocated him
 with my own hands.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.723
You are
 a good commander.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.659
YOUNG: There is no mission
 other than getting
 these people home.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.095
RUSH: It was never
 about going home,

00:27.128 --> 00:28.662
it's about getting us
 to where we're going.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.432
That is the mission.

00:31.465 --> 00:33.401
That is one hell
 of a battlefield.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.936
WRAY: Was a battlefield.
Now it's a graveyard.

00:35.969 --> 00:37.771
CHLOE:
 It's spreading faster now.

00:37.805 --> 00:40.040
I've tried to fight it,
 but it's stronger than me.

00:40.074 --> 00:43.677
Sooner or later,
 I'm going to stop being me
 and become something else.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.946
There's nothing
 you can do to stop it.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.349
You're telling me you're not
 the least bit weirded out
 flying through this?

00:48.382 --> 00:49.917
GREER:
 Anything that could hurt us

00:49.950 --> 00:51.352
is long dead
 and gone, brother.

00:51.385 --> 00:52.786
SCOTT:
 I think I just saw something.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.021
YOUNG: What is it?
 I'm not sure.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.390
Colonel, this is Camile.
 We're not alone out here.

00:56.424 --> 00:57.958
VOLKER: A ship
just dropped out of FTL.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.260
It's a seed ship.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.994
(ON SPEAKER) Destiny,
 this is Telford.

01:01.028 --> 01:03.030
I got a hell of
 a story to tell you,
 and not much time to tell it.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.397
They call themselves
 the Ursini.

01:04.432 --> 01:07.067
Wait a minute,
these aliens helped you

01:07.101 --> 01:08.402
out of the goodness
of their hearts?

01:08.436 --> 01:10.070
They need our help.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.039
They engage their FTL drives
 while we're docked,

01:12.072 --> 01:13.241
and we jump with them.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.908
WRAY: That's possible?
RUSH: Theoretically, yes.

01:14.942 --> 01:16.310
We've been tricked.

01:16.344 --> 01:17.878
So much for our deal
 with the Ursini.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.213
We just got a message
 from the seed ship.

01:19.247 --> 01:20.748
YOUNG: What does it say?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.983
BRODY:
 "Target the command vessel."

01:23.016 --> 01:24.385
PARK: Shields are weakening,
 and several weapons
 platforms are down!

01:24.418 --> 01:25.919
We might want to
consider falling back.

01:25.953 --> 01:27.155
There's nowhere
 to fall back to.

01:29.990 --> 01:31.159
Step away
 from that console.

01:31.192 --> 01:32.926
It's too late.
 What did you do?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.128
Chloe, what did you do?

01:46.474 --> 01:48.176
There's hundreds
 of these things!

01:48.209 --> 01:49.410
There's no way
 we're gonna be able to
 shoot them all down.

01:49.443 --> 01:50.844
What about
 the main weapon?

01:50.878 --> 01:51.912
No, that's useless
against the drones.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.414
The Command ship's
 out of range.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.848
It'd just be
 a waste of power.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.350
(EXPLOSIONS RUMBLING)

01:57.518 --> 01:59.720
Chloe, tell me
what you did.

02:01.389 --> 02:03.191
I sent a signal.
 To who?

02:05.058 --> 02:07.228
No! No, no, no, no,
easy, easy!
Stand down!

02:09.396 --> 02:11.265
Don't move.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.033
Wait, wait, wait!
 Just wait, wait!

02:13.801 --> 02:15.803
Chloe...

02:15.836 --> 02:20.508
Look, the aliens
 who took me, they followed us
 to this galaxy.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.843
They've been
 looking for us
 ever since.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.478
Now they know
 where we are.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.503
Three hyperspace
 windows just opened.

02:49.537 --> 02:50.804
YOUNG: More drones?

02:50.838 --> 02:51.839
No, they're ships.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.375
It's the aliens
from the other galaxy.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.217
They're headed
straight for us.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.057
She sold us out.

03:10.090 --> 03:10.924
Just hang on.

03:13.394 --> 03:15.329
I told you this might
 come down to you and me.

03:15.363 --> 03:19.433
I know, but not now, not yet.
 I'm still in control.

03:19.467 --> 03:21.902
I did it to help us.
 It's our only chance.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.237
What are you talking about?

03:34.315 --> 03:36.049
Half the drones
 just veered off.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.018
They're attacking
 the alien ships.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.086
RUSH:
 They don't discriminate.

03:39.119 --> 03:41.121
Anything that's not part
of the cluster is a target.

03:41.154 --> 03:42.222
We might just be able
to hold them off now.

03:51.332 --> 03:54.101
Sorry, sorry!
Some of them are
still getting through!

03:54.134 --> 03:56.270
Colonel, this is Scott.
 We found Chloe.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.272
It looks like she may have
 given away our position

03:58.306 --> 03:59.340
to the aliens
 who took her.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.909
Roger that, Lieutenant.
We got them on our screens.

04:01.942 --> 04:05.646
Sir, she says she did it
 as a diversion,
 to give us a chance

04:05.679 --> 04:08.048
to get to the Command ship.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.216
I was gonna say
 it's our chance
 to get the hell out of here.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.984
No, we'll never get
out of this system,
not without FTL.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.152
Put her in a holding cell

04:12.185 --> 04:13.854
and this time make sure
she doesn't get out.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.458
Yes, sir.

04:19.327 --> 04:20.994
Everett, I hate to say it
 but I think Rush is right.

04:21.028 --> 04:22.396
This could be
 our only chance.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.465
There's a lot of drones
 protecting that Command ship.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.166
If we do this,
 we're gonna take
 pretty heavy fire.

04:26.199 --> 04:27.568
ELI: Maybe not.
 I've been thinking.

04:27.601 --> 04:29.637
They all take their orders
 from the Command ship, right?

04:29.670 --> 04:32.239
Probably through
 some sort of
 subspace communication.

04:32.272 --> 04:36.009
Well, what if we could
 jam that signal
 even for just a few seconds?

04:36.043 --> 04:37.110
That might give us
 the time that we need.

04:38.178 --> 04:39.447
Can that work?
 It just might.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.315
Let's plot a course
 for the Command ship.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.617
Eli, go. I'll help
 with the weapons.

04:43.651 --> 04:44.885
Give me all the speed
 you can muster.

04:57.297 --> 05:01.234
Believe whatever
 you want, Matt,
 but I did this for all of us.

05:13.681 --> 05:15.916
Three-man detail
 here at all times.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.251
Yes, sir.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.062
We're on course
 for the Command ship.
 We'll be there in two minutes.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.664
YOUNG: How's it coming, Rush?
 Almost there.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.332
(EXPLOSIONS)

05:32.366 --> 05:33.967
We just lost
 another shield generator.

05:34.001 --> 05:35.569
We've got
 multiple hull breaches.

05:35.603 --> 05:36.737
Seal off
all affected areas.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.205
Prep the main weapon.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.041
(WHIRRING)

05:42.510 --> 05:44.344
(ALARM BLARING)

05:44.378 --> 05:46.046
Shields are failing.
 If we keep up
 this acceleration

05:46.079 --> 05:47.415
we're going to
 lose hull integrity.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.016
Now would be
 a good time, Rush!

05:49.049 --> 05:50.217
I should have just
 kept my mouth shut.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.084
Patience, Eli.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.055
All right,
I've got it.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.067
The drones have
 stopped firing.
 It's working!

06:07.100 --> 06:08.636
Are we in range?
Just a few more seconds.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.605
They're gonna
re-establish the signal!

06:11.639 --> 06:12.640
RUSH: Just hold on.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.710
That's it, we're in range.
 Fire!

06:27.655 --> 06:28.756
Got them.

06:28.789 --> 06:29.690
Nice shooting.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.525
There's no sign of
activity from the drones.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.126
It looks like
 they've all gone dormant.

06:33.160 --> 06:34.662
See what you can do
 when you apply yourself?

06:37.498 --> 06:40.434
How's it going
 with those aliens,
 Chloe's friends?

06:40.468 --> 06:41.569
Two of the ships
 were destroyed
 in the battle.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.636
The other one's
 just sitting there.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.307
That's giving off
 a lot of radiation.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.443
Probably just as damaged
 as we are.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.678
Well, let's hope so.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.689
JOHANSEN: That's good.
 Okay, thank you.

07:06.326 --> 07:07.495
How's it going?

07:07.528 --> 07:10.330
Could be worse I suppose.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.500
A lot of minor injuries,
 couple of serious burns,

07:12.533 --> 07:14.702
but no fatalities.

07:16.537 --> 07:17.638
What about Baras?

07:21.875 --> 07:25.312
Chloe broke his arm
 in two places.

07:25.345 --> 07:26.647
Did you know she could do
 something like that?

07:28.482 --> 07:29.517
No.

07:31.819 --> 07:34.488
All right, the good news is
 FTL didn't take
 any more damage.

07:34.522 --> 07:37.090
In fact, we should have it
 back online pretty soon.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.526
And the bad news?

07:38.559 --> 07:41.194
Um, you're
looking at it.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.429
It's a shield
 emitter relay.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.633
There are four more
 just like it,
 completely burned out.

07:45.666 --> 07:47.835
We have to bypass them
 before we can restore
 full coverage,

07:47.868 --> 07:49.436
which we need
 in order to jump.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.538
How long?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.839
Couple hours
 at least.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.374
Keep me posted.
Where's Rush?

07:54.407 --> 07:56.844
Last I heard he was
 heading to
 the Control Interface Room.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.682
Okay, want to
 grab a flashlight?

08:07.154 --> 08:09.623
Just going over
 Chloe's handiwork.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.325
You know, she bypassed
 the communications panel
 on the bridge,

08:12.359 --> 08:13.794
and that took some doing.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.428
Well, she claims
 she did it to help us.

08:16.830 --> 08:19.166
And so it did.
 This time.

08:19.199 --> 08:22.570
Wait a minute,
I thought you liked
the new Chloe.

08:22.603 --> 08:25.305
Well, did I ever
 give the impression
 I didn't like the old one?

08:25.338 --> 08:27.541
Just because
 I took a pragmatic approach
 to her situation

08:27.575 --> 08:31.178
doesn't mean to say
 I don't care for her.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.413
If I could have done
 something to stop it,
 I would have.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.916
She took out a guard
 twice her size.

08:35.948 --> 08:39.251
Yeah, and walked through
 a lock-down protocol
 like it wasn't there.

08:39.285 --> 08:44.892
Neither of us
 may want to admit this,
 she's beyond our control.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.426
Everett, this is David.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.428
Go ahead.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.763
I've been in contact
 with the Ursini
 on the seed ship.

08:49.797 --> 08:50.798
We've got a problem.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.401
What the hell
were they thinking?

08:55.302 --> 08:56.904
They didn't trust us.

08:56.937 --> 08:58.606
They thought the second
 we were clear of the system,

08:58.639 --> 09:00.741
we'd be on our merry way
 and leave them
 holding the bag.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.443
Well, that would have been
 the logical thing to do.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.814
It's not our fight.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.783
Well, it is now.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.953
With the drones
 deactivated,

09:12.986 --> 09:15.555
the Ursini thought
 it was safe to finally
 contact their colony.

09:15.589 --> 09:18.291
The signal
 that they got back
 was in machine language.

09:18.325 --> 09:19.960
It was another Command ship.

09:19.993 --> 09:22.596
The only possible conclusion
 is that
 the colony had been found

09:22.630 --> 09:24.798
by a second cluster
 and destroyed.

09:24.832 --> 09:26.834
So they really are
 the last of their kind.

09:29.670 --> 09:34.608
More than likely,
but that's not
the only problem.

09:34.642 --> 09:37.444
When they sent the signal,
 they gave away our position.

09:37.477 --> 09:38.478
Exactly.

09:40.313 --> 09:41.915
More drones are coming.

09:47.788 --> 09:48.922
Could you
hold it up, please?

09:50.658 --> 09:51.659
Progress, gentlemen?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.494
Flashlight?

09:54.527 --> 09:57.665
Yeah, we've run a bypass
 through this section.

09:57.698 --> 09:58.498
We're about to test it.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.700
Okay, we're good to go.

10:02.836 --> 10:03.971
BRODY: Park, you reading me?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.405
Go ahead.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.641
Let's power up, say 10%.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.209
Copy. 10%.

10:11.511 --> 10:12.780
Okay, here it comes.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.318
So far so good.

10:19.386 --> 10:20.520
Let's go to 50.

10:21.321 --> 10:21.889
Roger. 50.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.330
Cut it, cut it,
 cut it!

10:40.007 --> 10:42.710
Okay, so it might take
 longer than we thought.

10:48.749 --> 10:49.750
Flashlight?

10:52.652 --> 10:55.455
Wait. I thought
 the FTL was fixed.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.291
It is, but without
 full shield coverage,

10:58.325 --> 11:01.294
we risk tearing the ship apart
 the second we jump.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.997
How long till
 the second cluster
 gets here?

11:04.031 --> 11:05.766
There's no way
 to know for sure.
 It could be anytime.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.469
I don't suppose
 there's any chance

11:09.502 --> 11:11.571
of negotiating
 with these things?

11:11.604 --> 11:12.973
It's an automated
 weapons system.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.875
The Ursini believe

11:14.908 --> 11:16.376
that the civilization
 that created them
 died out a long time ago.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.912
They're machines.
 One simple directive,

11:18.946 --> 11:22.415
"Find alien technology
 and destroy it."

11:22.449 --> 11:24.051
Reasoning with them
 is not an option.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.519
SCOTT: What about
 the Ursini?

11:26.553 --> 11:28.889
We did a tandem jump
 with them before.
 Why can't we do it again?

11:28.922 --> 11:30.690
Well, that doesn't
 solve our basic problem,

11:30.724 --> 11:32.826
unless they can
 extend their shields

11:32.860 --> 11:35.362
all the way
 around the Destiny,
 which I doubt.

11:35.395 --> 11:38.866
Even if we trusted
 them enough to try it,
 which I'm guessing we don't,

11:38.899 --> 11:40.734
they blew their FTL
by dropping out so quickly.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.870
That was
a one-shot deal
for them.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.339
We managed to jam
 the command signal
 temporarily, right?

11:46.373 --> 11:48.008
Maybe there's a way
 of making it permanent.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.610
Not without
 a greater understanding
 of the technology involved.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.812
Maybe we should
get one.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.684
One of the drones,
 I mean.

11:57.717 --> 12:02.622
Right now those things
are totally harmless,
at least theoretically,

12:02.655 --> 12:04.758
and I'm pretty sure
 we could fit one
 of the smaller ones

12:04.792 --> 12:06.459
in the back
of the shuttle.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.361
SCOTT: Now,
 wait a minute,
 wait a minute.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.562
You want us to bring
 one of those
 things on the ship?

12:09.596 --> 12:13.366
What I want
 is to be as far away
 from here as possible.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.636
You know, he's right.
 It could be very useful.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.405
And very dangerous.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.108
Well, every second
 we stay here is dangerous.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.543
This new cluster's
 going to have its own
 Command ship, right?

12:23.576 --> 12:25.378
RUSH: Yeah, most likely.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.446
All right,
 so when it shows up,

12:26.479 --> 12:29.449
what happens to the drones
 that are already here?

12:29.482 --> 12:31.651
Well, that's just
 one of those things

12:31.684 --> 12:33.854
we're going to have to try
 and find out, isn't it?

12:35.455 --> 12:36.023
Suit up.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.397
So, you really think
 this is a good idea?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.633
I think we don't
 get paid to think.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.001
We get paid?

12:48.768 --> 12:49.837
Hey!

12:51.538 --> 12:53.140
What are you doing here?

12:53.173 --> 12:54.474
I guess it's my turn
 to go for a ride.

12:59.679 --> 13:00.780
Congratulations.

13:07.888 --> 13:10.623
SCOTT: All right, sir,
 we are all cross-checked
 and good to go.

13:10.657 --> 13:11.524
Lieutenant, be careful.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.860
Copy that.

13:12.893 --> 13:14.461
Launching shuttle.

13:23.904 --> 13:24.905
Any activity
 from the drones?

13:28.575 --> 13:29.742
Nothing yet.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.081
We got a big one
coming up here,
2:00 high.

13:44.091 --> 13:45.893
No reaction.
 It looks like
 Eli was right.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.528
Well, that doesn't mean

13:48.561 --> 13:49.662
I want you spending
any more time out
there than necessary.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.564
Let's get this done,
 get you back inside.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.200
I've got a candidate.
 Two kilometers dead ahead.

13:56.103 --> 13:56.937
Let's go get it.

13:59.606 --> 14:00.908
Open the door.

14:06.914 --> 14:07.915
(SIGHS) I'm sorry
 about this.

14:12.552 --> 14:13.887
After what I did
 to Corporal Baras,

14:13.921 --> 14:15.455
I can hardly
 blame them, can I?

14:31.804 --> 14:33.073
GREER: Just breathe normally.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.044
You all right.

14:37.077 --> 14:39.246
I'm good.

14:39.279 --> 14:41.048
SCOTT: I'm switching
 off artificial gravity.
 Going to mag boots.

14:41.949 --> 14:42.782
Roger that.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.820
Venting atmosphere.

14:55.162 --> 14:57.064
Keep your eye on
 those screens, Sergeant.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.670
I see it.
 Open the door.

15:14.147 --> 15:17.750
Okay, we need to
 move left
 about a meter.

15:30.030 --> 15:32.865
Okay, now down a little.

15:46.013 --> 15:47.714
Now straight back.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.304
That's it, we got it.

16:11.338 --> 16:12.339
SCOTT: Re-pressurizing.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.746
Now, slowly
 reinstate artificial gravity.

16:23.750 --> 16:24.851
(PANTING)

16:26.319 --> 16:27.787
I said slowly.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.289
SCOTT: Sorry.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.190
Is it doing anything?

16:34.261 --> 16:36.829
I don't think so.
 I think we're good.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.368
I need your status,
Lieutenant.

16:41.401 --> 16:42.869
SCOTT: Sir,
 we got it onboard.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.204
It doesn't seem to
 be doing anything,

16:44.237 --> 16:45.805
so I guess
 we're gonna head back.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.040
Nice work.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.808
(ALERT BEEPS)

16:48.841 --> 16:49.876
Hang on.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.315
We've got movement
 out there.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Proximity alert.

16:59.252 --> 17:00.753
PARK: Is it a drone?
GREER: I don't think so.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.389
Too big. Way too big.

17:18.137 --> 17:18.938
Oh, boy.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.377
Sir, we got
 a little problem here.

17:25.412 --> 17:28.013
That alien ship,
 the one that
 survived the battle,

17:28.047 --> 17:30.083
it just parked itself
 right in front of us.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.218
Well, what's it doing?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.719
Right now,
 it's just sitting there.

17:38.091 --> 17:41.128
I'm gonna try something here.
 I'm gonna try
 backing away real slow.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.364
PARK: Are you sure
that's a good idea?

17:44.397 --> 17:45.932
Well, we got to
 get this thing
 back to the ship.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.900
Can't stay
 out here forever.

17:47.934 --> 17:49.035
(CONSOLE BEEPS)

17:49.068 --> 17:50.303
Wait, we're getting
 a message.

17:50.337 --> 17:51.338
GREER: What's it say?

17:57.310 --> 17:58.245
"No escape."

18:02.182 --> 18:05.152
So they're saying that
 if the shuttle tries
 to return to Destiny,

18:05.185 --> 18:09.222
or if we make
 any hostile moves,
 they will open fire.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.957
TELFORD: What do they want?
 Our help.

18:10.990 --> 18:12.159
They've intercepted
 the Ursini's signal.

18:12.192 --> 18:14.327
They know
another wave is coming.

18:14.361 --> 18:18.165
It's a ploy to keep us here,
 force us to help
 fend off the drones

18:18.198 --> 18:20.333
while they get their
 hyperdrive back online.

18:20.367 --> 18:22.802
But we need the shuttle.
 We need to
 study the drone.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.171
I say we call
 their bluff.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.405
Let them know
 what's happening.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.973
Agree to help them
 only on the condition

18:27.006 --> 18:28.508
that they let
 the shuttle come back.

18:28.541 --> 18:31.077
They'll assume we're lying.
They don't know
that we can't jump.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.279
YOUNG: I don't think
 we give them a choice.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.314
If they're half as
 badly damaged as we are,

18:34.347 --> 18:35.815
they're not going
to want to fight.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.450
They're going to
 have to trust us.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.753
We're going to have
 to trust each other.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.988
They've got
 something we need.

18:42.021 --> 18:43.022
What are you
talking about?

18:43.055 --> 18:44.123
Chloe.

18:44.157 --> 18:45.792
What about her?

18:45.825 --> 18:48.761
If anyone can undo
 what's happening to her,
 it's them.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.763
They're the ones
 who did it to her
 in the first place.

18:50.797 --> 18:52.365
You want us to
 send her over there,
 with all that's happened?

18:52.399 --> 18:53.866
With everything
 that she knows
 about this ship?

18:53.900 --> 18:55.368
We've exhausted
 all medical avenues.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.304
We cannot keep her
 onboard the ship.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.976
This could be
 our last chance.

19:04.010 --> 19:09.216
The Colonel's not
 going to force you to go,
 but if you don't,

19:09.249 --> 19:13.853
chances are he'll
 put you off the ship
 at the first opportunity.

19:15.322 --> 19:17.324
Doesn't seem like
 you have much to lose.

19:17.357 --> 19:18.925
You've never been on
 one of those ships.

19:20.560 --> 19:21.861
I'm sorry.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.266
I wish I could have
 done more to help you.

19:31.103 --> 19:32.939
With all due respect,
 sir, it sounds crazy.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.842
How do we know
they'll do what they say,

19:35.875 --> 19:37.410
how do we even know
 they'll give her back?

19:37.444 --> 19:39.212
Look, I know
 this is difficult,
 Lieutenant,

19:39.246 --> 19:40.913
but we've
 run out of options.

19:43.250 --> 19:45.885
Yes, sir, if you say so.

19:45.918 --> 19:47.186
(CONSOLE BEEPS)
 RUSH:
 They're sending a message.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.125
They've agreed
to our proposal.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.539
You do realize
 there's a good chance

20:06.573 --> 20:08.508
this is what they
 wanted all along.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.511
Everett, listen to me.
 I've been trying
 to contact the Ursini.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.880
They're not
 responding anymore.
 The seed ship's gone dark.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.448
So?

20:15.482 --> 20:17.584
So maybe that's something
 we should consider.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.253
Power down completely,
 everything but
 minimum life support.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.421
If we have no
 energy signature,

20:21.454 --> 20:23.390
then we're just another
hunk of metal
in the graveyard.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.057
But even if we're
 not giving off EM,

20:25.091 --> 20:27.260
we're still going to
 stand out like a sore thumb.

20:27.294 --> 20:29.061
I'm just saying
 maybe they know
 something that we don't.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.097
They have fought
 these things before.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.965
Yeah, and they...
 They got wiped out,
 didn't they?

21:02.595 --> 21:04.931
You sure
 you want to bring
 this thing inside?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.999
We need to hook it up
 to the ship's
 diagnostic equipment.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.167
It's the only way.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.035
ELI: Is it heavy?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.404
One way to find out.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.005
Why don't you go
 grab that Kino sled?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.874
All right, thanks.

21:36.563 --> 21:40.299
On three...
 One, two, three!

21:40.333 --> 21:41.668
(ALL GRUNTING)

21:44.236 --> 21:46.639
Yeah, it's heavy.
 It's heavy.

21:46.673 --> 21:48.240
Okay, ease it down.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.448
You better
 be sure about this.

21:55.482 --> 21:57.917
All right, let's move.
 Let's get out of here.

22:02.188 --> 22:05.224
I have to say
 I'm a little surprised
 that you of all people

22:05.257 --> 22:07.126
would be the one
 to suggest this plan.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.061
Why's that, then?

22:09.095 --> 22:11.964
For all we know,
 they're going to download
 every scrap of information

22:11.998 --> 22:14.467
she has about Destiny
 the second
 they get her onboard.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.569
Well, with Chloe
 back to normal,

22:16.603 --> 22:19.506
the odds of them
 ever tracking us again
 are virtually nil.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.240
Doesn't matter
 what they discover
 about the ship.

22:21.273 --> 22:23.410
Yeah, assuming
 they honor the deal.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.177
Well, there's
no point
in keeping her.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.980
If she begins
 to change again,
 we'll soon know, won't we?

22:28.014 --> 22:29.982
Well, still,
 if I didn't know
 any better,

22:30.016 --> 22:31.217
it almost
 looks like
 you're willing

22:31.250 --> 22:33.019
to put the ship and
 the mission at risk

22:33.052 --> 22:35.588
for the sake of
 one individual.

22:35.622 --> 22:38.958
Well, that's the problem,
 isn't it?
 You don't know any better.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.152
I'll take her
 over there, sir.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.222
CHLOE: Colonel...

23:19.499 --> 23:20.500
Good luck.

23:26.673 --> 23:29.108
Okay.
 Now what?

23:49.095 --> 23:50.597
Looks like
 there's a catch here.

23:50.630 --> 23:52.565
VOLKER: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
 You think that's a good idea?

23:52.599 --> 23:54.767
Well, if we can't open it,
 we can't study it.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.379
(BRODY YELPS)

24:14.721 --> 24:15.722
Okay.

24:16.789 --> 24:17.724
Now what?

24:33.540 --> 24:35.575
Looks like
they're inviting us in.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.397
If you would've asked me
 a couple of years ago

25:31.430 --> 25:33.299
where I'd be today,

25:34.801 --> 25:38.270
this would not
 have been
 one of my guesses.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.708
Chloe, you were right.
 I let it get to me.

25:43.610 --> 25:45.612
I let it change
 the way I look at you.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.246
No, it's not
 your fault.

25:55.487 --> 25:58.625
The time that I have
 spent on that ship,

25:58.658 --> 26:01.327
I'm not gonna lie,
 it's been hard.

26:03.963 --> 26:06.565
But some of it has
 also been amazing

26:08.901 --> 26:11.971
and that is
because of you.

26:12.004 --> 26:16.242
If you hadn't been there,
 I don't think I would
 have made it this far.

26:16.275 --> 26:19.411
That's not true.
 You're much stronger
 than that.

26:19.445 --> 26:21.881
You just don't know it.

26:21.914 --> 26:25.685
This is my moment, okay?
 Don't contradict me.

26:45.638 --> 26:46.706
I love you.

26:47.840 --> 26:49.308
I love you, too.

27:19.505 --> 27:21.440
RUSH: Progress?

27:21.473 --> 27:24.276
Well, we've managed
to crack the
basic machine code,

27:24.310 --> 27:26.545
but the programming
 is incredibly complex.

27:26.578 --> 27:29.015
We're trying to isolate
 the subroutine that
 regulates communication

27:29.048 --> 27:31.517
with the Command ship,
 but so far no luck.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.753
No, this is excellent work.

27:34.921 --> 27:35.755
Well done.

27:38.590 --> 27:39.892
Thank you.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.728
Eli and I will
 take over from here.

27:41.761 --> 27:44.396
I need you two
 back on shield duty.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.998
Kemp and his team...
 Oh, they're very
 competent I'm sure,

27:46.032 --> 27:47.399
but we're
 against the clock,

27:47.433 --> 27:48.500
and I need
to know my best
people are on it.

27:50.036 --> 27:51.303
Okay.

27:51.337 --> 27:52.471
A full report in an hour,
 understood?

27:52.504 --> 27:53.539
You got it.

27:57.944 --> 28:01.580
Wow, that was almost nice.

28:01.613 --> 28:02.849
No, they were just
 going to get in the way.

28:02.882 --> 28:04.283
Let's get down
 to some real work.

28:05.084 --> 28:05.918
Ah.

28:22.034 --> 28:24.937
Destiny,
 this is Scott, come in.

28:24.971 --> 28:27.907
Shoot, I don't know,
 maybe you're reading this.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.575
I'm in some
 kind of hangar bay,

28:29.608 --> 28:31.110
they could be
 blocking the signal.

28:31.143 --> 28:33.612
The aliens took Chloe.

28:33.645 --> 28:36.783
Jeez, it was only
 a few minutes ago,
 feels like it was hours.

28:36.816 --> 28:37.950
I don't know,
 I guess there's no way
 of knowing

28:37.984 --> 28:39.786
how long
 this is gonna take.

28:39.819 --> 28:40.820
I'm not leaving
 without her.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.957
I just...
 I don't know, I...

28:48.460 --> 28:49.762
I just hope
 she's gonna be okay.

28:52.498 --> 28:53.933
(HEARTBEAT POUNDING)

29:47.553 --> 29:49.521
Second Command ship
 just dropped out
 of hyperspace.

29:49.555 --> 29:50.789
Drones are en route.

29:50.823 --> 29:52.024
ETA?
 Twelve minutes.

29:53.059 --> 29:55.427
Rush, come in.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.463
Second wave just dropped out.
 They're on their way.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.698
Have any activity
 on the drone?

29:59.731 --> 30:02.034
Negative. Are any
 of the others from the
 first group powering up?

30:02.068 --> 30:04.436
So far, nothing.
 Still dormant.

30:04.470 --> 30:06.105
Well, that answers
 one question.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.206
They're not
 taking orders from
 the new Command ship.

30:07.239 --> 30:09.976
That gives me an idea.
 Hang on.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.810
YOUNG:
 Rush, what about the plan?

30:11.844 --> 30:13.779
Can we permanently disrupt
 their communications or not?

30:13.812 --> 30:16.048
Well, unfortunately,
 it seems like there's no way
 to jam the signal

30:16.082 --> 30:18.717
for any longer
than a few seconds
before they adapt.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.953
Not long enough in
 a battle situation.

30:20.987 --> 30:22.221
We're pursuing alternatives.

30:22.254 --> 30:23.890
Such as?

30:23.923 --> 30:25.591
Well, you'll be
 the first to know.
 Rush out.

30:30.262 --> 30:33.165
Lieutenant, how much
 training have you had
 with these systems?

30:33.199 --> 30:34.901
As much as anyone
 else on the ship, sir.

30:34.934 --> 30:36.468
Which is?

30:36.502 --> 30:38.470
About an hour, simulated.

30:38.504 --> 30:39.805
All right,
 you're going to do fine.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.974
I want you to handle
 power distribution.

30:42.008 --> 30:43.742
Do not let any of
 the active emitters
 drop below critical,

30:43.775 --> 30:44.911
and stay on top
of any sections

30:44.944 --> 30:46.145
that lose
 atmospheric pressure.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.513
Yes, sir.

30:47.546 --> 30:48.214
(ALERTS BEEPING)

30:48.247 --> 30:50.082
Oh, crap.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.484
David, focus your fire
 on any drones
 approaching areas

30:52.518 --> 30:54.020
where the shields
 are still down.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.754
Copy, but they're
 gonna clue in eventually.

30:55.787 --> 30:56.788
I know.

31:32.291 --> 31:35.561
Hey, Chloe?
 You all right?

31:35.594 --> 31:37.930
You're gonna be okay.
 I'm going to
 get you home.

31:47.974 --> 31:49.808
(EXPLOSIONS RUMBLING)

31:49.841 --> 31:50.909
There's a lot of targets!

31:50.943 --> 31:51.810
You've got this, David.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.592
Whoa!

32:08.094 --> 32:10.129
Destiny, this is Scott.

32:10.162 --> 32:11.597
Lieutenant,
what's your status?

32:11.630 --> 32:12.764
I've got Chloe.

32:12.798 --> 32:14.166
We're on our way back

32:14.200 --> 32:17.569
but it seems
that we've got
a little problem here.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.305
Yeah,
 you noticed that,
 did you?

32:19.338 --> 32:21.173
SCOTT: I'll take out
 as many as I can.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.175
Negative,
 Lieutenant, we're not
 here to destroy them,

32:23.209 --> 32:25.011
just hang on long
 enough till we jump.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.113
Just keep clear
 of Destiny for now.

32:27.146 --> 32:29.148
They'll focus
 on the larger target.

32:29.181 --> 32:31.017
No, I've got full shields,
 you don't.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.184
Don't worry, sir,
 we'll be okay.

32:40.993 --> 32:43.195
They're starting to realize
 where we're vulnerable.

32:43.229 --> 32:46.332
I'm taking more and more fire
 concentrated on exposed areas.

32:46.365 --> 32:49.335
Rush,
 whatever you're gonna do,
 you got to do it now!

32:49.368 --> 32:51.170
I got it. I got it!

32:51.203 --> 32:56.708
Look at this.
 Recognition software,
 friend or foe.

32:56.742 --> 32:59.045
Right now the drones
 that were here first
 are ignoring the second wave,

32:59.078 --> 33:00.679
because they don't
have a Command ship

33:00.712 --> 33:02.014
telling them
 which side they're on.

33:02.048 --> 33:05.184
What if we tell them
that they're the enemy?

33:05.217 --> 33:08.220
We use the same ID tag
 that they used for us.

33:08.254 --> 33:09.988
Yeah, that could work.
The only problem is

33:10.022 --> 33:12.224
if we want to
 upload the new program
 to the other drones...

33:12.258 --> 33:14.160
We'd have to power
 this one up first.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.406
You want to what?

33:27.439 --> 33:29.341
RUSH: Look,
 there's no other way.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.243
If that thing starts shooting,
 we're not going to
 be able to stop it.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.145
It will tear us apart
 from the inside.

33:33.179 --> 33:35.047
I don't think
 that's gonna happen.

33:35.081 --> 33:37.015
Sergeant Greer,
 I need a security team
 in the lab

33:37.049 --> 33:39.151
where they're working
 on the drone, now.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.319
GREER: Roger that.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.221
PARK: We've got
 a new problem.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.022
The alien ship just
 jumped to hyperspace.

33:44.056 --> 33:45.857
Good for them.

33:45.891 --> 33:48.927
No, but the drones
 they were attacking,
 they're heading our way.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.229
That's too many.
 We can't hold
 them all off at once.

33:50.262 --> 33:51.997
Rush, how long till
 that program is ready?

33:52.030 --> 33:52.964
Give us five minutes.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.768
(EXPLOSIONS RUMBLING)

33:56.802 --> 33:57.903
You don't have
five minutes.

34:16.987 --> 34:18.690
Destiny, I'm not sure
 if you're seeing this

34:18.724 --> 34:21.693
but you've got a whole bunch
 more of those drones
 coming your way.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.395
We're tracking them.
 I want you out of there.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.130
Sir...

34:25.164 --> 34:27.299
I just gave you
a direct order, Lieutenant.
Break off now.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.333
Yes, sir.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.107
What are you doing here?

34:35.141 --> 34:36.375
Colonel's orders.

34:36.408 --> 34:38.310
So, what, if we manage
 to power up this drone,

34:38.344 --> 34:39.978
and it starts
 opening fire,

34:40.011 --> 34:41.213
do you think
 there's anything
 you can do to stop it?

34:41.246 --> 34:42.813
I'm sure as hell
 gonna try.

34:45.784 --> 34:46.985
I'm getting
 damage reports
 from all over the ship,

34:47.018 --> 34:48.387
multiple
 secondary explosions.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.158
Rush, you're out of time.
 Rush!

34:52.190 --> 34:54.159
Something's happening,
 drones are veering off!

34:54.193 --> 34:55.860
Sir, it's the seed ship!

35:04.203 --> 35:07.439
The Ursini are making a run
 for the Command ship.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.975
They don't have the firepower
 or shields to get through.

35:10.008 --> 35:12.010
I thought they were
 going to wait it out.

35:12.043 --> 35:13.945
Sir, we're getting
 a message.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.147
TELFORD:
 Patch it through to me.

35:23.222 --> 35:25.324
It says they're sorry
for getting us into this.

35:25.357 --> 35:26.292
It's a suicide run.

35:37.303 --> 35:38.370
They're gone.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.980
Rush, we've just
 been given a window
 that's gonna close fast.

35:49.014 --> 35:50.249
Activate the damn program.

35:58.089 --> 35:59.191
(POWERING UP)

36:02.261 --> 36:04.062
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
 Hold your fire,
 hold your fire.

36:10.236 --> 36:11.903
Eli, upload the program.

36:27.085 --> 36:29.388
Destiny this is Scott.
 Whatever you guys did,
 it worked.

36:29.421 --> 36:30.856
These drones are
 firing on each other.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.859
We should be able
 to dock now.

36:34.526 --> 36:37.496
Make it quick, Lieutenant.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.431
Okay, I'm good.
 You good? Are we good?

36:39.465 --> 36:41.833
Yeah, we're good.
 Bridge, this is Brody.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.535
We're ready with
 our last bypass.
 You can power it up.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.136
Let's do it.

36:55.146 --> 36:56.282
Looks like it's holding.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.450
Status?

36:58.484 --> 37:02.854
Shields are now
 covering the whole ship,
 but they're only at 5% power.

37:02.888 --> 37:03.889
We've just
 taken too many hits.

37:03.922 --> 37:05.424
What's minimum safe?

37:05.457 --> 37:09.194
We've never jumped
 at less than 10%.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.463
Rush, this is Young.
 We're ready here,
 but we have a small problem.

37:11.497 --> 37:13.399
Shields are holding at 5%.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.067
That's not enough.
We're talking about
FTL here.

37:16.101 --> 37:18.437
One small weak spot
and the entire ship
gets ripped apart.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.472
We don't have a choice.

37:20.506 --> 37:22.274
Even if the program holds,
 and there's no guarantee
 that it will,

37:22.308 --> 37:23.975
the first wave is
 seriously outnumbered.

37:24.009 --> 37:25.143
They'll be massacred
 in a matter of minutes,

37:25.176 --> 37:26.578
and we're right back
 where we started.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.180
We have to take the risk.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.152
This is Scott.
 The shuttle is docked.

37:35.521 --> 37:36.355
Let's go for it.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.593
FTL in three...

37:45.196 --> 37:45.997

38:28.239 --> 38:29.908
I think we're
 going to be okay.

38:42.721 --> 38:45.223
You might want to shut
 this thing down now.

38:45.256 --> 38:47.158
Oh, right, yeah.
 Good idea.

39:08.113 --> 39:10.215
How's the patient?

39:10.248 --> 39:14.520
So far, blood work is normal,
 lesions are gone
 and no more blackouts.

39:14.553 --> 39:16.254
As far as I can tell,
 she's cured.

39:16.287 --> 39:18.323
I'm glad to hear it,
 but just in case...

39:18.356 --> 39:22.027
I know. You want to
 keep me under observation
 for a while.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.094
It's okay,
 I understand.

39:23.128 --> 39:25.063
Well, it's good
 to have you back.

39:25.096 --> 39:27.499
Hey, I'll come see you
 as soon as I can, okay?

39:27.533 --> 39:28.534
Okay.

39:31.236 --> 39:33.271
YOUNG: Hey, how's that
 damage report coming?

39:33.304 --> 39:35.040
I'll arrange
a briefing
when we're ready,

39:35.073 --> 39:36.642
but it's not
 going to be pretty.

39:38.309 --> 39:39.310
Hey.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.614
You wanted to see me?

39:42.648 --> 39:48.554
Yeah. Matt told me
 it was your idea
 to send me over there.

39:48.587 --> 39:53.592
Yeah. I'm sorry
 you had to go through that.
 There was no other way.

39:53.625 --> 39:57.996
No, I wanted to thank you.
 You saved my life.

39:59.230 --> 40:01.032
Again.

40:01.066 --> 40:05.070
Well, you saved all of us.
 It was the least I could do.

40:05.103 --> 40:08.073
They're never
 going to give up.
 You know that, right?

40:08.106 --> 40:09.641
Whatever information
 they got from me,

40:09.675 --> 40:11.477
it's just going to make them
 want the ship even more.

40:12.644 --> 40:13.645
Yeah, I know.

40:16.147 --> 40:17.683
Before Matt came in,

40:20.085 --> 40:21.653
I was working on
 some equations,

40:21.687 --> 40:23.188
just to see if
 I could still do it.

40:35.601 --> 40:36.768
They're perfect.

40:36.802 --> 40:39.337
But I'm supposed to
be back to normal.

40:39.370 --> 40:43.341
Obviously they haven't
 wiped your memory.

40:43.374 --> 40:47.178
You managed to retain
 some of the knowledge
 you gained.

40:47.212 --> 40:50.181
I should think
 that's a good thing.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.150
Because I can
 still be useful?

40:52.183 --> 40:55.120
Everyone on this ship
 is useful,

40:55.153 --> 40:57.823
not just those
 that are capable
 of FTL calculations.

40:57.856 --> 40:59.691
We all belong here.

40:59.725 --> 41:01.026
You really believe that?

41:04.896 --> 41:06.064
More and more every day.

41:08.299 --> 41:12.704
If Colonel Young
 hadn't left me
 on that planet,

41:12.738 --> 41:16.875
to be found by those aliens,
 and if they hadn't taken you,

41:16.908 --> 41:19.545
and you hadn't
 been put through
 that transformation,

41:19.578 --> 41:22.447
well, it's more than likely
 we wouldn't have
 survived this attack.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.850
So everything
 happens for a reason.

41:27.318 --> 41:31.189
Yeah, well,
 if you'd said that to me
 a couple of years ago,

41:31.222 --> 41:33.692
I'd have dismissed it
 as superstition,

41:33.725 --> 41:37.195
a classic weak-minded response
 to the overwhelming complexity
 of the universe.

41:37.929 --> 41:39.164
And now?

41:43.569 --> 41:45.203
Well, let's just say
 you're not the only one

41:45.236 --> 41:46.271
that's gone
 through some changes.

41:50.776 --> 41:52.778
You should get some rest.

41:54.379 --> 41:55.280
Yeah.
