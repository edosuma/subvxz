01:02.128 --> 01:03.662
Drone buster.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.404
Ah, there you are.

01:30.956 --> 01:32.391
Shh. Shh.

01:39.965 --> 01:41.130
Did you get that shit?

01:41.132 --> 01:43.435
In Technicolor.

01:53.846 --> 01:55.347
For Instagram.

01:56.048 --> 01:57.350
Off the network.

02:17.269 --> 02:19.102
Come on.

02:29.548 --> 02:30.616
Come on.

02:33.151 --> 02:35.118
I got a little ruffle in my penis.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.656
Shit makes me hard.

02:43.596 --> 02:44.595
Where are the Americans?

02:44.597 --> 02:45.796
We're not Americans.

02:45.798 --> 02:47.965
Lower your weapons. We're not Americans.

02:54.907 --> 02:55.705
Shit!

03:13.992 --> 03:14.993
Dead.

03:17.795 --> 03:18.798
Come on.

03:23.235 --> 03:25.538
Get yourself right here.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.574
Come on!

03:30.342 --> 03:31.511
Hold still!

03:45.189 --> 03:47.092
Fucking ass! Come on.

03:51.096 --> 03:52.497
Come on this way, Seb.

07:58.976 --> 08:00.745
Here is to America with you.

08:02.480 --> 08:03.815
I'll come back for you.

08:26.370 --> 08:28.238
Fuck, yes.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.072
Did that get you?

08:30.074 --> 08:32.308
- It got me.
- It got me so good,

08:32.311 --> 08:33.509
- wow.
- Wow!

08:33.510 --> 08:34.578
Hm. Thank you.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.011
I got misty eye, did you?

08:36.014 --> 08:37.179
<i>A little.</i>

08:37.182 --> 08:39.582
- A little.
- That's unusual for Adi, he doesn't emote.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.017
- Not at all.
- Incredible.

08:41.019 --> 08:42.051
- Really.
- Wow.

08:42.053 --> 08:43.453
So this is an accurate recreation

08:43.455 --> 08:44.487
of Devlin's ordeal.

08:44.489 --> 08:46.122
All of this happened more or less?

08:46.124 --> 08:47.523
To the best of my knowledge, yeah.

08:47.525 --> 08:49.059
I like him. I'm sold. I'm in.

08:49.061 --> 08:52.195
Look at that face, I mean,
he's just... haunting.

08:52.197 --> 08:54.064
Audiences are gonna love him.
They're gonna wanna hug him.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.265
They're gonna wanna take him home.

08:55.267 --> 08:57.233
I mean, he bleeds red, white and blue.

08:57.235 --> 08:59.935
He really does. This is someone
we're gonna be rooting for.

08:59.937 --> 09:02.037
He's like a young Hugh Laurie, kinda...

09:02.039 --> 09:03.739
- <i>Hugh Laurie.</i>
- <i>Red, white and blue.</i>

09:03.741 --> 09:05.108
- <i>Hugh Laurie, right?</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

09:05.110 --> 09:06.676
- <i>Right.</i>
- <i>From</i> Blackadder. <i>Yeah.</i>

09:06.678 --> 09:08.377
<i>Actually most people know
him from</i> House, <i>so...</i>

09:08.379 --> 09:10.613
- <i>Yeah, it's more like...</i> House.
- <i>House?</i>

09:10.615 --> 09:12.348
- Yeah. Yeah.
- The <i>House?</i>

09:15.187 --> 09:17.152
- Do you want to talk about the girl?
- What girl?

09:17.154 --> 09:18.421
What did you think about the girl?

09:18.423 --> 09:19.723
- I know a lot of girls.
- The Finnish girl.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.324
She's super hot. Yeah, smoking hot.

09:22.326 --> 09:23.292
I like her.

09:23.294 --> 09:24.296
I love her.

09:25.029 --> 09:27.464
She's beautiful. She's sweet...

09:27.466 --> 09:29.265
What happened to the real girl?

09:29.267 --> 09:30.967
That actress is so hot, I wish we
could use some more of her actually.

09:30.969 --> 09:32.234
What happened to the real girl?

09:32.236 --> 09:33.969
Hey, man, do you actually have her number?

09:33.971 --> 09:35.104
Give me her number real quick.

09:35.106 --> 09:37.043
What happened to the real girl?

09:40.011 --> 09:41.377
- Wow.
- So she's dead?

09:41.379 --> 09:43.046
- That's some heavy shit.
- Yikes!

09:58.730 --> 10:00.865
<i>Don't answer.</i>

10:15.846 --> 10:17.280
Send him in.

10:17.282 --> 10:20.252
And you're 100% sure you wanna do this?

10:22.187 --> 10:25.555
Early retirement and a
severance package, mm?

10:25.557 --> 10:27.022
Yeah, I'm sure.

10:27.024 --> 10:30.426
And you understand that
once the show airs...

10:30.428 --> 10:32.262
You can never go back.

10:32.264 --> 10:34.430
- You'll have a complete new identity.
- Right.

10:34.432 --> 10:36.065
A new profession, a new home,

10:36.067 --> 10:38.600
and a plastic surgeon is
going to change your face.

10:38.602 --> 10:39.969
- This thing?
- Yeah.

10:39.971 --> 10:41.570
All righty then.

10:41.572 --> 10:42.906
Wow.

10:42.908 --> 10:46.376
I'll have to say that, you
know, we were very surprised

10:46.378 --> 10:48.848
about your interest in the program.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.946
So?

10:50.948 --> 10:53.118
Why'd I get the application?

10:53.485 --> 10:54.718
Well...

10:54.720 --> 10:56.685
- Well, it went out to...
- Certain operatives.

10:56.687 --> 10:57.921
With certain criteria.

10:57.923 --> 10:59.291
Operatives without families.

11:00.024 --> 11:02.025
No wives, no brothers...

11:02.027 --> 11:03.059
No sisters...

11:03.061 --> 11:05.096
Parents diseased. Yeah, that's me.

11:05.931 --> 11:08.598
Like you said, "Whole new identity."

11:08.600 --> 11:10.900
So...

11:10.902 --> 11:12.035
Where do I sign?

11:13.105 --> 11:15.738
Thomas, I'm from All Eyes Always.

11:15.740 --> 11:17.140
Sorry that Syd is gone for the day,

11:17.142 --> 11:19.111
but we thought you might
like to look at this.

11:58.416 --> 12:00.382
Amanda Artemova?

12:00.384 --> 12:01.950
- Oh, yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

12:01.952 --> 12:03.152
Yes, that's me.

12:03.154 --> 12:04.720
- So nice to meet you.
- So nice to meet you.

12:04.722 --> 12:05.888
- Yeah.
- Welcome.

12:05.890 --> 12:06.989
- Thank you.
- Right this way.

12:06.991 --> 12:08.590
I really love your outfit.

12:08.592 --> 12:10.126
Oh, thank you.

12:10.128 --> 12:11.964
- I love this whole get up.
- Thank you.

12:13.398 --> 12:15.165
- Amanda Artemova, pleasure, I am Sam.
- Hello.

12:15.167 --> 12:16.166
I believe you know Adi.

12:16.168 --> 12:17.400
- Blow it up. Blow it up.
- Hi.

12:17.402 --> 12:18.434
Boom! There we go.

12:18.436 --> 12:19.835
- There we go.
- Okay.

12:19.837 --> 12:22.070
So, before I say anything,

12:22.072 --> 12:25.407
I got to point out how
fucking psyched I am...

12:25.409 --> 12:28.911
- Yeah.
- ...to have you on board.

12:28.913 --> 12:30.546
- We all are.
- Yeah.

12:30.548 --> 12:31.948
I mean...

12:31.950 --> 12:33.983
Oh, how rude of me. Can I get you anything?

12:33.985 --> 12:35.484
- No, no, no.
- Are you sure?

12:35.486 --> 12:36.520
I'm okay, yeah.

12:36.522 --> 12:38.220
She goes with the flow,
ladies and gentleman.

12:38.222 --> 12:39.855
- I say, I like her already.
- Yeah?

12:39.857 --> 12:41.723
The flow has been gone with.

12:41.725 --> 12:43.158
You have a lovely office, mm.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.395
Thank you. Thank you. We, uh,

12:45.397 --> 12:47.597
apologize for the dust. We're remodeling.

12:47.599 --> 12:48.797
Oh, okay.

12:48.799 --> 12:50.834
Listen, Amanda, we're gonna
throw a lot of information

12:50.836 --> 12:52.035
at you right now, okay?

12:52.037 --> 12:53.936
If it gets too fast, if there's too much,

12:53.938 --> 12:56.573
you just stop us, we'll go back, we're gonna
make sure you understand as we go along.

12:56.575 --> 12:58.273
- You just let us know, okay?
- Okay.

12:58.275 --> 13:00.008
- Okay...
- Go on.

13:00.010 --> 13:05.013
What we're talking about is nothing
short of revolutionary. We think,

13:05.015 --> 13:06.882
it's a global project where you bring in

13:06.884 --> 13:08.584
talent from all over the world,

13:08.586 --> 13:12.024
and the interesting
thing is, it's unscripted.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.257
Unscripted?

13:14.259 --> 13:16.758
You're still, you're
still Yulia, the Russian.

13:16.760 --> 13:18.328
But not just Yulia.

13:18.330 --> 13:21.296
You're also playing, if I may,

13:22.466 --> 13:25.068
Isabelle from... Oh!

13:25.070 --> 13:28.137
A firebrand French journalist
who works for <i>Le Monde</i>

13:28.139 --> 13:30.772
with an appetite for mystery.

13:30.774 --> 13:31.741
Dangerous. Danger.

13:31.743 --> 13:33.041
- Danger.
- Danger?

13:33.043 --> 13:34.743
And very sexual.

13:34.745 --> 13:35.777
Oh!

13:35.779 --> 13:36.979
- As you'd expect.
- Actually...

13:36.981 --> 13:38.248
Now, each character

13:38.250 --> 13:41.251
will be assigned different
tasks as the story of Oz.

13:41.253 --> 13:42.555
Are you with us so far?

13:43.120 --> 13:44.320
Let me, uh...

13:44.322 --> 13:45.387
Let me take a step back,

13:45.389 --> 13:47.357
and just try and get out of here.

13:47.359 --> 13:52.728
Basically what we're saying is that Adi,
Elizabeth and myself are going to orchestrate

13:52.730 --> 13:58.267
a handful of events that you and your
fellow actors will simply... respond to.

13:58.269 --> 14:00.502
There's gonna be hidden cameras everywhere.

14:00.504 --> 14:01.771
- Yeah.
- And so, like,

14:01.773 --> 14:03.539
when you normally have a
film or television show,

14:03.541 --> 14:07.377
and there's lights and sounds
and, you know, distractions,

14:07.379 --> 14:09.646
- you won't have that here. You'll just be...
- No.

14:09.648 --> 14:10.647
No cameras.

14:10.649 --> 14:11.781
- No.
- No.

14:11.783 --> 14:13.215
- Well, that you can see.
- just the little ones.

14:13.217 --> 14:14.883
Exactly. Exactly.

14:14.885 --> 14:16.386
But you might not know where they are.

14:16.388 --> 14:17.954
- No.
- Oh, wow.

14:17.956 --> 14:20.323
And our story choices are
going to be response to

14:20.325 --> 14:22.392
what you come up with as your character.

14:22.394 --> 14:25.027
You see, we're saying, you're
gonna be driving the story.

14:25.029 --> 14:26.698
- Uh-hm.
- I am?

14:27.698 --> 14:29.065
- Wow.
- You'll be given

14:29.067 --> 14:30.699
little bits of information,

14:30.701 --> 14:35.305
but you, in many instances, will
not have all of the information.

14:35.307 --> 14:39.041
I just want to say, uh... secondarily,

14:39.043 --> 14:44.546
that one of the missions of the show is to
get the audience thinking about women leading

14:44.548 --> 14:46.549
- in a slightly different way.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:46.551 --> 14:50.185
- 'Cause you've not your typical white bred American...
- Yeah. Absolutely.

14:50.187 --> 14:51.853
...but what you should do,

14:51.855 --> 14:54.556
is we want you to represent
women from all over the world.

14:54.558 --> 14:56.825
Strong women, clever women,

14:56.827 --> 14:58.227
intelligent women, right.

14:58.229 --> 15:00.063
- Creative women.
- You know, guys...

15:00.065 --> 15:02.665
I would say that, uh, as a, uh,

15:02.667 --> 15:05.969
- as a role model, kind of as a prototype for this character,
- Yeah.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.804
uh, for this movement,

15:07.806 --> 15:09.872
prototype of this movement
would be Beyonce Knowles.

15:09.874 --> 15:11.574
- Uh...
- Beyonce?

15:11.576 --> 15:15.877
Yes. Yes, I love her. Of course.

15:15.879 --> 15:17.012
I'm down, guys.

15:17.014 --> 15:18.082
I'm...

15:18.482 --> 15:19.949
Wow.

15:19.951 --> 15:21.850
Yes. I'm gonna be Beyonce.

15:54.219 --> 15:56.322
Where's my spoon? Where's
my spoon? Here we go.

16:24.816 --> 16:25.684
Hi.

16:26.183 --> 16:27.785
Oh, Tommy.

16:29.754 --> 16:30.820
For you.

16:30.822 --> 16:31.756
Oh.

16:33.091 --> 16:34.393
Do you miss this?

16:37.595 --> 16:38.697
Oh!

16:40.764 --> 16:41.631
All grown up, huh?

16:41.633 --> 16:43.299
And you look good.

16:43.301 --> 16:44.666
Come in here.

16:44.668 --> 16:46.502
You know what? We need to get
this open, is what we need to do.

16:46.504 --> 16:48.240
- It's not a twist though.
- Yeah.

16:50.841 --> 16:52.241
So, uh,

16:52.243 --> 16:53.512
you holding up, okay?

16:55.179 --> 16:56.647
- Sure. Yeah.
- Huh?

16:58.115 --> 16:59.617
- You're ready?
- I'm ready.

17:01.852 --> 17:03.421
- Really, I am.
- You know,

17:03.922 --> 17:05.121
I did everything.

17:05.123 --> 17:06.191
Okay.

17:11.694 --> 17:14.329
I did everything I could to
get that girl out with you.

17:14.332 --> 17:15.864
That darling girl.

17:15.866 --> 17:16.867
I know.

17:18.103 --> 17:19.938
She really helped you out.

17:23.875 --> 17:24.942
She did.

17:27.912 --> 17:28.913
Sure did.

17:32.851 --> 17:34.720
So, it goes, but...

17:36.587 --> 17:40.224
I am... really fucking sorry.

17:45.997 --> 17:47.830
So, I take it

17:47.832 --> 17:52.805
you didn't have an opportunity to watch
much reality television of you in Siberia.

17:53.904 --> 17:55.706
No.

17:56.807 --> 17:58.242
Mm, well,

17:59.144 --> 18:02.478
I regret to inform you that people still

18:02.480 --> 18:05.148
enjoy reality television.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.115
So, I gathered.

18:07.117 --> 18:08.753
Show no tip for you.

18:10.721 --> 18:15.461
An amalgamation of
America's top rated TV hosts.

18:16.493 --> 18:20.465
Now what you need to do is soak these in,

18:21.598 --> 18:25.934
and let it ooze back out
with your own stamp on it.

18:25.936 --> 18:29.471
You will be the new face of the
American intelligence community

18:29.473 --> 18:31.806
winning back the good graces

18:31.808 --> 18:33.479
of the American people.

18:34.211 --> 18:36.013
We're going to...

18:38.016 --> 18:40.549
send you on missions,

18:40.551 --> 18:43.054
and you're just gonna guide
us through your adventure.

18:46.523 --> 18:48.524
You really think folks gonna like me,

18:48.526 --> 18:51.561
root for me going around the world?

18:51.563 --> 18:53.499
Are you fucking kidding me?

18:59.938 --> 19:03.005
<i>We're preempting the Germans,</i>

19:03.007 --> 19:05.208
<i>hackers, whistle blowers.</i>

19:05.210 --> 19:06.808
<i>And we're no the only ones.</i>

19:08.011 --> 19:10.645
<i>England, France, Germany
have shows planned,</i>

19:10.647 --> 19:14.115
<i>and it won't be long before
China and Russia follow suit.</i>

19:14.117 --> 19:17.253
<i>And then we're gonna be
on a full-tilt arms race</i>

19:17.255 --> 19:21.090
<i>to see who can be most transparent</i>

19:21.092 --> 19:23.825
<i>about how secretive they are.</i>

19:23.827 --> 19:27.095
<i>And everybody is just
gonna have to learn to be</i>

19:27.097 --> 19:28.863
<i>okay with that shit,</i>

19:28.865 --> 19:32.034
<i>and realize that this is how nations</i>

19:32.036 --> 19:34.472
<i>maintain a stable world.</i>

19:35.038 --> 19:36.771
<i>And the alternative</i>

19:36.773 --> 19:39.741
<i>is that the whole world
just fucking nuke itself,</i>

19:39.743 --> 19:42.245
<i>and I don't even think the
Middle East wants to do that.</i>

19:42.247 --> 19:45.180
<i>So, rest up good,</i>

19:45.182 --> 19:47.385
<i>and pack your fucking things.</i>

19:48.452 --> 19:50.018
<i>Show time, Devlin.</i>

19:51.823 --> 19:55.891
<i>Rarely does the US government want
anyone more than it wanted this man,</i>

19:55.893 --> 19:58.193
<i>the worlds most
notorious arms dealer.</i>

19:58.195 --> 20:02.030
<i>...his army insurgent groups,
designated terrorist groups,</i>

20:02.032 --> 20:03.665
<i>Millions of dollars
worth of weapons...</i>

20:03.667 --> 20:05.801
<i>It has taken the
authority three years,</i>

20:05.803 --> 20:07.670
<i>but they finally have their target.</i>

20:07.672 --> 20:09.305
<i>He's known as the merchant of death.</i>

20:09.307 --> 20:11.507
<i>US saw him as a threat
because of his ability</i>

20:11.509 --> 20:14.043
<i>to arm terrorists targeting
the United States.</i>

20:14.045 --> 20:16.946
<i>...the scene of yesterday's
full terrorist bombing...</i>

20:16.948 --> 20:18.814
<i>...co-ordinated attacks
in one of the world's...</i>

20:18.816 --> 20:21.883
<i>Three deaths, 176 people
treated for injuries...</i>

20:21.885 --> 20:25.488
<i>ran into a busy train station and two
hotels and a popular restaurant...</i>

20:25.490 --> 20:27.657
<i>...with a knife in Paris.</i>

20:27.659 --> 20:29.057
<i>...Mumbai, India.</i>

20:29.059 --> 20:30.660
<i>More disturbing
report at a Belgium...</i>

20:30.662 --> 20:32.429
<i>This is World War 3.</i>

20:32.431 --> 20:35.965
<i>...devised a full undercover
operation to capture him.</i>

20:35.967 --> 20:37.703
<i>We've to take him out.</i>

21:36.693 --> 21:37.695
Okay.

21:39.997 --> 21:41.099
Okay.

21:42.333 --> 21:43.532
All right, excuse me.

21:43.534 --> 21:45.334
Let's see...

21:45.336 --> 21:47.836
if this puppy works.

21:47.838 --> 21:49.404
- Okay.
- Pull all the way up.

21:49.406 --> 21:50.574
No, no, no.

21:51.976 --> 21:53.342
I told you, it's all the way up.

21:53.344 --> 21:54.576
Can you please not touch my stuff?

21:54.578 --> 21:56.411
- I'm just saying.
- Can you please not touch...

21:56.413 --> 21:58.113
This is, this is my area.

21:58.115 --> 22:00.850
This is my department, this
is my region, all right?

22:00.852 --> 22:03.184
- You handle the...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:03.186 --> 22:05.523
Lo... It's hot.

22:14.632 --> 22:16.731
Thank you for helping get rid of him.

22:16.733 --> 22:18.867
Thank the American. It wasn't my idea.

22:23.007 --> 22:24.042
Okay.

22:27.178 --> 22:28.510
Mm.

22:28.512 --> 22:29.814
Do you think you'll ever regret it?

22:31.015 --> 22:32.248
Uh...

22:32.250 --> 22:33.349
It's fine with me.

22:35.586 --> 22:37.186
Oh, God, I love you.

22:37.188 --> 22:38.653
All right. Let's switch this.

22:38.655 --> 22:39.990
Yeah.

22:44.561 --> 22:47.095
Now, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.399
What the...

22:50.401 --> 22:52.334
Aah!

22:52.336 --> 22:53.572
I told you...

22:55.807 --> 22:56.805
Okay.

22:56.807 --> 22:59.044
A toast to the motherlands.

23:00.211 --> 23:01.242
Fuck Lebanon.

23:01.244 --> 23:02.510
Fuck China.

23:04.449 --> 23:05.683
What?

23:06.683 --> 23:08.551
You're never gonna see the reservation

23:08.553 --> 23:09.818
if you don't look through the smokes,

23:09.820 --> 23:10.986
<i>Thanks, Jesus.</i>

23:10.988 --> 23:11.953
Black Jesus.

23:11.955 --> 23:14.422
For amnesty, and reality TV.

23:17.327 --> 23:18.262
I'll tell you what?

23:20.530 --> 23:22.797
I've learned a thing or two... By the way,

23:22.799 --> 23:24.336
what are you doing with the control here?

23:25.303 --> 23:26.869
- Nothing.
- Well, I'm just...

23:26.871 --> 23:28.837
Yeah, exactly, nothing. We got
to stay eyes in the sky, baby.

23:28.839 --> 23:30.972
No, no, the eyes are
fine. My eyes are fine.

23:30.974 --> 23:33.441
Okay, our last night in Casablanca,

23:33.443 --> 23:34.410
what to do?

23:34.412 --> 23:37.182
Aw, what romantic notion.

23:38.215 --> 23:40.315
First eat your food.

23:40.317 --> 23:41.917
Then we fuck again?

23:41.919 --> 23:44.319
Oh, and go dancing.

23:44.321 --> 23:45.921
Yeah, yeah, perfect. Perfect!

23:45.923 --> 23:48.790
Um, I'd like to take one
last swim at the beach.

23:48.792 --> 23:51.896
I'd go with my father when I was
little and we'd find these conch shells.

23:54.932 --> 23:57.067
You know, that's the only
happy memory I have of him.

23:59.703 --> 24:03.008
I'd like to find us one last conch
shell, bring with us to India.

24:31.402 --> 24:33.134
Oh, God.

24:45.148 --> 24:47.583
- We're gonna find tons of guns.
- Good.

24:47.585 --> 24:49.017
You wanna just storm the place or what?

24:49.019 --> 24:51.120
What should we do? What's your plan?

24:51.122 --> 24:52.988
No, I'm not just gonna storm the place.

24:52.990 --> 24:56.292
You want me to just go in and start a
fire and say, "Hey, come smell the smoke"?

24:56.294 --> 24:59.460
Okay. Well, you're the war vet
here. I'm just the camera guy.

24:59.462 --> 25:00.898
Yellow or blue, don't hesitate.

25:01.365 --> 25:02.334
Green.

25:04.367 --> 25:05.534
Will you use it?

25:05.536 --> 25:06.936
No, we can't use it. Well...

25:06.938 --> 25:09.371
You got to find a way to
use that. That shit is good.

25:09.373 --> 25:10.940
- Well...
- I want that.

25:10.942 --> 25:12.607
Who do you think you work for?

25:16.380 --> 25:17.546
I'm gonna...

25:17.548 --> 25:19.817
Just in case someone is eavesdroping.

25:30.060 --> 25:32.460
Operation fine with me, the name...

25:32.462 --> 25:33.798
doesn't go far enough.

25:34.598 --> 25:35.797
What are you talking about?

25:35.799 --> 25:37.231
I'm saying that

25:37.233 --> 25:39.367
you should call it something like, uh,

25:39.369 --> 25:40.869
"Mission to Who Gives a Fuck."

25:40.871 --> 25:43.305
- What?
- You know what the CPI is?

25:43.307 --> 25:44.539
Chinese Pussy Investigator?

25:44.541 --> 25:45.809
No.

25:46.109 --> 25:47.008
No, man.

25:47.010 --> 25:48.911
Committee on Public Information.

25:48.913 --> 25:50.578
Woodrow Wilson, 1917.

25:50.580 --> 25:52.581
Movies had not even been invented yet,

25:52.583 --> 25:56.086
and the government was already using it to
make propaganda films for the 1st World War.

25:56.586 --> 25:58.187
Following me?

25:58.189 --> 26:01.289
You need to understand that
there's a context here, a history.

26:01.291 --> 26:02.624
Hollywood, my friend,

26:02.626 --> 26:05.326
has been in this business a very long time.

26:05.328 --> 26:06.498
What?

26:09.165 --> 26:12.700
The CIA financed George
Orwell's <i>Animal Farm.</i>

26:12.702 --> 26:15.603
You get into the kids heads
early, and they knew what it was.

26:15.605 --> 26:19.040
Anti Communism, the government
paid for it, teachers knew about it.

26:19.042 --> 26:20.875
Was there a public outcry? Of course not.

26:20.877 --> 26:24.013
Just call it a film class,
and teach it in public school.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.213
I don't understand what you're saying.

26:25.215 --> 26:26.481
This is what I'm trying to tell you,

26:26.483 --> 26:30.419
the consumers are the new weapon.

26:30.421 --> 26:32.821
Instead of having to...

26:32.823 --> 26:36.158
to get people to kind of,
you know, to coerce them,

26:36.160 --> 26:38.393
they want, they want to go there.

26:38.395 --> 26:40.528
All you got to do is give somebody
fucking something to watch,

26:40.530 --> 26:41.865
and then, just kind of...

29:04.607 --> 29:06.574
We're on HVT Iskandar Yasin.

29:06.576 --> 29:08.844
He's getting weapons to terrorists
and we're gonna find out why.

29:08.846 --> 29:12.280
We can monitor the situation at
real-time, and react as necessary.

29:12.282 --> 29:13.181
Yes, sir.

29:13.183 --> 29:14.682
So, who's tip is this on, anyway?

29:14.684 --> 29:18.056
A CO, Greenstreet back at SAD.

29:18.556 --> 29:19.688
Ah...

29:19.690 --> 29:21.824
Bounce around last few months,

29:21.826 --> 29:22.891
LA, Miami,

29:22.893 --> 29:24.596
New Orleans, San Fran...

29:26.564 --> 29:27.499
Ha.

29:28.898 --> 29:30.234
Those are all port towns.

29:30.733 --> 29:32.002
Yes, sir.

29:34.404 --> 29:35.804
I made two, one for me, one for you.

29:35.806 --> 29:37.642
I didn't mean for you to
eat both of our sandwiches.

29:38.474 --> 29:39.874
Thought you doubled up.

29:39.876 --> 29:41.678
No, Just... What have we got?

29:45.382 --> 29:46.317
Please.

29:46.683 --> 29:47.719
Please.

29:50.887 --> 29:52.854
<i>May I bring you a drink?</i>

29:53.790 --> 29:55.058
Ginger-ale if you have.

29:58.328 --> 30:00.929
I know the good places around here.

30:00.931 --> 30:02.965
Tomorrow we can have a walk,

30:02.967 --> 30:04.365
<i>have some steaks.</i>

30:04.367 --> 30:05.702
<i>Fine. Fine, thank you.</i>

30:13.143 --> 30:14.645
<i>So, your travels have been good?</i>

30:15.346 --> 30:16.577
Fine.

30:16.579 --> 30:18.113
And so,

30:18.115 --> 30:19.550
<i>everything's well with you?</i>

30:20.817 --> 30:22.052
<i>Yes.</i>

30:30.260 --> 30:31.195
Iskandar,

30:31.996 --> 30:33.362
what are you doing?

30:50.047 --> 30:51.249
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

30:51.714 --> 30:52.683
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

30:54.151 --> 30:56.653
<i>This tiny little fuck.</i>

31:17.407 --> 31:18.809
It was the way he said it...

31:20.109 --> 31:21.812
- He got me.
- Here's what I can tell you.

31:24.381 --> 31:25.514
In '89

31:25.516 --> 31:28.517
Colin Powell coined "Operation Just Cause,"

31:28.519 --> 31:31.553
when we wanted to
re-take the Panama Canal.

31:31.555 --> 31:34.659
The idea being, that if
anybody heard about it,

31:35.526 --> 31:38.296
other countries, media, whomever,

31:39.363 --> 31:42.400
they have to refer to our actions as a...

31:43.433 --> 31:44.432
Just Cause,

31:44.434 --> 31:46.738
even if they despise us.

31:47.871 --> 31:49.203
So,

31:49.205 --> 31:50.674
fine with me.

31:52.576 --> 31:53.711
Same idea.

31:55.945 --> 31:59.280
I can't give you many details

31:59.282 --> 32:02.217
at this stage, unfortunately,
but suffice to say,

32:02.219 --> 32:03.788
we do have something running.

32:05.521 --> 32:08.556
And it is called, "Operation Fine With Me."

32:08.558 --> 32:13.428
The question is, "How did
Iskandar Yasin hear about it?"

32:13.430 --> 32:16.134
So, go all the way to Panama,

32:16.933 --> 32:18.435
see about an MSS line.

32:19.236 --> 32:20.672
Mention this one time.

32:23.307 --> 32:25.340
No further digging we can do from home?

32:25.342 --> 32:27.375
It's a letter, no.

32:27.377 --> 32:29.446
That's why Beijing uses fucking letters.

32:30.047 --> 32:32.213
Could not be a letter. Hm?

32:32.215 --> 32:34.418
Could be a... setup.

32:35.952 --> 32:38.786
Could be anything, or... nothing

32:38.788 --> 32:39.757
Get moving,

32:40.656 --> 32:41.858
find the letter.

32:43.027 --> 32:45.129
And scrub those two Fuck Socks.

32:51.101 --> 32:53.035
There's something else.

32:54.505 --> 32:56.904
You ever hear the name...

32:56.906 --> 32:59.210
Nikos Papalexopoulous?

33:24.968 --> 33:26.802
So, fresh off the boat here at Panama,

33:26.804 --> 33:29.304
and hot at the heels of
Nikos Papalexopoulous,

33:29.306 --> 33:32.106
the shipping billionaire
fingered by Iskandar Yasin.

33:32.108 --> 33:33.275
You're mapping us, right, Seb?

33:33.277 --> 33:34.276
Yes, sir.

33:34.278 --> 33:35.376
All right, cool.

33:35.378 --> 33:36.777
All right, anyways,

33:36.779 --> 33:39.081
Nikos had apparently been
raving about a Chinese conspiracy

33:39.083 --> 33:40.681
to sabotage Panama Canal,

33:40.683 --> 33:42.619
replace it with their own trade route.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.254
Now, most executives
in the shipping biz say,

33:46.256 --> 33:47.956
this is a crazy-nonsensical idea

33:47.958 --> 33:51.295
that Nikos is just an
excitable, paranoid kind of guy.

33:55.465 --> 33:57.534
But we're following the lead, just in case.

34:08.878 --> 34:10.612
What else is in this file, Tommy?

34:10.614 --> 34:15.349
Well, the file says Mr. Papalexopoulous
is a hell of a businessman.

34:15.351 --> 34:20.222
How and why he find himself allegedly
in possession of a Beijing cable,

34:20.224 --> 34:22.858
Iskandar Yasin remain very much a mystery.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.226
But, hey, that's what
we're here to suss out

34:25.228 --> 34:27.460
Haven't you known, he
might want to try it again.

34:27.463 --> 34:29.530
- I'll try.
- This time more accurately, more angled.

34:29.532 --> 34:31.632
Just take your foot off the gas pedal.

34:31.635 --> 34:34.202
This is your first time,
it's your first bait.

34:34.204 --> 34:35.737
I know, I'm just trying things.

34:35.739 --> 34:36.570
I get it. I get it.

34:36.572 --> 34:38.039
They tell me you jump off the cliff...

34:38.041 --> 34:39.744
No, we don't jump off the cliff.

35:02.498 --> 35:04.566
I'd say, just a suggestion...

35:04.568 --> 35:06.233
- Yeah?
- Let's try it again.

35:06.235 --> 35:08.003
- Okay.
- You don't have a parachute on, don't jump off the cliff.

35:08.005 --> 35:09.204
I'll grow wings on the way down.

35:09.206 --> 35:10.608
Oh, fine. Grow your wings.

35:16.179 --> 35:18.179
<i>I have in my possession this</i>

35:18.181 --> 35:20.148
classified...

35:20.150 --> 35:24.653
political communique between the Chinese
Ministry of State Security and the chairman of

35:24.655 --> 35:27.923
<i>China's leading
shipping conglomerate.</i>

35:27.925 --> 35:31.425
<i>The previous owner of this
document was Iskandar Yasin.</i>

35:31.427 --> 35:33.128
<i>I have no idea how he obtained it,</i>

35:33.130 --> 35:34.563
- <i>but he, he...</i>
- <i>Iskandar?</i>

35:34.565 --> 35:36.463
<i>Yes, he sold it to me illegally,</i>

35:36.465 --> 35:40.568
<i>promising that it would benefit my
company's interest in the canal.</i>

35:40.570 --> 35:42.503
<i>This Beijing document.</i>

35:42.505 --> 35:45.773
<i>Details of deal between
China and Columbia</i>

35:45.775 --> 35:49.010
<i>to build a high-speed rail
link across South America.</i>

35:49.012 --> 35:50.512
<i>For the next step</i>

35:50.514 --> 35:55.050
for the enemies of the west is an
all-out direct attack on this canal.

35:55.052 --> 35:57.219
This would sever our artery and,

35:57.221 --> 36:00.054
<i>elevate China to an unrivaled</i>

36:00.056 --> 36:03.391
position of trade dominance!

36:03.393 --> 36:05.392
- Dominance.
- Trade dominance.

36:05.394 --> 36:07.632
Dominance, yes.

36:12.969 --> 36:14.004
Dominance.

36:15.105 --> 36:16.838
<i>Who are you?</i>

36:20.811 --> 36:21.744
<i>Who are you?</i>

36:21.746 --> 36:24.012
What are you doing here?
How did you find me?

36:25.148 --> 36:26.651
<i>Stop playing games at me.</i>

36:27.050 --> 36:28.619
Games, huh?

36:33.523 --> 36:34.825
Fuck!

36:41.364 --> 36:43.898
Hang on a bit. What do you think
about maybe say the tag line?

36:43.900 --> 36:45.666
I mean, that's what
we're here to suss out...

36:45.668 --> 36:47.969
- No that's the lead.
- Well, what the fuck's a tag line?

36:47.971 --> 36:48.737
Swamp Fox down.

36:48.739 --> 36:50.271
Wait, what?

36:50.273 --> 36:52.240
That's your code name
on the show, Swamp Fox.

36:52.242 --> 36:53.474
I would not have agreed.

36:53.476 --> 36:54.575
Did you read the notes?

36:54.577 --> 36:55.809
I've didn't read any of the notes.

36:55.811 --> 36:57.045
Don't you read any of the notes?

36:59.148 --> 37:00.648
I mean, I flipped them through.

37:00.650 --> 37:02.483
Look, don't be a demon, just do it, okay?

37:02.485 --> 37:04.119
- Okay.
- All right.

37:06.088 --> 37:07.088
Swamp Fox down.

37:21.538 --> 37:22.840
Some one rode on her, all right.

37:23.239 --> 37:24.305
Yeah.

37:24.307 --> 37:25.373
All right, so what you wanna...

37:25.375 --> 37:26.708
What do you want to do with her, huh?

37:26.710 --> 37:27.941
Black bag.

37:27.943 --> 37:32.447
Let's see what she know about Mr. Papa

37:32.449 --> 37:34.885
Ah, yes. Swamp Fox means business.

37:36.219 --> 37:37.217
Come on.

37:37.219 --> 37:38.452
Upsy daisies.

37:47.898 --> 37:48.963
<i>Who sent you here?</i>

37:48.965 --> 37:50.398
Tell me what you know.

37:50.400 --> 37:52.800
Now, Mr. Papalexopoulous,

37:52.802 --> 37:55.670
while you're at it, what about that...

37:55.672 --> 37:58.141
Get your hand off my face.
I'm doing the questions.

38:10.420 --> 38:12.387
<i>All right. Bravo, huh.</i>

38:12.389 --> 38:14.525
<i>Hey, that's a good job now.</i>

38:15.592 --> 38:18.559
I spoke with the producer
last week and he gave me

38:18.561 --> 38:23.498
really constructive notes, and directions

38:23.500 --> 38:25.333
to how to play going forward.

38:25.335 --> 38:26.834
Can you take this bag off my head?

38:26.836 --> 38:28.135
Oh.

38:28.137 --> 38:29.072
Right. Sorry.

38:32.675 --> 38:34.244
I need to go to the hotel

38:35.211 --> 38:36.547
to start drinking.

38:37.981 --> 38:39.884
Until the next time...

38:41.351 --> 38:42.586
Till next time, huh?

38:43.920 --> 38:44.822
One in the can.

38:46.222 --> 38:48.123
What the hell was that, man?

38:48.125 --> 38:49.724
So, let me get this straight.

38:49.726 --> 38:50.925
They've got you finishing,

38:50.927 --> 38:52.659
while you actors playing my Yulia

38:52.661 --> 38:54.496
on a god damn French journalist?

38:54.498 --> 38:56.998
What the kind of son of a bitch hair
brain bull shit they're trying to pull?

39:05.708 --> 39:07.675
<i>The latest,</i>

39:07.677 --> 39:10.912
<i>has been reported that the US troops have
arrived in the vicinity in Panama City.</i>

39:10.914 --> 39:14.749
<i>Authorities say that Columbia's
largest rebel group the FARC has...</i>

39:14.751 --> 39:18.887
<i>...as Columbia resumes air
strikes after Fox surprise attack.</i>

39:18.889 --> 39:21.555
<i>The president has directed
United States forces...</i>

39:22.559 --> 39:24.691
<i>...to execute mission to Panama</i>

39:24.693 --> 39:27.695
<i>to protect the integrity
of the Panama Canal...</i>

39:35.639 --> 39:37.304
<i>The latest developments
fails to derail</i>

39:37.306 --> 39:39.907
<i>the peace talks between the
Columbian government and the...</i>

39:51.320 --> 39:53.320
<i>Under these circumstances</i>

39:53.322 --> 39:56.858
<i>the president decided he must
act to prevent further violence.</i>

39:56.860 --> 40:00.094
He's taken...

40:20.516 --> 40:21.715
<i>And boom.</i>

40:21.717 --> 40:23.952
<i>Just like that, we had
precedent to come in,</i>

40:23.954 --> 40:26.220
<i>and put the canal right
back under our thumb,</i>

40:26.222 --> 40:28.889
<i>like the good old days
under Teddy Roosevelt.</i>

40:32.228 --> 40:35.697
<i>Our surveillance videos of Nikos
were conveniently leaked to the press</i>

40:35.699 --> 40:39.501
<i>sounding the alarm on China's
aggressive intentions on the region.</i>

40:39.503 --> 40:43.905
<i>Add to that two CIA agents
being blown half to death</i>

40:43.907 --> 40:45.974
<i>by a flamboyant Columbian terrorist,</i>

40:45.976 --> 40:48.842
<i>and no one at home watching
would argue the need</i>

40:48.844 --> 40:52.112
<i>for us to move in to
protect global commerce.</i>

41:01.023 --> 41:02.958
<i>We had to give the
story runners credit.</i>

41:02.960 --> 41:07.561
<i>They constructed a narrative that had the
world dancing like puppets on strings.</i>

41:52.342 --> 41:54.677
Sweet miracle.

41:55.545 --> 41:57.010
Where are we?

41:57.012 --> 41:59.414
Panama, Chief of Station's house.

41:59.416 --> 42:00.347
Gave us the night,

42:00.349 --> 42:02.849
you lucky fucking devils.

42:02.851 --> 42:04.184
It was Jacobo Rios.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.155
Yeah, I know.

42:07.257 --> 42:08.759
We reviewed the footage,

42:09.358 --> 42:10.592
and I'm sorry to say,

42:10.594 --> 42:13.860
we let that two bit, Neanderthal
cunt slip right past us

42:13.862 --> 42:16.799
out of Panama, across
the border into Columbia.

42:17.233 --> 42:18.365
Thank you.

42:18.367 --> 42:20.136
I usually like a slippery cunt.

42:21.538 --> 42:24.738
You know, uh, I don't know
if your medics would approve,

42:24.740 --> 42:29.746
but how would you boys feel
about a bloody Mary on the patio?

42:30.947 --> 42:32.916
Don't have to twist my arms backward.

42:37.253 --> 42:40.921
For starters, this whole situation
is as fucked up as a football bet

42:40.923 --> 42:43.157
we don't have very long bet from it.

42:43.159 --> 42:45.226
It wasn't an hour...

42:45.228 --> 42:48.662
...after that bomb went off that
Panama, I had Washington on the phone

42:48.664 --> 42:51.633
begging us to come in and defend the canal.

42:51.635 --> 42:54.038
And if this waterway gets blitzed,

42:56.706 --> 42:58.041
you hurt Nikos.

42:59.643 --> 43:01.008
So, what's the game plan, Syd?

43:01.010 --> 43:03.577
I want you to hunt down Rios and Yasin,

43:03.579 --> 43:08.349
but retaking of the canal will be
handled long-haul diplomatically.

43:08.351 --> 43:09.816
I know it's shit

43:09.818 --> 43:14.021
circumstances were to come back to
our team, but whoop, there it is.

43:14.023 --> 43:17.492
Syd, what the hell have we been
showing people here anyways?

43:17.494 --> 43:18.892
We are writing,

43:18.894 --> 43:22.929
and directing reality and
the world will live in it.

43:22.931 --> 43:25.335
This is no different than
what we've been doing.

43:26.001 --> 43:27.434
Eighteen months between

43:27.436 --> 43:31.074
<i>Operation Neptune Spear</i>
and <i>Zero Dark Thirty.</i>

43:31.840 --> 43:33.675
All we're doing now

43:33.677 --> 43:35.543
is shortening the window

43:35.545 --> 43:38.048
for the day and the date release.

43:41.483 --> 43:42.485
Syd...

43:44.621 --> 43:46.155
It's ridiculous.

43:50.726 --> 43:51.862
Oh, God.

43:53.463 --> 43:54.465
You know...

43:55.931 --> 43:57.266
I don't think

43:58.568 --> 44:00.471
you boys fully grasp

44:01.938 --> 44:04.041
the paradigm shift we are in.

44:05.007 --> 44:08.608
If China were to experience some

44:08.610 --> 44:12.146
unforeseen technical hiccup,

44:12.148 --> 44:17.918
a catastrophic act of god
across that construction site...

44:17.920 --> 44:22.956
Then I suppose that you want us
to keep filming, right? Everything.

44:22.958 --> 44:24.458
Absolutely.

44:24.460 --> 44:26.327
Oh, no, no. I'm done with that shit.

44:26.329 --> 44:28.599
It's too bad. You signed a contract.

45:26.889 --> 45:28.357
What are we even doing here, man?

45:30.193 --> 45:32.392
How far are the god damn excavation site?

45:32.394 --> 45:33.760
To what? The high-speed rail?

45:33.762 --> 45:35.329
Yes, the god damn excavation site,

45:35.331 --> 45:36.998
for the god-damn Chinese rail.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.666
I don't know, about 20 clicks.

45:38.668 --> 45:40.034
20 clicks?

45:40.036 --> 45:42.003
They couldn't drop us any closer?

45:42.005 --> 45:45.807
No, man, they wanted the audience to go
on a journey, all right? More bonded time.

45:45.809 --> 45:48.041
Pretty nature, all right. So just enjoy it.

45:48.043 --> 45:49.142
Fuck.

45:49.144 --> 45:50.278
They gave us...

45:50.280 --> 45:52.079
Fox tail on your head their idea?

45:52.081 --> 45:53.414
What the fuck do you think?

45:53.416 --> 45:55.682
Oh, no, all right, man,
just giving you a hard time.

45:58.054 --> 45:59.353
Oh, knee pads too, huh?

45:59.355 --> 46:01.289
The knee pads they're my choice, okay?

46:01.291 --> 46:03.958
You ever lie on sniper
stakeout for 72 hours, Seb?

46:03.960 --> 46:06.126
I didn't think so. You want knee pads.

46:06.128 --> 46:08.195
Yeah, fair enough, Swamp Fox, fair enough.

46:08.197 --> 46:10.664
I'd refer to you on the military matters.

46:10.666 --> 46:13.266
How much shit you reckon they laid
out for us to get through, anyways?

46:13.268 --> 46:15.101
Hell, I don't know, if I had to guess,

46:15.103 --> 46:17.405
maybe a sniper or two,
it shouldn't be too bad,

46:17.407 --> 46:19.072
they can't kill the lead
characters after all.

46:19.074 --> 46:21.208
Stay close, keep a good look out.

46:21.210 --> 46:22.445
Yeah, I got you.

46:22.811 --> 46:24.080
Holy shit.

46:24.847 --> 46:26.514
What the hell is that?

46:26.516 --> 46:27.617
Oh, shit.

46:30.353 --> 46:31.722
Watch that fucking step.

46:44.132 --> 46:46.068
Let's setup camp here for the night.

47:02.518 --> 47:03.487
Hi.

47:07.056 --> 47:09.523
You scared the crap out of me.

47:09.525 --> 47:12.061
I'm sorry, no one answered the door.

47:12.327 --> 47:14.195
Oh.

47:14.197 --> 47:16.365
I didn't know you had such a green thumb.

47:19.168 --> 47:20.336
Oh, it's done.

47:22.538 --> 47:24.137
Get you some tea?

47:24.139 --> 47:25.708
That would be lovely, thank you.

47:26.576 --> 47:27.510
Come on.

47:28.610 --> 47:29.677
So?

47:29.679 --> 47:32.045
Yeah, it has been in the
family for generations.

47:32.047 --> 47:33.780
Wow. It's really beautiful.

47:33.782 --> 47:37.017
I try to keep it exactly the
way my grandmother loved it.

47:37.019 --> 47:39.422
Oh, it looks like it. Yeah.

47:40.556 --> 47:43.023
So, what's so foot that you didn't call?

47:43.025 --> 47:44.191
Oh, it...

47:44.193 --> 47:46.594
It's not a big deal. I hope.

47:46.596 --> 47:49.465
There's just something we
need to discuss about the show.

47:50.065 --> 47:51.400
About your role in it.

47:55.304 --> 47:57.604
Well, get on with it, wet puss.

48:02.978 --> 48:04.480
Uh...

48:07.550 --> 48:10.117
Look, ratings are down, and we think

48:10.119 --> 48:12.286
it's because of your character.

48:12.288 --> 48:15.488
I'm sorry, it's just not a
terribly easy thing to say,

48:15.490 --> 48:17.224
and I don't want you to be insulted.

48:17.226 --> 48:19.262
Oh, I've a thick skin.

48:20.929 --> 48:21.996
Get on with it.

48:21.998 --> 48:24.434
All right. Well, bluntly...

48:25.201 --> 48:27.133
We need you to change.

48:27.135 --> 48:30.503
Yeah, the
cuddly-old-mentor thing,

48:30.505 --> 48:32.039
it's a bit tired.

48:32.041 --> 48:34.177
We need more conflict for Thomas.

48:35.978 --> 48:37.244
What the fuck you talking about?

48:37.246 --> 48:38.445
It would be more dramatically

48:38.447 --> 48:40.947
interesting for the
show if you evolved into

48:40.949 --> 48:43.483
a shady-sinister kind of mentor.

48:43.485 --> 48:46.155
You know, some one with their
own agenda who can't be trusted.

48:47.724 --> 48:48.755
But, that's not me.

48:48.757 --> 48:50.590
I'd never do that.

48:50.592 --> 48:52.126
Well, you will, now.

48:52.128 --> 48:54.394
In popular shows, that's what you do.

48:54.396 --> 48:57.565
You change due to some
curve ball circumstance.

48:57.567 --> 48:59.235
It's what's best for the show.

49:23.492 --> 49:24.561
Keep down!

49:25.561 --> 49:26.961
My fucking leg!

50:02.565 --> 50:04.030
All right, Syd, I'm gonna go for it.

50:04.032 --> 50:05.398
<i>We'd like to have them start taking</i>

50:05.400 --> 50:07.200
Instagrams of all their kills.

50:07.202 --> 50:10.037
Just tell them that we'll post
them in the run-up to the premier

50:10.039 --> 50:12.106
and during the commercial
breaks, all right.

50:12.108 --> 50:13.744
Tell them we said, uh...

50:14.342 --> 50:16.209
Good luck, Swamp Fox.

50:16.211 --> 50:17.378
Adi Shankar...

50:17.380 --> 50:19.412
What's the deal with him. Is it Adi or Adi?

50:19.414 --> 50:21.682
Adi, Adi, I don't know.

50:21.684 --> 50:24.985
It's his obsession with
Kiss, so, uh, what is...

50:24.987 --> 50:26.586
What's with the star...

50:26.588 --> 50:29.123
You know what? It's
Hollywood at its very worst.

50:29.125 --> 50:30.124
That's what it is.

50:37.833 --> 50:38.969
Are you on Tinder right now?

50:40.068 --> 50:41.568
What Tinder?

50:41.570 --> 50:43.137
I'm just saying that you're
swiping right on your phone,

50:43.139 --> 50:44.804
I just don't know what you're...

50:44.806 --> 50:45.873
I am fine.

50:45.875 --> 50:47.541
- I'm just saying...
- It's between me and you.

50:47.543 --> 50:49.142
You want to get all
freaky deaky that's fine,

50:49.144 --> 50:51.144
I'm just saying that I just
don't trust social media sites.

50:51.146 --> 50:53.349
Look. Look, I got it all on camera.

50:53.849 --> 50:55.351
Oh, no! Stop it!

50:55.818 --> 50:56.983
Stop it.

50:56.985 --> 50:59.052
- You ought to see it.
- Are you blushing, Syd?

50:59.054 --> 51:00.389
- Are you blushing?
- What?

51:01.389 --> 51:02.792
Syd, I just got to say it...

51:04.059 --> 51:05.258
You look lovely today.

51:05.260 --> 51:06.693
- You do look lovely.
- You do.

51:06.695 --> 51:07.661
You do look lovely.

51:07.663 --> 51:08.394
Going overboard.

51:08.396 --> 51:09.996
No, no, no.

51:09.998 --> 51:11.532
I'm your boss, and your elder,

51:11.534 --> 51:12.999
and you got to respect me.

51:13.001 --> 51:14.467
I can't hear all of that...

51:14.469 --> 51:15.568
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

51:15.570 --> 51:17.137
- Respect.
- We go back.

51:17.139 --> 51:18.472
- Respect.
- Yes, ma'am.

51:18.474 --> 51:20.074
And look who cut loose with that raid

51:20.076 --> 51:21.842
down Bogota? I saw you.

51:21.844 --> 51:22.943
Hey.

51:22.945 --> 51:24.244
- You're like a...
- Hey.

51:24.246 --> 51:25.414
- ball of...
- Hey!

51:28.150 --> 51:29.349
All love stance.

51:29.351 --> 51:31.117
She didn't dance, but she...

51:31.119 --> 51:33.757
What ever happened to

51:35.557 --> 51:37.490
- I smell something.
- Don't fuck with me.

51:37.492 --> 51:39.526
Say, what do we do when
we come across Iskandar?

51:39.528 --> 51:42.195
I want you to take that sad nigga,

51:42.197 --> 51:44.264
and blow his brains out.

51:44.266 --> 51:46.233
He's playing both sides against the middle,

51:46.235 --> 51:47.367
I don't like it.

51:47.369 --> 51:49.369
We don't know who's side he's on,

51:49.371 --> 51:51.005
or whether he's independent.

51:51.007 --> 51:54.340
And I really think he's
fucking that chick Valeria.

51:54.342 --> 51:56.075
Well, I know, I know he is.

51:56.077 --> 51:57.878
He must've put a shovel in...

51:57.880 --> 51:59.313
Anyways,

51:59.315 --> 52:00.947
I talked to Paul,

52:00.949 --> 52:02.550
- Yeah?
- over JSOC

52:02.552 --> 52:06.119
and he wanted to give you a heads up.

52:06.121 --> 52:10.291
There maybe a few of those blue
helmeted queens from UN so, look out.

52:10.293 --> 52:11.325
Smurfs?

52:11.327 --> 52:12.429
Got it.

52:12.994 --> 52:14.360
Anything else?

52:14.362 --> 52:17.666
Yes. As per skinny bitch Elizabeth,

52:18.733 --> 52:20.636
but you're not gonna like it.

52:22.170 --> 52:23.336
Please,

52:23.338 --> 52:26.476
try to read the character notes this time.

52:27.876 --> 52:28.911
And, you know...

52:29.679 --> 52:30.411
amp it up

52:30.413 --> 52:31.847
for the fly over strings.

52:33.215 --> 52:34.414
Let's see what we got here.

52:34.416 --> 52:36.749
More banter. You two are a buddy team.

52:36.751 --> 52:38.219
Lay off, Thomas.

52:38.221 --> 52:43.224
You're in a new world, Sebastian.
You're who the audience relates to.

52:43.226 --> 52:44.858
Yeah, I'll read them.

52:44.860 --> 52:46.062
Just fucking words.

52:47.096 --> 52:48.628
I got you. No, I got you.

52:48.630 --> 52:50.197
Well, I'll read them.

52:55.838 --> 52:58.472
<i>Sorry, Panama Canal. There's
a new girl on the block.</i>

52:58.474 --> 53:03.110
<i>And these amazing story
happens in Latin America.</i>

53:03.112 --> 53:05.144
<i>It's not a bird or a plane,</i>

53:05.146 --> 53:06.679
<i>it's a train.</i>

53:06.681 --> 53:08.182
<i>The next great Chinese
infrastructure project...</i>

53:08.184 --> 53:10.316
<i>...a really fast,
really expensive train.</i>

53:10.318 --> 53:13.954
<i>...as Trans Continental Railroad
connecting the Pacific and...</i>

53:13.956 --> 53:15.755
<i>China announced the deal Thursday</i>

53:15.757 --> 53:18.992
<i>to build a 12.7 billion

53:18.994 --> 53:24.130
<i>Panama Canal could be soon facing
competition as we mentioned earlier...</i>

53:24.132 --> 53:25.766
<i>...to establish</i>

53:25.768 --> 53:27.700
<i>a more visible footprint
for China in the region.</i>

53:27.702 --> 53:31.505
<i>It's going to boost trade,
transportation, communication, people...</i>

53:31.507 --> 53:35.275
<i>Latin America is traditionally
within the US spearhead,</i>

53:35.277 --> 53:39.979
<i>Will China's investment change the
dynamics of US and Latin American relation?</i>

53:39.981 --> 53:42.818
<i>Therein lies the problem
for the United States.</i>

54:03.639 --> 54:06.139
<i>Adi, Elizabeth and
myself are going to...</i>

54:06.141 --> 54:08.976
<i>You will be the new face

- <i>It's show time.</i>

54:10.746 --> 54:12.579
<i>We're on HVT Iskandar Yasin.</i>

54:12.581 --> 54:14.313
<i>I just lost an MSS Communique.</i>

54:14.315 --> 54:16.950
<i>political communique between the

54:21.690 --> 54:23.192
- <i>Bonsoir.</i>
- <i>Cripple that railway.</i>

54:23.858 --> 54:25.258
Up ahead.

54:25.260 --> 54:27.193
Approaching the railway.

54:27.195 --> 54:29.932
China's about to break grounds
on these high-speed rails.

54:32.068 --> 54:36.503
Reds using highly sought after
proprietary tech on this thing.

54:36.505 --> 54:38.539
One of our objectives, nab that tech.

54:38.541 --> 54:42.045
So we can see if there's cost effective way
to apply to our own domestic infrastructure.

54:44.179 --> 54:48.949
There's going to be a vintage brain
drain decapitation head strike.

54:48.951 --> 54:51.017
Tactically operative blow up assignment

54:51.019 --> 54:53.354
when folks start working
for the wrong team.

54:53.356 --> 54:57.825
Now, if these froggies were Jerry's,

54:57.827 --> 55:00.360
we might be able to turn
them with a little coercion,

55:00.362 --> 55:02.595
but, uh, industrial Chinamen...

55:02.597 --> 55:05.298
they are horse of a different color.

55:05.300 --> 55:07.603
Can't be turned. Got to be put down.

55:08.137 --> 55:10.170
Say, assets here.

55:10.172 --> 55:12.840
Okay. So, any words

55:12.842 --> 55:15.711
for those who might be frightened
about what you're about to do?

55:17.980 --> 55:19.179
Yeah.

55:19.181 --> 55:20.947
We're on a damn street fight.

55:20.949 --> 55:23.217
We aim to be the best at it.

55:23.219 --> 55:24.987
You think isolation isn't works?

55:26.322 --> 55:27.856
Read the damn history book.

55:30.025 --> 55:31.291
Go ahead. Take your time.

55:31.293 --> 55:32.628
Oh, my God.

55:33.295 --> 55:34.661
Two clicks off.

55:48.978 --> 55:51.012
Let me show you some
more paper work inside.

55:54.083 --> 55:55.682
In the cross hair. Baby, tell me when.

55:55.684 --> 55:57.351
I should have brought champagne.

55:57.353 --> 55:58.351
After the inspection.

55:58.353 --> 55:59.452
Oh! Of course...

55:59.454 --> 56:00.824
Okay, to it.

56:10.900 --> 56:13.400
We're not Americans. Lower your weapons.

56:17.472 --> 56:19.238
We're not Americans.

56:52.507 --> 56:53.574
Shit!

57:05.788 --> 57:07.090
Come on!

57:16.798 --> 57:18.201
Come on!

57:20.101 --> 57:21.635
Oh, my God, here they come. Here they come.

57:21.637 --> 57:22.939
Start clapping.

57:27.543 --> 57:29.709
Movie stars, you two. Movie stars.

57:29.711 --> 57:31.010
Morning, all.

57:31.012 --> 57:32.045
Kills go down all the time,

57:32.047 --> 57:33.713
but the way those kills went down,

57:33.715 --> 57:34.882
we are literally gonna have

57:34.884 --> 57:37.150
viewers waving flags all over the streets.

57:37.152 --> 57:39.786
Land mine GIFs are already trending hard.

57:39.788 --> 57:40.854
- Mm-mm.
- Already.

57:40.856 --> 57:43.990
Great to hear. Like a... proud papa.

57:43.992 --> 57:46.094
We was gonna say, "I'm done."

57:47.061 --> 57:48.028
What?

57:48.030 --> 57:49.262
I'm out.

57:49.264 --> 57:51.164
- What?
- I'm out.

57:51.166 --> 57:53.333
- Done.
- Excuse me, would you mind...

57:53.335 --> 57:55.802
pulling the condom off
your tongue and repeating?

57:55.804 --> 57:57.271
Let me guess, Syd,

57:57.273 --> 58:00.807
next thing you want me to
do is go down Casablanca,

58:00.809 --> 58:02.409
and kill Iskandar Yasin.

58:02.411 --> 58:03.709
Is that right?

58:03.711 --> 58:05.914
Fuck that, okay. You can find someone else.

58:07.282 --> 58:08.815
Swamp Fox,

58:08.817 --> 58:12.586
if it helps you think about your
characters motivation in movie terms,

58:12.588 --> 58:14.588
you're like the blob.

58:14.590 --> 58:16.389
The movie <i>The Blob,</i> you remember?

58:16.391 --> 58:19.828
You're an amorphous killer that is
constantly adapting to your environment.

58:20.795 --> 58:23.229
Uh, who the fuck is this guy?

58:23.231 --> 58:27.133
Thomas, we need to re-focus big picture.

58:27.135 --> 58:29.836
The Panama Canal is back
under our stewardship

58:29.838 --> 58:33.072
to the tune of a trillion
new tax dollars per year.

58:33.074 --> 58:34.874
- Wow.
- That's because of you.

58:34.876 --> 58:37.209
Like I said, I'm out.

58:37.211 --> 58:40.246
You all gonna have to come up with
a whole batch of new wonderful lies.

58:40.248 --> 58:41.048
- Look, guys.
- What!

58:41.050 --> 58:42.950
Look. Hey, look, Thomas is done.

58:42.952 --> 58:44.351
- Did he smoke?
- All right?

58:44.353 --> 58:46.086
You want Iskandar Yasin,
I'll go get him my damn self.

58:46.088 --> 58:47.720
Hey, Sebastian.

58:47.722 --> 58:50.190
Could you do me and everyone else here
a favor and shut the fuck up. All right?

58:50.192 --> 58:51.525
You are the sidekick. You are...

58:51.527 --> 58:54.360
Adi, be cool.

58:54.362 --> 58:58.268

something that might change your mind.

01:05:52.246 --> 01:05:53.815
I'm going to save her.

01:05:54.449 --> 01:05:55.414
Uh-hm.

01:05:55.416 --> 01:05:57.751
Fuck you, man! Fuck you and your red book.

01:05:57.753 --> 01:06:00.387
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:01.954
- Cut this...
- This is very intense for you.

01:06:01.956 --> 01:06:04.192
- What time's our flight?
- Thirty minutes.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.195
I'll fucking cut you!

01:06:07.695 --> 01:06:08.795
Chill. Relax.

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:11.197
Shit I've been through,
fucking Seb, fuck that!

01:06:11.199 --> 01:06:13.168
Relax. Forget that guy, all right?

01:06:15.336 --> 01:06:17.137
- What time's our flight?
- Thirty minutes.

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.972
Now, listen,

01:06:18.974 --> 01:06:22.708
on this Op, we'd like you to take a
few pages out of the Castro playbook...

01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:24.344
Oh! Castro playbook.

01:06:24.346 --> 01:06:26.079
Jesus Christ. Wants us to
use the Castro playbook.

01:06:26.081 --> 01:06:28.947
- Not the Castro playbook?
- Take out the pages of the Castro playbook.

01:06:28.949 --> 01:06:30.150
I don't know, I have some reservations

01:06:30.152 --> 01:06:31.450
about the Castro playbook.

01:06:31.452 --> 01:06:33.186
- You got reservations,
- Castro playbook.

01:06:33.188 --> 01:06:35.188
- I got reservations.
- Well, I then reservations about the Castro playbook,

01:06:35.190 --> 01:06:36.856
because it is the Castro playbook.

01:06:36.858 --> 01:06:39.628
What the fuck of the playbook?
Get your asses out of here.

01:06:42.931 --> 01:06:43.996
I'm taking this.

01:06:46.034 --> 01:06:47.403
I'll take one of these.

01:06:48.836 --> 01:06:49.836
Fuck you all.

01:06:49.838 --> 01:06:51.574
I told you, guys. Let him go.

01:06:52.706 --> 01:06:54.409
Seb, got you a cold one.

01:06:54.943 --> 01:06:57.043
Got you a cold one.

01:06:57.045 --> 01:06:58.813
We're going to Casablanca, my friend.

01:07:22.871 --> 01:07:25.438
Good evening, ladies and
gentleman, here we go.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.610
One last time into the bridge.

01:07:34.516 --> 01:07:36.148
<i>Now, for those of you
at home wondering that</i>

01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:38.418
<i>the Castro playbook is a dossier,</i>

01:07:38.420 --> 01:07:40.119
<i>it consists of several
hundred methods</i>

01:07:40.121 --> 01:07:43.658
<i>with which the CIA attempted
to assassinate Fidel Castro.</i>

01:07:44.525 --> 01:07:46.661
Yeah, shout it out Sebi Sebster.

01:07:47.128 --> 01:07:48.230
Shout it out.

01:07:49.998 --> 01:07:52.030
<i>Exploding cigars, poisoned pens,</i>

01:07:52.032 --> 01:07:53.233
<i>honey pots,</i>

01:07:53.235 --> 01:07:55.101
<i>lacing his radio studio with LSD,</i>

01:07:55.103 --> 01:07:57.936
<i>a diseased scuba suit along
with booby trapped shells</i>

01:07:57.938 --> 01:07:59.838
<i>as Fidel was an avid diver.</i>

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.673
<i>But you know what?</i>

01:08:00.675 --> 01:08:02.141
<i>That's all real stuff, okay.</i>

01:08:02.143 --> 01:08:04.043
<i>So if you think all
of this is silly,</i>

01:08:04.045 --> 01:08:05.380
<i>think again.</i>

01:09:27.962 --> 01:09:29.731
This... This is bull shit.

01:09:33.301 --> 01:09:35.667
This is bull shit! Bull shit!

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:38.506
Oh. You must focus and prepare.

01:09:44.377 --> 01:09:45.978
You were too smart for them.

01:09:45.979 --> 01:09:46.979
No, no.

01:09:46.981 --> 01:09:48.384
They were the smart one.

01:09:49.082 --> 01:09:50.417
I just got lucky.

01:09:51.353 --> 01:09:54.019
But, it was a great plan though, I admit.

01:09:55.523 --> 01:09:57.624
- They got back the Panama Canal,
- Uh-hm.

01:09:57.626 --> 01:10:00.927
and if, if any body has something
to say about it, they will say,

01:10:00.929 --> 01:10:02.762
"Huh? It's fine with me."

01:10:04.798 --> 01:10:05.632
Hmm.

01:10:05.634 --> 01:10:07.066
Race you to the beach?

01:10:25.020 --> 01:10:26.753
<i>They had been signed onto the show</i>

01:10:26.755 --> 01:10:30.690
<i>and given a storyline to fulfill
just like Swamp Fox and me.</i>

01:10:30.692 --> 01:10:33.293
<i>Only instead of being cast
from inside the agency,</i>

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:35.294
<i>they were cast to
one amnesty program</i>

01:10:35.296 --> 01:10:37.196
<i>setup by the show runners.</i>

01:10:37.198 --> 01:10:38.930
<i>Fugitives and refugees</i>

01:10:38.932 --> 01:10:41.401
<i>who have been captured
and were given a choice.</i>

01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:43.568
<i>Play the villains
in our reality show,</i>

01:10:43.570 --> 01:10:47.307
<i>or face a lifetime in
black site prisons.</i>

01:10:47.309 --> 01:10:50.610
<i>If they survived the show,
it was a path to freedom,</i>

01:10:50.612 --> 01:10:52.815
<i>in the witness protection program.</i>

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:55.315
<i>It made us sad.</i>

01:10:55.317 --> 01:10:57.282
<i>But Swamp Fox and me had no choice</i>

01:10:57.284 --> 01:10:58.886
<i>but to play our role as well.</i>

01:11:30.385 --> 01:11:31.787
That's ridiculous.

01:11:32.987 --> 01:11:34.219
Yulia?

01:11:34.221 --> 01:11:35.220
She alive?

01:11:35.222 --> 01:11:36.457
- All right.
- She alive?

01:11:42.329 --> 01:11:43.528
Hold her down.

01:11:43.530 --> 01:11:45.263
All right, she ain't shot.

01:11:45.265 --> 01:11:46.866
You're okay, hang in there.

01:11:46.868 --> 01:11:48.904
Hang in there. We've got you. Oh, boy!

01:11:51.072 --> 01:11:52.738
She, she ain't shot.

01:11:52.740 --> 01:11:54.607
- Oh, thank God.
- She ain't shot.

01:11:54.609 --> 01:11:55.944
Got some sort of...

01:11:58.313 --> 01:12:00.112
Oh, no.

01:12:00.114 --> 01:12:02.581
What the fuck is this shit?

01:12:02.583 --> 01:12:05.017
What is that? What is it?

01:12:05.019 --> 01:12:06.488
Peruvian flake.

01:12:08.722 --> 01:12:10.059
One hundred percent probably. Come on.

01:12:13.795 --> 01:12:15.061
Damn.

01:12:15.063 --> 01:12:17.099
Look at the detail of this tower, huh.

01:12:17.931 --> 01:12:19.799
It's like fucking Aladdin was...

01:12:19.801 --> 01:12:23.135
up 24-36 hours straight
on QBC or something.

01:12:25.907 --> 01:12:27.272
He's got security alarm system.

01:12:27.274 --> 01:12:30.041
Oh, Iskandar got a couple
of things on the calender.

01:12:30.043 --> 01:12:31.713
Couple of dates he ain't gonna make.

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.482
You hear that resonance?

01:12:37.484 --> 01:12:39.085
Jackpot, baby.

01:12:39.087 --> 01:12:42.287
The refrigerator. Here we go.

01:12:42.289 --> 01:12:43.656
Keys to the Tesla.

01:12:43.658 --> 01:12:45.324
- Tesla?
- Tesla.

01:12:47.095 --> 01:12:48.393
Can you tambo, man?

01:14:50.717 --> 01:14:52.653
<i>Are you feeling sad, Tommy?</i>

01:14:53.921 --> 01:14:55.189
<i>Are you having trouble?</i>

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:02.894
<i>Are you sad to loose your
friend and that stupid girl?</i>

01:15:02.896 --> 01:15:04.830
<i>Are you even sure of what's real,</i>

01:15:04.832 --> 01:15:06.432
<i>or what's not real?</i>

01:15:06.434 --> 01:15:07.836
<i>It doesn't matter, Tommy.</i>

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:19.844
<i>It doesn't matter, Tommy.</i>

01:15:19.846 --> 01:15:23.549
<i>Everyone is acting all the time.</i>

01:15:23.551 --> 01:15:25.287
<i>Everyone is filming all the time.</i>

01:15:26.354 --> 01:15:27.954
<i>It doesn't matter anymore.</i>

01:15:27.956 --> 01:15:29.324
<i>You see that right?</i>

01:15:30.824 --> 01:15:32.692
<i>When things happened,
when things didn't happen.</i>

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.492
<i>What happened or didn't happen,</i>

01:15:34.494 --> 01:15:36.795
<i>all things happen at once.</i>

01:15:36.797 --> 01:15:38.132
<i>Don't they, Tommy?</i>

01:15:41.636 --> 01:15:43.803
<i>Does this trouble you, Tommy?</i>

01:15:43.805 --> 01:15:45.905
<i>What came first?
What was re-written?</i>

01:15:45.907 --> 01:15:49.107
<i>What was news? What
was entertainment?</i>

01:15:49.109 --> 01:15:51.943
<i>It doesn't matter
anymore, does it, Tommy?</i>

01:15:51.945 --> 01:15:53.845
<i>You see that now.</i>

01:15:53.847 --> 01:15:55.783
<i>I can see that you see that now.</i>

01:15:57.618 --> 01:16:00.855
<i>Are you ready to have your face
taken off with a scalpel, Tommy?</i>

01:16:02.256 --> 01:16:03.425
<i>The surgeon is ready.</i>

01:16:15.302 --> 01:16:16.305
Tommy?

01:16:21.141 --> 01:16:22.077
Tommy?

01:16:24.444 --> 01:16:25.413
Can you hear me?

01:16:26.447 --> 01:16:27.748
Can you hear me?

01:16:32.453 --> 01:16:33.388
Hm?

01:16:35.456 --> 01:16:37.458
I'm sorry about Sebastian.

01:16:39.193 --> 01:16:40.228
And the girl.

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:46.400
And I want you to know
that it was not my decision.

01:16:51.005 --> 01:16:51.940
Syd.

01:16:54.074 --> 01:16:56.010
Entertainment today, huh?

01:17:00.148 --> 01:17:02.217
Really makes me miss Jimmy Stewart.

01:17:22.537 --> 01:17:23.505
Bye, my friend.

01:18:02.609 --> 01:18:04.309
Excellent work, guys.

01:18:04.311 --> 01:18:06.411
I think we have everything we need.

01:18:06.413 --> 01:18:09.815
- I agree.
- We killed off all the foreigners. Thank you.

01:18:09.817 --> 01:18:11.183
Killed the best friend.

01:18:11.185 --> 01:18:13.085
Gave the female audience a...

01:18:13.087 --> 01:18:16.287
a couple of implausible, yet
charming, although ultimately

01:18:16.289 --> 01:18:18.389
star-crossed and doomed romances,

01:18:18.391 --> 01:18:19.959
plus...

01:18:19.961 --> 01:18:21.593
Corruption at the highest level.

01:18:21.595 --> 01:18:24.562
I mean, we should be able to edit
this into a bring-up first season

01:18:24.564 --> 01:18:26.031
of all-American television.

01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:27.566
Not to mention, seeding

01:18:27.568 --> 01:18:31.536
the mysterious evil
weirdo to become, maybe,

01:18:31.538 --> 01:18:32.640
the next season's villain.

01:18:35.676 --> 01:18:36.878
I'll take that.

01:18:41.916 --> 01:18:43.348
Who is that guy?

01:18:43.350 --> 01:18:45.351
That man is...

01:18:45.353 --> 01:18:46.585
family man.

01:18:46.587 --> 01:18:48.920
That man is a philanthropist.
And more importantly,

01:18:48.922 --> 01:18:50.559
that man is a friend. A dear friend.

01:18:55.095 --> 01:18:57.064
Anyways, his footage is over there.

01:18:57.597 --> 01:18:58.533
Over here...

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:04.570
I got dead Sebastian.

01:19:04.572 --> 01:19:06.338
- In the box?
- In the box.

01:19:06.340 --> 01:19:07.339
All the footage,

01:19:07.341 --> 01:19:09.074
all the footage of
Sebastian is in this box.

01:19:09.076 --> 01:19:10.875
Now, I'm gonna take this box

01:19:10.877 --> 01:19:12.911
to my editors for season one.

01:19:12.913 --> 01:19:13.946
Excited to see it.

01:19:13.948 --> 01:19:15.246
You know what else? Park? Done.

01:19:15.248 --> 01:19:17.049
Panama Canal? Back in our control.

01:19:17.051 --> 01:19:19.151
China? Bent over barrel, and anally raped.

01:19:19.153 --> 01:19:20.952
Fucking, Grand Slam, guys.

01:19:20.954 --> 01:19:22.655
Grand fucking Slam.

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:23.621
It's a triple.

01:19:23.623 --> 01:19:25.257
Yeah. It's definitely a triple.

01:19:25.259 --> 01:19:27.593
- Triple?
- American baseball's a triple.

01:19:27.595 --> 01:19:28.693
Four is a grand slam.

01:19:28.695 --> 01:19:30.094
- Well, three is a triple.
- What?

01:19:30.096 --> 01:19:31.664
It's not cricket.

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:33.464
- Hey, why is he bringing cricket into this?
- Okay, guys...

01:19:33.466 --> 01:19:35.534
From the sub-continent, cricket
is the dominant game down there.

01:19:35.536 --> 01:19:36.968
Here we play baseball.

01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:38.704
Baseball, three is a triple. That's
all I am saying. Nothing of it.

01:19:38.706 --> 01:19:40.873
Okay, guys, we actually have
Amanda down in the waiting room,

01:19:40.875 --> 01:19:43.541
and I need to know what I'm dealing with.

01:19:43.543 --> 01:19:46.211
How much LSD did Iskandar inject her with?

01:19:46.213 --> 01:19:48.479
Like... You mean, like,
in terms of dollar amount?

01:19:48.481 --> 01:19:50.648
I don't even... I don't know how much

01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:52.487
LSD costs, but, sure.

01:19:53.087 --> 01:19:54.452
Was a lot. Was a lot.

01:19:54.454 --> 01:19:56.421
I mean, I would say,

01:19:56.423 --> 01:19:58.393
I mean, she can't walk,
but she's not going to die.

01:19:59.060 --> 01:20:00.328
I wouldn't bet.

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:18.413
Shows <i>over, kiddo.</i>

01:20:19.412 --> 01:20:22.481
<i>Got you going away
present in your pocket.</i>

01:20:22.483 --> 01:20:24.052
<i>Send her in, please.</i>

01:20:25.786 --> 01:20:28.152
This is gonna be awesome.

01:20:28.154 --> 01:20:31.025
Amanda, darling. Are you all right?

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:36.861
Uh, why don't you get her a chair there.

01:20:36.863 --> 01:20:42.000
Darling, Sam here is going
to take you to the airport.

01:20:42.002 --> 01:20:45.271
I have to tell you, you
have done an incredible job,

01:20:45.273 --> 01:20:48.173
and there is someone we'd like you to meet.

01:20:48.175 --> 01:20:50.541
A really big time producer.

01:20:50.543 --> 01:20:52.343
