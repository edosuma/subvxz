WEBVTT

00:10.093 --> 00:11.845
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
-Walk.

00:11.928 --> 00:14.014
-Where?
-Away.

00:15.598 --> 00:17.142
Did anybody see?

00:17.183 --> 00:18.643
Just keep walking.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.103
What do I do with the gun?

00:20.145 --> 00:21.646
I don't know, we'll find
a place to ditch it.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.106
Like the forest?

00:23.148 --> 00:24.399
Do you see a forest
anywhere nearby?

00:24.482 --> 00:27.360
Hey... (stammers)
Just relax!

00:27.444 --> 00:28.987
Sorry, I'm a little shook up.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.238
A little? I just peed myself.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.365
Hold on, the gun.
The gun. The gun.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.953
All right. Do you think, uh,
you think he's dead?

00:36.995 --> 00:38.663
Probably.

00:38.747 --> 00:39.998
Damn it, I killed a guy.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.125
-Yeah, you did.
-(phone vibrates)

00:43.126 --> 00:44.836
Not a good time.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.338
Yeah, 408.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.340
Hold on, hold on.
The gun. The gun.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.633
Yeah, no.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.553
The, uh, Hawaii game
hasn't kicked off yet, so...

00:54.346 --> 00:57.390
Yeah, 300 bills on the over.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.352
I got you down.

01:00.435 --> 01:02.312
Like that's gonna
save his Saturday.

01:02.354 --> 01:04.105
It's a bad bet.

01:04.855 --> 01:06.191
Hey.

01:06.274 --> 01:08.818
Chickenshit motherfucker.

01:08.860 --> 01:11.237
You're not wrong.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.702
That was cold, Hector.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.872
I know. I feel really bad.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.624
Seatbelts.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.879
Fucking seatbelts suck.

01:29.756 --> 01:32.384
Needless to say,
there's no charge.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.511
You're lucky I'm not
on a killing spree.

01:34.551 --> 01:37.555
-So that guy's dead?
-Yeah, probably.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.100
Want me to do a little drive-by,
scout it out?

01:40.183 --> 01:41.393
No, take me home.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.186
-You too, Ray?
-Yeah.

01:43.228 --> 01:45.271
Okay. Uh, routing-wise,

01:45.354 --> 01:46.856
what's the most efficient--

01:46.898 --> 01:48.483
-Ray and then me.
-Really?

01:48.566 --> 01:50.485
You don't think it'd be quicker
if he takes the 405

01:50.568 --> 01:52.112
and gets off on La Cienega?

01:52.195 --> 01:54.114
There's construction on the 405,
so I'd avoid it.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.490
You know what,
you guys have had a night.

01:55.573 --> 01:57.533
Let me and Google Maps
get you home.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.119
Thank you.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.042
Would either of you
like a complimentary water?

02:06.084 --> 02:08.127
Man, just keep on driving.

02:10.422 --> 02:11.715
DANNY:
Pull over.

02:11.756 --> 02:13.800
-HECTOR: Why?
-DANNY: Just do it.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.512
RAY:
What are you doing?

02:17.595 --> 02:19.431
I'm getting rid of the gun.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.270
Are you kidding me?

02:25.353 --> 02:27.397
-DANNY: What?
-I can still see it.

02:27.439 --> 02:29.190
I couldn't get
full extension back here.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.775
Well, you can't just
leave it there.

02:30.817 --> 02:31.860
Try it again.

02:34.112 --> 02:35.488
Open the car, dipshit.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.156
My bad.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.370
I just bought these shoes.

02:47.000 --> 02:47.959
RAY:
Try it again, Alice!

02:48.001 --> 02:49.293
That was good.

02:49.336 --> 02:50.712
Throw it like you're
going to jail.

02:50.795 --> 02:51.880
Forever.

02:51.963 --> 02:53.673
Fuckin' hate my life.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.473
Happy?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.894
♪ ♪

03:16.696 --> 03:18.490
(horn honks)

03:33.838 --> 03:35.382
(sighs)

03:38.301 --> 03:39.969
We need to talk.

03:41.096 --> 03:43.473
(sighs)

03:45.016 --> 03:46.393
So, can we talk?

03:46.476 --> 03:49.020
Kinda had a rough night.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.397
Maybe in the morning?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.023
In the morning,
I gotta get Anthony up

03:52.065 --> 03:53.775
and beg him to eat breakfast,
take him to school,

03:53.858 --> 03:55.694
squeeze in Pilates
and then I gotta open the shop

03:55.735 --> 03:57.487
because Christine
can't work Mondays anymore.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.364
(groans) Fine, talk.

04:00.281 --> 04:01.950
No, no. You're tired.

04:02.033 --> 04:05.328
I was just going to apologize
for earlier, but fuck it.

04:05.370 --> 04:08.039
Fuck you. Fuck everything.

04:09.290 --> 04:11.042
Okay.

04:16.297 --> 04:19.050
It's possible
I'm happier in jail.

04:24.723 --> 04:26.266
Hey.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.393
How you doing?

04:28.476 --> 04:31.229
I was gonna make myself
a bowl of cereal.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.856
You want some?

04:35.400 --> 04:38.862
You know, that sounds
pretty good.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.409
How are things at school going?

04:46.244 --> 04:47.620
Same.

04:48.788 --> 04:51.457
But they're leaving you alone?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.918
Pretty much.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.964
Hey, uh,

04:58.048 --> 05:01.051
how would you feel
about us getting a cat?

05:01.092 --> 05:02.677
(chuckles)

05:05.638 --> 05:08.391
I don't know, buddy,
I'm pretty allergic.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.435
Okay.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.740
You got one already, didn't you?

05:24.741 --> 05:25.950
Yeah.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.256
Morning.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.800
Good morning.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.176
You okay?

05:43.259 --> 05:44.803
Yeah. Why?

05:44.886 --> 05:47.806
'Cause you got that droopy dog
look, like somebody died.

05:49.724 --> 05:52.268
Oh, Lord Jesus,
did somebody die?

05:52.310 --> 05:55.355
No, no, of course not.

05:56.147 --> 05:57.524
What do you got going today?

05:57.607 --> 05:59.484
Same as usual.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.486
-Working with Danny.
-Mm-hmm.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.948
It don't bother you that
that little Italian boy

06:04.989 --> 06:06.324
might be using you?

06:06.366 --> 06:07.992
Nobody's using me, Grandma.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.703
Everybody uses you.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.414
Your baby mommas,
your low-life friends

06:12.497 --> 06:13.540
with their money-making schemes.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.000
And don't forget,

06:15.083 --> 06:17.836
I was in the room when
that freckle-faced fatty

06:17.877 --> 06:20.922
talked you into playing football
in Provo, Utah.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.008
I got a good education
at Brigham Young.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.259
Good education?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.429
How much did you make
in the NFL?

06:27.512 --> 06:29.514
Nine, ten million dollars?

06:29.597 --> 06:31.141
Those Mormons
didn't even teach you

06:31.182 --> 06:32.517
how to balance a checkbook.

06:32.558 --> 06:33.518
Are you done?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.687
Oh, I'm just warming up.

06:35.770 --> 06:38.773
You got to lose
this Danny Calamari.

06:38.857 --> 06:39.941
Colavito.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.695
That one was born for the rope.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.697
Danny's my friend.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.866
I trust him. End of story.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.701
End of something.

06:50.534 --> 06:52.037
You want French toast?

06:52.120 --> 06:54.539
Yes, ma'am.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.042
No reason to be
stupid and hungry.

06:57.082 --> 06:59.502
(hip hop plays on radio)

07:05.133 --> 07:07.177
(radio turns off)

07:09.512 --> 07:10.972
What do you mean,
what do they smell like?

07:11.056 --> 07:12.432
They're mushrooms.

07:12.515 --> 07:14.559
Like a nice risotto.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.061
(buzzer sounds)

07:16.102 --> 07:17.187
I don't know,

07:17.228 --> 07:18.480
I would hope the airport dogs

07:18.563 --> 07:20.023
are sniffing for bombs.

07:20.065 --> 07:21.358
Listen, if you're

07:21.399 --> 07:23.068
so concerned,
ask your girlfriend

07:23.109 --> 07:26.196
if she feels comfortable
using her ass as a purse.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.031
I gotta go. Have fun in Cabo.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.408
Here's the action
that came in last night

07:30.450 --> 07:32.284
-and this morning.
-Oh, look at you
with the cursive.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.245
-Let me get in there.
-Why, what are you doing?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.789
The G-wagon we took in trade?

07:35.872 --> 07:38.291
-Looking up the guy.
-Why?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.001
-Got repoed.
-Oh, let me guess.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.378
Instead of
cutting his balls off,

07:41.419 --> 07:42.504
you want to have
a talk with him.

07:42.587 --> 07:44.422
I want to get paid, all right?

07:44.464 --> 07:45.924
Balls are not
the coin of the realm.

07:46.007 --> 07:48.426
Fun fact, nobody in the NFL
wears a cup.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.095
Balls get shattered
on a daily basis.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.472
-How is that pertinent?
-Sorry.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.682
Just sharing an anecdote.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.933
And we're all better for it.

07:56.017 --> 07:57.352
Thank you, Ray.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.770
Let's go.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.401
When are you gonna tell him
about you and me?

08:04.442 --> 08:05.568
I'm thinking never.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.237
That's why you two get along.

08:07.278 --> 08:08.530
You're both pussies.

08:08.613 --> 08:09.989
I'll see yours tonight.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.700
Yeah, you will.

08:12.450 --> 08:14.160
-(sighs)
-(hip hop plays on radio)

08:14.244 --> 08:15.537
Could we please?

08:15.620 --> 08:18.540
What would you prefer?
"Song Sung Blue"?

08:18.623 --> 08:20.457
Something with
a positive message

08:20.542 --> 08:22.085
and a little less N-word?

08:22.127 --> 08:23.586
Oh, speaking of which,

08:23.628 --> 08:25.588
any updates on our dead N-word?

08:25.630 --> 08:27.757
Nothing. I don't get it.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.217
You'd think it'd be
all over the news.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.344
Black junkie gets shot
in downtown Los Angeles.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.722
Only way that makes the news
is if he bleeds on a white man.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.974
Sad state of affairs.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.684
State of affairs for
the last 400 fucking years.

08:38.768 --> 08:40.145
You know the Italians

08:40.186 --> 08:41.938
didn't have an easy go of it
in this country.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.690
Don't.

08:45.150 --> 08:47.068
They didn't.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.571
(phone rings)

08:49.654 --> 08:51.322
Yeah?

08:51.406 --> 08:52.824
HECTOR:
It's me.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.617
You want to be a little bit
more specific?

08:54.659 --> 08:56.244
Hector.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.370
Yeah, Hector, what's up?

08:57.454 --> 08:59.539
I'm looking at, uh...

08:59.622 --> 09:02.208
ground zero,
if you catch my drift.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.335
Yeah? And?

09:03.418 --> 09:05.920
Nothing. No cops.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.757
No body. No chalk outline.

09:08.840 --> 09:10.342
None of those
little plastic cones

09:10.425 --> 09:11.676
you see on the TV shows.

09:11.760 --> 09:14.179
-That's impossible.
-What?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.139
He's at where I shot the guy.
There's nothing there.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.182
That's impossible.

09:17.223 --> 09:18.600
I just said--

09:18.683 --> 09:20.560
How about blood?
Is there any blood?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.604
Can't see from here,

09:22.687 --> 09:24.105
but it's like nothing happened.

09:24.189 --> 09:25.148
Hang on.

09:25.190 --> 09:26.858
You said I shot the guy.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.526
Well, to be fair,
when it went down,

09:28.610 --> 09:30.362
I closed my eyes
and said, "Lord Jesus,

09:30.403 --> 09:31.696
-can you help me?"
-Oh, God.

09:31.780 --> 09:32.739
Look, we both saw him
on the ground.

09:32.822 --> 09:33.907
He didn't just slip.

09:33.990 --> 09:35.033
Well, maybe you wounded him

09:35.075 --> 09:36.993
and he walked away on his own...

09:37.035 --> 09:39.579
what do you call it, volition.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.373
Hmm.

09:41.414 --> 09:43.917
Holy shit, I might not have
blood on my hands.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.877
Thanks, Hector. I owe you.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.962
-Great, give me a job.
-Doing what?

09:48.046 --> 09:49.673
How much money gets bet
on soccer games?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.216
We don't see much action.

09:51.299 --> 09:52.676
Because you, my friends,

09:52.717 --> 09:54.302
don't speak the language of...

09:54.386 --> 09:58.264
Goal!

10:05.647 --> 10:08.316
Hi, we're here
to see Bobby Knox.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.859
Who should I tell him is here?

10:09.901 --> 10:11.277
Could you do us a favor?

10:12.404 --> 10:13.405
We want to surprise him.

10:13.488 --> 10:14.906
Big day.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.868
Penthouse.
Elevator's on the left.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.537
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

10:20.578 --> 10:23.331
I'll save you a slice.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.543
(elevator bell dings)

10:27.335 --> 10:29.587
-So, how do you wanna play this?
-Well, we leave with cash

10:29.629 --> 10:31.631
or we frog-march this
motherfucker down to the bank.

10:31.715 --> 10:33.717
That works for me.

10:38.847 --> 10:40.265
Did I detect a little sparkle

10:40.306 --> 10:42.267
between you
and Officer Front Desk?

10:42.308 --> 10:44.185
Yeah, there was
something there, right?

10:45.353 --> 10:49.399
Maybe she could be the mother
of your 11th child.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.860
Now why you gotta go there?

10:51.943 --> 10:54.029
What? It's a little
friendly banter.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.114
We're giving each other
the so-called business.

10:56.197 --> 10:56.948
Oh, okay.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.117
It's a two-way street.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.493
Take a shot.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.287
(elevator bell dings)

11:02.370 --> 11:04.289
I'm fucking your sister.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.759
Don't suck his dick,
you won't get paid.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.806
Hello?

11:23.099 --> 11:24.309
Bobby?

11:28.438 --> 11:29.481
Out there.

11:29.564 --> 11:32.108
Oh, shit.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.736
You know, there's
a strong case to be made

11:34.819 --> 11:36.446
for us just backing out of here.

11:36.488 --> 11:37.906
He owes us $38,000.

11:37.989 --> 11:39.783
He didn't pay
for a blowjob, Danny.

11:39.824 --> 11:41.201
What's the likelihood
of us getting paid?

11:41.284 --> 11:43.286
You got to try.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.206
Hey, Bobby.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.415
Hey, Danny. Ray.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.793
Hey.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.169
What's the plan here?

11:52.087 --> 11:53.546
What's it look like?

11:53.630 --> 11:54.964
Looks like you're going to jump.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.676
-Danny.
-Smart money's on splat.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.094
Come on, Bobby,

11:59.177 --> 12:01.054
you're not gonna jump. Just...

12:01.137 --> 12:02.681
-just get down from there.
-Eh.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.933
There's no reason
to stick around.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.685
People, they only like me
for my money,

12:06.768 --> 12:08.353
and that's all fucking gone.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.730
What do you mean, gone?

12:10.814 --> 12:12.357
I-I blew through my trust fund.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.610
Gambling? Drugs?

12:15.694 --> 12:17.278
Oh, you'd think, right? Nope.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.824
I sank it all into
a plant-based dog food company.

12:21.866 --> 12:23.785
But dogs are carnivores.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.538
That's right, Ray.

12:26.621 --> 12:27.914
Yeah, tough break.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.374
Listen, you know that Mercedes

12:29.457 --> 12:30.709
you paid us off with?

12:30.792 --> 12:31.876
Yeah.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.712
It got repoed, so you're back to

12:33.753 --> 12:35.338
a big number with us.

12:35.380 --> 12:37.424
Oh, wow. I'm sorry.

12:38.258 --> 12:39.884
Let's just punt that for now.

12:39.968 --> 12:41.302
There any chance we can get you

12:41.386 --> 12:43.304
to swing those legs around
and come inside?

12:43.388 --> 12:45.515
-No.
-DANNY: Come on, talk.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.183
Let's have a cup of coffee.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.685
Perhaps you could point out

12:48.727 --> 12:51.855
some artwork in the home
that's fungible.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.189
What?

12:53.231 --> 12:54.774
DANNY:
Fungible. Resale value.

12:54.858 --> 12:57.360
-Danny.
-I'm making lemonade, Ray.

12:58.528 --> 13:01.448
Bobby, look, man,

13:01.531 --> 13:02.824
I know it's hard.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.826
I been there.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.912
I ran through
every last penny that I had.

13:07.954 --> 13:09.789
And I owe.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.292
Oh, God, I owe so much.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.503
But I'm not giving up.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.589
There's too much good
in the world,

13:17.630 --> 13:19.090
and I want to be a part of it.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.550
I want to bear witness.

13:20.592 --> 13:21.676
What's good?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.470
Are you-- Are you kidding me?

13:23.553 --> 13:25.597
The sound of a baby's laugh.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.349
A beautiful woman.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.853
A magnificent sunset?

13:31.936 --> 13:34.356
Yeah, no, no, sunsets.

13:34.439 --> 13:38.068
Sunups.
Can't forget sunups, you know?

13:38.109 --> 13:41.279
Scrambled eggs
with a side of hashbrowns.

13:41.363 --> 13:43.823
Some toast
with some strawberry jam.

13:43.907 --> 13:45.617
Organic broccoli.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.452
Good and good for you.

13:47.494 --> 13:50.121
-I mean, I could go on.
-Please don't.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.999
When was the last time you ate?

13:53.083 --> 13:55.043
Had a decent night's sleep?

13:55.085 --> 13:57.420
Oh, it's, uh, it's been
a couple of days, you know?

13:57.462 --> 13:58.838
Kind of been on a run.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.298
Eh.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.634
That could be
affecting your thinking.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.637
I'm really sorry about the car.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.347
That's okay.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.973
Just come on down.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.936
Okay, all right.

14:15.730 --> 14:17.524
Good. (chuckles)

14:19.859 --> 14:21.903
You like birthday cake?

14:21.986 --> 14:23.613
We brought you
some birthday cake.

14:23.655 --> 14:24.948
But it's not my birthday.

14:24.989 --> 14:26.449
Are you sure about that?

14:26.491 --> 14:28.868
'Cause, in a way,
you were just reborn.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.328
What's the old saying?

14:30.412 --> 14:32.747
First day
of the rest of your life.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.748
Huh.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.583
I like that. Thanks, Ray.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.044
You know, I noticed
when we came in

14:38.128 --> 14:40.171
you have some very nice rugs.

14:41.506 --> 14:42.799
Lemonade.

14:42.841 --> 14:43.883
Unbelievable.

14:43.967 --> 14:45.135
We saved a life, man.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.344
-Yes, we did.
-That's gotta

14:46.386 --> 14:47.804
even out the karma a little bit.

14:47.846 --> 14:48.847
-Yeah.
-Big man.

14:48.888 --> 14:50.181
Yes.

14:50.265 --> 14:51.224
Call me.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.434
I will.

14:57.772 --> 14:59.524
What about my sister?

14:59.566 --> 15:00.942
What about her?

15:01.026 --> 15:02.736
You're putting me in
a very awkward position.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.279
Your sister likes those.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.660
I'm gonna set that aside
for the moment

15:10.702 --> 15:13.204
and enjoy the fact
that a man is alive

15:13.288 --> 15:15.165
because we did the right thing.

15:15.957 --> 15:18.001
Yeah, I guess.

15:27.302 --> 15:29.929
I did four years hard time,

15:30.013 --> 15:31.556
didn't see one dead body.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.309
Yeah, people got shivved,
set on fire.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.686
But I only heard about it
at lunch.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.481
Ah, Danny. Ray.

15:39.564 --> 15:41.191
-Oh, shit.
-Hey, I'm not here as a cop,

15:41.232 --> 15:42.400
I'm here as a friend.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.402
-Oh, shit.
-How's the leg?

15:44.444 --> 15:45.820
In constant pain.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.739
-Aw.
-What is that, nicotine gum?

15:47.781 --> 15:48.782
Yeah.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.492
When'd you quit smoking?

15:50.575 --> 15:51.785
24 years ago.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.245
Well, look, I just got a call

15:54.287 --> 15:56.915
about an apparent suicide
over in Westwood.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.000
I looked at the security tapes,

15:59.084 --> 16:00.585
and who did I see with a cake

16:00.669 --> 16:02.671
and a fucking balloon?

16:02.754 --> 16:04.381
That was us.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.424
Thought we might cheer Bobby up.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.343
Mm-hmm, that was the plan,
to cheer him up?

16:08.426 --> 16:09.678
What do you want, Carl?

16:09.719 --> 16:11.262
How much was he into you for?

16:11.304 --> 16:12.681
-What difference does it make?
-Oh, I don't know.

16:12.764 --> 16:13.848
Sometimes money plays a role

16:13.932 --> 16:14.974
in murder and mayhem.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.434
Murder? It wasn't a murder.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.103
We were waiting on our car
in valet

16:18.144 --> 16:20.730
when Bobby...

16:20.772 --> 16:22.107
arrived.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.942
Arrived? More like exploded.

16:24.526 --> 16:26.111
You should've seen
your faces on that tape.

16:26.194 --> 16:27.112
(mocking whimper)

16:27.195 --> 16:29.155
Well, not that you care,

16:29.239 --> 16:31.074
but the both of us are

16:31.116 --> 16:33.118
-seriously traumatized.
-Mm.

16:33.201 --> 16:35.120
Let me give you
some advice, huh?

16:35.203 --> 16:37.247
Running a sports book
is not something

16:37.288 --> 16:40.165
the LAPD considers
worthy of our attention.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.544
You are our version
of the fire department's

16:42.627 --> 16:44.629
cat in a tree.
Nobody gives a shit.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.132
Until the cats
start killing themselves.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.633
I don't know
what to tell you, Carl.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.302
Yeah, Bobby was into me
for a large number,

16:51.386 --> 16:53.930
but the minute I saw that
he was in emotional distress,

16:53.972 --> 16:55.724
I talked him down.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.142
Whoa, whoa. I talked him down.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.144
We both talked him down, Ray.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.896
We had coffee,
a little birthday cake,

17:01.980 --> 17:03.648
and I left him in a good place.

17:03.732 --> 17:05.483
Jesus, he killed himself
on his birthday?

17:05.525 --> 17:07.152
DANNY:
Tragic, I know.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.486
CARL: You know, Danny,
it's gonna break my heart

17:08.569 --> 17:11.489
when I have
to throw a tarp over you.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.577
I offer a service, Carl.
There's no shenanigans.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.162
It's, "Who do you like
on Monday?"

17:17.244 --> 17:19.039
and let the chips fall
where they may.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.498
No, I know.
It's a victimless crime.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.541
-Exactly.
-Fair enough.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.169
Oh, P.S.,

17:24.252 --> 17:26.171
the money that I owe you,

17:26.212 --> 17:28.798
we're gonna call that even.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.718
Sure.

17:31.801 --> 17:33.470
Good man.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.933
Nobody pays me. What kind of
fuckin' job do I got,

17:39.017 --> 17:41.186
nobody pays me?

17:45.774 --> 17:47.400
What's going on?

17:47.484 --> 17:50.945
$3,800 on Deportivo Iztapa
over Xelajú MC.

17:51.029 --> 17:53.740
-What?
-What?
-Guatemalan soccer league.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.200
After I dropped
you guys off last night,

17:55.283 --> 17:57.744
I found a bar full of illegals,

17:57.827 --> 17:59.454
all from Xelajú.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.873
Gonna need a little more.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.000
They bet with their hearts.
I made a killing.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.627
So what do you need us for?

18:05.710 --> 18:07.504
I need a bank to back me
when I can't cover,

18:07.545 --> 18:09.381
otherwise I'm looking at
a room full of machetes.

18:10.173 --> 18:11.549
What do you think?

18:12.384 --> 18:14.386
Opens up a big market.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.388
It's the world's game,
gentlemen.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.766
Follow us back to the office.
We'll set you up.

18:21.017 --> 18:23.061
Goal!

18:23.144 --> 18:25.397
That's gotta stop.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.399
So each client gets a number.
We don't use names.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.400
HECTOR:
What about nicknames?

18:28.483 --> 18:30.068
Like Rooster, Dirty Dog,

18:30.151 --> 18:31.152
a big guy called Tiny.

18:31.236 --> 18:32.862
You get it.

18:32.904 --> 18:34.489
Just a number.

18:34.572 --> 18:36.449
-Do they pick or do I pick?
-You pick.

18:36.533 --> 18:38.118
What if they don't like their
number, think it's unlucky?

18:38.201 --> 18:42.205
What if you go back to driving
that stupid little car?

18:42.247 --> 18:45.458
Okay, curious minds not welcome.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.919
Then, if they're not placing
their bets online,

18:47.961 --> 18:49.129
they're calling them in.

18:49.212 --> 18:50.296
You write everything down,

18:50.380 --> 18:51.881
you give those bets to Lorraine

18:51.923 --> 18:53.591
and she enters them
into the computer.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.802
Because my brother uses
a phone and a pencil

18:55.885 --> 18:56.970
like a fucking dinosaur.

18:57.053 --> 18:58.304
Because it works, Lorraine.

18:58.388 --> 19:00.473
And I'll tell you
something else.

19:00.557 --> 19:02.350
If and when, God forbid,
the state of California

19:02.434 --> 19:05.770
legalizes sports betting,
what's our edge?

19:05.812 --> 19:08.148
That you extend credit
to lowlife degenerates?

19:08.231 --> 19:10.358
To a degree, yes.
But what I was going for

19:10.442 --> 19:13.194
is I have personal
relationships with my clients.

19:13.278 --> 19:14.988
I've known
some of them for years.

19:15.071 --> 19:18.616
I know when they're celebrating
a christening, a bar mitzvah.

19:18.658 --> 19:21.202
I know when their mother slipped
in the shower and broke her hip.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.871
I know their kids' names.

19:22.954 --> 19:25.290
And you know when they lose
that kid's college money

19:25.331 --> 19:27.125
on a can't-miss parlay.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.460
Ray, can you control your woman?

19:30.462 --> 19:34.215
(relaxing music plays on radio)

19:34.299 --> 19:36.801
DANNY:
Now, this is music.

19:39.054 --> 19:41.473
Can we please fence that thing
before we get mugged again?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.058
Yeah, I'm gonna
set it up with The Cowboy.

19:43.141 --> 19:44.351
Really? The Cowboy?

19:44.434 --> 19:46.144
You know he's gonna lowball us.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.313
Well, what's our other options?
Try our luck at a swap meet?

19:48.396 --> 19:49.981
Okay, okay.

19:51.274 --> 19:52.609
It's too bad.
I'm getting used to it.

19:52.650 --> 19:54.277
You know, it's like having

19:54.319 --> 19:56.821
a small house in the Midwest
on your wrist.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.324
You know, something's
really been bothering me.

19:59.407 --> 20:00.700
What, are you gonna apologize

20:00.784 --> 20:02.285
for sneaking around
with my sister?

20:02.327 --> 20:03.328
No, but if it makes you
feel any better,

20:03.411 --> 20:04.662
it wasn't planned.

20:04.746 --> 20:07.082
Oh, really? No courtship?
No pitching woo?

20:07.165 --> 20:09.793
What's been bothering me
is that guy who mugged us.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.252
He knew about that watch
out of the gate.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.421
He did, didn't he?

20:14.422 --> 20:16.091
I think he was tipped off.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.258
Charlie Sheen?

20:17.342 --> 20:18.802
I don't think so.

20:18.843 --> 20:20.845
Back when he was "winning"
with tiger blood, maybe.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.389
But not now.

20:22.472 --> 20:25.350
Someone at the restaurant?
Waiter? Maître d'?

20:25.392 --> 20:27.143
I'd go with the waiter.

20:27.185 --> 20:28.353
What's the play?

20:28.436 --> 20:30.188
Well, if we want to know

20:30.271 --> 20:32.357
if homeboy's alive or dead,

20:32.440 --> 20:34.943
he might be the guy to squeeze.

20:43.201 --> 20:45.286
Evening.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.288
-Hey.
-Methamphetamine.

20:47.372 --> 20:49.165
Careful, that
could be habit-forming.

20:49.207 --> 20:50.875
What do you want?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.169
You don't remember us?

20:53.211 --> 20:55.714
No.

20:55.797 --> 20:57.841
This help?

20:58.800 --> 21:01.636
So you got a watch.
What do you want from me?

21:01.720 --> 21:03.263
Looking for
a little information.

21:03.346 --> 21:04.556
Like the current whereabouts

21:04.597 --> 21:06.057
of the young man
you sent our way.

21:06.141 --> 21:08.893
DANNY:
Maybe an address,
emergency room.

21:08.977 --> 21:12.147
One of those refrigerated
drawers in the morgue.

21:12.230 --> 21:14.566
Fuck you guys.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.735
Hey, hey, slow down.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.570
Ooh!

21:24.075 --> 21:27.370
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

21:28.288 --> 21:30.290
Hey, where's your friend
with the gun?

21:30.373 --> 21:32.500
Go fuck yourself.

21:32.584 --> 21:35.086
Oh, God. Ray, we should go.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.755
Yeah.

21:37.922 --> 21:39.382
DANNY: I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

21:39.424 --> 21:40.633
but I'm actually looking forward

21:40.717 --> 21:42.927
to a quiet evening at home.
