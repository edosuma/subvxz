-Hey.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.603
-It's late.
-Yeah.

01:01.687 --> 01:04.439
That's not supposed to be
one of Monet's lost frames?

01:04.523 --> 01:06.108
No. Just trying to clear my head.

01:06.191 --> 01:09.736
Good. About that. Vincent Adler.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.905
Seven years ago,
he ran a huge Ponzi scheme

01:11.989 --> 01:14.700
and disappeared with a billion dollars.
You knew him?

01:14.783 --> 01:17.286
He's the man who made me who I am today.

01:17.369 --> 01:20.706
Mmm-hmm.
He's rained hell down on both our lives.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.208
You knew.
You knew and you didn't say anything?

01:23.292 --> 01:25.711
I just figured it out myself, okay?

01:25.794 --> 01:28.755
I'm trying to reconcile the Adler I knew
with the man responsible…

01:28.839 --> 01:30.591
-For Kate? For Mozzie?
-Yeah.

01:30.674 --> 01:31.758
So let's get him.

01:33.594 --> 01:36.597
Come on. Start talking.

01:37.389 --> 01:39.141
Yeah, I'm not much of a beer drinker.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.685
-I know. That's why I brought you this.
-Oh.

01:41.768 --> 01:43.145
Don't recognize the bottle.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.646
That's because it costs
as much as the beer.

01:44.730 --> 01:46.356
Wow, I don't even need a corkscrew.

01:46.440 --> 01:48.192
Nope.

Okay.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.278
Now…

01:52.529 --> 01:53.947
how do you know Adler?

01:54.031 --> 01:55.866
It's a long story.

01:55.949 --> 01:58.118
If we are gonna catch this guy,
just like I caught you,

01:58.202 --> 02:00.954

02:05.751 --> 02:08.212
-It keeps the mystery alive.
-I get it.

02:08.295 --> 02:11.715
This story includes some stuff
about crimes I don't know about.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.841
Yeah.

02:12.925 --> 02:15.511
No. You're not holding back on me.

We've got all night.

until the sun rises over that balcony.

-Full immunity?
-Did you kill anybody?

02:29.149 --> 02:31.902
-No.
-Then full immunity.

02:37.491 --> 02:38.492
Hmm.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.204
All right. Let's start with this.

02:42.287 --> 02:46.124
Mozzie decoded the music box.
It's an equation.

02:46.208 --> 02:48.585
This is what it built.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.379
It's a fractal.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.797
Very good.

02:51.880 --> 02:53.966
-I've seen one like it before.
-Where?

02:54.049 --> 02:55.968
In Vincent Adler's office
when I worked for him.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.427
How did you meet him?

02:58.136 --> 03:00.514
If you wanna know about Adler,
we gotta start with Mozzie.

-Sure. Toss them.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.751
DEALER: Okay. You think you can
follow her, but I'm saying that you can't.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.712
It's all a game of you versus me.

03:33.463 --> 03:37.759

but I think she likes you.

-She's back in the middle.

03:43.974 --> 03:45.976

She's definitely on the right.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.678
Where does he keep it?
Personal safe? Deposit box?

10:36.762 --> 10:39.264
In his head.
He's too smart to keep it anywhere else.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.767
I can't just walk up and ask him for it.
That's impossible.

10:41.850 --> 10:45.437
A wise man once said,
it's fun to do the impossible.

10:45.521 --> 10:48.524
-Bertrand Russell.
-Walt Disney. You should read more.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.778
Our clock is five months.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.697
You ingratiate yourself.
Become a trusted friend.

10:55.781 --> 10:58.492
-Then convince him to tell you.
-Why don't you do it?

10:58.575 --> 11:01.703
I'm more the behind-the-scenes guy.

11:02.955 --> 11:06.124
All right, look at me.
And then look in the mirror.

11:06.208 --> 11:10.462
Who has a better chance of charming Adler
at the charity dinner on Friday?

11:10.546 --> 11:13.090
NEAL: "Antiquities Recovery Project."

11:14.758 --> 11:17.094
It's five grand a plate.
I can't afford that.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.681
Well, you can if you cash in
a few more of your bonds.

11:20.764 --> 11:22.349
PETER: <i>Big mistake.</i>

11:22.432 --> 11:24.518
Cashing those bonds was a calculated risk.

11:24.601 --> 11:27.104
But it was worth it for the con
we were about to run on Adler.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.691
Yeah. But bankrolling them
got us our first visual on you.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.111
If I recall, I wasn't the only one
who made a mistake that day.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.404
-No, hang on. Hang on.
-Yeah.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.031
-Yeah. It was that bank in Midtown.
-(SIGHS WEARILY)

11:40.492 --> 11:42.202
-Hey.
-Did you get it?

11:42.286 --> 11:43.495
Yeah.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.664
The teller was a sweetheart.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.666
Aw, she gave you a sucker.

11:47.749 --> 11:51.128
You know, the irony of that
would not be lost on Alanis Morissette.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.630
PETER: This guy is a forger. He's good.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.133
-What?
-Shh. Brooks Brothers suit.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.926
WOMAN: Yes, I understand.
NEAL: So?

11:58.010 --> 12:01.305
So that means fed
talking to the bank manager. We gotta go.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.599
If anyone tries to cash these bonds,
I want you to call me immediately.

12:03.682 --> 12:06.143
-I never met a fed before.
-Let's keep it that way.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.644
Detain him if possible.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.729
-Absolutely.
-Good.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.190
Excuse me. Sorry.
I couldn't help but overhear.

12:11.273 --> 12:13.483
-Are you with the FBI?
-Special Agent Peter Burke.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.944
Wow. I just took some money
out of the bank,

12:16.028 --> 12:17.279
and I heard you talking
about counterfeiting.

12:17.362 --> 12:20.115
Your money is safe.
I'm looking after counterfeit bonds.

12:20.199 --> 12:22.492
Well, I have some bonds at home.
How would I know if they're not real?

12:23.619 --> 12:24.745
I'm sure they're fine.

12:24.828 --> 12:27.289
Well, thanks again for all
the hard work you're doing, Agent Burke.

12:27.372 --> 12:28.373
That's for you.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.042
Have a good day.

12:35.088 --> 12:38.300
He's not a nanny goat in a petting zoo.
He's a fed.

12:38.383 --> 12:41.345
Within minutes,
he could've set up a five-block perimeter.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.222
Hundreds of trench-coated G-men.

12:43.305 --> 12:45.307
It was worth it. We now know two things.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.185
We gotta move off bonds,
and his name is Peter Burke.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.604
-Know thine enemy, right?
-Fine.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.524
Now, you've got the money
to pay for the invitation.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.817
-What name are you gonna use?
-I don't know.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.656
Halden. Nicholas Halden.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.324
Quaint.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.494
Get yourself a few aliases.
You're gonna need them.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.538
Oh. Pop quiz, hotshot.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.456
Adler's market strategy, pre-crash?

13:09.540 --> 13:11.500
Short derivatives. Bullish on commodities.

13:11.583 --> 13:13.544
Hmm. You've learned much, grasshopper.

13:13.627 --> 13:15.879
Why you filling that bottle
with bargain red?

13:15.963 --> 13:17.548
Have you studied Adler's wine list?

13:17.631 --> 13:18.882
Is that the '91 Bordeaux?

13:18.966 --> 13:20.968
The one year
it was corked in the wrong bottle.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.678
Eight hundred dollars a pop.

13:22.761 --> 13:25.097
-(WHISTLES)
-I, of course, got this bottle empty.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.890
(SNIFFS)

13:26.974 --> 13:28.809
Best served when the guests are drunk.

13:28.892 --> 13:32.437
-(CHUCKLES)
-And I asked my cleaner to keep an eye out

13:32.521 --> 13:34.106
for something in your size.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.899
Yeah. I don't know if I'm a suit guy.

13:35.983 --> 13:37.150
Eh. You'll be fine.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.655
(PIANO PLAYING)

13:44.241 --> 13:46.743
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

13:46.827 --> 13:49.162
ADLER: Well, I really appreciate you
for coming. Thanks.

13:49.913 --> 13:50.914
NEAL: Mr. Adler.

13:50.998 --> 13:53.458
Nick Halden. Nice to meet you.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.002
I brought this from my collection.

13:56.044 --> 13:57.880
That's very generous. Thanks for coming.

13:57.963 --> 14:01.049
Hey, nice play
on the emerging markets last quarter.

14:01.133 --> 14:02.467
You really called Russia.

14:02.551 --> 14:04.344
Well, it all came down
to grains, didn't it?

14:04.428 --> 14:06.096
-Yeah.
-Where do you think they're going?

14:07.347 --> 14:10.309
Bull market. For us, not Europe.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.853
I'd say their imports are up 20 percent.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.857
Interesting. Enjoy the party.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.116
Raphael's <i>Saint George and the Dragon.</i>

14:26.658 --> 14:27.951
That's a powerful piece.

14:28.035 --> 14:31.788
Commodities and art.
You've got diverse interests.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.999
Like you, art is my passion.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.751
Then you should talk to my assistant.

14:36.502 --> 14:37.586
Nick Halden.

14:38.837 --> 14:39.922
Hi.

14:40.756 --> 14:42.174
I'm Kate Moreau.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.219
Hi.

14:54.978 --> 14:56.688
-You like it?
-What?

14:56.772 --> 14:58.941
Oh, yeah. No, it's, uh…

15:00.484 --> 15:01.985
It's breathtaking.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.654
KATE: It's my favorite one.

15:03.737 --> 15:05.864
NEAL: Raphael was a master of balance.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.075
Thick brush strokes for the landscape,

15:08.158 --> 15:11.745
but the skin tones
are almost… translucent.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.041
-Are you an artist?
-I dabble.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.502
I tried. But…

15:18.585 --> 15:20.963
the romance of being a starving artist

15:21.046 --> 15:23.173
-wore off very fast.
-(LAUGHS)

15:23.257 --> 15:25.509
Well, you won't find
any original Nick Haldens

15:25.592 --> 15:27.719
-at a gallery downtown.
-What do you do?

15:28.387 --> 15:29.888
I'm looking for new opportunities.

15:29.972 --> 15:33.016
-Excuse me, sir. May I take that?
-Oh, thank you.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.312
You're here to cozy up to my boss.

15:37.396 --> 15:41.692
Yeah. If I worked for Adler,
I can go anywhere. Any advice?

15:42.484 --> 15:45.279
I've seen the seating chart
and you're nowhere near him.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.989
That's your first challenge.

15:48.866 --> 15:50.242
Hi.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.788
I like a challenge.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.665
Good luck, Nick.

15:56.748 --> 15:57.791
Thanks.

16:27.613 --> 16:30.908
It seems my date has been relegated
to the Buenos Aires table.

16:30.991 --> 16:34.369
You have until the salad course arrives
to tell me what you want.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.331
-Go.
-I wanna work for you.

16:37.414 --> 16:38.540
In what capacity,

16:38.624 --> 16:41.418
other than your enthusiasm
for grains and paint?

16:41.502 --> 16:42.503
Acquisitions.

16:42.586 --> 16:43.670
My team is full.

16:43.754 --> 16:46.548
Cameron Singer,
you're about to buy his firm.

16:48.425 --> 16:50.552
Speculation has been front page
of the <i>Journal</i> all week.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.304
Pass the bread.

16:52.387 --> 16:55.474
He's been avoiding that woman.

16:57.100 --> 16:58.393
ADLER: Hannah Fields?

16:58.477 --> 17:01.313
Next week, Hannah Fields will announce
her new investment branch.

17:02.189 --> 17:03.649
She's buying out Singer.

17:03.732 --> 17:06.693
He's gonna back out of your deal
and the media will eat it up.

17:06.777 --> 17:08.612
Your company will appear unstable.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.905
It could spook investors.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.033
I'm gonna continue my meal now

17:13.116 --> 17:15.202
with someone who looks better
in a cocktail dress than you.

17:15.285 --> 17:17.663
(CHUCKLES) Look into Singer.

17:18.747 --> 17:22.042
If it turns out I'm right… call me.

17:31.885 --> 17:34.513
-The Singer deal, was it true?
-Absolutely.

17:34.596 --> 17:36.265
Mozzie and I
had been spying on them for weeks.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.809
Adler ditched Singer
and brought me in a month later.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.520
He hired you to find things
for him to buy.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.772
Well, part of my job
was knowing everything

17:43.856 --> 17:45.649
about everyone Adler dealt with.

17:45.732 --> 17:46.942
He had a lot of holdings

17:47.025 --> 17:48.569
-and a lot of enemies.
-Hmm.

17:48.652 --> 17:50.988
Turns out I had a knack
for rooting them out.

17:52.072 --> 17:54.157
-And Kate was there the whole time.
-Mmm-hmm.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.909
Was that when you guys got together?

17:55.993 --> 17:58.912
No, no. She had a boyfriend.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.582
NEAL: Mmm. Oh.

18:01.665 --> 18:02.833
It's not there.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.835
All right. We'll just have to try again.

18:04.918 --> 18:08.380
Remind me again why I let you
make my favorite necklace disappear.

18:08.463 --> 18:09.548
Because…

18:11.008 --> 18:12.009
you like magic.

18:16.305 --> 18:19.057
Someday you're going to tell me
all of your secrets.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.392
I mean it.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.103
May I?

18:29.109 --> 18:30.569
Maybe someday.

18:34.740 --> 18:36.283
Come out with me on Friday.

18:42.122 --> 18:43.373
I, um…

18:43.457 --> 18:46.335
I have your assignment from Adler.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.712
He wants you to look into this.

18:50.464 --> 18:51.590
Right.

18:54.051 --> 18:57.262
Looks like someone has been looking
into his recent art acquisitions.

18:57.346 --> 18:58.472
Nick.

19:01.517 --> 19:03.894
Michael asked me
to move to Chicago with him.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.604
Chicago.

19:08.649 --> 19:10.108
Are you gonna go?

19:10.943 --> 19:13.529
Uh, I… I am.

19:13.612 --> 19:14.821
In a month.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.324
That's a big step.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.743
Yeah. I know.

19:20.577 --> 19:23.080
Well, you'll like Chicago. They, uh…

19:23.163 --> 19:26.792
They have a great art museum
and decent pizza.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.837
A little windy. (CHUCKLES)

19:29.920 --> 19:31.463
Yeah, I've heard that.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.383
I should…

19:34.466 --> 19:36.885
-I need to get back to work.
-I should get this.

19:46.979 --> 19:47.980
What is this?

19:48.063 --> 19:49.231
ADLER: It's a fractal.

19:49.314 --> 19:51.775
A mathematical curiosity.

19:52.401 --> 19:54.403
That was the first time you'd seen one?

19:54.486 --> 19:56.363
Yeah. He was obsessed with them.

19:56.446 --> 19:58.949
His were similar to that one,
but none was an exact match.

19:59.032 --> 20:03.120
Okay. So Kate was going
to Chicago with another guy,

20:03.203 --> 20:07.124
and you were trying to root out
whoever was looking into Adler's stuff.

20:07.207 --> 20:08.584
Keep talking.

20:09.793 --> 20:11.044
You found the culprit?

20:11.128 --> 20:12.546
NEAL: She talked her way in.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.923
She seems mostly interested
in your South American acquisitions.

20:15.007 --> 20:16.508
And you got her to come here in person?

20:16.592 --> 20:18.343
Had the foundation feed her a story

20:18.427 --> 20:19.553
that they were impressed
with her research.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.263
She thinks she's here for a job interview.

20:21.346 --> 20:22.890
-Bring her in.
-Yes, sir.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.353
Miss Hunter?

20:30.564 --> 20:31.940
Alex Hunter.

20:32.024 --> 20:33.984
-It's a pleasure to meet you.
-Have a seat.

20:38.447 --> 20:39.656
Miss Hunter,

20:40.824 --> 20:44.077
your passion for antiquities is unusual
for such a young woman.

20:45.162 --> 20:49.666
Well, every object has a story to tell.
I find those stories fascinating.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.293
That was almost convincing.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.212
Who are you working for?

20:54.254 --> 20:56.131
I don't work for anyone.

20:56.215 --> 20:57.591
Yet. That's why I'm here.

20:57.674 --> 20:58.842
ADLER: You can drop the act.

20:58.926 --> 21:01.386
Someone is paying you
to get into my records.

21:01.470 --> 21:03.138
Now, who is that? Why don't you tell me?

21:03.222 --> 21:06.433
-Sir, maybe it would be best if we…
-What are you looking for?

21:07.684 --> 21:10.145
There were rumors
you made some big discoveries.

21:10.229 --> 21:11.313
I got curious.

21:11.396 --> 21:13.732
I thought you wanted to share
your art with the world.

21:13.815 --> 21:15.150
That's for me to decide.

21:17.027 --> 21:20.656
You accessed my private database.
You made copies of my records.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.408
I should bring charges.

21:32.209 --> 21:37.756
Everybody gets one big mistake in life,
and one opportunity to fix it.

21:37.840 --> 21:40.217
I believe in second chances, Miss Hunter.

21:41.927 --> 21:44.388
I think you're clever enough
to know what I mean.

21:54.481 --> 21:57.025
-Thanks, Nick.
-Grateful to be here, Mr. Adler.

21:57.818 --> 21:58.861
Vincent.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.614
Your hard work deserves a reward.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.078
Thank you.

22:09.872 --> 22:12.749
I know I don't meet the buy-in, but…

22:12.833 --> 22:14.501
Nick, come on now.
We've talked about this.

22:14.585 --> 22:16.920
You know I don't like my people
to invest in the fund.

22:17.004 --> 22:18.505
You've made exceptions.

22:20.257 --> 22:21.300
For you.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.343
Thank you, sir.

22:23.427 --> 22:25.304
PETER: <i>You invested your money with him?</i>

22:25.387 --> 22:27.014
NEAL: Mmm. All of it.

22:27.097 --> 22:28.891
We all did. He was making us 14 percent.

22:28.974 --> 22:31.018
You didn't know it was a scam?

22:31.101 --> 22:33.770
My goal at the time
was to prove my loyalty to Adler.

22:33.854 --> 22:34.855
The job became my life.

22:34.938 --> 22:38.025
PETER: Then what happened to Alex?
I know there's more to that story.

22:41.570 --> 22:43.030
(KATE GIGGLING)

22:45.032 --> 22:46.033
You're sweet.

22:47.576 --> 22:49.203
ALEX: Nice trick.

22:50.162 --> 22:51.205
You got me.

22:51.288 --> 22:54.041
-You got off easy.
-Too late to apologize.

22:54.124 --> 22:56.710
I'm not gonna apologize.
It's my job to catch you.

22:56.793 --> 22:58.712
It's your job to not get caught.

22:58.795 --> 22:59.963
Fair enough.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.591
What do you want?

23:04.760 --> 23:06.762
Buy me a drink and we'll talk.

23:11.308 --> 23:12.351
Let's go.

23:13.852 --> 23:15.479
(BOTH SIGH)

23:20.984 --> 23:23.111
Nick Halden, that's a good name.

23:24.321 --> 23:26.198
Not your real one, but I like it.

23:28.700 --> 23:31.203
I recognize a fellow grifter
when I see one, Nick.

23:31.286 --> 23:32.496
All right.

23:35.707 --> 23:36.750
Humor me, Alex.

23:36.834 --> 23:38.794
What were you really looking for?

23:40.671 --> 23:43.340
-Something Adler doesn't have.
-He has everything.

23:43.423 --> 23:44.800
He doesn't have this.

23:45.926 --> 23:47.302
It's a music box.

23:47.386 --> 23:48.971
Quite the Holy Grail.

23:49.054 --> 23:50.681
It's worth about as much.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.060
So Alex turned you on to the music box.

23:55.143 --> 23:56.979
Yeah. She had been chasing it for years.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.814
She heard Adler had information on it.

23:58.897 --> 24:00.232
-Did he?
-He had a rumor.

24:00.315 --> 24:02.776
That it was at the Amalienborg Palace
in Copenhagen.

24:02.860 --> 24:05.404
Said she'd send me a message
if she ever needed my help getting it.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.198
PETER: <i>What kind of message?</i>
NEAL: <i>A flower.</i>

24:08.282 --> 24:09.867
PETER: <i>Did she ever send it?</i>
NEAL: <i>Yeah.</i>

24:09.950 --> 24:11.869
<i>But that's another part of the story.</i>

24:11.952 --> 24:13.787
<i>Alex disappeared. And Kate…</i>

24:13.871 --> 24:15.455
<i>Well, things changed.</i>

24:16.290 --> 24:17.833
MOZZIE: <i>You're taking a sick day?</i>

24:17.916 --> 24:19.543
I'm not allowed to feel lousy?

24:19.626 --> 24:21.795
Every day with Adler counts.

24:21.879 --> 24:24.756
<i>I've already got the siphon in place.</i>
<i>All we need is the password.</i>

24:24.840 --> 24:26.049
I'll get the password.

24:26.133 --> 24:29.011
You know, I'm sensing
your heart isn't totally into this.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.721
My heart is fine.

24:30.804 --> 24:35.309
<i>Ah. This is about the girl.</i>
<i>I thought she left for Chicago.</i>

24:35.392 --> 24:36.518
She left today.

24:36.602 --> 24:38.228
You know, it's probably for the best.

24:38.312 --> 24:40.522
<i>Now you can focus.</i>

24:40.606 --> 24:42.566
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)
-I gotta go, okay?

24:49.990 --> 24:51.283
Kate.

24:51.366 --> 24:53.118
Aren't you supposed to be in Chicago?

24:54.203 --> 24:56.997
It's a big step in the wrong direction.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.081
Why?

25:00.000 --> 25:01.627
Because you're here.

25:13.931 --> 25:17.935
So you and Adler developed a connection,
and you and Kate were finally together.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.228
You had it all.

25:19.311 --> 25:21.897
I was eating the best food,
wearing the best suits,

25:21.980 --> 25:24.107
drinking the best wine,
the kind that has corks.

25:24.191 --> 25:25.859
It was the perfect life.

25:26.652 --> 25:29.112
And it was also the perfect lie.

25:29.196 --> 25:31.114
You and Mozzie
were still working the long con.

25:31.198 --> 25:32.616
Trying to make the lie real.

25:33.825 --> 25:36.537
But every con has an expiration date.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.830
Adler makes the transfer on Friday.

25:38.914 --> 25:41.124
And you still
haven't gotten the password yet.

25:41.208 --> 25:43.168
-I said I'll get it, I'll get it.
-Oh, good.

25:43.252 --> 25:45.712
Because I thought you were
having second thoughts

25:45.796 --> 25:48.715
about abandoning
your new town-and-country lifestyle.

25:48.799 --> 25:50.008
Don't kid yourself.

25:50.092 --> 25:52.886
Kate doesn't even know your real name.
None of them do.

25:52.970 --> 25:56.098
They care about me, okay?
She cares about me.

25:56.181 --> 26:00.978
Um, no. She cares about Nick Halden.
And he doesn't exist.

26:02.646 --> 26:05.190
I hear the suit's
been asking around about you.

26:05.274 --> 26:06.441
He has a sketch.

26:06.525 --> 26:08.110
Where did he get a sketch?

26:08.193 --> 26:11.864
Oh, they always have a sketch
or a print or something.

26:11.947 --> 26:16.118
Look, it's time to finish this job
and move on.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.956
Let's have a look at you.

26:22.666 --> 26:24.626
Never worn a custom suit before.

26:26.295 --> 26:28.964
The fit is perfect.

26:29.047 --> 26:30.048
Except the cuff.

26:30.132 --> 26:32.342
The break should be an eighth of an inch
above the shoe.

26:32.426 --> 26:33.969
-Nelson.
-Good eye, sir.

26:39.892 --> 26:42.144
I can't accept this. It's a $10,000 suit.

26:42.227 --> 26:44.521
You can and you will.

26:44.605 --> 26:46.607
Some people say
dress for the job you want.

26:46.690 --> 26:48.525
I say dress as the man you wanna be.

26:48.609 --> 26:51.236
Nick, men like you and I,
we have an obligation

26:51.320 --> 26:53.864
to assault the commonplace
every chance we get.

26:53.947 --> 26:56.867
From the clothes we wear
to the art we collect

26:56.950 --> 26:58.243
to the women in our lives.

27:01.455 --> 27:03.957
-You and Kate have gotten close.
-Yeah.

27:04.041 --> 27:05.250
You look good together.

27:06.710 --> 27:08.003
How does she feel about it?

27:08.086 --> 27:10.422
There are things about me
that I haven't told her.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.383
I wouldn't worry.

27:13.467 --> 27:17.262
Oftentimes, the things we try and hide
are the most obvious to people around us.

27:19.848 --> 27:21.141
Everything all right?

27:23.352 --> 27:25.812
Nelson, would you excuse us
for a moment? Ahem.

27:25.896 --> 27:27.189
-Of course.
-Thanks.

27:32.569 --> 27:34.154
There's something you should know.

27:34.238 --> 27:35.364
What's wrong?

27:40.285 --> 27:42.996
I flagged a small irregularity
in your account in the Caymans.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.666
Trace analysis reports were inconclusive.

27:45.749 --> 27:47.084
What kind of irregularity?

27:47.167 --> 27:50.087
-Blips from a random IP address.
-Hacker?

27:50.170 --> 27:52.548
It's probably someone
from the bank confirming.

27:52.881 --> 27:55.509
But I'd have to look
into the account details to be sure.

27:57.010 --> 27:58.470
You'd need the password.

28:04.518 --> 28:06.728
I'll arrange a time for us
to go to the bank

28:06.812 --> 28:09.231
so you can access it yourself.

28:09.314 --> 28:10.440
No, no.

28:13.193 --> 28:14.528
I trust you.

28:15.654 --> 28:18.240
Bank closes at 6:00.
Burn this when you're done.

28:21.827 --> 28:23.370
Don't sell yourself short.

28:24.162 --> 28:26.331
Kate will love you for who you really are.

28:26.415 --> 28:27.624
As will others.

28:41.722 --> 28:43.390
You like the hat?

28:43.473 --> 28:45.225
I could get used to it.

28:45.309 --> 28:47.811
Are you all dressed up
with somewhere else to go?

28:47.895 --> 28:50.480
No. I just have to be somewhere by 6:00.

28:50.564 --> 28:52.357
It's a commitment I made a long time ago.

28:52.441 --> 28:55.068
I think that you should blow off
said commitment.

28:55.152 --> 28:56.403
-Yeah?
-Look.

28:56.486 --> 29:01.992
Our violinist agrees.
You are staying here with me.

29:02.075 --> 29:04.870
Look, I promised a friend.
I can't… I can't back out of it.

29:07.831 --> 29:09.458
Kate, I'm…

29:09.541 --> 29:10.876
What's wrong, Nick?

29:14.004 --> 29:18.008
I just feel like you and me and all this,
I don't know.

29:19.968 --> 29:22.513
I feel like I could blink
and it'd all be gone.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.067
You just blinked.

29:36.777 --> 29:38.195
I'm still here.

29:40.364 --> 29:41.740
Then nothing else matters.

29:50.874 --> 29:52.167
You didn't get the password?

29:52.251 --> 29:54.169
You said it yourself, this is a long con.

29:54.253 --> 29:57.005
You stepped on the brakes
when you should've leaned in.

29:57.965 --> 29:59.466
It's Kate, isn't it?

30:00.759 --> 30:01.844
I'm in love with her.

30:04.096 --> 30:07.641
Every conman gets his heart broken once.

30:07.724 --> 30:09.184
She's not gonna break my heart.

30:10.936 --> 30:12.104
Well…

30:13.772 --> 30:16.191
(SIGHS) …we'll get him next time.

30:17.442 --> 30:19.361
Love is a temporary madness.

30:19.444 --> 30:22.948
It erupts like an earthquake
and then subsides.

30:23.031 --> 30:25.742
Hmm. St. Augustine.

30:25.826 --> 30:27.870
Good. You've been reading.

30:27.953 --> 30:28.996
A smart guy told me to.

30:29.079 --> 30:30.247
(CHUCKLES)

30:32.457 --> 30:34.835
(BOTH PANTING)

30:35.419 --> 30:36.628
Oh, my God.

30:39.756 --> 30:41.842
-I want more.
-What?

30:42.759 --> 30:44.219
You're insatiable.

30:45.095 --> 30:47.264
-Pizza.
-What?

30:47.347 --> 30:50.267
We have half a margarita
left over from last night.

30:50.976 --> 30:52.728
-Aw.
-Ah.

30:53.312 --> 30:55.355
Wait. Who says you get the sheet?

30:55.439 --> 30:57.357
-No, no, no.
-Yes, I get it.

30:57.441 --> 30:58.609
Fine.

30:59.026 --> 31:00.777
-Mine.
-All right.

31:02.905 --> 31:03.906
Wow.

31:04.656 --> 31:06.074
-Nick.
-What?

31:06.158 --> 31:07.701
The neighbors could see you.

31:08.827 --> 31:11.580
Oh, hi, neighbors.
Should I give them a little show?

31:11.663 --> 31:14.708
-No. Here. Look. There.
-Ooh, I got a hat, too.

31:14.791 --> 31:16.335
Now you're presentable.

31:18.754 --> 31:22.090
-You like that?
-Put some pants on.

31:22.174 --> 31:23.550
REPORTER: (ON TV) <i>Lord of Wall Street…</i>

31:23.634 --> 31:25.969
You got the sheet,

It's only fair.

31:27.221 --> 31:29.640
REPORTER: <i>Vincent Adler</i>
<i>has disappeared, and with him,</i>

31:29.723 --> 31:32.434

Who'd have figured?

31:56.124 --> 31:57.751
Nobody smelled this coming?

31:57.835 --> 31:59.753
This guy took thousands
of people for their life savings,

31:59.837 --> 32:01.171
including charities.

32:03.090 --> 32:04.591
Clinton Jones.

32:04.675 --> 32:06.301
Word around here
is that you're putting together

32:06.385 --> 32:08.178
a special white collar task force.

32:08.262 --> 32:09.721
I am.

32:09.805 --> 32:11.348
JONES: I've only been here a few months.

32:12.558 --> 32:15.269
But I was wondering if there were
some spots open, if I could get a shot.

32:16.144 --> 32:18.355
Are you the one
who put The Dutchman on our radar?

32:18.438 --> 32:21.900
Yes, sir. I studied
a profile like his at Quantico.

32:21.984 --> 32:26.738
Hmm. Well, I can't promise anything.
It is a long list.

32:26.822 --> 32:29.950
Agents with more seniority,
you know how it is.

32:32.202 --> 32:34.997
That's not the same sucker you got
from James Bonds last year, is it?

32:36.331 --> 32:38.208
-People talk.
-Yeah.

32:38.292 --> 32:40.377
Nobody gets
why I'm still holding on to this.

32:40.460 --> 32:41.587
Unfinished business.

32:43.547 --> 32:44.756
I get it.

32:47.176 --> 32:50.179
So Adler disappeared.
But what about his account?

32:50.262 --> 32:51.847
There was only a dollar left in it.

32:53.140 --> 32:56.685
<i>The password was an anagram for,</i>
<i>"Nice try, Neal."</i>

32:58.687 --> 33:00.647
PETER: <i>Then what happened with Kate?</i>

33:00.731 --> 33:04.484
No money, no jobs. It's all gone.

33:04.568 --> 33:06.445
I know, I know. Hey, hey.

33:06.528 --> 33:07.613
We're gonna be okay.

33:07.696 --> 33:09.823
Just you and me now, right?

33:09.907 --> 33:11.700
That's all that matters.

33:11.783 --> 33:12.826
Come here.

33:14.077 --> 33:16.038
We're gonna get it all back, okay?

33:17.497 --> 33:18.624
Okay.

33:18.707 --> 33:19.833
How?

33:21.460 --> 33:24.671
Look, if we're gonna do this,
I need to tell you something about me.

33:25.255 --> 33:26.298
What?

33:27.799 --> 33:29.051
I'm not Nick Halden.

33:31.386 --> 33:33.222
My name's Neal Caffrey.

33:38.977 --> 33:41.063
You and Kate lost everything.

33:41.146 --> 33:43.857
Adler paid well.
We put it right back into the company.

33:43.941 --> 33:46.777
And why not?
Everything he touched turned to gold.

33:47.694 --> 33:48.862
He conned us.

33:48.946 --> 33:52.074
He conned everybody and then disappeared.

33:52.157 --> 33:53.992
What happened
after you told Kate the truth?

33:54.785 --> 33:56.537
I thought this was about Adler.

33:56.620 --> 33:59.998
Well, I just got a few beers left,
and I'm curious.

34:01.083 --> 34:02.543
I taught her to survive.

34:03.293 --> 34:06.046
Stop! Someone stop that guy!

34:06.129 --> 34:07.548
(SIREN BEEPING)

34:08.757 --> 34:10.592
Freeze! Put your hands up!

34:14.888 --> 34:15.889
Uhh!

34:15.973 --> 34:17.182
Hey. Get up.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.562
Officer, this man stole my package.

34:21.645 --> 34:23.021
I did no such thing.

34:23.105 --> 34:24.273
MAN: Whoa, be careful.

34:24.356 --> 34:26.275
It's a Falcon manuscript
from the 16th century.

34:26.358 --> 34:28.318
Hey, I recognize this guy.

34:30.571 --> 34:33.073
Oh. How you doing, Smedley?

34:33.156 --> 34:35.367
This guy has got warrants out
in three different states.

34:35.450 --> 34:38.287
-Thanks, we can get him off the streets.
-Write him a receipt.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.330
You can't take that. It's worth a fortune.

34:40.414 --> 34:41.498
We'll look after you, okay?

34:41.582 --> 34:43.709
Bring this to the 23rd precinct.

34:43.792 --> 34:45.252
Pick it up from evidence in a few days.

34:45.335 --> 34:46.795
-Days?
-Twenty-third.

34:49.298 --> 34:52.217
I'm a little sick of being scalped
every time we pull one of these.

34:52.301 --> 34:55.846
You know, Mozz,
you look better without the hairpiece.

34:55.929 --> 34:57.139
Very handsome.

35:02.019 --> 35:05.314
Hale takes a cut.
We split the rest three ways.

35:05.397 --> 35:07.232
I don't know, it's not bad.

35:07.316 --> 35:08.442
Thanks.

35:09.776 --> 35:10.903
(SIGHS)

35:10.986 --> 35:13.447
-To all this.
-To the best of times.

35:17.201 --> 35:18.285
And…

35:18.785 --> 35:22.122
to our villa up on the Côte d'Azur.

35:23.040 --> 35:25.000
The sun setting over the Mediterranean.

35:25.083 --> 35:28.378
The olive trees whispering in the hills.

35:28.462 --> 35:29.671
Let's do it.

35:30.672 --> 35:31.882
Let's go.

35:32.549 --> 35:33.800
Now?

35:33.884 --> 35:35.761
-You wanna go to France now?
-Yeah.

35:37.387 --> 35:39.932
Look. That FBI agent, Burke,

35:40.015 --> 35:42.518
he's been asking around
about the British pounds.

35:43.519 --> 35:46.939
Maybe… I don't know,
maybe we should take some time away.

35:47.022 --> 35:48.899
Outside the FBI's range.

35:48.982 --> 35:51.026
We can start in Cap d'Antibes
while it's still warm.

35:51.109 --> 35:54.780
Work our way up to Paris,
over to Amsterdam, then Copenhagen.

36:05.374 --> 36:07.000
I'm not going to Copenhagen.

36:07.751 --> 36:09.461
Okay. I should've mentioned Alex.

36:09.545 --> 36:11.547
This isn't about Alex, Neal.

36:11.630 --> 36:13.882
You can't just say, "Hey, Kate,

36:13.966 --> 36:16.885
"let's go to Copenhagen
for this opportunity Alex told me about."

36:18.095 --> 36:19.513
You just tried to con me.

36:21.139 --> 36:23.141
I made a mistake, okay?

36:28.105 --> 36:29.523
I'm doing this for us.

36:32.401 --> 36:36.029
That music box is worth a fortune.
It can give us the life we want.

36:39.366 --> 36:41.243
You went to Copenhagen without her.

36:41.326 --> 36:43.620
Yeah. The box was there.

36:44.830 --> 36:47.833
But it was a three-person job.
Without Kate, it fell apart.

36:47.916 --> 36:51.044
Alex ended up in a French hospital,
and I barely escaped.

36:51.128 --> 36:53.338
But someone at the palace
pointed the finger at you.

36:53.422 --> 36:55.257
Everyone thought you had the box.

36:55.340 --> 36:57.092
I didn't correct them.

36:57.176 --> 36:59.845
Sure, it gave you great street cred.

36:59.928 --> 37:01.430
I came back to New York.

37:01.513 --> 37:02.514
Kate was gone.

37:02.598 --> 37:04.683
She learned something from me.

37:04.766 --> 37:06.143
Because she disappeared.

37:06.226 --> 37:07.978
I started running big cons.

37:09.146 --> 37:10.856
I guess I was trying to get her attention.

37:10.939 --> 37:12.232
(CHUCKLES)

37:12.316 --> 37:15.611
Well, you certainly got ours,
Steve Tabernacle.

37:15.694 --> 37:17.196
You knew about Steve?

37:17.279 --> 37:19.281
We knew a lot of things.

37:19.364 --> 37:22.910
Before returning to New York,
Caffrey popped up in Denmark and France.

37:22.993 --> 37:24.411
He's not afraid to cross borders.

37:24.494 --> 37:25.954
He definitely does his homework.

37:26.038 --> 37:28.498
We flagged his aliases
at all points of entry.

37:28.582 --> 37:30.667
I mean, we get a hit,
we throw up roadblocks.

37:30.751 --> 37:34.338
No, he'll never use the same ID twice.
Tell me something I haven't heard.

37:35.506 --> 37:37.132
What about you? Agent…

37:37.216 --> 37:38.383
Berrigan.

37:38.467 --> 37:40.594
PETER: You're on the run.
How do I catch you?

37:41.720 --> 37:42.971
Stake out my girlfriend?

37:44.598 --> 37:46.183
Well, Caffrey has one, right?

37:46.266 --> 37:48.477
-We think they split up.
-But we know where she is.

37:48.560 --> 37:50.145
-She know we're on to her?
-No.

37:50.229 --> 37:52.147
We've never had enough on her
to bring her in.

37:52.231 --> 37:54.441
And he hasn't gone anywhere near her.

37:55.734 --> 37:58.237
Hang on. It took us months to catch her,

37:58.320 --> 38:01.031
and she never stays in the same place
for more than a week.

38:01.114 --> 38:02.366
She's hiding from him.

38:03.575 --> 38:04.868
He doesn't know where she is.

38:07.913 --> 38:09.540
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

38:10.916 --> 38:12.125
(DOOR OPENS)

38:13.252 --> 38:15.087
Hey. Rubies in Burma.

38:15.170 --> 38:16.505
I'm gonna need a bush plane to get…

38:17.548 --> 38:20.467
-Oh, no. Did your pigeon die?
-No. Estelle's fine.

38:20.551 --> 38:21.677
Best homer in the city.

38:21.760 --> 38:22.845
Then what?

38:23.846 --> 38:25.430
I received some news.

38:25.514 --> 38:29.351
Some information
has surfaced on the street.

38:29.434 --> 38:30.561
Kate?

38:30.644 --> 38:32.563
You have to understand.

38:32.646 --> 38:35.941
-It comes from a highly unreliable source.
-Where is she?

38:36.024 --> 38:38.360
-His name is Jimmy the Snitch.
-I need a location.

38:39.611 --> 38:41.572
Neal, this smells like a trap.

38:41.655 --> 38:43.448
I don't care. I need to see her.

38:47.911 --> 38:51.164
It's a storage facility.
She'll be there this afternoon.

38:52.833 --> 38:54.084
All right, thanks.

38:55.711 --> 38:56.712
Neal.

38:58.839 --> 38:59.965
Be careful.

39:14.771 --> 39:16.940
Forging Raphael.

39:17.024 --> 39:18.984
You've gotten good.

39:19.067 --> 39:21.403
I heard the real painting was stolen.

39:21.486 --> 39:23.155
I hoped it would get your attention.

39:23.906 --> 39:25.157
It did.

39:27.242 --> 39:28.660
I missed you.

39:28.744 --> 39:32.789
I lied to you about a lot of things, Kate,
but I never lied about loving you.

39:36.001 --> 39:37.336
I believe you.

39:41.590 --> 39:43.050
I love you, too.

39:59.900 --> 40:01.026
How did you find me?

40:01.109 --> 40:04.154
Mozz heard you were fencing
Mauritian penny stamps.

40:05.405 --> 40:07.533
I quit dealing in stamps.

40:11.203 --> 40:12.412
It's okay.

40:14.998 --> 40:17.209
FBI! Hands on your head!

40:21.630 --> 40:22.756
Agent Burke.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.466
Neal Caffrey.

40:24.550 --> 40:25.717
You're under arrest.

40:26.844 --> 40:28.136
I know.

40:31.765 --> 40:33.141
-(GUNS COCKING)
-Thank you.

40:35.602 --> 40:37.062
I never would've found her without you.

40:39.439 --> 40:40.774
It's my pleasure.

40:43.318 --> 40:45.988
So you guys were all
in that municipal van out front.

40:46.071 --> 40:47.573
It's gotta be uncomfortable.

40:47.656 --> 40:49.366
It doesn't smell too good either.

41:09.136 --> 41:10.971
NEAL: <i>And you know the rest.</i>

41:12.097 --> 41:14.433
-All right, so what do we do next?
-We find Adler.

41:14.516 --> 41:16.059
He's the key to this whole damned thing.

41:16.143 --> 41:17.227
Well, I've looked.

41:17.311 --> 41:19.521
His trail didn't go cold, Peter.
There is no trail.

41:20.480 --> 41:23.233
I caught you when I found out
what you wanted most.

41:23.317 --> 41:24.985
We know what he wants most.

41:25.068 --> 41:26.612
-The fractal.
-Yeah.

41:28.155 --> 41:30.657
-What is this?
-You have any ideas?

41:31.366 --> 41:34.995
Must mean something. Must point somewhere.

41:36.622 --> 41:39.124
-Are you telling me the truth, Neal?
-Why do you ask?

41:41.877 --> 41:44.379
I only know one of your friends
who's into origami.

41:44.463 --> 41:46.840
Alex has been here.

41:46.924 --> 41:50.302
And this receipt is from today.

41:50.385 --> 41:52.095
What does she think it is?

41:53.931 --> 41:55.265
It's a fractal antenna.

41:55.349 --> 41:57.684
They're in everything now.
There's one in your cell phone.

41:57.768 --> 42:01.313
And this shape corresponds
to a specific frequency

42:01.396 --> 42:03.023
for an emergency beacon.

42:04.024 --> 42:05.567
-An emergency beacon?
-Mmm-hmm.

42:05.651 --> 42:08.779
You're telling me
that if we build a real one of these,

42:08.862 --> 42:10.197
and we hook that up to a radio…

42:10.280 --> 42:12.074
It's gonna lead us to a boat or a plane

42:12.157 --> 42:14.159
or something that disappeared
in the 1940s.

42:14.243 --> 42:17.079
Something worth killing two people?
Something worth all this?

42:17.162 --> 42:18.747
It's worth it to Adler.

42:20.123 --> 42:22.125
Then I guess we have to find it first.
