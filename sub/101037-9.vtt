I'm gonna kill you,
you son of a bitch.

36:25.620 --> 36:29.034
But before I do,
I'm gonna take something back.

36:29.103 --> 36:30.620
You don't deserve to wear
this fucking brand.

36:33.965 --> 36:35.172
Walker, over here.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.000
This is your last chance.

36:42.068 --> 36:45.482
You prove yourself
and you have our trust.

36:45.551 --> 36:48.448
You turn your back on me now

36:48.517 --> 36:50.000
and I'm gonna take something
from you, too.

37:03.379 --> 37:04.862
- Mister, I don't know you.

37:04.931 --> 37:08.793
But if you're wearing that
brand, you must be a bad man.

37:08.862 --> 37:10.517
And if these motherfuckers
want it back,

37:10.586 --> 37:11.965
you must be even worse.

37:14.586 --> 37:17.275
Karma comes in
all shapes and sizes.

37:17.344 --> 37:19.206
Looks like it's me today.

37:21.379 --> 37:23.586
Y'all best hold him.

37:43.034 --> 37:44.379
- All right.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.896
[ groaning ]

37:55.793 --> 37:59.413
- You all wanted revenge.
Well, now you got it.

38:03.137 --> 38:06.448
But there's a price
to pay for revenge.

38:06.517 --> 38:07.655
Now you gotta pay it.

38:53.344 --> 38:54.655
Sorry... to, uh...

38:54.724 --> 38:56.655
to bring that up at
the dinner table.

38:59.068 --> 39:01.172
- Well, there shouldn't be
things like that to discuss

39:01.241 --> 39:05.448
in the first place,
but that's life.

39:07.241 --> 39:11.482
In case you haven't noticed,
it is cruel and uncaring.

39:16.758 --> 39:20.137
You can't reason
with evil, son.

39:20.206 --> 39:22.103
Evil wants what it wants
and won't stop

39:22.172 --> 39:24.931
until it's won or you kill it.

39:27.206 --> 39:31.482
The only way to kill it
is to be meaner than evil.

39:34.931 --> 39:36.448
That's going to be
your last lesson, son:

39:36.517 --> 39:39.172
how to be meaner than evil

39:39.241 --> 39:42.758
and still love your family.

39:44.344 --> 39:46.137
And still enjoy a sunrise.

40:35.137 --> 40:36.448
- Why y'all dump them here?

40:36.517 --> 40:39.310
- 'Cause no one lives within
a hundred miles.

40:39.379 --> 40:43.172
It's a county with no people,
no sheriff,

40:43.241 --> 40:45.724
and no twelve jurors
of your peers.

41:15.034 --> 41:16.758
- So how many people
y'all dumped out there?

41:18.862 --> 41:21.620
- Everyone from
three states around

41:21.689 --> 41:24.000
dump their secrets
off that cliff.

41:26.793 --> 41:29.724
You want to know how
the west was won?

41:29.793 --> 41:32.724
The skeletons at the bottom
of that canyon is how.

41:35.448 --> 41:40.379
Now all you gotta do is figure
out how to not be one of them.
