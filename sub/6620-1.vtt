01:12.322 --> 01:17.744
His friends would say
"Stop whining." They've had enough of that

01:17.911 --> 01:22.331
His friends would say
"Stop pining, there's other girls to look at"

01:23.917 --> 01:28.713
They've tried to set him up
With Tiffany and Indigo

01:28.881 --> 01:34.844
But there's something about Mary
That they don't know

01:35.012 --> 01:37.722
Mary

01:38.348 --> 01:43.019
There's just something about Mary

01:46.064 --> 01:51.236
Well, his friends say
"Look, life's no fairy tale"

01:51.404 --> 01:56.700
That he should have some fun.
He's suffered long enough

01:56.868 --> 02:02.873
Well, they may know
About domestic and imported ale

02:03.041 --> 02:08.169
But they don't know a thing about love

02:08.463 --> 02:14.259
Well, his friends would say
He's dreaming and living in the past

02:14.427 --> 02:20.390
But they've never fallen in love
So his friends need not be asked

02:20.558 --> 02:27.564
His friends would say, "Be reasonable"
His friends would say, "Let go"

02:29.025 --> 02:35.906
But there's something about Mary
That they don't know

02:36.074 --> 02:38.367
Mary

02:39.244 --> 02:43.831
There's just something about Mary

02:54.634 --> 02:57.887
When I was 16 years old. I fell in love.

03:00.140 --> 03:01.182
Hey, Renise.

03:02.893 --> 03:04.352
Hey.

03:04.645 --> 03:06.688
So. what's up?

03:08.440 --> 03:09.857
Cool.

03:14.238 --> 03:20.201
So I was wondering, I don't know
if maybe you wanted to and... Or not.

03:20.369 --> 03:22.245
If you don't want to, you don't have to.

03:22.413 --> 03:25.540
I just wondered if maybe
you were going to the prom. And...

03:25.708 --> 03:30.920
Or if you felt like that,
maybe you'd wanna go with me.

03:31.088 --> 03:35.008
Or, I mean. whatever. If you didn't...

03:36.677 --> 03:39.095
Did you take that bio test?
Because that was, like...

03:39.263 --> 03:41.931
I heard this rumor that this guy I like
was gonna ask me...

03:42.099 --> 03:44.684
...so I'm gonna wait and see
what happens there.

03:46.020 --> 03:48.271
That sounds great. Yeah.

03:49.273 --> 03:50.940
Okay.

03:54.445 --> 03:58.865
- So is that, like, a yes or a no or?
- I thought I made it perfectly clear.

03:59.033 --> 04:01.701
If everything else falls apart...

04:02.077 --> 04:03.620
...maybe.

04:05.372 --> 04:07.625
I'm gonna hold you to that.

04:13.048 --> 04:16.132
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Mary.

04:19.095 --> 04:21.512
I wonder who she's going with.

04:24.768 --> 04:25.976
Her name was Mary.

04:26.144 --> 04:29.938
She moved to our little Rhode Island town
from Minnesota two years earlier.

04:32.651 --> 04:34.068
What a fox.

04:34.611 --> 04:37.196
I heard she's going
with some guy named Woogie.

04:38.823 --> 04:42.743
- Who?
- Big guy. Goes to Barrington High.

04:42.911 --> 04:46.955
Woogie from Bore-ington High?
Sounds like a loser.

04:47.499 --> 04:48.666
Loser?

04:48.833 --> 04:54.505
Woogie's only, like, all-state football
and basketball and fucking valedictorian.

04:54.673 --> 04:58.676
I heard he got a scholarship to Princeton,
but he's going to Europe first to model.

04:58.843 --> 05:02.471
Yeah? I was thinking of doing that.

05:03.556 --> 05:05.349
Sorry.

05:05.517 --> 05:07.643
Have you...? Have you seen my baseball?

05:07.811 --> 05:10.729
No, no. Sorry, man. Haven't seen it.

05:13.566 --> 05:15.067
Have you seen my baseball?

05:15.235 --> 05:16.820
- No.
- Sorry.

05:19.031 --> 05:21.032
Hey, check it out.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.867
Have you seen my baseball?

05:23.035 --> 05:27.872
Hey, buddy. Come here.
I think I know where your ball is.

05:28.874 --> 05:31.793
- You seen my baseball?
- Yeah, yeah. I seen it.

05:33.254 --> 05:35.505
You see that girl over there?

05:36.507 --> 05:39.759
She has it.
except she doesn't call it a baseball.

05:39.927 --> 05:42.303
She's got another name for it.

05:46.142 --> 05:48.143
Nice muffs.

05:49.520 --> 05:52.147
- Have you seen my wiener?
- What?

05:53.983 --> 05:55.567
Have you seen my wiener?

05:55.735 --> 05:58.903
- What the hell did you just say, buddy?
- Wiener?

05:59.071 --> 06:01.990
Get your hand off my car.
What the hell did you just say to me?

06:03.701 --> 06:04.993
My wiener.

06:05.619 --> 06:08.913
You fucking son of a bitch.
I'm gonna fucking kick your ass.

06:09.081 --> 06:12.167
- Come on, get up, fat boy. Let's go.
- Hey, Smokey, take it easy.

06:13.002 --> 06:15.211
- Who the fuck are you?
- The guy's not all there.

06:16.589 --> 06:19.299
Get out of my face. Come on.
You want the first punch?

06:19.467 --> 06:22.010
- Yeah! Fight, fight, fight!
- Fight, fight, fight!

06:22.511 --> 06:25.513
What's the matter with you? Stop it.

06:26.349 --> 06:29.268
- You okay, Warren?
- Mary, have you seen my baseball?

06:29.436 --> 06:30.978
No, I haven't seen your baseball.

06:31.146 --> 06:34.774
What are you doing leaving the yard?
You're not supposed to leave by yourself.

06:34.941 --> 06:36.776
- You know him?
- He's my brother.

06:36.943 --> 06:38.319
I'm her brother.

06:38.904 --> 06:41.197
- Warren.
- I didn't realize. you know?

06:41.364 --> 06:44.909
- You ought to tell him to watch his mouth.
- Jerk.

06:46.870 --> 06:51.040
- Are you okay?
- Oh. yeah, I'm fine.

06:51.666 --> 06:53.167
You okay?

06:55.796 --> 06:56.837
Thanks, Ted.

06:58.089 --> 07:00.299
I couldn't believe it. She knew my name.

07:00.467 --> 07:03.511
Some of my best friends
didn't know my name.

07:03.678 --> 07:07.640
I think that Joe Montana is, like.
the most underrated quarterback.

07:07.808 --> 07:10.142
I mean, he should've been
a first-round draft pick.

07:10.310 --> 07:14.021
Look what he did at Notre Dame.
It's so ridiculous.

07:14.189 --> 07:17.650
- Exactly.
- I'm telling you, this year, it's the 49ers.

07:17.818 --> 07:21.278
- 49ers.
- All the way.

07:22.239 --> 07:26.575
- Piggyback ride. Piggyback.
- Warren, stop it. Leave Ted alone.

07:26.743 --> 07:29.745
No, that's okay, I'll do it.
I mean, if you think he can hold me.

07:29.913 --> 07:33.541
Are you kidding me? He's 230 pounds.
He can hold you. You don't have to.

07:33.708 --> 07:37.254
No, it's okay. I got a little disc thing,
but it's all right. Here we go.

07:37.421 --> 07:39.798
Giddyup. Warren. There we go.

07:39.966 --> 07:43.927
- That's fun, huh. Warren?
- He's a real Clydesdale, isn't he?

07:44.095 --> 07:46.680
Yeah, Warren, bucking bronco. Okay.

07:46.848 --> 07:48.807
My turn now. My turn.

07:48.975 --> 07:52.853
- Okay, well. I don't...
- It's okay, Ted. You don't have to.

07:53.688 --> 07:56.481
- Giddyup. Giddyup.
- That's fun.

07:57.775 --> 08:00.360
That's fun, huh, Warren?

08:09.495 --> 08:11.663
That was fun.

08:11.956 --> 08:13.748
- He's only 230, huh?
- Yeah.

08:13.916 --> 08:17.544
- I'm in the yard now. I'll hide.
- Okay, go hide.

08:18.045 --> 08:19.629
- He's got a lot of energy.
- Yeah.

08:19.797 --> 08:23.008
- He's great. I have a lot of fun with him.
- Yeah.

08:24.093 --> 08:27.804
- Thanks for walking us back.
- Yeah, no problem.

08:28.556 --> 08:31.892
- I'm just gonna... I'm gonna...
- So are you going to the prom?

08:36.438 --> 08:39.649
- I think proms are dumb.
- I thought maybe we could go together.

08:40.234 --> 08:43.068
Oh, you're gonna go with, like,
a bunch of people, or?

08:43.236 --> 08:45.071
Yeah. If you want a designated driver...

08:45.239 --> 08:47.533
No, no. I mean you and me.

08:47.701 --> 08:50.912
Like, we could go together.
The two of us.

08:52.789 --> 08:55.583
- You and me?
- Yeah.

08:59.755 --> 09:02.256
Well, is that a yes or a no?

09:02.674 --> 09:05.676
- Sure. All right.
- Good.

09:06.219 --> 09:07.595
Cool.

09:07.763 --> 09:11.974
I'm gonna take Warren back inside.
I'll see you at school.

09:12.142 --> 09:14.477
- Bye.
- Cool. Catch you back at school.

09:16.146 --> 09:20.608
From that moment on, the guys at school
looked at me in a whole new light.

09:20.776 --> 09:22.735
You're a fucking liar.

09:22.903 --> 09:26.739
Do you expect us to believe
that you're going to the prom with Mary?

09:26.907 --> 09:29.283
What's so crazy about that?

09:29.451 --> 09:32.870
Oh, yeah, dirt bud,
and I'm going with Cyndi Lauper.

09:33.038 --> 09:36.624
- What happened to Woogie?
- She said she broke up with him.

09:36.792 --> 09:41.587
- That he was getting weird on her.
- I got 20 bucks that says you're full of shit.

09:41.755 --> 09:43.839
- Why not make it a hundred?
- Rock on.

09:44.007 --> 09:46.133
- I'm in.
- Me too.

10:08.324 --> 10:13.745
I've paid him enough money. I'm not paying
until the job gets done. He can kiss my ass.

10:14.205 --> 10:15.414
What the hell do you want?

10:22.338 --> 10:25.257
I'm Ted Stroehmann.
I'm here to take Mary to the prom.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.675
Prom?

10:26.843 --> 10:30.095
Mary went to the prom 20 minutes ago
with her boyfriend, Woogie.

10:30.263 --> 10:32.264
- Woogie?
- Woogie.

10:34.726 --> 10:36.143
I see.

10:38.312 --> 10:40.480
Charlie, you are so mean.

10:40.648 --> 10:44.735
This is Mary's stepfather, Charlie.
I'm Sheila, her mother.

10:44.902 --> 10:48.530
Ted, don't pay attention to anything
he says. He's a laugh a minute.

10:48.698 --> 10:49.990
That's very funny.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.368
I'm just having a little fun with the guy.
It's prom night.

10:53.536 --> 10:54.953
Woogie's got a sense of humor.

10:58.041 --> 10:59.958
Oh, hey. Hi, Warren.

11:00.126 --> 11:04.087
Listen, once he gets into that MTV,
he'll be there for quite a while.

11:05.883 --> 11:10.136
Here she comes.
Oh, honey. you look beautiful.

11:14.683 --> 11:18.061
Shit, look at that.
You better be careful. boy.

11:33.410 --> 11:35.036
Hi. Ted.

11:35.662 --> 11:39.624
Hi. Mary. You look really pretty.

11:39.792 --> 11:42.085
Thanks. I like your colors.

11:42.252 --> 11:45.922
Oh, thanks.
The guy said it was tan and taupe.

11:46.924 --> 11:49.967
Poor Ted's been getting it both barrels
from the wisenheimer here.

11:50.135 --> 11:52.929
Dad. you haven't been busting Ted's chops,
have you?

11:53.097 --> 11:56.099
I was just fucking with him, right, Ted?
You know.

11:57.392 --> 12:01.604
- Hey, Warren, did you say hi to Ted?
- About 10 times.

12:01.772 --> 12:02.855
Okay.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.900
Hey, Warren,
I think I found your baseball.

12:06.068 --> 12:09.237
- You've seen my baseball?
- Well, if it's a big white one?

12:12.407 --> 12:15.702
With little red stitching?

12:15.870 --> 12:16.912
Yup, it is.

12:17.080 --> 12:20.207
Then I think I saw it
right behind your ear.

12:22.210 --> 12:24.419
Warren, Warren, Warren. Hold it.

12:24.587 --> 12:27.131
Get up, boy. Hey. Warren.

12:28.133 --> 12:29.842
Be careful, man.

12:30.135 --> 12:31.760
- Get up. man.
- Warren.

12:31.928 --> 12:33.554
Let go of him. Get down from there.

12:33.721 --> 12:35.889
- Hey, Ted, what are you doing, man?
- Ted, Ted.

12:36.057 --> 12:37.808
Warren, put him down now.

12:38.893 --> 12:42.229
- What the hell are you doing?
- Here, here. Mary, come around here.

12:42.397 --> 12:43.814
This is my house, here.

12:43.982 --> 12:48.569
- Okay, sweetheart. okay.
- It's okay, Warren. It's okay. Here you go.

12:48.736 --> 12:51.905
- What's the matter with you?
- I was trying to give him the baseball.

12:52.073 --> 12:55.701
- Baseball? What baseball?
- I had a baseball. I know he likes baseball.

12:55.869 --> 12:58.328
- What baseball?
- There was a... It's right...

12:58.496 --> 13:00.122
There was a baseball here. I swear.

13:00.290 --> 13:04.168
I brought him a baseball.
and I was just trying to give him a present.

13:04.335 --> 13:07.045
- Are you yelling at me in my own house?
- No.

13:07.213 --> 13:09.631
Don't make me have to open
a can of whup-ass on you.

13:09.799 --> 13:12.801
Ted, I should have told you.
He has a thing about his ears.

13:13.303 --> 13:15.345
You all right. Warren?

13:16.014 --> 13:18.473
Honey, your strap's broken.

13:19.559 --> 13:20.684
You're right.

13:20.852 --> 13:23.312
Hey, Ted, I'm just gonna go upstairs
real quick. okay?

13:23.479 --> 13:24.689
I just need two minutes.

13:24.857 --> 13:27.692
- I gotta fix my dress.
- I'll help you, honey.

13:28.027 --> 13:30.528
- Yeah, yeah.
- Can I use your bathroom. sir?

13:30.696 --> 13:31.738
I've gotta...

13:31.906 --> 13:33.698
- He broke the table.
- Son of a bitch.

13:34.450 --> 13:37.285
- I didn't do it.
- It's all right. It's all right.

13:37.453 --> 13:39.787
- I swear there was...
- The bathroom is that way.

13:39.955 --> 13:40.997
- a baseball.

13:41.165 --> 13:44.876
Maybe I'll open up a can of whup-ass
on him.

13:45.044 --> 13:47.921
Trying to do the kid a favor.

14:21.080 --> 14:22.705
Is he looking at you? What is he...?

14:22.873 --> 14:25.041
- What is he doing down there?
- Oh. no. I...

14:25.292 --> 14:27.210
- No, no, I wasn't... I wasn't...
- Mom, wait.

14:27.378 --> 14:29.671
- Cover yourself. Cover yourself.
- Shit!

14:42.477 --> 14:47.439
- Ted, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Everything's okay.

14:47.607 --> 14:50.359
Okay. Okay, just take your time.
It's all right.

14:50.527 --> 14:53.028
You know, he's been in there
over a half an hour.

14:53.905 --> 14:56.031
Charlie, I think he's masturbating.

14:56.199 --> 14:57.992
- Oh, come on.
- Mom.

14:58.159 --> 14:59.785
He's not masturbating.

14:59.953 --> 15:02.663
He was watching you undress
with a silly grin on his face.

15:02.831 --> 15:05.332
No, I was watching the birds.

15:05.500 --> 15:07.418
- Do something.
- What do you want me to do?

15:07.585 --> 15:10.921
I think he needs some male help.

15:11.089 --> 15:15.134
- Oh. for crying out...
- No, Dad, just give him a minute.

15:15.302 --> 15:19.763
- Okay, kid. Listen, I'm coming in, okay?
- No, no. Don't.

15:19.931 --> 15:23.309
Now, exactly what the hell is the situation?
What, did you shit yourself?

15:23.476 --> 15:25.269
Oh, I wish.

15:26.271 --> 15:27.396
I got it stuck.

15:28.773 --> 15:29.857
You got what stuck?

15:30.775 --> 15:34.570
It.

15:34.988 --> 15:40.659
Well, listen, it's not the end of the world.
These kind of things happen.

15:41.369 --> 15:43.329
Let's have a look at it.

15:45.791 --> 15:47.584
Oh, for God and heaven's sake!

15:50.379 --> 15:51.921
- Quiet.
- Sheila.

15:52.089 --> 15:54.424
- No.
- Sheila, honey?

15:54.592 --> 15:55.967
Don't...

15:56.135 --> 15:59.929
Sheila. honey, you gotta come here.
You gotta see this.

16:00.097 --> 16:01.931
- What is it?
- What? No.

16:02.099 --> 16:04.559
- Come in here. honey.
- No. No, don't.

16:04.727 --> 16:07.937
Don't worry, she's a dental hygienist.
She'll know what to do.

16:08.105 --> 16:10.690
- Hi, Ted.
- Hi, Mrs. Jensen. How are you?

16:11.108 --> 16:13.360
- You okay?
- Yeah.

16:13.569 --> 16:15.111
Holy shit.

16:15.613 --> 16:17.947
- Charlie, you could have warned me.
- Keep it down.

16:18.115 --> 16:19.783
- Okay, I...
- I'm sorry, Mrs. Jensen.

16:19.950 --> 16:22.160
I don't want Mary to...
I don't want her to hear.

16:22.328 --> 16:24.204
Yeah. Let's just relax here, okay?

16:24.372 --> 16:30.377
Now, what exactly
are we looking at here?

16:30.753 --> 16:35.048
- What do you mean? What...?
- Well, I mean, is it the?

16:36.008 --> 16:37.592
Or the?

16:38.386 --> 16:40.303
- Is it the frank or the beans?
- Right.

16:42.181 --> 16:45.100
I don't know. It looks like...
I think it's a little bit of both.

16:45.267 --> 16:49.062
- Franks and beans. Franks and beans.
- Warren, quiet.

16:49.522 --> 16:52.941
- What's that bubble there?
- What do you think? It's a...

16:53.109 --> 16:56.612
Well, how the hell did you get the beans
above the frank? I mean...

16:56.780 --> 16:59.740
I don't know. It wasn't like
it was a well-thought-out plan.

16:59.908 --> 17:03.411
You know, there really does seem to be
a lot of skin coming through there...

17:03.578 --> 17:06.247
...so I'm gonna find some Bactine, honey.

17:06.415 --> 17:08.749
No. You know what?
I don't need any. Really.

17:08.916 --> 17:11.460
- Hello there.
- Oh, Christ.

17:11.627 --> 17:13.421
What the hell's going on here?

17:13.588 --> 17:18.467
- Neighbors said they heard a lady scream.
- Well, you're looking at him.

17:19.553 --> 17:21.554
You gotta take a look at this thing.

17:21.721 --> 17:25.307
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ain't it a beaut?

17:25.851 --> 17:29.979
What the hell were you thinking?

17:30.439 --> 17:33.441
How the hell did you get the zipper
all the way to the top?

17:33.775 --> 17:36.444
Well, let's just say the kid's limber.

17:38.447 --> 17:41.866
- Christ. What the...? God.
- You okay?

17:42.033 --> 17:45.035
Somebody's gonna have to move
that station wagon so I can get in.

17:45.203 --> 17:46.954
- Lenny, come here.
- Who...?

17:47.247 --> 17:51.250
Take a look at what this numbnuts did.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.627
Holy shit.

17:57.674 --> 18:00.801
Mike, Eddie, get down here quick.
Bring everybody. Bring a camera.

18:00.969 --> 18:03.471
You're not gonna believe this.
We got a kid down here...

18:03.639 --> 18:05.932
- What's your name?
- No, I...

18:06.100 --> 18:08.768
No, there's only one thing to do here.

18:09.312 --> 18:12.481
What? No. You know what? I got an idea.
Look. Look, I can just...

18:12.648 --> 18:16.401
We don't have to do anything. because,
look, I can just wear this over the front.

18:16.569 --> 18:19.779
- I can go to the prom, deal with it later.
- Son, relax.

18:19.947 --> 18:22.199
You already laid the tracks.
That's the hard part.

18:22.366 --> 18:23.950
Now we're just gonna back it up.

18:24.118 --> 18:26.328
Teddy, be brave.

18:26.537 --> 18:29.498
It's just like pulling off a Band-Aid.

18:30.875 --> 18:34.211
A one and a two...

18:34.378 --> 18:35.962
...and a...

18:36.130 --> 18:39.049
- We got a bleeder.
- Keep the pressure on it. Keep it on.

18:39.217 --> 18:41.384
Everybody get out of the way.

18:44.680 --> 18:47.974
- He was masturbating.
- People, please move out of the way.

18:48.142 --> 18:51.811
- Please, move. This is serious, people.
- He was masturbating.

18:51.979 --> 18:54.731
- Move out of the way.
- None of this ever happened to Woogie.

18:54.899 --> 18:57.150
Are you okay. Ted?

18:58.444 --> 19:01.530
- Ted.
- He was masturbating.

19:02.573 --> 19:06.284
- My God. are you all right?
- Killer.

19:11.040 --> 19:13.291
Okay. Okay, Ted.

19:13.460 --> 19:16.087
- Okay, let's roll.
- All right, folks, it's over. Go home.

19:16.255 --> 19:17.838
Let's go. It's over.

19:27.391 --> 19:31.102
So anyway,
school ended a couple of days later...

19:32.729 --> 19:36.190
...and her father
got transferred to Florida in July.

19:36.358 --> 19:40.778
So I worked all summer
to pay off those debts and...

19:41.780 --> 19:44.490
...well, I never saw Mary again.

19:45.576 --> 19:47.535
That was, what?

19:48.412 --> 19:52.873
- Thirteen years ago.
- Well, that's very interesting.

19:53.542 --> 19:57.211
Anyway, I know it's not the type of thing
you'd forget, but I guess I just...

19:57.379 --> 19:58.671
I kind of, you know...

19:58.839 --> 20:01.799
I must have blocked it out of my head
or something...

20:01.967 --> 20:04.427
...because I was driving down the highway
last week...

20:04.595 --> 20:08.931
...and I started thinking about Mary.
and all of a sudden...

20:09.099 --> 20:12.768
...it was like I couldn't breathe.
I mean, I was... I was...

20:12.936 --> 20:15.271
I felt like I was gonna die.

20:15.814 --> 20:19.442
So I pulled off the road
and I just sort of stopped in this...

20:19.610 --> 20:24.698
I guess it was a rest area.
I was just kind of shaking. and...

20:25.450 --> 20:29.244
You know,
rest areas are homosexual hangouts.

20:31.956 --> 20:33.457
Highway rest areas.

20:34.292 --> 20:39.463
They're the bathhouses of the '90s
for many, many, many gay men.

20:43.635 --> 20:45.969
So, what are you...?

20:47.513 --> 20:49.181
What are you saying?

20:52.477 --> 20:54.353
Time, she's up.

20:55.021 --> 20:58.231
We'll delve into that next week.

21:01.819 --> 21:02.986
He called you gay?

21:04.864 --> 21:07.240
Well, he implied it.

21:08.618 --> 21:11.536
Well, you know, you are a writer,
and writers are artists.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.914
And, you know, most artists are...

21:14.082 --> 21:17.834
...a little kind of... A little foofy.
A little, you know...

21:18.670 --> 21:20.712
Foofy and woofy?

21:23.007 --> 21:25.384
Let me ask you a question.
When you smoke a cigar...

21:25.551 --> 21:29.137
...do you ever pretend it has balls?
You know, like go:

21:29.806 --> 21:33.643
Well, I mean, I have.

21:34.019 --> 21:35.687
Haven't you?

21:39.191 --> 21:42.694
I'll tell you what. I'm gonna set you up
with my new assistant at work.

21:42.861 --> 21:44.404
You're gonna love her.

21:47.032 --> 21:49.659
I don't know.
Let's face it, Dom. I'm in a slump.

21:49.827 --> 21:52.578
I mean, lately I've been feeling like...

21:52.746 --> 21:54.247
Like...

21:55.165 --> 21:57.208
Like a loser.

22:00.379 --> 22:03.673
A loser?
What the hell are you talking about?

22:03.841 --> 22:08.094
Jesus, do you remember five years ago
when your kidneys failed?

22:08.262 --> 22:09.721
Now, if you were a loser...

22:09.888 --> 22:12.807
...would they have found a donor
with a tissue match so quickly?

22:12.975 --> 22:16.394
I don't think so. What are the odds
of that, one in a million? Jesus.

22:16.562 --> 22:19.439
Great. So I'm lucky because
my brother died in an explosion?

22:19.898 --> 22:23.901
I didn't say that. I said you're lucky
those kids found his kidneys.

22:24.528 --> 22:27.363
Look, your brother Jimmy
never gave a shit about you anyway.

22:30.409 --> 22:33.911
Look, come on, man, you're a real
glass-is-half-empty kind of guy.

22:34.079 --> 22:37.999
You, sir, have got a fucking guardian angel.
You come here.

22:38.333 --> 22:42.963
So I chili-dipped, three putt at the 18th.
I lost it six ways.

22:43.131 --> 22:44.923
- He's a lucky bastard.
- Yeah, well.

22:45.091 --> 22:48.761
Hey, guys. I thought you might like
some of these with your beers.

22:48.928 --> 22:52.097
- Yes, indeed. Ted, help yourself.
- I don't think I'm gonna have one.

22:52.265 --> 22:53.932
- Thanks, though.
- You don't want one?

22:54.100 --> 22:55.976
What do you want?
You want something else?

22:56.144 --> 22:58.437
- Come on. You want something to eat?
- Not hungry.

22:58.605 --> 23:02.566
You sure? You want a cookie? Something
like that? Honey, we got cookies?

23:02.734 --> 23:04.943
No, we don't, but, you know,
I could bake some.

23:05.111 --> 23:07.571
- No, no, no. Don't bake any.
- No, that's a good idea.

23:07.739 --> 23:11.200
- Bake some. Bake some Toll Houses.
- Oh, great. Yeah, yeah.

23:11.367 --> 23:14.828
- Chocolate chip or butterscotch?
- Let's go with the chocolate chip.

23:14.996 --> 23:17.998
- Really, you don't... It's...
- No, it's fine. Don't worry about it.

23:18.166 --> 23:20.542
- Really. She loves this kind of thing.
- Really?

23:20.710 --> 23:22.085
- Yeah.
- See, that's great.

23:22.253 --> 23:25.297
That's what I want.

23:25.799 --> 23:29.885
A family and somebody to, you know...

23:32.514 --> 23:35.349
It must be wonderful having all this.

23:36.267 --> 23:38.727
Each day is better than the next.

23:39.729 --> 23:43.273
How about you? The big L?

23:44.317 --> 23:45.984
- Ever been?
- What?

23:46.152 --> 23:47.653
In love.

23:48.279 --> 23:50.822
Well, once.

23:51.908 --> 23:52.951
Mary.

23:53.494 --> 23:55.912
Oh, God. Not Mary again.

23:56.080 --> 24:01.834
Look. I know it was brief,
but it was definitely love, Dom.

24:02.002 --> 24:04.837
I mean, crushes don't last
for 13 years, right?

24:05.548 --> 24:06.965
Whatever happened to Mary?

24:07.132 --> 24:09.551
Told you, she moved with her family
to Miami.

24:09.718 --> 24:11.052
So why don't you look her up?

24:11.595 --> 24:15.139
I did once. I called. She wasn't listed.

24:15.307 --> 24:18.101
So that's it? You get one bump in the road
and give up?

24:18.269 --> 24:20.770
Well, it's probably for the best.
After 13 years...

24:20.938 --> 24:22.939
...she's probably gonna think
I'm a stalker.

24:23.482 --> 24:26.109
You know what you should do?
Hire a private investigator.

24:26.277 --> 24:28.945
To find her, follow her around.
She won't know anything.

24:29.113 --> 24:31.739
No way. That's way too creepy.

24:31.907 --> 24:36.327
Besides, she's probably married with
a couple of kids by now. Girls like Mary...

24:36.996 --> 24:38.788
...they don't stay single.

24:39.540 --> 24:44.752
Hey, I've got an idea. There's this guy
down in my office. His name's Healy.

24:44.920 --> 24:47.505
He's a claims investigator.
He's a hell of a bloodhound.

24:47.673 --> 24:50.842
He shoots down to Miami
every couple of weeks. He can help you out.

24:51.010 --> 24:53.845
This guy runs a little hot,
but he gets the job done.

24:57.474 --> 24:59.017
So...

24:59.685 --> 25:03.856
...Dom tells me you're looking for
some lady friend you knew back at school.

25:04.024 --> 25:05.941
Yeah. Yeah.

25:06.109 --> 25:09.612
That's cute. I don't buy it, but it's cute.

25:10.697 --> 25:11.905
You're not buying what?

25:12.073 --> 25:16.660
Ted, I'm the kind of guy
who likes to shoot from the hip.

25:19.080 --> 25:21.290
I want you to level with me.

25:25.670 --> 25:29.798
Come on, let's talk.
Did you knock this skirt up?

25:30.216 --> 25:31.258
No.

25:31.718 --> 25:36.263
- She's blackmailing you, right?
- Blackmailing me? No.

25:36.931 --> 25:40.267
- You want her dead, don't you?
- Dead?

25:40.435 --> 25:42.978
Are you...? You're not serious, are you?

25:43.146 --> 25:46.523
You expect me to believe
this is a straight stalker case? Come on.

25:46.691 --> 25:49.610
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not a stalker.
I'm not a stalker, all right?

25:49.778 --> 25:52.029
- She's a friend of mine.
- Oh, sure she is.

25:52.197 --> 25:54.615
That explains why
she's got an unlisted number...

25:54.783 --> 25:57.159
...and you haven't heard squat from her
in 13 years.

25:57.327 --> 25:58.911
Yeah, real chum.

25:59.079 --> 26:02.122
- What...?
- You're good, Ted. Real piece of work.

26:02.290 --> 26:05.626
What are you...? You know what?
Forget it. Just forget the whole thing.

26:06.628 --> 26:07.920
Okay, I'll do it.

26:08.630 --> 26:12.634
But if this chick turns up with a toe tag,
I'm rolling over on you, big guy.

26:14.178 --> 26:15.720
All right.

26:33.239 --> 26:36.032
Healy, you dog.

26:36.659 --> 26:38.535
Sully. Look at you.

26:38.703 --> 26:41.663
You hot shit. You look fucking pisser.

26:41.831 --> 26:44.833
Hey. Hey, good fella.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.001
- Does he bite?
- A little bit.

26:47.169 --> 26:48.545
Get in.

26:51.674 --> 26:55.051
- Here's the info you asked for.
- Thanks.

26:55.219 --> 26:58.555
You know, you should thank me.
That girl was not easy to find.

26:58.723 --> 27:01.766
What, did she scam you
out of some insurance dough?

27:01.934 --> 27:06.521
No. Some guy gave me a couple bucks
to track down his high school girlfriend.

27:06.689 --> 27:08.481
Stalker, huh?

27:08.816 --> 27:11.276
Yep. Big time.

27:13.988 --> 27:16.948
You would not believe
all the pussy down here.

27:17.116 --> 27:19.701
It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

27:19.869 --> 27:22.037
- Yeah? You getting any?
- Nothing.

27:24.541 --> 27:26.500
There you go.

27:28.211 --> 27:30.838
- Hey, shoes off.
- What the...?

27:31.923 --> 27:34.049
Are you kidding me?

27:35.218 --> 27:38.220
You... You are so full of...
Look at this place.

27:38.388 --> 27:40.389
- Yeah, I'm doing okay.
- Doing okay?

27:40.557 --> 27:42.892
I gotta get ready for work.

27:43.727 --> 27:46.437
This pad, those killer wheels.

27:46.605 --> 27:49.106
Man, it looks like
you really cleaned up your act.

27:49.274 --> 27:52.693
Yeah, what can I tell you?
It's a healthier lifestyle down here.

27:52.861 --> 27:56.447
It's easier to succeed, you know.
when your head is clear.

27:56.615 --> 28:00.284
- Yeah.
- Those guys back in Boston?

28:00.911 --> 28:03.496
Oh, fucking animals.

28:05.415 --> 28:09.960
Hey, what do you say we go out and grab
a couple of pops before you go to work?

28:10.796 --> 28:14.173
None for me, buddy.
I don't drink anymore.

28:14.341 --> 28:17.551
Yeah, you don't drink any less, right?

28:20.138 --> 28:21.764
What the...?

28:24.267 --> 28:27.019
That's Bill.
Don't worry. I fed him last week.

28:28.396 --> 28:30.981
- Does he bite?
- Nips.

28:38.533 --> 28:41.451
Nineteen months I've been straight.

28:42.411 --> 28:45.080
Is that right? Good for you. Sully.

28:45.623 --> 28:49.793
Yeah, it was hard at first,
but I'm there, I'm there.

28:50.127 --> 28:52.671
Hey, I'm proud of you.
How about a frosty to celebrate?

28:53.631 --> 28:55.632
Didn't you hear what I just said?

28:57.051 --> 29:00.053
Sully, you were never an alky.
You were a cokehead.

29:00.221 --> 29:04.140
Yeah, but when you quit the nose candy,
you gotta quit the booze too.

29:04.308 --> 29:08.728
Who told you that? Sully, it's one...
It's a lite beer.

29:09.689 --> 29:12.190
Oh, the big, bad beer's gonna get you.

29:14.652 --> 29:17.153
- It's you I'm worried about.
- You're worried about me?

29:17.321 --> 29:20.615
Yeah. You gotta bend a little bit,
or believe me. you're gonna break.

29:20.783 --> 29:23.159
- You think?
- Oh, yeah.

29:23.995 --> 29:27.914
You gotta learn to have a pop once in
a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon.

29:28.082 --> 29:30.250
You're being a fanatic.

29:31.752 --> 29:34.170
Well, jeez...

29:34.338 --> 29:37.841
...I don't wanna fall off the wagon.
- No.

29:39.093 --> 29:42.805
- I mean, not after 19 months.
- Exactly.

29:56.695 --> 30:00.781
Jesus, you know what? This shit
doesn't even taste good to me anymore.

30:00.949 --> 30:03.618
Fuck you then, you big pussy.
I'll drink it.

30:30.437 --> 30:32.980
Looks like we found your Mary, Ted.

30:33.231 --> 30:35.816
Husband: negative.

30:36.526 --> 30:39.946
Children and a Labrador: negative.

30:40.113 --> 30:44.325
Tight little package: affirmative.

30:52.085 --> 30:53.335
Good morning, Magda.

30:54.087 --> 30:56.171
- Hi, doll. You're in my light.
- Sorry.

30:58.383 --> 31:02.094
- So you've been out here all night again?
- Bet your ass I have.

31:02.261 --> 31:04.805
This is an important job,
neighborhood watch is.

31:05.431 --> 31:07.724
Neighborhood watch.
Is that what we're calling it?

31:07.892 --> 31:11.436
Listening to perfect strangers'
telephone conversations.

31:12.772 --> 31:15.774
This only picks up cellular phones
in a half-a-mile radius.

31:16.818 --> 31:17.859
Meaning?

31:18.027 --> 31:21.780
These are the people you live amongst.
You got a right to know if they're creeps.

31:21.948 --> 31:25.117
For instance, do you know the guy
in the green house down the street?

31:25.284 --> 31:26.326
Yeah.

31:26.494 --> 31:28.120
Cheating on his wife.

31:28.788 --> 31:32.708
And I am not surprised.
I am not surprised at all...

31:32.875 --> 31:35.919
...because Puffy used to bark his balls off
whenever he saw him.

31:36.087 --> 31:39.297
And you know that Puffy,
he only barks at the bad people.

31:40.174 --> 31:41.758
Okay.

31:42.260 --> 31:45.929
Well, I'm gonna go hit some golf balls
and hook up with Warren...

31:46.305 --> 31:47.597
...so try to get some sleep.

31:47.765 --> 31:51.143
- Okay. Bye, doll.
- May I make a suggestion?

31:51.310 --> 31:54.813
Try not drinking so early in the morning
because you smell like a gin mill.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.984
I smell like a gin mill?

32:00.988 --> 32:04.824
Does Mommy?
Does Mommy smell like a gin mill?

32:10.748 --> 32:12.582
Hello.

32:19.923 --> 32:22.675
Hey, Herb. How's it going?
Apple for you today.

32:22.843 --> 32:24.177
Thanks, Mary.

32:24.344 --> 32:27.555
- Have a good day. See you later.
- Looking good, honey.

32:58.295 --> 33:00.755
- Hi, Mary.
- Hey, Mrs. Bailey. How you doing?

33:01.423 --> 33:03.257
Looks like we got a jock on our hands.

33:10.433 --> 33:13.185
- Here, you want the sports page?
- Thank you.

33:14.062 --> 33:16.772
- Take care now.
- Bye, guys. See you.

33:39.420 --> 33:41.463
Yeah. Remember, I have two. Mary.

33:41.631 --> 33:45.050
Yeah. You can have two halves.
just like everybody else.

33:45.218 --> 33:47.094
Yeah, that's good.

33:48.638 --> 33:50.931
- Will you marry me. Mary?
- I would love to, Jimmy.

33:51.099 --> 33:54.935
But I'm already engaged to Freddie.

33:55.770 --> 33:58.772
- Who's Freddie? Me?
- Yes, you.

33:59.274 --> 34:01.066
Will you marry me?

34:02.235 --> 34:05.404
What about Dolores?
You gonna marry us both?

34:05.572 --> 34:07.197
I'm gonna kiss you.

34:07.490 --> 34:10.492
I think you're making out
pretty well there. Okay.

34:11.661 --> 34:14.621
- Thanks, Mary.
- You're welcome, Zack.

34:15.165 --> 34:17.206
- No onions.
- No onions.

34:17.375 --> 34:19.418
No onions. How are you doing?

34:21.755 --> 34:23.255
Listen to this one.

34:23.424 --> 34:27.467
"Seeking sensitive Wasp doctor
to share candlelit dinners...

34:27.636 --> 34:30.304
...long walks in Coconut Grove,
marriage."

34:30.472 --> 34:33.808
Is she looking for a corpse?
You have to be specific when you write.

34:33.976 --> 34:38.228
You have to say
"Seeking deaf-mute with, you know...

34:38.397 --> 34:40.315
...3-pound cock and trust fund."

34:43.402 --> 34:46.571
I want a guy who can play 36 holes
and still have enough energy...

34:46.739 --> 34:49.364
...to take me and Warren to a ball game
and eat hot dogs.

34:49.533 --> 34:53.328
I'm talking sausage hot dogs, beer.
Not lite beer, but beer.

34:53.495 --> 34:54.786
That's my ad. Print it up.

34:56.581 --> 34:59.751
A fatty who likes beer and golf.

34:59.919 --> 35:02.837
Jeez, Mary.
where are you gonna find a gem like that?

35:04.548 --> 35:07.091
Okay, well, here's the catch.

35:07.343 --> 35:09.302
He has to be self-employed.

35:09.678 --> 35:10.720
Like a drug dealer?

35:12.097 --> 35:17.393
No, I was thinking along the lines, maybe,
of somebody like an architect or something.

35:17.561 --> 35:20.855
But I want somebody
with freedom in their job, you know?

35:21.023 --> 35:25.235
Somebody who can do it anywhere
and just leave at a drop of a hat.

35:25.402 --> 35:29.405
And where would you
and your beer-bellied architect be going to?

35:30.075 --> 35:31.533
- The Super Bowl?
- Yeah.

35:31.910 --> 35:32.952
That's good.

35:33.119 --> 35:35.287
I don't know.
Maybe a few months in Nepal.

35:35.455 --> 35:36.705
Nepal.

35:36.873 --> 35:39.959
And you'd probably dump the poor guy
halfway to Katmandu.

35:40.627 --> 35:41.961
What's that supposed to mean?

35:42.128 --> 35:45.047
- It means you change your mind too much.
- No, I don't.

35:45.215 --> 35:46.382
Come off it, Mary.

35:46.549 --> 35:49.093
Remember that gorgeous,
corn-fed white boy, honey...

35:49.261 --> 35:51.804
...that you just dumped
like yesterday's garbage?

35:51.972 --> 35:53.472
What was his name? Pack man.

35:55.100 --> 35:58.060
Okay, we had fun for a while.

35:58.228 --> 36:01.522
Mary, cut the crap.
What really happened with Brett?

36:01.690 --> 36:03.899
Yeah. Brett seemed so sweet.

36:05.402 --> 36:08.570
You know what Tucker said
Brett told him?

36:09.072 --> 36:11.240
He said that if Warren wasn't in my life...

36:11.408 --> 36:14.076
...that he would have popped the question
a long time ago.

36:15.036 --> 36:17.079
- Oh, man.
- What a shock.

36:17.622 --> 36:20.541
To hell with Brett, you know?

36:21.876 --> 36:23.961
I've got a vibrator.

36:31.219 --> 36:34.138
- Hello?
- Hello?

36:34.305 --> 36:37.307
- Sully?
- Hello?

36:38.101 --> 36:41.604
- Sully, is that you?
- May I ask who's calling, please?

36:41.772 --> 36:45.400
Sully, it's me, Healy.
What's going on over there?

36:45.568 --> 36:49.654
Fucking Patrick Healy.
You think your shit don't stink.

36:49.822 --> 36:51.489
Well, I got news for you.

36:51.657 --> 36:54.784
You're goddamn right it don't.

36:55.327 --> 36:58.121
Hey, I wanna thank you for the other day.

36:58.289 --> 37:01.666
You really helped me. You were right.

37:01.834 --> 37:03.752
Hold, please.

37:06.756 --> 37:08.465
I haven't even wanted a beer.

37:09.300 --> 37:11.176
- How are you, buddy?
- I'm fine.

37:11.343 --> 37:15.972
I just wanted to let you know I'll have
your car back to you in a couple hours.

37:16.140 --> 37:19.309
- I'm still staking out this broad's apartment.
- Hey.

37:19.477 --> 37:24.314
Well, you were right.
I was uptight. I was...

37:24.857 --> 37:26.608
...tight.

37:27.234 --> 37:31.154
You know who I miss?
Those guys in Boston.

37:35.159 --> 37:37.035
Hold on a sec.

37:52.344 --> 37:55.221
Those are the plays of the month.
Thank you for joining us.

37:55.388 --> 38:00.351
Look forward to seeing you next Sunday
on The Sports Machine. Have a good week.

38:11.029 --> 38:13.364
Oh, yeah.

38:14.950 --> 38:16.742
Here comes the money shot.

38:26.378 --> 38:28.712
First chink in the armor, Ted.

38:33.844 --> 38:35.386
Shit.

38:37.848 --> 38:40.182
Oh, yeah.

38:48.024 --> 38:50.568
Pop, you wanna get me a whiskey sour
when you get a sec?

38:50.735 --> 38:51.777
Whiskey sour
coming up.

38:51.945 --> 38:55.531
- I got some excellent news for you.
- Oh, yeah? Excellent?

38:55.699 --> 38:59.786
- I think your life's about to change.
- Really? So you found her?

38:59.954 --> 39:06.418
Oh, yeah. And you were right, man.
She really is something else. My God.

39:06.586 --> 39:11.089
Really? So she hasn't changed at all. huh?

39:11.841 --> 39:16.052
Well, that I couldn't say.
Let me ask you something.

39:17.221 --> 39:19.973
Was Mary a little big-boned
back in high school?

39:20.141 --> 39:23.727
Big-boned? No, no, not at all. No.

39:24.061 --> 39:26.688
I guess she packed on a few pounds
over the years.

39:27.106 --> 39:29.524
Oh, yeah? So she's a little...?
She's a little chubby?

39:29.692 --> 39:32.444
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half.
Not bad.

39:34.030 --> 39:35.947
My. A deuce and a half, huh?

39:36.115 --> 39:38.533
Well, you know,
you shit out a bunch of kids...

39:38.701 --> 39:41.161
...and you're bound to put on
a few pounds.

39:41.495 --> 39:43.997
So she's...? She's married?

39:44.165 --> 39:46.750
No, no, she's never been.
That's the good news.

39:47.543 --> 39:48.877
Yeah.

39:49.045 --> 39:52.380
Four kids, three different guys,
but no rock.

39:52.548 --> 39:54.299
Hyperactive little fuckers too.

39:54.467 --> 39:57.469
Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair,
I bet.

39:57.970 --> 40:01.014
She's in a wheelchair?
Mary's in a wheelchair?

40:01.641 --> 40:03.558
I thought that was part of your kick.

40:03.726 --> 40:06.311
- Excuse me, I ordered a whiskey sour.
- Yeah, whatever.

40:06.479 --> 40:09.315
Are you sure it's the same Mary?
You got the right person?

40:09.483 --> 40:12.485
Oh, yeah. It's Mary, all right.
The brother, Warren?

40:13.487 --> 40:15.154
Hey, don't look so shocked, Ted.

40:15.322 --> 40:20.368
It's been a long time. I bet you've changed
a lot over the last 13 years, haven't you?

40:20.535 --> 40:24.997
- What, do you think your shit don't stink?
- No, I don't think... I mean, yesm it doe...

40:25.165 --> 40:27.667
- I don't...
- Okay, I got all the information you need.

40:27.834 --> 40:30.169
I got it off her bookie. Nice guy.

40:30.671 --> 40:34.507
You really should look her up, Ted.
I mean, she's a real spark plug, this one.

40:34.675 --> 40:38.302
Well, thank you.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.

40:38.470 --> 40:42.890
Ted, don't you want the name
of the housing project?

40:44.935 --> 40:46.435
What?

40:46.603 --> 40:47.645
- for 1995.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.273
See the Sarone boys
on Route 1 in South Brattleboro...

40:50.440 --> 40:54.068
...and right here on Jefferson Boulevard
in Warwick, you'll be...

41:07.958 --> 41:11.127
Well, it hurts from the bottom

41:11.295 --> 41:14.672
And it hurts down to your soul

41:14.840 --> 41:18.802
That's because true love is not nice

41:21.431 --> 41:23.974
And it brings up hurt

41:24.142 --> 41:27.644
From when you were 5 years old

41:27.812 --> 41:31.732
That's because true love is not nice

41:31.899 --> 41:33.525
No

41:34.527 --> 41:38.363
Oh, pain. pain. pain

41:38.531 --> 41:41.575
Ain't that just love's name?

41:41.743 --> 41:47.122
Love can bring up hurt
From way down low

41:48.041 --> 41:51.251
It now be emphasized

41:51.419 --> 41:55.297
True love is just not civilized

41:55.465 --> 41:57.841
True love is not nice

41:58.009 --> 41:59.968
No, no

42:06.934 --> 42:08.435
Where are you going?

42:09.812 --> 42:13.940
- Oh. I resigned.
- Good luck in Miami, Pat.

42:14.108 --> 42:17.986
Miami? What are you doing in Miami?

42:18.780 --> 42:21.239
I took a job offer.

42:21.407 --> 42:22.949
With who?

42:23.368 --> 42:26.787
With Rice-a-Roni.

42:27.080 --> 42:30.124
Isn't that the San Francisco treat?

42:30.292 --> 42:32.043
It was.

42:32.753 --> 42:35.213
- They're changing their image.
- Yeah, well, listen.

42:35.381 --> 42:37.799
- I've been thinking about what you said.
- Good, good.

42:37.966 --> 42:41.302
And I still wanna look her up.

42:41.470 --> 42:45.181
Who? Roller pig? Are you nuts?

42:45.349 --> 42:48.810
I thought you said
she was a real spark plug.

42:48.977 --> 42:52.772
No, no, I said butt plug. She's heinous.

42:55.818 --> 42:58.820
You know what?
All the same. I think I wanna call her.

42:58.987 --> 43:01.072
I mean, I know it sounds crazy...

43:01.240 --> 43:03.491
...but, I don't know.
maybe I can help her out.

43:03.659 --> 43:07.453
I feel bad, you know. The poor thing.
she's in a wheelchair for God's sakes.

43:07.621 --> 43:12.291
- It's a bunion. It'll heal.
- Bunion? You... I thought...

43:12.459 --> 43:15.086
You know what? That's not even it.
The point is, I just...

43:15.254 --> 43:20.883
I know this doesn't make sense to you,
but I can't just turn it off that fast.

43:23.345 --> 43:26.556
I guess I still have feelings for her.

43:27.683 --> 43:30.518
This girl really means something
to you, huh?

43:34.815 --> 43:36.190
All right.

43:36.817 --> 43:38.402
Tell you what.

43:39.696 --> 43:42.448
I'll get you her number
as soon as she gets back from Japan.

43:42.615 --> 43:44.783
Thank you, I appreciate...

43:44.951 --> 43:49.037
Japan? What's happening in Japan?
Why is she going to Japan?

43:50.081 --> 43:52.541
You've heard of mail-order brides,
haven't you?

43:52.709 --> 43:56.003
- Well, they go that way too.
- Mary's a?

43:56.337 --> 43:58.505
What are they, desperate? She's a whale.

43:58.673 --> 44:03.010
Don't forget, it's a sumo culture.
They pay by the pound there.

44:04.512 --> 44:06.221
Sort of like tuna.

44:07.724 --> 44:09.725
What happened to...?
You said she was single.

44:09.893 --> 44:13.937
- Remember, no rock?
- You had your window, Ted. You blew it.

44:16.816 --> 44:18.859
I had my window?

44:20.862 --> 44:24.907
I'm sorry, buddy. It's just, you know,
you're taking this all wrong.

44:25.074 --> 44:28.619
Okay? I mean, come on, you're liberated.
I feel liberated.

44:28.786 --> 44:32.372
I mean, you're in therapy thinking
you blew it with the greatest girl ever...

44:32.540 --> 44:35.584
...and it turns out that getting your dick
stuck in your zipper...

44:35.752 --> 44:37.961
...was the best thing
that ever happened to you.

44:38.129 --> 44:41.381
- Say it a little louder?
- I'm sorry, but it was.

44:42.842 --> 44:44.927
I never told you that.

44:45.970 --> 44:48.681
Christ, Ted. I was only four towns away.

44:48.933 --> 44:51.559
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sure, sweetheart.

44:51.727 --> 44:52.852
Oh, man, I gotta go.

44:53.020 --> 44:56.773
I gotta get up at 6 a.m. and help
my boss's brother move into his apartment.

44:56.941 --> 45:01.027
- Your boss's brother? Who's that?
- I don't even know. I never met him.

45:01.195 --> 45:04.447
Ted, you gotta finish that novel
so you can quit that stupid magazine.

45:04.615 --> 45:05.782
Yeah.

45:11.956 --> 45:13.831
Nice swing.

45:21.382 --> 45:23.216
Christ, hit a house.

45:24.260 --> 45:26.135
I haven't swung the wrenches in a while.

45:31.517 --> 45:34.018
Would you mind giving me
some pointers here?

45:35.271 --> 45:38.231
Yeah, sure.
Don't talk in someone's backswing.

45:39.233 --> 45:40.942
Oh, thanks.

45:42.152 --> 45:45.321
- I'm gonna go get a soda. You want one?
- No, thanks.

45:49.159 --> 45:53.204
Look. I'm sorry to bother you again,
but you got change of a dollar?

45:54.206 --> 45:55.248
No.

45:56.125 --> 45:58.627
All I got are these damn Nepalese coins.

46:02.632 --> 46:04.341
You've been to Nepal?

46:07.512 --> 46:09.179
Not in months.

46:09.347 --> 46:11.932
I don't even know why
I bought the damn place.

46:18.315 --> 46:23.027
- Nice meeting you again.
- You too, again.

46:25.530 --> 46:26.739
So, what's your name?

46:27.866 --> 46:29.700
Pat Healy.

46:32.579 --> 46:33.996
Wanna know mine?

46:35.040 --> 46:37.041
I already know it, Mary.

46:38.627 --> 46:39.710
How'd you know that?

46:40.754 --> 46:43.380
Because it's right there on your golf bag.

46:50.472 --> 46:51.889
Damn.

46:52.599 --> 46:55.267
Wow, are those blueprints?

46:55.435 --> 47:00.397
Oh, these? They're just some projects
I'm working on.

47:00.565 --> 47:03.942
Museum, hospital for kids.

47:04.110 --> 47:05.778
Really? Are you an architect?

47:06.404 --> 47:09.658
Just till I get my PGA tour card.

47:10.534 --> 47:15.830
No, I mean, are they putting up
some sort of a new museum in town, or?

47:15.998 --> 47:19.501
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm sort of burnt-out on talking about it.

47:19.669 --> 47:21.753
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:21.921 --> 47:24.339
It's just a job, really.
Something to keep me moving.

47:24.840 --> 47:28.677
- My real passion is my hobby.
- Really? What's that?

47:29.178 --> 47:30.929
I work with retards.

47:33.015 --> 47:36.017
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?

47:36.185 --> 47:38.353
Well, the hell with that.

47:38.521 --> 47:41.940
No one's gonna tell me
who I can and can't work with, right?

47:42.108 --> 47:45.735
- No, I mean...
- We got this one kid, Mongo.

47:45.903 --> 47:49.114
He's got a forehead like
a drive-in movie theater. He's a good shit...

47:49.281 --> 47:51.157
...so we don't bust his chops too much.

47:51.325 --> 47:55.120
- So one day, Mongo gets out of his cage...
- What, they keep him in a cage?

47:55.579 --> 47:58.623
- Well, it's just an enclosure.
- No, but they keep him confined?

47:58.791 --> 48:00.834
- Right, yeah.
- That's bullshit.

48:01.001 --> 48:02.293
Well, that's what I said.

48:02.461 --> 48:05.505
- So I went out and I got him a leash.
- A leash?

48:05.673 --> 48:09.968
Yeah, one you can hook on to the
clothesline and he can run back and forth...

48:10.136 --> 48:15.682
...and there's plenty of room
for him to dig and play.

48:15.850 --> 48:19.270
That kid has really...
He's really blossomed, you know?

48:19.438 --> 48:21.897
Now I can take him to movies...

48:23.358 --> 48:24.483
...baseball games.

48:24.651 --> 48:26.652
You know, fun stuff.

48:27.529 --> 48:30.072
- Yeah.
- Sounds cool.

48:30.240 --> 48:33.576
Oh, yeah, it's cool for them.
but for me, it's much more than that.

48:33.744 --> 48:36.871
For me, it's heaven, you know?

48:37.080 --> 48:41.542
Those goofy bastards are just about
the best thing I've got going in this...

48:42.544 --> 48:44.128
...crazy world.

48:47.591 --> 48:50.843
Hey, dipshit,
be careful with that thing, will you?

48:51.344 --> 48:53.763
- What?
- You heard me.

48:53.930 --> 48:56.932
You already put a fucking nick
in my piano.

48:57.100 --> 49:00.186
Well, I'll try to be a little more careful.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.397
What, are you fading?
You wimping out on me?

49:03.565 --> 49:06.901
It's just that this is a little bit heavy,
that's all.

49:07.068 --> 49:10.321
Heavy? What I wouldn't give
to know what heavy feels like...

49:10.489 --> 49:12.072
...you insensitive prick.

49:12.699 --> 49:16.327
- No, I didn't mean that.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm going down the street...

49:16.495 --> 49:18.746
...to get coffee.
- Wait. I'll get you the coffee.

49:20.081 --> 49:21.624
Could you just...? Hey, I'm sorry.

49:35.264 --> 49:37.057
Hey, you!

49:37.225 --> 49:40.101
You with the furniture. Hey.

49:40.770 --> 49:43.772
- I'm Steve Tyler with The Troubleshooters.
- Oh, yeah. Hey.

49:43.940 --> 49:46.525
Do you know your truck
is parked in a handicapped zone?

49:46.692 --> 49:49.903
- Oh, it's okay. The guy who...
- You don't look very handicapped to me.

49:50.071 --> 49:53.907
- Why would you do something like that?
- I'm not handicapped, but the guy who has...

49:54.075 --> 49:57.410
Are you getting this?
Make sure you get a close-up on his face.

49:57.578 --> 50:00.413
There's a handicapped guy,
he's got an electric wheelchair.

50:00.581 --> 50:04.376
There's a disabled schmuck who's
in a wheelchair. He's coming back.

50:08.756 --> 50:12.425
Tender fascial tissue left of L7.

50:14.262 --> 50:16.012
Hey, Bob?

50:16.556 --> 50:18.598
Remember Mary?

50:19.100 --> 50:21.101
Oh, yeah.

50:21.435 --> 50:23.603
I remember Mary.

50:24.397 --> 50:28.149
Hey, I saw her a couple months ago
at a convention in Las Vegas.

50:28.901 --> 50:30.652
How could you see her at a convention?

50:30.820 --> 50:33.572
Well, I'm a chiropractor.
she's an orthopedic surgeon.

50:33.739 --> 50:35.282
She's a what?

50:35.449 --> 50:40.830
She's an orthopedic surgeon.
and... she's still a fox.

50:42.708 --> 50:45.167
What if the families
don't want a class action?

50:45.836 --> 50:49.380
God, that's what I've been trying to explain
to you people for the last hour.

50:49.548 --> 50:52.008
Okay. fine, we'll go over it again. I...

50:52.175 --> 50:53.175
Mary's a fox.

50:53.343 --> 50:54.719
- What?
- What?

50:54.887 --> 50:56.971
Mary's a fox? What are you...?

50:57.139 --> 51:01.434
Folks, here, let's... We'll break up.
We'll spitball this tomorrow, okay?

51:02.853 --> 51:05.938
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Mary? My Mary?

51:06.106 --> 51:09.066
She's not in Japan.
She has no rug rats running around.

51:09.234 --> 51:12.820
My friend says she's a fox.
A surgeon fox.

51:12.988 --> 51:15.239
I don't get it. I don't know what you're...
Healy...

51:15.407 --> 51:18.034
Think about it.
He never even looked her up down there.

51:18.201 --> 51:22.288
He was there closing his deal
with the Rice-a-Roni people the whole time.

51:25.709 --> 51:27.251
What's up with your head?

51:27.419 --> 51:31.213
Oh, I get hives
tap-dancing for these idiots.

51:31.381 --> 51:33.424
I get a little stressed out.

51:33.592 --> 51:37.720
Jeez, you know. I feel like a royal shit
because I set you up with this guy.

51:40.057 --> 51:42.433
You know what you gotta do.
You gotta call her.

51:43.060 --> 51:46.730
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.

51:46.898 --> 51:50.484
Yeah. Yeah, okay. ASAP.

51:51.235 --> 51:52.736
So who's the lucky guy?

51:54.030 --> 51:57.532
His name's Pat.
Met him at the driving range.

51:58.284 --> 51:59.326
Is he good-looking?

52:00.954 --> 52:02.829
He's no Steve Young.

52:03.706 --> 52:04.998
So, what is he like?

52:06.292 --> 52:07.918
I don't know.

52:08.419 --> 52:10.587
Kind of a mook. A schlep.

52:10.755 --> 52:12.923
Why the hell are you going out
with a schlep?

52:13.091 --> 52:18.470
It's not like that, Magda. You know.
it's like that movie Harold and Maude.

52:19.597 --> 52:20.847
I don't watch the new ones.

52:21.015 --> 52:24.685
Well, you should because it's probably
the greatest love story of our time.

52:24.852 --> 52:29.690
The point is,
is that love isn't about money...

52:29.857 --> 52:32.526
...or social standings or age.

52:32.694 --> 52:36.780
It's about two people connecting,
having something in common.

52:36.948 --> 52:39.157
You know, kindred spirits.

52:39.325 --> 52:42.786
Fuck kindred spirits.
My little Puffy here is gonna tell you...

52:42.954 --> 52:46.456
...everything you need to know
about that guy in about two seconds flat.

52:46.624 --> 52:49.751
If Puffy starts yapping, he's a loser.

52:49.919 --> 52:54.464
If he likes him, honey,
then you've got yourself a keeper.

53:19.950 --> 53:25.413
Yeah, Pufferball likes it
when I rub his belly.

53:26.165 --> 53:28.374
That is amazing.

53:28.542 --> 53:33.254
He doesn't like anybody.
He never usually likes guys.

53:33.422 --> 53:37.008
- He doesn't like bad guys.
- Is that right?

53:37.176 --> 53:39.719
He can tell that you're an animal nut.

53:40.012 --> 53:43.347
- You are, aren't you?
- You got me pegged.

53:43.515 --> 53:47.977
You know, in Nepal.
the villagers there called me kin ton ti...

53:48.645 --> 53:53.858
...which means
"noble man who is loved by many animal...

53:54.026 --> 53:56.944
...who, in kind, he loveth too."

53:58.864 --> 54:01.074
Would you like a cup of tea
or something?

54:01.241 --> 54:03.868
I'd love a brewski if you got one.

54:04.036 --> 54:05.536
We can do that.

54:05.705 --> 54:09.208
Hey, Magda.
why don't you help me in the kitchen?

54:09.918 --> 54:12.503
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Certainly, of course.

54:18.968 --> 54:21.929
Puffer doesn't like bad guys, does he?

54:24.724 --> 54:29.436
Puffer?

54:30.897 --> 54:32.564
Puffer, come on, boy.

54:32.732 --> 54:35.109
Would you like a little clam dip, doll?

54:35.276 --> 54:38.153
No, thank you.
I'd love a Bundt cake if you have one.

54:39.906 --> 54:41.198
- Bundt cake?
- Bundt cake?

54:41.366 --> 54:48.747
One, two. three. four. five.

54:49.415 --> 54:50.457
One, two. three...

54:50.625 --> 54:55.504
Hey, Pat, do you want a Budweiser
or a Heinie?

54:55.672 --> 54:57.089
Yeah, whatever.

54:57.257 --> 54:59.633
Come on, Puffer.
Stay away from the light.

55:02.053 --> 55:03.762
Okay, I'll just get you a regular.

55:33.961 --> 55:35.336
All set?

55:43.345 --> 55:44.679
Good pooch.

55:45.222 --> 55:48.892
All we had were some Oreos.
How does that sound, honey?

55:50.144 --> 55:53.146
Oh, my God.

55:53.814 --> 55:57.525
He's got him wrapped up like a baby.

55:58.027 --> 56:00.987
He was... He was a little chilly.

56:04.491 --> 56:05.658
Well, here we are.

56:05.826 --> 56:06.868
- The museum?
- Yeah.

56:07.036 --> 56:10.163
- I thought we were going to dinner.
- We will, but I have a surprise.

56:10.331 --> 56:13.249
- A surprise?
- Yeah, it's the architecture exhibit.

56:13.542 --> 56:15.210
- Architecture exhibit?
- Yeah.

56:15.377 --> 56:19.172
- I gotta eat something or I get the shakes.
- We'll eat in 20 minutes.

56:19.340 --> 56:21.799
My friend Tucker is upstairs.
I want you to meet him.

56:21.967 --> 56:25.387
- He's an architect too. Come on, Yeah.
- Architect?

56:25.555 --> 56:26.889
Tucker.

56:27.057 --> 56:31.143
This is amazing.
This just blows me away.

56:31.311 --> 56:35.773
What do you think this falls under?
Is this art deco, or is it art nouveau?

56:36.816 --> 56:39.610
- Deco. Deco, yeah.
- Yeah.

56:40.070 --> 56:41.820
It's beautiful.

56:42.197 --> 56:45.908
Is this...?
Okay, is this a vestibule, or is it a portico?

56:46.076 --> 56:47.534
What is the difference?

56:47.702 --> 56:53.249
When you're looking at architecture,
try to visualize the buildings as a whole.

56:53.416 --> 56:57.878
You know, try to see them
in their natural state.

56:58.046 --> 57:03.717
In their totalitarianism, so to speak.

57:03.885 --> 57:08.222
- Stone-crab time. Let's go to Joe's, huh?
- Hey, Tucker.

57:10.642 --> 57:12.393
Mary.

57:12.560 --> 57:13.811
How are you?

57:14.229 --> 57:15.938
Good, I'm glad we saw you.

57:17.565 --> 57:19.400
Come on, like you mean it.

57:19.567 --> 57:22.695
Tucker. This is my friend Pat Healy.

57:22.862 --> 57:25.489
- Oh, it's a pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
- Same here.

57:25.657 --> 57:28.742
- Pat is an architect as well.
- Oh, really?

57:28.910 --> 57:32.288
- Where are your offices?
- Mainly. I work out of Boston.

57:32.455 --> 57:34.248
Boston, huh?

57:34.416 --> 57:37.752
- Did you get your degree up there?
- You bet.

57:38.087 --> 57:40.213
Really? Where did you study?

57:40.756 --> 57:42.132
Harvard.

57:42.300 --> 57:45.427
Then you must have studied
under Kim Green.

57:45.636 --> 57:46.845
Well, among others.

57:48.347 --> 57:51.975
You know,
Pat does projects all over the world.

57:52.143 --> 57:54.352
Really?
Where would I have seen your work?

57:55.104 --> 57:57.272
Well, have you been to?

57:57.440 --> 57:59.190
Well, let me see.

57:59.358 --> 58:02.235
Santiago, Chile?

58:02.403 --> 58:05.697
Twice last year. Which building is yours?

58:07.116 --> 58:12.579
- Are you familiar with the soccer stadium?
- Did you build the Estadio Olímpico?

58:13.205 --> 58:18.418
No, just down the street.
the Celinto Catayente Towers.

58:18.794 --> 58:21.212
It's quite a fine example, in fact.

58:21.380 --> 58:23.339
I recommend next time
you're up that way...

58:23.507 --> 58:28.094
...that you drop in
and take a ganders at it yourself.

58:29.930 --> 58:33.308
- You know, I really should take your card.
- Sure.

58:34.935 --> 58:37.437
As I live and breathe.
Will you excuse us for a second?

58:37.605 --> 58:41.191
- I'll call you, okay?
- Hey, Earl.

58:41.358 --> 58:44.319
Earl Stein, you old sheep-fucker.
How the hell are you?

58:44.487 --> 58:46.280
My name's Brian.

58:46.448 --> 58:48.908
Good one. What the hell
are you doing out here, Earl?

58:49.076 --> 58:50.743
No, no. My name's Brian.

58:50.911 --> 58:52.953
Brian Mone.

58:54.372 --> 58:58.709
Oh, I see. Okay, yeah.
Whatever you say. "Brian."

58:58.877 --> 59:00.669
I'll see you at the office, huh?

59:00.837 --> 59:03.380
I'll tell you some stories
about this weirdo.

59:04.341 --> 59:05.925
You know that guy?

59:11.890 --> 59:14.391
Hey, thanks for picking me up, man.

59:14.559 --> 59:17.561
Yeah, no problem.
I've been driving for like 15 hours straight...

59:17.729 --> 59:19.605
...so I could use the company.

59:19.773 --> 59:24.485
I know what you mean. I've been standing
in the same spot for five and a half hours.

59:24.653 --> 59:27.279
You know they made it illegal
to hitchhike in this state?

59:27.447 --> 59:31.158
Really? That must make it really tough.

59:31.326 --> 59:35.412
So, what's going on with you?
You a salesman, or?

59:35.831 --> 59:40.000
No. No. I'm nothing.

59:40.168 --> 59:41.836
I am.

59:42.629 --> 59:44.130
- Yeah?
- I'm a salesman.

59:44.297 --> 59:47.133
- I'm gonna start my own company.
- Really?

59:47.300 --> 59:49.051
You want in?

59:53.223 --> 59:54.390
No, I'm not...

59:54.559 --> 59:56.685
I don't really have any.
you know, money, or...

59:56.853 --> 59:59.604
You heard of this thing,
the 8 Minute Abs?

59:59.772 --> 01:00:02.524
Yeah, sure, 8 Minute Abs.
yeah, the exercise video.

01:00:02.692 --> 01:00:07.362
Yeah, well, this is gonna blow that
right out of the water. Listen to this.

01:00:08.364 --> 01:00:12.033
7 Minute Abs.

01:00:14.036 --> 01:00:17.497
Right. Yes, okay, all right.
I see where you're going.

01:00:17.665 --> 01:00:21.251
Think about it. You walk into a video store.
see 8 Minute Abs sitting there...

01:00:21.419 --> 01:00:25.297
...there's 7 Minute Abs right beside it.
Which one are you gonna pick, man?

01:00:25.464 --> 01:00:30.385
- I would go for the 7. Yeah.
- Bingo, man, bingo. 7 Minute Abs.

01:00:30.553 --> 01:00:33.972
And we guarantee just as good
a workout as the 8 Minute folk.

01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:36.516
You guarantee it? How do you do that?

01:00:36.684 --> 01:00:40.103
If you're not happy
with the first seven minutes...

01:00:40.271 --> 01:00:43.732
...we're gonna send you
the extra minute free.

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:46.943
See, that's it. That's our motto.
That's where we're coming from.

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:48.486
That's from A to B.

01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:51.114
That's right. That's good. That's good.

01:00:51.908 --> 01:00:54.910
Unless, of course,
somebody comes up with 6 Minute Abs.

01:00:55.077 --> 01:00:57.370
Then you're in trouble, huh?

01:01:03.836 --> 01:01:06.631
No. No, no, not six.

01:01:06.798 --> 01:01:09.342
I said seven.
Nobody's coming up with six.

01:01:09.509 --> 01:01:10.927
Who works out in six minutes?

01:01:11.094 --> 01:01:15.348
You won't even get your heart going.
Not even a mouse on a wheel.

01:01:15.515 --> 01:01:17.433
- Good point.
- Seven's the key number here.

01:01:17.601 --> 01:01:20.937
- Think about it. 7-Elevens. seven dwarfs.
- Seven, yeah.

01:01:21.104 --> 01:01:23.147
Seven, man, that's the number.

01:01:23.315 --> 01:01:25.608
Seven chipmunks twirling on a branch...

01:01:25.776 --> 01:01:28.319
...eating lots of sunflowers
on my uncle's ranch.

01:01:28.487 --> 01:01:31.614
You know that old children's tale
from the sea.

01:01:31.782 --> 01:01:34.242
It's like you're dreaming
about Gorgonzola cheese...

01:01:34.409 --> 01:01:38.120
...when it's clearly Brie time, baby.

01:01:38.622 --> 01:01:40.373
Step into my office.

01:01:40.540 --> 01:01:43.626
- Why?
- Because you're fucking fired.

01:01:44.336 --> 01:01:46.837
Yeah. You know what? I gotta pee.
I'm gonna pull over.

01:01:47.005 --> 01:01:52.009
Your car seats are making me itchy, man.
What are these made out of, cactus?

01:01:56.932 --> 01:02:00.851
I'm only waiting seven minutes total.

01:02:09.486 --> 01:02:13.322
- Hey, wait your turn.
- Sorry, I didn't get a...

01:02:15.743 --> 01:02:18.412
- We gotta get out of here.
- Wait a minute. Hey, hey.

01:02:20.790 --> 01:02:23.709
- This is a raid.
- No. No, no, no. I was peeing.

01:02:23.876 --> 01:02:25.836
That's what I was doing.
I was just peeing.

01:02:26.004 --> 01:02:28.839
- I was peeing too.
- Yeah, I'm sure you were all just pissing.

01:02:29.007 --> 01:02:32.843
- Let's go. Let's move it out.
- Let's go. In the truck, everybody.

01:02:34.220 --> 01:02:38.515
Holy Shit. Jimmy Shay, is that you?

01:02:53.448 --> 01:02:56.658
- No, really...
- Oh, my God.

01:02:57.035 --> 01:02:58.702
Ted?

01:03:01.539 --> 01:03:04.583
If you let me talk to you for one second
outside of the truck.

01:03:04.751 --> 01:03:08.128
- Into the truck. Get in the truck.
- Look, I still have to pee. I wasn't...

01:03:08.296 --> 01:03:09.963
- Let's go.
- Can I have a cup?

01:03:10.131 --> 01:03:11.757
See, hon? I told you he was gay.

01:03:11.924 --> 01:03:16.678
We'll be right back with more Cops,
live from the heartland.

01:03:41.663 --> 01:03:43.748
That grandmother of yours
is really something.

01:03:43.916 --> 01:03:45.958
Who, Magda?
No, Magda's not my grandmother.

01:03:46.126 --> 01:03:50.254
She rents the apartment next door.
Her husband died a couple years ago...

01:03:50.422 --> 01:03:54.050
...and I don't think she likes being alone,
so, you know, she just hangs out.

01:03:54.218 --> 01:03:57.512
- Doesn't cramp your style?
- Sadly, no.

01:03:57.930 --> 01:04:02.350
You know, sometimes I wish
I could be like Magda and not go home.

01:04:02.726 --> 01:04:07.605
Yeah. I'd like to bounce around for a while
and do some traveling.

01:04:07.773 --> 01:04:10.733
I don't know why anybody
would wanna bounce around...

01:04:10.901 --> 01:04:13.361
...you know,
if they had their own condo in Nepal.

01:04:13.529 --> 01:04:16.697
- I'd be there in a second.
- I'd sell it.

01:04:16.865 --> 01:04:19.575
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Start fresh in a new place...

01:04:19.743 --> 01:04:21.869
...give up the architect game.

01:04:22.037 --> 01:04:26.416
Slow things down a bit.
read more books, see more movies.

01:04:26.583 --> 01:04:28.418
Are you a movie buff?

01:04:28.585 --> 01:04:32.296
Well, I try to be, but it's tough going
with all the crap they make today.

01:04:32.464 --> 01:04:35.592
I guess I just wish they made movies
like they used to make.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:39.388
You know, classics like The Karate Kid
or Harold and Maude.

01:04:41.891 --> 01:04:44.893
Harold and Maude
is my all-time favorite movie.

01:04:45.061 --> 01:04:48.439
- Don't bust my chops. I know it's corny...
- Pat, I'm not kidding.

01:04:48.606 --> 01:04:53.110
I think Harold and Maude is one of
the greatest love stories of our time.

01:04:56.322 --> 01:04:58.949
Here I thought I was the only one.

01:05:00.118 --> 01:05:03.328
You're too good to be true.
Come on, let's go dance.

01:05:10.545 --> 01:05:12.254
Hey, guys.

01:05:18.344 --> 01:05:19.970
So...

01:05:22.015 --> 01:05:27.019
- Yeah, well, I guess this is it. huh?
- I guess.

01:05:27.187 --> 01:05:29.855
- I'll see you around.
- Okay.

01:05:31.149 --> 01:05:33.525
- Mary?
- Yeah?

01:05:34.694 --> 01:05:35.986
- Forget it.
- What?

01:05:36.154 --> 01:05:38.989
- No, no, it's stupid.
- What? Come on, you can say it.

01:05:39.157 --> 01:05:41.992
- No, really, it's moronic.
- Just say it.

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:44.913
Can I feel your bosoms before I go?

01:05:48.918 --> 01:05:50.793
Knock yourself out.

01:06:03.432 --> 01:06:07.644
- Okey-doke. So tomorrow night?
- Sure.

01:06:18.113 --> 01:06:21.241
Man, they never look like you'd expect.
do they?

01:06:23.035 --> 01:06:26.621
That's probably how he got his victim
to drop his guard.

01:06:27.748 --> 01:06:29.832
Where'd they find the body?

01:06:30.084 --> 01:06:34.087
In a big red bag
on the front passenger seat.

01:06:34.255 --> 01:06:36.923
All hacked up.

01:06:37.258 --> 01:06:39.008
Gruesome.

01:06:39.552 --> 01:06:42.262
Real psycho, this one.

01:06:43.264 --> 01:06:47.100
Hey, you're a little worked up.
Let me do the talking.

01:06:50.771 --> 01:06:54.358
- I'm Detective Stabler. This is Krevoy.
- Look, I didn't solicit any sex, okay?

01:06:54.526 --> 01:06:55.985
This is a huge misunderstanding.

01:06:56.152 --> 01:06:58.946
I was going out to pee.
I'm walking in the bushes...

01:06:59.114 --> 01:07:01.865
...I trip over this guy.
and there were all these cops and...

01:07:02.033 --> 01:07:05.786
Ted, Ted, Ted, it's okay. We believe you.

01:07:12.669 --> 01:07:16.755
The problem is,
we found your friend in the car.

01:07:18.174 --> 01:07:20.259
Oh, the hitchhiker?

01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:22.845
That's what this is about? The hitchhiker?

01:07:24.306 --> 01:07:27.558
Oh, great. Just my luck.

01:07:27.726 --> 01:07:29.810
I get caught for everything.

01:07:29.978 --> 01:07:33.856
So you admit it?

01:07:34.149 --> 01:07:36.942
Yeah. Guilty as charged.

01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:39.862
Look. I know that you guys
have got a job to do, all right?

01:07:40.030 --> 01:07:43.282
And I'm really sorry. I did it, I admit it.

01:07:43.450 --> 01:07:48.162
You know, the guy even told me.
The hitchhiker told me it was illegal, so...

01:07:49.289 --> 01:07:50.831
Well...

01:07:53.543 --> 01:07:55.085
...can you tell us his name?

01:07:59.132 --> 01:08:01.091
No, I didn't catch it.

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:05.764
Can we cut to the chase? I mean,
am I, like, in a lot of trouble here, or?

01:08:06.557 --> 01:08:08.558
First, tell us why you did it.

01:08:08.726 --> 01:08:10.644
Why I did it?

01:08:12.938 --> 01:08:15.148
I don't know. Boredom?

01:08:17.026 --> 01:08:19.234
Guy turns out to be a blabbermouth.

01:08:19.403 --> 01:08:21.738
Just would not shut up. I mean, just...

01:08:21.906 --> 01:08:27.285
Ted, this wasn't your first time, was it?

01:08:28.703 --> 01:08:30.246
No.

01:08:31.082 --> 01:08:36.752
- How many are we talking here?
- Hitchhikers? My whole life?

01:08:37.755 --> 01:08:42.133
I don't know. Twenty-five. 50.
I mean, who keeps track?

01:08:43.094 --> 01:08:45.886
Hey, I know this is the Bible belt,
but where I come from...

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:48.139
...this is not that big a deal.

01:08:48.307 --> 01:08:50.100
- I mean...
- You son of a bitch.

01:08:51.268 --> 01:08:53.144
You're gonna fry.

01:08:54.188 --> 01:08:58.774
Hey. Hey. Take it easy. Cut it out.
What the hell are you doing? Take it easy.

01:08:58.943 --> 01:09:01.111
- You okay?
- What the hell is wrong with you?

01:09:01.278 --> 01:09:02.319
- You all right?
- Punk.

01:09:02.488 --> 01:09:04.029
Jesus.

01:09:24.970 --> 01:09:27.430
Your friend Tucker stopped by.

01:09:27.973 --> 01:09:29.473
Really?

01:09:30.308 --> 01:09:33.477
Okay. Hey, what does it look like today?

01:09:33.645 --> 01:09:36.272
It's fine. A little crazy in the afternoon.

01:09:37.858 --> 01:09:38.899
Hey, Tucker.

01:09:40.152 --> 01:09:41.527
What's up, doc?

01:09:42.988 --> 01:09:45.740
You look different.
Did you do something with your hair?

01:09:46.408 --> 01:09:48.951
The teeth. The teeth, I got them capped.

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:51.370
Oh, yeah? Hey, they look great.

01:09:51.537 --> 01:09:55.583
- You don't think they look a little big?
- No, not at all. The bigger the better.

01:09:56.042 --> 01:09:57.460
But they could be brighter.

01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:02.882
There's nothing more sexy to me than a guy
with a mouthful of big pearly whites.

01:10:03.049 --> 01:10:04.091
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:10:04.259 --> 01:10:07.178
Come here.
You ever had one up the hatch in here?

01:10:07.345 --> 01:10:09.638
- Tucker, behave yourself.
- I'm sorry.

01:10:12.476 --> 01:10:14.310
What can I do for you today, my friend?

01:10:14.478 --> 01:10:18.355
I wanted to talk to you
about your friend Patrick.

01:10:18.523 --> 01:10:19.690
He's a nice guy, huh?

01:10:19.858 --> 01:10:23.403
Well, that's what I'm trying to figure out.
How long have you known him?

01:10:23.571 --> 01:10:25.655
Not very long, but I like him.

01:10:26.199 --> 01:10:30.535
Well, I know he's a little different,
but that's what I like about him.

01:10:30.703 --> 01:10:33.163
He dresses like a complete dork.

01:10:33.331 --> 01:10:35.707
He chews with his mouth open.

01:10:35.875 --> 01:10:40.712
He hardly ever says the right thing,
and he probably farts too.

01:10:41.130 --> 01:10:44.549
That's what you're looking for, is it?
A farter?

01:10:44.926 --> 01:10:46.802
No, I'm looking for a guy.

01:10:47.637 --> 01:10:52.140
Look, it's just that something struck me
as strange about him last night.

01:10:52.934 --> 01:10:54.643
He gave me this funny vibe.

01:10:55.311 --> 01:10:57.562
Anyway, I called some friends up north...

01:10:57.730 --> 01:11:01.066
...and they've never heard of an architect
named Patrick Healy.

01:11:01.526 --> 01:11:03.819
And he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.

01:11:03.986 --> 01:11:05.529
- Fuck!
- Really?

01:11:06.739 --> 01:11:08.740
- That's strange.
- Yes, I thought so.

01:11:08.908 --> 01:11:12.202
Anyway, I hope you don't think
I'm being meddlesome.

01:11:12.370 --> 01:11:16.122
It's just that I think you should be careful
with this guy, that's all.

01:11:16.874 --> 01:11:18.041
I mean, let's face it.

01:11:18.209 --> 01:11:23.713
You're beautiful, and you've got money,
and you trust people.

01:11:24.173 --> 01:11:26.591
I'm just saying,
there's a lot of psychos out there.

01:11:26.759 --> 01:11:29.135
- Just be careful.
- Fucker.

01:11:29.303 --> 01:11:33.599
Look, Tucker, thank you.
I really appreciate you looking out for me.

01:11:34.768 --> 01:11:36.644
Okay, listen, I'll call you.

01:11:36.812 --> 01:11:39.272
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:45.278
Damn.

01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:55.454
- You want me to get those for you?
- No. I have to learn to do this myself.

01:11:59.877 --> 01:12:01.460
Damn.

01:12:03.589 --> 01:12:06.632
My leg. Could you, Mary?

01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:09.677
Thank you.

01:12:10.512 --> 01:12:12.638
Wait. Wait.

01:12:13.932 --> 01:12:15.308
There.

01:12:23.775 --> 01:12:24.859
- See?
- Yeah.

01:12:25.027 --> 01:12:27.653
- I knew I could do it.
- I see. Here, let me get the door.

01:12:27.821 --> 01:12:29.155
Thank you.

01:12:29.865 --> 01:12:31.073
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

01:12:31.241 --> 01:12:33.993
Jane, can you get the door
for Tucker, please?

01:12:34.161 --> 01:12:36.287
Do you...? You want me to?

01:12:36.455 --> 01:12:39.498
- No. I've done this a thousand times.
- Okay.

01:12:46.424 --> 01:12:48.175
Mr. Stroehmann...

01:12:48.343 --> 01:12:52.721
...on behalf of the entire South Carolina
Law Enforcement community...

01:12:52.889 --> 01:12:57.809
...I would like to apologize to you
for any pain or temporary inconvenience...

01:12:57.977 --> 01:12:59.978
...that you may have been caused.

01:13:04.025 --> 01:13:05.859
At approximately 10:40 this morning...

01:13:06.027 --> 01:13:09.446
...a man was apprehended
not far from where you were arrested.

01:13:09.614 --> 01:13:12.157
He was identified
as an escaped mental patient...

01:13:12.325 --> 01:13:15.577
...and subsequently he confessed
to the murder you're being held for.

01:13:15.745 --> 01:13:18.455
Lab tests confirm a fingerprint match.

01:13:18.623 --> 01:13:22.167
You mean I'm free to go?

01:13:22.919 --> 01:13:25.003
No harm, no foul.

01:13:27.048 --> 01:13:29.633
Oh, by the way,
there's someone there to see you.

01:13:33.972 --> 01:13:35.931
Shut up.

01:13:44.148 --> 01:13:47.192
You are a lucky son of a bitch,
you know that?

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.196
- I am?
- Yeah. Didn't they tell you?

01:13:51.365 --> 01:13:55.576
That hitcher was about to cut your throat
before you decided to take a piss.

01:13:55.744 --> 01:13:57.996
Had a fucking horseshoe up your ass,
my man.

01:14:02.751 --> 01:14:05.586
You got that nervous-hive thing again?

01:14:05.963 --> 01:14:11.342
Yeah. Yeah, I do, Ted,
because I got some bad news.

01:14:12.469 --> 01:14:14.095
Are you okay?

01:14:17.725 --> 01:14:18.850
Ted, I'm dying.

01:14:23.605 --> 01:14:25.273
Oh, my...

01:14:26.567 --> 01:14:30.570
Ted, I'm not dying, man. Come on.

01:14:30.738 --> 01:14:33.906
Jesus, it's just the humidity down here
or something. Come on.

01:14:34.074 --> 01:14:37.994
No. No, Ted, the bad news I got
is about our friend Healy.

01:14:38.162 --> 01:14:40.788
I sent my assistant to his apartment
with his last check.

01:14:40.956 --> 01:14:42.790
The landlady said when he came back...

01:14:42.958 --> 01:14:47.170
...he kept talking about
falling for some doctor named Mary.

01:14:48.130 --> 01:14:50.715
- Mary? My Mary?
- Well...

01:14:51.884 --> 01:14:55.845
Ted, here's Healy's address down there.

01:14:56.013 --> 01:15:00.141
In the future, do a little research before
you send a guy like that out into the woods.

01:15:00.309 --> 01:15:03.020
I mean, Jesus Chris, it's creepy, okay?

01:15:05.190 --> 01:15:07.900
You're not thinking about
going out with this guy again?

01:15:08.068 --> 01:15:10.069
Mary, honey, he's a psycho.

01:15:10.236 --> 01:15:14.490
- Mary, the guy's full of shit.
- Jesus, this sucks.

01:15:14.657 --> 01:15:17.159
It's too bad this had to happen.

01:15:17.911 --> 01:15:20.162
He was almost perfect.

01:15:20.705 --> 01:15:23.373
Mary, what did you say
Pat's last name was?

01:15:23.541 --> 01:15:25.793
- Healy.
- Come here, come here, come here.

01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:27.628
- Come on. You gotta hear this.
- What?

01:15:27.796 --> 01:15:31.340
- That's the way us Healys were raised.
- So where the hell are you, Healy?

01:15:31.508 --> 01:15:34.802
I got a date tonight
with that Mary girl I told you about.

01:15:34.969 --> 01:15:36.512
- The sawbones?
- Yep.

01:15:36.679 --> 01:15:39.014
- Oh, my God, we hit the mother lode.
- You guys...

01:15:39.182 --> 01:15:41.391
...should we be listening to this?

01:15:42.185 --> 01:15:45.312
- She still think you're a fucking architect?
- Oh, yeah.

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.106
Dumb shit.

01:15:47.273 --> 01:15:48.482
Mr. Perfect, huh?

01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:52.444
Hey, watch your mouth.
She's a great gal, Mary.

01:15:52.612 --> 01:15:57.074
- I'm the dumb shit for lying to her.
- Why didn't you just tell her the truth?

01:15:57.700 --> 01:15:58.742
I don't know.

01:15:58.910 --> 01:16:02.538
I guess it seems that women today
are more impressed by the almighty buck...

01:16:02.705 --> 01:16:07.376
...than some schmo who's spent 17 years
scraping by on Peace Corps wages.

01:16:07.544 --> 01:16:08.585
Jesus, man.

01:16:08.753 --> 01:16:11.381
If she's as special as you say.
she's gonna wanna hear...

01:16:11.549 --> 01:16:12.882
...about the things you did.

01:16:13.050 --> 01:16:16.928
"You could tell her about
the irrigation ditches you dug in Sudan.

01:16:17.096 --> 01:16:20.390
The orphan babies
who cried in your arms in...

01:16:21.725 --> 01:16:23.101
...Romania.

01:16:23.269 --> 01:16:27.147
The hope you gave Freddy the leper
in Calcutta."

01:16:27.314 --> 01:16:29.899
I'll be honest with you.
I'm a selfish prick.

01:16:30.067 --> 01:16:33.611
I get a high
from helping all God's creatures.

01:16:34.822 --> 01:16:37.740
An honest-to-goodness high.
I did all those things for myself.

01:16:37.908 --> 01:16:39.742
Hey, hey, hey.

01:16:44.582 --> 01:16:46.749
That's bullshit, man.

01:16:46.917 --> 01:16:49.335
Hey. Hey, you were on the front line.

01:16:50.254 --> 01:16:54.424
You remember?
The malaria, the typhoon fever?

01:16:54.592 --> 01:16:58.261
That vicious strain of genital herpes?

01:16:59.597 --> 01:17:01.139
Fuck.

01:17:03.517 --> 01:17:07.729
Yeah, I cured all sorts of horrible illnesses
in Third World countries.

01:17:07.897 --> 01:17:12.066
But the bottom line is, I'm not gonna use
my philanthropy as some kind of currency.

01:17:12.234 --> 01:17:14.068
?specially after what I did.

01:17:14.945 --> 01:17:17.363
I lied to that poor girl.

01:17:19.408 --> 01:17:20.743
Lied, man.

01:17:20.911 --> 01:17:25.581
Well, love will make you do...

01:17:26.791 --> 01:17:27.958
...fucked-up things.

01:17:28.168 --> 01:17:32.421
You said it, mister. I gotta run.

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:35.466
We're dicks.

01:17:41.473 --> 01:17:43.724
Come here, baby.
Come here, sweetheart.

01:17:44.142 --> 01:17:47.394
I'll feed you and Bill soon.
Come on, honey.

01:17:53.401 --> 01:17:55.110
It's him. It's him.

01:17:55.278 --> 01:17:58.113
Oh, hi, Mary.

01:17:58.823 --> 01:18:00.324
Hello.

01:18:01.409 --> 01:18:03.202
Mary, look.

01:18:04.955 --> 01:18:07.248
Look, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:18:07.415 --> 01:18:09.875
I'm not the architect you...

01:18:17.175 --> 01:18:20.302
- Okay, guys, let's huddle up.
- Come on, Jimmy.

01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:22.346
Jimmy, I'm open. Hit me. Come on.

01:18:33.818 --> 01:18:36.403
Exceptional, my ass.

01:18:48.749 --> 01:18:53.670
Looks like I double-jumped you, Warren,
for the win. Pay up, big guy.

01:18:56.173 --> 01:18:58.717
- Coconut.
- Yeah, very good. Coconut.

01:18:58.884 --> 01:19:00.677
Coconut.

01:19:01.345 --> 01:19:02.846
Where's the rest of it, Warren?

01:19:14.817 --> 01:19:16.276
Look at her.

01:19:17.069 --> 01:19:21.531
She's more beautiful than I remember.
She's perfect.

01:19:21.866 --> 01:19:25.327
Thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare.
Sorry I forgot my wallet.

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:29.122
- I feel like a dog.
- Don't worry about it. It was fun.

01:19:35.629 --> 01:19:37.630
Fuck me.

01:19:38.966 --> 01:19:41.218
How's my stomach taste?

01:19:41.386 --> 01:19:43.554
"How's my stomach taste," she says.

01:19:43.972 --> 01:19:46.474
Holy shit. Look. Look. There's Warren.

01:19:46.641 --> 01:19:48.726
Franks and beans.

01:19:49.144 --> 01:19:51.187
- Frank and beans.
- Warren, you just ate.

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:54.315
Leave him alone.
He's just got a big appetite. Right, Warren?

01:19:56.068 --> 01:19:57.318
I said you got a big...

01:19:59.279 --> 01:20:01.447
Warren. Warren, Warren.

01:20:01.907 --> 01:20:03.574
Yes.

01:20:03.742 --> 01:20:06.744
Listen, you can't touch his ears
unless he trusts you. I'm sorry.

01:20:06.912 --> 01:20:09.914
- Are you okay?
- Not to worry.

01:20:10.123 --> 01:20:13.417
- So I'll see you tonight, right?
- Sure.

01:20:16.505 --> 01:20:18.464
Come here. Warren. You okay?

01:20:18.632 --> 01:20:20.341
- He broke it.
- I saw.

01:20:21.468 --> 01:20:23.427
Okay. What are you waiting for? Let's go.

01:20:23.595 --> 01:20:26.722
- What? No, I don't know what to say.
- What are you talking about?

01:20:26.890 --> 01:20:30.476
Tell her the truth about Healy.
Blow the schmuck out of the water.

01:20:30.644 --> 01:20:32.311
No, I can't.

01:20:32.479 --> 01:20:36.190
I unleashed the psycho on her.
She's gonna be fucking pissed.

01:20:37.317 --> 01:20:40.986
- Mary, Mary.
- No, no. Stop.

01:20:42.614 --> 01:20:44.156
Mary?

01:20:46.326 --> 01:20:50.247
Mary? Is that...? It is you.

01:20:51.332 --> 01:20:55.127
- Who is that?
- Hi. It's Ted.

01:20:55.294 --> 01:20:56.670
Ted?

01:20:56.838 --> 01:20:59.381
Yeah, Ted from Rhode Island. Ted.

01:20:59.549 --> 01:21:02.592
Te...? Oh, my God. Ted.

01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.345
- Hey. Good, how are you?
- It's good to see you.

01:21:05.513 --> 01:21:07.514
- Good to see you.
- How you been?

01:21:07.682 --> 01:21:09.349
I'm...

01:21:09.517 --> 01:21:11.351
I haven't seen you since...

01:21:11.519 --> 01:21:13.395
Yeah, since...

01:21:13.563 --> 01:21:17.482
- Senior prom.
- That's right, senior prom.

01:21:17.650 --> 01:21:21.027
You got a great memory.
Oh, man, that was...

01:21:21.195 --> 01:21:23.530
Haven't thought about that in years.
Yeah.

01:21:23.698 --> 01:21:26.491
So how's everything?

01:21:27.869 --> 01:21:30.537
- Everything, you know.
- Oh, that's fine.

01:21:30.705 --> 01:21:33.165
I was in and out of the hospital
in a couple of weeks.

01:21:33.332 --> 01:21:35.292
It was not a big deal at all.

01:21:35.459 --> 01:21:39.212
Now I'm good. Strong like bull. Really good.

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:41.756
- Hey. Hi, Warren.
- Hi, Ted.

01:21:41.924 --> 01:21:45.135
- How are you?
- I'm... How are you?

01:21:45.887 --> 01:21:49.264
- I can't believe that he remembers you.
- Piggyback ride?

01:21:49.432 --> 01:21:52.767
Oh, piggyb... No. You know what?
I'll take a rain check this time, okay?

01:21:52.935 --> 01:21:54.561
He never remembers anybody.

01:21:54.729 --> 01:21:56.813
- It's amazing.
- Yeah.

01:21:56.981 --> 01:21:58.523
So, what are you doing here?

01:21:58.691 --> 01:22:01.277
- Do you work here, or...?
- Yeah, no, this is my office.

01:22:01.445 --> 01:22:02.737
Well, it's up there.

01:22:03.572 --> 01:22:06.908
So yeah. I was just out
on my lunch break with Warren. It's crazy.

01:22:07.075 --> 01:22:09.702
- What are you doing here?
- Well, that's a funny story.

01:22:09.870 --> 01:22:12.205
I was... I decided to...

01:22:12.372 --> 01:22:15.917
I got in the car with my friend.
and we just...

01:22:16.084 --> 01:22:19.754
We came down to Florida, right?

01:22:22.633 --> 01:22:24.425
Right.

01:22:25.260 --> 01:22:27.637
Well, you look great.
You look really good.

01:22:27.804 --> 01:22:30.598
I mean, what's the story?
Are you married? Do you have kids?

01:22:30.766 --> 01:22:33.434
- No. No. Dodged a few bullets.
- Yeah?

01:22:33.602 --> 01:22:37.647
Yeah. God, this is just so bizarre.

01:22:37.814 --> 01:22:41.859
- I'm standing here with Mary Jensen.
- No, no, now it's Mary Matthews.

01:22:42.027 --> 01:22:43.194
Oh, did you?

01:22:43.362 --> 01:22:46.697
No, no, no. I haven't walked
down that plank yet, no.

01:22:46.865 --> 01:22:49.742
But it was this thing in college.

01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:51.786
This creepy guy who...

01:22:51.954 --> 01:22:54.872
Anyhow, there was a restraining order.
it got kind of ugly...

01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:58.459
...and after Princeton, I decided,
"You know what? Be cautious.

01:22:58.627 --> 01:23:01.087
Change your name.
Just kind of leave that behind."

01:23:01.255 --> 01:23:03.214
- Right. Right.
- Just didn't need that.

01:23:03.382 --> 01:23:05.633
- That sounds horrible.
- It was... Yeah.

01:23:05.801 --> 01:23:08.970
It was, but it's over, I think, so it's good.

01:23:09.137 --> 01:23:12.474
Hey, what are you doing tonight?
Do you think you wanna, I don't know...

01:23:12.642 --> 01:23:15.269
...go out to dinner?
You know, catch up on old times?

01:23:16.062 --> 01:23:17.562
Didn't we just do that?

01:23:21.276 --> 01:23:23.527
I'm fucking with you, Ted.

01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:29.366
No, listen, I'd really... I'd like to.

01:23:29.534 --> 01:23:32.995
It'd be great.
but I sort of already have plans tonight.

01:23:33.162 --> 01:23:36.248
- But I'm free tomorrow night.
- Yeah, sure. Or, you know...

01:23:36.416 --> 01:23:39.334
Or you could blow off that jerk
you're going out with tonight...

01:23:39.502 --> 01:23:40.752
...and come out with me.

01:23:44.257 --> 01:23:46.508
What hotel are you staying at?

01:23:46.676 --> 01:23:48.302
The Cardozo.

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:52.014
- Pick you up at 8?
- Sure.

01:23:52.181 --> 01:23:53.307
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:23:53.474 --> 01:23:56.143
- Cool. See you.
- Bye.

01:23:56.477 --> 01:23:59.104
Look closely at this picture

01:23:59.272 --> 01:24:01.648
Ted and Mary like before

01:24:01.816 --> 01:24:04.109
Can you see her as Ted sees her

01:24:04.277 --> 01:24:06.528
And why he couldn't wait no more?

01:24:06.696 --> 01:24:12.159
And if you still think he's being silly
Then you've still got more to see

01:24:12.327 --> 01:24:16.496
Because this isn't just a date, folks
This is chemistry

01:24:16.664 --> 01:24:19.292
And Mary

01:24:19.752 --> 01:24:24.047
Well, there's just something about Mary

01:24:33.223 --> 01:24:35.308
Banana, banana.

01:24:35.476 --> 01:24:38.895
We're gonna be buying bananas tonight.

01:24:39.063 --> 01:24:40.730
Why's that?

01:24:40.898 --> 01:24:47.362
Back when I was your age, I always used to
make myself a big banana split after sex.

01:24:47.529 --> 01:24:49.822
I think you're gonna need one tonight.

01:24:49.990 --> 01:24:53.659
Don't get ahead of yourself.
You'll be eating a banana split before I do.

01:24:53.827 --> 01:24:55.745
Don't bet on it.

01:24:56.789 --> 01:24:58.206
Last time I had a Pap smear...

01:24:58.374 --> 01:25:02.085
...the guy needed leather gloves
and an oyster shucker.

01:25:05.089 --> 01:25:07.382
I am a little psyched.

01:25:07.549 --> 01:25:11.511
I ran into this guy
I haven't seen since high school.

01:25:12.054 --> 01:25:16.432
- An old flame?
- Kind of. Ted Stroehmann.

01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:19.185
The sweetest guy in the world.

01:25:19.353 --> 01:25:20.603
I mean, he was so cute.

01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:25.358
He was so shy and clumsy,
and he had this huge mouth full of metal.

01:25:25.526 --> 01:25:27.819
You know how I like braces.

01:25:28.028 --> 01:25:30.155
Anyhow, we're going out tonight.

01:25:30.615 --> 01:25:32.199
Oh, no.

01:25:32.367 --> 01:25:35.577
God, that reminds me. I have to call
and cancel with what's-his-face.

01:25:36.121 --> 01:25:37.162
What's-his-face?

01:25:37.330 --> 01:25:39.915
Wait a minute.
do I sense a chill in the air?

01:25:40.083 --> 01:25:42.084
Oh, Magda.

01:25:42.335 --> 01:25:45.045
I let my head
get in the way of this one.

01:25:45.213 --> 01:25:49.425
You know, I always pick guys
from what I feel in here.

01:25:49.592 --> 01:25:52.177
But for some reason with Pat,
I kept saying to myself:

01:25:52.345 --> 01:25:55.806
"Mary, grow up. You have
so much in common with this guy.

01:25:55.974 --> 01:25:59.184
You'll learn to feel something for him."
But...

01:25:59.352 --> 01:26:01.061
...it just didn't happen.

01:26:05.191 --> 01:26:07.943
- Who is it?
- It's Tucker.

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:10.696
- Tucker.
- Hello. how are you?

01:26:10.864 --> 01:26:12.990
- Good, how are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.

01:26:13.158 --> 01:26:16.243
- Look who's here.
- There she is.

01:26:16.411 --> 01:26:19.496
I brought you
a little thirst quencher, Mag.

01:26:19.664 --> 01:26:23.125
- Oh. are you sweet.
- No, I'm not.

01:26:23.293 --> 01:26:25.502
I just wanna get you drunk
so you'll pass out...

01:26:25.670 --> 01:26:27.963
...and I can give Mary a good rogering.

01:26:28.965 --> 01:26:31.800
- You want me to pour you one?
- Thanks, but I have to be going.

01:26:31.968 --> 01:26:35.804
- Unfortunately, this is not a social visit.
- Really? What's up?

01:26:35.972 --> 01:26:39.476
Well, I've got a little more news
about your friend Healy.

01:26:39.643 --> 01:26:41.269
Tucker, everything's okay.

01:26:41.437 --> 01:26:44.355
He confessed everything.
He told me he's not an architect.

01:26:44.523 --> 01:26:47.317
You were right.
But right now, I'm actually running behind...

01:26:47.485 --> 01:26:49.110
Mary, the man's a killer.

01:26:50.154 --> 01:26:51.654
- What?
- Yes.

01:26:51.822 --> 01:26:54.032
I have a friend
in the Boston Police Department.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:58.161
He faxed me this this morning.
I'll just give you the highlights.

01:26:58.996 --> 01:27:01.039
After a short stint as a petty thief...

01:27:01.207 --> 01:27:06.669
...Patrick R. Healy graduated
to armed robbery by the age of 14.

01:27:06.837 --> 01:27:09.839
At 16, he committed his first murder.

01:27:10.007 --> 01:27:13.259
A pretty teacher's aide
named Molly Pettygrove.

01:27:13.427 --> 01:27:17.931
He was incarcerated until the age of 22,
when, despite a grim psychological profile...

01:27:18.098 --> 01:27:20.266
...the state was forced to release him.

01:27:20.434 --> 01:27:22.852
In his mid-20s
and again in his early 30s...

01:27:23.020 --> 01:27:26.773
...he was suspected of homicides
in the states of Utah and Washington.

01:27:26.941 --> 01:27:30.818
Unfortunately,
the bodies were so badly decomposed...

01:27:30.986 --> 01:27:35.240
...there wasn't enough evidence
to hold him, and so on and so forth.

01:27:35.699 --> 01:27:38.993
What am I gonna do?
I'm supposed to meet this guy in an hour.

01:27:39.161 --> 01:27:43.831
Well, just calm down.
Everything's going to be fine. Don't worry.

01:27:43.999 --> 01:27:45.708
Tucker.

01:27:46.585 --> 01:27:49.129
Why you two never hooked up
is beyond me.

01:27:50.090 --> 01:27:52.216
I'm so lucky to have you as a friend.

01:27:53.343 --> 01:27:56.971
Yes. well, don't get all gooey on me, now.
You're gonna give me a big head.

01:27:57.138 --> 01:27:59.056
See, the important thing, doctor...

01:27:59.224 --> 01:28:01.892
...is you have to distance yourself
as much as possible...

01:28:02.060 --> 01:28:03.769
...without pissing this psycho off.

01:28:05.689 --> 01:28:07.398
Okay.

01:28:07.857 --> 01:28:11.902
All right. I know what I've gotta do.
I know what I gotta do. Where's the phone?

01:28:26.126 --> 01:28:28.252
You're gonna pay, fucker.

01:28:46.229 --> 01:28:48.272
I don't know, Dom.

01:28:48.815 --> 01:28:51.775
I don't feel good. I feel nervous.
I really feel nervous.

01:28:51.943 --> 01:28:53.819
Oh, come on, relax. Relax.

01:28:53.987 --> 01:28:55.988
- You been to the cash machine?
- Yeah.

01:28:56.156 --> 01:28:59.200
Car clean? Plenty of gas?

01:28:59.994 --> 01:29:03.872
- Breath. How's your breath?
- It's fine. I had some Altoids.

01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:08.710
All right. I think you're all set.
So just go clean the pipes and it's a go.

01:29:09.837 --> 01:29:11.838
You know, clean the pipes.

01:29:12.256 --> 01:29:14.466
What do you mean, clean the pipes?

01:29:15.176 --> 01:29:19.012
You choke the chicken
before any big date. don't you?

01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:23.850
Tell me you spank the monkey
before any big date.

01:29:24.685 --> 01:29:28.355
Oh, my God. He doesn't flog the dolphin
before a big date.

01:29:28.522 --> 01:29:30.106
- No.
- Are you crazy?

01:29:30.274 --> 01:29:32.567
That's like going out there
with a loaded gun.

01:29:32.735 --> 01:29:35.362
Of course that's why you're nervous.

01:29:35.529 --> 01:29:39.032
Oh, my dear friend, please sit. Please.

01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:45.705
Look. after you've had sex with a girl
and you're lying in bed with her...

01:29:45.873 --> 01:29:47.248
...are you nervous?

01:29:47.416 --> 01:29:50.877
- No.
- No, you're not. Why?

01:29:51.045 --> 01:29:53.129
Because I'm tired.

01:29:53.297 --> 01:29:57.175
Wrong. It's because you ain't got
the baby batter on the brain anymore.

01:29:57.343 --> 01:30:00.720
Jesus. That stuff will fuck your head up.

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:02.764
Look.

01:30:02.932 --> 01:30:06.393
The most honest moment in a man's life
are the few minutes...

01:30:06.560 --> 01:30:07.895
...after he's blown his load.

01:30:08.063 --> 01:30:13.275
That is a medical fact, and the reason for it
is that you're no longer trying to get laid.

01:30:13.443 --> 01:30:18.280
You're actually... You're thinking like a girl,
and girls love that.

01:30:18.782 --> 01:30:20.825
Holy shit.

01:30:20.992 --> 01:30:23.411
I've been going out with a loaded gun.

01:30:24.788 --> 01:30:26.247
People get hurt that way.

01:31:00.115 --> 01:31:02.658
Healy. How smashing to see you.

01:31:02.826 --> 01:31:05.202
- You're dead, motherfucker.
- Okay. Take it easy.

01:31:05.370 --> 01:31:08.748
Who the fuck do you think you are,
making that shit up about me?

01:31:09.541 --> 01:31:11.959
It's that stalker, Ted.

01:31:12.294 --> 01:31:13.753
He got ahold of you, didn't he?

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:16.297
You're working for him, aren't you,
you little shit?

01:31:16.465 --> 01:31:17.799
Who?

01:31:25.224 --> 01:31:28.101
Either you come clean,
or I'm gonna kick your fucking ass.

01:31:28.269 --> 01:31:30.687
I love her, man.

01:31:31.564 --> 01:31:35.275
- What?
- You heard me, goddamn it.

01:31:37.779 --> 01:31:39.780
I love Mary, man.

01:31:42.366 --> 01:31:46.119
I'm a phony. Just like you.

01:31:46.412 --> 01:31:51.333
- What do you mean?
- I mean I'm a fucking fraud.

01:31:51.501 --> 01:31:54.628
I'm no architect. Don't be a putz, man.

01:31:55.713 --> 01:31:59.841
Who's been to Santiago, Chile.
twice in one year?

01:32:00.343 --> 01:32:05.096
- I've never even been to Jersey.
- Okay, okay. Just take it easy.

01:32:05.264 --> 01:32:07.808
Wait a minute.
You knew those people back at Harvard.

01:32:07.975 --> 01:32:10.101
Fuck. I knew shit, man.

01:32:10.269 --> 01:32:13.438
The only thing I knew
was that you were a fake...

01:32:13.648 --> 01:32:15.482
...and I made up everything else.

01:32:16.609 --> 01:32:18.109
My real name's Norm.

01:32:19.362 --> 01:32:21.363
I'm a pizza-delivery boy.

01:32:21.531 --> 01:32:24.991
Here. Look. Here's my ID.

01:32:33.335 --> 01:32:34.544
Fuck me.

01:32:36.713 --> 01:32:39.340
Hey, boy. How about the pizza, huh?

01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.594
Yeah? Well, fuck you.

01:32:44.972 --> 01:32:46.097
Calm down, honey.

01:32:46.265 --> 01:32:48.766
Hey, you want your pizza? Here, man.

01:32:54.273 --> 01:32:56.065
Excuse my friend.

01:32:56.233 --> 01:32:58.442
He's had a little too much to drink.

01:33:08.245 --> 01:33:10.663
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33:18.505 --> 01:33:20.464
Keep the change.

01:34:17.523 --> 01:34:20.984
Where the hell did it go?

01:34:23.696 --> 01:34:26.490
Hang on. Wait a second.

01:34:43.091 --> 01:34:46.093
- Hello. How you doing?
- Hey. Hi. Good, how are you?

01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:47.595
- Good.
- Good.

01:34:47.763 --> 01:34:50.598
You are looking very beautiful.

01:34:50.766 --> 01:34:52.433
Thank you.

01:34:53.227 --> 01:34:54.394
What is that?

01:34:57.523 --> 01:34:58.731
On your ear.

01:34:59.483 --> 01:35:02.610
- Ear?
- No, your left ear.

01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:04.737
Is that?

01:35:06.782 --> 01:35:07.907
Is that hair gel?

01:35:10.786 --> 01:35:12.912
- Yeah.
- Great. I could use some.

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:15.665
- No, no, no. You don't have to. You don't...
- No, really.

01:35:15.833 --> 01:35:17.500
I just ran out.

01:35:21.505 --> 01:35:23.297
- How we doing over here?
- Okay.

01:35:23.465 --> 01:35:25.174
- Little more wine?
- Sure.

01:35:26.468 --> 01:35:29.887
So when you say killer, you mean...

01:35:30.055 --> 01:35:33.516
- He's a murderer. Yeah.
- Like, an actual convicted murderer?

01:35:33.684 --> 01:35:36.102
He killed people. I know, it's crazy.

01:35:36.270 --> 01:35:39.188
- And, what, did he ever go to jail, or he's...?
- Yeah, in Boston.

01:35:39.356 --> 01:35:41.524
- He spent... I don't know how long.
- He got out?

01:35:41.692 --> 01:35:43.484
Well, it's obvious. The system sucks.

01:35:43.652 --> 01:35:46.028
The guy's walking the streets.
I'm kissing him.

01:35:46.238 --> 01:35:50.116
Right, but you didn't
do anything else, right?

01:35:50.284 --> 01:35:52.618
- What?
- I mean, you didn't...

01:35:55.456 --> 01:35:57.207
- No, no, no.
- No, okay.

01:35:57.375 --> 01:35:59.626
- God, I couldn't live with myself.
- No, I mean...

01:35:59.794 --> 01:36:03.756
I only went out with him a couple times.
but, you know, just the thought of that...

01:36:06.217 --> 01:36:09.094
I shouldn't be putting this all on you,
I'm sorry.

01:36:09.262 --> 01:36:14.475
- We haven't seen each other in so long.
- No, it's just I feel really bad.

01:36:14.642 --> 01:36:17.561
I'm tired of talking about stalkers.
Let's talk about you.

01:36:19.647 --> 01:36:21.899
Are you okay? Yeah?

01:36:22.066 --> 01:36:24.318
- Do you want some water?
- No, I'm good.

01:36:24.694 --> 01:36:28.280
So then in '94, I went back to
Dade Community College for a semester.

01:36:28.448 --> 01:36:33.410
And when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell
through, I hooked up with Peking Pizza.

01:36:33.578 --> 01:36:37.456
Hey, Cat, how about
a couple of brews over here, man?

01:36:38.583 --> 01:36:41.001
Hey, get the fuck out of here.

01:36:41.169 --> 01:36:44.129
I told you 20 times
you're not welcome here anymore.

01:36:44.297 --> 01:36:46.882
Hey, hey, hey, you,
where's that coming from?

01:36:47.050 --> 01:36:50.260
It's coming from you always
skipping out on your tab.

01:36:50.762 --> 01:36:52.471
Hey, I got cash.

01:36:54.182 --> 01:36:56.099
Okay, Norm.

01:36:56.392 --> 01:37:00.270
You pay. I'll pour. In that order.

01:37:01.731 --> 01:37:04.358
- Hey, Tracy, how are the twins?
- Fuck you, Norm.

01:37:04.526 --> 01:37:07.654
That's it,
I like it when you talk dirty to me, man.

01:37:08.656 --> 01:37:09.864
Here you go, big guy.

01:37:10.741 --> 01:37:12.909
Come on, cough it up, chompers.

01:37:16.455 --> 01:37:18.122
Thanks.

01:37:20.084 --> 01:37:22.627
So how the hell did you meet Mary?

01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:25.088
It was just dumb luck, really.

01:37:25.256 --> 01:37:28.758
I delivered a pie to her and she
answered the door in her nightgown...

01:37:28.926 --> 01:37:32.303
...and, wow, that was it for me.

01:37:32.471 --> 01:37:35.306
I went home that night,
shaved my beard, and a week later...

01:37:35.474 --> 01:37:38.142
...I'm laid out in her office
with a broken back.

01:37:38.310 --> 01:37:41.020
Broken back? How'd you do that?

01:37:41.188 --> 01:37:43.982
A friend. Baseball bat.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:46.150
Touché.

01:37:49.238 --> 01:37:51.030
You want another one?

01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:55.118
Sure. Yeah. Hey, Docky.

01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:58.663
- Couple more nitrate-sicles, please.
- Two corn dogs coming up.

01:37:58.831 --> 01:38:02.208
You know, I don't think that they have
enough meats on sticks.

01:38:02.376 --> 01:38:05.378
No, seriously. If you think about it,
they have plenty of sweets.

01:38:05.546 --> 01:38:09.007
They have lollipops,
they have Fudgsicles, they have Popsicles...

01:38:09.174 --> 01:38:11.342
...but they don't have
any other meat on sticks.

01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:14.554
- Yes, you don't see many meats on sticks.
- Absolutely not.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:18.851
You know what I'd like to see?
I'd like to see more meats in a cone.

01:38:19.019 --> 01:38:23.772
You don't hardly ever see that. You know,
that's an idea I think is waiting to pop.

01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:27.526
Just like a nice, you know, nice, big,
oversize waffle-cone...

01:38:27.694 --> 01:38:30.070
...stuffed full of chopped liver.
- Chopped liver.

01:38:30.238 --> 01:38:31.405
Exactly.

01:38:32.782 --> 01:38:34.658
- Too bad you don't live here, Ted.
- Yeah?

01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:37.411
Yeah. We have a lot in common.

01:38:39.539 --> 01:38:41.498
Well, you know, maybe...

01:38:41.666 --> 01:38:45.377
Have you ever thought about
maybe moving back up to Rhode Island?

01:38:45.545 --> 01:38:49.506
I thought about it, but I got too much
of a good thing going on here.

01:38:49.674 --> 01:38:54.595
I got a great practice.
I like the people I work with, and Warren.

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:58.641
You know, maybe you should just. like,
move down here and marry me.

01:39:03.647 --> 01:39:07.650
- So you're a writer.
- Yeah, well, I'm trying to be.

01:39:08.610 --> 01:39:11.695
Well, the good thing about writing
is you can do it anywhere.

01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:13.405
That's true.

01:39:15.408 --> 01:39:20.079
How about you? How did you manage
to stay single all these years?

01:39:21.081 --> 01:39:27.587
Well, I'm bisexual, so that's hard
for a lot of guys to understand.

01:39:29.090 --> 01:39:30.799
- Well...
- You gonna smoke that?

01:39:33.970 --> 01:39:37.097
You know,
I read somewhere that most women...

01:39:37.264 --> 01:39:41.017
...if you really ask them honestly,
have tendencies towards...

01:39:41.185 --> 01:39:45.313
- I mean, everybody has a bit of...
- Ted, I'm fucking with you.

01:39:46.065 --> 01:39:47.649
Yeah.

01:39:49.276 --> 01:39:51.987
Stalking motherfucker.

01:39:52.154 --> 01:39:55.991
I know. It sickens me.

01:39:56.158 --> 01:39:59.786
Actually. I did almost get married once.

01:40:02.039 --> 01:40:03.748
What happened?

01:40:04.625 --> 01:40:07.002
Well, he was a really great guy.

01:40:07.294 --> 01:40:09.295
He lived up north, and...

01:40:10.131 --> 01:40:11.923
Come on. let's go.

01:40:16.637 --> 01:40:18.263
Here you go.

01:40:35.031 --> 01:40:38.117
Wait. How many is this?

01:40:39.286 --> 01:40:41.162
- Four.
- Four?

01:40:41.329 --> 01:40:44.582
That seems like an awful lot of speed
to give one little pooch.

01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:48.502
- Are you sure it won't kill him?
- I never said that.

01:40:51.423 --> 01:40:53.507
Baby.

01:40:59.181 --> 01:41:00.848
Good, good, good.

01:41:01.433 --> 01:41:06.854
And so then it was over.
We really haven't spoken since.

01:41:07.272 --> 01:41:10.149
Wow, sounds like he was almost perfect.

01:41:11.610 --> 01:41:13.402
Almost.

01:41:15.614 --> 01:41:18.365
Hey, you wanna go upstairs
and watch SportsCenter?

01:41:20.619 --> 01:41:23.621
You know, I think I'm just gonna quit
while I'm ahead.

01:41:23.789 --> 01:41:26.123
You're not that far ahead, Ted.

01:41:33.340 --> 01:41:35.257
Magda.

01:41:36.051 --> 01:41:37.384
What are you doing?

01:41:37.552 --> 01:41:40.054
Hi, hon. Just straightening up.

01:41:44.976 --> 01:41:46.186
Put that down.

01:41:48.689 --> 01:41:50.482
Magda.

01:41:51.067 --> 01:41:52.734
Thanks, doll.

01:41:55.071 --> 01:41:57.239
Magda. Magda.

01:41:57.406 --> 01:42:00.075
Honey, where is Puffy?

01:42:00.243 --> 01:42:02.410
He was being a pest.
I put him in the bathroom.

01:42:02.578 --> 01:42:04.079
Really?

01:42:05.498 --> 01:42:07.124
Ted?

01:42:07.834 --> 01:42:10.794
Can you do me a favor?
Would you mind letting the dog out?

01:42:10.962 --> 01:42:13.505
I think I should have a talk
with Magda here.

01:42:13.673 --> 01:42:15.340
Sure, yeah.

01:42:18.136 --> 01:42:19.344
- Over here.
- Where?

01:42:19.512 --> 01:42:21.721
- Here. Fine.
- Good. What's going on?

01:42:22.348 --> 01:42:23.974
More cleaning.

01:42:24.267 --> 01:42:26.601
- How much coffee did you have tonight?
- None.

01:42:29.814 --> 01:42:31.439
Mary?

01:42:32.441 --> 01:42:34.651
What kind of dog is Puffy?

01:42:34.819 --> 01:42:38.905
- Border terrier.
- Border terrier. Like Benji.

01:42:48.374 --> 01:42:52.127
Hey.

01:42:52.295 --> 01:42:55.923
Are you the little guy
making all that big noise?

01:43:02.139 --> 01:43:03.181
Oh, Ted!

01:43:13.734 --> 01:43:14.775
Puffy, stop it!

01:43:17.821 --> 01:43:19.488
Take a little bit of this.

01:43:21.867 --> 01:43:23.701
Puffy. Puffy.

01:43:30.542 --> 01:43:31.584
Puffy!

01:43:47.476 --> 01:43:49.268
That's all you got, pal?

01:43:54.066 --> 01:43:59.695
Ted.

01:44:05.662 --> 01:44:07.746
No, no, no.

01:44:30.979 --> 01:44:32.521
Puffy!

01:44:33.564 --> 01:44:36.858
Puffy! Puffy! Puffy!

01:44:42.573 --> 01:44:44.700
How do you know that I'm right?

01:44:44.867 --> 01:44:48.495
Well, you know. No, I don't.

01:44:48.663 --> 01:44:51.373
- You want a grape?
- A grape? Sure.

01:44:52.667 --> 01:44:54.501
- Ready?
- Yeah.

01:44:55.128 --> 01:44:58.505
All net. All net. We make a good team.

01:45:28.495 --> 01:45:30.079
Hey. Come on. Want a go?

01:45:30.247 --> 01:45:32.165
- Closer?
- Don't be afraid. It's all right.

01:45:32.332 --> 01:45:36.210
Get in closer. That's good. Don't be afraid.
Get right in there. A little bit more.

01:45:36.378 --> 01:45:39.839
Good. He'll be fine.
Mary, you're being overprotective.

01:46:13.082 --> 01:46:15.166
No, no, no. We already... We got...

01:46:24.552 --> 01:46:26.303
Come on, come on.

01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.935
Warren. Warren.

01:46:33.103 --> 01:46:35.562
- Warren.
- Warren.

01:46:37.816 --> 01:46:39.775
Warren.

01:46:42.278 --> 01:46:45.781
- Warren.
- Warren, come here. Stop.

01:46:48.284 --> 01:46:50.619
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:46:50.787 --> 01:46:53.372
Hey. Hey.

01:46:54.249 --> 01:46:57.626
- It's his fault. He hit me with that stuff.
- Here, let me help with that.

01:46:57.794 --> 01:46:59.753
Warren! Warren!

01:47:24.529 --> 01:47:27.990
I didn't do it. He got in the way.

01:47:28.158 --> 01:47:30.784
I know. I know, I know.
Does anybody have any pliers?

01:47:30.952 --> 01:47:34.622
Needle-nose, otherwise? Anything?

01:47:43.507 --> 01:47:45.091
Hey.

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:50.972
Flowers are for you, ball is for Warren.
Had a friend FedEx it from Boston.

01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:54.017
Signed by Tony Conigliaro.

01:47:54.185 --> 01:47:57.854
Did you hire Pat Healy to spy on me?

01:48:00.024 --> 01:48:01.524
What?

01:48:02.776 --> 01:48:04.861
What are you talking about?

01:48:05.446 --> 01:48:07.906
I got an anonymous letter.

01:48:09.241 --> 01:48:10.867
It's not true, right, Ted?

01:48:15.206 --> 01:48:20.210
Well, it's an interesting thing
that happened. I...

01:48:21.545 --> 01:48:23.713
Yeah, it's true, but it's not...

01:48:23.881 --> 01:48:26.633
Okay. Get out.

01:48:27.218 --> 01:48:30.136
Mary, wait.
First of all, I didn't know that this guy was...

01:48:30.304 --> 01:48:32.055
What, that he was a murderer?

01:48:32.223 --> 01:48:34.599
That, yeah.
in addition to many other things.

01:48:34.767 --> 01:48:37.727
I mean, I didn't know anything
about the guy. I hardly know him.

01:48:37.895 --> 01:48:39.312
How could you do that, Ted?

01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:44.068
How could you have some guy
you don't even know spy on me?

01:48:44.569 --> 01:48:46.862
What were you trying to do?

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.408
Trick me into feeling something for you?

01:48:54.329 --> 01:48:56.538
No. I didn't...

01:48:56.748 --> 01:48:58.415
I didn't wanna trick you.

01:49:00.252 --> 01:49:03.087
Just leave. Okay?

01:49:04.506 --> 01:49:05.547
Mary.

01:49:06.591 --> 01:49:08.175
Go.

01:49:18.478 --> 01:49:22.147
I did it because I never stopped
thinking about you.

01:49:22.983 --> 01:49:27.069
And if I didn't find you, I knew that my life
would never, ever be good again.

01:50:11.282 --> 01:50:12.657
Hey.

01:50:12.867 --> 01:50:15.618
Healy. You in there?

01:50:20.958 --> 01:50:22.500
Hello?

01:50:38.017 --> 01:50:42.854
And it was going along just fine
until you showed up.

01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:47.609
Holy shit.

01:50:47.902 --> 01:50:50.820
This is a pretty nice place.

01:50:51.572 --> 01:50:54.366
Sully, what the fuck happened?

01:50:54.533 --> 01:50:57.827
- Hey, surprise.
- Hey, peace, man. Come on.

01:50:57.995 --> 01:50:59.913
- You fucked me, man.
- Wait. Come on.

01:51:00.081 --> 01:51:04.418
- Man, don't do anything rash now, buddy.
- Who the fuck is this guy?

01:51:05.921 --> 01:51:09.715
That's Norm. He's a pizza boy.
He's in love with Mary too.

01:51:10.384 --> 01:51:11.592
Look, come on, man.

01:51:12.010 --> 01:51:15.846
All right. Look. I think everybody
could use a drink right now.

01:51:16.014 --> 01:51:17.348
I don't want a drink.

01:51:17.808 --> 01:51:20.810
- Fuck you.
- Hey, hey, hey. Look.

01:51:21.311 --> 01:51:23.979
You asked me to follow around your girl
and I did.

01:51:24.815 --> 01:51:29.151
And then the truth is, I started to like her.

01:51:30.278 --> 01:51:33.948
And that's when I realized I couldn't
in good conscience bring myself to do it.

01:51:35.409 --> 01:51:36.450
Do what?

01:51:37.452 --> 01:51:39.995
Turn her over to a violent stalker.

01:51:40.163 --> 01:51:43.207
Oh, I'm a stalker?
You're calling me a violent stalker?

01:51:43.375 --> 01:51:46.335
- Oh, yeah. Sure.
- I'm a...?

01:51:48.839 --> 01:51:50.840
Oh, my God.

01:51:53.176 --> 01:51:54.677
That poor dog.

01:51:56.012 --> 01:51:57.471
- Hey, fuck you.
- Fuck you.

01:51:57.639 --> 01:51:59.890
You just can't take the fact
that it was my turn.

01:52:00.058 --> 01:52:03.060
- Your turn?
- Yeah, that's right. My turn.

01:52:03.812 --> 01:52:06.522
Why can't I ever get a girl like Mary?

01:52:07.107 --> 01:52:10.901
Just because you didn't get her, you didn't
have to blow us both out of the water.

01:52:11.403 --> 01:52:12.862
What are you talking about?

01:52:13.322 --> 01:52:16.241
You're gonna tell me
you didn't write her an anonymous letter...

01:52:16.409 --> 01:52:18.577
...telling her about
our whole deal together?

01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:20.412
What letter?

01:52:21.914 --> 01:52:23.540
Come on.

01:52:25.209 --> 01:52:26.209
It was you.

01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:31.715
You sent the letter.

01:52:31.966 --> 01:52:33.675
It was you.

01:52:34.010 --> 01:52:37.888
We had a deal. You said you wouldn't
fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you...

01:52:38.055 --> 01:52:41.558
...until we got this fuck
out of the fucking picture.

01:52:41.726 --> 01:52:44.519
- You crossed the line, man.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, man.

01:52:44.687 --> 01:52:48.231
You're getting crazy now.
Why would I cross the line?

01:52:49.233 --> 01:52:51.610
You probably did it yourself,
you piece of shit.

01:52:51.777 --> 01:52:55.322
Oh, yeah. That makes a lot of sense.
Why would I rat myself out?

01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:57.491
Like I'm gonna
try to figure out some guy...

01:52:57.658 --> 01:53:01.161
...whose idea of courting
is blowing farts in her face.

01:53:01.329 --> 01:53:06.875
- You were following us.
- Don't flatter yourself. I was following her.

01:53:08.461 --> 01:53:10.587
I always do.

01:53:11.005 --> 01:53:14.591
How the hell do you think
I got rid of the last guy, Brett?

01:53:15.259 --> 01:53:20.680
Wait, Brett? Are you saying that Brett
didn't say those things about Warren?

01:53:21.849 --> 01:53:25.770
Are you shitting me?
Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes?

01:53:25.938 --> 01:53:28.439
He was like an Eagle Scout.

01:53:28.649 --> 01:53:32.693
Wait a minute. You two should be kissing
my fucking hairy beanbag, you know?

01:53:32.861 --> 01:53:35.988
Because if it wasn't for me,
she might have married that schmuck.

01:53:38.450 --> 01:53:40.284
I feel sick.

01:53:40.744 --> 01:53:42.745
Both of you are just...

01:53:43.872 --> 01:53:45.665
I'm out of here.

01:53:46.625 --> 01:53:48.334
Yeah.

01:53:49.711 --> 01:53:53.965
You know, if it wasn't you who sent
the letter and I never sent it...

01:53:54.383 --> 01:53:56.175
...who sent it?

01:54:00.472 --> 01:54:02.056
Oh, hey. Hal.

01:54:02.224 --> 01:54:05.893
I was worried about you. I thought that...

01:54:07.980 --> 01:54:09.981
Oh, Sully.

01:54:23.495 --> 01:54:25.079
Oh, my...

01:54:25.706 --> 01:54:26.747
Woogie?

01:54:27.541 --> 01:54:29.542
Who the hell is Woogie?

01:54:32.630 --> 01:54:34.256
Hello.

01:54:36.134 --> 01:54:37.634
What are you doing here?

01:54:38.886 --> 01:54:42.139
Did you get my letter, Mare?
The one about Ted?

01:54:44.225 --> 01:54:45.267
You sent that?

01:54:48.521 --> 01:54:51.648
I was worried about you.

01:54:51.816 --> 01:54:55.861
Woogie, you know you're not
supposed to be within 400 yards of me.

01:54:56.029 --> 01:54:58.864
Yeah, I know. I do. In fact, you know...

01:54:59.032 --> 01:55:01.700
...that's what I really wanted
to talk to you about.

01:55:01.868 --> 01:55:07.998
You know that I have actually been through
nine years of intensive psychotherapy.

01:55:08.166 --> 01:55:12.169
And you know something?
You were absolutely right. I needed help.

01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:17.507
That's great. Woogie.
I mean, I'm glad you're doing better.

01:55:17.675 --> 01:55:19.259
You look...

01:55:20.011 --> 01:55:22.220
- You look good.
- Thank you.

01:55:22.680 --> 01:55:25.641
Except for the rash thing's still there,
right?

01:55:25.808 --> 01:55:30.395
Yes. You noticed, huh?
These are called love blisters.

01:55:30.563 --> 01:55:35.984
They went away for a little while,
but then you came back in my life, milady.

01:55:37.403 --> 01:55:42.325
Woogie, I did not come back
into your life. Okay?

01:55:42.493 --> 01:55:45.328
I don't even know how you found me.
Let's not forget, here.

01:55:45.496 --> 01:55:48.331
You put me through a lot of bullshit,
okay?

01:55:48.499 --> 01:55:52.919
I had to change my name,
I had to go to court. I moved.

01:55:53.087 --> 01:55:55.171
I mean, you stole all of my shoes.

01:55:56.256 --> 01:55:59.092
What? What are you talking about?

01:55:59.259 --> 01:56:01.511
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.

01:56:02.846 --> 01:56:05.515
I was in a weird place then. Mary.

01:56:06.183 --> 01:56:10.144
Come on. Okay? Come on.

01:56:10.312 --> 01:56:14.399
Give me a break here, okay?
I was a little nuts, a little...

01:56:14.566 --> 01:56:16.651
But I'm fine.

01:56:16.819 --> 01:56:20.780
Woogie, you're starting
to make me a little nervous.

01:56:21.949 --> 01:56:24.450
I'm making you feel nervous?
Nervous? What's that?

01:56:24.618 --> 01:56:27.704
I wouldn't know anything about nervous.
Jeez.

01:56:27.871 --> 01:56:31.332
You ever had a whitehead
on your eyeball, Mary?

01:56:31.500 --> 01:56:34.293
Woogie, I'm asking you to leave.

01:56:34.461 --> 01:56:38.715
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Mary, you got this all wrong.

01:56:38.882 --> 01:56:40.842
I'm not going anywhere.

01:56:42.302 --> 01:56:45.138
Not until I get something
to remember you by.

01:56:47.307 --> 01:56:49.684
Get your hands out of there.

01:56:50.519 --> 01:56:52.312
- No. Woogie.
- Yeah.

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:53.772
Let go.

01:56:54.524 --> 01:56:56.108
Stop it. Stop!

01:56:56.276 --> 01:57:00.612
Just one pair. You owe me that,
you heartless bitch.

01:57:01.239 --> 01:57:04.283
What the...? Hey.

01:57:09.247 --> 01:57:12.624
Dom? You're pathetic.

01:57:13.084 --> 01:57:16.962
Tucker, what happened to your crutches?

01:57:17.547 --> 01:57:19.339
Yeah, well...

01:57:19.507 --> 01:57:21.800
Yes, very good query, Mary. Well done.

01:57:21.968 --> 01:57:24.428
Come on. Tell her the truth, pizza boy.

01:57:28.391 --> 01:57:30.350
Name's Norm.

01:57:30.518 --> 01:57:34.229
I live with my folks up in Pompano. Hey.

01:57:35.857 --> 01:57:39.735
Oh, man.
This is like group therapy or something.

01:57:39.903 --> 01:57:41.695
Dom. What are you doing here?

01:57:42.238 --> 01:57:45.949
You stole her from me,
and now I want her back.

01:57:46.117 --> 01:57:48.660
I stole her from you?
What are you talking about?

01:57:49.746 --> 01:57:52.831
Woogie. How many times
did I tell you this at Princeton?

01:57:53.416 --> 01:57:56.502
- Woogie?
- Ted and I had one date.

01:57:56.669 --> 01:57:59.254
- You and I were already broken up.
- You're Woogie?

01:58:00.215 --> 01:58:02.425
Dom Woganowski.

01:58:04.094 --> 01:58:08.598
But you're married.
You have a wife, beautiful kids.

01:58:08.766 --> 01:58:11.559
Ted, if you love them so much,
please, be my guest.

01:58:11.727 --> 01:58:16.731
All right, what the hell is going on here?
Can someone explain it to me?

01:58:17.191 --> 01:58:20.860
Look, we're all in love with Mary.

01:58:22.029 --> 01:58:23.404
Oh, God.

01:58:24.031 --> 01:58:27.283
If I may, I have a proposal.

01:58:27.785 --> 01:58:30.745
I say none of us leaves this room...

01:58:30.913 --> 01:58:34.123
...until our young Mary here
stops jerking us around...

01:58:34.291 --> 01:58:38.211
...and decides, once and for all,
who she really wants.

01:58:40.464 --> 01:58:43.341
Now, Mary, I know this is tough...

01:58:44.009 --> 01:58:49.138
...but you really will be doing them all
a great favor to tell them the truth about us.

01:58:49.306 --> 01:58:52.684
Are you crazy? What makes you think
I would pick you anyhow?

01:58:52.852 --> 01:58:55.019
I mean, you're a murderer.

01:58:57.481 --> 01:59:02.944
Well, I may have been blowing
a little smoke up your ass there, Mary.

01:59:03.112 --> 01:59:04.696
I'm sorry.

01:59:07.658 --> 01:59:10.910
- Touchdown.
- Hi, Mary.

01:59:11.663 --> 01:59:14.957
- Brett?
- What the hell is Brett Favre doing here?

01:59:15.125 --> 01:59:17.334
I'm in town to play the Dolphins,
you dumb-ass.

01:59:17.502 --> 01:59:21.338
Yeah. I called him, Mary. I told him
to pick up Warren and get down here.

01:59:21.506 --> 01:59:25.634
See, your friend Tucker
was lying about a couple of other things.

01:59:25.802 --> 01:59:27.970
Brett never said
those bad things about Warren.

01:59:28.138 --> 01:59:29.847
He loves Warren.

01:59:30.015 --> 01:59:34.476
And from what he told me on the phone
just now, he loves you too.

01:59:34.644 --> 01:59:36.896
He's the guy you should be with.

01:59:41.026 --> 01:59:44.737
That's right, Mary.
You know I'll always be true to you.

01:59:45.071 --> 01:59:48.198
Shit. This isn't fair. Jesus.

01:59:48.366 --> 01:59:50.492
You know, I feel like an idiot.

01:59:51.036 --> 01:59:56.165
See, I realized something today.
I'm no better than any of these guys.

01:59:56.666 --> 02:00:00.044
I mean, none of them love you, really.

02:00:01.171 --> 02:00:05.549
They're just fixated on you because of how
you make them feel about themselves.

02:00:05.717 --> 02:00:08.677
I mean, that's not real love. That's...

02:00:09.679 --> 02:00:10.971
I don't know what that is.

02:00:12.432 --> 02:00:15.559
Please, Mary, don't listen to him.

02:00:15.727 --> 02:00:18.395
This is just another one of his
stupid little ploys.

02:00:18.563 --> 02:00:20.898
You know, Stroehmann,
you are so full of shit.

02:00:21.066 --> 02:00:24.945
- Yeah. You're the biggest stalker of us all.
- You're gonna stand here and tell me...

02:00:25.112 --> 02:00:27.530
...that you're not nuts about this girl?

02:00:28.074 --> 02:00:29.991
Yeah, that's what I'm telling you.

02:00:33.913 --> 02:00:36.748
- Hey, good luck, Brett.
- Yeah. Thank you.

02:00:36.916 --> 02:00:39.834
She's a great gal. Take care of her.

02:00:41.420 --> 02:00:43.046
I'll see you, Mary.

02:00:43.965 --> 02:00:45.382
Bye, Ted.

02:00:48.302 --> 02:00:52.305
- Hey, Warren, see you later.
- Okay, goodbye, Ted.

02:00:54.141 --> 02:00:55.725
Goodbye.

02:00:57.103 --> 02:00:59.312
God, Mary, I've missed you.

02:00:59.647 --> 02:01:00.689
Hey, Brett.

02:01:00.856 --> 02:01:04.025
What are the chances I could get you
to give me a little autograph?

02:01:04.193 --> 02:01:06.194
- Something nice to the wife and kids.
- What?

02:01:06.362 --> 02:01:08.613
Oh, shut up. Cock tease.

02:01:35.183 --> 02:01:39.603
Well, she's back with her old boyfriend

02:01:39.771 --> 02:01:44.066
He don't challenge her
He don't contend with her

02:01:44.234 --> 02:01:48.529
And she don't answer the cards you send

02:01:48.697 --> 02:01:52.658
And you're jealous of the time
That he spend with her

02:01:52.826 --> 02:01:57.038
Just let her go into the darkness

02:01:57.664 --> 02:02:02.001
Let her live for all the things there

02:02:02.169 --> 02:02:06.338
Let her go into the darkness

02:02:06.506 --> 02:02:10.551
Let her go, let her go, let her go

02:02:34.326 --> 02:02:35.868
Ted.

02:02:37.704 --> 02:02:39.330
Mary?

02:02:41.250 --> 02:02:43.043
Ted.

02:02:44.045 --> 02:02:45.712
Mary.

02:02:47.882 --> 02:02:49.466
Ted.

02:02:53.429 --> 02:02:54.930
You forgot your keys.

02:03:08.778 --> 02:03:10.862
Did you really mean
what you said up there?

02:03:14.575 --> 02:03:16.827
I just want you to be happy, Mary.

02:03:20.915 --> 02:03:23.041
But I'd be happiest with you.

02:03:27.588 --> 02:03:29.131
You're fucking with me, right?

02:03:33.719 --> 02:03:38.390
What about Brett Favre?

02:03:40.351 --> 02:03:43.103
What did I tell you the first time we met?

02:03:43.604 --> 02:03:45.230
I'm a Niners fan.

02:03:58.162 --> 02:04:03.541
His friends would say
"Stop whining." they've had enough of that

02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:08.880
His friends would say
"Stop pining, there's other girls to look at"

02:04:09.339 --> 02:04:14.135
They've tried to set him up
With Tiffany and Indigo

02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:20.057
But there's something about Mary
That they don't know

02:04:20.225 --> 02:04:21.350
What are you doing?

02:04:21.518 --> 02:04:25.062
- That's my girl he's kissing.
- But you just slept with me.

02:04:25.230 --> 02:04:27.690
I was only boning you to get to Mary.
