00:01.467 --> 00:04.469
Does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>Tool time!</i>

00:04.470 --> 00:06.370
That's right. Now, here he is,
the star of the show,

00:06.371 --> 00:08.974
Tim "the tool man" taylor.

00:12.544 --> 00:16.379
Thank you. Thank you, heidi.
Thank you, everyone.

00:16.381 --> 00:19.751
Welcome to security week
here on <i>tool time.</i>

00:19.752 --> 00:22.453
You all know me.
I'm tim "the secure man" taylor,

00:22.454 --> 00:27.058
And my assistant,
al "I want my blankie" borland.

00:27.059 --> 00:29.060
I'd respond to that,
but I don't need to

00:29.061 --> 00:31.195
Because I'm very secure
with who I am.

00:31.196 --> 00:33.832
Well, you shouldn't be. Ok.

00:33.833 --> 00:36.735
Now, folks, <i>tool time</i> isn't
just about home improvement -

00:36.736 --> 00:40.304
It's also about protecting
that home you have improved.

00:40.305 --> 00:43.775
Right, and a good place to start
is with the proper locks.

00:43.776 --> 00:45.777
Now, there are all types
of locks -

00:45.778 --> 00:48.579
Chain locks, guarder locks,
deadbolt locks...

00:48.580 --> 00:52.150
My favorite bagel and lox.
Yeah!

00:52.151 --> 00:54.686
I go with nova scotia lox.
Al likes belly lox.

00:54.687 --> 00:58.056
But remember, a little lox
goes a long way.

01:03.095 --> 01:05.730
We also have a home
security system.
Yeah, yeah.

01:05.731 --> 01:07.498
Burglar systems are fine,

01:07.499 --> 01:10.601
But when do we get
to the high-energy
surveillance equipment?

01:10.602 --> 01:12.837
Heidi, the high-energy
surveillance equipment, please.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.713
Here you are, tim.

01:24.516 --> 01:27.152
Look at this stuff.
Small surveillance cameras,

01:27.153 --> 01:29.620
Infrared scopes,
pocket bug-detectors.

01:29.621 --> 01:34.358
Tim, we're talking home
security, not cracking
an international spy ring.

01:34.359 --> 01:36.627
Yeah, al, but with this stuff,
you got the option.

01:36.628 --> 01:38.997
Now, a must on the shopping list

01:38.998 --> 01:41.966
For every do-it-yourself spy
is the bionic ear.

01:41.967 --> 01:45.570
With this, you can pick up
conversations a long way away.
Watch.

01:45.571 --> 01:51.342
<i>(man)</i> <i>maurice, qu'est-ce que</i>
<i>tu as pensé de "tool time"?</i>

01:51.343 --> 01:53.277
<i>(maurice) c'était très amusant,</i>

01:53.278 --> 01:58.583
<i>Mais l'assistant, al borland,</i>
<i>était un grand "bozo."</i>

02:02.054 --> 02:05.256
And you're expecting me
to believe that they watch
<i>tool time</i> in France?

02:05.257 --> 02:07.859
Well, not anymore.
You heard what maurice
said about you.

02:09.561 --> 02:13.664
Now it's time for
the night-vision goggles.

02:13.665 --> 02:16.034
Night-vision goggles?

02:19.638 --> 02:23.074
With these bad boys, you can
walk around in pitch black,
pick out a burglar.

02:23.075 --> 02:25.576
And you'll never
whiz wide of the bowl again.

02:29.115 --> 02:33.484
What these things do is great,
is amplify existing light,
like, 2,000 times,

02:33.485 --> 02:35.553
Just by flicking
this switch.

02:35.554 --> 02:38.289
Oh!

02:38.290 --> 02:40.491
It's like looking into
the surface of the sun,
isn't it?

02:40.492 --> 02:42.927
I'm over here, al.
Over here.

02:42.928 --> 02:45.429
Actually, these are...

02:45.430 --> 02:49.567
These are designed for using
when it's totally dark.

02:49.568 --> 02:52.737
Heidi, make it
totally dark, please.

02:52.738 --> 02:55.273
I'll just switch mine on.
There! Wow!

02:55.274 --> 02:59.043
<i>(al)</i> oh, well,
now mine aren't working.

02:59.044 --> 03:02.346
<i>(tim)</i> I'll just adjust them.
Let me grab a screwdriver
out of your tool belt here.

03:02.347 --> 03:05.116
<i>(al)</i> tim.
That's not my screwdriver.

03:58.270 --> 04:00.371
Well, jill, I gotta
hand it to you.

04:00.372 --> 04:03.274
How do you find time to cook
with your finals coming up?

04:03.275 --> 04:06.878
Well, I did find this book -
<i>five-minute meals</i>
<i>for the busy woman.</i>

04:06.879 --> 04:09.113
You should try
the spaghetti sauce.
Tell me what you think of it.

04:09.114 --> 04:11.415
All right.

04:11.416 --> 04:13.151
Mm.

04:13.152 --> 04:16.420
Maybe if you throw the book
in the pot, it might give it
some flavor.

04:18.656 --> 04:21.926
Oh, well. Tim and the boys
are just gonna have
to put up with it

04:21.927 --> 04:24.062
Until all my finals
are over with.

04:24.063 --> 04:26.364
Hi, guys.
Oh, hi.

04:26.365 --> 04:29.033
Anyway, I just don't have time
to cook the way I usually do.

04:29.034 --> 04:33.004
Now, there's some good news.

04:33.005 --> 04:36.007
Wait till he sees
the new book I got.

04:36.008 --> 04:39.510
<i>Five-minute lovemaking.</i>

04:39.511 --> 04:41.880
What are we gonna do
with the other three minutes?

04:43.482 --> 04:46.985
Hey, guys, guess what.
Barry hudson quit
his newspaper route.

04:46.986 --> 04:48.519
Hi, marie.
Hey.

04:48.520 --> 04:51.589
Now we won't need the ladder
to get the paper off the roof.

04:51.590 --> 04:55.293
I don't mind climbing up
on the roof every day
to get our paper.

04:55.294 --> 04:58.396
That way I don't have
to spring for a stairmaster.

04:58.397 --> 05:01.299
I'll see you guys later.
Oh, bye.

05:01.300 --> 05:03.401
Well, barry talked
to the newspaper,

05:03.402 --> 05:05.937
And they said if I want
the job I can take it.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.638
Great.

05:07.639 --> 05:11.609
There's nothing like
a challenge
to help someone mature.

05:11.610 --> 05:14.512
Maybe we ought to get
your father a paper route.

05:14.513 --> 05:18.883
I had a paper route.
It's the kind of job
that turns a boy into a man.

05:18.884 --> 05:21.185
So I can take it?
Absolutely.

05:21.186 --> 05:23.754
Not so fast.
Not so fast.

05:25.357 --> 05:27.058
Why not so fast?

05:27.059 --> 05:30.061
Well, brad, you have a lot
more schoolwork this year.

05:30.062 --> 05:32.696
You've got band, basketball,
a girlfriend.

05:32.697 --> 05:34.498
Don't you think
you're taking on too much?

05:34.499 --> 05:38.036
I know it's a lot, but,
mom, I can handle it.
What does it pay?

05:38.037 --> 05:41.973
75 bucks a week.
75 dollars a week.

05:45.510 --> 05:47.611
You're gonna have
to be getting up
at the crack of dawn

05:47.612 --> 05:49.547
When it's, like,
seven below outside.

05:49.548 --> 05:51.649
I can do it.
That's right.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.184
It's good to push him
a little bit.

05:53.185 --> 05:55.820
Besides, getting up at 5:00
will put hair on your chest,

05:55.821 --> 05:58.589
Which is why you don't see
too many newspaper girls.

05:59.992 --> 06:03.761
And, mom, I promise I won't
fall behind on anything.

06:03.762 --> 06:07.898
I'll clean my room, and I'll
even practice my saxophone
two hours a night.

06:07.899 --> 06:10.168
You don't do that now.

06:10.169 --> 06:12.437
We've talked about giving
the boys more responsibility.

06:12.438 --> 06:15.739
I think this falls
in that category.

06:15.740 --> 06:19.477
Well, ok. I have my doubts,
but if that's the way you
see it, tim, all right.

06:19.478 --> 06:21.779
All right.

06:21.780 --> 06:25.216
Now, the minute that your
schoolwork starts to suffer,
the job is over.

06:25.217 --> 06:26.884
It's a deal.
That's right.

06:26.885 --> 06:29.887
Well, I think I see
a chest hair sprouting.

06:29.888 --> 06:32.790
Nope. Navel lint.

06:38.330 --> 06:39.964
Hey, jill.

06:39.965 --> 06:42.233
I know you're under the gun
with your finals,

06:42.234 --> 06:44.535
So I made you some lasagna.

06:44.536 --> 06:47.671
You cooked for me?
That is so sweet.

06:47.672 --> 06:51.575
I figured if I didn't,
you might have
a five-minute marriage.

06:51.576 --> 06:54.412
I don't know how
to thank you.
Oh, don't worry about it.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.848
When you become a psychologist,
you can give me a discount
on therapy.

06:57.849 --> 07:00.684
For you, three neuroses
for the price of one.

07:00.685 --> 07:04.889
Then I just have
to figure out what to do
with my other 27 neuroses.

07:04.890 --> 07:06.891
I want to try it.
Here you go.

07:06.892 --> 07:08.626
Let me see.

07:08.627 --> 07:11.562
Oh, it's so good.
Oh, thanks.

07:11.563 --> 07:15.500
Hey, you know, brad is doing
really great with his job.

07:15.501 --> 07:18.769
You know, I had my doubts,
but it's going really well.

07:18.770 --> 07:21.539
You're not kidding.
His throw is so accurate.

07:21.540 --> 07:26.977
All I have to do is open
the door and the paper hits
joe right in the head.

07:26.978 --> 07:29.980
Come to think of it,
it saves me the trouble.

07:29.981 --> 07:31.982
Hello, marie.
Hi, honey.

07:31.983 --> 07:33.984
<i>(marie)</i> hey, tim.

07:33.985 --> 07:35.686
<i>(sniffs, whistles)</i>
<i>(jill)</i> hi.

07:35.687 --> 07:39.823
Something smells great.
Did you order out again?

07:41.293 --> 07:44.328
No. Marie knew
how busy I was,

07:44.329 --> 07:46.664
And look,
she cooked us dinner.

07:46.665 --> 07:50.268
Ah, looks like lasagna.

07:50.269 --> 07:53.671
Smells like lasagna.

07:53.672 --> 07:55.239
Hm...

07:57.676 --> 08:01.546
Important here...
Her lasagna tastes
like lasagna.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.321
You wanna play football?
Oh, no.

09:17.322 --> 09:19.790
I can't. I'm way behind.

09:19.791 --> 09:24.228
I've got this paper on
the franco-prussian war
due tomorrow.

09:24.229 --> 09:26.631
Well, what do you
have so far?

09:28.200 --> 09:32.036
"the franco-prussian war
was..."

09:35.174 --> 09:36.340
That's it?

09:36.341 --> 09:41.212
Yeah, and I copied that
out of the encyclopedia.

09:41.213 --> 09:43.981
Well, you know,
if you make the margins wider,

09:43.982 --> 09:46.050
It might make it seem longer.

09:49.288 --> 09:52.456
I'm gonna have to stay up
all night to finish this.

09:52.457 --> 09:54.258
This job's gonna kill me.

09:54.259 --> 09:57.395
If it does, can I have
my room back?

09:57.396 --> 10:01.065
If this job's so tough, I mean,
why don't you just quit?

10:01.066 --> 10:05.269
I can't.
I already told mom and dad
that I can handle it.

10:05.270 --> 10:08.506
I gotta show them
that I'm up to the challenge
like a real man.

10:08.507 --> 10:10.774
Well, if you keep on handing
in papers like this,

10:10.775 --> 10:15.213
You're gonna be the only
real man still stuck
in the eighth grade.

10:20.319 --> 10:24.655
How did I get myself into this?
I'm behind in everything.

10:24.656 --> 10:27.658
I don't know. Maybe I should
just tell them the truth.

10:27.659 --> 10:29.793
I think you're gonna
have to...

10:29.794 --> 10:33.531
Even though it does go against
everything I believe in.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.102
Hey, guys.
Bye, dad.

10:38.103 --> 10:40.338
So how's my junior
breadwinner doing?

10:40.339 --> 10:44.242
I'm tired, every bone
in my body aches,
and I can't see straight.

10:44.243 --> 10:47.712
Yeah, welcome
to the working world, huh?

10:47.713 --> 10:50.615
I'm real proud of you.
That's why I did this.

10:50.616 --> 10:52.816
You framed my first paycheck?

10:52.817 --> 10:55.018
No. I perma plaqued it.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.290
That baby will be
in there forever.

10:59.291 --> 11:02.226
How am I supposed
to cash it?

11:12.304 --> 11:15.740
You make an interesting point.

11:15.741 --> 11:18.509
I'll just give you the cash.

11:18.510 --> 11:21.111
Dad, about the job...

11:21.112 --> 11:23.414
Aw, you'll love the job.

11:23.415 --> 11:26.183
Your mom didn't think
you could handle it,
but we proved her wrong.

11:26.184 --> 11:28.719
I need to talk to you
about that.

11:28.720 --> 11:30.454
I'm not so sure
I can handle it.

11:30.455 --> 11:32.089
What are you talking about?
Sure you can.

11:32.090 --> 11:34.191
Dad, it's really tough.
Yeah.

11:34.192 --> 11:37.662
I'm thinking that maybe
I should just quit.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

11:37.663 --> 11:40.598
I don't want to hear, "I quit."
taylor men don't quit.

11:40.599 --> 11:43.534
I never quit a job
in my life.
I know, but I'm... I...

11:43.535 --> 11:45.869
You took on a responsibility,
I stood up for you.

11:45.870 --> 11:47.672
You've gotta follow
this thing through.
You really do.

11:47.673 --> 11:49.573
But, dad, I've got
so much going on right now.

11:49.574 --> 11:51.575
Oh, come on. Every job's
tough to start out with.

11:51.576 --> 11:54.312
You'll pull through.
Come on, buddy.
I can't keep up with everything.

11:54.313 --> 11:57.348
Yes, you can. Look.
You're doing your studies.
Look at this. Um...

11:57.349 --> 12:01.018
Look.
"the franco-prussian war was..."

12:01.019 --> 12:04.988
That's already more than
I know, right there.

12:04.989 --> 12:10.328
Hey, but russia's not spelled
with a p, my friend.

12:10.329 --> 12:13.096
That says "prussian."

12:24.443 --> 12:27.244
Hey, brad, mom and dad
want you to come down
for dinner.

12:27.245 --> 12:29.313
Tell them I'm not hungry.

12:29.314 --> 12:34.117
I'm trying to finish this paper
and do my math homework
at the same time.

12:34.118 --> 12:38.288
"the franco-prussian war
was fought in the year 1870

12:38.289 --> 12:42.125
Minus the square root of 113."

12:44.295 --> 12:48.131
Oh, man.
How could I have done that?

12:48.132 --> 12:50.133
I'm never gonna get
this paper in.

12:50.134 --> 12:52.703
My teacher only gave me
an extension till tomorrow.

12:52.704 --> 12:54.304
I'm dead.

12:54.305 --> 12:56.306
Well, you're gonna be
even deader

12:56.307 --> 12:59.943
When mom sees the mess
in your room.

12:59.944 --> 13:02.580
Whoa.

13:02.581 --> 13:06.316
This place is disgusting.

13:06.317 --> 13:09.052
I like it.

13:09.053 --> 13:13.223
You know, brad, you got
a big problem...

13:13.224 --> 13:15.793
But maybe we can help.
How?

13:15.794 --> 13:18.061
Well, I can do your homework,

13:18.062 --> 13:20.865
And mark here will clean
your room.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.967
No, I won't.

13:23.968 --> 13:25.969
Mark, we're brothers.

13:25.970 --> 13:28.171
Brothers do things
for each other.

13:28.172 --> 13:31.375
No, we don't.

13:31.376 --> 13:34.578
For money, we do.

13:34.579 --> 13:36.614
How much do I have
to pay you?

13:36.615 --> 13:40.050
Well, that depends on
how well you want to do.

13:40.051 --> 13:43.086
Ten bucks for an a,
five bucks for a b,

13:43.087 --> 13:45.289
And $2 for handling.

13:45.290 --> 13:47.224
What's "handling"
supposed to mean?

13:47.225 --> 13:50.394
Well, after I finish it,
I have to hand it to you.

13:51.897 --> 13:55.800
Well, let's see what marie
made us for dinner tonight.

14:00.038 --> 14:02.540
Could it be lamb stew?

14:05.009 --> 14:09.780
Honey, would you be offended
if I asked marie
to move in with us?

14:09.781 --> 14:11.782
No. Not at all.

14:11.783 --> 14:15.252
She can move in
as soon as you move out.

14:15.253 --> 14:18.121
You wanna taste what we're
having for dinner tonight?

14:18.122 --> 14:20.491
I'm not that hungry.
Marie made it.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.860
I'm starving.

14:24.095 --> 14:26.096
You know, as soon
as these finals are over,

14:26.097 --> 14:28.131
I'm gonna be back there
behind that stove.

14:28.132 --> 14:31.735
Don't say that,
not even joking.

14:33.371 --> 14:35.639
What are you doing home?
I thought you had band.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.076
Yeah, well, I forgot
my sax. I gotta go back.
Wait, wait, wait.

14:39.077 --> 14:42.847
Did the teacher grade that paper
on the franco-prussian war?

14:42.848 --> 14:44.081
Yeah.

14:44.082 --> 14:46.316
Let me see it.

14:46.317 --> 14:49.453
It's the red folder.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.626
Brad, you got an a!

14:55.627 --> 14:57.895
All right!

15:01.432 --> 15:03.100
What are you
so happy about?

15:03.101 --> 15:06.604
Can't a guy be happy
for his brother?

15:11.877 --> 15:15.112
I-I gotta go.
Well, don't you
need a ride?

15:15.113 --> 15:17.548
No. Eddie's mom's
gonna take me.

15:17.549 --> 15:19.683
Ok, see you later.
Ok. Bye.

15:19.684 --> 15:21.151
Bye.

15:21.152 --> 15:24.021
This is great.
He's handling this
all very well.

15:24.022 --> 15:25.890
He's doing his job real good,
getting an a

15:25.891 --> 15:29.627
On that
franco-american-spaghettio
thing.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.762
Wait a minute.
Listen to this.

15:31.763 --> 15:34.064
"does war bring out
the worst in men,

15:34.065 --> 15:36.333
Or is it the worst in men
that brings on war?"

15:36.334 --> 15:39.403
Oh, oh, oh.

15:39.404 --> 15:42.472
That's good.
No wonder he got an a.

15:42.473 --> 15:45.275
That is the exact same
opening sentence

15:45.276 --> 15:47.511
That randy used on his paper
about the civil war.

15:47.512 --> 15:50.414
What are you suggesting?

15:50.415 --> 15:53.150
Brad wrote randy's paper.

15:59.958 --> 16:04.762
Close, but completely wrong.
Randy wrote this paper.

16:04.763 --> 16:06.730
Why would randy write
a paper for brad?

16:06.731 --> 16:08.933
Well, I don't know.
Hey, wait. Mark.

16:08.934 --> 16:11.401
What are you doing
emptying brad's trash can?

16:11.402 --> 16:14.972
Um... It used to be mine.

16:14.973 --> 16:16.907
Oh, I see.
So you missed it

16:16.908 --> 16:19.076
And you're just emptying it
for old times' sake?

16:19.077 --> 16:20.544
Exactly.
Yeah, right.

16:20.545 --> 16:22.880
Get your can back down
over here.

16:25.516 --> 16:27.150
I didn't do anything.

16:27.151 --> 16:30.153
Are you cleaning
brad's room?
Brad's room?

16:30.154 --> 16:32.056
Mark, you're in a difficult
position.

16:32.057 --> 16:34.892
On one hand, you want
to be loyal to brad.

16:34.893 --> 16:38.428
On the other hand,
we pay your allowance.

16:38.429 --> 16:39.830
My allowance?

16:39.831 --> 16:41.865
And you're repeating
everything we say.

16:41.866 --> 16:43.701
And don't repeat that.

16:43.702 --> 16:45.703
It can only mean
one thing.
Yeah?

16:45.704 --> 16:48.005
Brad pays them more
than we do.

16:51.076 --> 16:54.444
Mark, come on.
We want to know
what is going on.

16:54.445 --> 16:58.716
Brad couldn't handle the job,
so he paid me to do his chores.

16:58.717 --> 17:00.283
And randy to do his homework?

17:00.284 --> 17:02.385
You didn't hear that from me.

17:02.386 --> 17:05.589
If he's having such a problem,
why didn't he just come to us?

17:05.589 --> 17:08.791
He said he had to show you
that he was up to the challenge,

17:08.792 --> 17:10.160
Like a real man.

17:10.161 --> 17:12.061
Oh, tim.

17:12.063 --> 17:13.763
What?

17:15.634 --> 17:17.601
You're the one that told him
he could do it.

17:17.602 --> 17:20.604
Me?
Yeah. I believe
the exact words were,

17:20.605 --> 17:24.008
"I have my doubts,
but if you say so, tim."

17:27.377 --> 17:30.648
You hold it up like that.
I'll go over by the gazebo.

17:33.852 --> 17:36.020
Can you hear me?

17:36.021 --> 17:39.456
Loud and clear,
audio neighbor.

17:39.457 --> 17:41.725
This is great.
Two guys talking
over a distance.

17:41.726 --> 17:43.827
Somebody should've
invented this years ago, huh?

17:43.828 --> 17:47.798
Well, I believe they did, tim.
It's called the telephone.

17:51.235 --> 17:54.237
I could have used this
to snoop on brad.

17:54.238 --> 17:58.042
I would have realized randy
was doing his homework and
mark was acting like his maid.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.044
Well, how did that come about?

18:00.045 --> 18:02.980
He hired his brothers because
he couldn't do the paper route

18:02.981 --> 18:05.515
And schoolwork at the same time.
It was too much for him.

18:05.516 --> 18:08.285
If he was having a problem,
I wonder why he didn't just
come and tell me.

18:08.286 --> 18:11.655
It's hard for a boy
to come to his father
and expose his fallibility.

18:11.656 --> 18:15.392
Oh, it's not like
I haven't seen the kid
in the shower before.

18:15.393 --> 18:19.529
No. No, no, no, no, tim.

18:19.530 --> 18:21.699
What I meant was,
did you have any indications

18:21.700 --> 18:23.701
That brad was having
difficulties?

18:23.702 --> 18:26.336
No. He said he was tired,

18:26.337 --> 18:29.406
That it was becoming a lot
of work, he wanted to quit,

18:29.407 --> 18:31.541
But other than that,
the kid...

18:34.079 --> 18:36.080
So obviously
he did come to you.

18:36.081 --> 18:38.515
Maybe you just had trouble
hearing what he had to say.

18:38.516 --> 18:41.318
Truth is, I probably
wouldn't have heard him
no matter what he said.

18:41.319 --> 18:42.652
Why not?

18:42.653 --> 18:45.689
I was so excited
about him having that job.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.691
I just kept pushing him
and pushing him.

18:47.692 --> 18:49.927
You know I just want
my kids to be great.

18:49.928 --> 18:53.831
Tim, it's not unusual
for a father to want
his son to succeed.

18:53.832 --> 18:57.935
You know, I'm reminded
of what wally schirra
the astronaut said:

18:57.936 --> 19:00.971
"you don't raise heroes,
you raise sons.

19:00.972 --> 19:03.907
"but if you treat them as sons,
they'll turn out to be heroes,

19:03.908 --> 19:07.177
Even if it's just
in your own eyes."

19:07.178 --> 19:10.180
I did push him way too hard.
But it wasn't on purpose.

19:10.181 --> 19:13.483
I know it wasn't.
Thanks for lending me
your ear.

19:13.484 --> 19:16.854
Tim! Thanks
for lending me yours.
Oh.

19:26.131 --> 19:28.565
<i>(brad)</i> hey, dad.
Hello, brad.

19:28.566 --> 19:30.600
Are you having dinner
with us tonight?

19:30.601 --> 19:32.669
Yeah. I'll be down
in one second.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.638
I'm just gonna take
my sax up to my room.

19:34.639 --> 19:36.173
I think your room's about done.

19:36.174 --> 19:39.943
Last I saw, mark was putting
a mint on your pillow.

19:46.918 --> 19:50.220
So I guess you noticed
mark was cleaning my room.

19:50.221 --> 19:53.056
Yes, I noticed that.
Hey, I gotta admit,

19:53.057 --> 19:57.194
I was pretty surprised
when he actually volunteered
to do it.

19:57.195 --> 19:58.796
You must have been
downright amazed

19:58.797 --> 20:02.299
When randy volunteered
to do your homework.

20:02.300 --> 20:06.170
I'm really sorry, dad.
I know I got myself in deep.

20:06.171 --> 20:08.172
And I didn't even know
how to get out of it.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.706
It's all right,
it's all right.

20:09.707 --> 20:12.642
A lot of it's my fault.
I was pushing you to do this.

20:12.643 --> 20:15.345
I didn't listen
when you were telling me
that you didn't want to.

20:15.346 --> 20:18.115
I really wanted to show you
that I could handle it.

20:18.116 --> 20:22.920
I'm reminded of what
the great astronaut,
wally cleaver, said...

20:26.524 --> 20:28.725
"you can't expect
your son to do his homework

20:28.726 --> 20:32.362
And eat a foot-long hero
without prussian dressing."

20:35.766 --> 20:38.101
What?

20:38.102 --> 20:42.372
You're one terrific kid
and I'm real proud of you
for trying this,

20:42.373 --> 20:45.375
But the rest of this week,
concentrate on your homework.

20:45.376 --> 20:49.346
I'll take your two employees,
and we'll finish out the week
so you get a full paycheck.

20:49.347 --> 20:51.348
Oh, thanks, dad.

20:51.349 --> 20:53.851
You know, son, the reason
I was doing this,
I got so into this,

20:53.852 --> 20:57.020
Was because
when I had a paper route,
it was really important to me.

20:57.021 --> 20:58.222
How come?

20:58.223 --> 21:00.357
It was the first job I had
after my dad died,

21:00.358 --> 21:03.460
And I had the job
to show my mom I could
shoulder some responsibility

21:03.461 --> 21:06.730
And not be a goof-off
like my brothers.

21:06.731 --> 21:09.900
I'm sure you didn't quit
your first paper route.
No, I didn't.

21:09.901 --> 21:12.336
See?
I was fired.

21:14.538 --> 21:16.173
Why were you fired?

21:16.174 --> 21:19.442
I was trying to make it fun
and expedite it
at the same time,

21:19.443 --> 21:22.312
So I got a compressed-air gun
that would shoot the papers.

21:23.681 --> 21:26.416
I never got the telemetry down,
which is the angle of attack.

21:26.417 --> 21:28.485
I'd get some...
It'd go... I'd get 'em...

21:28.486 --> 21:32.455
I never got them
anywhere near the damn porch.

21:32.456 --> 21:36.559
I would have made a lot more
money if I knew how to repair
a window back then.

21:40.798 --> 21:43.400
<i>(tim)</i> these are our
collections. 20...

21:43.401 --> 21:47.404
<i>(both)</i> 40, 50, 55, 60.

21:47.405 --> 21:49.606
I'm supposed to have 75.

21:49.607 --> 21:52.609
You were docked
for the windows you broke.

21:52.610 --> 21:55.112
I didn't break any windows.

21:55.113 --> 21:57.981
Technically,
it was your bike,

21:57.982 --> 22:00.550
Your route, done by somebody
with your last name...

22:00.551 --> 22:03.387
Dad!

22:03.388 --> 22:06.256
I'm good for the 15 bucks.
You also ran over a cat's tail

22:06.257 --> 22:08.992
And you were slapped silly
by some old woman.

22:14.665 --> 22:16.699
Good news!

22:16.700 --> 22:18.568
Finals are over.

22:18.569 --> 22:21.104
How'd you do?
I kicked butt.

22:21.105 --> 22:23.106
All right, mom.
Thanks.

22:23.107 --> 22:26.776
Does this mean marie's
not gonna be cooking
for us anymore?

22:26.777 --> 22:28.778
Yes, it does.

22:28.779 --> 22:33.450
I'm gonna be making
a swiss steak in a marinade,

22:33.451 --> 22:38.721
Uh.... Some lovely
scalloped potatoes

22:38.722 --> 22:43.593
And I got a new idea...
To use this squash I found.

22:43.594 --> 22:46.363
You guys hungry?

22:46.364 --> 22:48.565
Guys?
