00:01.062 --> 00:02.029
Previously on The Fosters...

00:02.063 --> 00:03.864
So, how long are you
guys gonna be here for?

00:03.898 --> 00:08.000
I have no idea. It's not really up to me.

00:08.036 --> 00:10.537
You're not jealous, are you?

00:10.571 --> 00:11.755
Of Callie? No.

00:11.789 --> 00:12.906
I don't think this is a good idea.

00:12.940 --> 00:14.741
'Cause of Mariana?

00:14.759 --> 00:15.926
Do you honestly think
that she's gonna care?

00:15.960 --> 00:17.711
I know she is. She told me.

00:17.745 --> 00:20.897
So that's it? We're just gonna
do whatever mariana wants?

00:20.932 --> 00:24.718
I want everyone to write
about guilt in their journals.

00:24.752 --> 00:26.720
Don't worry. No one's gonna read it.

00:26.754 --> 00:28.622
It's just for you to get in
the habit of writing every day.

00:28.656 --> 00:31.792
- She read my journal!
- No, I didn't!

00:31.826 --> 00:34.461
You wrote about Liam?

00:34.495 --> 00:36.763
I have to write a story, and
I need a name for the bad guy.

00:36.798 --> 00:38.765
How about Liam?

00:50.735 --> 00:52.769
Whoa, leave yourself some
room to breathe, sweetheart.

00:52.804 --> 00:54.938
- Come on, I don't need to breathe.
- Yes, you do.

00:54.973 --> 00:56.607
Do you think the top is too...

00:56.641 --> 00:57.040
- Busty?
- Boring?

00:57.075 --> 00:58.709
Right?

00:58.743 --> 01:00.644
- You should jewel it.
- Ah, si.

01:00.678 --> 01:02.813
- Uh, does that cost more?
- Un poco.

01:02.847 --> 01:05.849
- Un poco.
- Por favor, mama?

01:05.884 --> 01:08.719
Gosh, ok.

01:09.821 --> 01:12.723
__

01:17.896 --> 01:19.563
Como?

01:19.597 --> 01:22.499
She's asking if your
father's tie is going to match

01:22.533 --> 01:24.501
with your dress for the
father-daughter dance.

01:24.535 --> 01:26.703
__

01:26.738 --> 01:29.740
Ah, que bueno.

01:29.774 --> 01:33.777
Uh, so you can dance with a padrino or...

01:33.811 --> 01:36.713
a close friend de la familia.

01:36.748 --> 01:40.450
She's dancing with her moms. Right?

01:41.452 --> 01:43.487
Oh.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.555
Hey! Sorry, I'm late!

01:45.590 --> 01:47.824
Hi, sweetie.

01:47.859 --> 01:52.629
So, oh my goodness, you
look beautiful, sweetheart!

01:56.601 --> 01:59.603
Did you see her face

01:59.637 --> 02:01.571
when Stef walked up in her uniform?

02:01.606 --> 02:03.373
Hilarious.

02:03.408 --> 02:04.641
I hate when people say "bueno,"

02:04.676 --> 02:06.743
like you need their approval for something.

02:06.778 --> 02:08.512
When you tell people that
you have a mom and dad,

02:08.545 --> 02:10.547
they don't say, "How wonderful."

02:10.580 --> 02:11.834
Who cares?

02:11.835 --> 02:14.085
I wish I had two moms
throwing me a quinceanera.

02:14.552 --> 02:17.587
My parents refuse and we're Latino.

02:17.622 --> 02:20.490
I mean, so are you, but
you know what I mean.

02:20.525 --> 02:22.559
Yeah, totally.

02:22.593 --> 02:24.594
I just want this to be like, the party that

02:24.629 --> 02:28.265
everybody talks about for
the whole rest of high school.

02:28.299 --> 02:29.566
You know what you need...

02:29.600 --> 02:32.369
- Three hundred dollars?
- Shh.

02:32.403 --> 02:35.372
For a dress she's only going to wear once?

02:35.406 --> 02:37.607
We'll cut it short and
she can wear it to prom.

02:37.642 --> 02:39.576
We're spending a fortune on this party.

02:39.610 --> 02:42.312
It's not just a party, and we
already set this money aside.

02:42.347 --> 02:44.414
Yes, before we had two more mouths to feed.

02:44.449 --> 02:47.551
Love, I'm just asking can
we just rein it in, please?

02:47.585 --> 02:51.254
Did you talk to her about
the Kelsey situation?

02:51.289 --> 02:54.291
- Yes, I did.
- And how did that go?

02:54.325 --> 02:57.227
So, Lexi and I were talking...

02:57.261 --> 02:59.463
can we get a bubble machine for the party?

02:59.497 --> 03:01.264
- No.
- Sure.

03:03.501 --> 03:05.469
- Sure.
- Yes.

03:38.469 --> 03:47.378
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:48.446 --> 03:50.180
Make them thinner than that, sweetheart...

03:50.214 --> 03:52.449
I'm just making sure you
have Mariana's playlist...

03:52.483 --> 03:56.319
- Good job, buddy.
- ... nothing too provocative or
with any explicit lyrics.

03:56.354 --> 04:00.290
- What's for dinner?
- Not chips, my friend.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.261
Hey, can Talya stay for dinner?

04:04.295 --> 04:06.430
- Ooh, Lexi, too?
- Sure.

04:09.300 --> 04:11.468
Hey Callie, how was your day?

04:11.502 --> 04:14.404
Uh, it was good.

04:14.439 --> 04:19.509
Uh, so Callie, you know my friend Kelsey?

04:19.543 --> 04:23.480
Oh, the one who lied and
said I sold her drugs?

04:23.514 --> 04:27.250
- Yeah, well she's in rehab.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

04:28.453 --> 04:31.288
So, do you want to take
her place in my court?

04:31.322 --> 04:34.458
I think that is a great idea, Mariana.

04:34.492 --> 04:38.328
Um, what do you think, Callie?

04:38.362 --> 04:44.134
- Uh, sure, I guess.
- Great.

04:44.168 --> 04:46.336
We'll just have to hurry and get
your gown fitted before Saturday.

04:46.370 --> 04:50.140
I have to wear a gown?

04:50.174 --> 04:53.310
Well, you don't have to do anything.

04:53.344 --> 04:56.279
- And we get to do a waltz.
- It's gonna be fun.

04:56.314 --> 04:58.381
- Like eating glass.
- Hey, shut it.

04:58.416 --> 05:01.251
So, who does Callie get to dance with?

05:01.285 --> 05:03.186
Brandon.

05:04.422 --> 05:08.391
Yeah, I mean, but... you're my date.

05:08.426 --> 05:12.028
Well, duh.

05:19.103 --> 05:22.205
- Hey, B? Hey.
- Yeah?

05:22.273 --> 05:25.408
Everything ok with you and Talya?

05:25.443 --> 05:30.013
- Yeah, why wouldn't it be?
- I don't know, just...

05:31.482 --> 05:33.250
Brandon, listen.

05:33.284 --> 05:36.153
You know that, I'm assuming
that you know that...

05:36.187 --> 05:42.025
well, you know, foster
siblings are not allowed to...

05:42.059 --> 05:45.061
Hook up? I don't know what
you guys call it these days?

05:45.096 --> 05:46.463
There's nothing going
on between Callie and I.

05:46.497 --> 05:49.499
- Callie and me.
- Yeah, ok.

05:49.534 --> 05:52.502
It's just, when the twins
got here you were nine.

05:52.537 --> 05:54.371
- Right, and now I'm a horny teenager.
- Yes.

05:54.405 --> 05:56.206
Hm.

05:56.240 --> 05:59.009
Mom, I have a girlfriend
and I know the rules.

05:59.043 --> 06:01.044
- Ok.
- Ok.

06:02.386 --> 06:06.089
Will you do me a favor and
take these to your brother?

06:06.123 --> 06:10.327
Tell him to please stop leaving
his crap around the house.

06:10.361 --> 06:13.029
- Crap is not a bad word.
- It's not a nice word.

06:13.064 --> 06:15.232
Well, give me a word to say then.

06:19.036 --> 06:21.004
How's your mom?

06:21.038 --> 06:22.372
- She's fine.
- Yeah?

06:22.406 --> 06:25.008
She's taking a shuttle
from the airport tomorrow.

06:25.042 --> 06:27.043
Well, that's good. That'll help us, right?

06:27.078 --> 06:29.012
Yeah, what would help us is
if she wasn't coming at all.

06:29.046 --> 06:30.914
Oh, my gosh.

06:30.948 --> 06:33.950
I'll never understand why
Dana stresses you out so much.

06:33.985 --> 06:35.986
She's nothing but lovely to me.

06:36.020 --> 06:37.153
You're not her daughter.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.256
Speaking of daughters,

06:39.290 --> 06:43.126
I think ours might be
feeling a little embarrassed.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.828
About what?

06:44.862 --> 06:47.964
About dancing with us at her party.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.833
Did she say something to you?

06:49.867 --> 06:54.804
- No.
- Well, stop projecting.

06:54.839 --> 06:57.974
Mariana's always been
very proud of us, really.

06:58.009 --> 07:00.176
She's fine.

07:03.914 --> 07:07.784
Should I have Mariachi? That's traditional.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.053
So is having a Catholic mass
and you're not doing that.

07:10.087 --> 07:11.921
Yeah, true.

07:13.724 --> 07:15.759
What about the shoe ceremony?

07:15.793 --> 07:17.127
- Uh-uh. No.
- A doll thing?

07:18.162 --> 07:20.930
My mom's going to be here any minute.

07:20.965 --> 07:22.766
I'm going to go use the ladies' room.

07:23.968 --> 07:25.869
The ladies' room?

07:31.075 --> 07:35.712
Hey, so I know your moms

07:35.746 --> 07:37.981
made you ask me to be in your party.

07:38.015 --> 07:40.984
So, I can tell them I don't want to do it.

07:41.018 --> 07:43.887
I don't know. Whatever.
If you don't want to.

07:43.921 --> 07:45.822
No, it's not that I don't want to.

07:45.856 --> 07:47.557
It's if you don't want me to.

07:47.591 --> 07:49.693
I don't mind.

07:49.727 --> 07:53.630
- You know, you don't have to.
- No, I know I don't have to.

07:53.664 --> 07:56.833
Ok, well, it's up to you.

07:56.867 --> 08:02.505
Ok. Well, then yeah. But
I don't know how to waltz.

08:02.540 --> 08:03.840
Well, neither do I.

08:03.874 --> 08:05.575
A friend of our moms is teaching us.

08:05.609 --> 08:08.478
Cool.

08:10.748 --> 08:11.881
Cool.

08:18.556 --> 08:19.889
- I'm in here.
- Hey!

08:19.924 --> 08:21.758
- You didn't lock the door?
- I'm sorry.

08:21.792 --> 08:23.626
I hate sneaking around like this.

08:23.661 --> 08:26.429
- But, it's kind of hot.
- I mean it.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.398
Fine, let's tell her now.

08:28.432 --> 08:29.733
Not before her party.

08:35.405 --> 08:36.539
After.

08:36.573 --> 08:38.607
I shouldn't even be doing this.

08:38.642 --> 08:40.477
- Yes, you should.
- I have to go home.

08:40.510 --> 08:42.544
- I have to go home.
- No, you do not.

08:42.580 --> 08:45.815
Go. Go before Mariana thinks I fell in.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.601
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:04.635 --> 09:06.503
I just wanted to say goodnight to you guys.

09:06.537 --> 09:09.672
And Jude, thank you so much for helping
out with dinner, you did a great job.

09:09.707 --> 09:11.341
Thanks.

09:11.375 --> 09:15.478
- Night, Mom.
- Hey you, Jesus Foster.

09:15.513 --> 09:20.350
You're being a real sport
about Mariana's party, eh?

09:20.384 --> 09:22.442
You're a good brother. It's ok.

09:22.445 --> 09:25.255
Just as long as I'm the one who
gets the car when we turn 16.

09:25.289 --> 09:28.591
- Yeah, that's gonna happen.
- Yeah, what he said.

09:28.626 --> 09:31.294
All right, goodnight you guys.

09:31.328 --> 09:34.164
- Thanks for dinner.
- Yeah, of course.

09:38.602 --> 09:42.205
- What?
- Nothing.

09:47.278 --> 09:50.146
- Hey, where's Callie?
- Bathroom.

09:50.181 --> 09:53.183
Oh, those look fantastic,
sweetheart. Good job.

09:53.217 --> 09:55.385
All right, goodnight, lovely.

09:55.419 --> 09:57.487
Mm. Don't stay up late, ok?

09:57.521 --> 10:00.290
- Ok, goodnight, Mom.
- Oh...

10:00.324 --> 10:03.193
Hey, listen, you know,
Mama said something to me,

10:03.227 --> 10:05.028
and I just wanted to check in with you.

10:05.062 --> 10:08.298
You're not embarrassed to dance
with us at your party, are you?

10:38.626 --> 10:42.796
That's a sad lunch, but I
guess it beats prison food.

10:42.830 --> 10:45.065
Really? That's your opening line?

10:45.099 --> 10:47.935
I was going to ask about your rap sheet,

10:47.969 --> 10:50.003
but I thought that was rude.

10:51.906 --> 10:53.874
That's where you're supposed to laugh,

10:53.908 --> 10:56.910
and you realize that we're
both outsiders who nobody gets.

10:56.945 --> 10:59.947
And then you get my name
tattooed on your neck,

10:59.981 --> 11:02.616
until it all goes terribly wrong,

11:02.650 --> 11:04.918
and you have to turn it into a snake

11:04.953 --> 11:09.690
just biting your earlobe.

11:09.724 --> 11:11.758
What do you want from me?

11:11.793 --> 11:14.494
What every guy wants.

11:14.529 --> 11:17.664
Stimulating conversation.

11:17.699 --> 11:21.702
And sex. That's probably
off the table, huh?

11:24.505 --> 11:25.806
Look at that smile.

11:28.610 --> 11:31.845
So, listen, some of us are
hanging out at the beach

11:31.879 --> 11:34.481
by the pier, Saturday
night, you should come.

11:34.549 --> 11:39.353
- I can't, I have a thing.
- What kind of thing.

11:39.387 --> 11:41.688
The kind that you'd make
fun of if I told you.

11:43.625 --> 11:46.493
When your thing gets boring...

11:46.527 --> 11:48.395
you know where to find me.

11:55.670 --> 12:00.307
Don't be shy. Place your right
hand on your partner's waist.

12:02.277 --> 12:05.245
And slightly around to
the small of her back.

12:08.616 --> 12:11.285
Extend the left hand.

12:11.319 --> 12:12.653
Palm raised.

12:12.687 --> 12:15.522
Callie, rest your hand gently in his.

12:15.556 --> 12:19.559
Other hand, up on his shoulder like so.

12:19.594 --> 12:21.261
A little closer.

12:23.398 --> 12:24.564
Good, hold that position.

12:24.599 --> 12:28.468
In partner dancing, connection is key.

12:28.503 --> 12:33.140
So, Brandon and Callie,
look into each others eyes.

12:35.176 --> 12:36.376
Breathe.

12:36.411 --> 12:40.147
Connect. And you two.

12:41.482 --> 12:45.152
And over here. Right hand, on her waist.

12:45.219 --> 12:47.454
Left hand...

12:50.224 --> 12:53.493
Everyone? Gram's here!

12:55.096 --> 12:58.165
- Dana, you made it.
- Of course I made it.

12:58.199 --> 13:01.134
- Good to see you.
- Oh, hello beautiful.

13:01.169 --> 13:03.236
- Hi Mom.
- Oh, your skin looks good.

13:03.271 --> 13:05.726
You've been moisturizing,
but my God, you're pale.

13:05.727 --> 13:07.052
Baby, you need some sun.

13:07.128 --> 13:08.962
Yeah, but she's gorgeous. Look at her.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.364
Of course, she's gorgeous.

13:10.398 --> 13:14.334
- Gram!
- And there's my beautiful birthday girl.

13:14.369 --> 13:18.038
Oh, and my handsome birthday boy!

13:18.072 --> 13:20.107
Your grandfather's very
sorry he couldn't be here,

13:20.141 --> 13:21.975
but he got stuck in Paris at a conference.

13:22.010 --> 13:24.011
I wish I was stuck in Paris.

13:24.045 --> 13:27.848
You play your cards right
and I will take you one day.

13:27.882 --> 13:29.850
Where's my other dashing grandson?

13:29.884 --> 13:31.985
Uh, practice.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.122
Well...

13:35.156 --> 13:39.126
you must be Callie.

13:39.160 --> 13:42.162
- And you must be Jude.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.198
- It's lovely to meet you both.
- Thanks.

13:45.233 --> 13:47.301
Everyone in this house calls me Gram.

13:47.335 --> 13:51.938
Guess what, I've got fabulous presents...

13:59.781 --> 14:02.749
Gotta be out the door in 15!

14:04.118 --> 14:07.054
- Wow.
- Wow yourself.

14:07.088 --> 14:09.122
Mm, we should dress up
for each other more often.

14:09.157 --> 14:11.892
- I know.
- Or you could check your email.

14:11.926 --> 14:13.894
Oh, I'm sorry...

14:13.928 --> 14:16.063
Everything's done, sweetheart. Let it go.

14:16.097 --> 14:17.731
I just want her party to be perfect.

14:17.765 --> 14:18.899
She's going to be the center of attention.

14:18.933 --> 14:20.867
For Mariana, it don't
get no better than that.

14:20.902 --> 14:24.104
Ok, you guys need another bathroom.

14:24.138 --> 14:26.707
- You look lovely, Dana.
- You really do, Mom.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.809
Thank you. It's a miracle
because no black woman

14:28.843 --> 14:30.811
can tame the mane in 15 minutes.

14:30.845 --> 14:32.679
Luckily, you don't have that problem.

14:32.714 --> 14:34.815
Yeah, I don't exactly
just wake up like this.

14:34.849 --> 14:38.051
- Baby, that is a compliment.
- Ok, gift bags. Enough.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.786
It's good... it's good like that.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.856
Well, my you look handsome.

14:42.890 --> 14:45.759
Well, you too... pretty, I mean.

14:45.793 --> 14:47.661
Oh, right, I think.

14:47.695 --> 14:49.029
Help me with the gift bags.
Bring 'em out to the car.

14:49.063 --> 14:50.797
Thanks.

15:02.577 --> 15:05.579
- Uh, you need help?
- What?

15:06.714 --> 15:10.550
Oh, uh... no. I got it.

15:12.687 --> 15:14.488
You look... nice.

15:19.827 --> 15:21.628
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:21.662 --> 15:22.863
Look at you, hottie.

15:26.501 --> 15:27.601
Um...

15:27.635 --> 15:31.872
Well, I should take these to the car.

15:35.910 --> 15:39.413
- You look pretty.
- You, too.

15:39.447 --> 15:42.516
It really is nice for Mariana
to ask you to be in her court.

15:42.550 --> 15:45.552
Seeing as how, you know,
this is a temporary situation.

15:45.620 --> 15:50.557
Well, you never know. I mean,
they might decide to keep us.

15:50.591 --> 15:52.459
Maybe.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.628
- I mean, unless...
- What?

15:54.662 --> 15:56.463
- They knew something.
- Something?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.732
Like what happened with Liam.

16:00.601 --> 16:02.702
You make it a habit of reading
other people's journals?

16:02.737 --> 16:05.272
Just people I don't trust.

16:06.441 --> 16:08.608
Going to go help Brandon.

16:08.643 --> 16:10.577
What's going on?

16:30.381 --> 16:33.450
Hey. You look nice.

16:33.484 --> 16:36.419
Oh, thank you. So do you.

16:36.454 --> 16:38.488
That Lena's one lucky lady, huh?

16:38.523 --> 16:41.424
- Ok.
- So, listen...

16:41.459 --> 16:45.395
- I wanted to give you this.
- Child support? That's great.

16:45.429 --> 16:46.730
It's for Mariana. It's for the party.

16:46.764 --> 16:51.368
Look, I know this is costing you
guys a fortune and I asked around.

16:51.402 --> 16:53.537
It's tradition for friends and
family to help out with these things.

16:53.571 --> 16:57.641
It's very sweet, Mike. I really do
appreciate it, but we can't accept this.

16:57.675 --> 16:59.509
I'm not taking that.

16:59.544 --> 17:02.345
If you don't take it, I'm
going to be deeply offended.

17:02.380 --> 17:06.249
And you, of all people, should know
you don't want me deeply offended.

17:06.284 --> 17:08.417
- Well, thank you very much.
- Ok.

17:10.421 --> 17:12.489
Actually, Mike, there is
something that you could do for me.

17:12.522 --> 17:15.625
Um, I know it's last minute,
but Mariana has actually asked

17:15.660 --> 17:18.627
if you would do the
father-daughter dance with her.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.530
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:20.565 --> 17:22.598
- Seriously, me?
- Yeah.

17:22.633 --> 17:26.203
Wow. Yeah, of course. I'd be honored.

17:26.237 --> 17:28.538
- Ok.
- I mean, you ok with that?

17:28.573 --> 17:31.141
Yeah, well, apparently
dancing with your two moms

17:31.175 --> 17:33.410
is not exactly quince tradition, so...

17:33.444 --> 17:36.246
just roll with the punches.

17:36.280 --> 17:38.415
- What about Lena?
- Oh no, it's fine, really.

17:38.449 --> 17:41.518
We want her to have the party she
wants and this is what she wants.

17:41.552 --> 17:45.522
Ok, well, she's lucky to have you two.

17:45.556 --> 17:48.225
- You're great moms.
- That hurt to say, didn't it.

17:48.259 --> 17:51.428
No, not at all. Hey, look
at you in your penguin suit.

17:51.462 --> 17:53.463
- Huh?
- Never mind.

17:53.497 --> 17:56.132
If I'm going to cut a rug with Mariana,

17:56.167 --> 17:57.968
I'm going to need a little liquid courage.

17:58.002 --> 17:59.970
Ok.

18:00.004 --> 18:02.305
Wait, Mariana is dancing with Mike?

18:02.340 --> 18:04.307
I thought she was dancing with you two.

18:04.342 --> 18:07.344
It's fine, Jesus. Will you please
finish up this table for me?

18:07.378 --> 18:09.946
Thanks, love.

18:10.014 --> 18:11.214
Ok.

18:15.319 --> 18:19.189
You look like a princess.

18:19.223 --> 18:20.957
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

18:20.992 --> 18:23.059
What if it's no fun? What if
I trip and fall on my face?

18:23.094 --> 18:25.262
You won't, and it's going to be amazing.

18:29.100 --> 18:32.002
- What is that?
- Your birthday present.

18:32.036 --> 18:33.236
I wanted you to open it first.

18:33.304 --> 18:35.071
Help me open it.

18:40.044 --> 18:42.045
Oh, my God. Did you do this all yourself?

18:44.148 --> 18:46.283
- Where did you get this picture?
- Your moms.

18:46.317 --> 18:49.185
- I loved that dress!
- She was new to our school

18:49.220 --> 18:52.822
and she wore this princess
dress every day for like a month.

18:52.857 --> 18:54.024
I was obsessed with Belle.

18:54.058 --> 18:56.993
And one day she fell on the
playground and ripped it.

18:57.028 --> 18:58.895
And I burst into tears.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.031
Never mind the fact that
her knee was all bloody.

19:01.065 --> 19:04.701
It was humiliating. Everybody
laughed at me, except for Lexi.

19:04.735 --> 19:06.836
She helped me up and took
me to the nurse's office.

19:06.871 --> 19:08.805
You were my first friend.

19:08.839 --> 19:10.740
And best friend.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.777
Thank you. I love you.

19:15.146 --> 19:16.980
I love you.

19:19.850 --> 19:22.819
Can I interrupt?

19:26.090 --> 19:28.758
I'm going to go get everybody together.

19:28.793 --> 19:30.694
I'll see you out there.

19:30.728 --> 19:32.729
Me, too.

19:32.763 --> 19:34.798
Honey, you look beautiful.

19:34.832 --> 19:36.800
Thank you.

19:36.834 --> 19:38.802
So, what's in the box?

19:38.836 --> 19:40.737
Open it and see.

19:48.045 --> 19:50.814
Oh, my God, it's gorgeous.

19:50.848 --> 19:53.883
Every girl wears a tiara on her quinces.

19:53.918 --> 19:56.686
Oh God, it looks so expensive.

19:56.721 --> 19:58.521
It was, don't tell Mom.

20:00.758 --> 20:02.525
Thank you.

20:02.560 --> 20:05.528
Beautiful, beautiful.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.598
- She's my best friend.
- So?

20:08.632 --> 20:11.768
So, I'm not thinking about her
feelings, I'm being selfish.

20:11.802 --> 20:12.936
What are you talking about right now?

20:12.970 --> 20:15.905
You're not being selfish.
Mariana's the selfish one.

20:15.940 --> 20:17.974
My mom's just spending a bunch
of money on this stupid party,

20:18.009 --> 20:19.776
she's not even dancing with them.

20:19.810 --> 20:22.912
You know what else? She's still
in contact with our birth mom.

20:22.947 --> 20:24.893
After I saved her ass.

20:26.215 --> 20:27.738
We're not ending this.

20:27.818 --> 20:30.553
- Don't do this.
- I'm sorry.

20:49.220 --> 20:51.422
Hi honey, did you find Lexi?

20:51.456 --> 20:53.424
- No.
- You ok?

20:53.458 --> 20:55.259
I'm fine.

20:56.294 --> 20:58.128
- Hey, have you seen Lexi?
- No.

20:58.163 --> 21:01.131
Sorry, I was in the bathroom.

21:01.166 --> 21:03.934
You're going to the bathroom a lot lately.

21:03.968 --> 21:06.170
Maybe you have a bladder infection.

21:06.204 --> 21:07.371
Mariana?

21:09.274 --> 21:11.108
Here sweetie, on your left wrist.

21:11.142 --> 21:12.309
Ok, everybody, couple up.

21:12.343 --> 21:14.144
The DJ's going to announce the court,

21:14.179 --> 21:16.313
and then Mariana and Jesus,
you'll make your grand entrance.

21:16.347 --> 21:18.382
You all look wonderful,
beautiful, handsome.

21:18.416 --> 21:20.050
Good luck. Come on, Talya.

21:20.084 --> 21:21.985
- Ready?
- All right.

21:27.292 --> 21:29.927
- What are you doing?
- I think we should switch.

21:29.961 --> 21:32.296
Sam's too tall for Lexi.

21:35.967 --> 21:37.367
Works for me.

21:50.114 --> 21:54.218
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to Mariana's quinceanera!

21:54.252 --> 21:56.887
Now, can I have everyone please rise

21:56.921 --> 22:00.023
and give a warm welcome
as you receive her court.

22:00.058 --> 22:02.993
Starting with Lexi Rivera and Sam Wilkins.

22:15.106 --> 22:19.009
Let's keep it going with
Callie Jacob and Brandon Foster!

22:36.160 --> 22:39.129
Relax, this is your big moment.

22:39.163 --> 22:42.199
And now, the moment we've
all been waiting for,

22:42.233 --> 22:44.101
ladies and gentlemen,

22:44.135 --> 22:47.971
Mariana Foster and her
brother Jesus Foster.

23:02.153 --> 23:04.154
But first we'd like to
kick things off with the

23:04.188 --> 23:07.057
traditional padrino dance.

23:07.091 --> 23:10.227
Please welcome family friend, Mike Foster.

23:25.410 --> 23:29.179
- Is Mariana ok?
- She's fine.

23:29.213 --> 23:32.916
Hey, what was that
about? Did I do something?

23:32.951 --> 23:34.318
You need to tell your girlfriend to chill.

23:34.352 --> 23:36.219
Why, what she'd do?

23:36.254 --> 23:40.357
She thinks I have a thing for you.

23:40.391 --> 23:42.359
What... she said that?

23:42.393 --> 23:45.362
Can you just tell her that
she has nothing to worry about?

23:45.396 --> 23:49.266
Please?

24:10.321 --> 24:12.289
Very nice.

24:12.323 --> 24:14.124
At this time, we'd like to welcome

24:14.158 --> 24:15.926
Mariana's court to the dance floor for

24:15.960 --> 24:18.261
the traditional Viennese Waltz.

24:23.301 --> 24:27.004
All right, you're dancing with me. Come on.

24:51.262 --> 24:53.196
- I know.
- Know what?

24:53.231 --> 24:54.965
About you and Lexi.

24:56.234 --> 24:57.234
Dance.

24:59.237 --> 25:01.171
We didn't want to tell you.

25:01.205 --> 25:03.874
We didn't want to ruin your party.

25:04.909 --> 25:06.276
Well, you did.

25:08.212 --> 25:11.214
Ok, forget what I said
about Talya. I'm sorry.

25:11.249 --> 25:13.183
You have nothing to be sorry about.

25:15.853 --> 25:17.220
I don't get why it's such a big deal.

25:17.255 --> 25:18.989
This doesn't change anything.

25:19.023 --> 25:21.291
You could have any girl you wanted.

25:21.325 --> 25:24.261
Why'd it have to be my best friend?

26:13.962 --> 26:17.098
Can we have everyone back
to the dance floor, please?

26:20.102 --> 26:23.104
What do you say, Dana? You
want to get your groove on?

26:23.138 --> 26:25.006
- Why not.
- Come on.

26:25.040 --> 26:26.407
Oh, I don't know who should be more scared!

26:26.442 --> 26:29.110
That's right.

26:29.144 --> 26:31.212
- Oh no, do we have to?
- Yes.

26:40.289 --> 26:44.125
- You guys are so great.
- Um, I'm thirsty.

26:55.003 --> 26:57.271
- Mariana.
- I have nothing to say to you.

26:57.306 --> 26:59.040
Mariana, wait.

27:11.220 --> 27:13.087
Brandon.

27:14.289 --> 27:16.891
Brandon? What is going on?

27:16.925 --> 27:19.193
Don't play dumb with me.

27:19.228 --> 27:21.262
Callie told me what you did.

27:21.296 --> 27:23.965
Ok, I read her journal because...

27:23.999 --> 27:25.133
Wait, wait. You read her journal?

27:25.167 --> 27:28.136
- Yes, and I'm glad I did...
- I can't believe you.

27:28.170 --> 27:31.305
No. Shut up! I can't do this anymore!

27:31.340 --> 27:33.307
- I'm done.
- Please...

27:33.342 --> 27:35.143
Fine, but ask her.

27:36.345 --> 27:38.946
Ask her about Liam.

27:44.119 --> 27:46.087
Mariana.

27:48.090 --> 27:50.992
- Can we talk?
- Talk about what?

27:51.026 --> 27:52.994
How my best friend and brother lied to me?

27:53.028 --> 27:56.097
We didn't lie to you,
we just didn't tell you.

27:56.131 --> 27:58.232
Same thing.

27:58.267 --> 28:01.002
And you know what hurts the most?

28:01.036 --> 28:04.272
Hearing all the awful things
that Jesus said about me.

28:04.306 --> 28:07.208
And you didn't even defend me.

28:07.242 --> 28:10.311
That's not what a best friend does.

28:17.920 --> 28:19.320
Yeah, I'll have another double. Neat.

28:19.354 --> 28:21.022
You got it.

28:22.991 --> 28:24.892
Hey, two white wines, please.

28:27.129 --> 28:29.096
Hope you're pacing yourself, Mike.

28:29.131 --> 28:32.066
It's a party, Stef. Have some fun.

28:37.973 --> 28:40.041
This is a lovely party.

28:40.075 --> 28:41.275
Thanks.

28:42.911 --> 28:44.879
I know money's been
tough for you and Stef...

28:44.913 --> 28:47.114
- Mom, we're fine.
- I know you're fine,

28:47.149 --> 28:50.251
but with two more mouths to feed,

28:50.285 --> 28:52.286
this is a lot to spend on a birthday party.

28:52.321 --> 28:54.889
Well, it's not just a birthday party.

28:54.923 --> 28:57.959
This is about Mariana
embracing her cultural heritage.

28:57.993 --> 29:00.294
About being part of the Latino community.

29:00.329 --> 29:02.230
Which, of course, she isn't.

29:03.298 --> 29:05.933
I'm just saying being that Latina isn't

29:05.968 --> 29:09.003
just about the color of her skin.

29:09.037 --> 29:12.306
- But being black is?
- What?

29:12.341 --> 29:15.309
For you being black has always been about

29:15.344 --> 29:17.011
the color of a person's skin.

29:17.045 --> 29:18.112
- That's not true.
- Yes, it is.

29:18.146 --> 29:20.181
All I've ever said is
that dark skinned people,

29:20.215 --> 29:23.284
have a different experience
than light skinned ones.

29:23.318 --> 29:26.153
And by different, you mean more authentic.

29:26.188 --> 29:28.122
I mean harder.

29:28.156 --> 29:31.859
Honey, dark skinned people
face more discrimination.

29:31.893 --> 29:35.863
That is just a fact of life.

29:35.897 --> 29:40.134
So, maybe we are trying to make up
for what we couldn't give Mariana.

29:40.168 --> 29:42.870
But I understand how she feels.

29:42.904 --> 29:44.939
Do you now?

29:44.973 --> 29:47.241
You were raised by a black mother.

29:47.276 --> 29:48.976
And by a white father.

29:51.079 --> 29:53.414
And I never felt accepted
by either community, Mom.

29:53.448 --> 29:55.283
Well, I'm so sorry if you had such a

29:55.317 --> 29:57.118
tough time being a beautiful
light skinned woman...

29:57.152 --> 30:00.054
- Oh, Mom...
- But like it or not,

30:00.088 --> 30:02.423
the color of your skin
has afforded you more

30:02.457 --> 30:07.028
opportunities than anyone
like me has ever had.

30:07.062 --> 30:08.996
That is what you've always assumed.

30:09.031 --> 30:11.032
That being biracial
has made my life easier.

30:11.066 --> 30:14.201
Because it has.

30:14.236 --> 30:17.271
Like it or not, you will
never know what it is like

30:17.306 --> 30:20.274
to be a black woman in America.

30:33.350 --> 30:36.786
Look at the bright side,
now we can dance together.

30:36.821 --> 30:38.655
I don't really feel like dancing.

30:38.689 --> 30:40.657
I should go home. Mariana
doesn't want me here.

30:40.725 --> 30:43.760
No, I want you here. It's my birthday, too.

30:43.794 --> 30:47.564
- How did she find out?
- I don't know.

30:47.598 --> 30:51.434
But look, she's not
letting it ruin her party.

30:54.505 --> 30:57.240
We shouldn't let it ruin ours.

31:03.547 --> 31:05.582
What's that about?

31:05.616 --> 31:07.584
They have a thing for each other.

31:07.618 --> 31:09.586
How do you know?

31:09.620 --> 31:11.387
I pay attention.

31:11.422 --> 31:13.623
They're not going to keep us, you know.

31:13.657 --> 31:15.592
What are you talking about?

31:15.626 --> 31:17.393
Brandon.

31:17.428 --> 31:19.529
Ok, Jude? I'm not stupid, ok?

31:19.563 --> 31:22.699
But sometimes you do stupid things.

31:22.767 --> 31:25.635
Excuse me. Do you want to dance?

31:28.739 --> 31:30.507
Go.

31:36.714 --> 31:38.681
Hey, I've been looking all over for you.

31:38.716 --> 31:41.351
Is one of those for me?

31:41.385 --> 31:43.453
Is one going to be enough?

31:43.487 --> 31:45.522
There's not enough wine in this world.

31:45.556 --> 31:47.557
This about your mom?

31:47.591 --> 31:49.492
She just told me...

31:49.527 --> 31:51.594
I don't know what it's
like to be a black woman.

31:51.629 --> 31:55.331
She's not right, you know that.

31:58.435 --> 32:00.470
She's right about one thing,

32:00.504 --> 32:03.506
and that's why I wanted to
have this party for Mariana,

32:03.541 --> 32:05.408
and why I don't give a
damn how much it costs,

32:05.442 --> 32:07.443
because I understand what that's like.

32:07.478 --> 32:09.646
Not knowing where you belong.

32:09.680 --> 32:11.681
I felt like that my entire life.

32:11.715 --> 32:13.650
You know where you belong.

32:13.684 --> 32:15.718
I shouldn't be doing this.

32:15.753 --> 32:17.720
- This is Mariana's party.
- Hey, hey, hey...

32:17.755 --> 32:19.489
Listen to me.

32:19.523 --> 32:22.358
This is her party but you
can cry if you want to.

32:31.769 --> 32:33.503
I love you.

32:54.391 --> 32:56.359
Can I have everyone's attention?

32:56.393 --> 32:58.628
Can everyone please find their seat?

32:58.662 --> 33:02.232
And can I have Stef and Lena
join us on the dance floor?

33:04.335 --> 33:07.403
Mariana, your moms have something
they'd like to say to you.

33:13.477 --> 33:18.348
Ok, first of all, Jesus, will
you please come join your sister?

33:24.588 --> 33:28.458
Ok, first we want to thank
all of our friends and family

33:28.492 --> 33:30.460
for coming to join us and celebrating this

33:30.494 --> 33:32.428
very, very special
birthday today. Thank you.

33:35.499 --> 33:39.335
Our babies are 15! Could you believe this?

33:40.571 --> 33:44.340
To our beloved Jesus and Mariana,

33:44.375 --> 33:48.745
you have brought so much
joy and love to your moms,

33:48.779 --> 33:52.348
and to your brother Brandon's life as well.

33:52.383 --> 33:55.418
He begged us and begged us
for a brother or a sister,

33:55.452 --> 33:57.687
and got both in one fell swoop.

33:57.721 --> 34:01.424
Um, we love you so very much,

34:01.458 --> 34:03.660
and since a picture is
worth a thousand words,

34:03.694 --> 34:05.187
I'm going to shut up and
we're going to watch this.

34:05.188 --> 34:06.177
So, go over there.

36:13.190 --> 36:18.428
Ok, and Jesus, just so you don't
think we forgot about you...

36:19.630 --> 36:21.464
Happy birthday!

36:21.498 --> 36:24.167
Not in the house, young man.

36:24.201 --> 36:25.334
Thank you so much.

36:28.205 --> 36:31.507
Now, may I please have the rest of
the family up here for a photo, please?

36:31.542 --> 36:33.376
Come on.

36:33.410 --> 36:35.478
Come on, Callie and Jude.

36:35.512 --> 36:37.447
Callie, come on.

36:40.350 --> 36:42.185
- All right, Fosters.
- Come on.

36:42.219 --> 36:44.420
Everyone together now.

36:45.656 --> 36:47.423
Closer...

36:47.458 --> 36:49.192
All right.

36:49.226 --> 36:50.593
Scooch in. Everyone scooch in.

36:50.627 --> 36:53.129
- One, two, three.
- Look at that.

36:53.163 --> 36:56.232
Smile!

37:07.411 --> 37:11.147
Honey, it's a beautiful party.

37:20.591 --> 37:22.258
Yay!

37:30.467 --> 37:32.535
- What happened to Talya?
- She left.

37:32.569 --> 37:36.339
- Are you ok?
- Nope.

38:07.304 --> 38:09.138
I broke up with Talya.

38:09.173 --> 38:11.140
- Because of me.
- No, no, I...

38:11.175 --> 38:14.310
I mean, I'm sure that's what
she thinks, but it's not.

38:14.344 --> 38:17.280
I broke up with her because
she's doing stupid things.

38:17.314 --> 38:20.249
Like reading your journal.

38:22.352 --> 38:26.155
- She told you.
- She didn't tell me what it said.

38:26.190 --> 38:28.157
I didn't want to hear it.

38:30.227 --> 38:34.197
Callie, I already know everything
I need to know about you.

38:41.605 --> 38:44.106
Hey.

38:44.608 --> 38:47.176
Callie? Hey.

38:47.211 --> 38:51.247
Callie? Callie, wait.

38:52.449 --> 38:55.451
Hey! Brandon?

38:55.485 --> 38:59.121
You haven't said boo to
your old man all night.

38:59.156 --> 39:02.158
- Sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

39:02.192 --> 39:04.393
Come here, come here.

39:04.428 --> 39:08.397
I love you.

39:08.432 --> 39:10.199
I love you, too.

39:10.234 --> 39:14.503
I love you so much. Look at you, hm?

39:14.538 --> 39:18.341
You're a man, now. You're all grown up.

39:18.375 --> 39:20.443
I wish...

39:20.477 --> 39:22.411
What?

39:22.446 --> 39:25.248
I wish I could do it all over again.

39:28.285 --> 39:30.286
Dad.

39:32.389 --> 39:35.324
Ok, I know it's a party, so go have fun.

39:35.359 --> 39:36.492
I'm going to go home.

39:36.526 --> 39:39.362
Ah, I think I should drive you home.

39:39.396 --> 39:42.131
I think you're right.

39:42.165 --> 39:43.432
I am a police officer,

39:43.467 --> 39:45.268
and I have an example to set for

39:45.302 --> 39:47.103
the fine people I protect and serve.

39:47.137 --> 39:48.471
- I'm this way.
- All right.

40:10.427 --> 40:14.363
Mariana? Some of your
guests are starting to leave.

40:14.398 --> 40:15.564
What's the matter? Aren't
you having a good time?

40:15.599 --> 40:18.401
- I'm sorry.
- For what?

40:18.435 --> 40:21.270
For being selfish.

40:21.305 --> 40:24.540
Honey, what are you talking about?

40:24.574 --> 40:27.209
This party.

40:27.244 --> 40:31.580
It cost so much and
you both worked so hard.

40:31.615 --> 40:35.384
I didn't dance with you. I
should've danced with you.

40:35.419 --> 40:38.421
I have the best moms in the world

40:38.455 --> 40:40.323
and I should've danced with you.

40:40.357 --> 40:42.558
- Baby.
- Honey, it's ok.

40:42.592 --> 40:45.261
No, it's not.

40:45.295 --> 40:48.431
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:48.465 --> 40:51.434
You know what you need?

40:51.468 --> 40:53.402
A mama sandwich!

40:53.437 --> 40:56.305
- No!
- Yes! Mommy sandwich!

40:58.442 --> 41:02.378
- We love you.
- I love you, too.

41:02.412 --> 41:07.316
Lexi, I'm not letting you leave
here without dancing with me.

41:46.456 --> 41:48.324
Did I say it was formal?

41:48.358 --> 41:51.427
I just assumed.

41:51.461 --> 41:53.529
You look dumb in that dress.

41:53.563 --> 41:56.399
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

41:56.433 --> 41:59.268
Do you want a beer?
