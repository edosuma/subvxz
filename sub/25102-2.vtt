WEBVTT

00:00.467 --> 00:01.466
So, this is how you're
laundering the money.

00:01.468 --> 00:02.867
I want to learn.

00:02.869 --> 00:04.402
Come here. I want you to meet
Morgan Wilson.

00:04.404 --> 00:09.074
I want my grandson J given
my power of attorney now.

00:09.076 --> 00:12.077
Hey, taking one last shot
at the Q.S.

00:12.079 --> 00:13.145
What about school?

00:13.147 --> 00:14.679
I'll make it up
next semester.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.749
See you when I get back.

00:16.751 --> 00:18.817
Do you know
a Barry Blackwell?

00:18.819 --> 00:20.352
Yeah, he's my brother.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.353
We were
responding officers

00:21.355 --> 00:22.755
to a shooting last night.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.757
He was found with several
gunshot wounds to his chest.

00:24.759 --> 00:26.491
I can't believe Baz is dead.

00:26.493 --> 00:27.960
My dad's dead?

00:27.962 --> 00:30.094
Who's gonna
take care of Lena?

00:30.096 --> 00:31.430
Does she end up
in foster care?

00:31.432 --> 00:33.498
She's not going
into foster care.

00:33.500 --> 00:36.769
J, I need you to pay those
people I asked you to pay.

00:36.771 --> 00:37.970
Yeah, I already did.

00:37.972 --> 00:39.772
I need you to
pay them again.

00:39.774 --> 00:41.840
- How are you?
- Good to see you!

00:41.842 --> 00:43.175
Sit down.
Let me make you something.

00:43.177 --> 00:44.643
Do you mind if I use
your bathroom real quick?

00:44.645 --> 00:45.778
Go ahead.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.449
So, you're really going
back down to Mexico, huh?

00:51.451 --> 00:53.719
I need
to find something for me.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.557
I'm gonna find out
who killed my brother.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:29.069 --> 04:30.735
You got the money?

04:30.737 --> 04:32.937
Hold this.
Let me see.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.807
It's all there.

04:34.809 --> 04:36.941
Chair 4 at 11:00.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.343
I'm buying.
Sal's.

04:38.345 --> 04:39.611
No.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.546
- Your place, then.
- No. Go home.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.615
Order a pizza, make sure
the delivery guy sees you.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.217
I'm amped.
Come on, let's celebrate.

04:45.219 --> 04:47.353
Go home and jack off, then.
I'll see you tomorrow.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.443
You're missing it.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.777
Got work to do.

05:12.779 --> 05:15.514
Come on, we're playing Kings.
Just like sophomore year.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.449
Stop, stop.

05:17.451 --> 05:19.317
Okay.
What is this shit?

05:19.319 --> 05:21.053
Bills.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.988
Utilities, property tax,
insurance.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.457
Smurf owns all of
these buildings,

05:25.459 --> 05:27.526
but there's not enough money
coming in.

05:27.528 --> 05:28.927
What about the rents?

05:28.929 --> 05:30.262
It's not enough
to cover it all.

05:30.264 --> 05:32.130
Okay, well, you have to
tell the pool guy to come,

05:32.132 --> 05:34.999
because there's a dead bird
in the filter, and it's nasty.

05:35.001 --> 05:36.268
Yeah,
I fired the pool guy.

05:36.270 --> 05:37.870
We can't keep spending money
on stupid shit.

05:37.872 --> 05:39.337
I'll deal with it.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.205
Okay.

05:40.207 --> 05:42.407
Come find me.
- Okay.

07:01.956 --> 07:03.355
How you guys doing?

07:03.357 --> 07:04.757
Doing all right?
You need anything?

07:06.026 --> 07:07.960
- Man, what's up?
- How you doing?

07:13.434 --> 07:15.100
Hey.

07:15.102 --> 07:17.770
Can't do any more work.
My eyes hurt.

07:17.772 --> 07:19.972
How we lookin'?

07:19.974 --> 07:21.640
Last call was
about 20 minutes ago,

07:21.642 --> 07:24.176
but none of these assholes
are leaving.

07:24.178 --> 07:26.979
Just stop serving them alcohol.
They'll leave.

07:45.532 --> 07:47.533
Can I watch TV?

07:49.804 --> 07:52.204
It's 2:00
in the morning.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.008
What was it tonight?

07:56.010 --> 07:58.043
Wolves.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.681
All right, um...

08:02.683 --> 08:06.018
30 minutes, but then you have to
go back to bed, okay?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.632
You know, you shouldn't be
scared of wolves.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.300
They're loyal
pack animals,

08:22.302 --> 08:24.636
and they almost never
attack people.

08:24.638 --> 08:28.907
The rangers put them
back into Yellowstone,

08:28.909 --> 08:31.109
turned the whole park
around.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.179
There's wolves
at the park?

08:36.049 --> 08:37.782
In Wyoming.

08:37.784 --> 08:39.318
It's far away.

08:45.059 --> 08:47.493
You're not gonna sleep,
are you?

08:51.998 --> 08:53.432
Did they find
who shot him?

08:56.803 --> 08:57.903
You okay?

08:59.606 --> 09:03.808
If somebody was coming for us,
they would've come already.

09:03.810 --> 09:05.610
That's not what I meant.

09:05.612 --> 09:09.281
Oh.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.084
I'm fine.

09:12.086 --> 09:16.255
Jesus. Can we talk about
something else, please?

09:17.892 --> 09:19.091
I like your hair.

09:19.093 --> 09:21.093
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

09:21.095 --> 09:23.762
Having a midlife crisis?

09:23.764 --> 09:27.165
No, I just got itchy.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.700
Is Craig giving you shit?

09:28.702 --> 09:31.436
No, I haven't seen Craig
in a couple months.

09:31.438 --> 09:33.572
Where is he?

09:33.574 --> 09:35.908
He's in Mexico,
I think.

09:35.910 --> 09:38.444
You think?

09:40.447 --> 09:42.781
Who knows
with that kid.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.049
You want another drink?

09:45.051 --> 09:46.719
It's late.
Um...

09:46.721 --> 09:50.122
I should go, I guess.

09:50.124 --> 09:52.457
Yeah,
you should probably go.

09:52.459 --> 09:54.859
That might be good.

09:54.861 --> 09:56.996
You should probably go.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.144
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

10:12.146 --> 10:14.480
I thought you said
you had to go.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.749
I don't know about you,

10:17.751 --> 10:21.754
but I was just gonna get naked
and hang out in the back,

10:21.756 --> 10:23.288
but if you have to go...

10:23.290 --> 10:25.224
Shut up.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.369
Hey.

11:10.371 --> 11:12.504
You catch a couple more
sets?

11:12.506 --> 11:13.972
Called Manuel.

11:13.974 --> 11:16.375
He's got a hook-up
with a worm guy.

11:16.377 --> 11:19.043
I thought real tequila
doesn't have a worm in it.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.845
It doesn't.

11:20.847 --> 11:24.516
But Manuel's guy is breeding
electric-blue worms.

11:24.518 --> 11:28.520
- Ooh.
- It's all about marketability.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.526
I like this, uh,
"business Craig."

11:34.528 --> 11:36.929
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

11:36.931 --> 11:39.598
So, I got the cook coming in
from Pescado's tonight.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.066
Yeah?

11:41.068 --> 11:42.401
Happy birthday.

11:42.403 --> 11:44.269
It's not my birthday.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.204
Well, you're wearing
your birthday suit.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.507
Could be.

11:54.148 --> 11:56.081
You're gonna be late.

12:01.756 --> 12:03.288
What are you doing?

12:03.290 --> 12:04.556
I'm sick.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.557
No, you're not.

12:05.559 --> 12:06.558
Yes, I am.

12:06.560 --> 12:09.561
Nope.
You're not sick.

12:11.966 --> 12:15.834
If you miss too much school,
your teacher's gonna call DCFS.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.569
Is that the police?

12:17.571 --> 12:19.037
No.

12:19.039 --> 12:21.640
No, no.
Don't worry about it.

12:21.642 --> 12:24.509
Come on.
There's cereal.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.711
I'm not hungry.

12:26.713 --> 12:28.580
Breakfast is important.

12:28.582 --> 12:29.782
Why?

12:33.120 --> 12:36.120
Ms. Henry
wants to talk to you.

12:36.122 --> 12:38.023
About what?

12:41.728 --> 12:43.962
What is this?

12:51.538 --> 12:53.205
Lena?

12:53.207 --> 12:54.840
What happened?

12:56.010 --> 12:58.210
Nothing.
We're gonna be late.

12:58.212 --> 12:59.944
Lena,
tell me what happened.

12:59.946 --> 13:02.481
I don't want
to talk about it.

13:05.085 --> 13:07.352
Ohhh.

13:07.354 --> 13:09.287
You need to get a real bed.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.823
I have a real bed.

13:10.825 --> 13:13.225
A mattress in an attic
is not a bed.

13:13.227 --> 13:15.360
You hungry?

13:15.362 --> 13:16.695
Oh. Thanks.

13:16.697 --> 13:18.563
Here you go.

13:18.565 --> 13:23.168
Let me get a little
sauce on there.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.037
There you go.

13:28.843 --> 13:31.176
Mmm.
These are actually pretty good.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.644
It's ranchero.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.379
We make it in-house.

13:34.381 --> 13:35.848
- "In-house"?
- Uh-huh.

13:35.850 --> 13:37.782
You're looking at
a restaurateur, kid.

13:39.720 --> 13:41.586
So, you got
the European qualifiers

13:41.588 --> 13:43.588
at A CoruÃ±a next,
right?

13:43.590 --> 13:45.190
When are you leaving?

13:45.192 --> 13:47.259
I'm not.

13:47.261 --> 13:49.728
What do you mean?

13:49.730 --> 13:51.730
I've surfed five events.

13:51.732 --> 13:53.265
Made it past the first round
twice.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.535
Okay.
Well, it's heat by heat.

13:56.537 --> 13:58.670
You know that.
It's your first year.

13:58.672 --> 14:01.005
Yeah, well, sponsors
aren't exactly lining up

14:01.007 --> 14:04.143
to hand me 60 grand to
fly around the world and lose.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.012
You have the ability.

14:08.014 --> 14:11.684
It's just a mental game,
so you're in your head too much.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.822
I'm going back to UCSD.

14:19.093 --> 14:21.359
Plenty of people have
a rough first year.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.294
Okay?
Look at A.I.

14:22.296 --> 14:24.496
Took him, what,
two years to qualify?

14:24.498 --> 14:27.232
I don't have two years
or $100,000.

14:27.234 --> 14:30.502
All right.

14:30.504 --> 14:32.304
I liked college.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.340
It's not
the end of the world.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.643
I got to...
I got to go meet Tao.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.813
See if I can
get my old job back.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.515
You didn't eat.
You want to take this to-go?

14:43.517 --> 14:44.917
No, no.

14:44.919 --> 14:46.251
Hey, maybe I'll see you later,
though.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.519
I...

14:47.521 --> 14:48.653
I'm around now,
so...

14:48.655 --> 14:50.655
Okay.

14:50.657 --> 14:53.025
See you later.

14:55.195 --> 14:57.529
Goodwin worked through
his retainer and then some.

14:57.531 --> 14:59.264
Hm. What's this?

14:59.266 --> 15:01.767
His bill.

15:03.870 --> 15:05.203
You're kidding me.

15:05.205 --> 15:06.538
I'm not.

15:06.540 --> 15:09.108
And I don't need it right away,
but mine's in there, as well.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.611
When's it due?

15:12.613 --> 15:14.012
His is due now.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.214
He's a highly sought-after
criminal defense attorney.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.149
He doesn't come cheap.

15:17.151 --> 15:19.752
Yeah,
you know we're good for it.

15:19.754 --> 15:22.421
If you're having
some cash-flow problems,

15:22.423 --> 15:24.957
Josh, you can talk to me.
I'm your attorney, too.

15:24.959 --> 15:27.892
That means our conversations
are privileged.

15:29.696 --> 15:33.498
Smurf's got a lot of bills
that I'm not sure how to cover.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.699
You have to pay the bills.

15:34.701 --> 15:35.768
Tens of thousands of dollars

15:35.770 --> 15:37.235
run through Smurf's buildings
every month.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.904
If rent stops just because
Smurf goes to jail,

15:39.906 --> 15:41.774
it might give the cops
the impression

15:41.776 --> 15:43.108
that her
real-estate business

15:43.110 --> 15:45.911
is nothing more than
a money-laundering operation.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.315
Have you talked
to your uncles?

15:50.317 --> 15:52.985
They won't work,
not for Smurf.

15:52.987 --> 15:56.989
If I wanted to sell a building,
how would I do that?

15:56.991 --> 15:58.390
Oh, you can't.

15:58.392 --> 15:59.391
Not right now, anyway.

15:59.393 --> 16:01.726
The D.A.'s looking into
Smurf's finances.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.195
You sell a building,

16:03.197 --> 16:06.264
it gives them a more complete
picture of her business.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.667
Although we could do
a private sale.

16:08.669 --> 16:10.202
What's that?

16:10.204 --> 16:12.471
Well, you sign over
several properties

16:12.473 --> 16:14.272
to a corporation in my name.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.075
I get a mortgage on it,
I front Goodwin the cash,

16:17.077 --> 16:19.144
I give some to you
to cover the bills.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.547
But that would mean that
you own the properties.

16:22.549 --> 16:27.085
We could sort that out
when Smurf gets out.

16:27.087 --> 16:29.021
If she gets out.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.758
No.

16:33.760 --> 16:34.827
Not yet.

16:34.829 --> 16:36.862
I'll let you know
if it comes to that.

16:38.032 --> 16:39.564
Okay, good.

16:39.566 --> 16:42.034
We wouldn't want Smurf to
end up with a public defender

16:42.036 --> 16:43.902
straight out of UC Irvine,
right?

16:43.904 --> 16:46.905
No.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.248
Hey.

16:56.250 --> 16:58.650
What the hell
are you doing here?

16:58.652 --> 17:00.886
I got the police file.

17:04.790 --> 17:06.991
The neighbors
didn't see anything,

17:06.992 --> 17:09.862
and there are no cameras
on the Strand.

17:09.864 --> 17:12.897
How much
did this cost you?

17:15.935 --> 17:18.737
He used a 9 millimeter.

17:18.739 --> 17:21.406
Hollow points.

17:21.407 --> 17:23.942
What about Javi's crew?

17:23.944 --> 17:27.746
One was in jail
for a parole violation,

17:27.748 --> 17:31.149
and the other two were in
Arizona the night Baz was shot.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.151
Any other suspects?

17:33.153 --> 17:35.220
Anyone we know?

17:35.222 --> 17:37.222
No.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.992
The cops are still
looking for you.

17:46.032 --> 17:48.032
What about Smurf?

17:48.034 --> 17:49.834
Have you talked to her
at all?

17:56.443 --> 17:59.044
I think
I left some stuff here.

18:00.114 --> 18:04.383
If you need that stuff,
go ahead and get it.

18:04.385 --> 18:07.385
Yeah.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.541
Where are you sleeping?

18:31.011 --> 18:32.311
The couch.

18:39.486 --> 18:41.019
What's that?

18:41.021 --> 18:44.689
What kind of kid

18:44.691 --> 18:47.426
bullies a sweet little girl
about her dead dad?

18:47.428 --> 18:49.628
Is Lena being bullied
at school?

18:49.630 --> 18:51.296
Someone kicked her.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.698
Couple of girls
cornered her in a bathroom

18:53.700 --> 18:56.100
and told her that
her dad was a criminal.

18:56.102 --> 18:58.036
This is just what the...
the teachers tell me,

18:58.038 --> 18:59.838
and she won't talk to me.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.306
But I know
she's having nightmares,

19:01.308 --> 19:03.708
and she wakes up every day,
she says she's sick,

19:03.710 --> 19:05.177
she doesn't want
to go to school.

19:05.179 --> 19:06.911
And what? What?
I'm supposed to make her go?

19:06.913 --> 19:10.315
This shit is happening
every day.

19:10.317 --> 19:12.851
Are you getting
any help with her?

19:12.853 --> 19:16.922
I don't need help.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.459
Got something to say?
Okay, go ahead.

19:20.461 --> 19:21.994
Bitch,
we got a problem?

19:21.996 --> 19:24.128
Yeah, we got a problem.

19:24.130 --> 19:25.998
This bitch.

19:31.605 --> 19:34.173
You're Smurf Cody
from Oceanside.

19:35.676 --> 19:37.342
Have we met?

19:37.344 --> 19:39.344
My asshole boyfriend
robbed a liquor store,

19:39.346 --> 19:41.413
left me holding the bag.

19:41.415 --> 19:43.348
Now I'm looking at
two years.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.484
Like I give a shit.

19:45.486 --> 19:50.355
We had a bigger score going
before I got picked up.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.292
I want to hit it
before he can.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.628
You could
get your boys to do it.

19:56.630 --> 19:59.898
No idea
what you're talking about.

20:01.101 --> 20:03.402
Everybody knows about you.

20:05.105 --> 20:08.240
You have me confused
with someone else.

20:08.242 --> 20:11.643
I'm just
someone's grandma.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.778
It's an easy score.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.380
Tons of cash.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.461
Jesus Christ.
What are you guys doing here?

20:30.597 --> 20:32.931
I said Chair 4 at 11:00.
What are you doing here?

20:32.933 --> 20:34.599
Sully got picked up.

20:34.601 --> 20:35.668
For what?

20:35.670 --> 20:37.135
I don't know.

20:37.137 --> 20:39.872
Mariah was at Sal's,
saw him taken out in cuffs.

20:43.277 --> 20:45.177
You think he's talking?

20:46.813 --> 20:48.981
Shit.

21:09.503 --> 21:11.437
Some fun ones this morning,
huh?

21:11.439 --> 21:13.305
Yeah,
I saw you score a couple.

21:13.307 --> 21:14.372
Yeah.

21:14.374 --> 21:15.841
So, uh...

21:15.843 --> 21:17.575
I got to borrow her
a second.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.710
What's up?

21:18.712 --> 21:21.713
Aah!

21:21.715 --> 21:22.848
Whoo!

21:22.850 --> 21:26.118
Get it!

21:26.120 --> 21:27.453
Yo!

21:27.455 --> 21:28.720
What the hell
are you doing?!

21:28.722 --> 21:31.056
You going through
my shit?

21:36.796 --> 21:38.664
- Cute.
- Come on, let's go.

21:38.666 --> 21:40.132
Smart ass.

21:40.134 --> 21:42.067
Yo!

21:42.069 --> 21:43.601
Yo!

21:43.603 --> 21:45.270
Who brought this kid?

21:45.272 --> 21:47.873
He's going through my shit,
sniffing my underwear.

21:47.875 --> 21:49.607
- CabrÃ³n.
- Wait. What was that?

21:49.609 --> 21:51.877
How old are you, Pichacorta?
Huh?

21:53.080 --> 21:55.481
Yo, is anyone gonna
own this little thief?

21:55.483 --> 21:57.883
Huh?
Anyone?

21:57.885 --> 22:00.952
Look, I'm not
some lame-ass tourist.

22:00.954 --> 22:04.222
You want to roll someone,
find a dentist on a vacation.

22:04.224 --> 22:06.424
Â¿Comprende?

22:06.426 --> 22:08.760
Hey?

22:08.762 --> 22:10.663
You want some money?

22:14.301 --> 22:16.835
All right.

22:30.918 --> 22:33.451
Thanks, man.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.287
How much was bail?

22:39.860 --> 22:42.161
I'll pay you back,
whatever it was.

22:44.532 --> 22:46.798
I'm sorry, okay?

22:46.800 --> 22:48.867
It wasn't my fault.

22:48.869 --> 22:50.736
Guy got in my face.

22:50.738 --> 22:53.471
I should have gone home,
I know.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.874
Next time, okay?

23:01.281 --> 23:04.383
Do, uh, Colby and Ox know
I got busted?

23:05.619 --> 23:08.020
Say something, D.
You're freaking me out.

23:11.225 --> 23:12.858
Where, uh...
Where we going?

23:14.762 --> 23:17.829
What are you, like, trying to
scare me or something?

23:24.438 --> 23:27.172
Hey, baby.

23:27.174 --> 23:28.440
Hi.

23:28.442 --> 23:29.374
How's Pope?

23:29.376 --> 23:31.243
Did he
threaten you again?

23:31.245 --> 23:33.845
No.
But he's still glaring at me.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.847
That's Pope.

23:35.849 --> 23:37.849
He's mourning.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.485
Stay out of his way.

23:42.322 --> 23:44.923
Are you boys
being careful?

23:44.925 --> 23:46.392
We're being careful.

23:48.462 --> 23:50.996
J...

23:50.998 --> 23:53.398
when the Trujillos
call you,

23:53.400 --> 23:55.601
pick up
your goddamn phone.

23:55.603 --> 23:57.002
And pay them on time.

23:57.004 --> 23:59.004
The bills are piling up,
Smurf.

23:59.006 --> 24:01.006
Go ask your uncles
for help.

24:01.008 --> 24:02.975
They won't do it.

24:05.145 --> 24:07.212
Didn't Baz give everybody
a shitload of money?

24:07.214 --> 24:09.081
They won't do it
if they know it's for you.

24:09.083 --> 24:12.151
You don't tell them
it's for me.

24:16.090 --> 24:18.424
I'm sorry.
I know you're taking on a lot,

24:18.426 --> 24:20.793
and if you can't handle it...
- I can handle it.

24:24.231 --> 24:26.432
Call Morgan.

24:26.434 --> 24:29.435
Tell her to get Goodwin here...
today.

24:29.437 --> 24:32.304
Goodwin's gone through
his retainer.

24:32.306 --> 24:35.373
She brought me his bill
this morning.

24:35.375 --> 24:37.042
And hers.

24:37.044 --> 24:38.977
She's got some balls.

24:38.979 --> 24:42.781
I paid that bitch to sit
on her ass for 22 years...

24:42.783 --> 24:44.516
Well,
what should I do?

24:44.518 --> 24:48.987
Pay Goodwin whatever he needs
to get me in front of a judge.

24:48.989 --> 24:51.056
The sooner
I'm in a courthouse,

24:51.058 --> 24:54.192
the sooner this bullshit case
falls apart.

24:54.194 --> 24:56.128
Goodwin wants 10 grand.

24:56.130 --> 24:59.565
Well, I guess you're gonna have
to use your own stash, then.

25:01.535 --> 25:04.269
Oh, come on, baby.

25:04.271 --> 25:07.906
I know you have
your own stash.

25:10.077 --> 25:15.481
My boys
never missed a meal.

25:15.483 --> 25:17.082
Not you, baby.

25:17.084 --> 25:19.818
You have gone hungry.

25:19.820 --> 25:24.156
You have slept in cars,
just like me.

25:24.158 --> 25:28.394
You have a Plan B.

25:30.964 --> 25:33.031
Who should I pay first?

25:33.033 --> 25:34.700
Goodwin
or the Trujillos?

25:34.702 --> 25:36.634
Both, baby.

25:36.636 --> 25:39.037
You pay them both.

25:43.777 --> 25:47.346
Yo, J,
you're dodging my calls.

25:48.582 --> 25:49.981
You followed me here?

25:49.983 --> 25:52.050
You visit Smurf every Tuesday
and Thursday.

25:52.052 --> 25:54.052
I don't got to
be a genius.

25:54.054 --> 25:57.055
I'll get you your money
this afternoon, okay?

25:57.057 --> 25:58.524
I needed it
two days ago.

25:58.526 --> 25:59.991
Yeah, well,
I haven't got it on me.

25:59.993 --> 26:01.459
I'll swing by your house
in a couple hours.

26:01.461 --> 26:03.529
How about that?
- That's not gonna work.

26:03.531 --> 26:07.099
I'll hang with you
until you got the money.

26:31.158 --> 26:32.424
Get out.

26:32.426 --> 26:35.160
I didn't say shit,
all right?

26:35.162 --> 26:37.162
They didn't even ask.
It was a bullshit D&D charge.

26:37.164 --> 26:38.664
They don't know
about the cars.

26:43.971 --> 26:45.703
You're paranoid, dude.

26:45.705 --> 26:46.905
I'm not wearing a wire.

26:46.907 --> 26:48.574
I got in a bar fight.

26:52.179 --> 26:54.112
Get on the ground.

26:54.114 --> 26:56.181
All right, I get it.

26:56.183 --> 26:57.715
You're pissed.

26:57.717 --> 27:00.586
I'm sorry, but this is
stupid gangster shit, Deran.

27:00.588 --> 27:02.621
Take a piece of my cut
or something, dock my pay.

27:04.258 --> 27:06.724
Get on the ground
and put your face in the dirt.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.193
Are you serious?

27:11.932 --> 27:12.998
Look at me.

27:13.000 --> 27:14.933
Look at me!

27:18.205 --> 27:21.640
If you ever say my name again,
I will find you.

27:23.744 --> 27:27.679
And if I can't,
because I'm in prison,

27:27.681 --> 27:30.682
say, because some asshole
decided to run his mouth,

27:30.684 --> 27:33.619
well, there are
a lot of Codys...

27:33.621 --> 27:36.021
and I'm the nice one.

27:36.023 --> 27:38.624
Ohh!

27:56.010 --> 27:57.810
So,
you're not Smurf's kid?

27:57.812 --> 27:59.011
She's my grandmother.

27:59.013 --> 28:01.013
How come her kids aren't
collecting the rents?

28:01.015 --> 28:04.282
Because
she asked me to do it.

28:04.284 --> 28:06.551
So, what, you're, like,
the favorite or something?

28:06.553 --> 28:09.354
I don't know.
You got to ask her.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.755
Oh.

28:10.757 --> 28:13.025
They got you doing
the bitch work, man.

28:13.027 --> 28:16.561
I collect the rents,
and you collect off me.

28:16.563 --> 28:18.897
So I guess we're both
doing bitch work, huh?

28:21.836 --> 28:23.502
This is a sick truck,
bro.

28:23.504 --> 28:25.237
This cost
like $40,000?

28:25.239 --> 28:28.373
Yeah,
something like that.

28:28.375 --> 28:30.509
Ah.
How are your payments?

28:30.511 --> 28:32.511
I paid cash.

28:32.513 --> 28:34.112
You own this?

28:34.114 --> 28:35.714
Yeah.

28:35.716 --> 28:38.717
Look at you.

28:38.719 --> 28:42.054
Probably shouldn't be
four days late on a payment

28:42.056 --> 28:44.989
if you've got a $40,000 truck,
though.

28:44.991 --> 28:47.793
Just sayin'.

28:50.865 --> 28:52.931
The last one
was pretty good.

28:52.933 --> 28:55.934
You're the creepy dude on the
beach staring at the surfers.

28:55.936 --> 28:57.770
You should know that.

28:58.939 --> 29:00.773
You belong on the tour.

29:02.276 --> 29:03.475
No, I don't.

29:03.477 --> 29:05.410
You should've seen me
at Ballito.

29:05.412 --> 29:07.479
I got smoked
in the first round.

29:07.481 --> 29:11.015
No, you had
the highest-scoring wave.

29:11.017 --> 29:14.486
All you needed
was a 2.5 to advance.

29:14.488 --> 29:16.421
I watched.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.356
At 3:00 a.m.?

29:18.358 --> 29:19.691
I was up.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.364
I'll give you
$50K to start.

29:26.366 --> 29:27.700
Should get you through
the first few months.

29:27.702 --> 29:29.568
What are you talking about?

29:29.570 --> 29:31.169
I'll sponsor you.

29:31.171 --> 29:33.972
We'll split the endorsements
when they start rolling in,

29:33.974 --> 29:35.107
and...
- Ah, I can't let you do that.

29:35.109 --> 29:36.975
I want to do it.

29:40.046 --> 29:43.181
Uh, I can't take money
from your family.

29:43.183 --> 29:45.951
It's my money.

29:48.054 --> 29:50.522
You don't have to keep
saying you're sorry.

29:53.794 --> 29:55.260
Listen.

29:55.262 --> 29:57.596
If you quit now,
you'll regret it.

29:57.598 --> 30:00.265
Trust me.

30:00.267 --> 30:02.868
I want to do this for you.
Let me.

30:05.205 --> 30:07.606
Don't throw your life away
on college.

30:09.810 --> 30:10.943
That's good advice.

30:10.945 --> 30:12.677
Mm.

30:12.679 --> 30:15.013
Is that your plan?

30:15.015 --> 30:16.615
To just let me rot
in here?

30:16.617 --> 30:18.016
I was here last week.

30:18.018 --> 30:20.218
Why don't you try
eating powdered eggs

30:20.220 --> 30:21.553
and kissing up
to a guard

30:21.555 --> 30:24.689
while your lawyers
bleed you dry?

30:24.691 --> 30:26.425
A good defense
costs money.

30:26.427 --> 30:29.494
When am I gonna see
a good defense?

30:29.496 --> 30:32.297
Goodwin isn't doing anything
until he gets paid.

30:32.299 --> 30:34.499
What the hell
is going on here?!

30:34.501 --> 30:37.235
We need to see
their evidence.

30:37.237 --> 30:40.773
The minute the judge
gets ahold of Javi's autopsy,

30:40.775 --> 30:42.307
I am out of here!

30:42.309 --> 30:44.909
Janine,
the D.A. doesn't give two shits

30:44.911 --> 30:46.645
about the autopsy report.

30:46.647 --> 30:50.048
She's stalling for as long as
it takes to build a real case!

30:50.050 --> 30:51.383
What's that
supposed to mean?

30:51.385 --> 30:53.585
They're making inquiries
about your businesses.

30:53.587 --> 30:55.920
They're subpoenaing
tax returns.

30:55.922 --> 30:57.522
Somewhere in San Diego,

30:57.524 --> 30:59.057
Pearce has got a bulletin board
with your picture

30:59.059 --> 31:01.059
in the middle of
a mess of red string.

31:01.061 --> 31:05.597
Pearce is trying to make this
a RICO case.

31:05.599 --> 31:08.133
Do me a favor.

31:08.135 --> 31:11.336
You tell J
to get Goodwin his money

31:11.338 --> 31:13.806
without drawing attention
to your assets.

31:13.808 --> 31:16.208
Wouldn't want to give the D.A.
the impression

31:16.210 --> 31:18.877
that you're running
a criminal organization.

31:18.879 --> 31:20.079
Right?

31:24.819 --> 31:28.086
Mm.

31:28.088 --> 31:32.324
What do you think of
the name Agua Agrio?

31:33.828 --> 31:35.760
It's a name
for the tequila.

31:35.762 --> 31:38.096
Sour Water?

31:38.098 --> 31:39.431
You think it's stupid.

31:39.433 --> 31:41.433
No.

31:41.435 --> 31:43.368
I don't.
Just give me a minute.

31:43.370 --> 31:46.705
Ozzy's uncle
works in branding.

31:46.707 --> 31:49.842
And he was saying that
I should have a name and a logo

31:49.844 --> 31:51.710
before
we talk to investors.

31:51.712 --> 31:54.646
Agua Agrio.
Okay.

31:56.050 --> 31:59.184
"Hey, give me a shot of
Agua Agrio."

32:01.188 --> 32:02.521
It's stupid.

32:02.523 --> 32:04.189
- No, stop! It's not.
- Forget it, forget it.

32:06.460 --> 32:08.460
Yo,
what happened to the music?

32:17.204 --> 32:19.271
What's up?

32:19.273 --> 32:20.739
Do I know you?

32:20.741 --> 32:22.207
No.

32:48.969 --> 32:51.503
He's pissed
about the parties.

32:51.505 --> 32:53.238
Says you're shutting down
restaurants,

32:53.240 --> 32:54.306
keeping people awake.

32:54.308 --> 32:56.308
Tell him
we'll keep it down.

32:56.310 --> 32:59.745
Everybody's welcome.

33:14.595 --> 33:16.729
Who's gonna help him
with this coke?

33:20.200 --> 33:22.368
More for you, I guess.

33:24.004 --> 33:25.704
Miguel.

33:28.675 --> 33:32.277
Look, man, he was in my house,
stealing my shit.

33:39.886 --> 33:41.219
Get off him!

33:41.221 --> 33:42.955
You want a piece of
this, too, chica?

33:42.957 --> 33:45.890
1, 2, 3, 4 of you?

33:45.892 --> 33:47.091
That's it?

33:47.093 --> 33:48.360
Get off! Craig!

34:05.613 --> 34:07.212
I'll be two minutes.

34:07.214 --> 34:09.014
Stay in the car, please.

34:15.422 --> 34:18.290
J,
this is a nice surprise.

34:18.292 --> 34:20.292
- Hey. How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

34:20.293 --> 34:22.092
I'm good, I'm good.
I was just in the neighborhood.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.360
I thought I'd swing by.

34:23.362 --> 34:25.630
Nice.
Appreciate that.

34:25.632 --> 34:27.498
Is this Nicky?

34:27.501 --> 34:29.900
Yeah.
Nice to meet you.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.637
She's kidding.
This is Mia.

34:31.639 --> 34:33.304
Okay, Mia.

34:33.306 --> 34:34.572
Y'all got time
for some dinner?

34:34.574 --> 34:36.241
No, uh...
No, we can't.

34:36.243 --> 34:38.109
We got stuff to do,
so I...

34:38.110 --> 34:40.578
We're not in a rush.

34:40.580 --> 34:42.179
You got any beer?

34:42.181 --> 34:43.716
Yeah.

34:45.453 --> 34:47.719
I guess
we'll stay for one.

34:47.721 --> 34:49.355
Nice.

35:00.200 --> 35:03.401
So...

35:03.403 --> 35:05.403
Smurf never made me
go to school.

35:05.405 --> 35:07.272
She didn't see the point.

35:07.274 --> 35:09.074
I used to get into fights,

35:09.076 --> 35:13.545
I used to... punch people.

35:13.547 --> 35:16.548
One time,
I lit a teacher's desk on fire.

35:17.617 --> 35:20.752
And Grandma Smurf, she...
she didn't want the hassle.

35:20.754 --> 35:22.821
So she let me skip it.

35:22.823 --> 35:26.224
I hate it there.

35:26.226 --> 35:27.759
School sucks.

35:27.761 --> 35:31.830
But you are smart
like your mom,

35:31.832 --> 35:34.533
and she'd want you to go,
so you're going.

35:43.911 --> 35:45.177
Pick one.

35:45.179 --> 35:47.112
What?

35:47.114 --> 35:49.181
Go ahead.
Pick a school.

35:49.183 --> 35:51.116
These are for rich kids.

35:51.118 --> 35:54.353
What the hell
do you think you are?

36:05.599 --> 36:07.465
How long
have you lived here?

36:07.467 --> 36:10.536
Well, J's whole life,
at least.

36:10.538 --> 36:12.538
He and his mom
lived across the way.

36:12.540 --> 36:15.741
You're friends
with J's mom?

36:15.743 --> 36:18.610
We were like sisters.

36:18.612 --> 36:20.879
Were?

36:22.950 --> 36:24.316
She's dead.

36:27.154 --> 36:29.621
How'd she die?

36:29.623 --> 36:31.557
Heroin.

36:36.564 --> 36:38.764
It's painless,
at least.

36:38.766 --> 36:40.866
My mom got stabbed.

36:43.303 --> 36:45.237
Sorry to hear that.

36:46.373 --> 36:48.106
Anybody want another?

36:48.108 --> 36:49.174
- Yeah.
- J?

36:49.176 --> 36:50.609
I got to drive.

36:58.052 --> 37:00.586
Is that supposed to scare me?

37:00.588 --> 37:01.920
What?

37:01.922 --> 37:04.389
Talking about your mom
getting stabbed to death.

37:04.391 --> 37:06.858
My mom got stabbed.

37:06.860 --> 37:08.360
You want me to
lie about it?

37:09.797 --> 37:11.797
Forget about it.

37:11.799 --> 37:13.465
When you're getting to know
somebody,

37:13.467 --> 37:15.267
you ask them questions.

37:15.269 --> 37:17.436
You tell them
shit about yourself.

37:19.940 --> 37:21.273
Thanks for the tip.

37:23.743 --> 37:27.813
My mom was a junkie, so...
we got that in common.

37:34.288 --> 37:36.221
Here you go, Mia.

37:36.223 --> 37:38.356
Dina,
could I use your bathroom?

37:38.358 --> 37:39.891
Sure.

38:05.185 --> 38:07.486
I guess
I was wrong about you.

38:09.056 --> 38:10.656
What are you
talking about?

38:10.658 --> 38:14.192
She said Smurf cut your mom off
and left you guys with nothing.

38:14.194 --> 38:16.261
Says you almost starved.

38:17.197 --> 38:20.532
Maybe you're not a completely
spoiled little bitch.

38:23.804 --> 38:25.371
I'm kidding.

38:26.874 --> 38:28.406
You never laugh.

38:28.408 --> 38:30.776
That's 'cause
you're not funny.

38:39.419 --> 38:41.387
Where do you want me to
drop you off?

38:47.427 --> 38:48.894
Who's Nicky?

38:58.105 --> 38:59.838
What are you doing?

38:59.840 --> 39:01.774
What does it look like?

39:12.786 --> 39:14.586
Stop.

39:14.588 --> 39:16.388
I'll tell you
when to move.

39:26.266 --> 39:28.066
What's wrong with her?

39:28.068 --> 39:29.935
Who?

39:29.937 --> 39:32.137
Alvarez.

39:32.139 --> 39:33.739
She's a crazy bitch.

39:33.741 --> 39:35.974
Shot her boyfriend
in the middle of a robbery.

39:38.478 --> 39:40.546
Where's she from?

39:40.548 --> 39:42.680
Why do you care?

39:42.682 --> 39:44.450
Maybe I'm interested.

39:46.820 --> 39:49.287
You don't need
any more friends in here.

39:49.289 --> 39:52.725
Where is she from?

40:16.384 --> 40:19.050
Where you been?

40:19.052 --> 40:20.652
Pope and Deran
are here?

40:20.654 --> 40:22.788
It's Tuesday.
Lena?

40:22.790 --> 40:25.723
Dinner?
- Oh, shit.

40:25.725 --> 40:28.126
What is all this stuff?

40:28.128 --> 40:30.862
Oh, I got some things for
the house and some clothes.

40:30.864 --> 40:32.264
I got you a jacket.
Do you want to see?

40:32.266 --> 40:33.865
Nicky, we got to stop
spending money.

40:33.867 --> 40:35.734
Just until
Smurf gets out of jail.

40:35.736 --> 40:37.335
So, what,
you don't want toilet paper?

40:37.337 --> 40:38.804
Just go to the store to get it.
It's much cheaper.

40:38.806 --> 40:40.338
Then you don't have to
pay for shipping.

40:40.340 --> 40:42.608
Jesus, J, it's Amazon.
You don't pay for shipping.

40:42.610 --> 40:44.542
Are we seriously
that poor?

40:44.544 --> 40:47.078
Yeah.
We got to act like we are.

40:47.080 --> 40:49.547
Wait. Didn't you pull a job
last night?

40:49.549 --> 40:51.617
What?

40:51.619 --> 40:55.421
Car dealership in L.A.,
guys in motorcycle helmets.

40:57.157 --> 40:58.957
Wait. That wasn't you?

41:02.162 --> 41:05.897
They, uh... wouldn't do that
without you, would they?

41:15.242 --> 41:16.775
You're late.

41:18.378 --> 41:19.745
We're done.

41:21.181 --> 41:24.382
Hi, J.

41:24.384 --> 41:25.717
Can I watch TV?

41:25.719 --> 41:27.853
Of course you can.

41:29.923 --> 41:31.156
Go ahead.

41:34.528 --> 41:36.995
Her dad was shot
in their driveway.

41:36.997 --> 41:39.998
You can show up
once a week for dinner.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.467
Once a week!

41:41.469 --> 41:44.202
I'm sorry.

41:44.204 --> 41:45.337
I forgot.

41:45.339 --> 41:46.805
The house looks like shit.

41:46.807 --> 41:48.674
Well, we had a party last night,
so...

41:48.676 --> 41:50.676
Oh, yeah?

41:52.880 --> 41:55.481
I got to
get back to the bar.

41:55.483 --> 41:58.984
You guys pulled a job?

42:00.688 --> 42:03.922
Motorcycle helmets,
car dealership in L.A.?

42:06.026 --> 42:08.093
What?

42:08.095 --> 42:09.627
You pulled a job?

42:09.629 --> 42:10.696
We're on our own,
right?

42:10.698 --> 42:12.030
We can make
our own decisions...

42:12.032 --> 42:13.631
You pulled a job?
Goddamn it, Deran!

42:13.633 --> 42:15.167
L.A.?
Are you kidding me?

42:15.169 --> 42:16.634
I don't have to
run shit by you.

42:16.636 --> 42:19.171
No, you don't.
Who did you use?

42:19.173 --> 42:21.973
Ox and Colby.
They were solid.

42:21.975 --> 42:23.441
- Bullshit.
- They did fine.

42:23.443 --> 42:26.612
Yeah, they did fine. How many
times did Ox wind up in juvie?

42:28.716 --> 42:30.448
It's the safest
I've ever felt.

42:30.450 --> 42:32.918
I planned the job,
I ran it.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.520
No Craig showing up high.

42:34.522 --> 42:35.854
No Smurf.

42:35.856 --> 42:37.589
No bitch work for Baz.

42:37.591 --> 42:41.193
Until the cops pick up Ox
and lean on him for two seconds.

42:41.195 --> 42:42.794
Okay.
I need the family cut.

42:42.796 --> 42:45.197
You pull a job,
that's fine,

42:45.199 --> 42:46.664
but I take the family cut
from now on.

42:46.666 --> 42:48.266
Wait.
What are you talking about?

42:48.268 --> 42:49.868
What is he talking about?
- The buildings that we own,

42:49.870 --> 42:51.937
they hide your cash...
all of it.

42:51.939 --> 42:53.471
Okay. Well,
I can clean my own money.

42:53.473 --> 42:56.674
Without cash flowing through
those buildings, we lose them.

42:56.676 --> 42:58.009
Everything
that you worked for,

42:58.011 --> 42:59.878
all the apartments,
the houses...

42:59.880 --> 43:02.214
maybe even this place.
- Nah, that's bullshit.

43:02.216 --> 43:04.816
Oh, yeah? You want to
take a look at the books?

43:04.818 --> 43:07.285
If we don't
get some serious cash

43:07.287 --> 43:08.954
running through those accounts
in the next couple of days,

43:08.956 --> 43:10.822
we're gonna start
losing properties.

43:10.824 --> 43:12.824
So sell a building.

43:12.826 --> 43:14.426
That's what the cops
want us to do.

43:14.428 --> 43:15.761
What cops?

43:15.763 --> 43:17.095
The lawyers have said
that the cops

43:17.097 --> 43:19.365
are looking at everything...
Smurf's finances,

43:19.367 --> 43:21.567
her properties, accounts...
everything.

43:21.569 --> 43:22.768
What about the rents?

43:22.770 --> 43:24.302
They're bullshit.

43:24.304 --> 43:25.971
Don't even cover 10%
of what Smurf was running

43:25.973 --> 43:28.440
through the accounts
to launder the money.

43:33.447 --> 43:35.513
Look...

43:35.515 --> 43:37.849
they don't just
want Smurf.

43:37.851 --> 43:42.454
They want you,
they want you...

43:42.456 --> 43:43.789
they want everything.

43:43.791 --> 43:46.324
If we start losing properties,
they're gonna know

43:46.326 --> 43:48.794
that we're using the buildings
to launder the money.

43:48.796 --> 43:50.996
So we need to
pool our cash.

43:50.998 --> 43:54.199
I need everything that Baz gave
you from Smurf's storage unit.

43:54.201 --> 43:56.734
I need it now.

43:56.736 --> 43:58.871
That money's long gone,
man.

44:02.542 --> 44:03.876
I'm out, too.

44:05.212 --> 44:09.014
You spent all that cash
in two months?

44:09.016 --> 44:12.217
Parenting is expensive.

44:12.219 --> 44:14.552
It's our money, J.

44:14.554 --> 44:16.021
We don't answer to you.

44:16.023 --> 44:18.023
Okay.

44:18.025 --> 44:21.226
Then we need to
pull a job.

44:21.228 --> 44:23.295
A hundred grand, at least.
- What are you talking about?

44:23.297 --> 44:24.762
You just said
the cops were watching us.

44:24.764 --> 44:27.699
So we'll have to
be careful.

44:27.701 --> 44:29.835
