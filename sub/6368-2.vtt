03:14.750 --> 03:17.167

- I mean, I'm not pushing for that.

It's okay. You can push a little.

the open deputy position.

03:34.653 --> 03:37.821
I understand that my physical
appearance may be unsettling,

03:37.856 --> 03:41.274

the movement were severed long ago.

- You're a long way from Florida.
- I was born in Banshee.

03:50.786 --> 03:53.287
Just became prudent for
me to distance myself

- from former associates.
- Then why are you back?

03:55.791 --> 03:57.791
It was time to come home, ma'am.

03:57.793 --> 04:00.460
What do your former
associates think about that?

04:00.462 --> 04:04.014
What they think
 is none of my concern.

04:09.972 --> 04:13.056
Sorry, Bunker. Position's filled.

04:13.108 --> 04:16.309
You can hold onto that.
I appreciate your time.

04:58.353 --> 05:00.687
So what was it you
wanted to see me about?

05:00.739 --> 05:04.357
Well, old friend, we need
to clarify our arrangement.

05:04.410 --> 05:05.609
What arrangement is that?

05:05.694 --> 05:07.527
While my factory was
down for three weeks,

05:07.579 --> 05:10.030
you began supplying my
Philadelphia customers.

05:10.032 --> 05:12.416
I understand the impulse.
You saw an opportunity.

05:12.451 --> 05:14.668
But I'm up and running again now,

05:14.703 --> 05:17.287
so we got to go back to
things as they were before.

05:17.339 --> 05:20.457
I stay out of Ohio and you
stay out of Pennsylvania.

05:20.509 --> 05:22.426
You couldn't supply them,
they came to me.

05:22.461 --> 05:25.762
Plain and simple.
Just business.

05:25.798 --> 05:28.131
You fucked up, Proctor.
You don't get to take that back.

05:28.183 --> 05:29.549

- Martin, shut your mouth.
- I got it, Dad.

05:36.892 --> 05:39.559
Yeah, I heard you were
a scary dude back in the day,

05:39.561 --> 05:41.728

- Martin, shut...

- Yeah, we'll make the deal.

08:03.038 --> 08:05.338
Call Sperling back and
tell him that we'll...

08:05.374 --> 08:08.758
- I heard what you said.
- Then why are we still talking about it?

08:08.794 --> 08:10.127
We've got a shot at putting Proctor away

08:10.128 --> 08:11.461

I'll let you know when
I figure it out. Thanks.

Bad enough you got us robbing

What about the unofficial log?

11:39.087 --> 11:41.137
The doctor was here.
He gave her medicine.

11:41.173 --> 11:43.506
She doesn't need a house call.
She needs a hospital.

11:43.558 --> 11:47.010
He will be here again tomorrow.
We will ask him.

11:47.929 --> 11:49.145

Don't.

- No.

night for booty calls.

14:09.070 --> 14:11.454
This isn't about your kids.

We can't do the heist if

He called the Russians redskins

If Proctor gets so much
as a speeding ticket,

we can revoke the plea

No. No, you're not.

37:44.067 --> 37:46.868
[laughs]

37:48.205 --> 37:50.789
- Let's go.
- Oh, one other thing, Sheriff.

37:50.824 --> 37:53.408
- Yeah?
- I call you sheriff as a courtesy,

37:53.460 --> 37:56.661
even though out here
you've got no standing.

37:56.713 --> 37:59.831
The next time you pull some
shit like you did today,

37:59.833 --> 38:02.834
I'm gonna have BIA
crawling all over your ass.

38:02.836 --> 38:06.471
You mind your own backyard
and we'll mind ours.

38:06.506 --> 38:10.341
Billy.
That goes for you, too.

38:17.434 --> 38:20.985
- So Yaz is dirty?
- No.

38:21.021 --> 38:23.405
That would actually require ambition.

38:23.440 --> 38:26.524
Yazzie gave up on that a long time ago.

38:26.576 --> 38:29.444
Between the tribal
council and the Redbones,

38:29.496 --> 38:31.696
he's everyone's bitch.

38:31.748 --> 38:34.833
- What about the girl?
- Aimee? She's the real deal.

38:34.868 --> 38:37.085
She just wants to make a difference.

38:37.120 --> 38:42.540
- She doesn't like you much.
- Yeah, she feels I abandoned her.

38:42.542 --> 38:46.511
She's not wrong.
But I had to get my family out.

38:48.598 --> 38:52.851
- You got kids?
- Yeah, two little girls.

38:52.886 --> 38:56.888
Rachel and Kim.
You?

38:56.940 --> 38:59.274
No. No kids.

39:44.437 --> 39:48.106
- Jenny.
- Mr. Mayor.

39:57.951 --> 40:00.118
<i>Jenny: Living room or bedroom?</i>

40:00.120 --> 40:02.170
<i>Gordon: I think I'm gonna, um...</i>

40:02.205 --> 40:05.123
I'm... I'm really tired. I...

40:05.125 --> 40:09.627
- I bet I can wake you up.
- No, Jenny...

40:09.679 --> 40:12.674
Look, I shouldn't have called you.

40:17.971 --> 40:20.021
For your trouble.

40:22.559 --> 40:24.475
Try again tomorrow?

40:25.946 --> 40:29.781
No, I... I think this is
the end of the road for us.

40:32.953 --> 40:35.870
Well, if you change your mind,

40:35.906 --> 40:38.122
you know where you can find me.

40:59.179 --> 41:01.346
Kitchen's closed, men.

41:01.398 --> 41:04.732
That's all right. We already ate.

41:04.768 --> 41:07.936
I would think after a guy like
you got his ass kicked by a woman,

41:07.988 --> 41:10.489
the last thing he'd want to
do is bring his friends over to

41:10.490 --> 41:12.991
- watch it happen again.
- You got a smart mouth on you, bitch.

41:13.026 --> 41:14.492
So I hear.

41:14.527 --> 41:16.661
I'm gonna shut it for
you tonight permanently.

41:18.865 --> 41:21.199
Listen,

41:21.251 --> 41:23.868
it's been a long day and
I'm all out of repartee.

41:23.870 --> 41:25.453
So if you came here
to fight, quit whining

41:25.505 --> 41:27.672
like a little girl and
get right down to it.

41:27.707 --> 41:29.874
- What's going on here?
- Get lost, Pocahontas.

41:29.926 --> 41:32.260
- Ain't none of your business.
- Normally, I'd agree.

41:32.345 --> 41:33.678
But if you're messing
with the only person

41:33.713 --> 41:35.463
who can serve me some of that apple pie,

41:35.515 --> 41:37.599
then I'm afraid it is my concern.

41:37.634 --> 41:39.384
I'll give you three seconds
to walk your pretty little ass

41:39.436 --> 41:42.470
out that door before I...
[groans]

41:45.058 --> 41:47.275
Don't talk about my ass.

41:48.478 --> 41:50.895
So, how about that pie?

41:50.947 --> 41:53.114
<i>You got it.
[door opens]</i>

42:09.416 --> 42:12.417
- You're Alex Longshadow's sister.
- Nola.

42:12.469 --> 42:14.168
And you're the New York 
mobster's daughter.

42:14.220 --> 42:17.221
Carrie.
Sorry about your brother.

42:17.257 --> 42:19.623
Sorry about your life.

42:20.310 --> 42:22.844
Those are nice. 
What are they, Glocks?

42:22.896 --> 42:24.762
Modified 17Cs.

42:24.814 --> 42:27.682
Cycle at 1,200 rounds per minute.

42:27.734 --> 42:31.903
Mmm, more of a Springfield girl myself.

42:32.772 --> 42:35.106
Different strokes.

42:35.158 --> 42:37.992
That's a great pie.
They bake it here?

42:38.028 --> 42:41.779
I should know the answer to that.
I don't.

42:43.950 --> 42:46.334
I do know where they keep the Scotch.

42:57.213 --> 43:01.766
- Sins of the fathers.
- Amen.

[chuckles]

43:46.346 --> 43:48.963
You shouldn't really be here.

43:52.018 --> 43:55.737
- Don't you have school?
- [scoffs] Yeah.

43:55.772 --> 43:59.407
- Yeah.
- Okay, so then after school?

43:59.442 --> 44:00.575
- I can come by the Cadi.
- No, Deva...

44:00.610 --> 44:02.026
- Don't you want to get to know me?
- Yes.

44:02.078 --> 44:04.695
- Then why won't you?
- Look, I know this is confusing for you,

44:04.748 --> 44:08.866
but Gordon raised you, he loves you,
he's your father.

44:11.704 --> 44:13.788
And what about you?

44:17.177 --> 44:19.544
You told me you stayed
in Banshee because of me.

44:19.596 --> 44:21.462
I had to make sure you're okay.
