10:52.818 --> 10:55.154
You're right,
and I'm glad they took him.

10:55.237 --> 10:57.281
All those owners that
were watching that game,

10:57.365 --> 10:58.991

Do not use that nickname
in this house.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.931
His name is Earvin,

that's what we call him.

11:22.014 --> 11:24.767
That's right!
You heard the woman!
Show some respect!

11:24.850 --> 11:25.976

11:26.060 --> 11:28.104
Mama could scare
Jesus off the cross.

-Ain't he a point guard,
too, Norman?

20:17.382 --> 20:19.176
(sighs) Look.

20:19.259 --> 20:22.471
It's just a meetin'.
He ain't drafted yet.
Calm down.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.598
Oh no, that ain't what I heard.

20:24.681 --> 20:28.518
Everybody in D-Town
saying it's a done deal.

20:28.602 --> 20:32.189
Got to be an advantage being
a guard as tall as he is.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.607
Yeah...

20:33.690 --> 20:36.276
When you first came in here,
we thought you was the mailman.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.945
(laughter)

20:38.028 --> 20:39.905
-Gave you a stamp
and everything!
-(mocking laughter)

20:39.988 --> 20:42.491
-Kiss my Black ass, Sharice.
-Oh!

20:42.574 --> 20:46.119
Listen, y'all don't know shit
about the game of basketball,
Athena.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.622
Look, they can draft him
if they want to.

20:48.705 --> 20:49.998
I'll just run him
off the floor.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.459
Aw. Don't worry, Norman.
If you lose your minutes,

20:52.542 --> 20:54.836
maybe Magic can pull your
little ass out of a hat.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.713
(laughter)

20:56.797 --> 20:58.131
Athena:
I'm surprised Kareem--

20:58.215 --> 21:01.510
Hey!
It's my motherfuckin'
team, goddammit!

21:02.511 --> 21:04.137
Sharice:
Ooh... Okay.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.263
It's my fuckin' team!

21:05.347 --> 21:07.933
(customers laughter)

21:09.434 --> 21:10.686
(clack)

21:10.769 --> 21:12.729
Assistant Director:
Alright, we're set, boss.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.481
Director: And action.

21:14.564 --> 21:16.608
Wait a minute,
I know you.

21:16.692 --> 21:18.443
You're Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.570
You play center for
the Los Angeles Lakers.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.531
I'm sorry, son,

21:22.614 --> 21:25.283
but you must have me confused
with someone else.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.911
My name is Roger Murdock.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.538
I'm the copilot.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.831
You are Kareem.

21:30.914 --> 21:34.876
I've seen you play.
My dad's got season tickets.

21:34.960 --> 21:36.920
I think you're the greatest,
but my dad says

21:37.004 --> 21:40.007
you don't work
hard enough on defense.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.843
And you don't really try
except during playoffs.

21:42.926 --> 21:44.970
(stilted):
The hell I don't!

21:45.053 --> 21:46.972
Listen, kid, I've been
hearing that crap

21:47.055 --> 21:48.932
ever since I was at UCLA.

21:49.016 --> 21:51.351
I'm out here busting
my buns every night.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.228
You tell your old man
to drag Walton and Lanier

21:53.311 --> 21:55.480
up and down the court
for 48 minutes.

21:55.564 --> 21:57.024
Director:
Cut!

21:57.107 --> 21:58.358
(overlapping chatter)

21:58.442 --> 22:00.610
Why not--
was OJ not available?

22:03.947 --> 22:05.282
So, how was I?

22:05.365 --> 22:07.951
You were great, babe.
Really killer.

22:09.286 --> 22:11.371
I'm trying to do
what you told me to.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.498
Trying to project
my inner warmth.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.667
Mr. Abdul-Jabbar?

22:15.751 --> 22:18.462
You really are
my favorite player.

22:18.545 --> 22:21.298
Do you think maybe
we could take a picture?

22:22.049 --> 22:23.508
Fuck off, kid.

22:23.592 --> 22:25.093
(muttering):
It's my motherfuckin' team.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.678
It's my motherfuckin' team.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.263
Everybody talkin'
about "Magic, Magic."

22:28.346 --> 22:30.474
Why is this nigga so magical?

22:31.850 --> 22:33.727
Cap! Ca--

22:35.020 --> 22:37.981
-Cap!

22:38.065 --> 22:40.192

I'm about to tell you,

22:58.794 --> 23:01.088
-don't you, Norman?
-(jazz on headphones)

23:01.171 --> 23:02.464
Fuck off?

23:02.547 --> 23:05.133
-Please.
-But, cap, I'm just t--

Okay. Alright.
You look great, Cheryl.

Cheryl:
Thank you, Norman.

This way, son.

24:06.027 --> 24:08.113
You know what they say
about thoroughbreds?

24:08.196 --> 24:09.948
You can judge one
by its appetite.

24:14.369 --> 24:16.746
I hope you brought yours, son.

Yes, sir.
Saturdays and Sundays.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.816
Weekdays, I'm on
the Chrysler line.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.943
Cooke:
Chrysler? (laughs)

24:47.027 --> 24:49.863
Small world. You'll get
a chuckle out of this.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.574
Buss here is selling me
the Chrysler Building.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.702
(quiet laughter)

24:56.494 --> 24:57.537
Hmm.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.500
I worked a mill line
in Wyoming.

25:01.583 --> 25:03.418
Never ate so good
or slept so well,

25:03.501 --> 25:05.420
-I'll tell you that.
-I know that's right.

25:05.503 --> 25:08.173
Buss.
Yeah. That hard work,
it'll put you to sleep, huh?

25:08.256 --> 25:10.634
-Not built for everybody.
-Jerry Buss: Mm.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.890
What's the matter, son?
You haven't touched your food.

25:17.599 --> 25:20.143
Um... (laughs)

25:20.227 --> 25:22.103
I was wondering, like...

25:22.187 --> 25:24.439
-what is it?
-(Jerry laughs)

25:25.273 --> 25:26.358
Sand dabs.

25:26.441 --> 25:28.735
-Okay.
-Cooke: Th-they're sand dabs.

25:28.818 --> 25:31.363
It's expensive is what it is.
It's a very fine fish.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.657
A delicacy.
Take my word for it.

25:34.241 --> 25:35.617
Right.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.995
Could I just get a cheeseburger?

Earvin. Earvin.

25:41.331 --> 25:44.584
Come on, Jack.
The kid's 19.
Get him a burger.

25:44.668 --> 25:46.294
You want one, too,
Mr. Johnson?

25:46.378 --> 25:48.630
-I'm alright.
-Tony?

25:48.713 --> 25:50.298
Can you please
get me a burger,

25:50.382 --> 25:52.133
get this man a burger,
and get this young man

25:52.217 --> 25:54.135
right here a burger,
with cheese and all that?

25:54.219 --> 25:55.971
-Yeah, everything.
-Alright. Everything, the works.

25:56.054 --> 25:57.973
Whatever you got.
You want one, Jack?

25:58.056 --> 25:59.891
No, I'm enjoying my sand dab.

25:59.975 --> 26:02.686
Okay, good. Good.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.938
Thank you, Tony.
(clears throat)

26:05.021 --> 26:06.898
(cutlery clinking)

26:10.902 --> 26:12.279
You should be aware,
young man,

26:12.362 --> 26:15.532
that we haven't settled
on a pick yet.

26:15.615 --> 26:18.451
That's cool. I haven't
settled on a team yet.

26:18.535 --> 26:23.123
But, he's not opposed
to a fair offer either.
Are you, son?

26:23.206 --> 26:25.834
This is a draft,
not free agency.

26:25.917 --> 26:28.086
Choice is ours.
He goes where he's told.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.756
Or I go back to school,

26:31.840 --> 26:34.175
turn pro next year
for a different team.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.635
Huh.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.679
I'm thinkin' 600,000.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.767
(Jerry chuckling)

26:42.851 --> 26:46.855
Look here, son.
Lew Alcindor is
the league's biggest star.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.816
-Kareem.
-Cooke: Same difference.

26:49.899 --> 26:52.986
He's also one surly
son of a bitch negotiator,

26:53.069 --> 26:56.114
and we closed at 650.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.908
That's why six feels cool.

26:58.992 --> 27:00.869
I mean, for now.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.954
Plus tuition in
the summertime,

27:03.038 --> 27:05.749
so I can finish my degree,
and, you know, make Mama happy.

27:05.832 --> 27:08.585
Jerry Buss:
That's important. (laughs)

27:08.668 --> 27:10.628
-Don't underestimate mom.
-Four.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.922
And you can work your way
through school, young man,

27:13.006 --> 27:14.382
just like I did.

27:15.383 --> 27:17.427
Way I see it, Mr. Cooke,

27:17.510 --> 27:19.220
basketball is my work.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.057
And I'm worth six.

27:23.641 --> 27:25.185
This dab ain't half bad.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.771
Look here, boy.

27:27.854 --> 27:29.022
Jerry Buss:
Ah...

27:30.357 --> 27:33.276
-400,000's our final offer.
-(Jerry coughs)

27:36.780 --> 27:38.656
-(laughs)
-(Jerry coughs)

27:38.740 --> 27:41.618
Mr. Cooke, do what
you want with your money.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.745
Hey, Pop, let's go
see some movie stars.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.121
Alright, boys!

27:45.205 --> 27:47.207
We're all boys here,
right? (clears throat)

27:47.290 --> 27:48.792
We're gonna
think it over.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.877
I-I'll walk you
fellows out, alright?

27:50.960 --> 27:53.088
That alright, Jack?
It was a good lunch.

27:53.171 --> 27:55.965
I enjoyed that salad,
I'll tell you.

27:56.049 --> 27:59.094
Johnson Sr.:
We don't all get the world
right out the gate, son.

28:00.762 --> 28:02.806
More money than I've seen
in my entire life.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.432
That's what they're giving you,
and you say no?

28:04.516 --> 28:06.267
...really thrilled,
especially my husband.

28:07.310 --> 28:09.396
Look where we at, Pop.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.065
We in this fancy-ass hotel.

28:12.148 --> 28:14.401
They fly us out first class.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.486
They do all that shit
to get you primed up,

28:16.569 --> 28:19.280
so you jump at the first offer
they put in front of your face.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.158
Earvin, pull your head
out your ass.

28:23.993 --> 28:27.080
All I know is you got 400,000

28:27.163 --> 28:30.583
in the one hand,
nothing in the other.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.420
-Pretty simple choice to me.
-That's you, Pop.

28:34.796 --> 28:38.133
When I first got to Everett
with all them white kids,

28:38.216 --> 28:40.468
I was scared as hell.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.304
I could've looked down
and kept it moving,

28:43.388 --> 28:45.306
but I didn't.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.267
I looked them right in the eyes,

28:47.350 --> 28:51.062
gave them a smile
and a State Championship.

28:51.146 --> 28:52.689
(laughs)

28:52.772 --> 28:55.900
And now, they love
them some Magic.

28:55.984 --> 29:00.071
Just figured out a different
way to deal with them is all.

29:00.155 --> 29:03.241
I learned how to
make 'em feel good.

29:03.324 --> 29:04.784
You figure 'em out
just like that?

29:04.868 --> 29:08.413
(laughs) You can have pretty
much anything you want.

29:08.496 --> 29:11.791
You know how many
times I went left when
I should've gone right?

29:13.001 --> 29:14.419
Hm?

29:14.502 --> 29:17.839
Smiled when there
was nothing funny?

29:19.090 --> 29:21.676
Took less than I deserved,

29:21.759 --> 29:23.344
but bowed my head and said,

29:23.428 --> 29:26.139
"Thank you, sir,"

29:26.222 --> 29:29.017
so you could keep your
mind on playing ball?

29:29.100 --> 29:31.811
-Pop...
-And for all that,

29:31.895 --> 29:34.898
I get you... telling me...

29:34.981 --> 29:37.775
you know something
about this life I don't?

29:40.612 --> 29:41.738
Pop!

29:44.741 --> 29:46.951
(phone ringing)

29:48.369 --> 29:49.370
Hello?

29:49.454 --> 29:51.456
(applause on TV)

29:51.539 --> 29:53.416
Hey, Dr. Buss, what's up?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.793
West:
I mean, Moncrief's
my fuckin' guy.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.713
No, Mon-Moncrief is
100% my fuckin' guy.

29:58.796 --> 30:00.215

30:00.298 --> 30:02.717

30:02.800 --> 30:04.594
He really posted
the same numbers.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.970
Scotch and soda.

30:06.054 --> 30:07.931

by Perry Como playing)

30:08.014 --> 30:09.641
What you got there, Jer?

30:10.475 --> 30:12.101
Pictures of your sister.

30:13.686 --> 30:16.689

drafting Magic.

doctor are you anyway?

30:27.575 --> 30:30.161
Physical chemistry.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.038
-Hm.
-Believe it or not,

30:32.121 --> 30:34.415
I used to help design
missiles for the government.

30:35.875 --> 30:37.418
But one day,
I realized

30:37.502 --> 30:40.088
I'd rather build things
than blow 'em up.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.131
That was
the end of that.

30:42.215 --> 30:43.299

Earvin, that's what
I wanna do with the Lakers.

30:46.928 --> 30:49.389

something special.

30:49.472 --> 30:50.765
