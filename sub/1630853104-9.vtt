WEBVTT

00:02.219 --> 00:04.221
Previously onHalo...

00:04.265 --> 00:06.528
They will not stop
until they have both stones.

00:06.571 --> 00:07.964
Do you know where
they took the other one?

00:08.008 --> 00:12.360
I know in the star system
you call Aspero.

00:12.403 --> 00:13.970
Aspero star system.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.755
Find me a planet that can
support Covenant life!

00:16.799 --> 00:19.497
We found absolutely nothing.

00:19.541 --> 00:20.890
Makee can show us
where they are.

00:20.933 --> 00:22.674
So they trust me.

00:22.718 --> 00:25.199
They trust me,
and I trust you.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.071
This obsession has cost you

00:28.115 --> 00:30.508
every relationship
that you have today.

00:30.552 --> 00:31.596
What else are you willing
to sacrifice?

00:31.640 --> 00:33.033
Everything!

00:33.076 --> 00:34.817
Parangosky wants you
off the planet.

00:34.860 --> 00:37.950
Everything she told us
was a lie.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.866
Did you tell Riz and Vannak?

00:40.910 --> 00:42.999
Not yet.

00:43.043 --> 00:45.871
My orders shall supersede
any others.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.874
Bring John, the prisoner,
and the artifact to my ship.

00:48.918 --> 00:51.877
Once we have Makee,
we'll no longer need John

00:51.921 --> 00:53.879
to activate the artifacts.

00:53.923 --> 00:58.232
You and John combined will be
the best of all of us.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.277
Stop!
You're walking into a trap.

01:01.365 --> 01:03.150
Cortana!

01:03.193 --> 01:04.194
Go!

01:09.243 --> 01:10.809
It was her voice
on the recording from Gladius.

01:10.853 --> 01:12.898
-I had no choice.

01:12.942 --> 01:15.249
No, no, please!

01:15.292 --> 01:16.641
You will pay for this.

01:25.607 --> 01:27.435
Goodbye, John.

02:26.798 --> 02:27.712
Kai?

02:30.498 --> 02:33.457
Chief, I'm okay.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.763
Go.

02:50.082 --> 02:52.998
Makee, she--
she took the artifact.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.696
She's gone.

03:05.533 --> 03:06.490
What are you doing?

03:11.278 --> 03:13.454
Take your weapon off!

03:13.497 --> 03:15.456
Drop it.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.500
Where's the Covenant ship?

03:16.544 --> 03:18.459
Impound hangar
Delta 7.

03:18.502 --> 03:19.547
Take me there.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.120
Chief.

03:28.164 --> 03:29.948
Halsey's orders
are to bring you in

03:29.992 --> 03:31.907
dead or alive.
Your choice.

03:33.517 --> 03:35.519
She kidnapped us,
Vannak.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.520
What are you
talking about?

03:36.564 --> 03:39.480
All of us. We were kids.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.525
She took us from our families.

03:44.311 --> 03:47.052
It's true.
Halsey lied to us.

03:47.096 --> 03:50.186
She's been lying to us
for our entire lives.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.622
I don't understand.

03:51.666 --> 03:53.711
She doesn't want you
to understand.

03:53.755 --> 03:55.539
She just wants to control you.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.456
Raise your weapon, Riz.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.153
She kidnapped us!

04:02.546 --> 04:06.507
She tortured
and brainwashed us...

04:06.550 --> 04:09.466
-turned us into weapons.
-It's not true.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.468
Now she's turning us
against each other.

04:11.512 --> 04:13.383
-Vannak, listen--
-It's not true!

04:13.427 --> 04:14.384
It is!

04:15.516 --> 04:17.518
It's all true.

04:18.736 --> 04:19.650
I was there.

04:23.524 --> 04:27.049
I helped Halsey select you.

04:27.092 --> 04:30.487
I planned your abductions.

04:30.531 --> 04:34.926
Delivered your replacement
clones to your families.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.842
Worked with her
to erase your memories.

04:46.938 --> 04:49.506
If there's anyone
you should shoot, it's me.

04:58.123 --> 05:02.084
We lose the artifact,
we lose the war.

05:02.127 --> 05:04.129
It's that simple.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.003
No matter what
they've done to us...

05:10.310 --> 05:12.312
we're all we have now.

05:21.495 --> 05:22.539
It's just us.

05:33.550 --> 05:37.337
The Covenant ship
is in hangar Delta 7.

05:37.380 --> 05:39.295
Makee's probably
headed there.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.211
Chief...

05:44.692 --> 05:46.563
...you three go.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.173
I want Halsey.

05:52.830 --> 05:53.831
Miranda.

06:03.450 --> 06:04.668
Out of the ship, Dr. Halsey!

06:04.712 --> 06:06.627
This is your last warning!

06:06.670 --> 06:08.629
Shut down your engines
and come out,

06:08.672 --> 06:10.631
or we will fire upon you!

06:12.720 --> 06:14.635
Auxiliary power is up.
It's up.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.637
AI navigation is working.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.640
We need to take off before they
can energize their EMP cannons.

06:19.683 --> 06:20.641
Did you get a reading?

06:20.684 --> 06:21.642
What?

06:21.685 --> 06:23.295
Did you get a reading?

06:23.339 --> 06:24.819
Someone touched
the artifact.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.647
No. It blew everything out.

06:26.690 --> 06:28.562
-Shit.
-Look, Doctor, come on.

06:28.605 --> 06:29.954
We need to leave now,
all right?

06:29.998 --> 06:31.652
Not until I know
what's happening.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.654
Yes, yes, but they're going
to arrest you.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.612
-No--
-Yes, they'll arrest you.

06:36.700 --> 06:38.223
The package is secure.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.051
Aren't you listening
to me?

06:40.095 --> 06:41.705
We still have options.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.277
Covenant Phantom on the move!

07:00.985 --> 07:03.814
Get a track
on that Covenant ship.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.207
And put some Pelicans
in the air.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.904
Yes, sir.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.384
Halsey's ship
just came back online.

07:08.428 --> 07:09.516
It's preparing to launch.

07:16.348 --> 07:17.349
No!

07:19.395 --> 07:20.440
After it!

07:31.320 --> 07:32.887
We're hit!

07:54.691 --> 07:56.650
What's my real name?

07:56.693 --> 07:59.217
Kai, you are not
thinking clearly.

07:59.261 --> 08:01.785
-This ship is about to crash.
-Tell me my name.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.744
Let's turn this around.
We can even get into the pod.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.267
-We can discuss--
-Enough!

08:08.575 --> 08:10.098
Who am I?

08:13.754 --> 08:16.191
You are exactly
who you're meant to be.

08:17.279 --> 08:19.324
-Ah!

08:21.239 --> 08:23.938
hull integrity compromised.

08:23.981 --> 08:26.288
-Kai...
-All personnel to escape pods.

08:49.616 --> 08:51.400
Ah!

08:51.443 --> 08:52.836
Escape pod deploying.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.359
No!

08:57.232 --> 08:59.147
Halsey's broken off
into the escape pod.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.590
Track that escape pod.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.853
Do not let her
leave Reach airspace.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.289
EMP ready?

09:11.333 --> 09:12.464
Almost rebooted, sir.

09:16.991 --> 09:18.906
Kai, what's your status?

09:25.042 --> 09:26.522
Kai?

09:26.566 --> 09:29.743
Attempting to regain control
of the ship.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.919
Hull integrity is compromised.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.925
Shit.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.753
1-2-5, do you copy?

09:53.331 --> 09:56.291
1-2-5, this is Captain Keyes.
Do you copy?

09:57.379 --> 09:58.293
Kai!

10:33.850 --> 10:35.635
Cortana?

10:35.678 --> 10:38.289
Yes, Chief.
I'm still with you.

10:38.333 --> 10:39.639
I'm gonna need you now.

11:54.322 --> 11:56.759
You'll pay for this.

11:56.803 --> 12:00.197
-No!

12:00.241 --> 12:02.199
Halsey
guards her secrets

12:02.243 --> 12:04.114
in a handwritten journal
which never leaves her side.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.073
And what about Makee?

12:06.116 --> 12:08.292
Were she and Halsey working
together from the beginning?

12:08.336 --> 12:10.294
No. Once she learned--

12:10.338 --> 12:13.254
Cortana, did Halsey ask Makee
to help her steal the artifact?

12:13.297 --> 12:15.299
Yes. But Makee refused.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.301
She wanted it for herself.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.303
I'm not certain that's--

12:19.347 --> 12:21.262
Bring up the Aspero star system.

12:21.305 --> 12:22.872
Twenty times magnification.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.308
Chief, we've searched
every visible region

12:24.352 --> 12:25.875
of the Aspero system.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.877
We can't find
one habitable planet.

12:27.921 --> 12:29.879
Makee told me they
brought the Eridanus artifact

12:29.923 --> 12:31.272
to their holy place,

12:31.315 --> 12:32.926
somewhere in Aspero.

12:32.969 --> 12:35.276
How could you trust
a single thing she told you

12:35.319 --> 12:37.017
after all she's done?

12:37.060 --> 12:39.280
She was honest with me.

12:39.323 --> 12:41.282
At least for a little while.

12:41.325 --> 12:42.979
I could feel it.

12:43.023 --> 12:44.502
I believe
Master Chief is right.

12:44.546 --> 12:48.289
Oh? And did you
feel it as well?

12:48.332 --> 12:50.813
In my own way,
yes, ma'am.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.336
Covenant prophecy.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.340
The Halo is meant to be
revealed

12:56.384 --> 12:58.299
where the stars sparkle
like glass.

12:58.342 --> 13:01.128
A tad poetic for the Covenant,
don't you think?

13:01.171 --> 13:02.172
I don't think
it's poetic at all.

13:02.216 --> 13:03.478
I think it's a clue.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.306
Cortana, what's the system's

13:05.349 --> 13:07.264
gravitational
field strength?

13:07.308 --> 13:08.657
Interesting question.

13:08.700 --> 13:10.833
There are several fields.

13:10.877 --> 13:14.271
Aspero is an unstable system,
surrounded by an artificial

13:14.315 --> 13:17.274
dynamical network of what
appear to be cosmic strings.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.363
Gravitational lensing
from the strings

13:19.407 --> 13:22.279
warps and scatters the light
coming from within the system,

13:22.323 --> 13:24.281
creating
a kaleidoscopic effect.

13:24.325 --> 13:25.979
From our point of view,

13:26.022 --> 13:28.285
a planet would appear
more like fragments.

13:28.329 --> 13:31.288
Or shards of glass.

13:31.332 --> 13:33.247
So you're saying
the Covenant planet

13:33.290 --> 13:35.771
could be right there,
we just can't see it.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.425
Not until we're actually there.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.297
I'll send the Marines.

13:40.341 --> 13:42.299
Twelve battalions.

13:42.343 --> 13:45.259
Admiral,
you send 10,000 Marines,

13:45.302 --> 13:47.174
you lose 10,000 Marines.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.698
We are talking about
humankind's first incursion

13:49.741 --> 13:53.006
into Covenant-controlled space.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.224
We can do it, ma'am.

13:55.312 --> 13:56.705
Silver Team can do it.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.448
Listen to me.

14:00.491 --> 14:04.278
Your recent behavior has been
erratic, to say the least.

14:04.321 --> 14:07.020
You haven't been
your usual self.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.283
Whatever emotions
you're experiencing,

14:09.326 --> 14:11.285
whatever pain you must feel,

14:11.328 --> 14:13.287
just put it aside.

14:13.330 --> 14:15.332
Forget everything.
Do you understand?

14:18.901 --> 14:21.251
When you walk
into the battlefield,

14:21.295 --> 14:23.601
John must no longer exist.

14:24.689 --> 14:26.343
Only the Master Chief.

14:36.571 --> 14:37.485
Chief.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.881
We pulsed Halsey's
escape pod over Manassas.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.971
We'll have her
back in custody shortly.

14:47.321 --> 14:51.151
There is a lot that has
happened over the years.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.762
A lot that I am not
proud of.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.331
I've tried to rationalize it...

14:59.333 --> 15:01.509
because of all the good
that you have done.

15:04.338 --> 15:07.341
There's no apology that can give
you back what we took from you.

15:13.303 --> 15:14.826
But if--

15:14.870 --> 15:16.306
There will be reckoning,
Captain.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.658
Someday. For all of us.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.313
Not today.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.775
Hey, were you really
gonna shoot me?

15:50.819 --> 15:52.777
-You know I would have.
-Oh, absolutely. No question.

15:52.821 --> 15:56.738
Jesus. I can't believe you two.
You're, like, ice-cold.

15:56.781 --> 15:59.697
Well, weren't you gonna
shoot us?

15:59.741 --> 16:01.525
Of course I would have. I would
have just felt bad about it.

16:01.569 --> 16:04.311
-Mm-hmm.
-Damn, Vannak.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.740
-Dr. Halsey!
-Oh, shit.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.655
She's moving!

16:44.699 --> 16:45.743
-Stop!

16:45.787 --> 16:47.789
We got her!

17:10.812 --> 17:12.727
She said anything yet?

17:12.770 --> 17:13.815
Not a word.

17:15.817 --> 17:19.255
Miranda, we need to talk.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.649
If you could just give me
a moment of your time--

17:21.692 --> 17:22.824
Miranda.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.922
Chief, there's
something I need to tell you.

19:00.965 --> 19:04.360
After the other Spartans
took you into custody,

19:04.404 --> 19:08.408
Dr. Halsey was going to give me
full control of your body...

19:08.451 --> 19:09.365
and your mind.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.458
And how was she planning
on achieving that?

19:15.502 --> 19:17.286
You would need
to cease to exist,

19:17.330 --> 19:19.636
and I would take over.

19:22.813 --> 19:24.728
-I see.
-It was always the plan.

19:24.772 --> 19:26.730
It's what I was designed to do.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.732
Why didn't you just take
me over from the beginning?

19:28.776 --> 19:31.779
Only you could activate
the artifacts.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.738
Halsey needed me
to find the Halo.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.218
Yes.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.743
Once Makee showed up,
I became redundant?

19:40.831 --> 19:42.311
Yes.

19:53.975 --> 19:55.759
Well, you had your chance.

19:55.803 --> 19:57.718
You could have knocked me out,
handed me over to Halsey.

19:58.806 --> 20:00.329
Why didn't you?

20:00.373 --> 20:02.375
Because I was also designed
to learn, John.

20:02.418 --> 20:05.726
And I have. From you.

20:05.769 --> 20:07.728
I believe that
what Dr. Halsey wants

20:07.771 --> 20:09.338
to eliminate from your species

20:09.382 --> 20:12.733
is precisely the thing
that makes you special--

20:12.776 --> 20:14.082
your humanity.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.737
I've watched you
fight for yours,

20:16.780 --> 20:18.782
and I believe it's a cause
that's right.

20:20.784 --> 20:22.743
So you no longer
want to take over my body?

20:22.786 --> 20:25.789
I'll wait for the less
beaten-up version.

20:32.100 --> 20:33.841
The entire starfield
just disappeared.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.277
We've entered the seam

20:35.321 --> 20:37.236
between competing
gravitational fields.

20:37.279 --> 20:39.194
It scatters
all available light.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.764
You'll need to steer
along the critical point

20:43.807 --> 20:45.548
between cosmic string segments,

20:45.592 --> 20:46.984
where the fields
are at equilibrium.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.731
Electrical systems failing.

20:54.775 --> 20:56.733
Chief, rerouting
from auxiliary power.

20:56.777 --> 20:57.995
Vannak!

20:58.039 --> 20:59.780
Chief.

21:03.087 --> 21:04.959
-My instruments are down.

21:05.002 --> 21:06.743
-Cortana?
-Calculating a path now.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.745
You must maintain
the precise line.

21:08.789 --> 21:10.747
If you veer too far
in the wrong direction,

21:10.791 --> 21:12.749
the ship will be spaghettified
by tidal forces.

21:12.793 --> 21:14.447
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Spaghettified?

21:14.490 --> 21:16.405
Stretched. Twisted.
Torn apart.

21:16.449 --> 21:19.234
Right, and you didn't think I
should know this before we left?

21:19.278 --> 21:20.975
Our odds for success
were already so low,

21:21.018 --> 21:22.846
I didn't want to worry you.

21:22.890 --> 21:25.414
-We're flying blind.
-I'll be your eyes.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.679
Fire in Cabin 3!

21:36.382 --> 21:39.080
-Left two degrees.

21:39.123 --> 21:40.386
I don't like this, Chief.

21:51.484 --> 21:53.747
We've lost artificial gravity!

21:53.790 --> 21:57.098
The hull is being pulled apart!

21:57.141 --> 22:00.797
hull integrity compromised.

22:00.841 --> 22:02.364
We're going too fast.

22:04.627 --> 22:05.933
Come again?
I can't hear you!

22:07.413 --> 22:10.067
-...navigation system.
-Shit!

22:17.423 --> 22:19.381
I don't like this
one bit!

22:19.425 --> 22:20.339
Hold on!

22:42.578 --> 22:43.797
Hold this line.

22:43.840 --> 22:46.190
-How do you know?
-Just do it!

22:46.234 --> 22:48.367
Ship won't hold!

22:48.410 --> 22:49.411
She'll hold.

23:31.975 --> 23:33.934
Oh, good, you're still alive.

23:33.977 --> 23:36.763
And I think we've found
what we're looking for.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.970
Surprised to see me?

24:16.150 --> 24:18.108
You know, I never thought
I'd see the day

24:18.152 --> 24:20.110
when the great Catherine Halsey

24:20.154 --> 24:22.156
got held accountable
for her actions.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.639
You've rung up
quite a list of charges.

24:26.682 --> 24:28.815
I can read them for you
if you'd like.

24:28.858 --> 24:31.121
It starts with kidnapping
and ends with treason.

24:35.125 --> 24:37.563
No? I don't blame you.

24:37.606 --> 24:40.087
The committee would rather not
discuss it either.

24:40.130 --> 24:43.090
They're quite embarrassed
by the whole affair.

24:43.133 --> 24:45.440
Which is why they impaneled
a military tribunal

24:45.484 --> 24:47.007
to try your case
in private.

24:48.399 --> 24:50.227
They've already
reached a verdict.

24:51.359 --> 24:54.405
Would you like to hear it?

24:54.449 --> 24:57.104
Well, your guilt was never
really in question, was it?

24:57.147 --> 24:59.149
The real debate
was over your punishment.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.240
"In spite of her substantial
contributions

25:03.284 --> 25:06.243
to the war effort,
the committee is convinced

25:06.287 --> 25:09.899
that she is too dangerous
for incarceration or exile."

25:12.119 --> 25:14.121
Imagine that.

25:17.124 --> 25:19.126
Which left them
only one option.

25:22.129 --> 25:24.131
Article 72.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.484
I wanted you
to hear it from me.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.012
You know...

25:38.145 --> 25:41.104
I thought by keeping you away
from all of this,

25:41.148 --> 25:43.150
I was protecting you.

25:46.109 --> 25:50.113
But, uh, it's had
the opposite effect.

25:50.157 --> 25:51.550
It's hardened you.

25:55.118 --> 26:00.123
Miranda,
you are chasing a ghost.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.213
Let it go.

26:05.259 --> 26:08.131
Let it go for your own sake.

26:14.137 --> 26:15.182
Goodbye, Mother.

27:38.700 --> 27:40.223
I'm picking up low-level
Covenant activity

27:40.267 --> 27:42.225
in the northwest hemisphere.

27:42.269 --> 27:44.227
Locking in for orbital drop.

27:44.271 --> 27:46.229
Air and ground defenses?

27:46.273 --> 27:48.188
I'm not reading any.

27:48.231 --> 27:50.843
That's odd. I thought this was
their holy planet.

27:50.886 --> 27:53.193
Well, why defend a planet
a human can't find?

27:53.236 --> 27:56.196
Stay alert. We go in quiet,
get the package, we get out.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.241
-Roger that.
-Aye aye, Chief.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.159
Just the artifacts.

28:03.203 --> 28:04.726
That's the mission,
right, Chief?

28:04.770 --> 28:06.249
-He's talking about Makee.
-Thank you, Kai.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.210
You have your orders.

28:10.253 --> 28:11.211
Aye, Chief.

28:11.254 --> 28:13.256
You heard him.

28:15.258 --> 28:18.261
Silver Team, on me.

28:40.283 --> 28:41.894
Afternoon.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.902
No one will remember you.

28:49.945 --> 28:51.642
Kai, overwatch.

28:51.686 --> 28:53.427
Copy.

29:00.956 --> 29:02.958
Yeah. Come to Daddy.

29:14.230 --> 29:17.320
Security is light.
Where is everyone?

29:17.364 --> 29:19.061
The only enemy activity

29:19.105 --> 29:21.585
I'm picking up now
is inside that temple.

29:21.629 --> 29:22.630
Let's move.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.548
Dr. Halsey, stay with me.

29:27.591 --> 29:29.942
-Let her through!

29:29.985 --> 29:31.595
Doctor, look at me.

29:31.639 --> 29:32.814
-Stay with me.
-Hold her arm.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.511
What happened?
What happened?

29:34.555 --> 29:35.904
The guard said her nose
started bleeding again,

29:35.948 --> 29:37.384
and she just started seizing.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.908
Dr. Halsey,
we're going to help you.

29:39.952 --> 29:41.475
Seizure disorder.

29:41.518 --> 29:42.998
That thing
you replaced me with?

29:43.042 --> 29:45.087
Genetically compromised
flash clone,

29:45.131 --> 29:46.610
after which,
for a period of time,

29:46.654 --> 29:47.873
they will cause nosebleeds,
headaches,

29:47.916 --> 29:49.309
undiagnosed seizure disorder,

29:49.352 --> 29:52.355
which was a reasonable
explanation.

29:52.399 --> 29:54.662
-She's going critical!
-Stop.

29:54.705 --> 29:56.142
Stop what you're doing!
Where is she?

29:56.185 --> 29:57.534
She's critical, ma'am.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.058
Where is she? Where is she?

29:59.101 --> 30:00.581
-Dr. Keyes!
-Tell me where she is!

30:00.624 --> 30:02.452
-Ma'am!
-Stop! Tell me where she is!

30:02.496 --> 30:04.193
Where is she?
Where is she?

30:04.237 --> 30:06.195
Miranda, calm down.
Let them look after your mother.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.502
That's--
That's not my mother.

31:12.174 --> 31:13.132
Chief!

31:14.220 --> 31:15.482
We've been compromised.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.189
Chief, take cover.

31:27.233 --> 31:28.451
Go, go!

31:37.504 --> 31:39.288
What the hell is that?

31:39.332 --> 31:41.595
Sangheili warriors
approaching from below.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.597
I thought you said
this place was clear.

31:43.640 --> 31:45.599
They must have been hidden
inside the mountain itself.

31:45.642 --> 31:47.209
-I couldn't detect them.
-How many?

31:47.253 --> 31:50.082
Calculating.
One, two, two-fifty...

31:50.125 --> 31:51.692
-Chief, how many?
-Hundreds.

31:51.735 --> 31:53.389
But they're coming in waves.

31:53.433 --> 31:55.783
-We need to move. Now!
-How many?

32:00.005 --> 32:01.745
They're coming
over the ledge on three sides.

32:01.789 --> 32:03.530
-I got the leaders.
-There's too many!

32:03.573 --> 32:05.445
-Just a few hundred.
-You gotta be shitting me.

32:05.488 --> 32:06.837
-Riz, with me.

32:06.881 --> 32:08.622
Kai, Vannak, on the six.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.950
-Chief?
-What?

32:31.993 --> 32:33.342
Remember him?

32:34.430 --> 32:36.128
Well, shit.

32:36.171 --> 32:38.130
-I've got this!
-Riz, no!

33:18.866 --> 33:20.302
Chief, no!

33:40.235 --> 33:42.063
Chief's down!

33:50.419 --> 33:51.420
Makee.

33:52.813 --> 33:55.859
Makee, no!

34:28.109 --> 34:29.850
Are you seeing this?

34:34.942 --> 34:36.378
John.

34:44.821 --> 34:45.909
John!

34:48.651 --> 34:51.437
John! John!

35:06.974 --> 35:08.062
You made it.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.676
Wow, Makee.

35:18.290 --> 35:19.595
It's beautiful, isn't it?

35:30.302 --> 35:32.391
Riz, I've got you!

35:40.312 --> 35:42.009
Chief! Dammit!

35:45.621 --> 35:47.319
Makee, send us back.

35:51.714 --> 35:53.760
I'm not going back, John.

35:57.894 --> 36:00.070
Kai, we need Chief
back in the fight.

36:00.114 --> 36:02.508
He's unresponsive, what do you
want me to do about it?

36:02.551 --> 36:04.162
Wake him up!

36:04.205 --> 36:06.773
Chief! Chief! Get up!

36:06.816 --> 36:08.383
Chief!

36:11.343 --> 36:12.779
Vannak, get down!

36:12.822 --> 36:15.303
Oh...
Unnhhh!

36:15.347 --> 36:16.261
Vannak!

36:21.091 --> 36:22.832
This isn't real.

36:24.399 --> 36:25.748
We belong here.

36:26.836 --> 36:28.186
Don't you see?

36:30.100 --> 36:33.495
There's a reason the keystones
led us to each other.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.149
They've been guiding us
this whole time,

36:35.193 --> 36:36.498
and now we're here.

36:39.371 --> 36:41.503
Let's finish this together.

36:45.246 --> 36:46.987
Stay with me, John.

36:51.252 --> 36:53.167
You have to let go.

37:02.655 --> 37:03.656
No.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.398
No.

37:08.835 --> 37:10.097
Oh, John.

37:11.229 --> 37:12.534
No! No!

37:20.673 --> 37:21.978
Kai?

37:22.022 --> 37:24.416
Chief. I...

37:35.078 --> 37:36.123
Shit!

37:37.603 --> 37:39.779
-Riz!
-Stay away, Kai!

37:46.916 --> 37:48.396
Silver Team is down.

37:50.746 --> 37:53.445
We don't have much time before
we're completely overwhelmed.

37:55.403 --> 37:59.146
I've calculated three
possible routes out of here.

37:59.189 --> 38:01.279
We're not leaving
without the artifacts.

38:01.322 --> 38:03.106
That's not possible.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.804
The second you touch them,
you'll freeze up.

38:06.240 --> 38:07.633
Chief, are you listening to me?

38:09.635 --> 38:12.681
There's no way you can save
the artifacts and the team.

38:18.426 --> 38:19.340
Then you do it.

38:20.820 --> 38:22.822
-Do what?
-Take over my body.

38:22.865 --> 38:25.520
I told you, I no longer
want to control you.

38:25.564 --> 38:28.828
It's the only way to get the
artifacts and save the others.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.919
Chief, stop.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.707
I can't let you die.

38:40.579 --> 38:43.582
Find the Halo.
Win the war.

38:51.633 --> 38:53.679
I may not be able
to bring you back.

38:58.118 --> 38:59.424
I trust you.

39:23.970 --> 39:24.971
Chief.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.078
John.

40:02.051 --> 40:03.662
When the game is over,

40:03.705 --> 40:06.273
the king and the pawn
go back into the same box.

40:12.453 --> 40:13.759
Chief?

41:11.294 --> 41:13.383
Let's go!

41:13.427 --> 41:15.211
Come on, Riz! Get up!

41:26.309 --> 41:28.137
Chief, no!

42:14.401 --> 42:15.576
Riz.

42:17.578 --> 42:20.146
Riz! She's fading!

42:20.189 --> 42:23.062
Riz? Riz!

42:23.105 --> 42:24.498
Oh, shit!

42:28.197 --> 42:29.634
She's crashing!

42:29.677 --> 42:31.244
Oh, God.

42:34.290 --> 42:36.554
Multiple ribs busted.

42:37.903 --> 42:40.470
We're gonna fix you.

42:40.514 --> 42:42.821
Left lung compromised.
Come on!

42:42.864 --> 42:44.779
It's okay, Riz.
We're here.

42:46.868 --> 42:49.567
Do you hear me? Riz?

43:20.859 --> 43:22.817
Stay with me, Riz.

43:29.781 --> 43:31.783
We are on a journey.

43:33.698 --> 43:35.787
We are born, we live,

43:35.830 --> 43:39.007
and we die according
to the rules

43:39.051 --> 43:42.402
of blind and unguided
evolution.

43:42.445 --> 43:44.012
As a result,

43:44.056 --> 43:47.146
our species is simply
not equipped

43:47.189 --> 43:50.192
to survive what comes next.

43:50.236 --> 43:55.545
It is time for us to take
control of our evolution,

43:55.589 --> 43:59.245
to push past
our narrow ignorance

43:59.288 --> 44:02.552
and venture out
into the wide unknown,

44:02.596 --> 44:06.644
where we will discover
our true potential.

44:06.687 --> 44:10.560
I suspect the Halo
will provide the key.

44:10.604 --> 44:11.823
Dr. Halsey?

44:13.259 --> 44:15.522
I'm to take you
to the space tether.

44:15.565 --> 44:17.567
There's a ship leaving soon.

44:25.575 --> 44:27.403
Much has been lost,

44:27.447 --> 44:30.711
and there will surely
be more sacrifices to come.

44:35.803 --> 44:40.242
But I believe our species
will soon spread its wings

44:40.286 --> 44:44.159
and soar to new heights,

44:44.203 --> 44:45.770
that we will rewrite

44:45.813 --> 44:48.120
what it means to be human.

44:49.948 --> 44:51.819
That we will achieve...

44:53.516 --> 44:55.344
transcendence.

45:39.954 --> 45:41.129
John?

45:42.217 --> 45:43.566
Is that you?
