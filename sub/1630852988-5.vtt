00:06.006 --> 00:07.424
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:07.507 --> 00:09.134
What are you doing here?

00:09.217 --> 00:12.178
I got bored in the apartment
and wanted to come.

00:12.262 --> 00:14.305
What a drag, doing fuck all there.

00:14.389 --> 00:16.182
What the fuck are you doing in my house?

00:16.683 --> 00:18.977
Dude, I'm not here to fight, so relax.

00:19.060 --> 00:20.645
We're going now, okay? All good.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.814
- Don't worry, Mateo.
- No, we don't have to go.

00:22.897 --> 00:23.732
Don't go.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.861
Relax. There's always
a gate-crasher at every party.

00:29.112 --> 00:33.241
But that shouldn't ruin the night
for our new star.

00:35.118 --> 00:35.952
Come.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.753
I want to introduce you all
to the new lead of our show.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.756
Karina Rojas.

00:51.634 --> 00:53.261
Why didn't you tell me?

00:53.344 --> 00:56.222
Because I haven't accepted any role.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.516
I think your friend
is double-crossing you.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.643
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.479
- Leave--
- This is bullshit.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.064
Calm down, Karina.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.232
You can all go fuck yourselves.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.405
Karina, wait.

01:14.115 --> 01:15.658
- Tell me the truth.
- What?

01:15.742 --> 01:17.243
What the hell do you want?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.080
You know what I think?

01:20.163 --> 01:23.041
You broke up your group
to stay at the Royal.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.418
I'm here because <i>you </i>put me here.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.421
- No one lied to you.
- Karina.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.882
It's Álex. Take it. He says it's urgent.

01:32.300 --> 01:35.804
- Is it Grandma?
- No, she's fine.

01:38.765 --> 01:39.891
It's…

01:41.184 --> 01:44.729
Look, I need you to do me a favor, okay?
Come pick me up.

01:46.064 --> 01:47.857
What happened? Where?

01:47.941 --> 01:51.319
<i>I was at Vicente's house,</i>
<i>and the cops came for Checho.</i>

01:51.402 --> 01:52.737
<i>I'm here under arrest.</i>

01:53.905 --> 01:55.448
- Fuck!
- What's going on?

01:55.532 --> 01:58.618
They went to Vicente's
and took my brother to the station.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.120
How come?

02:00.745 --> 02:02.747
- They're looking for Checho.
- What?

02:05.083 --> 02:05.917
Officer.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.961
Yes, it's Mateo again.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.880
Yes, I know.

02:12.173 --> 02:15.051
I know he's not there
because he came to my house.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.354
Shit.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.273
It hurts.

02:35.446 --> 02:36.447
Hey!

02:39.576 --> 02:40.577
Hey!

02:41.786 --> 02:43.288
Hey, I'm locked in!

02:48.293 --> 02:50.253
Dude, open the door now, man.

02:50.336 --> 02:52.839
- I'm going to get the key. Hang on.
- Fuck!

02:52.922 --> 02:55.091
Easy, don't break the door.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.261
- What are you doing, Mateo?
- What happened?

02:58.344 --> 02:59.846
I'm coming.

03:00.471 --> 03:02.473
- Let's go.
- Are the cops here?

03:02.557 --> 03:03.558
Yeah, let's go.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.185
Fucking hell!

03:05.810 --> 03:08.146
National Police. The party's over.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.772
Round these people up.

03:11.191 --> 03:12.650
- Come on.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.487
- You two. Don't move.
- Documents. Come on.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.032
- Who is Sergio Parra?
- This thing is over.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.326
- Let's go.
- Come on. Documents.

03:21.409 --> 03:22.493
- What's up?
- Where is he?

03:22.577 --> 03:23.661
Where's who?

03:23.745 --> 03:25.705
- The gate-crasher.
- Documents in your hands.

03:25.788 --> 03:27.040
Documents. Now!

03:28.917 --> 03:30.376
Those guys aren't here!

03:31.336 --> 03:33.838
Karina said they went to Vis's
to look for you.

03:33.922 --> 03:36.466
- How did those fuckers know I was here?
- I don't know.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.469
- Those fuckers have a snitch, right?
- <i>He's none of these.</i>

03:39.552 --> 03:43.806
- He's wearing an orange shirt. He left.
- Let's go. You heard. Orange shirt.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.519
Karina's going to kill me, man.

03:49.437 --> 03:50.271
Why?

03:50.813 --> 03:52.565
She doesn't know what you're up to?

03:53.524 --> 03:54.859
She has no idea.

04:00.990 --> 04:03.076
Why do you do this, Álex?

04:08.039 --> 04:11.251
You have to get out of this shit.
And look for…

04:12.168 --> 04:15.880
I don't know. Something you like
that you'll be able to live off.

04:16.756 --> 04:17.632
What do you like?

04:19.968 --> 04:20.969
Wow.

04:42.156 --> 04:44.993
That shit's no good to anyone.
Look at my sister.

04:45.493 --> 04:46.577
Why don't you try?

04:49.580 --> 04:50.581
I'll help you.

04:54.585 --> 04:55.586
Look…

04:56.921 --> 05:00.216
Some of us can't afford
the luxury of doing what we like.

Who is Vicente?

05:06.764 --> 05:08.641

13:37.399 --> 13:39.109
- Who is it?

13:39.819 --> 13:43.697
If you want us to come out alive,
you have to do exactly as I say.

13:43.781 --> 13:44.782

What's up?

14:03.175 --> 14:04.176
Excellent.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.971
Why are you in this shithole?
Why are you in this shithole?

14:08.764 --> 14:10.891
They told us you brought good company.
They told us you brought good company.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.602
No, dude, you're too late.
No, dude, you're too late.

14:14.979 --> 14:15.813
She left.
She left.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.941
- If you like, I'll introduce you later.
- Hey.
-If you like, I'll introduce you later.
-Hey.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.611
- No, dude. Shit at your house, not here.
- I'm just going to piss.
-No, dude. Shit at your house, not here.
-I'm just going to piss.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.032
You hear, Checho?
You hear, Checho?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.203
Is everything all right?
Is everything all right?

14:33.247 --> 14:35.082
- All good.
- Yeah? Sure?

-Yeah? Sure?

14:36.292 --> 14:37.543
- Sure.
- What are you up to?
-Sure.
-What are you up to?

14:38.127 --> 14:39.795
The boss is worried about you.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.465
He doesn't like
you drawing attention to yourself.
He doesn't like
you drawing attention to yourself.

14:46.343 --> 14:49.555
Tell him I'm set on selling again
as soon as things cool down.
Tell him I'm set on selling again
as soon as things cool down.

14:50.222 --> 14:54.727
But when? When, man?
There's a lot of work to do.
But when? When, man?
There's a lot of work to do.

14:54.810 --> 14:58.147
He's got a very important job
for you to do. A juicy one.
He's got a very important job
for you to do. A juicy one.

14:58.731 --> 14:59.732
Tasty.
Tasty.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.526
Let me give you some advice, Checho.
Let me give you some advice, Checho.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.570
Do your duty.
Do your duty.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.324
Behave sensibly. Don't show your bad side.
Behave sensibly. Don't show your bad side.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.125
Sure. All good.
Sure. All good.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.711
Without further ado…
Without further ado…

15:25.007 --> 15:26.550
So you don't forget me again.
So you don't forget me again.

15:30.638 --> 15:34.433
What's the holdup?
What are you doing? Taking a selfie?
What's the holdup?
What are you doing? Taking a selfie?

15:35.184 --> 15:36.185
Let's go.
Let's go.

16:01.251 --> 16:03.712
- Keep an eye on him, okay?
- All good.
-Keep an eye on him, okay?
-All good.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.050
Checho, who were those guys?
Checho, who were those guys?

16:10.094 --> 16:13.389
I almost had a hea

16:13.472 --> 16:16.976
No one. Don't worry, okay?
Those guys don't matter.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.270
They don't matter?
Tell me what's happening, please.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.023
Tell me. What is it?

16:24.775 --> 16:26.777
-Tell me.
-I'm fucked, that's what.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.739
Because of your scum ex-boyfriend,
they've got me by the balls.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.492
That's it.

16:42.918 --> 16:43.794
<i>Majo.</i>

16:43.877 --> 16:47.381
Unfortunately,
despite the effort you've made,

16:47.464 --> 16:51.301
we won't have enough time for you
to get to the level the show needs.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.013
Jacobo, why don't you just say it?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.599
We already know
who you offered the lead to.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.018
And she won't accept.

17:00.728 --> 17:02.813
She already did. She accepted.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.481
Karina will be the lead.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.526
-What?
-No way!

17:09.069 --> 17:10.112
That's not fair.

17:11.488 --> 17:15.951
That girl's going to learn in two weeks
what we've been rehearsing for months?

17:17.077 --> 17:20.164
<i>Don't worry. I came to learn,</i>
<i>not to take your place.</i>

17:20.748 --> 17:21.832
Okay, guys.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.376
I didn't come to fuck you over.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.880
I came to get you the place
you lost in the Iberoamericano.

17:27.963 --> 17:30.382
We have to present
something unique, fresh.

17:30.466 --> 17:35.763
So, please. Let's leave our egos aside
and start to push in the same direction.

17:36.346 --> 17:37.848
There's too much work ahead.

17:38.515 --> 17:39.725
Mateo, please.

17:39.808 --> 17:40.809
Karina.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.774
Please stand up.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.276
Start from…

17:49.359 --> 17:50.861
"'Tis but thy name."

17:53.781 --> 17:57.701
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.746
What? Sorry. Just…

18:02.581 --> 18:04.750
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou…

18:04.833 --> 18:07.211
-No, sorry.
-From here.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.509
"Thou art thyself, though not a Montague."

18:13.592 --> 18:14.718
May I?

18:17.304 --> 18:20.140
So at least she knows how to start.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.352
Go on, Antonia.

18:33.320 --> 18:37.866
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.661
What's Montague?

18:42.162 --> 18:47.292
It is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm,
nor any other part belonging to a man.

18:49.169 --> 18:50.838
O, be some other name!

18:52.673 --> 18:56.593
That which we call a rose
by any other name would smell as sweet.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.930
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,

19:00.013 --> 19:03.559
retain that dear perfection
which he owes without that title.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.979
Romeo, doff thy name,
which is no part of thee.

19:07.729 --> 19:10.274
Do you still think the lead can get there?

19:24.288 --> 19:28.125
And I thought that Juliet
was going to wake up in a cell

19:29.209 --> 19:31.587
after having helped a delinquent escape.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.799
You owe me a lot of things.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.177
An apology.

19:39.094 --> 19:40.596
And 2.5 million pesos.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.014
-An apology?
-Yes.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.766
You'll be waiting for it.

19:45.976 --> 19:48.937
-I'll pay you the money when I have it.
-When?

19:52.149 --> 19:56.695
I don't know, Mateo. When I have it.
The last thing I want is to owe you money.

19:57.279 --> 20:01.116
What will your mom think
when she hears you're going out with him?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.201
I wonder.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.620
I don't know.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.207
She never said anything
when she saw me with you.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.209
And you nearly killed me.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.336
-You're together.
-Let me pass.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.171
-Mateo, enough.
-So fast.

20:14.254 --> 20:15.130
-Mateo.
-Hey!

20:15.797 --> 20:17.090
Let her pass.

20:22.763 --> 20:23.597
Butt out.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.309
Save yourself the hassle.

20:37.361 --> 20:38.362
Antonia.

20:39.488 --> 20:40.405
Wait.

20:40.489 --> 20:42.783
-What do you want?
-What would you have done?

20:45.202 --> 20:46.954
Obviously, I would have said yes.

20:47.788 --> 20:49.998
This is my dream, Karina, not yours.

20:50.082 --> 20:51.250
I'm a dancer too.

20:52.209 --> 20:55.963
I've been busting my ass for years
looking for an opportunity.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.173
What chance have I had like this?

20:58.257 --> 20:59.258
What can I say?

21:00.133 --> 21:03.262
Make the most of it now that you have it.
You saved the Royal.

21:03.345 --> 21:04.346
No way.

21:05.264 --> 21:07.641
-Didn't you see what happened?
-Yes.

21:08.725 --> 21:10.018
Honestly, it was terrible.

21:10.519 --> 21:13.522
I honestly don't know
what you did to get that part.

21:14.481 --> 21:17.943
Think what you want.
I only wanted to make up with you.

21:18.026 --> 21:20.112
-I see that I can't.
-I have an idea.

21:20.654 --> 21:25.117
Call me and I'll give you acting classes,
which, by the way, you need,

21:25.617 --> 21:28.328
and when you slip up,
I'll do the same thing to you.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.539
Bye.

21:39.881 --> 21:40.716
Hello.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.635
If I were you,
I wouldn't waste any rehearsal time.

21:44.219 --> 21:46.346
I have to work now, but…

21:47.431 --> 21:50.309
when I get a moment, I'll go and practice.

21:50.392 --> 21:52.728
This is a full-time profession, Karina.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.397
This show requires all your effort.

21:56.106 --> 21:59.359
I need you to be there,
present, committed.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.613
-Otherwise it's not going to work.
-Bernardo, this is Jacobo.

22:03.697 --> 22:06.325
-The new artistic director.
-Nice to meet you.

22:06.408 --> 22:09.870
Jacobo, this is Bernardo,
one of our sponsors.

22:09.953 --> 22:11.747
-Great.
-Possible sponsors.

22:12.998 --> 22:17.586
After we tell you what we're doing,
you'll be all in.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.464
Go ahead.

22:40.567 --> 22:44.946
GET LOST

22:45.030 --> 22:46.198
GET OUT

23:02.589 --> 23:05.634
The most important thing
is to learn the passport details.

23:07.594 --> 23:08.595
When do you leave?

23:10.555 --> 23:11.556
Why?

23:15.560 --> 23:18.063
A friend wants to send a package
to the other side.

23:19.648 --> 23:21.066
He would buy the ticket.

23:22.192 --> 23:24.403
And give you good money for doing it.

23:26.613 --> 23:28.281
Are you interested or not?

23:32.160 --> 23:33.745
How much are we talking?

23:34.246 --> 23:35.414
Five thousand dollars.

23:56.518 --> 23:58.437
<i>'Tis but thy name that is my enemy.</i>

24:01.481 --> 24:03.942
<i>Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.</i>

24:07.696 --> 24:10.157
<i>So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called…</i>

24:19.666 --> 24:20.876
What's up, gorgeous?

24:20.959 --> 24:24.129
If I asked you to do
something important for me, would you?

24:24.838 --> 24:25.797
What do you mean?

24:26.423 --> 24:30.844
Something important for me,
my life, my career. Would you do it?

24:32.137 --> 24:33.138
Obviously.

24:34.139 --> 24:36.099
What's up? Why are you asking me this?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.477
I need you to help me with something.

24:42.105 --> 24:44.441
I don't get what we came here to do.

24:44.524 --> 24:47.652
-Checho asked me to get us to meet up.
-Checho?

24:48.945 --> 24:51.615
Yes. He told me he has to ask us a favor.

24:51.698 --> 24:55.118
Well, can you see how I'm dying
to do your brother a favor?

24:55.202 --> 24:57.913
-I hope a dog eats him.
-Well, we're here now.

24:57.996 --> 24:59.372
Let's see what he says.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.666
Checho isn't coming.

25:02.876 --> 25:05.545
You're here
because I asked him to arrange it.

25:07.214 --> 25:08.632
What for?

25:12.677 --> 25:14.471
I want to reunite Pura Kaye.

27:09.127 --> 27:14.132
