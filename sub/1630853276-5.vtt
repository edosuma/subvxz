00:01.262 --> 00:03.133
Previously on "Billy the Kid"...

00:05.005 --> 00:07.137
Wanna do some practicing?
I'll bring the Winchester.

00:14.144 --> 00:15.493
Come on,
let's get outta here, Jesse.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.499
I was thinking
of heading back into Texas,

00:21.630 --> 00:25.286
pick up some work.
Maybe you wanna string along?

00:25.416 --> 00:26.591
If you can rope and ride,

00:26.722 --> 00:27.766
them ranchers don't care
about nothin' else.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.725
Whoo!

00:29.855 --> 00:33.033
You're an outlaw now, boy.
You ain't got a lot of options.

00:33.163 --> 00:35.426
Heard some horses
got stolen up at Camp Grant.

00:35.557 --> 00:36.819
Did you steal him, boy?

00:41.519 --> 00:42.868
I killed a man.

00:42.999 --> 00:44.522
I didn't mean to.

00:44.653 --> 00:47.134
I had no choice.

00:48.526 --> 00:50.528
I have to go back.

00:50.659 --> 00:52.400
Tell the truth.

00:52.530 --> 00:55.098
You have been arrested
for the foul murder

00:55.229 --> 00:57.579
of Windy Cahill. I order you
placed in the guardhouse

00:57.709 --> 00:58.797
under surveillance.

01:04.673 --> 01:07.067
What am I doing here?
I don't remember much.

01:07.197 --> 01:09.330
I run with a group
called the Seven River Gang.

01:09.460 --> 01:12.463
One of the boys recognized you,
brought you here.

01:12.594 --> 01:14.465
There are "Wanted" posters
for you all over the state.

01:14.596 --> 01:16.511
How long are your boys
gonna be away?

01:16.641 --> 01:18.426
Another week or so, I guess.

01:23.648 --> 01:24.823
They're back.

02:12.915 --> 02:15.918
-Aah!

02:20.052 --> 02:21.271
Whoo!

02:31.890 --> 02:34.328
-Billy.
-Hey, boys.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.590
It's been a while.

02:35.720 --> 02:36.939
You're alive.

02:37.069 --> 02:40.595
I guess I am.

02:40.725 --> 02:42.684
I've missed you.

02:42.814 --> 02:48.298
Thank God we found you.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.779
Fellas, this here...

02:50.909 --> 02:52.824
is a very old friend of mine--
Kid Antrim.

02:55.697 --> 02:58.308
Billy,
Bob Olinger, John Beckwith.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.223
Good to meet you.

03:04.227 --> 03:08.753
Hope Barbara has been
taking care of you?

03:08.884 --> 03:11.495
She took care of me
like a nurse, Jesse.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.889
Couldn't have been kinder.

03:21.679 --> 03:26.118
-Make some room.
-Take that hat off.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.729
We've seen posters of you.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.818
-Hey! Watch it!
-Yeah. That might be

03:29.948 --> 03:32.212
a problem, I mean
if you wanted to ride with us.

03:32.342 --> 03:33.822
You being wanted
and your picture everywhere.

03:35.737 --> 03:36.607
That picture don't look
anything like Billy.

03:38.609 --> 03:41.482
Hey, hey.
I'm just saying, Jesse.

03:41.612 --> 03:44.746
If I want Billy
to ride with us...

03:44.876 --> 03:46.878
then he rides with us.

03:51.579 --> 03:54.582
-Got that?
-Yup.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.975
Enough said.
Whoo!

04:01.806 --> 04:05.636
Mmm. Want more?

04:48.723 --> 04:52.466
We're thinking of going out
to El Paso.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.424
You wanna join us, Billy?

04:54.555 --> 04:56.121
Maybe.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.949
What's stopping you?

05:00.735 --> 05:03.912
I still have a hankering
to go straight, Jesse.

05:04.042 --> 05:05.479
You're wanted
in two counties.

05:05.609 --> 05:07.959
How's that gonna happen?

05:13.008 --> 05:17.099
You want him to stay
with us, don't you?

05:19.710 --> 05:22.670
Yes, I do.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.846
I'd love for him to stay.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.632
Just how much do you love him?

05:28.763 --> 05:32.636
Just as much as I want to.

05:32.767 --> 05:35.683
Yeah, come on.

05:35.813 --> 05:38.686
I joined you so I could be free,

05:38.816 --> 05:41.210
not with them Calvinists
who didn't give me any choice

05:41.341 --> 05:42.864
and whipped me
for having feelings,

05:42.994 --> 05:46.084
and stopped me from having
any sense of who I was.

05:46.215 --> 05:48.217
You should know that, Jesse.

05:48.348 --> 05:53.788
Oh, I know that all right.

05:55.137 --> 05:59.620
Yup. Yup. Yup.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.752
It should be a good show.

06:01.883 --> 06:04.668
It's gonna be exciting.

06:04.799 --> 06:05.800
Pick it up! Come on.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.516
Barbara!

06:28.866 --> 06:30.564
This isn't gonna work.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.437
He should accept what is.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.138
I'm talking about me.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.794
I'm not sure I can accept
having to share you.

06:45.927 --> 06:47.407
You gotta grow up, Billy.

06:49.321 --> 06:50.714
I love you.

07:06.861 --> 07:08.210
You see?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.742
I won't belong to either
of you, Billy.

07:22.920 --> 07:23.878
Wait.

07:36.020 --> 07:37.892
I need a horse.

07:42.723 --> 07:43.854
Why?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.249
'Cause of what Olinger said.

07:49.077 --> 07:51.166
Me riding with you
ain't a good idea.

07:55.083 --> 07:57.651
That the real reason?

07:57.781 --> 07:59.957
What'd you mean?

08:00.088 --> 08:04.484
I mean, the thing going on
between you and Barbara.

08:04.614 --> 08:06.660
And just tell me, you do it in
your bed or you do it in mine?

08:11.882 --> 08:13.493
Are you gonna lend me
a horse or not?

08:21.370 --> 08:23.633
Send it back when you can.

08:26.027 --> 08:29.987
Thank you.

08:30.118 --> 08:32.816
Why don't you stay
with us for the day?

08:32.947 --> 08:36.385
I want the boys to see
your skills before you go.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.344
You'll put 'em all to shame.

08:47.962 --> 08:49.398
-Let's go! Let's go.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.749
-Whoo!

08:52.880 --> 08:53.924
That's how you shoot!

08:54.055 --> 08:54.882
Here we go, Boss!
Here we go!

08:55.012 --> 08:56.797
Whoa!

09:11.072 --> 09:12.421
I've seen better.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.249
Nice shootin', kid.

09:14.379 --> 09:15.903
-That's all right.
-Nice shooting, boy.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.731
How fast are you, kid?

10:55.002 --> 10:57.482
You gotta get quicker
on the draw, Billy...

10:57.613 --> 11:00.398
or you're a dead man.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.124
Jesse, don't.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.955
Why not?

12:19.086 --> 12:21.392
-You have no cause to shoot him.
-No?

12:21.523 --> 12:23.743
He never did any wrong,
and you know he didn't.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.965
That's what you say.

12:29.096 --> 12:32.882
And you know what?
You can't shoot him.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.890
Why is that?

12:48.680 --> 12:50.421
'Cause you love him.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.566
This Chihuahua?

15:29.276 --> 15:31.278
Hola, señor.

15:31.408 --> 15:32.366
Hola.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.622
Gracias.

16:55.231 --> 16:57.016
Ah, shit.

17:32.355 --> 17:34.314
Buenos días.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.879
Hey!

18:41.946 --> 18:43.339
Uhh!

19:49.144 --> 19:51.929
Melquiades Segura.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.497
You?

19:54.628 --> 19:56.717
William Bonney.

19:56.847 --> 19:59.415
I think this is your first time
in Chihuahua, no, William?

19:59.546 --> 20:00.982
It's my first time in Mexico.

20:01.112 --> 20:05.508
Okay. I could tell.

20:05.639 --> 20:09.469
And so could those bandits.

20:09.599 --> 20:12.559
They weren't just trying
to rob me, were they?

20:12.689 --> 20:13.908
They were tryin' to kill me.

20:14.038 --> 20:17.433
You have to understand.

20:17.564 --> 20:19.348
A lot of people here...

20:19.479 --> 20:21.394
Hey!

20:21.524 --> 20:23.439
They don't like gringos.

20:23.570 --> 20:26.137
There's been a lot
of trouble recently

20:26.268 --> 20:29.010
with Americans trying
to grab land.

20:29.140 --> 20:32.100
This has always been our land.

20:32.231 --> 20:35.277
Now it is being stolen.

20:35.408 --> 20:38.672
There have been a lot
of shootings and murders, and...

20:38.802 --> 20:43.851
people are angry.

20:43.981 --> 20:45.635
My own father
was killed that way.

20:51.685 --> 20:54.383
Why are you here?

20:58.822 --> 21:00.824
Running away from something.

21:00.955 --> 21:04.350
What do you do for a living?

21:04.480 --> 21:08.441
Whatever I can.

21:08.571 --> 21:10.443
What about you?

21:10.573 --> 21:16.536
Me? I'm a gambler.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.060
Do you play poker?

21:19.190 --> 21:22.411
Sure, I do.

21:24.761 --> 21:27.416
You have any money left on you?

21:27.547 --> 21:30.332
A little bit.

21:30.463 --> 21:34.118
The first thing you're gonna
need in this town is a gun.

21:36.556 --> 21:37.470
Hmm.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.586
Aw, shit.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.947
All right.

22:20.077 --> 22:22.993
I'll wager you two pesos
you can't hit that can.

22:35.963 --> 22:39.488
Hmm. Too bad.

22:51.195 --> 22:53.154
Huh.

22:59.334 --> 23:00.640
Muchas gracias.

23:08.996 --> 23:11.520
Hey,
you told me you play poker.

23:11.651 --> 23:12.739
Mm-hmm.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.393
How well do you play poker?

23:14.523 --> 23:16.046
-Pretty well.
-As good as you shoot?

23:17.961 --> 23:20.834
Look, there's a big game
in town.

23:20.964 --> 23:21.878
The dealer is this man
called Don Ortiz.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.750
Okay.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.753
I'm a pretty good player,
but I lost a lot of money.

23:26.883 --> 23:28.668
Maybe you're not as good
as you think you are, then.

23:28.798 --> 23:32.498
No, no, no, hey! Hey!
He cheats.

23:32.628 --> 23:37.720
I'm not sure how he cheats,
but I'm pretty sure he does it.

23:37.851 --> 23:40.854
I wanna win my money back...

23:40.984 --> 23:43.073
and in the process,
break Don Ortiz.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.945
That's a tall order.

23:45.075 --> 23:48.252
Never had a good poker player
to play with me.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.733
So you wanna double-team him?

23:50.864 --> 23:56.739
I think you can do it.
You're not scared.

23:56.870 --> 24:00.613
Ortiz is a dangerous man,
but from what I've seen,

24:00.743 --> 24:05.531
so are you.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.097
It's your choice.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.550
Bueno.Careful, huh?

24:24.680 --> 24:27.944
Or we're dead.

24:44.874 --> 24:45.745
Don Ortiz.

25:07.941 --> 25:09.812
Un gringo.

25:17.559 --> 25:20.954
Sit down.
You are very welcome...

25:21.084 --> 25:22.172
Gringo.

27:13.196 --> 27:14.894
Muchas gracias.

27:15.024 --> 27:17.810
Buenas noches.

27:29.169 --> 27:32.041
You got your money.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.652
I'm never going back
in there again.

27:33.782 --> 27:36.959
I thought I was gonna have
to shoot my way out.

27:37.090 --> 27:39.222
Nice.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.007
Tonight,
I'm gonna sleep like a baby.

27:41.137 --> 27:43.270
Sleep?

27:43.400 --> 27:46.186
No, no. Hey, hey, who said
anything about sleep?

27:53.236 --> 27:55.412
This is my friend.
He's a gringo.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.197
Really.

28:35.365 --> 28:40.370
-Hola.
-Hola.

28:42.329 --> 28:44.113
-Gracias.

28:48.465 --> 28:51.860
She's Maria,
and I'm Juliana.

28:53.906 --> 28:55.037
Sí.

29:01.000 --> 29:01.914
Billy.

29:04.655 --> 29:07.441
So why are you here
in Chihuahua?

29:38.733 --> 29:40.866
Will you buy us a drink?

29:40.996 --> 29:42.041
Sí.

29:48.134 --> 29:49.918
I've heard of the family, eh?

29:50.049 --> 29:51.050
They're rich.

30:02.148 --> 30:03.540
Be very polite, huh?

30:03.671 --> 30:06.108
Hey, and mind your manners.

30:06.239 --> 30:09.416
This is a very old
and respectable family.

30:09.546 --> 30:11.679
You wouldn't know it
from the way they danced.

30:11.810 --> 30:15.248
You don't understand
Mexican girls, mi hijo.

30:15.378 --> 30:17.076
They can dance like that, yes,

30:17.206 --> 30:18.991
but they also want
to stay virgins

30:19.121 --> 30:20.688
for the day they get married.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.037
You know, they were brought up
pretty religiously.

30:22.168 --> 30:25.040
It's...the way they are.

30:25.171 --> 30:27.260
It's like a promise
to their future husband.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.349
You marry me, you get all this!

30:29.479 --> 30:31.438
-Naw, you're fuckin' with me.
-Oh, I'm not fucking with you.

30:31.568 --> 30:34.180
I've lived with this
my whole life.

30:34.310 --> 30:36.051
-You're serious?

30:36.182 --> 30:38.271
-Yes.
-Well, how do I look?

30:40.839 --> 30:43.537
Okay. Let me just see.
Here.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.325
Escapulario.

30:49.456 --> 30:52.285
Huh. It was my dad's.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.332
-Ay, que chulo!

31:02.425 --> 31:05.298
Hey. Knock on the door.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.144
Muchas gracias.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.340
Don't pay any attention to Mama.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.777
She still lives
in another world.

32:33.908 --> 32:35.257
Maximillian!

32:41.655 --> 32:44.527
We have prepared
the guest room for you...

32:44.658 --> 32:46.312
if you would like
to stay the night.

32:50.229 --> 32:54.320
You want us to stay?

32:54.450 --> 32:56.757
We have made
some nice plans for you.

33:05.287 --> 33:06.419
Okay.

33:06.549 --> 33:08.943
Hey, hey.

33:09.074 --> 33:10.945
These sisters are
the richest people in town.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.382
-You have to be awake.

33:15.254 --> 33:16.690
Hola.

33:22.348 --> 33:24.698
Sí, señora. Sí.

33:24.828 --> 33:27.048
Muchas gracias.

33:30.486 --> 33:37.363
Um, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

33:37.493 --> 33:40.366
Buenas noches.

33:40.496 --> 33:42.063
Muchas gracias.

33:46.024 --> 33:49.201
Buenas noches, señora.

33:49.331 --> 33:50.419
Hasta luego.

33:55.598 --> 33:57.339
Thank you.

34:02.910 --> 34:03.867
Shh, shh.

34:39.512 --> 34:45.431
No, no, no, no, no.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.389
Hey.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.739
Wake up! Our money!

34:49.870 --> 34:51.045
What are you doing?

34:51.176 --> 34:54.614
-Our money! Our money!
-Where is it?

34:54.744 --> 34:55.919
They made fools of us!

34:56.050 --> 34:59.314
-What?
-It's gone.

35:01.273 --> 35:03.101
Oh, fuck!

35:07.583 --> 35:08.454
No, no, no, hey.

35:08.584 --> 35:10.673
Let's go get it.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.632
-Let's go get it.
-Okay.

35:32.347 --> 35:33.218
Señora.

36:20.482 --> 36:23.050
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

36:23.181 --> 36:24.965
Easy, easy. Come on.

36:28.273 --> 36:29.535
That was one
big, fat, fucking mistake.

36:29.665 --> 36:31.624
Ah! I didn't hear you
complain about coming here!

36:31.754 --> 36:34.279
Because I trusted you!

36:36.150 --> 36:38.457
What are we gonna do?

36:38.587 --> 36:40.067
I don't know.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.591
You tell me.
What are we gonna do?

37:03.699 --> 37:05.005
Buenas.

37:40.040 --> 37:42.695
Señor?

37:42.825 --> 37:44.436
Señor?

37:46.481 --> 37:48.309
Señor?

37:58.841 --> 38:01.583
-Come! What was that?
-I can't do this.

38:01.714 --> 38:03.585
You can't do this?
We talked about this.

38:03.716 --> 38:07.502
You don't understand.
I'm not a criminal.

38:07.633 --> 38:10.200
Oh, Billy, Billy!

38:10.331 --> 38:12.681
I only shot someone once
in self-defense and...

38:12.812 --> 38:14.335
-No, no, no, no, no.
-I had no choice.

38:14.466 --> 38:17.643
No, you told me you rustled
cattle, you stole horses.

38:17.773 --> 38:20.950
-Those are crimes, my friend.
-But not against people.

38:21.081 --> 38:23.562
Against people...

38:23.692 --> 38:25.259
I don't rob stores
because people run them.

38:25.390 --> 38:26.826
I tried that once.
I'm not doing it again.

38:26.956 --> 38:28.480
That is not a store, Billy.
That is a bank.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.743
Yeah, this bank?

38:30.873 --> 38:33.833
We wouldn't be robbing
from the bank.

38:33.963 --> 38:34.660
We'd be robbing from all these
people and their savings.

38:36.401 --> 38:39.534
Including that mother
and her son.

38:39.665 --> 38:41.449
I won't do that. It's not right.

38:51.198 --> 38:52.460
Hey.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.718
Amigo.

42:48.130 --> 42:50.219
You done?

42:54.006 --> 42:58.924
Where are you planning on
going next, my friend?

42:59.054 --> 43:00.839
I don't know.

43:00.969 --> 43:04.277
There was a time
I thought I had a plan.

43:04.407 --> 43:07.933
I came down to Mexico
looking for a fresh start...

43:08.063 --> 43:09.325
place to make things right.

43:13.155 --> 43:15.201
Well, I have to go back
to New Mexico

43:15.331 --> 43:19.248
and take care
of some family business.

43:19.379 --> 43:21.729
Yeah, I gotta stay clear
of New Mexico for a while.

43:25.298 --> 43:28.606
Well, then, I guess this is it.

43:28.736 --> 43:32.435
This trail here takes me
to where I need to go.

43:32.566 --> 43:34.133
What about that way?

43:34.263 --> 43:37.092
Oh, that is Texas. Eh?

43:37.223 --> 43:42.924
Then maybe it's time
I took a look around Texas.

43:43.055 --> 43:45.231
I heard of this little town
once called El Paso.

43:45.361 --> 43:46.841
Hmm.

43:46.972 --> 43:50.628
Sounds about as good
a place as any.

43:50.758 --> 43:52.934
I hope you find what
you're looking for, Billy. Eh?

43:57.591 --> 44:00.986
All right. You go first.
