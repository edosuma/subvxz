WEBVTT

00:08.942 --> 00:10.244
Are you sure
you're not in the mood

00:10.344 --> 00:11.979
for something
a little more up-tempo?

00:12.113 --> 00:14.148
Dr. Novak, did you know

00:14.282 --> 00:17.618
that classical music
increases life expectancy?

00:17.751 --> 00:20.288
Could I have the
muscle retractor, please?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.456
You find me a study

00:22.590 --> 00:24.525
that proves Taylor Swift
does the same,

00:24.658 --> 00:26.460
and I'll happily retire Bach.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.096
I warned you.

00:28.196 --> 00:30.531
Never get Dr. Masuda
started on his music.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.966
All I said was,
let's change it up.

00:33.101 --> 00:35.035
'Cause Bach's gonna knock me out

00:35.169 --> 00:37.138
faster than the cocktail
I gave our patient here.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.007
Damn it.

00:40.141 --> 00:41.675
I nicked a vessel.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.544
Give me some irrigation.

00:43.677 --> 00:45.479
Pressure's dropping.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.881
Whole field's obscured. Suction.

00:48.015 --> 00:49.783
Give him two units
of blood.

00:51.685 --> 00:52.720
Clamp.

00:55.523 --> 00:57.191
I've got it.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.360
There.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.231
Try doing that
with Taylor Swift on.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.005
Dr. Masuda!

01:12.740 --> 01:13.807
He's having a seizure!

01:13.907 --> 01:15.209
Get me four
milligrams lorazepam.

01:15.343 --> 01:18.346
Turn him over!
He's not breathing.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.980
No pulse.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.350
Tom, can you hear me?

01:22.483 --> 01:26.019
Tom! Tom!

01:58.519 --> 01:59.753
Director.

01:59.887 --> 02:00.954
Thank you for waiting,
Agent Torres.

02:01.088 --> 02:02.556
Absolutely. Not a problem, sir.

02:04.392 --> 02:05.559
What is this?

02:05.693 --> 02:07.195
It's your new assignment. Ooh.

02:07.295 --> 02:09.297
Must be important if you're
calling me in solo.

02:09.430 --> 02:10.431
Am I going undercover?

02:10.564 --> 02:12.733
Kayla just returned from FLETC.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.802
She's beginning
her field training,

02:14.935 --> 02:17.271
and I want you to be her FTA.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.740
Oh, so babysitting
your daughter?

02:19.873 --> 02:23.244
My daughter just graduated
Basic Agent Training

02:23.377 --> 02:24.812
with flying colors, but still,

02:24.945 --> 02:27.080
I would like someone
to keep an eye on her.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.081
Of course.

02:28.216 --> 02:29.617
But why me?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.286
I've already selected
her first assignment.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.889
A reservist Navy surgeon

02:35.989 --> 02:37.825
suffered a heart attack
mid-operation.

02:37.958 --> 02:41.562
Mm, a heart attack, of course.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.831
Sir, uh, we don't
investigate those.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.567
Today you do.
Should be simple enough.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.402
Yeah, simple. Right.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.906
My daughter,

02:53.006 --> 02:54.675
she's smart,

02:54.808 --> 02:57.578
she's resourceful, and she
wants to prove herself here.

02:57.678 --> 03:00.113
Well, sounds like she's
gonna make a great agent, sir.

03:00.248 --> 03:01.949
Yeah, but she can
also be impulsive.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.817
You and I are both
well aware of the dangers

03:03.951 --> 03:06.153
that NCIS agents
face here daily.

03:06.287 --> 03:08.522
And you don't want her, uh,
anywhere near that danger.

03:08.656 --> 03:11.124
No father would,
which is why, Agent Torres,

03:11.259 --> 03:13.294
I'm trusting you
with my daughter.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.330
I bet you haven't
heard that before.

03:18.098 --> 03:21.001
I can't believe Barnsway
still teaches at FLETC.

03:21.134 --> 03:24.372
The man used to drink a full
carton of milk every class.

03:24.505 --> 03:27.475
Still does. The man put me off
dairy for at least six months.

03:27.608 --> 03:30.444
Do you have an active case?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.546
If not, I can check in
with the tip line.

03:32.680 --> 03:34.982
Oh, look at her, just chomping
at the bit to get started.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.017
You got that
first-day glow.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.552
I miss that.
I don't.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.887
Being a first-year's
all about being saddled

03:40.020 --> 03:41.021
with extra paperwork,

03:41.154 --> 03:42.490
lot of practical jokes.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.492
I'm telling you,
being a probie is-is rough.

03:44.625 --> 03:47.528
Actually, I want all of that. Well,

03:47.661 --> 03:49.330
don't expect
anything too exciting

03:49.463 --> 03:50.664
on your first assignment.

03:50.798 --> 03:51.732
Yeah, you'll
probably get

03:51.865 --> 03:53.801
what we call
a "toolbox" case.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.003
It's basic, simple. Boring.

03:56.136 --> 03:59.640
Kleicha, anyone?
National cookie of Iraq.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.241
Dig in, Kayla.

04:01.375 --> 04:03.411
So, uh, what're we
talking about?

04:03.544 --> 04:05.178
Our first times.

04:05.313 --> 04:08.816
Please tell me yours
was actually interesting.

04:12.520 --> 04:15.022
Our first times
in the field.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.925
Did I not say that?
Ah.

04:18.058 --> 04:20.594
Okay, I got two words
for you: "Killer zebras."

04:20.728 --> 04:22.062
You say zebras?

04:22.195 --> 04:23.864
I got to hear this.

04:23.997 --> 04:26.534
No time. We got our case.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.369
Let's go, Kayla.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.742
So, he just
collapsed suddenly?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.877
He just started convulsing.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.679
We did what we could, but...

04:38.779 --> 04:41.114
Any signs that he wasn't
feeling well beforehand?

04:41.248 --> 04:43.016
He was fine,

04:43.116 --> 04:44.418
making jokes.

04:44.552 --> 04:45.953
Mc
Then you had a complication

04:46.086 --> 04:47.220
with the patient?
Yes.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.689
A bleeder.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.391
We thought we were
going to lose him, but...

04:52.125 --> 04:54.094
...Dr. Masuda
saved his life.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.729
<i>I was in the next OR</i>

04:55.863 --> 04:57.097
when I heard
the shouts.

04:57.230 --> 04:58.399
By the time I came in,
they were already

04:58.532 --> 05:00.233
performing CPR.

05:00.368 --> 05:02.235
Masuda seems a little on the
young side for a heart attack.

05:02.370 --> 05:04.638
It's rare, but it happens.

05:04.772 --> 05:06.073
Your staff seems
pretty shook up.

05:06.206 --> 05:08.409
Dr. Masuda is...

05:08.542 --> 05:12.079
was one of our
best surgeons.

05:12.212 --> 05:13.814
We deal with death every day,

05:13.947 --> 05:16.584
but it's always a shock
when you lose one of your own.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.386
NURSE
Dr. Roth, we're ready for you.

05:18.486 --> 05:20.087
Patient's ready.

05:20.220 --> 05:21.455
I apologize, but I've got

05:21.589 --> 05:23.624
an emergency CES surgery
to attend.

05:23.757 --> 05:25.493
I have to go now.

05:25.626 --> 05:29.262
My dad asked you to keep
an eye on me, didn't he?

05:29.397 --> 05:30.898
I saw you coming down
from his office earlier.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.766
You got a pretty
good eye, probie.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.135
I don't want any special
treatment because of my father.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.237
Well, he's
the boss, so...
Agent Torres.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.508
Sorry, but you're not getting as
much as a paper cut on my watch.

05:43.744 --> 05:45.679
Look, you want to be
a good agent?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.516
Do you?
Mm-hmm.

05:48.649 --> 05:50.584
Then pay attention.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.620
We're gonna teach you
to be better than good.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.188
Tell me.

05:55.322 --> 05:57.190
What do you see?

05:57.324 --> 05:59.326
Highly contaminated crime scene.

05:59.460 --> 06:01.429
Hard to tell what's relevant
to the victim's death,

06:01.529 --> 06:03.697
so we collect everything.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.032
Kasie's gonna love hearing that.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.867
Eyewitness accounts
match up.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.169
They were two hours into the
surgery when Masuda went down.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.303
What do you got in here, Kayla?

06:12.172 --> 06:13.541
Body was disturbed.

06:13.674 --> 06:17.177
They tried CPR
to resuscitate the victim.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.846
Broke his ribs in the process,

06:18.979 --> 06:21.014
likely causing the red marks
on his chest.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.215
A-plus, Agent Vance.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.151
Every body
tells a story,

06:24.284 --> 06:26.286
and you just read
its final chapter.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.556
As for the rest of the book,
we now know that time of death

06:28.689 --> 06:31.492
was 9:47,
roughly two hours ago,

06:31.625 --> 06:34.628
so rigor mortis should be
minimal at this point,

06:34.728 --> 06:38.131
but look at this. Masuda's
muscles are completely rigid.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.367
That is definitely not
consistent with a heart attack.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.502
So, what killed him?

06:41.635 --> 06:42.570
Well, we got
frothing the mouth,

06:42.703 --> 06:44.071
cyanotic lips.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.639
I'll have to run blood work
to identify the toxin,

06:45.739 --> 06:47.074
but I would say

06:47.207 --> 06:49.209
Dr. Masuda
was poisoned.

06:49.342 --> 06:51.645
Murder? Great!

06:53.313 --> 06:56.684
I mean, it's no
boring toolbox case.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.029
Neurosurgeon Tom Masuda,

07:09.162 --> 07:11.599
38, Navy Reserve commander,
Medical Corps.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.100
No living family.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.502
Multiple deployments
to Iraq.

07:14.602 --> 07:16.704
He was awarded the
Meritorious Service Medal

07:16.837 --> 07:18.371
for saving
American lives abroad.

07:18.506 --> 07:19.773
Then, two years ago, Masuda

07:19.907 --> 07:21.675
settled down
at Shoreside Memorial.

07:21.775 --> 07:22.843
He was the golden boy.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.077
Staff, patients,

07:24.211 --> 07:25.779
everyone loved him.
Not everyone.

07:25.913 --> 07:26.947
Who wanted him dead?

07:27.080 --> 07:28.448
No one is that perfect.

07:28.582 --> 07:30.017
Masuda must have
an enemy.

07:30.117 --> 07:33.053
Maybe... an ex-girlfriend
or an old patient?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.287
I'd start the
interrogations there.

07:34.421 --> 07:36.056
Oh, patience,
young Padawan.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.625
We just began the investigation.
We don't go

07:37.758 --> 07:39.126
busting down doors quite yet.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.628
First, we
collect evidence.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.062
And then we go busting doors.

07:42.195 --> 07:43.931
Dug up some
deleted voice mails

07:44.064 --> 07:46.066
from Masuda's phone.
Listen to this.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.602
Doc, you got 24 hours.
Don't make me

07:48.736 --> 07:50.037
come after you.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.740
I'm done playing nice, Doc.
This is the last

07:52.873 --> 07:54.542
time I warn you.

07:54.642 --> 07:57.778
That's it, when I find you,
you're gonna wish you were dead.

07:59.279 --> 08:01.782
Sounds angry all right,
zebra-angry.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.417
That's the guy
who left the messages?

08:04.552 --> 08:06.554
Yup. Pulled the
phone records.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.656
Meet Smitty Hastings.

08:08.789 --> 08:12.059
He goes by "The Barracuda."
He's a seedy fellow.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.461
Been accused of fraud,
stalking, extortion,

08:14.595 --> 08:16.129
but nobody ever got
a conviction.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.065
We know where to find him?
He owns a bar downtown.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.567
Now we go busting doors.

08:22.770 --> 08:25.005
Hey, uh, Parker.
The zebra thing, you got to

08:25.138 --> 08:26.406
tell me about that. Oh.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.775
My first year, we were based
in California...

08:27.908 --> 08:30.310
San Simeon has those
wild zebras.

08:30.443 --> 08:33.246
Yeah. Yeah, so these zebras
wind up storming

08:33.346 --> 08:35.448
a winery like
a couple of bandits,

08:35.583 --> 08:36.784
and before we--

08:36.917 --> 08:37.785
Oh, hang on.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.587
Parker.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.488
Yeah, yeah.
No, no, go ahead.

08:41.622 --> 08:44.024
No, no, I got a minute.
Uh-huh.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.759
Okay.

08:48.328 --> 08:49.663
Kayla, you're staying
in the car.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.099
What? But I...

08:52.199 --> 08:53.701
Look, we don't know
what we're gonna find inside.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.002
I'll be careful.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.837
I know how to question
a suspect.

08:56.970 --> 08:59.472
Barnsway doesn't pass anyone who
doesn't. Right, Agent Knight?

09:00.941 --> 09:03.543
Well, the real world
isn't quite the same

09:03.677 --> 09:04.978
as a FLETC classroom.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.647
That's why I'm on
a field assignment.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.315
You promised you'd teach me.

09:08.448 --> 09:09.850
How am I gonna learn anything
waiting in the car?

09:09.983 --> 09:11.451
You're staying in the car.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.493
Taking care of
Jimmy's daughter,

09:20.628 --> 09:22.195
now watching over
the director's...

09:22.329 --> 09:24.497
Yeah, it's like "bring your
daughter to Torres" season.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.699
Never would've
pegged you for it.

09:25.833 --> 09:26.900
What?
Fatherhood.

09:27.034 --> 09:28.368
Suits you.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.503
You're protective,
you care.

09:30.638 --> 09:32.205
Cut it out.
No, it's a compliment.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.641
No. A compliment is like,
"Hey, Torres,

09:33.741 --> 09:35.242
you look so good
in that leather jacket."

09:35.375 --> 09:37.177
Not, "Torres, you look
like somebody's father."

09:37.310 --> 09:40.047
Hmm. I see you having
five daughters.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.882
What?

09:45.753 --> 09:47.020
Smitty Hastings?

09:49.857 --> 09:52.025
I'd bet on that horse.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.497
Smitty Hastings.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.867
NCIS Special Agents
Knight, Torres.

10:00.000 --> 10:03.003
We want to talk to you
about Tom Masuda.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.538
Yeah, what about him?
He's dead.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.941
Excuse me. Pardon me.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.243
It takes three of you
to tell me that?

10:10.377 --> 10:12.079
Got quiet out there.

10:12.212 --> 10:13.346
Hmm.
Thought something was up.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.581
You might need backup.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.286
Let me spell it out for you.

10:19.419 --> 10:22.089
You threatened to kill Masuda,
and now, well, you know,

10:22.222 --> 10:23.523
he's dead.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.192
I've got nothing
to do with that.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.593
Tell us about the voice mails.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.929
Courtesy calls.
Doc owed me money.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.098
How much does
a neurosurgeon make?

10:31.231 --> 10:33.233
I'd say about six figures. Yeah.

10:33.366 --> 10:35.135
Well, the good doctor

10:35.268 --> 10:37.370
also loved his ponies.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.872
Masuda liked to gamble?

10:48.215 --> 10:49.649
Masuda liked
to gamble?

10:49.783 --> 10:51.819
Liked?

10:51.952 --> 10:53.821
That man was addicted.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.588
Look,

10:55.723 --> 10:58.491
I am just the idiot
who loaned him some cash

10:58.625 --> 11:00.127
when he ran dry,

11:00.260 --> 11:02.730
and I should be
the last person you suspect.

11:02.830 --> 11:03.797
How's that?

11:03.931 --> 11:05.432
'Cause if I killed him,

11:05.565 --> 11:07.835
I wouldn't get my money back,
would I, Einstein?

11:07.968 --> 11:09.569
Well, maybe you were making
an example of him.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.338
You know, like a barracuda.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.307
Look... when did
you say he died?

11:14.441 --> 11:15.442
This morning.

11:15.575 --> 11:17.610
I've been out of town all week.

11:17.745 --> 11:20.080
I just got back an hour ago.
You have an alibi?

11:20.180 --> 11:22.182
It was my great-aunt's
funeral in Dorset,

11:22.315 --> 11:24.517
so yeah, I've got
at least 40 witnesses.

11:24.651 --> 11:27.520
Look, you speak to that
tart Doc was seeing?

11:27.654 --> 11:28.621
I don't know
her name,

11:28.756 --> 11:30.690
but the doc says she was into

11:30.824 --> 11:32.525
"extreme sports."

11:32.659 --> 11:34.527
I told him to shake that tail.

11:34.661 --> 11:37.630
Why?
The woman was crazy obsessed.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.266
Wouldn't let him break it off.

11:40.333 --> 11:42.635
I knew she was bad news.
Looks like I was right.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.537
Don't let it go
to your head.

11:46.139 --> 11:48.141
<i>What were you thinking,</i>

11:48.275 --> 11:50.377
walking into that bar?

11:50.510 --> 11:52.145
You disobeyed a direct order.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.114
An order no other probie
would've received.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.116
Doesn't matter
what the order is, Kayla.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.786
There's a chain of command.
Your job is to follow it.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.888
I understand,

12:01.021 --> 12:02.890
but how am I supposed to get
any field experience

12:03.023 --> 12:04.491
sitting in a car?
The point is,

12:04.624 --> 12:06.726
you endangered
not only yourself,

12:06.860 --> 12:09.196
but your fellow agents
with your recklessness.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.563
Recklessness?

12:10.697 --> 12:12.365
Agent Torres can tell you
it wasn't...

12:12.499 --> 12:14.367
I'm reassigning you to the lab.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.969
What?
Forensics is a very

12:16.069 --> 12:17.670
important part
to every agent's training.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.172
But we just got a new lead.

12:19.306 --> 12:21.341
Our victim was dating
some crazy stalker.

12:21.474 --> 12:22.675
We're close to ID'ing her.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.344
I don't want
to leave the case now.

12:24.477 --> 12:25.478
I'm sure the others can manage
without you, Kayla.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.814
Ms. Hines needs
your assistance

12:26.914 --> 12:28.816
with the evidence
that you collected.

12:28.916 --> 12:32.052
So... you're grounding me.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.653
I'm gonna let that go.

12:33.753 --> 12:34.988
You're pulling me out
of the field.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.990
What else would you call it?
I can see

12:37.090 --> 12:39.860
that you're passionate
about this case...
This isn't about the case!

12:41.228 --> 12:43.864
Why did you even
let me go to FLETC?

12:45.732 --> 12:47.067
You never wanted me
to be an agent.

12:47.200 --> 12:48.836
That's not true.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.438
You tried to talk me out of it,

12:51.571 --> 12:53.540
and you didn't tell anyone
when I got in.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.909
Because you're my dad,
I had to work twice as hard

12:56.043 --> 12:58.178
as everyone else to prove
I even deserved that spot.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.447
All I want to do
is show that I can do this.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.515
You'll get your chance, Kayla.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.783
Will I, Dad?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.020
Or is it Director?

13:15.762 --> 13:17.130
Report to Ms. Hines.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.598
That's an order,

13:18.731 --> 13:20.868
Agent Vance.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.149
Whoa.

13:36.283 --> 13:38.919
Did I just step back
into the '90s?

13:39.052 --> 13:41.721
Yeah, I overheard you guys
talking about your first cases,

13:41.821 --> 13:43.723
so I broke out this bad boy.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.092
Got a little nostalgic?

13:45.225 --> 13:46.759
My very first Dictaphone.

13:46.894 --> 13:50.463
I used him to record all
my cases, including my first.

13:52.099 --> 13:54.334
JIMMY

14:00.340 --> 14:01.942

I-I don't remember,

14:02.075 --> 14:03.643
uh, recording that, so, uh...

14:04.811 --> 14:06.980
Can we keep this between us?

14:07.114 --> 14:08.982
My lips are sealed.
Thank you.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.183
You got the tox screen results?

14:10.317 --> 14:11.618
Yes, yes, um,

14:11.751 --> 14:13.653
Masuda had, uh,
massive levels

14:13.786 --> 14:15.655
of batrachotoxin
in his system.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.157
It's an organic poison

14:17.290 --> 14:19.159
that's found in the coating
of the skin

14:19.292 --> 14:20.793
of the golden
dart frog,

14:20.928 --> 14:22.829
which is native to Colombia.

14:22.963 --> 14:25.532
I'll cross that off
my travel list.
Mm-hmm.

14:25.665 --> 14:27.534
How did the poison end up
in Masuda's body?

14:27.667 --> 14:29.269
He certainly didn't ingest it,

14:29.369 --> 14:30.971
and I combed every
square inch of his body.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.505
I did not find
an injection site,

14:32.639 --> 14:34.441
so, unfortunately,

14:34.541 --> 14:36.176
that is still a mystery.
Not anymore.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.111
My new partner
in crime-solving and I

14:38.211 --> 14:39.947
have been going through
the hundreds

14:40.047 --> 14:41.481
of pieces
of evidence.

14:41.614 --> 14:44.051
As usual, the smallest
had the most to offer.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.286
Must've fallen off Masuda when
the staff tried to save him.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.521
The killer applied
a transdermal patch

14:48.655 --> 14:51.558
called "DMSO"
or dimethyl sulfoxide.

14:51.691 --> 14:54.694
Doctors use it to ferry drugs
into a patient's bloodstream.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.364
Like a nicotine patch?
But much smaller.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.366
And DMSO can
permeate through

14:59.499 --> 15:02.302
surgical gloves and be
completely absorbed

15:02.402 --> 15:03.870
into the skin. Clever.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.738
Doesn't leave a trace.
Good work, Kayla.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.140
All right,
so we're looking for

15:07.240 --> 15:08.875
somebody with
a medical background.

15:09.009 --> 15:11.211
Masuda might've had an enemy
at the hospital after all.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.913
Considering the amount
of poison in Masuda's body

15:14.047 --> 15:16.716
and the speed at which
it was absorbed...

15:16.849 --> 15:18.251
You could determine
when the killer

15:18.385 --> 15:19.686
administered the DMSO patch.

15:19.819 --> 15:22.489
Had to be within
two hours of his death.

15:22.589 --> 15:25.558
Masuda was in surgery by then,

15:25.692 --> 15:28.495
so whoever killed him
wasn't just at the hospital...

15:28.595 --> 15:30.563
They were in the operating room.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.372
Anyone besides these four

15:39.506 --> 15:41.541
enter the OR
before or during surgery?

15:41.674 --> 15:42.875
Not according
to hospital records.

15:43.010 --> 15:43.943
So, one of them
is the killer.

15:44.077 --> 15:45.178
Two nurses,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.014
an anesthesiologist,
and a resident.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.448
Any criminal history?
McAnesthesiologist.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.717
Shoplifted when
she was a minor,

15:50.850 --> 15:53.086
but nothing since then,
and the rest are clean.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.455
But they all
had opportunity.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.057
They work
in close proximity.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.591
Maybe in the heat of surgery,

15:58.725 --> 16:00.060
not too big a stretch
to stick

16:00.193 --> 16:01.761
a patch on Masuda
while he's distracted.

16:01.894 --> 16:03.096
I got something.

16:03.230 --> 16:06.199
Surgical resident
Sierra Krueger.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.735
She looks like an ad
for an energy drink.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.470
Smitty said that Masuda
was dating

16:10.603 --> 16:12.105
a woman who was into
extreme sports.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.473
I mean, could she
be our killer?

16:13.606 --> 16:15.308
Skydiving,
mountain climbing, skiing.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.644
Looks extreme enough to me.
What about motive?

16:17.777 --> 16:20.080
Masuda wanted to end things,
so maybe she wouldn't let him.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.448
Could be a case
of fatal attraction.

16:21.581 --> 16:22.649
Let's bring in the resident.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.553
What did I miss?

16:26.653 --> 16:28.155
I'm gonna go grab,
uh, some snacks.

16:28.288 --> 16:30.423
Oh, can I get a bag
of pretzels?
M&M's.

16:30.557 --> 16:31.591
Peanuts.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.567
How are things
in the lab?

16:40.667 --> 16:43.136
Great. I was dropping off
some lab reports from Kasie.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.672
She's gonna give me
a crash course on ballistics.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.174
Learning so much.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.642
I know how hard it is
being a legacy hire.

16:49.776 --> 16:52.412
You do?
My dad works out of
the Far East office.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.314
He wasn't too thrilled
when I got my badge.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.116
He didn't want you
to be an agent?

16:56.249 --> 16:57.617
Oh, still doesn't.

16:57.750 --> 16:58.818
Every Christmas
we get together,

16:58.951 --> 17:00.353
he tries talking me
into teaching.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.256
Dads can't help themselves.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.692
It's in their DNA
to protect their kids.

17:05.825 --> 17:08.828
So, just give it time.

17:08.961 --> 17:11.631
Director Vance is gonna see
that you can protect yourself.

17:12.932 --> 17:14.267
I can't wait that long.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.936
In the words
of our resident dad,

17:17.036 --> 17:18.805
"Patience, young Padawan."

17:20.173 --> 17:21.441
<i>Yes,</i>

17:21.541 --> 17:24.211
Dr. Masuda and I
were seeing each other.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.546
You neglected to, uh,
tell us that

17:26.679 --> 17:28.515
when we first questioned you.

17:28.648 --> 17:30.183
Because everyone I work with
would've heard

17:30.317 --> 17:32.385
that I slept with the boss.

17:32.519 --> 17:34.521
Besides, we ended it weeks ago.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.189
We?

17:36.323 --> 17:38.891
Okay, he did.

17:39.025 --> 17:41.060
And I admit, I was upset.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.995
Upset enough
to want to kill him?

17:43.130 --> 17:44.497
No.

17:44.631 --> 17:46.733
I loved him.

17:46.866 --> 17:49.636
He just didn't understand
that we were better together.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.238
If we were together,

17:51.371 --> 17:53.540
that surgery yesterday
never would've happened.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.842
Go on.
The patient,

17:55.975 --> 17:59.346
Ethan Geller, he has stage four
terminal spinal cancer.

17:59.479 --> 18:01.248
Best case,
six months to live.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.883
With the operation,
maybe one month more.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.719
But this surgery came with
a huge risk of paralysis,

18:06.853 --> 18:09.222
and the patient didn't think
it was worth the risk.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.923
And what made Geller
change his mind?

18:11.057 --> 18:12.024
I don't know.

18:12.159 --> 18:13.760
Something was off.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.162
And when I recommended he have

18:15.262 --> 18:16.829
a pre-op psych eval,
he freaked out.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.866
He was worried that the surgery
would be delayed.

18:19.999 --> 18:22.369
Said it had to happen on Monday.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.571
He was very specific
about the day, which is...

18:24.704 --> 18:26.005
Weird.
Yes.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.241
But Dr. Masuda

18:28.375 --> 18:30.677
overruled my psych eval request.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.280
Was Geller placed
under anesthesia

18:33.413 --> 18:35.548
before Dr. Masuda
came into the OR?

18:35.682 --> 18:37.617
No. Dr. Masuda

18:37.750 --> 18:39.752
liked to reassure his patients
before they went under.

18:39.886 --> 18:41.721
That makes him a suspect.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.856
First time I heard
bedside manner

18:43.956 --> 18:46.058
getting someone killed.

18:49.396 --> 18:50.597
You're heading out, sir?

18:50.730 --> 18:52.565
Yeah, I have a meeting
with SECNAV.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.604
Did you need something,
Agent Torres?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.906
Well, you know,
I'm heading down to the lab,

19:00.039 --> 19:02.709
the faraway place where you
sent Kayla to, uh, exile.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.979
I understand why you pulled
Kayla from the field.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.115
The case got a little more
complicated than you expected.

19:09.249 --> 19:10.950
No, that's not why.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.819
She disobeyed your order
to stay in the car.

19:12.952 --> 19:15.222
Yeah, but you can't
fault her for that

19:15.322 --> 19:18.057
because, sir, to be frank, I...

19:18.157 --> 19:19.726
I would've done the same thing.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.296
If...

19:23.430 --> 19:25.765
I knew the order
didn't make sense.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.903
But NCIS agents
have to deal with danger.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.773
That's the job.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.476
Point taken.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.144
All right.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.846
You're the field training agent.

19:39.979 --> 19:41.614
Tell me,

19:41.748 --> 19:43.115
is Kayla ready for that?

19:43.250 --> 19:45.918
If we keep handling her
with kid gloves,

19:46.018 --> 19:47.186
she's never gonna be ready.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.989
The real question
here is,

19:50.122 --> 19:51.858
do you want her to be?

19:56.829 --> 19:58.798
Well, I thought
you'd all like to know

19:58.931 --> 20:02.101
that we looked into
Masuda's patient, Ethan Geller.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.304
We found he had $100,000
deposited into his bank account.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.638
Let me guess,

20:05.772 --> 20:07.307
the day after Masuda was killed.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.141
You think Geller was hired
to put the poison patch

20:09.276 --> 20:10.510
on the doctor?

20:10.643 --> 20:12.011
Well, makes sense
why he would suddenly

20:12.144 --> 20:13.513
change his mind
about the surgery.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.348
He needed to get close
to the doctor.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.116
Like, really close.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.818
Were you able
to trace the funds?
No,

20:18.951 --> 20:21.187
but Geller is in recovery.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.489
He just woke up.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.391
Let's go.

20:28.461 --> 20:29.829
Come on, probie.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.664
The director wants you
back in the field.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.838
Ethan Geller's room is at
the end of the hall, 314.

20:38.971 --> 20:40.507
314.
I don't get it.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.742
Why would a dying patient
agree to kill his doctor?

20:42.875 --> 20:44.744
He wouldn't live long enough
to enjoy the money.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.212
NURSE

20:46.346 --> 20:48.214
Code Blue. 314.
Isn't that...

20:48.348 --> 20:50.983
It's Geller.
Code Blue. 314.

20:53.753 --> 20:54.887
Stop! NCIS!

20:58.358 --> 21:00.159
Federal agents!

21:01.728 --> 21:03.029
Stairs!

21:24.784 --> 21:25.785
Kayla!

21:25.918 --> 21:27.954
Over here.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.022
Stay close.

21:41.200 --> 21:42.535
Kayla.
Kayla!

21:43.903 --> 21:44.904
Let her go!
Drop it!

21:45.037 --> 21:46.305
You drop it!
Drop it now!

21:46.439 --> 21:48.608
Stay back!
Drop the gun.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.143
Okay, okay, okay.

21:51.277 --> 21:52.545
Look, I'm doing it
your way.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.813
It's all good.
I'm dropping the gun.

21:53.946 --> 21:55.915
Him, too.
Not a chance.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.117
Forget about him. Listen.
I know you feel trapped,

21:58.250 --> 21:59.552
but you can still
walk out of here.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.388
You just need to let her go.

22:03.556 --> 22:04.457
Let her go!
No!

22:04.591 --> 22:06.225
Go!

22:19.238 --> 22:20.573
KNIGHT
They're setting up roadblocks

22:20.673 --> 22:22.108
over a five-mile radius.

22:22.241 --> 22:24.343
The van didn't have
a license plate,

22:24.477 --> 22:26.479
but Kasie got a make
and model off the tire tracks.

22:26.613 --> 22:28.481
We've got a BOLO out.
No hits yet.

22:28.615 --> 22:30.282
McGee's coordinating
with highway patrol.

22:30.417 --> 22:32.318
Agent Torres,

22:32.452 --> 22:34.587
tell me you found a lead
on our suspect.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.589
We found the kidnapper's badge
in the parking lot.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.290
Only prints were, uh, Kayla's.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.627
She must have pulled that off
of him when, uh...

22:41.828 --> 22:44.196
...when he grabbed her.
Clever girl.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.633
We're running facial rec
on the photo now, sir.

22:47.634 --> 22:49.536
What about the hospital?

22:49.669 --> 22:51.871
Talked to the medical staff,
and nobody recognizes the guy.

22:52.004 --> 22:53.205
Do we know
what he was doing there?

22:53.339 --> 22:54.373
We assume visiting

22:54.507 --> 22:57.009
Masuda's patient,
who's now dead.

22:57.143 --> 22:58.511
He must've come back
to tie up loose ends.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.212
And took Kayla
to escape the hospital.

23:00.346 --> 23:02.882
So what are they doing
with her now?

23:05.652 --> 23:07.620
This is obviously tied up
in Masuda's murder.

23:07.720 --> 23:11.323
We, uh... we go over every piece
of the investigation.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.626
We find out who wanted him dead,

23:13.726 --> 23:15.061
we find out who has Kayla.

23:32.745 --> 23:34.681
Just find her.

23:34.814 --> 23:36.883
Sir.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.933
Don't bother.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.435
You're not getting
out of those.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.574
So, um, let's
have a chat.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.876
I ask questions.

24:04.010 --> 24:06.278
You answer.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.751
I don't like
your answers,

24:11.884 --> 24:13.620
you die.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.354
Deal?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.556
Pedro, don't.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.558
Shh! Don't what?!

24:18.691 --> 24:21.728
Isaac? You don't
want me to hurt her?

24:23.395 --> 24:25.464
He doesn't want me
to hurt you.

24:25.598 --> 24:28.067
So let me ask again.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.436
Do we have a deal?

24:32.238 --> 24:33.873
Good.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.812
Let's start simple.

24:39.946 --> 24:42.148
What is your name?

24:44.416 --> 24:47.486
Maddie. Maddie Adams.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.221
That wasn't so hard, was it?

24:49.321 --> 24:53.292
Now, what does
NCIS know

24:53.425 --> 24:55.762
about me?
I don't know.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.830
I swear. I'm new.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.498
I finished my training
last week.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.333
They don't tell me anything.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.803
Okay.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.607
Okay.

25:10.009 --> 25:12.011
Well, that makes you
kind of useless,

25:12.144 --> 25:13.012
doesn't it?

25:13.145 --> 25:14.246
Pedro, wait.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.481
She must know something.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.983
She just said she didn't.
She was

25:17.116 --> 25:18.317
at the hospital
with the other agents.

25:18.450 --> 25:19.952
She could have heard something.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.023
MAN
Pedro, need you out here.

25:29.796 --> 25:31.964
I'm coming.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.966
You keep an eye on her
while I'm gone.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.940
Thank you.

25:41.941 --> 25:43.843
I'm not sure
I did you any favors.

25:43.976 --> 25:45.678
He's not done with you yet.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.848
<i>I heard you got a hit</i>

25:48.981 --> 25:50.016
off facial rec.

25:50.149 --> 25:52.719
Pedro Rodriguez.
He's a lieutenant

25:52.852 --> 25:54.386
for the Emberá Cartel.
The Emberá were one

25:54.520 --> 25:56.623
of the biggest drug syndicates
in South America.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.958
Came out of Colombia
in the '90s.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.392
Infamous for recruiting minors,
killing police,

26:00.526 --> 26:02.161
wiping out their competition.

26:02.294 --> 26:03.896
Their weapon of
choice was poison

26:04.030 --> 26:05.832
from the golden dart frog.
So our doctor was killed

26:05.965 --> 26:08.000
by the cartel.
Who's running it now?

26:08.134 --> 26:10.302
José Ortiz,
goes by the name "El Santo,"

26:10.402 --> 26:12.538
"The Saint,"
but he's a leader-in-exile.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.141
He was caught by the FBI
during a sting operation.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.009
El Santo was sentenced
to life in prison.

26:17.143 --> 26:19.746
That was four years ago, and
they've been silent ever since.

26:19.879 --> 26:21.513
So, what brought them out
of the shadows?

26:21.648 --> 26:23.582
Got to have something
to do with Dr. Masuda.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.017
It does.

26:25.151 --> 26:26.352
That was the deputy director

26:26.485 --> 26:27.920
at the Federal Bureau
of Prisons.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.356
Masuda was planning
on visiting him next week.

26:30.489 --> 26:33.259
So our dead surgeon worked
for the cartel?
Well, not exactly.

26:33.392 --> 26:35.662
He was going in to give El Santo
a second opinion

26:35.762 --> 26:37.496
on a surgical procedure
he needed.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.565
For what?
Peripheral nerve damage.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.901
So why kill the doctor
who's gonna operate on you?

26:42.034 --> 26:43.836
Because Masuda wasn't scheduled
to operate.

26:43.936 --> 26:45.337
Right.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.840
He was the second opinion.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.275
Who gave the first?

26:54.346 --> 26:55.748
You visited José Ortiz,

26:55.882 --> 26:57.784
also known as El Santo,
last week at the prison,

26:57.917 --> 26:59.686
recommended
that he have surgery.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.921
Doctor-patient confidentiality
prevents me from discussing...

27:02.054 --> 27:04.090
Mc
Your supervisor,
Dr. Masuda,

27:04.223 --> 27:05.692
checked El Santo's
medical records,

27:05.792 --> 27:07.426
and he came to a
different conclusion.

27:07.559 --> 27:10.396
He didn't think that
El Santo needed surgery.

27:10.529 --> 27:12.631
I wasn't aware of that,

27:12.765 --> 27:15.067
but doctors often
have differing opinions.

27:15.201 --> 27:16.535
We're not getting anywhere.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.138
Push any harder,
and he'll lawyer up.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.307
Dr. Masuda disagreed
with your medical opinion.

27:21.440 --> 27:22.975
I don't like
what you're insinuating.

27:23.109 --> 27:24.711
And two days later, he's dead.

27:24.811 --> 27:27.379
You have to
admit that's...

27:27.479 --> 27:29.615
Director?

27:30.783 --> 27:33.986
Dr. Roth, I don't
have time to waste.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.988
Good. Because I've got
back-to-back surgeries

27:36.122 --> 27:37.589
to get ready for.

27:39.926 --> 27:41.994
El Santo's men have my daughter.

27:42.128 --> 27:44.731
I need you to tell me
everything you know about them.

27:46.632 --> 27:49.235
Like I said, I, uh...

27:49.335 --> 27:51.003
can't talk about a patient
without violating...

27:51.137 --> 27:52.805
They've got my daughter!

27:52.939 --> 27:54.240
I don't give a damn

27:54.340 --> 27:56.909
about your patient
confidentiality!

28:08.120 --> 28:09.488
She's my baby.

28:13.826 --> 28:16.929
I am supposed to keep her safe.

28:22.969 --> 28:25.772
Someone contacted me last month.

28:25.872 --> 28:29.208
Said he was El Santo's
right-hand man.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.277
This the guy?

28:31.377 --> 28:35.614
He blackmailed me.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.885
You see, I...
I have a small problem.

28:39.018 --> 28:41.620
We saw the check that you wrote
to the five-star rehab center.

28:43.289 --> 28:44.390
What are you using?

28:45.892 --> 28:47.559
Cocaine.

28:47.693 --> 28:51.831
My dealer... I found out
he works for El Santo.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.901
Then he shows up on my doorstep.

28:55.034 --> 28:58.304
Threatens to ruin my career,
everything I worked for,

28:58.404 --> 29:01.340
if I don't do what he wants.

29:01.473 --> 29:02.809
And what did he want?

29:04.811 --> 29:07.479
To set up a fake surgery
at my hospital.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.181
Before El Santo

29:09.315 --> 29:12.985
even made it to the OR,
they were gonna get him out.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.753
It's a jailbreak.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.990
Can't bust a convict out
of supermax.

29:18.090 --> 29:19.892
But getting him out
of a low-security hospital--

29:20.026 --> 29:21.427
piece of cake.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.429
Until the deputy director
called Masuda in

29:23.562 --> 29:25.331
for a second opinion.
That's what got you scared.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.166
And then you warned
El Santo's people

29:27.266 --> 29:29.068
that Masuda was gonna
deny the surgery.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.769
I didn't know they'd kill him.

29:30.903 --> 29:32.704
How do I find
El Santo's men?

29:32.839 --> 29:34.874
I-I don't know.
They always contacted me.

29:37.276 --> 29:40.579
I swear. I don't know.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.250
<i>Can I get some water?</i>

29:53.425 --> 29:54.894
Thank you.

29:56.128 --> 29:58.430
You know,
you're not like Pedro.

30:02.969 --> 30:05.204
I used to make those
when I was a kid.

30:05.304 --> 30:06.973
All rainbow colors.

30:07.106 --> 30:09.741
I'd make my dad wear them.

30:09.876 --> 30:12.945
Thought I'd keep him safe.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.783
That's what my daughter says.

30:18.784 --> 30:20.819
She did a great job.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.956
I could never get mine
to look that neat.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.757
What's her name?

30:25.892 --> 30:27.259
Sophia.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.828
It's a beautiful name.

30:29.962 --> 30:31.830
How old is she?

30:31.964 --> 30:33.832
Eight.

30:33.966 --> 30:36.502
She just had a birthday yesterday.

30:36.635 --> 30:38.470
The prison transport has been

30:38.604 --> 30:40.973
cancelled. El Santo's surgery
has been called off.

30:41.107 --> 30:43.142
Why?
Why?

30:45.177 --> 30:47.146
Because this little bitch lied.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.982
NCIS must have known
more than what she told us.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.418
And now...

30:53.485 --> 30:54.954
...I'm gonna make her pay.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.324
I swear I don't know
what you're talking about.

30:58.457 --> 31:01.593
I've never even heard
of this El Santo.

31:01.693 --> 31:02.761
Pedro, she might be telling...

31:02.861 --> 31:04.263
How about Kayla Vance?

31:07.333 --> 31:08.667
Do you know that name?

31:08.800 --> 31:10.836
Huh?!

31:10.970 --> 31:14.306
Daniel found it in the van
before he dumped it.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.375
I told you she lied.

31:16.508 --> 31:18.677
Why?
He was threatening to kill me.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.479
I swear, that's
the only reason.

31:20.612 --> 31:21.981
I'm nobody.

31:23.515 --> 31:24.850
What are you doing?
She went out of her way

31:24.984 --> 31:26.953
to hide her name.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.956
You may be a nobody,

31:30.056 --> 31:31.823
but your father's the director

31:31.958 --> 31:33.559
of NCIS.

31:43.569 --> 31:44.836
They won't talk

31:44.971 --> 31:46.305
to anybody but you.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.040
Still working on a trace.

31:48.174 --> 31:49.508
Let's hear it.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.510
Pedro Rodriguez.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.579
Director Leon Vance.

31:53.712 --> 31:56.382
Looks like
we've both done our homework.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.584
You have one
of our agents.
I have to admit

31:58.717 --> 32:01.853
I was upset when you cancelled
the prison transport.

32:01.988 --> 32:05.591
My boss is
a very frightening man.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.693
I knew he would not be happy.

32:07.826 --> 32:10.696
I don't give a damn
about El Santo's feelings.

32:13.899 --> 32:17.669
But you do care
about your daughter's.

32:21.407 --> 32:22.874
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

32:23.009 --> 32:25.411
Yes?

32:25.544 --> 32:26.745
Unlike you,

32:26.878 --> 32:28.414
I care very much
about El Santo's feelings.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.418
But I think he will enjoy
the creative solution

32:32.551 --> 32:34.453
that I came up with.

32:35.754 --> 32:39.625
A prisoner exchange--
your daughter for my boss.

32:40.892 --> 32:42.028
You want me
to what?

32:42.128 --> 32:43.629
You want me to walk El Santo

32:43.762 --> 32:45.431
out of his
maximum security cell?

32:45.564 --> 32:49.101
If anyone can do it,
it's the director of NCIS.

32:49.235 --> 32:51.303
The United States government
does not do prisoner exchanges

32:51.437 --> 32:53.039
with criminals.

32:53.139 --> 32:55.707
Then you'll have
to get creative.

32:55.807 --> 32:59.378
You have exactly
three hours from now,

32:59.478 --> 33:03.949
or the next time
you see your daughter,

33:04.083 --> 33:07.386
she'll have a bullet
in her head.

33:09.121 --> 33:11.557
Kayla, I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

33:11.657 --> 33:12.824
Shh, shh, shh.
Kayla, you're gonna...

33:26.105 --> 33:27.773
They used a public VPN.

33:27.906 --> 33:29.475
We couldn't trace the link.
What do you want to do?

33:29.608 --> 33:31.343
Whatever it takes
to get my daughter back. Okay.

33:31.477 --> 33:34.080
I'll contact

33:34.180 --> 33:35.481
the deputy director
of prison.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.350
He will answer
to a discreet request

33:38.484 --> 33:40.786
from the director of NCIS.

33:40.919 --> 33:42.254
Parker...
We can use back channels

33:42.354 --> 33:44.356
to have El Santo released

33:44.490 --> 33:46.625
into our custody. Okay.
Stop. Stop right there.

33:46.758 --> 33:49.128
We caught him once before.
We can catch him again.

33:49.261 --> 33:51.297
Kayla's one of ours.

33:51.430 --> 33:53.499
Thank you.

33:53.632 --> 33:55.334
But I don't trust that
that son of a bitch

33:55.467 --> 33:56.635
will hold up his end
of the bargain.

33:56.768 --> 33:58.270
We have to find another way.

34:01.006 --> 34:03.475
FBI sent over a list
of El Santo's distribution cells

34:03.609 --> 34:05.477
and all known associates.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.045
His operation stretches
all across the country.

34:07.179 --> 34:08.680
We're concentrating

34:08.814 --> 34:11.150
on the cells in D.C.
We got Knight and Torres working

34:11.283 --> 34:12.651
with local LEOs
to start a search.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.786
That's-that's gonna
take too long.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.888
Maybe not.

34:17.022 --> 34:17.989
Kasie's got something.

34:18.124 --> 34:20.459
<i>As noted,</i>

34:20.559 --> 34:23.529
there are no fingerprints
on the hospital badge. However,

34:23.662 --> 34:26.798
I was able to lift
trace amounts of PGMs,

34:26.898 --> 34:29.235
also known
as Platinum Group Metals.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.137
They're highly durable metals
with catalytic properties.

34:31.237 --> 34:32.738
Meaning?

34:32.871 --> 34:35.407
Very rare and very expensive.
So, not easy to find.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.677
Especially in this
combination of metals.

34:38.810 --> 34:40.979
The only place they'd
exist together would be

34:41.079 --> 34:42.548
a platinum recycling center.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.816
Pedro must've spent a lot
of time near one for it

34:44.916 --> 34:46.485
to leave residue
on the badge.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.154
How many recycling centers
are in that area there?

34:48.254 --> 34:51.022
Just the one.
What do you think,
Director?

34:51.157 --> 34:53.492
Looks like a place El Santo's
men could be keeping her.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.194
They could be holding Kayla
in any of these buildings.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.095
There's no way we can go
in there without alerting them.

34:57.229 --> 34:58.897
Don't need to.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.400
I pulled satellite imagery
of the area for the past

35:01.533 --> 35:03.402
36 hours.
We already know

35:03.535 --> 35:04.836
they used a Ford-model
black van.

35:04.936 --> 35:08.006
If we run it through
A.I. object recognition...

35:08.106 --> 35:09.441
Gotcha.

35:09.575 --> 35:10.942
<i>There's a chain-link fence</i>

35:11.076 --> 35:12.778
surrounding the
entire property.

35:12.911 --> 35:14.446
Security cams
in every corner.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.549
Single entrance here.
Gate, guards posted out front.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.084
Good news is
they are not expecting us.

35:19.218 --> 35:21.587
We're going in blind,
so be prepared for the worst.

35:34.733 --> 35:36.868
Director?

35:36.968 --> 35:38.437
You sure?

35:41.373 --> 35:43.242
Do you remember

35:43.375 --> 35:45.444
when your kids first started
walking, Agent McGee?

35:47.279 --> 35:51.583
Kayla had just turned one.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.886
I came home from work,
and there she was.

35:56.288 --> 35:58.324
My little girl.

35:59.425 --> 36:01.427
She took one step toward me

36:01.560 --> 36:03.795
and then another,

36:03.929 --> 36:08.567
and I caught her on the last one
just before she could fall.

36:12.338 --> 36:14.840
And I promised myself then

36:14.973 --> 36:18.610
that I would never let her fall.

36:21.847 --> 36:23.749
This is my daughter.

36:23.849 --> 36:26.117
It's my little girl.

36:27.253 --> 36:28.820
So you can think twice

36:28.954 --> 36:30.922
if you're gonna ask me
to sit this one out.

36:33.325 --> 36:34.593
All right, let's move.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.503
Turn around.
We're closed.

36:44.636 --> 36:46.305
I got a delivery scheduled.
You're in the wrong place, pal.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.207
Oh, man. That damn dispatch.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.209
That's the second time
this month they made a mistake.

36:51.343 --> 36:53.512
Last time, they sent me
to the wrong address.

36:53.645 --> 36:56.282
I get there, I finish unloading,
and then I see it.

36:56.382 --> 36:59.150
Clipboard says one thing,
cargo slip says another.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.387
Hey, get back in the truck!
Hey, keep your shirt on.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.721
I'll check the cargo slip.

37:02.854 --> 37:04.656
I'll get it sorted out.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.692
I said get back
in the truck. Whoa!

37:11.630 --> 37:14.633
Yup, definitely the right place.

37:23.208 --> 37:26.678
Daniel, give me an update.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.384
Something is wrong.

37:32.518 --> 37:33.885
Untie her.

37:34.019 --> 37:36.021
We're moving out.
Daniel?

37:36.154 --> 37:38.023
Daniel?! What is going on?

37:38.156 --> 37:40.892
Isaac? Be careful.

37:41.026 --> 37:43.895
You can't trust him.
He's gonna get you killed.
Shut up.

37:46.031 --> 37:47.533
Let's go. Time's up!

37:47.666 --> 37:50.235
You got that right.
Drop it! It's over.

37:52.037 --> 37:54.005
Drop the gun!

37:56.675 --> 37:58.610
Oh.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.716
Keep away!

38:04.850 --> 38:05.951
I'll-I'll...
I'll kill her.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.186
Let her go!

38:11.056 --> 38:12.924
Isaac.

38:13.058 --> 38:14.460
I know you feel trapped.

38:16.127 --> 38:17.295
But you can walk out of here.

38:17.429 --> 38:18.730
All you have to do
is let me go.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.799
Just shut up!

38:20.932 --> 38:22.568
I got to think.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.771
Then think about Sophia.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.640
If you do this, you'll never
see your daughter again.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.320
Put it down slow.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.955
Slow.

38:47.125 --> 38:48.894
Kayla?

38:48.994 --> 38:51.763
Are you okay?
I'm good. I'm fine.

38:51.897 --> 38:52.831
Turn around.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.500
Kayla. Kayla.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.569
Oh, my God.

38:57.669 --> 39:00.839
You okay?
Mm-hmm.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.945
<i>That's a hell of a first case,</i>

39:07.078 --> 39:09.781
Kayla.
Oh, easily one
of the craziest I've ever heard.

39:09.915 --> 39:11.650
Not every new agent
could get themselves

39:11.783 --> 39:13.118
out of that situation.

39:15.587 --> 39:18.289
You have a knack for
hostage negotiation.

39:18.424 --> 39:20.759
You should consider
joining REACT.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.928
Baby steps. I don't want
to give my dad a heart attack.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.663
All right, all right.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.098
Don't let their compliments get
to your head, probie.

39:27.198 --> 39:28.934
I'm your training agent.

39:29.034 --> 39:32.704
And you want a passing grade,
you want me to be impressed.

39:32.838 --> 39:34.640
How do I do that?
Case report.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.508
My desk first thing.

39:36.642 --> 39:37.776
Mc
Hey, you wanted the, uh,

39:37.876 --> 39:38.844
full probie experience, Kayla.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.278
Oh, good luck.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.680
Took me 16 hours

39:41.813 --> 39:43.449
to get my first
case report right.

39:43.549 --> 39:46.051
Hey, Parker, you never finished
that thing about the zebra.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.353
All right, okay, there's
no time like the present.

39:48.487 --> 39:52.123
Now, you all heard about the
zebras storming the winery.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.694
Turns out that the winery was
a front for a PCP

39:55.827 --> 39:58.964
distribution center, and that's
what the zebras were after.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.632
They were hooked on PCP?

40:00.732 --> 40:03.068
Hang on. Parker.

40:03.201 --> 40:04.736
We're never gonna hear the end
of this story.

40:04.870 --> 40:06.738
All right, yeah, but
I'm-I'm in some...

40:06.872 --> 40:08.173
I'm right in the
middle of something.

40:08.306 --> 40:09.708
Yeah, it's important. Okay.

40:09.841 --> 40:12.177
<i>Thought I'd find you out here.</i>

40:20.018 --> 40:21.386
You were right.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.857
I never wanted you
to follow in my footsteps.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.861
I thought you might
change your mind

40:29.995 --> 40:31.663
once you went through FLETC.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.733
I'm not gonna
change my mind.

40:34.866 --> 40:37.335
I know.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.106
Which is why I decided to assign
you to another field office.

40:45.611 --> 40:47.679
Okay.

40:51.717 --> 40:55.954
You're on your way to becoming
an excellent NCIS agent, Kayla.

40:56.087 --> 40:59.357
Can't do that with me
looking over your shoulder.

41:01.259 --> 41:03.394
Thank you.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.475
You better go
do me proud out there.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.478
You bet I will.
