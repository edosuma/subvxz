there was some blood.

I mention Rufus' name in InStyle.

- Fuck Jimmy Kimmel.

06:26.511 --> 06:27.511
Jimmy Kimmel's a prick.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.555

06:29.639 --> 06:31.223
He's a phony prick.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.893
He and I were running buddies
back in the day.

That was before
I got kicked off of Melrose Place.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.566

I had to move into that motel on Wilcox.

talk about, though?

06:58.376 --> 07:01.754

"How you feeling?" "Pretty good."

- So, what's really bothering you, E?

07:18.271 --> 07:21.816

or is this maybe a Kristen issue?

later today. That's all.

you're out of commission for two weeks.

07:37.833 --> 07:38.958
I can't have that.

(LAUGHING) Broken up and still
pussy-whipped. That's just sad.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.922
These guys are right.
You lose control around that girl.

07:45.006 --> 07:48.300
You guys don't know dick.
You never had a relationship.

07:48.385 --> 07:51.595
You never ended one. The only person
you've ever loved is yourself.

07:51.680 --> 07:52.847
What's not to love?

07:52.931 --> 07:56.100

- Bullshit!

What about Becky Serrano in junior high?
I remember, she was crying by the lockers.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.992
I never broke up with Becky.
I liked her too much for that.

08:13.076 --> 08:16.495
No, you just started banging
Meredith Tierney at the same time.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.122
Yeah. I liked her, too.

SHAUNA: You couldn't call me?
ERIC: It happened last night.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.640
There's a right way to do things
and a wrong way to do things.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.977
- And which one was this?
- Don't make a plan without consulting me.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.605
You don't circumvent the system.
There are consequences.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.565
TURTLE: Is he gonna get killed
for going on Kimmel?

08:44.649 --> 08:47.401
- You might get killed for being an asshole.
- Shauna.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.820
If you want to do Kimmel, come to me.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.989
I'm your publicist. That's what I'm here for,
and that's what I do.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.575
I gave him the idea for The Man Show.
He loves my ass.

08:54.659 --> 08:58.037
- Come here with that neck.
- Cut that shit out. Look, I'm serious.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.456
You don't want to piss off Letterman
or Leno.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.585
- You don't want to piss off Shauna.
- I think she's looks kind of sexy, pissed.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.214
I am. But those guys
are vindictive pricks. Here, try this on.

09:08.465 --> 09:12.509
- I'm sorry, okay? Do you forgive me?
- Have you ever even seen the show?

09:12.594 --> 09:14.220
- What? Jimmy Kimmel?
- Yeah.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.180
I don't know. Maybe. What's the difference?

09:16.264 --> 09:18.766
He's not asking me to watch it.
He's asking to be on it.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.559
DRAMA: I think he should go with Byblos.

09:20.644 --> 09:23.062
If he decides later he doesn't like it,
I'll take it.

09:23.146 --> 09:24.730
Have to let the shoulders out a bit.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.567
You should get a couple suits to choose
from, so you're not locked into one.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.445
- He doesn't wear a couple suits.
- He does now.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.781
He gets them for free, you cheap fuck.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.116
- That's a keeper.
- Wow, nice.

09:36.201 --> 09:37.409
Hello.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.913
- You should get me on a talk show. I'd kill.
- I'll get you on Springer.

09:40.997 --> 09:43.499
Fat, little horny fucks,
and the women that despise them.

09:43.583 --> 09:44.833
SHAUNA: What are you laughing at?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.711
Maybe I'll get you on Montel
with Don Swayze...

09:47.796 --> 09:50.256
Joey Travolta
and the other retarded star siblings.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.092
- That's funny.
- Kimmel's girl just called.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.302
They're calling back in an hour
to do the pre-interview.

09:55.387 --> 09:56.595
You're gonna have to do that, E.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.640
It's gonna get my head screwed up.
I gotta keep my spontaneity.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.309
Fuck spontaneity.
Well-dressed, well-prepared.

10:02.394 --> 10:03.769
That's what makes you a star.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.146
You wanna write that down for me
in case I forget?

10:06.231 --> 10:08.065
Yeah. Try this one on, all right?

10:09.776 --> 10:11.527
ERIC: Yeah, that could be funny.

10:11.611 --> 10:14.655
The script pages got all switched.
The director got confused.

10:14.739 --> 10:17.241
- Everybody really laughed about it.
- Boring.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.953
Then they fixed it.
Yeah, I guess you had to be there.

10:21.037 --> 10:22.288
What else?

10:22.372 --> 10:26.208
Tell him about that stoned-out craft
service girl who blew me after lunch.

10:26.293 --> 10:28.460
- Why don't you stop it, Drama?
- DRAMA: I'm trying to help.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.254
You're not helping.
You're embarrassing me.

10:30.338 --> 10:34.425
I was on Arsenio. It never aired.
'Cause he got cancelled, but I was good.

10:35.552 --> 10:39.096
Uh, let's see. Here's something. I got one.

10:39.180 --> 10:42.850
Vince went to the High School
of Performing Arts where they shot Fame.

10:42.934 --> 10:47.479
But he never saw the movie or the TV Show.
I always found that kind of funny.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.025
Maybe not funny, but ironic at least.
I don't know.

10:51.609 --> 10:52.609
Hold on a second.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.321
You want to do this? You're so funny.
This is your interview.

10:55.405 --> 10:57.865
I've never done this before.
I don't know what to say.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.700
You're doing a good job.

11:00.452 --> 11:04.246
Yeah. Vince actually...
He's not available right now.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.791
I'll talk to him
and see if we can come up with something.

11:07.876 --> 11:10.627
I'll call you later, okay? Thank you.

11:11.254 --> 11:15.257
Man, you're really bombing, bro.
Maybe we should just cancel.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.845
Just don't show. That'll really fuck Kimmel.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.055
You'd never cancel.

11:21.139 --> 11:23.974
Why would I cancel
when it's so much fun to watch him freak?

11:24.059 --> 11:27.144
You're gonna freak.
Sara Foster is also on the show tonight.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.209
You think she'll bring other hotties
with her?

I never called her again.

But that's not breaking up.

What do you mean, what am I...
I'm not planning anything.

- What I say when I see her is what I'll say.
- What about Kristen, E?

12:17.320 --> 12:20.447
Same thing. Whatever I say when I see her
is what I'll say.

They had a one-night stand and
he never called her. Can you believe that?

I can. Vince has to break up with girls
before it gets serious.

That way he can't get hurt.

He has major intimacy issues.

you're thinking of buying a house.

Not exactly.

and you're all gonna live in it.

we weren't going to fight about this.

Would that be worth something?

22:48.909 --> 22:51.077
It's a mystery.
I wouldn't want to give it away.

22:51.162 --> 22:53.663
I'm not here to plug anything.
I'm here to see you.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.553
So, we have a clip of the film.
And you need to set the clip up?

23:08.637 --> 23:10.180
Forget about the clip.

23:10.264 --> 23:12.098
All right, we'll forget about the clip.

What would you like to talk about then?
I'll let you decide.

23:29.033 --> 23:32.452
Well, why don't we talk about my brother?
He's really pissed.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.746
He says you dissed him,
you owe him a phone call.

23:34.830 --> 23:37.373
- So you know what happened?
- I know what he told me.

23:37.458 --> 23:39.751
I can't believe
he's not talking about the movie.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.587

Home Video Solutions into this?

23:45.382 --> 23:46.925
Would you shut up and listen?

23:47.009 --> 23:48.551
What did he tell you?

23:48.636 --> 23:52.680
He said that when he hit a rough patch,
you kind of bailed on him...

23:53.432 --> 23:55.141
and you never called him again.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.351

JIMMY: He did not... He said I bailed on him?

23:59.271 --> 24:02.023
I was like a bounty hunter
trying to get a hold of him.

24:02.108 --> 24:05.110
I called his house. I looked for his address.

24:05.486 --> 24:06.986
He owes me a call.

24:07.279 --> 24:08.738
I think he might be right.

24:08.823 --> 24:10.365
He's backstage.

Bring him out.
Because I'd love to clear this up.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.291
Is he around? Is he really backstage?

24:20.376 --> 24:23.044

JIMMY: You guys are living together now?

25:19.101 --> 25:21.686
It's a bachelor pad?
What's the setup over there?

25:21.770 --> 25:24.606
- Tell them about the home theater.
- Yeah.

25:25.024 --> 25:28.860
So, we have this really great house.
And it's got everything.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.528
- Except...
- Except...

25:31.197 --> 25:32.488
a home theater.
