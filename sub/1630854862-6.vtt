00:58.976 --> 01:02.437
<i>Mrs. Durette plans to press charges,
pending an investigation.</i>

01:03.105 --> 01:05.649
<i>Meanwhile,
the gaping sinkhole that opened up</i>

01:05.649 --> 01:10.028
<i>in the 17th block of Spruce Street
suggests severe negligence</i>

01:10.028 --> 01:12.865
<i>in one of Philadelphia's
most affluent neighborhoods.</i>

01:12.865 --> 01:16.869
<i>Despite scrutiny from homeowners
who fear they may be displaced,</i>

01:16.869 --> 01:20.706
<i>the mayor and the Streets Department
are in fact having talks</i>

01:20.706 --> 01:26.545
<i>about a potential evacuation order which
could be issued in the next few weeks.</i>

01:27.379 --> 01:31.008
<i>76ers make a big trade today.
We'll hear all about that from Todd.</i>

01:31.008 --> 01:32.676
<i>Coming up after the break...</i>

02:08.419 --> 02:09.755
It's time to wake up.

02:11.340 --> 02:13.050
Jericho's party begins in an hour.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.135
You should be downstairs
to greet your guests.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.637
They're not my guests.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.056
And I will not be going down there.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.140
Yes, you will.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.477
You wouldn't want people to think
you're an uninvolved mother.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.315
You are in over your head, Leanne.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.318
No one's gonna set foot in this house
with that hole out there.

02:31.318 --> 02:32.444
Do I look worried?

02:34.613 --> 02:36.740
This party will go ahead
with or without you.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.451
But I'd really like you to be there.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.161
It's a family event.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.171
Eight. Eight eyes.

02:51.171 --> 02:55.133
Now, they've been known
to give humans the creepy-crawlies,

02:55.133 --> 02:57.511
but they are harmless.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.889
Only attacking
if somebody hurts them first.

03:01.765 --> 03:04.393
Wha-- One more time?

03:04.393 --> 03:05.561
Please, no.

03:06.144 --> 03:11.984
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
Went up the waterspout</i>

03:12.776 --> 03:17.990
<i>Down came the rain
And washed the spider out</i>

03:18.866 --> 03:23.954
<i>Out came the sun
And dried up all the rain...</i>

03:23.954 --> 03:25.038
<i>So, the itsy...</i>

03:25.038 --> 03:27.875
I think you've had enough.
Why don't you go and make the rounds?

03:29.793 --> 03:31.378
I don't take orders from you.

03:32.254 --> 03:33.338
I work for her.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.924
She's in charge of me.

03:41.305 --> 03:43.849
This is pitiful.

03:43.849 --> 03:47.102
Where are Dorothy's friends?
I've never seen these people before.

03:47.102 --> 03:52.482
Leanne sends a day-before Evite
to a six-month-late birthday party,

03:52.482 --> 03:55.611
right after an earthquake
splits the street in half.

03:55.611 --> 03:57.821
Can't imagine why nobody showed up.

03:57.821 --> 04:00.824
Poor Dorothy. I bet she hates this.

04:01.825 --> 04:03.202
I hate this.

04:04.119 --> 04:05.787
Did you need help getting dressed?

04:05.787 --> 04:06.997
No.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.750
I'm not giving Leanne
the satisfaction of dressing up.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.879
Oh, God. We were so close, Sean.

04:13.879 --> 04:17.423
We're never gonna get the opportunity
to blindside her like that again.

04:17.423 --> 04:19.885
The cult probably gave up and went home.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.011
I don't know.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.515
They don't seem like the type
to easily quit.

04:24.515 --> 04:25.974
I truly hope so.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.018
Because every moment until then,

04:28.018 --> 04:31.104
she's gonna rub it in my face
that I'm powerless in my own home.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.317
A one-and-a-half birthday party.
What the fuck is this?

04:35.317 --> 04:37.569
She's punishing us, Sean, brutally.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.197
There has to be some way to end this.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.910
Julian. She listens to him.

04:47.246 --> 04:49.498
He won't raise a hand against her.
We've lost him.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.208
Maybe not.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.378
There's a chance we could
get through to him.

04:57.506 --> 04:59.341
Hi. Hi, everyone.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.386
I just wanted to say a quick thank you

05:02.386 --> 05:06.348
to you all for coming to celebrate
Jericho turning one and a half.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.517
I know that it's been a tricky time.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.771
Dorothy, this party is my gift to you.

05:12.771 --> 05:17.067
Due to your hospitalization, we weren't
able to celebrate Jericho turning one.

05:17.067 --> 05:20.070
And I know that you've been busy
planning other things,

05:20.070 --> 05:22.239
so I thought I'd handle this one for you.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.575
I know how much you love parties.

05:25.325 --> 05:29.037
Look, I got you Dorothy from
<i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, your favorite movie.

05:34.293 --> 05:36.211
A child needs stability.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.548
He needs to be shown that he's loved.

05:41.133 --> 05:43.093
And Jericho is very, very loved.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.306
I'm sure that Jude the Animal Dude

05:47.306 --> 05:49.850
has a couple more awesome animals
for everybody.

05:50.767 --> 05:53.478
So, please enjoy this special day.

05:55.314 --> 05:57.774
Oh, Julian. Get the hats.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.693
Can you get the party hats?

05:59.693 --> 06:00.777
Thanks.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.531
Who's ready to see
some awesome creatures, huh?

06:05.365 --> 06:07.492
Hats.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.328
- What are you doing?
- Helping.

06:09.912 --> 06:12.372
Julian, look what she's done to you.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.791
Look what she's done to us.
She's keeping our family hostage.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.793
Lighten up, man. It's a birthday party.

06:16.793 --> 06:19.004
Your ability to compartmentalize
is breathtaking.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.088
Oh, yeah?

06:20.088 --> 06:21.840
Maybe I should start reading the Bible

06:21.840 --> 06:24.510
and inventing stories
about my nanny's magical powers.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.471
That's a much more rational form
of escapism.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.517
You know,
I can't imagine what this is doing to her.

06:32.434 --> 06:36.146
That her husband has gone completely
batshit delusional in her time of need.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.106
Are you kidding me?
You're saying this to me

06:38.106 --> 06:41.068
when you're fucking the person
actively destroying your sister?

06:41.068 --> 06:42.361
You're fucking delusional.

06:42.361 --> 06:43.445
Julian!

06:45.030 --> 06:46.156
Go, brother.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.622
Excuse me, miss.

06:53.622 --> 06:56.500
Have you seen a silly man made of straw?

06:57.167 --> 07:00.587
I seem to have lost him somewhere
along the yellow brick road.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.089
Not now, please.

07:03.590 --> 07:04.591
Fine.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.928
Your party kinda blows.

07:08.804 --> 07:09.930
It's not my party.

07:12.808 --> 07:17.980
Does anyone know what sound a snake makes?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.649
That's right.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.070
We're going to pet Rosie now.

07:25.070 --> 07:26.738
Be very gentle.

07:26.738 --> 07:31.660
We're gonna use two fingers
and go down her scales.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.412
Just like this, see?

07:33.412 --> 07:34.496
Now...

07:35.789 --> 07:39.168
anyone here brave enough
to give her a touch?

07:41.753 --> 07:45.090
So in the wild, Rosie eats mostly birds.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.385
I'm sorry.

07:49.761 --> 07:51.138
She's a bit overtired.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.140
It is day after all.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.474
Sorry.

07:55.058 --> 07:57.227
Everybody say goodbye to Rosie, huh?

08:00.314 --> 08:01.857
Come on. Come.

08:02.399 --> 08:03.442
Jude the Animal Dude?

08:03.942 --> 08:07.070
Control your animals,
or I'll have Sean put them on the grill.

08:09.406 --> 08:12.242
I'm going to get a new dress.
I'll be right back.

09:27.276 --> 09:28.360
You.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.237
I should have known--

09:51.675 --> 09:52.885
Oil. Now.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.472
They send three of you
just to kill one little girl,

09:57.472 --> 09:59.683
when you couldn't do it yourself
the first time.

10:02.144 --> 10:04.313
Do you believe that God still loves you?

10:04.313 --> 10:06.815
We will be the saviors of good.

10:06.815 --> 10:10.068
You'll be martyrs
when we burn your bodies.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.153
That's enough.

10:14.573 --> 10:15.991
I can't feel my leg.

10:15.991 --> 10:18.035
Willow, you need to get the knife.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.204
No, we're just supposed to mark her.

10:20.204 --> 10:22.748
No, we have to finish her now.
She's too volatile.

10:22.748 --> 10:23.916
Where's the rag?

10:25.501 --> 10:26.752
- I have it.
- Come here. Give it.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.170
Will you shut that baby up?

10:30.923 --> 10:32.341
Ash!

11:05.290 --> 11:06.291
<i>Hello?</i>

11:06.291 --> 11:08.460
- Lou.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

11:08.460 --> 11:10.295
There's three of them on the third floor

11:11.755 --> 11:12.923
and a baby.

11:14.591 --> 11:16.260
Bring the others and take care of it.

11:16.844 --> 11:17.845
<i>We're on it.</i>

11:19.346 --> 11:21.265
<i>And they're actually very clean.</i>

11:22.266 --> 11:28.105
They only roll around in the mud
so they can stay cool, because...

11:28.814 --> 11:29.857
Any guesses?

11:30.816 --> 11:32.109
They can't sweat much.

11:33.318 --> 11:36.154
So-- And the pink ones,
they use dirt as suntan lotion

11:36.154 --> 11:38.031
so they don't get sunburned.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.283
Isn't that smart?

11:39.783 --> 11:41.493
What do you think?

11:41.493 --> 11:43.662
- Hey look, you got a piggy hat.
- Hat?

11:43.662 --> 11:45.247
Should we put the hat on Piggy?

11:45.831 --> 11:46.832
I'm not wearing that.

11:47.624 --> 11:49.042
Great, you hate me too.

11:54.590 --> 11:55.924
I could never hate you.

11:56.633 --> 11:57.634
You know that.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.637
You are family, which means I support you

12:00.637 --> 12:04.474
even in the midst of the most idiotic
and destructive phase of your life.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.394
- Even if it's at my expense.
- Yeah, I totally feel supported.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.147
I am the one who needs support, Julian.

12:11.190 --> 12:15.194
Leanne is waging war on my entire life,
and you're on the opposing side.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.778
I'm not on anyone's side.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.033
Okay, I just feel bad for her.

12:21.658 --> 12:23.785
She's not had it easy, Dottie, okay?

12:23.785 --> 12:25.162
Her mom was really shit to her.

12:25.162 --> 12:28.248
Forced her into pageants, made her feel
like she wasn't worth loving.

12:28.957 --> 12:31.960
She sees how you are with Jericho.
She's never had that.

12:33.754 --> 12:34.922
You have no idea.

12:37.174 --> 12:40.219
I covered a pageant circuit once
in my first year.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.930
Some very cruel mothers.

12:45.224 --> 12:48.310
Then you get it.
Leanne is like those kids.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.105
So...

12:54.233 --> 12:55.234
cow or pig?

13:33.647 --> 13:37.985
We photocopied some
of Jericho's first baby photos

13:37.985 --> 13:41.780
so you could remember
all those wonderful moments.

13:55.919 --> 13:57.588
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

13:57.588 --> 13:59.047
This is so beautiful.

14:00.257 --> 14:03.510
Julian, it's cake time.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.015
It's very sweet,
but the Evite said no gifts.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.309
We already have everything that we need.

14:10.309 --> 14:12.060
Don't be silly.

14:12.060 --> 14:15.856
Jericho's aunties could never show up
empty-handed.

14:15.856 --> 14:17.733
Okay. Let's put away the goat.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.611
Time for a new activity soon.

14:21.612 --> 14:23.280
Okay, okay.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.991
Okay, everybody say bye-bye to Leonard.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.746
Okay, we're good. Okay. It's okay.

14:30.746 --> 14:32.789
It's-- Come on.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.168
- Julian, what are you doing?
- Have you seen the candles?

14:36.168 --> 14:37.669
Can't find the fucking candles.

14:38.545 --> 14:41.173
No, I checked that one. I've checked
every box. They're not in there.

14:41.673 --> 14:42.674
Did you order candles?

14:42.674 --> 14:44.927
You must have missed them, okay?
Yes, I ordered candles.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.553
- We have candles.
- It's fine.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.764
Just take it out without them, okay?

14:57.940 --> 14:59.024
Fuck.

15:03.904 --> 15:04.905
Fuck.

15:07.533 --> 15:08.700
Easy, easy.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.954
- Whoa. Whoa. Come on.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.997
- Come on.
- Pick it up, Julian.

15:18.418 --> 15:21.421
Bring it outside. Quickly.

15:24.842 --> 15:26.635
Oh, fuck.

15:27.803 --> 15:28.971
You see what I'm getting at?

15:29.763 --> 15:31.598
What, the fucking goat?

15:32.099 --> 15:33.308
Yes, the fucking goat.

15:33.308 --> 15:35.227
Julian, how are you so blind?

15:35.227 --> 15:36.436
Can you just leave me alone?

15:36.436 --> 15:38.355
I'm trying to save
your son's birthday party.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.024
My dead son's birthday party.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.902
Whatever. The kid's.

15:43.902 --> 15:44.987
I get it.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.781
You're terrified of being alone
with yourself.

15:48.824 --> 15:50.284
So Leanne tells you what to do

15:50.284 --> 15:52.202
and holds your hand
through the incessant misery

15:52.202 --> 15:55.455
so you don't have to be
a functioning human like the rest of us.

15:55.455 --> 15:59.168
But I'm begging you, please, be rational.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.460
Julian.

16:05.174 --> 16:10.345
Okay, everyone, we're getting very close
to a very, very exciting time.

16:10.345 --> 16:15.058
And-- The cake is here,
so everyone's going to sing now.

16:15.058 --> 16:16.226
What, no candles?

16:16.226 --> 16:26.612
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

16:26.612 --> 16:30.449
<i>Happy birthday, dear--</i>

16:30.449 --> 16:31.533
Sing.

16:31.533 --> 16:33.035
<i>Jericho</i>

16:33.535 --> 16:34.578
<i>Happy--</i>

16:50.344 --> 16:51.678
I got him, I got him.

16:54.473 --> 16:59.019
- Sweetie, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

16:59.520 --> 17:00.896
This might get infected.

17:00.896 --> 17:03.607
I have some hydrogen peroxide
in my apartment, so--

17:03.607 --> 17:04.691
I said I'm fine.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.861
Hey, don't be a hero.
Come on. You come with me.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.281
No!

17:18.204 --> 17:19.623
Hold on to the rail, okay?

17:21.208 --> 17:22.876
Oh, sweetie.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.296
Here, let's elevate your leg.

17:27.589 --> 17:31.218
That dog really got you, didn't he?

17:33.720 --> 17:36.557
I just wanted to do something nice
for my family.

17:37.683 --> 17:39.768
Of course.

17:41.061 --> 17:44.022
Well, you just relax.

17:44.022 --> 17:45.524
So lean back.

17:45.524 --> 17:48.402
I'm gonna grab this peroxide and bandages,

17:48.402 --> 17:51.655
and I'll get you all cleaned up
and back to the party.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.366
So just hold still for a minute.

17:56.535 --> 17:58.745
Now, this might sting a little.

18:14.803 --> 18:17.264
Sweetie, you need to sit down.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.020
How do you explain
what's happening out there?

18:23.020 --> 18:25.606
- Oh, boy. Here we go.
- What, you think that's normal?

18:25.606 --> 18:27.774
Can you just give the drama a rest?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.693
Why don't you stop forcing your bullshit
down my throat

18:29.693 --> 18:31.195
and take a look at your fucking self?

18:31.695 --> 18:32.863
What's that supposed to mean?

18:32.863 --> 18:36.158
You'd rather indulge
in your fucking absurd magical thinking

18:36.158 --> 18:37.951
than simply take accountability.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.662
Your faith absolves you of your guilt.

18:40.662 --> 18:42.206
You're so smart, aren't you?

18:42.206 --> 18:44.416
Oh, please. It's Psych 101.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.502
You went to California, Sean.

18:46.502 --> 18:49.588
You chose food and glory over your family.

18:49.588 --> 18:50.672
Deal with it.

18:51.465 --> 18:53.133
You're an asshole and a hypocrite.

18:53.634 --> 18:54.843
Did you just hit me?

18:54.843 --> 18:57.471
You should've been there, Julian!
She called you.

18:57.471 --> 18:59.306
But we're not ready
to talk about that, are we?

18:59.306 --> 19:02.226
And we'll never be ready,
because you can't handle real life.

19:02.226 --> 19:04.520
One inconvenience
and you fall off the wagon.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.271
Look at yourself.

19:06.271 --> 19:08.065
You're an addict with no life.

19:08.065 --> 19:11.068
You're a fucking old man
with a teenage girlfriend

19:11.068 --> 19:14.029
who you're so obsessed with,
you're destroying your fucking family!

19:14.029 --> 19:15.197
You're a fucking loser, man.

19:19.326 --> 19:20.744
Fucking kidding me?

20:02.661 --> 20:06.164
This is the part
where I really let myself have it.

20:09.543 --> 20:15.799
I just don't understand
why you deserve all this extravagance.

20:15.799 --> 20:17.509
I don't understand

20:18.093 --> 20:23.640
why you get to be reunited with him!

20:28.353 --> 20:33.275
You have become a symbol of vice

20:34.860 --> 20:36.820
and darkness.

20:37.946 --> 20:44.578
But today,
God gives us the lesson of humility.

20:47.247 --> 20:51.084
You think you are in control, sweetie,

20:52.294 --> 20:55.297
but you are not!

20:56.882 --> 20:59.218
But it's not our place to understand.

21:01.637 --> 21:04.014
It's our place to serve.

21:13.232 --> 21:15.817
- Fucking coward!
- You insufferable prick!

21:30.082 --> 21:32.292
It's--
Think it's coming from the basement.

21:33.794 --> 21:34.878
Someone's lit a fire.

21:40.926 --> 21:43.428
Julian, let it happen!

21:44.179 --> 21:45.347
Julian, wait, stop!

21:45.347 --> 21:47.683
- Let it happen!
- I'm not letting her die!

21:47.683 --> 21:50.227
Julian, don't do this! Julian!

21:52.396 --> 21:53.438
Leanne!

21:59.444 --> 22:00.445
Leanne!

22:45.824 --> 22:46.950
What happened?

22:50.412 --> 22:51.413
Call 911.

23:07.221 --> 23:08.972
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

23:36.458 --> 23:40.504
I had no idea, I swear.

23:41.004 --> 23:43.882
I've known her for years.

23:44.466 --> 23:48.762
I couldn't possibly have imagined
that she was from a cult.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.266
I'm ashamed I didn't see it.

23:52.266 --> 23:54.184
No, it doesn't matter.

23:55.811 --> 23:58.105
You two have been so kind to me.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.315
I needed that.

24:01.191 --> 24:04.736
You've made incredible progress, Dorothy.

24:05.237 --> 24:08.740
You're one of the fiercest patients
I've ever had,

24:10.450 --> 24:15.914
but I do think it's time
that I conclude my time here.

24:19.209 --> 24:20.502
I understand.

24:22.462 --> 24:26.300
We had a cult member living in our
house. They still couldn't get her.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.093
But did you see Bev's face, Julian?

24:28.093 --> 24:29.511
That's not normal.

24:29.511 --> 24:30.846
You're right.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.598
I don't know if we can go on like this.

24:42.274 --> 24:44.193
I shouldn't have said those things
to you, man.

24:47.154 --> 24:50.324
I shouldn't have slapped you.

24:53.160 --> 24:54.161
We're brothers.

24:57.039 --> 24:59.291
You know, I could've taken you
if it wasn't for the smoke.

24:59.291 --> 25:00.375
Sure.

25:06.131 --> 25:08.217
We weren't there for Dorothy
when she needed us.

25:11.094 --> 25:12.346
We hid everything from her.

25:16.975 --> 25:18.143
Doesn't have to be this way.

25:18.143 --> 25:19.561
You coming in, Juju?

25:34.993 --> 25:37.746
And I don't mean to overstep.

25:38.956 --> 25:39.957
What?

25:40.999 --> 25:46.922
Leanne's infatuation with you is deep.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.176
I think she's deluded herself
into believing

25:51.176 --> 25:53.971
that you two are divinely linked.

25:54.555 --> 25:57.724
In a sense, it's her new religion.

25:58.308 --> 25:59.852
I know you feel trapped,

26:00.894 --> 26:07.526
but, Dorothy, broken people will fight
for their faith with everything they have.

26:08.110 --> 26:13.156
Obsessions like this are fundamental
and oftentimes born in early childhood.

26:14.658 --> 26:18.036
Truthfully,
I think she'd rather die than let you go.

27:24.561 --> 27:26.396
- <i>And what's your name?</i>
- <i>Chloe.</i>

27:26.396 --> 27:29.024
<i>Chloe. Well, best of luck to you, Chloe.</i>

27:29.024 --> 27:32.152
<i>Of course we have to thank
all the moms and the aunts,</i>

27:32.152 --> 27:35.906
<i>who traveled from far away
to be with their daughters today,</i>

27:35.906 --> 27:37.866
<i>stitching dresses, painting faces.</i>

27:37.866 --> 27:40.285
<i>I think we have time
to meet one more contestant</i>

27:40.285 --> 27:43.288
<i>who's down here on the end,
twiddling her thumbs.</i>

27:43.288 --> 27:46.750
- <i>What's your name, pretty lady?</i>
- <i>Leanne.</i>

27:46.750 --> 27:49.211
<i>Leanne, very nice to meet you.
Where were you born?</i>

27:49.211 --> 27:50.295
<i>Wisconsin.</i>

27:50.295 --> 27:54.174
<i>Well, why don't you give a big smile
and look right into that lens</i>

27:54.174 --> 27:55.843
<i>for everybody at home in Wisconsin?</i>
