WEBVTT

00:19.228 --> 00:20.395
You gonna get that?

00:22.439 --> 00:25.776
They're selling magazines.
Whole block's getting calls.

00:31.198 --> 00:32.866
Did you get my suit?

00:32.866 --> 00:35.244
They said it's ready.
I'll pick it up on the way home.

00:35.244 --> 00:36.328
Thanks.

00:59.768 --> 01:03.438
That guy, Stan, called again.
I told him you were with a patient.

01:07.693 --> 01:09.236
You got to admire his persistence.

01:15.617 --> 01:19.079
Yeah, I don't know, hon. It's tight.

01:19.663 --> 01:20.998
Does it look tight to you?

01:22.708 --> 01:23.709
You're not looking.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.961
They said they let it out
as much as they could.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.509
Those fucking magazines.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.098
You screwing someone
behind my back, Candy?

01:42.853 --> 01:44.021
Hello?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.441
Hello?

01:54.865 --> 01:55.699
Listen,

01:55.699 --> 01:58.952
I don't want you answering this phone
until after the trial is over.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.246
You got me?

02:06.210 --> 02:07.211
Okay.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.539
Sullivan, let's go. I don't have all day.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.355
I told her to get you a clip-on.
You wanna get those first?

06:37.272 --> 06:39.274
Your Honor,
can I just have a moment with my client?

06:40.859 --> 06:41.902
Come here.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.153
It's fine.

06:43.153 --> 06:44.238
It's not.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.453
Okay. Look.

06:51.954 --> 06:57.376
Relax, because there's not a person
in this courtroom whose opinion counts.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.838
Not yet, anyway.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.716
Let's flip it. Easier in the mirror.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.594
There.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.347
Now you look like an upstanding citizen.

07:16.562 --> 07:18.605
- We're all set, Your Honor.
- Bring in the jury.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.690
All rise.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.578
Good morning.
My name is Patricia Richards.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.289
I'm a Manhattan
assistant district attorney

07:35.289 --> 07:36.915
representing the State of New York.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.084
And as Judge Posner already told you,

07:39.918 --> 07:43.338
the burden of proof
in this courtroom is on me.

07:44.715 --> 07:45.757
I welcome it.

07:46.967 --> 07:53.182
I welcome it because the proof
in this case is indisputable.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.350
Undeniable.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.647
There is video. There are witnesses.

08:01.148 --> 08:03.775
The only thing there isn't, is doubt.

08:06.778 --> 08:11.241
On May 18th of this year,
the defendant, Daniel Sullivan,

08:11.241 --> 08:16.872
aimed a .38-caliber pistol into a crowd
and fired six times.

08:16.872 --> 08:19.791
Three people were wounded.
The rest were lucky.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.004
Make no mistake,
the only reason this isn't a murder trial

08:24.671 --> 08:27.466
is because Daniel Sullivan
is a lousy shot.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.344
He belongs behind bars.

08:31.887 --> 08:35.474
But with evidence so provable,
so irrefutable,

08:35.474 --> 08:37.308
one wonders, what will the defense do?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.937
They cannot deny the facts,

08:39.937 --> 08:44.650
so they will divert you from them
by making unfounded and unproven claims

08:44.650 --> 08:50.614
about a condition they call
multiple personality disorder.

08:52.449 --> 08:54.201
Let me be clear,

08:54.201 --> 08:58.330
there is no such thing
as multiple personality disorder.

08:58.330 --> 09:02.584
It is a made-up condition
from a Sally Field movie, no less.

09:03.252 --> 09:05.587
They might as well claim
the defendant is a flying nun.

09:07.464 --> 09:12.719
The defense blames Mr. Sullivan's actions
on what they call an alter.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.723
Now, I can admit, I get the appeal.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.477
Don't we all wish we could
blame our mistakes on someone else?

09:20.477 --> 09:24.189
Run a red light? Blame an alter.
Bounce a check? Blame an alter.

09:25.107 --> 09:26.316
Cheat on a spouse?

09:27.150 --> 09:29.194
Well, let's see how that one flies.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.446
But can you imagine our judicial system

09:31.446 --> 09:35.117
if every time someone committed a crime,

09:36.535 --> 09:39.371
they could simply say, "It wasn't me."

09:42.624 --> 09:44.001
That's what's at stake here.

09:44.585 --> 09:48.714
These arguments from the defense,
they're more than desperate.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.174
They're dangerous.

09:51.675 --> 09:56.680
Because they undermine a bedrock principle
of both our legal system and our society:

09:58.140 --> 10:00.475
personal responsibility.

10:00.475 --> 10:04.980
We are responsible for our actions.

10:04.980 --> 10:10.235
The defendant is guilty,
and that guilt demands punishment.

10:10.235 --> 10:14.364
Otherwise, there can be no justice.

10:16.533 --> 10:17.659
Thank you.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.999
Mr. Camisa, for the defense.

10:48.190 --> 10:52.069
Indisputable. Undeniable. Irrefutable.

10:56.198 --> 10:58.325
You know, makes a guy wonder,
"Why am I even here?"

11:00.160 --> 11:02.329
That was some opening
from the prosecution.

11:03.747 --> 11:05.457
Bedrock principles.

11:07.918 --> 11:10.003
Well, here's a bedrock principle for you.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.006
He's innocent.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.677
He has the presumption of innocence.
It is his right.

11:17.386 --> 11:20.681
Now, this bears repeating
because of everything that you just heard.

11:20.681 --> 11:26.353
So, let me begin by saying it clearly
and as a simple statement of fact.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.775
Danny Sullivan didn't shoot anyone.

11:32.609 --> 11:36.154
He was there. He admits as much.

11:38.323 --> 11:40.033
But he didn't pull the trigger.

11:40.033 --> 11:43.662
Danny's a good kid, but he's a sick kid.

11:43.662 --> 11:49.126
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
no one is making up a condition.

11:49.126 --> 11:51.545
Now, I get how it sounds.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.257
Multiple personality disorder.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.722
You know, at first, I had a hard time
wrapping my head around it myself.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.934
But instead of making flying nun jokes,
which is easy,

12:07.186 --> 12:11.481
I kept an open mind, which is hard.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.401
And that's what I'm asking of you.

12:16.445 --> 12:19.489
To keep an open mind.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.408
Listen to the experts.

12:21.408 --> 12:25.204
Listen to the witnesses,
because if you do,

12:25.204 --> 12:27.831
you'll arrive at the same indisputable,

12:27.831 --> 12:30.959
undeniable, irrefutable conclusion
that I did,

12:30.959 --> 12:36.381
which is that Danny had no control
over his illness or his alters.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.634
Yeah, he's got alters.

12:38.634 --> 12:43.430
He's got alters because he was hurt
in unimaginable ways that broke him.

12:44.139 --> 12:45.807
It broke his mind into pieces.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.939
And no, they are not some
get-out-of-jail-free card.

12:51.939 --> 12:57.027
They are real, and they are not Danny.

12:57.778 --> 13:01.448
To send Danny to prison for a crime
that one of his alters committed

13:01.448 --> 13:05.327
would be the same as you going to jail
for a crime that I committed.

13:07.829 --> 13:09.498
Now, Danny's illness is rare,

13:09.498 --> 13:13.043
and it is the result of being exposed
to sexual abuse as a child.

13:13.669 --> 13:17.548
Frankly, he's lucky to have survived.
This illness is how he survived.

13:18.298 --> 13:22.553
I get it. It's weird. It's hard.

13:25.055 --> 13:28.100
But please, keep an open mind.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.228
Now, the prosecution was right
about one thing.

13:31.937 --> 13:38.151
This trial is about responsibility,
but it's not personal responsibility,

13:40.070 --> 13:42.072
it's societal responsibility.

13:42.072 --> 13:44.408
I mean,
you wanna talk about bedrock principles?

13:44.408 --> 13:47.035
How about how we just
take care of each other?

13:47.035 --> 13:49.454
How about how we take care
of the most hurt

13:49.454 --> 13:51.915
and the most vulnerable among us?

13:51.915 --> 13:54.084
Everybody has failed this kid.

13:54.084 --> 13:59.131
His parents, his teachers, his neighbors,
his friends, his community.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.341
All of us have failed him.

14:01.842 --> 14:05.012
So now it is on us to make it right.

14:05.637 --> 14:10.058
Now, I'm not asking you to set Danny free.

14:11.810 --> 14:14.855
I am only asking that you spare him prison

14:15.814 --> 14:19.151
and instead send him to a hospital
to get help.

14:19.151 --> 14:23.447
The help that he needs.
That is our responsibility.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.119
Thank you.

14:30.204 --> 14:33.999
We'll take a 15-minute recess
and then proceed to the State's witnesses.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.043
Officer, escort the jury out please.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.176
<i>You were actually pretty good in there.</i>

14:44.176 --> 14:46.011
Yeah? Pretty good doesn't matter.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.848
Goddamn it!
You know, Candy's not returning my calls,

14:49.848 --> 14:52.351
and she ignored her subpoena, by the way,
which is a crime.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.852
She's scared. She's guilty.

14:53.852 --> 14:56.605
There's so much shame,
she might not even admit it to herself.

14:56.605 --> 14:59.399
In all fairness,
do you think I give a shit how she feels?

15:00.067 --> 15:02.027
This case turns on the diagnosis,

15:02.027 --> 15:05.822
and the diagnosis depends
on showing the jury that Danny was abused.

15:08.075 --> 15:09.535
I just said it in there.

15:09.535 --> 15:13.038
If we don't get someone to testify to this
in open court, we are done.

15:13.539 --> 15:15.666
And I'm handcuffed, 'cause I can't
put my client on the stand

15:15.666 --> 15:17.084
'cause of that bullshit
he pulled in the hearing.

15:17.084 --> 15:19.336
- That was Jack. That wasn't Danny.
- Whoever it was,

15:19.336 --> 15:22.381
he's going to deny the abuse
and admit to the crime

15:23.090 --> 15:24.091
which would be bad.

15:24.091 --> 15:25.384
I am well aware.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.432
- You?
- You know I can't testify to his abuse.

15:32.432 --> 15:36.895
Technically, Danny never said
that he was abused. He never told me that.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.106
- Only Adam?
- Only Adam.

15:41.859 --> 15:44.778
I-- It's fucking useless.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.657
What are we gonna do?

15:49.992 --> 15:51.159
You gotta convince her.

15:51.994 --> 15:54.162
But that's not up to me, Stan.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.416
Doesn't a mother have to love her kid,
for Christ's sake?

15:57.416 --> 15:58.500
No.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.879
But in this case,
that's what we have going for us.

16:02.546 --> 16:03.380
What?

16:03.380 --> 16:04.631
That she does love him.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.596
<i>The State calls Marlin Reid.</i>

16:29.698 --> 16:32.743
<i>How would you describe
your relationship with your stepson?</i>

16:33.911 --> 16:37.456
Strained, it pains me to admit.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.082
Look, I'm not perfect.

16:39.708 --> 16:43.420
And
maybe sometimes I've been too hard on him.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.923
Maybe other times, not hard enough.

16:45.923 --> 16:50.177
The kids I see up at Osterville,
most never had a father, not a real one.

16:50.177 --> 16:54.431
And I wanted to be that for Danny.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.393
Tell me about Osterville. Tough job?

16:58.393 --> 17:02.439
Rewarding job.
These kids have had every disadvantage.

17:02.439 --> 17:05.983
You wouldn't believe what they've
survived in their homes, on the streets.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.402
Sure, they've made mistakes.

17:08.028 --> 17:12.199
But the thing I love about my job
is they're still kids,

17:12.866 --> 17:15.702
and it's not too late
for them to find their way back.

17:17.579 --> 17:19.373
You feel that way about Danny?

17:19.373 --> 17:22.792
I'll never give up on Danny,
but he's not a kid anymore.

17:23.335 --> 17:27.548
Given your relationship with him,
you have any idea why he did what he did?

17:36.640 --> 17:37.724
I honestly don't.

17:38.559 --> 17:41.562
Truth is, with Danny, there is no "why."

17:41.562 --> 17:45.232
When he was picking fights at school,
or stealing from me,

17:45.232 --> 17:47.985
or dealing drugs or using, the "why"--

17:50.279 --> 17:51.572
Why is just Danny.

17:53.782 --> 17:55.951
Just one more question, Mr. Reid.

17:55.951 --> 17:58.287
At any point after you were shot,

17:59.413 --> 18:01.874
did you report your stepson
to the authorities?

18:03.417 --> 18:05.335
- No.
- Why not?

18:06.086 --> 18:08.255
Because I wanted to protect him.

18:10.382 --> 18:12.009
Because in spite of everything...

18:14.636 --> 18:17.055
I love him like my own son.

18:22.895 --> 18:24.271
No further questions.

18:25.939 --> 18:28.984
<i>A dramatic first day in court
as nine different witnesses</i>

18:28.984 --> 18:31.486
<i>identified Sullivan
as the Rockefeller Center shooter,</i>

18:31.486 --> 18:33.155
<i>including his own stepfather,</i>

18:33.155 --> 18:35.657
<i>Juvenile Correctional Counselor
Marlin Reid.</i>

18:35.657 --> 18:36.867
<i>Were you the intended target?</i>

18:36.867 --> 18:39.661
<i>I don't know.
But the toughest thing you learn in--</i>

18:47.461 --> 18:48.462
Smells good.

18:49.546 --> 18:50.923
Needs another 20 minutes.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.177
How did he seem?

18:59.473 --> 19:02.351
Thin. I don't know.
It's not like we talked or anything.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.191
How'd I look?

19:16.615 --> 19:17.824
- You're kidding, right?
- What?

19:19.451 --> 19:20.953
I'm just trying to do the right thing.

19:20.953 --> 19:22.996
The kid shot at me, Candy.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.206
Jesus.

19:30.629 --> 19:31.630
Taking a shower.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.356
Stop calling here. I'm not testifying.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.440
<i>Mom?</i>

19:51.400 --> 19:52.401
Danny.

20:02.452 --> 20:03.996
I meant to come see you.

20:05.455 --> 20:06.456
<i>It's okay.</i>

20:11.587 --> 20:12.713
I'm sorry.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.214
Baby, this is not your fault.

20:19.469 --> 20:20.470
I'm sorry.

20:45.704 --> 20:47.789
<i>It isn't even a real diagnosis.</i>

20:47.789 --> 20:51.376
It's just a fringe theory
amplified by a TV movie.

20:51.376 --> 20:53.045
Then what do you make of Danny?

20:53.045 --> 20:55.714
Well, I'll tell you the same thing
that I told the jury.

20:55.714 --> 20:58.550
That I believe that
Mr. Sullivan is a malingerer.

20:58.550 --> 21:01.303
Acting in bad faith
to avoid criminal consequences.

21:01.303 --> 21:04.097
In layman's terms? For the folks at home.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.975
He's faking it
to keep himself out of jail.

21:09.478 --> 21:11.230
<i>I tried to get him to be reasonable.</i>

21:11.230 --> 21:12.648
How'd that go?

21:12.648 --> 21:14.274
Not what you would call ideal.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.903
He blindsided me, broke my nose
and stole it anyway.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.030
Did you attempt to retrieve your gun?

21:20.030 --> 21:23.158
Yeah, I did.
I went to his house. I was pissed.

21:23.659 --> 21:26.745
But we had history.
I figured we could work something out.

21:28.539 --> 21:32.084
Got as far as a hello though
before he attacked me with a baseball bat.

21:32.084 --> 21:33.627
Then he shot at me.

21:36.588 --> 21:39.508
- No further questions, Your Honor.
- Mr. Camisa.

21:39.508 --> 21:45.180
Yeah, just one question. Mr. Ruiz,
you've known Danny for years.

21:46.682 --> 21:48.934
In all that time,
has he ever seemed normal?

21:48.934 --> 21:50.060
Normal?

21:51.562 --> 21:54.523
That boy's nuts.
Craziest son of a bitch I know.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.193
No further questions.

22:00.571 --> 22:01.738
<i>I was scared.</i>

22:02.948 --> 22:04.783
I'd never seen Danny like that before.

22:07.244 --> 22:08.453
Then I heard the shot.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.706
What did you think
when you heard that gunshot?

22:11.456 --> 22:12.916
I thought that he killed him.

22:13.625 --> 22:18.255
You believed Danny Sullivan
to be capable of murder?

22:19.214 --> 22:20.424
In that moment, yes.

22:22.092 --> 22:23.760
No further questions, Your Honor.

22:33.395 --> 22:34.396
Hi, Annabelle.

22:37.482 --> 22:39.067
Was Danny ever violent with you?

22:39.067 --> 22:40.152
No.

22:40.152 --> 22:42.946
- He ever make you feel unsafe?
- No.

22:42.946 --> 22:44.448
Was he mean? Abusive?

22:44.448 --> 22:46.116
No. Never.

22:46.658 --> 22:49.995
Then what was he like,
the Danny you knew? Your friend.

22:50.746 --> 22:51.788
He was sweet.

22:53.207 --> 22:55.626
He was quiet. Shy.

22:56.585 --> 22:57.586
Mostly.

22:58.212 --> 23:01.673
- Mostly?
- He was, yeah, sometimes not so shy.

23:04.009 --> 23:05.552
He was a little all over the place.

23:05.552 --> 23:08.222
I'd like to refer the witness
to defense exhibit four.

23:08.222 --> 23:09.306
Go ahead.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.606
You recognize this drawing?

23:19.191 --> 23:20.317
Yeah, Danny drew it.

23:21.235 --> 23:22.236
It's you?

23:22.945 --> 23:24.029
Yep.

23:24.029 --> 23:25.113
It's good.

23:25.739 --> 23:27.741
Yeah, it's good.

23:27.741 --> 23:29.743
Danny really cared about you, didn't he?

23:33.622 --> 23:34.748
I cared about him too.

23:35.415 --> 23:37.084
Earlier in your testimony--

23:37.793 --> 23:40.087
now I'm referring
to the night with Mr. Ruiz--

23:40.087 --> 23:43.924
you said,
"I'd never seen Danny like that."

23:43.924 --> 23:48.846
How do you reconcile that night,
that Danny, with the boy that you knew?

23:48.846 --> 23:53.642
The sweet and quiet, never violent,
shy but sometimes not.

23:53.642 --> 23:55.227
The boy who drew this picture.

24:01.233 --> 24:03.360
Doesn't seem like the same person,
does it?

24:05.070 --> 24:06.071
No.

24:09.032 --> 24:10.492
No further questions, Your Honor.

24:11.702 --> 24:14.621
- State requests a redirect.
- Proceed.

24:16.498 --> 24:19.042
To the best of your knowledge,
in the time you knew him,

24:19.042 --> 24:21.336
was the encounter with Mr. Ruiz

24:21.336 --> 24:24.715
the only occasion
that Danny Sullivan was ever violent?

24:24.715 --> 24:26.383
Objection, irrelevant.

24:26.383 --> 24:29.678
The question speaks
to the defendant's history of violence.

24:29.678 --> 24:30.762
Overruled.

24:30.762 --> 24:34.433
Was the encounter with Mr. Ruiz
the only occasion

24:35.392 --> 24:37.644
that Danny Sullivan was ever violent?

24:38.687 --> 24:39.521
No.

24:40.731 --> 24:43.233
Back in high school,
I had this boyfriend, Bill.

24:43.817 --> 24:44.943
Danny got jealous.

24:45.444 --> 24:48.655
He beat him pretty bad.
He put him in the hospital.

24:49.531 --> 24:50.532
Another kid too.

24:51.366 --> 24:54.161
At the time,
I told myself it was this freak thing.

24:55.996 --> 24:57.122
Maybe Bill deserved it.

24:58.207 --> 24:59.458
Now I'm not so sure.

25:02.211 --> 25:03.420
No further questions.

25:38.288 --> 25:41.416
They're off to stalk your son
at the side exit.

25:41.416 --> 25:45.295
Apparently, perp walks sell papers.
Even the same perp walk twice a day.

25:46.129 --> 25:48.006
Do you wanna see him?
I can walk you around.

25:49.174 --> 25:51.301
No, not like that.

25:53.762 --> 25:54.763
I'm glad you came.

25:57.015 --> 25:58.475
There's a shitty bar around the corner.

25:58.475 --> 26:00.978
It's mostly lawyers,
but at this hour it's not that bad.

26:04.273 --> 26:06.275
I don't know what you people want from me.

26:09.570 --> 26:11.780
Please tell me
that you convinced her to testify.

26:11.780 --> 26:14.950
She came, didn't she? That's progress.

26:14.950 --> 26:16.785
Progress is for people with time.

26:17.369 --> 26:18.871
They're painting a picture of a kid

26:18.871 --> 26:20.873
who goes after
his perfectly nice stepfather,

26:20.873 --> 26:23.417
shoots up a bunch of innocent people
in the process,

26:23.417 --> 26:26.253
and now he's pretending that
he hears voices so he can get out of jail.

26:26.253 --> 26:27.921
It's pretty compelling stuff
if you ask me.

26:27.921 --> 26:29.381
Whose side are you on, Stan?

26:30.007 --> 26:31.800
Right now, the losing one.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.010
Is it too late to switch?

26:33.969 --> 26:39.391
So she sees it today, her kid on trial,
and she goes back home to him.

26:39.391 --> 26:40.475
Stays with him.

26:41.143 --> 26:42.811
God, how does that even work?

26:42.811 --> 26:45.355
Maybe we're just not built
to survive alone.

26:45.355 --> 26:47.900
I mean, did you know that our brain
has these chemical receptors

26:47.900 --> 26:50.360
that light up
when we make human connections?

26:50.360 --> 26:52.821
- Oh, yeah?
- It literally turns on

26:52.821 --> 26:54.865
to make us feel like we're safe.

26:56.241 --> 26:59.995
Only, sometimes other people aren't safe.

26:59.995 --> 27:02.414
Yeah, amen to that.

27:03.665 --> 27:06.251
I feel like you're gonna
make an ex-wife joke.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.670
I was considering it.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.047
Go on anyway.

27:10.547 --> 27:13.509
There's a whole world of ways
that people hurt each other.

27:13.509 --> 27:15.385
Yeah, you don't know the half of it.

27:19.640 --> 27:23.936
Too much pain, in rare cases like Danny's,
the mind shatters.

27:23.936 --> 27:25.604
But most people, they--

27:25.604 --> 27:27.981
they find conventional ways
of avoiding the pain,

27:27.981 --> 27:32.945
like booze and drugs, sex,
that light up those receptors.

27:33.529 --> 27:36.532
- Those things work.
- And also being with the wrong person,

27:36.532 --> 27:39.451
because at least
the pain is familiar to them.

27:41.912 --> 27:47.376
If you ask me, I think
that if a relationship can break you,

27:47.376 --> 27:51.380
then sometimes a relationship
can also heal you.

27:51.964 --> 27:53.715
Please tell me
you're not saying love is the answer.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.552
I actually am.

27:59.513 --> 28:02.516
It's like that arrow story
that Jack told Danny.

28:02.516 --> 28:05.978
Fear of pain
is worse than the pain ever was.

28:07.145 --> 28:08.939
Jack? You mean make-believe Jack?

28:09.565 --> 28:10.566
Yeah.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.446
We've all been hurt.

28:16.446 --> 28:17.739
Some more than others.

28:20.492 --> 28:24.162
<i>And we can have a tendency
to stay in relationships that are bad.</i>

28:24.162 --> 28:28.750
<i>Those receptors are firing, telling us
not to risk losing what we have.</i>

28:31.753 --> 28:32.588
Come here.

28:32.588 --> 28:37.050
<i>Even if it's to find something
better for us, healthier for us.</i>

28:37.634 --> 28:41.555
<i>We stay with the hurt we know
rather than risk being hurt again.</i>

28:42.639 --> 28:44.141
<i>But we have a choice.</i>

28:45.976 --> 28:47.728
<i>The truth is, we always have.</i>

28:48.312 --> 28:50.939
<i>We just have to remember
to try to keep making it.</i>

28:52.316 --> 28:55.194
<i>To remember that other people can hurt us,</i>

28:56.236 --> 28:57.779
<i>but they can also help us.</i>

28:58.780 --> 29:02.451
<i>That to reach out,
to let someone reach back,</i>

29:03.660 --> 29:05.120
<i>is a way out of pain.</i>

29:08.624 --> 29:09.958
<i>That doesn't mean it's easy.</i>

29:12.211 --> 29:13.295
<i>It's hard.</i>

29:15.172 --> 29:16.173
<i>Terrifying.</i>

29:19.885 --> 29:22.137
<i>We need to be brave like Danny was brave,</i>

29:23.055 --> 29:24.348
<i>and ask for help.</i>

29:25.974 --> 29:27.309
<i>We don't have to be alone.</i>

29:29.811 --> 29:30.812
Lights out.

29:40.864 --> 29:43.283
We met at Danceteria, this club on 37th.

29:43.784 --> 29:45.702
Tell me about her. What was she like?

29:46.954 --> 29:50.165
Ariana was something else.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.710
The way she moved. The way she smiled.

29:54.628 --> 29:55.879
Iridescent.

29:55.879 --> 29:57.422
Everyone wanted to be with her.

29:57.422 --> 29:58.966
The boys, the girls.

29:58.966 --> 30:01.218
And she knew it. She worked it.

30:01.218 --> 30:05.305
Mr. Williams,
do you see Ariana in this courtroom?

30:09.268 --> 30:10.435
No.

30:10.435 --> 30:11.520
No?

30:12.229 --> 30:16.567
The thing is, he's not her. Not anymore.

30:17.067 --> 30:18.151
How can you tell?

30:18.652 --> 30:20.112
Everything about him is different.

30:20.112 --> 30:23.907
Like the way he sits, curled in so small.

30:23.907 --> 30:28.078
And his eyes, which give up everything.

30:29.121 --> 30:32.124
Ariana had a resting poker face.

30:32.124 --> 30:34.251
Girl was a brick wall.

30:35.043 --> 30:37.254
Not to mention, Danny's straight.

30:38.005 --> 30:40.048
So you know Danny? You've met Danny?

30:40.048 --> 30:42.301
I met him at Rikers a few weeks ago.

30:42.301 --> 30:45.596
I saw the story in the paper,
and I went over there.

30:45.596 --> 30:48.098
I was just-- I was looking to understand,
I guess.

30:48.098 --> 30:50.017
And what'd you find at Rikers?

30:53.770 --> 30:54.771
A stranger.

31:00.235 --> 31:03.238
Mr. Williams, did you have
a sexual relationship with the defendant?

31:04.198 --> 31:05.741
I had a relationship with Ariana.

31:05.741 --> 31:07.659
I didn't ask you
what the defendant called himself.

31:07.659 --> 31:10.579
- I asked if you had a sexual--
- Objection. Asked and answered.

31:10.579 --> 31:11.830
Overruled.

31:12.414 --> 31:15.626
I could put the question to you
in more graphic terms, if you'd like.

31:17.920 --> 31:19.421
Yes, we did.

31:19.421 --> 31:21.673
- Where?
- Objection, irrelevant.

31:21.673 --> 31:24.384
The question speaks to the true nature
of their relationship.

31:25.052 --> 31:26.345
Overruled.

31:26.345 --> 31:27.513
Where?

31:28.972 --> 31:29.973
The men's room.

31:30.933 --> 31:32.226
The men's room.

31:33.644 --> 31:35.479
How romantic.

31:35.479 --> 31:37.439
Couldn't anyone have just walked in?

31:38.065 --> 31:40.317
Were your encounters in full public view?

31:40.317 --> 31:41.777
We used a stall.

31:41.777 --> 31:45.239
Mr. Williams, you never shared
a meal with the defendant.

31:45.239 --> 31:47.449
- Never saw his home, did you?
- No.

31:47.449 --> 31:49.159
- Ever meet his friends?
- No.

31:49.159 --> 31:50.869
- Family?
- No.

31:50.869 --> 31:54.456
Your most intimate moments
were in a bathroom stall.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.544
How well could you possibly have known
this man?

31:58.544 --> 32:00.212
There was no "this man."

32:00.212 --> 32:03.298
There was only Ariana, and I knew her.

32:03.298 --> 32:07.636
These clubs you frequent,
are there ever closeted gay men there?

32:08.136 --> 32:09.972
- Men with something to hide.
- Sure.

32:09.972 --> 32:14.935
So how could you know
that Ariana wasn't just an alias?

32:14.935 --> 32:16.728
A cover. A lie.

32:29.992 --> 32:30.993
It's on me.

32:30.993 --> 32:32.202
Mr. Camisa--

32:32.202 --> 32:34.705
Stan. And please, I got a tab here.
Tell her, Sam.

32:35.372 --> 32:36.498
He does owe me money.

32:36.999 --> 32:39.084
I come here a lot. It's nothing. Please.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.007
We're gonna lose, Candy.

32:45.007 --> 32:48.635
Multiple personality disorder
is only ever caused by one thing,

32:49.428 --> 32:51.638
and we can't prove that it ever happened.

32:51.638 --> 32:54.308
And worse, Danny denies it ever happened.

32:54.308 --> 32:56.393
It's like arguing a guy is shell-shocked

32:56.393 --> 32:58.645
and he swears
that he's never even seen a war.

32:58.645 --> 33:00.814
Our entire defense is built around this.

33:00.814 --> 33:02.608
Well, then you've got the wrong defense.

33:02.608 --> 33:04.860
- Candy--
- And you should have seen it coming.

33:04.860 --> 33:07.196
Well, why do you think
I've been calling you, repeatedly?

33:07.196 --> 33:09.865
Calling me
is not an actual legal strategy.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.201
I also subpoenaed you, which is.

33:12.701 --> 33:13.827
And you ignored it.

33:14.995 --> 33:17.164
I can ask the judge
to find you in contempt, you know.

33:20.292 --> 33:24.254
Look, please take the stand.

33:24.254 --> 33:25.964
Just tell 'em what happened to Danny.

33:27.382 --> 33:31.136
Are you even aware of the accusation
that you're making right now?

33:31.136 --> 33:34.515
- Well, your husband's a sick man, Can--
- Not against my husband, against me.

33:37.434 --> 33:39.645
Find me in fucking contempt.

33:49.112 --> 33:54.910
The mind is an extraordinary thing,
capable of extraordinary transformations.

33:54.910 --> 33:58.497
Not just voices, but bodies. Skills.

33:58.497 --> 34:00.707
Playing an instrument, mastering chess,

34:00.707 --> 34:03.210
speaking a foreign language,
lighting up a room.

34:03.210 --> 34:05.504
These aren't things
that people can just fake.

34:05.504 --> 34:08.090
And these are people who come
from every walk of life.

34:08.090 --> 34:10.050
Every race. Every age.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.635
They're people who have nothing to gain

34:11.635 --> 34:14.388
from a diagnosis
that carries social stigma.

34:14.388 --> 34:15.973
MPD is real.

34:15.973 --> 34:21.103
And patients with MPD have suffered
in ways that most of us cannot comprehend.

34:22.521 --> 34:27.317
- They deserve empathy and compassion.
- And how have they suffered?

34:27.317 --> 34:30.152
Can't anyone just claim
to have other personalities inside them?

34:30.152 --> 34:31.530
The literature is clear.

34:31.530 --> 34:33.657
For the diagnosis to apply,

34:33.657 --> 34:37.661
the patients must have experienced
severe childhood trauma,

34:38.370 --> 34:39.454
usually sexual.

34:40.038 --> 34:42.248
At a point in their lives
when they are the most vulnerable--

34:42.248 --> 34:43.667
the most in need of protection--

34:43.667 --> 34:47.462
they are betrayed,
usually by somebody that they trusted.

34:47.963 --> 34:51.592
A child's mind isn't equipped
to handle this.

34:51.592 --> 34:54.178
It can't manage all the contradictions.

34:55.344 --> 34:59.266
So the psyche fractures
and that's the first alter.

34:59.766 --> 35:00.934
The child goes away.

35:01.518 --> 35:02.978
Somebody new comes in.

35:02.978 --> 35:07.816
Someone better equipped
to navigate a terrifying world.

35:09.484 --> 35:10.944
And that's how it begins.

35:11.570 --> 35:16.200
It's a defense mechanism against horrific,
unfathomable pain.

35:17.910 --> 35:19.161
Can you tell me about Danny?

35:21.663 --> 35:24.291
I first met Danny at the police station
after his arrest.

35:24.291 --> 35:25.834
Only it wasn't Danny, it was Jonny.

35:25.834 --> 35:27.127
And who's Jonny?

35:27.127 --> 35:30.881
Jonny is one of Danny's alters.
He's a literal escape artist.

35:31.548 --> 35:34.551
So when the shackles came out,
so did Jonny.

35:36.803 --> 35:38.680
So are these descriptions

35:38.680 --> 35:43.685
of Danny's so-called personalities
facts or speculations?

35:43.685 --> 35:45.479
They're my clinical judgments.

35:45.479 --> 35:48.482
Did Danny ever tell you
he thought he had multiple personalities?

35:48.482 --> 35:49.399
No, but it doesn't--

35:49.399 --> 35:52.861
In fact, wasn't it you
who first introduced the idea to him?

35:52.861 --> 35:55.906
Yes, because his symptoms
supported the diagnosis.

35:55.906 --> 35:57.074
So you say.

35:57.658 --> 35:59.451
But then you have a lot riding on this,
don't you?

35:59.451 --> 36:02.246
- I'm not sure what you mean.
- Who pays for your research?

36:02.246 --> 36:03.455
How do you make a living?

36:04.122 --> 36:06.750
Most of my work is funded through grants.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.877
- Grants like the Reiling Grant?
- Yes.

36:08.877 --> 36:10.921
- Which expired last year.
- Yes.

36:10.921 --> 36:14.508
And is it true the university
just turned down a request from you

36:14.508 --> 36:15.801
for additional funding?

36:15.801 --> 36:19.429
There's only so much to go around,
but I'm going to reapply in the spring.

36:19.429 --> 36:21.640
- You have tenure?
- I'm up for it next year.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.600
So, with your funding drying up,

36:23.600 --> 36:26.979
your major grant expiring
and with tenure on the line,

36:26.979 --> 36:30.440
would it be fair to say that this is
a make-or-break moment in your career?

36:30.440 --> 36:32.526
- Objection.
- Withdraw the question.

36:32.526 --> 36:36.613
Would it be fair to say
that a high-profile case like this one

36:36.613 --> 36:38.907
could be a real opportunity for you?

36:39.908 --> 36:41.577
Chance for you
to make a name for yourself.

36:42.536 --> 36:45.247
- I don't see my patients as opportunities.
- Don't you?

36:45.247 --> 36:47.916
I mean, why else did you walk
into that police station?

36:48.417 --> 36:51.837
Was it because you were having
a sexual relationship with the detective

36:51.837 --> 36:53.630
- who leaked Danny's case to you?
- Objection.

36:53.630 --> 36:55.674
Sustained. Take care, Counselor.

36:56.258 --> 36:57.426
Withdrawn.

36:58.302 --> 37:01.555
Why did you follow
the defendant to Rikers?

37:01.555 --> 37:06.393
There's a term for lawyers
who solicit business like that.

37:06.393 --> 37:07.936
- Ambulance chasers.
- Objection.

37:07.936 --> 37:10.439
- Sustained.
- Let me put it another way.

37:11.023 --> 37:15.194
When you walked into that police station,
what were you hoping to find?

37:15.194 --> 37:16.904
I wasn't hoping to find anything.

37:16.904 --> 37:20.449
See, I'm sorry,
but I find that hard to believe.

37:21.408 --> 37:25.579
You get a tip about a kid.
You drop everything.

37:25.579 --> 37:27.664
You run halfway across Manhattan.

37:27.664 --> 37:30.459
- What did you take? The bus? The train?
- I took the train.

37:30.459 --> 37:33.003
You mean to tell me
you're not sitting on that train,

37:33.003 --> 37:35.506
hoping that this is the one?

37:35.506 --> 37:37.174
The one who makes you famous.

37:37.174 --> 37:39.343
The one who puts you
on the national stage.

37:39.343 --> 37:40.719
- Absolutely not.
- Objection.

37:40.719 --> 37:42.137
What do you know, it worked.

37:42.137 --> 37:44.431
Your Honor, the witness is not on trial.

37:44.431 --> 37:46.934
Sustained. Move on, Counselor.

37:46.934 --> 37:49.770
Okay, Doctor. One last question.

37:49.770 --> 37:51.396
The defense claims--

37:51.396 --> 37:57.903
You claim that the cause of
Danny's so-called multiple personalities

37:59.112 --> 38:00.864
was sexual abuse in childhood.

38:02.616 --> 38:05.160
In all of your sessions
with the defendant,

38:06.537 --> 38:09.081
has he ever told you
he was sexually abused?

38:13.001 --> 38:16.046
Dr. Goodwin, has anyone ever told you

38:16.046 --> 38:20.926
or had the defendant ever claimed
he was sexually abused?

38:22.678 --> 38:24.805
It's a yes or no question.

38:28.976 --> 38:30.060
Dr. Goodwin?

38:36.108 --> 38:36.942
No.

38:40.904 --> 38:42.197
No further questions, Your Honor.

38:43.407 --> 38:45.284
<i>Dr. Goodwin?</i>

38:48.287 --> 38:49.997
What do you have to say for your client?

38:49.997 --> 38:52.374
Dr. Goodwin, how do you defend yourself?

39:22.362 --> 39:23.780
So, you were just using him?

39:26.283 --> 39:28.577
Candy,
that could not be further from the truth.

39:28.577 --> 39:30.329
And Camisa? He's out of his depth.

39:30.329 --> 39:32.456
- Stan's a good lawyer.
- He's Legal Aid.

39:32.456 --> 39:34.249
He's working his ass off.

39:34.249 --> 39:35.459
He's falling apart.

39:35.459 --> 39:36.668
Who isn't?

39:38.128 --> 39:40.255
- Why are you here?
- 'Cause I know how this ends.

39:40.255 --> 39:42.007
I know who you'll all blame.

39:43.300 --> 39:45.761
But that's bullshit.
You're the ones who let him down.

39:49.348 --> 39:50.432
Candy, I--

39:51.308 --> 39:53.852
I gave your son everything that I have.

39:55.521 --> 39:58.607
My heart is broken.
But my conscience is clear.

39:58.607 --> 39:59.525
So is mine.

39:59.525 --> 40:01.985
If that were true,
you wouldn't have followed me in here.

40:03.362 --> 40:04.571
And you're wrong.

40:04.571 --> 40:07.908
I would never have blamed you. Never.

40:09.660 --> 40:10.661
Bullshit.

40:20.712 --> 40:25.050
I had this patient, Anna,
when I was a first-year resident.

40:27.636 --> 40:31.765
And Anna had been raped six times,
by six different men,

40:31.765 --> 40:33.267
over the course of eight years.

40:33.267 --> 40:35.269
And, Candy, she was 19.

40:35.894 --> 40:37.145
How do you explain that?

40:39.398 --> 40:42.693
There's a phenomenon, an awful phenomenon.

40:44.069 --> 40:45.779
Victims of abuse survive.

40:45.779 --> 40:50.450
They get away,
only to be abused again by somebody else.

40:52.160 --> 40:58.083
And I think, hearing these stories,
"My God, these poor people.

40:59.084 --> 41:01.461
The unluckiest human beings
on the planet."

41:02.796 --> 41:04.798
Only it's not luck.

41:04.798 --> 41:07.509
It is a fucked up twist of nature.

41:09.636 --> 41:14.641
Because as children,
they are forced to relate sexually.

41:16.393 --> 41:18.937
They are trained to be abused.

41:19.646 --> 41:24.109
Predators are very adept
at finding their prey.

41:24.902 --> 41:28.071
They're picking up on cues
that nobody else can see.

41:28.655 --> 41:32.701
These cues can be chemical,
psychological, behavioral, nonverbal.

41:34.953 --> 41:36.997
To the predator, neon signs.

41:37.497 --> 41:40.626
And here's the thing
that I cannot emphasize enough.

41:43.212 --> 41:47.216
None of it is under the victim's control.

41:49.510 --> 41:52.888
None of it is the victim's fault.

41:56.683 --> 41:58.852
You and Danny were prey,

41:59.811 --> 42:02.689
and I suspect Marlin isn't
the first predator in your life.

42:04.274 --> 42:05.400
And it's not your fault.

42:07.653 --> 42:09.696
And my heart breaks for you, it does.

42:11.031 --> 42:13.242
Because you did nothing to deserve it.

42:16.161 --> 42:20.040
So, no, I wouldn't blame you.

42:22.292 --> 42:23.293
For anything.

42:25.838 --> 42:30.634
But my hope would be
that if you take the stand,

42:31.301 --> 42:37.057
you might finally be able to
stop blaming yourself.

42:45.732 --> 42:46.733
Marlin.

42:55.409 --> 42:57.327
Do you understand what you're asking?

42:59.454 --> 43:00.914
Guilt or grief...

43:03.542 --> 43:05.127
which one can you bear?

43:16.471 --> 43:19.474
You make too much bacon.
It's not good for me.

43:21.226 --> 43:23.312
I only make it because you like it.

43:23.312 --> 43:25.689
Yeah, well, I like living too.
So, cut back.

43:25.689 --> 43:28.317
Let's face it, I could lose a few.

43:29.651 --> 43:31.278
We've got to look out for each other.

43:32.821 --> 43:33.822
See ya.

45:02.619 --> 45:03.620
Hi, honey.

45:05.664 --> 45:08.125
Thought I'd come by. See you up there.

45:12.296 --> 45:14.631
I'm not a stupid man, Candy.
I know why you're here.

45:14.631 --> 45:16.133
I know what you're gonna say.

45:16.133 --> 45:18.427
I'm not even
going to tell you not to say it.

45:18.427 --> 45:19.887
You do what you want.

45:20.596 --> 45:24.391
But I wouldn't be doing my duty
as your husband if I didn't tell you

45:24.391 --> 45:26.435
that the words you say--

45:26.435 --> 45:32.441
that this terrible lie will change
the world you live in overnight.

45:33.650 --> 45:37.487
<i>I mean, people staring at the A&P
and whispers all over town.</i>

45:37.487 --> 45:39.573
<i>"What kind of mother would allow
such a thing?"</i>

45:40.282 --> 45:42.284
<i>Well, you'll lose your husband, of course.</i>

45:42.284 --> 45:45.579
<i>You'll also lose your job
and your home, eventually.</i>

45:46.580 --> 45:49.791
<i>Worst of all,
you will lose the illusion of who you are.</i>

45:50.626 --> 45:55.214
<i>And without it, all anyone will see
is what you allowed and what you admitted.</i>

45:57.341 --> 45:58.759
<i>That's all Danny will see.</i>

46:00.344 --> 46:01.637
So, you'll lose him too.

46:09.061 --> 46:10.854
<i>What was Danny like as a kid?</i>

46:10.854 --> 46:14.399
He was a good boy. Sweet boy.

46:15.192 --> 46:17.819
- But he was always different.
- Different how?

46:19.404 --> 46:25.410
Too sensitive, I guess. Tender.

46:29.706 --> 46:34.962
The world's a tough place,
and we were all each other had.

46:37.631 --> 46:41.426
Ms. Reid, I'm gonna have to ask you
some difficult questions now.

46:41.426 --> 46:43.512
You can take your time
answering them, okay?

46:49.726 --> 46:53.772
Do you believe your son, Danny,
was ever sexually abused?

46:53.772 --> 46:54.857
Objection.

46:54.857 --> 46:59.945
Unless she personally witnessed abuse,
any answer will be pure speculation.

46:59.945 --> 47:03.866
Your Honor, most abuse happens
in secret without witnesses.

47:03.866 --> 47:06.910
If the mother of a child isn't considered
an expert witness

47:06.910 --> 47:09.705
on what happened to her son
in her own home, who is?

47:11.290 --> 47:13.166
Overruled. Proceed.

47:13.667 --> 47:16.795
Ms. Reid, do you believe
Danny was ever sexually abused?

47:31.185 --> 47:32.186
No.

47:33.687 --> 47:36.690
- I'm sorry. Let me ask that again.
- I don't believe he was abused.

47:38.609 --> 47:43.238
Ms. Reid, I understand
that this is very difficult for you.

47:43.822 --> 47:46.158
I just want to remind you
that you are under oath.

47:48.035 --> 47:50.662
Are you sure
there wasn't any kind of abuse?

47:50.662 --> 47:51.747
Objection.

47:51.747 --> 47:53.165
Are you sure you didn't hear anything?

47:53.165 --> 47:54.291
Asked and answered.

47:54.291 --> 47:56.502
- Are you sure that you didn't see any--
- Sustained.

48:03.175 --> 48:04.176
Ms. Reid?

48:05.385 --> 48:06.386
No.

48:09.932 --> 48:10.933
No further questions.

48:11.850 --> 48:12.851
Ms. Richards.

48:14.269 --> 48:15.437
No questions, Your Honor.

48:15.437 --> 48:17.314
The witness is excused.

48:32.579 --> 48:34.706
We'll adjourn till tomorrow.

48:34.706 --> 48:36.166
Escort the jury out please.

48:38.085 --> 48:39.086
All rise.

48:47.302 --> 48:48.554
Danny, stand up.

49:09.241 --> 49:14.037
<i>We tramped the open moorland
In the rainy April weather</i>

49:16.039 --> 49:20.961
<i>And came upon the little inn
That we had found together</i>

49:22.129 --> 49:28.302
<i>The landlord gave us toast and tea
And stopped to share a joke</i>

49:29.636 --> 49:33.223
<i>And I remember firelight</i>

49:36.602 --> 49:41.315
<i>I remember firelight</i>

49:41.315 --> 49:44.484
<i>And you remember smoke</i>

49:48.572 --> 49:53.702
<i>We ran about the meadow grass
With all the harebells bending</i>

49:56.955 --> 50:02.419
<i>And shaking in the summer wind
A summer never-ending</i>

50:03.462 --> 50:08.926
<i>We wandered to the little stream
Among the river flats</i>

50:09.510 --> 50:13.555
<i>And I remember willow trees</i>

50:13.555 --> 50:20.729
<i>I remember willow trees</i>

50:21.355 --> 50:24.399
<i>And you remember gnats</i>

50:29.363 --> 50:35.285
<i>We strolled the Spanish marketplace
At 90 in the shade</i>

50:36.036 --> 50:40.999
<i>With all the fruit and vegetables
So temptingly arrayed</i>

50:42.209 --> 50:45.379
<i>And we can share a memory</i>

50:45.921 --> 50:49.383
<i>As every lover must</i>

50:49.967 --> 50:53.387
<i>And I remember oranges</i>

50:53.387 --> 51:00.227
<i>I remember oranges</i>

50:56.390 --> 51:00.227
<i>I remember oranges</i>

51:00.727 --> 51:03.647
<i>And you remember dust</i>

51:05.607 --> 51:10.404
<i>The autumn leaves are tumbling down
And winter's almost here</i>

51:11.446 --> 51:16.201
<i>But through the spring and summertime
We laughed away the year</i>

51:30.591 --> 51:34.887
<i>Two happy hearts that beat as one</i>

51:35.554 --> 51:41.018
<i>When I had thought that we were "we"</i>

51:43.020 --> 51:49.985
<i>But we were "you and me"</i>
