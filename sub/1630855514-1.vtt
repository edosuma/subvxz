<i>On my count.</i>

34:07.420 --> 34:10.639
<i>Three... two... one...</i>

34:18.473 --> 34:21.443
<i>Set target. Severnaya.</i>

34:32.487 --> 34:35.161
<i>Arm the weapon.</i>

35:12.527 --> 35:16.532

35:16.615 --> 35:18.663
<i>{klaxon}</i>

35:51.149 --> 35:54.494
<i>It's clean. I had to ventilate someone.</i>

36:31.189 --> 36:34.284
<i>- Good evening, Moneypenny.
- Good evening, James.</i>

36:34.359 --> 36:37.533
<i>M will meet you in the Situation Room.
I'm to take you in.</i>

36:37.737 --> 36:40.957
<i>- Never seen you after hours. Lovely.
- Thank you, James.</i>

36:41.032 --> 36:44.878
<i>Out on some kind of assignment?
Dressing to kill?</i>

36:44.994 --> 36:47.543
<i>I know you'll find this crushing, O07,</i>

36:47.664 --> 36:51.385
<i>but I don't sit at home
praying for an international incident</i>

36:51.501 --> 36:54.846
<i>so I can run down here
all dressed up to impress James Bond.</i>

36:55.130 --> 36:58.600
<i>I was on a date with a gentleman.
We went to the theatre.</i>

36:58.800 --> 37:01.269
<i>Moneypenny, I'm devastated.</i>

37:01.386 --> 37:03.639
<i>What would I ever do without you?</i>

37:03.722 --> 37:07.898
<i>As far as I can remember, James,
you've never had me.</i>

37:10.812 --> 37:13.281
<i>Hope springs eternal.</i>

37:13.481 --> 37:17.031
<i>This sort of behaviour
could qualify as sexual harassment.</i>

37:17.110 --> 37:20.580
<i>Really? What's the penalty for that?</i>

37:20.780 --> 37:23.909
<i>Someday you have to make good
on your innuendoes.</i>

37:27.912 --> 37:32.509
<i>- After you, Moneypenny.
- No, I insist. You first.</i>

37:37.213 --> 37:40.262
<i>- Good evening, O07.
- Tanner. What's up?</i>

37:40.383 --> 37:43.057
<i>16 minutes ago,
we intercepted a distress call</i>

37:43.136 --> 37:47.141
<i>from a supposedly abandoned
radar station at Severnaya. Look.</i>

37:51.311 --> 37:56.909
<i>- We found a match. Your missing Tiger.
- In the middle of northern Russia?</i>

37:57.108 --> 38:01.329
<i>Your hunch was right. Too bad the evil
queen of numbers wouldn't let you play it.</i>

38:01.404 --> 38:03.452
<i>Mm-hm.</i>

38:06.493 --> 38:09.497
<i>- You were saying?
- No, no. I was just... just...</i>

38:09.621 --> 38:14.798
<i>Good. Because if I want sarcasm, I'll
talk to my children, thank you very much.</i>

38:15.460 --> 38:17.713
<i>- Good evening, 007.
- Good evening, M.</i>

38:17.796 --> 38:20.925
<i>The prime minister's
waiting for an update.</i>

38:21.007 --> 38:24.056
<i>Proceed with your briefing, Mr Tanner.</i>

38:24.135 --> 38:26.308
<i>Thank you.</i>

38:26.638 --> 38:30.233
<i>Yes, after the distress signal,
your helicopter took off</i>

38:30.391 --> 38:33.144
<i>and the Russians
had three MiGs intercept it.</i>

38:33.228 --> 38:35.731
<i>What do you think the base is used for?</i>

38:35.814 --> 38:38.658
<i>We suspected it might be
the ground station</i>

38:38.775 --> 38:42.575
<i>for a secret space-based
weapon called Go|denEye, but...</i>

38:42.654 --> 38:47.535
<i>Our statistical analysis saw they had
neither the finance nor technology.</i>

38:47.742 --> 38:50.666
<i>Numbers were never my strong suit.</i>

38:51.287 --> 38:53.210
<i>Are these pictures live?</i>

38:53.498 --> 38:57.093
<i>Unlike the American government, we
prefer not to get our bad news from CNN.</i>

39:20.733 --> 39:23.532
<i>Negative so far.
Everything seems normal.</i>

39:32.370 --> 39:34.668
<i>{alarm sounds}</i>

40:26.966 --> 40:29.264
<i>What the bloody hell was that?</i>

40:38.186 --> 40:40.234
<i>Aaaarghhh!</i>

41:08.091 --> 41:09.764
<i>{shrieks}</i>

41:13.513 --> 41:15.811
<i>Aaarghhhh!</i>

41:55.471 --> 41:57.599
<i>Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.</i>

42:00.226 --> 42:02.604
<i>Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova!</i>

42:02.687 --> 42:04.155
<i>{claﬂg}</i>

42:33.384 --> 42:35.432
<i>Aargh!</i>

43:15.593 --> 43:18.938
<i>Boris! Boris!</i>

43:19.931 --> 43:21.353
<i>Thanks.</i>

43:21.432 --> 43:25.812
<i>Our satellite is knocked out.
So are two of the Americans'.</i>

43:26.813 --> 43:31.410
<i>We have another,
coming into range... now.</i>

43:35.196 --> 43:37.290
<i>Good God.</i>

43:38.699 --> 43:40.747
<i>Two of the MiGs are down.</i>

43:40.827 --> 43:43.250
<i>It looks like the third went into the dish.</i>

43:43.579 --> 43:45.377
<i>What do you think?</i>

43:45.540 --> 43:50.546
<i>No lights. Not one single
electric light on in a 30-mile radius.</i>

43:51.879 --> 43:54.598
<i>- EMP?
- It would explain the MiGs and satellites.</i>

43:54.674 --> 43:57.473
<i>- And the blackout.
- Electromagnetic pulse.</i>

43:57.552 --> 44:02.558
<i>- A satellite weapon developed by the...
- Americans and Soviets in the Cold War.</i>

44:02.807 --> 44:04.730
<i>I've read the brief.</i>

44:04.809 --> 44:09.440
<i>Discovered after Hiroshima. Set off
a nuclear device in the upper atmosphere.</i>

44:09.522 --> 44:14.699
<i>Creates a pulse, a radiation surge,
that destroys everything electronic.</i>

44:14.902 --> 44:20.033
<i>The idea being to knock out the enemy's
communications before they can retaliate.</i>

44:21.200 --> 44:23.623
<i>So, Golden Eye exists.</i>

44:24.662 --> 44:26.335
<i>Yes.</i>

44:26.497 --> 44:29.876
<i>- Could this be an accident?
- No. The helicopter.</i>

44:30.168 --> 44:33.422
<i>For stealing the GoldenEye,
it was the perfect getaway vehicle.</i>

44:33.504 --> 44:37.099
<i>Setting off the blast would
wipe out any trace of the crime.</i>

44:37.175 --> 44:41.521
<i>- The Janus group?
- It may be linked to the helicopter.</i>

44:42.555 --> 44:44.603
<i>I know the Russian fail-safe systems.</i>

44:44.682 --> 44:49.859
<i>You just don't walk in and ask for the keys
to the bomb. You need the access codes.</i>

44:52.690 --> 44:54.818
<i>{punches keys}</i>

44:57.111 --> 44:59.614
<i>There had to be an insider.</i>

45:07.371 --> 45:09.999
<i>At least one person
probably knows who it is.</i>

45:14.545 --> 45:17.719
<i>{animal whimpering}</i>

45:18.507 --> 45:21.056
<i>{barking and whining}</i>

45:31.646 --> 45:35.150
<i>Very well, sir. Thank you. Good night.</i>

45:36.901 --> 45:41.702
<i>The prime minister's talked to Moscow. It
was "an accident on a training exercise".</i>

45:41.864 --> 45:44.959
<i>Governments change.
The lies stay the same.</i>

45:45.076 --> 45:47.044
<i>What else do we know about Janus?</i>

45:47.411 --> 45:50.506
<i>Top-flight arms dealers,
headquartered in St Petersburg.</i>

45:50.581 --> 45:53.551
<i>Restocked the Iraqis during the Gulf War.</i>

45:53.626 --> 45:57.005
<i>The head man's unreliably
described. No photographs.</i>

45:57.088 --> 46:00.217
<i>The woman, Onatopp,</i>

46:00.299 --> 46:02.472
<i>is our only confirmed contact.</i>

46:02.718 --> 46:06.268
<i>- Would you care for a drink?
- Thank you.</i>

46:06.764 --> 46:10.394
<i>- Your predecessor kept some cognac...
- I prefer bourbon.</i>

46:10.726 --> 46:13.229
<i>- Ice?
- Yes.</i>

46:20.903 --> 46:25.875
<i>We pulled the files on whoever may have
had access or authority at Severnaya.</i>

46:26.033 --> 46:30.083
<i>The top name on the list's
an old friend of yours, I understand.</i>

46:33.416 --> 46:36.340
<i>Ourumov. They made him a general.</i>

46:36.419 --> 46:39.389
<i>He sees himself as the next
"iron man of Russia".</i>

46:39.463 --> 46:43.434
<i>Our political analysts say
he doesn't ﬁt the profile of a traitor.</i>

46:43.509 --> 46:47.514
<i>Are these the same analysts who said
that Go|denEye couldn't exist?</i>

46:47.638 --> 46:52.644
<i>Who said the helicopter posed no threat
and wasn't worth following?</i>

46:54.061 --> 46:56.905
<i>You don't like me, Bond.
You don't like my methods.</i>

46:56.981 --> 47:01.953
<i>You think I'm an accountant, more
interested in numbers than your instincts.</i>

47:02.320 --> 47:04.414
<i>- The thought had occurred to me.
- Good.</i>

47:04.572 --> 47:07.746
<i>Because I think you're
a sexist, misogynist dinosaur,</i>

47:07.825 --> 47:11.921
<i>a relic of the Cold War, whose
boyish charms, though wasted on me,</i>

47:11.996 --> 47:15.591
<i>obviously appealed to that
young woman I sent out to evaluate you.</i>

47:15.791 --> 47:18.920
<i>- Point taken.
- Not quite, O07.</i>

47:19.503 --> 47:22.723
<i>If you think I don't have the balls
to send a man out to die,</i>

47:22.798 --> 47:25.176
<i>your instincts are dead wrong.</i>

47:25.301 --> 47:28.225
<i>I've no compunction
about sending you to your death.</i>

47:28.346 --> 47:32.897
<i>But I won't do it on a whim, even
with your cavalier attitude towards life.</i>

47:36.604 --> 47:38.606
<i>I want you to find GoldenEye.</i>

47:38.689 --> 47:42.034
<i>Find who took it, what they plan
to do with it, and stop it.</i>

47:42.360 --> 47:44.658
<i>If you come across Ourumov,
guilty or not,</i>

47:44.737 --> 47:50.039
<i>don't run off on a vendetta. Avenging
Alec Trevelyan will not bring him back.</i>

47:50.284 --> 47:55.040
<i>- You didn't get him killed.
- Neither did you. Don't make it personal.</i>

47:55.956 --> 47:57.879
<i>Never.</i>

48:01.337 --> 48:03.385
<i>Bond...</i>

48:05.758 --> 48:07.886
<i>Come back alive.</i>

48:11.806 --> 48:13.524
<i>{military march}</i>

48:34.370 --> 48:36.714
<i>{knock on door}</i>

48:47.883 --> 48:50.762
<i>Good morning, General Ourumov.</i>

48:52.263 --> 48:55.187
<i>Defence Minister Mishkin... Gentlemen.</i>

48:55.266 --> 48:58.065
<i>Please, deliver your report.</i>

49:00.980 --> 49:06.032
<i>As you know, 72 hours ago, a secret
weapons system - codename GoldenEye -</i>

49:06.110 --> 49:08.204
<i>was detonated over Severnaya.</i>

49:08.320 --> 49:12.917
<i>As head of Space Division,
I personally undertook the investigation.</i>

49:12.992 --> 49:17.589
<i>I have concluded this crime was
committed by Siberian separatists</i>

49:17.663 --> 49:20.291
<i>seeking to create political unrest.</i>

49:21.375 --> 49:25.846
<i>Regrettably, the peaceful work and the
hard-currency earnings of Severnaya</i>

49:25.921 --> 49:28.765
<i>have been set back by several years.</i>

49:29.008 --> 49:31.136
<i>Therefore, I tender my resignation.</i>

49:31.635 --> 49:33.729
<i>{protests}</i>

49:34.138 --> 49:37.733
<i>It seems the council does not want
your head, Arkady Grigorovich.</i>

49:37.808 --> 49:41.278
<i>Merely your assurance that
there are no other Go|denEyes.</i>

49:41.353 --> 49:43.981
<i>I can give you that assurance,
Defence Minister.</i>

49:44.064 --> 49:47.068
<i>And what of the two missing
Severnaya technicians?</i>

49:49.987 --> 49:53.833
<i>I was aware only of the one.
Boris Grishenko.</i>

49:53.991 --> 49:57.040
<i>There was a girl also, whose body
was not among the dead.</i>

49:57.119 --> 50:00.339
<i>Natalya Fyodorovna Simonova.
A level-two programmer.</i>

50:00.498 --> 50:03.092
<i>I will investigate immediately.</i>

50:03.501 --> 50:08.553
<i>It would seem presumptuous to blame
this incident on Siberian separatists</i>

50:08.631 --> 50:13.057
<i>before the whereabouts
of your own people are determined.</i>

50:13.677 --> 50:17.352
<i>- Do you agree?
- Yes, Defence Minister.</i>

50:17.890 --> 50:21.110
<i>Thank you for bringing it to my attention.</i>

50:22.436 --> 50:24.530
<i>That will be all.</i>

50:38.285 --> 50:41.880
<i>Morning, Q. Sorry about the leg. Skiing?</i>

50:44.583 --> 50:46.836
<i>Hunting.</i>

50:46.919 --> 50:49.388
<i>Right. Now pay attention, O07.</i>

50:49.713 --> 50:51.465
<i>First, your new car.</i>

50:51.632 --> 50:56.138
<i>BMW. Agile, five forward gears,
all-points radar.</i>

50:56.720 --> 51:01.851
<i>Self-destruct system. And, naturally,
all the usual refinements.</i>

51:02.059 --> 51:05.563
<i>Now, this I'm particularly proud of.</i>

51:05.771 --> 51:08.570
<i>Behind the headlights, Stinger missiles.</i>

51:09.066 --> 51:12.320
<i>Excellent. Just the thing
for unwinding after a rough day.</i>

51:12.403 --> 51:19.082
<i>Need I remind you, O07, that you have
a license to kill, not break the traffic laws.</i>

51:20.327 --> 51:22.204
<i>- I wouldn't think of it.
- Good.</i>

51:22.288 --> 51:25.337
<i>Right. Let's get on
to more practical matters.</i>

51:25.708 --> 51:31.431
<i>A typical leather belt.
Male, size 34, buckle, notch.</i>

51:34.258 --> 51:35.760
<i>Have you finished?</i>

51:35.926 --> 51:37.348
<i>- Yes.
- Good.</i>

51:37.428 --> 51:40.432
<i>- A typical belt...
- Q, I'm familiar with that device.</i>

51:40.514 --> 51:44.860
<i>Not one with a 75-foot
rappelling cord built into the buckle.</i>

51:44.935 --> 51:48.155
<i>Fire, and out shoots a piton,</i>

51:48.564 --> 51:52.194
<i>followed by a high-tensile wire
designed to support your weight.</i>

51:52.276 --> 51:55.530
<i>I see. And what if I need
additional support?</i>

51:55.863 --> 51:58.207
<i>It's tested for one, O07.</i>

52:02.911 --> 52:06.006
<i>Flight 878 to St Petersburg.</i>

52:07.958 --> 52:10.507
<i>X-ray document scanner.</i>

52:11.086 --> 52:13.885
<i>A pen. This is a class 4 grenade.</i>

52:14.298 --> 52:17.518
<i>Three clicks arms the four-second fuse.</i>

52:17.885 --> 52:20.809
<i>Another three disarms it.</i>

52:23.891 --> 52:25.893
<i>How long did you say the fuse was?</i>

52:25.976 --> 52:28.570
<i>Oh, grow up, O07.</i>

52:28.646 --> 52:32.776
<i>- "The pen is mightier than the sword."
- Thanks to me, it is.</i>

52:33.317 --> 52:36.912
<i>Look, let's ask Freddie here
to demonstrate for us.</i>

52:36.987 --> 52:41.663
<i>Here we are. Sorry about this, Fred.
One, two, three.</i>

52:47.873 --> 52:51.047
<i>- Don't say it.
- The writing's on the wall?</i>

52:51.710 --> 52:54.179
<i>Along with the rest of him.</i>

52:54.922 --> 52:57.766
<i>Now, 007, do please try and return...</i>

52:58.926 --> 53:01.054
<i>{clattering}</i>

53:01.136 --> 53:04.731
<i>Do try and return some of this
equipment in pristine order.</i>

53:04.807 --> 53:06.730
<i>Don't touch that! That's my lunch.</i>

53:34.002 --> 53:35.925
<i>In London, April's a spring month.</i>

53:36.004 --> 53:38.678
<i>Oh, yeah? What are you -
the weatherman?</i>

53:39.216 --> 53:41.844
<i>For cryin' out loud.
Another stiff-assed Brit,</i>

53:41.927 --> 53:44.350
<i>with your secret codes and passwords.</i>

53:44.805 --> 53:47.684
<i>One of these days you guys
are gonna learn just to drop it.</i>

53:47.933 --> 53:50.607
<i>Come on. My car's over there.</i>

54:05.325 --> 54:07.999
<i>- After you.
- Thank you.</i>

54:10.289 --> 54:13.088
<i>- Like you said, drop it.
- All right.</i>

54:13.167 --> 54:16.797
<i>In London, April's a spring month.
In St Petersburg, we freeze our butts off.</i>

54:16.879 --> 54:19.758
<i>- Close enough for government work?
- No.</i>

54:20.674 --> 54:23.974
<i>- Show me the rose.
- Please, no.</i>

54:24.261 --> 54:26.730
<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

54:39.109 --> 54:41.532
<i>- "Ml-iffy"?
- Third wife.</i>

54:41.862 --> 54:45.537
<i>- Jack Wade, CIA.
- James Bond, stiff-assed Brit.</i>

54:45.616 --> 54:47.618
<i>- That's a nice move.
- Nice car.</i>

54:47.701 --> 54:51.831
<i>Hasn't let me down yet. She's an ugly
little bitch, but she gets you there.</i>

54:51.914 --> 54:54.633
<i>Hey, Bond. Do you do any gardening?</i>

54:55.042 --> 54:59.218
<i>{announcement in Russian

55:11.642 --> 55:13.690
<i>Can you hand me that wrench, Jimmy?</i>

55:14.686 --> 55:17.815
<i>- So what do you know about Janus?
- Zilch. Zipsky.</i>

55:18.232 --> 55:21.406
<i>No one's ever seen him.
But the man's connected up the kazoo.</i>

55:21.568 --> 55:24.071
<i>KGB, military. Screwdriver.</i>

55:26.532 --> 55:30.253
<i>Rumour has it he lives on
one of those old Soviet missile trains.</i>

55:30.327 --> 55:34.457
<i>That armoured stuff they used to
run around so we couldn't target 'em.</i>

55:34.957 --> 55:37.881
<i>Wanna hand me that hammer, Jimbo?</i>

55:38.168 --> 55:40.421
<i>No, the bigger one. The sledge.</i>

55:40.838 --> 55:44.843
<i>Anyways, to tell the truth,
you don't find this guy. He finds you.</i>

55:45.259 --> 55:47.808
<i>Hell, it's all Russian Mafia.</i>

55:48.262 --> 55:52.017
<i>Best thing I can do is point you
in the direction of his competition.</i>

55:56.061 --> 55:59.656
<i>- Who is the competition?
- An ex-KGB guy. Tough mother.</i>

55:59.731 --> 56:02.234
<i>Limps on his right leg. Name's Zukovsky.</i>

56:02.526 --> 56:04.824
<i>- Valentin Dimitreveych Zukovsky?
- Yeah.</i>

56:05.153 --> 56:07.872
<i>- You know him?
- I gave him the limp.</i>

56:32.890 --> 56:34.688
<i>Yes?</i>

56:35.142 --> 56:38.112
<i>- Are these all you have?
- How many do you want?</i>

56:40.397 --> 56:43.367
<i>24 for the American school,
11 for the Swedish.</i>

56:43.442 --> 56:48.824
<i>IBM-compatible with 500 meg
hard drives, CD-ROM and 14.4 modems.</i>

56:49.865 --> 56:51.959
<i>- You pay dollars?
- Of course.</i>

56:52.200 --> 56:54.202
<i>If madam requires a demonstration...</i>

56:54.494 --> 56:58.499
<i>Madam requires one demonstration
model and a quiet place to test it.</i>

57:13.305 --> 57:14.557
<i>Natalya.</i>

57:19.561 --> 57:21.609
<i>{typing}</i>

57:30.989 --> 57:35.119
<i>- Is everything satisfactory?
- Everything except the interruption.</i>

57:48.131 --> 57:49.974
<i>{Wade} Let me get this straight, Jimmy.</i>

57:50.050 --> 57:53.805
<i>You shot him in the leg,
you stole his car, you took his girl.</i>

57:54.262 --> 57:57.232
<i>And now you want Zukovsky
to set you up with Janus?</i>

57:57.474 --> 58:00.819
<i>- {Bond} Yes.
- Are you gonna appeal to his heart?</i>

58:00.894 --> 58:04.023
<i>- No. His wallet.
- That might work.</i>

58:04.982 --> 58:06.575
<i>OK. Showtime.</i>

58:11.822 --> 58:14.575
<i>Valentin operates
out of building number 23.</i>

58:15.075 --> 58:16.748
<i>Are you sure you wanna do this?</i>

58:16.994 --> 58:22.376
<i>Last guy who dropped in uninvited went
home air freight - in very small boxes.</i>

58:23.333 --> 58:26.507
<i>Make sure they send me home first class.</i>

59:19.973 --> 59:22.601
<i>- {screams}
- Natalya! It's me! It's Boris!</i>

59:22.684 --> 59:24.732
<i>It's Boris. It's Boris. Hello.</i>

59:25.062 --> 59:27.156
<i>Shh-shh-shh.</i>

59:30.609 --> 59:33.453
<i>Another morning shot to hell.</i>

59:34.988 --> 59:39.368
<i>Free-market economy!
I swear it will be the end of me.</i>

59:43.705 --> 59:47.130
<i>Walther PPK, 7.65mm.</i>

59:47.209 --> 59:52.431
<i>Only three men I know use such a gun.
I believe I've killed two of them.</i>

59:52.506 --> 59:56.386
<i>- Lucky me.
- I think not.</i>

59:57.052 --> 01:00:00.056
<i>Ooh-ahh</i>

01:00:00.138 --> 01:00:02.732
<i>{Russian accent} And if you love him</i>

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:03.980
<i>Love him</i>

01:00:04.059 --> 01:00:07.029
<i>Oh, be so proud of him</i>

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:08.196
<i>Of him</i>

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.990
<i>Cos after all</i>

01:00:11.066 --> 01:00:13.569
<i>He's just a man</i>

01:00:16.363 --> 01:00:18.786
<i>{tunelessly} Stand by your man...</i>

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.004
<i>James Bond.</i>

01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:27.959
<i>Charming, sophisticated secret agent.</i>

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:31.670
<i>"Shaken, but not stirred."</i>

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:36.634
<i>I see you haven't lost your
delicate sense of humour, Valentin.</i>

01:00:36.758 --> 01:00:39.102
<i>Or your need for an audience.</i>

01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:43.936
<i>- Who's strangling the cat?
- Strangling a cat?</i>

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:46.234
<i>Stand by your man</i>

01:00:49.729 --> 01:00:52.824
<i>That is Irina, my mistress.</i>

01:00:54.234 --> 01:00:56.737
<i>Very talented girl.</i>

01:00:56.903 --> 01:00:59.281
<i>Irina! Take a hike!</i>

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:09.087
<i>So, Mr Bond, what is it that brings you
to my neighbourhood? Hm?</i>

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:14.471
<i>Still working for MI6, or
have you joined the 21 st century?</i>

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:17.265
<i>I hear the new M is a lady.</i>

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:20.344
<i>I want you to do me a favour.</i>

01:01:21.887 --> 01:01:25.733
<i>He wants me to do him a favour!</i>

01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:32.816
<i>My knee aches every single day.
Twice as bad when it is cold.</i>

01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:36.528
<i>Have you any idea how long
the winter lasts in this country?</i>

01:01:36.902 --> 01:01:39.121
<i>- Tell him, Dimitri.
- It depends...</i>

01:01:39.196 --> 01:01:40.869
<i>Silence!</i>

01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:44.417
<i>For an ex-KGB agent,
you surprise me, Valentin.</i>

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:49.293
<i>Surely you must have realised the skill
was not to hit your knee, but to...</i>

01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:51.712
<i>Miss the rest of you.</i>

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:57.423
<i>- So why did you not kill me?
- Call it professional courtesy.</i>

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:01.768
<i>Then I should extend you
the same courtesy.</i>

01:02:04.554 --> 01:02:08.604
<i>Kirov‘s funeral parlour,
four o'clock this afternoon.</i>

01:02:08.683 --> 01:02:11.937
<i>200 pounds of C4 explosives
hidden in a casket.</i>

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:15.487
<i>Your man drives the hearse in,
the money's exchanged,</i>

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.113
<i>their man drives the hearse out.</i>

01:02:18.193 --> 01:02:20.912
<i>Their man will be arrested
with the explosives.</i>

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:24.996
<i>Your man will make
a miraculous escape with the money.</i>

01:02:25.075 --> 01:02:27.123
<i>Your money.</i>

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:29.921
<i>And what do I owe
for this accommodation?</i>

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:33.633
<i>I want you to set me up... with Janus.</i>

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:38.589
<i>- What has he done to deserve you?
- Stole a helicopter.</i>

01:02:38.672 --> 01:02:42.017
<i>- I have six.
- Three. None that fly.</i>

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:46.145
<i>- Who's counting?
- These aren't just criminals but traitors.</i>

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:51.310
<i>They used the chopper to steal a nuclear
weapon. Killed a lot of innocent Russians.</i>

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:54.112
<i>- What do you expect from a Cossack?
- Who?</i>

01:02:55.146 --> 01:02:58.946
<i>This Janus - I never met the man,
but I know he's a Lienz Cossack.</i>

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:02.363
<i>The group that worked
for the Nazis, Second World War.</i>

01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:05.039
<i>You know your history.
At the end of the war,</i>

01:03:05.115 --> 01:03:08.710
<i>the Lienz Cossacks surrendered
to the British in Austria,</i>

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:13.256
<i>believing they would join them
and wage war against the communists.</i>

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:16.961
<i>But the British betrayed them,
sent them back to Stalin,</i>

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:18.886
<i>who promptly had them all shot.</i>

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.556
<i>Women, children, families.</i>

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:25.810
<i>Not exactly our ﬁnest hour.</i>

01:03:26.136 --> 01:03:29.982
<i>Still, ruthless people.
They got what they deserved.</i>

01:03:30.098 --> 01:03:34.103
<i>I want you to set me up with Janus.
Tell him I'm asking about the chopper.</i>

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:38.531
<i>- You meet me tonight at the Grand Hotel.
- And then you and I are even and...</i>

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:41.743
<i>- he owes me one.
- Precisely.</i>

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:47.050
<i>You don't need the gun... Commander.</i>

01:04:47.258 --> 01:04:51.229
<i>That depends on
your definition of safe sex.</i>

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:58.320
<i>That's close enough.</i>

01:04:58.436 --> 01:05:00.939
<i>Not for what I have in mind.</i>

01:05:12.450 --> 01:05:15.078
<i>{Xenia moans with pleasure}</i>

01:05:18.248 --> 01:05:20.125
<i>{Xenia shrieks}</i>

01:05:24.629 --> 01:05:27.553
<i>Oh, you think you can hurt me?</i>

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:30.135
<i>{laughs}</i>

01:05:34.848 --> 01:05:38.443
<i>- {Bond gasps for breath}
- {Xenia shrieks with pleasure}</i>

01:05:46.693 --> 01:05:48.991
<i>You think you can break me?</i>

01:05:55.034 --> 01:05:57.128
<i>{Bond roars}</i>

01:05:57.203 --> 01:06:00.002
<i>{shrieking} Ah, yes! Yes! Yes!</i>

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:03.256
<i>{Xenia yelps}</i>

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:09.474
<i>No, no, no.</i>

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:12.018
<i>No more foreplay.</i>

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.687
<i>Take me to Janus.</i>

01:06:14.762 --> 01:06:15.763
<i>Buliatch!</i>

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.656
<i>- This is it?
- Yes.</i>

01:06:34.282 --> 01:06:38.458
<i>Well, I must say, I've had a lovely evening.</i>

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:42.541
<i>- You?
- Once again, the pleasure was all yours.</i>

01:06:42.624 --> 01:06:47.004
<i>- You'll understand if I don't call.
- I won't lose sleep over it.</i>

01:06:49.339 --> 01:06:51.387
<i>Sweet dreams.</i>

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:51.909
<i>{Clink}</i>

01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:05.582
<i>Hello, James.</i>

01:08:28.020 --> 01:08:31.491
<i>- Alec?
- Back from the dead.</i>

01:08:31.733 --> 01:08:36.078
<i>No longer just an anonymous star
on the Memorial Wall at MI6.</i>

01:08:36.154 --> 01:08:40.785
<i>What's the matter, James?
No glib remark? No pithy comeback?</i>

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:44.671
<i>- Why?
- {laughs}</i>

01:08:45.455 --> 01:08:48.880
<i>Hilarious question. Particularly from you.</i>

01:08:49.542 --> 01:08:54.799
<i>Did you ever ask why we toppled
all those dictators and regimes,</i>

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:59.227
<i>only to come home - "Well done!
Good job, but sorry, old boy."</i>

01:08:59.385 --> 01:09:02.559
<i>"Everything you risked
your life for has changed."</i>

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:06.359
<i>- It was the job we were chosen for.
- Of course you'd say that.</i>

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.979
<i>James Bond, Her Majesty's loyal terrier,</i>

01:09:10.063 --> 01:09:12.316
<i>defender of the so-called faith.</i>

01:09:12.398 --> 01:09:14.867
<i>Oh, please, James, put it away.</i>

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:18.700
<i>It's insulting to think
I haven't anticipated your every move.</i>

01:09:21.448 --> 01:09:23.247
<i>Yes.</i>

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:30.008
<i>- I trusted you, Alec.
- Trust. What a quaint idea.</i>

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:35.634
<i>How did the MI6 screening miss
that your parents were Lienz Cossacks?</i>

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:39.388
<i>Once again, your faith
is misplaced. They knew.</i>

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:41.845
<i>We're both orphans, James.</i>

01:09:42.261 --> 01:09:46.185
<i>But where your parents had the luxury
of dying in a climbing accident,</i>

01:09:46.265 --> 01:09:49.734
<i>mine survived the British betrayal
and Stalin's execution squads.</i>

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:55.067
<i>But my father couldn't let himself
or my mother live with the shame of it.</i>

01:09:56.651 --> 01:09:59.370
<i>MI6 figured I was too young to remember.</i>

01:10:00.238 --> 01:10:02.536
<i>And in one of life's little ironies,</i>

01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:05.919
<i>the son went to work for
the government whose betrayal</i>

01:10:06.202 --> 01:10:09.706
<i>caused the father to kill
himself and his wife.</i>

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:15.171
<i>Hence Janus, the two-faced
Roman god, come to life.</i>

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:18.223
<i>It wasn't God who gave me this face.</i>

01:10:18.423 --> 01:10:21.973
<i>It was you, setting the timers
for three minutes instead of six.</i>

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:27.433
<i>- Am I supposed to feel sorry for you?
- No. You're supposed to die for me.</i>

01:10:30.518 --> 01:10:32.441
<i>By the WHY</i>

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:37.701
<i>I did think of asking you to join
my little scheme, but somehow I knew</i>

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:40.779
<i>007's loyalty was always
to the mission,</i>

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:43.998
<i>never to his friend.</i>

01:10:45.283 --> 01:10:47.752
<i>Closing time, James. Last call.</i>

01:10:47.952 --> 01:10:49.625
<i>{gunshot}</i>

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:04.765
<i>For England, James.</i>

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:08.268
<i>- {woman} Wake up! Mister!
- {electronic bleeps}</i>

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:09.849
<i>{woman shrieks}</i>

01:11:09.932 --> 01:11:13.186
<i>Wake up, please! Wake up!</i>

01:11:13.269 --> 01:11:15.271
<i>I'm here. I'm here!</i>

01:11:15.354 --> 01:11:18.403
<i>Hurry! Hurry up! Come on!</i>

01:11:19.525 --> 01:11:22.449
<i>Pull yourself together or we're gonna die!</i>

01:11:24.864 --> 01:11:28.744
<i>- Do something! Get us out of here!
- I'm a little tied up!</i>

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.419
<i>Never mind.</i>

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.834
<i>{alarm}</i>

01:12:49.448 --> 01:12:52.702
<i>The things we do
for frequent-flier mileage.</i>

01:12:53.870 --> 01:12:55.998
<i>Here. Let me help you.</i>

01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.708
<i>That's it. Mind your head.</i>

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:08.643
<i>Let me... go!</i>

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.141
<i>{vehicles approaching}</i>

01:13:52.678 --> 01:13:54.180
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:59.686
<i>- Listen. I'm on your side.
- I don't know anything.</i>

01:13:59.769 --> 01:14:01.771
<i>- I don't believe you.
- I don't care.</i>

01:14:01.854 --> 01:14:04.152
<i>Look, they might be back any minute.</i>

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:08.078
<i>Are you with me, or your countrymen
who killed everyone at Severnaya?</i>

01:14:08.152 --> 01:14:10.951
<i>I've never been to Severnaya.</i>

01:14:11.030 --> 01:14:14.375
<i>Your watch has. Frozen
by the Golden Eye blast.</i>

01:14:15.451 --> 01:14:19.001
<i>And I'm willing to bet you're the one
who climbed up the dish to get out.</i>

01:14:20.873 --> 01:14:23.376
<i>- Who are you?
- I work for the British government.</i>

01:14:23.459 --> 01:14:25.962
<i>The more you tell me,
the more I can help you.</i>

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:30.221
<i>- But I don't know anything!
- Then start with what you do know.</i>

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:42.645
<i>My name is Natalya Simonova.</i>

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:46.942
<i>I was a systems programmer
at Severnaya facility until...</i>

01:14:47.024 --> 01:14:49.118
<i>Go on.</i>

01:14:50.403 --> 01:14:53.657
<i>- Until they killed everyone.
- Who? Alec Trevelyan?</i>

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:58.245
<i>- No. I don't know who that is.
- Who's the insider? Who's the traitor?</i>

01:14:58.369 --> 01:15:00.667
<i>Boris. Boris Grishenko.</i>

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:04.676
<i>- KGB or military?
- Computer programmer.</i>

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:08.004
<i>- There was no one else?
- No.</i>

01:15:09.964 --> 01:15:13.093
<i>They're going to kill me, aren't they?</i>

01:15:13.884 --> 01:15:15.978
<i>Trust me.</i>

01:15:17.596 --> 01:15:20.975
<i>Trust you? I don't even know your name.</i>

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.602
<i>{door opens}</i>

01:15:22.852 --> 01:15:25.696
<i>Good morning, Mr Bond. Sit.</i>

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:35.869
<i>I am Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin.</i>

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:39.377
<i>So, by what means shall we
execute you, Commander Bond?</i>

01:15:39.744 --> 01:15:41.542
<i>What, no small talk?</i>

01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.748
<i>No chitchat?</i>

01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:48.466
<i>That's the trouble. No one has time to do
a really sinister interrogation any more.</i>

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:52.466
<i>- It's a lost art.
- Your sense of humour doesn't slay me.</i>

01:15:52.882 --> 01:15:55.135
<i>- Where is the Golden Eye?
- I assumed you had it.</i>

01:15:55.301 --> 01:15:58.851
<i>I have an English spy,
a programmer and a helicopter...</i>

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:02.524
<i>- That's how your traitor wants it to look.
- Who attacked Severnaya?</i>

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.321
<i>- Who had the codes?
- The penalty for terrorism is still death.</i>

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:10.650
<i>- And for treason?
- Stop it, both of you! Stop it.</i>

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:13.236
<i>You're like... boys with toys.</i>

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:21.752
<i>It was Ourumov.
General Ourumov set off the weapon.</i>

01:16:22.036 --> 01:16:24.130
<i>I saw him do it.</i>

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:28.968
<i>- Are you certain it was Ourumov?
- Yes.</i>

01:16:30.086 --> 01:16:32.589
<i>He killed everyone,
then stole the Go|denEye.</i>

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:37.051
<i>And why would he do that?</i>

01:16:37.259 --> 01:16:39.808
<i>There is another satellite.</i>

01:16:42.890 --> 01:16:45.188
<i>Another Golden Eye.</i>

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:48.855
<i>Thank you, Miss Simonova.</i>

01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:52.408
<i>What did you say about
the lost art of interrogation, Mr Bond?</i>

01:16:52.483 --> 01:16:53.905
<i>{door opens}</i>

01:16:53.984 --> 01:16:58.239
<i>Defence Minister, I must protest.
This is my investigation.</i>

01:16:58.322 --> 01:17:01.496
<i>- You are out of order.
- Molcheetye. Molcheech!</i>

01:17:01.575 --> 01:17:05.580
<i>From what I am hearing,
it is you who is out of order.</i>

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:08.041
<i>I've seen this gun
in the hand of our enemy.</i>

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:12.425
<i>- Put it down, General!
- Do you even know who the enemy is?</i>

01:17:12.503 --> 01:17:14.380
<i>- Do you?
- Guard!</i>

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:23.518
<i>Defence Minister Dimitri Mishkin,</i>

01:17:24.682 --> 01:17:28.653
<i>murdered by
British agent James Bond,</i>

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:34.742
<i>himself shot while trying to escape.</i>

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:36.322
<i>Guards!</i>

01:17:47.204 --> 01:17:49.252
<i>Come on!</i>

01:18:29.413 --> 01:18:31.040
<i>They're in the archive!</i>

01:18:35.753 --> 01:18:37.471
<i>Down!</i>

01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:31.393
<i>{Ourumov} Spread out!
Cover the other side!</i>

01:19:31.558 --> 01:19:33.606
<i>Trust me.</i>

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:41.277
<i>{Natalya cries out}</i>

01:19:41.860 --> 01:19:43.407
<i>Argh!</i>

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:12.232
<i>Go now!</i>

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:30.250
<i>{car horn}</i>

01:20:41.712 --> 01:20:43.806
<i>Faster!</i>

01:21:03.859 --> 01:21:06.032
<i>Damn it.</i>

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:14.837
<i>Down the alley!</i>

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:16.394
<i>Use the bumper. That's what it's for.</i>

01:22:29.153 --> 01:22:30.530
<i>Nazad !</i>

01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:37.453
<i>{police siren}</i>

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:42.841
<i>{car horn}</i>

01:23:35.302 --> 01:23:37.396
<i>{police whistle}</i>

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:54.621
<i>What was that?</i>

01:24:31.441 --> 01:24:33.114
<i>Go left!</i>

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:11.816
<i>{tyres squeal}</i>

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.494
<i>Get out!</i>

01:26:07.913 --> 01:26:13.340
<i>Either you've brought me the perfect gift,
or you've made me a very unhappy man.</i>

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:16.297
<i>Mishkin got to them before I could.</i>

01:26:17.214 --> 01:26:19.933
<i>Bond is alive?</i>

01:26:20.008 --> 01:26:22.761
<i>- He escaped.
- Good for Bond.</i>

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:26.564
<i>Bad for you.</i>

01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:31.152
<i>Take a seat, my dear.</i>

01:26:47.619 --> 01:26:50.839
<i>You know, James and I
shared everything.</i>

01:26:52.749 --> 01:26:55.218
<i>Absolutely everything.</i>

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.470
<i>To the victor go the spoils.</i>

01:27:11.351 --> 01:27:13.069
<i>You'll like it where we're going.</i>

01:27:19.860 --> 01:27:21.908
<i>You may even learn to like me.</i>

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:31.455
<i>- Svinya!
' {bleeping}</i>

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:33.415
<i>Stay with her.</i>

01:27:39.504 --> 01:27:42.428
<i>Bond. Only Bond.</i>

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:45.602
<i>He's going to derail us.</i>

01:27:46.428 --> 01:27:48.522
<i>- Full speed!
- Shto?</i>

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:50.390
<i>Full speed! Ram him!</i>

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.443
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

01:27:56.021 --> 01:27:58.524
<i>{train whistle}</i>

01:28:55.956 --> 01:28:58.709
<i>Why can't you just
be a good boy and die?</i>

01:28:58.875 --> 01:29:00.422
<i>You first.</i>

01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:02.596
<i>You... second.</i>

01:29:03.547 --> 01:29:05.220
<i>Up!</i>

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:12.143
<i>Situation analysis... hopeless.</i>

01:29:13.348 --> 01:29:16.318
<i>You have no backup, no escape route.</i>

01:29:16.768 --> 01:29:19.362
<i>And I have the only bargaining chip.</i>

01:29:19.521 --> 01:29:24.027
<i>- Where is she?
- Ah, yes. Your fatal weakness.</i>

01:29:25.694 --> 01:29:28.197
<i>Ourumov, bring her in.</i>

01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:31.783
<i>Lovely girl.</i>

01:29:31.867 --> 01:29:35.497
<i>Tastes like... like strawberries.</i>

01:29:35.829 --> 01:29:37.627
<i>- I wouldn't know.
- I would.</i>

01:29:46.047 --> 01:29:49.051
<i>So, back where we started, James.</i>

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:51.978
<i>Your friend, or the mission?</i>

01:29:52.429 --> 01:29:54.727
<i>Drop the gun. I'll let her live.</i>

01:29:58.268 --> 01:30:02.865
<i>Ourumov... what has
this Cossack promised you?</i>

01:30:03.982 --> 01:30:07.327
<i>You knew, didn't you?
He's a Lienz Cossack.</i>

01:30:07.402 --> 01:30:12.203
<i>- It's in the past.
- He'll betray you! Just like everyone else.</i>

01:30:12.866 --> 01:30:15.369
<i>- ls this true?
- What's true is that in 48 hours,</i>

01:30:15.452 --> 01:30:18.581
<i>you and I will have
more money than God</i>

01:30:18.955 --> 01:30:22.255
<i>and Mr Bond here will have
a small memorial service,</i>

01:30:22.542 --> 01:30:26.763
<i>with only Moneypenny and a few
tearful restaurateurs in attendance.</i>

01:30:27.964 --> 01:30:31.093
<i>So, what's the choice, James?</i>

01:30:31.551 --> 01:30:35.272
<i>Two targets, time enough for one shot.</i>

01:30:35.764 --> 01:30:37.892
<i>The girl, or the mission?</i>

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:40.943
<i>Kill her. She means nothing to me.</i>

01:30:44.147 --> 01:30:45.865
<i>See you in hell, James.</i>

01:30:57.077 --> 01:31:01.708
<i>- One-inch armour plating.
- I'm fine, thank you very much!</i>

01:31:06.503 --> 01:31:08.801
<i>Boris. Yes!</i>

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:12.510
<i>- What are you doing?
- Boris is on-line backing up his files.</i>

01:31:12.592 --> 01:31:16.938
<i>If I can spike him, I might be able
to find out where they're going.</i>

01:31:18.723 --> 01:31:22.569
<i>- Don't stand there! Get us out of here!
- Yes, sir.</i>

01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:42.838
<i>{Alec} Good luck with the floor, James.</i>

01:31:42.914 --> 01:31:46.669
<i>I set the timers for six minutes -
the same six minutes you gave me.</i>

01:31:47.585 --> 01:31:50.179
<i>It was the least I could do for a friend.</i>

01:31:52.424 --> 01:31:55.598
<i>- What does that mean?
- We've got three minutes.</i>

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:31.675
<i>- What else do you call your bottom?
- What?</i>

01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:35.851
<i>Boris' password. He plays word games
"What I sit on but don't take with me."</i>

01:32:35.925 --> 01:32:38.895
<i>- Chair.
- Like I said...</i>

01:32:43.224 --> 01:32:44.350
<i>{Bond} 30 seconds.</i>

01:32:44.434 --> 01:32:48.064
<i>{Natalya} He's not in Russia,
Germany, Paris, London, Madrid,</i>

01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:51.275
<i>- 25 seconds.
- New York, Toronto, Chicago,</i>

01:32:51.357 --> 01:32:53.325
<i>- San Francisco...
- 20 seconds!</i>

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.745
<i>Mexico City, Rio, Miami...</i>

01:33:01.868 --> 01:33:05.668
<i>- Come on!
- Wait! He's in Cuba. Havana - no.</i>

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:08.257
<i>NOW!</i>

01:33:27.685 --> 01:33:31.030
<i>Do you destroy
every vehicle you get into?</i>

01:33:31.106 --> 01:33:33.825
<i>Standard operating procedure.</i>

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.454
<i>Boys with toys.</i>

01:33:40.198 --> 01:33:44.078
<i>Maybe I should take care of
the transportation for our trip to Cuba.</i>

01:33:45.286 --> 01:33:46.629
<i>Our trip?</i>

01:33:46.871 --> 01:33:50.000
<i>Do you know how to disarm the weapon?</i>

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:55.509
<i>I suppose that depends on what kind of
weapon you're talking about disarming.</i>

01:33:57.465 --> 01:34:03.814
<i>So... tell me. Are there any other
standard operating procedures</i>

01:34:04.264 --> 01:34:06.767
<i>I should be aware of, Commander?</i>

01:34:11.938 --> 01:34:13.690
<i>Thousands.</i>

01:34:13.773 --> 01:34:16.322
<i>But I only pay them</i>

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:18.954
<i>lip service.</i>

01:34:41.885 --> 01:34:45.515
<i>My whole life I dreamed
about coming to the Caribbean.</i>

01:34:45.847 --> 01:34:47.849
<i>It's so beautiful.</i>

01:34:47.932 --> 01:34:50.185
<i>Not another human being in sight.</i>

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:52.362
<i>{fast bleeping}</i>

01:35:03.364 --> 01:35:06.117
<i>What is it with you and moving vehicles?</i>

01:35:31.017 --> 01:35:36.148
<i>Yo, Jimbo! Brought a little gift
from old... whatshisname? T? Z?</i>

01:35:36.231 --> 01:35:37.778
<i>_ Q_
- Yeah.</i>

01:35:37.982 --> 01:35:41.612
<i>- What are you doing here, Wade?
- Banyan trees.</i>

01:35:41.819 --> 01:35:45.323
<i>Uh... lam not here. The CIA has
no knowledge, no involvement.</i>

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:49.081
<i>Nothing to do with your insertion
into Cuba, if you catch my drift.</i>

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.787
<i>Mm-hm. Yes, I do.</i>

01:35:51.162 --> 01:35:53.585
<i>Borrowed the plane
from a friend in the DEA.</i>

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:56.176
<i>The Coast Guard and the FAA
are in the loop.</i>

01:35:56.251 --> 01:35:58.925
<i>You're cleared on our radar
for 0600 hours.</i>

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.343
<i>Here's the latest sat-int from Langley.</i>

01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:05.268
<i>- Stay below 600 feet.
- 500 feet.</i>

01:36:05.551 --> 01:36:07.895
<i>- Who's that?
- Natalya Simonova.</i>

01:36:07.971 --> 01:36:11.020
<i>- Sim-yo-nova.
- Russian minister of transportation.</i>

01:36:11.099 --> 01:36:13.193
<i>{Wade clears throat}</i>

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:16.654
<i>Did you check her out?</i>

01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:19.153
<i>- Head to toe.
- Right...</i>

01:36:21.526 --> 01:36:25.702
<i>So, you're lookin' for a dish the size
of a football ﬁeld, huh? Doesn't exist.</i>

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:29.375
<i>- Light a cigar in Cuba and we see it.
- I know it's there.</i>

01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:34.206
<i>It's a duplicate of Severnaya, like
your secret transmitters in New Zealand.</i>

01:36:34.455 --> 01:36:37.129
<i>I've never been there.
How does she know about that?</i>

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:40.462
<i>- What if I need backup?
- Get on the radio. I'll send in the marines.</i>

01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:44.974
<i>Anyway, hang a left
at the end of the runway.</i>

01:36:45.091 --> 01:36:47.719
<i>- Cuba's 80 miles on your right.
- Yo, Wade!</i>

01:36:52.265 --> 01:36:55.314
<i>Just one thing. Don't push
any of the buttons on that car.</i>

01:36:55.810 --> 01:36:58.814
<i>- I'm just gonna bomb around in it.
- Exactly.</i>

01:36:59.522 --> 01:37:02.321
<i>Yo, James. I got faith, but be careful.</i>

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:06.617
<i>- He knows you're comin'.
- {starts engine}</i>

01:38:08.424 --> 01:38:11.018
<i>He was your friend - Trevelyan.</i>

01:38:12.887 --> 01:38:15.891
<i>And now he's your enemy
and you will kill him.</i>

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:19.857
<i>It is that simple?</i>

01:38:21.062 --> 01:38:23.110
<i>In a word, yes.</i>

01:38:24.399 --> 01:38:26.572
<i>- Unless he kills you first.
- Natalya...</i>

01:38:26.651 --> 01:38:31.578
<i>You think I'm impressed? With your guns,
your killing, your death. For what?</i>

01:38:31.948 --> 01:38:34.451
<i>So you can be a hero?</i>

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:38.000
<i>- All the heroes I know are dead.
- Natalya...</i>

01:38:38.079 --> 01:38:41.299
<i>How can you act like this?
How can you be so cold?</i>

01:38:43.376 --> 01:38:46.095
<i>It's what keeps me alive.</i>

01:38:47.213 --> 01:38:50.387
<i>No. It's what keeps you alone.</i>

01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:31.849
<i>James...</i>

01:51:51.788 --> 01:51:54.541
<i>- Ingenious.
- Thank you, James.</i>

01:51:54.875 --> 01:51:57.594
<i>But it still boils down to petty theft.</i>

01:51:58.587 --> 01:52:02.808
<i>In the end, you're just a bank robber.
Nothing more than a common thief.</i>

01:52:13.268 --> 01:52:15.771
<i>You always did have
a small mind, James.</i>

01:52:16.438 --> 01:52:21.569

01:52:43.298 --> 01:52:47.895
<i>Oh, please, James! Spare me the Freud.
I might as well ask you</i>

<i>if all the vodka martinis ever silence
the screams of all the men you've killed.</i>

A second-level programmer.</i>

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.771
<i>- {Alec} Deal with it!
- She changed the access codes!</i>

01:54:55.222 --> 01:54:57.725
<i>Then she can fix it.</i>

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:04.235
<i>Go ahead. Shoot him.
He means nothing to me.</i>

01:55:05.607 --> 01:55:08.702
<i>I can do it! I can break her codes!</i>

01:55:08.777 --> 01:55:11.280
<i>Then get on with it!</i>

01:55:38.974 --> 01:55:41.147

01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:45.064

Give them to me!</i>
