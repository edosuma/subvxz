(announcer)
Next is a Bravo
scripted original series.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.007
I want to thank each
and every one of you

00:07.041 --> 00:10.578
for coming out today--
Simone, Stephanie.

00:10.611 --> 00:13.414
Annabelle, you came
all the way from Greenwich.

00:13.447 --> 00:16.850
And I want to thank Jill
for heroically swooping in

00:16.884 --> 00:20.088
at the last minute
to host my Sip n' See.

00:20.121 --> 00:23.824
My mother-in-law Candace
was originally supposed to host

00:23.857 --> 00:29.063
at her penthouse, which is
much larger and not a walk-up,

00:29.097 --> 00:33.033
but she decided that
her back hurt too much.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.036
We're just grateful
that she's still alive

00:36.070 --> 00:39.039
to see her seventh grandchild,
Langley.

00:39.073 --> 00:40.508
(all)
Aw!

00:40.541 --> 00:45.846
Jill, you've truly become...

00:45.879 --> 00:48.449
my touchstone,

00:48.482 --> 00:50.718
- my rock.
- Thank you, Brooke.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.221
- [sobs]
- If you had told me a month ago

00:53.254 --> 00:54.988
that I'd be hosting
your Sip n' See,

00:55.022 --> 00:57.891
I would've said,
"what the hell is a Sip n' See?"

00:57.925 --> 01:00.961
But here we are,
sippin' and seein'.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.164
Where is that little nugget
Langley anyway?

01:03.197 --> 01:04.365
Asleep.

01:06.134 --> 01:10.904
Okay, well,
enjoy the Sip n' See. Okay.

01:10.938 --> 01:13.574
* Hey, yes, you know

01:13.607 --> 01:17.511
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:20.881 --> 01:23.151
Talk to me, broha.
Are you ready

01:23.151 --> 01:27.054
to officially become
a full-on Hercules employee?

01:27.155 --> 01:28.789
Oh, I know, I know,
I gotta roll over my 401K.

01:28.822 --> 01:31.225
No, no, no,
I'm talking about the executive

01:31.259 --> 01:32.826
orientation package.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.628
The usual starter order,

01:34.662 --> 01:35.629
ten custom suits,

01:35.663 --> 01:37.231
- five pairs of shoes.
- Oh, no.

01:37.265 --> 01:40.901
It's part of the welcome package
for everyone, except assistants.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.871
Oh.

01:43.904 --> 01:46.374
Well, okay.
[laughs]

01:46.407 --> 01:47.875
Uh, since I have you, look,
let's go over

01:47.908 --> 01:50.010
these proposed tax amendments
on exports to China.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.345
Let's not
and say we did.

01:51.379 --> 01:54.482
Your only job right now
is becoming Herculean

01:54.515 --> 01:55.883
from the outside in.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.185
It's 11:00 a.m.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.920
Not in China it ain't.
Gan Bei.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.022
[clinking glasses]

02:04.558 --> 02:06.327
Whoo!
That's what I'm talking about.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.830
Kira, remove this man's shirt
and his pants.

02:09.863 --> 02:12.966
Candace, oh, is it your back?
I have Motrin.

02:13.000 --> 02:17.205
Uh, no, no, no, no, I never
accept strangers' medication.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.972
I learned that
the hard way in Japan

02:19.006 --> 02:21.108
after I popped a pill
and woke up the prize

02:21.209 --> 02:23.211
in a fan dancing
competition.

02:23.211 --> 02:27.047
Jill?
K-keep taking pictures, please.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.582
And Simone needs
a refill.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.818
Absolutely, on it.
Okay.

02:30.851 --> 02:35.889
Well, I guess I should go
check on the baby nurse,

02:35.923 --> 02:40.494
and also the baby...
Langley.

02:43.797 --> 02:47.301
I'm going to say
what everybody's thinking.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.136
Langley is a dog's name.

02:51.505 --> 02:53.641
More baby-tinis anyone?
(all) Yes.

02:53.674 --> 02:54.908
Okay.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.382
In love.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.484
Balenciaga.
Gap kids.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.923
You ladies are fishies.
Okay.

03:14.127 --> 03:16.530
Jared is so
into anal right now.

03:16.564 --> 03:19.132
I never thought I'd say this,
but I miss blowjobs.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.068
Mm. my husband's
suddenly interested

03:21.101 --> 03:23.103
in l'autre passage too.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.138
At least I get to hold
the remote during anal.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.474
Yeah.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.008
Last week we did it so much,
I watched all of The Help.

03:28.041 --> 03:32.112
Wait, you guys are taking it
in the chocolate starfish?

03:32.145 --> 03:33.146
You're not?

03:33.180 --> 03:34.548
Hell to the no!

03:34.582 --> 03:36.784
There's, like,
a Ghostbuster sign back there.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.919
Wait,
you've never done anal?

03:38.952 --> 03:40.721
Wow, I have a friend
at the Style section

03:40.754 --> 03:42.690
that would love
to do a story on you.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.092
Why am I the last to know
about all this hooker stuff

03:45.125 --> 03:46.927
that then becomes
wifely duties?

03:46.960 --> 03:49.397
Jill, don't you want
your man to have you

03:49.430 --> 03:51.465
in every way possible?

03:51.499 --> 03:53.534
I'm pretty sure
he's happy

03:53.567 --> 03:55.669
with the 1 1/2 ways
I've been offering.

03:55.703 --> 03:56.670
Mm.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.672
Okay, what are you hens
clucking about?

03:58.706 --> 04:00.107
Oh, nothing.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.909
Just anal sex.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.377
French third base?

04:04.878 --> 04:08.649
I'm very familiar.
[laughs]

04:08.682 --> 04:12.119
And now,
that endless stairwell.

04:12.152 --> 04:15.823
Good-bye, girls.

04:15.856 --> 04:16.957
[mouthing words]
Oh, my God.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.894
[quirky funk music]

04:20.928 --> 04:24.231
[siren blaring]

04:24.332 --> 04:27.234
[sound distorting]

04:27.335 --> 04:29.737
*

04:29.770 --> 04:33.106
[car horn honking]

04:43.183 --> 04:44.752
Just got the good news.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.920
Rutherford
got into McAllister School.

04:46.954 --> 04:48.789
Gotta love
early sibling acceptance.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.959
I almost forgot today was
sibling notification day.

04:51.992 --> 04:54.395
I really hope Dottie
gets into Hazel's school,

04:54.428 --> 04:56.697
then at least one of my twins
will be set.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.198
She'll get in.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.601
Lynn's kids started masturbating
with castanets in her interview,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.470
and she still got into
her big sister's school.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.372
[phone ringing]

05:04.405 --> 05:07.841
Oh, it's Chloe's school.
Yes? She did?

05:07.875 --> 05:09.610
Oh, okay, good,
thank you.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.512
[phone ringing]

05:11.545 --> 05:12.946
Hello?

05:12.980 --> 05:14.382
Thank you!
We're thrilled

05:14.382 --> 05:15.949
to have two children
at Nightingale.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.050
[phone ringing]

05:17.084 --> 05:18.185
Oh, my phone.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.787
Ah.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.922
It's Hazel's School.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.259
Hello?
Yes, this is she.

05:29.797 --> 05:33.133
Oh.
Um, okay.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.405
Thanks for letting me know.

05:37.405 --> 05:40.741
Do you guys want topped-off
or any more drinks or it's okay?

05:40.774 --> 05:42.743
Oh, no!

05:42.776 --> 05:44.412
It's--it's fine.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.313
Sweetie!

05:46.414 --> 05:48.416
Oh!

05:48.416 --> 05:49.717
Oh.

05:53.521 --> 05:55.456
[ringtone]

05:55.489 --> 05:56.657
Talk to me!

05:56.690 --> 05:59.727
"Talk to me?" Okay,
we'll deal with that later.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.095
Dottie did not
get into Hazel's school.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.163
What?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.598
No way.

06:04.632 --> 06:06.700
Wait, am I on speaker?
Is that Lex?

06:06.734 --> 06:08.001
Do you guys need
some privacy?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.738
Because that, like,
really blows.

06:10.771 --> 06:13.774
No, I should
get back to the party.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.310
[ringtone]

06:17.344 --> 06:19.913
Hey. Aren't you hosting that
slip and slide thing right now?

06:19.947 --> 06:22.783
It's a Sip n' See, and yes,
that's why I'm calling.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.251
I'm beyond miz.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.286
Ugh, I begged you
not to do this.

06:26.319 --> 06:28.589
I didn't have a choice.
Brooke was literally weeping

06:28.622 --> 06:31.091
into the phone
when Candace bailed on hosting.

06:31.124 --> 06:33.761
I was trying to be polite.
I didn't think she'd accept.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.929
So what's so horrible?
Is she lobbing

06:35.963 --> 06:38.331
passive aggressive grenades
about your fridge again?

06:38.365 --> 06:39.933
No, she's been
bizarro warm

06:39.967 --> 06:42.169
ever since I delivered
her baby.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.472
But she just smothered me
with pity hugs

06:44.472 --> 06:48.175
when I told her that Dottie
didn't get into Hazel's School.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.478
What?
I'm gonna egg that place.

06:50.511 --> 06:54.682
Thanks, but my point is that
Brooke is a master manipulator.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.216
She's not a real friend.

06:56.249 --> 06:58.619
I mean, it's like 7th grade
all over again,

06:58.652 --> 07:01.622
when Shawna Goldstone decided
we were BFFs so she could

07:01.655 --> 07:04.725
copy my homework and steal
frozen Kit Kats from my house.

07:04.758 --> 07:08.228
Jill, you have a real BFF who
only copied your homework once,

07:08.261 --> 07:10.631
that time I tried to do
my own taxes.

07:10.664 --> 07:12.766
It was so much easier
when Brooke treated me

07:12.800 --> 07:14.334
like gum on her shoe.

07:14.367 --> 07:18.005
I mean, now I actually care
what she thinks of me. Why?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.907
Honey, please don't go
off the deep end about this.

07:19.940 --> 07:22.075
Just get through the party,
keep your sense of humor,

07:22.109 --> 07:24.044
and put the cake down.
Okay? I gotta go.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.680
Love you.

07:26.714 --> 07:32.385
How did she know
I was eating cake?

07:32.419 --> 07:34.588
Thank you, Akira.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.756
And now...

07:35.789 --> 07:40.661
for the final step in
your Herculean makeover,

07:40.694 --> 07:45.332
Melody, Andy.
Andy, Melody.

07:56.109 --> 07:58.145
[door opening]
- Betty, people are asking--

07:58.178 --> 07:59.947
Brooke,
there you are.

07:59.980 --> 08:04.184
Betty had to use the bathroom.
I said I'd cover.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.987
Oh, well, everyone's dying
to see baby Langley.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.556
Look at that face!

08:08.556 --> 08:10.991
You mean that acne.
It's like I'm looking

08:11.024 --> 08:13.393
at Bill Gates' 9th grade
yearbook photo.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.763
I wish I could just
store her away

08:15.796 --> 08:20.267
and pick her up in five months,
like my winter furs.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.202
Just get her away from me.

08:22.235 --> 08:26.206
You can let people see her,
but be quick about it.

08:26.239 --> 08:29.577
Here, put this hat
on her.

08:29.577 --> 08:32.780
There we go,
just like that.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.715
Okay, don't want to smother
your newborn, so--

08:34.748 --> 08:37.050
Oh, no, no, no, you're fine.
A little lower.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.186
Okay, I just don't want her
to suffocate.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.354
It's okay, much better.

08:41.388 --> 08:45.025
Okay.
Who wants to meet baby Langley?

08:45.058 --> 08:47.060
(all)
Aw!

08:51.665 --> 08:55.235
Well, thanks for coming.
Whoo!

08:55.268 --> 08:59.873
I guess all I have left to do
is clean up this war zone.

09:01.441 --> 09:06.379
[sobs]

09:06.413 --> 09:11.184
I'm sorry.
I'm thinking about Langley.

09:11.218 --> 09:14.321
Her hair is coming in brown.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.623
No offense.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.124
Listen,
a lot of women

09:17.157 --> 09:20.628
go through post partum
depression, even celebrities.

09:20.628 --> 09:22.696
Actually,
especially celebrities.

09:22.730 --> 09:23.897
And me.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.967
I was like a fountain
soda machine of tears and snot

09:27.000 --> 09:29.369
after the twins,
and then I got help.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.204
Maybe this will
cheer you up.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.741
Candace basically announced
to the whole party

09:33.774 --> 09:35.342
that she's done anal.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.409
Who hasn't?

09:36.443 --> 09:38.111
Me!

09:38.145 --> 09:40.313
I've had poos
that make me weep.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.415
Lex and I don't even use
the other hole.

09:42.449 --> 09:44.852
Not that we've had sex
since the baby.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.054
But this is Candace
we're talking about.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.657
By the way, did she seem
a little out of it to you?

09:49.690 --> 09:50.891
Please.
She should win

09:50.924 --> 09:53.226
a daytime Emmy
for that "sore back,

09:53.260 --> 09:55.929
I'm suddenly old and crippled"
routine.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.699
The woman is
a raging narcissist.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.101
I can spot 'em a mile away.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.871
She just couldn't stand to have
a day that was all about me.

10:03.904 --> 10:06.173
And Langley.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.041
Right.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.710
Candace is fine.

10:12.012 --> 10:16.416
Wow, Barbara Walters really
isn't handling retirement well.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.093
[phone ringing]

10:26.126 --> 10:27.961
Mrs. Von Weber.

10:27.995 --> 10:29.930
It's me,
Jill's friend Vanessa.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.800
We met at the wedding.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.335
And Miles' Bris.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.304
And all of their
birthday parties.

10:37.337 --> 10:38.906
- Victoria!
- No.

10:38.939 --> 10:40.874
What are you doing here
dressed like a doctor?

10:40.908 --> 10:45.345
Oh, it's Vanessa,
and I am a doctor.

10:45.378 --> 10:48.782
Oh. Oh, this says
you're a vagrant

10:48.816 --> 10:51.819
ODing on what looks
like three Vicodin

10:51.852 --> 10:53.653
and enough alcohol
to sterilize a subway car.

10:53.687 --> 10:54.654
What happened?

10:54.688 --> 10:57.390
I injured my back
whilst making love...

10:57.424 --> 10:59.059
with my lover.

10:59.092 --> 11:02.362
That's right,
I'm in love, with a lover.

11:02.395 --> 11:04.431
- Um--
- And we make love.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.900
Okay, and is that where
the painkillers came in?

11:06.934 --> 11:09.402
Yes, and I may have had
too many spirits

11:09.436 --> 11:12.039
at Jill's apartment,
but I had to drink,

11:12.072 --> 11:14.407
or I'd think of my grandchildren
sharing a room

11:14.441 --> 11:16.409
and I'd get emotional.

11:16.443 --> 11:17.911
I have to go.

11:17.945 --> 11:20.213
Oh, there's no way
you can stand

11:20.247 --> 11:21.815
with that much gin
in your blood.

11:21.849 --> 11:24.651
Also for an OD, we can't release
you without a psych consult,

11:24.752 --> 11:27.187
so sleep this off
while you wait for a--

11:27.220 --> 11:29.189
Ooh.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.759
Okay, that's good.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.598
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.000
You hangin' in there?

11:40.033 --> 11:42.770
Yeah, there may not be a place
for Dottie in kindergarten,

11:42.803 --> 11:45.405
but there's a place for her
in heaven.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.307
My daughter's alive.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.810
She just didn't
get into Hazel's school.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.444
It's not the end
of the world, guys.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.913
That's the spirit.

11:52.946 --> 11:55.082
(Stephanie) It is just so sad.
(Simone) It's so sad.

11:58.852 --> 12:00.387
That woman you sent.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.790
Oh, she give you the, uh,
full treatment there?

12:02.790 --> 12:06.827
It's not funny and it can't
ever happen again ever.

12:06.860 --> 12:08.395
How am I supposed to explain
this to Jill?

12:08.428 --> 12:10.898
This is all part
of the good life, bro.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.901
You'll get used to it.

12:16.169 --> 12:18.271
Still no psych resident?

12:18.305 --> 12:22.142
Just sitting here
like an immigrant on ObamaCare.

12:23.576 --> 12:29.482
Valerie, forgot how times have
changed and your kind can marry.

12:29.516 --> 12:30.818
Who's the lucky lady?

12:30.851 --> 12:33.053
Not gay, not married.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.721
I've just been wearing
this here lately

12:34.822 --> 12:37.324
because drunk dudes
facing their own mortality

12:37.357 --> 12:41.161
find me irresistible.
It's just easier if I'm married.

12:41.194 --> 12:43.563
I never found anything easier
when I was married.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.333
Wait, didn't your husband die
in a tragic accident?

12:46.366 --> 12:47.734
Yes.
You know,

12:47.835 --> 12:51.071
he wanted to go swimming
with great white sharks

12:51.104 --> 12:52.840
and got eaten
by one of them.

12:52.840 --> 12:56.844
And don't you dare tell
Jill this, but every year,

12:56.877 --> 13:00.347
on our anniversary,
I watch Jaws,

13:00.380 --> 13:02.850
and I laugh my ass off.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.952
[both laughing]
- Okay.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.019
[phone ringing]

13:06.053 --> 13:08.721
Excuse me just a minute,
I have to take this.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.123
Dr. Wrigley.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.860
Hey, what's the haps?
You're four minutes late.

13:12.860 --> 13:17.164
Yes, there's been a delay,
but I can be there momentarily.

13:17.197 --> 13:20.567
Oh. Oh, code.
Celebrity patient?

13:20.600 --> 13:21.601
Copy that.

13:24.604 --> 13:27.307
Was it an actress?

13:27.340 --> 13:29.442
Reality star?

13:29.476 --> 13:30.443
Podcast celebrity?

13:30.477 --> 13:31.578
- I'm not saying.
- Come on,

13:31.611 --> 13:33.113
you know everything
on that menu.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.314
You're just torturing me.

13:34.347 --> 13:35.682
[text alert]

13:35.715 --> 13:38.751
Okay, I just got another batch
of emoji hearts from Brooke.

13:38.785 --> 13:40.988
You realize you don't
have to instantly respond

13:41.021 --> 13:42.489
to all of her texts
and emojis, right?

13:42.522 --> 13:44.457
[text alert]

13:44.491 --> 13:46.659
Now she's putting in a good word
at Shipley's School

13:46.693 --> 13:48.996
and sending us Rutherford's
interview coach.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.932
It's like she's suddenly
so into me.

13:51.965 --> 13:53.366
Looks like the feeling
is mutual.

13:53.400 --> 13:54.467
[text alert]

13:54.501 --> 13:56.937
Okay, now she just sent
frowny faces,

13:56.970 --> 13:59.306
a gun,
and a soft serve sh*á swirl.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.275
Did I mention she's total
post-partum-palooza?

14:02.309 --> 14:04.077
Jill, I'm about
to confiscate that.

14:04.111 --> 14:07.014
Okay, okay, sorry, so rude.
[exhales]

14:07.047 --> 14:09.449
Have lunch with your phone,
babe, I could go.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.951
She just has this power
over me.

14:10.984 --> 14:12.519
She's Lucifer
in white jeggings.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.087
Stop feeding the beast.

14:14.121 --> 14:15.688
You're right.
Please forgive.

14:15.722 --> 14:19.927
For the rest of the day,
I will be 100% Brooke free.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.094
On my nut sack.

14:21.128 --> 14:24.431
[text alerts]

14:24.464 --> 14:26.666
Thank God you could
meet me.

14:26.699 --> 14:29.769
You're the only person I can
talk to about this stuff.

14:29.802 --> 14:33.540
I still just feel so distant
from Langley.

14:33.573 --> 14:37.310
Have you ever considered
holding her?

14:37.344 --> 14:40.413
Jill, you're so crunchy.

14:40.447 --> 14:43.516
Even breast feeding's
atrocious this time around.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.218
It's physically painful.

14:45.252 --> 14:48.188
Okay, I'm the only one
that's gonna tell you this,

14:48.221 --> 14:50.958
but if the nursing's
making you miserable, ditch it.

14:50.958 --> 14:54.327
I can't.
I need Langley to be smart,

14:54.361 --> 14:55.862
especially
with that face.

14:55.963 --> 14:58.966
I didn't breastfeed my kids
and they're smart.

15:00.968 --> 15:03.570
God, Jill, I've been
so self involved,

15:03.603 --> 15:06.573
I completely forgot
all about your issues.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.041
Poor Dottie.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.677
And I'm worried
about your sex life.

15:10.710 --> 15:11.979
Have you given
any more thought

15:11.979 --> 15:13.646
to popping your
back door cherry?

15:13.680 --> 15:15.582
I don't know if Andy
would go for it.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.718
You've had three kids,
no C-sections.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.988
Can either of you
even feel sex anymore?

15:21.021 --> 15:23.390
Yes, Brooke.
We're doing okay.

15:23.423 --> 15:27.760
My point is, Andy will
want to try anal.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.797
And if he doesn't, then
you've got other problems.

15:30.830 --> 15:33.233
Okay, I can't believe
I'm asking this,

15:33.266 --> 15:36.669
but any advice
for a first timer?

15:36.703 --> 15:40.607
Just one word.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.018
Since when do you sleep
in pajamas?

15:52.185 --> 15:53.853
Oh, I just felt like it.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.823
Well, I have a surprise
for you.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.826
Not sure I can handle
a surprise tonight, honey.

15:59.859 --> 16:01.928
Ta-da!

16:03.130 --> 16:06.633
I'm offering you
my ass virginity.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.903
Oh.
Um...

16:10.937 --> 16:12.405
No, thank you.

16:12.439 --> 16:15.242
"No, thank you"?
I heard it's fun.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.177
Babe, uh, uh...

16:17.210 --> 16:18.811
No means no.
[chuckles]

16:18.845 --> 16:20.080
"No means no"?

16:20.113 --> 16:21.114
[sighs]

16:21.148 --> 16:23.783
Like, tonight,
or no means no forever?

16:23.816 --> 16:25.452
Just not feeling
very well.

16:26.453 --> 16:27.554
Sorry.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.589
It's fine.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.292
I had a rough day
at the office.

16:35.062 --> 16:38.765
At last, Sleeping Beauty
awakens.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.667
I said egg whites.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.302
Oh, I'm not room service.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.437
You're still at the hospital.
We tried to wake you

16:44.471 --> 16:47.074
for your psych eval twice,
but we all thought

16:47.107 --> 16:50.177
it was safer for everyone
if you slept it off.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.579
So let's just do this,
you and I. Shall we?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.281
[groans]

16:55.582 --> 16:57.984
How often do you think
about your own death?

16:58.085 --> 16:59.252
Daily.

16:59.286 --> 17:00.653
You think about your own death
on a daily basis?

17:00.687 --> 17:03.356
Oh, I'm constantly
planning my funeral.

17:03.390 --> 17:07.094
It's gonna be at the St. Regis,
luncheon immediately following.

17:07.094 --> 17:10.963
And take this down, if anybody
serves those frozen mini quiches

17:10.997 --> 17:13.200
I'm gonna rise up
out of my coffin and--

17:13.233 --> 17:15.635
Mrs. Von Weber, we're not
party planning.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.004
This is an evaluation
for suicide risk.

17:18.105 --> 17:22.575
But that's obviously
not your problem.

17:22.609 --> 17:26.113
Darling, it's just
that wedding ring.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.615
Plenty of eligible
concussed men

17:28.648 --> 17:31.118
must come through that door
every day.

17:31.118 --> 17:34.221
I just hate to see you
cut yourself off from true love.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.988
[laughs]
I'm almost 40.

17:36.022 --> 17:38.491
I think I've aged out
of the true love fantasy.

17:38.525 --> 17:42.129
I'm almost 50
and I found it.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.464
The more of a catch you are,
the longer it takes

17:44.497 --> 17:46.666
to be caught,
Veronica.

17:46.699 --> 17:49.136
I'm sorry, is it Veronica
or Veronique?

17:49.136 --> 17:50.503
Veronique.

17:50.537 --> 17:51.771
I thought so.

17:59.045 --> 18:00.380
What's going on with you?

18:00.413 --> 18:02.715
First, you turn down
my rear window,

18:02.749 --> 18:05.652
then you hide out in the closet
rearranging your ties.

18:05.685 --> 18:08.155
Babe...

18:08.155 --> 18:09.789
It's not you, it's me.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.327
[exhales sharply]

18:14.361 --> 18:16.763
[sighs]

18:16.796 --> 18:19.399
What happened
to your pubes?

18:19.432 --> 18:21.934
Were you standing in front
of the microwave for too long?

18:21.968 --> 18:27.407
I was pressured into a back,
sack, and crack wax at work.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.709
Too embarrassed to even look
at my own schwantz,

18:29.742 --> 18:30.843
let alone show you.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.245
What?

18:32.279 --> 18:33.746
Yeah.

18:33.780 --> 18:36.649
Yeah, everybody at Hercules
gets them.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.585
Picture that for a second.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.187
Do I have to?

18:40.220 --> 18:42.322
It's supposed to make it look
bigger, but I don't know.

18:42.355 --> 18:44.491
What do you think?

18:44.524 --> 18:47.260
I think you need
to exfoliate.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.729
[text alert]

18:49.762 --> 18:51.198
Oh, my God,
Brooke again.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.666
"We need to talk"?

18:53.700 --> 18:56.035
I know what's coming.
She's dumping me.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.737
I must have pissed her off
somehow.

18:57.770 --> 19:01.241
I'm terrified but excited
at the same time.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.775
If you want to dial back
the friendship,

19:02.809 --> 19:04.043
why don't you
just tell her?

19:04.076 --> 19:07.247
You mean be honest with Brooke
about how I feel?

19:07.280 --> 19:10.217
Are you trying to get me killed,
Andy? Christ!

19:10.217 --> 19:12.084
For the record,
she's the reason

19:12.118 --> 19:14.787
I even offered you
French third base.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.256
Who calls it that?

19:16.289 --> 19:17.557
No one you know.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.530
So, I've been doing
a lot of thinking.

19:23.563 --> 19:26.733
Langley has a hard road
ahead of her,

19:26.766 --> 19:30.237
with her face and hair,

19:30.270 --> 19:33.240
and I have a bad feeling
about her teeth.

19:33.240 --> 19:38.144
She needs someone to offer her
extra guidance and support,

19:38.245 --> 19:43.250
someone who understands
what it's like to be imperfect.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.418
Okay.
And?

19:45.452 --> 19:50.056
And you never make me feel bad,
and you were so helpful

19:50.089 --> 19:52.925
during my little bout
with post partum.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.962
Thank God that's over.
[laughs]

19:58.265 --> 20:02.469
Anyway, I'm hoping that
you'll be Langley's godmother

20:02.502 --> 20:06.273
even though technically,
you believe in the wrong god.

20:06.306 --> 20:09.442
Of course.
I'm legitimately honored.

20:09.476 --> 20:12.812
You're not just family anymore,
you're one of my friends.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.748
Also, I have good news.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.618
I ran it by the committee,
and you are

20:18.651 --> 20:22.088
going to vice-chair
my Nacho Gala.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.690
I'm sorry, what?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.892
New Yorkers Against
Childhood Obesity,

20:25.925 --> 20:27.260
the charity that I founded.

20:27.294 --> 20:29.228
Yeah, I--thank you,
but--

20:29.262 --> 20:31.331
Welcome to the head table.

20:31.364 --> 20:33.800
Oh.
Oh.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.769
[sobs quietly]

20:36.803 --> 20:38.371
[sobs loudly]

20:38.405 --> 20:40.473
- I don't know what to do!
- Totally normal.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.208
It's waves.
It comes in waves.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.110
- Oh!
- It's okay.

20:48.848 --> 20:51.884
Ready?
Are we doing this?

20:51.918 --> 20:54.086
I kind of feel like
you're cheating on my vag

20:54.120 --> 20:56.889
with my poop chute.
Can we have a safe word?

20:56.923 --> 20:59.158
Yeah.
Let's just--

20:59.191 --> 21:01.461
- Mmm, let's just try to relax.
- Okay.

21:01.494 --> 21:05.164
Okay, the safe word
is "thermos."

21:05.197 --> 21:08.200
- Okay. Fine.
- Okay.

21:10.637 --> 21:11.604
[sighs]
Ow!

21:11.638 --> 21:12.939
