JUST LIKE MY LOVE FOR YOU.

08:46.926 --> 08:49.161
- UH, YEAH, GEE,
TOO BAD I'M MILES AWAY

08:49.228 --> 08:50.496
AND YOU'LL NEVER FIND ME.

08:50.563 --> 08:52.164
- FOUND YOU!

08:52.231 --> 08:54.000
NOW HOW ABOUT A KISS,
LOVER BOY?

08:54.066 --> 08:56.369
MUAH!

08:56.435 --> 08:57.403
- AH!

08:57.470 --> 09:00.039
[thudding]

09:00.106 --> 09:02.174
UH.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.810
- WATCH OUT FOR THE BRICK WALL
I BUILT TO SURROUND OUR LOVE.

09:04.877 --> 09:07.747
- [sighs]

09:07.813 --> 09:10.716
[beeping]

09:10.783 --> 09:12.518
UH.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.320
WHERE AM I?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.122
- YOU'RE IN THE HOSPITAL,
YOUNG MAN.

09:16.188 --> 09:17.823
YOU RAN INTO A BRICK WALL
OVER AND OVER

09:17.890 --> 09:19.225
AND HAVE BEEN
UNCONSCIOUS FOR AN HOUR.

09:19.292 --> 09:21.060
- AN HOUR?
SWEET!

09:21.127 --> 09:22.595
THAT MEANS I ONLY HAVE
HALF AN HOUR TO GO.

09:22.662 --> 09:24.530
- LUCKY FOR YOU,
THIS YOUNG GIRL

09:24.597 --> 09:25.598
HAS BEEN PASSIONATELY
GIVING YOU MOUTH-TO-MOUTH

09:25.665 --> 09:27.733
THIS WHOLE TIME.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.468
- I'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU
TO PASS OUT AGAIN, LOVER BOY.

09:29.535 --> 09:31.037
- AH!

09:31.103 --> 09:32.738
[breathing heavily]

09:32.805 --> 09:34.607
THANK GOODNESS
THIS HOSPITAL IS SO BIG.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.575
I THINK I LOST TOOTIE
IN THE OPERATING ROOM.

09:36.642 --> 09:39.512
- I WANT A TIMMY-CHANGA.

09:39.578 --> 09:42.682
- AND I WANT A PLATE OF TIM-SUM.

09:42.748 --> 09:43.950
- VERY CLEVER.

09:44.016 --> 09:45.885
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, GUYS?

09:45.952 --> 09:48.554
I'VE DECIDED NOT TO BE
SCARED OF YOU ANYMORE.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.323
NEVER MIND!

09:50.389 --> 09:52.258
YOU GUYS ARE
EVEN SCARIER FAIRIES NOW.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.694
- DID I HEAR
SOMEONE MENTION FAIRIES?

09:54.760 --> 09:56.329
- MR. CROCKER?

09:56.395 --> 09:57.663
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
IN THE HOSPITAL?

09:57.730 --> 09:59.398
- I HAD TO GET THOSE TIGERS

09:59.465 --> 10:00.833
SURGICALLY REMOVED
FROM MY UNDERWEAR.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.635
I DON'T KNOW WHICH WAS WORSE,

10:02.702 --> 10:04.036
THE TIGER ATTACK
OR THE PASSIONATE MOUTH-TO-MOUTH

10:04.103 --> 10:05.905
FROM MOTHER.

10:05.972 --> 10:07.273
ANYHOO, I'LL TAKE A FAIRY NOW.
THANK YOU.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.942
- [growls loudly]

10:10.009 --> 10:12.211
- UH.
UH.

10:12.278 --> 10:15.614
UH, WOW, THEY'RE
MORE FEROCIOUS THAN I REMEMBER.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.450
MOTHER,
START THE CROCKER COPTER

10:17.516 --> 10:20.219
WHILE I DRAG MY LACERATED BODY
TOWARDS YOU.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.889
- BEATING UP MR. CROCKER
SURE WORKED UP AN APPETITE.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.193
- YEAH, I WANT A BLT SANDWICH.

10:27.259 --> 10:29.628
THAT'S BACON, LETTUCE,
AND TIM-MATO.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.330
- YAH!

10:31.397 --> 10:32.531
UH!

10:32.598 --> 10:34.467
- THERE YOU ARE, TIMMY.

10:34.533 --> 10:36.669
I BROUGHT A CANOE PADDLE
TO HELP YOU PASS OUT AGAIN.

10:36.736 --> 10:38.037
- AH!

10:38.104 --> 10:41.407
- [moaning]

10:41.474 --> 10:43.676
- UH!

10:43.743 --> 10:44.844
UH!

10:44.910 --> 10:47.880
[tigers growling]

10:47.947 --> 10:49.181
YAH!

10:49.248 --> 10:51.550
[all laughing maniacally]

10:51.617 --> 10:53.619
[Timmy breathing heavily]

10:53.686 --> 10:55.221
UH.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.123
OH, NO.
I THINK I'M ON THE ROOF.

10:57.189 --> 10:58.491
THAT MEANS I'M TRAPPED.

10:58.557 --> 11:00.092
[loud crash]

11:00.159 --> 11:02.528
[loud pounding]

11:02.595 --> 11:05.264
WAIT, ONLY 30 SECONDS LEFT
UNTIL THE LIGHTS COME ON.

11:05.331 --> 11:06.132
I CAN DO THIS.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.703
OH, NO.
MAYBE I CAN'T.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.343
FIVE SECONDS.

11:17.410 --> 11:21.647
FOUR, THREE, TWO.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.816
AH!

11:23.883 --> 11:24.884
NO!

11:24.950 --> 11:26.986
STOP EATING ME!

11:27.053 --> 11:29.555
AH!

11:29.622 --> 11:31.690
WAIT, THE WISH IS OVER?

11:31.757 --> 11:33.726
THE LIGHT'S BACK ON,
AND I'M NOT IN COSMO'S STOMACH?

11:33.793 --> 11:36.462
- YEP, WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL,
AND JUST IN TIME TOO.

11:36.529 --> 11:38.531
YOU WERE PRETTY SCARED, SPORT.

11:38.597 --> 11:41.600
- NO, I WASN'T.

11:41.667 --> 11:42.835
AH!
YES, I WAS.

11:42.902 --> 11:44.036
I WAS SCARED.

11:44.103 --> 11:45.538
TURN THE LIGHTS ON.

11:45.604 --> 11:47.106
- [laughs]

11:47.173 --> 11:48.941
BOY, WE REALLY
GOT YOU, TIMMY.

11:49.008 --> 11:52.311
I MEAN, UM...

11:52.378 --> 11:53.712
WANDA BROKE
YOUR FLOWER POT.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.681
- WAIT A MINUTE.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.550
YOU GUYS WERE ONLY PRETENDING
TO BE SCARY FAIRIES?

11:57.616 --> 11:59.485
- YEP.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.253
YOU NEEDED TO LEARN YOUR LESSON
ABOUT SCARING POOF.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.622
- POOF, I'M REALLY SORRY
I SCARED YOU

12:03.689 --> 12:05.558
AND THAT I MADE
SUCH A SILLY WISH.

12:05.624 --> 12:07.726
I DON'T EVER WANT
THAT MUCH DARKNESS AGAIN.

12:07.793 --> 12:08.994
AND WHILE
THERE'S STILL DAYLIGHT,

12:09.061 --> 12:10.529
I'M GONNA ENJOY IT.

12:10.596 --> 12:12.198
AH!
thud!

12:12.264 --> 12:14.300
- THE HOUSE
IS STILL ON A HILL, SON.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.035
- YAY!
TIMMY'S UNCONSCIOUS AGAIN!

12:36.255 --> 12:37.990
- HEY, TURNER FAMILY,

12:38.057 --> 12:40.526
THIS IS GONNA BE
THE GREATEST VACATION EVER,

12:40.593 --> 12:43.062
ONE WHOLE WEEK AT THE GOLDEN
CARCASS LUXURY MOTEL

12:43.129 --> 12:44.430
IN TUCSON, ARIZONA!

12:44.497 --> 12:45.831
- UH.

12:45.898 --> 12:47.233
- AW, WHAT'S WRONG, SPORT?

12:47.299 --> 12:49.101
YOU DON'T SEEM TOO EXCITED.

12:49.168 --> 12:50.870
- IT'S JUST THAT MY DAD
GETS LOST ON THE WAY

12:50.936 --> 12:54.640
TO EVERY VACATION.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.575
DAD, I DON'T THINK
WE'RE IN THE DESERT.

12:56.642 --> 12:58.777
- YEE, WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT,
TIMMY?

12:58.844 --> 13:01.580
- WE JUST PASSED
SANTA'S WORKSHOP.

13:01.647 --> 13:03.916
- MERRY CHRISTMAS!

13:03.983 --> 13:05.684
[all gasp]

13:05.751 --> 13:07.186
[all screaming]

13:09.989 --> 13:11.157
- TIMMY'S RIGHT.

13:11.223 --> 13:12.391
WE'RE LOST.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.493
- OH, NONSENSE, HONEY.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.929
MEN HAVE GPSses
FOR BRAINS.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.764
WE NEVER GO THE WRONG WAY.

13:18.831 --> 13:19.798
[all screaming]

13:22.735 --> 13:24.537
all: WRONG WAY!

13:24.603 --> 13:28.874
[all screaming]

13:28.941 --> 13:31.277
- [whimpering]

13:31.343 --> 13:33.345
ANOTHER ELF
ON THE WINDSHIELD

13:33.412 --> 13:36.282
AND ANOTHER VACATION
GONE HORRIBLY WRONG,

13:36.348 --> 13:38.484
JUST LIKE OUR TRIP
TO MOUNT ST. DIMMSDALE...

13:42.388 --> 13:43.422
[all screaming]

13:45.357 --> 13:46.959
AND OUR TRIP
TO THE BIG APPLE...

13:51.163 --> 13:51.697
[all screaming]

13:54.166 --> 13:56.936
AND OUR TRIP
TO DRAGON COUNTRY SAFARI.

14:02.875 --> 14:03.709
[all screaming]

14:05.544 --> 14:06.912
NO!

14:06.979 --> 14:08.914
I CAN'T RUIN ANOTHER VACATION.

14:08.981 --> 14:10.916
I KNOW.

14:10.983 --> 14:12.751
I'LL BUILD A BOAT
AND SAIL MY FAMILY TO SAFETY,

14:12.818 --> 14:14.987
AND I WON'T
FEEL LIKE A MAN TILL I DO.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.656
I'LL JUST FEEL LIKE
A WOMAN NAMED LINDA.

14:20.259 --> 14:22.995
- AND I'LL DO WHAT I ALWAYS DO
ON THESE VACATIONS:

14:23.062 --> 14:27.299
LIGHT A SIGNAL FIRE
AND GATHER COCONUTS.

14:27.366 --> 14:29.568
- I FEEL BAD
FOR YOUR FATHER, SPORT.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.937
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST
POOF US ALL BACK HOME.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.939
- NOPE, YOU HEARD MY DAD.

14:34.006 --> 14:36.609
HE'S NOT GONNA FEEL BETTER
UNLESS HE SAVES US.

14:36.675 --> 14:38.410
BESIDES, HE AND THE ELF
ARE HANDLING THINGS JUST FINE.

14:40.779 --> 14:42.414
- GEH!
GEH.

14:42.481 --> 14:44.250
LINDA BROKE HER FINGERNAIL.

14:44.316 --> 14:46.919
- ANYWAY, WHILE MY DAD
WORKS ON SAVING US,

14:46.986 --> 14:48.454
I'M GONNA ENJOY
AN ACTUAL VACATION.

14:50.889 --> 14:52.625
AH, THIS IS THE LIFE,

14:52.691 --> 14:53.993
KICKING BACK ON THE BEACH
WITH NO SCHOOL

14:54.059 --> 14:55.527
AND NO MR. CROCKER.

14:55.594 --> 14:56.962
[slurping]

14:57.029 --> 14:58.197
I WONDER WHAT HE'S DOING NOW.

14:58.264 --> 14:59.898
- "F!"

14:59.965 --> 15:01.533
HMM.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.735
IT JUST DOESN'T
FEEL THE SAME.

15:02.801 --> 15:06.372
HERE, PUT THESE ON.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.274
"F!"

15:08.340 --> 15:10.376
UH, STILL NO GOOD.

15:10.442 --> 15:14.213
WITHOUT TURNER TO HUMILIATE,
MY LIFE HAS LOST ALL MEANING.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.882
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE A MAN ANYMORE.

15:16.949 --> 15:19.451
I FEEL LIKE
A WOMAN NAMED LINDA.

15:22.321 --> 15:23.956
AH!
LINDA BROKE HER FINGERNAIL.

15:25.958 --> 15:29.495
- TIMMY, I STOLE THESE BERRIES
FROM AN ANGRY MONKEY.

15:29.561 --> 15:31.897
WOULD YOU TRY THEM
TO SEE IF THEY'RE POISONOUS?

15:31.964 --> 15:33.999
- NO NEED
FOR POISONOUS BERRIES, MOM.

15:34.066 --> 15:36.268
- WOW, WHERE
DID YOU GET A SMOOTHIE,

15:36.335 --> 15:38.804
CLUB SANDWICH,
AND CURLY FRIES?

15:38.871 --> 15:40.639
- UH, I SNARED THEM
IN A NET.

15:40.706 --> 15:43.676
- OH, YOU'RE QUITE
THE LITTLE SURVIVOR.

15:43.742 --> 15:45.778
HM, UNLIKE YOUR FATHER, LINDA.

15:45.844 --> 15:47.579
- LINDA HEARD THAT.

15:47.646 --> 15:48.847
- DAD, I BROUGHT YOU
A SANDWICH AND A DRINK.

15:48.914 --> 15:49.948
WHOA!

15:50.015 --> 15:52.418
WHAT IS THIS?

15:52.484 --> 15:54.453
- EEH, IT'S A BOAT STORE.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.955
EVERYONE KNOWS YOU CAN'T
GET A BOAT WITHOUT A BOAT STORE.

15:57.022 --> 15:59.491
- UH, WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER
TO JUST BUILD A BOAT?

15:59.558 --> 16:01.427
- SURE, TIMMY.

16:01.493 --> 16:04.263
AND IT WOULD BE EASIER TO COUNT
TO 7 IF 7 CAME BEFORE 5.

16:04.330 --> 16:06.265
BUT LIFE
DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY.

16:06.332 --> 16:08.467
- OKAY.

16:08.534 --> 16:10.269
LOOK, I THINK YOU'VE BEEN OUT
IN THE SUN A LITTLE TOO LONG.

16:10.336 --> 16:11.470
WHY DON'T YOU
PUT ON SOME SUN BLOCK?

16:11.537 --> 16:13.072
- DEH, NO NEED, SON.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.173
I'M WEARING A HAT.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.745
- UH.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.514
- TIMMY, I THINK YOUR DAD'S
GONE A LITTLE CRAZY.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.750
SHOULDN'T WE POOF BACK
TO DIMMSDALE NOW?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.685
- NO, IF MY DAD
DOESN'T SAVE US ON HIS OWN,

16:26.752 --> 16:28.354
WE'LL HAVE
TO CALL HIM "LINDA" FOREVER,

16:28.420 --> 16:29.988
AND HE'LL FEEL
TOTALLY USELESS.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.057
- I FEEL TOTALLY USELESS.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.360
OH, LINDA,
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO.

16:34.426 --> 16:36.395
WITHOUT TURNER TO DESTROY,

16:36.462 --> 16:38.030
YOU'VE BECOME
A SHELL OF A WOMAN.

16:38.097 --> 16:40.132
[low rumbling]

16:40.199 --> 16:41.934
- CLEAR THE AREA.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.102
THIS BUILDING
IS ABOUT TO BE DEMOLISHED.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.403
- THAT'S IT.

16:44.470 --> 16:46.305
CAN'T DESTROY TURNER,

16:46.372 --> 16:47.840
BUT MAYBE WATCHING
SOMETHING ELSE GET DESTROYED

16:47.906 --> 16:50.976
WILL CHEER ME UP.

16:51.043 --> 16:52.378
crash!

16:52.444 --> 16:53.445
NOTHING.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.947
I FEEL NOTHING.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.215
UH!
OKAY, I FELT THAT.

16:58.250 --> 17:00.486
- THANKS FOR THE WATERSLIDE,
GUYS.

17:00.552 --> 17:01.186
WHOO-HOO!

17:04.790 --> 17:06.724
NOW HOW ABOUT POOFING ME UP
A FROZEN YOGURT STAND?

17:10.095 --> 17:11.363
OH, YEAH.

17:11.430 --> 17:13.265
all: UH-LUH-LUH-LUH-LUH-LUH.

17:13.332 --> 17:16.602
- OH, LOOK, A WATERSLIDE
AND A FROZEN YOGURT STAND.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.704
I WONDER
WHERE THOSE CAME FROM.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.005
- UH, GLOBAL WARMING?

17:20.071 --> 17:22.407
- WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

17:22.473 --> 17:24.276
- AND I'D BETTER
CHECK ON POOF.

17:24.343 --> 17:27.146
I PROMISED I'D HELP HIM
BUILD A SANDCASTLE.

17:27.212 --> 17:30.182
- POOF-POOF?

17:30.249 --> 17:33.018
- WELL, IT'S A START, POOF,
BUT YOU TOTALLY FORGOT THE MOAT.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.290
clang!

17:43.195 --> 17:44.863
- POOF-POOF?

17:44.930 --> 17:46.965
- TIMMY, OH,
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME

17:47.032 --> 17:49.401
FOR THE GRAND OPENING
OF LINDA'S BOAT STORE.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.606
- WHOA.

17:54.673 --> 17:55.707
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS TAKE ONE OF THESE BOATS

17:55.774 --> 17:57.443
AND SAIL HOME.

17:57.509 --> 17:58.811
- TIMMY,
WE CAN'T JUST TAKE A BOAT.

17:58.877 --> 18:00.579
THAT WOULD BE STEALING.

18:00.646 --> 18:01.980
WE HAVE TO BUY ONE
FROM THE BOAT SALESMAN.

18:02.047 --> 18:04.082
BUT I HAVEN'T BUILT HIM YET.

18:04.149 --> 18:05.417
- WHERE'D YOU GET
THE POWER SAW?

18:05.484 --> 18:07.085
- I BORROWED IT FROM STANLEY

18:07.152 --> 18:08.787
OVER AT
THE HARDWARE STORE I BUILT.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.656
IT'S RIGHT NEXT
TO THE LAUNDROMAT.

18:10.722 --> 18:12.558
HI, STANLEY.

18:12.624 --> 18:13.826
I SEE YOU'RE OUT
FOR A STROLL WITH THE MISSUS.

18:18.397 --> 18:20.032
- WANDA WAS RIGHT.

18:20.098 --> 18:20.699
WE NEED TO GET MY DAD
OUT OF HERE.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.470
- WHAT DID YOU FIND, POOF?

18:24.536 --> 18:26.138
- POOF-POOF?

18:26.205 --> 18:27.706
- WOW!
JUST WHAT I ALWAYS WANTED,

18:27.773 --> 18:29.041
A BOMB-SHAPED
ALARM CLOCK.

18:29.107 --> 18:30.008
WHAT'S THIS BUTTON DO?

18:30.075 --> 18:30.576
beep!

18:41.086 --> 18:42.821
AW, I WAS HOPING
IT WAS THE RADIO.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.456
STUPID ALARM CLOCK.

18:44.523 --> 18:45.757
LET'S HIT IT
WITH A HAMMER.

18:45.824 --> 18:48.193
- [laughing]

18:50.996 --> 18:53.532
[buzzing]

18:53.599 --> 18:56.602
- UH, GENERAL MCCLOUD,
REMEMBER THAT BOMB WE LOST?

18:56.668 --> 18:58.070
- WHICH ONE,
SERGEANT FLINT?

18:58.136 --> 18:59.705
WE'RE THE U.S. MILITARY!

18:59.771 --> 19:01.840
WE LOSE BOMBS EVERY DAY!

19:01.907 --> 19:04.243
- UH, IT'S THE ONE THAT
LOOKS LIKE A BIG ALARM CLOCK.

19:04.309 --> 19:05.811
WELL, IT'S BEEN ACTIVATED.

19:05.878 --> 19:07.145
- FANTASTIC.

19:07.212 --> 19:08.847
A DEPRESSED FIFTH-GRADE TEACHER

19:08.914 --> 19:10.849
HAS BROUGHT HIS CLASS
ON A FIELD TRIP.

19:10.916 --> 19:12.818
THEY'RE GONNA LOVE
WATCHING AN ISLAND EXPLODE.

19:12.885 --> 19:14.853
- IS THE ISLAND NAMED TIMMY?

19:14.920 --> 19:15.454
- WHOO-HOO!

19:18.123 --> 19:19.658
WANDA?
WHAT'S THAT HUMMING SOUND?

19:23.195 --> 19:23.729
UH.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.599
- HEY, GUYS.

19:27.666 --> 19:30.135
MAN, ARE YOU HAVING
A BAD HAIR DAY.

19:30.202 --> 19:33.005
- COSMO,
WHAT IS THAT THING?

19:33.071 --> 19:34.306
- OH, THIS?

19:34.373 --> 19:35.541
JUST A STUPID ALARM CLOCK.

19:35.607 --> 19:36.675
WANT TO KNOW THE TIME?

19:36.742 --> 19:37.910
IT'S 10:29.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.278
10:28.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.712
10:27.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.514
- COSMO, THAT'S A BOMB.

19:42.581 --> 19:44.283
- A BOMB?

19:44.349 --> 19:45.517
YOU GUYS GOT TO POOF
ME AND MY PARENTS

19:45.584 --> 19:46.685
OUT OF HERE RIGHT NOW.

19:46.752 --> 19:50.188
[trumpet fanfare]

19:50.255 --> 19:52.157
- [grunting]

19:52.224 --> 19:54.393
- OH, THAT BOMB'S
PUTTING OUT A MAGNETIC FIELD

19:54.459 --> 19:56.361
THAT'S AFFECTING OUR MAGIC.

19:56.428 --> 19:58.130
- OH, NO.

19:58.196 --> 20:00.065
NOW THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SAVE US
IS MY DAD.

20:00.132 --> 20:01.066
[all screaming]

20:03.535 --> 20:05.604
DAD, WE'VE GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE FAST.

20:05.671 --> 20:07.205
THERE'S A BOMB ON THE ISLAND.

20:07.272 --> 20:09.007
- NO PROBLEM, TIMMY.

20:09.074 --> 20:11.009
I JUST BOUGHT A BOAT
FROM EDUARDO HERE.

20:11.076 --> 20:13.278
EDUARDO, YOU'VE GOT
YOURSELF A DEAL.

20:23.522 --> 20:24.656
- OH, NO.

20:24.723 --> 20:25.924
THIS IS A DISASTER.

20:25.991 --> 20:27.192
- YOU'RE TELLING ME.

20:27.259 --> 20:28.994
EDUARDO'S HURT BAD.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.195
IT'S A GOOD THING
I BUILT A HOSPITAL

20:30.262 --> 20:31.563
NEXT TO THE AIRPORT.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.165
WE COULD TAKE THAT PLANE HOME,

20:33.231 --> 20:34.866
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW TO FLY.

20:34.933 --> 20:36.401
I'M GONNA GO BUILD
A FLIGHT SCHOOL.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.136
- AH!
DAD, LISTEN TO ME!

20:38.203 --> 20:39.371
YOU WANTED TO SAVE OUR FAMILY,
RIGHT?

20:39.438 --> 20:41.306
THIS IS YOUR BIG CHANCE.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.875
- WELL, WE COULD ALWAYS USE
THE SUBMARINE, I GUESS.

20:43.942 --> 20:44.576
[chirps]

20:47.813 --> 20:49.381
[dolphins chirping]

20:49.448 --> 20:51.650
WITH ALL THE SPARE TIME I HAD,

20:51.717 --> 20:54.286
I CONVERTED THE STATION WAGON
INTO AN AMPHIBIOUS VEHICLE.

20:54.353 --> 20:55.621
- THAT'S AWESOME.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.556
I'LL GET MOM.

20:57.623 --> 20:58.757
- AND I'LL GET STANLEY
AND HIS HEADLESS WIFE.

20:58.824 --> 21:01.360
[beeping]

21:03.962 --> 21:05.430
- WELCOME TO THE TOUR!

21:05.497 --> 21:07.099
IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

21:07.165 --> 21:10.636
YOU GET
TO WATCH AN ISLAND BLOW UP.

21:10.702 --> 21:13.505
HAVE A COMPLIMENTARY JUICE BOX.

21:13.572 --> 21:15.007
[beeping]

21:15.073 --> 21:16.875
- [breathing heavily]

21:16.942 --> 21:20.178
- GENERAL MCCLOUD,
THE ISLAND'S INHABITED.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.014
- IT'S TURNER.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.383
HE'S ABOUT
TO BE DESTROYED FOR REAL.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.918
SUDDENLY I FEEL ALIVE AGAIN.

21:26.985 --> 21:29.187
- WE CAN'T BLOW UP
A POPULATED ISLAND, LINDA.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.056
BESIDES,
THERE'S AN ELF ON IT.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.058
WE'LL ALL END UP
ON SANTA'S NAUGHTY LIST.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.993
DEACTIVATE THAT BOMB, SERGEANT!

21:37.496 --> 21:40.632
- NO!

21:40.699 --> 21:42.968
[electrical sizzling]

21:43.035 --> 21:45.103
- SAY, THE CIRCUITS ARE FRIED.

21:45.170 --> 21:47.239
I CAN'T STOP THE BOMB
FROM DETONATING.

21:47.305 --> 21:48.340
- HOORAY!

21:48.407 --> 21:50.275
I MEAN, OOPS.

21:50.342 --> 21:51.176
CAN YOU ZOOM IN ON THE KID
WITH THE BEAVER TEETH?

21:55.514 --> 21:57.416
- HANG ON, EVERYONE.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.084
I'LL SAVE YOU
OR MY NAME ISN'T LINDA.

22:02.320 --> 22:04.189
- HURRY!

22:04.256 --> 22:07.159
WHO KNOWS HOW MUCH TIME WE HAVE
TILL THAT BOMB EXPLODES.

22:07.225 --> 22:08.694
- I KNOW.
WE HAVE FIVE,

22:08.760 --> 22:10.562
FOUR, THREE...

22:10.629 --> 22:12.164
- COSMO,
GET RID OF THAT BOMB!

22:19.237 --> 22:21.106
[beeping]

22:22.741 --> 22:24.443
[explosion]

22:26.912 --> 22:28.547
[all crying]

22:28.613 --> 22:29.614
- HOORAY!

22:29.681 --> 22:31.183
BEST TOUR EVER!

22:31.249 --> 22:33.085
- [whimpering]

22:35.387 --> 22:37.122
GOOD NEWS, KIDS.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.690
EVERYONE ON THE ISLAND
MADE IT TO SAFETY.

22:38.757 --> 22:39.891
- EH?

22:39.958 --> 22:41.059
[children cheering]

22:41.126 --> 22:42.961
NO!

22:43.028 --> 22:44.730
MOTHER, MY MOTHER.

22:44.796 --> 22:46.531
- NOW, NOW, LINDA.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.166
A PRETTY LADY LIKE YOU
SHOULDN'T CRY.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.902
[all cheering]

22:50.969 --> 22:52.204
- YOU DID IT, LINDA.

22:52.270 --> 22:53.371
I MEAN DAD.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.173
- YOU'RE A HERO.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.808
- THAT WAS
THE BEST VACATION EVER.

22:59.177 --> 23:02.447
- HONEY, I THINK YOU'RE
GOING THE WRONG WAY AGAIN.

23:02.514 --> 23:03.248
- AM NOT.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.318
[all screaming]

23:08.453 --> 23:12.224
OOH, WE ARE SO GOING TO BE
ON SANTA'S NAUGHTY LIST.

23:12.290 --> 23:14.226
- WRONG WAY!
- WRONG WAY!

23:14.292 --> 23:15.327
[all screaming]

23:15.393 --> 23:17.062
- HO, HO, HO!

23:18.864 --> 23:19.498
- LINDA!
