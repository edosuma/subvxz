WEBVTT

00:04.800 --> 00:07.778
When you said we had
reservations, David...

00:07.802 --> 00:11.357
I was picturing something
a little more... upscale?

00:11.678 --> 00:13.091
You don't recognize it?

00:13.115 --> 00:14.115
Should I?

00:14.491 --> 00:15.491
Think back.

00:20.366 --> 00:22.436
I cannot believe you forgot.

00:22.679 --> 00:23.960
Oh, my God.

00:23.995 --> 00:25.215
This is where your grandmother

00:25.257 --> 00:26.967
choked to death on veal.

00:26.991 --> 00:27.991
No.

00:28.491 --> 00:29.971
Okay, picture this...

00:30.427 --> 00:32.972
A small water fountain right there.

00:33.243 --> 00:34.243
We sat...

00:34.492 --> 00:35.492
right here.

00:37.617 --> 00:38.740
You do remember.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.850
That we met here?

00:41.367 --> 00:42.487
Oh, I remember.

00:42.680 --> 00:45.469
I also remember it was
over ten years ago, David.

00:45.493 --> 00:48.282
Yeah, I guess that's kind
of a long time to date.

00:48.306 --> 00:50.100
Four's long. 12?

00:50.166 --> 00:51.876
Pathetic, I know.

00:52.306 --> 00:55.117
I should have done this
a long time ago, so...

00:58.743 --> 01:00.343
Mary Elizabeth Donahue,

01:01.745 --> 01:02.745
will you...

01:05.967 --> 01:07.504
You can do it, baby.

01:08.369 --> 01:10.434
It's only four simple words.

02:10.376 --> 02:12.852
Every knife has its
own individual balance.

02:12.876 --> 02:14.041
The trick is to find it.

02:14.065 --> 02:15.125
When you do...

02:17.191 --> 02:18.191
you get this.

02:18.752 --> 02:19.946
Any questions?

02:20.502 --> 02:22.167
Gibbs really approved this?

02:22.191 --> 02:24.605
Yes, McGee. Why do you
keep on asking that?

02:24.629 --> 02:27.169
Well, because they give
us Sigs for a reason.

02:27.193 --> 02:28.794
In Mossad, we have a saying:

02:28.818 --> 02:30.293
Knives don't run out of bullets.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.854
Now any questions pertaining
this particular class?

02:32.878 --> 02:34.703
Yeah, I got one for you.

02:34.943 --> 02:37.483
You ever kill anyone with a spoon?

02:39.692 --> 02:42.791
No, but I'm seriously considering it.

02:43.318 --> 02:45.328
All right, grab your knives.

02:45.444 --> 02:48.419
So, you come right past your ear.

02:48.473 --> 02:51.634
Once your arm is fully
extended, you release.

02:53.632 --> 02:54.632
Tony!

02:57.070 --> 02:59.970
All right. Watch and
learn, probie-sans.

03:06.944 --> 03:09.422
Five summers at
Camp Poke-a-quatic.

03:09.446 --> 03:11.674
I was also a pretty mean clogger.

03:12.946 --> 03:14.920
That doesn't leave this room.

03:14.944 --> 03:16.613
Nobody cares if you spent your summers

03:16.637 --> 03:19.357
prancing about in little wooden shoes.

03:19.381 --> 03:20.976
The term is "dancing."

03:21.945 --> 03:22.945
McGee...

03:26.384 --> 03:27.384
Math camp?

03:28.509 --> 03:29.509
Chess.

03:30.132 --> 03:31.986
But at least I didn't wear man-clogs.

03:33.883 --> 03:34.883
Lee.

03:35.501 --> 03:38.718
Okay... right by my ear.

03:44.383 --> 03:46.985
I thought you said you
grew up around weapons?

03:47.009 --> 03:49.674
I did. I didn't say
my father actually let

03:49.698 --> 03:50.924
me touch any of them.

03:50.948 --> 03:51.948
Okay.

03:52.324 --> 03:54.004
- It's my fault, Gibbs. I was...
- Save it.

03:54.884 --> 03:57.220
We've got a dead sailor in
Georgetown. Grab your gear.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.010
Thank you.

04:07.200 --> 04:08.435
Pulled his I.D.

04:08.825 --> 04:11.112
Found our victim was
a sailor. Called you.

04:11.136 --> 04:12.926
A couple found him here last night.

04:12.950 --> 04:15.300
Supposedly this was where
they had their first date.

04:15.324 --> 04:18.067
Guy got the keys from the
landlord, wanted to propose.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.683
Well, nothing says "I love you,"

04:19.742 --> 04:22.694
like a rotting corpse in
an abandoned crap hole.

04:22.718 --> 04:23.909
What did she say?

04:23.933 --> 04:24.933
She, um...

04:24.968 --> 04:27.444
says she wants this back
before he changes his mind.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.468
Yeesh.

04:28.718 --> 04:30.694
And they say romance is dead.

04:30.718 --> 04:32.507
Wallet was next to his body.

04:32.531 --> 04:33.819
No money, no credit cards.

04:33.843 --> 04:36.196
Just a military I. D.
And driver's license.

04:36.220 --> 04:37.220
Robbed.

04:37.278 --> 04:39.069
I'd be curious to know
how he died, Agent Gibbs.

04:39.093 --> 04:41.206
When I know, Detective Morris,

04:42.168 --> 04:43.242
you will know.

04:43.277 --> 04:44.399
I appreciate it.

04:45.654 --> 04:47.756
Got the statements we took
from the couple in my car.

04:47.780 --> 04:48.758
All right.

04:48.782 --> 04:51.259
You're on sketch details there, Probie.

04:51.283 --> 04:53.344
I tell you, this thing
is making me nervous.

05:01.471 --> 05:04.322
The larval stage of the Musca domestica,

05:04.346 --> 05:07.316
the common housefly, a nuisance to most,

05:07.363 --> 05:10.132
but invaluable to the
trained investigator.

05:10.156 --> 05:12.574
Not to mention a great
source of protein.

05:12.598 --> 05:14.261
Saw it on the Discovery Channel.

05:14.285 --> 05:16.323
A documentary on survival training.

05:16.347 --> 05:17.877
Ah, as I was saying,

05:17.909 --> 05:20.511
they should prove helpful in
determining the time of death,

05:20.535 --> 05:24.680
unless, of course, my assistant
decides to eat them first.

05:24.785 --> 05:26.886
Temperature and current size, Doctor?

05:26.910 --> 05:28.355
These eggs couldn't have been laid

05:28.405 --> 05:29.546
in his mouth more than a week ago.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.708
Very good, Jethro.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.700
It's surprisingly warm in here.

05:33.747 --> 05:37.450
I'd estimate he's been
dead somewhere between...

05:37.474 --> 05:38.889
four and five days.

05:39.474 --> 05:40.474
Any idea how?

05:40.658 --> 05:44.055
Many, but with no obvious signs

05:44.096 --> 05:45.950
of trauma or injury,
that will have to wait

05:45.974 --> 05:47.323
until we get him home.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.827
Let's get the gurney, Mr. Palmer.

05:55.350 --> 05:57.710
McGee, what do you make of this?

05:58.160 --> 06:00.136
The word "disgusting" comes to mind.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.680
I think he was talking about the card.

06:03.442 --> 06:04.801
Maybe some kind of ticket?

06:05.975 --> 06:07.330
Find out for what.

06:08.350 --> 06:09.428
Ziva, photos.

06:09.476 --> 06:12.102
McGee, you find any more maggots
walking around, you bag them.

06:12.149 --> 06:13.407
They're evidence.

06:17.036 --> 06:20.341
Ziva, I will give you
$100 to trade with me.

06:20.789 --> 06:22.703
You're afraid of bugs, McGee?

06:22.727 --> 06:23.727
Bugs, no.

06:24.911 --> 06:26.414
Uh... wriggling, faceless

06:26.465 --> 06:29.125
blob creatures crawling
inside human flesh? Yes.

06:29.546 --> 06:32.263
Believe it or not, I
used to feel the same way.

06:32.287 --> 06:33.291
How'd you get over it?

06:33.349 --> 06:36.514
I found that... that
if you're hungry enough,

06:36.538 --> 06:38.720
they actually don't taste that bad.

06:40.791 --> 06:43.768
Our dead sailor is Petty
Officer Evan Davidson.

06:43.792 --> 06:46.390
A corpsman stationed at The
Basic School in Quantico.

06:46.414 --> 06:48.847
Reported UA four days ago.

06:48.882 --> 06:51.454
Last seen Thursday night
at a Georgetown bar.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.390
Marine buds said he
hooked up with a girl

06:53.414 --> 06:54.830
and left before closing.

06:54.854 --> 06:56.643
Marines ever leave before closing?

06:56.667 --> 06:58.706
I'm gonna head down to
Quantico, get her description.

06:58.730 --> 07:01.157
McGee, tell me about the
card we found on the body.

07:01.791 --> 07:02.791
Where is he?

07:04.042 --> 07:05.462
Apparently not here.

07:07.665 --> 07:08.780
I'll find him.

07:13.606 --> 07:15.436
Gibbs is looking for you.

07:17.760 --> 07:19.287
Ziva, this is a men's room.

07:19.338 --> 07:21.126
You can't be in here.

07:21.667 --> 07:24.142
He wants to know what you
found out the pink ticket.

07:24.166 --> 07:25.166
Hi.

07:26.545 --> 07:29.394
Trying to wash the bug germs off, yes?

07:29.457 --> 07:31.390
Will you please leave?

07:35.482 --> 07:36.895
He didn't wash his hands.

07:36.939 --> 07:38.696
You need to learn to
face your fears, McGee.

07:38.738 --> 07:39.860
I can help you with that.

07:39.924 --> 07:41.394
I do not need help, okay?

07:41.418 --> 07:43.209
I just don't like maggots.

07:43.233 --> 07:44.147
Why?

07:44.171 --> 07:47.569
Much like the concept of a
men's room, it's personal.

07:52.856 --> 07:56.769
Have you ever wondered why
perfectly healthy individuals

07:56.793 --> 07:58.513
suddenly and occasionally

07:58.919 --> 08:01.224
keel over and die, Mr. Palmer?

08:01.984 --> 08:03.249
Yeah, now that you mention it...

08:03.273 --> 08:04.455
No. No, no, no, no.

08:04.497 --> 08:06.086
It's a trick question.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.087
They don't.

08:07.111 --> 08:08.940
There is always a reason.

08:09.545 --> 08:11.646
Now, take our Petty
Officer, for example.

08:11.670 --> 08:13.524
On the outside, he appears young,

08:13.548 --> 08:17.131
virile, perfect physical
condition, yet inside...

08:17.221 --> 08:21.278
we find the liver
of a 75-year-old man.

08:21.486 --> 08:24.401
It is swollen, scarred
and well on its way

08:24.425 --> 08:26.472
to full-blown cirrhosis.

08:26.675 --> 08:27.772
He's an alcoholic?

08:27.796 --> 08:28.976
Was, Mr. Palmer.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.150
That what killed him, Duck?

08:31.174 --> 08:33.587
No, but it was certainly
a contributing factor.

08:33.611 --> 08:35.962
His blood-alcohol level was five times

08:35.986 --> 08:37.167
the legal limit.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.519
I'm surprised he could stand,

08:38.577 --> 08:41.023
never mind break into
an abandoned restaurant.

08:41.047 --> 08:43.177
And his preliminary tox screen

08:43.547 --> 08:46.675
also shows traces of
Ecstasy and other chemicals

08:46.716 --> 08:49.948
in his blood: Quite
a volatile cocktail.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.464
What kind of other chemicals?

08:51.488 --> 08:53.651
Abby's running them right now.

08:53.675 --> 08:55.660
It appears our young man went

08:55.709 --> 08:57.775
on a bender Thursday night,

08:57.799 --> 09:00.215
one from which he could not recover.

09:00.239 --> 09:01.239
He OD'd.

09:01.614 --> 09:04.090
That would explain the multiple
organ failures we found.

09:04.114 --> 09:06.840
We won't know more till
we finish the autopsy.

09:06.864 --> 09:08.519
Very good, Mr. Palmer.

09:09.114 --> 09:11.474
Anything else you'd care to add?

09:11.614 --> 09:13.466
Well, there's a very good chance

09:13.490 --> 09:15.967
that this was an
accidental death, Doctor.

09:15.991 --> 09:18.541
Nothing accidental about it, Palmer.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.029
People who choose to
live their lives this way

09:23.053 --> 09:25.658
have nobody to blame but themselves.

09:27.304 --> 09:29.468
I hereby accept your challenge.

09:29.492 --> 09:31.718
We'll meet on the field at dawn.

09:31.742 --> 09:32.530
Weapons,

09:32.554 --> 09:34.406
caffeine-fueled intellect versus

09:34.430 --> 09:36.745
cold silicate-based intelligence.

09:36.804 --> 09:37.804
Until then...

09:38.118 --> 09:40.118
I bid you a good day, sir.

09:41.492 --> 09:42.492
Hi.

09:42.733 --> 09:43.733
Hi.

09:43.805 --> 09:46.344
You talk to your mass spectrometer?

09:46.368 --> 09:47.493
Yeah. Sometimes.

09:48.676 --> 09:49.653
Why?

09:49.677 --> 09:51.094
You challenged it to a duel.

09:51.118 --> 09:54.018
Well, it spit out a chemical composition

09:54.115 --> 09:55.529
that I'm not familiar with.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.655
There has to be some sense
of decorum around here.

09:57.679 --> 09:59.154
I'm running it through the computer now.

09:59.178 --> 10:01.532
Now, Gibbs is more interested in this.

10:01.556 --> 10:02.655
Did you find anything yet?

10:02.679 --> 10:05.094
When, McGee? If you haven't noticed,

10:05.118 --> 10:06.823
I'm the only one here.

10:07.307 --> 10:09.780
Which may be why I started
talking to my machines

10:09.804 --> 10:11.219
in the first place.

10:11.244 --> 10:12.720
Well, Abs, I gotta tell him something.

10:12.744 --> 10:14.658
Tell him you love him, McGee.

10:14.682 --> 10:15.961
It works for me.

10:16.014 --> 10:17.192
Not all the time.

10:17.239 --> 10:18.433
Hi, Gibbs.

10:18.682 --> 10:19.682
Just in time.

10:20.557 --> 10:21.906
This is the mass spec

10:21.930 --> 10:24.797
on the mystery compounds in
Petty Officer Davidson's blood.

10:24.869 --> 10:27.846
It's organic and it's
definitely what killed him.

10:27.870 --> 10:28.835
Meet neriin,

10:28.870 --> 10:30.770
oleandrin and oleondroside.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.597
Friends of yours, Elf Lord?

10:32.621 --> 10:35.525
No, Gibbs. They're not
characters from Lord of the Rings.

10:35.559 --> 10:36.979
They're compounds...

10:37.246 --> 10:38.848
found in the oleander plant.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.410
What drug is made from that?

10:40.434 --> 10:42.144
None. It's pure poison.

10:43.060 --> 10:45.185
Our Petty Officer didn't OD.

10:45.431 --> 10:46.611
He was murdered.

10:54.432 --> 10:55.968
What language do I have to say it in?

10:55.992 --> 10:58.777
You obviously don't understand English.

11:00.992 --> 11:03.275
I said no!

11:05.245 --> 11:06.331
- Travis.
- Yeah, Tony.

11:06.388 --> 11:07.708
Can I get two Belvedere martinis.

11:07.736 --> 11:09.722
Straight up. Very dry.
Very cold. Twist of lemon.

11:09.768 --> 11:11.906
You are becoming a stalker.

11:12.493 --> 11:13.493
No.

11:13.558 --> 11:15.717
What else do you want to call it?

11:19.810 --> 11:21.218
Over is over.

11:21.266 --> 11:22.433
Forever over.

11:22.744 --> 11:23.722
No ciao,

11:23.746 --> 11:24.782
no "we'll meet again"

11:24.806 --> 11:26.101
because we won't.

11:32.309 --> 11:33.309
Hey.

11:33.744 --> 11:34.744
Hey.

11:40.746 --> 11:41.724
Cheers.

11:41.748 --> 11:42.748
Sorry.

11:43.810 --> 11:44.810
Sante.

11:47.873 --> 11:48.873
Yes.

11:49.687 --> 11:50.687
That was him.

11:51.249 --> 11:53.662
And no, I will not tell you his name.

11:53.686 --> 11:54.686
Did I ask?

11:55.124 --> 11:56.184
Your eyes did.

11:58.750 --> 12:00.580
What are they asking now?

12:01.434 --> 12:02.554
To skip dinner.

12:03.187 --> 12:04.367
You are amazing.

12:05.623 --> 12:07.351
I don't know how you do it.

12:07.375 --> 12:09.851
You always want to skip dinner, Tony.

12:09.875 --> 12:11.845
But not tonight, I'm famished.

12:12.313 --> 12:13.313
Me, too.

12:14.748 --> 12:16.501
Food first.

12:16.750 --> 12:17.750
All right.

12:18.978 --> 12:20.849
Our reservations aren't till 8:00.

12:20.873 --> 12:21.933
How 'bout, uh,

12:22.126 --> 12:23.613
some oysters to tide us over?

12:23.656 --> 12:26.599
The last thing you need
is an increased libido.

12:26.623 --> 12:28.540
You don't believe that
old wive tale, do you?

12:28.564 --> 12:29.564
It's true.

12:29.627 --> 12:31.975
Oysters are rich in rare amino acids

12:31.999 --> 12:34.238
that trigger increased
levels of sex hormones.

12:34.296 --> 12:36.040
Two dozen malpeques, please.

12:36.064 --> 12:36.854
We'll be at that table.

12:36.878 --> 12:38.118
And more alcohol!

12:39.729 --> 12:41.078
Mademoiselle.

12:41.835 --> 12:42.835
Merci.

12:49.065 --> 12:50.485
You look incredible.

12:52.514 --> 12:54.465
I'm glad you like it. It's my favorite.

12:56.263 --> 12:58.568
Wasn't talking about the dress.

12:59.890 --> 13:01.365
I meant you, Jeanne.

13:05.764 --> 13:06.764
Thank you.

13:09.202 --> 13:10.202
What's that?

13:11.328 --> 13:12.923
I'm working Wednesday.

13:13.640 --> 13:14.640
Wednesday?

13:15.390 --> 13:16.957
Valentine's Day.

13:18.412 --> 13:19.412
Yeah.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.617
Yeah.

13:20.641 --> 13:23.487
Comes around fast
every year, doesn't it.

13:23.704 --> 13:24.704
Yeah.

13:26.451 --> 13:27.751
Well, your gift...

13:29.267 --> 13:30.805
is still at the store because I...

13:30.829 --> 13:32.184
I never bought it.

13:32.827 --> 13:33.827
Sorry.

13:36.392 --> 13:38.276
You know how wonderful
it is to be with someone

13:38.321 --> 13:40.418
who doesn't even lie
about the little things?

13:42.142 --> 13:43.142
Go on.

13:43.646 --> 13:44.647
Open it.

13:44.688 --> 13:45.877
Oh, it's just not the box?

13:45.936 --> 13:48.843
- No.
- I was gonna say it's the nicest box

13:48.891 --> 13:50.381
- I've ever...
- I know, it is nice.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.694
Oh, come on.

13:52.762 --> 13:54.432
It's, uh, more permanent than the...

13:54.456 --> 13:56.461
last one I tagged you with.

13:56.953 --> 13:58.013
This is, uh...

13:58.268 --> 13:59.494
This is platinum.

13:59.518 --> 14:01.233
It's expensive, Jeanne.

14:01.394 --> 14:02.973
I'm a doctor. I can afford it.

14:05.953 --> 14:06.953
Mental Ward?

14:08.082 --> 14:09.617
You trying to tell me something?

14:09.641 --> 14:11.116
It worked last time.

14:11.520 --> 14:12.520
Yes, it did.

14:16.021 --> 14:18.616
I've never had a gift this unique.

14:20.332 --> 14:21.332
Or a woman.

14:24.625 --> 14:25.625
Thank you.

14:31.816 --> 14:33.458
He doesn't give up, does he?

14:33.516 --> 14:35.006
I'm going to change my number.

14:35.069 --> 14:36.536
Okay, don't be ridiculous.
Let me talk to him.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.127
- No!
- Believe me, I can...

14:38.178 --> 14:40.316
- I'll talk a little sense to him.
- I don't want you to get involved in my problem.

14:40.340 --> 14:41.871
I can handle it.

14:42.602 --> 14:44.137
If it doesn't go away...

14:44.753 --> 14:45.753
It will.

14:46.443 --> 14:47.443
I promise.

14:50.693 --> 14:52.228
Saved by the mollusk.

14:53.252 --> 14:54.252
Thanks.

14:54.476 --> 14:55.770
Here you go.

15:07.195 --> 15:08.550
I changed my mind.

15:09.735 --> 15:11.550
Let's skip dinner.

15:14.764 --> 15:16.256
Okay.

15:16.941 --> 15:17.941
Shakira.

15:18.382 --> 15:20.359
That's who this police
sketch reminds me of.

15:20.383 --> 15:21.383
Shakira.

15:21.695 --> 15:22.695
Yes?

15:23.071 --> 15:24.606
You know, the singer?

15:25.070 --> 15:27.195
The one who dances like this.

15:35.383 --> 15:37.441
You're not even
listening to me, are you?

15:39.571 --> 15:40.692
Look at this police sketch.

15:40.727 --> 15:41.692
The marine said

15:41.738 --> 15:44.423
this woman left the bar
with Petty Officer Davidson.

15:44.447 --> 15:46.217
She could be the killer.

15:46.632 --> 15:47.632
Hey.

15:52.258 --> 15:53.548
Where are we going?

15:53.572 --> 15:54.733
We're not going anywhere.

15:54.757 --> 15:55.859
Who are you taking, McGee?

15:55.883 --> 15:57.243
Agent Gibbs around?

15:57.947 --> 16:00.137
Brought him an early
Valentine's Day present.

16:05.496 --> 16:07.190
He's a junkie.

16:07.574 --> 16:09.609
Hangs out in the area where
we found your dead sailor.

16:09.633 --> 16:11.610
Morris thinks he saw something.

16:11.634 --> 16:13.800
What do you think, Detective Carson?

16:13.824 --> 16:15.409
It's, um, it's John.

16:16.699 --> 16:18.425
Um, love the accent by the way.

16:18.449 --> 16:18.989
It's, uh...

16:19.013 --> 16:20.078
Israeli, right?

16:20.949 --> 16:21.949
Not bad.

16:22.450 --> 16:24.235
Most people don't recognize it.

16:24.259 --> 16:26.426
I took a vacation there
a couple years ago.

16:26.450 --> 16:27.985
Back to the question.

16:28.263 --> 16:30.426
What makes you think
he knows anything...

16:30.450 --> 16:31.450
John?

16:31.760 --> 16:32.760
Well, um,

16:33.827 --> 16:35.715
mostly this, Tony.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.798
He had one of your Petty
Officers' credit cards on him.

16:42.076 --> 16:43.990
I got somebody that I
want you to meet, Frankie.

16:44.014 --> 16:46.024
This is Special Agent Gibbs.

16:46.327 --> 16:48.362
Wants to ask you a few questions.

16:48.386 --> 16:50.053
Look, I didn't do nothing wrong.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.116
I mean, I, I didn't even use the card.

16:52.140 --> 16:53.140
No problem.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.229
I just want to know how you got it.

16:56.251 --> 16:57.251
Oh, I found it.

16:57.305 --> 16:59.533
You know, in the street.

17:01.577 --> 17:04.744
Where do you keep your credit
cards, Detective Morris?

17:05.391 --> 17:08.054
Oh, like 99% of the
people on this planet,

17:08.078 --> 17:09.220
a wallet.

17:09.243 --> 17:10.114
- You?
- Yeah.

17:10.137 --> 17:11.137
Same. Same.

17:12.328 --> 17:15.051
You see, we got a problem
here, Frank, because.

17:15.994 --> 17:20.007
Petty Officer Davidson's wallet
was found lying next to his body.

17:20.041 --> 17:22.487
And his body wasn't out in the street.

17:23.888 --> 17:25.895
Well, you ever stop to think, uh,

17:25.949 --> 17:27.521
the guy could have dropped it?

17:28.829 --> 17:30.954
Man does raise a valid point.

17:31.959 --> 17:33.390
Yeah.

17:33.425 --> 17:35.708
Yeah, works for me.

17:36.079 --> 17:37.056
Good.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.080
So, I can...

17:38.393 --> 17:39.393
I, I can go?

17:39.643 --> 17:42.242
Uh, no. I think I'm gonna
charge you with murder instead.

17:42.266 --> 17:43.432
Wait, I didn't murder nobody!

17:43.456 --> 17:45.646
Look, he was still breathing...

17:52.082 --> 17:54.523
It's almost unfair
interrogating junkies.

17:54.588 --> 17:56.394
It's like shooting fish in a pond.

17:58.331 --> 18:00.336
I think you mean a barrel.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.681
Why would a fish be in a barrel?

18:05.083 --> 18:06.496
It's a good point, I never really

18:06.520 --> 18:07.726
thought about it before.

18:11.521 --> 18:13.301
Frankie, Frankie, Frankie.

18:16.584 --> 18:17.710
When I found your guy, uh,

18:18.419 --> 18:20.129
he was pretty wasted.

18:20.210 --> 18:21.210
Where?

18:21.517 --> 18:22.494
In an alley.

18:22.518 --> 18:23.698
Behind One Club.

18:24.958 --> 18:26.623
You saw him coming out of there?

18:26.647 --> 18:29.560
No. No, he, he was, was
lying over by some Dumpsters.

18:29.584 --> 18:32.312
All right, so I decided, I
decided to keep an eye on him,

18:32.336 --> 18:36.056
you know, to make sure
that he don't hurt himself.

18:36.960 --> 18:40.320
I think you need to
find a new line of work.

18:41.773 --> 18:43.483
He's dead, you retread.

18:43.895 --> 18:45.365
Not when I saw him!

18:45.710 --> 18:47.061
I mean, all I did,

18:47.085 --> 18:48.997
all right, was help
him into that restaurant

18:49.021 --> 18:51.689
and I just, I just waited
for him to pass out.

18:51.713 --> 18:53.303
So you could rob him?

18:54.836 --> 18:55.836
Well, yeah.

18:56.587 --> 18:57.812
Look, man, but I didn't...

18:57.836 --> 18:59.246
I didn't kill him.

18:59.647 --> 19:02.597
No, but you just left him there to die.

19:06.212 --> 19:08.248
This is really starting
to vex me, McGee.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.123
I mean, normally I love lamination

19:10.147 --> 19:11.689
because it collects fingerprints

19:11.713 --> 19:13.001
like you collect royalty checks.

19:13.025 --> 19:15.765
But this is completely sterile.

19:15.809 --> 19:18.623
Are you sure it was in
the Petty Officer's pocket?

19:18.837 --> 19:19.814
Yup.

19:19.838 --> 19:21.439
Well, then how did it get there?

19:21.463 --> 19:23.940
Either he put it in
there, or someone else did.

19:23.964 --> 19:25.314
Then there would be fingerprints.

19:25.338 --> 19:27.250
There would be oil from skin contact,

19:27.274 --> 19:29.377
residue from the environment it's in.

19:29.401 --> 19:30.566
They wiped it down.

19:30.590 --> 19:32.625
Why would they go to all that trouble?

19:32.649 --> 19:34.003
They could have just taken it.

19:34.027 --> 19:35.147
And believe me,

19:35.275 --> 19:37.315
they went to all that trouble.

19:37.339 --> 19:39.785
Maybe they wanted us to find it.

19:42.024 --> 19:43.739
Question is why?

19:53.154 --> 19:54.819
What does that look like to you?

19:54.843 --> 19:56.067
It's on the paper,

19:56.091 --> 19:57.931
but it's under the lamination.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.405
Ink?

19:59.779 --> 20:00.779
Possibly.

20:01.776 --> 20:04.486
I'm thinking it's a message for us.

20:07.154 --> 20:09.568
One Club's been on our
radar for the last year.

20:09.592 --> 20:12.068
Drugs, illegal gambling, prostitution.

20:12.092 --> 20:14.380
Why haven't you breasted them?

20:15.343 --> 20:16.375
She means busted.

20:16.438 --> 20:18.721
Oh, yes. Yes, busted. Sorry.

20:18.767 --> 20:19.860
It's a private club.

20:19.918 --> 20:21.998
We can't get in to get
enough evidence for a warrant.

20:22.041 --> 20:23.083
Why not raid it?

20:23.138 --> 20:24.694
If they're doing half of
what you think they are,

20:24.718 --> 20:25.631
you'll find evidence.

20:25.655 --> 20:26.756
Not without a warrant.

20:26.780 --> 20:28.632
Last time, I damn near lost my badge.

20:28.656 --> 20:30.945
Club's lawyers ripped into
the department, big time.

20:30.969 --> 20:32.499
Owner's a smart guy.

20:33.219 --> 20:34.820
His name's Scott Pell.

20:34.844 --> 20:36.508
Knows how to protect his clients.

20:36.532 --> 20:38.195
If you're a member of One Club,

20:38.219 --> 20:40.258
you can get away with
just about anything.

20:40.282 --> 20:42.803
It's not the kind of club
you expect to find a sailor.

20:42.838 --> 20:44.631
You gotta be rich or famous
to step through that door.

20:44.655 --> 20:47.140
Yeah, or have something they want.

20:48.074 --> 20:50.820
You two waiting for an engraved invite?

20:53.594 --> 20:54.571
On the surface,

20:54.595 --> 20:57.132
it's a moderately
priced Italian knockoff.

20:57.156 --> 20:58.635
But on the inside of the heel,

20:58.659 --> 21:00.079
a portable pharmacy.

21:00.221 --> 21:02.385
Twenty four tablets of Ecstasy.

21:02.409 --> 21:04.260
Well, that could have
gotten through the door.

21:04.284 --> 21:05.667
That's a good job, Abby.

21:05.715 --> 21:07.757
Oh, that was just the
warm-up act, Gibbs.

21:07.781 --> 21:10.496
The real show is in here with McGee.

21:12.407 --> 21:13.407
Boss.

21:13.722 --> 21:15.885
This card was definitely
planted at the crime scene.

21:15.909 --> 21:17.448
They wanted us to find it.

21:17.472 --> 21:18.885
Uh, how do you figure that?

21:18.909 --> 21:21.324
Well, the blood stain
was intentionally put

21:21.348 --> 21:22.450
underneath the lamination.

21:22.474 --> 21:23.699
A human blood stain.

21:23.723 --> 21:25.508
Well, that doesn't prove
that it was planted.

21:25.532 --> 21:28.134
They wanted us to take the
card out of the plastic.

21:28.158 --> 21:29.137
And who's they?

21:29.161 --> 21:31.176
Stop interrupting and listen.

21:31.660 --> 21:33.199
They being the person or persons

21:33.223 --> 21:35.325
who killed Petty Officer Davidson.

21:35.349 --> 21:37.135
Okay, here's where it gets weird.

21:37.159 --> 21:38.387
And when I say weird,

21:38.411 --> 21:40.385
I mean like the sick
and creepy kind of weird,

21:40.409 --> 21:41.763
not the good weird, 'cause
I'm a big fan of that...

21:41.787 --> 21:42.760
Abby.

21:42.784 --> 21:44.720
Um, all right, you're gonna need these.

21:47.099 --> 21:49.008
All right, McGee, hit the lights.

21:49.784 --> 21:51.326
We sprayed the card with Luminol

21:51.350 --> 21:52.576
to look for more blood splatter.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.998
And instead, we found this.

21:57.888 --> 21:59.046
It's written in blood.

22:02.093 --> 22:03.576
I'd say that's creepy.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.960
You think, DiNozzo.

22:13.815 --> 22:17.474
Abby analyzed the contents of
our petty officer's stomach.

22:17.527 --> 22:21.368
We now know how the
poison was administered.

22:21.457 --> 22:24.888
The oleander plant
leaves were first reduced

22:24.929 --> 22:27.181
to a fine powder, and then ingested.

22:27.220 --> 22:29.124
Judging by the absorption rate,

22:29.148 --> 22:32.033
it had to be in the form of a liquid.

22:35.210 --> 22:36.562
What's this stuff taste like, Ducky?

22:36.586 --> 22:37.749
Oh, extremely bitter.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.126
In order to disguise it,

22:39.150 --> 22:41.000
you'd have to use
something equally strong,

22:41.024 --> 22:42.324
- such as...
- Booze?

22:42.523 --> 22:44.500
- Yeah.
- Somebody spiked his drink?

22:44.524 --> 22:47.188
Well, considering his
blood alcohol level,

22:47.212 --> 22:48.917
I'd say more than one.

22:49.024 --> 22:51.625
How many shots of this
before you end up like he did?

22:51.649 --> 22:54.425
From that concentration,
no more than three or four,

22:54.472 --> 22:57.434
which brings me to the
real reason for this visit.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.377
The note found on the body.

23:00.401 --> 23:02.001
- "Expect more."
- Yeah.

23:02.025 --> 23:05.544
An average bottle contains 25 shots,

23:05.837 --> 23:07.564
enough to kill seven people,

23:07.588 --> 23:09.530
but an entire case?

23:09.776 --> 23:10.781
More than 60.

23:10.828 --> 23:13.127
Few cases, you wipe out
the entire nightclub.

23:13.151 --> 23:14.565
Well, bars and discotheques

23:14.589 --> 23:16.940
have been terrorist targets overseas.

23:16.964 --> 23:20.128
It's only a matter of time
before they try it here.

23:20.152 --> 23:23.628
Terrorists don't leave shiny
pink clue cards for us, Duck.

23:23.652 --> 23:24.691
No, they don't.

23:24.715 --> 23:26.049
Not do they leave threats

23:26.092 --> 23:28.691
that can only be read in a forensic lab.

23:28.715 --> 23:32.847
I believe the killer is trying
to show us how clever they are.

23:33.214 --> 23:36.148
"Expect more." He's
planning to do it again.

23:36.172 --> 23:37.172
Or she.

23:37.606 --> 23:41.185
Poison has been the weapon of
choice for women for centuries,

23:41.267 --> 23:45.130
except they tend to hide it
in food rather than drink.

23:45.703 --> 23:47.928
That would explain why
my last ex-wife spent

23:47.965 --> 23:49.347
so much time in the kitchen.

24:11.444 --> 24:13.128
If Petty Officer Davidson was drinking

24:13.152 --> 24:14.568
in this neighborhood Thursday night,

24:14.592 --> 24:15.576
it had to be here.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.723
Doesn't exactly look
like a celebrity hangout.

24:17.747 --> 24:19.819
That's why celebrities like it, Probie.

24:19.843 --> 24:22.301
Ordinary people don't
even know One Club exists.

24:22.325 --> 24:24.370
DiNozzo, find me the woman he was with,

24:24.413 --> 24:25.825
and McGee, get a warrant.

24:25.849 --> 24:26.474
On it, boss.

24:26.498 --> 24:27.476
On what grounds?

24:27.500 --> 24:29.023
Dead sailor's good for me.

24:29.047 --> 24:30.937
Metro doesn't work like that.

24:31.300 --> 24:32.080
Uh, then don't.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.309
Too late. We're involved.
I need grounds, Agent Gibbs.

24:34.333 --> 24:36.835
Your witness places
the victim at the club

24:36.859 --> 24:38.110
at the time of his murder.

24:38.134 --> 24:39.901
Outside the club.

24:39.925 --> 24:41.654
And he wasn't exactly a witness.

24:41.678 --> 24:43.940
He let him die so he could rob him.

24:52.790 --> 24:55.258
Agents Gibbs and Lee
to see you, Director.

24:56.600 --> 24:58.477
Let them in, Cynthia.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.484
What's the problem?

25:06.508 --> 25:08.554
Jurisdiction issues with Metro Police.

25:08.578 --> 25:10.056
They're insisting on a warrant.

25:10.080 --> 25:11.226
And this...

25:12.239 --> 25:14.214
legal person won't get me one.

25:14.238 --> 25:15.372
I've tried, Director.

25:15.396 --> 25:16.710
We don't have probable cause,

25:16.734 --> 25:18.297
I can't get a judge to sign off on it.

25:18.321 --> 25:19.349
We have a dead sailor.

25:19.373 --> 25:20.382
We've got a killer

25:20.406 --> 25:22.292
leaving us messages in human blood.

25:22.316 --> 25:24.537
But we need to get a
warrant, sir. Not sir... Gibbs.

25:24.561 --> 25:25.987
Special... Special Agent Gibbs.

25:26.011 --> 25:27.433
Where did you find her?

25:27.457 --> 25:28.761
Harvard Law School.

25:28.785 --> 25:30.810
We need a witness who
saw the petty officer

25:30.834 --> 25:31.914
inside of the club.

25:31.938 --> 25:33.516
We've got one!

25:35.557 --> 25:37.550
- Is there a witness?
- Yes.

25:37.574 --> 25:39.566
Metro Detective Morris informs me

25:39.590 --> 25:40.682
that he's a drug addict

25:40.706 --> 25:43.613
that no judge would
find reliable, Director.

25:43.817 --> 25:46.379
Who's running this
agency, Metro Police?!

25:46.403 --> 25:47.780
You know damn well who.

25:47.804 --> 25:51.323
Find me a witness, and I will
get you that warrant, sir.

25:52.060 --> 25:53.037
Special...

25:53.061 --> 25:54.219
Agent...

25:54.257 --> 25:55.469
Gibbs.

25:58.175 --> 25:59.520
All right.

26:02.900 --> 26:05.322
Don't take it personally, Michelle.

26:06.910 --> 26:08.461
He's right, Director.

26:08.764 --> 26:10.648
He usually is.

26:10.980 --> 26:13.708
That's what makes him
so damn irritating.

26:16.504 --> 26:17.749
Thanks.

26:28.842 --> 26:30.062
Excuse me. I need a prescription

26:30.086 --> 26:32.090
for this burning sensation in my loins.

26:32.114 --> 26:34.500
Are you trying to outspend me?

26:35.209 --> 26:36.873
A Bermuda weekend?

26:38.815 --> 26:41.190
What could be a more perfect Valentine?

26:44.149 --> 26:46.006
A weekend in the Bahamas?

26:47.759 --> 26:49.317
It's interesting, though.

26:51.117 --> 26:53.199
He and I must be a lot alike.

26:59.612 --> 27:01.156
You are...

27:02.121 --> 27:04.263
You are night and day.

27:04.543 --> 27:06.235
How does that work exactly?

27:06.259 --> 27:08.669
Am-Am I day and he's
night, or you switch us out?

27:08.693 --> 27:11.349
That was totally uncalled for, Tony.

27:15.231 --> 27:17.168
That was totally uncalled for.

27:17.294 --> 27:19.052
Was it, Jeanne?

27:19.531 --> 27:21.018
He still calls,

27:21.042 --> 27:23.880
plans a Valentine's
weekend in Bermuda with you.

27:23.904 --> 27:26.824
I'd say that's not a man
who understands it's over.

27:26.848 --> 27:28.871
It's over...

27:29.215 --> 27:30.500
for me.

27:32.007 --> 27:33.432
I'm not so sure.

27:33.813 --> 27:36.747
If you can't sell him, and
you won't let me handle it,

27:37.038 --> 27:38.439
maybe it's not over for you.

27:38.463 --> 27:39.610
Don't do this, Tony.

27:39.634 --> 27:41.365
Okay, what if I had an ex-girlfriend

27:41.389 --> 27:42.907
who was always calling me and planning

27:42.931 --> 27:44.810
little romantic getaways
for the two of us?

27:44.834 --> 27:47.156
- How would you feel?
- I wouldn't like it.

27:47.180 --> 27:48.180
Well...

27:48.311 --> 27:51.493
But I would trust you to handle it.

27:52.473 --> 27:54.742
And if I didn't handle it?

27:56.369 --> 27:58.445
Then it would be your problem.

27:59.614 --> 28:01.411
Just as this is mine.

28:02.413 --> 28:03.811
Exactly...

28:04.443 --> 28:05.548
wrong.

28:07.388 --> 28:08.707
This is our problem,

28:08.731 --> 28:09.770
Jeanne.

28:21.840 --> 28:23.578
We need to talk, Gibbs.

28:34.829 --> 28:36.235
Should we call the paramedics?

28:36.259 --> 28:37.407
No need.

28:37.431 --> 28:39.693
If they fight, it will be to the death.

28:43.109 --> 28:44.434
Talk.

28:44.494 --> 28:45.930
I used to be like you, Gibbs.

28:45.954 --> 28:47.431
You were never...

28:47.455 --> 28:48.906
like me.

28:51.645 --> 28:54.001
Got the dirtbags any way I could.

28:54.025 --> 28:56.933
Let the lawyers sweat the paperwork.

28:57.582 --> 28:59.196
About a year ago...

28:59.220 --> 29:01.226
I went into a hole down on Eighth.

29:01.250 --> 29:03.635
The bastard in there was a bad-ass.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.576
Rapist, pedophile.

29:05.669 --> 29:08.504
Scum you got to take off the
street to get sleep at night.

29:08.528 --> 29:11.275
I didn't have a warrant
or probable cause,

29:12.233 --> 29:13.558
but I knew...

29:14.625 --> 29:15.916
here,

29:16.331 --> 29:18.706
so I took him down hard.

29:19.795 --> 29:20.936
That it,

29:20.960 --> 29:22.930
or should I get a refill?

29:23.622 --> 29:25.972
His lawyer said it was a bad bust.

29:25.996 --> 29:27.015
No warrant.

29:27.039 --> 29:29.543
Judge agreed, Bad-ass walked.

29:30.195 --> 29:31.686
A month later,

29:32.828 --> 29:35.250
he raped and strangled
a six-year-old girl.

29:36.695 --> 29:38.718
I'm never gonna make that mistake again.

29:39.090 --> 29:40.707
Not getting a warrant...

29:41.663 --> 29:43.825
or not killing the bastard?

29:44.628 --> 29:46.598
Boss using the elevator
as an office again?

29:46.622 --> 29:48.419
Had to take the stairs.

29:49.477 --> 29:50.609
All right.

29:50.995 --> 29:53.191
Looky what I found.

29:54.366 --> 29:56.018
Marines gave a pretty good description

29:56.042 --> 29:57.692
of Davidson's last date.

29:57.716 --> 30:00.259
Lisa Delgado, age 23.

30:00.283 --> 30:01.433
Where'd you find her?

30:01.457 --> 30:03.596
There's only two parking lots within...

30:03.620 --> 30:05.068
within stumbling distance of the club.

30:05.092 --> 30:07.783
So, you showed the police
sketch to parking attendants?

30:07.807 --> 30:10.376
Yeah and they I. D.'d her.

30:10.400 --> 30:12.120
She's a regular at the One Club.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.675
Arrives alone and
usually leaves with her...

30:14.699 --> 30:17.729
Porsche or Ferrari or Mercedes SLR.

30:17.753 --> 30:18.730
Good thinking, DiNozzo.

30:18.754 --> 30:20.173
Did you think to pick her up?

30:20.197 --> 30:21.463
Uh, I did.

30:21.487 --> 30:23.691
Roommate hasn't seen her
since Thursday. Not unusual.

30:23.715 --> 30:25.231
She can be gone for days.

30:25.255 --> 30:27.827
She is, after all, in
the escort business.

30:27.851 --> 30:28.986
The club owner, Pell,

30:29.010 --> 30:30.792
lets some of the escorts stay overnight.

30:30.816 --> 30:32.004
So, she could be there now.

30:32.028 --> 30:34.915
If she is, we'll be
there when she comes out.

30:35.485 --> 30:37.222
And if she's not?

30:37.715 --> 30:39.778
We'll be there when she goes in.

30:51.272 --> 30:52.804
That, uh... that Feb's?

30:52.828 --> 30:54.442
Pro cheerleaders

30:54.466 --> 30:55.561
in the off-season.

30:55.585 --> 30:58.585
Yeah, buddy in Vice told
me one of them's a man.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.023
No.

31:01.739 --> 31:02.838
Well,

31:02.881 --> 31:05.000
I probably shouldn't be looking
at it anyway. I'm trying to

31:05.024 --> 31:08.304
wrap my head around the idea
of a monogamous relationship.

31:08.328 --> 31:10.582
That takes serious retraining.

31:10.606 --> 31:12.037
Tell me about it.

31:12.742 --> 31:14.506
You're not in love, are you?

31:15.969 --> 31:18.274
- Could be.
- Could be, my friend...

31:18.298 --> 31:21.332
- isn't love.
- Isn't love. I know, I know.

31:22.892 --> 31:24.168
It's complicated,

31:24.192 --> 31:25.261
John.

31:25.285 --> 31:26.358
Aren't they all?

31:26.382 --> 31:28.100
No. Usually, they're pretty simple.

31:28.124 --> 31:29.897
Fall in love, three weeks later,

31:29.921 --> 31:31.094
fall out of love.

31:31.118 --> 31:32.683
It's been my life.

31:32.707 --> 31:34.358
Except for once.

31:35.519 --> 31:37.263
I got engaged.

31:39.296 --> 31:40.424
What happened?

31:40.448 --> 31:41.740
What do you think?

31:41.782 --> 31:43.307
I screwed it up.

31:43.664 --> 31:44.995
I, um,

31:45.683 --> 31:47.493
slept with her best friend.

31:49.231 --> 31:51.097
That's not nice, John.

31:51.121 --> 31:52.426
Yeah, I know.

31:53.656 --> 31:55.493
She was the one, too.

31:55.720 --> 31:56.918
She's...

31:57.185 --> 31:58.390
smart.

31:58.650 --> 31:59.994
Beautiful.

32:00.815 --> 32:02.033
Funny.

32:03.164 --> 32:05.619
The whole marriage package.

32:08.159 --> 32:09.312
Oh, well.

32:09.336 --> 32:10.993
I'll always have

32:11.361 --> 32:14.258
April 2005 to keep me company.

32:14.282 --> 32:16.777
- Hooters Girls of D. C.?
- Yeah.

32:16.939 --> 32:18.635
Collector's edition.

32:18.659 --> 32:19.659
Yeah.

32:27.084 --> 32:28.475
Baby steps.

32:30.481 --> 32:32.438
This is really weird.

32:32.476 --> 32:35.117
I would agree. What exactly is this?

32:35.534 --> 32:36.740
It's a chick-e-baby.

32:36.764 --> 32:38.378
- My friend makes them.
- Why?

32:38.402 --> 32:39.843
For Valentine's Day.

32:39.867 --> 32:42.717
I think I may be confusing
this holiday with another.

32:42.741 --> 32:43.863
What do you got, Abs?

32:43.887 --> 32:46.136
Oh, I'm not sure, yet.

32:48.844 --> 32:50.144
I got a partial match

32:50.168 --> 32:53.035
on the blood the killer used
to write his calling card.

32:53.059 --> 32:54.231
Who is he?

32:54.805 --> 32:55.782
He's a she.

32:55.806 --> 32:58.241
Our Petty Officer's murder is a woman.

32:58.732 --> 32:59.709
I don't think so.

32:59.733 --> 33:01.440
You don't think a woman can kill

33:01.464 --> 33:02.810
and leave a calling card?

33:02.834 --> 33:03.902
Not this one.

33:03.926 --> 33:06.361
She was murdered two months ago.

33:14.303 --> 33:16.763
Sandra Thompson, age 24.

33:16.787 --> 33:19.250
Arrested seven times for prostitution.

33:19.274 --> 33:21.645
Found murdered in Canal Park,

33:21.669 --> 33:23.373
December 24.

33:23.783 --> 33:25.275
Christmas Eve.

33:25.299 --> 33:27.207
- Sad.
- No day's a good day

33:27.231 --> 33:29.393
to be stabbed 22 times, Miss Sciuto.

33:29.417 --> 33:30.838
At least she didn't feel anything.

33:30.862 --> 33:32.653
All the wounds were post-mortem.

33:32.677 --> 33:33.386
What killed her?

33:33.410 --> 33:37.550
She OD'd on something
called... nerhine...

33:37.574 --> 33:38.919
Neriin

33:39.000 --> 33:40.856
and oleandroside.

33:40.941 --> 33:43.133
That's the same thing that
killed the petty officer.

33:43.157 --> 33:46.078
That would've been nice to
know two days ago, Detective.

33:46.102 --> 33:48.746
Hey, don't bite my
ass. This isn't my case.

33:48.770 --> 33:50.336
Did you ask whoever's case it was

33:50.360 --> 33:53.117
if they found a pink card on the body?

33:54.006 --> 33:55.108
I did.

33:55.132 --> 33:56.192
They didn't.

33:56.216 --> 33:57.648
The only clue here is

33:57.672 --> 33:59.322
a bloody shoe print.

34:00.180 --> 34:02.117
There a photo in the file?

34:02.503 --> 34:03.937
It is the case file, Gibbs.

34:03.961 --> 34:06.257
- McGee.
- Excuse me, Detective.

34:12.710 --> 34:15.710
All that blood and just one print?

34:15.815 --> 34:17.679
It was his only mistake.

34:17.703 --> 34:18.742
McGee.

34:27.306 --> 34:29.076
It wasn't a mistake.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.255
You were right, Tony.

34:36.252 --> 34:38.121
Maybe it wasn't over for me.

34:38.772 --> 34:41.114
If it was, I would
have told him about you.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.212
He doesn't know?

34:44.357 --> 34:45.815
He does now.

34:47.081 --> 34:48.322
Why didn't you tell him?

34:48.346 --> 34:50.828
I didn't want to answer all
those stupid questions that

34:50.851 --> 34:52.166
men ask when it's over and they know

34:52.190 --> 34:53.928
there's another man is in your life.

34:53.952 --> 34:55.121
Like, uh,

34:55.145 --> 34:56.909
"Is he better looking than me or

34:56.933 --> 34:58.299
is he better in bed?"

34:58.323 --> 34:59.848
Exactly like that.

34:59.872 --> 35:00.884
Is he?

35:02.788 --> 35:04.279
That was a joke.

35:04.651 --> 35:05.803
Sort of..

35:06.666 --> 35:08.818
You're better in almost all categories,

35:08.842 --> 35:09.934
Tony.

35:10.311 --> 35:11.563
Almost?

35:13.186 --> 35:14.424
Sort of.

35:15.070 --> 35:16.275
I gotta go.

35:17.104 --> 35:18.648
I love you, Tony.

35:19.653 --> 35:21.343
I love you, too, Jeanne.

35:27.360 --> 35:29.078
Well, I know that look.

35:29.322 --> 35:30.487
What look?

35:30.651 --> 35:32.475
The cold-feet look.

35:33.217 --> 35:34.205
You asked her to marry you

35:34.229 --> 35:36.258
and now you wonder if your life is over.

35:36.282 --> 35:37.964
I didn't ask her to marry me.

35:37.988 --> 35:39.260
You gonna?

35:42.616 --> 35:44.187
I can't live a lie.

35:44.211 --> 35:46.188
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

35:48.318 --> 35:50.500
I don't want to end up like you.

35:50.935 --> 35:52.817
Oh, hell, that's easy.

35:52.841 --> 35:54.631
Don't sleep with her best friend?

35:54.738 --> 35:55.990
Don't drink.

35:59.439 --> 36:01.417
Think I'd have blown the best
thing to ever happen to me

36:01.441 --> 36:02.851
if I was sober?

36:03.707 --> 36:05.178
Sorry, John.

36:06.260 --> 36:07.459
Don't be.

36:08.581 --> 36:10.118
Because of her...

36:10.651 --> 36:12.055
I quit drinking.

36:22.527 --> 36:23.507
Here.

36:23.531 --> 36:25.194
Look at the outside edges.

36:26.938 --> 36:28.366
Did you ever read MAD Magazine?

36:28.390 --> 36:29.111
- No.
- No.

36:29.135 --> 36:31.296
Until my mother found them
and burned them in the yard.

36:31.320 --> 36:32.744
Oh, my God!

36:33.480 --> 36:35.010
It's exactly like

36:35.034 --> 36:37.170
the back cover MAD Magazine.

36:43.717 --> 36:45.100
"Dead whore"?

36:45.124 --> 36:47.542
The shoe print's not a
mistake, J. D., it's a message.

36:47.566 --> 36:49.617
Like "Expect more"
written on the pink card.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.343
Which was also written in
Sandra Thompson's blood.

36:52.367 --> 36:54.038
We're dealing with a serial killer.

36:54.062 --> 36:55.795
If it's a serial killing,

36:55.819 --> 36:58.347
shouldn't your dead sailor be a whore?

37:08.657 --> 37:09.889
Hey, Matt.

37:09.988 --> 37:11.057
Have a good time.

37:11.081 --> 37:13.477
Why couldn't you guys get
a hot female cop inside?

37:13.501 --> 37:14.454
Tried.

37:14.478 --> 37:16.085
Got stopped at the door every time.

37:16.109 --> 37:17.402
Not hot enough.

37:17.426 --> 37:18.472
You believe that?

37:18.496 --> 37:19.383
No.

37:19.407 --> 37:22.653
Hate to say it, but I think
someone in Metro tips the owner.

37:23.394 --> 37:24.393
And there he is,

37:24.417 --> 37:25.736
at the door.

37:25.843 --> 37:27.173
Any problems, Matt?

37:27.197 --> 37:29.326
None so far, Mr. Pell.

37:29.982 --> 37:31.399
Thought Metro might hit us with another

37:31.423 --> 37:33.984
warrant after what
happened Thursday night.

37:35.881 --> 37:36.973
Yeah?

37:37.575 --> 37:39.146
Hey, boss, what's up?

37:39.211 --> 37:40.188
We're going in.

37:40.212 --> 37:42.050
- You got a warrant?
- No.

37:42.074 --> 37:44.822
No, we've got somebody rich and famous.

38:00.296 --> 38:01.289
McGeek?

38:01.313 --> 38:02.472
No.

38:02.619 --> 38:04.372
A very famous novelist.

38:04.396 --> 38:06.303
Thom E. Gemcity.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.304
Who?

38:07.328 --> 38:08.366
Don't ask.

38:08.390 --> 38:09.394
John,

38:09.418 --> 38:10.972
I'd vomit explaining.

38:10.996 --> 38:12.914
McGee, if Delgado's inside,

38:12.938 --> 38:15.217
you get her out quietly.

38:15.726 --> 38:16.703
How?

38:16.727 --> 38:19.973
Well, she's a hooker,
Tim. Use your imagination.

38:20.776 --> 38:21.753
Lee,

38:21.777 --> 38:24.295
can you please pretend you
want to be here with us?

38:24.319 --> 38:25.296
I'm trying.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.371
P. S., I don't know where your Sig is,

38:27.395 --> 38:29.184
but I'm having trouble walking.

38:29.208 --> 38:31.324
Snuggle up, Lee, it's fun.

38:32.991 --> 38:34.422
Names, please.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.612
Thom E. Gemcity.

38:36.823 --> 38:38.746
Thought I recognized you.

38:38.855 --> 38:39.965
Deep Six, right?

38:39.989 --> 38:41.374
That's the one.

38:41.773 --> 38:43.285
I'm a big fan.

38:44.081 --> 38:45.058
Go right in.

38:45.082 --> 38:46.374
Thank you.

38:47.937 --> 38:49.094
I gotta write a book.

38:49.118 --> 38:50.895
You should read one first.

38:51.479 --> 38:53.914
Hey, woman in the alley. Camera three.

38:55.182 --> 38:56.985
Tighter on her face.

39:03.125 --> 39:04.798
It could be Delgado. Right size.

39:04.822 --> 39:05.842
That's the best I can do.

39:05.866 --> 39:07.207
Check her out, Tony.

39:07.231 --> 39:08.311
John, you go with him.

39:08.335 --> 39:09.520
All right.

39:22.852 --> 39:26.058
I thought we agreed you weren't
gonna come around here for a few days.

39:28.299 --> 39:29.793
That's Delgado.

39:29.817 --> 39:31.523
Tony, that's Delgado in the alley.

39:31.547 --> 39:34.090
She's got company. Move! Now! Move!

39:34.427 --> 39:36.473
Cops are after me. I
gotta get out of town.

39:36.497 --> 39:38.127
I'm not stopping you.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.931
I need money.

39:40.091 --> 39:41.245
Why don't you use the thousand dollars

39:41.269 --> 39:43.273
that sailor gave you to
leave the back door of my club

39:43.297 --> 39:45.141
open last Thursday night?

39:45.245 --> 39:46.802
I tell you what it happened.

39:47.099 --> 39:48.390
Excuse me?

39:48.963 --> 39:51.644
You forced a spiked
drink down his throat

39:51.668 --> 39:53.013
and killed him.

39:53.231 --> 39:54.662
Matt caught that guy

39:54.686 --> 39:57.088
trying to slip you a roofie.

39:57.145 --> 39:58.575
You should be grateful he saw it.

39:58.599 --> 40:00.379
- It wasn't a roofie.
- Then what was it?

40:00.403 --> 40:01.782
I don't know. Whatever it was,

40:01.806 --> 40:03.776
that freak was trying to kill me.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.248
Well, I guess that
means I saved your life.

40:06.566 --> 40:07.978
Come inside, we'll talk about it there.

40:08.002 --> 40:09.061
No.

40:09.085 --> 40:10.244
You just...

40:10.570 --> 40:13.147
Just give me five green and I am gone.

40:13.171 --> 40:15.002
I'll give it to you inside.

40:15.195 --> 40:17.238
I'll never come out of there alive.

40:20.296 --> 40:21.542
Lisa...

40:21.566 --> 40:23.396
you're probably right.

40:24.859 --> 40:25.963
Forget about the money!

40:25.987 --> 40:27.181
I won't say a word, I swear!

40:27.205 --> 40:28.855
Yeah, you will. First time

40:28.879 --> 40:31.310
a cop pulls you over for tricking.

40:31.663 --> 40:32.997
Lisa, you'll deal.

40:33.021 --> 40:34.739
And I'll be the card.

40:37.688 --> 40:39.665
Freeze! Federal agents!

40:39.740 --> 40:41.497
Damn cops.

41:03.752 --> 41:05.014
Did we hit her?

41:05.038 --> 41:06.015
No.

41:06.039 --> 41:07.776
Looks like he broke her neck.

41:10.220 --> 41:11.259
John.

41:11.336 --> 41:12.336
John!

41:13.267 --> 41:14.244
Officer down.

41:14.268 --> 41:17.580
6618 Chillum Road, Northwest.

41:18.830 --> 41:20.022
You're going to be okay, buddy.

41:20.046 --> 41:21.023
Try not to move.

41:21.047 --> 41:22.389
Hang on.

41:24.421 --> 41:25.771
Okay, all right.

41:25.795 --> 41:27.353
You're gonna be fine.

41:28.648 --> 41:29.966
Liar.

41:31.117 --> 41:32.604
Stay with us, Carson.

41:32.628 --> 41:34.651
You gotta stay with us. Okay?

42:14.412 --> 42:16.356
I should've caught this, guys.

42:16.380 --> 42:17.574
Metro had the bloody print

42:17.598 --> 42:19.257
for two months, they didn't catch it.

42:19.281 --> 42:20.910
Yeah, but I had.

42:20.934 --> 42:23.808
Petty ficer Davidson's
boot the whole time.

42:23.832 --> 42:25.947
You thought the petty
officer was the victim,

42:25.971 --> 42:27.781
not the killer, Abby.

42:30.496 --> 42:32.193
There's no excuse.

42:34.501 --> 42:36.002
It's ironic, isn't it?

42:36.026 --> 42:39.152
A serial killer forced
to drink his own poison.

42:40.986 --> 42:42.723
It'll make... book.
