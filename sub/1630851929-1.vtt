<i>No. No way.
Matt wasn't even driving.</i>

16:52.344 --> 16:54.847
<i>-Five people died.
Shit.</i>

16:54.888 --> 16:56.181
Matt was in the hospital
for weeks.

16:56.223 --> 16:57.474
<i>Shattered femur,</i>

16:57.516 --> 16:59.351
<i>major surgery.</i>

16:59.393 --> 17:01.478
<i>That whole thing was just
a really tragic accident.</i>

17:01.520 --> 17:05.149
<i>In fact,
I bet his record is spotless.</i>

17:08.777 --> 17:11.447
<i>Okay, maybe a few spots.</i>

17:11.488 --> 17:13.574
<i>Is there any progress
on putting up that stop sign</i>

17:13.615 --> 17:15.451
<i>over by Louis's Package Store?</i>

17:17.077 --> 17:18.454
<i>That's an accident
waiting to happen.</i>

17:18.495 --> 17:19.788
<i>-That's all I'm saying.</i>

17:19.830 --> 17:20.664
<i>Thanks for your time, Dennis.</i>

17:20.706 --> 17:21.665
<i>I will let you know</i>

17:21.707 --> 17:22.833
<i>if anything else turns up.</i>

17:22.875 --> 17:24.752
<i>Sure thing.</i>

17:24.793 --> 17:26.211
<i>See ya, folks.</i>

17:27.129 --> 17:29.381
<i>So, no good, huh?</i>

17:29.423 --> 17:31.008
<i>The same as always.</i>

17:31.050 --> 17:33.343
<i>No body, no pattern,</i>

17:33.385 --> 17:34.845
<i>no case.</i>

17:34.887 --> 17:38.015
<i>And no funding.</i>

17:38.057 --> 17:40.184
<i>Until one of these women
turns up dead.</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:44.396
<i>Hey, my money's on you.</i>

17:46.023 --> 17:47.816
<i>Line dancing tonight?</i>

17:47.858 --> 17:49.109
<i>What time?</i>

17:50.235 --> 17:51.695
<i>-Oh.
Oh.</i>

17:51.737 --> 17:53.030
<i>I thought it was more
of a-a group thing.</i>

17:53.072 --> 17:55.407
<i>My bad. You two have fun.</i>

17:55.449 --> 17:56.825
<i>See you tonight.</i>

17:56.867 --> 17:59.203
<i>Bye.</i>

17:59.244 --> 18:01.121
<i>lighthearted music</i>

18:04.917 --> 18:06.460
<i>Sorry.</i>

18:06.502 --> 18:08.295
<i>Mad dash.
Thought you'd appreciate</i>

18:08.337 --> 18:09.713
<i>seeing your girlfriend
in something other</i>

18:09.755 --> 18:11.590
<i>than a state-issued uniform.</i>

18:11.632 --> 18:13.133
<i>-You look cute in that uniform.</i>

18:13.175 --> 18:15.427
<i>Oh. That's why I like you,
Jim Lindsay.</i>

18:20.641 --> 18:23.435
<i>Once I had a love
and it was a gas</i>

18:25.229 --> 18:27.648
<i>Soon turned out
had a heart of glass</i>

18:28.357 --> 18:30.567
<i>- Seemed like the real thing</i>
<i>Aw, Esther.</i>

18:30.609 --> 18:33.362
<i>She never misses a chance to
break out that rhinestone skirt.</i>

18:33.403 --> 18:36.657
<i>Mistrust, love's gone behind</i>

18:36.698 --> 18:37.950
<i>I'm gonna get you that drink.</i>

18:39.034 --> 18:41.995
<i>Hola, Ramón.
¿Cómo están Lydia y los niños?</i>

18:42.037 --> 18:44.498
<i>Mi familia es genial.
Gracias a Dios.</i>

18:44.540 --> 18:46.166
<i>-What's up, Jim?
- Hey, Ramon.</i>

18:46.208 --> 18:47.751
<i>You're working
on a school night?</i>

18:47.793 --> 18:49.586
<i>School has finals all week.</i>

18:49.628 --> 18:51.255
<i>Ergo, I don't have
to grade anything.</i>

18:51.296 --> 18:53.215
<i>So, picking up some extra shifts
before the holidays.</i>

18:53.257 --> 18:54.633
<i>Got it.</i>

18:54.675 --> 18:57.052
<i>Chivas, rocks. IPA.
And a veggie nachos?</i>

18:57.094 --> 18:58.095
<i>Am I that predictable?</i>

18:58.137 --> 18:59.638
<i>Want to shake it up?</i>

18:59.680 --> 19:01.306
<i>-I got a pickleback special.
No.</i>

19:01.348 --> 19:03.475
<i>We're good.
Uh, just put it on my tab.</i>

19:03.517 --> 19:06.562
<i>No need. Matt Caldwell's
buying everyone a round.</i>

19:07.521 --> 19:09.815
<i>Yo! It's Jim! Jim!</i>

19:09.857 --> 19:12.484
<i>Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim!</i>

19:12.526 --> 19:14.903
<i>Jim! Jim! Jim! Jim!</i>

19:14.945 --> 19:16.697
<i>Put it on my tab anyway.</i>

19:16.738 --> 19:17.948
<i>Okay.</i>

19:17.990 --> 19:19.199
<i>Chivas, rocks. IPA.</i>

19:19.241 --> 19:21.451
<i>-Nachos.
- Yeah.</i>

19:23.787 --> 19:24.955
<i>Chug. Give me
the fucking bottle.</i>

19:26.415 --> 19:28.584
<i>Last thing that guy needs
is more liquor.</i>

19:28.625 --> 19:30.878
<i>Or more firepower.</i>

19:30.919 --> 19:32.713
<i>You know the messed-up part?</i>

19:32.754 --> 19:34.756
<i>FBI gets backed up and half
the flags clear automatically.</i>

19:34.798 --> 19:37.259
<i>People fall through the cracks
all the time.</i>

19:40.470 --> 19:42.598
<i>You're off the clock.
Let's not talk about work.</i>

19:42.639 --> 19:43.932
<i>Let's dance.</i>

19:43.974 --> 19:45.976
<i>Can't let Esther and Alan
show us up.</i>

19:46.018 --> 19:48.437
<i>Lost inside</i>

19:48.478 --> 19:50.063
<i>- Adorable illusion</i>
<i>-Ooh.</i>

19:50.105 --> 19:52.441
<i>-Yeah.
<i>- And I cannot hide</i></i>

19:52.482 --> 19:54.109
<i>I'm the one you're using</i>

19:54.151 --> 19:56.028
<i>Yeah.</i>

19:58.030 --> 20:00.991
<i>Cruising, yeah</i>

20:16.673 --> 20:18.884
Iron Lake's about
two miles that way, my man.

20:18.926 --> 20:20.886
<i>low, somber music</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:34.775
<i>- In your mind</i>
<i></i>

20:34.816 --> 20:37.277
<i>A secret waits inside</i>

20:38.654 --> 20:40.948
<i>A place that you can't find</i>

20:40.989 --> 20:43.033
<i>Jim!</i>

20:43.075 --> 20:45.077
<i>Look at you,
getting all extracurricular</i>

20:45.118 --> 20:47.120
<i>on a Tuesday night.
Now we're talkin'.</i>

20:47.162 --> 20:49.206
<i>-Hey, Matt.
- I'm having a party tomorrow</i>

20:49.248 --> 20:50.958
<i>at my dad's place.
You should come.</i>

20:50.999 --> 20:53.710
<i>I'll, uh... see.</i>

20:53.752 --> 20:55.587
<i>Great.</i>

20:55.629 --> 20:56.880
<i>Hey, listen.</i>

20:58.298 --> 20:59.549
<i>I was thinking.</i>

21:00.509 --> 21:02.219
<i>Why don't we get out of here?</i>

21:02.261 --> 21:04.263
<i>You could open up your shop,
give me that rifle.</i>

21:04.304 --> 21:06.598
<i>My guys and I, we want
to go hunting in the morning.</i>

21:06.640 --> 21:08.725
<i>If your background check clears,
you can come and pick it up</i>

21:08.767 --> 21:10.352
<i>at the store in the morning.</i>

21:10.394 --> 21:12.271
<i>I'm sure your buds
are gonna be really impressed</i>

21:12.312 --> 21:13.689
<i>with the size of your gun.</i>

21:22.489 --> 21:23.907
<i>Man.</i>

21:23.949 --> 21:26.410
<i>This Eagle Scout
loves his rules!</i>

21:26.451 --> 21:27.869
<i>-Eh...
- You know what?</i>

21:27.911 --> 21:30.289
<i>Why don't you come to the party
anyway?</i>

21:30.330 --> 21:31.957
<i>You never know.</i>

21:32.958 --> 21:35.294
<i>Maybe you'll even enjoy
yourself.</i>

21:36.336 --> 21:39.631
<i>Find a way somehow</i>

21:41.049 --> 21:42.634
<i>Girlfriend's a cop, huh?</i>

21:43.635 --> 21:45.804
<i>Should probably come stag.</i>

21:45.846 --> 21:48.307
<i>There's gonna be
a lot of red flags there,</i>

21:48.348 --> 21:50.392
<i>if you know what I mean.</i>

21:51.685 --> 21:56.315
<i>Release me to the night</i>

21:56.356 --> 21:58.358
<i>Oh, oh</i>

21:58.400 --> 21:59.651
<i>How much is a plain burger,</i>

21:59.693 --> 22:01.111
<i>without cheese or anything?</i>

22:01.153 --> 22:02.112
<i>$7.50.</i>

22:02.154 --> 22:03.613
<i>What if I don't get fries?</i>

22:03.655 --> 22:05.157
<i>Doesn't come with fries, honey.</i>

22:06.700 --> 22:07.909
<i>Hey, Tess.</i>

22:07.951 --> 22:10.287
<i>Put it on my tab. Fries, too.</i>

22:11.455 --> 22:12.956
<i>Are you sure, ma'am?</i>

22:12.998 --> 22:14.333
<i>I'm extra sure
if you don't call me "ma'am."</i>

22:14.374 --> 22:16.168
<i>You got it.</i>

22:16.209 --> 22:18.670
<i>Thanks. Seriously.</i>

22:19.671 --> 22:21.506
<i>You're not from around here.</i>

22:21.548 --> 22:23.842
<i>Taking the first bus out
tomorrow.</i>

22:23.884 --> 22:25.594
<i>Just got to make sure
I got the fare.</i>

22:28.805 --> 22:30.140
<i>Just take this.</i>

22:30.182 --> 22:31.683
<i>Just in case.</i>

22:31.725 --> 22:33.352
<i>And if you need a place
to stay tonight,</i>

22:33.393 --> 22:35.437
<i>Desiree over there,</i>

22:35.479 --> 22:37.606
<i>she runs a shelter
just down the road.</i>

22:38.565 --> 22:40.192
<i>I'm good.</i>

22:40.233 --> 22:41.860
<i>But wow.</i>

22:41.902 --> 22:43.195
<i>Thanks.</i>

22:54.373 --> 22:56.166
<i>-Who was that?</i>

22:56.208 --> 22:57.542
<i>Lost kid.</i>

22:57.584 --> 22:59.586
<i>My brand of community outreach.</i>

22:59.628 --> 23:02.047
<i>Besides, who checks
my petty cash vouchers?</i>

23:02.089 --> 23:04.216
<i>Mm, that'd be me.</i>

23:04.257 --> 23:05.592
<i>That was kind of you.</i>

23:08.637 --> 23:11.139
<i>Hey, you want to get out
of here?</i>

23:11.181 --> 23:13.517
<i>You can pull me over
by the old Solly farm.</i>

23:13.558 --> 23:15.394
<i>-Mmm.</i>

23:17.938 --> 23:21.525
<i>-Uh, it's my smart doorbell.</i>

23:21.566 --> 23:25.028
<i>Audrey's got
way too many kids over.</i>

23:25.070 --> 23:26.571
<i>Oh, aren't you glad
they didn't have these things</i>

23:26.613 --> 23:28.031
<i>when we were younger?</i>

23:28.073 --> 23:29.825
<i>You better believe it.</i>

23:29.866 --> 23:31.743
<i>Time to be a mom.</i>

23:31.785 --> 23:33.078
<i>-Okay.

<i>when you're off the clock,</i>

23:36.123 --> 23:38.166

<i>Would be "haunted"</i>

26:21.037 --> 26:23.999
<i>I touch the clothes

<i>That still retain
your shape and lines</i>

26:26.543 --> 26:28.920

33:08.861 --> 33:10.238
<i>Turned the boat away.</i>

33:10.279 --> 33:12.323
<i>Totally yielded.</i>

48:32.951 --> 48:34.161
<i>you're right.
Who are we fucking kidding?</i>

48:34.202 --> 48:36.038
<i>It's not so much that I was.</i>

48:37.998 --> 48:39.458
<i>It's that I am.</i>

48:39.499 --> 48:43.462
<i>Okay, ok-okay, okay. Um...</i>

48:43.503 --> 48:46.214
This is
about the boat, right? Hmm?

48:46.256 --> 48:47.966
<i>Yeah, the part
where you were driving.</i>

48:48.008 --> 48:49.426
<i>The part
where the other guy yielded.</i>

48:49.468 --> 48:51.178
<i>The part
where you rammed him anyway.</i>

48:51.219 --> 48:53.305
<i>The part where five people died</i>

48:53.347 --> 48:55.432
<i>-because of you!
- All right, all right! Huh.</i>

48:55.474 --> 48:58.018
<i>I did everything you said
on the boat, okay? It's true.</i>

48:58.060 --> 49:00.187
<i>I admit it. I was wrong.</i>

49:00.228 --> 49:01.271
<i>I was wrong!</i>

49:01.313 --> 49:02.773
<i>Just please,</i>

49:02.814 --> 49:05.817
<i>-please--
- You shot my deer!</i>

49:05.859 --> 49:08.904
<i>And you almost... killed... me!</i>

49:08.946 --> 49:12.741
<i>I promise! I promise, I will
never do anything like it again.</i>

49:12.783 --> 49:14.534
<i>I-I-I swear to you.</i>

49:14.576 --> 49:16.620
<i>I promised the same thing
and look at me now.</i>

49:16.662 --> 49:18.747
<i>Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait!</i>

49:18.789 --> 49:21.083
<i>You don't understand!
It's not my fault!</i>

49:21.124 --> 49:22.709
<i>It's not my fault!</i>

49:22.751 --> 49:25.253
Okay?
My mom died when I was eight!

49:25.295 --> 49:27.631
My dad, he was never
around. He was always working!

49:27.673 --> 49:32.719
<i>I-I-I-I had-- I had
a sh-shitty childhood, okay?!</i>

49:34.763 --> 49:37.349
<i>You're blaming this
on bad parenting?</i>

49:37.391 --> 49:39.393
<i>It's true.
It's not my fault, okay?</i>

49:39.434 --> 49:40.769
<i>I didn't have anyone.</i>

49:40.811 --> 49:43.313
<i>I had-- I had nothing.</i>

49:43.355 --> 49:46.066
<i>I had no compass.
I-I was just...</i>

49:46.108 --> 49:48.568
<i>You know, I lost both my parents
when I was young, too.</i>

49:54.449 --> 49:55.993
<i>I wouldn't have had
any direction</i>

49:56.034 --> 49:57.661
<i>if it wasn't for Harry.</i>

49:59.788 --> 50:01.331
<i>Who's Harry?</i>

50:01.373 --> 50:03.834
<i>He adopted me.</i>

50:03.875 --> 50:05.419
<i>Th-Then you understand.</i>

50:05.460 --> 50:07.671
<i>You get it.</i>

50:07.713 --> 50:09.965
<i>So you're not gonna kill me!</i>

50:12.801 --> 50:15.429
<i>We're past the point
of no return on that one.</i>

50:19.516 --> 50:21.226
<i>You know what?</i>

50:22.978 --> 50:24.938
<i>Fuck you, man.</i>

50:24.980 --> 50:26.773
<i>My dad...</i>

50:26.815 --> 50:29.317
<i>he is gonna</i> <i>destroy</i> <i>you!</i>

50:29.359 --> 50:30.944
<i>He knows everybody in this town.</i>

50:30.986 --> 50:33.113
<i>They love him.
They would do anything for him.</i>

50:33.155 --> 50:34.948
<i>And when he finds out
what you did to me,</i>

50:34.990 --> 50:37.034
<i>he is gonna find you</i>

50:37.075 --> 50:40.495
<i>and he is gonna rain down</i>

50:40.537 --> 50:42.873
<i>a world of pain on you, man!</i>

50:42.914 --> 50:45.876
<i>You have no idea
what you're doing!</i>

50:45.917 --> 50:47.919
<i>Like you said...</i>

50:47.961 --> 50:49.713
<i>life is short...</i>

50:49.755 --> 50:50.714
<i>dude.</i>

50:50.756 --> 50:52.215
<i></i>

51:06.021 --> 51:08.023
<i>Tonight's the night.</i>

51:08.065 --> 51:10.734
<i>pulsing, tense music</i>

51:11.902 --> 51:13.737
<i>Hello, Dexter Morgan.</i>

51:22.788 --> 51:24.247
<i>-Hey, you.
-[Angela]</i> <i>I thought</i>

51:24.289 --> 51:26.083
<i>you were coming
to the Christmas Tree Festival.</i>

51:26.124 --> 51:28.335
<i>Fox got in the henhouse.</i>

51:28.376 --> 51:30.712
<i>It's kind of a mess here.</i>

51:30.754 --> 51:32.714
<i>-Oh. Sorry.</i>

51:32.756 --> 51:35.425
<i>Well... we'll miss you.</i>

51:36.301 --> 51:37.844
<i>See you tomorrow?</i>

51:37.886 --> 51:38.845
<i>You bet.</i>

51:38.887 --> 51:40.430
<i>Can't wait.</i>

51:43.100 --> 51:44.893
<i>So...</i>

51:44.935 --> 51:46.103
<i>no Jim.</i>

51:46.144 --> 51:47.938
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

51:49.439 --> 51:51.525
<i>I don't need trophies anymore.</i>

51:53.026 --> 51:55.946
<i>I may be a monster,
but I'm an evolving monster.</i>

51:55.987 --> 51:58.949
<i>God rest ye merry gentlemen</i>

51:58.990 --> 52:01.660
<i>- Let nothing you dismay</i>
<i></i>

52:01.701 --> 52:03.078
<i>Remember Christ</i>

52:03.120 --> 52:05.205
<i>What to do with you?</i>

52:05.247 --> 52:08.041
<i>- Was born on Christmas Day</i>
<i></i>

52:08.083 --> 52:09.042
<i>To save us all</i>

52:09.084 --> 52:11.503
<i>Not exactly Miami Bay,</i>

52:11.545 --> 52:13.088
<i>but it does have a hole in it.</i>

52:13.130 --> 52:15.507
<i>- Gone astray, oh</i>
<i></i>

52:15.549 --> 52:18.885
<i>Tidings of comfort and joy</i>

52:18.927 --> 52:20.387
<i>Comfort and joy</i>

52:20.428 --> 52:22.430
<i>Oh, tidings</i>

52:22.472 --> 52:25.142
<i>Of comfort and joy</i>

52:25.183 --> 52:27.144
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

52:28.186 --> 52:30.647
<i>Not listening to you.</i>

52:30.689 --> 52:32.315
<i>- All you within</i>
<i></i>

52:32.357 --> 52:33.984
<i>This place</i>

52:34.025 --> 52:36.403
<i>And with true love
and brotherhood</i>

52:36.444 --> 52:40.073
<i>Each other now embrace</i>

52:40.115 --> 52:42.742
<i>This holy tide of Christmas</i>

52:42.784 --> 52:44.161
<i>Doth bring</i>

52:44.202 --> 52:46.413
<i>My life has always been...</i>

52:46.454 --> 52:48.248
<i>truth-adjacent.</i>

52:48.290 --> 52:50.333
<i>Of comfort and joy</i>

52:50.375 --> 52:52.544
<i>But, starting now,
there will be one less lie.</i>

52:52.586 --> 52:55.672
<i>Oh, tidings of comfort</i>

52:55.714 --> 52:57.299
<i>And joy</i>

53:03.722 --> 53:05.599
<i>That's nice.</i>

53:05.640 --> 53:06.766
<i>Got the tickets?
Here,</i>

53:06.808 --> 53:08.268
<i>-I got them.
- Yeah.</i>

53:08.310 --> 53:10.478
<i>We make a stop in Albany, right?</i>

53:10.520 --> 53:12.981
<i>Uh, yeah, yeah.</i>

53:13.023 --> 53:14.191
<i>Yeah.</i>

53:14.232 --> 53:16.359
<i>-Go ahead.
No, no.</i>

53:17.777 --> 53:19.738
<i>gentle, somber music</i>

53:24.201 --> 53:26.620
<i>I thought you might need this.</i>

53:40.175 --> 53:41.968
<i>You know, after Miami...</i>

53:45.931 --> 53:48.642
<i>...could never get used
to this damn cold.</i>

53:59.736 --> 54:01.905
<i>I thought you didn't know me.</i>

54:07.035 --> 54:09.621
<i>You were right.</i>

54:12.499 --> 54:14.751
<i>I'm Dexter Morgan.</i>

54:18.797 --> 54:20.590
<i>Your father.</i>

54:24.511 --> 54:26.805
<i>Come home.</i>

54:31.142 --> 54:33.019
<i>Please.</i>

55:18.606 --> 55:21.234
<i>My father protected me.</i>

55:21.276 --> 55:23.153
<i>Taught me.</i>

55:23.194 --> 55:25.447
<i>Kept me alive.</i>

55:26.072 --> 55:29.868
<i>And that's exactly what
I'm going to do for my son.</i>

55:31.036 --> 55:32.996
<i>low, ominous music</i>

55:52.515 --> 55:54.976
<i>slow, somber music</i>
