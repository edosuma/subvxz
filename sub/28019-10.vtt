00:14.458 --> 00:17.417
Aw. There we go.

00:43.095 --> 00:44.444
Kay, come join us.

00:48.317 --> 00:49.318
Oi!

00:49.362 --> 00:50.885
Kay! There she is.

00:50.929 --> 00:52.583
Let's party.

00:53.845 --> 00:55.803
Hey. I just got him to sleep.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.109
I thought this was a party.

00:57.152 --> 00:59.633
It is, but I just spent ten days
sleep training,

00:59.677 --> 01:01.548
so unless you want to ruin the night,

01:01.592 --> 01:02.897
listen to a screaming baby, keep it down.

01:02.941 --> 01:06.115
Come on, Mummy.

01:06.158 --> 01:07.811
You remember this one.

01:13.038 --> 01:15.388
Uh-huh.

01:24.745 --> 01:25.964
Shh.

01:33.885 --> 01:35.843
Like old times, right, Kaylee?

01:35.887 --> 01:37.715
I have missed this.

01:43.285 --> 01:45.026
Did somebody spike my drink?

01:45.070 --> 01:47.202
Oh, come on, Kay.

01:47.246 --> 01:48.377
The booze was never your problem.

01:48.421 --> 01:49.596
Didn't put smack in it,

01:49.640 --> 01:52.120
did I? Yeah, it's all a problem
for me, Bri.

01:52.164 --> 01:54.514
In my support group, we say
alcohol is a drug, full stop.

01:54.558 --> 01:56.690
Well, I think you're boring, full stop.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.476
No, I'm not fighting with you.

01:59.519 --> 02:01.173
If you want to drink, fine. Just
don't make it harder for me.

02:01.216 --> 02:03.523
Oh, do you know I'd
give 100 quid for the old Kay?

02:03.567 --> 02:05.786
Right here, right now. This new one's

02:05.830 --> 02:07.962
a total prat.

02:08.006 --> 02:11.051
All right, out. Both you now.

02:11.096 --> 02:12.902
Whatever.

02:14.285 --> 02:15.883
Sorry.

02:26.971 --> 02:28.859
Finn? Finn!

02:45.401 --> 02:46.615
It was really great.

02:46.659 --> 02:48.617
I hope you, you know,
get something from it.

02:48.661 --> 02:50.619
- I am glad it was...
- Thank you.

02:50.663 --> 02:52.839
- Take care. Thank you.
- Thank you. Hey. Thanks.

02:52.883 --> 02:54.319
Thanks very much.

02:54.362 --> 02:55.711
Laura, hey.

02:55.755 --> 02:58.845
Oliver Yates.
That was a great presentation.

02:58.889 --> 03:00.673
Well, thank you.
We're always happy to share

03:00.716 --> 03:03.730
what we know with other negotiators.
Good, good question.

03:03.773 --> 03:05.330
- Uh, Eric.
- Yeah.

03:05.373 --> 03:07.506
This is Laura Watson,

03:07.549 --> 03:09.421
founder of Extreme Risk Management.

03:09.464 --> 03:10.596
I have heard

03:10.639 --> 03:12.119
only good things. Other than the fact

03:12.163 --> 03:14.078
that you tried to poach one
of my best people, of course.

03:14.121 --> 03:15.340
Well, offer still stands.

03:16.471 --> 03:18.996
- Yeah, so does my answer.
- That's right.

03:19.039 --> 03:21.999
Well, then, I guess we'll
just say good-bye... again.

03:24.044 --> 03:27.743
Remind me why I chose to stay with you?

03:27.787 --> 03:30.398
I guess you're just a less-
pay-for-more-work kind of guy.

03:30.442 --> 03:31.791
Stop.

03:31.835 --> 03:33.619
- Stop!
- Get off me.

03:33.662 --> 03:35.055
Let go of my arm.

03:35.099 --> 03:38.145
E-Eric Beaumont, I need your help.

03:38.189 --> 03:39.625
Uh, I'm sorry.

03:39.668 --> 03:40.972
- Do we...?
- Yeah, he's gonna be sorry

03:41.015 --> 03:42.276
if he doesn't let go of me.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.411
It's okay. Thank you.

03:44.179 --> 03:46.110
Uh, what can I do for you, Miss...?

03:46.153 --> 03:47.633
Hobbs. Uh, Kaylee Hobbs.

03:47.676 --> 03:50.679
Look, I'm really sorry
for barging in like this.

03:50.723 --> 03:53.160
It's just, I saw on the news
about this conference,

03:53.204 --> 03:55.119
and they said you were the best
there is at getting people back.

03:55.162 --> 03:58.122
"Back"? Who's been taken?

03:58.641 --> 04:00.385
Someone took my son.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.302
This was left in his crib.

04:04.345 --> 04:05.825
I know this MO.

04:05.869 --> 04:08.828
He goes by the name Sandman.
Repeat offender.

04:08.872 --> 04:11.744
He specializes in kidnapping babies.

04:11.787 --> 04:13.093
Did you pay the ransom?

04:13.137 --> 04:14.529
We tried.

04:14.573 --> 04:16.401
They had to fake it
since I didn't have the money.

04:16.444 --> 04:18.375
Police, uh, thought they could catch him,

04:18.420 --> 04:19.949
but he never showed.

04:20.579 --> 04:22.363
That was six weeks ago.

04:22.846 --> 04:24.844
Now they're saying I should be
prepared for the worst.

04:24.888 --> 04:26.367
Has he made contact since?

04:26.411 --> 04:27.934
- No.
- Hmm.

04:28.979 --> 04:30.589
Kaylee, here's the thing.

04:30.632 --> 04:32.156
We're-we're not investigators.

04:32.199 --> 04:34.549
We're negotiators. If the
police are handling the case,

04:34.593 --> 04:35.986
I'm sure they're doing
everything they can

04:36.029 --> 04:37.422
to try and make contact
with the kidnapper.

04:37.465 --> 04:40.032
But they're not. They're giving up.

04:40.555 --> 04:42.079
- You think I can't pay you?
- We promise

04:42.122 --> 04:43.602
that's not it.

04:43.645 --> 04:45.691
- If I thought we could help, we would.
- Yeah.

04:47.991 --> 04:49.303
You have kids, Mr. Beaumont?

04:50.348 --> 04:51.523
Yeah.

04:51.566 --> 04:53.655
What would you do if it was yours?

04:53.699 --> 04:55.788
Would you fight till your last breath?

04:55.831 --> 04:57.877
Would you ever give up?

05:21.859 --> 05:24.383
Client's name is Kaylee Hobbs.

05:24.427 --> 05:27.865
19, single mom, former addict.

05:27.909 --> 05:29.301
Baby's father?

05:29.345 --> 05:31.390
Overdosed.

05:32.870 --> 05:35.481
I lived in a place like this
after my parents died.

05:35.525 --> 05:36.787
You said a neighbor

05:36.831 --> 05:38.093
was with Kaylee the night
of the kidnapping?

05:38.136 --> 05:40.704
Yeah, um, her friend Brianne. She lives

05:40.748 --> 05:42.010
in number 19.

05:42.452 --> 05:44.055
- Let's start there?
- Yeah.

05:49.191 --> 05:50.714
And this window was locked?

05:50.758 --> 05:53.021
Yeah. Police said the, uh, Sandman

05:53.064 --> 05:54.849
uses special tools, like a cat burglar.

05:55.650 --> 05:57.739
- Didn't even leave a mark.
- Or a fingerprint.

05:58.113 --> 06:01.246
Yeah, and you found the card right here?

06:01.290 --> 06:03.509
Card left was a Moon tarot.

06:03.553 --> 06:06.251
Every report says the Sandman
leaves the King of Cups.

06:06.295 --> 06:09.167
Yeah, police held that back.
Said it was a way to be certain

06:09.211 --> 06:10.386
they were dealing with the real kidnapper

06:10.429 --> 06:11.779
and not a scammer.

06:11.822 --> 06:13.432
You know, kidnappers tend
to favor taking victims

06:13.476 --> 06:14.869
whose families are wealthy, and...

06:15.659 --> 06:19.300
Any idea why the Sandman might
think that you had Â£20,000 to spare?

06:22.267 --> 06:24.530
I won 5,000 quid

06:24.574 --> 06:27.098
on a scratch card a while back.

06:28.053 --> 06:30.101
People around here started
talking like I won millions.

06:30.145 --> 06:32.408
Was this on the night of the kidnapping?

06:32.851 --> 06:34.062
Yeah.

06:35.136 --> 06:37.051
For all the good it did me.

06:38.022 --> 06:39.981
It's got an SD card inside.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.460
It takes a photo every second,

06:41.504 --> 06:43.898
but kidnapper was wearing a mask.

06:43.941 --> 06:46.074
- Police couldn't identify him.
- Okay, I'd like to see those pictures.

06:46.748 --> 06:48.554
They're right there in the report.

06:49.251 --> 06:51.470
You know, we should speak to the police.

06:51.514 --> 06:53.037
Um, do you have a number
for the lead investigator?

06:53.081 --> 06:56.084
Yeah. I'll get my phone.

07:06.556 --> 07:07.878
She came over the day after

07:07.922 --> 07:10.011
Finn disappeared,
saying I distracted her.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.056
Saying I'm the reason it happened.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.362
Why would she say that?

07:14.940 --> 07:16.974
She needed someone to blame.

07:18.060 --> 07:19.585
She's always looking
for someone to blame.

07:19.629 --> 07:21.674
Drinking, drugs...
none of it's her fault.

07:21.718 --> 07:23.676
We just want to know
what you saw that night.

07:24.108 --> 07:25.983
Miss High and Mighty
kicking me and my mate out

07:26.027 --> 07:27.506
for trying to have a good time.
That's what I saw.

07:27.550 --> 07:28.681
You would have been

07:28.725 --> 07:29.726
walking home at the same time

07:29.769 --> 07:30.901
the kidnapper was escaping

07:30.952 --> 07:32.040
- with Finn.
- I've been over this

07:32.076 --> 07:33.773
with the cops. I didn't see nothing.

07:33.817 --> 07:34.905
Whatever your issues are

07:34.949 --> 07:37.168
with Kaylee, she was once your friend.

07:37.212 --> 07:41.346
And right now she is a mother
who is terrified for her child.

07:41.390 --> 07:43.914
So, look, I'm gonna leave you my card

07:43.958 --> 07:46.782
and hope that if you can think
of anything, you'll call.

07:49.093 --> 07:51.269
Did this poor, suffering mother tell you

07:51.313 --> 07:52.705
that she was gonna sell that baby?

07:53.341 --> 07:54.577
Excuse me?

07:54.620 --> 07:55.839
Didn't think the angel Kaylee

07:55.883 --> 07:57.449
would have told you that.

07:59.451 --> 08:02.235
I was an 18-year-old smack addict

08:02.278 --> 08:04.804
with no family and 20 quid in my pocket.

08:04.848 --> 08:06.806
Of course I thought
about not keeping him.

08:06.850 --> 08:08.156
I understand why you didn't tell anyone,

08:08.199 --> 08:09.809
and we're not here to judge you.

08:09.853 --> 08:12.769
But it is important
that you do tell us everything.

08:12.812 --> 08:13.901
It's not like I got pregnant

08:13.944 --> 08:16.207
because I wanted to make some quick cash.

08:16.251 --> 08:18.253
I didn't know what I wanted.

08:18.296 --> 08:20.255
I heard there were people
who pay for babies.

08:20.298 --> 08:22.387
I thought about it for half a second.

08:22.431 --> 08:24.955
This is

08:24.999 --> 08:26.739
the London social housing authority.

08:26.783 --> 08:29.133
I told you to leave me alone!

08:29.177 --> 08:30.613
- Get out of here!
- Miss Hobbs,

08:30.656 --> 08:32.222
I have your final notice in hand.

08:32.267 --> 08:34.182
The bailiffs will be coming

08:34.225 --> 08:35.807
- in six hours.
- Bastards.

08:35.851 --> 08:38.534
- You are not coming in here!
- Let me handle this.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.715
Cynthia Walker, solicitor.

08:45.758 --> 08:47.108
You're her lawyer?

08:47.151 --> 08:48.326
I'm a lawyer.

08:48.370 --> 08:49.632
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

08:49.675 --> 08:52.401
Deena Hazari,
London social housing authority,

08:52.445 --> 08:53.566
district manager.

08:53.609 --> 08:55.333
There have been multiple
hearings in this matter,

08:55.377 --> 08:57.857
many chances for Kaylee
to plead her case in court,

08:57.901 --> 08:59.947
but she hasn't even seen fit
to turn up to them.

08:59.990 --> 09:01.426
What matter are we talking about?

09:01.470 --> 09:03.037
Kaylee Hobbs is being evicted.

09:03.080 --> 09:05.430
Evicted? What for?

09:06.434 --> 09:08.042
I cannot condone violence.

09:08.085 --> 09:10.044
That girl is her own worst enemy.

09:13.802 --> 09:16.276
It wasn't like it sounds.

09:16.320 --> 09:18.015
Finn was missing a few weeks.

09:18.059 --> 09:19.898
They sent around some man
with a clipboard

09:19.942 --> 09:21.160
asking all kinds of questions

09:21.203 --> 09:23.269
about noise and the way I live.

09:24.141 --> 09:25.403
Told him to get out.

09:25.428 --> 09:27.147
Tried to slam the door. Caught his arm.

09:27.172 --> 09:28.804
You're leaving out the foul language

09:28.829 --> 09:30.201
and the threats you made.

09:30.226 --> 09:32.335
Do you know what happens if
you kick us out of this place?

09:32.360 --> 09:34.530
Social services said if I can't
provide a safe environment

09:34.555 --> 09:37.117
for Finn, they're gonna take him away.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.380
I can't get him back

09:38.424 --> 09:39.903
just to lose him all over again.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.905
You must know
the mitigating circumstances.

09:43.951 --> 09:45.561
I know she's lost her child.

09:45.605 --> 09:47.389
Kaylee's child isn't gone forever.

09:47.433 --> 09:48.695
We are working to get him back.

09:48.738 --> 09:50.859
I feel for her. I do.

09:50.860 --> 09:52.253
And I wish I could help.

09:52.297 --> 09:53.820
But our nonviolence policy is...

09:53.863 --> 09:56.170
You kick us out,
get Finn taken away from me,

09:56.214 --> 09:57.563
see how much I care
about your nonviolence policy.

09:57.606 --> 09:59.869
All right, all right. Let's go inside.

10:02.524 --> 10:05.527
I don't know why she needs negotiators.

10:05.571 --> 10:08.206
I've got five men on this case.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.414
I think she was concerned that
your people might be giving up.

10:10.439 --> 10:13.224
You, uh, you told her
to prepare for the worst?

10:13.249 --> 10:16.307
I did. But how she got
from that to giving up...

10:20.281 --> 10:21.674
Given that you're not family,

10:21.717 --> 10:24.140
I'm not required to provide you
with any information.

10:25.086 --> 10:26.771
No, of course. No, we understand.

10:26.814 --> 10:29.251
We're just hoping you can
answer a few questions.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.167
Kaylee said you set up a ransom exchange,

10:32.211 --> 10:34.300
but the kidnapper didn't show.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.868
Is that something that the
Sandman has done before?

10:36.911 --> 10:38.434
No. We thought we'd have him.

10:38.478 --> 10:40.175
We had the whole site covered.

10:40.219 --> 10:41.437
Uh, is it possible he never showed

10:41.481 --> 10:42.656
because he spotted your people?

10:42.700 --> 10:44.266
My people are well-trained officers

10:44.310 --> 10:46.660
who were outside long before
Sandman was supposed to show.

10:46.704 --> 10:48.183
Yeah, I didn't mean to suggest otherwise.

10:48.227 --> 10:49.315
What do you think happened?

10:50.000 --> 10:52.100
I've worked council estates

10:52.144 --> 10:53.536
since I was a constable.

10:53.580 --> 10:55.321
The number of overdoses alone was enough

10:55.364 --> 10:56.801
to break your heart,
but then there's the babies.

10:56.844 --> 10:58.019
Clinging to life

10:58.063 --> 10:59.325
because of mothers
who couldn't stay clean

10:59.368 --> 11:00.674
when they were pregnant.

11:00.718 --> 11:02.241
Poor lungs, prone to seizures.

11:02.284 --> 11:04.112
If you ask me,

11:04.156 --> 11:05.172
Sandman didn't show

11:05.215 --> 11:07.289
because he didn't have a baby
to bring back.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.248
I think Finn Hobbs died

11:09.291 --> 11:12.512
because he was too weak
and sick to survive.

11:12.555 --> 11:13.861
Do you still have
the number that you used

11:13.905 --> 11:15.471
- to contact Sandman?
- We do.

11:15.515 --> 11:16.864
Okay.

11:16.908 --> 11:18.649
But it's disconnected.

11:18.692 --> 11:20.476
He's long gone.

11:23.523 --> 11:25.743
We need to find a way to get
in touch with the Sandman.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.441
Well, what about another negotiator?

11:28.484 --> 11:30.486
There's been 11 Sandman kidnappings.

11:30.530 --> 11:32.314
Someone's got to have used one.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.186
11, huh?

11:34.229 --> 11:36.275
Well, Laura Watson's
company has negotiated

11:36.318 --> 11:38.538
most of the big K&Rs in the
U.K. in the past ten years.

11:38.581 --> 11:40.671
Okay, well, odds are good that
she's dealt with him before.

11:40.714 --> 11:43.499
Yeah. Might be able to tell us
how she communicated with him.

11:43.543 --> 11:45.763
- Thank you.
- The only problem is

11:45.806 --> 11:47.373
we would never give up
confidential information

11:47.416 --> 11:48.940
about someone we've negotiated with.

11:48.983 --> 11:50.115
Neither will she.

11:50.158 --> 11:52.499
Have to figure out something she wants.

11:53.367 --> 11:55.773
- Other than you.
- Anything Laura wants

11:55.816 --> 11:59.385
and is gonna ask for,
I'm not gonna want to give her.

11:59.428 --> 12:01.822
That's a lot to ask,

12:01.866 --> 12:03.258
Mr. Beaumont.

12:03.302 --> 12:05.696
Confidentiality is the
key to our business.

12:05.739 --> 12:06.958
We understand that,

12:07.001 --> 12:09.264
but there is a baby's life at stake here.

12:11.785 --> 12:13.791
You're dating an FBI agent, correct?

12:16.555 --> 12:18.621
You know, private
negotiation is a small world.

12:18.665 --> 12:20.186
People talk.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.976
What does my personal life
have to do with anything?

12:25.514 --> 12:28.314
I might have a way
to contact the Sandman.

12:28.806 --> 12:30.285
But in return, I need

12:30.329 --> 12:32.070
information from the FBI.

12:32.113 --> 12:35.421
I recently hired a former FBI profiler.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.944
Soon after he joined us,

12:36.988 --> 12:38.990
someone breached my office firewall

12:39.033 --> 12:40.774
and accessed confidential information.

12:40.818 --> 12:42.451
You're trying to decide
if you can trust him.

12:42.476 --> 12:44.517
I want to know if his leaving the FBI was

12:44.560 --> 12:46.780
a "quit before you can be fired"
situation.

12:46.824 --> 12:48.303
You're asking a lot.

12:48.347 --> 12:49.783
You're asking me
to betray the core principle

12:49.827 --> 12:51.350
of what we do.

12:51.393 --> 12:52.655
Do we have a deal?

12:55.789 --> 12:57.878
Give us a minute.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.451
Okay, you don't have to do this.

13:05.494 --> 13:07.453
We can figure out another way

13:07.496 --> 13:09.281
- to contact the Sandman.
- Such as?

13:09.324 --> 13:12.729
You think we can't all see
that you're happier

13:12.773 --> 13:14.590
since you've been with Kate?

13:14.634 --> 13:16.951
No one would ever ask you to risk that.

13:18.220 --> 13:19.944
Kaylee would.

13:31.694 --> 13:33.392
Hey, Beaumont.

13:33.435 --> 13:34.828
Pick a restaurant for Friday?

13:34.872 --> 13:36.134
I did.

13:36.177 --> 13:39.137
I found a place
with a $100 steak on the menu.

13:39.180 --> 13:41.269
I'm thinking two ribeyes.

13:41.313 --> 13:43.402
And whatever you're having, of course.

13:45.230 --> 13:47.996
You know, actually, I'm calling
because I need a favor.

13:48.039 --> 13:49.712
I need the personnel records

13:49.756 --> 13:51.671
of a former profiler at the Bureau.

13:51.714 --> 13:54.805
You want me to access
confidential records

13:54.848 --> 13:57.329
and hand them over to a civilian?

13:57.372 --> 13:59.331
Listen, I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

13:59.374 --> 14:00.723
I hope not.

14:00.767 --> 14:02.943
Since you'd be putting my career
on the line.

14:02.987 --> 14:04.423
Again.

14:04.466 --> 14:07.776
I know. And I understand.

14:08.251 --> 14:09.904
Why do you need them?

14:10.516 --> 14:12.387
All I can say is if I trade those records

14:12.431 --> 14:13.824
for information, it might help me

14:13.867 --> 14:15.826
bring a kidnapped baby home
to his mother.

14:18.169 --> 14:20.482
Send me the name.
You'll have it in an hour.

14:20.526 --> 14:21.657
Thank you.

14:21.701 --> 14:23.024
Thank...

14:28.198 --> 14:29.491
As I said, Miss Hobbs

14:29.535 --> 14:31.885
wasn't in any state of mind
to answer those notices.

14:31.929 --> 14:33.974
And an appeal would...

14:34.018 --> 14:35.454
Thank you.

14:35.497 --> 14:37.804
I appreciate you making the time.

14:42.336 --> 14:43.941
I have news on your flat.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.551
- What?
- Deena Hazari,

14:45.594 --> 14:46.857
the woman who was here earlier,

14:46.900 --> 14:48.380
she's agreed to speak with you.

14:48.423 --> 14:50.623
It's nothing formal,
but we can go down to her office

14:50.667 --> 14:52.906
- for mediation.
- That's like a negotiation?

14:52.950 --> 14:55.343
- Yes.
- Brilliant. You can handle it, then.

14:55.387 --> 14:58.085
I can advise you. But it's up to you

14:58.129 --> 15:00.914
to convince them on your own
to let you stay.

15:00.958 --> 15:03.351
If I screw up, I'll lose my flat,

15:03.395 --> 15:05.305
- and they'll take Finn away.
- You can do it.

15:05.349 --> 15:07.138
You just have to keep
your head on straight.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.285
Hey.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.275
- Anything?
- Yeah.

15:14.319 --> 15:16.538
Another negotiator gave us
the Sandman's real name.

15:16.582 --> 15:19.019
- You're joking.
- No, no. She had proof

15:19.063 --> 15:20.847
of his identity, but, uh...

15:20.891 --> 15:22.762
there's something that she didn't know.

15:22.805 --> 15:24.242
We just looked him up.

15:24.285 --> 15:26.722
First thing we found was an obituary

15:27.017 --> 15:28.506
from eight months ago.

15:28.550 --> 15:32.293
Sandman was dead before Finn was taken.

15:32.337 --> 15:34.165
He's not the kidnapper.

15:35.209 --> 15:37.342
If it wasn't the Sandman,
then who the hell took Finn?

15:45.721 --> 15:48.724
Says here he died of natural causes.

15:53.990 --> 15:55.339
I don't understand.

15:55.383 --> 15:57.298
Why would some kidnapper pretend
to be the Sandman?

15:57.341 --> 15:59.692
Maybe to lead the police
down the wrong path.

15:59.735 --> 16:01.607
Given the subterfuge
and the fact that the kidnapper

16:01.650 --> 16:03.739
never tried to get the ransom,
it's-it's possible

16:03.783 --> 16:06.305
that we're actually looking
at an abduction.

16:08.309 --> 16:09.963
What's the difference?

16:10.006 --> 16:12.922
Well, a kidnapper makes a demand
in exchange for the victim.

16:12.966 --> 16:14.489
In an abduction,

16:14.533 --> 16:16.143
there's no intention of giving them back.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.102
Kaylee, you said you heard

16:19.146 --> 16:21.278
you could sell your
baby? Who told you that?

16:22.060 --> 16:25.195
Uh, a man from my narcotic
support group meetings.

16:25.239 --> 16:27.720
Another addict. He, uh, was nice to me.

16:27.763 --> 16:30.549
Drove me to the doctors.
Got me prenatal vitamins.

16:30.592 --> 16:33.856
Said there was people
willing to pay to adopt a baby,

16:33.900 --> 16:36.032
the kind that could
give Finn a better life.

16:36.076 --> 16:37.381
Do you know the man's name?

16:37.425 --> 16:38.731
Benjamin something?

16:38.774 --> 16:40.515
Uh... Barnes.

16:40.559 --> 16:42.647
I think he's worth looking into.

16:42.690 --> 16:44.432
The kidnapper was able to match

16:44.476 --> 16:46.173
the handwriting on the tarot cards

16:46.216 --> 16:47.522
with the Sandman's.

16:47.566 --> 16:48.915
That suggests someone had access

16:48.958 --> 16:50.307
to confidential case information.

16:50.351 --> 16:52.396
Zara, you come with me.

16:52.440 --> 16:53.659
We'll look into Benjamin Barnes.

16:53.702 --> 16:55.356
Oliver, Cynthia,

16:55.399 --> 16:57.401
go back to DCI Turner.

16:57.445 --> 16:58.707
See if you can, uh,

16:58.751 --> 17:00.729
find out who had access
to the case files.

17:02.232 --> 17:03.756
Kaylee,

17:04.380 --> 17:06.146
focus on the mediation.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.628
What do I do?

17:07.673 --> 17:08.891
Think of three good reasons

17:08.935 --> 17:10.240
why you deserve to stay here.

17:19.031 --> 17:20.946
Those the images from the baby monitor?

17:20.990 --> 17:22.165
Mm-hmm.

17:23.493 --> 17:24.800
Hey.

17:27.867 --> 17:30.652
He said you have new information
about Finn Hobbs.

17:30.696 --> 17:34.221
We have proof that Sandman
wasn't the kidnapper.

17:34.264 --> 17:36.571
- What's this?
- Sandman's real identity.

17:36.615 --> 17:38.878
Another negotiating firm had his name.

17:38.921 --> 17:41.117
We looked him up, and he died.

17:41.160 --> 17:42.925
Eight months ago.

17:42.969 --> 17:44.579
I'll need to contact Scotland Yard.

17:44.623 --> 17:47.495
They'll need to confirm it.
But if it is true,

17:47.520 --> 17:49.285
it'll answer a lot of questions.

17:49.348 --> 17:50.939
Well, there's only so many people

17:50.982 --> 17:52.805
who can convincingly fake
a Sandman kidnapping.

17:52.848 --> 17:55.459
You kept images of the tarot
cards out of the press.

17:55.503 --> 17:56.678
No one knew the handwriting.

17:57.337 --> 18:00.552
So that leaves the families and us.

18:00.595 --> 18:01.983
The police.

18:02.026 --> 18:04.686
If you can gather a list of every officer

18:04.730 --> 18:06.732
who had access to Sandman files,

18:06.775 --> 18:08.516
we can help you identify any suspects...

18:08.560 --> 18:09.618
I can't do that.

18:09.662 --> 18:10.909
You're suggesting

18:10.953 --> 18:12.289
that police officers may be involved

18:12.333 --> 18:14.043
in a major kidnapping case.

18:14.087 --> 18:15.697
It's an internal affairs matter.

18:15.741 --> 18:17.394
Can you at least keep us in the loop?

18:17.438 --> 18:20.385
When I have something more concrete, yes.

18:21.268 --> 18:23.444
But I'm not gonna spread suppositions.

18:33.062 --> 18:35.021
This is the place.

18:35.064 --> 18:36.457
The man who suggested

18:36.500 --> 18:38.024
Kaylee should give up her baby for money

18:38.067 --> 18:40.069
- lives here with his wife.
- Well, not for long.

18:40.113 --> 18:41.617
House is for sale.

18:42.398 --> 18:44.944
If they do have Finn, we
can't risk tipping them off.

18:44.987 --> 18:46.721
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

18:57.304 --> 18:59.045
This is a beautiful space.

18:59.088 --> 19:00.742
And I love

19:00.786 --> 19:02.091
everything you've done with it.

19:02.135 --> 19:03.702
It's...

19:03.745 --> 19:07.183
it's exactly what I've been looking for.

19:07.227 --> 19:10.186
Now if I could just convince my husband.

19:11.535 --> 19:12.972
Have you been here a long time?

19:13.015 --> 19:15.496
Uh, m-more than ten years.

19:15.539 --> 19:16.758
We love it around here.

19:16.802 --> 19:18.934
Everything's nearby. Shops, parks.

19:18.978 --> 19:21.241
There's a pool just up the street.

19:21.284 --> 19:22.851
Schools around here are some of the best.

19:22.895 --> 19:25.027
It all drew us to the area originally.

19:25.071 --> 19:26.855
Do you have kids?

19:26.899 --> 19:28.770
No, it's just Ben and I.

19:30.096 --> 19:31.817
- Hi. Benjamin Barnes.
- Hey.

19:31.860 --> 19:33.296
- Pleased to meet you.
- Hi.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.211
This house was meant for a big family.

19:35.255 --> 19:37.213
- You said you have three children?
- Mm-hmm.

19:37.257 --> 19:38.998
There's three bedrooms
upstairs, two down,

19:39.041 --> 19:40.564
so they could each have their own.

19:40.608 --> 19:43.524
Please feel free to look around.
Make yourselves at home.

19:44.320 --> 19:46.179
None of those come with the house,

19:46.222 --> 19:47.528
I'm afraid.

19:47.884 --> 19:49.486
You're in the military.

19:49.931 --> 19:52.402
Two tours in Afghanistan,
but that's done.

19:53.257 --> 19:54.927
Civilian life for me.

19:55.244 --> 19:56.406
You miss it?

19:56.450 --> 19:57.843
Parts of it, yes.

19:57.886 --> 19:59.714
People I served with. The ones we lost.

19:59.758 --> 20:01.368
Oh, brothers in arms, right?

20:02.169 --> 20:03.544
Exactly.

20:03.587 --> 20:05.241
Benjamin, I'm sure these busy people

20:05.285 --> 20:08.201
don't want to hear your war stories.

20:08.244 --> 20:09.942
Why don't we show you
the rest of the house?

20:09.985 --> 20:12.727
- Okay, yeah. Fantastic.
- Would you like

20:12.771 --> 20:14.477
- to see the upstairs?
- Hey, babe.

20:15.643 --> 20:16.818
It's nice, right?

20:16.862 --> 20:18.621
Very nice. It's very nice.

20:20.561 --> 20:23.085
I have three points I'd like to make.

20:27.510 --> 20:28.806
One:

20:30.390 --> 20:33.095
I was struggling

20:33.558 --> 20:35.638
with the kidnapping of my son.

20:36.662 --> 20:39.232
And I wasn't, uh, thinking clearly

20:39.624 --> 20:41.103
when your bloke

20:41.147 --> 20:43.236
- came and...
- Our maintenance supervisor.

20:44.237 --> 20:45.842
Yeah, him.

20:46.543 --> 20:49.546
When I, uh, closed the door

20:49.590 --> 20:51.138
on his arm.

20:52.226 --> 20:56.292
I would never consciously choose
to hurt anyone.

20:57.121 --> 20:58.817
I appreciate that.

21:02.491 --> 21:03.816
Two...

21:06.694 --> 21:09.305
I-I never had anyone, uh...

21:09.349 --> 21:11.032
looking out for me

21:11.076 --> 21:13.746
when I was growing up, so...

21:14.702 --> 21:17.270
I-I'm trying to change...

21:17.724 --> 21:19.900
but it takes time.

21:21.753 --> 21:23.798
And three...

21:28.977 --> 21:31.284
I'm doing everything I can...

21:31.327 --> 21:33.024
to get my son back.

21:34.156 --> 21:35.647
But if you kick me out...

21:36.332 --> 21:38.682
it'll all be for nothing. I'll lose him.

21:38.726 --> 21:40.492
Miss Hobbs,

21:40.535 --> 21:43.209
we have to be conscious
of the fitness of our residents.

21:43.252 --> 21:45.298
- You think I'm unfit?
- Kaylee...

21:45.341 --> 21:47.126
Look, I was never convicted of anything.

21:47.591 --> 21:49.432
There were several noise complaints.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.558
Yeah, of course there was noise.
I had a baby.

21:52.522 --> 21:54.524
I ha-have a baby.

22:00.280 --> 22:01.629
Do you know what this is?

22:02.882 --> 22:04.099
It's a medallion

22:04.143 --> 22:06.319
that I got for being one year sober.

22:07.418 --> 22:08.592
One year.

22:09.542 --> 22:11.544
365 days.

22:13.031 --> 22:15.816
I did it for my son. He's all I have.

22:15.841 --> 22:17.538
I understand you've been through a lot.

22:17.563 --> 22:20.784
You-you think...
you think you can understand?

22:22.683 --> 22:23.684
Kaylee...

22:23.727 --> 22:25.729
No. Uh...

22:25.773 --> 22:27.819
Forget it. I'm done.

22:29.028 --> 22:30.517
You think she's even listening?

22:31.828 --> 22:33.302
You think she's not

22:33.346 --> 22:34.889
sitting there, having
fun, looking down on me?

22:34.914 --> 22:38.742
Believe me, Miss Hobbs,
there's nothing fun about trying to

22:38.767 --> 22:41.387
anticipate the future actions
of a young woman

22:41.412 --> 22:42.587
with a history of drug offenses.

22:51.190 --> 22:53.670
- How'd it go?
- There was no sign of a baby

22:53.714 --> 22:54.933
in that house.

22:54.976 --> 22:56.456
Anything on your end?

22:56.499 --> 22:59.067
Well, I've been going over
the pictures on the baby monitor

22:59.111 --> 23:00.808
to see if there are any clues

23:00.852 --> 23:03.158
that the police may have missed.
Look at this.

23:04.100 --> 23:07.249
So Kaylee's monitor
took a reference photo

23:07.293 --> 23:09.034
every second, and on their own,

23:09.077 --> 23:11.340
they don't seem to show much, but...

23:11.384 --> 23:14.213
since he walks a few strides

23:14.256 --> 23:16.132
in a straight line
from the crib and then back,

23:16.175 --> 23:19.348
I'm able to simulate his walk
using motion interpolation

23:19.392 --> 23:21.437
to fill in the missing frames.

23:25.093 --> 23:27.139
There's only one guy I can think of

23:27.182 --> 23:29.582
with a limp and access
to Sandman evidence.

23:29.626 --> 23:34.233
The same person running the
investigation... DCI Turner.

23:40.570 --> 23:42.702
Okay, DCI Turner.

23:42.746 --> 23:45.270
Celebrated officer, two kids.

23:45.314 --> 23:47.446
Served in the military before
joining the police service.

23:47.490 --> 23:51.798
Sustained combat injuries in
Afghanistan on his second tour.

23:51.842 --> 23:53.357
Explains the limp.

23:53.904 --> 23:57.326
Imagine him as a soldier...
two tours, Afghanistan.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.293
When we were at the Barnes
house, I saw that he received

23:59.337 --> 24:00.536
the Valor Cross.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.111
Show us that picture.

24:03.110 --> 24:05.242
- Is that him?
- That's Benjamin Barnes.

24:05.267 --> 24:07.965
And that's... DCI Leo Turner.

24:08.163 --> 24:09.729
That's why Andrea stopped Benjamin

24:09.773 --> 24:11.122
from telling us his war story.

24:11.166 --> 24:12.986
She was afraid that we
would connect him to Turner.

24:13.030 --> 24:15.083
Turner must have told him
that we were poking around.

24:15.126 --> 24:17.085
Well, it says here
their convoy was pinned down

24:17.128 --> 24:18.825
by Taliban insurgents.

24:18.869 --> 24:20.392
Turner was hit in the leg.

24:20.436 --> 24:23.091
Barnes dragged him to safety
under heavy enemy fire.

24:23.134 --> 24:25.441
So he feels indebted to Barnes.

24:31.767 --> 24:33.666
Things didn't go quite as hoped.

24:33.710 --> 24:34.982
She's being evicted.

24:35.929 --> 24:39.019
We think DCI Turner took Finn

24:39.063 --> 24:42.110
with the intention of giving him
to Benjamin and Andrea Barnes.

24:42.153 --> 24:43.888
We should contact
Turner's immediate superior.

24:43.932 --> 24:45.161
I don't know. Not yet.

24:45.205 --> 24:46.367
No, we don't have enough evidence.

24:46.411 --> 24:47.490
Well, we have the limp,

24:47.534 --> 24:50.509
access to Sandman's case files
and the connection to Benjamin.

24:50.553 --> 24:53.077
That's enough for
us, but not a prosecutor.

24:53.121 --> 24:55.601
Uh, just need some air.

24:55.645 --> 24:56.949
Calm my nerves.

24:56.993 --> 24:58.256
Won't be long.

25:23.281 --> 25:24.990
All right.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.210
Dig into Benjamin and Andrea.

25:26.253 --> 25:27.820
Anything that might be
a motivating factor

25:27.864 --> 25:30.083
as to why they're abducting
a baby rather than adopting one.

25:30.127 --> 25:32.564
Zara, get eyes on their house.

25:32.607 --> 25:34.609
- If they leave, follow them.
- Yeah.

25:35.654 --> 25:36.960
And what about you?

25:37.003 --> 25:38.613
Let's see how Turner reacts

25:38.657 --> 25:41.007
to news that his Army buddy
suggested to Kaylee

25:41.051 --> 25:43.140
that she give up her baby for money.

25:43.183 --> 25:45.108
Should be interesting.

25:46.897 --> 25:49.714
Wait. My keys... they were in my pocket.

25:51.104 --> 25:52.721
Kaylee.

26:00.461 --> 26:02.942
Don't forget the car seat!

26:04.248 --> 26:05.858
Where's my son?

26:05.902 --> 26:07.947
I-I don't know what you're talking about.

26:07.991 --> 26:09.775
If you... if you want money...

26:09.818 --> 26:11.908
I don't want money!

26:11.951 --> 26:14.358
You and your husband took my child.

26:14.954 --> 26:16.797
Can't say it's good to see you again.

26:16.840 --> 26:19.306
- You were stalking me to get my baby.
- Kaylee,

26:19.350 --> 26:21.047
what exactly do you think
you're doing here?

26:21.091 --> 26:22.396
Shut up!

26:22.440 --> 26:25.791
Liar! You played all nice to get Finn.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.314
Then when I wouldn't
give him up, you stole him.

26:27.358 --> 26:28.794
That's nonsense, and you know it.

26:30.041 --> 26:31.492
Tell me the truth,

26:31.536 --> 26:33.103
or I'll kill him.

26:33.146 --> 26:34.669
K-Kaylee, is it?

26:35.353 --> 26:37.368
Do you really think you're
in any shape to raise a child?

26:37.411 --> 26:39.674
- Don't say another word.
- Look around.

26:39.718 --> 26:41.372
Look at what we could give him.

26:41.415 --> 26:44.331
He'd have everything... the best
schools, two loving parents.

26:44.375 --> 26:47.508
People who wanted a child,
who begged for one.

26:47.552 --> 26:49.249
He's my son. He needs me!

26:49.293 --> 26:50.816
What if you slip?

26:50.859 --> 26:53.231
Get back on drugs? I've seen it happen.

26:53.906 --> 26:56.474
I know what it's like
to have the best intentions,

26:56.517 --> 26:58.519
but you can't fight the weakness,

26:58.563 --> 27:01.348
and it's always the child who pays.

27:10.227 --> 27:11.837
Where is he?

27:11.880 --> 27:13.926
Kaylee, put down the knife.

27:15.022 --> 27:16.668
Not until they give me Finn.

27:16.711 --> 27:18.409
You're not gonna get him back this way.

27:18.452 --> 27:19.758
No one is going to believe you.

27:19.801 --> 27:22.021
- Okay?
- Oh, well...

27:22.065 --> 27:23.675
nobody does no matter what I do.

27:23.718 --> 27:25.459
You've been working so hard to make sure

27:25.503 --> 27:28.071
that when we get him back you
won't lose him to foster care.

27:28.114 --> 27:30.160
Where do you think he's gonna
end up if you're in jail?

27:35.942 --> 27:37.373
All right, Kaylee, drop the knife.

27:37.417 --> 27:40.043
Just... stay calm, let them do their job.

27:40.068 --> 27:41.240
Don't make this worse.

27:42.215 --> 27:44.826
- Hello.
- That's her... Kaylee Hobbs.

27:44.870 --> 27:46.437
Drop it. Drop it, Kaylee.

27:46.480 --> 27:48.569
Kaylee Hobbs, we're placing you
under arrest for threatening

27:48.613 --> 27:50.310
- with an offensive weapon.
- Take it easy.

27:50.354 --> 27:51.964
- You do not have to say anything.
- No. Don't.

27:52.008 --> 27:54.248
- Don't you dare. Do not touch me!
- But it may harm your defense

27:54.291 --> 27:55.858
if you do not mention, when questioned,

27:55.902 --> 27:57.381
something which you later
rely on in court.

27:57.425 --> 27:58.948
They're the criminals! They took my son!

27:58.992 --> 28:00.123
Anything which you do say
may be used in evidence.

28:00.167 --> 28:01.951
- She's insane.
- Get her out of here!

28:01.995 --> 28:04.084
- Let go of me!
- It's gonna be okay.

28:04.127 --> 28:05.302
They took my baby.

28:05.346 --> 28:07.740
They need to be arrested.

28:10.100 --> 28:11.700
So you two know each other?

28:13.156 --> 28:14.283
What does that matter?

28:14.326 --> 28:17.678
That girl came in here and
threatened my wife with a knife.

28:17.721 --> 28:19.273
I'm so sorry you had to go through that.

28:19.316 --> 28:20.883
You know exactly why she came here.

28:22.899 --> 28:24.539
You're both coming with us.

28:24.851 --> 28:26.271
You give your statements.

28:26.315 --> 28:27.565
We'll give our statements right here.

28:27.609 --> 28:29.020
You'll give them at the station

28:29.063 --> 28:31.459
where you'll be detained and deported.

28:31.503 --> 28:33.679
- Excuse me?
- On what grounds?

28:33.722 --> 28:35.637
You interfered in a police investigation.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.691
You incited a disturbed young woman

28:37.785 --> 28:39.253
into harassing these good people.

28:39.254 --> 28:41.077
That makes you an accessory.

28:51.247 --> 28:53.424
Just take a breath.
You're practically buzzing.

28:53.449 --> 28:55.886
I should have realized
the police were on their way.

28:56.049 --> 28:57.833
I mean, Benjamin's a soldier.

28:57.877 --> 28:59.964
Kaylee's a scared teenager.

29:00.008 --> 29:02.011
He could have disarmed her at any point.

29:02.055 --> 29:03.751
He wanted her caught
with that knife in her hand.

29:03.813 --> 29:05.938
I mean, any shred of credibility
she has left is gone.

29:05.981 --> 29:08.191
I know. I know.

29:10.803 --> 29:12.674
Every second we're in here,

29:12.718 --> 29:13.936
they get further away.

29:13.980 --> 29:15.764
I mean, bringing us in...

29:15.808 --> 29:17.853
this is Turner buying them time
to escape.

29:17.897 --> 29:19.115
I still don't understand

29:19.159 --> 29:21.291
how a career police officer could be okay

29:21.335 --> 29:22.597
with taking a baby away

29:22.641 --> 29:24.057
from an innocent mother.

29:24.188 --> 29:26.668
There must be a way to reason with him.

29:26.939 --> 29:29.028
I think we're past the time
for reasoning.

29:29.053 --> 29:30.131
Then what?

29:31.867 --> 29:33.826
We threaten him.

29:44.532 --> 29:46.327
I'm never gonna see Finn again, am I?

29:46.371 --> 29:48.580
- We don't know that.
- I didn't go there

29:48.623 --> 29:50.364
planning to pick up a knife.

29:50.407 --> 29:53.541
I just grabbed it in the kitchen
when I came in. I d...

29:53.585 --> 29:55.282
I don't know what I was thinking.

29:55.325 --> 29:56.849
That's the problem!

29:56.892 --> 29:58.024
You weren't thinking!

29:58.407 --> 29:59.982
Kaylee, life has given you

30:00.026 --> 30:02.811
a lot of reasons to be angry, I get it.

30:02.855 --> 30:05.727
But you can't let that anger drive you.

30:05.771 --> 30:09.165
You need to stop
and make conscious choices.

30:09.209 --> 30:10.514
Count to ten.

30:10.558 --> 30:12.351
I need to count to a thousand.

30:13.623 --> 30:15.607
What about that medallion in your pocket?

30:15.650 --> 30:18.958
Why don't you let it remind
you to look before you leap?

30:30.883 --> 30:33.015
You'll write in your own words

30:33.059 --> 30:35.322
exactly what you witnessed tonight.

30:35.365 --> 30:37.324
Kaylee Hobbs broke into a house,

30:37.367 --> 30:40.109
held the residents hostage
with a kitchen knife,

30:40.153 --> 30:42.155
spouting crazy accusations.

30:42.198 --> 30:43.852
Are they really crazy, though?

30:46.725 --> 30:47.807
Here.

30:48.083 --> 30:49.954
We used the still images
from the baby monitor

30:49.979 --> 30:51.720
to model the abductor's movement.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.719
You can see
that the kidnapper has a limp,

30:54.455 --> 30:55.995
much like yours.

30:58.743 --> 31:00.216
Means nothing.

31:02.251 --> 31:05.238
Well, not on its own,
but the other thing is access.

31:06.222 --> 31:09.212
Who had better opportunity
to study the Sandman than you?

31:09.255 --> 31:11.314
Not to mention, there was no discrepancy

31:11.358 --> 31:12.925
in the handwriting on the tarot card.

31:12.968 --> 31:15.248
How much do you want to bet one
of the originals is missing

31:15.292 --> 31:16.745
from evidence?

31:18.631 --> 31:20.154
You thought it was a win-win.

31:20.276 --> 31:22.714
Save a kid from a life with a junkie mom

31:22.739 --> 31:25.699
and give your friends the baby
they so desperately wanted.

31:25.724 --> 31:27.378
If you get caught...

31:27.403 --> 31:30.081
you will... is it worth the cost?

31:33.685 --> 31:35.649
Here's what I can offer.

31:36.562 --> 31:38.564
You tell me where Benjamin
and Andrea would go.

31:39.168 --> 31:40.953
You get that baby back to his mother.

31:40.996 --> 31:43.564
We can say we found it on a church step.

31:44.826 --> 31:46.641
No one needs to know any more than that.

31:46.666 --> 31:49.407
Benjamin's the strongest man
I know, and the only time

31:49.432 --> 31:52.217
I ever saw tears in his eyes
was when he told me

31:52.242 --> 31:54.505
that the country he was fit
to fight for decided

31:54.530 --> 31:56.066
he wasn't fit to adopt.

31:58.544 --> 32:01.721
It was just... pub chat at first.

32:03.323 --> 32:05.629
I told him about
the young mothers on the estates

32:05.673 --> 32:07.675
and how their children had no future.

32:08.807 --> 32:10.534
I told them about Kaylee.

32:11.635 --> 32:14.160
It was Andrea's idea to save her baby.

32:15.552 --> 32:18.033
Ben posed as an addict
to get close to her

32:18.370 --> 32:20.296
and make sure she was staying clean.

32:20.340 --> 32:21.683
Turner, how do we stop them?

32:21.726 --> 32:23.169
Well, you can't.

32:23.212 --> 32:25.824
Benjamin isn't just some soldier.

32:26.995 --> 32:29.606
His career was in special ops.

32:29.828 --> 32:31.743
If he wants to disappear, he'll vanish,

32:31.786 --> 32:32.919
and you will never find him.

32:32.962 --> 32:34.594
Then we get to them before they vanish.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.849
It's too late.

32:36.530 --> 32:38.924
They're picking the baby up
from his sister's.

32:38.967 --> 32:40.752
They fly in less than an hour.

32:50.602 --> 32:52.648
How far is the airfield?

32:52.691 --> 32:54.650
If we floor it, 30 minutes.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.569
You're free to go. Come on.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.744
What? How?

33:01.787 --> 33:02.919
We'll explain on the way.

33:02.962 --> 33:03.967
Yeah.

33:05.835 --> 33:07.532
Hey. You guys okay?

33:07.576 --> 33:10.144
We're fine, but we need to get
to a private airfield

33:10.187 --> 33:11.319
to stop Benjamin and Andrea.

33:11.362 --> 33:12.482
You got anything that could help?

33:12.525 --> 33:14.935
Maybe. I found out they
were rejected for adoption

33:14.979 --> 33:16.591
because he has psychiatric problems

33:16.634 --> 33:18.543
after he served in combat.

33:18.587 --> 33:20.893
And Andrea... her mother was an addict.

33:20.937 --> 33:22.634
Arrested several times.

33:22.678 --> 33:24.506
Once for child neglect.

33:24.549 --> 33:26.160
So she thinks, by abducting Finn,

33:26.203 --> 33:27.944
she's actually saving his life.

33:28.363 --> 33:29.859
Do you need me with you?

33:30.600 --> 33:32.091
Um... why?

33:32.116 --> 33:34.423
If we get that baby back,
I want to know she can keep him.

33:34.832 --> 33:36.486
Yeah. Sure.

33:36.511 --> 33:38.382
I'll come with you.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.278
Come on.

34:01.673 --> 34:02.942
What is it?

34:03.060 --> 34:05.846
We were supposed to pick the
perfect city and start over,

34:06.202 --> 34:08.117
live good lives.

34:08.289 --> 34:10.592
Going on the run was
never part of the plan.

34:10.617 --> 34:11.966
We won't be running for long.

34:11.991 --> 34:14.123
We'll start over,
have the life we deserve.

34:14.643 --> 34:16.645
We committed to this a long time ago.

34:16.688 --> 34:18.473
You don't get to say "no" now.

34:18.516 --> 34:20.358
We're too close, and he's too precious.

34:20.804 --> 34:22.938
You've promised him a good life.

34:23.217 --> 34:24.870
You never break your promises.

34:24.914 --> 34:27.003
Now get us prepped for takeoff.

34:44.101 --> 34:46.370
You think Finn's in there?

34:46.693 --> 34:48.371
One way to find out.

34:48.728 --> 34:50.156
I'm coming with you.

34:50.199 --> 34:51.592
Listen. Hang on. Hang on.

34:52.357 --> 34:54.987
You brought me in on this
'cause you needed help.

34:55.031 --> 34:56.946
Now, you trust me?

35:01.084 --> 35:02.267
All right.

35:02.311 --> 35:03.710
Stay with Zara. Now she's on comms.

35:03.753 --> 35:06.477
She'll let you listen.
She'll know when to come in.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.816
All right?

36:13.805 --> 36:15.285
Andrea?

36:15.329 --> 36:16.591
- Benjamin?!
- Andrea.

36:16.634 --> 36:18.332
Andrea, I'm not here to hurt you.

36:18.375 --> 36:19.681
I just want to talk.

36:21.639 --> 36:23.380
I realize now why you're doing this.

36:23.424 --> 36:25.121
Stay back.

36:25.164 --> 36:28.559
Shh.

36:30.213 --> 36:31.432
It's okay.

36:31.475 --> 36:33.477
He's okay. Eric's in there.

36:33.521 --> 36:35.871
I know you wanted a child of your own,

36:35.914 --> 36:37.631
but it's-it's more than that.

36:37.656 --> 36:40.224
You grew up with a mother
who was high all the time.

36:44.053 --> 36:45.837
So help me.

36:47.717 --> 36:49.719
Help me protect him.

36:50.973 --> 36:53.062
Why are you helping that horrible girl

36:53.105 --> 36:55.717
when you could be protecting
this innocent child?

36:55.760 --> 36:56.979
She's not a horrible girl.

36:57.022 --> 36:59.416
I mean, she's... tough, but if you...

36:59.460 --> 37:00.765
if you saw her again,

37:00.809 --> 37:04.073
gave her a chance,
you could understand that.

37:04.116 --> 37:04.769
Let's go.

37:07.642 --> 37:09.208
She's his mother.

37:09.905 --> 37:11.820
She's a good one.

37:16.955 --> 37:19.480
Kaylee. Kaylee.

37:19.523 --> 37:21.612
Kaylee gave birth
to the baby boy you're holding.

37:23.832 --> 37:25.964
She hasn't touched drugs
since she found out

37:26.008 --> 37:27.488
she was pregnant. When...

37:27.531 --> 37:28.924
When he disappeared,

37:28.967 --> 37:32.797
she fought every way
she knew how to get him back.

37:33.414 --> 37:35.539
Would your mother have done that?

37:48.683 --> 37:50.859
I'm so sorry.

37:51.889 --> 37:53.934
But we love him.

37:54.036 --> 37:56.125
Not like I do.

37:56.168 --> 37:59.041
Please.

38:03.437 --> 38:06.135
Don't move, any of you.

38:06.178 --> 38:08.311
All right.
Benjamin, please, take it easy.

38:08.354 --> 38:09.704
No one has to get hurt.

38:09.747 --> 38:11.880
The helicopter's ready. Let's go.

38:12.978 --> 38:14.273
Now you say you're doing this
for the child.

38:14.317 --> 38:16.349
Really, you're doing it for yourselves.

38:17.146 --> 38:21.670
For the betrayal you feel
by your country, by life.

38:21.714 --> 38:23.761
That is not Kaylee's fault, and it is

38:23.805 --> 38:25.027
not Finn's.

38:26.329 --> 38:27.765
Now you can go.

38:28.292 --> 38:30.638
Live your lives, we won't turn you in.

38:30.681 --> 38:32.944
I've already made the same deal
with Turner.

38:32.988 --> 38:34.452
But first...

38:35.773 --> 38:37.471
you need to do what's right for Finn.

38:52.275 --> 38:53.748
Put the gun down.

38:57.233 --> 38:59.104
It's over.

39:12.723 --> 39:14.246
Go.

39:24.953 --> 39:26.506
Hi.

39:47.062 --> 39:50.892
Look at that.
He's such a big boy, isn't he?

39:50.935 --> 39:53.361
He's such a beautiful big boy.

40:01.467 --> 40:03.513
Back in his own bed.

40:03.557 --> 40:05.123
In his own home.

40:05.167 --> 40:07.212
For good.

40:07.256 --> 40:08.692
How'd you pull that off?

40:08.736 --> 40:11.565
Well, I told Deena Hazari
a story about a young woman

40:11.608 --> 40:14.655
who made a lot of mistakes,
until someone believed in her.

40:14.698 --> 40:16.439
Then she pulled herself together,

40:16.482 --> 40:17.875
she grew up to be a lawyer

40:17.919 --> 40:19.697
and graduated at the top of her class.

40:21.137 --> 40:22.610
You talking about you?

40:27.493 --> 40:29.670
I'm gonna do this exactly right.

40:29.713 --> 40:32.302
I don't think any mom gets it
exactly right.

40:32.966 --> 40:34.272
But you are gonna be great.

40:44.641 --> 40:47.775
You know, you never did
say how it went with you and Kate.

40:47.800 --> 40:49.072
Yeah, the jury's still out.

40:49.097 --> 40:50.533
Yeah, I know that feeling.

40:50.558 --> 40:51.950
Never had a relationship

40:51.975 --> 40:55.152
that didn't sometimes require
flowers and candy.

40:55.177 --> 40:57.136
Well, this might be bigger than that.

40:57.161 --> 40:58.946
Yeah, well, you had no choice.

40:59.051 --> 41:01.663
- Give her some time, she'll see that.
- Mm.

41:01.919 --> 41:04.139
I know you've been
out of the game for a while,

41:04.182 --> 41:05.363
but stuff happens.

41:05.407 --> 41:06.719
Pretty normal.

41:07.316 --> 41:09.144
Right. Normal.
