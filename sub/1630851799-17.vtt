- Erika?
- Yeah.

that we're the three that

have eye surgery.

09:06.578 --> 09:08.248
And then my son
had to go over...

09:08.280 --> 09:10.115
- Recently?
- And help and then my son,

09:10.149 --> 09:11.884
he rolled his car five
times in the way home.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.219
Yeah, I'm under a lot of stress.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.209
- Wait, what?

09:15.210 --> 09:17.624
- Yeah.
- Wait, wait, hold on. Back up.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.590
- Yes.
- Recently?

09:19.919 --> 09:21.894
- So this happened--yeah.
Just a couple of days ago.

09:21.927 --> 09:23.629
Saturday.

09:23.960 --> 09:24.397
- So when you came to Garcelle's

09:24.431 --> 09:25.698
you already knew this?

09:25.731 --> 09:29.668
- Yeah, I just didn't say it.
<i>- There seems to be a pattern.</i>

09:29.702 --> 09:33.173
We'll spend time with
Erika and then find out later

09:33.206 --> 09:35.774
there was this big
situation in her life

09:35.808 --> 09:39.449
going on that she didn't
share with us like in Tahoe.

09:39.450 --> 09:41.914
- I'm really content to let
people be who they are

09:41.947 --> 09:43.883
because I like to be myself.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.818
That's one of the one things
I love about Tom the most

09:45.851 --> 09:48.538
is he lets me be myself.

09:48.539 --> 09:49.822
- Did you have any idea?
- No.

09:49.855 --> 09:52.959
- I had no idea. And we were
just in Tahoe and not one...

09:53.590 --> 09:54.827
- Zero.
- Piece about anything.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.619
- Zero zip zilch.

09:56.620 --> 09:58.865
- When Erika
withholds information,

09:58.898 --> 10:01.433
she just makes it hard
to be able to support her.

10:01.467 --> 10:04.370
- I got a call at 6:00--at
3:00 in the morning,

10:04.700 --> 10:08.207
but I didn't get it till 6:00 from
Pasadena Police Department

10:08.240 --> 10:11.440
that Tom's home
had been broken into.

10:11.769 --> 10:12.778
- The home that you lived in?
- Yeah.

10:12.812 --> 10:13.913
- While he was in it?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.948
- Yeah. He
confronted the burglar

10:15.981 --> 10:17.850
and then he had
to go to the hospital

10:17.884 --> 10:19.952
and then have
some sort of surgery.

10:19.985 --> 10:21.788
I don't really even know.

10:21.821 --> 10:23.590
- Why didn't he do a hospital?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.125
- He has glaucoma
and I think, like, pressure

10:26.158 --> 10:30.629
and the anxiety and whatever.
I'm not sure. Haven't spoken--

10:30.960 --> 10:32.164
- Having someone
enter your home--

10:32.197 --> 10:34.734
- So he said that, you know...

10:36.200 --> 10:37.636
- Wait, who rolled the car?

10:37.671 --> 10:39.639
- Well, then my son
went 'cause I can't go.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.874
And then on his way home,

10:40.907 --> 10:43.909
it was snowing and
he rolled his car.

10:43.942 --> 10:46.245
- So if Tom was burglarized,
how'd you find out?

10:46.278 --> 10:49.649
Tom confronted the burglars.
Did they do anything to him?

10:49.682 --> 10:52.652
And what about your son?
Was he hurt? His car flipped.

10:52.686 --> 10:55.488
He's okay. This story
obviously sounds unbelievable.

10:55.522 --> 10:57.570
That's the only
word I can think of.

10:57.899 --> 10:59.225
It sounds unbelievable.

10:59.259 --> 11:01.326
Does that mean I
don't believe her?

11:01.360 --> 11:05.648
No. But it's unbelievable.

11:05.649 --> 11:07.100
It was snowing in Pasadena?

11:07.133 --> 11:08.634
- He lives further out.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.736
- And your son is okay.
- Yeah, he's fine.

11:10.769 --> 11:12.905
- And we think Tom is okay?

11:12.938 --> 11:14.941
- I know he--he made
it out of surgery okay.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.942
I don't know what
happened after that.

11:16.975 --> 11:19.346
- Erika, I don't even
know. It's like this is...

11:19.379 --> 11:22.881
- It's like all
crushing at one time.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.783
- I'm sorry, Erika.

11:26.753 --> 11:28.187
- Yeah, me too.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.898
- [muffled] Girls, what
are you doing right now?

11:30.899 --> 11:32.892
- [muffled laughter] Rinna.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.793
- This is so right
up your alley.

11:34.827 --> 11:37.128
- It's so good, isn't it?
- Look at the lips.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.664
- I know.
- Look at the lips.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.165
- It's amazing.
It's almost like.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.801
- Oh, my God. No.

11:41.835 --> 11:43.302
[laughing]
- Like Cleopatra.

11:43.336 --> 11:47.106
- Rinna, with the hair.
[laughing]

11:52.912 --> 11:56.716
- Jaid, do you need me?

11:58.150 --> 12:00.320
[knocking at door] Coming.

12:01.921 --> 12:03.690
<i>- Garcelle.
- Hello.</i>

12:03.722 --> 12:04.957
<i>- I am so excited.</i>

12:05.580 --> 12:06.393
- You're coming in hot.
- I'm coming in hot.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.761
I have a lot to
share with you today.

12:08.794 --> 12:11.264
Can I get you anything,
water or champagne?

12:11.297 --> 12:13.198
- I'm on the clock, but
I'll take some water.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.900
- The last time you were here

12:14.933 --> 12:17.836
I can't believe
how much I cried.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.572
It's always been,
"I take care of me.

12:20.606 --> 12:22.749
I take care of my--myself."

12:22.750 --> 12:24.768
- But what would
it feel like, Garcelle,

12:24.769 --> 12:26.789
if you could let go for a second

12:26.790 --> 12:29.783
and let somebody
else tell you I got you.

12:29.816 --> 12:31.317
- I want to get to there.

12:31.350 --> 12:33.586
<i>Trust always has
been important to me.</i>

12:33.620 --> 12:35.889
Trust is the most
important thing

12:35.922 --> 12:38.158
you can have in
any relationship.

12:38.191 --> 12:40.592
After my divorce,
my trust issues

12:40.626 --> 12:42.595
kept me from
dating for a long time.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.970
- You set up your
Bumble profile.

12:44.129 --> 12:46.198
- I did. I mean, I
didn't write a lot.

12:46.231 --> 12:48.368
- Let's look at your profile.
- Okay.

12:48.400 --> 12:50.202
- You're obviously
very photogenic.

12:50.235 --> 12:51.937
- Thank you.
[both laugh]

12:51.971 --> 12:54.206
- But we need to fill in a
little bit more about you.

12:54.240 --> 12:58.109
So we can go with
I'm a real nerd about.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.113
- Is watching
documentaries nerdy?

13:00.145 --> 13:02.749
- Yeah, that could be.
Like are you really into--

13:02.782 --> 13:05.184
- One of my favorite shows
is "Say Yes to the Dress."

13:05.217 --> 13:08.538
- That is not subtle at all.

13:08.539 --> 13:09.923
Everybody will be like,
"Okay, I know what she wants."

13:09.956 --> 13:11.725
- "She wants to get married."
- All right,

13:11.758 --> 13:14.126
there's actually a guy
that I'm going to have

13:14.159 --> 13:17.628
one of my matchmaker
friends show to you

13:17.629 --> 13:19.264
and see if you might be
interested to meet up with him.

13:19.298 --> 13:20.399
- Okay.

13:20.432 --> 13:22.402
<i>I like the idea of a matchmaker.</i>

13:22.434 --> 13:24.236
I don't want to swipe
to meet someone.

13:24.269 --> 13:26.239
I want to have a
connection across the room.

13:26.272 --> 13:29.408
I want to bump into you as
we're going through a doorway.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.144
I don't know. Call
me old school.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.245
- Okay, here we go.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.812
- And she's gonna
tell me about him?

13:33.846 --> 13:36.383
- Yeah.
<i>- Hi.</i>

13:36.415 --> 13:38.951
- Bonnie.
- So nice to meet you.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.453
<i>- So nice to meet you too. So--</i>

13:41.488 --> 13:43.888
- Okay, so--

13:43.889 --> 13:45.392
<i>He kickboxes.</i>
- Oh, okay.

13:45.424 --> 13:47.326
So he's in shape.
<i>- He's 49.</i>

13:47.360 --> 13:50.397
<i>He is unencumbered by children.</i>

13:50.429 --> 13:52.432
- I want a strong,
confident man.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.100
I want a man who
has his own life.

13:54.134 --> 13:57.437
I want a man who knows
who he is and if he has kids,

13:57.470 --> 13:58.937
he's a great father.

13:58.971 --> 14:01.106
<i>I want a man who's
great with his mom.</i>

14:01.140 --> 14:03.429
And I want a man
who's comforting enough

14:03.759 --> 14:04.543
to let me be me.

14:04.576 --> 14:06.513
<i>- I think it's certainly
worth meeting him.</i>

14:06.546 --> 14:08.447
- Yeah, absolutely.
I mean, you both

14:08.480 --> 14:10.383
are recommending
him so I, you know--

14:10.417 --> 14:12.317
And be monogamous
and be kind and be sexy

14:12.351 --> 14:14.495
and know how to
dance and know how to--

14:14.496 --> 14:16.789
He doesn't have to know
how to cook. I'll do that.

14:19.590 --> 14:20.427
- Ready?
<i>- Here we go.</i>

14:20.460 --> 14:24.864
- Oh (BLEEP).
[laughs]

14:24.898 --> 14:26.499
Wow, he's hot.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.467
[sighs] I see Keith's abs

14:28.500 --> 14:31.870
and then I hear my bed
springs making noise.

14:31.904 --> 14:34.173
Ladies, awesome job!

14:34.206 --> 14:37.143
I'm so hot right now.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.477
- We'll set up the date and--

14:38.510 --> 14:40.145
- Oh, it's gonna be
a date right away?

14:40.179 --> 14:41.880
Not talking on the phone,
not texting or nothing?

14:41.914 --> 14:44.350
<i>- I really just think
you would have to meet</i>

14:44.384 --> 14:46.219
<i>and do that.</i>

14:46.251 --> 14:47.519
- I mean, with a body like that.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.955
- Listen,

14:48.988 --> 14:51.908
Dorit will make
more wedding dress.

14:51.909 --> 14:52.491
[laughter]

15:02.501 --> 15:04.103
[knocking at door]

15:04.104 --> 15:05.371
- Crystal?
- Yeah.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.398
Both: Hi.
- Come in.

15:07.399 --> 15:09.241
- How are you? both: Mwah, mwah.

15:09.274 --> 15:11.110
- You look cute. So what--what--

15:11.144 --> 15:13.178
<i>- Oh, let me show you.
Can I show you really quick?</i>

15:13.212 --> 15:15.514
The basement. We put a
theatre and the golf simulator.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.884
- Oh. Well, oh, my God,
my husband wants a--

15:17.917 --> 15:20.529
- I know. I can't
wait. I'll bring it here.

15:20.860 --> 15:22.548
Robbie and I were in the process

15:22.549 --> 15:23.456
of finishing out our basement.

15:23.490 --> 15:27.360
Oh, my God. So much stuff.

15:27.394 --> 15:29.619
- So where is all the
equipment going?

15:29.620 --> 15:31.638
- Behind the bar? Where's
the pizza maker go?

15:31.639 --> 15:32.264
- Right there.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.168
- I would like to
keep it six figures.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.202
It's like 1,800 for a
feet just the space.

15:37.236 --> 15:38.672
- Really big.

15:38.705 --> 15:42.375
- It's going to be a bar,
movie theater, full kitchen,

15:42.408 --> 15:45.278
wine cellar, golf
simulator room.

15:45.311 --> 15:47.212
High-end game room.
What do you call it?

15:47.246 --> 15:48.615
The golf simulator,

15:48.648 --> 15:50.350
that's the only thing
that's costing you money.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.585
Because Rob's so tall,
his swing hits the ceiling.

15:52.619 --> 15:54.254
I have to re-dig
into the ground.

15:54.287 --> 15:56.505
It's like six figures.
It's fortune to do this.

15:56.506 --> 15:58.892
<i>My dad was always
very frugal. I'm frugal.</i>

15:58.924 --> 16:02.394
Rob is not frugal. He
always says "I work hard"

16:02.428 --> 16:04.464
and he likes to spend
his money, enjoy his life.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.432
- I am sorry. He's gonna
have to crunch down.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.134
That's--that's way
too much money.

16:08.168 --> 16:11.705
- The total Janet
came up a million.

16:11.738 --> 16:13.373
- What?
- I know,

16:13.405 --> 16:17.109
but we cut it down
so we're at like five.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.177
- So half a million.
- Yeah.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.578
- To do down here.
- Yes.

16:19.611 --> 16:22.479
- I can't argue that I
don't spend money.

16:22.480 --> 16:23.549
<i>I will splurge on something</i>

16:23.582 --> 16:25.485
<i>if I know it's going
to appreciate in value.</i>

16:25.518 --> 16:28.538
For example, I'm willing
to spend a lot of money

16:28.539 --> 16:29.522
on an expensive handbag.

16:29.556 --> 16:33.426
- Okay, the bag over there
is very distracting. I cannot.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.361
- I had it on
display just for you.

16:35.394 --> 16:39.399
Certain bags at a certain
level increase in value,

16:39.432 --> 16:42.501
just like when you renovate
your home, it'll appreciate.

16:42.534 --> 16:45.238
So if that's frugal...

16:45.270 --> 16:47.418
Dictionary. Put
me in there. It's fine.

16:47.419 --> 16:49.274
I have water. I have green tea.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.644
- Thank you so much.
- All right, so,

16:51.677 --> 16:53.379
Garcelle's party.
- Yeah.

16:53.413 --> 16:56.448
It was all nice and friendly
and pretend friendly.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.150
It was pretend friendly I guess.

16:58.183 --> 17:00.860
- See, I know that you guys
think that's okay not to, like,

17:00.120 --> 17:02.422
just don't talk whatever.
I cannot live like that.

17:02.455 --> 17:05.124
It's weird when two
people at the table

17:05.125 --> 17:06.558
are not talking to. This
is not a party of 200.

17:06.593 --> 17:07.861
- Not gonna lie, it
was uncomfortable.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.429
- I think Garcelle
said she was triggered

17:09.461 --> 17:12.365
about something
between us and I'm like...

17:12.398 --> 17:13.266
- Oh, yeah.

17:13.298 --> 17:15.101
- You guys have a
conversation about me

17:15.134 --> 17:16.435
that it's something
like calling me

17:16.469 --> 17:18.371
a liar that--or
questions my integrity,

17:18.404 --> 17:20.173
please say it to me.
Is that making sense?

17:20.205 --> 17:22.342
- It's making sense but
it's triggering me though

17:22.375 --> 17:23.476
because you're saying,
"If you're going to

17:23.509 --> 17:24.743
"call me a liar,
call it to my face.

17:24.778 --> 17:26.346
Don't wait six months."

17:26.378 --> 17:29.490
And that's what
happened between us.

17:29.819 --> 17:31.116
- I thought we got
past that. I don't know.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.252
- I think that's hard for
her if she doesn't feel totally

17:33.286 --> 17:34.887
in the group whatever
that means to her.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.556
- She is included
in every single thing.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.391
- I don't see the exclusion.

17:38.424 --> 17:39.558
- No.
- But when she mentioned that.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.494
- I don't know where I sit,
honestly, with this group.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.432
I, in a way, feel like
an outsider a little bit.

17:45.464 --> 17:48.167
- Why?
- I don't know why.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.736
- I don't know if it's a
sense or she's told me,

17:49.769 --> 17:51.337
but I don't think she
has a lot of friends.

17:51.371 --> 17:53.472
I think she has a couple
of close friend, Garcelle.

17:53.506 --> 17:56.175
So for her, if
you're her friend,

17:56.209 --> 17:58.411
it's like you're
her best friend.

17:58.444 --> 18:00.779
I don't feel like
an outsider myself,

18:00.814 --> 18:03.383
<i>but Garcelle is more guarded</i>

18:03.415 --> 18:06.117
<i>and probably has been
hurt by friends in the past.</i>

18:06.118 --> 18:08.320
So I think she just takes
more time to open up.

18:08.355 --> 18:10.222
Maybe she's just holding
onto what happened

18:10.256 --> 18:11.724
to you guys last year.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.294
I don't know why you
can't get deeper and closer,

18:14.326 --> 18:18.464
but sometimes that
just doesn't happen.

18:18.498 --> 18:19.632
<i>- Coming up...</i>

18:19.665 --> 18:22.391

Erika's not telling the truth?

18:22.392 --> 18:24.671
- No, I'm suggesting she's
been in a controlling marriage

- I'm good. And you?

19:21.827 --> 19:23.289
- Good.

19:23.630 --> 19:24.297
- I got some fruit tarts

19:24.329 --> 19:26.199

make-- I just got, like,

19:28.567 --> 19:30.703
ice cream and then
cookies I was gonna make,

19:30.737 --> 19:32.404
just baking the right kind.
- Oh, yeah.

19:32.439 --> 19:34.606
- So I saw Erika a
couple of days ago.

19:34.641 --> 19:36.608
You know what she told me?
- What?

19:36.643 --> 19:41.247
- [sighs] Someone
broke into Tom's house.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.472
- Someone broke
into Tom's house?

19:43.473 --> 19:44.483
- Mm-hmm.
- And?

19:44.517 --> 19:47.619
- He, like, confronted
the intruder or something

19:47.653 --> 19:50.490
and something happened
and he ended up in the hospital.

19:50.522 --> 19:51.790
- What?

19:51.825 --> 19:53.292
- And it gets crazier.
- Wait a second.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.862
- It gets crazier. Her son,
I guess it was snowing

19:55.894 --> 19:57.730
'cause he lives,
like, farther north,

19:57.763 --> 20:02.368
I guess, and he
rolled his car six times.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.769
- What?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.471
- So Dorit's putting on
this massive party tomorrow

20:05.505 --> 20:06.905
and it's--

20:06.940 --> 20:08.540
- Oh, for the wedding stuff?
- And it's raining.

20:08.575 --> 20:10.276
- We saw some of the
photos of those dresses.

20:10.309 --> 20:11.510
They look hot.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.644
- They're amazing actually.

20:12.679 --> 20:14.314
- They look hot.
- Truly good.

20:14.346 --> 20:15.615
- Careful.

20:15.647 --> 20:18.351
Guys, dinner's ready.
It looks beautiful.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.819
I just want to make
sure that it's okay inside.

20:20.854 --> 20:22.788
- Honey, did you blacken it?
- No, I didn't.

20:22.821 --> 20:24.356
I did something
different tonight, honey.

20:24.391 --> 20:25.491
Do you need salt?

20:25.525 --> 20:28.126
- I need some
mayonnaise or tartar.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.561
- Oh, PK, come on, baby.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.970
- What do you think
this is? Morton's?

20:31.131 --> 20:32.598
- Ugh, Kyle. I'll do a
quick tartar for him.

20:32.632 --> 20:34.099
- No, honey, don't
make something.

20:34.134 --> 20:35.434
- I don't know
how to make tartar.

20:35.468 --> 20:36.802
- I do.
- Honey, don't worry about it.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.772
- Why would anybody put
mayonnaise on salmon?

20:39.806 --> 20:42.142
- Where we putting the salad?
- I'm putting it for you.

20:42.174 --> 20:43.442
- On the salad plate.

20:43.476 --> 20:47.780
- What are you? Kathy Hilton?
[British accent] Blimey, PK.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.383
This not a restaurant. Get lost.

20:50.416 --> 20:52.519
- Oh, my God. Kyle was
telling me the craziest story,

20:52.551 --> 20:54.220
you guys, in the kitchen.

20:54.253 --> 20:58.357
Erika told Kyle that someone
broke into Tom's house.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.226
Tom was confronted
by the intruder,

21:00.259 --> 21:01.461
but I don't know
what that means.

21:01.493 --> 21:02.761
- I don't know what happened,

21:02.796 --> 21:04.631
but Tom ended
up in the hospital.

21:04.663 --> 21:07.133
- What?
- How did Erika know?

21:07.166 --> 21:08.300
- Well, he's in the hospital.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.803
- I thought they had--

21:09.836 --> 21:11.471
- But she was--she was
alerted somehow. I don't know.

21:11.503 --> 21:13.605
- Wait, you get--the
story gets crazier.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.342
- You're not gonna
believe this story.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.676
- She sent her son who's a
police officer to check on him.

21:17.711 --> 21:19.846
The son went home,
was driving home.

21:19.878 --> 21:22.481
Her son lives somewhere
where it was snowing,

21:22.515 --> 21:24.683
flipped his car six times.

21:24.718 --> 21:25.751
- What?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.586
- What are you laughing at?

21:27.619 --> 21:29.388
- I'm like it's so shocking, PK.

21:29.422 --> 21:31.357
- Is it true?
- Poor girl, poor kid.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.959
- Obviously it's true.
It's what she said.

21:32.991 --> 21:34.394
- I thought, when
you flip a car,

21:34.426 --> 21:35.627
you know, you break your bones.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.663
- What are guys talking about?

21:36.695 --> 21:38.498
This--is this for real
or is this a fake story?

21:38.530 --> 21:39.932
- No, it's for real.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.433
Honey, it's for real.
Erika's told me this.

21:41.468 --> 21:42.801
- Come on.

21:42.836 --> 21:45.704
I don't know if you know
about the previous story

21:45.739 --> 21:47.574
about Tom flipping the car.

21:47.606 --> 21:48.875
I don't know if
you're aware of that.

21:48.907 --> 21:50.676
- So we were in
La Quinta and Erika

21:50.710 --> 21:54.713
tells us that 3 1/2 years ago
when he had this accident,

21:54.748 --> 21:57.349
he ended up
driving off of a cliff

21:57.384 --> 21:59.885
or a hill and the car flipped

21:59.919 --> 22:02.489
and he kind of
came out of the car.

22:02.521 --> 22:06.526
- He had a head injury
and he broke his shoulder,

22:06.558 --> 22:08.795
snapped his ankle, and
then broke his clavicle.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.829
- He crashed into a wall
or what'd he crash into?

22:10.864 --> 22:12.649
- He drove off a cliff.

22:12.650 --> 22:14.634
- They were in the ER. He
needed some type of surgery.

22:14.667 --> 22:15.602
- On his brain.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.737
- I did not allow them
to do surgery on him

22:17.770 --> 22:20.573
because I was concerned
because he had been unconscious.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.541
- I think it was the brain
or something because--

22:22.575 --> 22:23.809
- It was his brain.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.310
- And then she said
she didn't want him

22:25.345 --> 22:26.913
to be operated on
because of his age.

22:26.945 --> 22:29.481
- I'm not a
statisician--statastician?

22:29.516 --> 22:30.482
- Statistician.

22:30.517 --> 22:33.752
- A statistician. But
what are the statistics

22:33.787 --> 22:39.826
that Tom and his
stepson both flip cars?

22:39.858 --> 22:40.993
I would guess they're millions

22:41.940 --> 22:42.796
and millions and
millions to one.

22:42.828 --> 22:45.230
Statistically, it's
basically impossible.

22:45.265 --> 22:46.700
- What you're suggesting then

22:46.732 --> 22:48.601
is that Erika's not
telling the truth.

22:48.634 --> 22:50.903
- No, I'm suggesting she's
been in a controlling marriage

22:50.936 --> 22:52.104
for 20 years

22:52.105 --> 22:53.772
and she's still
being controlled.

22:53.807 --> 22:57.943
I think that Tom lied to
Erika and Erika went along.

22:57.977 --> 22:59.346
There's no car rolling.

22:59.378 --> 23:00.846
There's no 12 hours unconscious.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.348
- Just saying.

23:02.382 --> 23:03.817
- It's, to me, it's transparent.

23:03.849 --> 23:05.285
- Let me tell you something.

23:05.317 --> 23:07.953
There's lies all over the place.

23:08.539 --> 23:11.391
If a doctor comes to you and
says your husband's been hurt,

23:11.423 --> 23:13.292
he's rolled over and
he's been unconscious

23:13.326 --> 23:14.661
and we need to operate.

23:14.693 --> 23:16.363
- Who says no?
- Who says no?

23:16.395 --> 23:17.596
- Who says no?

23:17.630 --> 23:21.300
- Hearing my husband
and PK's reaction...

23:23.336 --> 23:26.940
is making me question
myself. It's a lot more difficult

23:26.972 --> 23:30.809
when you're so close
to the situation and know

23:30.844 --> 23:32.878
Erika, as well as
Dorit and I know Erika.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.647
- But Erika is the
one telling the story.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.483
Erika was the
one that found him.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.419
Erika's the one that was
in the hospital with him.

23:39.451 --> 23:43.823
And I respect your opinion.
The story is bonkers.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.592
There are details missing,

23:45.625 --> 23:48.294
but I don't believe for one
second that Erika is lying.

23:48.327 --> 23:51.564
<i>It's just such a story
that is so difficult</i>

23:51.597 --> 23:53.562
<i>to wrap your head around.</i>

23:53.563 --> 23:57.604
Why would she make that up?
Why would she make that up?

23:57.636 --> 23:59.638
Obviously, you
have to believe it.

23:59.673 --> 24:03.343
It's crazy, but I have no
reason not to believe her.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.545
- If she's going to
have any credibility,

24:05.577 --> 24:08.882
there has to come a point
where she goes enough's enough.

24:08.914 --> 24:12.419
- Well, PK also thinks--PK
thinks, as a manager,

24:12.451 --> 24:14.688
he seen some of
her Instagram posts

24:14.721 --> 24:17.624
and he thinks that
bad moves. Bad.

24:17.656 --> 24:18.892
<i>- I know.
- Bad moves.</i>

24:18.924 --> 24:20.930
<i>- Oh, Kyle showed
me a couple of them.</i>

24:20.125 --> 24:21.560
<i>Definitely bad
moves. No question.</i>

24:21.594 --> 24:22.895
<i>- Why is she doing it?
- I would love her</i>

24:22.929 --> 24:24.564
<i>to have the comeback
of comebacks</i>

24:24.596 --> 24:28.567
but not if she can't break
loose of the shackles

24:28.601 --> 24:30.369
of the world she's been in.

24:30.403 --> 24:33.873

a credible guy with these

24:33.906 --> 24:36.758
----ing stories of the
flipped cars and the--

24:36.759 --> 24:38.912
- Hold on. Here's
another scenario.

24:38.944 --> 24:41.748
So they get to the ER
and the doctor says,

24:41.780 --> 24:43.916
"Listen, he may
have had brain trauma

24:43.950 --> 24:45.585
"or there was some head trauma.

24:45.617 --> 24:49.888
We want to operate on his
ankle or we want to operate--"

24:49.923 --> 24:51.909
- I thought [indistinct]

24:51.910 --> 24:52.759
he got his head bruised.
- Whatever, what I'm trying

24:52.791 --> 24:53.660
to say is...
- Maybe it was that.

24:53.692 --> 24:55.627
- I cannot engage
in this conversation.

24:55.662 --> 24:57.797
- We don't know what he had.
- Let's not do the brain.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.366
Let's focus on the ankle, right?

25:00.400 --> 25:02.201
He's not a ----ing
soccer player.

25:02.234 --> 25:05.872
He's a lawyer. This is
a 79-year-old lawyer.

25:05.904 --> 25:07.773
- We have to
operate on his ankle

25:07.807 --> 25:09.576
'cause he has

26:02.162 --> 26:04.230
<i>My clothes are
all tight. Not fun.</i>

[laughter]

26:11.304 --> 26:13.506

stop by tonight, which is fun.

26:21.847 --> 26:23.950
- Oh.
- Yeah, I know. How about that.

26:24.500 --> 26:25.684
He's got a couple
of Zoom meetings

26:25.719 --> 26:26.819
and then he's
gonna come stop by.

26:26.853 --> 26:31.569
Well, actually nobody
knows. But they'll be excited.

26:32.726 --> 26:36.496
I love her. Yeah. Well,
do we name her Valeria?

26:36.528 --> 26:39.164
- Valeria in that
sexy olive dress.

26:39.199 --> 26:42.102
- Olive Alex Perry.
Let's get our glam on.

26:42.134 --> 26:43.903
<i>- Let's do this.</i>

26:50.943 --> 26:53.278
- I'm going to go do a run
through with the models.

26:53.313 --> 26:54.980
Anyone have a time check?

26:55.809 --> 26:56.682
- 5:28.
- Sh--.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.838
- There's a couple
of moving parts.

26:58.839 --> 26:59.752
There's limited
time to go through it.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.219
It's crunch time. Time
doesn't stop for us.

27:02.220 --> 27:05.258
- If it wasn't COVID, I'd have
a much bigger launch party,

27:05.290 --> 27:07.693

27:07.727 --> 27:12.650

models standing on the ladders

27:12.980 --> 27:14.134

- You're the bride.

27:18.238 --> 27:19.673
- Like we're actually
in--in our wedding. I know.

27:19.705 --> 27:20.874
- I know it feels a bit
like that, doesn't it?

27:20.906 --> 27:22.174
- It does.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.440
But I had to scale it
back and I had to think,

27:24.769 --> 27:25.912
"Okay, I have to
do this in my house."

27:25.944 --> 27:27.579
Still,

It's so great as a
designer to have an idea

32:49.234 --> 32:53.906
and then to transform that
idea into an actual product.

32:53.940 --> 32:56.241
- I like the sensor.
I love the princess.

32:56.276 --> 32:58.110

33:48.560 --> 33:51.597
Jessica is wearing the angel.
- Pretty.

33:51.631 --> 33:54.433
This creation was inspired
for the angelic bride.

33:54.467 --> 33:55.734
- No one here.
[laughter]

33:55.769 --> 33:58.171
- And the angel
has multiple layers

33:58.203 --> 33:59.673

33:59.705 --> 34:01.473
- I mean, wow.

34:01.508 --> 34:05.244

Beverly Beach, isn't it?

34:07.747 --> 34:10.114
- All right.
- Whoo!

34:10.115 --> 34:12.519

This is called the Moment.
- Yes!

34:15.688 --> 34:19.159
- The Moment is a
two-piece gown worn by Ariel.

34:19.192 --> 34:22.295
- Whoo!

a dress I call the Actress.

CJ is wearing the Pearl.

pearls in an array of clusters.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.708
Absolutely gorgeous.

34:34.740 --> 34:39.411
- My dress was $1,200
and I think my wedding

34:39.445 --> 34:42.315
was probably the same
amount as that dress.

34:43.483 --> 34:46.119
- This is, like, one of our
most expensive dresses.

34:46.152 --> 34:49.489
Want to say like $35,000.
- $35,000?

34:49.521 --> 34:52.492
- Last but not
least, this is Zita.

34:52.525 --> 34:53.760
- Wow.

34:53.793 --> 34:56.429
- She's in the Princess.
- Wow.

34:56.463 --> 34:58.565
- This is our grand
princess ball gown...

34:58.597 --> 35:00.666
- This is so pretty.

35:02.349 --> 35:04.336
- Gorgeous.
- Yay.

35:04.371 --> 35:06.806
- I'm wearing the Woman.

35:06.840 --> 35:11.210
[cheers and applause]

35:11.244 --> 35:12.778
- Bravo.
- Gorgeous.

35:12.811 --> 35:16.115
- Thank you, everyone.
- Yay! Congratulations!

35:16.148 --> 35:17.182
- Bravo.

35:17.217 --> 35:20.118
<i>- I would love to wear
one of these dresses,</i>

35:20.119 --> 35:23.722
but I don't need to get married
again or to do a vow renewal.

35:23.757 --> 35:25.190
- I'm not getting married again.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.525
What are you? Crazy?

35:26.559 --> 35:29.795
- Sutton doesn't want
to get married again.

35:29.829 --> 35:31.697
I'll leave that to Garcelle.

35:31.731 --> 35:33.733
- Um...
[laughs]

35:33.766 --> 35:35.835
I--I...

35:35.869 --> 35:38.170
Maybe.

35:38.204 --> 35:39.838
- Gonna go get changed.

35:39.873 --> 35:41.474
- That was great, wasn't it?

35:41.507 --> 35:43.476
- Great.
- So nice.

35:43.510 --> 35:46.413
- Zucchini fritters.
- Oh, thank you so much.

35:46.445 --> 35:50.349
- Zucchini, fennel,
[indistinct], edible flower.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.117
- This is delicious.

35:52.152 --> 35:53.353
- It is really good.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.221
- Amazing.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.125
- Go ahead.
- Uh-huh.

36:00.126 --> 36:02.695
- Please go ahead.
Feel free. You feel guilty?

36:02.728 --> 36:05.731
- No. No, because I
never said anything bad.

36:05.764 --> 36:07.400
I just gave advice.

36:07.434 --> 36:11.371
The wife goes, "No,
no, no, not the brain.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.373
Do the ----ing ankle."

36:16.208 --> 36:18.143
- [laughs]

36:19.346 --> 36:21.748
- Oh, gorgeous.
- Nice.

36:21.780 --> 36:25.818
Dorit, not only did you
do such an incredible job.

36:25.851 --> 36:28.320
These designs are
absolutely beautiful

36:28.355 --> 36:30.856
<i>- I'm so glad that I
pulled it off without a hitch.</i>

36:30.889 --> 36:33.126
Mission accomplished.

36:33.159 --> 36:34.827
[doorbell rings]
- Who's that, my love?

36:35.829 --> 36:38.264
- Harry Hamlin.
- There he is! Oh, my gosh!

36:38.297 --> 36:39.666
- Harry!

36:39.699 --> 36:42.168
Both: Harry Hamlin.
- Mr. Hamlin.

36:42.202 --> 36:43.302
- Welcome.
- Hi. How are you?

36:43.335 --> 36:46.373
Yeah. Hello, everybody.
Hello, Garcelle, everybody.

36:46.405 --> 36:47.740
- Harry, we love
having you here.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.742
- Hi, that's beautiful.
How gorgeous this is.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.911
You I can hug.
- I know, hi.

36:51.945 --> 36:53.780
I'm always excited to see Harry.

36:53.813 --> 36:56.782
- We haven't seen you since
we brought COVID to your house.

36:56.815 --> 36:59.552
- I act like that when
he walks in the kitchen.

36:59.585 --> 37:02.121
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you. Thank you.

37:02.155 --> 37:04.590
Thank you. I'm okay. One
foot in front of the other.

37:04.623 --> 37:05.759
- I understand. I get it, 100%,

37:05.791 --> 37:07.494
but life is filled
with vicissitudes

37:07.527 --> 37:10.764
and, you know, it's how we
deal with them in the long run.

37:10.797 --> 37:12.931
- Yes. Thank you. Thank
you. Thank you for asking.

37:13.329 --> 37:15.802
- Oh, Harry, congratulations
on the new role.

37:15.835 --> 37:18.371
I'm so excited.
- Yes, congratulations.

37:18.405 --> 37:21.675
- Harry is gonna do a
show for Ridley Scott,

37:21.708 --> 37:23.409
and he's going to
play Tom Brokaw.

37:23.443 --> 37:24.844
- He is?
- Oh, wow.

37:24.878 --> 37:27.780
- So I'm basically ----ing
Tom Brokaw right now.

37:27.813 --> 37:30.150
<i>I'm excited for him.
He's got to go to Canada</i>

37:30.182 --> 37:33.652
and I always miss Harry
when he goes to do a role,

37:33.686 --> 37:38.657
but I have definitely formed a
stronger dependency on Harry

37:38.692 --> 37:40.659
during these last 10 months.

37:40.693 --> 37:43.463
- Everybody loves Tom
Brokaw that's why I'm terrified.

37:43.496 --> 37:44.563
- Why?

37:44.597 --> 37:46.666
- But you're actually gonna
be a great Tom Brokaw.

37:46.699 --> 37:48.367
- You're gonna be an
amazing Tom Brokaw.

37:48.400 --> 37:49.668
- He's deep and high.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.338
- And then deep and
high at the same time--

37:51.371 --> 37:52.539
- Even high at the same time.

37:52.572 --> 37:55.407
And his vowels
always go like tod-ay.

37:55.442 --> 37:57.811
You know, he goes...
- Yes!

37:57.844 --> 37:59.211
<i>- I will be missing him.</i>

37:59.244 --> 38:04.169
He feeds me. He grows
my food, protects me.

38:04.170 --> 38:07.786
I'm sure he's
really excited to go.

38:07.820 --> 38:11.791
- Guys, mingle and chit chat
and we can grab a cocktail,

38:11.824 --> 38:14.661
get up, sit down.
- Okay then, mingle.

38:16.362 --> 38:17.563
- It's different.

38:17.597 --> 38:18.864
You're super busy. I'm not busy.

38:18.898 --> 38:20.699
- Super busy.
- I'm not busy.

38:20.733 --> 38:22.202
- I know.

38:22.235 --> 38:24.204
- My sister really makes
me laugh. I swear to God.

38:24.237 --> 38:26.572
You know, the new Bernie
Sanders meme everywhere?

38:26.606 --> 38:28.440
- Yeah.
- Kathy sends me a picture,

38:28.474 --> 38:29.742
<i>and goes, "Who is this old man?</i>

38:29.775 --> 38:31.344
Is this the new elf on a shelf?"

38:31.378 --> 38:33.880
[laughter] And she
keeps sending the meme.

38:33.913 --> 38:36.488
She goes, "There's
that old man again."

38:36.489 --> 38:38.485
- I didn't know if that was the
Kentucky Fried Chicken guy

38:38.518 --> 38:39.652
or who it was.

38:39.686 --> 38:41.387
I was like...

38:41.420 --> 38:42.856
- Colonel Sanders.
- Colonel Sanders.

38:42.889 --> 38:45.657
- Colonel Sanders.
- Colonel, Bernie Sanders.

38:45.692 --> 38:47.659
- Oh, my God!
- There you go!

38:47.693 --> 38:49.496
- Why did you leave real estate?

38:49.528 --> 38:50.663
- I went broke.
- Oh.

38:50.697 --> 38:52.599
- Tell him how much you
lost now that you're already--

38:52.632 --> 38:53.800
- I know you lost $1 billion.

38:53.833 --> 38:55.601
- No, it was--it
was closer to 2--

38:55.635 --> 38:56.902
- 10 billion?
- 2 billion.

38:56.936 --> 38:58.704
- 2 billion?
- Yeah.

38:58.737 --> 39:01.554
But I didn't really lose
it. I'm still looking for it.

39:01.555 --> 39:03.899
I was looking
behind there tonight.

39:03.900 --> 39:05.449
I was thinking,
"Is it here, Harry?"

39:05.780 --> 39:06.512
This could be good.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.748
- Bernie Sanders has
everybody up in arms.

39:08.782 --> 39:10.916
- Wait, you had
everyone up in arms today.

39:11.170 --> 39:12.552
- About what? What'd I do?

39:12.585 --> 39:15.889
- You made a little comment
that went everywhere.

39:15.922 --> 39:17.423
- (BLEEP).

39:23.762 --> 39:24.898
- You had everyone
up in arms today.

39:25.465 --> 39:26.932
- About what? What'd I do?

39:27.329 --> 39:30.536
- You made a little comment
that went everywhere.

39:30.570 --> 39:31.938
- Oh (BLEEP).

39:32.380 --> 39:33.639
- You said that we're
all coming after you.

39:33.672 --> 39:34.641
- What? What? What?

39:34.673 --> 39:36.443
<i>- She did some
interview on "Ellen" today</i>

39:36.476 --> 39:37.476
<i>with Mario Lopez</i>

39:37.510 --> 39:39.512
<i>asks what was it like
being in this group?</i>

39:39.545 --> 39:41.313
And she said, "Well, they're
all coming after me and now

39:41.347 --> 39:42.916
I'm going to say I'm
coming after all of them."

39:42.949 --> 39:46.585
- Why you out there saying
that people are coming after you?

39:46.619 --> 39:49.356
- You did the other day.

39:49.389 --> 39:51.623
- You've been making
a lot of jabs at me.

39:51.657 --> 39:54.927
It's like a bully.
- Stop it right now.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.528
<i>When I did that interview,</i>

39:56.563 --> 39:58.597
they asked me how's it
going, you know, with the girls?

39:58.630 --> 40:02.501
It was right after lip kit
launch so I was heated.

40:02.534 --> 40:05.771
- You came after me first.
- I didn't come after you.

40:05.804 --> 40:07.706
I said little things that
you were right next to me

40:07.740 --> 40:08.974
when I said them

40:09.900 --> 40:10.376
so they weren't like
coming after you.

40:10.409 --> 40:11.710
- No, no, no. No,
no, no, no. No.

40:11.744 --> 40:13.130
Here's my real
issue with Garcelle.

40:13.460 --> 40:15.382
If you've got a
problem, really voice it.

40:15.414 --> 40:16.849
But if you don't,

40:16.882 --> 40:20.452
don't come up with things
just to be provocative

40:20.487 --> 40:22.621
because you think that it
makes you more interesting.

40:22.655 --> 40:24.824
I thought you and I
moved past our issues.

40:24.858 --> 40:27.726
- Am I not allowed to
have my own opinion?

40:27.760 --> 40:29.561
- Of course, you are.
- Whether you like it or not.

40:29.596 --> 40:31.639
- I would love to
hear your opinion.

40:31.969 --> 40:31.998
- Can I have my opinion?
- 100% you can.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.666
- I love when people
have their opinions.

40:33.699 --> 40:35.099
- Everyone's allowed
to have their opinion.

40:35.349 --> 40:36.802
- It doesn't feel like because
my opinion only works if it--

40:36.835 --> 40:37.871
If it satisfies you.

40:37.903 --> 40:39.606
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:39.639 --> 40:41.940
- If it goes against
how you feel then it's,

40:41.974 --> 40:43.108
I can't have that opinion.

40:43.143 --> 40:45.744
- I speak four languages.
- Good for you.

40:45.778 --> 40:48.914
- And that doesn't make
sense in any one of 'em.

40:50.150 --> 40:51.479
<i>If you've got an issue</i>

40:51.480 --> 40:53.530
<i>or you think I talk
too much, tell me.</i>

40:53.860 --> 40:56.856
Don't mask it with a
passive aggressive comment.

40:56.889 --> 40:58.824
<i>It doesn't make any sense.</i>

41:09.768 --> 41:11.838
- Do we need to get
up and go over there?

41:17.177 --> 41:18.277
- I just wonder,

41:18.311 --> 41:21.547
do you genuinely feel like
anyone's coming after you?

41:21.581 --> 41:23.682
- Well, I felt like
you came after me

41:23.717 --> 41:25.952
and no one stood
up for me but you.

41:25.985 --> 41:27.820
- Oh, did you?
- Yeah.

41:27.853 --> 41:29.755
I'm going to help
because--because

41:29.789 --> 41:32.726
I'm just a bystander,
but I heard that you heard

41:32.759 --> 41:35.494
don't talk about this
but you were not there.

41:35.527 --> 41:37.931
- I was in the car.
- That is correct.

41:39.565 --> 41:40.900
- No one ever takes my side.

41:40.934 --> 41:42.100
<i>[dramatic sting]</i>

41:42.101 --> 41:45.672
- No one ever takes her side?
- Yeah.

41:45.704 --> 41:46.940
- I don't believe it's true

41:46.972 --> 41:49.107
that you're an
outsider in this group

41:49.108 --> 41:51.110
or people don't make an
effort. I don't believe that's true.

41:51.143 --> 41:53.780
- I said that's
how I feel. <i>If I say</i>

41:53.813 --> 41:56.715
I feel like I'm an
outsider, that's how I feel.

41:56.750 --> 41:58.851
<i>They could have had my
back but no one spoke up.</i>

41:58.885 --> 41:59.786
<i>No one said anything.</i>

41:59.818 --> 42:02.549
<i>That's one of the
things with Rinna.</i>

42:02.550 --> 42:04.556
<i>Although she wanted
to repair our friendship,</i>

42:04.590 --> 42:05.824
<i>she never stood up for me.</i>

42:05.858 --> 42:09.596
And where's Rinna? Sitting
down watching this all go down.

42:10.563 --> 42:13.132
- I think you may have to go
over there and chop some heads.

42:13.166 --> 42:15.135
- Not yet, do you
think? Not yet.

42:15.168 --> 42:19.739
<i>Garcelle got called out
for being jabby and shady.</i>

42:19.773 --> 42:23.610
If I feel there's
injustice going on,

42:23.643 --> 42:26.545
I will say something
but I don't.

42:26.579 --> 42:28.648
You're a big girl.
You can take Dorit.

42:28.681 --> 42:30.828
[laughs]

42:30.829 --> 42:31.751
- I'm going inside
to be with the girls.

42:31.784 --> 42:33.118
- Oh.
- Be with my wife.

42:33.119 --> 42:34.753
- You're going to be
very well from there.

42:34.788 --> 42:36.822
- I need some--I need
some female companionship.

42:36.856 --> 42:37.757
- Go in there, Harry.
- Yeah.

42:37.791 --> 42:39.893
<i>- Personally, I
wouldn't suggest it,</i>

42:39.925 --> 42:41.795
<i>but if you want to do it,
we're going to watch it, man.</i>

42:41.827 --> 42:43.463
<i>- I'm looking at
the body language.</i>

42:43.496 --> 42:45.979
- Go on, Harry.
- All right.

42:45.980 --> 42:47.199
- Don't go there,
Harry. It's not a mood.

42:48.268 --> 42:50.103
- Is it safe?
- No, it's not.

42:50.135 --> 42:51.971
[laughs] It's not.

42:52.500 --> 42:54.106
- Do I need to
be directly like--

42:54.139 --> 42:55.742
- Direct?

42:55.775 --> 42:57.976
- Probably.
- Maybe it's better to say--

42:58.110 --> 42:59.211
- Okay.
- You ----ing talk too much.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.679
Like let someone
else say something.

43:00.713 --> 43:01.914
- Absolutely.
- You got it.

43:01.947 --> 43:04.550
Like my God, will you shut up?

43:04.583 --> 43:05.485
- That's okay to say that.

43:05.518 --> 43:07.586
- You've never said
that. I welcome that.

43:07.619 --> 43:08.922
- Like, tell her to
shut up sometimes.

43:08.954 --> 43:10.255
- I mean, Dorit says
she wants the truth

43:10.289 --> 43:12.224
but can she handle the truth?

43:12.257 --> 43:15.494
I don't know but
I will be honest.

43:15.527 --> 43:16.829
Let's see how that goes.

43:16.862 --> 43:18.164
- I'm certainly not

43:18.197 --> 43:19.666
the only one in this
