16:20.897 --> 16:24.389
The body we found at the nuclear plant.
He's alive.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.414
According to the coroner's ofﬁce,

16:38.582 --> 16:40.413
AI Rothstein's body
was in the morgue all night,

16:42.752 --> 16:45.880
-JOE: Rothstein have a twin brother?
-Nope, only child.

16:46.089 --> 16:48.250
And get this,
the night the accelerator exploded,

16:48.425 --> 16:50.791
Rothstein was on his honeymoon in Hawaii.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.049
:D'lil

16:52.220 --> 16:54.962
So we're looking for a guy who's
really strong, can grow twice his size,

16:55.265 --> 16:57.756
and just happens to look exactly like
the guy he murdered?

16:58.268 --> 17:00.099
I would think this meta was really cool

17:00.270 --> 17:02.477
if everything about him
didn't just terrify me to my core.

17:03.565 --> 17:04.771
Is that what happened to you?

17:05.066 --> 17:06.647
You looked really spooked there
for a minute.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.479
Uh...

17:08.737 --> 17:11.444
I actually see the guy
that I can ask about it, right now.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.731
Call you back, okay? Hey.

17:14.284 --> 17:16.741
So, the hospital
next to the Flash Day rally?

17:17.120 --> 17:19.611
The X-ray and CT machines
all failed at once.

17:20.332 --> 17:21.572
Was that because of you?

17:21.791 --> 17:24.828
I did not do anything
that would cause that.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.793
I'm 92% sure.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.298
I'm gonna go make that 100. Excuse me.

17:32.677 --> 17:34.588
-(CLEARS THROAT)
-You okay?

17:35.138 --> 17:36.127
rum m I {I

17:37.307 --> 17:38.422
Okay.

17:41.478 --> 17:43.014
Bany can't do this alone anymore.

17:43.813 --> 17:44.848
(SIGHS)

17:45.106 --> 17:46.937
That's his plan, and I don't know
how to talk him out of it.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.141
At this point, I'm just trying not to
push him further away.

17:49.486 --> 17:53.354
Well, maybe Bany has been so successful
at pushing you, me and everyone else away

17:53.615 --> 17:56.482
because we keep letting him.
Let's not let him.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.317
What do you suggest?

17:59.162 --> 18:04.953
Well, if you keep getting no
for an answer, stop asking questions.

18:05.835 --> 18:09.794
-I say that. You quoting me to me?
-What can I say, you are a very smart man.

18:10.006 --> 18:11.291
(LAUGHS)

18:16.179 --> 18:18.170
(TY PING)

18:18.473 --> 18:21.681
So, this is what it looks like
inside Mercury Labs.

18:22.394 --> 18:24.680
Security here is way better
than it was at S.T.A.R. Labs,

18:24.854 --> 18:27.687
what, with people walking in and out
of the Cortex all the time.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.306
Hi, CiSOO.

18:29.526 --> 18:32.233
Sweet Sarek, is that a 6K proton splicer?

18:32.529 --> 18:36.363
Yes, it is. Dr. McGee insists on having
all the latest technology.

18:36.533 --> 18:37.648
I'll-Tl

18:38.702 --> 18:40.533
You deserve it. (LAUGHS)

18:41.204 --> 18:47.370
I spotted you at the rally today,
and I'm guessing you saw what happened.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.205
Cisco, I can't come back.

18:49.546 --> 18:53.209
Okay, check this out, we found this
on a victim at the nuclear power plant.

18:53.550 --> 18:57.418
But the badge shows absolutely nothing
at all, which is so weird.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.554
And what's also weird is that
at the same time that meta-human grew,

19:00.765 --> 19:03.427
all the X-ray machines
within a mile radius just went belly up.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.974
-Cisco...
-Just...

19:05.228 --> 19:08.561
If you could just see if the badge
was tampered with or something?

19:08.773 --> 19:12.982
I mean, if it's broken or whatever.
It would really help.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.063
(MOUTHING) Yes.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.243
MAN: Mr. Allen? Barry Allen?

19:29.085 --> 19:30.825
-Yeah.
-l'm Greg Turk.

19:31.463 --> 19:32.953
I'm an attorney at Weathersby and Stone.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.965
I don't usually make house calls, but
I've been trying to get in touch with you

19:37.260 --> 19:40.093
-for several months.
-Yes, yeah, I'm sony about that.

19:40.263 --> 19:43.300
I've just, um...
I've been really busy with police work.

19:43.641 --> 19:45.017
We need to talk about S.T.A.R. Labs.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.311
As you know, Harrison Wells

19:47.604 --> 19:49.686
left the property to you
as part of his living trust.

19:50.023 --> 19:55.313
Yeah, which I did not ask him to do,
but I've been keeping the place up.

19:55.820 --> 19:58.653
Well, it's gonna take more than cleaning
the ﬂoors to retain it, I'm afraid.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.148
The facility and the real estate
are scheduled to go into receivership

20:02.369 --> 20:03.449
WMEFM‘

20:04.204 --> 20:05.785
mm

20:07.540 --> 20:09.201
you watch this.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.668
-What is this?
-A video message drafted by Dr. Wells.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.130
-What's on it? Have you seen it?
-No.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.172
He was very speciﬁc.
It was only to be watched by you.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.295
The device will send me a notiﬁcation
after you've viewed it,

20:24.516 --> 20:26.677
and at that point,
I'll have everything ready to execute.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.306
-I'm not gonna watch that.
-Well, that's up to you, Mr. Allen.

20:31.022 --> 20:35.140
I'm only here to represent
Harrison Wells's ﬁnal request. Good day.

21:01.386 --> 21:02.421

21:09.394 --> 21:11.009
-What are you guys doing here?
-IRIS: Working.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.014
So, Caitlin was right.

21:13.231 --> 21:15.688
Yes, all humans contain
small amounts of radiation

21:15.900 --> 21:19.518
due to contact with cell phones,
microwaves, televisions, et cetera.

21:19.737 --> 21:21.693
L ”A. - - - - - 0-) o 010

21:21.865 --> 21:24.072
I think our meta's been sucking up
all the radiation around him

21:24.284 --> 21:25.524
and using it to power himself.

21:25.702 --> 21:28.535
Which is why the X-ray machines at the
hospital failed the day of the rally.

21:28.872 --> 21:31.705
So if we wanna ﬁnd him, we got to look
for places without radiation.

21:32.083 --> 21:34.790
All right, guys,
I don't want any of you here right now.

21:35.211 --> 21:37.793
Tough. You need your partners.
You need your friends.

21:38.047 --> 21:40.254
IRIS: Barry, everyone in this room
cares about you.

21:40.550 --> 21:42.211
But we also care about this city.

21:42.427 --> 21:44.884
We all wanna make a difference,
and that means ﬁghting meta-humans,

21:45.054 --> 21:46.635
and that means working with the Flash.

21:47.140 --> 21:49.552
You can't deny us that. Not anymore.

21:49.767 --> 21:53.100
Got him. There's a three-block dead zone
near a hazardous waste reclamation plant.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.429
It should be blooming with rads,
and right now it's at zero.

21:55.732 --> 21:58.565
That's where you'll ﬁnd
your Atom Smasher.

21:59.444 --> 22:00.479
:D'lil

22:00.820 --> 22:06.656
Because he absorbs atomic power and he,
well, smashes.

22:07.076 --> 22:08.236
Come here.

22:08.453 --> 22:09.488
(LAUGHS)

22:10.330 --> 22:12.821
-That's a great name. Welcome to the team.
-Thank you.

22:13.082 --> 22:16.290
Great. Guys, thank you.
You can go now, all right?

22:16.628 --> 22:20.792
Bany, you need to let Cisco and Stein
ﬁgure out a way to stop this guy.

22:21.466 --> 22:22.672
No, I don't.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.006
(SIGHS)

22:30.266 --> 22:35.477
Bany left his comm system behind.
We can't talk to him. He's on his own.

(SIGHS)

22:53.957 --> 22:54.946
MET

23:05.134 --> 23:07.386
Well, this is a curveball.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.631
I thought I was going to have to come
looking for you.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.463
I'm not gonna let you hurt anyone else.

23:12.684 --> 23:14.800
-I'm only here to hurt you, buddy.
-Yeah?

23:15.728 --> 23:18.390
Then why did you kill Albert Rothstein?
And why do you look like him?

23:18.856 --> 23:22.474
-You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
-(LAUGHS) Try me.

23:23.528 --> 23:24.643
I'm about to.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.561
Is there really no way of knowing
what's going on in there?

23:26.823 --> 23:28.188
I'm looking for the security cameras.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.194
Booyal

23:44.007 --> 23:45.668

23:54.183 --> 23:55.172
.IFFI

23:55.351 --> 23:57.182
-Maybe I can make it there.
-No, you won't.

23:57.395 --> 23:58.430
And what are you gonna do
when you get there?

23:58.605 --> 24:00.186
-The Boot didn't work on him.
-Alarm.

24:00.398 --> 24:02.514
-Believe me, we're all alarmed.
-No, the alarm system.

24:02.692 --> 24:04.683
You've tapped into
the surveillance cameras, correct?

24:04.902 --> 24:05.937

24:07.238 --> 24:09.354
Come on, feel the noise.

24:13.703 --> 24:15.864
He said you were some kind of big hero.

24:16.080 --> 24:19.038
But you don't seem worthy of him
or this city.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.456
(ALARM BLARING)

24:24.380 --> 24:27.417
Professor Stein, you are a genius.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.961
I believe
that's already been well established.

24:50.073 --> 24:51.609
Iris says mac and cheese is your favorite.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.568
I'm not hungry.

24:54.786 --> 24:57.448
It's been six months, Bany.
You got to eat, son.

24:59.791 --> 25:02.123
It's a good move,
being angry all the time.

25:02.460 --> 25:03.575
I get it.

25:03.795 --> 25:06.127
You miss your mom and dad, and you wanna
show them that you're strong.

25:06.464 --> 25:07.624
Being mad makes it easier.

25:08.966 --> 25:12.299
Tougher thing to do
would be to let yourself feel.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.930
It's okay to be sad.
You can be sad, Barry.

25:17.475 --> 25:21.309
Your parents will understand
if you're not strong all the time.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.849
That is why I'm here.

25:29.946 --> 25:31.937
It's okay, son. I got you.

Where is everyone?

26:02.812 --> 26:05.394

when you came to.

26:07.817 --> 26:08.897

26:13.489 --> 26:14.649
We're not gonna do this anymore.

26:15.241 --> 26:16.822
For the last six months,
I've given you your space

26:17.827 --> 26:19.988
to work all this out, come back to us.

26:21.205 --> 26:25.039
But today proved that
you'd rather just get yourself killed.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.331
(LAUGHS)

26:27.336 --> 26:28.667
It's better than
getting my friends killed.

26:30.173 --> 26:32.380
You want me to tell you
that it wasn't your fault?

26:33.676 --> 26:36.258
I can't. It was. Guess what?

26:36.888 --> 26:40.005
You weren't the only person
making decisions that day.

-Singularity thing.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.520
It's on all of us, Bany.

26:56.741 --> 26:59.733
So stop with this
hogging all the blame and regret.

We got to live with it.

27:06.918 --> 27:08.033
What do I do now?

27:10.463 --> 27:12.579
Well, I know that you've been

27:13.424 --> 27:15.585
rebuilding Central City at night.

27:17.386 --> 27:18.762
That's just bricks and paint.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.421
Maybe you should start trying to rebuild

27:23.976 --> 27:25.386
things that really matter.

27:40.576 --> 27:42.077
What are you doing here?

27:42.328 --> 27:45.411
Sony, I should've called or something.

27:45.623 --> 27:48.239
I just... I wanted to see you.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.666
{Emma

27:50.962 --> 27:56.252
Yeah, Cisco said that he saw you
at the Flash Day celebration.

27:56.592 --> 27:57.581
I was surprised.

27:58.803 --> 28:03.297
You better than anyone know that
I wasn't the hero that day.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.479
Bany, I know that you did
everything you could.

28:20.491 --> 28:22.106
It wasn't your fault.

28:23.786 --> 28:27.825
I don't blame you for Ronnie's death.
I blame myself.

28:28.165 --> 28:29.200

28:29.959 --> 28:31.290
Why?

28:31.794 --> 28:32.829
(SIGHS)

28:33.629 --> 28:37.668
When Ronnie ﬁrst became Firestorm,
he asked me to leave Central City

28:38.467 --> 28:40.628
and go somewhere
that we could have a normal life.

28:43.180 --> 28:44.215
And I said no.

28:45.850 --> 28:51.641
I couldn't leave S.T.A.R. Labs,
Dr. Wells, you.

28:53.316 --> 28:56.023
If I had gone with him,
Ronnie would still be alive.

28:57.737 --> 29:01.571
Being at S.T.A.R. Labs
just made think of that every single day.

29:03.993 --> 29:05.028
-Here.

Apparently, in the case of his death,
Wells had some kind of, um, living will.

29:26.182 --> 29:28.423
-And you haven't watched it yet?
-No.

29:29.393 --> 29:32.681
No, I've been too afraid.

29:34.857 --> 29:36.393
What if we watched it together?

All right.

29:48.704 --> 29:51.912
Hello, Barry. If you're watching this,

29:52.875 --> 29:55.082
that means
something has gone horribly wrong.

29:55.920 --> 30:00.254
I'm dead, and the last 15 years
have been for nothing.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.586
Bummer, 15 years.

You know what I realized?
In all those years helping raise you,

30:08.432 --> 30:10.093
we were never truly enemies, Barry.

30:10.726 --> 30:12.307
I'm not the thing you hate.

30:24.615 --> 30:27.903
Now, erase everything
I said up to this point.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.321
Give the following message to the police.

30:31.747 --> 30:33.328
My name is Harrison Wells.

30:34.291 --> 30:35.747
Being of sound mind and body,

30:36.085 --> 30:38.667
I ﬁeely confess to the murder
of Nora Allen in her home

30:38.963 --> 30:41.454
on the night of March 18th,
in the year 2000.

30:42.091 --> 30:44.082

30:53.102 --> 30:54.638
This is what I need to free my dad.

31:01.485 --> 31:05.194
Hey, Joe. Yeah. Hey, can you have
everybody meet me at S.T.A.R. Labs?

31:06.615 --> 31:09.152
Yeah. All right, thanks.
Yeah, all right, bye.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.380
-What's she saying?
-Hold on.

31:29.305 --> 31:31.796
Wells gave all the right details.
It's not a done deal yet,

31:32.058 --> 31:33.298
but the DA. says it looks good.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.187
Yeah, I'm here.

31:40.483 --> 31:41.518
Is it good news?

31:42.568 --> 31:44.229
-I think so.
-Henry's coming home?

31:44.862 --> 31:45.897

31:49.825 --> 31:54.694
Okay. Well, that still leaves
Atom Smasher to deal with.

31:55.539 --> 31:58.201
Last time you faced him,
it did not go well.

31:58.501 --> 32:00.037
No, it did not.

32:00.503 --> 32:04.496
I clearly can't stop him by myself.
So how are we gonna beat him?

32:06.342 --> 32:09.505
Well, ever since
I was shown a drained radiation tag,

32:10.054 --> 32:13.171
which I haven't been able
to stop thinking about, thank you, Cisco.

32:13.516 --> 32:14.722
You're welcome, Caitlin.

32:15.351 --> 32:18.843
If this guy likes radiation so much,
I say we give it to him.

What's up? I see you got my message.

32:43.796 --> 32:45.912
That light was perfect bait.
What made you think of that?

32:46.423 --> 32:48.630
I don't know, I think I saw it
in a comic book somewhere.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.752
You want me,
you're gonna have to catch me.

32:57.726 --> 32:59.466
It's working, dude.
Rothstein's following you.

32:59.770 --> 33:02.307
I must say,
he's quite agile for a man his size.

about to ﬂood that room...

won't be able to absorb it all.

I couldn't let you hurt anyone else.

Why did you wanna kill me?

who are no longer with us,

if in the morning,

38:07.119 --> 38:09.201
the two of us started looking
for an apartment for both of us?

38:09.455 --> 38:12.538
And Iris actually has been doing
some research on

38:13.208 --> 38:14.414
how to get your medical license back

38:14.626 --> 38:16.708
so you, uh, could start
your practice up again?

come work with us at S.T.A.R. Labs?

we can talk about all this tomorrow.

39:07.304 --> 39:09.135
Don't you have another family
in this room?

39:10.307 --> 39:11.922

fear the future anymore, right?
