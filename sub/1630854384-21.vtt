10:16.759 --> 10:18.127
Should I call Andi?

10:18.494 --> 10:20.629
No, no.
Let's just wait.

10:22.564 --> 10:23.766
Okay.

10:25.634 --> 10:26.602
I don't know.

10:27.069 --> 10:29.204
Maybe your African's money
didn't clear.

10:31.373 --> 10:32.541
It cleared.

10:34.543 --> 10:36.712
You're so confident in this guy.

10:38.213 --> 10:39.181
Calvin...

10:39.782 --> 10:41.216
So, you really like him?

10:44.219 --> 10:45.487
Yes, I do.

10:45.487 --> 10:50.559
[music]

10:50.559 --> 10:52.127
So, what does that mean for us?

10:56.965 --> 10:58.767
I mean, I been at your house.

I'm tryin' to figure out
all of this out.

11:14.116 --> 11:15.117
Are you sure?

11:17.386 --> 11:18.754
Yes, I am.

11:21.623 --> 11:23.725
Well, am I at least still
in the running?

11:26.028 --> 11:27.196
It's not a race.

11:28.530 --> 11:29.631
[Calvin] I know.

11:29.631 --> 11:31.900
But if you like this guy,

I mean...

11:36.538 --> 11:37.906
I just met him.

11:40.709 --> 11:42.344
He definitely likes you.

And that's on me.

11:47.015 --> 11:50.185
Yeah, he did give you
1.5 million dollars.

11:50.385 --> 11:51.987
He didn't give it to me.

11:52.621 --> 11:54.356
Sabrina, I'm pretty sure he did.

11:55.524 --> 11:56.959
It's for Maurice.

11:56.959 --> 12:00.195
He'll get it all back once
Maurice goes to court.

12:02.397 --> 12:03.365
Okay.

12:07.503 --> 12:08.737
What?

12:09.938 --> 12:12.307
I mean, come on, Sabrina.
That's a lotta risk.

12:15.611 --> 12:16.745
Okay.

12:17.779 --> 12:21.083
I like him, and he likes me.

12:24.086 --> 12:26.889

Well, I don't like it.

16:56.792 --> 16:58.761
Okay, well, what you want me
to do?

16:59.228 --> 17:00.496
I don't like that.

17:01.363 --> 17:03.399
Can you get somebody else
to help her?

17:05.634 --> 17:07.369
I'm sorry, this is stupid.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.371
I'm being so jealous.

you would be jealous, too.

17:18.948 --> 17:20.282
What?

17:21.884 --> 17:23.585
It's the way you put it on me.

17:24.920 --> 17:27.356
I don't want any other woman
gettin' that.

17:27.656 --> 17:28.724

Nah, please, it's okay.

17:47.876 --> 17:49.011
Look...

No, no, don't do that for me.

17:55.184 --> 17:58.220
It's fine.
It's really not a big deal.

18:05.794 --> 18:08.263
I don't want you worrying
about any of this, okay?

18:08.263 --> 18:09.765
Whenever she comes back in here,

18:09.765 --> 18:12.267
I'll just let her know I ain't
workin' on her case no more.

18:13.068 --> 18:14.003
All right?

18:14.003 --> 18:15.637
I'm so insecure.

18:16.171 --> 18:17.506
It's okay.

18:19.274 --> 18:20.709
Can I see you tonight?

18:21.410 --> 18:22.311

Hey, you want me to wait

Yeah.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.490
-[Andi]<i> Sabrina, you there?
</i>-[Sabrina]<i> Yeah.</i>

20:14.490 --> 20:15.190
So...

20:15.791 --> 20:18.193
Can y'all meet me
at Danni's after work?

20:18.794 --> 20:19.761
What's goin' on?

20:21.296 --> 20:23.599
I saw her there with Que.

20:24.433 --> 20:25.367
Que?

20:25.968 --> 20:27.236
The same Que?

20:27.436 --> 20:28.604
That's exactly right.

20:29.037 --> 20:29.938
Wow.

20:29.938 --> 20:31.173
Yeah, wow.

20:31.707 --> 20:32.708
Feels like college.

20:33.142 --> 20:34.276
Yep.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.177
Yeah, I know.

20:36.078 --> 20:38.847
Every time she gets worried,
she does somethin' like this.

20:38.847 --> 20:40.315
-I know.
-[Karen]<i> Well...</i>

20:40.315 --> 20:41.683
I'm comin', okay?

20:41.683 --> 20:42.851
Okay, thank you.

20:43.118 --> 20:44.319
All right, but I am...

20:44.319 --> 20:45.787
<i>about to have lunch, so...</i>

20:45.787 --> 20:46.889
I'll call y'all later?

20:46.889 --> 20:48.323
-Okay, I'll see you later.
-All right, bye.

20:48.323 --> 20:49.892
-Bye.
-[Andi]<i> Bye!</i>

20:51.160 --> 20:52.194
'Kay.

20:52.194 --> 21:04.339
[music]

21:05.240 --> 21:06.808
Come in.

21:08.076 --> 21:09.278
-Hi.
-[Andi] Hi.

21:09.278 --> 21:10.546
Gary's here for you.

21:10.913 --> 21:12.214
Okay, perfect.

21:12.214 --> 21:13.715
Should I send him back?

21:13.715 --> 21:14.716
Yes, please.

21:14.716 --> 21:15.951
-All right.
-[Andi] Thank you.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.221
Oh...

21:31.467 --> 21:33.236
Y'all are playin' games.

21:33.236 --> 21:34.237
[Fatima] Excuse me?

21:34.237 --> 21:35.772
I don't like this shit!

21:36.806 --> 21:37.974
Heather, what are you
talkin' about?

21:37.974 --> 21:39.208
You're playin' games!

21:39.208 --> 21:40.276
What?

21:40.276 --> 21:41.411
He said he would represent me,

21:41.411 --> 21:43.079
then he said that he
wouldn't?

21:43.079 --> 21:44.047
Uh...

21:44.047 --> 21:45.214
Heather, I don't...

21:45.214 --> 21:47.016
know what you're talking about?

21:47.016 --> 21:47.950
Okay...

21:48.951 --> 21:51.187
[Fatima] I didn't say
you could sit down.

21:51.187 --> 21:53.423
Okay.
I called Zac.

21:54.157 --> 21:55.458
Okay?

21:55.458 --> 21:57.727
I was gonna meet with him
and the lawyer.

21:58.795 --> 22:01.297
Okay, well, you can meet with
Zac if you want to.

22:01.297 --> 22:03.266
Well, the lawyer dropped me.

22:04.567 --> 22:06.235
Heather, you don't need him.

22:06.602 --> 22:08.404
Look, Zac is a fair man.

22:08.404 --> 22:10.306
Okay, well I'mma get
another lawyer.

22:10.306 --> 22:11.507
Okay.

22:11.507 --> 22:13.209
You can do that if
you want to...

22:13.509 --> 22:14.744
But Zac has a lot of money,

22:14.744 --> 22:16.979
and he can keep that shit
tied up in court

22:16.979 --> 22:18.314
for a long time.

22:18.948 --> 22:19.916
And guess what?

22:20.650 --> 22:23.419
You won't get any money
for a long time.

22:24.087 --> 22:25.254
Well...

22:27.356 --> 22:28.491
[Fatima] Look.

22:29.459 --> 22:30.593
If you're smart...

22:31.561 --> 22:32.829
you'll just talk to him

22:32.829 --> 22:34.430
and see what you guys
can figure out,

22:34.797 --> 22:36.632
instead of tryin' to go
this route.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.268
You think he'll do that?

22:40.002 --> 22:41.671
Did you ever ask?

22:42.171 --> 22:43.372
Well...

22:44.807 --> 22:45.775
Look.

22:45.775 --> 22:48.177
One thing I know,
Zac's a good man,

22:48.177 --> 22:49.912
and he's gonna take care
of his kids.

22:51.314 --> 22:53.382
So, you think I should
meet up with him?

22:54.984 --> 22:56.219
I think...

22:56.219 --> 22:57.854
you should do whatever
you wanna do.

22:58.721 --> 23:00.923
Well, I called him,
he ain't answer.

23:01.824 --> 23:02.825
Okay.

23:03.326 --> 23:04.560
So?

23:05.428 --> 23:06.429
Tell you what.

23:06.929 --> 23:09.665
Come to my house tonight.
I'll text you the time.

23:10.266 --> 23:11.501
Are you sure?

23:11.501 --> 23:12.535
[Fatima] Yeah.

23:12.535 --> 23:13.870
Will he be there?

23:14.670 --> 23:15.671
No.

23:15.671 --> 23:17.573
The ghost of Zac's
past'll be there.

23:17.573 --> 23:19.575
You funny.
Ha-ha.

23:19.575 --> 23:21.577
Yes, he'll be there, Heather.

23:25.314 --> 23:26.382
Okay.

23:26.382 --> 23:27.550
All right.

23:27.550 --> 23:29.218
I'll see you later.

23:29.218 --> 23:39.128
[music]

23:39.128 --> 23:40.096
Gotcha.

23:43.366 --> 23:45.835
I am a bad bitch.

23:46.169 --> 23:58.114
[music]

23:59.749 --> 24:00.850
Come in!

24:03.352 --> 24:04.887
-Hi!
-[Gary] Hey...

24:08.291 --> 24:09.358
How are you?

24:09.792 --> 24:12.662
-I'm good, how are you?
-Good, I'm good.

24:14.030 --> 24:14.997
What's up?

24:15.698 --> 24:18.034
Just wanted to see if you were
free for dinner tonight.

24:19.235 --> 24:21.571
You usually call me
about dinner.

24:22.572 --> 24:24.140
Yeah, well...

24:24.574 --> 24:25.942
I figured...

24:26.509 --> 24:27.610
I was in the area...

24:27.610 --> 24:28.844
Uh-huh, and...
Oh!

24:28.844 --> 24:32.281
[Gary] So, thought
I'd stop by.

24:32.281 --> 24:33.950
-[Andi] You did?
-[Gary] Mm-hm.

24:33.950 --> 24:34.850
-You know...
-Wow.

24:34.850 --> 24:37.453
[Gary] I...
was actually...

24:37.453 --> 24:38.821
What was that?

24:39.922 --> 24:41.023
What was what?

24:41.490 --> 24:44.694
Oh, you coming and
hugging me at, at work,

24:44.694 --> 24:47.096
and being all touchy-feely.

24:47.096 --> 24:48.497
Like, what was that?

24:49.565 --> 24:52.501
What, are you tryin' to see
if Robin sees you?

24:52.501 --> 24:54.637
Robin?
Nobody worried about no Robin.

24:55.471 --> 24:57.006
Are you sure?
'Cause...

24:57.406 --> 24:59.609
He's not even here, so...

25:00.309 --> 25:02.011
Oh, he's not here...

25:02.878 --> 25:03.879
Okay.

25:03.879 --> 25:04.914
I mean...

25:04.914 --> 25:06.716
I'm not worried about Robin,
so...

25:07.917 --> 25:08.985
[Andi] Look, Gary.

25:09.585 --> 25:12.255
I don't wanna be a part of
your childish games.

25:12.822 --> 25:14.590
What're you talkin' about?

25:16.392 --> 25:17.860
Did you tell him?

25:18.461 --> 25:19.595
Tell him what?

25:19.595 --> 25:21.631
Did you tell him I was
in this with you?

25:21.631 --> 25:23.232
Andi, in what?

25:23.232 --> 25:24.333
[Andi] Gary...

25:24.333 --> 25:25.735
Don't play games with me.

25:25.735 --> 25:27.336
-I'm not.
-I am not dealing with this!

25:27.336 --> 25:29.639
Okay, we've been here and
we've done that.

25:29.639 --> 25:32.441
And I've already told you,
you're on thin ice, okay?

25:32.441 --> 25:33.843
Okay!
I know.

25:33.843 --> 25:35.578
Okay, well stop playin' games!

25:35.578 --> 25:36.812
I'm not!
Look, look...

25:36.812 --> 25:38.247
I'm...
Okay, I'm sorry.

25:38.247 --> 25:39.315
I'm sorry.

25:39.315 --> 25:41.317
Okay?
I'll be better.

25:41.317 --> 25:42.785
I'm sorry.

25:42.785 --> 25:43.719
Stop it!

25:43.719 --> 25:45.554
You look great.
I'm sorry.

25:45.554 --> 25:46.656
All right?

25:46.656 --> 25:48.391
Okay.
We're in a good place.

25:48.391 --> 25:49.992
-[Gary] Yeah.
-Don't go back there.

25:49.992 --> 25:51.727
Okay, so...

25:52.595 --> 25:54.063
Can I see you tonight?

25:58.968 --> 26:00.169
I'll let you know.

26:00.169 --> 26:01.404
All right.

26:01.404 --> 26:02.738
[Andi] All right.

26:03.339 --> 26:04.774
Oh...

26:05.441 --> 26:07.610
I'm gonna be back at
the office here

26:07.610 --> 26:09.912
at five to meet with them, so...

26:09.912 --> 26:12.682
Just so you know,
it's not about you.

26:12.682 --> 26:14.050
It's not about me?

26:14.050 --> 26:15.251
-[Gary] No.
-Okay.

26:15.251 --> 26:16.452
Okay?

26:16.452 --> 26:17.920
And you didn't tell him?

26:18.487 --> 26:19.522
I didn't tell him anything.

26:19.522 --> 26:21.390
Okay.
All right.

26:21.390 --> 26:22.892

Come here.

26:25.194 --> 26:26.562
Give me a kiss.

26:30.366 --> 26:31.534
-Okay...
-I'll see you later.

26:31.534 --> 26:32.768
-I got makeup on you.
-It's all right.

26:32.768 --> 26:33.936
-Don't worry about it.
-I'm sorry.

26:33.936 --> 26:34.870
All right.

26:35.705 --> 26:37.173
Take it to the dry cleaners.

26:45.848 --> 26:55.958
[music]

26:56.258 --> 26:57.226
Home!

26:58.361 --> 27:00.930
I am finally home!

27:02.164 --> 27:03.699
Oh, shit!

27:04.633 --> 27:08.637
[Sabrina] Oh my God.
Oh my God.

27:10.506 --> 27:12.041
Calvin?

27:15.544 --> 27:17.179
[stuttering]
Calvin?

27:18.381 --> 27:19.915
Where's all of my shit?

27:20.383 --> 27:22.251
Punk-ass -- Que!

27:22.251 --> 27:23.552
What?

27:25.020 --> 27:26.222
He robbed us.

27:26.222 --> 27:27.456
He -- robbed us.

27:27.456 --> 27:28.724
Are you kidding me?

27:34.163 --> 27:35.197
Calvin...

27:36.165 --> 27:37.733
You let Que in my house?

27:38.367 --> 27:40.236
-Maurice...
-[Maurice] No.

27:40.870 --> 27:41.937
Tell me.

27:43.272 --> 27:44.673
Tell him.

27:45.708 --> 27:47.710
What the hell is goin' on?

27:47.943 --> 27:48.978
Tell me!

27:49.945 --> 27:51.847
Calvin tried to stop him.

27:52.548 --> 27:53.749
What?

27:54.850 --> 27:57.653
You little bitch-ass --.

27:57.653 --> 27:58.788
[Sabrina] Maurice.

27:58.788 --> 27:59.855
[Maurice] No!

27:59.855 --> 28:01.857
All my shit is gone!
Look!

28:03.726 --> 28:04.994
Well, you...

28:05.528 --> 28:07.163
-You let him in here...
-Don't.

28:07.563 --> 28:08.731
Remind me.

28:08.731 --> 28:11.700
Well...
Don't blame it on Calvin.

28:12.601 --> 28:15.504
Calvin, you let him in my house?

28:16.305 --> 28:18.374
He was here when I came home
from work,

28:18.374 --> 28:19.842
and I tried to stop him.

28:20.843 --> 28:22.945
And you weren't man enough
to get him out?

28:22.945 --> 28:24.613
-Don't...do that.
-Really, Maurice?

28:25.347 --> 28:26.382
What did you do?

28:26.816 --> 28:29.185
Another -- twirl
to the ground?

28:29.185 --> 28:30.586
-Please, please.
-All right, you know what?

28:30.586 --> 28:31.954
A death drop this time?

28:31.954 --> 28:33.856
All right, I'm not doin'
this shit with you.

28:34.924 --> 28:38.694
[Maurice] I have come home
to nothing!

28:39.795 --> 28:42.031
I've gone from one nightmare
to another.

28:42.031 --> 28:44.166
Well, if you wanna be honest,
you created your own nightmare.

28:44.166 --> 28:45.100
Don't you -- dare.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.402
No, I'mma tell you somethin'...

28:46.402 --> 28:48.137
You tell me shit!

28:49.004 --> 28:50.206
Stop.

28:50.206 --> 28:51.240
Now.

28:52.241 --> 28:53.309
You know what?

28:53.742 --> 28:55.945
I don't even know why I let
you live here.

28:55.945 --> 28:57.847
So, what?
You blamin' all this shit on me?

28:57.847 --> 28:59.215
[Maurice] Yes!

28:59.215 --> 29:00.916
100%.

29:06.388 --> 29:07.723
I think I'm gonna take a walk.

29:07.723 --> 29:09.124
Yeah, you do that!

29:09.425 --> 29:11.160
You -- do that!

29:14.196 --> 29:15.264
[door slamming]

29:18.559 --> 29:20.161
Shit.

29:20.628 --> 29:22.029
-Maurice...
-No!

29:22.396 --> 29:24.131
-Shit.
-[Sabrina] Just...

29:24.131 --> 29:25.967
-Please try to listen to me...
-[Maurice] Don't...

29:25.967 --> 29:28.970
-[Sabrina] [unintelligible]
- ...do that with me right now.

29:31.539 --> 29:32.640
He tried...

29:32.640 --> 29:34.775
He tried to put him out.

29:34.775 --> 29:36.010
Guess what, Sabrina?

29:36.010 --> 29:38.980
He's a man.
He should have got him out.

29:40.948 --> 29:44.552
Well, he beat him.
He beat him with a golf club.

29:44.552 --> 29:47.355
And he almost killed him
for you.

29:48.055 --> 29:48.856
What?

29:48.856 --> 29:50.424
[Sabrina]<i> </i>Yeah.

29:50.424 --> 29:51.759
I was there.

29:55.529 --> 29:56.831
Calvin did that?

29:57.264 --> 29:58.399
Yes.

30:00.167 --> 30:01.235
Shit.

30:04.071 --> 30:07.074
I know Que's back has to be
hurting right now.

30:08.309 --> 30:09.410
Damn.

30:12.346 --> 30:14.915
But you need to
take some responsibility.
