WEBVTT

00:26.568 --> 00:27.610
On your right.

00:31.489 --> 00:34.534
- Is that an SLR 9?
- Sure is.

00:34.534 --> 00:37.287
That's crazy. I used to have one of those.

00:37.287 --> 00:40.498
- Yeah?
- I don't do carbon anymore, though.

00:40.498 --> 00:42.792
Aluminum is just the king.

00:42.792 --> 00:45.503
Yeah, I was thinking
about making the switch.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.214
How far you headed?

00:48.214 --> 00:51.593
- Just down Old Topanga and back.
- Oh, word, me too.

00:51.593 --> 00:55.180
- It's nice to have a riding partner today.
- Definitely.

00:56.389 --> 00:57.766
I'm George, by the way.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.560
Hey. I'm Zane.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.239
Ugh. Fucking house arrest,
and now this?

01:13.865 --> 01:16.659
I can't believe I got shingles
on top of everything else.

01:16.659 --> 01:18.453
It's stress, dude.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.663
Power of the mind. Mind over matter.

01:20.663 --> 01:23.792
- It's the power of herpes.
- Shut the fuck up, Bobby.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.668
Yo, herpes zoster.

01:25.668 --> 01:27.629
Stop saying "herpes."
- It's chicken pox.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.714
Not everything is science.
It helps to relax.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.842
Relax? Thanks, Michael.
How am I supposed to relax?

01:32.842 --> 01:36.763
They got me crossing state lines,
grand larceny, assault. I'm fucked.

01:36.763 --> 01:38.723
- I'm fucked, dude.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.269
It's your cousin.

01:43.269 --> 01:46.606
Don't be all welcoming and shit.
I want him to feel bad.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.320
Yo, long time, man. Sick beanie, bro.

01:54.906 --> 01:55.740
Fuck you.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.326
- Okay.
Hey, Danny.

01:58.326 --> 02:00.245
Come on in. Nice to see you.

02:00.745 --> 02:03.790
I'm going to prison for the both of us,
and that's what you brought?

02:03.790 --> 02:05.458
- Sara Lee pound cake?
- I--

02:05.458 --> 02:07.168
I just made a quick stop.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.795
Whatever. Cut the shit up.

02:08.795 --> 02:11.965
Thick slices.
Put it in the microwave for 15 seconds.

02:12.590 --> 02:14.092
Okay. What the...?

02:14.092 --> 02:15.552
You think there's gluten in here?

02:15.552 --> 02:17.345
The whole fucking thing is gluten.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.353
Hey, you know,

02:25.353 --> 02:27.564
I tried to tell the cops
it wasn't all you,

02:27.564 --> 02:28.982
but they wouldn't believe me.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.359
- Yeah? You told the cops?
- I did. Like--

02:31.359 --> 02:35.572
They knew the truck and business
were under your name, so it's like...

02:35.572 --> 02:38.408
None of this would've went down
if you didn't steal a fridge.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.994
Who registers a mini fridge?
What the fuck?

02:40.994 --> 02:44.164
None of it would've went down
if your brother didn't steal the truck.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.457
This is that plant bitch's fault.

02:46.457 --> 02:49.502
Yeah? The plant bitch,
will she pay my legal fees?

02:49.502 --> 02:51.254
Pay back the 20K you owe me?

02:51.254 --> 02:54.841
I got to thinking,
"There's no way this bitch is self-made."

02:54.841 --> 02:57.135
All that bragging about
pouring milk into mouths?

02:57.135 --> 03:00.722
- Shut up, liar. What are you talking--?
- The fuck are you talking about?!

03:00.722 --> 03:03.224
The plant bitch, the milk,
what are you talking about?

03:03.224 --> 03:07.020
It always fucked with me
she wasn't married to some white dude.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.187
And guess what,

03:08.187 --> 03:12.525
her husband is the son
of a big Japanese artist.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.569
Dude, she married into art money.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.864
They got all this crazy shit
we could steal.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.450
No, for real.
He told me all about his father's pieces.

03:21.534 --> 03:26.372
- You're hanging out with the husband now?
- Don't worry, I didn't tell my real name.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.124
I introduced myself as Zane.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.001
Oh!
Fuck.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.962
You're out there doing fucking cosplay?!

03:34.589 --> 03:38.092
Here's what you'll do.
You'll finish working at the church,

03:38.092 --> 03:41.054
and then I'll cash that check.
I'm gonna cash it!

03:41.638 --> 03:43.806
You work, I cash.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.309
And then I'm gonna keep cashing.

03:46.309 --> 03:50.897
I'll keep cashing till I can pay off
the lawyer to keep me out of jail, okay?

03:50.897 --> 03:52.106
Is that cool?

03:52.690 --> 03:54.317
Does that work for you?

03:56.819 --> 03:58.029
You see that?

03:58.738 --> 04:01.366
I was there. K-Town riots.
Just off of frame.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.244
If they just used the wider lens,
I'd be in the history books.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.164
Oh, fuck, dude, this is good.

04:08.706 --> 04:09.791
You guys try this?

04:10.667 --> 04:12.669
This shit is so heavy, bro.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.962
Fuck this job.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.549
What the fuck, Bobby?
What did I tell you about the gun, dude?

04:18.549 --> 04:20.760
What?
- Come on, this is a church.

04:20.760 --> 04:23.680
- Put it in the car.
- Relax. I forgot.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.723
Remember Dick?
Remember him and his friend?

04:25.723 --> 04:28.726
I don't know any Dicks, bro.
Who's naming their kid Dick anymore?

04:28.726 --> 04:31.437
The former vice president Dick Cheney
is who I'm talking about, dude.

04:31.437 --> 04:34.190
He shot his friend
in the fucking face, dude.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.109
Fine. I'll put it in the car.

04:36.109 --> 04:38.278
Did you ever hear
of the Harvard crow study?

04:38.278 --> 04:40.571
- I got waitlisted at Harvard.
- I know.

04:40.571 --> 04:44.367
They put this dude in a Dick Cheney mask
and he was mean to these crows,

04:44.367 --> 04:45.868
and the crows talked to other crows.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.162
All over the country,
no matter where Cheney was,

04:48.162 --> 04:49.872
crows would attack his ass.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.583
They'd be chirping at his face,
just pecking him and shit.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.504
I got into UT Austin as well.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.214
Dope.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.883
Yo, thanks for helping with this, guys.

05:00.883 --> 05:02.927
We're just here to get paid, man.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.805
Not paid enough, right?
- Know what I mean?

05:05.805 --> 05:09.934
Hey, I heard you guys started
working for Isaac about two years ago.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.478
Is that what he said?
Working for him, not with him?

05:12.478 --> 05:14.605
He's been doing that since we were kids,

05:14.605 --> 05:17.859
telling you that you're equals,
but he always ends up being the alpha.

05:17.859 --> 05:20.570
- He wishes he was alpha.
- Dude's not even a beta.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.948
Yeah, no, he's like zeta.
Catherine Zeta-Jones.

05:23.948 --> 05:24.949
What?

05:26.951 --> 05:27.869
Cool.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.996
Yeah. Yeah, dude's got no vision.

05:29.996 --> 05:34.125
Yeah, I got vision, though.
Just no one can see my vision but me.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.835
Yo, your art heist idea?

05:36.336 --> 05:37.628
- Fucking <i>fuego</i>.
- Yup.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.838
Thanks, man.

05:38.838 --> 05:40.882
She upgraded her security system,

05:40.882 --> 05:42.800
but I got in before, I can get in again.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.927
What did you steal last time?

05:44.927 --> 05:46.137
Oh. Uh...

05:47.430 --> 05:48.473
I, uh...

05:50.183 --> 05:52.018
I pissed all over her bathroom.

05:52.018 --> 05:53.936
Like, gallons.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.313
Very cool.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.316
I told her I was a contractor
and walked right in.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.319
Yo, we could say we're contractors.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.236
Yup.

06:02.236 --> 06:05.615
Nah, I already did that one,
so, you know...

06:05.615 --> 06:08.284
Well, you know, but there's no bad ideas.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.453
I'm not like Isaac.
This is a three-way street.

06:11.412 --> 06:12.955
What did you have in mind?

06:16.375 --> 06:19.212
- Zane, my man.
- Yo.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.131
Thanks for coming, man.
I know it was short notice.

06:22.131 --> 06:23.883
Man, thanks for having me.

06:23.883 --> 06:28.012
I normally have to lead praise band
rehearsal, but I have a day off.

06:29.680 --> 06:32.391
I know you.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.645
- Sorry. She's weird around new people.
- Oh, no, it's...

06:35.645 --> 06:36.896
Come on in.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.901
Oh, man, beautiful home.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.112
This is a timeless kitchen, man.

06:44.654 --> 06:45.988
Ah. Thanks, Zane.

06:47.573 --> 06:48.491
I know you.

06:49.534 --> 06:53.496
Sweetie, we don't do that. Okay?
That's not how we greet new guests.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.957
One sec, let me get her some candy.

06:55.957 --> 06:59.627
- Oh, hey, I have some Skittles.
- Oh, you do? In your pocket?

07:00.378 --> 07:01.712
Got a sweet tooth.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.173
Can I have some, please?

07:04.173 --> 07:07.176
If Zane gives you some,
are you gonna stop saying "I know you"?

07:08.261 --> 07:10.847
I always keep a bag in my truck,

07:10.847 --> 07:14.433
- so any time, just ask. Okay?
- Okay.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.773
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Yeah. Straight down to the left.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.983
Thanks.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.451
Uh, don't shoot the messenger,

07:31.451 --> 07:34.537
but I think there's a leak
in your plumbing.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.540
I heard some trickling behind the tiles.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.333
Fudge sundae.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.003
- Really?
- Yeah, I think so.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.630
Shoot.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.842
Well, I gotta call Amy.

07:47.842 --> 07:51.429
- She handles all the house stuff.
- Dude, we can handle this.

07:51.429 --> 07:53.848
You know what? Let's do some research.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.309
- I'll do the research.
- No, it's too much trouble.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.352
Not a problem at all. I'm on it.

07:58.352 --> 08:01.355
- Really?
- Yeah. Looking up plumbers right now.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.149
Thanks, man. You're the best.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.818
Yo, best recognize best.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.070
- Hey.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.824
Nice. Danny just texted
a list of shit to buy.

08:11.824 --> 08:15.536
This is what I'm talking about, man.
Finally, a fucking plan.

08:16.496 --> 08:17.872
- Yo.
- Yo?

08:17.872 --> 08:20.166
Overalls. That's the move.

08:20.166 --> 08:23.252
No, bro. Farmers wear overalls, dude.

08:25.254 --> 08:28.674
- So do plumbers.
- No, they don't. This ain't a video game.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.846
- Where you see a farmer at?
- I went apple picking a couple weeks ago.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.806
Let's buy this shit.

08:36.724 --> 08:37.558
All right.

08:38.476 --> 08:40.311
This is where it all goes down.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.939
Wow. Very cool.

08:45.441 --> 08:46.359
What are those?

08:48.903 --> 08:49.862
Oh, uh...

08:50.363 --> 08:52.740
Those are my late father's pieces.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.076
Right. I remember you mentioning him.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.411
- Right.
- This just returned from the gallery.

08:57.411 --> 09:00.039
- Tamago, the Holy Grail.
Wow.

09:03.543 --> 09:06.003
No offense to your dad, um,

09:06.003 --> 09:11.801
but, I don't know, these pieces
kind of feel like a little out of a place,

09:11.801 --> 09:17.181
compared to all the crazy, creative stuff
you got going on everywhere else.

09:18.015 --> 09:18.849
Really?

09:18.849 --> 09:24.981
Yeah, I mean, like, this is what I imagine
when I hear about fine art, you know?

09:26.023 --> 09:27.608
Makes me feel like...

09:28.734 --> 09:31.362
I don't know how to describe it.
I'm not good at this shit.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.531
There's no bad way of interpreting art.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.200
Say whatever comes to mind.

09:39.412 --> 09:42.540
I mean, you know,
I don't know if it's right, but...

09:44.667 --> 09:48.129
Uh, I don't know, it kind of makes me...

09:49.380 --> 09:50.214
feel sad.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.093
Gives me like a...

09:54.093 --> 09:56.554
a sticky feeling inside,

09:57.096 --> 10:01.434
I don't know,
like in my chest, in my legs.

10:01.976 --> 10:05.646
I don't know, I'm just, like,
going off the top of my head.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.775
Wow, um...

10:10.651 --> 10:13.279
You okay? Did I do that wrong? That was--

10:13.279 --> 10:15.906
No, no. You did great. Um...

10:16.949 --> 10:17.867
I don't know,

10:18.618 --> 10:22.788
sometimes I just feel like a fraud,
you know?

10:23.372 --> 10:26.876
- Hmm.
- When my dad passed away,

10:27.627 --> 10:32.131
my first thought was,
"I wonder if he died disappointed."

10:34.091 --> 10:36.636
No one ever told me otherwise, so, um...

10:39.013 --> 10:41.891
That was really nice.
Thank you, thank you.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.852
Yeah, no problem, man.
I mean, you got the gift.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.650
I'm so glad I met you, man.

10:51.984 --> 10:54.111
I've been kind of lonely lately.

10:54.111 --> 10:57.448
My wife's been so busy making
all these big life decisions without me.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.409
I know we just met,

11:01.535 --> 11:03.788
but I feel like you actually care.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.082
You're a good person.

11:07.708 --> 11:09.835
I have a good sense about these things.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.045
Thanks, man.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.805
I gotta make a quick call, if that's cool?

11:20.805 --> 11:23.557
- Yeah. Yes, please. Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.482
<i>Yo, Danny. What's up?</i>
- Michael.

11:31.482 --> 11:34.944
Hey, dude, plan's off. Okay?
I don't have time to explain.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.862
<i>What? Did you do the leak?</i>

11:36.862 --> 11:39.323
Yeah, but there's nothing
worth stealing here.

11:39.323 --> 11:42.910
<i>- They got a TV, though, don't they?</i>
- Yeah, they have a TV.

11:42.910 --> 11:46.705
- But just forget it, okay?
<i>- We already got all the stuff, man.</i>

11:46.705 --> 11:49.250
- What do you mean? Just put it back.
<i>- It's in the cart.</i>

11:49.250 --> 11:51.585
<i>- You can't put it back. It's rude.</i>
- It's not rude.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.338
<i>Dude, if you won't do it, then we will.
Send me her address.</i>

11:54.338 --> 11:57.508
- No, I am not giving you their address.
<i>- Don't make us look it up. We'll find it.</i>

11:57.508 --> 11:58.884
We're not robbing this house.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.845
-<i>Come on. Dude!</i>
- End of story.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.473
Plan's off.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.309
- Fucking Chos, man.
- Yeah.

12:08.644 --> 12:09.687
So, what now?

12:13.274 --> 12:15.860
Listen for trickling water.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.077
Hi. Can I help you?

12:25.077 --> 12:26.579
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

12:26.579 --> 12:29.206
<i>We were just driving by
in the neighborhood,</i>

12:29.206 --> 12:32.209
<i>- and we noticed-- We're plumbers.
- We're plumbers.</i>

12:32.209 --> 12:35.254
<i>We noticed that you might
have a little water leak.</i>

12:36.380 --> 12:39.884
- You guys are good. How'd you know?
<i>You could have a pinhole leak.</i>

12:39.884 --> 12:42.386
<i>- It's caused by heavy minerals.</i>
<i>Yup.</i>

12:42.386 --> 12:45.014
<i>And I gotta tell you,
as professionals, it's not safe.</i>

12:45.014 --> 12:48.184
<i>There could be dangerous mold
growing in there right now.</i>

12:48.184 --> 12:52.980
<i>We recommend you get out immediately,
so we can take care of it, if you'd like.</i>

12:52.980 --> 12:58.068
You know, I appreciate all the info,
but I'm gonna get a second opinion.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.571
<i>Uh, there's two of us, so...</i>

13:00.571 --> 13:04.283
<i>I have an opinion, he's got one.
There's two of them there.</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:07.077
- I'm sure. Thank you, guys. Take care.
<i>The longer you wait,</i>

13:07.077 --> 13:08.996
<i>- the worse it's gonna get.</i>
<i>Way worse.</i>

13:10.039 --> 13:12.625
I could totally tell
they were scamming me.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.045
So I watched a few videos,
I bought a few fans,

13:16.045 --> 13:18.631
and then I turned off the water valve.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.924
All by myself.

13:22.593 --> 13:24.553
There might be some mold, though,

13:24.553 --> 13:28.390
so we'll have to call some people in
to come test it while we're away.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.392
What?

13:32.978 --> 13:37.691
Oh. I found us an Airbnb in Ojai.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.110
Ojai!

13:42.446 --> 13:44.698
Amy's gonna meet us after work.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.370
I know.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.540
I wish it could be us going instead.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.668
Stop it.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.628
I miss you too.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.924
Okay, okay. Well, I gotta go.
I gotta clean up.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.218
I'll call you when I come back, okay?

14:04.802 --> 14:06.095
I love you too.

14:08.889 --> 14:09.932
Bye, Mia.

14:11.809 --> 14:15.229
Well, think about me.
I can't wait until you get back. Bye.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.776
Uh, excuse me?

14:21.652 --> 14:23.904
Oh, my gosh. Mrs. Nakai.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.364
Okay. Yeah.

14:27.074 --> 14:29.618
Amy should be right out, like any second.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.539
I'm Mia, by the way.

14:34.039 --> 14:37.668
I don't think we've ever met,
but we've spoken over the phone.

14:37.668 --> 14:41.088
I haven't been here in a while.
Is it always like this?

14:41.088 --> 14:42.840
Sorry for the mess.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.925
A bunch of people just quit.

14:44.925 --> 14:49.889
The acquisition news got out,
and everyone's looking for jobs.

14:49.889 --> 14:53.350
Chaos always follows my daughter-in-law
wherever she goes.

14:53.350 --> 14:56.186
I guess that's why her and George
make such a great pair.

14:56.186 --> 15:00.441
It's almost like a yin-yang, right?

15:01.650 --> 15:03.277
Are my son's vases selling?

15:03.277 --> 15:07.072
Oh. You know, I think what's happening
is people are admiring them--

15:07.072 --> 15:11.118
Even the most imaginative vases,
like the '70s Scheurich Fat Lavas,

15:11.118 --> 15:13.370
were limited to red or brown glazes.

15:13.370 --> 15:15.915
The abstract nature of Joji's vases

15:15.915 --> 15:18.792
reflect the state of emergence
he's participating in.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.587
Oh, my God.
Don't get me started on Fat Lavas.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.381
That's what you should say
to the customers.

15:24.381 --> 15:25.507
Right.

15:26.216 --> 15:29.845
I was just talking to George about
his glazing techniques the other day.

15:29.845 --> 15:33.015
I admire the artistry
in your family so much.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.851
So if you ever need an assistant

15:35.851 --> 15:38.395
or know of any galleries hiring, I'd be--

15:38.395 --> 15:42.483
- Is there a restroom nearby?
- Oh. Yeah. It's right around the corner.

15:51.700 --> 15:55.037
Oh, my God.
I was just checking an ingrown hair.

15:55.037 --> 15:57.373
- No need to explain.
One second.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.668
Fumi. Hi.

16:01.752 --> 16:05.005
- I didn't know you were coming by.
I had the Uber drop me off.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.466
- Did you forget?
Lunch.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.303
Oh, my God. You know, Fumi,
it's been so hectic lately. Um...

16:12.262 --> 16:14.723
- Can we reschedule?
That's okay.

16:14.723 --> 16:18.310
- I could only do a quick bite, anyway.
Okay, great. Um--

16:18.310 --> 16:22.523
I'll make sure to book enough time
so we can order the whole menu.

16:24.483 --> 16:28.070
- May I?
- Yeah, of course.

16:32.992 --> 16:36.036
But, Joji, why wouldn't you just
leave that to the professionals?

16:36.036 --> 16:40.249
<i>These plumbers did stop by
the house, but I fixed it all by myself,</i>

16:40.249 --> 16:42.292
<i>you know, with my own two hands.</i>

16:42.292 --> 16:44.503
You sculpt with your hands.

16:44.503 --> 16:48.340
<i>I know, Mom,
but it's nice to feel useful for once.</i>

16:48.340 --> 16:50.592
<i>Oh, I'm pulling into Ojai now.</i>

16:50.592 --> 16:53.637
<i>I'll call you later, all right?
Miss you, love you.</i>

17:07.359 --> 17:08.861
<i>Hello, Joyce. It's Fumi.</i>

17:09.403 --> 17:11.864
Just calling to chat.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.615
Call me. Bye-bye.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.330
<i>You've reached Renee.
Leave me a message. Thanks.</i>

17:20.330 --> 17:23.584
Hello, Renee. It's Fumi.
Just calling to chat.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.877
<i>Call me. Bye-bye.</i>

17:28.130 --> 17:29.089
Um...

17:40.350 --> 17:41.602
- Hello, Tom.
<i>Mrs. Nakai.</i>

17:41.602 --> 17:43.896
Sorry I didn't get back to you earlier.
Busy day.

17:43.896 --> 17:45.731
<i>That's okay. I'm just following up.</i>

17:45.731 --> 17:48.400
<i>Were you able to get that loan
from your daughter-in-law?</i>

17:48.400 --> 17:52.029
We were supposed to speak earlier today.
I had to reschedule.

17:52.029 --> 17:53.739
<i>Listen, as your accountant,</i>

17:53.739 --> 17:56.325
<i>I have to say,
things are not looking good.</i>

17:56.325 --> 18:00.621
<i>Haru's estate isn't solvent,
and I just got your credit card statement.</i>

18:00.621 --> 18:01.955
<i>We've spoken about this.</i>

18:01.955 --> 18:05.209
<i>You need to create a new budget
or find new streams of revenue.</i>

18:05.209 --> 18:06.835
I know, I know.

18:06.835 --> 18:11.131
<i>You just got the Tamago chair back
from the gallery. Maybe finally sell?</i>

18:11.131 --> 18:13.467
I can't sell, you know that.

18:13.467 --> 18:16.011
And even if I wanted to,
George would never let me.

18:16.011 --> 18:17.721
<i>You want me to talk to him?</i>

18:17.721 --> 18:19.014
No, please don't.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.267
He's still not over Haru
leaving him so little.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.228
You know, he's out of town,

18:24.728 --> 18:27.481
but I can go to his place
and pick some other pieces to sell.

18:27.481 --> 18:28.398
Okay, Tom?

18:35.823 --> 18:38.450
Yo, last round.
I gotta pack up some clothes.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.952
My brother's coming home soon.

18:40.994 --> 18:44.248
Bro, can't keep avoiding him, man.
You live here.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.335
Whatever.
I'll just keep crashing with you guys.

18:48.335 --> 18:51.421
I don't know, man.
Gonna have to start charging you.

18:52.131 --> 18:53.132
All right.

18:53.132 --> 18:54.800
No, for real.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.219
I mean, our place isn't cheap.

18:57.761 --> 18:58.971
Market's been shit.

19:01.682 --> 19:03.016
Yeah. No, that's cool.

19:04.226 --> 19:07.604
Can't you just get
your sugar mama to help you out?

19:08.438 --> 19:10.190
She's not my sugar mama.

19:10.774 --> 19:14.111
I mean, she gave you cash,
and she's a mom.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.112
Mm-hm.

19:15.112 --> 19:18.031
No, we're just two humans
connecting, all right?

19:18.532 --> 19:21.368
- We care about each other.
- Care about that dick.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.081
Paul, I killed you.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.293
Dude, he's so sensitive, man.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.518
Shit.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.783
Hi.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.576
Hi.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.787
Look, I know I said this before,

20:46.787 --> 20:50.666
but if we're gonna hang out,
we can't do anything physical. Okay?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.334
Okay.

21:11.937 --> 21:15.565
<i>♪ I'm the one natural one
Make it easy... ♪</i>

21:15.565 --> 21:17.025
That feels so good.

21:17.025 --> 21:18.944
I want you to spit on it.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.574
<i>♪ Where I can love how I like
If I want it ♪</i>

21:24.574 --> 21:27.035
<i>♪ Whatever keeps me high... ♪</i>

21:31.748 --> 21:32.958
Oh, shit.

21:37.963 --> 21:38.797
Fuck.

21:40.882 --> 21:41.967
You feel so good.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.686
- Do you like my pussy?
- Yeah.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.938
You like how it squeezes your cock?

21:55.939 --> 21:58.817
Fuck, I'm gonna come so hard.

21:58.817 --> 22:01.862
I'm gonna come so hard.
I'm coming! I'm coming!

22:01.862 --> 22:03.989
I'm coming! I'm coming!

22:12.497 --> 22:15.167
So you got me thinking a lot
about my own future lately.

22:15.709 --> 22:17.419
Oh, yeah? How so?

22:18.462 --> 22:23.300
Just like getting my shit together,
starting to plan, you know.

22:23.842 --> 22:24.676
Yeah.

22:24.676 --> 22:25.761
That's good.

22:29.097 --> 22:32.350
I've been crashing at my boy's place
ever since the fight with Danny.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.561
Did he say anything about the arrest?

22:34.561 --> 22:37.564
No, he texted me some shit
about how I owe my cousin an apology,

22:37.564 --> 22:41.151
- but fuck that.
- Fuck that and fuck him.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.780
You know, I can't crash
at my boy's place forever.

22:45.864 --> 22:49.743
Like if I had my own place,
I could make some moves, you know.

22:50.952 --> 22:54.956
Even my brother is getting
his own spot, you know.

22:55.665 --> 22:57.375
Mm-hm. Yeah.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.420
I don't know, just...

23:02.214 --> 23:04.007
You think you could lend me some money?

23:06.134 --> 23:08.095
I'll pay it back, ASAP.

23:08.095 --> 23:11.765
I just-- I need a jumpstart, and then...

23:12.265 --> 23:15.602
I know I have it in me
to be a millionaire like you in no time.

23:16.812 --> 23:20.398
Well, you make it sound like
what I achieved was easy.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.276
No, I'm just saying, like--

23:24.736 --> 23:26.446
I'm saying I could do it too.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.699
Okay.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.871
What, like, now you don't think so?

23:34.871 --> 23:38.834
Well, Paul, it just takes a lot more
than good intentions.

23:39.543 --> 23:42.129
I have busted my ass for years.

23:42.129 --> 23:47.259
I've sacrificed my well-being,
the well-being of my family. It--

23:48.343 --> 23:50.595
It's not millionaire in no time.

23:50.595 --> 23:53.014
If you don't want to give me
the money, just say so.

23:53.014 --> 23:57.227
You don't have to be a bitch about it.
Jesus Christ.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.319
You should leave.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.157
I'm dead serious. Get the fuck out.

24:10.699 --> 24:11.533
Word.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.995
Nobody calls me a bitch
in my home. Get out.

24:14.995 --> 24:18.832
You know, work's not the reason
your life's a fucking mess.

24:53.950 --> 24:54.910
Hey, Naomi.

24:54.910 --> 24:58.663
I saw George's post. So cute.

24:58.663 --> 25:02.125
- What are you guys doing in Ojai?
<i>- I'm about to drive there now.</i>

25:02.125 --> 25:06.213
<i>We're having some work done on the house,
so he surprised me with the staycation.</i>

25:06.213 --> 25:08.173
He's so thoughtful.

25:08.840 --> 25:11.092
My husband never does stuff like that.

25:11.092 --> 25:13.428
<i>Yeah, George is-- He's pretty special.</i>

25:14.429 --> 25:17.390
<i>- Sorry, there's a tickle in my throat.</i>
- No worries.

25:17.390 --> 25:19.100
Hey, so small favor,

25:19.100 --> 25:23.396
I just got nominated for next year's
People to Watch in <i>Calabasas Style,</i>

25:23.396 --> 25:26.358
and I was hoping that
you could write a recommendation letter--

25:26.358 --> 25:29.569
<i>I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
Can you say that again?</i>

25:29.569 --> 25:33.365
Oh, no worries. I was saying that I'm up
for next year's People to Watch, and--

25:33.365 --> 25:36.201
<i>You know what, Naomi?
I have some work to do.</i>

25:36.201 --> 25:38.036
<i>Can l call you back later?</i>

25:38.036 --> 25:41.122
Sure. Sure, yeah. Call me back whenever.

26:12.487 --> 26:13.530
Hi.

26:35.093 --> 26:39.264
<i>I want you to know that,
despite what everybody tells you,</i>

26:39.264 --> 26:42.267
<i>- you can have it all. You can.</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

26:50.400 --> 26:52.610
Stuck-up bitch.

26:53.653 --> 26:56.281
<i>I was sitting in my car,
and all of a sudden,</i>

26:56.281 --> 27:01.411
<i>this woman just starts honking at me
from her fucking perfect white SUV.</i>

27:01.411 --> 27:04.164
<i>And then she fucking tags my truck
with "I'm a bitch."</i>

27:04.164 --> 27:05.874
<i>Is that normal behavior?</i>

27:05.874 --> 27:10.712
<i>Hey, security? Security, I think
some drunk tourists have wandered in.</i>

27:17.177 --> 27:19.596
You're sure all these came from the SUV?

27:19.596 --> 27:23.308
Neighbor said they saw the driver
throw trash out the window.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.019
I gathered everything I could find.

27:26.019 --> 27:28.355
Maybe from the truck, I don't know.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.734
You wouldn't happen to have seen
if the truck was tagged

27:32.734 --> 27:34.986
with "I'm a bitch"?

27:35.612 --> 27:36.738
Excuse me?

27:37.489 --> 27:40.158
I know a neighbor who drives a white SUV.

27:40.950 --> 27:42.285
It could be her.

27:42.285 --> 27:44.621
But do you have proof?

27:45.246 --> 27:49.084
No, but... I have a hunch.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.086
She doesn't have much regard for others.

27:51.086 --> 27:56.007
Well, I received 12 other tips
about white SUVs in the area.

27:56.007 --> 27:57.926
They're all convincing.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.011
But the cops are no help.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.097
Oh, I'll help you, Firouz.

28:02.097 --> 28:05.225
I'm a very busy woman,
but this is important to me.

28:05.225 --> 28:08.061
- And I will not--
- I never got the new <i>Calabasas Style.</i>

28:08.645 --> 28:11.564
You know,
I think someone is stealing my mail.

28:11.564 --> 28:12.857
Please take it.

28:15.151 --> 28:18.029
I'm actually up
for next year's People to Watch.

28:18.571 --> 28:21.324
Oh, impressive.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.368
That is no easy feat.

28:24.202 --> 28:25.537
Thank you.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.331
Well, I know lists are silly.

28:28.331 --> 28:31.209
Had I known I was visiting a celebrity,

28:31.209 --> 28:34.003
I would have brought
something to autograph.

28:34.003 --> 28:35.755
Oh, my God, stop.

28:39.843 --> 28:41.761
Do you want anything to drink?

28:51.813 --> 28:54.482
<i>Arming in 30 seconds.</i>

29:14.043 --> 29:16.629
<i>Four, three, two--</i>

29:17.756 --> 29:19.215
<i>- Disarmed.</i>

29:31.561 --> 29:33.855
<i>You've reached the offices
of Tom Jones, CPA.</i>

29:33.855 --> 29:36.775
<i>- Leave a message and I'll get back to you.</i>

29:36.775 --> 29:40.528
Hey, Tom. How much do you think
the Tamago will sell for?

29:40.528 --> 29:42.447
I think I'm going to sell it.

29:42.447 --> 29:46.201
There are some disruptive events
happening between my son and his wife.

29:46.201 --> 29:49.078
It may affect my finances. Call me ba--

29:52.373 --> 29:54.793
These rich people
get these fancy systems

29:54.793 --> 29:56.169
and don't even set them.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.671
- Look at all this money.
- My plan would've worked.

29:58.671 --> 30:02.217
Yeah, smashing and grabbing everything
in under two minutes isn't a plan, dude.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.385
'Cause you freeze under pressure.

30:04.385 --> 30:07.180
That's 'cause in fight or flight,
I'm fight. You understand?

30:07.180 --> 30:10.600
I'm trying to stay put,
activate my core, keep my trunk solid.

30:10.600 --> 30:13.728
You don't know if someone will pop out
and you gotta knock them out.

30:13.728 --> 30:16.940
Yo, if I sense
even a little bit of danger, pew!

30:17.315 --> 30:19.484
I'm flight, baby. Korean Air.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.195
Yeah, you're a bitch.

30:25.323 --> 30:29.744
Holy shit. Look at this thing, dude.
Look at this fancy thing.

30:29.744 --> 30:31.704
It's like on some <i>Beetlejuice</i> shit, huh?

30:31.704 --> 30:34.123
All those lumps and bumps.
I bet it's worth so much.

30:34.123 --> 30:36.167
Looks like herpes poo-pooed.

30:38.044 --> 30:39.712
I'm saying, you're obsessed.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.965
For someone
who supposedly doesn't have it,

30:41.965 --> 30:43.925
you talk about it all the time.

30:43.925 --> 30:49.222
No, I'm talking about the family.
I'm talking HSV-1, HSV-2.

30:49.222 --> 30:52.100
I'm talking zoster, Epstein-Barr.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.687
Ugh, what an unfortunate name
for a virus, you know.

30:56.437 --> 30:59.190
You motherfuckers!
- Oh, fuck.

31:07.615 --> 31:09.701
Shit!
