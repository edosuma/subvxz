on tape?

01:22.051 --> 01:24.654
What the hell is going on?!

01:25.254 --> 01:26.856
Police had an informant.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.459

They were investigating.
I told you.

01:56.052 --> 01:57.420

He won't believe me.

02:01.190 --> 02:02.792
Then what am I supposed to do?

02:03.493 --> 02:05.294
Sabrina...

02:05.294 --> 02:06.996
It is going to be okay.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.065
-[Sabrina] How do you know that?
-I know.

02:09.065 --> 02:11.667
I know, because Maurice is
going to tell the truth.

09:47.949 --> 09:49.217
Come on, let's make a stop.

09:49.217 --> 09:51.453
Okay, yeah.
Where do you wanna go?

09:51.453 --> 09:54.389
We're goin' to the weed man.
We both need that right now.

09:54.389 --> 09:57.826
Danni, I am not going to
a weed facility or...

09:57.826 --> 10:00.095
Wherever, whatever.
What are they called?

10:00.095 --> 10:02.097
Bitch, did you just say facility
just 'cause you're drivin'

10:02.097 --> 10:04.899
a damn Rolls Royce,
like you ain't smoke no weed?

10:04.899 --> 10:06.968
I, I...
I don't buy it.

10:06.968 --> 10:09.871
I just get it from you
sometimes, periodically.

10:09.871 --> 10:11.706
-They said...
-No, it's empty.

10:11.706 --> 10:13.274
I guess...

10:13.274 --> 10:15.577
I guess I'll just have to pull
off these damn gummies.

10:15.577 --> 10:17.011
Danni!

10:17.011 --> 10:18.680
-Drive, --.
-Okay.

10:18.680 --> 10:20.982
-Eyes on the road.
-Yes, 10 and 2.

10:22.117 --> 10:24.652
And nothin' to do with this.
You need one.

10:24.652 --> 10:25.854
I will not.

10:26.121 --> 10:28.323
[wrappers rustling]

10:28.323 --> 10:31.092
-I'll do one for you.
-No, thank you.

10:31.092 --> 10:33.862
-I said I'mma do it for you.
-Okay, yeah, do one.

10:33.862 --> 10:36.865
[music]

10:36.865 --> 10:38.466
Yeah.

10:38.466 --> 10:39.326
[music]

10:39.659 --> 10:48.501
[music]

10:43.296 --> 10:48.501
[music]

10:48.501 --> 10:50.136
-Hey.
-What's up?

10:50.136 --> 10:51.538
[Fatima] I called you.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.240
I text you.

10:54.441 --> 10:56.009
[music]

10:56.009 --> 10:58.244
Oh, you did.
I didn't even...

10:58.678 --> 10:59.813
[keys clattering]

10:59.813 --> 11:01.715
-Where you been?
-Where my kiss?

11:01.715 --> 11:03.416
I was out with Bryce.

11:03.416 --> 11:04.851
Oh, okay.

11:04.851 --> 11:06.486
Yeah, we went to look at
a house, so...

11:06.486 --> 11:07.721
I think we gonna buy it.

11:07.721 --> 11:09.055
Well, good.

11:10.223 --> 11:11.324
You good?

11:13.860 --> 11:15.528
Whoa, what was that?

11:15.528 --> 11:17.664
-That little hesitation.
-[Fatima] You know what, babe?

11:17.664 --> 11:18.898
How was your day?

11:18.898 --> 11:20.366
No, no.
What was that?

11:20.366 --> 11:22.902
[music]

11:22.902 --> 11:24.270
I need to talk to you.

11:24.270 --> 11:26.005
[music]

11:26.005 --> 11:27.373
Fatima, I...

11:27.373 --> 11:29.342
I really do not wanna
talk about Karen.

11:30.176 --> 11:31.711
It's not about Karen.

11:31.711 --> 11:33.146
Thank gosh.

11:33.913 --> 11:36.015
-[Fatima] It's about Heather.
-Ugh...

11:36.216 --> 11:37.684
Your other baby mama.

11:38.084 --> 11:40.386
Is that why you sittin' here
in your work suit?

11:40.386 --> 11:42.322
Mm-hm.
Yes.

11:42.322 --> 11:43.623
What's...?

11:43.623 --> 11:45.625
The DNA results already prove
that they baby is yours.

11:45.625 --> 11:46.693
I know, I know.

11:46.693 --> 11:48.194
-Yes.
-I know.

11:48.194 --> 11:51.197
There's a probability
that Karen's is yours, too.

11:52.098 --> 11:54.534
I, I know.
Fatima...

11:55.769 --> 11:57.003
You know...

11:57.570 --> 11:58.605
What?

11:58.605 --> 12:00.406
[music]

12:00.406 --> 12:01.474
I just...

12:02.075 --> 12:03.576
I don't want to be this...

12:04.043 --> 12:06.546
This broke joker,
with all these kids,

12:06.946 --> 12:09.182
and all these baby mothers,
I, I just don't.

12:09.983 --> 12:12.752
Zac, you're not a broke joke.
All right?

12:12.752 --> 12:15.121
Look, you had sex.
It happens.

12:17.690 --> 12:21.427
How are you so understanding?
Like, you just are.

12:22.462 --> 12:24.964
I, I'm not really cool
with all this.

12:24.964 --> 12:26.232
I'm not.

12:26.633 --> 12:28.001
But if I was one of them,

12:28.001 --> 12:30.436
I would want you
in the child's life.

12:30.436 --> 12:32.372
[music]

12:32.372 --> 12:34.574
Fatima, man, you have no idea.

12:35.408 --> 12:37.177
And with that being said...

12:38.444 --> 12:41.414
You, my dear, are about to
have some legal troubles.

12:41.648 --> 12:44.517
[music]

12:44.517 --> 12:45.852
What?

12:45.852 --> 12:47.687
Yeah.
I...

12:48.054 --> 12:49.823
I talked to
a girlfriend of mine,

12:49.823 --> 12:51.925
and with this house...

12:51.925 --> 12:53.293
And all the money you have...

12:53.593 --> 12:55.562
You're gonna get hit
really hard.

12:57.163 --> 12:58.631
I thought about that.

12:59.799 --> 13:01.067
Yeah.

13:01.734 --> 13:03.136
This could be bad.

13:03.469 --> 13:04.804
[Zac] I know.

13:04.804 --> 13:05.905
I know.

13:06.139 --> 13:08.074
[music]

13:08.074 --> 13:09.509
So, I...

13:10.743 --> 13:12.245
I know we're engaged.

13:13.379 --> 13:14.247
Yes?

13:14.848 --> 13:17.150
[Fatima] And I think we need to
talk about that.

13:18.051 --> 13:19.586
What you mean, talk about it?
Like...

13:19.586 --> 13:21.387
Like...
What's there to talk about?

13:21.387 --> 13:23.723
Look, Zac, in the state
of Georgia,

13:23.723 --> 13:25.091
your debt becomes mine

13:25.091 --> 13:26.526
and mine becomes yours
when we get married.

13:26.526 --> 13:28.728
You're the one with
the student loan debt, though.

13:28.728 --> 13:30.463
That's almost paid off.

13:30.763 --> 13:32.465
[Zac] Okay, so?
Like...

13:33.600 --> 13:34.868
I just...

13:34.868 --> 13:36.536
I don't think we need to rush
this wedding thing.

13:37.737 --> 13:40.273
We haven't even been talking
about the wedding, though.

13:41.341 --> 13:42.742
[Fatima] I know that.

13:43.276 --> 13:45.011
So what's up?
Like...

13:45.011 --> 13:49.015
[music]

13:49.015 --> 13:50.717
Heather...

13:51.651 --> 13:53.019
Went to see Hayden today.

13:53.019 --> 13:55.121
Oh my gosh!

13:55.722 --> 13:57.323
[Fatima] Yeah.

13:57.323 --> 14:01.127
And I know this -- gonna
come after you for everything.

14:01.427 --> 14:02.762
For that son of yours.

14:04.697 --> 14:07.767
Yo, this dude just won't quit.
Like, he just won't quit.

14:08.401 --> 14:09.769
I'm trying to spare his ass.

14:10.336 --> 14:12.038
Why are you keep trying to
spare him?!

14:12.038 --> 14:13.339
Like, why?!

14:13.339 --> 14:14.908
How, by not tellin' your cousin?

14:14.908 --> 14:16.509
Exactly.

14:18.077 --> 14:19.212
I was jokin'.

14:19.212 --> 14:21.514
Who, who is this girl?
Like...

14:22.348 --> 14:24.417
Zac, don't worry about that.

14:24.884 --> 14:26.185
You just need to
worry about him,

14:26.185 --> 14:27.687
and make sure you got
your shit together.

14:28.288 --> 14:30.456
-I got you.
-[Fatima] Yeah.

14:30.456 --> 14:33.126
And I'm sure she gon'
try to sue you, so...

14:33.126 --> 14:35.261
Make sure all your ducks
are in a row.

14:38.564 --> 14:39.632
Thank you.

14:40.700 --> 14:41.935
[Fatima] Sure.

14:42.368 --> 14:44.137
I'm not just talkin' about this.

14:44.604 --> 14:47.807
I'm...
I'm talkin' about everything.

14:48.341 --> 14:50.009
I know I'm an ex-con,

14:50.009 --> 14:51.344
I can't take you out
the country.

14:51.344 --> 14:55.248
I got all this baby mama drama
stuff, like...

14:55.248 --> 14:57.684
Zac, you got me.
All right?

14:58.117 --> 14:59.652
I'm ridin' with you.

14:59.652 --> 15:02.055
[music]

15:02.055 --> 15:03.623
You have no idea.

15:03.623 --> 15:06.592
Like, it's just amazing.
I wish you had some drama.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.962
-You know, I do.
-No...

15:08.962 --> 15:10.563
Nah.
You don't want that.

15:10.563 --> 15:13.499
-Nah.
-It'd be fair, though.

15:13.900 --> 15:16.035
Yeah, it probably would be fair,

15:16.035 --> 15:17.971
but baby, you don't want
Fatima drama.

15:17.971 --> 15:19.639
That is not what you want.

15:19.639 --> 15:23.443
You know me, I just try to stay
at peace and...

15:23.443 --> 15:24.911
-[Zac] Meditate.
-Centered, yeah.

15:24.911 --> 15:27.080
-I got it.
-Full of zen.

15:27.080 --> 15:28.348
I got you.

15:30.750 --> 15:31.985
You smell that?

15:32.852 --> 15:35.188
-Mm-mm, no.
-[Zac] You don't smell that?

15:35.521 --> 15:36.656
Mm-mm.

15:36.656 --> 15:38.591
Yeah, me neither,
where's the food at?

15:41.094 --> 15:43.529
Oh, you forgot you're supposed
to be takin' me out tonight?

15:43.529 --> 15:45.865
That's right.
My bad, you threw me off.

15:45.865 --> 15:47.900
I come in here, you talk about
my baby mothers, threw me off...

15:47.900 --> 15:49.268
All right, so...

15:49.268 --> 15:50.770
I get it, we can, we can figure
something out

15:50.770 --> 15:52.338
now that I know
you don't want to get married

15:52.338 --> 15:53.806
and you don't wanna cook,
it's cool.

15:53.806 --> 15:55.241
You know what I'm sayin'?
We'll figure somethin' out.

15:55.241 --> 15:56.809
All right?
[keys clattering]

15:56.809 --> 15:58.144
I'll cook.
Chill out.

15:58.144 --> 16:00.079
-Oh, you will?
-Yes.

16:00.079 --> 16:02.715
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

16:03.416 --> 16:05.018
All right, get in
that kitchen, baby.

16:05.018 --> 16:07.353
[music]

16:07.353 --> 16:08.621
-I'll take my shoes off.
-Yeah.

16:08.621 --> 16:10.356
-My bad.
-That we're not doing.

16:10.356 --> 16:12.425
Take my shoes off.

16:12.425 --> 16:15.928
All right, now you just
finally walk by.

16:16.162 --> 16:17.296
I hate to see you leave,

16:17.296 --> 16:19.132
but I love to watch you
walk away!

16:19.132 --> 16:21.300
-[Fatima] I bet you do.
-Uh-huh!

16:21.634 --> 16:24.904
[music]
[crickets chirping]

16:24.904 --> 16:26.572

16:26.572 --> 16:29.208
-Is that them?
-Yeah.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.643
Probably.

16:31.277 --> 16:33.613
-Wanna grab that?
-Yeah.

16:35.882 --> 16:37.383
Yeah.
Hi.

16:37.383 --> 16:38.718
You weren't fast enough.

16:39.786 --> 16:41.754
Okay.
Hi.

16:41.754 --> 16:43.089
You're here.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.390
[Aaron] I was just leaving.

16:44.390 --> 16:45.858
-Oh, good.
-Yeah, that's great.

16:45.858 --> 16:48.961
'Cause I definitely wanna
smoke, and drink, and get high,

16:48.961 --> 16:50.196
and cuss, and fuss.

16:50.196 --> 16:51.998
And not be judged for it.

16:51.998 --> 16:54.801
Well, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't do that anyway.

16:54.801 --> 16:56.369
My kind of preacher.

16:56.369 --> 16:59.138
[Aaron] Yeah, except...
You can't smoke in here.

16:59.138 --> 17:01.574
Spoke too soon.
Spoke too soon.

17:01.574 --> 17:04.310
It's not good for the baby.
Right?

17:04.310 --> 17:05.978
That's true, right.
Okay, okay.

17:05.978 --> 17:07.413
I'll just...

17:08.481 --> 17:10.516
Well, I'll leave you to it,
then.

17:10.516 --> 17:12.218
[Karen] Thanks for stoppin' by.

17:12.218 --> 17:13.853
I'll see you later.

17:13.853 --> 17:15.088
-Okay.
-[Aaron] Okay.

17:15.088 --> 17:17.056
-Bye, ladies.
-Bye!

17:17.056 --> 17:18.558
Have a good night.

17:18.791 --> 17:20.193

17:20.193 --> 17:21.761
Thumbs up.

[music]

17:24.831 --> 17:25.998
[Karen] Hey, y'all.

17:25.998 --> 17:27.567
-[Andi] Hi.
-Where's 'Brina?

17:27.567 --> 17:29.435
I wanted all y'all here.
Let me call her.

17:29.435 --> 17:31.704
No...
She couldn't make it.

17:32.205 --> 17:34.841
-Why?
-Andi...

17:34.841 --> 17:36.209
No.

17:36.209 --> 17:37.877
What is goin' on?

17:38.277 --> 17:39.679
How are you feeling?

17:40.847 --> 17:44.217
-I feel good, Andi.
-[Andi] That's good.

17:44.217 --> 17:45.418
[Danni] Like, really good?

17:45.852 --> 17:48.287
Yeah, I mean, I feel like
my old self.

17:48.287 --> 17:50.456
Oh great, okay, well then,
in that case...

17:50.456 --> 17:52.425
-We got a situation.
-Danni...

17:52.425 --> 17:54.627
Hush.
Sabrina is in jail.

17:55.661 --> 17:56.829
What?!

17:58.598 --> 17:59.765
What?!

18:01.184 --> 18:05.288
[music]

18:05.288 --> 18:06.690
What?!

18:06.690 --> 18:07.857
Danni!

18:08.758 --> 18:10.060
Tell her.

18:10.060 --> 18:11.828
Somebody tell me somethin'!
Tell me somethin' now!

18:12.162 --> 18:15.599
Okay, Sabrina got arrested
for the bank robbery.

18:16.066 --> 18:17.834
What?!

18:18.268 --> 18:19.469
Yes.

18:20.470 --> 18:22.405
The guy Maurice was dating...

18:22.405 --> 18:23.907
Apparently...

18:25.642 --> 18:28.812
Said that Maurice and Sabrina
were involved in the robbery,

18:28.812 --> 18:30.247
and both of them got arrested.

18:30.247 --> 18:31.548
There ain't no way.

18:31.548 --> 18:33.216
There ain't no way,
we gotta get her out.

18:33.216 --> 18:34.484
-Andi!
-I know!

18:34.484 --> 18:35.719
We are doing everything we can.

18:35.719 --> 18:37.687
Okay, well do somethin'!
Call somebody!

18:37.687 --> 18:39.055
Call your boss!
Can you call your boss?

18:39.055 --> 18:41.157
-That's what I said.
-Well, what'd he say?

18:41.157 --> 18:43.426
-They're not talkin'.
-Danni!

18:44.761 --> 18:47.063
Then just...
Just tell her.

18:47.063 --> 18:48.531
Just tell her.

18:48.732 --> 18:53.303
I asked my boss,
and he said no.

18:54.037 --> 18:57.507
But I am working on
other resources

18:57.507 --> 19:00.143
and different avenues
as we speak.

19:00.143 --> 19:01.911
'Brina ain't built for jail.

19:01.911 --> 19:04.814
-That's what I said, too.
-Yeah, she can't handle it.

19:04.814 --> 19:07.417
-I know.
-We have to get her out.

19:07.417 --> 19:08.852
I know.
I am doing everything I can.

19:08.852 --> 19:11.488
-Okay, but...
-Don't call the mama.

19:11.955 --> 19:13.223
We know that.

19:13.223 --> 19:14.691
-Can't do that.
-Listen.

19:14.691 --> 19:16.660
You just don't
worry about this, okay?

19:16.660 --> 19:18.295
We don't need you getting upset.

19:18.295 --> 19:19.829
Okay?
I'm doing everything.

19:19.829 --> 19:20.897
I got this.

19:20.897 --> 19:22.632
Okay, but what exactly
is that, Andi?

19:22.632 --> 19:24.200
Because she's still in jail,
apparently.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.504
Well, I have other contacts
that I'm currently working on.

19:28.371 --> 19:29.706
Damn, 'Brina!

19:31.608 --> 19:35.011
It's fine, it's okay.
Everything is going to be okay.

19:35.011 --> 19:36.713
-Okay?
-No, it ain't.

19:36.713 --> 19:38.682
Not as long as she inside.

19:38.682 --> 19:42.185
I've been smokin' and drinkin'
since I found out.

19:42.185 --> 19:43.720
[music]

19:43.720 --> 19:45.522
Don't you do that anyway?

19:45.522 --> 19:46.956
Extra heavy.

19:47.757 --> 19:49.793
I don't know how I'm sittin' up
right now.

19:49.793 --> 19:53.730
Look, this is my top priority,
I'm gonna take care of it.

19:53.730 --> 19:55.565
But we can't do
anything right now.

19:55.565 --> 19:57.067
-I know.
-[Andi] Okay?

19:57.067 --> 19:58.635
-I know.
-[Andi] Okay.

19:58.635 --> 20:00.337
That's it, you got this.
Right?

20:00.337 --> 20:02.072
-[Andi] Yes.
-[Karen] Okay, okay, okay.

20:02.072 --> 20:03.540
-You wanted to talk to us.
-[Karen] Mm-hm!

20:03.540 --> 20:05.141
We're here.

20:05.141 --> 20:06.710
Oh...

20:08.445 --> 20:09.913
The circle ain't complete.

20:10.780 --> 20:13.316
But...
I mean, we're here.

20:13.950 --> 20:17.053
I know know, but I wanted
'Brina here, too.

20:17.053 --> 20:18.621
Well, you can't have her.

20:18.621 --> 20:20.290
Okay?
So your talk.

20:20.290 --> 20:21.658
[clapping]

20:22.492 --> 20:23.860
Fine.

20:25.762 --> 20:28.765
I made an appointment at
the hospital.

20:28.765 --> 20:31.000
To follow up on the ultrasound.

20:32.302 --> 20:35.939
They should be able to tell me
about the date of conception.

20:37.073 --> 20:38.274
Okay.

20:38.641 --> 20:40.176
So I'll know if it's...

20:40.610 --> 20:41.945
Zac's or the preacher's.

20:42.312 --> 20:43.480
Possible.

20:43.813 --> 20:45.882
I'll go in tomorrow to see.

20:46.516 --> 20:48.752
-Andi, I want you to come.
-I am there.

20:48.752 --> 20:50.387
[Karen] But you have to work...

20:50.387 --> 20:52.055
-[Karen] On Sabrina.
-I can do both.

20:52.055 --> 20:53.556
Okay?

20:54.891 --> 20:56.025
Danni?

20:57.327 --> 20:58.728
I want you to come, too.

21:00.530 --> 21:03.733
-What?
-[Karen] Yes, I do.

21:04.467 --> 21:05.902
No, you don't.

21:05.902 --> 21:06.936
Yes, I do!

21:06.936 --> 21:08.671
I wouldn't say it if
I didn't mean it.

21:09.339 --> 21:11.341
You don't worry about me saying
something crazy?

21:11.341 --> 21:12.976
I'm fine, okay?
I am.

21:15.412 --> 21:17.914
All right, so if
it's not Zac's baby.

21:17.914 --> 21:19.716
[Andi] Now, that's a good point.

21:21.951 --> 21:23.153
It's fine.

21:24.087 --> 21:26.256
-What?
-Yeah.

21:27.924 --> 21:29.592
Y'all remember that exercise

21:29.592 --> 21:31.594
my mama had me do
with the letters?

21:32.495 --> 21:34.197
Well, it worked.

21:35.064 --> 21:37.534
Just feelin' differently
these days.

21:38.868 --> 21:41.271
-Just like that?
-[Karen] Well, no, not...

21:41.571 --> 21:43.540
Just like that.
But...

21:44.441 --> 21:45.542
Yeah.

21:45.742 --> 21:47.610
I don't know how to describe it.

21:48.545 --> 21:51.181
I think I do.
I do.

21:51.181 --> 21:52.549
-[Karen] How?
-How?

21:52.549 --> 21:54.818
Psycho babble bullshit.

21:55.318 --> 21:58.288
No!
Seriously, okay?

21:58.721 --> 22:02.992
I mean, at first...
I was destroyed, but...

22:04.127 --> 22:05.428
I mean, just...

22:05.428 --> 22:07.964
You know, gettin' it all
out, and speakin' my truth...

22:09.265 --> 22:13.603
Now I kinda feel like
I can, I don't know...

22:13.903 --> 22:14.838
Move on?

22:14.838 --> 22:18.908
Yeah, but if it is Zac's baby...

22:20.176 --> 22:22.512
Okay, maybe she shouldn't come.
Actually.

22:22.712 --> 22:24.180
-She's coming.
-I mean...

22:24.180 --> 22:26.916
-I been sayin' that.
-She knows how to behave.

22:26.916 --> 22:28.785
-Does she?
-[Danni] I do?

22:28.785 --> 22:30.620
[Andi] Stop it.
She's coming.

22:30.620 --> 22:32.755
-Okay.
-That's a great question.

22:33.957 --> 22:36.092
This don't feel right
without 'Brina, though.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.495
I know.
I...

22:38.695 --> 22:41.364
Look.
You don't worry about it.

22:41.364 --> 22:43.099
[phone buzzing]

22:43.399 --> 22:45.101
Oh.
No.

22:45.101 --> 22:46.302
What?

22:46.302 --> 22:47.704
[Andi] It's Robin.

22:48.004 --> 22:49.305
Answer it!

22:49.305 --> 22:51.040
I don't want to.

22:51.341 --> 22:53.409
Hey, I wanted to remind you
about this thing...

22:53.409 --> 22:54.677
What?

22:54.677 --> 22:56.412
So our friend Sabrina's in jail?

22:56.613 --> 22:58.381
-Yeah, yup.
-Yeah, yeah.

22:58.381 --> 22:59.649
It's not about you right now.

22:59.649 --> 23:01.618
-[Andi] I got it.
-Answer that shit.

23:01.618 --> 23:03.786
[Andi] Okay!
Fine!

23:06.923 --> 23:08.057
Yes?

23:08.057 --> 23:10.760
Hi, I wanna talk about business.

23:10.760 --> 23:12.829
[Andi]<i> Okay.
What?</i>

23:13.630 --> 23:14.931
Okay, I lied.

23:14.931 --> 23:16.733
Why are you calling me?

23:17.433 --> 23:19.102
[Robin]<i> I can help your friend.</i>

23:20.436 --> 23:22.105
Sabrina?

23:22.105 --> 23:23.239
[Robin]<i> Yes.</i>

23:24.507 --> 23:26.342
Okay.
What can you do for her?

23:27.877 --> 23:29.245
I got some calls in.

23:29.245 --> 23:31.281
[scoffing]
[Andi]<i> I've already tried that.</i>

23:31.281 --> 23:33.550
<i>I told you,
the prosecutor isn't budging.</i>

23:33.550 --> 23:35.585
I beat him in
a divorce settlement,

23:35.585 --> 23:37.220
and now he's trying to
get back at me.

23:38.221 --> 23:40.490
Andi, you know I don't talk to
the staffers.

23:40.490 --> 23:41.824
I can talk to his boss.

23:41.824 --> 23:44.193
[Andi]<i> Oh.
Okay.</i>

23:45.528 --> 23:47.764
This is looking pretty damning.
Are you sure she's not involved?

23:47.764 --> 23:49.966
One hundred percent.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.403
[Robin]<i> All right, then I'm
going to do everything I can.</i>

23:55.071 --> 23:56.372
Okay.

23:56.372 --> 23:58.408
Hey, I'm sorry, again.

23:58.408 --> 23:59.475
[Andi]<i> Mm-hm.</i>

23:59.676 --> 24:01.377
[music]

24:01.377 --> 24:02.612
Andi, come on.

24:02.912 --> 24:04.013
[Andi]<i> What?</i>

24:04.614 --> 24:07.050
I just called you to say I was
gonna help your friend,

24:07.050 --> 24:08.318
and you're not budging.

24:08.318 --> 24:11.220
Because you were rude and
humiliating to me.

24:11.721 --> 24:13.289
I said I was sorry.

24:13.489 --> 24:14.757
[Andi]<i> That's not enough.</i>

24:14.757 --> 24:18.795
[music]

24:18.795 --> 24:20.630
All right.
How can I make it up to you?

24:20.830 --> 24:22.098
You can't.

24:22.799 --> 24:24.400
[Robin]<i> Well, I can
start trying.</i>

24:26.269 --> 24:27.804
Just help my friend.

24:27.804 --> 24:29.472
Is that a start?

24:29.472 --> 24:31.374
I said help my friend.

24:31.374 --> 24:33.676
All right, I'll call you as soon
as I hear something.

24:33.676 --> 24:35.078
I have to go.

24:35.712 --> 24:37.080
My other line is ringing.

24:37.614 --> 24:39.549
Okay, bye.

24:39.816 --> 24:44.187
[music]

24:44.187 --> 24:45.655
Hello?

24:45.655 --> 24:46.823
I can't take it.

24:46.823 --> 24:48.358
[Andi]<i> What?</i>

24:48.591 --> 24:50.159
I need to see you tonight.

24:52.328 --> 24:53.997
Gary...

24:53.997 --> 24:55.698
[Gary]<i> Come on, just let me
come over for a little bit.</i>

24:55.698 --> 24:58.468
You always say a little bit,
and then you stay all night.

24:58.668 --> 25:00.937
You love every minute of it.

25:02.739 --> 25:04.874
I'm at Karen's right now.

25:04.874 --> 25:07.143
But I'll be home in an hour.

25:07.343 --> 25:09.812
Yes.
Okay.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.781
[Andi]<i> When I get there,
be there naked,</i>

25:11.781 --> 25:13.216
<i>and I'll command you.</i>

25:13.216 --> 25:14.450
Yes, ma'am.

25:14.851 --> 25:16.853
I'll have the concierge
let you up.

25:16.853 --> 25:18.588
Now we're talking.

25:18.588 --> 25:19.756
[Andi]<i> Bye.</i>

25:19.756 --> 25:21.524
I'll see you in a bit.
Bye.

25:21.724 --> 25:22.725
[music]

25:27.839 --> 25:29.474
Hold on one sec.

25:29.474 --> 25:30.842
[Gary] Take care, y'all.

25:31.176 --> 25:33.244
Man, you always say that
when you're losing.

25:33.611 --> 25:35.914
I always say that when I got
a hot date tonight.

25:35.914 --> 25:38.416
Ah, okay.
Well, what's his name?

25:39.284 --> 25:40.618
You're funny.

25:40.618 --> 25:42.420
-Funny, I get it with you.
-Okay.

25:42.420 --> 25:44.689
[Gary] Be around here next week
or so, we'll get you the game.

25:44.689 --> 25:46.491
-Okay, see you next week.
-What up, Zac?

25:46.491 --> 25:48.193
[Zac] No, Gary.
No.

25:48.827 --> 25:50.395
I'll get another game
with y'all next time.

25:50.395 --> 25:52.597
-All right, man.
-[Gary] All right, Zac.

25:52.597 --> 25:55.533
I said no.
He keep talkin' to me.

25:55.533 --> 25:58.103
Yo, Zac.

25:58.103 --> 26:02.807
Before you get started,
I come here to relax.

26:02.807 --> 26:04.709
I don't want no stress.

26:04.709 --> 26:06.244
-[Aaron] I get that.
-Okay.

26:06.244 --> 26:07.846
I'm not tryin' to stress
you out, man.

26:07.846 --> 26:09.814
[Zac] I'm glad we're on
the same page.

26:09.814 --> 26:11.983
I just do not want you
on my team.

26:12.917 --> 26:14.319
Come on, man.

26:14.319 --> 26:17.222
Well, I certainly don't want
you on my team.

26:19.390 --> 26:22.761
You gotta be shittin' me.
What are you doin' here?!

26:22.761 --> 26:24.395
I heard this is the spot for
basketball.

26:26.931 --> 26:28.333
You know what?

26:28.333 --> 26:29.768
[bag rustling]

26:29.768 --> 26:31.236
Whoa, what's up, Zac?
Where you goin'?

26:31.236 --> 26:34.139
I'm goin' home,
so I don't go to jail.

26:34.773 --> 26:36.407
I just want to play, Zac.
That's all.

26:36.407 --> 26:38.109
That's your problem.
You play too much!

26:38.109 --> 26:40.745
You know, you might wanna look
into gettin' a real good lawyer.

26:40.745 --> 26:42.380
[scoffing]
[Zac] Man...

26:42.380 --> 26:43.982
I'm tellin' you
I'm tellin' you, bro.

26:43.982 --> 26:45.617
This...
This Heather girl?

26:46.451 --> 26:48.520
You messed with
the wrong one, huh?

26:48.520 --> 26:51.322
Bro, what is wrong with you?

26:51.322 --> 26:52.524
[Hayden] Nothin'.

26:52.524 --> 26:54.726
No, it's, it's somethin'.
It's, it's somethin'.

26:54.726 --> 26:55.860
-Oh, yeah?
-[Zac] Yes.

26:55.860 --> 26:57.162
And I see you finally
got a lineup.

26:57.162 --> 26:58.897
Someone introduce
you to a durag?

26:58.897 --> 27:01.065
Where'd you learn that, jail?

27:01.065 --> 27:02.400
Oh, you're funny now.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.135
-[Hayden] You like that?
-Ha, ha, ha.

27:04.135 --> 27:05.804
See...
I'mma keep it real with you.

27:05.804 --> 27:08.506
See...
I don't like a -- like you...

27:08.506 --> 27:10.308
Out here breakin' the law.

27:10.308 --> 27:12.410
So you a Karen.

27:12.410 --> 27:13.678
[Hayden] What?

27:13.678 --> 27:14.946
I said you're a Karen!

27:14.946 --> 27:17.549
-Come on, man.
-What you say about Karen?

27:18.750 --> 27:21.152
Not...

27:21.152 --> 27:23.488
Nobody was talkin' to you, bro!

27:23.488 --> 27:25.456
-No, I just heard you say...
-You know what?!

27:25.456 --> 27:26.825
I'm good, I'm good.

27:26.825 --> 27:28.426
Y'all just...
Y'all can have this.

27:28.426 --> 27:29.494
Hey, bro, hey.

27:29.494 --> 27:30.929
Enjoy that freedom while you
can, okay?

27:30.929 --> 27:31.996
I got you.

27:32.597 --> 27:35.266
'Cause I'mma lock that ass up.
You know that, right?

27:36.601 --> 27:39.137
Hatin'?
-- you, bro.

27:39.137 --> 27:41.072
Okay, it's...
It's Hayden.

27:41.072 --> 27:42.907
Hatin', -- you.

27:42.907 --> 27:44.475
I know what you're tryin'
to do, bro!

27:44.475 --> 27:45.610
What am I tryin' to do?

27:45.610 --> 27:47.312
You want me to beat your ass
again, right?

27:47.312 --> 27:48.613
Yeah, I would like that,
actually, yes.

27:48.613 --> 27:51.082
I know you would, 'cause
you want me to go to prison.

27:51.082 --> 27:52.417
But I'm not, dude!

27:52.417 --> 27:55.486
See, you goin' to prison
regardless.

27:55.486 --> 27:58.089
[music]

27:58.089 --> 28:02.093
Hatin', that may or may not
be true.

28:02.093 --> 28:03.928
-[Hayden] Mm-hm.
-But I can tell you one thing.

28:03.928 --> 28:06.030
If it is,
it will not be because of you.

28:06.531 --> 28:09.133
-Come on, Zac.
-[Zac] Come on, what?

28:09.133 --> 28:10.869
You know you're weak.

28:10.869 --> 28:12.070
-I'm weak?
-[Hayden] You're weak.

28:12.070 --> 28:13.638
I'm weak.
You've seen my weak.

28:13.638 --> 28:15.039
Remember in the office?

28:15.039 --> 28:17.208
"Somebody come get this --!"
You remember that?

28:17.208 --> 28:18.710
You was cryin' like
a little bitch?

28:18.710 --> 28:19.911
Remember that?

28:19.911 --> 28:21.446
Y'all chill out, man.

28:21.446 --> 28:23.047
-Don't touch me, touch him!
-I don't even know you, bro.

28:23.047 --> 28:24.282
Not me, him!

28:24.282 --> 28:25.750
I don't even know you
like that, bro.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.952
-I'm just tryin' to keep...
-I ain't got time for this shit.

28:27.952 --> 28:29.287
For real.

28:29.287 --> 28:32.223
See, can't nobody talk to
this asshole!

28:32.223 --> 28:33.157
I see.

28:33.157 --> 28:35.793
[basketball bouncing]

28:35.793 --> 28:38.763
I'm outta here, bro.

28:38.763 --> 28:41.466
Zac, hold up, man.

28:42.367 --> 28:43.635
What?!

28:44.769 --> 28:46.504
I'm not your enemy, brother.

28:47.672 --> 28:48.973
I don't care!

28:48.973 --> 28:51.175
[keys jingling]
[basketball bouncing]

28:51.175 --> 28:53.278
Zac, can't we just be cool?

28:53.278 --> 28:55.313
Why, I don't want to be
cool with you!

28:55.313 --> 28:58.283
I don't, and I don't want you to
be cool with me. Okay?

28:58.283 --> 28:59.751
All right, well, look.
If this baby is yours...

28:59.751 --> 29:01.252
[shouting]
Don't do that.

29:01.252 --> 29:03.454
Remember I said no stress at the
beginning when I first got here?

29:03.454 --> 29:05.623
That gives me stress.
I don't need that.

29:05.623 --> 29:06.958
I don't want that.

29:06.958 --> 29:08.426
No baby talk.
Can we, can we settle on that?

29:08.426 --> 29:10.895
I don't want us to be hostile
with each other, okay?

29:10.895 --> 29:12.397
We don't need
bad blood between us.

29:13.164 --> 29:16.567
Aaron, I like hostility.
Okay?

29:16.567 --> 29:17.468
'Cause I don't like you.

29:17.468 --> 29:18.803
A matter of fact,
I hate you.

29:18.803 --> 29:20.204
All right?

29:20.204 --> 29:21.973
And every time I meet you,
you're nice to me.

29:21.973 --> 29:23.374
And I like you
a little bit more.

29:23.374 --> 29:26.244
And I start to hate myself,
'cause I wanna hate you!

29:26.244 --> 29:29.314
So leave me alone!
Please!

29:29.314 --> 29:32.951
[music]

29:32.951 --> 29:35.053
One day you're gonna let
that love in, Zac!

29:35.053 --> 29:36.087
[screaming]

29:36.087 --> 29:37.655
[Zac] Stop!

29:37.989 --> 29:44.128
[music]

29:45.563 --> 29:48.900
[crickets chirping]

29:48.900 --> 29:52.870
[music]

29:52.870 --> 29:55.173
[door closing]
[sighing]

29:55.473 --> 30:05.116
[music]

29:59.777 --> 30:05.116
[music]

30:05.116 --> 30:08.753
So I'm guessing
she told you everything?

30:09.087 --> 30:11.022
-[Karen] Yeah.
-We talk about this.

30:11.022 --> 30:12.390
Why are you with Gary?

30:12.390 --> 30:14.258
It's 'cause she doesn't want him
to sue her.

30:14.258 --> 30:16.060
Now that's bullshit.

30:16.060 --> 30:17.729
Is it?

30:17.729 --> 30:19.097
[Karen] Yeah, it is.

30:20.098 --> 30:22.166
You know, it's getting late.

30:22.166 --> 30:25.470
I think we should go to
our respective homes and...

30:25.470 --> 30:26.504
I wanna know.

30:27.805 --> 30:29.474
Well, you know what?

30:29.941 --> 30:32.443
When I know, I'll let you know.

30:33.211 --> 30:34.846
I wanna know now, Andi.

30:35.079 --> 30:36.180
Mm-hm.

30:37.048 --> 30:42.253
Do you wanna know about the time
that Danni picked up a stray...

30:43.021 --> 30:44.589
And he spat on her?

30:44.822 --> 30:46.257
What?!

30:46.257 --> 30:48.159
And I'm not talking about
the kind when they say,

30:48.159 --> 30:49.660
"I want you to spit in my
mouth."

30:49.660 --> 30:50.728
We know that kind.

30:51.162 --> 30:54.132
No, not that kind.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.169
What the hell happened?

30:59.037 --> 31:00.538
This is -- low down.

31:00.538 --> 31:02.774
Yeah, but we're talkin' about
everything, right?

31:02.774 --> 31:03.841
We're discussing?

31:04.609 --> 31:08.479
My business is out here, so...
Yeah.

31:08.479 --> 31:09.814
Okay, bitch.

31:09.814 --> 31:11.115
Checkmate.

31:11.115 --> 31:12.817
Will somebody say somethin',
please?

31:12.817 --> 31:14.185
Please say somethin'.

31:14.185 --> 31:16.454
Okay, I'll start.

31:17.522 --> 31:21.225
While Danni was in the middle of
her hot girl summer...

31:22.060 --> 31:25.830
She picked up a stray
who spat on her.

31:27.832 --> 31:30.668
Little --, woman beater, also.

31:30.668 --> 31:32.370
Why don't we add that
to the list?

31:32.370 --> 31:33.971
Okay, yes, also those things.

31:33.971 --> 31:35.073
What?

31:35.073 --> 31:36.340
[Danni] Yes.

31:36.974 --> 31:38.609
He spat on you?

31:40.011 --> 31:41.546
I ran him over in my car.

31:42.080 --> 31:43.347
Checkmate.

31:43.948 --> 31:45.216
Touché.

31:46.050 --> 31:47.318
She thought she killed him.

31:47.552 --> 31:48.820
Oh my God!

31:50.021 --> 31:51.989
This is why I can't be away.

31:51.989 --> 31:53.124
You cannot be away.

31:53.357 --> 31:54.926
[Karen] Oh my God.

31:55.226 --> 31:57.361
Did you...
Hurt him?

31:57.562 --> 32:00.765
[music]

32:00.765 --> 32:02.533
I wanted to kill him.

32:04.102 --> 32:05.837
[Andi] Danni,
you would have gotten life.

32:06.137 --> 32:08.372
Nah, my girl Fatima said that...

32:08.372 --> 32:10.274
No, no, no, no.

32:10.908 --> 32:12.243
[Danni] Oh, shit.

32:13.878 --> 32:15.480
Your girl Fatima?

32:15.746 --> 32:17.548
Shit, Karen!
Damn!

32:17.548 --> 32:19.550
[Karen] So y'all friends now?

32:19.550 --> 32:20.718
No.

32:20.718 --> 32:22.386
You just said your girl.

32:22.386 --> 32:23.821
What time is it?
I think Preston's...

32:23.821 --> 32:25.323
-Waitin' for me.
-[Andi]Yeah, that's a good idea.

32:25.323 --> 32:26.858
-We should...
-[Karen] Nuh-uh, nuh-uh.

32:26.858 --> 32:28.159
You said your girl.

32:29.961 --> 32:33.097
She was there when I was
tryin' to talk to this one.

32:33.097 --> 32:35.299
and she told me
it was self defense.

32:35.299 --> 32:37.969
She held me down better than
this bitch, anyway, so...

32:38.636 --> 32:40.938
Oh, is, is Fatima a lawyer now?

32:40.938 --> 32:43.074
No, she is not an attorney.

32:43.074 --> 32:45.776
I passed the bar.
Thank you.

32:45.776 --> 32:47.945
She's not.
But y'all sister-sister, now.

32:47.945 --> 32:49.847
The chick is cool as ice water.

32:50.948 --> 32:52.250
If she wasn't with Zac,

32:52.250 --> 32:54.752
she'd probably be in
our sister circle by now.

32:54.752 --> 32:56.254
Sittin' right here.

32:56.254 --> 32:58.456
I don't disagree with that.

32:58.456 --> 32:59.824
[Karen] Okay, you know what--

32:59.824 --> 33:02.527
So, you know,
we don't want to upset you.

33:02.527 --> 33:04.328
-So we can go.
-I'm not upset.

33:05.196 --> 33:06.797
-You're not?
-You're not?

33:06.797 --> 33:07.865
Nope.

33:08.299 --> 33:10.868
So why you so damn stiff
and erect, huh?

33:11.669 --> 33:13.104
It's how I sit.

33:13.104 --> 33:16.207
Bitch, you ain't Michelle Obama
posin' for a damn portrait.

33:16.207 --> 33:17.942
You better help 'Brina.

33:19.944 --> 33:21.779
Robin's gonna help me with it.

33:21.779 --> 33:23.481
I hope he can help.

33:24.248 --> 33:25.883
Me, too.

33:28.219 --> 33:29.954
Okay.
We love you.

33:29.954 --> 33:31.622
Get some rest, okay?

33:37.128 --> 33:39.964
I didn't get no food.

33:39.964 --> 33:41.566
It's fine, okay?

33:42.266 --> 33:44.802
Love you!

33:44.802 --> 33:46.237
Bye.

33:46.237 --> 33:47.939
[door slamming]

33:47.939 --> 33:50.775
[music]

34:22.707 --> 34:23.875
[Danni] Hi.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.343
[Preston] Hey.

34:26.011 --> 34:27.379
Where's your car?

34:27.846 --> 34:29.347
I let her drive.

34:30.382 --> 34:31.917
You okay?

34:32.350 --> 34:33.919
[Danni] Good.

34:34.319 --> 34:35.654
You wanna go in?

34:36.988 --> 34:38.390
Mm-mm.

34:39.691 --> 34:41.626
-Let's just...
-You don't want me to go inside?

34:41.626 --> 34:43.662
Let's just stand here.
Let's talk.

34:44.129 --> 34:45.363
Okay.

34:46.998 --> 34:48.533
You got here fast.

34:50.135 --> 34:51.470
It's just a plane ride.

34:54.873 --> 34:55.941
Did you...

34:57.509 --> 34:59.411
Did you ask 'ole girl
to marry you?

35:02.714 --> 35:04.116
No.

35:04.116 --> 35:05.383
I didn't.

35:07.052 --> 35:08.353
But you saw her?

35:09.354 --> 35:10.889
[Preston] I have.

35:13.925 --> 35:15.494
What are you gonna do?

35:17.195 --> 35:18.630
Well, Danni...

35:19.197 --> 35:21.066
That all depends on what you do.

35:25.203 --> 35:27.305
Well, that's not fair.

35:27.305 --> 35:28.607
Is it?

35:28.907 --> 35:30.942
No, it's not.

35:31.176 --> 35:32.577
[sniffling]

35:33.712 --> 35:35.847
Why are you always putting
pressure on me?

35:35.847 --> 35:37.916
[Preston] Danni, I'm not trying
to pressure you.

35:37.916 --> 35:39.117
It feels that way.

35:40.452 --> 35:42.087
Well, I don't want you
to feel that way.

35:42.988 --> 35:46.224
Well, looks like we're...

35:46.224 --> 35:48.927
Where we always are.

35:49.294 --> 35:51.129
I'm just asking you to help me.

35:52.430 --> 35:54.833
-That's all.
-Help you do what, Preston?

35:55.133 --> 35:56.801
Help me know how to love you.

35:57.402 --> 35:59.704
And I don't mean how to
love a woman.

35:59.704 --> 36:01.306
I know how to do that.
I mean...

36:01.306 --> 36:03.708
How to love Danni,
the individual.

36:03.708 --> 36:05.977
How to say the right things
that Danni wants to hear.

36:09.281 --> 36:12.717
I don't think...
I...

36:17.389 --> 36:18.757
I don't know what I want.

36:21.159 --> 36:24.162
One day I want to be with you,
the next, I don't.

36:25.297 --> 36:26.731
One day I wanna be in love,

36:26.731 --> 36:29.201
and then the next day,
I wanna be alone.

36:29.534 --> 36:32.837
Then, have
a hot girl summer, so...

36:33.572 --> 36:35.140
I've gotta be honest,

36:35.140 --> 36:38.210
I was with you all the way up
until the end.

36:38.977 --> 36:41.112
What the hell is
a "hot girl summer"?

36:41.513 --> 36:42.914
You don't wanna know.

36:44.216 --> 36:46.718
Guess I'll look that up in
the Urban Dictionary.

36:46.718 --> 36:48.787
[Danni] I wouldn't do that.

36:50.322 --> 36:53.124
Okay, Danni,
let me ask you this.

36:53.858 --> 36:57.095
Why do we have to have all of
our choices at once?

36:57.596 --> 37:02.601
[music]

37:02.601 --> 37:03.969
[Preston] I'm just sayin'...

37:04.436 --> 37:05.971
One thing at a time.

37:07.105 --> 37:08.440
Just one, okay?

37:08.974 --> 37:11.910
Let's let it be what
it's supposed to be,

37:12.110 --> 37:13.612
when it's supposed to be.

37:16.548 --> 37:19.217
Well, that's complicated because
I don't...

37:21.353 --> 37:22.954
I don't wanna hurt you.

37:23.955 --> 37:26.925
Well, Danni, you know as well
as anybody...

37:27.158 --> 37:29.160
I'm a big boy.

37:29.427 --> 37:33.932
[music]

37:33.932 --> 37:37.469
Mm, yeah.

37:37.469 --> 37:40.605
I, I know that, but sometimes...

37:41.273 --> 37:45.277
Let me let you know how I feel
about all that, okay?

37:45.944 --> 37:48.546
Don't try to tell me how I feel.

37:49.447 --> 37:51.016
All right?

37:51.016 --> 37:55.053
[music]

37:55.053 --> 37:56.187
Okay.

37:56.187 --> 37:58.189
Now, Danni?

37:59.491 --> 38:03.194
Can I please come inside?

38:03.194 --> 38:07.198
[music]

38:07.198 --> 38:08.533
Yeah.

38:08.933 --> 38:10.902
But we're not doin' anything.

38:11.102 --> 38:12.637
That's fine by me.

38:13.738 --> 38:16.274
[Danni] 'Kay.
Come on.

38:16.274 --> 38:18.910
