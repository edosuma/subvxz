WEBVTT

00:01.505 --> 00:03.139
We believe the resistance
on the part of the consumer

00:03.207 --> 00:04.374
is a function
of the fact

00:04.442 --> 00:06.242
they haven't had a
product to respond to.

00:06.310 --> 00:08.111
Those days are ending.

00:08.179 --> 00:10.080
The technology for the
delivery of hybrid cars

00:10.147 --> 00:11.681
to the marketplace
is ripe.

00:11.749 --> 00:13.750
If the company wants
to stay ahead of the curve,

00:13.818 --> 00:15.785
we should make
an aggressive expansion

00:15.853 --> 00:17.187
into the market.

00:17.254 --> 00:19.856
Now.

00:19.924 --> 00:21.858
Mr. Dubois?

00:21.926 --> 00:24.160
Are you... all right?

00:24.228 --> 00:25.995
Oh, I-I'm fine.

00:26.063 --> 00:27.931
I'm just not sure
why you boys asked me

00:27.998 --> 00:30.800
to cut short my Friday morning
golf game for this.

00:30.868 --> 00:32.702
You know, I'm confused.

00:32.770 --> 00:34.070
You know, while
you were talking,

00:34.138 --> 00:35.872
it sounded to me like

00:35.940 --> 00:38.274
I was in some
socialist country in Europe

00:38.342 --> 00:41.811
and not here in the heart of
the United States of America.

00:41.879 --> 00:44.147
So, let me tell
you something.

00:44.215 --> 00:47.383
Americans love their cars.

00:47.451 --> 00:49.452
The bigger, the better.

00:49.520 --> 00:52.322
They're not worried
about gas mileage.

00:52.389 --> 00:54.791
And they sure as hell
don't want to buy something

00:54.859 --> 00:56.826
that runs on batteries.

00:56.894 --> 00:58.094
(chuckles)

00:58.162 --> 01:00.130
You know what runs on batteries?

01:00.231 --> 01:01.498
Toys.

01:01.565 --> 01:03.466
Sir, gas isn't going to
be inexpensive forever.

01:03.534 --> 01:06.002
It's not happening, guys.

01:06.070 --> 01:09.172
I know you had your hopes
pinned for a promotion

01:09.240 --> 01:10.573
on all this green stuff,

01:10.641 --> 01:13.443
but this is Michigan.

01:13.511 --> 01:15.512
It's not California.

01:15.579 --> 01:17.514
Now, you come back
and you see me

01:17.581 --> 01:19.582
when you remember what company
you're working for.

01:25.456 --> 01:27.791
Sorry to disturb
you, Mr. Dubois.

01:27.858 --> 01:29.592
Some calls came in
during your meeting.

01:29.660 --> 01:31.361
Uh, Mr. Stiles
wants to know why

01:31.428 --> 01:33.129
your division
hasn't reported

01:33.197 --> 01:34.397
on fourth quarter
sales yet.

01:34.465 --> 01:35.832
Well, call him back

01:35.900 --> 01:37.700
and tell him we're still
crunching the numbers.

01:37.768 --> 01:39.402
We'll get the figures soon.

01:39.470 --> 01:41.538
Your ex-wife
called, too.

01:41.605 --> 01:43.239
Oh, great. Now,
what does she want?

01:43.307 --> 01:45.241
She wanted me to remind
you it's three days now

01:45.309 --> 01:46.743
since your son had
his most recent child.

01:46.811 --> 01:49.012
You still haven't called
to say "congratulations."

01:49.079 --> 01:51.648
Uh...

01:51.715 --> 01:53.216
All right, get Joe on the phone.

01:53.284 --> 01:55.351
Do you think this call
would have more weight

01:55.419 --> 01:58.021
if it came
directly from you?

01:58.088 --> 02:00.790
I brought the number.

02:00.858 --> 02:02.859
Uh, Joan?

02:05.062 --> 02:06.429
Is it a boy this time?

02:06.497 --> 02:07.931
A girl.

02:07.998 --> 02:09.765
Her name's Marie.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.835
Oh.

02:15.439 --> 02:18.942
(groaning):
Joan! Joan...!

02:19.009 --> 02:21.544
Joan!

02:21.579 --> 02:22.879
(gasps) Mr. Dubois!

02:22.947 --> 02:24.848
Oh! Mr. Dubois!

02:24.915 --> 02:26.049
Help!

02:26.116 --> 02:27.617
Help! Someone call 911!

02:27.685 --> 02:29.686
(gasps)

02:31.255 --> 02:34.057
Yeah, it's coming up
on seven years

02:34.124 --> 02:35.592
since the big one.

02:35.659 --> 02:38.027
Didn't know I was
just about to call Joe

02:38.095 --> 02:39.696
when it finally happened,
did you, Ally?

02:39.763 --> 02:41.364
No.

02:41.432 --> 02:43.433
What difference does it make?

02:44.935 --> 02:47.337
You know, Marie was
your third grandchild.

02:47.404 --> 02:49.539
You had years to keep in touch.

02:49.607 --> 02:51.574
Now, what do you want?

02:51.642 --> 02:54.177
Well, you know, Joe's not
much younger than I was

02:54.245 --> 02:56.045
when I had my first
heart attack.

02:56.113 --> 02:58.514
And he's two years older
than my father

02:58.582 --> 03:00.583
when he had the heart attack
that killed him.

03:00.651 --> 03:02.485
So?
So...

03:02.553 --> 03:05.889
maybe it wouldn't hurt him
to get himself checked out.

03:05.956 --> 03:08.491
What are you saying?

03:08.559 --> 03:10.260
Is Joe okay?

03:10.327 --> 03:12.462
JOE (groggily):
Joe's fine.

03:12.529 --> 03:14.998
He's just tired.

03:15.065 --> 03:17.901
Why don't you go
back to sleep now?

04:05.807 --> 04:08.507
What are you saying? 
Am I gonna have a heart attack?

04:08.668 --> 04:10.169
No, that's not what I said.

04:10.237 --> 04:12.471
And that's not what he said.
He just--

04:12.539 --> 04:15.775
Not in so many words, he
suggested that, given your age,

04:15.843 --> 04:17.677
and your-your family history,

04:17.744 --> 04:20.146
it might be a good idea
to get it checked out.

04:20.214 --> 04:22.582
No, no, no.

04:22.649 --> 04:24.116
Look, this is what he does.

04:24.184 --> 04:26.052
He just shows up here
out of the blue

04:26.119 --> 04:28.454
and says a bunch of stuff
to scare the crap out of us

04:28.522 --> 04:29.455
and then he disappears.

04:29.523 --> 04:30.890
I don't buy it
for a minute.

04:30.958 --> 04:32.191
Well, I don't know.

04:32.259 --> 04:35.461
Honey, could it really hurt
to just check it out?

04:35.529 --> 04:38.397
I mean, you are almost the exact
same age your father was

04:38.465 --> 04:40.099
when he had
his first heart attack.

04:40.167 --> 04:42.134
Yeah, but he smoked God knows
how many cigars a day

04:42.202 --> 04:43.936
and drank himself
to sleep every night

04:44.004 --> 04:45.304
with malt scotch.

04:45.372 --> 04:47.173
I don't do any
of those things.

04:47.241 --> 04:48.841
Besides,
I just had a physical.

04:48.909 --> 04:51.310
Doctor said I was
in great shape,

04:51.378 --> 04:52.845
and that was,
like, six weeks ago.

04:52.913 --> 04:56.182
I'm sorry. I'm not going
to run around in a panic

04:56.250 --> 04:59.252
every time my dad shows up and
whispers something in your ear

04:59.319 --> 05:00.920
in the wee hours
of the night.

05:00.988 --> 05:02.722
(light switch clicks)
Ow!

05:02.789 --> 05:04.657
What?

05:04.725 --> 05:05.925
You okay?

05:05.993 --> 05:08.694
That-That light. It's...

05:08.762 --> 05:11.163
so bright.

05:11.231 --> 05:14.000
What is going on? Did you change
the bulbs in there or something?

05:14.067 --> 05:16.302
And you want me to see a doctor?

05:16.336 --> 05:18.371
Talk about the pot
calling the kettle black.

05:20.007 --> 05:21.908
SCANLON:
Name's Levar Cole.

05:21.975 --> 05:23.676
He's looking at a third
strike for drug possession.

05:23.744 --> 05:26.545
The thing is, he says he knows
something about a murder

05:26.613 --> 05:28.414
we're investigating,
but he won't say anything else

05:28.482 --> 05:31.484
until we, uh,
guarantee that he'll walk

05:31.551 --> 05:32.718
on the possession charge.

05:32.786 --> 05:34.086
A murder?

05:34.154 --> 05:37.356
Claims that Malcolm and Randy
Littleton are the killers.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.525
The Littleton brothers?

05:39.593 --> 05:41.727
You think he's
telling the truth?

05:41.795 --> 05:44.797
SCANLON:
Hard to say.

05:44.865 --> 05:46.732
Could just be trying to dodge
a mandatory prison sentence

05:46.800 --> 05:48.668
that comes with a
third drug conviction.

05:48.735 --> 05:49.835
But, uh, hey,
if he's willing

05:49.903 --> 05:51.103
to point a finger
at the Littletons,

05:51.171 --> 05:53.472
I figure we should,
uh, hear him out.

05:53.540 --> 05:54.941
I'm sorry. Who
are the Littletons?

05:55.008 --> 05:57.209
DEVALOS:
The city's most notorious
stick-up boys.

05:57.277 --> 05:59.211
They kidnap drug dealers
and then they torture them

05:59.279 --> 06:00.546
until they give
up the location

06:00.614 --> 06:02.481
of the organization's
drug and money stash.

06:02.549 --> 06:04.150
Once the Littletons find
out where everything is,

06:04.217 --> 06:05.251
they pull a smash and grab,

06:05.285 --> 06:06.819
help themselves to the
drugs and the money.

06:06.887 --> 06:08.854
Sounds like a pretty dangerous
way to make a living.

06:08.922 --> 06:10.156
It is.

06:10.223 --> 06:12.091
The Littletons are good at
it. Good enough they got

06:12.159 --> 06:14.460
a quarter of a million dollar
bounty on each of their heads.

06:14.528 --> 06:16.529
Not from us. From
organized crime.

06:17.764 --> 06:20.199
(rustling)

06:21.435 --> 06:22.501
You all right?

06:22.569 --> 06:24.236
Oh, yeah.

06:24.304 --> 06:26.973
I just...
Maybe it's allergies.

06:27.040 --> 06:30.376
I just seem to be so sensitive
to light lately.

06:30.444 --> 06:33.112
I'm looking for my sunglasses.

06:33.180 --> 06:34.447
They're not in here.

06:34.514 --> 06:35.815
Hey, you know what?

06:35.882 --> 06:38.150
Let me check the
lost and found box.

06:44.424 --> 06:47.460
I saw these in
here a couple days ago.

06:47.527 --> 06:48.861
You're welcome
to use these.

06:48.929 --> 06:50.196
No, thanks.
I'll just...

06:50.263 --> 06:52.231
Well, just keep them in
case you change your mind

06:52.299 --> 06:55.634
because otherwise, they're
just going to sit in the box.

06:55.702 --> 06:59.171
I spend most of my
nights in Live Oak Park,

06:59.239 --> 07:01.307
up where the woods
are real thick.

07:01.375 --> 07:04.343
That's where I was last night
a few hours before that

07:04.411 --> 07:06.412
(shouts):
cop picked me up!

07:08.849 --> 07:10.649
I was just sleeping.

07:10.717 --> 07:13.452
I got woke up by some noise.

07:13.520 --> 07:16.255
Two men talking loud.

07:16.323 --> 07:19.525
It was Malcolm
and Randy Littleton.

07:19.593 --> 07:22.762
I could see they were--
they were digging a hole.

07:22.829 --> 07:25.765
And I saw there was something
laying there next to them.

07:25.832 --> 07:27.066
A body.

07:27.134 --> 07:29.668
They were burying a body,

07:29.736 --> 07:32.071
not 15 yards from
where I always sleep?

07:32.139 --> 07:33.806
Uh-uh.

07:33.874 --> 07:35.941
You get a look
at the victim?
No.

07:36.009 --> 07:37.676
But if you let me walk,

07:37.744 --> 07:39.779
I'll tell you exactly
where that body is.

07:39.846 --> 07:41.013
Huh?

07:41.081 --> 07:43.282
In fact, if you need
me to, I'll, uh,

07:43.350 --> 07:45.985
I'll testify against the
Littletons in court.

07:46.053 --> 07:49.989
You're sure these are
the two men you saw?

07:50.057 --> 07:52.958
I don't need pictures
to be sure.

07:53.026 --> 07:54.393
Where I come from,
everyone knows

07:54.461 --> 07:55.995
what Malcolm and Randy
Littleton look like.

07:56.063 --> 07:59.298
All right, Mr. Cole.
If the information

07:59.366 --> 08:01.367
you're providing us is
accurate, I will give you

08:01.435 --> 08:03.969
a suspended sentence
on the drug charge.

08:04.037 --> 08:06.939
But any clemency is
dependent on the arrest

08:07.007 --> 08:09.075
and successful prosecution
of the Littletons.

08:09.142 --> 08:10.342
Mm-hmm.
I understand.

08:10.410 --> 08:12.945
And I promise the
information's good.

08:13.013 --> 08:15.081
In fact, I'll tell you
right where that grave is.

08:15.148 --> 08:18.384
You can go check
it out yourself.

08:19.453 --> 08:20.619
(clears throat)

08:24.691 --> 08:26.425
So, is this man
wasting our time?

08:26.493 --> 08:28.994
I mean, even if he does
know where a body is,

08:29.062 --> 08:30.229
that doesn't
necessarily mean

08:30.297 --> 08:31.697
that the Littletons
put it there.

08:31.765 --> 08:35.234
Oh, I have no idea whether that
man is telling the truth or not.

08:35.302 --> 08:37.303
I mean, I saw a lot of
strange things in there.

08:37.370 --> 08:41.039
I'm not sure they're
related to this case.

08:41.107 --> 08:42.241
(machine beeps)
MARIE:
I'm scared.

08:42.308 --> 08:43.542
Is this going to hurt?

08:43.610 --> 08:47.213
BRIDGETTE: No. I don't
think so, anyway.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.248
(machine beeping)
Hmm?

08:51.384 --> 08:54.053
According to this
machine, you're dead.

08:54.121 --> 08:55.421
You're not dead, sweetie.

08:55.489 --> 08:56.755
Your arm's just too
small for that thing.

08:56.823 --> 08:58.023
It's just meant
for grownups.

08:58.091 --> 08:59.391
Come on, guys. Let's
get out of here.

08:59.459 --> 09:00.559
I got your mom's
refills done.

09:00.627 --> 09:01.961
Dad, you're a grownup.

09:02.028 --> 09:03.162
So?

09:03.230 --> 09:05.431
So, why don't you put
your arm in there?

09:05.499 --> 09:06.732
Yeah, Dad.
Come on.

09:06.800 --> 09:09.168
Let's do this.

09:09.236 --> 09:11.070
BRIDGETTE:
So, are you going to do it?

09:11.138 --> 09:14.607
Sure. Why not?

09:14.674 --> 09:18.144
I bet Dad's rating
doesn't come back "dead."

09:22.649 --> 09:24.250
Okay.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.520
(machine whirring)

09:27.587 --> 09:29.221
(beeping)

09:34.161 --> 09:35.261
Dad...

09:35.328 --> 09:37.196
this machine says that
your blood pressure

09:37.264 --> 09:38.931
is at borderline risk.

09:38.999 --> 09:40.533
What does that mean?

09:40.600 --> 09:43.102
Risk for what?

09:43.170 --> 09:45.671
(phone ringing)

09:50.043 --> 09:51.443
(mutters)

09:56.049 --> 09:59.218
Anything for the inter-office
mail, Ms. Dubois?

09:59.286 --> 10:01.720
You okay?

10:01.788 --> 10:03.622
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine, Doug.

10:03.690 --> 10:04.657
(chuckles nervously)

10:04.724 --> 10:06.592
Um...
Thanks.

10:06.660 --> 10:09.328
No, I-I'm fine
for office mail today.

10:09.396 --> 10:11.664
(chuckles)

10:18.004 --> 10:19.171
DEVALOS:
Allison.

10:20.507 --> 10:21.640
Your eyes still
bothering you?

10:21.708 --> 10:23.576
The glasses are helping.

10:23.643 --> 10:25.377
I just got off
the phone with Lee.

10:25.445 --> 10:27.780
Apparently, Levar Cole
was telling us the truth,

10:27.847 --> 10:29.181
at least about one thing.

10:29.249 --> 10:31.383
They did find a body buried
out in Live Oak Park,

10:31.451 --> 10:33.085
and it was right where
he said it would be.

10:33.153 --> 10:35.187
I'm on my way over
to the morgue.

10:35.255 --> 10:37.256
Can I hitch a ride?

10:39.559 --> 10:40.726
We ID'd the body.

10:40.794 --> 10:43.262
Low-level drug dealer
named Juan Espinal.

10:43.330 --> 10:46.465
Best guess? The Littleton
brothers got a hold of him.

10:46.533 --> 10:48.834
Tried to shake him down
for inside scoop

10:48.902 --> 10:50.402
on the people he worked for.

10:50.470 --> 10:51.537
Maybe he didn't
cooperate.

10:51.605 --> 10:53.205
Maybe the Littletons
didn't like

10:53.273 --> 10:54.707
what he had to say.

10:54.774 --> 10:57.042
Either way,
he ended up here.

11:02.182 --> 11:03.649
What's with the hairnet?

11:03.717 --> 11:05.951
That was there when
we dug him up.

11:06.019 --> 11:08.654
I don't know.
Fashion, I guess.

11:08.722 --> 11:10.322
Allison, what are you doing?

11:12.259 --> 11:14.326
ALLISON:
Zero.

11:14.394 --> 11:17.196
He's dead. He's got zero days
left to live.

11:17.264 --> 11:18.864
I beg your pardon?

11:18.932 --> 11:20.065
Oh, my God.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.834
That man we interviewed--

11:21.901 --> 11:24.136
the one who said he
would testify against
the Littleton brothers.

11:24.204 --> 11:25.571
Levar Cole.
What about him?

11:25.639 --> 11:27.339
His number was one.

11:27.407 --> 11:29.174
I don't follow.

11:29.242 --> 11:31.043
You have to make sure
that man is safe.

11:31.111 --> 11:32.378
Levar Cole's in county,
pending release.

11:32.445 --> 11:33.679
He's not going anywhere.

11:33.747 --> 11:35.981
I'm not worried about
him getting away.

11:36.049 --> 11:38.083
I'm worried something is going
to happen to him.

11:38.151 --> 11:40.185
Please, you have to make sure
that he's safe.

11:40.253 --> 11:42.187
(cell phone dialing)

11:44.224 --> 11:45.991
Yeah, uh,
this is Detective Scanlon.

11:46.059 --> 11:48.027
I'm calling in regards
to a Levar Cole.

11:48.094 --> 11:50.229
I'm coming in to process
his release later today.

11:50.297 --> 11:53.165
I just want to make sure
everything's all set.

11:59.739 --> 12:01.807
What?

12:01.875 --> 12:04.610
What'd they say?

12:04.678 --> 12:06.912
Just happened
20 minutes ago.

12:06.980 --> 12:09.348
A fight broke out
in the prison cafeteria.

12:09.416 --> 12:11.984
Levar Cole was stabbed
with a shiv.

12:12.052 --> 12:13.786
He's dead.

12:21.837 --> 12:23.204
JOE:
Al, are you in there?

12:23.272 --> 12:25.673
(gasps)

12:25.941 --> 12:27.608
Don't turn the light on.

12:27.676 --> 12:29.977
And close the door, please.

12:31.947 --> 12:35.850
Al, I think it's time
we get you to a doctor.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.284
I mean, if this is bad enough

12:37.352 --> 12:39.420
that I have to come get
you from work...

12:39.488 --> 12:42.890
Honey, I don't even know
what I would say to the
doctor at this point.

12:42.958 --> 12:45.159
And that's not even
the worst of it.

12:45.227 --> 12:46.927
Just get me in the elevator.

12:46.995 --> 12:48.863
Get me outside
into the darkness.

12:48.930 --> 12:51.332
And then I'll tell
you everything.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.235
The days that a person
has left to live?

12:54.336 --> 12:55.836
That's a pretty
dramatic statement.

12:55.904 --> 12:58.172
Yeah, but I'm telling you,
I think I'm right.

12:58.240 --> 13:01.175
I mean, at first when I put
these sunglasses on,

13:01.243 --> 13:04.445
and I looked at people,
I could see these five-digit
numbers floating around

13:04.513 --> 13:06.080
on their foreheads.

13:06.148 --> 13:08.215
Devalos, Scanlon.

13:08.283 --> 13:10.084
Later when we were
at the morgue,

13:10.152 --> 13:12.953
all the corpses--
they all had zeros.

13:13.021 --> 13:16.724
I know it sounds crazy,
but I can't make sense of it,

13:16.792 --> 13:18.125
but there it is.

13:18.193 --> 13:21.662
You telling me that if you look
at me through those glasses,

13:21.730 --> 13:24.165
you can tell me how long
I have left to live?

13:24.266 --> 13:25.833
Don't ask me to do that.

13:25.901 --> 13:29.036
Well, aren't you the person
who's saying my dead father's

13:29.104 --> 13:31.439
raising all these
questions about my health?

13:31.506 --> 13:32.606
Yeah, but...

13:32.674 --> 13:33.908
But what?

13:33.975 --> 13:36.110
Yeah, but I don't
want to know that.

13:36.178 --> 13:38.345
I mean... not like that.

13:38.413 --> 13:40.314
If you think about it
for a second,

13:40.382 --> 13:41.982
you don't either.

13:45.821 --> 13:47.888
Do you know who we are?

13:50.692 --> 13:53.994
Do you know
why you're here?

13:54.062 --> 13:56.330
Good.

13:56.398 --> 13:58.065
So you know how
important it is

13:58.133 --> 14:00.701
for you to answer the questions
that we're about to ask you.

14:03.872 --> 14:05.773
Juan Espinal.

14:05.841 --> 14:08.676
You deal smack
for Hector Becerra.

14:08.744 --> 14:12.113
In fact, you're his top-earning
corner boy, am I right?

14:12.180 --> 14:14.548
Yeah, that's right.

14:14.616 --> 14:18.385
So now that we
all know each other, Juan,

14:18.453 --> 14:20.921
I want you to tell
me and my brother here

14:20.989 --> 14:23.124
all about Hector's
stash houses.

14:23.191 --> 14:24.492
The ones on the east side.

14:24.559 --> 14:27.962
Come on, man,
you know I can't do that.

14:28.029 --> 14:30.231
Juan...

14:30.298 --> 14:31.766
Juan.

14:31.833 --> 14:33.968
I thought you said you
knew who we were.

14:34.035 --> 14:37.638
Look, I-I know you guys
is for real,

14:37.706 --> 14:39.774
but if I tell you about
them stash houses,

14:39.841 --> 14:41.475
my own people  will kill me.

14:41.543 --> 14:44.612
Ain't nobody got to know
it was you.

14:44.679 --> 14:48.449
Come on, look, my brother
Randy, he don't talk much.

14:48.517 --> 14:51.318
And I ain't gonna
tell nobody.

14:53.989 --> 14:55.156
Juan...

14:55.223 --> 14:59.160
Come on now.

14:59.227 --> 15:00.394
You know you gonna tell us

15:00.462 --> 15:02.730
everything we want
to know, right?

15:02.798 --> 15:04.532
Right?

15:09.371 --> 15:10.504
Come here.

15:10.572 --> 15:12.273
(muffled sobbing)

15:14.342 --> 15:19.580
Okay, Juan, we're gonna see
just how long you can hold out.

15:25.287 --> 15:27.188
(screaming)

15:30.091 --> 15:32.026
<i>DEVALOS:
Unfortunately, what you saw</i>

15:32.093 --> 15:34.228
in your dream actually makes a
lot of sense.

15:34.296 --> 15:36.664
A couple of Hector Becerra's
stash houses

15:36.731 --> 15:37.798
were robbed last week.

15:37.866 --> 15:40.401
Not to mention
the coroner pointed out

15:40.468 --> 15:43.070
a fresh wound on
Juan Espinal's right bicep.

15:43.138 --> 15:46.173
It certainly could have been
inflicted by a sander.

15:46.241 --> 15:47.875
Well, I don't understand.

15:47.943 --> 15:49.009
I read the Littletons' file.

15:49.077 --> 15:50.978
I thought they operated
by some kind of code

15:51.046 --> 15:53.781
where they'd kidnap someone,
and if that person gave

15:53.849 --> 15:55.516
them good information,
they'd let them go.

15:55.584 --> 15:59.920
If Juan Espinal talked--
if he told them the location

15:59.988 --> 16:02.590
of the stash houses--
why would they kill him?

16:02.657 --> 16:05.793
Maybe the Littletons are
playing by a new set of rules.

16:05.861 --> 16:07.695
No witnesses.

16:07.762 --> 16:13.000
In any case, I'm going to
go canvas the city for
abandoned barbershops.

16:13.068 --> 16:15.569
If that's where the brothers
tortured and killed

16:15.637 --> 16:18.706
Juan Espinal, maybe I can
find some evidence to tie
them to the crime.

16:18.773 --> 16:21.342
Keep us posted.

16:21.409 --> 16:24.044
You know, yesterday,
you wouldn't even
put those things on.

16:24.112 --> 16:27.047
Now it's like
they're glued to you.

16:27.115 --> 16:29.316
Yeah. Yeah, it looks that way.

16:31.586 --> 16:33.520
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Paging Dr. Bender, please.

16:33.588 --> 16:35.422
Well, it's a little elevated,

16:35.490 --> 16:37.024
but blood pressure
varies day to day.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.859
I don't think it's anything
to be alarmed about.

16:38.927 --> 16:40.127
I'm okay?

16:40.195 --> 16:42.129
Hey, based on my family history,

16:42.197 --> 16:45.733
is there anything that I should
be doing to avoid heart trouble?

16:45.800 --> 16:47.534
It's a lot about
life choices, Joe.

16:47.602 --> 16:50.037
I mean, the good news is
you don't smoke,

16:50.105 --> 16:51.972
you're at your ideal weight,
married, employed.

16:52.040 --> 16:54.875
d say
you're doing great.

16:54.943 --> 16:57.311
Do you have any
undue stress in your life?

16:57.412 --> 16:58.913
You mentioned your wife
had been ill.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.347
Yeah, but she's doing
great now.

17:00.415 --> 17:02.349
Um, I mean, I just started
a new job.

17:02.417 --> 17:04.084
I guess that probably
added some stress.

17:04.152 --> 17:06.520
Well, I mean, there
is another thing

17:06.588 --> 17:08.289
that can make a
major difference

17:08.356 --> 17:09.890
in stress and
blood pressure levels.

17:09.958 --> 17:12.693
Particularly for people
with stressful jobs.

17:12.761 --> 17:16.063
You ever tried meditation?

17:16.131 --> 17:19.066
What do you mean,
like chanting?

17:19.134 --> 17:21.468
No, not necessarily, anyway.

17:21.536 --> 17:24.805
You set aside some chunks
of time during the day.

17:24.873 --> 17:26.807
Focus on your breathing,
clear your mind.

17:26.875 --> 17:29.276
Just try to stay totally
present in the moment.

17:29.344 --> 17:32.413
(chuckles)
I know what
you're thinking.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.881
I was right there with you.

17:33.949 --> 17:37.518
Believe me, I'm no hippie,
but I gave it a shot.

17:37.585 --> 17:39.553
It really helps.

18:11.086 --> 18:13.153
(phone ringing)

18:13.221 --> 18:14.355
Hello.

18:14.422 --> 18:16.256
Allison, it's Manuel.

18:16.324 --> 18:18.025
I'm going to give you
an address.

18:18.093 --> 18:19.793
I need you to come
right over here.

18:19.861 --> 18:21.462
Mr. District Attorney,
what's going on?

18:21.529 --> 18:23.564
Lee found that barbershop
you saw in your dream.

18:23.631 --> 18:26.000
He crossed paths with one
of the Littleton brothers.

18:26.067 --> 18:27.968
Lee shot him.

18:28.036 --> 18:30.037
(siren wailing)

18:43.418 --> 18:45.219
Allison, thanks
for coming.

18:45.286 --> 18:47.021
I came as quick
as I could.

18:49.190 --> 18:50.991
Have you
seen Lee yet?

18:51.059 --> 18:52.126
No, where is he?

18:52.193 --> 18:54.061
He's out back, I think,

18:54.129 --> 18:56.463
filing a statement
with Internal Affairs.

18:56.531 --> 18:57.531
I don't understand.

18:57.599 --> 18:58.699
What was Littleton
doing here?

18:58.767 --> 18:59.967
Why were shots even fired?

19:00.035 --> 19:02.669
Apparently, Lee pulled up
to take a look around

19:02.771 --> 19:05.472
just as Littleton here
was in the process of leaving.

19:05.540 --> 19:07.975
Lee got out of his car,
identified himself

19:08.043 --> 19:09.643
and Randy went for his gun.

19:09.711 --> 19:12.046
We've already found
weapons, drugs.

19:12.113 --> 19:15.215
Apparently they were
using this place

19:15.283 --> 19:17.151
as a kind of base of operations.

19:17.218 --> 19:18.318
Is Lee all right?

19:18.386 --> 19:19.820
Not a mark on him.

19:19.888 --> 19:22.623
Any signs of the other
Littleton brother?

19:22.690 --> 19:23.791
No.

19:23.858 --> 19:25.459
But with Randy dead,
I have a feeling

19:25.527 --> 19:27.027
that Malcolm might try
to retaliate soon.

19:27.095 --> 19:28.095
What do you
mean retaliate?

19:28.163 --> 19:29.263
SCANLON:
I hope you two didn't come

19:29.330 --> 19:30.697
all the way down
here on my account.

19:30.765 --> 19:33.033
I'm touched.

19:33.101 --> 19:34.435
Oh, my God.

19:34.502 --> 19:35.502
Lee...

19:35.570 --> 19:37.471
It's okay, Allison, I'm fine.

19:37.539 --> 19:40.040
Really, there's not
a scratch on me.

19:45.795 --> 19:46.795
Gee, two days to live, huh?

19:46.862 --> 19:48.496
I don't know what
to tell you, Allison.

19:48.564 --> 19:50.999
If you could see your way
clear to give me a week,

19:51.067 --> 19:53.702
maybe I'd cash in my 401K,
take a trip to Maui, but...

19:53.769 --> 19:55.437
Lee...
...given the scheduling
crunch...

19:55.504 --> 19:57.272
Lee, I need you
to listen to me.

19:57.340 --> 19:58.473
I'm serious.

19:58.541 --> 19:59.941
I mean, think about it.

20:00.009 --> 20:02.310
Randy Littleton is dead, and his
brother is still out there.

20:02.378 --> 20:04.679
He's going to want to get
the man who did this.

20:04.747 --> 20:05.947
He's going to want
to get revenge.

20:06.015 --> 20:09.084
Don't do that.
Don't just shrug.

20:09.151 --> 20:11.386
Think about Lynn.
Think about the baby.

20:11.454 --> 20:12.620
All right, I'm thinking
about them.

20:12.688 --> 20:14.589
Now what is it you want
me to do? I'm a cop.

20:14.657 --> 20:17.025
Every day I go out there,
I try to put away a bad guy.

20:17.093 --> 20:18.226
Knowing that I could be
ticking off

20:18.294 --> 20:19.461
another bad guy in the process.

20:19.528 --> 20:20.628
That's just part of the job.

20:20.696 --> 20:22.564
And besides, all
you're seeing is a number.

20:22.631 --> 20:24.733
It's not like it's telling
you something specific

20:24.800 --> 20:26.735
that I can prepare for
or guard against.

20:26.802 --> 20:28.670
And for all you know,
it could be that I slip

20:28.738 --> 20:30.238
in the shower tomorrow
and crack my skull open.

20:30.306 --> 20:31.740
I don't think so.

20:31.807 --> 20:34.843
Look, the bottom line is, if I
want to avoid being murdered

20:34.910 --> 20:36.411
by Malcolm Littleton,
than my best option

20:36.479 --> 20:39.414
is to work the case and try to
make sure that we find him

20:39.482 --> 20:41.116
and put him away
as soon as possible.

20:41.183 --> 20:43.952
Besides, it's not like
I'm flying blind.

20:44.019 --> 20:46.988
I found this on Randy Littleton.

20:47.056 --> 20:48.556
Now this guy
and his brother

20:48.624 --> 20:50.325
they tracked every drug
dealer in Phoenix

20:50.393 --> 20:51.593
at one time or another.

20:51.660 --> 20:53.228
And it's all written down
right here.

20:53.295 --> 20:55.563
This book's going to be
worth a lot to someone.

20:55.631 --> 20:57.465
And I can use this
to find Malcolm.

20:58.968 --> 21:02.103
Or I could just
stay home from work.

21:02.171 --> 21:06.174
Not take a shower,
not get out of bed.

21:06.242 --> 21:07.609
Help me out with this one,
Allison.

21:07.676 --> 21:09.277
Eenie-meenie-minie-mo?

21:17.787 --> 21:19.687
(sighs)

21:28.898 --> 21:31.166
(door opening)

21:33.469 --> 21:34.736
Is this gonna bother you?

21:34.804 --> 21:36.204
I can read outside
if you'd like.

21:36.272 --> 21:37.539
No, it's fine.

21:37.606 --> 21:39.707
I'm just gonna
shut my eyes anyway.

21:45.881 --> 21:47.849
Ugh, who am I kidding?

21:47.917 --> 21:50.785
Okay, I'll go read
in the living room.

21:50.853 --> 21:52.220
Wait, no, honey,
it's not the light.

21:52.288 --> 21:53.955
It's Lee.

21:54.023 --> 21:57.125
He's running out of time and I
don't know what to do about it.

21:57.193 --> 21:59.661
Well, I don't know that
there's anything to do.

21:59.728 --> 22:01.496
And I also don't know that

22:01.564 --> 22:03.765
you're absolutely
running out of time.

22:03.833 --> 22:05.600
I don't know how
you can be saying that.

22:05.668 --> 22:06.901
Well, think about it.

22:06.969 --> 22:09.304
Okay, so, yesterday
you look through your glasses

22:09.371 --> 22:11.840
and he had however many
thousands of days left.

22:11.907 --> 22:14.843
Today your glasses
tell you it's only two.

22:14.910 --> 22:16.377
So, clearly, things can change.

22:16.445 --> 22:18.146
Tomorrow's a new day--
who knows

22:18.214 --> 22:19.647
what your glasses
are gonna tell you?

22:19.715 --> 22:22.617
And if the police catch
this Littleton guy,

22:22.685 --> 22:24.752
then it kind of
stands to reason

22:24.820 --> 22:27.889
that Scanlon's number's
gonna shoot right back up
to where it was before.

22:27.957 --> 22:29.557
Well, what if
they don't catch him?

22:29.625 --> 22:32.727
Well, then, then we just
gotta deal with that.

22:32.795 --> 22:35.597
The point is you can't actually
know what these numbers

22:35.664 --> 22:37.999
are gonna be tomorrow until
tomorrow actually gets here.

22:38.067 --> 22:41.836
That's very Zen of you.
And I'm only on chapter one.

22:41.904 --> 22:43.905
How do you feel?

22:43.973 --> 22:45.640
The whole thing
makes me nervous.

22:45.708 --> 22:47.675
I gotta sit there
and do nothing?

22:47.743 --> 22:50.278
Call me crazy;
I don't find that relaxing.

22:50.346 --> 22:52.080
Well, honey, it's like anything.

22:52.147 --> 22:55.917
You just gotta do it a few times
before you get the hang of it.

22:55.985 --> 22:58.386
Yeah, the book says I gotta
do it three times a day.

22:58.454 --> 23:01.990
That means I gotta go meditate
in the middle of work.

23:02.057 --> 23:03.424
I'm just not the kind of guy

23:03.492 --> 23:05.793
that's gonna turn
to my colleagues

23:05.861 --> 23:09.664
and say, "Excuse me, but, uh,
I'll be back in ten minutes.

23:09.732 --> 23:13.067
"I just gotta go seeking
enlightenment now."

23:13.135 --> 23:14.602
Relax.

23:14.670 --> 23:16.104
You don't need enlightenment.

23:16.171 --> 23:18.706
You just need to lower
your blood pressure.

23:24.613 --> 23:25.713
(car horn honking)

23:25.781 --> 23:27.582
MAN:
Hey, yo, Juan!

23:27.650 --> 23:29.017
Hey.

23:33.188 --> 23:34.622
What's up?
What's up, man?

23:34.690 --> 23:35.690
You good?
Yeah.

23:35.758 --> 23:37.458
I've been looking
for you, man.

23:37.526 --> 23:40.295
Hector sent me to
come and get you.
Oh, yeah,
what's Hector want?

23:40.362 --> 23:41.896
Ah, he just wants
to talk to you

23:41.964 --> 23:43.765
about the Littleton boys
hitting up our stash houses.

23:43.832 --> 23:45.333
You kidding me?

23:45.401 --> 23:47.035
I don't know anything
about that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

23:47.102 --> 23:48.970
But you know Hector, man,
he'd feel a lot better

23:49.038 --> 23:50.805
if he heard that
right from you.
Yeah.

23:50.873 --> 23:53.308
Why don't you get in the car,
homie? We'll go see him.

23:53.375 --> 23:56.077
Man, I gotta be out
on my corner, man, you know.
Corner...

23:56.145 --> 23:58.346
Customers expect me, I mean,
how else am I gonna sell?

23:58.414 --> 24:00.548
You know Hector would rather
have me out there earning

24:00.616 --> 24:02.183
than wasting my time
coming to see him.

24:02.251 --> 24:03.618
Oh, for sure, yeah.

24:03.686 --> 24:05.086
See, the problem is though,

24:05.154 --> 24:07.355
Hector knows that you are not
always on that corner, right?

24:07.423 --> 24:10.291
'Cause the other day,
in fact, you weren't selling.

24:10.359 --> 24:12.594
I mean, nobody knew
where you were.

24:12.661 --> 24:15.163
Cesar, I was sick,
man, come on.
Sick.

24:15.230 --> 24:17.031
Ain't you ever
had to take a sick day?

24:17.099 --> 24:19.467
Sick? Look, man.

24:19.535 --> 24:21.202
You know who don't
ever take sick days?

24:21.270 --> 24:23.504
The Littleton brothers
don't ever take sick days

24:23.572 --> 24:26.841
because they're always
working, man, always.

24:26.909 --> 24:29.544
Even when nobody could find you,
the Littletons were working.

24:29.612 --> 24:32.146
I already told you, I don't know
anything about the Littletons.

24:32.214 --> 24:35.149
Come on, man, you know
something, right, hmm?

24:35.217 --> 24:36.851
You heard the stories.

24:36.919 --> 24:39.487
They kidnap you,
they tie you up,

24:39.555 --> 24:42.357
ask you questions
and when you can't answer...

24:42.424 --> 24:43.858
They break out that belt sander,

24:43.926 --> 24:47.495
just grind, man,
tear that meat out.

24:47.563 --> 24:51.032
The way I hear,
they start with your arm.

24:51.100 --> 24:53.501
Right about here.

24:53.569 --> 24:56.070
(groaning)
Huh, is that it?

25:00.142 --> 25:02.010
Get him!

25:26.001 --> 25:29.003
¶ ¶

25:38.147 --> 25:40.348
(sighing)

25:40.416 --> 25:42.016
Looks like it's about that time.

25:42.084 --> 25:43.885
Some of us are grabbing pizza
for lunch.

25:43.952 --> 25:45.253
You wanna come with?

25:45.320 --> 25:46.587
No, thanks, man. I'm...

25:46.655 --> 25:48.122
I'm brown-bagging it today.

25:48.190 --> 25:49.624
No worries, man.

25:49.692 --> 25:50.892
See you in a bit.

26:20.456 --> 26:22.790
Okay.

26:22.858 --> 26:25.326
All right, ouch.

26:25.427 --> 26:27.662
Okay, here goes nothing.

26:29.131 --> 26:31.766
(sighs)

26:31.834 --> 26:34.836
Om...

26:36.171 --> 26:38.806
Om...

26:40.809 --> 26:42.910
Om...
Uh, you're sitting in my spot.

26:42.978 --> 26:45.346
Say again?

26:45.414 --> 26:47.281
You're sitting in my spot.

26:49.284 --> 26:51.753
Oh, I-I'm sorry.
Were you...

26:51.820 --> 26:54.288
Were you meditating?
It was hard to tell,
but now I'm thinking

26:54.356 --> 26:56.090
maybe you were meditating.
Oh, no, yeah.

26:56.158 --> 26:57.925
No, no, I, I just...

26:57.993 --> 27:00.094
I don't know, I guess
I was just looking for,

27:00.162 --> 27:01.896
uh, you know, a quiet
place to sit for a while.

27:01.964 --> 27:03.231
Well, you found
the right place.

27:03.298 --> 27:04.966
I come out here almost
every day right before lunch.

27:05.033 --> 27:05.967
Oh, yeah?

27:06.034 --> 27:07.502
You work here?
Yeah.

27:07.569 --> 27:09.737
Uh, Joe Dubois.

27:09.805 --> 27:11.706
Dan Burroughs.

27:13.442 --> 27:15.943
Dan Burroughs, as in...

27:16.011 --> 27:17.578
Burroughs and Strauss?

27:17.646 --> 27:20.481
Yeah.
You're my boss.

27:20.549 --> 27:23.885
And I was, uh...

27:23.952 --> 27:25.520
Yeah, I was sitting
in your lunch spot.

27:25.587 --> 27:28.156
Um, I lied.

27:28.223 --> 27:31.025
My name is not Joe Dubois,
and I do not work over there.

27:31.093 --> 27:33.127
Listen, it's all right,
it's a public place.

27:33.195 --> 27:34.529
I'll go someplace else.
No.

27:34.596 --> 27:35.930
No, no, you go ahead

27:35.998 --> 27:37.498
and do whatever
you're doing, I guess.

27:37.566 --> 27:40.168
It's all right.

27:40.235 --> 27:42.236
(sighs)

27:47.910 --> 27:49.177
<i>SCANLON:
You've reached the cell phone</i>

27:49.244 --> 27:50.178
of Detective Lee Scanlon.

27:50.245 --> 27:52.780
If this is an emergency,
dial 9-1-1.

27:52.848 --> 27:54.982
If not, leave a message
after the beep.

27:55.050 --> 27:56.717
(beeping)
Uh, hey, hey.

27:56.785 --> 27:57.985
Lee, it's Allison.

27:58.053 --> 28:00.254
I've been trying to get
a hold of you all day.

28:00.322 --> 28:02.523
I guess we're just not destined
to run into one another.

28:02.591 --> 28:03.958
So, here's the thing.

28:04.026 --> 28:05.626
I'm not sure that Juan Espinal

28:05.694 --> 28:08.162
was killed by the Littletons
at all.

28:08.230 --> 28:10.431
Uh, it seems that
the people that he worked for

28:10.499 --> 28:11.899
had it in for him, too.

28:11.967 --> 28:16.737
Oh, and, uh, I'm not sure
that this matters or not,

28:16.805 --> 28:19.674
but you know those sunglasses
I've been wearing?

28:19.741 --> 28:21.876
I think they actually
belonged to Espinal.

28:21.910 --> 28:24.712
I have no idea why
or how they made their way

28:24.780 --> 28:27.515
into the lost and found
at the police station, but...

28:27.583 --> 28:29.917
I think they were actually his.

28:29.985 --> 28:32.220
Hey, when you get this
can you give me a call?

28:32.287 --> 28:33.921
'Cause I'm just
worried about you.

28:33.989 --> 28:35.923
And I wanna make sure
you're all right.

28:35.991 --> 28:38.159
DEVALOS:
Allison.

28:38.193 --> 28:40.428
Forward your calls; I think
you're gonna want to join me.

28:40.495 --> 28:42.630
Where are we going?
The morgue.

28:43.665 --> 28:45.633
DEVALOS:
Malcolm Littleton.

28:45.701 --> 28:48.302
He was found lying
on the sidewalk

28:48.370 --> 28:50.838
at the corner of Blossom and
Sycamore at 6:00 this morning.

28:50.906 --> 28:52.106
Nobody touched the body,

28:52.174 --> 28:54.041
even though it had
been there for hours.

28:54.109 --> 28:57.345
And near as we can determine,
there were no eyewitnesses.

28:57.412 --> 28:58.512
And you believe that?

28:58.580 --> 29:01.249
I'd be surprised if
anyone came forward.

29:01.316 --> 29:03.551
Littleton robbed
dozens of drug dealers.

29:03.619 --> 29:05.253
It's not a stretch
to imagine that

29:05.320 --> 29:07.021
one of them finally
caught up with him.

29:07.089 --> 29:08.656
Even if someone
did see something,

29:08.724 --> 29:11.225
I doubt that anyone would
testify against drug dealers

29:11.293 --> 29:13.761
in an open court for the
likes of Malcolm Littleton.

29:13.829 --> 29:15.863
(door opening)

29:15.931 --> 29:19.000
I guess somebody caught up
with Malcolm before I could.

29:19.067 --> 29:20.501
Just heard the news
on the radio.

29:22.704 --> 29:25.473
Gotta be good news for
my prognosis though, right?

29:37.674 --> 29:39.974
You want some sun tan lotion
 for your back?

29:40.854 --> 29:42.688
Oh, don't make fun.

29:42.756 --> 29:45.424
It's nice out here, and I don't
have to wear my sunglasses.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.327
I can just... I can just be.

29:48.395 --> 29:50.529
Hmm, boy, I envy

29:50.597 --> 29:53.332
your sense of contentment.

29:53.400 --> 29:56.068
I, on the other hand,
am filled with angst...

29:56.136 --> 29:58.504
knowing that I made a complete
imbecile out of myself

29:58.572 --> 30:01.307
in front of the man who owns
the company that I work for.

30:01.374 --> 30:03.375
By the way,
I'm changing doctors.

30:03.443 --> 30:05.377
And I hate my father.

30:05.445 --> 30:06.879
And how are you?

30:06.947 --> 30:09.348
You know, you're really making a
mountain out of a molehill here.

30:09.416 --> 30:11.584
How do you know Burroughs
even cares if you meditate

30:11.651 --> 30:13.986
during your lunch hour?
I don't know.

30:14.054 --> 30:15.654
Maybe he doesn't.

30:15.722 --> 30:17.556
I just worry that
for the rest of time

30:17.624 --> 30:19.425
he's gonna think of me
as that odd fellow

30:19.492 --> 30:23.996
who was dithering
in his spot during lunch.

30:24.064 --> 30:26.799
Are you expecting
an urgent call?

30:29.402 --> 30:32.071
The Scanlon hotline?

30:32.138 --> 30:33.606
I hate this.

30:33.673 --> 30:35.074
Stupid sunglasses.

30:35.141 --> 30:36.642
They don't tell you
what's gonna happen,

30:36.710 --> 30:38.711
only when it's almost here.

30:38.778 --> 30:40.412
I don't get it.

30:40.513 --> 30:41.881
Both of the Littleton brothers
are dead.

30:41.948 --> 30:43.549
Why does Lee still
have a number one

30:43.617 --> 30:44.850
floating around his forehead?

30:44.918 --> 30:48.487
Well, you can only control
what you can control.

30:50.991 --> 30:53.559
At least I convinced him
not to come in to work tomorrow.

30:53.627 --> 30:56.695
He's gonna take the day off.

30:56.763 --> 30:59.064
I don't know,
maybe that'll make a difference.

30:59.132 --> 31:00.799
Who knows? I guess we'll see.

31:00.867 --> 31:02.401
Well, speaking of tomorrow,

31:02.469 --> 31:05.237
what do you say
we call it a day?

31:08.909 --> 31:11.176
(chuckling)

31:13.013 --> 31:14.947
(siren wailing)

31:15.015 --> 31:17.516
¶ ¶

31:19.452 --> 31:20.953
You Juan?

31:21.021 --> 31:24.323
What, you don't remember me?

31:24.391 --> 31:26.792
You arrested me twice
for possession with intent.

31:26.860 --> 31:29.828
I arrest a lot of people, Juan.

31:29.896 --> 31:32.298
I got a message you wanted
to talk to me. What's up?

31:32.365 --> 31:33.666
I'm in trouble.

31:33.733 --> 31:35.501
The people I work for,
they, they think

31:35.568 --> 31:37.036
I gave them up
to the Littletons.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.771
I can't go home;
I can't go anywhere.

31:38.838 --> 31:40.572
So I'm coming to you,
maybe we can work a deal.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.174
I'll give you information
on my people.

31:42.242 --> 31:44.243
I'll even tell you what
I know about the Littletons.

31:44.311 --> 31:48.714
As long as you can
promise me protection.

31:48.782 --> 31:50.749
Sounds like we got
a lot to talk about.

31:50.817 --> 31:52.384
Why don't you get in?

31:58.158 --> 32:01.360
Just give me a second, Juan.

32:01.428 --> 32:03.762
I gotta make a call to
one of my colleagues.

32:03.830 --> 32:06.665
Yeah, Detective Carver here.

32:06.733 --> 32:09.301
I have Juan Espinal
with me right now.

32:09.369 --> 32:11.837
Yeah, no, the
message was right.

32:11.905 --> 32:13.205
He wants to talk.

32:13.273 --> 32:16.842
He'll give us Becerra,
the Littletons, everybody.

32:16.910 --> 32:19.912
I'm bringing him
in right now.

32:25.085 --> 32:28.921
We'll take your statement
when we get to the precinct.

32:32.792 --> 32:34.259
So, did you?

32:36.096 --> 32:39.531
Did you give up information
to the Littleton brothers?

32:41.735 --> 32:45.437
Hey... they came at me
with a sander, man.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.673
I don't get paid enough to deal
with that.

32:57.517 --> 32:59.752
Where we going, anyway?

32:59.819 --> 33:03.355
I just gotta make a quick stop,
pick someone up.

33:14.667 --> 33:18.103
(muffled groaning)

33:20.507 --> 33:22.241
(muffled gasp)

33:22.308 --> 33:24.910
(phone rings)

33:32.819 --> 33:33.752
(knock at door)

33:33.820 --> 33:35.087
Just a minute!
(hangs up)

33:42.162 --> 33:43.796
(sighs)

33:45.298 --> 33:47.733
Hey, Lee, uh, sorry
to bother you at home.

33:47.801 --> 33:49.368
I know you-you got a kid now,

33:49.436 --> 33:51.303
but dispatch said you
weren't coming in?

33:51.371 --> 33:53.672
that's okay.
Uh, the baby's with her mom.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.307
Come on in.

33:55.375 --> 33:57.342
(ringing resumes)

33:57.410 --> 33:59.578
Listen, uh, I'll
get right to it.
(hangs up)

33:59.646 --> 34:01.847
I read the report about the
Randy Littleton shooting,

34:01.915 --> 34:04.316
and it said you, uh, pulled
a notebook off the body?

34:04.384 --> 34:06.251
Yeah, that's right.

34:06.319 --> 34:07.686
Well, I got to tell you,

34:07.754 --> 34:10.656
as the head of
the anti-gang task force,

34:10.723 --> 34:14.426
uh... that thing is like the
Rosetta Stone of gang activity

34:14.427 --> 34:18.263
here in Phoenix.

34:18.331 --> 34:19.264
d,"... that thing is like the
RosettaIt's not there.activity

34:19.331 --> 34:20.766
(ringing resumes)

34:20.833 --> 34:22.734
You need to get that?
(hangs up)

34:22.802 --> 34:24.770
I can ca her right back.

34:24.838 --> 34:27.539
Uh, yeah, I do have that, uh,
that notebook here somewhere.

34:27.607 --> 34:30.141
I was gonna go through it one
more time and, uh...

34:30.210 --> 34:33.679
make a list of initials, names,
basically anyone I can question.

34:33.746 --> 34:35.514
Question about what?

34:35.581 --> 34:37.483
Malcolm Littleton's murder.

34:37.550 --> 34:39.150
Why, you gonna give the guy

34:39.219 --> 34:41.018
who pulled the trigger
a commendation?

34:41.087 --> 34:42.721
(laughter)

34:42.789 --> 34:45.023
Well, it's a homicide, right?

34:45.091 --> 34:48.293
But if you think this thing'll
give you a leg up, um...

34:48.360 --> 34:50.963
you can make a photocopy;
I'll get it back from you later.

34:51.030 --> 34:53.031
(ringing resumes)

34:53.099 --> 34:56.101
Oh, man...
Hold on a second, will you?

34:58.438 --> 35:01.006
Hey, Allison, I'm with someone.
Can this wait?

35:01.074 --> 35:04.510
No, it can't Lee. I need to talk
to you about a detective.

35:04.577 --> 35:05.844
A man named Carver.

35:05.912 --> 35:07.679
Do you know him?

35:07.747 --> 35:10.282
Of course. He's standing right
here, as a matter of fact.

35:10.350 --> 35:13.652
Yeah, he stopped by, uh,
after his shift. Why?

35:15.688 --> 35:18.323
Oh, my God, Lee.
Say that again out loud.

35:18.391 --> 35:20.559
Say that loud enough so
that he can hear you.

35:20.627 --> 35:22.161
Say that he's standing there
with you.

35:22.228 --> 35:23.795
Please.

35:23.863 --> 35:27.099
I'm standing right here with
Detective Aaron Carver.

35:27.167 --> 35:29.368
Why? What's going on?

35:29.435 --> 35:32.738
I can't explain it right now.
He's involved in all this.

35:32.805 --> 35:36.608
I think he may be the man who's
meant to kill you.

35:36.676 --> 35:38.277
Gee, that's not the
kind of thing

35:38.344 --> 35:40.479
you tell a guy
over the phone.

35:40.547 --> 35:43.949
Uh, hold on a second.

35:44.017 --> 35:48.887
Uh... so it turns out that I'm
gonna have to take this.

35:48.955 --> 35:50.822
Uh, but the good news is, uh...

35:50.890 --> 35:52.824
I will be going in
to work today.

35:52.892 --> 35:54.226
So listen, you have my word,

35:54.294 --> 35:56.528
I'll find that notebook and I'll
make a copy for you

35:56.596 --> 35:59.064
as soon as I get into the
precinct. Sound good?

35:59.132 --> 36:01.934
CARVER:
Yeah.

36:02.001 --> 36:02.935
(door shuts)

36:03.002 --> 36:03.936
Is he gone?

36:04.003 --> 36:05.270
Yeah, he's gone.

36:05.338 --> 36:06.505
Good.

36:06.573 --> 36:08.574
(indistinct conversations)

36:10.910 --> 36:11.910
(conversation stops)

36:11.978 --> 36:13.412
What's going on?

36:13.479 --> 36:15.280
I don't know.
What is going on?

36:15.348 --> 36:17.282
I don't know.
What are you talking about?

36:17.350 --> 36:20.586
Daniel Burroughs is sitting
in our office.

36:20.653 --> 36:24.723
He says he wants
to talk to you.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.259
Oh, geez.

36:28.928 --> 36:30.429
Hello.

36:30.496 --> 36:33.398
I like an engineer who
keeps a clean desk.

36:33.466 --> 36:34.933
Thank you.

36:35.001 --> 36:38.737
An engineer with a messy desk,

36:38.805 --> 36:41.073
it seems like a fundamental
contradiction,

36:41.140 --> 36:45.444
like a priest who doesn't pray,
dentists who don't brush.

36:45.511 --> 36:51.350
Now... let's talk about
engineers who meditate.

36:51.417 --> 36:53.885
Uh, Mr. Burroughs, I
just want you to know

36:53.953 --> 36:56.088
that I would never do
that on company time.

36:56.155 --> 36:59.157
Everyone who does it,
raise their hand.

36:59.225 --> 37:00.425
(mutters)

37:05.598 --> 37:08.867
I didn't pay much attention to
my health when I was your age.

37:08.935 --> 37:11.803
Didn't pay much attention to my
health until a few years ago.

37:11.871 --> 37:13.272
Heart attack.

37:13.339 --> 37:16.275
Doctor told me that
I was stressed,

37:16.342 --> 37:18.677
wanted me to retire.

37:18.745 --> 37:20.145
I probably used that same

37:20.213 --> 37:22.214
"priests who don't pray,
dentists who don't brush"

37:22.282 --> 37:24.449
on him, too, and when he saw
that wasn't getting

37:24.517 --> 37:27.953
any traction...
he mentioned meditation.

37:28.021 --> 37:31.290
So, you meditate?

37:31.357 --> 37:33.158
An hour a day.

37:33.226 --> 37:37.095
That's why I commissioned
that garden you were
sitting in yesterday.

37:37.163 --> 37:39.798
I almost quit before
I ever started.

37:39.866 --> 37:42.567
My wife talked me into sticking
with it, and now...

37:42.635 --> 37:45.737
I honestly think that it may
have saved my life.

37:47.073 --> 37:48.640
I looked at your file.

37:48.708 --> 37:51.376
You've done some pretty
impressive work in solar.

37:51.444 --> 37:54.146
It's a shame that it didn't work
out in the long term.

37:54.213 --> 37:55.714
Thank you.

37:55.782 --> 37:58.383
I'm proud of what
we were able to do.

37:58.451 --> 38:00.385
My wife and I are having

38:00.453 --> 38:02.020
a little dinner party
this weekend,

38:02.088 --> 38:04.556
and I would love it if you
and your wife would come.

38:04.624 --> 38:07.092
I'd love to pick your brain
about that solar cell project.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.762
Maybe we can talk a
bit about what you hope
to accomplish here.

38:12.865 --> 38:15.400
<i>ALLISON:
Are you saying
this all happened 'cause</i>

38:15.468 --> 38:17.369
the guy saw you meditating
during your lunch hour?

38:17.437 --> 38:18.937
JOE:
Yeah, I guess so.
Weird, right?

38:19.005 --> 38:21.707
I mean, anyway, I just thought
I'd give you a heads up in case

38:21.774 --> 38:23.608
you need to drop anything off
at the dry cleaner's.

38:23.676 --> 38:26.078
Duly noted. I'll see you when
you get home. (blows a kiss)

38:26.145 --> 38:27.846
(hangs up)

38:27.914 --> 38:32.517
You know, my son's
not much interested
in office politics.

38:32.585 --> 38:34.186
(scoffs) Thinks it's
all about merit.

38:34.253 --> 38:35.787
That's always
been his weakness.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.690
You knew that he was gonna meet
the founder of the company

38:38.758 --> 38:40.492
if he started meditating,
didn't you?

38:40.560 --> 38:43.795
And his heart?

38:43.863 --> 38:45.497
Boy's heart's just fine.

38:45.565 --> 38:48.834
So, you scared him-- us--
for no reason?

38:48.901 --> 38:53.004
No reason?! I was giving the kid
a leg up on his career.

38:53.072 --> 38:54.840
I mean, the kid
just doesn't get it.

38:54.907 --> 38:56.475
If you want to be the boss,

38:56.542 --> 38:59.144
you've got to do the same thing
the bosses do.

38:59.178 --> 39:01.747
Why do you think I took up golf?

39:01.814 --> 39:03.749
My wife always said
I was a big phony:

39:03.816 --> 39:06.084
"Why do you play a sport you
don't even like?"

39:06.152 --> 39:10.422
But she didn't complain when the
promotions started rolling in.

39:10.490 --> 39:11.890
Neither will you, Ally.

39:11.958 --> 39:12.891
Well...

39:12.959 --> 39:14.926
(phone rings)

39:14.994 --> 39:16.428
Hello?

39:16.496 --> 39:18.930
SCANLON:
Hey, we just spent the better
part of the day

39:18.998 --> 39:20.332
leaning on Detective Carver.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.634
Turns out a cell phone number
registered to him

39:22.702 --> 39:24.503
was found in Randy Littleton's
notebook.

39:24.570 --> 39:27.372
Now, Carver claims that's no
surprise, 'cause he tries to get

39:27.440 --> 39:29.608
his number out to every gang
member in the city.

39:29.675 --> 39:31.576
Apparently, that's how he
recruits informants.

39:31.644 --> 39:34.780
I don't care what he says.
I saw him sit there and watch

39:34.847 --> 39:37.549
while the Littleton brothers
murdered Juan Espinal.

39:37.617 --> 39:39.751
I believe you, Allison,
but right now, there's

39:39.819 --> 39:42.621
no physical evidence that
connects him to any of this.

39:42.688 --> 39:43.855
That makes no sense.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.091
If there wasn't enough evidence
in that notebook

39:46.159 --> 39:49.161
to get him arrested, then why
did he want to kill you for it?

39:49.228 --> 39:50.529
First of all, we don't know

39:50.596 --> 39:53.365
that's what he was doing
at my place.

39:53.433 --> 39:56.668
And second of all, uh...
maybe Carver had no idea

39:56.736 --> 39:58.770
what the Littletons had written
down in there.

39:58.838 --> 40:00.605
Maybe he just couldn't risk
the possibility

40:00.673 --> 40:02.741
that there was something that
implicated him.

40:02.809 --> 40:05.744
The upside is, Internal Affairs
is gonna keep an eye on him.

40:05.812 --> 40:06.778
That's it?

40:06.846 --> 40:08.880
For the moment, yeah.
Look, uh...

40:08.948 --> 40:11.283
I know you're upset.
Hell, so am I.

40:11.350 --> 40:14.286
But, uh...

40:14.353 --> 40:17.489
I also wanted to say thanks.

40:17.557 --> 40:20.225
If it was Carver who was gonna
kill me today,

40:20.293 --> 40:22.127
you pretty much saved my life.

40:22.195 --> 40:23.495
You're welcome.

40:23.563 --> 40:26.198
Hey, hey, do me a favor.
Tomorrow when you wake up

40:26.265 --> 40:28.500
and everything's fine, just send
me a text, okay?

40:28.568 --> 40:31.002
(chuckles)
Done.

40:33.539 --> 40:34.906
(elevator bell dings)

40:36.709 --> 40:39.845
(cell phone rings)

40:44.016 --> 40:44.950
(soft chuckle)

40:45.017 --> 40:46.818
MAN:
Can you hold that?

40:48.821 --> 40:50.222
Thanks.

41:00.333 --> 41:01.333
(bell dings)

41:04.570 --> 41:06.338
Detective Carver?

41:08.307 --> 41:09.708
I'm sorry, have we met?

41:09.775 --> 41:11.476
No, but I know
who you are.

41:11.544 --> 41:13.712
And I know you're
in grave danger.

41:13.779 --> 41:15.614
Danger? I don't think so.

41:15.681 --> 41:17.782
You should think again.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.951
The Littletons
are gone now.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.687
Once word spreads that you
partnered up with them--

41:22.755 --> 41:26.291
the same stickup boys
who terrorized every
drug dealer in Phoenix--

41:26.359 --> 41:27.926
I think some pretty
dangerous people

41:27.994 --> 41:30.428
are gonna come
looking for you.

41:32.164 --> 41:34.633
You know what I would
do if I was you?

41:34.700 --> 41:38.003
I'd turn myself in, let
the police protect me.

41:38.070 --> 41:40.739
It's just a suggestion.

41:40.806 --> 41:44.609
Lady, I don't have any idea what
you're talking about.

41:44.677 --> 41:46.778
But do yourself a favor.

41:46.846 --> 41:49.514
Don't lose any sleep worrying
about me.

41:49.582 --> 41:50.549
(chuckles)

41:50.616 --> 41:53.118
