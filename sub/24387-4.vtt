WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.504
HARRY: What did White tell you?
That I was the breach?

00:05.606 --> 00:06.974
HARRY:
What are they covering up, Said?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.776
OMAR:
Speak to Ardavan, he knows.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.711
-What they're really doing
out here.

00:10.744 --> 00:11.979
What you're really doing.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.182
ARDAVAN:
You know what those are?

00:14.215 --> 00:15.249
These mean nothing.

00:15.283 --> 00:17.385
I can prove exactly
what they mean.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.886
Put that back in your pocket.

00:18.919 --> 00:21.655
Better still, bury it
before it buries you.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.024
It was made very clear
to me that, uh,

00:24.058 --> 00:25.659
if I don't complete this job...

00:25.693 --> 00:27.295
TOUMI:
If you don't kill me,

00:27.328 --> 00:29.763
White takes out your family.

00:29.797 --> 00:32.766
They've burned five operatives
over this.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.902
You think
they're gonna spare you?

00:34.935 --> 00:38.806
You need to know what's going
on, just as much as Harry does.

00:46.013 --> 00:47.848
Turn around.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.118
Slowly.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.528
(drum beating rhythmically,
clapping)

01:04.698 --> 01:06.700
*

01:36.130 --> 01:38.132
*

02:06.894 --> 02:09.730
*

02:38.792 --> 02:40.794
*

02:57.311 --> 02:59.613
* You may find yourself

02:59.647 --> 03:01.849
* In another part of the world

03:01.882 --> 03:05.753
* Living in a beautiful house

03:05.786 --> 03:07.621
* With a beautiful wife

03:10.258 --> 03:12.360
* And you may ask yourself

03:12.393 --> 03:14.728
* "How do I work this?"

03:17.265 --> 03:19.533
* This is not
my beautiful house *

03:21.635 --> 03:24.071
* This is not
my beautiful wife *

03:27.708 --> 03:29.843
* And you may ask yourself

03:32.212 --> 03:34.515
* "Well..."

03:39.019 --> 03:41.455
* "How did I get here?"

03:57.671 --> 04:00.107
*

04:29.337 --> 04:31.372
*

05:00.067 --> 05:02.503
Turn around slowly.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.214
What the fuck
are you doing here?

05:19.119 --> 05:20.788
No, Harry, wait!

05:38.305 --> 05:40.474
No, no!

05:40.508 --> 05:42.843
Move! Go!

06:07.134 --> 06:09.737
Where are the girls?

06:12.005 --> 06:13.841
The girls.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.577
Lola, Chloe. Ah!

06:16.610 --> 06:18.311
-Maman.
-Maman.

06:18.345 --> 06:20.648
Now, you're gonna be here
for a while.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.684
There's toys for the kids.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.619
Uh, the kitchen is downstairs.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.054
Larder's full.

06:27.087 --> 06:28.856
I don't understand.
What is going on?

06:28.889 --> 06:31.659
Now, you kids, you're free
to roam the grounds.

06:31.692 --> 06:33.861
There's a trampoline
and a rope swing.

06:38.499 --> 06:39.733
ANNA:
No.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.302
Wait.

06:42.335 --> 06:44.337
Please.

06:45.439 --> 06:48.308
What is really going on here?

06:50.644 --> 06:53.714
Are we being used as leverage?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.784
I'm having some hot water
sent up for you.

06:56.817 --> 07:01.388
What if my husband refuses to do
what you want him to?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.372
Max, it's me.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.574
I lost you.

07:20.608 --> 07:21.675
I'm back in the room.

07:21.709 --> 07:24.344
Call me.

07:58.078 --> 08:00.013
It's good to see you.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.887
Okay, so what are you
doing here?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.455
MAX:
Rescuing you, apparently.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.490
I don't need your help.

08:10.524 --> 08:11.825
A thank you would be nice.

08:11.859 --> 08:13.460
Fuck you.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.829
Right.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.031
Okay.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.568
Well, now we've got that
out of the way.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.102
I came here to find you.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.637
TOUMI:
And to put a bullet in my head.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.639
Don't forget that little detail.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.408
There is that.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.877
TOUMI:
White told him you were dead.

08:29.910 --> 08:32.512
Said we'd gone AWOL,

08:32.546 --> 08:34.848
sent your father here
to clean up the mess.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.684
He got to Cooper; I was next.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.620
Yeah, well, you always were
nothing if not efficient.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.822
I still don't understand

08:41.855 --> 08:44.191
why you came, because I know
it's not for me.

08:49.730 --> 08:51.932
White threatened his kids.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.837
So you've got kids?

08:56.870 --> 08:59.439
-Yeah, two girls.
-Oh, wow.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.609
You have been busy.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.243
You still with the mum?

09:05.112 --> 09:08.015
Yeah.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.483
We need to move from here,
find somewhere less conspicuous.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.019
Since when is there a "we"?

09:12.052 --> 09:13.286
Can you even remember
the last time

09:13.320 --> 09:14.788
we were in
the same room together?

09:14.822 --> 09:17.591
Okay, family reunion over.
What now?

09:17.625 --> 09:18.659
We're in the same boat here.

09:18.692 --> 09:20.694
For now.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.663
White's targeting my kids.

09:22.696 --> 09:24.197
He wants you dead.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.033
The only way out of this
is to find out

09:26.066 --> 09:27.234
what it is they're covering up

09:27.267 --> 09:29.036
and use it to buy
our lives back.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.638
Yeah, what do you think
I've been trying to do?

09:37.210 --> 09:40.580
Kahani walked Ardavan
into an ambush.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.883
Clearly, he's no lawyer.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.584
Maybe he's agency?

09:44.618 --> 09:46.687
I've trawled the database,
I can't find anything.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.857
Ardavan had something on them.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.225
TOUMI:
We heard him talking to Kahani.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.027
MAX:
If we can find out what that is,

09:54.061 --> 09:56.029
maybe we can use it as leverage.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.798
And how do we do that?

09:57.831 --> 09:59.800
What, so now
you do want my help?

10:26.660 --> 10:28.095
Welcome back.
How was London?

10:28.128 --> 10:30.397
Old. And isolated.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.299
Hey, what's going on
in Southern Lebanon?

10:32.332 --> 10:34.601
My phone's been lighting up, but
I can't get anything concrete.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.369
Some sort of explosion.
Looks like military.

10:36.403 --> 10:38.205
-First activity in a while.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.873
Local wedding.
We don't yet have a number.

10:39.907 --> 10:43.276
JONES: It's too far north
for an Israeli incursion.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.645
Hezbollah don't target
their own people.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.114
Anyone taking responsibility?

10:47.147 --> 10:48.481
That's the thing. No one.

10:48.515 --> 10:51.218
The usual chatter,
it's all silent.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.956
And I'm not your first
port of call?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.025
What the fuck's going on?

10:58.058 --> 11:00.293
Was that us?

11:00.327 --> 11:03.196
Was... that us?

11:10.137 --> 11:11.805
I don't know.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.606
I'm getting a lot of heat
on this.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.542
Find out, and fast.

11:20.413 --> 11:24.051
-JONES: Get the fuck out.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.563
It's me.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.265
We need to talk.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.384
Was this you?

11:57.417 --> 11:58.618
Answer me.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.988
It was an accident.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.622
Oh, you have got
to be fucking kidding me.

12:02.655 --> 12:04.257
-The drone drifted off target.

12:04.291 --> 12:06.659
Do you have any idea how
difficult you have made my job?

12:06.693 --> 12:08.561
It wasn't supposed
to happen this way.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.030
Everything goes through me.
That is the deal.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.464
That is the only way this works.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.233
It won't happen again.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.635
You're fucking right
it won't happen again.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.204
We apologize.

12:17.237 --> 12:21.008
That apology better have
a lot of zeros attached.

12:22.409 --> 12:25.112
We need you
to take the fall on this one.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.282
You are un-fucking-believable.

12:29.316 --> 12:30.884
I get it.

12:30.918 --> 12:32.652
You're pissed.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.256
But watch your tone.

12:36.289 --> 12:40.293
Ali Ardavan had intel
he can use against us.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.030
Find it.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.310
White's waiting
for a photo of my corpse.

12:57.344 --> 12:59.146
What are you gonna tell him?

13:08.989 --> 13:12.059
MAX: I've tracked Said to
the Hotel Excelsior in Sodeco.

13:12.092 --> 13:14.227
It seems he's been praying
at the Al-Amin Mosque.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.596
I'm gonna use Leyla
to lure him to a meet.

13:16.629 --> 13:19.132
-She is,
with a little persuasion.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.736
See for yourself.

13:34.982 --> 13:37.184
The clock's ticking, Max.
Find Said.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.651
Anna's not answering
any of my calls.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.587
And that concerns me how?

13:40.620 --> 13:42.689
I know you, George.
Have you got someone on her?

13:44.291 --> 13:47.127
I need to know
my family is safe.

13:49.796 --> 13:52.265
I need her to call me.

13:54.868 --> 13:57.404
All right.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.638
I'll see what I can do.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.440
You do that.

14:00.473 --> 14:03.110
By the way, Ali Ardavan's dead.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.978
I picked it up
from local chatter.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.547
And before you ask,
it was nothing to do with me.

14:10.817 --> 14:14.187
Would have been less risky
to put a bullet in my head.

14:14.221 --> 14:16.456
Oh, yeah?

14:16.489 --> 14:18.892
Give my son one more reason
to hate me?

14:27.935 --> 14:29.836
Think he bought it?

14:29.869 --> 14:32.372
Gonna find out.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.641
Why tell him about Ardavan?

14:34.674 --> 14:36.076
He was on your list.

14:36.109 --> 14:38.011
-Someone else got to him,

14:38.045 --> 14:41.448
which means White isn't
as in control as he thinks.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.416
Did Said come to Beirut?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.884
MAX:
I doubt it. I'd be long gone.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.819
Yeah, I'm sure you would be.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.656
Right.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.260
The man saved my life.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.664
And when I see him, I'll be sure
to tell him how grateful I am.

14:59.199 --> 15:01.068
Do you know where Ardavan
was staying in Beirut?

15:01.101 --> 15:02.769
Les Palmiers apartments.

15:02.802 --> 15:05.672
Okay, let's start there.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.941
See if we can find out
what he had on Kahani.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.906
*

15:53.820 --> 15:55.222
This is useless.

15:55.255 --> 15:57.057
We don't know
what we're looking for.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.193
Anyone got
any better suggestions?

16:06.899 --> 16:10.203
NAPIER:
I've got White on the line.

16:10.237 --> 16:12.872
Put him through.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.574
George, how can I help you?

16:14.607 --> 16:17.177
WHITE: Ali Ardavan was
my responsibility.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.679
I received intelligence
that he was in Beirut,

16:19.712 --> 16:21.348
and I took
the appropriate action.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.949
Without informing me?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.152
Last time I checked,
I didn't have to.

16:25.185 --> 16:27.387
What happened to us
working together on this, hmm?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.089
Ali Ardavan slipped through

16:29.122 --> 16:31.624
your fingers once. I wasn't
about to take that risk again.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.294
He is gonna fuck us
from beyond the grave.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.729
Taken care of.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.303
He made contact
with Habib Mansouri,

16:43.336 --> 16:45.572
a political journalist
from An-Nahar.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.208
Ardavan kept an insurance
policy that would be passed on

16:48.241 --> 16:51.211
to this journalist
in the event of his death.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.979
My people are on it.

16:53.012 --> 16:55.515
They're on their way
to his apartment as we speak.

17:16.103 --> 17:19.038
TOUMI:
There's someone approaching
Ardavan's apartment.

17:46.433 --> 17:49.001
He's taken something
out of the cupboard.

17:49.035 --> 17:51.104
Red notebook,

17:51.138 --> 17:52.839
left jacket pocket.

17:52.872 --> 17:56.276
Shit!
There's someone else in there!

17:58.711 --> 18:01.013
-Man down. He's been hit.

18:07.320 --> 18:09.322
He has the book.
He's taken the book.

18:54.301 --> 18:57.103
*

18:59.138 --> 19:01.107
(indistinct chatter
and laughter)

19:58.030 --> 20:00.633
You're lucky.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.302
They play together well.

20:02.335 --> 20:05.004
Have they always been so close?

20:05.037 --> 20:07.407
They've gotten closer
since you pulled a gun on them.

20:11.711 --> 20:14.447
When are you going to tell me
what's really going on?

20:14.481 --> 20:17.049
Just be patient.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.689
Max will come through for you.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.657
He loves you.

20:24.691 --> 20:26.859
He's a father.

20:29.629 --> 20:32.031
I'm not a monster, Anna.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.870
Anything else?

20:39.105 --> 20:41.474
I need you to call him.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.257
Yes?

21:01.193 --> 21:03.229
What?

21:03.262 --> 21:04.664
The drone strike in Lebanon.

21:04.697 --> 21:06.799
-It was us.

21:08.701 --> 21:11.070
It was an accident.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.872
Wrong coordinates were entered.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.541
Human error.

21:19.412 --> 21:22.048
Jesus fucking Christ.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.053
You're the face on this one.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.489
Not me.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.275
BURRELL:
You take full responsibility?

21:49.308 --> 21:51.177
JONES:
I do, sir. Personally.

21:51.210 --> 21:52.545
BURRELL:
Personally?

21:52.579 --> 21:55.582
JONES:
It happened on my watch.

21:57.884 --> 22:00.587
The drone was almost
150 miles off target.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.089
It was a coding error.

22:03.122 --> 22:04.691
An error? Which led

22:04.724 --> 22:07.394
to the loss of civilian lives

22:07.427 --> 22:10.029
in a region

22:10.062 --> 22:11.864
where there's already
considerable tension.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.866
If I may?

22:13.900 --> 22:16.469
Ms. Jones,

22:16.503 --> 22:18.505
remind us,

22:18.538 --> 22:20.773
what were you actually
trying to hit?

22:20.807 --> 22:24.176
Rashid Kalfa,
number two in al-Qaeda in Syria.

22:24.210 --> 22:26.813
We had firm intel
that he was in Qatana.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.284
Assassination by drone strike is
a factor in the war on terror.

22:32.318 --> 22:34.421
It's the way we do business.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.688
Overseen by this directorate.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.956
BURRELL:
We didn't oversee this bullshit.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.458
HAWES:
How many terrorists have you

22:38.491 --> 22:40.192
actually killed
in this endeavor?

22:40.226 --> 22:42.395
-I don't have exact...
-Terrorists that have

22:42.429 --> 22:44.296
actively plotted
against this country?

22:44.330 --> 22:46.766
We've made hundreds
of successful strikes.

22:46.799 --> 22:49.168
And this...

22:49.201 --> 22:52.271
is one of the rare occasions
where the system failed?

22:52.304 --> 22:53.506
Yes.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.609
Does the senator have
a point to make?

22:56.643 --> 22:59.145
Prague, 1945.

22:59.178 --> 23:02.649
Allied command were given
the order to bomb Dresden.

23:02.682 --> 23:05.017
One U.S. squadron
drifted off course

23:05.051 --> 23:08.087
and destroyed parts
of the Czech capital.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.423
What's the relevance
of the history lesson?

23:10.457 --> 23:13.359
The mistake diminished
in significance

23:13.392 --> 23:15.795
due to the greatness
of the prize!

23:15.828 --> 23:18.665
In the chaos of war,

23:18.698 --> 23:21.200
civilians die.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.288
It's numbers.

23:42.321 --> 23:43.856
This is what they killed
Ardavan for?

23:43.890 --> 23:46.358
I never thanked you...
for pulling me out that car.

23:46.392 --> 23:48.060
Oh, you mean
for saving your life?

23:48.094 --> 23:50.463
-Yeah.
-No.

23:50.497 --> 23:53.199
You didn't thank me.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.101
And for coming to find me
in Beirut.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.269
Who said I came to find you?

23:57.303 --> 23:59.706
Don't overplay your hand,
Clarke.

24:05.211 --> 24:06.779
You okay?

24:06.813 --> 24:08.414
Yeah.

24:18.858 --> 24:22.228
It's been a long time since
I walked in on you with a girl.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.164
TOUMI:
Looks like

24:25.197 --> 24:27.834
-some sort of financial record.
-There is a name there.

24:27.867 --> 24:29.836
-Najmat Fiddia.
-That's a private gambling club.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.639
Or it was when I was last here.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.006
It used to move around
every month

24:34.040 --> 24:35.575
to stay ahead
of the authorities.

24:35.608 --> 24:38.611
That could be
a gambler's record.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.079
Professional gamblers

24:40.112 --> 24:42.281
like to keep a-a diary.
Can I have a look?

24:43.282 --> 24:44.784
And that's why they killed him?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.753
-I don't know.
-So, we're going up

24:46.786 --> 24:48.454
against White
with Ardavan's record

24:48.487 --> 24:50.657
-at blackjack.
You got a better idea?

24:50.690 --> 24:52.191
-Don't fucking patronize me.
-I'm not patronizing you.

24:52.224 --> 24:53.760
If you got a better idea,
I want to hear it.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.427
Do you think that I can't work
this out on my own?

24:55.461 --> 24:56.663
Do you think I need you?

24:56.696 --> 24:58.297
You know,
you always were too proud.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.699
You're talking like you know me.

24:59.732 --> 25:01.267
You don't know
the first thing about me.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.902
All you know

25:02.935 --> 25:04.971
is a locked bedroom door
and silence at the dinner table.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.239
So, why don't you come and find
me when you've calmed down, eh?

25:07.273 --> 25:08.808
Look, he's gonna fuck off now.

25:10.843 --> 25:14.847
You don't know the first thing
about me, either, pal.

25:16.382 --> 25:17.784
Get out of my fucking way.

25:17.817 --> 25:19.619
Oh, right.

25:19.652 --> 25:21.253
-You think I haven't

25:21.287 --> 25:22.488
thought about it since I was 15?

25:22.521 --> 25:24.056
-Harry, calm down.
-Go on, hit me.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.457
Get it out of the way.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.095
Go on. Hit me.

25:45.077 --> 25:47.814
ANNA:
Max? It's me.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.882
Anna, are you okay?

25:51.884 --> 25:54.420
I'm fine.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.188
I'm sorry I haven't called yet.

26:00.526 --> 26:02.328
It's been a little...

26:04.330 --> 26:06.498
Chloe passed her violin.

26:06.532 --> 26:08.300
That's great.

26:08.334 --> 26:11.103
That's great. Tell her, uh...

26:11.137 --> 26:13.039
congratulations.

26:13.072 --> 26:15.675
Tell her I'm proud of her.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.010
How's Lola?

26:18.044 --> 26:19.411
She's fine.

26:19.445 --> 26:22.014
She misses you.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.285
I miss her, too.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.021
Tell her that, will you?

26:29.055 --> 26:31.490
I will.

26:31.523 --> 26:34.026
I'll tell her.

26:35.027 --> 26:37.964
When are you coming home?

26:37.997 --> 26:39.966
Soon.

26:39.999 --> 26:42.234
It's almost over.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.439
Come home, Max.

26:49.508 --> 26:50.877
Please come home.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.582
I will.

26:57.650 --> 26:59.218
I love you.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.323
I love you back.

27:13.900 --> 27:15.935
You did well.

27:17.937 --> 27:19.939
Fuck you.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.447
Is she okay?

27:28.480 --> 27:29.648
Her?

27:29.682 --> 27:31.050
Oh, she's fine.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.252
And the girls?

27:33.285 --> 27:35.287
They're fine, too.
Thanks for asking.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.092
Right.
Let's go and find this...

27:40.126 --> 27:42.361
Najmat Fiddia.

27:42.394 --> 27:43.830
See if we can find out

27:43.863 --> 27:46.665
why the little red book's
worth killing for.

28:15.294 --> 28:16.562
WHITE:
What's the latest?

28:16.595 --> 28:18.230
I got a position
on the brother's phone.

28:18.264 --> 28:21.233
He picked up a burner
in Saint-Michel.

28:21.267 --> 28:22.802
We're on our way to pick him up.

28:22.835 --> 28:25.271
Alive would be preferable.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.006
LAURENCE:
He's around here.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.315
Najmat Fiddia?

29:46.318 --> 29:48.320
*

30:01.000 --> 30:02.668
Alayhi as-salaam.

30:02.701 --> 30:03.702
Salaam alaikum.

30:03.735 --> 30:05.804
You're looking for a table?

30:05.838 --> 30:08.074
You're not an easy place
to find.

30:08.107 --> 30:10.943
Our players value their privacy.

30:10.977 --> 30:11.978
Players like Ali Ardavan.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.847
I don't know that name.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.748
-I'm sorry.
-We have information

30:16.782 --> 30:17.783
that says otherwise.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.018
Look, you don't want us
to make life

30:19.051 --> 30:20.819
more difficult for you.

30:26.592 --> 30:29.695
This is Ali Ardavan's journal.

30:30.696 --> 30:32.464
Would you take a look?

30:32.498 --> 30:34.266
Then we'll go.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.302
*

30:40.506 --> 30:42.474
Gamblers keep record
of their games.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.743
-Obsessed with numbers.
-Uh-huh.

30:44.776 --> 30:47.179
His game was roulette, he was

30:47.213 --> 30:49.548
trying to beat the odds.

30:49.581 --> 30:52.484
A foolish hope but a compulsion.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.620
HARRY:
Then look again.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.723
Something about it's
significant.

31:00.792 --> 31:03.662
I don't know.
Maybe he was drunk or...

31:05.064 --> 31:06.832
Or what?

31:06.865 --> 31:08.767
This page here is meaningless.

31:08.800 --> 31:12.304
The numbers in roulette
only go to 36.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.661
Can I have a word?

31:41.700 --> 31:43.002
How are the girls doing?

31:48.040 --> 31:51.610
I hope your husband knows
just how strong you are.

31:53.579 --> 31:54.846
I have two boys.

31:54.880 --> 31:57.016
Arlo and Hayden.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.584
Hayden is the youngest one.

31:58.617 --> 32:00.752
Headstrong like...

32:00.786 --> 32:03.990
-like his mother, just like...

32:04.023 --> 32:07.359
How can you be two people?

32:07.393 --> 32:11.297
A loving father and... this man?

32:11.330 --> 32:14.566
You're not asking about me.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.269
You're asking
about your husband.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.772
What sort of relationship
can two people have

32:20.806 --> 32:22.441
if they never speak...

32:22.474 --> 32:25.077
if they never speak the truth?

32:26.512 --> 32:28.480
The truth?

32:28.514 --> 32:31.150
I'm protecting my boys.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.519
Maybe Max was protecting you.

32:37.523 --> 32:40.026
We found your brother's phone.

32:40.059 --> 32:43.162
Three miles up
toward Saint-Michael.

32:43.195 --> 32:45.064
He was writing
a text message for you.

32:45.097 --> 32:47.566
Only got as far
as three words...

32:47.599 --> 32:49.801
"le château fort."

32:51.803 --> 32:53.439
Does it mean anything to you?

32:53.472 --> 32:56.475
-No.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.149
We will find him.

33:03.182 --> 33:06.152
You know that.

33:06.185 --> 33:09.388
It's better for you
if you help us.

33:09.421 --> 33:12.991
I don't know
what he's talking about.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.027
Honestly.

33:48.060 --> 33:51.163
Good afternoon.

33:51.197 --> 33:53.365
At 0500 yesterday,

33:53.399 --> 33:55.033
Eastern Standard Time,

33:55.067 --> 33:57.002
there was an explosion
in the village of Aaqbiye,

33:57.035 --> 33:59.671
Southern Lebanon.

33:59.705 --> 34:02.508
22 men, women and children
were killed,

34:02.541 --> 34:05.277
all Lebanese nationals.

34:06.278 --> 34:08.780
The explosion was the result

34:08.814 --> 34:10.682
of computer error.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.952
A U.S. military drone drifted

34:13.985 --> 34:15.087
tragically off course.

34:15.121 --> 34:17.022
I must stress

34:17.055 --> 34:20.092
that the accident was caused
by machine failure,

34:20.126 --> 34:23.061
not human miscalculation.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.632
The U.S. government

34:26.665 --> 34:30.102
bitterly regrets this tragedy

34:30.136 --> 34:33.872
and is in consultation
with Lebanese authorities.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.475
Thank you.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.211
Shh.

35:40.906 --> 35:42.841
I'll take that up to her.

35:42.874 --> 35:45.444
Thank you.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.879
*

36:11.102 --> 36:13.505
*

36:55.914 --> 36:58.284
Daniel!

36:58.317 --> 37:00.085
Come on!

37:00.118 --> 37:01.387
Get the dogs!

37:26.845 --> 37:30.382
CHLOE:
Maman, ils arrivent!

37:46.632 --> 37:49.000
:
Non.

37:49.034 --> 37:51.970
Non!

37:52.003 --> 37:55.707
Non, non! Non. Non.

39:11.082 --> 39:14.085
Rache?

39:15.120 --> 39:17.823
You've decorated.

39:17.856 --> 39:21.560
But then been a while
since I came round.

39:21.593 --> 39:23.995
*

39:29.034 --> 39:32.604
You've come all this way
just to see me?

39:32.638 --> 39:35.340
-I'm very flattered.
-Where else
did you expect me to go?

39:35.373 --> 39:37.943
Nowhere to run

39:37.976 --> 39:39.678
Isn't that a song?

39:40.812 --> 39:42.781
Security's three minutes away.

39:42.814 --> 39:44.349
-Presumably, you know that.
-Your heart

39:44.382 --> 39:45.951
would have stopped pumping blood
to your brain

39:45.984 --> 39:47.486
before they even made it
to the front door.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.423
Well, at least
you've done your maths.

39:52.458 --> 39:54.325
Sit.

40:23.589 --> 40:28.159
You know your Shakespeare,
do you, George?

40:28.193 --> 40:30.462
You know Macbeth?

40:30.496 --> 40:32.698
When he kills the children.

40:32.731 --> 40:36.301
Do you recall what the other
bloke swears to do to him?

40:36.334 --> 40:41.072
I don't get to the theater
as much as I'd like, so...

40:42.774 --> 40:46.077
What if it was your child that
had the kill order put on them?

40:46.111 --> 40:47.479
Oh.

40:47.513 --> 40:49.481
You really do want
your pound of flesh.

40:49.515 --> 40:51.883
They're not just names.

40:51.917 --> 40:54.385
They're all someone's daughter,

40:54.419 --> 40:56.021
someone's son.

40:56.054 --> 40:59.024
Have you lost your nerve, Alex?

40:59.057 --> 41:01.426
I've seen it before,

41:01.459 --> 41:03.495
in stronger men than you.

41:03.529 --> 41:06.598
Why the order on Harry Clarke?

41:09.535 --> 41:11.503
You didn't go through with it.

41:13.438 --> 41:16.274
That's why you're on the run.

41:22.213 --> 41:25.283
7-1-3-9-5-0-

41:25.316 --> 41:26.985
4-0-9.

41:37.095 --> 41:38.797
Nothing.

41:42.467 --> 41:46.071
They put Ardavan in his coffin
for these numbers, okay?

41:46.104 --> 41:47.673
If they're so significant,
why write them

41:47.706 --> 41:49.407
in a gambling journal?

41:49.440 --> 41:51.910
Best place to hide a tree
is in a forest.

41:53.912 --> 41:56.514
Keep looking, keep trying.

41:59.084 --> 42:01.587
SAID: Why did you make me
take him to Tehran?

42:01.620 --> 42:03.889
Harry?

42:03.922 --> 42:06.424
Did you know
what was gonna happen?

42:07.458 --> 42:09.427
How could I?

42:09.460 --> 42:11.429
I didn't know
he was playing both sides.

42:11.462 --> 42:13.665
You really believe that?

42:13.699 --> 42:16.802
I believe it
because it's the truth.

42:18.536 --> 42:20.606
What are you covering up,
George?

42:20.639 --> 42:23.575
Alex, you're tired.

42:23.609 --> 42:25.977
-You should get some sleep.
-I made him swear the oath.

42:26.011 --> 42:27.378
I trained him up.

42:27.412 --> 42:29.380
I'm not just his friend,
his boss.

42:29.414 --> 42:31.683
I'm practically his father.

42:31.717 --> 42:35.253
What did you think
I was going to do?

42:35.286 --> 42:36.888
Whatever your country asks
of you.

42:36.922 --> 42:38.456
Isn't that the point?

42:38.489 --> 42:40.692
But it's not, is it?

42:40.726 --> 42:43.695
It's not for country.

42:43.729 --> 42:45.631
Not anymore.

42:45.664 --> 42:48.800
Then what is it for?

43:00.979 --> 43:03.081
SAID:
Oh.

43:03.114 --> 43:06.117
I didn't come for retribution.

43:09.120 --> 43:12.691
I just came to tell you...

43:12.724 --> 43:16.227
you carry on living
in this world that you've built.

43:18.664 --> 43:21.132
But I don't care to.

43:46.424 --> 43:48.593
TOUMI:
Still nothing.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.528
What if they're coordinates?

43:58.503 --> 44:02.107
It's coordinates for Aaqbiye,
Southern Lebanon.

44:10.448 --> 44:12.417
Wait a minute, go back.

44:15.887 --> 44:17.956
There.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.557
Play it.

44:19.590 --> 44:23.094
At 0500 yesterday,
Eastern Standard Time,

44:23.128 --> 44:25.230
there was an explosion
in the village

44:25.263 --> 44:27.365
of Aaqbiye, Southern Lebanon.

44:27.398 --> 44:29.768
22 men, women and children

44:29.801 --> 44:32.570
were killed,
all Lebanese nationals.

44:32.603 --> 44:34.605
NEWSMAN:
The bodies of the victims

44:34.639 --> 44:37.042
lie at the site
where the drone struck.

44:37.075 --> 44:40.946
Men and women, whole families
with children at their side.

44:40.979 --> 44:42.814
Limbs are missing,

44:42.848 --> 44:45.717
faces are contorted
by shrapnel and pain.

44:51.857 --> 44:55.693
MAX: They're coordinates
of the drone attack.

44:55.727 --> 44:59.197
Ardavan knew the coordinates
of the site before it happened.

44:59.230 --> 45:01.599
That's what he had on them.

45:01.632 --> 45:03.168
He was using it against them.

45:03.201 --> 45:04.870
JONES:
...that the accident was caused

45:04.903 --> 45:06.838
by machine failure

45:06.872 --> 45:08.807
not human miscalculation.

45:14.245 --> 45:16.214
This was no fucking accident.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.949
JONES
The U.S. government

45:17.983 --> 45:20.819
bitterly regrets this tragedy

45:20.852 --> 45:24.555
and is in consultation
with Lebanese authorities.

45:24.589 --> 45:26.357
Thank you.

45:30.495 --> 45:33.664
I'm sorry, Alex.
I'm very sorry.

45:35.466 --> 45:37.435
But I'm not an automaton.

45:37.468 --> 45:39.670
Can we just please...

45:39.704 --> 45:42.240
Can we just wind the clock back?

45:42.273 --> 45:43.809
I disobeyed a kill order.

45:43.842 --> 45:45.176
I know what happens.

45:45.210 --> 45:46.644
I'm section chief, Alex.

45:46.677 --> 45:48.847
But more than that,
I'm your friend.

45:48.880 --> 45:52.083
:
I write the rules.

45:53.618 --> 45:56.254
Stay for a drink.

45:56.287 --> 45:58.289
I'll open a bottle,

45:58.323 --> 46:01.326
and we can rewrite
the damn things together.

46:06.898 --> 46:09.500
I've got something
I think you'll like.

46:26.717 --> 46:30.288
WHITE: We need to talk
about what happened in Tehran.

46:31.689 --> 46:34.759
Does Max know
Harry's still alive?

46:34.792 --> 46:37.562
Max? Why would Max

46:37.595 --> 46:39.197
think that Harry is...

47:32.317 --> 47:34.719
You let me leave.

47:36.721 --> 47:38.957
You followed me.

47:38.990 --> 47:41.492
Get the girls.

47:44.062 --> 47:45.496
LAURENCE:
Come on!

47:47.132 --> 47:49.700
-Maman!
-Maman!

47:58.643 --> 48:00.611
WHITE: You've gone
a little quiet on me.

48:00.645 --> 48:02.380
George.

48:02.413 --> 48:03.648
I've been busy.

48:03.681 --> 48:05.350
Care to share?

48:05.383 --> 48:07.953
Seems the tip about
the Al-Amin Mosque paid off.

48:07.986 --> 48:10.655
-Said's been praying there.

48:10.688 --> 48:12.557
I need you to be sure.

48:12.590 --> 48:15.826
Time is running out for those
little girls of yours, Max.

48:17.828 --> 48:20.631
He's in a cafe
across the street.

48:21.866 --> 48:23.935
I'm looking at him right now.

48:25.203 --> 48:26.972
Good.

48:27.005 --> 48:29.540
Then let's take the appropriate
action, then, shall we?

48:29.574 --> 48:30.942
Sure.

48:30.976 --> 48:32.978
