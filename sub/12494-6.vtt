WEBVTT

00:03.125 --> 00:06.250
Okay, who's ready to have some fun?

00:08.208 --> 00:10.500
I guess you didn't hear me.
What I said was,

00:10.583 --> 00:13.041
"Who's ready to have some fun?"

00:14.583 --> 00:17.375
Mom, no offense, but whenever you
say something's gonna be fun,

00:17.458 --> 00:19.250
it's not!

00:21.125 --> 00:22.375
Until now,

00:22.750 --> 00:26.250
because it is time for the first and last

00:26.333 --> 00:29.375
Duncan family baby naming contest!

00:31.333 --> 00:32.583
And the streak continues.

00:34.417 --> 00:36.667
Okay, you guys,
the prize is the satisfaction

00:36.750 --> 00:39.125
of having named
your baby brother or sister.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.125
And five bucks.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.834
Okay, come on, you guys.
Who wants to get the ball rolling?

00:46.375 --> 00:47.458
Uh, I'll go.

00:47.542 --> 00:49.625
If it's a girl, "Erika."

00:50.458 --> 00:52.500
If it's a boy, "Noah."

00:52.583 --> 00:55.500
Amy: "Erika" and "Noah."

00:55.583 --> 00:57.709
Those are very interesting.
Where'd you get those?

00:57.792 --> 00:59.166
First things that popped into my head.

01:00.667 --> 01:01.542
I'll go.

01:01.625 --> 01:04.333
If it's a girl, Sydney.
If it's a boy, Jonah.

01:04.417 --> 01:05.417
Okay.

01:05.500 --> 01:08.291
Now, I actually put some
thought into these names.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.792
I chose "Jonah"
after the character in the classic...

01:10.875 --> 01:12.041
Okay, who's next?

01:13.792 --> 01:16.625
I'll go. If it's a boy, "Toby."

01:17.500 --> 01:18.583
If it's a girl...

01:19.125 --> 01:20.125
I don't care.

01:21.250 --> 01:23.417
Okay, um, "Toby."

01:25.041 --> 01:26.959
And I'll just fill in...

01:28.250 --> 01:29.250
"Jenny."

01:31.875 --> 01:33.083
How about you, Charlie?

01:33.959 --> 01:35.166
You wanna pick some names?

01:35.250 --> 01:36.500
Candy.

01:37.959 --> 01:40.250
Oh, that's cute. And for a boy?

01:40.667 --> 01:41.750
Hotdog.

01:44.250 --> 01:45.166
Hotdog.

01:46.458 --> 01:50.375

Teddy, you okay?

02:52.583 --> 02:54.208
I don't have time for all these questions.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.333
I have a huge European history
final tomorrow.

02:56.417 --> 02:58.125
Okay, take it easy.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.041
Easy?

03:00.166 --> 03:01.542
It's worth half of my grade.

03:01.625 --> 03:03.834
Plus it's second semester, junior year,

03:03.917 --> 03:05.667
so these are the most important
grades for college.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.500
If I don't get into a good college,
I won't have a good career.

03:09.208 --> 03:11.792
Or a nice family, or a happy life!

03:13.917 --> 03:15.667
Everything's on the line here, people.

03:17.750 --> 03:18.583
Wow.

03:19.000 --> 03:21.041
I hope Hotdog
doesn't get this stressed out.

03:23.125 --> 03:24.083
Hey, dad. Hey, mom.

03:24.166 --> 03:27.667
Hey, there are the soon-to-be
High School graduates.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.291
And they said it couldn't be done.

03:31.375 --> 03:32.917
Come on, Emmett, who said that?

03:33.000 --> 03:34.625
Uh, my dad, my mom.

03:35.375 --> 03:36.792
Most of my teachers.

03:37.875 --> 03:39.250
I think you did, Mr. Duncan.

03:40.917 --> 03:42.667
Well, they were all wrong.

03:43.458 --> 03:45.250
I can't believe my baby's gonna graduate.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.500
I can't believe her baby's
not gonna graduate.

03:51.709 --> 03:52.959
Wait, wait, wait. What do you mean?

03:53.041 --> 03:55.333
Dude, I just found out
I got an incomplete in PE.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.041
That means I'm not gonna get my diploma.

03:59.125 --> 04:02.583
Wait, I'm graduating and you're not?

04:02.667 --> 04:04.792
This is like the exact opposite
of kindergarten.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.375
My parents are gonna be crushed, man.
This is a disaster.

04:09.458 --> 04:11.166
Dude, you can't give up.

04:11.542 --> 04:12.583
Just talk to your teacher.

04:12.667 --> 04:14.041
Work something out. Who is it?

04:14.125 --> 04:15.333
Mr. Hammerstone.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.417
Madman Hammerstone?

04:17.250 --> 04:18.834
No, Fluffy Bunny Hammerstone.

04:20.333 --> 04:21.417
Oh, then you should be fine.

04:27.250 --> 04:29.166
Okay, Charlie, honey.

04:29.250 --> 04:32.542
We have something very,
very important to talk to you about.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.625
Now you know we have
a new baby on the way, right?

04:35.709 --> 04:36.750
Where is it?

04:36.834 --> 04:38.208
It's in mommy's tummy.

04:38.875 --> 04:40.709
Did you eat it?

04:40.792 --> 04:41.750
No.

04:42.458 --> 04:43.458
Did daddy?

04:45.291 --> 04:47.417
Hey, Gabe's here.

04:48.291 --> 04:49.458
You wanna not be here?

04:52.667 --> 04:56.041
Okay, Charlie, now,
when the new baby comes home,

04:56.125 --> 04:59.041
mommy and daddy, we're gonna have
to spend a lot of time with him or her.

04:59.125 --> 05:02.166
But that doesn't mean
that we love you any less.

05:02.250 --> 05:05.792
That's right.
We love all of our babies the same.

05:05.875 --> 05:08.083
And every one of you has been a baby.

05:08.625 --> 05:11.500
Amy: PJ was a baby. Teddy was a baby.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.000
Gabe was a baby.

05:14.834 --> 05:16.041
So let me get this straight.

05:16.917 --> 05:20.250
When dad plays peek-a-boo with me,
he doesn't actually disappear?

05:20.333 --> 05:22.250
No, he's just behind his hands.

05:22.333 --> 05:23.542
Are you sure?

05:23.625 --> 05:26.625
Do we have to have
this conversation every day?

05:26.750 --> 05:29.208
- I'm hungry.
- Me, too.

05:29.792 --> 05:30.875
I could eat.

05:30.959 --> 05:32.792
- Shall we?
- On three.

05:33.709 --> 05:36.125
Wait, does anyone know
how to count to three?

05:38.375 --> 05:39.208
Three.

05:48.083 --> 05:51.250
Oh, what can possibly be going through
that little head of hers?

05:51.375 --> 05:53.250
I have no idea.

06:04.875 --> 06:06.542
Hi, Ivy.

06:06.625 --> 06:09.834
Uh, no, actually, I can't talk right now.

06:09.917 --> 06:12.417
I have to study for my European history
final tomorrow.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.458
So, unless you wanna talk
about the Crimean War...

06:18.000 --> 06:18.834
Hello?

06:21.709 --> 06:22.667
Gabe: Mom.

06:24.208 --> 06:25.125
Mom!

06:26.542 --> 06:29.208
Mom! Mom!

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
- Mom!
- Gabe, what are you doing?

06:33.083 --> 06:34.959
Isn't it obvious? I'm calling mom.

06:37.583 --> 06:39.458
Mom!

06:39.542 --> 06:42.125
Dude, just go upstairs.
I'm trying to study.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.959
It's important.

06:44.667 --> 06:45.792
Mom!

06:46.583 --> 06:49.250
Oh, hey, here's my pencil.

06:51.166 --> 06:53.750
Amy: Gabe, did you need me?

06:53.834 --> 06:55.875
- Never mind.
- Amy: What?

06:55.959 --> 06:57.208
I said never mind!

06:58.208 --> 06:59.250
Amy: Okay.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.208
- Are you done?
- Yeah, I'm done.

07:03.125 --> 07:06.041
Wait, where's my ruler?

07:07.041 --> 07:09.083
Mom!

07:09.166 --> 07:11.125
-Amy: What?
- Ugh!

07:15.041 --> 07:16.000
Mom.

07:16.083 --> 07:18.542
I'm trying to study,
but Gabe keeps yelling.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.792
Sweetie, if you need a quiet place
to study,

07:20.875 --> 07:22.083
why don't you just do it here?

07:22.166 --> 07:23.667
I'm just doing my yoga.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.125
I'll put on my headphones.

07:25.208 --> 07:26.834
Won't bother you at all.

07:26.917 --> 07:28.709
- Thanks, mom.
- Amy: Mm-hm.

07:41.709 --> 07:42.917
What are you doing?

07:43.917 --> 07:45.125
The breath of fire.

07:47.417 --> 07:49.750
Well, could you extinguish it?

07:51.959 --> 07:53.583
I just lit it.

07:56.333 --> 07:58.333
I'll study in the kitchen.

07:58.792 --> 07:59.750
What?

08:02.917 --> 08:04.917
- Hi, dad.
- Hey, sweetie.

08:16.458 --> 08:19.917
Dad, how long do you think
that's gonna take?

08:20.583 --> 08:23.125
Do you want it fast
or do you want it yummy?

08:34.500 --> 08:37.125
So mom and dad were giving you.

08:37.208 --> 08:39.417
The old "new baby pep talk," huh?

08:40.959 --> 08:42.417
Well, forget it, Charlie.

08:42.959 --> 08:46.250
Once that new baby comes along,
you're just another middle child.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.875
Welcome to the forgotten kids club.

08:50.417 --> 08:51.834
I Hope you enjoyed the spotlight,

08:52.208 --> 08:53.083
'cause that's over.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.291
No, it's not.

08:57.792 --> 08:59.625
Denial. That's smart.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.959
Use that. That's what got me
through kindergarten.

09:06.375 --> 09:08.625
- Hey, honey.
- Bob, get over here.

09:08.709 --> 09:10.583
I just heard Gabe talking to Charlie.

09:11.125 --> 09:13.875
He said we're gonna forget about her
when the new baby comes along.

09:13.959 --> 09:14.917
What?

09:15.000 --> 09:17.125
How could we forget
about sweet little Charlie?

09:17.208 --> 09:20.500
- She's adorable.
- I know, but what about him?

09:20.583 --> 09:22.041
- Who?
- Gabe!

09:24.208 --> 09:25.625
He's feeling neglected.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.083
Maybe we're not spending
enough time with him.

09:29.166 --> 09:32.500
What are you talking about?
I just took him to the batting cages.

09:32.583 --> 09:33.917
When he was eight.

09:35.125 --> 09:37.875
Okay, so, what is he now, ten, eleven?

09:38.291 --> 09:39.208
Thirteen.

09:40.667 --> 09:41.917
Is he still into baseball?

09:54.166 --> 09:56.166
Uh, Mr. Hammerstone?

09:56.250 --> 09:57.333
What do you want, cupcake?

09:58.458 --> 10:00.500
- Oh, it's PJ
- Excuse me?

10:00.583 --> 10:02.250
Cupcake works. I like cupcake.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.000
Listen, I want to talk to you
about my grade.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.709
- You gave me an incomplete...
- Mm-hm.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.834
which means I can't graduate tomorrow.

10:09.917 --> 10:12.125
- Mm-hm.
- So kind of a big problem.

10:12.208 --> 10:13.125
Not for me.

10:15.208 --> 10:17.834
The thing is, though,
I only missed one unit.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.792
The most important unit of all.

10:20.542 --> 10:22.458
The one that molds you into a man.

10:23.041 --> 10:25.333
The one that combines
athleticism and discipline,

10:25.458 --> 10:28.333
and prepares you
for the hard realities of life.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.250
Square dancing?

10:31.333 --> 10:32.583
That's right, cupcake.

10:34.083 --> 10:37.041
No offense, but it just
doesn't seem that important.

10:37.125 --> 10:38.250
"Not important."

10:39.125 --> 10:41.917
What if you're walking down the street,
and, bang!

10:42.333 --> 10:44.125
A hoedown breaks out?

10:45.166 --> 10:46.500
You wouldn't be prepared.

10:47.500 --> 10:49.208
Well, you do make a good point there.

10:50.041 --> 10:53.500
Listen, I really wanna graduate on time.
Isn't there anything I can do?

10:53.583 --> 10:56.291
- Well, there is one thing.
- Yes.

10:56.375 --> 10:58.375
You can learn how to square dance
by tomorrow.

10:59.417 --> 11:00.834
Just one little problem...

11:01.500 --> 11:04.000
It's impossible.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.083
Oh, yeah?

11:05.792 --> 11:07.083
I say it can be done.

11:08.083 --> 11:09.750
I'm gonna learn how to square dance
by tomorrow.

11:12.458 --> 11:14.917
And I'm gonna stop calling
everybody cupcake.

11:15.959 --> 11:17.834
Ain't gonna happen, cupcake!

11:25.792 --> 11:26.792
- Ivy: Hey, T.
- Hi.

11:26.875 --> 11:29.041
- What are you doing here?
- Well, I didn't know what to do.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.792
- I've got no place else to go.
- What's wrong, honey?

11:31.875 --> 11:33.750
I just, I've had the worst day.

11:33.834 --> 11:36.750
I have this big final tomorrow,
and I can't find a quiet place to study.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.875
- I tried my house but--
- Was it your mom?

11:40.709 --> 11:41.583
It was everybody.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.125
Hmm. But mainly your mom.

11:43.834 --> 11:46.959
Teddy, you are always welcome here.
Come on.

11:47.291 --> 11:50.375
Go on, you just get yourself comfortable,

11:51.000 --> 11:54.208
and I will make you some tea.

11:54.709 --> 11:57.250
Um, how come you never
do any of this for me?

11:57.375 --> 11:59.333
I do this for people who study.

11:59.750 --> 12:00.709
Not worth it.

12:06.792 --> 12:08.333
Hey, there he is.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.250
There's the guy we've been waiting for.

12:14.083 --> 12:17.750
Honey, we saw this karaoke machine,
and we thought of you.

12:18.291 --> 12:19.917
Because?

12:21.375 --> 12:22.667
Because we can sing together.

12:23.208 --> 12:24.792
Because?

Am I being punished?

12:31.542 --> 12:32.375
No!

12:32.792 --> 12:35.667
Your mom and I thought we just hadn't
had enough "Gabe time" lately.

12:36.792 --> 12:37.625
Oh.

12:37.709 --> 12:40.250
You're not talking about one
of those stupid homemade coupons

12:40.333 --> 12:42.041
I gave you on Mother's Day, are you?

12:42.500 --> 12:43.625
Because those expired.

12:45.208 --> 12:47.000
No, honey, we just wanna spend
more time with you.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.667
Okay, now you look at this,

12:48.750 --> 12:51.291
and pick out any song you want.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.709

We don't have time. I gotta learn this.

13:52.125 --> 13:53.875
PJ, we've been at it for over three hours,

13:53.959 --> 13:55.834
and you still don't know
a "do-si" from a "do."

13:57.041 --> 13:58.917
Then why do you keep saying "Good, good"?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.750
Oh, I was talking about me.
I was killing it. Unh!

14:02.917 --> 14:05.166
So that's it? I'm not gonna graduate?

14:05.834 --> 14:07.625
- Sorry, buddy.
- Oh, man.

14:08.333 --> 14:12.458
After barely passing the subjects
that end in "ology" and "ometry,"

14:12.542 --> 14:15.083
I never thought it would be "ancing"
that took me down.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.375
We're wanna show you
one of our favorite movies

14:23.458 --> 14:24.417
from when we were your age.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.625
Oh, you're gonna love this.

14:25.709 --> 14:29.250
It's about a giant squid
that terrorizes a small beach community.

14:29.333 --> 14:33.375
It's called "Tentacles Over Pismo."

14:35.458 --> 14:37.625
I still have nightmares about it.

14:37.709 --> 14:40.375
But don't worry, we will be right here
with you the whole time.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.667
How much longer is "Gabe time" gonna last?

14:43.917 --> 14:44.834
Sweetie...

14:45.667 --> 14:48.625
we just want you to know that
just because you're the middle kid

14:48.709 --> 14:50.333
doesn't mean you're the forgotten kid.

14:51.625 --> 14:52.458
Oh!

14:53.166 --> 14:54.583
You guys overheard me say...

14:54.667 --> 14:56.208
Shh! Movie's starting.

14:56.500 --> 14:57.917
Come on now, snuggle with mommy.

15:01.375 --> 15:03.041
Woman: Eww! What's that?

15:03.500 --> 15:04.542
It's an arm!

15:05.291 --> 15:06.750
Man: It's eight arms.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.083
Pretty scary, huh?

15:14.750 --> 15:16.542
Come on, the squid's wearing a watch.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.750

15:30.125 --> 15:31.458

15:32.083 --> 15:33.709
Only seven more hours until this test.

15:33.792 --> 15:35.208
Come on, Teddy, focus.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.291

15:45.542 --> 15:46.542
Mrs. Wentz?

15:48.667 --> 15:50.333
Are you okay?

15:56.875 --> 15:59.750
- Oh no.
- What's going on?

15:59.834 --> 16:01.041
She's sleep-playing.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.583
She's what?

16:03.667 --> 16:05.500
You know how some people
sleepwalk and sleep-talk?

16:05.583 --> 16:07.250
My mom plays the organ in her sleep.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.208
Can you wake her up? I have to study.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.834
No, you can't wake up a sleepwalker.
It's dangerous.

16:13.917 --> 16:15.542
She'll be done soon.

16:16.250 --> 16:18.250

17:23.000 --> 17:25.959
Gabe: Charlie, I wanna talk
to you about something.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.709
- About what I said yesterday...
- Bob, Bob, get over...

17:30.792 --> 17:31.750
I, I was wrong.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.333
You don't have to worry
about mom and dad forgetting you.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.000
They might be busy,

17:36.458 --> 17:38.875
but they love us very much.

17:38.959 --> 17:42.250
- Oh, that is so sweet.
- What is?

17:46.625 --> 17:48.917
Come on.

17:49.875 --> 17:53.625
Well, I guess Gabe enjoys
being the forgotten kid.

17:53.709 --> 17:55.375
Yeah, sure sounds like it.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.917
Hey, you know, if we were to forget him,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.208
just every now and then...

18:00.291 --> 18:02.500
That would be good parenting.

18:04.542 --> 18:07.083
You know what?
I think I'm going to do my part.

18:07.208 --> 18:08.583
And forget him this week.

18:09.458 --> 18:12.709
- And I shall ignore him all weekend.
- Hmm.

18:13.834 --> 18:14.667
Feels good.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.709
Yeah, it always feels good
to do the right thing.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.333
Well, Duncan,

18:24.417 --> 18:27.458
did you master the art
of square dancing in 24 hours?

18:27.542 --> 18:28.792
Actually, no.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.875
Well, then what are you wearing
the cap and gown for?

18:30.959 --> 18:33.542
Look, my parents are out there.

18:34.208 --> 18:35.792
They really wanna see me graduate.

18:35.875 --> 18:40.000
So I came back here to appeal
to your sense of mercy.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.250
And humanity and...

18:43.542 --> 18:45.000
Do you actually have any of those?

18:45.834 --> 18:47.667
Not since I started wearing the whistle.

18:48.917 --> 18:52.041
Man over PA: I'd like to welcome this
year's south high graduating class!

18:52.959 --> 18:54.250
I'll see you in the fall, Duncan.

18:56.417 --> 18:57.333
Hey.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.250
Dad, what are you doing in here?

18:59.375 --> 19:01.083
Emmett just told me
everything that's going on,

19:01.166 --> 19:03.375
so I'm here to help you graduate.

19:03.458 --> 19:05.583
Forget it. It's over. I can't do it.

19:05.667 --> 19:08.041
Oh yes, you can. You're a Duncan.

19:08.125 --> 19:10.041
You've got square dancing in your blood.

19:10.125 --> 19:13.333
In High School,
I was a square dancing champion.

19:13.875 --> 19:15.959
Whoa, wait a minute.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.625
Are you "do-si-do Duncan"?

19:18.750 --> 19:20.667
Whatever, whatever, whatever.

19:20.750 --> 19:24.000
That's great for you, dad,
but how does that help me?

19:24.083 --> 19:26.083
It helps you like this.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.875
Okay, start with your hand up, all right?

20:28.625 --> 20:30.375

20:31.000 --> 20:32.709
I got a daughter who can't dance, either.

Great news, Charlie.

20:40.542 --> 20:43.875
Guess who got an "a"
on her European history final.

20:43.959 --> 20:45.792
Turns out, the perfect place to study

20:45.875 --> 20:48.625
is at a tow truck office
at six o'clock in the morning.

20:49.959 --> 20:51.834

20:51.917 --> 20:55.000

- I graduated! Yeah!

20:56.500 --> 20:57.875
It's upside down, honey.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.250
I still graduated.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.208
In other news,

21:03.250 --> 21:06.041
everyone in the family has picked out
two names for the new baby.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.917
Mom and dad are gonna choose
from one of these.

21:10.750 --> 21:12.000
So any favorites, mom?

21:12.083 --> 21:13.041
I'm not saying.

21:15.417 --> 21:18.500
I see that "Candy" and "Hotdog"
have made a reappearance.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.166
Hey, guys,

21:32.250 --> 21:35.125
mom and dad were talking
about this thing called potty training.

21:35.625 --> 21:36.458
What's that?

21:36.542 --> 21:38.333
You know that room at the end of the hall?

21:38.417 --> 21:39.834
The one with the weird chair?

21:41.083 --> 21:43.500
Yeah, that chair is called a toilet.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.834
They're gonna make us learn how to use it.

21:46.959 --> 21:47.917
Toilet?

21:48.250 --> 21:49.917
What's wrong with the current system?

21:51.959 --> 21:53.667
I am very happy in diapers.

21:53.750 --> 21:56.333
Me too. I love diapers.

21:57.458 --> 21:58.792
Not loving this one, though.

22:00.458 --> 22:02.250
Yeah. I could go for a change.

22:03.500 --> 22:04.500
Shall we?

22:08.834 --> 22:09.834
Amy: I'm coming.

22:10.709 --> 22:12.458
You don't get that kind of service
on the toilet.
