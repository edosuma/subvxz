01:57.710 --> 01:58.960
Did we get captured again?

01:59.250 --> 02:01.420
It's nothing. I just had a bad dream.

02:01.540 --> 02:02.750
Go back to sleep.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.920
You don't have to tell me twice.

02:04.630 --> 02:05.880
Are you all right, Aang?

02:05.960 --> 02:07.050
I'm okay.

02:07.260 --> 02:09.090
You seem to be having
a lot of nightmares lately.

02:09.180 --> 02:10.970
You want to tell me about it?

02:11.050 --> 02:12.800
I think I just need some rest.

You guys want to hear about my dream?

02:25.980 --> 02:27.570

02:29.610 --> 02:32.620
Well, we'd better
smoothly fly ourselves to a market,

02:32.700 --> 02:33.910
because we're out of food.

02:34.120 --> 02:36.160
Guys, wait. This was in my dream.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.580
We shouldn't go to the market.

02:37.660 --> 02:38.710
What happened in your dream?

02:39.120 --> 02:40.790
Food eats people!

02:41.880 --> 02:44.250

You're out of your mind, uncle.

The weather is perfect.
There's not a cloud in sight.

03:01.520 --> 03:04.310
A storm is approaching from the north.

03:04.690 --> 03:08.490
I suggest we alter our course
and head southwest.

03:08.690 --> 03:10.400
We know the Avatar
is traveling northward,

03:10.490 --> 03:12.070
so we will do the same.

03:12.490 --> 03:15.280
Prince Zuko,
consider the safety of the crew.

03:15.490 --> 03:17.740
The safety of the crew doesn't matter.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.170
Finding the Avatar
is far more important

03:24.250 --> 03:26.210
than any individual's safety.

03:30.170 --> 03:33.640
He doesn't mean that.
He's just all worked up.

03:36.970 --> 03:39.470
It's good.
It's perfect, I'm telling you.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.690
I don't know if I like
the sound of that swishing.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.310
Swishing means it's ripe.

03:45.520 --> 03:49.070
It's the ripe juices
swishing around, huh?

03:49.280 --> 03:50.570
I think it's true, Katara.

03:50.650 --> 03:51.860
Swishing means it's ripe.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.280
I just realized
we're out of money, anyway.

03:55.490 --> 03:57.280
Aww...

04:00.870 --> 04:02.790
Out of food and out of money.

04:02.870 --> 04:04.290
Now what are we supposed to do?

04:04.500 --> 04:06.250
You could get a job, smart guy.

04:07.790 --> 04:09.750
Please! The fish can wait.

04:09.840 --> 04:11.670
There's going to be a terrible storm.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.340
Aw, you're crazy. It's a nice day.

04:14.430 --> 04:16.470
No clouds, no wind, no nothing,

04:16.680 --> 04:18.470
so quit your nagging, woman.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.390
Maybe we should find some shelter.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.770
Are you kidding? Shelter from what?

04:23.980 --> 04:26.400
WOMAN: My joints say
there's going to be a storm,

04:26.480 --> 04:27.860

04:28.190 --> 04:30.900
Well, it's your joints
against my brain.

04:31.110 --> 04:33.610
Then I hope your brain can find
someone else to haul that fish,

04:33.700 --> 04:34.780
'cause I ain't coming!

04:34.990 --> 04:36.740
Then I'll find a new fish hauler,

04:36.820 --> 04:38.280
and pay him double what you get.

04:38.530 --> 04:39.530
How do you like that?

04:39.620 --> 04:40.620
I'll go.

04:40.700 --> 04:41.950
You're hired.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.210
What? You said get a job.

04:45.420 --> 04:46.710
And he's paying double.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.000
Double? Who told you that nonsense?

04:55.630 --> 04:59.050
Oh. Looks like your uncle was right
about the storm after all.

04:59.140 --> 05:00.260
Lucky guess.

05:00.350 --> 05:02.600
Lieutenant,
you'd better learn some respect,

05:03.270 --> 05:05.890
or I will teach it to you.

05:06.270 --> 05:08.560
What do you know about respect?

05:10.270 --> 05:12.780
The way you talk
to everyone around here,

05:12.980 --> 05:15.650
from your hard-working crew
to your esteemed uncle,

05:15.860 --> 05:18.950
shows you know nothing about respect.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.830
You don't care about
anyone but yourself.

05:22.040 --> 05:26.040
Then again, what should I expect
from a spoiled prince?

05:30.040 --> 05:31.250
Easy now.

05:34.760 --> 05:36.010
Enough!

05:36.470 --> 05:40.350
We're all a bit tired
from being at sea so long.

05:40.930 --> 05:43.060
I'm sure after a bowl of noodles,

05:43.260 --> 05:46.140
everyone will feel much better.

05:48.940 --> 05:51.520
I don't need your help
keeping order on my ship.

06:00.110 --> 06:02.740
Sokka, maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.990
Look at the sky.

06:04.080 --> 06:05.620
I said I was gonna do this job.

06:05.700 --> 06:07.830
I can't back out just because
of some bad weather.

06:08.870 --> 06:11.250
WOMAN: The boy with the tattoos
has some sense.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.420
You should listen to him.

06:12.630 --> 06:14.750
Boy with tattoos?

06:14.960 --> 06:16.970
Airbender tattoos.

06:17.300 --> 06:20.010
Well, I'll be a hog monkey's uncle.

06:20.090 --> 06:21.510
You're the Avatar, ain't you?

06:21.800 --> 06:22.890
That's right.

06:23.140 --> 06:24.850
Well, don't be so smiley about it.

06:26.220 --> 06:28.730
The Avatar disappeared
for a hundred years!

06:28.980 --> 06:30.850
You turned your back on the world.

06:31.060 --> 06:32.730
Don't yell at him!

06:32.810 --> 06:34.900
Aang would never
turn his back on anyone.

06:35.150 --> 06:37.110
Oh, he wouldn't, huh?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.030
Then I guess I must have imagined

06:39.110 --> 06:42.240
the last hundred years
of war and suffering.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.910
Aang is the bravest person I know.

06:45.120 --> 06:46.910
He has done nothing but help people,

06:47.000 --> 06:49.250
and save lives since I met him.

06:49.460 --> 06:51.920
It's not his fault he disappeared,
right, Aang?

06:52.130 --> 06:53.670
Aang, what's wrong?

06:56.840 --> 06:58.880
That's right! Keep flying!

06:59.090 --> 07:00.680
You're a horrible old man!

07:00.880 --> 07:01.930
Ehh!

07:05.100 --> 07:06.970
Appa, yip yip!

07:07.060 --> 07:08.140
Uhh!

07:08.220 --> 07:10.390
Hey! They left
without saying good-bye.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.560
Your friends ain't too polite,
are they?

07:12.850 --> 07:14.690
I know. This one time, I wasâ€•

07:14.770 --> 07:16.690
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get below deck.

07:37.130 --> 07:38.760
I'm sorry for running away.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.510
It's okay. That fisherman
was way out of line.

07:42.220 --> 07:44.050
Actually, he wasn't.

07:44.260 --> 07:46.640
What do you mean?

07:46.850 --> 07:48.510
I don't want to talk about it.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.270
It has to do with your dream,
doesn't it?

07:51.480 --> 07:52.890
Talk to me.

07:53.100 --> 07:55.400
Well, it's kind of a long story.

07:55.480 --> 07:57.190
APPA: ( GRUMBLING )

08:01.400 --> 08:03.700
I'm gonna try to get
a little fire going.

08:06.990 --> 08:09.910
I'll never forget the day
the monks told me I was the Avatar.

08:12.210 --> 08:15.210
<i>I was playing with some other kids
just outside the south wall.</i>

08:15.460 --> 08:17.880
<i>I was trying to teach them
how to do the air scooter.</i>

08:18.170 --> 08:21.380
First you form a ball.
Then you've got to get on quick.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.380
Ha ha ha!

08:24.590 --> 08:26.590
Yeah! Ha ha ha!

08:26.680 --> 08:28.260
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

08:28.760 --> 08:31.220
Okay, here goes.

08:31.430 --> 08:32.430
Quick. Get on.

08:32.520 --> 08:34.980
Whoa. Whoa...

08:35.060 --> 08:36.730
Uhh!

08:37.060 --> 08:39.150
You kind of have to balance on it
like it's a top.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.070
Man, that's hard.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.690
Where did you learn that trick, Aang?

08:42.860 --> 08:43.990
I made it up.

08:44.070 --> 08:45.610
Wow!

08:45.820 --> 08:47.780
GYATSO: Aang, come with us.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.780
We need to speak with you.

08:57.130 --> 08:58.710
AANG: How do you know it's me?

08:58.790 --> 09:02.130
We have known you were
the Avatar for some time.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.130
Do you remember these?

09:08.890 --> 09:11.640
Those were some of my favorite toys
when I was little.

09:11.850 --> 09:14.770
You chose them
from among thousands of toys, Aang.

09:15.140 --> 09:18.980
The toys you picked
were the four Avatar relics.

09:19.270 --> 09:22.150
These items belonged to Avatars past.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.400
Your own past lives.

09:24.490 --> 09:26.570
I just chose them
because they seemed fun.

09:27.240 --> 09:29.780
You chose them
because they were familiar.

09:30.200 --> 09:34.620
Normally, we would have told you
of your identity when you turned 16.

09:35.000 --> 09:37.460
But there are troubling signs.

09:37.670 --> 09:40.500
Storm clouds are gathering.

09:40.920 --> 09:44.420
I fear that war may be upon us,
young Avatar.

09:44.630 --> 09:46.130
We need you, Aang.

09:53.970 --> 09:55.890
I'm sick of taking his orders,

09:56.100 --> 09:58.020
and I'm tired of chasing his Avatar.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.520
I mean, who does Zuko think he is?

10:00.730 --> 10:02.480
Do you really want to know?

10:02.690 --> 10:04.480
General Iroh, we were justâ€•

10:04.570 --> 10:06.110
It's okay.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.610
May I join you?

10:07.700 --> 10:08.740
Of course, sir.

10:12.620 --> 10:14.290
Try to understand,

10:14.540 --> 10:16.910
my nephew is a complicated young man.

10:17.160 --> 10:19.000
He has been through much.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.510
Let me in!

10:26.590 --> 10:28.380
Prince Zuko, what's wrong?

10:28.590 --> 10:30.010
I want to go into the war chamber,

10:30.090 --> 10:31.840
but the guard won't let me pass.

10:31.930 --> 10:34.430
You're not missing anything. Trust me.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.430
These meetings are dreadfully boring.

10:37.730 --> 10:39.730
If I'm going to rule
this nation one day,

10:39.810 --> 10:42.150
don't you think I need
to start learning as much as I can?

10:43.150 --> 10:46.860
Very well,
but you must promise not to speak.

10:47.190 --> 10:49.780
These old folks are a bit sensitive,
you know?

10:49.990 --> 10:52.070
Thank you, uncle.

10:58.330 --> 11:01.580
The Earth Kingdom defenses
are concentrated here,

11:01.670 --> 11:04.290
a dangerous battalion
of their strongest earthbenders,

11:04.380 --> 11:06.170
and fiercest warriors.

11:06.500 --> 11:09.590
So, I am recommending
the 41st division.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.510
But the 41st is entirely new recruits.

11:12.720 --> 11:16.310
How do you expect them to defeat
a powerful Earth Kingdom battalion?

11:16.510 --> 11:18.560
I don't.

11:18.770 --> 11:20.310
They'll be used as a distraction

11:20.390 --> 11:22.310
while we mount an attack
from the rear.

11:22.770 --> 11:26.520
What better to use as bait
than fresh meat?

11:26.940 --> 11:29.280
You can't sacrifice
an entire division like that!

11:29.360 --> 11:31.490
Those soldiers love
and defend our nation.

11:31.570 --> 11:32.910
How can you betray them?

11:36.120 --> 11:37.740
Zuko was right, you see?

11:38.160 --> 11:41.120
But it was not his place to speak out.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.920
And there were dire consequences.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.960
So you were upset
that you were the Avatar?

11:49.670 --> 11:51.510
Why wouldn't you be excited about it?

11:51.670 --> 11:54.090
Well, I didn't know
how to feel about it.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.390
All I knew was that after I found out,

11:56.720 --> 11:58.260
everything began changing.

11:59.180 --> 12:00.600
AANG: Hey, not bad.

12:00.680 --> 12:01.930
You guys have been practicing.

12:02.270 --> 12:03.640
Not only that,

12:03.730 --> 12:06.650
we made up a game you can play
with the air scooters.

12:06.860 --> 12:07.940
Great!

12:12.700 --> 12:13.820
What's going on?

12:14.200 --> 12:15.660
Now that you're the Avatar,

12:15.870 --> 12:17.490
it's kind of an unfair advantage

12:17.700 --> 12:19.080
for whichever team you're on.

12:19.290 --> 12:20.580
But I'm still the same.

12:20.790 --> 12:22.620
Nothing has changed.

12:22.710 --> 12:25.250
So, what? I can't play?

12:25.460 --> 12:26.960
That's the only fair way.

12:27.170 --> 12:29.710
Oh, okay...

12:29.800 --> 12:31.630
Sorry, Aang.

12:32.720 --> 12:35.380
Okay, now, who wants
to have Jinju on their team?

12:35.590 --> 12:36.640
( LAUGHS )

12:45.350 --> 12:48.020
Very interesting move, young one.

12:48.150 --> 12:49.770
What do you mean?

12:54.320 --> 12:56.490
Hey! Ha ha ha!

12:56.700 --> 12:58.990
Ha ha ha!

12:59.700 --> 13:01.040
You're playing games with him?

13:01.200 --> 13:03.370
The Avatar should be training.

13:03.580 --> 13:06.170
Aang has already
trained enough for today.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.500
Time is short. Come with me.

13:08.580 --> 13:11.380
I must test you
on some high-level techniques.

13:11.800 --> 13:14.220
No. As long as I am his guardian,

13:14.300 --> 13:16.300
I will decide when he trains

13:16.590 --> 13:19.180
And when he gets his butt kicked
at Pai Sho.

13:19.600 --> 13:20.850
Hmmph!

13:26.890 --> 13:30.190
After Zuko's outburst in the meeting,

13:30.270 --> 13:33.860
<i>the Fire Lord became
very angry with him.</i>

13:34.860 --> 13:38.070
<i>He said that Prince Zuko's
challenge of the general</i>

13:38.280 --> 13:42.200
was an act of complete disrespect.

13:42.410 --> 13:45.790
And there was only one way
to resolve this.

13:45.870 --> 13:48.580
Agni Kai. A fire duel.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.670
That's right.

13:50.750 --> 13:54.010
Zuko looked upon
the old general he had insulted,

13:54.090 --> 13:56.760
and declared that he was not afraid.

13:57.220 --> 13:59.760
<i>But Zuko misunderstood.</i>

13:59.970 --> 14:02.260
<i>When he turned to face his opponent,</i>

14:02.470 --> 14:05.600
<i>he was surprised to see
it was not the general.</i>

14:05.890 --> 14:09.730
<i>Zuko had spoken out
against the general's plan,</i>

14:09.810 --> 14:12.820
<i>but by doing so
in the Fire Lord's war room,</i>

14:13.020 --> 14:16.940
<i>it was the Fire Lord
whom he had disrespected.</i>

14:17.610 --> 14:22.410
<i>Zuko would have to duel
his own father.</i>

14:24.120 --> 14:26.660
Then, just when
I was starting to feel better,

14:26.750 --> 14:28.540
something worse happened.

14:28.710 --> 14:31.210
Aang needs to have freedom and fun.

14:31.420 --> 14:34.630
He needs to grow up as a normal boy.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.090
Hmm. You cannot keep protecting him
from his destiny.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.010
Gyatso, I know you mean well,

14:41.220 --> 14:44.810
but you are letting your affection
for the boy cloud your judgment.

14:44.890 --> 14:48.480
All I want is what is best for him.

14:48.680 --> 14:51.810
But what we need
is what's best for the world.

14:54.610 --> 14:57.820
You and Aang must be separated.

14:57.900 --> 15:00.740
The Avatar will be sent away
to the Eastern Air Temple

15:00.950 --> 15:02.700
to complete his training.

15:13.460 --> 15:14.920
That's awful, Aang.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.340
I don't know what to say.

15:17.420 --> 15:19.050
How could they do that to me?

15:19.130 --> 15:20.670
They wanted to take away
everything I knew,

15:20.760 --> 15:22.010
and everyone I loved!

15:22.220 --> 15:24.140
Whoa! Hot cinders.

15:25.470 --> 15:27.310
I'm sorry I got so mad.

15:27.850 --> 15:29.230
You have a right to be angry

15:29.310 --> 15:30.770
after the monks
sent you away like that.

15:31.230 --> 15:33.850
Well, that's not exactly
what happened.

15:34.270 --> 15:35.860
( LAUGHING )

15:39.070 --> 15:41.240
<i>I was afraid and confused.</i>

15:41.450 --> 15:43.280
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

15:49.290 --> 15:51.160
Aang?

15:51.250 --> 15:53.750
I'm not going to let them
take you away from me.

15:53.960 --> 15:55.130
Aang?

15:59.050 --> 16:00.170
( GASPS )

16:03.340 --> 16:05.640
<i>I never saw Gyatso again.</i>

<i>Next thing I knew,
I was waking up in your arms</i>

16:23.610 --> 16:25.740
<i>after you found me in the iceberg.</i>

16:29.080 --> 16:30.200
You ran away.

16:30.580 --> 16:33.040
And then the Fire Nation
attacked our temple.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.210
My people needed me,
and I wasn't there to help.

16:35.580 --> 16:36.960
You don't know what would haveâ€•

16:37.040 --> 16:38.790
The world needed me,
and I wasn't there to help.

16:39.130 --> 16:41.010
- Aang...
- The fisherman was right.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.880
I did turn my back on the world.

16:43.340 --> 16:45.380
You're being too hard on yourself.

16:45.470 --> 16:46.840
Even if you did run away,

16:47.180 --> 16:49.010
I think it was meant to be.

16:49.390 --> 16:50.970
If you had stayed,
you would have been killed

16:51.060 --> 16:52.770
along with all the other airbenders.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.390
You don't know that.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.520
I know it's meant to be this way.

16:56.980 --> 16:59.940
The world needs you now.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.280
You give people hope.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.360
( CHATTERS )

17:07.570 --> 17:10.330
IROH: When Prince Zuko saw
that it was his father

17:10.410 --> 17:12.370
who had come to duel him,

17:12.490 --> 17:14.040
he begged for mercy.

17:15.960 --> 17:17.250
Please, father,

17:17.330 --> 17:19.340
I only had the Fire Nation's
best interests at heart.

17:19.540 --> 17:20.920
I'm sorry I spoke out of turn.

17:21.420 --> 17:24.170
You will fight for your honor.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.510
I meant you no disrespect.

17:26.590 --> 17:27.840
I am your loyal son.

17:28.180 --> 17:31.350
Rise and fight, Prince Zuko.

17:31.430 --> 17:33.100
I won't fight you.

17:33.350 --> 17:35.640
You will learn respect,

17:36.140 --> 17:39.610
and suffering will be your teacher.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.690
IROH: <i>I looked away.</i>

17:43.900 --> 17:46.320
ZUKO: ( SCREAMING )

17:48.780 --> 17:52.950
I always thought that Prince Zuko
was in a training accident.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.750
It was no accident.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.750
After the duel,

17:57.830 --> 18:01.340
the Fire Lord said
that by refusing to fight,

18:02.040 --> 18:04.960
Zuko had shown shameful weakness.

18:05.380 --> 18:07.630
As punishment, he was banished,

18:07.720 --> 18:10.800
and sent to capture the Avatar.

18:11.220 --> 18:14.890
Only then could he return
with his honor.

18:15.270 --> 18:18.020
So that's why he's so obsessed.

18:18.310 --> 18:20.730
Capturing the Avatar
is the only chance he has

18:20.810 --> 18:23.070
of things returning to normal.

18:23.230 --> 18:25.320
Things will never return to normal,

18:25.480 --> 18:27.950
but the important thing is,

18:28.150 --> 18:30.530
the Avatar gives Zuko hope.

18:47.380 --> 18:50.090
Help! Oh, please, help!

18:50.470 --> 18:52.470
It's okay. You're safe.

18:52.550 --> 18:54.350
But my husband isn't.

18:54.430 --> 18:56.600
What do you mean? Where's Sokka?

18:56.850 --> 18:58.270
They haven't returned.

18:58.350 --> 18:59.890
They should have been back by now.

19:00.020 --> 19:02.230
And this storm is becoming a typhoon.

19:02.480 --> 19:04.060
They're caught out at sea!

19:04.360 --> 19:05.690
I'm going to find them.

19:05.900 --> 19:06.940
I'm going with you.

19:07.150 --> 19:08.240
I'm staying here.

19:11.110 --> 19:13.570
We'll be back soon. I promise.

Look!

ZUKO: The helmsman!

19:43.150 --> 19:44.310
Aah!

19:54.450 --> 19:55.780
Where are they?

19:58.910 --> 20:00.910
Come on, Appa!

20:11.880 --> 20:13.680
The boat! There!

20:16.300 --> 20:17.680
The Avatar!

20:17.760 --> 20:20.350
What do you want to do, sir?

20:20.430 --> 20:21.980
Let him go.

20:22.060 --> 20:23.980
We need to get this ship to safety.

20:24.190 --> 20:28.070
Then we must head directly
into the eye of the storm.

20:36.870 --> 20:38.620
I'm too young to die!

20:38.700 --> 20:40.490
I'm not, but I still don't want to!

Your apology is accepted.

22:15.710 --> 22:17.800
Oh! You're alive!

22:18.430 --> 22:20.340
You owe this boy an apology.

22:20.430 --> 22:22.260
He doesn't have to apologize.

22:22.350 --> 22:25.140
What if, instead of an apology,

22:25.220 --> 22:27.640
I give him a free fish,
and we call it even?

22:27.850 --> 22:29.600
Actually, I don't eat meat.

22:29.730 --> 22:31.060
Fish ain't meat.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.610
Seriously, you're still gonna pay me,
right?

22:34.900 --> 22:35.900
Aah!

22:36.150 --> 22:38.030
Katara, I think you were right before.

I'm done dwelling on the past.

Really?

I can't make guesses about
how things would have turned out

22:43.120 --> 22:44.330
If I hadn't run away.

I'm here now, and I'm going
to make the most of it.

I don't think you're gonna have
those nightmares anymore.

22:52.540 --> 22:54.960
Well, I guess, I wouldn't be either.
