WEBVTT

00:19.721 --> 00:21.288
What did you want?

00:23.758 --> 00:24.659
Is this okay?

00:27.127 --> 00:29.096
My, my zoom camera is...

00:32.432 --> 00:35.035
We met through our fathers,

00:36.169 --> 00:38.372
because our fathers
were good friends.

00:40.708 --> 00:43.210
My sister-in-law's mother

00:43.243 --> 00:46.681
arranged a meeting
between Tanya and me.

00:46.714 --> 00:51.418
I finished my university
education and got my first job.

00:51.451 --> 00:55.322
And this is when my
uncle actually asked me,

00:55.355 --> 00:58.191
"Are you ready to get married?"

00:58.225 --> 01:00.193
You know, "Can you
look for somebody?"

01:00.227 --> 01:01.663
We first met on Shaadi.com,

01:01.696 --> 01:05.767
basically the Indian
version of Match.com.

01:05.800 --> 01:08.335
And it was a very
common matrimonial site.

01:09.469 --> 01:11.171
So arranged
marriages are usually

01:11.204 --> 01:13.575
when the families have already,

01:13.608 --> 01:14.842
the families know each other

01:14.876 --> 01:18.846
and they feel that their kids
would be good for each other.

01:19.881 --> 01:21.583
A lot of Shaadi.com I think

01:21.616 --> 01:24.519
is profiles that are
done by their parents.

01:24.552 --> 01:27.722
In our case we each
wrote our own profile.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.256
Although my parents were
definitely pushing me

01:29.289 --> 01:30.490
to get married at that point,

01:30.525 --> 01:33.193
and probably had a profile for
me that I don't know about.

01:34.929 --> 01:36.598
Once we went back to our hotel

01:36.631 --> 01:38.332
and my mom and dad asked me,

01:38.365 --> 01:40.668
"So is it a yes or no?"

01:40.702 --> 01:42.637
And I was like,

01:42.670 --> 01:44.672
"Just give me an hour
or two to think."

01:44.706 --> 01:46.741
And I took that hour

01:46.774 --> 01:49.711
and it just got, it
was a gut feeling that

01:49.744 --> 01:52.714
he seems to be a nice guy and
I'm going to give it a try.

01:54.949 --> 01:58.385
It's not a bad idea to
know a person somewhat

01:59.821 --> 02:03.658
before committing to a
lifelong life together.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.278
Ravi
is a really good boy.

02:25.312 --> 02:29.249
I have three sons and
Ravi is the best one.

02:29.282 --> 02:31.251
I tell them that also.

02:31.284 --> 02:32.419
Ravi is the youngest,

02:32.452 --> 02:34.922
but he is the most
mature at heart.

02:34.956 --> 02:38.258
He loves cooking
with his mother.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.595
Vegetarian is a must for us.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.664
Also no alcoholic.

02:43.998 --> 02:47.635
He works as a researcher
with the local university.

02:47.669 --> 02:49.637
He likes his job so much

02:49.671 --> 02:53.240
that he has no
hobbies by choice.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.409
Our family does not
believe in secrets

02:55.442 --> 02:58.913
so I will mention that Ravi
is genetically predisposed

02:58.946 --> 03:01.916
to hypertension, asthma,
and he was fat as a child,

03:01.949 --> 03:04.752
so diabetes is a concern.

03:04.786 --> 03:07.254
If interested,
please message me.

03:15.563 --> 03:17.799
Rita
is a free spirit girl

03:17.832 --> 03:20.702
with strict moral values.

03:20.735 --> 03:23.771
Her hobbies include caring
for her future in-laws

03:24.906 --> 03:27.608
and her ideal date is
cooking for her man

03:27.642 --> 03:29.877
and watching a Bollywood movie.

03:30.845 --> 03:33.313
Rita is pescetarian by diet,

03:33.346 --> 03:37.852
but she is willing to be fully
veg for the right family.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.855
Please write us a message
so we can start chat

03:40.888 --> 03:42.924
and marry our children.

03:42.957 --> 03:44.792
US citizens only.

03:56.070 --> 03:58.039
Is this okay
or is it too weird?

03:58.072 --> 03:59.607
It's not too weird.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.042
I want to
apologize again for...

04:01.075 --> 04:03.578
Oh, it's fine, really?

04:03.611 --> 04:05.479
It just looked so
different on Google Images.

04:05.513 --> 04:06.748
It's really fine.

04:07.882 --> 04:09.449
It's just
on the website.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.417
A what?

04:10.450 --> 04:12.053
It said it was
full of water and fish

04:12.086 --> 04:13.353
on the website.

04:14.088 --> 04:14.956
Oh.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.492
You know, we're outside,

04:18.526 --> 04:20.795
we could lower our
masks if you want.

04:30.004 --> 04:32.006
I'm really glad this
timing worked out.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.007
Me too.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.474
Usually on work trips,

04:34.509 --> 04:35.643
my colleagues, they just like go

04:35.676 --> 04:37.410
to a strip club or something

04:37.444 --> 04:40.815
and I end up back in the hotel
just talking to my mother.

04:41.816 --> 04:43.518
But I guess today you're my mom.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.521
Yes.

04:48.355 --> 04:50.323
I'm really sorry again about-

04:50.357 --> 04:53.393
- Really, you don't
have to apologize.

04:53.426 --> 04:55.897
I love empty reservoirs.

04:55.930 --> 05:00.935
Wow,
you're so funny.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.370
We have great banter.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.305
Could you move back
a few more inches?

05:06.974 --> 05:08.475
Yeah.

05:08.509 --> 05:09.409
A lot of ants.

05:09.442 --> 05:10.645
Okay, thank you.

05:10.678 --> 05:13.346
I usually don't sweat this much.

05:15.049 --> 05:16.083
It's like we're in India.

05:16.117 --> 05:17.618
What?

05:17.652 --> 05:18.753
It's like we're in
India because it's so hot

05:18.786 --> 05:21.321
and we're both brown,
and it's dirty.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.592
This is probably
how our parents met.

05:24.625 --> 05:26.027
You know, it's
kind of beautiful.

05:26.060 --> 05:27.494
So what did you bring?

05:27.528 --> 05:30.463
Oh, I couldn't get
everything I wanted.

05:31.599 --> 05:33.734
Oh, don't worry,
it is vegetarian.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.069
Oh.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.237
What?

05:36.270 --> 05:39.040
Oh, it's just your mom
told me that you don't drink.

05:39.073 --> 05:40.440
I don't.

05:40.473 --> 05:43.978
Well, I think this
is hard lemonade.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.713
There's alcohol in this?

05:45.746 --> 05:47.915
Yeah, five percent.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.484
I'm so sorry.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.887
It's okay,

05:52.920 --> 05:54.088
- you don't have to do that.
- The store was really busy

05:54.121 --> 05:55.523
and I panicked and I
just, I love lemonade.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.657
It was a mistake.

05:56.691 --> 05:58.726
I swear on my
entire family's life,

05:58.759 --> 06:00.460
I don't drink.

06:00.493 --> 06:02.462
I don't drink either, so.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.065
This must be very
distressing for you.

06:04.098 --> 06:05.566
It is, thank God.

06:05.600 --> 06:06.968
Oh, oh no.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.470
Oh, this is a little
bit of a mess.

06:10.504 --> 06:11.939
Oh, oh, no.

06:11.973 --> 06:13.140
It's really wet.

06:16.677 --> 06:17.511
Oh God.

06:18.746 --> 06:22.083
So how much longer do you
think all this will go on for?

06:22.116 --> 06:26.087
Oh, you probably shouldn't
touch your face with the gloves.

06:26.120 --> 06:27.822
Oh.

06:37.798 --> 06:39.667
Are you seeing this?

06:40.801 --> 06:41.936
It went well.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.071
Yeah, no mom,
I didn't drive here.

06:44.105 --> 06:45.606
I took the train, remember?

06:46.741 --> 06:47.975
I don't know
Mom, it's just one date.

06:48.009 --> 06:50.945
No, I think you should wait
to call her parents tomorrow.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.513
I didn't check his hairline.

06:52.546 --> 06:53.915
Yeah, the
train's canceled.

06:53.948 --> 06:55.683
I'm actually just waiting
for the car rental agency

06:55.716 --> 06:57.018
to call me back.

06:57.051 --> 06:58.753
He seems loyal, yeah.

06:58.786 --> 07:00.755
No, she didn't
bring up eating fish.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.489
No, he doesn't seem gay.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.225
Yeah, no, Mom, we
didn't talk about Modi.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.092
Okay.

07:05.126 --> 07:06.459
Talk to you later, bye.

07:06.493 --> 07:07.662
Okay, I love you, mom.

07:07.695 --> 07:08.529
Bye.

07:15.503 --> 07:17.505
I love your place.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.471
Oh, thanks.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.741
I didn't realize you
live with roommates.

07:20.775 --> 07:21.642
I don't.

07:23.244 --> 07:24.845
Right.

07:24.879 --> 07:26.948
Oh, Rachel at the
car agency said

07:26.981 --> 07:28.582
she'd call me back.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.449
When?

07:30.518 --> 07:33.020
Oh, they didn't say when.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.624
Should have asked that.

07:37.992 --> 07:38.960
That's okay.

07:38.993 --> 07:41.829
You can just wait here
until they call back.

07:41.862 --> 07:42.697
Thank you.

07:42.730 --> 07:43.564
I'll pay you rent.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.899
Oh, that's fine.

07:44.932 --> 07:46.100
I'm joking.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.034
I'm just gonna
go wash my hands.

07:47.068 --> 07:49.203
Yeah, no, yeah, go, of course.

07:56.978 --> 07:57.845
Oh, God.

08:05.753 --> 08:07.088
Ah, much better.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.958
Oh, that's not mine.

08:10.992 --> 08:12.293
Oh, of course.

08:12.326 --> 08:15.663
No, that's my landlord.

08:15.696 --> 08:17.832
My landlord just comes
in here and drinks.

08:17.865 --> 08:18.766
Oh.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.201
Yeah, he really likes the TV

08:20.234 --> 08:22.169
so he watches the
game and drinks beer.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.505
Where's the TV?

08:25.172 --> 08:26.073
Are you hungry?

08:27.908 --> 08:29.643
Now that my career's
in such a good place,

08:29.677 --> 08:30.878
I'll get married this year,

08:30.911 --> 08:32.246
have kids a year after that.

08:32.279 --> 08:33.948
We'll all live with my mother.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.850
I'm actually closing
in on a house.

08:35.883 --> 08:36.884
How many?

08:36.917 --> 08:37.752
What?

08:37.785 --> 08:38.619
Kids.

08:38.652 --> 08:39.286
Three.

08:39.320 --> 08:40.287
Wow.

08:40.321 --> 08:42.089
Are you okay with three?

08:43.057 --> 08:44.859
- Yes.
- I can also do two.

08:44.892 --> 08:45.926
No, three is good.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.094
Yeah, I prefer three.

08:48.329 --> 08:49.864
I just have to say

08:49.897 --> 08:52.767
it's so refreshing
to meet someone

08:52.800 --> 08:55.169
with the same values,
you know, the same-

08:56.604 --> 08:57.838
Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:57.872 --> 08:59.974
It's the car rental.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.977
Hi, hello?

09:03.010 --> 09:03.878
Yes.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.114
And that's the earliest?

09:08.716 --> 09:10.317
Yeah, no, I'll take it.

09:10.351 --> 09:12.920
Yeah, you can just charge
the card that's on the file.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.990
All right, thank you so much.

09:16.023 --> 09:16.891
Bye.

09:19.693 --> 09:21.295
They said they don't
have anything available

09:21.328 --> 09:24.899
until tomorrow morning.

09:24.932 --> 09:27.701
So I think I can just look up

09:27.735 --> 09:29.236
a hotel or something
really quick.

09:29.270 --> 09:30.838
I think there's one
in this town, right?

09:30.871 --> 09:33.941
Yes, the Sunset on Belmonte.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.042
- Got it.
- Mhmm.

09:35.943 --> 09:36.811
Oh.

09:37.711 --> 09:38.879
It's saying it's closed.

09:40.281 --> 09:41.248
What?

09:41.282 --> 09:42.116
Yeah.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.722
I guess,

09:50.091 --> 09:52.126
you could use my couch.

09:52.159 --> 09:54.195
Oh my God, are you sure?

09:54.228 --> 09:56.730
That would be amazing.

09:56.764 --> 09:57.731
Of course.

09:58.933 --> 10:00.868
Yeah, I have an extra
pillow, I think.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.770
Okay, thank you so much.

10:02.803 --> 10:03.904
No worries.

10:03.938 --> 10:05.106
I'll go call my parents

10:05.139 --> 10:06.974
and let them know
you're staying over.

10:07.007 --> 10:07.975
Okay, I'll do the same.

10:08.008 --> 10:08.876
Okay.

10:16.750 --> 10:19.954
Yeah, no, mom, I don't
really have any other choice.

10:19.987 --> 10:22.823
Yeah, she's asking
her parents right now.

10:22.857 --> 10:24.992
No, mom, we won't hug tightly.

10:25.025 --> 10:27.294
She's a very traditional girl.

10:27.328 --> 10:29.930
- Hi, Daddy.
- Okay, I love you too.

10:29.964 --> 10:30.831
Bye.

10:33.801 --> 10:34.702
Yeah.

10:36.937 --> 10:38.205
I've missed you like crazy.

10:42.877 --> 10:44.945
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

10:48.449 --> 10:49.283
Daddy?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.086
I want your cock.

10:56.190 --> 11:01.195
No, Daddy, yes!

11:20.981 --> 11:25.319
This
can't be happening.

11:27.321 --> 11:28.189
Oh.

11:58.919 --> 11:59.753
Hey!

11:59.787 --> 12:01.488
Hey, hey, hey!

12:01.523 --> 12:02.389
You okay?

12:02.423 --> 12:04.792
Yeah, I'm great.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.960
Are you okay?

12:05.993 --> 12:07.895
Yeah, I just set up the couch.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.297
My parents are comfortable
with you staying the night

12:10.331 --> 12:11.932
as long as you sleep out here.

12:11.966 --> 12:14.268
They're old fashioned, like me.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.370
That's great.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.506
Okay, well, I'm going
to call it a night.

12:18.540 --> 12:20.040
Okay, good night.

12:20.074 --> 12:21.809
Good night.

12:39.293 --> 12:40.528
Hi, I was just
going to head out

12:40.562 --> 12:42.263
to the car rental place early.

12:42.296 --> 12:43.864
Oh, you sure?

12:43.897 --> 12:45.399
Yes, I am very sure.

12:46.534 --> 12:48.235
Well, sorry I
don't have a car.

12:48.269 --> 12:49.470
Otherwise I would've driven you.

12:49.504 --> 12:50.437
Yeah it's okay,

12:50.471 --> 12:51.872
you've already said enough.

12:51.905 --> 12:55.909
I mean, you've done
enough for me, so.

12:58.112 --> 12:59.280
Okay.

12:59.313 --> 13:02.283
Well I guess this
is goodbye then.

13:02.316 --> 13:03.217
Yes, bye.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.822
Longest first date
ever.

13:08.856 --> 13:09.490
It was.

13:12.226 --> 13:13.060
Keep in touch.

13:13.093 --> 13:14.161
No.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.429
What?

13:15.462 --> 13:18.098
I meant yes, maybe.

13:19.233 --> 13:20.100
Okay.

13:24.405 --> 13:28.075
For fuck's sake.

13:29.476 --> 13:30.344
Ugh!

13:38.452 --> 13:39.320
Mm!

13:42.222 --> 13:43.090
Oh my god.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.094
I missed you.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.868
I tried knocking.

13:54.902 --> 13:56.337
The car rental place called.

13:56.370 --> 13:58.939
They said they won't have a
car for another three days.

14:01.609 --> 14:04.978
There's no more rooms left
because of shelter in place.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.614
You're not going
to tell her, right?

14:06.648 --> 14:07.615
Who?

14:07.649 --> 14:08.482
Your mom?

14:08.516 --> 14:09.983
No.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.619
I assume you tell
her everything.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.088
I don't tell her everything.

14:14.121 --> 14:14.988
I won't tell her.

14:17.124 --> 14:20.528
Okay, because your
mom will tell my mom and

14:21.563 --> 14:22.963
she pays for this place.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.466
It's why I have to
go on these dates.

14:26.534 --> 14:27.635
That's the deal.

14:29.504 --> 14:32.039
Oh yeah, I won't talk.

14:32.072 --> 14:34.141
Okay, thank you, really.

14:35.209 --> 14:38.112
And you know, I'm sorry.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.448
I just, I do
think though, that,

14:43.250 --> 14:44.952
I think you're not my wife.

14:45.653 --> 14:47.154
Okay.

14:47.187 --> 14:48.355
I mean this in a delicate way.

14:48.389 --> 14:50.625
There was some deception
that's happened

14:50.658 --> 14:52.393
and it just feels wrong now.

14:52.426 --> 14:53.528
Totally.

14:53.561 --> 14:54.729
- Yeah.
- That makes sense.

14:54.763 --> 14:57.665
I think we'll find someone
for ourselves that's better.

14:57.699 --> 14:59.066
I agree.

14:59.099 --> 15:00.000
Okay, I was a
little bit worried

15:00.033 --> 15:01.503
that you were catching feelings.

15:01.536 --> 15:04.004
I think it's okay to move on.

15:04.037 --> 15:04.905
Mhmm.

15:08.142 --> 15:09.410
And were you
just, you were just,

15:09.443 --> 15:11.579
so you were just
pretending before?

15:11.613 --> 15:13.013
What do you mean?

15:13.046 --> 15:15.048
It just, you said
you didn't eat meat,

15:15.082 --> 15:16.483
and then, you know, I saw you.

15:17.451 --> 15:19.521
You're still eating chicken, so.

15:20.688 --> 15:24.191
When did you start eating meat?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.593
Oh, like few weeks ago.

15:25.627 --> 15:27.494
Oh, that's not that bad.

15:27.529 --> 15:30.063
Well, I restarted after
I took a month off, so

15:31.131 --> 15:33.200
in total, I think
since like high school.

15:35.637 --> 15:38.305
Thanks again
for letting me stay here.

15:38.338 --> 15:39.239
Of course.

15:39.273 --> 15:40.407
I'm not a monster.

15:40.441 --> 15:42.042
Yeah, I know, but I'm
a complete stranger.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.343
Well it's not the first time

15:43.377 --> 15:45.179
I've let a stranger
stay with me.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.614
You mean?

15:46.648 --> 15:47.981
Yeah.

15:48.015 --> 15:49.551
You sounded different before.

15:49.584 --> 15:50.518
What do you mean?

15:50.552 --> 15:52.486
Oh, no, you just,
your voice just, yeah.

15:52.520 --> 15:53.954
You sounded like Siri.

15:54.722 --> 15:56.323
Siri?

15:56.356 --> 15:57.759
I just, I felt
like I could tell you

15:57.792 --> 15:59.226
anything without judgment.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.730
You mean I
sounded subservient.

16:02.764 --> 16:05.299
No, no, no.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.501
This is the real me.

16:07.802 --> 16:09.203
Do you want me to be her?

16:10.103 --> 16:11.271
No.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.373
Because I can,
if you need that.

16:16.744 --> 16:18.979
I do want to say that I,

16:20.113 --> 16:22.684
I'm completely fine with
you drinking alcohol

16:22.717 --> 16:25.152
and eating dead animals,

16:25.185 --> 16:27.722
and swearing if
you even do that.

16:27.755 --> 16:30.023
Yeah, fuck yeah, I do that.

16:30.057 --> 16:31.291
Yeah, I'm fine with it.

16:31.325 --> 16:33.227
I'm not judgmental.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.295
Well, that's very sweet,

16:35.329 --> 16:37.397
but this is my house

16:37.431 --> 16:39.433
and I really don't
need your permission.

16:39.466 --> 16:41.068
Wait, was I being sexist?

16:41.101 --> 16:41.736
Yes.

16:41.769 --> 16:43.103
I'm sorry.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.539
I identify as a male feminist.

16:44.572 --> 16:45.707
Oh, so a feminist?

16:47.542 --> 16:50.110
I really liked the way
you decorated this place.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.579
Oh, I didn't decorate it.

16:51.613 --> 16:53.615
Cybele did.

16:53.648 --> 16:54.582
Who's Cybele?

16:55.482 --> 16:58.586
She used to live
here and then she died.

16:58.620 --> 17:00.220
Right where you're
standing, actually.

17:00.254 --> 17:01.355
What?

17:01.388 --> 17:02.524
I'm just kidding.

17:02.557 --> 17:03.457
She lives a block away.

17:03.490 --> 17:05.259
Ah, haha.

17:07.829 --> 17:09.196
When I first saw this place,

17:09.229 --> 17:12.199
I was like, whoa,
this is perfect.

17:12.232 --> 17:14.334
I do not need to change a thing.

17:14.368 --> 17:17.437
Yeah, it's a lot of horses.

17:18.372 --> 17:19.172
You think?

17:19.206 --> 17:20.675
No, I mean, I like it.

17:20.708 --> 17:22.276
Yeah, I like it.

17:22.309 --> 17:24.746
I just, I feel like some
people might feel that way.

17:24.779 --> 17:26.814
Oh, well, I love them.

17:28.148 --> 17:30.083
Yeah, did you grow
up around horses?

17:30.117 --> 17:31.553
Never met one.

17:31.586 --> 17:33.588
Just always been drawn to them.

17:33.621 --> 17:35.255
Why do you live here?

17:35.289 --> 17:36.624
What do you mean?

17:36.658 --> 17:38.826
It just, it feels so
far away from everything.

17:38.860 --> 17:41.763
Yeah, well, that's
why I live here.

17:41.796 --> 17:43.831
Yeah, but it must get lonely.

17:43.865 --> 17:47.334
I have this dream that I'm
going to grow old here and

17:47.367 --> 17:48.536
become one of those women

17:48.570 --> 17:50.705
like in a John Wayne
film or something,

17:50.738 --> 17:54.842
like tanned and
leathery and hard.

17:57.645 --> 17:58.746
Do you mind if I clean?

17:58.780 --> 18:00.715
It really relaxes me.

18:00.748 --> 18:01.583
Sure.

18:01.616 --> 18:02.449
Thank you.

18:04.886 --> 18:06.754
1,324 cases last week.

18:07.655 --> 18:09.323
Gonna be 50,000 by March 28th.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.359
Doubling time was seven days.

18:12.392 --> 18:13.595
It's now three.

18:13.628 --> 18:15.329
It's logarithmic, not linear.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.497
That's what everyone's missing.

18:17.532 --> 18:19.132
The death rates
aren't rising yet,

18:19.166 --> 18:22.102
but they're a lagging indicator.

18:32.780 --> 18:34.816
Hey, did you realize
your fan was broken?

18:41.254 --> 18:42.122
Oh.

18:44.191 --> 18:44.826
Hi, ma.

18:44.859 --> 18:46.226
Hey, Ma.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.562
What are you doing at mom's?

18:47.595 --> 18:48.730
The world is
falling apart, little, bro.

18:48.763 --> 18:50.197
Haven't you heard?

18:50.230 --> 18:52.934
Are you quarantining
away from her?

18:52.967 --> 18:54.334
Yeah, sometimes.

18:54.368 --> 18:55.536
Hold on, Asif wants
to say something.

18:55.570 --> 18:57.170
Yo, Ravi, put
our future sister-in-law

18:57.204 --> 18:58.506
on the phone.

18:58.539 --> 18:59.774
- Yeah, no, that's-
- Yo. Put her on the phone!

18:59.807 --> 19:00.775
That's really not
going to work out.

19:00.808 --> 19:01.876
Is she hot?

19:01.909 --> 19:02.877
Uh huh?

19:02.910 --> 19:04.478
Just nod, you
don't have to say it.

19:04.512 --> 19:05.780
I know she's staring
at you right now.

19:05.813 --> 19:07.515
Yeah she's here
for the meeting.

19:07.548 --> 19:08.850
Maybe now you
can actually get laid.

19:08.883 --> 19:10.585
Ravi, laid?

19:10.618 --> 19:11.886
What do we do now?

19:13.420 --> 19:14.856
Do you mean for the next
few months or right now?

19:14.889 --> 19:15.757
Both.

19:17.558 --> 19:18.793
Try doing nothing.

19:18.826 --> 19:20.460
Have you ever done that before?

19:22.930 --> 19:23.865
What do you mean nothing?

19:23.898 --> 19:25.533
I mean, nothing.

19:25.566 --> 19:26.834
Take it from someone
who's unemployed.

19:26.868 --> 19:28.736
The less you do,
the less you do.

19:30.470 --> 19:32.540
The less you do, the
less you do. I like that.

19:32.573 --> 19:33.440
Yeah, I can do that.

19:34.474 --> 19:35.342
Cool.

19:36.978 --> 19:37.845
Yeah.

19:38.780 --> 19:39.881
What time is it?

19:39.914 --> 19:41.683
10:00 AM.

19:41.716 --> 19:42.850
10:00 AM-o.

19:55.930 --> 19:57.665
This is fun.

19:57.699 --> 19:59.667
It's very relaxing.

20:01.502 --> 20:03.805
What song am I thinking of?

20:03.838 --> 20:06.206
I love doing
nothing in silence.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.208
No, me too.

20:09.276 --> 20:10.812
Yeah, this is really relaxing.

20:10.845 --> 20:11.846
Yeah, I have this friend

20:11.879 --> 20:13.648
he reads the books out loud.

20:13.681 --> 20:16.851
And it's like, that's not
what that's meant for.

20:16.884 --> 20:18.285
It's really crazy, you know.

20:18.318 --> 20:19.854
We're just like in this galaxy.

20:39.006 --> 20:39.841
So.

20:41.075 --> 20:42.476
I was going to ask you,

20:42.510 --> 20:45.345
have you been on a lot
of dates on Arranged?

20:45.378 --> 20:46.681
Oh yeah.

20:46.714 --> 20:48.649
Arranged, Shaadi, Vivah,
I'm on all of them.

20:48.683 --> 20:49.884
My mother is desperate.

20:49.917 --> 20:51.719
Wait, you're not?

20:51.753 --> 20:52.587
No.

20:53.521 --> 20:57.658
Do you want to be married?

20:57.692 --> 20:58.860
No, never.

20:58.893 --> 21:00.494
You want to die alone?

21:00.528 --> 21:02.764
It's just someone else
to fight and disappoint

21:02.797 --> 21:03.865
and hate and...

21:03.898 --> 21:06.000
No, it's just exhausting.

21:08.069 --> 21:09.704
Why do you want to get married?

21:11.973 --> 21:14.909
It'd be nice to have
someone to cuddle with.

21:14.942 --> 21:16.343
Yeah, well, you don't
need to be married

21:16.376 --> 21:17.678
to cuddle someone.

21:17.712 --> 21:18.746
I literally do.

21:21.448 --> 21:22.683
I've been meaning to ask,

21:25.452 --> 21:26.821
how do I compare
to the other guys

21:26.854 --> 21:28.022
that you've gone on dates with?

21:28.055 --> 21:31.859
Because I've just been trying
to do this for a year now.

21:31.893 --> 21:34.862
And it just doesn't
seem to work out.

21:34.896 --> 21:36.063
Right, I mean,

21:36.097 --> 21:38.699
well this way of meeting
someone is psychotic.

21:38.733 --> 21:40.835
Well, my parents
spent seven days

21:40.868 --> 21:42.870
before they got married, so.

21:42.904 --> 21:44.505
And how did that work out?

21:44.539 --> 21:45.873
Am I boring?

21:45.907 --> 21:46.741
What?

21:47.775 --> 21:48.609
No.

21:48.643 --> 21:49.476
You hesitated.

21:49.510 --> 21:50.343
I did?

21:50.377 --> 21:51.012
I'm not boring.

21:51.045 --> 21:51.946
I didn't say

21:51.979 --> 21:52.914
- you were boring.
- Okay,

21:52.947 --> 21:54.549
you should see the people

21:54.582 --> 21:57.084
that work in my
research lab, okay.

21:57.118 --> 21:58.686
There's this guy Vivek,

21:58.719 --> 22:00.453
okay, he comes in every morning

22:00.487 --> 22:02.089
and counts the
pennies in his wallet.

22:02.123 --> 22:05.726
And if the number isn't
even he'll skip lunch.

22:06.727 --> 22:08.428
And then there's this girl Juhi.

22:10.131 --> 22:13.400
Juhi insists on telling
you about every single bird

22:13.433 --> 22:14.836
she saw on the way to work.

22:14.869 --> 22:17.038
And I'm like, Juhi, I know
what a pigeon looks like.

22:17.071 --> 22:18.840
Wow, you're really
getting fired up right now.

22:18.873 --> 22:21.709
You know, in college,
I was the fun one.

22:22.677 --> 22:23.511
Really?

22:23.544 --> 22:24.879
Yes.

22:24.912 --> 22:27.748
People ask me all the
time to do impersonations.

22:29.449 --> 22:32.419
Sonam, why don't you
make yourself useful

22:32.452 --> 22:34.922
and go make some
chai for the guests!

22:38.458 --> 22:40.595
Wait, was that supposed
to be a toxic uncle?

22:40.628 --> 22:41.494
Yes.

22:42.630 --> 22:43.463
More.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.765
Okay, okay.

22:46.033 --> 22:50.771
Sonam, did you delete all the
Sex In The City from the DVR?!

22:52.039 --> 22:55.176
That's really good.

22:55.209 --> 22:57.111
Yeah, it's fun, I'm fun.

22:57.144 --> 23:01.749
Sonam, your hips don't lie.

23:01.782 --> 23:02.917
I got to take this.

23:02.950 --> 23:04.886
Some asshole stole my card.

23:04.919 --> 23:06.554
Oh, yup no worries.

23:09.657 --> 23:10.958
Are you sure you can talk?

23:12.059 --> 23:13.561
Yeah, sure, it's fine.

23:14.929 --> 23:16.898
Are you two still fighting?

23:16.931 --> 23:19.700
Actually, no.

23:19.734 --> 23:20.935
So it's getting better?

23:23.237 --> 23:24.171
I
just think, you know,

23:24.205 --> 23:26.040
with everything going on,

23:26.073 --> 23:27.842
we feel lucky or maybe that

23:27.875 --> 23:29.409
we at least have each other.

23:32.113 --> 23:33.981
So do you want
me to stop calling?

23:34.015 --> 23:35.783
No, God, no.

23:35.816 --> 23:36.851
That's not what I'm saying.

23:36.884 --> 23:38.719
It's still a broken marriage.

23:39.687 --> 23:40.554
I miss you.

23:41.656 --> 23:43.157
When can I see you again?

23:43.190 --> 23:44.759
Not for a while.

23:46.227 --> 23:47.094
Of course.

23:52.967 --> 23:54.702
Hey, where are you going?

23:54.735 --> 23:55.603
Heading out.

23:55.636 --> 23:56.469
You can't.

23:57.204 --> 23:58.039
What?

23:58.072 --> 23:59.040
It's shelter in place.

23:59.073 --> 24:00.608
We're allowed to go on walks.

24:00.641 --> 24:02.475
And I think given my
pre-existing condition,

24:02.510 --> 24:03.544
that's not a good idea.

24:03.577 --> 24:04.545
What condition?

24:04.578 --> 24:06.080
Oh, I told you I have asthma.

24:06.113 --> 24:08.616
It sounded like you coughed
once when you were five.

24:08.649 --> 24:10.551
I just, I think
we mutually decided

24:10.584 --> 24:12.687
that it would be safer
if we just stayed in-

24:12.720 --> 24:13.854
- Ugh!

24:20.027 --> 24:21.796
Nothing to fucking watch.

24:24.131 --> 24:25.633
Oh, I don't watch
Hollywood stuff.

24:25.666 --> 24:26.801
I only watch Bollywood.

24:31.639 --> 24:33.240
Hmm, what was that?

24:33.274 --> 24:34.208
What?

24:34.241 --> 24:36.510
Oh, I thought you asked why.

24:36.544 --> 24:37.712
I didn't.

24:37.745 --> 24:38.679
Yeah, our mom
was really worried

24:38.713 --> 24:39.947
that if we watched too
much Hollywood stuff

24:39.981 --> 24:41.115
we would become too white.

24:41.148 --> 24:43.784
So it was all Bollywood
in our household.

24:43.818 --> 24:45.152
Not that I'm complaining.

24:45.186 --> 24:46.587
Which ones have you seen?

24:47.955 --> 24:48.789
No.

24:48.823 --> 24:49.957
What do you mean no?

24:49.991 --> 24:51.759
- Just no.
- Oh, you mean Kal Ho Naa Ho?

24:51.792 --> 24:52.727
No.

24:52.760 --> 24:53.661
Oh, what a masterpiece.

24:53.694 --> 24:55.196
Wait, you haven't seen it?

24:55.229 --> 24:57.131
Oh, you don't want
to sleep on this.

24:57.164 --> 24:58.866
Can I just tell you a
little bit about it quickly?

24:58.899 --> 25:00.034
No.

25:00.067 --> 25:01.736
Basically the movie
starts on char...

25:01.769 --> 25:02.937
Actually no.

25:02.970 --> 25:04.939
It's Preity, Preity is
running to New York.

25:04.972 --> 25:07.008
And she's just, you know,
telling us about her life.

25:07.041 --> 25:10.611
Like, her family's broken
and she's really depressed.

25:10.644 --> 25:12.213
And then you meet
her MBA classmate

25:12.246 --> 25:13.614
being played by Saif.

25:13.647 --> 25:16.317
Honestly, it's one
of his best roles.

25:16.350 --> 25:20.054
He is so stupid and lovable.

25:20.087 --> 25:22.690
And then in walks Shah Rukh.

25:22.723 --> 25:25.760
And he's just like this angel.

25:25.793 --> 25:29.030
And like
these real funny things.

25:29.063 --> 25:30.031
And then right
before intermission,

25:30.064 --> 25:31.665
you find out that the
lady that you thought

25:31.699 --> 25:32.600
was Shah Rukh's wife

25:32.633 --> 25:34.769
is actually his doctor.

25:34.802 --> 25:35.936
Yeah, he's dying.

25:37.104 --> 25:38.739
But then right before he dies,

25:38.773 --> 25:41.809
Priety finds out the
truth about them.

25:41.842 --> 25:44.612
And she runs to New York again.

25:44.645 --> 25:45.980
But this time she's crying.

25:46.947 --> 25:47.915
And she embraces Shah Rukh

25:47.948 --> 25:50.885
and she pieces together
all the beautiful things

25:50.918 --> 25:52.953
that he's done, all
his selfless actions.

25:54.755 --> 25:57.058
And there's a stunning
speech in the end

25:57.091 --> 25:58.926
where they talk about
how you know you've met

25:58.959 --> 26:00.361
the one that you love

26:00.394 --> 26:03.330
when you hear bells
ringing in your heart.

26:03.364 --> 26:06.967
Have you heard bells
when you catch feels?

26:09.103 --> 26:11.138
That's not what love is like.

26:13.107 --> 26:14.041
Oh yeah, I know.

26:15.943 --> 26:17.745
Yeah I know.

26:17.778 --> 26:18.646
Oh!

26:22.850 --> 26:25.986
If we go down this path,
there's no going back.

26:27.221 --> 26:28.089
Mhmm.

26:29.757 --> 26:31.192
Okay.

26:31.225 --> 26:33.260
Well, I'll show you
my underwear options.

26:35.096 --> 26:35.963
Right.

26:48.809 --> 26:50.144
This isn't so bad.

26:51.445 --> 26:53.013
Yeah, I guess.

26:53.047 --> 26:56.117
Yeah, I mean, we can do
this for two more days.

26:56.150 --> 26:57.017
Sure.

26:58.152 --> 27:00.788
It's like, it
doesn't not work.

27:01.689 --> 27:02.356
I guess.

27:10.998 --> 27:12.700
I'm feeling happy.

27:12.733 --> 27:13.868
Really?

27:13.901 --> 27:15.402
I just feel...

27:18.239 --> 27:19.106
Whiskey?

27:21.442 --> 27:22.910
Oh, what?

27:23.944 --> 27:24.979
You feel whiskey.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.015
Because I spiked your drink.

27:29.216 --> 27:32.753
Are you joking?

27:32.786 --> 27:33.622
No.

27:35.022 --> 27:36.457
Why would you do that?

27:36.490 --> 27:38.292
Because I'm bored.

27:38.325 --> 27:39.860
And I thought it'd be funny.

27:40.961 --> 27:42.062
There's alcohol in...

27:46.767 --> 27:47.434
Well.

27:48.903 --> 27:49.937
That's the shit.

27:54.041 --> 27:55.976
It's the shit, man.

27:56.010 --> 27:57.444
You know what
else is the shit?

27:57.478 --> 27:58.846
What?

27:58.879 --> 28:00.281
Research.

28:01.916 --> 28:03.184
Research is the shit.

28:03.217 --> 28:04.818
I agree.

28:04.852 --> 28:06.187
You know what I love?

28:06.220 --> 28:08.489
Chi statistical tests.

28:08.523 --> 28:10.791
Don't even get
me started on Chi.

28:10.824 --> 28:13.227
I'm so glad there's a

28:14.962 --> 28:17.898
attractive female who I
can talk to about this.

28:17.932 --> 28:20.301
- Oh, I'm your girl.
- Get your friends dewy.

28:22.002 --> 28:24.038
You know what's always
bugged me is like,

28:24.071 --> 28:27.474
why is the P value of 0.05

28:27.509 --> 28:30.911
the threshold of certainty?

28:30.945 --> 28:32.479
Amen, I've always
thought this.

28:34.348 --> 28:36.116
Don't eat that.

28:36.150 --> 28:37.017
Ugh.

28:38.352 --> 28:40.054
That's shit.

28:40.087 --> 28:41.355
Not the shit.

28:41.388 --> 28:42.823
Mhmm.

28:42.856 --> 28:43.924
You know what
else is the shit?

28:43.958 --> 28:44.825
What?

28:46.827 --> 28:47.494
Standup.

28:48.429 --> 28:50.297
Standup is the shit.

28:50.331 --> 28:51.966
I love stand up.

28:51.999 --> 28:53.767
Have you ever done stand up?

28:54.536 --> 28:57.071
No.

28:58.872 --> 29:01.108
No!

29:02.409 --> 29:05.379
I mean, you could
do stand up for me right now.

29:05.412 --> 29:09.116
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

29:09.149 --> 29:09.984
Mm-mm.

29:10.017 --> 29:10.951
Okay, okay.

29:10.985 --> 29:11.986
- If you don't want to.
- I'm not going to do,

29:12.019 --> 29:12.419
let's do stand up.

29:18.225 --> 29:21.895
Hey guys, it's me, Ravi Sharma.

29:22.564 --> 29:24.932
Really excited.

29:24.965 --> 29:27.468
I've been dreaming about
this moment for a long time.

29:28.603 --> 29:31.238
Got the best fans in the
world, love you guys.

29:33.107 --> 29:37.845
I shit myself

29:37.878 --> 29:40.347
before I got on stage,

29:40.381 --> 29:41.782
So you're welcome.

29:45.286 --> 29:46.153
What else?

29:47.622 --> 29:52.826
Oh, in high school they used
to call me chicken shwarma

29:55.062 --> 29:57.565
when it doesn't even make any
sense 'cause I don't eat meat.

29:57.599 --> 30:01.869
And it's Sharma, not shwarma.

30:10.110 --> 30:12.212
Oh, don't worry,
this is diet Coke.

30:15.916 --> 30:18.419
I'm the youngest
of three brothers,

30:18.452 --> 30:21.322
but I'm closest to my mom.

30:21.355 --> 30:22.557
Oh my mom's
divorced, by the way.

30:22.590 --> 30:24.058
Can I get a what what?

30:26.561 --> 30:29.330
Yeah, she's divorced
and divorce sucks, man.

30:29.363 --> 30:31.332
You know, it really sucks.

30:31.365 --> 30:34.435
And it specially sucks
when you're Indian,

30:34.468 --> 30:37.438
because you can't talk about it.

30:39.907 --> 30:40.908
You can't talk about that.

30:42.476 --> 30:43.877
And you know, like you
go to functions and stuff

30:43.911 --> 30:46.514
and they just pretend
like it didn't happen.

30:46.548 --> 30:48.248
You know what it's like,
it's like Game of Thrones.

30:48.282 --> 30:50.117
You guys know Game
of Thrones, right?

30:51.452 --> 30:53.621
So like in Game of Thrones,
they killed Jon Snow.

30:53.655 --> 30:57.124
And then he just like
came back to life.

30:57.157 --> 30:58.192
And it's like,

30:59.159 --> 31:01.895
are we going to talk
about that, you know?

31:03.297 --> 31:04.164
Hmm.

31:05.265 --> 31:06.433
Yeah, divorce sucks,

31:06.467 --> 31:09.870
but you know what's even
worse than divorce is

31:10.638 --> 31:12.607
being lonely.

31:13.974 --> 31:16.076
Ugh, it feels so much worse.

31:16.110 --> 31:20.381
Like, like I'd much rather
got married and then like try

31:20.414 --> 31:23.417
and try and try and try,
and then it not work out

31:23.450 --> 31:26.086
than be lonely.

31:26.120 --> 31:30.124
I mean, that's like the
real threshold of certainty.

31:30.157 --> 31:33.193
But you know, just
don't get divorced.

31:33.227 --> 31:34.461
Don't be lonely.

31:36.564 --> 31:38.432
And there's fucking
shit everywhere.

31:52.112 --> 31:53.180
Come on, let's dance.

31:54.314 --> 31:55.650
Come on, come on.

31:57.217 --> 32:01.121
I've spent my whole life
not dancing, come on.

32:07.494 --> 32:08.362
Okay.

34:07.481 --> 34:09.182
I said I'm sorry.

34:11.786 --> 34:13.821
It's 323 dots yesterday.

34:13.855 --> 34:14.789
In this county.

34:15.823 --> 34:18.726
That's numbers rising,
just steadily rising.

34:18.760 --> 34:20.762
You know, like I said,
it's logarithmic.

34:22.329 --> 34:26.099
Everyone tries to drink
at least once in their life.

34:26.133 --> 34:27.467
What are you going
to do next, huh?

34:27.502 --> 34:30.538
You're going to put some
crystal meth in my ice tea,

34:30.572 --> 34:33.708
some heroin in my mouthwash?

34:33.741 --> 34:35.142
Oh, you're exhausting.

34:35.175 --> 34:36.578
My head really hurts.

34:45.385 --> 34:47.187
What
is up, my loves?

34:47.220 --> 34:49.657
We are here, we are ready,
we're going to shine.

34:49.691 --> 34:51.224
Today we are gonna
be using free weights

34:51.258 --> 34:53.628
but if you don't have them,
you can use cans of soup

34:53.661 --> 34:54.762
or your cat, whatever.

34:54.796 --> 34:56.496
Okay, we're gonna
start with hand across.

34:56.531 --> 34:57.632
Okay.

34:57.665 --> 34:58.833
Here we go.

34:58.866 --> 35:01.468
Okay, breathe the music.

35:01.502 --> 35:02.637
You got this, 60 seconds.

35:02.670 --> 35:03.805
We can do anything
for 60 seconds.

35:03.838 --> 35:06.674
Oh my God, wait,
you are unstoppable.

35:06.708 --> 35:08.475
Okay, these things are burning.

35:08.509 --> 35:09.611
We burn for strength.

35:09.644 --> 35:12.479
Yes, feel the burn,
love the burn.

35:12.513 --> 35:13.848
Okay, 15 seconds.

35:13.881 --> 35:15.482
Go and drink in the
pop, don't be scared.

35:15.516 --> 35:19.621
Five, four, three, two, one.

35:19.654 --> 35:21.221
Last, chest up.

35:21.254 --> 35:23.190
I want you guys to hinge
at the waist and push back.

35:23.223 --> 35:25.225
I want your titties to
just like hang free.

35:25.258 --> 35:27.762
Whether you are an
A cup or a double G

35:27.795 --> 35:29.631
your titties are powerful.

35:29.664 --> 35:30.865
Love your body.

35:30.898 --> 35:33.367
Look at all you beautiful goals.

35:33.400 --> 35:34.736
Squeeze your tush

35:34.769 --> 35:35.670
like the water keeps oozing.

35:35.703 --> 35:38.305
That's right, four, three, two,

35:39.206 --> 35:40.908
oh, make it burn.

35:40.942 --> 35:42.142
One, oh yes.

35:43.544 --> 35:44.912
As always you can
find me on Instagram,

35:44.946 --> 35:46.246
Twitter or my Tiktok.

35:46.279 --> 35:48.750
See you until next time.

35:54.254 --> 35:55.590
Whoo.

36:03.230 --> 36:05.700
What, you're not
going to answer that?

36:05.733 --> 36:06.801
I don't want to.

36:06.834 --> 36:08.703
But that's your mom.

36:12.674 --> 36:14.509
Why
didn't you answer before?

36:14.542 --> 36:15.977
I was busy.

36:16.010 --> 36:18.278
I
called three times.

36:18.311 --> 36:19.614
I'm sorry.

36:19.647 --> 36:22.449
So busy
doing no job, getting older.

36:23.885 --> 36:26.554
I haven't heard from
his parents yet.

36:26.587 --> 36:28.623
Must not have gone well.

36:28.656 --> 36:31.224
Told you
it went well, mom.

36:31.258 --> 36:33.728
I hope you
didn't show him the real you.

36:34.829 --> 36:36.430
I didn't.

36:36.463 --> 36:38.966
He
can't love that you.

36:39.000 --> 36:40.568
You will thank me one day.

36:41.569 --> 36:42.603
I know, Mom.

37:00.988 --> 37:02.355
You like pasta?

37:02.389 --> 37:04.357
I've been known to
eat a pound or two.

37:05.325 --> 37:06.861
You want to help me cook?

37:06.894 --> 37:07.762
I can't.

37:08.830 --> 37:09.731
I can teach you.

37:09.764 --> 37:11.766
My mother tried that already.

37:11.799 --> 37:12.900
Come on.

37:12.934 --> 37:14.602
I'm really bad at it.

37:14.635 --> 37:15.970
Yeah, I don't believe that.

37:18.506 --> 37:19.372
Want me to try?

37:20.474 --> 37:21.341
Sure.

37:28.783 --> 37:29.717
It's a good start.

37:30.785 --> 37:32.252
Stove's under here.

37:35.422 --> 37:37.357
Do you know what
a stove looks like?

37:38.526 --> 37:40.728
Yeah, yeah that's a stove.

37:45.066 --> 37:45.933
Okay.

37:47.635 --> 37:49.670
Okay, we can work with this.

37:51.639 --> 37:54.909
Ooh.

37:58.378 --> 38:00.648
Hey, did you hear about
that guy in Argentina?

38:00.681 --> 38:01.849
No.

38:01.883 --> 38:03.551
He set out on
a four month sail

38:03.584 --> 38:05.720
in December before COVID.

38:05.753 --> 38:08.956
No cell, no internet,
no way of reaching him.

38:08.990 --> 38:11.324
He's just like an ocean cowboy.

38:12.960 --> 38:13.895
You know, he's just floating out

38:13.928 --> 38:15.797
in the middle of the Atlantic,

38:15.830 --> 38:17.965
has no idea that the
world has changed.

38:19.066 --> 38:21.368
He's the last innocent
man in the world.

38:21.401 --> 38:22.335
Sounds like a,

38:22.369 --> 38:23.671
- Dream.
- Nightmare.

38:26.574 --> 38:27.508
That's good.

38:27.542 --> 38:28.810
And now he's
going to be coming back

38:28.843 --> 38:29.977
to all of this.

38:33.413 --> 38:35.448
It's like stepping
through a wormhole.

38:35.482 --> 38:36.517
He'll adapt.

38:37.785 --> 38:38.653
Maybe.

38:42.590 --> 38:43.658
With that one?

38:43.691 --> 38:45.458
- Yeah, that one.
- Okay.

38:50.665 --> 38:52.133
So what do we do now?

38:52.166 --> 38:53.034
We just wait.

38:56.737 --> 38:57.939
That was a lot of work.

38:58.840 --> 38:59.707
Moment of truth.

39:03.845 --> 39:05.345
Oh my God, that is so good.

39:06.013 --> 39:07.648
Mmm.

39:07.682 --> 39:08.950
- Mhmm.
- Right?

39:08.983 --> 39:09.851
Mhmm.

39:10.918 --> 39:12.720
- No.
- You like it, right?

39:12.753 --> 39:15.323
Yeah, it's really
good, really good, mhmm.

39:16.157 --> 39:17.525
Wow.

39:17.558 --> 39:19.426
This is amazing, fuck takeout.

39:19.459 --> 39:21.028
I'm going to cook
every meal, I'm a chef.

39:21.062 --> 39:24.765
Mm, it's so filling I almost
feel like I'm already full.

39:27.001 --> 39:27.869
Yes.

39:34.175 --> 39:36.577
Everything on here is trash.

39:36.611 --> 39:37.879
Mmm.

39:37.912 --> 39:39.547
I guess we have no choice.

39:40.681 --> 39:41.716
What do you want
to watch tonight?

39:42.984 --> 39:45.485
Actually, I can double
check on my calendar,

39:45.519 --> 39:49.422
but I'm pretty sure I'm booked
up tonight, unfortunately.

39:49.456 --> 39:50.992
Oh, you...

39:51.025 --> 39:53.426
you've made plans or something?

39:53.460 --> 39:54.095
Yeah.

39:56.030 --> 39:56.864
Okay.

39:58.099 --> 40:00.034
I wouldn't do this
if you feel weird.

40:00.067 --> 40:01.434
Why would I feel weird?

40:01.468 --> 40:02.169
I don't know.

40:03.170 --> 40:04.171
What's your mom saying now?

40:04.205 --> 40:05.673
Keep the train moving.

40:07.108 --> 40:08.509
I'll coach you.

40:08.542 --> 40:10.211
Like Shah Rukh with Saif?

40:10.244 --> 40:12.513
Sure, like that.

40:12.546 --> 40:13.915
Oh, I can't go on a
date in front of you.

40:13.948 --> 40:15.549
Please, I'm so bored.

40:15.583 --> 40:16.817
We have history.

40:16.851 --> 40:18.085
We met yesterday.

40:18.119 --> 40:19.820
Can I have some
more concealer?

40:22.556 --> 40:24.491
I won't say anything,
I'll be off screen.

40:24.525 --> 40:27.128
I'll just text
suggestions, okay?

40:34.268 --> 40:35.102
Hi!

40:35.136 --> 40:36.804
Hi, Pallavi, it's Ravi.

40:36.837 --> 40:38.906
Nice to e-meet you.

40:42.209 --> 40:43.844
I'm good, and you?

40:46.280 --> 40:47.848
Do an impersonation.

40:51.819 --> 40:56.791
Wow, that's a
really good Barack Obama.

40:58.125 --> 41:00.094
I can actually do a
misogynistic Indian uncle.

41:00.127 --> 41:03.831
Okay, you want to
see?

41:03.864 --> 41:05.032
Sonam?

41:05.066 --> 41:07.068
Did you use all
the toilet paper?

41:07.101 --> 41:10.938
All the TP?!

41:10.972 --> 41:12.974
Wow, you have an amazing laugh.

41:14.008 --> 41:16.143
I want three kids, is that okay?

41:18.012 --> 41:20.848
Yes, I would love to hear the
names you have picked out.

41:24.318 --> 41:26.020
Your smile is amazing.

41:28.990 --> 41:32.760
I have to say you're-

41:35.129 --> 41:36.797
Uh huh, sorry, say that again?

41:39.233 --> 41:40.735
Hey.

41:40.768 --> 41:42.870
Oh, she's super sweet.

41:42.903 --> 41:44.238
She works in medicine,

41:44.271 --> 41:47.008
but she loves baking
and rose gardens.

41:47.041 --> 41:49.577
Wow, so fun.

41:49.610 --> 41:50.244
Yeah.

41:50.277 --> 41:53.147
Is she traditional?

41:53.180 --> 41:55.649
She really, really is.

41:55.683 --> 41:57.818
I brought up the kids,
she was totally on board.

41:57.852 --> 41:59.053
Brought up living with my mom,

41:59.086 --> 42:01.522
she said she would not
want it any other way.

42:02.857 --> 42:04.058
Yeah.

42:04.091 --> 42:07.161
She also said that she only
eats Western food on Sundays,

42:07.194 --> 42:08.896
but she wants Indian
Monday through Saturday.

42:08.929 --> 42:11.999
And I was like,
that is fine by me.

42:12.033 --> 42:13.167
You know what I mean?

42:13.200 --> 42:14.268
If I never eat a
veggie burger again,

42:14.301 --> 42:15.803
I'll be great.

42:15.836 --> 42:17.571
Wow, she sounds perfect.

42:17.605 --> 42:19.673
She, yeah, I don't, you know,

42:19.707 --> 42:20.875
I don't want to get
too ahead of myself,

42:20.908 --> 42:22.710
but I can definitely see
us getting to at least

42:22.743 --> 42:24.311
the engagement line.

42:24.345 --> 42:27.681
And then, you know, we'll see.

42:27.715 --> 42:28.582
Are you okay?

42:29.683 --> 42:30.551
I'm great.

42:35.689 --> 42:36.323
What are you doing?

42:36.357 --> 42:37.725
Oh, sorry.

42:37.758 --> 42:39.293
Whenever I feel a
rush of happiness

42:39.326 --> 42:40.728
I get terrified
that the happiness

42:40.761 --> 42:41.896
will be taken away from me.

42:41.929 --> 42:43.230
So just to distract myself.

42:53.107 --> 42:54.008
Do you paint?

42:55.843 --> 42:56.944
Yeah.

42:56.977 --> 42:59.080
Oh, wow, I had no idea.

42:59.113 --> 43:00.347
- Show me!
- No.

43:01.649 --> 43:02.316
Why?

43:03.651 --> 43:05.953
It's not
your kind of thing.

43:05.986 --> 43:07.655
How do you know?

43:07.688 --> 43:10.391
Because it's vaginas.

43:10.424 --> 43:14.095
Like not the nice kind,
like menacing vaginas.

43:14.128 --> 43:18.966
Blood gushing, barbed
wire, steel traps.

43:18.999 --> 43:22.369
Just aggressive,
vaginal imagery.

43:25.339 --> 43:26.240
Do you like that?

43:27.741 --> 43:28.609
Mhmm.

43:33.047 --> 43:34.248
Rita?

43:34.281 --> 43:35.983
Hey.

43:36.016 --> 43:38.719
It's
like two in the morning.

43:38.752 --> 43:39.920
I know.

43:39.954 --> 43:41.956
You can't...

43:41.989 --> 43:43.124
You can't just call.

43:43.157 --> 43:44.291
I know.

43:44.325 --> 43:46.327
Did you text first?

43:46.360 --> 43:47.695
No.

43:47.728 --> 43:48.662
Well,
that's the system.

43:48.696 --> 43:51.232
So please don't do that.

43:52.099 --> 43:53.701
Okay, I'm sorry.

44:17.191 --> 44:18.058
Rita?

44:19.360 --> 44:20.327
I couldn't sleep.

44:25.099 --> 44:27.201
So you put on a lehenga?

44:27.234 --> 44:28.903
Thought you'd like it.

44:28.936 --> 44:30.738
Have you
worn it before?

44:30.771 --> 44:32.439
Patel uncle's
Holiday Inn opening.

44:33.474 --> 44:35.176
It's beautiful.

44:35.209 --> 44:37.778
It's made by child labor.

44:37.811 --> 44:38.712
Is this a dream?

44:40.014 --> 44:42.016
It's your fantasy, Ravi.

44:42.049 --> 44:43.284
You're being
so inappropriate.

44:43.317 --> 44:44.785
I know.

44:47.154 --> 44:48.789
Can I make you some daal?

44:51.892 --> 44:53.093
Daal makes me gassy.

44:57.398 --> 44:58.265
Did you fart?

45:00.000 --> 45:01.503
Have we heard
back from Pallavi?

45:01.536 --> 45:03.103
No.

45:03.137 --> 45:05.072
Okay, do you want
to call her father tomorrow?

45:05.105 --> 45:06.473
It's been 12 hours.

45:06.508 --> 45:08.142
Okay, thanks, mom.

45:08.175 --> 45:09.343
What about Serena
from last week?

45:09.376 --> 45:10.444
Her
family is checking

45:10.477 --> 45:11.812
with their astrologer.

45:11.845 --> 45:13.480
Yeah, we should
follow up with them.

45:13.515 --> 45:15.049
Definitely.

45:15.082 --> 45:16.217
Yeah you know, just
really stay on top of it.

45:16.250 --> 45:17.384
I'll make a note.

45:17.418 --> 45:19.153
I'm
monitoring it closely.

45:19.186 --> 45:20.754
Yeah.

45:20.788 --> 45:22.089
I mean it's okay if it's a
pass, we just have to know.

45:22.122 --> 45:24.225
What
about that other girl?

45:24.258 --> 45:25.859
What's her name, Tanu?

45:25.893 --> 45:28.162
Yeah no, Tanu was
the one with the lazy eye.

45:28.195 --> 45:30.431
Oh but she
has such a pretty mouth.

45:46.548 --> 45:48.282
Okay, Rita,
I just told you not to call.

45:48.315 --> 45:50.050
- I'm coming over right now.
- What?

45:50.084 --> 45:51.986
- No, Beth is here.
- I know.

45:52.019 --> 45:52.987
Are you crazy?

45:53.020 --> 45:54.188
I need to see you.

45:54.221 --> 45:55.990
You can see
me when we're not in the middle

45:56.023 --> 45:58.425
of a pandemic and I'm not
quarantined with my wife.

45:58.459 --> 45:59.426
Why don't I talk to Beth?

45:59.460 --> 46:01.095
Are you serious?

46:05.466 --> 46:06.568
What are you doing?

46:06.601 --> 46:08.202
Oh, it's this
thing that's trending

46:08.235 --> 46:09.870
where everyone's making
noise at the same time

46:09.903 --> 46:12.239
to thank the healthcare workers.

46:12.273 --> 46:14.174
Aren't the doctors
in the hospital?

46:14.208 --> 46:15.543
Some of them are at home.

46:15.577 --> 46:17.244
You think doctors live
in this neighborhood?

46:17.278 --> 46:19.480
It's not just for doctors,
it's also for nurses.

46:19.514 --> 46:22.483
It's you know, really about
solidarity and connection.

46:22.517 --> 46:24.251
We're banging pots and
pans for each other

46:24.285 --> 46:25.986
to remind ourselves
that we're still here

46:26.020 --> 46:27.921
and that we can still
hear each other.

46:29.023 --> 46:30.491
Should I start?

46:32.926 --> 46:35.296
Thank you!

46:35.329 --> 46:36.797
You're the real Avengers!

46:37.898 --> 46:38.533
Rita?

46:38.566 --> 46:39.900
I'll be back.

46:39.933 --> 46:40.568
You're not even
wearing a mask.

46:40.602 --> 46:41.435
I don't care.

46:41.468 --> 46:42.403
People are dying.

46:42.436 --> 46:43.337
I don't care.

46:43.370 --> 46:44.506
I don't care, I don't care!

46:46.874 --> 46:48.175
It's our last day together.

46:48.208 --> 46:50.010
You can't control me.

46:50.044 --> 46:50.978
I'm not
trying to control-

46:51.011 --> 46:52.580
- You think you can
make everything happen

46:52.614 --> 46:53.914
exactly the way you want it to

46:53.947 --> 46:55.316
at exactly the time you want.

46:55.349 --> 46:57.017
Guess what?

46:57.051 --> 46:58.085
You're not going to meet someone

46:58.118 --> 46:59.320
seven days before your wedding,

46:59.353 --> 47:01.121
hear a bunch of clanging
bells in your heart

47:01.155 --> 47:02.189
and fall in love!

47:03.290 --> 47:05.292
Sometimes there
are no bells, Ravi.

47:05.326 --> 47:07.227
Sometimes it's just
deafening silence.

48:56.704 --> 48:58.338
Deja vu.

48:58.372 --> 48:59.239
Yeah.

49:04.077 --> 49:06.046
- Did you call to confirm?
- Yeah.

49:06.079 --> 49:07.347
I'm actually running late,

49:07.381 --> 49:10.552
but I wanted to wait
for you to wake up so

49:10.585 --> 49:13.621
I could say goodbye
before I left.

49:13.655 --> 49:15.088
Thanks.

49:15.122 --> 49:15.989
Yeah.

49:19.059 --> 49:20.628
It was really nice getting to...

49:31.606 --> 49:33.140
Ravi?

49:33.173 --> 49:34.041
Yeah?

49:36.210 --> 49:38.212
I'm really sorry
for what I said.

49:38.245 --> 49:39.112
It's okay.

49:56.163 --> 49:57.498
What was that?

49:57.532 --> 49:58.633
Nothing.

49:58.666 --> 49:59.801
- You just coughed.
- No I didn't.

49:59.834 --> 50:01.168
No, I heard you.

50:01.201 --> 50:02.336
No, I was just
clearing my throat.

50:02.369 --> 50:06.708
You just coughed.

50:06.741 --> 50:09.243
I don't have a temperature,
you've checked twice already.

50:09.276 --> 50:11.245
Hi, yes, I'd like
to cancel my rental.

50:11.278 --> 50:12.446
- Sir, there is
- Why would you

50:12.479 --> 50:13.648
- cancel your rental?
- A cancellation fee.

50:13.681 --> 50:15.517
No, yeah, I'll pay the fee.

50:15.550 --> 50:16.618
Ravi, seriously.

50:19.687 --> 50:20.822
I'll bring you all your meals,

50:20.855 --> 50:22.790
but we can't be in
the same room anymore.

50:22.824 --> 50:27.294
Well, I love being alone,
so that's fine.

50:28.495 --> 50:29.797
How are you going to get back?

50:29.831 --> 50:31.666
I'm not
worried about that.

50:33.768 --> 50:35.637
I don't need a nurse, Ravi.

50:35.670 --> 50:36.538
I know.

51:36.731 --> 51:37.865
Hey, Ravi?

51:39.232 --> 51:40.602
Yes?

51:40.635 --> 51:43.470
Could you get me
something from the bathroom?

51:43.504 --> 51:44.471
Of course.

51:44.505 --> 51:45.339
Great.

51:49.844 --> 51:51.411
What do you need, Rita?

51:51.445 --> 51:55.449
So it's on the sink, it's
next to the moisturizer.

51:56.383 --> 51:58.452
It's purple.

51:59.386 --> 52:00.487
Purple.

52:01.689 --> 52:06.193
Yeah, and it's kind
of cylindrical and it vibrates.

52:06.928 --> 52:08.896
Jesus, Rita.

52:19.406 --> 52:20.440
Hi, Ma.

52:20.474 --> 52:21.643
I'm sorry, betta.

52:22.543 --> 52:23.945
She passed on me?

52:23.978 --> 52:25.780
Yes.

52:25.813 --> 52:27.214
No worries.

52:27.247 --> 52:28.181
Betta, it's not you.

52:28.215 --> 52:30.551
Her mom said she is
focused on her career.

52:30.585 --> 52:31.653
I'm getting a work call.

52:31.686 --> 52:32.553
Betta.

52:36.824 --> 52:38.358
Well, fuck Pallavi.

52:38.392 --> 52:39.927
She was a loser anyway.

52:39.961 --> 52:41.696
She went to Harvard
Medical School.

52:41.729 --> 52:43.865
No shit, get it Pallavi.

52:43.898 --> 52:45.332
Yeah, you messed up, dude.

52:54.408 --> 52:55.275
Who's there?

52:55.308 --> 52:56.544
Spell.

52:56.577 --> 52:57.745
Spell who?

52:57.779 --> 52:59.714
W-H-O.

52:59.747 --> 53:01.649
That was the worst one yet.

53:01.683 --> 53:03.183
I can't do this anymore.

53:07.320 --> 53:08.656
Is that you?

53:08.690 --> 53:10.457
Yeah, I had my hair
permanently straightened

53:10.490 --> 53:12.426
because everyone said
it looked like pubes.

53:12.459 --> 53:13.828
Oh, I love your hair.

53:13.861 --> 53:15.429
You do?

53:16.631 --> 53:18.298
No, they just
keep getting worse.

53:18.331 --> 53:19.366
I can't do this.

53:22.335 --> 53:23.303
Who's there?

53:23.336 --> 53:24.204
Yeah.

53:24.939 --> 53:26.273
Yeah who?

53:26.306 --> 53:27.875
No thanks,
I prefer Google.

53:27.909 --> 53:29.443
Oh, please stop.

53:35.750 --> 53:36.984
Just sent you one.

53:37.018 --> 53:38.686
Is this prom?

53:38.720 --> 53:39.854
Yeah.

53:39.887 --> 53:42.557
That's me and Shane
Wright, my date.

53:43.490 --> 53:44.726
Best kiss I've ever had.

53:47.862 --> 53:49.463
When was your first kiss?

53:49.496 --> 53:51.733
Rita, are
we really doing this?

53:51.766 --> 53:52.834
Wait, have you?

53:52.867 --> 53:53.701
What?

53:53.735 --> 53:54.602
Kissed someone.

53:54.635 --> 53:55.803
Yes, yes!

53:55.837 --> 53:57.004
I'm not that sheltered.

53:57.038 --> 53:59.006
I kissed someone
in college, okay?

53:59.040 --> 54:00.208
Who?

54:00.240 --> 54:02.777
Rita, I'm not going to tell
you about Becky right now.

54:02.810 --> 54:03.678
Becky?

54:05.046 --> 54:06.681
It was at a party.

54:06.714 --> 54:08.683
I was walking up the stairs
to go to the bathroom

54:08.716 --> 54:13.721
and she got in there, you know,
literally and into my mouth.

54:15.056 --> 54:16.023
Whoa.

54:17.825 --> 54:20.360
Anyways, then I shoved
my tongue back into her

54:21.662 --> 54:24.732
and I tried to do the same, you
know, hardness that she did.

54:24.766 --> 54:25.967
And I think she liked it.

54:26.868 --> 54:29.637
And yeah, we had touchdown.

54:40.081 --> 54:41.381
It's like siblings.

54:41.414 --> 54:42.617
It's nothing like siblings.

54:42.650 --> 54:44.552
- Hold on.
- Do you fuck your siblings?

54:44.585 --> 54:47.522
You have to love your brother
regardless of who he is.

54:47.555 --> 54:48.488
I don't have a brother.

54:48.523 --> 54:50.457
Yeah but if you had
one, you'd love him.

54:50.490 --> 54:52.927
And if you arranged to a man,
you'd love him the same way,

54:52.960 --> 54:54.562
because you had to.

54:54.595 --> 54:56.063
It's a kick in the chest.

54:56.097 --> 54:57.430
What do you mean?

54:57.464 --> 54:58.599
Love.

54:58.633 --> 55:00.768
It's not something
you grow like a plant.

55:00.802 --> 55:02.670
You can't just go from
being complete strangers

55:02.703 --> 55:04.005
to living together.

55:04.038 --> 55:04.906
We did.

55:06.841 --> 55:08.776
You sound short of breath.

55:08.810 --> 55:09.877
You're being paranoid.

55:09.911 --> 55:10.878
Go eat some dinner.

55:10.912 --> 55:11.946
I'm not hungry.

55:14.682 --> 55:16.784
You know, I used
to be like you.

55:17.919 --> 55:20.320
I didn't drink, I
didn't eat meat.

55:21.088 --> 55:22.623
Then you know what happened

55:22.657 --> 55:24.926
when I started doing just
whatever I wanted to?

55:26.493 --> 55:27.728
What?

55:27.762 --> 55:29.730
I had better orgasms.

55:31.699 --> 55:32.567
Rita.

55:34.635 --> 55:36.137
You're
uncomfortable because I said

55:36.170 --> 55:37.470
the word orgasm.

55:39.907 --> 55:40.775
Ravi?

55:42.877 --> 55:44.444
Obviously you jack off.

55:44.477 --> 55:46.881
I mean, you probably watch
all kinds of sick porn.

55:47.815 --> 55:49.617
The door is closed.

55:49.650 --> 55:50.751
You can't see me.

55:51.752 --> 55:54.822
Just say something real, please.

55:58.759 --> 55:59.894
You're so repressed.

56:01.028 --> 56:03.097
It's like every morning
when you take a dump,

56:03.130 --> 56:04.966
you play music in the bathroom.

56:04.999 --> 56:06.968
Like I'll never guess
what's going on.

56:07.001 --> 56:08.569
Should we talk about Daddy?

56:09.804 --> 56:10.838
- What?
- Nevermind.

56:14.609 --> 56:16.744
I don't know what you
think that you overheard.

56:16.777 --> 56:18.646
"I want your cock."

56:26.187 --> 56:27.788
Is he nice to you, Rita?

56:29.590 --> 56:30.791
Because you deserve that.

56:37.531 --> 56:40.034
We met at a gallery.

56:40.067 --> 56:41.535
He knows a lot about art.

56:45.806 --> 56:49.911
I started the
whole thing because

56:49.944 --> 56:51.012
I wanted to,

56:53.180 --> 56:55.750
because it was impossible.

57:01.923 --> 57:03.157
What are you doing?

57:04.859 --> 57:06.493
Nothing.

57:06.527 --> 57:09.163
Have you spoken to
your mom since you got sick?

57:10.765 --> 57:12.499
None of your business.

57:12.533 --> 57:15.069
Try to avoid avoidance.

57:16.070 --> 57:17.705
I'm not avoiding anything.

57:19.073 --> 57:20.708
You live in a museum.

57:21.842 --> 57:23.210
No, I don't.

57:23.244 --> 57:25.980
You should
make the first move,

57:26.013 --> 57:28.716
then think about having
realistic expectation.

57:30.952 --> 57:33.654
Why do you sound
like a self-help robot?

57:33.688 --> 57:36.090
I just want to
help you be happy like me.

57:37.591 --> 57:38.960
Are you happy?

57:38.993 --> 57:40.161
I'm very happy.

57:40.194 --> 57:42.229
You're very lonely.

57:42.263 --> 57:46.000
It's honestly a little pathetic
to need someone that much.

57:49.003 --> 57:50.705
What, you're allowed
to probe me endlessly,

57:50.738 --> 57:53.007
but not vice versa?

57:58.746 --> 57:59.981
Ravi?

58:00.014 --> 58:00.881
Yeah?

58:02.049 --> 58:03.851
Just checking
you're still there.

58:04.752 --> 58:05.686
I'm still here.

1:00:53.387 --> 1:00:54.221
Rita?

1:00:56.190 --> 1:00:57.057
What?

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:00.961
I think we have
to call an ambulance.

1:01:03.297 --> 1:01:04.165
Rita.

1:01:08.802 --> 1:01:10.237
What if I never come back?

1:01:12.106 --> 1:01:12.973
Come on.

1:01:14.175 --> 1:01:15.409
You're going to come back.

1:01:36.263 --> 1:01:37.398
Rita?

1:01:37.431 --> 1:01:38.966
Ravi, it's
been 30 minutes.

1:01:38.999 --> 1:01:40.434
Are they still admitting you?

1:01:41.536 --> 1:01:43.103
I'll call
you when I know more.

1:01:43.137 --> 1:01:44.004
Bye.

1:01:55.316 --> 1:01:57.017
- Hello?
- Hi there.

1:01:57.051 --> 1:01:58.385
Is this Ravi Shwarma?

1:01:58.419 --> 1:01:59.920
Yes.

1:01:59.954 --> 1:02:01.855
Am I
pronouncing that correctly?

1:02:01.889 --> 1:02:03.224
Yes.

1:02:03.257 --> 1:02:03.958
Hi, I'm
calling from the hospital.

1:02:03.991 --> 1:02:04.825
It's Dr. Henry.

1:02:04.858 --> 1:02:05.926
Is this about Rita?

1:02:05.960 --> 1:02:06.961
Yes.

1:02:06.994 --> 1:02:08.162
Is she okay?

1:02:08.195 --> 1:02:10.064
So I
just need to verify

1:02:10.097 --> 1:02:11.865
that you are related to her.

1:02:11.899 --> 1:02:13.000
Yeah, we're friends.

1:02:14.134 --> 1:02:15.503
Oh,
I can't disclose

1:02:15.537 --> 1:02:16.904
private health information.

1:02:16.937 --> 1:02:18.506
We're dating,
we're going on dates.

1:02:18.540 --> 1:02:19.773
We live together.

1:02:20.941 --> 1:02:22.309
Oh, well she
didn't mention a boyfriend.

1:02:22.343 --> 1:02:24.278
She gave you me my
number, didn't she?

1:02:25.145 --> 1:02:26.247
Yes.

1:02:26.280 --> 1:02:27.147
Is she okay?

1:02:28.182 --> 1:02:29.250
Stable.

1:02:29.283 --> 1:02:31.118
We have her on oxygen.

1:02:31.151 --> 1:02:33.254
Okay, I have so
many questions.

1:02:33.287 --> 1:02:35.523
Ooh,
okay, I gotta go.

1:02:35.557 --> 1:02:37.925
Sorry, it's my first
rapid response.

1:02:37.958 --> 1:02:39.960
What do you mean first?

1:02:39.994 --> 1:02:41.195
I'm new.

1:02:41.228 --> 1:02:42.096
How new?

1:02:43.264 --> 1:02:45.533
Actually I started
the day before yesterday.

1:02:45.567 --> 1:02:49.370
This has been a big week
for me, to say the least.

1:02:49.403 --> 1:02:51.939
Just to be clear, you have
finished medical school, right?

1:02:51.972 --> 1:02:52.873
Oh God.

1:02:52.906 --> 1:02:54.375
Yes, babe, of course.

1:02:54.408 --> 1:02:55.976
When?

1:02:56.010 --> 1:02:57.545
Actually
the day before yesterday.

1:02:57.579 --> 1:02:58.412
Okay, bye.

1:03:12.359 --> 1:03:13.193
Hello?

1:03:13.227 --> 1:03:15.329
Hi, hi, this is Ravi.

1:03:15.362 --> 1:03:18.032
I was told this was the
number to the room of Rita.

1:03:18.065 --> 1:03:19.534
Oh,
this is her roommate.

1:03:19.567 --> 1:03:20.801
Where's Rita?

1:03:21.902 --> 1:03:24.004
Taking a shit.

1:03:24.038 --> 1:03:25.839
She looks good though, sweety.

1:03:25.873 --> 1:03:28.175
Walking around, smiling.

1:03:28.208 --> 1:03:30.177
Only two liters oxygen.

1:03:30.210 --> 1:03:31.912
Is that good?

1:03:31.945 --> 1:03:33.314
Better than me.

1:03:33.347 --> 1:03:37.985
Could you please tell her
that Ravi Sharma called?

1:03:38.018 --> 1:03:39.186
Mhmm.

1:03:39.219 --> 1:03:40.321
Thank you, do you need
me to spell that out?

1:03:40.354 --> 1:03:42.189
No.

1:03:42.222 --> 1:03:43.357
I think I got it.

1:03:43.390 --> 1:03:44.358
I think I can tell her.

1:03:44.391 --> 1:03:45.593
It's good, it's all good.

1:04:11.285 --> 1:04:13.954
Oh, fuck.

1:04:13.987 --> 1:04:15.255
Wow that's good.

1:04:21.529 --> 1:04:22.996
Mm, that's good.

1:04:24.498 --> 1:04:25.366
Mm.

1:04:27.602 --> 1:04:28.469
Ah!

1:04:34.141 --> 1:04:35.142
Mmm, mm, mm!

1:04:48.355 --> 1:04:49.356
Mmm!

1:05:51.251 --> 1:05:52.520
You're sick.

1:05:52.554 --> 1:05:53.387
You're sick.

1:05:58.091 --> 1:05:59.426
She's not even your wife.

1:06:00.394 --> 1:06:02.162
- Hi, Swati.
- Hi.

1:06:02.196 --> 1:06:03.464
Hi, I'm Ravi.

1:06:03.497 --> 1:06:05.065
Nice to e-meet you.

1:06:05.098 --> 1:06:06.300
Ravi, yeah.

1:06:06.333 --> 1:06:08.570
I never know how to
start these things.

1:06:08.603 --> 1:06:10.170
- Yeah.
- It's always so weird.

1:06:10.204 --> 1:06:12.039
Thank you for
making the time, yeah.

1:06:12.072 --> 1:06:13.608
Oh yeah, sorry.

1:06:13.641 --> 1:06:16.477
I've been really busy with,

1:06:16.511 --> 1:06:18.780
you know, I work
at a law firm, so

1:06:18.813 --> 1:06:20.648
- Right, right.
- It's always busy.

1:06:20.682 --> 1:06:22.015
- Right.
- Right.

1:06:22.049 --> 1:06:24.151
I'm also glad we
can finally do this.

1:06:24.184 --> 1:06:25.219
- Yeah.
- You know it's like

1:06:25.252 --> 1:06:26.754
- hard to get a hold of.
- Yeah.

1:06:26.788 --> 1:06:28.322
Do you have any male friends?

1:06:29.657 --> 1:06:30.625
What?

1:06:30.658 --> 1:06:32.493
I just asked if you
had any male friends,

1:06:32.527 --> 1:06:36.096
like, do you have any
friends of the opposite sex?

1:06:36.129 --> 1:06:39.099
Because I just, I have
this friend Rita and she,

1:06:39.132 --> 1:06:41.736
Oh you want to know if
I know someone for Rita.

1:06:41.769 --> 1:06:44.739
I don't off the top of my head.

1:06:44.772 --> 1:06:46.039
No, it's just,

1:06:47.140 --> 1:06:50.778
I just, it's just so infuriating
because she, you know,

1:06:50.812 --> 1:06:54.047
I clean this apartment
like crazy, our apartment

1:06:54.081 --> 1:06:56.618
and she just makes it dirty
right away, and it's like,

1:06:56.651 --> 1:06:58.252
Wait.

1:06:58.285 --> 1:07:02.289
You live with Rita who's a girl?

1:07:04.358 --> 1:07:05.359
Yeah, well...

1:07:06.260 --> 1:07:07.829
I think the connection's
a little bit bad.

1:07:07.862 --> 1:07:11.131
Why don't you tell me a
little bit about yourself?

1:07:11.164 --> 1:07:12.366
Okay, well.

1:07:12.399 --> 1:07:15.402
Well I'm not sure what
my mom told your mom,

1:07:15.435 --> 1:07:19.473
but I am looking for something
just like more traditional.

1:07:19.507 --> 1:07:24.512
Like not like an open thing
or something like that.

1:07:25.312 --> 1:07:26.213
Oh yeah, me too.

1:07:26.246 --> 1:07:28.348
I don't, you know, I mean,

1:07:28.382 --> 1:07:29.617
if I get married
like at this point,

1:07:29.651 --> 1:07:31.485
I'll be lucky if Rita's invited.

1:07:31.519 --> 1:07:32.419
You know what I mean?

1:07:32.452 --> 1:07:35.389
Oh, is she like your sister?

1:07:35.422 --> 1:07:39.459
Oh no, oh no, no
she's not my sister.

1:07:41.194 --> 1:07:43.096
That would not be good

1:07:43.130 --> 1:07:45.533
if she was my sister if
you know what I mean.

1:07:45.567 --> 1:07:47.367
No, you should
probably spell it out

1:07:47.401 --> 1:07:48.536
because I'm a lawyer.

1:07:48.570 --> 1:07:50.337
I need things spelled out.

1:07:50.370 --> 1:07:52.172
What are your feelings
on like, you know,

1:07:52.205 --> 1:07:55.275
if two people of the
opposite sex that are Indian

1:07:55.309 --> 1:07:57.244
have, you know, hugged a bunch

1:07:57.277 --> 1:08:00.815
and maybe slept in a bed
together, but nothing else?

1:08:00.848 --> 1:08:03.518
Is this about you?

1:08:03.551 --> 1:08:06.486
No, I'm asking for a friend.

1:08:06.521 --> 1:08:08.690
Is your friend Rita?

1:08:09.557 --> 1:08:11.559
Yeah, yeah.

1:08:11.593 --> 1:08:13.327
I think she told me
that story, yeah.

1:08:13.360 --> 1:08:15.095
So she did that.

1:08:15.930 --> 1:08:17.097
What do you,

1:08:17.130 --> 1:08:19.333
do you think that's going to
work out with her and this guy?

1:08:19.366 --> 1:08:21.234
Well, if I were her,

1:08:21.268 --> 1:08:24.706
I would want you to tell
me how you feel directly.

1:08:27.709 --> 1:08:30.177
Do you believe in a soulmate?

1:08:30.210 --> 1:08:31.278
I used to.

1:08:31.311 --> 1:08:32.714
Now it's kind of like,

1:08:34.247 --> 1:08:37.184
you kind of have to deal
with what you get, you know?

1:08:54.769 --> 1:08:55.603
Hello?

1:08:55.637 --> 1:08:56.838
Rita?

1:08:56.871 --> 1:08:58.573
No.

1:08:58.606 --> 1:08:59.907
Who is this?

1:08:59.941 --> 1:09:01.909
It's Rita's friend.

1:09:01.943 --> 1:09:02.910
I've been calling her cell.

1:09:02.944 --> 1:09:03.945
She doesn't answer.

1:09:03.978 --> 1:09:05.847
I don't know what to do.

1:09:05.880 --> 1:09:08.516
She's okay, she's
in the hospital.

1:09:11.351 --> 1:09:13.186
What?

1:09:13.855 --> 1:09:16.924
She has COVID, auntie,

1:09:16.958 --> 1:09:19.192
but she's only on
two liters of oxygen.

1:09:19.226 --> 1:09:21.228
Who
the hell are you?

1:09:21.261 --> 1:09:23.330
I'm Ravi.

1:09:23.363 --> 1:09:24.832
We met recently.

1:09:24.866 --> 1:09:27.234
She let me stay
over after my train-

1:09:27.267 --> 1:09:28.569
- Ravi Sharma?

1:09:29.570 --> 1:09:30.538
Yes.

1:09:30.571 --> 1:09:31.572
What the
hell are you still doing

1:09:31.606 --> 1:09:32.874
at my daughter's place?

1:09:32.907 --> 1:09:34.809
My car got delayed.

1:09:34.842 --> 1:09:36.811
I
need to talk to Rita.

1:09:36.844 --> 1:09:39.212
I understand.

1:09:39.246 --> 1:09:42.717
I can give you the number
for her room in the hospital,

1:09:42.750 --> 1:09:45.352
but I've been trying
and I can't get through.

1:09:45.385 --> 1:09:46.988
Is she okay?

1:09:47.021 --> 1:09:48.188
Yes.

1:09:49.489 --> 1:09:50.758
Is she okay?

1:09:50.792 --> 1:09:52.359
Yes, yes, she's fine.

1:09:52.392 --> 1:09:53.561
She's totally fine.

1:09:53.594 --> 1:09:56.931
You know, she's so
strong and so young.

1:09:58.800 --> 1:10:01.803
I
love her so much.

1:10:01.836 --> 1:10:02.704
I know.

1:10:11.979 --> 1:10:13.246
Rita, hi!

1:10:13.280 --> 1:10:14.448
- Hey!
- Hey.

1:10:14.481 --> 1:10:16.751
Hey, I've been trying
to get through.

1:10:16.784 --> 1:10:18.019
How are you?

1:10:18.052 --> 1:10:19.687
I'm good.

1:10:20.655 --> 1:10:21.789
Okay, good.

1:10:21.823 --> 1:10:23.390
Are you still only
on two liters?

1:10:24.391 --> 1:10:25.258
Yeah.

1:10:27.294 --> 1:10:28.361
How's your roommate?

1:10:32.934 --> 1:10:33.901
Not great.

1:10:34.936 --> 1:10:35.803
What happened?

1:10:37.672 --> 1:10:38.706
She's dead.

1:10:40.742 --> 1:10:41.576
Rita.

1:10:44.344 --> 1:10:46.914
It was so sudden.

1:10:49.382 --> 1:10:52.019
She died looking at a
bunch of masked faces.

1:10:53.420 --> 1:10:54.454
Isn't that weird?

1:10:58.726 --> 1:10:59.660
I miss you.

1:11:00.928 --> 1:11:02.395
I miss you too.

1:11:04.565 --> 1:11:05.700
I barely know you.

1:11:06.634 --> 1:11:07.502
Yeah.

1:11:10.004 --> 1:11:10.838
I miss you.

1:11:13.541 --> 1:11:14.776
I miss you too.

1:11:27.822 --> 1:11:28.956
Small
fever last night, but

1:11:28.990 --> 1:11:32.059
her ferritin's down, d-dimers
down, pressure's stable

1:11:32.093 --> 1:11:33.227
hovering around
two liters again.

1:11:33.261 --> 1:11:36.697
It's an unpredictable
disease but she's doing well.

1:11:36.731 --> 1:11:37.832
Okay, that's good.

1:11:37.865 --> 1:11:39.934
She cries
anytime anyone leaves the room.

1:11:39.967 --> 1:11:40.902
What?

1:11:40.935 --> 1:11:43.403
She just
gets a little teary.

1:11:43.436 --> 1:11:44.772
I went and sat
with her for a bit

1:11:44.806 --> 1:11:47.474
and everyone keeps
telling me I only do that

1:11:47.508 --> 1:11:50.111
because I'm new.

1:11:50.144 --> 1:11:52.013
Anyway, she eventually
told me to leave.

1:11:52.046 --> 1:11:54.447
And when I did, she
started crying again.

1:11:54.481 --> 1:11:56.050
He's a liar and a bitch.

1:11:56.083 --> 1:11:57.752
He seems really nice.

1:11:57.785 --> 1:12:00.621
He gets sweaty every
time he talks to me.

1:12:00.655 --> 1:12:01.956
I think I make him nervous.

1:12:01.989 --> 1:12:03.591
Yeah, I can see that.

1:12:04.725 --> 1:12:05.893
He's new.

1:12:05.927 --> 1:12:06.794
Yeah.

1:12:08.830 --> 1:12:10.363
I like him a lot.

1:12:10.397 --> 1:12:11.833
Yeah, me too.

1:12:11.866 --> 1:12:13.466
Number 17 is on the way.

1:12:15.136 --> 1:12:18.706
Uh oh, number 14
is in the lead now.

1:12:18.739 --> 1:12:20.575
The
last time I brought

1:12:20.608 --> 1:12:21.509
my famous malai kofta,

1:12:21.542 --> 1:12:22.677
they didn't even touch it.

1:12:22.710 --> 1:12:24.045
Well auntie, it
sounds like the ladies

1:12:24.078 --> 1:12:26.346
from your bridge club
are very judgmental.

1:12:29.817 --> 1:12:30.818
My SAT score?

1:12:32.553 --> 1:12:34.454
I think this was back, auntie,

1:12:34.487 --> 1:12:36.891
when the test was out
of 1600. So it was 1450.

1:12:38.025 --> 1:12:40.460
No, I know I could
have done better.

1:12:40.493 --> 1:12:42.997
Oh, 14 is checking in on 17.

1:12:44.966 --> 1:12:45.833
Let's see.

1:12:47.568 --> 1:12:48.836
Do
you know how to Zoom?

1:12:48.870 --> 1:12:49.737
Zoom?

1:12:51.172 --> 1:12:52.640
Yes, I've Zoomed, auntie.

1:12:53.541 --> 1:12:54.407
I would like to Zoom.

1:12:56.744 --> 1:12:59.013
Does your mother
make malai kofta?

1:12:59.046 --> 1:12:59.981
Yes.

1:13:00.014 --> 1:13:01.782
But mine will be much better.

1:13:01.816 --> 1:13:03.751
So I want you to try it.

1:13:03.784 --> 1:13:05.052
Oh yeah, I would love to.

1:13:07.188 --> 1:13:10.057
She made
good progress last night.

1:13:10.091 --> 1:13:11.759
That's great.

1:13:11.792 --> 1:13:13.493
Thank
you for updating me

1:13:13.527 --> 1:13:14.996
since she won't call me.

1:13:15.029 --> 1:13:16.530
Of course.

1:13:16.564 --> 1:13:17.798
She is very strong.

1:13:18.666 --> 1:13:20.134
Yeah, I know.

1:13:20.167 --> 1:13:22.503
Why are you still there?

1:13:22.536 --> 1:13:24.872
Don't you have a
life to get back to?

1:13:26.974 --> 1:13:27.842
I don't know.

1:13:29.977 --> 1:13:32.079
Thank you for staying.

1:13:33.948 --> 1:13:34.815
Of course.

1:13:36.684 --> 1:13:39.186
I have to
tell you something.

1:13:39.220 --> 1:13:40.121
That day?

1:13:40.988 --> 1:13:41.856
Which day?

1:13:42.823 --> 1:13:45.159
I didn't go to Daddy.

1:13:45.192 --> 1:13:48.095
I just walked around and around.

1:13:49.730 --> 1:13:50.598
Oh.

1:13:51.565 --> 1:13:53.768
But you were gone for
a long time though.

1:13:54.869 --> 1:13:58.706
I laid down
in a park, fell asleep.

1:14:00.942 --> 1:14:04.111
And I went to the drug store
and touched everything.

1:14:05.112 --> 1:14:05.947
Everything.

1:14:07.848 --> 1:14:09.482
Then I licked my fingers.

1:14:10.251 --> 1:14:11.719
Rita, are you joking?

1:14:13.054 --> 1:14:13.921
No.

1:14:15.156 --> 1:14:16.857
Rita, why would you do that?

1:14:18.592 --> 1:14:21.162
There's nothing
worse than sitting at home,

1:14:22.096 --> 1:14:24.632
like you're cornered and afraid.

1:14:24.665 --> 1:14:29.670
Just sitting, afraid,
alone, afraid.

1:14:31.806 --> 1:14:33.007
Alone.

1:14:38.012 --> 1:14:40.881
Rita?

1:14:43.651 --> 1:14:44.518
Rita?

1:14:53.327 --> 1:14:55.830
Hi, hi, I need to be
transferred to nine west.

1:14:59.233 --> 1:15:00.735
No, I need nine west.

1:15:00.768 --> 1:15:02.870
I think they're transferred
me to the wrong place,

1:15:02.903 --> 1:15:04.038
But she-

1:15:04.071 --> 1:15:05.706
She's just going
to hang up on me?

1:15:07.341 --> 1:15:11.012
Hi, hi, I need to be transferred
to nine west, it's urgent.

1:15:11.045 --> 1:15:12.279
No, I need nine west,

1:15:12.313 --> 1:15:14.515
they transferred me
to the wrong place.

1:15:17.051 --> 1:15:17.918
Shit!

1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:23.224
Nine west, the ninth
floor of the west ward.

1:15:24.592 --> 1:15:26.027
Hello?

1:15:33.667 --> 1:15:35.069
She's sedated now.

1:15:35.102 --> 1:15:36.737
After delirium, we see this.

1:15:37.738 --> 1:15:38.906
What's delirium?

1:15:39.974 --> 1:15:41.675
A confused state.

1:15:41.709 --> 1:15:44.211
Her brain is kind of disassociating
from pain and trauma.

1:15:45.746 --> 1:15:47.815
- What's her prognosis?
- I don't know.

1:15:47.848 --> 1:15:50.751
She could wake up tomorrow
or in months, or...

1:15:50.785 --> 1:15:52.620
Look, I can't take
away the uncertainty

1:15:52.653 --> 1:15:53.954
and I wish I could.

1:15:53.988 --> 1:15:55.756
I want to see her.

1:15:55.790 --> 1:15:56.857
I know, Ravi.

1:16:05.032 --> 1:16:05.966
Hey, mom.

1:16:06.834 --> 1:16:08.069
Hi, betta.

1:16:08.102 --> 1:16:09.637
Can I ask about dad?

1:16:10.771 --> 1:16:12.773
Sure, sure.

1:16:12.807 --> 1:16:14.975
What did you think
when you first saw him?

1:16:17.378 --> 1:16:18.846
Honestly?

1:16:18.879 --> 1:16:20.014
Yeah.

1:16:20.047 --> 1:16:22.216
I
thought he was hot.

1:16:22.249 --> 1:16:23.617
Really hot.

1:16:23.651 --> 1:16:25.219
Okay, I get it.

1:16:25.252 --> 1:16:26.353
Big arms.

1:16:26.387 --> 1:16:27.388
Big uh...

1:16:27.421 --> 1:16:29.123
Why didn't you make it work?

1:16:31.125 --> 1:16:32.860
Didn't you feel so lucky?

1:16:33.994 --> 1:16:35.930
You had a whole
life handed to you

1:16:36.897 --> 1:16:37.798
on a platter.

1:16:38.866 --> 1:16:40.968
Oh, betta.

1:16:43.003 --> 1:16:46.240
We both are too
different, you know that.

1:16:47.975 --> 1:16:52.980
The truth is ultimately
we all choose to love

1:16:53.881 --> 1:16:55.382
or not to love.

1:16:57.418 --> 1:17:01.355
Hey, I have a funny
news story for you.

1:17:01.388 --> 1:17:04.191
A man in Argentina

1:17:04.225 --> 1:17:07.695
was floating on a sailboat
before the pandemic.

1:17:07.728 --> 1:17:08.863
I know that story.

1:17:09.763 --> 1:17:11.398
The ocean cowboy.

1:17:11.432 --> 1:17:13.267
Betta,
he just came back.

1:17:13.300 --> 1:17:16.036
He landed in Buenos
Aires yesterday

1:17:17.171 --> 1:17:18.839
and now he knows.

1:17:20.808 --> 1:17:22.343
He knows everything.

1:17:25.179 --> 1:17:26.247
Imagine that.

1:18:50.898 --> 1:18:53.901
It's temporary, auntie,
that's what they say.

1:18:53.934 --> 1:18:57.271
It's a kind of fog and
it's going to lift.

1:19:24.465 --> 1:19:25.399
Are you serious?

1:19:27.334 --> 1:19:28.202
What time?

1:19:32.507 --> 1:19:34.008
No, I'll come pick her up.

1:19:48.055 --> 1:19:49.156
I want to walk.

1:19:49.189 --> 1:19:50.958
Are you sure you're
well enough to?

1:19:50.991 --> 1:19:52.393
I swabbed negative.

1:19:52.426 --> 1:19:53.561
Meet me at the park.

1:19:53.595 --> 1:19:55.329
Rita, that's a
really long walk.

1:19:56.397 --> 1:19:57.565
We'll
stop if we have to,

1:19:57.599 --> 1:19:59.066
we'll call a car if we have to,

1:19:59.099 --> 1:20:00.134
but I want to walk.

1:20:03.538 --> 1:20:05.339
Did you do the math?

1:20:05.372 --> 1:20:06.840
What math?

1:20:06.874 --> 1:20:08.309
We met seven days ago.

1:20:10.978 --> 1:20:12.446
I want to say something to you.

1:20:14.915 --> 1:20:16.016
Say it in person.

1:23:06.788 --> 1:23:10.257
Mala and I have been
married for 47 years now.

1:23:12.192 --> 1:23:14.596
I think it's been
nearly 33 years now,

1:23:15.663 --> 1:23:17.231
- since we've been.
- It'll be 33 this year

1:23:17.264 --> 1:23:19.099
- yeah.
- 33 this year.

1:23:20.602 --> 1:23:23.470
We've been married
for 15 years.

1:23:25.272 --> 1:23:27.509
We've been married
for now what?

1:23:27.542 --> 1:23:28.776
Almost nine years.

1:23:28.810 --> 1:23:29.744
Yeah, nine years.

1:23:31.546 --> 1:23:35.115
I don't think soulmates
necessary exist.

1:23:35.148 --> 1:23:36.316
I think they're created.

1:23:38.820 --> 1:23:41.355
She's the most
important person to me.

1:23:41.388 --> 1:23:42.222
Oh?

1:23:42.256 --> 1:23:43.357
Even after them.

1:23:43.390 --> 1:23:44.659
What about me?

1:23:46.460 --> 1:23:47.562
What do we mean to each other?

1:23:47.595 --> 1:23:49.363
We are very attached
to each other.

1:23:49.396 --> 1:23:51.164
We are like best friends.

1:23:52.867 --> 1:23:54.502
So we mean a lot to each other.

1:23:57.337 --> 1:23:59.541
She's the number
one person in my life.

1:23:59.574 --> 1:24:01.408
Has been like that always.

1:24:01.441 --> 1:24:03.410
Oh, where's my tissue?

1:24:05.178 --> 1:24:06.848
A lot of conversations
and then meetings

1:24:06.881 --> 1:24:09.116
and slowly we
started with getting,

1:24:09.149 --> 1:24:11.586
we started getting
one of each other and

1:24:11.619 --> 1:24:13.588
we would just wait to
talk to each other.

1:24:13.621 --> 1:24:15.590
And I think in the process,

1:24:15.623 --> 1:24:16.758
we didn't even come to know

1:24:16.791 --> 1:24:19.493
when we fell in love
with each other.
