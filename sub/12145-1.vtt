Ashlee darling.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.283
Hm?

02:03.331 --> 02:04.581
Wake up.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.917
Hm.

02:08.545 --> 02:10.921
Wake up.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.599
Temperatures are going
to do nothing but go down.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.769
We'll have another very cold day tomorrow.

02:25.854 --> 02:28.397
Morning.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.274
...to freezing rain.

02:30.358 --> 02:33.318
The Freewill Baptist Church
is having a fundraiser,

02:33.403 --> 02:35.195
a covered-dish event,
that's coming up here

02:35.238 --> 02:37.656
on Thursday evening,

02:37.740 --> 02:40.075
so they're having a band concert.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.495
That will be on Friday night
at the high school.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.497
Better than nothing.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.578
Who's this?

03:24.662 --> 03:26.121
Peanut Butter.

03:26.247 --> 03:27.789
Where'd you find Peanut Butter?

03:27.874 --> 03:29.708
In the woods.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.923
He's sweet.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.426
Spell "house."

03:39.510 --> 03:41.345
H-O

03:41.429 --> 03:43.347
H-O...

03:43.431 --> 03:45.015
A-woo.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.017
U-A?

03:47.101 --> 03:48.644
- Uh-uh.
- U.

03:48.728 --> 03:50.395
Ssssss.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.980
S-E?

03:52.065 --> 03:53.899
H-O-U-S-E.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.570
7 plus 2.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.157
9.

04:02.283 --> 04:03.951
Good.

04:11.125 --> 04:12.751
Transfer.

04:12.835 --> 04:14.086
Careful.

04:17.131 --> 04:19.049
Cradle the head,

04:19.133 --> 04:21.426
and then take him to your shoulder...

04:22.887 --> 04:24.554
so he's up a little bit higher

04:24.639 --> 04:27.224
but you're still supporting the head.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.102
Make sure you hold this right under--

04:30.186 --> 04:32.688
Could I have your attention, please?

04:32.772 --> 04:34.982
Forsyth, Missouri chapter

04:35.066 --> 04:37.859
of the Family, Consumer,
and Career Leaders of America--

04:37.944 --> 04:39.403
Hey, Ree.

04:39.487 --> 04:43.782
...will meet this Friday at 3:00 p.m.
in Mrs. Boyer's room.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.617
Truman University will be here--

04:45.702 --> 04:47.995
Forward, march!

04:48.079 --> 04:49.830
If you would like to attend,

04:49.914 --> 04:52.165
please sign up in the counselor's office.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.667
March time.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.588
Forward, march.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.885
The Marine Corps Birthday Ball

05:03.970 --> 05:05.512
will be this Saturday in the men's--

05:05.596 --> 05:10.350
All other P.C. cadets and their families
are encouraged to attend.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.605
All right.

05:31.122 --> 05:32.414
Hi, Sonya.

05:32.498 --> 05:34.958
Hey, Ree.

05:40.048 --> 05:41.882
You and the kids all right?

05:41.966 --> 05:45.969
We're just a little short on cash right now.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.681
How long's it been since the horse ate?

05:49.766 --> 05:51.725
About four days.

05:51.809 --> 05:53.310
That hay gets kind of expensive, don't it?

05:53.394 --> 05:55.145
Yes ma'am.

05:57.231 --> 06:00.525
Actually, l was wondering
if you could keep her with yours.

06:15.833 --> 06:18.251
All right, Ginger, come on.

06:18.336 --> 06:19.920
That's a girl.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.713
There you go. There you go.

06:21.798 --> 06:23.090
Have a little bit of that.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.428
Come on. Get going.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.514
Thank you, Sonya.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.557
All right.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.524
How are you today?

07:22.608 --> 07:24.484
Ask me inside.

07:24.527 --> 07:25.986
I need to talk some with your mama.

07:30.741 --> 07:33.118
She don't talk much.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.333
Ma'am?

07:40.418 --> 07:42.210
I was wondering
if I could ask you a few questions.

07:44.005 --> 07:45.589
Ma'am?

07:52.722 --> 07:54.598
You better just tell me.

08:00.354 --> 08:02.522
You know your daddy's
out on bond, don't you?

08:03.524 --> 08:05.942
So what?

08:06.027 --> 08:07.986
Looks like he's been cooking again.

08:08.070 --> 08:11.531
l know that's the charges you laid on him,
but you ain't proved it on him.

08:11.574 --> 08:13.658
You got to prove it every time.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.453
Well, that won't be no hard thing to do,

08:16.537 --> 08:18.622
but that ain't even why l'm here.

08:18.706 --> 08:22.667
His court date's next week,
and l can't seem to turn him up.

08:22.752 --> 08:24.252
Maybe he sees you and ducks.

08:24.337 --> 08:27.923
That could be,

08:28.007 --> 08:30.175
but where you all come into this is,

08:30.259 --> 08:31.927
he put this house here,

08:32.011 --> 08:34.179
and your timber acres, up for his bond.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.598
He what, now?

08:36.682 --> 08:39.768
Jessup signed over everything.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.770
Now, if he doesn't show at trial, see,

08:41.854 --> 08:45.482
the way the deal works is,
you all gonna lose this place.

08:49.737 --> 08:51.655
You got some place to go?

08:53.282 --> 08:54.741
l'll find him.

08:54.825 --> 08:57.577
- Girl, I've been looking.
- I said I'll find him.

09:08.923 --> 09:12.092
You make sure your daddy
knows the gravity of this deal.

09:43.332 --> 09:46.001
Maybe they'll share some of that with us.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.544
That could be.

09:49.088 --> 09:50.839
Maybe we should ask.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.470
Never ask for what ought to be offered.

10:10.526 --> 10:13.403
Evening, Ree.

10:13.487 --> 10:18.199
- Evening.
- Kids. Hey, Connie.

10:18.284 --> 10:21.036
Didn't want you to think
we'd forgot you all.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.788
Brought you some meat, some potatoes,

10:23.873 --> 10:26.791
and some stuff for a good stew, anyway.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.251
Thank you. We can use it.

10:28.336 --> 10:31.338
I seen your woodpile's low out front.

10:31.422 --> 10:34.341
We got that splitter up there in the yard.

10:34.425 --> 10:35.675
You should use it.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.677
l'll do that.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.305
We seen the law was
out here this afternoon.

10:40.389 --> 10:41.806
Everything all right?

10:41.891 --> 10:44.142
He's huntin' for Dad.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.769
Hunting Jessup, is he?

10:48.689 --> 10:50.231
You know where he's at?

10:50.316 --> 10:52.567
No.

10:52.693 --> 10:54.444
You sure about that?

10:57.490 --> 10:58.865
Yes.

10:58.949 --> 11:01.451
All right.

11:01.535 --> 11:04.287
All right, well l guess you didn't have
nothing to tell him then, did you?

11:04.372 --> 11:07.290
I wouldn't tell him nothing if l did.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.709
Honey, we know that.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.753
I'm going to let you get to it, all right?

11:23.474 --> 11:25.600
How about some deer stew.
That sound good?

11:25.726 --> 11:26.726
Mm-hm.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.396
Both of you need to get over here
and watch how I make it.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.637
Thank God it's you, Sweet Pea,

12:02.763 --> 12:04.222
and not Floyd's
mommy and daddy again.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.809
Them two watch me
like I done something wrong.

12:07.893 --> 12:10.353
Hush your mouth about them.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.148
They put a roof
over your head, ain't they?

12:13.232 --> 12:17.277
Hey, Floyd. You gonna invite me in?

12:17.361 --> 12:20.989
Or I could just stay
out here and talk to you.

12:21.073 --> 12:22.991
Yeah, you can come in.

12:34.795 --> 12:36.796
Hey.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.508
Shit.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.303
Don't start.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.637
C'mon.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.900
It's been a while, Sweet Pea.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.235
Things stack up, is all.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.154
What's going on?

13:04.241 --> 13:07.243
The Sheriff came by looking for Dad.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.620
If he don't show up for his court date,

13:08.704 --> 13:09.913
we're gonna lose the house.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.211
I gotta get down to the Arkansas line.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.463
l gotta ask him.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.423
lt's his truck.

13:42.863 --> 13:44.489
He said no.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.115
Did you tell him I'd spring for gas?

13:46.200 --> 13:48.034
l told him. He still won't.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.577
Why not?

13:49.662 --> 13:50.954
He never says why not to me, Ree.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.664
He just says no.

13:52.748 --> 13:54.666
Man, that's so sad to hear you say

13:54.750 --> 13:57.794
he won't let you do something
and then you don't do it.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.296
lt's different once you're married.

14:02.383 --> 14:06.135
lt really must be because you ain't
never used to eat no shit.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.223
Ned needs his nap.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.393
Come here.

14:42.756 --> 14:45.049
What brings you here?

14:45.134 --> 14:47.051
Somebody dead?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.761
l'm looking for my Dad.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.183
Come on in. Shake off the chill.

14:58.022 --> 14:59.188
Let's keep it quiet.

14:59.273 --> 15:00.982
Teardrop's still laying up in bed.

15:08.407 --> 15:10.783
The law came by today.

15:10.868 --> 15:14.120
Dad signed over everything to his bond.

15:15.789 --> 15:19.459
Victoria, I really gotta run
Dad down to get him to show.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.294
- You ought not do that.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.297
Don't go running after Jessup.

15:26.550 --> 15:30.011
Show or don't show,
that choice is up to the one going to jail,

15:30.095 --> 15:31.971
not you.

15:32.014 --> 15:34.974
You know where he's at, don't you?

15:35.017 --> 15:39.520
Where a man's at ain't necessarily
for you to know, neither.

15:39.605 --> 15:41.731
- But you do.
- I ain't seen him.

15:49.323 --> 15:53.534
Could be running around
with Little Arthur and them, you think?

15:53.619 --> 15:55.036
Don't you ever go down
around Little Arthur's

15:55.120 --> 15:58.456
asking them people about shit
they ain't offering to talk about.

15:58.540 --> 16:02.335
That's a real good way
to end up bit by hogs...

16:02.419 --> 16:04.003
or wishing you was.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.383
We're all related, ain't we?

16:13.347 --> 16:17.892
Our relations get watered kind of thin
between here and Little Arthur's.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.644
You know all those people, Teardrop.

16:19.728 --> 16:21.479
- You could ask--
- Shut up.

16:21.563 --> 16:24.816
None of them's gonna be
in a great big hurry to tangle with you.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.026
l said shut up once already
with my mouth.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.911
Jesus. Dad's your only brother.

16:37.037 --> 16:39.747
You think I forgot that?

16:39.832 --> 16:41.374
Hm?

16:41.458 --> 16:44.043
Jessup and me run together
for coming on 40 years,

16:44.128 --> 16:45.753
but l don't know where he's at,

16:45.838 --> 16:48.589
and l ain't gonna go around
asking after him, neither.

16:53.429 --> 16:56.597
Ree, you still planning to join the Army?

16:56.682 --> 16:59.183
No, l don't think l can anymore.

17:02.187 --> 17:03.771
Listen.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.066
Hm?

17:10.279 --> 17:12.071
No.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.560
She needs help.

17:42.644 --> 17:43.895
Nope. Listen.

17:43.979 --> 17:45.772
Listen.

17:45.856 --> 17:49.984
You tell that girl to stay close to home.

17:50.110 --> 17:52.111
Don't move.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.197
Give her this.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.908
You send her ass on her way right now.

18:03.165 --> 18:07.960
Teardrop says you best keep
your ass real close to the willows, dear.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.463
He hopes this helps.

18:18.222 --> 18:20.723
Here's a doobie for your walk.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.475
Thank you.

19:25.789 --> 19:27.748
Hey.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.500
What's your business here?

19:29.585 --> 19:31.252
My dad's Jessup.

19:31.336 --> 19:34.338
He's pals with Little Arthur,
and I gotta find him.

19:39.845 --> 19:41.888
Hold on.

20:02.910 --> 20:05.161
My name's Megan.

20:06.288 --> 20:09.415
And l do know you, really.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.250
I seen you at some of the reunions.

20:13.253 --> 20:15.254
I knew Jessup when I seen him, too.

20:15.339 --> 20:18.132
Never did talk with him much.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.801
You knew him?

20:20.886 --> 20:24.764
Knew him when I seen him
around, I mean.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.766
He does stuff l hear about.

20:26.850 --> 20:29.644
- He cooks crank.
- They all do now.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.479
You don't even need to say it out loud.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.949
If Arthur's been running
on crank for a day or two,

20:43.033 --> 20:44.909
you shouId just leave, okay?

20:53.835 --> 20:55.962
l knew it.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.297
l been in your dreams,
ain't l, little Ruthie?

20:58.382 --> 21:01.092
lt's Ree, you asshole.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.844
l'm only out to find Dad.

21:06.515 --> 21:07.848
Come on in, ladies.

21:18.777 --> 21:21.320
This don't gotta take long, man.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.864
l'm looking for Dad and thought maybe
you'd been seeing him.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.993
Maybe you two been getting
into stuff together again.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.580
Not since the summer,

21:31.665 --> 21:33.332
at ya'll's place.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.334
You ain't seen him nowhere since then?

21:35.377 --> 21:36.877
Uh-uh.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.466
He kept leaving
the house, going some place.

21:42.551 --> 21:45.052
You don't know where?

21:45.137 --> 21:46.804
You got cat shit in your ear, girl?

21:46.888 --> 21:50.391
I've got them two kids
and my Mom to tend, man.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.059
l need him.

21:52.144 --> 21:56.355
If I see the dude, I'll tell him you said
that.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.612
Your dad left you to do all that?

22:03.697 --> 22:05.406
That's fucked up.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.994
Well, he had to.

22:11.455 --> 22:13.831
The way things go, you know.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.925
You want a line?

22:25.010 --> 22:28.220
No.

22:28.305 --> 22:29.930
You wanna blow some smoke?

22:30.015 --> 22:32.892
No.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.852
Then l guess l got nothin' for you.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.190
Go on.

22:48.992 --> 22:51.994
Don't tell nobody it was me
who told you this, okay?

22:53.163 --> 22:54.789
But you're going to have to go on
up the hill

22:54.873 --> 22:57.291
and ask for a talk with Thump Milton.

22:57.417 --> 23:00.086
Now, l hope he'll talk with you.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.088
He generally won't.

23:02.172 --> 23:04.882
That man scares me
way more than the rest.

23:04.966 --> 23:08.135
Well, scared ain't a bad way
to be about him, neither, hon.

23:08.220 --> 23:09.678
He's my own grandpa,

23:09.763 --> 23:12.473
and l still make damn sure
l never piss him off none.

23:16.645 --> 23:18.437
You go see Thump.

23:22.317 --> 23:23.901
Go on.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.693
You got the wrong place, I expect.

24:07.070 --> 24:08.612
Who might you be?

24:08.697 --> 24:11.157
l'm Ree.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.200
My Dad's Jessup Dolly.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.836
You ain't here for trouble, are you?

24:23.920 --> 24:25.838
No, ma'am.

24:25.922 --> 24:28.048
'Cause one of my nephews is Buster Leroy,

24:28.133 --> 24:31.302
and didn't he shoot
your daddy one time?

24:31.386 --> 24:34.930
Yes, but that ain't got
nothing to do with me.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.932
They settled that theirselves, I think.

24:37.017 --> 24:38.934
Shooting him likely settled it.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.396
What is it you want?

24:42.522 --> 24:45.399
I got a real bad need to talk with Thump.

24:45.525 --> 24:48.444
And he ain't got no need to talk to you.

24:49.571 --> 24:51.906
But I need to.

24:51.990 --> 24:55.326
I really, I really, really
got to, ma'am, please.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.872
Some of our blood at least is the same.

24:59.956 --> 25:01.290
Ain't that supposed to mean something?

25:01.374 --> 25:03.167
Ain't that what is always said?

25:10.800 --> 25:13.761
Ain't you got no men could do this?

25:13.845 --> 25:15.554
No, ma'am, I don't.

25:19.267 --> 25:22.561
You go wait in the yard
somewhere by that coop,

25:22.604 --> 25:25.564
and l'll tell Thump you're here.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.899
Thanks.

26:01.351 --> 26:03.018
Come on, already.

26:16.616 --> 26:18.993
He ain't likely to have time for you, child.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.744
l've got to talk to him.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.621
If he don't know, nobody does.

26:22.664 --> 26:23.998
Nope.

26:24.082 --> 26:27.710
Talking just causes witnesses,
and he don't want for any of those.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.378
l'll wait.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.340
You need to get yourself on home.

26:35.468 --> 26:37.428
Here, drink it down and be on your way.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.273
Thanks.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.236
Thump knows you were in the valley, child,

26:54.321 --> 26:58.032
with Megan, and at Little Arthur's.

26:58.116 --> 27:00.868
He knows what you want to ask,
and he don't want to hear it.

27:00.952 --> 27:02.911
And that's it?

27:02.996 --> 27:05.998
He ain't gonna say nothing to me?

27:06.082 --> 27:08.834
lf you're listening, child,
you got your answer.

27:10.337 --> 27:12.171
So I guess come the nut-cutting,

27:12.255 --> 27:13.964
blood don't really mean shit
to the big man.

27:14.049 --> 27:15.507
Am I understanding that right?

27:17.427 --> 27:19.053
Don't you dare.

27:22.474 --> 27:25.100
Don't.

27:25.185 --> 27:28.062
I want you to listen to me, child.

27:28.146 --> 27:31.023
You need to turn around,
and get yourself on home.

27:41.868 --> 27:44.411
Don't you make me come
out here and tell you again.

28:13.441 --> 28:15.401
Ashlee Dawn, come inside.

28:16.778 --> 28:18.070
Bring Brownie and Cupcake.

28:32.001 --> 28:33.877
Ree, get out here!

28:36.131 --> 28:38.841
Do you know there's people going around
saying you best shut up?

28:38.925 --> 28:40.217
People you ought to listen to.

28:40.301 --> 28:42.261
- Get your ass in the truck.
- Don't touch me.

28:42.345 --> 28:45.013
- Get your ass in the truck.
- Get off!

28:45.098 --> 28:47.474
Get in the truck.

28:47.559 --> 28:49.226
Hey!

28:49.310 --> 28:50.811
Would you rather I hit you, boy?

28:50.895 --> 28:52.563
Sonny, get back in the house.

28:52.647 --> 28:55.566
Cook them taters till they're brown,
then turn the stove off.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.609
- Don't hurt my sister.
- Sonny!

28:57.694 --> 28:59.027
Having balls is good, boy.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.654
Don't let 'em get you hurt.

29:00.780 --> 29:01.905
Sonny, get in the house.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.826
Get your dumb ass in the truck.

29:05.910 --> 29:07.619
- I'm not getting in there with you.
- Get in the truck.

29:07.704 --> 29:09.329
There's something you need to see.

29:13.168 --> 29:17.129
Jessup and me
may have had our tussles,

29:17.213 --> 29:19.798
but he was my cousin.

29:19.841 --> 29:22.926
It's always a bad deal
when these things blow.

29:23.011 --> 29:24.303
Where are we going?

29:24.387 --> 29:26.346
- Down the road.
- Down the road to where?

29:26.431 --> 29:28.265
To someplace you need to see.

29:56.669 --> 29:59.880
This right here is the last place me
or anybody seen Jessup.

29:59.964 --> 30:02.049
He never blew no lab before.

30:02.133 --> 30:05.636
I know it, but something
must have jumped wrong this time.

30:05.720 --> 30:09.556
He's known for never fucking up labs
or cooking bad batches.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.767
He's known for knowing
what he's doing.

30:11.851 --> 30:14.853
Well, you cook long enough,
this is bound to happen.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.897
You're saying Dad's up there
burnt to a crisp?

30:16.981 --> 30:18.232
That's what I'm saying.

30:18.316 --> 30:19.650
l'm going up for a look.

30:19.734 --> 30:22.277
No! That shit's poison.

30:22.362 --> 30:23.904
lt'll rip the skin off your bones.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.073
lf Dad's up there,
l'm bringing him home to bury.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.908
Ree!

31:35.059 --> 31:38.395
Ree, l know losing Jessup

31:38.479 --> 31:40.355
leaves you all hurting over there.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.566
l know it's a lot to handle.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.443
We'll make do.

31:44.527 --> 31:45.986
Sonya and me talked about it.

31:46.070 --> 31:49.239
We feel we could take Sonny
off your hands.

31:49.324 --> 31:52.034
Not Ashlee, I don't reckon,
but we could take Sonny.

31:52.118 --> 31:54.036
You what?

31:54.120 --> 31:55.996
We could take him and raise
him up the rest of the way.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.165
My ass you will.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.750
We'd raise that boy way better

31:59.834 --> 32:01.960
than you and that
nut-job mama of yours can.

32:02.003 --> 32:04.796
Maybe on down the line
we'd take Ashlee, too.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.882
You go straight to hell, you son of a bitch.

32:06.966 --> 32:10.010
Sonny and Ashlee will die
living in a cave with me and Mama

32:10.094 --> 32:12.804
before they spend one night with you.

32:15.808 --> 32:17.559
God damn you.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.645
You must think I'm a stupid idiot.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.813
There's weeds growing
chin high in that place.

32:21.898 --> 32:23.982
lt must have been a year
since that place blew.

33:07.568 --> 33:10.195
Come here, look at this.
Ash, quit playing around. Come here.

33:12.699 --> 33:16.243
This trigger shoots this barrel.

33:16.327 --> 33:18.745
Now, there's hardly ever
gonna be a time where you need both,

33:18.830 --> 33:21.456
but if you gotta kill something
big and mean, then you use both.

33:21.541 --> 33:25.794
Now, this gun is what
you'll use when you're older,

33:25.878 --> 33:29.047
but this one is the gun I learned on.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.174
This is Daddy's squirrel gun.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.676
Now, the most important thing is

33:32.760 --> 33:36.138
do not put your finger on the trigger
unless you're ready to shoot,

33:36.222 --> 33:37.723
you're aimed at your target.

33:37.807 --> 33:40.475
And don't ever-- both of you look at me--

33:40.560 --> 33:44.146
never point this at each other, not ever.

33:44.230 --> 33:45.981
All right?

33:46.065 --> 33:47.607
Kneel down like you're praying.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.860
Yeah, just like that. Yup.

33:53.156 --> 33:54.406
You see that cross?

33:54.490 --> 33:56.575
lt's called the crosshairs.

33:56.659 --> 33:58.827
Aim that up with the middle
of your target,

33:58.911 --> 34:00.495
and when that's lined up in the middle,

34:00.580 --> 34:02.247
then you squeeze
the trigger and you shoot.

34:06.544 --> 34:07.961
- Okay.
- Ree.

34:08.087 --> 34:09.296
Hang in.

34:09.380 --> 34:10.964
Hey.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.008
We're back here. Put this down.

34:13.092 --> 34:14.551
Both of you sit on your hands.

34:14.635 --> 34:17.345
Don't touch it.

34:17.430 --> 34:19.639
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:19.724 --> 34:21.725
Damn, Sweet Pea.
What's with all the guns?

34:21.809 --> 34:25.312
Just teaching them a little bit of survival.

34:25.396 --> 34:26.772
Hi.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.405
Got the truck off him.

34:38.826 --> 34:42.120
You are who I always did
think you were, darlin'.

34:42.205 --> 34:44.664
You truly are.

35:03.684 --> 35:05.727
Now, you gotta turn it this way.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.354
Backwards?

35:07.438 --> 35:08.897
Yeah. Give me that.

35:13.653 --> 35:15.529
Does your mama know what's going on?

35:17.698 --> 35:19.241
l'm not sure.

35:19.325 --> 35:20.534
You think you should tell her?

35:20.618 --> 35:24.287
This is the exact shit
she went crazy trying to get away from.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.872
It'd be too mean to tell her.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.541
I guess she couldn't help anyhow.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.418
Nope.

You know me and Jessup
quit keeping company

37:44.303 --> 37:45.845
a good while ago.

37:47.723 --> 37:50.684
l figured.

37:50.768 --> 37:52.811
l thought you might still
know a thing or two.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.106
l'm kind of afraid l might.

37:58.234 --> 38:00.902
I wish I could kick back for this one, Ree.

38:00.987 --> 38:02.237
You still bad on the bottle?

38:02.321 --> 38:05.198
No. No, I give that up.

38:09.537 --> 38:11.413
A couple months ago,

38:11.497 --> 38:14.666
Jessup and me run across
each other by total accident.

38:17.837 --> 38:21.089
He got me to laughing so.

38:21.173 --> 38:23.466
Things rekindled for a day or two.

38:26.012 --> 38:27.595
Then he was gone again.

38:30.057 --> 38:33.226
About, maybe, three or four weeks back,

38:33.352 --> 38:36.730
l'd stopped at Cruikshank's,

38:36.814 --> 38:40.442
and he was in there with
three fellows I didn't know,

38:40.526 --> 38:43.028
and they didn't look
to be having no fun, either.

38:43.112 --> 38:44.821
Did Dad say anything?

38:44.905 --> 38:47.991
He looked square at me

38:48.075 --> 38:51.119
but acted like he didn't know me,

38:51.203 --> 38:53.705
like he'd never seen me before.

38:56.375 --> 38:59.377
Something real wrong was going on.

39:06.469 --> 39:07.844
l'm sorry.

39:16.103 --> 39:19.606
If you stay really still and quiet--

39:21.400 --> 39:22.650
...it'll come out. Bless you.

39:26.614 --> 39:28.615
How long do we have to wait for a squirrel?

39:28.699 --> 39:30.158
A long time, usually.

39:30.242 --> 39:32.160
Wish we could get deer.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.079
lt's not time for deer.

39:36.290 --> 39:37.665
When is it?

39:37.750 --> 39:39.751
ln the morning or at night.
You know that.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.756
Do you see one?

39:44.840 --> 39:47.509
- Mmm.
- I do.

39:47.593 --> 39:50.261
Where?

39:50.346 --> 39:51.596
There.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.432
Ah.

39:54.475 --> 39:58.228
You want to help me pull the trigger?

39:58.312 --> 40:00.105
All right, put your finger right there.

40:03.734 --> 40:05.485
All right, you guys want
these fried or stewed?

40:05.569 --> 40:06.903
- Fried.
- Fried.

40:06.987 --> 40:08.196
Fried?

40:08.280 --> 40:09.614
All right.

40:17.039 --> 40:18.790
- Hey.
- Hey.

40:24.463 --> 40:26.548
All right.
Now, get your fingers in there.

40:26.632 --> 40:28.174
l'll get mine in.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.844
1 , 2, 3.

40:30.928 --> 40:32.720
Pull. Pull hard.

40:37.226 --> 40:39.394
Now, l'm just gonna slit it down here.

40:43.566 --> 40:46.192
Now, get in there
and get them guts out.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.735
l don't want to.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.321
Sonny, there's a bunch of stuff

40:50.406 --> 40:52.240
that you're gonna have to get over
being scared of.

40:52.324 --> 40:54.325
l'm not scared. l just don't want to.

40:57.037 --> 40:58.496
Come on.

40:59.623 --> 41:00.915
Put your fingers in there.

41:05.212 --> 41:06.838
Good.

41:10.759 --> 41:12.760
Do we eat these parts?

41:12.845 --> 41:14.137
Not yet.

41:58.224 --> 42:02.018
- You think I forgot about you?
- What do you mean?

42:02.102 --> 42:04.187
Forgot about you and everything
happening over here?

42:04.271 --> 42:06.898
That's your business.
You forget us if you want.

42:10.361 --> 42:13.404
The law found Jessup's car
at Gullet Lake this morning.

42:13.489 --> 42:15.198
Somebody set fire to it last night,

42:15.282 --> 42:17.659
burnt it down to nothing almost.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.577
He wasn't in it.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.960
He's gone, ain't he?

42:30.422 --> 42:31.965
This is for you all.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.972
His court day was this morning.
He didn't show.

42:40.766 --> 42:43.101
I'd sell off your timber land
now while you can.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.853
No, uh-uh.
We won't be doin' nothin' like that.

42:45.938 --> 42:48.606
That's the very first thing they'll do.

42:48.691 --> 42:52.110
Once they've took this place
from under you all, girl,

42:52.194 --> 42:55.154
go out and cut them
hundred-year woods down to nubs.

42:58.701 --> 43:01.995
Might as well have the dough
to spend on your own.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.246
Hm?

43:20.639 --> 43:22.098
You get the taste for it yet?

43:22.182 --> 43:23.641
Not so far.

43:25.894 --> 43:27.895
Suit yourself, little girl.

43:30.065 --> 43:32.400
Them pills helping
your mama's mood any?

43:32.484 --> 43:36.446
She keeps takin' them,
but they ain't working.

43:40.492 --> 43:42.785
Tell her hey.

45:08.414 --> 45:09.956
Mom, look at me.

45:19.466 --> 45:22.176
There's things happening,
and I don't know what to do.

45:26.056 --> 45:29.100
Can you please help me this one time?

45:29.184 --> 45:30.685
Mom?

45:32.271 --> 45:33.771
Mom, look at me.

45:38.026 --> 45:40.778
Teardrop thinks
I should sell the woods, Mom.

45:46.785 --> 45:48.327
Should I sell?

45:52.708 --> 45:55.251
Please, help me this one time.

46:12.352 --> 46:14.270
l don't know what to do.

46:44.009 --> 46:46.469
Who the hell is he?

46:46.553 --> 46:49.555
Judging by that car, he ain't
from our neck of the woods.

47:02.361 --> 47:04.862
Mike Satterfield, A-1 Bonds.

47:05.906 --> 47:07.448
What is it you want?

47:07.533 --> 47:08.866
We hold the bond on Jessup Dolly,

47:08.909 --> 47:10.868
and now he's a runner, it looks like.

47:10.953 --> 47:12.411
Dad ain't no runner.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.413
He didn't show for court.
That makes him a runner.

47:14.498 --> 47:17.583
Will you excuse us, please?

47:17.668 --> 47:19.418
Go on.

47:21.588 --> 47:24.173
Look, I don't want to kick
your dad's ass, all right?

47:24.258 --> 47:26.133
I just want to keep the judge off mine.

47:26.218 --> 47:28.219
Dad is dead.

47:28.303 --> 47:30.638
He didn't show for court
'cause he's lying dead somewhere.

47:30.722 --> 47:32.014
When was the last time you saw him?

47:32.099 --> 47:33.891
A couple of weeks.

47:33.934 --> 47:36.269
Who's he running around with?
Where they all hanging out?

47:36.353 --> 47:38.479
He doesn't tell me that stuff, sir.

47:38.564 --> 47:39.939
You know I got the legal right

47:40.023 --> 47:42.608
to go in there hunting the man
any place l want.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.694
I know you'd be wasting your time

47:44.778 --> 47:47.613
and pissing me off.

47:47.698 --> 47:49.699
Jessup Dolly is dead.

47:49.783 --> 47:51.742
He's lying in a crappy grave somewhere

47:51.827 --> 47:53.953
or become piles of shit in a hog pen.

47:54.037 --> 47:56.622
Maybe he's been left out plain in the open.

47:56.707 --> 47:59.041
Wherever he is, he's there dead.

47:59.126 --> 48:01.043
And you know this how?

48:01.128 --> 48:02.795
You must've heard what Dollys are,
ain't you, mister?

48:02.921 --> 48:04.422
Well, I've heard what some are anyhow,

48:04.506 --> 48:06.465
and I have bonded a few.

48:06.550 --> 48:08.676
I'm a Dolly, bred and buttered,

48:08.760 --> 48:12.054
and that's how l know Dad's dead.

48:18.228 --> 48:19.562
How old are you?

48:19.646 --> 48:21.147
1 7.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.949
You know, uh, your daddy
was short on his bond.

48:32.034 --> 48:35.369
This house and stuff here
couldn't cover it, not nearly.

48:35.454 --> 48:37.580
D'you know that?

48:37.664 --> 48:39.707
I didn't know nothin'.
They told me everything after.

48:39.791 --> 48:42.835
Well, he was short on his bond,

48:42.961 --> 48:45.129
but then this fella comes
in the office one evening,

48:45.213 --> 48:46.964
got him a sack full of crinkled money

48:47.049 --> 48:50.259
and just laid it down right there,
covered the rest.

48:50.344 --> 48:54.347
Seemed like somebody
needed him sprung in a hurry.

48:54.431 --> 48:56.098
This fella with the money have a name?

48:56.183 --> 48:57.975
Shit, no.

48:58.018 --> 48:59.977
Probably left that in his other pants.

49:08.111 --> 49:11.572
How long before we get
kicked off our own property?

49:11.657 --> 49:14.617
l reckon--

49:14.701 --> 49:16.827
l reckon you all got this place
about another week.

49:16.912 --> 49:18.371
That's my guess.

49:18.455 --> 49:19.789
A week?

49:19.873 --> 49:21.582
And there ain't nothing l can do?

49:21.667 --> 49:22.875
Nope.

49:23.001 --> 49:24.377
Ain't nothing left to do...

49:26.004 --> 49:28.464
unless you can prove he's dead.

49:37.182 --> 49:41.560
Catfish, Blond, you boys
staying out of trouble?

51:24.498 --> 51:26.749
Thump Milton!

51:29.586 --> 51:31.837
I need to talk to you!

51:33.840 --> 51:36.175
Thump Milton.

51:37.969 --> 51:40.221
Thump Milton!

51:41.848 --> 51:42.932
Thump!

52:17.968 --> 52:19.426
I told you to leave him be.

52:25.725 --> 52:27.309
- Get her, Alice.

52:27.394 --> 52:29.228
No, you don't.

52:38.488 --> 52:40.406
That's what you get for not listening to me.

53:07.934 --> 53:11.312
You was warned.

53:11.396 --> 53:14.356
You was warned nice,
and you wouldn't listen.

53:15.775 --> 53:17.151
Why didn't you listen?

53:40.175 --> 53:43.552
What are we ever going to do
with you, baby girl?

53:44.971 --> 53:46.639
Kill me, I guess.

53:53.772 --> 53:55.731
That idea has been said already.

53:57.108 --> 53:58.651
Got any others?

53:58.735 --> 54:00.986
Help me.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.322
Ain't nobody said
that idea yet, have they?

54:05.283 --> 54:08.118
I tried to help you some before.

54:08.203 --> 54:10.120
This is what come of it.

54:33.812 --> 54:36.897
You got somethin' to say,
child, you best say it now.

54:45.615 --> 54:51.537
I got two kids
that can't feed themselves yet.

54:51.621 --> 54:56.208
My mom's sick,
and she's always gonna be sick.

54:58.336 --> 55:01.338
Pretty soon the laws are coming
and taking our house

55:01.381 --> 55:04.675
and throwing us out to live
in the field like dogs.

55:08.847 --> 55:14.643
If Dad has done wrong, Dad has paid,

55:14.728 --> 55:17.187
and whoever killed him,
I don't need to know all that.

55:20.358 --> 55:23.736
But I can't forever carry them kids...

55:23.820 --> 55:27.448
and my mom,

55:27.532 --> 55:29.241
not without that house.

55:42.380 --> 55:44.089
Oh, shit.

55:46.468 --> 55:49.261
I ain't gonna stand here naked
when that motherfucker comes in.

56:04.402 --> 56:06.278
Where is she?

56:06.404 --> 56:09.073
Don't get all excited, Teardrop.

56:09.157 --> 56:11.533
She was warned, and more than once.

56:16.623 --> 56:17.831
You hit her?

56:17.916 --> 56:19.750
He never.

56:22.545 --> 56:25.714
No man here touched that crazy girl.

56:25.799 --> 56:27.716
I put the hurt on her,

56:27.801 --> 56:29.093
me and my sisters.

56:29.177 --> 56:30.719
They was here, too.

56:47.362 --> 56:48.946
What Jessup done was against our ways.

56:49.030 --> 56:50.447
He knew it, I know it,

56:50.532 --> 56:53.659
and I ain't raised no stink at all
about whatever became of him.

56:56.454 --> 56:58.205
But she ain't my brother.

57:07.173 --> 57:08.882
She's about all
the close family I got left,

57:08.967 --> 57:11.677
so I'll be collecting her now

57:11.761 --> 57:14.012
and carrying her on out of here to home.

57:14.097 --> 57:15.472
That suit you, Thump?

57:20.395 --> 57:22.479
You're gonna stand for her, are you?

57:22.522 --> 57:24.481
If she does wrong, you can put it on me.

57:32.866 --> 57:35.242
She's now yours to answer for.

57:40.081 --> 57:43.292
This is a girl
who ain't gonna tell nobody nothing.

57:51.426 --> 57:52.676
You boys give him a hand.

57:52.760 --> 57:54.803
Go on, put her in his truck.

58:50.443 --> 58:52.819
Chomp down on that
till the blood lets up.

59:01.079 --> 59:03.497
Your daddy couldn't face this last bust,

59:03.581 --> 59:05.832
couldn't face a 1 0-year jolt.

59:08.670 --> 59:11.004
He started talking to that fucking sheriff.

59:15.927 --> 59:17.469
You own me now.

59:17.595 --> 59:19.096
Understand?

59:22.600 --> 59:25.060
They been waiting to see
if I'll do anything.

59:26.980 --> 59:28.230
Watching.

59:31.401 --> 59:34.611
I can't know for a certain fact
who went and killed my little brother.

59:38.116 --> 59:39.616
Even if you find out,

59:39.701 --> 59:42.202
you can't ever let me know who killed him.

59:45.331 --> 59:49.001
Knowing that would just mean
I'd be toes up myself pretty soon.

59:51.504 --> 59:52.838
Deal?

1:00:17.905 --> 1:00:19.656
No, get out of the-- open the door.

1:00:19.741 --> 1:00:21.450
- What? What's happened??
- Go on. Watch out.

1:00:35.590 --> 1:00:37.424
Gonna burn.

1:00:39.344 --> 1:00:42.179
Squeeze my hand.

1:01:05.703 --> 1:01:07.204
Thank you.

1:01:14.796 --> 1:01:16.505
l just heard.

1:01:19.509 --> 1:01:21.259
I brought these over for you.

1:01:22.845 --> 1:01:25.222
They're painkillers. They're real strong.

1:01:26.724 --> 1:01:29.184
These are gonna kick in real quick.

1:01:29.268 --> 1:01:31.561
- Start with two.
- Okay.

1:01:31.646 --> 1:01:33.021
She's gonna want more,

1:01:33.106 --> 1:01:34.564
but start with two and build from there,

1:01:34.649 --> 1:01:36.942
whatever number lets her rest.

1:01:37.026 --> 1:01:38.735
Thank you.

1:01:54.043 --> 1:01:56.211
Will you stay until I fall asleep first?

1:01:56.295 --> 1:01:57.754
Yeah, I will.

1:01:57.797 --> 1:02:00.090
But then make sure
they're doing their homework.

1:02:00.174 --> 1:02:01.633
All right.

1:02:41.132 --> 1:02:43.133
Does your arm hurt?

1:02:43.217 --> 1:02:44.843
No.

1:02:44.927 --> 1:02:46.595
Not bad.

1:04:09.303 --> 1:04:13.014
Blond Milton said him and Sonya
would take Sonny in.

1:04:13.099 --> 1:04:14.307
I tell you that?

1:04:16.811 --> 1:04:18.728
Raise him on up from here for me.

1:04:19.897 --> 1:04:22.774
Does he know? Sonny?

1:04:24.402 --> 1:04:25.902
Not from us.

1:04:28.072 --> 1:04:32.492
lf he knows, it's from somebody else
blabbing, 'cause l never.

1:04:34.620 --> 1:04:36.621
He doesn't even know Dad cooks.

1:04:36.706 --> 1:04:39.040
If they took him, that might help some.

1:04:40.167 --> 1:04:41.710
What about Ashlee?

1:04:45.756 --> 1:04:47.632
She don't shine for them.

1:04:52.847 --> 1:04:55.682
Well, what else can you do?

1:04:57.226 --> 1:04:59.936
Beg Victoria and Teardrop
to take Ashlee in.

1:05:02.440 --> 1:05:04.482
God, I hope that ain't
the way it goes, Sweet Pea.

1:05:06.319 --> 1:05:08.361
l hope to hell it ain't.

1:05:15.286 --> 1:05:16.411
It was nice meeting you.

1:05:16.495 --> 1:05:18.038
- Have a good day, okay?
- Thanks.

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:23.376
Hi, how you doing? Sergeant Schalk.

1:05:23.461 --> 1:05:25.128
- Ree Dolly.
- Nice to meet you.

1:05:25.212 --> 1:05:27.464
So what brought you
down here today, Ree?

1:05:27.548 --> 1:05:30.967
Um, I wanted to find out more
about the $40,000 I get for signing up.

1:05:31.052 --> 1:05:32.761
Well, that's a good reason
for joining,

1:05:32.845 --> 1:05:34.554
but why don't you give me
three better reasons for joining?

1:05:34.639 --> 1:05:36.556
Because once you join up,
there's no turning back,

1:05:36.641 --> 1:05:39.225
and it might not be worth
$40,000 dollars to you.

1:05:39.310 --> 1:05:41.394
Well, the main reason
is I need the money.

1:05:41.479 --> 1:05:44.856
It'd be nice to travel, I suppose.

1:05:44.982 --> 1:05:48.568
You know, five years
is a long commitment.

1:05:48.653 --> 1:05:50.153
Well, how long
before l get the money?

1:05:50.237 --> 1:05:52.364
Well, after you sign up,
it would be anywhere

1:05:52.448 --> 1:05:54.074
between 1 4 weeks to 82 weeks.

1:05:54.158 --> 1:05:56.534
Well, how come it doesn't say that
on the poster?

1:05:56.619 --> 1:05:59.454
Probably a clerical error,
or it just wasn't on there.

1:05:59.538 --> 1:06:01.456
It might have been
in fine print at the bottom.

1:06:03.501 --> 1:06:05.335
Do you mind me asking,
what happened to your--

1:06:05.419 --> 1:06:07.003
your eye and your lip?

1:06:07.088 --> 1:06:09.255
l fell off my bike.

1:06:09.340 --> 1:06:10.924
Fell off a bike?

1:06:12.259 --> 1:06:14.386
Well, um, how old are you?

1:06:14.470 --> 1:06:16.596
- 1 7.
- You're 1 7.

1:06:16.681 --> 1:06:19.766
Okay. Now, if this is something
you really wanted to do,

1:06:19.850 --> 1:06:21.893
we'd have to bring Mom and Dad
in on this, okay?

1:06:22.019 --> 1:06:23.311
I can sign for myself.

1:06:23.396 --> 1:06:25.105
Not at 1 7, you can't.

1:06:25.189 --> 1:06:29.651
At 1 7 you're still considered
a minor by the U.S. Government.

1:06:29.735 --> 1:06:31.569
You have to be 1 8 to sign up.

1:06:31.654 --> 1:06:34.072
Would it be a problem
getting Mom and Dad in here?

1:06:34.156 --> 1:06:35.657
l mean, l can come out
to you guys' house--

1:06:35.741 --> 1:06:37.242
My mom is sick.

1:06:37.326 --> 1:06:40.036
My dad's. . . gone.

1:06:40.079 --> 1:06:43.289
Well, do you have any brothers or sisters
that might be able to help?

1:06:43.374 --> 1:06:45.917
I got a little brother
and a little sister, 1 2 and 6.

1:06:46.043 --> 1:06:47.669
Well, who's taking care of them right now?

1:06:47.753 --> 1:06:49.921
- I am.
- You are?

1:06:50.047 --> 1:06:51.631
Is that why you need the $40,000?

1:06:51.716 --> 1:06:53.133
Yes, sir.

1:06:53.217 --> 1:06:56.302
Well, it sounds like
it might be a bigger challenge

1:06:56.387 --> 1:06:57.971
just to stay home, you know,

1:06:58.055 --> 1:06:59.681
and actually take care
of your brother and sister

1:06:59.765 --> 1:07:01.558
because you know you're not
going to be able to take them

1:07:01.642 --> 1:07:03.184
with you to training, right?

1:07:03.269 --> 1:07:05.437
I thought maybe I could.

1:07:05.521 --> 1:07:07.188
Not right at the beginning.

1:07:07.273 --> 1:07:09.441
Plus you wouldn't be able to have them

1:07:09.525 --> 1:07:11.401
when you're actually
in the active duty Army

1:07:11.485 --> 1:07:13.153
because who's going to be
there to take care of them

1:07:13.237 --> 1:07:15.071
if you have to go off and actually fight?

1:07:17.825 --> 1:07:19.200
So it sounds like right now

1:07:19.285 --> 1:07:21.703
you need to buckle up and stay home.

1:07:21.787 --> 1:07:24.122
It's going to take a lot of backbone
and a lot of courage to stay home,

1:07:24.206 --> 1:07:27.792
but that, l think, is what you need to do
right at this point.

1:07:27.877 --> 1:07:29.711
Okay?

1:07:29.795 --> 1:07:32.714
Now, something might change
here in the next year or so.

1:07:32.798 --> 1:07:35.800
You might decide
this is what you want to do, you know?

1:07:35.885 --> 1:07:38.887
But don't take it lightly,
and don't do it just for the money.

1:07:38.971 --> 1:07:40.805
You need to have a good reason
to do this, okay?

1:07:40.890 --> 1:07:42.891
- Okay.
- All right, well, it was nice meeting you.

1:07:42.975 --> 1:07:44.267
Nice meeting you.

1:07:44.351 --> 1:07:45.602
Have a good day, okay?

1:07:45.686 --> 1:07:47.520
Thank you.

1:08:10.211 --> 1:08:12.420
What's going on?

1:08:12.505 --> 1:08:15.131
I'm tired of waiting around
for shit to come down.

1:08:16.884 --> 1:08:18.218
Let's get out and poke 'em
where they're at,

1:08:18.302 --> 1:08:19.844
see what happens.

1:09:08.894 --> 1:09:11.271
Oh, Lord.

1:10:02.698 --> 1:10:04.699
Ray and them are over there.

1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:23.092
Ray.

1:10:23.177 --> 1:10:25.261
What do you want?

1:10:25.304 --> 1:10:26.846
l ain't seen him.

1:10:26.931 --> 1:10:30.558
If I could help you, I would.

1:10:30.643 --> 1:10:33.603
There's certain things you can't do.

1:10:33.687 --> 1:10:35.855
lt's bullshit, this fucking shit, man.

1:10:37.566 --> 1:10:39.984
You're useless as tits on a fucking boar.

1:10:40.069 --> 1:10:42.487
l don't know where he is.

1:10:42.571 --> 1:10:44.030
It's gonna be much worse
next time I come back.

1:10:44.114 --> 1:10:46.950
l'll tell you that right now.

1:10:47.034 --> 1:10:49.869
Best thing you can do
is leave it alone, brother.

1:10:49.954 --> 1:10:52.413
Believe me.
You come back up in here,

1:10:52.498 --> 1:10:54.540
you gonna get you an ass whoopin'
that won't quit.

1:10:54.625 --> 1:10:56.292
Oh, yeah?

1:10:56.335 --> 1:10:59.170
Look what the fuck
this shit already caused.

1:11:02.383 --> 1:11:04.467
What the hell?

1:11:16.146 --> 1:11:18.815
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

1:11:22.653 --> 1:11:24.404
Hey!

1:11:25.823 --> 1:11:27.949
lt's on now.

1:11:30.077 --> 1:11:32.787
lt's so on.

1:11:32.871 --> 1:11:35.415
We're coming after you, dude.

1:11:35.499 --> 1:11:38.334
We're coming,
and we're bringing hell, too.

1:11:53.600 --> 1:11:56.602
What the hell are we doing?

1:11:56.687 --> 1:11:58.855
Looking for humps that ain't settled.

1:12:22.212 --> 1:12:24.297
Oh, hell.

1:12:28.510 --> 1:12:30.178
He ain't here.

1:12:47.529 --> 1:12:49.447
He ain't anywhere.

1:12:56.038 --> 1:12:57.455
He's somewhere.

1:13:27.319 --> 1:13:29.112
Teardrop.

1:13:29.196 --> 1:13:30.655
You should stop.

1:13:30.739 --> 1:13:32.281
Just see what he wants.

1:13:43.627 --> 1:13:45.211
Shh...

1:14:07.151 --> 1:14:08.526
Get out of the truck, Teardrop.

1:14:08.610 --> 1:14:11.279
I need to talk to you.

1:14:11.363 --> 1:14:13.531
l don't think so.

1:14:13.615 --> 1:14:16.367
lt ain't about you.

1:14:16.493 --> 1:14:17.994
You're not in trouble.

1:14:18.078 --> 1:14:19.579
lt's about your brother.

1:14:19.663 --> 1:14:22.331
Nope.

1:14:22.416 --> 1:14:25.376
Tonight I ain't doin'
a fucking thing you say.

1:14:27.504 --> 1:14:28.754
Get out of the truck.

1:14:28.839 --> 1:14:31.090
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

1:14:31.175 --> 1:14:33.926
Come on, get out.

1:14:35.804 --> 1:14:37.597
Why'd you tell?

1:14:40.267 --> 1:14:41.893
Why?

1:14:45.814 --> 1:14:47.315
You went and got his ass killed.

1:14:47.399 --> 1:14:48.733
You happy now?

1:14:59.745 --> 1:15:01.412
l know you.

1:15:01.538 --> 1:15:04.707
l know your family.

1:15:04.791 --> 1:15:06.209
Get out of the car now.

1:15:24.186 --> 1:15:25.853
Is this gonna be our time?

1:16:03.141 --> 1:16:04.642
What I really can't stand

1:16:04.726 --> 1:16:09.438
is why I feel so ashamed for Dad.

1:16:09.523 --> 1:16:12.233
Well, he loved you all.

1:16:13.902 --> 1:16:15.820
That's where he went weak.

1:16:18.991 --> 1:16:20.199
Lots of us can be tough,

1:16:20.284 --> 1:16:21.701
plenty tough enough,

1:16:21.785 --> 1:16:24.287
and do it for a long stretch, too.

1:16:25.872 --> 1:16:27.665
But snitching.

1:16:27.749 --> 1:16:31.252
For lots and lots 'a years he wasn't.

1:16:31.336 --> 1:16:34.380
He wasn't, he wasn't,
and one day he was.

1:16:56.153 --> 1:16:58.404
You always have scared me.

1:17:00.657 --> 1:17:02.116
That's 'cause you're smart.

1:17:21.762 --> 1:17:23.596
Will you look through this stuff?

1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:25.097
See what you want to keep?

1:17:34.107 --> 1:17:35.441
That's Dad.

1:17:35.525 --> 1:17:37.610
And Teardrop.

1:17:41.198 --> 1:17:43.783
Ashlee, you remember
when Dad made that for you?

1:17:43.867 --> 1:17:45.159
Mm-hm.

1:17:48.955 --> 1:17:50.998
Look at this guy with her.

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:52.249
That's him?

1:17:52.334 --> 1:17:53.376
Mm-hm.

1:17:53.460 --> 1:17:55.586
How old was he in that picture?

1:17:55.712 --> 1:17:57.129
Probably around my age.

1:18:19.403 --> 1:18:22.363
"I don't know how l ever
latched on to someone like you,

1:18:22.447 --> 1:18:27.159
"but I sure hope I can keep
you interested in me forever.

1:18:27.244 --> 1:18:29.995
l love you and will always be true."

1:18:57.983 --> 1:18:59.608
Ha! Found ya.

1:18:59.693 --> 1:19:01.527
Found ya!

1:19:48.575 --> 1:19:51.535
We're goin' to fix your problem for you.

1:19:51.620 --> 1:19:54.455
Right now I'm feeling
like blowing me a clean hole

1:19:54.539 --> 1:19:56.415
through your fucking guts.

1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:57.666
I know you do,

1:19:57.751 --> 1:19:59.418
but you won't.

1:19:59.503 --> 1:20:02.129
You'll put that scatter gun
away and come along with us.

1:20:03.381 --> 1:20:06.091
You must think I'm crazy.

1:20:06.176 --> 1:20:09.178
We'll take you to your daddy's bones.

1:20:09.262 --> 1:20:11.138
We know the place.

1:20:15.519 --> 1:20:18.896
We need to put a stop
to all this nonsense talk

1:20:18.980 --> 1:20:21.941
about us we've been having to hear.

1:20:22.025 --> 1:20:23.943
I ain't said a thing about you.

1:20:24.027 --> 1:20:27.154
I know, but everybody else has.

1:20:27.239 --> 1:20:28.989
l'm bringing this.

1:20:29.074 --> 1:20:31.325
No, you won't bring that, either.

1:20:31.409 --> 1:20:35.162
You want his bones,
you'll set that down and come along.

1:21:04.776 --> 1:21:07.027
You go on and take that sack off now.

1:21:08.697 --> 1:21:10.573
Give it to me.

1:21:16.621 --> 1:21:18.914
Child, you might know where you are.

1:21:18.999 --> 1:21:21.041
If you do, you forget you know it.

1:21:21.126 --> 1:21:22.501
You get me?

1:22:48.421 --> 1:22:52.091
He should be right there.

1:22:52.175 --> 1:22:56.387
You're gonna need to reach down
and tug him up.

1:23:13.029 --> 1:23:14.905
He ain't deep.

1:23:24.457 --> 1:23:25.749
Straight down.

1:23:25.834 --> 1:23:27.376
Can you feel of him?

1:23:53.486 --> 1:23:55.320
All right, now.

1:23:55.405 --> 1:23:57.448
- Here, take this.
- What?

1:23:57.532 --> 1:23:59.908
- How else you gonna get his hands?
- No.

1:23:59.993 --> 1:24:02.661
- Oh, come on, child.
- No.

1:24:02.746 --> 1:24:04.204
Your daddy would want you to do this.

1:24:04.289 --> 1:24:06.582
Now, here, take the saw.

1:24:12.881 --> 1:24:14.548
She can't do it, Merab.

1:24:22.599 --> 1:24:25.100
Hold his arm out straight, child.

1:24:30.190 --> 1:24:32.107
Shit.

1:25:02.889 --> 1:25:05.015
Why'd you let go?

1:25:05.141 --> 1:25:06.642
You're gonna need both hands,

1:25:06.726 --> 1:25:10.187
or sure as shit they'll say he cut one off
to keep from going to prison.

1:25:10.271 --> 1:25:12.439
They know that trick.
Now reach back down in there, now, quick.

1:26:04.868 --> 1:26:06.535
There you go.

1:26:16.754 --> 1:26:18.714
Let's go, Alice.

1:26:35.356 --> 1:26:37.566
Christian County 1 36,

1:26:37.650 --> 1:26:40.903
that thing comes back
to a P.O. Box address out of Cassville.

1:26:40.987 --> 1:26:44.323
The owner appears to be
a relative of the female

1:26:44.407 --> 1:26:46.158
who is taking care of the kids.

1:26:46.242 --> 1:26:48.368
Christian County to 1 60.

1:26:48.453 --> 1:26:49.786
Got it.

1:26:58.004 --> 1:26:59.713
Come on back.

1:27:13.311 --> 1:27:14.645
Oh.

1:27:16.898 --> 1:27:18.899
How in the hell did you come by these?

1:27:18.983 --> 1:27:21.902
Someone flung them
up on the porch last night.

1:27:28.451 --> 1:27:30.535
Reckon l'll run these straight over.

1:27:30.620 --> 1:27:32.871
The lab can tell me if they're his.

1:27:32.956 --> 1:27:34.206
They're his.

1:27:34.290 --> 1:27:37.042
Those are my dad's hands.

1:27:37.126 --> 1:27:39.127
We'll know yes or no
on that soon enough.

1:27:41.381 --> 1:27:45.342
l bet your dad would still be here
if he was just growing his marijuana.

1:27:47.220 --> 1:27:48.762
Hey.

1:27:48.846 --> 1:27:51.723
I didn't shoot the other night
'cause you were there in the truck.

1:27:53.351 --> 1:27:55.018
He never backed me down.

1:27:58.648 --> 1:28:00.816
It looked to me like he did.

1:28:00.900 --> 1:28:02.943
Don't you let me hear
that's the story getting around.

1:28:03.027 --> 1:28:07.072
I don't talk about you, man, ever.

1:28:48.114 --> 1:28:49.656
You're a good boy.

1:28:53.369 --> 1:28:54.953
Good boy.

1:29:04.255 --> 1:29:06.548
Thank you.

1:29:06.632 --> 1:29:09.134
Clip. Thank you.

1:29:27.487 --> 1:29:28.820
Sonny.

1:29:30.156 --> 1:29:31.990
Hey, Ashlee.

1:29:34.243 --> 1:29:36.161
I brung these for you two to raise up.

1:29:43.044 --> 1:29:44.795
Thank you.

1:29:50.885 --> 1:29:52.594
What's he doing here?

1:29:52.678 --> 1:29:55.055
I have no idea.

1:29:58.226 --> 1:30:00.018
l know you.

1:30:00.103 --> 1:30:02.270
Yep.

1:30:02.355 --> 1:30:04.981
Looks like you earned
this money with blood, kid.

1:30:08.486 --> 1:30:11.113
- That's yours.
- How's it mine?

1:30:11.197 --> 1:30:13.073
Well, that feller never did give a name,

1:30:13.157 --> 1:30:17.953
but he sure was good news for you all
when he put that down on Jessup.

1:30:18.037 --> 1:30:19.246
Ain't it still his, though?

1:30:21.124 --> 1:30:23.834
You can use it
a hell of a lot more than him.

1:30:23.918 --> 1:30:25.252
He ain't gonna come back for it, neither,

1:30:25.336 --> 1:30:27.045
not the way things happened.

1:30:27.130 --> 1:30:31.925
We took our cut,
and that there's what's left.

1:30:32.009 --> 1:30:34.177
That makes it yours.

1:30:36.180 --> 1:30:37.889
I don't know how you did that.

1:30:37.974 --> 1:30:40.684
Bred and buttered. I told you.

1:30:43.479 --> 1:30:44.896
Well, you take care, okay?

1:31:08.921 --> 1:31:10.255
Here.

1:31:10.339 --> 1:31:12.883
Yeah.

1:31:12.967 --> 1:31:14.843
Well, it's been a long time.

1:31:17.346 --> 1:31:20.182
Back off a little.
You're making me nervous.

1:31:22.143 --> 1:31:23.518
Oh, shit.

1:31:51.339 --> 1:31:53.632
Hm.

1:32:00.097 --> 1:32:02.349
I was never good like your daddy was.

1:32:16.072 --> 1:32:17.447
l know who.

1:32:17.573 --> 1:32:19.574
What?

1:32:24.580 --> 1:32:26.122
Jessup.

1:32:27.500 --> 1:32:28.833
l know who.

1:32:34.006 --> 1:32:35.340
You should have this.

1:32:40.596 --> 1:32:42.430
Oh, no, you--

1:32:42.515 --> 1:32:45.267
Why don't you keep it here for me?

1:33:27.393 --> 1:33:30.103
Does that money mean you're leaving?

1:33:30.187 --> 1:33:32.814
l ain't leaving you guys.
Why do you think that?

1:33:35.318 --> 1:33:37.277
We heard you talking about the Army.

1:33:43.326 --> 1:33:45.577
Are you wanting to leave us?

1:33:46.871 --> 1:33:50.040
I'd be lost without
the weight of you two on my back.

1:33:52.668 --> 1:33:54.502
