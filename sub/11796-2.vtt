( bell rings )

00:04.170 --> 00:06.740
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.773 --> 00:09.609
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.642 --> 00:12.412
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.445 --> 00:15.749
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>

00:15.782 --> 00:21.588
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.621 --> 00:24.691
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.724 --> 00:27.627
<i>* And my dog ate</i>

00:27.660 --> 00:30.697

00:34.334 --> 00:38.838

00:58.425 --> 01:02.796
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:12.472 --> 01:15.508
Zack: <i>Starting today,</i>
<i>this is where I work.</i>

01:15.542 --> 01:17.277
<i>Pretty nice office, huh?</i>

01:17.310 --> 01:19.212
<i>You see, the whole gang</i>
<i>landed summer jobs</i>

01:19.245 --> 01:22.482
<i>at the Malibu Sands Beach Club</i>
<i>with a little help from Lisa,</i>

01:22.515 --> 01:24.417
<i>whose parents</i>
<i>are club members.</i>

01:24.451 --> 01:27.654
<i>Oh. Girls on the beach,</i>
<i>fun in the sun,</i>

01:27.687 --> 01:31.224
<i>money in my pocket...</i>
<i>This is going to be</i>
<i>the best summer ever.</i>

01:32.258 --> 01:34.527
I've owned this club
for 15 years.

01:34.561 --> 01:37.731
So I know exactly what you
new employees expect.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.600
Girls on the beach,
fun in the sun,

01:40.633 --> 01:42.602
money in your pocket.

01:42.635 --> 01:45.905
You think this is going to be
the best summer ever.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.208
Boy, this guy's really sharp.

01:48.241 --> 01:50.510
Well, you can forget it.

01:50.543 --> 01:54.180
You're here to work
from the moment
you punch in...

01:54.214 --> 01:57.384
- Good morning Mr. Carosi.
- Hello, Mrs. Henderson.

01:57.417 --> 02:00.120
My! What a gorgeous outfit.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.658
...to the minute
you punch out.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.494
And don't forget our motto,

02:07.527 --> 02:09.763
"The members
are always right."

02:09.795 --> 02:12.899
Excuse me, what if a member
says the earth is flat?

02:12.932 --> 02:15.435
Do we correct him
or do we just let it go?

02:16.903 --> 02:19.239
Don't mind him.
His head is flat.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.908
- Who are you?
- Oh, Zack Morris.

02:21.941 --> 02:24.678
- I'm your new head waiter.
- Really?

02:24.711 --> 02:28.515
I think someone like you is
more suited for
Social Director.

02:28.548 --> 02:31.985
Social Director?
Sounds good. What do I do?

02:32.085 --> 02:34.688
If a member
wants a chair, you get it.

02:34.721 --> 02:36.690
If a member's kid
wants to bury you

02:36.723 --> 02:40.226
in the sand,
start digging. Get it?

02:40.260 --> 02:42.529
- Do they tip you for that?
- They never have,

02:42.562 --> 02:44.764
but maybe
you'll get lucky.

02:47.534 --> 02:48.902
We hired you
as a lifeguard?

02:48.935 --> 02:50.970
I'm a senior lifesaver,
Mr. Carosi.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.972
But you're
a little bit of a thing.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.474
'Round here we
save our shrimps

02:54.507 --> 02:56.976
for cocktails.
( laughs )

02:57.010 --> 02:59.813
Hey, Mr. Carosi,
Kelly is a terrific swimmer.

02:59.846 --> 03:03.717
- She'll be great.
- Did I ask you, beef boy?

03:04.284 --> 03:05.285
No.

03:05.318 --> 03:07.821
If you don't want
to hire Kelly as a lifeguard

03:07.854 --> 03:10.757
just because she's a woman,
that's discrimination.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.460
You like to throw
your two cents in, don't you?

03:13.493 --> 03:16.429
Boy, you have no idea.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.598
All right.
We'll hire you as a lifeguard.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.633
You won't regret
that decision, sir.

03:20.667 --> 03:25.572
Chat, chat, chat.
You're gonna need
sunblock for that tongue.

03:25.605 --> 03:28.508
Okay, we'll try you
as a receptionist.

03:28.541 --> 03:32.846
We'll see how that
big mouth handles
all the members' complaints.

03:32.879 --> 03:36.516
One question, sir.
My birthday is Saturday.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.886
Can I leave
a little before 8:00?
Say, 4:30?

03:39.919 --> 03:42.522
Sure, and if you do

03:42.555 --> 03:44.557
you're fired.

03:44.591 --> 03:46.526
Now, get to work!

03:47.460 --> 03:49.596
I think he likes you, Zack.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.869
Excuse me.
Let me help you with that.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.837
It's a new service
of the club.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.340
- Can you do me next?
- Oh, why wait?

04:00.373 --> 04:02.542
I have two hands.

04:02.575 --> 04:04.644
Oh, boy!

04:05.812 --> 04:07.847
...and thank you.
Enjoy your stay.

04:07.881 --> 04:10.350
Hey, Screech.
Could you run
into the Sand Cafe

04:10.383 --> 04:12.452
and get me and Kelly
a couple of sodas?

04:12.485 --> 04:15.622
Certainly. We have cream soda,
club soda, orange soda,
diet cola,

04:15.655 --> 04:18.757
- cherry cola, ginger ale...
- Just a couple
of waters, okay?

04:18.791 --> 04:22.429
- All right.
Spring, tonic, sparkling...
- Regular water, Screech.

04:22.462 --> 04:25.799
- Cool, cold, or warm?
- Get out of here!

04:25.832 --> 04:28.068
Hey, babe, are you
the new lifeguard?

04:28.068 --> 04:30.070
Yeah, but the name is Kelly.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.441
So what do you gotta do
to get a little
mouth-to-mouth?

04:34.474 --> 04:37.777
Try drowning.
Excuse me, I have to
concentrate on the swimmers.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.649
Ms. Kapowski, could I have
a word with you?

04:42.682 --> 04:44.317
Yes, sir.

04:47.087 --> 04:49.556
- Don't flirt
with the members.
- But I was...

04:49.589 --> 04:52.726
- Oh,
Norman, how are the folks?
- They're great, sir.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.131
That is so unfair.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.634
That goon was
hitting on me and Carosi
acted like it was my fault.

05:01.668 --> 05:04.037
Hey, Slater, did you want
crushed ice, shaved ice,

05:04.070 --> 05:05.872
or no ice
with that water?

05:10.577 --> 05:13.847
Good day, sir.
My name is Samuel
and I'll be your waiter.

05:13.880 --> 05:16.416
Screech, it's me.
I don't need a menu.

05:16.449 --> 05:18.518
I know that, Zack,
but I need the practice.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.820
Please take the menu.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.757
Fine. I'll have a Coke.

05:24.858 --> 05:27.060
Hi, Zack.
May I join you?

05:27.093 --> 05:29.529
- Sure, Lisa.
- Oh, allow me.

05:32.532 --> 05:35.702
Thank you... I think.

05:35.735 --> 05:37.804
Now, may I tell you
today's specials?

05:37.837 --> 05:41.374
We have linguini, fettuccini,
or eenie-meanie tortellini.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.478
- I'll have a salad.
- Mixed or greeny?

05:45.512 --> 05:47.580
- Greeny.
- Large or teeny.

05:49.416 --> 05:51.785
Will you get out of here,
you wienie!

06:00.460 --> 06:04.497
Why, hello, Mrs. Holmes.
Lovely to see you.
You're looking fit.

06:05.799 --> 06:09.536
- Hi, Mr. Carosi.
- Lisa, lovely to see you.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.706
- What are you doing here?
- I'm on my lunch break, sir.

06:12.739 --> 06:14.741
The dining room
is for members only.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.943
Oh, but Zack is my friend,
Mr. Carosi.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.045
I'd like to have lunch
with him.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.082
Well, far be it from me
to displease a member.

06:22.115 --> 06:23.717
I miss seeing your parents.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.118
I know they're busy surgeons,

06:25.151 --> 06:27.654
but it's a joy watching them
cut their meat.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.191
Never eat here again.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.962
( phone rings )

06:37.063 --> 06:38.798
Hello?
Beach Club.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.800
I'll connect you.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.870
- That's no way to
answer the phone.
- ( phone rings )

06:43.903 --> 06:46.439
I'll show you how it's done.

06:46.473 --> 06:49.509
Hello? This is
the Malibu Sands Beach Club.

06:49.542 --> 06:53.146
We are having a beautiful day
and I hope you are t...

06:54.714 --> 06:56.983
No, we don't give
family discounts.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.154
Not even to you, Mom.

07:01.187 --> 07:03.923
What are you staring at?
Get back to work.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.032
Hi. What's the latest
on Zack's surprise party?

07:12.065 --> 07:14.801
It's on.
My parents' beach house,
Friday at midnight.

07:14.834 --> 07:17.937
Technically, 1 2:01 a.m.,
the first minute
of Zack's birthday.

07:18.038 --> 07:21.107
It's perfect.
He'll be so primed for
something Saturday night,

07:21.141 --> 07:22.909
he'll never guess this.

07:22.942 --> 07:25.779
We can get the place ready
when we move in
with you tonight.

07:25.812 --> 07:28.481
You're so nice to let us
stay with you this summer.

07:28.515 --> 07:30.650
Aw, well I've always
wanted sisters.

07:30.684 --> 07:33.586
Now that the party's set,
we better start
inviting everyone.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.855
Yeah, but don't tell
Screech yet.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.625
He's such a blabber mouth,
we might as well tell Zack.

07:38.658 --> 07:39.926
Shh! Here he comes.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.628
Our break's over, huh, Kelly?

07:41.661 --> 07:44.097
- Better get
back to the beach.
- Yeah, great idea.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.567
Bye, Jessie.
Bye, Zack.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.736
- How's it going, Zack?
- Oh, not great.

07:49.769 --> 07:53.640
Carosi's a real pain.
Maybe working here
wasn't a good idea.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.013
I take that back.

08:01.681 --> 08:03.750
Hi, there.
Can I help you?

08:03.783 --> 08:05.785
Maybe. I'm looking
for someone...

08:05.819 --> 08:08.822
Oh, aren't we all,
and sometimes we get lucky

08:08.855 --> 08:11.691
and find that someone
we're looking for.

08:11.725 --> 08:13.760
That's so profound.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.830
I'm looking for Leon Carosi.

08:16.863 --> 08:18.832
What do you want
to see that jerk for?

08:18.865 --> 08:21.601
Because that jerk's
my father.

08:23.603 --> 08:25.739
Oh.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.707
I was just kidding.
Guess what?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.776
You're on
<i>Totally Hidden Video.</i>

09:06.613 --> 09:09.883
How can you get up to run
at 6:00 in the morning?

09:09.916 --> 09:12.318
Easy, your snoring
woke me up at 5:00.

09:13.453 --> 09:16.089
It sounded like there was
a pig under the bed.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.226
Did you have to whistle
the theme from <i>Rocky</i>

09:20.260 --> 09:22.162
while you were putting
on your sweats?

09:22.195 --> 09:24.931
Some people
are so <i>inconsiderato.</i>

09:25.031 --> 09:27.667
And some people
are such slobs.

09:27.701 --> 09:29.135
Do you do that at home?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.538
Oh, I see.
I have a summer mommy.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.308
Who belongs to this mess?

09:35.342 --> 09:38.478
Messy Jessie.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.948
Do me a favor.
Clean up you act,
then clean up the bathroom.

09:43.683 --> 09:46.686
Morning. Can we offer
you ladies a ride to the club?

09:46.720 --> 09:49.155
- Oh, thanks guys.
- But first,

09:49.189 --> 09:52.292
- what do you
say to breakfast?
- Great idea. Where?

09:52.325 --> 09:55.628
Here, Mama.
Get in that kitchen
and make me some French toast.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.200
I don't do French toast.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.202
Oh.
Bacon and eggs will be fine.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.436
Make my eggs scrambled.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.071
And if you don't shut up

10:05.105 --> 10:08.241
I'm gonna scramble you
into a dork omelet.

10:08.274 --> 10:12.312
Zack, we heard you really
blew it with Carosi's
daughter yesterday.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.115
Yeah. The word is,
you needed a shoehorn

10:15.148 --> 10:17.217
to get your foot
out of your mouth.

10:18.151 --> 10:20.320
Just wait.
By the end of the day,

10:20.353 --> 10:23.390
Ms. Carosi will be
eating out of my hand.

10:23.423 --> 10:25.091
Kelly: Oh, yeah right.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.827
This is my daughter, Stacy.
She just flew
in from New York,

10:27.861 --> 10:31.197
where she goes to school.
Stacy is now
the assistant manager

10:31.231 --> 10:34.834
and in charge of
the summer help.
Stacy, they're all yours.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.070
Thank you, Dad.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.271
Great.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.407
We're working for a woman.

10:41.374 --> 10:43.710
Excuse me.

10:43.743 --> 10:46.379
Would you like
to share your comment?

10:46.413 --> 10:50.283
Well, I was just saying
it's great
working for a woman.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.785
We'll get along better
if you don't

10:51.818 --> 10:54.821
think of me as a woman,
but as your boss.

10:54.854 --> 10:58.425
How about as
one boss woman?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.363
I'm sorry.
You see I'm from
the east coast.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.699
Was that
California humor, dude?

11:05.732 --> 11:08.601
Were you being
awesome and gnarly?

11:10.570 --> 11:12.572
I was just trying
to make a joke.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.674
Well, next time try harder.

11:14.708 --> 11:18.378
Now, listen up.
A club is only as
good as its staff,

11:18.411 --> 11:21.348
so I demand
that you be the best.

11:21.381 --> 11:24.651
As long as that's clear
we won't have any problems.

11:25.819 --> 11:29.889
Any more quips for us, dude?

11:29.923 --> 11:34.527
Uh... No, not right now,
Ms. Carosi.

11:37.430 --> 11:40.500
Well, you sure got her
eating out of
your hand, Preppie.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.417
Okay, Courtney, why don't
we just practice serves?

11:57.450 --> 11:59.519
- Go for it.
- I don't know how to do it.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.721
Okay, I'll show you how.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.824
Right over there.

12:04.858 --> 12:08.228
Give me the ball.
Now, you take the ball

12:08.261 --> 12:10.263
and you put it
in your left hand.

12:10.296 --> 12:12.766
Like so. Okay?
Hold it right there.

12:12.799 --> 12:16.503
Take your right arm and you
bring it back,
nice and smooth.

12:16.536 --> 12:18.538
Nice and smooth.
Smooth.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.907
Okay, that's smooth enough.

12:20.940 --> 12:22.275
Hey, you want to join us?

12:22.308 --> 12:24.144
No, but won't you join me?

12:24.177 --> 12:27.414
Practice. Girls, practice.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.849
You listen up, bud.
You are not being paid

12:29.883 --> 12:32.786
- to party with the members.
- I am a Social Director.

12:32.819 --> 12:35.822
Can't get more social
than that.

12:35.855 --> 12:38.258
What is it with you
California guys?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.493
Too much sun
bleaches the brain?

12:40.527 --> 12:43.530
Let me make it clear.
I catch you
goofing off with the girls

12:43.563 --> 12:45.699
one more time
and you're out of here.

12:45.732 --> 12:49.569
Stacy... Stacy, wouldn't you
enjoy your job more
if you lightened up?

12:49.602 --> 12:52.505
- I mean, it's the summer...
- Look, airhead...

12:52.539 --> 12:56.509
I'm not interested in
lightening up, or chilling out
or hanging ten, okay?

12:56.543 --> 13:00.747
I've got a job to do,
and my job is to make sure
you do your job right.

13:02.682 --> 13:04.651
Yes, sir.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.357
Yes, and I want the cake
to say "Happy Birthday, Zack."

13:12.058 --> 13:14.194
No. Zack.

13:14.227 --> 13:17.464
Z. A. C...

13:17.497 --> 13:20.934
By the sea.
Our beach club is by the sea.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.635
Good job, Jessie.

13:22.669 --> 13:24.938
And if they're looking
for a different beach club

13:24.971 --> 13:27.240
give them
the wrong directions.

13:27.273 --> 13:30.276
Mrs. Axlerod,
love that new hair color.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.279
- It matches the ocean.
- ( giggles )

13:35.715 --> 13:38.818
Still there?
Okay, let's try again.

13:38.852 --> 13:41.421
Happy Birthday Zack.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.490
Z. A...

13:44.758 --> 13:46.726
A wrong number.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.863
- I have had it.
- What's wrong?

13:49.896 --> 13:53.333
I took this job so I could
get a car and meet some girls,

13:53.366 --> 13:55.468
but I'm just getting hassled
by Mr. Carosi

13:55.502 --> 13:57.470
and his little
stuck-up daughter.

13:57.504 --> 14:00.473
I love my job.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.575
- Is all that money from tips?
- Yep.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.211
One lady gave me five bucks
just to go away.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.550
Too bad Mr. Carosi won't
let you be a waiter, Zack.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.886
The real money's
in food service.

14:12.919 --> 14:15.255
Screech, if I can't
get near the money,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.757
I'll bring the money to me,
and you're gonna help.

14:17.791 --> 14:21.294
- I am.
- Mm-hmm.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.830
Jessie,
I've got to talk to you
about Zack's party.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.566
Everything's under control
and everyone's been invited.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.068
Call them back.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.437
I forget to ask my parents if
I could use the beach house.

14:30.470 --> 14:33.406
They're throwing a party there
themselves this Friday.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.076
Lisa, how could you
forget something like that?

14:36.076 --> 14:39.746
Hey,
I'm beautiful, I'm charming,
I'm always in fashion.

14:39.779 --> 14:43.283
You can't expect me to worry
about minor details, too.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.491
Whoa! Check out
those dolls.

14:51.524 --> 14:54.527
Slater, you should be
more serious about your job.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.996
I have never been
more serious.

14:57.964 --> 15:00.400
Hot dogs!
Right this way!

15:00.433 --> 15:03.536
Get your hot dogs!
Half the price
of the Sand Cafe

15:03.570 --> 15:06.573
and twice the taste!
Hot dogs!

15:06.606 --> 15:09.542
Right this way!
Get your hot dogs!

15:10.877 --> 15:14.280
All right. Keep it up,
Mr. Wiener.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.384
Hot dogs!
Get your hot dogs here!
Right here!

15:17.417 --> 15:19.552
Hello there, Mr. Grossi.

15:19.586 --> 15:21.488
Carosi. What are you doing?

15:21.521 --> 15:24.057
Just trying to make a little
extra money on my lunch break.

15:24.057 --> 15:26.426
You're stealing business
from my dining room.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.661
Really?

15:28.695 --> 15:31.064
Well, you see,
your property line
ends right there,

15:31.097 --> 15:33.366
and this
is a public beach,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.402
so I guess
I'm within my rights.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.771
Now of course,
I might not
need a little extra

15:37.804 --> 15:40.940
if I were earning
as much as... Say...

15:40.974 --> 15:43.977
- A waiter.
- Okay.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.546
Okay, I'll try you
out as a waiter,

15:46.579 --> 15:48.982
but mess up just once
and you're through.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.418
No one crosses
Leon Carosi.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.988
Zack, you gotta help me
get out of this suit!

15:55.088 --> 15:57.891
There's a herd of fat kids
trying to barbecue me!

16:05.632 --> 16:07.901
Here you are.
Enjoy your lunch.

16:07.934 --> 16:10.437
Thank you, young man.
You're a wonderful waiter.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.605
Thank you.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.344
Mrs. Mancuso,

16:17.377 --> 16:21.348
a free desert in honor
of your 20th birthday.

16:21.381 --> 16:25.051
Come on, Zack.
We both know I'm 25.

16:28.188 --> 16:32.158
Oh... Oh. Let me get that
for you, girls. Here we are.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.327
Thanks.
Here's your tip.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.963
Oh, you are very generous.

16:37.063 --> 16:40.266
And I've got a tip for
you two lovely ladies,
I'm free tonight.

16:47.207 --> 16:51.077
Ms. Carosi,
I'd advise you to leave
before your dad has a cow.

16:51.111 --> 16:53.146
Employees are not allowed
to dine with the members.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.648
Those rules don't apply
to the boss's daughter.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.684
- ( scoffs )
- Now, may I have a menu?

16:57.717 --> 17:00.020
Why, certainly.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.223
There you go.

17:03.256 --> 17:05.224
Now, what about
the specials?

17:05.258 --> 17:07.460
A lot of girls think
I'm pretty special.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.930
Look, surfer boy,

17:11.031 --> 17:14.267
that wise-guy style
does not suit this club.

17:14.300 --> 17:17.404
Okay... Okay.

17:17.436 --> 17:21.040
We have a rosemary chicken
and a grilled salmon plate.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.144
Well?

17:25.178 --> 17:27.213
Well?

17:27.247 --> 17:30.583
You're supposed to ask me
if I'd like anything to drink.

17:31.518 --> 17:32.686
Excuse me, Ms. Carosi.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.320
Zack, I need to borrow a comb.

17:34.354 --> 17:37.090
I like a waiter
who's concerned
about his appearance.

17:37.123 --> 17:38.958
Here, you can borrow mine.

17:40.326 --> 17:42.629
Thanks.
I'll be right back.

17:42.662 --> 17:45.465
You know, you can learn
a lot from your friend.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.200
At least his
shirt was tucked in.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.268
Oh, give me a break!

17:48.301 --> 17:50.270
Don't use that
tone with me.

17:50.303 --> 17:54.541
If you like Screech so much,
ask him to be your waiter
and I'll go surf.

17:59.346 --> 18:02.449
Thanks. I spilled fettuccini
in Mrs. Mahoney's hair

18:02.482 --> 18:04.617
and I had to comb it out.

18:07.320 --> 18:11.658
It's a shame we can't have
Zack's party right
here at the club.

18:11.691 --> 18:14.494
Why can't we?
The club closes at 10:00.

18:14.527 --> 18:17.597
We could sneak in,
have the party and
clean up afterwards.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.599
- Great idea.
- All right.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.368
That's it! I've had it!

18:21.401 --> 18:24.037
This beach is not big enough
for the both of us.

18:26.072 --> 18:29.175
Let me guess.
Stacy and you
making nice again?

18:31.378 --> 18:34.080
Will you excuse me, please?
I need to speak with him...

18:34.114 --> 18:36.616
- Alone.
- Lisa: Sure.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.123
If you'd like
to keep your job,

18:43.156 --> 18:45.325
you'd better get back
to the dining room.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.662
Okay, but not because
you told me to,

18:49.696 --> 18:52.732
because I need the money.
We can't all be spoiled brats.

18:52.766 --> 18:55.135
- What do you mean by tha...
- I mean you'd rather play

18:55.168 --> 18:58.405
assistant manager
and Princess Carosi,
than be anybody's friend.

18:58.438 --> 19:02.275
You're too busy looking down
your nose at us to see what
we're really like.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.310
You don't even
belong in this lounge,

19:04.344 --> 19:06.246
so why don't you
just stay out of it?

19:06.279 --> 19:08.348
It's for real employees.

19:12.519 --> 19:16.022
So the plan is to meet here
at 10:30 on
Friday night and...

19:16.056 --> 19:18.091
Uh, hold it a second, Lisa.

19:19.559 --> 19:23.430
There's a strong
undertow today.
You're out too far, come back!

19:25.532 --> 19:27.467
I hope he listens.
Sorry, Lisa.

19:27.500 --> 19:31.104
That's okay.
So we'll all pitch in and get
the room ready by midnight.

19:31.137 --> 19:33.606
- Slater will come
by with decorations...
- Uh-oh.

19:33.640 --> 19:35.709
He didn't listen.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.485
- What's going on here?
- Norman Shmeltzer's

19:45.518 --> 19:47.821
caught in the undertow.
Kelly's gone after him.

19:47.854 --> 19:49.556
Kelly?

19:51.691 --> 19:53.426
Here comes
another lawsuit.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.729
- Lisa: She's got him.
- She does?

19:55.762 --> 19:58.865
If I had to go out
and hire a female lifeguard,

19:58.898 --> 20:02.202
I said to myself,
"Leon, go out and
find the very best."

20:06.239 --> 20:08.541
( coughing )

20:12.178 --> 20:14.180
Are you all right, now?

20:14.214 --> 20:17.384
Yeah. Yeah,
just a little embarrassed.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.319
You were saved
by a girl, Norman.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.921
You're just gonna have to find
some way to live with it.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.493
Never let him swim out
that far again.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.262
Norman, thank goodness
you're all right!

20:29.295 --> 20:31.865
I felt like it was
my own son out there.

20:37.470 --> 20:40.540
Slater, where are these three
hot babes we're
supposed to meet?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.475
They're right here.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.746
Surprise!

20:47.914 --> 20:49.649
Happy birthday, Zack!

20:49.683 --> 20:52.452
You guys cheated.
My birthday's
not until tomorrow.

20:52.485 --> 20:55.355
No, it's 12:01 a.m.
Your birthday's right now.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.657
Hey, how come no one
let me in on the surprise?

20:57.691 --> 21:00.293
Because we wanted
to keep it a surprise.

21:00.326 --> 21:02.796
Some surprise,
Zack knew it was his birthday.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.300
( dance music playing )

21:11.971 --> 21:13.907
<i>* Happy birthday to you</i>

21:13.940 --> 21:16.276
<i>* Happy birthday,</i>
<i>dear Zack</i>

21:16.309 --> 21:18.378
<i>* Happy birthday to you *</i>

21:21.815 --> 21:24.284
Slater: Hey, what does
that cake say?

21:24.317 --> 21:27.554
Zack: "Happy Wrong Number
By the Sea."

21:27.587 --> 21:30.423
It's a long story.
Why don't you
blow out the candles?

21:30.457 --> 21:31.791
Okay.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.795
( cheering )

21:35.829 --> 21:37.697
Did you make a wish?

21:37.731 --> 21:39.833
You better all wish
for new jobs.

21:39.866 --> 21:43.770
- Mr. Carosi.
- Well,
birthday boy, I warned you.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.106
Now you're gonna take
your friends down with you.

21:46.106 --> 21:48.008
You're all fired.

21:48.108 --> 21:50.343
No, no, no! Please sir,
don't blame them.
It was my party.

21:50.377 --> 21:52.345
Don't blame him,
it was a surprise.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.414
Don't blame any of them.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.750
They had my permission
to throw a party.

21:56.783 --> 22:00.286
I thought it would
be a goodwill gesture
to the new employees.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.756
Why didn't you tell me that
when the beach patrol called

22:02.789 --> 22:04.157
and said there were
people at the club?

22:04.190 --> 22:06.860
Because you ran
off in such a frenzy,
I didn't get a chance to.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.662
- So I followed you here.
- Boy, is your face red.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.701
Stacy, in the future,
keep me better
informed of your whims.

22:14.734 --> 22:16.736
Now I'm going back to bed.

22:16.770 --> 22:19.572
( all sigh in relief )

22:22.609 --> 22:24.911
Uh... I don't know
what to say.

22:24.944 --> 22:27.814
You said enough
in the employees' lounge.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.849
That's why
I did what I did.

22:29.883 --> 22:33.586
Even spoiled brats
have their moments.

22:33.620 --> 22:36.790
But don't get the wrong idea,
because I want
this place spotless

22:36.823 --> 22:39.092
before the members
show up tomorrow.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.960
( everyone groans )

22:40.994 --> 22:43.630
Good night.

22:43.663 --> 22:47.400
Hey, Stacy? If you want
to buy me a present,

22:47.434 --> 22:50.370
I need a new surfboard, dude.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.114
( instrumental music plays )
