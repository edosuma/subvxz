WEBVTT

00:07.425 --> 00:12.471
<i>More, give me more Give me more</i>

00:13.014 --> 00:17.476
<i>If I had a heart
I could love you</i>

00:18.686 --> 00:22.398
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

00:24.859 --> 00:28.738
<i>After the night When I wake up</i>

00:29.572 --> 00:34.160
<i>I'll see What tomorrow brings</i>

00:41.292 --> 00:45.087
<i>If I had a voice I would sing</i>

01:13.449 --> 01:14.992
Steady.

01:32.468 --> 01:33.761
We followed your orders

01:33.844 --> 01:36.847
and appointed an earl in every
district under your control.

01:36.931 --> 01:38.974
They collect taxes and fines,

01:39.100 --> 01:43.229
and each one provides
60 soldiers for your army.

01:47.775 --> 01:48.776
Blacksmith!

01:49.694 --> 01:51.529
You understand
what you have to do?

01:52.113 --> 01:54.782
I do. In deed.
I'm straight to work.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.952
Ood man.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.168
So?

02:06.252 --> 02:08.129
We saw two armies
marching together.

02:08.212 --> 02:09.672
One was led by Bjorn Ironside

02:09.755 --> 02:11.507
and King Harald Finehair.

02:13.843 --> 02:15.010
You recognized them?

02:15.261 --> 02:16.345
And the other army?

02:16.429 --> 02:18.180
By a king or earl
we did not recognize.

02:18.264 --> 02:20.558
Together with someone
we did recognize.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.477
My brother. Hvitserk?
Yes. My King.

02:27.648 --> 02:28.899
And you're completely sure?

02:29.275 --> 02:31.527
Yes. Without any doubt.

02:40.035 --> 02:41.579
Well, that is good, huh?

02:42.538 --> 02:44.039
Don't you think
that's good, Freydis?

02:45.708 --> 02:48.586
My fellow gods, at last,
allowed me to see my fate.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.464
Now, all of my brothers
are against me.

02:56.093 --> 02:57.720
Now I know I'm the chosen one.

03:20.159 --> 03:23.746
Ivar has clearly
made preparations for a siege.

03:23.829 --> 03:26.207
And perhaps we should
negotiate with him.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.291
No.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.417
No.

03:29.502 --> 03:30.544
My brother is right.

03:33.130 --> 03:35.257
Never again will we
negotiate with Ivar.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.469
It is useless.

04:05.663 --> 04:07.039
What happened to you, Lagertha?

04:11.502 --> 04:12.837
I almost died.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.173
But was reborn.

04:19.260 --> 04:21.887
You were between life and death.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.181
What did that teach you?

04:27.476 --> 04:29.311
The only thing that I've learned

04:30.813 --> 04:34.149
is that life is about suffering.

04:36.151 --> 04:37.987
There's no escape from it.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.948
That's the truth.

04:44.118 --> 04:45.661
What's important

04:46.370 --> 04:50.416
is how we deal with suffering,
how we deal with the truth.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.133
How do I tell my children

04:59.216 --> 05:00.759
that life is
all about suffering?

05:02.678 --> 05:04.722
They will find out
for themselves.

05:15.316 --> 05:16.859
Soon, we shall reach Kattegat.

05:18.903 --> 05:21.989
And once more, brother will
fight against brother.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.534
And the world will be wrecked.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.997
Midgard will be wrenched by wars

05:30.831 --> 05:31.832
for three winters.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.501
Fathers will slaughter sons.

05:34.877 --> 05:38.714
Brothers will be drenched
in one another's blood.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.342
Mothers will desert
their men folk

05:41.842 --> 05:44.261
and seduce their own sons.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.473
Fimbulvetr,

05:48.974 --> 05:53.687
the winter of winters will grip

05:54.188 --> 05:56.815
and throttle Midgard.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.069
Fenrir, the wolf,

06:01.487 --> 06:05.616
will seize the sun
between his jaws

06:06.033 --> 06:07.910
and swallow her.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.455
He will spatter
Asgard with gore.

06:12.498 --> 06:17.294
And then the warriors and all the
gods in Valhalla will bear arms

06:17.378 --> 06:20.589
and fight against the giants
and the serpents

06:22.466 --> 06:24.343
unleashed against Midgard.

06:25.886 --> 06:26.971
Odin

06:27.763 --> 06:31.684
and the wolf will be
the first to engage.

06:32.643 --> 06:36.730
And the battle will be fearsome.

06:37.523 --> 06:43.278
Though in the end, the wolf
will swallow Allfather.

06:44.363 --> 06:47.032
That will be the death of Odin.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.619
And then worlds will burn,

06:51.495 --> 06:53.163
and the gods will die.

06:54.373 --> 06:55.958
And the sun will be dark,

06:56.083 --> 06:58.252
and there'll be
no stars in the sky.

06:58.794 --> 07:01.463
And the Earth
will sink into the sea.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.386
Ragnarok.

07:14.018 --> 07:15.644
It's only a story.

07:17.396 --> 07:19.898
Stories are all we have.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.443
- Attack the gates.
- I agree.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.528
We will divide our forces

08:06.612 --> 08:08.530
and attack two of
the gates simultaneously

08:08.614 --> 08:10.240
with the greatest violence.

08:10.783 --> 08:11.784
If we divide our forces,

08:13.035 --> 08:14.828
we need to be able
to know one another.

08:20.834 --> 08:21.960
For my brother.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.464
For Halfdan.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.355
<i>War, What â€œvs W?</i>

08:47.611 --> 08:49.530
I need to know
that you've forgiven me.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.412
I'm sorry

08:59.498 --> 09:00.791
for all that I do.

09:04.461 --> 09:05.546
I'm sorry.

09:08.132 --> 09:09.466
I love you, Freydis.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.261
You know that.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.683
And I love you, too.

09:21.270 --> 09:22.521
And I forgive you.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.529
Man the wall!

09:56.054 --> 09:57.306
I have to go.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.602
Take care of yourself.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.645
And you.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.107
Beloved.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.569
- This way.
- Hurry up!

11:06.208 --> 11:07.876
Man the wall!

11:12.005 --> 11:13.465
Come on!

11:14.591 --> 11:15.676
Be ready.

11:16.969 --> 11:18.804
Archers ready!

11:21.390 --> 11:22.891
Defend the towers!

12:06.852 --> 12:08.270
Forward.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.944
Archers,

12:17.654 --> 12:18.655
loose!

12:26.955 --> 12:27.956
Move!

12:29.124 --> 12:31.293
Archers, loose!

12:34.713 --> 12:35.714
Loose!

12:42.095 --> 12:43.722
Move!
Shield-wall!

12:45.682 --> 12:46.975
Ram!

12:48.810 --> 12:49.936
Back.

12:50.771 --> 12:51.813
Shoot back.

12:52.189 --> 12:53.482
Ram!

12:56.735 --> 12:59.362
Welcome home, Bjorn.
Ram!

12:59.946 --> 13:01.948
Welcome home. Loose!

13:04.618 --> 13:05.952
Open.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.892
Charge!

13:32.020 --> 13:33.063
Move!

14:00.006 --> 14:01.007
Open.

14:07.264 --> 14:08.640
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

14:08.723 --> 14:10.058
Why hast Thou forsaken me?

14:10.142 --> 14:12.060
Why art Thou so far
from helping me?

14:12.144 --> 14:14.729
Thou hast led me
into the dust of death.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.276
Forward. Move.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.200
Forward.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.372
Loose.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.917
To the wall. To the wall.
Go, to the wall.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.752
Loose.

14:37.919 --> 14:39.171
Shoot them.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.331
You can't help me
or hear me, can you?

15:14.414 --> 15:15.957
Because you're not there.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.294
No, you don't exist.

15:20.420 --> 15:21.588
Loose.

15:28.803 --> 15:30.680
Go, climb the ladders.

15:31.097 --> 15:33.058
Climb to the top! Go, go.

15:36.478 --> 15:37.854
Come on! Come on!

15:38.355 --> 15:39.731
Come on!

15:42.859 --> 15:45.320
- My brother. You've come too late.
- Go.

15:45.862 --> 15:47.280
Much too late.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.658
Just get us in.
Just do it.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.166
Push!

15:58.875 --> 16:00.168
Go to the other gate.

16:02.379 --> 16:04.798
Now! Burn them alive.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.812
Push! Ram!

16:21.773 --> 16:24.276
Come and see.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.946
Come and see
the death of humanity

16:28.363 --> 16:31.199
upon a shore of corpses.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.201
Broken heads.

16:33.535 --> 16:35.203
Spilled guts.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.831
Scorched flesh.

16:38.456 --> 16:43.378
Come and see the young tearing
each other's throats out.

16:43.837 --> 16:48.800
Rivers of poison will flow
through the halls.

16:49.968 --> 16:53.179
Oath breakers, philanderers,

16:54.014 --> 16:58.310
murderers will wade
through those rivers.

16:58.810 --> 17:01.271
Come and see. Come and see.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.088
We're beaten.
We have to retreat.

18:08.546 --> 18:12.550
No, what if Bjorn is winning?

18:12.634 --> 18:14.427
What if he's already
inside the gate?

18:14.803 --> 18:16.304
We cannot run away now.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.808
Archers, draw.

18:26.940 --> 18:29.401
Back! Ram!

18:31.402 --> 18:33.154
Back! Ram!

18:35.031 --> 18:36.074
Again.

18:36.491 --> 18:37.700
Again.
Bring it in.

18:40.286 --> 18:41.287
Ready?

18:42.080 --> 18:44.582
Hit. Pull.

18:45.458 --> 18:46.459
Hit.

18:54.884 --> 18:55.885
Again.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.056
Again.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.147
Hit.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.107
Hit.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.443
Back. Hit.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.989
Back. Ram.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.210
Down.

19:41.764 --> 19:42.765
Shield-wall.

19:46.269 --> 19:47.562
Archers.

19:47.729 --> 19:48.730
Draw!

19:49.772 --> 19:50.982
Loose.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.194
Close in.

19:56.821 --> 19:57.822
- Loose.
- Loose.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.582
- Loose.
- Loose.

20:08.625 --> 20:10.126
- Draw!
- Loose!

20:10.627 --> 20:13.004
Draw. Loose. Draw.

20:19.135 --> 20:20.595
Draw!

20:20.845 --> 20:21.846
Break.

20:22.931 --> 20:23.932
Push through.

20:29.812 --> 20:30.897
Shield-wall.
Shield-wall!

20:38.571 --> 20:39.572
Bjorn.

20:40.281 --> 20:41.491
Go! Go!

20:50.124 --> 20:52.418
Call the retreat.
Call the retreat.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.588
Go, call the retreat.

20:56.506 --> 20:57.548
Sound the retreat.

20:58.341 --> 21:00.510
Retreat. Retreat.

21:00.593 --> 21:01.886
Retreat.
Retreat.

21:01.970 --> 21:03.471
Retreat.
Retreat.

21:03.888 --> 21:05.473
Yeah!

21:08.559 --> 21:09.727
Retreat.

21:25.451 --> 21:26.619
Odin is with me.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.581
I'm Ragnar's son.

21:31.833 --> 21:34.002
Odin is with me
and you cannot kill me.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.423
I'm Ragnar's son.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.602
Get down, you fool.

21:54.063 --> 21:57.900
Retreat.
I wonder about you, Magnus.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.569
I always have.

22:00.194 --> 22:02.572
At first, I thought
you were a Saxon spy.

22:02.697 --> 22:05.533
I was never anyone's spy.
I never was.

22:06.242 --> 22:07.368
I was just unlucky.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.704
I didn't know who I was
until right now.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.437
You know who I am.

22:35.104 --> 22:38.191
I'm Bjorn
Ironside, son of Ragnar.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.610
I grew up with many of you.

22:41.736 --> 22:44.280
You were my neighbors.
My friends.

22:45.365 --> 22:47.408
We played together
when we were children.

22:48.659 --> 22:50.328
I'm not your enemy.

22:51.371 --> 22:52.914
Ivar is your enemy.

22:54.499 --> 22:57.335
He rules over you
with tyranny and cruelty.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.712
He wants to destroy
everything my father did.

22:59.796 --> 23:02.173
He's lying. Kill him,
he's lying.

23:19.899 --> 23:20.900
You know me.

23:43.673 --> 23:46.050
What are we to do now, huh?

23:47.468 --> 23:52.390
There's no point to us
attacking the gates again.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.142
We will never get in that way.

23:58.604 --> 24:01.274
We have lost
a great many brave warriors.

24:02.316 --> 24:03.734
The crows are probably feasting

24:03.818 --> 24:05.778
with their hearts
and livers right now.

24:07.822 --> 24:10.658
If it was me, I would walk
away from this battle.

24:12.201 --> 24:13.703
I do not see a way to win.

24:14.954 --> 24:15.955
Ivar is clever.

24:16.914 --> 24:20.626
Everything you all think,
he has already thought.

24:22.420 --> 24:26.340
Bjorn and I are sons of Ragnar Lothbrok.
We don't give in.

24:28.759 --> 24:29.886
That's fine.

24:30.428 --> 24:33.764
But Ivar is a son
of Ragnar as well.

24:34.432 --> 24:35.558
So what?

24:38.853 --> 24:39.854
"So what?"

24:44.692 --> 24:47.820
When I tell you to kill
Bjorn, you kill him.

24:50.364 --> 24:52.116
You have to
understand one thing,

24:52.200 --> 24:54.327
that Bjorn is not your friend.

24:54.744 --> 24:55.995
He is your enemy.

24:57.246 --> 25:00.625
If he and King Harald succeed
in their ambitions,

25:00.708 --> 25:02.126
then what future do we have?

25:04.879 --> 25:06.839
They have great plans. Yes.

25:07.548 --> 25:09.717
But those plans
do not involve you.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.137
You, the ordinary folk
of Kattegat,

25:13.221 --> 25:16.140
I'm the only one
who speaks for you.

25:17.683 --> 25:21.479
And I swear that I will live
and die for any of you.

25:23.981 --> 25:24.982
All that I ask

25:26.859 --> 25:30.112
is for your absolute loyalty.

25:31.781 --> 25:33.074
Otherwise,

25:35.201 --> 25:37.078
we shall all perish together.

25:52.343 --> 25:53.803
What are you thinking?

25:55.888 --> 25:57.223
About everything.

26:00.268 --> 26:01.561
About Kattegat.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.439
About Ragnar.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.903
About how I've been
a poor father.

26:13.614 --> 26:14.907
I have thoughts, too.

26:16.534 --> 26:17.702
I had dreams.

26:19.579 --> 26:20.871
I lost a husband.

26:22.123 --> 26:23.583
And I have never had children.

26:26.877 --> 26:28.170
Do you want children?

26:29.839 --> 26:31.382
It's what my body was made for.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.597
Except to give
pleasure to me and to men.

26:42.935 --> 26:44.812
You're an extraordinary
woman, Gunnhild.

26:47.023 --> 26:48.482
I'm just like any other woman.

26:50.151 --> 26:51.861
Don't want to have
to do anything.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.323
Don't want to be trapped.

27:00.828 --> 27:02.079
I want to fight.

27:04.373 --> 27:05.750
And I want to ride wild horses.

27:08.085 --> 27:10.421
And I want to be
unknowable to you,

27:10.504 --> 27:12.506
even though I want us
to be in love.

27:13.966 --> 27:14.967
I'm crazy, right?

27:17.637 --> 27:19.180
I had an idea you might be.

27:20.181 --> 27:21.390
It didn't put you off?

27:25.728 --> 27:26.812
Listen.

27:27.229 --> 27:28.439
I want to have sex.

27:32.151 --> 27:33.361
I might die tomorrow.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.321
Or you might die tomorrow.

27:36.781 --> 27:38.908
But in any case, if possible,

27:38.991 --> 27:41.661
I should like to be with child.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.792
To have life
stirring inside of me.

27:51.671 --> 27:52.672
Yes!

28:40.469 --> 28:42.263
Halt! Who are you?

28:54.734 --> 28:56.777
Freydis. what are you doing here?
I had to come.

28:58.529 --> 28:59.572
I have things to say.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.119
Thora is dead.

29:07.037 --> 29:08.497
Ivar burned her alive.

29:09.665 --> 29:11.083
Along with many others.

29:13.002 --> 29:14.587
I am so very sorry.

29:16.964 --> 29:18.132
He killed our baby.

29:19.341 --> 29:21.469
He's a monster,
you have to stop him.

29:22.470 --> 29:23.471
How?

29:24.680 --> 29:26.766
There is a secret way
into the town.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.019
Ivar created it for
his own escape.

29:30.519 --> 29:31.812
It's how I got out.

29:33.606 --> 29:34.875
I will show
your scouts where it is,

29:34.899 --> 29:36.650
and I will open it for you
in the morning.

29:38.194 --> 29:39.195
Be ready.

29:43.657 --> 29:44.700
Thank you.

29:45.493 --> 29:47.912
I want to see Ivar
strung up in a tree.

29:56.337 --> 29:57.421
Do you trust her?

30:02.051 --> 30:03.219
What choice do we have?

31:03.070 --> 31:04.655
They are attacking
the walls again.

31:08.242 --> 31:10.369
I'm not sure
I even need to get out of bed.

31:45.738 --> 31:48.073
EnoughlEnough!

31:50.034 --> 31:51.368
People of Kattegat.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.412
<i>We've come for War.</i>

31:54.580 --> 31:56.874
We have no intention
of killing our friends.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.502
Stay inside. Don't fight us.

32:01.253 --> 32:02.796
We are here to set you free.

32:38.540 --> 32:40.459
<i>N an!</i>

33:05.609 --> 33:09.571
Freydis, my love.
Where are you?

33:11.031 --> 33:12.032
I'm here.

33:13.242 --> 33:14.243
Come here.

33:15.119 --> 33:16.120
I need you.

33:20.666 --> 33:21.667
Someone let them in.

33:23.627 --> 33:24.878
What do you mean?

33:25.087 --> 33:27.673
There's no other way they could
have gotten inside the walls.

33:27.756 --> 33:30.342
Someone betrayed me
and let them in.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.560
Are you going to deny it?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.020
No.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.524
On the body of our dead son, no.

33:49.862 --> 33:51.238
I let them in.

34:16.180 --> 34:17.181
I love you.

34:25.564 --> 34:27.149
You're the most beautiful thing

34:27.232 --> 34:29.067
that ever happened to me.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.029
And there's a part of me

34:32.863 --> 34:34.281
that will always love you.

34:48.629 --> 34:51.423
Later, when I have time,

34:53.383 --> 34:54.802
I will sit and weep for you.

34:57.846 --> 34:59.014
I love you, Freydis.

35:08.732 --> 35:09.942
I love you, Freydis.

35:12.486 --> 35:13.570
I love you.

36:13.046 --> 36:14.047
Ivar!

36:15.132 --> 36:16.925
<i>N an!</i>

37:24.952 --> 37:26.119
Thank you.

37:41.009 --> 37:42.010
<i>Nat.</i>

37:44.054 --> 37:45.681
<i>Nat, where are you?</i>

37:47.474 --> 37:48.684
Surrender.

39:28.075 --> 39:29.409
Here's to the new year

39:30.160 --> 39:34.873
of all our lives,
Bjorn Ironside.

40:17.249 --> 40:18.333
You're alive.

40:23.797 --> 40:25.507
And here's the sword of kings.

40:26.800 --> 40:30.220
Hail King Bjorn,
King of Kattegat.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.308
Hail, King Bjorn!

40:36.101 --> 40:38.186
Hail, King Bjorn!

41:24.024 --> 41:25.358
<i>Why do you want to fight?</i>

41:29.988 --> 41:31.531
<i>And what are you fighting for?</i>

41:45.212 --> 41:46.296
<i>What do you seek?</i>

41:48.715 --> 41:49.716
Power.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.969
<i>Power is always dangerous.</i>

41:53.678 --> 41:57.349
<i>It attracts the worst
and corrupts the best.</i>

41:59.017 --> 42:00.560
<i>Power is only given to those</i>

42:00.852 --> 42:04.689
who are prepared to lower
themselves to pick it up.

42:12.072 --> 42:14.157
And so, it has come to pass,

42:15.533 --> 42:17.244
the future foretold.

42:18.203 --> 42:21.248
The dark raven, the eagle

42:21.373 --> 42:25.460
and the wolf have laid bare
the bones of corpses.

42:26.461 --> 42:29.214
Here is the story of the world.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.634
Make what use of it you can.

42:36.096 --> 42:37.639
What of my rule?

42:40.016 --> 42:41.559
What is to become of me?

42:42.978 --> 42:47.107
No one will ever forget
the name of Bjorn Ironside.

42:47.816 --> 42:49.859
Greater than Ragnar.

42:52.195 --> 42:53.989
But the war is not over.

42:57.367 --> 42:58.827
Is any of this real?
