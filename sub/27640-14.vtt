WEBVTT

00:01.627 --> 00:03.503
(Birds chirp)

00:05.756 --> 00:07.424
(Low happy whistling)

00:07.424 --> 00:10.469
- Oh my gosh,
is this what marriage is?

00:10.469 --> 00:12.429
- Nope, this is just left over
from the picnic yesterday,

00:12.429 --> 00:14.306
and I didn't wanna waste it so.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.308
(Glasses clink)
- Hmm, you could've lied.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.559
- And what are we doing
over here?

00:17.559 --> 00:19.269
- Hmm.

00:19.269 --> 00:20.771
I'm just editing some
of our engagement photos.

00:20.771 --> 00:22.397
- Oh!
- You look great.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.983
I look like I crawled out
from under a bridge.

00:24.983 --> 00:26.818
- Hey, have you given any
more thought to uh,

00:26.818 --> 00:27.945
when you wanna start
telling people?

00:27.945 --> 00:29.488
I'm kinda scared
to do it today,

00:29.488 --> 00:30.906
I don't think your mom would
want anything upstaging

00:30.906 --> 00:32.574
opening night of the show.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.993
- Yeah, and I think we need
that added hiccup, so...

00:34.993 --> 00:36.578
- So, tomorrow then?
- Yeah.

00:36.578 --> 00:37.996
I mean, I haven't really
given it that much thought.

00:37.996 --> 00:39.915
- Yeah.
- So...

00:39.915 --> 00:41.833
one other option.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.336
What if,
after the show tonight,

00:44.336 --> 00:46.838
we corralled a few people
back to the motel?

00:46.838 --> 00:49.299
You know, we talk about the
show for five to ten minutes,

00:49.299 --> 00:50.717
then maybe dim the lights,
pop some bubbly,

00:50.717 --> 00:52.261
put some music on.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.388
I could stand up
and give a speech.

00:54.388 --> 00:56.515
I'd look to you, you don't need
to give a speech,

00:56.515 --> 00:58.350
but at this point I think
Alexis will be getting misty,

00:58.350 --> 00:59.851
which will send sort
of this intoxicating

00:59.851 --> 01:01.895
ripple effect through the room.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.981
Most people will be sobbing.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.524
And I'll be holding back tears,

01:05.524 --> 01:07.192
but the fact that I'm holding
them back, I think,

01:07.192 --> 01:08.902
will make it all the more
powerful.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.862
And you can be topping up
drinks.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.699
- Great to know you've barely
given this any thought.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.826
I am gonna start the day.

01:15.826 --> 01:17.160
Big show tonight.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.706
- Good luck, honey!
- It's "break a leg".

01:20.706 --> 01:25.794
♪♪♪

01:26.795 --> 01:29.381
(Alexis hums under her breath)

01:32.342 --> 01:33.677
- Aah!

01:33.677 --> 01:36.888
- Oh, just checking in
on my little girl,

01:36.888 --> 01:39.308
and see how she's feeling
about everything.

01:39.308 --> 01:41.268
- Okay, she'd be feeling
a lot better

01:41.268 --> 01:43.145
if you weren't checking in
every five minutes.

01:44.479 --> 01:47.649
- Anyway, I just stopped by
to uh...

01:47.649 --> 01:49.192
give you this.

01:49.192 --> 01:52.154
- Thank you. That's very sweet.

01:55.532 --> 01:57.492
- Well, you don't have
to open it now.

01:59.494 --> 02:02.664
No need to open it now,
you can open it later.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.791
Even though the intention
was to...

02:04.791 --> 02:06.877
maybe open it before the show.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.962
- Okay, fine,
I will open it now.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.590
But ever since I told you
I was leaving,

02:11.590 --> 02:13.258
you've been giving me
little things

02:13.258 --> 02:14.968
that just make me feel bad
about it.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.762
- Oh, that's not true, honey.
That's-that not true at all.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.513
(Paper rustles)

02:18.513 --> 02:20.432
- Like this.

02:20.432 --> 02:21.933
- Well, that's a little
something

02:21.933 --> 02:23.977
you can use backstage tonight,

02:23.977 --> 02:27.314
or maybe put it on your bedside
table when you're away.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.815
- You expect me to bring
this with me?!

02:28.815 --> 02:30.901
This frame is like, ten pounds!

02:30.901 --> 02:33.653
- "Break all your legs."

02:33.653 --> 02:35.781
A well-intentioned,
if not slightly misguided

02:35.781 --> 02:38.992
sentiment from the Elmdale
Arts Council.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.412
Alexis, when do you
and Theodore depart

02:42.412 --> 02:44.414
for your equatorial adventure?

02:44.414 --> 02:47.542
- Ted leaves tonight.
I leave in a week.

02:47.542 --> 02:48.960
- Well, that seems like
poor planning.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.421
Why aren't you flying
with him tonight?

02:51.421 --> 02:54.925
- Because I'm in the show.
- Well, Of course you are!

02:54.925 --> 02:56.802
Oh! Well, I have to tell you,

02:56.802 --> 02:59.346
I am impressed!

02:59.346 --> 03:01.807
Alexis, my phone's been ringing
nonstop since 7 a.m.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.308
you certainly engaged
the press.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.810
- Thank you.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.645
- If I'm receiving
this kind of buzz

03:06.645 --> 03:09.606
from a boutique theatrical run,
imagine the fanfare

03:09.606 --> 03:11.900
you will drum up when
the "Crows" movie

03:11.900 --> 03:13.902
gets its premiere date.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.988
- What do you mean,
"that I will drum up?"

03:16.988 --> 03:18.949
- Well, after careful
concertation,

03:18.949 --> 03:21.201
and two attempts to get
Lizzie Grubman

03:21.201 --> 03:22.994
to do some pro bono work,

03:22.994 --> 03:25.497
I have decided...

03:25.497 --> 03:28.625
Alexis, I would love you
to do all my publicity!

03:28.625 --> 03:31.211
- Oh my God! What?!

03:31.211 --> 03:32.963
When is this supposed to happen?

03:32.963 --> 03:35.382
- Last I heard, the fall.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.801
- I will be in the Galapagos.

03:37.801 --> 03:39.845
- Well, again, poor planning.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.472
- Well, you just told me
right now!

03:42.472 --> 03:45.183
- Oh, this sounds like
an opportunity, Alexis.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.644
I mean, are you sure
being away this long

03:47.644 --> 03:49.604
is such a good idea?
- Yes!

03:49.604 --> 03:52.315
I'm going to support
my boyfriend,

03:52.315 --> 03:54.734
and hopefully, eat, pray, love,
a bit for myself.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.447
- Yes. Family! Family.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.283
We need to stop and embrace
this precious moment.

04:01.283 --> 04:03.410
And I'm not just saying that
because David's at Patrick's,

04:03.410 --> 04:06.204
and the energy is unusually
light around here.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.959
We are all on the precipice
of greatness.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.336
And we should cherish
these moments,

04:13.336 --> 04:15.380
before everything changes.

04:18.425 --> 04:20.218
(Cell phone rings)

04:23.388 --> 04:24.890
Hmm. And I'm still cherishing.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.475
Just...

04:26.475 --> 04:28.268
oh, I do have to take this.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.270
It could be the Elm Grove
Sentinel calling about my...

04:30.270 --> 04:32.564
cover story.

04:32.564 --> 04:36.193
Moira Rose Enterprises,
how may I direct your call?

04:36.193 --> 04:38.528
Well, yes, my assistant
is very busy.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.489
- Dad! (Groans)

04:41.990 --> 04:44.493
(Door opens)

04:44.493 --> 04:45.327
- (Laughs)

04:47.537 --> 04:48.663
- Uh oh.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.833
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.838
- Who are those for?
- They're for you.

04:56.838 --> 04:59.841
I wanted to wish you luck
for your big show.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.469
You've been stepping very far
outside of your comfort zone,

05:02.469 --> 05:04.846
and I think that takes
a lot of courage.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.431
- I don't think
I've ever heard you use

05:06.431 --> 05:08.767
the word "courage" before.
- Hmm.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.311
- Outside of criticizing
someone's style choices.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.649
What's going on?
- Nothing.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.442
- You're only this happy
when you have gossip,

05:17.442 --> 05:19.945
or there's something
in the news about Oprah.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.280
- There's something
in the news about Oprah.

05:22.280 --> 05:25.325
She got new espadrilles.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.910
- Oh my God, David.

05:26.910 --> 05:28.870
- You have a show to focus on,
we'll celebrate tonight.

05:28.870 --> 05:30.914
- Celebrate what?

05:30.914 --> 05:32.666
- You! The show.

05:33.959 --> 05:37.546
- So, I guess I'll just
see you tonight, then.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.881
Bye.
- Fine.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.343
Patrick proposed,
and I said yes.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.430
- Oh my God!
Oh my God, David!

05:47.430 --> 05:49.474
- I know.
- Oh my God!

05:49.474 --> 05:51.476
(Laughs)

05:51.476 --> 05:53.770
I'm so happy for you!

05:53.770 --> 05:55.689
Oh! Oh my God!

05:56.940 --> 05:59.526
When did this happen?

05:59.526 --> 06:00.652
- Last night.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.612
- Oh my God!

06:02.612 --> 06:04.656
(Sobs) Ohhh!

06:06.533 --> 06:08.326
- Are you okay?

06:08.326 --> 06:09.619
- Oh! Yes.

06:10.662 --> 06:13.206
I'm happy!

06:13.206 --> 06:15.375
You just caught me off guard.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.335
- See, this is why
I wanted to wait.

06:17.335 --> 06:19.713
- No, I'm glad you told me!

06:19.713 --> 06:22.674
It's just nerves.
About the show.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.217
- Okay.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.885
- Which I should get back
to doing.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.180
Because there's this scene
that I just can't get.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.643
- Well, you are the only
person I've told,

06:33.643 --> 06:35.812
so if we could just keep
this between us

06:35.812 --> 06:38.315
until after the show,
that would be great.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.817
- Got it.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.655
Congratulations, David.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.657
- Thank you.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.826
(Door opens, then slams)

06:51.494 --> 06:52.871
- (Sobbing)

06:52.871 --> 06:55.373
Roland: Yeah, uh, dark hair.

06:55.373 --> 06:57.459
Answers to the name "Stevie".

06:57.459 --> 06:59.794
Um, kind of looks
like a vampire.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.339
A little skittish
when approached.

07:02.339 --> 07:04.466
Um, you know, I don't want
to tell you how to do your job,

07:04.466 --> 07:07.218
but if you have a taser,
you may want to use it.

07:08.345 --> 07:10.472
Okay, yeah, thanks, bye.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.474
- I should've known the risk.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.476
The toll that stage fright
can take on someone

07:14.476 --> 07:17.437
who's not used to the hot sting
of the spotlight.

07:17.437 --> 07:21.316
I was a fool not to let
Gwen understudy.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.609
- What is going on in here?

07:22.609 --> 07:24.444
- Stevie's gone missing,

07:24.444 --> 07:25.862
and I don't wanna be
an optimist here,

07:25.862 --> 07:27.739
but it's not looking good.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.200
- What? What do you mean,
Stevie's gone missing?

07:30.200 --> 07:31.868
- I can't find her anywhere!

07:31.868 --> 07:33.453
I've called her all day,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.622
and Bob saw her crying
at the gas station.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.290
The last thing she said
to your father was,

07:37.290 --> 07:38.792
- What?!
- she had to do something.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.337
- Well, I saw her this morning.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.923
- Huh, well you may have
been the last person

07:44.923 --> 07:46.633
to see her, Dave.

07:46.633 --> 07:48.301
I don't know how you're gonna
feel about this,

07:48.301 --> 07:49.928
but I'm gonna need some
hair samples.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.930
- What happened, David?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.890
Did you say anything that might
have triggered her?

07:53.890 --> 07:55.809
You have that effect on people.

07:55.809 --> 07:59.521
- Uh, she said she was
nervous about the show.

07:59.521 --> 08:02.273
- With but a handful
of hours before curtain?

08:02.273 --> 08:05.151
Any morsel of intel is crucial!

08:06.820 --> 08:09.823
- Fine! Patrick proposed to me
yesterday,

08:09.823 --> 08:11.950
and I may have told her
about it.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.828
- Oh, David!
- Wow, a wedding.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.872
Congratulations, Dave.
- I don't know what to say.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.667
- I know, it was very
overwhelming for me, as well.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.503
- Why could you not have waited
until after the show

08:23.503 --> 08:25.547
to tell people you're engaged?!

08:25.547 --> 08:27.340
- You're engaged?!

08:27.340 --> 08:29.676
- This is not how the
announcement was supposed go!

08:29.676 --> 08:31.511
- Okay, but I'm gonna be away!

08:31.511 --> 08:33.304
Who's gonna plan the wedding?
- Well, I could ask Jocelyn.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.306
She planned her
brother-in-law's funeral

08:35.306 --> 08:37.350
for under a hundred bucks.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.644
- Okay, this is like, the last
thing I needed to hear today!

08:39.644 --> 08:41.646
- When did this become
about you?

08:41.646 --> 08:44.607
- Exactly!
if we don't find Stevie,

08:44.607 --> 08:47.652
a lot of people are going
to be very disappointed!

08:47.652 --> 08:49.821
- I just announced
I'm getting married!

08:49.821 --> 08:51.740
- David, you and your wonderful
Patrick

08:51.740 --> 08:53.825
have years to celebrate!

08:54.826 --> 08:59.914
What a unanimously disastrous
day this is turning out to be!

08:59.914 --> 09:01.583
- Ugh!

09:01.583 --> 09:03.168
- What the fuck?!

09:03.835 --> 09:05.503
- (Noisy sobs)

09:05.503 --> 09:07.338
(High-pitched squeaky whimper)

09:10.467 --> 09:13.136
(Music plays softly,
audience murmurs)

09:13.136 --> 09:14.721
- Okay, so I told Stevie
and next thing you know,

09:14.721 --> 09:16.723
she is nowhere to be found.

09:16.723 --> 09:17.766
I just wish this whole
engagement announcement

09:17.766 --> 09:19.517
hadn't gotten so out of control.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.769
I mean, people are coming
up to me

09:20.769 --> 09:22.729
that I haven't even
spoken to yet.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.106
- Gentlemen, major show
drama aside,

09:25.106 --> 09:26.983
I just wanted to say
congratulations

09:26.983 --> 09:28.777
to the future Mister
and Mister.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.070
Or is it "Misters?"
- See?

09:31.070 --> 09:33.198
Now Jocelyn,
how did you find out?

09:33.198 --> 09:34.532
- Oh, from Moira.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.743
Maybe Alexis.
Possibly Gwen.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.453
- Thanks Jocelyn,
but I'm actually

09:38.453 --> 09:40.497
a little more concerned
about the show at the moment.

09:40.497 --> 09:43.333
- Don't worry,
Moira says she has a plan.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.876
- Oh, does she?

09:44.876 --> 09:47.212
- Oh God, David! No, no, no,
no, David, I'm sorry.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.714
No, just performers backstage
from here on.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.342
- Mrs. Rose, are you-are you
a performer at this point?

09:52.342 --> 09:54.552
- Unfortunately,
I have no choice.

09:54.552 --> 09:55.804
So I'm gonna shimmy off
the rust,

09:55.804 --> 09:57.680
and pray there's still
dazzle within.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.974
- Sorry, sorry. (Gasps) Oh.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.018
- Stevie, what the fuck?!
- Mrs. Rose?

10:02.018 --> 10:04.729
- Stevie, thank God
you're here!

10:04.729 --> 10:07.065
Okay everybody, vocal warm up
in the Green Room!

10:09.234 --> 10:10.735
- Bye.
- Bye. Good luck.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.113
- Mrs. Rose, I'm sorry.
I had an errand to run,

10:13.113 --> 10:15.031
and I got stuck in traffic
on the way back.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.991
- Yeah, I've been calling you
all day.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.743
- I know, you told me
to block everyone out today,

10:18.743 --> 10:20.453
so I left my phone at home,

10:20.453 --> 10:23.373
which I realize
was a really big mistake.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.958
- (Sighs)

10:27.085 --> 10:30.755
Oh, were you planning
on taking my place?

10:30.755 --> 10:34.008
- Oh! Just dressed in theme
to support, that's all.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.387
I think I'll um...

10:37.387 --> 10:39.681
I'm going to go see
if Jocelyn uh...

10:39.681 --> 10:42.058
got the humidifier, excuse me.

10:42.058 --> 10:44.435
I just have to check on her.
I just... Jocelyn?

10:44.435 --> 10:46.062
- Okay, I'm sorry!

10:46.062 --> 10:48.273
I should never have told you
before the show.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.607
- Here.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.610
- What is this?

10:52.610 --> 10:54.237
- Patrick asked for my blessing
a few weeks ago,

10:54.237 --> 10:55.697
so I had them made.

10:55.697 --> 10:57.574
It would've been nice
if he told me

10:57.574 --> 10:59.742
when it was happening,

10:59.742 --> 11:01.411
I literally could've picked
these up

11:01.411 --> 11:04.455
any other day this week,
but I will yell at him later.

11:07.125 --> 11:09.460
I assume you two will be moving
in together,

11:09.460 --> 11:12.213
and I won't be there to give
you towels when you need them,

11:12.213 --> 11:14.299
so...
- Thank you.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.467
I appreciate the monogramming,

11:16.467 --> 11:18.303
and the choice of thread colour.

11:19.762 --> 11:22.140
(Exhales) I thought you
were upset.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.767
- I was more upset that I had
to drive to Elmdale today.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.603
- (Laughs)

11:26.603 --> 11:28.730
I also appreciate this
burlesque-y get up.

11:28.730 --> 11:32.233
- Excuse me. You're an almost
married man, now.

11:32.233 --> 11:35.612
- Stevie. I'd ask if you could
hold us up more,

11:35.612 --> 11:37.614
but I'm not a big fan
of rhetorical questions.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.490
- Gotta go.
- Good luck!

11:41.284 --> 11:43.036
Cast: Ahhhhh!

11:43.036 --> 11:45.204
(Instruments tune up)

11:48.041 --> 11:50.126
- Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.420
- Hey David,
congrats on the news!

11:52.420 --> 11:54.130
Really happy for you guys.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.757
- Okay, you know what,
the funny thing was,

11:55.757 --> 11:57.675
originally I was going to be
the one that told people.

11:57.675 --> 11:59.344
- Told people what?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.346
- Oh, does your Dad not know?

12:01.346 --> 12:04.140
- If we're talking about
Dave's big engagement news,

12:04.140 --> 12:06.517
uh, we haven't decided
on a best man yet,

12:06.517 --> 12:08.353
but we think it's probably
gonna be a black tie affair.

12:08.353 --> 12:10.313
- You're engaged?

12:10.313 --> 12:12.357
- Yeah. Sure.

12:12.357 --> 12:15.109
- Oh, David,
that's so exciting!

12:15.109 --> 12:18.154
Oh son, you deserve all
the happiness...

12:18.154 --> 12:19.697
("Cabaret" music begins)
we'll pick this up later.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.532
- Sorry. Alexis made it seem
like everyone knew.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.993
- Oh, they do now, yeah.
- (Sighs)

12:25.787 --> 12:27.538
- Have fun, my darling.

12:27.538 --> 12:30.041
Have fun! You've gestated
long enough beneath my wing.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.001
Now it's time to fly!

12:32.001 --> 12:33.503
- Okay...
- Fly.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.021
The only other time
I've leased one of my girls

14:15.021 --> 14:17.065
is the Halloween when
David was desperate

14:17.065 --> 14:19.609
to be Alanis Morissette.

14:19.609 --> 14:22.070
- Well, glad you think
I'm pulling it off.

14:22.070 --> 14:24.489
- Stevie, I'm so proud of you.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.616
You're really powering
through tonight.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.493
Of course I never doubted you.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.996
- Thank you, but I still
have an act and a half

14:31.996 --> 14:33.289
to prove you wrong.

14:34.499 --> 14:35.458
- Now I suppose David's
announcement

14:35.458 --> 14:37.168
left you a little shaken.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.295
- That's really not it,
Mrs. Rose.

14:39.295 --> 14:40.963
It's just...

14:43.800 --> 14:47.386
I wish I wasn't watching it all
happen from behind the desk.

14:47.386 --> 14:48.679
You know?

14:50.431 --> 14:53.059
It feels like everyone's
growing up all around me.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.066
- You know, before
the "Crows" movie happened,

15:00.066 --> 15:03.528
I too thought there was
no escape from this dark,

15:03.528 --> 15:06.322
troublesome existence that
was my life in this town.

15:07.490 --> 15:11.369
I was as hopelessly crestfallen
as you are right now.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.205
- Uh, I wouldn't say
I'm crest...

15:14.205 --> 15:16.833
- Shhh! Use it.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.167
- I'm sorry?

15:18.167 --> 15:20.503
- Oh, I could so effortlessly
conjure up

15:20.503 --> 15:24.132
the perfect words to bedazzle
your spirits.

15:24.132 --> 15:26.384
That's one of my gifts.
But no.

15:26.384 --> 15:30.179
No, you need to be exactly
where you are.

15:30.179 --> 15:33.975
- Okay, are you talking
about me, or Sally?

15:33.975 --> 15:36.018
- Why, Sally, of course.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.479
You I'm not worried about.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.941
What the hell is your secret,
Stevie?

15:41.941 --> 15:45.153
You just stand your solid
ground,

15:45.153 --> 15:47.780
refusing to be anything but you.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.326
Hm. Never thought I'd say this
about anyone in this town,

15:52.326 --> 15:53.828
but you...

15:53.828 --> 15:55.538
you're very, very cool.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.498
And whether you set sail,
or stay put,

15:57.498 --> 15:59.417

our Sally by the hand,

I'm so glad that
you're all here,

some very special news.

19:49.397 --> 19:50.648
- You're getting married!

19:50.648 --> 19:53.025
- Jocelyn, I'm the one
on the chair!

19:53.025 --> 19:55.903
Now, two years ago,

19:55.903 --> 19:57.822
I went to fill out some
paperwork

19:57.822 --> 20:00.574
for a business license,
and little did I know,

20:00.574 --> 20:02.785
that I would end up meeting
the love of my...

20:02.785 --> 20:05.246
(Cell phone rings)
God!

20:05.246 --> 20:07.081
- Oh, it is me.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.250
Um, I'm sorry, David.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.043
Sorry, it's most likely press.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.255
I-I already know
your engagement news.

20:14.255 --> 20:15.756
(Kiss sounds)

20:15.756 --> 20:18.551
- So wait a minute,
he's marrying you?

20:18.551 --> 20:20.261
- Okay, this shouldn't be
so hard!

20:20.261 --> 20:21.887
- Oh my God, just spit
it out, David!

20:21.887 --> 20:23.347
- Oh my God, fine!

20:23.347 --> 20:25.850
I met someone who changed
my life,

20:27.810 --> 20:30.396
and I don't know where
I'd be without him.

20:30.396 --> 20:33.190
So yes, as we all know now,

20:33.190 --> 20:35.401
Patrick and I are engaged.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.403
All: Ohhh! (Clapping)

20:37.403 --> 20:38.779
Moira: No! Nooooo!

20:38.779 --> 20:40.531
- Oh my God!
Moira: Nooooo!

20:40.531 --> 20:42.867
(Partygoers murmur)

20:42.867 --> 20:44.535
- If it's a bad review, Moira,

20:44.535 --> 20:47.037
I wouldn't trust local critics.

20:47.037 --> 20:49.248
- No.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.875
No, they uh,

20:50.875 --> 20:53.252
they shelved the "Crows" movie.

20:53.252 --> 20:55.254
(Shuddering breaths)

20:55.254 --> 20:57.756
So it's-it's over.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.050
(Whimpers) It's over.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.302
(Sobs)

21:03.053 --> 21:06.223
(Whimpering)

21:06.223 --> 21:08.184
(Sobs loudly)

21:08.184 --> 21:11.687
- Nothing to see here, people.
The party's over.

21:11.687 --> 21:13.105
- Okay. Yeah, you can leave
your champagne flutes.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.690
Unless we still wanna do
a toast?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.275
- No.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.318
- Oh, no? Okay. Everyone leave
the champagne flutes,

21:17.318 --> 21:18.986
thank you.
(Moira sobs)
