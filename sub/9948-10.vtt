00:00.365 --> 00:03.204
Anyone watching,
thinking we know fuck all

00:03.205 --> 00:07.404
about knowing fuck all about owt
needs to watch their backs...

00:07.405 --> 00:10.524
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,

00:10.525 --> 00:12.284
sending prices sky-high!

00:12.285 --> 00:15.844
Literally, literally taking
the grass from its own roots!

00:15.892 --> 00:18.051
And now you've got
your ConDemNation!

00:18.687 --> 00:22.446
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!

00:22.445 --> 00:25.924
Have we had a national
fucking stroke or what?

00:25.925 --> 00:30.844
Is revolution a word or was it
never? Anybody watching

00:30.845 --> 00:35.764
needs to know we cope better than
average with irony in Chatsworth.

00:35.765 --> 00:39.084
Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester

00:39.085 --> 00:41.844
and they charge us for water!

00:41.845 --> 00:47.204
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.

00:47.205 --> 00:50.364
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times...

00:50.365 --> 00:52.964
yak-yak-yak-yak-yak-
yak-yak-yak-yak!

00:52.965 --> 00:56.244
It's not theirs any more.

00:56.245 --> 00:58.724
This is our England now!

00:58.725 --> 00:59.445
Party!

00:59.446 --> 01:01.604
Party!

01:05.845 --> 01:10.164
The way I see it, all living
creatures have three basic needs...

01:10.165 --> 01:11.724
eat...

01:11.725 --> 01:14.085
defecate...

01:15.325 --> 01:17.244
fornicate.

01:17.245 --> 01:20.844
Beyond that - it's all about wants.

01:20.845 --> 01:23.804
Money... health...

01:23.805 --> 01:27.324
belief in a higher power,
of whatever stripe.

01:27.325 --> 01:30.164
Not me. I'm content.

01:30.165 --> 01:32.604
I'm the centre of my universe,

01:32.605 --> 01:34.644
because I'm worth it.

01:34.645 --> 01:36.204
Yeah, right!

01:36.205 --> 01:40.845
Therefore, all I want in life is
recognition for a job well done.

01:47.245 --> 01:48.725
You're going to get caught.

01:50.005 --> 01:51.804
You're going to lose everything.

I've got a win!
Oi, I've won a pound.

02:23.205 --> 02:26.764
You're a fucking one-woman case
for euthanasia you, aren't you?

02:26.765 --> 02:29.645
Here, let's have a look.

02:31.085 --> 02:35.164
Oh, well... Well, here y'are,
look, I tell you what.

02:35.165 --> 02:39.564
Just to save you time... I'll give
you a quid, y'know, a pound.

02:39.565 --> 02:40.724
Pack it in!

02:40.725 --> 02:41.924
Oh?

02:41.925 --> 02:44.205
You've won a tenner, Lillian.

02:45.445 --> 02:47.565
Look at you -
lucky white heather.

02:49.085 --> 02:51.284
Fuck me - you don't know
you're living, eh?

02:51.285 --> 02:52.565
What you on about?

02:52.566 --> 02:55.444
A terrace on Gibson Street

02:55.445 --> 02:58.164
collapsed straight down
into a big hole in the ground.

02:58.165 --> 03:02.604
And two buildings either side barely
touched. Mine shafts or something.

03:02.605 --> 03:06.844
All of fucking Manchester's
on tunnels. I'm surprised
the city hasn't collapsed.

03:06.845 --> 03:09.724
I'd love to see the theatre
of shite collapse! Boom!

03:09.725 --> 03:10.603
Wouldn't we all?

03:10.604 --> 03:11.885
Bye-bye, United!

03:11.886 --> 03:14.364
It's unlikely, admirable
though the thought is.

03:14.365 --> 03:19.484
Salford teeters atop coal seams,
but Satan himself protects Trafford.

03:19.485 --> 03:22.724
Plenty of time to pick up
trivia on the dole, have you?

03:22.725 --> 03:26.244
As a matter of fact, it was my first
job after school, smart arse.

03:26.245 --> 03:27.604
Job?

03:27.605 --> 03:28.724
You had a job?

03:28.725 --> 03:30.844
Wading through shit underground,

03:30.845 --> 03:34.364
shoring up dilapidated
Victorian sewers,

03:34.365 --> 03:38.084
so the fucking Cabinet War Rooms
didn't collapse.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.764
We went to them on a school trip.

03:39.765 --> 03:41.604
Yeah, it was Winnie's hideaway,

03:41.605 --> 03:44.724
in the Second City, in case
the Nazis flattened Westminster.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.604
Second city, my arse!

03:46.605 --> 03:48.084
Get over it.

03:48.085 --> 03:51.244
You know who owns the War Rooms now
and the whole block above?

03:51.245 --> 03:54.204
That fucking nonce who runs
the Great Northern Lottery.

03:54.205 --> 03:55.123
Go away!

03:55.124 --> 03:55.925
Fuck off!

03:55.926 --> 03:57.164
Seriously?

03:57.165 --> 03:58.525
The one who owns
all the late-night porn?

03:58.526 --> 04:01.084
I applied to be one
of the girls on the beds.

04:01.085 --> 04:05.284
You know, Ј1.50 a minute for some
verbal filth and a bit of camel-toe.

04:05.285 --> 04:07.204
Your mother would be proud!

04:07.205 --> 04:10.724
Uses them as his print-works now -
Lottery HQ.

04:10.725 --> 04:12.484
Don't mess about up that way.

04:12.485 --> 04:15.884
One-Eyed Gary tried
to knock that place off

04:15.885 --> 04:20.004
and they gave him six months
in traction, and 27 years.

04:20.005 --> 04:23.724
Fucking disgusting -
a hallowed room,

04:23.725 --> 04:26.844
where Churchill might have
retreated to govern.

04:26.845 --> 04:27.725
But he never did.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.364
Well, he might've done,

04:29.365 --> 04:33.724
if the Germans
hadn't been so... rubbish.

04:33.725 --> 04:37.764
Now it's host to
the Tax on the Poor...

04:37.765 --> 04:43.444
Weekly Draws, Lucky Dips and
Scratch Cards. Fucking 'ell!

04:43.445 --> 04:47.364
What d'you think One-Eyed Gary'd
have got away with if he'd got away?

04:47.365 --> 04:49.364
Well, say he took two rucksacks in,

04:49.365 --> 04:53.444
a box of cards measures about 12
by 5. Probably eight boxes in a bag.

04:53.445 --> 04:56.244
1,000 tickets in each box,
that's 16,000 tickets.

04:56.245 --> 04:59.204
One in ten of those are winners,
so that's 1,600 winners.

04:59.205 --> 05:01.924
Anything over 200 needs a name
and address, so it's a no.

05:01.925 --> 05:05.604
Say nine in ten are under 200,
your average will be, what, 20 quid?

05:05.605 --> 05:08.724
So 20 times 1,400...

05:08.725 --> 05:11.765
About 28 grand. Give or take.

05:13.085 --> 05:15.485
Aw, bless.

05:20.525 --> 05:22.804
Where the fuck'd you get these?

05:22.805 --> 05:26.164
Council archive for those two.
Straight off the internet.

05:26.165 --> 05:27.603
And this from the library.

05:27.604 --> 05:28.805
Didn't know you had a library card.

05:28.806 --> 05:31.125
Fuck off! I robbed it!

05:32.605 --> 05:37.604
You don't steal from libraries.
It's unethical.

05:37.605 --> 05:40.404
So what are we looking at here,
then?

05:40.405 --> 05:42.845
Here, right, we've got, er...

05:46.925 --> 05:50.084
Haven't a fucking clue, mate.
We're going to need some help.

05:50.085 --> 05:54.004
Ventilation shaft,
leading from the War Rooms,

05:54.005 --> 05:57.484
back along this way
to the Pump Room. Oh, yes.

05:57.485 --> 06:01.164
Clean water for the dignitaries
and selected toffs,

06:01.165 --> 06:04.884
in case of an air raid, while
the plebs fry to death up top.

06:04.885 --> 06:06.564
Focus, Frank!

06:06.565 --> 06:12.564
All right, well, the Pump Room can
be accessed via the sewer tunnels,

06:12.565 --> 06:15.844
serviced by maintenance shafts

06:15.845 --> 06:17.364
here, here...

06:17.365 --> 06:20.164
Where does this one come out?

06:20.165 --> 06:22.245
That one is, er...

06:23.925 --> 06:26.324
What's that street there?
Oh, yeah,

06:26.325 --> 06:30.724
that's the car park in
what is now Perseverance Way.

06:30.725 --> 06:33.164
We need a body up top.

06:33.165 --> 06:37.724
Right, surveillance. Observation,
details, time, movement.

06:37.725 --> 06:41.524
What security they've got,
how many shifts, when they change,

06:41.525 --> 06:46.284
cameras - where are they? - Their
coverage, blind-spots, alarm system.

06:46.285 --> 06:49.924
We need to know every cough, spit
and fart of the place or we don't go.

06:49.925 --> 06:54.444
Then we go in through shaft
47/B off Perseverance Way.

06:54.445 --> 06:56.484
Two-man advance, down 80 feet...

06:56.485 --> 06:59.884
harnessed to each other and
the ladder, taking no chances...

06:59.885 --> 07:03.284
to the north by north east tunnel
into the Pump Room, into the vent,

07:03.285 --> 07:07.684
then straight, right, then
straight again for 140 yards

07:07.685 --> 07:09.324
and into the secure room.

07:09.325 --> 07:12.884
We take only what we can carry,
no more than 11 rolls a man.

07:12.885 --> 07:15.644
Greed is not good
in this scenario.

07:15.645 --> 07:18.204
Two journeys, taking no longer
than four hours,

07:18.205 --> 07:21.284
clearing the site with 15 minutes
before the change of shift.

07:21.285 --> 07:24.245
It'll be two weeks before
they realise the cards are gone.

07:30.085 --> 07:33.444
Hold on, hold on.
How do you spell surveillance?

07:33.445 --> 07:35.685
Oh, for fuck's sake!

07:46.285 --> 07:49.444
Boy scouts' day out, is it?

07:49.445 --> 07:51.084
Something like that.

07:51.085 --> 07:54.444
And you wouldn't be straying on
the wrong side of the law, would you?

07:54.445 --> 07:56.364
Nah.

07:56.365 --> 07:58.125
I'm making sandwiches...

07:59.125 --> 08:00.605
for the church social.

08:02.165 --> 08:03.485
Fair enough.

08:06.045 --> 08:07.564
Oh, it's dangerous.

08:07.565 --> 08:09.964
That's why I can't tell you.

08:09.965 --> 08:12.045
Your shout.

08:14.165 --> 08:19.444
It'll probably make a packet,
though, you know, if it comes off.

08:19.445 --> 08:21.324
Really?

08:21.325 --> 08:23.284
Mmm.

You've been watching Deja vu, Andre.

09:01.685 --> 09:03.244
Stop sticking your tits out.

09:03.245 --> 09:04.804
I'm not.

09:04.805 --> 09:06.924
You fucking are
and it looks stupid.

09:06.925 --> 09:10.444
If you didn't keep all the good lines
to yourself, I wouldn't have to!

09:10.445 --> 09:12.884
Well, I have the best voice.

09:12.885 --> 09:18.204
I've got better tits than you, and
I've got a better voice than you.

09:18.205 --> 09:20.605
I'm going for a fag.

09:25.165 --> 09:27.405
All right, Mr Powell.

09:34.685 --> 09:37.764
"I just want to be famous!"
"I've got so much to offer!"

09:37.765 --> 09:39.924
I think they're quite talented.

09:39.925 --> 09:43.444
You see Deja Vu, Andre
selling millions?

09:43.445 --> 09:46.324
It's not about selling records
these days, Grandma.

09:46.325 --> 09:49.364
Shift your head! It's about
uploads and downloads,

09:49.365 --> 09:53.964
number of hits, comments,
feedback, going viral.

09:53.965 --> 09:59.164
Deja Vu, Andre? Do they think
they even know what that means?

09:59.165 --> 10:02.045
They think it's sophisticated.

10:09.885 --> 10:10.845
Where you off to?

10:10.846 --> 10:11.724
Work.

10:11.725 --> 10:13.604
Is that it?

10:13.605 --> 10:16.084
The less I tell you,
the better, you know that.

10:16.085 --> 10:19.164
You can't be charged as an
accomplice and at least Connor has

10:19.165 --> 10:22.724
one parent guaranteed not inside.
Don't ask me about my work, Karen.

10:22.725 --> 10:25.564
Is that that all I'm getting?

10:25.565 --> 10:28.244
What are you digging around for?
Don't you trust me?

10:28.245 --> 10:30.364
Think I'm cheating on you,
fucking around?

10:30.365 --> 10:33.444
I'd have a better excuse than
this if I was. But I'm not...

10:33.445 --> 10:36.964
I meant, is that all
I'm getting - no kiss?

10:36.965 --> 10:38.805
Sorry.

10:40.045 --> 10:41.685
I'm just distracted, that's all.

10:43.805 --> 10:47.964
Fuck it! I've done my bit! There's
no point, I'll only slow you down!

10:47.965 --> 10:50.444
You've been down there,
you know what it's like.

10:50.445 --> 10:52.964
35 years ago.
How's that going to be of any use?

10:52.965 --> 10:56.204
I can barely remember this morning,
let alone 25 years ago.

10:56.205 --> 10:57.924
You said 35.

10:57.925 --> 10:58.565
See? Point proven!

10:58.566 --> 11:01.444
Oh, shut the fuck up, Frank,
and stop whining like a woman!

11:01.445 --> 11:03.204
Who's like a woman?

11:03.205 --> 11:04.765
What you doing here?

11:06.325 --> 11:09.724
I'm coming with you -
the Five Musketeers.

11:09.725 --> 11:12.724
Her share comes out your cut,
you stupid little fuck.

11:12.725 --> 11:15.284
Says who? Who the fuck
put you in charge?

11:15.285 --> 11:17.404
I did - someone has to lead,
and I'm senior.

11:17.405 --> 11:18.484
Ah, like fuck!

11:18.485 --> 11:21.244
All right, fine! Let's put it
to the vote, shall we?

11:21.245 --> 11:24.084
Hands up who wants to follow Shane?

11:24.085 --> 11:27.885
Put your fucking hand down! Right.
We've got a schedule to follow.

12:02.757 --> 12:04.437
What?

12:07.597 --> 12:10.356
Right, well,
very best of luck to you all.

12:10.357 --> 12:13.276
Don't worry,
I am the soul of discretion.

12:13.277 --> 12:15.797
Hey... I don't think so, Frank.

12:17.837 --> 12:19.596
Oh, f...!

12:19.597 --> 12:21.477
Sorry, Frank, we need you down here,

12:21.478 --> 12:23.996
or it's the blind leading the blind.

12:23.997 --> 12:27.796
How the fuck?! I don't want to go.

12:27.797 --> 12:30.916
I don't want to?!
Man, that is such a shit excuse.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.436
Well, I don't - I am not going.

12:33.437 --> 12:35.076
It's up to you.

12:35.077 --> 12:38.156
Think of the karma!

12:38.157 --> 12:39.717
Are you coming?

12:43.357 --> 12:44.957
No.

12:46.117 --> 12:49.476
You fucking monster!

12:49.477 --> 12:52.076
I think I heard a tiny cry, Frank.

12:52.077 --> 12:53.557
Ah, I don't know. Maybe it made it.

12:53.558 --> 12:56.077
You think so?

12:57.597 --> 12:59.797
Right, hang on, mate! I'm coming.

13:04.477 --> 13:05.797
There you go.

13:09.237 --> 13:11.236
Right, you.

13:11.237 --> 13:13.077
Stay sharp, yeah?

13:16.922 --> 13:18.281
Stink!

13:18.282 --> 13:20.162
Tell me that smell ain't your arse.

13:21.562 --> 13:23.681
You said
there'd be a fucking ladder!

13:23.682 --> 13:25.361
Don't talk to me, you murderer.

13:25.362 --> 13:27.240
Yeah? Don't you forget that, Frank.

13:27.241 --> 13:28.082
Why are you so scared, anyway?

13:28.083 --> 13:31.081
I'm not scared. I'm exercising
choice - or trying to.

13:31.082 --> 13:33.921
I think this is a buzz!

13:33.922 --> 13:38.121
Yes, well, you're a Jock.
Being in a sewer's
a step up in the world for you.

13:38.122 --> 13:40.001
Funny! Ooh!

13:40.002 --> 13:41.762
Ah! Careful!

13:43.042 --> 13:44.201
Bastard!

13:44.202 --> 13:47.401
Will you lot stop fucking jabbering,
and concentrate!

13:47.402 --> 13:50.761
Cos if one of you lot falls,
you'll bring me down with you...

13:50.762 --> 13:52.681
and I won't be happy, trust me.

13:52.682 --> 13:54.922
Oooh!

14:06.362 --> 14:07.762
Fuck off!

14:10.482 --> 14:13.441
Terry... Terry? Terry!

14:13.442 --> 14:16.321
I fucking can't... Watch
where you're standing, watch it!

14:16.322 --> 14:18.641
Oh, for fuck's sake, Frank!

14:18.642 --> 14:21.321
Look, here he is...

14:21.322 --> 14:25.561
he seems fine.

14:25.562 --> 14:27.322
Oh!

14:29.682 --> 14:30.722
Bastard.

14:39.322 --> 14:43.162
Right, we'll be out of here in a few
hours. Speaking of which, hurry up.

14:44.722 --> 14:47.321
Yeah, well, my work here is done.

14:47.322 --> 14:50.122
Do I have to fucking hit you?
This way.

14:59.762 --> 15:02.721
Oh, fucking hell, no.

15:02.722 --> 15:03.882
Fuck it.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.761
Wooh! It's hot in here.

15:11.762 --> 15:14.082
There you have it. Your vents.

15:16.242 --> 15:21.601
Fucking look at you -
this is gluttony. It's all
"grab, grab, grab, me, me, me."

15:21.602 --> 15:24.521
Everybody wants.
Give us another one.

15:24.522 --> 15:26.162
It's not fucking right.

15:27.882 --> 15:29.481
Fuck me!

15:29.482 --> 15:30.722
In your dreams.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.361
Careful.

15:40.162 --> 15:41.682
Right... Ruby?

15:42.842 --> 15:44.601
Whoa, whoa, whoa - what's this?

15:44.602 --> 15:48.281
She wants to be a team player -
now she's a team player.

15:48.282 --> 15:48.882
In there?

15:48.883 --> 15:50.121
I'm game.

15:50.122 --> 15:51.642
To get the vent off
the other end, yeah?

15:51.643 --> 15:52.881
Excellent.

15:52.882 --> 15:53.681
You OK?

15:53.682 --> 15:55.482
Damn fucking right. Let's do this.

16:06.842 --> 16:09.961
♪ Don't tell me
that it's time for going solo

16:09.962 --> 16:14.682
♪ You need to knock some sense
into your ego. ♪

16:16.162 --> 16:21.081
'You have been watching
"Deja Vu Andre". '

16:21.082 --> 16:24.401
The Fall, the Mondays,

16:24.402 --> 16:29.281
Stone Roses, and now Deja Vu Andre...

16:29.282 --> 16:31.961
it's Manchester's next gift
to the world.

16:31.962 --> 16:34.321
I've seen worse on TV
on a Saturday night.

16:34.322 --> 16:38.322
She's not doing her schoolwork
because she's concentrating
on her music!

16:39.602 --> 16:41.801
How big do you feel, right now?

16:41.802 --> 16:43.601
I was just being realistic.

16:43.602 --> 16:47.881
Or cynical.
They're showing initiative,
trying to better themselves.

16:47.882 --> 16:51.041
They'll be wanting boob jobs
and to be in magazines...

16:51.042 --> 16:52.962
that's not the work ethic
I'd hoped for.

16:52.963 --> 16:54.721
I believe in them.

16:54.722 --> 16:56.482
Oh, come on!

17:04.482 --> 17:07.521
Shane, I can actually feel you
staring at my arse.

17:07.521 --> 17:08.962
I'm not!

17:26.882 --> 17:28.961
There's ghosts down here, you know.

17:28.962 --> 17:32.521
Fucking hell!
Wise up, Frank, you dick!

17:32.522 --> 17:37.801
Listen, I'm telling you, I can feel
another presence down here.

17:37.802 --> 17:39.201
I can sense it.

17:39.202 --> 17:41.842
It's just us, Frank - no-one else.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.201
Why do you keep saying me name?

17:49.202 --> 17:51.521
I don't keep saying "Jamie", Jamie.

17:51.522 --> 17:54.601
Why do you keep saying "Frank"?

17:54.602 --> 17:56.201
Will you fucking relax?!

17:56.202 --> 18:00.241
Oh! Is it because
I'm going to be the first to die?

18:00.242 --> 18:01.641
What?!

18:01.642 --> 18:05.201
Well, that's what you keep saying,
"Frank this, Frank that."

18:05.202 --> 18:10.201
Gives me identity, buttering me up
before I die a horrible death.

18:10.202 --> 18:13.601
Stop being such a drama queen!

18:13.602 --> 18:16.681
This place gives me the creeps
as it is.

18:16.682 --> 18:18.241
Will you please just...

18:18.242 --> 18:18.722
You all right?

18:18.723 --> 18:20.122
Aaaargh!

18:21.162 --> 18:24.081
Ssssh! What was that?!

18:24.082 --> 18:27.241
I don't know. Who gives a fuck?!
Maybe Jamie saw a spider or summat.

18:27.242 --> 18:28.722
Keep moving.

18:30.202 --> 18:31.202
Go!

18:35.202 --> 18:37.081
What you doing?!

18:37.082 --> 18:38.881
You're supposed to be up there!

18:38.882 --> 18:40.641
It's gone dark. No-one's about.

18:40.642 --> 18:44.521
Thought I'd check everything was all
right. It's fucking sick in here!

18:44.522 --> 18:46.962
Does no-one listen
to a fucking word I say?!

18:50.962 --> 18:54.801
Hey, you're a bit jumpy
for the leader of the pack.

18:54.802 --> 18:56.722
A bit... screamy.

18:57.682 --> 19:00.881
I don't like dark, wet holes.

19:00.882 --> 19:03.082
It's not a crime.

19:04.282 --> 19:07.001
There's almost too many retorts
I could make.

19:07.002 --> 19:08.202
Someone's here!

19:08.203 --> 19:09.682
What are you on about?!

19:12.402 --> 19:14.921
There's a fucking bed!

19:14.922 --> 19:17.322
It'll be here
for the heat off the pipes.

19:20.042 --> 19:22.842
Probably some lazy bastard workman
from years ago.

19:24.442 --> 19:25.842
Probably him.

19:27.162 --> 19:30.321
You have to listen to them.
They're not half bad.

19:30.322 --> 19:35.921
That's not the point!
The point is, we have no control,
and she's exposed.

19:35.922 --> 19:38.321
Exposed to what - the real world?

19:38.322 --> 19:43.081
I think you'll find
my family owns this fucking pub -
put it on the tab!

19:43.082 --> 19:44.080
But I thought...

19:44.081 --> 19:46.562
You're not paid to think!
Leave the thinking to me.

19:46.563 --> 19:48.601
You either shut up or you get out.

19:48.602 --> 19:50.082
Fuck off, bitch!

19:52.202 --> 19:54.721
Hope you've not come in here
for a ruck.

19:54.722 --> 19:56.561
No, why would I do that?

19:56.562 --> 19:58.802
Everyone's kicking off tonight.
Must be something in the air.

19:58.803 --> 20:00.801
No. I'm not here for a ruck.

20:00.802 --> 20:03.802
It's been ages since
I had a good ruck - or a bad one!

20:05.442 --> 20:07.322
White wine!

20:19.842 --> 20:20.881
Shhhh!

20:24.042 --> 20:26.282
Will you shut the fuck up!

20:27.682 --> 20:28.722
Hey, shut the fuck up!

20:28.723 --> 20:29.802
Sssh!

20:31.362 --> 20:32.440
You just said it!

20:32.441 --> 20:34.240
But I didn't mean for you to shout!

20:34.241 --> 20:35.722
Make your fucking mind up!

21:09.562 --> 21:13.881
♪ I really don't think
you're strong enough

21:13.882 --> 21:15.361
♪ Oh, no, no

21:15.362 --> 21:16.641
♪ Oh, no. ♪

21:36.082 --> 21:37.842
Why are they taking so long?

22:26.722 --> 22:30.722
Fuck me. Fair bit of salty yoghurt
got slung then, didn't it?

22:35.722 --> 22:37.561
Are you sniffing me?

22:37.562 --> 22:40.442
Oh, yeah,
I'm a regular little arse sniffer.

22:46.242 --> 22:47.282
What took you so long?!

22:47.283 --> 22:48.842
A security guard came.

22:50.082 --> 22:51.441
Did he see you?

22:51.442 --> 22:53.001
No. Well, I fucking hope not.

22:53.002 --> 22:54.881
What you doing?

22:54.882 --> 22:57.921
You can't go back - we've only got
45 minutes till the shift change.

22:57.922 --> 22:59.042
We can make it.

23:00.082 --> 23:02.921
All right - strictly 30 minutes,
yeah?

23:02.922 --> 23:06.042
You first this time.
I'll ogle your arse.

23:17.642 --> 23:20.402
Oh! Look at this! Ancient porn!

23:22.442 --> 23:24.082
Oh, fuck me!

23:26.562 --> 23:27.921
Circle of life.

23:27.922 --> 23:28.881
Huh?

23:28.882 --> 23:31.841
Shine your... bell-end on that.

23:31.842 --> 23:34.641
If I'm not mistaken...
there's a young lady in here

23:34.642 --> 23:37.921
with an overly developed affection
for vegetables.

23:37.922 --> 23:39.521
How would you know?

23:39.522 --> 23:42.201
How do you think it got here?

23:42.202 --> 23:45.001
Yeah. 35 years ago,
I was a horny little devil,

23:45.002 --> 23:47.921
not unlike yourself -
bigger penis, obviously.

23:47.922 --> 23:51.361
Oh, there you are! Trudy from Wigan.

23:51.362 --> 23:52.682
The whole cucumber?!

23:56.002 --> 23:57.081
Yeah.

23:57.082 --> 24:00.081
There's a pineapple
on the next page...

24:00.082 --> 24:03.442
and not the tinned kind neither.
Go on, knock yourself out.

24:21.802 --> 24:22.482
Frank!

24:22.483 --> 24:25.361
We're all supposed to be in this
together!

24:25.362 --> 24:29.202
Holding a fucking gun to my head?!
I told you I didn't want to come.

24:34.202 --> 24:37.441
Fuck! Fuck! You nearly killed us!

24:37.442 --> 24:41.082
Oh, well... On your own head be it.

24:43.642 --> 24:44.522
Get down!

24:44.523 --> 24:47.282
Or mine...! Shit!

24:54.562 --> 24:56.561
Turn back!

24:56.562 --> 24:58.122
Turn back! Get back!

25:20.322 --> 25:22.162
Frank!

25:44.813 --> 25:46.133
What happened?

25:47.813 --> 25:52.013
What the fuck do you think's
happened? Cover your mouth.

25:53.373 --> 25:55.412
Oh!

25:55.413 --> 25:56.972
Fuck!

25:56.973 --> 25:59.932
Let me clear this stuff away,
we should find a way through.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.093
Give it here.

26:11.733 --> 26:13.492
Are you all right?

26:13.493 --> 26:14.852
I can't move my legs!

26:14.853 --> 26:18.453
Hold onto me. Get a move on!

26:27.133 --> 26:30.372
Fucking hell! We're going to bring
the whole thing down.

26:30.373 --> 26:32.493
There's got to be another way out.

26:35.613 --> 26:37.093
Fucking hell!

26:46.173 --> 26:48.612
What the fuck's happened?

26:48.613 --> 26:53.052
Frank's tried to do a runner and
brought down a couple of supports.

26:53.053 --> 26:55.412
The whole shaft's collapsed.

26:55.413 --> 26:58.253
Well, we aren't getting out
that way.

27:03.613 --> 27:05.612
What the fuck happened to Frank?

27:05.613 --> 27:07.092
He's faking it.

27:07.093 --> 27:09.333
Jamie, he looks dead.

27:20.653 --> 27:22.292
What the fuck?

27:22.293 --> 27:23.572
Told you.

27:23.573 --> 27:25.573
I was NOT faking it!

27:32.013 --> 27:33.212
Any joy?

27:33.213 --> 27:34.371
There's nothing.

27:34.372 --> 27:35.213
Me neither.

27:35.214 --> 27:36.853
Nor me.

27:38.813 --> 27:42.413
You know I don't believe in
mobile phones, fucking cancer.

27:46.533 --> 27:47.653
What are you doing?

27:47.654 --> 27:50.532
Listening out for the emergency
services, it's been ages.

27:50.533 --> 27:52.013
They should be onto us by now.

27:52.014 --> 27:54.012
Certainly hope not.

27:54.013 --> 27:56.812
We're breaking the law, son.
The Filth catch us down here

27:56.813 --> 27:58.492
it won't be soup and blankets,

27:58.493 --> 28:02.292
it'll be a long stretch
in Strangeways. For me anyway!

28:02.293 --> 28:06.612
So, what is the exit strategy then,
dear leader?

28:06.613 --> 28:07.812
Me?

28:07.813 --> 28:10.812
Yeah. You're the one
that dangled the carrot

28:10.813 --> 28:12.332
for the greedy few.

28:12.333 --> 28:15.213
You used the stick on me.
This is on you, all of it.

28:20.653 --> 28:23.452
Built to last, these places.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.773
So... what are we facing here?

28:32.533 --> 28:36.172
Mimi sent me, I'm supposed
to help Jamie out.

28:36.173 --> 28:37.333
Help Jamie do what?

28:37.334 --> 28:39.652
Never ask a man about
his business, Karen.

28:39.653 --> 28:41.892
Well, if I meet a man,
I'll bear that in mind.

28:41.893 --> 28:42.853
Help Jamie do what?

28:42.854 --> 28:44.372
It's collection day.

28:44.373 --> 28:46.372
Jamie's not here.

28:46.373 --> 28:49.132
Well, can I have the books,
then? Mimi'll want...

28:49.133 --> 28:49.733
I will do it.

28:49.734 --> 28:51.213
Fuck off.

28:57.013 --> 28:59.172
You're his grandmother!

28:59.173 --> 29:02.652
And you're his mother, you should
be looking after him yourself.

29:02.653 --> 29:03.692
Erm, I've got business.

29:03.764 --> 29:07.843
Oh yeah, so you have,
gonna go all gangster,

29:07.844 --> 29:10.923
but the child-care arrangements
didn't suit.

29:10.924 --> 29:15.683
Oh listen to you, "child-care",
have you learnt a new language.

29:15.684 --> 29:18.843
Fine. I'll ask somebody else.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.444
See you later, love.

29:21.924 --> 29:23.284
Unbelievable!

29:28.644 --> 29:29.764
It's not a lot of food.

29:29.765 --> 29:32.043
Should've brung more, just in case.

29:32.044 --> 29:34.683
That would've required
planning, forethought.

29:34.684 --> 29:37.043
No-one can hear you
scream down here, you know.

29:37.044 --> 29:39.323
I didn't want to be here,
I was Fritzl-ed!

29:39.324 --> 29:41.724
Who brings rubbers to a robbery?

29:42.924 --> 29:45.844
It's not me,
I always go bareback.

29:49.324 --> 29:50.803
What?

29:50.804 --> 29:54.043
If I was a bloke, you'd be patting
me on the back right now,

29:54.044 --> 29:55.284
calling me a "Stud".

29:56.404 --> 30:00.043
Yeah, good for you,
equal rights for slappers.

30:00.044 --> 30:02.524
Just because I have that,
doesn't mean...

30:04.044 --> 30:07.123
We have to adapt to our environment.

30:07.124 --> 30:10.923
Everything around us
is a potential resource.

30:10.924 --> 30:12.163
What for?

30:12.164 --> 30:13.763
Food, water, air, warmth.

30:13.764 --> 30:17.003
We have no idea how long
we're gonna be down here for.

30:17.004 --> 30:20.043
We need to conserve what we've got.

30:20.044 --> 30:23.243
Split between the five of us?
We'll starve.

30:23.244 --> 30:26.123
No, four, I can go three days
without sustenance.

30:26.124 --> 30:28.323
Only when you're pissed.

30:28.324 --> 30:31.044
We've got no booze left,
you drank it all.

30:32.564 --> 30:35.683
What? Is that it?!

30:35.684 --> 30:38.203
I don't want any.
Not solid, anyway.

30:38.204 --> 30:41.963
I'd sooner have none, than a little.
Remove the option, trick your gut.

30:41.964 --> 30:43.644
You're my fucking hero!

30:45.684 --> 30:49.683
When the need arises,
shit in a bag,

30:49.684 --> 30:52.724
otherwise, we could find ourselves
in real trouble.

30:57.764 --> 31:00.204
Can't you have the pink one?

31:02.044 --> 31:05.564
You be a good boy
for Aunty Gloria, OK?

31:09.044 --> 31:10.683
Are you all right?

31:10.684 --> 31:13.883
Jamie's being a prick.
We've had a fall out.

31:13.884 --> 31:16.403
Why what's happened?
Hasn't hit you, has he?

31:16.404 --> 31:18.683
He wouldn't dare.

31:18.684 --> 31:22.403
But he didn't come
home last night.

31:22.404 --> 31:24.883
Maybe he's seeing someone.

31:24.884 --> 31:28.803
I'm sure that's not true.
Jamie loves you.

31:28.804 --> 31:31.883
Yeah, well, he makes
me wonder, sometimes.

31:31.884 --> 31:34.763
Yeah, I know, can't live with,
can't bury them in quicklime

31:34.764 --> 31:37.043
and go to Vegas
on the insurance money.

31:37.044 --> 31:40.763
Are you sure this is a good time
to go banging on doors,

31:40.764 --> 31:42.243
demanding money?

31:42.244 --> 31:45.403
Yeah, work off
a bit of frustration.

31:45.404 --> 31:46.724
Take someone with you.

31:51.524 --> 31:53.563
There's five of us,

31:53.564 --> 31:56.403
three from the same family,
including you,

31:56.404 --> 31:59.644
all gone at the same time.
They've got to notice.

32:01.804 --> 32:03.883
Yeah, someone must know, right?

32:03.884 --> 32:06.403
I mean, he's married.

32:06.404 --> 32:08.163
Surely you would...

32:08.164 --> 32:13.963
Ah-ah... He's by the book,
hero of his own life story.

32:13.964 --> 32:16.483
Tell no-one,
need to know basis.

32:16.484 --> 32:18.564
Ask him, if you want.

32:27.044 --> 32:29.323
You're not one for
the pillow-talk, are you?

32:29.324 --> 32:33.284
I'll get there.
I'm still getting used to this.

32:34.964 --> 32:38.004
I might not
be around for a few days.

32:40.884 --> 32:42.883
You don't have to answer to me.

32:42.884 --> 32:48.684
Yeah, I know. It's just...
It's just a big job.

32:51.884 --> 32:55.403
I want you to know
these things, that's all.

32:55.404 --> 32:57.444
Keep talking, I'm listening.

33:00.044 --> 33:02.043
50 feet underground...

33:02.044 --> 33:05.603
It's gonna be a four-man crew
more's the pity,

33:05.604 --> 33:08.683
but I've no choice.

33:08.684 --> 33:11.243
Jamie? Jamie?

33:11.244 --> 33:12.683
What?

33:12.684 --> 33:15.803
There's definitely no chance
that you said something

33:15.804 --> 33:18.683
to anyone about where we are?

33:18.684 --> 33:20.603
Karen, maybe?

33:20.604 --> 33:24.004
No, I'm by the book.

33:30.244 --> 33:31.444
Hiya.

33:36.884 --> 33:38.243
I'm sorry.

33:38.244 --> 33:40.804
It is about the support,
and not the outcome.

33:42.524 --> 33:46.523
Fair weather parent, are you?
Supportive when the going's good?

33:46.524 --> 33:48.403
She's smashed it, a big success.

33:48.404 --> 33:49.522
That's brilliant.

33:49.523 --> 33:50.604
Oh, you're happy now are you?

33:50.605 --> 33:53.323
179 hits.

33:53.324 --> 33:55.603
179! Stick that in your pipe.

33:55.604 --> 34:00.043
179 hits in 24 hours.
That's humiliating.

34:00.044 --> 34:01.403
What?

34:01.404 --> 34:06.243
We Tweeted thousands of people
and only 179 bothered.

34:06.244 --> 34:08.844
They're all laughing at us.
We're shit.

34:13.324 --> 34:14.963
I fucking knew it!

34:14.964 --> 34:17.884
Keep the dream alive,
shall we? Oh, baby...

34:21.164 --> 34:23.163
I'll have this as well.

34:23.164 --> 34:24.484
Put it on the tab.

34:25.804 --> 34:30.603
What? I'm making a stew,
you dirty-minded buggers.

34:38.804 --> 34:40.882
Rough day?

34:40.884 --> 34:43.163
You could say that,
Jamie's away,

34:43.164 --> 34:44.963
I'm doing his collections,

34:44.964 --> 34:47.043
except Mimi doesn't think
I'm up to it.

34:47.043 --> 34:49.402
Who are you calling on?

34:49.404 --> 34:51.882
It's Thursday, Mister Quinn,
collection day.

34:51.884 --> 34:53.842
Fuck off, tart.

34:53.844 --> 34:57.883
Every twat they look at me
like they want to fuck me,

34:57.884 --> 34:59.803
or fuck me up, or sometimes both.

34:59.804 --> 35:02.043
Well, I might be able to help.

35:02.044 --> 35:04.564
I'm in the family, now.

35:07.404 --> 35:09.243
Working in here you know everyone.

35:09.244 --> 35:12.524
You'd be amazed what you get
to know about people.

35:14.164 --> 35:15.564
This could be your lucky day.

35:18.825 --> 35:20.665
Be quiet,
otherwise he'll hear us.

35:20.666 --> 35:21.984
Don't move.

35:21.985 --> 35:24.744
Look at the size of it!
It fucking stinks.

35:24.745 --> 35:27.385
Stuck down here,
in this fucking den...

35:34.345 --> 35:35.745
Is there any point in that?

35:35.746 --> 35:38.104
There's every point.

35:38.105 --> 35:39.744
It's still money.

35:39.745 --> 35:41.304
You got any winners?

35:41.305 --> 35:44.305
What's with
all the fucking questions?

36:02.705 --> 36:04.665
'I keep my mouth shut,
and my ears open.

36:04.666 --> 36:07.264
'It's amazing what you can learn.

36:07.265 --> 36:10.384
'This bloke's always drunk by now
cos he works the night shift.

36:10.385 --> 36:12.664
'Picks up a bottle of gin
on the way home.

36:12.665 --> 36:14.744
'Walk right in and take the money.

36:14.745 --> 36:17.304
'Fat Dennis's granny's always there.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.504
'He comes in to buy fig rolls
for her.

36:19.505 --> 36:20.745
'And she's Old School.

36:20.746 --> 36:22.465
'She'll make sure he pays.'

36:25.025 --> 36:26.824
Thursday?

36:26.825 --> 36:29.904
'And that ginger twat
tried to grope my knackers by the

36:29.905 --> 36:33.504
'deep freeze every Saturday shift
for four years.'

36:33.505 --> 36:36.744
Three hours, four figures.
Not too shabby.

36:36.745 --> 36:39.504
Make the money work for you.

36:39.505 --> 36:41.024
Oh, no. That's too much.

36:41.025 --> 36:43.024
Like you said,
you're in the family now.

36:43.025 --> 36:44.824
You've earned it.

36:44.825 --> 36:47.904
All right, Lillian. Having
a bit of bread with your stew?

36:47.905 --> 36:49.104
Oh, no.

36:49.105 --> 36:51.104
This is going up the shitter.

36:51.105 --> 36:54.744
Yesterday's batch is always best.

36:54.745 --> 36:57.104
Well, it's not my shitter,
of course.

36:57.105 --> 36:58.904
Personal and professional.

36:58.905 --> 37:00.305
Don't get confused.

37:02.825 --> 37:05.105
Cheers, Ches!

37:22.825 --> 37:24.825
'You are going to get caught.'

37:28.505 --> 37:30.264
'Don't you trust me?

37:30.265 --> 37:33.504
'You think I'm out cheating on you,
fucking around?'

37:33.505 --> 37:36.544
'You're going to lose everything.'

37:36.545 --> 37:39.584
'Don't have to answer to me.'

37:39.585 --> 37:41.025
'I'm listening.'

37:45.025 --> 37:46.464
'Fucking around.'

37:46.465 --> 37:48.064
'Lose everything.'

37:48.065 --> 37:49.265
'Take it easy, then.'

37:55.265 --> 37:58.584
You got something to fucking say?

37:58.585 --> 37:59.945
What?

38:01.865 --> 38:04.064
You want a fucking go, do you, eh?

38:04.065 --> 38:05.305
Get the fuck off me!

38:07.865 --> 38:09.945
Fuck the lot of you!

38:18.265 --> 38:20.304
Nice one, big chap. Good on you.

38:20.305 --> 38:23.504
Your daughter, knock-out.

38:23.505 --> 38:25.904
Thank you. I like to think so.

38:25.905 --> 38:26.984
37,000 hits?!

38:26.985 --> 38:28.104
Sorry?

38:28.105 --> 38:30.104
I've got a semi here, me.

38:30.105 --> 38:31.184
What?!

38:31.185 --> 38:32.224
They're kids!

38:32.225 --> 38:33.384
Only a semi!

38:33.385 --> 38:34.665
Let me see your phone.

38:44.025 --> 38:46.265
She's like me.
Never pushed a buggy before.

38:48.825 --> 38:50.544
How's she doing?

38:50.545 --> 38:53.304
She's not doing her schoolwork now
cos she's too upset.

38:53.305 --> 38:54.664
She's humiliated.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.664
Ladies!
You think that's humiliating?

38:56.665 --> 38:59.664
Somebody's been fucking about
with Tish's video.

38:59.665 --> 39:00.945
No!

39:03.025 --> 39:04.384
What is that?

39:04.385 --> 39:06.305
Oh. My. God!

39:07.385 --> 39:08.463
Is that a penis?

39:08.464 --> 39:09.745
Somebody's doctored it.

39:09.746 --> 39:11.384
That's disgusting!

39:11.385 --> 39:15.104
Ooh! And it actually looks like
he's sticking it up.

39:15.105 --> 39:17.904
It really does look like
they're naked.

39:17.905 --> 39:19.465
My phone!

39:21.105 --> 39:22.145
Cool.

39:31.745 --> 39:33.384
Oh, babies. You're all right?

39:33.385 --> 39:35.664
Fan-tastic!

39:35.665 --> 39:37.024
42,000 hits!

39:37.025 --> 39:39.744
And that's not even my real boobs!

39:39.745 --> 39:41.304
We're famous. Apparently.

39:41.305 --> 39:43.185
Apparently it wasn't
about the music.

39:43.186 --> 39:45.224
What have you done to my daughter?

39:45.225 --> 39:45.823
Me?!

39:45.824 --> 39:46.945
We're so famous!

39:46.946 --> 39:49.584
We should do a calendar!
Tasteful, like.

39:49.585 --> 39:51.944
Just tit and total Hollywood.

39:51.945 --> 39:53.384
My tits!

39:53.385 --> 39:55.584
They look great!
I could be a porn star!

39:55.585 --> 39:56.905
Come on.

39:58.865 --> 40:00.464
How d'you get on?

40:00.465 --> 40:02.584
Not a natural.

40:02.585 --> 40:04.584
It was about as much fun
as you'd think.

40:04.585 --> 40:05.945
Chesney came with me.

40:07.385 --> 40:08.385
Nothing from him.

40:09.825 --> 40:10.825
He'll turn up.

40:12.385 --> 40:13.385
Thanks again.

40:14.665 --> 40:18.145
Bye!

40:24.465 --> 40:26.304
Something you need to tell us?

40:26.305 --> 40:27.504
No.

40:27.505 --> 40:29.664
That woman, your friend, is worried.

40:29.665 --> 40:32.425
Well, she should really talk
to her husband about that.

40:34.185 --> 40:35.745
Hiya!

40:38.745 --> 40:41.025
'Please leave your message
after the tone.'

40:50.025 --> 40:52.505
Cheer up! Might never happen.

40:54.385 --> 40:56.825
Brilliant, seeing as you're asking.

40:58.025 --> 41:01.224
Pulled in every payment,
and then some.

41:01.225 --> 41:03.744
Even got compliments
on my friendlier approach,

41:03.745 --> 41:05.504
when they realised I'm no mug.

41:05.505 --> 41:07.345
Piece of piss, really.

41:09.225 --> 41:12.224
Oh, come on! At least let me rub
your faces in it a little bit!

41:12.225 --> 41:13.225
There's a problem.

41:13.226 --> 41:14.784
Fuck off! I did a good job.

41:14.785 --> 41:16.584
No, not with you.

41:16.585 --> 41:17.745
They're all missing.

41:17.746 --> 41:19.304
Who?

41:19.305 --> 41:20.584
All of them.

41:20.585 --> 41:23.184
Jamie, Shane, Ruby, Aidan, Frank.

41:23.185 --> 41:27.024
Patty thought Frank was
up to something with Aidan.

41:27.025 --> 41:28.945
When she came round here,
we realised they was all together.

41:28.946 --> 41:30.745
He's still a child.

41:31.865 --> 41:35.184
So, forgive our lack of
congratulations about your success.

41:35.185 --> 41:37.585
But we've got other things
on our minds.

41:39.225 --> 41:40.265
Where?

41:41.585 --> 41:43.465
We've asked everyone
we can think of.

41:45.305 --> 41:47.545
So, if he hasn't told you,
then we are fucked.

42:02.585 --> 42:03.705
'Scuse me.

42:59.025 --> 43:00.025
'It's like when'

43:00.026 --> 43:02.424
a kiddie's been snatched.

43:02.425 --> 43:05.024
Or some poor girl's gone missing,

43:05.025 --> 43:06.944
or a killing's happened.

43:06.945 --> 43:09.425
Somebody always knows something.

43:11.025 --> 43:12.305
Now's your chance.

43:12.306 --> 43:14.504
Come forward,

43:14.505 --> 43:16.664
and we'll go and fetch
our loved ones,

43:16.665 --> 43:17.905
say no more about it.

43:28.225 --> 43:30.064
'You don't have to answer to me.'

43:30.065 --> 43:32.024
'Yeah, I know that.'

43:32.025 --> 43:34.065
It's just... well, it's a big job.

43:37.225 --> 43:39.745
I want you to know about
these things, that's all.

43:41.105 --> 43:43.664
Keep talking. I'm listening.

43:43.665 --> 43:44.785
50 feet underground.

43:44.786 --> 43:46.664
'Fucking men.

43:46.665 --> 43:49.744
'It's always got to be about them.

43:49.745 --> 43:50.945
'What am I doing?

43:50.946 --> 43:53.784
'Look at me. I'm shaking.

43:53.785 --> 43:56.224
'This has got to stop.'

43:56.225 --> 43:57.545
Then hear this...

43:58.665 --> 44:01.664
and I'll say it quiet
so you know I mean it,

44:01.665 --> 44:05.664
if I find anyone's been holding out,

44:05.665 --> 44:07.864
or if something should happen
to any one

44:07.865 --> 44:10.305
of those five souls
lost out there...

44:11.865 --> 44:15.064
then permanent damage
will be done.

44:15.065 --> 44:18.584
'All creatures
have three basic needs.

44:18.585 --> 44:20.064
'Eat,

44:20.065 --> 44:21.584
'defecate,

44:21.585 --> 44:23.424
'fornicate.

44:23.425 --> 44:26.024
'If I had my time again,

44:26.025 --> 44:28.344
'if I get the chance,

44:28.345 --> 44:29.705
'all I want is to live.'

44:32.665 --> 44:33.864
We need blood.

44:33.865 --> 44:35.223
Violence isn't the answer.

44:35.224 --> 44:36.385
You're writing him off already?

44:36.386 --> 44:39.664
What if he's dead or found
shitloads of money and fucked off?

44:39.665 --> 44:40.943
I know where they are, Dominic.

44:40.944 --> 44:41.665
How come you know about it?

44:41.666 --> 44:42.864
Jamie told me.

44:42.865 --> 44:44.064
When?

44:44.065 --> 44:45.584
Are you all right and alive?

44:45.585 --> 44:47.304
M'am, we're down here!

44:47.305 --> 44:48.025
We're through!

44:48.026 --> 44:49.664
Buzzing!

44:49.665 --> 44:51.304
Shit! Jamie!

44:51.305 --> 44:52.945
We've had a setback.
There's been a second collapse.

44:52.946 --> 44:54.304
On my count of three...

44:54.305 --> 44:56.025
Let me go.

45:36.785 --> 45:39.144
Please, Ruby. I'm begging you.

45:39.145 --> 45:40.224
No!

45:40.225 --> 45:42.744
Not even if you were
the last man on earth!

45:42.745 --> 45:44.904
What if them lot all died,

45:44.905 --> 45:47.384
and I was the only survivor?

45:47.385 --> 45:48.784
OK, I tell you what.

45:48.785 --> 45:51.544
If you can suck your own knob,

45:51.545 --> 45:52.984
I might consider it.

45:52.985 --> 45:54.505
Self-fellating?

45:56.225 --> 45:57.264
You dirty cow!

45:57.265 --> 45:58.905
You know I'm up for a challenge.
