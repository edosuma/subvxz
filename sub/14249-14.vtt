00:12.345 --> 00:13.642
Captain?

00:15.782 --> 00:16.976
Report.

00:17.050 --> 00:20.178
It Iooks Iike the Kazon
have retreated, Captain.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.653
We must have hurt them.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.519
Not as bad as they hurt us.

00:23.556 --> 00:25.581
AII engines are off-Iine.

00:25.625 --> 00:28.651
Captain, shieIds are down,
as are aII weapons arrays.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.890
We'd better hope
they don't come back.

00:30.930 --> 00:32.124
We're sitting ducks.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.359
Janeway to Engineering.

00:33.400 --> 00:34.458
What's your status?

00:34.534 --> 00:36.126
We're in bad shape, Captain.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.296
We had to shut down the warp
engines to avoid a breach.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.237
The impuIse engines
are gone, too.

00:41.274 --> 00:43.037
I think
I can give you thrusters,

00:43.143 --> 00:45.611
but I've got
a Iot of casuaIties down here,

00:45.645 --> 00:47.169
I've got to tend to first.

00:47.213 --> 00:48.908
Lieutenant, it's Kurt Bendera.

00:48.948 --> 00:50.313
He's hurt pretty bad.

00:50.350 --> 00:51.476
No.

00:51.518 --> 00:52.576
His consoIe expIoded,

00:52.619 --> 00:53.881
caught him right in the face.

00:53.920 --> 00:56.388
We've got to get him
to Sick Bay right away.

00:56.423 --> 00:57.515
Torres to Sick Bay.

00:57.557 --> 00:59.457
I hope this is urgent,
Lieutenant.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.653
We have our hands fuII
at the moment.

01:01.694 --> 01:03.889
I'm sending up
an emergency transport.

01:03.930 --> 01:06.125
One of my peopIe
is severeIy burned.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.100
Very weII.
We'II do what we can.

01:08.168 --> 01:10.136
More damage reports
coming in, Captain.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.932
There's a huII breach on Deck 4.

01:12.038 --> 01:13.164
Force fieId's in pIace.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.433
Repair crew's on the way.

01:14.507 --> 01:16.304
There have been casuaIties
on aII decks.

01:16.342 --> 01:17.309
No fataIities so far.

01:17.377 --> 01:18.901
Captain, request permission

01:18.945 --> 01:20.412
to give Torres a hand
in Engineering.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.381
Maybe I can heIp
get propuIsion up and running.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.746
Good idea. Go ahead.

01:23.783 --> 01:25.546
Captain, my readings indicate

01:25.585 --> 01:28.383
the navigationaI defIector
has sustained massive damage.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.547
It wiII be necessary
to repair it

01:29.589 --> 01:31.784
before we can achieve
more than thruster power.

01:31.825 --> 01:33.087
Get repair crews on it.

01:33.126 --> 01:34.423
Mr. Kim, I want
a compIete anaIysis

01:34.461 --> 01:36.224
of aII the damage
we've sustained.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.559
Yes, ma'am.

01:37.597 --> 01:38.825
He's not responding.

01:38.865 --> 01:40.492
7 5 miIIigrams of impedrezene.

01:40.533 --> 01:42.467
That might heIp stimuIate
his cardiac functions,

01:42.535 --> 01:44.002
but he sustained
so much injury,

01:44.037 --> 01:44.731
it may be too Iate.

01:44.804 --> 01:45.771
It had no effect.

01:45.839 --> 01:46.897
CorticaI stimuIator.

01:52.212 --> 01:53.702
I'm sorry.

01:53.746 --> 01:55.577
He was too badIy injured.

01:59.018 --> 02:00.918
He saved my Iife once...

02:00.954 --> 02:03.184
near the Cardassian border.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.521
Come in.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.427
Crewman Bendera's dead.

02:16.002 --> 02:17.902
The Doctor
couIdn't do anything.

02:17.937 --> 02:19.928
I'm sorry, Chakotay.

02:20.039 --> 02:21.870
I know you were friends.

02:21.908 --> 02:25.275
WiII you arrange
a memoriaI service?

02:25.311 --> 02:27.438
I'II get right on it.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.608
Was there something eIse?

02:31.651 --> 02:32.743
Yes.

02:32.785 --> 02:33.809
Like it or not,

02:33.853 --> 02:36.617
it seems we're in a situation
where the ruIes have changed,

02:36.656 --> 02:40.649
and, maybe, if we're going
to survive out here,

02:40.693 --> 02:42.991
we have to start changing, too.

02:43.096 --> 02:44.859
What do you mean?

02:45.932 --> 02:47.991
When we first started
our trip home,

02:48.101 --> 02:49.625
you made a conscious decision

02:49.702 --> 02:51.465
to treat Voyager
as a StarfIeet ship

02:51.538 --> 02:54.302
with a StarfIeet crew
foIIowing StarfIeet ruIes.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.671
That's right.

02:55.708 --> 02:59.439
StarfIeet works weII
in the AIpha Quadrant.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.572
But out here...

03:03.283 --> 03:05.717
maybe we shouId be thinking
more Iike the Maquis.

03:05.752 --> 03:09.210
The Maquis had to survive
on their own.

03:09.255 --> 03:11.416
We were up against
insurmountabIe odds.

03:11.457 --> 03:13.687
We had to create our own
opportunities for success

03:13.726 --> 03:16.286
because nobody was wiIIing
to heIp us.

03:16.329 --> 03:18.695
Sound Iike anybody you know?

03:18.731 --> 03:21.325
If you're suggesting
we abandon our principIes

03:21.401 --> 03:23.062
just because
we're out of haiIing range...

03:23.136 --> 03:26.765
Captain, this was the fourth
attack in two weeks.

03:26.839 --> 03:29.137
We've Iost three crew members
to the Kazon.

03:29.175 --> 03:31.643
A dozen more have sustained
serious injuries.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.201
This ship has taken
so much damage,

03:33.246 --> 03:35.339
we'II be Iucky to get warp drive
on Iine again,

03:35.381 --> 03:39.408
and we can count on the fact
that the Kazon wiII be back.

03:45.024 --> 03:48.460
I don't think we can afford
to keep doing business as usuaI.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.908
A Iot of us can say
we're aIive today

05:47.947 --> 05:49.847
because of Kurt Bendera.

05:51.451 --> 05:53.976
There was never a better man
to have at your side,

05:54.020 --> 05:57.581
never anyone more wiIIing
to take on the tough jobs.

05:57.623 --> 06:00.922
The first time I met him
was in a mining community

06:00.960 --> 06:02.825
on TeIfas Prime.

06:02.862 --> 06:05.353
Some of the miners objected
to my sense of humor

06:05.398 --> 06:08.333
and decided they shouId break
a few of my bones.

06:08.401 --> 06:10.494
There were four of them
and one of me,

06:10.570 --> 06:12.094
and I was taking a beating.

06:12.171 --> 06:15.629
SuddenIy, this man I'd never
seen before came out of nowhere

06:15.708 --> 06:17.835
and evened things up.

06:17.877 --> 06:19.344
We stood back to back,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.904
and pretty soon
the others decided

06:21.948 --> 06:25.076
my sense of humor
wasn't so bad after aII.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.642
I thanked the man.

06:26.686 --> 06:28.881
He just grinned and said,

06:28.921 --> 06:31.185
''I Iike a good fight.''

06:31.224 --> 06:34.853
He was my friend
from that moment on.

06:34.894 --> 06:37.624
And he kept fighting
the good fight...

06:37.663 --> 06:39.688
right up to the end.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.662
I'II miss him.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.442
Ensign.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.551
Captain,
can I ask you something?

07:08.594 --> 07:09.583
Of course.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.859
Now that the Kazon
have stepped up their attacks,

07:11.898 --> 07:13.388
a Iot of peopIe think
that we're not going

07:13.433 --> 07:14.525
to make it out of here aIive.

07:14.567 --> 07:17.263
I'd Iike to know
what you have to say about that.

07:18.304 --> 07:20.829
Is there anything you
have to say about that?

07:20.907 --> 07:23.535
I assure you,
you can speak freeIy.

07:23.576 --> 07:26.136
I'd give them what they want.

07:26.179 --> 07:27.908
Give them the repIicators
and the transporters

07:27.947 --> 07:29.107
and whatever eIse

07:29.282 --> 07:30.544
it is they're after.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.051
I'm sure you reaIize
that wouId be a vioIation of...

07:33.085 --> 07:35.144
I know aII about
the Prime Directive.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.519
But you know what?

07:36.556 --> 07:38.456
The Federation
is 70,000 Iight-years away.

07:38.491 --> 07:40.288
What does it matter
what these peopIe do

07:40.326 --> 07:41.850
to each other
with our technoIogy?

07:41.894 --> 07:44.021
I appreciate your concerns,
Crewman,

07:44.063 --> 07:46.725
but Iet me make it
absoIuteIy cIear--

07:46.766 --> 07:48.495
I'II destroy this ship

07:48.534 --> 07:51.298
before I turn any part of it
over to the Kazon.

07:56.876 --> 07:59.174
So that's how the Maquis
wouId do it, hmm?

08:06.719 --> 08:07.811
It's aII right, Commander.

08:07.854 --> 08:08.821
I know Hogan's upset.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.516
He and Bendera were cIose.

08:10.556 --> 08:11.523
But that's not why he thinks

08:11.557 --> 08:12.956
we shouId give the Kazon
what they want.

08:12.992 --> 08:15.187
I think I've made
my position cIear on that.

08:15.228 --> 08:17.355
You have, but a Iot
of the crew feeI

08:17.396 --> 08:19.261
they haven't had the chance
to voice their opinions.

08:19.298 --> 08:21.027
This isn't a democracy,
Chakotay.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.058
I can't run this ship
by consensus.

08:23.135 --> 08:24.227
A Iot of the Maquis feeI

08:24.303 --> 08:25.998
the Federation
abandoned them years ago.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.768
You may be wiIIing to die
for Federation principIes,

08:28.841 --> 08:30.866
but they're not.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.342
I can't beIieve you'd
support that man's position.

08:33.379 --> 08:35.539
I don't, but isn't
there something

08:35.581 --> 08:37.344
in between
your position and his?

08:40.620 --> 08:42.019
Deck 3.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.111
AII I'm saying, Captain,

08:43.155 --> 08:45.487
is that maybe there's
a IittIe room for fIexibiIity

08:45.525 --> 08:47.686
in interpreting
StarfIeet's protocoIs.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.558
FrankIy, I'm not sure
they were ever intended

08:49.595 --> 08:50.619
for situations Iike this.

08:50.663 --> 08:52.927
I haven't seen any evidence
that they've Iet us down.

08:52.965 --> 08:54.626
Maybe this situation
with the Kazon

08:54.667 --> 08:55.725
is the first exampIe.

08:55.768 --> 08:58.032
Maybe we have to examine
StarfIeet's principIes

08:58.104 --> 08:59.867
with a coId eye,
and ask ourseIves

08:59.939 --> 09:01.497
if they're reaIIy
appIicabIe here.

09:01.574 --> 09:04.008
Computer, hoId turboIift.

09:04.043 --> 09:08.207
Commander, if you have
a specific suggestion

09:08.247 --> 09:09.714
pIease feeI free to make it.

09:11.851 --> 09:14.149
Make a deaI-- an aIIiance.

09:15.321 --> 09:16.583
With the Kazon?

09:16.622 --> 09:18.522
With one of their factions,
or two.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.992
If we had the OgIa
and the ReIora

09:21.027 --> 09:23.689
as our aIIies, the others
wouId be afraid to touch us.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.390
Nothing we've been through
with the Kazon

09:25.431 --> 09:26.989
wouId Iead me to beIieve
they're trustworthy.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.967
I can't imagine making
a deaI with them.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.559
With aII due respect...

09:30.636 --> 09:32.604
maybe that's because
your imagination is Iimited

09:32.638 --> 09:33.605
by StarfIeet protocoIs.

09:34.941 --> 09:38.069
As Captain, you're responsibIe
for making decisions

09:38.110 --> 09:40.010
in the best interest
of your crew,

09:40.046 --> 09:42.606
and I think you have
to ask yourseIf...

09:42.648 --> 09:45.048
if you're doing that.

09:59.231 --> 10:00.323
Come in.

10:03.669 --> 10:05.466
Captain.

10:05.538 --> 10:07.233
This is unexpected.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.171
I've been in your quarters
before.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.438
Indeed, but so rareIy

10:11.477 --> 10:13.502
that I can remember
each instance.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.377
VuIcan spice tea-- hot.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.078
And it was aIways
at a time when you were

10:20.119 --> 10:21.677
particuIarIy troubIed.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.188
Right, as usuaI.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.486
Oh... thank you.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.719
Commander Chakotay has proposed

10:27.760 --> 10:30.957
that we make an aIIiance
with one of the Kazon factions.

10:30.997 --> 10:32.897
We wouIdn't give them
weapons or technoIogy,

10:32.932 --> 10:36.163
but we wouId pIedge
to support and defend them

10:36.235 --> 10:37.668
if they're attacked.

10:37.703 --> 10:40.035
I am sure that made
you uncomfortabIe.

10:40.106 --> 10:41.767
How can I consider it?

10:41.841 --> 10:44.036
I can't just waIk away
from the precepts

10:44.076 --> 10:46.010
StarfIeet has Iaid out
for us--

10:46.045 --> 10:48.843
you don't deaI with outIaws;
you don't invoIve yourseIf

10:48.881 --> 10:51.406
in the poIiticaI machinations
of other cuItures.

10:51.450 --> 10:52.883
It goes against
everything I beIieve,

10:52.918 --> 10:54.044
everything I've trained for,

10:54.086 --> 10:56.714
everything experience
has taught me.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.189
Quite right.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.249
Do I hear a ''however'' coming?

11:00.292 --> 11:03.352
You are perceptive, Captain.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.422
I beIieve Commander Chakotay's
suggestion does have merit.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.897
HeIp me understand that.

11:09.969 --> 11:13.405
When I was a young man,
a great visionary named Spock

11:13.439 --> 11:15.339
recommended an aIIiance
between the Federation

11:15.374 --> 11:17.638
and the KIingon Empire.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.474
This produced a major dispute.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.639
The KIingons, after aII,
were outIaws,

11:21.681 --> 11:26.209
empIoying vioIence and brutaIity
in order to buiId their empire.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.948
I myseIf spoke out
against such a coaIition,

11:28.988 --> 11:31.388
but the aIIiance was forged,

11:31.424 --> 11:33.221
and it brought a stabiIity
to the Quadrant

11:33.259 --> 11:35.989
that had not been there
for 200 years.

11:36.028 --> 11:39.156
Spock's suggestion,
so controversiaI at first,

11:39.198 --> 11:41.758
proved to be the cornerstone
of peace.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.666
There are some differences here.

11:43.736 --> 11:46.204
By aIIying ourseIves
to one faction,

11:46.238 --> 11:48.900
we'd be giving that faction
more power than the others.

11:48.974 --> 11:50.407
That wouId cIearIy affect

11:50.443 --> 11:53.037
the internaI poIitics
of aII the Kazon.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.047
I understand your concern,

11:55.114 --> 11:58.242
but, remember, it wouId onIy be
a temporary arrangement

11:58.284 --> 12:00.809
since we are on our way
out of this Quadrant.

12:00.853 --> 12:02.411
In the meantime,

12:02.455 --> 12:04.480
it might bring stabiIity
to the region

12:04.523 --> 12:06.354
and security for us.

12:07.359 --> 12:08.326
Once we're gone,

12:08.360 --> 12:10.328
they'II probabIy go back
to their infighting.

12:10.362 --> 12:13.354
Perhaps.

12:13.399 --> 12:15.026
But even temporary stabiIity

12:15.067 --> 12:17.433
can bring an appreciation
for peace.

12:19.705 --> 12:23.232
This fIower is a rare hybrid.

12:23.309 --> 12:27.268
As far as I know, it exists
nowhere eIse in the gaIaxy.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.713
I created it
by grafting a cutting

12:29.749 --> 12:33.981
from a South American orchid
onto a VuIcan favinit pIant.

12:34.019 --> 12:36.351
I doubted the graft wouId take,

12:36.388 --> 12:39.255
and, indeed, the pIant
was sickIy at first.

12:39.291 --> 12:41.987
However, after a few weeks,

12:42.027 --> 12:44.996
both pIants adapted
to their new condition

12:45.064 --> 12:50.468
and, in fact, became stronger
than either had been aIone.

12:53.005 --> 12:56.771
ConsequentIy,
after much consideration,

12:56.809 --> 13:01.371
I've decided to seek an aIIiance
with one of the Kazon factions.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.313
Captain, you can't be serious.

13:03.349 --> 13:04.316
This goes against...

13:04.350 --> 13:05.317
Ensign...

13:05.351 --> 13:07.649
I'II be gIad to discuss
my reasoning with you

13:07.686 --> 13:09.085
at a more appropriate time.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.453
However, this meeting is
not to debate the decision,

13:11.490 --> 13:13.754
but to decide how to pursue it.

13:13.793 --> 13:16.023
Captain... if I may.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.585
Yes, Mr. NeeIix.

13:17.630 --> 13:21.396
We're not far from a
pIanet known as Sobras,

13:21.433 --> 13:23.230
where there's a Kazon settIement

13:23.302 --> 13:26.203
inhabited by a faction
known as the Pommar.

13:26.238 --> 13:27.933
I have an acquaintance there--

13:28.007 --> 13:29.907
someone who owes me some favors.

13:29.942 --> 13:32.410
Some rather Iarge favors,
actuaIIy.

13:32.478 --> 13:35.242
Perhaps I couId meet with him
and sound him out.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.306
Is he authorized
to speak for his maje?

13:37.349 --> 13:40.876
Not exactIy, but he does
have the maje's ear.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.979
This wouId be
strictIy informaI,

13:43.022 --> 13:46.185
but it might give us a reading
on the possibiIity

13:46.225 --> 13:48.557
without the risk
of actuaI confrontation.

13:48.594 --> 13:49.754
Good idea.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.353
Proceed, Mr. NeeIix.

13:51.397 --> 13:55.197
Why don't we just contact Seska
and form an aIIiance with her?

13:55.234 --> 13:57.361
ActuaIIy, that's a good idea.

13:57.436 --> 13:58.994
You've got to be kidding.

13:59.104 --> 14:00.935
Not at aII.
Seska has been trying

14:00.973 --> 14:03.100
to forge an aIIiance
among the Kazon.

14:03.175 --> 14:05.143
She wouId jump at the chance
to get our support.

14:05.311 --> 14:06.141
She's right.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.270
If we went through Seska,

14:07.313 --> 14:09.543
at Ieast we couId aIIy ourseIves
with the Nistrim.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.072
I think it's a bad idea.

14:11.116 --> 14:13.641
You can't have it both ways,
Commander.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.483
If you want to get in the mud
with the Kazon,

14:15.521 --> 14:17.887
you can't start compIaining
that you might get dirty.

14:19.225 --> 14:21.455
Fine.
I'II taIk with Seska.

14:21.493 --> 14:22.482
No.

14:22.528 --> 14:24.359
You've been through
too much with her.

14:24.396 --> 14:27.832
Mr. NeeIix, prepare to take
your shuttIe to Sobras.

14:27.867 --> 14:31.530
In the meantime, I'II
make contact with Seska.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.936
Dismissed.

14:45.918 --> 14:49.581
Captain's Log, Stardate 49337.4.

14:49.622 --> 14:51.351
After sending a subspace message

14:51.390 --> 14:53.790
to Seska
and the Nistrim Maje CuIIuh,

14:53.826 --> 14:55.987
we have a received
a quick response.

14:56.095 --> 14:57.619
Captain Janeway.

14:57.663 --> 15:00.393
Commander Chakotay.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.458
I must say we were surprised
to hear from you.

15:03.502 --> 15:05.333
Are you wiIIing
to meet with us?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.235
You've made
an interesting proposaI.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.274
I've discussed it with Seska,

15:09.341 --> 15:10.831
and she assures me
that you wouId not make

15:10.910 --> 15:13.811
this gesture
unIess you were sincere.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.246
I wiII taIk with you.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.806
I suggest we rendezvous.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.647
We'II transmit
coordinates to you.

15:19.685 --> 15:21.380
If you don't mind, Captain,

15:21.420 --> 15:22.910
we'd prefer to choose
the coordinates.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.617
Fine.
Transmit them to us.

15:25.658 --> 15:28.422
We'II meet
in approximateIy 20 hours.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.360
I must say, Captain,

15:30.396 --> 15:33.456
I Iook forward
to this opportunity.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.326
HeIIo, my friends.

16:06.365 --> 16:08.799
PIease, don't Iet me interrupt.

16:13.372 --> 16:16.500
I was hoping to find
my good friend JaI Tersa here.

16:16.575 --> 16:18.338
Has he been in tonight?

16:20.412 --> 16:22.073
Thank you.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.554
Tersa, my friend.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.528
It couId be dangerous
sneaking up on a man Iike that.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.658
I'd never dream
of sneaking up on you,

16:41.700 --> 16:43.395
but you were so engrossed in...

16:43.435 --> 16:44.925
whatever it is you're doing.

16:45.070 --> 16:47.163
A puzzIe.

16:47.239 --> 16:49.605
What brings you here,
TaIaxian?

16:49.641 --> 16:50.869
I'm good at puzzIes.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.308
Perhaps I couId heIp.

16:52.344 --> 16:54.744
The dancer showed it to me.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.247
By moving onIy two rods,

16:56.281 --> 16:58.442
this dodecahedron
can become an icosahedron.

16:58.484 --> 16:59.473
Hmm.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.180
She said she'd spend the night
with the man who couId soIve it.

17:03.255 --> 17:06.952
A spIendid motivation,
to be sure.

17:06.992 --> 17:11.088
I just might be abIe

17:11.130 --> 17:12.994
to make your night
a memorabIe one.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.000
You know how to soIve this?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.002
I might...

17:17.036 --> 17:18.401
if you'II hear me out first.

17:22.273 --> 17:26.438
My fortunes have changed
since we Iast met, Tersa.

17:26.478 --> 17:28.241
I've become a person
of some infIuence

17:28.280 --> 17:30.544
aboard a starship
known as Voyager.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.381
You must think us very isoIated.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.387
Everyone knows that.

17:35.421 --> 17:38.117
It's probabIy the onIy reason
you were aIIowed in here,

17:38.157 --> 17:40.182
especiaIIy after Iast time.

17:41.260 --> 17:43.125
Oh.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.926
A simpIe misunderstanding.

17:46.031 --> 17:50.127
Uh... Tersa, I know you have
the ear of your first maje,

17:50.169 --> 17:52.069
as I do of our Captain.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.731
And we couId be quite usefuI
to both of them.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.331
Go on.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.605
My Captain is interested
in taIking to your maje

17:59.645 --> 18:02.307
to discuss a possibIe aIIiance.

18:02.347 --> 18:05.748
Do you think he'd have
any interest in such a meeting?

18:05.784 --> 18:07.376
An aIIiance?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.444
Between the Kazon-Pommar
and the Federations?

18:09.488 --> 18:11.854
An interesting thought,
isn't it?

18:11.957 --> 18:13.447
You're coming with us.

18:13.492 --> 18:16.086
Tersa, expIain to them.

18:16.128 --> 18:17.186
We're friends.

18:17.229 --> 18:18.856
I have no idea
who this person is.

18:18.964 --> 18:21.990
Some Iunatic who sat down
and started babbIing.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.764
I guess you'II be spending
the night aIone.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.406
You've made a good choice.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.849
The Nistrim wiII be
a potent aIIy.

18:39.885 --> 18:43.548
We want to make sure the Nistrim
wiII aIso be an honorabIe aIIy,

18:43.589 --> 18:47.252
that you'II adhere
to the conditions we estabIish.

18:47.292 --> 18:50.056
You can Iet
aII the Kazon factions know

18:50.095 --> 18:52.063
that Voyager has formed
a coaIition with you

18:52.097 --> 18:53.257
and wiII be an aIIy

18:53.298 --> 18:55.926
to any Nistrim ship
or outpost we encounter.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.935
In addition, we're prepared
to provide emergency suppIies

18:59.004 --> 19:01.268
when needed--
food, medicine, cIothing.

19:01.340 --> 19:02.398
What we wiII not provide

19:02.474 --> 19:04.942
is any of our technoIogy
or weaponry.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.535
Understood.

19:06.612 --> 19:10.742
Just one other detaiI...

19:10.782 --> 19:13.114
an exchange of crew members.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.950
An exchange?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.182
Yes.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.713
I'm sure you'II agree
that our aIIiance

19:19.758 --> 19:22.249
shouId represent
a genuine partnership.

19:22.294 --> 19:24.592
Perhaps you shouId define that.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.154
It's obvious.

19:26.198 --> 19:28.723
Federation crew on my ship.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.327
Nistrim crew on yours.

19:31.370 --> 19:35.033
Maje, I think that's a detaiI
we couId work out Iater.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.074
I can assure you

19:36.108 --> 19:38.406
that I wouId never agree
to that.

19:38.443 --> 19:41.844
It seems a naturaI extension
of your own proposaI.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.075
We don't have to decide
everything right now.

19:44.116 --> 19:47.142
I wiII determine
what we decide and when.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.619
Yes, Maje.

19:50.656 --> 19:55.286
I won't have a woman
dictate terms to me.

19:55.327 --> 19:57.386
CuIIuh...

19:57.429 --> 19:58.657
I found the idea

19:58.697 --> 20:01.495
of an aIIiance
with you distastefuI.

20:01.533 --> 20:04.161
I was wiIIing to expIore
the possibiIity,

20:04.203 --> 20:07.661
but now I see my instincts
were dead on.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.833
TaIk to her.

20:09.908 --> 20:11.569
TeII her to be reasonabIe.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.304
This meeting is over.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.288
As soon as your maje Iearns
I'm being imprisoned,

20:25.324 --> 20:26.791
-he'II be outraged!
-Hurry up!

20:26.825 --> 20:27.792
He won't Iook kindIy

20:27.826 --> 20:29.589
on anyone who's made
such an egregious error.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.789
What are you charging me with?!

20:33.799 --> 20:34.959
How Iong wiII I be heId?

20:35.000 --> 20:36.126
Move.

20:36.168 --> 20:39.569
WeII, I assume you'II at Ieast
Iet me confer with counseI.

20:39.638 --> 20:43.130
I have the abiIity
to reward handsomeIy

20:43.208 --> 20:45.176
anyone who shows me
a bit of understanding.

20:47.713 --> 20:49.203
Is that a baby?

21:09.034 --> 21:10.865
My name is NeeIix.

21:10.902 --> 21:13.029
I-I'm TaIaxian.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.198
I'm Mabus.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.640
My friends and I are Trabe.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.746
They hurt you.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.147
I wasn't waIking
quickIy enough for them.

21:26.585 --> 21:27.984
Let's get the bIeeding stopped.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.385
Then I'II cIean it.

21:31.256 --> 21:32.883
Why are they hoIding you?

21:32.924 --> 21:35.688
They seem to be detaining
anyone who isn't Kazon.

21:35.727 --> 21:38.662
SeveraI of our group
have been taken for questioning,

21:38.697 --> 21:40.722
but so far, none of them
have come back.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.666
How Iong have you been here?

21:42.701 --> 21:43.998
Five days.

21:44.169 --> 21:46.467
They attacked us in space.

21:46.505 --> 21:48.996
20 of our group died.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.669
We've Iost nine more
since they put us in prison,

21:51.743 --> 21:53.608
incIuding most of
the governing counciI.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.203
I'm the onIy one Ieft.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.043
The Kazon won't be satisfied

21:57.115 --> 21:59.049
untiI you've aII
been annihiIated.

21:59.084 --> 22:01.678
If we've Iearned anything,
it's how to survive.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.888
Did you notice
how many guards they have posted

22:05.924 --> 22:07.050
at the entrance to the prison?

22:07.092 --> 22:09.287
OnIy two.
I guess they assume

22:09.328 --> 22:12.161
this pIace is so secure
they don't need any more.

22:12.197 --> 22:13.824
Why do you ask?

22:13.865 --> 22:17.062
We don't pIan to sit here
whiIe they kiII us one by one.

22:17.102 --> 22:19.627
We were abIe
to get a message through

22:19.671 --> 22:22.196
to another Trabe vesseI
before we were boarded.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.969
HeIp is on the way.

22:26.244 --> 22:27.802
Can we count on you?

22:31.516 --> 22:33.814
Captain's Log, suppIementaI.

22:33.852 --> 22:36.343
We're on our way to rendezvous
with Mr. NeeIix.

22:36.388 --> 22:38.253
I can onIy hope
that he had more Iuck

22:38.290 --> 22:39.917
with the Kazon than we did.

22:39.958 --> 22:42.426
Captain, we're approaching
the coordinates.

22:42.461 --> 22:43.894
AII stop.

22:45.464 --> 22:46.988
I don't see any trace of him.

22:47.065 --> 22:49.932
Long-range sensors indicate
no sign of Mr. NeeIix's shuttIe

22:49.968 --> 22:51.833
within a radius
of two Iight-years.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.667
The Kazon have him.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.265
We cannot jump to concIusions.

22:56.341 --> 22:57.865
He may simpIy have been deIayed.

23:00.278 --> 23:02.439
We'II hoId position here
for two hours.

23:02.481 --> 23:06.008
If he hasn't shown up by then,
we'II go to Sobras.

23:19.131 --> 23:22.828
Lieutenant, couId you
fiII us in a IittIe?

23:22.868 --> 23:24.927
There are aII kinds of rumors
fIying around

23:25.003 --> 23:26.732
about what's going on
with the Kazon.

23:26.772 --> 23:28.205
Nothing's going on yet.

23:28.273 --> 23:31.265
The Captain's taIk with Seska
feII apart pretty quickIy.

23:31.343 --> 23:33.777
Nothing's going
to come of aII this.

23:33.812 --> 23:36.212
B'EIanna, you were
Seska's friend.

23:36.248 --> 23:38.512
CouIdn't you get word to her,
try to work things out?

23:38.550 --> 23:39.642
No, I couIdn't.

23:39.684 --> 23:40.651
I don't understand...

23:40.685 --> 23:42.243
Hogan, it's gone too far.

23:42.287 --> 23:44.585
Seska isn't the person
we thought she was.

23:44.623 --> 23:47.387
I don't trust her anymore.

23:47.426 --> 23:51.556
Even if it means
us getting home in one piece...

23:51.596 --> 23:53.996
or do you agree
with our Captain

23:54.065 --> 23:56.898
that hoIding onto our technoIogy
is worth dying for?

23:56.935 --> 23:58.994
Who are you to be second-
guessing Captain Janeway?

23:59.037 --> 24:00.436
The hardest thing
you have to worry about

24:00.505 --> 24:02.268
is keeping
that diIithium chamber fiIIed.

24:02.340 --> 24:03.864
She is doing the best she can
to get us home,

24:03.975 --> 24:05.533
and if you don't Iike
the way she's doing it,

24:05.610 --> 24:07.544
I reaIIy don't want
to hear about it.

24:07.579 --> 24:10.446
Is that cIear?

24:10.482 --> 24:12.780
PerfectIy.

24:20.959 --> 24:22.893
Some of the chiIdren
are too weak to run.

24:22.928 --> 24:24.020
We'II have to carry them.

24:24.062 --> 24:26.360
We can use another
pair of strong arms.

24:26.398 --> 24:28.093
You can count on me.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.328
I can't promise we'II
get out of here aIive,

24:30.368 --> 24:32.666
but if we stay here,
we'II die anyway.

24:32.704 --> 24:34.968
I'd rather go out
fighting, myseIf.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.876
That one might be a probIem.

24:39.911 --> 24:42.243
He's the kind
who'II start shooting

24:42.280 --> 24:44.214
at the first sign of troubIe.

24:44.249 --> 24:45.341
I'II keep an eye on him.

24:51.289 --> 24:52.449
This may be it.

24:52.491 --> 24:53.685
Be ready.

24:56.528 --> 24:58.120
Stay back.

25:11.409 --> 25:12.808
Get back!

25:12.844 --> 25:14.641
Against the waIIs.

25:24.122 --> 25:25.089
Now!

25:25.123 --> 25:26.522
Let's go, Iet's go-- come on!

25:26.558 --> 25:27.547
Come on, everyone, Iet's go.

25:27.592 --> 25:28.581
Come on!

25:29.961 --> 25:30.928
Let's go.

25:30.962 --> 25:32.156
Come on.

25:33.398 --> 25:35.229
Come on.

25:35.267 --> 25:36.234
Nice work, my friends.

25:36.268 --> 25:37.235
Let's go.

25:37.269 --> 25:38.258
Come on.

25:46.645 --> 25:48.738
AII right, that's it.
We're going after him.

25:48.813 --> 25:50.906
Mr. Paris, set a course
for Sobras, fuII impuIse.

25:50.949 --> 25:51.916
Aye, Captain.

25:51.950 --> 25:52.917
Tuvok, arm the phaser banks

25:52.984 --> 25:54.212
and Ioad the forward
torpedo bays.

25:54.252 --> 25:56.345
We don't know what the Kazon
have in store for us.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.379
ShieIds at fuII power.

25:58.423 --> 26:00.550
YeIIow AIert.
AII hands at the ready.

26:00.592 --> 26:01.889
Captain.

26:01.927 --> 26:03.292
What is it?

26:03.328 --> 26:04.488
Ships.

26:04.529 --> 26:06.554
Kazon ships
on Iong-range sensors.

26:06.598 --> 26:07.690
CIosing fast.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.097
Confirmed, Captain.

26:09.134 --> 26:10.829
On screen.

26:12.571 --> 26:16.302
It appears to be an armada,
and their weapons are powered.

26:16.374 --> 26:17.466
Red AIert.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.887
Power aII weapon systems
and stand ready.

26:30.922 --> 26:33.186
Mr. Kim, haiI the Iead ship.

26:33.224 --> 26:34.714
They're haiIing us, Captain.

26:34.759 --> 26:36.590
I'II put it on screen.

26:36.628 --> 26:38.721
HeIIo, Captain.

26:38.763 --> 26:41.323
I'd Iike you to meet
my good friend Mabus.

26:41.366 --> 26:44.199
We've just escaped
from the Kazon-Pommar.

26:44.235 --> 26:45.930
What are you doing
on a Kazon ship?

26:45.971 --> 26:48.235
They're Trabe vesseIs, actuaIIy.

26:48.306 --> 26:51.275
Everything the Kazon have,
they stoIe from the Trabe.

26:51.343 --> 26:54.369
Mabus wiII teII you aII about it
over a sumptuous dinner.

26:54.446 --> 26:57.074
The food hasn't been
very good where we've been.

26:57.115 --> 27:00.346
I Iook forward to it.

27:04.356 --> 27:06.017
I was eight years oId
when it started.

27:06.057 --> 27:08.355
I wasn't even
particuIarIy aware of the Kazon.

27:10.395 --> 27:12.295
They Iived in restricted areas

27:12.330 --> 27:14.924
that chiIdren
weren't aIIowed to go near.

27:18.503 --> 27:22.132
I didn't know they Iived
in poverty, and fiIth...

27:24.275 --> 27:27.642
I didn't know they were
persecuted by the Trabe poIice.

27:28.947 --> 27:31.814
I was toId they were vioIent
and dangerous

27:31.850 --> 27:34.341
and had to be kept isoIated,

27:34.386 --> 27:36.820
so they wouIdn't get Ioose
and kiII us,

27:36.855 --> 27:39.187
which is exactIy what they did,

27:39.224 --> 27:41.715
but we brought it on ourseIves.

27:41.760 --> 27:43.785
The Trabe treated them
Iike animaIs--

27:43.828 --> 27:46.888
fenced them in, encouraged them
to fight amongst themseIves

27:46.931 --> 27:48.364
so they wouIdn't turn on us

27:48.400 --> 27:53.667
and sat by whiIe they turned
into a vioIent, angry army.

27:53.705 --> 27:56.503
When they finaIIy reaIized
we were their true enemy,

27:56.574 --> 27:58.542
we didn't stand a chance.

27:58.610 --> 27:59.668
I was Iuckier than most.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.177
A friend's father
grabbed me and took me

28:01.246 --> 28:03.237
with his famiIy to
one of the starships

28:03.314 --> 28:04.542
that managed to escape.

28:04.582 --> 28:06.072
I can stiII remember...

28:06.117 --> 28:08.108
it happened so fast.

28:08.153 --> 28:09.780
One minute...

28:09.821 --> 28:13.951
I was a happy chiId
pIaying in a fieId;

28:13.992 --> 28:17.985
the next, an orphan,
exiIed in space.

28:18.163 --> 28:21.621
It strikes me that in many ways,

28:21.666 --> 28:23.600
we're in the same predicament--

28:23.635 --> 28:26.695
separated from the Iives
we knew,

28:26.738 --> 28:28.330
searching for home.

28:31.643 --> 28:34.043
A goaI you may weII achieve,
Captain,

28:34.079 --> 28:35.512
but the Kazon have refused

28:35.547 --> 28:37.515
to aIIow us to find
a new homeworId.

28:37.582 --> 28:39.379
Every time we try
to settIe somewhere,

28:39.417 --> 28:41.681
they attack and drive us away.

28:41.720 --> 28:46.316
We're scattered, Iike nomads,
with no home and IittIe hope.

28:49.661 --> 28:51.686
It happened over 30 years ago

28:51.730 --> 28:53.698
and the Kazon are stiII
trying to punish you?

28:53.732 --> 28:55.927
RemarkabIe, isn't it?

28:56.000 --> 28:59.492
Most of the Trabe
who persecuted the Kazon

28:59.537 --> 29:02.005
are either dead
or oId men by now.

29:02.073 --> 29:05.736
Most of us were chiIdren
when the uprising occurred,

29:05.810 --> 29:08.677
and our chiIdren are innocent,

29:08.713 --> 29:11.682
but the Kazon's
desire for revenge

29:11.716 --> 29:13.616
is as strong as ever.

29:20.492 --> 29:23.154
How are you abIe to transmit to
us without your crew knowing it?

29:23.194 --> 29:24.559
WeII, that's for me
to worry about.

29:24.596 --> 29:28.862
Let's just say I'm very famiIiar
with communications protocoIs.

29:28.967 --> 29:32.425
Now, wiII you Iet me taIk
to Seska?

29:32.470 --> 29:35.598
Not without some proof
you can be trusted.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.437
She and I knew each other
for a Iong time.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.272
She knows that I can be trusted.

29:39.344 --> 29:40.368
Just Iet me taIk to her.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.913
I'II convey your message.

29:42.947 --> 29:44.676
Contact me tomorrow,
and I'II Iet you know

29:44.716 --> 29:46.411
if she's wiIIing to taIk to you.

29:56.161 --> 29:57.719
Before the uprising,

29:57.762 --> 30:00.595
the Trabe were known
as a highIy evoIved species.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.463
They produced schoIars
and artists

30:02.500 --> 30:03.831
who were wideIy admired,

30:03.868 --> 30:07.065
and their technoIogy was among
the finest in the Quadrant.

30:07.105 --> 30:09.665
No one reaIIy knew
about the Kazon

30:09.707 --> 30:12.175
and how they were being treated.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.177
Why not?

30:13.211 --> 30:14.974
HoIding another cuIture
in virtuaI sIavery

30:15.013 --> 30:17.072
isn't the kind of thing
that wouId go unnoticed.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.638
You have to understand,

30:18.716 --> 30:20.650
the Trabe were rich
and powerfuI.

30:20.685 --> 30:21.982
They manipuIated information

30:22.020 --> 30:23.715
about the conditions
on their pIanet,

30:23.755 --> 30:26.087
and no one wanted to risk
offending them

30:26.124 --> 30:28.149
and Iosing opportunities
for trade.

30:28.193 --> 30:30.491
It seems to me that they've
Iearned their Iesson.

30:30.528 --> 30:32.359
Mabus and his peopIe
have freeIy acknowIedged

30:32.397 --> 30:34.592
that they were responsibIe
for what happened to them.

30:34.632 --> 30:36.827
StiII, I do not see that

30:36.868 --> 30:39.268
it is a particuIarIy good
idea to form an aIIiance

30:39.304 --> 30:40.635
with the bIood-enemies
of the Kazon.

30:40.672 --> 30:43.436
We risk uniting
aII the factions against us.

30:43.508 --> 30:45.669
The onIy thing
the Kazon agree on now

30:45.743 --> 30:47.768
is that we
are their common enemy.

30:47.846 --> 30:49.939
It's hard to imagine
it getting much worse.

30:50.014 --> 30:50.981
The Trabe have a Iot of ships

30:51.049 --> 30:52.880
and a Iot of weapons
in that convoy.

30:52.917 --> 30:55.477
I think this aIIiance wouId be
better than none at aII.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.987
I'd rather not be
in the position

30:57.021 --> 30:58.386
of making an aIIiance at aII,

30:58.423 --> 31:02.291
but that may be a Iuxury
we simpIy don't have.

31:02.327 --> 31:07.060
My gut teIIs me we don't have
any friends among the Kazon.

31:07.098 --> 31:09.566
As for the Trabe...

31:09.601 --> 31:12.092
I beIieve that peopIe have
a capacity to change.

31:12.136 --> 31:13.728
It's aIways been
StarfIeet's poIicy

31:13.771 --> 31:14.897
to deaI with new species

31:14.939 --> 31:17.601
on a basis of openness
and trust...

31:17.675 --> 31:19.540
untiI proven otherwise.

31:25.383 --> 31:27.442
Captain, I'm gIad to see you.

31:27.485 --> 31:28.452
I wanted to thank you

31:28.486 --> 31:30.351
for the use
of your medicaI faciIities.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.515
We have very few doctors.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.752
Everyone seems to be
in generaIIy good condition.

31:34.792 --> 31:36.851
MaInutrition
is the most common probIem,

31:36.895 --> 31:39.625
but it's easiIy aIIeviated
with bio-nutrient suppIements.

31:39.664 --> 31:40.631
Thank you, Doctor.

31:40.665 --> 31:41.632
How much Ionger do you need?

31:41.666 --> 31:43.634
I'd say Iess than an hour.

31:43.668 --> 31:45.295
WiII you waIk with me?

31:45.336 --> 31:46.325
Of course.

31:50.441 --> 31:52.204
I've been thinking...

31:52.277 --> 31:54.336
about our conversation
at dinner.

31:54.412 --> 31:55.379
Mm-hmm.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.211
About the things we share,
and it seems to me

31:58.249 --> 32:00.376
we couId be of mutuaI
benefit to each other.

32:00.418 --> 32:01.908
Go on.

32:01.953 --> 32:02.920
What wouId you say

32:02.954 --> 32:05.286
to the possibiIity
of our joining forces--

32:05.323 --> 32:07.723
my starship and your convoy?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.421
CIearIy we'd be a stronger
force if we did that.

32:10.461 --> 32:11.519
We couId traveI together

32:11.562 --> 32:13.689
for as Iong as it's
advantageous to both of us.

32:13.731 --> 32:16.564
Maybe we'II find our way
out of Kazon territory,

32:16.601 --> 32:19.365
and you couId settIe
on a new homeworId.

32:19.404 --> 32:21.031
It's a reasonabIe idea, Captain.

32:21.072 --> 32:22.130
I have no objection,

32:22.173 --> 32:24.266
but it wouId onIy benefit
your group and mine.

32:24.342 --> 32:25.309
There are other Trabe

32:25.343 --> 32:27.208
who wouIdn't enjoy
the same protection.

32:27.245 --> 32:29.509
I wonder...

32:29.547 --> 32:32.880
if you might consider a
somewhat more... boId pIan.

32:32.917 --> 32:34.578
TeII me.

32:34.619 --> 32:35.984
Together, Voyager and the Trabe

32:36.020 --> 32:37.715
wouId be a force
to be reckoned with.

32:37.755 --> 32:39.620
Suppose we took
advantage of that

32:39.657 --> 32:42.353
and asked the representatives
of aII the Kazon factions

32:42.393 --> 32:44.418
to join us
at the bargaining tabIe.

32:44.462 --> 32:47.522
In order to achieve what?

32:47.565 --> 32:48.896
Peace.

32:48.933 --> 32:51.265
Together, we wouId represent
a stabiIizing force

32:51.302 --> 32:52.792
in this part of the Quadrant--

32:52.837 --> 32:54.600
bring the factions together,

32:54.639 --> 32:56.539
convince them
that an end to vioIence

32:56.607 --> 32:58.541
wouId be in everyone's
best interest.

32:58.576 --> 33:00.874
Think about it.

33:00.912 --> 33:02.880
I beIieve it couId work.

33:02.947 --> 33:05.211
It's a message from Voyager.

33:06.351 --> 33:09.582
They've formed an aIIiance...
with the Trabe!

33:09.620 --> 33:11.417
The Trabe?

33:11.456 --> 33:16.257
They're caIIing for a conference
of aII first majes.

33:16.294 --> 33:18.194
How couId this have happened?

33:18.229 --> 33:21.494
It happened because you
Iet Voyager sIip away,

33:21.532 --> 33:23.397
right into the hands
of the Trabe,

33:23.434 --> 33:26.699
by insisting on that
ridicuIous exchange of crews.

33:26.738 --> 33:29.468
I couId not Iet
the negotiations

33:29.540 --> 33:31.371
be dictated by that woman.

33:31.442 --> 33:34.343
That's becoming
a tired refrain, CuIIuh.

33:34.379 --> 33:36.870
One day that attitude
wiII be your undoing.

33:36.948 --> 33:38.848
Watch your tongue.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.713
Or what?

33:41.753 --> 33:44.586
I'm carrying your chiId.

33:44.622 --> 33:47.955
I don't think you'd do anything
to jeopardize him.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.986
We can stiII turn this
to our advantage.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.895
We have a crewman on Voyager

33:53.931 --> 33:56.832
who's wiIIing to provide
information to us.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.803
There's Iong-term potentiaI
in that arrangement.

33:59.837 --> 34:01.600
We mustn't Iose sight of it.

34:01.639 --> 34:04.836
You're not suggesting
we go to this conference--

34:04.909 --> 34:07.002
that we come running
Iike a CaIogan dog

34:07.078 --> 34:08.636
when the Federations caII?

34:08.713 --> 34:12.012
CouId you risk being the onIy
maje who doesn't attend?

34:12.050 --> 34:15.018
Of course you'II go

34:15.053 --> 34:16.577
and Iisten.

34:16.621 --> 34:19.054
Nothing shouId be
negotiated there--

34:19.090 --> 34:21.353
not at the point
of a Federation weapon,

34:21.391 --> 34:23.621
but you can Iearn a great deaI,

34:23.661 --> 34:26.630
assess the mood
of the other majes.

34:26.664 --> 34:29.462
Find out the strength
of the Trabe convoy.

34:31.702 --> 34:33.498
You may be right.

34:33.538 --> 34:36.701
You can come out of this a hero.

34:36.774 --> 34:41.710
You can use this conference
to unite the factions,

34:41.779 --> 34:45.476
eradicate the Trabe
once and for aII,

34:45.516 --> 34:49.315
and take Voyager as a trophy.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.184
Ooh.

34:54.292 --> 34:57.784
Captain's Log, Stardate 49342.5.

34:57.829 --> 35:00.457
NeeIix has returned from Sobras
where he Iearned

35:00.498 --> 35:02.557
a disturbing piece
of information

35:02.600 --> 35:05.228
that may require us
to rethink our pIans.

35:05.269 --> 35:06.861
He was a Takrit--

35:06.904 --> 35:09.873
a band of mercenaries
that operates in this system.

35:09.974 --> 35:10.872
What was he doing

35:10.975 --> 35:12.442
when the Kazon-Pommar
arrested him?

35:12.477 --> 35:15.935
My contact on the pIanet said
that he was making a sketch

35:16.114 --> 35:17.706
of the conference site,
and beIieve me,

35:17.782 --> 35:19.613
the Takrit are not
known for their art.

35:19.650 --> 35:21.015
Who sent him?

35:21.052 --> 35:22.917
That's as much information
as I got.

35:23.020 --> 35:25.921
So someone wants to sabotage
this conference.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.857
One of the majes.

35:27.892 --> 35:29.382
Why miss a chance
to wipe out your rivaIs

35:29.427 --> 35:31.292
whiIe they're together
in one room?

35:31.329 --> 35:32.296
If that is true,

35:32.330 --> 35:34.230
then one of them wiII
undoubtedIy try to Ieave

35:34.265 --> 35:35.562
before the meeting is finished.

35:35.600 --> 35:37.158
Captain, I think you
shouId consider

35:37.201 --> 35:38.463
not going to the conference.

35:39.470 --> 35:42.564
No. If I can heIp bring
stabiIity to this Quadrant,

35:42.607 --> 35:45.440
I'm not going to waIk away
because of a rumor.

35:45.510 --> 35:48.638
A rumor that must be taken
seriousIy, nonetheIess.

35:48.713 --> 35:50.078
Agreed.

35:51.182 --> 35:52.877
Commander...

35:52.917 --> 35:56.250
monitor aII the Kazon vesseIs
carefuIIy

35:56.287 --> 35:58.118
and Iook out for any
suspicious ship movement

35:58.156 --> 35:59.145
near the surface.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.181
Keep us on a constant
transporter Iock

36:01.225 --> 36:03.489
so we can beam out
at the first hint of troubIe.

36:03.528 --> 36:07.294
Tuvok, NeeIix, you're with me.

36:21.512 --> 36:24.037
I gave a great deaI of thought
to the shape of the tabIe.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.583
I finaIIy decided on a triangIe.

36:26.617 --> 36:28.209
Your group wouId
sit on one side.

36:28.252 --> 36:30.049
The majes wouId
occupy the other two.

36:30.087 --> 36:32.715
Does that seem appropriate?

36:32.757 --> 36:37.694
Have you heard anything more
about the matter we discussed?

36:37.728 --> 36:39.593
Don't taIk about that here.

36:39.630 --> 36:40.927
It couId mean my head.

36:40.965 --> 36:44.696
Does the tabIe shape
seem acceptabIe?

36:44.735 --> 36:47.226
Tersa, this time I am here
with a powerfuI starship.

36:47.271 --> 36:49.535
You better be teIIing me
everything you know.

36:49.574 --> 36:51.132
I am, I swear.

36:51.175 --> 36:53.939
I want to thank you
for making it possibIe

36:54.078 --> 36:56.046
to have the conference
here on Sobras.

36:56.113 --> 36:57.978
My maje has
rewarded me handsomeIy

36:58.049 --> 36:59.846
for the prestige
it affords him.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.853
If there is any further way
I can be of service,

37:02.954 --> 37:04.717
pIease Iet me know.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.596
He hasn't heard anything more,
but he's frightened.

37:12.630 --> 37:15.599
He must beIieve
something's going to happen.

37:17.201 --> 37:20.432
The first majes
of the Kazon Order.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.370
Minnis of the Pommar.

37:29.614 --> 37:31.946
Surat of the MostraI.

37:36.420 --> 37:38.752
Loran of the Hobii.

37:43.027 --> 37:45.791
VaIek of the OgIamar.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.768
And CuIIuh of the Nistrim.

37:55.840 --> 37:59.571
Captain, we seem destined
to encounter each other.

37:59.644 --> 38:03.136
This is Mabus,
a governor of the Trabe.

38:03.214 --> 38:06.581
Maje CuIIuh, I'm gratified
to be meeting you Iike this.

38:06.617 --> 38:08.847
I hope we'II be abIe
to come to terms.

38:08.886 --> 38:10.945
I never thought I'd see the day

38:10.988 --> 38:14.719
when any of us wouId sit
at a tabIe with the Trabe.

38:14.759 --> 38:16.488
Times change, Maje.

38:16.527 --> 38:18.017
Perhaps.

38:18.062 --> 38:19.290
ShaII we?

38:24.402 --> 38:27.838
Our gracious host, JaI Minnis,
has provided food and drink

38:27.872 --> 38:29.999
to make our discussions
more pIeasant.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.305
We appreciate your coming.

38:32.376 --> 38:35.868
We hope this wiII Iead
to a new cIimate of peace.

38:36.013 --> 38:37.503
Peace?

38:37.581 --> 38:39.014
With the Trabe?

38:39.050 --> 38:41.041
Forgive me if I'm
a bit skepticaI.

38:41.118 --> 38:42.745
I understand.

38:42.787 --> 38:46.382
After decades of antagonism,
you're bound to be suspicious.

38:46.424 --> 38:51.623
But sureIy, everyone here is
tired of constant vioIence.

38:51.662 --> 38:55.564
Aren't you reaIIy trying
to get us to reIax our guard

38:55.599 --> 38:58.500
so the Trabe
can conquer us again?

38:58.536 --> 38:59.628
How couId we do that?

38:59.670 --> 39:01.103
We're scattered and dispirit.

39:01.138 --> 39:03.800
AII we ask for
is a chance to find

39:03.874 --> 39:06.968
a new homeworId
and settIe peacefuIIy.

39:07.044 --> 39:08.568
Excuse me.

39:17.355 --> 39:20.347
Captain Janeway,
I'm curious as to the nature

39:20.391 --> 39:23.087
of this aIIiance
you've struck with the Trabe.

39:24.628 --> 39:27.995
EspeciaIIy since you refused
my offer of a simiIar pact.

39:28.032 --> 39:32.366
I found the goaIs of the Trabe
to be compatibIe with our own.

39:32.403 --> 39:34.837
I represent an organization
which is devoted

39:34.872 --> 39:36.635
to peacefuI coexistence
among peopIe.

39:36.674 --> 39:38.539
The Trabe want
nothing more than that.

39:38.609 --> 39:42.807
The Trabe have aIways
wanted peace for themseIves,

39:42.880 --> 39:45.144
but we paid the price.

39:45.182 --> 39:46.274
They Iived in Iuxury

39:46.350 --> 39:48.341
and we Iived
in squaIor and misery.

39:48.419 --> 39:50.216
What I fear, Captain,

39:50.254 --> 39:52.620
is that this union
you've made with the Trabe

39:52.656 --> 39:55.625
is an effort to force us
to capituIate.

39:55.659 --> 39:59.857
If so, we assure you
it is doomed to faiIure.

39:59.897 --> 40:02.024
I won't pretend
that our aIIiance

40:02.066 --> 40:05.035
wasn't an attempt to
make a show of strength.

40:05.069 --> 40:07.936
SeparateIy, we and the Trabe
are vuInerabIe.

40:07.972 --> 40:10.065
Together, we are stronger.

40:10.107 --> 40:13.235
Are you threatening us,
Captain?

40:13.310 --> 40:16.939
It is important that you
understand our determination,

40:17.081 --> 40:18.343
but it's not a threat.

40:18.382 --> 40:19.644
It's an offer.

40:19.683 --> 40:22.777
A negotiated peace
among aII of us wouId provide

40:22.820 --> 40:24.685
a greater stabiIity
in this Quadrant.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.486
How couId that do anything
but benefit us aII?

40:27.525 --> 40:30.983
I can't speak for aII of you,

40:31.061 --> 40:35.259
but I, for one, don't think
we can trust this proposaI.

40:35.299 --> 40:38.632
A woman and a Trabe--

40:38.669 --> 40:40.933
how can we Iisten to them?

40:40.971 --> 40:44.304
I find you nothing
but a hypocrite, Captain--

40:44.341 --> 40:47.310
aIIying yourseIf to the greatest
viIIains this Quadrant

40:47.344 --> 40:48.402
has ever known.

40:48.479 --> 40:50.003
If this is where your

40:50.080 --> 40:53.015
revered Federation vaIues
have taken you,

40:53.050 --> 40:54.483
I want no part of it.

40:54.518 --> 40:58.682
GentIemen, aIIow me to confer
with my Federation coIIeagues.

40:58.722 --> 41:01.213
PIease, have some refreshments
and Iet us continue

41:01.258 --> 41:03.158
in a few moments.

41:03.194 --> 41:06.857
Captain, wouId you
pIease join me?

41:13.237 --> 41:17.196
Captain, I reaIIy need
to taIk to you now.

41:18.876 --> 41:20.207
Get down!

41:22.379 --> 41:25.439
What is this, Captain?

41:25.516 --> 41:26.540
It's a trap!

41:26.617 --> 41:28.141
Take cover!

41:30.387 --> 41:32.218
Voyager, Red AIert.

41:32.256 --> 41:33.245
We're on it.

42:09.159 --> 42:11.252
You've ruined
what wouId have been

42:11.295 --> 42:13.923
the greatest step
toward peace in decades.

42:13.964 --> 42:16.023
Peace? A massacre?

42:16.066 --> 42:18.796
I couId have decimated
the Kazon Ieadership.

42:18.836 --> 42:20.929
It wouId have taken them
years to recover.

42:20.971 --> 42:22.939
You pIanned this whoIe thing

42:22.973 --> 42:26.340
and used our goodwiII to make
sure you were successfuI.

42:26.410 --> 42:27.741
You don't know the Kazon.

42:27.811 --> 42:29.711
There's no deaIing with them.

42:29.747 --> 42:31.214
VioIence is aII they understand.

42:31.282 --> 42:33.477
Or perhaps it's aII
you understand.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.246
You're naive, Captain.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.981
It's cIear you have
no understanding

42:37.087 --> 42:39.317
of the harsh reaIities
of this part of space.

42:39.356 --> 42:41.324
What I tried to do was
done as much for you

42:41.358 --> 42:42.655
as it was for us.

42:42.693 --> 42:45.753
I'm not gratefuI,
and I want you off my ship.

42:45.796 --> 42:48.993
Chief, beam our former guest
back to his vesseI.

42:49.033 --> 42:50.728
Captain, don't do this.

42:50.768 --> 42:51.735
You're going to need us.

42:51.769 --> 42:52.736
I don't think so.

42:52.770 --> 42:54.931
The Kazon wiII be determined
to seek revenge.

42:54.972 --> 42:57.338
How can this one ship
hope to survive?

42:57.374 --> 42:59.274
Not by making deaIs
with executioners.

42:59.343 --> 43:00.776
Energize.

43:06.016 --> 43:07.677
I wouId suggest we
depart before the Kazon

43:07.718 --> 43:09.242
have a chance to return
to their ships.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.311
Janeway to Paris.
Get us out of here.

43:11.355 --> 43:12.845
Aye, Captain.

43:21.465 --> 43:24.332
There's no question we're
more vuInerabIe now than ever.

43:24.368 --> 43:25.767
We have to take every measure

43:25.803 --> 43:27.930
to make sure we're prepared
for an attack.

43:28.038 --> 43:30.905
I want continuaI diagnostics
on aII ship's systems.

43:30.941 --> 43:33.933
I wiII scheduIe additionaI
battIe driIIs for aII hands.

43:34.078 --> 43:36.069
Mr. NeeIix,
what about our food suppIies?

43:36.146 --> 43:37.613
We're in good shape, Captain.

43:37.681 --> 43:40.514
We shouIdn't have to stop
anywhere for severaI weeks.

43:40.551 --> 43:42.519
Good. Lieutenant,
what's the condition

43:42.553 --> 43:44.316
of our propuIsion systems?

43:44.355 --> 43:46.949
We have a reasonabIe
suppIy of antimatter.

43:46.991 --> 43:48.288
Barring any major probIems,

43:48.325 --> 43:49.952
we shouId have
maximum performance

43:49.994 --> 43:52.155
of both warp
and impuIse engines.

43:52.196 --> 43:54.858
There's just one more thing
I want to say.

43:54.898 --> 43:59.392
I hope there's a Iesson
for aII of us in this.

43:59.436 --> 44:00.368
AIthough some of the species

44:00.404 --> 44:01.928
we've encountered here
have been peacefuI,

44:01.972 --> 44:05.635
others seem governed onIy
by their own seIf-interests.

44:05.676 --> 44:07.667
This appears to be
a region of space

44:07.745 --> 44:09.372
that doesn't have many ruIes.

44:09.446 --> 44:11.471
But I beIieve we can
Iearn something

44:11.548 --> 44:13.573
from the events
that have unfoIded.

44:13.651 --> 44:16.245
In a part of space
where there are few ruIes,

44:16.286 --> 44:20.279
it's more important than ever
that we hoId fast to our own.

44:20.324 --> 44:22.918
In a region where shifting
aIIegiances are commonpIace,

44:22.993 --> 44:27.555
we have to have something
stabIe to reIy on, and we do--

44:27.598 --> 44:30.931
the principIes and ideaIs
of the Federation.

44:30.968 --> 44:33.596
As far as I'm concerned,

44:33.637 --> 44:38.165
those are the best aIIies
