Okay, thanks, Oscar.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.794
Dad, your cab's outside.

18:47.835 --> 18:49.629
Better hurry.
The meter's probably running.

Hey.
Thanks again.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.729
I meant thank you
for sticking up for me

19:06.771 --> 19:07.772
with your dad.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.565
Well, you know.

19:10.108 --> 19:10.984
I know.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.152
You are a good man.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.780
And you are a good man

Come on, guys, I'm ready.

You know that
meter's running.

19:26.457 --> 19:27.541
Well, goodbye, Roy.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.753
Sorry again
about your ankle.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.588
Just think
of my busted tendon

19:32.630 --> 19:34.090
as an extension
of your style.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.343
And I'm sorry I was such
a pain in the ass.

19:37.384 --> 19:38.552
Ah, don't worry
about it.

Nice seeing you, Pop.
Okay, buddy.

What's a week
from Thursday?

The, uh, deposition.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.871
What?

20:04.912 --> 20:06.622
I thought you told him
not to pursue that.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.624
I did, but it doesn't mean
he listened.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.501
He's my dad.
Unbelievable.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.337
At least you and I
are on the same side.

You watched Part Two?

"You keep your friends close
but your enemies closer."

Where my wife sleeps,

20:47.413 --> 20:49.123
and my children play
with their toys!"

Welcome back, friend.
