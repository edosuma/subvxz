<i>Just you wait, it won't be long</i>

01:02.228 --> 01:07.274
The man in black will soon be here

01:07.650 --> 01:12.237
With his cleaver's blade so true

01:12.822 --> 01:16.533
He'll make mincemeat out of you!

01:16.785 --> 01:18.243
You're out.

01:39.474 --> 01:42.893
I told you to stop singing
that awful song!

01:43.812 --> 01:45.646
Didn't you hear me?

01:49.067 --> 01:51.276
That same cursed song over and over!

02:14.050 --> 02:17.886
Dear me, that's heavy.

02:38.867 --> 02:40.325
What's the matter?

02:41.244 --> 02:44.454
I told those kids to stop
singing that awful song,

02:44.706 --> 02:47.082
but they sing it all day long.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.585
As if we haven't heard
enough of that murderer already.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.336
Ah, leave 'em alone.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.797
As long as we can hear 'em singing,

02:53.923 --> 02:56.258
at least we know
they're still there.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.636
Yes, I guess you're right.

10,000 MARKS' REWARD -
WHO IS THE MURDERER?

04:37.193 --> 04:40.696
"Little Kurt Klawitzky and his sister Klara
have been missing since June 11th.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.699
Evidence leads us to believe
the children were victims of a crime

04:43.950 --> 04:47.244
similar to that committed
last fall against the Doering siblings".

04:53.334 --> 04:56.295
What a pretty ball you have there.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.341
What's your name?

05:02.385 --> 05:04.594
Elsie Beckmann.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.624
Didn't Elsie come with you?

05:34.876 --> 05:38.211
No, she didn't.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.276
Pretty!

06:08.951 --> 06:10.619
Thank you.

06:21.964 --> 06:25.133
A thrilling new chapter, Mrs. Beckmann.
Passionate and moving.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.887
Just a moment, Mr. Gehrke.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.308
Tell me, Mr. Gehrke.

06:34.435 --> 06:36.353
Have you seen little Elsie?

06:36.604 --> 06:39.606
No. Didn't she just
come up the stairs?

06:39.982 --> 06:42.818
No, she's not home yet.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.695
She won't be long now.
Good-bye.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.490
Good-bye, Mr. Gehrke.

<i>Extra! Extra!</i>

08:34.722 --> 08:37.515
Extra! Extra!

08:54.992 --> 08:58.453
No, I can't give change!
Extra!

08:58.788 --> 09:01.873
Makes you afraid
to send your kids to school!

09:04.627 --> 09:07.337
Who is the murderer?

09:11.676 --> 09:15.262
"Because the police
did not publish my first letter,

09:16.389 --> 09:19.766
I am writing now

Proceed with your investigations.

09:24.063 --> 09:27.148
All will soon be confirmed.

09:33.447 --> 09:35.991

09:36.158 --> 09:38.535
<i>10,000 marks' reward.</i>

09:38.786 --> 09:41.538
<i>- Christ, here we go again!
- This is horrible!</i>

09:44.458 --> 09:46.585
<i>The print's too small.
We can't read it.</i>

09:46.711 --> 09:49.212
<i>You in front, read it out loud!</i>

09:51.048 --> 09:53.174
<i>- Let him read!
- Hey! Quiet!</i>

09:53.384 --> 09:56.553
"The terror in our town
has found a new victim".

09:56.804 --> 09:59.431
<i>Louder!
We can't hear a word!</i>

09:59.682 --> 10:03.101
<i>"Certain evidence leads us to believe</i>

10:03.352 --> 10:05.854
<i>that this is the same murderer</i>

10:06.272 --> 10:09.441
<i>who has already claimed eight victims
from among our city's children.</i>

10:09.817 --> 10:12.611
<i>We must emphasize once again</i>

10:12.820 --> 10:16.031
that it is, now more than ever,
every mother and father's sacred duty

10:16.324 --> 10:20.535
to alert their children
to this ever present danger

10:20.661 --> 10:26.541
and to the friendly guise
it is likely to assume.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.003
A little candy, a toy, or an apple

10:30.421 --> 10:34.549
can suffice to lure a child
to his or her doom".

10:35.009 --> 10:36.885
Very true!

10:38.262 --> 10:40.096
Keep reading.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.434
"Anxiety among the general public
is heightened

10:44.685 --> 10:50.440
by the police's failure
to apprehend a suspect.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.402
But the police are faced
with the almost impossible task

10:54.570 --> 10:59.074
of catching a criminal who left
not the slightest clue behind.

10:59.742 --> 11:01.576
Who is the murderer?'

11:01.702 --> 11:03.244
What does he look like?

11:04.372 --> 11:05.747
Where is he hiding?

11:05.956 --> 11:09.334
No one knows him,
yet he is among us.

11:09.585 --> 11:12.921
Anybody sitting next to you
could be the murderer".

11:15.925 --> 11:18.426
Yes, that's very true.

11:18.552 --> 11:22.097
- Why look at me when you say that?
- You know very well.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.641
What do I know very well?

11:25.768 --> 11:28.603
Think about it.
It'll come to you.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.439
What are you saying?

11:31.607 --> 11:36.820
I saw you follow that little girl
from the fourth floor up the stairs.

11:36.987 --> 11:39.155
You're crazy, you dirty swine!

11:39.407 --> 11:42.450
Who's the swine?
Me, or a man who chases little girls?

11:42.618 --> 11:45.787
You bastard! You swine!

11:45.996 --> 11:47.664
Murderer!

11:48.290 --> 11:49.833
Gentlemen!

11:51.001 --> 11:54.295
I'll see you in court!

11:54.630 --> 11:56.965
I'll have you locked up!

11:59.468 --> 12:02.971
Slanderer!
Trying to ruin my reputation!

12:03.139 --> 12:06.349
<i>Damn slanderer!
Besmirching a man's good name!</i>

12:06.517 --> 12:08.601
<i>And the police fall for it!</i>

12:09.311 --> 12:10.478
<i>A search warrant!</i>

12:10.730 --> 12:13.106
How awful! What a disgrace!

12:13.274 --> 12:15.442
Searching a man's house
based on an anonymous letter!

12:15.609 --> 12:20.488
Mr. Jäger, please calm down.
We're only doing our job.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.659
As if it weren't enough
that we're in constant fear for our kids!

12:24.869 --> 12:28.997
You see? That's why the police
must follow up every lead.

12:29.457 --> 12:32.208
Any man on the street
could be the murderer.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.838
Can you please tell me
what time it is?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.506
Yes, my child.

12:45.055 --> 12:49.184
Now you must hurry home.
Where do you live?

12:49.727 --> 12:52.228
What's it to you
where the kid lives?

12:54.857 --> 12:55.815
Excuse me?

12:55.941 --> 12:57.692
What do you want with that kid?

12:58.819 --> 13:01.362
Absolutely nothing!

13:01.572 --> 13:03.782
What do you want with me?

13:04.033 --> 13:05.658
I'll show you what I want!

13:05.868 --> 13:09.370
Let me go!
This is an outrage!

13:09.622 --> 13:11.539
- What's going on?
- This is an outrage!

13:11.749 --> 13:14.459
- What does Four-Eyes want?
- Don't get so excited.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.670
First chatting up children...
- Punch him in the face!

13:17.880 --> 13:19.297
then acting like a big shot!

13:19.423 --> 13:23.384
Will you let me go!
I didn't even speak to the child!

13:23.552 --> 13:26.429
- Get her alone, eh?
- And kill her like the others, right?

13:26.680 --> 13:29.682
- He's the murderer!
- Hold him!

13:29.892 --> 13:31.142
Call the police!

13:31.393 --> 13:35.480
- Never around when you need 'em!
- Officer!

13:38.192 --> 13:41.611
Make way, gentlemen.
Let us through.

13:41.862 --> 13:46.407
Sure, you can catch pickpockets!
Why don't you catch the murderer instead!

13:46.534 --> 13:48.701
What? Is he the murderer?

13:50.454 --> 13:51.955
Break it up!
Come on, move along!

13:52.206 --> 13:54.374
- The murderer!
- The monster!

13:55.709 --> 13:57.252
Get him!

13:58.921 --> 14:00.922
Tackle him!

14:05.970 --> 14:08.179
MURDERER WRITES TO THE PRESS

14:08.931 --> 14:12.684
"Because the police

14:21.652 --> 14:23.653

14:26.615 --> 14:28.992
This is a terrible scandal!

14:29.243 --> 14:33.872
Imagine the effect such a note
will have on the public, Commissioner!

14:34.123 --> 14:37.292
This is simply irresponsible!

14:38.377 --> 14:42.463
Mr. Secretary, we cannot stop the murderer
from writing to whomever he wishes!

14:43.549 --> 14:47.802
This severely pathological man
probably takes great pleasure

14:47.970 --> 14:51.347
in seeing his crimes
covered in the press.

14:52.391 --> 14:55.101
We immediately got in touch
with the newspaper

14:55.227 --> 14:57.604
and had them send us
the original letter.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.981
The lab's working on it right now.

15:00.232 --> 15:05.737
<i>Of course, you can't get good
fingerprints from a postcard</i>

15:05.863 --> 15:08.573
<i>that's passed
through so many hands.</i>

15:08.824 --> 15:11.367
<i>Nevertheless,
we will leave no stone unturned.</i>

15:11.493 --> 15:14.621
<i>We'll painstakingly compare
the results against our archives</i>

15:14.747 --> 15:19.918
<i>in hopes of finding something
that can be used to solve this case.</i>

15:20.169 --> 15:22.670
<i>Then we'll send the letter
to our graphologist.</i>

15:23.839 --> 15:28.551
"The aforementioned diamond-shaped
and swelling sweeps,

15:29.261 --> 15:35.308
clearly seen in the word 'soon',
third line from the bottom..."

15:35.434 --> 15:37.393
You got that?
- Yes.

15:37.728 --> 15:44.025
"...attest to the strongly pathological
sexuality of this sex offender.

15:44.193 --> 15:45.526
Period.

15:46.695 --> 15:52.700
The partially disrupted and uneven style
of his other letters

15:53.202 --> 15:56.120
is, in its interpretation,

15:56.872 --> 15:59.707
<i>a form of acting</i>

15:59.959 --> 16:06.381
<i>which may manifest externally
as indolence or even lethargy.</i>

16:08.717 --> 16:11.427
<i>The writing as a whole displays</i>

16:11.762 --> 16:17.558
<i>elusive yet unmistakable signs</i>

16:17.977 --> 16:20.728
<i>of madness".</i>

16:22.731 --> 16:25.733
Yes, of course, Commissioner.

16:25.985 --> 16:30.238
I have no doubt you're doing your job,
and your men as well.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.740
But we need results!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.575
Results!

16:37.913 --> 16:41.958
Mr. Secretary, my men haven't gotten
12 hours' sleep in an entire week!

16:42.501 --> 16:46.295
<i>My riot squads
don't get a moment's peace.</i>

16:46.505 --> 16:51.634
<i>They report for duty almost more fatigued
than when they were dismissed,</i>

16:52.136 --> 16:56.431
<i>because the painstaking nature
of their work wears on the nerves,</i>

16:56.640 --> 17:01.352
<i>and 80% - if not 90% -
of our leads are false.</i>

17:01.687 --> 17:04.771
<i>The homicide squad doesn't even
get time to change clothes.</i>

17:05.023 --> 17:09.277
<i>They're constantly on call,
always tense and alert,</i>

17:09.611 --> 17:11.904
<i>ever ready to spring into action,</i>

17:12.031 --> 17:14.906
<i>to follow even the slightest lead,</i>

17:15.117 --> 17:17.785
<i>as it just might be
the one that solves the case.</i>

17:18.078 --> 17:21.622
<i>Mr. Secretary, just consider
the search of the crime scene.</i>

17:23.125 --> 17:25.251
<i>To give you an example:</i>

17:25.419 --> 17:30.214
<i>In the bushes
just behind a picket fence,</i>

17:30.674 --> 17:36.679
<i>a small, white, crumpled
paper wrapping was found.</i>

17:37.806 --> 17:40.475
<i>It apparently once contained
inexpensive sweets.</i>

17:41.351 --> 17:43.519
<i>In the outermost corner</i>

17:43.645 --> 17:46.647
<i>were found traces of fruit drops</i>

17:46.899 --> 17:49.984
<i>and particles of powdered sugar.</i>

17:51.111 --> 17:53.321
<i>We've tried to trace the origin
of this wrapper</i>

17:53.447 --> 17:58.951
<i>in every candy shop and grocery store
within a radius of a mile and a half,</i>

17:59.787 --> 18:01.454
<i>but all to no avail.</i>

18:02.581 --> 18:05.666
<i>With each passing day
we expand the area searched.</i>

18:09.004 --> 18:12.924
<i>But, of course,
after such a long time,</i>

18:13.050 --> 18:17.178
<i>no one remembers anything
that could serve as a lead.</i>

18:18.347 --> 18:21.516
<i>Despite all these setbacks,</i>

18:21.850 --> 18:26.229
<i>we're forced to press on
in our investigation,</i>

18:26.355 --> 18:27.980
<i>always in uncertainty,</i>

18:28.107 --> 18:31.192
<i>and with little chance of success</i>

18:31.401 --> 18:35.279
<i>in bringing the case
even one step closer to its conclusion.</i>

18:35.405 --> 18:36.697
<i>Our men are doing everyth...</i>

18:36.865 --> 18:39.242
What good is all this?

18:39.493 --> 18:42.578
Commissioner,
I'm aware you're not dawdling,

18:42.704 --> 18:46.582
but that doesn't change the fact
that an unknown killer

18:46.834 --> 18:50.545
is terrorizing 4 1/2 million people!

18:50.671 --> 18:52.630
And the police are getting nowhere!

18:54.967 --> 18:58.261
Mr. Secretary, you don't seem
to have a clear picture

18:58.387 --> 19:03.057
of the enormous obstacles
confronting our forces.

19:03.725 --> 19:05.393
Do you realize, for example,

19:05.561 --> 19:09.939
regarding the route
the child took home,

19:10.315 --> 19:15.486
that there are 15 conflicting
eyewitness accounts alone?

19:15.654 --> 19:18.197
Let me give you a random example:

19:18.448 --> 19:22.326
"Testimony 1,478
in the Beckmann murder case..."

19:22.452 --> 19:24.495
- You've got no clue.
- More than you, mister!

19:24.621 --> 19:27.206
Gentlemen!

19:27.332 --> 19:31.377
You must at least know the color
of the cap the little girl wore

19:31.503 --> 19:34.255
whom you say you saw
with the stranger!

19:34.381 --> 19:36.257
Of course, Inspector.
It was red!

19:36.425 --> 19:39.385
- It was green!
- Red!

19:43.432 --> 19:46.434
Stop! This is pointless!

19:46.810 --> 19:49.854
Thank you, gentlemen.
- You're welcome!

19:50.439 --> 19:51.939
Next witness.

19:52.274 --> 19:55.651
If you rely
on a color-blind man for clues,

19:55.777 --> 19:58.154
don't be surprised
if you get nowhere!

19:58.280 --> 20:01.115
In their hunt
for this unknown killer,

20:01.366 --> 20:05.786
the police have tracked down
more than 1,500 detailed leads.

20:06.205 --> 20:10.082
The files in this case
fill 60 thick volumes.

20:10.417 --> 20:12.126
We've dispatched all our forces

20:12.294 --> 20:14.921
<i>to systematically comb
the area adjoining the city.</i>

20:15.464 --> 20:18.633
<i>Every piece of undergrowth is scoured,
every thicket searched,</i>

20:18.800 --> 20:20.551
<i>every bush examined,</i>

20:20.677 --> 20:23.971
<i>since any bush or hollow
could harbor some object</i>

20:24.097 --> 20:26.432
<i>that could finally set us
on the right track.</i>

20:27.392 --> 20:29.227
<i>We called in police dogs.</i>

20:29.353 --> 20:32.104
<i>We set the best trackers
on the faintest of traces,</i>

20:32.231 --> 20:33.773
<i>but they lost the scent</i>

20:33.899 --> 20:36.150
<i>and failed to pick it up again
despite all efforts.</i>

20:36.818 --> 20:38.236
<i>Since the first murders,</i>

20:38.362 --> 20:42.031
<i>the police have searched
homeless shelters night after night,</i>

20:42.282 --> 20:44.992
<i>subjecting everyone in them
to thorough scrutiny.</i>

20:45.535 --> 20:48.746
<i>This does not, of course,
make the police very popular,</i>

20:48.872 --> 20:51.165
<i>nor does it reduce
the general public's anxiety.</i>

20:51.625 --> 20:56.295
<i>Railway stations are kept
under surveillance around the clock.</i>

20:56.505 --> 21:00.508
<i>Still, the investigation has not yet
yielded the slightest results,</i>

21:00.676 --> 21:04.720
<i>nor have nightly raids
in the criminal districts.</i>

22:36.605 --> 22:38.105
The cops!

22:53.580 --> 22:54.622
<i>Get back!</i>

22:55.582 --> 22:57.750
<i>Back!
- This is the police!</i>

23:06.385 --> 23:08.677
<i>Let me go, you dirty bastard!</i>

23:09.012 --> 23:11.722
<i>Let me go, you son of a bitch!</i>

23:12.140 --> 23:15.309
Goddamn bastard!

23:16.770 --> 23:18.854
Put me down!

23:19.189 --> 23:20.981
Let me go!

23:21.149 --> 23:22.983
Let her go, you filthy pig!

23:26.071 --> 23:27.905
Quiet!

23:28.031 --> 23:29.281
Move back!

23:29.408 --> 23:31.409
The top fuzz!

23:32.577 --> 23:34.412
Quiet!

23:34.538 --> 23:36.497
Police orders:

23:36.623 --> 23:39.834
Nobody is to leave this establishment.
Get your papers ready.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.011
Please!

23:54.683 --> 23:57.643
Come now, children,
stop this foolishness.

23:58.311 --> 24:00.688
Well, if it isn't Tubby Lohmann!

24:12.284 --> 24:14.660
Quiet!

24:16.246 --> 24:17.746
That'll get you nowhere.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.708
- Go after the murderer instead!
- Right!

24:25.005 --> 24:26.046
Quiet!

24:27.048 --> 24:30.551
Be reasonable now!
Step back!

24:31.303 --> 24:33.220
You hear me? Step back!

24:33.388 --> 24:36.891
Let's go!
Come on, let's see those papers!

24:37.058 --> 24:39.977
<i>- I haven't got any.
- Let's see your papers.</i>

24:40.187 --> 24:42.396
<i>Please let me go, Inspector!</i>

24:42.647 --> 24:45.566
<i>The two guys who tried to escape
were caught on the Krangasse.</i>

24:45.817 --> 24:47.902
<i>- Leave those chairs alone!
- Shut up!</i>

24:48.069 --> 24:49.445
<i>Have your papers ready!</i>

24:49.613 --> 24:51.113
<i>Haven't we met before?
- Yeah. So?</i>

24:52.199 --> 24:53.824
<i>Off to the precinct again!</i>

24:54.075 --> 24:56.202
<i>Haven't even made a buck tonight!</i>

24:58.955 --> 25:01.916
<i>Anyone without papers
goes down to the precinct!</i>

25:02.083 --> 25:06.086
<i>I tell you, I'm innocent, really!</i>

25:06.213 --> 25:07.463
<i>Stop talking nonsense!</i>

25:07.714 --> 25:09.423
<i>- Let's get moving!
- Kiss my ass!</i>

25:09.549 --> 25:12.676
<i>- Show your papers!
- Where's the paddy wagon?</i>

25:12.802 --> 25:14.470
<i>Don't push.</i>

25:14.763 --> 25:16.597
<i>Everyone will get their turn.</i>

25:16.765 --> 25:18.974
<i>- Silence!
- Cool it, kids!</i>

25:19.100 --> 25:20.392
<i>Have your papers ready!</i>

25:21.603 --> 25:22.645
Your papers.

25:22.771 --> 25:25.856
Inspector, I can't carry my birth
certificate around with me everywhere!

25:25.982 --> 25:28.609
- Quit your bellyaching, child.
- I really can't, Inspector!

25:28.735 --> 25:30.236
The precinct for you!

25:30.487 --> 25:32.112
You make me puke!

26:20.829 --> 26:23.664
Shoddy work, my friend.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.333
You've been had.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.503
Precinct.
- See you, Willy. Ta-ta!

26:29.713 --> 26:32.089
Ah, lay off!

26:32.215 --> 26:33.382
Next.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.344
Stuck-up snob.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.030
What's wrong?

26:56.239 --> 26:59.199
- Papa Lohmann...
- ...nabbed him!

27:02.871 --> 27:05.706
UNSOLVED BURGLARY AT FURRIER'S

27:09.044 --> 27:11.253
We'd better take you
down to the precinct too.

27:11.379 --> 27:15.215
What do you mean?
My papers are in order.

27:15.342 --> 27:16.425
Move on.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.676
Move on!

27:17.802 --> 27:19.011
Ah, tough luck!

27:19.137 --> 27:20.512
Next.

27:23.683 --> 27:25.934
Papers.
- Don't got none.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.394
To the precinct.

27:27.562 --> 27:29.271
Just my luck.

27:29.522 --> 27:31.273
Next, come on.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.141
You're ruining my business, Sarge.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.226
These raids every night.

28:49.686 --> 28:52.813
No one can get a moment's peace!
They're human beings too.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.773
You think...

28:55.150 --> 28:59.153
we stay up all night
just for the hell of it?

28:59.320 --> 29:00.404
No.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.322
But you're drivin' away my clientele,

29:02.490 --> 29:05.242
and you won't find the guy
you're lookin' for here anyway.

29:06.661 --> 29:10.330
If you knew how steamed they are

29:10.582 --> 29:12.583
at the guy who's causing these raids.

29:12.876 --> 29:14.543
Especially the girls.

29:14.669 --> 29:17.379
Sure, they solicit.
Business is business.

29:17.922 --> 29:20.716
But believe me,

29:21.050 --> 29:24.136
in every one of them
beats a mother's heart!

29:24.345 --> 29:26.513
I know a lot of toughs

29:26.681 --> 29:30.476
who get all teary-eyed
just seein' the little ones at play.

29:30.935 --> 29:35.022
If they ever get their hands
on that monster,

29:35.148 --> 29:37.024
they'll make toothpicks out of him!

29:37.567 --> 29:39.485
Ready to leave, Sergeant.

29:39.611 --> 29:40.986
So long.

29:51.498 --> 29:53.999
They hit the Crocodile Club today.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.877
Two paddy wagons.

30:02.717 --> 30:05.052
What's keeping Safecracker?

30:07.430 --> 30:10.224
Is it 3:00 yet?

30:10.391 --> 30:12.100
I'll find out.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.733
The exact time, please, miss.

30:20.777 --> 30:23.278
2:58. Thank you.

30:41.214 --> 30:44.758
2:58.

31:13.246 --> 31:16.498
The cops are crawling
the streets like ants again.

31:18.293 --> 31:20.043
Green coats wherever you spit.

31:20.169 --> 31:22.671
They're on your back
even if you're with a broad.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.716
They've gone nuts...
got this murderer on the brain.

31:26.259 --> 31:30.178
My old lady has a little six-year-old girl,
and every night I have to check

31:30.305 --> 31:34.099
under the bed to see
if the murderer's hiding there.

31:34.642 --> 31:38.061
You can't do business anymore
for tripping over cops everywhere.

31:38.271 --> 31:42.149
There's no privacy anymore.
I'm fed up with it.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.943
What else is new?

31:50.783 --> 31:54.119
- Where the heck is Safecracker?
- Think they might have nabbed him?

31:54.579 --> 31:56.830
That guy? Come on.

31:56.998 --> 32:02.169
Scotland Yard laid a trap for him once
on a bank job he pulled in London.

32:02.337 --> 32:05.839
There he was, hands up,
back to the wall,

32:06.132 --> 32:09.259
cops all around him.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.346
Seconds later there were
three men dead on the ground,

32:12.513 --> 32:14.431
but he wasn't one of 'em!

32:14.557 --> 32:17.142
No one better
from Berlin to San Francisco.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.812
They've been after him six years
and they've yet to get him.

32:20.939 --> 32:23.565
Not yet. But put enough dogs
on the fox's tail...

32:23.816 --> 32:25.525
Can it!

32:34.118 --> 32:35.285
Damn it!

32:37.246 --> 32:38.956
I can't take this!

32:40.124 --> 32:42.292
He was always right on time before.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.381
- Thank God!
- Finally.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.134
Morning!

32:51.260 --> 32:53.595
Are you nuts?
Close those blinds!

33:16.661 --> 33:19.454
Gentlemen,
I hereby open this meeting.

33:19.580 --> 33:23.917
I declare all division leaders
of this organization present.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.920
I assume you're authorized
to make binding decisions

33:27.046 --> 33:29.756
for your divisions.

33:31.259 --> 33:33.760
Good. We'll dispense
with the preliminaries,

33:33.886 --> 33:36.304
as we all know why we're here.

33:37.390 --> 33:41.435
An outsider is ruining
our business and our reputation.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.146
Measures taken by the police

33:44.272 --> 33:48.734
and the daily raids
to catch this child murderer

33:49.110 --> 33:52.571
are hampering our activities
to an almost unbearable degree.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.449
We can no longer tolerate the fact

33:55.616 --> 34:00.662
that we're not safe now in any hotel,
bar, café or even private home

34:00.788 --> 34:03.290
from the clutches of the police.

34:03.416 --> 34:04.499
Very true.

34:04.625 --> 34:06.752
This state of affairs must end.

34:06.878 --> 34:10.547
Things must return to normal
or we'll go under.

34:11.716 --> 34:14.301
Our coffers will soon be depleted.

34:14.802 --> 34:17.888
If we can't get funds to support
the wives of those members

34:18.723 --> 34:21.641
who currently enjoy
room and board at state expense,

34:22.101 --> 34:27.438
I don't know where we'll find
the money to carry out our plans.

34:27.607 --> 34:29.649
Our reputation is suffering as well.

34:29.817 --> 34:32.652
The police seek
the murderer in our fold.

34:33.987 --> 34:37.032
Gentlemen, when I run head-on
into an officer from the squad,

34:37.158 --> 34:39.701
he knows the potential risks,
and so do I.

34:39.994 --> 34:43.163
If either dies in the line of duty, fine.
Occupational hazard.

34:43.581 --> 34:47.167
But we must draw a firm line
between ourselves

34:47.293 --> 34:50.045
and this man they're looking for!

34:50.170 --> 34:52.339
We conduct our business
in order to survive,

34:52.465 --> 34:54.800
but this monster
has no right to survive!

34:54.926 --> 34:57.052
He must be killed,
eliminated, exterminated!

34:57.178 --> 34:59.471
Without mercy or compassion!

35:03.351 --> 35:05.143
Gentlemen,

35:05.853 --> 35:08.855
our members must be able
to go about their business again

35:09.440 --> 35:14.486
without frantic cops
in their way at every turn.

35:14.862 --> 35:15.987
I invite...

35:17.573 --> 35:20.700
...your views, gentlemen.

35:23.037 --> 35:26.915
Step up ID checks,
comb the entire city,

35:27.041 --> 35:31.545
and raids...
relentless, ever tougher raids!

35:32.338 --> 35:34.714
We need informers!

35:34.882 --> 35:38.051
We must know the police's plans
almost before they do themselves!

35:38.177 --> 35:40.178
The girls gotta work the cops more!

35:40.555 --> 35:44.766
How often has one of us been nabbed
'cause his gal ratted on him to the cops?

35:45.226 --> 35:46.852
Now they can rat on the cops!

35:46.978 --> 35:51.148
Every resident, every landlord,

35:51.566 --> 35:55.152
every property owner

35:55.444 --> 36:01.074
must be forced to consent
to meticulous searches of his property

36:01.284 --> 36:04.578
for the slightest of clues.

36:05.580 --> 36:08.957
What if we...
We have our connections.

36:10.126 --> 36:14.462
What if we put
an article in the papers

36:15.089 --> 36:19.426
that our syndicates...
I mean, our organization...

36:19.927 --> 36:23.555
doesn't wish to be lumped in
together with this pig,

36:23.681 --> 36:26.600
and that the cops should look
for this guy somewhere else.

36:26.767 --> 36:28.310
He's not even a real crook!

36:28.603 --> 36:31.062
This man may well be...

36:31.772 --> 36:35.567
when not engaged
in the actual act of killing...

36:36.611 --> 36:40.530
a harmless, upstanding citizen

36:40.656 --> 36:42.157
who wouldn't hurt a fly.

36:42.283 --> 36:45.952
In his right mind, perhaps he plays
marbles with his landlady's kids

36:46.078 --> 36:48.288
or plays cards with friends.

36:48.414 --> 36:52.167
Without what I'll call

36:52.335 --> 36:55.170
the innocuousness
of these murderers' private lives,

36:55.296 --> 36:59.799
it's inconceivable that someone
like Grossmann or Haarmann

36:59.926 --> 37:04.137
could have lived right next door
to their neighbors for years

37:04.472 --> 37:08.141
without arousing
the faintest trace of suspicion!

37:08.309 --> 37:11.311
This is where we must focus
the public's attention.

37:11.437 --> 37:13.647
The public must cooperate.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.192
I'll tell you about public cooperation!

37:17.610 --> 37:20.445
Just thinking of it makes me puke.

37:21.697 --> 37:23.448
I beg your pardon, Commissioner.

37:23.574 --> 37:26.910
But ain't it the truth?

37:27.870 --> 37:31.331
What the devil has public cooperation
gotten us so far?

37:33.751 --> 37:36.503
Piles of letters
full of the most outrageous slander!

37:36.629 --> 37:38.004
Very true.

37:38.172 --> 37:41.258
They alert homicide
whenever a chimney sweep walks by.

37:41.384 --> 37:42.717
That's right.

37:42.843 --> 37:45.804
But when you really want
reliable information from them,

37:46.639 --> 37:48.556
then they suddenly haven't got a clue.

37:48.933 --> 37:52.394
Why, they just can't seem
to remember a thing.

37:53.896 --> 37:56.856
There's your public cooperation
for you!

37:57.942 --> 38:00.860
I believe you're exaggerating a bit,
Lohmann.

38:01.862 --> 38:04.322
It can't really be that bad, can it?

38:04.824 --> 38:07.367
But it is, Commissioner!

38:07.868 --> 38:11.705
Most of the public
still takes the position,

38:11.914 --> 38:13.915
"How does this concern me?"

38:14.750 --> 38:18.795
The idea that
each individual is responsible

38:18.921 --> 38:22.882
for what happens to the poorest,
most anonymous child on the street

38:23.050 --> 38:26.845
hasn't even dawned
on the public at large!

38:30.224 --> 38:31.850
I've got another idea.

38:31.976 --> 38:33.893
There was this magician.

38:34.020 --> 38:37.564
Te... Tele...
I can't remember what you call it.

38:37.857 --> 38:40.942
Anyway, he could conjure up
hidden pennies out of handkerchiefs.

38:41.068 --> 38:44.112
The reward is still
far too little money.

38:45.906 --> 38:50.744
The man who leads us
to the murderer should get a fortune.

38:50.911 --> 38:53.288
None of this is anything new.

38:53.414 --> 38:55.206
This is all leading nowhere.

38:55.708 --> 38:59.586
So we just wait for the police
to catch the guy instead?

39:02.590 --> 39:06.426
The difficulties
in solving crimes of this nature

39:06.552 --> 39:09.888
are, in my experience,
often insurmountable,

39:10.431 --> 39:12.724
since perpetrator and victim

39:12.850 --> 39:16.519
are often brought together
by mere chance.

39:16.812 --> 39:20.357
The instincts of the moment
drive the murderer's actions.

39:20.608 --> 39:24.235
The victim is found and identified,

39:24.612 --> 39:26.780
his or her last known whereabouts
are determined,

39:26.947 --> 39:28.656
and then...

39:29.909 --> 39:33.119
then comes the big question mark.

39:34.789 --> 39:37.540
These children vanish
without a trace.

39:40.252 --> 39:42.712
And when they're found...

39:46.425 --> 39:51.179
Well, we all know the state
in which we've found them.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.850
And the perpetrator...

39:58.145 --> 40:00.105
It's a fact well-known to all of us

40:00.231 --> 40:04.234
that murderers like this
rarely leave a clue behind.

40:04.693 --> 40:08.655
That's what makes our work so hard,
our successes so few.

40:08.781 --> 40:12.367
The police have been after
this murderer for eight months now.

40:13.953 --> 40:17.205
They'll only get him by accident now.
- We can't wait for that.

40:17.373 --> 40:19.833
No, we'll go broke by then.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.126
What, then?

40:38.561 --> 40:40.437
We have to catch him...

40:41.647 --> 40:43.189
ourselves.

40:47.903 --> 40:50.405
Yes, that's what we must do.

40:51.740 --> 40:56.119
There is perhaps one other way.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.747
I'm quite certain that information
on the individual in question

40:59.874 --> 41:05.378
must already exist somewhere.

41:05.588 --> 41:09.549
Being the severely pathological case
that he is,

41:09.717 --> 41:14.220
he has no doubt already had some kind
of contact with the authorities.

41:15.431 --> 41:18.808
That's why all health care facilities,

41:19.143 --> 41:22.729
prisons, clinics and insane asylums

41:23.063 --> 41:26.816
must be encouraged
to cooperate with us unequivocally.

41:27.526 --> 41:30.570
We specifically need information

41:30.738 --> 41:35.158
on those released after being deemed
harmless to society

41:35.493 --> 41:38.828
but who, due to their inclinations,

41:39.246 --> 41:41.915
could be the murderer.

41:42.082 --> 41:45.293
We must cover the city
with a net of informers.

41:46.754 --> 41:50.423
Every square mile must be
under constant surveillance.

41:50.674 --> 41:54.177
No child in this city must take
a single step without us knowing it.

41:54.303 --> 41:56.679
- Fine, but how?
- And who?

41:56.805 --> 42:00.517
It must be people who can go
anywhere without causing a stir,

42:00.643 --> 42:03.770
follow anyone
without attracting attention,

42:03.938 --> 42:07.941
follow any child to any house
without arousing suspicion.

42:08.275 --> 42:12.445
In short, people whom the killer
would never suspect.

42:12.571 --> 42:14.781
- But who?
- There are no such people!

42:14.949 --> 42:16.950
- Who could do that?
- Who?

42:21.247 --> 42:22.497
The beggars.

42:22.998 --> 42:25.250
The organization of beggars!

42:55.447 --> 42:57.949
MR. CREDIT IS DEAD AND BURIED -
THE MANAGEMENT

43:04.498 --> 43:06.457
Blood pudding's on the upswing.

43:09.003 --> 43:11.504
God, this cheese stinks so good.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.179
Take that, you sons of bitches!

43:29.982 --> 43:33.276
Hey, stop snoring.
You'll wake up the lice.

43:42.870 --> 43:44.370
Two, four, six...

43:46.457 --> 43:48.833
NO BEGGARS OR PEDDLERS

43:52.046 --> 43:54.922
SANDWICHES

44:03.557 --> 44:05.933
Bread-and-butter sandwich,
lukewarm response.

44:08.437 --> 44:11.606
Black Friday for roast beef.

44:31.627 --> 44:34.128
All right.
Now come the courtyards.

44:34.922 --> 44:39.092
Yes, from number 1 to 88.

44:42.471 --> 44:44.013
Next.

44:49.269 --> 44:52.897
You're responsible for the courtyards
on Hauptstrasse from 1 to 88.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.565
Got it.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.109
What's next?

44:56.235 --> 44:59.612
Hauptstrasse, from number 89...

45:00.906 --> 45:02.198
to 196.

45:02.324 --> 45:04.409
Hauptstrasse,

45:04.743 --> 45:08.955
number 89 to 196.

45:09.581 --> 45:13.793
Member number?
- 3795. Emil Dustermann.

45:30.144 --> 45:32.770
Well, Emil, maybe
you'll win the 15,000.

45:32.896 --> 45:35.314
I've got my fingers crossed.

45:35.774 --> 45:37.150
Knock on wood.

46:19.193 --> 46:21.736
My heartfelt thanks,
ladies and gentlemen.

46:24.156 --> 46:26.157
Thank you.

47:18.085 --> 47:21.128
"In searching homes,
be on the lookout for any clue

47:21.630 --> 47:25.091
which could establish the origin
of the murderer's letter to the Courier.

47:25.551 --> 47:27.260
Be on the lookout as well

47:27.553 --> 47:30.555
for an old wooden table..."

47:31.723 --> 47:33.182
Idiot!

47:38.772 --> 47:40.439
"...or red pencil..."

47:41.483 --> 47:42.859
Come in.

47:43.902 --> 47:47.613
"... or writing paper
of the type used by the killer".

47:48.615 --> 47:53.452
Inspector, here are reports on mental
patients who've been released as cured

47:53.620 --> 47:56.497
or deemed harmless
over the last five years.

47:56.623 --> 47:58.833
Reports from every
private and public institute,

47:58.959 --> 48:02.169
as well as from
municipal hospitals and asylums.

48:14.433 --> 48:18.603
And here's a list
of their present addresses.

48:54.514 --> 48:57.516
Good day.
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

48:57.643 --> 48:58.851
Pardon me?

48:59.061 --> 49:01.562
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

49:01.772 --> 49:04.857
I'm afraid I don't understand.
I'm a bit hard of hearing.

49:05.025 --> 49:06.734
You don't say.

49:07.069 --> 49:09.654
Does a Mr. Beckert live here?

49:09.947 --> 49:14.450
Mr. Beckert... yes, he does.
But he just stepped out.

49:14.701 --> 49:17.828
I had hoped to speak with him.

49:18.622 --> 49:20.998
I'm from the tax office.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.501
The tax office. Oh, my Lord!

49:23.710 --> 49:26.337
Perhaps you'd like to wait for him...

49:26.463 --> 49:28.214
Yes, thank you.

49:36.056 --> 49:39.308
- Please have a seat.
- Thank you.

49:52.239 --> 49:55.783
- Perhaps you'd like something to read.
- Thank you. Most kind.

49:55.909 --> 49:58.786
THE GENERAL GAZETTE

49:59.162 --> 50:00.621
Tell me, Mrs. Winkler,

50:01.123 --> 50:03.541
does Mr. Beckert
subscribe to any newspapers?

50:03.917 --> 50:07.420
Mr. Beckert?
No, he always borrows mine.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.131
I see. Thank you.

53:23.325 --> 53:26.827
Mommy!
I wanted to meet you halfway!

53:27.078 --> 53:29.622
Child, you mustn't do that.

53:29.998 --> 53:31.540
You know why.

54:16.294 --> 54:18.170
Good day.
What would you like?

54:18.380 --> 54:19.880
Coffee.

54:20.548 --> 54:23.717
No, a vermouth.
No, a cognac.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.036
Here you are.

54:56.835 --> 54:58.252
Another.

55:32.329 --> 55:33.912
Check.

55:34.247 --> 55:37.041
Two cognacs...
that's 1.65, please.

55:39.961 --> 55:41.420
Thank you very much.

55:47.594 --> 55:51.347
Number 24: Beckert.
Doesn't take the Courier.

55:51.473 --> 55:54.099
Table: polished mahogany,
with tablecloth.

55:54.267 --> 55:57.936
No traces of red pencil.
In fact, no writing materials of any kind.

55:58.271 --> 55:59.813
Printed matter found in wastebasket:

55:59.939 --> 56:01.982
cigar ad and a postcard

56:02.609 --> 56:04.318
with flowers
and "Regards, Paul" on it,

56:04.444 --> 56:06.278
but no address of sender.

56:06.404 --> 56:09.782
An empty cigarette pack, Ariston brand,
a bag of candy...

56:13.536 --> 56:15.371
Just a moment.

56:18.792 --> 56:20.793
Ariston?

56:32.013 --> 56:34.056
What was that?

56:43.900 --> 56:49.780
I'd like the file
on the Marga Perl murder case.

56:52.033 --> 56:53.826
Thank you very much.

57:01.793 --> 57:03.544
That's odd.

57:04.796 --> 57:07.464
I've heard that before.

57:10.510 --> 57:12.094
It was...

57:14.931 --> 57:16.557
It was...

57:36.536 --> 57:38.412
<i>Hey, Heinrich!</i>

57:43.918 --> 57:45.794
What is it?

57:47.464 --> 57:51.258
What's wrong?
- Listen. Someone's whistling.

57:52.552 --> 57:54.261
Can't you hear it?

57:54.554 --> 57:55.846
There.

57:58.433 --> 57:59.975
Now he's stopped.

58:01.561 --> 58:03.979
Did you see
the guy who was whistling?

58:04.105 --> 58:06.440
Yes, I can still see him.

58:06.566 --> 58:12.196
Heinrich, he's talking to a little girl
and walking her down the street.

58:12.405 --> 58:16.325
- After him, quick, and don't lose him!
- Why?

58:16.576 --> 58:20.829
The day little Elsie Beckmann
was killed,

58:20.955 --> 58:23.665
a man bought a balloon from me.

58:23.791 --> 58:26.835
He was with a little girl...

58:30.590 --> 58:35.761
and he whistled just like that!

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.143
Damn it, man!

01:00:06.352 --> 01:00:09.313
Are you crazy,
throwing orange peels on the ground?

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.690
A man could slip and break his neck!
Unbelievable!

01:00:11.816 --> 01:00:14.067
I should report you to the police!

01:00:14.319 --> 01:00:16.820
Outrageous behavior!

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.240
Hey, mister.

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:35.297
Aha! Here it is.

01:00:35.548 --> 01:00:41.428
"In a 150-foot radius
of the crime scene,

01:00:41.554 --> 01:00:44.806
three cigarette butts of the Ariston brand
were found". There you have it.

01:00:45.516 --> 01:00:48.477
Yes, it may be
the same brand of cigarettes,

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.064
but there was no old wooden table.

01:00:53.066 --> 01:00:58.570
Of course, he could have written
that letter somewhere else.

01:01:03.284 --> 01:01:04.993
Good God!

01:01:06.412 --> 01:01:07.871
<i>The window ledge!</i>

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:22.844
You're right.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:26.848
Just a minute.

01:01:34.399 --> 01:01:35.565
Red pencil.

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.529
My God, finally!

01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:44.408
We're finally on his trail.

01:01:47.161 --> 01:01:48.412
What?

01:01:49.205 --> 01:01:51.123
They're on his trail?

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:55.043
<i>- Did they find him?
- The beggars found him.</i>

01:01:55.294 --> 01:01:57.629
- His whistling gave him away.
- They put a mark on him.

01:01:57.755 --> 01:01:59.172
Shut up!

01:01:59.632 --> 01:02:01.258
What did you say?

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:05.470
They're following the mark.
He isn't out of sight for a second.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:09.641
<i>His every move is being watched.</i>

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:18.919
- Mister.
- What is it?

01:03:19.045 --> 01:03:21.880
- You got some white stuff on your coat.
- Where?

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.257
On your shoulder.

01:03:29.055 --> 01:03:31.264
Here, I'll wipe it off.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:40.857
- What's the matter?
- Come on. We're leaving.

01:05:12.950 --> 01:05:15.493
He didn't come out this way.
We would've seen him.

01:05:15.661 --> 01:05:16.786
Out of the question!

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:20.916
- Well, he didn't turn back.
- He has to be somewhere, damn it!

01:05:25.171 --> 01:05:28.340
Maybe he's hiding
inside the building.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.028
Closing time!

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:54.324
We can't let him get away in the crowd!
If he slips through now...

01:05:54.659 --> 01:05:56.034
They're starting to come out!

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:58.536
Out in the street,
and keep your eyes peeled!

01:06:07.254 --> 01:06:09.214
Excuse me, may I ask you a question?

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.051
My trip is tomorrow.
I start in Königsberg...

01:06:14.929 --> 01:06:17.764
No, in my condition
I can't eat anything like that...

01:06:18.015 --> 01:06:20.892
The boss came to my office today...

01:06:23.187 --> 01:06:25.021
Turn off the light.

01:06:25.147 --> 01:06:28.441
He'll get suspicious
if he comes home and sees it on.

01:06:33.155 --> 01:06:35.031
What time is it, anyway?

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.451
Almost 6:30.

01:06:56.262 --> 01:06:58.722
He's gotta still be inside!

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.100
He definitely didn't come out
with the office crowd.

01:07:09.942 --> 01:07:11.651
No, just a moment.

01:07:12.653 --> 01:07:15.488
The beggars have called for backup
and surrounded the whole building.

01:07:15.614 --> 01:07:18.408
They figure the guy's hiding
in the building.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.707
What sort of building is it?

01:07:27.334 --> 01:07:29.502
What sort of building is it?

01:07:29.628 --> 01:07:32.213
Nothing but offices.

01:07:33.591 --> 01:07:35.633
I don't know what's in the basement.

01:07:36.302 --> 01:07:39.262
There's a branch of the local
savings bank on the ground floor,

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:43.808
and the second to sixth floors
are nothing but offices.

01:07:43.934 --> 01:07:45.518
Above that is the attic space.

01:07:51.317 --> 01:07:53.151
This is unbelievable.

01:07:54.945 --> 01:07:56.613
Anyone still in there?

01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:06.164
Anyone still in here?

01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:26.768
What the devil!

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.187
Anybody still in here?

01:08:39.198 --> 01:08:41.407
Damn carelessness!

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.121
All that trouble for one door.

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:10.979
Seems the guy's cornered now.

01:09:11.229 --> 01:09:13.898
I think we should tip
the cops off right away.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:16.109
- I agree.
- Let's not waste time!

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:21.613
Stay by the phone
and call back in a few minutes.

01:09:21.866 --> 01:09:23.198
What is it?

01:09:23.367 --> 01:09:25.702
Are you crazy or something?
The police?

01:09:26.036 --> 01:09:28.705
No! We're gonna get
this guy ourselves!

01:09:28.913 --> 01:09:30.582
Listen, the time now is...

01:09:32.084 --> 01:09:32.959
8:00.

01:09:33.085 --> 01:09:37.380
All right. 9:00... 10:00...

01:09:37.631 --> 01:09:38.756
At 11:00!

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:06.576
Evening. Did you know
your gate isn't closed?

01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:09.329
What? That's impossible!

01:10:09.955 --> 01:10:12.999
Why I just... Wait, it is!

01:10:15.794 --> 01:10:18.463
Open up, quick!
And not a sound!

01:10:18.589 --> 01:10:20.798
Come on! Move it!

01:10:21.133 --> 01:10:23.218
Let's go!

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:25.261
Come on, move it!

01:10:53.165 --> 01:10:55.625
How many other watchmen
are in the building?

01:10:58.587 --> 01:11:00.713
Don't want to answer, eh?

01:11:02.341 --> 01:11:03.967
Very well.

01:11:37.668 --> 01:11:39.711
There are still two watchmen
on their rounds.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:05.236
Goddamn it!

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:08.197
Damn piece of crap!

01:12:14.997 --> 01:12:17.081
Goddamned lock!

01:12:30.929 --> 01:12:33.014
Damn it to hell!

01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:34.766
Shit!

01:13:29.988 --> 01:13:32.657
Careful where you shine those lights!

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:35.535
And don't stomp around
like elephants!

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.453
He's not in the basement.

01:13:37.579 --> 01:13:39.789
We went through it all
and found nothing.

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:43.334
Two men are still going
through the boiler room.

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:45.128
Hold it!

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.838
This is the last one.

01:13:47.089 --> 01:13:49.674
Go up and join Emil.
He needs help.

01:13:57.307 --> 01:13:58.850
Safecracker sent me.

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.184
All right.

01:14:01.061 --> 01:14:02.353
Listen carefully.

01:14:02.855 --> 01:14:07.150
This is a new type of time clock.

01:14:07.943 --> 01:14:10.194
Here's a general diagram.

01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.822
If they're not set
at exactly the right minute,

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:16.993
an alarm automatically goes off
at the nearest police station. Get it?

01:14:19.788 --> 01:14:21.330
You got it?

01:14:21.457 --> 01:14:24.208
- I'm not an idiot!
- Well...

01:14:26.003 --> 01:14:29.672
He's not in the boiler room
or the coal room.

01:14:29.798 --> 01:14:31.924
We turned over every piece of coal.

01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:36.345
Hey!

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:39.265
Are you nuts?

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:44.228
What if the doors are wired?
You want the police here in five minutes?

01:14:45.772 --> 01:14:49.442
We gotta get in if we're gonna
search the whole place!

01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:51.903
But not through the door, you idiot!

01:14:52.070 --> 01:14:54.280
Go through the ceiling
of the office above!

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:02.205
Nothing.

01:15:38.367 --> 01:15:40.409
All right. Down we go.

01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:33.004
Hey, what's up?

01:16:33.505 --> 01:16:35.006
Hey! What is it?

01:16:35.132 --> 01:16:37.383
Wait a minute!
Answer me, damn it!

01:16:37.509 --> 01:16:40.011
What's going on?
- I heard some banging!

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:44.557
- Where are you off to?
- Why are you running?

01:16:49.229 --> 01:16:51.147
<i>Wait, damn it!</i>

01:16:52.482 --> 01:16:54.358
I've gotta see Safecracker!

01:16:54.526 --> 01:16:58.779
He's in the attic, I tell you!
I heard him knocking!

01:17:15.797 --> 01:17:16.881
Quiet!

01:18:06.264 --> 01:18:08.766
Go on! He has to be in there!

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:11.602
Here's the light switch.

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:15.398
Force the locks.

01:18:15.857 --> 01:18:17.274
Come on. Hurry up!

01:18:28.954 --> 01:18:32.498
Got him! I found the guy!
He's in the attic!

01:18:32.624 --> 01:18:35.126
I heard someone banging,
and I told Safecracker.

01:18:35.293 --> 01:18:38.295
He's up there with eight men.
They'll get him any moment now.

01:18:38.422 --> 01:18:40.589
Just came down to fill you in.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:43.676
If I hadn't been alert,
we could've looked for him for hours!

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:44.969
The watchman!

01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:52.935
Three... one... four.

01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:54.812
314.

01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:09.326
- Everybody out!
- What?

01:19:09.494 --> 01:19:13.497
- The cops'll be here in five minutes.
- Damn it! Who called 'em?

01:19:13.623 --> 01:19:15.833
- The watchman rang the alarm.
- Let's scram!

01:19:16.168 --> 01:19:17.418
Hold it!

01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:19.128
Quiet down!

01:19:20.005 --> 01:19:22.631
Five more minutes,
six more storage sheds.

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:25.009
Move it! Get going!

01:19:25.302 --> 01:19:27.720
Not like that!
Out of the way!

01:19:35.687 --> 01:19:37.730
<i>- He's not in here.
- Next door!</i>

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.065
<i>Come on! Faster!</i>

01:19:44.821 --> 01:19:47.531
<i>- He's not here either.
- Move on! Next door!</i>

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:57.208
<i>Quickly! We've only got
three minutes left!</i>

01:19:58.627 --> 01:20:00.628
<i>No padlock on this one...
he must be here!</i>

01:20:00.712 --> 01:20:01.796
<i>Open it!</i>

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:03.839
<i>- Something's jammed inside.
- Let me do it!</i>

01:20:03.965 --> 01:20:06.091
<i>Hurry! Only one minute left!</i>

01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:12.932
<i>There he is, the dog!</i>

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.185
Come on! Move it!

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.647
Everybody out!

01:20:20.565 --> 01:20:22.608
Get out while you can, damn it!

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:24.693
Move it!

01:20:26.613 --> 01:20:28.864
For Christ's sake, get going!

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.243
What's keeping the others?
- They're coming!

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:36.747
If not, they might as well stay here,
with or without the guy!

01:20:37.582 --> 01:20:40.376
What in the hell is keeping them?

01:20:40.627 --> 01:20:42.586
Finally! Thank God!

01:20:43.129 --> 01:20:47.800
Quick now! Go!
Make it snappy!

01:21:21.877 --> 01:21:23.752
<i>He's not down here.</i>

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:28.799
<i>Hey! Who pulled up the rope?</i>

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:33.554
Hey, who pulled up the rope?

01:21:35.807 --> 01:21:37.141
Bunch of morons!

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.532
Hello there.

01:21:53.658 --> 01:21:55.034
<i>Hands up!</i>

01:21:55.368 --> 01:21:59.121
How can I put my hands up
when I'm holding on to the rope?

01:21:59.247 --> 01:22:00.456
<i>Come out of there!</i>

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.718
I'm really innocent this time...

01:22:13.887 --> 01:22:15.554
...like a newborn babe.

01:22:20.018 --> 01:22:22.561
This may surprise you, Franz...

01:22:24.105 --> 01:22:25.522
but I believe you.

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:32.196
Then everything's in order,

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:33.822
and I can go now, right?

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:35.908
Just a moment.

01:22:38.703 --> 01:22:39.870
Cigarette?

01:22:40.038 --> 01:22:41.538
Uh-oh.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:56.011
I'll take your word for it, Franz...

01:22:57.389 --> 01:22:59.473
provided...

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:04.103
you can tell me...

01:23:05.522 --> 01:23:09.650
who the man was
that you were looking for

01:23:09.776 --> 01:23:12.736
and that you found in that building.

01:23:13.238 --> 01:23:14.905
I don't understand, Inspector.

01:23:16.157 --> 01:23:18.283
A man, you say?

01:23:19.786 --> 01:23:24.331
I know nothing about that.
There must be some mistake.

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:27.418
I know nothing.

01:23:27.544 --> 01:23:29.420
Nothing at all.

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:31.797
Of course.

01:23:32.757 --> 01:23:34.591
There's just one thing I don't get:

01:23:34.759 --> 01:23:36.552
why you're covering up

01:23:36.761 --> 01:23:39.096
for the gang
who left you in the lurch.

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:44.101
Fine friends, running off
when things heat up,

01:23:44.227 --> 01:23:46.145
leaving you right in the fire.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.564
Phooey!

01:23:50.775 --> 01:23:54.903
That ploy won't work with me,
Inspector.

01:24:21.723 --> 01:24:23.223
Listen...

01:24:28.938 --> 01:24:31.106
What can happen to me anyway?

01:24:31.691 --> 01:24:34.359
<i>Maybe a little property damage...
so what?</i>

01:24:35.278 --> 01:24:36.695
<i>Nothing was pinched!</i>

01:24:36.821 --> 01:24:38.822
<i>But something was pinched,
my friend!</i>

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:40.657
In fact, a good deal.

01:24:40.784 --> 01:24:43.410
What? Something got pinched?

01:24:45.288 --> 01:24:46.872
How much?

01:24:46.998 --> 01:24:50.417
Tell me what you know
and I'll do the same.

01:24:50.877 --> 01:24:53.587
I already told you.
I know nothing.

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:57.633
Very well.

01:25:00.887 --> 01:25:03.180
Give it some thought, Franz.

01:25:04.307 --> 01:25:10.521
Leave a man alone
for a couple hours...

01:25:11.523 --> 01:25:16.568
and a lot comes back to him
that he couldn't remember before.

01:25:18.905 --> 01:25:20.364
Take him away.

01:25:36.381 --> 01:25:38.215
Send the night watchman in.

01:25:41.553 --> 01:25:43.387
Mr. Damowatz.

01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:51.854
Please sit down.

01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:58.068
Now then, you said
in your statement...

01:25:58.862 --> 01:26:02.739
Listen carefully, in case
you have to testify under oath later.

01:26:06.077 --> 01:26:10.873
You clearly heard one of the burglars
say to the guy guarding you,

01:26:11.332 --> 01:26:15.169
"We got him. I found the guy.
He's in the attic".

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:18.255
Is that correct?
- Yes, Inspector.

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:26.096
Yes, I'll swear to that anytime.

01:26:27.265 --> 01:26:28.390
Good.

01:26:28.516 --> 01:26:31.018
Go home now
and recover from your ordeal.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:34.229
But please remain available
for further questioning.

01:26:34.397 --> 01:26:36.607
Of course, Inspector.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:40.694
Good morning, Inspector.

01:26:40.820 --> 01:26:42.196
Morning.

01:26:55.919 --> 01:26:59.338
Tell me, is Inspector Lohmann
in the building?

01:27:00.548 --> 01:27:03.425
He's talking to someone?
No, it doesn't matter.

01:27:03.801 --> 01:27:06.303
I'll come over myself.

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:11.558
What? I see.

01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:14.811
Hasn't come home yet, eh?

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:18.774
Did you keep an eye
on the old Winkler woman too?

01:27:19.025 --> 01:27:20.400
Come in.

01:27:21.152 --> 01:27:22.486
Come in!

01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:26.114
<i>- Am I disturbing you?
- No, come in.</i>

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:30.327
Listen, the whole block
is surrounded.

01:27:30.536 --> 01:27:33.997
If he decides to go home,
he has to run into us.

01:27:34.499 --> 01:27:36.708
So just keep on waiting.

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:40.212
If anything happens,
I'll be here at the precinct.

01:27:44.634 --> 01:27:46.009
Damn it!

01:27:52.642 --> 01:27:54.142
What do you want?

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:56.687
I wanted...

01:27:58.106 --> 01:28:00.023
to ask a favor of you.

01:28:03.361 --> 01:28:05.195
Dishwater again!

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.531
I wanted to ask you...

01:28:08.533 --> 01:28:11.201
Read this first.

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:19.376
- A statement?
- Yeah.

01:28:20.211 --> 01:28:22.212
An office building was broken into.

01:28:29.637 --> 01:28:31.179
Bennostrasse?

01:28:31.723 --> 01:28:33.432
<i>That's a respectable part of town.</i>

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:37.644
<i>Perhaps not that respectable after all.</i>

01:28:39.355 --> 01:28:40.772
<i>Hell, this is getting serious!</i>

01:28:49.824 --> 01:28:52.284
<i>What the... Did they mean to empty
the whole joint?</i>

01:28:54.245 --> 01:28:57.539
<i>What could they have been
looking for in the coal?</i>

01:28:58.916 --> 01:29:01.543
<i>Incredible! Unbelievable!</i>

01:29:04.922 --> 01:29:06.381
<i>I'll be damned!</i>

01:29:10.303 --> 01:29:12.095
<i>This is madness!</i>

01:29:15.266 --> 01:29:18.643
<i>Ah, so they were after
the savings bank!</i>

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:22.105
<i>Good God!
What could this mean?</i>

01:29:23.775 --> 01:29:26.109
<i>I don't understand at all.</i>

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:28.570
<i>They didn't even touch it?</i>

01:29:28.780 --> 01:29:31.990
<i>Must've been a bunch of real idiots!</i>

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:36.536
I'll be damned!

01:29:36.704 --> 01:29:38.997
Isn't that something?

01:29:39.248 --> 01:29:42.250
Nothing stolen,
but a man was carried off.

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:44.378
God knows where they took him.

01:29:44.629 --> 01:29:46.296
That's just great.

01:29:46.631 --> 01:29:49.549
And Franz isn't talking.

01:29:49.675 --> 01:29:51.134
He's afraid, of course.

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:56.348
I know him well. Guy like him would
rather jump out the fifth-floor window

01:29:56.474 --> 01:29:58.433
than be mixed up in a murder rap.

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:05.899
What if we could
get at him from that angle?

01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:10.487
Lohmann, if you'd be willing
to help me out...

01:30:13.908 --> 01:30:15.784
Very clever.

01:30:16.285 --> 01:30:18.245
I see the wheels turning.

01:30:19.997 --> 01:30:22.958
Let's send for this Franz.

01:30:27.088 --> 01:30:28.713
You're wanted for questioning.

01:30:30.049 --> 01:30:33.051
What? They sent four guys for me?

01:30:33.344 --> 01:30:35.804
What's this about?
- Move it!

01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:01.913
"Homicide squad.

01:31:02.665 --> 01:31:06.334
Inspector Karl Lohmann".

01:31:11.799 --> 01:31:13.925
What do you want with me?

01:31:14.343 --> 01:31:17.262
What have I got to do
with the homicide squad?

01:31:28.232 --> 01:31:30.066
Yes, young man...

01:31:31.152 --> 01:31:33.403
your case has been turned over to me.

01:31:37.366 --> 01:31:39.075
But why?

01:31:41.787 --> 01:31:43.038
Why?

01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:48.752
You boys did your work
a little too well.

01:31:55.426 --> 01:31:57.302
<i>One of the watchmen...</i>

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:08.021
Dead?

01:32:13.277 --> 01:32:15.195
Accessory to murder.

01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:18.406
Nasty business.

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:21.576
Inspector, I've had enough!

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:23.745
I want no part of this!

01:32:23.871 --> 01:32:26.706
I'll tell you everything I know!

01:32:27.750 --> 01:32:30.126
Very sensible,
but, unfortunately, too late.

01:32:30.336 --> 01:32:33.004
It can't be too late!

01:32:33.130 --> 01:32:35.507
It can't be!

01:32:36.050 --> 01:32:38.176
I'll tell you everything!

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:42.389
Even what we were looking for
in that damn building.

01:32:42.640 --> 01:32:44.015
Well...

01:32:45.309 --> 01:32:47.102
The child murderer!

01:32:57.738 --> 01:32:59.030
What?

01:32:59.949 --> 01:33:01.241
Who?

01:33:01.659 --> 01:33:03.868
The child murderer, Inspector.

01:33:10.167 --> 01:33:11.835
Just a moment.

01:33:29.979 --> 01:33:32.439
This had to happen to me!

01:33:35.901 --> 01:33:38.653
Me, of all people.

01:33:46.203 --> 01:33:48.079
Come sit down, my boy.

01:33:52.293 --> 01:33:56.421
We're gonna level
with each other, got it?

01:33:56.964 --> 01:33:58.214
Certainly, Inspector.

01:33:58.424 --> 01:34:01.176
And God help you
if you pull something.

01:34:02.219 --> 01:34:03.720
Now then...

01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:06.389
what have you boys got to do
with the murderer,

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:09.434
and where was the guy taken?

01:34:11.896 --> 01:34:14.814
Well, Inspector...

01:34:16.233 --> 01:34:20.570
you know the old
Kuntz & Levy distillery?

01:34:21.155 --> 01:34:23.907
<i>The one that went belly-up
in the Depression?</i>

01:34:24.033 --> 01:34:26.451
<i>That's the one.</i>

01:34:26.577 --> 01:34:29.871
<i>Since then, the building's stood empty,
and no one gives a damn about it.</i>

01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:52.435
Get out here! Move it!

01:34:55.272 --> 01:34:57.107
Let me go!

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.951
What have I done to you?

01:35:08.077 --> 01:35:09.160
You swine!

01:35:09.286 --> 01:35:12.580
Let go of me!

01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:17.711
Bastards!

01:35:18.504 --> 01:35:21.214
Swine!
What do you want from me?

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.299
What do you want...

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:54.581
Help!

01:35:54.707 --> 01:35:58.626
Help! Let me out of here!

01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:01.171
I want out!

01:36:01.380 --> 01:36:03.423
Let me out of here!

01:36:03.549 --> 01:36:06.509
You'll never get out of here.

01:36:07.762 --> 01:36:10.180
Gentlemen, I beg of you!

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:13.516
I don't even know
what you want with me.

01:36:13.768 --> 01:36:15.977
I beg you, let me go.

01:36:16.187 --> 01:36:19.522
This whole thing must be a mistake!

01:36:20.733 --> 01:36:22.192
A mis...

01:36:24.153 --> 01:36:25.737
No.

01:36:26.322 --> 01:36:29.115
No mistake.
Out of the question.

01:36:29.742 --> 01:36:31.993
This is no mistake.

01:36:37.708 --> 01:36:39.375
No.

01:36:40.085 --> 01:36:41.836
No mistake.

01:36:45.966 --> 01:36:47.634
You recognize this?

01:36:47.885 --> 01:36:52.597
You bought a balloon just like this
for little Elsie Beckmann.

01:36:52.723 --> 01:36:54.432
Just like this one.

01:37:00.147 --> 01:37:02.065
No!

01:37:03.234 --> 01:37:06.319
Where did you bury
little Marga Perl, you bastard?

01:37:11.242 --> 01:37:13.284
But I never...

01:37:14.119 --> 01:37:16.412
I never even met her!

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.251
You never even met her!

01:37:23.754 --> 01:37:25.964
I suppose you never
met her either, huh?

01:37:27.842 --> 01:37:29.050
Or her?

01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:33.763
You never met her either, huh?

01:37:34.765 --> 01:37:36.432
- Stop him!
- Grab him!

01:37:36.559 --> 01:37:38.601
- Stop him!
- Don't let him escape!

01:37:38.769 --> 01:37:40.520
Watch out! The door!

01:37:41.438 --> 01:37:43.940
- Let me out!
- Punch him in the face!

01:37:44.108 --> 01:37:46.860
Let go of me!

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:12.635
- You have no right to treat me this way!
- We'll show you we do!

01:38:12.845 --> 01:38:15.430
You have no right to hold me here!

01:38:15.639 --> 01:38:19.100
Right? There's only one thing
right for a man like you... death!

01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:21.352
- Right! Kill him!
- Kill the rabid dog!

01:38:21.478 --> 01:38:23.354
- Ice him!
- Let him have it!

01:38:23.606 --> 01:38:25.106
Quiet!

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:26.983
Kill him!

01:38:36.368 --> 01:38:38.995
You spoke of "right" just now.

01:38:40.164 --> 01:38:42.290
We will be your right.

01:38:43.667 --> 01:38:47.170
Everyone sitting here
is an expert in the rule of law!

01:38:50.132 --> 01:38:52.383
From six weeks in Tegel prison...

01:38:52.801 --> 01:38:55.345
to 15 years in Brandenburg.

01:38:58.641 --> 01:39:01.809
They'll make sure
you get your rights.

01:39:03.020 --> 01:39:04.979
You'll even have defense counsel.

01:39:06.273 --> 01:39:08.399
Everything according
to the letter of the law.

01:39:08.859 --> 01:39:10.693
Defense counsel?

01:39:10.861 --> 01:39:13.821
I need no defense counsel!
Who's gonna prosecute me?

01:39:14.114 --> 01:39:15.907
You, perhaps?

01:39:18.535 --> 01:39:19.410
Hey, you.

01:39:19.662 --> 01:39:23.706
If I were you,
I wouldn't make big speeches.

01:39:23.874 --> 01:39:27.669
Your head's at stake here,
in case you hadn't noticed.

01:39:28.587 --> 01:39:30.964
And just who are you?

01:39:33.050 --> 01:39:38.096
I have the dubious pleasure
of serving as your defense.

01:39:39.014 --> 01:39:41.432
Though I'm afraid
it won't do you much good.

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:47.647
Do you all want to kill me?
You want to just wipe me out?

01:39:48.232 --> 01:39:51.859
We simply want to put you
out of commission.

01:39:52.861 --> 01:39:55.279
And we'll only be sure
of that when you're dead.

01:39:55.406 --> 01:39:58.449
But you can't murder me
just like that!

01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:04.747
I demand to be handed over
to the police!

01:40:08.085 --> 01:40:12.880
I demand to be brought
before a real court of law!

01:40:14.133 --> 01:40:15.883
That's a good one!

01:40:16.010 --> 01:40:18.553
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Look who's talking!

01:40:18.762 --> 01:40:21.723
So you can plead insanity

01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:25.018
and spend the rest of your life
being cared for by the state.

01:40:25.227 --> 01:40:28.980
And then you break out of the asylum
or receive a pardon,

01:40:29.356 --> 01:40:32.734
and you're happy as can be,
free to kill with impunity,

01:40:33.277 --> 01:40:36.821
protected by law
on grounds of insanity...

01:40:37.197 --> 01:40:41.159
and you're back to chasing little children!
No, no more of that!

01:40:41.702 --> 01:40:44.287
You must be taken out of action!
You must go!

01:40:45.289 --> 01:40:48.207
But I can't help it!

01:40:53.464 --> 01:40:54.797
I can't...

01:40:55.132 --> 01:41:00.344
I really can't... help it!

01:41:02.765 --> 01:41:04.182
We know that one!

01:41:04.808 --> 01:41:07.143
Before the judge,
we all "can't help it".

01:41:14.026 --> 01:41:15.902
What would you know?

01:41:16.195 --> 01:41:18.196
What are you talking about?

01:41:18.614 --> 01:41:20.948
Who are you anyway?

01:41:21.825 --> 01:41:23.367
Who are you?

01:41:23.786 --> 01:41:25.745
All of you.

01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.747
Criminals.

01:41:28.874 --> 01:41:31.584
Probably proud of it, too...

01:41:31.919 --> 01:41:34.003
proud you can crack a safe

01:41:34.171 --> 01:41:37.131
or sneak into houses
or cheat at cards.

01:41:37.382 --> 01:41:41.344
All of which it seems to me
you could just as easily give up

01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:44.097
if you had learned something useful,

01:41:44.223 --> 01:41:46.182
or if you had jobs

01:41:46.391 --> 01:41:48.935
or if you weren't such lazy pigs.

01:41:50.395 --> 01:41:52.021
But me?

01:41:52.356 --> 01:41:55.358
Can I do anything about it?

01:41:56.527 --> 01:42:00.530
Don't I have
this cursed thing inside me?

01:42:01.532 --> 01:42:04.700
This fire, this voice, this agony?

01:42:08.497 --> 01:42:10.873
So you mean to say...

01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:13.793
<i>you have to kill?</i>

01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:21.801
I have to roam the streets endlessly,

01:42:22.427 --> 01:42:24.470
always sensing

01:42:24.930 --> 01:42:27.640
that someone's following me.

01:42:27.766 --> 01:42:29.392
It's me!

01:42:29.768 --> 01:42:31.727
I'm shadowing myself!

01:42:33.063 --> 01:42:34.897
Silently...

01:42:35.399 --> 01:42:37.400
but I still hear it!

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:42.155
Yes, sometimes I feel

01:42:42.281 --> 01:42:44.282
like I'm tracking myself down.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:48.077
I want to run...
run away from myself!

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:50.913
But I can't!
I can't escape from myself!

01:42:51.748 --> 01:42:54.917
I must take the path
that it's driving me down

01:42:55.085 --> 01:42:59.839
and run and run
down endless streets!

01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:02.175
I want off!

01:43:03.927 --> 01:43:07.221
And with me run the ghosts

01:43:07.598 --> 01:43:11.017
of the mothers and children.

01:43:11.143 --> 01:43:14.896
They never go away.
They're always there!

01:43:15.105 --> 01:43:16.606
Always!

01:43:16.732 --> 01:43:18.441
Always!

01:43:19.610 --> 01:43:21.194
Except...

01:43:21.778 --> 01:43:23.779
when I'm doing it...

01:43:24.656 --> 01:43:27.033
when I...

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:36.834
Then I don't remember a thing.

01:43:37.794 --> 01:43:42.215
Then I'm standing before a poster,

01:43:42.341 --> 01:43:44.884
reading what I've done.

01:43:45.135 --> 01:43:47.178
I read and read...

01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:49.847
<i>I did that?</i>

01:43:50.474 --> 01:43:52.600
I don't remember a thing!

01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.645
But who will believe me?

01:43:55.812 --> 01:43:58.814
Who knows what it's like inside me?

01:43:58.941 --> 01:44:03.819
How it screams and cries out
inside me when I have to do it!

01:44:04.488 --> 01:44:06.155
Don't want to! Must!

01:44:06.490 --> 01:44:08.783
Don't want to! Must!

01:44:09.493 --> 01:44:12.453
And then a voice cries out,

01:44:12.579 --> 01:44:14.997
and I can't listen anymore!

01:44:15.290 --> 01:44:18.209
Help! I can't!

01:44:18.502 --> 01:44:21.837
I can't!

01:44:27.219 --> 01:44:29.428
The accused has stated

01:44:29.846 --> 01:44:31.931
that he can't help himself.

01:44:32.432 --> 01:44:36.227
<i>In other words,
he must commit murder.</i>

01:44:38.397 --> 01:44:41.190
With that he has pronounced
his own death sentence.

01:44:41.358 --> 01:44:42.692
Right!

01:44:42.859 --> 01:44:45.152
A man who claims

01:44:45.946 --> 01:44:49.240
that he's compelled
to destroy the lives of others...

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:53.452
such a man must be
extinguished like a bonfire!

01:44:53.620 --> 01:44:55.663
Such a man must be obliterated!

01:44:55.831 --> 01:44:57.373
Wiped out!

01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:08.759
May I address the court?

01:45:09.136 --> 01:45:11.178
Counsel for the defense
has the floor.

01:45:13.598 --> 01:45:17.560
My learned colleague
who just spoke...

01:45:18.895 --> 01:45:21.230
who is, if I'm not mistaken,

01:45:21.481 --> 01:45:24.358
wanted by the police
on three counts of manslaughter...

01:45:24.484 --> 01:45:26.694
That's irrelevant here.

01:45:26.903 --> 01:45:28.404
has claimed

01:45:28.697 --> 01:45:31.824
that the fact that my client
was acting compulsively

01:45:31.950 --> 01:45:33.743
warrants the death sentence.

01:45:33.994 --> 01:45:35.828
That's right!

01:45:36.413 --> 01:45:37.788
He is mistaken,

01:45:38.123 --> 01:45:42.084
because the very nature of compulsion
warrants an acquittal!

01:45:42.252 --> 01:45:43.794
Get outta here, will ya?

01:45:44.713 --> 01:45:45.963
Are you nuts, or plastered?

01:45:46.089 --> 01:45:47.882
It is precisely
the nature of compulsion

01:45:48.008 --> 01:45:51.594
that relieves him
of responsibility for his actions!

01:45:52.012 --> 01:45:55.556
And a man cannot be punished for that

01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:57.141
for which he is not responsible!

01:45:57.267 --> 01:46:01.812
- Ridiculous!
- You mean this monster should go free?

01:46:01.938 --> 01:46:03.606
That he should live?

01:46:03.732 --> 01:46:07.109
I'm saying that this man is sick,

01:46:07.235 --> 01:46:11.197
and you turn a sick man
over to a doctor, not an executioner.

01:46:11.323 --> 01:46:15.451
- Will you guarantee his cure?
- What does the state build asylums for?

01:46:15.619 --> 01:46:19.455
- What if he breaks out?
- Or he's declared cured and released?

01:46:19.581 --> 01:46:21.999
And one fine day
the killing starts all over?

01:46:22.667 --> 01:46:24.460
Another month-long manhunt!

01:46:24.586 --> 01:46:26.545
Once again the insanity clause,
once again the asylum!

01:46:26.671 --> 01:46:30.132
Another breakout or possible release!
And again... "must kill"!

01:46:30.842 --> 01:46:33.719
Is this supposed
to go on indefinitely?

01:46:33.887 --> 01:46:39.225
No one has the right to kill a man

01:46:39.351 --> 01:46:41.352
who cannot be held
responsible for his crimes!

01:46:41.603 --> 01:46:43.187
Not even the state,

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:46.273
and all of you least of all!

01:46:47.234 --> 01:46:52.113
The state must ensure
that this man is rendered harmless

01:46:52.447 --> 01:46:56.992
so that he ceases to be
a danger to society!

01:47:00.705 --> 01:47:02.998
You never had kids, did ya?

01:47:03.125 --> 01:47:05.209
Then you never lost any either.

01:47:06.837 --> 01:47:09.380
But if you wanna know what it's like

01:47:09.506 --> 01:47:12.508
when a little child is taken from you,

01:47:12.634 --> 01:47:15.928
just ask the parents
whose kids he took away!

01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:21.725
Ask 'em about the days and nights
not knowing what had happened,

01:47:22.477 --> 01:47:25.146
and later,
when they finally found out...

01:47:26.815 --> 01:47:29.275
Why don't you ask the mothers?

01:47:29.443 --> 01:47:31.735
You should ask the mothers!

01:47:32.028 --> 01:47:34.071
Think you'd get mercy
from any of them

01:47:34.197 --> 01:47:36.365
for murdering their kids?

01:47:36.533 --> 01:47:38.242
- The woman's right!
- Absolutely!

01:47:38.368 --> 01:47:40.369
No mercy for the killer!

01:47:40.495 --> 01:47:42.204
- Let him have it!
- Slaughter the bastard!

01:47:42.330 --> 01:47:45.207
- Kill the monster!
- Kill him!

01:47:45.375 --> 01:47:47.376
- Put the animal to death!
- Rub him out!

01:47:47.544 --> 01:47:49.420
- Kill him!
- Waste him!

01:47:49.546 --> 01:47:53.382
- Get rid of him!
- Annihilate the monster!

01:47:54.551 --> 01:47:57.887
I will not let you shout me down!

01:48:01.475 --> 01:48:08.063
I will not allow a murder
to be committed in my presence.

01:48:08.398 --> 01:48:11.317
I demand that this human being...

01:48:11.568 --> 01:48:12.860
That's not a human being!

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:16.280
that this human being be afforded
the same protection under the law

01:48:16.531 --> 01:48:18.199
rendered the common criminal!

01:48:18.408 --> 01:48:19.909
Not a chance!

01:48:20.076 --> 01:48:23.579
I demand that he be
handed over to the police!

01:48:23.705 --> 01:48:26.916
The police!
Of all the dumb...

01:48:53.944 --> 01:48:55.778
In the name of the law...

01:49:19.469 --> 01:49:21.136
In the name of the people...

01:49:21.304 --> 01:49:25.891
This will not bring
our children back.

01:49:30.939 --> 01:49:32.898
One has to...

01:49:33.567 --> 01:49:35.401
keep closer watch...

01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:39.488
over the children!

01:49:41.491 --> 01:49:42.992
<i>All of you!</i>
