WEBVTT

06:15.513 --> 06:16.617
Ready?

06:16.652 --> 06:17.756
Yeah. No pressure.

06:17.791 --> 06:18.861
Okay.

06:18.895 --> 06:19.896
Sweet.

06:21.691 --> 06:24.314
Most mammals are placentals,
like us.

06:24.349 --> 06:26.455
So we spend a long time
in the womb,

06:26.489 --> 06:28.077
and then we come out
fully formed.

06:28.111 --> 06:32.461
But most marsupials are only
pregnant for a few weeks,

06:32.495 --> 06:35.567
then, they grow outside
of the mother, in a pouch.

06:35.602 --> 06:37.327
-Right.

06:37.362 --> 06:39.640
Marsupials are
mostly nocturnal,

06:39.675 --> 06:42.643
um, which means that they
hunt for food at night.

06:42.678 --> 06:45.128
And we have
meat-eating carnivores,

06:45.163 --> 06:47.821
plant-eating herbivores
and omnivores,

06:47.855 --> 06:50.271
which basically just
eat whatever they can get.

06:53.240 --> 06:56.139
The wombat,
they have this
defence mechanism.

06:56.174 --> 06:58.279
It runs head-first
into its tunnel

06:58.314 --> 07:01.282
and then the dingo
sticks its head in
and tries to fight.

07:01.317 --> 07:03.526
The wombat
pushes its back up

07:03.561 --> 07:08.048
and crushes
the dingo's head against
the roof of the tunnel.

07:08.082 --> 07:09.774
Little hard-arse.

07:09.808 --> 07:11.292
I respect that.

07:14.710 --> 07:16.228
But on a serious note,

07:16.263 --> 07:20.716
Australia now has
more than 100
endangered species.

07:20.750 --> 07:24.651
And if we don't
get them help now,
they'll become extinct.

07:28.068 --> 07:31.312
It's Ben, master field
biologist.

07:32.279 --> 07:33.694
Hey!

07:33.729 --> 07:35.869
This is Bailey,
the film-maker
I told you about.

07:37.664 --> 07:39.735
They said it might be
hard to find a team
that wanted to do it,

07:39.769 --> 07:41.322
so I really appreciate it.

07:41.357 --> 07:43.428
Ben was the only one
who volunteered.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.568
Hey. Look,
none of the others would
have been any good.

07:45.603 --> 07:46.707
Trust me.

07:46.742 --> 07:48.916
Okay.

07:48.951 --> 07:51.229
Did you not
want to do it, Grace?

07:51.263 --> 07:53.921
I was just nervous
about being on camera.

07:53.956 --> 07:56.890
Oh, look, it's fine.
I totally get that.

07:56.924 --> 07:58.719
So if ever you guys
feel uncomfortable,

07:58.754 --> 08:01.619
just tell me and we'll do
something else.

08:01.653 --> 08:04.276
Wait, did you
already get filmed?

08:04.311 --> 08:06.071
I sounded like
a boring know-it-all.

08:06.106 --> 08:08.764
Ah, it's just who you are.

08:10.628 --> 08:15.391
Uh, my name's Matt.
Uh, I'm a park ranger.

08:15.425 --> 08:19.429
We, uh, we look after
thousands of hectares
of forest,

08:19.464 --> 08:21.431
so I'm on the road a lot.

08:21.466 --> 08:23.917
But every day,
there's always something
different happening.

08:23.951 --> 08:25.263
Okay.

08:25.297 --> 08:28.646
We maintain camp grounds,
control feral animals.

08:29.923 --> 08:31.476
And uh...

08:32.822 --> 08:35.031
-What else do we fucking do?

08:35.066 --> 08:37.482
Um, do you
wanna just tell me...

08:37.517 --> 08:39.795
Oh, yeah, we keep an eye out
for illegal hunting.

08:39.829 --> 08:42.107
And then
there's the bloody greenies,

08:42.142 --> 08:44.351
always getting into it
with the loggers.

08:44.385 --> 08:46.698
And then there's you lot,
from the government,

08:46.733 --> 08:50.046
who are always
checking in on us.
Never stops.

08:50.081 --> 08:53.015
Don't you work
for the government, Matt?

08:53.049 --> 08:56.018
Yeah, I... don't be
a smart-arse about it.

09:17.729 --> 09:18.765
Bailey?

09:20.594 --> 09:21.664
You okay?

09:22.734 --> 09:23.735
Yeah.

09:30.846 --> 09:34.194
He's got our coordinates,
but we can activate
the emergency beacon

09:34.228 --> 09:36.196
and send out a distress signal
if we need to.

09:36.645 --> 09:38.025
Love that.

09:39.199 --> 09:41.270
Oh, there's no reception
past here, so...

09:41.304 --> 09:44.825
we've got the satellite phone,
but if you wanna
message anyone,

09:44.860 --> 09:46.137
you should do it now.

09:48.277 --> 09:50.486
Nah, I'm good. Let's do it.

09:51.763 --> 09:53.247
Okay.

09:55.733 --> 09:56.734
Let's go.

09:59.322 --> 10:03.016
So, uh, what were you
doing before you decided
to follow us around?

10:03.050 --> 10:08.090
I usually shoot just like
corporate stuff,
safety videos and whatnot.

10:08.124 --> 10:10.195
Really exciting things.

10:10.230 --> 10:13.509
But then,
after the fires happened,

10:13.543 --> 10:17.893
I just wanted to
help make things better,
you know?

10:17.927 --> 10:20.861
At least I want to
feel like I'm trying.

10:20.896 --> 10:25.763
If we play a tiny part
in saving one single species,
it'll be worth it.

10:25.797 --> 10:30.768
Sure. But, I also
want my contribution
to be that

10:30.802 --> 10:34.357
I discover a species
that's never been seen before
and it gets named after me.

10:34.392 --> 10:35.358
-Amazing.

10:35.393 --> 10:36.463
Yeah.

10:36.497 --> 10:38.776
And what if it's
a swamp-dwelling rodent?

10:38.810 --> 10:39.984
Oh!

12:29.438 --> 12:32.130
-Hey?
-Yes.

12:32.165 --> 12:35.375
If I change my mind
about something I say,

12:35.409 --> 12:38.171
can I take back permission
to use it?

12:38.205 --> 12:40.967
Yes, you can revoke consent
at any time.

12:41.001 --> 12:44.073
Right, that's what you say now
and then later on,
you could be, like,

12:44.108 --> 12:46.248
"Oh, no,
you signed this form, so..."

12:46.282 --> 12:49.838
Yeah, well.

12:49.872 --> 12:54.739
And do you have
any tips for how to
be good on camera, or...

12:54.774 --> 12:57.259
you know, just
like how to be not shit?

12:57.293 --> 13:02.402
Top tip. Try not to
sound like your idea of how
you think you should sound,

13:02.436 --> 13:03.886
-if that makes sense.
-Um...

13:03.921 --> 13:06.786
Just use like your normal,
regular talking voice.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.098
Right, okay. Just talk
like a normal person.

13:09.133 --> 13:11.860
Yeah, like you're explaining
stuff to your friend,

13:11.894 --> 13:13.827
who doesn't know
anything about science.

13:13.862 --> 13:16.554
You know, you just
don't want to be condescending,
is the main thing.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.729
Oh! I mean,
that's the best thing
about being a scientist.

13:19.764 --> 13:21.697
Okay.

13:22.629 --> 13:24.596
Tell me about Ben.

13:24.631 --> 13:29.084
Yeah, I was one of those kids
that was just, like, obsessed
with dinosaurs.

13:29.118 --> 13:30.533
No.

13:30.568 --> 13:33.813
And I had this massive crush
on my biology teacher.

13:34.503 --> 13:36.125
Okay, yep. Right.

13:37.299 --> 13:38.783
Not like a sex thing.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.129
No, that's, um...

13:40.164 --> 13:41.786
It was a nerdy crush.
Like it...

13:41.821 --> 13:43.477
-I got it.
-Like a brain crush.

13:43.512 --> 13:45.514
I totally got it.
I just don't know if it's...

13:45.548 --> 13:48.344
-Do you want me to go again?
-Um...

13:48.379 --> 13:50.174
I think we've got it.

13:50.208 --> 13:53.798
So in order to survey
the bushfire regrowth area
for wildlife,

13:53.833 --> 13:56.905
we plant four of these
at every site,

13:56.939 --> 13:58.285
we leave them
for a month

13:58.320 --> 14:01.254
and they get activated
by heat and motion.

14:01.288 --> 14:04.360
What kind of animals
are we looking for?

14:04.395 --> 14:05.775
Koalas.

14:05.810 --> 14:08.261
Potoroos, a couple of
kinds of possums.

14:08.295 --> 14:12.782
And another 43
marsupial species
that also live in trees.

14:12.817 --> 14:14.784
How'd you end up
doing this job, Grace?

14:14.819 --> 14:17.649
Like, did you always
want to be an ecologist
in conservation?

14:17.684 --> 14:20.445
I've always loved animals.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.516
Kind of easier than people.

14:22.551 --> 14:24.104
Yeah.

14:24.139 --> 14:28.143
I wanted to
use science to help save
animals from extinction.

14:29.316 --> 14:31.318
And the work we do
is critical to that.

14:31.353 --> 14:35.184
But seeing how bad things are

14:36.116 --> 14:38.878
can be... overwhelming.

14:39.740 --> 14:41.432
So we count them

14:41.466 --> 14:44.262
and if we find the right number
of target species,

14:44.297 --> 14:47.162
they can't log the site.

14:47.196 --> 14:51.545
But sometimes,
we get overruled
and they log it anyway.

14:51.580 --> 14:53.202
You know, then I think,

14:53.237 --> 14:55.032
if we weren't out here
doing this kind of work,

14:55.066 --> 14:57.724
all the land will get cleared
and all the animals will die,
and...

14:58.759 --> 15:00.865
Yeah.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.904
We want to help
the animals but the thing we
have to save them from is us.

15:04.938 --> 15:08.183
It's the weight of all of that
that crushes you

15:08.217 --> 15:10.047
and makes you feel helpless.

15:10.081 --> 15:13.360
We have to make plans
for the future, even if
there isn't gonna be one.

15:13.395 --> 15:16.398
We have to keep going
and even when we fail,

15:16.432 --> 15:18.676
we have to get up
and try again.

15:18.710 --> 15:21.679
Do you believe that
science can save the world?

15:44.978 --> 15:46.842
BAILEY:
Hey, these are pretty chic.

15:46.876 --> 15:49.293
-These protect you...
-Shit...

15:49.327 --> 15:51.467
...from snakes,
spiders, ticks,

15:51.502 --> 15:54.712
leeches, bull ants,
itchy plants.

15:54.746 --> 15:55.851
Oh.

15:55.885 --> 15:58.198
Okay,
so quite useful, then.

16:01.650 --> 16:03.169
Scientist at work.

16:12.281 --> 16:13.558
What is it?

16:13.593 --> 16:17.493
It could be an extremely rare
swamp wallaby.

16:18.218 --> 16:20.048
It's a kangaroo.

16:20.082 --> 16:21.394
We're scientists, Ben.

16:21.428 --> 16:24.121
Yeah, I'm being accurate.
I'm doing my... my...

16:24.155 --> 16:25.294
Uh-huh.

16:25.329 --> 16:29.367
This could also be
a swamp-dwelling rodent.

16:29.402 --> 16:31.197
Bennicus ratticus?

16:31.231 --> 16:34.200
That's... that's exactly it.
Yeah, I'm gonna
name it after myself.

16:36.823 --> 16:40.137
We record the distribution
of species since the fires.

16:40.171 --> 16:41.931
Yeah.

16:41.966 --> 16:45.245
And then we use
the baseline data to track
any gradual changes.

16:45.280 --> 16:47.109
BAILEY:
Is there less diversity?

16:47.144 --> 16:49.284
GRACE:
Sometimes there's more.

16:49.318 --> 16:51.527
If you find animals
in new places,

16:51.562 --> 16:53.702
it means that
they've lost their homes.

16:53.736 --> 16:58.120
And that means that
they have to move to
other animals' territory.

16:58.155 --> 17:02.331
And these other animals
may want to eat them.

17:02.366 --> 17:06.128
I mean,
they are coming back.

17:06.163 --> 17:10.339
It's just that
the forest is a lot smaller,
so they're hungry.

17:10.374 --> 17:11.616
Mm.

17:11.651 --> 17:14.067
An hour after sunset
is peak feeding time.

17:14.102 --> 17:17.381
It's like everyone's
going to the same restaurant
at the same time,

17:17.415 --> 17:21.661
but some of the organisms
are going to discover
they're on the

17:21.695 --> 17:23.628
specials board.

17:23.663 --> 17:24.767
Oh!

18:12.125 --> 18:13.816
Mm.

18:18.235 --> 18:19.236
Oh!

18:29.108 --> 18:30.833
Oh, yeah.

18:33.112 --> 18:34.941
Excuse you, Goose.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.398
What is it?

18:44.744 --> 18:46.332
Skitchem!

19:56.885 --> 19:58.231
Goose?

20:03.478 --> 20:04.858
Goose?

20:16.663 --> 20:18.355
Goose!

20:30.712 --> 20:32.334
Goose?

20:43.414 --> 20:45.140
Goose, get here!

21:44.372 --> 21:45.787
Goose?

21:55.279 --> 21:56.660
Where are you?

21:57.661 --> 21:59.421
Bloody dog.

22:30.003 --> 22:31.419
Stop here.

22:33.282 --> 22:35.319
-Shall we try
something else?
-Yeah.

22:41.498 --> 22:43.085
Okay.

22:43.948 --> 22:45.640
-You ready?
-Yep.

23:02.691 --> 23:04.659
Can't believe that worked.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.976
That's a signature owl move.

23:12.011 --> 23:14.703
-That's so good!
-Don't make it lame.

23:15.497 --> 23:17.637
All right, let's keep going.

23:35.897 --> 23:38.727
Oh! Wait.

23:39.832 --> 23:41.558
What is it?

23:42.248 --> 23:43.905
Oh!

23:43.939 --> 23:46.010
-Aw.

23:46.045 --> 23:49.324
He's just waking up
from a little 20-hour nap.

23:49.358 --> 23:52.189
-Really? Twenty hours?
-Yeah.

23:52.223 --> 23:55.261
When he grows up, he'll eat
for three-and-a-half hours
and then, he might

23:55.295 --> 23:58.644
squeeze in half an hour of
screaming and grunting

23:58.678 --> 24:00.369
to try and get a girlfriend.

24:00.404 --> 24:02.199
Like you
on the weekends.

24:04.235 --> 24:06.168
Ouch.

24:06.203 --> 24:08.308
-Do you want a go?
-Yeah!

24:21.080 --> 24:22.944
Oh!

24:22.978 --> 24:24.635
Look, there's something there!

24:24.670 --> 24:26.257
You see it?

24:32.471 --> 24:33.610
Was.

24:34.749 --> 24:36.198
It's gone.

24:40.271 --> 24:41.307
Shh!

24:52.491 --> 24:54.285
Sorry. Sorry.

24:56.356 --> 24:57.599
So...

24:57.634 --> 25:00.188
Put down possible Morepork.

25:02.086 --> 25:04.917
Those owls have been
sighted on the mainland.

25:04.951 --> 25:06.608
I'm going to put unidentified.

25:08.955 --> 25:11.544
I had so many animals
when I was a kid.

25:12.338 --> 25:14.374
I mostly just bred mice.

25:14.409 --> 25:17.136
It was like a little
God-complex thing,

25:17.170 --> 25:20.553
I think that parents
force on their children...

25:20.588 --> 25:22.555
-...to teach them
about the world.

25:22.590 --> 25:24.177
-Oh, man.
-It's crazy. Um...

25:24.212 --> 25:27.111
-To teach them
about death.
-Yeah, pretty much.

25:27.146 --> 25:28.527
-Yeah.
-Oh.

25:28.561 --> 25:30.218
When I was a kid,

25:30.252 --> 25:32.531
I went on this
school excursion to the zoo

25:32.565 --> 25:35.637
and I kind of
wandered away from the group

25:35.672 --> 25:38.295
to check out
this really cool gorilla.

25:38.329 --> 25:42.092
I'm, like, looking down,
with all these kids
and families.

25:42.126 --> 25:47.200
We see this
little furry creature
about the size of a cat.

25:47.235 --> 25:51.619
I guess somehow
it just escaped
wherever it lives in the zoo

25:51.653 --> 25:53.828
and it's found its way
in with the gorilla.

25:53.862 --> 25:57.832
And all the kids are like,
"Oh", like, "Look at
that little fluffy thing!"

25:57.866 --> 25:59.696
Then the gorilla looks over,

25:59.730 --> 26:03.769
it takes him, like,
one second to catch it
and shows it to the crowd.

26:05.046 --> 26:09.291
And then he just starts
fucking beating it

26:10.879 --> 26:13.330
against a rock until it died.

26:15.228 --> 26:17.334
Like, the kids are screaming,

26:17.368 --> 26:19.992
like, parents are
trying to drag them away.

26:20.026 --> 26:22.373
And then he holds up
the little dead animal,

26:22.408 --> 26:24.893
and he starts
pounding on his chest.

26:27.655 --> 26:29.173
It was like,
he was saying, like,

26:29.208 --> 26:32.004
"Fuck you!"
Like, "If you wanna
put me in a cage,

26:32.038 --> 26:35.007
then you have to
see who I really am."

26:40.599 --> 26:42.117
I was so rattled.

26:42.152 --> 26:44.499
My heart was
pounding out of my chest

26:44.533 --> 26:46.674
and I remember
the zookeeper guy,

26:46.708 --> 26:49.746
like, walked past me
and I grabbed him by his sleeve

26:49.780 --> 26:51.333
and I was, like,
"You gotta go in there.

26:51.368 --> 26:54.267
"You gotta do something.
This is... This isn't right."

26:55.959 --> 26:58.996
And he just looked at me
and he just
shrugged his shoulders

26:59.031 --> 27:00.549
and he said,

27:00.584 --> 27:02.241
"I'm not going in there.

27:03.242 --> 27:05.002
That's his territory."

27:58.815 --> 28:01.369
Hey! Hey, Grace.

28:04.855 --> 28:06.305
Grace.

28:08.272 --> 28:11.586
I'm sorry.
What's... what's that?

28:13.139 --> 28:15.694
It's just
an expressive possum.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.766
Oh, of course.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.181
Okay, cool. Thanks.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.912
Uh, it's a brushtail.

28:28.845 --> 28:29.846
Brush-tail.

28:34.989 --> 28:37.716
Oh, and
that's a sugar glider.

28:42.548 --> 28:44.723
Do you wanna sleep in here?

28:47.380 --> 28:48.554
Go on.

28:50.383 --> 28:52.385
Yeah. Oh, okay.

28:56.148 --> 28:59.185
Thanks. Sorry.

29:29.215 --> 29:30.907
It's a southern boobook!

29:31.839 --> 29:33.702
I'm sorry, he's so annoying.

29:33.737 --> 29:36.050
I like him.

29:36.084 --> 29:39.329
He's like a kid
who wants to show you
all his tricks.

29:41.641 --> 29:44.368
It's none of my business,
but how do your partners feel

29:44.403 --> 29:46.785
about you guys
going on these trips for work?

29:48.856 --> 29:50.996
My ex was fine with it.

29:51.030 --> 29:54.654
And Ben hasn't had
a relationship since...

29:55.655 --> 29:57.174
like, ever.

29:57.209 --> 29:59.038
-Really?

29:59.073 --> 30:01.523
Oh.

30:05.079 --> 30:06.321
Hmm.

30:13.087 --> 30:14.157
Sorry.

30:14.882 --> 30:16.642
No, it's okay.

30:19.921 --> 30:21.543
My brother.

30:22.096 --> 30:23.373
Oh.

30:26.652 --> 30:28.688
He's not here any more.

30:30.518 --> 30:32.140
The fires last year.

30:34.142 --> 30:36.075
I'm so sorry.

30:39.630 --> 30:40.839
Thank you.

30:43.669 --> 30:45.567
He would have liked you guys.

30:46.706 --> 30:48.881
And loved what
we're doing out here.

31:01.687 --> 31:03.378
What is that?

31:05.001 --> 31:06.416
It's just a koala.

31:07.520 --> 31:08.867
Just a koala?

31:09.798 --> 31:10.765
Goodnight.

31:13.319 --> 31:15.045
Mm.

32:59.046 --> 33:01.289
Uh, did you sleep okay?

33:03.740 --> 33:05.362
No.

33:05.397 --> 33:07.261
Did you hear that koel bird?

33:07.295 --> 33:08.538
Uh, yeah.

33:08.572 --> 33:10.402
Oh!

33:10.436 --> 33:12.576
He was just whistling
his little heart out,
trying to meet someone.

33:12.611 --> 33:15.717
He sounded like his head
was going to explode.

33:15.752 --> 33:17.788
That's exactly
what it's like.

33:17.823 --> 33:21.482
Aw.

33:21.516 --> 33:24.830
Are you in need of
some short-term pair bonding?

33:24.864 --> 33:27.867
I mean, I am kind of amazing
at whistling, so...

33:32.700 --> 33:33.804
Hey.

33:33.839 --> 33:35.013
Hey.

33:36.635 --> 33:39.155
Uh, how was your...
your walk?

33:39.189 --> 33:40.535
Oh, it was amazing.

33:40.570 --> 33:44.194
So what's going on today?

33:44.229 --> 33:48.819
Ah, we're retrieving some
cameras that were left behind
by another team.

33:48.854 --> 33:50.925
That's still happening,
isn't it?

33:51.512 --> 33:53.031
Yeah, yeah.

33:53.065 --> 33:55.861
Yeah, right. Good, good.
I will break down this tent.

34:15.087 --> 34:17.469
Does it tell you
the exact spot?

34:17.503 --> 34:20.437
It pinpoints
within ten metres.

34:20.472 --> 34:21.645
-Oh.
-Yeah.

34:21.680 --> 34:25.028
Okay, should be
somewhere around...

34:25.063 --> 34:26.340
Ah, here!

34:26.374 --> 34:28.307
Do you watch it straight away?

34:28.342 --> 34:30.827
We don't have to,
but I always want to.

34:32.622 --> 34:35.866
All right,
let's find the others
and see what we've got.

34:35.901 --> 34:38.145
I'm always
desperately hoping
that we find

34:38.179 --> 34:41.148
a thriving population of
something rare and endangered.

34:43.115 --> 34:44.599
It's a feral cat.

34:44.634 --> 34:46.601
Oh...

34:51.399 --> 34:54.575
I mean,
I try not to think
of any animals as bad.

34:54.609 --> 34:57.336
I mean, it's not their fault
that they prey on
native wildlife.

34:57.371 --> 34:59.166
It's our fault
for bringing them here.

35:05.689 --> 35:08.485
-Ooh,
is that a brushtail?
-Yeah.

35:08.520 --> 35:11.902
One of the least endangered
species, unfortunately.

35:11.937 --> 35:14.008
Look at those
little beady eyes.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.783
Rabbits and rodents.

35:30.818 --> 35:32.820
Not even endangered rodents.

35:57.362 --> 35:58.846
I got it.

35:58.880 --> 36:02.021
We could probably
just move it, no?

36:02.056 --> 36:05.818
He has to use
all of his tools every trip
or he feels ripped off.

36:05.853 --> 36:07.061
Oh.

36:28.876 --> 36:30.774
Phew!

36:33.501 --> 36:36.194
Ooh. Thank you.

36:37.367 --> 36:38.886
It's a beautiful job.

37:20.099 --> 37:21.515
Ooh.

37:27.383 --> 37:30.558
These old
growth forests are
getting rarer and rarer.

37:40.085 --> 37:42.467
These trees are so beautiful.

37:45.435 --> 37:49.508
If we don't find
something endangered soon,
we could lose this whole forest.

37:54.479 --> 37:59.415
A hollow-bearing tree
just like this one supports
a diverse range of animals.

38:00.243 --> 38:01.693
If the tree is removed,

38:01.727 --> 38:03.419
then it can be
the final determinant

38:03.453 --> 38:06.387
in the extinction
of a local population.

38:06.422 --> 38:08.700
And the extinction
of one species

38:08.734 --> 38:11.944
can affect the survival
of, like, a whole lot
of other species.

38:15.465 --> 38:17.329
So fairly important, then.

38:45.426 --> 38:48.015
Man,
can we sit for a bit?

38:58.336 --> 39:01.753
Hey, can I borrow your shovel?

39:03.996 --> 39:06.102
Do you also need to
borrow my toilet paper?

41:16.715 --> 41:17.682
Quaint.

41:19.546 --> 41:21.858
Gold mining was
the only way to get rich,

41:21.893 --> 41:26.104
so people came out here
and built these little houses
and just started digging.

41:26.138 --> 41:28.693
Like, can you even
imagine that way of life?

41:28.727 --> 41:30.384
Actually, no.

41:30.418 --> 41:32.731
And now we have to
watch out for random holes
in the ground.

41:32.766 --> 41:34.802
-Random holes.
-Mm-hmm.

41:36.563 --> 41:39.497
Guys, can we get going?

41:40.670 --> 41:41.947
Almost there.

41:47.677 --> 41:49.058
Jesus.

41:49.092 --> 41:50.956
-You should have
got that on camera.
-Dammit!

41:50.991 --> 41:53.683
Are you all right, mate?

41:53.718 --> 41:54.960
You bleeding?

41:54.995 --> 41:58.308
Uh, yeah. It's a stream.
You see? You're next.

42:19.882 --> 42:21.849
GPS signal
is getting ropey.

42:22.574 --> 42:24.576
I need a better view.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.452
We should be somewhere
around here.

42:40.247 --> 42:41.835
It's so green.

42:44.596 --> 42:46.080
Oh, come on.

42:48.911 --> 42:50.429
Oh, whoa.

42:55.227 --> 42:56.781
Again.

42:59.059 --> 43:00.716
This keeps happening.

43:04.754 --> 43:06.273
Whoa.

43:06.307 --> 43:08.482
-Oh! What the...
-Jesus.

43:12.797 --> 43:14.419
Oh, my God.

43:14.453 --> 43:16.732
Looks like
somebody's been
having a nice dinner.

43:18.250 --> 43:19.735
Wow, look.

43:19.769 --> 43:21.357
-This bone's
been chewed on.

43:21.391 --> 43:23.911
By what?
What do you think's
been chewing on it?

43:23.946 --> 43:27.846
It could be feral pigs,
wild dogs, dingoes.

43:33.127 --> 43:35.578
The colour's variated.

43:35.613 --> 43:40.272
It could be from
more than one animal
and they got into a fight.

43:40.307 --> 43:43.897
Or it could be
from one animal
with camouflage markings.

43:45.312 --> 43:47.486
Looks like
these branches
have fallen down.

43:48.729 --> 43:51.007
There's been
some kind of struggle.

43:53.976 --> 43:55.840
This paw print.

43:58.739 --> 44:00.327
Do you have the plaster?

44:00.361 --> 44:01.984
Did you put it back
in my pack?

44:04.020 --> 44:05.781
You know what?

44:05.815 --> 44:08.818
Let's just see
if we got it on camera, hey?

44:11.959 --> 44:13.616
And...

44:13.651 --> 44:16.067
It's in still mode.

44:16.101 --> 44:18.586
Looks like it stopped recording
three weeks ago.

44:18.621 --> 44:20.347
Can you see anything?

44:20.381 --> 44:23.005
Uh, we got birds.

44:24.731 --> 44:26.215
We got some mice.

44:27.147 --> 44:28.493
Got an echidna.

44:30.460 --> 44:32.980
Ooh! A bush rat.

44:34.154 --> 44:36.604
-Look at him go.

44:36.639 --> 44:38.330
-Oh!
-Okay.

44:38.365 --> 44:40.781
Oh! Hello.

44:40.816 --> 44:43.266
A yellow-footed
rock wallaby.

44:43.301 --> 44:44.958
Are they rare?

44:44.992 --> 44:46.649
Very rare.

44:46.684 --> 44:48.789
Oh!

44:50.480 --> 44:53.414
-Aw.

44:55.900 --> 44:57.142
Oh.

44:57.177 --> 44:58.178
What?

44:58.972 --> 45:01.629
-Ah.
-What?

45:01.664 --> 45:03.701
-Okay.
-No, no, no. Just go...

45:03.735 --> 45:04.805
Yeah, yeah.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.013
No, go back to...

45:06.048 --> 45:07.566
All right, just
stop it.

45:08.153 --> 45:09.534
Gimme a sec.

45:11.674 --> 45:14.228
What's happened here?

45:14.263 --> 45:15.574
I don't know.

45:16.092 --> 45:17.059
What is it?

45:20.545 --> 45:22.340
We should call the ranger.

45:22.374 --> 45:26.033
The photos are old.
It's probably moved on
since the bait ran out.

45:26.068 --> 45:29.450
We're supposed to notify him
if we see any evidence
of feral animals.

45:29.485 --> 45:32.350
Yeah, well, maybe
it's not a feral animal.

45:32.384 --> 45:34.076
I don't know,
maybe it was a human.

45:36.181 --> 45:39.633
It's a long way
to fall.

45:39.667 --> 45:43.188
Somebody could be out there
crawling around
with a broken spine.

45:43.223 --> 45:45.397
And if it was you stuck
out here with a broken spine,

45:45.432 --> 45:47.296
what would you
want us to do?

45:47.330 --> 45:51.369
Oh, mate, I'd be fine.
I'd just eat some bugs,
drink a bit of urine.

45:58.272 --> 46:02.000
It's a lovely day
to be on the course,
ladies and gentlemen.

46:09.318 --> 46:11.285
Like a champion.

46:11.320 --> 46:13.011
-Oh!

46:13.046 --> 46:14.461
Sliced it.

46:17.222 --> 46:21.779
Oh, well. Look,
I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

46:26.887 --> 46:29.062
Right.

46:29.096 --> 46:34.067
Well, you just sit tight
and I'll come and see ya.

46:34.101 --> 46:37.242
Anyone's up to anything
dodgy in my jurisdiction,

46:37.277 --> 46:39.313
they'll have some pretty
hefty fines to pay.

46:42.144 --> 46:44.802
Oh, did you get yourself
into a bit of trouble,
did you?

46:45.664 --> 46:47.390
Right.

46:47.425 --> 46:49.530
Yeah, well,
that's what they all say.

46:53.569 --> 46:57.538
Yeah, well,
I don't mind getting myself
into a bit of argy-bargy.

46:57.573 --> 46:59.817
Makes the day fun.

47:01.439 --> 47:03.165
Gotcha.

47:03.199 --> 47:04.718
I'll send you
the coordinates.

47:05.443 --> 47:06.582
Righto.

47:07.341 --> 47:08.860
I'll come and find ya.

47:08.895 --> 47:10.724
Yeah, for sure. Uh...

47:11.311 --> 47:12.899
Yeah, uh...

47:12.933 --> 47:13.900
Thanks.

47:15.004 --> 47:17.144
-Bye.
-No worries, Ben.

47:19.491 --> 47:22.080
He's probably lonely.

47:22.115 --> 47:24.945
They should make it so
everyone gets a partner.

47:24.980 --> 47:27.845
I mean, can you imagine
if we had to do
this job by ourselves?

47:31.987 --> 47:33.298
What?

47:46.035 --> 47:48.072
Hey, guys.

47:48.106 --> 47:49.867
Come check this out
real quick.

47:59.911 --> 48:01.671
Look at these.

48:01.706 --> 48:03.639
Can you see it?
Look at these scratches here.

48:06.193 --> 48:07.885
See those?

48:07.919 --> 48:09.610
That's claw marks.

48:11.992 --> 48:13.304
What...

48:13.994 --> 48:15.375
What?

48:20.069 --> 48:22.382
Look at that. Two thumbs.

48:22.416 --> 48:25.903
Some marsupials have them
for climbing and hunting.

48:28.733 --> 48:30.321
Have we got any bait left?

48:30.355 --> 48:31.322
No.

48:33.703 --> 48:36.465
It was hunting here
because we gave it a handy
little food source.

48:38.777 --> 48:42.954
So you want to lure more
unsuspecting animals
to their deaths?

48:42.989 --> 48:45.646
In the name of science.

48:45.681 --> 48:47.959
You know for a fact
Matt will kill it
if we can't ID it.

49:45.223 --> 49:46.190
Here we go.

49:47.122 --> 49:48.123
Oh. Yes!

50:47.458 --> 50:50.323
-What's all this about?

51:22.044 --> 51:23.563
Hello?

52:21.414 --> 52:23.519
Guys. I think
I know what it is.

52:42.952 --> 52:46.301
-Carni-what?

52:46.335 --> 52:49.269
It's a large
carnivorous marsupial

52:49.304 --> 52:51.271
that's probably nocturnal.

52:51.306 --> 52:54.378
And it's arboreal,
which is consistent
with the colour variation

52:54.412 --> 52:56.103
of the fur we found.

52:56.138 --> 52:58.589
Whatever
scratched up that tree
has two thumbs.

52:58.623 --> 53:01.454
Your megafauna carnifex
only has one thumb.

53:02.524 --> 53:04.181
Maybe it's a sub-species.

53:05.423 --> 53:06.493
Sure.

53:06.528 --> 53:08.633
The Somali elephant shrew,
yeah?

53:08.668 --> 53:12.119
It was thought to be extinct
and they found a bunch of them
living in the desert.

53:12.154 --> 53:15.157
The elephant shrew
wasn't seen for 50 years.

53:15.192 --> 53:20.300
Thylacoleo carnifex
hasn't been seen
for 50,000 years.

53:20.335 --> 53:23.338
Well, maybe
they've been living
out in the forest

53:23.372 --> 53:26.513
peacefully killing things
for dozens of years.

53:26.548 --> 53:29.999
And then the bushfires
completely ravage
their ecosystem,

53:30.034 --> 53:33.244
so they're forced
to move to new territory,
closer to humans.

53:33.279 --> 53:38.767
Look, the history of evolution
tells us that...
hmm, life finds a way.

53:43.461 --> 53:44.945
Guys!

53:44.980 --> 53:47.016
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

53:48.639 --> 53:50.779
It's the thing
drop-bears are based on.

53:50.813 --> 53:54.196
Um, I thought that was
just a made-up story
to scare tourists.

53:54.231 --> 53:56.060
It is.

53:56.094 --> 53:59.374
Yeah, but it's based
on a real creature
and it's nothing like a bear.

53:59.408 --> 54:01.134
Are we...
We're not in...

54:01.168 --> 54:02.239
you know, danger?

54:03.550 --> 54:04.793
Well, I don't know!

54:04.827 --> 54:06.864
I don't know
why you're laughing.

54:06.898 --> 54:07.899
Oh, my God.

54:42.486 --> 54:44.971
-Settle.

54:50.735 --> 54:52.599
Yeah, good dog.

54:54.636 --> 54:55.947
All right.

54:55.982 --> 54:58.571
-Rolling.
-Okay. So...

54:59.572 --> 55:01.367
In ancient Rome,

55:01.401 --> 55:04.404
the public executioner
was called the Carnifex

55:04.439 --> 55:08.270
and that literally translates
to "the maker of meat".

55:08.305 --> 55:11.100
Then you wind it back
a few million years,

55:11.135 --> 55:12.964
to the last days
of the dinosaurs,

55:12.999 --> 55:15.277
the ancient ancestors
of marsupials

55:15.312 --> 55:17.141
were actually much bigger
than they are now,

55:17.175 --> 55:19.730
and T. Carnifexwas
one of those animals.

55:19.764 --> 55:21.421
It's highly territorial

55:21.456 --> 55:24.321
so if you stray
into its hunting ground,
it will kill you.

55:26.150 --> 55:29.602
But it's not just gonna
chase you across open ground
like a lion.

55:29.636 --> 55:31.017
Oh, no, no, no.

55:33.640 --> 55:36.402
They're an ambush
predator, and that means
that they will hunt you.

55:37.161 --> 55:38.265
Stalk you.

55:38.300 --> 55:40.992
In the forest, like a tiger,

55:43.305 --> 55:44.996
and then they'll jump you.

55:46.204 --> 55:47.620
Oh, my God.

55:49.035 --> 55:51.658
It bites down
through your jugular.

55:56.145 --> 55:58.009
It severs your spinal cord.

56:09.607 --> 56:11.575
Holy shit!

56:11.609 --> 56:13.784
Wait, how did that
ever die out?

56:13.818 --> 56:15.924
Well,

56:15.958 --> 56:19.583
the currently accepted science
is that it was naturally
occurring climate change.

56:21.688 --> 56:23.034
Yeah, right.

56:28.661 --> 56:32.699
So, where's old mate?

56:34.529 --> 56:36.013
Do we know?

56:36.047 --> 56:38.084
Did you
check the coordinates?

56:38.118 --> 56:39.913
He might be
in the wrong place.

56:39.948 --> 56:41.812
Yeah, I checked.

56:41.846 --> 56:43.676
So call him.

56:43.710 --> 56:47.334
I'll message.
Sure, just for you.

56:57.517 --> 56:59.657
What did you say?

56:59.692 --> 57:03.454
Don't worry, didn't tell him
about my genius
megafauna theory.

57:03.489 --> 57:06.250
I said, we think
it's a native species,

57:06.284 --> 57:08.563
so if he sees anything,
don't kill it.

57:48.085 --> 57:49.051
Did you hear that?

57:50.536 --> 57:51.502
Huh?

57:53.400 --> 57:54.367
Grace?

57:57.888 --> 57:59.579
There's something
moving out there.

58:04.446 --> 58:05.447
What is it?

58:06.275 --> 58:08.105
I don't know. Can't see.

58:17.908 --> 58:18.978
Yeah.

58:19.012 --> 58:20.393
Got the spotlight.

58:20.427 --> 58:21.601
No, no, no,
it might run away.

58:21.636 --> 58:22.637
Just hang on.

58:38.618 --> 58:39.688
Oh, Ben!

58:41.483 --> 58:43.209
God's sake.

58:45.245 --> 58:48.283
Never been happier
to see a goat
in my entire life.

58:48.317 --> 58:51.044
You know, feral goats
erode the soil
and reduce plant diversity.

58:51.079 --> 58:53.322
Oh, Ben, not now. Jeez.

58:53.357 --> 58:55.497
-It's true.

58:55.532 --> 58:57.637
I'm just saying,
it's nothing to celebrate.

58:59.018 --> 59:01.296
It kind of is for me,
actually.

59:01.330 --> 59:03.574
No, no,
I'm not trying to be
at you or anything.

59:03.609 --> 59:05.024
I'm just saying, you know...

59:05.680 --> 59:06.991
Okay, sweet.

59:24.561 --> 59:25.769
Did you hear that?

59:36.711 --> 59:38.195
Oh, my God.

59:38.229 --> 59:39.576
Whoa.

59:40.300 --> 59:41.578
Oh.

59:45.547 --> 59:46.928
What the fuck is that?

59:50.483 --> 59:52.312
We have to get closer
to ID it.

59:58.836 --> 1:00:02.668
This is historic.
I mean, we're gonna be
in biology books.

1:00:02.702 --> 1:00:04.739
It's unbelievable.

1:00:05.463 --> 1:00:07.327
-Okay.
-Oh, my God.

1:00:07.362 --> 1:00:10.607
-It could be the last
of its species.

1:00:10.641 --> 1:00:12.574
I bet it's a sub-species.

1:00:15.853 --> 1:00:19.685
Whatever it is,
we could get this
entire forest protected.

1:00:19.719 --> 1:00:21.687
-Oh, my God.

1:00:21.721 --> 1:00:23.067
What's it doing?

1:00:23.102 --> 1:00:25.552
Maybe it's eating?
Or hiding its food?

1:00:25.587 --> 1:00:27.002
Whoo, okay.

1:00:27.037 --> 1:00:29.039
It's like a leopard.
It stows its prey.

1:00:33.353 --> 1:00:35.321
Hey, Bailey! Ready?

1:00:35.355 --> 1:00:38.324
We're good to go. Okay.

1:00:39.152 --> 1:00:41.154
Okay, coming around.

1:00:41.189 --> 1:00:42.811
Okay, bring it in,
but slow.

1:00:42.846 --> 1:00:44.468
-Yep.
-Slowly.

1:00:44.502 --> 1:00:45.952
It needs to go higher.

1:00:45.987 --> 1:00:47.644
Really don't want to
scare it.

1:00:48.472 --> 1:00:49.715
Keep going.

1:00:49.749 --> 1:00:51.164
Almost there.

1:00:51.199 --> 1:00:52.718
Yeah, just tell me
if I'm getting too close.

1:00:52.752 --> 1:00:54.616
Yep, okay. Yep, yep.

1:00:54.651 --> 1:00:56.031
-Careful.

1:00:56.066 --> 1:00:58.482
-You see that?
-We're getting
too close.

1:00:58.516 --> 1:01:00.380
Just... Just hover it
right next to it.

1:01:00.415 --> 1:01:02.866
Ben,
we're gonna freak it out.

1:01:04.350 --> 1:01:05.592
She's right.

1:01:05.627 --> 1:01:07.387
It's moving. Shit.

1:01:07.422 --> 1:01:08.872
No. Oh, no!

1:01:08.906 --> 1:01:10.390
It's gone.

1:01:10.425 --> 1:01:12.082
No, we can't... Shit!

1:01:12.116 --> 1:01:13.566
Where... No!

1:01:13.600 --> 1:01:14.671
Stay here.

1:01:14.705 --> 1:01:17.156
Ben! Wait! Ben!

1:01:21.263 --> 1:01:22.230
Ben!

1:01:28.857 --> 1:01:31.170
Ben!

1:01:51.397 --> 1:01:52.674
Come on.

1:02:15.904 --> 1:02:16.905
Grace?

1:02:23.084 --> 1:02:25.362
-Grace?

1:02:28.089 --> 1:02:29.090
Shit!

1:02:29.884 --> 1:02:30.885
Fuck!

1:02:31.333 --> 1:02:32.403
You okay?

1:02:35.821 --> 1:02:36.787
Uh...

1:02:39.272 --> 1:02:40.860
No, no, don't move.

1:02:40.895 --> 1:02:42.413
I'll come down.

1:02:42.448 --> 1:02:44.346
Then we'll both
get stuck in here.
Just get the rope.

1:02:44.381 --> 1:02:46.521
-No, that'll take way too long.
-Oh!

1:02:46.555 --> 1:02:47.522
Hold on a sec.

1:03:03.158 --> 1:03:04.815
Your chariot has arrived.

1:03:08.301 --> 1:03:10.062
This isn't you rescuing me.

1:03:11.270 --> 1:03:12.789
It's your fault I'm down here.

1:03:17.586 --> 1:03:19.243
When we get out of here,
we should...

1:03:23.869 --> 1:03:24.939
Ben?

1:03:28.287 --> 1:03:29.288
Ben?

1:03:32.429 --> 1:03:33.810
Ben!

1:03:36.605 --> 1:03:37.572
Ben!

1:03:55.901 --> 1:03:58.800
Stay away,
stay away, stay away,
stay away, stay away!

1:04:06.981 --> 1:04:08.775
What?

1:04:08.810 --> 1:04:11.468
Grace. Grace!

1:04:54.787 --> 1:04:56.962
Hello? Hello!

1:05:20.778 --> 1:05:21.952
Oh, my God!

1:05:39.038 --> 1:05:40.764
BAILEY:
Keys, key, key, keys!

1:05:40.798 --> 1:05:41.799
Fuck!

1:06:27.949 --> 1:06:28.985
Fuck.

1:07:06.712 --> 1:07:08.403
Hey. Hey!

1:07:10.336 --> 1:07:11.820
Hey, buddy!

1:07:11.855 --> 1:07:13.408
Hey, you wanna get in?

1:07:14.513 --> 1:07:16.480
Come on. Come on!

1:07:17.378 --> 1:07:18.482
Come on!

1:07:23.694 --> 1:07:26.145
Come on. Come on, hop up!
Hop up! Good girl.

1:07:43.093 --> 1:07:45.785
Hey, what's that? Hey?

1:07:46.234 --> 1:07:47.649
Hey, buddy.

1:07:48.961 --> 1:07:50.583
Hey.

1:07:50.618 --> 1:07:52.171
What's your name?

1:07:52.206 --> 1:07:53.207
Goose.

1:07:54.035 --> 1:07:55.485
Hi, Goose.

1:07:58.212 --> 1:07:59.661
Hey.

1:08:01.560 --> 1:08:02.975
I'm Bailey.

1:08:06.116 --> 1:08:07.462
What do we do now?

1:08:09.085 --> 1:08:10.948
Maybe your person
will come and find us.

1:08:13.917 --> 1:08:16.299
You just stay with me.
It's okay.

1:10:32.711 --> 1:10:34.437
Oh!

1:15:41.157 --> 1:15:42.572
It's okay. It's okay.

1:15:43.159 --> 1:15:44.160
Come on.

1:15:45.817 --> 1:15:46.818
Shit!

1:15:47.853 --> 1:15:48.854
It's okay.

1:15:53.687 --> 1:15:55.551
What is it? What is it?
What is it?

1:15:58.657 --> 1:16:00.556
It's okay, it's okay.
Don't worry.

1:16:03.248 --> 1:16:04.249
It's okay.

1:16:07.735 --> 1:16:08.736
It's okay.

1:16:13.258 --> 1:16:14.362
-It's okay.

1:16:17.711 --> 1:16:19.471
Oh, my God!

1:16:20.541 --> 1:16:22.923
Ben... Ben. Ben is out there.

1:16:22.957 --> 1:16:24.062
He's out there.

1:16:24.096 --> 1:16:26.547
We have to go. We have to go.

1:16:26.582 --> 1:16:27.962
Let's go. Let's go!

1:16:30.551 --> 1:16:31.552
Here!

1:17:08.727 --> 1:17:10.384
It's Ben's!

1:17:28.022 --> 1:17:29.541
-Run!

1:17:31.716 --> 1:17:32.682
Goose!

1:17:34.788 --> 1:17:36.168
Where's Goose?

1:17:36.203 --> 1:17:37.342
Goose!

1:17:39.137 --> 1:17:40.725
We have to
get out of its territory.

1:18:05.025 --> 1:18:06.026
Here.

1:18:07.372 --> 1:18:09.236
You drive. I'll call for help.

1:18:13.447 --> 1:18:14.517
Goose!

1:18:14.551 --> 1:18:16.001
-Goose!

1:18:16.036 --> 1:18:17.382
Here, good dog.

1:18:18.141 --> 1:18:19.695
Okay.

1:18:31.741 --> 1:18:33.087
Now they can find us.

1:18:33.847 --> 1:18:34.848
Let's go.

1:18:58.803 --> 1:19:00.390
Just keep it steady.

1:19:06.396 --> 1:19:08.571
-Okay.
-Oh, fuck!

1:19:16.096 --> 1:19:17.097
Fuck!

1:19:18.546 --> 1:19:19.996
Give it more power.

1:19:33.665 --> 1:19:34.666
Come on!

1:19:36.254 --> 1:19:38.359
Slow, slow, slow. It's okay.

1:20:23.819 --> 1:20:25.303
Goose?

1:20:25.337 --> 1:20:27.546
Oh, fuck! Goose!

1:20:27.581 --> 1:20:30.411
Jump in.
We have to get it moving.

1:20:30.446 --> 1:20:32.344
We have to go!

1:20:46.772 --> 1:20:48.498
Keep going!

1:20:52.951 --> 1:20:54.332
Keep going.

1:20:58.646 --> 1:21:00.131
Gently!

1:23:35.976 --> 1:23:37.633
Bailey!

1:23:37.667 --> 1:23:38.668
Get in!

1:23:38.703 --> 1:23:39.704
-Get in!

1:23:45.123 --> 1:23:46.090
Grace!

1:23:47.332 --> 1:23:48.333
No!

1:23:51.405 --> 1:23:53.718
-No!

1:24:08.526 --> 1:24:09.665
Get back.

1:24:09.699 --> 1:24:10.976
Goose!

1:24:20.262 --> 1:24:21.677
One shot.

1:25:13.522 --> 1:25:16.421
It's gone, Grace. It's gone.
