WEBVTT

00:03.537 --> 00:06.437
I can't believe
Mom still gets actual magazines.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.272
You can get all this stuff
on your iPad.

00:08.274 --> 00:09.172
Wait --

00:10.942 --> 00:12.808
Try<i> that</i> with an iPad.

00:12.810 --> 00:16.210
Uh, I did. That's why
I'm reading a magazine.

00:17.513 --> 00:20.213
Ooh! Look! A review
of the new Ryan Gosling movie.

00:20.215 --> 00:21.714
Don't read that --
we're supposed to be surprised

00:21.716 --> 00:22.981
when we see it with Mom
tomorrow.

00:22.983 --> 00:24.482
Yeahhhhh.

00:24.484 --> 00:28.151
The thing is...
I kind of already saw it.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.952
Mandy! We promised!

00:29.954 --> 00:32.788
Now Mom's gonna look at us
with those big, sad anime eyes.

00:32.790 --> 00:35.657
We just won't tell her,
all right?

00:35.659 --> 00:37.492
It'll be fine.
Just don't crack, okay?

00:37.494 --> 00:39.460
Me? Crack?

00:39.462 --> 00:40.427
Please.

00:41.463 --> 00:43.329
Hi.
What are you guys doing?

00:43.331 --> 00:44.663
Uh,
just making a sandwich.

00:44.665 --> 00:46.197
Geez, Mom,
get off our backs.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.866
Eve is just mad
'cause we ran out of mayonnaise.

00:49.868 --> 00:51.300
How was your day?

00:51.302 --> 00:52.701
I'm a teacher.

00:52.703 --> 00:54.836
If I reach just one student,
it's a good day.

00:54.838 --> 00:56.470
Today was a bad day.

00:57.506 --> 00:59.806
So, you excited to see
the new Ryan Gosling movie?

00:59.808 --> 01:01.474
Yeah, I can't wait.

01:01.476 --> 01:03.042
I mean, I<i> can</i> wait.

01:03.044 --> 01:04.810
I can definitely wait,
right?

01:04.812 --> 01:06.678
Hey, what did happen
to all that mayonnaise?

01:06.680 --> 01:07.712
(door opens)

01:07.714 --> 01:09.880
Hey, Ryan.
Where's Boyd?

01:09.882 --> 01:11.715
Oh, I thought I was gonna
get hung up at work,

01:11.717 --> 01:13.149
so I asked Mike
to pick him up.

01:13.151 --> 01:15.718
But then I finished
my beer delivery super-fast.

01:15.720 --> 01:19.787
Oh. Were all of your deliveries
"light" beer?

01:20.856 --> 01:21.888
(laughs)

01:21.890 --> 01:24.991
(sighing)
Ah, jokes.

01:24.993 --> 01:26.325
Hey, speaking of which,
where are they?

01:26.327 --> 01:27.993
School let out
a half-hour ago.

01:27.995 --> 01:30.829
Dad might be lecturing
the history teacher<i> again.</i>

01:31.598 --> 01:34.165
(laughs)

01:34.167 --> 01:36.934
"Light beer."
So it was easier to carry.

01:36.936 --> 01:38.502
Right!
That's a good one.

01:38.504 --> 01:39.736
Hi, Dad.

01:39.738 --> 01:41.738
The line of cars
for pickup

01:41.740 --> 01:43.606
was three stupid blocks,

01:43.608 --> 01:47.442
so Grandpa parked his damn car,
and we walked home.

01:47.444 --> 01:49.310
It was
a private conversation!

01:50.546 --> 01:53.346
Nice. Yeah, that car line
is getting really slow.

01:53.348 --> 01:56.582
And laying on your horn
doesn't do any good.

01:56.584 --> 01:59.251
Look, he's six blocks from here.
Let him<i> walk</i> home.

01:59.253 --> 02:00.585
Mike, we've talked
about this, okay?

02:00.587 --> 02:01.919
I think
it's way too dangerous.

02:01.921 --> 02:03.520
You think
<i> everything's</i> dangerous.

02:03.522 --> 02:04.921
You know, it's starting
to rub off on that kid.

02:04.923 --> 02:06.289
He looked
at an ice cream truck,

02:06.291 --> 02:07.823
and he called it
"the diabetes wagon."

02:08.892 --> 02:10.291
Well, it<i> is,</i> okay?

02:10.293 --> 02:12.192
Do you want to know why
kids scream for ice cream?

02:12.194 --> 02:13.927
Because they're dying.

02:13.929 --> 02:16.462
Well, all of our kids
walked home from Clark every day

02:16.464 --> 02:17.796
without any problems.

02:17.798 --> 02:19.764
Mm. Except for
our little brother Oliver.

02:19.766 --> 02:21.432
Oh, but it's only been
five years.

02:21.434 --> 02:23.700
Little Ollie
might still turn up.

02:23.702 --> 02:25.935
You know what, don't even joke
about stuff like that, okay?

02:25.937 --> 02:27.603
There are child abductions
all the time.

02:27.605 --> 02:29.371
That's why I don't buy
into the whole

02:29.373 --> 02:31.373
free-range parenting thing.
-Okay, what is that?

02:31.375 --> 02:33.308
Is that where, like,
the kids live on the farm

02:33.310 --> 02:35.410
and learn to make
wooden furniture?

02:35.412 --> 02:38.413
Or wait --
what's Amish?

02:38.415 --> 02:40.314
It's this new movement

02:40.316 --> 02:42.983
where parents are letting their
kids play outside unsupervised.

02:42.985 --> 02:44.985
We used to call that
"childhood."

02:44.987 --> 02:47.587
I just don't see the upside in
letting Boyd walk home, all right?

02:47.589 --> 02:50.289
You know what, I work
with children every day, Ryan,

02:50.291 --> 02:52.557
and they need to be given
responsibility.

02:52.559 --> 02:54.825
I mean, a good kick in the ass
would be better,

02:54.827 --> 02:58.562
but then I would be
"unfit as an educator."

02:59.598 --> 03:02.599
That was fun today. Can I
walk home by myself tomorrow?

03:02.601 --> 03:04.067
Uh, I don't know about that,
buddy.

03:04.069 --> 03:06.335
Come on, Dad.
Please?

03:06.337 --> 03:08.170
I'll help you
save the whales.

03:09.473 --> 03:12.140
We won't serve whale
at Outdoor Man Grill.

03:14.010 --> 03:16.844
Fine. Okay? We will try it.
Cool!

03:16.846 --> 03:19.179
But look, you come right home
after school, okay?

03:19.181 --> 03:21.614
No stopping, no talking,
no playing.

03:21.616 --> 03:24.950
Sounds like childhood
in North Korea.

03:24.952 --> 03:28.786
Where you're probably allowed
to kick students in the ass.

03:28.788 --> 03:31.121
Lucky.

03:31.123 --> 03:33.356
Well, congratulations. You get
to walk home from school.

03:33.358 --> 03:35.591
Tonight we celebrate
with a big bowl of diabetes.

03:36.927 --> 03:39.994
-- Captions by VITAC --

03:43.766 --> 03:45.966
What's up, boss?

03:45.968 --> 03:47.133
This is terrible.

03:47.135 --> 03:49.101
Yeah, I know.
Work is boring.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.235
Let's go fishing.

03:51.438 --> 03:53.604
No, I'm talking about the
numbers from the kids' section.

03:53.606 --> 03:55.606
Yeah, I know. I mean,
nothing is moving.

03:55.608 --> 03:57.207
I'm thinking of doing away
with the whole thing.

03:57.209 --> 03:59.209
No, don't do that,
Mr. Alzate.

03:59.211 --> 04:01.211
We just got all in
this great new stuff,

04:01.213 --> 04:05.214
like this four-person tree swing
that's all like, "Wow!"

04:05.216 --> 04:07.049
And then
these bouncy moon shoes

04:07.051 --> 04:09.051
that are like,
"Thoing! Thoing! Thoing!"

04:09.053 --> 04:12.120
And then this water cannon
is all like, "Doosh!"

04:14.157 --> 04:16.023
I need to go
field-test this.

04:16.025 --> 04:18.325
This is your market
right here --

04:18.327 --> 04:20.727
26-year-olds
that live under power wires.

04:20.729 --> 04:22.562
His whole brain is
"Bvvvvvt."

04:22.564 --> 04:25.298
Dad, did you finish the new
ad layout for the restaurant?

04:25.300 --> 04:27.466
I need to get it
to the newspaper by 3:00.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.000
By 3:00? You better
get it there by 2:00.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.735
The newspaper might be
out of business by then.

04:30.737 --> 04:31.736
Ha ha.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.304
Hey,
so, uh, Ryan tells Me

04:33.306 --> 04:35.639
you talked him into
letting Boyd walk home today?

04:35.641 --> 04:37.574
Yeah. And since I'm on a roll,
maybe we could work on

04:37.576 --> 04:38.975
getting more gluten
back in your life.

04:38.977 --> 04:40.977
Ha ha ha.
No, this is good.

04:40.979 --> 04:43.679
I've been trying to get him to let
Boyd have a little more independence.

04:43.681 --> 04:46.314
No, this -- this is exactly why
we're not selling toys here.

04:46.316 --> 04:48.082
These parents are
too overprotective nowadays.

04:48.084 --> 04:51.718
My mom once for a birthday party
gave me a plastic gun.

04:51.720 --> 04:55.387
On the box, it said
"A great way to put out an eye."

04:55.389 --> 04:56.588
Okay, Ryan means well.

04:56.590 --> 04:58.356
He just watches the news
too much.

04:58.358 --> 04:59.190
The lefty news.

04:59.192 --> 05:00.591
All they're scared about

05:00.593 --> 05:02.759
is free enterprise
might make somebody rich.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.428
People being scared
is not the problem.

05:06.430 --> 05:08.396
No, no.
It's an opportunity.

05:08.398 --> 05:11.265
I'm thinking of
turning this whole section

05:11.267 --> 05:13.767
into a sales area
for preppers.

05:13.769 --> 05:15.201
Preppers?

05:15.203 --> 05:17.403
You mean the people
who hoard food and batteries

05:17.405 --> 05:20.072
and have hidden shelters
up in the mountains?

05:20.074 --> 05:22.107
The good ones can withstand
nuclear weapons.

05:22.109 --> 05:23.374
(chuckles)

05:23.376 --> 05:25.242
There's a word
for people like that.

05:25.244 --> 05:27.410
(chuckles nervously)
Ed's a prepper.

05:27.412 --> 05:29.779
And that word is "smart."

05:29.781 --> 05:32.348
And "rational."
T-There's<i> two</i> words.

05:32.350 --> 05:34.350
What do you got
in that shelter now, Ed,

05:34.352 --> 05:36.752
besides hand grenades
and Scotch?

05:36.754 --> 05:40.722
A Bible and a Koran.
A Koran?

05:40.724 --> 05:43.757
Yeah. I'm not quite sure which
way this thing is gonna go.

05:44.793 --> 05:45.758
Seriously?

05:45.760 --> 05:47.092
Ed is
one of those crazies

05:47.094 --> 05:48.526
who has a secret bunker
up in the mountains?

05:48.528 --> 05:50.394
Your mom and I have one
up in the mountains.

05:50.396 --> 05:51.962
You do? Where?

05:51.964 --> 05:54.197
Nice try.

05:57.302 --> 05:59.535
And done.

05:59.537 --> 06:01.803
I just bought our movie tickets
online.

06:01.805 --> 06:03.304
Isn't it great
that we can do that now?

06:03.306 --> 06:06.874
-We're like the Jetsons.
-That's great, mom.

06:06.876 --> 06:08.909
After the movie, we can
go to dinner and talk about it.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.478
That's great, Mom.

06:11.480 --> 06:14.314
(mockingly) "That's great, Mom.
That's great, Mom."

06:15.283 --> 06:17.950
Nothing Mom says is great.
Stop acting so suspicious.

06:17.952 --> 06:20.953
I'm sorry. It's just that every
time she mentions the movie,

06:20.955 --> 06:22.387
I'm afraid I'll slip
and blurt out

06:22.389 --> 06:24.088
that Ryan Gosling's girlfriend
is the killer.

06:24.090 --> 06:26.056
Wait -- what?

06:26.058 --> 06:27.891
Yes. (sighs)
I saw the movie.

06:27.893 --> 06:30.126
No -- His girlfriend's
the killer?

06:31.162 --> 06:33.128
That makes
total sense now.

06:33.130 --> 06:34.963
Wait --
You saw the movie?

06:34.965 --> 06:36.431
Yeah. Didn't<i> you?</i>

06:36.433 --> 06:39.300
I<i> thought</i> I did.

06:39.302 --> 06:41.602
We're horrible daughters.
What should we do?

06:41.604 --> 06:43.470
I mean, I guess we could
tell her that we saw the movie

06:43.472 --> 06:45.238
but we're still happy
to go with her.

06:45.240 --> 06:47.139
No, going to a movie with
someone who's already seen it

06:47.141 --> 06:48.473
is like sitting
in the back of a car

06:48.475 --> 06:49.774
while the people in front
make out.

06:49.776 --> 06:51.075
Okay, would you please
let that go?

06:51.077 --> 06:53.544
Kyle and I forgot
you were there.

06:54.613 --> 06:56.479
Hey. What are you doing home
so early?

06:56.481 --> 06:58.047
I live here.

06:59.150 --> 07:01.850
Why don't you tell your boyfriend
to leave out the bedroom window?

07:01.852 --> 07:04.686
I know, I know. You want to be
here for when Boyd gets home.

07:04.688 --> 07:05.920
I think it's nice,
honey.

07:05.922 --> 07:07.788
Well, I wasn't
shooting for "nice,"

07:07.790 --> 07:10.023
but sometimes it just happens,
you know, by accident.

07:10.025 --> 07:11.024
(knock on door)

07:11.026 --> 07:12.125
CHUCK: Baxter!

07:12.127 --> 07:13.960
Oh.

07:13.962 --> 07:15.161
Hey, Chuck.
Come on in.

07:15.163 --> 07:16.629
Hey. Hey.
Hey.

07:16.631 --> 07:18.197
Hey, well,
just so you guys know,

07:18.199 --> 07:19.798
a couple of my customers
reported

07:19.800 --> 07:22.033
some suspicious activity
down at Clark elementary.

07:22.035 --> 07:24.001
What are you talking about?
What happened?

07:24.003 --> 07:26.169
Some weird guy lurking around.
It's okay. We -- We got him.

07:26.171 --> 07:28.771
You call the cops? Well, I
figured that was up to<i> you.</i>

07:28.773 --> 07:30.205
Why's it up to<i> us?</i>

07:31.374 --> 07:32.439
(chuckles)

07:33.842 --> 07:36.142
I could've just had him
walk up with me,

07:36.144 --> 07:37.910
but this was
way more fun.

07:44.617 --> 07:46.950
This is unbelievable. So, when
you told Boyd to avoid creeps,

07:46.952 --> 07:48.217
you were talking about
yourself.

07:49.320 --> 07:50.852
I was not
being creepy.

07:50.854 --> 07:52.887
Except for hiding in the bushes.
Yeah, what's that?

07:52.889 --> 07:55.389
No, I wasn't hiding
in the bushes, okay?

07:55.391 --> 07:56.790
I was...

07:56.792 --> 07:59.459
nestling
in the branches.

07:59.461 --> 08:01.828
Branch nestling.

08:01.830 --> 08:03.396
Not cool.

08:03.398 --> 08:05.564
Mom, we better leave
if you want to have time

08:05.566 --> 08:07.365
to look at the snacks
for 10 minutes

08:07.367 --> 08:09.066
and say,
"Eh, I probably shouldn't,

08:09.068 --> 08:11.001
but I did work out
this week."

08:11.003 --> 08:13.736
Yeah, we don't want to miss the
beginning of the movie, right?

08:14.739 --> 08:17.206
Meh.
(chuckles)

08:17.208 --> 08:18.574
Let me
get this straight.

08:18.576 --> 08:20.509
When you said
he could walk home from school,

08:20.511 --> 08:22.577
you were planning all along
to follow him home in the car.

08:22.579 --> 08:24.211
I was not planning on it,
okay?

08:24.213 --> 08:26.079
I was driving here,
and then I passed the school,

08:26.081 --> 08:28.147
and I saw the bush.

08:29.316 --> 08:32.984
So, you know,
I-I took it as a sign.

08:32.986 --> 08:34.685
So, you only
listen to God

08:34.687 --> 08:36.753
when he tells you
to do something stupid?

08:36.755 --> 08:38.521
Yeah, you know what?
This has been really fun,

08:38.523 --> 08:39.989
but I'm gonna go
pick up Boyd.

08:39.991 --> 08:41.991
All right,
but if I get another complaint,

08:41.993 --> 08:43.659
I'm using the Taser.

08:43.661 --> 08:45.927
But you know what? That might be fun.
Go ahead, man.

08:45.929 --> 08:48.029
Come on. No, wait a minute.
You're not going anywhere.

08:48.031 --> 08:49.196
Sit here and relax.

08:49.198 --> 08:51.064
We'll wait
for Boyd to come home.

08:51.066 --> 08:54.901
Why don't you stick around?
I might need to use that Taser.

08:59.207 --> 09:01.941
All right, good job getting this
set up so fast, Kyle.

09:01.943 --> 09:03.242
Oh, thank you, sir.
Yeah.

09:03.244 --> 09:06.044
All right, we're gonna
open it up with Q&A.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.779
To make sure
I get the right Q's,

09:07.781 --> 09:09.447
I want you
to read from these.

09:09.449 --> 09:10.514
Got it. All right.

09:10.516 --> 09:11.681
Good, good, good.

09:11.683 --> 09:13.516
Did you write these
left-handed?

09:15.553 --> 09:16.752
I was in a hurry.

09:16.754 --> 09:19.254
-Okay.
-Let's do this now.

09:19.256 --> 09:21.189
(clears throat) Thank you, folks.
Thanks for coming.

09:21.191 --> 09:22.456
Thank you.
Thank you.

09:22.458 --> 09:25.292
Okay, please, uh,
silence your cellphones.

09:25.294 --> 09:27.927
But if one goes off, it's not
the end of the world, so...

09:28.863 --> 09:30.629
Let's open it up
to some questions now.

09:30.631 --> 09:32.731
Uh...
y-young man in the back.

09:32.733 --> 09:34.966
Ah, yes, uh, thank you, sir.
Yeah. mm-hmm.

09:34.968 --> 09:38.702
Uh, maybe I'm just
an old-fashioned skee pig.

09:38.704 --> 09:39.969
(chuckles)

09:39.971 --> 09:42.805
Um, I-I think
you mean "skeptic."

09:42.807 --> 09:44.406
Yes?
Yes.

09:44.408 --> 09:46.074
Yes. All right.
g-go on, go on. Go ahead.

09:46.076 --> 09:49.110
But is the world really
as scary as you believe?

09:49.112 --> 09:50.911
(chuckling) No.
No, no, no, no.

09:50.913 --> 09:52.112
It's scarier.

09:52.114 --> 09:53.880
That's right.

09:53.882 --> 09:56.148
There are -- There are
many apocalyptic versions

09:56.150 --> 09:57.549
of the end of the world
here.

09:57.551 --> 09:59.284
You know,
there are airborne diseases.

09:59.286 --> 10:01.419
All right, there's invasion from
another country, outer space.

10:01.421 --> 10:03.154
Oh, you mean
like space aliens?

10:03.156 --> 10:04.788
No, like the sun.

10:05.323 --> 10:08.590
It emits solar flares,
and if one ever hits the Earth,

10:08.592 --> 10:10.124
it would cut out
all communications.

10:10.126 --> 10:11.592
What can we do
to stop it?

10:11.594 --> 10:12.859
Nothing.

10:14.495 --> 10:17.295
But we can prepare,
all right?

10:17.297 --> 10:18.896
So, g-go on, go on.
Go on.

10:18.898 --> 10:21.832
Okay, uh, what do we
need to know about

10:21.834 --> 10:25.468
the...Yellowstone
supervolcano?

10:25.470 --> 10:27.603
(chuckles) Well, you all know
that most of Wyoming

10:27.605 --> 10:29.438
is a colossal
volcanic crater.

10:29.440 --> 10:31.973
But my grandma just booked
a bus trip to Yellowstone.

10:31.975 --> 10:34.141
Easy. Easy, son.
Easy, easy.

10:34.143 --> 10:35.575
Easy, son.
(chuckles)

10:35.577 --> 10:38.844
The volcano last erupted
174,000 years ago, so...

10:38.846 --> 10:41.079
Well,
that means it's due.

10:41.081 --> 10:43.815
Well, possibly, possibly.
The, uh -- last summer,

10:43.817 --> 10:46.317
the ground temperature
in Yellowstone got so hot

10:46.319 --> 10:47.918
that the roads
started to melt.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.020
And my grandma
wears crocs.

10:50.655 --> 10:52.621
Okay, I'm not getting
a signal.

10:52.623 --> 10:54.155
It's a solar flare!

10:54.157 --> 10:55.456
All right,
I'm coming, grandma!

10:55.458 --> 10:56.924
Don't listen --

10:56.926 --> 10:59.326
okay, uh, folks,
just -- just re-- just relax.

11:01.797 --> 11:04.964
Okay, it's 2:45 now,
school's just letting out,

11:04.966 --> 11:07.132
so he needs two, three minutes
to gather his stuff,

11:07.134 --> 11:08.500
seven-minute walk home,

11:08.502 --> 11:12.170
so he should be home
between 2:54 and 2:56.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.704
Yeah,
that's probably right.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.872
8-year-old with
a first taste of freedom.

11:15.874 --> 11:18.541
I'm sure
he'll come straight home.

11:19.844 --> 11:22.444
Your kid's walking home
from elementary school,

11:22.446 --> 11:25.079
not crossing out of
the Green Zone in Baghdad.

11:26.282 --> 11:28.715
It's just parents today. They can't
leave the kids out of their sight.

11:28.717 --> 11:31.517
Ugh. When I was a kid,
we'd leave home in the morning,

11:31.519 --> 11:33.218
wouldn't come back
till dinner.

11:33.220 --> 11:35.119
My dad said, "Stay out
till the streetlights come on,"

11:35.121 --> 11:37.688
and we lived in a neighborhood
that did not have streetlights.

11:37.690 --> 11:39.990
Yeah, next thing
you're gonna tell me

11:39.992 --> 11:41.558
is you didn't wear
sunscreen.

11:41.560 --> 11:43.293
No, no, no,
we had sunscreen,

11:43.295 --> 11:45.561
but we used to put it
between two oreos

11:45.563 --> 11:47.629
and feed it
to our little brother.

11:47.631 --> 11:50.164
We coated my little brother's
head with peanut butter.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.432
Then we realized
he had a bad peanut allergy.

11:54.669 --> 11:56.402
What are you
looking at?

11:56.404 --> 11:58.137
Oh, nothing.

11:58.139 --> 12:00.806
I'm just, uh, I'm checking
my, uh, fantasy...athletes.

12:01.975 --> 12:04.375
-Are you, now?
-Can I have my phone, please?

12:04.377 --> 12:06.677
What's the blinking-dot
athlete? Who is that athlete?

12:06.679 --> 12:09.379
You put a GPS
on your kid.

12:09.381 --> 12:11.581
I attached it
to his clothing, yes.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.149
(laughs)

12:13.151 --> 12:15.417
Why don't you just chip him
like a little puppy?

12:15.419 --> 12:16.651
Okay, fine.
You know what?

12:16.653 --> 12:17.885
Maybe I'm not as brave
as you guys,

12:17.887 --> 12:19.219
but at least
I know where my son is.

12:19.221 --> 12:20.987
Mm.
Yeah.

12:20.989 --> 12:22.655
You should be happy. He's
heading out of school.  Yep.

12:22.657 --> 12:24.390
Just like you said,
but he's, uh...

12:24.392 --> 12:26.992
going towards Cherry Street,
which is...

12:26.994 --> 12:28.059
That -- That's
the wrong way.

12:28.061 --> 12:29.827
Yeah, well, he's probably,

12:29.829 --> 12:33.163
you know, talking to a girl
or chasing a butterfly.

12:33.165 --> 12:35.899
At 35 miles an hour?

12:35.901 --> 12:37.333
He's not that fast.

12:37.335 --> 12:38.567
Little problem,
actually.

12:38.569 --> 12:39.768
I'll drive.

12:39.770 --> 12:41.468
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on.

12:44.439 --> 12:46.738
I made it!

12:49.509 --> 12:50.941
Hello?

12:56.514 --> 12:57.713
I knew this
was gonna happen.

12:57.715 --> 12:59.114
Listen, get a grip,
all right?

12:59.116 --> 13:00.882
There's a perfectly
good explanation for this.

13:00.884 --> 13:03.351
Yeah, he's been kidnapped!
You know, I bet you it's ISIS.

13:03.353 --> 13:04.852
They want recruits,

13:04.854 --> 13:07.087
and they've seen how good
he is on the monkey bars.

13:07.089 --> 13:10.123
Listen, stop panicking,
or I'm gonna have to slap you,

13:10.125 --> 13:11.858
and I don't think
I'll be able to stop!

13:11.860 --> 13:15.294
Can we please
just be going faster?

13:15.296 --> 13:17.229
He's got a point,
Mr. Flintstone.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.431
Make with the feet.

13:19.433 --> 13:21.266
You just keep your eyes
on that GPS, Baxter.

13:21.268 --> 13:22.734
The police
are on their way.

13:22.736 --> 13:25.103
Listen, if -- if I got it right,
he's in, um...

13:25.105 --> 13:26.804
That van right there.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.372
Oh, my God!
He's in a van?!

13:28.374 --> 13:30.307
(siren wailing)
Here come the cops.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.375
Shoot the tires!
Shoot the driver!

13:32.377 --> 13:33.876
Just start shooting!

13:33.878 --> 13:36.078
Or they could start shooting
that bumper sticker

13:36.080 --> 13:40.081
that says "My child is an honor
student at Clark Elementary"!

13:40.083 --> 13:41.348
What?

13:42.384 --> 13:44.050
Ohhh.
(siren chirps)

13:44.052 --> 13:45.985
Oh, is that
the Gundersons' van?

13:45.987 --> 13:49.788
Mm. We'll know in a second.
The cops are pulling them over.

13:49.790 --> 13:51.823
(chuckles)

13:51.825 --> 13:53.958
Hey, Jeffrey.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.428
(chuckles) Jeffrey's mom is
now facedown on the asphalt.

13:57.430 --> 14:01.098
A nice,
middle-aged white lady.

14:01.100 --> 14:03.066
You don't see that
every day.

14:08.072 --> 14:10.172
I'm so excited
to see this!

14:10.174 --> 14:11.806
Hey, do you think
he takes his shirt off?

14:11.808 --> 14:12.973
Twice.
What?

14:12.975 --> 14:14.641
Probably.
I mean, I don't know.

14:14.643 --> 14:16.476
Geez, Mom,
keep it in your pants.

14:18.346 --> 14:20.279
Oh, I wonder if I have time
to go to the snack bar.

14:20.281 --> 14:22.914
I mean, I really shouldn't, but
I did work out this week, so...

14:22.916 --> 14:26.017
Go ahead. Nothing much happens
in the first 20 minutes anyway.

14:26.019 --> 14:28.786
What? I mean, of any movie.
Everybody knows that.

14:28.788 --> 14:30.754
Hey, did you ever buy
that mayonnaise?

14:30.756 --> 14:32.455
What -- What --
What's going on, Mandy?

14:32.457 --> 14:34.089
Uhhhh...

14:34.091 --> 14:35.657
Eve saw the movie.

14:35.659 --> 14:36.758
Eve!

14:36.760 --> 14:38.793
Oh.
Uh, s-so did Mandy.

14:38.795 --> 14:39.627
Mandy!

14:39.629 --> 14:41.161
So did Eve!

14:41.163 --> 14:43.496
Well,
why'd you guys do that?

14:43.498 --> 14:45.865
Mom, so we saw the movie.
What's the big deal?

14:45.867 --> 14:47.366
Well, I'll tell you
what the big deal is.

14:47.368 --> 14:48.533
I-I just --
It's starting.

14:48.535 --> 14:49.934
(sighs)

14:52.872 --> 14:55.672
It's a big deal because
this was our last tradition.

14:55.674 --> 14:57.206
(sighs)

14:57.208 --> 14:59.641
We don't have tea parties
or go on bike rides

14:59.643 --> 15:02.310
or do any of that stuff
anymore.

15:02.312 --> 15:03.944
This -- this was
the one thing we had left,

15:03.946 --> 15:05.679
and you guys, you couldn't
respect that enough to wait?

15:05.681 --> 15:08.181
-WOMAN: Shh!
-I'm parenting!

15:09.317 --> 15:12.017
Now we -- we don't have the fun
of experiencing this together.

15:12.019 --> 15:14.352
It's -- It's like you guys
are just doing me a favor.

15:14.354 --> 15:16.520
It's not a favor.
We knew you wanted to see it,

15:16.522 --> 15:18.021
and we wanted to
be with you.

15:18.023 --> 15:19.389
WOMAN:
Be with her somewhere else!

15:19.391 --> 15:22.725
Just eat your popcorn!

15:22.727 --> 15:25.861
I just...I really love
spending time with you girls.

15:25.863 --> 15:28.330
We love spending time
with you, too, Mom.

15:28.332 --> 15:29.698
I hope so.

15:29.700 --> 15:31.399
I hope you guys
always feel that way.

15:31.401 --> 15:33.467
Of course we will.

15:33.469 --> 15:35.535
I don't know
if you've figured this out yet,

15:35.537 --> 15:37.236
but we love you.

15:37.238 --> 15:38.337
You guys.

15:38.339 --> 15:40.539
(both chuckle)
Hey!

15:40.541 --> 15:42.207
Wha-- hey!
Who threw that at my mom?

15:42.209 --> 15:44.175
You know what?
Let's just go get some dinner.

15:44.177 --> 15:46.177
We'll tell you what happens
in the movie. Please?

15:46.179 --> 15:47.745
Okay, yeah.
Let's go. Let's go. Okay.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.147
Okay. All right. Fine.

15:50.149 --> 15:51.248
Yeah.

15:51.250 --> 15:52.849
Enjoy your movie.

15:52.851 --> 15:55.884
The girlfriend is
the killer.

15:57.153 --> 15:58.552
How did you know that?

15:59.521 --> 16:00.920
(scoffs)
Never mind. Just...

16:05.158 --> 16:06.590
(video game beeping)

16:06.592 --> 16:08.425
He's here.

16:08.427 --> 16:11.060
Where were you guys?
I was worried about you.

16:11.062 --> 16:12.327
(sighs)

16:12.329 --> 16:14.862
I love you so much.

16:14.864 --> 16:16.463
O-kay.

16:17.732 --> 16:19.932
Look, we were chasing after
the kid who had<i> this.</i>

16:19.934 --> 16:21.833
You traded your jacket
for a skateboard?

16:21.835 --> 16:23.501
Yeah -- with Jeffrey.

16:23.503 --> 16:25.202
How did you know?

16:25.204 --> 16:27.537
'Cause Jeffrey's mom
was screaming about it

16:27.539 --> 16:29.305
from the back
of a patrol car.

16:31.008 --> 16:32.407
Go get the rest of your stuff,
all right?

16:32.409 --> 16:33.808
We're gonna go home.

16:34.877 --> 16:37.310
(sighs)
I am such an idiot.

16:40.948 --> 16:42.781
If you're waiting
for me to disagree,

16:42.783 --> 16:44.249
it's gonna be
a long night.

16:44.851 --> 16:46.851
Hey,
don't beat yourself up.

16:46.853 --> 16:48.686
You know what, actually?
I would like to beat<i> you</i> up.

16:48.688 --> 16:49.887
Wow, you want
to shoot the Gundersons,

16:49.889 --> 16:50.921
you want to beat me up.

16:50.923 --> 16:52.722
What,
did you have meat today?

16:52.724 --> 16:54.590
None of this would've happened
if you hadn't convinced me

16:54.592 --> 16:56.091
to let Boyd walk home alone.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:56.093 --> 16:57.525
Let's remember something --
nothing happened.

16:57.527 --> 16:58.792
Nothing happened this time.

16:58.794 --> 17:00.426
You can't live your life
in fear like this.

17:00.428 --> 17:01.794
Watch me.
I'm sorry, Mike,

17:01.796 --> 17:03.462
but when we were
chasing that van,

17:03.464 --> 17:05.197
the only thing
I could think about

17:05.199 --> 17:07.199
was every scary story
I've ever seen on the news.

17:07.201 --> 17:08.934
Because that's
what the news does!

17:08.936 --> 17:11.603
It's their job to scare you --
disease, disaster, violence.

17:11.605 --> 17:14.372
They make everybody think we're
living on one big cruise ship.

17:14.374 --> 17:16.774
So you're gonna tell me
that you were 100% sure

17:16.776 --> 17:18.375
that Boyd was safe
the whole time?

17:18.377 --> 17:20.110
No,
I'm not gonna say that,

17:20.112 --> 17:21.911
but the scared part of me
had to be quiet

17:21.913 --> 17:24.079
so the other part of me could
figure out what to do about it.

17:24.081 --> 17:27.048
Well, you know what? I guess the
scared part of me is just too loud.

17:27.050 --> 17:29.417
Look, I know the news media is
supposed to manipulate my emotions,

17:29.419 --> 17:31.118
but guess what --
it works.

17:31.120 --> 17:34.087
Boyd is done
walking home alone from school.

17:34.089 --> 17:35.987
Well, we're gonna start
eating whale!

17:37.790 --> 17:39.856
(keyboard clacking)

17:40.992 --> 17:43.225
Hey, Mike Baxter
for Outdoor Man here

17:43.227 --> 17:44.659
to talk about scare tactics.

17:44.661 --> 17:45.826
Sadly, they work.

17:45.828 --> 17:47.627
I'm just enjoying
some mixed nut--

17:47.629 --> 17:49.929
Oh.

17:49.931 --> 17:52.231
You see, the part of the brain
that triggers fear

17:52.233 --> 17:54.766
works faster than the part
that controls reason.

17:54.768 --> 17:57.068
For some people -- little kids
who are afraid of the dark

17:57.070 --> 17:58.669
and certain son-in-laws
who are afraid of...

17:58.671 --> 18:00.303
well, just about everything,

18:00.305 --> 18:03.606
the reason part of the brain
never really kicks in.

18:03.608 --> 18:05.908
As a contrast,
animals don't have reason.

18:05.910 --> 18:08.810
That's why the stupid coyote
always ends up in midair

18:08.812 --> 18:10.444
holding that stick of dynamite.

18:10.446 --> 18:12.479
(cries mockingly)

18:12.481 --> 18:14.914
And that's why my dog panics
every time the doorbell rings.

18:14.916 --> 18:16.682
He goes nuts,
and I try to explain to him,

18:16.684 --> 18:19.618
"Listen, burglars
don't ring the doorbell."

18:19.620 --> 18:21.686
And you just get that look
from the dog.

18:23.489 --> 18:25.021
Human beings are blessed
with reason.

18:25.023 --> 18:26.655
But it's harder to use it

18:26.657 --> 18:29.324
when the media bombards you
with terrifying images --

18:29.326 --> 18:33.660
tsunamis, plane crashes,
the new Colonel Sanders.

18:33.662 --> 18:36.496
That's why I'm declaring
Outdoor Man a fear-free zone,

18:36.498 --> 18:37.930
because we don't sell fear.

18:37.932 --> 18:39.331
We sell courage,

18:39.333 --> 18:42.033
we sell engagement
between man and nature

18:42.035 --> 18:44.335
in the form of kayaks,
climbing gear,

18:44.337 --> 18:46.870
and -- on sale this month --
casting rods.

18:46.872 --> 18:49.973
You see, the world is kind of
the opposite of Hillary Clinton.

18:49.975 --> 18:53.509
It actually gets<i> less</i> scary
the better you know it.

18:53.511 --> 18:54.776
I'll leave you with a quote.

18:54.778 --> 18:56.511
"Fearless is not
the absence of fear.

18:56.513 --> 18:58.513
Fearless is living
in spite of those things

18:58.515 --> 18:59.847
that scare you to death."

18:59.849 --> 19:01.882
And what great philosopher
said that?

19:01.884 --> 19:03.016
Aristotle?

19:03.018 --> 19:04.517
Schopenhauer?

19:04.519 --> 19:05.684
Descartes?

19:05.686 --> 19:08.520
No, it -- it was Taylor Swift.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.089
If that ain't scary,
I don't know what is.

19:13.893 --> 19:15.959
Come on, everybody.
Seminar's about ready to begin.

19:15.961 --> 19:17.393
You guys sit here.

19:17.395 --> 19:19.161
Plenty of stuff for the kids
to play with outside.

19:19.163 --> 19:21.062
Yeah, we got a bunch
of cool trampolines

19:21.064 --> 19:22.997
that are all like,
"Fong! Fong! Fong! Fong!"

19:22.999 --> 19:26.533
And these slacklines
that are like, "Whoa!"

19:26.535 --> 19:28.701
So, who wants to play?
Come on.

19:28.703 --> 19:31.870
So, while your kids are
out there playing,

19:31.872 --> 19:34.172
you'll be in here learning about
how not to be afraid

19:34.174 --> 19:36.374
of them out there playing.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.876
Mike, we could've made
a lot of money

19:38.878 --> 19:40.310
on that prepper stuff,
Mike.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.711
But I like this.

19:41.713 --> 19:43.813
It's a good thing we're doing
for the kids.

19:44.816 --> 19:46.282
Not really doing it
for the kids.

19:47.184 --> 19:48.183
Right.

19:48.185 --> 19:49.450
Hi.
Hey.

19:50.486 --> 19:51.885
Is, uh, there supervision
out there?

19:51.887 --> 19:53.753
Kyle's out there,
so no.

19:55.857 --> 19:57.690
You sure you want
to go through with this?

19:57.692 --> 19:59.658
Nope. Not really.

19:59.660 --> 20:01.526
But someone
I admire very much

20:01.528 --> 20:03.094
explained to me
what "fearless" means.

20:03.096 --> 20:04.662
You watched the vlog.

20:04.664 --> 20:06.196
No.

20:06.198 --> 20:08.865
I got that one
from Taylor Swift.

20:08.867 --> 20:10.933
(crash)

20:10.935 --> 20:14.235
It's okay.
Only me.

20:16.739 --> 20:18.472
Water cannon misfire.

20:27.215 --> 20:29.615
Hey, Kyle.
Hey.

20:29.617 --> 20:32.451
The kids had a super-great time
playing outside today.

20:32.453 --> 20:34.186
(chuckling) Yeah.
What about that kid

20:34.188 --> 20:35.921
that almost started crying
when we said

20:35.923 --> 20:37.055
it was all over?
Yeah.

20:37.057 --> 20:38.289
You okay?

20:38.291 --> 20:39.857
Yeah.

20:39.859 --> 20:42.359
I was just
really having fun.

20:42.361 --> 20:43.360
Mr. Alzate's seminar
was good, too.

20:43.362 --> 20:44.961
I think so.
Yeah.

20:44.963 --> 20:48.364
In fact, I might do
one of those secret shelters.

20:48.366 --> 20:49.765
What?
Build it yourself?

20:49.767 --> 20:51.900
I mean, you're not
that handy with tools

20:51.902 --> 20:53.968
after the incident
with the needle-nose pliers.

20:53.970 --> 20:57.071
Not my fault. Okay, if that's not
how you're supposed to use them,

20:57.073 --> 20:59.073
then don't put the word "nose"
in the name.

20:59.075 --> 21:00.874
Besides, I'm not
gonna build it myself.

21:00.876 --> 21:02.041
I'll hire people.

21:02.043 --> 21:03.442
Of course
you'll hire people.

21:03.444 --> 21:05.444
Now, you got a group
of electricians, carpenters,

21:05.446 --> 21:08.113
and plumbers
helping you build it,

21:08.115 --> 21:09.714
and after you're finished,

21:09.716 --> 21:12.083
all you got to do
is kill them all.

21:12.085 --> 21:13.784
What? No.

21:13.786 --> 21:16.620
You have to, 'cause otherwise,
it wouldn't be secret, would it?

21:16.622 --> 21:18.154
Oh, you're right.
Yeah.

21:18.156 --> 21:19.588
Oh, man. The place will be
swarming with people.

21:19.590 --> 21:21.756
Exactly. Then where
am<i> I</i> supposed to go?

21:21.758 --> 21:23.824
Well, Vanessa and I
have a secret shelter.

21:23.826 --> 21:25.225
Oh, awesome.
Where is it?

21:25.227 --> 21:27.126
Nice try.
