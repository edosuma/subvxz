00:01.952 --> 00:03.702
<i>- Last year, a competition
was created</i>

00:03.746 --> 00:05.787
<i>to test the nation's
best bladesmiths.</i>

00:05.831 --> 00:08.165
<i>Thousands responded,
and this year,</i>

00:08.209 --> 00:10.125
<i>craftsmen from
all over the country</i>

00:10.169 --> 00:12.461
<i>and all walks of life
have come forward</i>

00:12.504 --> 00:14.213
<i>for their change
to claim the title.</i>

00:14.256 --> 00:15.797
- I'm going to be the next
"Forged in Fire" champion.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.132
- I want to win!

00:17.176 --> 00:18.383
- It would be
a life-changing moment.

00:18.427 --> 00:20.010
- Welcome to the Forge.

00:20.054 --> 00:22.638
<i>- Now the Forge returns
with challenges</i>

00:22.681 --> 00:25.140
<i>unlike anything
ever seen before.</i>

00:25.184 --> 00:27.309
- You'll be using this.

00:27.353 --> 00:30.145
<i>- Skill and ingenuity will be
pushed to the limit.</i>

00:30.189 --> 00:31.521
<i>Some will rise to the challenge.</i>

00:31.565 --> 00:34.149
- Whoa!
<i>- Some will fall.</i>

00:34.193 --> 00:35.734
<i>But only the best
will be crowned</i>

00:35.778 --> 00:37.486
<i>"Forged in Fire" champions</i>

00:37.529 --> 00:40.489
<i>and take home $10,000.</i>

00:49.208 --> 00:50.832
<i>- My name's Jeff Bridgers.</i>

00:50.876 --> 00:53.252
I've been making blades
for about eight years.

00:53.295 --> 00:54.836
<i>I'm mainly self-taught.</i>

00:54.880 --> 00:58.340
Being a bladesmith,
it's almost meditative.

00:58.384 --> 01:00.175
<i>I kind of get in tune
with all the things</i>

01:00.219 --> 01:01.551
<i>that I have to do.</i>

01:01.595 --> 01:03.470
<i>- My name's Kim Stahl.</i>

01:03.514 --> 01:05.347
<i>I love working with the fire.</i>

01:05.391 --> 01:07.683
I get a lot of my energy and
aggression pounding metal out.

01:07.726 --> 01:09.559
There's not a lot of
women that are doing this

01:09.603 --> 01:12.437
right now, so I'm definitely
competing for the female factor.

01:12.481 --> 01:14.398
- My name is Harry Harkins.

01:14.441 --> 01:16.692
I've been bladesmithing for
a little over four years now.

01:16.735 --> 01:18.527
<i>I learned bladesmithing
through my brother.</i>

01:18.570 --> 01:22.197
He helped me learn to forge
blades and to make knives.

01:22.241 --> 01:23.782
<i>- My name is Craig Cameron.</i>

01:23.826 --> 01:25.784
I started bladesmithing in 2000.

01:25.828 --> 01:28.203
<i>I've done fairly well,
and I've won a few awards.</i>

01:28.247 --> 01:29.538
I'm a very competitive person.

01:29.581 --> 01:31.248
I'm so competitive,

01:31.292 --> 01:34.876
I can't even play Monopoly
with my mother-in-law.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.086
- Good morning, bladesmiths.

01:36.130 --> 01:37.921
Welcome to the Forge.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.881
You are here to engage
in three rounds

01:39.925 --> 01:42.843
of competition designed
to test every aspect

01:42.886 --> 01:47.222
of your edged-weapon-making
capability, from design

01:47.266 --> 01:49.599
to forging to fit and finish.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.601
After each round,
you will hand your work

01:51.645 --> 01:53.437
over to our panel
of expert judges:

01:53.480 --> 01:57.232
American Bladesmith Society
mastersmith J. Neilson,

01:57.276 --> 02:00.610
historical weapons re-creation
specialist David Baker,

02:00.654 --> 02:04.114
edged and impact weapons
specialist, Doug Marcaida.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.408
They will decide which of you
will be the "Forged in Fire"

02:06.452 --> 02:11.621
champion and leave here
with a check for $10,000.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.248
In the crates in front of you,

02:13.292 --> 02:14.583
there are a variety of metals,

02:14.626 --> 02:18.295
some useful,
some not very useful.

02:18.339 --> 02:20.422
Your job is to choose a metal

02:20.466 --> 02:23.133
and forge a blade
of your own design,

02:23.177 --> 02:25.260
in your signature style.

02:25.304 --> 02:27.763
- Oh, man, I don't know enough
about materials

02:27.806 --> 02:30.265
<i>to decipher between tool steel
and mild steel.</i>

02:30.309 --> 02:32.476
It's just not in my wheelhouse.

02:32.519 --> 02:34.853
<i>- I've never dumpster
dived for steel before.</i>

02:34.897 --> 02:39.524
I use very, very high-quality
known steels with known...

02:39.568 --> 02:42.277
With known... everything's known
about 'em.

02:42.321 --> 02:44.613
<i>This is all new for me.</i>

02:44.656 --> 02:47.032
- You must turn
in a finished blade

02:47.076 --> 02:49.951
capable of advancing you
to round two

02:49.995 --> 02:51.912
that is fully hardened.

02:51.955 --> 02:54.122
The blades themselves must fall
within the following

02:54.166 --> 02:56.166
size parameters.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.460
<i>The length of the blade,
not including the tang,</i>

02:58.504 --> 03:01.463
<i>must be
between 10 and 14 inches.</i>

03:01.507 --> 03:03.467
<i>The overall length of the weapon</i>

03:03.509 --> 03:06.802
<i>must not exceed 22 inches.</i>

03:06.845 --> 03:08.303
Keep in mind,
in the second round,

03:08.347 --> 03:11.848
you will have to attach
a handle to that blade.

03:11.892 --> 03:16.895
Your blades will then be tested
in an ice chop and a rope slice.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.357
You will have 20 minutes

03:20.401 --> 03:22.317
to dumpster dive and work
on your designs.

03:22.361 --> 03:25.195
You will have three hours
to forge your blades.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.072
Your time starts now.

03:27.116 --> 03:30.075
<i>[rock music]</i>

03:30.119 --> 03:31.993
- I hope these guys
know what they're doing.

03:32.037 --> 03:33.829
<i>- Those hubcaps, bicycle wheels,</i>

03:33.872 --> 03:35.914
<i>and that sheet steel
are definitely not metals</i>

03:35.958 --> 03:37.999
<i>that can be hardened.</i>

03:38.043 --> 03:39.668
<i>- I like the bicycle wheel
myself.</i>

03:39.711 --> 03:41.628
[laughs]

03:41.672 --> 03:45.882
- So just by choosing the wrong
steel out of this scrap pile,

03:45.926 --> 03:48.051
a smith could put themselves
out of the competition.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.886
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>

03:49.930 --> 03:52.389
<i>- Which is the difficulty
of this first challenge,</i>

03:52.433 --> 03:54.891
knowing what your materials
come from.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.060
- Is there anything?
- Uh, no.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.687
- No?

03:58.730 --> 04:00.105
- Right or wrong,
I'm going with it.

04:00.149 --> 04:01.773
<i>I've grabbed an axle.</i>

04:01.817 --> 04:04.067
That's what I'm gonna
try to use.

04:04.111 --> 04:05.694
- Harry looks pretty confident.

04:05.737 --> 04:07.946
First piece of metal
he got, he liked it.

04:07.990 --> 04:10.991
<i>- I'm going to make
what I call a cowboy bowie.</i>

04:11.034 --> 04:13.535
<i>A cowboy bowie
will chop your firewood.</i>

04:13.579 --> 04:15.537
It'll cut the potatoes
for your cowboy stew.

04:15.581 --> 04:19.291
And you can get it so sharp
it'll cut your gizzard out.

04:19.334 --> 04:21.209
How long you going...
You going for 14 inches?

04:21.253 --> 04:22.919
- I'm going 13 1/2.

04:22.963 --> 04:25.130
Gonna leave me a little extra
in there.

04:25.174 --> 04:26.923
<i>I grab that wrecking bar.</i>

04:26.967 --> 04:28.717
<i>I'm pretty sure
it's a hardenable steel.</i>

04:28.760 --> 04:30.719
- There's nothing wrong
with the wrecking bar,

04:30.762 --> 04:33.096
but it's a little
on the softer side.

04:33.140 --> 04:35.807
<i>- I'd say my signature blade
would be the bowie knife.</i>

04:35.851 --> 04:37.767
<i>The weapon I'm making
is the Big B.</i>

04:37.811 --> 04:41.396
<i>The Big B
is a chopper-camp knife.</i>

04:41.440 --> 04:42.647
<i>It's the big bitch.</i>

04:42.691 --> 04:44.107
<i>It's a bitch to grind.</i>

04:44.151 --> 04:45.901
It's a bitch to forge.

04:45.944 --> 04:48.111
But in the end, it makes
a really bitchin' knife.

04:48.155 --> 04:51.907
That's what I'm gonna go with.

04:51.950 --> 04:54.075
<i>- I ended up picking a pry bar,</i>

04:54.119 --> 04:56.244
<i>looks like it's a grade 8 bolt.</i>

04:56.288 --> 04:58.955
I just know it's
a really hard piece of steel.

04:58.999 --> 05:04.753
- Jeff has a similar pike
to what Craig chose.

05:04.796 --> 05:07.255
- He should be okay with that.

05:07.299 --> 05:09.424
<i>- I'm gonna try to make a kukri.</i>

05:09.468 --> 05:11.676
<i>The challenge, you know,
of cutting through the rope,</i>

05:11.720 --> 05:13.595
<i>the curvature in the blade</i>

05:13.639 --> 05:16.264
it seemed like
a good blade for it.

05:16.308 --> 05:19.809
- I never do this.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.102
- Kim...

05:21.146 --> 05:22.604
- That's an interesting choice...

05:22.648 --> 05:24.147
- I don't know
if that's hardenable...

05:24.191 --> 05:25.774
- Is that a good steel
to be using?

05:25.817 --> 05:27.901
- I don't know
if it's a hardenable steel.

05:27.945 --> 05:29.194
<i>- I'm going to make something
similar to a chef's knife.</i>

05:29.238 --> 05:30.737
<i>That's my signature blade.</i>

05:30.781 --> 05:33.114
<i>I'm competing
for the female factor.</i>

05:33.158 --> 05:34.616
<i>It's hard to even find gloves
that fit our fingers</i>

05:34.660 --> 05:36.660
and our hand size.

05:36.703 --> 05:38.620
<i>That's something
that's hopefully gonna change</i>

05:38.664 --> 05:41.373
after a lot more women see this
and become passionate about it.

05:41.416 --> 05:42.958
[exhales]

05:43.001 --> 05:46.169
- Bladesmiths, your design
window is now closed.

05:46.213 --> 05:50.173
Your forging time starts now.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.591
- There we go.

05:51.635 --> 05:55.345
<i>[rock music]</i>

05:55.389 --> 05:57.138
<i>We got forges.
We got sparks.</i>

05:57.182 --> 06:00.475
<i>We got a torch going.
I'm liking this.</i>

06:00.519 --> 06:01.810
- All right,
Harry just took about

06:01.853 --> 06:03.812
a 6 1/2,
7-inch piece

06:03.855 --> 06:05.480
of that axle
and put it in the forge...

06:05.524 --> 06:08.191
- Right in the fire.
There you go.

06:08.235 --> 06:09.818
- It's getting hot.

06:09.861 --> 06:11.695
My brother can't be here,
so today with me,

06:11.738 --> 06:15.198
I brought my brother's apron
and my brother's gloves.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.866
This is my way
of picking him up.

06:16.910 --> 06:19.828
And we're gonna
celebrate this together.

06:19.871 --> 06:23.999
I've got a plan, and my plan is,
"Keep it simple, stupid."

06:24.042 --> 06:26.251
Coming through.
Hot metal.

06:26.295 --> 06:28.878
- Harry's our oldest smith
in the shop today,

06:28.922 --> 06:31.715
and he's moving
faster than anybody else.

06:31.758 --> 06:33.216
- I just hope I'm using
the right steel.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.594
That's all I can say.

06:35.637 --> 06:38.430
<i>I like to talk.
I like to help people.</i>

06:38.473 --> 06:39.848
Get 'er, man.

06:39.891 --> 06:41.349
We got this.
We got this.

06:41.393 --> 06:43.977
I'm just a very
extroverted person.

06:44.021 --> 06:45.854
Come on, attagirl.

06:45.897 --> 06:47.397
I'm having the time of my life.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.898
What're you doing, bubba?

06:48.942 --> 06:51.985
- No worries right now.

06:52.029 --> 06:53.778
- And Craig 's saying,
"To heck with it."

06:53.822 --> 06:56.031
He's just jammed that big rod
in the fire.

06:56.074 --> 06:58.867
- It's a lot of metal
to be carrying around.

06:58.910 --> 07:01.202
- I want to win the competition
for my son.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.371
<i>My boy watched the first
season, and he kept telling me,</i>

07:03.415 --> 07:05.040
<i>he said, "Dad,
you need to be on this show."</i>

07:05.083 --> 07:06.708
<i>So I just wanted to show him</i>

07:06.752 --> 07:08.752
that if there's something
you want to do,

07:08.795 --> 07:11.921
go out and do it.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.966
- Craig is showing a lot
of skill.

07:15.010 --> 07:16.259
- He's chugging right along.

07:16.303 --> 07:18.219
- I do like the metal I chose.

07:18.263 --> 07:19.679
I think it's got enough carbon.

07:19.723 --> 07:23.266
I think it's gonna
hold an edge real well.

07:23.310 --> 07:26.227
- So Craig's cutting
all that excess off now.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.911
- That was smart, though.
He had a handle.

07:27.939 --> 07:31.232
He just drew out what he needed.

07:31.276 --> 07:33.568
That was a good move.
- Bring 'er on, baby.

07:33.612 --> 07:35.945
- At least yours
is shaping up pretty nice.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.740
- It's cooling down quick.

07:38.784 --> 07:41.076
- The only one I've seen so far
that's working cold steel

07:41.119 --> 07:43.953
is Jeffrey.

07:43.997 --> 07:46.915
I'm worried that he's
prepping himself for failure.

07:46.958 --> 07:49.918
- That steel seemed
like it cooled down very quick.

07:49.961 --> 07:52.295
- Jeffrey's is starting to not
look like a kukri anymore.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.755
- Yeah, you've lost a lot

07:53.799 --> 07:56.049
of what he was going
for in the dimensions.

07:56.093 --> 07:58.927
- Based on the way
the metal was moving so slowly,

07:58.970 --> 08:02.847
<i>I decided to go with a
drop-point bowie knife instead.</i>

08:02.891 --> 08:04.224
Now we're cooking.

08:04.267 --> 08:07.227
<i>[rock music]</i>

08:07.270 --> 08:08.937
¶ ¶

08:08.980 --> 08:10.271
- Kim 's struggling
a little bit.

08:10.315 --> 08:11.815
- Yeah.

08:11.858 --> 08:13.650
- I feel, like, a little
nervous.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.527
I don't really know
what kind of metal I've got,

08:15.570 --> 08:18.780
and it's taking a while
for me to move it.

08:18.824 --> 08:21.783
I just need to get this metal
moved out as flat as I can.

08:21.827 --> 08:24.619
I feel like I'm not
getting it any flatter.

08:24.663 --> 08:27.288
Do you think I could just
use the rest of his?

08:27.332 --> 08:28.623
- Oh, and switch it up?

08:28.667 --> 08:31.710
- Yeah, scratch this one?

08:31.753 --> 08:33.753
- I don't know.

08:33.797 --> 08:36.673
- Oh, wait,
she's grabbing the wrecking bar.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.299
- Kim 's starting over.

08:38.343 --> 08:40.885
- Contestants can abandon
their original steel

08:40.929 --> 08:42.303
and start over.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.139
<i>- I grab scrap metal from Craig.</i>

08:44.182 --> 08:46.182
I'm switching materials.
I know I'm already behind.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.977
The original metal I was working
with set me back a whole lot.

08:49.020 --> 08:50.979
<i>Now I'm feeling really
flustered on how I can</i>

08:51.022 --> 08:52.355
make up this time.

08:55.318 --> 08:56.860
- I mean, you hate to see
one of the smiths

08:56.903 --> 08:58.987
have to go back to the dumpster,

08:59.030 --> 09:02.073
but it may also
be a very smart move.

09:02.117 --> 09:05.034
<i>- It would've been amazing
to start with that new metal,</i>

09:05.078 --> 09:08.037
but, you know, go with the flow.

09:08.081 --> 09:11.875
- Bladesmiths, you have
90 minutes remaining.

09:11.918 --> 09:16.880
- I'm sure you just amped up
Kim's stress level.

09:16.923 --> 09:21.050
- Hot metal!

09:21.094 --> 09:23.511
Just rock and roll, man.

09:23.555 --> 09:25.889
Attaboy!
Throw them sparks!

09:25.932 --> 09:28.892
- Throw 'em, baby. Throw 'em.
- Grind that thing, man.

09:28.935 --> 09:32.187
- Man, look at the sparks
that Craig is throwing.

09:32.230 --> 09:34.355
- It's like Fourth of July
over there.

09:34.399 --> 09:36.191
Craig is doing
exactly what I was hoping for.

09:36.234 --> 09:38.234
He's spreading out the back end
of that handle,

09:38.278 --> 09:39.861
so you're gonna have a good grip
on there.

09:39.905 --> 09:41.654
It's not gonna move
around at all.

09:41.698 --> 09:44.032
- It's time to move over
to the heat-treating process.

09:44.075 --> 09:46.117
<i>The heat-treating process
is the soul and the heart</i>

09:46.161 --> 09:49.370
<i>of the blade.</i>

09:49.414 --> 09:50.654
- Craig just went in the oil.

09:55.879 --> 09:57.545
<i>- I grab a file to check and see</i>

09:57.589 --> 09:59.172
<i>if the blade steel hardened.</i>

09:59.216 --> 10:00.715
Boy, I'm still getting
file bite on this.

10:00.759 --> 10:02.467
This ain't good.

10:02.511 --> 10:04.719
<i>The file teeth start biting
in my blade.</i>

10:04.763 --> 10:06.513
I know this blade isn't hard.

10:06.556 --> 10:08.473
<i>Well,
I'm gonna have to re-quench it.</i>

10:08.517 --> 10:10.809
I can warp it
or crack it very easily here.

10:10.852 --> 10:12.644
<i>If I don't get this right,</i>

10:12.687 --> 10:15.730
<i>everything I've done up
to this point means nothing.</i>

10:15.774 --> 10:17.315
- He goes in again.

10:24.241 --> 10:26.741
<i>[rock music]</i>

10:26.785 --> 10:28.243
- This ain't good.

10:28.286 --> 10:30.245
I know this blade isn't hard.

10:30.288 --> 10:31.955
<i>I'm gonna have to re-quench it.</i>

10:31.998 --> 10:34.123
<i>I can warp it
or crack it very easily here.</i>

10:34.167 --> 10:37.961
- He goes in again.

10:38.004 --> 10:41.965
- It went nice and straight
into the oil.

10:42.008 --> 10:45.093
- Hoo, I got her hard that time.

10:45.136 --> 10:47.929
- Look at Jeffrey's
marking his blade here.

10:47.973 --> 10:49.848
<i>- I know I'm gonna
have to put a handle on.</i>

10:49.891 --> 10:51.851
I'm marking the holes
in my blade

10:51.893 --> 10:54.936
so I can drill them
before I quench.

10:54.980 --> 10:56.896
- It's a good move.

10:56.940 --> 10:58.898
<i>- After you quench,
it's gonna be way too hard</i>

10:58.942 --> 11:00.608
to drill through
most of the time.

11:00.652 --> 11:03.903
- Bladesmiths, you have
30 minutes remaining.

11:03.947 --> 11:06.447
<i>[rock music]</i>

11:06.491 --> 11:08.283
- Kim looks like she just
wants to take that blade

11:08.326 --> 11:10.326
and chuck it against the wall.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.246
- I'm in a race
just to complete a piece

11:13.290 --> 11:15.790
to turn in to the judges.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.125
- Kim 's over to the grinder.

11:17.168 --> 11:19.085
- All right,
thank goodness for that.

11:19.129 --> 11:22.463
She can't afford
to waste any time.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.799
- I've never made a blade
in just three hours,

11:24.843 --> 11:26.718
so this is, like,
testing everything,

11:26.761 --> 11:29.387
where normally I have a lot
of time to make decisions.

11:29.431 --> 11:32.974
- She needs to take
a deep breath and move forward.

11:33.018 --> 11:34.976
- I like how Harry's
dipping his finger into the oil

11:35.020 --> 11:36.769
to check the temperature.

11:36.813 --> 11:38.773
<i>- Heat treating is so important,</i>

11:38.815 --> 11:41.357
because you can have the most
beautiful knife in the world,

11:41.401 --> 11:43.526
but if the heat
treat's not right on it,

11:43.570 --> 11:44.861
the knife is useless.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.529
Quenching.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.364
- So Harry's in the oil.
What did you think, J.?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.116
- I thought
it was still a little cool.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.493
I wasn't really happy
with the color of that blade.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.913
I would really like to see
Harry do a second quench.

11:54.956 --> 11:57.665
- As would I.

11:57.709 --> 12:02.462
- Bladesmiths,
you have five minutes remaining.

12:02.505 --> 12:03.838
- Oh, my goodness.
- That's gonna...

12:03.882 --> 12:05.256
That's gonna be very, very hot.

12:05.300 --> 12:06.507
Holy cow...
- Holy crap.

12:06.551 --> 12:07.508
Drop it, drop it, drop it...

12:07.552 --> 12:08.843
- Get your face out of there.

12:08.887 --> 12:09.844
- Drop it in there...
- Drop it in.

12:09.888 --> 12:11.054
Let go of it. Let go of it.

12:11.097 --> 12:12.847
- I'm leaning back.
- Whoo!

12:12.891 --> 12:14.390
- Whoo!

12:14.434 --> 12:18.353
- Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven!

12:18.396 --> 12:22.190
Six! Five! Four! Three!

12:22.233 --> 12:24.192
Two! One!

12:24.235 --> 12:26.903
Bladesmiths, stop your work!

12:26.947 --> 12:30.573
Please return to your anvils.

12:30.617 --> 12:33.326
<i>- I'm thinking, "Whoa,
Jeff, Harry, and Craig,</i>

12:33.370 --> 12:38.539
they definitely got a lot more
work done than I did."

12:38.583 --> 12:40.500
- Bladesmiths,
when you came here today,

12:40.543 --> 12:42.710
you were asked to forge a blade
of your own design

12:42.754 --> 12:44.212
in your signature style

12:44.255 --> 12:46.297
from one of these pieces
of scrap metal.

12:46.341 --> 12:49.384
You've each finished
a blade in three hours.

12:49.427 --> 12:51.552
Good job.

12:51.596 --> 12:54.764
Craig, please present
your blade to our judges.

12:54.808 --> 12:56.724
J?

12:56.768 --> 12:58.768
<i>- You got a little bit of curve
in the tang here,</i>

12:58.812 --> 13:01.771
<i>but that's pretty easy to fix.</i>

13:01.815 --> 13:03.481
I like the sweep of it.
Good job on that.

13:03.525 --> 13:05.984
- Thank you, thank you.
- Doug?

13:06.027 --> 13:07.360
- I love your design here.

13:07.404 --> 13:09.404
Definitely,
with the flaring there,

13:09.447 --> 13:12.824
it lends itself to be
a good chopper.

13:12.867 --> 13:14.492
Very nice.
- Thank you.

13:14.536 --> 13:17.745
- Harry, please present
your work.

13:17.789 --> 13:20.081
<i>- A lot of meat in the handle,
so there's still a ways</i>

13:20.125 --> 13:22.250
<i>to go
to get this down to weight.</i>

13:22.293 --> 13:23.751
<i>Just a bit concerned</i>

13:23.795 --> 13:26.963
if that heat treat
really hardened her up.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.589
- What do you think, Doug?

13:28.633 --> 13:30.466
- Nice design for a chopper,
Harry.

13:30.510 --> 13:32.635
<i>And there's nothing wrong
with rough around the edges.</i>

13:32.679 --> 13:34.303
It looks like it's gonna
function well.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.180
Good feel.
- Thank you.

13:36.224 --> 13:39.100
- Kim, please present
your blade.

13:39.144 --> 13:41.269
<i>- Well, it's a nice design
for cutting and chopping.</i>

13:41.312 --> 13:43.938
<i>It definitely has got
some rough aspects.</i>

13:43.982 --> 13:45.481
Got some wiggle in there.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.150
But it's still doable,
still workable.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.152
Thank you.
- Dave?

13:49.195 --> 13:51.529
- Well,
I loved your original design.

13:51.573 --> 13:53.948
Now, you didn't quite
draw this metal out far enough.

13:53.992 --> 13:56.117
But you definitely
started over again from stretch,

13:56.161 --> 13:58.286
and it's commendable that you
were able to turn a weapon

13:58.329 --> 13:59.537
in at all.

13:59.581 --> 14:00.830
- Thanks.

14:00.874 --> 14:05.668
- Jeff, please present
your blade.

14:05.712 --> 14:07.128
- It's got a nice shape.

14:07.172 --> 14:08.463
It's got a good feel
to it overall.

14:08.506 --> 14:10.465
Very good.

14:10.508 --> 14:12.633
- There's a lot of weight still
on the head of that blade.

14:12.677 --> 14:13.968
I mean, it'll help in the chop,

14:14.012 --> 14:15.344
but at the same time,
the second part

14:15.388 --> 14:17.013
of the challenge is a rope cut.

14:17.057 --> 14:20.516
Too much weight in that head
might set you back.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.060
- Well, bladesmiths,

14:22.103 --> 14:24.187
this will be a difficult
decision for our judges.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.439
Thank you.

14:26.483 --> 14:29.484
<i>[tense music]</i>

14:29.527 --> 14:31.152
- All right.
- That was a good time, man.

14:31.196 --> 14:33.529
- That was good. That was fun.
- That was a good time.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.156
- Nerve-racking.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.160
- All right, guys,
let's start with Craig's blade.

14:37.202 --> 14:39.160
How did he do overall, Doug?

14:39.204 --> 14:41.204
<i>- Well, the handle construction
I love.</i>

14:41.247 --> 14:43.164
<i>You can choke up
if you want control</i>

14:43.208 --> 14:46.417
or the length of that for
when you're doing the ice chop.

14:46.461 --> 14:48.878
Overall finish is beautiful.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.588
- Dave, what do you think?

14:50.632 --> 14:53.508
- Well, the way he
tapered the tang on the handle,

14:53.551 --> 14:55.551
you know, took all
that weight out here.

14:55.595 --> 14:59.722
I mean, it already
feels like a beautiful knife.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.182
- I hope the steel
was what I think it is

15:01.226 --> 15:03.101
and it holds up in heat treat.

15:03.144 --> 15:04.685
It's tough
when you don't know what it is.

15:04.729 --> 15:06.529
I mean, it could... anything can
happen there.

15:06.564 --> 15:08.147
- My heat treat
is my biggest fear.

15:08.191 --> 15:13.277
- All right, let's move
on to Harry's blade.

15:13.321 --> 15:16.197
<i>- It's got a good shape, but I
think the biggest issue is</i>

15:16.241 --> 15:18.741
whether or not this blade
is hardened enough.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.077
- Can we test that please?
- Oh, yeah.

15:21.121 --> 15:22.620
You can do a file check.

15:22.664 --> 15:24.372
If the steel's hard enough,

15:24.415 --> 15:26.707
the file won't even bite
into the edge of the blade.

15:26.751 --> 15:30.878
Ooh, how it's stopping...

15:30.922 --> 15:33.548
even the sound's saying
it's digging in.

15:33.591 --> 15:37.009
It's not properly hardened.

15:37.053 --> 15:38.511
- Okay, let's talk
about Kim's blade.

15:38.555 --> 15:40.930
<i>[tense music]</i>

15:40.974 --> 15:45.059
<i>- There is severe arc
in the tang.</i>

15:45.103 --> 15:48.062
She's got a lot
of grinding to do.

15:48.106 --> 15:50.106
- Oh, I'm definitely wondering
what they're saying.

15:50.150 --> 15:54.277
- Well, it is from her signature
style being a kitchen tool,

15:54.320 --> 15:56.779
and kitchen tools
are known to be chopping.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.781
The big question is, is this
the kind of kitchen tool

15:58.825 --> 16:02.451
that's gonna stand up to an ice
chop and then a rope cut?

16:02.495 --> 16:05.454
- All right, let's move
on to Jeff's blade there.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.248
<i>- A lot of work left to do.</i>

16:07.292 --> 16:09.542
<i>This pin hole,
it's really poorly placed.</i>

16:09.586 --> 16:11.919
<i>I mean, this is the junction
between the blade</i>

16:11.963 --> 16:13.171
and the handle right there,

16:13.214 --> 16:15.089
and that structural flaw
concerns me

16:15.133 --> 16:16.966
if this is gonna hold up
during a chop test.

16:17.010 --> 16:20.428
We've seen
that ice eat blades alive.

16:20.471 --> 16:23.097
- Dave?
- I'm with J. 100%.

16:23.141 --> 16:24.932
<i>Putting that hole right there,</i>

16:24.976 --> 16:26.976
it's almost building in
a failure point.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.812
<i>[tense music]</i>

16:29.856 --> 16:34.150
- Judges, is there one
of these blades

16:34.194 --> 16:37.528
that did not meet the parameters
of the challenge?

16:37.572 --> 16:38.863
- Yes.
- Yes.

16:38.907 --> 16:40.573
- Yes.

16:40.617 --> 16:42.617
- All right, judges,
let's go tell our bladesmiths.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.994
<i>[tense music]</i>

16:45.038 --> 16:48.915
Well, bladesmiths,
the decision has been made.

16:48.958 --> 16:50.666
¶ ¶

16:50.710 --> 16:53.836
And now it's time for one
of you to leave the Forge.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.298
¶ ¶

16:57.342 --> 16:59.926
Harry...

16:59.969 --> 17:02.970
your blade did not make the cut.

17:03.014 --> 17:05.139
- Harry, I know you thought
that metal was pretty hard,

17:05.183 --> 17:08.434
so you kind of hedged
your bets on the quench.

17:08.478 --> 17:10.978
<i>Well, we did a file test
on that knife,</i>

17:11.022 --> 17:15.107
<i>and that edge just isn't hard
enough to go forward.</i>

17:15.151 --> 17:16.609
Having said that, though,

17:16.653 --> 17:19.320
it was such a pleasure
to watch you work.

17:19.364 --> 17:20.988
Your energy was infectious.

17:21.032 --> 17:23.991
I mean, it literally spread
to all the other smiths.

17:24.035 --> 17:26.160
I just wish you'd gotten
that metal hot enough

17:26.204 --> 17:27.995
that it could've gone forward.

17:28.039 --> 17:29.664
But thank you, sir.

17:29.707 --> 17:31.249
- Thank you.

17:31.292 --> 17:33.542
- Harry, it's time
to surrender your weapon.

17:33.586 --> 17:36.504
<i>[tense music]</i>

17:36.547 --> 17:38.172
<i>- I'm a little disappointed,</i>

17:38.216 --> 17:42.009
but that's the way
things go in knife-making.

17:42.053 --> 17:44.637
<i>I came here to represent
me and my brother.</i>

17:44.681 --> 17:46.847
<i>He's not physically able
to compete in a challenge</i>

17:46.891 --> 17:50.726
like this, so I did the best
that I could to represent me

17:50.770 --> 17:52.395
<i>and him both.</i>

17:52.438 --> 17:54.939
<i>I hope that my brother
will be proud of me.</i>

17:54.983 --> 17:56.983
<i>[tense music]</i>

17:57.026 --> 17:59.235
- Welcome back to the Forge,
bladesmiths.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.404
In this round,
you will turn your blades

18:01.447 --> 18:05.199
into fully functioning weapons
by attaching a handle to them

18:05.243 --> 18:07.910
using the range
of materials provided to you.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.538
You have three hours
to complete this challenge.

18:10.581 --> 18:13.165
You can also use this time
to address any flaws or issues

18:13.209 --> 18:17.211
that the judges identified
with your blades earlier.

18:17.255 --> 18:18.879
After the three hours is up,

18:18.923 --> 18:23.592
we will test your blades
in an ice chop

18:23.636 --> 18:25.970
and a rope slice.

18:26.014 --> 18:28.306
Remember, after this round,

18:28.349 --> 18:31.058
one of you will have
to surrender your weapon

18:31.102 --> 18:32.518
and leave the Forge.

18:32.562 --> 18:33.853
<i>[tense music]</i>

18:33.896 --> 18:35.104
Good luck, bladesmiths.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.315
Your time starts now.

18:37.358 --> 18:40.568
<i>[rock music]</i>

18:40.611 --> 18:43.237
<i>- There's a small bend
in my tang,</i>

18:43.281 --> 18:46.365
so I straightaway just start
working on getting it flat.

18:46.409 --> 18:49.618
- What is she gonna have to do
to advance into the next round?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.746
- Personally, I 'd like
to see her lose the tang,

18:51.789 --> 18:53.748
or most of it... shave it down.

18:53.791 --> 18:55.958
- I almost feel
like you could get two hands

18:56.002 --> 18:57.752
on her tang right now.

18:57.795 --> 19:01.088
- I was thinking about the chop
and the rope cut.

19:01.132 --> 19:02.965
<i>It just didn't make sense
to have such a long tang</i>

19:03.009 --> 19:04.800
<i>on that knife.</i>

19:04.844 --> 19:06.344
- And there it goes.

19:06.387 --> 19:09.722
<i>[rock music]</i>

19:09.766 --> 19:11.932
<i>- I have a little bit
of a wobble in the blade.</i>

19:11.976 --> 19:14.769
<i>It kicks off to one side
just a little bit.</i>

19:14.812 --> 19:16.604
<i>So I want to get
that straightened up</i>

19:16.647 --> 19:18.439
<i>and get everything centered,</i>

19:18.483 --> 19:20.608
<i>so I've got a nice
symmetric blade.</i>

19:20.651 --> 19:24.362
<i>So the challenge is to chop a
block of ice and chop a rope.</i>

19:24.405 --> 19:26.280
¶ ¶

19:26.324 --> 19:28.284
<i>That bend, it creates more drag.</i>

19:28.326 --> 19:30.910
<i>So it could not cut the rope
if it's got that bend.</i>

19:30.953 --> 19:33.954
If I don't get this bend
out of mg blade, I'm screwed.

19:33.998 --> 19:35.289
¶ ¶

19:35.333 --> 19:38.084
<i>- I cut the two pieces
of micarta</i>

19:38.127 --> 19:40.461
to go on each side of the tang.

19:40.505 --> 19:44.799
I epoxy it with the pins, ,
and then I refine the shape

19:44.842 --> 19:47.593
until I meet up
with the metal and the tang.

19:47.637 --> 19:52.139
<i>I'm not a huge fan
of shiny, slippery handles.</i>

19:52.183 --> 19:53.891
The color of that micarta...

19:53.935 --> 19:56.477
It was a dark brown
with a little cherry in there...

19:56.521 --> 20:00.272
<i>I think it made my knife
have a classic edge to it.</i>

20:00.316 --> 20:02.024

20:02.068 --> 20:03.609
- Bladesmiths...

you have 90 minutes remaining.

20:07.240 --> 20:12.368
¶ ¶

20:12.412 --> 20:16.038
- I start to put my pins
down in my wood on one side

20:16.082 --> 20:17.998
and put my blade on top of it,

20:18.042 --> 20:22.169
<i>and they're starting
to not meet up correctly.</i>

20:22.213 --> 20:25.172
<i>I'm thinking,
"Just do it quickly."</i>

20:25.216 --> 20:27.007
- All right,
Kim is in panic mode.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.093
She needs to relax.

20:29.137 --> 20:31.345
If she keeps trying to force it,
she's got a good chance

20:31.389 --> 20:33.556
of breaking that handle material
and fracturing it.

20:33.599 --> 20:35.433
And Kim 's already
started over once.

20:35.476 --> 20:38.352
I don't think she wants
to do it a second time.

20:38.396 --> 20:39.895
- [bleep].

20:46.654 --> 20:49.280
<i>- The wood pieces for my handle
and my tang,</i>

20:49.323 --> 20:51.240
they're starting
to not meet up correctly.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.451

it, she's got a good chance

20:56.831 --> 20:59.457
<i>[tense music]</i>

20:59.500 --> 21:02.251

the worst job in history.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.420
That wood, if it's not
completely connected

21:04.464 --> 21:06.255
<i>with the tang, I mean,
it could fly off.</i>

21:06.299 --> 21:08.757
<i>So I put some extra glue
in there,</i>

21:08.801 --> 21:11.427
just to make sure it would
hold up to their tests.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.429
- How's it coming along?

21:13.473 --> 21:15.181
- Heh heh. I think it's okay.
- Good, good.

21:15.224 --> 21:16.807
- Yeah.

21:16.851 --> 21:18.434
<i>- Standing
at the handle material rack,</i>

21:18.478 --> 21:20.102
<i>I see this green
and black kirinite.</i>

21:20.146 --> 21:22.104
I'm stoked.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.898
<i>It's a real nice material.</i>

21:23.941 --> 21:25.983
I know it's gonna be perfect
for the zombie apocalypse

21:28.529 --> 21:30.237
<i>I'm shaping my handle,</i>

21:30.281 --> 21:32.448
and then I start rolling
the edges over on the handle

21:32.492 --> 21:33.782
to make it nice and smooth.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.785
<i>[rock music]</i>

21:36.829 --> 21:39.330
<i>I'm shaping. I'm grinding.
I'm rounding.</i>

21:39.373 --> 21:40.956
It's just total chaos.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.083
<i>If I get my material too hot,</i>

21:43.127 --> 21:46.295
I can actually ruin it and peel
it off and cause it to buckle

21:46.339 --> 21:48.797
<i>and actually try
to rip away from the tang.</i>

21:48.841 --> 21:51.675
That would be a huge setback
and cost me everything.

21:51.719 --> 21:53.427
<i>I could go home.</i>

21:53.471 --> 21:57.014
<i>[rock music]</i>

21:57.058 --> 21:59.016
- During the sharpening process,

21:59.060 --> 22:01.477
I was just experimenting
with the different stones.

22:01.521 --> 22:05.523
- Jeffrey's on a pretty
aggressive stone right there.

22:05.566 --> 22:07.983
<i>- They were a little small,
a little narrow.</i>

22:08.027 --> 22:09.818
I wasn't having much luck.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.321
I really had to do sections
of the blade.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.697
I didn't like that.

22:13.741 --> 22:15.741
- It seems like a lot of work.

22:15.785 --> 22:17.409
- That's why I like
sharpening on belts.

22:17.453 --> 22:20.913
It takes, like, two minutes.

22:20.957 --> 22:25.042
- Ten, nine, eight, seven,

22:25.086 --> 22:28.045
six, five, four,

22:28.089 --> 22:30.965
three, two, one.

<i>[tense music]</i>

22:35.972 --> 22:38.430

a different style of knife,

22:38.474 --> 22:40.391
so it's gonna be interesting
to see how everything

22:40.434 --> 22:44.520
stacks up in the test.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.772
- Bladesmiths,
we're at the ice chop now.

22:46.816 --> 22:49.108

22:50.653 --> 22:52.736
I'm gonna take
each of your blades

22:52.780 --> 22:56.532
and do seven vertical
chops into the ice.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.367

got a big smile on your face.

22:58.411 --> 23:00.494

nothing bent.

23:27.982 --> 23:29.565
It's a good grip.

23:29.609 --> 23:31.775
It did roll just a little bit.
- Did it? Yeah.

23:31.819 --> 23:33.611

Nice job.

23:41.412 --> 23:43.287
<i>- I'm a little nervous
about my handle.</i>

23:43.331 --> 23:45.539
It could have potential
to maybe fly out of your hands.

23:57.887 --> 24:00.638
Sweet.

24:00.681 --> 24:02.306
- Your blade held up well.

24:02.350 --> 24:04.433
You've got that heavy convex
edge that supported it.

24:04.477 --> 24:09.563
It split the ice quite well,
though not down as far as Craig.

24:09.607 --> 24:11.440
- Oh.

24:11.484 --> 24:15.110
- The handle... the handle
had a tendency to roll,

24:15.154 --> 24:16.945
especially on that last swing.

24:16.989 --> 24:19.948
It kind of glanced off,
but good job on the blade.

a very thin handle,

24:43.516 --> 24:46.350
a little harder to hold onto it
with those swings.

24:46.394 --> 24:50.521
But it stayed straight,

Nicely done.
- Thank you, sir.

24:52.775 --> 24:54.858

to slice through this rope.

24:58.364 --> 25:01.824
This sharpness test is going
to see how well your edges

25:01.867 --> 25:04.827

Craig, again, you're up first.

I would've liked to see it
take it all down, though.

25:22.680 --> 25:26.515
- Got the toothy edge
that bites into the fibers,

and there was enough blade
to drag through.

25:28.436 --> 25:30.144

J's feedback was not a shock
to me at all.

it was pretty ridiculous.

to the "Forged in Fire" final,

28:22.568 --> 28:27.362
and you're both one step closer
to a check for $10,000.

28:27.406 --> 28:29.323
In the first two rounds
of competition,

28:29.366 --> 28:31.700
you forged a weapon
in your signature style.

28:31.744 --> 28:34.453
Now we're sending you back
to your home forges,

28:34.496 --> 28:38.790
where you will forge
an iconic weapon from history,

28:38.834 --> 28:40.417
the war hammer.

28:40.461 --> 28:42.544
- Nice.

28:42.588 --> 28:44.713
<i>- A war hammer
is a medieval weapon</i>

28:44.757 --> 28:46.715
<i>developed in the 14th century</i>

28:46.759 --> 28:48.425
<i>that came about primarily
as a response</i>

28:48.469 --> 28:51.011
<i>to advanced armor technology.</i>

28:51.055 --> 28:53.430
<i>By this time, the armorists
had created suits</i>

28:53.474 --> 28:56.433
<i>of plate armor
that were so hard and smooth</i>

28:56.477 --> 28:58.518
<i>that swords
would bounce off them.</i>

28:58.562 --> 29:01.229
<i>The war hammer could deliver
its full force to the target</i>

29:01.273 --> 29:04.733
<i>and do serious damage without
having to penetrate the armor.</i>

29:04.777 --> 29:07.694
<i>Its steel head with a spike
on one side had a handle</i>

29:07.738 --> 29:11.073
<i>that varied in length but was
generally just long enough</i>

29:11.116 --> 29:13.200
<i>to be wielded with one hand.</i>

29:13.243 --> 29:16.244
<i>The spiked end could be used
for hooking the target's legs,</i>

29:16.288 --> 29:18.080
<i>reins, or shield,</i>

29:18.123 --> 29:20.457
<i>or used
as an armor-piercing device.</i>

29:20.501 --> 29:23.126
<i>As the use
of body armor declined,</i>

29:23.170 --> 29:24.670
<i>so did the need
for the war hammer.</i>

29:24.713 --> 29:26.922
<i>However, it can still
be seen today</i>

29:26.966 --> 29:29.424
<i>in the popular film
trilogy "The Hobbit"</i>

29:29.468 --> 29:33.720
<i>and has lent its name
to board game Warhammer.</i>

29:33.764 --> 29:36.390
Your challenge is to forge
a war hammer.

29:36.433 --> 29:38.266
It must be an authentic,

29:38.310 --> 29:41.812
fully functioning version
of that late-medieval weapon.

29:41.855 --> 29:43.647
<i>- I feel a little bit
confident on it.</i>

29:43.691 --> 29:45.451
<i>It's a weapon
I'm a little bit familiar with,</i>

29:45.484 --> 29:47.776
Plus, I use a hammer
on a daily basis.

29:47.820 --> 29:50.278
- The weapon parameters
are as follows.

29:50.322 --> 29:54.616
The length of the head
must be at least 2 1/2 inches,

29:54.660 --> 29:58.453
and the length of the pike must
be at least 3 inches in length.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.122
- I've never made a war hammer,

30:00.165 --> 30:03.625
<i>but I've made some hatchets
and tomahawks.</i>

30:03.669 --> 30:06.586
- So you will have five days
to complete this challenge.

30:06.630 --> 30:08.797
When the five days is up,
you will return

30:08.841 --> 30:12.050
and present your war hammers
to our panel of judges.

30:12.094 --> 30:13.635
They will submit those weapons

30:13.679 --> 30:16.972
<i>to a series of dynamic
and rigorous tests.</i>

30:17.016 --> 30:18.849
When the testing is complete,

30:18.892 --> 30:22.060
they will decide which of you
is the "Forged in Fire" champion

30:22.104 --> 30:24.521
and walks away with $10,000.

30:24.565 --> 30:26.398

a close-quarters weapon.

37:43.295 --> 37:45.003
- Thanks.

37:45.046 --> 37:46.963
- Bladesmiths, now it's time
for the kill test.

37:47.007 --> 37:50.425
War hammers have been known
to deliver piercing blows

37:50.469 --> 37:54.012
into armor and crush
the person behind it.

37:54.055 --> 37:56.347
I will deliver strikes
at this ballistic dummy

37:56.391 --> 37:58.057
that's wearing armor.

37:58.101 --> 38:00.894
Then we can see how much lethal
damage your war hammer can give.

38:00.937 --> 38:02.353
Craig, you're up.
Are you ready?

38:02.397 --> 38:04.022
- I'm ready.
Let's do it.

38:07.068 --> 38:15.068

38:18.580 --> 38:23.875
- Craig, I love the balance
of this blade, no indentations.

38:23.919 --> 38:28.087
Now let's see how much damage
we put on the dummy.

38:28.131 --> 38:30.381
No visible broken bones,

38:30.425 --> 38:33.051
but that definitely did pierce
the skin.

38:33.094 --> 38:35.512
- Nice.

38:35.555 --> 38:38.056
This will definitely kill.

38:38.099 --> 38:40.016
Nicely done, sir.
- Thank you.

38:40.060 --> 38:41.392
- Jeff, you're up next.
You ready?

38:41.436 --> 38:43.394
- Yes, sir.

38:43.438 --> 38:46.439
<i>The kill test, it's the most
important part to me.</i>

38:46.483 --> 38:49.609
I want it to smash that piece
of plate steel, break some ribs,

38:49.653 --> 38:50.944
and ruin some organs.

38:50.987 --> 38:53.947
<i>[rock music]</i>

38:53.990 --> 39:01.990
¶ ¶

39:05.460 --> 39:08.753
- Well, Jeff, looks like
the other langet did break off.

39:08.797 --> 39:10.171
<i>Do you know what?</i>

39:10.215 --> 39:12.257
This is still very sturdy.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.218
But let's see how much damage
it's done internally.

39:15.262 --> 39:17.178
¶ ¶

39:17.222 --> 39:19.681
He's got some broken ribs right
here, broken bones throughout.

39:19.724 --> 39:21.266
It went all the way through.

39:21.309 --> 39:24.143
And even through armor,
you pierced the skin,

39:24.187 --> 39:26.521
and you caused
some internal damage.

39:26.565 --> 39:29.107
Jeff, your weapon will kill.

39:29.150 --> 39:30.608
- Awesome.
- Good job.

39:30.652 --> 39:32.110
- Thank you.

39:32.153 --> 39:34.279
- Gentlemen,
this is the strength test.

39:34.322 --> 39:37.448
The war hammer was a favorite
on the medieval battlefield.

39:37.492 --> 39:39.284
So I'm gonna
take your war hammer

39:39.327 --> 39:41.119
and to test its strength
and durability,

39:41.162 --> 39:43.621
I'm gonna take several blows
against our stone wall

39:43.665 --> 39:45.373
and see
how much of this I can move.

39:45.417 --> 39:46.958
<i>- You know,
I'm feeling pretty nervous.</i>

39:47.002 --> 39:48.459
I know what it's capable of.

39:48.503 --> 39:49.961
I've worked with it at home.

39:50.005 --> 39:51.296
But still, yeah,
watching somebody else do it,

39:51.339 --> 39:52.630
it's nerve-racking for me.

40:27.292 --> 40:30.084
- Wow, that held up really well.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.170
And that's pretty much a hole
I could crawl through.

40:32.213 --> 40:33.963
That'll work.

40:34.007 --> 40:35.298
- Perfect.

40:35.342 --> 40:37.258
- So the handle...
What I do like is,

40:37.302 --> 40:39.761
I could swing it one-handed,
but with two hands,

40:39.804 --> 40:41.971
I could generate a heck
of a lot of energy.

40:42.015 --> 40:43.348
Beautiful job.

40:43.391 --> 40:45.683
- Excellent, excellent.
Thank you.

40:45.727 --> 40:47.644
- Jeff, you're up.

40:58.948 --> 41:00.615
- It's long,
and when I was swinging,

41:00.659 --> 41:02.283
it was way out in front of me

41:02.327 --> 41:05.119
as opposed
to being close and in control.

41:05.163 --> 41:06.954
Shot some sparks off.

<i>- Right, I seen that.</i>

41:08.833 --> 41:10.583

a good performance.

- Great.

41:12.712 --> 41:15.380
- Well, gentlemen, you've given
the judges a lot to consider.

41:15.423 --> 41:17.924
We'll see you back at the Forge.

41:17.967 --> 41:20.301
<i>[tense music]</i>

41:20.345 --> 41:24.597
Craig, Jeff, you were given
five days at your home forge

41:24.641 --> 41:26.599
to fabricate war hammers,

41:26.643 --> 41:30.186
and you both performed very well
in our weapons tests.

41:30.230 --> 41:33.356
But there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" champion.

41:33.400 --> 41:36.025
J?
- Craig, that's a great piece.

41:36.069 --> 41:37.860
<i>Your fit
and finish is outstanding,</i>

41:37.904 --> 41:39.987
<i>and I love the fact that you
can see</i>

41:40.031 --> 41:42.824
<i>the differential heat treat
in the hammerhead and beak.</i>

41:42.867 --> 41:46.119
There is a slight delamination
in one corner of the hammer face

41:46.162 --> 41:49.497
that does concern me
a little bit, though.

41:49.541 --> 41:51.666
- Jeff, there's a word that
they call "functional art."

41:51.710 --> 41:53.626
You have it right there.

41:53.670 --> 41:58.005
<i>The beautiful design you have
of that hammer is amazing.</i>

41:58.049 --> 42:00.299
My only concern was,
during the kill test,

42:00.343 --> 42:01.926
<i>the langlet came off.</i>

42:01.970 --> 42:04.303
It could've been better secured.

42:04.347 --> 42:07.473
- Gentlemen,
it was not an easy decision.

42:07.517 --> 42:10.101
Both of your weapons are superb,

42:10.145 --> 42:13.646
but there can only be
one "Forged in Fire" champion.

Congratulations.
- Thank you.

42:20.447 --> 42:24.031
- Jeff, your weapon
did not make the cut.

42:24.075 --> 42:26.242
- Jeff, with pieces coming
off of it, and the fact

42:26.286 --> 42:29.203
that it can only really be used
as a two-handed weapon,

42:29.247 --> 42:33.124
those things added together
started to become a problem.

your war hammer.

receiving a check for $10,000.

42:53.396 --> 42:55.646
- I'm just stoked.
It's crazy.

42:55.690 --> 42:57.899
This experience,
it was a grueling process.

42:57.942 --> 42:59.734
You know, I got to do something
that I really enjoyed

42:59.778 --> 43:01.319
