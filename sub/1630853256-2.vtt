WEBVTT

00:25.442 --> 00:27.402
Where is my money?

00:27.986 --> 00:29.029
Grandma?

00:29.112 --> 00:30.572
Yeah, uh…

00:31.573 --> 00:35.493
Let me just start by saying
I am as mad about this as you are.

00:35.577 --> 00:38.788
I knew it. You stole from me.
My own daughter.

00:38.872 --> 00:41.875
No, um, not me.

00:41.958 --> 00:44.294
I mean, well, yes, me,

00:44.377 --> 00:47.088
but, uh, I'm not even me right now,

00:47.172 --> 00:49.674
and it wasn't even technically me, Nora.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.302
It was actually--
it was this guy, Chez, uh,

00:53.094 --> 00:54.095
Chez Carrera.

00:54.179 --> 00:57.891
Uh, and let me just say, this guy
is really on my shitlist too, Grandma.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.603
Oh fuck.

01:02.645 --> 01:05.106
A little early in the morning
for Hungarian, huh?

01:05.190 --> 01:07.442
Hmm?

01:07.525 --> 01:08.985
All right, let me guess.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.530
This is about how we were, um, Hungarians,

01:12.614 --> 01:16.034
uh, big shots, intellectuals, uh,

01:16.117 --> 01:18.828
then the Nazis came, stole everything,

01:18.912 --> 01:20.497
put it on a gold train.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.124
I know, I've heard it
a million times before.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.752
Hey, I guess we're just cutting out
the middle mom now, right?

01:30.173 --> 01:31.216
This and this.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.635
This junk.

01:33.718 --> 01:36.888
You do nothing but take and take.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.433
Those coins
were the only security we had--

01:40.517 --> 01:41.893
For when Hitler comes back.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.770
I know. I know.

01:43.853 --> 01:45.438
Regimes change,

01:46.022 --> 01:48.149
currencies become obsolete,

01:48.233 --> 01:49.984
only gold remains, yeah.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.403
We Vulvokovs exist in the sweet spot

01:52.487 --> 01:54.697
where paranoia meets hyperinflation.

01:57.951 --> 01:58.910
I've upset you.

01:58.993 --> 02:00.703
Uh, hmm.

02:01.704 --> 02:03.414
All right. Uh…

02:03.498 --> 02:08.711
Hey, what's Hungarian
for, uh, "In the end, it's just money,

02:09.295 --> 02:10.797
we'll get through this together…"

02:11.339 --> 02:12.340
Oh!

02:12.423 --> 02:17.053
"…and the, uh, the baby is a chance
for a new relationship"?

02:17.137 --> 02:18.930
You had no right.

02:19.013 --> 02:21.516
You cannot undo this. This is done.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.935
You know, for you, yes.

02:24.018 --> 02:27.355
For me, it's a little more loosey-goosey.

02:27.438 --> 02:28.982
What's that "loosey-goose"?

02:29.065 --> 02:30.024
Mmm.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.861
Well, you know, just to say that, uh,

02:32.944 --> 02:36.656
I'm on it, all right?
I just need to find this motherfucker.

02:36.739 --> 02:38.408
Such a disappointment.

02:39.284 --> 02:40.994
All I went through.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.246
You wouldn't have made it out alive.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.164
My God.

02:45.248 --> 02:48.126
That is a fucked up thing
to say to your daughter, huh?

02:48.751 --> 02:50.003
Ah…

02:50.587 --> 02:52.630
You know what? Fuck all this.
I was trying to be nice,

02:52.714 --> 02:55.175
but let's not pussyfoot
around the sick dynamics going on here.

02:55.258 --> 02:59.846
You lorded that money over her head
her entire fucking life, yeah?

02:59.929 --> 03:01.890
Meantime, she cast you
as the evil puppet-master

03:01.973 --> 03:03.808
with herself as the victim head case.

03:03.892 --> 03:07.187
Cut to the end of the story,
it was meant to be my inheritance anyway.

03:07.270 --> 03:12.483
Ipso facto, it's mine,
conventionally, and by proxy, huh?

03:12.567 --> 03:15.695
Not yours, not Mom's, mines.

03:16.863 --> 03:17.822
Sorry to be a cunt.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.909
Why are you talking like this?
Cunt and fuck?

03:21.784 --> 03:22.911
Noraleh…

03:24.078 --> 03:24.913
…wait.

03:25.663 --> 03:26.539
Don't go.

03:27.624 --> 03:28.791
This…

03:28.875 --> 03:30.084
this is fucked.

03:33.588 --> 03:34.881
You know what, Vera?

03:34.964 --> 03:36.132
I love you.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.762
All this aside, it was great to see ya.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.388
Seriously.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.557
Peace out, all right?

03:46.643 --> 03:50.104
How the fuck does anyone find anyone
without the Internet around here?

03:51.231 --> 03:53.066
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

03:54.108 --> 03:55.401
Touché, paper.

03:57.362 --> 03:58.488
Terrific.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.449
Okay, let's see.

04:02.200 --> 04:04.535
For Carrera.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.578
Carrera…

04:06.079 --> 04:07.080
Chezare…

04:08.331 --> 04:10.792
Does this motherfucker even exist?

04:12.168 --> 04:14.254
Too cold for this shit.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.589
You're coming with me.

04:17.715 --> 04:19.467
<i>His name is Chezare Carrera.</i>

04:19.550 --> 04:21.261
-<i> Chezare Carrera?</i>
-<i>Yeah.</i>

04:21.344 --> 04:25.515
Uh, incidentally,
not the father of this baby.

04:25.598 --> 04:29.310
Uh, also, not in the phone book.
But so many Campbells.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.937
A lot of Campbells. Anything else?

04:31.020 --> 04:32.981
Do you know where he works?
Does he have a job?

04:33.064 --> 04:36.234
-Does he have a family? What's up?
-Uh, I think he works robbing me.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.989
Uh, I'm not sure you understand
exactly what it is we do here.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.532
Well, I don't need to.

04:42.615 --> 04:45.743
Uh, do you know what a-- a Krugerrand is?

04:45.827 --> 04:48.162
-I definitely don't, ma'am.
-Yeah, it's pretty obscure.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.623
Uh, it's a South African gold bullion.

04:50.707 --> 04:54.252
Well, on average, you're looking at
roughly $1800 an ounce.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.504
Now granted, those are millennial prices,

04:56.587 --> 04:58.464
but I don't want us
to get off track here, Derek.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.383
Cool. I'm still not sure
where this is going.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.176
My grandparents were holocaust survivors.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.594
Wow, okay. I'm sorry to hear that.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.305
-Well, that's not on you.
-I know.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.390
So anyway, after the war,

05:07.473 --> 05:11.227
a lot of survivors became paranoid
about putting their money in banks.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.896
My grandmother, however,

05:13.980 --> 05:18.234
well, she-- she acquired 150
of these bad boys.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.070
-How much money are we talking?
-Ah, great question.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.865
Now, you see, the price of gold,
it fluctuates, right?

05:23.948 --> 05:26.284
So, on average, on a given day,

05:26.367 --> 05:28.077
uh, last time I checked,

05:28.161 --> 05:31.581
$280,451.21.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.041
Shit.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.251
-Oh that's big money. Okay.
-Oh yeah, big money.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.879
It would've been my college tuition
and probably a racehorse.

05:37.962 --> 05:41.132
-So anyway, you can see my predicament.
-Yeah, I can see that.

05:41.215 --> 05:43.009
Let me take everything you know about him,

05:43.092 --> 05:45.219
and, uh, give me two or three weeks
to track him down.

05:47.638 --> 05:50.058
-Two to three weeks?
-You know somebody who can do it faster?

05:50.141 --> 05:54.062
Oh, well, not someone, somewhen.

05:54.145 --> 05:57.023
Uh, I got a little tool
called the World Wide Web.

05:57.106 --> 05:58.316
That sounds nefarious.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.901
Oh, you have no idea.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.779
Anyway, uh, we tried.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.530
Thank you so much.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.199
-Keep the phone book.
-Sure.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.825
Yeah, I can't take it where I'm going.

06:07.909 --> 06:09.869
Well, shouldn't carry much anyway.

06:09.952 --> 06:11.329
-Yeah.
-Watch yourself getting out.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.039
-Oh sure. Thanks.
-Here you go.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.666
-Careful. Coming through.
-You be careful getting upstairs.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.419
-All right. Adios.
-Have a good night. Get home safe.

06:19.837 --> 06:20.922
Weird-ass person.

06:21.756 --> 06:22.757
Lot of problems.

06:30.723 --> 06:32.308
Ah, what do we got here?

06:33.184 --> 06:35.186
All right, I'm coming.
I'm coming, assholes.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.232
Jesus. Why don't
these fuckers give me time?

06:40.358 --> 06:43.611
Hey. Okay, bada-bing.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.825
I'm working on a new piece
in which I give my audience a knife

06:48.908 --> 06:51.327
and I dare them
to divide my body up into zones.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.496
It's called "The 38th Parallel."

06:53.579 --> 06:54.705
Splendid.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.665
Oh, thank you.

06:55.748 --> 06:56.874
White meat or dark meat?

06:56.958 --> 06:59.127
Oh, you girls go ahead.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.671
Max thinks borders
are an oppressive delusion,

07:01.754 --> 07:02.922
like the stock market.

07:03.005 --> 07:06.634
No,
we've always needed boundaries

07:06.717 --> 07:10.972
to understand where we end
and others begin.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.683
It's not always splitting the baby.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.893
But when it comes to the Korean War,
I am the baby.

07:15.977 --> 07:17.103
Mmm.

07:17.186 --> 07:18.896
Ruthie! Back on top.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.607
Uh, I'm so sorry
that I did not make it back last night.

07:21.691 --> 07:25.069
Crazy, crazy next-level shit went down.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.154
Found the Valium.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.489
Oh, thank you.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.158
Thank you so much.

07:30.241 --> 07:32.493
Now look,
I'm just gonna go lie down for a bit.

07:32.577 --> 07:35.246
You just leave the dishes.

07:35.329 --> 07:37.790
-Come on, I'll help you upstairs.
-Oh, bless you.

07:38.374 --> 07:40.460
Thank--

07:40.543 --> 07:42.378
-Ruthie.
-Thank you.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.381
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine. I'm okay. I'm okay.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.258
You have to be careful
with this stuff.

07:47.341 --> 07:48.926
Betty Ford was addicted to it.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.971
Yeah,
as was every other woman in suburbia.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.682
-And listen, as you know, I treated them.
-Oh yeah?

07:54.765 --> 07:56.893
-Where were you?
-Who did you treat?

07:56.976 --> 07:57.894
Ah!

07:57.977 --> 07:58.895
Uh…

07:59.562 --> 08:02.815
Would you believe me if I said
I picked up this guy at the Public Enemy

08:02.899 --> 08:05.026
and ended up almost fucking
my dead mother's boyfriend?

08:05.109 --> 08:07.236
Yes, I would. That's kind of the issue.

08:07.737 --> 08:09.155
-Nemo…

08:09.238 --> 08:11.532
…the doctors were very concerned.

08:11.616 --> 08:13.159
They found a lump in her neck.

08:13.242 --> 08:16.245
They did a fine-needle aspiration
and a chest X-ray.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.334
And it's a little weird, no?
You chasing Ruth's ambulance?

08:21.417 --> 08:24.837
Fetishizing death is not incompatible
with genuinely caring.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.048
I know this is difficult.

08:27.131 --> 08:30.092
I did six months
as a puppeteer in hospice.

08:30.176 --> 08:32.136
She's not dying, Maxine.

08:32.762 --> 08:36.057
Anyway, soon, I'll be able to afford
all the best doctors

08:36.140 --> 08:38.226
and all the classiest X-rays.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.894
I mean, I love Ruth. She knows that.

08:40.478 --> 08:41.312
Okay.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.438
Mm-hmm.

08:59.288 --> 09:00.122
Huh.

09:00.915 --> 09:02.250
The Bronx, baby.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.628
-Open up.

09:05.711 --> 09:06.712
Hey. Hello.

09:07.296 --> 09:09.006
You're two hours past your window.

09:11.717 --> 09:12.718
You're not the cable guy.

09:12.802 --> 09:15.054
Ring-a-ding-a-ling-a-bell?

09:15.137 --> 09:16.097
Yeah.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.182
Google and I did a deep dive on you.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.850
-What?
-Excuse me.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.894
-Ex-- What?
-Coming through. Choo-choo.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.522
Aye. Yeah.

09:26.482 --> 09:29.026
Excuse me. What can I do for you?

09:29.110 --> 09:33.197
Besides screwing me and my dead mother,
both of which you've already done?

09:33.281 --> 09:34.407
What?

09:34.490 --> 09:37.285
If you're trying to remember,
her name was Nora.

09:39.996 --> 09:40.830
Nadia?

09:40.913 --> 09:42.248
Ah-ha!

09:43.583 --> 09:46.419
Oh, wow. Of course I remember.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.463
Nora was a good person.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.549
We had a good run.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.385
Oh yeah. Yeah, a great run.

09:54.468 --> 09:57.513
And at the finish line,
I got the medal, right?

09:58.347 --> 09:59.599
But only one.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.059
This is about the gold?

10:03.436 --> 10:06.480
Oh my God, kid, look around.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.232
I haven't got your money.

10:08.316 --> 10:11.319
I'm not exactly, uh, King Midas.

10:11.902 --> 10:15.656
You know, if I was you,
I would drop the whole thing.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.074
Really.

10:17.158 --> 10:21.579
Uh, look, man, I didn't really come here
to have the thief

10:21.662 --> 10:24.665
give me advice
on getting back my family inheritance.

10:24.749 --> 10:28.002
No, what I mean is, it's a Coney Island.

10:28.085 --> 10:30.630
What do you mean?
The last stop on the D train?

10:30.713 --> 10:33.424
In our house, a Coney Island

10:33.507 --> 10:36.218
is the thing
that would've made everything better,

10:36.302 --> 10:38.220
if only it had happened,

10:38.304 --> 10:39.555
or didn't happen.

10:40.556 --> 10:42.391
My father couldn't work.

10:42.475 --> 10:45.561
He got sick with polio
and wound up in an iron lung.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.273
Now, if only he hadn't gone
to Coney Island that summer,

10:49.357 --> 10:51.275
he wouldn't have gotten
the airborne polio.

10:51.359 --> 10:52.818
But he did.

10:52.902 --> 10:53.986
It's a fantasy.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.280
It's an "if only."

10:57.657 --> 10:59.825
Your mom and me and the gold…

11:01.744 --> 11:03.120
it was all a Coney Island.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.455
Hmm.

11:05.581 --> 11:06.415
Wow.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.126
That's a lovely story,

11:09.210 --> 11:11.712
and I'm sorry to hear about
all that polio.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.384
But now, I'm done playing footsie.

11:16.467 --> 11:20.846
What I wanna know is,
where you went after you stole the gold.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.431
Specifics, please.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.934
Jesus Christ.
I'm trying to be a decent person.

11:25.017 --> 11:25.851
Bullshit.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.145
If she'd wanted you to know,
she would've told ya.

11:28.896 --> 11:29.814
Okay?

11:30.314 --> 11:32.650
May I ask you something about your mom?

11:33.776 --> 11:35.111
She ever move away?

11:36.028 --> 11:37.947
She ever get to be her own person?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.574
You know, that was her--
That was her thing.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.416
Oh, you like squash?

11:49.417 --> 11:53.254
I was the, uh, Bowery Rec Center champion
three years in a row.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.048
I'm a little rusty, but, uh…

11:57.925 --> 12:00.136
I still got quads
like a stallion.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.722
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.683
Legs are the bicycles on the ride of life.

12:09.103 --> 12:10.813
Thanks a lot, Chezare.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.857
A real dirtbag, huh?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.817
Real fucking dirtbag.

12:15.484 --> 12:16.402
It's nice to see you.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.043
<i>This is downtown local 6 train</i>

12:33.127 --> 12:35.296
<i>to Brooklyn Bridge</i>
<i>approaching the station.</i>

12:38.090 --> 12:39.467
<i>Next stop, Astor Place.</i>

12:40.301 --> 12:41.552
Membership card?

12:41.635 --> 12:42.470
Oh.

12:42.970 --> 12:47.808
Oh, would you let, uh,
Mr. Lincoln exercise here?

12:47.892 --> 12:50.895
You can get a day pass for $3.75.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.063
Okay, great.
Can I get one of those then, please?

12:56.942 --> 12:59.069
Oh man!

12:59.153 --> 12:59.987
Oh.

13:00.070 --> 13:03.199
-Uh, hello. Good morning, everyone, uh--
-We're in the middle of a game.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.827
Uh, do you guys know, uh, Chez Carrera?

13:06.911 --> 13:08.287
You one of Chez's girls?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.623
Well, sure. Yes. Very cool.

13:10.706 --> 13:11.749
He'll turn up.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.167
He put a bun in that oven?

13:14.960 --> 13:18.005
Oh, wow, so you guys just really
don't know how sperm work, huh?

13:18.088 --> 13:19.173
What are you talking about?

13:19.256 --> 13:21.842
Men don't make women pregnant,
sperm are weak.

13:21.926 --> 13:26.180
They only get the job done when the egg
beams them up to the Federation Starship

13:26.263 --> 13:28.557
and then you make a baby. Uh--

13:29.141 --> 13:33.729
What would you guys know
with your tight little 1982 gym shorts?

13:33.813 --> 13:37.191
Really, it's a little titty twister,
but for dicks, huh?

13:37.274 --> 13:39.693
Okay, haven't had coffee yet.
Good day to you.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.821
-It must be fun, man.

13:42.613 --> 13:44.156
Chez is into some shit.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.286
Hey, Allison. How you doing?

13:50.412 --> 13:51.288
Still me.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.253
Don't sell my autograph.

14:16.146 --> 14:17.898
Hey, knock-knock, you little bitch.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.358
Jesus, Nora.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.069
You can't be in here.

14:22.152 --> 14:26.282
Well, you see, I may look like Nora,
but I don't play games.

14:26.365 --> 14:28.367
Just last night, I murdered a rock,

14:28.450 --> 14:30.661
I injured a stone, I hospitalized a brick.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.621
I'm so mean I make medicine sick.

14:32.705 --> 14:33.664
Okay.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.375
Uh, you're Muhammad Ali now?

14:36.458 --> 14:38.419
Last night, I got in bed,
the lights were still on,

14:38.502 --> 14:39.879
got back out of bed, hit the light,

14:39.962 --> 14:42.506
got back in bed before the light
turned out. That's quick.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.966
I'm bad quick.

14:44.049 --> 14:46.093
And I fight Mr. Tooth Decay.

14:46.176 --> 14:48.387
So where are my fucking Krugerrands?

14:48.470 --> 14:51.515
Shh! What is going on
with you? You're doing this again.

14:51.599 --> 14:54.018
-What do you mean, "again"?
-You did this already.

14:54.101 --> 14:56.020
-Huh?
-You got the money last night.

14:56.103 --> 15:00.649
Nora, you came over
and got your money back last night.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.111
You got a little more than that, actually.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.030
I don't believe you.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.406
You're a liar,

15:07.489 --> 15:10.534
so you're even lying to me now,
or you lied to me 40 years from now

15:10.618 --> 15:12.620
when you didn't tell me that
Nora got the money back.

15:12.703 --> 15:15.122
What are you talking about,
"40 years from now"?

15:15.205 --> 15:18.083
What's going on here?
What happened to your face?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.418
You happened.

15:19.501 --> 15:20.628
Last night.

15:22.004 --> 15:23.088
I kind of enjoyed it.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.090
-Oh yeah?

15:25.174 --> 15:26.675
-Yeah.
-What happened?

15:26.759 --> 15:28.886
What, you playing rubbing privates? Yeah?

15:28.969 --> 15:30.971
-Well, uh…
-Yeah?

15:31.055 --> 15:31.972
Where's my money now?

15:32.056 --> 15:35.684
I gave you your money back last night.

15:36.810 --> 15:40.439
-What did you do with it? Where is it?
-Uh, I don't know.

15:42.733 --> 15:44.443
Oh shit.

15:44.526 --> 15:46.737
-What?
-Of course. She bought the car.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.281
-Are we still on for tonight?

15:49.365 --> 15:54.370
Uh, I hope not. But knowing my mom,
then, you know, probably.

15:56.872 --> 16:00.960
Come on. Of course, yeah.

16:02.044 --> 16:02.878
Typical.

16:03.462 --> 16:04.797
Good old Alpha.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.508
Classic move, Mom.

16:09.551 --> 16:10.844
Sorry, Nora.

16:10.928 --> 16:14.431
It looks like Santa's gotta take
your little Spider back to the North Pole.

16:16.392 --> 16:17.351
What the--

16:17.434 --> 16:18.435
Hey.

16:18.519 --> 16:20.980
Whoa, whoa, whoa! That's my mom's stuff.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.067
Hey, sorry, lady, this is my-- my stuff.

16:25.776 --> 16:29.446
Your mother says no more paying
for the apartment, the clothes.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.365
No more, just the baby.

16:31.448 --> 16:34.410
She'll take care of you
because you are the mother of the baby.

16:34.493 --> 16:35.327
Huh?

16:35.411 --> 16:39.373
Oh, actually, the baby of the mother,
but, uh, let's not get into it.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.208
Why did you steal this gold, Nora?

16:41.291 --> 16:43.043
It was so important to her.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.170
So much more than just coins.

16:45.254 --> 16:48.090
Look, man, I'm really sorry, you know?
I'm trying to fix it.

16:48.173 --> 16:50.676
Your family had so much life in Budapest,

16:50.759 --> 16:52.302
and then one day,

16:52.386 --> 16:54.221
poof, nothing.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.305
No one left.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.892
But you show her survival
no respect.

16:59.476 --> 17:00.436
Look, uh…

17:01.520 --> 17:04.690
of course I respect
my grandmother survived.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.443
Why do you disgrace this enchantment?

17:08.110 --> 17:11.947
Oh my God, Jesus Christ.
I mean, what is this, the occult?

17:12.031 --> 17:14.658
We're Ashkenazi Jews, not wizards.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.619
Yes, uh, this is translation problem.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.204
Not enchantment.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.372
Miracle.

17:20.956 --> 17:23.959
An impossible thing happened to Vera,
and you stole it.

17:24.043 --> 17:25.377
What impossible thing?

17:25.461 --> 17:26.670
Nora.

17:26.754 --> 17:27.588
Ugh, Ruth.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.300
Ruth? Uh--

17:31.383 --> 17:33.135
Holy shit, Ruthie.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.971
Look at this.
Eat your heart out, Melanie Griffith.

17:36.055 --> 17:39.183
Okay, stop. I've been trying
to track you down all day.

17:39.266 --> 17:41.060
I'm-- I'm right here.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.478
I tried to pay her off, but…

17:42.561 --> 17:44.897
-I don't come cheap.
-Delia.

17:44.980 --> 17:45.939
Mm-hmm.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.192
-How are you?
-I mean…

17:48.859 --> 17:51.195
-A widow has to worry about you.
-A widow?

17:51.278 --> 17:53.572
She has her own problems,

17:53.655 --> 17:56.700
and she's running to the phone
every five minutes to find you.

17:56.784 --> 17:58.327
It's okay, Delia.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.620
Keeps me on my toes.

18:00.412 --> 18:01.246
I don't mind.

18:02.289 --> 18:04.458
Uh, you know how to drive stick?

18:04.541 --> 18:06.418
Do I know how to drive stick?

18:07.002 --> 18:08.587
Okay. Yeah.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.215
Sounds like a yes, okay?

18:11.840 --> 18:14.510
Look, yeah, really,
you're gonna have so many husbands.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.220
Nora, I'm mourning.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.889
God, you really
were a great driver, Ruthie.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.767
-What?
-I said, it's good to see you smile.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.527
-Oh God, this car is fun to drive.
-Yeah.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.987
And you are absolutely right to return it.

18:34.071 --> 18:36.698
It's the responsible thing to do.
I am proud of you.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.991
-Ah!

18:38.075 --> 18:39.743
Can I ask you a question, Ruthie?

18:39.827 --> 18:43.789
Uh, what is wrong with my mom?

18:43.872 --> 18:45.499
-Your mom?
-Yeah.

18:45.582 --> 18:48.627
Um, she went through stuff
we can't even imagine.

18:48.710 --> 18:49.711
Auschwitz.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.548
I don't think
we'll ever get inside her head.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.508
Or she was born that way.

18:54.591 --> 18:57.553
Nature versus nurture.
But can we stop talking about this?

18:57.636 --> 19:00.013
I don't love yelling "Auschwitz"
in a car dealership.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.682
Well, who does?

19:02.558 --> 19:04.643
You know, tell you what it actually is.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.478
Epigenetics.

19:07.396 --> 19:11.024
Yeah. Nature versus nurture doesn't exist.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.818
You know who came up with that scam?

19:12.901 --> 19:14.611
Francis Galton,

19:14.695 --> 19:17.030
the founder of eugenics.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.158
-What?
-Eugenics.

19:19.241 --> 19:20.492
Nora.

19:21.785 --> 19:24.329
Look at you, sprightly little thing.

19:24.413 --> 19:25.956
You look so gorgeous.

19:26.039 --> 19:29.501
Look at this. Turns out
I'm the Norm of this, uh, Cheers.

19:30.544 --> 19:31.378
Eh.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.298
Okay, nothing. Too soon.

19:34.381 --> 19:37.634
Well, all you really need to know
is he's a cutie-pie alcohol abuser

19:37.718 --> 19:39.720
in a loveless marriage, eh.

19:39.803 --> 19:43.056
And I would like to return
one car, please.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.976
Oh, you just bought it.
Is there some kind of problem?

19:46.059 --> 19:47.811
Oh, all kinds of problems.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.730
-Oh.
-Yeah, all kinds.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.482
-It's a real change of heart.

19:53.066 --> 19:57.029
Nora, you're here all the time.
You've wanted this so long.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.780
I just hate to see you--

19:58.864 --> 20:02.326
Well, I am her therapist,
and this is all under my direction.

20:02.409 --> 20:05.787
Well, I was just trying to be nice.
I don't need a doctor's note.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.082
Uh, the car depreciates in value
the moment it's off the lot,

20:09.166 --> 20:11.627
so I'm obligated to deduct a percentage.

20:11.710 --> 20:12.794
Of course you are.

20:13.629 --> 20:15.464
Well, just a smidge.

20:19.092 --> 20:22.721
Wait, I paid for this in cash?
I figured I would have paid in gold.

20:23.597 --> 20:26.058
I hope you find what you're looking for.

20:26.642 --> 20:30.979
Yeah. Well, fingers crossed,
it's all going in a trust for baby Nadia.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.773
You're naming the baby after me?

20:35.567 --> 20:38.195
-Well, that's a letdown.

20:38.278 --> 20:41.198
-Okay. All right. I guess we're done here.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.617
Hey, uh, let's check the trunk.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.746
Jesus fucking sable fest.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.916
Well, even Imelda Marcos
can't keep all the shoes.

20:50.999 --> 20:51.917
Yeah.

20:52.960 --> 20:53.877
All right.

20:56.713 --> 20:59.591
Well, wherever she bought these furs,
they got the coins.

21:02.427 --> 21:03.720
They're damaged.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.139
I'll take the return,
but I can't give you full price.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.933
Makes sense. Typical.

21:08.016 --> 21:11.103
Uh, all right, great.
Well, we're all negotiators,

21:11.186 --> 21:13.689
so, uh, there you go.

21:14.982 --> 21:17.484
Big business, cash money.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.278
Can I get my Krugerrands back now?

21:23.282 --> 21:24.366
That's it?

21:24.449 --> 21:27.577
Well, for what you gave me,
yeah, that's it.

21:27.661 --> 21:29.204
You're business owners, I get it.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.373
But I'm sorry to inform you
there's been an error.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.792
These Krugerrands
have been brought here by mistake.

21:33.875 --> 21:36.461
-Mistakes? It's half our business.

21:36.545 --> 21:39.756
Listen to me, I need those coins.
They're meant to be for my daughter,

21:39.840 --> 21:41.883
uh, you know, to give her something real

21:41.967 --> 21:44.052
to make up for all the things
I can't give her,

21:44.136 --> 21:45.762
which is, uh, a lot.

21:45.846 --> 21:49.725
There's a lot of things.
I'm talking basic life skills, etcetera.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.351
Oh no, here we go.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.270
Always a sob story.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.313
Do you need a bag?

21:54.396 --> 21:55.314
What?

21:55.856 --> 21:59.609
Jesus, look,
I-- I need all of those, all right?

21:59.693 --> 22:02.696
If my mom does not have all of those,

22:02.779 --> 22:03.989
she won't make it.

22:04.531 --> 22:05.615
She won't function.

22:05.699 --> 22:08.035
I know this for a fact.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.708
He's gone anyway, right?

22:19.212 --> 22:20.172
Yeah, that'll work.

22:22.507 --> 22:23.884
Goodnight. Hail Satan.

22:31.641 --> 22:32.809
Thanks, Ruthie.

22:40.400 --> 22:44.029
Well, yeah, the ring,
it's too big of a sacrifice.

22:44.112 --> 22:45.447
I don't deserve it. No.

22:46.031 --> 22:48.158
I don't deserve you, Ruthie.

22:48.241 --> 22:51.578
Oh, no one deserves what they get in life.
That's not how it works.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.747
You know? What's the ring to me?

22:53.830 --> 22:56.958
Sorry to be morbid, but it's a promise
from a dead man, and I would--

22:57.042 --> 22:59.503
I would rather
be alive with you.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.338
Hear, hear to that.

23:02.506 --> 23:06.593
Listen, you and me,
we got a long, long ways to go, all right?

23:06.676 --> 23:09.137
-Hmm.
-I'm basically like an oracle,

23:09.221 --> 23:10.138
just so you know.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.432
-Are you?
-Yeah. Basically.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.101
Speaking of the future,

23:14.184 --> 23:15.310
uh,

23:15.394 --> 23:17.938
enough with the, you know…

23:18.814 --> 23:21.525
You gotta stop fucking smoking, man.
You gotta stop smoking.

23:21.608 --> 23:23.610
Says the pregnant woman.

23:23.693 --> 23:25.987
The baby loves smoking.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.950
Me, I'm fine.
I got cryogenics, what have you, you know,

23:30.033 --> 23:31.159
but you, uh…

23:31.243 --> 23:32.452
-Oh yeah?
-Yeah.

23:32.536 --> 23:33.578
Well, up yours.

23:33.662 --> 23:37.040
Also, I want you to start
investing some money, okay?

23:37.124 --> 23:38.208
I'm talking real money.

23:38.291 --> 23:41.920
If you wanna make money,
put in some Tyson Foods, Grainger,

23:42.003 --> 23:44.172
Illinois Tool Works, Apple products--

23:44.256 --> 23:46.133
Nora. Nora! Nora.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.427
I know you're trying
to make me feel better,

23:48.510 --> 23:50.595
but I need you
to stop working so hard, okay?

23:50.679 --> 23:52.264
-All right?
-What did I do?

23:52.347 --> 23:55.267
I just need you
to be right here with me.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.768
Right here, right now.

23:57.727 --> 23:58.979
Can you do that?

23:59.980 --> 24:00.814
Okay?

24:01.690 --> 24:03.525
-Right here?
-Please.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.516
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>this is Nora, start talking.</i>

24:41.730 --> 24:42.564
Hey.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.232
Nora.

24:44.774 --> 24:48.987
Uh, don't freak out.
It's me, your daughter,

24:49.070 --> 24:51.531
calling you from somewhere
on the space-time continuum

24:51.615 --> 24:52.991
on the Upper East Side.

24:53.575 --> 24:57.746
Uh,I'm inside your body,
so that explains the voice,

24:57.829 --> 25:00.832
but don't be spooked by that, be cool.

25:00.916 --> 25:01.750
Uh…

25:02.501 --> 25:05.212
Yeah. So I guess I just wanna say hi,

25:05.295 --> 25:07.672
and that I'm--

25:08.423 --> 25:09.883
I'm really mad at you.

25:09.966 --> 25:11.760
Uh, yeah, you just--

25:12.552 --> 25:15.013
You mess up over and over,

25:15.096 --> 25:18.725
and it's just
pretty fucking hard to take, and, uh…

25:19.893 --> 25:22.812
Of course, you'll probably wind up
with Chez for a couple years.

25:22.896 --> 25:26.525
Uh, yeah, lo-- lower companions,

25:27.526 --> 25:29.611
water seeks its own level, etcetera.

25:29.694 --> 25:32.531
And, uh, I don't know,
good-- good for you.

25:33.198 --> 25:34.908
Better than being alone, I guess.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.494
Uh, so anyway, uh…

25:38.453 --> 25:41.331
I'm bringing the gold back
to Vera where it belongs to…

25:42.040 --> 25:44.376
I don't know, close this deranged
fucking loop and bounce.

25:44.459 --> 25:45.293
Um…

25:46.127 --> 25:49.339
I hope that this can be
a second chance for you guys,

25:49.422 --> 25:53.093
and that you don't just destroy things.

25:53.176 --> 25:54.177
So, uh…

25:56.388 --> 25:57.222
Yeah, okay.

25:57.305 --> 25:59.224
Uh, I love you.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.811
I tried my best. All right, yeah, bye.

26:09.734 --> 26:12.529
Fucking--
This is why they invented cell phones.

26:49.858 --> 26:50.734
Alan!

27:29.189 --> 27:30.732
Did somebody take my bag?

27:32.942 --> 27:34.611
Did you see who took my bag?

27:37.614 --> 27:39.032
Yo, did you take my bag?

27:42.577 --> 27:44.371
Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!
