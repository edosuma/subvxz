00:00.610 --> 00:04.100
Please don't try anything you are about to see at home.

00:04.420 --> 00:05.860
We're what you call experts.

00:08.070 --> 00:11.370
On this controversial episode of "Mythbusters,"

00:12.930 --> 00:14.720
it's all out war.

00:15.820 --> 00:19.410
Today is the day the battle of the sexes will be won.

00:19.690 --> 00:21.890
Go ladies, go ladies.

00:21.890 --> 00:25.940
by testing five age-old, gender based cliches.

00:26.720 --> 00:27.430
First up,

00:27.430 --> 00:30.470
the number one cause of heated marital discourse,

00:30.700 --> 00:32.170
women can't drive.

00:32.189 --> 00:34.180
I can tell the way they're driving, it's probably a woman.

00:34.870 --> 00:35.760
Next!

00:35.940 --> 00:39.510
Burn, baby, burn. Are men the master chefs?

00:39.930 --> 00:40.900
That's just raw.

00:40.970 --> 00:42.990
Who's better at reading emotions?

00:42.990 --> 00:44.380
It is flirty emotion.

00:45.640 --> 00:49.000
Is map reading more suited to the minds of men?

00:49.110 --> 00:52.320
Straight by...okay, we have to stop at somewhere. Stop.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.800
And packing the car,

00:54.170 --> 00:55.490
is it a men's world?

00:55.530 --> 00:57.520
You forgot the baby, the baby?

00:59.190 --> 01:00.930
That's not a good fairwell for the eggs.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.830
Who are the "Mythbusters"?

01:07.030 --> 01:07.920
Adam Savage,

01:07.950 --> 01:10.210
I reject your reality and substitute my own.

01:10.240 --> 01:11.260
and Jamie Heinaman.

01:11.410 --> 01:12.640
We're going to have an adventure.

01:13.250 --> 01:17.350
Between them, more than 30 years special effects experience.

01:17.910 --> 01:19.590
Together with Tory Belleci,

01:19.590 --> 01:20.880
Ah, I love challange.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.180
Grant Imahara

01:23.370 --> 01:24.490
and Kari Byron.

01:25.260 --> 01:26.050
Let's do it.

01:26.940 --> 01:28.870
They don't just tell the myths,

01:28.870 --> 01:31.770
they put them to the test!

01:33.000 --> 01:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:45.300 --> 01:46.290
Okay, come on.

01:47.100 --> 01:49.070
- Do we really have to do this? - Yes.

01:49.390 --> 01:50.410
Why exactly?

01:50.590 --> 01:52.800
Because we're doing an entire episode on men versus women,

01:53.090 --> 01:55.580
a battle of the sexes, a battle we are winning.

01:55.680 --> 01:57.110
Hold on, you're already winning?

01:57.310 --> 02:00.170
Last season we did men versus women for pain tolerance,

02:00.300 --> 02:01.410
we kicked your butts.

02:06.380 --> 02:10.530
Okay, if you say so. Since it is a competition.

02:12.630 --> 02:14.660
We're going to be testing all sorts of cliches

02:14.770 --> 02:16.440
like navigating is best done by --

02:16.790 --> 02:17.570
men.

02:17.580 --> 02:18.740
- Driving. - Men.

02:19.120 --> 02:20.140
- Grilling.  - Men.

02:20.240 --> 02:21.080
Arrogance?

02:22.290 --> 02:24.360
All right, well, before we get started,

02:24.360 --> 02:26.360
let's see if we can put science into this.

02:27.380 --> 02:28.910
Something we are also very good at.

02:29.260 --> 02:32.470
It is a fact there are a few physiological differences

02:32.730 --> 02:34.410
between male and female brains

02:34.740 --> 02:38.440
that may lead to advantages on certain types of tests.

02:38.600 --> 02:42.770
For example, the circuitry for spacial awareness

02:42.770 --> 02:43.690
is marginally faster in men,

02:44.190 --> 02:47.560
and women have slightly larger language setters.

02:47.890 --> 02:49.750
But in the real world gender wars,

02:50.020 --> 02:54.000
do these neurological subtleties lead to actual advantages.

02:54.350 --> 02:56.110
Well, there's only one way to find out.

02:56.440 --> 02:58.390
In a pitched battle of the sexes,

02:58.730 --> 03:01.250
the team is going to test all five of them.

03:01.530 --> 03:05.200
And kicking off the most controversial episode in "Mythbusters" history,

03:05.440 --> 03:06.510
it is a doozy.

03:07.070 --> 03:08.850
We don't have to armor ourselves for this one, do we?

03:08.860 --> 03:10.100
Luckily, no.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.040
So, for us, what's first?

03:12.270 --> 03:15.050
Well, it's driving. Men or women, who's better?

03:16.510 --> 03:20.310
I can already hear people yelling at their televisions right now.

03:20.590 --> 03:21.570
How do you want to test it?

03:21.760 --> 03:23.260
Well, I think it is pretty straightforward.

03:23.260 --> 03:26.950
We get ten men, ten women, a licensed driving instructor,

03:26.950 --> 03:29.340
put them on a EVOC course and see who is better.

03:29.620 --> 03:31.360
Alright, and to eliminate bias,

03:31.380 --> 03:32.040
we should make sure that

03:32.040 --> 03:34.610
the driving instructor doesn't know the gender of the person

03:34.610 --> 03:35.790
he is tesing at any given moment.

03:35.790 --> 03:37.100
Sounds like a good idea.

03:37.420 --> 03:39.160
Alright, let's bring on the controversy.

03:41.640 --> 03:44.780
It is a controversy as old as the automobile itself.

03:45.740 --> 03:49.190
Supposedly, women and driving just don't mix.

03:49.340 --> 03:51.370
But insurance data suggests

03:51.610 --> 03:53.630
that it is men who are the real road risks.

03:53.910 --> 03:56.270
- How am I doing? - A lot better than yesterday.

03:56.680 --> 03:59.540
So, which is the wheel deal?

04:00.540 --> 04:03.080
Well, we're back here at our favorite driving course,

04:03.180 --> 04:05.980
the EVOC at the Alameda County Sheriff's department.

04:06.310 --> 04:08.640
Just waiting for Adam. There he is.

04:09.340 --> 04:10.860
Check out my new ride!

04:11.110 --> 04:12.050
Nice.

04:13.760 --> 04:14.860
So what we're going to do here is

04:14.900 --> 04:17.060
to put an equal number of both male and female drivers

04:17.339 --> 04:18.550
through a standard driving course

04:18.769 --> 04:21.790
and see if we can tell which sex is better at driving!

04:22.210 --> 04:23.100
It's very simple.

04:24.300 --> 04:25.850
The concept may be simple,

04:25.940 --> 04:28.530
but as Jamie learns with instructor Jack Sage,

04:28.650 --> 04:30.900
the course is anything but.

04:31.050 --> 04:33.530
This is a bird's eye view of the police training course

04:33.830 --> 04:36.040
our test drivers will be tested upon.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.610
And let me bringing for you, the key components.

04:38.760 --> 04:40.200
We have accident avoidance.

04:40.250 --> 04:41.330
This one is tricky.

04:44.050 --> 04:44.980
K-turns.

04:46.590 --> 04:47.920
Close quarter turnaround.

04:48.610 --> 04:50.350
There is no rush on this.

04:50.550 --> 04:51.730
Parallel parking.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.620
Everybody's favoriate exercise.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.280
Up to speed and a quick stop.

04:56.510 --> 04:58.270
Then the forward slalom,

04:58.870 --> 05:01.200
and the kicker, the reverse slalom.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.520
Through out the course, Jack will be scoring the drivers.

05:04.520 --> 05:06.010
They will start with 100 points.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.720
But every time they hit a cone, break a speed limit, hesitate,

05:09.730 --> 05:12.450
or fail to follow directions, they're gonna get penalized.

05:12.820 --> 05:13.720
And then they're done.

05:14.160 --> 05:16.910
And with that, it's time to meet the volunteers

05:17.170 --> 05:20.320
who will be flying the flag for their entire gender.

05:20.370 --> 05:21.620
Hi, everybody.

05:22.620 --> 05:24.820
Thanks for coming to the Mythbusters driving school.

05:25.130 --> 05:27.430
And after getting a run-down of the rule book.

05:27.590 --> 05:29.420
You have seven minutes to complete the test.

05:29.420 --> 05:32.840
The course speed limit is 25 miles per hour.

05:33.150 --> 05:34.610
There in for a surprise.

05:34.690 --> 05:37.280
Most importantly, it is vital your identity

05:37.400 --> 05:40.880
and gender are invisible to our driving instructor.

05:40.950 --> 05:44.060
You'll each be wearing this heavy yellow fire suit.

05:44.230 --> 05:47.140
you are also will be wearing a balaclava that covers your head

05:47.570 --> 05:50.020
and some mirrored ski goggles.

05:50.860 --> 05:53.730
And finally, the gentlemen out there will be wearing

05:54.400 --> 05:56.390
a pair of fake breasts.

05:57.010 --> 05:58.290
Is everybody ready?

05:58.290 --> 05:59.580
- Yes. - Okay, great.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.980
It may seem odd that we're making people

06:02.320 --> 06:05.090
wear balaclave and men wear these things,

06:05.100 --> 06:06.720
but this is why we're doing it.

06:06.980 --> 06:11.020
In theory, inspector Jack could be effected by people's gender

06:11.020 --> 06:12.270
and mark them differently.

06:12.270 --> 06:14.120
So by making them look all the same,

06:14.120 --> 06:15.300
and not letting them talk,

06:15.730 --> 06:17.660
we are removing any chance of bias.

06:18.290 --> 06:19.590
Plus, it's funny.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.910
But before contestant number one drives away,

06:23.430 --> 06:25.640
Adam adds one more ingredient.

06:25.650 --> 06:26.860
Don't forget to buckle up.

06:27.490 --> 06:30.140
There's a magic interesting moment of getting driving tests.

06:30.330 --> 06:32.000
And most people, if you ask them, tell you that they think

06:32.250 --> 06:35.250
men break the speed limit, more than women, and drive faster.

06:35.620 --> 06:37.420
Are men breaking the speed limit on our course

06:37.420 --> 06:40.320
when we told them all clearly that the speed limit is 25 miles per hour?

06:40.660 --> 06:42.710
This little black box is going to tell us.

06:42.730 --> 06:45.240
Inside it is a piece of proprietary hardware.

06:45.470 --> 06:48.890
If anybody breaks the speed limit of 25 miles per hour during the test,

06:49.520 --> 06:50.600
we're going to know about it.

06:50.890 --> 06:52.430
With the black box in place

06:52.570 --> 06:55.860
and some convenient rain to make things that little bit harder,

06:56.020 --> 06:57.640
cue volunteer No.1.

06:58.260 --> 07:02.210
3, 2, 1, go.

07:05.230 --> 07:06.430
Look at the green light.

07:06.580 --> 07:08.970
First up is accident aviodance.

07:09.760 --> 07:11.420
That seemed to go fairly smoothly.

07:12.290 --> 07:14.420
Then it is onto the close quarter turns,

07:14.420 --> 07:17.760
where a nudged cone breaks Adam's self-restraint.

07:18.480 --> 07:21.680
Our driving instructor Jack has no idea of the gender of this driver.

07:22.030 --> 07:24.120
But I can tell from the way they're driving, it's probably a woman.

07:24.920 --> 07:26.900
I am totally kidding. I have no idea.

07:28.200 --> 07:30.100
It is a woman.  Okay, I'm really sorry.

07:30.100 --> 07:31.710
Cause I didn't know that it was a woman when I said that.

07:31.710 --> 07:32.980
I was just making a terrible joke.

07:34.270 --> 07:35.730
She seems to be doing just fine.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.610
Actually, she's doing better than fine,

07:38.660 --> 07:41.030
because she sails through the rest of the course.

07:41.930 --> 07:44.280
This might be the hardest part of the test

07:44.490 --> 07:46.130
The reverse slalom.

07:46.880 --> 07:48.730
Without any more mistakes,

07:49.210 --> 07:51.550
and while she did break the speed limit,

07:51.550 --> 07:53.130
hitting 27 miles an hour.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.030
She comes away with a score of 88.

07:56.190 --> 07:57.420
Um, finished.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.120
Volunteer number two is a man.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.680
3, 2, 1. Go.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.490
Not that you can know.

08:06.110 --> 08:09.640
I think my disguise is working because that was a guy,

08:10.140 --> 08:11.160
and I really couldn't tell.

08:11.800 --> 08:13.480
And like his female counterpart,

08:13.480 --> 08:15.290
he breezes through the course.

08:16.610 --> 08:17.880
Looks like a good parallel park.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.420
with speed-

08:20.420 --> 08:21.690
Oh, slow down there cowboy.

08:21.690 --> 08:23.120
his only penalty.

08:23.970 --> 08:24.890
Right on the money.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.440
Volunteer three is also a man.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.270
Go.

08:28.990 --> 08:32.120
And despite a good start on the accident avoidance test.

08:32.720 --> 08:33.730
Nice one.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.880
It's not long since things start to go belly up.

08:37.289 --> 08:39.559
Oh, that didn't look good.

08:40.270 --> 08:42.840
It's worth noting this guy is not a novice driver.

08:43.270 --> 08:45.740
We selected them based on a couple of criteria.

08:45.860 --> 08:47.650
First is that, they have to have had

08:47.910 --> 08:50.150
more than five years of driving experience.

08:50.150 --> 08:53.010
The second one is that they can't be pros.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.830
We're looking for the average Joe.

08:55.230 --> 08:58.140
But this guy, he's just a bad driver.

08:58.140 --> 08:59.370
Ain't that the truth.

08:59.910 --> 09:03.190
After knocking over a cornucopia of cones,

09:03.200 --> 09:06.440
and reaching a speed of 29 miles per hour.

09:06.440 --> 09:09.650
This guy scraps in with a score of 54.

09:09.660 --> 09:11.020
One, go.

09:11.100 --> 09:14.060
And when the next woman scores an impressive 82,

09:15.680 --> 09:16.530
Better than me.

09:17.290 --> 09:19.540
in this first battle of the sexes,

09:19.640 --> 09:21.580
the men have their backs to the wall.

09:21.990 --> 09:23.400
Coming next on Mythbusters,

09:23.630 --> 09:24.000
Afraid.

09:24.560 --> 09:28.130
Jamie's human emotion firmware requires an upgrade.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.090
The "Mythbusters" are tackling five of the most

09:37.570 --> 09:41.280
contentious conflicts in the history of the battle of the sexes.

09:42.720 --> 09:45.330
And first up for Kari, Grant and Tory,

09:45.330 --> 09:46.110
it's all in the eyes.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.060
So, we are testing the myth that

09:49.300 --> 09:52.100
women are better at reading people's emotions than men.

09:52.130 --> 09:53.160
Oh, this one is definitely ture.

09:53.320 --> 09:54.910
I don't know, I think I am pretty good at it.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.240
Well, there's a standard way to test this.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.550
You take photos of people with emotions,

09:59.560 --> 10:01.580
and show people just the eyes,

10:01.650 --> 10:04.950
see if they can tell which emotion that person has emitted,

10:04.960 --> 10:07.390
like anger, happiness, sadness, fear.

10:07.540 --> 10:08.070
Perfect.

10:08.070 --> 10:10.440
Let's take pictures of all five Mythbuster hosts

10:10.760 --> 10:12.480
making different emotive faces.

10:12.480 --> 10:13.420
Block everything but the eyes,

10:13.680 --> 10:16.470
and see who can tell what's going on better, men or women.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.900
Now, for this, we have got this photo booth here.

10:19.940 --> 10:23.280
All five "Mythbusters" are gonna jump in here and channel five emotions.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.950
Okay, here we go.

10:25.100 --> 10:25.860
Happy.

10:26.850 --> 10:30.040
Happiness, sadness, anger, fear, confusion.

10:30.730 --> 10:32.080
We're going to take those pictures,

10:32.120 --> 10:33.480
and cut off just the eyes.

10:33.480 --> 10:34.850
Put those in front of men and women,

10:34.980 --> 10:35.840
see if they can figure out

10:35.890 --> 10:38.250
what emotion that we're trying to channel.

10:38.990 --> 10:42.090
Unfortunately, there is an issue with one of the hosts.

10:42.160 --> 10:45.620
Apparently I'm supposed to express a bunch of emotions, happy.

10:46.060 --> 10:49.460
Unfortunately, what you see is what you get, sad.

10:50.260 --> 10:54.450
I mean, I can distort my face in some kind of mimicry of

10:54.450 --> 10:56.250
what I understand is that emotion.

10:56.390 --> 10:59.970
Confused. That's about the best I can do.

11:01.030 --> 11:03.320
So unfortunately because these are all the same,

11:03.840 --> 11:04.870
we have to throw him out.

11:05.270 --> 11:07.750
So, the team has the five emotional photos

11:07.750 --> 11:09.450
of the four human hosts.

11:09.460 --> 11:10.390
What next?

11:11.340 --> 11:13.410
We bring in volunteers one by one,

11:13.620 --> 11:15.280
project the pictures on our screen,

11:15.280 --> 11:17.440
and see who is better at reading emotions,

11:17.450 --> 11:18.730
men or women.

11:19.310 --> 11:21.660
Cue the first male test subject.

11:21.690 --> 11:23.700
And after Grant explains the setup,

11:23.710 --> 11:24.850
it's down to business.

11:25.590 --> 11:27.060
Ok, here is the first slide.

11:28.310 --> 11:31.260
Looks like he is kind of anxious.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.670
John answered anxious.

11:32.930 --> 11:34.010
Correct answer here.

11:36.580 --> 11:39.390
Not a great start, but he does get a few correct,

11:39.390 --> 11:40.380
Fear.

11:40.450 --> 11:41.130
Fear.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.730
and ends up with a reasonable score.

11:43.180 --> 11:46.940
Out of a totall possible 17 emotions, you got 11.

11:47.090 --> 11:48.280
That's pretty good.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.810
We won't know how good until we have a comparison.

11:51.030 --> 11:52.390
Cue the first female.

11:52.390 --> 11:53.040
Happy?

11:53.370 --> 11:53.870
Correct.

11:53.920 --> 11:57.440
And from the getgo, it's clear her answers are faster.

11:57.440 --> 11:58.200
Scared.

11:58.520 --> 11:59.490
More instinctive.

11:59.490 --> 12:00.250
Confused.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.480
And more assured.

12:01.560 --> 12:02.230
Angry.

12:03.470 --> 12:04.180
Sad?

12:05.640 --> 12:06.520
Oh, my god.

12:06.930 --> 12:08.890
Go ladies, go ladies.

12:08.890 --> 12:11.930
However, she does get four answers incorrect.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.100
So it's not a complete wash for the guys.

12:14.110 --> 12:17.600
- 13 points.  - 13, that's really really good.

12:17.600 --> 12:19.690
What we do know is we started strong.

12:20.130 --> 12:22.470
And the next few subjects record lower scores.

12:22.470 --> 12:24.300
You have a score of 8 points.

12:24.390 --> 12:25.940
It's clearly a tough test.

12:25.940 --> 12:26.680
6.

12:26.970 --> 12:28.100
Six? I got five.

12:28.420 --> 12:30.010
But as the data is gathered,

12:30.210 --> 12:32.760
You got a score of ten points, well done.

12:32.760 --> 12:34.270
one trend continues:

12:34.450 --> 12:37.300
the responds time for the women is markedly quicker.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.040
Happy.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.110
Correct.

12:39.110 --> 12:42.440
The women have been very quick to look at the picture

12:42.440 --> 12:44.400
and come up with an answer right away,

12:44.600 --> 12:45.900
whereas the men in general

12:45.900 --> 12:49.270
have had a longer pause between answering.

12:50.630 --> 12:51.430
Anger.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.460
- Yes  - Very good.

12:53.520 --> 12:54.340
Nice work.

12:54.940 --> 12:58.430
As the final few test subjects deliver their emotional verdicts,

12:58.580 --> 13:00.000
the main pattern emerging

13:00.250 --> 13:02.480
is that not only are the women faster,

13:02.480 --> 13:04.420
they're also more accurate.

13:04.610 --> 13:07.670
All right, Kari, this is it. The end of the final experiment.

13:07.850 --> 13:08.730
What are the results?

13:08.930 --> 13:12.030
Okay. So taking the average of the men,

13:12.200 --> 13:14.850
we come up with the score of 9.6.

13:14.870 --> 13:16.320
Alright, pretty good score for the men.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.580
And the average for the women is

13:20.230 --> 13:21.680
10.6
10.6.

13:21.830 --> 13:23.350
So, looks like this is confirmed.

13:23.740 --> 13:25.980
Women are better at reading emotions than men.

13:26.150 --> 13:28.370
Yeah, not a landslide, but still confirmed.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.470
Confirmed.

13:29.470 --> 13:30.220
That's cool.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.870
So it is first blood to the winner.

13:37.170 --> 13:39.140
But with four myths still in the balance,

13:39.140 --> 13:40.510
it is all the play for.

13:44.160 --> 13:47.910
Is it really true that men make for better drivers than women.

13:48.100 --> 13:49.130
Look out for the truck.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.400
- What truck?  - Behind the bus.

13:51.800 --> 13:52.580
What bus?

13:53.510 --> 13:56.970
Well, not if the second secret male was anything to go by.

13:56.970 --> 13:59.280
Oh, that didn't look good.

13:59.820 --> 14:01.380
But six tests later,

14:01.380 --> 14:03.970
Go, go, go, go.

14:05.610 --> 14:06.770
and it's all changed,

14:06.790 --> 14:09.110
because three women have struggled

14:10.200 --> 14:12.980
while three men have passed with flying colors,

14:13.690 --> 14:16.920
meaning the average scores are now 80 for the guys,

14:17.260 --> 14:18.630
and 70 for the gals.

14:18.630 --> 14:22.900
In 3, 2, 1. Go.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.600
There's a lever down there for the parking brake

14:28.600 --> 14:30.440
right below the dash, just kind of pull it.

14:30.850 --> 14:31.640
There you go.

14:33.080 --> 14:35.320
Not a good sign when you leave the parking brake on.

14:36.290 --> 14:37.430
The rest of the afternoon

14:37.630 --> 14:41.630
speeds by in a blur of swerves, squeals-

14:42.830 --> 14:44.570
Just from the sound of acceleration there,

14:44.590 --> 14:46.430
I am going out on a limb saying that's a dude.

14:47.030 --> 14:47.870
twists,

14:49.270 --> 14:50.140
and turns.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.400
That contestant was a little vigorous.

14:52.910 --> 14:55.370
And what's suprsing is the speed data.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.820
Now we're on the last contestant.

14:58.820 --> 15:00.070
Before we crunch all of the numbers,

15:00.210 --> 15:02.720
we have in fact teased out an interesting fact.

15:02.950 --> 15:04.810
You may or may not ascribe to the belief

15:04.850 --> 15:07.490
that men break the speed limit more than women.

15:07.890 --> 15:09.820
And that's why we set a speed limit of

15:09.820 --> 15:11.370
25 miles an hour on this course

15:11.480 --> 15:13.300
trying fairy out wether or not that was true.

15:13.980 --> 15:17.650
What we found is that seven out of nine male drivers

15:17.650 --> 15:19.510
have gone over 25 miles an hour,

15:19.990 --> 15:24.410
but nine out of ten of the female drivers have done the same.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.500
Thus, even if this guy behind me

15:26.760 --> 15:28.250
goes over 25 miles an hour,

15:28.630 --> 15:31.430
the idea that men break the speed more than women is busted.

15:32.050 --> 15:35.250
It is a confounding result that's made more surprising

15:35.390 --> 15:37.920
when guy-ten stays under the limit.

15:38.610 --> 15:39.830
And they are finish.

15:40.760 --> 15:43.240
But what about the overall score results?

15:43.400 --> 15:46.450
Well, after some quick number crunching, the data is in.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.260
All right, dude, I'm dying to know.

15:48.390 --> 15:50.450
What's the final tally that our number is give us.

15:50.740 --> 15:52.520
Are men better drivers than women?

15:52.660 --> 15:55.350
Well, for a while there the men had a strong lead,

15:55.470 --> 15:56.690
but by the end of the test,

15:56.690 --> 15:58.000
the women started to catch up.

15:58.590 --> 15:59.940
They still didn't make it, though,

16:00.030 --> 16:03.460
and the men won fair and square by about 8%.

16:04.690 --> 16:07.750
I did not expect to get such a clear result.

16:07.850 --> 16:09.310
Well, shall we head back home,

16:09.560 --> 16:10.900
and start answering the angry e-mails now?

16:11.420 --> 16:12.370
What are you going to do.

16:21.350 --> 16:22.760
Controversial or not,

16:22.760 --> 16:26.190
the scoreboard tells the tale. It is now all square.

16:26.410 --> 16:27.410
Next!

16:27.640 --> 16:28.740
On Mythbusters,

16:28.880 --> 16:29.550
It's primal.

16:29.550 --> 16:32.260
Do the guys really grill better than their gals?

16:36.810 --> 16:39.850
Up next, the competition is about to heat up.

16:41.860 --> 16:43.710
This one is going to be controversial.

16:44.320 --> 16:46.600
Who is better at grilling, men or women?

16:46.890 --> 16:48.440
Well, in this country at least,

16:48.440 --> 16:50.540
there's absolutely a cultral bias that

16:50.540 --> 16:53.180
outdoor grill is a men's domain.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.970
On the other hand, at least at home,

16:55.130 --> 16:57.570
the stereotype is that women do most of the cooking,

16:57.570 --> 17:01.030
and makes sense that that experience will translate to the grill.

17:01.210 --> 17:02.680
Well, sounds like we got a test.

17:02.690 --> 17:03.360
Perfect.

17:04.230 --> 17:06.470
Since the proverbial cave man

17:06.579 --> 17:08.460
first rubbed two sticks together,

17:08.710 --> 17:11.700
men have perceived fire as their domain.

17:11.869 --> 17:14.270
But are they actually better at cooking on it

17:14.359 --> 17:17.890
or is it another in a long list of self delusions?

17:18.069 --> 17:19.060
To find out,

17:19.210 --> 17:20.890
as our Australian friends would say,

17:20.940 --> 17:23.109
it's time to fire up the body.

17:23.180 --> 17:24.180
This is our grill lab.

17:24.220 --> 17:26.440
We got four identical cooking stations,

17:26.440 --> 17:28.099
ten men, ten women.

17:28.329 --> 17:30.030
And they'll each be given one hour

17:30.030 --> 17:31.960
to do the best job they can at grilling.

17:32.580 --> 17:34.560
Each will be given the exact same number of ingredients

17:34.800 --> 17:37.110
and asked to grill four separate things.

17:37.130 --> 17:39.080
Vegetables, a chicken drum stick,

17:39.150 --> 17:41.730
a hamburger medium rare and a steak medium rare.

17:42.290 --> 17:44.830
The grilling will be assessed by a panel of judges.

17:45.050 --> 17:46.660
This is a blind test which means

17:46.660 --> 17:49.210
the judges will not know the gender of the people

17:49.220 --> 17:50.990
that are preparing the food they're tasting.

17:51.680 --> 17:55.640
Every piece of food will be assessed on three basic criteria.

17:55.870 --> 17:59.580
Presentation, texture, and most importantly, taste.

17:59.990 --> 18:00.800
Shall we start?

18:00.860 --> 18:01.600
Let's bring it on.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.330
Awesome.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.870
And the starting point is control.

18:05.330 --> 18:07.150
Give it a nice color finish.

18:07.150 --> 18:08.590
Barbeque Hall of Famer

18:08.650 --> 18:12.290
and guest judge Rick Gilbert prepares the four item menu

18:12.440 --> 18:15.690
in order to give Adam and Jamie a perfect benchmark

18:15.720 --> 18:18.650
in presentation, texture, and taste.

18:18.650 --> 18:20.660
One thing people commonly do with burgers is that

18:20.660 --> 18:22.320
they will take them, flip them over,

18:22.320 --> 18:23.500
and give them that a little squish.

18:23.860 --> 18:24.690
You don't want to do that.

18:24.730 --> 18:26.060
It just moves the juices right out of the burger

18:26.380 --> 18:27.810
and now that your mouth will never hit it.

18:28.480 --> 18:29.300
Not worth it.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.870
But aside from general tips on great grilling,

18:32.210 --> 18:34.250
there are a few hard and fast rules.

18:35.240 --> 18:36.800
Some things about grilling are subjective,

18:36.800 --> 18:38.350
like appearance or seasoning.

18:38.590 --> 18:41.030
But there's one big area of don't,

18:41.050 --> 18:42.830
and that's over or undercooking.

18:42.880 --> 18:45.360
With all types of food that you put on the grill,

18:45.360 --> 18:46.460
if you overcook them,

18:46.730 --> 18:48.570
they're gonna be dried out and flavorless.

18:48.620 --> 18:50.900
If you undercook them, they're going to be raw.

18:51.140 --> 18:52.130
In the case of chicken,

18:52.450 --> 18:54.020
raw means you simply can't eat it.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.810
Which means it is time to get grilling.

18:57.060 --> 18:59.530
Cue our first set of willing lab rats.

19:00.020 --> 19:02.250
Organized into random groups of four,

19:02.340 --> 19:03.970
they'll cook for the allotted hour.

19:04.420 --> 19:07.100
The judges will then be presented with four dishes.

19:07.140 --> 19:10.160
mixed vegetables, chicken, steak and a burger,

19:10.280 --> 19:12.370
without knowing the sex of the chef.

19:13.010 --> 19:15.620
But Jamie thinks the men will come out on time.

19:17.050 --> 19:18.660
It's kind of makes sense that men would be into grilling.

19:18.860 --> 19:22.360
It involves fire, big slabs of meat, it is primal.

19:22.440 --> 19:26.050
Let's find out. It's time to get to eating and judging.

19:26.180 --> 19:28.250
Alrighty. Contestant number one.

19:28.740 --> 19:30.070
I would call that well done.

19:30.610 --> 19:33.400
The panel tuck in and assess each dish.

19:33.470 --> 19:34.330
That is not bad.

19:34.550 --> 19:37.860
Their comprehensive system scores each of the four dishes

19:37.920 --> 19:41.290
in the three categories with the maximum score of 100.

19:42.010 --> 19:43.050
I say that's a good steak.

19:43.320 --> 19:44.400
That's largely in charge.

19:44.590 --> 19:45.460
Absolutely.

19:45.560 --> 19:49.760
And the first male test subject racks up a solid 51.3.

19:50.740 --> 19:53.990
Our mark on our first female chef fails to match.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.220
That's like the burger I used to fear that my mom would make.

19:57.760 --> 19:58.710
A little bit dry?

19:58.900 --> 20:00.500
Totally dry.

20:00.500 --> 20:02.700
However, the advantage doesn't last

20:02.750 --> 20:05.960
because the next guy severely compromises his score

20:06.300 --> 20:09.130
by failing one of the four dishes completely.

20:10.520 --> 20:12.590
Oh, dudes, I think we may have the first zero

20:12.590 --> 20:13.620
in the meat category.

20:13.790 --> 20:15.640
That's rare.

20:16.100 --> 20:18.000
This here is four burgers,

20:18.050 --> 20:20.350
each burnt crispy on the outside

20:20.350 --> 20:23.700
and totally red red raw on the inside.

20:23.700 --> 20:24.820
We can't even eat these.

20:25.200 --> 20:27.180
It's an automatic zero. I am sorry.

20:27.980 --> 20:28.940
I'd eat it.

20:30.550 --> 20:31.410
Next!

20:31.750 --> 20:34.920
With the next female chef serving up the perfect burger,

20:35.040 --> 20:38.400
That's the perfect color. Little juice in there.

20:38.450 --> 20:42.950
she nails an impressive and so far top scoring 62.4.

20:43.190 --> 20:44.370
And it's game on.

20:44.370 --> 20:45.340
Next!

20:45.510 --> 20:49.460
As Adam Jamie and Rick chow down and churn out the scores

20:49.830 --> 20:51.190
and several things become clear.

20:51.190 --> 20:53.150
That is a darn tasty burger.

20:53.440 --> 20:56.510
First, the quality of the dishes delivered to the judging table

20:56.510 --> 20:57.830
varies hugely.

20:58.050 --> 20:59.900
There is a terrible thing to do with the steak.

20:59.900 --> 21:02.550
Second, are the test object freely acknowledge

21:02.550 --> 21:04.050
the basis of the myth,

21:04.050 --> 21:06.650
men do see the grill more often.

21:06.650 --> 21:08.930
Certainly for me, my friends and my family,

21:08.930 --> 21:11.200
the men do a lot more cooking than the women did.

21:11.210 --> 21:12.350
Yeah, I grill a lot.

21:12.350 --> 21:15.000
But I would say that my boy friend grills better than me.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.520
He cooks it more often, and he gets the meal done

21:17.520 --> 21:19.420
more percise than I do.

21:21.230 --> 21:24.320
Third, as the final meals are tasted and judged,

21:25.820 --> 21:28.260
That's not even questionable. That's just raw.

21:28.270 --> 21:30.750
that additional grill experience

21:30.750 --> 21:33.230
the men have is not reflected in the scores.

21:33.230 --> 21:35.640
This person doesn't seem to have cooked before.

21:36.870 --> 21:37.860
Burger for burger...

21:37.870 --> 21:40.170
This is like a hamburger cooked by a vegetarian. Right here.

21:40.170 --> 21:41.620
steak for steak--

21:41.630 --> 21:44.230
That's an example of what a good steak is.

21:44.230 --> 21:46.370
the women are matching the men.

21:46.370 --> 21:48.200
That was delicious. Want to try some?

21:48.640 --> 21:51.870
Ah, you can't. We're on TV. Sorry.

21:52.020 --> 21:53.510
Rick, thanks so much for your help.

21:53.510 --> 21:54.990
Pleasure. Thank you very much.

21:54.990 --> 21:57.050
And with that, the last score was tallied and totalled.

21:57.050 --> 21:59.620
And it is results time.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.170
Pretty tasty?

22:03.470 --> 22:06.670
Some of it was, some of it I might not feed to my dog.

22:06.790 --> 22:08.040
What you think of the numbers?

22:08.040 --> 22:10.150
The best score was had by men,

22:10.150 --> 22:12.540
but then so was the lowest score.

22:12.540 --> 22:14.170
Right. Women came in with an average score of 42,

22:14.170 --> 22:18.540
men with an average of 46. That's mighty close.

22:18.540 --> 22:19.710
That's close enough to mean that

22:19.710 --> 22:21.610
there wasn't statistical difference.

22:21.610 --> 22:23.340
Which means of course the myth that

22:23.340 --> 22:25.360
men are definitely better than women in grilling

22:25.430 --> 22:26.790
is totally busted.

22:26.790 --> 22:28.590
Based on that test, it is busted.

22:33.480 --> 22:38.610
So while the fire may well bring out the primeval urging men,

22:38.610 --> 22:39.890
but they're no better than women

22:39.990 --> 22:43.730
when it comes the cooking on it.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.750
Do not try what you're about to see at home.

22:47.750 --> 22:50.980
We are what you call experts.

22:52.350 --> 22:56.470
Next up for Kari, Grant and Tory, is the fight of navigators.

22:56.710 --> 23:00.270
OK, Next myth, men are better at navigating than women.

23:00.270 --> 23:02.540
What? I'm a great navigator.

23:03.110 --> 23:07.060
Apparently there's enough controversy that we need to test this myth.

23:07.060 --> 23:09.500
What if we set up a scenario as if we were showed first.

23:09.500 --> 23:12.060
We give a group of men, and a group of women a map.

23:12.060 --> 23:14.910
And they have to take us from point A to point B.

23:14.910 --> 23:16.660
We score them on who takes the shortest path,

23:16.940 --> 23:19.660
but penalize them for lanky stops,

23:19.660 --> 23:22.210
wrong turns, or get panicky directions.

23:22.210 --> 23:23.530
I like it.

23:26.720 --> 23:29.330
To find out if men make for better map readers,

23:29.330 --> 23:31.550
the guys hid the road in style

23:32.170 --> 23:34.400
I'm pretty sure I have no idea where we are.

23:34.400 --> 23:36.490
before cruising down to the coast,

23:36.490 --> 23:38.990
the start point for their map mayhem.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.850
Nice location?

23:43.110 --> 23:45.100
The ideal starting point.

23:45.910 --> 23:47.140
We're about to start our experiment

23:47.140 --> 23:48.480
to find out if the myth is true

23:48.520 --> 23:50.450
that men are better navigators than women.

23:50.450 --> 23:52.180
So, this is the plan.

23:52.190 --> 23:54.430
We have 20 volunteers, 10 men, 10 women.

23:57.150 --> 23:58.830
We are arming them only with a map

23:58.830 --> 24:01.750
with our begining and ending points marked out.

24:01.750 --> 24:03.380
Your map, your map.

24:03.380 --> 24:05.100
Now, they're going to be in the passenger seat,

24:05.100 --> 24:06.810
and Grant is going to drive.

24:06.810 --> 24:09.950
OK, approaching Francisco boulevard, making a right turn.

24:09.960 --> 24:11.430
They are gonna have to navigate us

24:11.430 --> 24:14.000
from the start to finish completely with the map,

24:14.000 --> 24:15.870
no smartphones or GPS.

24:15.880 --> 24:18.350
Now, Tory and I will in the back seat with the score card.

24:18.350 --> 24:20.080
We are going to penalize them for panicky directions,

24:20.080 --> 24:22.460
unnecessary turns--

24:22.460 --> 24:24.600
OK, executing the U-turn.

24:25.040 --> 24:27.060
stopping for no reason

24:27.060 --> 24:29.430
and we also going to penalize them for every half mile

24:29.430 --> 24:31.150
over the minimum distance it takes

24:31.150 --> 24:32.510
to get from point A to point B.

24:32.510 --> 24:34.660
That's calculated about eight miles.

24:34.660 --> 24:36.100
So, this should be a tricky test.

24:36.100 --> 24:37.760
I'm looking forward to seeing the results.

24:39.380 --> 24:41.880
Indeed, at the addition to our volunteers

24:41.880 --> 24:44.500
being completely unfamiliar with the area,

24:44.500 --> 24:46.440
the test is going to be a tough one

24:46.440 --> 24:48.190
as the chosen of the point B

24:48.190 --> 24:51.150
is decidedly difficult to find.

24:51.250 --> 24:53.200
Most of the time when you go on a road trip

24:53.200 --> 24:55.050
with your buddies, you're going somewhere fun.

24:55.060 --> 24:58.630
Not on "Mythbusters." Here, we go to the water treatment plant.

24:58.630 --> 25:01.740
Now, we are nostalgic because we do busting here,

25:04.690 --> 25:08.340
but more importantly, it is hard to find on the map,

25:08.350 --> 25:09.580
not many people know where it is.

25:09.580 --> 25:11.530
It is almost exactly eight miles

25:11.530 --> 25:13.300
from our start point in Pacifica,

25:13.300 --> 25:15.640
and there are many different ways to get here.

25:15.740 --> 25:19.040
Remember, the challenge is to get from A to B,

25:19.180 --> 25:20.790
via the most direct route.

25:20.790 --> 25:23.290
but with dozens of other potencial plots

25:23.290 --> 25:26.250
and a dastardly one way system to boot,

25:26.260 --> 25:28.300
there's a lot that could go wrong.

25:28.300 --> 25:31.330
So, with drivers and scorers sitting pretty,

25:31.330 --> 25:33.240
let the battle commence.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.180
And first up is Agelina.

25:35.180 --> 25:37.310
This is where we are.

25:37.310 --> 25:38.740
Oh, my god.

25:38.740 --> 25:40.410
This is where we are going.

25:40.410 --> 25:42.680
Oh, wow. Oh, my god.

25:42.680 --> 25:46.700
Like all contestants, she's allowed to study the map for 5 minutes

25:48.270 --> 25:49.490
The water and...

25:49.490 --> 25:51.040
before the test begins.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.700
I think we should just make a left somewhere.

25:52.700 --> 25:55.310
- All right. - First, possible left, let's go.

25:55.310 --> 25:56.230
Okay.

25:56.230 --> 25:57.700
And like all contestants,

25:57.700 --> 25:59.950
she starts with a score of 100

25:59.950 --> 26:02.650
that will be reduced for every mistake.

26:02.750 --> 26:04.560
Wait. Why didn't you get on the freeway?

26:04.570 --> 26:06.940
And it is not long before those mistakes

26:06.940 --> 26:09.830
as the myth would suggest, start to mount up.

26:13.110 --> 26:16.900
Staright, um...Okay. Keep going. Stay the...

26:16.900 --> 26:20.310
With last minute directions and a general sense of hopelessness,

26:20.310 --> 26:23.300
Angelina does the only sensible thing.

26:23.300 --> 26:24.980
We have to stop somewhere. Stop.

26:24.980 --> 26:26.660
Stopping, stopping.

26:27.160 --> 26:29.630
She pulls over to try to get her bearings.

26:29.740 --> 26:32.370
North Field Road. Was that North Field Road?

26:32.660 --> 26:35.630
Ten minutes later, she thinks she found them.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.530
Oh, it's before. We have to go back.

26:37.530 --> 26:38.420
We have to go back.

26:38.650 --> 26:40.760
Okay. Executing a U-turn.

26:40.760 --> 26:45.690
After a stop and U-turn, her score already dropped to 75.

26:45.690 --> 26:49.860
I could do it. I know it, because I am so close.

26:49.860 --> 26:52.440
But it drops further on stop two.

26:52.440 --> 26:53.950
So this is where...OK, stop.

26:53.950 --> 26:55.470
Stopping.

26:59.180 --> 27:02.170
And further again on U-turn two.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.710
And by stop three.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.640
Stop.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.040
It's fair to say that this isn't going well.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.650
She seems a little stressed out right now.

27:12.650 --> 27:14.900
But after another five minutes pause,

27:14.900 --> 27:17.150
Angelina finally gets back on track.

27:17.150 --> 27:19.170
OMG, it's not looking good for the women.

27:19.520 --> 27:22.190
And while she tries to upper the score

27:22.190 --> 27:24.440
by using her feminine charm,

27:24.440 --> 27:26.720
- You've been driving for a while? - Yes.

27:26.720 --> 27:27.980
You look very young than that.

27:27.980 --> 27:28.620
Oh, I like this.

27:32.100 --> 27:36.170
It is clear that data point one is great news for men.

27:36.210 --> 27:38.450
Angelina, we're here.

27:39.410 --> 27:42.800
You did it in 11.8 miles.

27:42.800 --> 27:45.780
After deductions for stopping to read the map three times,

27:45.780 --> 27:48.720
three unnecessary turns and one panicky direction,

27:48.780 --> 27:53.080
minus five points for every half mile over the minimum,

27:53.080 --> 27:55.540
you got a total score of 25.

27:55.550 --> 27:57.200
Wait. Did he drive well? Because he...

27:57.200 --> 27:59.200
Oh, I see, you gonna blame him.

28:01.540 --> 28:04.020
25 out of a possible 100

28:04.020 --> 28:05.810
is not the start the ladies wanted.

28:05.810 --> 28:08.070
Can man number one do any better?

28:08.070 --> 28:10.470
All right, get in. Here is your map.

28:10.470 --> 28:12.870
Well, in a word, no, because Chris--

28:14.910 --> 28:16.890
somehow contrives to

28:16.890 --> 28:19.260
map read less well than Angelina.

28:19.260 --> 28:23.520
Not only does he stop once and U-turn twice,

28:23.520 --> 28:26.930
he also gets told to back off by a security guard.

28:28.360 --> 28:30.060
Sir you can't stop here.

28:30.060 --> 28:33.650
Okay. Do you know where the sweage treatment plant is?

28:33.850 --> 28:35.830
I'm sorry. Please move along.

28:36.690 --> 28:40.140
In that case, I think we keep going, bust a U-turn.

28:40.140 --> 28:43.350
OK, very good.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.830
But what's really killing Chris's score is his mileage.

28:44.830 --> 28:46.810
I think we're lost, Kari.

28:46.810 --> 28:48.410
OK, I think you are probably right.

28:49.250 --> 28:51.010
I've never been here before.

28:51.750 --> 28:54.840
Because by the time he finally crushes the finish line,

28:54.840 --> 28:56.990
Congratulations, Chris, you made it.

28:58.300 --> 29:01.670
he's traveled a staggering 13.9 miles.

29:01.670 --> 29:05.180
75% further than the shortest route.

29:05.490 --> 29:09.370
So Chris just finished up and came away with a whopping 20 points.

29:09.510 --> 29:10.460
20 points.

29:10.490 --> 29:12.260
I think he was more concerned about his hair

29:12.260 --> 29:14.370
than he was get into the final destination.

29:14.370 --> 29:16.740
It's a dismal start for either sex.

29:16.740 --> 29:19.240
But with 18 volunteers still to go,

29:19.240 --> 29:21.620
the result is a long way off.

29:21.740 --> 29:23.050
Next on Mythbusters,

29:23.050 --> 29:25.610
are men better at packing a car than women?

29:29.630 --> 29:31.810
Get set for all out war.

29:31.810 --> 29:36.100
Because, the next battle of the sexes is controversial for sure.

29:36.730 --> 29:37.610
What's next?

29:37.610 --> 29:38.940
Packing the car.

29:38.940 --> 29:40.700
You mean like to ship it?

29:40.940 --> 29:42.550
No. For road trip,

29:42.550 --> 29:43.750
you ever take a road trip?

29:43.750 --> 29:44.980
No.

29:45.120 --> 29:47.020
OK, suffice it to say, there's a myth out there

29:47.020 --> 29:50.390
that when packing for a road trip, men are better at it than women.

29:50.400 --> 29:51.640
And I think all we need to do is

29:51.640 --> 29:54.480
prepare for a virtual road trip with slightly more luggage

29:54.480 --> 29:56.110
than you can fit in the average car

29:56.110 --> 29:58.230
and ask a bunch of men and a buch of women to pack it in

29:58.230 --> 30:00.050
and see who wins.

30:00.150 --> 30:02.200
OK, if you say so.

30:04.010 --> 30:06.280
It's a classic gender based cliche

30:06.290 --> 30:08.490
as old as vacations themselves.

30:08.490 --> 30:11.290
Supposedly, as far as loading the luggage goes,

30:11.290 --> 30:12.910
it is a man's world.

30:12.910 --> 30:15.060
But is it really?

30:16.760 --> 30:19.920
Today it is all about spacial awareness,

30:19.930 --> 30:22.460
whether men or women can pack the car

30:22.460 --> 30:23.920
more efficiently than the other sex.

30:23.920 --> 30:25.890
This is one of the test platforms.

30:25.890 --> 30:27.430
That is our other one.

30:27.430 --> 30:28.960
Are we going to get started or what?

30:28.960 --> 30:30.360
Yeah, let's do it.

30:30.790 --> 30:32.850
To deal with, first, they need the luggage,

30:32.850 --> 30:36.770
a complex 28 piece set that Adam and Jamie test load

30:36.770 --> 30:38.370
to make sure it all fenced.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.060
A delicate picture here.

30:40.060 --> 30:42.560
As well as bulky items,

30:42.560 --> 30:44.700
the packers have to secure several fragile items,

30:44.700 --> 30:47.680
like eggs, a cake, and a cream pie,

30:47.680 --> 30:50.110
as well as ensuring the comfort of the doll,

30:50.180 --> 30:52.580
playing the part of a real baby

30:52.580 --> 30:53.950
and three adults.

30:53.950 --> 30:56.950
Then we drive through a predetermined course,

30:56.950 --> 30:59.440
see whether there are any problems

30:59.440 --> 31:01.930
like packages sliding around or things breaking.

31:03.550 --> 31:07.090
With the driving course ready and a packing area built for two.

31:07.090 --> 31:10.600
Because this is a contest, we don't want to allow anybody to

31:10.620 --> 31:13.880
observe anybody else and sort of cheat,

31:13.880 --> 31:15.420
so that's what this screen is about.

31:15.420 --> 31:17.580
Next, we need a scoring system.

31:17.580 --> 31:18.920
May I present your judges,

31:18.920 --> 31:20.190
Ms Kari Byron

31:20.190 --> 31:22.560
and Mr Jamie Franklin Hyneman

31:22.560 --> 31:23.990
If you two would self quest yourselves,

31:23.990 --> 31:25.270
we should start the first test.

31:27.320 --> 31:28.350
Jamie and I are the judges.

31:28.350 --> 31:30.590
We will be scoring at 100 points.

31:30.590 --> 31:33.390
They'll be deductions for the quality of our pack,

31:33.390 --> 31:35.000
depending on the packing of the car,

31:35.000 --> 31:36.610
the volume of the items in there,

31:36.610 --> 31:40.120
the neatness efficiency of the pack, comfortable of the passengers;

31:40.120 --> 31:41.850
Adam will do a quick driving test

31:41.850 --> 31:42.950
to see how things shift around,

31:42.950 --> 31:46.040
and finally there are delicate items in the pack,

31:46.040 --> 31:48.570
eggs, pies, will these things be crushed.

31:48.930 --> 31:51.620
And as the judges, we won't see any of the contestants

31:51.630 --> 31:53.750
but before during or after the test,

31:53.750 --> 31:55.160
so we're not biased.

31:56.690 --> 31:59.450
Cue the first pair of the 20 test subjects.

31:59.450 --> 32:00.760
Rachel and Jeff.

32:00.760 --> 32:04.270
And after given the rules run-down, we're ready to roll.

32:04.340 --> 32:08.430
Packing the car in 3, 2, 1, go.

32:08.690 --> 32:10.410
They're off and run it.

32:10.410 --> 32:12.410
This is all ready. It gonna be cool.

32:12.410 --> 32:14.860
Rachel is opts for speed.

32:14.860 --> 32:17.310
While Jeff is appare to be more methodically in his technique.

32:18.110 --> 32:20.090
It's facinating beat in psychology.

32:20.620 --> 32:23.190
And it is a big load for a small car.

32:25.020 --> 32:27.440
Will either method pay dividends?

32:27.450 --> 32:29.170
Guys have just about 3 minutes left.

32:29.170 --> 32:32.910
Rachel certainly finishes well inside the allotted 15 minutes,

32:34.180 --> 32:35.270
as does Jeff.

32:35.310 --> 32:38.680
And they both managed to squeeze in every item.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.990
That was very, very exciting.

32:40.990 --> 32:42.910
But let's see what the judges have to say.

32:42.910 --> 32:45.370
First up, Rachel's red car attempt

32:45.370 --> 32:46.610
and it's not looking great.

32:46.610 --> 32:49.250
This person actually fit everything in there,

32:49.250 --> 32:52.340
but it is hard to imagine doing

32:52.340 --> 32:55.960
a clutter or sloppier job of doing that.

32:56.090 --> 32:58.980
Despite being her family's designated packer,

32:58.980 --> 33:00.860
even before the drive test,

33:00.860 --> 33:03.460
it is clear Rachel's handling of the delicate items,

33:03.460 --> 33:06.060
like a baby, is a bit of disaster.

33:06.060 --> 33:07.220
You got to be kidding.

33:08.680 --> 33:11.350
I can't hardly tell which end of the kid is up.

33:11.500 --> 33:12.540
Comfort test.

33:12.540 --> 33:15.340
And finally Kari carries out the comfort test.

33:15.340 --> 33:18.150
OK, that's not very cool.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.510
No elbow room, knees hitting here,

33:20.510 --> 33:22.050
luckily I'm small.

33:22.050 --> 33:24.490
The judges are clearly not impressed,

33:24.490 --> 33:27.980
at the scores so far is medi-okey at best.

33:29.200 --> 33:30.680
Going on a road trip.

33:30.680 --> 33:33.550
Let's see how the luggage and passengers survive the drive

33:33.550 --> 33:36.410
both in turns of comfort and breakages.

33:36.410 --> 33:37.670
Adam puts the car

33:37.670 --> 33:41.220
and its precarious packed mode through its passes.

33:41.790 --> 33:46.050
I think I'd went rather better than I imaging, didn't I?

33:46.690 --> 33:48.960
And after the "Mythbusters" family arrives

33:48.960 --> 33:51.930
at the vacation destination, surprisingly--

33:51.930 --> 33:53.180
Eggs are all intact.

33:53.180 --> 33:55.210
The eggs and cake are intact.

33:55.210 --> 33:57.240
However, the baby didn't make it.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.820
Can you believe that you have to specify that it's a delicate item.

33:59.820 --> 34:02.770
Rachel didn't get the women off to a good start.

34:03.670 --> 34:06.450
Jeff on the other hand has done the men proud.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.050
Well I get pictures they're where they wouldn't damaged.

34:09.659 --> 34:12.730
Be scored well on time, efficiency and comfort.

34:12.730 --> 34:14.330
And after the drive test,

34:14.330 --> 34:16.620
all of the fragile items survived.

34:16.920 --> 34:20.199
Not bad. Not bad. The boys are clearly one up.

34:20.210 --> 34:24.340
So far, the myth's destination appears to be confirmed-ville.

34:24.340 --> 34:29.760
Coming up. Battle of the sexes reaches an epic conclusion!

34:37.050 --> 34:38.290
The hippocampus--

34:38.290 --> 34:40.940
an area of the brain the size and shape of a seahorse,

34:40.940 --> 34:43.310
is responsible for emotional memory.

34:43.389 --> 34:45.000
It's significantely bigger in women than men.

34:48.900 --> 34:51.060
In map reading mayhem,

34:51.060 --> 34:53.679
the first female navigator lost her marbles,

34:53.679 --> 34:54.810
as well as her bearings.

34:54.810 --> 34:58.050
We actually had to stop on the side of the road three times.

34:58.050 --> 35:01.870
She had no idea where we were going. We're totally lost.

35:01.870 --> 35:03.220
But there's so much fun.

35:03.220 --> 35:05.740
But the first male did even worse.

35:05.740 --> 35:07.220
He was taking us through neighborhoods.

35:07.220 --> 35:08.540
We were driving down side streets.

35:08.540 --> 35:11.330
We actually pull the map out to see where he was going.

35:11.420 --> 35:13.360
I had no idea where we are at.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.180
Turns out, when we were done,

35:15.180 --> 35:17.000
he went way over the eight mile limit that we are allowed.

35:18.170 --> 35:19.630
So after round one,

35:19.630 --> 35:22.290
it seems that the two sexes are equal.

35:23.280 --> 35:26.000
So cue contestant number 3--Jen.

35:26.150 --> 35:27.730
- Hi, are you Jen? - Yes.

35:27.730 --> 35:29.280
- Ready to navigate for science? - Yes.

35:29.280 --> 35:30.630
Get in.

35:30.690 --> 35:31.880
Here is your map.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.470
Jen studies the map.

35:33.470 --> 35:37.290
Grant resets the odometer and then they all hit the road.

35:37.290 --> 35:40.060
OK Jen, what's my first direction?

35:41.950 --> 35:43.860
This time there's a major difference,

35:43.870 --> 35:46.190
not only does she gives clear instructions,

35:48.280 --> 35:50.940
but she also get all the way to the finish line

35:50.950 --> 35:53.530
with out a singal stop or wrong turn.

35:53.530 --> 35:56.740
Congratulations Jen, you made to the water quality control plant.

35:56.740 --> 35:59.380
However Jen doesn't get a perfect score,

35:59.380 --> 36:01.920
because her choice of the route is not the shortest

36:01.920 --> 36:04.080
You did decide to go the longer route.

36:04.080 --> 36:06.470
We went 11 miles,

36:06.470 --> 36:09.760
that's three miles over the alloted eight mile limit.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.470
So you lose 30 points.

36:12.480 --> 36:15.190
Contestant four is Jeff.

36:15.190 --> 36:17.020
- Hey, there. - Welcome.

36:17.470 --> 36:20.540
And like Jen, he sails through the test with no slipups.

36:22.190 --> 36:23.920
However, unlike Jen,

36:24.000 --> 36:27.670
he also complete the course in the minimum 8 miles.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.870
You got a perfect score.

36:29.870 --> 36:32.800
Not to be outdone, Sherry steps up for the women.

36:32.800 --> 36:35.710
- Jump in. - I'm not ready but I'm jumping in.

36:35.720 --> 36:38.560
And she, too, nails a perfect 100.

36:39.450 --> 36:42.340
So far, the myth is not playing out as expected.

36:42.340 --> 36:43.480
It's neck and neck,

36:43.480 --> 36:46.210
with 15 nevigators still to come.

36:46.220 --> 36:50.240
Everyone, keep your hands and arms inside the vehicle at all times.

36:50.240 --> 36:51.240
Here's your map.

36:51.240 --> 36:53.040
And those 15 follow a similar pattern.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.570
Some people get horribly lost,

36:58.770 --> 37:00.320
others never deviate.

37:00.330 --> 37:02.880
So, at least we're not on the freeway.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.790
And while they nearly all blame their deficiencies

37:05.790 --> 37:07.370
on modern technology,

37:07.370 --> 37:09.930
The map part of the test was pretty difficult,

37:09.930 --> 37:13.200
considering I don't use maps anymore, I use my phone for GPS.

37:13.230 --> 37:15.530
at the end of the tiring afternoon,

37:15.640 --> 37:18.420
the results of all 20 volunteers are in.

37:18.480 --> 37:20.870
So, cue the drum roll.

37:21.430 --> 37:22.770
The results of this myth,

37:22.770 --> 37:24.410
women got a 77 point average,

37:24.410 --> 37:27.580
and men only got a 74 point average.

37:27.580 --> 37:31.090
That means the men are not better map readers than women.

37:31.150 --> 37:32.550
We're equals.

37:32.600 --> 37:34.350
Yet with such a small sample size,

37:34.350 --> 37:37.620
the three point difference is too close to call,

37:37.620 --> 37:40.600
meaning men and women are effectively equal.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.110
Moreover, the way people lost points

37:43.110 --> 37:45.260
through mistake or distance penalties

37:45.260 --> 37:47.860
was also equal at the cross sexs.

37:48.590 --> 37:51.100
Most importantly, this myth is busted.

37:51.100 --> 37:53.110
Men are not better map readers than women.

37:53.110 --> 37:54.690
Busted.

37:54.910 --> 37:56.430
OK, get out here.

37:56.850 --> 37:58.700
Chauffeur!

38:02.360 --> 38:04.460
That's another busted stereotype,

38:04.460 --> 38:07.240
and another example of gender equality.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.930
The result is down to the final test.

38:09.930 --> 38:13.380
Is loading up the luggage is really best left to the boys?

38:14.870 --> 38:17.350
Well, with one pair of test subjects down.

38:17.450 --> 38:18.660
You gotta be kiding.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.410
It's men on top.

38:21.080 --> 38:24.420
The first guy easily outscored our first gal.

38:25.140 --> 38:26.980
I'm loving this test.

38:27.140 --> 38:30.300
But one data point a sample does not make.

38:30.300 --> 38:34.620
Packing in the car in 3, 2, 1, go.

38:34.620 --> 38:37.030
So the second pair of packers get busy,

38:37.030 --> 38:40.050
and Adam struggles with the basic reality.

38:40.560 --> 38:43.780
Watching people solve these problems is just fascinating,

38:43.780 --> 38:46.190
I keep on thinking why are they doing it that way,

38:46.190 --> 38:48.240
then I realize they're not me.

38:48.420 --> 38:50.350
No, and once again,

38:50.350 --> 38:53.290
the female test subject seems to be playing to type.

38:53.290 --> 38:54.560
Stop packing.

38:54.610 --> 38:56.920
Judge Jamie is unimpressed.

38:57.510 --> 38:59.840
That's why the rest of the car was neat.

38:59.850 --> 39:02.470
Because they simply didn't put them all in.

39:03.590 --> 39:05.730
And by the end of the drive,

39:06.000 --> 39:08.430
they had even less than they started with.

39:08.710 --> 39:10.050
Where is the skateboard?

39:10.290 --> 39:11.560
And there it is.

39:12.190 --> 39:15.990
But if girl number two was bad, the guy was even worse.

39:15.990 --> 39:19.480
Really? They forgot the baby? The baby?

39:20.210 --> 39:21.460
Not a great start,

39:21.460 --> 39:24.310
and his score plummets during the drive test.

39:26.870 --> 39:27.970
Bye, doggy.

39:28.580 --> 39:30.630
Loose items prove to be dangerous,

39:30.630 --> 39:32.580
and fragile items prove to be

39:33.080 --> 39:34.080
fragile.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.010
And we stop.

39:37.300 --> 39:40.290
Those series of infractions mean a very low score.

39:40.290 --> 39:43.600
And the accumulative average is now neck and neck

39:43.920 --> 39:44.760
Go.

39:44.760 --> 39:46.850
And so the rest of the day passes.

39:48.440 --> 39:52.480
Adam wheels out success pairs of prospective packers.

39:55.980 --> 39:57.600
And stop!

39:58.320 --> 39:59.570
Are you OK?

39:59.570 --> 40:03.370
But the only pattern to really emerge is the lack of one.

40:04.380 --> 40:06.640
It is funny watching these guys and girls a pack.

40:06.640 --> 40:08.090
That's where you put the cake?

40:08.100 --> 40:10.680
We have 28 different packages, we got two cars.

40:10.680 --> 40:15.400
By my math, 16 gazillion ways to arrange them in the cars.

40:16.190 --> 40:18.080
I can't get my seat belt on.

40:18.670 --> 40:21.760
I have seen things that are egregiouslly ridiculous

40:21.850 --> 40:24.070
in terms of... just awful packing,

40:26.010 --> 40:29.060
and I've seen some lovely elegant solutions.

40:29.100 --> 40:30.380
The full gamp.

40:30.940 --> 40:32.250
It's taken several tests up,

40:32.250 --> 40:35.340
but finally someone has deflated the beach ball

40:35.340 --> 40:38.430
and to get more space. Awesome.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.400
While it's true that the quality

40:40.400 --> 40:43.390
of the individual male and female perfomances

40:43.390 --> 40:45.680
seesaws back and forth.

40:46.550 --> 40:48.680
- Hold on. - Are you OK?

40:48.680 --> 40:53.360
Oh, man, I just whacked myself in the ear with that fishing pull.

40:54.140 --> 40:56.120
Sorry for laughing, but that's funny.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.220
As we approach the last few pairs,

40:58.220 --> 41:01.400
there's one pattern finally emerging.

41:02.780 --> 41:06.570
The men have their noses in front.

41:06.890 --> 41:09.870
The idea that men have better spacien awareness than women

41:09.870 --> 41:11.860
may be a over repeated choke.

41:11.860 --> 41:14.370
It has been shown the brains are wired so differently

41:14.370 --> 41:18.570
and men do parse spacial awareness solutions

41:18.570 --> 41:20.590
slightly faster than women do.

41:20.590 --> 41:24.360
However, that doesn't mean we come to the correct solution

41:24.360 --> 41:26.750
any more than women do.

41:26.750 --> 41:30.120
But, time is a factor in our test, and right now,

41:30.120 --> 41:33.370
looks like are men are winnning, but only just.

41:33.960 --> 41:36.340
I think that's it. Jamie's gonna love this.

41:38.460 --> 41:40.280
Number boy, what did they say.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.230
The numbers are actually quite interesting.

41:42.230 --> 41:48.210
Out of a perfect score, the men scored 51% up, they average 51%.

41:48.280 --> 41:53.300
The women scored 45%, 6% less than men.

41:53.360 --> 41:54.810
Is that significant?

41:55.070 --> 41:58.640
If it's at all significant, I'd say just by a hair.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.780
I think you can call this that the men are better at packing,

42:00.780 --> 42:03.050
but litterally by a nose.

42:09.430 --> 42:11.560
Well, I think we might have actually found something

42:11.560 --> 42:13.910
more controversial than feul efficiency.

42:13.910 --> 42:16.940
You mean like us discovering that men are acturally better drivers.

42:16.940 --> 42:18.970
But they are definitely not better navigators.

42:18.970 --> 42:22.280
Well, there aren't actually any clear winners to the contest, though.

42:22.280 --> 42:24.350
But there were some distinct differences.

42:24.350 --> 42:26.490
We are far from done testing here.

42:26.490 --> 42:29.320
There are endless matter, cliche and stereotypes we can get into.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.090
Absolutly.

42:30.100 --> 42:32.730
So, if you got any gender differences myth you want to test,

42:32.730 --> 42:34.220
send them all in.

42:35.305 --> 42:41.277
