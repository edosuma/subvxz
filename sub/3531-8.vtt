WEBVTT

01:47.984 --> 01:50.195
Them flies are getting thick.

01:51.237 --> 01:53.865
Somebody ought to give you a good hosing.

01:55.033 --> 01:56.951
Heat ain't helping.

01:57.702 --> 02:00.330
Well, reckon you'll keep another day.

02:02.332 --> 02:05.627
Be good, I'll bring you
some more water around noon.

02:07.378 --> 02:09.214
Bye, Daddy.

02:34.614 --> 02:37.492
Okay. Come on.

02:39.369 --> 02:40.411
Come.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.872
<i>What the devil is all this about?</i>

02:42.956 --> 02:44.874
<i>Why was I brought here?</i>

02:45.917 --> 02:48.211
<i>Games? Must we?</i>

02:49.379 --> 02:51.714
<i>Not that I mind a slight case of abduction,</i>

02:51.798 --> 02:54.259
<i>but I have tickets for the theater this evening.</i>

02:54.342 --> 02:56.094
<i>To a show I was looking forward to.</i>

02:56.177 --> 02:58.847
<i>And I get, well, kind of unreasonable
about things like that.</i>

02:58.930 --> 03:02.350
<i>With such expert play-acting,
you make this very room a theater.</i>

03:02.433 --> 03:04.227
You have a good walk?

03:06.145 --> 03:07.605
Yes, my dear.

03:08.189 --> 03:10.108
Top notch walk this morning.

03:12.443 --> 03:14.779
Top notch constitutional.

03:20.118 --> 03:22.787
It's been weeks since I left my mark.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.498
Would that they had eyes to see.

03:26.332 --> 03:29.002
Hey! Don't you get Miss Billy in here
with them dirty feet!

03:37.802 --> 03:39.387
Sorry, old chap.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.824
You wanna make flowers today?

04:02.410 --> 04:03.661
I'm busy.

04:04.203 --> 04:06.623
I have very important work to do.

04:07.373 --> 04:08.499
My

04:09.667 --> 04:12.962
ascension removes me
from the disk and the loop.

04:13.838 --> 04:15.673
I'm near final stage.

04:16.883 --> 04:18.509
Some mornings,

04:19.010 --> 04:21.304
I can see the infernal plane.

04:22.764 --> 04:26.142
You haven't made flowers on me
for maybe three weeks.

04:26.768 --> 04:28.645
Makes me sad, is all.

04:31.189 --> 04:35.318
Come up on me lap, lass. Here.

04:35.401 --> 04:38.613
And let me comfort you in your distress.

04:38.696 --> 04:41.532
You're gonna make fun
of me again.

04:41.616 --> 04:44.410
Now, why would I do
a thing like that?

04:44.494 --> 04:47.372
Is it because you're nay so bright?

04:47.872 --> 04:50.750
Because of your head being so slow and like?

04:51.918 --> 04:55.380
You better let me go,
'cause I'll burn your eggs.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.935
Can you tell me about Grandpa?

05:22.907 --> 05:24.909
I was in the cane fields.

05:26.577 --> 05:28.997
And he caught me when I was alone.

05:29.956 --> 05:32.709
And the dirt was warm.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.920
I felt the dirt warm on my back.

05:56.566 --> 05:59.110
You're gonna lose a kneecap
if I gotta ask you again.

05:59.193 --> 06:02.447
Now take it out of the bag
and put it in the machine.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.636
Don't look at me.

06:26.387 --> 06:27.722
Look at the TV.

06:46.324 --> 06:48.659
Jesus Christ.

06:49.494 --> 06:51.662
Why are you showing me this?

07:02.632 --> 07:05.968
That little girl is the one
you said went to see her daddy,

07:06.052 --> 07:08.513
Marie Fontenot, circa 1990.

07:12.517 --> 07:15.853
I took a "missing juvenile" report.

07:18.064 --> 07:20.525
And when I went back to follow up on it

07:21.275 --> 07:24.320
the file said, "Report made in error."

07:25.530 --> 07:27.240
I never wrote that.

07:28.533 --> 07:31.786
So I marched it right into
the Sheriff, Ted Childress.

07:31.869 --> 07:33.371
He's dead now.

07:33.621 --> 07:34.705
He did it.

07:35.915 --> 07:37.583
What did Sheriff say?

07:37.667 --> 07:39.168
He said he'd changed it.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.963
That he knew the mother and the father.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.923
The aunt and the uncle.

07:44.799 --> 07:47.343
It was a niece once removed from him
or something.

07:48.553 --> 07:51.889
It was a chain of command.
No reason to change it.

07:52.306 --> 07:56.018
I just follow what the big man says.

07:56.644 --> 07:57.854
It's

07:59.272 --> 08:01.023
how this all works.

08:01.482 --> 08:03.985
I tried to get back
with the mother,

08:04.735 --> 08:06.028
I tried to get back with her,

08:06.112 --> 08:08.072
she was gone, she split.

08:08.156 --> 08:09.824
The file was gone.

08:10.283 --> 08:11.576
Nobody said a word.

08:11.659 --> 08:15.830
Later that year, I was in state CID
on Ted's recommendation.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.958
Nobody ever gave me a reason
to second-guess it.

08:19.041 --> 08:20.918
It's chain of command.

08:22.962 --> 08:24.130
Right?

08:27.091 --> 08:28.426
What do you think?

08:29.719 --> 08:31.721
I don't think he's lying.

08:33.598 --> 08:35.308
As far as he knows.

08:35.683 --> 08:37.351
"As far as I know?"

08:37.435 --> 08:39.770
What the fuck is with you, man?

08:40.229 --> 08:43.316
It'll be a whole lot safer
if we staged something, Marty.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.527
Send the Maserati over the guard rail.

09:02.668 --> 09:04.462
Boys, slow down.

09:10.343 --> 09:12.136
Be careful out there.

09:24.106 --> 09:27.151
I can get you a cafeteria lunch
if you're hungry.

09:27.693 --> 09:31.155
That's all right, Miss.
I gotta get on with my work.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.491
Lots to do today.

09:33.574 --> 09:34.575
All right.

09:59.517 --> 10:01.477
We're gonna hang on
to your phone

10:01.560 --> 10:03.271
and your gun till we get safe.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.398
We'll mail them to you once we know we are.

10:05.481 --> 10:06.983
Does that work for you, Steve?

10:07.066 --> 10:09.402
You can bet your ass it doesn't.

10:09.944 --> 10:12.446
And it's Sheriff Geraci to you, shitheel.

10:12.530 --> 10:16.033
Look, Steve, you're gonna wanna
swing some dick on this thing.

10:16.117 --> 10:18.744
I'm gonna give you
a couple reasons why you won't.

10:18.828 --> 10:21.330
First off, we found this tape
in your possession.

10:21.414 --> 10:24.625
It's a video of the little girl
that you said was not missing.

10:24.709 --> 10:27.795
Second off, all findings
are with lawyers ready to be forwarded

10:27.878 --> 10:32.383
to media outlets, Feds, CID, US Attorneys.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.927
Should either one of us get sworn a warrant,

10:35.011 --> 10:37.471
or either one of us just fall off
the face of the fucking Earth,

10:37.555 --> 10:39.765
as people are want to do
in your neck of the woods.

10:39.849 --> 10:42.226
So, just think about that little girl, Steve.

10:46.772 --> 10:48.566
What about your boat?

10:50.860 --> 10:52.570
That ain't my boat.

10:52.653 --> 10:55.781
- You know whose boat that is?
- I've never seen it before.

10:55.865 --> 10:58.659
It's gonna come back on you, you assholes.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.786
One way or another.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.496
You just think about that little girl, Steve.

11:02.580 --> 11:05.708
For quite some time,
I'm gonna be thinking about you, Rust.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.668
Hey, one other thing, Steve.

11:07.752 --> 11:11.589
I got an old sniper pal, all right.
Contract's already been paid.

11:12.340 --> 11:14.342
Me or Marty, we see cuffs or coffins,

11:14.425 --> 11:16.344
you're gonna end up in the dirt.

11:16.427 --> 11:18.220
Then we're gonna smear your name.

11:19.305 --> 11:21.515
I got something coming for you, baby.

11:21.599 --> 11:24.143
Your psycho bit don't cut me, boy.

11:25.144 --> 11:26.562
You hear me?

11:33.986 --> 11:35.404
What the fuck? Hey!

11:44.914 --> 11:48.125
I strike you
as more of a talker or a doer, Steve?

11:48.501 --> 11:50.211
That's my fucking car!

11:50.294 --> 11:51.587
God damn it!

11:51.670 --> 11:53.506
<i>L'chaim,</i> fat-ass.

11:54.840 --> 11:56.509
You motherfuckers!

11:57.551 --> 11:58.803
Fuck you!

12:07.645 --> 12:09.105
That's old Sheriff Childress.

12:09.188 --> 12:12.024
He's got no kids.
No location on any of his relatives.

12:14.151 --> 12:16.153
You think they could
have wiped out birth records?

12:16.237 --> 12:17.655
I don't see why not.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.783
I mean, half those hospitals
along the coast are gone now.

12:22.493 --> 12:23.786
You know,

12:23.994 --> 12:27.289
we got a dead end on the relations

12:27.581 --> 12:29.542
then what else is there?

12:29.708 --> 12:30.918
Case files.

12:31.585 --> 12:33.546
You want pre-'98 or after?

12:34.839 --> 12:36.006
After.

12:38.092 --> 12:40.678
We're going to have to be looking
at these records with fresh eyes, Marty.

12:41.178 --> 12:43.681
All right? Like we're totally green.

13:02.324 --> 13:03.868
Why green ears?

13:05.911 --> 13:08.038
I mean, assuming that's our guy.

13:09.582 --> 13:11.250
I don't know exactly.

13:11.333 --> 13:14.795
My thinking was
it was probably leaves of some kind.

13:15.087 --> 13:18.215
You know, 'cause we do know
that he came at her through the woods.

13:27.266 --> 13:28.684
Why? What are you thinking?

13:29.059 --> 13:34.899
I'm looking for '95 Dora Lange
canvassing photos from Erath.

13:35.316 --> 13:36.400
Why?

13:37.860 --> 13:39.069
Well...

13:58.506 --> 13:59.715
Rust,

14:00.466 --> 14:02.009
come over here.

14:05.137 --> 14:07.431
Now, you think, back then...

14:08.390 --> 14:12.311
Does that look like a fresh paint job to you?

14:18.776 --> 14:21.070
- Green ears.
- Yeah.

14:21.654 --> 14:24.240
Maybe they were sticking out of his hat.

14:24.323 --> 14:26.450
Maybe he painted that house.

14:32.456 --> 14:35.000
I'm going to look up old addressees.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.801
Fuck you, man.

14:57.565 --> 15:00.442
Something has been bugging me
for the last 10 years.

15:00.526 --> 15:03.153
Not every day, just now and then.

15:04.321 --> 15:06.824
When we went at it, the day you quit,

15:08.617 --> 15:10.327
were you holding back?

15:10.828 --> 15:13.163
No, I don't see how I could have.

15:14.290 --> 15:15.791
Yeah, you do.

15:15.958 --> 15:20.838
You've always had such
an inflated idea of yourself.

15:21.213 --> 15:22.506
Meaning what?

15:22.631 --> 15:25.593
Meaning, it seems pretty damn arrogant

15:25.676 --> 15:28.679
to hold back in a fight with me.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.350
You think you could've put me down?

15:34.518 --> 15:37.771
I don't know. Hell, I'd have had to kill you.

15:37.855 --> 15:40.024
And you were so goddamn mad.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.486
Yeah...

15:46.030 --> 15:48.532
You know,
when she told me, she said

15:49.533 --> 15:51.160
not to blame you,

15:51.452 --> 15:54.204
that it wasn't your choice, you were drunk

15:55.205 --> 15:57.082
and she made it happen.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.835
Everybody's got a choice, Marty.

16:00.753 --> 16:02.338
Shit, I sure blamed you.

16:02.421 --> 16:04.340
Blamed me for what?

16:05.049 --> 16:09.345
For pushing a good woman
to the point where she had to use me,

16:09.845 --> 16:12.473
use our partnership to get rid of you.

16:13.057 --> 16:15.809
You were just being a lying sack of shit.

16:17.561 --> 16:20.773
You know, she couldn't have used you
if you didn't want some.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.399
There you go.

16:23.067 --> 16:25.069
Everybody's got a choice.

16:28.072 --> 16:30.616
And yet, she still cares about you.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.328
You went to see her, I take it.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.830
- She came by the bar.
- What?

16:37.164 --> 16:38.165
When?

16:38.248 --> 16:39.917
She was just checking on you,

16:40.000 --> 16:42.586
wanted to make sure
I wasn't getting you in any trouble.

16:42.670 --> 16:44.922
You should've fucking told me.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.383
Maybe. I guess.

16:49.593 --> 16:51.970
I reckoned it was best to just avoid her name.

16:52.054 --> 16:55.307
Didn't want to invite judgment.
You never liked being judged.

16:55.391 --> 16:57.810
No, you're right. I don't. Not by you.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.520
Well, I didn't say a word.

16:59.603 --> 17:01.939
Well, I could read it all over your face.

17:02.022 --> 17:05.567
Well, then your problem
is with your face, not mine.

17:09.446 --> 17:12.282
It's hard to find something in a man

17:12.366 --> 17:15.369
who rejects people as much
as you do, you know that?

17:15.452 --> 17:18.580
I never told you how to live your life, Marty.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.791
No, no, no. You just sat in judgment.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.334
Look, as sentient meat,

17:22.418 --> 17:25.879
however illusory our identities are,

17:25.963 --> 17:29.299
we craft those identities
by making value judgments.

17:29.383 --> 17:31.677
Everybody judges, all the time.

17:32.553 --> 17:34.722
Now, if you got a problem with that,

17:34.805 --> 17:36.432
you're living wrong.

17:41.395 --> 17:43.147
What's scented meat?

18:04.835 --> 18:06.378
Can I help you?

18:07.880 --> 18:09.631
Did you happen
to live here back in '95?

18:09.715 --> 18:11.884
No, we didn't live here back then.

18:11.967 --> 18:13.469
This is my grandma's place.

18:13.969 --> 18:15.429
Your grandma, is she still with us?

18:15.512 --> 18:17.181
- Alive you mean?
- Yeah.

18:17.264 --> 18:20.851
Yeah, she's in an old folks' place, Abbeville.

18:24.438 --> 18:27.524
<i>Mrs. Hill, now,
this is a very strange question,</i>

18:29.568 --> 18:33.739
but do you remember
back in the winter of '94, '95,

18:34.198 --> 18:36.575
did you get your house painted?

18:38.368 --> 18:40.204
I did. Yes, I did.

18:41.121 --> 18:42.581
A nice green.

18:42.664 --> 18:45.459
I don't remember what they call it anymore.

18:45.542 --> 18:49.296
Do you happen to remember
who it was that painted your house?

18:49.379 --> 18:51.048
Well, yes.

18:51.131 --> 18:54.802
I don't remember the name
but they were nice men.

18:54.885 --> 18:58.180
They worked for our parish,
yard work, house painting.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.933
My church, they got a discount.

19:01.016 --> 19:03.769
Good work for fair pay, back then.

19:03.852 --> 19:06.063
Do you remember, by any chance,

19:06.688 --> 19:09.900
names or just any other details?

19:13.070 --> 19:17.991
I remember they charged $250
for the whole house exterior.

19:19.201 --> 19:21.912
And one of the men, the younger one,

19:23.372 --> 19:27.501
he had scarring
all along the bottom of his face.

19:28.919 --> 19:33.006
Ms. Lily, back then,
did you or your husband work?

19:33.090 --> 19:36.009
My husband, Butch, he's always worked.

19:36.468 --> 19:38.929
He was offshore for city services.

19:39.763 --> 19:41.723
- Did he pay his taxes?
- Always.

19:41.807 --> 19:43.517
A lot of good it did him.

19:43.934 --> 19:46.353
Thank you so much.
You've been really helpful.

19:46.436 --> 19:47.604
Thank you.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.191
There you go.

19:51.275 --> 19:54.194
Husband took the write-off December '94.

19:54.278 --> 19:55.988
$265.

19:56.071 --> 19:59.032
Paid by Butch Hill
to Childress and Son Maintenance.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.493
Yes. Yes.

20:01.577 --> 20:02.536
Here we go.

20:02.619 --> 20:08.041
Business license first issued
to Billy Childress 1978.

20:08.125 --> 20:10.627
- Same name as that... Yeah.
- Sheriff.

20:11.795 --> 20:16.717
Okay, business license
not renewed since 2004.

20:20.637 --> 20:23.974
Okay, name comes up a lot in public records.

20:24.308 --> 20:27.311
Looks like they had a lot of parish contracts,

20:28.312 --> 20:30.939
public state property, landscapes...

20:31.023 --> 20:32.900
I want to know where he was.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.067
Okay.

20:37.029 --> 20:38.739
All over the coast.

20:38.822 --> 20:39.948
Okay.

20:40.490 --> 20:45.162
It looks like they did maintenance
for a lot of schools,

20:45.662 --> 20:48.081
playgrounds, cemeteries.

20:48.165 --> 20:50.500
Run a background on Billy Childress,
find his son.

20:50.584 --> 20:52.169
Okay.

20:53.045 --> 20:54.296
Here we go.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.006
William Lee Childress,

20:56.089 --> 20:59.968
born to Lizbeth Childress, 1944, Erath.

21:01.386 --> 21:05.349
<i>No son showing. Address, DMV, old license.</i>

21:05.933 --> 21:08.393
<i>Highway 27, south.</i>

21:24.368 --> 21:25.494
Get out of here!

21:29.414 --> 21:32.084
Can you smell the flowers,
Miss Billy?

21:32.167 --> 21:35.003
One to the Feds, one to state CID,

21:35.087 --> 21:37.839
one to state attorney, one to US attorney.

21:37.923 --> 21:40.926
Two to national papers, two to local papers,

21:41.009 --> 21:42.678
two to national channels.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.348
It's a whole story, near as we got it.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.601
There's a copy of the tape in each one.

21:50.018 --> 21:52.437
The case files and our depositions,

21:53.105 --> 21:54.690
everything we got.

21:55.482 --> 21:59.236
Now, 24 hours passes and I don't stop you,

22:00.028 --> 22:01.697
mail them all out.

22:04.449 --> 22:06.243
Then lay low a while.

22:14.084 --> 22:17.212
How's that case going?
Lake Charles.

22:17.921 --> 22:20.132
None of your fucking business.

22:20.298 --> 22:22.592
Your old partner give you anything yet?

22:22.676 --> 22:24.928
None of your fucking business.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.471
Why did you call me?

22:26.555 --> 22:28.265
Why not my partner?

22:30.183 --> 22:32.352
You I can read, him I can't.

22:32.436 --> 22:34.187
And why would you need to do that?

22:34.688 --> 22:36.690
What have you two been doing?

22:36.773 --> 22:40.235
All those late nights
at your offices the last month?

22:41.778 --> 22:44.781
Christ. So, that's it? That's all you got?

22:44.865 --> 22:46.199
Ain't for you to know.

22:46.283 --> 22:49.411
But I know you've been pulling case files
all over south Louisiana.

22:50.287 --> 22:52.831
It's about Cohle's theory, way back?

22:52.914 --> 22:54.791
He's fucking with you.

22:55.083 --> 22:57.461
He's a manipulator. Sociopath.

22:57.794 --> 22:59.629
You know this.

23:02.299 --> 23:04.718
What do you know about Sam Tuttle?

23:04.801 --> 23:07.095
All the branches of the family?

23:07.554 --> 23:12.601
The marsh cove, devil worship,
child sacrifices?

23:13.685 --> 23:15.479
You sound like Cohle.

23:16.188 --> 23:18.356
It points in every direction but him, huh?

23:18.440 --> 23:19.566
Man, I knew you were gonna say that.

23:19.649 --> 23:21.610
You know something, you're obstructing.

23:21.693 --> 23:23.528
We don't know.

23:23.612 --> 23:27.115
But we're following up an idea.
Maybe nothing.

23:27.199 --> 23:28.867
But, time comes,

23:29.659 --> 23:31.828
we know we got something,

23:32.287 --> 23:34.998
you get a call, you gonna do the right thing?

23:35.582 --> 23:38.251
You're speaking riddles to me, white man.

23:38.335 --> 23:39.544
You sound like Cohle.

23:39.628 --> 23:40.629
Again.

23:40.712 --> 23:45.092
We get something, do you want the call
or you want it to go to someone else?

23:47.469 --> 23:49.096
Give it to me.

23:54.101 --> 23:56.853
Just make sure you come running.

24:36.560 --> 24:37.894
That taste.

24:42.983 --> 24:44.067
What?

24:44.943 --> 24:47.571
Aluminum. Ash.

24:49.406 --> 24:51.283
I've tasted it before.

24:55.871 --> 24:57.914
You still see things ever?

24:58.832 --> 25:00.917
It never stops, not really.

25:01.585 --> 25:05.463
What happened to my head
is not something that gets better.

25:10.552 --> 25:12.679
This is it.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.224
Call Papania.

25:57.641 --> 25:59.726
Shit. I can't get a signal.

26:01.436 --> 26:03.230
I'm gonna ask to use the phone.

26:06.274 --> 26:07.692
You know what, I'll go ask.

26:10.320 --> 26:11.488
Marty.

26:13.949 --> 26:15.617
This is the place.

26:44.813 --> 26:45.981
Hello.

26:47.899 --> 26:49.484
Damn it!

26:51.111 --> 26:54.447
Pardon me, ma'am,
we're professional surveyors,

26:54.531 --> 26:57.826
and got lost on these back roads
like a couple of greenhorns.

26:59.286 --> 27:01.454
Cell phone is getting no service out here.

27:01.538 --> 27:04.499
Is there any way that I could
use your phone?

27:05.792 --> 27:08.128
We don't have no phone, mister.

27:08.211 --> 27:09.587
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.631
No, I said!

27:11.715 --> 27:14.134
Stop it over there, or I'll kick you.

27:14.217 --> 27:16.219
Could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

27:20.348 --> 27:22.976
The water around here
is not really good.

27:23.059 --> 27:25.895
Sit, I said! Stop it! I'm gonna kick you!

27:25.979 --> 27:27.939
Where's Billy Childress?

27:28.732 --> 27:30.525
- Old Bill?
- Yeah.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.861
He's in his house, mister.

27:34.654 --> 27:36.197
This isn't his?

27:37.365 --> 27:41.369
Where... Who do you live here with?

27:42.120 --> 27:44.164
I think you should go now.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.209
Where is he?

27:49.502 --> 27:51.004
All around us.

27:52.213 --> 27:53.882
Before you were born,

27:55.050 --> 27:56.760
and after you die.

27:58.219 --> 28:02.265
No! No! Get out of my house, mister!

28:12.108 --> 28:13.902
Marty, clear the house.

28:47.352 --> 28:49.979
Don't move! On your knees, now!

28:51.481 --> 28:53.358
On your knees, now!

28:54.025 --> 28:55.068
No.

30:29.037 --> 30:30.914
Everybody has a phone.

30:31.206 --> 30:32.665
Where's yours?

30:34.375 --> 30:36.336
He's gonna come for you.

30:37.545 --> 30:39.506
He's worse than anybody.

30:41.257 --> 30:42.300
No!

30:42.383 --> 30:44.511
Where's your fucking phone?

30:53.686 --> 30:55.313
Come with me, little man.

30:56.606 --> 30:58.942
Come in here with me.

31:44.612 --> 31:45.697
Rust?

31:47.073 --> 31:48.157
Yeah?

31:48.741 --> 31:50.159
- Rust!
- Here!

32:18.730 --> 32:21.357
Come on inside, little priest.

33:34.013 --> 33:36.140
To your right, little priest.

33:38.893 --> 33:41.270
Take the bride's path.

33:46.859 --> 33:48.611
This is Carcosa.

33:53.241 --> 33:55.451
You know what they did to me?

33:58.996 --> 34:03.000
What I will do
to all the sons and daughters of man.

34:04.419 --> 34:06.212
You blessed, Reggie,

34:07.463 --> 34:08.756
Dewall,

34:10.967 --> 34:12.260
acolytes,

34:14.220 --> 34:16.389
witnesses to my journey.

34:22.729 --> 34:23.938
Lovers.

34:25.356 --> 34:27.316
I'm not ashamed.

34:31.571 --> 34:34.490
Come die with me, little priest.

35:12.153 --> 35:13.237
Rust?

35:24.165 --> 35:25.249
Rust?

37:06.058 --> 37:08.644
Now, take off your mask!

38:39.318 --> 38:40.403
Rust?

39:04.468 --> 39:05.594
Fuck!

39:06.637 --> 39:08.889
He cut me pretty good, Marty.

39:09.598 --> 39:10.975
No, Rust.

39:12.852 --> 39:14.311
It ain't bad.

39:15.771 --> 39:17.273
It ain't bad.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.963
Give me a forward team in the house.

39:41.047 --> 39:43.174
Give me a second team on that back house.

39:43.257 --> 39:45.801
Deputy, light up these woods.

40:01.150 --> 40:02.276
Here!

40:04.528 --> 40:06.447
Here! We're here!

40:09.200 --> 40:10.326
Hey!

40:19.293 --> 40:21.629
That's the last thing I remember.

40:21.962 --> 40:23.756
I was on the ground,

40:24.381 --> 40:25.674
sirens.

40:27.760 --> 40:29.720
Saying my friend's name.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.392
The girl is a nut.

40:35.893 --> 40:37.269
She talked some but...

40:37.353 --> 40:40.523
It was a group of guys, pedophiles and so'f.

40:40.606 --> 40:42.608
Voodoo worship.

40:42.691 --> 40:45.194
The man Cohle shot dead
was the old man's son.

40:45.277 --> 40:46.779
No records.

40:46.862 --> 40:49.031
The girl was at least a half-sister.

40:49.115 --> 40:50.616
- DNA comparison...
- Stop.

40:50.699 --> 40:54.286
Really, man, stop. I don't wanna hear it.

40:55.204 --> 40:58.165
Well, we're still
cataloging everything.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.502
But knife cast came back from that shed.

41:01.794 --> 41:04.004
One of them matched our Lake Charles case.

41:04.088 --> 41:06.549
Another matched Dora Lange's wounds.

41:06.632 --> 41:08.175
Had his prints.

41:09.885 --> 41:12.388
Look, man, we owe you on this collar.

41:13.097 --> 41:14.473
How's Rust?

41:19.728 --> 41:21.230
He hasn't woke up.

41:21.689 --> 41:23.899
Been in a coma since surgery.

41:26.944 --> 41:29.488
They came by when you first got here.

41:34.743 --> 41:37.079
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

41:41.917 --> 41:44.086
It's so good to see you all.

41:45.713 --> 41:47.089
I didn't expect you.

41:57.057 --> 41:58.350
How are you?

42:01.937 --> 42:03.230
Good.

42:04.648 --> 42:06.358
I'm fine.

42:10.946 --> 42:13.782
Yeah, I'll be fine. I mean...

42:15.784 --> 42:16.869
I am

42:18.495 --> 42:19.663
fine.

42:37.014 --> 42:38.599
<i>And now, the latest news update</i>

42:38.682 --> 42:40.893
<i>in the case of alleged
Louisiana serial murderer</i>

42:40.976 --> 42:42.811
<i>Errol William Childress.</i>

42:42.895 --> 42:45.439
<i>It's a story that first broke nationwide
two weeks ago,</i>

42:45.522 --> 42:48.525
<i>when two former police officers,
now private detectives,</i>

42:48.609 --> 42:52.571

<i>Our last update confirmed

42:56.575 --> 42:59.203
<i>proved connections

43:00.204 --> 43:02.915
<i>In the meantime,
the state attorney general and the FBI</i>

43:02.998 --> 43:04.041
<i>have discredited rumors</i>

43:04.124 --> 43:06.126
<i>that the accused was in some way related</i>

43:06.210 --> 43:09.213
<i>to the family of
Louisiana Senator Edwin Tuttle.</i>

44:00.973 --> 44:02.933
What are you doing here?

44:03.559 --> 44:06.061
Nothing. Nurse said I could come in.

44:07.396 --> 44:08.772
Are you watching me sleep?

44:08.856 --> 44:11.442
You know what, I just got here,
I was gonna leave,

44:11.525 --> 44:12.651
but then you woke up.

44:12.735 --> 44:14.486
Jesus, what's your fucking problem?

44:14.570 --> 44:15.988
Nothing. What's your problem?

44:16.071 --> 44:18.907
Not a care in the world.

44:20.617 --> 44:22.244
I saw him, Marty.

44:24.705 --> 44:28.250
He was mowing that school yard
in Pelican Island, in '95.

44:30.711 --> 44:32.296
I couldn't tell how tall he was.

44:33.756 --> 44:37.593
'Cause he was sitting
and his face was dirty, but...

44:38.927 --> 44:40.512
I saw him.

44:43.599 --> 44:45.642
That's what's bugging you?

44:46.643 --> 44:49.104
Tuttles... The men in the video...

44:52.941 --> 44:54.943
We didn't get them all.

44:55.027 --> 44:58.155
And we ain't gonna get them all,
that ain't what kind of world it is,

44:58.238 --> 44:59.615
but we got ours.

45:03.327 --> 45:05.454
I'm not supposed to be here.

45:08.415 --> 45:09.875
Yeah, well,

45:11.293 --> 45:13.712
I'll come back by tomorrow, buddy.

45:13.962 --> 45:15.297
Why?

45:16.090 --> 45:17.966
Don't ever change, man.

46:49.558 --> 46:53.145
Doc said you'll probably get out in a few days.

46:53.228 --> 46:56.482
I'll make sure you get a ride, a place to stay.

46:56.565 --> 46:58.567
Yeah, I'll figure it out.

46:59.067 --> 47:01.195
Well, it's already been figured out.

47:01.278 --> 47:02.362
Hey.

47:03.739 --> 47:05.741
I brought you something.

47:10.245 --> 47:11.830
Are we getting engaged?

47:12.372 --> 47:15.918
If we were getting engaged,
I'd have got a nicer ribbon.

47:21.673 --> 47:23.926
- You remembered?
- Yeah.

47:24.801 --> 47:27.262
Let's get out from under this roof, huh?

47:27.346 --> 47:28.680
Good idea.

47:31.016 --> 47:33.018
Yeah, I can push
two goddamn wheels on my own.

47:33.101 --> 47:37.064
Yeah, I ought to let you
rip out your fucking stitches. Stop it.

47:39.608 --> 47:42.528
Feeling better? You're ahead of me.

47:45.864 --> 47:48.617
I shouldn't even fucking be here, Marty.

47:49.535 --> 47:52.454
I believe, "No shit" is the proper response

47:52.538 --> 47:54.039
to that observation.

47:54.957 --> 47:57.042
No, I don't mean like that.

47:57.459 --> 47:59.253
It's something else.

48:00.254 --> 48:02.005
What is so...

48:02.089 --> 48:03.632
Talk to me, Rust.

48:12.015 --> 48:13.767
There was a moment...

48:14.309 --> 48:17.646
I know when I was under
in the dark that something...

48:19.147 --> 48:21.233
Whatever I had been reduced to,

48:21.316 --> 48:23.277
not even consciousness,

48:23.360 --> 48:26.655
it was a vague awareness in the dark...

48:27.447 --> 48:28.699
And I could...

48:31.201 --> 48:34.288
I could feel my definitions fading.

48:36.164 --> 48:38.584
And beneath that darkness,

48:38.667 --> 48:41.628
there was another kind, it was deeper,

48:42.754 --> 48:43.839
warm.

48:44.423 --> 48:46.174
Like a substance.

48:48.844 --> 48:50.512
I could feel, man.

48:51.388 --> 48:52.889
And I knew...

48:53.098 --> 48:57.477
I knew my daughter waited for me there.

48:58.520 --> 48:59.646
So clear...

49:00.355 --> 49:02.024
I could feel her.

49:04.359 --> 49:06.028
I could feel them.

49:07.154 --> 49:10.574
I could feel a piece of my pop, too.

49:13.201 --> 49:17.539
It was like I was a part
of everything that I ever loved.

49:17.623 --> 49:19.249
And we were all,

49:20.709 --> 49:23.211
the three of us, just fading out.

49:27.424 --> 49:30.177
And all I had to do was let go.

49:32.429 --> 49:33.764
And I did.

49:35.891 --> 49:38.018
I said, "Darkness, yeah!"

49:40.896 --> 49:42.564
And I disappeared.

49:45.025 --> 49:47.569
But I could still feel

49:49.237 --> 49:50.781
her love there.

49:52.574 --> 49:54.451
Even more than before.

49:56.495 --> 49:57.829
Nothing...

50:02.709 --> 50:04.586
Nothing but that love.

50:17.766 --> 50:19.518
And then I woke up.

50:25.440 --> 50:26.608
Hey...

50:32.698 --> 50:33.699
Didn't...

50:35.283 --> 50:37.911
Didn't you tell me one time, at dinner,

50:38.912 --> 50:41.456
once, maybe, about... You used to...

50:43.792 --> 50:46.253
You used to make up stories about the stars?

50:48.797 --> 50:51.007
Yeah, I was

50:52.968 --> 50:54.344
in Alaska

50:55.303 --> 50:57.139
under the night skies.

50:57.556 --> 51:00.308
Yeah. You used to lay there and look up.

51:01.143 --> 51:02.978
Yeah. At the stars.

51:05.147 --> 51:09.985
You remember,
I never watched a TV till I was 17,

51:10.068 --> 51:11.903
so there wasn't much to fucking do out there,

51:11.987 --> 51:14.114
besides walk around, explore.

51:14.990 --> 51:15.991
And...

51:16.783 --> 51:20.203
And then look up at the stars
and make up stories.

51:21.121 --> 51:22.456
Like what?

51:24.332 --> 51:28.003
I'll tell you, Marty,
I've been up in that room,

51:28.086 --> 51:30.464
looking out those windows every night here.

51:30.547 --> 51:32.174
Just thinking

51:38.388 --> 51:40.182
it's just one story.

51:41.516 --> 51:42.893
The oldest.

51:46.855 --> 51:48.231
What's that?

51:50.817 --> 51:52.486
Light versus dark.

51:56.531 --> 51:57.657
Well,

51:58.700 --> 52:00.911
I know we ain't in Alaska

52:02.621 --> 52:06.541
but it appears to me
that the dark has a lot more territory.

52:10.962 --> 52:12.047
Yeah.

52:13.548 --> 52:15.509
You're right about that.

52:21.181 --> 52:23.183
- Hey, listen. Hey.
- Yeah, what?

52:23.892 --> 52:26.561
Could you point me
in the direction of that car?

52:26.645 --> 52:30.440
Man, I spent enough of my fucking life
in a hospital.

52:31.483 --> 52:33.318
Jesus.

52:33.401 --> 52:36.112
You know what? I'd protest

52:36.947 --> 52:39.908
but it occurs to me that you're un-killable.

52:40.492 --> 52:42.994
You wanna go back,
get your clothes or anything?

52:43.078 --> 52:46.039
No. Anything I left back there, I don't need.

52:51.920 --> 52:54.005
You're looking at it wrong,

52:54.548 --> 52:56.424
at the sky.

52:57.384 --> 52:58.760
How's that?

53:00.512 --> 53:02.389
Once there was only dark.

53:05.100 --> 53:07.894
If you ask me, the light's winning.
