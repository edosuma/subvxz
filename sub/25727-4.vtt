WEBVTT

00:00.195 --> 00:02.536
Dear spirits, if you're listening,

00:02.547 --> 00:04.715
my name is Esther,
and before we get started,

00:04.716 --> 00:08.678
"I do want to let you know, I
am 5'1" and a size extra-small,

00:08.679 --> 00:10.304
in case you left behind any cute clothes

00:10.305 --> 00:12.098
you want to point me
in the direction of.

00:12.099 --> 00:15.142
Oh, also, apologies,
dear souls, for I have lost

00:15.143 --> 00:18.854
the official Ouija widget,
but I have here the shoe

00:18.855 --> 00:22.483
from your sister game, Monopoly, which
was made in the same manufacturer,

00:22.484 --> 00:25.945
so, fingers crossed, we're good.

00:25.946 --> 00:27.988
Esther...

00:27.989 --> 00:31.409
Esther, get your unwashed hair
away from those candles

00:31.410 --> 00:32.910
before you start a grease fire!

00:32.911 --> 00:35.079
Benjamin, we talked about this.

00:35.080 --> 00:38.582
Spirits don't sound like that.
It's up here!

00:38.583 --> 00:39.917
They're higher!

00:39.918 --> 00:42.670
I've got a showing in 15 minutes.
You gotta wrap up this sÃ©ance.

00:42.671 --> 00:44.338
I can't. Oh, please don't.

00:44.339 --> 00:47.341
Please. I'm so close
to pinning down Elma.

00:47.342 --> 00:49.927
I have no idea what time zone
the afterlife is in,

00:49.928 --> 00:51.887
but it is not Pacific Standard.

00:51.888 --> 00:53.639
Well, when you make contact,

00:53.640 --> 00:55.141
be sure to thank her for getting
brutally murdered here

00:55.142 --> 00:57.498
and making this house
completely unsellable.

00:57.509 --> 00:59.009
Well, I won't lead with that.

00:59.010 --> 01:01.970
Also, let her know that ghosts
aren't real, so she doesn't exist.

01:01.971 --> 01:04.348
Ooh. Benji, don't say the "g" -word, OK?

01:04.349 --> 01:06.350
The P. C. Term is "phantasma."

01:06.351 --> 01:09.353
Is there a ghost here?
Ghosts! Ghosts, are you here?

01:09.354 --> 01:10.813
Ghosts, throw something at me!

01:10.814 --> 01:12.731
It's not me, it's him. I'm good.

01:12.732 --> 01:14.666
She just wants free clothes out of you.

01:14.677 --> 01:17.648
Just if they're there. I don't want
them to go to waste. Nobody does.

01:18.511 --> 01:21.526
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:22.701 --> 01:24.618
Right this way.

01:24.619 --> 01:27.329
Obviously, this is the very
retro-chic kitchen.

01:27.330 --> 01:29.832
Ooh, I love this stove!

01:29.833 --> 01:32.626
The color is called "aqua."
It has lead in the paint,

01:32.627 --> 01:33.877
and that's why it really pops.

01:33.878 --> 01:35.379
Well, we just love this place,

01:35.380 --> 01:37.047
so what are the next steps?

01:37.048 --> 01:38.998
Oh, yeah, great, well,
we just open up escrow,

01:39.009 --> 01:41.427
get some inspectors in here,
I fulfill my legal obligation

01:41.428 --> 01:42.970
to you guys to let you know

01:42.971 --> 01:44.689
that an unsolved homicide occurred here,

01:44.700 --> 01:46.908
and then, um, we just sign some papers,

01:46.926 --> 01:48.990
and before you know it,
you guys are making marinara

01:49.001 --> 01:50.085
in the home of your dreams.

01:51.438 --> 01:53.897
Please buy this house. Please.

01:53.898 --> 01:55.649
I mean, if you think
of all human history,

01:55.650 --> 01:57.693
someone's been murdered
pretty much everywhere.

01:57.694 --> 02:00.112
But you guys have to have a house

02:00.113 --> 02:01.794
where no one's been murdered.

02:01.805 --> 02:03.449
You know what, try a house on the Moon.

02:03.450 --> 02:05.576
Elon Musk yourself up there.

02:08.746 --> 02:10.455
I'm gonna be stuck here forever.

02:10.457 --> 02:12.740
Dean's gonna have me here
from ten to six every day,

02:12.751 --> 02:14.825
nine to seven on weekends,
for the rest of my life.

02:14.836 --> 02:17.153
Does this mean you're cool
if I eat the courtesy cookies?

02:17.164 --> 02:19.288
You're not even sympathizing.
You just want cookies.

02:19.299 --> 02:21.633
That's real estate. You give
away free cookies and waters.

02:21.634 --> 02:23.882
That's, like, the whole job.
You're doing the job!

02:23.893 --> 02:26.303
I... I think I'm just gonna curl
up in a ball and take a nap.

02:26.314 --> 02:28.808
I read this thing that said that's
the best thing to do in prison.

02:28.819 --> 02:30.434
Oh. I read the best thing
to do in prison

02:30.435 --> 02:32.770
is make a shiv out of a popsicle stick.

02:32.771 --> 02:34.521
I feel like you didn't click on the link

02:34.522 --> 02:36.315
and you just read the headline.

02:36.316 --> 02:40.110
And this here is known
as a "kitchen island."

02:40.111 --> 02:41.259
I didn't know what they were

02:41.270 --> 02:43.670
until I went to a rich kid's
house, but there you have one.

02:43.681 --> 02:46.992
Oh, my God. I love the floors.
They are so kitschy.

02:46.993 --> 02:49.620
I like to say this house
has "resting kitsch face."

02:49.621 --> 02:51.330
Hello.

02:51.331 --> 02:53.540
Oh, and this is my associate, Benji.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.918
Uh, I was just showing Pilar
and her husband here

02:55.919 --> 02:57.711
the intricacies of this house.

02:57.712 --> 03:00.088
I love the imperfections
on these countertops.

03:00.089 --> 03:01.870
Oh, yeah, they add character.

03:01.881 --> 03:04.384
And if you look closely, you can
see where a dead woman's tooth

03:04.385 --> 03:07.053
maybe scraped against it. It's just
a theory I have, and there's...

03:07.064 --> 03:10.431
Do you mind if I borrow her for a sec
for a little, quick realtor chat?

03:10.442 --> 03:11.975
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

03:11.976 --> 03:13.236
Esther, right this way.

03:13.247 --> 03:16.563
What are you doing?
Stop. Bringing. Up. The murder.

03:16.564 --> 03:19.233
Benji, do you know a thing about sales?

03:19.234 --> 03:21.568
Exploit your flaws,
find what makes you you,

03:21.569 --> 03:23.237
and lean into it!

03:23.238 --> 03:27.075
For this house, it's phffft... murder!

03:28.409 --> 03:30.327
Guess they... they're into it,
sort of, right?

03:30.328 --> 03:31.787
- Yeah.
- Esther,

03:31.788 --> 03:35.040
do you know where the body
was actually found?

03:35.041 --> 03:36.917
Yes, I do. Great question.

03:36.918 --> 03:40.546
So her hands were
covered in blood. And she...

03:40.547 --> 03:43.799
dragged them all the way
down the hallway

03:43.800 --> 03:46.552
into this very living room, and then...

03:46.553 --> 03:49.012
blood print, blood print, blood print!

03:49.013 --> 03:52.432
Aah! She fell right here, and she died.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.643
Why is why we just got
brand new Berber carpeting

03:54.644 --> 03:56.478
with Scotchgard stain repellent.

03:56.479 --> 03:58.564
I could have my period
right now. No one would know.

03:58.565 --> 03:59.566
Nothing would absorb.

04:01.526 --> 04:03.860
This place is amazing.

04:05.321 --> 04:07.739
So, uh, how do you guys
want to go about making an offer?

04:07.750 --> 04:09.403
Are you working with an agent, or...?

04:09.414 --> 04:12.995
No. Oh, God, no.
We do not want to live here.

04:12.996 --> 04:14.324
Can we take some more selfies

04:14.335 --> 04:15.973
where the body was actually found?

04:15.984 --> 04:18.375
Just 'cause my followers
are gonna be obsessed with it.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.961
I knew you guys were too hipster-y
to be able to afford a home.

04:21.589 --> 04:24.342
Do you wanna add me on Insta?

04:24.353 --> 04:25.895
- Um...
- That's a "no."

04:25.906 --> 04:27.426
You see how long that "um" took?

04:27.427 --> 04:29.387
Dean's gonna kill me.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.474
Benji. Did you know that Elma's
stuff is still in the attic?

04:34.475 --> 04:37.998
I mean, this thing is heavy and
could 100% be a murder weapon.

04:38.009 --> 04:40.443
Esther, a team of detectives
went through this place

04:40.454 --> 04:42.045
with gloves and forensic brooms.

04:42.056 --> 04:44.420
Do you really think the girl
with sticky jelly hands

04:44.431 --> 04:45.577
is gonna crack the case?

04:45.588 --> 04:48.006
Don't underestimate
a fresh perspective, OK?

04:48.017 --> 04:50.352
Flamin' Hot Cheetos
were invented by a janitor.

04:50.363 --> 04:51.467
Sounds like urban myth.

04:51.478 --> 04:53.857
Is this the house
where the lady got murdered?

04:53.868 --> 04:55.006
Yeah. What do you want?

04:55.017 --> 04:57.863
We saw it on Instagram.
How much is the tour?

04:57.874 --> 04:59.889
Um, $30 a... a person.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.651
But we have a group discount, how many?

05:01.662 --> 05:03.545
Um, there's six of us.

05:03.546 --> 05:06.201
Perfect. Hopefully, there won't be five

05:06.212 --> 05:09.882
by the time we're done. Phffft!

05:13.556 --> 05:17.392
Eighty, 100, 120, 140...

05:17.393 --> 05:20.520
We made $160 on accident!

05:20.521 --> 05:22.200
- Off one show!
- Imagine if we tried.

05:22.211 --> 05:23.982
That's really impressive. If we just did

05:23.983 --> 05:25.638
a couple shows a day, six times a week,

05:25.649 --> 05:27.694
we'll have enough money
to pay rent on that place.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.696
And then you won't have to sell it.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.198
And I will have the job I never knew

05:31.199 --> 05:34.493
I always dreamed of.
Forensic performance artist.

05:34.494 --> 05:36.620
- Well, we need a marketing plan.
- OK.

05:36.621 --> 05:39.581
Um, my MySpace pull has kind
of dwindled, as you know.

05:39.582 --> 05:41.291
- I would think.
- But I can make fliers!

05:41.292 --> 05:44.086
Great. You handle marketing.
I'll handle casting, costumes,

05:44.087 --> 05:47.381
lighting design, set design. I mean,
I know we don't wanna overdo it,

05:47.382 --> 05:49.299
but we also don't want to underdo it.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.019
I don't think we've ever been this
excited about something together.

05:52.994 --> 05:55.055
Except for "Babe, Pig in the City."

05:55.056 --> 05:56.682
- What a movie.
- I know.

05:56.683 --> 05:59.851
Look, dude, literally everyone
that gets on this bus

05:59.852 --> 06:02.771
has an idea for a death
I should put on my tour.

06:02.772 --> 06:05.482
I just got pitched a spooky dog
that OD'd on grapes.

06:05.483 --> 06:08.777
I get that. And that's why I'm goin' to
you and not Tinseltown Murder Mobile.

06:08.778 --> 06:11.571
Oh, that hack! He's still
goin' to the Viper Room.

06:11.572 --> 06:15.158
River Phoenix died in '93.
That stone has been bled dry.

06:15.159 --> 06:17.703
Dude, this house is so scary.
Every time I turn a corner,

06:17.704 --> 06:19.746
I'm expecting Jack Nicholson
with an axe.

06:19.747 --> 06:23.376
The woman who used to live there
got bludgeoned to death.

06:24.127 --> 06:25.836
- Is there parking?
- So much parking.

06:25.847 --> 06:27.661
Is there a ramp?
Law says I gotta have a ramp.

06:27.672 --> 06:30.716
15 bucks and a trip to a hardware
store, I'll build a ramp so smooth,

06:30.717 --> 06:32.217
colostomy bags won't even jiggle.

06:32.218 --> 06:33.969
Tell me about the lady.
Is she a soap star,

06:33.970 --> 06:36.596
porn star, child star? All three?

06:36.597 --> 06:40.392
She's way cooler than that.
She's a part-time librarian...

06:40.393 --> 06:41.935
She's not even famous? Look...

06:41.936 --> 06:45.814
This is a "Hollywood Death Tour," OK?

06:45.815 --> 06:47.774
If I wanted to see a regular person die,

06:47.775 --> 06:50.611
I would just ride the Metrolink.
Thank you!

06:52.862 --> 06:54.807
<i>All right, let's do this!</i>

06:54.818 --> 06:57.409
Hey, are you guys interested
in a pop-up murder experience?

06:57.410 --> 06:59.068
Hey! Get away from my customers!

06:59.079 --> 07:00.544
Murder house tour, tonight at 8:00!

07:00.555 --> 07:02.706
There's no seat belts
in that death van, I checked!

07:02.707 --> 07:04.076
Get out!

07:08.052 --> 07:09.745
- Hey, Esther.
- Hey, Jeff.

07:09.756 --> 07:11.590
Listen, I was thinking that my entrance

07:11.591 --> 07:12.685
would have a bigger impact

07:12.696 --> 07:14.593
if I jumped out of the closet
and scared people.

07:14.594 --> 07:16.845
OK, that's very haunted house vibes,

07:16.846 --> 07:19.222
and we're trying to recreate history.

07:19.223 --> 07:21.266
This is supposed to be authentic?

07:21.267 --> 07:24.479
You got me dressed up as some old
white lady's trashy older brother.

07:24.490 --> 07:27.355
- I look like I drive a fan boat to work.
- Wha... Is that bad?

07:27.356 --> 07:29.649
Esther, I just don't think
Elma would wear this to bed.

07:29.650 --> 07:31.026
I mean, she had a lover.

07:31.027 --> 07:32.694
Tara, you just have to understand

07:32.695 --> 07:35.322
that nightgowns are very sexy
to Elma's generation.

07:35.323 --> 07:36.698
You've got bare ankles showing.

07:36.699 --> 07:38.867
Bare ankles are the side boob
of the '50s.

07:38.868 --> 07:42.621
Also, if Jeff's gonna jump out
of a closet, can I wear these?

07:44.081 --> 07:45.665
No. I love the effort,

07:45.666 --> 07:47.751
but it's just not what we're going for.

07:47.752 --> 07:52.297
Hi, folks! Uh, I'm Mark.
I'm playing Elma's lover, Ron.

07:52.298 --> 07:53.299
He's my lover?

07:54.634 --> 07:56.635
- Maybe she would wear this.
- See?

07:56.636 --> 07:58.303
So excited about this opportunity.

07:58.304 --> 08:00.722
Um, listen, I don't want
to cause any trouble,

08:00.723 --> 08:02.527
but could I...
could I get my wife a comp?

08:02.538 --> 08:04.217
There's no comps!
And if that's a problem,

08:04.228 --> 08:06.185
I will send you right back
to where I found you

08:06.196 --> 08:07.813
in Craigslist casting. Understood?

08:07.814 --> 08:09.731
- Understood. Not a problem.
- Great.

08:09.732 --> 08:12.776
Guys, I'm sorry
if I'm a little worked up,

08:12.777 --> 08:17.155
but a woman died here. And we owe
it to her memory to get this right.

08:17.156 --> 08:20.075
I didn't spend 15 hours
at the Burbank public library

08:20.076 --> 08:21.910
going through microfiche for nothing.

08:21.911 --> 08:23.495
Isn't all that stuff digitized?

08:23.496 --> 08:25.288
Yes, they informed me of that
at hour 16.

08:25.289 --> 08:28.167
Oof. What library is open for 16 hours?

08:29.544 --> 08:31.461
I thought your
"jump out" idea was strong.

08:31.462 --> 08:34.506
Well, I thought that your
vampire teeth were very sexy.

08:34.506 --> 08:36.131
If I may.

08:36.133 --> 08:38.092
You may.

08:38.094 --> 08:41.804
You may all day.

08:41.806 --> 08:43.601
Ooh.

08:43.611 --> 08:44.725
So, where you guys from?

08:46.894 --> 08:49.688
Benji, this is a packed house.

08:49.689 --> 08:51.064
How did you find all these people?

08:51.065 --> 08:53.127
I just fliered where
creepy people hang out.

08:53.138 --> 08:54.877
You know, I started
at the Spencer Gifts,

08:54.888 --> 08:57.533
but you know where the creepiest
people were? The seafood buffet!

08:57.544 --> 09:00.354
I mean, I wouldn't feel safe
alone with any of them.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.573
They're perfect!

09:01.584 --> 09:04.236
Hey, Esther, uh, there's something
you need to see by the pantry.

09:04.247 --> 09:06.037
Oh, is it the blood spatter?

09:06.038 --> 09:08.947
Right this way, Esther!

09:08.958 --> 09:12.794
Ah! Ah! What the hell?

09:13.045 --> 09:14.421
Wha...?

09:14.422 --> 09:15.839
Jeff, are you OK?

09:15.840 --> 09:19.134
Yeah, I was gonna do, like,
a scary, "jump out" thing,

09:19.135 --> 09:21.720
but this door wouldn't open.

09:21.721 --> 09:23.805
I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding.
You're welcome.

09:23.806 --> 09:25.725
- What happened?
- Somethin' fell on me.

09:26.851 --> 09:28.143
What is this?

09:28.144 --> 09:30.353
Whoa! This could've killed you!

09:30.354 --> 09:32.981
That's a big jar o' honey!
Oh, it's got a honeycomb in it.

09:32.982 --> 09:36.151
That means it's fancy. I read
a pamphlet about this stuff.

09:36.152 --> 09:39.154
I'm paraphrasing, but it's made
from super slutty bees.

09:39.155 --> 09:40.822
What does that mean?

09:40.823 --> 09:43.909
Jeffrey, this is what happens
when you disrespect Elma.

09:43.910 --> 09:46.953
Elma, girl, I'm sorry,
and it won't happen again.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.538
All right, a ghost threw honey at me,

09:48.539 --> 09:50.999
and now I'm bleeding, so... I'm out.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.793
Jeff, I'm sorry. Did you sign a waiver?

09:53.794 --> 09:55.629
You know I didn't.

09:55.630 --> 09:57.650
So, Benji...

09:57.661 --> 09:59.603
Congratulations.
You're our new Elma's brother.

09:59.614 --> 10:01.698
Trick handshake!

10:01.844 --> 10:06.056
And now, the culmination
of that horrible night,

10:06.057 --> 10:10.393
where Elma took her... ... final breath.

10:10.394 --> 10:13.063
Before you decide who the killer was,

10:13.064 --> 10:15.982
we will hear from each of the suspects,

10:15.983 --> 10:19.444
starting with me, Lauren Van Vleet,

10:19.445 --> 10:24.449
Elma's mysterious - yet,
mysteriously beautiful - neighbor.

10:24.450 --> 10:29.996
I was a movie star
until pictures started talking!

10:29.997 --> 10:33.708
Then, the roles dried up,
and I had nothing to do all day

10:33.709 --> 10:37.587
but sit at home and listen
to that damn Elma's dog

10:37.588 --> 10:40.966
barking, yip-yip-yap all day.

10:40.967 --> 10:44.845
Was it enough to drive me to murder?

10:46.389 --> 10:49.933
Did I kill Elma
with this bronze schnauzer

10:49.934 --> 10:51.977
pseudo-antique from Pottery Barn?

10:51.978 --> 10:55.772
I thought you came for a cup of sugar!

10:55.773 --> 10:59.109
Not a cup of... murder!

11:00.111 --> 11:02.238
Ha ha ha ha ha!

11:04.323 --> 11:07.867
Or was it me, Mark?

11:07.868 --> 11:11.955
I mean, Ron. Elma's lover.
Slash accountant.

11:11.956 --> 11:15.667
A little bit of wine,
a little bit of sex.

11:15.668 --> 11:19.004
A little bit of... murder?!

11:19.005 --> 11:22.882
Ron, you were always a lover of numbers,

11:22.883 --> 11:25.510
but this just doesn't add up!

11:25.511 --> 11:26.512
Aah!

11:28.639 --> 11:31.016
I didn't go
no money when our daddy died.

11:31.017 --> 11:33.727
She got it all! She didn't care none

11:33.728 --> 11:35.812
that I was eatin' cans o' tuna

11:35.813 --> 11:37.797
while she was up here in this castle.

11:37.808 --> 11:39.436
Why are you doing that accent?

11:39.447 --> 11:41.609
- Making a choice!
- Maybe I killed her

11:41.610 --> 11:43.820
with this here fancy ashtray!

11:43.821 --> 11:46.990
But you gave me that for my birthday!

11:46.991 --> 11:49.743
Not my death day!

11:49.744 --> 11:50.994
- Aah!
- Yeehoo!

11:55.791 --> 11:59.836
My blood is on
someone's hands. But whose?

11:59.837 --> 12:02.840
My soul can't rest! Aah...

12:07.345 --> 12:08.428
What?

12:11.140 --> 12:14.935
Thank you. Thank you so much.

12:17.355 --> 12:20.065
I can't help but think
Elma would've loved that show.

12:20.066 --> 12:21.589
Oh, yeah. Except for the part

12:21.600 --> 12:23.151
where she got bludgeoned to death.

12:23.162 --> 12:25.390
I can't believe we pulled it off.
Pretty soon, instead of

12:25.401 --> 12:27.072
sitting around here all day
doing nothin',

12:27.073 --> 12:29.919
I'm gonna be home, sitting
around all day doing nothin'.

12:29.930 --> 12:31.951
But you'll still
come play the part, right?

12:31.952 --> 12:33.286
I'm good. I don't need it.

12:33.287 --> 12:35.121
You got a standing ovation.

12:35.122 --> 12:37.665
Well, there weren't that many,
like, seats available, so...

12:37.666 --> 12:39.170
Tara, can you excuse us?

12:39.181 --> 12:41.461
I don't want you to give him
a false sense of confidence.

12:41.462 --> 12:42.754
We'll do notes in five.

12:42.755 --> 12:44.048
OK.

12:46.425 --> 12:48.468
She's taking the pizza?

12:48.469 --> 12:51.888
You were so good in this role
that I think Elma may have died

12:51.889 --> 12:54.057
just so you could
play her brother in my show.

12:54.058 --> 12:56.935
Thank you, yeah. I got really
wrapped up in the character, and...

12:56.936 --> 12:59.312
Hi. You guys both did a
great job of bringing home

12:59.313 --> 13:01.481
that somebody died
right here in this house.

13:01.482 --> 13:04.692
It's a terrible thing.
I'd like to buy it.

13:04.693 --> 13:08.655
It is not for sale.
I'm so sorry. Right, Benji?

13:08.656 --> 13:10.990
Esther, everything's for sale.
Especially this house!

13:10.991 --> 13:13.910
- Sold, sir!
- What? No!

13:13.911 --> 13:15.704
Are you working with an agent?

13:17.832 --> 13:21.042
Benjamin Leonard.
You cannot sell this house.

13:21.043 --> 13:22.836
Did you just call me "Benjamin Leonard"?

13:22.837 --> 13:24.170
Isn't that your middle name?

13:24.171 --> 13:26.381
No, you're just assuming
my name is "Leonard"?

13:26.382 --> 13:28.967
- I mean, look at you.
- OK, "Esther Leonard."

13:28.968 --> 13:30.802
Don't give up on yourself.

13:30.803 --> 13:34.222
Imagine if the surfer girl had quit
after the shark bit her arm off.

13:34.223 --> 13:36.182
Who would have spoken
at my high school assembly?

13:36.183 --> 13:38.226
Who would have inspired me
to achieve such greatness

13:38.227 --> 13:39.811
as a murder house tour?

13:39.812 --> 13:41.813
Bet on yourself, Benjamin.

13:41.814 --> 13:43.773
I'm not betting on myself, OK?

13:43.774 --> 13:45.024
I'm not the horse you bet on.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.734
I'm the horse you make glue out of.

13:46.735 --> 13:49.028
Then bet on me, 'cause I'm smart.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.156
And this is my best idea
since I started wearing

13:51.157 --> 13:53.783
Cinemark polo shirts
to get into movies for free.

13:53.784 --> 13:55.577
And that's free popcorn, too.

13:55.578 --> 13:57.996
That was the greatest
Goodwill find ever, but...

13:57.997 --> 13:59.164
Thank you.

13:59.165 --> 14:01.624
I'm sorry. I work for my brother.

14:01.625 --> 14:04.503
This is his house. It's gotta go.

14:06.336 --> 14:08.506
So, James, the pipes are in great shape.

14:08.507 --> 14:12.238
The wiring is all up to code.
We're gonna get that railing fixed.

14:12.249 --> 14:14.804
Oh, and of course, we're gonna
get this fake blood cleaned up.

14:14.805 --> 14:18.683
No need to touch anything.
I like it just as it is.

14:18.684 --> 14:21.103
I wonder how long it would take
to crawl across this room.

14:26.609 --> 14:29.528
You're a fun guy, James. Very spry.

14:32.156 --> 14:34.657
Well, Benji, we created
something amazing,

14:34.658 --> 14:36.659
and now it's gone forever.

14:36.660 --> 14:38.119
I guess I can reuse the fake blood

14:38.120 --> 14:40.246
to decorate Christmas cupcakes
in a few months.

14:40.247 --> 14:43.249
What am I supposed to do? You think
I'm gonna find another buyer, man?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.960
Look at that guy.

14:47.588 --> 14:49.088
They say a house chooses you.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.426
I've never heard that.

14:50.437 --> 14:52.508
Do you know if these floors
are sloped or flat?

14:52.509 --> 14:54.427
Would blood pool or run?

14:54.428 --> 14:56.262
Can I see a copy of the survey report?

14:56.263 --> 14:58.389
Uh, yeah, of course, dude.
I got one right here.

14:58.390 --> 14:59.391
OK.

15:00.976 --> 15:02.112
I thought I had it. Um...

15:02.123 --> 15:04.354
I can just run to my office
and print up another one.

15:04.355 --> 15:06.189
Feel free to hang out.

15:06.190 --> 15:08.691
Don't turn Esther into a jacket,
I'll be right back!

15:08.692 --> 15:11.986
No problem. I'll stay here and test
out how scream-proof the walls are.

15:11.987 --> 15:14.572
- Cool.
- I guess I'll keep him company.

15:14.573 --> 15:17.002
and say goodbye to Elma's spirit
for one last time.

15:17.013 --> 15:18.393
Thank you. Yeah, if he gets bored,

15:18.404 --> 15:20.705
maybe grab some of those
doll heads out of the basement.

15:20.716 --> 15:21.921
Let him pet their hair, or...

15:21.932 --> 15:23.748
- You got it.
- See ya!

15:23.749 --> 15:27.293
James, I thought maybe
I could just sit down with you

15:27.294 --> 15:28.836
and give you a little presentation

15:28.837 --> 15:31.339
on some of the commercial
possibilities for this property.

15:31.340 --> 15:33.675
That's the survey report right there.

15:33.676 --> 15:37.553
Oh! How did Benji's papers
get mixed in with my prospectus?

15:37.554 --> 15:39.305
Here we are, in a house of mystery.

15:40.724 --> 15:43.101
So, as you can see,
this isn't just real estate.

15:43.102 --> 15:45.937
This is a multi-platform
franchise opportunity.

15:45.938 --> 15:48.983
With products. Like this murder mallet.

15:50.609 --> 15:53.352
This Elma bobblehead
that bleeds realistic blood.

15:53.363 --> 15:56.198
We're waiting on approval from her
estate, but we think we'll get it.

15:57.366 --> 15:59.367
Fascinating.

15:59.368 --> 16:03.329
But, you know, I must confess.
I'm not here to buy this house.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.415
Let's just say I'm a lot closer

16:05.416 --> 16:07.584
to this murder than you'd imagine.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.716
I'm sorry, do you have
diplomatic immunity?

16:14.717 --> 16:16.134
Can you just block a driveway?

16:16.135 --> 16:17.384
OK, tone it down, Willow.

16:17.395 --> 16:19.220
You can't just park wherever you want.

16:19.221 --> 16:21.180
There's rules. Of driving and parking.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.224
Hey. It's OK.

16:23.225 --> 16:26.102
I'm here to talk about
a partnership, OK?

16:26.103 --> 16:27.603
I need you. Uh... Your little house

16:27.604 --> 16:29.230
has been gettin' a lot of buzz.

16:29.231 --> 16:31.357
Oh, that's great. We've been
working real hard on it,

16:31.358 --> 16:35.945
but unfortunately, we gotta end our
murder business. I gotta sell the house.

16:35.946 --> 16:38.656
What? You don't just end
a murder business.

16:38.657 --> 16:40.199
I want you on this tour.

16:40.200 --> 16:42.243
I'm gonna bring three busloads
of people a day,

16:42.244 --> 16:44.120
they're gonna be buying stuff.

16:44.121 --> 16:46.816
I hear the guy playin' the
brother is outstanding.

16:46.827 --> 16:48.544
Are you tryin'
to butter me up right now?

16:48.555 --> 16:50.335
- You know I play the brother, right?
- I am.

16:50.336 --> 16:51.711
I'm just good with characters.

16:51.712 --> 16:54.630
I went to international summer camp,
so dialects just flow out of me.

16:54.631 --> 16:57.428
That's all they're talkin' about, is you.

17:01.305 --> 17:02.764
Get away from her!

17:05.642 --> 17:08.144
- What are you doing?
- Saving you.

17:08.145 --> 17:09.645
We're in the middle of a reenactment,

17:09.646 --> 17:10.896
and now we have to start over.

17:10.897 --> 17:12.272
James, back to one.

17:12.273 --> 17:14.733
Wow. This is a good murder house!

17:14.734 --> 17:18.279
Shoe thing was a little over the
top, but we can workshop that.

17:18.280 --> 17:20.281
This is my life's work. I'm Esther.

17:20.281 --> 17:23.242
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
So, you're a journalist?

17:23.242 --> 17:25.204
Yeah, sorry I had to string you along,

17:25.214 --> 17:27.518
but I needed to get in the house
to test out my theories.

17:27.529 --> 17:29.332
But I'm never gonna
publish this book anyway,

17:29.333 --> 17:30.792
because it doesn't add up.

17:30.793 --> 17:32.418
I can't even find the murder weapon.

17:32.419 --> 17:33.684
Well, the mallet

17:33.695 --> 17:35.880
or the bronze schnauzer statue,
that's my theory.

17:35.881 --> 17:38.716
No, the angle's all wrong.
See, there's nothing in this house

17:38.717 --> 17:40.028
that matches her injuries.

17:40.039 --> 17:41.886
And frankly, killing somebody
with a calculator

17:41.887 --> 17:43.638
felt like the weakest part of your show.

17:43.639 --> 17:45.807
And it's the weakest part
of your merchandising plan.

17:45.808 --> 17:48.267
Guys, I'm a new business, OK?

17:48.268 --> 17:50.812
Knock knock. Hey. I'm just
here to take some pictures.

17:50.813 --> 17:53.523
My uncle, he's a personal injury
lawyer, and he told me to.

17:53.524 --> 17:55.108
You'll be served with papers soon.

17:55.109 --> 17:58.486
Jeffrey! My uncle is an alcoholic,
and I haven't seen him in two years.

17:58.487 --> 18:00.738
How dare you say the word "uncle"?

18:00.739 --> 18:03.491
Look, I'm sorry you're hurt, Jeff,
but I don't have any money.

18:03.492 --> 18:04.751
And I gave you stage credit!

18:04.762 --> 18:07.025
Yeah, but if I hadn't been
in your little crazy show,

18:07.036 --> 18:09.978
then a jar of old lady honey wouldn't
have fallen and hit me on the head.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.119
W-what jar of honey?

18:11.130 --> 18:13.376
Oh, there's this jar of honey
with a human heart in it.

18:13.377 --> 18:14.448
- What?
- I'm just kidding.

18:14.459 --> 18:16.996
I know you're into weird stuff.
It's just got a honeycomb in it.

18:17.007 --> 18:19.709
I don't remember reading about a jar
of honey in the police reports.

18:19.720 --> 18:20.860
Oh, they probably missed it.

18:20.871 --> 18:22.654
It was on a really high shelf
in the pantry.

18:22.665 --> 18:25.346
High shelf in the pantry. Wait a minute!

18:25.347 --> 18:30.810
OK, Esther, you're Elma,
fixing a late night cup of tea.

18:30.811 --> 18:33.479
"I have an itch
only chamomile can scratch."

18:33.480 --> 18:37.150
You head to the pantry, where
you keep a large jar of honey.

18:37.151 --> 18:40.236
Seriously, this is why bee colonies
are failing. That's a lotta honey.

18:40.237 --> 18:42.822
But your lust for the sweet
things in life was your undoing.

18:42.823 --> 18:45.409
As you fumble for the honey, it
falls, hitting you on the head.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.744
- Bang!
- Aah!

18:47.745 --> 18:49.120
Stunned and confused,

18:49.121 --> 18:50.913
Elma puts the jar back on the shelf.

18:50.914 --> 18:53.332
The police don't notice it.
It's never seen again,

18:53.333 --> 18:55.960
- until it hits your
friend on the head. -Uh!

18:55.961 --> 18:59.505
Elma doesn't know it yet,
but she's already dead.

18:59.506 --> 19:01.048
And then, the schnauzer.

19:01.049 --> 19:02.717
No.

19:02.718 --> 19:04.844
Bleeding everywhere, Elma wanders,

19:04.845 --> 19:07.388
disoriented, into the living room.

19:07.389 --> 19:11.642
She heads towards the TV to stream
season two of "True Detective."

19:11.643 --> 19:13.394
But mercifully, she dies.

19:13.395 --> 19:14.897
Ooh!

19:17.065 --> 19:20.568
So you're saying the killer
was a late-night sweet craving?

19:20.569 --> 19:22.403
I'm saying, this was a random accident.

19:22.404 --> 19:25.364
There goes my book. I'll be lucky
to get a blog post outta this.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.201
Whoa, whoa, hold up.
There was no murder?

19:28.202 --> 19:30.787
Hey, I'm out. That's a damn shame.

19:30.788 --> 19:32.914
This was gonna bump
Fatty Arbuckle from my tour.

19:32.915 --> 19:35.847
Parking by his place is a bitch! Peace.

19:35.858 --> 19:38.461
This isn't a murder house. This
is just a regular death house.

19:38.462 --> 19:39.962
I can sell that tomorrow!

19:39.963 --> 19:43.549
Dean is going to fist-bump me
repeatedly.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.185
Well... can I name your blog post?

19:46.196 --> 19:48.387
- Sure, what do you got?
- "Murder, She Wasn't."

19:48.388 --> 19:50.306
No. It's not very good.

19:50.307 --> 19:51.517
OK.

19:53.644 --> 19:56.562
Esther, you're credited as
an "amateur murder enthusiast."

19:56.563 --> 19:58.815
- What? Amateur? -I'd say
that pretty much sums it up.

19:58.816 --> 20:02.360
I am certainly not an amateur.
I was paid $500 for my work.

20:02.361 --> 20:04.570
Well, I made $200 if you factor in

20:04.571 --> 20:07.865
the party store's fascist return
policy for used fog machines.

20:07.866 --> 20:11.118
Guys, I can't lie.
I'm feelin' a little woozy.

20:11.119 --> 20:14.163
Benj, could you help me to your room,
so I could lay down for a second?

20:14.164 --> 20:15.866
- Yeah, sure, bud.
- Whoo!

20:15.877 --> 20:17.708
We make good crutches,
'cause we're more or less

20:17.709 --> 20:18.709
- the same height. You like that?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:18.710 --> 20:21.380
I mean, I'm a better crutch,
'cause my shoulder's a little softer.

20:21.391 --> 20:23.047
- I retain water there.
- They're very delicate.

20:23.048 --> 20:25.677
Pride's a tricky thing for you.
The things you brag about and don't...

20:27.052 --> 20:29.762
I told you it was scary!

20:29.763 --> 20:31.389
- No, it wasn't.
- Nice work.

20:31.390 --> 20:33.933
I feel like I should pursue horror.

20:33.934 --> 20:35.476
- Yeah!
- I felt really good

20:35.477 --> 20:36.561
about my performance.

20:36.562 --> 20:37.562
It's a good niche.

20:37.563 --> 20:38.906
I'm gonna go home.

20:38.917 --> 20:40.596
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

20:40.607 --> 20:43.442
That means she pissed herself.
Are you guys happy? I wasn't scared.

20:43.443 --> 20:46.362
I can handle it, but you know she can't.

20:46.363 --> 20:48.240
Really disappointed.
