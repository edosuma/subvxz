WEBVTT

00:02.753 --> 00:04.546
Ugh, damn it.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.131
Ugh.

00:06.423 --> 00:08.090
Come on. Oh, Elroy.

00:08.383 --> 00:09.760
Elroy, hey.

00:12.429 --> 00:13.889
Computer no worky.

00:14.181 --> 00:16.140
Please don't do that.

00:16.433 --> 00:17.434
Computer no worky.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.228
Did you forget
your password again?

00:19.520 --> 00:22.160
Pelton, I can't keep track of all
the parakeets you had growing up.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.399
This is different.
No matter what I do,

00:24.691 --> 00:26.735
I get the same error. Which one?

00:27.027 --> 00:29.446
"You have been owned
by Elite Fleet 69."

00:29.738 --> 00:32.073
"Our hacks are all up
in your systems."

00:32.366 --> 00:33.766
I'm not bothering
to pronounce them,

00:33.867 --> 00:35.410
but there are a lot
of Zs being used.

00:38.664 --> 00:39.664
Oh, crap.

00:39.831 --> 00:41.500
What?

00:41.792 --> 00:44.586
Is there another
Mask movie coming out?

00:44.878 --> 00:46.588
The school's been hacked. What?

00:46.880 --> 00:49.132
How can we stop it? It's too late.
It's happened.

00:49.424 --> 00:53.136
Uh, no parlo hablo too late
at Greendale, Elroy.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.222
There's always something
that can be done.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.994
You know, I wasn't
gonna say anything,

00:57.182 --> 00:59.309
but you could cut the
hardline at the mainframe.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.061
Hardline. Mainframe!

01:02.354 --> 01:03.605
Get out of my way.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.617
I have to cut the hardline
on the mainframe!

01:05.649 --> 01:08.277
Clear a path to the mainframe!

01:08.569 --> 01:12.614
I have to cut the hard... line.

01:13.991 --> 01:14.992
You were being sarcastic.

01:15.284 --> 01:18.287
Yeah, but you should
look at this.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.330
"Cancel your
offensive performance."

01:20.622 --> 01:22.040
"You know the one we mean."

01:22.332 --> 01:23.917
"We have all your information."

01:24.209 --> 01:27.337
"If you do not cancel
this hateful comedy show,"

01:27.629 --> 01:30.007
"you will taste our power
in this way."

01:30.299 --> 01:31.633
There's a link. Don't click it.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.595
Or what, the green skull
will get a virus?

01:35.804 --> 01:37.306
My God.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.016
It's the lunch lady's emails.

01:39.308 --> 01:42.686
It's all the lunch
lady's emails.

01:42.978 --> 01:44.313
Which lunch lady?

01:44.605 --> 01:47.316
The hot one?

01:47.608 --> 01:49.651
You mean the one
who serves the hot food?

01:49.943 --> 01:52.404
Mmm, that's the one.

01:54.156 --> 01:57.159

02:33.111 --> 02:34.831
Please tell me you guys
aren't sitting there

02:35.113 --> 02:36.948
reading the lunch lady's
leaked emails.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.825
No one here could ever do that.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.912
I mean, not even in shifts.
It's decades of data.

02:42.204 --> 02:45.124
I'm reading the Greendale Gazette's
highlights of the lunch lady's emails.

02:45.248 --> 02:46.517
I found a torrent
of all the highlights

02:46.541 --> 02:47.852
if you don't want to wait
for the ads to load.

02:47.876 --> 02:48.960
Abed, that's stealing.

02:49.252 --> 02:50.855
Those ads are there so
the Gazette can pay people

02:50.879 --> 02:52.315
to go through
the lunch lady's emails.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.341
Not to get too liberal,
but once they're online,

02:54.633 --> 02:57.010
does anyone really own
the lunch lady's emails?

02:57.302 --> 02:59.596
That's why the future of the
internet is branded content.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.766
Wazzledazzle.com's
got five Bacardi cocktails

03:03.058 --> 03:05.227
inspired by the lunch lady's
most embarrassing secrets.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.728
Ooh.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.563
You guys
are violating her privacy.

03:08.855 --> 03:11.191
Uh, I'm pretty sure the
media's doing that, Britta.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.693
We're just reading the news.

03:12.984 --> 03:17.280
The police are here about
our computers being hacked.

03:17.572 --> 03:21.076
Hi, guys. I see a few familiar faces here.
A few new ones as well.

03:22.994 --> 03:25.247
No, just gonna keep the cop
you've known for five years

03:25.539 --> 03:26.790
at arm's length. I get it.

03:27.082 --> 03:28.643
What have you boys
been able to figure out?

03:28.667 --> 03:30.347
Don't call us boys,
and it's a unique case,

03:30.544 --> 03:33.338
because it's hard to decide
what laws are being broken.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.382
Unless you count the lunch
lady's sex life.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.304
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.224
Anyway, our city does have
a cybercrime division,

03:44.516 --> 03:47.436
but it's... well,
it's pretty new.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.521
Any leads, Officer Warburton?

03:49.813 --> 03:51.690
I want McDonald's.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.860
Wants McDonald's.

03:55.152 --> 03:56.921
Assuming you probably can't see
from where you're sitting,

03:56.945 --> 03:59.698
it's literally a child in an
adult size police uniform.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.908
It's cute, but it doesn't
help our situation.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.869
So what do we make
of the demands?

04:04.161 --> 04:05.921
Well, we were able
to find out a little more.

04:05.996 --> 04:09.458
This message was posted online
and signed "the hackers,"

04:09.750 --> 04:11.042
and we assume it's legit

04:11.334 --> 04:13.712
because, well, that's
just where we're at.

04:14.004 --> 04:15.338
"Greendale,
cancel the performance

04:15.630 --> 04:18.216
"of the terrorist comedian
Gupta Gupti Gupta,

04:18.507 --> 04:21.344
who seeks to spread hatred
with his hateful comedy."

04:21.636 --> 04:23.555
You guys booked
Gupta Gupti Gupta?

04:23.847 --> 04:26.183
Oh, my god, Dean.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.310
He's renowned
for his racist act.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.979
How can he be racist?
Listen to his name.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.982
Well, the message says if you
don't cancel his performance,

04:34.274 --> 04:36.002
what happened to the lunch
lady's going to happen

04:36.026 --> 04:37.586
to everyone
on the activities committee.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.488
Ha, we don't have a...

04:39.780 --> 04:41.740
Oh, God, that's us.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.909
So what do we do?
That's up to the school.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.801
Now, I'm just a cop born in a small
town, raised in the heartland,

04:47.078 --> 04:48.358
but I say cancel
the performance,

04:48.538 --> 04:50.578
and give the government
the sweeping powers it needs

04:50.707 --> 04:53.126
to detect and eliminate people
before they turn into hackers.

04:53.418 --> 04:54.795
Think that's all I've got.

04:55.086 --> 04:56.379
How's everything otherwise?

04:56.671 --> 04:57.923
Stoked for Avengers? Avengers?

04:58.215 --> 04:59.215
Avengers?

04:59.341 --> 05:00.634
Avengers?

05:00.926 --> 05:02.646
I hear Marvel got really
hands-on this time.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.614
They really pinned
in Joss Whedon creatively,

05:04.638 --> 05:06.515
so how could that go wrong?

05:06.807 --> 05:08.350
Okay, see ya.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.687
I guess I'm gonna
call a press conference

05:12.979 --> 05:15.816
and announce the comedy is canceled.
Wait, hold on.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.487
What's that?

05:20.779 --> 05:22.239
Do your thing. Inspire them.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.531
To do what?

05:23.698 --> 05:25.200
To rise to the occasion.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.410
To not let these hackers
push us around.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.706
Don't you guys think that
we have an obligation here?

05:31.998 --> 05:33.542
The cop says no.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.211
Well, the cop
say that your car trunk

05:36.503 --> 05:37.838
has something to do with 9/11.

05:38.129 --> 05:39.130
They're not philosophers.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.742
They're crossing guards
with guns.

05:40.799 --> 05:42.300
This is on us as a committee.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.052
The eyes of the world are...

05:44.344 --> 05:46.137
Aren't within hundreds
of miles of this room.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.189
Okay, how about the eyes
of something bigger?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.976
Aren't you an atheist? Don't
you hate this government?

05:51.268 --> 05:53.228
Are you even planning
on going to see this comic?

05:53.520 --> 05:55.480
Yes, pretty much,
and of course not.

05:55.772 --> 05:57.399
I was planning to protest him,

05:57.691 --> 06:00.277
but I can't believe
I'm the one saying this.

06:00.569 --> 06:02.571
For God's sake,
we're frickin' Americans.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.531
We're talking about
freedom of speech.

06:04.823 --> 06:06.116
It's the amendment so important,

06:06.408 --> 06:08.618
it's literally the first one
they remembered to add.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.495
For white people. With penises.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.582
We prefer to be called people
without color or vaginas.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.334
Look, I know some things
have gotten too simple,

06:16.626 --> 06:18.386
and other things
have gotten too complicated,

06:18.503 --> 06:20.881
but we still have a legacy
and a job in this country.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.966
We're the colony
so high-maintenance

06:23.258 --> 06:24.509
the British gave up.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.679
We're so obnoxious,
the French sent us a statue.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.931
Nobody tells us to shut up,

06:30.223 --> 06:33.059
and yes, I know that our wealth
is no longer distributed,

06:33.351 --> 06:35.562
and yes, our democracy
has been hijacked

06:35.854 --> 06:38.273
and turned into a puppet show
about two fake parties

06:38.565 --> 06:40.365
that are controlled by
a cartel of monopolies,

06:40.525 --> 06:43.236
and yes, if our votes had any real
power, they'd be illegal, but...

06:43.528 --> 06:47.490
Britta! Freedom of speech
acknowledged. Trust us.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.451
Cancel the show
and you cancel people.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.103
Might as well bring
dinosaurs back.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.704
What? Let her finish.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.876
Britta, you saw what they
did to the lunch lady.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.584
You want to guess how much
better my emails are?

06:57.876 --> 07:00.670
You want me to call a press
conference and say, "Now do me"?

07:00.962 --> 07:02.756
No. I'll do it.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.926
Let them leak me.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.431
I'm not letting
you do this alone.

07:12.641 --> 07:13.767
Screw it.

07:14.559 --> 07:15.644
I'm in.

07:17.312 --> 07:18.873
Someone has to be
the last one to stand up,

07:18.897 --> 07:20.106
and now that someone isn't me.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.992
I kind of zoned out
and assumed we're standing

07:24.110 --> 07:25.278
to go see Avengers?

07:25.570 --> 07:27.656
These guys are giving
hackers a bad name,

07:27.948 --> 07:30.784
and hacker is already
such a dumb name.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.662
I'm not an idealist.
I'm a pragmatist,

07:33.954 --> 07:38.750
and it's never pragmatic to
piss you guys off, so fine.

07:39.042 --> 07:40.335
Guys,

07:40.627 --> 07:42.253
this is so inspiring.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.340
I guess just let me
know how it goes.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.276
No matter what happens,
I'm with you, but...

07:47.300 --> 07:49.570
but don't tell anyone I'm with you.
If you do, I'll deny it,

07:49.594 --> 07:51.221
but I'm with you here and now.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.449
Not literally here and now.
Right now I'm leaving,

07:53.473 --> 07:56.559
but I will always
have been with you secretly.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.020
Bye.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.856
The performance by
Gupta Gupti Gupta

08:02.148 --> 08:04.192
will go on as scheduled
tomorrow night,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.987
and we encourage anyone
who believes in freedom

08:07.278 --> 08:09.197
to attend
Mr. Gupta's performance.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.367
Although, as a woman and someone
with many Jewish and black friends,

08:12.659 --> 08:16.371
I will be deeply offended and
petitioning to have Mr. Gupta

08:16.663 --> 08:18.540
banned from all campuses
across America,

08:18.832 --> 08:20.542
but one thing at a time.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.043
First, freedom of speech

08:22.335 --> 08:24.504
does not just apply to speech
you want to hear.

08:24.796 --> 08:26.673
Case in point. Am I right?

08:26.965 --> 08:28.883
Stephanie, get my good side.
Right here.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.511
Oh, I'm being censored.
I'm being censored!

08:31.803 --> 08:34.443
Anyway, there's coffee and scotch
in the corner. Screw the hackers,

08:34.681 --> 08:36.640
and long live Greendale. Yay!

08:36.933 --> 08:38.809
Whoo! Whoo.

08:41.479 --> 08:42.856
All right, I'll see you guys

08:43.148 --> 08:44.748
at sound check
in the cafeteria tomorrow.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.942
And there is a good chance

08:46.234 --> 08:47.514
that we are going
to be targeted,

08:47.777 --> 08:50.071
so nobody gets on the internet tonight.
What do we say?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.740
No peeking at the leaking.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.072
Promise, promise, promise?

08:53.324 --> 08:54.492
Okay.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.704
Jeff. Hmm?

08:57.996 --> 08:59.914
Thank you for backing me up
a little.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.375
Well, you turned it into the
path of least resistance.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.229
Deflect all you want, but you're putting
your ass on the line for an ideal.

09:05.253 --> 09:07.922
Well, maybe a fraction of
a butt cheek on the line.

09:08.214 --> 09:10.317
I mean, it's not like I use
that stupid Greendale email

09:10.341 --> 09:11.701
for anything
but porn subscriptions

09:11.843 --> 09:13.511
and improv show mailing lists.

09:13.803 --> 09:14.929
What makes you think

09:15.221 --> 09:17.223
it's only your Greendale
email they'll be leaking?

09:17.515 --> 09:19.768
Because they hacked Greendale.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.420
You have a computer
in your office?

09:21.561 --> 09:22.729
Yes.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.661
Do you check your emails
on that computer?

09:24.731 --> 09:25.732
Uh-huh.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.567
You look at boobies on it?

09:28.777 --> 09:30.028
One time.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.947
They got it.
They got everything.

09:36.117 --> 09:39.287
It's Vietnam now, baby.
It's Vietnam!

09:45.126 --> 09:47.420
Anyways, like I said, thanks.

10:11.820 --> 10:12.904
Hello.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.196
Hello.

10:24.582 --> 10:25.583
Girls.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.752
Frankie. Francesca.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.505
Word around school is our
emails have been leaked.

10:30.797 --> 10:31.881
Is that so?

10:32.173 --> 10:34.008
Oh? The first
you've heard of it?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.010
I guess I heard some rumblings.

10:36.302 --> 10:37.512
Hmm, rumblings.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.305
Hmm. Hmm.

10:46.396 --> 10:48.648
Hello, Jeff. Hello, Jeff.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.942
Jeff Winger.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.360
Annie.

10:52.652 --> 10:53.945
Britta.

10:54.237 --> 10:55.237
Frankie.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.540
I hear the hackers
leaked our emails.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.293
Yes. I heard
something like that.

11:08.585 --> 11:09.836
Should we help set up chairs?

11:10.128 --> 11:11.337
Sure.

11:24.267 --> 11:26.352
Something was wrong
with that one.

11:26.644 --> 11:27.896
Bad chair.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.773
Hi, how's everybody doing?

11:31.065 --> 11:32.192
I asked a damn question.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.402
Fine. New look?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.321
I'm glad you like it.

11:36.613 --> 11:39.258
I'd hate to think my wardrobe wasn't
passing muster with this group,

11:39.282 --> 11:41.201
so here I am
in a brand-new outfit

11:41.492 --> 11:43.161
with an up-to-the-minute shirt.

11:43.453 --> 11:46.056
Okay, I'm not usually the best at
nonverbal cues, so I have to ask.

11:46.080 --> 11:47.640
Is it possible that
everyone here but me

11:47.749 --> 11:49.018
read all of each other's
leaked emails?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.585
It's possible.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.964
I read it all!
I read all your crap!

11:56.424 --> 11:57.717
I have read everything

11:58.009 --> 12:00.637
you guys have ever
wrote about me in an email,

12:00.929 --> 12:04.307
and you guys are the worst
people in the world.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.935
Screw you guys! Not cool!

12:07.227 --> 12:09.479
Mean! Mean! Mean!

12:09.771 --> 12:11.051
Point it at me
and I will eat it!

12:11.105 --> 12:12.665
What? I will bite your
little finger off

12:12.857 --> 12:13.857
and I will eat it.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.236
Then let's see you type
more descriptions of my.

12:16.527 --> 12:18.279
"Houseguest era
Sinbad wardrobe."

12:18.571 --> 12:19.571
Aha!

12:19.822 --> 12:22.158
That's a direct quote
from a really mean email

12:22.450 --> 12:24.953
I wrote about him,
so now who's the bad guy?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.723
Okay, how much of the leak did each of
you read? I have a right to fit in!

12:27.747 --> 12:30.187
Okay, stop it. Stop it. Why don't
we all just admit that we...

12:30.416 --> 12:31.751
I'm not admitting it.
Oh, please.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.462
Come on. Oh, Annie, get over it.

12:34.754 --> 12:38.591
You had my blood
tested for amphetamines?

12:38.883 --> 12:40.969
You were extra jumpy
last spring,

12:41.261 --> 12:42.655
and we had to double check
to be safe.

12:42.679 --> 12:43.972
I don't think I'm jumpy enough

12:44.264 --> 12:46.516
if my friends
can steal my blood.

12:46.808 --> 12:48.768
Oh, you gave it to us.

12:49.060 --> 12:50.812
For that human genome project?

12:51.104 --> 12:52.522
We only used half
of it for that.

12:52.814 --> 12:54.174
By the way,
you're 1 % Neanderthal.

12:54.232 --> 12:55.441
Ew.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.694
How can you judge anyone,
light switch licker.

12:57.986 --> 12:59.362
Like this. Ew.

12:59.654 --> 13:00.738
You guys hear that sound?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.367
That is the sound
of the hackers winning.

13:04.659 --> 13:05.952
Our school
is out there right now

13:06.244 --> 13:09.122
pawing through our dirty
laundry, laughing at us,

13:09.414 --> 13:11.207
waiting to see
what we're gonna do.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.043
Waiting to see
who wins in the battle

13:14.335 --> 13:16.629
between terror and cool.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.507
We got to be cool, man.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.509
We got to be cool...

13:25.680 --> 13:27.432
and set up for a show.

13:29.934 --> 13:32.103
Abed, if you
wouldn't mind, please,

13:32.395 --> 13:34.147
checking the sound system.
No problem.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.000
Unless you're too busy
telling your girlfriend

13:36.024 --> 13:37.304
I don't understand Donnie Darko.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.861
Annie. I'm cool.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.571
I'll set up the box office.

13:43.531 --> 13:45.616
Oh, oh, or will me opening

13:45.908 --> 13:49.704
a box office unfairly influence
wagers in your betting pool

13:49.996 --> 13:51.831
about my sexual preference.

13:52.123 --> 13:55.043
We saw this one coming,
and we are so sorry.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.375
Oh, that cuts it. The word
"sorry" fills that crater

13:57.628 --> 13:58.796
right to the brim, yeah.

13:59.088 --> 14:00.757
Oh, boo hoo,

14:01.049 --> 14:02.925
your friends are curious
about your night life.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.927
We kept it among friends.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.262
You told human resources

14:06.554 --> 14:08.639
I was a "functional alcoholic."

14:08.931 --> 14:11.934
I am required to file a
report on every teacher,

14:12.226 --> 14:14.771
and if you throw another
tantrum, I will revise yours.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.814
To what? Nonlethal murderer?

14:17.106 --> 14:18.941
Armless javelin thrower?

14:19.233 --> 14:21.069
What in your unqualified,

14:21.361 --> 14:24.113
buzzword-bloated, little
red schoolhouse of a brain

14:24.405 --> 14:26.199
is a functional alcoholic?

14:26.491 --> 14:28.701
What in your brain
is a "chapstick lesbian"?

14:28.993 --> 14:31.412
To me? 300 bucks, unless
you care to refute it.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.123
My sexuality is of zero concern

14:34.415 --> 14:36.292
to my job and to everyone here.

14:36.584 --> 14:38.294
I swear, if you people
were trapped

14:38.586 --> 14:40.004
on a tiger-infested island

14:40.296 --> 14:41.297
with no food or water,

14:41.589 --> 14:45.093
you would judge every ship
that came to save you.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.887
How do the tigers survive
without food or water?

14:48.179 --> 14:50.056
Oh, it's not cute, Annie,

14:50.348 --> 14:51.808
and I read your entry
in the pool.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.143
Was your goal to win
or just be disgusting?

14:55.353 --> 14:57.480
I had to pick last!

14:57.772 --> 14:59.649
Yeah, well, we all
read about ourselves

14:59.941 --> 15:02.443
in your weirdly long melodramatic
emails to your sister,

15:02.735 --> 15:05.530
who you might notice never responds.
Take a hint.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.490
She's dead.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.703
I pretend to write her emails

15:12.995 --> 15:14.831
as a journaling device,

15:15.123 --> 15:18.543
you wretched,
invasive little gremlin!

15:18.835 --> 15:21.963
Okay, why don't we just
call that rock bottom.

15:22.255 --> 15:25.925
Check one. Check two.

15:26.217 --> 15:27.552
Well, well, well.

15:27.844 --> 15:30.346
It looks like Jeff Winger ought
to pay his car insurance,

15:30.638 --> 15:33.683
and Annie's book club
has a meeting tomorrow.

15:33.975 --> 15:36.853
Where did you guys
find the bad stuff?

15:37.145 --> 15:39.397
Maybe... maybe what we
all need to do here

15:39.689 --> 15:41.774
is have everyone in the
room address and own

15:42.066 --> 15:44.527
one thing that they know is out there.
No blame. No shame.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.112
Just an explanation.

15:46.404 --> 15:47.404
I'll start.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.495
Now, I'm sure by now
you've all seen the emails

15:49.574 --> 15:51.951
between me and the Patterson
family of Herndon, Virginia.

15:52.243 --> 15:53.453
Not me. No.

15:53.744 --> 15:56.831
I received their first letter
as part of a family email chain

15:57.123 --> 15:59.000
Christmas of 2007.
I don't think you owe us...

15:59.292 --> 16:02.128
Although I didn't understand
why they had written me,

16:02.420 --> 16:04.172
I responded politely.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.049
When I realized they had somehow
mistaken me for their cousin,

16:07.341 --> 16:10.219
for some reason,
I suppose it was loneliness,

16:10.511 --> 16:13.181
I simply failed to disabuse
them of that notion.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.183
- Well, that's...
- I've come to love

16:15.475 --> 16:18.394
Barb and George
and Jelson and Riselle

16:18.686 --> 16:22.190
and even Uncle Paul with
all his flaws...

16:22.482 --> 16:24.942
and even though our
relationship is based on a lie,

16:25.234 --> 16:29.572
for me it's one of the
realest I'll ever know.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.156
Aw!

16:33.367 --> 16:35.328
I hope you don't think
by explaining that

16:35.620 --> 16:38.164
you're off the hook for the
3D models you've been making

16:38.456 --> 16:40.583
of our bodies
without our permission.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.294
That's what those
photos were for?

16:43.586 --> 16:45.796
I'm making a game
about lady time travelers.

16:46.088 --> 16:47.798
Where, in your pants?

16:48.090 --> 16:49.342
It's pretty creepy, Elroy.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.594
Oh, you guys are so suave.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.596
You're such gentlemen.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.848
You and Chang
have a daily email chain

16:56.140 --> 16:57.975
ranking Annie and Britta
one and two.

16:58.267 --> 17:00.019
By which you mean
Chang emails me

17:00.311 --> 17:02.230
rankings every day,
and I don't respond.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.317
Uh, except for February 7, 2013.

17:06.608 --> 17:08.694
Chang, "Britta is one.
Annie is two."

17:08.986 --> 17:10.445
Jeff, "Ha, yeah."

17:11.071 --> 17:12.865
Jeff, gross,

17:13.156 --> 17:15.242
and, Britta, way to instantly
memorize the exact date

17:15.535 --> 17:16.743
of your big victory.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.579
Hey, silver and gold, ladies.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.540
Ain't no losers there.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.911
Okay, I think we're losing
sight of what's important.

17:23.084 --> 17:25.294
Says the woman
suing her father for $80.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.380
Tell it to your fake family.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.800
Have you made any creepy
boob models of Giselle yet?

17:31.092 --> 17:32.552
Riselle is like
a daughter to me!

17:32.843 --> 17:36.305
But arguably more like
a daughter to her parents.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.891
Didn't you have your own family?

17:39.183 --> 17:41.102
Oh, go write an astronaut.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.594
Did anyone see Jeff's letters?

17:42.812 --> 17:45.648
He writes to astronauts.
Talk about creepy.

17:45.940 --> 17:46.983
They're national heroes!

17:47.275 --> 17:48.985
Yes, they are! Leave 'em alone!

17:49.277 --> 17:50.403
Oh, this I got to see.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.015
You know
what I don't want to see?

17:52.196 --> 17:53.948
Your exchanges
with your life coach

17:54.240 --> 17:55.880
about the study group
when we were dating.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.327
Oh, and by the way,
clearly not a life coach

17:58.619 --> 18:01.247
and absolutely just
an Italian sociopath

18:01.539 --> 18:02.915
you met at a dispensary.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.709
You two dated?

18:05.001 --> 18:06.002
This was a study group?

18:06.294 --> 18:07.420
Yeah, Chang was our teacher.

18:07.712 --> 18:09.422
What? That's right,

18:09.714 --> 18:12.675
and frankly, haven't been
well-utilized since.

18:16.012 --> 18:17.388
"Dear Reid Wiseman,

18:17.680 --> 18:19.658
congratulations on your
successful return to Earth."

18:19.682 --> 18:21.017
A lady time traveling
video game?

18:21.309 --> 18:22.560
"How was Halloween in space."

18:22.852 --> 18:24.687
"Emilio, I tried what you said."

18:26.564 --> 18:27.690
"Dear Neil Armstrong,"

18:27.982 --> 18:29.567
I love you more than my dad.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.194
"I would die
if you gave me a hug."

18:32.486 --> 18:34.113
- Hey, guys.
- What?

18:35.531 --> 18:37.199
This is Gupta Gupti Gupta.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.160
Yeah, hi. Fine, whatever.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.703
Congratulations.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.163
You guys okay?

18:42.455 --> 18:43.831
To tell you the truth,
Gupta Gupti,

18:44.123 --> 18:45.475
we've been through a bit
of a rough patch.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.019
Yeah, the dean
was telling me about it,

18:47.168 --> 18:49.045
and I've been reading about it.

18:49.337 --> 18:51.172
Hope you were entertained.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.507
To be honest,
I'm really grateful.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.888
This is the first school in six
months that hasn't canceled,

18:59.180 --> 19:00.180
so thanks.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.684
I'm gonna go get ready.

19:08.939 --> 19:10.900
We really did the right thing,
didn't we?

19:11.192 --> 19:13.903
Yeah, it doesn't matter
what we read in the leaks

19:14.195 --> 19:15.821
or what we said
to each other tonight.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.532
What matters is that right
now, here on this campus,

19:18.824 --> 19:19.992
the people are in charge.

19:20.284 --> 19:21.452
Not the hackers.

19:21.744 --> 19:22.870
Not the media.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.914
Not the cops. The people.

19:25.206 --> 19:26.374
Abed, go put on some music.

19:26.666 --> 19:28.668
Elroy, Jeff,
put out some more chairs.

19:28.959 --> 19:30.836
Annie, get ready
to introduce our star.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.089
Chang, go talk to yourself
in the corner.

19:33.381 --> 19:35.299
Frankie, let the people in.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.688
Hey. Hi.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.203
Hey, Neil. Hey.

20:04.495 --> 20:07.331
That's the whole audience? I...

20:07.623 --> 20:09.291
I can't do a show
for one person.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.627
Well, you kind of have to.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.254
But I'd rather not.

20:13.546 --> 20:14.839
Well, you have to, jackass,

20:15.131 --> 20:17.531
because there's more at stake
here than what you'd rather do.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.431
Oh, God.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.867
There's a new message from the hackers.
Everyone, quiet down.

20:25.891 --> 20:26.976
Abed, cut the music.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.996
"People of Greendale,
your activities committee"

20:30.020 --> 20:31.020
"has defied our demands,"

20:31.188 --> 20:32.565
"and the horrible
racist comedian"

20:32.857 --> 20:33.977
"is still about to perform."

20:34.150 --> 20:35.985
Yeah, that's right. We beat you.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.112
"If this performance
goes on as scheduled,"

20:38.404 --> 20:40.531
"all of your information
will be published."

20:40.823 --> 20:42.700
"If you do not want
this to happen,"

20:42.992 --> 20:45.661
"you will find a way
to stop this performance."

20:47.913 --> 20:49.290
Whoa. Stop, stop, hey!

20:49.582 --> 20:50.750
Sit down, Neil.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.251
You can stop me,

20:52.543 --> 20:54.623
but you can't stop the people
from stopping the show.

20:54.795 --> 20:55.795
Shh.

20:57.757 --> 20:58.758
You hear that?

21:03.679 --> 21:04.847
Oh, my God.

21:05.139 --> 21:06.766
It's the people
coming to stop the show.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.851
Oh, now what do we do?

21:09.143 --> 21:12.271
We have to stop the people. Their
freedom of speech depends on it.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.064
Frankie, Chang, bar the doors.

21:14.356 --> 21:15.816
Annie, introduce him quick.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.535
I don't want to do this.

21:26.827 --> 21:28.370
Listen, you piece of crap.

21:28.662 --> 21:30.080
We've been to hell
and back for you,

21:30.372 --> 21:32.666
so get up there and do your
stupid act for freedom.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.627
Okay, okay.

21:34.919 --> 21:35.961
Ladies and gentlemen,

21:36.253 --> 21:39.048
he's performed at colleges
and clubs all over.

21:39.340 --> 21:40.925
Gupta Gupti Gupta!

21:44.094 --> 21:46.055
Hey, y'all.

21:46.347 --> 21:49.141
Look, I see there's a lot
of Jews in the crowd.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.060
I mean, you know, there isn't,

21:51.352 --> 21:55.231
but usually when I do my act
there's more, but you know,

21:55.523 --> 21:58.192
I have a whole Jew thing.
I... Do it.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.402
Okay, okay. Who's this guy?

22:00.694 --> 22:01.695
Stop performing.

22:01.987 --> 22:04.323
Do not stop performing.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.492
Okay, this guy. Look at him.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.245
It looks like he ate so much.
He's very fat.

22:09.537 --> 22:11.539
Don't do this to me.
Shut up and listen.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.873
I see that you're fat,

22:13.165 --> 22:14.917
but are you also
black or Jewish?

22:15.209 --> 22:18.629
You know, it's hard to be fat
when you're black or Jewish

22:18.921 --> 22:21.924
because when you're black your
community steals all your food,

22:22.216 --> 22:24.093
so you can't eat as much,

22:24.385 --> 22:27.596
and when you're Jewish,
nobody ever buys anything,

22:27.888 --> 22:29.890
so you can't eat as much.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.269
You're damned if you do.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.437
You're damned if you don't.

22:35.729 --> 22:37.398
Ugh.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.442
Oh, dear God.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.278
The bastards did it.

22:42.570 --> 22:44.530
They leaked
the entire school's data.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.210
Okay, so hey,
fat guy in the audience.

22:58.502 --> 23:00.796
Have you found anyone else
you could love,

23:01.088 --> 23:02.923
like another fat person,

23:03.215 --> 23:06.552
or are you one of those fat
people who will always be alone?

23:16.020 --> 23:17.646
Hey, Leonard!

23:17.938 --> 23:19.899
You enjoy my girlfriend in 2009?

23:20.190 --> 23:23.652
As much as she enjoyed
your plagiarized poetry.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.571
I will kill you!

23:25.863 --> 23:27.489
Don't act
like you care about me!

23:27.781 --> 23:30.242
I've seen all your cartoons
about me!

23:30.534 --> 23:32.578
I am this school's
worst nightmare!

23:32.870 --> 23:36.582
I am a Garrett
with no soul left to steal!

23:39.919 --> 23:42.379
Man, it's like Road Warrior
out there,

23:42.671 --> 23:43.797
but if petrol were privacy

23:44.089 --> 23:46.258
and bad teeth
were dirty secrets.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.177
Good news.
Neil's talking to us again.

23:48.469 --> 23:50.869
He says he respects our moral
position but not our execution.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.365
Also he says he's never
talking to us again.

23:52.389 --> 23:54.642
I don't see how we
can bounce back from this one.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.018
- This one?
- Yeah.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.913
If you follow a theme
of revealed secrets,

23:57.937 --> 23:59.372
the email hack
is the third installment

23:59.396 --> 24:00.957
of a trilogy that began
with Annie losing a pen

24:00.981 --> 24:02.581
in what I've come
to call the golden age.

24:02.733 --> 24:04.293
I'm guessing
the second chapter would be

24:04.318 --> 24:06.379
when your best friend vanished
on a mysterious boat trip

24:06.403 --> 24:08.323
after the older one
masturbated himself to death?

24:10.115 --> 24:12.618
If that's one you guys bounced
back from, we might be okay.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.370
What's the lesson here?

24:14.662 --> 24:17.081
I always want to make sure
I know what the lesson is.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.540
I'm a completist.

24:18.832 --> 24:20.272
The rest of the school's
in shambles,

24:20.376 --> 24:23.170
so maybe we're more evolved
and forgiving than them?

24:23.462 --> 24:25.047
We already know that, stupid.

24:25.339 --> 24:28.008
I feel more desensitized to
jokes about Jews and blacks.

24:28.300 --> 24:29.385
Is that good? Say what?

24:29.677 --> 24:30.761
Eh.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.614
We know the pieces are
privacy, freedom of speech,

24:32.638 --> 24:33.678
terrorism, and government,

24:33.722 --> 24:35.402
so the lesson is probably
an ironic pairing

24:35.516 --> 24:36.952
like one man's privacy
is another man's freedom.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.143
Government is terrorism?

24:38.435 --> 24:40.729
The only free speech
is private speech.

24:41.021 --> 24:44.149
A free government
terrorizes privacy.

24:44.441 --> 24:45.901
That's all four, bitches.

24:46.193 --> 24:49.363
Terror is terrorized by...

24:49.655 --> 24:50.823
Terry the Terrorist?

24:51.115 --> 24:55.536
Tarry not,
for terrorism terrifies.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.428
Govern the government.
Freedom of speech.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.796
We caught the hacker.

25:06.088 --> 25:08.674
This is Ryan aka
"String Cheese Hustler"

25:08.966 --> 25:11.927
aka "Fart Mitzvah,"
"SkullandBoners88,".

25:12.219 --> 25:14.013
"Frozen Sucked,"
"Captain Titty."

25:14.304 --> 25:16.015
You don't need
to know all his names.

25:16.306 --> 25:17.826
He lives across the street
from the campus,

25:17.850 --> 25:20.060
and he's got something
he wants to say.

25:20.811 --> 25:21.812
Don't you?

25:22.104 --> 25:23.689
I'm sorry. For what?

25:23.981 --> 25:26.942
For guessing your school master
password was "change me."

25:27.234 --> 25:29.153
Oops.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.447
How do you sleep at night,
Warburton?

25:31.739 --> 25:34.324
You were one of us.
You were free.

25:34.616 --> 25:36.452
No one's free
when they're one of anything,

25:36.744 --> 25:37.870
and to answer your question,

25:38.162 --> 25:40.664
I sleep alone with one eye open.

25:40.956 --> 25:42.750
That's why I'm not
the one in cuffs.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.545
Let's go, Fart Mitzvah.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.883
Crime doesn't pay.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.594
Crime doesn't pay!

26:07.733 --> 26:09.359
I'm sorry if I used photography

26:09.651 --> 26:12.029
to digitally approximate
some of your naked bodies.

26:12.321 --> 26:13.489
It's all right.

26:13.781 --> 26:15.115
It is? No!

26:22.831 --> 26:24.124
Anything?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.418
Same as yesterday.

26:26.710 --> 26:29.505
Big cloud of data
raining over a pasture.

26:29.797 --> 26:32.049
All 8 billion sheep
keep grazing.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.093
Is that good?

26:35.719 --> 26:37.554
Sure.

26:37.846 --> 26:39.098
That thing you said back there

26:39.389 --> 26:41.266
about not being a part
of anything.

26:41.558 --> 26:43.477
Is that really how you feel?

26:43.769 --> 26:45.437
It's not a question
of how I feel.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.231
I feel like flying,

26:47.523 --> 26:49.024
I don't jump off buildings.

26:51.568 --> 26:54.029
Do you believe in God,
Warburton?

26:54.321 --> 26:56.881
You know, there's no rule that
says we have to be friends, right?

26:57.116 --> 26:59.276
How about common courtesy?
You familiar with that rule?

26:59.368 --> 27:02.329
Well, it's common courtesy
of opposite values.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.540
Common courtesy's
just gibberish.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.250
Hocus pocus.

27:06.542 --> 27:09.795
A spell we cast
when hoping to cheat reality.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.380
You're a cynical son of a bitch.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.549
I'll give you that.

27:13.841 --> 27:15.610
You know, my wife, she makes
these dreamcatchers...

27:15.634 --> 27:18.470
Shh. Shut the hell up.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.490
How fast can you get us
to the mainframe hardline?

27:20.514 --> 27:22.307
Yankee doodle dandy.
