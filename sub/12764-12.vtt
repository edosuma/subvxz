00:01.006 --> 00:02.680
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:03.235 --> 00:05.672
<i>When I knew that I would not
always be here to guide you,</i>

00:09.388 --> 00:11.289
<i>assure you that
you would never be alone.</i>

00:11.417 --> 00:13.458
I wanna understand
why you think the way you do.

00:13.578 --> 00:16.372
You don't wanna get inside my head.
It's a scary place.

00:16.568 --> 00:17.999
I want you to read Andy's mind.

00:18.632 --> 00:19.997
I think I like her.

00:20.206 --> 00:23.297
You make fun of me, you put me down,
you always have to have the last word.

00:23.880 --> 00:25.046
I thought that was...

00:25.191 --> 00:26.216
our thing.

00:26.629 --> 00:27.777
We have a thing?

00:28.128 --> 00:30.096
I got a letter from
this conservatory in New York.

00:30.455 --> 00:31.572
And I kinda got in.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.310
- Admit it, now you're having doubts.
- I do have doubts.

00:34.430 --> 00:36.861
- There's something I need to tell you...
- No!

00:37.025 --> 00:38.708
I've doubts about
everything in my life...

00:38.901 --> 00:40.317
except how I feel about you.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.361
<i>Madacorp sent some wicked-hot mentally</i>

00:42.483 --> 00:44.826
scrambled science experiment
to invade your life.

00:45.794 --> 00:46.810
Why?

00:46.967 --> 00:48.062
I don't know.

00:48.821 --> 00:50.111
<i>It's like they've been watching.</i>

00:50.234 --> 00:51.674
Get her into their family's life.

00:52.817 --> 00:56.670
<i>Destabilizing the boy's support
structure will make him more vulnerable.</i>

00:56.790 --> 00:58.505
Her nutcase sister is
the one who hit me.

00:59.045 --> 01:00.632
There must be a logical explanation.

01:00.752 --> 01:02.269
Whatever she did to Lori,

01:02.401 --> 01:04.381
I don't think Jessi's
gonna flip out on Kyle.

01:04.649 --> 01:06.049
I think I just read your mind.

01:06.616 --> 01:07.745
My sister...

01:09.468 --> 01:10.471
she shot me.

01:10.591 --> 01:12.187
I think you should know something.

01:12.307 --> 01:14.925
- What do you want?
- I wanna know who I really am.

01:15.131 --> 01:16.234
Kyle, they said you...

01:18.564 --> 01:19.613
Just believe in me.

01:20.191 --> 01:21.615
That's what Charlie always said.

01:24.682 --> 01:27.297
I can't stress it strongly enough,
Captain.

01:27.476 --> 01:30.036
Jessi should be treated
as a psychiatric case...

01:30.473 --> 01:31.602
not a criminal one.

01:34.559 --> 01:35.613
Thank you.

01:39.994 --> 01:41.480
I'm worried about Lori.

01:42.208 --> 01:43.413
She's angry at...

01:46.121 --> 01:47.174
Are you okay?

01:48.934 --> 01:51.800
Times like this, when the professional
line blurs with the personal,

01:51.920 --> 01:53.678
- it's...
- Difficult.

01:54.334 --> 01:56.056
The hardest part is the guilt.

01:57.196 --> 01:58.032
Guilt?

01:58.171 --> 02:00.061
I'm the one who brought Jessi
into this house.

02:01.849 --> 02:02.896
No.

02:03.848 --> 02:05.013
You tried to help her.

02:06.344 --> 02:07.360
Tried.

02:13.163 --> 02:14.405
What's the matter?

02:18.527 --> 02:19.675
My head is...

02:27.090 --> 02:28.093
I'm fine.

02:29.026 --> 02:30.429
You need to get some rest.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.327
You're exhausted.

02:33.732 --> 02:35.018
We all are.

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:44.663 --> 02:45.678
Why?

02:46.327 --> 02:48.152
I'm too riled up to sleep.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.960
Therefore I don't get to sleep either?

02:51.419 --> 02:54.391
I spent all night scheming
revenge against Jessi.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.708
- And what did you come up with?
- Nothing good.

02:58.541 --> 03:00.812
I need a diabolical mind in my corner.

03:02.454 --> 03:04.346
And I'm said diabolical mind?

03:04.555 --> 03:05.558
Exactly.

03:05.752 --> 03:07.106
Good morning, guys.

03:08.374 --> 03:09.899
Dad, do me a solid.

03:10.413 --> 03:13.062
Go downstairs and throw
some black into that pot.

03:13.614 --> 03:15.976
Not quite sure what that meant,
but we'll go with no.

03:17.458 --> 03:18.680
How you doing, Lori?

03:18.991 --> 03:20.032
What do you think?

03:22.647 --> 03:24.313
I'm gonna go.

03:29.881 --> 03:31.884
Now, I know you've been
through a lot lately,

03:32.076 --> 03:33.462
but your tone needs adjusting.

03:34.092 --> 03:37.382
Oh, so we're going with stern,
responsible dad now? That's rich.

03:37.617 --> 03:40.141
I have dealt with your attitude
because I know you're angry.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.801
I know you're confused,
you need to lash out against someone.

03:43.382 --> 03:45.642
But don't you dare treat me
like I'm some peer

03:45.900 --> 03:48.258
you can cut down with some snide
little comments.

03:48.385 --> 03:50.732
I am your father. This stops now.

04:10.892 --> 04:12.054
What are you doing?

04:12.337 --> 04:13.503
Same thing as you.

04:14.773 --> 04:15.808
Which is?

04:16.916 --> 04:17.920
Pacing.

04:18.297 --> 04:21.022
Continuous back-and-forth walking
in an effort to clear one's mind

04:21.142 --> 04:22.586
for mental breakthrough.

04:22.755 --> 04:23.865
I got that part.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.481
Why are you pacing?

04:27.489 --> 04:28.503
Why are you?

04:29.027 --> 04:31.691
There's some seriously toxic mojo
going down in this house, and I'm

04:31.811 --> 04:33.269
looking for a solution.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.091
Me, too.

04:36.616 --> 04:38.704
Well, good. 'Cause I could use some

04:38.829 --> 04:42.512
super brain enhancement to help Lori
figure out how to get revenge on Jessi.

04:44.605 --> 04:45.669
Jessi?

04:46.311 --> 04:47.573
Yeah. You know?

04:47.848 --> 04:49.882
Brown hair, green eyes, 5 foot...

04:50.465 --> 04:51.725
11 personalities.

04:52.260 --> 04:54.311
I don't think
you should get involved in that.

04:54.978 --> 04:56.332
Not get involved?

04:56.571 --> 04:57.670
Are you crazy?

04:57.969 --> 04:59.448
She deserves whatever we dish out.

04:59.570 --> 05:01.462
There's a lot about her
that you don't know.

05:01.598 --> 05:03.205
Dude, are you defending her?

05:03.370 --> 05:04.837
- No, I...
- Whatever, man.

05:05.191 --> 05:07.920
I thought Lori could rely
on her brothers to have her back.

05:23.419 --> 05:25.526
My life was spinning out of control.

05:25.863 --> 05:28.327
The Fallout of my secrets had brought
trouble into the lives

05:28.447 --> 05:29.769
of the people I loved.

05:30.179 --> 05:32.153
And I was powerless to stop it.

05:46.240 --> 05:49.717
Hils, I'm talking hostile takeover
of Jessi's reputation.

05:50.408 --> 05:53.776
Declan, things are falling apart and
I need help figuring out what to do.

05:54.197 --> 05:55.209
I'm coming over.

05:55.329 --> 05:57.933
Fire up that G-Force.
I need your mind working at it's best.

05:58.550 --> 05:59.584
Hold on.

06:00.156 --> 06:01.319
Where's everyone going?

06:01.694 --> 06:03.704
- I gotta go see Hillary.
- I gotta go see Andy.

06:03.836 --> 06:05.154
And I'm meeting Declan.

06:05.334 --> 06:06.951
I don't think anyone should leave.

06:07.099 --> 06:10.297
Jessi's still unaccounted for, and
we don't know what her state of mind is.

06:10.466 --> 06:12.773
Sure we do. Six ticks past psychotic.

06:14.027 --> 06:15.036
Too much?

06:15.376 --> 06:18.011
So... what, you're putting us
on lockdown?

06:19.589 --> 06:21.253
Until further notice...

06:23.044 --> 06:24.044
yes.

06:34.025 --> 06:35.039
He survived.

06:35.756 --> 06:36.764
Barely.

06:37.463 --> 06:40.566
His brain function is still intact.
No residual damage.

06:41.412 --> 06:44.617
I'd say the chair's retrieval system
performed better than expected,

06:44.737 --> 06:46.013
and I expected a lot.

06:46.208 --> 06:48.273
You can't put Kyle in that chair.

06:48.815 --> 06:50.271
Actually, I can.

06:50.562 --> 06:54.738
At best you'll get 10 percent
of his data before you fry his brain.

06:55.205 --> 06:56.908
I'd settle for one percent.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.497
You called?

07:00.975 --> 07:02.594
Where's the girl, Hollander?

07:05.004 --> 07:06.013
In the field.

07:06.176 --> 07:08.380
In other words,
your mission remains incomplete.

07:11.150 --> 07:13.049
I'll give the girl one more day.

07:14.940 --> 07:16.633
But if I don't get what I want,

07:16.906 --> 07:19.435
I'm strapping the boy into the chair.

07:28.502 --> 07:31.034
Okay...
I've called in the Andy reinforcements.

07:31.199 --> 07:33.218
Two diabolical minds at your disposal.

07:33.404 --> 07:35.494
- Forget it.
- Forget it?

07:36.033 --> 07:38.085
Has your thirst for revenge
been quenched already?

07:38.231 --> 07:39.231
Never.

07:40.021 --> 07:41.921
But I don't need to drag
you down with me.

07:42.130 --> 07:43.839
I'm supposed to be your bad-ass brother,

07:43.959 --> 07:46.084
ready to serve a beat down on command.

07:46.528 --> 07:47.817
Go have fun with Andy.

07:47.939 --> 07:51.443
You guys have better things to do
than get... caught up in all my drama.

07:52.327 --> 07:54.886
Okay, but we'll just be
a room away from turning

07:55.020 --> 07:57.812
our G-Force skills
into real-life mortal pain.

07:58.358 --> 08:00.670
Yeah, that's sort of exactly why
I'm keeping you out of it.

08:02.157 --> 08:03.549
Probably for the best.

08:12.543 --> 08:13.547
Hillary.

08:15.460 --> 08:17.191
Operation Vengeance in effect.

08:17.492 --> 08:19.313
- I brought cookies.
- Thank God.

08:19.615 --> 08:21.496
- Amanda.
- Is Kyle home?

08:28.079 --> 08:30.065
I'm sorry I compared you to Charlie.

08:30.402 --> 08:32.357
You don't need to be sorry for anything.

08:33.118 --> 08:34.813
I'm the one who should apologize.

08:36.519 --> 08:39.111
- It's just what I saw...
- Was confusing.

08:39.679 --> 08:40.683
I know.

08:41.134 --> 08:43.554
But I promise nothing
physical was going on.

08:44.307 --> 08:45.610
I wouldn't lie to you.

08:46.189 --> 08:47.363
I know you wouldn't.

08:48.392 --> 08:50.958
And I do believe in you,
even if it doesn't seem like I should.

08:52.683 --> 08:53.697
Thank you.

08:55.712 --> 08:58.300
Maybe if you told me
why you were so drawn to her.

09:02.308 --> 09:03.322
She's lost.

09:04.260 --> 09:05.267
Troubled.

09:07.511 --> 09:08.673
And you wanna help her?

09:13.869 --> 09:16.113
This is what I get
for dating a do-gooder.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.157
You're still mad.

09:19.782 --> 09:22.228
This isn't what I came
over here to talk about.

09:22.694 --> 09:24.622
What did you come over here
to talk about?

09:26.334 --> 09:27.335
I'm leaving.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.547
- You just got here.
- No, I mean I'm leaving town.

09:32.201 --> 09:33.206
Leaving town?

09:34.263 --> 09:35.140
For how long?

09:35.895 --> 09:37.471
For the rest of the semester.

09:38.065 --> 09:40.183
I got accepted to
a music program in New York.

09:42.631 --> 09:44.103
I leave in two days.

09:46.269 --> 09:47.269
Two days?

09:48.562 --> 09:50.573
Usually, the whole
multiple-question thing is cute,

09:50.695 --> 09:52.133
but I'm really struggling here.

09:52.602 --> 09:53.684
Why are you strug...

09:57.008 --> 09:59.669
You're struggling because
you're not sure if you wanna go.

10:00.176 --> 10:01.540
It's a dream come true, but...

10:01.660 --> 10:04.405
You're afraid you're using it
as an excuse to run away...

10:04.948 --> 10:06.641
because you have doubts about us.

10:08.498 --> 10:10.469
What do you think I should do?

10:20.822 --> 10:22.941
I think it's your decision to make.

10:25.926 --> 10:27.154
I'm just so confused.

10:30.390 --> 10:31.868
I need to clear my head.

10:33.453 --> 10:35.914
Don't bother with pacing.
It hasn't been working for me.

10:38.408 --> 10:39.877
I'm gonna go play for a while.

10:42.737 --> 10:44.424
See if I can figure it out.

10:54.726 --> 10:56.075
Whatever you decide...

10:57.569 --> 10:58.899
I'll be here for you.

11:00.641 --> 11:01.528
Promise?

11:02.977 --> 11:03.947
Promise.

11:05.016 --> 11:06.325
Then I know it'll happen.

11:18.570 --> 11:20.156
<i>- Hello?
- Kyle...</i>

11:21.914 --> 11:23.052
Emily.

11:23.969 --> 11:25.036
Yes.

11:25.887 --> 11:27.227
<i>What do you want?</i>

11:29.060 --> 11:30.478
Jessi needs your help.

11:30.979 --> 11:33.755
<i>She knows the truth about who
she really is, and she's run away.</i>

11:33.902 --> 11:35.151
She's in danger, isn't she?

11:36.252 --> 11:37.333
Yes.

11:37.936 --> 11:40.031
You're the only one who can
bring her home safely.

11:41.393 --> 11:43.221
I can tell when people are lying.

11:43.341 --> 11:45.579
<i>- I'm not lying.
- Or telling the whole truth.</i>

11:46.848 --> 11:48.268
You want the truth?

11:48.488 --> 11:50.793
If you don't find Jessi,
they'll hurt my family.

11:51.136 --> 11:53.255
<i>- Who are they?
- You're in danger too,</i>

11:53.375 --> 11:55.901
Kyle. You and everyone
who matters to you.

12:05.878 --> 12:07.379
I'm gonna ruin her reputation.

12:07.993 --> 12:10.758
You do it right, she'll be wearing
a Sacred Heart skirt by Friday.

12:11.641 --> 12:12.995
How you doing, Lori?

12:15.139 --> 12:17.735
I vow to kill the next person
that asks me that.

12:18.554 --> 12:19.754
What are you doing here?

12:20.264 --> 12:22.089
I... came to talk to Kyle.

12:22.268 --> 12:24.653
Oh, good. Maybe you can talk
some sense into him.

12:24.778 --> 12:26.889
His whole "believe the best
in people" philosophy

12:27.009 --> 12:30.847
has gotten way too close to Jessi
"spawn of the devil" Hollander.

12:31.332 --> 12:34.077
Clearly you're not willing to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

12:34.664 --> 12:36.614
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

12:36.744 --> 12:38.644
I just meant that it's complicated.

12:38.778 --> 12:40.251
Oh, my God.

12:40.407 --> 12:43.588
This thing's messy enough already
without you two going haywire.

12:44.313 --> 12:46.475
- She beat me up!
- I know that!

12:46.628 --> 12:48.802
Then you understand
she deserves whatever she gets.

12:51.304 --> 12:53.002
What is happening up there?

12:53.122 --> 12:54.267
Lori's outta control.

12:54.426 --> 12:55.560
She's just upset.

12:55.680 --> 12:57.896
She's more than upset.
She's acting like a 12-year-old.

12:58.744 --> 13:00.190
What's going on between you two?

13:01.421 --> 13:03.531
She thinks I'm having
an affair with Emily.

13:06.751 --> 13:08.701
I think I was hoping
for a little more outrage.

13:10.277 --> 13:12.121
It's not an outrageous assumption.

13:12.353 --> 13:14.182
- It damn well is.
- Stephen.

13:14.318 --> 13:16.442
I can't believe you would
even think for one minute...

13:16.562 --> 13:19.339
No, I don't think that.
I just meant that Lori...

13:19.668 --> 13:21.872
You're the psychologist.
Isn't the first reaction

13:21.992 --> 13:23.801
- usually the most telling?
- Let me finish.

13:24.338 --> 13:26.608
<i>- Please.
- I just meant that Lori has picked up</i>

13:26.728 --> 13:28.334
<i>on the dynamic you have with Emily.</i>

13:28.454 --> 13:29.601
<i>She's my co-worker.</i>

13:30.094 --> 13:32.631
<i>It's a little more than that.
Even I noticed it.</i>

13:33.739 --> 13:35.018
<i>Real mature, Trager.</i>

13:35.894 --> 13:38.653
<i>- Stephen, I'm trying to make a point.
- Which is?</i>

13:46.365 --> 13:48.259
<i>There was no way I could help.</i>

13:48.566 --> 13:49.979
<i>Nothing I could do.</i>

13:50.609 --> 13:52.242
<i>More than anything, I wanted it to end.</i>

13:52.362 --> 13:54.015
<i>a total disconnect between you and me.</i>

13:54.136 --> 13:55.605
<i>And then suddenly it did.</i>

14:10.642 --> 14:11.692
Adam?

14:15.610 --> 14:16.655
Is that really you?

14:18.193 --> 14:20.618
No. It's really you.

14:22.145 --> 14:23.530
I don't understand.

14:23.959 --> 14:26.081
You don't need to understand what I am.

14:26.772 --> 14:28.377
Only that I can help you.

14:31.099 --> 14:32.453
Thank God you're here.

14:32.574 --> 14:34.716
You do realize that I went
out of my way to pimp out

14:34.837 --> 14:37.202
my mom's media room
for our G-Force marathon.

14:37.336 --> 14:39.136
I'm hoping this will make up for it.

14:39.586 --> 14:40.726
Check it out.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.474
What do you think?

14:42.910 --> 14:44.001
It's perfect.

14:47.223 --> 14:48.822
<i>Cover fire on the left flank!</i>

14:48.989 --> 14:51.076
Especially for our last day together.

14:57.785 --> 14:59.046
Hey, Kyle, I made it.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.147
Okay.

15:02.717 --> 15:04.366
Guess I'll talk to you later.

15:07.626 --> 15:08.716
Kyle...

15:09.830 --> 15:11.625
you're upset because you think
all the anger

15:11.747 --> 15:14.220
that's dividing this house
is because of you.

15:14.670 --> 15:18.239
Madacorp obviously sent Jessi and Emily
into our lives to mess with me.

15:18.482 --> 15:20.021
I just can't figure out why.

15:20.468 --> 15:21.231
Well...

15:22.059 --> 15:23.263
what do they want?

15:24.238 --> 15:27.706
It has to be the information I took
from Zzyzx that's inside my head.

15:28.004 --> 15:29.403
How far will they go to get it?

15:29.537 --> 15:31.344
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

15:31.727 --> 15:33.571
- Just tell me.
- I can't.

15:35.218 --> 15:37.041
You need to slow down, Kyle...

15:37.723 --> 15:38.740
and think.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.460
I was able to get inside Jessi's head,

15:43.623 --> 15:44.790
read her thoughts.

15:45.535 --> 15:47.887
Madacorp must believe that
she can get into mine.

15:48.288 --> 15:49.503
But she hasn't.

15:49.829 --> 15:51.058
Not yet.

15:52.084 --> 15:53.099
Why?

15:55.112 --> 15:57.897
I had to get her to trust me,
let her guard down before

15:58.036 --> 15:59.677
I was able to dig deep enough.

16:00.533 --> 16:02.696
So then she's trying
to get you to trust her.

16:03.551 --> 16:05.728
But all she and Emily have done
is cause chaos.

16:05.863 --> 16:08.000
And how does that chaos make you feel?

16:09.398 --> 16:10.413
Upset.

16:10.978 --> 16:12.999
- Uncertain.
- Vulnerable?

16:14.915 --> 16:18.057
It makes me feel like everything that's
important to me is gonna disappear.

16:19.099 --> 16:20.259
When you're vulnerable,

16:20.763 --> 16:22.344
you let your guard down.

16:23.582 --> 16:24.680
Jessi.

16:26.141 --> 16:27.180
No...

16:27.604 --> 16:29.060
but it could have been.

16:30.063 --> 16:31.494
I'm losing my mind.

16:32.351 --> 16:34.525
Actually, you're just
beginning to find it.

16:38.370 --> 16:40.270
Madacorp manipulated everything.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.786
And my whole family has suffered for it.

16:44.746 --> 16:46.831
So what does that say about Jessi?

16:48.349 --> 16:49.676
She can't be trusted.

16:50.943 --> 16:52.652
She's bad like everyone said.

16:55.821 --> 16:58.271
When Kyle wakes up,
will you tell him I was here?

16:58.403 --> 17:01.350
Right, because I'm so in the mood
to be your messenger service.

17:01.623 --> 17:02.623
Trager...

17:04.229 --> 17:07.804
For the love of Peter Petrelli,
will you two cut it out?

17:08.852 --> 17:10.221
I have been a guest

17:10.340 --> 17:12.473
at your pity party of two for months.

17:12.749 --> 17:15.560
Wah wah, bicker bicker, boring boring.

17:16.377 --> 17:18.377
Now, for the sake of my sanity,

17:18.689 --> 17:20.119
and your future children,

17:20.262 --> 17:22.105
we're putting an end to this right now.

17:22.814 --> 17:24.395
You two need a mediation.

17:24.986 --> 17:26.837
I'm gonna go fetch our own
resident Dr. Phil.

17:26.957 --> 17:29.450
Ah! I don't wanna hear it
from Kyle right now.

17:29.570 --> 17:30.724
And he's asleep.

17:31.506 --> 17:32.740
All righty, then.

17:32.864 --> 17:35.498
You'll have to temporarily
settle for second best.

17:36.236 --> 17:37.835
Dr. Hils at your service.

17:38.004 --> 17:39.933
Hils, I really don't think...

17:40.069 --> 17:41.070
Sit!

17:46.193 --> 17:47.572
Okay, I've had enough.

17:48.932 --> 17:50.001
Hey,

17:50.396 --> 17:51.853
I was about to beat you.

17:52.831 --> 17:54.281
I'd say you already did.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.475
No. See, your player's still alive.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.896
I'm talking about that
little bomb you dropped earlier.

18:01.016 --> 18:02.422
I think that was your bomb.

18:02.544 --> 18:05.980
And if you want some advice, I'd lay off
the junk food, let your stomach settle.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.788
Andy, quit messing around!

18:08.093 --> 18:09.174
I'm in trouble, huh?

18:09.313 --> 18:11.504
How could you say it's
gonna be our last day together?

18:13.699 --> 18:15.691
What, are you, like, dying tomorrow?

18:16.213 --> 18:18.884
How many cancer patients
do you know that die overnight?

18:19.133 --> 18:20.431
You're doing it again.

18:20.730 --> 18:21.972
All right, fine.

18:23.373 --> 18:25.505
It's our last day together because

18:25.625 --> 18:27.071
I start chemo tomorrow.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.271
What does chemo have to do with...

18:30.391 --> 18:32.028
It has to do with me puking,

18:32.464 --> 18:35.043
you sympathizing, me withdrawing,

18:35.664 --> 18:38.391
you resenting me,
me resenting your resentment,

18:38.524 --> 18:40.155
blah blah blah.

18:41.395 --> 18:42.918
Trust me, it's messy.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.088
That's why I think it should
be our last day together.

18:51.792 --> 18:54.030
So why don't we make it special, okay?

18:57.279 --> 18:58.991
To kick things off,

18:59.985 --> 19:02.220
I think we should
go upstairs and make out.

19:09.414 --> 19:11.144
Pacing's not working for you.

19:11.460 --> 19:12.721
How do you know that?

19:13.586 --> 19:14.650
You said it.

19:15.214 --> 19:16.391
But not to you.

19:17.275 --> 19:20.256
That's right. You said you were me,
which means I'm talking to myself.

19:22.124 --> 19:23.672
Your self-doubt was paralyzing you.

19:25.069 --> 19:26.717
You needed someone to talk to.

19:28.448 --> 19:30.839
Someone I trusted more
than my own instincts.

19:31.002 --> 19:32.112
Someone like you.

19:33.350 --> 19:34.829
Kinda cool, isn't it?

19:36.638 --> 19:37.897
Okay, then.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.067
I need help deciding
if I should go after Jessi.

19:41.616 --> 19:44.306
You just realized she's
Madacorp's secret weapon.

19:45.625 --> 19:47.933
Wouldn't you be playing
right into their plan?

19:48.494 --> 19:50.854
But I can't believe that
she's a willing weapon.

19:51.063 --> 19:52.831
Which means she's out there
lost and alone.

19:53.169 --> 19:55.876
Why are you worried about her
after everything she's done?

19:56.470 --> 19:58.279
Because if I don't believe in her,

19:58.719 --> 19:59.881
no one will.

20:01.108 --> 20:02.676
Maybe no one should.

20:14.518 --> 20:15.924
What are you doing?

20:20.416 --> 20:21.819
Now, you gotta be nice.

20:29.058 --> 20:30.083
<i>You wanna play?</i>

20:30.579 --> 20:31.685
Let's play.

20:36.557 --> 20:38.426
No. No. Please.

20:40.344 --> 20:41.472
No, let him go!

20:42.999 --> 20:44.800
Why aren't you letting him go?

20:46.883 --> 20:48.772
Don't! Don't kill him!

20:58.155 --> 20:59.451
Oh, God!

21:27.591 --> 21:29.425
- I have to go to work.
- What?

21:29.865 --> 21:32.029
I rushed out last night
when I got the call about Kyle.

21:32.164 --> 21:34.244
I didn't get a chance to
shut down all my systems.

21:34.364 --> 21:36.456
I don't think it sends
a good message to the kids

21:36.576 --> 21:38.311
about the lockdown
if you leave right now.

21:38.508 --> 21:41.572
I am not in the mood to be lectured
about what's appropriate.

21:41.692 --> 21:43.502
- I'm not.
- No, let me finish.

21:43.796 --> 21:46.632
I ver betrayed the vows
I made to you when we got married.

21:47.215 --> 21:48.633
I never cheated, I never lied,

21:48.753 --> 21:50.585
and I never kept any secrets.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.165
But I guess you'll either
believe that or you won't.

22:02.844 --> 22:05.507
So why do I get the happy
family and the great life?

22:05.770 --> 22:08.031
You mean why does she get
the short end of the stick?

22:08.883 --> 22:10.884
- It's just a...
- Expression.

22:11.383 --> 22:13.203
I know. You're me, remember?

22:15.993 --> 22:17.333
Maybe she was born bad.

22:18.145 --> 22:20.084
The same way that you were born good.

22:20.482 --> 22:21.609
But was I?

22:22.105 --> 22:25.364
Or would being taken in
by a loving family make me good?

22:25.807 --> 22:26.970
She didn't have that.

22:27.651 --> 22:30.547
There's no one that cares
enough about her to help her.

22:31.341 --> 22:33.185
You're a do-gooder like Amanda said.

22:34.083 --> 22:34.979
Help her.

22:37.673 --> 22:39.124
I can't leave this house.

22:40.120 --> 22:41.300
So don't help her.

22:42.001 --> 22:44.910
- Stop confusing me.
- You just need to trust yourself.

22:47.731 --> 22:49.372
That's what this is all about.

22:50.486 --> 22:52.109
Even if I wanted to help her,

22:52.859 --> 22:54.403
I have no idea where she is.

22:55.590 --> 22:56.893
You should ask her.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.315
Help me.

23:09.817 --> 23:10.941
Help me.

23:14.810 --> 23:16.285
You're not really here.

23:17.122 --> 23:18.364
That's true.

23:32.026 --> 23:33.589
You look so happy.

23:38.727 --> 23:40.713
If I had what you have,

23:42.356 --> 23:43.935
I wouldn't come after me either.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.764
You made a promise to be here for her.

23:58.588 --> 23:59.744
I know.

24:01.146 --> 24:02.790
Would you break it just to help me?

24:05.660 --> 24:08.803
I'd help you so that we could
take down Madacorp and save my family.

24:08.979 --> 24:10.541
Do you think that's possible?

24:10.664 --> 24:11.869
It has to be.

24:12.177 --> 24:13.886
I can't live like this anymore.

24:17.858 --> 24:19.560
Then you should come find me.

24:20.919 --> 24:22.125
But where are you?

24:22.248 --> 24:23.821
That's for you to figure out.

24:25.285 --> 24:26.686
You already said that,

24:27.118 --> 24:28.613
you and I were the same.

24:30.364 --> 24:31.544
In a way, yes.

24:33.033 --> 24:34.125
So...

24:35.394 --> 24:37.122
have you ever run away?

24:37.878 --> 24:38.924
Once.

24:40.166 --> 24:41.586
Where did you go?

24:44.888 --> 24:46.258
Back to the beginning.

24:48.208 --> 24:49.838
Then you know where to look.

24:51.074 --> 24:52.378
The question is...

24:53.779 --> 24:54.934
will you?

25:22.443 --> 25:23.561
Are you okay?

25:25.436 --> 25:26.931
Stay away from me.

25:27.635 --> 25:29.771
- I'm bad.
- Are you lost?

25:29.936 --> 25:31.530
Do you need some help?

25:32.310 --> 25:33.928
I don't deserve help.

25:35.526 --> 25:36.646
Sweetie,

25:37.888 --> 25:39.461
what happened to you?

25:41.699 --> 25:44.946
I said stay away from me!

25:57.567 --> 25:59.135
What are you doing here?

26:04.063 --> 26:05.392
I'm sorry about earlier.

26:05.888 --> 26:07.674
You know the situation's
obviously sensitive.

26:07.794 --> 26:10.022
It's okay. We're all
under a lot of pressure.

26:10.261 --> 26:13.401
Well, you being here is a good sign.
I take it Jessi made it home.

26:14.086 --> 26:15.171
Yes.

26:15.414 --> 26:17.012
We had a long talk.

26:17.209 --> 26:20.368
She's got a lot to work out,
and I'm gonna get her some more help.

26:20.592 --> 26:21.795
Oh, good.

26:22.596 --> 26:24.515
The police are still
gonna want to talk to her.

26:24.662 --> 26:25.695
Of course.

26:26.495 --> 26:28.293
So what brings you
up to the fifth floor?

26:29.311 --> 26:31.402
I was shutting down
my system from the trial run,

26:31.522 --> 26:33.800
and I noticed the diagnostic results
have all been erased.

26:35.731 --> 26:37.137
That doesn't sound right.

26:37.342 --> 26:40.392
The entire server's on lockdown.
I don't have any access to it.

26:40.663 --> 26:43.228
I'm worried that it's viral,
I'm gonna check out the mainframe.

26:43.955 --> 26:46.524
You can't go in there right now.
Ballantine's

26:46.644 --> 26:48.901
giving a tour to a potential investor.

26:50.019 --> 26:51.028
On Sunday?

26:52.086 --> 26:54.109
Yeah, the human trial was so successful

26:54.229 --> 26:55.951
that he wanted to show it off.

26:56.757 --> 26:58.295
What? That's just the thing.

26:58.418 --> 27:00.540
We don't know if it was
because we don't have

27:00.660 --> 27:02.467
any access to the system.

27:03.399 --> 27:05.504
Stephen, go home.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.029
Worry about it tomorrow.

27:10.288 --> 27:11.744
What's going on in there?

27:12.415 --> 27:14.514
Nothing, just a business show-and-tell.

27:18.158 --> 27:19.478
I'll see you tomorrow?

27:21.035 --> 27:22.056
Sure.

27:28.414 --> 27:29.733
You're acting weird.

27:30.369 --> 27:32.787
I'm on top of you making out.
What's weird about it?

27:32.907 --> 27:34.115
You're being hesitant.

27:34.235 --> 27:36.063
Guys aren't supposed to do hesitant.

27:36.186 --> 27:37.570
I'm not being hesitant.

27:46.147 --> 27:47.500
Totally hesitant.

27:47.992 --> 27:50.477
- Stop using that word.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

27:50.661 --> 27:53.772
Any other guy would have his hand
halfway to the promised land by now.

27:54.343 --> 27:56.016
I'm trying to be respectful.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.154
No,

27:57.274 --> 28:00.145
respect is the slow, steady inching,

28:00.271 --> 28:02.471
waiting for me to swat your hand away.

28:02.643 --> 28:05.004
Respect is at least trying to go there.

28:07.388 --> 28:08.491
Unless...

28:09.738 --> 28:10.747
Unless what?

28:12.037 --> 28:14.168
Unless you've never gone there before.

28:16.926 --> 28:19.341
- You've never touched a boob.
- I've touched a boob.

28:19.595 --> 28:21.343
A real one or one of those inflatable...

28:21.465 --> 28:23.001
I've touched a boob, okay?

28:23.148 --> 28:24.388
Just never...

28:24.508 --> 28:25.808
Never what?

28:27.994 --> 28:29.477
Never one that mattered.

28:30.823 --> 28:32.481
My boobs matter?

28:32.766 --> 28:34.332
Well, of course they matter.

28:34.549 --> 28:36.820
Why else would I put up
with this humiliation?

28:39.013 --> 28:40.587
Then let me help you out.

28:47.670 --> 28:48.750
There you go.

28:49.183 --> 28:50.419
They're all ready for ya.

28:51.593 --> 28:54.152
Go where only a few men
have gone before.

28:54.275 --> 28:55.758
You're not helping.

28:55.983 --> 28:57.813
I'm serious. I want you to.

28:58.836 --> 29:00.681
Besides, this is your
only chance, remember?

29:01.228 --> 29:02.057
See?

29:03.189 --> 29:04.726
That's the problem.

29:05.068 --> 29:06.253
You're ruining it.

29:06.817 --> 29:08.565
You said this would be our last day.

29:09.413 --> 29:11.819
Which means that'll be
the last time I can touch

29:11.939 --> 29:13.201
them... boobs.

29:13.704 --> 29:14.864
And that's not cool!

29:15.319 --> 29:17.071
Because I wanna touch them tomorrow

29:17.196 --> 29:19.901
and the next day and
all the days after that.

29:21.069 --> 29:24.542
So quit acting like today is it for us,
'cause I don't want it to be.

29:25.005 --> 29:26.444
It has to be.

29:28.399 --> 29:30.632
You're gonna have to find
someone else to feel you up...

29:32.012 --> 29:33.478
'cause I'm not having it.

29:41.706 --> 29:42.771
<i>What we have here</i>

29:42.891 --> 29:44.519
is a failure to communicate.

29:44.639 --> 29:47.678
Hils, I've spent a year trying
to get Declan to communicate.

29:47.798 --> 29:51.214
- I seriously doubt...
- You say that like it is all my fault.

29:51.460 --> 29:54.276
I don't know, Mr. Secretive and Moody.
What do you think?

29:54.436 --> 29:56.378
You haven't exactly made it easy lately.

29:56.575 --> 29:58.957
Good. So it's my fault
that you dumped me

29:59.330 --> 30:01.686
for no reason and then
took up with La Femme Nikita.

30:01.806 --> 30:03.659
This is good.
We're speaking from the heart.

30:03.782 --> 30:05.577
Declan, I need to talk
to you for a minute.

30:05.737 --> 30:07.312
- Gladly!
- Oh, no! No way!

30:07.432 --> 30:10.346
We were just making progress.
We're not making progress here.

30:10.471 --> 30:11.972
We're wasting each other's time.

30:12.092 --> 30:15.226
So you think trying to get to the bottom
of our problems is a waste of time?

30:15.537 --> 30:17.959
Come on, Lori! You think
this is just as stupid as I do!

30:18.144 --> 30:19.403
I just need a minute.

30:20.737 --> 30:23.290
What you need is to accept
your part of the responsibility

30:23.410 --> 30:25.780
for the tragic demise
of Beachwood's best couple.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.241
For cryin' out loud!

30:27.440 --> 30:30.452
Seriously! I'm all in favor
for a good romance.

30:30.821 --> 30:33.453
But the intensity of
the Kyle-Declan friendship...

30:33.664 --> 30:35.041
we'll call it Kyclan...

30:35.161 --> 30:36.960
clearly interfered
between the relationship

30:37.228 --> 30:38.504
of Lori and Declan.

30:39.171 --> 30:41.298
Kyle, what do you have
to say for yourself?

30:44.841 --> 30:45.845
I'm sorry.

30:46.574 --> 30:47.794
I'm not doing this.

30:48.111 --> 30:49.729
Lori, if you wanna talk to me,

30:49.849 --> 30:51.820
really talk, minus the circus,

30:51.940 --> 30:53.018
then I'm here.

30:53.141 --> 30:55.256
Until then, leave me out of it.

30:58.625 --> 30:59.820
<i>She's right.</i>

31:00.285 --> 31:04.409
You, Lori, everything that's happened
to this family is all because of me.

31:06.716 --> 31:08.455
I need to put a stop to it.

31:09.459 --> 31:10.910
How can I help?

31:15.276 --> 31:16.464
Loan me your car.

31:17.058 --> 31:19.162
I thought you couldn't leave the house.

31:22.285 --> 31:23.944
You're going after her.

31:26.179 --> 31:28.520
The thing I admire most
about you is your faith in people.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.568
But I worry this time...

31:32.232 --> 31:33.693
it's gonna be the end of you.

31:34.482 --> 31:36.572
Does this mean
you won't give me the keys?

31:43.950 --> 31:45.216
Thank you.

31:45.585 --> 31:46.962
Good luck.

31:47.798 --> 31:49.152
You're gonna need it.

32:01.925 --> 32:03.019
Hello.

32:03.167 --> 32:04.790
I don't know how you do it.

32:05.146 --> 32:06.272
Do what?

32:06.401 --> 32:07.557
Help people.

32:07.889 --> 32:10.797
I gave it my all...
with Angst and Angstier.

32:11.726 --> 32:13.675
I learned from Phil and Oprah,

32:13.795 --> 32:15.709
yet everything comes up Springer.

32:16.238 --> 32:18.640
I'm a fraud. A Faux pas.

32:20.271 --> 32:23.623
Well, helping people, get in touch
with what they're really feeling

32:23.746 --> 32:25.314
is a complicated process.

32:26.094 --> 32:27.889
I just hate all the drama.

32:28.824 --> 32:31.321
Lori's my best friend.
I just wanna help her.

32:32.156 --> 32:34.985
All we can ever really do
is encourage people to

32:35.317 --> 32:37.641
talk openly about their problems.

32:37.850 --> 32:39.399
They may not like it, but...

32:39.916 --> 32:41.292
it's imperative to put issues

32:41.724 --> 32:42.966
out on the table.

32:43.101 --> 32:44.688
That's what I've been saying.

32:44.823 --> 32:47.674
I mean, really, is honesty
that freaking difficult?

32:50.923 --> 32:52.443
It shouldn't be, should it?

32:53.641 --> 32:55.695
And people think I'm the dumb blonde.

32:56.679 --> 32:59.730
I have to say, Hillary, I don't think
there's anything dumb about you.

33:25.353 --> 33:26.866
<i>What happened to you?</i>

33:27.341 --> 33:28.526
The old Tom,

33:29.468 --> 33:31.541
<i>he would have fought it out
till the bitter end.</i>

33:32.796 --> 33:33.561
<i>Big,</i>

33:34.097 --> 33:36.064
strong, stoic

33:36.941 --> 33:37.941
Tom Foss.

33:39.828 --> 33:42.250
Survived a war, brought down Zzyzx,

33:42.385 --> 33:45.158
then a little trip down memory lane

33:45.742 --> 33:47.156
did him in.

33:49.321 --> 33:50.453
All I want,

33:51.264 --> 33:52.703
all Baylin wanted,

33:52.911 --> 33:54.903
was to see Kyle reach his potential.

33:55.289 --> 33:57.340
But now Ballantine's
gonna put him in the chair

33:57.460 --> 33:58.549
and go for broke.

33:59.023 --> 34:02.196
It's gonna make what happened to you
look like a day at the spa.

34:04.570 --> 34:06.085
You let them beat you, Tom.

34:06.869 --> 34:08.259
You let them break you.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.062
And now they're gonna break Kyle.

34:13.416 --> 34:15.485
You are the traitor!
I'll never help you!

34:17.732 --> 34:18.905
You'll never break me.

35:01.469 --> 35:02.995
What are you doing?

35:03.115 --> 35:05.631
I came in here to ask
your permission to tell Stephen

35:05.779 --> 35:08.343
about the secret we kept
from the family only to find you

35:08.463 --> 35:10.054
sneaking out of the house?

35:11.626 --> 35:13.077
I'm going to find Jessi.

35:14.079 --> 35:16.896
- I wanted to tell you, but...
- But you knew I wouldn't let you go.

35:18.235 --> 35:19.483
This is important.

35:20.536 --> 35:22.819
More important than our trust in you?

35:25.283 --> 35:27.016
I'm doing this for all of you.

35:28.135 --> 35:30.718
I can fix this.
I can fix everything that's broken.

35:32.513 --> 35:33.841
Why Jessi?

35:34.641 --> 35:37.206
Why you? How are you two connected?

35:38.059 --> 35:40.534
You already know the answer
to that question.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.760
She and I are the same.

35:43.680 --> 35:45.487
What is that supposed to mean?

35:45.622 --> 35:47.599
I don't even know who you are.

35:50.911 --> 35:54.391
You told me once that I never brought
anything by love into this house.

35:56.383 --> 35:58.096
But all I ever brought was pain.

35:59.901 --> 36:01.770
I need to make this right.

36:02.873 --> 36:03.874
Please.

36:04.944 --> 36:06.370
I have to go.

36:33.117 --> 36:35.219
<i>I had promised her I'd always be here,</i>

36:35.625 --> 36:37.490
<i>just like I promised
myself I'd never put</i>

36:37.610 --> 36:39.007
<i>my family at risk.</i>

36:41.441 --> 36:43.642
<i>I had broken both those promises.</i>

37:08.569 --> 37:09.860
I'm not hungry.

37:11.323 --> 37:13.229
Consider it a peace offering.

37:14.632 --> 37:16.786
Considering I made them
for you in the first place,

37:17.214 --> 37:18.898
your gesturing's a little hollow.

37:19.022 --> 37:20.511
Don't be so cranky.

37:21.150 --> 37:22.405
Right.

37:29.758 --> 37:31.075
What are you pausing it for?

37:31.223 --> 37:34.272
Go ahead. Put the final nail
in the coffin of this miserable day.

37:34.407 --> 37:38.084
There's no rush.
I can beat you tomorrow and the next day

37:38.342 --> 37:40.314
and all the days after that.

37:42.622 --> 37:43.443
Really?

37:44.319 --> 37:45.398
Really.

38:13.993 --> 38:16.280
No more wild revenge scenarios?

38:16.489 --> 38:17.719
Not today.

38:18.002 --> 38:19.391
It's too exhausting.

38:19.601 --> 38:20.986
Where's your partner in crime?

38:21.106 --> 38:23.653
She said something about
a lost marathon and bailed.

38:23.773 --> 38:25.455
Which just leaves us.

38:26.232 --> 38:27.244
Lucky us.

38:28.003 --> 38:30.223
Listen, Lori, I don't wanna be that guy,

38:30.857 --> 38:32.375
the guy who's all locked up.

38:32.713 --> 38:34.989
You were the one I could
always open up to.

38:35.505 --> 38:36.630
But you never did.

38:37.251 --> 38:38.382
I did.

38:39.157 --> 38:40.217
Sort of.

38:41.113 --> 38:42.512
As much as I could.

38:43.351 --> 38:46.225
Says the guy with more baggage
than an airport carousel.

38:47.594 --> 38:49.868
I suppose I could limit myself to

38:49.991 --> 38:52.399
carry-on if it meant
that we could be friends again.

38:54.148 --> 38:56.486
One of those big rolly ones you have to

38:56.606 --> 38:58.456
scrunch and shove in the overhead?

38:58.576 --> 39:00.992
You really want to run this
metaphor into the ground, don't you?

39:01.327 --> 39:02.994
It's what I do.

39:04.770 --> 39:06.332
I miss this.

39:07.733 --> 39:08.918
I miss you.

39:11.288 --> 39:12.480
I miss you, too.

39:13.894 --> 39:16.047
I won't be able to change overnight.

39:16.932 --> 39:18.641
But if you can bear with me,

39:19.243 --> 39:21.370
I can try to be a little more...

39:24.051 --> 39:25.395
Communicative?

39:27.236 --> 39:28.483
I suppose.

39:29.056 --> 39:30.735
Open and honest?

39:31.699 --> 39:33.739
About... certain things.

39:35.131 --> 39:36.408
Warm and sunshiny?

39:36.742 --> 39:38.453
You may wanna quit while you're ahead.

39:40.075 --> 39:41.993
Downgraded from darts.
Things are looking up.

39:42.116 --> 39:43.783
I guess they are.

40:47.841 --> 40:49.661
Why did you come after me?

40:51.179 --> 40:52.205
You need me to.

40:56.204 --> 40:57.461
I'll betray you.

40:58.958 --> 41:00.716
That's what they want me to do.

41:02.341 --> 41:04.303
You don't have to do
what they want you to.

41:05.538 --> 41:07.579
You can make your own choices.

41:08.857 --> 41:10.351
That's what Nicole said.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.076
Nicole's smart.

41:14.355 --> 41:15.806
She helped me.

41:17.331 --> 41:19.052
Now let me help you.

41:21.880 --> 41:23.284
They'll take me back.

41:23.959 --> 41:25.631
We're not going back.

41:26.639 --> 41:28.456
Not until this is all over.

41:31.718 --> 41:33.884
I want it to be over.

41:36.072 --> 41:36.966
So do I.

42:18.968 --> 42:20.635
There's something I want to tell you.

42:21.347 --> 42:22.645
I want to talk to you, too.

42:24.669 --> 42:25.982
I don't know where to begin.

42:26.102 --> 42:27.809
Why don't we begin with me because

42:27.944 --> 42:29.801
there's something I need to tell you.

42:30.262 --> 42:31.989
I accused you of keeping secrets.

42:32.109 --> 42:33.783
What I have to say goes far beyond that.
