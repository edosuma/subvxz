00:34.817 --> 00:36.384
GOOD MORNING.
HEY, DEAC.

00:36.451 --> 00:38.653
DIDN'T DOUG TELL YOU I HAVE
MY LAW FIRM PICNIC TODAY?

00:38.721 --> 00:39.821
ACTUALLY, ARTHUR
LEFT ME A MESSAGE

00:39.889 --> 00:41.156
SAYING COME OVER
RIGHT AWAY.

00:41.223 --> 00:42.824
IT'S "CODE BLUE."

00:42.892 --> 00:44.092
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS?

00:44.160 --> 00:46.061
YEAH, CODE BLUE. COULD BE
ANYTHING FROM CHEST PAINS

00:46.128 --> 00:47.996
TO "LOOK WHAT I MADE
OUT OF PAPER CLIPS."

00:48.064 --> 00:50.899
DAD, DEACON'S HERE!

00:50.966 --> 00:52.700
SEND HIM DOWN.

00:56.071 --> 00:58.974
ANY WAY HE CAN
COME UP HERE?

00:59.041 --> 01:00.775
I'VE NEVER BEEN
DOWN THERE.

01:00.843 --> 01:03.028
HEY, DAD, WHY DON'T YOU
COME UP HERE

01:03.095 --> 01:04.662
AND TALK TO HIM, OK?

01:04.730 --> 01:05.897
NO CAN DO.

01:05.965 --> 01:08.499
THIS MATTER IS
FAR TOO INTIMATE.

01:10.536 --> 01:13.471
IF HE'S WEARING A ROBE,
EYES UP, OK?

01:15.774 --> 01:16.975
ARE YOU REALLY GONNA
MAKE ME WEAR THIS SHIRT

01:17.043 --> 01:18.176
TO THIS STUPID PICNIC?

01:18.244 --> 01:19.811
YES. WOULD YOU
STOP COMPLAINING?

01:19.878 --> 01:21.813
YOU LOOK ADORABLE.

01:21.880 --> 01:24.349
I LOOK LIKE
FRUIT-STRIPED GUM.

01:28.154 --> 01:31.857
THE PEOPLE I WORK WITH
ARE GONNA BE THERE.

01:31.924 --> 01:33.492
YOU NEED TO LOOK NICE.

01:33.559 --> 01:35.694
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH
THE T-SHIRT I HAD ON?

01:35.761 --> 01:38.062
OK, NOT SURE MY BOSSES
NEED TO KNOW

01:38.130 --> 01:40.931
THAT YOU'RE AN OFFICIAL
BIKINI INSPECTOR.

01:44.903 --> 01:47.922
WELL, THIS SHIRT'S
GOT A RIP IN IT.

01:47.989 --> 01:49.991
I JUST BOUGHT THAT.
WHERE?

01:59.952 --> 02:01.786
RIGHT HERE.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.610
BE RIGHT
WITH YOU, SON.

02:09.678 --> 02:11.112
GRAB YOURSELF
A SEAT.

02:28.930 --> 02:32.083
SO, ARTHUR,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:32.151 --> 02:34.235
WELL, I WAS TRACING
MY ANCESTRY,

02:34.303 --> 02:37.005
AND I HAD THESE DOCUMENTS
SENT TO ME.

02:37.073 --> 02:39.841
TURNS OUT MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER
HAD A SMALL FARM,

02:39.909 --> 02:43.778
AND ON THAT FARM
HE HAD SOME...

02:43.846 --> 02:48.533
CHICKENS?
E- I-E-I-O?

02:48.601 --> 02:51.218
NO. HE HAD-

02:51.286 --> 02:53.621
LET'S JUST SAY HE HAD

02:53.689 --> 02:57.058
A LITTLE HELP
AROUND THE HOUSE.

02:57.126 --> 02:58.392
HE HAD A MAID?

02:58.460 --> 02:59.744
NO! HE HAD SLAVES,
DAMN IT!

02:59.812 --> 03:04.048
SLAVES, I TELL YA.
THE MAN HAD SLAVES.

03:04.116 --> 03:07.302
WOW. OK. WELL, UM...

03:07.370 --> 03:10.605
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE
HAD SLAVES BACK THEN.

03:10.672 --> 03:11.956
BUT THIS IS MY FAMILY,

03:12.024 --> 03:13.858
AND I NEED
TO SET THINGS STRAIGHT.

03:16.128 --> 03:18.363
UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:18.431 --> 03:21.082
I WANT TO WRITE YOU
A CHECK.

03:25.253 --> 03:27.455
FOR REPARATIONS.

03:27.523 --> 03:29.623
WHY WOULD YOU
WANT TO PAY ME?

03:29.691 --> 03:30.842
WELL, YOU'RE BLACK,

03:30.909 --> 03:32.344
AND THE ONLY OTHER
BLACK PEOPLE I KNOW

03:32.411 --> 03:35.413
ARE ON TV.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.048
TOSS A NUMBER AT ME.

03:37.116 --> 03:38.866
YOU DON'T NEED TO
PAY ME REPARATIONS.

03:38.934 --> 03:40.902
YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING WRONG.

03:40.969 --> 03:43.555
MY FAMILY COMMITTED
A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY,

03:43.622 --> 03:44.923
AND I'M GONNA
MAKE IT RIGHT!

03:44.990 --> 03:46.724
TOSS A NUMBER AT ME.

03:46.792 --> 03:48.376
OK, LOOK,
HOW ABOUT THIS.

03:48.444 --> 03:49.377
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST PAY ME

03:49.445 --> 03:51.111
WHAT YOU OWE ME
FROM POKER?

03:51.179 --> 03:52.981
THAT IS A SEPARATE ISSUE!

03:53.049 --> 03:54.899
ARTHUR,
IT'S VERY NICE

03:54.967 --> 03:56.534
THAT YOU'RE SO CONCERNED ABOUT SLAVERY,

03:56.602 --> 03:59.270
BUT AS YOU MAY
OR MAY NOT KNOW,

03:59.338 --> 04:01.439
I'M ALREADY FREE.

04:01.507 --> 04:04.909
SO WE'RE GOOD.

04:04.977 --> 04:06.311
I GOTTA GO.

04:06.378 --> 04:07.812
ARE YOU SURE?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.781
I WOULDN'T WANT THINGS
TO GET WEIRD BETWEEN US.

04:09.848 --> 04:11.783
THAT SHIP HAS SAILED.

04:24.763 --> 04:26.814
THAT'S 2 DEAD!

04:26.882 --> 04:28.449
2 DEAD!

04:28.517 --> 04:29.817
AND THAT'S
HOW I FOUND OUT

04:29.885 --> 04:31.719
I'M LACTOSE
INTOLERANT.

04:31.787 --> 04:35.322
THAT'S... WILD.

04:35.390 --> 04:36.924
ALL RIGHT,
THIS NEXT GUY'S A LEFTY!

04:36.992 --> 04:39.210
COVER THE LINE!
HE CAME YOUR WAY LAST TIME,

04:39.277 --> 04:42.012
MRS. RANDOLF!

04:42.080 --> 04:43.364
ON TOP OF THAT,

04:43.432 --> 04:45.800
NOW I'M ALLERGIC
TO WHEAT.

04:45.867 --> 04:47.101
OH.

04:47.168 --> 04:48.786
AND YOU KNOW
HOW MUCH I LOVE BREAD.

04:48.854 --> 04:51.773
YEP, THAT IS YOUR REP.

04:51.841 --> 04:54.342
OH, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
BACK OUT IN THE FIELD.

04:54.409 --> 04:55.576
WE'LL PICK THIS UP
NEXT INNING.

04:55.644 --> 04:57.645
ABSOLUTELY. OK.

04:57.713 --> 05:00.481
UNLESS I'M HIDING
IN THE PORTA-POTTY.

05:00.549 --> 05:02.016
DID YOU SEE
THAT CATCH?

05:02.083 --> 05:02.884
YES, I DID.

05:03.035 --> 05:05.636
YOU ARE RUNNING AROUND
LIKE A LUNATIC OUT THERE.

05:05.704 --> 05:07.255
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
I MADE MY ROUNDS,

05:07.323 --> 05:08.540
WE CAN GO.
WHAT?

05:08.607 --> 05:10.842
YOU DRAGGED ME HERE,
NOW I'M HAVING FUN.

05:10.909 --> 05:14.145
BESIDES, WE GOT A CHANCE
OF WINNING THIS THING.

05:14.213 --> 05:17.365
DOUG, NOBODY CARES
ABOUT THIS THING BUT YOU.

05:17.433 --> 05:18.483
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
THE SHORTSTOP

05:18.550 --> 05:21.118
HAS A FULL PLATE
OF CHICKEN.

05:21.186 --> 05:22.152
OK, SEE RIGHT THERE,
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

05:22.220 --> 05:23.688
BETWEEN YOU AND I.

05:23.756 --> 05:25.223
WHEN IT COMES
TO PICNIC SOFTBALL,

05:25.291 --> 05:27.292
YOU GOT NOTHING
IN HERE.

05:27.359 --> 05:28.893
EXCUSE ME.

05:31.413 --> 05:34.215
WHILE I'M UP, WOULD YOU
GET ME A PLATE OF CHICKEN?

05:58.140 --> 06:01.092
YEAH! WHOO-HOO!

06:01.159 --> 06:03.027
HA HA HA! YOU!

06:03.095 --> 06:05.112
OH, MY GOD!

06:10.919 --> 06:12.920
YEAH!

06:18.661 --> 06:20.962
HEY, BABE, YOU READY
TO HIT EL CHOLO'S?

06:21.030 --> 06:22.246
UH, YES, WE WILL EAT,

06:22.314 --> 06:24.715
JUST AS SOON AS YOU
APOLOGIZE TO MR. THOMPSON.

06:24.783 --> 06:28.553
YOU LURED ME DOWN
HERE WITH MEXICAN FOOD?

06:28.621 --> 06:32.173
YES. AND ONCE AGAIN,
IT WORKED.

06:32.241 --> 06:33.658
OK, HERE HE COMES.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.593
UH, MR. THOMPSON,
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

06:35.661 --> 06:38.145
DOUG, YOU REMEMBER
MR. THOMPSON

06:38.214 --> 06:39.146
AND MR. KAPLAN,

06:39.215 --> 06:40.348
ONE OF
THE SENIOR PARTNERS.

06:40.416 --> 06:41.782
OH.
HOW YOU DOING?

06:41.850 --> 06:44.919
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HOW'S IT GOING? OH.

06:44.986 --> 06:46.521
HEY.
HEY.

06:47.756 --> 06:49.540
YEAH, DOUG JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE

06:49.608 --> 06:51.075
FOR RUNNING INTO YOU
LIKE THAT AT THE GAME.

06:51.143 --> 06:52.110
RIGHT, HONEY?

06:52.178 --> 06:53.744
YEAH, I'M SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

06:53.813 --> 06:54.745
I GUESS YOU WON'T BE
BLOCKING THE PLATE

06:54.814 --> 06:56.981
NEXT TIME, THOUGH,
WILL YOU?

06:57.049 --> 06:59.633
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
IT'S HIS OWN FAULT.

06:59.701 --> 07:01.635
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU LET A CORPORATE LAWYER

07:01.703 --> 07:03.604
DO A LITIGATOR'S JOB.

07:08.143 --> 07:10.377
THAT IS FUNNY.

07:10.445 --> 07:12.597
ANYWAY, THIS IS GREAT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

07:12.665 --> 07:14.014
I LIKE THE WAY
YOU PLAY, DOUG.

07:14.083 --> 07:15.216
I LIKE YOUR HUSTLE.

07:15.284 --> 07:16.300
REALLY?

07:16.368 --> 07:18.469
CARRIE, COULD YOU
GRAB US SOME COFFEE?

07:18.537 --> 07:19.570
DOUG, YOU
WANT SOME COFFEE?

07:19.638 --> 07:21.038
SURE.

07:21.106 --> 07:22.406
HONEY, YOU KNOW
HOW I LIKE IT.

07:26.011 --> 07:28.312
SURE. BE RIGHT BACK,
SWEETIE.

07:28.380 --> 07:31.565
YOU KNOW,
OUR FIRM HAS A TEAM.

07:31.633 --> 07:33.201
WE PLAY IN
THE LAWYERS' LEAGUE

07:33.269 --> 07:34.468
SATURDAYS IN THE PARK,

07:34.536 --> 07:38.006
AND I AM SICK OF GETTING
OUR HEINIES KICKED.

07:38.073 --> 07:40.241
HOW'D YOU LIKE
TO COME PLAY FOR US?

07:40.309 --> 07:42.727
I'M NOT A LAWYER.

07:42.795 --> 07:44.044
WELL, NOBODY
HAS TO KNOW THAT.

07:44.112 --> 07:45.746
YEAH!

07:45.814 --> 07:47.465
YOU GET OUT THERE,
YOU FUDGE IT.

07:48.800 --> 07:50.968
YOU COULD DO THAT FOR US,
COULDN'T YOU, DOUG?

07:51.036 --> 07:53.738
WELL, I DO
LIKE FUDGE.

07:53.806 --> 07:57.909
EXCUSE ME, I REALLY DON'T
THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

07:57.976 --> 07:59.143
OH, I THINK
IT'S A GREAT IDEA.

07:59.211 --> 08:00.945
WHY AM I NOT
DRINKING COFFEE?

08:01.013 --> 08:02.613
RIGHT.

08:02.681 --> 08:03.748
SO HOW WOULD
THIS WORK, NOW?

08:03.815 --> 08:05.183
I JUST SHOW UP
AT THE BALL FIELD

08:05.251 --> 08:07.151
CARRYING
A BRIEFCASE?

08:07.219 --> 08:08.786
OH, YOU'RE MARVELOUS.

08:08.854 --> 08:11.256
NO. YOU JUST TELL THEM
YOU'RE NEW TO THE FIRM.

08:11.323 --> 08:12.623
WE'LL SET YOU UP
WITH A PHONE LINE HERE

08:12.691 --> 08:14.158
IN CASE ANYBODY CALLS.

08:14.226 --> 08:16.577
WE'LL HAVE CARRIE
ANSWER THE PHONE.

08:16.645 --> 08:18.445
WON'T THAT BE CUTE?

08:18.513 --> 08:21.232
IF I CAN JUST
OFFER A THOUGHT HERE-

08:21.299 --> 08:22.233
YOU KNOW
WHAT MY THOUGHT IS?

08:22.301 --> 08:24.335
BAGELS.

08:24.403 --> 08:27.004
ONION.

08:36.347 --> 08:38.049
HEY.
HEY, CARRIE.

08:38.116 --> 08:39.482
IS THAT DEACON?

08:41.269 --> 08:44.505
I NEED A ONE-ON-ONE
WITH YOU ASAP.

08:44.573 --> 08:46.891
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

08:46.959 --> 08:49.193
NOT HERE.

08:53.632 --> 08:55.733
SO, SLUGGER'S WIFE,

08:55.767 --> 08:57.434
YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO ME NOW

08:57.502 --> 08:59.137
OR LATER WITH INTEREST?

08:59.204 --> 09:01.472
AND BY INTEREST
I MEAN...

09:01.539 --> 09:05.209
WAH WAH WAH REOWRRR.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.114
STOMACH CRAMPS?

09:10.182 --> 09:11.932
NO. SEX.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.619
AND WHICH ONE OF US
IS MAKING THAT NOISE?

09:14.686 --> 09:16.988
ME, WHEN YOU
DO THE WAH...

09:17.055 --> 09:19.456
NEVER MIND.
ALL RIGHT, THE POINT IS

09:19.524 --> 09:20.674
YOU HAVE NOTHING TO
WORRY ABOUT, ALL RIGHT?

09:20.742 --> 09:21.742
YOUR BOSSES LOVE ME.

09:21.810 --> 09:23.378
I'M GONNA BE THEIR RINGER,
FOR GOD SAKES.

09:23.445 --> 09:24.879
YEAH, ABOUT THAT-

09:24.946 --> 09:26.714
WHAT?

09:26.781 --> 09:28.733
UM, LOOK, I THINK YOU'RE
A GREAT SOFTBALL PLAYER.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.167
OK, NO DOUBT
ABOUT THAT.

09:30.235 --> 09:32.269
IT'S JUST THIS WHOLE
PRETENDING TO BE A LAWYER THING.

09:32.337 --> 09:33.704
I THINK WE SHOULD
SLIP THE PIN

09:33.772 --> 09:35.940
BACK IN THE GRENADE
ON THAT ONE.

09:37.692 --> 09:38.692
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

09:38.760 --> 09:40.227
YOU DON'T THINK
I SHOULD PLAY?

09:40.295 --> 09:42.763
NO, I DON'T.
THERE'S MANY WAYS

09:42.830 --> 09:44.248
THIS THING COULD GO SOUTH,
AND THEN ALL OF SUDDEN

09:44.316 --> 09:45.316
THEY DON'T
LOVE YOU SO MUCH,

09:45.384 --> 09:47.585
AND THEN THEY
DON'T LOVE ME SO MUCH.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.270
SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS LAWYER-WISE,

09:49.337 --> 09:52.706
YOU DON'T THINK I HAVE
ENOUGH CONVINCIBILITY.

09:54.225 --> 09:55.994
CONVINCIBILITY?

09:56.061 --> 09:59.364
OK, YOU'RE GONNA
COMMIT TO THAT WORD?

09:59.431 --> 10:00.714
SHUT UP.

10:02.017 --> 10:03.784
I CAN PASS AS A LAWYER, NO PROBLEM.

10:03.852 --> 10:06.087
DOUG, LOOK, YOU CAN PASS
AS A LOT OF THINGS, OK?

10:06.154 --> 10:08.756
FURNACE GUY, UH, ROOFER,

10:08.823 --> 10:09.740
MALL SECURITY,

10:09.892 --> 10:12.409
ANYTHING IN THE MALL,
REALLY, BUT LAWYER?

10:13.695 --> 10:16.464
THAT'S FUNNY, 'CAUSE
EVERYBODY AT THE FIRM

10:16.531 --> 10:18.932
SEEMS TO THINK I CAN
HANDLE IT JUST FINE.

10:19.000 --> 10:20.184
THEY'RE SENDING ME A LIMO
FOR THE FREAKIN' GAMES,

10:20.251 --> 10:21.986
AND AS I RECALL,
THEY'VE ASKED YOU

10:22.053 --> 10:23.754
TO ANSWER MY PHONE!

10:25.089 --> 10:26.457
IF YOU DON'T
WATCH YOUR STEP,

10:26.525 --> 10:28.092
YOU'RE GONNA BE MAKING
YOUR NEXT POT OF POTATOES

10:28.160 --> 10:30.094
ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT LINE.

10:33.065 --> 10:34.432
NOT THESE, THOUGH.
I WANT THESE.

10:36.335 --> 10:37.035
TAKE THE CHECK.

10:37.102 --> 10:38.335
NO.
PLEASE.

10:38.403 --> 10:39.553
I CAN'T SLEEP.

10:39.621 --> 10:41.406
I WAS TOSSING
AND TURNING ALL NIGHT.

10:41.473 --> 10:43.074
MY SHEETS ARE
SOAKED WITH SWEAT.

10:43.142 --> 10:44.342
FEEL THEM. NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

10:44.410 --> 10:45.510
FEEL THEM!
I BELIEVE YOU.

10:45.577 --> 10:47.211
FINE. I'LL TAKE
THE MONEY, OK?

10:47.279 --> 10:49.413
THANK YOU.

10:49.481 --> 10:52.966
HUH. $237.

10:53.034 --> 10:54.702
I THINK
THAT'S A FAIR NUMBER.

10:54.770 --> 10:55.619
IT'S A LITTLE RANDOM.

10:55.771 --> 10:57.404
I MEAN, HOW'D YOU
COME UP WITH THAT?

10:57.472 --> 10:59.674
SIMPLE. THERE WERE
12 SLAVES ON THE FARM,

10:59.741 --> 11:02.576
BUT MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER
ONLY OWNED HALF THE FARM.

11:02.644 --> 11:04.428
OF HIS 6,
2 LIVED IN THE HOUSE.

11:04.496 --> 11:06.864
LET'S FACE IT.
THAT'S A SWEET DEAL.

11:13.322 --> 11:15.756
DOUG, WE'RE GONNA BE
AT THE GAME IN 10 MINUTES.

11:15.824 --> 11:16.990
FOCUS.

11:17.058 --> 11:18.859
WHERE DID YOU
GO TO LAW SCHOOL?

11:18.927 --> 11:20.160
EXCUSE ME. AHEM.

11:20.228 --> 11:23.581
JEREMY? DOUG
FROM THE BACK AGAIN.

11:23.648 --> 11:24.532
YEAH, LISTEN.

11:24.599 --> 11:25.999
COULD YOU GOOSE UP
THE HEAT A BIT?

11:26.067 --> 11:27.718
I'M A LITTLE TIGHT.

11:27.786 --> 11:29.287
THANK YOU.

11:30.555 --> 11:32.790
YOU, GO.

11:32.857 --> 11:35.226
WHERE DID YOU
GO TO LAW SCHOOL?

11:35.294 --> 11:36.660
I DIDN'T.
I WAS HOMESCHOOLED.

11:36.728 --> 11:39.130
DOUG, COME ON! YOU SAID YOU'D
LET ME COACH YOU THROUGH THIS.

11:39.197 --> 11:40.998
ALL RIGHT, FINE.
IF ANYBODY ASKS,

11:41.066 --> 11:42.934
I'LL JUST SAY
I WENT TO STAMFORD.

11:43.001 --> 11:46.137
I'M SORRY. DID YOU JUST SAY
"STAMFORD" WITH AN "M"?

11:46.204 --> 11:48.272
YEAH.
STAMFORD LAW SCHOOL.

11:48.340 --> 11:49.956
OK, THE SCHOOL
YOU'RE THINKING OF

11:50.024 --> 11:52.443
IS STANFORD,
WITH AN "N."

11:52.511 --> 11:54.011
NO. IT'S STAMFORD.

11:54.079 --> 11:55.279
I KNOW.
I DELIVERED THERE.

11:55.346 --> 11:56.814
I'VE SEEN THE SIGN.

11:56.881 --> 11:57.731
OK, DUMB-ASS,

11:57.799 --> 12:00.567
YOU'RE THINKING OF
STAMFORD, CONNECTICUT, OK?

12:00.635 --> 12:03.621
STANFORD LAW SCHOOL
IS IN CALIFORNIA.

12:04.523 --> 12:05.739
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:05.807 --> 12:07.675
I DON'T LIKE ALL THIS
NEGATIVITY BEFORE A GAME.

12:07.742 --> 12:09.860
IT'S DISCO TIME.

12:28.680 --> 12:31.282
HOW LONG YOU BEEN
AT KAPLAN HORNSTEIN?

12:31.350 --> 12:33.217
ACTUALLY,
I, UH, JUST STARTED.

12:33.285 --> 12:34.519
WHERE WERE YOU
BEFORE THAT?

12:34.586 --> 12:39.323
I WAS OVER AT CARSON...
DALY... AND LEIBOWITZ.

12:52.371 --> 12:55.239
DOUG HEFFERNAN'S
OFFICE.

12:55.307 --> 12:57.475
NO, DOUG.
NO MESSAGES.

13:10.238 --> 13:12.590
SO, THE BAILIFF WALKS IN,
AND HE'S LIKE, "ALL RISE."

13:12.658 --> 13:13.591
I'M LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:13.659 --> 13:14.758
I DON'T FEEL
LIKE RISING TODAY."

13:14.826 --> 13:15.993
AND I DIDN'T.

13:16.061 --> 13:17.961
YOU'RE
CRAZY, HEFFERNAN.

13:18.029 --> 13:19.863
YOU KNOW ME.
I DON'T CARE.

13:39.701 --> 13:41.419
DOUG HEFFERNAN'S
OFFICE.

13:41.486 --> 13:44.855
NOT LOVING THE WAY
YOU'RE ANSWERING MY PHONE.

13:44.923 --> 13:46.240
I'M BUSY.

13:46.308 --> 13:48.592
I'M JUST SAYING YOU COULD
BE A LITTLE FRIENDLIER.

13:48.660 --> 13:50.060
"GOOD AFTERNOON,
AND THANK YOU

13:50.128 --> 13:51.662
"FOR CALLING
MR. HEFFERNAN'S OFFICE.

13:51.730 --> 13:53.764
HOW MAY I
ASSIST YOU TODAY?"

13:53.832 --> 13:55.132
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

13:55.200 --> 13:56.817
JUST CHECKING TO SEE
IF I GOT ANY MESSAGES.

13:56.884 --> 13:59.836
FOR THE 40th TIME,
NO MESSAGES.

13:59.988 --> 14:03.958
NOT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE
LOOKING FOR A FAKE LAWYER.

14:06.861 --> 14:08.795
HONEY, YOUR OTHER LINE
IS RINGING.

14:08.863 --> 14:11.432
BE CHARMING. USE THE GOOD
GREETING. "GOOD AFTERNOON"-

14:11.500 --> 14:13.967
DOUG HEFFERNAN'S OFFICE.

14:14.035 --> 14:17.338
UH, NO, HE'S NOT IN.

14:17.406 --> 14:19.807
COULD YOU HOLD ON
FOR ONE SECOND, SIR?

14:19.874 --> 14:21.225
THANKS SO MUCH.

14:21.343 --> 14:22.443
I GOTTA CALL YOU BACK.

14:22.511 --> 14:23.227
WAIT. WHO IS IT?

14:23.295 --> 14:25.362
GARY ROGERS FROM
EPSTEIN & EPSTEIN.

14:25.430 --> 14:26.763
HE'S CALLING
TO CONGRATULATE YOU

14:26.831 --> 14:28.232
ON A GREAT GAME
ON SATURDAY.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.134
REALLY?
PATCH ME THROUGH.

14:30.201 --> 14:31.869
NO, I'M NOT GOING
TO PATCH YOU THROUGH.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.537
HE'S A SENIOR PARTNER.

14:33.605 --> 14:36.440
I CAN HANDLE IT. DO YOUR
JOB, AND YOU PATCH ME THROUGH.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.558
FINE, BUT JUST
TAKE THE COMPLIMENT,

14:38.626 --> 14:41.295
SAY "THANK YOU," AND HANG UP
AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

14:44.849 --> 14:47.217
OH, THANKS FOR
JOINING US, DOUG.

14:47.286 --> 14:49.019
OH, THANKS
FOR CALLING ME.

14:49.087 --> 14:51.372
NOTHING LIKE A GOOD MAR-TOONI
AFTER A TOUGH DAY AT...

14:51.439 --> 14:53.140
LAW.

14:53.208 --> 14:54.125
I HEAR THAT.

14:54.192 --> 14:55.426
IT DOES GET
TO BE A GRIND.

14:55.494 --> 14:57.027
YES, IT DO, BUT...

14:57.095 --> 14:58.829
I WOULDN'T TRADE IT FOR
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD.

14:58.896 --> 15:01.232
OH, YOU LOVE YOUR WORK, HUH?

15:01.300 --> 15:03.700
I DO. I REALLY DO.

15:09.791 --> 15:12.109
IN A LOT OF WAYS,
UH-AHEM-

15:12.177 --> 15:13.143
BEING A LAWYER,

15:13.211 --> 15:15.613
WHICH I THINK WE CAN
AGREE WE ALL ARE...

15:17.516 --> 15:18.682
IS A LOT LIKE, UH,

15:18.749 --> 15:22.252
BEING A PACKAGE
DELIVERY GUY.

15:22.320 --> 15:23.904
HOW SO, DOUG?

15:23.972 --> 15:26.374
OH, UH, WELL, YOU...

15:26.441 --> 15:27.441
KNOCK ON DOORS,

15:27.509 --> 15:30.578
AND YOU HOPE YOU
DON'T GET BIT BY A DOG.

15:30.645 --> 15:32.662
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN IN
FRONT OF JUDGE FARNSWORTH.

15:34.032 --> 15:35.332
GOOD OLD FARNSWORTH.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.517
HEY, FARNSIE!

15:42.990 --> 15:44.758
OH, ANYWAY, DOUG,

15:44.825 --> 15:46.410
LET ME CUT TO THE CHASE.

15:46.477 --> 15:48.012
WE WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST

15:48.079 --> 15:51.215
IN COMING OVER TO EPSTEIN,
EPSTEIN, ROGERS & WOLF.

15:51.282 --> 15:54.485
TO DO WHAT?

15:54.553 --> 15:56.853
I DON'T KNOW.
CORPORATE LITIGATION?

15:56.921 --> 15:58.188
WE'LL FIND
A PLACE FOR YOU,

15:58.256 --> 16:02.042
AS LONG AS YOU BRING THAT
BIG BAT OF YOURS WITH YOU.

16:02.110 --> 16:05.412
SO, WHAT'S KAPLAN
PAYING YOU OVER THERE?

16:06.732 --> 16:09.567
OH, I-I GET
THE GOING RATE...

16:09.634 --> 16:14.071
AND AN EXTRA $10
FOR EACH CONVICTION.

16:14.138 --> 16:18.075
WELL, I'M PREPARED TO
OFFER YOU A BASE OF 150,000.

16:18.143 --> 16:19.276
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

16:32.307 --> 16:33.540
HEY, GUYS.

16:34.709 --> 16:35.959
WHY ARE YOU WEARING A SUIT?

16:36.027 --> 16:38.896
WHAT'D YOU DO?

16:39.997 --> 16:42.065
NOTHING. JUST HAD A LITTLE
POWER LUNCH WITH THE BOYS

16:42.133 --> 16:44.568
OVER AT EPSTEIN,
EPSTEIN, ROGERS AND...

16:44.636 --> 16:46.437
WOLF?
BINGO.

16:46.504 --> 16:47.855
YOU HAD LUNCH WITH THEM?

16:47.922 --> 16:50.924
I TOLD YOU JUST TO SAY
THANK YOU AND HANG UP!

16:50.992 --> 16:52.325
WELL, I TRIED,
BUT THEN THEY ASKED ME

16:52.393 --> 16:53.343
IF I ENJOYED
A GOOD STEAK,

16:53.495 --> 16:54.661
TO WHICH I RESPONDED,

16:54.729 --> 16:56.830
"I CARRY MY OWN KNIFE."

16:56.898 --> 16:58.765
WELL, WHAT THE HELL
DID YOU TALK ABOUT?

16:58.833 --> 17:01.401
WELL, FIRST,
WE TALKED ABOUT OUR KIDS-

17:01.469 --> 17:04.471
BY THE WAY,
IF IT COMES UP, WE HAVE 2.

17:05.906 --> 17:06.973
AND THEN-

17:07.040 --> 17:08.742
WELL, THEN
THEY OFFERED ME A JOB.

17:08.810 --> 17:10.077
WHAT?

17:10.145 --> 17:11.395
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL BRING YOU OVER WITH ME,

17:11.463 --> 17:13.847
YOU KNOW,
ONCE I GET SETTLED.

17:13.914 --> 17:15.449
YOU TOOK THE JOB?

17:15.517 --> 17:17.550
WELL, NOT YET,
BUT I'M MULLING IT OVER.

17:17.617 --> 17:19.185
CONGRATULATIONS,
DOUGLAS.

17:21.071 --> 17:22.739
HE'S NOT A LAWYER.

17:22.807 --> 17:24.040
YOU'RE NOT A LAWYER.

17:24.108 --> 17:25.276
REALLY? WHY
DON'T YOU TELL THAT

17:25.343 --> 17:26.960
TO THE 2 FIRMS
CURRENTLY WOOING ME?

17:27.028 --> 17:29.329
MY GOD.
ARE YOU INSANE?

17:29.397 --> 17:30.614
THE MAN
JUST MADE LAWYER.

17:30.681 --> 17:33.217
WHY DO YOU HAVE
TO PISS ALL OVER IT?

17:34.535 --> 17:35.970
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.

17:36.037 --> 17:37.238
EVER SINCE
THIS WHOLE THING STARTED,

17:37.305 --> 17:39.006
SHE'S BEEN
KNOCKING ME DOWN.

17:39.074 --> 17:40.007
AS FAR AS
I'M CONCERNED,

17:40.075 --> 17:41.141
IF THEY HIRE HIM
AS A LAWYER,

17:41.209 --> 17:42.709
HE'S A LAWYER.

17:42.777 --> 17:44.394
WHEN I GOT HIRED AS
A SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGIST,

17:44.462 --> 17:45.963
DO YOU THINK I KNEW THE
FIRST THING ABOUT IT?

17:46.030 --> 17:46.763
THANK YOU.

17:46.831 --> 17:48.549
<i>THANK YOU.</i>

17:50.051 --> 17:51.852
WELL, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH, DAD.

17:51.920 --> 17:53.320
COULD YOU-WHAT?
COULD YOU MOVE THIS CRAP?

17:53.388 --> 17:54.588
WHAT IS THIS?

17:54.656 --> 17:56.890
THAT'S
MY ANCESTRY REPORT.

17:56.958 --> 17:58.491
THIS ISN'T
EVEN FOR YOU.

17:58.560 --> 18:01.428
THIS IS
FOR ARTHUR SPINNER.

18:05.867 --> 18:07.934
DEACON, THANK YOU FOR THE
RIDE TO THE SENIOR CENTER.

18:08.002 --> 18:09.470
YOU DRIVE WONDERFULLY.

18:09.537 --> 18:11.037
YOU'RE WELCOME,
AND BY THE WAY,

18:11.105 --> 18:12.072
WITH THAT MONEY
YOU GAVE ME,

18:12.139 --> 18:13.857
I PUT SOME SWEET NEW
SPEAKERS IN MY CAR.

18:13.925 --> 18:15.542
HERE. CHECK IT OUT.

18:15.610 --> 18:17.277
MARVELOUS. VERY RHYTHMIC.

18:17.345 --> 18:19.797
THAT BEING SAID,

18:19.864 --> 18:21.498
YOU'LL HAVE
TO RETURN THEM.

18:21.565 --> 18:23.300
WHAT?

18:23.368 --> 18:26.036
I GOT THE WRONG
ANCESTRY REPORT.

18:26.104 --> 18:28.305
MY FAMILY WERE
ACTUALLY IRISH GYPSIES.

18:28.372 --> 18:32.176
WE NEVER OWNED SLAVES.
WE WERE DRUNKEN THIEVES.

18:33.160 --> 18:34.178
SO?

18:34.245 --> 18:37.181
SO I WANT
MY MONEY BACK.

18:37.248 --> 18:39.566
LOOK, YOU FORCED ME TO TAKE
THE MONEY IN THE FIRST PLACE.

18:39.634 --> 18:41.501
I BOUGHT SPEAKERS.
THEY'RE NOW PART OF MY CAR.

18:41.569 --> 18:42.902
I'M NOT GIVING YOU
YOUR MONEY BACK.

18:42.970 --> 18:43.771
WELL, I THINK YOU ARE!

18:43.838 --> 18:45.522
OH, I THINK I'M NOT!

18:45.589 --> 18:48.091
DAMN IT, MAN! YOU TOOK THOSE
REPARATIONS UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

18:48.159 --> 18:49.527
NO, I TOOK
THOSE REPARATIONS

18:49.594 --> 18:51.511
TO GET THE HELL
OUT OF YOUR BASEMENT.

18:53.798 --> 18:55.332
LOOK, ARTHUR,

18:55.400 --> 18:56.833
I'D GIVE YOU YOUR MONEY BACK IF I COULD,

18:56.901 --> 18:59.770
BUT I'M SORRY. I JUST DON'T
HAVE THE CASH RIGHT NOW.

19:01.256 --> 19:03.056
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THIS?

19:03.124 --> 19:06.526
IN LIEU OF CASH,
MAYBE YOU CAN PAY ME BACK

19:06.594 --> 19:10.130
IN SOME TYPE OF... SERVICES.

19:10.198 --> 19:12.082
HUH?

19:12.149 --> 19:14.084
YOU KNOW, HELP OUT
AROUND THE HOUSE.

19:14.151 --> 19:16.320
PERHAPS...

19:16.387 --> 19:18.855
WORK THE YARD A BIT.

19:23.094 --> 19:26.513
YOU WANT ME
TO BE YOUR SLAVE?

19:28.099 --> 19:29.232
IT'S NOT MY FIRST CHOICE,

19:29.300 --> 19:32.169
BUT IT WOULD GET US
OUT OF THIS MESS.

19:39.193 --> 19:41.295
HEY. DID YOU TALK
TO ROGERS?

19:41.362 --> 19:42.462
DID YOU TELL HIM
NO YET?

19:42.530 --> 19:43.863
NO, I HAVEN'T
TALKED TO HIM YET.

19:43.931 --> 19:45.432
I'M STILL MULLING.

19:45.500 --> 19:48.769
AND YOU'RE
STILL NOT A LAWYER.

19:56.611 --> 19:59.846
I'D BE
AN AWESOME LAWYER.

20:01.666 --> 20:03.133
OH!

20:44.825 --> 20:47.161
OH, GOD!

20:47.228 --> 20:49.896
OH, THAT IS NOT GOOD!

20:51.882 --> 20:54.902
BOY, THEY SURE YANKED THAT
LIMO PRETTY QUICK, HUH?

20:57.906 --> 20:59.706
SHAMAHAMA!
