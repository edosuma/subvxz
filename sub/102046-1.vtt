WEBVTT

02:15.886 --> 02:19.264
Good Lord, look at you.
Well, get on in here.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.311
How you been, Grandma?

02:25.103 --> 02:26.647
Well, I'm living.

02:27.231 --> 02:29.316
I thought you were coming in earlier.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.610
Well, bus was late.

02:32.361 --> 02:36.490
I would've picked you up in town,
only they won't let me drive no more.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.118
I straightened up your room.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.871
Put some things in the closet.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.582
You go on. Go get settled.

02:45.666 --> 02:46.792
Okay.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.182
Yeah.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.944
Yeah, you got this lookin' good, huh?

03:14.736 --> 03:17.322
Son of a bitch. Goddamn it.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.491
-Hey, Shelly. Shell, Shell, Shell.
-Yeah?

03:20.284 --> 03:21.910
You take my fucking wallet again?

03:22.995 --> 03:26.248
Yeah, I stole it.
There was so much money in it.

03:29.251 --> 03:31.336
I'll be back in, I don't know,
a couple days.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.880
Can't wait.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.593
That woman is nothing but trouble.

03:37.676 --> 03:41.972
If it wasn't for her little boy,
I'd kick her right out of that trailer.

03:42.055 --> 03:45.434
I imagine it's gonna take
some time getting used to.

03:45.934 --> 03:46.935
Yeah.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.147
You just gotta get yourself
back out there.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.481
That's all.

03:51.565 --> 03:54.026
You can't be feeling sorry for yourself.

03:54.526 --> 03:55.569
No, ma'am.

03:56.862 --> 03:59.781
And I go to church every Sunday.

03:59.865 --> 04:02.451
If you're living here, you will too.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.469
You know the conditions
of your parole, right?

04:20.552 --> 04:21.637
Yes, sir.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.055
You'll submit to drug testing.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.973
You'll come in every two weeks,
right here.

04:25.474 --> 04:30.020
You are to obey all laws:
municipal, parish, state, federal.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.355
And you'll get a job.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.482
Sound good?

04:35.901 --> 04:37.319
Any idea where you gonna work?

04:38.320 --> 04:39.780
No. See what's out there.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.157
Then I'll see you in a couple weeks.

04:46.662 --> 04:47.955
I'll tell you what.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.832
I'll give you a call if something
opens up, try to help you out.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.001
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

05:20.904 --> 05:23.448
-Palmer?
-When the fuck did you get out, man?

05:24.867 --> 05:26.034
Holy shit!

05:26.118 --> 05:28.245
Thought you weren't getting out
for five more years, man.

05:28.328 --> 05:30.539
-I didn't know you could grow a beard.
-All right.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.499
Hey, you should've told me
you was coming home.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.293
I'd have throwed you a goddamn party.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.628
-Oh, yeah? Who'd have shown up?
-Dumbass Ned.

05:36.712 --> 05:38.463
-Of course I would've.
-See?

05:38.547 --> 05:40.132
The last time I talked to you,

05:40.215 --> 05:42.968
I threw that money at your commissary
like you was asking,

05:43.051 --> 05:45.637
-but, you know, I never heard from you.
-Thank you, man.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.014
You still on that second marriage?

05:47.097 --> 05:48.765
Hey, don't even get me started.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.768
I don't know what I was thinking.
And now I got a eight-year-old,

05:51.852 --> 05:54.438
and Darleen's still kicking me in the nuts
every chance she gets.

05:54.521 --> 05:57.774
-How's little Jake doing?
-Little Jake is 15 years old, man.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.359
-Fifteen?
-Fifteen.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.528
-Jesus.
-Yep. He's a hell of a ballplayer too.

06:01.612 --> 06:02.613
-Yeah, man.
-Is he now?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.281
-Just like his daddy.
-I'll bet.

06:04.364 --> 06:07.326
Hey, you know, your TD record
only just got broke a couple years ago.

06:07.409 --> 06:09.036
-No shit?
-Some little freshman kid.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.705
-Freshman?
-Holy cow.

06:12.206 --> 06:14.958
Look who it is. Palmer.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.794
-When'd you get out?
-A few days ago.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.463
Wow.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.631
Looks good on you.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.634
Oh, yeah. Well, you know my daddy.
It's not like I had a choice.

06:24.927 --> 06:26.094
It's good to see you.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.304
Yeah, you too.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.641
-You staying down there at Vivian's place?
-Yeah, for now.

06:30.724 --> 06:33.101
If you need anything,
you let me know, all right?

06:33.185 --> 06:34.978
I mean that. Anything.

06:35.062 --> 06:38.607
Shit. I need your old man to quit writing
me all these goddamn speeding tickets.

06:38.690 --> 06:40.067
-I don't wanna hear it.
-Let's play some pool.

06:40.150 --> 06:42.027
Hey, Ned, let's get a game in
before the wife calls.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.071
Palmer, you're next.

06:45.656 --> 06:46.907
There you go.

06:47.866 --> 06:48.951
Appreciate you.

06:49.952 --> 06:53.789
-Cosimo, how's it hanging?
-And what do you want?

06:54.289 --> 06:56.750
I want my nails done and my ass waxed.

06:56.834 --> 06:58.377
What do you think I want?

07:00.796 --> 07:02.422
Get me a Jim and Coke.

07:14.268 --> 07:16.061
You're Vivian's grandson, ain't you?

07:20.274 --> 07:21.859
What's the matter, handsome?

07:24.194 --> 07:25.529
You don't talk?

07:37.541 --> 07:39.543
You really did just get outta prison.

08:50.072 --> 08:52.199
Eddie. Eddie, wake up.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.284
We're gonna be late for church.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.167
This boy's gonna make us late, I swear.

09:07.840 --> 09:12.386
Church starts at 10:00 a.m.
Now don't go making us late.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.595
Sorry.

09:31.697 --> 09:35.075
Sam, this is my grandson, Eddie.

09:35.158 --> 09:40.747
Now, he would prefer you call him Palmer,
even though Eddie's a much nicer name.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.128
You had a sleepover with my mama,

09:46.795 --> 09:49.631
and you didn't wear no pajamas
or underwear neither.

09:49.715 --> 09:50.716
Sam.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.385
Roll that window up.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.346
It took me two hours to do my hair.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.238
Dot, you remember Eddie?

10:13.322 --> 10:15.866
Eddie, this is Dot.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.951
My grandson.

10:21.288 --> 10:23.040
-Stop.
-Toby, get off him.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.250
Good morning, everybody.
I'd like to welcome you

10:25.334 --> 10:26.668
to Wesley Chapel this morning.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.964
Must be strange being back here, huh?

10:31.048 --> 10:32.633
You ain't kidding.

10:32.716 --> 10:37.179
Well, not much has changed.
Still all about church and football.

10:37.763 --> 10:40.557
-Amen.
-They did open a new coffee shop though.

10:41.767 --> 10:44.228
-Eddie.
-Chief.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.105
-Heard you got out early.
-Yes, sir.

10:47.773 --> 10:50.692
Well, you make sure
to keep yourself in check.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.986
I would hate
to have to put you back inside.

10:54.738 --> 10:55.739
Yes, sir.

10:56.740 --> 11:00.160
-See you down at the station.
-Yeah, Dad.

11:00.244 --> 11:02.162
Shit. Sorry about that.

11:02.246 --> 11:03.413
Same old fart.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.791
Yeah, I'd be surprised
if he hadn't come over.

11:07.292 --> 11:10.128
Look, I just wanted to say
that I should've came and visited you

11:10.212 --> 11:12.130
or sent you a letter at least.

11:12.798 --> 11:14.258
I should've been a better friend.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.093
Forget it.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.095
-What's going on?
-Hey.

11:18.178 --> 11:19.638
Same shit, different Sunday.

11:19.721 --> 11:23.684
Christ. There's something
seriously wrong with that kid.

11:34.486 --> 11:37.573
Here now. Give this to your mother.

11:37.990 --> 11:41.368
Make sure she eats some.
And it'll keep for a week.

11:41.451 --> 11:44.288
-Thanks, Miss Vivian.
-Sweet boy.

11:44.371 --> 11:45.998
-Bye, Miss Vivian.
-Bye-bye.

11:46.623 --> 11:47.833
Bye, Palmer.

11:55.674 --> 11:57.259
Good night, Grandma.

11:57.342 --> 12:00.804
Sweet dreams, Eddie. I'm glad you're back.

12:02.598 --> 12:03.599
Me too.

12:30.542 --> 12:34.046
-You slept late.
-Yeah. Guess I did.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.715
I need some things from the market

12:36.798 --> 12:39.593
if you don't mind picking them up
on the way home.

12:40.802 --> 12:41.803
Yeah, sure.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.765
And hold on. Let me give you some money.

12:45.349 --> 12:48.060
I don't imagine you have any.

12:49.603 --> 12:50.771
Yeah.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.981
Be careful out there.

12:53.690 --> 12:54.900
I'll be back later.

12:55.526 --> 12:57.444
Hey, I ain't kidding. You need to shave,

12:57.528 --> 12:59.780
'cause you give me rug burn down here
and it really hurts.

12:59.863 --> 13:02.699
I'll shave for you, 'cause God knows
I love you, and I love your strawberry.

13:02.783 --> 13:06.119
-Who's that guy over there?
-Tell me again how much you love me.

13:07.955 --> 13:09.081
Whatever.

13:10.249 --> 13:11.917
He's just looking.

13:15.963 --> 13:18.590
-Thank you.
-Thank you. Have a nice day.

13:18.674 --> 13:21.051
-Hello.
-Hello.

13:25.097 --> 13:27.057
Would you like an application?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.225
Yeah, sure.

13:28.892 --> 13:32.312
I filled that position this morning.

13:33.063 --> 13:34.773
-Hey, Eddie. How you been?
-Hogan.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.859
Just forgot to take the sign down is all.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.319
Good to see you.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.029
You too.

13:43.532 --> 13:47.286
I'm sorry.
I thought that they were still hiring.

13:49.454 --> 13:50.455
It's fine.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.374
What side do you want?

13:52.958 --> 13:53.959
This side.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.171
I think I can spice that up a little.

13:57.254 --> 13:58.338
That's good.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.845
His mama took off again.

14:04.928 --> 14:07.264
He'll be staying with us till she's back.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.394
I think I need a little color.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.105
On the way.

14:16.899 --> 14:17.941
Thank you.

14:20.027 --> 14:23.238
You're gonna have to sleep
out here on the couch.

14:23.322 --> 14:25.324
Sam gets your bed at night.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.286
I don't mind the couch, Miss Vivian.
I sleep on it at home.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.873
A boy your age needs to sleep on a bed.

14:32.956 --> 14:33.957
I don't mind.

14:34.041 --> 14:35.167
I can watch TV.

14:36.210 --> 14:39.171
Now, too much TV ain't good for you.

14:40.464 --> 14:42.883
Excuse me. Just want these.

14:45.677 --> 14:47.471
My friend Emily gave me this.

14:48.805 --> 14:52.392
Every time she gets a new doll,
I get one of her old ones.

14:53.268 --> 14:54.269
Fuck.

14:54.770 --> 14:58.232
Her dog chewed this one up,
but it's still okay.

14:58.315 --> 15:00.526
She just has to hop a little. See?

15:02.236 --> 15:03.654
You know you're a boy, right?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.073
Yeah.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.450
Boys don't play with dolls.

15:09.284 --> 15:12.037
Well, I'm a boy, and I do.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.539
Dinner's ready!

15:14.873 --> 15:16.083
See you later, Palmer.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.504
-Meatballs.
-Thank you.

15:23.715 --> 15:25.968
Did you have any luck finding a job?

15:27.135 --> 15:28.136
Not yet.

15:28.220 --> 15:31.181
-I'm sure you will.
-Miss Vivian.

15:34.518 --> 15:38.146
-That's for her.
-We love our meatballs.

15:40.941 --> 15:44.027
One for you, and one for me.

15:46.405 --> 15:49.032
How long does your mama
usually stay gone for?

15:49.116 --> 15:50.868
You hush now.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.788
When you gonna give me
the rest of the change from the mart?

15:56.665 --> 15:59.334
-I gave it to you.
-Nah, I was short.

16:00.002 --> 16:01.170
What you mean "short"?

16:01.253 --> 16:03.672
I didn't get all my change.

16:08.093 --> 16:10.512
-Count it.
-I don't need to count it.

16:10.596 --> 16:11.638
It was short.

16:11.722 --> 16:15.017
Twelve dollars and 13 cents.
Go ahead. Count it.

16:16.852 --> 16:18.478
You eat your supper.

16:54.515 --> 16:55.516
Door's open.

17:00.354 --> 17:03.106
I'm Eddie Palmer.
I'm here for my interview.

17:03.982 --> 17:04.983
Come on in.

17:06.151 --> 17:07.736
Calvin Sibs. Have a seat.

17:10.739 --> 17:14.242
Fill this out, and we'll take
a walk over to see Principal Forbes.

17:16.411 --> 17:20.207
Mr. Palmer, I'm sorry, but I can't
hire you simply due to the fact that

17:20.999 --> 17:22.291
you're a convicted felon.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.671
I understand, sir.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.049
But I did my time, and I did it
without getting in any trouble.

17:29.716 --> 17:30.968
Well, that may be the case,

17:31.051 --> 17:33.720
but I have the safety of the children
I have to consider.

17:34.513 --> 17:36.640
I ain't never done nothing to no kids.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.310
If I can't get a job sweeping floors,

17:40.394 --> 17:43.063
then y'all tell me,
what am I supposed to do?

17:44.189 --> 17:46.149
Mr. Sibs, your thoughts?

17:47.192 --> 17:52.447
He's got the experience:
twelve years of laundry, kitchen and yard.

17:53.866 --> 17:54.992
But it's your call.

18:01.540 --> 18:04.209
You were All-USA player
two years in a row at Riverside?

18:04.710 --> 18:05.794
Yes, sir.

18:05.878 --> 18:07.754
Football scholarship to LSU?

18:10.090 --> 18:11.091
Palmer.

18:11.675 --> 18:13.260
You related to Vivian Palmer?

18:13.343 --> 18:15.220
Yes, sir. That's my grandmother.

18:15.846 --> 18:19.558
Well, she's a respectable member
of our congregation.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.269
Yes, sir. I attended with her last Sunday.

18:23.020 --> 18:24.771
Beautiful sermon.

18:26.857 --> 18:28.609
All right, I tell you what.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.154
I'm a big fan of second chances.

18:32.237 --> 18:35.032
So, let me run all this
by the school board,

18:35.115 --> 18:37.701
and let me see if I can pull some strings
and make something happen.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.203
Thank you. Thank you.

18:39.286 --> 18:40.454
You're welcome.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.581
We thank you for this meal

18:42.664 --> 18:45.667
and for allowing the three of us
to be here together.

18:45.751 --> 18:47.211
-Amen.
-Amen.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.337
Amen.

18:51.173 --> 18:54.009
Miss Vivian,
you never said you were sorry...

18:55.093 --> 18:58.597
for yesterday when you said
he shorted you, but he didn't.

19:00.933 --> 19:02.351
Sam, drink your milk.

19:06.355 --> 19:07.981
I miscounted.

19:08.690 --> 19:10.192
I apologize.

19:10.692 --> 19:11.735
It's okay.

19:14.905 --> 19:16.156
Want me to get it?

19:18.617 --> 19:20.536
-No greens, no TV.
-Hello.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.371
-Yes, it is.
-Yes, ma'am.

19:22.454 --> 19:23.539
Yes, sir.

19:25.165 --> 19:28.168
Thank you. Okay. See you then.

19:34.383 --> 19:35.384
Got a job.

19:38.387 --> 19:39.847
Good for you, Palmer.

19:41.056 --> 19:42.391
-Oh, good.
-Cheers.

19:43.141 --> 19:46.812
Now, bathrooms and classrooms
get done every day.

19:48.063 --> 19:51.900
We're the first that unlock the doors.
Kids get here soon after.

19:51.984 --> 19:54.820
Make sure you get here on time.
You need to wear this.

19:55.237 --> 19:56.238
Okay.

19:56.989 --> 19:58.532
Should I get a set of keys?

19:59.241 --> 20:00.742
Let's see how it goes first.

20:13.130 --> 20:16.550
When you finish this, the air conditioner
in Maggie Hayes's room is busted.

20:16.633 --> 20:18.343
-I need you to fix it.
-Yes, sir.

20:18.427 --> 20:19.720
Gonna need these.

20:22.097 --> 20:23.682
Good job, Kayleigh.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.518
-I like those details.
-Snowflakes.

20:26.602 --> 20:29.521
I love that. Is that a house or a church?

20:30.606 --> 20:33.358
Stacy, I told you, put that away.

20:36.528 --> 20:38.363
Ma'am, air conditioner.

20:38.447 --> 20:40.949
Oh, yes. It's this one. Thank God.

20:43.202 --> 20:44.203
Palmer.

20:46.455 --> 20:49.082
-That's Palmer.
-"That's Palmer."

20:49.666 --> 20:51.793
Great. So, hopefully you can fix this.

20:51.877 --> 20:53.462
It's been making a crazy noise.

20:53.545 --> 20:55.589
It's been really hot,
and we haven't been able to use it.

20:55.672 --> 20:56.840
Stop, Toby!

20:56.924 --> 20:59.343
-Toby?
-I didn't do nothing.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.304
How would you feel
if someone did that to your painting?

21:02.387 --> 21:04.973
Go and get a paper towel
and help clean that up.

21:05.557 --> 21:07.267
All right, everybody, keep going.

21:21.865 --> 21:22.866
Four o'clock.

21:22.950 --> 21:25.827
I know. I know.
Hey, Palmer, you met my wife yet, Lucille?

21:25.911 --> 21:27.579
-I haven't.
-It's nice to meet you.

21:27.663 --> 21:28.664
-You too.
-Heard a lot about you.

21:28.747 --> 21:30.415
You two have known each other
since you were little, huh?

21:30.499 --> 21:32.668
Yeah. Since we were five.
He was a little skinnier back then.

21:32.751 --> 21:33.836
Hey, we're working on that.

21:33.919 --> 21:35.921
Emily, come on.
Get your butt in this car. Let's go.

21:36.004 --> 21:38.590
It's just shameful
the way his mama carries on.

21:38.674 --> 21:41.635
I can't believe the state
hasn't taken him away already.

21:41.718 --> 21:45.264
He ain't no trouble, Dot. Now, shush.

21:45.347 --> 21:47.599
I'm telling you, you can't keep that boy.

21:50.269 --> 21:54.022
Some people just have too much to say.

21:54.106 --> 21:55.691
Who has too much to say?

21:56.149 --> 22:00.320
Stop listening
to our adult conversations, Sam.

22:01.196 --> 22:04.116
But, Miss Vivian, I'm right here.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.493
Don't mean you have to listen.

22:09.288 --> 22:12.624
Dot's always sticking her nose
in other people's business.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.209
Whose business?

22:14.293 --> 22:16.461
I told you, stop listening, Sam.

22:17.296 --> 22:20.424
I can't stop listening, Miss Vivian,
if you keep talking.

22:20.966 --> 22:22.176
Jeez Louise!

22:24.469 --> 22:26.096
Hi, I'm Penelope.

22:26.180 --> 22:29.391
This is my world in the sky,
and these are my friends.

22:30.017 --> 22:31.226
Welcome to the club.

22:31.310 --> 22:33.061
Get your wands ready.

22:33.145 --> 22:35.606
We fly together every day

22:35.689 --> 22:38.066
Making friends along the way

22:38.150 --> 22:40.402
Dot is cool and Phoebe's nice

22:40.485 --> 22:42.779
And I'm the one with sparkly tights

22:43.322 --> 22:45.115
Miss Vivian is still sleeping.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.745
Doesn't matter what people say

22:49.828 --> 22:52.331
Through the clouds we make our way

22:53.415 --> 22:54.499
Spread your wings

22:54.583 --> 22:57.461
In Penelope's Flying Princess Club

23:15.521 --> 23:17.856
We're here to celebrate Vivian Palmer,

23:18.524 --> 23:21.318
who we all hold deep in our hearts.

23:22.569 --> 23:27.366
In our celebration of remembering
her joy, laughter...

23:28.534 --> 23:30.035
and a life well lived,

23:30.827 --> 23:35.666
we will mourn Vivian
till we are once again reunited with her

23:35.749 --> 23:37.167
in the kingdom of heaven.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.590
Vivian was a fine woman.

23:46.552 --> 23:49.263
You take as much time
as you need, Palmer, all right?

25:25.651 --> 25:26.818
Where are we going?

25:30.739 --> 25:33.408
-Why'd I have to pack my bag?
-Don't worry about it.

25:44.002 --> 25:45.546
Come on. Get out.

25:55.889 --> 25:57.391
Come on.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.362
How long has she been gone this time?

26:10.445 --> 26:11.655
About two weeks now.

26:12.489 --> 26:14.700
And Vivian had him this whole time?

26:16.201 --> 26:19.037
Of course she did. I swear, this woman...

26:27.171 --> 26:29.673
I ain't here right now,
so leave a message.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.258
Or don't. I don't give a shit.

26:34.595 --> 26:37.097
Well, I can't take him home.

26:37.181 --> 26:39.600
I mean, Emily alone is a handful.

26:40.851 --> 26:44.354
And you sure you can't hang on to him
for a little bit longer? You got the room.

26:44.438 --> 26:45.522
He ain't my problem.

26:47.024 --> 26:49.234
All right. Leave him.

26:53.906 --> 26:56.491
I'll put in a call to child services.

26:59.328 --> 27:01.580
He's gonna have to go in the system.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.006
Palmer.

27:11.089 --> 27:12.299
Where are you going?

27:55.092 --> 27:56.218
Fuck.

29:25.474 --> 29:26.475
Palmer.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.367
Miss Maggie gave me a ride home.

29:44.451 --> 29:46.078
-Hello.
-Come on in.

29:46.161 --> 29:48.622
Yeah, I just thought I'd say hello.

29:48.705 --> 29:50.415
Can I get you something to drink?

29:51.291 --> 29:53.669
Water would be great. Thanks.

29:53.752 --> 29:54.753
Right, sure.

29:56.421 --> 29:59.925
I don't care what we do
as long as we do it together.

30:00.300 --> 30:03.971
-Last one to the moon is a beautiful egg.
-Beautiful?

30:04.054 --> 30:07.766
Miss Maggie, all the flying princesses
are flying to the moon.

30:07.850 --> 30:09.935
Can you imagine? The moon.

30:10.018 --> 30:11.520
That's amazing.

30:11.603 --> 30:13.021
I love this!

30:13.105 --> 30:15.274
Hold on. Slow down.

30:15.357 --> 30:16.900
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

30:16.984 --> 30:17.985
No problem.

30:19.236 --> 30:21.780
Flying to the moon is my favorite.

30:21.864 --> 30:24.741
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Vivian.

30:24.825 --> 30:28.662
I didn't know her well,
but she seemed like a really good person.

30:29.246 --> 30:30.664
She was a good woman.

30:30.747 --> 30:34.084
She actually was watching Sam
quite a bit lately.

30:35.043 --> 30:37.045
You wouldn't know where Shelly is,
would you?

30:38.380 --> 30:39.756
Your guess is as good as mine.

30:39.840 --> 30:41.383
One, two, three.

30:41.466 --> 30:43.218
Princess power. Princess power...

30:43.302 --> 30:44.887
So, how's it going?

30:46.221 --> 30:49.975
Good. Yeah, fine.

30:50.601 --> 30:53.145
She's never really gone for too long.

30:53.896 --> 30:55.189
How about this?

30:55.272 --> 30:57.357
You know, I just give you my phone number,

30:57.441 --> 31:01.111
and if you have any questions,
or if you need anything,

31:01.195 --> 31:03.572
or if it's too much,
you just give me a call.

31:04.239 --> 31:06.074
Yeah, sure. That'd be helpful.

31:06.158 --> 31:07.367
Do you have a cell phone?

31:07.451 --> 31:10.329
No. Well, there's... one on the wall.

31:10.829 --> 31:12.706
-May I?
-Yeah, sure.

31:12.789 --> 31:13.957
Old-school.

31:14.666 --> 31:16.668
I asked Sam if he wanted to stay with me,

31:16.752 --> 31:19.213
but he said he wanted
to stay here with you.

31:19.296 --> 31:20.380
Sparkles!

31:20.797 --> 31:22.216
This is good of you.

31:22.716 --> 31:25.427
You know, most people would've left him.

31:25.511 --> 31:28.514
Well, what was I supposed to do?

31:28.597 --> 31:30.641
Oh, my goodness. Is that a dragon?

31:30.724 --> 31:32.976
-Bye, Sam.
-Bye, Miss Maggie.

31:33.810 --> 31:35.020
Okay, thanks.

31:35.729 --> 31:38.273
I ain't here right now,
so leave a message.

31:38.357 --> 31:39.733
Or don't. I don't give a shit.

31:52.037 --> 31:53.038
What you playing?

31:54.164 --> 31:55.165
Solitaire.

31:56.458 --> 31:57.459
Can I play?

31:58.043 --> 31:59.795
Nope, it's for one player.

32:07.511 --> 32:09.346
Is this a boy or a girl?

32:12.391 --> 32:13.392
Did you wash today?

32:13.851 --> 32:16.103
Yeah, I washed earlier.

32:20.440 --> 32:21.650
You stink.

32:23.819 --> 32:25.320
Palmer!

32:33.412 --> 32:35.831
I just wanted to make sure
you were still here.

32:36.582 --> 32:38.417
-I'm watching TV.
-Okay.

32:41.044 --> 32:42.212
Palmer!

32:43.797 --> 32:45.215
Jesus Christ.

32:45.883 --> 32:47.092
What?

32:47.593 --> 32:50.095
You're not going anywhere, are you?

32:50.762 --> 32:52.556
No. I'm right here.

32:55.184 --> 32:56.393
Y'all ready to get out?

32:58.020 --> 32:59.521
I'm ready to get out!

33:03.025 --> 33:04.193
What's that?

33:04.693 --> 33:05.819
I'm ready to get out.

33:06.695 --> 33:08.906
Just get out. Here.

33:10.908 --> 33:11.909
It's cold.

33:13.160 --> 33:15.954
At DuBois and Guidry,
we've been working to get you your money--

33:16.038 --> 33:17.623
All right.

33:18.123 --> 33:19.249
Go to sleep.

33:20.751 --> 33:21.752
Palmer.

33:24.588 --> 33:25.589
Yeah?

33:26.715 --> 33:29.134
Do you know when my mama's coming back?

33:30.594 --> 33:31.803
Nah, I wish I did.

33:33.889 --> 33:37.601
I sometimes get mad
at my mama for leaving.

33:38.143 --> 33:39.978
Do you ever get mad at yours?

33:42.814 --> 33:44.191
I barely knew the woman.

33:45.359 --> 33:46.860
But you knew your daddy.

33:47.277 --> 33:48.278
That's right.

33:49.530 --> 33:50.739
Do you miss him?

33:51.949 --> 33:52.950
Yeah.

33:53.575 --> 33:55.035
Yeah, sometimes I do.

33:55.118 --> 33:57.037
Miss Vivian missed him too.

33:58.539 --> 34:00.457
But now, she gets to see him.

34:05.254 --> 34:06.505
I'm sure she does.

34:07.965 --> 34:09.174
Go to sleep, Sam.

34:09.882 --> 34:12.344
Palmer? Good night.

34:14.638 --> 34:15.639
Good night.

35:42.267 --> 35:44.311
Hey. Get in.

35:54.947 --> 35:56.073
Hey, Palmer.

36:02.412 --> 36:03.747
My mama bought me this.

36:05.999 --> 36:07.626
She got it at a garage sale.

36:08.961 --> 36:12.381
She said it was a bargain
'cause she got it for 50 cents.

36:13.090 --> 36:15.634
And she said
there was this woman named Heifer,

36:15.717 --> 36:19.763
'cause that old heifer
tried to steal it out from my mama.

36:19.847 --> 36:21.390
But my mama wouldn't let her,

36:22.140 --> 36:26.436
'cause she knew princesses
were my favorite thing in the whole world.

36:39.241 --> 36:41.326
All right. You guys are doing a great job.

36:41.410 --> 36:43.453
Tell me, what else do you see
in the ocean?

36:43.537 --> 36:44.705
Jellyfish?

36:44.788 --> 36:46.874
Jellyfish. And what do we see, Thomas?

37:01.638 --> 37:03.182
-Palmer?
-All right.

37:03.265 --> 37:04.474
Really?

37:05.392 --> 37:07.603
Okay. Hold on. Stay right here.

37:07.686 --> 37:08.896
Hey, Eddie.

37:08.979 --> 37:10.606
-Hey, it's Lucille.
-Hey.

37:10.689 --> 37:13.400
-Yeah, we met at church with Tommy.
-Yeah, right. Right.

37:13.483 --> 37:15.694
Yeah, Tommy mentioned
you're working at the school.

37:16.653 --> 37:17.654
So...

37:18.655 --> 37:20.073
Emily just adores Sam,

37:20.157 --> 37:23.076
and so I was wondering if it'd be okay
for them to have a playdate.

37:23.160 --> 37:26.038
Sam said I had to ask you.
He said you were his daddy.

37:26.747 --> 37:27.789
Playdate?

37:27.873 --> 37:31.668
Yeah, they would come right now
over to our house so that they could play.

37:31.752 --> 37:32.878
It's called a playdate.

37:32.961 --> 37:38.091
And then you could just pick him up,
say, around 5:00.

37:39.218 --> 37:40.677
-Yeah, sure.
-Yeah?

37:40.761 --> 37:41.803
Hey, guys.

37:43.180 --> 37:45.182
-Told you.
-Let's do it.

38:02.241 --> 38:03.492
Look. He's early.

38:03.575 --> 38:06.078
Come in. Come on in.

38:06.828 --> 38:08.372
-Oh, Christ.
-What are you doing?

38:08.455 --> 38:09.665
Come on.

38:11.208 --> 38:13.669
I don't know. He's just sitting there.

38:13.752 --> 38:16.255
I'm not gonna bite. You can come in.

38:16.338 --> 38:17.923
-In--
-Yeah.

38:20.676 --> 38:22.344
I don't know what he's doing.

38:23.178 --> 38:24.555
To hell with it.

38:25.514 --> 38:26.515
Shit.

38:27.599 --> 38:28.809
Can I get you anything?

38:28.892 --> 38:30.435
-No, no, no. Yeah.
-You want anything? Okay.

38:30.519 --> 38:32.145
-Can I get your coat?
-No, I'm good.

38:32.229 --> 38:33.939
-Hey, Palmer.
-Hey, Sam.

38:34.022 --> 38:35.816
Is Coles still at work?

38:36.316 --> 38:38.151
Yeah. That's what he tells me.

38:39.361 --> 38:42.114
And look. It is teatime, see?

38:42.197 --> 38:44.116
Just make yourself comfortable right here.

38:44.199 --> 38:46.451
Actually, just-- You wanna sit--
This looks good.

38:46.535 --> 38:47.744
How many lumps do you want?

38:49.288 --> 38:51.456
She means sugar. Sugar.

38:51.540 --> 38:52.541
Two.

38:56.295 --> 38:58.088
Careful, Palmer. It's hot.

38:59.006 --> 39:01.717
-Sir. This is beautiful.
-Thanks.

39:04.344 --> 39:05.888
Pinkies, please.

39:05.971 --> 39:07.222
Pinkies up.

39:10.475 --> 39:12.644
Do you know they drink tea in England?

39:12.728 --> 39:13.729
Yes.

39:13.812 --> 39:17.065
It's so good.
What do you think, Mr. Palmer?

39:19.401 --> 39:20.736
Yes.

39:20.819 --> 39:21.945
Real good.

39:22.029 --> 39:24.990
I love it.
I think I'll have a little more.

39:25.073 --> 39:26.700
-Bye, Miss Lucille.
-Bye, Sam.

39:26.783 --> 39:28.202
-Take care.
-Bye.

39:28.285 --> 39:29.995
Tea parties are my favorite.

39:30.913 --> 39:33.540
So, is Emily your girlfriend?

39:34.249 --> 39:37.377
She says she wants to marry me
when we get older.

39:37.461 --> 39:39.213
That sounds like a good offer.

39:39.296 --> 39:42.132
-I'm not gonna marry her.
-You never know. Maybe you will.

39:43.091 --> 39:45.427
Nah. She's a bossy little thing.

39:46.220 --> 39:47.513
You don't say.

39:47.596 --> 39:49.806
Okay. Yeah, all right, Daryl.

39:49.890 --> 39:52.518
Yeah, I'll be there.
I can't wait to see him play.

39:53.435 --> 39:54.436
Jesus.

39:55.145 --> 39:57.773
Hey, you ever been to a football game?

39:57.856 --> 39:59.107
Football?

40:12.746 --> 40:14.373
See that guy right out there?
Number three.

40:14.456 --> 40:16.708
That's the quarterback.
That's what I used to play.

40:16.792 --> 40:19.711
-Cool. Did you have a number?
-I sure did, number nine.

40:19.795 --> 40:21.171
-Well, look who it is.
-Hey.

40:21.255 --> 40:22.965
-Hi, Mr. Coles.
-Hey, Sammy.

40:23.048 --> 40:25.384
Heard y'all had yourself
a little tea party the other day.

40:25.467 --> 40:26.468
Yeah.

40:26.552 --> 40:29.763
Yeah, well, don't worry.
I've had to go to a few myself.

40:29.847 --> 40:30.848
I bet.

40:30.931 --> 40:33.767
God dang it. Max, Morgan,
get off that fence!

40:33.851 --> 40:35.561
Duty calls. Y'all enjoy the game.

40:35.644 --> 40:36.728
-All right, bud.
-Hey!

40:36.812 --> 40:37.980
-You hungry?
-Yep.

40:38.063 --> 40:40.274
-Thanks.
-Thank you very much.

40:40.357 --> 40:41.567
Hey, Miss Maggie.

40:41.650 --> 40:44.528
Sam, what are you doing here?
Are you a Rebels fan now?

40:44.611 --> 40:48.991
Yep, that's the quarterback out there.
Palmer used to be him when he played.

40:49.074 --> 40:51.285
-Quarterback, huh?
-A long time ago.

40:51.368 --> 40:53.036
What can I get for you?

40:53.704 --> 40:54.830
I already know.

40:55.414 --> 40:56.498
-Cookies.
-Cookies.

40:56.582 --> 40:57.958
Cookies!

40:58.625 --> 41:00.460
-All right. It's on me, kiddo.
-Thanks.

41:00.544 --> 41:02.379
What else you got planned for the weekend?

41:02.462 --> 41:03.463
I don't know.

41:04.131 --> 41:06.633
Do you wanna come with me
to a bowling fundraiser tomorrow?

41:06.717 --> 41:09.553
-Sure. Can Palmer come too?
-No, no, no. Miss Maggie invited you.

41:09.636 --> 41:11.513
She don't care. Right, Miss Maggie?

41:11.597 --> 41:14.725
-Sure, you're more than welcome to join.
-I can't. I got things to do.

41:14.808 --> 41:18.020
No, you don't. You're lying.
You got nothing to do.

41:18.103 --> 41:19.730
Please, Palmer. Please.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.440
-I think someone wants you to come.
-You have to come.

41:21.523 --> 41:23.942
-Okay, all right. I'll go.
-Yes.

41:24.026 --> 41:27.738
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Riverside High,

41:27.821 --> 41:32.284
home of the Riverside Rebels
and the Honey Belles.

41:33.368 --> 41:34.369
Palmer!

41:35.120 --> 41:36.914
-What's up, Palmer?
-Hey, Sibs. How are ya?

41:36.997 --> 41:37.998
All right.

41:38.081 --> 41:40.042
Don't forget to buy your raffle tickets.

41:40.125 --> 41:43.670
Five dollars for the raffle tickets.
Five dollars. All the proceeds...

41:43.754 --> 41:45.339
All right, looks like we made it
just in time.

41:45.422 --> 41:48.091
Hey there, little fella.
Can I have one of those?

41:49.510 --> 41:50.511
Thank you.

41:50.594 --> 41:52.596
How the hell
did you get stuck babysitting?

41:54.890 --> 41:57.309
Hey, don't get mixed up with Shelly, man.

41:58.685 --> 42:01.813
Trust me on that. Keep your dick
as far away from that one as possible.

42:01.897 --> 42:03.398
She'll burn it right off.

42:05.192 --> 42:06.652
Good to have you home, man.

42:06.735 --> 42:09.154
-Cookie, cookie, cookie.
-Ned, Ned.

42:09.238 --> 42:11.281
-Leave the boy's cookies alone.
-It's a fumble!

42:11.365 --> 42:12.950
That's good, man.

42:13.700 --> 42:15.244
Great play.

42:16.161 --> 42:18.997
Look, see? Number ten.
That's my boy, Jake, right there.

42:19.081 --> 42:20.082
Yeah. I see him.

42:20.874 --> 42:22.417
How they doing this season anyway?

42:22.501 --> 42:24.253
Are you kidding me? They're 3-0.

42:24.336 --> 42:26.463
Won that last game by three touchdowns.

42:26.547 --> 42:28.882
It's the best offensive line
I've seen in years.

42:35.264 --> 42:36.265
Hey...

42:36.932 --> 42:38.851
you ever see that Wessler kid anymore?

42:39.935 --> 42:40.978
Why?

42:41.770 --> 42:44.982
I tried looking him and his old man up.
Couldn't find either of 'em.

42:46.316 --> 42:49.403
Man, you gotta let that shit go.

42:52.239 --> 42:54.783
What you should have done
is beat his son's ass too.

42:54.867 --> 42:56.034
Nah.

42:56.118 --> 42:59.621
Well, he was the one bragging
about all that money his daddy got.

42:59.705 --> 43:01.915
Mind, there wasn't even
hardly nothing in there.

43:03.792 --> 43:05.377
And you go away for what?

43:05.460 --> 43:07.671
Old man lived, right? He was fine.

43:07.754 --> 43:10.382
He was lucky you used
an aluminum bat instead of wood.

43:10.465 --> 43:11.884
Otherwise, he'd be dead.

43:15.053 --> 43:18.265
Hey, you did your time, Palmer.
You don't owe nobody shit.

43:19.474 --> 43:21.768
Unlike Coles.

43:22.686 --> 43:25.314
Left you standing there
with your dick in your hand.

43:25.397 --> 43:26.565
I ain't talking shit.

43:26.648 --> 43:28.817
If you gonna be mad at somebody,
it should be him.

43:30.527 --> 43:32.404
And there's the pass. Jake Reed...

43:32.487 --> 43:34.072
All right!

43:34.656 --> 43:37.910
What did I tell you?
Just like his goddamn daddy!

43:38.493 --> 43:40.454
Ladies and gentlemen, the Honey Belles!

43:40.537 --> 43:42.247
The Honey Belles.

43:46.793 --> 43:48.921
We are Riverside!

43:49.546 --> 43:51.256
We are Riverside!

43:53.050 --> 43:55.469
Now, go on. Get inside
and lock this door behind me.

43:55.552 --> 43:56.970
Where are you going?

43:57.054 --> 43:58.597
Don't worry about it. It's grown-up stuff.

43:59.348 --> 44:01.099
Why can't I come with you?

44:01.183 --> 44:02.476
Because I said so.

44:03.143 --> 44:07.064
My favorite part was the Honey Belles.
My mama was a Honey Belle.

44:07.981 --> 44:09.316
I'm sure she was.

44:09.900 --> 44:10.984
Now shut the door.

44:12.945 --> 44:13.946
Lock it.

44:21.912 --> 44:23.664
No, no, her name was Bubba-Jean...

44:24.706 --> 44:26.458
and she was from Havana, Alabama--

44:26.542 --> 44:29.628
-Hold on. Her name was Bubba-Jean?
-Here, kitty, kitty.

44:29.711 --> 44:31.004
So she was gonna come over,

44:31.088 --> 44:33.465
I was gonna give her
some of my grandmama's moonshine.

44:33.549 --> 44:36.218
-Hey, Sibs.
-Hey, Jake.

44:36.301 --> 44:37.636
-Hey!
-Hell of a catch.

44:37.719 --> 44:38.887
Great win, boys!

44:39.721 --> 44:41.390
Hey, Jake!

44:41.473 --> 44:44.893
-Tommy held the line right here. Yeah.
-Kick ass and take names, all right?

44:45.477 --> 44:47.271
-Jake!
-We're doing what we do.

44:47.354 --> 44:49.898
-Best game y'all ever played.
-Hey.

44:49.982 --> 44:52.943
Too big of a football star now
to say "hi" to your old man?

44:53.735 --> 44:56.029
Let's get out of here. He's drunk.

44:58.156 --> 45:01.201
I'm gonna go get a beer. Jake.

45:02.327 --> 45:04.246
Hey, Palmer. Look who it is.

45:04.329 --> 45:06.206
It's your boss man, Sibs.

45:07.332 --> 45:09.209
Hey, get me a beer over here!

45:09.293 --> 45:12.212
Hey, how's my boy Palmer
working out for you?

45:12.296 --> 45:13.630
He's being a good boy for you?

45:14.464 --> 45:16.300
He's doing just fine, Daryl.

45:17.217 --> 45:19.678
I'm sorry. Am I bothering you?

45:20.804 --> 45:22.514
I'm just trying to have a drink here...

45:23.640 --> 45:24.808
in peace.

45:24.892 --> 45:28.353
Yeah, well, if you're looking for peace,
I suggest you find another fucking bar.

45:28.437 --> 45:30.981
Where the hell is my beer?

45:33.233 --> 45:34.526
-I'll go.
-All right.

45:34.610 --> 45:37.529
Hey, Daryl. Come on. We got you a beer.

45:37.613 --> 45:40.449
-Come on. Let's play some pool.
-All right.

45:40.532 --> 45:42.701
-Yeah, let's play.
-Hey, let's play some pool.

45:42.784 --> 45:44.661
-All right.
-Coles, grab our shit.

45:48.415 --> 45:50.959
Good morning. Wake up.

45:52.753 --> 45:54.796
I can't wait to go bowling.

45:56.965 --> 45:59.760
-What are you doing with that?
-It's for you.

46:02.179 --> 46:03.222
Go get dressed.

46:31.041 --> 46:32.167
Yes!

46:42.761 --> 46:44.638
-Okay.
-All right!

46:44.721 --> 46:45.722
Pretty good.

46:46.348 --> 46:48.267
Oh, my gosh! Good job!

46:49.685 --> 46:51.353
Good job, Sammy!

46:51.436 --> 46:53.897
I like those dance moves, man.

46:56.400 --> 46:59.111
I'm done.
Can I have some money to play some games?

47:02.072 --> 47:03.073
Thank you.

47:04.283 --> 47:06.118
And we're leaving in ten minutes.

47:06.201 --> 47:07.202
Okay.

47:08.829 --> 47:10.497
Did you get one of these yet?

47:10.581 --> 47:13.000
Nope. One on the wall still works.

47:15.544 --> 47:18.589
So, quarterback at Riverside.

47:20.632 --> 47:21.967
Yeah, the glory days.

47:22.050 --> 47:23.886
And then I went on to LSU.

47:26.847 --> 47:28.682
What? What is that face?

47:29.474 --> 47:31.560
I'm a closeted Bulldogs fan.

47:32.102 --> 47:33.228
You went to Georgia?

47:33.312 --> 47:35.147
Go, Dawgs! Sic 'em!

47:35.230 --> 47:37.191
No, no. You can't say that around here.

47:37.274 --> 47:40.402
You're the first person I told,
so if you tell anyone, I will deny it.

47:40.485 --> 47:41.778
Your secret is safe with me.

47:41.862 --> 47:43.197
Thank you.

47:44.615 --> 47:47.618
I only went to LSU
for about a year, and then...

47:49.870 --> 47:52.080
then got sort of a different education.

47:55.459 --> 47:57.294
Yeah, I did hear about that.

47:58.629 --> 47:59.838
People like to talk.

48:00.464 --> 48:01.590
Don't I know.

48:03.550 --> 48:06.595
And now to be back here, it's a...

48:08.055 --> 48:10.349
Yes! Another jackpot!

48:10.432 --> 48:12.184
So, how'd you end up here?

48:15.270 --> 48:17.814
I was in a different institution.

48:19.399 --> 48:20.609
Marriage.

48:21.735 --> 48:24.071
Yeah, I was married and living in Atlanta.

48:24.947 --> 48:28.283
He and I met in college.
Tied the knot right after.

48:29.409 --> 48:30.827
Things didn't work out.

48:30.911 --> 48:33.539
Once the divorce was final,
I wanted to be closer to my family.

48:33.622 --> 48:35.207
And I got a cousin here in Sylvain, so...

48:36.583 --> 48:37.584
I moved.

48:39.586 --> 48:42.339
You know, sometimes, yeah,
it can be a little too...

48:43.715 --> 48:45.008
country.

49:16.748 --> 49:18.458
Trash bins need to be washed out.

49:18.542 --> 49:20.961
Take 'em round back.
There's a hose. Wipe 'em down.

49:21.503 --> 49:22.504
Yes, sir.

49:26.216 --> 49:29.469
Hey, Daryl was an asshole in high school.

49:30.053 --> 49:31.263
Not much has changed.

49:31.763 --> 49:34.433
Personally,
I don't spend time with assholes.

49:35.642 --> 49:36.643
Yes, sir.

49:43.400 --> 49:44.568
Sam.

49:44.651 --> 49:47.070
-Come talk with me for a moment.
-Okay.

49:57.456 --> 50:00.292
I saw that Mr. Palmer
gave you a ride to school this morning.

50:01.084 --> 50:03.170
-Does he always do that?
-Yes, sir.

50:03.962 --> 50:06.465
And he lives right next door to you.
Is that right?

50:06.548 --> 50:09.259
His house is right beside
my mama's trailer.

50:11.136 --> 50:12.638
And he's always nice to you?

50:13.222 --> 50:14.515
Yes, sir.

50:14.598 --> 50:15.974
And everything's okay?

50:22.105 --> 50:26.068
Sam, if everything weren't okay,
you could tell me, no matter what it is.

50:29.029 --> 50:31.198
It's okay, son. Go on.

50:33.992 --> 50:37.412
Your breath smells kinda funny.

50:41.166 --> 50:43.001
Okay. Well, carry on.

50:49.466 --> 50:50.592
Rinse.

50:52.553 --> 50:54.555
Come on. Get dressed. Can't be late.

51:03.522 --> 51:04.940
I'll see you in a couple weeks.

51:06.191 --> 51:07.317
Good luck to you.

51:13.156 --> 51:14.157
Bye.

51:14.867 --> 51:16.577
You like root beer floats?

51:17.244 --> 51:19.329
I don't know. Never had one.

51:20.038 --> 51:22.457
What? Never had one?

51:23.333 --> 51:24.334
Come on, man.

51:26.962 --> 51:28.213
Well?

51:29.339 --> 51:30.883
Heaven in a cup.

51:34.636 --> 51:37.222
Why did you have to go see
that man anyways?

51:40.350 --> 51:43.520
'Cause I did something bad,
and he's gotta check up on me

51:43.604 --> 51:45.105
to make sure I'm doing good now.

51:45.731 --> 51:46.857
Well, what'd you do?

51:49.735 --> 51:52.196
I wasn't a nice person.

51:52.988 --> 51:54.406
I hurt somebody.

51:55.240 --> 51:58.493
And I stole money and a whole lot
of other things that didn't belong to me.

51:59.244 --> 52:03.248
My mama stole money once,
but she never had to go see that man.

52:05.250 --> 52:08.212
Some people get caught, and some don't.
I got caught.

52:10.130 --> 52:12.966
My mom said she had to steal
'cause we were poor.

52:13.592 --> 52:15.594
Lots of people are poor. They don't steal.

52:15.677 --> 52:16.720
You did.

52:18.555 --> 52:21.725
That's right, I did. And I wish I hadn't.

52:24.102 --> 52:25.312
I stole too.

52:26.230 --> 52:27.272
You did, huh?

52:29.316 --> 52:31.527
You think that person
misses what you took?

52:32.486 --> 52:35.197
I know she does. She cried in class.

52:35.781 --> 52:39.409
Miss Maggie asked if anyone had seen it,
and I said no.

52:40.827 --> 52:41.954
So you lied too.

52:45.290 --> 52:48.877
You think that little girl would feel
better if she got back what you stole?

52:50.003 --> 52:53.423
Yeah. I think I'd feel better too.

52:53.966 --> 52:55.384
I bet she'd appreciate it.

53:02.850 --> 53:06.854
I stole from Miss Vivian too,
but I can't give it back.

53:06.937 --> 53:08.146
You did, huh?

53:10.399 --> 53:11.567
I was hungry.

53:13.652 --> 53:14.736
It's all right.

53:16.321 --> 53:19.867
But I bet if you'd asked Miss Vivian
for anything in the world,

53:19.950 --> 53:21.368
she'd have helped you out.

53:21.451 --> 53:22.578
What do you think?

53:23.412 --> 53:26.206
Yeah, think she would've.

53:27.666 --> 53:28.667
Me too.

53:32.588 --> 53:35.424
You ain't gonna go all psycho on me
after all that sugar, are you?

53:37.593 --> 53:39.553
All right, tucked in there.

53:40.971 --> 53:43.891
This is way more comfier than the couch.

53:43.974 --> 53:45.809
Well, that's 'cause it's a bed.

53:48.353 --> 53:49.354
Palmer?

53:51.523 --> 53:52.524
Yeah?

53:54.860 --> 53:55.861
Nothing.

53:57.446 --> 53:58.447
Good night, Sam.

53:59.573 --> 54:00.574
Night.

54:49.748 --> 54:52.543
You think maybe we ought to put
something else in there today?

54:53.168 --> 54:54.169
Okay.

54:54.253 --> 54:56.338
Grab that loaf of bread and a plastic bag.

55:00.133 --> 55:01.510
Throw it on the table.

55:04.179 --> 55:05.180
Sit down.

55:07.432 --> 55:08.642
All right.

55:08.725 --> 55:11.228
Now, not many people know this.

55:11.979 --> 55:12.980
When I was your age,

55:13.063 --> 55:16.567
I won the state sandwich-making contest
three years in a row.

55:17.734 --> 55:19.987
There's no state sandwich contest.

55:20.070 --> 55:21.905
There ain't? Then how'd I win?

55:23.073 --> 55:26.660
Now, the secret is you gotta spread
the mustard evenly

55:26.743 --> 55:28.328
on both slices of bread.

55:28.412 --> 55:29.705
Judges love that.

55:30.789 --> 55:31.874
You're fibbing.

55:36.837 --> 55:38.046
Are you calling me a liar?

55:40.591 --> 55:42.009
A matter of fact, I am.

55:43.927 --> 55:45.053
Yeah, I am.

55:46.680 --> 55:48.515
Look, just do me a favor, okay?

55:49.683 --> 55:52.769
You can have the cookies,
but will you just eat this before?

55:53.228 --> 55:54.521
Okay.

55:55.105 --> 55:56.773
Attakid. Let's do it.

55:58.275 --> 55:59.359
Morning, Sam.

55:59.443 --> 56:00.736
Hey, Mr. Sibs.

56:01.528 --> 56:02.779
Early, huh?

56:02.863 --> 56:04.239
Early bird gets the worm.

56:32.476 --> 56:34.853
...dear Sam

56:34.937 --> 56:38.649
Happy birthday to you

56:38.732 --> 56:39.816
There you go.

56:40.984 --> 56:42.694
One left. One left!

56:42.778 --> 56:44.321
Blow it.

56:44.404 --> 56:45.405
There you go.

56:48.158 --> 56:49.368
I hope you like it.

56:50.786 --> 56:53.038
A guitar! But I don't know how to play it.

56:54.248 --> 56:58.210
It's actually called a ukulele,
and I'll show you how to play it.

56:58.293 --> 56:59.294
Here.

57:00.295 --> 57:01.296
There you go.

57:01.380 --> 57:02.381
So here's your notes.

57:02.464 --> 57:05.217
G, C, E, A.

57:06.301 --> 57:07.636
And what you want to say is

57:07.719 --> 57:11.390
My dog has fleas

57:11.473 --> 57:13.809
-What do you think about that?
-Cool.

57:13.892 --> 57:14.893
Try it.

57:15.811 --> 57:19.106
My dog has fleas

57:19.189 --> 57:20.899
-Wow!
-That's pretty good.

57:20.983 --> 57:23.402
-Thanks.
-My dog really does have fleas.

57:24.862 --> 57:26.113
Good to know.

57:26.196 --> 57:28.365
Try it again.
See if y'all can do it together.

57:28.448 --> 57:30.784
My dog has fleas

57:30.868 --> 57:32.870
My dog has fleas

57:33.704 --> 57:34.913
My dog has fleas

57:34.997 --> 57:36.957
-That was a mistake.
-Oh, yeah.

57:39.042 --> 57:40.043
Is this you?

57:42.004 --> 57:44.798
-Yeah.
-Look at how cute you were.

57:45.340 --> 57:46.466
All right.

57:48.010 --> 57:49.553
Did Vivian raise you alone?

57:51.221 --> 57:53.932
My dad passed away
when I was in high school.

57:54.016 --> 57:55.225
She took care of me.

57:55.976 --> 57:57.144
And your mother?

57:57.769 --> 57:59.563
Ran off when I was about five.

58:01.023 --> 58:02.816
Vivian was more like a mother to me.

58:08.614 --> 58:10.032
It's a lot of mail you got here.

58:11.283 --> 58:12.284
Yeah, I know.

58:13.452 --> 58:15.078
You know you gotta open it, right?

58:15.162 --> 58:18.081
Why? Can't be anything good in there.

58:18.165 --> 58:21.460
If you want,
I can help you sort through some of it.

58:21.543 --> 58:22.544
Nah, you don't have to do that.

58:22.628 --> 58:26.507
I know I don't have to.
There might be some cool coupons in there.

58:28.091 --> 58:29.343
Jesus.

58:29.426 --> 58:31.970
Hey, be careful with that.

58:34.723 --> 58:38.310
All right, this one is for $12.61.

58:38.393 --> 58:39.394
Okay.

58:41.230 --> 58:44.149
There's 13 even,
and you can keep the change.

58:44.233 --> 58:45.484
Thank you.

58:47.444 --> 58:49.655
-Do you wanna do the lawyer next?
-Yeah. Yeah.

58:50.322 --> 58:51.365
All right.

58:53.450 --> 58:54.451
What's it say?

58:57.538 --> 58:58.789
It's about Vivian's will.

58:58.872 --> 59:02.084
The lawyer just wants you to call him
as soon as you can.

59:02.167 --> 59:03.210
That's it?

59:06.255 --> 59:07.422
Okay.

59:07.506 --> 59:11.260
This Eddie Palmer?
Were you aware of Vivian's will?

59:11.343 --> 59:12.594
No, I'm not.

59:13.512 --> 59:15.430
Well,
according to your grandmother's will,

59:15.514 --> 59:17.641
her house and land
are to be put up for sale,

59:17.724 --> 59:21.311
and the money is gonna be donated
to the Saints of Christ Church.

59:21.395 --> 59:25.148
But she also left instructions
that you'll receive $5,000.

59:25.232 --> 59:26.483
Hold on. She--

59:27.442 --> 59:29.444
She's giving the house to the church?

59:30.529 --> 59:31.738
These are her wishes?

59:32.531 --> 59:34.157
I'm afraid so.

59:34.241 --> 59:36.201
Do you have any other questions?

59:37.828 --> 59:40.038
When do I gotta move out?

59:40.122 --> 59:41.915
Well, once the house sells,

59:41.999 --> 59:44.543
you'll have 30 days
to vacate the premises.

59:47.504 --> 59:51.049
'Kay, ready? Snap to the right.

59:51.800 --> 59:53.260
Turn to the left.

59:53.343 --> 59:56.096
-Go like that. Not like...
-This?

59:56.180 --> 59:58.307
Okay? So get like-- Yeah.

59:58.390 --> 1:00:01.018
Hey, Sam. Why do you act like a girl?

1:00:02.978 --> 1:00:04.104
I-- I don't know.

1:00:04.646 --> 1:00:06.690
I know why. 'Cause he's a faggot.

1:00:08.317 --> 1:00:10.152
Stop, Toby.

1:00:11.111 --> 1:00:14.031
He's probably going
as a fairy for Halloween.

1:00:17.075 --> 1:00:18.410
What you gonna do about it?

1:00:18.869 --> 1:00:19.870
Nothing.

1:00:23.290 --> 1:00:24.499
Go on to class, Sam.

1:00:26.835 --> 1:00:28.003
Y'all get outta here.

1:00:33.300 --> 1:00:36.303
You touch that boy again,
I'm gonna break your arm.

1:00:36.929 --> 1:00:37.930
Got it?

1:00:38.972 --> 1:00:39.973
Go.

1:00:49.775 --> 1:00:54.655
And remember, if you wanna be a member
of Penelope's Flying Princess Club,

1:00:54.738 --> 1:00:57.366
all you have to do is write us a letter.

1:00:57.449 --> 1:01:00.118
We'll even mail you a certificate.

1:01:00.202 --> 1:01:01.703
I love new members.

1:01:01.787 --> 1:01:04.748
Penelope the Princess said
if you write their show a letter,

1:01:04.831 --> 1:01:06.917
you can join their club.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.169
They even give you a certificate.

1:01:09.253 --> 1:01:11.088
Okay, everybody fly back.

1:01:11.171 --> 1:01:12.589
Can you write me one?

1:01:13.257 --> 1:01:14.258
Look.

1:01:14.341 --> 1:01:17.469
There's things in this world you can be,
and there's things that you can't.

1:01:17.553 --> 1:01:19.847
-...ready for adventure.
-Okay?

1:01:20.389 --> 1:01:22.724
How many boys do you see on that show?

1:01:23.809 --> 1:01:26.311
-None.
-And what does that tell you?

1:01:27.354 --> 1:01:29.439
-That I can be the first.
-Here goes.

1:01:30.607 --> 1:01:33.569
Sparkles! Hello, Sparkles.

1:01:33.652 --> 1:01:36.154
Gemma, Lilly, come on.

1:01:36.655 --> 1:01:38.657
Look! They have it.

1:01:39.324 --> 1:01:40.492
Can I get it?

1:01:41.285 --> 1:01:44.621
What about being Peter the Prince
or, I don't know, a pirate?

1:01:44.705 --> 1:01:47.833
I don't wanna be a pirate.
I wanna be Penelope the Princess.

1:01:47.916 --> 1:01:50.210
You can't be a princess,
so pick something else.

1:01:50.294 --> 1:01:52.754
Why? Emily is going as a princess.

1:01:52.838 --> 1:01:55.382
-Emily is a girl.
-So?

1:01:57.968 --> 1:01:59.887
Come here. Look at me.

1:02:01.597 --> 1:02:05.642
Some costumes are made for girls,
and some are made for boys.

1:02:05.726 --> 1:02:09.313
Now, it don't mean you can't wear it.
You can.

1:02:09.396 --> 1:02:11.231
But kids are mean.

1:02:11.315 --> 1:02:14.818
Especially when they see something
that they ain't used to seeing.

1:02:14.902 --> 1:02:18.780
They just expect to see
a girl wearing this costume.

1:02:19.489 --> 1:02:21.366
Like your friend Emily.

1:02:22.284 --> 1:02:24.411
They should make one for boys.

1:02:24.494 --> 1:02:25.495
They do.

1:02:27.122 --> 1:02:28.457
It's Peter the Prince.

1:02:33.587 --> 1:02:35.172
You ready for Halloween?

1:02:35.255 --> 1:02:36.465
Yep. I can't wait.

1:02:36.882 --> 1:02:39.009
You have yourself a good time.

1:02:39.092 --> 1:02:41.553
Eddie Palmer. Hello, Sam.

1:02:42.095 --> 1:02:43.972
You still looking after this boy?

1:02:44.056 --> 1:02:46.850
You got no right looking after any child.

1:02:46.934 --> 1:02:48.644
You ain't nothing but a criminal.

1:02:48.727 --> 1:02:49.811
Come on, Sam.

1:02:50.479 --> 1:02:51.522
You know what?

1:02:51.605 --> 1:02:54.650
Palmer's been seeing that man,
and he's been doing good.

1:02:54.733 --> 1:02:57.152
So you can mind your own ass.

1:02:57.236 --> 1:02:58.403
Come on.

1:02:58.487 --> 1:03:00.781
I am calling child services.

1:03:00.864 --> 1:03:02.115
Hey, Sam?

1:03:04.201 --> 1:03:05.536
I'm doing good, huh?

1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:09.581
Real good.

1:03:12.334 --> 1:03:13.335
Come on.

1:03:14.378 --> 1:03:17.923
I can't wait to see what everyone's
gonna be for Halloween tomorrow.

1:03:18.006 --> 1:03:19.842
Group three, you can get your backpacks.

1:03:20.425 --> 1:03:21.426
Bye, sweetie.

1:03:21.718 --> 1:03:25.597
Hey, Sam. Do you have
a Halloween costume for tomorrow?

1:03:25.681 --> 1:03:29.309
Uh-huh. Penelope the Flying Princess.
Palmer got it for me.

1:03:29.935 --> 1:03:33.772
Penelope? That's exciting.
Okay, I can't wait to see it.

1:03:33.856 --> 1:03:35.524
-Goodbye, Miss Maggie.
-Bye.

1:03:44.867 --> 1:03:46.076
Quite an outfit.

1:03:46.702 --> 1:03:48.745
I can't get it to stay on my head.

1:03:49.955 --> 1:03:50.956
Come here.

1:04:03.468 --> 1:04:05.846
There you go. I hope that works.

1:04:06.555 --> 1:04:08.974
Me too. Thanks.

1:04:09.474 --> 1:04:10.517
You're welcome, kiddo.

1:04:13.520 --> 1:04:16.356
Let me guess. Pink or purple.
You can't decide.

1:04:18.066 --> 1:04:20.611
I'm the flying princess cowboy.

1:04:20.694 --> 1:04:22.613
Let's ride. Giddy-giddy.

1:04:22.696 --> 1:04:25.866
Samantha is wearing a girl's costume.

1:04:25.949 --> 1:04:28.368
She's probably wearing panties.

1:04:36.251 --> 1:04:38.253
Excuse me, class.

1:04:39.254 --> 1:04:42.466
Does anybody know where Miss Maggie is?

1:04:42.549 --> 1:04:44.218
-You're right there!
-No.

1:04:44.301 --> 1:04:46.887
No, I'm not. I'm Principal Forbes.

1:04:46.970 --> 1:04:49.181
And that's a fake mustache!

1:04:49.848 --> 1:04:53.560
It's a real mustache.
I grew it this morning.

1:04:53.644 --> 1:04:55.020
No!

1:04:55.103 --> 1:04:57.105
Miss Maggie must be playing hooky,

1:04:57.189 --> 1:05:00.567
'cause today Principal Forbes
is taking care of your classroom.

1:05:00.651 --> 1:05:03.737
-No.
-Yes, I am. You see,

1:05:03.820 --> 1:05:08.325
that is the entire point of Halloween
or any other day of the year.

1:05:08.408 --> 1:05:11.161
You can just be whoever you wanna be.

1:05:12.996 --> 1:05:14.164
I'm a cowboy!

1:05:14.248 --> 1:05:15.374
Is that an astronaut?

1:05:15.457 --> 1:05:16.792
And we got a witch.

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:18.168
And is that--

1:05:18.794 --> 1:05:22.381
That looks like a flying princess.
Yes, it does.

1:05:22.881 --> 1:05:24.091
And another one.

1:05:24.675 --> 1:05:25.801
And another one.

1:05:25.884 --> 1:05:29.221
How wonderful does everybody look today?

1:05:31.098 --> 1:05:34.434
-Trick or treat!
-I've got some treats.

1:05:34.518 --> 1:05:36.228
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

1:05:36.311 --> 1:05:37.771
These are my favorite.

1:05:38.814 --> 1:05:41.149
-Wow. Nice place you got.
-Thank you.

1:05:41.233 --> 1:05:42.985
Who are you for Halloween?

1:05:43.068 --> 1:05:44.486
-Me?
-Yeah.

1:05:44.570 --> 1:05:45.737
I was a janitor.

1:05:46.655 --> 1:05:48.240
You want to give me a hand?

1:05:48.323 --> 1:05:49.825
That's enough candy, Sam.

1:05:55.163 --> 1:05:57.040
-That was so good.
-Good, good.

1:05:57.124 --> 1:05:59.793
-How's he doing?
-He's watching TV in there.

1:06:00.252 --> 1:06:01.461
Boy loves TV.

1:06:02.087 --> 1:06:03.630
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1:06:05.048 --> 1:06:08.051
It turned out to be
a really good day at school today.

1:06:08.135 --> 1:06:09.178
That's good.

1:06:09.678 --> 1:06:11.597
I think he really had fun.

1:06:16.393 --> 1:06:18.145
And I'm glad you guys
stopped by for dinner.

1:06:19.229 --> 1:06:20.480
Me too.

1:06:22.191 --> 1:06:23.609
So, I gotta ask you something.

1:06:26.820 --> 1:06:27.821
Okay.

1:06:30.199 --> 1:06:31.992
How did you end up in prison?

1:06:35.579 --> 1:06:37.122
That's a longer story.

1:06:37.206 --> 1:06:38.957
I don't know. I don't get it.

1:06:40.167 --> 1:06:41.752
It's a fair question.

1:06:52.596 --> 1:06:55.807
Things were going okay at LSU.

1:06:57.643 --> 1:07:01.980
Until one game, I get hit so hard,
I can't even tell you my name.

1:07:04.691 --> 1:07:09.238
Couple surgeries,
and that was the end of football

1:07:09.738 --> 1:07:10.906
and school.

1:07:12.658 --> 1:07:16.745
Came back home. Started taking pills.

1:07:19.414 --> 1:07:20.624
Doing other things.

1:07:23.168 --> 1:07:24.670
I'd end up in jail for a night...

1:07:26.129 --> 1:07:27.881
swear I wouldn't do it again.

1:07:31.385 --> 1:07:32.678
There was this rich kid.

1:07:33.428 --> 1:07:34.805
He was always going on and on,

1:07:34.888 --> 1:07:38.058
bragging about how much money
his dad kept in the safe at the house.

1:07:39.184 --> 1:07:42.855
One night, me and the guys, we broke in.

1:07:43.772 --> 1:07:45.524
Nobody was supposed to be there.

1:07:46.358 --> 1:07:47.985
His old man comes home.

1:07:49.152 --> 1:07:50.279
Had a gun.

1:07:56.910 --> 1:07:58.537
I nearly beat him to death.

1:08:03.834 --> 1:08:06.128
And the next thing I know, I'm in prison.

1:08:09.590 --> 1:08:11.133
You weren't alone?

1:08:11.675 --> 1:08:14.303
Don't matter. I did what I did.

1:08:17.598 --> 1:08:18.765
Yeah.

1:08:20.642 --> 1:08:22.185
But look at what you did today.

1:08:49.212 --> 1:08:50.214
He's out.

1:08:54.301 --> 1:08:55.301
Are you tired?

1:08:58.764 --> 1:08:59.765
No.

1:10:10.794 --> 1:10:13.338
I swear that boy will sleep
through a freight train.

1:10:20.345 --> 1:10:21.346
This was fun.

1:10:26.059 --> 1:10:27.728
-All right.
-All right.

1:10:29.104 --> 1:10:30.606
I guess I'll see you at school.

1:10:34.109 --> 1:10:36.069
-Good night.
-Good night.

1:10:38.780 --> 1:10:39.907
Still looking.

1:10:45.954 --> 1:10:48.999
All right, guys.
I'll give you a few more minutes.

1:10:49.082 --> 1:10:51.043
And it's okay if you make a mistake.

1:10:51.126 --> 1:10:53.253
Sam, do you wanna have another tea party?

1:10:53.337 --> 1:10:54.463
Can we play dress-up?

1:10:54.922 --> 1:10:56.048
Of course.

1:10:56.131 --> 1:10:57.799
-I'm in.
-Yeah.

1:10:59.801 --> 1:11:02.387
What are we going to do, huh? Hey, Eddie.

1:11:02.471 --> 1:11:04.223
Hey, they are so excited.

1:11:04.306 --> 1:11:08.143
Listen, listen. Don't even rush yourself.
Just come whenever you're ready, okay?

1:11:08.227 --> 1:11:10.979
And Daryl's stopping by too.
We can all have a beer.

1:11:11.063 --> 1:11:13.732
-Say hello to Tommy.
-I will. We're gonna have fun.

1:11:13.815 --> 1:11:15.984
-See you later, Palmer.
-See ya, bud.

1:11:59.611 --> 1:12:00.737
May I help you?

1:12:02.114 --> 1:12:03.949
How's that air conditioner working out?

1:12:07.536 --> 1:12:08.954
You're gonna get me in trouble.

1:12:09.997 --> 1:12:10.998
Am I?

1:12:16.253 --> 1:12:19.464
-I gotta go.
-No, you don't.

1:12:19.548 --> 1:12:21.717
Yes. Yes, I do.

1:12:26.513 --> 1:12:27.681
Hey.

1:12:28.724 --> 1:12:29.725
Hey.

1:12:31.059 --> 1:12:32.436
Will you help me with something?

1:12:33.687 --> 1:12:35.397
-Yeah.
-Come here.

1:12:39.776 --> 1:12:42.404
I don't know. All this stuff.

1:12:43.488 --> 1:12:45.240
Do you know anybody who could use it?

1:12:46.617 --> 1:12:48.702
I think my grandmother
would've loved that.

1:12:52.414 --> 1:12:53.624
Yeah, I'm sure I do.

1:12:59.713 --> 1:13:00.797
Sam!

1:13:02.090 --> 1:13:04.551
-Hey, bud.
-What happened to you?

1:13:06.470 --> 1:13:08.472
-Eddie, I am so--
-What the hell is going on?

1:13:08.555 --> 1:13:11.225
I don't even know. I left him for a bit.
They were playing dress-up.

1:13:11.308 --> 1:13:14.728
When I came back, he had makeup smeared
all over his face and he was crying.

1:13:14.811 --> 1:13:16.772
I don't even know what happened.
I'm sorry.

1:13:16.855 --> 1:13:18.607
It's okay. It's okay, sweetie.

1:13:18.690 --> 1:13:20.484
Hey, buddy. Hey.

1:13:20.567 --> 1:13:22.653
You wanna tell me and Miss Maggie
what happened?

1:13:24.613 --> 1:13:25.864
Hey. It's all right.

1:13:26.949 --> 1:13:29.785
Was it the same ones that pick on you?
Were they over there?

1:13:32.079 --> 1:13:33.413
Listen to me, son.

1:13:33.497 --> 1:13:36.917
I know you don't wanna hear this,
but sometimes you gotta hit 'em back.

1:13:37.626 --> 1:13:38.752
Eddie.

1:13:39.253 --> 1:13:40.504
They were bigger than me.

1:13:40.587 --> 1:13:43.048
I know, son, but if you don't stand up
for yourself now,

1:13:43.131 --> 1:13:45.008
those kids are never
gonna leave you alone.

1:13:45.092 --> 1:13:46.093
Eddie.

1:13:46.176 --> 1:13:48.387
They weren't kids.

1:13:49.513 --> 1:13:51.390
What do you mean?

1:13:51.849 --> 1:13:54.685
Okay, look at me, okay?
Who did this to you, Sam?

1:13:55.853 --> 1:13:57.145
It's okay. You can tell us.

1:13:59.690 --> 1:14:01.316
Toby's dad.

1:14:02.234 --> 1:14:03.277
What?

1:14:03.944 --> 1:14:08.782
Toby's dad. Your friend, Daryl, he did it.

1:14:12.744 --> 1:14:13.745
Hey, Eddie.

1:14:16.123 --> 1:14:17.124
Hey, Eddie.

1:14:18.000 --> 1:14:20.502
Eddie. Hey, Eddie! Where are you going?

1:14:21.003 --> 1:14:22.337
Eddie, don't do--

1:14:37.603 --> 1:14:41.356
Hey, look. He was already wearing a dress.
I just gave the little faggot some--

1:14:42.107 --> 1:14:44.026
Palmer, no! What are you doing?

1:14:44.109 --> 1:14:45.152
Stop!

1:14:46.153 --> 1:14:47.654
-Eddie!
-Palmer!

1:14:47.738 --> 1:14:49.615
-Palmer!
-Eddie! Hey!

1:14:49.698 --> 1:14:51.867
-Get off me!
-Eddie, Eddie.

1:14:51.950 --> 1:14:53.785
What the hell you doing? My--

1:14:53.869 --> 1:14:55.996
-Simmer down, man!
-Palmer. Palmer--

1:14:56.580 --> 1:14:58.332
Funny to you too, Coles, huh?

1:14:58.415 --> 1:15:01.752
Seeing a grown man hold a little boy down,
make him cry while he put makeup on him?

1:15:01.835 --> 1:15:04.213
-I was not-- I wasn't there--
-The fuck you weren't!

1:15:04.296 --> 1:15:06.673
-It was at your fucking house.
-I wasn't there.

1:15:08.383 --> 1:15:09.968
Let's get one thing straight.

1:15:10.928 --> 1:15:15.516
Your daddy comes to see me,
you ain't walkin' away this time.

1:15:16.850 --> 1:15:18.268
Believe me on that.

1:15:19.895 --> 1:15:21.313
Twelve fucking years!

1:15:33.116 --> 1:15:34.743
What's everybody lookin' at? Show's over.

1:15:34.826 --> 1:15:36.370
-Fuck.
-Come on. Let's go.

1:15:36.453 --> 1:15:37.955
-Get up.
-Oh, my God, Daryl.

1:15:38.038 --> 1:15:39.206
Come on.

1:15:40.249 --> 1:15:42.876
-Is he okay?
-Jesus H. Christ.

1:15:53.637 --> 1:15:54.805
What are you gonna do?

1:15:56.181 --> 1:15:57.724
Beat up everyone that picks on him?

1:15:58.642 --> 1:16:00.686
No, just the ones over 30.

1:16:00.769 --> 1:16:03.522
There are other ways to handle things.

1:16:06.108 --> 1:16:09.152
-Are you gonna get in trouble?
-Daryl ain't gonna press charges.

1:16:10.153 --> 1:16:11.196
Lucky you.

1:16:14.199 --> 1:16:15.701
Sam cried himself to sleep...

1:16:16.618 --> 1:16:17.828
asking for you.

1:16:27.629 --> 1:16:28.839
Hey, I--

1:16:54.239 --> 1:16:55.365
I got you this.

1:17:06.168 --> 1:17:08.170
Sam. Listen to me.

1:17:09.588 --> 1:17:12.257
What Daryl did to you was wrong.

1:17:13.550 --> 1:17:14.676
You know that, right?

1:17:15.844 --> 1:17:17.638
You didn't do anything bad.

1:17:18.764 --> 1:17:19.806
You understand me?

1:17:20.349 --> 1:17:22.518
-Okay.
-Not a thing.

1:17:23.977 --> 1:17:25.020
You hear me, son?

1:17:25.812 --> 1:17:26.813
Yeah.

1:17:27.564 --> 1:17:28.565
Okay.

1:17:29.650 --> 1:17:32.236
Hey. I got an idea.

1:17:32.945 --> 1:17:33.946
Come on.

1:17:35.364 --> 1:17:37.783
All right. Here's what we got so far.

1:17:38.659 --> 1:17:41.161
"Dear Penelope's Flying Princess Club"--

1:17:41.828 --> 1:17:43.914
-Did I get that right?
-Yeah.

1:17:43.997 --> 1:17:47.793
"My name is Sam, and I would very much
like to be a member."

1:17:48.460 --> 1:17:52.130
Make sure you tell them how much I love
their show, and I watch it every day.

1:17:52.214 --> 1:17:57.427
"I watch your show, and...

1:17:59.137 --> 1:18:01.014
I love it

1:18:01.098 --> 1:18:06.311
more than anything in the world."

1:18:07.771 --> 1:18:08.772
All right.

1:18:08.856 --> 1:18:10.858
All you gotta do
is sign your name right there.

1:18:16.822 --> 1:18:18.448
Should be good to go.

1:18:32.254 --> 1:18:33.463
Hey, Sammy.

1:18:35.966 --> 1:18:37.759
Hi, baby.

1:18:40.596 --> 1:18:43.307
Aren't you gonna come give
your mama a hug? Come on.

1:18:43.849 --> 1:18:44.933
Hey, Mama.

1:18:47.311 --> 1:18:50.147
Oh, boy. I missed you so much.

1:18:51.481 --> 1:18:54.526
Look at you. Hi.

1:18:54.610 --> 1:18:57.070
-You okay?
-Yeah.

1:18:57.154 --> 1:18:58.405
Yeah, I'm good.

1:19:01.491 --> 1:19:03.285
I heard about Miss Vivian.

1:19:04.203 --> 1:19:05.746
I'm sorry about that.

1:19:07.915 --> 1:19:09.750
She was a good woman. I liked her.

1:19:12.753 --> 1:19:15.172
Sammy, I think it's time for us
to go home, baby.

1:19:15.255 --> 1:19:16.673
You wanna go get your stuff?

1:19:17.466 --> 1:19:19.593
-Back home?
-Yeah.

1:19:26.016 --> 1:19:28.393
-Don't forget this.
-I won't.

1:19:30.896 --> 1:19:31.939
Hey.

1:19:32.981 --> 1:19:34.149
We had a good time.

1:19:35.150 --> 1:19:38.737
And you can come and visit me
whenever you like.

1:19:48.872 --> 1:19:49.873
All right.

1:19:50.707 --> 1:19:52.626
I'll go get the rest of your stuff.

1:19:52.709 --> 1:19:53.836
Thanks, Palmer.

1:19:55.504 --> 1:19:56.588
Where'd you get that?

1:19:57.256 --> 1:19:58.382
That ain't yours.

1:19:59.800 --> 1:20:02.135
Palmer got it for me for my birthday.

1:20:03.303 --> 1:20:04.888
Hey. Guess what?

1:20:06.056 --> 1:20:08.684
I got you the best present ever.

1:20:09.268 --> 1:20:10.811
Greatest thing in the world.

1:20:11.395 --> 1:20:15.357
And I had to travel so far to get it.
Far and wide.

1:20:15.440 --> 1:20:17.192
And I chased the rainbow for you.

1:20:18.485 --> 1:20:19.945
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:20:20.028 --> 1:20:21.363
And it's pretty.

1:20:22.656 --> 1:20:24.032
I'm excited to give it to you.

1:20:24.116 --> 1:20:25.325
All right, kiddo.

1:20:25.701 --> 1:20:29.746
Wow. You really moved in here, huh?

1:20:29.830 --> 1:20:32.499
-Well, you were gone a while.
-Yeah.

1:20:34.084 --> 1:20:35.169
Come on. Let's go.

1:20:37.796 --> 1:20:40.507
Sam, I said it's time to go. Come on.

1:20:41.633 --> 1:20:42.634
Go on.

1:20:43.677 --> 1:20:47.014
Thanks for watching him for me.
Let's go get your present. Come on.

1:20:47.097 --> 1:20:48.515
Let's go home.

1:20:48.599 --> 1:20:50.267
I wanna take a bath.

1:21:45.405 --> 1:21:46.615
Hey, is Sam okay?

1:21:48.700 --> 1:21:49.910
Shelly came back.

1:21:51.286 --> 1:21:52.371
She did?

1:21:54.456 --> 1:21:56.208
Didn't look too good either.

1:21:57.167 --> 1:21:58.919
Kinda sickly, you know?

1:21:59.962 --> 1:22:01.880
I'm sure he'll be back tomorrow.

1:22:02.506 --> 1:22:03.674
I hope so.

1:22:07.678 --> 1:22:09.096
-Hey--
-I'm gonna--

1:22:09.179 --> 1:22:11.640
-I'm gonna get back--
-Yeah, no. I'll let you get back.

1:22:38.584 --> 1:22:39.585
Hey.

1:22:40.711 --> 1:22:41.879
Where's your lunch box?

1:22:43.589 --> 1:22:44.923
Jerry threw it away.

1:22:47.009 --> 1:22:49.887
Did he? What'd he do that for?

1:22:50.804 --> 1:22:53.765
He said my mama
was raising me to be a queer,

1:22:53.849 --> 1:22:56.393
and he ain't living with no queer kid.

1:22:59.563 --> 1:23:00.981
What does queer mean?

1:23:03.150 --> 1:23:05.485
Well, some people
think it means you're different.

1:23:06.528 --> 1:23:07.696
Are you queer?

1:23:08.780 --> 1:23:10.991
Well, I'm different. That's for sure.

1:23:14.578 --> 1:23:15.579
Hey.

1:23:16.288 --> 1:23:17.873
You know what else we are?

1:23:19.666 --> 1:23:20.834
Good-looking.

1:23:22.377 --> 1:23:25.214
No, don't laugh.
We're both good-looking fellas.

1:23:25.297 --> 1:23:27.549
It intimidates people. Makes 'em afraid.

1:23:29.968 --> 1:23:32.179
Plus you can never trust a guy
with a mullet.

1:23:32.888 --> 1:23:34.223
What's a mullet?

1:23:34.306 --> 1:23:37.309
It's creepy is what it is.
Come on, I'll give you a ride to school.

1:23:37.935 --> 1:23:39.019
Thanks, Palmer.

1:23:39.603 --> 1:23:42.314
Hey, how about after school
I take you to get a root beer float?

1:23:42.397 --> 1:23:44.983
I can't. I gotta help my mama.

1:23:45.442 --> 1:23:48.237
-Why?
-'Cause we're moving to Jerry's.

1:23:48.320 --> 1:23:50.739
And I'm gonna have to go
to another school.

1:23:53.283 --> 1:23:55.953
I guess I'll just have to visit you then.

1:23:56.036 --> 1:23:57.037
Promise?

1:23:57.955 --> 1:23:59.373
You got my word, kiddo.

1:24:19.935 --> 1:24:23.605
Let's go. Come on. Christ.
Like mother like daughter. You two.

1:24:23.689 --> 1:24:24.773
Yeah.

1:24:25.691 --> 1:24:27.734
I love the commentary.

1:24:27.818 --> 1:24:30.195
You always rush me. Don't rush me!

1:24:58.974 --> 1:25:00.851
...you fucking touch me!

1:25:00.934 --> 1:25:02.186
Get away from me!

1:25:02.269 --> 1:25:04.813
Just calm the fuck down,
all right. This ain't my goddamn fault.

1:25:04.897 --> 1:25:07.649
-Get the fuck away from me.
-Just going up here, just listening.

1:25:07.733 --> 1:25:09.193
-Hey.
-Ain't like it's the first time.

1:25:09.276 --> 1:25:10.777
Hey.

1:25:10.861 --> 1:25:11.862
What was that?

1:25:13.405 --> 1:25:15.365
What the fuck is going on? Where's Sam?

1:25:17.534 --> 1:25:20.204
-Where is he?
-He's gone. He ain't here.

1:25:23.373 --> 1:25:27.628
The fucking police.
The CPS, they took him away.

1:25:35.010 --> 1:25:36.929
Mother of the fucking year you are.

1:25:41.058 --> 1:25:44.603
There's a case hearing with
his mother in family court on Monday.

1:25:44.686 --> 1:25:47.606
The judge will decide then
if Sam is placed into a home

1:25:47.689 --> 1:25:49.274
or returned to his mother.

1:25:50.651 --> 1:25:54.655
Normally, we try to find relatives
for temporary custody.

1:25:54.738 --> 1:25:56.532
I'll need you to fill out this paperwork.

1:25:57.908 --> 1:25:59.785
I have a felony record.

1:26:00.536 --> 1:26:02.204
Are you currently on parole?

1:26:03.580 --> 1:26:07.960
I'm sorry. The agency won't approve
a foster care license if you're on parole.

1:26:11.004 --> 1:26:12.005
Can I see him?

1:26:12.089 --> 1:26:14.258
-No.
-He's probably scared, ma'am.

1:26:14.341 --> 1:26:16.885
-If he could just see a friendly face--
-Sir, I understand.

1:26:16.969 --> 1:26:20.848
But not unless you're a parent,
a family member, or a legal guardian.

1:26:23.058 --> 1:26:25.602
It's possible
the judge could make an exception.

1:26:26.103 --> 1:26:27.771
It's unlikely.

1:26:32.818 --> 1:26:33.986
What do you want?

1:26:35.529 --> 1:26:36.655
Where's Jerry?

1:26:38.156 --> 1:26:39.658
I don't know. You tell me.

1:26:41.201 --> 1:26:44.079
Hey, you got a cigarette for me?

1:26:49.751 --> 1:26:50.752
Thank you.

1:27:00.304 --> 1:27:01.805
Why are you here, huh?

1:27:06.226 --> 1:27:07.352
What's this?

1:27:16.195 --> 1:27:17.821
A legal guardian?

1:27:18.405 --> 1:27:20.532
You'd be signing Sam over to my care.

1:27:23.785 --> 1:27:25.287
Why the fuck would I do that?

1:27:25.370 --> 1:27:28.665
Because unless you get clean, I don't see
the courts giving him back to you.

1:27:30.167 --> 1:27:32.002
I need you to get outta my house.

1:27:32.628 --> 1:27:33.754
Take it.

1:27:45.349 --> 1:27:47.559
You think you can buy my son?

1:27:47.643 --> 1:27:48.852
No.

1:27:50.771 --> 1:27:53.106
-You think that you're better than me?
-No.

1:27:53.190 --> 1:27:54.399
I think you do.

1:27:55.234 --> 1:27:57.569
You think just 'cause you fucked me...

1:27:58.779 --> 1:28:00.322
that you're his daddy?

1:28:03.116 --> 1:28:04.660
You ain't his fucking daddy.

1:28:05.285 --> 1:28:07.246
And you ain't fucking better
than me neither.

1:28:07.329 --> 1:28:09.540
-And I don't want your money.
-I don't think I'm better than you.

1:28:09.623 --> 1:28:12.042
-Oh, yeah.
-Hey, I don't think I'm better than you.

1:28:12.709 --> 1:28:15.170
Hell, maybe a little bit luckier
this time around.

1:28:15.254 --> 1:28:17.297
But if something were to happen to you...

1:28:18.507 --> 1:28:21.176
they will take Sam
and put him wherever they want.

1:28:22.386 --> 1:28:23.762
-No.
-And you and I both know...

1:28:23.846 --> 1:28:26.557
-No.
-...he ain't like other boys.

1:28:27.474 --> 1:28:29.643
They are gonna give Sammy back to me.

1:28:31.228 --> 1:28:34.189
Sammy and I, we're gonna be fine. Okay?

1:28:34.273 --> 1:28:38.735
We're gonna leave this shit town
behind us, and I'm gonna get clean.

1:28:38.819 --> 1:28:40.821
I'm gonna do it, you know?

1:28:41.780 --> 1:28:44.157
Hey! I'm gonna buy us a big house.

1:28:44.616 --> 1:28:48.662
I'm gonna show you, and you will see
that I can do it.

1:28:48.745 --> 1:28:49.913
I can--

1:28:50.706 --> 1:28:52.791
-Please take the money.
-No.

1:28:53.250 --> 1:28:55.711
-Shelly, listen to me.
-Don't look at me like that.

1:28:55.794 --> 1:28:57.045
-Please.
-No.

1:28:57.129 --> 1:28:58.505
Don't look at me like that.

1:28:59.006 --> 1:29:00.591
Don't look at me!

1:29:02.718 --> 1:29:03.802
Get outta my house.

1:29:05.762 --> 1:29:07.181
Get outta my house!

1:29:09.516 --> 1:29:12.519
Get the fuck out of my house!

1:29:29.411 --> 1:29:31.496
I'm sorry to just show up like this.

1:29:40.714 --> 1:29:42.716
Mr. Palmer, come with me.

1:29:50.516 --> 1:29:55.312
Mr. Palmer, you appear to be moving
in the right direction, doing well.

1:29:55.896 --> 1:29:59.816
And perhaps, once you get
your living situation squared away

1:29:59.900 --> 1:30:01.944
and are no longer on parole...

1:30:03.028 --> 1:30:05.197
you can apply for the license again.

1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:06.281
Please.

1:30:07.115 --> 1:30:09.117
I did what I did when I was younger,

1:30:09.868 --> 1:30:12.788
and I got what I got,
so I ain't blaming nobody, Your Honor.

1:30:13.622 --> 1:30:19.837
But truth is, I haven't felt like
I was good at anything in a long time...

1:30:20.629 --> 1:30:21.630
until Sam.

1:30:24.216 --> 1:30:28.512
My decision is that the boy
will remain under the care of the state.

1:30:28.595 --> 1:30:30.722
He will be placed
in a registered foster home

1:30:30.806 --> 1:30:34.184
until the mother is well enough
to regain custody.

1:30:34.268 --> 1:30:36.770
Your Honor, she's a drug addict.
That ain't gonna happen.

1:30:36.854 --> 1:30:38.230
But, for now, I'm sorry.

1:30:38.313 --> 1:30:41.275
I have to deny your request
for temporary custody.

1:30:41.358 --> 1:30:42.776
Don't do this.

1:30:42.860 --> 1:30:45.863
I know what it feels like
to be left alone.

1:30:47.322 --> 1:30:48.615
I can't abandon that boy.

1:30:48.699 --> 1:30:50.868
I will not abandon that boy.

1:30:53.453 --> 1:30:54.663
I promise you...

1:30:55.789 --> 1:30:57.875
nobody would ever have to worry
about Sam again.

1:30:57.958 --> 1:30:59.668
I'd take real good care of him.

1:31:00.752 --> 1:31:02.004
Real good care.

1:31:03.255 --> 1:31:05.257
I'm sorry. That's my decision.

1:31:11.722 --> 1:31:12.806
Excuse me, ma'am.

1:31:12.890 --> 1:31:15.475
-I'm supposed to be there. Hey! I'm here.
-You can't go in there.

1:31:15.559 --> 1:31:18.395
Sir, get your hands off me. I'm here.

1:31:18.478 --> 1:31:20.981
-I'm sorry I'm late.
-I'm sorry, Your Honor.

1:31:21.064 --> 1:31:23.192
-What is he doing here?
-Excuse me.

1:31:23.275 --> 1:31:24.443
I am Sam's mother.

1:31:24.526 --> 1:31:27.446
-Please do not approach the bench.
-Ma'am-- Sorry, ma'am, no.

1:31:29.364 --> 1:31:32.242
Your Honor, I'm sorry I'm late.
But I'm here.

1:31:33.202 --> 1:31:36.747
Ma'am, them police,
they didn't even talk to Sam, okay?

1:31:36.830 --> 1:31:39.333
They just came into my house,
and they took my boy away.

1:31:39.416 --> 1:31:40.918
And they didn't even say why.

1:31:41.001 --> 1:31:44.963
Miss Burdette, a complaint of abuse
and neglect has been made

1:31:45.047 --> 1:31:46.673
to Child Protective Services.

1:31:46.757 --> 1:31:50.010
And you were described
as being violent and agitated.

1:31:50.093 --> 1:31:52.513
That ain't true. Ma'am, no.

1:31:54.890 --> 1:31:58.393
Agitated, yes. I was agitated.
I'll admit to that.

1:31:59.478 --> 1:32:01.897
I've had some health problems recently.

1:32:01.980 --> 1:32:04.066
I ain't trying to deny that.

1:32:05.192 --> 1:32:09.071
Listen, I don't know what your notes say,
or what he said, or anyone else.

1:32:09.571 --> 1:32:12.074
But I ain't never laid a hand on my boy.

1:32:12.950 --> 1:32:15.202
I ain't never even
raised my voice to Sammy.

1:32:15.285 --> 1:32:16.745
Ma'am, he ain't an unhappy boy.

1:32:16.828 --> 1:32:18.956
-Miss Burdette, I understand.
-I'll do whatever you want.

1:32:19.039 --> 1:32:21.583
What? You wanna piss-test me?
Then fine. Test me.

1:32:23.168 --> 1:32:24.545
I beg you.

1:32:24.628 --> 1:32:27.381
Please don't send my little boy
to go live with no strangers.

1:32:31.134 --> 1:32:32.678
He needs to be with his mama.

1:32:34.221 --> 1:32:35.347
Please.

1:33:08.922 --> 1:33:10.215
You good?

1:33:10.924 --> 1:33:11.925
Sam?

1:33:12.634 --> 1:33:14.845
Hey, Sammy. Come on, baby.

1:33:15.888 --> 1:33:18.765
Hey. More to put in the car. Come on.

1:33:25.272 --> 1:33:27.649
I am fucking tired
of your fucking bullshit!

1:33:27.733 --> 1:33:29.193
Goddamn it! You again?

1:33:29.276 --> 1:33:32.404
How many fucking times do I gotta tell you
to stop all these fucking things?

1:33:32.487 --> 1:33:34.823
I am so tired of you!

1:33:34.907 --> 1:33:37.201
I'm gonna burn down this fucking trailer.

1:33:37.284 --> 1:33:40.621
And you and that half a fag kid
are gonna be out on the goddamn streets.

1:33:40.704 --> 1:33:42.497
He's gonna be sucking dick by Christmas.

1:33:42.581 --> 1:33:44.625
I am fucking tired
of your fucking bullshit.

1:33:48.420 --> 1:33:51.006
You lying fucking whore!
Go ahead. Fucking say it.

1:33:51.089 --> 1:33:53.717
-What the fuck is wrong with you anyway?
-Mama!

1:33:53.800 --> 1:33:55.260
Get off of my mama!

1:33:55.344 --> 1:33:56.512
-Get off of me!
-Mama!

1:33:56.595 --> 1:33:58.931
-Get this goddamn kid off of me. Go!
-Don't hurt my baby, please!

1:33:59.014 --> 1:34:00.724
-Get off me, you little shit!
-Please!

1:34:00.807 --> 1:34:02.434
Is that what you want?
Let me tell you where I'm gonna put your--

1:34:02.518 --> 1:34:04.311
-No! Hey!
-What?

1:34:05.729 --> 1:34:07.523
Oh, my God.

1:34:07.606 --> 1:34:09.525
You just made Jerry fly.

1:34:10.067 --> 1:34:11.860
He just fucking flew.

1:34:12.694 --> 1:34:14.988
I ain't never seen him do that before.

1:34:17.032 --> 1:34:19.409
-Come on, Sam. Come on.
-He flew!

1:34:19.952 --> 1:34:20.953
Hey.

1:34:21.745 --> 1:34:23.705
Hey! Where are you going with my boy?

1:34:24.206 --> 1:34:26.375
Hey! Son of a bitch!

1:34:36.385 --> 1:34:39.346
Hey. It's gonna be all right. Okay?

1:34:39.972 --> 1:34:41.223
-Okay.
-All right?

1:34:41.306 --> 1:34:42.307
All right.

1:35:00.492 --> 1:35:02.077
Stay here, Sam, okay?

1:35:06.832 --> 1:35:08.500
You got a phone I can use?

1:35:09.376 --> 1:35:10.377
Thank you.

1:35:18.635 --> 1:35:19.636
Hello?

1:35:20.053 --> 1:35:21.096
It's me.

1:35:21.680 --> 1:35:24.016
-I took Sam.
-Jesus Christ.

1:35:24.099 --> 1:35:26.560
Eddie, Shelly called the police.
They're looking for you.

1:35:27.686 --> 1:35:28.937
You gotta bring him back.

1:35:29.021 --> 1:35:30.856
I can't. Not to that.

1:35:30.939 --> 1:35:33.192
-Eddie, it's kidnapping.
-She ain't fit.

1:35:33.275 --> 1:35:36.028
Maybe so, but where you gonna go?

1:35:36.778 --> 1:35:39.281
You wanna go back to prison?
Is that what you want?

1:35:40.782 --> 1:35:43.368
She's Sam's mother, Eddie.

1:35:44.328 --> 1:35:47.956
Good or bad, right or wrong,
she's Sam's mother.

1:35:58.634 --> 1:35:59.718
Call Coles.

1:36:10.103 --> 1:36:11.355
What are we gonna do?

1:36:36.004 --> 1:36:38.549
Everything's gonna be okay. All right?

1:36:43.887 --> 1:36:45.305
There's my boy! Sammy!

1:36:45.389 --> 1:36:48.100
-Get back.
-No! Hey. Sammy!

1:36:48.183 --> 1:36:49.393
-Oh, my God.
-Hey, hey.

1:36:49.476 --> 1:36:51.728
You fucking let go of me! Oh, my God. No!

1:36:51.812 --> 1:36:52.896
Hold her.

1:36:53.647 --> 1:36:57.150
-We gotta get out now. Come on.
-Sammy! Baby!

1:36:57.234 --> 1:36:59.862
-Hold her. Steady.
-Sammy! Sammy!

1:36:59.945 --> 1:37:02.281
-I'm gonna take you to court.
-Calm down.

1:37:02.364 --> 1:37:03.949
Get her on the ground and keep her there.

1:37:04.032 --> 1:37:05.200
-Shit.
-Sammy.

1:37:05.284 --> 1:37:08.245
-I'm calm! Sammy, come to Mama.
-Look. She ain't in any shape.

1:37:08.328 --> 1:37:10.747
-Out of her goddamn mind.
-Please, baby, come here.

1:37:10.831 --> 1:37:12.249
Yeah.

1:37:12.332 --> 1:37:14.543
I'm gonna take Sammy to Maggie's.
He'll stay there for now.

1:37:14.626 --> 1:37:16.128
-My baby.
-All right?

1:37:16.211 --> 1:37:18.797
I love you. Hi. Are you okay?

1:37:18.881 --> 1:37:21.842
Did he hurt you? So worried about you.

1:37:21.925 --> 1:37:23.844
-I'm so sorry. Truly.
-Turn around, Eddie.

1:37:23.927 --> 1:37:25.220
Tell me you're okay.

1:37:25.971 --> 1:37:27.389
Put your hands behind your back.

1:37:28.473 --> 1:37:30.809
You just couldn't stay outta trouble,
could ya?

1:37:31.977 --> 1:37:33.770
-Mama was so worried about you.
-Let's go.

1:37:33.854 --> 1:37:36.231
Hey, baby. My precious boy.

1:37:36.315 --> 1:37:38.192
Don't you let him go back into the system.

1:37:38.275 --> 1:37:40.068
-It's okay.
-No!

1:37:40.152 --> 1:37:41.737
No, Sammy, Sammy, no.

1:37:41.820 --> 1:37:44.781
-Let him go!
-Hey, hey. Come on, Sammy.

1:37:44.865 --> 1:37:46.658
-Stop. Hey. I said stop it.
-You get your fucking hands off my boy!

1:37:46.742 --> 1:37:48.410
-Knew they let you out too soon.
-You're hurting him.

1:37:48.493 --> 1:37:50.120
-Come on, Sammy.
-No, baby!

1:37:50.204 --> 1:37:52.706
-Let him go!
-Sammy.

1:37:53.332 --> 1:37:54.917
Hey, baby. I love you.

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:57.294
I got you. Your mama loves you.
I'm gonna take care of you.

1:37:57.377 --> 1:37:59.838
-You never take care of me!
-I love you. Yes, I do.

1:37:59.922 --> 1:38:02.674
-You never do!
-I do. I do. I got you, honey.

1:38:02.758 --> 1:38:04.593
Let me go!

1:38:06.345 --> 1:38:07.804
Palmer!

1:38:10.349 --> 1:38:11.892
Palmer!

1:38:12.935 --> 1:38:14.311
Go to your mama, Sam.

1:38:15.062 --> 1:38:17.105
Palmer!

1:38:18.607 --> 1:38:20.442
-It's okay.
-Palmer.

1:38:21.026 --> 1:38:22.027
Sam.

1:38:22.110 --> 1:38:23.612
Palmer!

1:38:24.196 --> 1:38:25.572
Palmer!

1:38:27.366 --> 1:38:28.617
Palmer!

1:38:30.285 --> 1:38:31.703
Palmer!

1:38:32.621 --> 1:38:34.831
Palmer!

1:38:35.749 --> 1:38:37.292
Palmer!

1:39:19.918 --> 1:39:21.253
You're free to go.

1:39:23.130 --> 1:39:27.050
Shelly said you were just taking Sam
to get something to eat.

1:39:29.720 --> 1:39:31.471
Too high to remember, I guess.

1:39:32.764 --> 1:39:34.850
So we gotta drop the charges.

1:39:36.351 --> 1:39:38.145
Sam's still at Maggie's.

1:39:47.070 --> 1:39:48.071
Hey.

1:39:50.616 --> 1:39:51.700
I owed you one.

1:39:53.243 --> 1:39:55.412
Yeah. You did.

1:40:22.022 --> 1:40:23.607
You think I'm a terrible mother.

1:40:36.495 --> 1:40:37.496
Hey, Sammy.

1:40:45.212 --> 1:40:46.213
Hi, baby.

1:41:01.770 --> 1:41:02.771
Hey.

1:41:07.860 --> 1:41:09.528
I know you're mad at me.

1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:12.281
It's okay.

1:41:13.907 --> 1:41:15.409
I'd be mad at me too.

1:41:18.036 --> 1:41:22.291
Well, I need to talk to you
about something real important.

1:41:24.251 --> 1:41:25.961
Do you think we could do that?

1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:29.423
Yeah, I can sit here with you?

1:41:29.506 --> 1:41:30.549
Yeah, Mama.

1:41:31.884 --> 1:41:32.885
Thank you.

1:41:43.896 --> 1:41:46.231
I've been doing some thinking
about some things.

1:41:50.485 --> 1:41:53.280
I think it would be best
if you live with Palmer.

1:41:56.700 --> 1:41:57.868
He's a good man.

1:41:58.911 --> 1:42:00.829
And he cares about you so much.

1:42:03.582 --> 1:42:04.583
And...

1:42:13.592 --> 1:42:15.969
I'm struggling.

1:42:17.346 --> 1:42:20.098
Baby, I'm really struggling now.

1:42:25.521 --> 1:42:26.605
But--

1:42:26.688 --> 1:42:28.440
Give me your hands.

1:42:30.692 --> 1:42:32.694
It isn't because I don't love you.

1:42:36.365 --> 1:42:38.408
I love you with all my heart.

1:42:43.914 --> 1:42:45.207
What do you think?

1:42:50.796 --> 1:42:52.464
You wanna live with Palmer?

1:42:54.299 --> 1:42:56.051
You want him to be your daddy?

1:42:56.134 --> 1:42:58.387
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1:43:04.518 --> 1:43:06.520
Come here and give me a hug.

1:43:20.450 --> 1:43:21.577
All right.

1:43:45.309 --> 1:43:46.643
Got everything you need?

1:43:46.727 --> 1:43:48.270
Looks like it.

1:43:48.353 --> 1:43:51.190
Are we gonna have dinner tonight
with Miss Maggie?

1:43:51.273 --> 1:43:53.942
Yep. She's cooking
your favorite, broccoli.

1:43:54.026 --> 1:43:55.277
Broccoli?

1:43:58.071 --> 1:44:00.741
Forbes's air conditioner is fixed.
I'll get it over to him.

1:44:02.451 --> 1:44:03.452
Palmer.

1:44:05.454 --> 1:44:06.663
I have something for you.

1:44:17.466 --> 1:44:18.675
Your keys.

1:44:20.302 --> 1:44:22.012
I think you've earned these.

1:44:27.976 --> 1:44:29.102
Thank you, Sibs.

1:44:31.021 --> 1:44:33.440
Well, Junior don't like to wait.
Get on outta here.

1:44:40.572 --> 1:44:42.741
-Bye, Sam.
-Bye, Emily.

1:44:43.617 --> 1:44:45.077
Hey, when's our next tea party?

1:44:45.619 --> 1:44:47.454
I don't know. You tell me.

1:44:48.747 --> 1:44:50.249
I don't know the schedule.

1:44:56.713 --> 1:44:58.924
Come on. We gotta go pick something up.

1:45:21.196 --> 1:45:23.407
Hey, Sam? Come here.

1:45:27.911 --> 1:45:28.912
It's for you.

1:45:32.583 --> 1:45:34.501
I've never got mail before.

1:45:34.585 --> 1:45:36.128
Open it. See what it says.

1:45:53.770 --> 1:45:55.606
Look at it. There's a golden star.

1:45:55.689 --> 1:45:58.317
And look at my name. It's right here.
Sam Burdette, and--

1:45:58.400 --> 1:46:00.319
Yeah. Yeah.

1:46:04.740 --> 1:46:05.949
Hey.

1:46:06.033 --> 1:46:07.159
Congratulations.
