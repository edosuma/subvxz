00:01.500 --> 00:07.288
This is the BBC. The following
programme is based on actual events.

00:07.298 --> 00:09.958
It's important to remember,
however,

00:09.968 --> 00:13.086
that you can't rewrite history.
Not one line.

00:13.096 --> 00:17.935
Except, perhaps, when you embark
on an Adventure In Space And Time...

00:19.000 --> 00:25.074

01:33.019 --> 01:36.013
Everything all right, sir?

01:36.023 --> 01:38.359
Are you okay?

01:39.610 --> 01:41.738
You need to move along now, sir.

01:43.364 --> 01:44.605
Sir...

01:44.615 --> 01:47.786
You're in the way.

01:49.880 --> 01:55.294
<i>Hello?
Er, Mr Hartnell?</i>

01:56.796 --> 02:00.378
<i>Mr Hartnell, sir, they're
asking for you now.</i>

02:03.429 --> 02:05.504
<i>Shall I tell them
you're coming now?</i>

02:05.514 --> 02:08.431
- Tell them what you like.
- Beg your pardon, Mr Hartnell?

02:08.542 --> 02:10.311
Tell them
what you bloody well like!

02:12.272 --> 02:16.944
- Listen, I'm only doing my job.
- Sod off, will you! I'm not ready!

02:23.534 --> 02:25.579
I need more time.

02:44.433 --> 02:45.882
Len! Len, for God's sake!

02:45.893 --> 02:48.386
You'll go up like a Roman Candle,
if you're not careful.

02:48.396 --> 02:50.763
Can I take my head off, mate?
I'm boiling in here.

02:50.773 --> 02:53.140
No. We'll be starting up
again in a minute.

02:53.151 --> 02:54.935
Why? What's the hold up?

02:54.945 --> 02:56.697
You know who.

03:01.619 --> 03:03.610
Well, tell him
to get his skates on!

03:03.621 --> 03:05.326
Some of us have got a
bloody planet to invade.

03:05.330 --> 03:07.544
- Shh!
- What?

03:57.265 --> 03:59.173
Can I see your pass, sir?

03:59.183 --> 04:01.543
Ah, come on, Harry.
You know my face!

04:01.553 --> 04:05.096
- That's as maybe, sir.
- Sydney Newman. Clue's in the name.

04:05.107 --> 04:09.226
- Better than any mug-shot.
- Still need to see your pass, sir.

04:09.237 --> 04:11.145
Ah, to hell with it!

04:11.155 --> 04:15.775
That's not the way
we do things at the BBC, sir!

04:15.785 --> 04:18.873
You don't say!

04:39.520 --> 04:41.304
So, we got a great,

04:41.315 --> 04:44.515
big thumping audience for
Grandstand, but we lose them

04:44.526 --> 04:47.853
before the teeny boppers
tune in for Juke Box Jury, right?

04:47.863 --> 04:50.689
- Right. Erm...correct.
- We got a gap to plug.

04:50.699 --> 04:53.609
- 25 minutes.
- How about another Dickens?

04:53.620 --> 04:56.445
Fossilised, Mervyn! Fusty. Frowsty.

04:56.456 --> 04:59.199
And lots of less polite words
beginning with F.

04:59.209 --> 05:03.078
Here's a word for you, though - fun!
FUN! You heard of fun, Mervyn?

05:03.088 --> 05:06.115
It that something else
you've brought from ITV?

05:06.125 --> 05:08.150
I hope so, I certainly hope so!

05:08.160 --> 05:12.638
We need stuff to keep the sports
fans hooked and the kids too.

05:12.649 --> 05:14.550
Competitive Tiddlywinks?

05:14.560 --> 05:17.678
You know what I'm talking about.
science fiction?

05:17.688 --> 05:21.808
Is it really that popular?
It was last time I took a look.

05:21.818 --> 05:26.772
With juvenile boys, perhaps.
I like it.

05:26.782 --> 05:30.776
♪ Oh, let's have a wonderful time
Let's have a wonderful time

05:30.786 --> 05:34.155
♪ Come on, everybody
and let's have a wonderful time... ♪

05:35.315 --> 05:37.642
She thought the balloon had gone up.

05:37.653 --> 05:39.869
- What?
- She thought we'd all had it.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.999
Cuba! No point in holding back
if the missiles started flying.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.388
So she put it about a bit.
A lot!

05:52.853 --> 05:56.597
So what did they say? "You're only
a production assistant, dear.

05:56.607 --> 06:00.184
"It's a bit of a leap."
I'm giving myself a year, Jackie.

06:00.195 --> 06:04.855
Get on in television or get out.
Oh. What do I know?

06:04.866 --> 06:07.901
I spend my time trying not to
bump into the cameras,

06:07.911 --> 06:11.864
but don't pack in yet, Verity.
Softly, softly, eh?

06:11.874 --> 06:14.825
- Mmm. You've got a... What?
- Red wine.

06:14.836 --> 06:16.839
Oh. Red wine.

06:18.590 --> 06:21.207
- Oh, Lord, it's on, isn't it?
- What?

06:21.218 --> 06:25.421
The space shot! The Soviets.
Valentina what's-it.

06:25.431 --> 06:28.939
- First woman in space!
- Oh, God, yes!

06:34.567 --> 06:38.768
And there she is,
Valentina Tereshkova looking,

06:38.779 --> 06:42.940
appropriately enough,
on top of the world.

06:48.832 --> 06:50.960
Pop, pop, pop.

06:52.670 --> 06:54.328
The first woman in space,

06:54.338 --> 06:57.081
a major triumph there
for the Soviet Union

06:57.092 --> 06:59.459
in the ever-escalating space race.

07:03.808 --> 07:06.133
- Hello?
- Verity, it's Sydney.

07:06.143 --> 07:07.907
- What?
- Sydney!

07:07.908 --> 07:11.024
Sydney!
Hello, stranger.

07:11.608 --> 07:14.851
- You know anything about children, Verity?
- Not a thing.

07:14.862 --> 07:19.482
We want to do a science fiction
serial. Legitimate stuff, though.

07:19.492 --> 07:23.277
- No tin robots or BEMs.
- BEMs?

07:23.287 --> 07:27.449
Bug-Eyed Monsters! You know...
mutations and Death Rays.

07:27.459 --> 07:30.077
Brains in glass jars,
that kind of crap.

07:30.087 --> 07:32.371
It's going to run all year.

07:32.381 --> 07:35.123
So a good-looking guy,
a good-looking girl

07:35.134 --> 07:38.002
and a kid who gets herself
into all kinds of trouble.

07:38.013 --> 07:41.465
Plus an older man. Quirky.
I'll come back to him.

07:41.475 --> 07:45.126
They travel about in space
and time getting into scrapes!

07:45.137 --> 07:48.494
- That's a lovely idea!
- You know me. Pop! Pop! Pop!

07:50.151 --> 07:52.644
And we want history too.
Proper history.

07:52.654 --> 07:55.939
The kids at home should learn
something.

07:55.949 --> 07:58.484
And what about this other man?
The quirky character?

07:58.494 --> 08:00.986
- He's a doctor.
- A doctor?
- Mm-hmm.

08:00.997 --> 08:03.447
He should be a doctor,
don't you think?

08:03.457 --> 08:06.503
Makes him an authority figure,
Sorta, kinda reassuring.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.761
So, what do you think?

08:14.971 --> 08:18.589
Look, Sydney, I'd love to work with
you again. Really I would.

08:18.600 --> 08:21.218
It's just...

08:21.228 --> 08:24.512
I gave myself a year.
Get on in TV or get out...

08:24.523 --> 08:26.432
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:26.442 --> 08:30.269
I don't want you to
be my assistant again, kid!

08:30.279 --> 08:33.606
I want you to produce it!

08:33.616 --> 08:36.025
Produce it?

08:36.035 --> 08:39.623
Sure. They've never had a female
producer here! Sit down!

08:42.418 --> 08:44.284
You're just what this place needs!

08:44.296 --> 08:49.491
- Someone with piss and
vinegar in their veins!
- Thanks! I think.

08:49.502 --> 08:53.762
- I did a show called
Pathfinders at ITV. You see it?
- Um...

08:53.772 --> 08:57.967
We had an old guy as the hero.
A grumpy old guy.

08:57.977 --> 09:00.314
That's what we want here.

09:03.358 --> 09:09.480
Wait for it! Attention!

09:09.490 --> 09:12.775
Oh, my stars!
What did I do to deserve you lot?

09:12.786 --> 09:14.204
Drivel.

09:16.373 --> 09:22.077
- We'll make her a skirt...
- No-one rung?

09:22.087 --> 09:25.915
- Not since you last asked.
- All right.

09:25.925 --> 09:27.958
- Five minutes ago.
- All right, all right!

09:27.969 --> 09:30.337
You've only been out of work
a couple of weeks.

09:30.347 --> 09:32.589
Well, I'm not built
for lazing around, am I?

09:32.599 --> 09:34.925
I've got to graft
or I'll go round the twist.

09:34.936 --> 09:37.553
What about that play?

09:37.563 --> 09:42.058
Another ruddy army part! No fear.
That's all they ever offer me.

09:42.068 --> 09:45.267
Crooks and perishing
Sergeant Majors!

09:45.302 --> 09:51.361
But that's how casting people
see you, isn't it, love?
Authority figures.

09:51.371 --> 09:55.823
♪ - My grandfather's a funny 'un... ♪
- Don't do that.

09:55.834 --> 09:59.661
♪ He's got a face
like a pickled onion. ♪

09:59.672 --> 10:04.250
- Stop it! Bloody rubbish.
- Bill! Not in front of Judi.

10:04.260 --> 10:08.004
♪ - My Grandfather's a funny 'un. ♪
- I said stop it!

10:08.015 --> 10:11.132
Why are you always so grumpy, Sampa?

10:11.143 --> 10:14.897
What? What's it got to
do with you?  Silly girl!

10:17.024 --> 10:22.403
Judi? Judi-poodi, darling?
For goodness' sake, Bill!

10:22.413 --> 10:25.315
- Go after her!
- I told the girl once.
What's wrong with her?

10:25.326 --> 10:30.028
- Cloth-ears?
- Urgh! Don't you like being successful?

10:30.039 --> 10:34.825
That's not success! I'm legitimate!
A legitimate character actor

10:34.836 --> 10:37.631
of the stage and film!
This is variety!

10:40.968 --> 10:43.388
I only asked.

11:31.149 --> 11:33.725
What about Leslie French?
He'd be marvelous.

11:33.736 --> 11:37.062
He's working with Visconti.
Gave us a polite no.

11:37.072 --> 11:41.216
- Cyril Cusack?
- A less polite no.

11:41.227 --> 11:44.494
- Ahem.
- Can I help you?

11:44.495 --> 11:46.002
I think you're in my office.

11:46.037 --> 11:49.243
That's a rather interesting
way of looking at it.

11:49.253 --> 11:53.747
- I'm rather an interesting person.
- I don't doubt it. Rex Tucker.

11:53.758 --> 11:55.875
I'm looking after Doctor Who.

11:55.886 --> 11:59.879
Pending the appointment
of the permanent producer.

11:59.889 --> 12:03.800
- Oh. Is he with you?
- You're looking at him.

12:03.811 --> 12:09.056
- I keep coming back to Hugh David.
- Who?

12:09.067 --> 12:12.686
He was in Knight Errant on ITV.
Lovely actor.

12:12.696 --> 12:16.064
Not old enough for the Doctor,
surely?

12:16.074 --> 12:18.401
Well, we don't want Grandpa Moses,
do we?

12:18.411 --> 12:20.444
We need someone who can play older.

12:20.455 --> 12:23.315
The shooting schedule's going to
be pretty punishing.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.785
- I've got some ideas.
- I'll call Hugh. See what he thinks.

12:25.795 --> 12:28.680
I'd rather you didn't.
Is that a fact? Waste of time!

12:30.800 --> 12:33.368
We need someone like Frank
Morgan in the Wizard Of Oz.

12:33.369 --> 12:34.368
He's dead.

12:34.403 --> 12:37.766
- Rex... And American.
- I said "like".

12:39.684 --> 12:42.594
Well, perhaps
we should all sleep on it.

12:42.605 --> 12:46.609
After all, it took them
months to find Scarlet O'Hara!

12:53.450 --> 12:57.330
Um...dear lady, may I have a word?

13:10.553 --> 13:12.471
Hello?

13:13.723 --> 13:15.642
Yes.

13:18.353 --> 13:20.773
Oh, yes?

13:25.320 --> 13:27.061
Is it right you were Sydney's

13:27.071 --> 13:29.813
production assistant
on the other channel? Yes.

13:29.824 --> 13:31.858
So this is quite a promotion.

13:31.868 --> 13:34.652
Apparently.
Bound to ruffle a few feathers.

13:34.663 --> 13:39.408
If feathers don't ruffle,
nothing flies.

13:39.418 --> 13:42.704
This show is going to be a terrific
challenge, you know.

13:42.714 --> 13:45.248
Outer space. Time travel.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.418
In the first script,
they go back to the Stone Age.

13:48.429 --> 13:51.379
You'll need all
the help you can get.

13:51.390 --> 13:55.176
So, Rex is going to act
as a sort of mentor to you.

13:55.186 --> 13:57.261
A ship can't have two captains.

13:57.271 --> 14:02.517
- Dear lady... 
- Please don't call me that.
- Sorry.

14:02.527 --> 14:07.356
And what about you, Mervyn?
What's your function?

14:07.366 --> 14:11.277
I'm to be your sort of
technical boffin.

14:11.288 --> 14:13.957
Help you through
the mire of all this.

14:15.918 --> 14:18.785
Sydney obviously thinks he's got
the right person for the job.

14:18.796 --> 14:20.912
That's what he wants for
Doctor Who.

14:20.923 --> 14:23.324
Someone with piss
and vinegar in their veins.

14:23.335 --> 14:27.504
- Did he say that?
- He's very blunt.

14:27.514 --> 14:29.464
Yes.

14:29.475 --> 14:32.968
Look, all I'm saying is, dear la...

14:32.979 --> 14:39.851
Verity. All I'm saying is that
experience is not a dirty word.

14:39.861 --> 14:41.728
Don't fight us.

14:41.738 --> 14:45.399
Perhaps you could add a few drops
of warm beer in with your...

14:45.409 --> 14:49.915
- Piss and...
- Mixture. Just for the time being.

14:51.625 --> 14:55.827
Well. We'd better clear out,
we'll have the news team in here.

14:55.838 --> 14:57.621
That's clever.

14:57.631 --> 15:01.042
So they don't have to look down
at their words all the time.

15:01.052 --> 15:03.044
Yes. Quite a wheeze.

15:03.054 --> 15:05.897
Someone'll make a fortune
out of that.

15:05.907 --> 15:12.096
- I suppose so. Shame I didn't
get to the patent office faster.
- Why?

15:12.106 --> 15:14.066
I invented it!

15:19.823 --> 15:22.065
Well, have a look at it, Bill.

15:22.075 --> 15:25.152
It certainly sounds different.

15:25.162 --> 15:28.905
And it's an old man part, you know.
Is it?

15:28.916 --> 15:31.784
Yeah! It's like This Sporting Life.

15:31.794 --> 15:34.412
Well, I love playing older!

15:34.422 --> 15:36.164
I know.

15:36.175 --> 15:38.917
Well? What next?

15:38.927 --> 15:44.506
He's going to set up a meeting. He
sounded ever so upbeat on the phone.

15:44.517 --> 15:46.311
He says it's a smashing role.

15:48.438 --> 15:49.971
For the BBC.

15:49.981 --> 15:52.391
Yeah, yeah...

15:52.401 --> 15:54.403
and it's for kiddies!

15:55.488 --> 15:57.114
Come on, Stumpy!

16:14.885 --> 16:16.126
Off to Madame Bovary.

16:16.136 --> 16:18.764
Well, I'm sure he'll be
happier away from us.

16:20.641 --> 16:24.787
- Any news from the design department?
- They're not being very helpful, I'm afraid.

16:26.064 --> 16:28.765
What is this?!
What're we going to do with this?

16:28.775 --> 16:31.643
Stone Age Man going, "Ug"!
It's crazy!

16:31.654 --> 16:35.047
Cavemen and doctors and
disappearing bloody police boxes!

16:35.057 --> 16:37.525
- What're we going to do?
- Waris Hussein. Our director.

16:37.535 --> 16:39.385
- Verity.
- Hi.

16:39.395 --> 16:41.362
What have you just been working on?

16:41.372 --> 16:43.048
Er, Compact.

16:43.059 --> 16:45.878
Oh. High art indeed.

16:48.131 --> 16:49.497
Shut up.

16:49.507 --> 16:51.290
Don't people say "Ug" in Compact?

16:51.300 --> 16:53.793
Frequently.
Mostly after a liquid lunch.

16:53.804 --> 16:57.046
The cavemen script is the only
one ready to go.

16:57.057 --> 16:58.756
We have to start with it.

16:58.767 --> 17:01.176
Right, and where are we shooting?

17:01.187 --> 17:02.928
Lime Grove. Studio D.

17:02.938 --> 17:07.474
Oh, God, not there!
We can't do anything there.

17:07.484 --> 17:11.146
It's a broom cupboard.
It's smaller on the inside.

17:11.156 --> 17:15.608
It's the wrong shape and the
sprinklers go off when it gets hot.

17:15.618 --> 17:17.778
Well, you'll make it brilliantly,
won't you?

17:17.789 --> 17:21.115
Oh. I see. Simple as that.

17:21.125 --> 17:23.252
It'll never work.

17:28.509 --> 17:30.386
When do we start?

17:37.644 --> 17:39.230
Excuse me.

17:40.814 --> 17:42.107
Excuse me.

17:43.359 --> 17:44.851
Hello?

17:44.861 --> 17:46.602
Yes, sir? Gin and tonic...

17:46.613 --> 17:48.521
Vodka and tonic
and a red wine, please.

17:48.531 --> 17:49.981
Sorry, love, I'm serving...

17:49.992 --> 17:52.484
Vodka and tonic
and a red wine, please.

17:52.494 --> 17:54.319
Vodka tonic, red wine.

17:54.329 --> 17:57.708
Thank you.
I'd have been stood here all night.

18:00.836 --> 18:04.080
"We are all strangers
in a strange land."

18:04.090 --> 18:05.331
Very profound.

18:05.342 --> 18:10.587
Isn't it? You'll find
I'm generally pretty profound.

18:10.598 --> 18:13.466
- I wish I had your front.
- I wish I had your behind.

18:13.476 --> 18:15.875
- Shh! Like a little peach.
- Shut up!

18:19.858 --> 18:23.018
Don't be fooled, Waris.
That's all it is.

18:23.028 --> 18:26.105
Front.
Inside, I'm shaking like a leaf.

18:26.115 --> 18:29.066
I'm here by the skin
of my bloody teeth.

18:29.076 --> 18:31.361
First Indian director
this place has ever had.

18:31.371 --> 18:34.405
So, we've got to stick together,
haven't we?

18:34.416 --> 18:37.409
Make our little show work.
That'll teach them.

18:37.420 --> 18:39.912
Who? The old guard.

18:39.922 --> 18:44.678
This - sea of fag smoke,
tweed and sweaty men.

18:47.181 --> 18:49.464
Not that I'm knocking sweaty men.

18:49.475 --> 18:50.726
I should hope not.

18:51.978 --> 18:56.555
Listen, I overheard a couple of old
horrors standing by the tea urn.

18:56.566 --> 19:00.852
They said, "Well, she didn't get
here standing up, did she?"

19:00.862 --> 19:02.270
Sydney's bit of fluff, am I?

19:02.280 --> 19:04.440
Well, that seems to be
the impression.

19:04.450 --> 19:06.567
How else could you get
a promotion like this?

19:06.577 --> 19:07.901
A promotion like what?

19:07.912 --> 19:11.072
I'm trying to recreate
the Stone Age with Airfix glue

19:11.082 --> 19:12.699
and bloody BacoFoil!

19:12.709 --> 19:14.450
We're trying to.

19:14.461 --> 19:15.953
Yes. Sorry.

19:15.963 --> 19:20.166
Here's to us. The posh wog!

19:20.176 --> 19:22.637
And the pushy Jewish bird!

19:23.721 --> 19:25.975
- L'chaim!
- Cheers.

19:26.809 --> 19:29.937
- We could have our own series!
- We do!

19:31.313 --> 19:35.307
I don't want any of this muck,
thanks very much. I'll have a drink.

19:35.318 --> 19:36.392
Right.

19:36.402 --> 19:38.144
You the director, son?

19:38.155 --> 19:39.604
Yes.

19:39.614 --> 19:41.731
Hardly out of the cradle,
the pair of you.

19:41.741 --> 19:45.060
Right. Let's talk turkey.

19:45.070 --> 19:48.323
- I'm not sure about this. Not sure at all.
- No?

19:48.333 --> 19:51.159
Apart from anything else, I don't
want to take on another long run.

19:51.169 --> 19:53.452
Had enough of that on
The Army Game. Nearly killed me.

19:53.463 --> 19:55.706
Weekly bloody rep!
Would you like to order drinks?

19:55.716 --> 19:59.084
Whiskey and soda.
Chopee, chopee.

19:59.094 --> 20:02.213
Whose idea was all this?
That fella from ITV?

20:02.223 --> 20:04.632
Sydney Newman, yes.

20:04.642 --> 20:08.053
But so many people have been
at the birth of the thing,
we'd be here all day...

20:11.275 --> 20:13.559
Tell me about the characters.

20:13.569 --> 20:15.227
Two school teachers.

20:15.237 --> 20:18.898
Ian and Barbara. They're intrigued
about one of their pupils.

20:18.909 --> 20:20.942
A young girl called Susan.

20:20.952 --> 20:25.530
She seems to have impossible
knowledge for a girl from 1963.

20:25.541 --> 20:31.912
So the schoolteachers follow her
home. But "home" is a junkyard...

20:31.923 --> 20:34.749
Yes, yes, yes. Scripts.
I need to see scripts.

20:34.760 --> 20:37.961
Oh, they're going wonderfully.
Wonderfully!

20:37.971 --> 20:43.634
The BBC are really excited about
the show. They're throwing...

20:43.644 --> 20:47.597
everything at it.
State of the art facilities.

20:47.607 --> 20:51.060
How do they get about?
Flying saucer or something?

20:51.070 --> 20:55.272
Ours is a space and time machine
that can blend in with
its background.

20:55.282 --> 20:58.151
You mean it's covered in
invisible paint or something?

20:58.161 --> 21:00.820
No, no...
it adapts to suit its environment.

21:00.830 --> 21:02.739
It gets stuck in one shape.

21:02.750 --> 21:04.282
A police box. A police box?

21:04.293 --> 21:08.537
How gorgeous would that be?
An ordinary 20th-century object

21:08.548 --> 21:11.665
on the surface of an alien planet!
Fantastic!

21:11.676 --> 21:15.962
- And the opening titles are like
nothing you've ever seen.
- Yes.

21:15.973 --> 21:18.339
You see, if you point
a camera down its own monitor,

21:18.350 --> 21:20.926
it creates the most wonderful
shapes, patterns...

21:20.937 --> 21:23.429
Like mirrors, endlessly reflecting.

21:23.439 --> 21:26.224
Swooping and pulsing,
like butterfly wings.

21:26.234 --> 21:28.226
Maybe I could be in them?

21:28.236 --> 21:31.855
Just pop in front of the camera
would you, Tony?

21:31.866 --> 21:34.076
Let's see how that looks.

21:38.623 --> 21:42.117
Oh, Christ, no! That's terrifying!

21:42.127 --> 21:45.287
..and wait till you hear the music,

21:45.297 --> 21:48.582
we're using the latest technology.

21:48.593 --> 21:50.167
How did you do it?

21:50.178 --> 21:52.211
Brian's house keys.

21:54.057 --> 21:55.840
And what about the Doctor himself?

21:55.851 --> 21:58.385
He's something like 600 years old.

21:58.396 --> 22:01.430
Looks like a senile old man
but he's tough.

22:01.440 --> 22:03.891
Tough and wiry like an old turkey.

22:03.902 --> 22:09.021
It's what you do so well,
Mr Hartnell. Stern and scary...

22:09.032 --> 22:12.651
- but with a twinkle.
- Trust me, Bill.
You're perfect for it.

22:12.661 --> 22:14.653
No-one will be able to resist you.

22:14.663 --> 22:16.113
You really think so?

22:16.124 --> 22:19.617
CS Lewis meets HG Wells
meets Father Christmas.

22:19.627 --> 22:21.036
That's the Doctor.

22:21.046 --> 22:22.923
Doctor who, hmm?

22:24.841 --> 22:27.960
Come on, big smiles!

22:27.970 --> 22:29.680
And again.

22:30.765 --> 22:33.925
Come on, big smiles.
Cheers! Lovely.

22:33.935 --> 22:36.094
Come on, one more.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.471
Lovely stuff. That's it!

22:37.481 --> 22:39.723
You're a brick for doing this.

22:39.733 --> 22:44.103
Contractually obliged, darling.
No, no! I mean the show.

22:44.114 --> 22:48.482
You'll all give it such gravitas.
Thank you.

22:48.493 --> 22:50.751
So, what do you make of him?

22:50.762 --> 22:53.405
Oh, I've always been a fan.
Wonderful screen actor.

22:53.415 --> 22:55.783
He frightens the life out of me.

22:55.793 --> 22:58.035
I think he's sweet. Bless him.

22:58.045 --> 23:00.924
Bless him?
He's not as old as he looks.

23:02.008 --> 23:05.209
Must've had a tough life.

23:05.220 --> 23:07.254
Are you okay?

23:07.264 --> 23:09.214
Scared to death! Me too.

23:09.225 --> 23:11.718
How about one of just
the three of you then?

23:11.728 --> 23:13.678
Oh, well. Goodbye, real world!

23:13.688 --> 23:15.940
One more.

23:20.779 --> 23:21.937
Patience.

23:21.947 --> 23:25.649
I have the patience of a saint.
But it's wearing very thin!

23:25.660 --> 23:28.695
We need the inside of the TARDIS
right now!

23:28.705 --> 23:30.155
I'm busy.

23:30.165 --> 23:32.782
You'll get your time machine
when I can find a moment...

23:32.793 --> 23:35.286
Too busy for a children's
programme, is that it?

23:35.296 --> 23:36.547
Patience.

23:41.261 --> 23:47.674
"If you could touch the alien sand
and listen to the sound of..."

23:47.685 --> 23:49.593
Bugger!

23:49.603 --> 23:55.766
"If you could touch the alien sand
and hear the cry of strange birds

23:55.777 --> 23:59.646
"and watch them wheel in
another sky, would that satisfy you?

23:59.656 --> 24:04.777
"Susan and I are cut off
from our own people.

24:04.787 --> 24:10.658
"But one day we shall get back.
Yes. One day.

24:10.669 --> 24:11.909
"One day."

24:11.920 --> 24:15.414
- Who's Susan?
- My granddaughter.

24:15.424 --> 24:17.916
I'm your granddaughter.

24:17.927 --> 24:20.920
Yes. Yes, of course you are, darling.

24:20.930 --> 24:25.801
But she's my granddaughter in the
story I'm doing on the television.

24:25.811 --> 24:29.054
I play a funny old man
who lives inside a magic box.

24:29.064 --> 24:31.766
Like a jack-in-the-box, Sampa?

24:31.776 --> 24:33.767
A little like that, yes.

24:33.778 --> 24:39.691
But, this is a machine in disguise.
A time machine.

24:39.701 --> 24:42.695
Do you know how to fly
a time machine, Sampa?

24:42.705 --> 24:48.451
Hm? Yes! Yes, of course I do!
You'll see.

24:48.461 --> 24:50.953
You'll see
when I'm on the television.

24:50.964 --> 24:55.167
We'll be going back through history
to meet kings and queens.

24:55.177 --> 24:56.918
And off to distant planets

24:56.929 --> 25:00.423
where the Doctor will have
all kinds of adventures.

25:00.433 --> 25:02.007
The Doctor?

25:02.018 --> 25:04.511
He's the old man I'm playing.

25:04.521 --> 25:08.483
A doctor?
Does he make people better?

25:13.531 --> 25:19.527
No! I have... Don't you think you're
being rather high-handed, young man?

25:19.537 --> 25:21.822
You thought you saw a young girl
enter the yard.

25:21.832 --> 25:24.366
You imagine you heard music
or her voice?

25:24.376 --> 25:28.204
You believe she might be in there?
Not very substantial, is it?

25:28.214 --> 25:29.789
But why won't you help us?

25:29.799 --> 25:33.835
I'm not hindering you.
You intrude here....

25:33.846 --> 25:37.839
- He's tetchy as hell.
- ..start making accusations
and implications.

25:37.849 --> 25:39.967
If you both want to make
fools of yourselves,

25:39.977 --> 25:41.752
I suggest you do what
you said you'd do.

25:41.763 --> 25:47.083
Go and ask a policeman...
Bugger! Fetch a policeman.

25:47.093 --> 25:50.145
While you nip off quietly
in the other direction, I suppose.

25:50.156 --> 25:51.647
Come on, Barbara.

25:51.657 --> 25:54.524
What are you doing out there,
Grandfather?

25:54.535 --> 25:57.653
Go back inside! Shut the door!
Shut that door!

25:57.664 --> 25:59.030
Barbara!

25:59.040 --> 26:00.375
OK! OK, everyone.

26:01.418 --> 26:05.579
Fantastic. That's where we stop the
tape and go inside the spaceship.

26:05.589 --> 26:06.831
When it's built!

26:06.841 --> 26:08.374
OK. Good. Well done.

26:08.384 --> 26:09.667
Everyone happy?

26:09.677 --> 26:13.171
No, I'm not happy. Not at all.
Er, Miss Lambert.

26:13.182 --> 26:14.756
A word, if you please.

26:14.766 --> 26:17.008
Coffee? Good idea. Thank you.

26:17.018 --> 26:21.513
The set for the machine? TARDIS?

26:21.524 --> 26:23.224
When is it arriving?

26:23.235 --> 26:26.102
There's, er, there's been
a...delay.

26:26.112 --> 26:31.275
It won't do. It just won't do.
I don't know how I'm expected to cope

26:31.285 --> 26:33.902
with all the technical gibberish
I have to spout

26:33.912 --> 26:36.656
without a bloody set to work on.
I'm sorry, Bill.

26:36.666 --> 26:41.328
I need time to plot out
all the buttons, you see.

26:41.338 --> 26:45.081
- Buttons?
- On the controls!
All the switches and dials.

26:45.092 --> 26:47.501
I need to know what they all do.

26:47.512 --> 26:50.004
What if I press something
to open the doors

26:50.014 --> 26:52.507
and the next week
I use it to blow us all up!

26:52.517 --> 26:54.342
You must see that?

26:54.352 --> 26:57.680
The children will spot it, you see,
if we try and fudge it.

26:57.690 --> 27:00.390
And we must discuss my character.

27:00.401 --> 27:01.767
Absolutely.

27:01.777 --> 27:04.896
He's too abrasive.
Too nasty. Do you see?

27:04.906 --> 27:07.940
Where's that twinkle
you talked about?

27:07.951 --> 27:10.819
The thing that made me
so right for it?

27:10.829 --> 27:13.154
I... Oh, Sydney!

27:13.165 --> 27:15.825
Sydney Newman, Head Of Drama,

27:15.835 --> 27:18.702
let me introduce you to
Mr William Hartnell.

27:18.713 --> 27:22.290
Right! Our Doctor! Great choice.

27:22.301 --> 27:25.127
I'm a big fan. Big fan.

27:25.138 --> 27:28.380
Oh, thank you.
But I do need to discuss...

27:28.391 --> 27:32.468
What was that terrific war picture,
you were in? What was that?

27:32.479 --> 27:35.888
Well, I've done a few.
The Way Ahead?

27:35.899 --> 27:39.351
Yeah! Hell of a picture.
You were sensational!

27:39.361 --> 27:41.186
Oh! Do you really think so?

27:41.196 --> 27:43.981
Oh, yes. Absolutely extraordinary.

27:43.992 --> 27:47.996
I did get some very nice notices.
Yes.

27:50.874 --> 27:53.617
Was that before or after
Brighton Rock?

27:53.628 --> 27:55.369
Oh, before...

27:55.379 --> 27:59.457
Of course!
You were in Brighton Rock! Wow!

27:59.468 --> 28:01.334
What a performance!

28:01.344 --> 28:04.546
Oh. Well. Ha-ha. You're very kind.

28:04.557 --> 28:08.717
It should have led to much bigger
and better things, you know,

28:08.727 --> 28:10.803
but, erm...I wasn't blessed.

28:10.814 --> 28:14.182
Not blessed? What the hell
are you talking about?

28:14.192 --> 28:17.895
Of course you're blessed. You're
going to be Doctor Who, aren't you?

28:17.906 --> 28:23.317
- Well, yes...
- Perfect choice for my little show.
My idea anyway.

28:23.328 --> 28:26.654
That's what I do. Ideas!
One day I came into ITV.

28:26.664 --> 28:28.073
"I got an idea," I said.

28:28.083 --> 28:31.075
"The Avengers!"
"What's it about?" they said.

28:31.086 --> 28:34.663
"How the hell should I know,"
I said. "But what a title!"

28:34.674 --> 28:35.758
Pop! Pop! Pop!

28:39.095 --> 28:44.174
You, sir, are going to make
a huge impact with this character.

28:44.185 --> 28:46.968
I am?

28:46.979 --> 28:50.806
Only a movie star could do it.
So nuanced.

28:50.817 --> 28:52.558
So many layers.

28:52.569 --> 28:57.355
Well, you know. One tries.

28:57.366 --> 29:00.150
And these kids are perfect for it.

29:00.160 --> 29:04.154
You couldn't be in safer hands.
Fun! Energy!

29:04.165 --> 29:05.875
Youth! Pop! Pop! Pop!

29:06.960 --> 29:08.336
Freaks.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.371
Thank you so much, Sydney.

29:11.381 --> 29:13.499
You've no idea
what a difference it makes...

29:13.509 --> 29:17.711
Be a producer, Verity.
Find a way to deal with this stuff.

29:17.721 --> 29:19.557
Or are you out of your depth?

29:40.998 --> 29:42.792
What are you doing?

29:46.379 --> 29:49.664
Being patient. What?
I can be very patient.

29:49.674 --> 29:53.043
- You can't stay here!
- Now, what shall we talk about?
I've got all day.

29:53.053 --> 29:55.087
Don't be ridiculous!

29:55.097 --> 29:59.717
The Old Curiosity Shop!
The Roman Forum!

29:59.727 --> 30:02.678
The Hanging Gardens Of Babylon!

30:02.688 --> 30:05.640
Symphonies in pencil and ink.

30:05.651 --> 30:09.697
So, surely you can turn your hand
to my teeny little time machine?

30:12.825 --> 30:16.069
Just turn that blazing talent
of yours to my little kiddies' show

30:16.079 --> 30:17.737
and who knows what might happen?

30:17.747 --> 30:19.457
Won't take you more than
half an hour.

30:20.918 --> 30:22.993
You are a very trying woman.

30:23.003 --> 30:25.297
Then I'll get out of your hair.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.005
Maybe the muse will be with you!

30:34.016 --> 30:38.479
Maybe it will be the best thing
you've ever thought of.

30:39.564 --> 30:42.024
Very well! Very well!

30:43.485 --> 30:45.477
Here. Here, madam.

30:45.487 --> 30:47.781
Here's your bloody TARDIS!

31:09.389 --> 31:11.381
Turned out rather well, hasn't it?

31:11.391 --> 31:13.967
Through the cupboard doors
and into Narnia!

31:13.977 --> 31:16.595
It's too bloody big.
Takes up half the studio.

31:16.606 --> 31:18.222
Yes, yes?

31:18.232 --> 31:20.724
Yes, yes, Waris, I heard him.
Thank you.

31:20.735 --> 31:24.020
Right. Can you pass me my script,
please?

31:24.030 --> 31:27.065
This is ridiculous!
Sorry, boys and girls.

31:27.075 --> 31:30.152
He says he won't have
his teeth blacked out, Guv.

31:30.162 --> 31:34.198
Dougie, it's 100,000 BC!
Yeah, I know.

31:34.209 --> 31:35.575
It's the Tribe Of Gum.

31:35.585 --> 31:37.827
He says he got them whitened
to get onto the telly.

31:37.837 --> 31:40.872
Well, does it matter?
We only see his bloody shadow.

31:40.883 --> 31:42.916
I'll do it! What?

31:42.926 --> 31:44.835
I don't mind blacking my teeth.

31:44.846 --> 31:47.963
I've already got sand fleas in my
Y-fronts. Can't get much worse.

31:47.974 --> 31:51.301
OK, stout man!
I think we're sorted then, Guv.

31:51.311 --> 31:52.927
Thank you, Duggie.

31:52.938 --> 31:54.846
Red light, bell...

31:54.856 --> 31:57.266
OK, into position, everyone,

31:57.276 --> 32:00.362
and roll to record in 15...

32:02.324 --> 32:05.452
God, it's hot in here.
Anyone else hot? Yeah.

32:06.954 --> 32:08.987
Can we do something about the heat?

32:08.998 --> 32:11.656
I thought he'd be used to it. What?

32:11.667 --> 32:15.077
Nothing. Watch it, Arthur.

32:15.088 --> 32:18.080
Five minutes, chum.
Then they turn the lights out.

32:18.091 --> 32:19.833
Them's the rules.

32:19.843 --> 32:21.793
OK, everyone. Quiet, please.

32:21.803 --> 32:23.346
Quiet!

32:24.390 --> 32:27.310
Five...four...three...

32:40.699 --> 32:44.986
OK, come in to camera one, on one.

32:44.996 --> 32:46.832
OK, clear two.

32:49.626 --> 32:53.329
These people are known to you,
I believe.

32:53.339 --> 32:55.080
What are you doing here?

32:55.091 --> 32:56.790
They're two of my schoolteachers.

32:56.801 --> 33:00.044
Is that your excuse for this
unwarrantable...

33:00.055 --> 33:02.380
Unwarranted intrusion?

33:02.390 --> 33:05.217
You had no right to invite them here.

33:05.227 --> 33:07.135
I blame you for this, Susan.

33:07.146 --> 33:09.013
You will insist on...
OK, come in on, er...

33:09.024 --> 33:10.398
Come in on three.

33:10.408 --> 33:12.433
- I warned you.
- But, Grandfather, I...

33:12.444 --> 33:15.354
- Is this really where you live, Susan?
- Yes!

33:15.364 --> 33:18.231
On three. Coming on one.

33:18.242 --> 33:19.649
It was just a box!

33:19.660 --> 33:22.069
On one, on three.

33:22.080 --> 33:23.247
Come in on two.

33:24.290 --> 33:27.158
You see, I knew this would happen.

33:27.169 --> 33:28.576
Move the camera.

33:28.587 --> 33:30.245
Get hold of the cable!
Get the cable!

33:30.255 --> 33:33.248
Move the bloody camera!
Arthur, what the hell is he doing?

33:33.259 --> 33:35.084
Why doesn't he have a go?

33:35.094 --> 33:38.379
Now we are here, I'd just like to...

33:38.390 --> 33:40.173
I know this is absurd, but...

33:41.768 --> 33:44.344
The doors!
What's happening to the doors?

33:44.355 --> 33:46.680
It moves. The TARDIS can go
anywhere.

33:46.690 --> 33:49.308
TARDIS? I don't know what
you mean, Susan.

33:49.319 --> 33:51.477
I made up TARDIS from the initials.

33:51.487 --> 33:55.273
Time And Relative Dimensions
In Space.

33:55.284 --> 33:57.651
I thought you'd both realise
when you came inside

33:57.661 --> 34:00.373
and saw the different
dimensions from outside.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.782
What's... What's happening to
the bloody doors?

34:03.793 --> 34:07.954
A thing that looks like a police
box, stuck in a junk yard,

34:07.964 --> 34:11.917
can move anywhere in time and space?

34:11.927 --> 34:14.293
Oh, Susan, don't be ridiculous!

34:14.304 --> 34:16.170
Oh, Christ,
stiff as Scotchman's wallet!

34:16.181 --> 34:18.632
But you are one of us.
You look like us.

34:18.643 --> 34:20.134
You sound like us.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.940
I was born in the 49th century.

34:27.444 --> 34:28.612
Oh...

34:32.116 --> 34:34.661
Covers! Get the covers!

34:36.371 --> 34:38.571
Everybody out.

34:38.581 --> 34:40.324
Am I on yet?

34:40.333 --> 34:42.034
Anyone?

34:42.043 --> 34:43.920
I've done me teeth.

34:45.507 --> 34:48.458
Wish I knew what bloody
dimension I was in.

34:48.467 --> 34:50.303
Hello?

34:51.304 --> 34:53.088
Hello?

34:53.098 --> 34:54.183
Anyone?

35:03.986 --> 35:07.438
TV: No, my child, we both know
we cannot let our secret loose

35:07.448 --> 35:09.523
into the world
of the 20th century.

35:09.534 --> 35:11.608
But you can't keep them
prisoner here!

35:11.619 --> 35:13.361
He can't keep us prisoners anywhere.

35:13.372 --> 35:15.738
I cannot let you go, schoolteacher.

35:15.749 --> 35:18.784
Whether you believe what you have
been told is of no importance.

35:18.794 --> 35:21.787
You and your companion would be
footprints in a time

35:21.797 --> 35:23.664
we were not supposed to walk.

35:23.674 --> 35:26.584
If I have to use force to get
out of here, I will, you know.

35:26.594 --> 35:29.587
Maybe we've stumbled on something
beyond our understanding.

35:29.597 --> 35:31.840
Oh, why did you come here, why?!

35:31.850 --> 35:33.466
Grandfather, no!

35:33.477 --> 35:35.427
No, you don't!

35:35.437 --> 35:37.555
Oh, stop it! Let him go!

35:37.565 --> 35:39.515
Let me go!

35:43.989 --> 35:45.657
Let's go to lunch.

36:02.343 --> 36:03.709
Not hungry?

36:03.720 --> 36:06.587
Don't seem to have much of
an appetite.

36:06.598 --> 36:07.890
Not surprised.

36:10.269 --> 36:12.677
I should fire the pair of you.

36:12.688 --> 36:16.943
Right. Take out the reference to
the future time they've come from.

36:17.944 --> 36:22.146
The 49th Century? Too specific.
It's Doctor Who, remember.

36:22.157 --> 36:26.276
And the old guy's too nasty.
He should be cuter. Funnier.

36:26.287 --> 36:30.197
And the kid needs to be cheeky too.
Like a regular teenager.

36:30.207 --> 36:31.866
Did you like any of it?

36:31.876 --> 36:35.119
Not much. Hate the opening titles.
You're joking?

36:35.130 --> 36:37.789
Too weird. It's sensational!
Just because it's new.

36:37.800 --> 36:41.512
Hey! Hey! I like new.
I do new, remember?!

36:43.222 --> 36:46.423
It's too scary for the kids.

36:46.434 --> 36:48.592
I-I thought we were trying
to scare them.

36:48.603 --> 36:52.347
Scare them, not traumatise them!
Change it.

36:52.357 --> 36:54.140
Over my dead body.

36:54.150 --> 36:55.611
It can be arranged.

37:01.409 --> 37:05.236
It'll cost. And they'll crucify me
for it.

37:05.246 --> 37:06.738
What?

37:06.749 --> 37:08.417
Do the whole thing again.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.539
I'm not right for the part.

37:15.550 --> 37:18.376
Bill... Just not right for it.
It... It isn't me. Bill!

37:18.387 --> 37:22.882
Isn't me at all! Listen to me.
Sydney thought it was good.

37:22.892 --> 37:25.353
He's over the moon! I let you down.

37:27.772 --> 37:29.733
You let me down?

37:32.193 --> 37:34.378
You were right. You were so right.

37:34.388 --> 37:36.688
Look, we've made the Doctor
too abrasive.

37:36.699 --> 37:38.457
We need much more of you in him.

37:38.867 --> 37:42.152
Much more charm and warmth
and twinkle.

37:42.162 --> 37:44.830
You knew it, I couldn't see it.

37:45.790 --> 37:47.573
You sure you've got the right man?

37:47.583 --> 37:49.168
Of course I am.

37:54.046 --> 37:55.955
I'm-I'm frightened, you see,

37:55.965 --> 38:01.584
I've...never really done
anything like this before.

38:01.594 --> 38:06.932
The...pressure, the schedule
and all those ruddy words...

38:09.267 --> 38:11.186
I'm here for you, Bill.

38:13.687 --> 38:15.314
Promise?

38:16.565 --> 38:17.899
Every step.

38:26.989 --> 38:28.324
Right...

38:31.494 --> 38:35.778
- I've got to tell the others now.
- Time and tide wait for no man, eh?

38:35.788 --> 38:39.750
Time and space, Bill.
And they wait for no woman either.

38:50.175 --> 38:51.457
I'm not hindering you.

38:51.468 --> 38:54.001
If you both want to make
fools of yourselves,

38:54.012 --> 38:56.211
I suggest you do what you
said you'd do.

38:56.221 --> 38:57.837
Go and find a policeman.

38:57.848 --> 39:01.341
Clear three, clear three.

39:01.351 --> 39:03.634
Move to shot two. Tighter on two.

39:03.644 --> 39:05.635
I shall be here when you get back.

39:05.646 --> 39:08.305
I want to see your faces
when you try and explain...

39:08.315 --> 39:09.763
Tighter on one.

39:09.774 --> 39:12.474
..Chesserman... Chesterton.

39:12.485 --> 39:14.601
He got the name wrong.
He got the name wrong.

39:14.612 --> 39:16.811
Can we go back? Can we go back?

39:16.821 --> 39:19.104
We've already stopped recording
three times.

39:19.115 --> 39:20.981
Only one more edit allowed, son.

39:20.992 --> 39:23.649
Thank you, Mervyn.
Four edits in the whole show!

39:23.660 --> 39:26.235
It's so bloody primitive!

39:26.246 --> 39:29.030
Young man speak truth!
BBC equipment from Stone Age!

39:29.040 --> 39:32.323
We have no choice, do we?
Onwards, Waris. Onwards!

39:32.334 --> 39:33.700
OK, stand by one

39:33.710 --> 39:35.618
Oh, no, Grandfather! No!

39:35.629 --> 39:38.672
Let me through.
Get back to the ship, child!

39:44.302 --> 39:47.461
It could be anywhere....
Dear, dear, dear, dear.

39:47.471 --> 39:49.212
It's of no help to us at all.

39:49.223 --> 39:53.974
I suggest before we go outside and
explore, let us clean ourselves up.

39:53.984 --> 39:56.687
- Oh, yes.
- What does the radiation read, Susan?

39:58.439 --> 40:00.523
It's reading normal, Grandfather.

40:12.033 --> 40:14.023
OK. Good.

40:14.034 --> 40:16.828
I'll tell them we can make
the transmission date.

40:20.622 --> 40:22.864
How are the other scripts
coming along?

40:22.875 --> 40:25.325
Your Canadian pal is doing us
one about Marco Polo.

40:25.335 --> 40:27.368
Terrific! That's more like my brief.

40:27.379 --> 40:29.369
Get the kids hooked on real history.

40:29.380 --> 40:32.456
We're also trying one of Tony
Hancock's writers - Terry Nation.

40:32.466 --> 40:33.540
You got a script?

40:33.550 --> 40:35.374
- Yes. It's good.
- What's it about?

40:35.384 --> 40:39.010
- Robots.
- No, no, no. They're not robots.

40:39.021 --> 40:41.021
Rule one - no robots!

40:41.098 --> 40:44.799
- Rule two...
- No bug-eyed monsters! I know.
But I promise you they're not.

40:44.809 --> 40:46.425
It's a really interesting story.

40:46.435 --> 40:48.969
Set on a distant planet after
a nuclear war...

40:48.980 --> 40:52.138
Okay, okay. Whatever.
Send it straight up to me.

40:52.148 --> 40:53.525
Then we'll see.

41:01.906 --> 41:05.649
This time in a few of weeks,
episode one will have aired.

41:05.659 --> 41:06.952
Hm.

41:08.787 --> 41:12.612
Brave heart, darling.
I think we'll be a smash.

41:12.623 --> 41:15.949
Fingers crossed.
We could do with a bit of luck.

41:27.719 --> 41:30.012
"Hideous machine-like creatures...

41:32.473 --> 41:36.465
"A lens on a flexible shaft...

41:36.476 --> 41:41.052
"acts as an eye...?

41:41.062 --> 41:47.682
"You will move ahead of us
and follow my directions!

41:47.693 --> 41:51.738
"Ian breaks away
and dashes for it...

41:57.159 --> 42:00.026
"Exterminate!"

42:00.037 --> 42:01.913
"Exterminate!"

42:09.419 --> 42:13.203
'It is with deep regret
that we announce

42:13.214 --> 42:15.747
'that President Kennedy is dead.

42:15.757 --> 42:19.250
'He was shot down as he was
driving in an open car

42:19.260 --> 42:22.378
'through the city of Dallas, Texas.

42:22.388 --> 42:27.882
'The identity of the assassin
remains unconfirmed at this time.'

42:42.029 --> 42:44.114
It was very good, Bill.

42:45.948 --> 42:48.190
'And now we return to the news.

42:48.200 --> 42:51.942
'Vice President Lyndon Johnson

'following the assassination
of John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Da...'

43:01.544 --> 43:03.630
They'll all be watching the news.

43:35.154 --> 43:38.188
She's way over budget.

43:38.199 --> 43:41.775
No, no - it's more than that.

43:41.786 --> 43:46.654
I'm afraid Miss Lambert
doesn't know what she's doing.

43:46.664 --> 43:51.908
First cavemen,
now these silly robots.

43:51.918 --> 43:53.951
What are you saying?

43:53.962 --> 43:56.870
That you're not to do any
more than these four episodes

43:56.880 --> 43:59.205
you've already got in production.

43:59.216 --> 44:01.958
Kill it, Sydney.

44:01.968 --> 44:03.844
Kill Doctor Who.

44:07.806 --> 44:10.673
In the village where I lived
down there...

44:10.683 --> 44:14.259
- Reviews were respectable.
- Uh-huh.

44:14.270 --> 44:16.345
Ratings too. Respectable.

44:16.355 --> 44:19.432
- Considering what happened.
- Mm.

44:23.277 --> 44:25.362
Sydney wants to see you, Verity.

44:46.629 --> 44:50.455
It's my fault.
I promoted you too soon.

44:50.466 --> 44:53.249
I don't much like the way
the show's going.

44:53.260 --> 44:55.542
First, goddamn cavemen...

44:55.553 --> 44:59.321
- No choice, the...
- And then these...Dayleks.
- Daleks.

44:59.331 --> 45:01.239
Exactly what I wanted to avoid.

45:01.249 --> 45:03.498
Cheapjack science fiction trash.

45:03.509 --> 45:04.825
- Have you read the script?
- Yes!

45:04.835 --> 45:07.544
- Really?
- Well, enough to know
garbage when I see it.

45:07.555 --> 45:09.960
- Jesus. Dorloks.
- Daleks!

45:09.995 --> 45:11.207
Whatever! Bug-eyed...

45:11.242 --> 45:13.891
They're not bug-eyed monsters!

45:13.901 --> 45:15.958
They used to be like us.

45:15.969 --> 45:18.266
Radiation has made them retreat

45:18.301 --> 45:20.205
inside these impregnable
metal shells,

45:20.240 --> 45:23.572
and now they hate
everything that isn't like them.

45:23.607 --> 45:25.743
All they know how to do is lash out.

45:25.778 --> 45:27.033
The Doctor and his friends turn up

45:27.068 --> 45:28.452
and try to make them
see differently.

45:28.663 --> 45:32.079
To understand other people
and make peace. It's good stuff!

45:32.114 --> 45:36.371
It's strong stuff, Sydney,
and I really, truly believe in it.

45:38.045 --> 45:42.481
Well, I wanted someone
with piss and vinegar.

45:44.967 --> 45:48.271
I think we've got something
really special here, Sydney.

45:49.180 --> 45:50.070
A knockout.

45:50.223 --> 45:53.075
We've just got to hold our nerve.

45:53.975 --> 45:55.184
Okay.

45:56.561 --> 45:58.260
Okay.

45:58.271 --> 46:00.429
I'll talk to the high-ups.

46:09.196 --> 46:11.556
- And I want a repeat.
- What?

46:11.656 --> 46:15.063
On Saturday. Repeat episode
one before episode two.

46:15.098 --> 46:19.277
- No-one was watching
because of the assassination.
- Oh, I see!

46:19.288 --> 46:20.986
This is Kennedy's fault?

46:20.997 --> 46:23.520
We deserve a fair
crack of the whip, Sydney.

46:24.917 --> 46:28.671
You'd better be right
about these...Daleks.

46:30.196 --> 46:32.705
Let me be very clear, young lady.

46:32.715 --> 46:35.008
Your neck's on the block.

46:44.624 --> 46:48.269
Come on, get a move on.
It's like a rabbit hutch in here.

46:51.396 --> 46:53.690
OK, are you nice and snug?

47:00.320 --> 47:01.697
What the hell's that?

47:04.740 --> 47:06.036
Monster for the next story.

47:07.377 --> 47:11.537
- What, a sink plunger
and an egg whisk?
- Oh, well.

47:11.572 --> 47:12.597
If they can't take over
the universe,

47:12.680 --> 47:14.642
might be able whip up
a decent omelet.

47:24.173 --> 47:28.975
Roll to record in 15, 14...

47:29.010 --> 47:30.485
Quiet, please, everyone.

47:30.495 --> 47:34.813
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

47:34.823 --> 47:38.591
six, five, four...

47:38.602 --> 47:40.175
Action!

47:43.522 --> 47:48.182
You will move ahead of us
and follow my directions.

47:48.192 --> 47:51.101
- 'On two.'
- Immediately!

47:51.111 --> 47:52.686
'Tighter on one.'

47:52.696 --> 47:54.697
No, tighter!

47:56.449 --> 47:57.992
Stand by, one.

48:00.161 --> 48:01.859
'On one.

48:01.870 --> 48:03.121
'Near three.

48:05.623 --> 48:07.125
'Stand by, two.

48:08.583 --> 48:11.492
- 'Two.'
- I said immediately!

48:11.503 --> 48:13.546
Fire!

48:16.131 --> 48:18.123
- My legs!
- On two.

48:18.133 --> 48:21.209
- My legs!
- Your legs are paralysed.

48:21.219 --> 48:28.840
You will recover shortly unless you
force us to use our weapons again.

48:28.850 --> 48:35.105
Well, everyone, meet the Daleks.
Gosh, they're creepy, aren't they?

48:36.856 --> 48:38.889
They're actually really creepy.

48:48.366 --> 48:51.190
Michael! Dennis!

48:51.201 --> 48:53.651
Your tea's getting cold.

48:53.662 --> 48:56.988
And that thing you wanted
to watch, it's on!

49:02.595 --> 49:07.329
Why? Because we weren't aware of
it until it was too late, that's why.

49:07.339 --> 49:10.415
<i>The truth is that your
supply of drugs has failed</i>

49:10.425 --> 49:14.126
and you came into the city to see
if you could find more.

49:14.136 --> 49:16.587
Thals? What are you talking about?

49:16.597 --> 49:19.381
We're not Thals, or
whatever you may call them.

49:19.391 --> 49:20.840
Can't you see we're very ill?

49:20.850 --> 49:26.928
- You and your companions
need a drug to stay alive.
- We have no gloves.

49:26.938 --> 49:28.137
Drugs.

49:28.148 --> 49:30.483
You said "gloves". Eh?

49:31.943 --> 49:35.643
Yes, yes. I...I did.

49:35.654 --> 49:40.867
Because the Daleks are nasty and you
need special gloves to touch them.

49:42.451 --> 49:44.776
Y-y-yes.

49:44.786 --> 49:49.415
Yes. You know things like that
because you're Doctor Who.

49:51.083 --> 49:52.793
That's...that's right.

50:02.134 --> 50:07.211
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate! Exterminate!

50:07.221 --> 50:11.088
Exterminate! Exterminate!
Exterminate! Exterminate!

50:11.099 --> 50:13.260
You will be my prisoner!

50:13.635 --> 50:17.427
You won't believe what I saw on the
bus this morning. It's...thrilling.

50:17.437 --> 50:19.314
Sydney wants you, Verity.

50:50.172 --> 50:52.925
Ten million viewers
for your bug-eyed monsters.

50:56.344 --> 50:58.221
Ten million.

51:01.139 --> 51:03.297
So...

51:03.308 --> 51:05.101
What do I know about anything?

51:08.312 --> 51:09.688
Well done, kid.

51:26.619 --> 51:30.778
A bus? What were you doing on a bus?

51:30.788 --> 51:33.197
Getting in touch with our audience.

51:33.207 --> 51:37.366
Our great, big, fat,
enormous bloody audience.

51:40.004 --> 51:42.079
Whoo-hoo!

51:51.263 --> 51:53.379
♪ Walking back to happiness

51:53.390 --> 51:55.798
♪ Woopah, oh, yeah-yeah

51:55.809 --> 51:58.008
♪ Said goodbye to loneliness... ♪

51:58.018 --> 52:01.636
Quickly, child! We're running
out of time! Check the fornicator!

52:01.647 --> 52:03.388
Fault locator.

52:04.524 --> 52:07.933
OK, I think we'd better
hold it there, please.

52:07.943 --> 52:09.903
First positions again.

52:14.824 --> 52:18.817
Verity. Verity! Look at this.

52:18.828 --> 52:21.193
Just look at this.

52:21.204 --> 52:22.653
General De Gaulle.

52:22.664 --> 52:24.263
"DeGaullek"!

52:24.274 --> 52:27.125
- That's wonderful!
- "No! No! No!"

52:29.169 --> 52:33.102
We've really got something here.
They love us.

52:37.801 --> 52:42.252
- Lovely stuff, this, you know.
- Shame it's not in colour.

52:42.262 --> 52:44.796
Come on, how much have I won?

52:44.807 --> 52:46.423
Ah...

52:46.433 --> 52:51.134
35 elephants, 4,000 white stallions,
25 tigers...

52:51.145 --> 52:53.345
And ten bob, you old devil.

52:53.355 --> 52:56.555
Right, make-up are nearly done
with Kublai Khan's digits,

52:56.566 --> 52:59.183
- so we'd best press on.
- What do you think?

53:00.611 --> 53:02.427
- Wow.
- Very swish.

53:02.437 --> 53:06.188
- Do you like it?
- Gorgeous, Carol.
I wonder if they'll let me buy it.

53:06.199 --> 53:09.535
- It'll turn a few heads
on the Kings Road.
- Oh, God.

53:10.994 --> 53:14.403
- Something the matter, Bill?
- You should be more careful, sweetheart,

53:14.414 --> 53:16.614
throwing your money around like that.

53:16.624 --> 53:19.065
It's an insecure
profession, you know.

53:19.076 --> 53:23.019
- We should all bear that in mind.
- Fancy anything at Newmarket, Bill?

53:23.054 --> 53:24.679
You know what I mean.
I'm just saying.

53:25.381 --> 53:27.524
Splashing out
on new togs all the time,

53:27.559 --> 53:28.905
you don't know you're bloody born!

53:28.940 --> 53:32.141
I'm not a child.
I'll spend it how I like.

53:37.391 --> 53:39.423
You're right, of course, Bill.

53:39.434 --> 53:41.542
None of us knows how long
this is going to last.

53:42.478 --> 53:43.907
No-one's irreplaceable.

54:04.463 --> 54:08.990
- Who told you that?
- Everyone mentions it.
So, you didn't go to RADA?

54:09.025 --> 54:13.410
- Roedean, darling.
- Eh?
- The girls' school.

54:13.587 --> 54:15.452
Must have been a typo on my CV.

54:15.463 --> 54:17.173
I've not got the heart
to tell Sydney.

54:17.423 --> 54:19.513
Bill, thank you so much
for the flowers.

54:21.301 --> 54:22.723
Sorry to see you go, son.

54:22.927 --> 54:27.443
- So, what's next for you?
- I've been offered A Passage To India.
- One-way?

54:28.015 --> 54:31.542
- Bill, I hope you never change.
- Bill, Bill, come on.

54:31.768 --> 54:35.396
- Quiet, please, everybody.
- Oh, yes.
- Bit of hush, ladies and gents.

54:37.606 --> 54:43.017
- Sure you won't stay?
Do some more with us?
- Pastures new.

54:43.027 --> 54:45.254
It's been a bloody blast, Verity.

54:45.404 --> 54:48.894
Couldn't have done it without you,
darling. Shoulder-to-shoulder.

54:59.665 --> 55:03.341
I saw you interfering with
some dials only last night,

55:03.376 --> 55:06.486
so I've decided to show you all
the things that you mustn't touch

55:06.521 --> 55:07.885
under any circumstances.

55:10.800 --> 55:15.960
Exterminate, exterminate!

55:15.970 --> 55:18.347
What the bloody hell?!

55:21.391 --> 55:24.144
Hello, my darling.

55:26.271 --> 55:27.854
What do you think?

55:30.065 --> 55:31.889
"Thrills galore.

55:31.900 --> 55:39.604
"Full-size, real-life Dalek playsuit
from the BBC TV series Doctor Who."

55:39.614 --> 55:43.398
Strike a light!
"Only 66 shillings and sixpence."

55:45.828 --> 55:48.944
And we have these. Goodness!

55:48.955 --> 55:51.363
Man and boy, I've been at this lark.

55:51.374 --> 55:54.210
But I've never known
anything like it.

55:55.418 --> 55:56.502
Incredible.

56:00.214 --> 56:02.257
No-one's irreplaceable, eh?

56:03.925 --> 56:06.500
So much for softly-softly.

56:06.511 --> 56:09.055
At this rate, you'll
be running the place.

56:14.601 --> 56:17.978
- "Dear Uncle Who."
- Uncle Who!

56:19.688 --> 56:22.263
"I've got my...

56:22.274 --> 56:26.767
"physics O-level coming up
and I need your help."

56:26.777 --> 56:30.103
I don't know why they
think I can help them.

56:30.114 --> 56:31.697
It's all gobbledygook to me.

56:34.033 --> 56:35.201
Please.

56:36.619 --> 56:39.829
Doctor Who, can I please
have your autograph?

56:41.664 --> 56:43.614
Now, then, what's this?

56:43.624 --> 56:47.992
- An autograph?
- Teacher said it would be all right.

56:48.002 --> 56:52.465
- Well, that must make you a
very special little boy, um...
- Alan.

57:02.097 --> 57:04.130
Thank you.

57:04.141 --> 57:08.018
Please, Doctor?

57:09.436 --> 57:13.722
Yes, what is it, um...
What is it, Alan?

57:13.732 --> 57:18.183
- Please, when are them Daleks coming back?
- Daleks?

57:18.194 --> 57:22.780
- They're taking over the ruddy world.
- It's what they do best, isn't it?

57:23.823 --> 57:25.981
Oh!

57:25.992 --> 57:28.660
Wow!
Oh, wow!

57:30.537 --> 57:31.996
Goodness me!

57:33.790 --> 57:39.461
Come along, come along. Keep up!
We must all get back to the TARDIS.

57:42.130 --> 57:43.703
What's this?
What's this?

57:43.714 --> 57:45.872
Look out! What?!
Look out! Run, run!

57:45.883 --> 57:49.959
Exterminate! Exterminate!

57:56.266 --> 57:57.934
Take three.

58:19.618 --> 58:21.067
Cut!

58:21.078 --> 58:25.363
Cut! Right, one more, please.
Quick as you can.

58:25.373 --> 58:28.490
Len,
you were nearly off the kerb.

58:28.500 --> 58:31.451
Why is it we always seem to have
to go again because of you?

58:31.461 --> 58:33.702
I need a wee, don't I?
You try being in here.

58:33.712 --> 58:37.539
Reset, let's go again!
It's not my fault!

58:37.549 --> 58:40.874
Bill. Bill, I thought
I might try something

58:40.885 --> 58:43.335
when I'm carrying you down the ramp.
What?

58:43.346 --> 58:46.421
I thought maybe
I just throw a look towards you,

58:46.432 --> 58:48.714
showing the Roboman's
inner turmoil.

58:48.725 --> 58:50.758
You know, I was a man once

58:50.768 --> 58:53.927
sort of thing, before the Daleks
made me like this.

58:53.938 --> 58:55.136
What do you think?

58:55.146 --> 58:58.097
- Don't be so bloody ridiculous.
- It was just a suggestion.

58:58.108 --> 59:00.516
Yes, well, stow it.

59:00.526 --> 59:02.944
- What's up with you?
- Mind your own business.

59:04.362 --> 59:05.780
Oi, Len! Over here!

59:08.783 --> 59:12.859
- It's not too late, you know.
- No, I've made up my mind.

59:12.869 --> 59:17.112
- They can rewrite this stuff in a shot.
- It's time to move on, Bill.

59:17.123 --> 59:20.699
- There's lots of other things I want to do.
- Well, of course.

59:20.709 --> 59:24.368
And there's more to life than
just screaming at nasty monsters.

59:24.378 --> 59:26.213
That's no way to talk about me.

59:36.639 --> 59:40.183
One day,
I shall come back.

59:41.476 --> 59:43.603
Yes, I shall come back.

59:46.063 --> 59:52.776
Until then, there must be
no regrets, no tears, no anxieties.

59:54.111 --> 59:59.439
Just go forward in all your
beliefs and prove to me

59:59.448 --> 01:00:02.034
that I am not mistaken in mine.

01:00:05.287 --> 01:00:06.829
Goodbye, Susan.

01:00:09.749 --> 01:00:11.083
Goodbye, my dear.

01:00:24.969 --> 01:00:27.764
That's lovely, Bill. Really lovely.

01:00:33.810 --> 01:00:35.769
Doesn't like farewells, does he?

01:00:42.526 --> 01:00:45.611
Just stepping off
for a minute, Waris.

01:00:59.205 --> 01:01:01.791
Waris?
He's been doing that a lot lately.

01:01:13.967 --> 01:01:17.001
That's it.
Look over towards Bill, Maureen.

01:01:17.012 --> 01:01:19.794
That's it. Smile over here, please.
Big smile!

01:01:19.805 --> 01:01:22.088
Cheers!

01:01:22.099 --> 01:01:24.174
Cheers!

01:01:24.184 --> 01:01:28.145
One more. One more!
Just look at Bill.

01:01:36.694 --> 01:01:39.519
You look all-in.

01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:41.145
Mm.

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:43.689
Come on, love. Why don't
you get your head down?

01:01:43.699 --> 01:01:45.899
We can go through this
in the morning.

01:01:45.910 --> 01:01:47.692
No, no. Got to get 'em in.

01:01:47.702 --> 01:01:49.662
Got to.

01:01:54.375 --> 01:01:57.992
Maybe it's time you
thought about moving on, love.

01:01:58.003 --> 01:01:59.452
Moving on?

01:01:59.462 --> 01:02:01.745
You're shattered all the time.

01:02:01.755 --> 01:02:05.665
I can't! Even if I wanted to.
They're all relying on me.

01:02:05.676 --> 01:02:10.627
Hundreds of people, aren't they?
And all those kiddies out there.

01:02:10.638 --> 01:02:18.978
You can't have Doctor Who without
Doctor Who, can you? Come on.

01:02:23.107 --> 01:02:26.734
Vortis? What galaxy is that in?

01:02:30.570 --> 01:02:32.770
It's the Isop Galaxy.

01:02:32.781 --> 01:02:36.190
The Isop Galaxy, Chesterton.

01:02:36.200 --> 01:02:41.580
It's many... Many.
..many...light years... Away...away.

01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:06.672
'He is becoming delirious.
I do not understand his words.'

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:11.896
'He is becoming delirious.
I do not understand his words.'

01:03:14.981 --> 01:03:20.226
Bill mustn't know I've spoken
to you. He'd play merry hell.

01:03:20.236 --> 01:03:21.987
What's the matter?

01:03:24.406 --> 01:03:26.241
Our GP rang.

01:03:27.367 --> 01:03:29.524
Bill's not very well.

01:03:29.535 --> 01:03:33.570
Oh, dear. Nothing serious?

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:38.156
Not in the short-term. It's, um...

01:03:38.167 --> 01:03:41.920
er...arteriosclerosis.

01:03:44.130 --> 01:03:48.832
It's a hardening of the arteries.

01:03:48.842 --> 01:03:51.135
I see.

01:03:57.349 --> 01:04:02.385
He smokes too much. Drinks too much.

01:04:02.395 --> 01:04:07.221
And these days, the only exercise
he gets is walking the dog.

01:04:07.232 --> 01:04:11.485
That, plus doing Doctor Who
virtually all year...

01:04:12.736 --> 01:04:14.811
Do you think he should stop?

01:04:14.821 --> 01:04:19.898
No. No, he couldn't bear that.
He loves the programme.

01:04:19.909 --> 01:04:23.860
He's so proud of it. And all of you.
You should hear him.

01:04:23.871 --> 01:04:25.778
But if there's anything you can do

01:04:25.788 --> 01:04:28.322
to lift the burden
from his shoulders,

01:04:28.332 --> 01:04:30.626
you know,
let him slow down a little.

01:04:33.753 --> 01:04:39.592
Well...I'll have a quiet word
with my successor.

01:04:41.468 --> 01:04:43.052
Oh.

01:04:45.179 --> 01:04:47.389
Oh. I see.

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:59.430
Vortis? What galaxy is that in?

01:04:59.441 --> 01:05:03.600
The Isop Galaxy, Chesterfield.
Chesterton!

01:05:03.611 --> 01:05:08.313
Many, many light earths...
light years...

01:05:08.323 --> 01:05:09.991
from us.

01:05:11.909 --> 01:05:17.445
From...from Earth.
And yet the...Vortis...

01:05:17.455 --> 01:05:19.749
Vortis planet hasn't a moon.

01:05:22.835 --> 01:05:25.795
Hm? Eh?

01:05:28.506 --> 01:05:30.705
Right, hold it there, please!

01:05:30.715 --> 01:05:34.876
All this stuff,
I can do it with a look.

01:05:34.886 --> 01:05:37.794
Bill, I really think we should stick
with what's on the page.

01:05:37.805 --> 01:05:41.214
Verity. I can do all this
with a look, you know.

01:05:41.224 --> 01:05:43.424
I don't need all these lines.

01:05:43.435 --> 01:05:45.926
It's like ruddy King Lear!

01:05:45.936 --> 01:05:48.678
I remember Lindsay Anderson saying
the same thing about me

01:05:48.689 --> 01:05:50.055
on Sporting Life.

01:05:50.065 --> 01:05:53.098
He just ripped a couple of pages
out of the script.

01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:55.976
"Bill can do all this
with a gesture," you see.

01:05:55.986 --> 01:05:58.656
"A raised eyebrow."
Do you see what I mean?

01:06:01.491 --> 01:06:03.367
Of course.

01:06:05.411 --> 01:06:07.568
Bless you.

01:06:07.579 --> 01:06:10.946
Actually, I'm glad to have the
chance to talk to you, Bill...

01:06:10.957 --> 01:06:13.573
You're my rock, Verity. Oh...
You know that. My rock.

01:06:13.583 --> 01:06:15.241
I don't know about that...

01:06:15.252 --> 01:06:18.703
Since that day you first started
telling me about Doctor Who,

01:06:18.713 --> 01:06:20.037
I've been spellbound.

01:06:20.048 --> 01:06:24.666
Spellbound! But look at us now, eh?
Just look at us!

01:06:24.676 --> 01:06:26.928
Our arses are in butter!

01:06:29.263 --> 01:06:31.724
What did you want to tell me?

01:06:34.351 --> 01:06:38.385
..Which, of course, was her way
of saying take a hike!

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:41.471
So, I am justifiably
proud of myself.

01:06:41.482 --> 01:06:44.390
I can spot talent light years away.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.476
Ladies and gentlemen, Verity.

01:06:47.486 --> 01:06:50.561
Best goddamn appointment
I've ever made.

01:06:53.032 --> 01:06:54.607
Verity!

01:06:54.617 --> 01:06:57.567
♪ For she's a jolly good fellow

01:06:57.577 --> 01:06:59.652

Not joining us?

01:07:30.438 --> 01:07:33.523
Perhaps in a minute.

01:07:50.454 --> 01:07:53.946
Bill, I wanted to say thank you.

01:07:53.956 --> 01:07:57.157
For everything you've done.

01:07:57.167 --> 01:08:00.952
- I'm in demand and it's all down to you.
- Oh, nonsense.

01:08:00.963 --> 01:08:04.163
In no small measure, Bill.
Doctor Who has made me.

01:08:04.173 --> 01:08:06.164
But why does it have to change?

01:08:06.175 --> 01:08:10.636
Why do things always have to change?
Why can't we just go on as we are?

01:08:15.307 --> 01:08:16.850
Life.

01:08:21.437 --> 01:08:25.013
What about you?
Not ready for a rest?

01:08:25.023 --> 01:08:28.015
Me? No. No. Not a bit.

01:08:28.026 --> 01:08:30.819
This old body of mine
is good for a few years yet!

01:08:33.196 --> 01:08:36.491
I'm going to miss all this.

01:08:41.787 --> 01:08:44.694
You've got, erm...

01:08:44.705 --> 01:08:46.238
Oh.

01:08:46.247 --> 01:08:47.500
Let me.

01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:00.468
What am I going to do without you?

01:09:18.233 --> 01:09:19.818
Till we meet again.

01:09:47.215 --> 01:09:48.955
That's it. Everybody ready?

01:09:48.965 --> 01:09:52.959
Smile! Mr Purves... Jackie...
Look at each other.

01:09:52.969 --> 01:09:56.753
That's it. Lovely!
Peter, give us a smile. Lovely.

01:09:56.763 --> 01:09:59.339
All right, when you're ready, Bill.

01:09:59.349 --> 01:10:02.383
Mr Hartnell to you, sonny.

01:10:02.394 --> 01:10:03.967
Sorry.

01:10:03.978 --> 01:10:06.928
You might call me by my first name
if we get to know each other better.

01:10:06.939 --> 01:10:10.650
If you...
if you last on my show, that is.

01:10:12.234 --> 01:10:15.185
Can we go from the top of the scene,
Mr Hartnell?

01:10:15.196 --> 01:10:17.937
You make the TV screen come on.
The scanner.

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.271
Scanner, right.

01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:22.858
And then you flick the switch
and the doors open.

01:10:22.868 --> 01:10:25.568
- No, no. Can't do that.
- Beg pardon?

01:10:25.578 --> 01:10:28.404
I'd have to move
round to the other side.

01:10:28.414 --> 01:10:30.739
That's where the door switch is.

01:10:30.750 --> 01:10:34.033
- Does it matter?
- Of course it matters!

01:10:34.044 --> 01:10:37.870
All right. We'll work around it.
You move where you like...

01:10:37.881 --> 01:10:40.288
- Mr Hartnell.
- Thank you. I will.

01:10:40.299 --> 01:10:42.676
Okay. Top of the scene, then.

01:10:45.512 --> 01:10:49.296
The glass cylinder
should be going up and down.

01:10:49.306 --> 01:10:53.393
- The ship is in flight.
- Right. Yes. Sorry.

01:10:58.981 --> 01:11:02.108
- Well?
- Sorry. Be right with you.

01:11:11.449 --> 01:11:13.524
Anybody know how to make it go?

01:11:13.534 --> 01:11:17.068
For Christ's sake! Doesn't anyone
know how to do anything?

01:11:17.078 --> 01:11:20.915
Out you go, out, out.
I'll sort it myself.

01:11:35.385 --> 01:11:38.544
Red light, and bell.

01:11:38.554 --> 01:11:41.088
Roll to record.

01:11:41.098 --> 01:11:44.632
In 15, 14...

01:11:44.642 --> 01:11:47.635
Quiet, please, everyone.

01:11:47.645 --> 01:11:51.189
OK, everyone ready? Ready now.

01:11:52.524 --> 01:11:54.765
There's a... Ten...

01:11:54.776 --> 01:11:57.434
..a lot of people
dancing about in my eyeline.

01:11:57.445 --> 01:12:02.240
It's very off-putting. Do you mind?
Thank you...five, four...

01:12:06.618 --> 01:12:10.497
Now...they've all gone.

01:12:12.582 --> 01:12:13.666
All gone.

01:12:16.752 --> 01:12:22.715
None of them ever understood.
Not even young Susan, or...

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:33.849
..or V-V-Vicki.

01:12:36.309 --> 01:12:41.761
And then there's Barbara
and Chatterton...

01:12:41.771 --> 01:12:43.513
Ch-Ch-Chesterton!

01:12:43.523 --> 01:12:45.233
Oh, God.

01:12:48.153 --> 01:12:51.697
Perhaps I should go back
to my own time.

01:12:53.448 --> 01:12:55.033
To my own planet.

01:12:57.826 --> 01:12:58.994
But I...

01:13:00.787 --> 01:13:02.164
I can't...

01:13:04.457 --> 01:13:05.958
I can't...

01:13:09.294 --> 01:13:10.993
Is everything okay?

01:13:11.003 --> 01:13:13.798
I, er...I can't...

01:13:14.882 --> 01:13:16.540
Are you all right?

01:13:16.550 --> 01:13:18.092
I...

01:13:19.886 --> 01:13:21.554
I can't...

01:13:27.642 --> 01:13:30.270
Mr Hartnell? I, er...

01:13:32.604 --> 01:13:34.773
Mr Hartnell?

01:13:50.536 --> 01:13:55.654
Anneke! Anneke, turn to me, love.
Turn to me. Thanks, love.

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:58.365
I could get used to this.
How about you?

01:13:58.376 --> 01:14:02.368
As you can see...
Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

01:14:02.378 --> 01:14:06.497
It can't go on. He's become
so difficult to work with.

01:14:06.507 --> 01:14:08.466
And his lines... I hear you!

01:14:10.385 --> 01:14:12.877
The poor man's worn out.

01:14:12.887 --> 01:14:16.181
Shame. Goddamn shame.

01:14:18.392 --> 01:14:21.978
- So, that's that, I suppose.
- What do you mean?

01:14:23.395 --> 01:14:27.024
Well, we can't have Doctor Who
without Doctor Who, can we?

01:14:42.161 --> 01:14:44.621
Pop, pop, pop.

01:14:49.542 --> 01:14:54.243
- Sampa! Sampa! Sampa!
- Oh, hello there.

01:14:54.254 --> 01:14:57.121
Where are you going to take
the TARDIS next, Sampa?

01:14:57.131 --> 01:14:58.955
Oh, I don't know, darling.

01:14:58.966 --> 01:15:01.958
Miss says you should go back in
time and see Oliver Cromwell

01:15:01.968 --> 01:15:04.252
and tell him not to be so horrible.

01:15:04.262 --> 01:15:05.794
Yes, maybe I should.

01:15:05.804 --> 01:15:08.964
But I want the butterfly men
to come back! They were pretty.

01:15:08.974 --> 01:15:11.216
We did them at school
and I was a Zarbi.

01:15:11.226 --> 01:15:14.218
Listen, Judi... They could have
a big fight with the Daleks

01:15:14.228 --> 01:15:17.554
and you could fly on their backs
with a bow and arrow.

01:15:17.564 --> 01:15:18.722
Listen, darling.

01:15:18.732 --> 01:15:22.057
You mustn't expect too much
from your old grandfather, you know.

01:15:22.068 --> 01:15:24.643
I get very tired
these days and, er...

01:15:24.654 --> 01:15:28.562
Graham Potter says the TARDIS
will run out of petrol soon.

01:15:28.573 --> 01:15:32.733
I need to take things a bit easier.
But I told him he was stupid.

01:15:32.743 --> 01:15:36.486
The TARDIS will go on and on for
ever because it's special and magic.

01:15:36.496 --> 01:15:38.988
- Like my Sampa.
-Well, I...

01:15:38.998 --> 01:15:42.376
My Sampa's Doctor Who
and he can do anything.

01:15:51.383 --> 01:15:54.417
I hope you don't think it
presumptuous of me

01:15:54.428 --> 01:15:56.543
to ask for this meeting, Sydney...

01:15:56.554 --> 01:15:58.795
Presumptuous?
Hell, no, Bill.

01:15:58.806 --> 01:16:03.768
- I was going to ask you to
come in, as it happens.
- Oh, yes?

01:16:05.019 --> 01:16:09.231
Yeah. Yeah. Things...

01:16:10.690 --> 01:16:13.401
Things can't go on the way they are.

01:16:17.237 --> 01:16:19.729
Exactly! Exactly, Sydney!

01:16:19.739 --> 01:16:23.910
I'm committed to Doctor Who,
100% committed, but...

01:16:26.370 --> 01:16:27.819
..well, I need more time off.

01:16:27.829 --> 01:16:31.613
Bloody schedule
would kill a man half my age.

01:16:31.624 --> 01:16:33.657
A-ha. All those lines they give me.

01:16:33.667 --> 01:16:36.743
The kiddies don't want
to hear all that waffle.

01:16:36.753 --> 01:16:41.330
But perhaps it would be best
if the writers just...

01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:46.542
sort of sketched in the story
and left me to make up the rest.

01:16:46.552 --> 01:16:49.670
No, no.
That's probably a step too far.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:54.632
But you take my meaning.
I'm the star of the show.

01:16:54.642 --> 01:16:55.883
I'm the Doctor.

01:16:55.893 --> 01:16:59.553
And, er, if we're to continue,
you have to take account of that.

01:16:59.564 --> 01:17:00.970
Proper account.

01:17:00.981 --> 01:17:04.807
We've got great plans for
Doctor Who, Bill, believe you me.

01:17:04.818 --> 01:17:06.517
Great plans. Well, I'm, er...

01:17:06.528 --> 01:17:09.269
We're 100% committed too.
Very glad to hear it.

01:17:09.279 --> 01:17:11.854
But we're looking at ways
of refreshing it.

01:17:11.865 --> 01:17:14.065
Um...regenerating it.

01:17:14.075 --> 01:17:17.984
Well, yes. Quite right.
Spice things up a bit. Bill...

01:17:17.995 --> 01:17:20.904
I'm glad we're on
the same wavelength anyway.

01:17:20.914 --> 01:17:25.334
Ah, hell, Bill, there's no
easy way of saying this. Um...

01:17:27.544 --> 01:17:30.035
We want Doctor Who to go on.

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:31.589
Yes.

01:17:33.132 --> 01:17:34.967
But not with you.

01:17:39.554 --> 01:17:43.557
Like you said,
things have got to change.

01:17:49.562 --> 01:17:50.687
I see.

01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:02.562
Who...who have you got in mind?

01:18:02.573 --> 01:18:05.105
You're a hard act to follow, Bill.

01:18:05.116 --> 01:18:08.734
No need for soft soap, Sydney.
You know me better.

01:18:08.744 --> 01:18:10.120
Who?

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:21.827
You approve?

01:18:21.838 --> 01:18:27.457
Oh, yes, yes, quite.
Patrick Troughton.

01:18:27.467 --> 01:18:29.803
Excellent choice.

01:18:33.972 --> 01:18:35.724
I'm so sorry, Bill.

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:48.307
"Fortune, good night,
smile once more, turn thy wheel."

01:18:48.317 --> 01:18:49.401
Huh?

01:18:50.653 --> 01:18:55.437
King Lear.
I did it once. Carried a spear.

01:18:55.448 --> 01:18:57.200
Long time ago.

01:18:58.909 --> 01:19:02.495
Long, long time ago.

01:19:26.849 --> 01:19:28.767
Everything all right, sir?

01:19:30.477 --> 01:19:32.186
Are you okay?

01:19:33.646 --> 01:19:36.847
You need to move along now, sir.

01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:40.474
Sir?

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:41.861
You're in the way.

01:19:43.946 --> 01:19:47.605
I'm sorry, sir, but...
'Ere, aren't you...?

01:19:47.615 --> 01:19:51.033
I'm, er, sorry, very sorry, officer.

01:19:51.143 --> 01:19:53.568
- You're him, aren't you?
- Very sorry, officer.

01:19:53.578 --> 01:19:55.163
You're Doctor Who.

01:19:57.457 --> 01:20:01.918
Wait till I tell the kids.
They bloomin' love you!

01:20:17.097 --> 01:20:21.299
Well, it's, er, been agreed by, um...

01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:26.564
by mutual consent that I should,
er...pack it in.

01:20:29.065 --> 01:20:30.765
Er...

01:20:30.775 --> 01:20:33.444
Oh, right. Give it up.

01:20:36.988 --> 01:20:38.365
I see.

01:20:48.748 --> 01:20:54.795
Well...I think it's for the best,
love. Truly, I do.

01:20:56.713 --> 01:20:59.955
You can't go on like this.

01:20:59.965 --> 01:21:04.583
And I've made my mark.
Shown everyone I can do it.

01:21:04.594 --> 01:21:09.254
I'm sure it'll lead to lots more
interesting stuff, hm?

01:21:09.265 --> 01:21:10.850
Yes.

01:21:22.233 --> 01:21:25.111
Well, I'll make us
a nice cup of tea.

01:21:27.738 --> 01:21:30.198
I...I...

01:21:32.033 --> 01:21:33.992
I don't want to go.

01:21:37.788 --> 01:21:41.582
I...I don't want to go.

01:21:45.336 --> 01:21:47.077
Oh...

01:21:47.087 --> 01:21:48.880
Oh, Bill.

01:22:11.857 --> 01:22:15.819
Well, then. Who's Who?

01:22:18.362 --> 01:22:21.396
I won't lie to you.
I'm scared stiff.

01:22:21.406 --> 01:22:24.982
Oh, you'll be fine.
In fact, you'll be wonderful.

01:22:24.992 --> 01:22:26.900
I...I told them, you know,

01:22:26.910 --> 01:22:29.903
there's only one man in England
who can take over.

01:22:29.913 --> 01:22:32.279
Oh? Couldn't they get him?

01:22:56.518 --> 01:22:58.978
Red light, and bell.

01:23:02.689 --> 01:23:10.112
Okay, positions, everyone, please.
And roll to record in 15...

01:25:01.035 --> 01:25:05.953
'I want you to belong somewhere,
to have roots of your own.

01:25:05.964 --> 01:25:08.448
'With David, you'll be able
to find those roots,

01:25:08.458 --> 01:25:11.366
'live normally,
like any woman should do.

01:25:11.376 --> 01:25:15.662
'Believe me, my dear,
your future lies with David

01:25:15.672 --> 01:25:19.081
'and not with a silly old buffer
like me.

01:25:19.091 --> 01:25:24.918
'One day, I shall come back.
Yes, I shall come back.

01:25:24.929 --> 01:25:31.424
'Until then, there must be
no regrets, no tears, no anxieties.

01:25:31.434 --> 01:25:34.093
'Just go forward in all your beliefs

01:25:34.103 --> 01:25:38.850
'and prove to me
that I am not mistaken in mine.'
