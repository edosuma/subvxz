Okay, yeah, Dad, just press the circle.
Just once. Just press it--

00:27.958 --> 00:30.166
-Okay, wait, tell me when we're going.

00:30.250 --> 00:31.833
-Okay. All right.
-Okay. Ready?

00:32.333 --> 00:36.125
Okay. I know I have
some things to clear up, so…

00:37.625 --> 00:39.833
I thought this is gonna be the best way.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.875
If you don't like what I'm saying,
don't write in the comments

00:43.958 --> 00:47.041
because I will not read it
and will not even care.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.791
Okay, here we go.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.625


00:51.708 --> 00:55.333
When I moved to the US,
I knew fitting in was gonna be hard.

00:56.041 --> 00:59.625
I just didn't know
how bloody hard it was going to be.

00:59.708 --> 01:02.625
And all I wanted was to get invited
to the coolest club in town,

01:03.458 --> 01:04.875
Rock 'N' Bowl.

01:04.958 --> 01:06.458
But I never was.

01:06.541 --> 01:10.458
Anyone who was anyone was rolling
with their homies on a Saturday night.

01:10.541 --> 01:14.666
It was like basically a VMAs after-party.

01:15.166 --> 01:19.916
So when I turned 14, uh, yeah,
that's where I had my birthday.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.125
-Ah! It's an alien baby.
-Ew!

01:23.208 --> 01:27.125
That's gonna make me sick.
I think I'm gonna shit fireballs.

01:27.208 --> 01:30.708
Being there made me feel cool
for the first time in my life.

01:30.791 --> 01:31.833
Steph, you do one.

01:31.916 --> 01:34.083
I felt like
the kids I wanted to be.

01:34.166 --> 01:38.125

Ooh, ooh.

02:03.375 --> 02:05.541
Cute that in Australia
you call it a party,

02:05.625 --> 02:09.208
'cause in America,
we call that a freak show.

02:09.291 --> 02:13.208
Well, um, it's actually not a freak show
'cause we have cake, so…

02:13.750 --> 02:14.750
Let's go.

02:15.625 --> 02:18.500
God, I just wanted
to be like them so bad.

02:18.583 --> 02:21.375
If they were this amazing in high school,

02:21.458 --> 02:24.166
imagine how perfect
the rest of their lives would be.

I wanna take more photos.

02:33.208 --> 02:34.583
You are too much.

02:34.666 --> 02:38.791
Guys! Could we just, like, try to be cool
for once?

02:41.291 --> 02:44.041
I hated thinking
that life wasn't for me…

02:47.083 --> 02:48.333
that I was destined to be

02:48.416 --> 02:53.666
just some average, boring, invisible girl
who had no friends.

02:53.750 --> 02:57.000
In Australia, we call that a Nigel,
but whatever.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.625
You guys know what I mean.

03:00.666 --> 03:02.416
I wanted to be something more.

03:04.208 --> 03:05.875
And that's when I decided…

03:08.125 --> 03:10.625
…that's it.
I'm gonna become popular.

03:11.416 --> 03:13.708
I know your favorite is
"I Want It That Way,"

03:13.791 --> 03:15.041
but it's my favorite too.

03:15.541 --> 03:16.791
Oh my God!

03:16.875 --> 03:21.208
Okay, I Darrin Dance Groove'd my ass off
and became captain of the cheer squad.

03:21.291 --> 03:24.500
I got so many new friends,
I didn't even know some of their names.

03:24.583 --> 03:27.375
But like, of course,
I would always smile at them.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.125
And, oh my God, before I knew it,
I had the hottest boyfriend in school.

03:32.208 --> 03:36.500

Just like, mega hot.

05:17.458 --> 05:20.083

in that empty store next to Wet Seal

05:20.166 --> 05:23.458
that they were holding, like, groups
for widows and widowers.

05:23.541 --> 05:24.916
Looked pretty jumping.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.250
You're a catch, Mr. Conway.
A sad woman would totally go out with you.

05:28.875 --> 05:32.583
I'll tell you what, I'll ask somebody out
when you do, Seth.

05:32.666 --> 05:33.875
Yeah.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.791
Did you hear
Tiffany went behind my back

05:35.875 --> 05:37.166
and got the Activities Committee

05:37.250 --> 05:40.875
to make the prom king and queen song
"Wherever You Will Go" by The Calling?

05:40.958 --> 05:44.833
Uh, no. You know, that piece of gossip
hasn't really trickled down to me yet.

05:44.916 --> 05:47.666
Well, when it gets to you,
believe it.

05:48.166 --> 05:49.708

like "Power of Love."

get my crown, get glitter-rained on

and then dance to
"Wherever You Will F-ing--"

and prom queen '95.

06:10.291 --> 06:11.833
Bangin' bod.

06:11.916 --> 06:15.041

with a famously girthy dong.

06:24.625 --> 06:25.583

prom is coming up,

07:00.625 --> 07:03.125

07:03.208 --> 07:04.708
I know it's a long shot, but--

07:04.791 --> 07:08.083
Seth, you don't even have
to finish the question.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.750
-The answer's yes.
-Wait, really? What about Blaine?

07:11.833 --> 07:15.458
Ah, he'll understand. It wouldn't feel
right to spend prom without you.

07:16.041 --> 07:16.916
Seth,

07:17.791 --> 07:21.583
I would love for you to come
to my after-prom party.

07:22.791 --> 07:25.416
Oh, wow. Yeah, cool.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.250
-Thanks, Steph.
-Oh my God. Duh, no prob.

07:28.333 --> 07:30.333
Oh, also, there's gonna be a VIP room,

07:30.416 --> 07:32.916

I mean it.

07:33.000 --> 07:33.833
Fun.

07:33.916 --> 07:37.625
Okay, um, I'm gonna let you out here
because I got to make my entrance.

07:37.708 --> 07:40.666
Oh, also, I need that sock back.
It's Blaine's.

07:41.291 --> 07:42.875

08:55.208 --> 08:56.750
Don't lose these. I'm serious.

If my parents find out I gave you
the keys to our lake house for a party,

08:59.750 --> 09:02.375

09:12.958 --> 09:15.791
Did you just invite me
to a party that's at my own house?

09:15.875 --> 09:18.458
Of course not.
I'm inviting you to the VIP section.

09:18.541 --> 09:20.916
Seth will be there too.
So you'll have someone to talk to.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.500
Right. I could also talk to you.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.708
Right, yeah, duh.

09:26.791 --> 09:30.416
Um, except I'm probably gonna be losing
my bottom half virginity to Blaine.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.875
So I'll be, like, in and out.

09:32.833 --> 09:35.541
So will Blaine, literally.
You know what I mean?

09:35.625 --> 09:38.666
Also, Martha, it's pep rally day.
Why aren't you in your cheer uniform?

09:40.375 --> 09:42.208

09:42.291 --> 09:44.833

-Okay. Yeah.

09:47.041 --> 09:49.166
-Okay. I'll see you later. Bye!
-Bye.

09:53.166 --> 09:57.166
So, I've been telling everyone
about the VIP section at our party,

09:57.250 --> 09:59.291
but here's a little secret.

09:59.791 --> 10:04.208
There's gonna be
a VIP VIP section just for us.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.125
For boning.

10:09.250 --> 10:11.416
Mmm, so, uh, about that,

10:11.500 --> 10:15.583
um, most of the football team's already
said yes to going to a different party.

10:15.666 --> 10:17.791
But this one has
a heated pool and a live band.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.958
What? Whose party?

10:20.541 --> 10:22.833
Tiff's. But we could bone there,
if you want.

10:24.791 --> 10:27.833
What the slut?

10:27.916 --> 10:30.000
Get back to your seat, Miss Conway.

10:30.083 --> 10:34.583
I would like to start my class
before the next millennium hits.

10:35.958 --> 10:38.375
-Can I go to the bathroom?
-Fine.

10:38.458 --> 10:39.791
Dex, wait.

10:45.333 --> 10:47.458
Get this to Tiffany,

10:48.708 --> 10:49.541
now.

10:50.666 --> 10:52.666
Would you turn your books to the…

11:01.625 --> 11:03.083
Got your note.

11:05.458 --> 11:09.958
For the last time, Tiffany,
I won cheer captain fair and square,

11:10.041 --> 11:13.875
and you and Blaine were broken up
when we got together. I don't cheat.

11:13.958 --> 11:19.083
So why do you continue
to be the butt-roids on my… butt?

11:19.166 --> 11:21.041
I don't know what you're talking about.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.625
First, you changed
the prom king and queen song.

11:23.708 --> 11:25.291
Now you're throwing an after-prom party

11:25.375 --> 11:27.666
when you know
I've been planning mine for months.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.166
You mean the one you have to throw
at Barfa's family lake house

11:30.250 --> 11:31.416
'cause you live in a shanty.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.083
Her name is Martha,

11:34.166 --> 11:37.375
and she hasn't thrown up on herself
since the eighth grade, so…

11:38.625 --> 11:40.291
-Cancel your party!
-Sorry.

11:40.375 --> 11:43.000
My daddy has already paid
for the caterers.

11:43.083 --> 11:47.791
Open bar, Jäger,
Mike's Hard Lemonade, Smirnoff Ice.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.208
All the good shit.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.833
So, you cancel yours.

11:53.916 --> 11:56.541
You won't wanna throw a party
after I beat you for prom queen.

11:57.958 --> 11:59.916
What makes you think
you're gonna win?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.375
'Cause I'm MTV, and you're VH1.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.791
I'm the real deal, and you're a poser.

12:04.875 --> 12:08.625
You think you can shimmy your koala ass
to the top of the food chain I created

12:08.708 --> 12:10.500
and screw up my senior year?

12:10.583 --> 12:13.125
You're just a poor spaz playing dress up.

12:15.041 --> 12:16.750
Don't go chasing waterfalls.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.041
Take that back.

12:28.333 --> 12:31.333
-Freshmen suck!

12:31.416 --> 12:33.875
-Freshmen suck!
-Freshmen suck!

12:33.958 --> 12:35.666
-Freshman suck!
-Settle down.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.750
Blaine, settle down. Settle down.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.125
Listen.

12:40.666 --> 12:44.875
We have less than a month of school left.
Let's all just get through it.

12:45.458 --> 12:47.333
-Now I know you all…
-All right, sluts.

12:47.416 --> 12:49.291
Everybody, listen up.

12:49.375 --> 12:51.166
Listen to Martha.

12:51.250 --> 12:53.500
Just a couple notes
before we get out there.

12:53.583 --> 12:54.958
We replaced the spotlight operators

12:55.041 --> 12:56.833
with kids tall enough
to see what's going on.

12:56.916 --> 12:59.791
Try not to hit the ground too hard
so our CD doesn't skip.

12:59.875 --> 13:00.833
"Our CD"?

13:00.916 --> 13:05.916
I'm sorry, since when does a clipboard
and a windbreaker make you a Bulldogette?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.083
Since I appointed her
equipment manager, Tiffany.

13:09.166 --> 13:11.291
Do you have any idea
how much she does for us?

13:11.375 --> 13:14.000
Without her, we'd fall apart.
Whereas without you, Tiff,

13:14.083 --> 13:16.958
we'd, I don't know,
have less stains on our uniform

13:17.041 --> 13:20.041
-from catching your spray-tanned ass.

13:20.125 --> 13:21.125
Continue, Marth.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.708
Oh, I was done.

13:23.291 --> 13:24.208
Oh.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.625
All right, biatches. When I started
choreographing this routine,

13:27.708 --> 13:30.875
I knew it had to be more
than just a regular cheer,

13:30.958 --> 13:34.458
which is why I made this,

13:34.541 --> 13:36.750
a step-by-step guide to our routine

13:36.833 --> 13:41.541
so that future squads will be able
to replicate our VMA-level performance.

13:42.541 --> 13:46.041
Martha, please see
that this gets into the school archives

13:46.125 --> 13:48.083
so that our legends will live on.

13:49.083 --> 13:51.458
-Do we have a school archive?
-We do now.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.666
All right, places, skanks!

13:55.041 --> 13:56.166
Twins?

13:56.958 --> 13:57.875
Can we talk?

13:57.958 --> 14:00.250
And speaking of "not school appropriate,"

14:00.333 --> 14:04.833

Oh! And hey,
all you high school seniors out there,

16:00.541 --> 16:03.125
who doesn't want a Hummer
on their big night. Am I right?

16:03.208 --> 16:08.291

We're ready for prom. Are you?

16:15.875 --> 16:17.250
I'm ready for prom.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.458
What the slut?

16:38.208 --> 16:39.958
Oh, hi.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.375
Hi. Hello. Hi.

16:42.458 --> 16:44.666
Excuse me. Um, I'm not sure what happened,

16:44.750 --> 16:48.166
but I think there's been a mistake,
and I've been put in the wrong room

16:48.250 --> 16:52.166
'cause there's a bunch of birthday cards
for, like, a really old person.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.708
And the TV's flat,
like the back of it is missing,

16:54.791 --> 16:57.166
and I really need to see
who's number one on TRL.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.250
Dr. Johnson to the third floor.
The cheerleader just woke up.

17:00.333 --> 17:03.583
Oh, I don't mean to be a bitch,
but "cheer captain."

17:04.083 --> 17:05.166
Cheer captain.

17:05.250 --> 17:09.333
And do you have any Von Dutch jeans?
'Cause this is, like, really unflattering.

17:09.416 --> 17:10.416
Oh crap.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.125
What are you staring at?

17:13.791 --> 17:16.958
Hello? It's very rude to be a stare bear.

17:18.291 --> 17:21.333
Hello? Are you-- Stop… stop doing that!

17:21.416 --> 17:23.250
Why are you doing that, you freaky old--

17:33.791 --> 17:35.416
And the cheerleader's back down.

17:35.916 --> 17:38.125
Oh, cheer captain. Are you okay?

17:39.666 --> 17:41.750
This defies scientific explanation.

17:41.833 --> 17:42.916
Being this hot?

17:43.833 --> 17:44.666
No.

17:44.750 --> 17:46.916
Stephanie, it's 2022.

17:49.250 --> 17:50.375
No way.

17:50.458 --> 17:51.500
Mm-hmm.

17:51.583 --> 17:54.750
Are you sure I haven't been
Freaky Friday'd into some old lady's body?

17:54.833 --> 17:57.541
You've been in a coma
for almost two decades.

17:58.916 --> 18:00.583
That doesn't sound right.

18:00.666 --> 18:03.916
I know this is a lot to process,
but we'll just take this nice and slow.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.125
-Stephie?
-Stephanie!

18:05.208 --> 18:06.291
-Oh my God.
-Stephanie!

18:06.375 --> 18:09.875
Stephie, I can't believe this!
It's me. It's Dad!

18:10.916 --> 18:14.208
Oh my God!

18:14.291 --> 18:15.666
-Dad?
-Yeah!

18:15.750 --> 18:19.333
How about me? Do you remember?
It's Martha, Martha Riser.

18:19.416 --> 18:21.166
I never thought
I'd have this moment again.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.250
I was this close to freezing you.

18:23.333 --> 18:24.208
What do you mean, Dad?

18:24.291 --> 18:27.333
Don't worry. I couldn't afford it.
I was only gonna freeze your head.

18:27.416 --> 18:29.541
-No!
-We'll have to be gentle.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.000
Physically she's aged,
but mentally she's still 17.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.625
Of course. Yes, I see
how we came in a little hot.

18:34.708 --> 18:35.541
Yeah.

18:35.625 --> 18:38.500
Martha, you look like
an Ally McBeal character.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.250
Oh my God. Thank you.

18:40.750 --> 18:44.000
Well, the good news is
nothing abnormal came up in her tests.

18:44.083 --> 18:47.708
Stephanie, your physical
and mental resilience are remarkable.

18:47.791 --> 18:48.958
Uh, let… let's go home.

18:56.166 --> 18:59.166
Marth, oh my God, what is that, a tiny TV?

18:59.250 --> 19:02.250
No. No, Steph,
this is my cell phone.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.875
Oh my God. Whoa! Really?

19:04.958 --> 19:07.125
-That is very cool.

19:07.208 --> 19:10.625
I always knew you'd be some high-powered,
Sex and the City businesswoman.

19:10.708 --> 19:12.625
-Total Miranda, right, Dad?
-Oh…

19:13.625 --> 19:17.250
I'm actually
a high school principal at Harding.

19:17.333 --> 19:21.416
Oh my God, you still got
a good sense of humor.

19:26.458 --> 19:32.291
That's… I mean, that's actually
a very cool and important job.

19:32.375 --> 19:35.000
-So, whoo!

19:35.875 --> 19:38.041
Um, and they give you
a fancy cell phone for that?

19:38.125 --> 19:40.000
Oh, they're common now. Even I have one.

19:40.083 --> 19:40.916
Oh. Okay.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.208
They do much more than just call people.
You could also watch the news.

19:44.291 --> 19:46.875
Look, here's a news story
about you right now.

19:46.958 --> 19:50.791
-What? No. Oh, about me? No, oh my God.
-Yeah, it's you!

19:50.875 --> 19:52.000
Okay, wait, show me.

19:52.083 --> 19:56.416
Video edits of her infamous accident
went immediately viral on Instagram…

19:56.500 --> 20:00.041
Oh my God.
I went down like a bag of dicks.

20:00.791 --> 20:01.875
Oh.

20:01.958 --> 20:03.458
-Stephie!
-Wait. What does "viral" mean?

20:03.541 --> 20:06.875
Well, "viral" just means everybody saw it.

20:06.958 --> 20:09.583
Everybody's seen that?
I look retarded in those videos.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.666
Now, Steph,
you… you cannot say the R-word anymore.

20:12.750 --> 20:14.375
-What? Really? Why?
-Mm-mm.

20:14.458 --> 20:17.291
Because it's offensive
to people with intellectual disabilities.

20:17.375 --> 20:20.958
But what if something
really is, like, "R-word,"

20:21.750 --> 20:24.666
um, what do you call it?
Like, "super gay"?

20:24.750 --> 20:28.458
No, no. You can't call things "gay"
anymore, either,

20:28.541 --> 20:31.958
unless you use it
as a neutral-positive term

20:32.041 --> 20:34.625
to refer to somebody
who identifies as homosexual.

20:34.708 --> 20:37.500
-So you cannot say the "R-word."
-Right.

20:37.583 --> 20:38.541
And, um…

20:38.625 --> 20:39.958
Sorry. Coma brain.

20:40.041 --> 20:42.083
-What was the other word you can't say?
-"Gay."

20:42.166 --> 20:43.291
Ha! Made you say it.

20:45.625 --> 20:47.041
-Stephie.
-I-- That's…

20:47.125 --> 20:48.791
-Still got it, Dad.
-You do.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.416
Dad, um, can you take a left up here?

20:51.500 --> 20:52.625
-Oh.
-To see--

20:52.708 --> 20:56.291
No, no, no. No, um,
actually, you should get home and rest.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.833
Rest? I've been asleep for 20 years.

20:58.916 --> 21:01.458
-Dad, just take this left here.
-Jim, don't take the left.

21:01.541 --> 21:03.083
Is there-- I don't understand…

21:03.166 --> 21:05.291
-Indicator. Indicate left.
-Do not. Do not.

21:06.291 --> 21:09.750
-Thank God, it's still the same.
-Yep. There it is. Let's keep going.

21:10.291 --> 21:11.916
That's not Deanna Russo's husband.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.375
-Who is that?
-Um…

21:13.458 --> 21:16.541
Oh my God.
I know that ass anywhere. That's Blaine.

21:16.625 --> 21:20.916
Wait. Did he get me my dream house?
Stop the car! Why didn't you say anything?

21:21.000 --> 21:23.916
-Don't stop the car.
-What are you talking about? Stop the car!

21:24.000 --> 21:25.916
Don't stop the car.
No. He's probably sleeping.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.125
-He walked into the house.
-You don't wanna wake him.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.291
He looked tired!

21:29.375 --> 21:32.041
-I don't know what to do. Ah!
-Just stop the car!

21:32.125 --> 21:33.333
-No!

21:51.750 --> 21:53.083
Oh. You know what?

21:53.166 --> 21:55.666
Someone from the shelter
already came by yesterday

21:55.750 --> 21:59.208
to pick up our donations, so…
Thank you though.

21:59.291 --> 22:00.291
Tiffany?

22:01.458 --> 22:04.041
Shut up!

22:04.708 --> 22:06.083
Stephanie?

22:06.166 --> 22:09.916
-Oh my God, look at you!

22:10.000 --> 22:12.666
-I can't believe this.
-What is happening?

22:12.750 --> 22:15.208
I have so many things I… I want to say.

22:15.291 --> 22:17.916
I've always felt terrible
about what happened.

22:18.000 --> 22:20.500
I can't believe
you didn't land that stunt.

22:20.583 --> 22:24.333
Wait, why are you living here with Blaine?
I don't get it.

22:24.416 --> 22:26.375
This is mine and Blaine's dream house, so…

22:26.458 --> 22:29.041
-Well, actually--
-Why are you here?

22:29.125 --> 22:30.625
It's a long story.

22:30.708 --> 22:33.625
Our parents got it for us
as a wedding gift and…

22:33.708 --> 22:36.250
Well, that's it. The end.

22:36.333 --> 22:37.791
No, you shut your face.

22:37.875 --> 22:41.000
Um, where's Blaine?
Just get me Blaine, and, um--

22:41.083 --> 22:44.041
I'm so sorry.
He is just so swamped right now with work.

22:44.125 --> 22:45.000
Oh.

22:45.500 --> 22:46.916
I see what you did here.

22:47.625 --> 22:50.041
Get rid of me
so you can steal my dream life.

22:50.125 --> 22:52.000
Oh…

22:52.708 --> 22:53.791
Steph.

22:53.875 --> 22:55.333
-No, no.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.041
Look, I know
we never saw eye-to-eye back then,

22:58.125 --> 23:01.083
but you know, the beautiful thing
about time is you move on.

23:02.166 --> 23:07.291
Okay, you know what? I need to go
because I am brining zucchini ribbons,

23:07.375 --> 23:10.041
but I never let a guest leave
without a gift.

23:10.125 --> 23:13.041
Um, so I'm just gonna give you…

23:13.125 --> 23:14.250
-What?
-Here.

23:14.333 --> 23:17.208
Homemade from my own starter.
A peace offering.

23:17.291 --> 23:21.166
I really look forward
to putting the past behind us.

23:21.750 --> 23:25.208
You know, move past the past.

23:26.041 --> 23:29.625
So, maybe when you're feeling better
and a little bit more stable,

23:29.708 --> 23:31.125
we could do brunch sometime.

23:31.208 --> 23:33.041
-Blaine!
-It's great to see you!

23:33.125 --> 23:34.125
Blaine!

23:36.208 --> 23:39.375
-Come on, come on, come on, come on.

23:41.458 --> 23:42.833
Who's that at the door?

23:42.916 --> 23:46.333
It was… Stephanie Conway.

23:50.000 --> 23:51.041
She's awake?

23:57.083 --> 23:58.125
Ah, yes.

24:00.833 --> 24:02.541
Perfectly preserved.

24:04.458 --> 24:06.916
-And here we are.

24:07.000 --> 24:09.458
Oh!
Did she not wear her seat belt?

24:09.541 --> 24:10.791
I don't think she did.

24:10.875 --> 24:12.375
-Oh God.

24:12.458 --> 24:14.791
-It's locked, hon.
-Dad!

24:14.875 --> 24:16.541
Here we are. Yeah.

24:16.625 --> 24:17.458
Hey, S…

24:19.791 --> 24:20.625
She's…

24:28.458 --> 24:30.166
Oh my God.

24:31.041 --> 24:33.000
Didn't have the heart to change it.

24:33.083 --> 24:37.458
Kept your Cabriolet too. You know me,
never very good at letting things go.

24:45.458 --> 24:48.958
I… I also never, uh, canceled
any of your magazine subscriptions.

24:49.041 --> 24:52.083
Wait, Madonna's now called Lady Gaga?

24:54.000 --> 24:54.833
-No.
-No.

24:54.916 --> 24:58.208
-But she looks exactly like Madonna.
-You've had a lot to digest today.

24:58.291 --> 24:59.833
We'll get you caught up this weekend.

25:01.750 --> 25:02.833
Dad!

25:06.458 --> 25:08.875
Dad. What the F?

25:09.458 --> 25:12.708
Who was in charge of my feeding tube?
My boobs are huge.

25:13.541 --> 25:16.000
Well, you… you're just getting older.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.916
You know, bodies change,

25:18.000 --> 25:21.166
and pretty soon,
you'll go through menopause.

25:21.250 --> 25:22.875
Oh my God. Don't.

25:24.375 --> 25:25.750
I can't do this.

25:27.750 --> 25:30.250
I was so close to having my dream life.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.125
You still can, sweetie.

25:32.208 --> 25:34.291
I can't. Look at this.

25:34.375 --> 25:36.166
-Well--

25:36.250 --> 25:39.083
-If anyone can do it, it's you.

25:39.166 --> 25:41.791
Oh, Dad, shut up. I'll get it.

25:41.875 --> 25:42.958
Dad…

25:43.041 --> 25:44.875

-Um, I just need your help with something.
-Uh…

29:59.625 --> 30:00.916
I want to go back to school.

30:01.708 --> 30:02.916
Oh, Steph.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.416
That's wonderful. Yes, of course.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.416
I can get you some info on those programs.
There's a lot of great ones.

30:08.500 --> 30:13.041
Uh, no, Marth, I meant, like,
me come back to school, to Harding High,

30:13.125 --> 30:14.500
and finish my senior year.

30:15.958 --> 30:16.875
What?

30:18.000 --> 30:18.875
God.

30:19.541 --> 30:20.458
No…

30:21.083 --> 30:21.916
No?

30:22.000 --> 30:24.375
Or not no, but maybe not?

30:24.458 --> 30:26.000
Steph, hey, you know what?

30:26.583 --> 30:27.875
Instead…

30:27.958 --> 30:30.291
Wow. There's online classes.

30:30.375 --> 30:32.083
Or… or… or… or…

30:32.166 --> 30:35.583
Um… Oh, GED courses
at the community college.

30:35.666 --> 30:38.333
I cannot move on
to the next chapter of my life

30:38.416 --> 30:41.375
if I'm still stuck in the old one
for 20 years.

30:41.958 --> 30:44.208
And I understand that, but…

30:44.833 --> 30:47.916
Steph… …I can't let
an almost 40-year-old woman

30:48.000 --> 30:49.166
into high school.

30:49.250 --> 30:54.458
Yeah, but you heard the doctor.
I'm still 17 mentally.

30:54.541 --> 30:55.708
-And look…
-That's--

30:55.791 --> 30:59.625
…that is medical.
And you cannot argue with science.

30:59.708 --> 31:02.375
-Are you sure you're ready to go back?
-Yes!

31:02.458 --> 31:05.958
High school was like yesterday for me.
It will not be weird at all.

31:06.833 --> 31:08.375
What else am I supposed to do?

31:08.458 --> 31:11.916
Start an OnlyFans account?
Queef for 20 dollars?

31:12.000 --> 31:13.291
-What?
-That's…

31:13.375 --> 31:15.083
I think that's what happens there.

31:15.166 --> 31:18.250
Those aren't your only two options.
You have lots of options.

31:18.833 --> 31:22.541
Look… …high school,
it's an intense but delicate ecosystem.

31:22.625 --> 31:24.583
Yeah, which I can handle.

31:25.166 --> 31:27.833
But you know what? There's only a month
of the school year left--

31:27.916 --> 31:30.541
Oh, that's perfect!
That's basically the time that I missed!

31:31.291 --> 31:34.291
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, that is, like, fate.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.541
Like, Destiny's Child.

31:38.291 --> 31:41.958
Well, you might be
the first person in history

31:42.041 --> 31:44.208
to use a doctor's note to get into school.

31:44.291 --> 31:46.708

31:47.291 --> 31:50.291

Hi!
G'day, mate!

33:01.250 --> 33:04.583
I wanted to say hi in your native tongue.
'Cause you're Australian, right?

33:04.666 --> 33:06.416
-Yes. Yeah.
-Oh, good, good, good!

33:06.500 --> 33:09.625
Your friend, my boss, Principal Riser,
asked me to show you around

33:09.708 --> 33:12.041
and give you a little orientation
here at Harding.

33:12.125 --> 33:14.958
Oh, okay. I don't really need to.
I know my way around.

33:15.041 --> 33:18.500
Oh, come on, it's fun.
I have nothing else to do.

33:18.583 --> 33:22.291
I'm Mr. Tapper, the guidance counselor,
but you can call me Mr. T.

33:22.375 --> 33:26.250
Is that because you…
…"pity the fool" who has a bad first day?

33:26.333 --> 33:27.666
Oh.

33:27.750 --> 33:31.250
Well, yeah. Yeah, I would feel…
I would feel terrible.

33:31.333 --> 33:34.208
No. I meant, like,
you know, Mr. T.

33:34.291 --> 33:37.208
"I pity the fool. I pity the fool."

33:37.291 --> 33:41.500
I've never said that before, but I guess
I could start if you wanted me to.

33:41.583 --> 33:42.875
I pity the fool!

33:43.666 --> 33:45.958
Mr. T is pitying fools over here.

33:46.041 --> 33:50.000
All right, let's, um…
let's… let's go on a little tour here.

33:50.083 --> 33:53.291
I have your records here from 2002.
You were a cheerleader.

33:53.375 --> 33:55.625
-Cheer captain.
-Ooh, cheer captain.

33:55.708 --> 34:00.125
Uh, president of the Fashion Club.
Whoa! Your grades were pretty good.

34:00.208 --> 34:03.916
My God, shut up. Don't. I don't want
anybody here to think I'm a dork.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.791
I'm saying
graduating shouldn't be a problem.

34:05.875 --> 34:06.958
Wait. What happened?

34:07.625 --> 34:09.875
Where are
all the prom king and queen winners?

34:09.958 --> 34:13.875
Oh, um, Principal Riser felt
that it sent a bad message,

34:13.958 --> 34:16.333
so she replaced it
with something more positive.

34:17.125 --> 34:19.583
-That looks like a bunch of tampons.
-Yeah, it is.

34:19.666 --> 34:21.375
But it's also found art.

34:21.875 --> 34:24.250
So you're saying they're found tampons.

34:25.125 --> 34:27.625
Oh, yes, I am.

34:40.541 --> 34:44.083
If not, just pretend
it's fake history.

34:44.166 --> 34:45.333
Oh! I am so sorry.

34:46.750 --> 34:47.583
Stephanie?

34:48.250 --> 34:49.875
-Oh my God!
-It… it's… it's Seth!

34:49.958 --> 34:51.291
-Seth?
-Yeah!

34:51.375 --> 34:53.041
-Oh, Seth!
-Oh my goodness!

34:53.125 --> 34:54.875
-Oh!
-Wow!

34:54.958 --> 34:56.666
Martha said that you were back,

34:56.750 --> 34:59.500
and I guess, in my head,
I just couldn't make it real,

34:59.583 --> 35:01.250
but look at you. You look great!

35:01.333 --> 35:04.250
It's me! Like, look,
I'm walking and talking.

35:04.333 --> 35:06.166
-Yeah. Doing all those things.
-Everything.

35:06.250 --> 35:07.958
Just like you used to, walk and talk.

35:08.041 --> 35:10.625
Well, look at you! Oh my God!

35:10.708 --> 35:14.583
-You look so cool and suave and adult.
-Yeah.

35:14.666 --> 35:17.708
Wow! What happened to that nerd
that used to just hang out in the library?

35:17.791 --> 35:20.000
He became the school librarian.

35:20.791 --> 35:21.916
Seriously?

35:22.000 --> 35:23.083
-Mm-hmm.
-Ah…

35:23.166 --> 35:25.333
Seth, thank you so much for the yearbook.

35:25.416 --> 35:27.458
Why didn't you just come in and say hi?

35:27.541 --> 35:31.458
You know,
I didn't wanna overwhelm you, you know.

35:31.541 --> 35:33.958
Plus, I can't stay out so late
on a school night.

35:34.041 --> 35:36.666
-Ah, shit. Shoot.

35:36.750 --> 35:37.583
Dang!

35:38.083 --> 35:42.083
I wish I could hang out and talk more,
but I gotta get back to work.

35:42.166 --> 35:44.791
-Oh, yeah, I got to get back to class.
-Yeah.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.916
I don't wanna be
20 years and ten minutes late.

35:47.583 --> 35:50.916
So, I will see you around.
You know where to find me.

35:51.000 --> 35:54.416
Yeah, same.
You know where to find me, in the library.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.666
-Some things never change, right?
-Bye, Seth. I'll call you.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.833
Or you can do some long division, I guess.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.958
Steph, how's your first day?

36:06.041 --> 36:09.208
Oh my God,
it's just been, like, so amazing.

36:09.291 --> 36:12.666
Like, just making new friends.
Everyone's already obsessed with me.

36:12.750 --> 36:16.000
That's so great. We strive
for a welcoming environment here.

36:16.083 --> 36:19.708
Um, listen, I need to talk to you
about rejoining the Bulldogettes.

36:19.791 --> 36:23.000
Um, instead of cheer, I think
you should be focusing on your schoolwork.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.125
Yeah. Sure, sure, sure, sure, sure!

36:25.208 --> 36:28.541
Um, but who do I talk to about rejoining?

36:29.875 --> 36:32.750
Well, you would talk to me.
I'm the cheer coach now.

36:32.833 --> 36:35.000
Okay. Wait, I see your game.

36:35.083 --> 36:36.375
You become principal

36:36.458 --> 36:39.958
so then you can get real power
by running the cheer squad.

36:40.041 --> 36:41.750
That's smart. I respect that.

36:41.833 --> 36:45.166
Yeah, that… that's not why
I got my master's in education.

36:45.250 --> 36:47.666
Um, look, I don't think the cheer squad

36:47.750 --> 36:49.208
needs a new member right now.

36:49.791 --> 36:52.333
Well, that's wrong
'cause every cheer squad in the country

36:52.416 --> 36:53.666
would love to have me.

36:53.750 --> 36:57.583
There's only two performances left,
so I don't think it's worth it.

36:57.666 --> 37:00.500
Marth, I only need
one performance to make a splash

37:00.583 --> 37:02.541
if I have any chance
of becoming prom queen.

37:03.875 --> 37:06.125
-Steph…
-This head still needs a crown.

37:06.208 --> 37:09.916
I'm so sorry.
It's not gonna get it.

37:10.000 --> 37:10.875
Steph,

37:11.791 --> 37:14.416
we do not have
prom queen at this school anymore.

37:19.708 --> 37:21.833
Oh my God, are you having a mini stroke?

37:26.291 --> 37:27.166
What?

37:27.250 --> 37:29.666
Competitions like that, they're dangerous.

37:29.750 --> 37:33.250
Winning things, it just…
it doesn't reflect our school values.

37:33.333 --> 37:36.625
With no winners, there aren't any losers.

37:36.708 --> 37:39.500
I've made a school with no losers.

37:39.583 --> 37:43.208
But everybody was just talking to me
about how much they want prom queen.

37:43.291 --> 37:47.291
Steph, if all the students want it back,
they know they can petition for it.

37:47.375 --> 37:49.041
But so far no one has.

37:49.125 --> 37:51.375
Oh, that was so close.
You were so close.

37:51.458 --> 37:54.291
-Let me put it my mouth.
-One more. Ready and one…

37:54.916 --> 37:56.500
Yay!

37:56.583 --> 37:59.333
Oh, hey, is this where the ho-bags sit?

38:00.041 --> 38:02.375
♪ Ho-ing down with the ho-bags, yeah ♪

38:02.958 --> 38:05.375
♪ Ho… ♪
That's a fun way of saying "what's up?"

38:05.458 --> 38:07.833
-I'm Janet.
-And I'm Yaz, and that's Neil.

38:07.916 --> 38:10.208
I just have to say I'm living
for this little vintage fit.

38:10.291 --> 38:12.458
-And I'm not even JK-ing. Okay?

38:12.541 --> 38:16.250
Okay, what is with
this enormous lunch table?

38:16.333 --> 38:18.541
How are we supposed to know
where the popular kids sit?

38:18.625 --> 38:22.458
Well, when there's just one table,
we're all popular kids.

38:22.541 --> 38:24.708
-Everybody.
-Oh no, no, no. That's not how life works.

38:24.791 --> 38:26.791
There's only, like, three ways
to become popular,

38:26.875 --> 38:29.458
to be a cheerleader,
to work at Abercrombie,

38:29.541 --> 38:31.208
or to let guys go in the back door.

38:31.291 --> 38:33.166
-What?
-Oh my God, I must be really popular then.

38:33.250 --> 38:35.416
-What?

38:36.416 --> 38:38.750
-Nothing.
-Anyways, um, Janet…

38:38.833 --> 38:40.166
Mm-hmm.

38:40.250 --> 38:43.750
…I was wondering
if you would like to sign my petition.

38:43.833 --> 38:46.041
It's to bring back
prom queen to Harding High.

38:46.125 --> 38:48.541
-Oh my gosh!
-No way!

38:48.625 --> 38:50.583
Do I respect IRL grassroot efforts

38:50.666 --> 38:53.083
to effect change
into societal systems? Yes.

38:53.166 --> 38:56.750
It's also very refreshing
to see non-digital campaign strategy.

38:56.833 --> 38:58.333
-It is.
-So I'll sign it.

38:58.416 --> 39:01.791
I'll sign it too, but don't be surprised
if we're the only ones.

39:02.375 --> 39:03.541
Why's that?

39:03.625 --> 39:06.208
Because nobody's gonna sign this
unless Bri Luvs signs it.

39:06.291 --> 39:08.125
-Who?
-Her.

39:08.750 --> 39:11.458
Bri Luvs.
That's just her name on social media.

39:11.541 --> 39:14.291
She's got, like,
three million Instagram followers.

39:14.375 --> 39:18.791
And that 98 pounds of sexy is Lance,
her fine-ass boyfriend.

39:18.875 --> 39:21.791
Last year, Vice did a whole vlog
about their open relaish

39:21.875 --> 39:24.666
and called it
the gold standard of the future.

39:24.750 --> 39:27.166
Cool, cool, cool.
So, um, how do I get her to sign it?

39:27.250 --> 39:30.208
Oh, you won't. She's untouchable.

39:30.291 --> 39:33.250
Okay, everyone's friends with her,
but she's friends with no one.

39:33.333 --> 39:34.166
Yeah.

39:34.250 --> 39:36.125
-She's coming over here.
-No, she's not.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.375
-Just act normal. Avoid eye contact and--
-Okay.

39:38.458 --> 39:42.083
-Yaz! Been a minute, huh?
-It has been so long.

39:42.166 --> 39:46.500
So long! And Janet, loved your post about
alternative body positivity the other day.

39:46.583 --> 39:48.375
You are so inspiring.

39:48.458 --> 39:50.791
I was just showing off
my new bathing suit.

39:50.875 --> 39:53.875
Hi, I'm Bri, and you must be Stephanie.

39:53.958 --> 39:55.041
I heard about you.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.750
Really?

39:56.833 --> 39:57.791
I mean, um…

39:58.833 --> 40:01.666
Yeah, obviously,
because I'm, like, the total shiznit,

40:01.750 --> 40:04.541
and I basically used to be you
when I went here.

40:04.625 --> 40:07.541
You know, the most popular girl in school
'cause we're the same.

40:07.625 --> 40:09.875
I don't really think about popularity.

40:09.958 --> 40:12.666
I'm just trying to build
my most authentic, socially conscious,

40:12.750 --> 40:16.125
body-positive, environmentally aware,
and economically compassionate brand

40:16.208 --> 40:18.500
that's a home for inclusion,
focused fashion, food,

40:18.583 --> 40:19.958
and fun-filled lifestyles.

40:20.041 --> 40:22.916
And if tons of people respond to that,
then, great.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.750
Totally. Yes.

40:25.833 --> 40:28.291
I mean, obviously.

40:28.375 --> 40:31.333
Um, while I've got you here,
would you mind signing this?

40:31.416 --> 40:33.541
I'm gonna stop you right there.

40:33.625 --> 40:37.250
I made a paper-free pledge this year,
so I only deal with forms digitally.

40:37.333 --> 40:40.291
I'm sure you understand.
But can we take an ussie?

40:40.875 --> 40:42.791
Yes. Absolutely.

40:42.875 --> 40:45.416
-Where to?

40:45.500 --> 40:48.000
Where are we going? We're going--
Ooh. What? Sorry.

40:49.916 --> 40:51.625
-What was that?
-Oh, before I forget.

40:51.708 --> 40:54.375
My mom, Tiffany,
told me to tell you she says hi.

40:54.458 --> 40:56.416
She said to remind you
she's married to Blaine

40:56.500 --> 40:58.666
and lives in your dream house,
in case you couldn't place her.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.666
Your mom, Tiffany.

41:00.750 --> 41:02.833
Nice meeting you, Stephanie. Bye.

41:03.541 --> 41:05.250
-Bye.
-Bye.

41:06.125 --> 41:08.416
Baby, you're manspreading again.

41:08.500 --> 41:09.375
Oh.

41:09.458 --> 41:10.750
-Whoops.

41:12.291 --> 41:14.833
Oh my God. He knows you exist.

41:14.916 --> 41:18.333
Yeah, 'cause probably
he's, like, already obsessed with me.

41:18.416 --> 41:21.625
-Oh my God. What is that? A fire drill?

41:21.708 --> 41:23.250
-Uh…
-What, robot invasion?

41:23.333 --> 41:24.333
Bri is going live.

41:24.958 --> 41:28.750
Hey, guys, we have a new student
at Harding High, and she's older than us.

41:28.833 --> 41:31.500
And I want to remind
everyone around the world

41:31.583 --> 41:35.000
that treating someone different
'cause they're elderly is called ageism,

41:35.083 --> 41:38.375
no matter how weird or foreign
or out of touch they may seem,

41:38.958 --> 41:40.166
and that's not cool.

41:40.750 --> 41:42.708
Also, stay tuned. I have amazing news

41:42.791 --> 41:45.666
about my upcoming summer
screen-detox vacay in Nepal.

41:45.750 --> 41:49.500
Remember, Bri loves you.

41:50.583 --> 41:51.541
That was hot.

41:52.125 --> 41:53.125
You're hot.

41:54.958 --> 41:57.791
-I'll sign your petition.
-Oh my God! Yay! Three people!

41:57.875 --> 41:59.083
-Whoo!
-Oh my God, no.

41:59.166 --> 42:01.500
Guys, I need
the cheerleaders to sign this.

42:01.583 --> 42:03.708
Because then everyone will.
Cheer pressure.

42:03.791 --> 42:07.041
Well, they'll sign it
'cause we already did.

42:07.875 --> 42:08.708
Ha!

42:08.791 --> 42:11.416
-You guys are the cheerleaders?
-Absolutely.

42:13.083 --> 42:15.333
-Ready?
-Okay!

42:15.416 --> 42:17.708
♪ The Earth is smoking ♪

42:17.791 --> 42:19.750
♪ We need new laws ♪

42:20.583 --> 42:25.541
♪ Turtles are choking on plastic straws ♪

42:27.083 --> 42:29.833
Oh.
Good job, good job. What'd you think?

42:31.083 --> 42:32.291
What was that?

42:32.833 --> 42:35.166
-Well, that's--
-What was that?

42:36.166 --> 42:38.833
-It's our most popular routine.
-Yeah.

42:39.791 --> 42:42.625
-Well, who were you guys cheering for?
-For everyone.

42:42.708 --> 42:45.625
You know, to do the right thing, right?
Team Humanity!

42:45.708 --> 42:47.041
Team Humanity!

42:47.125 --> 42:48.750
Uh…

42:48.833 --> 42:51.791
But what about, like, the music
and the dancing and the flipping?

42:51.875 --> 42:55.000
Oh. Oh no. No.
We do not do stunts anymore.

42:55.083 --> 42:57.791
-Oh.
-And also we don't do any sexy dancing.

42:57.875 --> 43:00.833
We'd rather have people listen
to our words than just our bodies.

43:00.916 --> 43:03.500
Okay, yeah, but this cheer
would be so much better

43:03.583 --> 43:07.083
if you guys made me believe you were
seconds away from showing your tits.

43:07.166 --> 43:09.000
-No, Steph…
-Yes, Martha.

43:09.083 --> 43:11.750
-Okay.
-Yes. I had this one signature move.

43:11.833 --> 43:15.375
You'll love it. It's called lips to lips.
Everybody, do it with me.

43:15.458 --> 43:17.041
-Don't.
-You start on the face.

43:17.125 --> 43:18.666
-Fingers go down the body.
-No.

43:18.750 --> 43:20.208
Down the body and up.

43:20.291 --> 43:22.708
No! Why is everyone doing it?
I'm saying don't do it.

43:22.791 --> 43:24.291
-Okay, look.
-Okay.

43:24.375 --> 43:27.541
We would do that, but our freshman year,
Bri Luvs made an Instagram post

43:27.625 --> 43:29.791
saying that cheerleaders
were anti-feminist.

43:29.875 --> 43:32.291
The whole school turned against us,
and we had to recalibrate.

43:32.375 --> 43:34.791
Her post got, like, seven million likes.

43:34.875 --> 43:36.375
-Eight million.
-It was for the best.

43:36.458 --> 43:39.166
Anyways, let's show her
our gun control routine.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.833
-It's one of our best.
-No, wait!

43:40.916 --> 43:43.458
What even is this squad? Like…

43:45.291 --> 43:46.791
Is there even a cheer captain?

43:46.875 --> 43:49.041
-Yeah.
-Yeah, Stephanie, I am the cheer captain.

43:49.125 --> 43:51.375
-I am the cheer captain.
-I am the cheer captain.

43:51.458 --> 43:53.250
I'm a cheer captain.

43:53.333 --> 43:54.500
-And also the coach.
-You?

43:55.625 --> 43:58.541
Martha, that's the most fucked up thing
I've ever heard.

43:58.625 --> 44:02.291
Steph, we are all cheer captains here
to promote… Say it with me.

44:02.375 --> 44:05.041
Equality!

44:05.125 --> 44:08.250
-Including you, Steph.
-Welcome.

44:08.333 --> 44:10.916
-Do you love it? Are you okay?

44:11.708 --> 44:13.000
Oh my God.

44:13.083 --> 44:15.333
-Oh my God.
-She loves it, you guys. You nailed it!

44:18.000 --> 44:19.958
-Oh my God!
-Aw!

44:23.666 --> 44:25.125
Excuse me, Mr. Bud.

44:25.208 --> 44:26.500
Hey, what's up?

44:26.583 --> 44:28.500
Um, seeing as you're my librarian now,

44:28.583 --> 44:31.625
you're legally obligated
to help me research something, yeah?

44:31.708 --> 44:32.541
Yeah, by law.

44:32.625 --> 44:36.291
Yeah, I think the teachers union's
a real stickler about that sort of thing.

44:36.375 --> 44:39.208
I'm just kidding.
I'm not in the union. What's up?

44:39.291 --> 44:41.833
-Oh, this is addictive.
-Yeah.

44:41.916 --> 44:45.083
Social platforms have become
a vital tool for communication.

44:45.166 --> 44:48.250
Look, it's a turtle humping a rock!

44:48.333 --> 44:49.666
-Yeah.
-Oh, get it. Get it.

44:49.750 --> 44:51.416
Yeah, oh, that gets a heart.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.916
-And it's also that.

44:53.000 --> 44:55.791
Okay. All right.
I think I've worked this thing out.

44:55.875 --> 44:56.708
Okay.

44:56.791 --> 44:59.458
So, basically you get followers
by being somebody everybody likes.

44:59.541 --> 45:00.375
Mm-hmm.

45:00.458 --> 45:03.666
So it's a popularity contest,
but instead of just high school,

45:03.750 --> 45:06.750
it's now the whole world,
and the whole world is your phone.

45:06.833 --> 45:08.708
Yeah. I mean, that's exactly it.

45:08.791 --> 45:10.541
-That's it.
-Yeah, it's pretty sad.

45:10.625 --> 45:14.250
No! This is, like, amazing.
This is like a shortcut.

45:14.333 --> 45:17.500
Wow, I immediately regret
showing you this.

45:17.583 --> 45:19.750
Just to be clear,
this is a way for people to pretend

45:19.833 --> 45:22.000
their life and skin texture
is better than it is.

45:22.083 --> 45:25.708
Is that why you've posted this picture
of you with this random hot chick?

45:25.791 --> 45:28.625
No, that's my ex-fiancée Diana.

45:28.708 --> 45:30.458
-You were engaged?
-I was.

45:30.541 --> 45:33.125
-Shut up! Seth.
- Uh-huh.

45:33.208 --> 45:35.041
That's actually how I ended up here.

45:35.125 --> 45:37.916
We both were working
at the National Archives in DC,

45:38.000 --> 45:40.333
and when we split up, I needed a change.

45:40.416 --> 45:42.958
So Martha got me a job at Harding,
and here I am.

45:43.041 --> 45:45.583
Trust me, being close to 40
and back at my high school

45:45.666 --> 45:47.208
isn't exactly where I wanted to be, but…

45:47.291 --> 45:50.083
-Oh. Tell me about it!
-Yeah, right!

45:50.166 --> 45:53.458
Uh, well, I should get back
to enriching young minds.

45:53.541 --> 45:55.291
Just kidding. I'm covering a drama class.

45:55.375 --> 45:56.625
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

45:56.708 --> 45:58.708
-All right. Oh!
-Bye!

46:02.000 --> 46:04.166
Need that back. Yeah, thanks, Steph.

46:05.333 --> 46:06.500
Please, Dad!

46:07.041 --> 46:09.333
Phones are like the new Tamagotchis.

46:09.416 --> 46:13.875
Okay? I need one, and I promise you,
I will not go over the minutes.

46:13.958 --> 46:17.791
Really, it's for my own personal safety,
'cause what happens if I get kidnapped?

46:17.875 --> 46:21.250
I think if you get kidnapped, Stephanie,
they'll probably take your phone.

46:21.333 --> 46:23.916
Not if I'd hidden it up my…

46:24.000 --> 46:27.416
Well, just to be safe,
it's probably a good thing.

46:28.041 --> 46:29.166
I got you this.

46:30.833 --> 46:32.916
Oh my God.

46:37.333 --> 46:38.250
Dad…

46:39.708 --> 46:41.375
-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

46:41.458 --> 46:43.375
Oh, you're the best dad!

46:46.000 --> 46:48.500
Dad, I can't believe this!

46:49.333 --> 46:51.833
Hey, guys, uh, it's just me, Stephanie.

46:51.916 --> 46:54.333
-I'm just chilling at my crib.

46:54.416 --> 46:56.083
I don't even know how to do this.

46:56.166 --> 47:00.875
I was just thinking that we should bring
prom queen back to Harding High.

47:00.958 --> 47:02.375
-#AwesomeIdea.

47:02.458 --> 47:04.208
-#Yes.

47:04.291 --> 47:07.208
-Spread it around. Let's make it a virus.

47:07.291 --> 47:08.541
That's… that's cute.

47:08.625 --> 47:10.791
Remember to vote
for this year's prom theme.

47:10.875 --> 47:13.291
The choices are A, Bridgerton,

47:13.375 --> 47:14.875
B, pride,

47:14.958 --> 47:18.750
and a last-minute write-in submission
by Stephanie Conway, C,

47:18.833 --> 47:20.750
The Real - New Orleans.

47:21.333 --> 47:23.625
-Democracy works only if you vote!
-What?

47:23.708 --> 47:26.416
-Stop, stop, stop.
-Love you all!

47:26.500 --> 47:28.166
-Oh my God.
-Are you going over there?

47:28.250 --> 47:29.291
-Okay.
-So fire.

47:29.375 --> 47:31.625
Let's wait
until the party to tell everyone.

47:31.708 --> 47:34.541
Oh my God,
is there a party happening? Whoo!

47:34.625 --> 47:37.625
Oh. Hi, Stephanie. What's up?

47:37.708 --> 47:40.958
I just came to say we're, like, cool.

47:41.041 --> 47:43.791
Okay? Even after the other day
when you, like, said I was old and shit.

47:43.875 --> 47:46.083
Oh, did you think that was mean?

47:46.166 --> 47:47.458
I am so sorry.

47:47.541 --> 47:48.791
I was just shedding light

47:48.875 --> 47:50.833
on an often overlooked
discrimination issue.

47:50.916 --> 47:52.208
Look, okay, I get.

47:52.291 --> 47:55.541
Queen bee feels very threatened
by the hot new girl

47:55.625 --> 47:57.458
and decides to go on the offensive.

47:57.541 --> 48:00.375
Classic Sandy/Rizzo.
It was the same way with your mum.

48:00.458 --> 48:03.250
I am not my mom. I'm nothing like her.

48:03.333 --> 48:06.750
So whatever went on between you two
has nothing to do with me.

48:06.833 --> 48:11.041
Awesome. Okay, so now that we're friends,
can you follow me on Insta?

48:11.125 --> 48:16.666
I'm "A" with this little circle around it
hot coma girl 113.

48:16.750 --> 48:19.583
Who knew?
There's 112 other hot coma girls.

48:19.666 --> 48:23.125
Mm-hmm. Okay, so I get this request a lot.

48:23.208 --> 48:25.416
Um, I limit my follows,

48:25.500 --> 48:28.083
'cause if I follow one person,
another might get mad,

48:28.166 --> 48:31.166
so it's a sacrifice I make
for everyone's mental health.

48:31.250 --> 48:33.291
Um, but good luck getting followers.

48:33.375 --> 48:36.041
Okay.
Well, wait, can you follow me?

48:36.750 --> 48:38.666
Can I follow her on Instagram?

48:38.750 --> 48:39.583
No.

48:40.083 --> 48:40.958
I can't.

48:41.041 --> 48:42.583
Sorry.

48:53.291 --> 48:54.666
Hey, Steph.

48:54.750 --> 48:57.416
-Holy shit. Mmm.
-Um, I'm doing a makeup tutorial.

48:57.500 --> 48:59.500
For who? Batman villains?

48:59.583 --> 49:01.708
I'm just really needing
some new followers.

49:01.791 --> 49:04.458
You don't realize
how many people don't care about you

49:04.541 --> 49:06.416
until you see it
as a number on your phone.

49:06.500 --> 49:10.166
Okay. Well, if you get tired
of being an influencer,

49:10.250 --> 49:13.708
the Natural History Museum is showing
Deep Impact on their IMAX all week.

49:13.791 --> 49:15.500
So, maybe we could go this weekend?

49:15.583 --> 49:17.625
Deep Impact again?

49:17.708 --> 49:21.541
Oh my God. You, me, and Martha
just watched that a couple weekends ago.

49:22.875 --> 49:26.250
Oh no, actually, I think you're thinking
of 1,000 weekends ago.

49:27.458 --> 49:29.416
Oh. Right.

49:29.500 --> 49:33.291
Mm. Okay, I would go,
but I've got a party this weekend.

49:33.375 --> 49:36.875
Oh, cool. Uh, you know, what night?
I'm completely free.

49:36.958 --> 49:40.500
I don't actually know yet,
so I'm just keeping my schedule open.

49:40.583 --> 49:42.666
Right.

49:43.208 --> 49:44.250
Just to be clear,

49:44.333 --> 49:46.708
you're saying no to attend
a party you haven't been invited to

49:46.791 --> 49:48.458
and don't know
when or where it's happening?

49:48.541 --> 49:51.291
Yeah. Okay, I gotta get back
to my contouring.

49:54.000 --> 49:54.875
All right.

49:58.291 --> 49:59.708
So hot.

49:59.791 --> 50:02.416
I mean, even just an hour a night,
that would be amazing.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.000
-I can make that happen.
-Yeah.

50:04.083 --> 50:04.916
Okay.

50:06.875 --> 50:07.833
What's going on?

50:08.916 --> 50:12.541
Why are you guys acting sus?
What? Don't say…

50:13.291 --> 50:16.916
Are you two together? Oh my God.
I'm not calling you Mum!

50:17.000 --> 50:20.291
Martha tells me you're already
falling behind in your classes.

50:20.375 --> 50:22.833
Are you doing crack cocaine?

50:22.916 --> 50:24.166
No.

50:24.250 --> 50:27.208
Dad, I'm just still adjusting.

50:28.000 --> 50:30.833
I just found out there were
eight more Fast and Furious movies.

50:30.916 --> 50:34.375
I just wanna make sure that you're giving
your schoolwork the attention it deserves.

50:34.458 --> 50:36.625
Well, I've just been really busy

50:36.708 --> 50:38.875
with super important stuff,
like making friends.

50:38.958 --> 50:41.500
-Well, good. I'm… That's great.
-Mm-hmm.

50:41.583 --> 50:43.583
-But you can still do your homework.
-Yep!

50:43.666 --> 50:46.041
You're smart, Steph,
always have been.

50:46.125 --> 50:48.625
I don't wanna see you
use this second chance incorrectly.

50:48.708 --> 50:51.458
Okay. Well, I've got
the solution for this.

50:51.541 --> 50:52.916
No phone for the weekend.

50:53.000 --> 50:54.500
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

50:55.541 --> 50:57.375
Dad, no. How else will I live?

50:57.458 --> 51:00.000
You survived 20 years without solid food.

51:00.083 --> 51:02.208
You can go for a weekend
without your iPhone, hon.

51:02.291 --> 51:03.708
-No!
-Hand it over.

51:03.791 --> 51:06.083
-Are you being serious?
-Yes. I am being very--

51:06.166 --> 51:08.041
Are you being full serious right now?

51:08.125 --> 51:10.000
-Full serious.
-Are you from Syria?

51:10.083 --> 51:11.125
I'm very serious.

51:11.208 --> 51:12.458
No!

51:13.875 --> 51:14.875
No!

51:14.958 --> 51:17.500
-Hand me the phone.
-Here, have it, then. Have it.

51:18.375 --> 51:19.208
It's a remote.

51:19.291 --> 51:21.958
-No!
-Uh…

51:22.041 --> 51:25.291
-Get off the door frame, honey.
-No! It's my phone!

51:25.375 --> 51:26.541
Give him the phone.

51:26.625 --> 51:27.708
No…

51:32.750 --> 51:34.708
Thanks a lot, Principal Martha.

51:35.208 --> 51:37.791
Oh my God, Lance and Bri look so hot.

51:37.875 --> 51:40.458
What the slut? They're all there.

51:40.541 --> 51:42.416
Can I… can I have my phone back now?

51:42.500 --> 51:44.208
Oh my God.

51:44.291 --> 51:46.625
Guys, what kind of psycho world is this

51:46.708 --> 51:49.708
where the cheerleaders
don't get invited to a party? Hello!

51:49.791 --> 51:51.833
Are they stupid? We are the party!

51:51.916 --> 51:53.666
Babe, of course we weren't invited.

51:53.750 --> 51:55.416
-It's DM VIP.
-Yeah.

51:55.500 --> 51:57.583
You only get to go to them
if they follow you.

51:57.666 --> 51:58.916
Only the hot, cool people.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.500
-Yeah.
-Well, yeah, but we are hot and cool.

52:01.583 --> 52:02.916
-Thank you.
-Um,

52:03.000 --> 52:05.458
four years of not getting invited
to those parties,

52:05.541 --> 52:08.416
the message gets, like, very clear.
We're not.

52:09.125 --> 52:12.791
This is kind of like a party.
I can have my dad pop in a Di.

52:14.916 --> 52:16.041
It means "DiGiorno."

52:16.125 --> 52:18.833
-Oh, oh, oh.
-No, I'm talking about a "party" party.

52:18.916 --> 52:22.541
I can't have video record of me partying.
The media's gonna use it to try

52:22.625 --> 52:25.833
and discredit me when I run for office,
like they did with AOC.

52:25.916 --> 52:26.750
No.

52:27.541 --> 52:31.625
Okay, guys, you need to listen up,
all right? This is now serious.

52:33.666 --> 52:37.250
We need to dance
because we need to show everybody

52:37.333 --> 52:38.666
that we are the cool ones.

52:38.750 --> 52:42.708
Guys, when I was in high school,
all the popular kids treated me like shit

52:42.791 --> 52:44.583
until I showed them how cool I was,

52:44.666 --> 52:48.708
which is so cool that
the most popular girl in high school,

52:48.791 --> 52:51.458
her boyfriend dumped her for me.

52:52.291 --> 52:54.416
-And you know who that was?
-Who?

52:55.333 --> 52:57.041
-Bri's mom.
-Tiffany?

52:58.083 --> 52:59.083
And that guy,

53:00.458 --> 53:01.291
Bri's dad.

53:01.375 --> 53:03.291
♪ Oh my God ♪

53:03.375 --> 53:04.791
What?

53:04.875 --> 53:10.000
And once you've blown someone's dad,
you realize they're not that scary.

53:10.083 --> 53:11.208
-Hmm.
-Good to know.

53:11.291 --> 53:12.416
Yeah, I mean…

53:12.500 --> 53:16.875
So, everybody, watch and learn.

53:16.958 --> 53:17.916
-Let's dance.
-Okay.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.541
Okay, can you hit play?
Yeah, nice fingering.

55:07.791 --> 55:09.291
Please don't blow my dad.

55:12.375 --> 55:15.416
Now, don't worry.
I've spoken with the school nurse,

55:15.500 --> 55:17.833
and with less than three weeks
until graduation,

55:17.916 --> 55:22.000
we are prepared
for an epidemic of senioritis.

55:24.750 --> 55:26.333
Freshmen suck.

55:27.125 --> 55:31.000
Um, okay. So without further ado,
please join me in welcoming

55:31.083 --> 55:34.666
the president of the Harding High PTA,
Tiffany Balbo.

55:42.333 --> 55:43.500
Hi!

55:44.083 --> 55:45.125
Thank you.

55:45.208 --> 55:47.958
And I know she's the principal, boo.

55:48.041 --> 55:49.000
Boo.

55:49.083 --> 55:52.875
-But give it up for Miss Riser, everyone.

55:52.958 --> 55:55.000
-Stop it.
-Sorry. Sorry.

55:55.083 --> 55:59.375
Okay. What a special evening
we get to share with our kids

55:59.458 --> 56:01.916
before they go off to adulthood.

56:02.000 --> 56:04.875
Okay, guys,
the energy in this place is sucking wiens.

56:04.958 --> 56:06.833
We need to get out there
and rock their worlds.

56:06.916 --> 56:07.958
Oh, and here's this.

56:08.041 --> 56:09.291
Huh?

56:09.375 --> 56:11.083
-It's the music for the routine.
-Oh, yes.

56:11.166 --> 56:14.208
Thank you for the computer tampon.
Shove that where that goes.

56:14.291 --> 56:16.000
Really, guys, you're the bomb diggity.

56:16.083 --> 56:17.291
-All of you.
-Aw!

56:17.375 --> 56:20.166
I love you,
and we're gonna crush the sluts and--

56:20.250 --> 56:24.083
Oh, it's the big finale, you guys.
It's the big finale!

56:24.166 --> 56:25.625
I'm so proud of you.

56:25.708 --> 56:28.000
You pumped to go out there
and change some minds?

56:29.041 --> 56:31.916
And just remember, this is all I have.

56:36.833 --> 56:39.833
And real quick,
due to the custom table-scapes,

56:39.916 --> 56:43.791
the prom ticket prices have gone
from $48 to $93.

56:43.875 --> 56:46.333
-We take Venmo and PayPal and Zelle.

56:46.416 --> 56:47.666
Thank you so much!

56:50.958 --> 56:52.333
Yeah!

56:52.416 --> 56:54.291
Okay. Thank you, parents.

56:54.375 --> 56:55.916
Speaking of prom,

56:56.000 --> 56:59.666
making good choices is at the forefront
of every school function,

56:59.750 --> 57:03.583

59:09.708 --> 59:10.916
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.625
Oh, and I wanted to say
I thought it was so cool

59:13.708 --> 59:16.416
that I was one of the first places
you stopped when you woke up.

59:16.500 --> 59:19.708
I can't tell you how many times
I've thought of you over the past years.

59:19.791 --> 59:20.833
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

59:22.125 --> 59:23.916
Well, even though
I was pretty much brain-dead,

59:24.000 --> 59:25.875
you were the one
that kept my heart beating.

59:25.958 --> 59:29.333
Well, listen, I'll just say,
you let me know

59:29.416 --> 59:32.500
if you ever want to take
another trip down memory Blaine.

59:32.583 --> 59:34.916
-Yeah, but, Blaine, what about Tiff?
-Eh.

59:35.500 --> 59:37.166
Didn't stop us the first time.

59:38.083 --> 59:40.125
What? You said you two were broken up.

59:40.208 --> 59:42.375
It's, uh… You know, I don't…

59:45.083 --> 59:46.208
-What?
-I was joking.

59:46.291 --> 59:49.208
I haven't forgotten
about your whole "no cheating" rule.

59:49.291 --> 59:52.041
Yeah, which is why we can't be together.

59:53.333 --> 59:54.166

Steph, the big deal is that I told you
that we don't do that anymore,

1:01:39.875 --> 1:01:42.250
and you went
and did it anyway behind my back.

1:01:42.333 --> 1:01:45.000
Are you really mad?
Or is this because Tiff yelled at you?

1:01:45.083 --> 1:01:45.958
Oh, Steph!

1:01:46.041 --> 1:01:48.625
You can't let her bully you,
I've always said that.

1:01:50.333 --> 1:01:51.375
I care about this

1:01:51.458 --> 1:01:54.833
because what you did up there,
it wasn't school-appropriate.

1:01:54.916 --> 1:01:56.000
You fondled yourself

1:01:56.083 --> 1:01:59.166
for an unsuspecting audience
in a routine about consent.

1:01:59.250 --> 1:02:01.416
But I gave myself consent

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:03.583
to do that to myself.

1:02:09.333 --> 1:02:10.833
You took away prom queen.

1:02:10.916 --> 1:02:13.833
You turned the cafeteria
into a Hogwarts without the magic.

1:02:13.916 --> 1:02:15.750
Are you trying
to make this place suck wiens?

1:02:15.833 --> 1:02:19.958
Number one, how dare you?
It is like Hogwarts with the magic.

1:02:20.541 --> 1:02:24.750
And number two,
it doesn't suck wiens. It's nice.

1:02:24.833 --> 1:02:26.791
It's… it's nice here.

1:02:26.875 --> 1:02:29.833
-I had more fun in a coma.
-You did not have more fun in the coma.

1:02:29.916 --> 1:02:32.250
I had more fun going like this.

1:02:34.708 --> 1:02:35.666
Stephanie.

1:02:35.750 --> 1:02:38.333
That was way more fun
than this high school.

1:02:38.416 --> 1:02:43.166
Steph, this may come as a shock to you,
but for most kids, high school sucks.

1:02:43.250 --> 1:02:46.916
I don't know why you're acting
like we didn't have the same experience.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:48.583
High school was awesome!

1:02:48.666 --> 1:02:53.125
Freshman year, you bailed on Seth and I
to go be some popular girl.

1:02:53.208 --> 1:02:56.666
No, I didn't bail. I just got more friends

1:02:56.750 --> 1:02:58.916
and a really hot boyfriend.

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.541
Seriously, if you'd had a boyfriend,
you would have understood.

1:03:01.625 --> 1:03:04.875
Stephanie, I wouldn't understand
because I'm gay.

1:03:04.958 --> 1:03:07.291
Ooh, you can't say that word,
unless you're saying it

1:03:07.375 --> 1:03:10.708
in a neutral-positive way
to refer to someone that is…

1:03:13.250 --> 1:03:14.375
Mm-hmm.

1:03:15.708 --> 1:03:16.583
Oh.

1:03:17.666 --> 1:03:18.500
Yeah.

1:03:18.583 --> 1:03:23.208
And it… it made high school
a living hell for me.

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:26.708
Back then, I felt very alone

1:03:27.708 --> 1:03:32.375
and angry and so threatened

1:03:32.458 --> 1:03:38.083
that if I showed one iota of my real self,
then I would be ripped to shreds

1:03:39.375 --> 1:03:43.041
by Tiffany or Blaine or you.

1:03:43.625 --> 1:03:44.500
Me?

1:03:45.750 --> 1:03:47.875
No way. Why would you even say that?

1:03:47.958 --> 1:03:51.541
Because, Steph,
sometimes I didn't know who you were.

1:03:53.208 --> 1:03:54.833
Or… are.

1:03:56.166 --> 1:03:57.291
Look, let's…

1:03:57.375 --> 1:03:59.583
There's three weeks left
of the school year.

1:03:59.666 --> 1:04:03.000
So let's just get through those
as peacefully as possible,

1:04:03.083 --> 1:04:06.500
and then I can go
to my family's lake house for the summer.

1:04:08.958 --> 1:04:12.916
The periodic table
is made up of 119 elements.

1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:16.666
Oh, hey, space nerds. JK, JK.

1:04:16.750 --> 1:04:20.000
Any of you want to come see Deep Impact
with me and Blaine this weekend?

1:04:20.583 --> 1:04:23.291
As part of my collab
with the Natural History Museum,

1:04:23.375 --> 1:04:28.166
you will get 20% off ticket prices
and complimentary space ice cream.

1:04:28.250 --> 1:04:30.833
So come watch
the end of the world with us.

1:04:30.916 --> 1:04:33.666
Remember it just for me. Please.

1:04:33.750 --> 1:04:36.250
-No one's gonna read you.

1:04:38.250 --> 1:04:40.416
Oh boy,
no one's gonna read you.

1:04:41.166 --> 1:04:42.708
Are you talking to the books?

1:04:43.208 --> 1:04:46.416
-Oh, yeah, I find it helps them grow.
-Still a dork.

1:04:46.500 --> 1:04:48.375
-Huh.
-So…

1:04:48.458 --> 1:04:49.333
Uh,

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.041
do you, like, still wanna see Deep Impact?

1:04:54.791 --> 1:04:56.166
I'm gonna get some popcorn.

1:04:56.250 --> 1:05:00.875
Maybe some freeze-dried space ice cream.
Maybe some Milk Duds, some Whoppers,

1:05:00.958 --> 1:05:04.083
some Juicy Fruit.
I gotta keep this girlish figure.

1:05:04.166 --> 1:05:05.708
You want anything, or…

1:05:05.791 --> 1:05:09.333
Um, oh, no, no, no, don't go just yet.
Just hang here for one second.

1:05:09.416 --> 1:05:10.375
Yeah, sure.

1:05:10.458 --> 1:05:14.791
Oh my God, Seth, you're such a gentleman
going to get the snacks.

1:05:14.875 --> 1:05:17.708
Oh my God, I swear,
you have such a massive dick.

1:05:17.791 --> 1:05:20.833
-What did you say?
-What? Oh, Blaine, Tiffany.

1:05:20.916 --> 1:05:22.958
-Hi!
-Hi! What are you doing here?

1:05:23.041 --> 1:05:24.458
What a coincidence.

1:05:24.541 --> 1:05:27.125
I'm, um, here on a date with Seth.

1:05:27.208 --> 1:05:29.416
He asked me out, and I said,

1:05:29.500 --> 1:05:32.958
"You know what? I am single
and so horny, so yes."

1:05:33.041 --> 1:05:34.875
-Isn't that right?
-Yep.

1:05:34.958 --> 1:05:35.833
Really?

1:05:35.916 --> 1:05:38.208
Wait, I'm sorry.
You are on a date with Sethany?

1:05:38.291 --> 1:05:40.916
-Well, it's just Seth.

1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:44.041
Relax. I'm just joking.

1:05:44.125 --> 1:05:46.666
Well, yeah,
we're just here to see a movie.

1:05:46.750 --> 1:05:49.291
It's not like
we're gonna have hot, consensual sex

1:05:49.375 --> 1:05:50.583
when the lights go down.

1:05:50.666 --> 1:05:53.333
Mm-hmm. Hmm. Hmm?

1:05:53.416 --> 1:05:55.041
Wow! Uh…

1:05:55.125 --> 1:05:58.541
Wow, Seth, it only took 20 years
and some brain damage,

1:05:58.625 --> 1:06:01.375
but she finally agreed
to go out with you. Way to go!

1:06:02.083 --> 1:06:04.250
Again, just joking.

1:06:06.416 --> 1:06:08.166
-Hilarious.
-Let's go find our seats.

1:06:08.250 --> 1:06:10.333
-Huh?
-Let's go find our seats.

1:06:11.541 --> 1:06:14.458
-We gotta go find our seats.
-Down in front, yep.

1:06:14.541 --> 1:06:15.416
Yeah.

1:06:16.125 --> 1:06:18.041
-Oh, yeah.
-"Sethany."

1:06:27.583 --> 1:06:29.208
Feed me some popcorn.

1:06:30.375 --> 1:06:31.750
Are you serious about that?

1:06:32.541 --> 1:06:36.666
Yeah, just be awesome.
Just… just toss some into my mouth.

1:06:36.750 --> 1:06:37.625
All right.

1:06:42.791 --> 1:06:43.791
Seth!

1:06:44.750 --> 1:06:47.833
Oh my God. It's stuck in my throat.
Oh, I'm choking.

1:06:47.916 --> 1:06:50.666
-No, I really… I just got a Milk Dud.
-Did you actually choke on that?

1:06:50.750 --> 1:06:52.958
Yeah, it's stuck right there,
but it's all right.

1:06:53.041 --> 1:06:54.875
I thought that was
a euphemism kind of thing.

1:06:54.958 --> 1:06:56.833
-Fire tether pitons.
-Pitons fired.

1:07:10.666 --> 1:07:12.541
-Stop it.
-What?

1:07:12.625 --> 1:07:15.833
You're eye-fucking Stephanie so hard,
she'll need the morning-after pill.

1:07:15.916 --> 1:07:18.000
I am not eye-fucking anybody.

1:07:18.083 --> 1:07:21.916
It is embarrassing. Do you want me
to call Dr. Wilbin for more therapy?

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.625
-Don't threaten me with a good time.
-Shut up!

1:07:24.708 --> 1:07:27.833
Bitch, turn your ugly face around
and watch the movie.

1:07:27.916 --> 1:07:29.833
Careful how you talk
to senior citizens.

1:07:29.916 --> 1:07:30.916
Shut up, Blaine.

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.625
Ma'am, I'm gonna have
to ask you to be quiet.

1:07:33.708 --> 1:07:34.916
I am not the problem.

1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.416
There is a freaking porno
happening over there!

1:07:38.000 --> 1:07:40.041
-What?
-Don't put that on my face.

1:07:40.125 --> 1:07:42.291
It is not my fault.
I am not doing anything.

1:07:42.375 --> 1:07:45.541
Be quiet. I'm trying to watch the movie.

1:07:45.625 --> 1:07:47.500
You're afraid you'll miss something?

1:07:47.583 --> 1:07:48.958
The asteroid hits,

1:07:49.041 --> 1:07:53.125
and Téa Leoni and her Austrian dad
get hit by a ginormous wave.

1:07:53.208 --> 1:07:54.416
-Aw.
-What?

1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:57.375
Oh, come on! We all knew that!

1:07:57.458 --> 1:07:59.083
Can you…

1:07:59.833 --> 1:08:00.833
-Sorry.
-Ma'am?

1:08:00.916 --> 1:08:02.041
I…

1:08:02.125 --> 1:08:04.708
-Ma'am, come with me.
-Okay, fine. Blaine?

1:08:04.791 --> 1:08:06.708
What is the name of your manager?

1:08:07.208 --> 1:08:10.416
Sir? I am going to have
to email your manager.

1:08:15.958 --> 1:08:17.416
-Ah!

1:08:17.500 --> 1:08:20.625
Two decades later, and I still love
watching Tiff lose her mind.

1:08:20.708 --> 1:08:24.416
-I mean, that was incredibly satisfying.
-Mm-hmm.

1:08:24.500 --> 1:08:25.625
Okay, now I understand

1:08:25.708 --> 1:08:28.458
why you devoted so much of your time
on it in high school.

1:08:28.541 --> 1:08:30.833
-Well, not the whole time.
-Oh?

1:08:30.916 --> 1:08:34.166
Just all of my junior,
sophomore, and most of my senior year.

1:08:34.250 --> 1:08:35.125
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1:08:35.708 --> 1:08:38.416
Anyways, Marth told me
something about you in high school.

1:08:38.500 --> 1:08:40.583
Oh God. What?

1:08:41.333 --> 1:08:44.166
She said that you had
a crush on me.

1:08:45.041 --> 1:08:45.875
Yes.

1:08:46.500 --> 1:08:50.208
When we were in high school,
I was very much in love with you.

1:08:50.291 --> 1:08:51.500
Seth!

1:08:51.583 --> 1:08:53.333
-Eh.
-You were? Really?

1:08:53.416 --> 1:08:55.916
-Eh.
-Why didn't you ever say anything?

1:08:56.000 --> 1:08:58.666
'Cause, you know,
we were friends.

1:08:58.750 --> 1:09:00.375
-Yeah.
-And you were with Blaine.

1:09:00.458 --> 1:09:03.375
And, you know, we both know
what your answer would've been.

1:09:03.458 --> 1:09:07.208
Maybe, maybe not.
We're hanging out right now, aren't we?

1:09:07.291 --> 1:09:10.916
Yeah, but that's only because you thought
you could use me to make Blaine jealous.

1:09:11.875 --> 1:09:14.958
Steph, come on. I'm a full-blown adult.

1:09:15.041 --> 1:09:17.875
I think I can recognize
a teenage trick when I see one.

1:09:17.958 --> 1:09:20.791
That's not what's going on.

1:09:20.875 --> 1:09:24.500
Oh, come on, you used to pull this with me
and Marth all the time in high school.

1:09:24.583 --> 1:09:27.625
You'd use our attention
to make the popular kids crave yours.

1:09:27.708 --> 1:09:29.416
Um, did I?

1:09:29.916 --> 1:09:30.750
Yes.

1:09:30.833 --> 1:09:34.208
We always wondered
if those kids ever got to really meet you.

1:09:34.875 --> 1:09:35.833
Like, the real you.

1:09:38.250 --> 1:09:40.875
Well, I did have
a really fun time tonight.

1:09:41.875 --> 1:09:43.208
I'm… I'm sorry.

1:09:43.291 --> 1:09:44.291
No, forget it.

1:09:44.875 --> 1:09:46.291
So should I take you home?

1:09:47.041 --> 1:09:51.041
Or we could continue to hang out.
I have an idea of where we could go.

1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.333
Whoa, okay. This place has changed.

1:09:57.916 --> 1:09:59.791
Yeah, I think the lights are just on.

1:10:00.791 --> 1:10:02.000
-Come on.
-Okay.

1:10:04.375 --> 1:10:06.041
Bri, baby, I need favor.

1:10:09.291 --> 1:10:12.416
I want you
to get prom king and queen reinstated.

1:10:13.833 --> 1:10:14.708
What?

1:10:15.750 --> 1:10:16.583
Mom.

1:10:17.125 --> 1:10:18.791
No. No one cares about that.

1:10:18.875 --> 1:10:19.833
I do.

1:10:20.416 --> 1:10:23.750
I want you to beat Steph for prom queen.

1:10:23.833 --> 1:10:26.750
You said it rewards archaic gender roles.

1:10:26.833 --> 1:10:32.750
Well, exactly, which is why
you need to be the woke prom queen.

1:10:33.916 --> 1:10:36.041
I've already got interest
from some brands,

1:10:36.125 --> 1:10:37.708
and they are supes into it.

1:10:37.791 --> 1:10:39.791
Mom. I'm not doing this.

1:10:39.875 --> 1:10:43.166
And don't say "woke" or "supes."

1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:46.541
Just beat Steph for mommy.

1:10:47.291 --> 1:10:48.458
You owe me.

1:10:48.541 --> 1:10:49.750
For what?

1:10:51.458 --> 1:10:52.500
For being alive.

1:10:52.583 --> 1:10:56.541
And if you wanna go on your trip to Nepal,
you will do this for me.

1:11:01.541 --> 1:11:03.375
-Can I ask you something?
-Hmm?

1:11:03.458 --> 1:11:06.166
Does it get exhausting trying to make
everybody like you all the time?

1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:07.875
Well,

1:11:09.208 --> 1:11:11.333
it will be worth it when I win prom queen.

1:11:11.416 --> 1:11:16.416
Well, what I remember about prom
is that it was overhyped,

1:11:17.166 --> 1:11:19.750
you weren't there, and it sucked.

1:11:19.833 --> 1:11:23.041
-That's your memories of prom. That's it?
-Yeah, pretty much.

1:11:23.125 --> 1:11:25.333
Seth! Dude, come on.

1:11:26.208 --> 1:11:29.291
Did you even try to have fun? Did you
even try to tear it up on the dance floor?

1:11:29.375 --> 1:11:32.083
-Just, like, give it the old groove? No!
-Yeah!

1:11:32.166 --> 1:11:35.416
It wouldn't have mattered,
because prom doesn't matter,

1:11:35.500 --> 1:11:37.458
especially not prom queen.

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.083
You maniac.

1:11:39.166 --> 1:11:40.416
Come on, Steph.

1:11:40.500 --> 1:11:44.083
You will yourself out of a coma,
and that's what you care about?

1:11:44.166 --> 1:11:46.666
-It's more than just a crown to me.
-Hmm.

1:11:47.625 --> 1:11:49.625
When I moved here to America,

1:11:50.916 --> 1:11:51.958
it was so hard.

1:11:52.041 --> 1:11:55.458
-Everyone made fun of me, as you remember.
-Yeah.

1:11:55.541 --> 1:11:57.083
And then Mum got sick.

1:11:59.125 --> 1:12:02.375
And I was miserable. I was so miserable.

1:12:04.916 --> 1:12:07.625
And you know what she used to say
to help cheer me up?

1:12:08.458 --> 1:12:13.916
She'd, like, say, "Steph, close your eyes
and imagine your perfect life."

1:12:14.833 --> 1:12:17.458
"And if you can imagine it,
you can have it."

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:19.875
I was like… …"Shut up, Mom."

1:12:21.166 --> 1:12:22.458
I didn't believe her.

1:12:23.958 --> 1:12:25.125
Then she died.

1:12:28.791 --> 1:12:30.875
Then I was…

1:12:31.375 --> 1:12:34.833
I didn't tell anyone, but I was…
I was more miserable than ever.

1:12:37.750 --> 1:12:41.291
And then one day when we were driving
and I saw Deanna Russo,

1:12:41.375 --> 1:12:45.208
and I was like, "Whoa, she's happy."

1:12:45.833 --> 1:12:47.250
And she was prom queen,

1:12:48.000 --> 1:12:51.458
and I… I need to be her. Okay?

1:12:52.250 --> 1:12:54.333
I wanted to be her so badly.

1:12:55.541 --> 1:12:58.916
And I was getting there,
and then all of a sudden, boom.

1:12:59.916 --> 1:13:02.416
Coma. Lights out.

1:13:03.958 --> 1:13:06.458
And I was bloody miserable again.

1:13:08.083 --> 1:13:09.583
Then I thought, "Well…

1:13:13.291 --> 1:13:16.625
I should see if I can prove my mum right."

1:13:20.875 --> 1:13:26.375
"I should… I should really try
and get that perfect life," you know?

1:13:29.250 --> 1:13:32.291
Okay, definitely not just a crown.
Sorry about that. I'm an asshole.

1:13:32.875 --> 1:13:34.208
No, you're…

1:13:34.291 --> 1:13:36.583
-No, you're not.
-All right.

1:13:36.666 --> 1:13:40.333
-Oh!
-Oh! You did it. You got it!

1:13:40.416 --> 1:13:41.750
Oh my God, okay.

1:13:43.166 --> 1:13:45.708
-Yeah!

1:13:45.791 --> 1:13:46.666
Woot, woot.

1:13:47.250 --> 1:13:49.541
-Oh my God!
-That's all yours. You can have that.

1:13:51.291 --> 1:13:54.583
♪ Now it's time to take my place… ♪

1:13:54.666 --> 1:13:56.125
Do you wanna go to prom with me?

1:13:59.750 --> 1:14:01.583
I promise you, you'll have a good time.

1:14:02.083 --> 1:14:06.791
Well, I already signed up
to be a chaperone, so, yeah, I'll go.

1:14:06.875 --> 1:14:07.708
-Yeah?
-Uh-huh.

1:14:08.291 --> 1:14:09.791
-Awesome!

1:14:10.375 --> 1:14:11.875
-Great.
-Yeah.

1:14:11.958 --> 1:14:13.083
Okay. All right. Wait.

1:14:13.166 --> 1:14:15.125
-Let me try to win you something now.
-Okay. Yeah.

1:14:15.208 --> 1:14:17.333
Attention Harding High seniors,

1:14:17.416 --> 1:14:20.875
a petition
was just delivered to me by Bri Balbo,

1:14:21.541 --> 1:14:22.416
I mean, Luvs,

1:14:22.500 --> 1:14:26.166
um, officially reinstating
a king and queen election

1:14:26.250 --> 1:14:27.458
at this year's prom.

1:14:27.541 --> 1:14:29.500
-What? It's back!
-Prom?

1:14:29.583 --> 1:14:31.000
Oh my God!

1:14:31.083 --> 1:14:31.916
Oh my God!

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:34.833
-Shut up!
-Oh my God!

1:14:34.916 --> 1:14:37.708
Obviously, I respect
the sacred privacy of student elections.

1:14:37.791 --> 1:14:41.166
-But I'm totally voting for you.
-Absolutely! Later, prom queen!

1:14:41.250 --> 1:14:42.916
-Love you!

1:14:56.375 --> 1:14:57.625
Can you believe it?

1:14:58.625 --> 1:15:00.375
You might make history after all.

1:15:00.958 --> 1:15:05.291
The first person
to ever lose prom queen twice.

1:15:06.791 --> 1:15:09.208
Don't go chasing waterfalls, Steph.

1:15:09.708 --> 1:15:11.333
-Skank face.
-What was that?

1:15:12.708 --> 1:15:13.833
Oh, nothing.

1:15:15.041 --> 1:15:16.208
Slut bag.

1:15:16.708 --> 1:15:18.166
What did you just call me?

1:15:18.708 --> 1:15:20.291
-Nothing.
-Possum pussy.

1:15:20.375 --> 1:15:22.041
-Rumpel-slut-skin.
-Jizz collector.

1:15:22.125 --> 1:15:23.291
You're a sad wife.

1:15:23.375 --> 1:15:24.541
What did you say?

1:15:26.125 --> 1:15:28.250
I didn't say shit, but you heard me.

1:15:40.416 --> 1:15:41.916
Oh my God.

1:15:42.458 --> 1:15:44.666
It's an invite to a prom party at Bri's.

1:15:44.750 --> 1:15:46.541
-An invite?
-Check your phone!

1:15:47.541 --> 1:15:49.750
Oh my God! I got invited!

1:15:49.833 --> 1:15:51.625
-Can you believe that?
-We got invited!

1:15:51.708 --> 1:15:53.416
-Steve Aoki is DJing.
-Right?

1:15:53.500 --> 1:15:55.250
Steve Aoki? I love it!

1:15:55.333 --> 1:15:56.666
Oh my God!

1:16:00.125 --> 1:16:04.250
Steph. Steph, we're not gonna go probably
'cause, I mean, it's a $50 cover.

1:16:04.333 --> 1:16:06.250
-Oh, yeah.
-That's so expensive.

1:16:06.333 --> 1:16:07.333
I can't afford that.

1:16:07.416 --> 1:16:10.666
Why didn't you tell me we were hosting it?
I'd have got that aphrodisiac wine.

1:16:10.750 --> 1:16:12.166
I didn't know.

1:16:41.125 --> 1:16:41.958
Hi, guys.

1:16:42.041 --> 1:16:43.583
I am so pumped to announce

1:16:43.666 --> 1:16:46.833
that I will be hosting the biggest
and the best prom after-party

1:16:46.916 --> 1:16:48.541
at a supersecret locaish.

1:16:49.041 --> 1:16:51.250
It's free to get in, unlike Bri's.

1:16:52.166 --> 1:16:54.000
It's gonna be awesome.

1:16:54.083 --> 1:16:57.666
So, DM me a picture of your ballot
voting me as prom queen,

1:16:57.750 --> 1:16:59.708
and you'll get all the deets night of.

1:17:04.666 --> 1:17:06.250
This is weird for me too, sir.

1:17:17.875 --> 1:17:18.875
Stephie!

1:17:19.375 --> 1:17:21.208
Wanna hurry it up?

1:17:25.833 --> 1:17:26.875
You want a beer?

1:17:28.083 --> 1:17:30.583
Oh, uh, sure.

1:17:30.666 --> 1:17:33.125
Wrong answer, hot rod.

1:17:33.208 --> 1:17:35.500
You think I'll let you drink
and drive with my daughter?

1:17:36.250 --> 1:17:38.708
Oh, well, I'm actually not driving.
We're taking a Lyft.

1:17:38.791 --> 1:17:40.375
Oh, cool.

1:17:41.416 --> 1:17:44.916
Though I suspect Stephanie would prefer
not to spend her prom evening

1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:46.250
with a drunken fool.

1:17:46.333 --> 1:17:47.666
It would just be the o--

1:17:47.750 --> 1:17:50.750
No, I think I'm okay, actually.
I'll maybe have a water, if anything.

1:17:50.833 --> 1:17:52.750
-Did you bring some condoms?

1:17:54.375 --> 1:17:56.083
Um, no.

1:17:56.166 --> 1:18:00.083
Hm. Didn't think we needed
to have this talk, but, uh, Seth,

1:18:00.166 --> 1:18:04.208
you are aware that unprotected sex
can lead to geriatric pregnancies?

1:18:04.291 --> 1:18:06.291
-Stephie!
-You ready to be an old dad?

1:18:06.375 --> 1:18:08.750
I'm sorry, do you want me
to sleep with your daughter?

1:18:08.833 --> 1:18:10.333
-Or--
-What did you just ask me?

1:18:10.416 --> 1:18:12.333
-It's--
-Okay, I'm ready!

1:18:24.333 --> 1:18:26.291
Mom chose great.

1:18:26.875 --> 1:18:28.083
Yeah.

1:18:29.541 --> 1:18:31.875
-Going to prom.

1:18:31.958 --> 1:18:34.375
-Oh my God. Dad, stop it.
-Don't.

1:18:34.458 --> 1:18:38.083
Dad, stop it. You're embarrassing me.

1:18:38.166 --> 1:18:39.708
A bit higher on the angle.

1:18:39.791 --> 1:18:42.375
Dad, you're taking so many,
but take more, take more.

-Oh my gosh.
-Hey, Steph!

1:19:19.791 --> 1:19:21.000
I'm surprised you're here.

1:19:21.083 --> 1:19:24.875
Aren't you normally on a Saturday night
just home sharpening your teeth?

1:19:25.750 --> 1:19:27.583
You know, I just want to say

1:19:27.666 --> 1:19:31.583
the noble thing would be to do
what the rest of these students are doing

1:19:31.666 --> 1:19:33.708
and vote for Bri.

1:19:33.791 --> 1:19:35.083
Oh.

1:19:35.166 --> 1:19:36.625
-Is that right?
-Mm-hmm.

1:19:36.708 --> 1:19:40.208
Well, I always do the noble thing.

1:19:40.916 --> 1:19:43.916
Vote for Bri.
Is it spelled like the cheese?

1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.250
B, R, I.

1:19:46.333 --> 1:19:47.166
Hmm.

1:19:48.250 --> 1:19:49.208
Interesting.

1:19:50.708 --> 1:19:51.541
Ooh.

1:19:51.625 --> 1:19:52.875
Yep. Right in there.

1:19:52.958 --> 1:19:53.958
There.

1:19:56.166 --> 1:19:57.875
I'm just so confident.

1:20:01.333 --> 1:20:03.833
-Just vote for me.
-Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

1:20:03.916 --> 1:20:05.458
Sethany.

1:20:06.791 --> 1:20:09.208
You know you're not eligible
for prom queen, right?

1:20:09.291 --> 1:20:12.500
That's right, I'm not.
I'm not eligible for prom queen.

1:20:12.583 --> 1:20:15.291
And it's probably killing you
that you aren't either.

1:20:16.416 --> 1:20:17.625
Relax, Tiff.

1:20:18.125 --> 1:20:19.375
I'm just joking.

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.791
-That's funny.
-It's funny. It was a joke. Yeah.

1:20:23.875 --> 1:20:25.750
-It was a joke.

1:20:26.375 --> 1:20:27.625
She's going down.

1:20:29.041 --> 1:20:30.791

1:20:45.250 --> 1:20:49.833
-Oh, you guys look incredible. Amazing!
-Thanks. Wanna go crush the photo booth?

1:20:49.916 --> 1:20:52.166
Oh my God, stop.
You're causing climate change.

1:20:52.250 --> 1:20:55.958
Um, I've got to go and get some votes.
I don't know whether you guys saw,

1:20:56.041 --> 1:20:59.125
but Bri's mom is, like, totally trying
to rig the election.

1:20:59.208 --> 1:21:01.166
Oh! Oh, hell, no!

1:21:01.250 --> 1:21:03.333
I will not stand for voter suppression.

1:21:03.416 --> 1:21:06.291
-We're gonna go help spread the word.
-Storm the cafeteria.

1:21:06.375 --> 1:21:07.375
-Bye.
-See you later?

1:21:07.458 --> 1:21:09.291
Everyone feeling included? Okay.

1:21:09.375 --> 1:21:11.833
There's enough room
on the dance floor for everybody,

1:21:11.916 --> 1:21:16.000
and you don't need a partner to dance.
I usually dance by myself. It's fun.

1:21:22.041 --> 1:21:26.750
Baby, look at me. You know, this is
the dress I won prom queen in. Still fits.

1:21:26.833 --> 1:21:28.875
I almost wore that exact same dress,

1:21:28.958 --> 1:21:30.958
but I'm glad I didn't
because you look phenomenal.

1:21:31.041 --> 1:21:32.666
-Aw.
-What are you doing?

1:21:32.750 --> 1:21:36.791
I am fulfilling my duties
as the president of the PTA,

1:21:36.875 --> 1:21:39.041
overlooking the ballot boxes,

1:21:39.125 --> 1:21:43.708
and something tells me
that you got this in the bag.

1:21:43.791 --> 1:21:44.750
Wink.

1:21:45.541 --> 1:21:49.000
I mean, you can't be
a woke prom queen if you lose.

1:21:49.083 --> 1:21:51.541
Which reminds me, here is a list of brands

1:21:51.625 --> 1:21:54.708
I'd love for you to casually drop
during your acceptance speech.

1:21:54.791 --> 1:21:57.416
Each one could be an additional 10K.

1:21:57.500 --> 1:22:01.041
Don't worry if you can't work in Pep Boys.
It's not really our thing.

1:22:01.125 --> 1:22:05.333
Please just try and remember
this is my prom, not yours.

1:22:12.875 --> 1:22:14.500
-Hey, fam.

1:22:14.583 --> 1:22:18.958
Um, guys, just letting you know
that prom queen voting is still open,

1:22:19.041 --> 1:22:20.458
and I think that something--

1:22:20.541 --> 1:22:21.875
Damn, Conway, you look…

1:22:21.958 --> 1:22:24.416
-…banging.

1:22:25.375 --> 1:22:27.625
Oh my God, you're here. I mean, um…

1:22:29.375 --> 1:22:30.208
You came.

1:22:30.291 --> 1:22:34.666
Of course, I came. I've been waiting
20 years to see you in this dress.

1:22:36.541 --> 1:22:38.166
My God, you look beautiful.

1:22:39.000 --> 1:22:41.708
What is this? You mind if I slip this off?

1:22:41.791 --> 1:22:43.583
-Um--
-You really don't need it.

1:22:44.333 --> 1:22:46.625
I still have a naughty thing
for prom queens, right?

1:22:46.708 --> 1:22:50.416
Well, If I don't get enough votes,
you might be fucking your daughter.

1:22:50.500 --> 1:22:51.583
Huh?

1:22:51.666 --> 1:22:55.375
-No, I wouldn't do that, but…
-No. Obviously. Sorry. Yeah.

1:22:55.458 --> 1:22:56.666
Look at us. We are…

1:22:57.875 --> 1:23:00.666
We're meant to be together.
We're perfect together. Admit it.

1:23:01.375 --> 1:23:02.833
We're made for one another.

1:23:03.375 --> 1:23:04.291
-Blaine?
-Yeah.

1:23:04.375 --> 1:23:06.291
I don't think this is right.
This is a mistake.

1:23:06.375 --> 1:23:08.750
No, no. The mistake was me
asking Tiff to prom. Trust me.

1:23:08.833 --> 1:23:10.666
Wait. No, Blaine. Seriously.

1:23:15.583 --> 1:23:16.583
Seth.

1:23:16.666 --> 1:23:17.541
Seth?

1:23:19.500 --> 1:23:22.416
Hey, Seth. Seth, hey!
I know what that looked like,

1:23:22.500 --> 1:23:24.500
but I promise you,
it's not what you think.

1:23:26.791 --> 1:23:28.541
You teenage-tricked me, Steph.

1:23:29.291 --> 1:23:33.166
And you know what?
It's my fault for believing you changed.

1:23:35.375 --> 1:23:39.875
Okay, class of 2022,
it's the big moment!

1:23:39.958 --> 1:23:44.166
Okay, so the reason that we're all here
and the only reason we all came tonight…

1:23:44.250 --> 1:23:46.166
-No.
-…is because-- No, it is.

1:23:46.250 --> 1:23:51.708
…is because I have the results
of our prom elections.

1:23:55.125 --> 1:23:59.250
By a unanimous vote, our 2022 prom king is

1:24:00.166 --> 1:24:01.583
Lance Harrison.

1:24:11.291 --> 1:24:13.250
Oh my God!

1:24:13.916 --> 1:24:18.083
And the winner of prom queen
received over 1,000 votes

1:24:18.166 --> 1:24:21.583
despite there only being 327 of you.

1:24:21.666 --> 1:24:23.708
However, she has just informed us

1:24:23.791 --> 1:24:26.541
that she has withdrawn
from the competition.

1:24:26.625 --> 1:24:27.625
What?

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.541
-Okay, so…
-Bri.

1:24:31.625 --> 1:24:34.500
…the 2022 prom queen will go to…

1:24:37.458 --> 1:24:38.916
Stephanie Conway.

1:24:48.458 --> 1:24:50.375
There's been a mistake. No, no, no.

1:24:52.083 --> 1:24:54.541
-Go, Steph! I can't believe it!

1:24:55.625 --> 1:24:56.458
God!

1:24:56.541 --> 1:25:01.541
Stephanie!
Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie!

1:25:01.625 --> 1:25:03.041
Stephanie!

1:25:03.125 --> 1:25:04.416
Stephanie!

1:25:04.500 --> 1:25:05.500
No! No!

1:25:05.583 --> 1:25:08.791
Stephanie!
Stephanie! Stephanie! Stephanie!

1:25:21.416 --> 1:25:25.833

And spoiler alert, party favors
are Beats by Dre headphones!

1:27:28.916 --> 1:27:30.833
Bri, will you tell them?

1:27:30.916 --> 1:27:34.750
Hey, everyone, after-party
is at Steph's place. See you there.

1:27:34.833 --> 1:27:37.791
Wait, what are you doing?
The house is ready for the party.

1:27:37.875 --> 1:27:41.500
I mean, Steve Aoki is in our living room.
What am I going to tell him?

1:27:41.583 --> 1:27:44.250
I don't know.
Tell him you lost prom queen.

1:27:47.333 --> 1:27:48.708
Shit. Shit.

1:27:58.208 --> 1:28:01.250
Drink! Drink!
Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

1:28:01.333 --> 1:28:02.541
No!

1:28:06.833 --> 1:28:10.625
Yes, hi. I'd like to report
a rowdy high school party

1:28:10.708 --> 1:28:13.000
with tons of underage drinking.

1:28:13.583 --> 1:28:15.000
And-- Oh my God!

1:28:15.750 --> 1:28:18.333
I think an adult is hosting it.

1:28:27.291 --> 1:28:28.125
Yeah!

1:28:28.625 --> 1:28:29.791
Hey!

1:28:29.875 --> 1:28:30.750
Hey, Janet!

1:28:31.333 --> 1:28:32.208
Come on!

1:28:32.291 --> 1:28:34.125
-No, don't film me!
-Why?

1:28:34.208 --> 1:28:36.500
The media will use it
to try and discredit me.

1:28:39.833 --> 1:28:40.666
Wait, no.

1:28:40.750 --> 1:28:43.291
-Fuck it! Fuck it! Film me! Film me!
-Okay. Okay.

1:28:43.375 --> 1:28:47.208
Yeah, come on, yeah.
That's right. It's the president, bitch!

1:28:47.291 --> 1:28:49.208
-Yeah!
-Suck my vulva!

1:28:56.000 --> 1:28:58.166
Oh my God, whose tooth is this?

1:28:58.250 --> 1:28:59.541
-Oh shit.

1:28:59.625 --> 1:29:01.125
Cops!

1:29:02.750 --> 1:29:05.625
-Where? Wait. Okay, wait--
-Bye, Stephanie.

1:29:05.708 --> 1:29:07.291
No. Oh my God.

1:29:23.875 --> 1:29:27.041
Oh my God, Martha,
I was just about to call you.

1:29:27.125 --> 1:29:31.166
Steph, what in ever living fuck
were you thinking?

1:29:32.291 --> 1:29:36.083
-You said I could use the house.
-Are you kidding? Twenty years ago.

1:29:36.166 --> 1:29:39.166
And even then,
I didn't want you to use it.

1:29:39.250 --> 1:29:42.041
-Did you even think about me?

1:29:42.125 --> 1:29:44.666
This is all kinds of illegal.

1:29:44.750 --> 1:29:47.333
Oh my God, they're gonna make
a Netflix documentary about me.

1:29:47.416 --> 1:29:50.791
Well, wait. Okay, think about that.
That could be really cool.

1:29:50.875 --> 1:29:52.791
That… that could be epic.

1:29:52.875 --> 1:29:54.916
Look how well it turned out
for Tiger King.

1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:56.041
No.

1:29:56.125 --> 1:30:00.166
No, it's not epic or cool.

1:30:00.250 --> 1:30:02.416
God, you're the same as in high school.

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:05.708
-So you don't want a drink?
-No, I don't want a drink!

1:30:06.625 --> 1:30:08.333
You need to grow up!

1:30:08.916 --> 1:30:10.250
You're not a teenager!

1:30:10.333 --> 1:30:13.833
I know I'm not. I'm an adult.
Is that what you want to hear?

1:30:14.333 --> 1:30:18.000
Yes, I am a 37-year-old 12th grader.

1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:25.541
You don't think I know how crazy it is
going back to high school in this body?

1:30:26.291 --> 1:30:29.083
What else was I supposed to do?

1:30:29.166 --> 1:30:32.375
-What else did I have?
-You had me, and you had Seth.

1:30:32.958 --> 1:30:35.708
Everybody else just got to go on
and live their lives.

1:30:35.791 --> 1:30:37.583
I'm supposed to just jump forward?

1:30:37.666 --> 1:30:40.750
I'm just not allowed
to ever make mistakes?

1:30:40.833 --> 1:30:43.166
Making mistakes is different

1:30:43.250 --> 1:30:46.125
than willfully screwing over
the people who care about you.

1:30:47.208 --> 1:30:48.708
You pushed us away.

1:30:49.625 --> 1:30:52.708
They were not your friends.
We were your friends.

1:30:53.333 --> 1:30:55.250
We were the ones who cared about you.

1:30:55.333 --> 1:30:57.458
We were the ones
who showed up at the hospital.

1:30:57.541 --> 1:30:59.375
They never came to the hospital.
None of them.

1:30:59.458 --> 1:31:01.541
I can't believe you would say that.

1:31:02.333 --> 1:31:04.291
I got tons of birthday cards.

1:31:04.375 --> 1:31:06.291
Did you even look
to see who they were from?

1:31:11.583 --> 1:31:13.750
Help. Oh God.

1:31:14.375 --> 1:31:15.458
Was that curry?

1:31:15.541 --> 1:31:17.708
I'm done. You can find your own way home.

1:31:22.958 --> 1:31:24.166
Hey, Seth.

1:31:32.416 --> 1:31:33.583
Finally.

1:31:33.666 --> 1:31:35.666
I saw you followed Stephanie on Insta.

1:31:35.750 --> 1:31:39.166
Don't you wanna know if I got arrested
at that party you called the cops on?

1:31:39.250 --> 1:31:40.166
I know it was you.

1:31:40.250 --> 1:31:44.000
Do you think I do this stuff for fun?
I'm looking out for you.

1:31:44.083 --> 1:31:46.125
We could have made
a hundred grand tonight.

1:31:46.208 --> 1:31:49.208
We could've used that money
as a donation to get you into college.

1:31:49.291 --> 1:31:51.708
So you could blog
about being an Ivy League mom?

1:31:51.791 --> 1:31:54.083
Oh well, I guess
I'll have to get in myself.

1:31:54.166 --> 1:31:57.500
I want you to have the perfect life,

1:31:58.083 --> 1:31:58.916
like me.

1:31:59.500 --> 1:32:02.708
The perfect life online means nothing
when you're miserable in real life.

1:32:02.791 --> 1:32:05.166
We are not miserable.

1:32:05.250 --> 1:32:06.125
Yeah, we are.

1:32:07.250 --> 1:32:09.583
And you're right, Mom.

1:32:09.666 --> 1:32:12.416
No elite person
follows more than 100 people.

1:32:13.041 --> 1:32:14.666
So you gotta go.

1:32:14.750 --> 1:32:17.333
-You are toast.

1:32:17.416 --> 1:32:18.875
Hey, your family's fucked up.

1:32:18.958 --> 1:32:21.333
Are we doing this?
I got another gig in an hour.

1:32:21.416 --> 1:32:23.791
You know what? Fuck you, Steve Aoki.

1:32:23.875 --> 1:32:26.875

Holy shit, Deanna Russo?

1:32:41.833 --> 1:32:44.041
Yeah. Do we know each other?

1:32:44.541 --> 1:32:47.708
Oh my God. No. I… I mean…
Well, I know who you are.

1:32:47.791 --> 1:32:49.541
You're a legend at Harding High.

1:32:49.625 --> 1:32:51.750
You won prom queen and had a perfect life.

1:32:51.833 --> 1:32:53.500
Perfect life?

1:32:54.250 --> 1:32:57.208
Yeah. Uh, let's see, um…

1:32:57.291 --> 1:33:01.500
I was divorced before I was 30
when my husband left me

1:33:01.583 --> 1:33:05.666
for a 21-year-old barista
with two more abs than I had.

1:33:05.750 --> 1:33:10.541
And I was left with no credit
and no job prospects.

1:33:11.416 --> 1:33:14.500
My advice, throw that crown away now.

1:33:15.083 --> 1:33:16.666
You know what prom queen got me?

1:33:16.750 --> 1:33:18.416
An even spray tan

1:33:18.500 --> 1:33:22.375
and the ability to dodge bleach poisoning
every time I get my hair done.

1:33:22.458 --> 1:33:24.250
Well, I mean, that is a skill.

1:33:25.541 --> 1:33:26.416
Yeah.

1:33:27.083 --> 1:33:33.666
But, uh, imagine all the other skills
I would have had if I'd gone to college.

1:33:33.750 --> 1:33:35.500
I don't know where I would be,

1:33:36.041 --> 1:33:39.208
but I do know it wouldn't be
taking courses at the community college

1:33:39.291 --> 1:33:42.375
while hustling
to make rent between two jobs.

1:33:42.458 --> 1:33:46.458
The only thing I look forward to
is taking my pants off at night.

1:33:46.541 --> 1:33:48.250
Oh my God. I do that too now.

1:33:48.333 --> 1:33:50.708
-It's so good, right?
-Yeah. Just like…

1:33:50.791 --> 1:33:53.375
-Yeah.

1:33:53.458 --> 1:33:57.583
But it's all worth it
'cause I am going to get a degree,

1:33:57.666 --> 1:34:02.166
and I am going to have a career,
and that is everything.

1:34:02.750 --> 1:34:06.708
And for the first time in my life,
I'm excited about the future

1:34:07.291 --> 1:34:09.416

Oh, come on. Sit down with me.
Have breakfast with your old dad.

1:35:39.708 --> 1:35:42.625
Do you know
where you're sitting at graduation yet?

1:35:43.833 --> 1:35:44.708
On my butt?

1:35:47.416 --> 1:35:49.458
I just wanna get a good seat
so I can see you.

1:35:51.875 --> 1:35:53.708
I'm not gonna go to graduation, Dad.

1:35:53.791 --> 1:35:55.458
Seth and Martha won't talk to me,

1:35:55.541 --> 1:35:57.791
and I don't think
anybody else wants me there.

1:35:57.875 --> 1:35:59.208
Well, I want you there.

1:35:59.791 --> 1:36:00.833
That doesn't count.

1:36:01.416 --> 1:36:02.333
Yes, it does.

1:36:03.958 --> 1:36:05.083
I count.

1:36:06.041 --> 1:36:10.083
I know you used to roll your eyes
whenever Mom would compliment you,

1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:14.041
tell you how amazing,
beautiful, wonderful you were,

1:36:14.625 --> 1:36:16.750
like she had to say it 'cause she was Mom,

1:36:18.291 --> 1:36:19.750
but she wanted to

1:36:20.416 --> 1:36:22.666
because she believed it, deeply.

1:36:25.083 --> 1:36:28.041
One of the last things
she said to me was to make sure

1:36:28.833 --> 1:36:31.291
that you knew how to receive love.

1:36:32.083 --> 1:36:35.916
And I spent every day of your coma
wondering if I messed up,

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:39.250
so… let me be clear.

1:36:41.208 --> 1:36:45.166
Don't waste your time
telling the people who love you the most

1:36:45.250 --> 1:36:46.666
that they don't count.

1:36:47.625 --> 1:36:50.125
They are the only ones that count.

1:36:53.208 --> 1:36:54.250
Thanks, Dad.

1:36:55.583 --> 1:36:56.458
Yeah.

1:37:01.833 --> 1:37:05.250
Okay, I know I have
some things to clear up, so…

1:37:07.041 --> 1:37:09.125
I thought this is gonna be the best way.

1:37:09.208 --> 1:37:12.958
Guys, I fucked up.
And I really need to apologize.

1:37:13.041 --> 1:37:15.916
First of all, I've been
a really dodgy friend

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:18.583
to the two people
who care about me the most,

1:37:18.666 --> 1:37:23.291
the people who supported me when I was
just that dorky kid fresh from Australia,

1:37:24.041 --> 1:37:28.500
the ones who stayed by my side,
even when I majorly neglected them,

1:37:29.416 --> 1:37:32.666
the ones who,
for some reason, never gave up on me.

1:37:32.750 --> 1:37:36.500
It doesn't matter who has
the most friends or likes or followers.

1:37:36.583 --> 1:37:38.958
If you just have one or two great friends

1:37:39.041 --> 1:37:41.875
who will support you
even when you're being a butt slut,

1:37:41.958 --> 1:37:43.375
then you've got it all.

1:37:44.166 --> 1:37:46.333
And that is something worth fighting for,

1:37:46.416 --> 1:37:48.416
so fuck what other people think.

1:37:48.500 --> 1:37:51.958
Yeah, like, fuck being popular.
Fuck being cool.

1:37:52.041 --> 1:37:53.625
Fuck it in the ass.

1:37:53.708 --> 1:37:55.333
Stephie, language.

1:37:55.958 --> 1:37:59.708
I never planned on taking
two decades to graduate, obvi,

1:37:59.791 --> 1:38:02.666
but the class of 2022
showed me something that

1:38:02.750 --> 1:38:05.333
I could never have learned
when I was in high school the first time.

1:38:05.416 --> 1:38:06.833
We have a school archive!

1:38:07.500 --> 1:38:12.666
And that is every single one of us
is so unique, and that's awesome.

1:38:12.750 --> 1:38:15.041
Why fit in when you can stand out?

1:38:15.916 --> 1:38:19.416
And so, okay, now I'm gonna do something

1:38:19.500 --> 1:38:22.458
that I wish I had
the confidence to do 20 years ago,

1:38:23.083 --> 1:38:25.083
and that is being my real self.

1:38:25.750 --> 1:38:28.958
And yeah, I'm still afraid that
if I show everyone my real self,

1:38:29.041 --> 1:38:30.916
the wrong people will make fun of me.

1:38:31.416 --> 1:38:34.041
But it's the only way
for the right people to see me.

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.125
And they're the ones
I care about the most.

1:38:40.875 --> 1:38:44.458
They're the ones I want,
more than anything, to forgive me.

1:38:56.833 --> 1:38:59.541
Dad, stop. Stop it.

1:38:59.625 --> 1:39:00.916
That's it.

1:39:01.833 --> 1:39:03.416
Dad, just stop it! Press stop.

1:39:03.500 --> 1:39:05.250
-Sorry.

1:39:05.333 --> 1:39:06.875
That was beautiful.

1:39:09.625 --> 1:39:10.458
Tiff.

1:39:10.541 --> 1:39:15.500
My daughter
won't, um, unblock me unless…

1:39:16.958 --> 1:39:18.250
I came to apologize to you.

1:39:19.333 --> 1:39:21.041
-Seriously?
-So…

1:39:21.125 --> 1:39:22.000
Um…

1:39:23.083 --> 1:39:26.208
I am sorry for everything I've done

1:39:27.083 --> 1:39:31.208
and for treating you
like human garbage all these years.

1:39:31.291 --> 1:39:34.166
Tiff, I'm not the one you should be trying
to make things right with.

1:39:34.875 --> 1:39:37.125
You and Blaine have an awesome daughter

1:39:37.208 --> 1:39:41.458
who's so smart and way cooler
than what you and I ever were.

1:39:43.291 --> 1:39:44.958
Stop competing with her.

1:39:45.541 --> 1:39:47.458
There's enough room for both of you.

1:39:48.083 --> 1:39:50.000
There's enough room for all of us.

1:39:50.500 --> 1:39:52.458
We don't need to fight with each other.

1:39:53.791 --> 1:39:54.625
You're right.

1:39:55.458 --> 1:39:59.000
I am really sorry, Stephanie,

1:39:59.750 --> 1:40:00.708
for…

1:40:02.708 --> 1:40:03.541
everything.

1:40:06.416 --> 1:40:07.291
Yeah.

1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:10.541
Apology accepted.

1:40:13.500 --> 1:40:14.958
-Okay.
-Tiff, wait, um…

1:40:15.750 --> 1:40:18.375
I never let a guest leave
without a gift.

1:40:19.750 --> 1:40:21.166
-Hang on.
-That is…

1:40:21.250 --> 1:40:24.083
-Just wait… wait one second.
-…so cute.

1:40:27.458 --> 1:40:28.500
That's for you.

1:40:32.375 --> 1:40:34.791
-Thank you so much. Thank you.
-Thanks for coming over.

1:40:34.875 --> 1:40:36.416
Lance Harrison.

1:40:39.250 --> 1:40:40.916
Oh my God.

1:40:46.583 --> 1:40:49.791
-I just wanna say thanks to my grandma--
-No, no, no, no.

1:40:49.875 --> 1:40:52.833
Just so everybody knows,
nobody else do that. Okay.

1:40:53.333 --> 1:40:55.500
Britney Jean Balbo.

1:40:59.375 --> 1:41:01.208
-Yes, Bri!
-Go, baby!

1:41:01.291 --> 1:41:02.333
Go, Bri!

1:41:04.916 --> 1:41:06.166


1:41:09.166 --> 1:41:11.500
Stephanie Marie Conway.

1:41:13.416 --> 1:41:15.583
That's my daughter!

1:41:23.625 --> 1:41:24.875
Um, oh…

1:41:25.666 --> 1:41:28.666
Here. To pay
for all the damage at the lake house.

1:41:28.750 --> 1:41:30.125
Where did you get this from?

1:41:30.208 --> 1:41:32.625
I sold the Cabriolet.
Time to grow up.

1:41:33.208 --> 1:41:35.458
Aw.

1:41:35.541 --> 1:41:36.958
I am so proud of you.

1:41:37.041 --> 1:41:38.166
Aw, thanks, Marth.

1:41:39.000 --> 1:41:40.541
I'm so lucky to have you as a friend.

1:41:48.375 --> 1:41:49.333
Congrats, Steph.

1:41:50.000 --> 1:41:50.833
Thanks.

1:41:50.916 --> 1:41:53.333
Now, to end our ceremony,
I'd like to invite

1:41:53.416 --> 1:41:57.666
our 2022 class valedictorian, Janet Singh.

1:42:00.166 --> 1:42:01.833
-After you.
-Thank you!

1:42:05.083 --> 1:42:06.250
Go, Janet!

1:42:08.583 --> 1:42:10.208
Okay, listen up.

1:42:10.291 --> 1:42:14.375
It is hot as hell,
and this ceremony is way too long.

1:42:14.458 --> 1:42:16.666
So I'm just gonna say one thing.

1:42:16.750 --> 1:42:19.791
Who you are in high school
doesn't define you.

1:42:20.666 --> 1:42:23.166
And I would also like
to officially announce

1:42:23.250 --> 1:42:25.583
my campaign for US president.

1:42:25.666 --> 1:42:27.583
Vote for me in 2040.

1:42:28.125 --> 1:42:29.125
Yay!

1:42:32.166 --> 1:42:35.916
And lastly,
I have one question for all of you.
