06:05.199 --> 06:06.198
that you're taking

06:06.200 --> 06:07.232
performance-enhancing drugs,

06:07.234 --> 06:08.200
the integrity of the game

06:08.202 --> 06:09.201
is completely compromised,

06:09.203 --> 06:10.202
all right?

06:10.204 --> 06:11.203
>> Shit.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.237
>> As the Bud Selig of the

06:12.239 --> 06:13.505
group, it's my job to quietly

06:13.507 --> 06:14.473
sweep this under the rug before

06:14.475 --> 06:15.507
anybody finds out.

06:15.509 --> 06:16.475
>> You know, Commissioner, you

06:16.477 --> 06:17.476
just... you kind of just lost

06:17.478 --> 06:18.210
the chugging contest...

06:18.212 --> 06:19.144
>> Go.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.078
("Take Me Out to the Ball Game"

06:20.080 --> 06:22.147
plays)

06:24.818 --> 06:26.051
>> Hey!

06:26.053 --> 06:27.686
You know, I actually went to

06:27.688 --> 06:29.721
school at the same college, your

06:29.723 --> 06:31.056
alma mater, in 1966.

06:31.058 --> 06:31.890
>> Yeah?

06:31.892 --> 06:32.991
>> Yeah, here, have a beer, huh?

06:32.993 --> 06:33.825
It's like...

06:33.827 --> 06:34.693
>> Oh, that's nice of you.

06:34.695 --> 06:35.560
>> Yeah, yeah, good, yeah.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.662
Drink up.

06:37.664 --> 06:38.830
>> Frank?

06:38.832 --> 06:39.765
Did you just buy frat boy a

06:39.767 --> 06:40.732
beer?

06:40.734 --> 06:41.767
>> Don't worry about it.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.602
I laced it with sleeping pills.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.770
He's gonna be out like a light

06:44.772 --> 06:45.737
in two minutes.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.038
>> That is some diabolical shit,

06:47.040 --> 06:47.873
dude.

06:47.875 --> 06:48.774
>> Ow...!

06:48.776 --> 06:49.775
(Dennis laughs)

06:49.777 --> 06:50.742
So what's going on with the sex

06:50.744 --> 06:51.543
moves?

06:51.544 --> 06:52.343
I've been laying chum up and

06:52.346 --> 06:53.178
down this plane.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.079
>> Yeah, I-I know.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.113
I've noticed.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.047
Yeah, I've got my prey picked

06:56.049 --> 06:56.882
out.

06:56.883 --> 06:57.716
I'm just waiting for the right

06:57.718 --> 06:58.517
moment to pounce.

06:58.519 --> 06:59.451
>> What are you talking about?

06:59.453 --> 07:00.385
You haven't moved an inch.

07:00.387 --> 07:01.253
You're just drinking.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.387
>> Oh, is that what you think?

07:02.389 --> 07:03.288
>> Mm-hmm.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.523
>> Frank, of the 206 passengers

07:04.525 --> 07:05.791
on this flight, 98 of them are

07:05.793 --> 07:08.059
women, but only one of them is a

07:08.061 --> 07:11.463
suitable candidate: 44G.

07:11.465 --> 07:14.032
Notice how she glances forlornly

07:14.034 --> 07:15.400
at the empty seat next to her.

07:15.402 --> 07:16.768
It was meant for someone

07:16.770 --> 07:18.703
special.

07:18.705 --> 07:19.771
And the tan line on her ring

07:19.773 --> 07:21.473
finger suggests the wound is

07:21.475 --> 07:23.375
still fresh, leaving her

07:23.377 --> 07:24.976
vulnerable.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.077
Furthermore, when we hit

07:26.079 --> 07:27.479
turbulence earlier, she giggled,

07:27.481 --> 07:28.780
telling me she's a bit of a

07:28.782 --> 07:29.948
thrill seeker.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.316
>> You think she offed the guy

07:31.318 --> 07:32.784
and went on the run?

07:32.786 --> 07:33.919
>> Pretty tough to lay low in a

07:33.921 --> 07:35.320
dress like that.

07:35.322 --> 07:37.789
Granted, it's not a particularly

07:37.791 --> 07:39.090
remarkable garment.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.158
It's from the J.Crew Spring 2012

07:40.160 --> 07:41.660
collection.

07:41.662 --> 07:42.961
Although, it is a bit much for

07:42.963 --> 07:44.563
an airplane.

07:44.565 --> 07:45.630
Furthermore, if she were

07:45.632 --> 07:46.798
standing, you'd notice she's got

07:46.800 --> 07:48.400
no panty line, giving me about

07:48.402 --> 07:49.801
five extra seconds to enter her

07:49.803 --> 07:51.470
swiftly before she realizes I am

07:51.472 --> 07:54.172
not the answer to her problems.

07:54.174 --> 07:57.008
(laughs)

07:57.010 --> 07:58.743
>> I'll tell you my tastes lie a

07:58.745 --> 08:02.447
little bit more in 39F.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.816
>> No.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.751
No, thank you, Frank.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.919
No, her blouse is covered in

08:07.921 --> 08:09.254
cigarette burns.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.655
And I imagine underneath that

08:10.657 --> 08:11.756
blouse, you'll find copious

08:11.758 --> 08:13.024
amounts of road rash, probably

08:13.026 --> 08:14.459
sustained in some sort of

08:14.461 --> 08:15.794
off-roading accident, which

08:15.796 --> 08:18.763
would also explain her limp.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.365
Although, something tells me the

08:20.367 --> 08:21.533
two are unrelated.

08:21.535 --> 08:22.634
Either way, she's North Dakota

08:22.636 --> 08:23.835
trash through and through and

08:23.837 --> 08:24.870
far beneath a gentleman such as

08:24.872 --> 08:26.271
myself.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.806
Uh, miss?

08:27.808 --> 08:30.075
Six more beers.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.548
(groans)

08:36.550 --> 08:37.616
>> Hey-oh!

08:37.618 --> 08:39.184
>> Ah, there we go. Yeah.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.318
>> Hey, listen, Charlie?

08:40.320 --> 08:41.319
>> Yeah.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.821
>> I need you to start a

08:42.823 --> 08:44.723
McGwire/Sosa-like rivalry with

08:44.725 --> 08:46.024
Dee.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.158
>> Look, I think you're getting,

08:47.160 --> 08:48.159
like, too worked up about this

08:48.161 --> 08:49.160
thing.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.195
Can we just drink the beer and

08:50.197 --> 08:51.196
hang out, you know?

08:51.198 --> 08:52.163
>> Well, here-here's the thing.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.198
The game seems to be getting a

08:53.200 --> 08:54.165
little bit off the rails.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.200
Frank and Dennis are super

08:55.202 --> 08:56.167
distracted and Dee is kind of

08:56.169 --> 08:57.168
just running away with it.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.169
>> Boggsy didn't drink six

08:58.171 --> 08:59.538
gallons of beer because he was

08:59.540 --> 09:00.572
obsessed with, like, breaking

09:00.574 --> 09:01.640
some record.

09:01.642 --> 09:02.641
You know what I mean?

09:02.643 --> 09:03.842
He did it 'cause he was just,

09:03.844 --> 09:05.744
like, thirsty, you know?

09:05.746 --> 09:06.745
And looking to pass the time.

09:06.747 --> 09:07.846
>> Yeah, but I can sell a

09:07.848 --> 09:09.047
rivalry, all right?

09:09.049 --> 09:10.482
What I can't sell is... 27

09:10.484 --> 09:11.516
beers.

09:11.518 --> 09:12.484
What-what am I gonna do with 27

09:12.486 --> 09:13.518
beers?

09:13.520 --> 09:14.486
Who-who cares about 27 beers?

09:14.488 --> 09:15.520
>> We're not selling anything.

09:15.522 --> 09:16.521
Like, I think you're taking

09:16.523 --> 09:17.422
the commissioner thing way...

09:17.424 --> 09:18.523
Look, you lost the chugging

09:18.525 --> 09:19.491
contest, man.

09:19.493 --> 09:20.492
It's not a big deal.

09:20.494 --> 09:21.526
>> Why did you make me Bud Selig

09:21.528 --> 09:22.494
if you didn't...?

09:22.496 --> 09:23.528
>> Nobody did.

09:23.530 --> 09:24.496
You just started saying that.

09:24.498 --> 09:25.497
Look, I got empties for you.

09:25.499 --> 09:26.531
Just take those and don't, like,

09:26.533 --> 09:27.499
put so much pressure on

09:27.501 --> 09:28.533
yourself over...

09:28.535 --> 09:29.501
>> Attention, passengers.

09:29.503 --> 09:31.102
This is your captain, Boss Hogg,

09:31.104 --> 09:32.070
speaking.

09:32.072 --> 09:33.071
And this cold slice of heaven is

09:33.073 --> 09:34.506
my 40th beer of the afternoon.

09:34.508 --> 09:36.341
So any of you dicknips think you

09:36.343 --> 09:38.443
can slug it down faster than me,

09:38.445 --> 09:39.911
you're welcome to get your fat

09:39.913 --> 09:40.912
asses up here to try. Uh-uh!

09:40.914 --> 09:41.947
>> Yeah, no.

09:41.949 --> 09:42.914
>> Uh-uh!

09:42.916 --> 09:43.949
>> Put your...

09:43.951 --> 09:44.950
>> Uh-uh!

09:44.952 --> 09:45.951
>> Oh, I'm gonna need that.

09:45.953 --> 09:46.718
>> Ah, you... ruining

09:46.720 --> 09:47.252
everything.

09:47.254 --> 09:47.953
>> Okay.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.020
The Boggs group is cut off.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.021
(Mac groans)

09:50.023 --> 09:51.022
>> What? Aw, dude.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.023
That's not good.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.058
I can't stop drinking now.

09:53.060 --> 09:54.059
>> Damn it!

09:54.061 --> 09:55.026
>> I'll probably die, dude.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.394
>> I'm running low, too. Shit.

09:56.396 --> 09:58.229
Okay, luckily I came prepared.

09:58.231 --> 09:59.397
>> Oh, yeah?

09:59.399 --> 10:00.599
>> Yeah.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.600
>> Charlie, we're not on a

10:01.602 --> 10:03.034
wide-body DC-10 for nothing.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.903
>> Right. We bought tickets.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.304
>> Well, yes, but we chose a

10:06.306 --> 10:07.872
wide-body DC-10 on purpose.

10:07.874 --> 10:09.040
That's what I was...

10:09.042 --> 10:10.875
>> To get up in the sky.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.210
>> Let me walk you through it.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.412
I got a hundred extra beers in a

10:14.414 --> 10:15.981
checked bag, okay?

10:15.983 --> 10:17.082
Now, according to movies like

10:17.084 --> 10:18.283
<i> Executive Decision</i> and

10:18.285 --> 10:19.618

me to travel freely throughout

10:22.422 --> 10:23.888
the aircraft.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.090
>> Well, everybody knows that.

10:25.092 --> 10:26.091
>> Yeah, so I just got to find

10:26.093 --> 10:28.460
my right time to get down there.

10:28.462 --> 10:29.461
>> I think you can probably go,

10:29.463 --> 10:30.462
like, anytime, yeah.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.463
>> Or just do it... just

This way, I'm sitting here.

take care of him.

kill him.

11:15.475 --> 11:16.474
Well, you better go do

12:08.061 --> 12:09.761
>> Oh, you really know your way

12:09.763 --> 12:10.829
around.

12:10.831 --> 12:11.830
>> Well, if I've learned

12:11.832 --> 12:12.864
anything from films like

12:12.866 --> 12:14.032
<i>Executive Decision</i> or<i> Passenger</i>

12:14.034 --> 12:15.333
<i> 57,</i> there's always a way into

12:15.335 --> 12:16.668
the cargo hold.

12:16.670 --> 12:17.936
>> You're weird.

12:17.938 --> 12:19.037
>> You have no idea.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.038
>> Oh...

12:20.040 --> 12:21.039
>> Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12:21.041 --> 12:22.040
Nothing with my lips, all right?

12:22.042 --> 12:23.074
>> Okay.

12:23.076 --> 12:24.042
>> I don't want to do that with

12:24.044 --> 12:25.076
you.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.077
>> Mind if I take a pill?

12:26.079 --> 12:28.113
>> Yeah, sure, take a pill.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.083
(sniffs)

12:32.085 --> 12:33.752
>> All right, well, that's

12:33.754 --> 12:35.053
happening.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.087
(grunting)

12:36.089 --> 12:37.122
>> Now, just do that.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.223
That's a boy!

12:38.225 --> 12:39.557
>> Is it really necessary to

12:39.559 --> 12:40.959
restrain him like this?

12:40.961 --> 12:42.761
>> You can never be too careful

12:42.763 --> 12:45.029
with altitude sickness.

12:45.031 --> 12:46.731
One time, this broad chewed

12:46.733 --> 12:49.801
through the fuselage of a 747!

12:49.803 --> 12:51.636
Luckily, I'm a pilot, too.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.371
I inverted the bird and landed

12:53.373 --> 12:56.775
her safely in an open field.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.476
>> Okay, I'm sorry.

12:58.478 --> 12:59.544
I'm gonna need to see some

12:59.546 --> 13:00.979
identification.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.614
>> You don't think I'm a pilot?

13:02.616 --> 13:03.782
>> I don't think you're a

13:03.784 --> 13:05.116
doctor.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.586
>> That is a serious accusation!

13:08.588 --> 13:10.455
>> You've had 14 beers.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.090
>> You don't know that.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.958
>> It's written on your shirt.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.561
(Frank grunts)

13:16.563 --> 13:17.729
>> How would you like to go to

13:17.731 --> 13:19.063
the bathroom with me?

13:19.065 --> 13:20.231
>> I got to go.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.566
>> You and me?

13:21.568 --> 13:23.434
>> Well, Frank, I have

13:23.436 --> 13:24.936
singlehandedly pushed the limits

13:24.938 --> 13:26.271
of high-altitude eroticism.

13:26.273 --> 13:27.272
>> You banged her?

13:27.274 --> 13:28.273
>> Yeah.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.274
>> What happened to the classy

13:29.276 --> 13:30.308
broad?

13:30.310 --> 13:31.609
>> Oh, happily married. Yeah.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.011
Turns out she takes her ring off

13:33.013 --> 13:34.279
when she flies 'cause her

13:34.281 --> 13:35.780
fingers swell. Yeah.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.115
But it-it's all good, Frank.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.249
You know, hey, turns out Boggs,

13:38.251 --> 13:39.284
he didn't hit it out of the park

13:39.286 --> 13:40.318
every single time at bat.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.319
>> Mm-hmm.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.320
>> He just tried to get the ball

13:42.322 --> 13:43.488
in play and hope that he could

13:43.490 --> 13:44.656
squeak it through the hole.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.623
And I just, uh, squeaked it

13:45.625 --> 13:46.524
through multiple holes if you

13:46.526 --> 13:47.525
know what I'm saying.

13:47.527 --> 13:48.459
(Lizzie laughs)

13:48.461 --> 13:49.661
Don't you!

13:49.663 --> 13:50.829
>> Ladies and gentlemen, please

13:50.831 --> 13:52.163
fasten your seat belts as we

13:52.165 --> 13:53.431
begin our initial descent into

13:53.433 --> 13:54.666
North Dakota.

13:54.668 --> 13:55.667
>> Oh, shit. Well, you know, you

13:55.669 --> 13:56.701
heard the captain.

13:56.703 --> 13:57.702
On your bike.

13:57.704 --> 13:58.670
>> I wish I could just sit with

13:58.672 --> 13:59.704
you.

13:59.706 --> 14:00.672
>> Yeah. Hmm.

14:00.674 --> 14:01.706
But, you know, there's already a

14:01.708 --> 14:03.274
guy in the seat, so...

14:03.276 --> 14:05.710
>> Oh. Excuse me, Mr. Person,

14:05.712 --> 14:07.178
would you mind switching seats

14:07.180 --> 14:08.513
so I could sit with my

14:08.515 --> 14:10.615
boyfriend?

14:10.617 --> 14:12.784
Thank you.

14:12.786 --> 14:14.118
(laughs)

14:14.120 --> 14:16.454
(taps on seat)

14:16.456 --> 14:17.555
("Take Me Out to the Ball Game"

14:17.557 --> 14:19.624
plays)

14:23.129 --> 14:26.064
>> Hello, Charlie.

14:26.066 --> 14:27.966
>> Oh, shit!

14:27.968 --> 14:29.367
You're the ghost of Wade Boggs!

14:29.369 --> 14:30.501
>> I'm not a ghost, Charlie.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.070
You're just hallucinating.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.905
You've had over 30 beers, dude!

14:33.907 --> 14:35.373
>> Uh, you did? Nice, man.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.407
>> You know, your friend Mac

14:36.409 --> 14:37.375
is right.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.376
>> Oh, yeah?

14:38.378 --> 14:39.644
>> I didn't win five batting

14:39.646 --> 14:41.045
titles because it was fun.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.180
>> Right.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.147
>> I won it because I wanted to

14:43.149 --> 14:44.415
be the best.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.717
You see what I'm saying?

14:45.719 --> 14:47.151
>> Nah, not really, man.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.253
>> There's nothing more fun than

14:48.255 --> 14:49.254
winning.

14:49.256 --> 14:50.321
So, come on, drink up.

14:50.323 --> 14:51.322
>> All right.

14:51.324 --> 14:52.390
>> I'll have one with you. Yeah.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.558
>> Nice! All right!

14:53.560 --> 14:54.926
Let's do it, Boggs! Let's drink!

14:54.928 --> 14:57.161
>> All right. Cheers!

14:57.163 --> 15:00.765
>> Howdy, Dee.

15:00.767 --> 15:03.201
>> Well, what do you say, Boss?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.335
>> Now, I know you're not

15:04.337 --> 15:05.436
quitting on me.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.504
I need you to keep drinking

15:06.506 --> 15:07.572
those beers, so you can help me

15:07.574 --> 15:08.907
stop them Duke boys from

15:08.909 --> 15:10.875
spoiling all my crooked Hazzard

15:10.877 --> 15:13.044
County schemes!

15:13.046 --> 15:16.014
>> You got it, Boss Hoss.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.724
>> All right!

15:26.726 --> 15:27.926
Well, here we are-- beautiful

15:27.928 --> 15:29.193
North Dakota.

15:29.195 --> 15:30.461
Hope you brought a coat 'cause

15:30.463 --> 15:32.230
it looks cold as shit out there.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.965
>> I don't live in North Dakota.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.566
>> You're going to L.A.?

15:35.568 --> 15:37.201
>> About 200 miles inland-- the

15:37.203 --> 15:38.603
Salton Sea.

15:38.605 --> 15:39.871
My family has a tilapia farm

15:39.873 --> 15:41.272
there.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.974
>> Goddamn.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.910
Good. Good for them.

15:45.912 --> 15:47.812
Will you excuse me for a minute?

15:47.814 --> 15:49.080
>> Sure.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.249
(indistinct announcement)

15:51.251 --> 15:52.884
>> Dennis, Dennis?

15:52.886 --> 15:53.885
>> Huh?

15:53.887 --> 15:54.886
>> Where you going?

15:54.888 --> 15:56.321
>> Oh, uh, I mistook that girl

15:56.323 --> 15:57.588
for Great Plains trash.

15:57.590 --> 15:58.957
She's actually desert trash.

15:58.959 --> 15:59.958
I should've picked up on the

15:59.960 --> 16:01.426
multiple gecko tattoos, so

16:01.428 --> 16:02.760
this-this is kind of on me.

16:02.762 --> 16:03.995
Either way, I'd rather stay in

16:03.997 --> 16:05.463
this barren wasteland of a state

16:05.465 --> 16:06.631
than spend one more minute with

16:06.633 --> 16:07.765
that filth.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.133
I'll see you back in Philly.

16:09.135 --> 16:10.234
>> Wait, wait, Dennis.

16:10.236 --> 16:12.637
Don't go.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.379
Now you can go.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.418
>> Come on! Drink! Drink!

16:27.420 --> 16:28.419
You guys can do it!

16:28.421 --> 16:29.420
You guys are gonna make it!

16:29.422 --> 16:30.355
I can't believe what we are

16:30.357 --> 16:31.422
witnessing here.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.423
We are making history here,

16:32.425 --> 16:33.424
people!

16:33.426 --> 16:34.926
We're making history!

16:34.928 --> 16:36.127
>> Beer me, baby.

16:36.129 --> 16:37.161
>> You're 40 beers back, bitch!

16:37.163 --> 16:38.162
Just sit back and enjoy the

16:38.164 --> 16:39.263
show.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.531
>> Well, I'm tired of people

16:40.533 --> 16:41.833
telling me what I can't do.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.834
They say I can't drink on a

16:42.836 --> 16:44.635
plane.

16:44.637 --> 16:45.803
They say I can't bang on a

16:45.805 --> 16:46.838
plane.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.373
They'll say I can't be a pilot.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.308
I can't be a doctor.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.943
I'm gonna do it.

16:51.945 --> 16:52.977
I'm gonna do it right in front

16:52.979 --> 16:53.978
of your face.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.013
I'm gonna chug 15 beers right

16:55.015 --> 16:58.683
now.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.552
Oh, that's so cold.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.554
Beer's cold.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.190
(grunts)

17:06.192 --> 17:08.626
There's a...

17:12.165 --> 17:14.599
All right.

17:18.671 --> 17:20.905
Instant rebuff.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.976
Just leave me here.

17:24.978 --> 17:27.045
(electronic bell chimes)

17:32.052 --> 17:33.351
>> Okay, guys, here we go.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.552
Almost there! Almost there!

17:34.554 --> 17:35.920
Wake up! Perk up! Perk up!

17:35.922 --> 17:37.855
Guys, we're at 70 beers.

17:37.857 --> 17:38.890
That means one more to break the

17:38.892 --> 17:39.891
record.

17:39.893 --> 17:40.858
>> Come on.

17:40.860 --> 17:41.893
>> Come on, you can do it!

17:41.895 --> 17:43.094
Go! Chug it! Chug it!

17:43.096 --> 17:44.095
Come on, come on, you can do it.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.430
You can do it!

17:45.432 --> 17:47.265
I believe in you!

17:47.267 --> 17:48.332
>> Yeah!

17:48.334 --> 17:49.734
>> Yeah, Dee, go!

17:49.736 --> 17:51.202
>> I did it!

17:51.204 --> 17:53.104
>> 71 beers! Holy shit!

17:53.106 --> 17:54.205
>> I'm the king.

17:54.207 --> 17:55.606
I'm the king, Boss Hoss.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.008
>> But you're not done yet.

17:57.010 --> 17:58.176
(both groan)

17:58.178 --> 17:59.410
Yeah, no. Uh, Boggs didn't just

17:59.412 --> 18:00.611
drink enough beer to kill a

18:00.613 --> 18:01.612
horse.

18:01.614 --> 18:02.680
He also suited up the next day

18:02.682 --> 18:03.681
and went three for five, so

18:03.683 --> 18:04.615
you're gonna have to do that.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.616
>> I can do it, but just give me

18:05.618 --> 18:06.684
the bat. I got game.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.852
>> Yeah, totally.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.187
All right, uh... where's Dee?

18:09.189 --> 18:10.188
>> She took a ride on the

18:10.190 --> 18:11.389
carousel.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.825
>> What?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.067
>> Okay, here we go, Charlie.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.435
You got to go at least three for

18:24.437 --> 18:25.770
ten, all right?

18:25.772 --> 18:26.804
You ready?

18:26.806 --> 18:28.239
>> I got all numbers.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.240
>> Okay, I'm gonna put a little

18:29.242 --> 18:30.374
mustard on this one, all right?

18:30.376 --> 18:31.943
>> Give me the hot dog, baby!

18:31.945 --> 18:34.378
>> All right.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.477
>> Holy shit, dude!

19:06.479 --> 19:07.478
You roped that!

19:07.480 --> 19:08.579
>> It's Wade Boggs style!

19:08.581 --> 19:09.580
>> Wow!

19:09.582 --> 19:10.515
>> All right, give me another

19:10.517 --> 19:11.516
one.

19:11.518 --> 19:12.517
>> You know, that's the only

19:12.519 --> 19:13.584
ball I have, and I didn't expect

19:13.586 --> 19:14.919
you to hit it that far.

19:14.921 --> 19:15.953
I really don't feel like going

19:15.955 --> 19:17.288
to get it.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.123
So, I'm the commissioner.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.158
I say you did it!

19:20.160 --> 19:21.125
>> Game on!

19:21.127 --> 19:22.160
>> Yeah!

19:22.162 --> 19:23.161
Hey, one for one-- that's

19:23.163 --> 19:24.162
batting a thousand, dude.

19:24.164 --> 19:25.129
>> That's baseball, baby!

19:25.131 --> 19:26.130
>> Yeah!

19:26.132 --> 19:27.131
(whoops)

19:27.133 --> 19:28.132
Nice work!

19:28.134 --> 19:29.167
>> Yeah!

19:29.169 --> 19:30.168
Hey, man?

19:30.170 --> 19:31.202
