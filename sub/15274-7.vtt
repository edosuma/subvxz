WEBVTT

00:04.625 --> 00:07.425
HELLO, I'M HOME!

00:07.428 --> 00:10.798
JAY? SOMEBODY?

00:10.801 --> 00:12.721
HELLO! HAD A GREAT DAY
AT WORK,

00:12.723 --> 00:14.103
CONQUERED THE KNOWN WORLD.

00:16.637 --> 00:18.687
GREAT.

00:18.689 --> 00:20.639
NOBODY'S HOME.

00:20.641 --> 00:23.441
I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO BE
MY OWN FAMILY.

00:23.444 --> 00:24.574
HELLO, KADY.
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

00:24.565 --> 00:25.945
WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:25.946 --> 00:29.446
I WENT TO THE DENTIST
TO GET MY LIP FIXED.

00:29.450 --> 00:31.530
AND WHAT DID YOU DO
TODAY, CLAIRE?

00:31.532 --> 00:34.252
DADDY, I MET THIS
REALLY CUTE GUY AT SCHOOL,

00:34.245 --> 00:36.115
AND HE THINKS I'M CUTE
BUT I DON'T THINK HE'S CUTE

00:36.117 --> 00:37.787
BUT EVERYBODY ELSE
THINKS HE'S CUTE

00:37.788 --> 00:39.868
SO I THINK HE'S CUTE, TOO.
CAN I HAVE SOME MONEY?

00:39.870 --> 00:42.250
JUNIOR, WHAT DID YOU DO?

00:42.253 --> 00:45.723
DAD, WHATEVER IT IS,
I DIDN'T DO IT.

00:47.258 --> 00:50.048
DAD, AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I NEED TO EXCUSE MYSELF

00:50.050 --> 00:52.260
'CAUSE I'VE GOT SOME
UNFINISHED BUSINESS

00:52.263 --> 00:53.303
IN THE BATHROOM.

00:53.304 --> 00:56.144
AND HOW WAS YOUR DAY, JAY?

00:56.137 --> 00:58.637
MICHAEL, DON'T START
WITH ME, OKAY?

00:58.639 --> 01:00.679
I'VE HAD A HARD DAY AT WORK.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.613
HELLO, MISS LATELY.
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

01:04.605 --> 01:06.395
MICHAEL, DON'T START
WITH ME, OKAY?

01:06.397 --> 01:08.987
I HAD A HARD DAY AT WORK.
JUST DON'T START WITH ME.

01:08.989 --> 01:11.779
LOOK AT THE TIME.
WHERE IS EVERYBODY AT?

01:11.782 --> 01:14.072
THE KIDS ARE IN THEIR
AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS,

01:14.074 --> 01:16.374
ROSA'S PICKING UP KADY
FROM TUMBLE TOTS,

01:16.367 --> 01:17.827
AND I HAD A LATE MEETING.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.618
COME ON, BABY,
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL?

01:20.621 --> 01:22.121
WOULD YOU SMILE?

01:22.123 --> 01:24.763
I'LL SMILE WHEN I COME HOME
AND SEE MY WIFE AND KIDS

01:24.755 --> 01:27.585
AND SOME FOOD ON THE TABLE
LIKE MY FATHER USED TO HAVE.

01:27.588 --> 01:30.298
WELL, JUST COME HOME
A LITTLE LATER.

01:30.301 --> 01:33.051
HA HA HA.

01:33.053 --> 01:35.313
I'M SORRY. WHAT?

01:35.306 --> 01:37.306
JAY, I'M SERIOUS.
THIS IS NOT WORKING FOR ME.

01:37.308 --> 01:38.888
THIS IS NOT THE MARRIAGE
I SIGNED UP FOR.

01:38.889 --> 01:42.019
YOUR JOB IS NOT AS IMPORTANT
AS THE FAMILY.

01:42.022 --> 01:43.812
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

01:43.814 --> 01:45.234
NO, LISTEN,

01:45.226 --> 01:47.356
I UNDERSTAND YOUR NEED
TO BE FULFILLED

01:47.358 --> 01:49.148
AND ALL THAT OTHER NONSENSE,

01:49.150 --> 01:51.230
BUT YOUR JOB IS STARTING
TO INTERFERE

01:51.232 --> 01:53.492
WITH YOUR DUTIES
AS MOTHER AND WIFE.

01:53.494 --> 01:56.294
YOU KNOW WHAT, MICHAEL?
YOU ARE SUCH A MISOGYNIST.

01:56.287 --> 01:58.577
YEAH, I WOULD LOVE A MASSAGE
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

01:58.579 --> 02:01.039
AND I'M NOT GETTING
ENOUGH OF THOSE, EITHER.

02:01.041 --> 02:02.291
WHAT YOU TRYING TO SAY,

02:02.293 --> 02:03.793
I'M NOT DOING MY JOB
AROUND HERE?

02:03.794 --> 02:04.804
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:04.795 --> 02:06.165
IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.127
YOU'D HAVE TO BE SUPERWOMAN.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.088
I BEG YOUR PARDON,
I AM SUPERWOMAN.

02:10.090 --> 02:12.300
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

02:12.303 --> 02:15.523
NO, YOU'RE MORE
LIKE BATGIRL.

02:15.516 --> 02:20.806
YEAH YOU LOOK GOOD IN AN OUTFIT
BUT YOU DON"T HAVE NO
SUPERPOWERS.

02:20.811 --> 02:22.391
I'M NOT BATGIRL.

02:22.393 --> 02:24.403
ALL RIGHT,
THEN YOU'RE WONDER WOMAN,

02:24.395 --> 02:26.065
'CAUSE EVERY TIME
I COME HOME,

02:26.066 --> 02:27.936
I'M WONDERING,
"WHERE'S MY WOMAN?"

02:30.981 --> 02:34.661
JAY, LISTEN, BABY,
I DIDN'T MARRY SUPERWOMAN.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.615
I MARRIED JAY MARIE JOHNSON.

02:36.617 --> 02:39.657
OKAY? YOU ADDED
ALL THIS OTHER STUFF.

02:39.660 --> 02:41.330
AND I CAN DO
ALL THAT OTHER STUFF

02:41.332 --> 02:42.492
AND STILL TAKE CARE OF YOU

02:42.493 --> 02:44.083
AND EVERYTHING ELSE
MY FAMILY NEEDS,

02:44.084 --> 02:45.924
AND I'M GONNA
PROVE IT TO YOU.
HOW?

02:45.916 --> 02:49.336
IN THE NEXT TWO HOURS,
I AM GOING

02:49.340 --> 02:51.380
TO TAKE A SHOWER,
CHANGE MY CLOTHES,

02:51.382 --> 02:53.632
COOK DINNER,
CHECK EVERYBODY'S HOMEWORK,

02:53.634 --> 02:56.264
WASH FOUR LOADS OF LAUNDRY
AND TWO LOADS OF DISHES.

02:56.257 --> 02:58.797
AND WHAT ABOUT
TAKING CARE OF ME?

02:58.799 --> 03:01.759
OH, BABY, SINCE YOU THINK
THAT I DON'T HAVE TIME

03:01.762 --> 03:06.982
FOR EVERYTHING, YOU CAN
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

03:06.977 --> 03:11.227
I'M GOING TO BE WATCHING YOU
TAKE THAT SHOWER.

03:21.822 --> 03:23.822
HEY, KIDS,
HOW Y'ALL DOING?

03:23.824 --> 03:25.004
HEY, DADDY.
HEY, DAD.

03:24.995 --> 03:26.035
HEY, GUYS.

03:26.036 --> 03:27.496
LOOK AT THIS --
MOM'S COOKING

03:27.498 --> 03:28.828
A NICE MEAL
FOR THE FAMILY.

03:28.829 --> 03:29.829
WE'RE GOING TO SIT DOWN
AND ENJOY IT,

03:29.830 --> 03:31.170
SOME TIME TOGETHER.

03:31.171 --> 03:33.001
I'M GOING TO MY ROOM.
NO, NO, NO, SIT DOWN.

03:33.003 --> 03:34.433
YOUR MOM'S GOING
OUT OF HER WAY.

03:34.425 --> 03:35.925
YOU'RE GOING TO EAT
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

03:35.926 --> 03:37.136
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

03:37.137 --> 03:38.467
AND I'M NOT GOING
TO SCHOOL TOMORROW.

03:38.469 --> 03:41.259
HEY, HEY. SIT DOWN.
WHAT'S WRONG?

03:41.262 --> 03:42.722
IT'S THIS NEW KID AT SCHOOL.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.693
HE'S BEEN RAGGING ON JUNIOR
FOR WEEKS.

03:44.685 --> 03:45.935
RAGGING ON YOU HOW?

03:45.936 --> 03:47.186
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

03:47.187 --> 03:48.727
WHAT, IS HE PUSHING YOU
AROUND?

03:48.729 --> 03:49.809
YEAH, HE IS, DADDY.

03:49.810 --> 03:52.190
HE TAKES JUNIOR'S HAT OFF,
HE WON'T GIVE IT BACK,

03:52.192 --> 03:53.352
AND HE MAKES FUN OF HIM.

03:53.354 --> 03:54.784
WHAT DOES HE SAY?

03:54.775 --> 03:56.985
HE SAID I WAS SO UGLY
WHEN I WAS BORN

03:56.987 --> 03:59.277
THAT THE DOCTOR ALMOST
CIRCUMCISED MY NOSE.

04:01.952 --> 04:03.992
AND EVERYONE
WAS LAUGHING AT ME.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.874
I WANTED TO PUNCH HIM.
WHY DIDN'T YOU?

04:05.866 --> 04:08.126
BECAUSE HE'S HUGE
AND HE'D KILL ME.

04:08.128 --> 04:09.828
AND THAT'S NOT THE WAY
TO HANDLE IT, JUNIOR.

04:09.830 --> 04:11.670
YOU'VE GOT TO FIGHT BACK
WITH YOUR MOUTH.

04:11.672 --> 04:13.502
YEAH, BITE HIM.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.304
NO, THAT IS NOT
WHAT I MEAN.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.426
YOU GOT TO FIGHT BACK
WITH WORDS.

04:17.428 --> 04:19.757
I TRIED.
REALLY?
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

04:19.760 --> 04:23.340
I SAID HIS HEAD WAS SO BIG,
HE MUST NEED A REALLY BIG HAT.

04:26.887 --> 04:29.187
THAT'S IT?

04:29.189 --> 04:30.939
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

04:30.941 --> 04:32.691
HE'S GOT YOUR
SENSE OF HUMOR, BABY.

04:32.693 --> 04:34.233
HEY.

04:34.234 --> 04:36.404
WHAT'S UP, DADDY?

04:36.397 --> 04:38.527
HEY, FOR SHEEZY WAHEEZY

04:38.529 --> 04:41.279
OFF THE HEEZY
CHUCKY CHEESY.

04:42.703 --> 04:44.243
SIT DOWN
AND JOIN THE FAMILY.

04:44.244 --> 04:45.624
MOVE IT, JUNIOR.

04:45.616 --> 04:48.956
OKAY, I MADE EVERYBODY'S
INDIVIDUAL FAVORITE --

04:48.959 --> 04:50.959
CURRY CHICKEN FOR DADDY,

04:50.961 --> 04:52.411
GRILLED VEGETABLES
FOR CLAIRE,

04:52.413 --> 04:53.963
HAMBURGER FOR JUNIOR,

04:53.964 --> 04:55.974
AND MACARONI AND CHEESE
AND BROCCOLI FOR THE BABY.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.046
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.047
NOT FOR SUPERWOMAN.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.339
MIGHTY MOUSE. UM...

05:01.922 --> 05:03.972
BABY, SIT DOWN.
WE'RE GOING TO HELP JUNIOR

05:03.974 --> 05:05.814
LEARN HOW TO PLAY
THE DOZENS.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.266
OH, I USED TO BE GOOD
AT THAT.

05:07.267 --> 05:08.977
WHY DON'T YOU SAY SOMETHING
LIKE, UM,

05:08.979 --> 05:10.099
"YOUR MAMA'S SO FAT,

05:10.100 --> 05:11.930
SHE BROKE HER LEG
AND GRAVY POURED OUT"?

05:14.735 --> 05:16.985
HOW ABOUT,
"YOUR DADDY'S SO OLD,

05:16.987 --> 05:19.937
HE KNEW BURGER KING
WHEN HE WAS JUST A PRINCE"?

05:21.942 --> 05:25.082
YOUR FEET ARE SO STINKY,
YOUR SHOES RAN AWAY.

05:26.787 --> 05:28.997
SEE, THIS RUNS
IN YOUR GENES, SON.

05:28.999 --> 05:30.999
THERE'S NO WAY
THIS GUY CAN BEAT YOU.

05:31.001 --> 05:32.871
HERE, TRY THIS ONE --
YOUR MAMA'S SO FAT,

05:32.873 --> 05:34.923
SHE COMES FROM BOTH SIDES
OF THE FAMILY.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.130
WHO IS THIS KID?

05:41.131 --> 05:42.551
HIS NAME IS GEORGE BLAKE.

05:42.553 --> 05:44.933
HIS FAMILY MOVED INTO
THE DUNNIGANS' OLD HOUSE.

05:44.925 --> 05:47.175
WHY DON'T WE
INVITE THE BLAKES OVER, RIGHT?

05:47.177 --> 05:49.967
WE'LL WINE AND DINE THEM,
THEN WE'LL PICK THEIR BRAINS

05:49.970 --> 05:52.060
AND FIND OUT THEIR KID'S
WEAKNESSES ARE,

05:52.062 --> 05:53.932
AND THEN YOU CAN USE
THAT STUFF AGAINST HIM.

05:53.934 --> 05:54.944
YOU PUSH THE BUTTONS.

05:54.935 --> 05:56.065
SEE, THAT'S HOW
HE GOT TO YOU,

05:56.066 --> 05:58.026
'CAUSE YOU'RE AFRAID THAT
SOME OF THAT STUFF

05:58.028 --> 05:59.438
ABOUT YOU BEING AN UGLY BABY
IS TRUE.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.980
AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

06:01.982 --> 06:03.192
YOU WERE A BEAUTIFUL BABY.

06:03.193 --> 06:04.033
THANKS, MOM.

06:04.034 --> 06:07.754
THEY DID TAKE A COUPLE INCHES
OFF YOUR NOSE THOUGH.

06:13.994 --> 06:17.094
OH, JANET, THAT KEY LIME PIE
WAS INCREDIBLE.

06:17.087 --> 06:18.087
THANK YOU.

06:18.088 --> 06:19.958
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A PIECE
FOR YOUR SON?

06:19.960 --> 06:21.300
OH, HE'S ON A DIET.

06:21.301 --> 06:23.961
HE HAD A LITTLE BIT
OF A WEIGHT PROBLEM,

06:23.964 --> 06:26.224
SO WE SENT HIM
TO ONE OF THOSE CAMPS.

06:26.216 --> 06:29.426
OH, YEAH, REALLY?

06:29.430 --> 06:30.970
SUGAR WOODS.

06:30.971 --> 06:32.721
SUGAR WOODS.

06:32.723 --> 06:34.353
IT'S FOR THE EXTRA HUSKY BOY.

06:34.354 --> 06:37.024
PERSONALLY, I THINK
IT'S A BUNCH OF CRAP.

06:37.017 --> 06:38.977
IF HE HADN'T LOST
THOSE 60 POUNDS,

06:38.979 --> 06:41.729
HE'D HAVE A SHOT
AT A FOOTBALL SCHOLARSHIP.

06:41.732 --> 06:44.952
OF COURSE, HE COULDN'T FIT
HIS HEAD INSIDE THE HELMET.

06:47.488 --> 06:49.948
HE MUST HAVE
A REALLY BIG HEAD.

06:49.950 --> 06:52.530
WEARS A SIZE 14 HAT.

06:52.533 --> 06:53.873
[ WHISTLES ]

06:53.874 --> 06:55.504
HOW DO YOU FIND
A HAT THAT BIG?

06:55.496 --> 06:57.876
WHAT, DO YOU SEW
TWO 7s TOGETHER?

06:57.878 --> 07:01.088
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

07:01.091 --> 07:02.541
I USED TO DO
A LOT OF SEWING,

07:02.543 --> 07:04.723
AND GEORGIE WAS MY LITTLE
DRESSMAKER DUMMY.

07:04.715 --> 07:06.675
DRESSMAKER DUMMY.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.637
I USED TO PIN THE FABRIC
FOR THE DRESSES AROUND HIM,

07:09.640 --> 07:11.220
AND HE WOULD GIGGLE
AND GIGGLE.

07:11.221 --> 07:12.511
IT WAS SO CUTE.

07:12.513 --> 07:14.613
OH, THAT IS SO CUTE.
ISN'T THAT CUTE, MICHAEL?

07:14.605 --> 07:18.055
IT'S ADORABLE.

07:18.058 --> 07:19.768
SWEETIE, WE'D BETTER
HEAD ON HOME.

07:19.770 --> 07:21.020
YOU KNOW HOW GEORGIE-POO

07:21.021 --> 07:22.861
HATES BEING IN THE HOUSE
BY HIMSELF.

07:22.863 --> 07:25.163
I KNOW HOW HE HATES
BEING CALLED GEORGIE-POO.

07:25.155 --> 07:27.365
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

07:27.367 --> 07:30.777
NO, THIS HAS BEEN GREAT,
VERY INFORMATIVE.

07:30.781 --> 07:33.371
NICE TO GET TO KNOW
THE NEIGHBORS.

07:33.373 --> 07:34.843
THANKS VERY MUCH.

07:34.835 --> 07:36.205
TELL GEORGIE-POO

07:36.206 --> 07:38.286
WE SAID HI.

07:38.288 --> 07:40.458
OKAY, BYE.

07:40.460 --> 07:43.710
KADY. KADY! STOP THAT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:43.714 --> 07:46.644
EW.

07:46.637 --> 07:48.217
WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT?

07:48.218 --> 07:49.468
OH, SHE'S SEAT-SNIFFING.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.969
WHAT?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.351
YOU KNOW, YOU SNIFF
THE CUSHIONS

07:52.352 --> 07:53.552
WHEN SOMEBODY LEAVES,

07:53.554 --> 07:55.024
KIND OF GET THE FLAVOR
OF WHO THEY ARE.

07:57.057 --> 07:58.307
YOU NEVER DID THAT?

07:58.308 --> 08:01.018
DID THAT? I NEVER EVEN
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

08:01.021 --> 08:03.101
WELL, ALL MY FAMILY
DID IT --

08:03.103 --> 08:05.033
MY BROTHERS, ME,
I DID IT.

08:05.025 --> 08:07.025
IT WAS A LITTLE GAME
WE PLAYED.

08:07.027 --> 08:09.107
THAT'S NOT A GAME,
THAT'S WEIRD.

08:09.109 --> 08:11.029
AND EVERYBODY
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

08:11.031 --> 08:12.241
NEVER DID THAT.

08:12.242 --> 08:14.752
OH, SURE. YOU PROBABLY
JUST DIDN'T NOTICE.

08:14.745 --> 08:17.495
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK YOU'RE A SNIFFEE.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.207
OKAY, LET ME ASK YOU THIS.

08:19.209 --> 08:21.579
WHEN WE SIT DOWN
ON THIS SOFA, THESE KIDS

08:21.582 --> 08:23.382
COME DOWN HERE AND --
NO, NO, NO.

08:23.383 --> 08:25.513
WE'RE FAMILY.
THAT WOULD BE DISGUSTING.

08:25.505 --> 08:28.005
IT'S ONLY PEOPLE OUTSIDE
THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY.

08:28.008 --> 08:32.178
YOU TRYING TO TELL ME THERE
ARE SEAT SNIFFING RULES?

08:32.182 --> 08:34.011
WELL, THERE'S ONLY
ONE MAJOR ONE,

08:34.014 --> 08:35.943
WHICH IS YOU GOT TO
GET TO THE SEAT

08:35.936 --> 08:36.936
WITHIN 15 SECONDS.

08:36.937 --> 08:38.636
OTHERWISE THE SMELL
EVAPORATES.

08:40.601 --> 08:43.640
UNLESS YOU GOT
THE PLASTIC SLIPCOVERS.

08:43.644 --> 08:45.244
OH, MICHAEL!

08:45.235 --> 08:49.105
THAT'S GROSS, MICHAEL.
THAT'S NASTY.

08:49.109 --> 08:50.569
NO, IT'S CUTE.
YOU SEE THE LITTLE FACE?

08:50.571 --> 08:53.071
THAT'S NOT CUTE.
THAT'S NOT CUTE.

08:53.073 --> 08:55.043
RELAX, BABY.
IT'S JUST A PHASE.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.705
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S A PHASE.

08:56.707 --> 08:58.867
IT'S GOT TO STOP.
THAT IS JUST NASTY.

08:58.869 --> 09:00.829
EW.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.251
MICHAEL!

09:10.090 --> 09:11.260
KADY.

09:11.261 --> 09:12.841
YEAH, MOMMY?

09:12.843 --> 09:16.983
BABY, WHERE DID YOU LEARN
ALL THIS SEAT-SNIFFING STUFF?

09:16.977 --> 09:18.227
IT'S JUST FUN.

09:18.228 --> 09:20.888
WELL, MOMMY DOESN'T THINK
IT'S VERY GOOD.

09:20.891 --> 09:23.311
WAIT A MINUTE.
LET ME SEE YOUR MOUTH.

09:24.524 --> 09:26.404
BABY!

09:26.396 --> 09:28.446
WHEN DID YOUR TEETH
FALL OUT?

09:28.448 --> 09:29.948
YESTERDAY.

09:29.950 --> 09:31.030
YESTERDAY?

09:31.031 --> 09:33.991
WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL MOMMY?

09:33.994 --> 09:36.254
BECAUSE YOU WERE AT WORK.

09:36.246 --> 09:40.196
OH, SWEETIE, I'M SORRY.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.870
I'M SORRY I MISSED IT.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.542
BUT DON'T WORRY, OKAY?

09:43.543 --> 09:45.343
WE'RE GOING TO CALL
THE TOOTH FAIRY.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.795
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

09:46.797 --> 09:50.207
LAST NIGHT I GOT $5
FROM THE TOOTH BROTHER.

09:56.176 --> 09:57.346
THAT WAS SOME ANSWER
YOU GAVE

09:57.347 --> 09:59.177
IN MATH CLASS, JUNIOR.
YOU'RE SO DUMB,

09:59.179 --> 10:00.519
WHEN THEY TOLD YOU
2 PLUS 2 IS 4,

10:00.520 --> 10:02.350
YOU PROBABLY ASKED,
"FOR WHAT?"

10:02.352 --> 10:04.392
OH, YEAH?
WELL, YOU'RE SO DUMB,

10:04.394 --> 10:06.154
YOU CAN'T EVEN SPELL "I.Q."

10:06.146 --> 10:07.856
HA HA HA.

10:07.858 --> 10:10.318
YOU'RE SO IGNORANT,
YOU THINK MILK OF MAGNESIA

10:10.320 --> 10:11.360
COMES FROM CHINESE COWS.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.531
AND WHEN YOU WERE BORN,
YOU WERE SO UGLY,

10:13.533 --> 10:15.333
THE DOCTOR
SLAPPED YOUR MAMA.

10:15.325 --> 10:17.155
WELL, I MAY BE UGLY,
BUT AT LEAST I'M NOT

10:17.157 --> 10:18.447
SOME OLD HUSKY BOY

10:18.448 --> 10:20.618
WHOSE MAMA PUT DRESSES ON HIM
LIKE A LITTLE GIRL,

10:20.620 --> 10:23.950
AN UGLY LITTLE GIRL
WITH A BIG HEAD

10:23.954 --> 10:25.174
WHO CRIES LIKE A BABY

10:25.165 --> 10:27.245
ANY TIME HE'S LEFT ALONE
IN HIS OWN HOUSE.

10:27.247 --> 10:29.667
ISN'T THAT RIGHT,
YOU SUGAR WOODS FAT BOY

10:29.670 --> 10:31.300
CAMP DROPOUT?

10:31.301 --> 10:33.511
GEORGIE-POO.

10:33.513 --> 10:36.023
YEAH.

10:37.217 --> 10:39.057
HEY, DON'T TOUCH MY BROTHER!

10:39.059 --> 10:41.309
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT IT, STRING BEAN?

10:41.311 --> 10:42.181
OHH!

10:43.393 --> 10:45.193
YOU BROKE MY NOSE.

10:47.027 --> 10:49.267
YOU'RE DEAD MEAT, KYLE.

11:09.249 --> 11:11.879
HOW YOU DOING, CHAMP?

11:13.003 --> 11:14.803
HOW YOU THINK I'M DOING?

11:14.795 --> 11:16.675
YOU SHOULD BE DOING GREAT.
YOU WON.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.386
I DIDN'T WIN.
CLAIRE WON.

11:18.388 --> 11:20.508
NOW THIS GUY'S
GOING TO KILL ME.

11:20.510 --> 11:22.010
I CAN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

11:22.012 --> 11:24.222
NO, YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

11:24.224 --> 11:26.524
DAD, HE SAID
IF I GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

11:26.516 --> 11:27.516
I'M DEAD MEAT.

11:27.517 --> 11:29.857
JUNIOR, YOU CAN NEVER
LET A MAN

11:29.860 --> 11:31.730
PUT THAT KIND OF FEAR IN YOU.

11:31.732 --> 11:33.572
HAVE YOU SEEN
HOW BIG HE IS?

11:33.573 --> 11:35.703
HE'S NOT JUSTAMAN,
HE'S A CROWD.

11:38.028 --> 11:39.278
LOOK, SON,

11:39.279 --> 11:41.029
IF YOU DON'T STAND UP
FOR YOURSELF NOW,

11:41.031 --> 11:42.821
YOU'LL BE BACKING DOWN
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

11:42.823 --> 11:44.663
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

11:44.664 --> 11:45.964
YEAH, WELL, I CAN'T.

11:45.956 --> 11:48.206
NOW, YOU HAVE TO
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.288
I'M NOT SAYING
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT HIM.

11:50.290 --> 11:52.540
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO
PLAY THE DOZENS.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.252
BUT YOU GOT TO
LOOK HIM IN THE EYE.

11:54.254 --> 11:55.974
EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO
WALK AWAY,

11:55.966 --> 11:57.176
YOU LOOK HIM IN THE EYE.

11:57.177 --> 11:59.177
YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THAT, DAD,

11:59.179 --> 12:01.049
THAT I COULD JUST
WALK AWAY?

12:01.051 --> 12:04.341
YEAH. IF HE'S AS BIG
AS YOU SAY HE IS, WALK FAST.

12:06.056 --> 12:07.476
AND WALK UP A HILL

12:07.477 --> 12:10.437
AND DROP SOME TWINKIES
EVERY 2 OR 3 YARDS.

12:14.114 --> 12:15.454
WHAT'S UP, MOMMY?

12:15.445 --> 12:16.485
COME HERE.

12:16.486 --> 12:19.116
BABY, I JUST WANT
TO HUG YOU.

12:19.119 --> 12:20.909
COME HERE. OOH!

12:20.911 --> 12:23.911
HAVE I TOLD YOU HOW MUCH
I LOVE YOU LATELY?

12:23.914 --> 12:26.544
MOM, HAVE YOU BEEN
WATCHING "OPRAH" AGAIN?

12:26.536 --> 12:30.286
NO, AND I HAVEN'T BEEN
WATCHING MY FAMILY, EITHER.

12:30.290 --> 12:33.420
CLAIRE, BABY,
WHY DID YOU HIT THAT BOY?

12:33.423 --> 12:36.013
IT WAS INSTINCT, MOM.
THAT KID HIT JUNIOR,

12:36.006 --> 12:38.256
AND THE NEXT THING I KNEW,
I PUNCHED HIM.

12:38.258 --> 12:41.258
CLAIRE, I DON'T WANT
MY DAUGHTER OUT THERE FIGHTING.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.261
I MEAN, LOOK AT THIS FACE.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.273
I DON'T WANT ANYTHING
TO HAPPEN TO THIS FACE.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.646
THEN LET GO OF IT.

12:47.647 --> 12:49.597
SORRY.

12:49.599 --> 12:50.769
LOOK, BABY,

12:50.770 --> 12:54.190
LISTEN TO ME
REALLY, REALLY CAREFULLY.

12:54.194 --> 12:57.744
MEN PRIDE THEMSELVES
ON BEING WARRIORS,

12:57.737 --> 13:00.197
AND IF YOU MAKE A MAN FEEL
LIKE HE'S NOT A WARRIOR,

13:00.200 --> 13:01.740
THEN HE DOESN'T FEEL
LIKE A MAN.

13:01.741 --> 13:05.911
MOM, I AM NOT APOLOGIZING
TO THAT FAT TUB OF LARD.

13:05.906 --> 13:08.246
I'M TALKING
ABOUT YOUR BROTHER.

13:08.248 --> 13:09.248
OH.

13:09.249 --> 13:12.119
SEE, MEN SEE THEMSELVES
AS PROVIDERS

13:12.122 --> 13:15.012
AND PROTECTORS,
AND IT'S OUR JOB

13:15.005 --> 13:18.125
TO LET THEM BELIEVE
THAT IT'S TRUE. OKAY?

13:18.128 --> 13:20.128
THINK ABOUT IT.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.680
COME IN.

13:25.385 --> 13:27.975
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO JUMP
IN FRONT OF ME LIKE THAT.

13:27.978 --> 13:29.688
I CAN FIGHT
MY OWN BATTLES.

13:29.689 --> 13:32.639
I KNOW THAT.
I JUST FIGURED

13:32.642 --> 13:34.392
IF YOU STARTED
BEATING ON HIM,

13:34.394 --> 13:36.204
YOU WOULD HAVE HURT HIM
REALLY BADLY

13:36.196 --> 13:38.356
AND GOTTEN YOURSELF
INTO A LOT OF TROUBLE.

13:38.358 --> 13:40.068
YOU REALLY THINK SO?

13:40.070 --> 13:41.200
YEAH.

13:41.201 --> 13:42.361
I MIGHT HAVE,
YOU KNOW?

13:42.362 --> 13:43.822
OH, I KNOW.

13:43.823 --> 13:44.823
YEAH.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.834
HA HA.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.405
WHO ARE WE KIDDING?

13:48.408 --> 13:52.448
THAT GUY WOULD HAVE
KILLED ME.

13:52.452 --> 13:53.872
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

13:53.874 --> 13:56.094
THE POINT IS
YOU STOOD UP TO HIM,

13:56.086 --> 13:57.336
PLAYING THE DOZENS.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.167
I MEAN, HIM PICKING ON YOU,
SEE, THAT WAS EASY.

14:01.171 --> 14:04.461
YOU STANDING UP TO HIM,
THAT WAS HARD.

14:04.464 --> 14:05.934
WELL, ANYWAY, I GOT HOMEWORK.

14:05.926 --> 14:07.886
YEAH, ME TOO.

14:07.888 --> 14:09.638
HEY, CLAIRE.
YEAH?

14:09.639 --> 14:10.929
THANKS.

14:10.931 --> 14:12.391
SURE THING.

14:19.029 --> 14:23.279
YOU SURE GOT A PRETTY SMILE
BACK THERE.

14:23.283 --> 14:25.123
SHH.
DON'T BOTHER ME.

14:25.115 --> 14:26.865
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

14:26.866 --> 14:27.986
SHH. MICHAEL.

14:27.988 --> 14:31.368
THAT'S IT.
HEY, MOM, WE'RE DONE.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.121
WE'RE GOING UPSTAIRS.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.123
OKAY.

14:34.124 --> 14:36.714
GOODBYE, CLAIRE,

14:36.706 --> 14:38.126
HELLO, KADY.

14:38.128 --> 14:42.048
YEAH, WATCH THIS, BABY.
WATCH THIS.

14:42.052 --> 14:44.092
[ SNIFFS ]

14:44.094 --> 14:46.064
[ SNEEZES ]

14:49.059 --> 14:50.059
WHAT DID YOU DO?

14:50.060 --> 14:52.140
I PUT PEPPER
ON ALL THE CUSHIONS.

14:52.142 --> 14:56.022
DON'T WEAR WHITE
FOR A WHILE.

14:56.016 --> 14:58.016
JOB WELL DONE.

14:58.018 --> 15:00.278
SEE? I'M TAKING CARE
OF BUSINESS NOW.

15:00.280 --> 15:01.940
I MISSED KADY'S FIRST TOOTH,

15:01.942 --> 15:03.612
I WASN'T THERE FOR CLAIRE

15:03.613 --> 15:06.533
WHEN SHE TURNED INTO
SMOKIN' JOSEPHINE FRAZIER,

15:06.526 --> 15:07.986
BUT NOW I'M ON TOP OF IT.

15:07.988 --> 15:10.988
HMM. I'M PROUD OF CLAIRE,
STICKING UP FOR HER BROTHER.

15:10.991 --> 15:13.331
IT'S COOL THE WAY SHE
POPPED THAT DUDE -- POP.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.533
NO, THAT IS NOT COOL.

15:14.534 --> 15:15.754
WE WILL NOT RAISE OUR CHILDREN

15:15.745 --> 15:17.335
TO SETTLE THEIR CONFLICTS
WITH VIOLENCE.

15:17.337 --> 15:18.997
THEY HAVE TO LEARN
HOW TO COMPROMISE.

15:18.999 --> 15:20.749
WELL, IT'S HARD TO COMPROMISE

15:20.750 --> 15:23.000
WHEN SOMEBODY KNOCKS YOU
ON YOUR ASS.

15:23.003 --> 15:25.603
MICHAEL, IT'S NOT THE SAME
AS WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

15:25.595 --> 15:27.675
THEY SHOOT NOWADAYS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:27.677 --> 15:29.347
CLAIRE DIDN'T HAVE TO
GO THAT FAR.

15:29.349 --> 15:30.719
SHE ATTACKED THAT BOY.

15:30.720 --> 15:33.050
HEY, YOU HIT ONE OF US,
YOU HIT ALL OF US,

15:33.053 --> 15:34.933
AND THE WRATH
OF THE ENTIRE FAMILY

15:34.934 --> 15:36.694
WILL BE VISITED
UPON YOUR HEAD

15:36.686 --> 15:38.356
AND THE HEADS
OF YOUR CHILDREN

15:38.358 --> 15:40.148
AND YOUR CHILDREN'S
CHILDREN

15:40.150 --> 15:41.150
UNTIL THE END OF TIME.

15:41.151 --> 15:43.611
THANK YOU, OBI-WAN KE-BALDY.

15:43.613 --> 15:46.533
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:46.526 --> 15:48.566
I HOPE YOU HAVE SOMETHING
BETTER THAN THAT TO SAY,

15:48.568 --> 15:50.488
'CAUSE GEORGE'S FATHER
IS COMING OVER HERE LATER

15:50.490 --> 15:51.620
TO TALK ABOUT THE INCIDENT.

15:51.621 --> 15:53.951
WHEN DID IT GET UPGRADED
TO AN INCIDENT?

15:53.953 --> 15:56.343
I THINK IT WAS WHEN
THE WRATH OF CLAIRE'S FIST

15:56.336 --> 15:58.126
WAS VISITED UPON
GEORGE'S NOSE.

15:58.128 --> 16:01.128
START THINKING HOW YOU'RE
GOING TO DEAL WITH THIS MAN.

16:10.680 --> 16:13.180
HAVE A SEAT, SON.

16:24.604 --> 16:29.454
THIS WAS AN UNFORTUNATE
INCIDENT.

16:29.449 --> 16:31.569
WELL, I HARDLY THINK
IT'S AN INCIDENT.

16:31.571 --> 16:33.321
I MEAN, IT'S JUST,
OUR KIDS GOT

16:33.323 --> 16:35.173
A LITTLE OUT OF HAND,
THAT'S ALL.

16:35.165 --> 16:36.875
BUT YOUR DAUGHTER
HIT MY KID.

16:36.876 --> 16:38.246
SHE DAMN NEAR
BROKE HIS NOSE.

16:38.248 --> 16:40.998
WELL, THAT WAS AFTER YOUR SON
HIT MY SON.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.620
LOOK, MIKEY,
I KNOW KIDS

16:42.622 --> 16:44.502
ARE GOING TO BE KIDS,
ALL RIGHT?

16:44.504 --> 16:46.934
BUT IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT GEORGE WAS PROVOKED.

16:46.926 --> 16:50.086
LOOK, JOEY, IT'S OBVIOUS
THAT YOUR SON

16:50.090 --> 16:54.050
IS 10 TIMES THE SIZE
OF MY SON.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.694
I MEAN, LOOK AT THESE ARMS.
THESE ARE LITTLE TOOTHPICKS.

16:55.685 --> 16:57.265
HE CAN'T POSE A THREAT.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.637
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S JUST HOPE

16:58.638 --> 17:00.558
THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN,
ALL RIGHT?

17:00.560 --> 17:01.810
COME ON, LET'S GO, SON.

17:12.612 --> 17:15.752
YEAH, LET'S JUST HOPE
IT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

17:15.744 --> 17:17.744
'CAUSE IF IT DOES...

17:17.747 --> 17:21.707
IF IT DOES, WHAT?

17:21.711 --> 17:23.830
IF IT DOES,
I MIGHT HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

17:25.835 --> 17:31.375
AND JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY...

17:31.381 --> 17:34.801
WHAT MIGHT THIS SOMETHING BE?

17:34.804 --> 17:35.894
DAD!

17:35.885 --> 17:37.595
NO, NO.
I JUST WANT TO HEAR

17:37.597 --> 17:39.727
THE PARAMETERS
THAT I'M WORKING IN.

17:39.729 --> 17:41.269
I JUST WOULDN'T WANT
TO HAVE TO

17:41.271 --> 17:43.101
TAKE THE SITUATION
INTO MY OWN HANDS.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.613
IS THAT RIGHT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

17:45.605 --> 17:47.855
IF YOU TAKE THE SITUATION
INTO YOUR HANDS,

17:47.857 --> 17:49.777
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO
PUT DOWN

17:49.779 --> 17:51.689
THE SANDWICHES
AND THE MEATLOAF.

17:51.691 --> 17:54.151
SO, WHAT, NOW YOU'RE
CALLING ME FAT?

17:54.154 --> 17:57.704
NO, I DIDN'T CALL YOU FAT.
THE SCALE CALLS YOU FAT.

17:57.697 --> 18:00.327
THE RICHTER SCALE
CALLS YOU FAT.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.040
I CALL YOU CHUBSY-WUBSY.

18:02.041 --> 18:04.121
I'D RATHER BE FAT THAN BALD.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.554
OH, YEAH?

18:05.545 --> 18:07.705
YEAH, YOU LOOK
LIKE A CORN DOG WITH EYEBROWS.

18:09.759 --> 18:12.709
SO WHEN IS THE BABY DUE?

18:12.712 --> 18:14.262
WHENEVER IT'S DUE,

18:14.264 --> 18:15.774
IT'S GONNA HAVE MORE HAIR
THAN YOU, BALDY.

18:15.765 --> 18:18.715
IS THAT ALL YOU GOT
IS THE BALD STUFF?

18:18.718 --> 18:22.058
LOOK, I CAN GROW HAIR...
WELL, AROUND HERE.

18:22.061 --> 18:25.281
BUT YOU'RE UGLY.
YOU CAN'T GROW HANDSOME.

18:25.275 --> 18:26.525
DAD!

18:26.526 --> 18:29.026
THAT'S IT.
COME ON, LET'S GO.

18:29.028 --> 18:31.688
WHAT, DO THEY HAVE
A BUFFET OUTSIDE?

18:31.691 --> 18:32.691
DAD! DAD!

18:32.692 --> 18:35.952
REMEMBER, WALK AWAY.

18:40.290 --> 18:41.790
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY.

18:41.791 --> 18:43.541
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

18:43.543 --> 18:44.623
SHAKE.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.844
IT WAS CHILDISH.

18:45.835 --> 18:48.205
COME ON, DAD,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

18:48.208 --> 18:50.298
I'LL GO BUY YOU
SOME ICE CREAM.

18:50.300 --> 18:51.710
NONFAT.

18:55.305 --> 18:57.095
I'M SORRY, SON.
I APOLOGIZE.

18:57.096 --> 18:59.346
THAT WAS --
THAT WAS VERY CHILDISH.

18:59.349 --> 19:01.639
THAT'S OKAY.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.891
SOMETIMES IT'S HARD
TO WALK AWAY.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.483
YOU WERE FUNNY, THOUGH.

19:05.475 --> 19:08.435
YOU THINK SO?
WHICH ONE DID YOU LIKE?

19:08.438 --> 19:10.398
WHEN'S THE BABY DUE?

19:10.400 --> 19:12.690
THAT WAS A KILLER, DAD.

19:12.692 --> 19:14.402
COME ON, LET ME
BUY YOU SOME ICE CREAM.

19:14.404 --> 19:15.994
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GET YOU SOME ROGAINE.

19:22.912 --> 19:25.422
YOU MEAN YOU ALMOST
CAME TO BLOWS?

19:25.415 --> 19:27.625
THAT'S RIGHT.
HE'S LUCKY, TOO,

19:27.627 --> 19:29.957
'CAUSE I WAS GOING
TO HIT HIM LIKE THIS,

19:29.959 --> 19:31.789
THEN I HIT HIM OVER THERE,
THEN I HIT HIM UP THERE,

19:31.791 --> 19:33.211
THEN I HIT HIM LIKE THIS,

19:33.213 --> 19:34.673
THEN I HIT OVER THERE
AND I HIT HIM RIGHT THERE.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.564
OH, GOD!

19:36.556 --> 19:38.256
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

19:38.258 --> 19:39.468
I DON'T KNOW.

19:39.469 --> 19:41.889
BABY, YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN US,

19:41.891 --> 19:44.931
TWO GROWN MEN
ACTING LIKE 9-YEAR-OLDS.

19:44.934 --> 19:45.944
YEAH.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.725
I WOULD HAVE
BEAT HIM, THOUGH.

19:47.727 --> 19:50.567
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY
SCORED POINTS WITH YOUR SON.

19:50.570 --> 19:52.110
HE THINKS YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

19:52.111 --> 19:54.071
NO, I'M NOT THE GREATEST.

19:54.073 --> 19:55.913
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

19:55.905 --> 19:58.695
YOU ARE SUPERWOMAN.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.778
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
WHAT?

20:00.780 --> 20:03.200
SOMETIMES EVEN SUPERWOMAN
NEEDS SUPERMAN

20:03.202 --> 20:05.542
TO FLY IN
AND STRAIGHTEN OUT HER CAPE.

20:05.535 --> 20:08.495
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.288
AND I GUESS SUPERMAN

20:10.290 --> 20:14.710
COULD USE HIS CAPE
STRAIGHTENED OCCASIONALLY, TOO.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.644
THAT WOULD BE NICE.

20:17.637 --> 20:18.757
I GUESS IF I'M SUPERMAN,

20:18.758 --> 20:20.598
I KNOW WHAT
MY KRYPTONITE IS.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.800
WHAT'S THAT?

20:21.801 --> 20:24.261
IT'S MY FAMILY.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.774
AND IF I'M SUPERWOMAN,

20:25.765 --> 20:28.185
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT MY KRYPTONITE IS?

20:28.187 --> 20:31.017
YOU. YOU'RE THE ONLY THING
THAT MAKES ME WEAK.

20:31.020 --> 20:33.560
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

20:33.563 --> 20:34.693
HA HA HA!

20:43.913 --> 20:46.083
IT'S NOT THE SAME
AS WHEN WE WERE KIDS.

20:46.075 --> 20:47.915
THEY SHOOT NOWADAYS.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:47.917 --> 20:49.457
CLAIRE DIDN'T HAVE TO
ATTACK THAT BOY.

20:49.459 --> 20:50.959
SHE ATTACKED THAT BOY --
HA HA.

20:50.960 --> 20:52.920
HA!

20:52.922 --> 20:54.292
I WASN'T THERE FOR CLAIRE

20:54.294 --> 20:56.514
WHEN SHE TURNED INTO
SMOKIN' JOSEPHINE FRAZIER,

20:56.506 --> 20:59.006
BUT NOW I'M ON TOP OF IT.

21:00.800 --> 21:02.800
I'M NOT.
