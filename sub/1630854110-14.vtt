WEBVTT

00:04.482 --> 00:07.050
<i>Dr. Ben Song risked
everything when he used</i>

00:07.050 --> 00:10.619
<i>the Quantum Leap Accelerator
to travel back in time.</i>

00:10.619 --> 00:13.404
<i>Now our team's working
to find out why.</i>

00:13.404 --> 00:17.234
<i>As he leaps between bodies
with no memory of who he is,</i>

00:17.234 --> 00:19.236
<i>he still has one hope--</i>

00:19.236 --> 00:23.588
<i>that his next leap
takes him back</i>

00:23.588 --> 00:28.332
<i>to the place and people
he calls home.</i>

00:54.010 --> 00:55.794
Holy shit.

01:05.021 --> 01:06.979
Ops, you okay?

01:06.979 --> 01:09.243
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

01:12.637 --> 01:14.726
Man your station.

01:14.726 --> 01:16.032
Move.

01:16.032 --> 01:17.729
Number four come in.
Number four.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.340
This is the TAO.

01:19.340 --> 01:21.907
Multiple inbound Bandits.
Multiple surface contacts.

01:21.907 --> 01:23.213
They've got to be bluffing.

01:23.213 --> 01:24.562
Those aircraft started for us

01:24.562 --> 01:26.173
just as those missile boats
cut us off.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.739
Does that sound
like a bluff to you?

01:27.739 --> 01:29.045
Captain, hostile aircraft
are 20 miles.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.220
Do you wish to engage?

01:30.220 --> 01:31.700
Arm the Harpoons and Phalanx.

01:31.700 --> 01:33.528
Bring the 5-inch guns to bear.
- Copy.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.573
Arm the Harpoons.
Arm the Phalanx.

01:35.573 --> 01:37.097
Bring the 5-inch guns to bear.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.359
Commander Rossi,
number four turret

01:38.359 --> 01:40.361
isn't answering, sir.

01:40.361 --> 01:42.058
Commander Rossi, sir,

01:42.058 --> 01:43.625
number four turret
isn't answering.

01:43.625 --> 01:45.235
Ops, are you
gonna get on that

01:45.235 --> 01:46.932
or do have to do it myself?

01:46.932 --> 01:49.413
Aye, aye, sir.

01:49.413 --> 01:51.154
Do you have a visual
on the contact?

01:51.154 --> 01:53.156
Bearing 351?

01:53.156 --> 01:55.289
351. Yes, Captain.

01:56.768 --> 01:58.161
Let's go.

01:58.161 --> 02:00.424
Commander Rossi,
we've lost Comms, sir.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.644
But she's still answering
fire control and ready to--

02:06.996 --> 02:08.737
This is insane!

02:11.305 --> 02:12.871
Turret four operational, sir.

02:12.871 --> 02:14.221
And now.

02:14.221 --> 02:16.179
Target one: destroyed.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.268
Target two: destroyed.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.792
Inbound aircraft...

02:20.792 --> 02:22.838
destroyed.

02:22.838 --> 02:24.753
Threat board clear, Captain.

02:27.234 --> 02:29.714
What war is this?

02:29.714 --> 02:32.195
One I hope we never
have to fight.

02:33.979 --> 02:35.459
Great work, everyone.

02:36.591 --> 02:38.462
<i>This is the XO. All clear.</i>

02:38.462 --> 02:40.203
<i>This ends the readiness drill.</i>

02:40.203 --> 02:41.944
It was a drill.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.599
It was a drill.

02:46.209 --> 02:48.559
Captain on the bridge.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.213
How'd we do, Captain?

02:50.213 --> 02:52.302
Good, but we can do better,

02:52.302 --> 02:54.565
especially with the Chinese watching.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.959
Is that sub still shadowing us?

02:56.959 --> 02:59.222
Disappeared the minute
we started the drill.

02:59.222 --> 03:02.182
But I can confirm that
it's Chinese, Han class.

03:02.182 --> 03:03.444
Probably wants
a front-row seat

03:03.444 --> 03:04.793
for the war games.

03:04.793 --> 03:06.708
Make sure she stays gone.

03:07.665 --> 03:09.624
All hands, this is the captain.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.147
I want to congratulate you

03:11.147 --> 03:13.715
on another
outstanding performance.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.848
<i>Our ship is about
to be the centerpiece</i>

03:16.848 --> 03:19.677
<i>of joint exercises
between our Navy,</i>

03:19.677 --> 03:22.289
<i>the South Koreans,
and the Australians.</i>

03:22.289 --> 03:23.855
<i>It's a great honor.</i>

03:23.855 --> 03:26.597
<i>But I want you to remember
the bigger picture:</i>

03:26.597 --> 03:29.470
we are in the East China Sea,

03:29.470 --> 03:31.733
the most dangerous waters
on Earth.

03:33.125 --> 03:34.344
Come on.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.259
And the Chinese think that

03:36.259 --> 03:39.088
they are the world's
next great superpower.

03:39.088 --> 03:41.003
I happen to disagree.

03:41.003 --> 03:42.831
I always knew you'd
look great in a uniform.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.920
Oh, Addison,
I know I say this a lot,

03:44.920 --> 03:47.836
but it is really good
to see you.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.881
I thought I had leapt
into the middle of a war.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.056
Where am I?

03:51.056 --> 03:54.277
Uh, we still don't know.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.279
Ziggy's--
- Ziggy's running slow.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.238
Yeah, if I ever started a band,
that's what I'm naming it.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.848
- Yeah.
- But the weirdest part

03:59.848 --> 04:02.720
is all of this feels strangely
familiar somehow.

04:02.720 --> 04:04.244
Was I ever--

04:04.244 --> 04:06.681
Like you were in the Navy?

04:06.681 --> 04:07.943
No.

04:07.943 --> 04:09.858
But you are in my world now.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.294
So this shouldn't be
too hard to figure out.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.818
Okay, you are Commander Rossi.

04:13.818 --> 04:16.038
He called you "Ops"
so I'm guessing

04:16.038 --> 04:17.735
you're the operations officer

04:17.735 --> 04:20.260
and you're on a battleship so,

04:20.260 --> 04:22.087
you know,
that narrows it down a lot.

04:22.087 --> 04:25.177
<i>Men, there is no
such thing as peace,</i>

04:25.177 --> 04:27.745
<i>only pauses between wars.</i>

04:27.745 --> 04:29.878
I know that speech.

04:29.878 --> 04:31.836
He's quoting one
of the Navy's all time gr--

04:31.836 --> 04:34.752
<i>And in those pauses,
hundreds of skirmishes</i>

04:34.752 --> 04:36.972
<i>that never make the papers.</i>

04:38.278 --> 04:40.105
Addison, what's wrong?

04:40.105 --> 04:42.107
We are the tip of the spear.

04:42.107 --> 04:46.982
We protect the greatest nation
in the history of history.

04:46.982 --> 04:49.114
Let that honor sink in.

04:49.114 --> 04:52.509
Let that honor be your guide.

04:52.509 --> 04:56.208
Ben, you are on
the USS "Montana."

04:56.208 --> 04:59.647
This is Captain Bill Drake.

05:02.998 --> 05:06.393
And that is my father.

05:23.758 --> 05:25.194
My head hurts.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.674
That's my line.

05:26.674 --> 05:28.284
Yeah, well in case
you hadn't noticed,

05:28.284 --> 05:29.894
today is all-bets-are-off day.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.593
Ian, you said there's
no way to target

05:32.593 --> 05:34.203
a specific place and time.

05:34.203 --> 05:36.684
Well, no way for us to target
a specific place and time.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.381
You think
Ben figured out how?

05:38.381 --> 05:39.469
No.

05:39.469 --> 05:41.253
Then it's a coincidence.

05:41.253 --> 05:44.082
Magic, part of my job here
is accepting the fact

05:44.082 --> 05:46.128
that there is still
a lot that we don't know

05:46.128 --> 05:47.564
about the Quantum Accelerator.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.218
And maybe one day I'm gonna
have all the answers,

05:49.218 --> 05:52.874
but for now, all I know is--

05:52.874 --> 05:55.833
We're on a leap
with your father?

05:55.833 --> 05:57.444
Yeah.

05:57.444 --> 05:58.793
Are you okay?

06:00.882 --> 06:03.537
At least I know why
this felt familiar.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.669
I don't remember
the particulars,

06:05.669 --> 06:08.498
just that you've told me
about this before.

06:08.498 --> 06:10.239
Addison, if you want
to take this leap off,

06:10.239 --> 06:12.676
I will totally understand.

06:12.676 --> 06:14.983
I can't take it off, Ben.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.811
Don't stand there, man,
tie that down.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.290
Uh, I'll tell you why
in a minute.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.380
But first you need
to stop talking.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.729
Commander.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.034
You're in the Navy.

06:23.034 --> 06:24.862
You can't be seen
conversing with yourself.

06:24.862 --> 06:26.516
Okay, well,
the good news is that

06:26.516 --> 06:27.996
you're the operations officer,

06:27.996 --> 06:30.085
which means not only are you
third in command,

06:30.085 --> 06:32.696
but the entire ship
is your domain.

06:32.696 --> 06:34.437
In fact, the most
conspicuous thing

06:34.437 --> 06:36.657
you can do--
besides talking to me--

06:36.657 --> 06:38.702
is stay in one spot
for too long.

06:38.702 --> 06:42.837
So let's walk and I will
tell you why you're here.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.885
May 2, 1989--

06:47.885 --> 06:50.801
a date not many
outside of the Navy remember,

06:50.801 --> 06:54.326
but those of us who served
will never forget.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.720
At just past 1900 hours--

06:56.720 --> 06:58.766
The ship picked up
a distress signal.

06:58.766 --> 07:01.072
<i>Bridge, Comms, we have
a possible distress call</i>

07:01.072 --> 07:03.510
<i>broadcast in the clear
on 2182 kilohertz.</i>

07:03.510 --> 07:05.468
A fragment, really--

07:05.468 --> 07:07.905
impossible to confirm
and not repeated.

07:07.905 --> 07:10.125
My father decided
not to pursue it...

07:12.432 --> 07:16.436
Nor tell Captain Drake...

07:16.436 --> 07:18.568
Which was a mistake.

07:18.568 --> 07:21.092
It turned out
the distress signal was

07:21.092 --> 07:22.920
from the USS "Tampa,"

07:22.920 --> 07:25.445
a submarine conducting
a top-secret mission

07:25.445 --> 07:27.011
off the coast of China.

07:27.011 --> 07:29.361
Apparently, there was
an explosion on board

07:29.361 --> 07:31.407
and it started to sink.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.496
The trouble was,
no one in the fleet

07:33.496 --> 07:35.542
knew the "Tampa" was there

07:35.542 --> 07:38.283
and no one besides
the "Montana"

07:38.283 --> 07:40.155
picked up the transmission.

07:40.155 --> 07:41.504
And as a result,

07:41.504 --> 07:45.465
all 138 sailors
aboard her died.

07:45.465 --> 07:47.423
I'm sorry.

07:47.423 --> 07:48.903
Me too.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.687
The Navy launched
an investigation.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.776
And while no charges
were filed,

07:52.776 --> 07:54.735
my father's reputation was--

07:54.735 --> 07:56.519
well, let's just say
he was encouraged

07:56.519 --> 07:58.173
to leave active duty.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.610
Magic, if I'm
hearing you right,

08:00.610 --> 08:03.221
then Addison is being
given the opportunity

08:03.221 --> 08:05.267
to prevent one of the most
painful things that

08:05.267 --> 08:06.616
ever happened to her father.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.662
But risk her life
in the process.

08:08.662 --> 08:11.229
I mean, I can't be
the only one thinking this.

08:11.229 --> 08:13.275
If I help answer
that distress call,

08:13.275 --> 08:14.972
what happens to you?

08:14.972 --> 08:16.496
Addison, we're not
talking about changing

08:16.496 --> 08:17.888
something small here.

08:17.888 --> 08:20.064
Who's to say it's not
like "Back to the Future?"

08:20.064 --> 08:22.197
What if Addison ceases
to exist?

08:22.197 --> 08:24.329
Okay, okay. Easy, McFly.

08:24.329 --> 08:26.723
Addison was already born
in 1989.

08:26.723 --> 08:29.378
And despite what pop culture
would want you to think,

08:29.378 --> 08:32.512
it would take significant
changes to a person's life

08:32.512 --> 08:33.730
in order for it to have impact

08:33.730 --> 08:36.124
on any of their loved ones downstream.

08:36.124 --> 08:38.387
My father is
the most stoic man that

08:38.387 --> 08:39.910
I have ever met.

08:39.910 --> 08:42.565
He doesn't stress
and he doesn't show emotion.

08:42.565 --> 08:46.656
When I was a kid, I didn't
even know he knew how to smile.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.353
He's not gonna change.

08:48.353 --> 08:49.572
Even if we do this,

08:49.572 --> 08:53.707
he will still
be the man I know.

08:53.707 --> 08:55.578
And he will still
leave my mom and me.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.188
Addison, I don't know.

08:57.188 --> 08:59.974
Then it's a good thing
it's not your choice.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.542
Ben, fate brought us here
so that I could

09:02.542 --> 09:04.282
save the lives of all
of those men that

09:04.282 --> 09:07.198
died because of my father.

09:07.198 --> 09:10.767
Please help me do that.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.117
When does the call come in?

09:13.117 --> 09:14.684
Soon.

09:14.684 --> 09:16.120
We should get to the bridge.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.342
<i>I don't know, Captain.</i>

09:20.342 --> 09:22.605
Was it a treaty?

09:22.605 --> 09:25.739
Oh, Master Chief,
you disappoint me.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.697
Commander Rossi,
since you're here,

09:27.697 --> 09:29.612
maybe you can tell
the Master Chief

09:29.612 --> 09:32.397
why the "Montana"
is 127 feet tall

09:32.397 --> 09:34.095
and not a foot taller.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.273
I don't know.
I was in the Army.

09:41.450 --> 09:42.886
Et tu, Brute?

09:42.886 --> 09:45.410
XO, enlighten these cretins.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.630
127 feet is how high
the Brooklyn Bridge sits

09:47.630 --> 09:49.197
above the East River.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.416
And the "Montana" was built
in the Brooklyn Navy yard--

09:51.416 --> 09:53.854
by women, no less,

09:53.854 --> 09:56.639
which means I guess they're
good for two things.

09:56.639 --> 09:57.858
Charming.

09:58.859 --> 10:00.861
CEC, Bridge.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.340
<i>Any sign of that Chinese sub?</i>

10:02.340 --> 10:04.255
<i>She ran and hid
during the drill.</i>

10:04.255 --> 10:05.692
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

10:05.692 --> 10:07.607
<i>She's 5,000 yards
to our stern.</i>

10:07.607 --> 10:09.260
She's back?

10:09.260 --> 10:10.610
You got her scope?

10:10.610 --> 10:12.046
<i>Yes, Captain.</i>

10:13.395 --> 10:15.440
Light her up with
our fire control radar.

10:15.440 --> 10:16.746
<i>Aye-aye, sir.</i>

10:16.746 --> 10:18.922
Ben, training the ship's
fire control radar

10:18.922 --> 10:20.532
on a vessel
is considered hostile.

10:20.532 --> 10:22.709
The Chinese could think
they're under attack.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.625
Captain, that's
a very provocative action.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.801
Yes, XO.
That's why I'm doing it.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.934
War games start at 0900.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.762
You think we should allow
that Han down there

10:32.762 --> 10:34.938
to just follow us
with impunity?

10:34.938 --> 10:38.333
Respectfully, yes, sir.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.944
Let's scare 'em
with what we can do,

10:40.944 --> 10:43.425
not give some
no-name sub driver an excuse

10:43.425 --> 10:45.166
to take a cheap shot at us.

10:50.258 --> 10:52.086
CEC, belay that order.

10:52.086 --> 10:55.089
We'll let that
Han slide for now.

10:58.832 --> 11:01.312
XO, you have the bridge.

11:01.312 --> 11:02.792
XO has the bridge.

11:04.359 --> 11:05.621
XO.

11:05.621 --> 11:07.188
Not now, Master Chief.

11:09.016 --> 11:12.280
- But he's getting worse.
- I said not now.

11:16.327 --> 11:20.375
That is the most upset
I have ever seen him.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.161
<i>Bridge, Comms.</i>

11:24.161 --> 11:25.859
<i>We have a possible
distress call</i>

11:25.859 --> 11:28.557
<i>broadcast in the clear
on 2182 kilohertz.</i>

11:30.646 --> 11:31.865
Can you bring that up?

11:31.865 --> 11:33.301
Okay, Ben. This is it.

11:33.301 --> 11:35.912
This is the SOS
my father ignores.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.916
We're here, sir.

11:39.916 --> 11:42.005
And Comms puts the origin
of that signal about here.

11:42.005 --> 11:44.181
Right next to Chinese
territorial waters.

11:44.181 --> 11:45.530
They said the call
might have been in English

11:45.530 --> 11:46.749
or might have been gibberish.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.446
One fragment, not repeated.

11:48.446 --> 11:49.970
Nothing since.

11:49.970 --> 11:51.841
Okay, remember, they don't
know it's the "Tampa."

11:51.841 --> 11:53.713
You have to get them
to investigate it.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.018
An HF signal?

11:55.018 --> 11:56.759
Sounds like
the Chinese to me, sir.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.283
I agree, not to mention
that fleet says

11:59.283 --> 12:01.329
we don't have a ship
within 50 miles of that.

12:07.378 --> 12:11.165
Understood, but we don't turn
our backs on a distress call.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.470
both: What?

12:14.908 --> 12:16.823
Are we going to do?

12:16.823 --> 12:18.999
Officer of the Deck, we're
gonna close that distress call

12:18.999 --> 12:20.740
on a course of 310, ahead full.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.611
Come to 310, ahead full.

12:22.611 --> 12:23.830
Aye, sir.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.528
In the original timeline,
he ignored the transmission.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.138
I don't understand.

12:28.138 --> 12:30.227
Did we change
something already?

12:30.227 --> 12:31.751
Comms, let fleet
know we're disengaging

12:31.751 --> 12:32.926
from the war games.

12:32.926 --> 12:34.231
Responding to a distress call.

12:34.231 --> 12:36.712
Helm, cancel
that course change.

12:36.712 --> 12:38.714
XO, what the hell
are you thinking?

12:38.714 --> 12:40.237
We're not going anywhere.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.718
It wasn't your father who
ignored the distress call.

12:50.247 --> 12:51.727
Sir, we received
a distress call.

12:51.727 --> 12:54.121
A fragment of a call,
broadcast from Chinese waters.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.297
Tell me you're not that naive,
Commander Augustine.

12:56.297 --> 12:57.559
Sir.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.300
We are the flagship
of these war games.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.563
Now can you imagine
what a feather it'd be

13:01.563 --> 13:04.740
in the Chinese workers' cap
if they could get us

13:04.740 --> 13:06.437
going off on a wild goose chase

13:06.437 --> 13:09.223
with some Han-class sub
on our ass.

13:09.223 --> 13:11.834
International law requires
all ships at sea

13:11.834 --> 13:13.270
to respond
to a distress signal.

13:13.270 --> 13:15.664
A spoofed rescue is the
oldest trick in the book.

13:15.664 --> 13:17.318
We're not falling for it.

13:17.318 --> 13:18.754
Is that understood?

13:24.542 --> 13:26.153
You have a good heart.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.809
But it's an affliction
that I've seen

13:29.809 --> 13:32.289
kill many a fine man.

13:35.902 --> 13:36.946
Carry on.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.513
Aye, sir.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.994
All pods maintain
current status.

13:42.517 --> 13:44.127
It wasn't him.

13:45.302 --> 13:49.350
All these years,
he never said anything.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.352
But he didn't abandon
those sailors.

13:51.352 --> 13:53.006
The captain did.

13:54.529 --> 13:57.053
XO, I think you're
right about that call.

13:57.053 --> 13:59.273
I think it's one of ours.

13:59.273 --> 14:02.015
If you think I'm right, Ops,
help me find proof.

14:04.713 --> 14:05.932
You heard him.

14:05.932 --> 14:07.542
Ian, what can we do to help?

14:07.542 --> 14:10.153
I pulled up the specs on
the ship's communications array

14:10.153 --> 14:13.026
and I have tasked Ziggy
with finding Ben a way

14:13.026 --> 14:15.637
to prove that the call
came from the "Tampa."

14:15.637 --> 14:16.899
Make it good.

14:16.899 --> 14:19.075
Drake was famous
for being stubborn.

14:19.075 --> 14:21.730
Speaking of Drake, I've
combed through every report

14:21.730 --> 14:23.166
on this incident
and there's not even

14:23.166 --> 14:24.907
a hint that the decision
to ignore the distress call

14:24.907 --> 14:26.039
was his.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.649
The man was a legend.

14:27.649 --> 14:30.870
Addison's father fell on his
sword to protect that legend.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.697
Why?

14:32.697 --> 14:34.917
Because sometimes doing
what's best for the service

14:34.917 --> 14:37.311
requires sacrifice.

14:37.311 --> 14:40.009
Okay, but if the official
report was wrong about that,

14:40.009 --> 14:42.142
what else could
it be wrong about?

14:42.142 --> 14:43.795
What are you saying?

14:43.795 --> 14:45.232
The explosion that happened
on the ship, the "Tampa,"

14:45.232 --> 14:47.103
was caused from something.

14:47.103 --> 14:49.192
If we want Ben and Addison
to survive this leap,

14:49.192 --> 14:51.542
we need to know
what really happened in 1989,

14:51.542 --> 14:54.371
including the Chinese
version of the events.

14:54.371 --> 14:55.938
Aren't you still
friendly with the guy

14:55.938 --> 14:57.113
who served as your counterpart

14:57.113 --> 14:58.941
in the Chinese Navy
at the time?

14:58.941 --> 15:02.031
Liu Wei, he's a CEO now.

15:02.031 --> 15:03.206
I'll call him.

15:03.206 --> 15:05.513
Hey, we've got something.

15:05.513 --> 15:07.341
Since the fragment we
picked up was unencrypted,

15:07.341 --> 15:10.213
there's a way to identify
it as friend or foe.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.042
See the head of each signal?

15:13.042 --> 15:14.348
Chinese transmission has

15:14.348 --> 15:16.176
a different signature than
ours do,

15:16.176 --> 15:17.699
so we can check
the fragment's waveform,

15:17.699 --> 15:19.527
see which it matches.

15:19.527 --> 15:21.659
Good idea, Ops.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.313
Do it.

15:23.313 --> 15:25.402
Okay, grab that handset.
Hit the button.

15:25.402 --> 15:26.969
Talk on the mic.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.364
<i>Comms, Lieutenant Walker.</i>

15:30.364 --> 15:32.757
Walker, do you have
that distress call?

15:32.757 --> 15:34.629
<i>No, I threw it in the trash.</i>

15:34.629 --> 15:37.066
<i>Come on, Ops, what kind
of question is that?</i>

15:37.066 --> 15:38.676
Yeah, right.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.548
Can you compare the header
of the waveform

15:40.548 --> 15:42.985
to samples from our
transmissions and the Chinese?

15:42.985 --> 15:44.508
<i>Standby.</i>

15:47.076 --> 15:48.425
<i>It's one of ours.</i>

15:48.425 --> 15:49.600
<i>Good catch.</i>

15:49.600 --> 15:50.993
<i>How'd you ever
think of that, Ops?</i>

15:50.993 --> 15:52.386
Yes.

15:57.913 --> 16:03.614
XO, plot an intercept course,
best speed to that location.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.622
U.S. sailors in distress.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.189
I hate to think what
would have happened

16:13.189 --> 16:15.539
if you hadn't pulled that
rabbit out of your hat, Ops.

16:15.539 --> 16:18.107
That's why they pay me
the big bucks, sir.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.892
Seriously...

16:20.892 --> 16:22.285
thank you.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.686
XO on the bridge.

16:31.686 --> 16:33.427
Sir, the course is 310.

16:33.427 --> 16:36.082
Estimated time to intercept:
four hours.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.084
Thank you, Master Chief.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.607
Why don't you and Ops
grab some rack.

16:39.607 --> 16:41.000
I think it's gonna
to be a long day.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.175
<i>Clear port bow.</i>

16:42.175 --> 16:44.046
<i>Stand by fire.</i>

16:49.008 --> 16:50.096
What was that?

16:50.096 --> 16:51.358
It sounded like torpedoes.

16:51.358 --> 16:52.968
He's lost his damn mind.

16:56.232 --> 16:58.321
Our torpedo is bearing 210.

16:58.321 --> 17:00.715
Range 900 yards to target.

17:00.715 --> 17:02.108
We fired at them.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.546
- Captain.
- We're on our way to rescue

17:05.546 --> 17:07.287
a U.S. vessel
near Chinese waters.

17:07.287 --> 17:10.333
The last thing I'm gonna do
is let that Han follow me.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.033
Sir, you're starting a war.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.124
You're a hero tonight, Ops,
but forget yourself again

17:18.124 --> 17:19.516
and you'll be in the brig.

17:19.516 --> 17:21.040
Is that clear?

17:22.345 --> 17:24.826
Ben, say, "Yes, sir,"
and apologize.

17:27.176 --> 17:29.135
Yes, Captain.

17:29.135 --> 17:31.224
Sorry, sir.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.704
Besides,
I'm not starting anything.

17:33.704 --> 17:37.186
I'm merely giving our
Chinese friends a good scare.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.237
Master Chief, you're familiar
with the concept

17:44.237 --> 17:46.848
of a warning shot, are you not?

17:46.848 --> 17:48.632
I am, sir.

17:48.632 --> 17:52.027
And XO, have we or have
we not played this game

17:52.027 --> 17:54.334
with the Russians 100 times?

17:54.334 --> 17:56.858
Not with live torpedoes, sir.

17:56.858 --> 18:00.166
<i>Torpedo now safely
clear of the Han.</i>

18:00.166 --> 18:01.515
Maybe not.

18:09.175 --> 18:11.873
But this way,
that Han won't forget

18:11.873 --> 18:14.310
who's the big bad wolf.

18:16.007 --> 18:17.139
Transients from the sub.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.054
He must be changing depth.

18:19.054 --> 18:20.534
What's that sub doing now?

18:20.534 --> 18:22.144
Bugged out, sir.
I've lost her.

18:23.406 --> 18:26.409
Now let's go be heroes.

18:28.933 --> 18:31.545
- Sir, I--
- Not here.

18:31.545 --> 18:33.112
Come on.

18:36.245 --> 18:38.247
Trade relations, huh?

18:38.247 --> 18:40.075
A different kind
of war than the one

18:40.075 --> 18:41.468
we had to worry about--

18:41.468 --> 18:43.165
harder to figure out
who your enemies are.

18:44.775 --> 18:51.565
So the reason for my call--
May 2, 1989.

18:51.565 --> 18:53.828
A sad day.

18:53.828 --> 18:55.482
Why ask about it now?

18:55.482 --> 18:59.225
I know our submarine,
the "Tampa" wasn't far off

18:59.225 --> 19:02.010
your coast when it sank.

19:02.010 --> 19:03.794
I'm wondering what you know.

19:06.406 --> 19:09.148
I'm glad we're talking, Magic,

19:09.148 --> 19:12.412
because we weren't in 1989.

19:12.412 --> 19:17.895
And as a result, we came close
to something very bad.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.779
Now shut the door.

19:39.526 --> 19:40.570
Listen--

19:40.570 --> 19:42.181
How old is your daughter?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.881
She's two and a half.

19:48.230 --> 19:51.799
She looks just like you.

19:51.799 --> 19:55.063
Yeah, Addie--

19:55.063 --> 19:57.239
Addie's perfect.

19:57.239 --> 20:00.329
I don't know why heaven would
ever entrust an angel like her

20:00.329 --> 20:03.419
to a guy like me, but...

20:06.292 --> 20:09.251
Look, Ops, I don't know
what's going on--

20:09.251 --> 20:10.861
the way you're talking
to the captain.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.994
Do you want to get
kicked out of the Navy?

20:12.994 --> 20:14.691
I'm worried about him.

20:17.825 --> 20:21.785
He's having a rough time
with the loss of his wife.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.397
With all due respect,
I heard the Master Chief.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.963
He's getting worse.

20:25.963 --> 20:29.619
I will not tolerate that
kind of talk aboard this ship.

20:29.619 --> 20:32.013
I have served for Captain Drake
for almost 20 years.

20:32.013 --> 20:33.797
He is a great man.

20:35.321 --> 20:36.887
He is.

20:39.716 --> 20:42.371
Sir, what's really going on?

20:46.549 --> 20:49.987
You, uh, like
your family, Rossi?

20:51.337 --> 20:55.166
Ben, my dad never
talked about his family.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.864
You know, the usual.

20:56.864 --> 20:58.300
Love, hate.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.564
Well, my dad was
a son of a bitch.

21:01.564 --> 21:03.174
The only time he
stopped drinking was

21:03.174 --> 21:05.655
when he was beating
on me or my mom.

21:08.484 --> 21:10.530
When I was 18,
I snapped, fought back,

21:10.530 --> 21:13.576
and nearly killed him.

21:13.576 --> 21:17.450
Left town that night,
joined up, and never went back.

21:17.450 --> 21:20.017
Look, point is,

21:20.017 --> 21:22.672
I was a wreck when I enlisted.

21:22.672 --> 21:26.720
But Captain Drake
saw something in me.

21:26.720 --> 21:29.679
He's the one that got me
into the Academy.

21:29.679 --> 21:31.551
And he's the one that
taught me how to be

21:31.551 --> 21:33.857
something other than angry.

21:34.858 --> 21:39.733
Look, I'm not saying he's
not gonna have his bad days,

21:39.733 --> 21:41.387
but I will keep him in check.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.258
Do you understand me?
- Sir, if I could just--

21:43.258 --> 21:45.478
Do you understand me?

21:49.046 --> 21:50.787
Dismissed.

21:59.492 --> 22:02.103
How are you holding up?

22:02.103 --> 22:04.323
Yeah.

22:04.323 --> 22:07.674
You know, I know
this might be tough

22:07.674 --> 22:10.154
and I might see a side
of him that I didn't

22:10.154 --> 22:12.505
see as a kid, but--

22:13.854 --> 22:15.421
But?

22:16.639 --> 22:19.816
Why was he so cold
to me growing up?

22:24.125 --> 22:26.432
Saved by the bell.

22:26.432 --> 22:30.218
Or in this case,
an incredibly fickle AI.

22:30.218 --> 22:32.002
Okay, that can't be right.

22:32.002 --> 22:33.352
What?

22:33.352 --> 22:35.658
Ziggy says all 138 sailors
aboard the "Tampa"

22:35.658 --> 22:37.965
still die because
no one rescues them.

22:37.965 --> 22:39.836
How is that possible?

22:46.103 --> 22:47.801
<i>General quarters,
general quarters.</i>

22:47.801 --> 22:49.716
<i>All hands man your
battle stations.</i>

22:49.716 --> 22:52.022
<i>Detonation port side.</i>

22:52.022 --> 22:55.678
I guess us sinking would
explain the lack of rescue.

23:00.509 --> 23:01.989
All stations,
make damage control reports.

23:01.989 --> 23:03.382
Damage control station manned.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.209
Sir, report
from damage control.

23:05.209 --> 23:06.994
Number one shaft is frozen

23:06.994 --> 23:09.213
and Mounts 51 and 53
are inoperable.

23:09.213 --> 23:11.302
- Are we sinking?
- No, sir.

23:11.302 --> 23:14.044
It'd take a lot more than that
to knock us out of the fight.

23:14.044 --> 23:16.046
If CEC didn't
pick up a torpedo,

23:16.046 --> 23:17.526
how can we be sure we
were hit by a torpedo?

23:17.526 --> 23:19.223
We're out in the middle
of nowhere.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.877
If it wasn't the Han that
hit us, who was it?

23:20.877 --> 23:22.401
Moby Dick?
- Do you have him?

23:22.401 --> 23:23.576
- No, sir.
- All right.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.186
When you do, I want
a solution plotted

23:25.186 --> 23:27.406
and ready to fire
on my command.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.755
Aye, aye, sir.

23:31.627 --> 23:34.238
Ops, I want you to review
the Link-11

23:34.238 --> 23:35.457
for the last 15 minutes.

23:35.457 --> 23:36.893
He doesn't think
it was a torpedo.

23:36.893 --> 23:38.373
You don't think
it was a torpedo?

23:38.373 --> 23:40.157
If it was, how did
$50 million worth

23:40.157 --> 23:42.203
of electronics miss it?

23:42.203 --> 23:43.465
He's gonna sink that sub

23:43.465 --> 23:45.075
if I can't prove
it wasn't them.

23:45.075 --> 23:46.425
How long do I have?

23:46.425 --> 23:48.252
Called for an SH-3
from the Yorktown.

23:48.252 --> 23:49.732
That's a
sub-hunting helicopter

23:49.732 --> 23:51.255
from a cruiser nearby.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.649
I figure we'll have five
minutes till it finds them.

23:55.477 --> 23:58.567
If it wasn't a torpedo,
what was it?

23:58.567 --> 24:00.003
A mine?

24:00.003 --> 24:02.136
You're saying a mine
sunk the "Tampa."

24:02.136 --> 24:04.399
In '89,
our leadership knew that

24:04.399 --> 24:06.662
American submarines were
testing the limits

24:06.662 --> 24:08.490
of Chinese territorial waters.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.579
We laid mines all
along the coast.

24:10.579 --> 24:12.799
Figuring if one of
our subs hit a mine,

24:12.799 --> 24:15.279
it would be forced to surface

24:15.279 --> 24:17.325
and America would be
forced to admit

24:17.325 --> 24:20.067
they violated Chinese waters.

24:20.067 --> 24:22.025
We'd hold your crew
for a few weeks

24:22.025 --> 24:23.723
as a show of outrage.

24:23.723 --> 24:27.422
But really we would be tearing
your submarine apart

24:27.422 --> 24:29.946
and stealing all
the technology.

24:29.946 --> 24:33.210
In fairness,
it's a good plan.

24:33.210 --> 24:36.170
Except we didn't
account for the weather.

24:36.170 --> 24:40.304
One bad storm,
and over 50 mines broke free

24:40.304 --> 24:42.393
and drifted out
into the open ocean

24:42.393 --> 24:45.092
directly towards
your war games.

24:45.092 --> 24:49.444
One of those mines sank
the "Tampa."

24:49.444 --> 24:51.098
And if the currents
had been stronger,

24:51.098 --> 24:52.403
they would have drifted
toward your fleet

24:52.403 --> 24:54.318
and started World War III.

24:54.318 --> 24:58.148
We got lucky in '89, Magic.

24:58.148 --> 25:00.673
Let's hope that
never happens again.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.024
Magic?

25:04.024 --> 25:05.982
Jenn, Ben is sailing
into a minefield.

25:05.982 --> 25:07.244
Minefield?

25:07.244 --> 25:09.333
Wait a minute. That's great.

25:09.333 --> 25:12.249
Great?
Why is that great?

25:12.249 --> 25:13.599
Because if we know
it was a mine,

25:13.599 --> 25:15.296
then all I have to do
is find others.

25:15.296 --> 25:16.602
That's great.

25:16.602 --> 25:17.994
How do we do that?

25:17.994 --> 25:20.344
I was hoping you would know.

25:20.344 --> 25:23.260
Okay, tell me everything
there is to know about mines.

25:23.260 --> 25:26.786
Helicopter on-station.
Dropping sonar buoys now.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.614
Okay.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.485
The first Chinese mine
was the M1,

25:30.485 --> 25:32.748
which was actually
a model of Soviet design.

25:32.748 --> 25:35.229
By the 1980s,
Chinese minesweepers were

25:35.229 --> 25:37.361
being made
with low-resonant steel.

25:37.361 --> 25:39.059
To be resistant to sonar.

25:39.059 --> 25:41.191
But sonar is just sound waves.

25:41.191 --> 25:43.150
Okay, I need to call
the radio room.

25:44.499 --> 25:45.892
Let's calibrate
the sonar buoys

25:45.892 --> 25:47.415
before we start the sweep.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.592
<i>This another one
of your magic tricks, Ops?</i>

25:50.592 --> 25:52.507
- Walker, can you do it?
<i>- Sure.</i>

25:52.507 --> 25:54.683
<i>But it'll take five seconds
to run the whole spectrum</i>

25:54.683 --> 25:55.728
<i>starting now.</i>

25:55.728 --> 25:57.686
<i>One Mississippi,
two Mississippi.</i>

25:57.686 --> 25:58.818
- Walker.
<i>- What?</i>

25:58.818 --> 26:00.559
<i>It's an accurate
way to keep time.</i>

26:00.559 --> 26:02.648
<i>Plus, I'm from Mississippi.</i>

26:04.475 --> 26:05.651
Calibration complete.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.000
Commencing search
of the surrounding waters

26:07.000 --> 26:08.131
for the Han.

26:10.003 --> 26:12.527
<i>Four Mississippi, five.</i>

26:12.527 --> 26:14.311
Multiple surface contacts.

26:16.749 --> 26:18.577
Range and bearings
all over the place,

26:18.577 --> 26:20.317
but they're not moving.
- Because they're mines.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.841
The Chinese didn't shoot at us.

26:21.841 --> 26:24.278
We hit a mine that broke loose
from its moorings.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.417
Captain, it wasn't a torpedo.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.115
We hit a mine, sir.

26:36.159 --> 26:37.596
Very well.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.252
Continue the sonar sweep.

26:42.252 --> 26:44.428
And when you find that Han,
fire at will.

26:44.428 --> 26:46.779
- But, sir, wasn't them.
<i>- No?</i>

26:46.779 --> 26:48.432
Then where did that
mine come from?

26:48.432 --> 26:49.912
Do you think
it's a coincidence

26:49.912 --> 26:51.610
<i>we just happened upon it</i>

26:51.610 --> 26:53.133
<i>in the middle
of the open ocean?</i>

26:53.133 --> 26:55.396
They put a hole in our ship!

26:55.396 --> 26:57.354
I'm not letting them
do that again.

26:57.354 --> 27:00.314
<i>I want that sub
at the bottom of the ocean.</i>

27:04.753 --> 27:06.102
I have to stop him.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.451
New contact.

27:09.323 --> 27:10.367
There's the Han.

27:14.284 --> 27:17.157
Bridge, CEC.
We found the Han.

27:17.157 --> 27:19.725
CEC, Bridge. Fire at will.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.770
Fire at will.
Aye, aye, Captain.

27:23.076 --> 27:24.468
Arming torpedoes one and two.

27:24.468 --> 27:26.166
You're making a mistake.
Do you hear me?

27:26.166 --> 27:27.776
You're making a mistake.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.967
XO, what the hell?

28:03.116 --> 28:04.552
CEC, did you fire?

28:06.641 --> 28:08.991
We've gotta get back online!

28:08.991 --> 28:10.558
Negative, Captain.

28:10.558 --> 28:12.342
<i>And whatever just happened
knocked sonar offline.</i>

28:12.342 --> 28:13.953
<i>We lost them, sir.</i>

28:16.607 --> 28:20.176
Master Chief, confine the XO
to his quarters immediately!

28:24.311 --> 28:25.921
Petty Officer.

28:30.621 --> 28:32.580
You're going to Leavenworth,
Mr. Augustine.

28:33.973 --> 28:37.280
CEC, I want to know the minute
you find that Han.

28:39.152 --> 28:42.329
Ben, Ziggy says if Drake
fires on the Chinese...

28:45.506 --> 28:47.726
That we go to war.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.996
How's it looking?

28:56.996 --> 28:58.606
Remember before
when we were worried that

28:58.606 --> 29:00.739
at the end of this leap,
Addison might have changed?

29:00.739 --> 29:02.653
Well, it feels like
the changes could be

29:02.653 --> 29:05.352
a bit more, um, global.

29:07.702 --> 29:10.749
I don't believe
the leaps are random.

29:10.749 --> 29:15.014
I don't believe it's all
just a roll of the dice.

29:15.014 --> 29:18.757
The moral arc of
the universe is long,

29:18.757 --> 29:21.847
but it bends toward justice.

29:21.847 --> 29:23.718
Martin Luther King.

29:23.718 --> 29:28.157
That's what I think we are,
what Quantum Leap is--

29:28.157 --> 29:32.509
part of whatever
mysterious force

29:32.509 --> 29:35.208
bends that arc for the better.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.080
I hope you're right.

29:38.080 --> 29:39.690
Because right now,
it feels like we're bending it

29:39.690 --> 29:41.518
towards World War III.

29:43.303 --> 29:44.957
We'll be able to resume our
search for the Han

29:44.957 --> 29:46.697
any minute now, Captain.
- Excellent.

29:46.697 --> 29:49.091
Sir, maybe we
should radio fleet,

29:49.091 --> 29:50.832
advise them of the situation.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.442
And break radio silence?

29:52.442 --> 29:54.314
Let the Chinese know that
one of theirs is in trouble?

29:54.314 --> 29:55.881
No, thanks, Master Chief.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.883
<i>CEC, Comms.</i>

29:57.883 --> 29:59.667
<i>We're finally getting
a clear transmission</i>

29:59.667 --> 30:00.842
<i>on that SOS.</i>

30:00.842 --> 30:02.235
<i>It's from the "Tampa," sir.</i>

30:02.235 --> 30:03.889
<i>Captain Toti says
they've surfaced</i>

30:03.889 --> 30:05.542
<i>and are taking on water.</i>

30:10.634 --> 30:12.680
Have fleet dispatch
a rescue helicopter

30:12.680 --> 30:14.508
to begin recovery
of the "Tampa's" men

30:14.508 --> 30:16.597
while we take care of that sub.

30:17.946 --> 30:20.383
Ben, a helicopter can only
rescue 10 men at a time.

30:20.383 --> 30:22.255
Ziggy says if we don't
sail there right now,

30:22.255 --> 30:24.300
only 20 men total
will be rescued.

30:24.300 --> 30:27.086
Also, you know, World War III.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.957
Captain, a helicopter
can only hold

30:28.957 --> 30:30.698
10 of the "Tampa's" crew.

30:30.698 --> 30:32.918
You heard the report.
We need to rescue them now.

30:32.918 --> 30:34.441
Thank you, Ops.

30:34.441 --> 30:36.530
We will make best possible
speed to the "Tampa"

30:36.530 --> 30:38.706
once this Han is dealt with.

30:38.706 --> 30:40.577
Ben, stop.

30:40.577 --> 30:43.711
Look, you might be persuasive
and yeah, the crew is worried.

30:43.711 --> 30:44.886
But this is the Navy.

30:44.886 --> 30:46.105
Chain of command is everything.

30:46.105 --> 30:47.889
There's only one man
on this ship

30:47.889 --> 30:49.891
who might be able to stop this.

30:54.113 --> 30:55.897
Sir, we need you right now.

30:55.897 --> 30:57.333
You have to act.

31:01.555 --> 31:02.817
Sir?

31:05.037 --> 31:07.169
My wife doesn't
love me anymore.

31:10.042 --> 31:13.610
I love her
and we both love Addie,

31:13.610 --> 31:15.569
but I just--

31:15.569 --> 31:17.484
I can't seem to let her in.

31:18.833 --> 31:20.400
She'll never leave.

31:20.400 --> 31:23.882
She'll endure it, endure me.

31:25.840 --> 31:26.928
She's still so young.

31:26.928 --> 31:28.408
It's--

31:29.931 --> 31:31.933
It's not fair.

31:31.933 --> 31:35.589
If I go, she'll be happier.

31:35.589 --> 31:37.373
And Addie--

31:38.853 --> 31:41.987
I won't pass on
the darkness that I carry.

31:41.987 --> 31:46.121
And I do carry it.

31:46.121 --> 31:48.080
There's an old hymn,

31:48.080 --> 31:51.213
"Set the walls
around your heart.

31:51.213 --> 31:53.912
"Build them strong with stone.

31:53.912 --> 31:56.392
And do what must be done."

31:58.699 --> 32:01.267
He used to say that to me
when I was a kid.

32:01.267 --> 32:03.486
I was really scared.

32:06.011 --> 32:09.362
"Do what must be done."

32:09.362 --> 32:12.017
Is that about your wife
or Drake?

32:12.017 --> 32:14.193
You've done everything right.

32:14.193 --> 32:17.370
You've supported him,
protected him.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.677
But now you just have
to save him from himself.

32:20.677 --> 32:25.117
It's mutiny
if I force him out.

32:25.117 --> 32:27.336
There's no way to dress it up,

32:27.336 --> 32:29.077
no way to make it look pretty.

32:29.077 --> 32:31.427
No, no.
But it's also the only way

32:31.427 --> 32:34.474
to save the lives of everyone
on board this ship.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.306
If I asked you
a really dumb question,

32:40.306 --> 32:42.134
would that distract you?

32:43.439 --> 32:45.050
Sorry, Carl.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.622
- Stop!
- Run!

32:58.715 --> 32:59.978
Huh.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.283
Well, I'm impressed.

33:01.283 --> 33:03.285
Commander Rossi, stop!

33:07.724 --> 33:08.943
Whoa. Whoa.

33:25.742 --> 33:28.049
Lieutenant Commander,
align the torpedo launchers.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.181
Standby to fire.

33:29.181 --> 33:31.009
Aye, aye, sir.

33:31.009 --> 33:32.967
You can't do this, Bill.

33:33.924 --> 33:36.188
Master Chief,
call the Master at Arms now.

33:36.188 --> 33:37.406
This is not right.

33:37.406 --> 33:38.842
If you just wait
for your rage to lift--

33:38.842 --> 33:40.409
Master Chief,
I gave you an order to get

33:40.409 --> 33:41.976
the Master at Arms in here.

33:41.976 --> 33:43.586
You'd see you're throwing
away more than your career.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.545
Have that man
taken into custody!

33:45.545 --> 33:47.851
You're about to get
your men killed.

33:50.376 --> 33:52.160
How dare you say that to me.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.597
You'd still be white trash
if I hadn't saved you.

33:54.597 --> 33:56.295
You think this is a joke?

33:56.295 --> 33:57.600
You think war
is some kind of a game?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.776
We have been attacked!

33:59.776 --> 34:03.258
And we will answer that attack
with the full faith of God

34:03.258 --> 34:05.608
and the might
of the United States.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.394
Tell him, Master Chief!

34:19.100 --> 34:21.581
Mr. Shaw, you know I'm right.

34:25.498 --> 34:27.369
Mr. Parker?

34:31.721 --> 34:32.809
What is wrong with you?

34:32.809 --> 34:34.681
What is wrong with all of you?

34:34.681 --> 34:37.031
Have you lost your minds
or your nerve?

34:37.031 --> 34:38.467
Which is it?

34:54.309 --> 34:55.397
I'm sorry, sir.

34:55.397 --> 34:57.312
I should have spoken up sooner.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.706
You're a legend
and an inspiration

34:59.706 --> 35:01.708
to everyone on this ship.

35:05.538 --> 35:07.496
Be that man now.

35:14.590 --> 35:19.160
Master Chief, the XO will
direct the rescue mission.

35:19.160 --> 35:20.814
And, uh--

35:24.122 --> 35:27.168
I'll be in my quarters
if you need me.

35:27.168 --> 35:28.648
Thank you, Captain.

35:29.779 --> 35:30.911
It's--

35:36.090 --> 35:37.831
<i>CEC, Comms.</i>

35:37.831 --> 35:39.833
<i>The "Tampa" reports she's down
to just a few feet</i>

35:39.833 --> 35:41.704
<i>of free board and her men
are going into the water.</i>

35:41.704 --> 35:43.402
Nav, plot
an intercept course,

35:43.402 --> 35:44.707
best possible speed.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.535
Sir, any intercept course
is gonna take us

35:46.535 --> 35:47.754
right into that minefield.

35:47.754 --> 35:49.190
How long to circumnavigate
the field?

35:49.190 --> 35:51.061
Well, at flank speed,
about three hours.

35:51.061 --> 35:52.802
Then we have
to go straight through.

35:52.802 --> 35:55.544
Ben, all Naval mines can
be remotely detonated.

35:55.544 --> 35:57.198
I can get the Chinese codes
from Ziggy.

35:57.198 --> 35:59.548
You just have to figure out
how to get them to the mines.

36:03.335 --> 36:04.684
XO?

36:06.076 --> 36:07.382
I've got an idea.

36:18.611 --> 36:19.960
<i>CEC, bridge.</i>

36:19.960 --> 36:21.918
Can I get a range and time
for the first mine.

36:21.918 --> 36:23.398
We need a range.

36:25.095 --> 36:26.793
1,500 yards.

36:28.969 --> 36:30.753
two minutes, 31 seconds.

36:32.625 --> 36:33.843
Ben?

36:36.063 --> 36:37.543
Range 1,200 yards.

36:37.543 --> 36:39.675
Ben, did you get
that frequency yet?

36:39.675 --> 36:41.242
Range 1,100 yards.

36:41.242 --> 36:42.896
Ben, don't you lie to me.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.898
I might be a hologram,
but I will kick your--

36:44.898 --> 36:46.421
Comms, CEC.

36:46.421 --> 36:49.032
Walker, I need you
to repurpose the transmitter.

36:49.032 --> 36:50.469
<i>CEC, I don't understand.</i>

36:50.469 --> 36:52.558
Who is this?
Is Walker there?

36:52.558 --> 36:53.907
Put him on fast.

36:53.907 --> 36:55.604
Commander, if you repurpose
that transmitter,

36:55.604 --> 36:57.345
are we still gonna be able
to see the mines on screen?

36:57.345 --> 36:58.477
No, we're gonna
lose your visual

36:58.477 --> 36:59.826
but we're not gonna need it.

36:59.826 --> 37:01.262
I'm converting the radar
emitters to transmitters.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.524
We're gonna blow up the mines

37:02.524 --> 37:04.004
before we even get close
to them.

37:04.004 --> 37:05.745
<i>Ops, you miss me?</i>

37:05.745 --> 37:07.268
Ah, Walker. Thank God.

37:07.268 --> 37:08.748
We need you to broadcast
the following frequency

37:08.748 --> 37:10.706
with this exact code.

37:13.883 --> 37:15.450
<i>600 yards.</i>

37:15.450 --> 37:17.887
Visual lost.

37:17.887 --> 37:18.845
Nav.

37:19.976 --> 37:21.543
500 yards.

37:23.980 --> 37:26.331
400 yards.

37:26.331 --> 37:28.507
So you double checked
his math, right?

37:28.507 --> 37:30.465
<i>300 yards.</i>

37:32.119 --> 37:33.816
<i>200 yards.</i>

37:46.176 --> 37:47.787
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

37:47.787 --> 37:49.223
Yeah!

37:49.223 --> 37:50.920
Whoo!
- Whoo!

37:50.920 --> 37:53.314
Yeah!
- All right!

37:55.185 --> 37:56.622
Yeah!

37:56.622 --> 37:58.580
Nice. Yes.

38:00.408 --> 38:02.192
- Range could have been better.
- Ah.

38:04.194 --> 38:06.066
But it got the job done.

38:10.853 --> 38:13.334
<i>Stand by.
Proceed to sailors.</i>

38:32.919 --> 38:37.010
I know you're scared
that you're gonna hurt me.

38:37.010 --> 38:41.449
And I know that you're scared
that you can't be a good dad

38:41.449 --> 38:46.802
because you're too hard
or cold,

38:46.802 --> 38:52.242
or that you carry some kind
of darkness inside of you.

38:54.462 --> 38:59.685
But whatever your dad had,
it stops with you.

39:03.428 --> 39:10.348
Because you have done nothing
but love me...

39:12.480 --> 39:15.353
And made me the person that
I am today.

39:19.052 --> 39:22.795
It is going to be okay, Dad.

39:36.112 --> 39:37.375
Yeah.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.856
Everything's gonna be okay.

39:55.044 --> 39:56.872
Ops, it's Walker.

39:56.872 --> 39:58.396
Just wanted to thank you
for saving us.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.485
Walker, thank--

40:03.096 --> 40:05.011
Martínez.

40:05.011 --> 40:06.447
I know everything about you,

40:06.447 --> 40:08.971
Dr. Ben Song
from the year 2022.

40:08.971 --> 40:10.451
That's right.

40:10.451 --> 40:11.974
Your team must have found me--

40:11.974 --> 40:13.759
well, the past me.

40:13.759 --> 40:16.936
I can't imagine I had
any intel to give to you.

40:16.936 --> 40:19.199
You helped me today?

40:19.199 --> 40:22.594
I mean, if we're being fair,
I'd say you helped me.

40:22.594 --> 40:23.812
Not sure I could have
pulled this off

40:23.812 --> 40:25.248
from where I was sitting today.

40:25.248 --> 40:28.077
I-I-I don't understand.

40:28.077 --> 40:29.470
I know.

40:29.470 --> 40:32.821
And that's why
I'm going to win.

40:39.306 --> 40:41.308
How'd I get up here?

40:41.308 --> 40:42.614
Rossi?

40:44.354 --> 40:46.400
Man, I'm totally confused.

40:47.836 --> 40:49.142
Me too.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.932
Hey, hey.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.499
You have to tell them
it wasn't my fault.

40:58.499 --> 40:59.631
I was only naked
because my girlfriend

40:59.631 --> 41:01.328
locked me out of the house.

41:10.076 --> 41:11.512
I'm a lawyer.
