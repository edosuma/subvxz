12:50.551 --> 12:53.289
-Okay. Is that a Fak?
Sounds like a Fak.
-No, it is not a Fak.

12:53.322 --> 12:54.391
It is not a Fak.

12:54.424 --> 12:56.262
It's a specialist. Aw.

12:56.295 --> 12:58.132
-Shit.
-SYDNEY: Yeah, shit.

12:58.165 --> 13:00.136
But some good news.

13:00.169 --> 13:02.374
Everybody is food certified
except for Ebra,

13:02.407 --> 13:04.011
who just needs to be renewed.

13:04.044 --> 13:07.317
And Richie, who actually
has never done it because...

13:07.350 --> 13:08.554
-Richie.
-SYDNEY: Yes.

13:08.587 --> 13:10.524
Also, I filed with the BACP

13:10.557 --> 13:12.227
for our
City of Chicago Consultant.

13:12.260 --> 13:14.164
-Right.
-SYDNEY: We need them to approve

13:14.197 --> 13:15.333
all of our
new business paperwork,

13:15.366 --> 13:18.507
and then they'll send a rep
and that rep will sign off

13:18.540 --> 13:21.445
on another rep
who will come and look at stuff

13:21.478 --> 13:23.282
and then sign off
on a, on a different rep.

13:23.315 --> 13:25.019
-How many reps is that?
-Many.

13:25.052 --> 13:26.523
A lot. A lot of reps. Yeah.

13:26.556 --> 13:28.426
But it's-it's gonna be okay,
you know.

13:28.459 --> 13:30.463
All we have to do
is just stay calm

13:30.497 --> 13:31.533
and make sure--

13:31.566 --> 13:33.002
-CARMY: Fuck.
-Sydney.

13:33.035 --> 13:34.037
-Fuck.
-MARCUS: What was that?

13:34.070 --> 13:34.905
Uh, fell through a wall.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.308
-Good morning.
-Damn, you got strong.

13:36.341 --> 13:38.179
What kind of
insurance coverage do we have

13:38.212 --> 13:40.049
for people falling
through the fuckin' wall?

13:40.082 --> 13:42.187
The really good kind
where you pray they don't.

13:42.220 --> 13:44.057
Yo! Syd, you just fu...

13:46.061 --> 13:47.030
Why'd you tear Fenway?

13:47.063 --> 13:48.332
Why did I tear Fenway?

13:48.365 --> 13:50.203
That's been there
for five years.

13:50.236 --> 13:51.439
SYDNEY:
You think I intentionally
fell through a wall?

13:51.472 --> 13:53.142
"A," fuck the Red Sox,

13:53.175 --> 13:54.579
and "B,"
what has it been hiding
for five years?

13:54.612 --> 13:56.281
"A," that's...

13:57.217 --> 13:59.589
Three, four, five.

13:59.622 --> 14:01.459
"A," that's Mikey's
favorite squad,

14:01.493 --> 14:03.362
so please show
some respect, okay?

14:03.395 --> 14:06.202
And "B," that's the result
of some failed Jewish Lightning.

14:06.235 --> 14:07.237
-Yo.
-What?

14:07.270 --> 14:08.473
What?
That's what it's called.

14:08.507 --> 14:09.375
No, we're not doing that.

14:09.408 --> 14:10.477
I'd like to add it
to the list, please.

14:10.511 --> 14:11.378
Look, I haven't said

14:11.411 --> 14:12.481
G or R in over a week.

14:12.515 --> 14:14.318
No, cousin, explain.

14:14.351 --> 14:15.487
In an effort
of personal growth,

14:15.521 --> 14:16.623
I promise not to say
gay or retarded--

14:16.657 --> 14:19.294
-No, cousin, the hole. Explain.
-You just-just said it.

14:19.327 --> 14:21.365
Jewish Lightning
is when you burn down a place.

14:21.398 --> 14:23.469
Yeah, the explanation
makes it seem worse.

14:23.503 --> 14:25.240
RICHIE: Look,
there was a time when

14:25.273 --> 14:29.080
Mikey was maybe on some shit
and he thought

14:29.715 --> 14:34.526
that if this place were
to accidentally... burn down,

14:34.559 --> 14:36.095
that maybe there'd be
some insurance money.

14:36.128 --> 14:37.130
I got it, thank you.

14:37.163 --> 14:38.266
SYDNEY: I just wanna
say that I think

14:38.299 --> 14:39.602
the explanation
of Jewish Lightning

14:39.635 --> 14:41.506
does cement it as something
that we shouldn't say.

14:42.407 --> 14:43.510
You're correct.

14:43.543 --> 14:45.112
Alright, this is salvageable.

14:45.479 --> 14:47.552
Um, Natalie, do you know
where the tape is?

14:47.585 --> 14:49.522
The tape is packed.
It's up front.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.091
-Okay?
-TINA: Jeff.

14:51.893 --> 14:54.097
-You fell through the wall?
-RICHIE: Corner.

14:54.130 --> 14:55.332
-SYDNEY: Yes. Yes.
-You okay?

14:59.407 --> 15:01.245
Okay. What was I saying?

15:01.278 --> 15:03.282
Gotta stay calm
and take it step by step.

15:03.315 --> 15:04.350
No, I know. We will.

15:04.384 --> 15:06.355
Not the first hole in a wall
I've fallen through.

15:06.388 --> 15:08.292
-No, no, that's what
you were saying.
-It is.

15:08.325 --> 15:10.196
SYDNEY: Huh? Really?

15:10.531 --> 15:11.499
Okay.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.543
(snaps fingers)
Paint in the crawlspace.

15:16.576 --> 15:18.279
That was the great idea?

15:18.312 --> 15:19.582
Yo, cousin, you do me a favor

15:19.615 --> 15:21.418
and get the paint
from the crawlspace?

15:21.451 --> 15:23.322
RICHIE:
I'm on the operating table
right now, cousin.

15:23.355 --> 15:25.160
Purpose, Chef.

15:25.193 --> 15:26.262
RICHIE: Good point, Chef.

15:26.295 --> 15:27.330
Thank you.

15:31.438 --> 15:32.541
So there's a hole in the wall.

15:33.442 --> 15:34.678
SUGAR: Yeah, I heard.

15:36.616 --> 15:38.452
Do me a favor.
Just keep thinking about it.

15:38.485 --> 15:40.524
I'll definitely
keep thinking about that hole.

15:41.092 --> 15:43.630
CARMY: No.
No, the project management.

15:45.433 --> 15:46.570
Oh.

15:46.603 --> 15:50.176
Um, timing on my side
is not great.

15:50.209 --> 15:51.278
Never is.

15:54.585 --> 15:56.154
There's not enough money.

15:56.488 --> 15:57.591
Never is.

15:59.562 --> 16:01.131
Where do you get more?

16:02.568 --> 16:05.540
(alarm blaring)

16:06.509 --> 16:07.544
Is that in my head?

16:09.447 --> 16:10.316
Ow.

16:10.349 --> 16:11.218
(blaring continues)

16:11.251 --> 16:12.153
No.

16:15.594 --> 16:17.498
-Okay.
-(blaring continues in distance)

16:17.531 --> 16:20.537
So, um, this is coming

16:20.570 --> 16:23.644
from a place of wanting
to start fresh and clean.

16:23.677 --> 16:25.280
(blaring continues)

16:25.313 --> 16:27.584
I love this place.
I love this city.

16:27.918 --> 16:30.524
I wanna start
our first business here.

16:30.557 --> 16:32.494
I want it to be a real business,

16:32.895 --> 16:36.402
an honest business
with-with-with honest partners.

16:36.435 --> 16:39.408
We wanna do high-level dining

16:39.441 --> 16:42.515
and hospitality
and-and-and beverages.

16:42.548 --> 16:44.752
And we can and we will
because we know

16:44.785 --> 16:47.357
that any good restaurant starts

16:47.390 --> 16:50.631
with dedication to service
and taking care of the customer.

16:50.664 --> 16:55.273
We drafted a quick term sheet
that specifically lays out

16:55.306 --> 16:57.310
not only
our business prospectus,

16:57.343 --> 17:00.651
but an execution guide
as well as a return portfolio.

17:00.684 --> 17:02.622
Hey, Richard, will you turn
that fucking thing off, please?

17:02.655 --> 17:03.557
-RICHIE: I'm trying.
-(blaring continues)

17:03.590 --> 17:04.592
What the fuck we doin' here?

17:04.625 --> 17:06.194
What's going on?
What are you...

17:06.529 --> 17:08.366
What are you doing?

17:08.399 --> 17:09.502
Mikey was
telling you the truth.

17:09.535 --> 17:10.571
About the-the petting zoo?

17:10.604 --> 17:11.573
What? No, no, no, no.

17:11.606 --> 17:12.508
-Mini golf?
-CARMY: No.

17:12.541 --> 17:14.478
-About franchising.
-(blaring continues)

17:14.512 --> 17:16.382
He wanted to franchise
this place.

17:16.415 --> 17:17.618
He wanted to open
a restaurant with me.

17:17.651 --> 17:18.687
How the fuck do you know?

17:18.720 --> 17:19.788
'Cause we found your money.

17:21.526 --> 17:24.698
(blaring continues)

17:31.311 --> 17:33.315
Motherfucker didn't put it
in a bank, did he?

17:34.518 --> 17:36.422
No, he-he definitely
didn't put it in a bank.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.726
CICERO:
Oh, God. Thank Christ.

17:39.695 --> 17:40.597
What is KBL?

17:40.630 --> 17:46.275
Kalinowski, me,
Berzatto, you, Layne, Lee.

17:46.308 --> 17:47.578
Lee? Who's Lee?

17:47.611 --> 17:49.481
Uncle Lee Layne.

17:49.515 --> 17:51.619
Oof. That's not our uncle.

17:51.652 --> 17:53.389
Yeah, well,
Richie's not your cousin.

17:53.422 --> 17:54.559
-RICHIE: Heard and resented.
-(blaring continues)

17:54.592 --> 17:56.462
Hey, Richie, could you
please turn that

17:56.496 --> 17:58.265
goddamn motherfuckin'
thing off?

17:58.298 --> 17:59.635
It's making me insane!

17:59.668 --> 18:00.537
How's it not makin' you insane?

18:00.570 --> 18:02.675
-I don't mind it.
-CICERO: Lucky you.

18:02.708 --> 18:04.712
I'm on it, Uncle J.
How the fuck did I know

18:04.745 --> 18:07.350
that the crawlspace
had a goddamn alarm on it?

18:07.752 --> 18:09.856
Mikey's fuckin'
Kevin McCalliper--

18:09.889 --> 18:11.860
-ALL: McCallister.
-McCallister.

18:11.893 --> 18:13.597
Yes. Hello.

18:13.630 --> 18:17.303
Uh, the password
is "gofastboatsmojito,"
all one word.

18:17.336 --> 18:20.309
Yeah. Go fast boats
and then mojito.
All one word.

18:20.342 --> 18:22.380
Okay, so just to be clear,

18:22.413 --> 18:24.551
'cause, you know,
I can't fuckin' hear correctly.

18:25.185 --> 18:27.357
Not only are you
not giving me back

18:27.390 --> 18:29.729
the original $300,000
you owe me,

18:29.762 --> 18:33.870
but you are also asking me
for an additional $500,000?

18:33.903 --> 18:36.609
-Yes, that sounds correct.
-CICERO: Okay.

18:36.642 --> 18:38.847
And so how many times
you've done this, Carm?

18:38.880 --> 18:40.483
None times.

18:40.517 --> 18:41.786
And what's
your track record, Syd?

18:41.819 --> 18:44.357
-Not great.
-Cool. I'm in.

18:44.390 --> 18:47.598
Okay, you are first out
with a bonkers interest rate

18:47.631 --> 18:50.303
because, well,
we have no choice.

18:50.336 --> 18:53.409
And you'd also be
entitled to a partnership.

18:53.442 --> 18:54.812
Partnership of what,
my love?

18:54.845 --> 18:57.918
Hey, you throw a rock,
you hit five great restaurants.

18:57.951 --> 18:59.521
We're going to be better.

18:59.822 --> 19:03.462
Um, this is going to be
a destination spot.

19:03.496 --> 19:05.433
This is going to be
an excellent restaurant.

19:05.466 --> 19:06.803
And I know that because
we're going to get a star.

19:06.836 --> 19:07.771
-Syd.
-Carm.

19:07.805 --> 19:10.376
-Fuck stars.
-Okay, well, you can say that

19:10.409 --> 19:11.344
because you already got one.

19:11.378 --> 19:12.882
No, no, no, I never got one.
I retained it.

19:12.915 --> 19:14.786
That's basically a cousin
of getting one.

19:14.819 --> 19:16.689
-Okay, kids.
-CARMY: It's not getting one,
it's retaining one.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.325
Somebody else got it,
I retained it.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.363
-SUGAR: Guys.
-You kinda got one, though.

19:20.396 --> 19:21.866
-What do you mean?
-SUGAR: They're being funny.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.369
SYDNEY: Let's get a star.

19:23.402 --> 19:24.572
-(blaring stops)
-Oh, thank fucking God.

19:24.605 --> 19:26.576
-Thank fuck.
-RICHIE: Yeah, bitch.

19:26.609 --> 19:29.916
Okay, so you get a star.
Now what?

19:29.949 --> 19:31.552
-We're dialed.
-My trapped.

19:32.821 --> 19:35.494
My friends,
can I tell you a story

19:35.527 --> 19:36.930
about complete
and utter failure?

19:36.963 --> 19:38.633
Look, we don't pay you back

19:38.666 --> 19:41.405
by the end of 18 months,
and it is yours.

19:41.438 --> 19:42.708
-What's mine?
-CARMY: All of it.

19:42.741 --> 19:43.977
The building and the lot.

19:44.010 --> 19:45.514
-Well, Carm.
-Yeah, Carm.

19:45.547 --> 19:46.682
What do you think?

19:48.452 --> 19:49.622
I don't know
what the fuck I'm thinkin'.

19:49.655 --> 19:51.559
-Tell me more.
-You can get
five million for this lot.

19:51.592 --> 19:52.528
Two maybe.

19:52.561 --> 19:53.797
-Your math is--
-Fucked.

19:53.830 --> 19:55.466
-Yeah. Not good.
-Okay.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.538
Look, we don't pay you
the money

19:57.571 --> 19:59.809
by the end of 18 months,
worst-case scenario,

19:59.842 --> 20:02.413
you helped out your nephew,
he blew it.

20:02.446 --> 20:04.852
You're out 800 grand,
and you can make two million.

20:04.885 --> 20:07.724
And then we are done forever.

20:09.427 --> 20:11.900
Jimmy, I wasn't gonna
tell you about the money,

20:11.933 --> 20:13.870
but we need more, okay?

20:13.903 --> 20:16.776
And we need a partner,
and that is the truth.

20:19.515 --> 20:20.617
What do you say?

20:34.545 --> 20:35.947
How long'd it take you to open?

20:37.651 --> 20:38.886
That is a great question.

20:39.320 --> 20:40.790
CICERO: Well, you know...

20:41.191 --> 20:42.994
great partners
ask great questions.

20:44.565 --> 20:46.769
(exciting music playing)

20:46.802 --> 20:47.737
Okay.

20:48.739 --> 20:52.648
Alright, Fak, Gary
on construction and demo.

20:52.681 --> 20:53.984
-Syd, we're on menu?
-SYDNEY: Yes, Chef.

20:54.017 --> 20:55.888
SUGAR:
With Jimmy's injection,
it's gonna take

20:55.921 --> 20:57.758
at least eight months
to get into profit,

20:57.791 --> 21:00.898
which, to put it generously,
is tight,

21:00.931 --> 21:02.868
given it's gonna take
six months to open.

21:02.901 --> 21:04.539
-Six months?
-Six months?

21:04.572 --> 21:05.874
Yeah, at least.

21:05.907 --> 21:06.876
And that's being...

21:06.909 --> 21:07.945
-What, confident?
-Cocky.

21:07.978 --> 21:10.951
Crazy. You guys. Crazy.

21:10.984 --> 21:13.657
Dude, um, we have 18 months
to pay back that loan.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.794
Uh, is there anything we can do?
I mean...

21:15.827 --> 21:18.633
Dude, you are the one
that said 18 months.

21:18.666 --> 21:20.571
-That's a CP.
-CARMY: What's a CP?

21:20.604 --> 21:21.706
-Carmy Problem.
-A Carmy Problem.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.677
-Great.
-Six months is gonna kill us.

21:23.710 --> 21:25.914
Yeah. No, we're gonna have
to be rockin' from the jump.

21:25.947 --> 21:27.083
Just fuckin' packed right out.

21:27.116 --> 21:28.920
And you want a, uh, star.

21:28.953 --> 21:30.657
I think it'd be nice. Yeah.

21:30.690 --> 21:31.926
-Godspeed.
-Thank you.

21:31.959 --> 21:33.763
-CARMY: Start looking into crew?
-Yeah.

21:33.796 --> 21:34.899
Natalie, do you work here?

21:34.932 --> 21:36.468
I'm still thinking.

21:36.502 --> 21:37.905
I have one person
still thinking, Chef.

21:37.938 --> 21:39.876
-CARMY: Tremendous.
-Thank you.

21:39.909 --> 21:41.478
Alright, okay,
we're gonna have to

21:41.512 --> 21:43.015
find people that want to learn,

21:43.048 --> 21:44.852
which is gonna be impossible.

21:44.885 --> 21:46.522
But, you know,
it's even more difficult

21:46.555 --> 21:48.025
to teach people
how to give a shit, so.

21:48.058 --> 21:49.662
TINA:
Good night. Jeffs.

21:49.695 --> 21:50.797
-Bye, T.
-Good night.

21:50.830 --> 21:53.536
TINA:
Okay. Oh, and Sydney,

21:53.569 --> 21:55.607
I got a bunch
of those stains out.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.043

21:57.076 --> 21:58.847
Science, baby.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.819
Yeah, okay, I'll see you all
bright and early tomorrow.

22:01.852 --> 22:02.855
CARMY:
Yep. Night, Chef.

22:02.888 --> 22:03.857
-SUGAR: Bye.
-Night.

22:03.890 --> 22:06.596
(door opens, closes)

22:06.629 --> 22:07.697
Tina.

22:10.837 --> 22:12.508
Tina? Tina, hey.

22:12.541 --> 22:13.743
-Sorry, uh...
-What's up?

22:13.776 --> 22:14.978
I wanted to...

22:15.012 --> 22:17.518
I wanted to ask you something,
and-and you can totally say no.

22:17.551 --> 22:19.922
-It might be completely insane.
-I could stay later.

22:19.955 --> 22:22.093
-It's just there wasn't
that much left to do.
-No, no, go home, obviously.

22:22.126 --> 22:25.567
Go home. It's-it's more...
I wanted to ask you...

22:25.600 --> 22:28.138
Uh, yeah.
If you-- obviously
feel free to say no,

22:28.171 --> 22:29.842
this is probably insane.

22:29.875 --> 22:32.113
And it would just require
a lot of training.

22:32.146 --> 22:34.552
And, I mean,
like a lot of training,

22:34.585 --> 22:36.923
like, more than you've
probably ever done before.

22:36.956 --> 22:37.992
And you also know this place.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.094
I mean,
it's a fucking hell hole.

22:39.127 --> 22:40.998
And why would you
wanna be here?

22:41.031 --> 22:43.102
But, um, yeah,
it was just about earlier.

22:43.135 --> 22:44.872
If you, you know,
you were talking about

22:44.905 --> 22:45.874
the new sous and I guess--

22:45.907 --> 22:47.143
Oh, yeah, I can ask around.

22:47.176 --> 22:48.613
I just don't know
anybody off the top--

22:48.646 --> 22:49.582
No, no, no.

22:49.615 --> 22:50.984
T... Tina, I'm asking you

22:51.017 --> 22:53.623
if you would,
um, be interested

22:53.656 --> 22:56.996
in learning how to be my sous.

22:59.033 --> 23:01.639
Yeah, if you... I guess...

23:01.672 --> 23:04.578
I don't know.
if you wanna be
my Jeff or whatever.

23:13.930 --> 23:15.533
(Tina laughs)

23:16.769 --> 23:18.138
Oh, fuck. Oh, Christ.

23:18.171 --> 23:20.944

-Yes. Yes. Yes.

23:20.977 --> 23:22.080

You're very, very strong.

23:22.113 --> 23:23.916
-I am.
-That's cool.

23:24.250 --> 23:25.954
-Great. Okay.
-TINA: Okay.

23:25.987 --> 23:27.624
Um, yeah, go home, though.

23:27.657 --> 23:28.324
-TINA: Okay.
-Yeah.

23:28.358 --> 23:30.029
But I'll talk to you tomorrow.

23:30.062 --> 23:31.198
-Tomorrow?
-SYDNEY: Yeah.

23:31.231 --> 23:33.102
-Yes, Jeff.

She'll watch it later.

24:06.836 --> 24:07.871

24:07.905 --> 24:11.078
Don't think I've ever heard it
be quiet in here.
