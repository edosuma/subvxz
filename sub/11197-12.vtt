00:06.240 --> 00:09.040
Previously on ''Stargate SG-1'';

00:09.120 --> 00:11.680
Reese, your father made you wrong

00:11.800 --> 00:13.840
- No
- Yes

00:17.400 --> 00:20.000
lf, as you say,
this android was responsible

00:20.120 --> 00:24.240
for creating the first generation of
replicators, it may well prove invaluable.

00:27.120 --> 00:31.840
Their radar is incomplete. Fly through the
lower bay. They'll never see you comin'

00:37.520 --> 00:40.400
l have no idea where we are.
l can't plot a course for home.

00:40.760 --> 00:43.120
lt's the Asgard.

00:44.880 --> 00:47.600
- Can you help us out here?
- lt is we who need your help.

00:47.720 --> 00:51.320
The Asgard home world
has been overrun by the replicators.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.000
- Are you serious?
- Very.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.360
- This brand-new ship you need...
- Yes.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.800
So new it doesn't have a name yet.
lt's not even finished.

01:06.920 --> 01:10.000
l think that's the point, sir.
The more low-tech the better.

01:10.120 --> 01:11.520
Correct, Major Carter.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.480
lt certainly defies conventional wisdom.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.000
Mine too.

01:17.080 --> 01:22.480
The replicators will not wish to integrate
such inferior technology into their own.

01:23.080 --> 01:25.520
Then... what?

01:25.640 --> 01:28.560
A task for which you are uniquely suited.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.000
- You need someone dumb enough.
- On the contrary.

01:32.080 --> 01:36.480
lt is both your physical prowess
and military expertise that are required.

01:36.560 --> 01:41.400
Flattery goes a long way with me, but if
you're goin' where l think you're goin'...

01:41.520 --> 01:44.000
When it became clear
to the Asgard High Council

01:44.120 --> 01:46.960
that the war with the replicators
could not be won,

01:47.040 --> 01:50.320
a plan was devised, a trap was set.

01:50.680 --> 01:54.280
- One made possible by you.
- By us?

01:54.400 --> 01:58.480
The android Reese that you discovered
and provided to us for study

01:58.560 --> 02:01.520
retained a single core command
in her base programming

02:01.600 --> 02:05.120
which we believed all replicators
would still follow.

02:05.240 --> 02:08.000
- Then you were able to reactivate her?
- No.

02:08.080 --> 02:10.479
The android was damaged beyond repair.

02:10.600 --> 02:15.040
However, the key command was activated
within her neural network,

02:15.120 --> 02:19.760
amplified and broadcast through
subspace throughout the known universe.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.440
- What was the command?
- To come forth.

02:24.920 --> 02:27.760
You instructed every replicator
to come to you?

02:27.840 --> 02:30.080
l have a theory why you lost the war.

02:30.160 --> 02:33.360
The command was only given
once the trap was set.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.760
- What was the trap?
- A time-dilation device,

02:36.840 --> 02:40.760
generating a field radius
of 0.16 light years.

02:40.840 --> 02:43.360
Wow. That's some trap.

02:45.440 --> 02:47.800
They created a bubble
around the replicators,

02:47.920 --> 02:50.640
within which time was
slowed down by a factor of...

02:50.720 --> 02:53.920
- 10 to the fourth power.
- Relatively speaking, sir,

02:54.040 --> 02:57.720
one year to the replicators would be
about 10,000 years to the rest of us.

02:57.840 --> 03:00.160
An hour would be over a year.
A day would be...

03:00.280 --> 03:01.760
l get it.

03:01.840 --> 03:04.160
The point is, if the plan had worked,

03:04.280 --> 03:07.360
it would have bottled
the replicators up in one place

03:07.480 --> 03:10.240
and bought the Asgard many years
to solve the problem.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.720
No. The point is, it didn't work.

03:12.840 --> 03:16.520
O'Neill is correct. Our plan failed.

03:17.120 --> 03:19.680
- What went wrong?
- We do not know.

03:19.760 --> 03:24.640
The time-dilation device was constructed
within a very old structure on Hala,

03:24.760 --> 03:27.600
the first planet settled by the Asgard.

03:27.720 --> 03:31.520
The device was encased
in a solid neutronium shell,

03:31.640 --> 03:35.920
and set with a time delay sufficient
to evacuate our entire civilisation.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.840
However strong neutronium is,
wouldn't the replicators eat through it?

03:39.960 --> 03:42.080
Eventually, yes.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.880
But not in sufficient time
before the device activated.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.600
This calculation was made
with considerable margin for error.

03:50.040 --> 03:52.880
When the time came, nothing happened.

03:52.960 --> 03:56.720
So the replicators got to the
time-dilation device before it activated.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.680
That appears to be the only explanation.

03:59.800 --> 04:02.080
So what do you want us to do?

04:02.640 --> 04:06.000
Fly your ship through
replicator-dominated space,

04:06.120 --> 04:10.240
repair whatever damage may have
been done to the time-dilation device,

04:10.320 --> 04:13.760
and activate it before
the replicators can stop you.

04:15.000 --> 04:21.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:26.200 --> 05:29.680
Thor, buddy... there's no way.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.240
The replicators will soon consume
all that they can within our home galaxy.

05:34.360 --> 05:35.920
Yours will be next.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.640
l thought we were
too primitive to consume.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.960
Your technology would not
immediately attract the replicators,

05:43.080 --> 05:47.920
but they would eventually be drawn to
the raw materials of your civilisation.

05:48.120 --> 05:50.160
Your extinction will be assured.

05:50.280 --> 05:54.560
So would every other world we've visited.
lt's just a matter of time.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.120
- Did all of the Asgard manage to escape?
- Most, but not all.

05:59.200 --> 06:01.280
A great battle was fought.

06:01.360 --> 06:05.360
The evacuation fleet is standing by
in the void between our two galaxies,

06:05.440 --> 06:08.320
waiting to hear word of your response.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.240
My response?

06:11.360 --> 06:14.480
We have done all that we can
and failed, O'Neill.

06:14.600 --> 06:17.600
You and your team
represent our last hope.

06:17.720 --> 06:21.040
Yeah, great. So no pressure, right?

06:21.120 --> 06:27.280
lf you have decided not to undertake
this task, l will inform the council.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.360
Just... give me a minute here, OK?

06:31.480 --> 06:33.760
Are you reconsidering, O'Neill?

06:33.840 --> 06:36.160
l'm considering reconsidering.

06:36.280 --> 06:41.280
- There has to be other options.
- We believe there is no alternative plan.

06:41.760 --> 06:45.440
Thor, l don't think you realise
what you're asking us to do.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.560
ln the past, your projectile weapons
have been most effective.

06:49.680 --> 06:52.240
We don't have any
projectile weapons with us,

06:52.320 --> 06:55.360
and according to Carter
we're a long way from...

07:01.280 --> 07:03.200
home.

07:03.280 --> 07:06.400
- You towed us back into Earth's orbit.
- Correct, Major Carter.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.920
The contents of your armoury
at Stargate Command,

07:09.040 --> 07:12.960
along with appropriate attire, food
and other supplies you may require

07:13.080 --> 07:15.440
are now being transported
aboard this vessel.

07:15.520 --> 07:19.120
- l hope you did the paperwork.
- We have a few passengers.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.480
They are being transported
to Stargate Command.

07:22.560 --> 07:26.480
- l haven't said yes yet.
- But you are reconsidering.

07:28.160 --> 07:34.240
l'm... leaning in the general direction.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.560
Hey, what are you doin'?

07:41.680 --> 07:44.480
We're leaving the solar system.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.720
Thor... little fella,
that's not the way it works.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.400
lt's not my ship.
lt's not up to me.

07:52.520 --> 07:57.280
The journey to our home galaxy will take
many hours with your vessel in tow.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.920
You may consult your superiors en route.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.160
(alarm)

08:04.840 --> 08:06.800
- Sergeant?
- l can't explain it, sir.

08:06.920 --> 08:12.160
Everything in the armoury disappeared -
P90s, SPAS-12s, Claymores, everything.

08:13.040 --> 08:18.160
Sir, four people who commandeered the
X-303 just appeared in the holding room.

08:18.840 --> 08:23.600
Air-force personnel and a reporter just
beamed into the kitchen up on level 22.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.680
Food stores went missing
at the same time.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.800
- You're sure the Stargate's been inactive?
- Yes, sir.

08:28.920 --> 08:31.120
What in God's name is happening?

08:33.799 --> 08:36.159
Hello, sir. Siler.

08:36.280 --> 08:39.080
Colonel, it's good
to see you alive and well.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.919
We were concerned the X-303
was lost with all hands.

08:42.039 --> 08:46.640
No, sir, we're all fine. Except for
the Goa'uld and Simmons, of course.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.720
So you were rescued by the Asgard.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.840
Actually, it looks like
we're coming to their rescue, sir.

08:51.920 --> 08:56.080
ls that why supplies and equipment
are disappearing from all over my base?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.520
Yes, sir.

08:57.640 --> 09:01.280
You might wanna get upstairs
and punch one on the old speed dial.

09:01.880 --> 09:05.200
- My grandchildren?
- Two, then.

09:05.320 --> 09:09.200
The president might wanna know what
the Asgard have in mind for our new ship.

09:14.120 --> 09:17.120
- They didn't go for it.
- They didn't approve the mission?

09:17.240 --> 09:22.160
No, they did that. Once they knew
the whole fate-of-the-universe stuff,

09:22.240 --> 09:24.880
the president and Hammond
realised we had no choice.

09:24.960 --> 09:28.960
He sends good luck, and all those things
he says when he thinks we're gonna die.

09:29.080 --> 09:31.840
- So what didn't they go for?
- The name l suggested.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.640
- For the ship?
- Yeah.

09:33.760 --> 09:37.280
Sir, we can't call it the Enterprise.

09:37.400 --> 09:39.920
Why not?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.800
The project code name is Prometheus.
What about that?

09:42.880 --> 09:45.920
lt's a Greek tragedy.
Who wants that?

09:46.000 --> 09:48.480
OK, the X-303 it is, then.

09:48.600 --> 09:51.080
Yeah. What have you got there?

09:51.200 --> 09:56.000
The Asgard surmised that the replicators
probably disabled the time-dilation device

09:56.080 --> 09:59.440
by destroying
the control-interface mechanism.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.480
Uh-huh?

10:00.600 --> 10:03.360
lt's really not much more
than an advanced timer,

10:03.480 --> 10:07.600
but since Asgard technology would cause
the replicators to swarm all over us,

10:07.680 --> 10:11.040
Thor had a copy of the interface built
from Earth-based materials.

10:11.120 --> 10:16.240
lt'll work just as well as the original,
but it shouldn't attract the replicators.

10:18.080 --> 10:21.040
- l'm hungry.
- Cargo bay three, sir.

10:21.120 --> 10:22.480
Thanks.

10:31.920 --> 10:35.200
You guys trying to make yourselves sick?

10:35.280 --> 10:38.200
Well, Thor forgot about
the need for refrigeration,

10:38.320 --> 10:41.280
so we figured we'd start
with the frozen stuff.

10:41.360 --> 10:43.520
That is good. Mmm...

10:44.680 --> 10:46.640
l'll buy that.

10:53.640 --> 10:57.120
So, Jonas, first time
goin' up against a replicator, eh?

10:57.280 --> 10:58.800
Mm-hm.

10:58.880 --> 11:02.320
l think l have a pretty good idea
what to expect though.

11:02.400 --> 11:07.040
Teal'c told me all about 'em
and l read everything Dr Jackson wrote.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.560
They're fascinating.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.840
- Fascinating?
- Yeah.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.840
Well, think about it. A human scientist
creates this android girl,

11:15.960 --> 11:19.720
who then goes on to create
these replicators as a toy.

11:19.840 --> 11:24.240
Well, the concept of something that starts
out so innocent and becomes so evil,

11:24.320 --> 11:26.320
that's gotta be fascinating to you.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.160
Replicators exist to increase their
numbers and do so without prejudice.

11:30.240 --> 11:33.040
They are no more evil than a virus.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.040
A really evil virus.

11:35.120 --> 11:39.600
We can all agree that any living thing
that isn't inherently evil in and of itself

11:39.720 --> 11:42.640
is capable of undertaking
actions that are evil.

11:43.560 --> 11:47.120
- We are slowing.
- (Carter) You should come forward, sir.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.800
We're on our way.

11:55.160 --> 11:57.200
We came out of hyperspace a minute ago.

11:57.280 --> 12:01.120
We dare proceed no further
without risk of engaging the replicators.

12:01.200 --> 12:04.400
You will have to continue from here
under your own ship's power.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.360
- But you'll wait here for us?
- There is another concern.

12:07.440 --> 12:12.080
Our sensors have discovered that the
time-dilation device was indeed activated.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.800
Well, that's good.

12:15.840 --> 12:16.880
lt's not good?

12:17.000 --> 12:20.240
Time is now progressing faster
within the field.

12:20.320 --> 12:23.280
- They reversed it?
- By a factor of 10 squared.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.360
What is with you people?

12:25.440 --> 12:28.560
Time machines are nothin' but trouble.
Even we know that.

12:28.640 --> 12:33.840
Clearly, the replicators have utilised
the machine to serve their own purpose.

12:33.960 --> 12:36.720
But what would that purpose be?

12:36.840 --> 12:39.760
Well, l gotta tell you, this changes things.

12:42.080 --> 12:46.720
- Carter, how does this change things?
- l don't know, sir. l guess it doesn't.

12:46.840 --> 12:49.040
We got the same problem
we had an hour ago?

12:49.120 --> 12:52.800
Well, in that hour, four days
have passed for the replicators.

12:52.880 --> 12:56.400
Depending on when they did this,
they may have experienced centuries.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.880
- l get it.
- lf you wish to reconsider...

12:59.000 --> 13:00.800
No, no.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.840
l full well expected
the other shoe to drop eventually.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.360
We can only hope that
this will be the last footwear to fall.

13:07.440 --> 13:12.240
The coordinates to the planet have been
entered into your navigational computer.

13:12.320 --> 13:16.480
We have modified your engines
and structural integrity fields

13:16.600 --> 13:18.880
to assure your safe arrival.

13:18.960 --> 13:23.040
We will monitor your progress
as best we can. Good luck.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.080
Setting course
to programmed coordinates.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.640
Throttling up sublight engines.

13:55.280 --> 13:56.960
Again.

13:57.040 --> 14:01.280
lf my hands are covered in blisters,
they're not gonna work any faster.

14:01.360 --> 14:04.400
Colonel, we're about to enter
the time-dilation field.

14:04.480 --> 14:06.640
We're on our way.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.800
A replicator-controlled vessel approaches.

14:14.920 --> 14:18.640
Hopefully they'll agree with Thor
and think this ship's a piece of junk.

14:18.760 --> 14:20.960
They are scanning us.

14:24.480 --> 14:28.720
(Carter) Sir, we're being scanned
by the replicator ship. Stand by.

14:29.800 --> 14:32.160
Are we still in business?

14:36.480 --> 14:38.560
lndeed.

14:38.640 --> 14:42.960
Yes, sir. lt's moving off. We're clear
to enter the planet's atmosphere.

14:55.880 --> 14:59.760
We're detecting one structure
at the designated coordinates.

14:59.840 --> 15:01.840
Just the one?

15:01.920 --> 15:05.200
There appears to be
little topography of any kind.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.720
- 200 metres.
- Throttling down to 50 per cent.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.040
1-5-0 metres.

15:39.160 --> 15:42.080
The surface appears to be
completely smooth.

15:42.640 --> 15:46.080
- 100 metres.
- No sign of replicators.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.280
Deceleration thrusters are firing.

15:50.840 --> 15:52.320
5-0 metres.

15:52.400 --> 15:55.760
lnertial compensators and
structural integrity are at maximum.

15:55.840 --> 15:58.200
Landing struts are at full extension.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.400
- What was that?
- Lightning, sir.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.640
All systems are still go.

16:08.000 --> 16:10.000
10 metres.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.760
Five metres.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.400
Touchdown

16:30.320 --> 16:32.320
Shutting down thrusters.

16:47.720 --> 16:51.600
Get a message to Thor.
Let him know we touched down.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.360
Let's move out.

17:06.160 --> 17:10.079
(Jonas) This can't be the only structure
on the entire planet.

17:10.200 --> 17:13.319
l'd be willing to bet
the bugs ate everything else.

17:14.640 --> 17:16.880
Then where are they?

17:21.119 --> 17:23.680
Sir, you're not gonna like this.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.440
What is it?

17:25.560 --> 17:28.640
This planet's surface is covered
by replicator blocks.

17:28.760 --> 17:33.040
Probably more than one layer, and who
knows how thick it is? Maybe miles.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.120
Why would that be?

17:35.200 --> 17:38.320
Well, it could be a by-product
of the reverse time dilation.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.440
They've been here hundreds of years,

17:40.520 --> 17:43.920
but there's nothing left to consume,
so they're conserving energy.

17:44.000 --> 17:47.120
- What's keeping them here?
- Who cares?

17:47.240 --> 17:49.600
Watch your step.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.440
Sir, the original interface is still intact.
l might be able to...

19:17.560 --> 19:19.800
(footsteps)

19:23.600 --> 19:28.400
- Who are you?
- Colonel Jack O'Neill, US Air Force, Earth.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.920
- Who are you?
- The others are coming.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.440
What do you think you're doing?

20:00.560 --> 20:05.560
The clocks are runnin' a little fast here.
We thought we'd stop by, wind 'em.

20:06.520 --> 20:07.840
We'll be on our way.

20:07.960 --> 20:12.680
Your companion is attempting to alter
the settings on the time device.

20:12.800 --> 20:16.480
lf she does not stop immediately,
we will be forced to take action.

20:16.600 --> 20:20.720
Well, if you do that, we might
be forced to take our own action.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.200
Tell your companion to stop.

20:24.000 --> 20:28.480
- Carter, how much time do you need?
- A lot, sir. Maybe a few hours.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.240
Hours?

20:30.360 --> 20:35.280
Sir, the interface was completely rebuilt.
l'm not even sure where to start.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.240
Couldn't you crank it up a bit,
move things along?

20:38.320 --> 20:42.160
- lt doesn't work that way, sir.
- (man chuckles)

20:42.720 --> 20:45.680
- lronic, isn't it?
- Who are you people?

20:45.800 --> 20:50.400
Because, if you haven't noticed,
the entire planet is paved with replicators.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.000
We are aware of this.

20:52.080 --> 20:55.360
Then you should also know that
they have taken millions of lives,

20:55.440 --> 20:58.160
and they'll keep on doin' that
unless we stop them.

20:58.240 --> 21:01.080
- He doesn't understand.
- He's standing right here.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.800
We cannot allow you
to stop them, l'm afraid.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.320
Why not?

21:06.400 --> 21:09.080
We are replicators.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.120
Ah.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.280
(metallic whirring)

21:46.880 --> 21:49.680
Tell your companion
to step away from the device.

21:51.480 --> 21:53.440
Carter.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.320
Your projectile weapons.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.520
l think we'll hang on to those for a while.

22:16.040 --> 22:18.400
Now there is no need.

22:36.960 --> 22:39.200
Where are my manners?

22:39.320 --> 22:42.560
This is something of an occasion,
after all, isn't it?

22:42.680 --> 22:45.200
Our first meeting.

22:47.480 --> 22:49.680
Welcome.

22:50.840 --> 22:56.480
Colonel, if we really intended you harm,
do you believe you'd be standing there?

22:58.640 --> 23:02.400
As l said... welcome.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.800
Agh

23:26.560 --> 23:29.040
We are inside your unconscious mind.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.560
You'd think there'd be more lights on.

23:34.640 --> 23:36.880
This place must be important to you.

23:38.920 --> 23:40.640
l work here.

23:40.760 --> 23:47.200
Your iris code is 903 224 637.

23:47.520 --> 23:52.320
Wow, that's... close.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.760
Here's one for ya.
l'm thinking of an animal.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.640
l never expected
that you would amuse me.

24:06.400 --> 24:09.440
l never expected you
to put your hand in my head.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.200
Your mind is... incredible.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.400
- Well, you know...
- Such chaos.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.480
And humour.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.240
And pain.

24:24.480 --> 24:26.320
(gunshot)

24:31.000 --> 24:32.560
(gunshot)

24:33.600 --> 24:39.120
You are right to blame yourself. Your son
would be alive but for your carelessness.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.200
Don't do that again.

24:42.120 --> 24:47.200
That will be your punishment if you try to
conceal anything from me on our journey.

24:54.480 --> 24:58.080
- Where we goin'?
- To every place you have ever been.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.280
Crap

25:51.600 --> 25:53.600
Oh, Jesus...

26:02.920 --> 26:05.360
Carter.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.920
Jonas

26:10.640 --> 26:12.640
Ohh

26:18.400 --> 26:20.960
Her hand was inside my... head

26:21.080 --> 26:24.760
and it was like a...
lt was like a nightmare.

26:24.880 --> 26:27.520
l think we all had a similar experience.

26:28.880 --> 26:32.160
- l don't remember much of it.
- Nor do l.

26:34.240 --> 26:38.560
- How long were we out?
- 37 hours, sir, ship time.

26:39.000 --> 26:43.280
- Why would they bring us back here?
- Perhaps we can take advantage of this.

26:44.320 --> 26:48.880
Detonate the hyperdrive? An overload
would cause a pretty big explosion.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.480
- Big enough to be worth it?
- l honestly don't know, sir.

26:53.080 --> 26:55.200
Go.

26:56.920 --> 27:01.120
Get a message to Thor. Let him know
how massively he screwed up.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.640
Colonel.

27:06.760 --> 27:11.200
- l don't think this is gonna work.
- lf Carter says she can do it...

27:11.280 --> 27:16.000
But if explosives and weapons worked,
the Asgard would have won their war.

27:16.080 --> 27:19.040
l suppose you wanna
talk to these bug people.

27:19.160 --> 27:21.360
- Don't you?
- No.

27:22.280 --> 27:24.480
Maybe we can reason with them.

27:25.960 --> 27:30.880
- lf we blow the ship, we lose that option.
- lf we blow the ship, l won't care.

27:31.880 --> 27:35.400
Colonel, l don't think you fully appreciate
what they've become.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.480
Replicators, who look like we do.

27:38.560 --> 27:43.040
More than that. Sir, this is
a huge leap in their evolution.

27:43.160 --> 27:46.080
Jonas, they are replicators

27:50.520 --> 27:52.960
Carter? What's goin' on?

27:53.040 --> 27:55.840
Everything's fine, sir.
We were just chatting.

27:55.960 --> 27:57.360
About what?

27:57.480 --> 28:01.680
He carried us back here, sir,
one at a time,

28:01.760 --> 28:04.400
so we'd be more comfortable.

28:05.240 --> 28:07.840
- Thanks.
- lt was not difficult.

28:08.920 --> 28:12.800
- Apparently, sir, we're invited to dinner.
- At his request.

28:12.880 --> 28:14.880
- Whose?
- First.

28:14.960 --> 28:17.840
- And you are?
- l was Fifth.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.520
The others are merging with our brethren,
but will return soon.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.480
You wanna let him know
we've made other plans?

28:24.600 --> 28:29.440
Exploding your vessel would only feed
energy to the blocks on the surface.

28:31.080 --> 28:34.000
Your food stores
have been taken to the temple.

28:35.160 --> 28:37.360
When are we expected?

28:39.160 --> 28:41.120
When you become hungry.

28:49.080 --> 28:51.040
- That one's different.
- No kidding.

28:51.160 --> 28:54.760
- He comes across as almost human.
- Well, he's not.

28:55.560 --> 28:58.640
- So what do we do?
- Can we leave?

28:58.760 --> 29:02.080
The ship will fly,
but l don't know how far we'll get.

29:02.160 --> 29:05.040
Sir, if this is the next evolution
of the replicators,

29:05.120 --> 29:09.600
we should find out as much as possible
about them and report it back somehow.

29:11.800 --> 29:14.160
Anyone hungry?

29:25.880 --> 29:29.840
Colonel O'Neill, Major Carter,
Teal'c, Jonas, welcome.

29:31.040 --> 29:34.640
You'll forgive us if we don't
shake your hands this time.

29:35.800 --> 29:38.080
Please sit and replenish yourselves.

29:38.160 --> 29:40.960
Organic forms store energy
so inefficiently.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.440
Yeah.

29:45.000 --> 29:47.360
- l assume you're Sixth?
- Yes.

29:48.400 --> 29:50.400
(First) Our newest addition.

29:51.360 --> 29:54.320
You're kinda going girl, boy, girl, boy...

29:54.400 --> 29:57.280
- Sir, the entire table...
- l see that.

30:00.720 --> 30:02.720
Um...

30:03.760 --> 30:08.880
We still have some questions that we
never got to ask last time we met.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
When our replicator brethren
discovered the android Reese,

30:12.080 --> 30:14.160
they realised she was their creator.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.240
They studied her design and form

30:16.320 --> 30:19.680
and found aspects of her technology
superior to their own.

30:19.800 --> 30:23.200
Our brethren are composed
of ungainly blocks.

30:23.320 --> 30:27.360
We are composed of millions of cell units,
microscopic in comparison,

30:27.480 --> 30:29.760
that combine to create this form.

30:29.880 --> 30:33.360
- Like nanites, sir.
- l hate those things.

30:33.480 --> 30:38.880
My creation took place in the last moment
before the Asgard time device activated.

30:38.960 --> 30:42.080
There was a minuscule crack
in the neutronium shell.

30:42.160 --> 30:45.840
l could penetrate this,
where my replicator brethren could not.

30:45.960 --> 30:48.560
l managed to stop the machine
before it activated

30:48.680 --> 30:51.240
and eventually used it to suit our purpose.

30:51.920 --> 30:55.200
- Which is?
- To increase our number.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.520
That has never changed.

30:57.600 --> 31:01.600
Now, thanks to the Asgard,
we have all the time in the world.

31:01.960 --> 31:05.120
ln a few short years
we will go forth as an army.

31:06.040 --> 31:09.800
- See, we can't let you do that.
- You cannot stop us.

31:09.920 --> 31:15.200
Was it not in this way that you became
the dominant species of your worlds?

31:15.280 --> 31:17.760
ls it not a process of natural selection?

31:17.880 --> 31:19.760
The strong survive.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.360
But there's nothing
truly natural about you.

31:24.520 --> 31:28.960
You've seen into our minds. l'm quite
certain that you can all tell the difference.

31:29.040 --> 31:32.480
Of course. We are far superior.

31:33.160 --> 31:37.280
And if you could see into the mind of
an animal you would blithely feed upon,

31:37.360 --> 31:39.520
you would reach the same conclusion.

31:39.600 --> 31:44.640
lt was our kind that built your creator.
You've created yourselves in our image.

31:44.760 --> 31:47.200
No. ln the image of Reese.

31:47.320 --> 31:50.920
There was something wrong with her
programming. You all know that.

31:51.040 --> 31:56.160
The flaw in the emulation programming
was discovered during my creation.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.680
Eat.

31:57.800 --> 32:01.040
l think that flaw is kinda hangin' on there.

32:01.400 --> 32:05.520
We attempted to correct the error
in the creation of Fifth.

32:08.040 --> 32:11.360
But thus far he has proven to be far too...

32:11.440 --> 32:13.920
- Human?
- Weak.

32:15.560 --> 32:19.120
Maybe Fifth represents
what you're supposed to be.

32:20.080 --> 32:21.920
No.

32:22.040 --> 32:24.320
We won't make the same mistake again.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.560
Now... you have your answers.

32:29.160 --> 32:31.280
Eat.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.720
- Why?
- To regain your strength.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.560
- Why do you care?
- So you'll be strong enough.

32:40.160 --> 32:42.960
- For what?
- To go into your minds over and over.

32:43.960 --> 32:47.280
Could there be any other reason
we would keep you alive?

32:48.920 --> 32:50.480
Crap

32:51.320 --> 32:54.480
lt'll be far less painful if you don't resist.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.360
Stop.

33:00.440 --> 33:03.360
Why? You've learned
everything you need to know.

33:03.480 --> 33:07.440
There are four minds
to explore... at least once.

33:08.440 --> 33:12.120
And Sixth is very curious
to experience their thoughts.

33:14.120 --> 33:17.520
And you... you haven't yet
had your chance.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.520
- No.
- l insist.

33:19.640 --> 33:21.840
l want you to see the disorder, the chaos.

33:21.960 --> 33:26.960
Recognise what they are in comparison.
You need to understand what you are.

33:27.080 --> 33:30.240
Visit their memories of worlds
we will conquer.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.000
Do you understand?

33:35.040 --> 33:36.400
Yes.

33:36.520 --> 33:38.960
l won't blame you if you choose me.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.520
Carter?

33:41.640 --> 33:45.520
lt's all right, sir. Last time
l didn't remember a thing.

34:15.600 --> 34:20.320
l don't know what you're showing me,
but it's not my unconscious mind.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.760
No, Major Carter. lt is mine.

34:26.560 --> 34:30.960
We share much of our thought. ln this way
we are connected, even with our brethren.

34:31.080 --> 34:33.840
But this corner of my mind is mine alone.

34:35.800 --> 34:39.120
Here we can communicate without
the others knowing what is said.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.199
You're not like them.

34:41.320 --> 34:44.239
- l'm a mistake.
- No. They are.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.480
A terrible mistake.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.440
- Help us.
- l can't.

34:51.520 --> 34:55.120
You can, because you're more like us
than you're like them.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.800
The others have the same flaw
that Reese had, but you...

34:58.880 --> 35:01.680
The others would destroy me.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.360
Not if you came with us.

35:05.840 --> 35:08.280
- You would do that?
- lf you were to come with us

35:08.400 --> 35:12.480
- and the time-dilation device was reset...
- They're my brothers and sisters.

35:12.600 --> 35:16.240
The Asgard device was never designed
to destroy the replicators.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.800
For them, it would seem like a few days,

35:18.920 --> 35:22.000
but we'd have hundreds of years
to solve their flaw.

35:25.640 --> 35:28.000
What do you want me to do?

35:40.800 --> 35:42.800
Sir.

35:43.360 --> 35:45.360
Sir.

35:46.440 --> 35:48.800
Oh, that's just not right.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.080
Jonas and Teal'c?

35:53.240 --> 35:56.360
Sir, there's a way out of this,
but we'll have to trust...

35:56.480 --> 35:58.320
Major Carter.

36:05.200 --> 36:07.640
l've made the necessary adjustments.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.200
To what?

36:09.280 --> 36:12.360
The time-dilation device.
l'm coming with you.

36:14.760 --> 36:17.880
- This is what you were gonna tell me?
- Yes, sir.

36:17.960 --> 36:21.720
The others are merging with our brethren,
but they will return soon.

36:21.840 --> 36:25.920
l've reconfigured the device,
but you must enter your command code.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.880
Go.

36:33.440 --> 36:37.640
You guys head back to the ship.
Don't fire up the engines, but be ready.

36:44.760 --> 36:47.200
My code is in, sir.
l just need to set the timer.

36:47.320 --> 36:52.240
lt'll take two minutes to get to the ship
and two more for the engines to fire up.

36:52.360 --> 36:57.280
That is too long. lf l leave, the others will
know. They will return before it activates.

36:57.360 --> 37:00.320
- Then we set it off now.
- No.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.640
We would be trapped with the others.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.280
You can probably reach the ship
faster than we can.

37:06.400 --> 37:08.840
- ln a fraction of the time.
- Give us a head start.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.120
lf you reach the ship
just before we launch,

37:11.240 --> 37:14.880
your absence won't alert
the others until it's too late.

37:15.000 --> 37:19.120
So, set the timer for... five minutes.

37:22.520 --> 37:25.440
That's cutting it awfully close, sir.

37:25.560 --> 37:27.760
l know that, Major.

37:28.600 --> 37:30.360
Thank you.

37:30.480 --> 37:33.200
You won't leave without me?

37:33.320 --> 37:34.720
No.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.520
Head for the ship
in just over three minutes.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.880
Three, two, one. Mark.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.440
Timer's running.

38:13.720 --> 38:18.000
- Fire up those engines, now/
- Understood, O'Neill.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.760
- What have you done?
- Nothing.

38:27.880 --> 38:30.720
- Where are the humans?
- They went to their ship to rest.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.240
- They're trying to escape.
- No.

38:32.320 --> 38:35.040
Even as we speak,
they're preparing to leave.

38:35.120 --> 38:37.360
She promised.

38:37.480 --> 38:40.160
lt's not too late.

38:40.760 --> 38:44.400
l can read your mind.
There's time enough to stop the machine.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.120
No.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.480
- How long?
- 20 seconds before the device activates.

38:52.960 --> 38:56.360
Get this thing in the air,
or we're gonna be here a long time.

39:09.040 --> 39:11.640
- They're escaping.
- There's two minutes left.

39:11.720 --> 39:13.880
No, my son.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.000
They've made a fool of you.

39:16.440 --> 39:18.480
They won't leave me.
She promised.

39:29.800 --> 39:31.840
She promised.

39:53.840 --> 39:56.240
We are beyond the time-dilation field.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.200
Thor sends his congratulations, sir.

39:59.280 --> 40:04.560
They'll rendezvous with us once they've
determined no replicator vessels escaped.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.280
Fine.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.400
You do realise what you did?

40:16.040 --> 40:18.000
The right thing, Jonas.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.880
You used his humanity against him.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.320
His what?

40:24.400 --> 40:27.640
Jonas is right.
That's exactly what we did.

40:27.720 --> 40:30.480
He wasn't human.

40:30.600 --> 40:32.800
Get that through your heads.

40:34.240 --> 40:36.400
He could have fooled me.

40:37.480 --> 40:42.240
We all know what would have happened
if those things had gotten out.

40:42.320 --> 40:44.640
Who was gonna stop 'em?

40:47.120 --> 40:49.480
We did the right thing.

40:51.520 --> 40:54.480
- l hope you're right, sir.
- So do l.
