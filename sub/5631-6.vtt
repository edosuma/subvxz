male narrator:
In the criminal justice system,

00:09.577 --> 00:11.745
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.845 --> 00:14.348
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.448 --> 00:16.184
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.284 --> 00:17.618
are members of an elite squad

00:17.718 --> 00:19.487
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.587 --> 00:21.522
These are their stories.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.144

Belle Donne.

02:00.421 --> 02:02.823
[laughter]

02:02.923 --> 02:04.592
- Hey, Rollins, sorry I'm late.
- Hey.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.161
- And who's this
charming young man?

02:07.261 --> 02:08.462
- Sonny Carisi, ma'am.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.764
- Oh, thank you for coming.
Champagne?

02:10.864 --> 02:12.300
- Yeah, sure.
- Here you go.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.469
- You can put that over there.
- Okay.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.305
- Oh, Mom, it's still early.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.473
- But it's a special occasion,

02:19.573 --> 02:24.312
and I do so love champagne,
all those little bubbles.

02:24.412 --> 02:27.781
Don't worry, I'm gonna have
a diet cola after every glass.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.351
Promise.

02:30.451 --> 02:32.220
- 'Cause that works.

02:32.320 --> 02:35.189
- I think it is so great
that you've come here

02:35.289 --> 02:36.924
to help Amanda with the baby.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.527
- Well, I know that she wouldn't
want to miss very much work,

02:39.627 --> 02:42.563
not when there's a possibility
of that sergeant's job.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.432
- Mama.
- Well, you told me

02:44.532 --> 02:46.667
that Ms. Benson was promoted
to lieutenant,

02:46.767 --> 02:48.569
and that you were gonna--
- Amanda would be great,

02:48.669 --> 02:51.705
but the new sergeant is coming,

02:51.805 --> 02:53.541
well, tomorrow, actually.

02:53.641 --> 02:56.176
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.280
Oh. Well, maybe that's
for the best.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.882
You can focus on being a mother.

03:01.982 --> 03:03.451
- Yeah.

- Well, hello.

03:17.665 --> 03:20.601
You must be Savannah.
- Hello.

03:20.701 --> 03:21.969
Call me Anton.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.237
- Okay.

03:23.337 --> 03:24.972
- What a surprise.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.641
For once, a girl who's
prettier than her picture.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.610
- [chuckles]

03:29.710 --> 03:31.712
What are you drinking?

03:31.812 --> 03:35.849
- Oh, don't you have
a minibar in your room?

03:37.318 --> 03:38.619
- New York.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.921
Everyone's in such a rush.

03:41.021 --> 03:44.692

get...comfortable.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.080
- Hey, Amanda,

05:13.180 --> 05:15.048
your mom seemed really nice.
- Doesn't she?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.684
- Yeah. Having her here
must be a relief.

05:16.784 --> 05:18.519
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey, did you like

05:18.619 --> 05:21.321
the heated diaper wipes caddy
thing I got you?

05:21.422 --> 05:22.990
'Cause my sister,
she swears by that.

05:23.090 --> 05:26.026
- That was you?
Ah.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.764
That must be our new sergeant.

05:30.864 --> 05:33.367
- Dodds' oldest son, huh?

05:33.467 --> 05:36.103
- Wonder how he got this job.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.039
- Privilege to meet you,
Lieutenant.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.874
My father speaks
very highly of you.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.743
- You too.
We're lucky to have you.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.379
- He's got plenty of experience,
Anti-Crime, Crown Heights.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.581
- Okay, Dad.
- Before that, Special Forces.

05:47.681 --> 05:50.518
He signed up out of college,
right after 9/11.

05:50.618 --> 05:52.019
Can't tell you
how proud I am of this kid.

05:52.119 --> 05:55.456
- Yeah, thanks,
but I am new to special vics.

05:55.556 --> 05:56.857
I know I have a lot to learn.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.760
- It is--it's a whole
different world here.

05:59.860 --> 06:02.463
- Hey, Deputy Chief,
sorry to interrupt.

06:02.563 --> 06:05.098
- Detective Rollins,
meet Sergeant Dodds.

06:05.198 --> 06:06.800
- How are you?
- Hi there.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.068
- What's going on?
- Just got a call.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.737
Alessandra Bay,
she's the lead violinist

06:09.837 --> 06:11.539
for this group, Belle Donne,

06:11.639 --> 06:14.442
was assaulted in her room
last night at the Park Milano.

06:14.542 --> 06:16.076
It's all right if I meet Fin
and Carisi down there?

06:16.176 --> 06:18.679
- Aren't you on desk duty,
Detective?

06:18.779 --> 06:20.748
- Yes, sir,
but it's a four-star hotel.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.584
- Rollins, how about you
and Sergeant Dodds stay here,

06:23.684 --> 06:24.985
hold down the fort.

06:25.085 --> 06:27.455
- Better idea,
take Mike with you.

06:27.555 --> 06:31.425
- Yeah, no time
like the present.

06:31.525 --> 06:32.826
- Okay then.

06:35.463 --> 06:38.832
- Son, sink or swim.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.137
- The vic's name
is Alessandra Bay.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.906
The maid found her on the floor.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.075
Hotel security called 911.
EMTs are with her right now.

06:48.175 --> 06:49.543
- Are we pulling
security footage?

06:49.643 --> 06:51.144
- And the key card logs.
- You know what,

06:51.244 --> 06:52.880
head of security here
is an old friend of my dad's.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.182
You can tell him Mike Dodds
needs that footage ASAP.

06:55.282 --> 06:57.985
- It's taken care of.

06:59.487 --> 07:00.821
- If the vic's conscious,

07:00.921 --> 07:02.590
I can take a statement
before she goes to the ER.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.191
- It's called a disclosure.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.760
How about we talk
to her together, huh?

07:08.161 --> 07:11.799
- It was late.

07:11.899 --> 07:16.136
I heard banging
and yelling outside,

07:16.236 --> 07:18.806
and when I opened the door,

07:18.906 --> 07:20.741
he just charged in.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.711
He was just out of his mind,

07:23.811 --> 07:26.980
grabbing at me.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.682
- What happened next?

07:28.782 --> 07:33.453
- I started screaming at him
to stop.

07:33.554 --> 07:36.557
And he, uh, he covered my mouth,

07:36.657 --> 07:41.128
and he just pushed me
to the ground.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.764
God, I-I couldn't breathe.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.233
[coughing]

07:46.333 --> 07:49.503
- Let me get you some water.
- No, no, no, don't.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.471
There could be DNA.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.773
- Oh, okay.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.975
- Okay.

07:55.075 --> 07:56.844
You okay, Ms. Bay?

07:56.944 --> 07:59.613
- [crying softly]
- Okay.

07:59.713 --> 08:03.250
Can you tell me
what happened next?

08:03.283 --> 08:03.316
- He...
[sniffs]

08:06.186 --> 08:09.757
He threw me to the floor...

08:09.857 --> 08:13.894
Then he raped me,

08:13.994 --> 08:16.630
and then I passed out.

08:16.730 --> 08:19.900
- This man,
can you describe him?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.539
- Yes.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.976
Yes, I know him.

08:29.076 --> 08:32.012
It was Anton.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.915
His name is Anton Krasnikov.

08:36.183 --> 08:39.019
He's--he's touring with us.

08:39.119 --> 08:42.022
[somber music]

08:42.122 --> 08:46.794
*

08:46.894 --> 08:48.862
- Anton Krasnikov?

08:51.732 --> 08:54.768
- Yes?
- NYPD.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.203
- You got here fast.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.938
I just called 911.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.774
My flute is missing.
- Your flute?

09:00.874 --> 09:02.910
- $50,000 Miyazawa.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.845
Someone ransacked my room
while I slept.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.714
My flute is gone.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.649
- Your flute, right, right.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.585
- Tell you what, why don't you
come down to the station.

09:11.685 --> 09:14.655
We'll file a report.

09:14.755 --> 09:15.889
[door opens]

09:15.989 --> 09:17.591
- Okay, Mr. Krasnikov,

09:17.691 --> 09:20.193
we put out an APB on your lost
flute to all pawn shops.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.029
- Not lost.
Stolen.

09:22.129 --> 09:25.565
- Uh-huh. All right,
let's retrace last night.

09:25.666 --> 09:28.201
Now, you performed
with a violin group, right?

09:28.301 --> 09:30.738
- Yes, Belle Donne, at Denali.

09:30.838 --> 09:33.006
Great audience,
thunderous ovation.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.207
They love my flute here.

09:35.342 --> 09:36.209
- And you brought your flute
with you back to the hotel?

09:37.077 --> 09:37.811
- Of course I did,
straight to my room.

09:38.478 --> 09:39.246
- What happened after that?

09:39.346 --> 09:41.114
- Went to the bar
for a nightcap.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.683
- With the ladies
you performed with.

09:42.783 --> 09:43.917
They stay in the same hotel?

09:44.017 --> 09:45.018
- Yes,

09:45.118 --> 09:46.954
but they stick to themselves.

09:47.054 --> 09:50.323
I met a--a fan.

09:51.659 --> 09:54.094
- Fan.
Fan got a name?

09:54.194 --> 09:57.164
- Uh, Savannah, maybe.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.199
- Did Savannah come up
to your room?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.971
- Listen,
I'm a happily married man.

10:04.071 --> 10:07.040
Please, don't write
this part down.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.009
She came up for one more drink.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.878
- Okay, we get it.

10:10.978 --> 10:13.146
- Okay, what happened next?

10:13.246 --> 10:16.650
- We had our drink
from the minibar.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.919
With the jet lag,
I must have fallen asleep.

10:19.019 --> 10:20.087
I woke up.
She was gone.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.655
So was my flute.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.256
- And you stayed
in your room all night?

10:23.356 --> 10:26.059
You didn't see any women
from the quartet?

10:26.159 --> 10:29.196
- No, and I'm not sure what
bearing this has on the matter.

10:29.296 --> 10:31.665
- Not even Alessandra Bay?

10:31.765 --> 10:34.367
- Not even her. Why,
did someone take her violin?

10:34.467 --> 10:37.337
- She was assaulted.
- Oh, my God. What happened?

10:37.437 --> 10:40.007
- We think
you know what happened.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.842
- What do you mean?

10:41.942 --> 10:45.145
- Well, she told us that you
were the one who attacked her.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.247
- That's ridiculous.
She's on a different floor.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.282
- Oh, you know what floor
she was on?

10:49.382 --> 10:50.650
- Well, we checked in together.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.219
- You didn't come back together?

10:52.319 --> 10:53.787
You didn't go into her room
and rape her?

10:53.887 --> 10:55.889
- Rape her?
That's impossible.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.391
Why would someone
like me need to rape anyone?

10:58.491 --> 11:00.060
Do you know who I am?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.229
I have 200 performances
booked around the world

11:02.329 --> 11:04.197
in the next year.
I would never jeopardize that.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.366
- I see.
He's a celebrity.

11:06.466 --> 11:08.268
How could he possibly
rape anyone?

11:08.368 --> 11:09.903
- The guy is

11:10.003 --> 11:13.006
an internationally-renowned
flautist.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.008
I mean, he was honored
by the King of Sweden.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.110
He's an ambassador
for UN charities.

11:17.210 --> 11:19.312
He's got no record,
impeccable reputation.

11:19.412 --> 11:21.148
- Rollins, do you remember
your first case here?

11:21.248 --> 11:23.083
It was the Italian diplomat.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.253
- He just-- I think if he were
guilty, he'd be more guarded.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.989
Just his whole affect doesn't
exactly match the profile.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.357
- He may not fit the profile,

11:30.457 --> 11:32.192
but that is his naked,
Russian ass

11:32.292 --> 11:34.828
pounding on Alessandra's door
at 2:30 in the morning.

11:34.928 --> 11:36.229
He stays 15 minutes,

11:36.329 --> 11:38.065
then he wanders back out again,
out of breath,

11:38.165 --> 11:40.067
still naked as a jaybird.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.368
You wanna watch?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.070
- No, I'll take
your word for it.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.338
- He is completely out of it.

11:45.438 --> 11:49.943
I mean, he is walking
the halls completely naked.

11:50.043 --> 11:53.847
I know she's a victim,
but he may be too.

11:53.947 --> 11:56.083
- Okay, so we have to send him
to the hospital to get swabbed,

11:56.183 --> 11:57.985
so we'll have them do blood
and urine as well.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.920
- I'll secure the room too.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.721
CSU can check it
for drug residue.

12:01.822 --> 12:04.057
- Okay.
- And prints, maybe off a glass

12:04.157 --> 12:06.860
that she gave him 'cause we
need to figure out who this fan

12:06.960 --> 12:08.896
was that he hooked up with.
- Yeah. And, Dodds...

12:08.996 --> 12:10.230
- Yeah.
- Have your friend in security

12:10.330 --> 12:11.999
pull the footage
from Anton's floor.

12:12.099 --> 12:13.266
- On it, Lieutenant.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.068
- Anton wasn't lying
about the flute.

12:15.168 --> 12:17.004
It just showed up
in a Harlem pawn shop.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.272
- Good.
Pawn shops have cameras.

12:19.372 --> 12:21.041
Did they send any footage?
- Yeah.

12:21.141 --> 12:23.243
I'm opening the file now.

12:23.343 --> 12:26.013
- What do you got?

12:26.113 --> 12:28.348
- It's still--it's buffering.

12:28.448 --> 12:30.483
I'll try it on my laptop.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.486
[suspenseful music]

12:33.586 --> 12:41.761
*

12:43.563 --> 12:47.067
Oh, don't do this to me, Kim.

12:57.010 --> 13:00.213
- Liv said you got a hit from
that pawn shop surveillance.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.482
- No, I couldn't
open the file.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.085
- You couldn't open up the file?
You send it to TARU?

13:05.185 --> 13:06.553
- Why? Anton's good
for the assault.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.988
- No doubt.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.090
Dude couldn't
remember a thing.

13:10.190 --> 13:12.525
That girl drugged him,
played his flute,

13:12.625 --> 13:14.227
and stole his flute.

13:14.327 --> 13:18.031
- Fin, he's--
he's not a victim.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.267
- You sure there's nothing
on that video?

13:20.367 --> 13:23.203
- No, nothing.
I told you.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.306
- You okay?

13:30.643 --> 13:32.846
- I'm just a little hungry.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.347
Walk me to the break room?

13:34.447 --> 13:36.216
- Sure.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.218
Your sister?

13:38.318 --> 13:40.353
Did you know she was
in New York?

13:40.453 --> 13:42.589
- Of course not. I--
[scoffs]

13:42.689 --> 13:45.058
Son of a bitch, that's why
my mom kept talking about her,

13:45.158 --> 13:46.526
wanting us all to be together.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.328
- You gotta stay away.

13:48.428 --> 13:49.963
You know last time
she set you up.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.264
If you try to help her now,

13:51.364 --> 13:53.400
she's gonna
take you down for good,

13:53.500 --> 13:55.202
and you got to tell Liv.

13:55.302 --> 13:57.270
- I can't.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.439
Especially not
with mini-Dodds hovering around.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.541
He'd go straight
to his daddy or IAB.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.110
- They're gonna
wanna see the footage.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.378
You know I don't get in trouble.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.380
- Stall them.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.982
My mother must know
where she is.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.383
Those two have always
been thick as thieves,

14:10.483 --> 14:13.553
and I will bring Kim in myself.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.588
[tense music]

14:15.688 --> 14:17.290
- All right.

14:17.390 --> 14:20.427
*

14:20.527 --> 14:23.430
- My buddy at the hotel
said he recognized Anton's date.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.864
Working girl.
- Okay,

14:24.965 --> 14:26.499
so see if he has footage
from the bar.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.235
- Rollins is doing
facial recognition

14:28.335 --> 14:30.103
on the video from the pawn shop.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.372
- Everything okay with her?
She seemed a little off.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.640
- She hadn't had lunch.

14:33.740 --> 14:34.942
I sent her to get a bite.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.376
- What about the footage?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.378
Maybe Anton can I.D. this girl.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.947
- Well, there's some kind
of tech glitch.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.548
It shouldn't be long.

14:41.648 --> 14:43.383
- All right, in the meantime,
we know she's a hooker.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.018
If he comes clean on that,

14:45.118 --> 14:46.987
maybe it'll loosen him up.

14:47.087 --> 14:51.091
How long will the DNA take?
- Depends.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.393
You know what?

14:53.493 --> 14:56.129
Tell him we already have it.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.433
- Mom, do not lie to me.

15:00.533 --> 15:01.568
Where is Kim?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.303
- Well, honey, how would I know?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.238
- I know you've been
in touch with her.

15:05.338 --> 15:08.108
- You sound stressed, and that
can't be good for the baby.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.243
- Kim is in the city.
There's an APB out on her.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.012
She robbed a john last night.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.280
- APB? John?

15:13.380 --> 15:15.182
I mean,
what does that even mean?

15:15.282 --> 15:18.385
- It means you tell her
that she either meets me now,

15:18.485 --> 15:20.153
or the cops
are gonna take her down,

15:20.253 --> 15:21.688
and, Mama, I know
you don't want any headlines

15:21.788 --> 15:24.257
in the paper about your daughter
being a prostitute.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.393
Get her to show, okay?

15:26.493 --> 15:28.928
- Well, I'll see what I can do
to get a message to her,

15:29.029 --> 15:30.297
all right?

15:35.135 --> 15:36.403
Kim?
- Mm.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.538
- Are you in some kind
of trouble?

15:38.638 --> 15:41.274
- Oh, please, Mama.
You know Amanda.

15:41.374 --> 15:45.112
She's always putting me down,
so she can build herself up.

15:45.212 --> 15:46.513
- Well, she sounds
pretty upset.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.548
I think you're gonna
have to talk to her.

15:53.120 --> 15:54.521
- What?

15:54.621 --> 15:56.389
This is not possible.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.592
- That's not you,
Mr. Krasnikov?

15:59.692 --> 16:01.261
- I don't remember this.

16:01.361 --> 16:02.695
- Okay, when you took your fan
back to the room,

16:02.795 --> 16:04.064
you had a drink
from the minibar.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.166
Now, you remember
who poured that?

16:06.266 --> 16:08.401
- Now that you mention it,
she did.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.536
I must have been drugged.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.038
- Okay.

16:11.138 --> 16:13.106
But that is you in the picture.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.542
- It is.

16:15.642 --> 16:18.045
But--but rape?

16:18.145 --> 16:20.280
I would never.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.216
[tense music]

16:23.250 --> 16:23.283
*

16:25.552 --> 16:26.653
Do I need to call a lawyer
or someone from my embassy?

16:27.487 --> 16:28.421
- Yeah, you can do that,
but listen,

16:29.522 --> 16:30.690
if you're telling the truth,
that you got drugged,

16:31.791 --> 16:32.392
then the best thing
is to let us take you to the ER,

16:33.026 --> 16:33.793
so we can run some tests.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.428
Also, you're gonna have
to tell us

16:35.528 --> 16:37.130
how you got in touch
with this escort.

16:37.230 --> 16:39.432
- I don't want my wife
to find out.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.534
- We have enough
to arrest you right now.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.204
She's definitely gonna
find out about that.

16:44.304 --> 16:47.674
If you work with us,
we'll try and work with you.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.742
It's your call, Mr. Krasnikov.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.415
- He found her
through Craigslist,

16:55.515 --> 16:58.285
paid cash,
and used a fake name.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.519
Good luck.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.588
- Luck is the residue of design.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.657
I called the number, booked
an afternoon date with Savannah.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.296
I hope I didn't overstep.

17:09.396 --> 17:12.031
- It's just--I'm more interested
in closing out the rape case

17:12.132 --> 17:13.533
than I am tracking down
some escort.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.368
- If we don't find her, though,

17:15.468 --> 17:18.171
he could claim that NYPD
ignored exculpatory evidence.

17:18.271 --> 17:21.674
- Okay. General note,
I prefer being kept in the loop.

17:23.410 --> 17:26.713
- My dad says I'm here
to take pressure off of you,

17:26.813 --> 17:29.482
but if you're not
comfortable delegating,

17:29.582 --> 17:31.318
I can respect that.

17:31.418 --> 17:33.620
- It's day one,
so for the time being,

17:33.720 --> 17:36.223
let's--let's check in
with each other.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.401
- Kim.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.537
- Wow, Amanda.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.205
You are so big.

17:52.305 --> 17:53.506
- What the hell is going on?

17:53.606 --> 17:54.641
How long have you been
in New York?

17:54.741 --> 17:56.243
- You having twins or what?

17:56.343 --> 17:57.544
- Sit down.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.346
Sit down
and you're gonna shut up,

17:59.446 --> 18:00.847
and you're gonna listen
for the first time in your life.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.449
You are in serious trouble.

18:02.549 --> 18:05.452
- For that warrant, still?
- Yeah, that too.

18:05.552 --> 18:09.088
But also that Russian guy
that you rolled last night.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.257
- What are you talking about?

18:10.357 --> 18:13.426
- The one whose flute
you pawned.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.130
After you drugged him,
he came to,

18:17.230 --> 18:19.499
and he raped a woman
in his hotel.

18:19.599 --> 18:22.569
- I didn't drug him,
and he gave me that flute.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.837
- Stop. Just stop it.
- He did.

18:24.937 --> 18:26.773
- It's over, Kim, and I want
you to come in with me.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.541
I want you to turn yourself in.

18:28.641 --> 18:30.543
I will get you a good lawyer,
but you've got to--

18:30.643 --> 18:33.413
- Well, isn't this a sight
for sore eyes.

18:33.513 --> 18:34.881
- Mama, you can't be here
right now.

18:34.981 --> 18:38.551
- We are discussing serious
police and legal business.

18:38.651 --> 18:40.887
- Well, it's my business too.
- I--

18:40.987 --> 18:45.692
- And...both of you girls
need your mother right now.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.695
[dramatic music]

18:48.795 --> 18:50.830
*

18:50.930 --> 18:52.699
- Savannah.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:52.799 --> 18:55.168
I know who you want, but you're
making a big mistake, pal.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.836
I mean...

18:56.936 --> 18:59.872
Melora here
is a much better girl.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.674
You told him
you'll do anything, right?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.543
- Yeah, and then he says
to call you.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.345
- Yeah, I'm not settling.

19:05.445 --> 19:08.848
I want Savannah--no offense.
My ex is a redhead.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.550
- Savannah's taking
a personal day,

19:10.650 --> 19:12.219
and you're gonna pay
for Melora's time one way

19:12.319 --> 19:13.453
or another.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.388
We understand each other?

19:15.488 --> 19:17.890
- Yeah, yeah, we do, we do.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.427
NYPD. Drop the blade
and put your hands up.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.395
- Unless you wanna get shot
right now.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.197
- Melora didn't do anything,
and you didn't pay anything,

19:24.297 --> 19:25.598
so what the hell is this,
some kind of shakedown?

19:25.698 --> 19:27.200
How much?

19:27.300 --> 19:29.269
- That's attempted
bribery right there.

19:29.369 --> 19:30.503
- We wanna talk
to talk to Savannah.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.405
You get her here,
this goes away.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.441
- What did she do?
- She rolled a john last night,

19:34.541 --> 19:36.476
stole his $50,000 flute.

19:36.576 --> 19:37.844
- She did what?

19:37.944 --> 19:39.846
- I told you not to trust her.
- Shut up.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.614
- Text her, Slice.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.852
- All right, all right.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.387
- I'm in trouble?

19:47.487 --> 19:48.921
You're the one
that's knocked up,

19:49.021 --> 19:50.223
and I bet you don't even know
who the father is.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.558
- Now, Kim, that's not nice.

19:51.658 --> 19:52.692
All I ask is that my daughters
get along.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.361
- Mama, she shot my boyfriend.

19:54.461 --> 19:56.329
- You set me up.
- You pulled the trigger,

19:56.429 --> 19:57.597
and I've been on the run
because of it.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.832
- You ran out
on a warrant, Kim.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.568
You cleaned out
my entire apartment.

20:01.668 --> 20:02.969
[cell phone chimes]
- All right, that's enough.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.771
Now, I'm going to go
find us some cocktails.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.839
When I get back, I expect you
all to be better behaved.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.841
- Okay, Mama.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.577
What did you think
was gonna happen, Kim?

20:10.677 --> 20:12.545
You're wanted for manslaughter
in New York,

20:12.645 --> 20:14.281
and you're here turning tricks.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.849
I mean, really?
Do you know NYPD has ID'd you?

20:16.949 --> 20:20.287
I've seen you, so you gotta
come with me voluntarily,

20:20.387 --> 20:22.289
or I gotta arrest you.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.724
- You wouldn't do that.
You'll break Mama's heart.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.326
[cell phone chimes]
And if you'll excuse me,

20:26.426 --> 20:27.594
my agent's texted me,
like, four times.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.995
- Your agent.
You mean your pimp?

20:29.095 --> 20:30.463
- Oh, you know what,
New York has made you so hard.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.698
- Yeah.
- I'm outta here.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.665
- No, you're not going anywhere.

20:32.765 --> 20:33.833
- I am too.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.935
I've always been
faster than you.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.337
Now you're carrying
all that extra weight.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.671
- Stop right there.
- Or what?

20:38.771 --> 20:41.374
You gonna shoot me here
in cold blood?

20:41.474 --> 20:42.642
- You know what,
they're gonna find you.

20:42.742 --> 20:43.810
- Like last time?

20:43.910 --> 20:45.445
I'm pretty good at disappearing.

20:45.545 --> 20:47.514
Tell Mama I say good-bye.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.759
- Where's Savannah?
- I don't know.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.361
She's not calling me back.
Look, I'm basically Uber.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.862
These girls
are independent contractors,

21:02.962 --> 21:05.732
and this one,
she's got a mind of her own.

21:05.832 --> 21:08.468
- Why is Sergeant Mike wasting
time talking to mini-pimp?

21:08.568 --> 21:09.969
- Because mini-pimp claims

21:10.069 --> 21:12.004
that he can deliver the girl
who rolled Anton.

21:12.104 --> 21:14.641
- So what?
The DNA reports just came in.

21:14.741 --> 21:17.777
Anton raped Alessandra,
so he's done, and we're done.

21:17.877 --> 21:19.846
- Okay, it's Dodds' first week.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.582
I can't shut down every idea
that he has.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.851
- I'll do it.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.388
- Fin, I asked you to take
the sergeant's exam.

21:28.488 --> 21:30.323
You told me you that you
wanted no part it, okay,

21:30.423 --> 21:31.458
so here's where we are.

21:32.892 --> 21:34.727
- You need to give us
her number.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.563
- Help yourself.
It's a burner cell.

21:36.663 --> 21:37.630
There's no GPS.

21:37.730 --> 21:38.731
She don't answer my calls,

21:38.831 --> 21:39.932
I doubt she's
gonna answer yours,

21:40.032 --> 21:41.067
so can I get the hell
out of here now?

21:41.167 --> 21:42.502
- Call her from yours again.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.903
You're stuck here
until she shows.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.473
- You know what,
before I call her,

21:46.573 --> 21:48.040
maybe I call my lawyer?

21:48.140 --> 21:51.077
[knocks on glass]
- You said the magic words.

21:51.177 --> 21:52.845
Wait here.

21:54.481 --> 21:56.516
- You wanna lawyer up, Slice?
You go ahead.

21:56.616 --> 21:59.619
You're free to do that,
but you're on my list now,

21:59.719 --> 22:02.555
and I'm free to follow you, tap
your phone, question your girls.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.424
- Come on, man.

22:04.524 --> 22:06.459
I ain't a bad guy.
She stole from me too.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.094
- Then find her.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.696
If you don't, I don't care
what bus you get on,

22:09.796 --> 22:10.730
what hole you crawl into.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.331
I will track you down

22:12.432 --> 22:13.733
and pull your testicles
out through your throat.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.502
[knocks on glass]

22:22.509 --> 22:24.411
He's this close
to giving me the girl.

22:24.511 --> 22:26.679
- Let Slice go.
We don't care about the escort.

22:26.779 --> 22:27.747
- Look, the DNA came back.

22:27.847 --> 22:29.749
We're charging Anton with rape.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.551
- Wait, even if he was drugged?

22:31.651 --> 22:33.753
- If his defense wants to argue
that, they are welcome to.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.722
We have made best efforts
to find the girl.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.724
Nobody can say that we didn't.
- All right.

22:37.824 --> 22:40.527
Well, we should at least
get a still from the pawn shop,

22:40.627 --> 22:42.462
make a wanted poster,
send it to DCPI.

22:42.562 --> 22:44.764
Rollins must have got
a hit from TARU by now.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.866
- They're backed up.
She went down there herself.

22:46.966 --> 22:48.968
- She did?

22:49.068 --> 22:50.703
Good.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.371
Okay. Until then,

22:52.472 --> 22:54.741
how about you two tell Anton
that he needs a lawyer.

22:57.810 --> 23:01.013
Hold up, Fin.
What's going on with Rollins?

23:01.113 --> 23:02.982
Is there something
I need to know?

23:03.082 --> 23:04.751
- How's that?

23:07.654 --> 23:10.389
- I appreciate you having
your partner's back.

23:11.658 --> 23:14.494
Get her in here now.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.897
- I'm telling you,
she slipped me something.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.832
Haven't you found that girl?

23:19.866 --> 23:19.899
- We're working with her pimp.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.936
- Pimp?

23:24.036 --> 23:26.706
Oh, so these are bad people.

23:26.806 --> 23:28.675
- Well, everybody's gotta
make a living, Anton,

23:28.775 --> 23:30.610
but we did find your flute
at a pawn shop.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.078
- Great.

23:32.178 --> 23:33.546
I'm not interested
in pressing charges.

23:33.646 --> 23:35.081
I just need it back.

23:35.181 --> 23:36.749
I have a concert tomorrow
in Montreal.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.151
- Oh, yeah?
You're not making that.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.520
- What are you talking about?

23:40.620 --> 23:41.521
- You're gonna be charged

23:42.321 --> 23:43.490
with the rape
of Alessandra Bay.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.492
- What?

23:45.592 --> 23:48.495
[dramatic music]

23:48.595 --> 23:51.831
*

23:51.931 --> 23:53.766
I couldn't have done that.

23:53.866 --> 23:57.169
- DNA says you did.
So does she.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.139
- Did you tell her
I was drugged?

24:01.674 --> 24:03.142
I want to talk to her.

24:03.242 --> 24:06.045
- Not happening,
but you do get one phone call.

24:07.747 --> 24:10.016
I'd try a lawyer.

24:10.116 --> 24:14.887
*

24:14.987 --> 24:17.590
- You recognized your sister
in the surveillance video

24:17.690 --> 24:20.059
from the pawn shop, and you
decided to keep it to yourself.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.728
- Because I thought
the best thing would be

24:21.828 --> 24:23.162
to set up a meeting,

24:23.262 --> 24:24.764
so that I could walk
her in without a struggle.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.132
- But she never showed, right?

24:26.232 --> 24:27.967
- No. Yeah, Fin, she did.
It's okay.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.069
She did show up, but she just
wouldn't listen to me.

24:30.169 --> 24:32.104
- So you just let her go?

24:32.204 --> 24:33.773
- Well,
I couldn't run after her,

24:33.873 --> 24:35.207
and it's not like I'm gonna
pull a gun in the park

24:35.307 --> 24:36.776
and shoot my sister
while my mom's on her way

24:36.876 --> 24:38.044
back from getting mimosas.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.647
- You do realize that you could
be charged as an accomplice,

24:40.747 --> 24:43.716
Amanda.
You could be fired.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.554
And where is your sister now?

24:47.654 --> 24:50.022
- She said
she was going to disappear.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.490
- Good luck.
Little Dodds is like a dog

24:51.591 --> 24:52.892
with a bone over this.

24:54.093 --> 24:55.094
- Can you call that guy off?
'Cause the last thing I need

24:55.962 --> 24:57.029
is him ratting me out
to Dodds Senior.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.898
- No, I can't.
- What--

24:58.998 --> 25:00.867
- Carisi and Dodds
picked up her pimp.

25:00.967 --> 25:04.036
He dimed on Kim when he found
out she stole Anton's flute.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.772
- And who would tell him that?

25:05.872 --> 25:09.742
- Rollins, from now on, all
communication with your family

25:09.842 --> 25:11.510
is to be recorded.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.780
- And you better figure out
a way to get Kim in here.

25:13.880 --> 25:16.949
- I tried. I tried to do that.
She will not listen to me.

25:17.049 --> 25:19.051
- Will she listen to your mom?
- I don't know.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.653
- Sorry to interrupt,
Lieutenant.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.021
I need to have a word
with you, privately.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.056
- Can it wait?
- No, not really.

25:24.156 --> 25:25.992
I ran the hotel
surveillance photo of that girl

25:26.092 --> 25:29.195
through facial recognition,
and I got a hit.

25:29.295 --> 25:32.164
[tense music]

25:32.264 --> 25:34.701
*

25:34.801 --> 25:36.869
- Close the door, please.

25:36.969 --> 25:42.274
*

25:42.374 --> 25:44.844
I just found out myself.

25:47.213 --> 25:50.917
But Rollins and Fin are gonna
figure out a way to solve this.

25:51.017 --> 25:56.756
*

25:56.856 --> 25:58.958
Mrs. Rollins,
thank you for coming in.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.226
Have a seat.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.261
Just so you know,
the camera is on,

26:02.361 --> 26:04.230
and this is Sergeant Mike Dodds.

26:04.330 --> 26:05.832
- Oh, the new sergeant.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.266
And you're filming me.

26:07.366 --> 26:09.902
This must be important.
How can I help?

26:10.002 --> 26:11.738
- It's about Kim, Mom.

26:11.838 --> 26:13.205
- Well, she already told us

26:13.305 --> 26:15.174
she has nothing to do
with whatever this is about.

26:15.274 --> 26:18.945
- Ma'am, is this your daughter?

26:20.647 --> 26:22.615
- It could be.

26:22.715 --> 26:24.216
Although I don't know why a girl
with such beautiful blonde hair

26:24.316 --> 26:25.818
would wear a wig like that.

26:25.918 --> 26:27.219
- Mom.

26:28.788 --> 26:30.056
- It's her.

26:30.156 --> 26:31.791
- There's an outstanding
warrant on her,

26:31.891 --> 26:33.192
and she's a suspect
in another crime.

26:33.292 --> 26:34.627
If you don't tell us
where she is,

26:34.727 --> 26:36.162
you'd be harboring a fugitive.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.331
- I'd love to help,
but honestly,

26:39.431 --> 26:40.933
I don't know
where that child went.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.334
- Mrs. Rollins,

26:42.434 --> 26:46.939
a man that she was working
for is very upset.

26:47.039 --> 26:48.340
He thinks she stole his money.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.979
- And if he finds her before
we do, he will hurt Kim.

26:53.079 --> 26:56.148
Do you--
do you understand that?

26:56.248 --> 26:57.917
- I didn't know.

26:58.017 --> 27:00.920
I've tried calling her
since Amanda and I saw her.

27:01.020 --> 27:01.988
- May I see your phone?

27:02.088 --> 27:04.190
What number do you have for her?

27:06.693 --> 27:08.260
- Give him the phone, Mother.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.805
- It's a different number
than her burner cell.

27:18.905 --> 27:20.339
Straight to voicemail.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.777
- Hi, honey, it's your mama.

27:24.877 --> 27:26.979
Can you call me back?

27:27.079 --> 27:29.749
- I'll put a trace on her phone.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.320
[cell phone vibrates]

27:34.420 --> 27:36.088
- It's Kim.

27:37.957 --> 27:39.859
Honey, where are you?

27:41.493 --> 27:45.031
Oh, okay.

27:45.131 --> 27:47.867
Why, it's in my cosmetics bag.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.202
Now listen, Kim, you need to
stay right where you are, okay?

27:50.302 --> 27:52.338
Promise me.

27:52.438 --> 27:53.940
Kim.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.877
She hung up.
- What did she say?

27:57.977 --> 27:59.311
Where is she?

28:01.313 --> 28:05.017
- You're not gonna hurt her,
are you?

28:05.117 --> 28:07.353
- Mrs. Rollins,

28:07.453 --> 28:09.889
you need to tell
us where she is,

28:09.989 --> 28:11.390
right now.

28:11.490 --> 28:14.927
[tense music]

28:15.027 --> 28:16.695
- Okay.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.966
She's at your apartment.

28:20.066 --> 28:23.335
I was kind of putting a little
bit of money aside for her.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.906
*

28:27.006 --> 28:29.909
[dramatic music]

28:30.009 --> 28:35.481
*

28:35.581 --> 28:36.849
- There she is.

28:38.150 --> 28:40.219
- Hey. Slow down, Kim.
- What?

28:40.319 --> 28:42.254
- Hey, slow down.
- Wh--

28:42.354 --> 28:43.823
Kim Rollins,
you're under arrest.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.191
- For what?

28:45.291 --> 28:47.226
- Kim.

28:47.326 --> 28:48.995
- You set me up, Amanda.
- Kim, what happened?

28:49.095 --> 28:50.496
Are you okay?
- I am.

28:50.596 --> 28:52.164
I'm not so sure he is.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.166
- He who?
- Slice. He came after me.

28:54.200 --> 28:54.233
He wanted my money,
but it was all self-defense.

28:57.136 --> 28:59.738
- I'm going upstairs.
- No, not a chance.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.373
You shouldn't even be here.

29:01.473 --> 29:03.342
As of right now, you have to
recuse yourself from the case.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.944
Give me the keys.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.345
Keys.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.216
Fin, Carisi, go.
- On it.

29:10.316 --> 29:12.084
- You always have to be
the good girl, don't you?

29:12.184 --> 29:13.385
Why don't you
let me live my life?

29:13.485 --> 29:15.822
- Kim, I'd advise you
to stop talking.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.825
- NYPD.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.994
- Help me, help me.
[grunting and groaning]

29:22.094 --> 29:23.863
- Slice, what happened?

29:23.963 --> 29:25.131
- She stabbed me.

29:25.231 --> 29:27.366
That crazy bitch
stabbed me in my nuts.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.169
- Did she?

29:32.038 --> 29:34.106
- You're under arrest.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.909
- You gotta be kidding me.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.215
- No. I'll take
her to interrogation.

29:43.315 --> 29:44.450
- Actually, have
somebody else do it.

29:44.550 --> 29:45.885
Get a uni, please.
- Kimmy!

29:45.985 --> 29:47.086
Oh, my God.
- Mama.

29:48.087 --> 29:49.288
- Thank God you're okay.
You've got blood on you.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.890
What did you do to her?

29:50.990 --> 29:52.091
- They didn't do anything
to her, Mama.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.292
She decided to attack her agent.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.261
- He had it coming.
- Carisi called.

29:55.361 --> 29:56.863
Slice is in the ER.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.497
He lost a lot of blood,
but he'll make it.

29:58.597 --> 30:01.233
- Okay, have him wait there
and get his statement. Fin.

30:01.333 --> 30:03.535
Fin, please drive Mrs. Rollins
and Amanda home.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.304
I will talk to Kim.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.405
- If you're gonna do that,
I'm staying here.

30:06.505 --> 30:07.874
- No, you're not.

30:07.974 --> 30:09.408
- It's fine, Amanda.
I can talk.

30:09.508 --> 30:11.410
- Listen, you're gonna
keep your mouth shut

30:11.510 --> 30:13.379
until your sister
gets you a lawyer.

30:13.479 --> 30:14.546
Okay? Please take
her to holding.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.316
Fin, take them home now.

30:17.349 --> 30:17.383
- What about Kimmie?

30:19.318 --> 30:20.953
- She's staying, Mama.
She's under arrest.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.188
- Oh, God.

30:24.656 --> 30:27.359
- Ms. Rollins has nothing
to hide.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.195
We'll answer any questions
about last night's incident.

30:29.295 --> 30:31.097
It's a clear case
of self-defense.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.264
- Okay, okay.

30:33.499 --> 30:36.468
So, Kim...

30:36.568 --> 30:38.337
tell me how we got here.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.406
- Well, Slice kept texting me,

30:40.506 --> 30:43.842
and he was real, real angry.

30:43.943 --> 30:47.513
You should not have
told him about the flute.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.982
So, I had to get
out of town,

30:50.082 --> 30:52.251
and so I gave my money
to my mom,

30:52.351 --> 30:54.220
and she took it
to Amanda's apartment.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.587
- Well, how did he find you?

30:55.687 --> 30:57.223
- Why don't you ask him that?

30:57.323 --> 30:59.191
I mean, he stalked my client.

30:59.225 --> 30:59.258
- Yeah, I mean, he was banging
on that door.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.430
He was so mad, and I tried
to keep him in the hallway,

31:04.530 --> 31:07.633
but he just barged through
and just started beating on me,

31:07.733 --> 31:09.868
so I lied and said that,

31:09.969 --> 31:11.170
you know, the money
was under the couch,

31:11.270 --> 31:14.373
and when he went to look,
I grabbed his knife.

31:14.473 --> 31:16.108
He turned and lunged.

31:16.208 --> 31:18.377
Next thing I know, he's on
the floor, and I was running.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.646
- Was this the money you got
from stealing that flute?

31:20.746 --> 31:22.915
- The flute Mr. Krasnikov
gave you.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.117
- Yeah, it was a gift.
- A gift?

31:25.217 --> 31:27.253
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

31:27.353 --> 31:30.622
Well, Let's talk about
your session with Mr. Krasnikov.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.124
- Everything was legal, okay.

31:32.224 --> 31:34.893
They met online.
They went on a date.

31:34.994 --> 31:37.896
- So, Kim, you're saying that

31:37.997 --> 31:41.033
Mr. Krasnikov, after one date,

31:41.133 --> 31:43.202
was so smitten with you

31:43.302 --> 31:46.238
that he gave you
a $50,000 flute?

31:46.338 --> 31:48.540
- Yeah.
[chuckles]

31:48.640 --> 31:50.509
He said it was insured,
you know.

31:50.609 --> 31:54.346
He just wanted to help me
get my life back together,

31:54.446 --> 31:56.682
get me enough
to go back to school,

31:56.782 --> 31:59.251
and, maybe if there was
a little left over,

31:59.351 --> 32:02.288
give it to Amanda and the baby.

32:02.388 --> 32:04.690
- I know, I know.

32:04.790 --> 32:08.460
- Was Mr. Krasnikov sober
when he gave you this flute?

32:08.560 --> 32:11.530
- He'd had a few drinks,
you know, had a couple pills.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.665
- Pills.

32:13.765 --> 32:16.135
Kim, were those your pills?
- No.

32:16.235 --> 32:17.369
He offered,
but I don't do drugs.

32:17.469 --> 32:19.605
I mean, they just make
people do crazy things.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.473
- Okay, Kim.

32:21.573 --> 32:24.410
Why don't we stop here?

32:24.510 --> 32:28.080
- I will defer to Mr. Desappio.
[chuckles]

32:29.248 --> 32:31.717
How he assaulted
that poor woman, I mean,

32:31.817 --> 32:33.552
if he hadn't've done that,

32:33.652 --> 32:36.522
none of us would be
in this situation.

32:36.622 --> 32:40.392
[tense music]

32:40.492 --> 32:41.994
- Anton Krasnikov,

32:42.094 --> 32:43.662
you are charged with rape
in the first degree.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.231
How do you plead?

32:45.331 --> 32:47.399
- My client pleads not guilty,
Your Honor.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.235
Mr. Krasnikov was
under the influence

32:49.335 --> 32:51.637
of an anesthetic narcotic
given to him

32:51.737 --> 32:54.306
without his knowledge or consent
by a known criminal.

32:54.406 --> 32:55.974
- An escort he hired.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.044
She denies administering
anything to him,

32:58.144 --> 33:00.312
and there were no drugs
found in his system.

33:00.412 --> 33:03.349
He was on a sex and drinking
binge that turned violent.

33:03.449 --> 33:05.417
- This is a nightmare.
I don't remember any of this.

33:05.517 --> 33:08.020
- You'll get your chance
to tell that to a jury, sir.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.022
People on bail.
- We request remand.

33:10.122 --> 33:12.458
Mr. Krasnikov is an
international celebrity

33:12.558 --> 33:13.992
here on a travel visa.

33:14.093 --> 33:16.995
He has ample opportunity
and means to flee.

33:17.096 --> 33:20.266
- Mr. Krasnikov is a
universally-respected flautist.

33:20.366 --> 33:23.269
He has to travel to play
concerts and needs his passport.

33:23.369 --> 33:25.604
- We're not chasing him
halfway across the world.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.606
Mr. Krasnikov,
you are remanded without bail.

33:27.706 --> 33:29.041
Next case.

33:33.379 --> 33:35.581
- What does that mean?

33:35.681 --> 33:38.584
[somber music]

33:38.684 --> 33:43.355
*

33:43.455 --> 33:46.358
Wait!
Lieutenant,

33:46.392 --> 33:46.425
are people actually gonna
buy Anton's drug story?

33:49.228 --> 33:50.696
- I don't know.
- But they just said

33:50.796 --> 33:52.431
that there were no drugs
found in his system.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.301
- That's true, but--
- He knew exactly

33:55.401 --> 33:58.137
what he was doing.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.772
- One thing you don't understand
about my sister is that

34:00.872 --> 34:03.809
she doesn't hear anything
she doesn't want to hear,

34:03.909 --> 34:05.811
especially coming from me.
- I understand.

34:05.911 --> 34:09.081
- So you've made her understand
that if she doesn't take a plea,

34:09.181 --> 34:10.682
she's looking at
a really long stretch?

34:10.782 --> 34:13.552
- Don't worry, Detective.
I've spoken to the ADA.

34:13.652 --> 34:15.787
We're on the same page.
- Okay.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.190
Thanks.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.092
- Has Dodds said anything to you
all about me and Kim?

34:20.192 --> 34:21.560
- Don't worry
about what he says to us.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.429
It's what he says
to his dad that matters.

34:23.529 --> 34:26.165
- Welcome back to New York,
Ms. Rollins.

34:26.265 --> 34:28.700
I see there's an outstanding
warrant on you,

34:28.800 --> 34:30.469
manslaughter
in the second degree

34:30.569 --> 34:32.138
in the death of Jeff Parker.

34:32.238 --> 34:33.672
- Oh, no, I can explain that.
- Ah, no, shh.

34:33.772 --> 34:36.675
- We are additionally charging
Ms. Rollins with grand larceny

34:36.775 --> 34:40.412
in the second degree
and assault in the first degree.

34:40.512 --> 34:44.150
However, in exchange
for a guilty plea on man two,

34:44.250 --> 34:46.418
the people are prepared
to drop the other charges.

34:46.518 --> 34:49.421
- Understood.
Ms. Rollins, how do you plead?

34:49.521 --> 34:51.823
[no audible dialogue]

34:51.923 --> 34:54.593
Ms. Rollins?

34:54.693 --> 34:57.196
- Come on.
- Is there a problem, Counselor?

34:57.296 --> 34:59.698
We're waiting for your plea.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.467
- Not guilty on all charges,
Your Honor.

35:01.567 --> 35:04.236
- This was not my understanding,
Your Honor,

35:04.336 --> 35:08.207
but if this is where we are,
we will proceed on all charges.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.275
- Very well.

35:09.375 --> 35:10.809
As for bail,

35:10.909 --> 35:14.280
Ms. Rollins has been a fugitive
for the last 2 1/2 years.

35:14.380 --> 35:17.283
She is remanded to Rikers
while awaiting trial.

35:18.417 --> 35:20.352
- [whispers]
Thank you so much.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.820
- She skips out on her warrant,

35:21.920 --> 35:24.156
and now she wants
to go to trial?

35:24.256 --> 35:26.192
- My sister, the gift
that keeps on giving.

35:26.292 --> 35:29.461
- Can you imagine the headlines?
- Carisi.

35:29.561 --> 35:30.696
- Mom.

35:30.796 --> 35:32.864
Mom. Hey.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.566
You got to talk to Kim.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.202
She's making a mistake.

35:36.302 --> 35:39.605
- She is? You're the one
who had her arrested,

35:39.705 --> 35:42.708
and you used me
to set up my own daughter.

35:42.808 --> 35:46.312
If you hadn't, she'd be safe
and sound and out of town.

35:46.412 --> 35:49.348
- If we hadn't found Kim,
her pimp could have killed her.

35:49.448 --> 35:50.782
- What are you talking about?

35:50.882 --> 35:52.551
She handled that man just fine.

35:52.651 --> 35:55.387
- No, she did--
- Kim can take care of herself.

35:55.487 --> 35:57.723
This was about you.
- What are you talking about?

35:57.823 --> 36:00.359
- You chose your work
over your family...

36:00.459 --> 36:01.893
- Oh, my God.
- Just like you always have.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.662
- Can we not do this now?

36:03.762 --> 36:05.231
- No, let's not do this at all.

36:05.331 --> 36:07.666
- Why, what do you mean?
Huh?

36:07.766 --> 36:08.667
- I'm sorry, darling.

36:08.767 --> 36:10.702
I came up here to help you,

36:10.802 --> 36:13.505
but it's quite clear
you know what you're doing.

36:13.605 --> 36:14.640
I'd just be in the way.

36:14.740 --> 36:18.244
- Okay, so what,
you're gonna leave?

36:18.344 --> 36:20.312
- I'll be back
for your sister's trial,

36:20.412 --> 36:23.315
and maybe by then,
you will have finally learned

36:23.415 --> 36:25.317
the value of family.

36:25.417 --> 36:28.320
[tense music]

36:28.420 --> 36:30.356
*

36:30.456 --> 36:33.292
- She's leaving? Now?
- Yeah.

36:35.294 --> 36:37.729
Yeah. She'll be back.
I mean, she's a drama queen.

36:37.829 --> 36:40.332
Where do you think
Kim gets it from?

36:42.701 --> 36:44.403
[coughs]

36:45.371 --> 36:47.205
- Amanda, you okay?

36:47.306 --> 36:48.574
- Yeah.
- You sure?

36:48.674 --> 36:50.542
- Yeah.

36:50.642 --> 36:51.677
- No, you're not.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:51.777 --> 36:52.678
We're taking you to a hospital.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.346
- Yeah.
- I--

36:54.446 --> 36:55.681
Let's go, guys.
- [groans]

37:01.387 --> 37:02.521
She going into labor?

37:02.621 --> 37:04.723
- Somebody would've told us.

37:04.823 --> 37:08.460
- So Rollins' family, huh?

37:08.560 --> 37:09.895
- All families got stuff.

37:09.995 --> 37:13.332
- Yeah, but hers has,
like, a lot.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.602
- There she is.
- Hey.

37:18.770 --> 37:20.439
- You guys are still here?

37:20.539 --> 37:22.774
- Oh, well,
Fin was worried about you.

37:22.874 --> 37:25.444
- Mm.
It's nothing to worry about.

37:25.544 --> 37:28.580
My doctor said that my blood
pressure spiked, that's all.

37:28.680 --> 37:29.848
[clears throat]
Asked if I had been

37:29.948 --> 37:32.551
under any extra stress lately.

37:32.651 --> 37:34.586
- What do you say
we drive you home?

37:39.658 --> 37:41.893
- Keep me posted.

37:41.993 --> 37:44.596
Okay, great.
Thanks.

37:44.696 --> 37:46.298
- How's Detective Rollins doing?

37:46.398 --> 37:48.367
- She's okay, you know.

37:48.467 --> 37:49.868
Carisi and Fin are with her now.

37:49.968 --> 37:52.838
- You know,
she's getting pretty close.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.774
Maybe she should take some time
off before she has the baby.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.042
- I can ask.

37:57.142 --> 37:59.978
- And, Mike, everything
going well with him?

38:00.078 --> 38:01.980
- He is stepping up.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.982
- Any issues, let me know.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.751
- Okay.

38:09.120 --> 38:10.856
- My dad's checking up on me?

38:10.956 --> 38:13.291
Sorry about that.
- Yeah, it's all good.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.727
You mind closing the door?

38:18.564 --> 38:19.898
Have a seat.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.737
So, just so we're clear,

38:25.837 --> 38:29.575
when I told you not to check up
on Anton's escort,

38:29.675 --> 38:31.977
I had no idea that
that was Rollins' sister.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.779
- No worries.
That's not my business.

38:33.879 --> 38:36.648
- I really did find out
the same time you did,

38:36.748 --> 38:39.551
and as for Rollins and Fin,

38:39.651 --> 38:41.353
I've spoken to them,

38:41.453 --> 38:44.590
and I will be continuing
to speak to them.

38:45.991 --> 38:47.959
- Go easy.

38:48.059 --> 38:51.397
Family's complicated.

38:51.497 --> 38:54.332
Look, I know everybody's worried
that I'm the boss' son,

38:54.433 --> 38:57.936
and they're saying they have
to watch themselves around me.

38:58.036 --> 39:00.372
- Nobody's saying that.

39:00.472 --> 39:02.974
- Right.

39:03.074 --> 39:05.577
I just want you to know,

39:05.677 --> 39:07.413
what happens at SVU

39:07.513 --> 39:09.748
stays at SVU.

39:09.848 --> 39:11.517
You have my word.

39:13.719 --> 39:15.053
- Okay.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.596
[lock buzzes]
[gate opens]

39:30.135 --> 39:33.739
- Amanda, you came.

39:33.839 --> 39:36.542
Oh.
- I'm due at work, Kim.

39:36.642 --> 39:37.876
What do you want?
- For you to know

39:37.976 --> 39:40.812
that everything
is gonna be all right.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.781
- Why? 'cause you--

39:42.881 --> 39:45.851
you batted your eyelashes
at that lawyer?

39:45.951 --> 39:47.385
He's gonna be your savior now?

39:47.486 --> 39:48.687
- Well, Lorenzo wants
to go to trial,

39:48.787 --> 39:50.856
but I called him off.
- Lorenzo?

39:50.956 --> 39:52.891
- Yeah, Lorenzo Desappio.

39:52.991 --> 39:55.126
Isn't that perfect?

39:55.226 --> 39:56.462
You were right about him.

39:56.562 --> 39:58.464
He is just the loveliest man.

39:58.564 --> 40:01.433
- Okay, your point, Kim?

40:01.533 --> 40:02.734
- Well, I told him
that I couldn't

40:02.834 --> 40:04.169
put you through all that stress.
- [chuckles]

40:04.269 --> 40:07.539
- Now you can't put me
through stress?

40:07.639 --> 40:11.142
- I don't want
you to have to testify.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.112
Don't be mad, but, uh...

40:14.212 --> 40:18.149
Lorenzo said a lot of stuff
when he met with the DA.

40:19.150 --> 40:21.419
- What kind of stuff?

40:21.520 --> 40:24.690
- Like how you didn't tell
your boss that you'd ID'd me,

40:24.790 --> 40:27.859
or that I was even in town...

40:27.959 --> 40:31.096
also, our personal history,
you know,

40:31.196 --> 40:32.631
our cycle of abuse

40:32.731 --> 40:35.567
and how you were raped
on the job

40:35.667 --> 40:39.137
and your gambling addiction.

40:41.139 --> 40:44.042
All that stuff would've come up
during the trial.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.146
- Right.

40:54.052 --> 40:57.022
I don't know, Kim,
you do what you have to.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.925
You always have.
- It's fine.

41:00.025 --> 41:02.794
Lorenzo is sure that we can
work out some kind of a--

41:02.894 --> 41:04.763
oh, what did he call it?

41:04.863 --> 41:08.534
A one-size-fits-all plea,
on Slice and on that old warrant

41:08.634 --> 41:12.838
and especially if I cooperate
and testify against Anton.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.774
I mean, what he did
to that poor woman is...

41:17.576 --> 41:20.478
And if everything
goes as planned,

41:20.579 --> 41:23.649
Lorenzo thinks I might be out
in under a year.

41:23.749 --> 41:25.617
- That's not gonna happen, Kim.

41:25.717 --> 41:28.854
- Well, either way,
he says he'll wait for me.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.889
- Come again?

41:30.989 --> 41:33.491
- I think Lorenzo's gonna
ask me to marry him.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.195
Wouldn't that be something?

41:37.295 --> 41:39.030
Like Mama says,

41:39.130 --> 41:41.833
everything works out in the end.

41:41.933 --> 41:44.836
[tense music]

41:44.936 --> 41:51.843
