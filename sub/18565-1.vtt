02:30.465 --> 02:33.996
Aye.
I thought I was doing upstairs.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.399
You better be.
I don't want to be here all night.

02:36.424 --> 02:38.827
Whoa, whose up here then?

02:38.852 --> 02:40.527
What's wrong?

02:40.552 --> 02:42.143
Is someone else up here?

02:42.168 --> 02:44.542
I'm not.
What do you need?

02:44.567 --> 02:46.839
Woo.
It's probably a ghost.

02:46.864 --> 02:48.559
Want me to come up there
and hold your hand?

02:48.587 --> 02:50.931
- Shut up, Mike.
- You shut up.

02:50.956 --> 02:52.396
Both of you shut up.

02:52.421 --> 02:55.619
I swear to god you guys are
too old for this crap.

02:55.644 --> 02:58.233
Kyle, finish up.

02:58.661 --> 03:00.467
Yes sir.

03:26.520 --> 03:29.821
Alright, Mike. You're wasting time
we could be drinking.

03:36.575 --> 03:38.352
Mike?

04:57.568 --> 04:59.974
Every week, we visit
a new location,

04:59.999 --> 05:03.767
rumored to be haunted by
America's most notorious ghost.

05:03.792 --> 05:05.394
Go, go, go.

05:05.816 --> 05:07.357
Rob Jackson
Investigator

05:08.255 --> 05:09.771
Emily Sweet
Investigator

05:09.796 --> 05:11.632
These ghost have
overstayed their welcome

05:11.657 --> 05:15.802
and it's time to serve them
some other worldly justice.

05:16.270 --> 05:17.317
Scotty McDonald
Technical Specialist

05:18.164 --> 05:19.808
Oh my god.
No.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.072
Leon Falco
Lead Investigator.

05:21.401 --> 05:24.421
We're not here to prove anything.
- Leon. Leon, get me out!

05:24.446 --> 05:25.269
Leon.
Get me out of here!

05:25.316 --> 05:27.261
We're here to kick
these ghost out.

05:27.286 --> 05:29.594
and send them back
where they belong.

05:29.619 --> 05:34.088
Welcome to
America's Most Haunted

05:34.468 --> 05:36.508
I got something here.

05:36.533 --> 05:38.546
You can feel that.
Did you feel that?

05:38.594 --> 05:40.991
Yeah. Yeah, I felt that.
I felt it too.

05:41.016 --> 05:42.396
Whof.
It looks like as if...

05:42.421 --> 05:45.220
it just feel like, it got like really,
really cold.

05:45.245 --> 05:46.552
Yeah, like the temperature
just dropped.

05:46.577 --> 05:48.696
- Yeah. Do you guys feel that?
- Yeah.

05:48.721 --> 05:51.560
Yeah. Yeah.
He's definitely here.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.810
- Whoa. Whoa.
- Look. Look.

05:53.835 --> 05:55.760
Just then, the ghost
monitor we have placed

05:55.785 --> 05:59.363
at the other end of the
hall was activated.

05:59.388 --> 06:02.023
Okay. Don't move.
Don't move. Shh, shh.

06:02.048 --> 06:03.533
I'm just gonna try
to talk to him.

06:03.558 --> 06:05.354
Okay.

06:07.053 --> 06:09.249
Hello.

06:09.672 --> 06:12.106
James Baker.

06:12.328 --> 06:15.172
James, are you here
with us?

06:16.588 --> 06:18.351
Man.
Did you hear that?

06:18.399 --> 06:20.247
- Yeah. Yeah, I heard it was...
- Like 2 words.

06:20.272 --> 06:22.214
Yeah, it was like uh.
it's like "Get out", right?

06:22.239 --> 06:23.310
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It sounds like
- Like "Get out".

06:23.335 --> 06:24.607
"Get out."

06:24.632 --> 06:25.799
- As you listen again,
- Shh, shh.

06:25.824 --> 06:27.410
and we amplified the audio,

06:27.435 --> 06:31.290
you can clearly make out
the words "Get out".

06:36.126 --> 06:37.900
Shh, shh, shh.

06:37.925 --> 06:40.220
James, we heard you.

06:41.258 --> 06:43.477
If you're here.

06:43.502 --> 06:46.514
If you're here with us,
let us know.

06:46.711 --> 06:49.192
You got to give us
a sign, James.

06:50.181 --> 06:52.142
- Oh my god.
- It was right behind me dude.

06:52.167 --> 06:55.777
That was right behind me.
He's here.

06:55.807 --> 06:57.737
Let's get this ghost.
Let's...

06:57.795 --> 06:59.442
Let's get this ghost... st.

06:59.467 --> 07:01.708
Let's get this ghost.
rrr...

07:04.491 --> 07:07.512
- He's here.
- Let's get this ghost.

07:08.034 --> 07:10.810
Okay. Okay.
Go back to the bucket.

07:12.087 --> 07:13.595
Stop!
Right there.

07:13.620 --> 07:15.072
Do you see it?

07:15.097 --> 07:16.767
Shit.

07:19.719 --> 07:21.293
What is it?

07:21.318 --> 07:23.232
It's Jimmy.

07:26.930 --> 07:29.743
Yeah. That's as close
to the wall as I can get.

07:29.768 --> 07:31.184
Alright, my friend.
Listen.

07:31.209 --> 07:32.954
You are the editor now.

07:32.979 --> 07:35.443
That means you are
the last line of defense.

07:35.468 --> 07:38.442
Okay. We can't have stuff
like this making it to broadcast.

07:38.467 --> 07:39.778
I mean although Jimmy is

07:39.803 --> 07:42.089
terribly, terribly frightening.

07:42.114 --> 07:43.113
It's a...

07:43.138 --> 07:45.642
We can't have him in the shots.
It sort of ruin the mystique.

07:45.667 --> 07:48.143
- So I'll cut it out.
- Magic out the whole thing.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.602
Yeah, I understand.

07:49.627 --> 07:51.616
So, I'll cut it out.

07:51.641 --> 07:54.780
I don't know.
Cut it. Zoom it. Paint it. Edit it.

07:54.820 --> 07:58.245
Edit. You edit it.
That's why we hired you.

07:58.270 --> 08:00.399
- Okay.
- See, that's why Pete left.

08:00.424 --> 08:01.623
- What?
- That right there.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.225
That's why Pete left.
You come across like a um.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.251
How do I want to put this,
like a dick.

08:06.276 --> 08:09.364
Pete left because he got
some job and some

08:09.389 --> 08:14.403
Special victims, Crime scene investigation,
Missing person show.

08:14.428 --> 08:17.293
- Really, which show?
- I don't know, pick one.

08:17.318 --> 08:20.745
- You know you're a dick right.
- Look, it doesn't matter now. Okay.

08:20.770 --> 08:23.104
Pets's gone.
Kurt's here.

08:23.129 --> 08:24.783
- Kevin.
- Kevin's here.

08:24.808 --> 08:26.960
- Kevin?
- Yeah.

08:26.985 --> 08:28.200
Kevin's here.

08:28.225 --> 08:30.126
See, and he's going to
continue our

08:30.151 --> 08:32.472
noble tradition of providing the

08:32.498 --> 08:35.770
highest quality of entertainment
for our many, many loyal fans.

08:35.794 --> 08:37.251
Right, Kevin?

08:37.277 --> 08:39.309
So, stop pooping
on my parade, Jimmy.

08:39.335 --> 08:40.726
This is going to be great.

08:40.751 --> 08:42.375
This is it.
It's going to be great!

08:42.400 --> 08:43.926
I can feel it!

08:43.951 --> 08:46.442
Production meeting in 10 minutes.

08:46.985 --> 08:49.316
He's a dick, right?

08:51.915 --> 08:53.394
So.

08:53.487 --> 08:55.807
- Is any of it real?
- Real?

08:55.833 --> 08:56.835
Yeah, like.

08:56.859 --> 08:58.900
You know. Do you ever see
any real ghost and stuff.

08:58.925 --> 09:01.999
No, no, no.
Not really.

09:02.039 --> 09:03.893
So, what does all this do then?

09:03.918 --> 09:07.293
Oh. Mostly it lights up,
looks good on camera.

09:07.742 --> 09:09.082
I mean its...
it's real stuff.

09:09.106 --> 09:12.151
Like this is a real motion sensor and
this is really an EMF detector.

09:12.176 --> 09:13.799
I just.
I modified them for the show.

09:13.824 --> 09:16.906
so we can trigger it remotely
and stuff like that.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.345
Okay, so that it all
would work if it had to.

09:20.370 --> 09:24.009
No. No. I modified them
passed any practical usage.

09:24.034 --> 09:26.014
- Oh.
- Except.

09:26.039 --> 09:28.284
This puppy.

09:30.087 --> 09:32.775
Built it myself.
From scratch.

09:32.847 --> 09:34.699
- What's that?
- I called it...

09:34.724 --> 09:36.568
The "Ghost burst."

09:36.593 --> 09:39.218
- Ha-ha.
- No, shh.

09:41.117 --> 09:42.140
What does it do?

09:42.165 --> 09:47.049
It emits a small scale of EMP
and a blast of full spectrum light.

09:47.215 --> 09:49.293
Wow. I have no idea
what that means?

09:49.318 --> 09:51.861
Truth is,
I've never really tested it.

09:51.886 --> 09:57.476
It would probably destroy
anything electronic within 500 yards.

09:57.787 --> 09:59.553
If it worked.

09:59.578 --> 10:02.556
That's why,
I also build a small scale version.

10:02.581 --> 10:03.853
What does that one do?

10:03.878 --> 10:06.320
Lights up,
looks good on camera.

10:06.345 --> 10:08.283
- Right, yeah.
- Yup.

10:08.308 --> 10:12.381
Last resort on this puppy in case
things ever get, you know.

10:12.406 --> 10:14.505
Real scary.

10:14.971 --> 10:16.745
Okay.

10:16.983 --> 10:19.902
- Yeah.
- Okay.

10:19.958 --> 10:23.410
- Cool.
- Yeah.

10:30.723 --> 10:34.089
So as... soon as Emily has done
with her personal business,

10:34.114 --> 10:36.467
- we can all get started.
- Thank you so much. I'm...

10:36.492 --> 10:38.979
really looking forward
to meeting you.

10:39.058 --> 10:40.686
Okay, great.

10:40.711 --> 10:42.454
Bye.

10:44.495 --> 10:46.443
I got a...
I got a call back.

10:46.468 --> 10:48.795
That's great Em.
When do you leave?

10:48.820 --> 10:52.537
Next week, but it's just
a call back.  So.

10:52.562 --> 10:56.011
Okay. Well, just to...
You know, be clear.

10:56.036 --> 10:58.307
Do you still have time for this or
there is somewhere else you need to be.

10:58.332 --> 11:02.177
I'm here Leon, okay.
Let's just focus on what's next.

11:02.202 --> 11:05.204
Nobody knows what's
going to happen anyway.

11:05.229 --> 11:07.006
So it's nice.

11:07.031 --> 11:10.002
Did I hear something
about Michigan?

11:10.682 --> 11:11.987
Alright.

11:12.012 --> 11:13.509
Next up, we have.

11:13.535 --> 11:15.278
Saqwasibi Fine Arts Camp.

11:15.303 --> 11:20.308
A secluded artist school and
retreat center in northern Michigan.

11:20.333 --> 11:23.999
A 5 mile, one lane dirt road that
winds through the dense forest

11:24.024 --> 11:29.488
is in fact the only way
in or out of Saqwasibi.

11:29.972 --> 11:33.655
Mid 1800s.
Michigan's logging industry was booming.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.186
Making more people rich than
any gold rush out west ever would.

11:37.211 --> 11:39.410
The George family fortune
was made here.

11:39.442 --> 11:42.270
Ralph George.
Owner and operator of Saqwasibi,

11:42.295 --> 11:47.702
which is band his family since
it's original construction in 1852.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.672
Ralph George, Owner
- This is a Saqwasibi hotel.

11:50.697 --> 11:52.763
It's no longer a
logging camp but

11:52.788 --> 11:57.010
the houses, the structures, the grounds
are pretty much the same.

11:57.035 --> 12:00.604
Except for some basic upgrades,
a few modifications

12:00.629 --> 12:03.589
Well the camp is remained
relatively unchanged,

12:03.614 --> 12:06.913
it certainly has seen
it's share of disturbances.

12:06.938 --> 12:10.592
Our story really begins in 1859.

12:10.617 --> 12:13.758
When a lumberjack by
the name of Pierre Boutierre

12:13.783 --> 12:15.977
killed a whole bunch
of people.

12:16.002 --> 12:18.033
All of them right here
in this hotel.

12:18.058 --> 12:21.398
A serious change in behavior for
Mr Boutierre was first noted

12:21.423 --> 12:24.551
during an incident involving
some of the children of the camp.

12:24.576 --> 12:29.308
The children used to like to
play around Boutierre's cabin

12:29.333 --> 12:31.770
One day, one of them,
accidentally I am sure,

12:31.794 --> 12:35.399
threw a rock and it went
through his window.

12:35.431 --> 12:38.791
Pierre just lost it,
he really lost it.

12:38.816 --> 12:43.607
Well... all of a sudden, Pierre
tears out the of the cabin.

12:43.632 --> 12:46.885
And he's carrying a
fire place log in his hand.

12:46.910 --> 12:48.837
And he begins to
beat the kids up,

12:48.862 --> 12:52.806
and he be actually breaks
a couple of their bones.

12:52.831 --> 12:55.770
He nearly killed one of them
before he was stopped.

12:55.803 --> 12:57.376
The community brought
Mr Boutierre

12:57.420 --> 13:00.328
before the foreman and
the other heads of the camp.

13:00.359 --> 13:04.406
Well, it was right here in this
very room that they had their

13:04.431 --> 13:06.618
gatherings and their meetings.

13:06.661 --> 13:12.130
So it's probably in this very room
that they had their questioning or trial.

13:12.442 --> 13:15.585
They decided it was best to
ask Mr Boutierre to leave

13:15.610 --> 13:17.609
on the next wagon out of town.

13:17.656 --> 13:20.334
Much of the logging was
done in the winter months

13:20.359 --> 13:22.118
because it was easier to

13:22.143 --> 13:25.128
sled the lumber down
to the river's bank

13:25.163 --> 13:28.236
and then wait for the foreman
and rafted down the river

13:28.261 --> 13:32.442
But this year was a
particularly tough winter.

13:32.587 --> 13:36.760
Bad patch and they were
completely snowed in.

13:36.785 --> 13:40.158
Nothing went in or out
of that camp.

13:40.188 --> 13:42.351
Boutierre was asked to
stay in his quarters

13:42.376 --> 13:44.644
until the roads were passable.

13:44.669 --> 13:48.437
Guess they, they never thought
they needed to lock him down.

13:48.462 --> 13:50.600
There've never been
an incident like this before

13:50.625 --> 13:54.449
He was a man.
A quiet man, very quiet man.

13:54.479 --> 13:59.166
They certainly never anticipated
what was going to happen next.

14:09.562 --> 14:14.336
That night,
Pierre left his quarters.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.952
Got an axe.

14:17.977 --> 14:20.182
He snapped.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.724
He just snapped.

14:30.233 --> 14:31.965
Pierre went from
room to room.

14:31.990 --> 14:35.682
Terrifying, maiming and killing
anyone unfortunate enough

14:35.718 --> 14:38.966
to be caught in his
murderous path.

14:50.250 --> 14:51.651
When it was all set
and done.

14:51.676 --> 14:54.891
Pierre Boutierre had murdered
13 men, women and children

14:54.916 --> 14:59.137
before being gunned down
in front of the hotel.

15:04.085 --> 15:08.497
But it seems Pierre is not the
only spirit in Saqwasibi.

15:08.522 --> 15:09.752
Kyle Rivera,  Ghost Attack Victim
- We don't even, you know,

15:09.777 --> 15:12.455
Kyle Rivera,  Ghost Attack Victim
- really come out here in the off season and uh.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.439
But to check on the place,
you know.

15:14.464 --> 15:16.708
You know, but you know.
Some people, you know.

15:16.733 --> 15:19.873
They've seen a big bearded man
and then he wasn't there.

15:19.898 --> 15:21.907
You know, some people said
they've seen uh.

15:21.932 --> 15:25.127
women, kids.

15:25.305 --> 15:26.895
Doors opened and shut.

15:26.930 --> 15:29.828
Sometime, you think there is
someone in the room with you.

15:29.853 --> 15:31.889
It's just...
no one there.

15:31.914 --> 15:36.889
Sometimes, you feel someone
in the hallway brushing by you.

15:36.924 --> 15:38.865
Nobody.

15:38.890 --> 15:41.199
There's nobody there.

15:41.224 --> 15:44.513
However the spirits were
never overtly hostile,

15:44.538 --> 15:46.001
until recently.

15:46.026 --> 15:48.087
Couple of months before
we called you, I was

15:48.112 --> 15:52.077
out here doing my checks
and uh.

15:52.402 --> 15:55.435
Felt like someone was
in the room with me.

15:55.460 --> 15:56.943
It knocked me down.
I got back up.

15:56.968 --> 15:59.915
It threw me down again,
and then

15:59.940 --> 16:02.368
knocked me down the stairs.

16:03.221 --> 16:04.520
Malinda Sullivan, Clairvoyant
- I hope people who experienced

16:04.545 --> 16:07.995
Malinda Sullivan, Clairvoyant
- unexplained phenomena in their home or buildings.

16:08.020 --> 16:10.348
This camp is
filled with spirits.

16:10.373 --> 16:12.756
I believe one of them is evil.

16:12.781 --> 16:15.042
So.
This is the room

16:15.067 --> 16:17.734
where you claimed to have
communicated with Pierre.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.384
Or mostly communicated about him.

16:20.409 --> 16:24.410
The other spirits seemed
tormented by Mr Boutierre.

16:24.817 --> 16:28.549
Someone's not a people person.
Heh-heh-heh.

16:28.574 --> 16:32.124
So, I asked them
what I could do and.

16:32.149 --> 16:35.028
They pleaded with me
to banish Pierre.

16:35.053 --> 16:38.384
But I have no experience dealing
 with such an evil presence.

16:38.409 --> 16:43.676
I believe he's wanting a
a direct confrontation

16:43.701 --> 16:46.253
And I'm certainly
not willing to do that.

16:46.278 --> 16:49.596
Well, you're smart.
That's why we're here.

16:49.621 --> 16:51.848
You made the right call.

16:52.938 --> 16:54.210
So, Mr George.

16:54.235 --> 16:56.958
How can "America's Most
Haunted" help you.

16:57.058 --> 17:00.358
Well, there is someone
or something

17:00.382 --> 17:03.602
that is making my staff
very uncomfortable.

17:03.638 --> 17:07.064
And it's very possible that
it is now attacking them.

17:07.089 --> 17:09.262
So you want them gone?

17:09.381 --> 17:13.354
I want them something and
I don’t give a damn what.

17:13.378 --> 17:15.242
Do you want him gone?

17:15.268 --> 17:17.994
Yup, I do.

17:18.253 --> 17:20.310
Then let's get this ghost.

17:20.335 --> 17:23.499
And with that,
we were left on our own.

17:23.523 --> 17:26.179
Short of walking 5 miles
through dense forest,

17:26.204 --> 17:28.564
we were stranded at
Saqwasibi for the night.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.576
With accommodations and
the hotel for all of us.

17:31.601 --> 17:35.942
And who knows who,
or what else.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.506
What?

17:42.530 --> 17:43.924
- Excuse me.
- Did you say something?

17:43.949 --> 17:45.618
No.

17:49.271 --> 17:52.132
Ah, here they are.

18:06.317 --> 18:09.085
- You all shoot the intro yet.
- It's finished.

18:09.110 --> 18:11.952
Oh, the squibs.
I love the squibs.

18:11.987 --> 18:14.717
Yeah. Would have been nice
having a couple of extra hands.

18:14.742 --> 18:16.207
Oh, I know.
And I'm so sorry

18:16.232 --> 18:18.175
I couldn't been
those hands for you.

18:18.200 --> 18:19.343
Why don't you come inside
and I'll show you

18:19.368 --> 18:21.433
the rest of your job
I've done.

18:21.458 --> 18:24.434
Michael, get off your ass
and give them a hand.

18:24.459 --> 18:26.514
Alright.

18:27.460 --> 18:31.727
And you. You know a little
exercise wouldn't hurt you.

18:33.251 --> 18:36.877
Look at all these hands.
Lead on, it's a hand party.

18:37.752 --> 18:39.500
I almost had a bar.

18:39.525 --> 18:41.855
Jimmy and the
new guy are here.

18:43.027 --> 18:45.918
I really hope nobody
has to reach me.

18:48.672 --> 18:51.132
So when're you
going out there?

18:51.279 --> 18:53.032
Tuesday.

18:53.056 --> 18:55.081
When's the audition?

18:55.388 --> 18:58.988
You know. The, the call back.
When is it?

18:59.086 --> 19:00.489
Wednesday or Thursday.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.453
I just know I have
to be there Tuesday.

19:05.083 --> 19:09.141
Hey, I'm, I...
I'll go with you if you want.

19:09.761 --> 19:11.461
You would go to LA?

19:11.486 --> 19:13.465
I thought you hate LA?

19:13.490 --> 19:16.801
No, I don't.
I don't hate LA. I mean.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.799
But I mean, I would go with you,
if you want me.

19:19.824 --> 19:21.564
If you want someone

19:21.589 --> 19:23.511
to go with you,
I mean I would.

19:23.536 --> 19:26.275
You know, it probably be even,
you know for me to go out there

19:26.300 --> 19:28.523
You know, check out
the city and stuff.

19:28.548 --> 19:30.599
That's really sweet.

19:32.176 --> 19:35.531
The thing is, I'm not sure
I'll be coming back, you know.

19:35.556 --> 19:37.220
Mm-Hm.

19:39.426 --> 19:41.068
Yeah.

19:42.162 --> 19:45.370
We'll pick you up in the morning.
Becareful.

19:45.396 --> 19:47.963
Thank you, Mr George.
I'm sure we'll be fine.

19:47.988 --> 19:50.875
So. You really think
you can get this ghost.

19:50.900 --> 19:53.581
Of course.
That's what we do.

19:53.606 --> 19:57.401
Well. I can't wait to
see it, Mr Falco.

19:59.943 --> 20:03.560
Okay.
See you in the morning.

20:11.718 --> 20:14.483
Alright, nobody at home,
set it there.

20:14.508 --> 20:17.120
Oh thanks.
Looks cosy.

20:17.145 --> 20:18.997
Does anybody has cell service?

20:19.021 --> 20:20.495
Coming to get us in
the morning, Emily.

20:20.526 --> 20:22.257
- I'm sure you'll be okay.
- I'm fine.

20:22.282 --> 20:24.631
Okay, so we have the old
original hotel over there.

20:24.667 --> 20:27.572
It looks really great. There's a
lot of great location we can get

20:27.597 --> 20:30.485
most of the show in the can,
in a couple of different spots.

20:30.510 --> 20:32.199
We can do some ghost lights.
We can do uh

20:32.224 --> 20:34.109
some door gags,
we can do some mist.

20:34.134 --> 20:35.650
There's some good
opportunities for

20:35.675 --> 20:37.567
some obscure figures
behind corners.

20:37.592 --> 20:39.177
Yeah, I'll look around.
See what I can find.

20:39.207 --> 20:42.315
- I have a question. Sorry?
- Go ahead.

20:43.198 --> 20:44.866
Guys, take a look at this place.

20:44.891 --> 20:46.568
Don't you guys think there's
actually a chance that

20:46.593 --> 20:50.299
you might catch something
real on camera.

20:51.501 --> 20:52.828
Real?

20:52.854 --> 20:54.686
Real ghost.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.363
I mean this place
has to be haunted.

20:56.388 --> 20:59.485
You know,
it may very well be.

20:59.510 --> 21:02.844
But ghost don't typically follow
production schedule very well.

21:02.869 --> 21:04.390
We're only here for 1 night.

21:04.415 --> 21:06.151
And we can't expect
ghosts just show up

21:06.176 --> 21:08.114
because we happen to
be here in shooting.

21:08.139 --> 21:11.784
Not to say that they're not here.
'cos they maybe here.

21:12.010 --> 21:14.036
Mad respect.

21:14.061 --> 21:18.953
But, it's just highly unlikely that
they'll pose for pictures, that's all.

21:18.978 --> 21:22.587
You seemed disappointed.
You wanted them to be real?

21:22.707 --> 21:25.280
I kinda hoped
but I figured that.

21:25.305 --> 21:27.576
Let's hope we packed
ham and cheese for lunch.

21:27.601 --> 21:29.142
That's my hope.

21:29.167 --> 21:32.777
I mean. We've caught
real stuff before, right?

21:37.384 --> 21:40.887
We were warned that the
spirits in this house hate books.

21:40.912 --> 21:44.234
Then, there's the thing
with the toy train moving.

21:46.164 --> 21:48.496
Of course we did have to
shoot it for like 7 hours

21:48.521 --> 21:50.554
and speed the footage up
like 500%

21:50.579 --> 21:52.206
so you can actually tell
that it was moving.

21:52.231 --> 21:54.176
What we've learned
over the years is that

21:54.206 --> 21:56.976
patiently and respectfully
waiting for ghost

21:57.001 --> 21:59.995
to appear just
makes for bad TV.

22:00.020 --> 22:02.040
Even worse,
boring TV.

22:02.065 --> 22:03.987
If we're going to stand
out among the millions of

22:04.012 --> 22:07.476
ghost huntings, spirit whispering
paranormal shows

22:07.501 --> 22:08.804
With lots of ghosts.

22:08.828 --> 22:11.569
I mean I think we've a really
great fake ghost show.

22:11.594 --> 22:13.843
Jimmy does a great job
making fake ghost.

22:13.867 --> 22:18.265
Thank you, darling.
It's nice to be appreciated.

22:18.290 --> 22:21.737
We're on the same page here,
conceptually?

22:22.592 --> 22:23.614
Yes.

22:23.639 --> 22:26.410
Okay! Let's rig up
this old crap shack.

22:26.435 --> 22:29.548
We hurry up, we can have this
whole show in the can by midnight.

22:29.574 --> 22:33.713
Careful with her, boys.
She's a lady of age and distinction.

22:33.882 --> 22:36.042
Why're you all
still sitting here?

22:51.201 --> 22:53.206
While encounters had been
reported from almost

22:53.231 --> 22:55.746
 every location in and
around the hotel

22:55.771 --> 22:58.280
There was definitely
a consensus on locations

22:58.305 --> 23:02.076
where the evil presence
seemed to be concentrated.

23:41.978 --> 23:43.501
With our cameras in place,

23:43.531 --> 23:46.320
ghost and EMF monitors,
on and active

23:46.345 --> 23:48.172
and our dedicated crew ready.

23:48.202 --> 23:50.132
We were sure that this
would be the last night

23:50.157 --> 23:54.870
Pierre Boutierre was going to
spend in the Saqwasibi hotel.

24:14.185 --> 24:16.370
Incoming.

24:18.417 --> 24:19.739
Okay, everybody...whoa.

24:19.780 --> 24:21.766
- Something's down there.
- Yeah.

24:23.750 --> 24:26.386
Yeah. I think we spit up
and...

24:26.411 --> 24:28.090
I don't know, try to
get the big stuff first

24:28.115 --> 24:29.709
and then just fill
in what we need

24:29.734 --> 24:31.214
Yeah, let's split up.

24:31.239 --> 24:36.475
Me and Scotty will stay upstairs,
and Rob and Emily downstairs.

24:37.665 --> 24:40.548
- Lock the doors up here
- Door gag, got it.

24:40.573 --> 24:42.272
Basically, it's simple version.

24:42.297 --> 24:43.448
We'll find the ghost.

24:43.473 --> 24:46.186
Drive him downstairs into that room,
And expel him.

24:46.210 --> 24:48.806
Okay, so just uh
I send it downstairs.

24:48.831 --> 24:51.070
Oh yeah. Actually that's good.
That mean that would be cool

24:51.095 --> 24:53.444
because that's where the trials
are placed or whatever.

24:53.469 --> 24:55.667
You know. Maybe you're down there,
you're rolling you hear something.

24:55.707 --> 24:56.715
Play it up.

24:56.740 --> 24:58.824
Do we have surveillance
in that room?

24:58.849 --> 25:02.401
Yeah, I got a camera in there,
1 in the main hallway there.

25:02.498 --> 25:03.701
1 in the stairway
we just came up

25:03.725 --> 25:06.332
and 1 in the back stairs where
the kid got pushed or whatever.

25:06.357 --> 25:08.765
- Great.
- Uh, ghost light on the stairs?

25:08.790 --> 25:11.202
Yeah, that's good.
Let's set...

25:11.350 --> 25:13.167
Heh-heh.

25:18.768 --> 25:20.882
See, that's what I'm
talking about.  Right.

25:20.915 --> 25:22.707
Ancient old building like this.

25:22.762 --> 25:25.419
It should make noises like this all night
and do our job for us.

25:25.444 --> 25:27.004
You roll in on that,
you hear something,

25:27.029 --> 25:28.851
you play it up, there's
you segment. Done.

25:28.876 --> 25:30.211
- Cool.
- Let's get to work.

25:30.236 --> 25:34.197
- Always rolling. Always rolling.
- Right.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.599
So uh, I don't think
Emily is coming back.

26:11.624 --> 26:13.360
Yeah.

26:14.190 --> 26:15.884
I think Rob's thinking
about leaving too.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.259
Wait, what?
What makes you think that?

26:18.284 --> 26:21.133
He's got it for her bad.
He wants to go with her.

26:21.158 --> 26:23.178
Rob?
What.

26:23.203 --> 26:26.405
I don't think the feeling is mutual.
Emily is never uh.

26:26.430 --> 26:28.622
What about you?

26:28.855 --> 26:30.316
What about me?

26:30.341 --> 26:32.462
Come on.
I think we all had it for it.

26:32.487 --> 26:34.733
One point or another
over the years.

26:34.796 --> 26:38.437
And you do know she's the reason
our audience watches the show, right?

26:38.462 --> 26:40.484
You don't really think that?

26:40.509 --> 26:42.553
Look at her.
Look at her and then.

26:42.578 --> 26:44.164
Remember what it was
like to be 16 years old

26:44.189 --> 26:46.982
and stone and horny.
Sitting down on your parents' couch.

26:47.015 --> 26:49.672
watching stupid television
shows all night.

26:49.697 --> 26:51.560
Yeah, she's why they watched.

26:51.585 --> 26:55.611
Scotty, that can't be
the only reason.

26:55.803 --> 26:57.291
Wanna bet?

26:57.316 --> 26:59.043
She's going to LA.
She's going to get that show.

26:59.068 --> 27:00.798
And then we'll find out,
won't we.

27:00.823 --> 27:04.917
Alright, okay.
Let's say you're right.

27:04.942 --> 27:06.462
What's the plan?

27:06.487 --> 27:08.827
Reinvent ourselves.
Reinvent the show.

27:08.852 --> 27:12.753
Make the show we said we were
gonna make when we started, right?

27:12.778 --> 27:15.781
And when that doesn't work.
Find a new hobby.

27:16.834 --> 27:20.701
- Hey, you guys like this door?
- Yeah it looks good from here.

27:21.280 --> 27:25.630
Yeah, I like this door.
It's a good door.

27:36.897 --> 27:38.373
Better.

27:38.939 --> 27:42.021
Still scary,
but better.

27:44.545 --> 27:47.794
Okay. This should be in
frame don't you think?

27:47.819 --> 27:49.660
Oh yeah, yeah totally.
Those things are so wide

27:49.691 --> 27:52.346
this whole room is
probably in frame. So.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.594
I was probably.
Let's do something in fable.

27:54.619 --> 27:56.965
We'll sit. You sit on the couch.
I'll sit in the chair.

27:56.990 --> 27:58.993
Yeah, maybe gen
a little scene first.

27:59.018 --> 28:00.903
Yeah, yeah.
Like brain in the middle is good.

28:00.928 --> 28:02.632
Okay.
Cool.

28:03.386 --> 28:06.710
- Okay, Jimmy?
- Yeah.

28:06.869 --> 28:09.136
Can you hear me like this
or do we need a signal?

28:09.161 --> 28:10.217
Yeah.

28:10.242 --> 28:12.809
Yes, you can hear me or
yes, you need a signal?

28:12.834 --> 28:14.092
Yeah, I can hear you.

28:14.117 --> 28:16.156
What if we talk a
little quieter like this?

28:16.181 --> 28:17.469
Barely.

28:17.493 --> 28:20.853
Okay. We're gonna do an
it's getting cold talk.

28:20.878 --> 28:22.606
And then you slam the door.

28:22.631 --> 28:24.515
- Slam it?
- That's right.

28:24.547 --> 28:26.787
- You got it?
- Cold talk, slam it, copy.

28:26.812 --> 28:28.097
Okay.

28:28.122 --> 28:30.247
- You ready?
- Yeah.

28:30.272 --> 28:32.373
- Good to go.
- I'm gonna walk in the frame.

28:32.398 --> 28:33.822
Okay.

28:34.670 --> 28:36.358
Alright.

28:39.065 --> 28:42.523
And...
action.

28:43.127 --> 28:46.518
This hallway is one of the main
concentrations of the haunting.

28:46.543 --> 28:49.376
We've been hearing things
up here all night.

28:50.261 --> 28:52.409
Cut, Jimmy!

28:52.434 --> 28:54.308
- What?
- You're early, buddy.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.108
Yeah, I can't hear you
at all in there.

28:56.133 --> 28:58.322
That's why I asked, Jimmy.

28:58.347 --> 29:00.341
- Can you hear me right now?
- Yes.

29:00.366 --> 29:02.376
Go in the room.

29:03.552 --> 29:06.236
- Can you still hear me?
- Yes.

29:06.261 --> 29:09.548
Okay, remember.
Cold talk.

29:10.986 --> 29:14.088
- You said "Cold talk".
- You're hilarious.

29:14.113 --> 29:18.069
I like the ghost Bette 'cause
you're dead on the inside.

29:19.582 --> 29:22.334
Okay.
Take 2.

29:26.022 --> 29:27.821
Action.

29:27.846 --> 29:30.857
This hallway is one of the main
concentrations of the haunting.

29:30.882 --> 29:33.983
We've been hearing things
up here all night.

29:36.140 --> 29:37.804
It's.  It's almost like
something feel

29:37.830 --> 29:39.586
It feels like something
is up here, you know?

29:39.633 --> 29:42.055
Yeah, I know what you mean.
I've like sometime in my stomach.

29:42.080 --> 29:43.628
Like a, I feel,
I feel sick, dude.

29:43.653 --> 29:47.245
You know just when you said that,
I started feeling really nauseous.

29:50.058 --> 29:52.023
Whoa. Whoa.

29:52.048 --> 29:54.711
Are you kidding. Are you kidding.
Are you cold.

29:54.736 --> 29:58.526
Freezing. It's like the temperature
just dropped like 10 degrees.

29:58.686 --> 30:00.421
What was that?

30:10.222 --> 30:12.636
Did.
Did you get all that?

30:16.264 --> 30:18.598
- Nice door gag.
- Yeah.

30:19.087 --> 30:21.143
Okay.
So.

30:21.168 --> 30:23.044
Alright, I'll start with the
intro of the room.

30:23.069 --> 30:25.993
You know. This is where the trial
was held and blah blah blah.

30:26.018 --> 30:28.036
And uh.
Then take our seats.

30:28.061 --> 30:30.803
And go ahead and lead in
with "Did you feel that."

30:30.828 --> 30:32.307
- And then we'll go from there.
- Yeah sure.

30:32.332 --> 30:35.965
You just start talking. I'll do a
little pan around the room and...

30:35.990 --> 30:38.376
- Ready?
- Yup, how's my hair?

30:40.079 --> 30:43.802
It's... It's good.
So, alright.

30:44.322 --> 30:46.194
Night vision.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.593
OH!
Uh.

30:48.618 --> 30:49.672
What?

30:49.697 --> 30:52.187
I, I don't know.
I thought, I thought I saw someone.

30:52.212 --> 30:53.833
- Was it me?
- No! No, no.

30:53.858 --> 30:55.559
It was other, other than you.
Like, right behind you. Like...

30:55.584 --> 30:57.646
- Shut up.
- real, when I turned
the night vision on it.

30:57.671 --> 30:59.344
Just, real quick.

30:59.369 --> 31:00.757
- Nobody's there.
- I mean. Yeah, I know.

31:00.782 --> 31:02.569
I wouldn't. Not now!
Nobody's there.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.513
But I mean it.
Just real quick, there were...

31:04.538 --> 31:07.329
- Well, who was it?
- I don't, I don't know? Be...

31:07.354 --> 31:10.223
Crazy ghost or just.
Never mind, maybe it's...

31:10.248 --> 31:11.622
Well, rewind it.
Let me see.

31:11.647 --> 31:12.805
I...

31:12.830 --> 31:15.172
I wasn't recording.

31:15.262 --> 31:16.598
Dude!

31:16.623 --> 31:19.826
- Press "Record".
- Okay, alright.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.656
There's definitely
something up here.

31:25.681 --> 31:27.947
Every door in this hallway
just slammed shut.

31:27.972 --> 31:29.761
That was crazy.

31:30.104 --> 31:31.900
What was that?

31:33.006 --> 31:34.768
I don't know. There's...
There's something in that room.

31:34.793 --> 31:36.597
Shh, shh, shh.

31:37.030 --> 31:39.047
Hello.

31:40.072 --> 31:42.342
Is someone up here with us?

31:45.616 --> 31:47.640
- Hey, you guys hear that?
- Jimmy, what the hell.

31:47.665 --> 31:50.099
- Did you guys hear that?
- Yeah.

31:50.124 --> 31:53.170
- What was it?
- There's something in
the room with me, man.

31:53.195 --> 31:56.732
- How did you get there?
- Oh yeah. Check this out.

31:59.702 --> 32:02.653
See, there's a door between this 2 rooms.

32:03.570 --> 32:06.229
These lumberjacks were swingers

32:06.254 --> 32:09.033
- Serious, there was something in the room.
- Yeah, what?

32:09.058 --> 32:10.690
I don't know.
I didn't stick around to find out.

32:10.715 --> 32:14.063
You do it.
Get that ghost.

32:14.628 --> 32:17.622
- Okay, Scotty?
- Yup, almost.

32:17.647 --> 32:19.575
Let me know.

32:19.600 --> 32:20.980
Alright.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.434
- Jimmy.
- Yeah, chief.

32:23.751 --> 32:26.216
- Get off camera.
- Oh, that's right.

32:27.665 --> 32:29.279
Okay.

32:30.037 --> 32:31.579
We found the door
in this room that

32:31.604 --> 32:34.114
leads to the room where
we heard all the noise.

32:34.139 --> 32:36.231
We're going to check it out.

32:39.533 --> 32:41.585
It's quiet now.

32:41.702 --> 32:43.476
Look at the bed.

32:43.501 --> 32:45.493
Yeah, the dresser too.

32:47.458 --> 32:50.115
Someone was in here
and it wasn't any of us.

32:50.140 --> 32:54.031
- Rob and Emily aren't up here right?
- Nope, they are downstairs.

32:55.013 --> 32:58.636
We just went though this place
an hour ago, it didn't look like this.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.539
Hello.

33:05.802 --> 33:07.974
Is there anybody here?

33:08.900 --> 33:11.936
Is there anyone here
that wants to talk to us?

33:12.237 --> 33:14.651
We really want to talk to you.

33:16.498 --> 33:19.211
We saw what you
did with this room.

33:20.688 --> 33:23.138
Just give us a sign
that you're here.

33:24.212 --> 33:26.587
Can you move the bed again?

33:28.814 --> 33:30.674
Come on, give us a sign
that you're here.

33:30.699 --> 33:34.053
Anything.
How about the dresser?

33:35.605 --> 33:38.406
Can you move the dresser again?

33:39.164 --> 33:40.543
Just move the dresser.

33:40.568 --> 33:42.788
- Do you want me to move the dresser.
- Cut.

33:42.813 --> 33:45.214
- Dude, what are you doing?
- 'Cause I can crawl over there and move the.

33:45.239 --> 33:47.226
So, James.
You didn't do any of this.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.755
- That's what you're telling me?
- That's what I'm saying.

33:48.780 --> 33:52.191
Someone else left
the furniture like this.

33:53.011 --> 33:56.593
Alright, if that's true, I don't know
what's going on but I like it.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.977
You got all the doors stuff and
the noise coming from this room.

34:01.002 --> 34:04.563
Yeah, I got it, and the surveillance
camera at the end of the hall got it.

34:04.932 --> 34:06.830
We should probably
set a camera up in here.

34:06.855 --> 34:08.137
Yeah, there is an extra
we can set up.

34:08.161 --> 34:11.288
So is that a
break for lunch.

34:11.313 --> 34:14.328
- You tired? Jesus.
- I'm hungry

34:14.353 --> 34:17.478
- Okay, let's take a break.
- Alright.

34:25.179 --> 34:27.132
Guys, come here.

34:28.159 --> 34:29.728
Look.

34:38.123 --> 34:39.795
What was that?

34:39.820 --> 34:42.368
What.
What was what?

34:42.904 --> 34:45.935
It's been happening
a couple of minutes now.

34:47.208 --> 34:49.232
There he is again.

34:52.663 --> 34:54.984
- I'm not seeing anything.
- What?

34:55.009 --> 34:57.100
Yeah, I'm not seeing anything.

35:02.346 --> 35:04.377
Did you see it,
that type.

35:04.410 --> 35:07.296
- Rob. You are recording, right?
- Yes.

35:07.945 --> 35:09.689
Yes.

35:10.105 --> 35:12.528
I'm not seeing him
in my camera.

35:16.678 --> 35:18.625
Oh my gosh.

35:21.594 --> 35:23.576
What is he doing?

35:25.165 --> 35:27.239
He's looking at us.

35:33.041 --> 35:35.823
Oh shit, Leon.
Talk to him, try talk to him.

35:35.848 --> 35:37.349
- Okay, yeah.
- Yeah.

35:37.374 --> 35:39.501
Go talk to him.

35:52.275 --> 35:54.009
Hello.

35:54.034 --> 35:55.676
- My name is Leon.
- Shit!   - Oh.

35:55.701 --> 35:58.189
- What? What, he's not there anymore?
- He's gone

35:58.214 --> 36:00.947
- No.
- You scared it away.

36:01.484 --> 36:03.377
Damn it.
What now?

36:03.402 --> 36:04.654
- I'm still hungry.
- Yeah.

36:04.679 --> 36:06.007
And if this kind of stuff
is going to be happening

36:06.032 --> 36:07.253
we should get the
other camera set up.

36:07.278 --> 36:09.704
And we better be well fed for it.
Let's get sandwiches.

36:09.729 --> 36:12.234
Kidding.
It's your call.

36:14.675 --> 36:16.020
Okay, go, go.
Yeah.

36:16.045 --> 36:19.100
- Yes, sandwiches.
- I'm down with that.

36:20.457 --> 36:22.909
- What was that?
- I don't know.

36:26.885 --> 36:28.499
It's got to be something
with the night vision.

36:28.524 --> 36:31.502
- One of the infrared, maybe.
- Hey, let's lunch.

36:31.527 --> 36:33.113
Okay.

36:33.886 --> 36:35.409
Okay.

36:37.042 --> 36:39.075
Okay, there's something
really going on here.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.601
- Yeah, no kidding.
- Uh. What're you guys talking about?

36:41.626 --> 36:43.392
Just all the ghost,
all over the place.

36:43.417 --> 36:44.636
Like, real ghost?

36:44.676 --> 36:46.188
That one you guys saw
wasn't the only one.

36:46.213 --> 36:48.245
I mean, before you
came down,  I swear

36:48.270 --> 36:51.161
- I saw something right behind Emily.
- Right behind me.

36:51.186 --> 36:54.709
I mean it was really quick though.
You look in the view finder and it was gone.

36:54.734 --> 36:56.566
- Did you see that one?
- Uh-uh.

36:56.591 --> 36:59.145
I... I wasn't rolling.

37:01.241 --> 37:04.292
Okay, so it's an artist camp.
Right?

37:05.265 --> 37:09.699
While these, pictures of Pierre
and portraits around.

37:11.696 --> 37:16.795
A portrait is a profound interaction
between the artist and subject.

37:16.825 --> 37:20.831
Often capturing a piece of the
subject's soul in the process.

37:20.856 --> 37:24.000
All these pictures and
paintings around it

37:24.025 --> 37:25.373
All these souls trapped here.

37:25.398 --> 37:27.788
They must be channeling
all this activity.

37:27.812 --> 37:29.193
Really?

37:29.218 --> 37:32.166
Hey Leon. How much of that
did you just make up?

37:32.191 --> 37:34.745
All of it. All of it. I'm just
trying to find the angle here.

37:34.770 --> 37:36.592
Did you guys remembered
the mustard?

37:36.617 --> 37:39.113
Okay, just wait a second.
So I mean.

37:39.138 --> 37:41.629
I don't know if you guys
are messing with me or.

37:41.654 --> 37:44.546
If you're seeing any
actual real ghost then

37:44.571 --> 37:46.183
maybe that lady was right.

37:46.219 --> 37:48.168
Wait, what lady?

37:48.309 --> 37:52.034
I don't know. The clairvoyant lady
or whatever you called her.

37:52.523 --> 37:54.669
Maybe, yeah why?

37:54.694 --> 37:57.632
Well, I don't know I mean.
She said that she talked to it.

37:57.657 --> 38:00.434
 And if things get real out of hand.

38:00.582 --> 38:03.671
- Got this baby.
- "Ghost burst". Right.

38:03.696 --> 38:06.587
Alright, okay so,
first things first.

38:06.612 --> 38:09.014
We need to get more
of this stuff on camera.

38:09.039 --> 38:11.505
That means rolling.
Always, always rolling.

38:11.530 --> 38:13.441
Want me to take the
camera up to room 9.

38:13.466 --> 38:16.009
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. You want help?
- No, I got it. Um.

38:16.051 --> 38:19.140
I  think I left my bag of
mustard up there anyway.

38:19.165 --> 38:21.950
I don't want to get all the ghost
before Leon scares them away.

38:21.975 --> 38:25.838
- Jimmy, becareful.
- Hey, careful is my middle name.

38:25.878 --> 38:29.602
- No, it isn't.
- No, it isn't.

38:30.109 --> 38:33.846
Shh, shh.
You guys hear that.

38:36.587 --> 38:38.494
Hear what?

38:39.231 --> 38:41.164
No, no. Never mind.
Listen.

38:41.194 --> 38:43.357
We, okay. So we all get
cameras. We all split up.

38:43.382 --> 38:45.171
Make sure you're
 set to night vision.

38:45.196 --> 38:47.958
Because for some reason
they showed up on night vision.

38:47.983 --> 38:50.373
We'll just have to.

38:51.510 --> 38:53.166
Leon.

38:53.909 --> 38:56.056
Yes.
Right, split up.

38:56.081 --> 38:58.061
I'll take the back hallway.

38:58.673 --> 39:01.010
- Do I get a camera?
- No, no. You stay here.

39:01.035 --> 39:03.975
This is headquarters. You just
sit tight. You'll be fine.

39:04.004 --> 39:07.215
Yeah, sure.
I'll be fine.

39:18.883 --> 39:22.906
Hello ghosts.
Where're you gonna be.

39:29.191 --> 39:31.047
Whoa.

39:56.711 --> 39:58.321
Whoa!

41:18.400 --> 41:21.136
Shit. Shit. Shit.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.566
- You got your night vision on?
- Yeah.

43:24.591 --> 43:27.344
Creepy ghost vision on.

43:27.369 --> 43:29.730
- Raah.
- God.

43:29.755 --> 43:32.322
Oh my god.
You should have seen your face.

47:14.029 --> 47:15.907
Scotty!

47:46.838 --> 47:48.632
Aw.

48:32.420 --> 48:34.897
So, uh.
Are you seeing anything?

48:34.922 --> 48:37.521
Just know I'll let you know.

48:39.465 --> 48:42.164
Maybe we should just
go back to the main room.

48:48.712 --> 48:50.946
Oh.

48:59.906 --> 49:02.783
That door just open while
we were standing here.

49:02.808 --> 49:05.026
Yes, it did.

49:07.504 --> 49:10.504
You think something
wants us to go in there?

49:10.529 --> 49:12.730
I think you're right.

49:14.897 --> 49:16.621
Okay.

49:17.851 --> 49:19.633
Okay.

49:38.417 --> 49:39.888
Oh my god.

49:39.913 --> 49:42.871
Now they're out there. It's like.
It's like they're messing with us.

49:46.283 --> 49:48.436
- Emily?
- Oh my god.

49:48.461 --> 49:50.485
- Emily?
- Rob.

49:54.687 --> 49:57.250
Emily. The door is
locked or something.

49:57.275 --> 50:00.379
I don't.
I don't see a lock, Rob.

50:00.662 --> 50:02.144
There isn't a lock.

50:02.169 --> 50:05.985
Somehow it locked.
Just relax.

50:06.074 --> 50:08.194
I mean, I'll get something
to open the door.

50:08.229 --> 50:10.134
I can't open it.

50:10.174 --> 50:13.968
Just, just hang tight.
I'll be right back with something.

50:14.181 --> 50:16.232
Come right back.

50:17.715 --> 50:21.070
Okay.
Just.

50:21.095 --> 50:22.742
Okay.

50:31.956 --> 50:34.092
Oh god.

51:48.039 --> 51:50.451
What's going on?

52:38.997 --> 52:41.176
What do you want?

53:17.018 --> 53:19.595
Of course you want me
to go down there.

54:04.923 --> 54:08.196
(Thou... shall...)

54:18.699 --> 54:21.161
(get... out...)

54:27.432 --> 54:30.226
Heh-heh-heh.
Heh-heh-heh.

54:30.251 --> 54:33.053
Oh, come on!

54:51.704 --> 54:54.006
What are you doing?

54:54.031 --> 54:55.941
Oh. I just.

54:56.299 --> 54:58.584
Did you hear something?

54:58.626 --> 55:00.342
What did you hear?

55:00.368 --> 55:04.209
Voices, you know.
Typical haunted house stuff.

55:04.234 --> 55:07.524
Yeah, I heard... stuff.

55:08.214 --> 55:10.820
- So, this is kind of unusual huh.
- What?

55:10.845 --> 55:15.599
Like. You don't experienced as much
activity on a normal shoot

55:15.624 --> 55:18.137
Honestly.
No.

55:18.162 --> 55:22.110
Never seen anything
like this before.

55:22.543 --> 55:25.863
Okay.
Okay.

55:25.888 --> 55:30.696
You still think we're, you know.
Safe, right?

55:31.152 --> 55:33.919
I think, I think so.
Isn't this what you were hoping for.

55:33.944 --> 55:36.966
Uh, yes. Yes, this is cool.
Don't get me wrong.

55:37.006 --> 55:40.166
It's just that, you know.
I'm a little creep out in here, that's all.

55:40.191 --> 55:44.575
- Well, it's creepier out there.
- Okay. I'll come with you.

55:45.493 --> 55:48.199
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

55:48.224 --> 55:51.291
Rather not,
sit in here alone anymore.

55:52.542 --> 55:54.099
Okay.

55:55.547 --> 55:58.496
- Stay off camera.
- Okay.

56:38.488 --> 56:41.454
No, no, no.
No, no, no...

57:19.766 --> 57:21.718
- Leon?
- God!

57:21.743 --> 57:23.491
Scotty.

57:23.516 --> 57:25.828
- What're you doing up here?
- Is he gone?

57:25.853 --> 57:28.609
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Are you okay?

57:28.647 --> 57:32.769
Oh man, look at this, dude.
Look what he did.

57:32.794 --> 57:35.200
- Wow.
- Did you get it.

57:35.225 --> 57:38.326
Here.  I thought
I was going to die, dude.

57:38.351 --> 57:39.842
Can you get up?

57:39.867 --> 57:41.871
Oh yeah, I can get up.

57:41.896 --> 57:44.381
Look, we have to
find Rob and Emily.

57:44.406 --> 57:45.732
Are you sure he's gone?

57:45.757 --> 57:47.403
Yeah, I mean, I think so.

57:47.428 --> 57:51.480
I mean I haven't seen him at all
since you, you know, since he...

57:51.505 --> 57:54.355
Hey, to be fair. He had an axe.
I didn't have anything.

57:54.380 --> 57:56.853
- Oh yeah. He's kind of going for you.
-  Like this.

57:56.878 --> 57:58.446
Yeah.

58:09.439 --> 58:11.815
<i>(Hide...)</i>

59:08.796 --> 59:10.188
Emily.

59:10.213 --> 59:12.517
Go, go, go.
I'll be right behind you.

59:22.293 --> 59:25.461
- Leon! This way.
- Hi.

59:29.998 --> 59:31.815
Emily.

59:36.446 --> 59:38.630
- Emily?
- Where is she?

59:38.655 --> 59:41.769
- She was in here.
- Where were you?

59:41.801 --> 59:43.414
She got locked in here.
I went to go get something

59:43.439 --> 59:45.599
- to open the door.
- Hey.

59:45.624 --> 59:47.838
Keep it down.

59:48.230 --> 59:49.730
What happen?

59:49.755 --> 59:52.464
- Why did you scream?
- It wasn't me.

59:53.678 --> 59:57.208
I was in here under the bed
and there was a girl.

59:57.233 --> 59:59.198
She told me to hide and

59:59.223 --> 01:00:01.352
- some guy came in.
- Pierre.

01:00:01.377 --> 01:00:03.546
And he saw me.

01:00:03.707 --> 01:00:06.141
Then she screamed and
she ran out of the room

01:00:06.166 --> 01:00:09.431
- and he chased her.
- Are you okay?

01:00:09.872 --> 01:00:11.497
I'm fine.

01:00:11.522 --> 01:00:13.321
It's Pierre.

01:00:13.437 --> 01:00:17.608
Pierre?
You mean like, Pierre Boutierre?

01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:20.119
What're you doing here?

01:00:20.144 --> 01:00:22.505
Me? What are real
ghost doing here?

01:00:22.530 --> 01:00:24.240
- Look. I was told when I first started.
- Wait

01:00:24.265 --> 01:00:26.439
Where's Scotty?

01:00:27.758 --> 01:00:29.559
Hey guys.

01:00:29.875 --> 01:00:32.539
Okay.
Um.

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:35.269
Where's Jimmy?

01:00:36.684 --> 01:00:39.387
No, seriously.
Has anyone seen Jimmy?

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:42.537
He went up to that room.

01:00:51.678 --> 01:00:53.773
Jimmy?

01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:10.216
I'll check the other room.

01:01:12.385 --> 01:01:15.423
- What happened in here?
- Ghost.

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:19.606
Yeah, he's probably
just messing with us.

01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:23.284
He's not over there and
he's not anywhere in the hallway.

01:01:23.309 --> 01:01:26.571
It's not like Jimmy to leave
gear laying around like that.

01:01:26.596 --> 01:01:28.343
Well, there is his
backup mustard.

01:01:28.368 --> 01:01:30.905
He wouldn't leave the
building without that.

01:01:35.225 --> 01:01:37.327
- Are you sure this isn't in the show?
- No

01:01:37.352 --> 01:01:39.590
- No, it isn't or no, you're not sure?
- No, it isn't.

01:01:39.615 --> 01:01:41.235
- Did you find him?
- No, nothing.

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:43.113
We walked further than
Jimmy would have walked.

01:01:43.138 --> 01:01:44.943
- He's not here.
- Well, if he's here.

01:01:44.983 --> 01:01:46.460
he's set us up 
for a good scare.

01:01:46.485 --> 01:01:47.930
Because we didn't 
see him anywhere.

01:01:47.955 --> 01:01:49.390
Well, maybe we
should just stay here.

01:01:49.415 --> 01:01:52.179
No. No, no.
We've to go back over there.

01:01:52.204 --> 01:01:53.512
I mean. I think
we have to, don't we?

01:01:53.537 --> 01:01:54.618
Well, what about Jimmy?

01:01:54.643 --> 01:01:57.085
He's got to be in the
hotel still somewhere.

01:01:57.110 --> 01:01:58.532
No.
We should go back over.

01:01:58.557 --> 01:02:01.661
We should wait for him and
we should finish the show!

01:02:01.686 --> 01:02:04.309
Might as well. They're not coming
back till the morning anyway.

01:02:04.334 --> 01:02:05.642
Those ghost ain't gonna
shoot themselves.

01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:07.277
See!  That's the
attitude I'm looking for.

01:02:07.302 --> 01:02:08.937
And Scotty took an axe
to the chest.

01:02:08.962 --> 01:02:10.522
- What! - What!
- Well, a ghost axe.

01:02:10.547 --> 01:02:13.038
Yeah, still hurts.
Look, you guys.

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:15.163
Pierre did that?

01:02:15.188 --> 01:02:18.111
- Yeah, yeah, upstairs.
- But I thought he was a ghost.

01:02:18.136 --> 01:02:20.780
Yeah, he's a ghost
exactly but he did that.

01:02:20.805 --> 01:02:23.035
I think we need to think
about leaving, you guys.

01:02:23.060 --> 01:02:24.392
On the contrary.

01:02:24.417 --> 01:02:27.130
What!
Leon, look!

01:02:27.155 --> 01:02:29.084
They can physically hurt us.

01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:32.474
Yeah, I have to admit that sort
of changes the game a little bit.

01:02:32.499 --> 01:02:34.019
You guys.

01:02:34.044 --> 01:02:36.957
- Scotty's okay. Alright.
- That's not funny.

01:02:36.982 --> 01:02:38.809
Besides. I don't think
they can kill us.

01:02:38.834 --> 01:02:40.806
Oh, you don't think
they can kill us.

01:02:40.831 --> 01:02:45.531
Right. Because they, you know.
They're... cause of different...

01:02:45.556 --> 01:02:47.666
You know, I can't even
make anything up right now.

01:02:47.691 --> 01:02:49.302
I mean. Maybe they can kill us.
I don't know.

01:02:49.327 --> 01:02:51.483
Alright, well.
Jimmy's missing, presume dead.

01:02:51.508 --> 01:02:53.418
- Whoa! We're presuming he's dead.
- Yeah.

01:02:53.443 --> 01:02:55.162
Isn't this something we
should decide as a group.

01:02:55.194 --> 01:02:58.121
Just because we didn't find him,
doesn't mean he's dead.

01:02:58.146 --> 01:02:59.663
Em.

01:02:59.688 --> 01:03:01.477
Give us this last one.

01:03:01.502 --> 01:03:03.379
Then you can leave
without feeling bad.

01:03:03.404 --> 01:03:05.744
Who says I feel bad.

01:03:07.356 --> 01:03:10.028
Look.
We cannot run from this.

01:03:10.061 --> 01:03:12.537
I mean, how pathetic is it that
we have a ghost hunting show.

01:03:12.562 --> 01:03:16.370
and when we actually encounter
a real ghost we want to run away.

01:03:16.395 --> 01:03:18.454
- Why would I feel bad, Leon?
- Fine, you don't.

01:03:18.479 --> 01:03:21.991
Just finish this show with us.

01:03:22.143 --> 01:03:25.309
This is why we all started doing
this in the first place. Isn't it?

01:03:25.341 --> 01:03:29.160
You think I feel guilty
for taking the other show.

01:03:29.278 --> 01:03:31.077
Wait. You mean
going to the call back.

01:03:31.105 --> 01:03:33.098
She's already got it.

01:03:34.197 --> 01:03:35.829
What?

01:03:36.165 --> 01:03:38.415
Emily.
Look.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.260
You're beautiful.
You're talented.

01:03:41.285 --> 01:03:43.254
You're strong.
You got a great personality.

01:03:43.279 --> 01:03:45.028
You're going to be
very very famous.

01:03:45.053 --> 01:03:46.745
And I love you very much.

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:48.575
We all do.

01:03:48.856 --> 01:03:50.356
And for a second,
I need

01:03:50.381 --> 01:03:52.104
every one of you guys
to try to remember

01:03:52.129 --> 01:03:54.666
why we started doing
this in the first place.

01:03:54.691 --> 01:03:56.929
Because we actually
believe in this stuff.

01:03:56.954 --> 01:03:58.298
And now, here it is.

01:03:58.323 --> 01:04:00.452
You guys aren't
mad at me, are you?

01:04:00.477 --> 01:04:03.101
I couldn't take it
if you guys hated me.

01:04:03.126 --> 01:04:05.795
Nobody hates you Em.
How could we.

01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:07.677
Yeah.
Yeah, you.

01:04:07.702 --> 01:04:09.698
You got to do what
you got to do.

01:04:11.422 --> 01:04:14.395
Well. Would be kind
of a cool way to go out.

01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:16.417
Good! Alright.
I got a plan.

01:04:16.442 --> 01:04:17.867
Well, I hope so.

01:04:17.892 --> 01:04:19.706
Now, first I.
I can't explain everything.

01:04:19.731 --> 01:04:21.703
I just need you
guys to trust me.

01:04:21.728 --> 01:04:24.342
And I need you to
grab the "Ghost burst".

01:04:25.330 --> 01:04:27.005
Wait.
That's your plan?

01:04:27.030 --> 01:04:29.141
Leon. None of this
stuff actually works.

01:04:29.205 --> 01:04:31.602
Trial by fire.
Let's burst this ghost.

01:04:31.627 --> 01:04:32.849
Okay, it's a real ghost.

01:04:32.874 --> 01:04:35.971
And that's a fake solution
to a real problem.

01:04:35.996 --> 01:04:38.285
Look, I need you
to trust me.

01:04:38.310 --> 01:04:41.317
I think I actually know what
I'm talking about this time.

01:04:41.342 --> 01:04:44.554
Here.
Look at this.

01:04:49.359 --> 01:04:52.259
The journal of Pierre Boutierre.

01:04:52.286 --> 01:04:56.726
- Where did you find that?
- Some place you don't want to go?

01:04:56.751 --> 01:04:58.919
Look. If you're ready
for another big shock.

01:04:58.944 --> 01:05:01.713
The journal of a lumberjack
is pretty damn boring.

01:05:01.738 --> 01:05:03.212
There's a lot of stupid things
in here like.

01:05:03.237 --> 01:05:04.498
Blade sharpening techniques.

01:05:04.523 --> 01:05:06.933
- The biggest tree ever cut down.
- What was it?

01:05:06.958 --> 01:05:08.759
- What was what?
- The biggest tree.

01:05:08.794 --> 01:05:11.187
How big was it?

01:05:11.212 --> 01:05:13.391
That's so not important
right now.

01:05:13.416 --> 01:05:16.060
What is important is
the last 2 journal entries.

01:05:16.085 --> 01:05:18.456
Here.
I'll read it to you.

01:05:18.636 --> 01:05:21.324
I'm going to quandary over
a recollection of a dream.

01:05:21.348 --> 01:05:23.438
In that dream,
I spoke with a spirit.

01:05:23.463 --> 01:05:25.809
A spirit who called himself
Bumshara.

01:05:25.834 --> 01:05:29.157
He made me a most
peculiar yet tempting offer.

01:05:29.182 --> 01:05:30.806
To my surprise.

01:05:30.831 --> 01:05:32.301
When I became aware
of my surroundings

01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:34.361
I was standing over
nearly a pack of wood

01:05:34.386 --> 01:05:36.973
that I had split with
my very own hands.

01:05:36.998 --> 01:05:39.947
It was as if I had not
been dreaming at all.

01:05:39.979 --> 01:05:42.763
And this is the 
final entry here.

01:05:42.943 --> 01:05:45.411
I've accepted the
offer of Bumshara

01:05:45.436 --> 01:05:47.343
This would be my last
entry as I am leaving

01:05:47.383 --> 01:05:50.128
for more rewarding
life endeavors.

01:05:50.893 --> 01:05:54.100
Well. What do you
think that all means?

01:05:54.125 --> 01:05:56.032
I believe Bumshara
is a demon.

01:05:56.057 --> 01:05:57.220
Well, that's nice.

01:05:57.252 --> 01:05:59.517
So you want to take on
what you believe is a demon.

01:05:59.542 --> 01:06:02.880
Yes. And I can't explain why right now
but you just have to trust me.

01:06:02.904 --> 01:06:05.245
I knew it. See, I knew.
That's why it hurts.

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:08.147
It was a demon and he had an axe.
I didn't have anything, you guys.

01:06:08.172 --> 01:06:10.047
Okay, so.
Heh heh.

01:06:10.072 --> 01:06:11.541
Let's say we trust you.

01:06:11.566 --> 01:06:15.149
We take the "Ghost burst".
Then what?

01:06:15.174 --> 01:06:16.789
Then I.

01:06:16.814 --> 01:06:19.634
I try to lure Pierre into the
common room downstairs.

01:06:19.659 --> 01:06:21.268
And.

01:06:21.293 --> 01:06:22.795
You know.
Then I.

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.543
I kick him out of there.
You know.

01:06:24.568 --> 01:06:26.565
Just be ready with that burst.
Big Finish!

01:06:26.590 --> 01:06:30.824
How exactly are you going to
kick him out of there.

01:06:30.849 --> 01:06:32.540
Trust me.
Please.

01:06:32.565 --> 01:06:34.194
Okay.
I think I'm staying here.

01:06:34.219 --> 01:06:37.007
- Heh-heh. I wouldn't.
- Come on.

01:06:37.032 --> 01:06:38.563
Come on boys and girls.

01:06:38.588 --> 01:06:41.542
Grab your cameras.
Let's.

01:06:43.255 --> 01:06:45.529
Let's get this ghost.

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:54.763
Are you kidding me?

01:06:54.788 --> 01:06:57.901
We're actually going to put our fate
in something called a "Ghost burst".

01:06:57.926 --> 01:06:59.306
Jimmy.
Jimmy said it would work.

01:06:59.331 --> 01:07:00.816
Oh.
Did Jimmy said that?

01:07:00.841 --> 01:07:03.751
Yeah. He had a lot of
technical terms for it.

01:07:03.804 --> 01:07:06.995
It's got like uh.
ADD or something.

01:07:07.020 --> 01:07:08.851
- Yeah. I'll buy that.
- Listen.

01:07:08.898 --> 01:07:10.635
Leon is obviously crazy.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:12.814
but he can't be crazy
enough to think that,

01:07:12.839 --> 01:07:16.392
that is all of a sudden
going to work

01:07:16.544 --> 01:07:19.540
Okay. I'll bring him
down through here.

01:07:19.580 --> 01:07:21.205
Okay. Where do you
want this thing?

01:07:21.230 --> 01:07:22.409
Over there.

01:07:22.434 --> 01:07:24.301
You need to keep it in frame
but you also need

01:07:24.326 --> 01:07:26.168
to be able to get to it.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:27.959
Okay.
Kevin.

01:07:27.999 --> 01:07:29.897
If you're gonna stay up here,
you have to stay off camera.

01:07:29.922 --> 01:07:32.228
So, maybe back in
that corner over there.

01:07:32.253 --> 01:07:33.958
Yeah, no problem.

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:35.406
Rob and I are going
to go upstairs,

01:07:35.431 --> 01:07:37.693
and I will attempt to
lure him down here.

01:07:37.718 --> 01:07:39.595
How are you
going to do that?

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:41.158
I have an idea.

01:07:41.183 --> 01:07:42.927
Are you up for this?

01:07:42.952 --> 01:07:44.409
You'll be fine.

01:07:44.434 --> 01:07:47.206
It's just a ghost axe, right?

01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:50.593
But if you do see Pierre coming
at you, I suggest you run.

01:07:50.618 --> 01:07:53.620
That's actually my idea, so.

01:07:55.709 --> 01:07:59.260
Okay.
Let's do it.

01:08:12.336 --> 01:08:14.029
Okay, stop.

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:16.345
This is good.
Right here.

01:08:18.131 --> 01:08:20.651
Okay, rolling.

01:08:20.676 --> 01:08:23.125
Okay.
Just a second.

01:08:32.830 --> 01:08:34.667
Okay, I'm ready.

01:08:35.343 --> 01:08:38.022
- What're we doing?
- I'm gonna try and call his name.

01:08:38.046 --> 01:08:39.946
- Pierre?
- No.

01:08:40.055 --> 01:08:42.109
Bumshara.

01:09:03.856 --> 01:09:06.145
- Where was it?
- Over there.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.104
It came at me in there.

01:09:08.130 --> 01:09:10.723
And knocked me
down the steps

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:12.469
over there.

01:09:14.443 --> 01:09:16.205
Something.

01:09:17.953 --> 01:09:20.104
Something is here.

01:09:22.196 --> 01:09:25.849
- It isn't good.
- Is it ever?

01:09:27.377 --> 01:09:29.779
Sometimes they're nice.

01:09:31.603 --> 01:09:33.707
Bumshara.

01:09:34.541 --> 01:09:37.616
Bumshara,
I want to talk to you.

01:09:40.357 --> 01:09:43.037
- Leon.
- What?

01:09:43.656 --> 01:09:45.215
There's something.

01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:46.877
What?
You see something?

01:09:46.988 --> 01:09:50.582
Yeah. Yeah.
Right by your head.

01:09:51.037 --> 01:09:53.724
What, what.
You see her?

01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:56.151
- Her?
- Yes, her. Do you see her?

01:09:56.177 --> 01:09:58.553
I'm, I'm see.
I see something.

01:09:58.578 --> 01:10:01.050
She's been talking
to me the whole time.

01:10:01.565 --> 01:10:02.961
What do you mean,
the whole time?

01:10:02.986 --> 01:10:05.152
Ever since we got here.

01:10:06.054 --> 01:10:08.411
- What's she saying to you?
- She.

01:10:08.436 --> 01:10:11.470
Welcomed me to the camp when
we first got here.  She

01:10:11.495 --> 01:10:13.556
lead me to the back hall.

01:10:13.581 --> 01:10:15.272
She helped me find the book.

01:10:15.297 --> 01:10:17.608
Honestly, I didn't say
 anything because

01:10:17.633 --> 01:10:20.807
I thought I was insane.
No one else was hearing it but me.

01:10:20.832 --> 01:10:23.384
Well, who... who is she?
Bumshara?

01:10:23.409 --> 01:10:25.509
No. No.
Mary.

01:10:25.534 --> 01:10:27.396
Her name is Mary.

01:10:27.953 --> 01:10:31.525
She's telling me what to say.
How to get rid of him.

01:10:32.013 --> 01:10:34.408
She says we have the tools.

01:10:35.074 --> 01:10:36.630
The "Ghost burst"?

01:10:36.655 --> 01:10:39.094
I think so.
Keep rolling.

01:10:48.761 --> 01:10:50.747
Rob, is he back there?
Do you see him?

01:10:50.772 --> 01:10:52.369
Him or her?
You were saying her earlier.

01:10:52.394 --> 01:10:55.289
Him, Bumshara.
Pierre.

01:10:56.460 --> 01:10:59.342
No.
But I hear something.

01:10:59.367 --> 01:11:01.353
Yeah.

01:11:01.459 --> 01:11:04.071
Yeah. 
I think he's back there.

01:11:14.302 --> 01:11:18.131
Bumshara.
Are you there?

01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:23.780
Come on.
Don't you want to talk to me?

01:11:23.805 --> 01:11:25.090
Come on, man!

01:11:25.115 --> 01:11:26.833
- What're you doing?
- What?

01:11:26.858 --> 01:11:29.554
Are... Are you taunting him?

01:11:29.579 --> 01:11:30.963
A little.

01:11:30.988 --> 01:11:34.075
Let's... Let's get this ghost.
Come on, camera.

01:11:42.758 --> 01:11:44.869
Pierre is not your problem.

01:11:44.894 --> 01:11:47.333
Bumshara is your evil spirit.

01:11:47.358 --> 01:11:50.917
He's trapped here,
in Pierre.

01:11:50.942 --> 01:11:53.354
- There's a journal.
- Journal?

01:11:53.379 --> 01:11:55.286
Pierre's journal.

01:11:55.311 --> 01:11:58.942
- I don't know.
- Some old books in the basement.

01:11:58.967 --> 01:12:01.093
There's a journal.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:03.922
Bumshara.

01:12:04.434 --> 01:12:06.516
Show yourself!

01:12:09.145 --> 01:12:11.582
- Did you hear that?
- Oh yeah, I did.

01:12:11.607 --> 01:12:14.262
I actually mean did you really hear that.
I'm not doing a gag.

01:12:14.287 --> 01:12:17.164
Yeah, Leon, Leon.
I heard it.

01:12:18.416 --> 01:12:20.244
He's here.

01:12:26.766 --> 01:12:28.690
- Leon.
- What?

01:12:28.971 --> 01:12:30.939
He's right there.

01:12:30.964 --> 01:12:34.972
- Is it Pierre?
- Well , he's got an axe.

01:12:38.462 --> 01:12:40.143
Wait.

01:12:41.053 --> 01:12:44.087
- What, what did she tell you?
- Just keep rolling.

01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.163
Bumshara.

01:12:46.188 --> 01:12:47.833
Come on,
I wan to talk to you.

01:12:47.858 --> 01:12:49.006
- I'm right here.
- Leon.

01:12:49.031 --> 01:12:50.255
- I'm right here, man.
- Leon, Leon.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.926
- What?
- I don't think you want to do that.

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:54.805
- Where is he?
- Well. He's walking at us

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:56.331
Okay.

01:12:56.364 --> 01:12:58.022
He's.
He's by the stairs.

01:12:58.047 --> 01:13:00.105
<i>(Run...)</i>

01:13:00.478 --> 01:13:01.724
I heard that.
Did she say run?

01:13:01.749 --> 01:13:02.999
- She said run.
- Can we run?

01:13:03.024 --> 01:13:04.381
- Yeah, let's run.
- Okay.

01:13:04.406 --> 01:13:06.145
Go, go, go...!

01:13:13.768 --> 01:13:15.492
He's coming!
He's coming this way!

01:13:15.532 --> 01:13:17.197
- You said he was coming that way!
- Never mind what I said.

01:13:17.222 --> 01:13:18.827
- He's right behind us!
- Oh shit! Leon.

01:13:18.852 --> 01:13:20.321
- We're all set up this way.
- I didn't send him this way.

01:13:20.366 --> 01:13:21.890
Hey guys!

01:13:22.965 --> 01:13:24.820
He's right there.

01:13:25.677 --> 01:13:27.650
And he looks pissed.

01:13:40.946 --> 01:13:43.996
Bumshara is your evil spirit.
A demon.

01:13:44.021 --> 01:13:46.307
But there is a way 
to make him leave.

01:13:46.332 --> 01:13:49.502
First. 
Someone must confront him.

01:13:49.559 --> 01:13:52.547
You need to confront the thing
that knocked me down the stairs?

01:13:52.572 --> 01:13:55.617
Yes.
But that's not all.

01:14:00.338 --> 01:14:02.859
Are you talking to someone?

01:14:03.077 --> 01:14:04.373
Mary.

01:14:04.426 --> 01:14:07.502
Mary was a residence here.
Pierre killed her.

01:14:07.527 --> 01:14:10.125
She wants to tell us
what to do.

01:14:18.284 --> 01:14:19.894
Look.

01:14:24.956 --> 01:14:27.142
Oh my god.

01:14:28.409 --> 01:14:31.113
- <i>(Bumshara.)</i>
- Bumshara.

01:14:31.232 --> 01:14:33.680
- <i>(Bumshara.)</i>
- Bumshara.

01:14:33.815 --> 01:14:36.611
- <i>(Bumshara.)</i>
- Bumshara.

01:14:36.757 --> 01:14:40.557
- <i>(Bumshara.)</i>
- Bumshara.

01:14:40.659 --> 01:14:43.331
- <i>(Bumshara.)</i>
- Bumshara.

01:14:43.452 --> 01:14:46.174
- <i>(Bumshara.)</i>
- Bumshara.

01:14:46.392 --> 01:14:47.620
The "Ghost burst".

01:14:47.645 --> 01:14:50.369
- <i>(Bumshara.)</i>
- Bumshara.

01:14:51.279 --> 01:14:53.899
Someone needs to hit
the "Ghost burst".

01:14:55.276 --> 01:14:56.817
Go.

01:14:57.018 --> 01:14:58.727
Leon.

01:15:00.411 --> 01:15:03.046
- <i>(Bumshara.)</i>
- Bumshara.

01:15:07.494 --> 01:15:08.880
Leon, stop.

01:15:08.905 --> 01:15:10.714
Bumshara.

01:15:11.843 --> 01:15:13.679
Bumshara.

01:15:15.168 --> 01:15:16.756
Emily.

01:15:22.979 --> 01:15:25.095
I hope the shit works.

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:26.917
Bumshara.

01:15:27.516 --> 01:15:29.297
Bumshara.

01:15:33.218 --> 01:15:34.528
Bumshara.

01:15:34.553 --> 01:15:38.041
- <i>(Take me.)</i>
- Take me.

01:15:38.066 --> 01:15:39.743
Wait.
What?

01:15:39.768 --> 01:15:41.389
- Mary!
- Leon.

01:15:41.414 --> 01:15:43.167
Hit it.
Hit IT!

01:15:51.074 --> 01:15:52.404
Oh.

01:15:52.429 --> 01:15:54.882
- Jimmy.
- I knew it.

01:16:31.035 --> 01:16:32.666
Someone must invite him in.

01:16:32.691 --> 01:16:35.867
And whoever does so
will take Bumshara with him.

01:16:35.892 --> 01:16:38.792
- Away from here.
- And then what?

01:16:39.271 --> 01:16:41.503
I mean like.
Where do they take him.

01:16:41.528 --> 01:16:45.043
I don't know.   Wherever
he or she goes I suppose.

01:16:45.068 --> 01:16:47.125
Who the hell 
would do that?

01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:48.752
Certainly not me.

01:16:48.777 --> 01:16:50.649
We all know what this
demon did to Pierre.

01:16:50.674 --> 01:16:52.642
Or at least made him do.

01:16:52.667 --> 01:16:54.319
We just got to 
get him out of here.

01:16:54.344 --> 01:16:57.087
The liability insurance
is killing me.

01:16:57.112 --> 01:16:59.708
Well then you going to have to
find someone who will take him.

01:16:59.733 --> 01:17:02.358
- Just who the hell would do that?
- Hold on.

01:17:02.383 --> 01:17:04.638
What about those
ghost hunting shows on TV.

01:17:04.663 --> 01:17:06.955
- They're fake, you know that.
- Yeah, probably.

01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:08.869
But have you seen that
America's Most Haunted one.

01:17:08.894 --> 01:17:11.684
- Get this ghost.
- Right. So, you have seen it.

01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:14.975
Yeah.
They go in and they.

01:17:15.480 --> 01:17:17.136
And.

01:17:17.161 --> 01:17:19.684
They don't just go in and
try to contact the ghost.

01:17:19.709 --> 01:17:21.382
They kick the ghost out.

01:17:21.407 --> 01:17:23.489
They are idiots.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:26.835
They sound perfect to me.

01:17:42.557 --> 01:17:45.055
Oh oh.

01:17:50.307 --> 01:17:53.540
- Was that the ghost burst?
- Yeah.

01:17:53.565 --> 01:17:55.743
Yeah, yeah.
My camera won't turn on.

01:17:55.768 --> 01:17:57.581
That son of a bitch.

01:17:57.606 --> 01:17:59.614
Nice going, Jimmy.

01:18:01.885 --> 01:18:03.119
What?

01:18:03.144 --> 01:18:05.253
You said ADD.
Did you mean EMP?

01:18:05.278 --> 01:18:07.192
Is that what he said?

01:18:08.116 --> 01:18:10.624
Oh yeah, right.
That's it, EMP.

01:18:10.649 --> 01:18:11.725
That's what I meant.

01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:14.250
The EMP.
Jimmy actually did it.

01:18:14.275 --> 01:18:17.226
- That means everything is dead.
- Except us.

01:18:17.251 --> 01:18:18.688
I can't believe Jimmy
actually created

01:18:18.713 --> 01:18:20.947
an ElectroMagnetic Pulse generator.

01:18:20.972 --> 01:18:22.816
Uh.

01:18:23.103 --> 01:18:25.862
I'm still be able to
have kids, right?

01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:29.601
It means. That's a break.
That's a break. Your's a break.

01:18:29.626 --> 01:18:32.634
Everything electronic
in this room is gone.

01:18:32.659 --> 01:18:34.358
Leon.

01:18:34.780 --> 01:18:36.554
Are you okay?

01:18:36.579 --> 01:18:38.029
Whoa, who.
Hey buddy, hey buddy.

01:18:38.054 --> 01:18:40.477
Hey, you're good.
Come on.

01:18:41.601 --> 01:18:43.374
- Oh.
- Whoa, whoa.

01:18:43.427 --> 01:18:44.998
Leon.

01:18:45.346 --> 01:18:47.196
Oh.

01:18:47.221 --> 01:18:48.521
Hey Emily.

01:18:48.546 --> 01:18:50.423
Are you okay?

01:18:50.821 --> 01:18:53.122
Fine.
Great.

01:18:53.227 --> 01:18:54.750
He's gone.

01:18:54.775 --> 01:18:57.951
Jimmy's ghost burst
actually worked.

01:18:58.174 --> 01:19:00.178
That's nice.

01:19:00.654 --> 01:19:02.419
But I..
I think it fried all the.

01:19:02.444 --> 01:19:04.627
I think it fried all
the equipment, Leon.

01:19:04.652 --> 01:19:06.030
All the cameras.

01:19:06.055 --> 01:19:08.698
I think the cards too and
we lost all the footage.

01:19:08.723 --> 01:19:11.028
That's good too.
That's great.

01:19:11.053 --> 01:19:13.396
Leon. No, no.
It's.

01:19:13.455 --> 01:19:15.374
Show gone.
Footage gone.

01:19:15.399 --> 01:19:17.189
Everything

01:19:17.214 --> 01:19:18.788
gone.

01:19:20.447 --> 01:19:22.855
I've said it before but
I mean it this time, guys.

01:19:22.887 --> 01:19:24.749
He needs help.

01:19:24.774 --> 01:19:26.620
- Let's get you out of here.
- I'm a hero.

01:19:26.651 --> 01:19:28.273
Yeah. That'll be a
real good work today.

01:19:28.298 --> 01:19:30.980
- I think I fell down.
- I think we all did.

01:19:31.005 --> 01:19:33.853
So, I pooped
in my pants a little.

01:19:41.666 --> 01:19:44.258
Haven't seen Jimmy in town.

01:19:44.293 --> 01:19:45.565
Have you seen him 
around here?

01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:47.911
We haven't seen him
since last night.

01:19:48.695 --> 01:19:49.932
What do you want to do?

01:19:49.957 --> 01:19:52.317
I guess we'll just go back to
town and talk to the police

01:19:52.353 --> 01:19:55.177
I think we should.
I'm a little worried.

01:19:55.208 --> 01:19:57.707
Let's just get out of here.

01:19:57.732 --> 01:20:00.033
Well, whatever you say.

01:20:00.064 --> 01:20:02.231
Mike and Kyle will
take you back to town

01:20:02.256 --> 01:20:05.048
and I'll be back shortly.

01:20:11.093 --> 01:20:12.867
Leon.

01:20:13.967 --> 01:20:15.893
I'm okay.

01:20:43.153 --> 01:20:45.433
So, what do you think?

01:20:45.458 --> 01:20:47.483
He's gone.

01:20:49.120 --> 01:20:51.837
He's definitely gone.
