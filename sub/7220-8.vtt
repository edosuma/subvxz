00:01.920 --> 00:03.684
<i>Previously on</i>
Justified“.

00:04.000 --> 00:05.001
What's our play?

00:05.080 --> 00:06.445
Walker is burned.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.085
<i>He's a rogue element.</i>

00:09.240 --> 00:10.810
<i>Ain't nothing for him now.</i>

00:11.400 --> 00:13.360
It almost looks like somebody
out the boards away.

00:14.560 --> 00:16.210
God damn, son, you got
one hell of an eye.

00:16.280 --> 00:17.611
Aah!

00:19.920 --> 00:22.127
You think that I was the rat?

00:22.240 --> 00:24.083
It was why I got out of here.

00:24.160 --> 00:25.491
Figured I was next.

00:25.560 --> 00:27.005
You've thought that
all these years.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.640
Why the hell would you
want to marry me?

00:28.720 --> 00:29.926
I've made my peace with it.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.843
Were you the snitch?
Of course not.

00:31.960 --> 00:32.960
Well, somebody was.

00:33.000 --> 00:35.526
And what better way to get you
thinking it can't have been him

00:35.600 --> 00:36.886
than to say
he thinks it was you?

00:36.960 --> 00:38.371
So, how about you come out,

00:38.440 --> 00:40.204
say what it is you got to say?

00:40.800 --> 00:42.211
I'm a snitch.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.611
I'm a CI for Raylan.

00:43.680 --> 00:48.447
I understand what you
did, why you did it.

00:49.560 --> 00:52.166
I still love you.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.049
I love you, too, Boyd.

00:54.240 --> 00:55.969
I'm saying I love you,

00:56.080 --> 00:57.241
and if you want it,

00:57.320 --> 00:59.129
I want you by my side
raising our daughter.

00:59.200 --> 01:00.361
We gonna do this, then?

01:00.440 --> 01:01.771
I don't see how we don't try.

01:01.840 --> 01:04.206
What do you give us?
50/50 shot?

01:04.760 --> 01:06.125
51/49.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.291
Sorry, Boyd. I would've
called you sooner, but...

03:17.360 --> 03:18.850
Where is he?

03:19.080 --> 03:20.161
He's down in the mine.

03:20.240 --> 03:21.526
Not The Pig.
Where's Zachariah?

03:21.600 --> 03:23.568
That's what I mean...
He's down in the mine.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.046
I thought you said
he'd stopped working.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.201
He did.

03:26.280 --> 03:28.442
Said to send you down
as soon as you got here.

03:28.560 --> 03:30.289
He wants to show you
how it happened.

03:32.360 --> 03:33.805
It's a damn shame about The Pig.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.211
He was a good man.
Yeah.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.561
Earl, I want you
to get Ava home,

03:40.440 --> 03:41.885
and I don't want you to let
her out of your sight.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.086
You understand?

03:43.200 --> 03:44.201
Yes, sir.

03:44.520 --> 03:46.124
Come over here.

03:47.280 --> 03:48.805
Look, I'll be there soon.

03:49.320 --> 03:50.560
Meantime,
you start looking around,

03:50.640 --> 03:51.721
see what it is you
want to take with you.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.564
All this is over.

03:55.320 --> 03:57.163
I supposed to pack
anything for you?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.641
We got the money.
I'll have you.

04:00.360 --> 04:01.600
Everything else, I can replace.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.326
Boyd.

04:03.880 --> 04:05.325
You still have my phone.

04:09.760 --> 04:11.649
This is our only
pipeline to Raylan.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.051
We got to use it wisely and
in concert with each other.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.845
You trust me?

04:18.560 --> 04:20.084
You trust me?

04:20.160 --> 04:22.367
Yes.

04:29.440 --> 04:30.771
Earl.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.200
Carl.

04:33.760 --> 04:35.728
Do you wish to exhume
all the plots?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.529
Just the two, my parents.

04:37.640 --> 04:39.529
And how long ago
were they interred?

04:39.600 --> 04:41.648
Her 2000, him last year.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.569
And how about the manner
in which they were buried?

04:43.720 --> 04:45.245
I wasn't around,
but I guarantee you

04:45.320 --> 04:47.527
he put her in the cheapest
piece of shit available.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.126
Likely an unvaulted
wooden casket.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.440
Mmm-hmm.
And him?

04:51.560 --> 04:53.608
I put him in the cheapest
piece of shit available.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.802
A word of caution, if I may.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.921
What you're moving
is not your mother's remains.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.241
It is the idea of her remains.

05:03.920 --> 05:06.287
You well may be digging
up nothing but dirt.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.210
Then dig up the dirt.

05:09.320 --> 05:10.446
Very well.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.244
The process can be
labor-intensive.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.124
We will
supervise all the work,

05:14.400 --> 05:17.165
handle the state
and municipal permits

05:17.240 --> 05:19.004
and all the transportation.

05:19.080 --> 05:20.081
Okay.

05:20.160 --> 05:21.650
Now, you mentioned
the new location

05:21.720 --> 05:23.529
is the town cemetery.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.090
Just for her.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.968
Uh, and your father's
final resting place?

05:29.240 --> 05:30.890
Whatever works for you.

05:31.840 --> 05:33.808
Uh, well, it's
entirely up to you.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.605
Potter's field?

05:38.920 --> 05:40.206
What happened to your lawn?

05:40.280 --> 05:42.089
Did I interrupt
a goat sacrifice?

05:42.240 --> 05:43.810
Tim. What's up?

05:44.080 --> 05:45.684
Oh, leads on Walker's movements

05:45.760 --> 05:47.649
are coming from
conflicting sources.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.449
I petitioned Rachel
I come back down,

05:49.600 --> 05:52.206
regroup the teams,
re-evaluate the leads.

05:52.280 --> 05:53.560
Dude, what happened
to your lawn?

05:53.600 --> 05:54.886
All right, so you're
gonna work out here?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.843
Good. You can watch
the place while I'm gone.

05:56.960 --> 05:58.405
Oh, you're heading out?
Mmm-hmm.

05:58.480 --> 06:01.370
Well, be a peach and run down
an eyewitness out in London.

06:01.440 --> 06:02.960
Saw a suspicious
character on her lawn.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.365
I ain't working the manhunt.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.968
Your 24 hours on the
fainting couch are done.

06:07.040 --> 06:09.088
I'm back to work. I just
ain't looking for Walker.

06:09.160 --> 06:10.650
This have anything
to do with him?

06:10.760 --> 06:13.161
No, a lead I came
up with on my own.

06:13.320 --> 06:14.685
Unrelated to the Walker thing?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.564
Zachariah Randolph.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.445
Let me guess, local boy.

06:19.240 --> 06:22.483
How come no one down here's
ever named Steve or Justin?

06:22.800 --> 06:23.961
Ava's kin,

06:24.080 --> 06:25.809
her maiden name being Randolph.

06:25.880 --> 06:27.086
Practical question...

06:27.160 --> 06:28.650
When can I tell
Acting Chief Brooks

06:28.720 --> 06:30.563
to expect you back
on job number one?

06:31.160 --> 06:33.322
Getting Boyd Crowder
is job number one.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.129
The way he said it, you know?

06:37.200 --> 06:39.601
Like last time I didn't do
a good job or something.

06:39.680 --> 06:40.920
Honestly, Earl,

06:41.000 --> 06:42.809
Boyd's got bigger
things on his mind

06:42.920 --> 06:45.082
than to be angry at you.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.611
I promise.

06:47.280 --> 06:48.645
You locked the door.

06:49.640 --> 06:51.529
I suppose it's just the
three of us, then.

07:27.080 --> 07:28.605
Hey, there, Boyd.

07:28.760 --> 07:29.921
Sorry about your man.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.490
I don't give a shit
about that man.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.370
How much?

07:34.040 --> 07:35.121
What's that?

07:35.200 --> 07:37.441
How much you trying to shake
me down for, Zachariah?

07:37.600 --> 07:38.647
What the hell?

07:38.720 --> 07:40.370
You think I'm quitting
'cause I want more money?

07:40.560 --> 07:42.400
I'm quitting 'cause
it's too goddamn dangerous.

07:42.480 --> 07:44.323
Why I paid you $10,000 to do it.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.044
A man died, Boyd.

07:46.120 --> 07:48.168
A man you ain't known
a goddamn week!

07:48.280 --> 07:50.282
Well, I can see you're
really torn up about it.

07:50.840 --> 07:52.444
Real leader of men, ain't ya?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.887
It ain't the first man I've
lost doing a job, Zachariah,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.843
and the job ain't over yet.

07:57.440 --> 07:58.930
Now, how much?

08:03.920 --> 08:05.570
Another 10 grand ought to do it.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.245
I'll give you 5.

08:09.920 --> 08:11.604
And you and Carl got two days

08:11.720 --> 08:13.210
to get to the bottom
of that vault.

08:13.280 --> 08:15.328
Might want to switch to dynamite
sooner than we planned.

08:15.400 --> 08:16.640
That gonna cost me extra?

08:17.880 --> 08:19.405
Yeah. Gratis.

08:26.760 --> 08:28.444
Now take
another loop around.

08:29.760 --> 08:31.444
Now tuck it under.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.046
Tie it off.

08:33.120 --> 08:34.884
You're gonna be tempted
to leave that loose

08:34.960 --> 08:37.327
so as to allow a valiant escape.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.044
You best perish that thought.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.124
You got any duct tape?

08:45.480 --> 08:46.766
Got some over here.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.245
No, you don't.

08:48.480 --> 08:50.881
That's where you had
that nickel 9-milly.

08:51.120 --> 08:54.602
I also moved the shotgun you had
in that cupboard over there,

08:55.840 --> 08:57.080
in case that was the next place

08:57.160 --> 08:58.969
you wanted to say
the duct tape was.

08:59.040 --> 09:00.804
In that case,

09:00.880 --> 09:03.281
guess I don't have any duct tape, Mr.
Walker.

09:04.120 --> 09:07.169
Now, before you make
the risky decision

09:07.960 --> 09:09.644
to go for any other hidden gun

09:09.720 --> 09:10.801
I might have missed

09:10.920 --> 09:12.729
or to try for your drawers

09:12.800 --> 09:15.326
in the hopes that I failed
to secure your cutlery,

09:15.960 --> 09:17.485
you should know this...

09:17.560 --> 09:18.971
I'm not here to hurt you.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.728
Okay.
Or Boyd, either.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.489
You don't believe me.
I get that.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.245
I'll explain why you should

09:27.320 --> 09:29.049
while we await Boyd's return.

09:30.080 --> 09:31.491
But first...

09:32.800 --> 09:34.290
I need you to stitch me up.

09:38.320 --> 09:39.685
Ugh.

09:40.160 --> 09:41.321
Zachariah Randolph?

09:45.040 --> 09:46.201
I am.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.805
Raylan Givens.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.923
Dog hole mine, 1990?

09:52.000 --> 09:53.081
Joseph's valley.

09:53.160 --> 09:54.889
Joseph's valley...
Long time ago.

09:56.040 --> 09:58.202
You remember a digger
named Boyd Crowder?

09:59.360 --> 10:01.010
You Arlo Givens' boy, ain't you?

10:01.200 --> 10:02.281
I am.

10:02.520 --> 10:03.760
What line of work
you in these days?

10:03.840 --> 10:04.840
Now, look here, sonny.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.405
I didn't have no dealings
with your daddy,

10:06.480 --> 10:07.811
and, all due respect
to your time on the earth,

10:07.880 --> 10:09.405
I don't want no dealings
with you, neither.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.648
Yeah. Most people don't.

10:11.880 --> 10:13.370
What you got
in that crate there?

10:13.440 --> 10:15.841
Eh... It ain't none
of your affairs.

10:16.080 --> 10:17.366
Man of principle?

10:17.840 --> 10:20.525
"Dishonest man spreadeth
strife," sayeth the lord.

10:20.680 --> 10:22.648
What's your rate?

10:22.880 --> 10:24.325
What's that?
You're a whore.

10:24.400 --> 10:25.845
What do you charge?
I'm just curious.

10:25.920 --> 10:27.285
Now, look, I don't
care who you are

10:27.360 --> 10:28.646
or what past we share.

10:28.720 --> 10:30.006
You just go on, get out of here.

10:30.080 --> 10:31.081
I know Boyd's paying you.

10:31.200 --> 10:33.726
I open that crate,
am I gonna find out what for?

10:33.800 --> 10:35.320
Maybe what I'm doing
ain't about money.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
It's always about money.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.611
Jesus Christ, the one thing
every shit-apple redneck

10:39.720 --> 10:41.324
is guaranteed to take
with both hands

10:41.400 --> 10:42.890
and left foot is money.

10:42.960 --> 10:44.928
Maybe you in
for a little surprise.

10:45.040 --> 10:46.326
Maybe this ain't
what you think it is.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.164
Maybe it all ain't gonna turn
out the way you think it will.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.441
Move.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.170
You gonna have to move me.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.206
God damn you!

11:13.600 --> 11:14.681
Damn it.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.291
You had enough?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.441
Yeah.

11:21.520 --> 11:22.726
You Okay?

11:22.920 --> 11:24.365
Yeah.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.251
Got me pretty good.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.766
Well, I still got some scrap.

11:41.640 --> 11:43.722
I guess this is the end
of the line, ain't it?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.849
I ain't gonna take you in.

11:48.320 --> 11:49.685
Thank you.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.281
Don't.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.164
You're in deep shit either way.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.731
Where's Wynn?

12:04.800 --> 12:05.961
Oh, he'll be right out.

12:06.040 --> 12:07.360
He spilled guacamole
on his shirt.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.971
9:30 in the morning?

12:09.080 --> 12:10.206
He loves guac.

12:11.560 --> 12:12.561
Is there any ice?

12:12.640 --> 12:14.608
Mikey, when was the last time
you went to the dry cleaners?

12:14.680 --> 12:15.960
I don't have
a single clean shirt

12:16.000 --> 12:17.081
that goes with these pants.

12:17.160 --> 12:18.650
Thought I went Tuesday.
Well...

12:18.720 --> 12:20.802
I don't have a lot of time.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.121
I'm playing tennis with my
shithead sister-in-law.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.929
It'll be the fall of Saigon
if I'm late.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.128
Where do you play? We should
play doubles sometime.

12:27.360 --> 12:29.169
I dated a tennis pro
for a while.

12:35.560 --> 12:37.005
I'll go to the cleaners.

12:37.520 --> 12:39.124
You want proof
Markham's the rat?

12:41.680 --> 12:42.841
This is it?

12:43.160 --> 12:45.731
Do you remember a gentleman
by the name of Gordon Keith?

12:46.360 --> 12:47.441
Maybe.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.921
Uh... beard,

12:50.000 --> 12:51.843
wouldn't shut up
about Lee Harvey Oswald?

12:51.920 --> 12:53.046
That's the one.

12:53.160 --> 12:55.162
Yeah, kind of wheels-off,
if I remember.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.607
If you read that file,
you may also remember

12:57.680 --> 12:59.444
his weapon of choice
is a shotgun.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.091
Simon Poole.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.210
The US Attorney, yes...
Shotgunned in the street.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.887
Yeah, the feds keep
trying to put that one on me.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.485
The world's an unjust
place, Katherine.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.443
All right, so this
indicts Avery how?

13:12.040 --> 13:13.371
I'm getting to that.

13:15.200 --> 13:17.806
Two days after your husband
was put in lockup,

13:17.880 --> 13:20.611
the aforementioned Gordon
Keith was picked up

13:20.680 --> 13:22.489
for shoplifting
a bottle of vodka.

13:22.560 --> 13:24.688
I happen to know Gordon
Keith is not a vodka man.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.527
Two days after Gordon's arrest,

13:27.600 --> 13:29.523
your husband is
found dead in his cell.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.404
Then, and only then,

13:31.480 --> 13:32.606
does Gordon Keith make bail.

13:32.680 --> 13:35.126
Wynn, didn't Gordon
Keith work for you?

13:35.200 --> 13:37.282
He worked with me. He
worked for Avery Markham.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.321
And now?

13:40.400 --> 13:41.640
And now...
Well, now he's dead.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.688
Convenient.
Occupational hazard.

13:44.560 --> 13:46.403
Well, I will read the file.

13:46.840 --> 13:49.889
Hope it carries more weight
than that rock on your finger.

13:50.160 --> 13:51.321
Mmm.

13:52.240 --> 13:54.811
You know, Avery's getting
sick of this mess in Harlan.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.767
His men all dead, the place
crawling with marshals now.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.365
I was unable to reach
Boyd last night,

14:00.440 --> 14:01.521
but when last we spoke,

14:01.600 --> 14:03.921
he was well aware of the
urgency of the situation.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.320
Yeah.

14:05.400 --> 14:07.607
Then again, if he
doesn't get it in time,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.409
maybe it's not
the end of the world.

14:10.160 --> 14:11.889
Oh?
I marry Avery,

14:12.320 --> 14:14.322
we take his money
a year from now,

14:14.440 --> 14:16.283
two years from now...
It doesn't really matter.

14:16.840 --> 14:19.241
I'll have access to his
entire bank account.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.441
Seems like I'm a third
wheel in that scenario.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.488
I wouldn't be too anxious, Wynn.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.450
I'm just thinking out loud.

14:33.920 --> 14:35.445
You think Boyd'll go for it?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.244
You're gonna have
to wait and ask Boyd.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.645
If he doesn't,

14:43.080 --> 14:45.680
there's no reason you and I couldn't
go through with it ourselves.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.211
Maybe Earl could help out.

14:49.440 --> 14:50.805
You be up for that, Earl?

14:50.880 --> 14:52.211
Aah!
Aah!

14:56.120 --> 14:57.406
Oh, m...

15:00.840 --> 15:02.001
Oh, my.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.126
That was interesting.

15:06.560 --> 15:08.562
Earl's pitiful life
passed before his eyes.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.846
Didn't it, Earl?

15:13.040 --> 15:14.724
All right, let's get back to it.

15:14.880 --> 15:18.851
And this time, as discussed,
please place the sutures

15:18.920 --> 15:20.760
a full quarter inch
from the edge of the wound.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.086
All right.

15:39.080 --> 15:40.366
Ava?

15:42.640 --> 15:44.290
Where you at, girl?

15:47.520 --> 15:48.806
Boyd, you put it down.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.211
I just came to talk.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.887
If I wanted to hurt you, I would've
done it already, don't you think?

15:52.960 --> 15:54.166
I gave up guessing

15:54.240 --> 15:56.527
why people do what they
do a long time ago.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.320
Only way you're
gonna get this gun

15:59.360 --> 16:01.283
out of my hand is with a bullet.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.522
Are you really here to talk?

16:04.320 --> 16:07.164
Why don't you put it down?

16:19.200 --> 16:21.089
Here. All right.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.568
Boyd.
Boyd, hold on.

16:25.560 --> 16:29.167
You come into my house, put
your hands on my fiancée?

16:29.280 --> 16:30.691
I'm fine. Boyd, he's
telling the truth.

16:30.800 --> 16:32.165
Markham cut him loose.
Good!

16:32.240 --> 16:33.366
Then nobody'll give a shit

16:33.440 --> 16:34.680
when they find his rotten corpse

16:34.760 --> 16:36.091
at the bottom of a mine shaft.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.770
- Wait!
- Boyd, wait!

16:38.080 --> 16:39.605
He knows the combination
to the vault.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.807
My men are either dead
or in the wind...

16:49.200 --> 16:50.770
Every one of them.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.082
Maybe the old man's there,
maybe he's not,

16:53.160 --> 16:54.810
but he's one man.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.006
He'll bring someone else in,

16:56.080 --> 16:57.570
but he hasn't had time
to do it yet.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.529
That vault is
completely unguarded.

16:59.600 --> 17:01.887
You don't think he's changed
the combination by now?

17:02.200 --> 17:03.884
Ah, there's not a
smith in this state

17:04.000 --> 17:05.763
skilled enough
to service that vault.

17:05.839 --> 17:07.204
You're a careful man, Boyd,

17:07.280 --> 17:08.724
but you know full well
my Way's better than

17:08.839 --> 17:10.329
any scheme you've got cooking.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.608
You trying to manipulate me, Mr.
Walker?

17:12.960 --> 17:16.362
'Cause I'm long past the point
of needing my ego stroked.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.363
Let's just say I don't see you

17:18.440 --> 17:19.885
pulling
thrill-seeker holdups

17:19.960 --> 17:22.281
with a "born to lose"
tattoo on your chest.

17:23.640 --> 17:26.086
Well, me being a careful
man, I got to ask...

17:27.160 --> 17:29.481
Why you want to help me so bad, Mr.
Walker?

17:29.760 --> 17:32.331
You mean, why didn't
I sneak in there myself,

17:32.400 --> 17:34.767
line my pockets,
get out of town?

17:35.320 --> 17:37.641
It's that last part that's
the problem, isn't it?

17:37.880 --> 17:39.644
We got LEOs
combing these hills...

17:40.280 --> 17:42.760
Hills that, for me,
are unfamiliar terrain.

17:42.840 --> 17:45.320
But not so unfamiliar
to us. That it?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.202
I'm not trying to help you
so much as help myself.

17:49.280 --> 17:51.601
How do we know Boyd doesn't
walk down into that basement,

17:51.680 --> 17:53.762
find himself surrounded
by a dozen guns?

17:53.840 --> 17:55.649
You're saying I got myself shot,

17:55.760 --> 17:58.161
risked my life coming in
here, just to set you up?

17:58.920 --> 18:00.880
It's a lot of effort just
to dick you people over.

18:00.960 --> 18:02.325
Could be you got yourself shot,

18:02.400 --> 18:04.164
Avery Markham said,
"You bring me Boyd Crowder,

18:04.240 --> 18:05.526
"I'll take you anywhere
you want to go."

18:05.680 --> 18:08.160
You're crossing the border
from careful to paranoid now.

18:08.520 --> 18:11.683
Well, you might have been
a little more paranoid,

18:11.840 --> 18:14.764
you wouldn't be in the situation
you currently find yourself.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.681
Yet, at some point,

18:17.760 --> 18:19.728
you have to trust me,
or you have to shoot me.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.042
Well, you're a lucky man,
Mr. Walker.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.730
Not two days ago,

18:28.800 --> 18:31.770
I would've told you, "Good
night and good luck,"

18:32.600 --> 18:34.329
but circumstances have changed.

18:34.480 --> 18:35.641
Partners, then?

18:35.760 --> 18:37.205
I don't need another partner.

18:37.880 --> 18:39.609
But I will help you
rob that vault.

18:42.600 --> 18:44.489
Chief Deputy Art Mullen.

18:44.600 --> 18:45.647
Come on in.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.006
Ms. Hale.

18:47.760 --> 18:49.364
Although I suppose
it's technically

18:49.480 --> 18:51.801
"on-leave Chief
Deputy" right now.

18:51.960 --> 18:55.601
Yeah, they told me that when I
called there asking about you.

18:56.440 --> 18:58.249
That's such a shame.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.290
Eh, it's damned annoying
more than anything else,

19:01.480 --> 19:04.131
but I guess I'm better off
than the guy who shot me.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.202
Suppose you're wondering
why I asked you here.

19:06.280 --> 19:07.441
Oh, I don't know.

19:07.520 --> 19:10.330
Pretty lady like you,
clandestine hotel meeting...

19:10.400 --> 19:11.925
I think I can figure it out.

19:12.640 --> 19:15.405
Well, actually, Avery called me

19:15.480 --> 19:19.724
and told me some bald,
wrinkled asshole of a marshal

19:19.800 --> 19:22.371
was giving him grief,
and I said,

19:22.520 --> 19:24.682
"Why, I would recognize
that description anywhere."

19:24.760 --> 19:26.364
Oh, that really
doesn't ring a bell.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.529
What's it been, like, 14 years?

19:28.760 --> 19:30.250
I wasn't even bald back then.

19:31.280 --> 19:32.850
Well, maybe a little.

19:33.080 --> 19:36.050
Yeah, that was a long time ago,

19:36.120 --> 19:39.010
which makes me wonder
why you are so concerned

19:39.080 --> 19:42.243
about who ratted out my
husband way back then.

19:42.320 --> 19:43.890
Oh, you know, I'm sitting there,

19:43.960 --> 19:46.361
recuperating from gunshot,

19:46.440 --> 19:49.125
watching all that <i>Forensic Files</i>

19:49.200 --> 19:51.771
unsolved-mystery
bullshit on TV,

19:52.400 --> 19:54.243
and then I hear about the
shit hitting the fan

19:54.320 --> 19:56.402
with your boy toy,
Markham, down in Harlan,

19:56.480 --> 19:58.130
and got my curiosity up.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.645
Well, when you find that snitch,

19:59.760 --> 20:01.000
what are you gonna do with him?

20:01.120 --> 20:02.281
Or her.

20:03.320 --> 20:04.731
"Or her."
Mmm-hmm.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.406
Yeah, well, it occurred to me
that the snitch might know

20:07.480 --> 20:09.130
who shotgunned Simon Poole...

20:09.880 --> 20:11.962
And, in fact, might be
the one who did it.

20:12.280 --> 20:14.647
Well, isn't that little
Mexican AUSA of yours

20:14.720 --> 20:16.848
already convinced
that I'm the one

20:16.920 --> 20:19.002
who had his boss gunned down?

20:19.800 --> 20:22.406
Lack of evidence to the
contrary, it's not a bad bet.

20:26.640 --> 20:27.846
You know what?

20:27.920 --> 20:29.490
It's a crazy coincidence,

20:29.560 --> 20:31.005
but I happen to be looking into

20:31.080 --> 20:33.128
the murder of
Simon Poole, as well.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.806
Really?

20:35.120 --> 20:36.724
Trying to clear your good name?

20:36.880 --> 20:39.087
Well, it seems to me that

20:39.160 --> 20:40.764
whoever killed Simon Poole

20:40.840 --> 20:43.844
is probably the same person
who killed Grady in prison.

20:43.920 --> 20:48.448
All at the behest of whoever
ratted on Grady to begin with.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.531
And you think it's Markham?

20:53.080 --> 20:54.286
What do you think?

20:57.440 --> 20:58.680
I, um...

20:59.200 --> 21:00.884
I'm gonna need to open a drawer.

21:01.680 --> 21:02.886
Slowly.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.449
Do you know who Gordon Keith is?

21:15.520 --> 21:16.965
Can't say that I do.

21:17.040 --> 21:18.530
Well, see what you
can make of that.

21:20.480 --> 21:21.527
Hmm.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.522
You just want
to see justice done, huh?

21:29.160 --> 21:30.889
The man who shot you...

21:32.040 --> 21:34.247
He changed your
life forever, right?

21:37.400 --> 21:39.164
And what happened to him?

21:39.440 --> 21:41.204
Well, he got his balls shot off,

21:41.320 --> 21:43.084
then he got gut-shot.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.248
<i>Least, that's what
the report said.</i>

21:45.400 --> 21:47.243
Sadly, I wasn't there.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.049
Well, the guy who
ratted on Grady

21:50.200 --> 21:52.407
turned my life to shit,

21:52.480 --> 21:54.881
and I want something
like that to happen to him.

21:55.560 --> 21:57.324
That is what I want.

21:59.760 --> 22:01.569
You can see yourself out.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.608
I figured I'd find you
back in Harlan...

22:26.680 --> 22:29.570
Back of your restaurant,
back against the wall.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.923
I've heard it called
"The Sicilian Advantage."

22:32.320 --> 22:34.084
Well, I ain't Sicilian.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.211
I'm just reading a newspaper.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.966
Eyes on points
of entry and exit,

22:39.040 --> 22:41.281
geography mitigating surprise.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.127
You're down a few
on your security detail.

22:44.360 --> 22:46.681
Why you got that shoulder rig.

22:47.520 --> 22:50.603
Take any comers try to hit
your vault full of drug money.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.610
You see that sign?

22:53.280 --> 22:54.964
Have a nice day, Marshal.

22:57.760 --> 22:59.091
You see this star?

22:59.800 --> 23:01.131
Kiss my ass, Markham.

23:03.400 --> 23:04.606
Harlan.

23:05.040 --> 23:06.644
Hell of a place
to make your fortune.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.002
Fortune? Hell, I'm
putting down roots.

23:09.480 --> 23:11.164
Tough to do in quicksand.

23:12.040 --> 23:13.769
You proud of yourself...

23:13.960 --> 23:15.121
Slowing me down?

23:15.200 --> 23:16.884
I might be
if I was the only one.

23:17.560 --> 23:20.245
Can't take credit for all
your troubles, though, can I?

23:21.360 --> 23:22.964
If you're not part
of the solution,

23:23.040 --> 23:24.246
you're part of the problem.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.845
That's why you drove
up to Lexington.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.041
Show the U.S. Marshals
you're there to help?

23:29.440 --> 23:31.488
You're asking for my help?

23:31.560 --> 23:33.085
I want Walker, you want land.

23:33.160 --> 23:34.605
Help me get Walker,

23:34.680 --> 23:36.170
maybe you get your land.

23:37.320 --> 23:38.606
My, my.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.610
Stooping to extortion.

23:40.680 --> 23:42.603
"Extortion"?
Simple math.

23:42.880 --> 23:45.167
I get Walker cleared
of my plate, I get Boyd.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.682
That's about
as clear as mud, son.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.685
Who you waiting to barge
through that door? Hmm?

23:52.240 --> 23:55.642
Who put the word out to half
the landowners in town?

23:55.800 --> 23:57.131
Telling me it wasn't you?

23:57.200 --> 23:59.123
You think folks around here
are gonna turn you away

23:59.200 --> 24:01.282
'cause some lawman said so?

24:03.520 --> 24:05.682
Crowder said,
"You sell, you die."

24:06.080 --> 24:08.367
You're telling me, after
all the saber rattling,

24:08.440 --> 24:09.885
we're on the same side?

24:11.280 --> 24:13.044
Saying we got a common problem.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.442
And Walker's the man in between.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.760
I know what you're thinking.

24:19.080 --> 24:22.368
Walker goes down, talks,
you're in the hot seat.

24:22.760 --> 24:25.570
But you ever know an ex-ranger
to give up without a fight?

24:28.400 --> 24:31.131
I just can't imagine you're
part of the solution.

24:31.720 --> 24:32.881
Who else you got?

24:34.000 --> 24:35.240
Tell me why.

24:36.800 --> 24:39.201
Let's just say you're
putting down roots,

24:39.480 --> 24:41.050
I'm pulling up.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.685
Sick of the past.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.006
True.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.924
Past is a shadow.

24:48.240 --> 24:49.969
Always there behind you.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.242
In Harlan...
Shit, it ain't behind you.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.640
It's vertical.

24:53.800 --> 24:55.723
Dig down another layer,

24:55.800 --> 24:57.643
turn up some horror.

25:00.240 --> 25:02.368
Let's talk how we get
the man in the middle.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.885
What's the one thing

25:07.960 --> 25:10.804
no shit-apple redneck
in the world can resist?

25:11.840 --> 25:14.081
And that will be coming
up at the top of the hour

25:14.200 --> 25:16.043
here on The Crow
Show, but right now,

25:16.160 --> 25:18.288
I am joined by
once-and-future

25:18.360 --> 25:20.806
local luminary Avery Markham.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.211
<i>Now, this is a man who...</i>

25:22.280 --> 25:23.805
Tim, I know I said

25:23.880 --> 25:25.405
I wasn't gonna help
run down Walker,

25:25.480 --> 25:27.130
<i>but, well...</i>

25:28.000 --> 25:29.411
<i>There's a certain kind of man</i>

25:29.480 --> 25:31.926
<i>who, in this situation, would
say, "You're welcome."</i>

25:32.440 --> 25:34.647
<i>Not me, per se...
A certain kind of man.</i>

25:34.760 --> 25:35.966
A dick.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.964
Pretty sure there's a radio
there on the dining room hutch.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.162
<i>Tune into AM 1194.</i>

25:50.360 --> 25:52.442
All right, quiet,
everyone. Hey!

25:52.520 --> 25:53.521
<i>You listen to</i>
The Crow Show,

25:53.640 --> 25:54.687
<i>you know we here are keeping...</i>

25:54.760 --> 25:56.728
They're playing Raylan's
song on the radio, here.

25:56.800 --> 25:58.211
<i>...going on
with law enforcement,</i>

25:58.280 --> 25:59.805
<i>and I'm not exaggerating to say</i>

25:59.880 --> 26:02.770
<i>that there's a pretty serious
manhunt going on out there,</i>

26:02.840 --> 26:04.604
and he has an idea

26:04.680 --> 26:06.364
that could throw the
cuffs on this fugitive

26:06.440 --> 26:07.930
before anyone else gets hurt,

26:08.000 --> 26:09.650
so please elaborate.

26:10.160 --> 26:11.491
Well, thank you, Jackie.

26:12.040 --> 26:13.849
<i>I'd just like to
tell all the folks out there</i>

26:13.920 --> 26:17.447
<i>that I'm willing to guarantee
a $100,000 cash reward</i>

26:17.560 --> 26:20.325
to any person who can bring
in the fugitive Ty Walker.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.330
Jesus Christ.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.525
You're welcome.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.409
You sensitive to odors,
Mr. Walker?

26:36.280 --> 26:37.770
As much as anyone. Why?

26:37.840 --> 26:40.650
Man I know used to smuggle weed
in trucks full of pig shit.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.523
I've seen men survive
in worse ways,

26:44.280 --> 26:46.089
but I wouldn't mind
a more appetizing option.

26:46.520 --> 26:47.851
What about Grubes?

26:48.040 --> 26:49.371
Grooves in what?

26:49.480 --> 26:51.323
Not grooves, Grubes.

26:52.040 --> 26:53.963
He's a man I know, sort of.

26:54.040 --> 26:56.202
Lives up in them hills,
like a wildcat,

26:56.280 --> 26:57.725
but he ain't no hill person.

26:57.880 --> 26:59.291
He ain't one of us, either.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.845
He'll get you to the other
side of that mountain.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.206
Of that, I'm certain.

27:02.360 --> 27:04.761
But I don't know what
he will want in return.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.086
I don't think money means so
much to a fellow like that.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.290
Well, I'm gonna
want to talk to him...

27:10.360 --> 27:11.486
Him or the pig-shit guy...

27:11.560 --> 27:13.528
Before we go to the Portal.
I want assurances.

27:13.640 --> 27:16.484
First, let's talk about how
we get into the Pizza Portal.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.883
Then we'll talk
about your assurances.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.083
We drive up, we walk in.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.890
I told you, there's no one
left to guard the place.

27:23.000 --> 27:24.206
With you and
one of your men loose,

27:24.280 --> 27:26.681
you better believe the marshals
are watching that place 24/7.

27:26.760 --> 27:28.171
Call in an anonymous tip...

27:28.240 --> 27:29.730
Ty Walker holed up across town.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.650
And whose phone
you think we gonna use

27:31.720 --> 27:33.449
to make that call, Mr. Walker?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.240
Sit tight while I
confer with my lady.

27:51.600 --> 27:52.931
One text from you,

27:53.040 --> 27:55.088
and those marshals will
go wherever you say.

27:56.240 --> 27:58.004
We can only pull this
trigger once, Boyd.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.688
I lie to Raylan like
that, and I am burned.

28:00.760 --> 28:01.886
I understand that, baby,

28:02.040 --> 28:03.724
but if we got to pull
that trigger,

28:03.800 --> 28:05.370
this is the bull's-eye
we want to hit.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.681
Now, we walk in,
we take that money,

28:07.760 --> 28:10.127
and just like that, we're gone.

28:10.840 --> 28:11.966
Boyd?

28:12.560 --> 28:13.561
Boyd!

28:13.680 --> 28:14.806
What?

28:14.920 --> 28:16.285
Car coming.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.680
Think it's that marshal
who grabbed my nuts.

28:24.280 --> 28:25.361
Shit.

28:30.280 --> 28:31.770
Raylan Givens.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.286
Look at you, hopping to
like Mr. Hospitality.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.600
Must be hiding something good.

28:35.640 --> 28:38.041
Arms aloft in a welcoming stance?
Not I.

28:38.120 --> 28:40.566
Surely something good
is going on inside.

28:40.640 --> 28:41.926
Well, you do have
a tendency to interlope

28:42.000 --> 28:43.240
in moments of high drama,

28:43.320 --> 28:45.368
but this ain't
one of those moments.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.840
Do you even know when
you're lying anymore,

28:47.880 --> 28:49.370
or is it just like blinking?

28:49.840 --> 28:51.410
What do you want, Raylan?

28:51.840 --> 28:54.411
Leftover chicken?
It's all been ate.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.323
What happened
to the big, bad man

28:56.400 --> 28:58.767
called out 24 hours
to get 'er done?

28:58.880 --> 29:00.405
Afraid I don't understand
your reference, Raylan.

29:00.480 --> 29:02.005
I'm asking where
your balls are at.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.931
You gonna
pull off the job, Boyd,

29:04.000 --> 29:05.684
or am I gonna die
of anticipation?

29:06.000 --> 29:07.525
Is that why you came?

29:07.680 --> 29:09.205
Help me find my balls?

29:09.440 --> 29:11.169
I came to tell you
I'm tired of waiting,

29:11.600 --> 29:12.965
tired of the bullshit.

29:14.280 --> 29:15.327
I been lying to you, Boyd.

29:15.440 --> 29:16.601
Well, now we're
getting somewhere.

29:16.680 --> 29:18.011
Keeping up the fiction

29:18.080 --> 29:20.367
that I got all manner of
things tying me to Kentucky...

29:20.440 --> 29:22.647
Things that forestall
my moving to Florida.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.370
But there is only
the one thing...

29:25.640 --> 29:26.687
You.

29:27.520 --> 29:29.124
You wanna lean in for a kiss?

29:29.320 --> 29:30.526
Is that what you think this is?

29:30.600 --> 29:31.681
Another one
of your love stories?

29:31.760 --> 29:33.728
Oh, well,
I do like happy endings.

29:34.160 --> 29:36.322
Well, this is one of
them classic stories,

29:36.400 --> 29:37.640
where the hero gets his man,

29:37.720 --> 29:39.324
then he rides off
into the sunset.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.329
Or maybe it's like
that other classic,

29:42.400 --> 29:44.448
where a guy chases a whale
to the ends of the earth,

29:44.640 --> 29:46.369
only to drown for his troubles.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.165
I got to admit, there's
a small part of me

29:50.240 --> 29:51.446
that's gonna miss this
when it's over.

29:53.120 --> 29:56.442
Well, don't eulogize the past
till the future gets its turn.

29:57.800 --> 30:00.690
Boyd.
Where's your head?

30:01.120 --> 30:03.043
Raylan, you want to
come in for a drink?

30:04.800 --> 30:06.370
I think I Will.

30:10.360 --> 30:11.691
See? Look.

30:12.160 --> 30:13.730
Nothing to hide.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.001
Oh. So you heard?

30:16.080 --> 30:17.570
It's quiet in here.
Voices travel.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.642
Why so quiet?
Everything okay?

30:19.760 --> 30:21.125
Everything's fine, Raylan.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.089
The lady can certainly
answer for herself.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.607
Everything fine?

30:24.760 --> 30:26.171
Yes, Raylan.
Everything's fine.

30:26.240 --> 30:27.765
You satisfied?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.365
Now, ain't you got
something better to do,

30:30.440 --> 30:33.205
like building the case against
the magnificent Boyd Crowder?

30:33.280 --> 30:34.725
Oh, I got tons to do.

30:34.800 --> 30:37.007
Like, I got to find
Avery Markham's badman.

30:37.080 --> 30:39.242
But I got a top man operating
behind the scenes,

30:39.320 --> 30:42.688
so frees me up to come here
and help you find your balls.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.161
Damn, Raylan, you in
love with my balls.

30:45.280 --> 30:47.851
You must not have heard...
Money antenna ain't shivering.

30:48.760 --> 30:52.765
$100,000 goes to whoever
helps bring in the badman.

30:53.240 --> 30:56.130
This man giving you your
money, he your new "top man"?

30:56.400 --> 30:57.765
Avery Markham himself.

30:57.840 --> 30:59.840
Markham's turning in
one of his own soldiers.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.730
Well, that's
cold-blooded, brother.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.531
Every turd with a pair of
nuts and a scatter-gun

31:04.600 --> 31:05.726
gonna be combing the countryside

31:05.840 --> 31:07.126
with dollar signs in their eyes.

31:12.160 --> 31:13.286
He's in the back.

31:32.040 --> 31:33.280
Walker! Stop!

31:41.800 --> 31:43.643
This is bullshit.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.365
You shot me in the back!

31:45.720 --> 31:47.165
You wanted to get
hit in the front,

31:47.240 --> 31:48.526
you should have run toward me.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.048
All for what, money?

31:54.320 --> 31:55.731
No.

31:58.640 --> 31:59.687
No.

32:00.200 --> 32:01.281
No.

32:01.360 --> 32:03.010
No, not just money.

32:05.600 --> 32:06.965
No.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.205
Your five minutes are up.

32:24.280 --> 32:25.691
And now it's your turn? No.

32:26.200 --> 32:27.884
Does that mean we can go now?

32:28.160 --> 32:29.400
Nobody's talking to you.

32:29.480 --> 32:32.211
Exactly, or Ms. Crowder or
the boy with the busted lip.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.407
Now, my clients were in
fear for their lives.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.687
They were not trying to
harbor a dangerous fugitive.

32:37.800 --> 32:40.121
They were trying to find a way
to notify the authorities

32:40.320 --> 32:41.685
when you showed up.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.091
And, uh...

32:43.560 --> 32:45.722
Thank you for rescuing them.

32:47.400 --> 32:48.640
You're a good lawyer.

32:48.720 --> 32:50.131
All the good ones
have ponytails.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.326
Good evening to you, too.

32:51.400 --> 32:53.209
You ain't gonna collect
your reward money, Boyd?

32:53.280 --> 32:55.408
Come on, baby.
100,000 bucks.

32:58.400 --> 33:00.607
You are so full of shit.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.684
Oh. So you don't want it?

33:03.760 --> 33:04.841
My goodness.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.611
Whoa. Hold on, now.
What's the catch?

33:08.920 --> 33:10.206
No catch.

33:12.400 --> 33:14.164
On my mama's grave.

33:21.360 --> 33:22.805
You've got to be joking me.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.648
What's important is not
who gets the reward...

33:25.720 --> 33:27.051
It is not unimportant.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.565
...but the fact
that a dangerous man

33:28.640 --> 33:31.405
has been taken off the streets
because of your generosity.

34:09.880 --> 34:11.085
Okay.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.087
Get on out of here.

34:15.159 --> 34:16.525
You sure?
Yeah.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.170
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole!

34:39.960 --> 34:41.166
Yee!

34:42.040 --> 34:43.768
Well, I was born
at night, Raylan,

34:43.840 --> 34:46.047
but I wasn't born last night.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.330
You wanted me to see that stack.

34:48.600 --> 34:49.840
That's why you pushed for this.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.888
I wanted you to get
your due reward.

34:51.960 --> 34:54.610
What happened to all that
talk about "no more lies"?

34:54.679 --> 34:56.523
Guess that was a lie.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.762
Told on your mama's grave.

34:59.480 --> 35:02.370
You know, I never put too much
stock in that kind of shit.

35:03.040 --> 35:04.280
No.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.328
Lying comes easy to both of us.

35:06.600 --> 35:07.726
Mmm.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.609
It's a hell of a stack, huh?

35:12.720 --> 35:14.688
You sure you want me
to take that bait?

35:16.200 --> 35:19.363
'Cause this fox
goes for that rabbit...

35:20.520 --> 35:22.522
...it's all over, Raylan.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.203
I tremble with anticipation.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.731
Hey, Boyd, it's us.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.163
Now, Earl, you keep
working this hard,

35:58.240 --> 36:01.244
you're gonna have a hell of a
bonus in your Christmas stocking.

36:01.760 --> 36:04.889
Now, why don't you go on home,
see about that split lip?

36:05.880 --> 36:07.211
Appreciate that, Boyd.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.964
I'd do anything for y'all.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.281
Go on.

36:14.880 --> 36:17.451
$100,000 cash.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.844
You should have seen the
look on the man's face,

36:19.920 --> 36:21.445
having to hand it over.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.002
So we got money now.
Let's go.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.444
I thought you might say that.

36:28.280 --> 36:29.645
First,

36:29.720 --> 36:31.290
I got to show you something.

36:36.520 --> 36:37.931
What is it?

36:39.280 --> 36:40.361
This is the exact size

36:40.440 --> 36:42.249
of the stack of money
in Markham's vault.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.644
It's all in hundreds, like
the bundle he gave me.

36:46.600 --> 36:47.965
God damn it.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.728
It's got to be $10 million, Ava.

36:51.320 --> 36:52.321
That's a lot of money.

36:53.320 --> 36:55.129
But a bird in the hand...

36:55.200 --> 36:57.726
$10 million is a whole
lot of birds, baby.

36:58.040 --> 36:59.485
Boyd, there's about
a hundred ways

36:59.560 --> 37:01.130
today could've gone wrong...

37:01.560 --> 37:04.211
Me back in prison
or both of us shot dead.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.891
You keep saying, "When we're
done, when we get this money."

37:08.640 --> 37:10.563
Well, we got money.
Let's go.

37:10.640 --> 37:12.529
Baby, what are we gonna
do with $100,000?

37:12.600 --> 37:14.364
What are we gonna do
with $10 million?

37:16.240 --> 37:17.685
Boyd, please.

37:18.080 --> 37:19.161
It will be enough.

37:19.240 --> 37:20.401
Baby, you know me.

37:20.480 --> 37:22.403
I have never done anything
half-measure in my life.

37:22.480 --> 37:23.561
I can't start now.

37:23.640 --> 37:25.210
Not when there's this
much meat on the bone.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.009
This is $10 million, baby.

37:27.160 --> 37:28.924
$10 million.

37:29.000 --> 37:31.287
$10 or $10 million...

37:31.440 --> 37:32.726
Would you ever
be able to walk away?

37:32.800 --> 37:34.609
Do I have a choice?
Yes.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.045
That's what this is about.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.251
Where's my phone?

37:46.440 --> 37:48.283
I need to meet Raylan.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.850
After what happened today...

37:58.600 --> 38:00.648
You ain't afraid
I'll spill my guts,

38:01.200 --> 38:03.123
beg him to pull me out?

38:03.320 --> 38:05.721
I know that you will tell
him as little as possible.

38:08.840 --> 38:11.366
I know that you love me, Ava.

38:11.440 --> 38:13.568
And I know even if you
didn't, you're a smart woman

38:13.640 --> 38:15.404
who knows a good deal
when she sees one.

38:16.080 --> 38:17.570
Now, you help Raylan
put me away,

38:17.640 --> 38:18.971
what's he got to offer you?

38:19.040 --> 38:21.088
A clean slate
in witness protection?

38:21.200 --> 38:23.567
A shitty condo in Arizona?
Little bit of money?

38:25.920 --> 38:27.490
How much money?

38:28.280 --> 38:29.566
50 grand.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.480
50 grand?

38:45.000 --> 38:46.604
There's 50 grand.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.409
And there's $10 million.

38:51.680 --> 38:53.205
Take your pick.

39:02.920 --> 39:04.251
How'd you get away?

39:04.880 --> 39:06.006
$100,000?

39:06.080 --> 39:07.366
If I succeed...

39:07.440 --> 39:10.091
If I don't lose my mind,
if I survive...

39:10.200 --> 39:11.565
I get $50,000.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.120
You give him $100,000
like it is pocket change.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.043
You get government money, Ava.

39:16.120 --> 39:17.281
That money's somebody else's.

39:17.360 --> 39:18.691
Besides, you got it
all wrong, anyway.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.923
That ain't his money. It's just...
Cheese in a trap.

39:22.080 --> 39:24.128
Goddamn right.
A $10 million hunk.

39:24.200 --> 39:25.361
So you see what I'm doing?

39:25.440 --> 39:26.680
No, I don't.
I'm confused.

39:26.800 --> 39:29.770
Who are you trying
to tempt, him or me?

39:29.840 --> 39:31.126
I mean, who do you think I am?

39:31.200 --> 39:33.202
I don't know. You tell me.
'Cause I'm just as confused.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.441
What the hell was that today?

39:34.520 --> 39:36.045
You mean besides tense?

39:36.240 --> 39:37.969
Walker in back with a gun on us?

39:38.040 --> 39:39.041
Exactly.

39:39.120 --> 39:41.043
You call me inside,
toward the gun.

39:41.120 --> 39:42.610
I was trying
to cool things down.

39:42.680 --> 39:44.489
You and Boyd were out front
about to kill each other.

39:44.560 --> 39:46.080
Boyd looked like
he was gonna kill you,

39:46.120 --> 39:47.240
you stuck your nose in there.

39:47.320 --> 39:49.163
In fact, it defies my
understanding of the man

39:49.280 --> 39:50.441
that you show up here untouched.

39:50.520 --> 39:51.646
What are you so mad for?

39:51.720 --> 39:53.051
Keep saying how you're scared,

39:53.160 --> 39:54.161
yet you don't have a scratch.

39:54.200 --> 39:55.565
It all adds up to bullshit. You
did get your man. Didn't you?

39:55.640 --> 39:56.721
Who, Walker? Jesus Christ.

39:56.800 --> 39:57.961
Oh, lord, if I knew
we were gonna argue,

39:58.080 --> 39:59.206
I would've stayed at home!

39:59.280 --> 40:00.611
What happened in Bulletville?

40:02.960 --> 40:04.166
Something happened.

40:04.240 --> 40:05.685
We went hunting.

40:06.160 --> 40:07.969
Boyd wanted
to catch opening day.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.890
We made a vacation of it.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.448
Some vacation, bleeding
and butchering hog.

40:13.320 --> 40:14.924
I'm glad I came by.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.684
So I could hear you
call me a redneck.

40:16.760 --> 40:18.569
You know what? Your neck
is just <i>as</i> red as mine.

40:18.640 --> 40:20.244
You just don't see it 'cause
you're always walking forward.

40:20.320 --> 40:21.401
How else do you walk, Ava?

40:21.520 --> 40:22.681
You know what I mean...

40:22.800 --> 40:24.484
Wishing you were better
than where you come from.

40:24.560 --> 40:25.891
Just admit something...

40:25.960 --> 40:29.043
You could've just as easily
been an outlaw as a lawman.

40:29.120 --> 40:30.929
Well, obviously, Ava.

40:31.680 --> 40:34.081
But the past is a statement.
The future is a question.

40:35.640 --> 40:37.927
The past and the future
are a fight to the death.

40:38.200 --> 40:39.645
What happened in Bulletville?

40:42.040 --> 40:44.088
You in trouble?
No.

40:44.560 --> 40:46.767
I told you. I will
dig into Zachariah.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.211
I already got to him.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.527
I already know
why Boyd needs him.

40:52.520 --> 40:54.329
You know where they're doing it?

40:54.600 --> 40:57.729
They're going up through a busted mine.
Obsidian.

40:58.600 --> 41:00.762
Up through the ground
in Blanton Creek.

41:06.680 --> 41:08.648
Why is it always
a fight with us?

41:11.120 --> 41:12.610
We're too alike, I think.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.325
<i>Good news, bad news?</i>

41:16.400 --> 41:17.925
Good news first.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.206
<i>Despite my prodding,</i>

41:19.280 --> 41:21.328
<i>I don't know when,
but I do know how.</i>

41:22.000 --> 41:23.081
How?

41:23.400 --> 41:24.890
He's coming up.

41:25.160 --> 41:28.289
The dynamite Zachariah had ain't
to blow the doors off the vault.

41:28.400 --> 41:29.890
It's for the rock below.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.443
<i>Boyd's gonna blast up
from underneath.</i>

41:33.760 --> 41:35.000
What's the bad news?

41:35.080 --> 41:36.570
<i>Ava's burned.</i>

41:39.200 --> 41:40.440
You sure?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.081
Pretty sure.

41:42.160 --> 41:43.161
<i>Damn it!</i>

41:43.240 --> 41:44.241
I know.

41:44.320 --> 41:45.890
What tipped it?

41:46.080 --> 41:47.491
<i>I just know.</i>

41:48.400 --> 41:49.765
<i>You get up here in the morning,</i>

41:49.840 --> 41:52.047
<i>hash out what the hell
we're gonna do next?</i>

41:52.120 --> 41:54.600
I'll be up around 11:00.
Something I got to do first.

42:56.480 --> 42:57.527
Nothing.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.010
What were
you expecting?

43:01.160 --> 43:02.366
Rosebud?

43:03.040 --> 43:05.088
I don't know what I
was expecting, but...

43:06.800 --> 43:08.245
It was time I looked.

43:10.440 --> 43:12.010
Took you long enough.

43:15.440 --> 43:18.091
My whole life, I had nightmares

43:18.160 --> 43:19.969
about what you
locked up in here...

43:21.200 --> 43:22.531
Slave girls...

43:24.120 --> 43:25.690
Animal for killing...

43:26.360 --> 43:28.283
Secrets, horror.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.044
And it ain't nothin'.

43:32.680 --> 43:34.125
Just like you, boy...

43:34.200 --> 43:37.124
With your head
in the goddamn clouds.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.882
You kept us
away of your 'fraidy hole

43:40.960 --> 43:43.406
like it held the treasures
of Kublai Khan.

43:45.160 --> 43:47.367
Well, it's just a
place I used to go...

43:48.160 --> 43:52.051
My place, my own dirt...

43:53.000 --> 43:55.002
Dark and far away.

43:57.360 --> 44:00.091
That's why you had the key
around your neck in the war.

44:00.720 --> 44:03.200
Wouldn't you want
to go far away from that?

44:09.720 --> 44:12.405
Every evil thing inside you,

44:13.280 --> 44:14.930
I thought was in here.

44:16.240 --> 44:19.403
And it's a big,
fat nothin'.

44:34.320 --> 44:35.810
I thought about what you said.

44:36.560 --> 44:38.767
About the idea of the remains.

44:40.160 --> 44:41.650
You're right.

44:42.520 --> 44:43.646
There's nothing left.

44:43.720 --> 44:46.291
Whatever it was, whatever
she was, it's long gone.

44:46.360 --> 44:48.089
There's still
some of him left, but...

44:49.400 --> 44:51.528
Eventually, that'll go, too.

44:53.400 --> 44:55.767
Well, are you saying
you want us to halt the work?

44:56.720 --> 44:59.803
I'm saying I won't meddle
with what's been done.

45:10.680 --> 45:12.489
Where would you
like it relocated?

45:13.360 --> 45:15.283
Your guess is as good as mine.
