00:14.200 --> 00:17.795
Why would David Palmer call my wife
about a national security threat?

00:17.880 --> 00:20.314
We can't risk having
Mrs Logan obsess about this call.

00:20.400 --> 00:24.916
If Palmer called her yesterday, our office
will have a recording of their conversation.

00:25.000 --> 00:26.149
Get that for me.

00:26.240 --> 00:29.073
Don't be concerned
that there's any connection

00:29.160 --> 00:32.391
between David's death
and the phone call he made to you.

00:32.479 --> 00:36.393
He said it was a matter of national security.
Those were his exact words.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.436
<i>Martha, it's David Palmer.</i>

00:39.720 --> 00:43.190
<i>I need to talk to you.
It's hardly a matter of national security.</i>

00:44.120 --> 00:47.476
- No, that is not what he said.
- Y es, it is.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.035
<i>I've dealt with the Martha Logan situation.</i>

00:50.120 --> 00:53.078
<i>I altered the tape of the phone call
before the president heard it.</i>

00:53.160 --> 00:57.073
There's no evidence on my end that Palmer
was trying to warn her about the attack.

00:57.400 --> 01:01.837
Sir, I think we can find Chloe.
She's accessing our system to a laptop.

01:03.240 --> 01:07.233
- What'd you get for me on Chevensky?
- He's a baggage supervisor at the airport.

01:07.320 --> 01:10.592
Jack Bauer.
Agent O'Brian.

01:10.680 --> 01:13.114
We know you're down here.

01:18.160 --> 01:20.116
Hold fire!

01:20.200 --> 01:22.111
Do not fire!

01:22.200 --> 01:23.758
What the hell's going on?

01:23.840 --> 01:27.515
Jack's being framed to cover up
the real reason Palmer was assassinated.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.158
- Where is he?
- I can't tell you.

01:29.520 --> 01:33.593
- Where's the baggage claim supervisor?
- Down that hall, to the left.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.348
Chevensky.

01:36.920 --> 01:41.311
- Why was President Palmer killed?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.517
You will tell me.
It's just a question of how much it hurts.

01:46.040 --> 01:48.600
Mom, do you see those men?

01:48.680 --> 01:52.116
- I have to warn Jack.
- Derek, where are you going? Come back!

02:03.560 --> 02:05.357
No!

02:05.440 --> 02:06.919
Quiet!

02:07.120 --> 02:08.711
Quiet!

02:10.639 --> 02:15.395
You will not be harmed as long as
your president complies with our wishes.

02:28.760 --> 02:31.399
Back up now. Back up right now.

02:33.920 --> 02:36.070
We have a critical incident in progress.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.039
I want a facility lockdown
and a code five evac right now.

02:40.120 --> 02:42.156
- Clear the area!
- My son is in there.

02:42.240 --> 02:45.357
Sorry, we're evacuating the area.
Follow these people.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.632
Grab her!

02:47.720 --> 02:50.188
I have to get my son!

02:50.880 --> 02:52.154
Derek!

02:53.160 --> 02:54.229
Derek!

02:54.320 --> 02:58.791
I have information for CTU!
My son's in there!

02:59.360 --> 03:01.510
Everyone quiet.

03:03.080 --> 03:06.993
Keep your heads down. Do not move.

03:28.360 --> 03:33.434
If you cooperate, you have a chance
of leaving this building alive.

03:33.520 --> 03:37.308
If you do not, you will die.
Do you understand?

03:39.520 --> 03:44.389
Take out all cellphones and pagers
and drop them on the floor.

03:50.960 --> 03:53.599
We're gonna be OK. We're gonna be OK.

03:54.880 --> 03:57.474
Bring them in.

03:58.800 --> 04:00.472
Move!

04:05.960 --> 04:07.757
Chevensky?

04:09.560 --> 04:11.232
Chevensky?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.478
<i>- Da.
- Well?</i>

04:21.560 --> 04:24.791
- Chevensky's not here.
- We have to find him. Keep searching.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.035
<i>- McLaren.
- Listen very carefully.</i>

04:55.120 --> 04:56.439
We have hostages.

04:56.520 --> 05:00.877
If you wish to keep them alive, you will
make no attempt to re-enter the terminal.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.838
We are wearing explosive vests.

05:03.920 --> 05:07.037
We're prepared to detonate ourselves
and our captives.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.137
If you try to
enter the terminal,

05:09.222 --> 05:12.638
you will spend the rest of
the day collecting body parts.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.231
Hello?

05:19.000 --> 05:20.991
Set up a security perimeter.

05:21.080 --> 05:24.152
We'll operate from the northwest apron
behind hangar 12.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.471
Get those fire trucks outta here!
Everybody out.

05:27.560 --> 05:31.997
Grab that woman in the yellow next to Bailey.
Bring her up here. Quick.

05:55.000 --> 05:58.072
All right. Yeah, thank you.

05:59.280 --> 06:01.510
I spoke to the director of Secret Service.

06:01.600 --> 06:05.354
Now Suvarov has arrived safely,
they're lowering their security level.

06:05.440 --> 06:08.637
We should do the same.
I'll take our tac teams off stand-by.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.029
Have we heard from the unit at the refinery?

06:11.120 --> 06:14.192
Yeah. At least that part
of Chloe's story checked out.

06:14.280 --> 06:16.874
So it's possible Jack was set up.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.633
Jack still has a lot to answer for.

06:21.360 --> 06:25.239
<i>- Buchanan.
- I have Jack Bauer on the line.</i>

06:28.360 --> 06:30.396
<i>- Put it through.
- Yes, sir.</i>

06:30.480 --> 06:33.392
Bill, put it on speakerphone.

06:34.080 --> 06:35.832
Please.

06:37.840 --> 06:38.829
Jack, it's Bill.

06:38.920 --> 06:44.552
I'm inside Ontario Airport, Gunmen have
taken over terminal one, They have hostages,

06:44.640 --> 06:48.110
- We haven't received any alerts.
- Trust me, you will.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.953
- What are you doing at the airport?
- Following a lead.

06:51.040 --> 06:54.919
Palmer knew of the planned attack.
I believe that's why he was assassinated.

06:55.000 --> 06:58.675
Interagency flash -
there's been an attack on Ontario Airport.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.275
Several men
have taken control of terminal one.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.079
Go to alert level four. Launch all tac teams.

07:05.160 --> 07:07.674
- Curtis is in the air.
- Redirect him to the airport.

07:07.760 --> 07:11.878
Have him maintain operational control
the moment he's on site.

07:11.960 --> 07:15.873
Jack, we got confirmation of the situation.
I want you out of there now.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.474
<i>Turn yourself in.
Let our people handle this.</i>

07:18.560 --> 07:23.190
Understand this, Bill - I don't work for you.
I'm staying inside.

07:23.280 --> 07:27.319
<i>You want my intel, fine.
But I'm doing this my way.</i>

07:32.840 --> 07:36.913
- How many hostiles are there?
- Approximately ten to twelve.

07:37.000 --> 07:41.232
Gunmen have locked down the terminal.
I'll send you photos of the hostiles.

07:41.320 --> 07:45.598
They should be clear enough
that you can identify them. Hold on.

07:48.680 --> 07:50.137
OK, they're transmitting.

07:50.222 --> 07:52.992
We'll forward you a
schematic of the airport.

07:53.080 --> 07:56.072
One more thing.
A woman is gonna contact you.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.993
<i>Diane Huxley,
I sent her and her son to CTU for protection.</i>

07:59.080 --> 08:01.548
<i>- Who are they?
- I don't have time to explain.</i>

08:01.640 --> 08:05.269
<i>But I'm responsible for them.
Just make sure they're safe, OK?</i>

08:05.360 --> 08:09.478
- We'll take care of them, Jack.
- Thank you. I'll be standing by.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.350
- We have to alert the president.
- Right.

08:35.760 --> 08:40.470
I want to extend my condolences
on the loss your country has suffered today.

08:40.559 --> 08:44.348
Thank you, Mr President. I hope
that what you and I accomplish here today

08:44.440 --> 08:47.637
will serve as a fitting tribute
to David Palmer's legacy.

08:47.720 --> 08:50.280
I can't imagine anything more appropriate

08:50.360 --> 08:56.230
than establishing a comprehensive
anti-terrorism alliance between our nations.

09:01.120 --> 09:03.429
- If you'd excuse me for a moment.
- Of course.

09:03.520 --> 09:05.397
Thank you.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.829
What's up?

09:08.920 --> 09:13.755
Terrorists are controlling the main terminal
of Ontario Airport in Los Angeles.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.068
Terrorists?

09:15.160 --> 09:20.234
There are eye-witness reports
of two casualties and they've taken hostages.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.395
- Who are they?
- Unclear.

09:24.480 --> 09:27.756
CTU Los Angeles is prepping a briefing.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.518
Mr President, I suggest
we move to the situation room.

09:31.600 --> 09:32.589
Now?

09:32.680 --> 09:36.878
CTU thinks this may be related to the summit.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.757
Related in what way?

09:38.840 --> 09:43.152
I don't know, sir,
but we'll find out during the briefing.

09:43.240 --> 09:45.834
<i>Mr President?</i>

09:46.560 --> 09:49.996
- Sir, we should go.
- Of course.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.038
Mr President, as you've probably
been made aware,

09:59.120 --> 10:02.749
a situation has developed
that requires my immediate attention.

10:02.840 --> 10:06.071
I have just been informed.
This is terrible news indeed.

10:06.160 --> 10:08.674
Please let me know
if there is anything I can do.

10:08.760 --> 10:10.830
I will. Thank you, sir.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.354
That's all for now.

10:13.800 --> 10:14.835
Spenser?

10:14.920 --> 10:18.549
Pulling the ground plan of the terminal
and sending it to Bauer now.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.474
Good. Edgar, were you able to identify
the terrorists from Jack's photos?

10:22.560 --> 10:25.313
Still no matches.
I tried three encoding arrays.

10:25.400 --> 10:28.472
- Widen the parameters?
- Any wider, we could use the phonebook.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.109
Hold on a second.
Try using an np-Safe adaptive search.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.431
- Are you OK?
- Thanks for asking, Edgar.

10:37.240 --> 10:41.756
Chloe, you managed to rack up
four protocol violations.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.680
It's a lot worse than that
if you count agency dot codes.

10:44.765 --> 10:46.595
It's more like 26 violations.

10:46.680 --> 10:51.834
Do you want me to figure out whose face
that is? Or I could just go wait in Holding.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.515
See what you can do.

10:55.600 --> 10:57.556
- Did it work?
- We got something.

10:57.640 --> 11:00.791
It's off an archive
from the Bureau of Continental Affairs.

11:00.880 --> 11:04.270
Anton Beresch, ex-army officer
in a Russian breakaway republic.

11:04.360 --> 11:06.749
So this is definitely to do with the summit.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.991
I'll data-mine the interagency server,
see what I come up with.

11:10.320 --> 11:14.711
DOD is receiving a localised broadcast from
the airport. The networks are picking it up.

11:14.800 --> 11:17.394
Spenser, put it on the screen.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.156
Citizens of the United States,

11:21.240 --> 11:24.357
your president and the president of Russia
have come together

11:24.440 --> 11:28.149
to sign what they have called
"an historical accord",

11:28.240 --> 11:31.516
an anti-terrorism alliance.

11:31.600 --> 11:37.869
Your leaders claim it will bring peace
and security to their respective countries,

11:37.960 --> 11:41.999
but you will soon learn
it will accomplish exactly the opposite.

11:42.080 --> 11:45.595
We are acting on behalf
of the oppressed people of our region.

11:45.680 --> 11:50.674
A people whose desire to be free
is every bit as strong as your own.

11:50.760 --> 11:55.754
We are prepared to use every means
at our disposal to achieve our goal.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.831
I have hostages.

11:57.920 --> 12:00.718
Unless President Logan
and President Suvarov

12:00.800 --> 12:07.148
make a joint statement repudiating
this accord, I will order their execution.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.515
<i>You have exactly 90 minutes.</i>

12:09.600 --> 12:11.989
We have to get this lunatic off the air.

12:12.080 --> 12:17.154
Sir, we can contact the networks, but
they're under no legal obligation to comply.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.756
<i>We take these actions knowing
that we will be called butchers.</i>

12:21.840 --> 12:24.400
But we are only responding to the violence

12:24.480 --> 12:28.029
that has been inflicted
upon our own sons and daughters.

12:28.120 --> 12:34.593
Until we as a people
achieve our own due national sovereignty,

12:34.680 --> 12:37.558
terror will be met with terror.

12:40.240 --> 12:44.119
<i>That was a live feed from Ontario
Airport in Southern California.</i>

12:44.200 --> 12:46.634
<i>As we just heard, terrorists are demanding</i>

12:46.720 --> 12:49.917
<i>that President Logan
repudiate the anti-terrorism accord.</i>

12:50.000 --> 12:55.438
This is insane. How do these people
get control of an entire airport?

12:55.520 --> 12:58.432
We've been preparing
for this summit for 16 months.

12:58.520 --> 13:00.988
Every news agency in the world is here.

13:01.080 --> 13:04.072
I've staked my entire administration
on this day,

13:04.160 --> 13:07.914
and now these people are demanding
that I go on national television

13:08.000 --> 13:10.070
and repudiate everything we've done?

13:10.160 --> 13:14.517
- Perhaps you should take a few moments...
- Mike!

13:14.600 --> 13:17.831
I want this handled. Do you understand?

13:17.920 --> 13:21.674
I don't care how you do it.
I don't care what it takes. Fix it.

13:42.680 --> 13:44.671
All right.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.037
- Go ahead.
- It's Jack.

13:54.120 --> 13:56.270
I'm staring down on the main concourse.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.512
I've got six hostiles in explosive vests.
Four are staying near the hostages.

14:00.600 --> 14:04.878
I expect their orders are to detonate if
we make a move. The other two are roaming.

14:04.960 --> 14:10.114
Two security doors on the northeast side,
both chained but currently unguarded.

14:10.200 --> 14:12.760
Get a recon unit over to the northeast wall.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.115
Jack, I need you to quarterback this.

14:15.200 --> 14:18.795
Excuse me. I got a woman, Diane Huxley,
says she has info for CTU.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.632
Diane Huxley?

14:20.720 --> 14:23.109
<i>- Curtis, did you say Diane Huxley?
- Yes, I did.</i>

14:23.200 --> 14:24.918
- Is she there?
- Yeah.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.355
- Let me speak to her.
- Bring her over.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.432
Ms Huxley, over here, please.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.239
- Hello?
- Diane, what's going on? What's wrong?

14:34.320 --> 14:38.074
- Derek is inside the terminal.
- What do you mean? I left him with you.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.628
He saw some men. He wanted to warn you.

14:40.720 --> 14:43.792
Then... I tried to go after him.
There was an explosion.

14:43.880 --> 14:47.589
- Are you sure he made it all the way inside?
- I don't know!

14:47.680 --> 14:49.432
Hold on.

15:04.560 --> 15:09.918
Keep your eyes on the floor.
Eyes down.

15:13.560 --> 15:15.551
Dammit!

15:17.080 --> 15:20.436
I see him. He's with the other hostages,
but he's not hurt.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.718
Please don't let anything happen to him.
Jack, I can't lose my son.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.030
Diane, listen to me.

15:27.120 --> 15:31.875
I promise you on my life, I am gonna get
Derek back to you. Do you understand me?

15:31.960 --> 15:35.316
- OK. OK.
- Let me speak to Curtis.

15:39.120 --> 15:40.109
Jack.

15:40.200 --> 15:44.637
I need to ask you a favour.
Let Ms Huxley stay at the command post.

15:44.720 --> 15:48.315
You got it. Let me know
if the hostiles adjust their profile.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.676
Copy that. I'll get back to you.

15:54.440 --> 15:56.635
Son of a bitch.

16:17.080 --> 16:20.356
His name is Anton Beresch.
He's a member of the Dawn Brigade -

16:20.440 --> 16:23.876
separatists blamed
for numerous terrorist bombings in Russia.

16:23.960 --> 16:27.999
Precisely the kind of organisation
today's accord was designed to combat.

16:28.080 --> 16:31.914
Bill, I have no intention
of calling off this signing.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.514
So you have 90 minutes
to rescue the hostages.

16:34.600 --> 16:38.752
We're operating under that timetable.
We're making an on-site assessment.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.434
Spare the agency patter. Just get it done.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.351
Sir, you need to be aware.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.671
<i>We should be prepared
for additional civilian casualties.</i>

16:48.760 --> 16:51.115
- More casualties?
- It's a possibility.

16:51.200 --> 16:54.192
I'm not prepared to accept any such thing.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.794
Bill, it's your job to get them out alive.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.394
The terrorists are wearing explosive vests.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.740
They've threatened
to detonate themselves

17:01.825 --> 17:04.270
if any attempt is made
to retake the terminal.

17:04.359 --> 17:08.194
- I'm aware of the situation.
- Have you tried initiating a dialogue?

17:08.280 --> 17:11.352
Yes, what about talking to them?
Have you tried that?

17:11.440 --> 17:15.718
Beresch called an airport sergeant -
a blocked number, but we're back-tracing it.

17:15.800 --> 17:18.108
Whatever you do, just do it by the deadline.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.613
When I sign that accord,
I do not want it to be

17:20.698 --> 17:22.829
the death warrant of
innocent Americans.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.036
Yes, Mr President.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.917
- Got the number?
- We just completed the back-trace.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.797
Try it.

17:36.560 --> 17:38.755
We're all gonna die.

17:38.840 --> 17:42.230
It's gonna be OK. It's gonna be OK.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.234
Yes?

17:47.320 --> 17:51.518
This is Bill Buchanan, director
of the Los Angeles Counter Terrorist Unit.

17:51.600 --> 17:52.669
I'm listening.

17:52.760 --> 17:57.072
The president authorised me to speak for him.
I hope we can resolve this peacefully.

17:57.160 --> 18:01.711
I told you how to resolve this peacefully.
Your president must make a public statement.

18:01.800 --> 18:05.793
- He's considering that option.
- We have nothing more to speak about.

18:05.880 --> 18:09.316
There must be some other way
we can address your demands.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.073
I don't think you understand
how serious we are.

18:12.160 --> 18:14.674
I know the president...

18:17.040 --> 18:19.713
- Data-mine that call.
- Yes, sir.

18:20.320 --> 18:22.629
Get up! Up!

18:23.640 --> 18:25.358
Bring him.

18:25.440 --> 18:27.874
Curtis, they're moving one of the hostages.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.276
On your knees.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.033
Oh, my God.

18:52.480 --> 18:55.711
Please. I have a wife.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.799
So do I.

18:59.600 --> 19:01.716
No...

19:45.880 --> 19:47.711
You.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.519
No!

19:49.960 --> 19:53.873
They're moving another hostage.
I can't see where. I'm changing position.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.674
I'm watching. Yeah. OK.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.156
- Derek?
- Ma'am... Please, ma'am.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.550
That's my son. They're gonna kill my son!

20:21.640 --> 20:24.996
- That's my son!
- She can't watch this. Get her out of here.

20:25.080 --> 20:27.275
No! Let me go!

20:27.360 --> 20:30.272
Let me go! No!

20:36.920 --> 20:42.392
In 15 minutes, your president will get
another demonstration of our commitment.

20:42.480 --> 20:44.072
15 minutes.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.755
- I'm in position. How long till you're ready?
- A half-hour.

20:47.840 --> 20:51.469
- We're still transferring personnel.
- Too long. Advance your attack.

20:51.560 --> 20:54.472
- We're just not ready.
- They're gonna kill that kid.

20:54.560 --> 20:59.350
Jack... I heard that woman Diane's
side of the conversation.

20:59.440 --> 21:04.355
This has nothing to do with her. They'll
continue to kill hostages until the deadline.

21:04.440 --> 21:07.876
We can't risk the lives
of all those hostages for one kid.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.474
Just tell your men to hurry.

21:10.560 --> 21:12.835
<i>They will.</i>

21:37.840 --> 21:43.153
<i>Until we as a people
achieve our own due national sovereignty,</i>

21:43.240 --> 21:45.754
<i>terror will be met with terror.</i>

21:45.840 --> 21:48.149
It's all connected.

21:48.240 --> 21:52.631
<i>Threatening to execute
a second hostage in less than 15 minutes.</i>

21:52.720 --> 21:55.188
<i>There 's been no reaction
from the president...</i>

21:55.280 --> 21:58.511
Maybe that's enough.
The doctor said you shouldn't...

21:58.600 --> 22:02.309
Evelyn, David Palmer called me last night.

22:03.120 --> 22:08.911
He said he had something to tell me.
It was a matter of national security.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.992
I think it has something to do with this.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.155
- The terrorists?
- Yes.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.391
I tried to tell my husband
and Walt Cummings.

22:18.480 --> 22:20.710
They think I imagined the call.

22:20.800 --> 22:25.237
So he checked the phone recordings.
The conversations don't match.

22:25.320 --> 22:27.914
Someone altered the conversation, Evelyn.

22:29.000 --> 22:31.912
Who would do something like that?

22:32.000 --> 22:33.991
I don't know.

22:37.680 --> 22:39.352
Listen to me.

22:39.440 --> 22:43.991
You have got to cover for me. No one
can know I am gone. Do you understand me?

22:46.000 --> 22:48.468
Where are you going?

23:14.560 --> 23:17.154
<i>- O'Brian.
- Chloe, is that you?</i>

23:17.240 --> 23:21.233
- Why are you answering the phone?
- Mr Buchanan needed my help.

23:21.320 --> 23:22.912
- Are you alone?
- Yeah.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.754
I'm gonna send a picture of one
of the hostiles to your screen. Hold on.

23:30.680 --> 23:35.674
- OK. I got it.
- Enlarge the upper right corner of his vest.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.958
Looks like a secondary detonator,
cellphone activated.

23:43.040 --> 23:46.350
So the leader can set off the charges
if anybody gets cold feet.

23:46.440 --> 23:48.186
I need the
detonation frequency.

23:48.271 --> 23:50.831
I'll have to ID the detonator.
Could take time.

23:50.920 --> 23:54.230
<i>- Just get started.
- Did you clear this with Buchanan?</i>

23:56.400 --> 23:58.470
No.

23:58.560 --> 24:01.313
Chloe, can you see the live feed?

24:04.720 --> 24:06.950
Oh, my God. It's Derek.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.830
I need your help.

24:09.920 --> 24:11.911
OK. I'll get back to you.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.551
Spenser.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.790
I was really worried about you.

24:18.880 --> 24:24.512
Not now. I need you to reconfigure
Jack's phone to emit an alternate signal.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.356
- What for?
- Could you just work up a procedure?

24:33.440 --> 24:36.113
This is off-protocol, isn't it?

24:37.160 --> 24:38.673
Yes.

24:38.760 --> 24:42.992
Spenser, you know more about
bandwidth processing than anyone here.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.960
I need you.

25:02.840 --> 25:05.035
Got it?

25:06.360 --> 25:08.191
Yeah.

25:16.920 --> 25:21.869
It's Agent Pierce. I'm here
to escort Mrs Logan to the Garden Room.

25:27.320 --> 25:29.231
She's still not ready.

25:29.320 --> 25:35.429
President Logan is expecting her 15 minutes
before the ceremony. Could I speak with her?

25:43.440 --> 25:45.715
What's going on?

25:45.800 --> 25:47.916
She's in one of her moods.

25:48.000 --> 25:51.117
If you push her, you'll make her worse.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.998
- I'll wait out here.
- Thanks.

26:22.360 --> 26:25.033
- It's Mr Burk, isn't it?
- Uh, Mrs Logan...

26:25.120 --> 26:28.749
- You work in the communications office?
- Yes, ma'am.

26:28.840 --> 26:34.631
I know all phone conversations are recorded.
Where do they keep those recordings?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.647
Well, the calls are
recorded onto a hard drive.

26:41.732 --> 26:43.636
It's part of the
central server.

26:43.720 --> 26:46.188
Is there by any chance any hard copies?

26:46.280 --> 26:50.068
Actually, the president insists
on written transcripts as backups.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.913
- He's kind of old-fashioned that way.
- I know.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.788
- Where do they store those transcripts?
- Archive room down the hall.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.519
- Can you show me?
- Access is restricted. Uh...

26:59.600 --> 27:02.114
- I'm the first lady.
- I understand, Mrs Logan.

27:02.200 --> 27:05.397
But there are security requirements.
You need an entry card.

27:05.480 --> 27:07.391
Do you have one?

27:07.480 --> 27:09.516
- Well, yes, I do...
- Can I borrow it?

27:09.600 --> 27:12.319
It's extremely important.

27:13.160 --> 27:17.711
Mrs Logan, I'm sorry.
Um, there's nothing I can do.

27:17.800 --> 27:22.237
Mr Burk, we can continue this little dance
if you really want to,

27:22.320 --> 27:25.312
but you and I both know
I am going to get into that room.

27:25.400 --> 27:29.871
So you can save us both the trouble
and just give me your entry card.

27:29.960 --> 27:33.714
- Mrs Logan, you wouldn't...
- You know, in three seconds, Mr Burk,

27:33.800 --> 27:38.555
I am going to scream louder than any woman
you have ever heard in your life.

27:38.640 --> 27:41.393
One, two...

27:41.480 --> 27:43.596
Here's the card right here.

27:43.680 --> 27:46.035
Thank you. Thank you.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.549
I'll return it very soon.

28:17.400 --> 28:21.075
- O'Brian.
- Derek has three minutes. I need a frequency.

28:21.160 --> 28:24.835
- We're trying to find the manufacturer.
- We're running out of time.

28:24.920 --> 28:28.071
If we get the frequency wrong,
we could detonate all the vests.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.549
I can't find a match
on any Czech components.

28:30.640 --> 28:35.191
That leaves the German manufacturers.
Jack, we're trying to narrow it down.

28:40.480 --> 28:44.359
The first team enter through
the southeast door and split into two flanks.

28:44.440 --> 28:47.079
Primary killshots,
take out hostiles in bomb vests.

28:47.160 --> 28:51.551
Second team enters and forms
a protective ring around the hostages.

28:51.640 --> 28:56.589
We'll only have a few seconds to neutralise
the hostiles, so find your targets fast.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.113
Go.

28:58.800 --> 29:02.236
- What's your time frame?
- On target to launch assault in 15 minutes.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.753
Understood.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.756
How old are you?

29:19.560 --> 29:21.835
15.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.832
Try to control your breathing.

29:26.040 --> 29:28.076
Slow down.

29:32.920 --> 29:36.151
See? Better.

29:38.120 --> 29:40.111
Please don't kill me.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.915
That's up to your president.

29:57.160 --> 30:02.234
- Bill Buchanan.
- Beresch is calling from the airport, sir,

30:03.760 --> 30:05.273
This is Bill Buchanan.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.397
The boy hasn't long to live.

30:08.480 --> 30:11.040
No word from the president yet.
We need more time.

30:11.120 --> 30:15.910
No. The president must announce
the summit is cancelled, or I kill the boy.

30:16.000 --> 30:18.833
We're doing our best
to get an answer from the president.

30:18.920 --> 30:22.629
I implore you to resolve this
without further killing.

30:22.720 --> 30:25.234
This boy's blood will be on his hands.

30:28.200 --> 30:29.428
Come on, Chloe.

30:29.520 --> 30:33.149
We found the manufacturer.
We're trying to figure out the frequency.

30:33.240 --> 30:36.312
- No match on the 2004 series.
- It's gotta be one of these three.

30:39.440 --> 30:41.635
Hold him.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.151
Agent Manning.

30:47.640 --> 30:48.834
I got it.

30:48.920 --> 30:52.117
Here it is.
Go to submenu three on your phone.

30:52.200 --> 30:55.636
- I'm at submenu.
- Enter this code - 6339.

30:56.400 --> 30:57.443
Now what?

30:57.534 --> 30:59.915
The phone needs to
reboot. It'll say "Ready."

31:00.000 --> 31:03.276
Then press the star key
and it should set off the detonator.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.234
Your president has abandoned you.

31:08.320 --> 31:12.108
- I'm not getting a ready signal.
- It takes time to reflash the ROM.

31:14.080 --> 31:16.992
Son of a bitch. Come on.

31:17.080 --> 31:19.071
I'm sorry.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.560
I got it. I got it.

31:32.080 --> 31:35.516
- Curtis, what was that?
- There was an explosion in the terminal.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.033
Patch me through to Jack.

31:38.920 --> 31:41.718
Stay in position!
Keep the hostages together!

31:41.800 --> 31:45.156
Check the exits.
Make sure the perimeter's secure.

31:54.400 --> 31:56.789
It was lbrim's vest.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.314
It must have detonated by accident.

31:59.400 --> 32:01.994
- What's going on?
- A terrorist's vest blew up.

32:02.080 --> 32:06.392
- None of the hostages were hurt.
- Were you responsible for that, Jack?

32:06.960 --> 32:08.791
Jack, answer me!

32:09.400 --> 32:12.551
They were gonna kill another hostage.
I had no choice.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.517
I didn't compromise my position.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.672
Now tell me this -
are Curtis and his team on schedule?

32:17.760 --> 32:20.991
- Yes. Go time is ten minutes.
- OK.

32:21.080 --> 32:26.313
Everyone, pull into formation B
and run circuit checks on your vests.

32:26.920 --> 32:31.471
The terrorists are revising their formation.
I'll contact Curtis with final positions.

32:31.560 --> 32:32.470
Thanks, Jack.

32:34.680 --> 32:39.276
<i>Mr Buchanan,
President Logan's on the line for you.</i>

32:41.080 --> 32:42.069
Mr President.

32:42.160 --> 32:45.675
The news is saying there was
an explosion inside the terminal.

32:45.760 --> 32:50.231
Everything's under control, sir. Our units
are in position. Go time is ten minutes.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.039
- Then what caused the explosion?
- We're not certain.

32:53.120 --> 32:56.749
We believe our man inside
may have been trying to stall the execution

32:56.840 --> 32:59.115
and he triggered the bomb vest of a hostile.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.794
Did you authorise this action?

33:02.800 --> 33:06.759
No, sir. He acted independently.

33:06.840 --> 33:11.038
You should know, Mr President,
the man we're talking about is Jack Bauer.

33:11.120 --> 33:12.109
Jack Bauer?

33:12.200 --> 33:17.399
He was in the terminal when the terrorists
attacked. He's been helping us from inside.

33:17.480 --> 33:21.075
I thought that... Jack Bauer
assassinated David Palmer.

33:21.160 --> 33:24.675
There's evidence to suggest
that Bauer may have been framed.

33:24.760 --> 33:27.752
- What evidence?
- It's complicated, Mr President.

33:27.840 --> 33:29.512
Why am I only hearing this now?

33:29.600 --> 33:32.279
I didn't want to distract
you with details that

33:32.364 --> 33:34.958
can wait till we resolve
the hostage situation.

33:35.040 --> 33:38.635
You tell me everything
and I will decide which details are relevant.

33:38.720 --> 33:42.110
- With respect, we don't have time.
- Then talk faster!

34:09.000 --> 34:13.152
Mrs Logan is due in the Garden Room
right now. Open the door, please.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.197
Just a few more minutes.

34:16.280 --> 34:18.635
Ma'am, it's my job to make sure she's there.

34:18.719 --> 34:22.871
If you don't open the door,
I will open it myself.

34:24.880 --> 34:28.350
- Mrs Logan?
- How dare you barge in here.

34:30.080 --> 34:33.469
- Mrs Logan?
- This is a private residence.

34:33.560 --> 34:38.634
Evelyn, if something happens to Mrs Logan,
the blame will fall on you. We both know that.

34:38.719 --> 34:44.989
So I am urging you in the strongest
possible terms to tell me where she is.

35:02.600 --> 35:06.673
We're moving to entry positions.
Davies, Matthews, are your teams in place?

35:06.760 --> 35:09.433
<i>All teams in place.
Ready to go, Agent Manning.</i>

35:09.520 --> 35:11.909
All right, copy. Go.

35:15.720 --> 35:18.188
- Oh, my God.
- It's OK. Listen. Derek's alive.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.191
- He's OK.
- Are you sure?

35:20.280 --> 35:22.999
I can't go into details, but he's OK.

35:23.080 --> 35:26.993
I have to go.
We're mounting our rescue operation.

35:27.560 --> 35:30.199
Keep an eye on her. Let's go.

35:44.160 --> 35:47.914
They're waiting for you
in the Garden Room, Mrs Logan.

35:48.760 --> 35:51.752
- I can get up myself.
- All right.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.752
You still need to come with me.

35:54.840 --> 35:58.515
Whatever you say, Aaron.
Whatever you say.

36:17.960 --> 36:20.520
- I'm so sorry, Mrs Logan.
- It's all right.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.229
- I'm really sorry.
- Will you stop apologising? It's annoying.

36:24.320 --> 36:27.039
Besides, I got what I came for.

36:41.920 --> 36:44.639
<i>- Yes?
- You have a problem at the terminal.</i>

36:44.720 --> 36:46.790
<i>- Explain.
- Jack Bauer is inside.</i>

36:46.880 --> 36:50.919
providing recon for CTU's rescue operation,
which will launch shortly.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.673
- Are you sure?
- This came from the director of CTU.

36:53.760 --> 36:58.038
<i>And Bauer was responsible for detonating
the vest of one of Beresch's men.</i>

36:58.120 --> 37:00.873
<i>- Can you tell me Bauer's precise location?
- No.</i>

37:00.960 --> 37:03.474
But he has a connection
to one of the hostages.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.950
<i>A 15-year-old boy named Derek Huxley.</i>

37:09.480 --> 37:11.471
I have to go.

37:12.280 --> 37:17.718
Yes, tell him that's being handled
out of the press office. Thank you.

37:17.800 --> 37:21.429
- Yes?
- Mrs Logan is back in her room getting ready.

37:21.520 --> 37:25.593
- Why the delay?
- She was in one of the archive rooms.

37:25.680 --> 37:29.229
Archive rooms? What was she doing there?

37:30.600 --> 37:35.594
The first lady is safe and accounted for.
You'll need to ask her anything beyond that.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.636
Thank you, Aaron.

37:45.520 --> 37:47.511
C Team.

37:52.440 --> 37:56.194
Go to the ticket counters. The west exit.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.598
- Manning.
- This is Jack.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.956
Beresch has redeployed six men.
Ready for final positions?

38:10.040 --> 38:11.439
Go ahead.

38:11.520 --> 38:14.671
Four men were deployed to the east side,
the ticket counters,

38:14.760 --> 38:18.196
the other two to the west side
in front of the emergency exits.

38:18.280 --> 38:19.269
Copy.

38:19.360 --> 38:23.148
OK, once you deploy I'll give you
real-time updates on their positions.

38:23.240 --> 38:28.109
All right, Jack, I'm starting the countdown.
All teams, stand by to execute.

38:29.560 --> 38:31.516
This is it.

38:38.093 --> 38:40.502
<i>- Is in terminal now.
- OK.</i>

38:42.040 --> 38:44.235
Hostages up!

38:44.320 --> 38:46.390
Hold on one second.

38:51.960 --> 38:53.678
Hold on.

38:54.080 --> 38:57.356
Hold on. Beresch is changing something.

38:58.680 --> 39:02.070
<i>Jack? Jack?</i>

39:02.160 --> 39:04.435
- Curtis, what happened?
- I lost Jack.

39:04.520 --> 39:07.432
- What do you mean?
- The connection's broken.

39:07.520 --> 39:09.590
- Can you reconnect?
- I'm trying.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.436
Jack Bauer.

39:20.840 --> 39:23.308
Derek is a very brave young man.

39:24.160 --> 39:29.154
I will shoot him in the head
if you don't show yourself immediately.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.276
<i>- Curtis!
- It's not going through.</i>

39:31.360 --> 39:35.114
- Can you move in without him?
- Jack said Beresch was moving something.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.431
He could be moving the hostages
into the kill zone.

39:38.520 --> 39:39.475
Abort.

39:39.560 --> 39:42.518
All teams, abort the operation.
Repeat - abort.

39:44.480 --> 39:50.112
<i>Bauer, if you want to save the boy,
present yourself now.</i>

40:11.160 --> 40:13.799
Mr Bauer.

40:13.880 --> 40:16.633
Derek has five seconds left to live.

40:17.400 --> 40:19.789
Four, three...

40:19.880 --> 40:21.791
Beresch!

40:27.160 --> 40:29.594
I'm lowering my weapon.

40:33.240 --> 40:35.231
Secure him.
