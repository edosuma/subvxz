WEBVTT

01:27.792 --> 01:29.626
I uh...

01:29.661 --> 01:32.556
Uh, he was asking if we have
any family left in Romania.

01:32.592 --> 01:34.135
You don't speak Romanian?

01:34.637 --> 01:37.204
Um, no, I don't. Sorry.

01:42.005 --> 01:43.600
Hey, easy.

01:48.980 --> 01:50.246
What did he say?

01:50.282 --> 01:52.447
-He said he hates you.

01:52.482 --> 01:54.722
No, no, no,
I say you are beautiful.

01:54.757 --> 01:57.224
<i>-Frumoasa.</i>
<i>-Frumoasa.</i>

01:59.089 --> 02:00.986
<i>Foarte frumoasa.</i>

02:05.935 --> 02:07.993
-Thank you.

02:11.837 --> 02:13.207
Oh...

02:25.215 --> 02:26.410
Is this it?

02:26.679 --> 02:28.651
Uh... I think so.

02:46.333 --> 02:47.571
Julia.

03:09.764 --> 03:12.123
Hey, not bad.

03:20.106 --> 03:21.638
Hm, it's from work.

03:25.704 --> 03:27.072
You don't like?

03:27.673 --> 03:29.778
No. No, it's lovely.

03:30.444 --> 03:33.084
Um...<i> frumoas--</i>

03:33.119 --> 03:35.218
<i>-Frumoasa.</i>
<i>-Frumoasa.</i>

04:03.049 --> 04:04.918
I smell like plane.

04:04.953 --> 04:07.954
Oh, well, that's my favorite.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.289
Stale peanuts and
sweaty strangers.

04:10.324 --> 04:12.524
Why did she think
I didn't like the place?

04:13.555 --> 04:15.194
Because you smile too much.

04:15.630 --> 04:18.027
Are you telling me that
I walk around grinning
like an idiot?

04:18.063 --> 04:19.190
Only around me.

04:23.334 --> 04:25.669
Mm... you're insufferable.

06:44.044 --> 06:45.479
Can't sleep?

06:48.915 --> 06:50.011
No.

06:51.448 --> 06:53.081
Sorry if I woke you.

06:53.217 --> 06:54.279
Come here.

07:03.222 --> 07:05.158
When do you have to wake up
tomorrow?

07:06.394 --> 07:07.424
Early.

07:08.501 --> 07:10.504
Wake me up before you leave,
okay?

07:10.904 --> 07:12.099
Okay.

07:14.270 --> 07:15.509
I will.

07:22.113 --> 07:23.517
Oh...

07:49.202 --> 07:51.007
<i>I'm learning Romanian.</i>

07:55.007 --> 07:57.375
<i>She is a beautiful woman.</i>

08:01.618 --> 08:03.986
<i>She is a beautiful woman.</i>

08:14.365 --> 08:16.735
<i>I eat carrots.</i>

08:28.709 --> 08:31.079
<i>I eat carrots.</i>

08:47.393 --> 08:49.264
<i>I would like to see a movie.</i>

08:56.841 --> 08:59.373
<i>Maria drinks coffee</i>
<i>with her father.</i>

09:07.122 --> 09:09.920
Uh...<i> un cafea va rog.</i>

09:11.189 --> 09:12.157
<i>O cafea.</i>

09:12.192 --> 09:13.750
<i>O cafea.</i> Sorry.

09:14.086 --> 09:15.556
No, your accent is great.

09:15.591 --> 09:16.887
Thank you.

09:16.923 --> 09:19.032
<i>O cafea cu lapte?</i>

09:19.067 --> 09:20.595
<i>Da, cu lapte.</i>

10:28.437 --> 10:31.168
Hey, hey!

10:31.204 --> 10:32.871
I'm sorry.

10:33.139 --> 10:34.367
Sorry.

11:24.383 --> 11:26.522
Um, I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

11:30.894 --> 11:33.231
-Oh, the light.
-The light. Yes.

11:33.267 --> 11:35.296
Okay. Thank you.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.477
-Hello, darling.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.152
Any reason in particular
you're standing in the dark?

13:03.820 --> 13:05.991
Just people watching.

13:09.429 --> 13:10.496
How was work?

13:10.531 --> 13:12.063
Exhausting.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.659
But good.

13:20.869 --> 13:21.974
Is this for me?

13:22.541 --> 13:23.701
It's for you.

13:25.479 --> 13:26.704
It's kind of silly.

13:28.182 --> 13:29.212
Yes.

13:30.483 --> 13:32.677
It is. Very silly.

13:33.882 --> 13:35.053
And I love it.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.362
For you.

13:47.796 --> 13:48.935
What is it?

13:50.464 --> 13:53.062
It's a...
It's a symbol.

13:53.231 --> 13:54.941
A symbol of what?

13:55.641 --> 13:57.507
That spring has arrived.

13:57.843 --> 14:00.045
-Isn't it obvious?

14:23.767 --> 14:24.905
What's happening?

14:30.609 --> 14:31.769
They're not sure.

15:05.878 --> 15:07.904
-Hey.
-Hey, come look at this.

15:12.416 --> 15:14.317
I think this is what we
passed by the other night.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.423
What are they saying?

15:21.821 --> 15:23.793
They're talking about
the last time she was seen.

15:24.062 --> 15:26.494
-She was murdered?
-So it seems.

15:29.563 --> 15:32.038
That guy was there.
What is he saying?

15:33.969 --> 15:35.371
He found the body.

15:36.004 --> 15:37.071
How did she, uh--

15:40.415 --> 15:41.542
They didn't say.

15:44.784 --> 15:46.283
They're gonna be here at- 00.

15:49.356 --> 15:50.514
Okay.

15:50.749 --> 15:53.219
I can't figure out if
Simion likes me

15:53.254 --> 15:56.121
or if he thinks I'm an idiot.

15:56.757 --> 15:58.656
I swear, every time I think
I'm getting in with him,

15:58.691 --> 16:00.759
he shuts the door in my face
like I'm...

16:00.794 --> 16:03.894
fuckin' Diane Keaton
at the end of<i> The Godfather.</i>

16:10.509 --> 16:11.737
Hey.

16:13.677 --> 16:14.839
What?

16:16.175 --> 16:17.347
What's up?

16:18.319 --> 16:19.580
Nothing.

16:26.852 --> 16:29.359
There's this guy that lives
across the street,

16:30.326 --> 16:31.823
and he's always
looking over here.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.431
Looking in over here how?

16:36.300 --> 16:39.198
Every time I look over there,
he's just...

16:39.233 --> 16:40.433
standing in his window

16:40.469 --> 16:42.207
and it's like he's
staring right at me.

16:44.238 --> 16:45.408
Which window is it?

16:52.750 --> 16:54.010
Right there.

16:58.226 --> 17:00.921
-I can't see anything.
-Because it's day.

17:01.357 --> 17:03.553
He only looks in at night?

17:03.755 --> 17:05.396
I can only see him at night.

17:05.865 --> 17:08.068
Doesn't mean that he's not...

17:09.737 --> 17:11.303
You know what?
Forget it.

17:11.538 --> 17:13.133
No. Come on.

17:13.602 --> 17:15.465
If you're feeling uncomfortable
about something,

17:15.500 --> 17:16.674
we should talk about it.

17:16.709 --> 17:18.309
Really. I'm fine.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.907
So you're Diane Keaton now?

17:22.510 --> 17:24.909
Mm-hm. That's exactly
what I said.

17:38.926 --> 17:41.360
I'm-- I'm sorry, I was just
telling your husband that

17:41.395 --> 17:42.898
he needs some new accounts.

17:43.133 --> 17:44.603
What else do they have you on?

17:44.639 --> 17:46.434
Uh... Frosty Cakes,

17:46.469 --> 17:48.434
and some company
that sells office supplies

17:48.470 --> 17:50.836
-marketed towards women.

17:50.871 --> 17:53.274
You just need to make
a better impression on Simion.

17:53.476 --> 17:54.838
Oh, that's a really good idea.
Thank you.

17:54.873 --> 17:56.147
-I hadn't thought of that.

17:56.183 --> 17:59.178
And don't confuse
<i>chinui</i> with<i> se chinui.</i>

17:59.413 --> 18:01.945
-What happened?

18:01.981 --> 18:04.690
Nothing, I just made this
silly mistake earlier

18:04.725 --> 18:05.958
during a presentation

18:05.993 --> 18:08.059
and I'm never gonna hear
the end of it.

18:08.095 --> 18:09.794
He was
trying to say to a client

18:09.830 --> 18:11.029
that he'd fight for them,

18:11.065 --> 18:12.860
but instead he said
he'd torture them.

18:19.171 --> 18:21.371
Oh, uh, is it okay if
I smoke in here?

18:21.407 --> 18:24.600
Uh, well, Julia gave up smoking
a few months ago.

18:24.836 --> 18:26.712
Really? I don't see you
as a smoker.

18:26.747 --> 18:28.272
I'm trying not to be.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.646
-I-- I don't have to.
-No. No, really.

18:30.948 --> 18:32.083
It's totally fine.

18:32.118 --> 18:33.449
I don't want to be
a bad influence.

18:33.484 --> 18:35.417
-No, it-- it's fine.
-All right. Thanks.

18:35.452 --> 18:37.182
Francis told us
you're an actress.

18:37.484 --> 18:40.021
Oh, um, yeah.
I-- I was.

18:40.256 --> 18:42.022
-Um...

18:42.191 --> 18:43.795
Wasn't really for me,

18:43.831 --> 18:46.663
so I'm, um, reevaluating.

18:47.966 --> 18:50.893
Uh, Jules and I had
an interesting experience
the other night, didn't we?

18:50.928 --> 18:52.170
We were walking
just a few blocks away,

18:52.205 --> 18:54.163
we go past this crime scene,
a bunch of cops.

18:54.198 --> 18:56.236
This afternoon, we turn on
the news and there it is.

18:56.271 --> 18:59.102
-What happened?
-They found a woman
murdered in her apartment.

18:59.137 --> 19:01.841
-Yeah, you heard about it too?

19:08.149 --> 19:09.222
Bullshit.

19:12.284 --> 19:13.655
What?

19:17.726 --> 19:19.932
Do I need to leave so
the grownups can talk?

19:20.168 --> 19:22.763
They're saying the woman
had her head cut off.

19:24.396 --> 19:26.736
-You didn't tell me that.
-They didn't say anything
about that.

19:27.339 --> 19:29.438
It must be related to
the other attacks.

19:29.474 --> 19:32.440
So, uh, they found a woman
about a month ago

19:32.475 --> 19:34.207
with her throat slit
in her apartment

19:34.243 --> 19:35.541
around the same age.

19:35.577 --> 19:38.148
So, but this one,
he cut so deep,

19:38.184 --> 19:40.150
it was essentially
a decapitation.

19:40.186 --> 19:41.851
They're calling him
The Spider.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.302
-Do you need help?
-No, no, no, I'm fine.

20:50.954 --> 20:52.116
<i>Scuzi.</i>

20:53.785 --> 20:55.086
You must be the new neighbor.

20:55.828 --> 20:57.360
Oh, yeah.

20:57.395 --> 20:59.123
-You two just moved in, right?
-Yeah.

20:59.833 --> 21:00.927
Can you hear me?

21:01.629 --> 21:03.803
Um, yes,
your English is perfect.

21:03.838 --> 21:05.467
Thank you, but I meant

21:05.502 --> 21:06.838
can you hear me
inside my apartment?

21:07.106 --> 21:09.939
Oh, um... no.
Not really.

21:09.974 --> 21:11.036
Hm.

21:11.570 --> 21:12.935
Can you hear us?

21:12.971 --> 21:15.608
No. You are
suspiciously quiet.

21:15.644 --> 21:17.517
And I love you for this.

21:17.819 --> 21:19.509
-I'm Irina.
-Julia.

21:20.245 --> 21:23.117
Just bang on my wall if
I'm ever making too much noise.

21:23.153 --> 21:24.456
Okay.

22:13.137 --> 22:17.033
<i>I woke up and saw a man</i>
<i>standing over me in the dark.</i>

22:17.068 --> 22:18.769
<i>He put a pillow case</i>
<i>over my head</i>

22:18.804 --> 22:20.204
<i>so I couldn't see his face.</i>

22:22.208 --> 22:24.714
<i>He held a knife to my throat</i>
<i>and pressed down.</i>

22:25.976 --> 22:27.385
<i>I thought I was going to die</i>

22:27.420 --> 22:29.713
<i>because I felt it</i>
<i>going into my skin.</i>

22:29.748 --> 22:31.223
<i>But then he stopped</i>

22:31.259 --> 22:33.283
<i>and just sat next to me,</i>
<i>watching me.</i>

22:34.724 --> 22:36.759
<i>It felt like he was there</i>
<i>for hours.</i>

22:42.193 --> 22:44.399
<i>I think he was</i>
<i>watching me before.</i>

22:44.434 --> 22:46.230
<i>I just had a sense that...</i>

22:47.570 --> 22:49.805
<i>someone was always behind me,</i>

22:51.011 --> 22:52.445
<i>even when I was alone.</i>

24:14.754 --> 24:16.820
<i>Where is it, lady?</i>

24:16.856 --> 24:17.992
<i>I don't know.</i>

24:22.103 --> 24:23.268
<i>Give it to me.</i>

24:23.304 --> 24:26.363
-<i> It's mine!</i>
-<i> No!</i>

24:27.636 --> 24:30.339
<i>Peter! Peter!</i>

24:30.374 --> 24:32.237
<i>A man tried to kill me!</i>

24:56.971 --> 24:58.230
<i>Peter?</i>

25:00.137 --> 25:01.431
<i>Peter?</i>

25:03.001 --> 25:04.676
<i>Peter, are you all right?</i>

25:06.912 --> 25:09.942
<i> Lock the door.</i>
<i>Don't let anyone in except me.</i>

25:09.977 --> 25:11.710
<i>And close these windows</i>
<i>after me.</i>

25:11.745 --> 25:13.543
<i>Be careful.</i>

25:13.578 --> 25:15.811
<i>You just took the words</i>
<i>right out of my mouth.</i>

25:40.575 --> 25:42.615
Uh... Marlboro.

25:53.922 --> 25:56.662
Uh, no, I'm-- I'm good.
Thank you.

28:22.441 --> 28:23.799
-Hey!

28:24.669 --> 28:27.311
-Is-- Is there a back door?

28:35.556 --> 28:36.819
Simion says
they like to be wooed,

28:36.854 --> 28:38.555
so we're going to headquarters
in Sofia

28:38.591 --> 28:40.058
to do the whole
song and dance.

28:40.728 --> 28:42.454
I don't know yet if it's
gonna be Nicolae or me.

28:44.429 --> 28:45.556
That's great.

28:49.269 --> 28:50.330
You're not hungry?

28:52.206 --> 28:54.301
Uh... not really.

28:57.741 --> 29:00.371
This, uh, weird thing happened.

29:00.407 --> 29:03.544
Um... there was this guy
at the movie theater,

29:03.580 --> 29:06.451
and then he...

29:06.487 --> 29:08.315
followed me into
the supermarket.

29:11.390 --> 29:12.451
Followed you?

29:13.390 --> 29:14.453
Yeah.

29:16.925 --> 29:18.028
Did he say something to you?

29:19.330 --> 29:20.866
Uh, no.

29:21.233 --> 29:22.362
No.

29:26.835 --> 29:27.873
Did he follow you here?

29:28.474 --> 29:29.974
No, I don't think so.

29:41.287 --> 29:42.382
You okay?

29:44.091 --> 29:45.121
Yeah.

29:46.154 --> 29:47.992
I think I just need to
sleep it off.

29:50.428 --> 29:51.556
Come here.

29:53.624 --> 29:56.192
the good news is,
if he ever comes here,

29:56.627 --> 29:58.871
you have your big strong man
to protect you.

30:01.141 --> 30:02.230
Okay.

30:02.800 --> 30:05.702
I'm gonna pretend you didn't
just laugh at that.

30:14.617 --> 30:15.712
I'm sorry.

30:18.786 --> 30:20.090
No, um...

30:21.190 --> 30:23.156
No, you--
you don't have to apologize.

30:23.191 --> 30:24.628
I don't know why
I reacted like that.

30:24.663 --> 30:27.196
No, no, I-- I totally get it.

30:31.233 --> 30:33.568
Do you want to go back to
the supermarket?

30:34.171 --> 30:36.040
I mean, they gotta have
security tapes, right?

30:57.357 --> 30:58.730
He thought you were
trying to steal.

30:58.765 --> 31:00.193
Oh, I wasn't trying to
steal something.

31:00.228 --> 31:01.962
There was a man
that was following me,

31:01.997 --> 31:03.232
I was just trying
to hide.

31:12.438 --> 31:13.709
Uh, what time were you in?

31:13.745 --> 31:15.706
Uh, around four, I think.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.083
What'd he look like?

31:26.118 --> 31:28.259
Uh, he was white,

31:28.295 --> 31:30.419
mm, older.

31:30.454 --> 31:32.322
He was wearing a brown jacket.

31:37.370 --> 31:38.465
No.

31:56.983 --> 31:58.023
That's him.

32:06.994 --> 32:08.429
Oh, okay, watch.

32:17.102 --> 32:18.208
Wait for it.

32:24.241 --> 32:25.314
Just wait.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.286
There. See?

32:36.795 --> 32:38.459
He's staring right at me.

32:39.600 --> 32:42.034
Maybe, or...

32:43.534 --> 32:44.663
Or what?

32:45.633 --> 32:48.502
Or he's staring at the woman
who's staring at him.

33:40.420 --> 33:41.852
You gonna be okay?

33:42.695 --> 33:44.558
Of course. I'll be fine.

33:46.156 --> 33:47.723
I have to go to dinner
with some clients tonight,

33:47.758 --> 33:49.134
so I'm gonna be out
kind of late.

33:50.667 --> 33:51.730
Okay.

33:58.545 --> 33:59.771
Bye.

34:51.057 --> 34:52.131
Hey.

34:54.234 --> 34:56.300
I was just wondering when
you're gonna be back home.

34:59.001 --> 35:00.304
Yeah, I figured.

35:01.907 --> 35:03.439
Do you know when you'll be back?

35:05.074 --> 35:06.970
No, it's just, um...

35:10.609 --> 35:12.481
No, it's fine.
Um, it's fine.

35:14.988 --> 35:16.782
Yeah, I'll see you
when you're back.

35:21.021 --> 35:22.117
You too.

36:56.615 --> 36:58.218
I'm sorry, I don't understand.

37:10.867 --> 37:11.901
I--

37:13.939 --> 37:15.536
-Elvis?
-Elvis.

37:15.571 --> 37:18.574
-It's her cat.

37:19.473 --> 37:22.145
-What?
-Elvis is her cat.

37:22.448 --> 37:24.281
He's gone missing and
she's trying to find him,

37:24.316 --> 37:25.944
and she wants to know
if you've seen him.

37:27.450 --> 37:29.519
Uh, I'm sorry,
I-- I haven't seen him.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.653
Oh...

37:44.801 --> 37:47.731
Poor Eleonora. That cat is
always trying to escape her.

37:47.767 --> 37:49.840
Thanks, by the way.

37:50.275 --> 37:52.402
My husband usually translates,
but...

37:52.438 --> 37:53.477
still at work.

37:53.913 --> 37:55.272
Working at 10 p.m.?

37:55.507 --> 37:56.640
Is he a stripper?

37:56.675 --> 37:58.916
No, no, works in marketing.

37:58.951 --> 38:00.451
-With a client.
-Mm.

38:03.013 --> 38:04.785
Do you feel like
coming in for a drink?

38:05.951 --> 38:07.784
I feel like another one,
and it's less sad

38:07.820 --> 38:09.452
if there's another person
with me.

38:09.654 --> 38:11.052
-Yeah. Sure.
-Yeah?

38:11.088 --> 38:12.454
Sure. Yeah.
That sounds nice.

38:12.489 --> 38:13.530
Okay.

38:22.536 --> 38:24.640
-Come in.

38:32.010 --> 38:33.751
I should have
stayed out longer.

38:33.987 --> 38:35.915
I look radiant with vodka.

38:42.026 --> 38:43.362
Do you like port?

38:43.862 --> 38:45.056
Yeah. Sure.

38:49.529 --> 38:50.658
<i>-Noroc.</i>
<i>-Noroc.</i>

38:53.839 --> 38:55.539
See? You do.

38:56.174 --> 38:57.739
I'm trying to learn.

38:58.539 --> 39:00.541
I wanted to surprise Francis.

39:00.676 --> 39:03.442
One day, just say something
very casually.

39:04.012 --> 39:06.041
-So your husband's Romanian?

39:06.177 --> 39:08.915
Uh, his mother is but
he grew up in the US.

39:10.687 --> 39:13.450
And he brought you back to
the home country.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.459
Yeah. Got a promotion,

39:15.495 --> 39:18.188
and they needed someone in
the Bucharest office.

39:19.824 --> 39:21.257
It must be hard for you, though.

39:22.929 --> 39:24.903
It was hard for me
when I first moved away.

39:25.505 --> 39:28.564
I studied ballet in London
before I injured my knee.

39:28.766 --> 39:30.601
My English was terrible.

39:30.937 --> 39:32.806
I fell madly in love with it
eventually,

39:32.842 --> 39:35.744
but the first few months,
I was terribly lonely.

39:36.278 --> 39:37.581
Yeah, me too.

39:38.116 --> 39:39.407
Definitely be lonely.

39:40.243 --> 39:41.915
At least you have
your husband with you.

39:45.392 --> 39:47.156
I'm sorry, did I say something
to upset you?

39:47.191 --> 39:49.058
-No.
-Are you sure?

39:51.798 --> 39:53.223
Irina.

40:07.409 --> 40:09.242
Is everything okay?

40:09.411 --> 40:11.406
Yeah. It's just my ex.

40:12.579 --> 40:14.747
He sounds kind of scary.

40:14.782 --> 40:17.052
Yeah, he just sounds like that.

40:17.088 --> 40:18.149
It's all a show.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.317
He's actually very sweet.

40:22.295 --> 40:24.687
Anyway, he knows not to
cross the line.

40:24.723 --> 40:25.992
And what if he does?

40:30.628 --> 40:31.668
I'm serious.

40:34.334 --> 40:35.507
Open it.

40:41.572 --> 40:43.042
Whoa.

40:43.077 --> 40:45.246
He gave it to me as a present
when we were together

40:45.281 --> 40:46.817
to defend myself.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.977
I think he regrets it now
but, uh,

40:49.013 --> 40:50.451
it just makes it
easier for me

40:50.487 --> 40:51.984
to tell him to
go fuck himself.

40:52.020 --> 40:54.320
I should tell more people
to go fuck themselves.

40:54.522 --> 40:55.783
-You should.
-Mm-hm.

40:56.286 --> 40:58.391
You should say...

41:02.597 --> 41:04.265
-Perfect!

42:17.207 --> 42:18.577
Fuck this.

42:30.623 --> 42:33.251
You're not really
looking in here, are you?

43:31.412 --> 43:32.508
Jules?

44:06.517 --> 44:08.049
What's goin' on?

44:12.954 --> 44:14.924
I saw the man
in the window again.

44:20.023 --> 44:21.700
I waved at him.

44:25.864 --> 44:27.266
And he waved back.

44:39.009 --> 44:40.081
Which one is it?

44:40.980 --> 44:42.380
One floor up to the left.

44:45.050 --> 44:46.651
His light's off.

44:46.687 --> 44:48.089
He's in there.

44:50.095 --> 44:51.587
Don't--

44:59.172 --> 45:00.530
Do you see him?

45:05.268 --> 45:06.801
No, I can't see anything.

45:07.004 --> 45:08.439
It's too dark.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.371
I want to call the cops.

45:10.407 --> 45:12.751
-Is that really necessary?
-Yes.

45:13.883 --> 45:15.881
So he followed you
from the theater

45:15.916 --> 45:17.547
across the street to the market?

45:18.916 --> 45:19.989
I think so.

45:21.084 --> 45:22.255
You think so?

45:31.736 --> 45:33.904
Mm-hm.
Can you describe him please?

45:34.438 --> 45:35.631
I have a photo.

45:40.980 --> 45:43.444
So you think this is
the same man you saw
in the window?

45:43.613 --> 45:44.948
I think it could be.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.178
You could identify his face
in a window

45:48.214 --> 45:49.821
in the building
across the street?

45:51.124 --> 45:52.280
Not exactly.

45:52.582 --> 45:55.123
It was dark.
It was his silhouette mostly.

45:56.321 --> 45:58.423
-Mostly?
-Look, this isn't normal.

45:59.566 --> 46:01.690
He's always there
looking in here.

46:02.797 --> 46:05.931
I-- I can feel him.

46:05.967 --> 46:07.795
Okay. Okay, okay.

46:07.831 --> 46:10.136
I'll go over there, see if
he's looking in the window.

46:10.171 --> 46:12.610
That's not polite, so...
I'll talk with him.

46:12.645 --> 46:14.569
If you want,
you can come with me,

46:14.604 --> 46:16.910
see if it's the same man
as in the picture,

46:16.946 --> 46:19.609
so I think so can become
yes or no.

46:21.082 --> 46:22.447
I don't think that's
a good idea.

46:23.355 --> 46:24.889
I'll go.

46:25.986 --> 46:27.320
I'd like to get a look at him.

46:28.186 --> 46:29.924
Maybe I could just hang back,

46:29.960 --> 46:31.357
get a glance of him
around the corner.

46:31.922 --> 46:33.161
Right?

46:34.299 --> 46:35.328
Yeah, sure.

47:37.824 --> 47:39.062
Was it him?

47:46.769 --> 47:48.236
Francis, was it him?

47:52.439 --> 47:55.045
Listen to me for a second.
Even if it was him,

47:55.847 --> 47:57.409
the guy lives in
our neighborhood.

47:57.678 --> 48:00.978
It's not crazy to think
that he'd be shopping at
the same store.

48:01.547 --> 48:04.648
I need you to stop
rationalizing this all away.

48:07.452 --> 48:09.059
You want me to
stop being rational?

48:09.094 --> 48:12.459
To just jump to
the craziest conclusion
like you?

48:12.762 --> 48:14.297
You think I'm crazy?

48:14.433 --> 48:16.995
No, I think--

48:17.030 --> 48:18.494
I think you're stressed,

48:18.529 --> 48:20.397
and you're alone here
all day long--

48:20.432 --> 48:21.766
-Stop.
-You're in this new country--

48:21.801 --> 48:22.999
Stop!

48:23.601 --> 48:26.307
Stop talking to me like
I'm a fucking child.

48:36.215 --> 48:38.720
I can't-- I can't stay here.

48:38.755 --> 48:40.684
-Julia.

48:40.987 --> 48:42.518
I want to leave.

48:42.553 --> 48:44.894
Leave, like pack our bags
right now?

48:44.929 --> 48:47.063
You want to head to a hotel
or-- or,

48:47.099 --> 48:49.264
what, you want to get on a plane
back to New York?

48:50.562 --> 48:52.627
Please, just tell me
what you want me to do?

48:52.662 --> 48:54.536
I want you to
fucking believe me!

48:54.572 --> 48:55.930
God.

48:58.008 --> 48:59.805
This is just
a bad night, Jules.

49:00.007 --> 49:01.870
It's not a bad night.

49:04.311 --> 49:07.313
I can't think here,
I can't breathe,

49:07.348 --> 49:10.516
I mean, I-- I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

49:13.790 --> 49:15.554
What-- What can I do?

49:16.529 --> 49:18.029
What can I do to help?

49:25.964 --> 49:27.203
Nothing.

49:54.725 --> 49:56.166
Hey, Jules, I'm headin' out.

53:36.283 --> 53:37.750
Do you speak English?

53:38.723 --> 53:39.917
Yes.

53:41.255 --> 53:42.491
What is this place?

53:43.925 --> 53:45.296
Museum.

53:46.963 --> 53:48.263
It's a museum?

53:48.298 --> 53:50.994
No.
Museum, it's a club.

53:53.972 --> 53:55.900
-Can I go in?
-Yeah, sure.

55:20.384 --> 55:21.920
Julia?

55:27.031 --> 55:28.322
You followed him here?

55:30.533 --> 55:32.926
Francis thinks that
I'm overreacting.

55:33.229 --> 55:35.164
But he's been watching us
since we moved in.

55:37.370 --> 55:38.505
Do you know him?

55:38.540 --> 55:40.372
I think he works here
as a cleaner.

55:40.641 --> 55:42.345
People come and go here
all the time.

55:42.381 --> 55:44.677
I never really get a good look
at their faces.

55:44.712 --> 55:47.117
They all have
the same dumb expression,

55:47.153 --> 55:48.584
and they start to
blend together.

55:49.653 --> 55:52.115
Have you noticed anyone
watching you in your apartment?

55:53.516 --> 55:55.018
No.

55:55.054 --> 55:57.219
But maybe I've gotten used to
having eyes on me.

56:03.002 --> 56:04.699
Do I just sound paranoid?

56:06.370 --> 56:08.131
Let's just hope
you'll never find out.

56:09.239 --> 56:10.471
The best outcome might be

56:10.506 --> 56:12.300
having to live with
the uncertainty.

56:13.345 --> 56:15.910
Better than getting raped
and strangled,

56:15.945 --> 56:18.678
and dying with the words
"I told you so" on your lips.
Right?

56:22.848 --> 56:24.752
Sorry. I have to
get back to work.

56:30.458 --> 56:31.990
Thank you for looking after me.

56:33.727 --> 56:35.158
I'll try and do
the same for you.

58:52.896 --> 58:53.896
-Irina?

58:55.570 --> 58:57.300
-Irina?

58:58.069 --> 58:59.907
-Irina?

59:05.750 --> 59:08.510
I heard yelling. I heard
screaming from in here, okay?

59:08.545 --> 59:10.651
-If we can just get
the key.

59:10.920 --> 59:12.486
-He's hurting her, okay?

59:12.521 --> 59:14.024
Can we get the key, please?

59:15.854 --> 59:17.424
Just open the door, please!

59:37.273 --> 59:39.309
I heard the scream
from the bedroom.

1:00:01.171 --> 1:00:02.299
It was cat.

1:00:11.646 --> 1:00:14.652
Elvis. Elvis.

1:00:39.036 --> 1:00:40.468
What did she say?

1:00:40.803 --> 1:00:43.538
She said
she didn't want tenants
who created trouble.

1:00:46.151 --> 1:00:47.641
I can imagine.

1:00:52.821 --> 1:00:54.516
I'm sorry I've been
working so much.

1:00:55.325 --> 1:00:56.655
It's your job.

1:00:57.224 --> 1:00:59.995
I know but
you moved here to be with me.

1:01:00.398 --> 1:01:02.524
Well, that's presumptuous.

1:01:03.194 --> 1:01:05.534
Maybe I've always
wanted to live

1:01:05.570 --> 1:01:07.797
an aimless existence
in Bucharest

1:01:07.832 --> 1:01:09.034
smoking cigarettes

1:01:09.069 --> 1:01:12.202
and scaring my neighbors
with my hysterics.

1:01:12.405 --> 1:01:14.536
You thought she needed help.
I don't blame you for it.

1:01:17.847 --> 1:01:20.482
I gotta go into work
for a few hours today,

1:01:20.517 --> 1:01:22.753
but we have cocktails tonight.

1:01:24.083 --> 1:01:26.383
-If you're up for it.
-Yeah, I'm good.

1:01:32.025 --> 1:01:33.797
Hi.
<i>Vorbesti engleza?</i>

1:01:33.833 --> 1:01:36.227
I was wondering if you know
a woman that works there?

1:01:36.263 --> 1:01:38.800
Her name's Irina.
She didn't come home last night

1:01:38.836 --> 1:01:41.038
and I was just wondering
if you've heard from her

1:01:41.073 --> 1:01:42.267
or seen her?

1:01:45.839 --> 1:01:48.779
Okay. All right.
Thank you.

1:02:00.524 --> 1:02:01.957
Are you looking for Irina?

1:02:03.592 --> 1:02:04.754
You know where she is?

1:02:05.223 --> 1:02:07.494
No, I just saw her last night
at work.

1:02:08.297 --> 1:02:11.131
We were supposed to meet
at my apartment
after she finished.

1:02:12.567 --> 1:02:13.804
She never came?

1:02:15.235 --> 1:02:18.574
It's not the first time,
but, no, she never came.

1:02:18.610 --> 1:02:20.707
Do you know
where she would be?

1:02:20.743 --> 1:02:22.144
I think she's inside.

1:02:22.881 --> 1:02:24.579
I don't think so.
I would have heard her come in.

1:02:24.614 --> 1:02:26.242
Do you have her phone number?

1:02:26.277 --> 1:02:28.778
Yeah, but...
she doesn't answer me.

1:02:29.214 --> 1:02:30.821
Do you mind if
I try and call her?

1:02:31.749 --> 1:02:32.823
Yeah.

1:02:48.835 --> 1:02:50.764
Mm-hm. You hear that?

1:03:00.184 --> 1:03:01.280
Wait.

1:03:05.019 --> 1:03:06.384
Could you help me
with something?

1:03:25.875 --> 1:03:28.104
So you want me to
knock on his door

1:03:28.139 --> 1:03:29.913
and get the guy to come out?

1:03:30.944 --> 1:03:33.081
Yeah, I just need to see him.

1:03:34.209 --> 1:03:35.949
-Why?

1:03:35.984 --> 1:03:37.880
I think that he's been
following me.

1:03:38.349 --> 1:03:39.913
The police say
they can't do anything,

1:03:39.948 --> 1:03:43.153
but I need to know for myself
that it's the same person.

1:03:43.189 --> 1:03:45.929
-Fucking cops are useless.

1:03:57.243 --> 1:03:58.535
So which one?

1:03:59.972 --> 1:04:02.011
Hm... that's the corner.

1:04:04.514 --> 1:04:05.608
That one there.

1:04:06.549 --> 1:04:07.610
Four doors down.

1:04:08.418 --> 1:04:09.513
On the left?

1:04:10.045 --> 1:04:11.119
Yeah.

1:04:34.172 --> 1:04:35.638
I think there is someone inside.

1:04:36.239 --> 1:04:37.981
But they don't answer.

1:04:48.625 --> 1:04:50.455
Uh, sorry, I gotta go.

1:04:51.519 --> 1:04:53.095
Can you just try one more time?

1:04:54.859 --> 1:04:55.999
Okay.

1:05:18.753 --> 1:05:21.024
Sorry. I tried.

1:05:21.823 --> 1:05:23.961
Wh-- What did you say?

1:05:25.122 --> 1:05:27.196
Uh...

1:05:27.565 --> 1:05:29.032
To stop bothering you.

1:05:29.599 --> 1:05:30.831
But don't worry.

1:05:31.066 --> 1:05:33.201
He probably has
a little crush on you.

1:05:36.739 --> 1:05:39.537
Um, if you see Irina,

1:05:40.106 --> 1:05:41.638
can you tell her that I came by?

1:05:42.306 --> 1:05:44.179
-Okay.

1:06:53.375 --> 1:06:55.382
I'm sorry. Sorry.

1:07:58.814 --> 1:08:00.073
Julia?

1:08:20.805 --> 1:08:23.269
Julia, this is Daniel Weber.

1:08:23.304 --> 1:08:25.703
He lives in the building
across from you.

1:08:27.639 --> 1:08:30.310
Mr. Weber made a complaint
with us today

1:08:30.346 --> 1:08:32.779
about a neighbor who has been
harassing him.

1:08:33.315 --> 1:08:34.974
-Harassing him?
-Yeah.

1:08:35.010 --> 1:08:37.747
Looking at his window,
following him around,

1:08:37.783 --> 1:08:40.448
showing up at his door and
threatening his father.

1:08:40.817 --> 1:08:43.656
And I remember Mr. Weber
from your complaint,

1:08:43.691 --> 1:08:47.264
and I wanted to resolve this
before it goes any further.

1:08:47.299 --> 1:08:52.202
So if you both can agree that
this was misunderstanding,

1:08:53.170 --> 1:08:55.396
and, uh, that's not gonna go
any further,

1:08:55.598 --> 1:08:57.537
we can all go on with our lives.

1:09:39.884 --> 1:09:41.251
Let me know when they're gone.

1:09:54.590 --> 1:09:55.694
You okay?

1:10:01.431 --> 1:10:02.965
I saw this today.

1:10:08.570 --> 1:10:09.838
What is this?

1:10:09.873 --> 1:10:11.414
It says they caught
The Spider.

1:10:11.883 --> 1:10:13.415
Remember the guy who found her?

1:10:13.949 --> 1:10:15.112
He was a plumber.

1:10:15.447 --> 1:10:17.047
Did a job for the last victim.

1:10:17.917 --> 1:10:19.979
They found
a bunch of her clothes
in his apartment.

1:10:20.015 --> 1:10:21.786
He'd already been in prison
for rape.

1:11:04.561 --> 1:11:06.798
Simion. My wife, Julia.

1:11:07.801 --> 1:11:10.073
She is as beautiful
as you described her, Francis.

1:11:10.108 --> 1:11:11.933
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

1:11:11.968 --> 1:11:14.435
We were just talking about
the big news.

1:11:14.737 --> 1:11:16.511
Did Francis get a promotion?

1:11:17.246 --> 1:11:18.645
No, no,
they caught The Spider.

1:11:18.680 --> 1:11:20.983
So Francis and Julia
live near one of the victims.

1:11:21.018 --> 1:11:22.479
So they saw the crime scene.

1:11:22.514 --> 1:11:24.217
We just walked past it, really.

1:11:24.252 --> 1:11:25.447
-Oh.
-That's all

1:11:35.157 --> 1:11:36.790
Francis said that
you are having some trouble

1:11:36.825 --> 1:11:37.895
with one of your neighbors.

1:11:40.464 --> 1:11:41.537
Maybe it was him.

1:11:42.006 --> 1:11:44.070
Can you imagine?

1:12:17.238 --> 1:12:18.441
What did you just say?

1:12:20.044 --> 1:12:21.906
It's just a stupid work joke.

1:12:23.511 --> 1:12:25.575
-What did he say?
-Jules. Come on.

1:12:25.978 --> 1:12:28.245
No, no, really, it was just
some office gossip.

1:12:28.814 --> 1:12:31.449
How about more champagne?
I need a refill.

1:12:31.484 --> 1:12:34.347
At least I have The Spider to...

1:12:35.993 --> 1:12:37.592
-To what?
-Julia.

1:12:38.559 --> 1:12:40.122
At least I have
The Spider to...

1:12:41.933 --> 1:12:43.400
to keep me company?

1:12:44.265 --> 1:12:45.435
Is that what you...

1:12:53.604 --> 1:12:54.906
At least I have that.

1:13:02.452 --> 1:13:03.752
Julia, where are you going?

1:13:04.188 --> 1:13:06.379
-Will you please stop?
-What?

1:13:07.849 --> 1:13:09.149
I can't take a joke?

1:13:09.185 --> 1:13:10.559
Is that what you're gonna
tell me right now?

1:13:15.091 --> 1:13:16.763
I don't know
what to do anymore, Julia.

1:13:20.871 --> 1:13:22.098
I'm tired.

1:13:24.405 --> 1:13:25.838
I'm tired of feeling like this

1:13:25.873 --> 1:13:28.335
because you can't let go of
some fuckin' fantasy.

1:17:46.195 --> 1:17:47.836
It's probably an animal.

1:17:48.665 --> 1:17:49.767
What?

1:17:49.803 --> 1:17:51.936
The cause of the delay.

1:17:51.971 --> 1:17:54.304
It could be signal problem
or repairs

1:17:54.340 --> 1:17:57.571
or sometimes it's because
an animal is on the tracks.

1:17:59.517 --> 1:18:01.811
There could be a couple
subway workers

1:18:01.847 --> 1:18:03.577
chasing a dog as we speak.

1:18:07.321 --> 1:18:09.049
So...

1:18:09.084 --> 1:18:10.556
how long does it take?

1:18:10.591 --> 1:18:12.390
To catch a dog?

1:18:12.426 --> 1:18:13.895
Not long.

1:18:14.528 --> 1:18:15.589
If you're fast.

1:18:19.493 --> 1:18:21.430
Usually, it just takes
a few minutes.

1:18:22.933 --> 1:18:24.532
Even if it seems longer.

1:18:26.175 --> 1:18:27.403
Thanks.

1:18:27.871 --> 1:18:29.042
You're welcome.

1:18:33.450 --> 1:18:35.312
Why are you following me?

1:18:36.684 --> 1:18:38.612
I don't control the trains.

1:18:42.721 --> 1:18:43.826
Let me explain.

1:18:44.595 --> 1:18:47.492
I spend all day
looking after my father,

1:18:47.528 --> 1:18:48.831
he's very sick.

1:18:50.125 --> 1:18:52.494
And so sometimes I...

1:18:53.194 --> 1:18:55.101
go to the window and...

1:18:57.737 --> 1:18:59.468
just look at people...

1:19:00.443 --> 1:19:01.943
going about their day.

1:19:03.546 --> 1:19:05.980
I know it is a sad hobby.

1:19:08.982 --> 1:19:12.646
But no one
has really noticed before.

1:19:14.925 --> 1:19:18.190
"You've really become
sad old man now," I thought.

1:19:19.659 --> 1:19:21.857
Dreaming up a...

1:19:21.893 --> 1:19:24.367
pretty girl who's...

1:19:24.402 --> 1:19:27.463
finally looking back at you.

1:19:30.671 --> 1:19:32.204
But then you waved.

1:19:34.905 --> 1:19:36.939
And I thought...

1:19:36.974 --> 1:19:38.872
that you were saying...

1:19:38.907 --> 1:19:39.948
hello.

1:19:43.511 --> 1:19:45.983
That's why I was so--
so surprised

1:19:46.019 --> 1:19:48.918
when your husband
came to my door

1:19:48.953 --> 1:19:50.721
with the police officer.

1:19:50.757 --> 1:19:53.286
I did not understand

1:19:53.322 --> 1:19:55.128
what I had done
that was so bad.

1:19:56.357 --> 1:19:58.626
And why you kept following me.

1:20:00.002 --> 1:20:03.169
I wondered if you were
trying to embarrass me.

1:20:05.104 --> 1:20:08.303
Or if you were
trying to scare me...

1:20:08.338 --> 1:20:10.671
when you came to my door
with that man...

1:20:11.778 --> 1:20:15.346
and cursed at my father.

1:20:16.611 --> 1:20:19.587
I had hoped that
after I involved the police

1:20:19.622 --> 1:20:21.418
that would be the end of it.

1:20:21.687 --> 1:20:23.318
But I felt--

1:20:23.353 --> 1:20:25.389
I felt that
what I really needed...

1:20:29.025 --> 1:20:30.526
was an apology.

1:20:35.470 --> 1:20:36.598
I'm sorry.

1:23:38.047 --> 1:23:39.187
Irina?

1:24:53.261 --> 1:24:55.531
Be careful about
breathing too hard.

1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.134
I left enough holes
for you to get air,

1:24:58.169 --> 1:25:00.803
but you will pass out if you
start hyperventilating.

1:25:00.838 --> 1:25:02.869
-Or scream.

1:25:02.904 --> 1:25:04.772
Help! Help!

1:25:04.807 --> 1:25:06.607
-Shh. Shh.

1:25:06.643 --> 1:25:08.001
Irina screamed.

1:25:09.980 --> 1:25:12.038
We had to hide
in that closet...

1:25:13.247 --> 1:25:15.217
while you were all
looking around.

1:25:17.186 --> 1:25:19.947
For a moment, I was sure
that you'd see me.

1:25:23.153 --> 1:25:25.156
Imagine...

1:25:25.192 --> 1:25:27.196
how awkward that
would have been.

1:25:40.202 --> 1:25:41.301
Hello.

1:25:52.856 --> 1:25:54.553
-Julia?
-He--

1:26:25.082 --> 1:26:26.222
Julia?

1:26:41.395 --> 1:26:42.469
Fuck.

1:30:22.055 --> 1:30:23.118
Hey!
