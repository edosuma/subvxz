WEBVTT

00:01.459 --> 00:02.127
Mistress:
Previously on "The Outpost"...

00:02.168 --> 00:04.713
- You summoned another demon?
- And a Blackblood.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.507
- Your ears?
- I cut the points off.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.010
The last two Blackbloods I met

00:10.051 --> 00:11.845
killed innocent people
I cared about.

00:11.886 --> 00:13.847
They were Blackfist.
They believe the only way

00:13.888 --> 00:15.432
to free our people is to
wipe out all of the humans.

00:15.473 --> 00:17.851
Mind control?
So that's what you kinj does.

00:20.145 --> 00:22.647
I am honored to bow
before The Three.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.648
I thought you were dead.

00:25.650 --> 00:28.486
A very large Prime Order army
are only a day's march away.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.321
We don't have enough men
to fight this battle.

00:33.491 --> 00:34.951
The Blackblood will summon
the slayers of men.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.703
Hell of a time
to call me back.

00:36.745 --> 00:37.954
Start calling names.
We need help.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.081
( speaking Blackblood )

00:41.624 --> 00:43.209
Why did you bring
the Blackfist through?

00:43.251 --> 00:44.627
- We're all Blackbloods.
- So what are you saying?

00:44.669 --> 00:45.670
You're all our prisoners.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.921
And from this point forwards,

00:46.963 --> 00:48.715
this is our outpost.

01:06.691 --> 01:10.320
If you humans
want to eat tonight,

01:10.361 --> 01:11.988
you'll start working faster.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.453
The sooner you find
what we're looking for,

01:18.495 --> 01:21.748
the sooner
you can eat and rest.

01:21.790 --> 01:22.415
Get to work!

01:26.669 --> 01:28.004
Wish I knew what
we were looking for.

01:37.847 --> 01:39.057
Pick it up
and keep working.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.352
Hey! His hands are frozen.

01:42.393 --> 01:44.437
Get him some gloves!

01:44.479 --> 01:49.317
He can work until
his hands fall off.

01:49.359 --> 01:52.028
- Sammy!
- Don't do anything
stupid, Garret.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.740
( shouting )

02:00.620 --> 02:01.704
Hey!

02:12.549 --> 02:14.050
Stop!

02:19.472 --> 02:22.308
Your standing orders
were to keep them alive
and well enough to work.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.728
This human attacked
an overseer.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.938
He must be punished.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.023
Looks like you've done that.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.199
Does anyone else
want to make trouble?

02:40.160 --> 02:42.078
Good.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.086
( groans )

03:07.395 --> 03:08.938
Man: Keep moving.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.443
Keep moving! Faster! Go!

03:17.405 --> 03:20.116
You need to put a leash
on your Blackfist.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.910
Dead humans are of
no use to us.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.704
You command your Blackbloods.
I'll command the Blackfist.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.789
You're under my command,
Yobahn.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.499
That's how Yavalla wants it.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.637
Yobahn:
Their Queen should be long dead.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.680
Her very existence
is a threat to our order.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.641
The Queen's well-being is
the only thing keeping order.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.937
You kill her, and she will
rise up against you.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.981
And why should
we listen to you?

03:52.023 --> 03:53.441
Because she
understands the humans

03:53.483 --> 03:54.859
better than any of us.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.028
Every Blackfist wants
the Queen's death.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.364
I don't know how long
I can hold them back.

04:02.242 --> 04:05.370
( music playing )

04:16.422 --> 04:18.341
What were you thinking,
Spears?

04:18.383 --> 04:20.510
He did what was necessary.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.846
Garret, you better
start getting along
before they kill you.

04:23.888 --> 04:27.892
I will not stand by while
they beat innocent people.

04:27.934 --> 04:31.688
I can take care of myself.
You didn't need to intervene.

04:31.729 --> 04:34.774
It's been 39 days
since Talon brought
the Blackbloods through.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.401
( whispers )
39 days!

04:38.695 --> 04:40.655
When are we putting
our plan in action?

04:40.697 --> 04:42.156
Spears and I can get
the Queen out.

04:42.198 --> 04:44.575
Out of her chambers,
not out of the Outpost.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.745
- We'll figure that part out.
- Until you do, you're not
going off half cooked.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.580
You'll get yourself
and Queen Rosmund killed.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.499
We should have never
trusted Talon.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.335
- No.
- She's a filthy Blackblood
through and through.

04:54.377 --> 04:57.922
As I recall, it was you
who agreed with her

04:57.964 --> 04:59.465
that she should bring
the Blackbloods

04:59.507 --> 05:01.092
and their demons through
to fight for us.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.969
Can we not rehash this?

05:11.311 --> 05:13.062
( gasps )

05:16.357 --> 05:19.193
Let someone else do this.
You need to heal.

05:19.235 --> 05:22.405
I can't just sit
and do nothing.

05:24.657 --> 05:26.743
Spears, I'm still
your ranking officer.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.828
We'll wait
for the right opportunity.

06:05.990 --> 06:09.786
For the sins
of your ancestors.

06:09.827 --> 06:10.870
Kezzun!

06:12.997 --> 06:14.290
Remove your sword.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.554
Your orders were
that she not be harmed.

06:30.473 --> 06:31.682
Now get out.

06:41.401 --> 06:45.696
- Thank you.
- Don't take this for anything
other than what it is.

06:45.738 --> 06:47.573
For now, I need you alive.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.926
Did you send Kezzun
to kill the Queen?

07:06.968 --> 07:09.804
- No.
- He tried to murder her
an hour ago

07:09.846 --> 07:10.763
and you didn't know?

07:12.432 --> 07:14.809
Get control of your people,
Yobahn.

07:14.851 --> 07:18.396
- And I want Kezzun locked up!
- For what?

07:18.438 --> 07:22.150
- Being a bit overzealous?
- Overzealous?

07:22.191 --> 07:25.069
Yavalla made herself clear.
The Queen is to remain alive.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.988
Yavalla isn't here.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.073
She might never be,

07:29.115 --> 07:31.659
thanks to your
human-loving friend.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.954
Yeah, you have that kinj.

07:34.996 --> 07:38.040
Won't be much good
against all the Blackfist

07:38.082 --> 07:40.751
and our seven Lu-Qiri.

07:40.793 --> 07:42.837
What does your side have?

07:42.879 --> 07:44.172
We're on the same side,
Yobahn.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.048
For now.

07:46.090 --> 07:48.718
If Yavalla doesn't
get here soon...

07:48.759 --> 07:51.179
the Blackfist
are growing restless.

07:51.220 --> 07:54.182
- I'm trying to convince Talon.
- Don't convince her.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.642
Force her!
Start torturing her friends.

07:56.684 --> 08:00.229
No! I won't do it that way.

08:02.231 --> 08:07.862
Your infatuation with
that girl is making you weak.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.534
( Lu-Qiri roaring )

08:16.245 --> 08:18.873
Convince her soon,

08:18.915 --> 08:22.627
or we'll start
doing things my way, cousin.

08:37.517 --> 08:41.229
- Is Gwynn all right?
- For now.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.605
If you hadn't brought
the Blackfist over,

08:42.647 --> 08:43.898
you wouldn't be having
these problems.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.483
I had no choice.

08:45.525 --> 08:47.318
I had to maintain the balance
between the Blackfist

08:47.360 --> 08:49.904
and the Blackbloods
on both sides of the portal.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.906
This is what Yavalla wants.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.824
If you'd open the portal
and bring her through,
you'd understand.

08:53.866 --> 08:55.826
And she's the only person
who can control the Blackfist.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.328
If she's so important,
why didn't you

08:57.370 --> 08:59.038
bring her through
with the rest of them?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.706
I was about to,
but you closed the portal
before I could.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.250
She should have been
one of the first.

09:02.291 --> 09:06.504
You needed warriors, Talon.
Yavalla is anything but.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.673
She's the last remaining
Blackblood prophetess,

09:08.714 --> 09:09.966
the only keeper
of the old ways.

09:10.007 --> 09:12.218
Zed, I'm on your side,

09:12.260 --> 09:13.344
but I'm not going to
bring through someone

09:13.386 --> 09:15.137
I have no reason to trust.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.480
We have company.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.736
Send her away.

09:30.778 --> 09:33.114
I heard what happened.
Are you all right?

09:33.155 --> 09:35.283
Clearly you don't care

09:35.324 --> 09:37.952
or you might have come
to visit me before today.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.746
- I'm sorry.
- I understand.

09:40.788 --> 09:41.789
You're with your people now.

09:46.210 --> 09:49.171
I'm still on your side.

09:49.213 --> 09:51.716
Yes. That's apparent.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.179
I can serve you better
by serving them.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.557
( scoffs )
And what does that even mean?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.643
It means I need
to work from the inside
to keep Zed in power.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.395
If I don't,
the Blackfist will kill you

10:04.437 --> 10:06.897
and keep your people digging
until you die.

10:06.939 --> 10:09.942
Why are you waiting till now
to tell me this?

10:12.820 --> 10:14.196
Because when I heard
they almost killed you,

10:14.238 --> 10:15.698
I couldn't bear
the thought of you dying

10:15.740 --> 10:17.366
thinking I was a traitor.

10:21.704 --> 10:25.207
If they find out,
they'll kill me,

10:25.249 --> 10:27.710
and then none of you
stand a chance.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.974
Mum loved the pine sap ale.

10:42.016 --> 10:44.644
She wouldn't let me
have any 'cause she said...

10:46.228 --> 10:48.064
...it would be wasted on me.

10:48.105 --> 10:50.149
Big warthog, come here.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.026
I know you, big ogre.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.820
I miss her, too. Hey.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.530
You can have all
the pine sap you want.

10:56.572 --> 10:59.450
Oh, Janzo.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.828
( grunts )

11:02.870 --> 11:04.789
Whew. She wouldn't like that.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.677
Get out.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.264
- Excuse me?
- Get out.

11:22.306 --> 11:24.850
I'm requisitioning
this facility for official use.

11:24.892 --> 11:27.853
- And what's that
supposed to mean?
- Requisition?

11:27.895 --> 11:29.480
It's a verb.
To take or acquire--

11:29.522 --> 11:31.982
I know what requisition means.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.776
This is my lab.
Nobody's taking it.

11:33.818 --> 11:36.195
If I call a Lu-Qiri down here,
it will make an awful mess.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.280
No!

11:38.322 --> 11:41.075
- Don't be so dramatic.
- ( clattering )

11:41.117 --> 11:43.202
This is my brewery.
There'll be no violence.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.330
You'll go peacefully then?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.416
As soon as you tell me
why you want to open that box.

11:48.457 --> 11:51.085
- Box?
- Box, noun,
six-sided container--

11:51.127 --> 11:53.087
- Very funny.
- Let's start off by saying

11:53.129 --> 11:54.922
that box is no ordinary box,
is it? Hmm?

11:54.964 --> 11:56.882
No, that--
that is a meld box,

11:56.924 --> 11:58.592
and those three
funnel holes in the lid

11:58.634 --> 12:00.302
are receptacles
for reactive compounds.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.596
An ancient alchemists'
lock box that only opens

12:02.638 --> 12:04.223
when the correct components
are poured into it.

12:04.265 --> 12:07.893
- Hmm. Smarter than you look.
- Thank you.

12:07.935 --> 12:11.272
Just stay out of my business
and get out of my lab.

12:11.313 --> 12:13.023
Excuse-- excuse-- excuse me?

12:13.065 --> 12:15.443
I live here.
Where am I supposed
to sleep, hmm?

12:15.484 --> 12:18.529
Not my problem.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.656
- This woman.
- Excuse me.

12:23.284 --> 12:26.287
This woman. This woman!

12:38.299 --> 12:39.925
( gargling )

12:39.967 --> 12:41.093
( coughs, belches )

12:53.105 --> 12:55.566
Just who does
she think she is, huh?

12:55.608 --> 12:58.569
She's a bully, that's who.
A nasty little harpy.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.573
- Who is?
- The Blackblood that just
hijacked my brewery.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.742
I'm moving in with you.

13:04.784 --> 13:06.368
Thought you weren't even
talking to me.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.329
Well, I'm not,
but I've got nowhere else
to live, do I?

13:08.370 --> 13:10.915
Besides, I'd much rather you be
my Blackblood guard than him.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.666
It's the least you can do.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.547
I'll take responsibility
for him.

13:22.635 --> 13:23.928
I'm still very angry with you.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.973
Can't say I blame you.

13:28.015 --> 13:29.725
I thought I knew you, Talon.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.312
You know me better
than you think.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.397
Then explain it to me.

13:35.439 --> 13:37.066
Explain why you turned traitor.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.944
I wish I could, Janzo.

13:39.985 --> 13:42.696
For now, the less you know,
the safer you are.

13:44.448 --> 13:45.908
Make yourself at home.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.016
What's this about, Yobahn?

14:11.058 --> 14:13.936
Time for leadership
to pass to the Blackfist.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.021
Yavalla gave that task to me.

14:16.063 --> 14:19.942
And she would take it from you
if she saw your incompetence.

14:19.984 --> 14:21.735
You don't want to do this,
Yobahn.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.199
That thing can
only control one of us.

14:27.241 --> 14:31.704
Pick one.
The rest of us will kill you.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.000
( grunting )

14:37.585 --> 14:39.169
( yelling )

14:51.140 --> 14:52.850
( laughing )

14:52.892 --> 14:54.476
Human lover!

14:54.518 --> 14:56.770
You are as good as the one
who cut off her ears.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.507
Didn't know you still cared.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.443
Do it!

15:54.578 --> 15:56.997
Blackbloods don't kill
Blackbloods, right?

16:00.542 --> 16:02.378
I should kill you.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.214
But it's not
what Yavalla would want.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.759
I'm still in charge, Yobahn.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.572
You should have killed him.
He'll just try again.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.574
Probably,
but I promised Yavalla.

16:32.616 --> 16:34.868
Why does that matter?
What does this woman
have on you?

16:34.910 --> 16:38.163
Nothing. She's the last
Blackblood priestess, Talon.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.957
Don't you understand
what that means?

16:39.999 --> 16:42.167
She's the last of our kind.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.544
I believe in her teachings
of peace and harmony

16:43.585 --> 16:46.171
for everyone,
Blackbloods and humans.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.173
If you'd just bring her
through, you'd see.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.592
You haven't even told me
everything she wants.

16:50.634 --> 16:53.137
- Like what?
- Like what she has you
digging for.

16:53.178 --> 16:57.182
- It's just some crystal
for Wren.
- Yes, I know.

16:57.224 --> 17:01.395
- But what's it do?
- That's all I know.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.148
Do you have any idea
what this Yavalla wants
to do once she gets here?

17:06.066 --> 17:08.861
- No.
- That's why I won't
bring her through.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.584
This is insane.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.411
( coughing )

18:02.623 --> 18:04.416
Janzo:
I miss her too, big guy.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.671
And you. Here, come on.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.423
All right, Janzo. All right.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.478
( coughing )

18:26.313 --> 18:28.690
Trying to find my lichen spore,
if I'm not mistaken?

18:28.732 --> 18:32.069
You keep rustbeetle venom
in a random, unmarked bottle?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.279
Excuse you,
but there's nothing
random about it.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.698
My classification system
is really quite meticulous,
I assure you.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.909
Oh, really?
And how is it sorted?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.703
Because it's not by color
or texture or alphabetically.

18:41.745 --> 18:44.081
- Chronologically.
- Chronologically how?

18:44.123 --> 18:46.500
- In the order
I first smelled them.
- Oh, you're a madman.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.294
And also, chemosensory memory
is really quite powerful.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.296
Just think back to the first
time you ever smelled, hmm,

18:51.338 --> 18:53.715
ninny blossom or bat guano.

18:53.757 --> 18:56.093
- You're a madman.
- And also, it also keeps snoops

18:56.135 --> 18:57.928
from invading
my private laboratory.

18:57.970 --> 19:00.097
I will break
that fancy nose of yours,

19:00.139 --> 19:02.307
and then we'll see about
your chemosensory memory.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.892
Oh, you think my nose
is fancy, do you?

19:03.934 --> 19:06.103
- ( grunting )
- Hey!

19:06.145 --> 19:07.396
The paralysis will wear off
in a few moments.

19:07.437 --> 19:09.064
Yes. Do you not think
I know that?

19:09.106 --> 19:10.357
It seems to me
like you know very little

19:10.399 --> 19:11.525
given that you almost
just killed yourself

19:11.567 --> 19:13.110
using my rustbeetle venom.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.737
Well, maybe if it was labeled
as such, I might not have.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.243
( grunts )

19:22.578 --> 19:24.079
Good luck trying
to find my lichen spore.

19:24.121 --> 19:26.665
I don't need
your lichen spore.
I'll make my own.

19:26.707 --> 19:28.333
Make lichen spore?
That's impossible.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.044
- Is it?
- Mm.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.004
Watch me.

19:41.388 --> 19:42.848
- ( screams )
- ( thudding )

19:42.890 --> 19:44.349
- It's not safe down there.
- ( clattering )

19:44.391 --> 19:48.145
The fumes haven't
dissipated yet.

19:48.187 --> 19:52.691
Why am I always surrounded
by such idiots?

20:26.433 --> 20:27.559
Hey!

21:16.483 --> 21:18.485
I think we found it.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.199
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.271
It's abracite, all right.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.481
Yobahn, you've done
a miraculous thing.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.691
I mean, this stuff is so rare,

21:57.733 --> 21:59.609
like one crystal
in a mountain of rock,

21:59.651 --> 22:00.569
and you found it.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.114
Oh!

22:04.156 --> 22:05.615
Yavalla will be
quite pleased.

22:05.657 --> 22:08.285
I'm glad I could be of service.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.124
Please be sure to tell
your mother Yavalla.

22:14.166 --> 22:16.084
Yes, yes. I will, I will.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.472
( man coughing )

22:29.765 --> 22:32.517
You all right, Sammy?

22:32.559 --> 22:34.936
Better,
thanks to Captain Calkussar

22:34.978 --> 22:37.939
convincing them
to give me the day to heal.

22:37.981 --> 22:40.275
Zed understands you're more
valuable alive than dead.

22:40.317 --> 22:42.486
- ( door closes )
- They're gone.

22:42.527 --> 22:45.322
Gentlemen,
I think I've figured out

22:45.364 --> 22:46.573
how to get Rosmund
out of the Outpost.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.702
I spent the whole day
listening to the guards.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.538
Seems like the gate's
gonna be open tonight
just before midnight.

22:53.580 --> 22:56.166
They're all excited
for a shipment of food
they raided from a village,

22:56.208 --> 22:58.543
- including a herd of sheep.
- So what?

22:58.585 --> 23:01.129
There's always two Lu-Qiri
guarding the gates
at one time, day and night.

23:01.171 --> 23:03.965
Well, here's
the interesting part.

23:04.007 --> 23:05.300
The Lu-Qiri will be
moved off the front gate

23:05.342 --> 23:07.219
or else they can't
drive the sheep in.

23:07.260 --> 23:09.346
Too skittish to be near
a predator like that.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.723
So an open gate,
a couple Blackblood guards,

23:11.765 --> 23:15.852
- and a bit of commotion.
- Yeah.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.979
- Has to be tonight, then.
- Sammy, I admit I never

23:18.021 --> 23:19.981
really forgave you
for pretending to be Alton,

23:20.023 --> 23:23.360
but you've just
redeemed yourself a little.

23:23.402 --> 23:25.028
Maybe this will redeem me more.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.371
I finished the tunnel.

23:37.833 --> 23:41.378
- One kick, it's open.
- Sammy, I could kiss you!

23:41.420 --> 23:43.004
That's all right.
You're not my type.

23:43.046 --> 23:45.882
Tonight then,
we rescue the Queen.

23:45.924 --> 23:46.967
Yeah.

24:39.686 --> 24:40.979
( grunts )

25:18.475 --> 25:19.476
Tobin.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.104
How did you get in here?

25:23.146 --> 25:25.899
We've come to break you out.

25:25.941 --> 25:28.652
Oh. Garret.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.403
- Your Majesty.
- Hello.

25:40.413 --> 25:41.456
Around your waist.

25:42.832 --> 25:43.875
Your hands.

25:48.296 --> 25:50.840
We have to hurry.
Come on, let's go.

26:10.986 --> 26:12.320
( clears throat )

26:38.805 --> 26:40.223
Just like Sammy said.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.623
- ( growling )
- ( screaming )

27:04.664 --> 27:06.666
Tobin! Tobin!

27:14.424 --> 27:15.342
( gasping )

27:39.991 --> 27:42.619
These three were caught
in the act of escape.

27:44.287 --> 27:46.665
This is open rebellion.

27:46.706 --> 27:51.169
They must be
executed immediately by
your own decree, Zed.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.880
We'll give them a trial.

27:53.922 --> 27:58.259
The evidence is undisputed.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.137
- They won't deny it.
- Were you trying to escape?

28:03.431 --> 28:06.476
- What choice did I have?
- A confession.

28:06.518 --> 28:09.104
They must die at once.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.274
Starting with the Queen.

28:13.316 --> 28:14.401
- No.
- Hey.

28:14.442 --> 28:15.777
( grunting )

28:15.819 --> 28:17.487
Zed, you have to stop him.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.073
Your friends knew what would
happen if they got caught.

28:20.115 --> 28:22.492
Zed, if you kill the Queen,
the humans will revolt.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.911
( Yobahn laughs )

28:27.122 --> 28:30.250
What can they do?
We have them under control.

28:30.291 --> 28:33.795
- They are weak.
- It wasn't Rosmund's idea.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.131
All right? It was mine.

28:36.172 --> 28:38.633
She was just following me.

28:42.303 --> 28:45.974
Very well.
Execute the two men.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.225
The Queen will be spared
for now.

28:51.062 --> 28:53.523
You are still too weak
to do what is necessary.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.692
Don't test me, Yobahn.

28:55.734 --> 28:56.901
I've given you most
of what you want.

28:56.943 --> 28:58.862
Now execute the two men.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.366
By your command.

29:08.705 --> 29:10.373
I'll bring Yavalla through.

29:13.460 --> 29:16.087
I'll bring Yavalla to
this world if you spare them.

29:20.133 --> 29:22.761
- Yobahn?
- Do it now.

29:41.237 --> 29:44.324
( speaking Blackblood )

30:40.463 --> 30:41.381
Zed.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.594
What exactly has been
going on here?

30:50.515 --> 30:51.516
Your Majesty.

30:51.558 --> 30:53.226
My apologies for the way

30:53.268 --> 30:55.144
you have been treated
by these men.

30:55.186 --> 31:00.692
They will be dealt with
appropriately.

31:00.733 --> 31:04.028
I assure you
our true intentions
are peace and unity

31:04.070 --> 31:06.030
for Blackbloods
and humans alike.

31:06.072 --> 31:10.243
- I'm Queen Rosmund.
- Pleased to meet you.

31:10.285 --> 31:13.371
I am Yavalla, prophetess
of the Blackbloods.

31:13.413 --> 31:18.418
- Honored, I hope.
- I assure you,
I have the same hope.

31:20.295 --> 31:22.213
If you mean what
you say about peace,

31:22.255 --> 31:24.257
it must start
by freeing my people

31:24.299 --> 31:26.342
and returning the Outpost
to my control.

31:26.384 --> 31:30.471
The manner in which
Yobahn conducted
the mining operation

31:30.513 --> 31:34.475
was unfortunate.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.227
With my sincere apologies,

31:36.269 --> 31:38.521
I release your people
from their labors.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.108
And freeing them?

31:42.150 --> 31:44.694
Within these walls,
they are free, yes.

31:44.736 --> 31:48.907
However, I cannot allow them
to leave the Outpost just yet.

31:48.948 --> 31:50.491
Given the hostilities
between our people,

31:50.533 --> 31:54.329
you understand I cannot risk
reprisals from outsiders.

31:54.370 --> 31:58.082
Mm. And what of me?

31:58.124 --> 32:02.629
You are to remain our guest,
extended every kindness.

32:02.670 --> 32:06.215
We are to be friends,
not enemies.

32:32.158 --> 32:34.744
- It's not going to work.
- Why are you even here?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.579
Your mother said
that we're allowed
to go wherever we want.

32:36.621 --> 32:38.164
Oh, not here.

32:40.375 --> 32:42.919
You can't just grow
lichen spore from a bowl

32:42.961 --> 32:45.546
made from cave mold
and flyweed.

32:45.588 --> 32:47.382
What else do you have there?
Some common acids.

32:47.423 --> 32:49.759
Obviously coming from
the Plane of Ashes,

32:49.801 --> 32:51.219
you're at a major disadvantage,
aren't you?

32:51.260 --> 32:54.055
And you've got no access
to alchemy journals

32:54.097 --> 32:57.141
or archives to tell you
standard methodology.

32:57.183 --> 33:00.478
Well, access to ingredients,
that must be impoverished
to say the le--

33:00.520 --> 33:02.814
Do you ever shut up?

33:04.315 --> 33:05.775
Only when I don't
have anything to say.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.943
And right now
I have quite a lot to say

33:06.985 --> 33:09.404
- because what you're--
- Shut up!

33:19.998 --> 33:20.915
Uh-huh.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.377
Impossible.

33:24.419 --> 33:26.796
Just the right amount
of heat and acid causes
a stress reaction

33:26.838 --> 33:28.756
in common cave mold,
forcing it to release--

33:28.798 --> 33:30.717
- Lichen spore.
- In small quantities, yes.

33:30.758 --> 33:33.261
But by the time the sun rises,
I'll have enough.

33:39.225 --> 33:41.310
Don't bother wasting
your time.

33:41.352 --> 33:44.272
There's enough lichen spore
in there for whatever you need.

33:44.313 --> 33:46.399
Why would you want
to help me?

33:46.441 --> 33:48.359
Well, I don't
want you to use up
all my flyweed, do I?

33:51.446 --> 33:52.447
Thank you.

33:58.661 --> 33:59.579
No.

34:07.879 --> 34:11.007
Why did you save me
when you've obviously

34:11.049 --> 34:13.801
taken their side
against humans?

34:16.471 --> 34:20.016
I thought you of all people
would understand
what I've been doing.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.226
I'm clearly not as clever
as you thought,

34:22.268 --> 34:24.479
so why don't you
explain it to me?

34:24.520 --> 34:27.440
I mean,
you've seen it yourself.

34:27.482 --> 34:31.861
Zed is the only thing
keeping the Blackfist
from killing Gwynn.

34:31.903 --> 34:34.739
- Kezzun already tried once.
- Wait, what?

34:36.157 --> 34:38.409
Kezzun snuck into
Gwynn's quarters,

34:38.451 --> 34:39.410
tried to kill her.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.790
Luckily,
Zed was there to stop him.

34:43.831 --> 34:46.250
This time maybe, but, ah--

34:46.292 --> 34:48.836
but what if he tries again?

34:48.878 --> 34:52.340
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

34:52.381 --> 34:55.259
The only way
I can keep Gwynn alive
is to keep Zed in power.

34:55.301 --> 34:59.972
Even if it means the rest of us
are shackled and beaten?

35:00.014 --> 35:02.350
I tried everything I could
to stop that.

35:02.391 --> 35:06.229
Well, forgive me
if it didn't look like it
from down in the pit.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.481
Do you have any idea
what I've had to do

35:08.523 --> 35:11.067
to keep Zed believing
I was on his side?

35:13.319 --> 35:15.488
Do you think I like watching
my friends get beaten

35:15.530 --> 35:18.282
and worked to exhaustion?

35:18.324 --> 35:21.536
For you all to think
I'm a traitor? To hate me?

35:24.330 --> 35:27.291
I did what I had to
to keep Gwynn safe.

35:28.459 --> 35:31.921
Suppose I believe you.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.507
That would mean
you took an awful risk

35:34.549 --> 35:37.510
saving Tobin and me.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.304
I couldn't let you die,
Garret.

35:40.346 --> 35:43.516
You should hate me, Talon,

35:43.558 --> 35:47.311
after all we've been through.

35:47.353 --> 35:49.230
I've tried to hate you,
Garret.

35:52.567 --> 35:54.861
I'm just not very good at it.

36:32.023 --> 36:33.024
I'll let you rest up.

36:52.627 --> 36:53.961
Good morning.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.758
And what do you want?

36:58.799 --> 37:02.386
I want to get to know
the One.

37:02.428 --> 37:04.013
Now that
the prophecy's fulfilled,

37:04.055 --> 37:07.016
- I'm just plain old Talon.
- But it is not fulfilled.

37:07.058 --> 37:11.187
Do you really think
the Prime Order are
the oppressors of old?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.814
Do you think the prophecy
was simply about liberating

37:13.856 --> 37:18.194
some humans
from some other humans?

37:18.236 --> 37:19.570
I try not to overthink it.

37:21.447 --> 37:23.032
Can I ask you a question?

37:23.074 --> 37:26.202
Why am I here?
What am I after?

37:26.244 --> 37:29.372
Yes. Zed won't tell me.

37:29.413 --> 37:32.208
Zed's mission
was to bring me here.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.044
He does not know why.

37:35.086 --> 37:36.796
And now that you're here?

37:38.673 --> 37:41.342
I am happy to share all.
I have nothing to hide.

37:45.388 --> 37:48.516
You have seen
the Plane of Ashes, yes?

37:48.557 --> 37:50.226
Yes.

37:50.268 --> 37:54.438
- It's an awful place.
- Yes. Yes, it is.

37:54.480 --> 37:56.482
But there is another world,

37:56.524 --> 37:58.734
opposite to
the Plane of Ashes
in every way.

37:58.776 --> 38:02.446
A fertile paradise where
the Blackbloods can unite

38:02.488 --> 38:06.075
as one people again
and live in peace.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.953
It's a nice dream,
but hard to believe.

38:11.372 --> 38:16.252
Why do you think this Outpost
is so vital to the Blackbloods?

38:16.294 --> 38:19.463
The power to open the way
to paradise is here

38:19.505 --> 38:21.299
somewhere at the Outpost.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.428
- A kinj.
- What other true power
is there?

38:25.469 --> 38:28.472
And when we find it,
the Blackbloods will unite

38:28.514 --> 38:30.891
and rebuild
our once great nation.

38:30.933 --> 38:34.729
The suffering of our people
will at last be over.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.815
You're talking to
the wrong person about this.

38:39.233 --> 38:41.861
You need to be talking
to Queen Rosmund.

38:48.326 --> 38:49.952
Gods, it's good to be
back in here again.

38:49.994 --> 38:51.829
Ah. Thank you, Janzo.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.664
Cheers, Janzy.

38:53.706 --> 38:54.874
Yes.

38:57.960 --> 39:00.504
Make no mistake,
we're still prisoners.

39:00.546 --> 39:04.967
And Gwynn is still locked up,
and one of those bastards
already tried to kill her once.

39:05.009 --> 39:07.845
So who knows what that
Blackblood priestess is up to?

39:07.887 --> 39:09.930
She released us from digging.

39:09.972 --> 39:11.807
You have to admit,
that's something.

39:11.849 --> 39:14.143
Yeah, once she got
what she wanted.

39:14.185 --> 39:18.147
Until she frees us completely,
it's not much.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.150
Jualita? Have they allowed you
to attend to Queen Rosmund?

39:21.192 --> 39:22.943
No. They still
won't let me see her.

39:22.985 --> 39:25.654
But I was happy to see
they've changed her guards.

39:25.696 --> 39:28.532
The one who attacked her
isn't allowed in
the building anymore.

39:43.005 --> 39:44.298
I'm going to get
something stronger.

39:50.554 --> 39:52.348
Hey, Jualita.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.975
They posted that Blackfist
Kezzun somewhere else?

39:55.017 --> 39:56.519
East gate, if I heard right.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.777
The gateway
to a paradise world?

40:04.819 --> 40:07.738
Forgive my skepticism,
but that sounds like
a children's fable.

40:10.282 --> 40:13.994
Does the Plane of Ashes also
sound like a fable to you?

40:14.036 --> 40:17.331
Because as your
friend Talon will attest,
it is all quite real.

40:19.417 --> 40:24.380
Where exactly is this kinj
that will transport us
to a new world?

40:24.422 --> 40:27.800
This Outpost was built over
an old Blackblood citadel.

40:27.842 --> 40:31.220
The entrance is hidden,
but we will find it.

40:31.262 --> 40:34.056
My daughter Wren
is working on it
even as we speak.

40:36.809 --> 40:41.230
And when you find this kinj,
you'll free our people for good?

40:41.272 --> 40:43.023
You have my word.

40:43.065 --> 40:44.400
All of your people
will be free.

40:44.442 --> 40:47.820
But I need your word
that there will be

40:47.862 --> 40:50.614
no more trouble
from your people.

40:50.656 --> 40:53.367
It there's no trouble
from yours.

40:53.409 --> 40:56.412
You have my word.

40:56.454 --> 40:58.497
My people will remain peaceful.

41:08.924 --> 41:10.050
( inhales )

41:10.092 --> 41:11.594
( metal scraping )

41:17.975 --> 41:19.185
( inhales )

41:19.226 --> 41:20.478
( metal clanging )

41:41.749 --> 41:44.043
( grunting )

41:45.127 --> 41:46.712
For the Queen.
