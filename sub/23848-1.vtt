00:15.880 --> 00:17.840
Breathe very calmly.

00:19.520 --> 00:23.680
Breathe in... and out.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.640
Don't try to put your thoughts into order.

00:28.240 --> 00:30.240
Just let them go.

00:31.080 --> 00:35.800
And breathe in very deeply...

00:37.240 --> 00:38.640
and out.

00:39.640 --> 00:43.160
And when I say "now"
you will open your eyes.

00:44.280 --> 00:45.240
Now.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.160
Yes, close your eyes again.

00:57.160 --> 00:59.760
Good. Good.

01:01.640 --> 01:06.040
And now delve twice as deeply
into your relaxed state than before.

01:06.760 --> 01:08.000
Take your time.

01:12.960 --> 01:14.640
I will now take you back...

01:15.680 --> 01:16.640
to the source.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.600
To the source of your fear.

01:23.440 --> 01:26.000
I... will guide you...

01:27.880 --> 01:30.360
step by step.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.480
Step by step...

01:36.080 --> 01:38.000
all the way to the source of your fear.

01:39.040 --> 01:40.560
To the truth.

01:48.880 --> 01:50.280
You are in Cologne.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.560
In your hometown.

01:56.560 --> 01:59.560
It is the summer
shortly before you are drafted.

02:07.520 --> 02:09.120
There is your father.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.600
You long for the war so much,

02:14.680 --> 02:18.080
you're dying to finally go away
and leave everything behind you.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.680
There is the woman you love.

02:27.600 --> 02:30.360
But something keeps you apart from her.

03:33.320 --> 03:37.320
NOVORZHEV, SOVIET UNION
1496 KM TO BERLIN

03:59.640 --> 04:02.800
To the right.
Come on! Come on, move!

04:07.800 --> 04:09.400
What do they want?

04:11.400 --> 04:12.960
-Clothes.
-Don't hurt us.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.320
Don't worry. Your clothes.
Uniform. Then no harm.

04:24.360 --> 04:26.720
-We do nothing. Just clothes.
-On your knees!

06:12.680 --> 06:15.880
NEUKÖLLN, BERLIN
APRIL 29, 1929. 5:53 A.M.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.120
You got the runs or something?

07:09.120 --> 07:10.200
It's packed in there.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.480
Go on, open it.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.200
Maria, you come out of the stable

07:23.280 --> 07:27.680
and look at the lights of Bethlehem
with chaste eyes. Where the bird is.

07:27.760 --> 07:30.560
And now Archangel Gabriel, please.

07:32.320 --> 07:35.920
Maria, turn around now,
I can't see anything.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.720
More this way.

07:38.440 --> 07:41.400
Frieda, you're receiving the Redeemer,
I can't see that.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.560
Give it some more. Paul, faster.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.120
Turn around some more,
I can't see anything.

07:59.760 --> 08:00.920
Vice squad.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.880
This is a raid! Show is over.

08:05.160 --> 08:08.360
Ladies and gentlemen, form an orderly row,

08:08.440 --> 08:11.440
pack away your genitals
and keep your mouths shut.

08:16.080 --> 08:17.080
We have to take all this.

08:17.840 --> 08:21.000
Every photo, film, can, everything.

08:21.400 --> 08:23.680
You're in charge.
We mustn't lose any detail.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.440
You with the trumpet, stand here.
On the double.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.600
You two, pack everything into the car.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.920
-And who are you?
-The carpenter.

08:32.000 --> 08:34.920
-Who's that supposed to be?
-Jesus' father, of course.

08:35.560 --> 08:38.000
Look, God's also in it.

08:38.080 --> 08:42.880
And the Virgin Mary, the boy
with the curly hair, everyone's here.

08:43.520 --> 08:44.440
Mr. König.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.560
Paragraph 118. Art is free.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.400
You will have to prove I'm not an artist.

08:51.480 --> 08:52.640
A rat is what you are.

08:53.440 --> 08:56.280
And you're a bluebottle.
Can't ever get rid of you, huh?

08:56.360 --> 08:57.680
Too much shit stuck on you.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.120
No offense,
but we can't let him get away with that.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.640
We're not done here.

09:45.280 --> 09:48.320
Won't be long, they're almost done
with the holy couple. Look, sweetie.

09:53.280 --> 09:54.200
Closing time.

09:56.280 --> 09:57.520
I know you.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.120
Get them all out of there.

10:51.920 --> 10:52.840
Come on out.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.240
You'll shoot me up here

11:04.840 --> 11:06.520
and let my colleague downstairs get you?

11:07.040 --> 11:10.120
-The fat guy won't get me.
-Sure he will. He's got a gun.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.880
-A bigger one than that toy of yours.
-Toy?

11:30.680 --> 11:31.520
Thanks.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.960
Maybe you do things differently
in Cologne,

11:37.040 --> 11:41.160
but here in the capital it's a good idea
to draw your weapon first.

11:44.200 --> 11:47.120
Yes, I'm afraid
it fell down the shaft back there.

11:49.440 --> 11:51.160
I'll let Willi know,
you'll have it back tomorrow.

11:55.360 --> 11:58.600
Right, you nitwit. Say thank you.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.080
-What?
-I can't hear you.

12:04.680 --> 12:05.520
Thank you.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.160
And do you know what for?

12:09.800 --> 12:14.600
I just saved your arse
from being tried as a cop killer.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.680
You've still got the attempted cop murder
going for you,

12:18.400 --> 12:20.680
apart from the filth
with those little boys.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.120
-But I didn't do...
-You speak when I ask you a question.

12:25.640 --> 12:26.480
But...

12:28.240 --> 12:31.160
Maybe this bullet was never fired.

12:32.000 --> 12:35.440
And somehow you got away up here.

12:36.200 --> 12:38.000
You know what I mean, right?

12:39.440 --> 12:40.280
Right.

12:41.480 --> 12:45.080
And now introduce yourself
to my colleague from Cologne. Name?

12:45.800 --> 12:47.600
-Krajewski.
-Beg your pardon?

12:47.680 --> 12:50.960
-Krajewski, Franz.
-Rank and regiment?

12:51.280 --> 12:52.960
Private, infantry,

12:53.040 --> 12:54.600
second Hanseatic, w...

12:54.680 --> 12:56.840
-Pardon?
-West front.

12:56.920 --> 12:57.880
Residence?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.680
In the ruins on Hermannplatz. I see. I get it.

13:03.960 --> 13:07.000
Now listen. Erwin in the kiosk...

13:07.720 --> 13:10.080
at the underground station. He's our guy.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.720
You'll report to him at 12 sharp.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.960
And when we ask you a question then,
you'll have the answer.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.080
Come on, you trembler.

13:21.160 --> 13:22.560
Pull yourself together.

14:20.000 --> 14:20.840
Where's Lotte?

14:44.680 --> 14:45.640
Lotte? Where have you been?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.640
Everywhere.

14:56.120 --> 14:57.280
Haven't you slept at all?

14:59.040 --> 15:01.400
-No.
-And right off to work?

15:02.280 --> 15:03.600
I don't know how you do it.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.800
But you know the deal.
If you sleep you miss being awake.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.320
And I have to be on watch.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.720
What about here?

15:15.920 --> 15:17.000
Paradise.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.400
Leopold?

15:36.680 --> 15:40.600
<i>Your eyes are magnets</i>

15:41.240 --> 15:45.320
<i>And they beam like the stars</i>

15:45.840 --> 15:47.600
Your kisses

15:47.680 --> 15:49.920
Connecting wires

15:50.000 --> 15:54.680
Between Earth and Heaven

15:54.880 --> 15:56.960
A little technique A little love

15:59.240 --> 16:03.640
A little bliss and a little pain

16:03.960 --> 16:08.200
They are the engine of the machine

16:08.640 --> 16:11.880
And busy is the stupid heart

16:12.240 --> 16:14.720
-Left pocket.
-Did you bring something?

16:18.440 --> 16:19.400
Yellow.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.200
I haven't got that one yet.

16:24.840 --> 16:25.840
What's this?

16:30.160 --> 16:31.720
Nothing. Just a bruise.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.240
Can you bring me my stockings?
The fine ones, please.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.440
It's no big deal, Toni.

16:46.520 --> 16:49.520
What's with that bloody noise?
And where is the rent?

16:49.880 --> 16:52.400
-On the table.
-No. Half is missing.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.080
I'll have it tonight.

16:54.160 --> 16:55.560
Hey, watch it!

16:56.560 --> 16:58.480
Who can piss with a hard-on?

17:00.720 --> 17:03.120
-Why don't you touch it?
-You pig.

17:09.320 --> 17:10.160
Lotte!

17:12.320 --> 17:16.880
Lotte!
We need 20. Schröder will kick us out.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.600
Tonight, I promise.

17:21.840 --> 17:22.680
Lotte?

18:09.720 --> 18:14.240
Here, a little souvenir
of your exciting time in the capital.

18:17.080 --> 18:19.880
-Where do you know that guy from?
-Krajewski?

18:21.240 --> 18:23.560
Believe it or not,
he used to be one of us.

18:24.200 --> 18:25.400
A police officer.

18:26.120 --> 18:29.680
He honestly thought he could just go back
to working after the war.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.000
A trembler.

18:32.640 --> 18:36.240
One day, he's at an operation.
There's a huge shoot-out...

18:36.680 --> 18:39.120
and that chicken
can't get a grip on himself.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.360
They kicked him out.

18:44.840 --> 18:45.800
No honors for him.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.320
Get out of my way, you ninny!

19:12.640 --> 19:13.480
Don't.

19:21.080 --> 19:21.960
Stop it.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.480
I'm going to the police, no lie.
Wanna come?

19:36.360 --> 19:39.960
At the front,
those chickens folded in droves.

19:40.040 --> 19:43.720
Now you just have to breathe on them
and the waterworks open.

19:44.960 --> 19:46.600
I was in Belgium.

19:47.840 --> 19:49.120
And France.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.240
What about you?

19:53.200 --> 19:56.680
Only the final game. The Siegfried Line.

19:58.200 --> 20:00.320
They're broken automatons...

20:01.160 --> 20:02.480
no more.

20:03.200 --> 20:05.760
And broken automatons
belong on the landfill.

20:08.440 --> 20:09.360
Apparently.

20:22.280 --> 20:26.080
POLICE HEADQUARTERS "RED CASTLE",
ALEXANDERPLATZ, MITTE, BERLIN

20:28.240 --> 20:29.760
-Morning.
-Excuse me.

20:39.720 --> 20:43.640
-Excuse me, we're waiting too.
-I've been waiting for an hour, too.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.040
-Chewing gum?
-I'll take it. Thanks.

20:47.400 --> 20:50.360
-Has old Reckwitz been here?
-Good morning, Councillor.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.680
Once. Not much going today. -Hello.
-Hi.

20:59.560 --> 21:01.000
-Morning, Jänicke.
-Good morning, Mr. Gräf.

21:01.080 --> 21:02.240
What a load.

21:03.360 --> 21:06.280
-Morning, girls.
-Good morning, Inspector.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.240
-Who's the dressy guy?
-There she is.

21:14.080 --> 21:15.960
-Morning, ladies.
-Good morning.

21:16.040 --> 21:18.320
So, we need 12 transcripts...

21:18.400 --> 21:19.600
I'll do it!

21:20.920 --> 21:24.120
37 notices of annulment for B.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.000
Thank you.

21:26.080 --> 21:28.960
-90 citations for H.
-Here.

21:29.040 --> 21:32.160
-And then we need someone who knows...
-Me.

21:33.320 --> 21:34.280
French?

21:35.560 --> 21:37.480
-Miss Amelie, of course.
-Thanks.

21:38.080 --> 21:39.880
Right, ladies, that's it for now.

21:41.320 --> 21:44.240
You're very welcome to wait
but I doubt there'll be much more today.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.400
See you tomorrow.

21:50.600 --> 21:53.080
Yes, there is something else.

21:53.640 --> 21:56.720
Cataloguing the photography archive
of the homicide squad.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.800
Here!

21:57.880 --> 22:00.440
-I'd like the lady with the green hat.
-You.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.120
Thank you. Miss Ritter?

22:07.280 --> 22:08.120
Right?

22:09.400 --> 22:10.640
-The Buddha wants...
-Who?

22:10.720 --> 22:12.440
Gennat, the chief of the homicide squad.

22:12.960 --> 22:15.480
Gennat wants to create
a catchword register

22:15.560 --> 22:18.760
with descriptions of all murder cases
of the last 13 years. Like this:

22:18.840 --> 22:20.360
Crime scene, murder weapon,

22:20.440 --> 22:22.840
condition of the body. Everything, really.

22:23.320 --> 22:25.640
-And you want me to...
-You describe what you see,

22:25.720 --> 22:27.920
and in a systematic way.

22:28.760 --> 22:34.120
Take this, for example.
Axe murder, split skull, amputation.

22:34.800 --> 22:38.520
The pictures are organized by case.
On the back are the date and case number.

22:38.960 --> 22:41.200
-Catchword register.
-Correct. Later on, we can look for parallels.

22:43.800 --> 22:46.440
Like if someone uses the same weapon
several times or a perpetrator...

22:46.520 --> 22:48.320
You took all the pictures?

22:49.800 --> 22:51.560
Upstairs there are three times as many.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.800
One mark an hour,
I'll sign off tomorrow morning.

22:54.880 --> 22:55.760
Thanks.

23:04.360 --> 23:08.520
Do you know all the stuff
Inspector Rath has collected about you...

23:09.120 --> 23:13.080
in the last few weeks
since you left Cologne?

23:18.640 --> 23:20.240
Let's talk about him.

23:22.360 --> 23:25.800
Let's hear it. What kind of guy is he?

23:29.640 --> 23:32.880
You want me to tell you
stuff about your colleague?

23:32.960 --> 23:34.840
He knows you, so you know him.

23:36.400 --> 23:37.960
What's in it for me?

23:43.040 --> 23:43.880
For you? A kiss.

23:49.760 --> 23:50.880
Wait...

23:52.920 --> 23:54.160
you've got something there.

24:00.080 --> 24:01.240
Come on, spill.

24:03.840 --> 24:07.840
His father is the right hand of
Cologne's Lord Mayor. High brass police.

24:08.800 --> 24:09.920
I know that, mate.

24:11.440 --> 24:12.800
He's ambitious.

24:13.840 --> 24:14.680
Dogged. A ferret.

24:16.920 --> 24:17.960
I know.

24:18.760 --> 24:21.320
Goes to church, prays, believes in God.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.000
Yes, I know all that.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.800
But what don't I know?

24:28.040 --> 24:31.560
How would I know what you don't know,
Chief Inspector?

24:34.720 --> 24:36.640
Why is he with the vice squad?

24:36.760 --> 24:38.880
-What?
-Why not something decent?

24:38.960 --> 24:40.360
Murder, corruption...

24:41.120 --> 24:42.600
secret police?

24:46.440 --> 24:49.320
-Inspector? The interrogation records.
-Thank you.

24:52.120 --> 24:53.880
-Can I do anything...
-Thanks.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.800
Right, where's Wolter?

25:00.680 --> 25:03.520
-He's interrogating König.
-What?

25:03.720 --> 25:06.720
<i>What... </i>What do you want?

25:07.480 --> 25:09.880
I want to know what's between you two.

25:11.280 --> 25:15.240
And what he wants from you. Don't tell me
he's just here because of your filth.

25:21.960 --> 25:25.000
He's a Catholic.
They don't like this kind of stuff.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.440
Oh man!

25:30.520 --> 25:35.160
You're almost begging to go to prison
as a child shagger tonight.

25:37.480 --> 25:40.800
You have no idea who you're dealing with.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.280
Who are you talking about?

25:46.760 --> 25:48.000
Gereon Rath?

25:55.440 --> 25:57.280
We were just talking about you.

25:57.360 --> 25:58.640
Good thing you're here.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.240
I just wanted to take a quick pee.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.040
I'll deal with this.

26:15.000 --> 26:16.440
You know what I'm looking for.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.240
Where is the film?

26:22.520 --> 26:24.880
Just tell him to pay.

26:25.920 --> 26:28.760
He won't pay. That's why I'm here.

26:30.760 --> 26:32.120
He will pay.

26:36.640 --> 26:37.880
Get the paramedic.

26:38.840 --> 26:39.800
Yes, sir.

26:39.880 --> 26:42.040
And come to me
when he can be interrogated again.

26:54.120 --> 26:58.160
INSTITUTE FOR SUGGESTIVE THERAPY
ADLERSHOF, BERLIN

27:15.040 --> 27:17.720
Franz, how are you?

27:20.000 --> 27:23.120
-Do you want to give us another try?
-Yes, please.

27:23.520 --> 27:24.880
Are you off the drugs?

27:26.000 --> 27:29.400
-No, doctor, but I...
-Those are the rules, Franz.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.960
We got caught this morning.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.000
And?

27:39.560 --> 27:40.760
They've got König.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.120
He didn't destroy the film.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.760
Why not? I explicitly told him to.

27:51.200 --> 27:53.400
He tried to make some money with the film.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.560
On his own account.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.480
That's not good, Franz.

28:16.840 --> 28:21.800
BORDER STATION TAUROGGEN
1046 KM TO BERLIN

28:22.640 --> 28:26.880
FRONTIER OF THE GERMAN REICH

28:28.040 --> 28:29.000
Stop.

28:34.120 --> 28:35.920
What's your freight in there?

28:37.120 --> 28:38.520
All pesticides.

28:38.600 --> 28:40.280
-Documents.
-What?

28:40.680 --> 28:41.920
We must check the freight documents.

28:43.800 --> 28:44.640
Yes.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.120
-He wants to see the freight papers.
-We'll just drive on.

28:50.200 --> 28:53.200
Are you nuts? Calm down. I'll handle this.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.640
-Alright?
-Do it.

29:12.280 --> 29:13.480
The <i>Reichswehr </i>.

29:18.600 --> 29:20.760
What's going on?
Why did you stop the train?

29:20.840 --> 29:22.640
We're doing our checks, Major.

29:22.760 --> 29:26.240
-Let the train through.
-Major, according to our regulations...

29:26.320 --> 29:27.960
The train is running
by order of the <i>Reichswehr </i>.

29:28.040 --> 29:32.400
It says that here, but someone
has to sign off the freight documents.

29:41.200 --> 29:43.440
I need the full name.

29:44.480 --> 29:47.080
That is Major General Seegers.

29:56.280 --> 29:57.600
IMPORT LICENSE GRANTED

30:00.200 --> 30:01.040
Have a safe trip.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.400
Let's go.

30:42.480 --> 30:46.800
<i>Uncle just passed the border.</i>
<i>Gift on its way to Berlin.</i>

31:20.920 --> 31:21.760
Sveta.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.480
It all went well.

31:38.440 --> 31:39.760
You are my hero.

31:43.880 --> 31:44.960
Alexey.

32:26.880 --> 32:29.720
That's untypical. Sandor is never late.

32:38.880 --> 32:39.880
Times change.

32:41.200 --> 32:45.240
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Your brother's reliability has waned.

32:46.640 --> 32:47.680
More precise, please.

32:49.240 --> 32:51.960
You deliver 35,000 bottles of arrack
per year.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.080
I supply the entire city,
you remain silent,

32:55.160 --> 32:57.520
I pay you well, we could all be happy.

32:59.800 --> 33:01.760
-But?
-There have been complaints

33:01.840 --> 33:04.520
about the quality of the alcohol.
More and more often.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.120
Then I had them investigate

33:08.200 --> 33:10.400
and made an interesting discovery.

33:12.200 --> 33:15.000
What is this?
I don't drink arrack with my octopus.

33:29.000 --> 33:29.840
Right?

33:31.400 --> 33:34.560
Your good, thoroughly honest
and very punctual Sandor

33:35.000 --> 33:38.480
simply swapped your fine brew
for cheap booze.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.760
Did he think I wouldn't notice?

33:43.560 --> 33:46.280
Did he think the fine tongues
of our guests would fail?

33:53.280 --> 33:54.960
Even though the tongue
is the most sensitive

33:55.040 --> 33:57.680
and has the best blood supply
of all human sensory organs.

34:01.760 --> 34:03.160
Where is Sandor?

34:06.720 --> 34:08.480
What's with the whimpering?

34:08.840 --> 34:10.920
Mr. Kardakov, please.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.680
One, two, one, two, three.

34:17.600 --> 34:18.440
Thank you.

34:21.520 --> 34:22.600
The tongue...

34:23.160 --> 34:24.440
is unique.

34:24.680 --> 34:28.560
A small miracle of nature.
Which is why it is also a delicacy.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.920
Where is my brother?

34:46.920 --> 34:47.760
Dr. Schmidt is outside.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.400
Enjoy your octopus, Mr. Gosztony.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.040
Doctor.

35:18.400 --> 35:20.800
I don't want to waste your valuable time.

35:20.880 --> 35:23.440
Oh, please. How can I help?

35:24.800 --> 35:29.360
I have been told that our mutual friend
is doing business for his own account.

35:30.160 --> 35:31.080
König?

35:31.840 --> 35:32.840
König.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.720
He put one film aside.

35:36.680 --> 35:39.800
The man is endangering
our entire operation.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.400
I'll deal with it.

35:43.480 --> 35:44.320
Good.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.640
THIRD ACT

36:52.600 --> 36:54.160
Hey, busy bee.

36:54.560 --> 36:56.000
A beer after work?

36:56.760 --> 36:57.760
I've still got work to do.

37:00.440 --> 37:03.080
Suit yourself. See you tomorrow.

37:03.960 --> 37:04.920
Listen, Bruno.

37:09.080 --> 37:10.720
Why did you start without me?

37:12.640 --> 37:14.200
Sometimes that's better.

37:15.200 --> 37:16.640
Tomorrow we'll swap.

37:18.160 --> 37:19.160
Fine with me.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.160
Here's the file. For your interrogation.

38:01.480 --> 38:02.640
Clocking off time.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.680
-I'm sorry.
-I beg your pardon.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.160
I think those are yours.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.200
Yes, thanks.

38:27.320 --> 38:28.160
This must be yours.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.080
-This should be yours.
-Yes, many thanks.

38:40.120 --> 38:41.560
I hope you're with vice.

38:43.080 --> 38:45.000
And I hope you're with the homicide squad.

38:49.760 --> 38:50.720
Goodbye.

39:14.600 --> 39:16.440
EVERYONE ONCE IN BERLIN
THE WORLD CITY OF ORDER AND BEAUTY

39:16.520 --> 39:17.800
Everyone once in Berlin.

39:28.120 --> 39:29.760
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Mr. Rath.

39:32.880 --> 39:34.080
I have mail for you.

39:34.600 --> 39:37.600
It looks like I need to stay longer.
Thank you.

39:37.680 --> 39:40.640
-You were due to leave tomorrow, correct?
-Correct.

39:40.720 --> 39:45.640
I'm afraid we have a union group
from Leverkusen coming. First of May.

39:45.720 --> 39:49.400
-The workers' fight day. You know.
-I'd take the broom cupboard.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.920
I'm really sorry. We're fully booked
until the weekend. All rooms.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.320
Thank you.

39:58.680 --> 40:00.280
<i>My dearest Gereon,</i>

40:02.040 --> 40:04.880
<i>Today it's been exactly four weeks</i>
<i>since you left Cologne.</i>

40:06.040 --> 40:08.440
<i>Slowly it's beginning to feel</i>
<i>like those days</i>

40:08.520 --> 40:10.640
<i>when you two and your brother went to war</i>

40:10.720 --> 40:13.000
<i>and the days were</i>
<i>creepingly becoming longer.</i>

40:13.840 --> 40:17.760
<i>You said in yesterday's letter</i>
<i>that you're about to solve the case.</i>

40:18.520 --> 40:19.760
<i>That keeps me up at night.</i>

40:20.800 --> 40:22.640
<i>Promise you'll be careful.</i>

40:22.720 --> 40:25.680
<i>Berlin's streets are rougher</i>
<i>than anywhere else in the Reich.</i>

40:26.600 --> 40:28.760
<i>Even though I know you'll be back soon,</i>

40:29.120 --> 40:31.440
<i>I can't conceal the fact</i>
<i>that my heart is afraid</i>

40:31.520 --> 40:33.480
<i>when I switch off the light at night</i>

40:33.560 --> 40:36.880
<i>and try to wrestle</i>
<i>a little bit more mercy out of God</i>

40:37.280 --> 40:40.640
<i>so that nothing may happen to you</i>
<i>in this big, strange city.</i>

40:42.560 --> 40:45.000
<i>With greetings and kisses. Yours, Helga.</i>

40:46.760 --> 40:50.680
<i>P.S. Moritz also sends his regards</i>
<i>to the capital of the Reich.</i>

41:30.640 --> 41:31.480
Good evening.

41:33.480 --> 41:34.720
Want a shot with that?

41:36.520 --> 41:37.360
Thank you.

43:11.440 --> 43:12.760
WORKERS! STEP FORTH AND FIGHT
FOR A FOURTH INTERNATIONAL

43:12.840 --> 43:14.080
AND THE WORLD REVOLUTION

43:32.480 --> 43:34.680
-Hi, Sergey. Everyone here?
-Everyone's here.

43:39.400 --> 43:40.480
Comrades.

43:41.280 --> 43:44.840
A few hours ago I received a message
from our comrades at home.

43:50.560 --> 43:53.640
The train crossed the border this morning.

43:54.040 --> 43:55.680
It's coming straight to Berlin!

43:58.080 --> 44:00.880
Long live the Fourth International!

44:00.960 --> 44:03.280
Down with Stalin!

44:03.400 --> 44:05.480
Long live our comrade Trotsky!

44:05.880 --> 44:07.440
Long live the Red Fortress!

44:11.040 --> 44:15.360
-Reinvent the world in a better way.
-No less!
