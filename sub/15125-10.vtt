WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:04.105
(bells dinging)

00:05.939 --> 00:07.975
NARRATOR:
All the Nates down
in Natesville

00:08.008 --> 00:09.910
liked Christmas a lot,

00:09.943 --> 00:13.314
from its oldest old person

00:13.347 --> 00:16.517
to its tiniest tot.

00:16.550 --> 00:21.889
'Twas a time for good neighbors
to sip spiked radish punch,

00:21.922 --> 00:26.394
to hang lights at high heights,
and drink eggnog for lunch.

00:26.427 --> 00:30.264
They ate kazoo cookies
till their stomachs grew sore,

00:30.298 --> 00:33.267
then forgot why they stopped
and ate a few more.

00:33.301 --> 00:35.303
(laughter)

00:39.373 --> 00:43.411
Yes, everyone's hearts brimmed
over with holiday cheer.

00:49.083 --> 00:52.052
Except for one, inside the man

00:52.086 --> 00:55.055
who sits alone way up here.

00:55.089 --> 00:57.791
Stupid Christmas.

00:59.793 --> 01:01.995
(whistling "Deck the Halls")

01:07.435 --> 01:09.470
NARRATOR:
You might be asking yourself,

01:09.503 --> 01:13.641
"What's with the sad surly man
and his Santa-like dog?

01:13.674 --> 01:15.543
"Who sapped Burt's spirits?

01:15.576 --> 01:17.311
"Who de-yuled his log?

01:17.345 --> 01:19.380
"And why is he up there?

01:19.413 --> 01:21.815
His family's way down below!"

01:21.849 --> 01:27.255
It all began on Thanksgiving,
about four weeks ago.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.989
(marching band plays tune,
crowd chatter)

01:29.022 --> 01:30.291
SABRINA:
Virginia,

01:30.324 --> 01:31.825
over here.

01:31.859 --> 01:33.461
It's my fault we're late.

01:33.494 --> 01:35.663
I couldn't find my
turkey ass sweatshirt.

01:35.696 --> 01:38.566
Without the ass,
mine's just a tacky sweatshirt.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.134
Ooh, ooh, the mayor's float.

01:40.168 --> 01:42.670
Hopefully, she sobered up
this year.

01:42.703 --> 01:45.139
Happy Thanksgiving!

01:45.173 --> 01:46.740
Happy Thanksgiving!

01:46.774 --> 01:48.108
(laughs)

01:48.142 --> 01:49.610
(ululating like a turkey)

01:49.643 --> 01:50.844
(laughs)

01:50.878 --> 01:52.846
Oh, that looks so fun.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.682
I wish I had that job.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.450
Mayor?
No, mayor's husband.

01:56.484 --> 01:58.519
He gets to execute
the turkey every year.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.987
(loud crowd chatter)

02:00.020 --> 02:02.190
(turkey squawks)

02:02.223 --> 02:03.824
Ooh, here we go.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.659
Oh, she gets me all tingly.

02:07.161 --> 02:09.330
Why are the drunk ones
always married?

02:09.363 --> 02:12.400
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

02:14.168 --> 02:16.270
Is that you, Virginia?

02:16.304 --> 02:20.208
NARRATOR: And right there and
then, in the crowd's full view,

02:20.241 --> 02:22.876
the mayor fell off the wagon
in not one way...

02:22.910 --> 02:25.379
(screams)
...but two.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.547
(gasps and groans)

02:26.580 --> 02:27.881
Whoa! Drunk
mayor down.

02:27.915 --> 02:29.383
Mayor Hellman!
(groans softly)

02:29.417 --> 02:30.684
Are you okay?

02:30.718 --> 02:32.520
Looks like the mayor's
going back to rehab.

02:32.553 --> 02:33.687
Happy Thanksgiving.

02:33.721 --> 02:34.688
I wonder who we'll elect

02:34.722 --> 02:35.856
to be interim
mayor this time.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.458
If I were mayor,

02:37.491 --> 02:39.693
I'd turn the town seal
into a shark,

02:39.727 --> 02:41.829
so it could eat
the other towns' seals.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.732
If I were mayor, I'd probably
forget I was the mayor.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.835
If I were mayor, I'd get rid
of the mandatory retirement age.

02:47.868 --> 02:49.169
I think
old people

02:49.203 --> 02:50.704
are more capable
than we realize.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.374
If I were mayor, I'd probably
forget I was the mayor.

02:53.407 --> 02:56.744
I think I'd want to be mayor
so Virginia could be first lady.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.078
Then she could
light the tree

02:58.111 --> 02:59.247
at the town's
Christmas celebration.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.814
That would be the
best gift ever.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.216
I usually just
give her batteries

03:02.250 --> 03:03.584
'cause I know
she'll use them.

03:03.617 --> 03:05.586
Well, everyone needs batteries.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.421
My two moms go through them
like crazy.

03:07.455 --> 03:10.591
She likes batteries, but
it would be great to wow her.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.925
She'd flip out
if she could light

03:11.959 --> 03:13.261
the Natesville Christmas tree.

03:13.294 --> 03:16.163
You know, Burt, you being mayor
isn't the craziest idea.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.432
I mean, why not Burt Chance?

03:18.466 --> 03:19.900
NARRATOR:
Why not Burt Chance?

03:19.933 --> 03:21.502
He made so many friends.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.703
Hi, neighbor.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.272
We're taking advantage
of our stop sign

03:24.305 --> 03:25.439
to add a little friendliness

03:25.473 --> 03:26.940
to our community
and say hi to folks.

03:26.974 --> 03:28.609
NARRATOR:
He helped plants shed

03:28.642 --> 03:30.110
their excessive split ends.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.280
What are you doing
so far from home?

03:32.313 --> 03:34.348
And you're a mess.

03:34.382 --> 03:37.217
Nah. I'll have you pruned up
in no time.

03:37.251 --> 03:40.254
NARRATOR: He kept even the
smallest of creatures in mind.
I got him, Virginia.

03:40.288 --> 03:42.290
(insect buzzing)
I got him!

03:42.323 --> 03:44.024
Today, you live!

03:44.057 --> 03:45.259
(buzzing)

03:45.293 --> 03:47.094
No!

03:47.127 --> 03:50.130
NARRATOR:
Once helped out a pig
who was helping the blind.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.699
(pig whining,
horn honking)

03:51.732 --> 03:53.267
Good job, pig.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.602
(snorting)

03:54.635 --> 03:58.138
Yeah. Why not?

03:58.171 --> 04:00.974
NARRATOR:
So Burt and Virginia,
with their usual pluck,

04:01.008 --> 04:03.977
went out to campaign
after pimping Burt's truck.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.379
Burt for mayor!

04:05.413 --> 04:06.647
Why not Burt?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.549
You got anybody better?
We didn't think so.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.817
NARRATOR:
He spoke to vets.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.552
Veterans are
our greatest heroes.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.421
NARRATOR:
And people with nets.

04:13.454 --> 04:16.990
Butterfly collectors
are our greatest heroes.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.594
NARRATOR:
He even spoke to some people
who dressed up like pets.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.664
I don't understand what's
going on here, but...

04:23.697 --> 04:25.833
you seem like our
greatest heroes.

04:25.866 --> 04:28.836
NARRATOR:
And when they were done
with their whistle-stop rants,

04:28.869 --> 04:30.804
all anyone could say was...

04:30.838 --> 04:32.840
ALL:
Why not Burt Chance?

04:32.873 --> 04:34.842
Why not
Burt Chance?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.644
Why not Burt Chance?

04:36.677 --> 04:39.780
Why not Burt Chance?
Why not...?

04:39.813 --> 04:42.683
NARRATOR:
While Virginia and Burt
campaigned very hard,

04:42.716 --> 04:46.019
Jimmy and Sabrina posed
for this year's Christmas card.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.021
Come on, Hope.
It's Santa.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.490
You love Santa.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.825
NARRATOR:
Hope's very first Christmas,

04:51.859 --> 04:55.463
her mom's reputation
gave Hope a bad rap

04:55.496 --> 04:57.264
with the church congregation.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.100
We just can't overlook the fact
that she's a murderer's baby.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.870
NARRATOR: Try as they might
to get Hope some salvation,

05:02.903 --> 05:06.206
her ill-equipped family
caused more irritation.

05:06.239 --> 05:09.209
Looks like we're not gonna be
on the news.

05:09.242 --> 05:11.945
And Hope's gonna still be known
as the murderer's baby.

05:11.979 --> 05:15.616
NARRATOR: One year Jimmy
got wasted, and being a dope,

05:15.649 --> 05:17.851
he wished for a world
where he never had Hope.

05:17.885 --> 05:22.556
I wish I had never picked up
Lucy in my van.

05:22.590 --> 05:25.559
NARRATOR: That silly wish caused
all kinds of strife,

05:25.593 --> 05:28.896
and we sort of ripped off
It's a Wonderful Life.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.964
Merry Christmas, Dancin' Dan!

05:30.998 --> 05:33.233
It's Christmas?

05:33.266 --> 05:35.503
NARRATOR: Christmas 2012
gave Hope a good fright

05:35.536 --> 05:39.306
with Virginia so sure
the Mayan doomsday was right.

05:39.339 --> 05:42.410
Sabrina, you shouldn't have!

05:42.443 --> 05:45.913
NARRATOR: All in the family
seemed ripe for a fight.

05:45.946 --> 05:47.347
(grunting)

05:47.381 --> 05:51.585
'Twas a horrible, deplorable,
spit-orable night.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.320
Ah, come on, Hope.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.988
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.156
Santa's our friend.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.525
Here, watch.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.259
I'll take my picture with him.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.097
(sighs)

06:04.131 --> 06:06.534
Okay, James, go on,
flip the switch.

06:06.567 --> 06:07.234
(beep)

06:07.267 --> 06:08.536
Ho, ho, ho.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.070
(choking):
Help.
Merry Christmas!

06:10.103 --> 06:10.871
Help!

06:10.904 --> 06:12.339
(choking):
Help.
Ho, ho, ho.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.207
(distorted):
Merry Chris...

06:14.241 --> 06:15.443
(all exclaim)

06:15.476 --> 06:16.677
Merry...

06:16.710 --> 06:17.511
See?

06:17.545 --> 06:18.746
SANTA:
Ho, ho...

06:22.483 --> 06:25.252
Welcome to interim mayor
election results.

06:25.285 --> 06:26.720
Shh!
It's on!
Ooh.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.556
In a few minutes,

06:28.589 --> 06:31.525
this channel switches over
to our nightly lotto results.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.093
If I seem rushed,

06:33.126 --> 06:34.795
I apologize.

06:34.828 --> 06:39.199
In third place, with one vote:
Ralph Nader.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.469
Every year I try.

06:41.502 --> 06:44.104
In second place, Burt Chance.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.940
Oh.
Well, you gave it
your best, Dad.

06:46.974 --> 06:50.310
And first place is:
more fresh veggies.

06:50.343 --> 06:51.912
But I'm thinking
that's because Howdy's collected

06:51.945 --> 06:54.982
these ballots
in their old suggestion box.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.618
So I guess
Burt Chance is mayor.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.219
Congratulations, Mr. Ch...

06:59.252 --> 07:01.421
MAN: Tonight's winning
lottery numbers are...

07:01.455 --> 07:03.290
Burt, you did it.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.625
You won!

07:04.658 --> 07:06.426
Natesville chose me.

07:06.460 --> 07:07.961
You're mayor.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.162
You're first lady.

07:09.196 --> 07:11.331
(gasps)
I'm first lady!

07:11.364 --> 07:15.302
NARRATOR:
Would Burt be the greatest
mayor that his town's ever had?

07:15.335 --> 07:18.606
You'll only find out
after watching this ad.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.411
(playing "Hail to the Chief")
NARRATOR:
You just saw some commercials

07:24.444 --> 07:26.914
for home, health and hair,
but while you were gone,

07:26.947 --> 07:29.750
Burt was sworn in as mayor.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.152
Burt, this is amazing.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.588
You are the interim mayor
of Natesville.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.456
Power, influence.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.626
Plus, I think we get
all new cabinets.

07:38.659 --> 07:40.694
Those things are good,
but the best part is,

07:40.728 --> 07:43.196
this year, for Christmas,
I get to give you the gift

07:43.230 --> 07:45.032
of lighting the tree
at the Christmas festival.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.700
Oh, it's been my dream

07:46.734 --> 07:48.636
since I was a little
girl to light that tree.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.103
And I deem it so.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.039
Oh, could Hope stand
in the front row

07:52.072 --> 07:53.974
of the Christmas choir
so I could get a good picture?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.844
So let it be written,
so let it be done.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.211
Isn't that so great, Hope?

07:58.245 --> 07:59.613
Isn't that great?

07:59.647 --> 08:01.048
How about you, Jimmy?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.850
What's your Christmas wish?

08:02.883 --> 08:04.718
I sort of wish
you'd resign as mayor.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.386
And, like every
other Christmas wish

08:06.419 --> 08:08.789
you've had since you were five,
that's not gonna happen.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.191
Well, you know,
it's just, in the past,

08:11.224 --> 08:14.995
all the other interim mayors
let the job go to their heads

08:15.028 --> 08:17.631
and became power-hungry
dictators.

08:17.665 --> 08:21.134
As interim mayor, let me start
by saying thank you.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.805
And let me end by saying,
I just sold the church bells

08:24.838 --> 08:26.907
to a delicious
national taco chain.

08:26.940 --> 08:29.476
(crowd booing)

08:29.509 --> 08:31.178
I am closing Main Street

08:31.211 --> 08:34.548
to vehicular traffic
effective immediately.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.883
(crowd booing)
WOMAN:
Why did you do that?!

08:35.916 --> 08:37.918
No further questions!

08:37.951 --> 08:39.419
I'm ending
school lunch programs.

08:39.452 --> 08:40.754
What?
You suck!

08:40.788 --> 08:42.923
Students' meals
must now be homemade

08:42.956 --> 08:45.726
with groceries bought
from local stores.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.360
(crowd booing)

08:47.394 --> 08:49.229
On a purely coincidental note,

08:49.262 --> 08:53.533
brown bags and bologna are now
half off at Howdy's.

08:53.567 --> 08:55.535
Jimmy, I'm not like
all those other mayors.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.605
They took the job
with a selfish agenda.

08:57.638 --> 08:59.840
I just want to get some
special treats for my family.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.341
Yeah, Jimmy.
It's Christmas.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.611
Stop trying to Scrooge us
out of something good.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.413
Excuse me. Mayor Chance?

09:06.446 --> 09:08.682
Yes, minion.

09:08.716 --> 09:11.551
Wow. What a spectacular
inauguration party.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.186
Yeah.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.254
This is Theo...

09:14.287 --> 09:15.455
Oh.
(whining)

09:15.488 --> 09:16.790
...the mayor's dog.
Oh.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.126
He's yours
for the next 28 days.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.094
Wow, that's a lot
of responsibility.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.130
(whining)

09:24.397 --> 09:26.133
This is what Mayor Hellman
was working on

09:26.166 --> 09:29.369
before she slipped back
into... exhaustion.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.439
"Confidential.
Mayor's eyes only."

09:33.506 --> 09:35.142
That means you probably
shouldn't read

09:35.175 --> 09:36.810
the rest of it out loud.

09:36.844 --> 09:39.613
Oh.

09:39.647 --> 09:41.181
What the what?

09:43.583 --> 09:46.987
NARRATOR:
Once Burt figured out what
the news that he'd seen meant,

09:47.020 --> 09:50.123
he went to the mayor
who had snuck out of treatment.

09:50.157 --> 09:51.591
(gasps)
Burt?

09:51.625 --> 09:53.293
Hi.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.163
(clears her throat)

09:56.196 --> 09:57.831
I got to make this fast.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.668
Rumor is, a celebrity's
coming in.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.336
Please be a Baldwin!
Please be a Baldwin!

10:03.370 --> 10:06.273
I want to thank you for agreeing
to speak to me, Your Honor.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.407
Look, we have a problem.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.576
Uh, did you bring
the moisturizing

10:09.609 --> 10:11.111
dandruff shampoo
from my office shower?
Oh, sorry.

10:11.144 --> 10:13.914
Yeah, attaboy.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.783
Wow.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.685
That shampoo smells
a lot like tequila.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.120
What's your problem, Burt?

10:20.153 --> 10:22.022
Is it true what it
said in the file?

10:22.055 --> 10:23.791
You sold the pool to
a fertilizer company.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.292
Now we can't pay the rent.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.127
Now they're gonna build a giant
poop factory on top of it,

10:27.160 --> 10:28.161
and we'll lose
the pool forever?

10:28.195 --> 10:29.863
I'm afraid so.

10:29.897 --> 10:31.298
Rinse and repeat.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.701
Why did we sell the
pool in the first place?

10:33.734 --> 10:35.168
We sold the pool
to get the money

10:35.202 --> 10:36.970
to fix the fire damage
at the power plant,

10:37.004 --> 10:38.706
because the income
from the power plant

10:38.739 --> 10:40.440
helps us fund
the fire department,

10:40.473 --> 10:43.510
which we need because the power
plant keeps catching on fire.

10:43.543 --> 10:44.611
I'm gonna run
this by Virginia.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.645
She's the money
guru in our house.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.780
She'll think of something.

10:46.814 --> 10:47.948
No, no, no.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.449
You can't tell
your wife or anyone

10:49.482 --> 10:51.051
how close we are
to financial apocalypse.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.820
We're like
a poorly-knitted sweater, Burt.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.554
Pull one thread,

10:54.587 --> 10:56.824
and you're standing
in front of a whole town

10:56.857 --> 10:58.491
in nothing but your custom bra

10:58.525 --> 11:01.394
that makes
your uneven boobs look normal.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.230
Or whatever the male equivalent
of that is.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.497
I'm gonna miss that pool.

11:04.531 --> 11:05.899
Yeah.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.835
I never knew being mayor meant
making such tough choices.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.037
There is one city budget item
you could cut

11:10.070 --> 11:11.705
that would probably
save the pool.

11:11.739 --> 11:15.542
But no mayor has ever had
the stones to try it.

11:15.575 --> 11:19.379
NARRATOR:
While Burt was told the mayor's
pool-saving plan,

11:19.412 --> 11:22.482
Virginia saw trees
with a tree-sawing man.

11:22.515 --> 11:26.653
Ooh, Dick, this one's gonna
look great in the town square.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.722
No, wait. This one.

11:29.723 --> 11:31.391
No.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.760
This one!

11:32.793 --> 11:34.327
Yes, 100%,

11:34.361 --> 11:36.563
definitely, I promise.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.431
Nope. Changed my mind.

11:38.465 --> 11:39.867
(phone ringing)

11:39.900 --> 11:41.501
Hello.

11:41.534 --> 11:45.572
I told you the power would go
to his head! Listen!

11:45.605 --> 11:47.107
Once again,
effective immediately,

11:47.140 --> 11:49.509
Natesville's Christmas
celebration has been canceled.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.744
No further questions.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.212
I'm the mayor,
and my word is law.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.781
(crowd booing)
You suck!

11:53.814 --> 11:55.849
NARRATOR:
Virginia thought
Jimmy was playing a trick,

11:55.883 --> 11:58.952
but alas, it was true,
Burt turned into a...

11:58.986 --> 12:00.453
(saw buzzing)
Dick, don't cut down that tree!

12:04.624 --> 12:06.259
NARRATOR:
A mob chased Burt home
with hollers and hoots...

12:06.293 --> 12:09.296
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm the mayor,
and you're glue.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.731
Whatever I say becomes law.

12:11.765 --> 12:15.803
...and pelted his door
with cakes made of fruits.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.137
VIRGINIA:
You canceled

12:17.170 --> 12:18.371
the Christmas festival?!

12:18.405 --> 12:20.140
That's the one thing
in this town

12:20.173 --> 12:21.708
that every single person loves!

12:21.741 --> 12:24.311
Uh, pretty sure everyone loves
that pool, too.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.146
Well, sure,
nothing beats the pool,

12:26.179 --> 12:28.115
but the pool's going
to be around forever.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.818
Please tell me
there's a good reason for this.

12:30.851 --> 12:32.986
There is.
There's a very good reason.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.788
Thank God.
What is it?

12:34.822 --> 12:36.456
I took an oath.
I can't tell anyone.

12:39.359 --> 12:44.932
Okay. What if you don't tell me,
but I guess?

12:44.965 --> 12:47.300
That could work.

12:47.334 --> 12:49.336
NARRATOR:
Virginia knew
all Burt's secrets,

12:49.369 --> 12:51.171
even those in his toes.

12:51.204 --> 12:55.675
Like how one twitched when
he lied, like Pinocchio's nose.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.580
Did you cancel
the Christmas festival

13:00.613 --> 13:02.749
because aliens will use
brightly-colored trees

13:02.782 --> 13:03.917
as their landing beacons?

13:03.951 --> 13:05.986
No.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.189
(sighs)
Okay.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.991
Did you cancel it

13:11.024 --> 13:14.594
because the idea of reindeer,
candy canes and trees

13:14.627 --> 13:16.629
has nothing to do with the
actual meaning of the holiday?

13:16.663 --> 13:19.332
No.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.001
All right.

13:21.034 --> 13:23.136
Well, those are
the two most obvious ones.

13:23.170 --> 13:27.040
This is a pretty big swing.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.877
(clicks her tongue)

13:29.910 --> 13:32.112
Is the city out of money?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.147
No.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.184
Bingo!

13:37.217 --> 13:39.319
There's no money
for the Christmas festival.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.155
I think my toes have
said too much already.

13:44.091 --> 13:47.127
NARRATOR:
So Virginia got
a brilliant idea.

13:47.160 --> 13:51.164
An awfully brilliant,
resilient idea.

13:51.198 --> 13:53.366
Grab everything Christmasy.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.468
If Natesville can't afford
a Christmas festival,

13:55.502 --> 13:57.170
then we're doing it ourselves.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.340
NARRATOR:
So Maw Maw and Burt,
with the help of his spouse,

14:00.373 --> 14:05.045
grabbed bows and a card
from their pen pal in Laos.

14:05.078 --> 14:09.416
They took every ornament
and each candy cane,

14:09.449 --> 14:13.053
and also the pillow
for Maw Maw's butt pain.

14:15.255 --> 14:18.258
The family Chance snuck
into Howdy's with stealth

14:18.291 --> 14:21.261
to snatch holiday trinkets
and clear every shelf.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.932
They even ripped off
the security elf.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.734
Oh, this is going
to be such a great festival!

14:27.767 --> 14:29.602
It's too bad
you can't be there.

14:29.636 --> 14:31.071
Oh, I'm gonna be there.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.240
No way I'm gonna miss your
mother lighting that tree.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.741
I got to see that
look on her face.

14:34.774 --> 14:36.443
But the whole town
is mad at you.

14:36.476 --> 14:38.711
You might get candy-caned...
or shot.

14:38.745 --> 14:41.381
They won't even know I'm there.
I'm going in disguise.

14:41.414 --> 14:43.050
I'll give you a hint.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.685
He wears a red furry suit
and says "Ho, ho, ho."

14:45.718 --> 14:46.920
You're going as a pimp?

14:46.954 --> 14:48.221
Santa Claus.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.957
I'll be going as
Santa Claus, Jimmy.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.358
NARRATOR:
There was a chance

14:51.391 --> 14:53.626
that the Chances
might just save the day.

14:53.660 --> 14:55.462
Sabrina was stacked.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.065
Well, with wreaths, anyway.

15:00.000 --> 15:03.203
One fresh from the womb,
one close to the crypt.

15:03.236 --> 15:07.240
They grabbed all the goodies
their weak hands could grip.

15:07.274 --> 15:11.844
While wreath after wreath
after wreath was unclipped.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.820
Since sugar plums, not brains,
danced in their head,

15:20.853 --> 15:24.824
they thought one tiny dog
could pull one giant sled.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.627
But try as they might,
that dog wouldn't mush,

15:27.660 --> 15:32.432
so Burt climbed down
and started to push.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.502
And in order to get
all Natesvillians to meet,

15:35.535 --> 15:38.605
Sabrina sent out
an emergency tweet.

15:38.638 --> 15:41.508
(phone chirps)

15:41.541 --> 15:45.478
The word of a party
soon spread far and near,

15:45.512 --> 15:49.983
and Natesvillians came calling,
all filled with great cheer.

15:50.017 --> 15:53.786
Yes, everyone pitched in
to make Christmas greater.

15:53.820 --> 15:57.690
Of course, some made decisions
they might regret later.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.363
Merry Christmas.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.365
Ho, ho, ho!

16:05.398 --> 16:07.167
Santa, it's working.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.136
This might be
the best Christmas ever.

16:09.169 --> 16:11.804
I know. Look,
even the Hoos are here.

16:11.838 --> 16:13.006
Hello, Hoos!

16:13.040 --> 16:15.142
NARRATOR:
It was all going well.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.110
They were feeling quite smug

16:17.144 --> 16:21.514
until one little Hoo
tugged a curious tug.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.649
Wait a minute.

16:22.682 --> 16:25.885
Burt Chance is pretending
to be Santa!

16:25.918 --> 16:26.653
Oh.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.988
You can't cancel the festival,

16:29.022 --> 16:30.990
and then just
show up and celebrate it!

16:31.024 --> 16:33.126
Even if you are the mayor!

16:33.160 --> 16:34.727
(booing)
NARRATOR:
Since the littlest Hoo

16:34.761 --> 16:36.563
had spoiled the fun,

16:36.596 --> 16:40.367
now Burt had to do
what he knew must be done.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.135
I'm sorry. I'm leaving.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.736
NARRATOR:
And as Burt took his lumps,

16:43.770 --> 16:46.473
maybe more than his share...

16:46.506 --> 16:49.642
Hey! The real mayor is back.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.913
...the town's mood was lifted
by their now sober mayor.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.948
And she's 12 steps hotter.

17:00.787 --> 17:04.257
NARRATOR:
As the mayor swooped in
to steal credit from Burt,

17:04.291 --> 17:07.894
there are only two words
that our hurt Burt could blurt.

17:07.927 --> 17:10.763
Stupid Christmas.

17:12.265 --> 17:14.434
Hello, Natesvillians!

17:14.467 --> 17:15.735
(whoops)

17:15.768 --> 17:17.003
(all cheering)
Natesville!

17:17.036 --> 17:20.240
Oh, gosh, I would like
to thank all of you

17:20.273 --> 17:22.542
for pulling together
as neighbors,

17:22.575 --> 17:24.511
especially
Virginia Chance.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.713
Without her,
we wouldn't be about

17:26.746 --> 17:29.416
to enjoy the most meaningful
Christmas festival

17:29.449 --> 17:31.251
in our town's history!

17:31.284 --> 17:33.420
(applause and cheering)

17:33.453 --> 17:34.887
Where do I plug this in?

17:34.921 --> 17:38.291
Uh, Mrs. Chance, the
outlet's over there.

17:38.325 --> 17:41.961
NARRATOR:
But just as she could taste
a victory so sweet,

17:41.994 --> 17:47.234
she'd fallen short of her mark
by 40 yards plus three feet.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.869
(all sighing)

17:49.902 --> 17:51.471
Well, don't...
don't look at me.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.873
I mean, her husband's the one
who canceled Christmas.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.642
I didn't do that.

17:55.675 --> 17:59.112
NARRATOR:
Since the lights were the thing
that made Christmas feel real,

17:59.146 --> 18:01.948
without lights shining
brightly, it lost its appeal.

18:01.981 --> 18:07.053
With no lights and no sparkle,
their Christmas felt bland,

18:07.086 --> 18:11.424
and Virginia just stood there,
her cord in her hand.

18:11.458 --> 18:15.495
Aw, Virginia...
you came so close.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.530
Merry Christmas, Burt.
Aah!

18:18.998 --> 18:21.401
Ah. What are you guys
doing here?

18:21.434 --> 18:24.237
As former interim mayors,
we know the deal, Burt.

18:24.271 --> 18:25.838
We came to see
what you saved

18:25.872 --> 18:27.807
by canceling
the Christmas festival.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.841
The community pool.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.443
ALL:
Oh.

18:30.477 --> 18:32.279
I saw my first boob
at that pool.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.447
Oh, that's a very
special place.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.015
Thanks, Burt.

18:36.048 --> 18:38.117
And thank you, extra-springy
diving board.

18:38.151 --> 18:39.519
But I ruined Christmas.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.020
It's not your fault.

18:41.053 --> 18:43.022
Every time the mayor has
a hard choice to make,

18:43.055 --> 18:44.857
she goes into rehab
and leaves it

18:44.891 --> 18:46.826
to the interim mayors
to take the bullet.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.828
It's okay, Burt.
We all know how you feel.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.663
After I canceled
the school lunch program,

18:50.697 --> 18:52.299
nobody talked to me for a year.

18:52.332 --> 18:55.668
They didn't know that I only
did it to pay for new flu shots

18:55.702 --> 18:57.204
after the ones
the drunk mayor bought

18:57.237 --> 18:59.105
turned out to be Jell-O shots.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.807
And I only sold
the town church bell

19:00.840 --> 19:02.041
to pay the exterminator

19:02.074 --> 19:04.511
to drive the face-eating monkeys
out of the town.

19:04.544 --> 19:06.979
I never saw
any face-eating monkeys.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.181
You're welcome.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.716
Don't worry, Burt.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.551
Natesville is a
very forgiving place.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.553
This town will
get over it.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.188
Yeah, but I didn't get
to give Virginia

19:15.222 --> 19:16.656
the gift of lighting the tree.

19:16.689 --> 19:20.159
Now, I'll have to go back
to giving her batteries.

19:20.193 --> 19:22.895
(gasps)
Batteries.

19:22.929 --> 19:27.133
NARRATOR:
Burt ran down the hill
with all caution unheeded

19:27.166 --> 19:30.970
and gave to Virginia
the exact gift she needed.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.972
Virginia!

19:33.005 --> 19:34.674
Wait!

19:34.707 --> 19:36.075
Don't go!

19:36.108 --> 19:38.044
You have to open
your Christmas present first.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.213
Oh, Burt,
can't we just do it at home?

19:40.247 --> 19:42.549
We have to return all
these ornaments we stole.

19:42.582 --> 19:43.883
Just open this first.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.518
(sighs)

19:51.458 --> 19:54.261
It's just what I wanted.

19:54.294 --> 19:56.195
NARRATOR:
Ignoring the risk
of electrical fire,

19:56.229 --> 20:00.433
Burt hooked up the gift
he hoped would inspire.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.668
Madam First Lady,

20:01.701 --> 20:03.770
would you please fulfill
your holiday duty?

20:03.803 --> 20:05.171
Doodie.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.707
(both laugh)

20:07.740 --> 20:09.776
(electrical popping)
Oh!

20:09.809 --> 20:12.379
NARRATOR:
Her grandpa lighting
those lights

20:12.412 --> 20:14.747
touched Hope's tiny heart,

20:14.781 --> 20:18.351
and a feeling for Christmas
had started to start.

20:18.385 --> 20:21.087
* Christmas

20:21.120 --> 20:22.922
* Christmas...

20:22.955 --> 20:26.559
Hearing Hope belt out her sweet
Christmas sound,

20:26.593 --> 20:30.363
the grumpy Natesvillians
turned right back around.

20:30.397 --> 20:34.467
The holiday song
from this sweet little shorty

20:34.501 --> 20:39.372
reached up to the mayors,
who were sharing a 40.

20:39.406 --> 20:41.641
* Christmas...

20:41.674 --> 20:44.577
The spirit of Christmas
erased every frown.

20:44.611 --> 20:48.581
And the people of Natesville
helped light up their town.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.617
(quiet chatter)

20:50.650 --> 20:53.286
* Christmas

20:53.320 --> 20:57.457
* Christmas...

21:00.693 --> 21:02.395
Yeah.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.964
* Hanukkah...

21:04.997 --> 21:08.601
Oh. Thank you.

21:10.637 --> 21:12.405
NARRATOR:
Burt's battery plan brought

21:12.439 --> 21:14.240
lights back to the city,

21:14.273 --> 21:17.477
and the town soon forgave him
for being so...

21:17.510 --> 21:19.145
Snow!

21:19.178 --> 21:21.448
(all gasping)

21:21.481 --> 21:24.351
It's a climate change
Christmas miracle.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.620
NARRATOR: Christmas was saved,
and the lights brightly shone.

21:27.654 --> 21:30.923
We should probably say here,
don't try this at home.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.191
(electrical popping)

21:32.224 --> 21:33.826
ALL:
Oh!

21:35.194 --> 21:37.263
Merry Christmas, Mom.

21:37.296 --> 21:39.466
