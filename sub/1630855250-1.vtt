WEBVTT

00:01.238 --> 00:03.305
Emcee 1:
... to say that you saw her
in a laundromat.

00:03.374 --> 00:05.975
Put your hands together big
for Marcella Arguello!

00:06.044 --> 00:09.111
(applause, cheering)

00:09.180 --> 00:11.514
Emcee 2:
Marcella Arguello!

00:11.583 --> 00:12.814
Hey, what's up, guys?

00:12.882 --> 00:15.217
Emcee 3:
She's one of my best friends.
Let's hear it for

00:15.286 --> 00:19.088
-Ms. Marcella Arguello!
-(crowd cheering)

00:19.157 --> 00:21.522
Okay, okay, okay!
Everybody, what's up?

00:21.591 --> 00:23.658
Make some noise.
What's up, what's up,
what's up?

00:23.727 --> 00:25.293
Everybody make some noise.
Keep it going.

00:25.362 --> 00:28.030
Make some motherfucking noise!

00:28.099 --> 00:29.865
What's up, New York?

00:29.934 --> 00:33.438
(applause, cheering)

00:34.604 --> 00:37.072
What's up, y'all?
My name is Marcella.

00:37.141 --> 00:39.875
I'm very tall for a woman,
bitch. Take it in, okay?

00:39.944 --> 00:41.546
-(cheering)
-Yeah.

00:42.781 --> 00:44.145
I'm 6'2".
I'm gonna go over

00:44.214 --> 00:48.283
-a few things I don't wanna
be asked ever again, okay?
-(laughter)

00:48.352 --> 00:50.753
I don't play basketball,
I don't play volleyball,

00:50.822 --> 00:51.854
I'm not a model,

00:51.923 --> 00:53.255
and since I have
everybody's attention,

00:53.324 --> 00:55.224
just wanna let you all know

00:55.293 --> 00:57.259
the tops of your refrigerators
are fucking disgusting.

00:57.328 --> 00:58.994
(laughter, applause)

00:59.063 --> 01:01.157
Clean 'em up!

01:01.226 --> 01:05.367
They're all greasy and dusty
and shit. What's that about?

01:05.436 --> 01:08.037
I get mistaken for a man
sometimes. It's all good.

01:08.106 --> 01:09.633
I don't care.
I'm very confident.

01:09.702 --> 01:11.374
I don't give a fuck, right?

01:11.443 --> 01:12.908
(laughter)

01:12.977 --> 01:14.543
But sometimes,
it hurts my feelings.

01:14.612 --> 01:15.878
(laughter)

01:15.947 --> 01:17.312
When I was flying out
to New York,

01:17.381 --> 01:19.014
as soon as we land-- Now,

01:19.083 --> 01:21.749
I don't look like this
when I fly, right?

01:21.818 --> 01:25.153
I'm, like, sweatpants,
you know, sneakers,
baggy T-shirt,

01:25.222 --> 01:28.423
hair pulled back,
glasses, mask, right? No makeup.

01:28.492 --> 01:31.626
And so, when we land
in New York,

01:31.695 --> 01:34.362
the woman across the aisle,
she-- she props up.

01:34.431 --> 01:37.365
She's a tiny woman.
She props up out of her chair.

01:37.434 --> 01:38.667
You know, she's getting her bag,

01:38.736 --> 01:41.173
but she starts struggling
with her bag.

01:43.573 --> 01:46.345
And then this
fine-ass Black guy

01:47.144 --> 01:48.839
helps her with her bag.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.946
And I was like,
I'm gonna struggle.

01:51.015 --> 01:53.082
(laughter, applause)

01:53.151 --> 01:54.786
With my bag, right?

01:56.520 --> 01:59.221
But like I said, I didn't
look like this, right?

01:59.290 --> 02:01.022
So, I get up, and I'm like,

02:01.091 --> 02:03.528
-"Oh." (pouty sigh)
-(laughter)

02:04.795 --> 02:07.127
"My little wrist.

02:07.632 --> 02:08.964
Owie!"

02:09.033 --> 02:11.100
(groans) And he looks at me.
He's like,

02:11.169 --> 02:12.801
"You got that, bro?"

02:12.870 --> 02:14.970
(laughter)

02:15.039 --> 02:16.105
I didn't give a fuck.
I was like,

02:16.174 --> 02:18.173
"Yeah, it's all good, dog!

02:18.242 --> 02:19.878
-Don't even trip."
-(applause)

02:21.278 --> 02:23.278
I am Latina.
Any Latinos in the house?

02:23.347 --> 02:26.782
-(cheering, applause)
-Nice.

02:26.851 --> 02:28.517
Yeah.

02:28.586 --> 02:31.086
I'm a-- I'm a very proud Latina.

02:31.155 --> 02:32.855
I'm a very proud Latina.
Um...

02:32.924 --> 02:34.184
And it was-- it was--

02:34.253 --> 02:36.524
It's funny because, you know,
because of how I look,

02:36.593 --> 02:38.793
people don't think
I'm Latina, right?

02:38.862 --> 02:41.696
I once, when I worked as
a bank teller, I had this woman.

02:41.765 --> 02:43.565
A lot of people think I'm mixed
with Black and white,

02:43.634 --> 02:45.300
especially in California.
In New York, y'all know.

02:45.369 --> 02:47.602
Y'all don't get it fucked up
in New York. Y'all know.

02:47.671 --> 02:49.638
You guys got everything in
New York, so you're just like,

02:49.707 --> 02:53.608
"Ah, mija !" Right?
As soon as they see me. "Ah!"

02:53.677 --> 02:55.911
But in California, they're--
if you don't look Mexican,
they're like,

02:55.980 --> 02:59.148
-"What?"
-(laughter)

02:59.217 --> 03:02.317
So, I'm working as
a teller, uh, in Cali,

03:02.386 --> 03:05.320
and this customer,
her account was all fucked up,

03:05.389 --> 03:08.990
and she starts talking shit
about me in Spanish

03:09.059 --> 03:11.726
-at the teller window
right in front of me, right?
-(booing)

03:11.795 --> 03:13.495
Probably thought I was mixed
Black and white.

03:13.564 --> 03:15.597
Probably didn't know
I spoke Spanish.

03:15.666 --> 03:18.166
So, she's talking shit. And as
soon as she finishes, I'm like,

03:18.235 --> 03:19.634
"Oh, I'm sorry. (laughs)

03:19.703 --> 03:22.307
"Looks like I won't be able to
help you with this account..."

03:25.243 --> 03:28.313
(applause, cheering)

03:30.080 --> 03:33.414
So, she was upset.
She was upset.

03:33.483 --> 03:35.751
She's upset.
She goes up to my manager.

03:35.820 --> 03:38.353
She's like, "Oh, my God!

03:38.422 --> 03:40.756
This young woman just called me
an old bitch in Spanish."

03:40.825 --> 03:42.958
And my manager was like,
"(gasps) Wha...

03:43.027 --> 03:45.393
She is Black and white!
She don't speak Spanish!"

03:45.462 --> 03:48.196
I was like... (imitates airhorn)

03:48.265 --> 03:50.132
Wu-Tang is for the children!

03:50.201 --> 03:52.771
Bobby Digital!
(beeping) Um...

03:54.138 --> 03:57.740
-Stupid bitch. Um...
-(laughter)

03:57.809 --> 03:59.675
It's crazy though because,
like, you know,

03:59.744 --> 04:01.243
Latinos, we're everything,
right?

04:01.312 --> 04:03.378
We're the blackest Black,
we're the whitest white.

04:03.447 --> 04:05.647
We look like every--
We are everybody, right?

04:05.716 --> 04:09.284
That's why we're
taking over, girl, ha! Um...

04:09.353 --> 04:11.018
But it's-it's a mind-fuck
in Hollywood, too,

04:11.087 --> 04:13.521
because, like Sofia Vergara--
I don't know if you guys know,

04:13.590 --> 04:15.758
but Sofia Vergara,
when she got "Modern Family,"

04:15.827 --> 04:18.427
it was because
she dyed her hair brown,

04:18.496 --> 04:20.895
so she could look
"more Latina," right?

04:20.964 --> 04:23.559
Which is crazy. That's fucked up
that she had to do that.

04:23.628 --> 04:26.301
And then when she got the role
on "Modern Family,"
what happened?

04:26.370 --> 04:28.671
The Latinos gave her backlash

04:28.740 --> 04:30.705
because she was
"too stereotypical."

04:30.774 --> 04:32.608
They didn't like the way
she represented Latinos.

04:32.677 --> 04:34.009
And I was like, (clicks tongue)

04:34.078 --> 04:36.779
I got a lot of family members
that act like her, okay?

04:36.848 --> 04:38.580
(laughter)

04:38.649 --> 04:41.686
Yeah, it's my gay Uncles
pero still, you know, like?

04:43.020 --> 04:45.057
They deserve representation.

04:48.025 --> 04:50.992
So, because I grew up
in a conservative, uh, town,

04:51.061 --> 04:53.462
I-- you know,
I don't identify as white.
I don't.

04:53.531 --> 04:56.331
I identify as white-passing,
and the difference

04:56.400 --> 04:58.533
between white
and white-passing

04:58.602 --> 05:01.870
is that I would never put
my parents in a nursing home.

05:01.939 --> 05:04.006
-Um...
-(applause)

05:04.075 --> 05:07.710
-(laughs) Oh shit.
-(cheering)

05:07.779 --> 05:09.014
Thank you.

05:10.414 --> 05:12.481
Hey, man, shout out to
all y'all for coming out.

05:12.550 --> 05:13.748
We appreciate you.

05:13.817 --> 05:15.350
I can't have you guys
applauding every joke.

05:15.419 --> 05:17.652
-I don't got that kind of time.
Please don't do that.
-(laughter)

05:17.721 --> 05:19.788
Just laugh. I-I don't wanna
fuckin' fuck my shit up

05:19.857 --> 05:22.494
'cause y'all are too excited.
Um...

05:23.593 --> 05:25.756
-(laughs)
-(laughter, indistinct yell)

05:25.825 --> 05:28.230
I know, girl. Um...

05:28.299 --> 05:31.467
So, the pandemic fucked
shit up, right?

05:31.536 --> 05:32.768
I think it-- it changed me.

05:32.837 --> 05:34.169
I don't know if it
changed you, guys.

05:34.238 --> 05:36.571
I appreciate you guys
all coming out.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.408
You guys aren't wearing masks.
What is wrong with you?

05:38.477 --> 05:39.407
I don't know.

05:39.476 --> 05:42.343
Shout out to you, sir.
Thank you.

05:42.412 --> 05:44.612
Um, but the pandemic
changed me.

05:44.681 --> 05:46.447
Remember at the begin--
It's been so long, right?

05:46.516 --> 05:48.016
It's been so long.
Remember at the beginning,

05:48.085 --> 05:51.019
people were posting
stupid shit on social media?

05:51.088 --> 05:53.088
I had hella friends just
posting the dumbest shit.

05:53.157 --> 05:54.589
I had one friend that was like,

05:54.658 --> 05:57.226
(mocking):
"I just cut my own hair
for the first time ever.

05:57.295 --> 05:58.793
Hashtag bangs."

05:58.862 --> 06:01.696
-(laughter)
-I had another homegirl
who was like,

06:01.765 --> 06:04.132
(mocking):
"Just painted my own nails
for the first time ever.

06:04.201 --> 06:06.668
-Hashtag DIY."
-(laughter)

06:06.737 --> 06:08.403
I had a homeboy who was like,

06:08.472 --> 06:10.738
"Just cooked every meal for
the first time this week

06:10.807 --> 06:13.276
in my whole life." I was like,
have you guys never been broke?

06:13.345 --> 06:14.575
(laughter)

06:14.644 --> 06:17.247
Hashtag hella broke.
You guys never been broke, ever?

06:17.316 --> 06:18.914
Okay. Alright.

06:18.983 --> 06:21.016
I know who I'm gonna
hit up for bail money.

06:21.085 --> 06:22.617
(laughter, applause)

06:22.686 --> 06:24.753
And then, the vaccine
rollout happened,

06:24.822 --> 06:26.655
and I was so excited,
you know,

06:26.724 --> 06:29.692
because being single during
the pandemic was rough, right?

06:29.761 --> 06:31.860
-(audience agreeing)
-It was rough!

06:31.929 --> 06:33.729
Me and all my homegirls
were so excited

06:33.798 --> 06:34.997
when the vaccine
rollout happened.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.531
We were just like
in the group chat, like,

06:36.600 --> 06:38.233
"Oh, I can't wait
to get back out there."

06:38.302 --> 06:41.097
"Yeah, me--"
Bitch, I was so desperate,

06:41.166 --> 06:43.439
I almost ordered
a male sex robot.

06:43.508 --> 06:45.235
(laughter)

06:45.304 --> 06:46.608
That's where I was at,
but with my luck,

06:46.677 --> 06:48.711
it was gonna show up
and be 5'6".

06:48.780 --> 06:50.212
(laughter)

06:50.281 --> 06:51.480
I turn it on, it be like,

06:51.549 --> 06:54.116
(robotic):
"I am 5'9". Beep, boop, boop."

06:54.185 --> 06:57.417
(applause, laughter)

06:58.255 --> 06:59.554
I don't know why, y'all men,

06:59.623 --> 07:01.156
you guys always lie
about your height.

07:01.225 --> 07:02.892
I don't know
what that's about.

07:02.961 --> 07:04.659
Men lie so much
about their height,

07:04.728 --> 07:07.896
they accuse me of
being seven feet tall.

07:07.965 --> 07:09.531
(laughter)

07:09.600 --> 07:11.866
That's happened
more than three times.

07:11.935 --> 07:15.204
You realize how
fucked up that is?
Anyways, alright.

07:15.273 --> 07:19.041
So, I was getting--
I was getting thirsty, man.
It was hard.

07:19.110 --> 07:20.676
And then, in the group chat,
we were all like,

07:20.745 --> 07:21.877
I just wanna get
back out there.

07:21.946 --> 07:23.612
I'm gonna join the dating
websites. Me, too.

07:23.681 --> 07:24.780
And one of my homegirls
was like,

07:24.849 --> 07:27.086
"Marcella,
I just miss kissing."

07:27.780 --> 07:29.418
(laughter)

07:29.487 --> 07:31.186
I was like, "It's been
two years, bitch.

07:31.255 --> 07:33.155
I wanna be railed into a wall."

07:33.224 --> 07:36.091
(applause, laughter)

07:36.160 --> 07:38.761
I want a dude to blow
my back out so hard.

07:38.830 --> 07:42.067
my scoliosis reverses,
you feel me?

07:44.902 --> 07:46.634
God damn.

07:46.703 --> 07:49.604
Kissing. I don't even kiss
one-night stands.

07:49.673 --> 07:52.174
I had a one-night stand try
to kiss me once. I was like,

07:52.243 --> 07:54.076
"Sir, ew! I don't know you!"

07:54.145 --> 07:57.012
(laughter)

07:57.081 --> 08:00.148
-Now, let's go raw dog, come on.
-(applause)

08:00.217 --> 08:03.186
Oh, we got some hoes in
the audience tonight. Nice.

08:03.255 --> 08:04.554
(cheering)

08:04.623 --> 08:06.754
-Yeah.
-(cheering continues)

08:06.823 --> 08:11.293
Alright, relax, you
thirsty-ass bitches. God damn.

08:11.362 --> 08:14.629
Uh, and I-- you know what I miss
about the before times, though,

08:14.698 --> 08:16.665
-is going out dancing.
-(sad groans)

08:16.734 --> 08:18.266
That's-- All the girls got sad.

08:18.335 --> 08:20.135
-(laughter)
-I know! I miss it!

08:20.204 --> 08:22.470
I miss going out dancing.
I used to go every week.

08:22.539 --> 08:24.973
It was so fun,
and I miss going out dancing.

08:25.042 --> 08:28.075
Um, I-I-- My favorite is going
to gay clubs, right?

08:28.144 --> 08:31.379
I love going to gay clubs 'cause
gay men love straight women.
They love--

08:31.448 --> 08:33.015
You could walk in,
looking like shit.

08:33.084 --> 08:35.550
-I've done it before.
-(laughter)

08:35.619 --> 08:37.086
And one time--
It's a safe space, right?

08:37.155 --> 08:38.786
They're not gon--
They're not there
to bug you, right?

08:38.855 --> 08:40.923
You can just do whatever.
You can smell however you want.

08:40.992 --> 08:41.957
No one cares.

08:42.026 --> 08:43.558
I one time walked
into a gay club,

08:43.627 --> 08:45.693
looking like straight-up shit
head-to-toe,

08:45.762 --> 08:47.662
and as soon as I walked in,
this little queen was like,

08:47.731 --> 08:50.666
"Yes, girl!
You serving hobo realness!"

08:50.735 --> 08:53.468
-(applause)
-(laughs)

08:53.537 --> 08:56.972
I was like, "Thank you!
Thank you."

08:57.041 --> 08:58.534
But I hate going
to straight clubs

08:58.603 --> 09:01.876
'cause, men, y'all have lost
your sense of decorum.

09:01.945 --> 09:04.180
Motherfuckers went from,
"May I have this dance," to...

09:04.249 --> 09:05.809
(grunting)

09:05.878 --> 09:07.082
(laughter)

09:07.151 --> 09:09.651
(grunting)

09:09.720 --> 09:12.087
Just shit-faced drunk,
just thrusting their genitals.

09:12.156 --> 09:15.023
-They're doing (blubbering).
-(laughter)

09:15.092 --> 09:17.287
You're just minding
your business with your girl,

09:17.356 --> 09:18.693
doing the little
junior high circle,

09:18.762 --> 09:21.996
-minding your business, right?
-(laughter)

09:22.065 --> 09:24.533
And they just, (grunting)--
"Oh, my God! Is that a mosquito?

09:24.602 --> 09:27.368
-Ah!"
-(applause)

09:27.437 --> 09:29.637
And straight dudes
are tenacious.

09:29.706 --> 09:31.673
It's a numbers game for
straight men. They're like,

09:31.742 --> 09:33.441
"Oh my bad, my bad."
And they just move on.

09:33.510 --> 09:36.916
-(blubbering)
-(laughter)

09:37.782 --> 09:39.381
"Oh, no, my bad,
my bad, my bad."

09:39.450 --> 09:41.483
-(grunting)
-(laughter)

09:41.552 --> 09:42.988
(blubbering)

09:45.256 --> 09:47.222
And then when you try to be
like, "Oh, no, thank you,"

09:47.291 --> 09:48.690
they're just, they just...

09:48.759 --> 09:50.058
"Hey, you don't have
to play hard to get."

09:50.127 --> 09:52.295
Sir, you're playing
hard to get away from!

09:52.364 --> 09:53.628
(applause)

09:53.697 --> 09:57.467
Leave me alone.
No means no, Bill Cosby. Um...

09:57.536 --> 10:00.135
(shocked groans)

10:00.204 --> 10:02.438
If that's what you're
offended by, just buckle up.

10:02.507 --> 10:03.939
(laughter)

10:04.008 --> 10:07.409
I got some shit in
the second half. Alright, um...

10:07.478 --> 10:09.711
But I do.
I miss going out dancing.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.213
I, uh... (laughs)

10:11.282 --> 10:13.882
I one time had a guy
approach me at the bar.

10:13.951 --> 10:17.152
He comes right up to me.
He's like,
"I been watchin' you."

10:17.221 --> 10:19.658
Which is a bad start,
right, ladies?

10:20.325 --> 10:22.691
Creepy as fuck.

10:22.760 --> 10:25.527
He's like, "You're very tall."

10:25.596 --> 10:28.964
I was like, cool, he has
eyeballs? I don't...

10:29.033 --> 10:31.166
He's like, "You don't move
like a tall person."

10:31.235 --> 10:33.501
-What the fuck does that mean?
-(laughter)

10:33.570 --> 10:34.970
Does he expect me
to walk in the room

10:35.039 --> 10:36.939
and just start dunking on fools?

10:37.008 --> 10:38.907
(laughter)

10:38.976 --> 10:41.410
Soon as I walk in, every room
I walk into, I'm like,

10:41.479 --> 10:43.546
"Hey, guys,
I'm here from downtown!"

10:43.615 --> 10:46.114
(applause)

10:46.183 --> 10:48.984
"What's up, y'all?
Boom-shakalaka!

10:49.053 --> 10:53.088
She's on fire!" I don't know
what I'm doing wrong.

10:53.157 --> 10:55.924
I once had a guy roll up on me.
Literally. He's in a wheelchair.

10:55.993 --> 10:58.493
-He rolls up.
-(laughter)

10:58.562 --> 11:00.863
I'm so excited.
I don't have a type.

11:00.932 --> 11:02.665
I really don't.
Short, tall, fat, skinny.

11:02.734 --> 11:03.865
I don't give a fuck.
You got a dick?

11:03.934 --> 11:05.501
I wanna see it,
I wanna smell it.

11:05.570 --> 11:08.807
(applause)

11:09.674 --> 11:11.241
I'm like a curious puppy.

11:11.310 --> 11:14.213
(rapid sniffing)

11:17.915 --> 11:21.116
So this fool rolls up.
I'm excited. He goes like this.

11:21.185 --> 11:23.318
I love confidence in a man.
When he goes like this,

11:23.387 --> 11:24.948
I'm like, oh, what's up?

11:25.017 --> 11:26.391
(laughter)

11:27.391 --> 11:28.623
And he says, and I quote,

11:28.692 --> 11:32.161
"You would be perfect
if you had a fat ass."

11:32.230 --> 11:33.996
(audience gasps)

11:34.065 --> 11:36.465
I was like,
"You don't have legs."

11:36.534 --> 11:39.134
(laughter)

11:39.203 --> 11:42.637
(applause)

11:42.706 --> 11:44.039
And I wasn't even
gonna bring it up!

11:44.108 --> 11:46.441
I had no problem
with this shit, right?

11:46.510 --> 11:48.477
I'm glad you guys
enjoyed that.

11:48.546 --> 11:50.045
(laughter)

11:50.114 --> 11:51.881
For anybody at home
who's watching

11:51.950 --> 11:53.543
and is uptight about it,
just so you know,

11:53.612 --> 11:56.151
I'm not the bad guy
in that story, okay?

11:56.220 --> 11:59.621
MLK taught me to judge people by
the content of their character.

11:59.690 --> 12:03.258
-That dude was a dick, right?
-(applause)

12:03.327 --> 12:05.160
Because think about it.
He could have been clever

12:05.229 --> 12:07.262
with this shit,
but he chose to neg me.

12:07.331 --> 12:08.697
I hate when men neg.

12:08.766 --> 12:10.132
For-- Young women,
do not fall for negging.

12:10.201 --> 12:13.301
Negging is when a man includes
a insult in his compliment.

12:13.370 --> 12:15.737
That's not a compliment.
Just say I'm perfect.

12:15.806 --> 12:17.472
We both know that's not true.
Who gives a fuck?

12:17.541 --> 12:18.908
Are you trying to fuck or not?

12:18.977 --> 12:21.813
(applause, laughter)

12:22.447 --> 12:23.639
Right?

12:23.708 --> 12:25.647
And he could have been clever
with this shit.

12:25.716 --> 12:27.615
He could've fucking rolled up,
did this,

12:27.684 --> 12:29.885
I would've been like,
"What's up?"
He could've been like,

12:29.954 --> 12:32.120
"You ain't got no ass.
I ain't got no legs.

12:32.189 --> 12:34.155
Together,
we make a whole person."

12:34.224 --> 12:36.219
-(cheering)
-I'd have been like,

12:36.288 --> 12:38.261
"Oh, shit, let's go!"

12:38.330 --> 12:41.366
(applause)

12:44.468 --> 12:47.663
-Your guys' clapping
is stressing me out. Um...
-(laughter)

12:47.732 --> 12:51.206
I don't like it.
You guys are too lit right now!

12:51.275 --> 12:53.773
I'm good, huh?
That's the problem. Um.

12:54.646 --> 12:56.479
(laughing)

12:56.548 --> 12:58.013
(applause)

12:58.082 --> 13:00.049
They got it. They heard it.

13:00.118 --> 13:01.616
But ever since
I was a little girl,

13:01.685 --> 13:03.585
I always wanted a man
to approach me

13:03.654 --> 13:07.388
the way Michael Jackson used
to approach women in his videos.

13:07.457 --> 13:09.892
That's all I ever wanted.
Ever since I was a little girl,

13:09.961 --> 13:12.064
I just wanted a guy
to be all like--

13:12.697 --> 13:15.935
(laughter)

13:19.904 --> 13:23.639
"What's your name?
(imitating Michael Jackson)

13:23.708 --> 13:26.274
(laughter)

13:26.343 --> 13:27.109
(sings high note)

13:27.178 --> 13:30.415
(imitating Michael Jackson)

13:33.251 --> 13:35.587
(laughter)

13:36.754 --> 13:39.992
(applause)

13:43.461 --> 13:44.727
"Can I buy you a drink?

13:44.796 --> 13:46.328
(laughter)

13:46.397 --> 13:49.565
Vodka tonic? Be right back."
Just moonwalks.

13:49.634 --> 13:51.734
(laughter, applause)

13:51.803 --> 13:53.438
Into my heart. Okay.

13:55.306 --> 13:56.341
(laughs)

13:57.742 --> 13:59.011
(laughs)

14:00.712 --> 14:02.878
This is too much. Um...

14:02.947 --> 14:05.381
Anybody drunk?
I'm fuckin' lit,
bitch, right up.

14:05.450 --> 14:08.184
(cheering)

14:08.253 --> 14:09.150
(sighs)

14:09.219 --> 14:11.120
But here's the thing.
I realized

14:11.189 --> 14:13.588
that I don't want
all that shit, right?

14:13.657 --> 14:16.125
I was like, I don't--
I miss going out dancing,

14:16.194 --> 14:19.394
but I don't-- I don't miss
these dudes, right?

14:19.463 --> 14:22.197
And I was like,
I need to work on myself.

14:22.266 --> 14:24.500
Because the truth is I'm 37,

14:24.569 --> 14:26.134
and I've been single

14:26.203 --> 14:28.704
-all those 37 years.
-(laughter)

14:28.773 --> 14:31.073
And during the pandemic,
I was like,

14:31.142 --> 14:32.741
"Oh, shit, it's me."

14:32.810 --> 14:34.776
(laughter)

14:34.845 --> 14:36.078
It's me. I'm the problem.
And, bitch,

14:36.147 --> 14:39.281
if you're not laughing,
girl, it's you.

14:39.350 --> 14:41.617
You need to work on yourself.
You need to do some
self-reflecting--

14:41.686 --> 14:44.853
-Don't point at her!
-(laughter)

14:44.922 --> 14:46.558
Oh, it's you. (laughs)

14:47.625 --> 14:49.759
And she said, "It's us."

14:49.828 --> 14:51.594
It's her and I.

14:51.663 --> 14:53.396
We, too, are the problem.

14:53.465 --> 14:54.964
(laughter)

14:55.033 --> 14:57.633
That goofy-ass outfit,
of course, you're single. Um...

14:57.702 --> 15:00.469
Audience:
Oh!

15:00.538 --> 15:03.175
(applause)

15:04.809 --> 15:07.609
Me deflecting your kisses.
Ah! Ah!

15:07.678 --> 15:09.912
Uh, and I realized I need
to work on myself, right?

15:09.981 --> 15:12.280
I was like, bitch,
it's time to grow up, right?

15:12.349 --> 15:14.883
And then I started thinking
about shit, how I am.

15:14.952 --> 15:17.319
I had an epiphany
when I was watching

15:17.388 --> 15:19.120
"Beauty and the Beast"
with my niece.

15:19.189 --> 15:20.621
Okay, it's her favorite movie.

15:20.690 --> 15:23.025
Of course, I grew up
in the '90s, right?
I love that movie.

15:23.094 --> 15:26.327
So we're watching it,
and we get to that scene where,

15:26.396 --> 15:28.363
you know,
Belle has that realization,

15:28.432 --> 15:30.665
and the snowball fight scene,
you know what I'm talking about?

15:30.734 --> 15:33.068
Where she starts, like,
looking at him different.

15:33.137 --> 15:34.937
(scattered laughter)

15:35.006 --> 15:36.171
She starts realizing shit,

15:36.240 --> 15:39.509
I was like, I start
realizing shit, you know?

15:39.578 --> 15:42.614
-I mean...
-(laughter)

15:43.581 --> 15:45.881
I'm coarse.

15:45.950 --> 15:47.750
I'm unrefined. I'm the Beast!

15:47.819 --> 15:50.055
-No!
-(laughter)

15:51.221 --> 15:53.154
And I was like,
let me chill out.

15:53.223 --> 15:55.490
We kept watching
the movie, right?

15:55.559 --> 15:57.058
As we watched the movie,
I was like, oh!

15:57.127 --> 16:00.128
-I, too, slurp my oatmeal.
-(laughter)

16:00.197 --> 16:03.598
I also look good in a--
in a blue suit.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.700
I'm the Beast, right?
So I accepted that. I was like,

16:05.769 --> 16:07.698
that's who I am. I'm the Beast.
The next time I fucked a dude,

16:07.767 --> 16:09.939
I was like,
"Yeah, kill the Beast!"

16:10.008 --> 16:13.108
Psht! Kill the Beast.
Psht! Be my guest.

16:13.177 --> 16:16.412
Psht! Put this pussy.
Psht! To the test.

16:16.481 --> 16:17.549
Psht! Okay.

16:18.744 --> 16:21.249
-(laughter continues)
-(laughs)

16:21.318 --> 16:23.553
That was for all
the Disney heads,
you know what I'm sayin'?

16:23.622 --> 16:25.190
(humming) Okay.

16:26.523 --> 16:28.423
So, I was like,
I gotta work on myself.

16:28.492 --> 16:30.825
And it's hard because,
you know, I--

16:30.894 --> 16:35.063
You know, I have, obviously,
a great sense of humor, right?

16:35.132 --> 16:36.264
And men, on the dating profiles,

16:36.333 --> 16:37.565
they always say
they want a woman

16:37.634 --> 16:39.400
with a good sense of humor.
They always say that.

16:39.469 --> 16:41.136
"I want a woman--"
But they don't!

16:41.205 --> 16:42.971
Because when men say
they want a woman

16:43.040 --> 16:44.372
with a good sense of humor,
what they mean

16:44.441 --> 16:46.207
is they want a chick
whose boobs bounce

16:46.276 --> 16:48.478
when she laughs at his jokes.

16:48.547 --> 16:50.245
(laughter, applause)

16:50.314 --> 16:52.514
You see how the men
aren't clapping?

16:52.583 --> 16:54.716
The women are clapping
but the men aren't, okay?

16:54.785 --> 16:57.553
Because that's true.
They're like, "What?
No, come on."

16:57.622 --> 17:00.389
(laughter)

17:00.458 --> 17:02.524
So I was trying to watch-- I've
been trying to watch myself.

17:02.593 --> 17:05.556
I was looking at the last dude
that I was, I was talking to.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.462
I was like, what happened?

17:07.531 --> 17:09.634
And then, I looked at
our old text messages.

17:11.202 --> 17:14.439
This dude goes, "Marcella,
you have a beautiful face."

17:15.907 --> 17:17.472
And my response was,

17:17.541 --> 17:19.908
"I look like my dad.
Are you gay?"

17:19.977 --> 17:22.143
(laughter)

17:22.212 --> 17:24.580
No wonder it didn't work out.

17:24.649 --> 17:26.949
Gee whiz, right?

17:27.018 --> 17:28.383
So, I've been working
on myself, right?

17:28.452 --> 17:30.189
I'm trying to watch
my mouth a little bit.

17:31.789 --> 17:32.855
I'm dating a short guy right now

17:32.924 --> 17:34.423
because I don't have
a choice, right?

17:34.492 --> 17:35.523
(laughter)

17:35.592 --> 17:38.493
He's always asking me
for piggyback rides.

17:38.562 --> 17:41.700
Every time he hugs me, it looks
like a koala bear on a tree.

17:43.233 --> 17:45.433
It's all good.
I like how you guys are like,

17:45.502 --> 17:48.536
-"Come on, give him a chance."
-(laughter)

17:48.605 --> 17:50.072
I did give him a chance.
It's going on for a--

17:50.141 --> 17:51.506
It's been going on
for a minute now,

17:51.575 --> 17:54.877
-and we are in love,
okay? Yes!
-(cheering)

17:54.946 --> 17:56.778
I am in love!

17:56.847 --> 17:59.514
For the first time in my life--
No, wait, let me correct that.

17:59.583 --> 18:02.752
This is the first time
in my life someone
loves me back.

18:02.821 --> 18:04.586
Audience:
Aw...

18:04.655 --> 18:07.655
You see, the girls are like,
"Ooh, I feel that."

18:07.724 --> 18:10.162
You felt that right here,
bitch, huh?

18:10.895 --> 18:13.361
(laughs)

18:13.430 --> 18:15.898
And it's been great.
I'm-- I am enjoying it, but I--

18:15.967 --> 18:17.466
So I'm trying to like
watch my mouth.

18:17.535 --> 18:19.902
Not-- You know,
not when it counts,
but you know what I mean?

18:19.971 --> 18:21.336
(laughter)

18:21.405 --> 18:23.138
Like trying to watch what
I say out of my mouth,

18:23.207 --> 18:24.707
now what goes into it, right?

18:24.776 --> 18:26.374
(laughter)

18:26.443 --> 18:28.911
And so,
and the first time we had sex,

18:28.980 --> 18:30.713
I was trying to be mindful,

18:30.782 --> 18:32.384
and I took off my shirt.

18:33.050 --> 18:34.378
And he--

18:34.447 --> 18:36.652
(laughter)

18:36.721 --> 18:39.154
Bitch, I-- Was that you?

18:39.223 --> 18:41.824
She went, "Okay."

18:41.893 --> 18:43.659
-She taking notes!
-(laughter)

18:43.728 --> 18:44.988
She's like, "Okay."

18:45.057 --> 18:47.630
Are you a bitch, too?
Is that the problem?

18:47.699 --> 18:49.031
Are you trying
to work on yourself

18:49.100 --> 18:50.369
because you're a bitch, too?

18:51.702 --> 18:54.303
-You're fucking sliding
into your chair.
-(laughter)

18:54.372 --> 18:56.066
What happened?
Let's talk about it.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.901
What's wrong with you, girl?
No, just kidding.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.642
You're a bitch.
That's what it is. Okay.

18:59.711 --> 19:01.476
(laughter)

19:01.545 --> 19:03.845
So, the first time we're having
sex, I take off my shirt,

19:03.914 --> 19:08.050
and he was like, "Marcella,
you have incredible breasts."

19:08.119 --> 19:10.753
-It took all of me...
-(quiet laughter)

19:10.822 --> 19:12.353
not to say...

19:12.422 --> 19:14.722
-"You, too."
-(loud laughter)

19:14.791 --> 19:18.230
-He doesn't need
to hear that shit!
-(applause)

19:18.796 --> 19:20.399
He knows.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.101
So, I'm trying to watch my mouth
with this dude. He's great.

19:26.170 --> 19:29.471
Yeah, he's great. I love him.
We're a very progressive couple.

19:29.540 --> 19:32.908
Yeah, he's pansexual,
and I am also a hoe. Um...

19:32.977 --> 19:35.543
(laughter, applause)

19:35.612 --> 19:37.416
-Audience member: Woo!
-(laughs)

19:38.750 --> 19:40.181
That's funny you wooed
at that, sir,

19:40.250 --> 19:41.250
because I've been watching you,

19:41.319 --> 19:43.384
and you've been
hesitating to laugh.

19:43.453 --> 19:45.086
And then you wooed
that pansexual shit

19:45.155 --> 19:48.423
-because you love to suck
a dick and eat a pussy!
-(cheering)

19:48.492 --> 19:52.695
And! And eat a pussy! I love it!

19:52.764 --> 19:55.531
(imitates airhorn)
Shout out to you.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.731
(applause)

19:56.800 --> 19:59.404
Suck a dick and eat a pussy.
I love it. Okay!

20:00.871 --> 20:02.407
Reset! Okay.

20:03.775 --> 20:05.810
(sighs, laughs)

20:06.945 --> 20:08.944
(cheering, applause)

20:09.013 --> 20:11.984
No! No excessive clapping.
I don't have time for it.

20:13.084 --> 20:15.883
I gotta focus.

20:15.952 --> 20:18.420
That's your laugh?
That's a good-- Uh! I just--
I'm too--

20:18.489 --> 20:20.956
I have too much ADHD.
When I hear shit, I'm like...

20:21.025 --> 20:22.157
(growls)

20:22.226 --> 20:23.458
Come watch me
live another time

20:23.527 --> 20:25.894
so I can make fun
of your laugh! Okay.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.663
Focus. Focus.
Let me get back on track. Okay.

20:28.732 --> 20:31.834
Okay, so we've been going
for a few months now.

20:31.903 --> 20:33.869
Eight-- Eight months,
something like that.

20:33.938 --> 20:35.437
But, like three months into it,

20:35.506 --> 20:37.305
I told my homegirl--
You know, I was all excited.

20:37.374 --> 20:39.641
I was telling my closest
homegirls about it,

20:39.710 --> 20:42.443
and one of my homegirls
who's known me for a long time,
she was like,

20:42.512 --> 20:44.279
"Marcella, you need
move in with him!"

20:44.348 --> 20:46.648
And I was like, "Whoa!

20:46.717 --> 20:48.083
Relax."

20:48.152 --> 20:50.352
You know, like,
I'm trying to go slow.

20:50.421 --> 20:51.653
And she was like, "Marcella,

20:51.722 --> 20:53.555
"I just know you've dealt
with so many fuck-boys,

20:53.624 --> 20:55.391
and you're not getting
any younger." And I was like,

20:55.460 --> 20:57.025
"Okay, relax again."

20:57.094 --> 20:58.627
(laughter)

20:58.696 --> 20:59.990
-I'm not...
-Member: Going too far.

21:00.059 --> 21:03.165
-Yeah, going too far!
-(laughter)

21:03.234 --> 21:04.366
And I just went,
"You know what, girl?

21:04.435 --> 21:06.634
I'm just not trying
to ruin things, right?"

21:06.703 --> 21:08.164
And she goes,
"Don't worry, Marcella.

21:08.233 --> 21:11.206
It'll get ruined
because everything gets ruined."

21:11.275 --> 21:12.907
(groaning laughter)

21:12.976 --> 21:15.978
I was like,
"Damn, you're single?
Who would've guessed?"

21:16.047 --> 21:17.312
(laughter)

21:17.381 --> 21:19.048
Who the fuck says that shit,
right? I was like,

21:19.117 --> 21:20.916
"You know what?
I got somebody
I want you to meet."

21:20.985 --> 21:21.984
She was like, "Really? Who?"

21:22.053 --> 21:23.985
I was like, "My therapist,
you fuckin' bitch."

21:24.054 --> 21:25.187
Who--

21:25.256 --> 21:27.856
Who says that to someone
who's newly in love?

21:27.925 --> 21:30.493
(applause)

21:30.562 --> 21:31.627
But it's hard, right?

21:31.696 --> 21:33.562
To try to change
and to focus on it

21:33.631 --> 21:36.331
because then you also start
to internalize your fuck-ups.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.633
Right? You feel terrible.

21:38.702 --> 21:41.936
I once was going
to my homegirl's house.

21:42.005 --> 21:43.972
I shouldn't say homegirl 'cause
we're not super good friends.

21:44.041 --> 21:46.508
My friend Teresa,
she's a beautiful Asian girl,

21:46.577 --> 21:49.410
right? And, like,
we've kicked it before,

21:49.479 --> 21:52.614
so I know what she looks like.

21:52.683 --> 21:55.385
But then, I'm walking up
to her house,

21:55.454 --> 21:58.153
and I see her,

21:58.222 --> 22:01.456
and I'm about to be like,
"Hey, girl! What's up?" Right?

22:01.525 --> 22:04.793
And I'm right here.
I'm right at, "He..."

22:04.862 --> 22:06.028
(laughter)

22:06.097 --> 22:07.662
I'm like... (squeaks)

22:07.731 --> 22:11.633
And I realize that
she's not looking at me

22:11.702 --> 22:14.370
with the same familiar eyes...

22:14.439 --> 22:16.404
that I'm looking at her.

22:16.473 --> 22:19.308
And I was like, "He-- Oh...

22:19.377 --> 22:22.677
-"I'm a racist. Oh, my God."
-(laughter)

22:22.746 --> 22:25.681
"I think all Asians
look alike. Sandra Oh no."

22:25.750 --> 22:27.582
(laughter)

22:27.651 --> 22:30.152
"I'm a racist. Oh, my-- I think
all Asians look like this--

22:30.221 --> 22:31.954
Oh my-- This is terrible."

22:32.023 --> 22:33.689
I'm str-- I have all these
intrusive thoughts,

22:33.758 --> 22:35.891
and as I'm having
these thoughts,

22:35.960 --> 22:37.325
the girl, she looks at me,
she's like,

22:37.394 --> 22:39.260
"Are you Marcella?
I'm Teresa's twin sister."

22:39.329 --> 22:41.297
-I was like, twins!
-(laughter)

22:41.366 --> 22:45.133
(applause)

22:45.202 --> 22:47.439
That's a racist's
worst nightmare!

22:48.805 --> 22:51.043
You gotta let a bitch know
when you're twins.

22:53.444 --> 22:56.078
It's hard trying to be
a better person.

22:56.147 --> 22:57.813
But here's what I do like.

22:57.882 --> 23:00.315
I do like the music
on the radio right now

23:00.384 --> 23:02.852
with all the rap girlies.
I love it.

23:02.921 --> 23:06.321
Megan, Cardi, Doja,
Saweetie, the City Girls.

23:06.390 --> 23:08.758
I love all of it.
Latto, I love all of it.

23:08.827 --> 23:10.691
I'm so happy these girls
are on the radio,

23:10.760 --> 23:13.695
and they're-- but they're always
rapping about broke dudes

23:13.764 --> 23:16.331
or shitting on broke dudes,
right? Cardi had that one song.

23:16.400 --> 23:19.634
-"Broke boys don't
deserve no pussy."
-Audience: I know that's right!

23:19.703 --> 23:22.833
-Brainwashed.
You see these bitches?
-(laughter)

23:22.902 --> 23:24.573
Fucking brainwashed.

23:24.642 --> 23:25.874
That shit ain't right.

23:25.943 --> 23:28.743
That's classism, girl!
That's elitism!

23:28.812 --> 23:30.578
And here's the fucked-up part.
They never tell you

23:30.647 --> 23:33.052
why you shouldn't
fuck a broke dude.

23:34.751 --> 23:36.919
Does anybody know why you
shouldn't fuck a broke dude?

23:36.988 --> 23:38.987
(indistinct suggestions)

23:39.056 --> 23:41.022
They got the best dick.

23:41.091 --> 23:42.958
(cheers, laughter)

23:43.027 --> 23:44.960
They got the--
Broke dudes got the best dick.

23:45.029 --> 23:47.163
That's facts.
I've done the research.

23:47.232 --> 23:50.800
(laughter)

23:50.869 --> 23:52.034
And why do they have
the best dick?

23:52.103 --> 23:54.403
Because they've been
sleeping all day...

23:54.472 --> 23:55.905
(laughter)

23:55.974 --> 23:59.174
then they fuck
the shit out of you!

23:59.243 --> 24:02.578
And your stupid young ass
is like, "There was a spark."

24:02.647 --> 24:04.679
-(laughter)
-(sighs)

24:04.748 --> 24:07.282
Like, that wasn't a spark, girl.
He's just well-rested.

24:07.351 --> 24:09.150
-(laughter)
-Right?

24:09.219 --> 24:11.887
"Like, you don't understand.
We had romantic shower sex."

24:11.956 --> 24:14.357
Bitch, he needed
to take a shower.

24:14.426 --> 24:16.291
(laughter)

24:16.360 --> 24:17.727
"Marcella,
you don't understand.

24:17.796 --> 24:18.928
In the morning,
he made me coffee."

24:18.997 --> 24:21.864
Girl, he is
a 46-year-old barista.

24:21.933 --> 24:23.568
(laughter)

24:24.169 --> 24:25.534
(laughs)

24:25.603 --> 24:27.335
Look, I'm not saying
don't fuck them.

24:27.404 --> 24:31.072
Just don't fall for them.
That's what I'm saying, right?

24:31.141 --> 24:33.375
'Cause they either
fuck you right
or they pay all your bills.

24:33.444 --> 24:35.378
-It's never both.
-(laughter)

24:35.447 --> 24:37.680
Because if it's both...

24:37.749 --> 24:40.585
-he's cheating on you.
-(laughter)

24:42.652 --> 24:44.653
Yeah, but I've been
trying to grow up,

24:44.722 --> 24:46.989
get better,
be a better person.

24:47.058 --> 24:48.351
And, uh, it's hard.

24:48.420 --> 24:49.958
But I always think about
how I was as a kid.

24:50.027 --> 24:51.894
You guys remember
the DARE program?

24:51.963 --> 24:53.523
Guys, remember the DARE program?
Oh, my God.

24:53.592 --> 24:55.430
I love the DARE program.
For those that don't remember,

24:55.499 --> 24:57.332
the DARE program
was a program,

24:57.401 --> 25:00.602
an abstinence--
an abstinence-only...

25:00.671 --> 25:04.106
Wait. A drug and alcohol
resistance program.

25:04.175 --> 25:06.845
Right? Just taught you
to say no. That's all it was.

25:07.545 --> 25:09.878
And I fucking loved it.

25:09.947 --> 25:13.181
I-- When I was a kid,
I loved being good.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.384
I love getting straight A's.
I loved being a snitch.

25:16.453 --> 25:18.587
-I loved it.
-(laughter)

25:18.656 --> 25:21.689
My siblings fuckin' hated me.

25:21.758 --> 25:24.059
I was like, "Listen,
I'm not here to make friends."

25:24.128 --> 25:25.094
(laughter)

25:25.163 --> 25:28.000
"They feed me
and buy me toys! Come on!"

25:29.500 --> 25:32.200
And I loved the DARE program.
It was built for me. I loved it.

25:32.269 --> 25:35.170
And I loved, "Say no to drugs."
I loved being good.

25:35.239 --> 25:38.040
And, uh, I actually...

25:38.109 --> 25:39.841
(laughs) I don't know
if you remember,

25:39.910 --> 25:42.444
at the end of the DARE program,
you wrote an essay

25:42.513 --> 25:45.108
about why you love
the DARE program.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.147
Girl, my essay was so good,

25:46.216 --> 25:48.984
I got to read it
in front of the whole school.

25:49.053 --> 25:49.952
(laughter)

25:50.021 --> 25:52.888
Yeah. That's how good
it was, okay?

25:52.957 --> 25:54.890
I was so proud.
My mom was so proud.

25:54.959 --> 25:57.659
My mom was so proud of me,
she framed it

25:57.728 --> 26:00.162
and had it hanging
by the front door.

26:00.231 --> 26:02.231
Right, but, yeah. Adorable.
Yeah. You leave the house,

26:02.300 --> 26:04.567
and it was right there.
Every time I left, I was like,

26:04.636 --> 26:05.934
-"Mm..."
-(laughter)

26:06.003 --> 26:07.335
And then I think back, I'm like,

26:07.404 --> 26:08.704
no wonder my siblings hated me.

26:08.773 --> 26:10.205
You know, like, how annoying.

26:10.274 --> 26:11.841
But whatever,
you know?

26:11.910 --> 26:14.276
I was proud of myself.
I loved it.

26:14.345 --> 26:15.915
And then, I grew up.

26:17.381 --> 26:20.710
I started drinking at 21,
which is good. That's good.

26:20.779 --> 26:23.646
-I started smoking weed
around 24, right?
-(lone laugh)

26:23.715 --> 26:26.189
And-- I don't like the way
you laughed at that, ma'am.

26:26.258 --> 26:28.424
(laughter)

26:28.493 --> 26:30.125
Damn... Your laughter,

26:30.194 --> 26:32.160
you just called me a virgin
with that laughter.

26:32.229 --> 26:33.765
I don't like that.

26:34.599 --> 26:36.498
And so,

26:36.567 --> 26:38.100
uh, the first time I got high,

26:38.169 --> 26:41.103
I went back to my mother's
house, my parents' house,

26:41.172 --> 26:42.938
and I was high as shit,

26:43.007 --> 26:44.439
and I was trying to hide it.

26:44.508 --> 26:46.774
Like, looking down
and shit, you know.

26:46.843 --> 26:49.044
And parents, they--
if there's parents of kids here,

26:49.113 --> 26:51.213
you know. You know when
something is up with your kid.

26:51.282 --> 26:54.249
You know when they're happy,
sad, when something's up,

26:54.318 --> 26:55.317
when something's bothering them,

26:55.386 --> 26:57.385
when they wanna talk
about something, you know.

26:57.454 --> 27:00.889
So, my mom knew
since I walked in
that something was up, right?

27:00.958 --> 27:03.091
But she-- but I was looking all,
you know, I was, like,

27:03.160 --> 27:04.993
not trying to look at her.
And she-- she's 5'8",

27:05.062 --> 27:06.762
so she was trying
to get up under me. She's like,

27:06.831 --> 27:08.833
-qué te pasa , Marcella?
-(laughter)

27:10.168 --> 27:12.400
Qué te pasa, Marcella?
Qué te pasa?

27:12.469 --> 27:14.970
Ey, Marcella, qué te pasa?

27:15.039 --> 27:16.472
Marcella, qué te pasa,
Marcella?

27:16.541 --> 27:18.106
(clicking tongue)

27:18.175 --> 27:19.575
(laughter)

27:19.644 --> 27:20.913
Qué te pasa?

27:22.714 --> 27:23.979
And I don't lie.
I've never lied.

27:24.048 --> 27:26.682
I've always been a good kid,
so I don't lie.

27:26.751 --> 27:29.188
So, on her sixth qué te pasa,

27:30.421 --> 27:32.120
I told my mother,

27:32.189 --> 27:34.990
-"I am high on marijuana!"
-(laughter)

27:35.059 --> 27:38.297
That's how I said it.
"I am high on marijuana."

27:40.164 --> 27:43.198
And she was upset.
Yeah. And-and--

27:43.267 --> 27:45.600
You know, she got me in trouble.
I went to my room.

27:45.669 --> 27:47.002
And in the morning,
when I got up,

27:47.071 --> 27:49.304
I was too ashamed to, like, go--
like, go say good morning.

27:49.373 --> 27:50.873
None of that shit.
I didn't do none of that.

27:50.942 --> 27:52.407
I just, like,
snuck out of the house,

27:52.476 --> 27:54.877
and as I was sneaking out of
the house to get breakfast,

27:54.946 --> 27:57.680
I noticed that the essay...

27:57.749 --> 27:59.682
Audience:
Aw...

27:59.751 --> 28:01.987
...was taken down.
It was gone.

28:03.421 --> 28:06.354
You know, Latinos, we don't,
like, talk about our problems

28:06.423 --> 28:07.723
or what's bothering us.

28:07.792 --> 28:10.125
So I had never mentioned it.

28:10.194 --> 28:12.428
I was like,
"She-- she not wrong."

28:12.497 --> 28:14.166
(laughter)

28:15.467 --> 28:18.166
And then, a month ago,

28:18.235 --> 28:20.836
I heard her moving
something, like, in the back,

28:20.905 --> 28:23.205
and I hear something
fall and break.

28:23.274 --> 28:25.468
Like, something crashes.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.479
And I just hear,
"Oh, sorry, Marcella."

28:28.613 --> 28:29.879
And I was like, what?

28:29.948 --> 28:31.880
And it was the DARE essay.

28:31.949 --> 28:33.315
She had saved it.

28:33.384 --> 28:35.451
So I brought it here
to read to you guys.

28:35.520 --> 28:37.820
(applause)

28:37.889 --> 28:40.389
So... Look at that.

28:40.458 --> 28:43.195
(cheering)

28:44.829 --> 28:46.862
The stationery.
This is the original.

28:46.931 --> 28:49.431
The cardstock. It's legit.

28:49.500 --> 28:51.427
Okay.

28:51.496 --> 28:53.669
"I promise
to say no to drugs..."

28:53.738 --> 28:54.837
(laughter)

28:54.906 --> 28:57.406
"because of the everyday things
I wanna do.

28:57.475 --> 28:59.442
Breathe and stay alive."

28:59.511 --> 29:01.043
(laughter)

29:01.112 --> 29:04.213
"Drugs are something
I will never do.

29:04.282 --> 29:07.616
"Drugs aren't just
flashy things.
They are deadly things.

29:07.685 --> 29:09.051
"If you think drugs are cool

29:09.120 --> 29:11.687
"because famous people like
models and TV stars use them,

29:11.756 --> 29:13.449
you think wrong." All capital.

29:13.518 --> 29:15.691
-"You think wrong."
-(laughter)

29:15.760 --> 29:18.560
"I promise again
to say no to drugs.

29:18.629 --> 29:20.029
"The only way
I can keep my promise

29:20.098 --> 29:22.131
"is to pick good friends,
people I trust,

29:22.200 --> 29:24.132
"and great adults
that I can depend on.

29:24.201 --> 29:25.834
"If I didn't have
all those people,

29:25.903 --> 29:27.703
who knows where
I'd be right now?"

29:27.772 --> 29:29.305
I'm 10.

29:29.374 --> 29:31.572
(laughter)

29:31.641 --> 29:34.877
"The promise is very important
to keep because of cancer,

29:34.946 --> 29:36.712
-AIDS..."
-(audience groaning)

29:36.781 --> 29:39.515
It was the '90s.
"Cancer, AIDS,

29:39.584 --> 29:41.016
"and a lot of deadly things.

29:41.085 --> 29:43.919
"If everyone knew about this
and cared about themselves,

29:43.988 --> 29:46.755
"no one would be
buying drugs today.

29:46.824 --> 29:48.523
"My goals are never,
ever to use drugs,

29:48.592 --> 29:50.826
but that will be hard
because all of the pressure."

29:50.895 --> 29:52.160
(laughter)

29:52.229 --> 29:53.863
"My other goals
are to become a teacher

29:53.932 --> 29:56.226
and to have
a lovely drug-free family."

29:56.295 --> 29:57.660
Audience:
Aw...

29:57.729 --> 29:59.534
"The most fun thing
I did in DARE was acting

29:59.603 --> 30:01.871
"and learning all about drugs.
Marcella Arguello,

30:01.940 --> 30:04.439
Cypress School,
May 18, 1995."

30:04.508 --> 30:07.476
-(cheering)
-Thank you.

30:07.545 --> 30:10.406
(applause)

30:10.475 --> 30:12.384
So I wrote a little response.

30:13.450 --> 30:16.417
-"You dumb little bitch."
-(laughter)

30:16.486 --> 30:20.388
"You broke your promise
and your mother's heart.

30:20.457 --> 30:22.291
"First of all,
you really should take a break

30:22.360 --> 30:25.593
"from playing with your Barbies
and eating pupusas  and realize

30:25.662 --> 30:28.163
"that being an adult
is not easy.

30:28.232 --> 30:30.265
"One day, you will grow up
to love drugs

30:30.334 --> 30:32.468
because guess what?
Drugs are great."

30:32.537 --> 30:34.470
(laughter)

30:34.539 --> 30:36.171
"And life is hard.

30:36.240 --> 30:37.606
"Drugs can get you
through the day

30:37.675 --> 30:39.775
or help you sleep at night,
and they even clear your skin."

30:39.844 --> 30:41.877
-That's true.
-(laughter)

30:41.946 --> 30:44.312
"You said you would
keep your drug-free promise

30:44.381 --> 30:46.248
"by picking good friends,
people you trust,

30:46.317 --> 30:47.782
"and great adults
that you can depend on.

30:47.851 --> 30:50.152
"And I want you to know
that some of the best

30:50.221 --> 30:53.455
"and only people you should
do drugs with are good friends,

30:53.524 --> 30:56.892
people you trust, and great
adults that you can depend on."

30:56.961 --> 31:00.199
(applause, cheering)

31:02.633 --> 31:05.000
"Additionally, the DARE program
will end very soon

31:05.069 --> 31:07.170
because it's tremendously
ineffective."

31:07.239 --> 31:08.270
(laughter)

31:08.339 --> 31:11.473
"In fact, it will become
an anti-bullying program,

31:11.542 --> 31:15.177
"which you  could use.

31:15.246 --> 31:17.078
"You know,
some of those gay kids
are gonna grow up

31:17.147 --> 31:19.882
to be your best friend,
you homophobic twat."

31:19.951 --> 31:20.949
(laughter)

31:21.018 --> 31:23.318
Again, it was the '90s, okay?

31:23.387 --> 31:25.888
"Look, in 'Parable of the
Sower,' Octavia Butler writes,

31:25.957 --> 31:27.455
"'The only lasting truth
is change.'

31:27.524 --> 31:29.690
"So, little me,
it's time to start changing

31:29.759 --> 31:32.427
"because the sooner you focus
your energy on taking down

31:32.496 --> 31:34.296
"oppressive institutional
power structures

31:34.365 --> 31:35.965
"that brainwash you
into thinking

31:36.034 --> 31:37.900
"you're morally superior
than other people,

31:37.969 --> 31:40.569
the better off you'll be.
Yours forever, You."

31:40.638 --> 31:43.033
(cheering)

31:43.102 --> 31:45.474
My name is Marcella Arguello,
you guys. Thank you so much.

31:45.543 --> 31:46.709
Have a good night!

31:46.778 --> 31:50.015
(applause)

31:54.952 --> 31:58.190
(cheering, applause continue)
