WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:04.475
Ray has killed Dan Brown,
Curtis Cox and Michael Sharp.

00:04.555 --> 00:06.395
Sharp was killed for a reason.

00:06.475 --> 00:08.515
We were taken off the case
for the same reason.

00:08.595 --> 00:11.715
It makes no sense.
Bruv, we could have been killed.

00:11.795 --> 00:13.475
So why weren't we?

00:13.555 --> 00:15.595
What did Sharp have to say
that was so important?

00:15.675 --> 00:18.075
What do you think
"access denied" means?

00:18.155 --> 00:19.715
It means we're no longer on the
case.

00:19.795 --> 00:23.635
This stays low. No one else knows.
But we don't stop.

00:23.715 --> 00:26.315
Graham Borlock? I'm here to
ask you about Michael Sharp.

00:26.395 --> 00:28.075
I'm retired. Leave me alone.

00:28.155 --> 00:30.275
Bish, fancy a hot date?

00:32.115 --> 00:34.555
Are we cool? Yeah, we're cool.

00:34.635 --> 00:37.235
I'm taking the job. I'm out, bro.

00:37.315 --> 00:39.755
Undo it, man. No.

00:42.355 --> 00:44.192
You and Sharp was in
something together

00:44.205 --> 00:45.915
and I'm gonna find
out what you did.

00:45.995 --> 00:47.195
Then I'm coming for you.

00:49.115 --> 00:50.915
No!

00:50.995 --> 00:53.915
Dad, no! Dad!

00:54.995 --> 00:56.955
Armed Police. Get off the bike!

01:24.555 --> 01:26.395
All right?

01:33.835 --> 01:35.875
How's he doing? He's stable.

01:35.955 --> 01:39.475
But the blunt-force trauma
from a bullet ruptured his spleen.

01:39.555 --> 01:40.915
Big internal bleed.

01:41.955 --> 01:43.515
He was lucky.

01:43.595 --> 01:45.315
If it wasn't for the stab vest...

02:28.155 --> 02:30.555
You all right? Yeah. You OK?

02:33.195 --> 02:34.875
Thanks for staying with him.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.995
Anything I can do, Ronnie.
You know that.

02:37.755 --> 02:39.755
Any information on the gunman?

02:40.475 --> 02:42.675
That scum's gonna be in there
forever.

02:44.555 --> 02:47.235
Well, we'd better be getting back.

02:47.315 --> 02:49.835
Yeah. Sure.

02:49.915 --> 02:51.555
Sure.

02:51.635 --> 02:54.075
All right?
Yeah. I'll see you at home.

03:21.675 --> 03:23.995
Bish, man... You wanna talk?

03:24.075 --> 03:26.915
Yeah, we can talk about how to
find out who Ray's working for.

03:26.995 --> 03:29.515
Nah, nah, nah,
I'm talking about me and you - us.

03:31.035 --> 03:33.155
We can do that another day.
No, no. Bish...

03:33.235 --> 03:36.275
I'm sorry about the Bakur thing.
Yeah?

03:36.355 --> 03:39.115
I had mad pressure on me
and I made the wrong call.

03:40.395 --> 03:43.275
You know I don't like it
when we're not talking, man.

03:45.955 --> 03:48.795
Yeah, man. Thanks, man.
Hold on? Thanks?

03:49.715 --> 03:51.235
I just poured out my heart,

03:51.315 --> 03:53.755
you're walking away
and telling me thanks?

03:55.555 --> 03:58.515
Bruv, you know I don't have
anyone else except you.

03:59.675 --> 04:01.195
You know that.

04:03.155 --> 04:04.555
I know.

04:07.195 --> 04:10.235
And I... I wanna find out
who Ray's working for.

04:10.315 --> 04:12.395
Are you in?
Bruv, I was never out.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.235
We need to find out
who my dad was calling.

04:16.315 --> 04:18.834
Tanner's on it. Also,
there's someone you should meet.

04:18.915 --> 04:19.954
Who?

05:20.435 --> 05:22.795
You've got a fucking nerve.

05:28.555 --> 05:31.315
Desperate times...

05:32.515 --> 05:34.795
Desperate measures.

05:37.955 --> 05:40.515
Why don't you tell my man
what your name is?

05:40.595 --> 05:42.675
I'm Ronald Pike...

05:43.475 --> 05:45.195
..Junior.

05:46.835 --> 05:49.915
Now, you gave me a picture
of Sharp and his dad.

05:50.635 --> 05:54.635
He's now lying in a hospital bed,
eating his dinner through a straw.

05:54.715 --> 05:57.755
Yeah, I saw it on the news.
He's alive, then?

05:57.835 --> 05:59.555
Just.

05:59.635 --> 06:01.675
We can put you in Witness
Protection.

06:01.755 --> 06:03.275
Tell us the story.

06:03.355 --> 06:06.075
How you ended up here
in this fucking shit hole.

06:06.155 --> 06:07.675
Who are you scared of?

06:07.755 --> 06:09.475
Ah...

06:12.875 --> 06:14.195
Him, yeah?

06:15.675 --> 06:18.035
Yeah, we've got him in custody.

06:18.115 --> 06:19.715
Never seen him before.

06:19.795 --> 06:21.795
He killed Sharp.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.315
And he tried to kill my dad.

06:24.275 --> 06:25.675
I want to know why.

06:25.755 --> 06:29.275
And if we hadn't caught him,
you may have been next on his list.

06:29.355 --> 06:32.275
So... I'm not gonna ask you again.

06:35.835 --> 06:38.715
Sharp was part of
a cocaine smuggling ring...

06:39.435 --> 06:42.475
..and I ran the unit
that brought them down.

06:42.555 --> 06:45.555
But I could never put him away.
Every time, he walked.

06:46.475 --> 06:49.395
So I dug into him,
like any good copper would.

06:50.635 --> 06:53.675
And the further I dug...
the uglier it got.

06:54.515 --> 06:57.515
Turns out he was untouchable.

06:58.515 --> 07:01.075
When he was police,
he was part of an undercover unit.

07:02.315 --> 07:03.835
With your father.

07:03.915 --> 07:05.915
Doing what?

07:05.995 --> 07:09.755
They were set up to fight the war
against organised criminals...

07:09.835 --> 07:13.195
but ended up becoming
organised criminals themselves.

07:13.275 --> 07:15.915
You set out with good intentions.
These things always do.

07:15.995 --> 07:17.715
But money corrupts.

07:17.795 --> 07:20.595
Your father never mentioned
Black Heart to you?

07:21.167 --> 07:23.367
That was the name of the unit.

07:42.007 --> 07:44.447
So, apparently,
this little bitch used to be

07:44.527 --> 07:47.127
in the top five
of Europol's most wanted list.

07:48.167 --> 07:50.216
I guess your rep's
been knocked since

07:50.229 --> 07:52.127
I arrested your
pandemicking arse.

07:53.487 --> 07:55.927
But if Sharp and Director Pike
were contracts...

07:57.047 --> 07:58.527
..who hired you?

08:00.527 --> 08:02.207
I won't lie.

08:02.927 --> 08:06.247
I feel a little giddy...
sitting here with you two.

08:08.647 --> 08:10.407
I'm such a fan.

08:12.367 --> 08:13.927
That's why I spared you.

08:17.807 --> 08:19.618
I'll be real with you, man.
We're busy

08:19.631 --> 08:21.407
and you're not gonna
get out of this.

08:21.487 --> 08:24.087
So why don't you just tell us
who you work for?

08:25.087 --> 08:27.367
What about Black Heart?

08:27.447 --> 08:29.647
You heard that name before?

08:31.647 --> 08:33.407
Who hired you?

08:37.441 --> 08:42.601
In another life,
we three could be... partners.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.481
Partners?

08:45.561 --> 08:47.161
You wish!

08:48.481 --> 08:51.481
Well, are you gonna tell him,
or shall I?

08:54.681 --> 08:56.241
My old man...

08:57.001 --> 08:59.001
he's still alive.

09:20.481 --> 09:21.961
What you thinking?

09:22.752 --> 09:24.992
A man like Ray will be pissed off
he didn't finish the job.

09:25.072 --> 09:27.112
I mean, you look at him -

09:27.192 --> 09:29.392
his hair, his nails,
the way he grooms himself.

09:29.472 --> 09:31.232
He feels pride in everything he does.

09:31.832 --> 09:34.192
Fuck him. He don't feel nothing.

09:34.272 --> 09:36.112
Nah, he does.

09:36.192 --> 09:38.312
He does, man.
We all feel something.

09:38.392 --> 09:40.992
Let's take this to Tanner,
see what she says.

10:22.027 --> 10:25.307
Got the diagnostics back
on the phone your dad used.

10:25.387 --> 10:27.067
Dead end.

10:27.610 --> 10:29.250
How's your father doing, Pike?

10:30.810 --> 10:32.290
Since you asked...

10:41.930 --> 10:44.730
Found a retired officer
called Borlock.

10:45.610 --> 10:48.770
He arrested Sharp twice but could
never make the charges stick,

10:48.850 --> 10:50.603
so he did more
digging and realised

10:50.616 --> 10:52.330
that Sharp wasn't
just a criminal,

10:52.410 --> 10:53.810
he was a police officer.

10:53.890 --> 10:56.690
He was in an undercover unit
called Black Heart.

10:58.330 --> 11:00.650
And guess who else was in that unit?

11:00.730 --> 11:02.570
Pike Senior knew Sharp.

11:02.650 --> 11:04.930
They were working together.
Hang on.

11:05.010 --> 11:07.450
This Borlock.
I mean, do you trust him?

11:08.290 --> 11:10.650
Cos this is a fucking wild
conspiracy.

11:10.730 --> 11:12.890
Well, explain the photos, then.

11:17.250 --> 11:19.530
An undercover unit called
Black Heart?

11:19.610 --> 11:21.610
Doing... Doing what exactly?

11:22.330 --> 11:25.610
I don't know. It's clear
they didn't want it getting out.

11:25.690 --> 11:28.530
They hired Ray to clean up
anyone and anything to do with it.

11:29.850 --> 11:32.410
Fuck, I thought I'd seen it all.

11:33.290 --> 11:36.690
Well, I hate to be the one
who said I told you so, but...

11:37.650 --> 11:41.210
So why don't we find out who's been
trying to keep this all quiet?

11:44.490 --> 11:47.930
I know someone who worked with
your old man back in the day.

11:48.010 --> 11:49.970
I'll see if I can find him.

12:07.890 --> 12:10.490
Does that bug you?
Huh? That bug you?

12:14.930 --> 12:16.970
I need your phone.

12:17.730 --> 12:19.290
What phone?

12:48.770 --> 12:50.290
It's me.

13:07.030 --> 13:09.110
Hello. Nellios.

13:09.870 --> 13:10.990
Are you erm...

13:11.070 --> 13:13.150
What er... What you...

13:13.230 --> 13:16.150
Er... What you doing?

13:16.230 --> 13:21.670
Er... currently purchasing
some er... very high-end lingerie.

13:22.430 --> 13:25.030
Really?
No, you emotional juvenile.

13:25.110 --> 13:27.310
I'm just picking up bread and milk.

13:29.150 --> 13:33.670
Well, I'm just... calling, really,
to... to see how you're doing.

13:33.750 --> 13:36.710
I haven't seen you in a couple of
days, so I just thought I would

13:36.790 --> 13:39.990
call and check in...
see how you are.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.230
Good, yeah. It was good.

13:44.630 --> 13:45.910
Cool.

13:48.110 --> 13:49.590
Cool.

13:50.310 --> 13:53.270
It's funny that you mentioned the
lingerie.

13:53.350 --> 13:55.750
I know you're not buying it,
cos you said you're not,

13:55.830 --> 13:58.870
but if you were...
you know, I just wanted to...

13:58.950 --> 14:00.670
let you know that...

14:01.590 --> 14:03.790
..I liked the ones
you had on the other day.

14:03.870 --> 14:06.830
They were nice.
Oh, fuck off, Bish!

14:06.910 --> 14:08.350
Too soon for that sort of chat?

14:08.430 --> 14:10.350
Yeah, definitely too soon.

14:11.030 --> 14:12.550
I'll see you tomorrow, yeah?

14:13.830 --> 14:15.750
OK. See you tomorrow.

14:21.550 --> 14:23.550
I'm in with a chance.

14:42.990 --> 14:44.470
Just tell him I'll ring back.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.710
Hi, Charlotte.
Sorry if it's a bad time.

14:46.790 --> 14:49.430
Arjana, can I call you back?
I'm in the middle of something.

14:49.510 --> 14:52.030
Unless it's really important.
It's the development.

14:52.110 --> 14:54.430
There's a few things
I'm not entirely happy about,

14:54.510 --> 14:55.950
and I want to talk them through.

14:56.030 --> 14:58.030
Look, this has got to be signed off.

14:58.110 --> 15:00.790
All right? So just do what
you need to do and...

15:00.870 --> 15:02.190
I'm sorry, I've really got to go.

15:02.270 --> 15:05.230
Call me when it's been signed off.
OK? Thanks, bye.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.390
Sh...

15:14.310 --> 15:15.550
Oh!

15:30.830 --> 15:32.230
Ow, ow...

15:32.910 --> 15:35.270
Babe, dinner's ready.

15:35.350 --> 15:38.590
I know it just came out of a microwave
but I promise it's organic.

15:42.190 --> 15:43.830
Babe?

15:51.270 --> 15:53.270
Are you OK, baby?

15:56.550 --> 15:58.670
I've got to do something
that I don't want to do

15:58.750 --> 16:01.870
and I don't know if it's right to
do, but I know I have to do it.

16:03.110 --> 16:05.750
Does that make sense?
Absolutely not.

16:07.790 --> 16:11.350
I've found something out, and
whilst it's not strictly illegal,

16:11.430 --> 16:14.790
it... stinks and it's not right or
fair.

16:16.630 --> 16:19.270
Has this got something
to do with Charlotte?

16:20.950 --> 16:23.750
There are people
who will be unhappy with me.

16:29.190 --> 16:31.230
I've got to do something about it.

16:36.030 --> 16:38.950
I'm sure you'll make
the right decision.

16:39.710 --> 16:42.990
You always know right from wrong.
That's why I love you.

16:45.750 --> 16:47.750
You'll be fine.

16:48.630 --> 16:50.030
Yeah.

18:17.030 --> 18:18.750
Where would you know this guy from?

18:18.830 --> 18:20.790
He was my boss in Paddington.

18:20.870 --> 18:24.110
He's a complete arsehole.

18:53.710 --> 18:56.390
Do you know how
bodybuilders put on bulk?

19:01.670 --> 19:03.670
Muscular hypertrophy.

19:04.510 --> 19:07.950
You force it,
really get your pump on,

19:08.030 --> 19:12.870
and what that does is cause
microscopic damage to the muscle,

19:12.950 --> 19:16.590
which then repairs and gets larger.

19:18.510 --> 19:20.510
Not stronger.

19:21.190 --> 19:23.870
That's funny. They always say that.

19:24.670 --> 19:26.910
Until I fucking hit 'em.

19:31.470 --> 19:33.830
Fucking mug.
You might look big, but...

19:38.990 --> 19:41.470
..you're as much use
as a glass hammer.

19:41.550 --> 19:42.910
What?

19:46.670 --> 19:49.070
That all you got?

19:55.550 --> 19:59.990
You're a small fish
in a fucking big pond, you prick.

20:28.710 --> 20:30.590
Hello, Eddie.

20:31.910 --> 20:33.870
Well, Sarah Tanner.

20:33.950 --> 20:35.910
Looking good.
These are my colleagues.

20:35.990 --> 20:38.950
This is Aaron Bishop
and Ronnie Pike.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.590
Ronnie Pike?
They'd like to ask a few questions.

20:41.670 --> 20:44.150
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry
to hear about your dad.

20:44.230 --> 20:46.430
How is he doing? He'll live.

20:46.510 --> 20:48.070
What do you know about Black Heart?

20:51.070 --> 20:53.910
Not a lot. Long time ago.

20:59.190 --> 21:01.190
Was my dad part of the unit?

21:01.990 --> 21:03.870
Yeah.

21:03.950 --> 21:06.310
Yeah, he was.
They tried to recruit a few of us.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.150
What about Michael Sharp?

21:08.950 --> 21:10.510
We know he was a part of it.

21:10.590 --> 21:12.630
We just want to know
who'd want to kill him.

21:12.710 --> 21:16.190
Who else was involved?
You wanna know who'd want him dead?

21:16.270 --> 21:18.310
It's quite a long list.

21:18.390 --> 21:20.870
Who was in the unit?
There were six guys.

21:20.950 --> 21:22.390
There was your dad, Sharp,

21:22.470 --> 21:25.590
there was er... some older bloke,
a Glaswegian...

21:25.670 --> 21:28.070
Jeff Sterling, a bloke called Dodds.

21:28.150 --> 21:31.270
I don't know about the other two.
You absolutely sure about that?

21:31.350 --> 21:33.670
Yeah.
I never knew the other two names.

21:35.110 --> 21:37.310
Where can we find Sterling and
Dodds?

21:38.070 --> 21:40.990
Well, Sterling was killed
in a car crash.

21:41.070 --> 21:42.550
Er... Dodds - cancer.

21:42.630 --> 21:44.390
So, what went wrong?

21:47.190 --> 21:50.350
You know, you gotta understand
it was a war back then.

21:51.190 --> 21:55.230
Something had to be done.
They gave the units free rein.

21:55.310 --> 21:57.390
Unfortunately,
this one got out of control.

21:57.470 --> 21:59.550
Who were the last two members
of Black Heart?

21:59.630 --> 22:03.190
I've told you. I don't know any more.
Hey, hey, hey! Boys. Boys!

22:03.270 --> 22:05.830
Start talking.
What were they doing?

22:05.910 --> 22:07.030
Come on.

22:07.110 --> 22:08.510
Extortion.

22:08.590 --> 22:10.230
Dealing.

22:10.310 --> 22:13.710
Fitting people up for crimes
they hadn't committed. You name it.

22:13.790 --> 22:15.742
Ended up with half the
Black Heart squad

22:15.755 --> 22:17.430
involved in a robbery
in Plaistow.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.790
The security officer got killed.

22:19.870 --> 22:22.670
Your dad blew the whistle
and the shit hit the fan.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.790
They pulled the unit
and your dad gave evidence...

22:26.870 --> 22:28.430
and Sharp never came back.

22:29.350 --> 22:31.670
So was my dad on the take?
What, Ronnie?

22:34.390 --> 22:35.830
No.

22:36.630 --> 22:38.830
Your dad wasn't corrupt.

22:38.910 --> 22:42.590
But you've gotta remember what it
was like back then for a black cop.

22:42.670 --> 22:45.470
He had to turn a blind eye
to a lot of stuff.

22:46.030 --> 22:48.190
So, who was?

22:48.270 --> 22:51.110
Rumour was that the corruption
went to the top.

22:51.790 --> 22:54.950
A lot of things where hushed up,
but Sharp was a dirty little secret.

22:56.030 --> 22:57.950
He'd been blackmailing people for
years.

22:58.030 --> 23:00.070
With what?
He had enough evidence

23:00.150 --> 23:01.910
to sink a few careers.

23:03.110 --> 23:05.470
Maybe he finally rattled the wrong
cage.

23:06.830 --> 23:08.470
You better not be lying.

23:13.830 --> 23:16.510
Hello.
Two Black Heart members to find...

23:16.590 --> 23:18.390
What? Shit.

23:18.470 --> 23:21.630
Ray's been stabbed. He's being
transferred to a hospital.

23:21.710 --> 23:23.750
There's no way
a man like Ray gets attacked.

23:23.830 --> 23:26.030
No way. OK.

23:43.950 --> 23:45.950
They're not picking up.

24:08.910 --> 24:10.990
Can you hurry up, please?

24:13.830 --> 24:16.510
Yo! Service!

24:18.190 --> 24:20.190
I heard you the first time.

24:20.270 --> 24:23.310
Why didn't you answer the first time?
Don't worry about him.

24:23.390 --> 24:25.150
I'm Officer Pike.

24:25.230 --> 24:28.670
We're here to stop Ray Schmitt
from leaving this facility.

24:28.750 --> 24:31.070
You're too late.
If we could just come in.

24:31.150 --> 24:32.750
I can't help you. Why not?

24:32.830 --> 24:35.110
Because he's not here.

24:35.790 --> 24:38.830
He's in there...
on his way to London Central.

24:39.630 --> 24:41.030
That's where my dad is!

24:50.125 --> 24:50.190
Sharp was killed for a reason.

25:01.310 --> 25:02.710
How badly injured?

25:02.790 --> 25:05.670
Stab wound to the lower abdomen.
Not as bad as I'd have liked.

25:05.750 --> 25:08.150
Which hospital? London Central.

25:08.230 --> 25:10.390
Where your dad is.
Where my old man is, yeah.

25:10.470 --> 25:13.310
I'll send a squad immediately.
We're not taking any chances.

25:14.590 --> 25:16.430
We need to know
where that ambulance is.

25:16.510 --> 25:18.350
Get us a location
and we'll intercept it.

25:18.430 --> 25:20.270
Get on it. Kamali stay here with me.

25:20.350 --> 25:22.790
Nell, make sure those boys
don't get into trouble.

25:22.870 --> 25:24.790
Kamali's on that ambulance location.

25:24.870 --> 25:26.950
Nell, for Bish.
I'm gonna join you en route.

25:27.030 --> 25:29.350
Jonsey's heading to the hospital.
Copy.

25:29.430 --> 25:32.030
Fuck you, you piece of shit!

25:34.670 --> 25:36.030
We've got it.

25:36.110 --> 25:39.070
Ambulance on Kirkstall Road,
five minutes from the hospital.

25:39.150 --> 25:40.870
We're on it.

25:55.790 --> 25:58.630
Tracing the call from Ray's phone
now, ma'am.

25:58.710 --> 26:01.390
Tanner for Bishop.
Yeah, boss. Speak to me.

26:01.470 --> 26:04.510
Prison guards found a phone
in Ray's cell with one logged call.

26:04.590 --> 26:07.750
As soon as we know who it was to,
we'll let you know.

26:07.830 --> 26:09.550
Got it.

26:17.190 --> 26:18.710
Oi! Come on, mate!

27:11.959 --> 27:13.759
This guy ain't getting away again!

27:15.679 --> 27:17.239
Fuck!

27:26.759 --> 27:28.119
Oi!

27:28.199 --> 27:30.079
Hurry up!

27:31.359 --> 27:33.999
Too much heat.

27:34.079 --> 27:36.039
We'll finish the old man later.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.399
Go! Go!

27:47.439 --> 27:49.319
Go, go, go!

27:58.119 --> 27:59.759
Let's go! Come on!

28:10.759 --> 28:12.599
You! Fucking get out!

28:12.679 --> 28:15.239
Police! Get out!
We need your car. Come on!

28:15.319 --> 28:16.519
Come on, man!

28:18.439 --> 28:20.679
Tanner for Bishop. Speak to me!

28:22.799 --> 28:24.839
They traced the call to City Hall.

28:24.919 --> 28:27.719
Get there ASAP
and I'll send more backup.

28:28.479 --> 28:30.279
All units to City Hall.

28:30.359 --> 28:32.119
City Hall? Fuck.

28:49.719 --> 28:51.719
Here you are, love.

28:52.559 --> 28:54.159
Great. Thank you.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.879
Bishop for Tanner.
We're at City Hall.

29:01.959 --> 29:04.599
Where's this back-up?
Nell's on her way.

29:09.399 --> 29:11.119
Hey...

29:11.199 --> 29:13.239
That's Arjana, man.
What's she doing here?

29:13.799 --> 29:15.439
Arjana!

29:22.079 --> 29:23.599
Arjana!

29:26.959 --> 29:28.079
Shit.

29:30.719 --> 29:32.879
Nell for Bish.
I'm five minutes away.

29:33.559 --> 29:35.039
Got it.

29:35.119 --> 29:36.679
You gotta call her, bro. I am.

29:42.039 --> 29:43.479
Hi. Hi.

29:43.559 --> 29:45.519
Arjana Pike for Charlotte Carmel.

29:54.279 --> 29:58.119
Sorry to disturb you.
I have Arjana Pike in reception.

30:02.599 --> 30:04.999
Ms Carmel's actually busy
at the moment.

30:10.559 --> 30:14.919
It's gone to message.
We should've taken the lift!

30:16.399 --> 30:18.439
Charlotte, we need to speak.

30:23.679 --> 30:25.879
I don't mean to be rude, Ms...?

30:25.959 --> 30:27.479
Pike.

30:27.559 --> 30:28.599
Mrs.

30:29.359 --> 30:31.239
..Mrs Pike...

30:31.319 --> 30:33.719
but I'm afraid my business comes
first.

30:36.399 --> 30:39.999
Arjana, I really must insist
that you wait outside.

30:46.879 --> 30:49.039
Well, I think you should take a seat.

30:49.119 --> 30:51.839
Arjana, please leave.
You shouldn't have come.

30:51.919 --> 30:54.119
Sit down.

30:57.599 --> 30:59.559
This has gone too far.
I didn't want this.

30:59.639 --> 31:02.319
You lied about the value
of that deposit box.

31:03.839 --> 31:06.559
You should have told me
you were running for Mayor.

31:08.119 --> 31:09.759
That doubles the price.

31:11.519 --> 31:14.879
You wouldn't want me to expose you as
a corrupt ex-cop.

31:19.239 --> 31:21.319
- Yeah, where are you?
- It's over.

31:21.399 --> 31:24.479
- I've paid you what we agreed.
- It's not enough.

31:24.559 --> 31:26.959
You wouldn't want your association
with Black Heart

31:27.039 --> 31:29.279
to ruin your election campaign,
now, would you?

31:29.359 --> 31:31.039
It's Carmel.

31:45.358 --> 31:47.718
Good morning. How can I help you?
Morning, Rebecca.

31:47.798 --> 31:51.118
Deputy Mayor's office, please.
No, no, no. Don't call her.

31:52.518 --> 31:54.318
Bish, Bish.

32:01.958 --> 32:04.838
Nell for Bish.
I've just arrived at City Hall.

32:25.238 --> 32:26.958
Go, go!

32:27.718 --> 32:29.478
This fucker's dead, man.

32:30.638 --> 32:32.038
Stay there.

32:43.678 --> 32:45.158
Stay down, man.

32:48.918 --> 32:50.798
Open that door!

32:51.478 --> 32:53.278
Get the card. Get the card!

32:54.078 --> 32:55.758
The key card!

32:59.918 --> 33:01.478
Open it!

33:01.558 --> 33:03.118
Open the door!

33:07.438 --> 33:08.478
You need... Open it!

33:08.558 --> 33:10.398
You need a code!
You need a code!

33:12.878 --> 33:14.238
Go.

33:24.558 --> 33:25.918
Move it!

33:25.998 --> 33:27.758
Aarghh!

33:35.358 --> 33:36.518
Move it!

34:05.838 --> 34:07.318
You all right? Yeah.

34:07.398 --> 34:09.878
All right, all right, all right.
It's all right.

34:09.958 --> 34:13.197
Calm down. Calm down. It's all
right. It's all right. I'm sorry.

34:16.558 --> 34:17.998
Armed police!

34:36.918 --> 34:38.918
Nell! Nell!

34:51.678 --> 34:54.038
Nell! No!

35:01.918 --> 35:04.118
Nell. Hey. Hey. You all right?

35:04.198 --> 35:05.678
Speak to me. Nell. Nellios.

35:05.758 --> 35:07.478
Baby, please...

35:07.878 --> 35:09.478
Hey, come on.

35:10.398 --> 35:12.598
Babe, talk to me.

35:13.558 --> 35:15.158
Please.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.798
Oi! Bruv!

35:16.878 --> 35:18.718
Go on! Go and get him!

35:18.798 --> 35:21.118
Officer down! City Hall!

35:22.678 --> 35:24.398
Oh, shit!

35:24.478 --> 35:26.038
Nell, Nell, Nell.

35:26.998 --> 35:29.198
Oh, shit. Fuck!

35:29.278 --> 35:30.758
Shit.

35:31.998 --> 35:33.758
Oh, shit.

35:53.398 --> 35:55.118
Aarghh!

35:58.998 --> 36:00.798
Argh!

37:49.238 --> 37:52.678
You have one new message.

37:52.758 --> 37:54.518
Bishop.

37:54.598 --> 37:56.718
About what you said.

37:57.598 --> 38:00.478
Well, I think I was wrong
about it being too soon.

38:00.558 --> 38:02.838
So I did find a lingerie shop

38:02.918 --> 38:05.438
and purchased a little um...

38:06.158 --> 38:09.278
Well, whatever I bought,
I thought you might wanna see it.

38:09.358 --> 38:11.718
Maybe even tonight.
I mean, unless you're busy.

38:11.798 --> 38:14.198
Sitting in that empty flat of yours.

38:14.278 --> 38:15.838
Anyway... Call me back.

38:45.758 --> 38:47.758
It should be you lying in there...

38:48.758 --> 38:51.078
..bleeding out all over the floor.

38:53.758 --> 38:57.518
Ronnie... you've really got to listen
to what I have to say.

38:59.958 --> 39:01.638
Sharp was blackmailing me.

39:01.718 --> 39:03.758
Deposit box?

39:03.838 --> 39:06.318
Yeah.
I really don't give a shit.

39:06.398 --> 39:07.998
Well, there was enough in there
to...

39:08.078 --> 39:09.358
Black Heart?

39:10.078 --> 39:12.878
You and my Dad
and a bunch of corrupt cops, yeah?

39:15.158 --> 39:16.758
Yeah, well...

39:18.118 --> 39:20.398
Sharp had been
blackmailing us for years.

39:20.478 --> 39:22.335
I got a tip-off where
the box was and

39:22.348 --> 39:24.118
decided to end it
once and for all.

39:24.198 --> 39:28.198
He had enough on us to bring down
the whole of the Met, me included.

39:29.238 --> 39:31.358
There was no choice.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.078
So you killed four people?

39:42.438 --> 39:43.918
What about my dad?

39:45.438 --> 39:47.518
Why did you order Ray to kill him?

39:51.198 --> 39:54.878
He just... He just couldn't take
the lying any more.

39:56.118 --> 39:59.118
He was gonna tell you everything.
I couldn't let...

39:59.758 --> 40:01.718
I didn't want to.

40:01.798 --> 40:03.878
He left us no choice.

40:03.958 --> 40:06.318
I feel sorry for you.

40:06.398 --> 40:08.478
I really fucking do.

40:09.478 --> 40:11.918
Do you know
what the problem is with you?

40:12.998 --> 40:19.198
You're a ruthless, corrupt,
self-serving, fucking bitch...

40:20.958 --> 40:23.518
..and my dad was always
better than you.

42:23.158 --> 42:25.158
You know I got you, innit?

42:27.638 --> 42:30.038
And I'm never gonna let you down,
you know.

42:30.118 --> 42:31.718
Whatever happens.

42:33.438 --> 42:35.558
We know shit goes down in this job.

42:38.278 --> 42:39.998
You're family.

42:41.158 --> 42:43.318
My family.

42:43.398 --> 42:45.598
I miss her too, man.

42:45.678 --> 42:47.478
But we're here.

42:47.558 --> 42:49.238
We're alive.

42:49.318 --> 42:51.078
She'd want you to move on.

42:55.238 --> 42:56.678
You good?

43:00.918 --> 43:02.398
Yeah, man. I'm good.

43:14.038 --> 43:16.958
Don't make me cheer you up.

43:23.878 --> 43:26.598
Hey! What you doing? Pike! Pike!

43:26.678 --> 43:28.878
Stop! Stop!
Let's go. What's wrong?

43:35.358 --> 43:36.998
Oh! Oh, oh! Stop it!

43:38.358 --> 43:41.038
Stop being stupid!

43:41.118 --> 43:43.558
What's wrong with you, man?

43:43.638 --> 43:45.678
I just enjoy driving, bruv.

43:46.558 --> 43:48.798
Pike! Pike, don't do it!
