<i>Mimulus bigelovii.</i>

03:47.011 --> 03:49.480
<i>Hey, just checking in on you.</i>

03:50.314 --> 03:52.749
<i>Your email mentioned
a new project.</i>

03:53.951 --> 03:56.253
<i>Just... Just want to know
where you're at.</i>

03:57.188 --> 04:00.157
<i>I... I found something
really sweet yesterday</i>

04:00.291 --> 04:01.525
<i>in her room.</i>

04:02.226 --> 04:05.862
<i>It was this book of pressed
flowers you'd given her.</i>

04:05.996 --> 04:07.830
<i>"Little flowers
for a little sister,"</i>

04:07.965 --> 04:10.034
<i>you wrote on it.</i>

04:11.135 --> 04:14.538
<i>Anyway, we... we just want you
to know that we love you</i>

04:14.672 --> 04:16.373
<i>and we miss you.</i>

04:16.507 --> 04:19.142
<i>I'd love to talk
when you get a chance.</i>

04:19.942 --> 04:22.479
<i>Okay, we'll talk
to you soon, Elly.</i>

07:12.983 --> 07:14.218
Hmm.

07:26.497 --> 07:28.365
Are you okay?
I saw your foot tracks.

07:28.499 --> 07:30.401
I didn't know if you
broke down or something.

07:30.534 --> 07:34.138
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks for checking.

07:34.271 --> 07:37.241
There are better places
to hike out here than this.

07:38.142 --> 07:40.878
I'm actually working.
I'm doing a plant survey.

07:41.011 --> 07:43.247
Oh, my dad was talking
about that.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.149
Something about a plant
that's been spreading.

07:46.183 --> 07:47.684
Yeah,
pretty much.

07:48.585 --> 07:52.389
Um, okay, well,
thanks again for checking.

07:52.523 --> 07:54.124
Do you need any help
with your work?

07:54.258 --> 07:55.692
No, no.
I'm okay.

07:55.826 --> 07:57.761
I'm not supposed
to be out here.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.396
Kind of skipping school.

08:03.066 --> 08:07.438
Yeah, I've done my
fair share of that too.

08:09.239 --> 08:11.341
Oh, you actually could help me
out, though.

08:11.475 --> 08:13.644
I... I'm here at Eagle Head
Canyon, right?

08:13.777 --> 08:17.281
Yeah, it's about a half a mile that
way, uh, where the big dip is.

08:18.649 --> 08:20.317
Awesome. Thanks.

08:24.254 --> 08:27.424
Well, I mean, you're...
you're already out here.

08:27.558 --> 08:29.693
You can...
You can help me if you want.

08:30.961 --> 08:33.730
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

08:34.731 --> 08:37.067
Cool.
Just go down here.

08:41.705 --> 08:42.972
So that...
that's it.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.341
Mm-hmm.

08:45.008 --> 08:46.210
Pretty ugly.

08:46.343 --> 08:48.145
Yeah, that...
For sure.

08:49.213 --> 08:51.548
- You see the different colors?
- Yeah.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.457
- See?
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

09:01.225 --> 09:02.259
- Pretty cool, right?
- Pretty cool. Yep.

09:02.392 --> 09:03.894
You take really
good pictures.

09:04.027 --> 09:05.395
And we'll get this
to the county.

09:05.529 --> 09:07.931
Yeah, I know you're
doing an amazing job

09:08.065 --> 09:09.299
with all of this.

09:09.433 --> 09:11.301
That white shoot over there.

09:11.835 --> 09:13.270
All right. Yeah.

09:13.403 --> 09:15.005
Yeah, that's...

09:15.138 --> 09:18.675
8-5-5-6.

09:18.809 --> 09:19.743
Mm-hmm.

09:19.877 --> 09:21.178
Yep.

09:45.235 --> 09:47.170
What kind of flower
is that?

09:49.606 --> 09:54.311
Oh, um...
it's a buttercup.

09:56.880 --> 09:58.582
My mom had tattoos.

10:06.657 --> 10:09.092
All right, well,
we should get you back

10:09.226 --> 10:11.361
before you get
into trouble.

10:14.665 --> 10:17.001
But we can... we can come
out here sometime,

10:17.134 --> 10:19.469
on a weekend,
if you want.

10:21.039 --> 10:23.373
- Cool.
- Cool.

10:24.908 --> 10:27.177
All right, well, I'll be
a couple of hours behind you.

10:27.311 --> 10:28.912
I still have some
work to do.

10:29.047 --> 10:30.080
Okay.

10:30.213 --> 10:31.582
I'll see you later.

12:46.150 --> 12:49.553
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

12:52.823 --> 12:55.325
Come on. Come on!

13:02.100 --> 13:03.700
Oh, shit.

13:09.406 --> 13:10.674
Oh, fuck.

13:25.223 --> 13:26.456
Hey!

13:27.959 --> 13:29.127
Are you okay?

13:44.808 --> 13:46.376
No, no!

14:00.857 --> 14:02.893
No!

14:17.241 --> 14:18.575
No!

14:23.114 --> 14:26.716
Okay! Okay, okay, okay.

14:28.351 --> 14:29.820
No, no!
Please, no!

14:31.255 --> 14:32.389
No, no!

14:32.522 --> 14:35.159
Okay, okay, okay.
Okay, okay.

14:35.293 --> 14:37.594
What do you need?
What do you need?

14:38.395 --> 14:41.598
Wait. Wait.

14:41.731 --> 14:42.899
Okay.

14:44.768 --> 14:46.536
Do you know
where you are?

14:49.639 --> 14:51.708
Do you know what
direction you're facing?

14:55.378 --> 14:57.347
Do you understand me?

14:58.849 --> 15:00.952
We are hours
from the nearest road.

15:01.085 --> 15:02.419
And the sun is down.

15:02.552 --> 15:04.222
We're in the middle
of the desert.

15:04.354 --> 15:05.889
You need...

15:06.023 --> 15:07.424
Okay!

15:08.259 --> 15:09.492
Um...

15:12.029 --> 15:13.563
Do you have a GPS?

15:14.364 --> 15:15.599
A GPS?

15:17.268 --> 15:19.569
Anything you had is burned
up over there, okay?

15:19.703 --> 15:21.872
I know where we are.
I know this desert.

15:22.006 --> 15:25.309
I can take you wherever
you need to go. Okay?

15:25.442 --> 15:28.411
Just tell... tell me
wherever you need to go.

15:35.852 --> 15:36.954
Salton Sea.

15:38.622 --> 15:39.957
The Salton Sea.

15:42.026 --> 15:43.526
Okay, um...

15:45.997 --> 15:49.466
That's a... that's a big area.
Do you know what part?

15:52.103 --> 15:53.137
Here. Hold on.

15:54.938 --> 15:59.542
North, south, east, west. Where?

16:03.214 --> 16:04.814
Southwest?

16:05.682 --> 16:07.717
Okay,
I can take you there!

16:09.987 --> 16:11.022
Okay.

16:13.623 --> 16:15.126
- Get the drugs.
- Okay.

16:15.259 --> 16:16.526
Get the drugs! Move!

16:18.996 --> 16:21.132
Get it. Get it!

16:21.265 --> 16:22.632
Okay.

17:42.480 --> 17:43.981
Okay,
that's all of it.

17:44.547 --> 17:46.417
- More.
- No.

17:46.549 --> 17:48.486
No, that's all
there was. There...

17:48.618 --> 17:51.688
I mean, there might have been
more, but it's all burnt up.

17:53.224 --> 17:54.557
Move, move.

18:47.445 --> 18:48.778
Salton Sea.

18:50.381 --> 18:51.614
That way.

19:08.631 --> 19:10.201
That way.

21:03.080 --> 21:06.016
What happens once we get
to the Salton Sea?

21:25.735 --> 21:27.904
Look, I have...

21:28.771 --> 21:31.774
Uh, I have two bags
in my trunk

21:31.908 --> 21:35.012
and I think that they
will fit all of the drugs.

21:36.280 --> 21:39.516
Uh, and I will leave you
with the drugs

21:39.650 --> 21:41.118
once we get
to the Salton Sea,

21:41.252 --> 21:42.885
and you can walk the...
the rest of the way with them,

21:43.020 --> 21:44.388
and I will leave.

21:47.424 --> 21:48.726
I won't see anyone.

21:48.858 --> 21:51.996
I won't talk to anyone.
I won't say anything.

21:53.464 --> 21:55.599
And you'll be gone by the
time I'm back to town.

21:57.568 --> 21:59.737
No, I need to know or I'm
not gonna take you there!

21:59.902 --> 22:01.472
- Wait, watch out!
- Whoa!

22:06.343 --> 22:07.378
Stop!

22:59.496 --> 23:00.964
Don't move.

24:16.640 --> 24:19.977
We go. Move.
Get out.

24:27.718 --> 24:28.952
Wait.

24:30.421 --> 24:33.323
Wait. You wanna walk
to the Salton Sea?

24:33.457 --> 24:36.059
That...
That's like 50 miles.

24:36.926 --> 24:38.328
Okay, that'll take
a couple of days.

24:38.462 --> 24:40.864
Let's... Look,
let's just try to fix the car.

24:40.998 --> 24:42.433
Will you let me try?

24:46.270 --> 24:47.971
The truck is stuck.

24:48.739 --> 24:50.474
The wheels are destroyed.

24:54.411 --> 24:57.347
I-I don't
have enough water.

25:01.752 --> 25:03.353
And you have two bags.

25:04.188 --> 25:07.157
Just like you say,
we'll carry on the drugs.

25:08.058 --> 25:09.526
Load them.

25:51.235 --> 25:52.803
Come on. Come on.

25:52.936 --> 25:56.406
We can't... We can't do this.
We're not gonna make it.

26:02.746 --> 26:05.048
Okay, Salton Sea.

29:39.930 --> 29:41.298
Hi, Jim.

29:41.431 --> 29:44.168
<i>Hi there, Jose.
How are you?</i>

29:44.301 --> 29:46.570
- Oh, you know, living the dream.
- <i>Hmm.</i>

29:46.703 --> 29:48.572
How's Imperial County
treating you?

29:48.705 --> 29:52.409
<i>Well, uh, some dirt bikers
just found a buried body</i>

29:52.542 --> 29:55.345
<i>out here on the border of
Imperial and San Diego County.</i>

29:55.479 --> 29:58.049
- Oh, man.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

29:58.182 --> 30:00.417
<i>I think the coyotes got
to it and dug it up.</i>

30:00.550 --> 30:02.285
<i>Otherwise, it was
pretty well-buried,</i>

30:02.419 --> 30:04.454
<i>but it's a mess.</i>

30:04.588 --> 30:06.923
<i>The body was all beaten
and bloodied.</i>

30:07.058 --> 30:09.292
<i>Male, Latino, 40s.</i>

30:09.426 --> 30:11.895
What? You say it's
in my county or yours?

30:12.629 --> 30:14.297
<i>Well, that's why
I'm calling you.</i>

30:14.431 --> 30:17.768
<i>The gravesite has technically
crossed the line of both counties.</i>

30:18.301 --> 30:19.536
<i>I had to check the GPS.</i>

30:19.669 --> 30:21.638
<i>It's in the middle
of the desert.</i>

30:21.772 --> 30:24.274
<i>I don't know how
you wanna handle this.</i>

30:24.407 --> 30:26.443
Now, listen, I appreciate
you reaching out, Jim.

30:26.576 --> 30:29.379
I'm personally really
short-staffed right now.

30:29.513 --> 30:31.648
It's just me out here this week.
Ed's on vacation.

30:31.782 --> 30:33.683
Mary's down to three days
a week in the office.

30:33.817 --> 30:35.019
<i>Yep.</i>

30:35.153 --> 30:36.887
- I could get the coroners out there...
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

30:37.021 --> 30:39.489
...but it'd still be a half
day's drive out of San Diego.

30:39.623 --> 30:41.825
<i>Yeah, I know.
I get it. I get it.</i>

30:41.959 --> 30:43.860
<i>We got a team in El Centro
that can come out.</i>

30:43.995 --> 30:46.197
<i>I just wanna make sure
you guys have the chance</i>

30:46.329 --> 30:48.166
<i>if you wanted it,
you know.</i>

30:48.298 --> 30:50.201
No, I appreciate it, Jim.

30:50.333 --> 30:51.902
<i>You bet, buddy.</i>

30:53.237 --> 30:56.573
You've been seeing, uh, much
drug stuff lately in your area?

30:57.374 --> 30:59.177
<i>Not for a long while.</i>

30:59.309 --> 31:02.280
<i>It's brutal like that shit
from a few years back, though.</i>

31:03.346 --> 31:06.984
<i>Well, I'll email you our report
in a few hours so you have it.</i>

31:07.118 --> 31:08.585
<i>You say safe out there, Jose.</i>

31:08.718 --> 31:10.387
All right.
Yeah, thanks.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.056
Thanks,
I appreciate that, Jim.

31:12.190 --> 31:13.523
<i>My pleasure.</i>

32:13.351 --> 32:14.918
I need a break.

32:16.320 --> 32:17.921
- No.
- Please.

32:19.589 --> 32:21.825
Please, just a few minutes.
I need some water.

32:27.098 --> 32:28.498
Okay.

33:48.346 --> 33:49.579
Hey!

33:56.287 --> 33:57.520
Hey!

33:58.255 --> 33:59.489
Hey!

34:11.900 --> 34:14.504
No. No!

34:16.239 --> 34:18.141
No, no, no.

34:37.860 --> 34:39.196
No!

35:51.569 --> 35:53.104
Oh, Jesus.

36:03.514 --> 36:05.316
What the hell, Alex?

36:14.657 --> 36:17.428
What are you doing without a helmet, Alex?
What did I tell you about that?

36:17.561 --> 36:18.795
I couldn't find it.

36:18.928 --> 36:20.531
It was on the patio.
I saw it this morning.

36:20.663 --> 36:22.866
If you can't find it,
you ask me for a ride or someone else.

36:23.501 --> 36:25.735
Now get off, I'll put it in the
back, We'll take you to school.

36:25.869 --> 36:27.204
I'm two minutes from school.

36:27.338 --> 36:29.373
I don't want you riding
5 feet without a helmet.

36:29.507 --> 36:30.807
Now, come on. Let's go.

36:30.940 --> 36:32.409
I'll just push it there.

36:33.710 --> 36:34.944
Alex.

36:38.781 --> 36:41.285
Drop by the house on my lunch
and bring it to your classroom.

36:41.418 --> 36:42.987
What do you got?
Ms. Marlin, fourth period?

36:43.120 --> 36:45.122
Just leave it in
the front office.

36:45.990 --> 36:46.923
Hey.

36:47.057 --> 36:49.360
<i>Jose, it's Mary.</i>

36:50.561 --> 36:52.296
<i>Jose, you there?</i>

36:57.934 --> 36:59.570
Yeah, Mary. What is it?

36:59.702 --> 37:01.038
<i>Where's your pretty face at?</i>

37:01.172 --> 37:02.640
I'm out here handing out
speeding tickets.

37:02.772 --> 37:04.707
I'll be back in the office soon.
What's up?

37:04.841 --> 37:06.343
<i>Carl from the county is here,</i>

37:06.477 --> 37:08.445
<i>askin' if you've seen
our new botanist, Elly?</i>

37:08.579 --> 37:10.414
Not today, no.

37:10.548 --> 37:12.849
<i>I guess she and Carl were
supposed to meet this mornin'.</i>

37:12.983 --> 37:14.451
<i>He can't get a hold of her.</i>

37:14.585 --> 37:16.819
<i>Drove in from San Diego for it.</i>

37:16.954 --> 37:18.055
I'm sure she just forgot.

37:18.189 --> 37:19.756
Probably still
out in the field.

37:19.889 --> 37:22.426
<i>I told him.
He's pissed, though.</i>

37:22.560 --> 37:24.827
<i>If you see her, have her
give Carl a ring, will you?</i>

37:24.962 --> 37:26.330
<i>He's in a mood.</i>

37:27.565 --> 37:29.967
I know that mood.
Thanks, Mary.

37:32.069 --> 37:36.440
Dad, I was in the desert
with Elly yesterday.

37:37.975 --> 37:39.276
What do you mean?

37:39.410 --> 37:42.046
I skipped school to ride
and I ran into her.

37:42.179 --> 37:43.147
Jesus, Alex.

37:43.280 --> 37:45.349
I learned a lot.
It was really cool.

37:46.517 --> 37:48.953
- Well, did you come back with her?
- No.

37:49.086 --> 37:52.256
She said she was gonna stay out there
a few more hours and then drive back.

37:52.389 --> 37:53.856
Where was she exactly?

37:53.991 --> 37:55.993
At the bottom of the Eagle
Head Canyon or something.

37:56.126 --> 37:58.128
In the plains,
right around there.

37:58.262 --> 37:59.964
What if her car broke down?
Maybe she needs help.

38:00.097 --> 38:01.898
I'm sure she's probably fine.

38:02.865 --> 38:05.768
Did he check her motel?
I'm going to go check.

38:05.902 --> 38:08.405
No, you're gonna go to school.

38:08.539 --> 38:10.740
No, I'm going to find Elly.

38:13.544 --> 38:15.346
God damn it, Alex.

38:15.479 --> 38:17.947
Real quick, and you're going
directly to school.

38:18.983 --> 38:20.351
Open the gate.

38:24.588 --> 38:27.757
I haven't seen her,
uh, since we checked in.

38:30.793 --> 38:32.762
See her car come back
last night?

38:32.895 --> 38:35.932
No. I was workin'.

38:36.066 --> 38:38.402
Not sittin' there
starin' out the window.

38:40.004 --> 38:42.106
We close up the office
at about 8:00.

38:43.173 --> 38:46.043
Oh, you haven't cleaned her room
today, yeah?

38:46.176 --> 38:48.646
What time is it?
10:16. No.

38:48.778 --> 38:52.483
No, maids don't arrive until
after 11:00 durin' the weekdays.

38:55.519 --> 38:57.820
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

38:57.955 --> 38:59.723
No, we're good. Thank you.

38:59.856 --> 39:01.759
Okay, that's good.
Dr. Phil's waiting for me.

39:01.891 --> 39:04.361
- All right, we'll lock up. Thank you.
- Okay.

39:09.866 --> 39:12.202
All her stuff's still here.

39:12.336 --> 39:14.705
I don't think she came back
at all yesterday, Dad.

39:14.837 --> 39:16.707
She didn't sleep
in that bed either.

39:16.839 --> 39:19.009
And she doesn't know
the area at all.

39:22.746 --> 39:24.014
All right,
I'm gonna drive out there.

39:24.148 --> 39:25.316
I'll come with you.

39:25.449 --> 39:27.451
Nice try.
You're goin' to class.

39:27.584 --> 39:31.221
Look, if she turns up,
have Mary try to reach me on the radio.

39:31.355 --> 39:33.424
- Dad.
- Alex.

39:33.557 --> 39:36.694
Don't worry, okay?
I'm sure she's fine.

39:36.826 --> 39:38.462
See you tonight for dinner.

39:39.630 --> 39:41.098
Okay.

43:10.474 --> 43:12.342
We need to get out
of the sun.

43:15.612 --> 43:17.080
We need shade.

43:18.882 --> 43:21.752
We're both burning up.
We need to head to those canyons.

43:26.690 --> 43:28.592
That's not the way.

43:28.725 --> 43:30.460
We're not gonna make it
to the Salton Sea.

43:30.594 --> 43:32.696
It's straight desert
with no shade.

43:33.564 --> 43:35.799
Okay, we need to get back
to Borrego Springs.

43:35.933 --> 43:36.900
No.

43:38.735 --> 43:41.405
If we keep walking this way,
we are gonna die.

43:45.108 --> 43:47.110
Okay, that's the only way.

43:49.746 --> 43:52.482
We get back to Borrego Springs,
I will find you a car,

43:52.616 --> 43:54.885
you can call
whoever you need to call.

43:56.054 --> 43:59.089
And we can go into town at night.
No one's gonna see you.

44:01.124 --> 44:02.426
I don't know.
It... it will take a day,

44:02.559 --> 44:04.328
but it will be shaded canyon
most of the way

44:04.461 --> 44:06.830
and we can do the rest at night.

44:06.965 --> 44:08.298
No. We stay here.

44:08.432 --> 44:10.467
No, we'll die here!

44:15.138 --> 44:16.673
He'll come.

44:16.807 --> 44:18.108
Who?

44:25.382 --> 44:28.052
Do you see anyone here?
We are alone.

44:28.185 --> 44:30.153
No one is ever gonna
find us here, all right?

44:30.287 --> 44:32.189
We're in the middle
of the fucking desert!

44:46.603 --> 44:49.439
You really need to wrap your leg.
Put compression on it.

44:50.674 --> 44:52.509
Tie it up with your jacket.

45:05.089 --> 45:06.657
You have to tie it tight.

45:15.565 --> 45:17.467
We're goin' to the canyon.

47:10.280 --> 47:11.782
Everything all right?

47:13.650 --> 47:16.353
- Speak English?
- Oh yes, yes.

47:20.958 --> 47:22.859
What the hell is that?

47:22.994 --> 47:26.596
Uh, an abandoned truck.
Just found it.

47:26.730 --> 47:28.465
- No one in there, right?
- No, no.

47:28.598 --> 47:30.534
I think
it's been there for a while.

47:32.736 --> 47:34.838
You've seen anyone out there?

47:35.739 --> 47:38.542
No,
there's never anyone out here.

47:38.675 --> 47:41.344
We had a bet to see how
far from camp we could get

47:41.478 --> 47:43.814
before one of us pussed out
from the heat.

47:43.947 --> 47:45.415
It's hot.

47:45.549 --> 47:48.585
Saw your truck drivin'
in the distance.

47:48.718 --> 47:51.621
I thought maybe you were
border patrol or somethin'.

47:51.755 --> 47:53.657
But you're the opposite of that.

47:55.759 --> 47:57.694
Anything good left in there?

47:59.130 --> 48:00.363
Nah.

48:03.034 --> 48:05.902
We should
probably call this in, huh?

48:11.341 --> 48:12.776
No!

48:14.078 --> 48:15.679
No, no, no!

51:22.665 --> 51:24.135
Thank you.

51:51.395 --> 51:53.130
How did your plane crash?

51:58.235 --> 51:59.702
Engine stopped.

52:01.305 --> 52:02.339
No good plane.

52:05.443 --> 52:06.676
Small plane.

52:08.678 --> 52:10.947
No radar on the border.

52:21.925 --> 52:24.261
- What is this stuff?
- Hmm?

52:24.395 --> 52:25.862
This stuff, what is it?

52:30.534 --> 52:31.768
Mmm.

52:49.652 --> 52:51.288
I need to pee.

52:56.893 --> 52:59.096
- Go.
- I can't do this by myself.

52:59.230 --> 53:00.264
Go! Move.

54:20.311 --> 54:21.679
Thanks.

54:21.811 --> 54:23.047
We go.

56:14.824 --> 56:16.126
Mary, you there?

56:17.227 --> 56:19.363
I need help!
Does anyone read me?

56:21.432 --> 56:24.134
I have an emergency.
Does anyone read this?

56:26.903 --> 56:28.605
This is Deputy Sheriff
Jose Gomez.

56:28.739 --> 56:32.376
I got a homicide scene with two
bodies and a third missing person.

56:33.444 --> 56:34.844
Do you copy?

56:39.516 --> 56:40.551
Hello?

56:42.586 --> 56:43.620
Goddamn it!

57:23.293 --> 57:24.962
Does anybody read me?

57:25.996 --> 57:28.265
I need help.
I have an emergency!

57:30.968 --> 57:31.901
Anyone?

58:33.063 --> 58:34.631
Hello, does anybody read me?

58:34.765 --> 58:37.401
This is San Diego County
Deputy Sheriff Jose Gomez

58:37.534 --> 58:40.103
in need of immediate assistance.

59:13.770 --> 59:15.272
Fuck me.

01:03:13.443 --> 01:03:15.645
Pick up.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:03:15.779 --> 01:03:18.749
- <i>Hi, you've reached Jose Gomez...</i>
- Where is he?

01:04:25.582 --> 01:04:27.918
Oh my God,
it's growing out here.

01:04:31.888 --> 01:04:33.390
The path ends.

01:04:34.959 --> 01:04:36.359
Where we go?

01:04:43.034 --> 01:04:44.634
Up that, I think.

01:04:46.536 --> 01:04:48.405
We're at the end of the slot.

01:04:58.015 --> 01:04:59.116
We need rest.

01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:02.452
We can climb this
in the morning.

01:05:02.586 --> 01:05:03.820
Still light.

01:05:05.655 --> 01:05:07.490
We can continue.

01:05:07.624 --> 01:05:09.526
How far Borrego Springs?

01:05:10.261 --> 01:05:12.429
I don't know.
Uh...

01:05:14.564 --> 01:05:17.467
We have to climb to the top, and then
walk through the canyon on the other side,

01:05:17.601 --> 01:05:19.369
and it's still a long
way back to town.

01:05:19.502 --> 01:05:20.871
A really long time.

01:05:23.707 --> 01:05:27.078
We climb, then rest.

01:05:27.211 --> 01:05:29.679
Sleep, finish in morning.

01:05:33.050 --> 01:05:34.151
Yeah, we can try.

01:05:34.285 --> 01:05:35.652
We go.

01:05:36.053 --> 01:05:37.154
You need to untie me.

01:05:39.522 --> 01:05:40.924
If I fall and I die,

01:05:41.058 --> 01:05:42.926
who's gonna carry
your drugs for you?

01:06:41.385 --> 01:06:42.585
Dad, are you there?

01:06:45.122 --> 01:06:46.523
Dad, it's Alex.

01:06:47.557 --> 01:06:48.993
Come on.

01:06:49.126 --> 01:06:50.428
Is someone there?

01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:52.662
I'm looking
for Deputy Sheriff Gomez.

01:06:54.432 --> 01:06:55.799
Please help.

01:07:46.317 --> 01:07:48.885
- Whoa!
- No! No!

01:08:13.244 --> 01:08:14.278
Tomas.

01:08:19.050 --> 01:08:20.251
I'm Elly.

01:08:29.692 --> 01:08:32.029
Why you were out...

01:08:33.729 --> 01:08:35.299
on the desert?

01:08:40.703 --> 01:08:42.206
I'm a botanist.

01:08:43.907 --> 01:08:45.742
A plant scientist.

01:08:47.243 --> 01:08:50.814
I'm doing a survey on that plant
we saw earlier in the canyon.

01:08:52.916 --> 01:08:55.286
Something that isn't
supposed to be here.

01:08:56.252 --> 01:08:57.620
Like us.

01:09:04.627 --> 01:09:06.029
I was a teacher.

01:09:09.433 --> 01:09:10.899
Who knows how to fly?

01:09:12.935 --> 01:09:14.305
My father...

01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:18.875
he was a pilot.

01:09:22.345 --> 01:09:25.082
As kid, we fly a lot.

01:09:26.417 --> 01:09:27.850
He taught me.

01:09:29.487 --> 01:09:31.020
I don't like fly.

01:09:34.425 --> 01:09:36.292
Okay, so why
do you do it?

01:09:41.599 --> 01:09:43.234
I lost my job.

01:09:46.703 --> 01:09:48.104
No work.

01:09:52.774 --> 01:09:56.846
My cousin got me a job
in a fishing boat.

01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:59.682
Moving gasoline.

01:10:02.253 --> 01:10:06.423
I didn't know that the
gasoline was for the cartel.

01:10:12.563 --> 01:10:14.298
My father is sick.

01:10:21.639 --> 01:10:23.040
And the...

01:10:25.242 --> 01:10:26.943
medicine is...

01:10:29.446 --> 01:10:31.048
expensive.

01:10:41.992 --> 01:10:45.828
Sometimes,
when the monster comes...

01:10:47.097 --> 01:10:48.966
you have to say "yes."

01:10:59.109 --> 01:11:00.244
Yours.

01:11:03.414 --> 01:11:06.016
What is buttercup?

01:11:17.161 --> 01:11:19.263
It's my favorite
wild flower.

01:11:22.700 --> 01:11:23.933
Um...

01:11:25.935 --> 01:11:27.404
That's it.

01:11:28.738 --> 01:11:31.609
It was my nickname that my sister
gave me when she was little.

01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:33.477
She gave me that
a few years ago.

01:11:41.051 --> 01:11:43.953
She was younger than me.
She was my half-sister.

01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:49.426
And she wanted to be just like me.
She...

01:11:52.196 --> 01:11:55.366
wanted to grow up
really fast.

01:11:58.801 --> 01:12:00.170
She...

01:12:02.306 --> 01:12:03.873
She's not here?

01:12:05.643 --> 01:12:06.876
No.

01:12:10.314 --> 01:12:14.318
She was so funny
and so smart.

01:12:14.451 --> 01:12:16.153
And I wasn't. I was...

01:12:18.389 --> 01:12:21.891
...awkward and anxious,
and I never felt comfortable.

01:12:27.965 --> 01:12:30.367
So I started
taking stuff...

01:12:32.770 --> 01:12:34.605
for depression
and anxiety.

01:12:34.738 --> 01:12:37.441
Stuff to go to sleep,
stuff to stay awake, stuff just to...

01:12:39.643 --> 01:12:42.112
just to help me forget.

01:12:44.481 --> 01:12:47.318
Then one morning,
she asked me to drive her to school,

01:12:47.985 --> 01:12:49.219
and I...

01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:53.023
I had been up
for like three days.

01:12:55.159 --> 01:12:57.061
But I couldn't
tell her "no."

01:13:02.599 --> 01:13:04.368
Then I ran a red light.

01:13:11.041 --> 01:13:13.010
And I watched her die.

01:13:23.587 --> 01:13:26.090
And after that I just...
I couldn't be in that town,

01:13:26.223 --> 01:13:29.560
and drive down that road,
and see her room.

01:13:37.067 --> 01:13:38.535
So I ran.

01:13:40.237 --> 01:13:42.939
I ran from everything
and everyone.

01:13:44.007 --> 01:13:46.276
And I have to keep running.

01:13:49.879 --> 01:13:51.615
We can keep running.

01:14:49.907 --> 01:14:54.077
Father of my father told him,

01:14:55.112 --> 01:14:56.513
and he told me...

01:15:12.095 --> 01:15:15.732
"Never run like a lamb."

01:15:18.168 --> 01:15:19.603
"Run like a wolf."

01:15:35.619 --> 01:15:36.987
We sleep.

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:15.646
Come on.

01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:47.811
Dad!

01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:31.555
Dad!

01:19:35.559 --> 01:19:36.593
Dad!

01:19:41.065 --> 01:19:42.299
Dad!

01:19:43.067 --> 01:19:45.936
Alex? Alex?

01:19:46.070 --> 01:19:47.304
Dad!

01:19:49.473 --> 01:19:50.774
Alex!

01:19:52.409 --> 01:19:53.978
Dad, where are you?

01:19:54.112 --> 01:19:55.779
- Dad!
- Alex, be careful!

01:20:00.417 --> 01:20:01.852
I can't see you.

01:20:01.986 --> 01:20:04.654
It's not safe.
You gotta go now, honey.

01:20:04.788 --> 01:20:06.157
Are you okay?

01:20:06.289 --> 01:20:07.758
Alex, get out of here!

01:20:07.891 --> 01:20:10.560
- Tell me you're okay.
- I'm fine, honey. Okay?

01:20:10.694 --> 01:20:13.897
I... I'm a little banged up,
but you gotta go now.

01:20:14.731 --> 01:20:16.067
What's going on?

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:18.035
I don't know.
Bad things.

01:20:18.668 --> 01:20:21.605
I found Elly's car
and two dead bodies.

01:20:22.272 --> 01:20:24.407
I chased a man up here
who shot at me.

01:20:25.375 --> 01:20:27.245
Listen to me.
I need you to take my truck

01:20:28.012 --> 01:20:30.447
and drive as fast as you can
till you get reception,

01:20:30.580 --> 01:20:32.116
and then let 'em know
what's goin' on.

01:20:32.250 --> 01:20:35.519
Your radio's destroyed.
Your truck's out in the desert.

01:20:37.354 --> 01:20:40.757
Okay, listen to me. Then you just
drive back as fast as you can

01:20:40.891 --> 01:20:42.926
and tell 'em
what's going on, okay?

01:20:43.060 --> 01:20:46.930
Town is hours away. Then they're hours
away, even when I get back to call.

01:20:47.064 --> 01:20:49.432
They don't care about us.
You've said that.

01:20:50.001 --> 01:20:51.568
It's just you and me.

01:20:51.701 --> 01:20:54.938
I need to get you out of here
and we're going to find Elly.

01:20:55.072 --> 01:20:57.941
Listen to me. We can't! Okay?
It's dangerous here.

01:20:58.075 --> 01:20:59.676
I don't know
if he's coming back.

01:20:59.810 --> 01:21:01.745
I need you to get back
as fast as you can.

01:21:01.878 --> 01:21:03.713
Try to drive
without the headlights.

01:21:03.847 --> 01:21:06.483
I'm not going to leave you.
I'm going to get you out.

01:21:06.616 --> 01:21:09.853
No, we can't! Listen to me!
Get out of here now!

01:21:09.987 --> 01:21:12.322
No, I am going
to get you out!

01:21:12.455 --> 01:21:14.491
You're the sheriff
and I'm your daughter!

01:21:14.624 --> 01:21:17.861
It's just the two of us and you know it!
There's no one else to help!

01:21:25.069 --> 01:21:27.337
Do you have any
rope in your truck?

01:23:14.979 --> 01:23:17.814
Come on, come on.

01:23:22.519 --> 01:23:25.156
Okay, this is the number for
the deputy in the next county.

01:23:25.289 --> 01:23:26.923
As soon as your phone
starts getting reception,

01:23:27.058 --> 01:23:28.993
call him and tell him
where I'm heading.

01:23:29.126 --> 01:23:31.028
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna follow that guy's car tracks

01:23:31.162 --> 01:23:33.697
into the canyon
and see if I can't find Elly.

01:23:34.731 --> 01:23:36.400
- Be safe.
- You, too.

01:23:36.533 --> 01:23:38.235
Ride fast. Don't stop
for anything.

01:23:38.369 --> 01:23:39.803
I love you.

01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:19.116
Hey!

01:30:40.691 --> 01:30:42.025
Alex?

01:31:06.717 --> 01:31:07.950
Elly?

01:31:19.863 --> 01:31:21.432
No!

01:31:32.109 --> 01:31:33.977
Come on. Let's go.

01:31:58.836 --> 01:32:00.070
Alex.

01:32:27.764 --> 01:32:28.999
Come on.

01:32:31.568 --> 01:32:32.603
Come on.

01:32:34.638 --> 01:32:35.672
Hang on.

01:33:13.011 --> 01:33:14.378
He's coming!

01:34:10.068 --> 01:34:11.535
No!

01:34:17.140 --> 01:34:19.576
Elly! Elly!

01:34:20.477 --> 01:34:22.813
Come on. Come on!

01:34:26.483 --> 01:34:28.385
Come on.

01:34:37.594 --> 01:34:38.695
No!

01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:41.431
No, no!

01:34:42.165 --> 01:34:43.734
No!

01:34:45.802 --> 01:34:46.903
No! No!

01:35:27.145 --> 01:35:28.679
Hey!

01:35:32.315 --> 01:35:34.718
No, no. No, no, no.

01:35:34.851 --> 01:35:36.520
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:35:36.653 --> 01:35:38.588
No! No!

01:36:20.263 --> 01:36:21.498
Elly.

01:36:40.851 --> 01:36:41.918
Alex!
