One of the Beach Boys, Mike Love

19:48.062 --> 19:52.066
and he's right over there.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.986
Where did he go? I lost him.

19:52.108 --> 19:54.986
I lost a whole Beach Boy.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.364
- Excuse me, I'm over here.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.364
- Oh!

19:58.405 --> 20:00.366
- Dr. Love, how you doing?

19:58.405 --> 20:00.366
- How you doing?

20:00.407 --> 20:01.659
What are you doing down here?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.536
Well, I heard, I heard

20:01.701 --> 20:03.536
you begging for help

20:03.577 --> 20:05.371
and-and I think

20:03.577 --> 20:05.371
it's a great cause

20:05.412 --> 20:07.414
and one-to-one,

20:05.412 --> 20:07.414
I think we can work it out.

20:07.456 --> 20:10.043
You'd really put us over

20:07.456 --> 20:10.043
the top if you'd sing a song.

20:10.084 --> 20:12.211
Well, I'd love to sing

if we could get those

20:12.252 --> 20:14.380

20:14.421 --> 20:17.633

20:14.421 --> 20:17.633
- Oh, thanks. Here you go.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.218
Okay.

20:19.259 --> 20:21.012
I'm gonna sing the song.

I'm singer, you're drummer.

Right.
