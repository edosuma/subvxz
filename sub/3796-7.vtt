<i>What's your best memory
of our relationship?</i>

01:17.134 --> 01:21.370
- Um, what's this movie rated?
- <i>Cute.</i>

01:21.404 --> 01:24.241
No, but we did have lots
of nonsexual fun too, didn't we?

01:24.275 --> 01:27.511
Tons. I guess that's why
I agreed to do this.

01:27.545 --> 01:30.114
Is he really going
to show this movie to Sophia?

01:30.149 --> 01:33.318
I have to admit,
even I find it to be a little creepy.

01:33.352 --> 01:34.636
It's classier than it seems.

01:34.802 --> 01:36.922
And I'm like the Francis Ford Coppola
of iMovie.

01:36.956 --> 01:38.790
Check it out.

01:44.264 --> 01:46.065
He was so sweet and thoughtful.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.984
I've never been treated
better in my life.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.871
- You guys remember Amber.
- Hey.

01:50.938 --> 01:52.195
How are you doing, Amber?

01:52.361 --> 01:54.141
- I'm off to an ultrasound.
- <i>Ah.</i>

01:54.176 --> 01:55.643
- Congratulations.
- Good luck.

01:55.677 --> 01:57.812
- Oh, thank you.
- Bye.

01:57.846 --> 01:59.547
- And thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:59.581 --> 02:02.216
- Anything for you.
- And we will see you soon!

02:02.251 --> 02:04.719
- Bye, guys.
- <i>Bye.</i>

02:04.753 --> 02:06.154
<i>She's really sweet.</i>

02:06.188 --> 02:08.223
Hey, bro, didn't I used
to bang her sister?

02:08.257 --> 02:10.559
Yeah. Actually, she said
she asked about you.

02:10.592 --> 02:12.761
- Well, of course.
- Probably wants to find out

02:12.796 --> 02:14.330
if you were the one
that gave her the herps.

02:14.364 --> 02:16.678
Well, at least I get laid often enough
to be a suspect.

02:16.844 --> 02:20.170
- Interesting logic. All right, I gotta roll.
- I gotta roll too, actually.

02:20.205 --> 02:22.172
- Where are you going?
- Fighting the fight.

02:22.207 --> 02:24.208
Meeting the De Lucas to see
if we're moving forward.

02:24.242 --> 02:26.563
This is either the end of Don Peppe's
or the true beginning.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.647
- You sure I can't help?
- I'm fighting this fight alone, Vin, but thank you.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.216
- Okay, good luck.
- See you guys later.

02:31.250 --> 02:33.185
- Later.
- See you.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.198
- You hear from Phil about the miners movie?
- It ain't happening, bro.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.423
He said he loved E script.

02:38.458 --> 02:40.125
Yeah, but because
of my strike he hates me.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.528
- He said that?
- Well, he hasn't said anything.

02:42.562 --> 02:45.331
I sent the guy a six-dozen
delicious cookie apology

02:45.366 --> 02:47.901
and haven't even gotten a response.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.294
Look, to be honest with you, Vince,

02:49.460 --> 02:52.372
these last few weeks
have been so traumatic,

02:52.407 --> 02:53.965
I just want to enjoy what I do have.

02:54.131 --> 02:57.278
- All right, don't give up on me, big bro.
- I'm not giving up.

02:57.313 --> 03:00.282
- You want to be in front of the camera?
- Yeah, of course I do.

03:00.316 --> 03:02.217
Okay, then we're making that movie.

03:03.820 --> 03:06.422
- You're the only one that res.
- And care I do.

03:06.456 --> 03:09.024
I'll tell you what...
You drop off my movie to Sophia

03:09.058 --> 03:10.459
and I'm gonna call Ari.

03:10.493 --> 03:13.662
And this time
I won't take no for an answer.

03:13.696 --> 03:15.070
I'll read it today, I promise.

03:15.236 --> 03:17.155
- You haven't even read it?
- <i>Listen, Vinnie,</i>

03:17.321 --> 03:20.637
I am sorry I let my personal
life trump business.

03:20.671 --> 03:24.607
But since there's nothing left to
do on that front, I will focus.

03:24.642 --> 03:25.909
This isn't business.

03:25.943 --> 03:28.044
This is personal
for Johnny and for me.

03:28.079 --> 03:30.180
<i>And I've always thought that
we were kind of</i> <i>like family,</i>

03:30.214 --> 03:31.670
<i>so this should be
personal for you too.</i>

03:31.836 --> 03:33.630
I hear you.
I will read it immediately.

03:33.796 --> 03:35.719
- And then you'll call me back?
- Yes, I will, Vinnie.

03:35.753 --> 03:38.121
- I'll talk to you soon. Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

03:40.291 --> 03:42.681
Would this be the script
you're referring to?

03:42.847 --> 03:45.628
What, are you going
through my stuff now?

03:45.663 --> 03:48.698
I see a script, I read it.
Occupational hazard.

03:48.732 --> 03:50.897
- What else did you go through?
- I saw your divorce papers.

03:51.063 --> 03:53.817
- Now that's a good read.
- <i>Well, I just glanced.</i>

03:53.983 --> 03:57.362
- Do you have a plan?
- Bank loan.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.198
Gotta pay the missus back what she
loaned me, plus half my worth.

04:00.364 --> 04:04.046
- Oh, you can spare it.
- <i>She</i> can spare it.

04:04.080 --> 04:05.480
The only reason I didn't knock out

04:05.515 --> 04:07.716
that fire crotch flay
for being in my house

04:07.751 --> 04:09.618
is I can't afford a lawsuit.

04:09.653 --> 04:12.188
Ari, you're separated.

04:12.222 --> 04:14.123
She can do what and whom she wants.

04:14.158 --> 04:15.839
Yeah, but it's <i>my</i> fuckin' house.

04:16.005 --> 04:20.197
- Can we change the subject?
- Sure.

04:20.199 --> 04:22.971
Why don't you tell me what that script
is like so I don't have to read it?

04:23.137 --> 04:25.102
Well, I only read the first 15 pages.

04:25.136 --> 04:28.071
- It's for Vince?
- It's for Drama-- TV movie.

04:29.673 --> 04:31.774
Well, that explains why
I was almost crying already.

04:31.808 --> 04:34.316
- <i>That bad?</i>
- It's that emotionally manipulative.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.279
- I'll read it.
- You know what? Send me a copy,

04:37.313 --> 04:38.680
I'll get it over to my old assistant.

04:38.714 --> 04:40.281
She's running
the hallmark channel now.

04:40.316 --> 04:44.052
This is not what a power
couple should be focusing on.

04:44.086 --> 04:47.088
Well, it's better than focusing on your wife.

04:47.123 --> 04:49.525
- What wife?
- You're a quick learner.

04:49.559 --> 04:50.992
See? You've been beating me--

04:51.027 --> 04:53.795
I mean teaching me well for 20 years.

04:53.830 --> 04:56.965
That's cute, Ari, very cute.

05:00.403 --> 05:02.302
Hey, what are you doing?

05:02.468 --> 05:04.679
- Working. What are you doing?
- Nothing.

05:04.845 --> 05:06.908
- Uh, can we talk for a second?
- About?

05:06.942 --> 05:09.611
- About Galecki.
- No.

05:09.645 --> 05:12.380
No. Okay well, he just
booked a big movie.

05:12.415 --> 05:14.215
I don't care.

05:14.283 --> 05:16.718
It's based on a huge huge trilogy.

05:16.752 --> 05:18.553
- Could be the next <i>Harry Potter</i>.
- I don't care.

05:18.588 --> 05:20.822
Could be worth, I don't know,
millions of dollars to us.

05:20.856 --> 05:22.990
Scott, I don't fucking care.

05:23.025 --> 05:25.126
Well, I fucking do care, okay?

05:25.160 --> 05:27.528
I am here in this place
to make money.

05:27.562 --> 05:30.865
No, you're here because I threw away my
marriage to start a company with you.

05:30.899 --> 05:33.334
Incorrect, okay?
You threw away your marriage

05:33.369 --> 05:35.136
when you refused to sign
a prenup, okay?

05:35.171 --> 05:38.473
Let me ask you a question.
You really think that Sloan fucking Galecki is okay?

05:38.507 --> 05:40.608
I think you are sleeping
with her ex-mother.

05:40.642 --> 05:42.177
But I didn't throw it in her face.

05:42.211 --> 05:45.446
So you admit it?
You're admitting it.

05:45.481 --> 05:46.881
That's our client, fucking idiot.

05:46.916 --> 05:50.151
You know, Scott, this is why I
<i>knew</i> not to partner up with you,

05:50.185 --> 05:52.953
because you are
a self-centered jerkoff.

05:52.987 --> 05:54.821
And this is why, Eric...
And I mean this

05:54.856 --> 05:57.457
in the nicest possible way...
You are a little bitch.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.392
Get over Sloan.
She's obviously over you.

05:59.427 --> 06:00.894
I'm not even talking
about her, all right?

06:00.928 --> 06:02.562
And I'm not even talking
about Galecki at this point.

06:02.596 --> 06:04.564
I'm talking about us.
All right, I'm leaving.

06:04.599 --> 06:06.500
- Fire him or I'm not coming back.
- Oh really?

06:06.534 --> 06:07.909
Well, then what the fuck would I do?

06:08.075 --> 06:11.271
You know what? You joke, Scott,
but what would you do, really?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.875
I don't understand.
Where did you guys find this place?

06:14.909 --> 06:17.277
"People" magazine said that
the Octomom used to eat here

06:17.311 --> 06:19.545
every time she came to town,
so I wanted to see it.

06:19.580 --> 06:21.213
Who knew it'd be closed down, right?

06:21.248 --> 06:24.383
But I already found the perfect
place, which I budgeted out.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.685
You don't want to see it?

06:26.720 --> 06:30.522
- Oh.
- This is the place, Turtle. Look at this.

06:30.556 --> 06:33.024
I'd still like you to see
the place I found.

06:33.058 --> 06:37.896
- John.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

06:37.930 --> 06:40.692
Turtle, can we be honest with you?

06:40.858 --> 06:43.267
- Please.
- Be honest with him, Gina.

06:43.301 --> 06:46.337
Hey, Turtle, we came to L.A. for
a free trip and to see some stars.

06:46.371 --> 06:48.366
We really didn't think
you'd have much to offer.

06:48.532 --> 06:51.008
- But I proved you wrong.
- Well yeah, you've impressed us a little.

06:51.042 --> 06:53.610
But <i>really</i> impress us
and make this happen.

06:53.645 --> 06:56.246
- We like it here.
- Guys, this place is huge.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.381
It's gotta be at least
twice what I budgeted for.

06:58.415 --> 07:01.250
So? Go back to your
investors and get more.

07:01.284 --> 07:02.751
Will you guys put anything in?

07:02.786 --> 07:05.988
- Our blood, sweat and tears.
- But no money?

07:06.022 --> 07:08.090
Not a dime.
And we split all profits 50-50.

07:08.124 --> 07:09.725
- Well, that's--
- So do we like?

07:09.759 --> 07:11.931
- We love.
- What can you do on the price?

07:12.097 --> 07:14.096
You haven't even asked
what the price is yet.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.631
I'm sure I need it reduced.

07:15.665 --> 07:18.200
It's a great value and a great spot.

07:18.234 --> 07:21.036
No hard sell here,
but Wolfgang puck's people

07:21.070 --> 07:22.538
looked at it yesterday.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.540
I'm pretty sure they're
gonna make an offer.

07:24.574 --> 07:25.975
So if you don't want
to have a bidding war...

07:26.010 --> 07:27.911
We don't. We want it.
What do we gotta do?

07:27.945 --> 07:30.080
Sign the lease, give me
100k down payment.

07:30.114 --> 07:31.715
Turtle, you got your checkbook?

07:31.749 --> 07:33.117
- Uh...
- Write her a check, Turtle.

07:33.151 --> 07:36.087
Can you excuse us one second? Guys.

07:37.489 --> 07:39.924
Okay, I need you to tell me

07:39.958 --> 07:41.559
what's so perfect about this place.

07:41.593 --> 07:44.047
John is sentimental, Turtle,
and he believes in fate.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.397
- And?
- And when we woke up this morning

07:46.431 --> 07:48.265
and we were driving here,
we were talking about

07:48.300 --> 07:50.835
what a great place
this could be for our spot.

07:50.869 --> 07:52.404
Just then we saw it.

07:52.438 --> 07:55.741
And John looked up at the street name...
Bellarosa.

07:55.776 --> 07:59.912
- That's his mother's name.
- That's my mother's name, Turtle.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.380
She always loved Hollywood.

08:01.415 --> 08:04.683
So this is the place,
or there is no place.

- Hi.
- Oh hi.

08:27.908 --> 08:30.076
I need to drop something
off for Sophia Lear.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.078
- I can take it.
- It's all right.

08:32.113 --> 08:33.613
I really need to speak to her.

08:33.648 --> 08:36.750
- Thanks.
- Um, let me see if she's in.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.308
- What's your name?
- Johnny Chase.

08:38.475 --> 08:40.655
- Hello, Johnny.
- <i>Sophia.</i>

08:40.688 --> 08:42.147
- How you doing?
- <i>I'm okay.</i>

08:42.313 --> 08:45.358
- What are you doing here?
- <i>I brought you something from Vince.</i>

08:45.393 --> 08:47.427
Oh, it's not Anthrax, is it?

08:47.461 --> 08:49.729
No. Why would you say that?

08:49.763 --> 08:51.831
I don't know.
We seem to have our differences.

08:51.866 --> 08:53.633
- It's a gift.
- For what?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.868
Look, I don't know
what you did to the guy,

08:55.903 --> 08:58.604
but it's really really important
to him that you like him.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.172
It's amazing to me that you don't.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.976
Oh no, I like him fine, Johnny.
I just don't date celebrities.

09:03.010 --> 09:05.312
Yeah?
Well, who do you date?

09:05.346 --> 09:09.250
Well, my last boyfriend was head of
pediatric surgery at Johns Hopkins.

09:09.284 --> 09:12.760
A surgeon? Eh, he probably didn't
have the time to treat you right.

09:12.926 --> 09:16.291
Look, I know that
a woman of your stature

09:16.326 --> 09:19.495
may have preconceived notions about a
guy like Vince, but you should know,

09:19.529 --> 09:22.198
especially after interviewing
him, he's not just some actor.

09:22.232 --> 09:25.067
He's smart...
Maybe not John...

09:25.102 --> 09:26.535
- What's his name?
- Hopkins.

09:26.570 --> 09:28.985
Hopkins kind of smart,
but he's smart.

09:29.151 --> 09:33.541
More importantly, he's a
friend and a brother...

09:33.575 --> 09:35.643
The best I know of both.

09:37.279 --> 09:39.179
It's very sweet of you
to look out for him.

09:39.214 --> 09:42.716
Well, that's all he does
for me, so I owe him.

09:42.750 --> 09:45.653
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

09:51.126 --> 09:53.694
<i>Knock knock.</i>

09:53.729 --> 09:56.054
Oh no.
Are you crying, Ari?

09:56.220 --> 10:00.135
- No, I'm not crying.
- You need a good dose of Dr. Marcus.

10:00.170 --> 10:01.604
Do you like this script?

10:01.638 --> 10:04.229
I loved it.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.897
Why isn't it getting made?

10:06.063 --> 10:10.312
Moonves says he'll only make it
with Yagoda, however he wants.

10:10.346 --> 10:12.529
What does Yagoda say?

10:12.695 --> 10:14.549
He will not return my calls.

10:14.583 --> 10:19.487
Jake, get Phil Yagoda on the phone.

10:21.557 --> 10:23.057
Are you okay, Ari?

10:23.092 --> 10:26.461
This character, Lloyd...

10:28.031 --> 10:29.865
He loses his wife and his family,

10:29.899 --> 10:32.134
travels halfway across the
world to save these guys

10:32.169 --> 10:33.925
so they can be with
their loving families.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.506
- You know what the saddest part is?
- No.

10:40.444 --> 10:43.012
I don't even have my dog.

10:43.047 --> 10:46.082
This job, Vince...
It's all I got.

10:48.085 --> 10:49.482
Is your department ready?

10:49.648 --> 10:51.734
That's why I'm here.
They're waiting.

10:51.900 --> 10:54.090
All right, let's do this.

11:00.832 --> 11:03.399
I don't know most of you.
Why would I?

11:03.434 --> 11:05.101
I don't deal with TV.

11:05.135 --> 11:08.037
I especially don't deal
with made-for-TV movies.

11:08.072 --> 11:09.639
This is different.

11:09.673 --> 11:13.243
Vince Chase wants this
for his brother Johnny.

11:13.277 --> 11:16.679
Now we all know that Johnny
Chase may have limited talent,

11:16.714 --> 11:19.181
but like a child with special needs,

11:19.216 --> 11:21.472
a real family member
will stand by his side.

11:21.638 --> 11:24.620
<i>A real family member will buy
that child's way</i>

11:24.654 --> 11:27.255
<i>into Harvard if that's what it takes.</i>

11:27.290 --> 11:30.325
Vince Chase is standing
by his brother

11:30.360 --> 11:32.394
and I'm standing by both of them.

11:32.429 --> 11:36.399
Now I want every available
option on the table

11:36.433 --> 11:39.035
for how to get this film made
by the end of the day.

11:39.069 --> 11:42.673
Whoever succeeds will forever
be my family member.

11:42.707 --> 11:45.376
Whoever doesn't will be
cleaning tanning beds

11:45.410 --> 11:46.914
in fuckin' rancho cucamonga.

11:47.080 --> 11:49.292
I'm sorry, Ari.
Dana Gordon's on the phone for you.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.249
Looks like I just did
your job for you.

11:52.284 --> 11:54.318
You're all fired.

11:56.287 --> 11:58.722
She said a script that solid

11:58.757 --> 12:01.325
hasn't come across her desk
in a long time.

12:01.359 --> 12:05.183
I guess our boy Billy Walsh
has found his groove again.

12:05.349 --> 12:08.732
- I admit, it moved me.
- <i>Unfortunately,</i>

12:08.766 --> 12:11.334
she saw Zack Levi
from "Chuck" when she read it,

12:11.369 --> 12:14.237
- <i>not Drama.</i>
- That's not gonna work, Dana.

12:14.271 --> 12:15.805
<i>The script is an easy sell,</i>

12:15.839 --> 12:17.445
Drama is not.

12:17.611 --> 12:19.541
You know what? I'll call you back.

12:19.576 --> 12:21.610
<i>Are we having dinner tonight?</i>

12:21.644 --> 12:24.660
Listen, you jam it down hallmark's hall
of fame and we can have breakfast too.

12:24.826 --> 12:26.781
Goodbye, Ari.

12:26.816 --> 12:29.918
- Any word from Yagoda?
- No. They said he'd call back.

12:29.952 --> 12:31.753
Call Vince and tell him
I'll pick him up.

12:31.787 --> 12:33.920
We'll go to Yagoda's together.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.005
There's nothing shady
going on over here, Tex.

12:36.171 --> 12:40.510
Well, Turtle, when a guy tells you
he needs 250 grand and you say okay,

12:40.676 --> 12:42.998
<i>and then he says, "well, actually,</i>

12:43.032 --> 12:45.390
now I need 500 grand,"
it sounds shady.

12:45.556 --> 12:48.184
The restaurant's square footage
doubled, but so will the profits.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.739
How much more are you putting in?

12:49.773 --> 12:51.741
<i>I'm putting in every dime
i have, Tex.</i>

12:51.775 --> 12:53.477
- I don't have any more.
- Well, neither do I.

12:53.511 --> 12:55.178
<i>Come on, you got an eight-year</i>

12:55.213 --> 12:56.943
$180 million contract.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.696
I've also got three kids in private
school in Greenwich, Connecticut.

12:59.862 --> 13:02.420
- Yeah, but...
- You don't have 3 kids in private school

13:02.454 --> 13:04.826
- in Greenwich, Connecticut, do you, Turtle?
- No.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.924
Well, you don't know how
expensive it is then, do you?

13:06.958 --> 13:09.292
- No.
- <i>Turtle, find another way.</i>

13:09.327 --> 13:11.561
<i>And don't try to guilt me.
It doesn't work.</i>

13:11.596 --> 13:13.751
Okay.

13:13.917 --> 13:16.031
I mean, am I talking
about this too much?

13:16.066 --> 13:17.633
No, I like Sloan bashing.

13:17.667 --> 13:20.702
I just feel like everything she's
ever said to me has been a lie.

13:20.737 --> 13:23.605
- "I don't date actors"?
- That's the biggest bullshit line of all time.

13:23.673 --> 13:25.041
I used to say I don't fuck agents.

13:25.075 --> 13:26.976
Then I married one and he fucked me.

13:27.010 --> 13:29.346
- I'm so pissed.
- Let it all out, E.

13:29.380 --> 13:31.349
You're the only one
I can talk to about this too.

13:31.383 --> 13:33.384
Trust me, my friends
are over hearing about it.

13:33.418 --> 13:36.054
Hate for the McQuewicks
is something I will never tire of.

13:36.088 --> 13:38.757
Plus, your anger
really got you going.

13:38.791 --> 13:41.193
Really?
What do you mean?

13:41.228 --> 13:44.430
I mean this is the first
really good sex we've had.

13:44.464 --> 13:46.732
- Really?
- I mean for me.

13:46.766 --> 13:49.402
- I'm sure it's always been great for you.
- Yeah.

13:49.436 --> 13:51.270
Let's be honest.
You don't really hate her.

13:51.305 --> 13:52.906
Are you kidding me?

13:52.940 --> 13:55.875
- No. I think you love her.
- Not even a little bit.

13:57.411 --> 14:00.413
- Hello?
- Your ex-fiancee

14:00.447 --> 14:02.800
sipping drinks with a certain
frizzy-headed actor.

14:02.966 --> 14:05.803
- What?
- Sloan and Galecki are at the Farmers Market, E.

14:05.969 --> 14:07.638
You've gotta be fucking kidding me.

14:07.804 --> 14:09.588
You want me to go crack him
in the head or something?

14:11.258 --> 14:14.394
No, leave it alone.
I'm over it.

14:14.428 --> 14:17.497
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay, thanks.

14:17.531 --> 14:19.599
Later.

14:19.633 --> 14:22.268
What happened?

14:22.303 --> 14:24.804
Sloan and Galecki are
at the Farmers Market.

14:24.838 --> 14:27.373
Ah, but you're over it.

14:30.277 --> 14:32.445
I'll fucking kill somebody.

14:32.480 --> 14:35.081
Do you want to fuck
one more time before you do?

14:36.917 --> 14:39.151
- Sophia Lear?
- You know her?

14:39.186 --> 14:40.653
Of course I do.
Great writer.

14:40.687 --> 14:42.655
Did a piece on me a few years ago.

14:42.689 --> 14:44.992
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah. She's smart.

14:45.026 --> 14:47.694
- That I know.
- And sexy.

14:47.728 --> 14:49.663
Yeah, but that's not it.

14:49.697 --> 14:51.197
I've never had this feeling before.

14:51.232 --> 14:53.934
- Maybe it's the rejection.
- No, I don't think so.

14:53.968 --> 14:56.170
Wow, I've never
seen you so infatuated

14:56.205 --> 14:57.739
by a girl before, except maybe Sasha.

14:57.773 --> 14:59.607
And you were all drugged out.

14:59.642 --> 15:01.576
I'm serious about this, Ari.

15:01.611 --> 15:03.579
You ever have that feeling
where you just know?

15:03.613 --> 15:05.314
- Immediately?
- Yeah, mm-hmm.

15:05.348 --> 15:07.116
Once, 20 years ago
when I met my wife.

15:07.150 --> 15:10.452
- Aw, I'm sorry, Ari.
- Hey, listen. It lasted 20 years.

15:10.486 --> 15:14.022
And if you really do feel this way,
then fight for it.

15:14.056 --> 15:16.158
- Thanks, Ari.
- Ari, he's in a meeting.

15:16.192 --> 15:17.960
Listen, if he would have
called me back,

15:17.994 --> 15:19.995
we could've avoided
me interrupting it.

15:20.030 --> 15:21.863
I'm just with him.

15:25.101 --> 15:27.402
Busy day, Phil?

15:27.437 --> 15:30.471
Jesus Christ.
Ari, what the fuck?

15:30.637 --> 15:32.807
<i>It's okay, Robin.
Uh, ahem.</i>

15:32.974 --> 15:35.976
Come on in.

15:37.078 --> 15:38.878
<i>I was going to call you back.</i>

15:38.913 --> 15:40.546
No, you weren't, which is nuts.

15:40.581 --> 15:42.748
Look, I love the script, Vince.

15:42.783 --> 15:46.418
- But you're mad at my brother.
- No no, it's... it's not that.

15:46.453 --> 15:48.388
Business is business,
strikes are strikes.

15:48.422 --> 15:51.524
- When it's over, there's no grudges held.
- So what's the problem then?

15:51.558 --> 15:53.327
Moonves wants a bigger name.

15:53.493 --> 15:56.061
- Oh, come on.
- Chris Noth, Christian Slater,

15:56.095 --> 15:58.463
- one of the good-looking guys that was on "Lost."
- Oh my God.

15:58.497 --> 16:01.099
It's a fucking TV movie, Phil.

16:01.133 --> 16:04.297
- I know, but...
- No buts, Phil. You're pissed.

16:04.463 --> 16:06.372
Is that it?
You're holding a grudge, Phil?

16:06.406 --> 16:09.742
Are those the cookies my brother
sent you, all smashed up?

16:09.777 --> 16:12.713
Okay, fine, I...

16:12.747 --> 16:16.050
I am pissed and I am hurt

16:16.084 --> 16:20.722
because I am the only person
in this fucking town

16:20.756 --> 16:23.224
that has stood by your brother.

16:23.259 --> 16:26.494
And instead of working with
me, he just fucking walked.

16:26.529 --> 16:28.997
<i>And I still have to work with him</i>

16:29.031 --> 16:31.165
on "Johnny Bananas"
every day... every day.

16:31.199 --> 16:33.734
So why the fuck would I want
to work with him

16:33.768 --> 16:35.469
on something else too every day, huh?

16:35.503 --> 16:38.905
- Um, I am pissed.
- You have to look at the bigger picture.

16:38.940 --> 16:40.440
Johnny's going to kill this.

16:40.474 --> 16:42.709
Walsh wrote an incredible
script with his voice in mind

16:42.743 --> 16:44.377
and he's gonna direct
the hell out of it.

16:44.411 --> 16:46.513
I have no doubts
about the movie, Vince.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.882
- I don't.
- How do we get you over this, Phil?

16:49.951 --> 16:51.485
I don't know if I can.

16:51.519 --> 16:53.320
How about your charity?
What are you working on now?

16:53.354 --> 16:55.489
Still the German Shepherd thing?

16:55.523 --> 16:57.758
Yeah, it's horrible what people
do to that beautiful breed.

16:57.792 --> 17:01.896
- $5,000 from me just to say yes to this.
- $5,000, Ari?

17:01.930 --> 17:05.191
Wow. That might feed
10 dogs for a week.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.702
I'm going through a fuckin'
divorce right now, Phil!

17:07.736 --> 17:10.906
- I'll give you $100,000.
- Really?

17:10.940 --> 17:13.075
But we don't mention this again.

17:20.184 --> 17:22.124
- What happened?
- We're making a movie.

17:22.290 --> 17:25.154
- Seriously?
- Prime time, c.B.S.

17:25.188 --> 17:27.122
Yes!
Come over here.

17:27.156 --> 17:30.692
Oh, I can't thank you
enough, baby bro.

17:30.726 --> 17:32.294
- You too, Ari.
- Ah.

17:32.328 --> 17:33.795
All right.

17:33.829 --> 17:35.029
Ah!

17:36.596 --> 17:39.533
- Come on, Amaré.
- <i>Come on, Amaré what?</i>

17:39.568 --> 17:42.186
- You think cash grow on trees?
- Your trees maybe.

17:42.352 --> 17:45.106
I gotta think if I want to put the
original 250 in with you, Turtle.

17:45.272 --> 17:47.741
I'll telling you, Amaré, you
don't want to miss out on this.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.027
I got everybody.
I got Melo. I got Eli.

17:50.193 --> 17:52.678
- <i>I got Strahan--</i>
- Oh, you got Strahan, huh?

17:52.712 --> 17:55.180
- Who got me for what?
- I spoke to him today.

17:55.215 --> 17:56.993
- Hey, Turtle's on this Don Peppe thing.
- Oh yeah.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.584
- <i>Did he call you for more money?</i>
- <i>Oh yeah.</i>

17:59.618 --> 18:01.998
- What did you tell him?
- I told him to go fuck himself.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.657
- Amaré, listen...
- Hey, go fuck yourself, Turtle.

18:06.326 --> 18:08.895
All right.

18:12.366 --> 18:15.301
- Hey, Alex.
- Turtle, why are you guilting Tex?

18:15.468 --> 18:17.971
- Listen, I wasn't...
- <i>And why can't you put any more money</i>

18:18.005 --> 18:19.539
<i>into this sure thing
anyway?</i>

18:19.574 --> 18:21.075
Because I don't have any more money.

18:21.109 --> 18:22.343
What are you talking about?

18:22.377 --> 18:23.644
I thought you were in
that avion tequila deal.

18:23.810 --> 18:26.012
- Yeah, I made a few bucks.
- <i>A few bucks?</i>

18:26.047 --> 18:27.547
I heard it went public today.

18:28.683 --> 18:31.717
- What?
- <i>Call Tex and apologize.</i>

18:31.752 --> 18:34.086
We're trying to win a ring around here.

18:38.725 --> 18:40.870
Hey, anyone using this chair?

18:41.036 --> 18:43.748
- You must be kidding.
- What? Is it weird seeing me here?

18:43.914 --> 18:45.664
I mean we used to
eat here all the time.

18:45.698 --> 18:47.733
- I picked this place, Eric.
- <i>Really?</i>

18:47.767 --> 18:49.401
- Did you, Johnny?
- Hi, Sloan.

18:49.436 --> 18:51.737
Are you fucking serious?

18:51.771 --> 18:53.339
Eric, what are you doing here?

18:53.373 --> 18:55.841
- He's here to upset me.
- We're here to have lunch.

18:55.875 --> 18:58.110
- Oh, then we'll leave.
- Oh, what a shame.

18:58.144 --> 19:00.078
Melinda, what are you, like 60?

19:00.113 --> 19:01.713
Isn't this a little beneath you?

19:01.747 --> 19:03.809
No, this sort of Drama
keeps me feeling young.

19:03.975 --> 19:06.084
- That and all the plastic surgery.
- Not even a syringe.

19:06.119 --> 19:07.897
Why don't you mind your
own business, Galecki?

19:08.063 --> 19:11.400
- You interrupted our lunch.
- <i>Yeah well, it's a free country.</i>

19:11.566 --> 19:14.028
So if you wouldn't mind telling your
boyfriend here to leave Melinda alone...

19:14.194 --> 19:16.989
Your cougar may tell you what to do,

19:17.155 --> 19:19.597
- but I don't boss my men around.
- Yeah? That's funny.

19:19.631 --> 19:21.999
You certainly had a lot of suggestions
for me when we were dating.

19:22.034 --> 19:24.413
Eric, would you like to take
this around the corner?

19:24.579 --> 19:26.290
I'll bang your smug
face out right here.

19:26.456 --> 19:29.460
- Respected actors don't get in public brawls.
- Ha!

19:29.626 --> 19:31.477
Oh really? Is that why you're
dating an actor, Sloan?

19:31.511 --> 19:34.547
- Because he's "respected"?
- This is so fucking stupid.

19:34.581 --> 19:36.782
Stupid?
Stupid how?

19:36.817 --> 19:40.486
- You mean like Seth Green was stupid?
- Oh my God, you're joking.

19:40.521 --> 19:43.089
- What about Seth Green?
- Sloan hit that too.

19:43.123 --> 19:44.657
- Really?
- No.

19:44.692 --> 19:46.793
- Believe what you want.
- Look, you started it.

19:46.827 --> 19:48.861
I called you after the
last time we hooked up.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.264
You basically said you used
me and you were moving on.

19:51.298 --> 19:54.200
- I'm trying.
- By fucking my clients at the Farmers Market?

19:54.234 --> 19:55.735
- All right.
- You're running around

19:55.769 --> 19:58.438
with my ex-stepmother
who's twice your age.

19:58.472 --> 20:01.274
I needed some youth after
your corpse of a father.

20:01.308 --> 20:04.176
I never figured you for
the revenge type, Eric.

20:04.210 --> 20:06.778
And I never figured you for a slut.

20:10.950 --> 20:14.219
Oh, you're fired.
Go fuck yourself.

20:16.622 --> 20:18.723
Well, so what did the bank say?

20:18.757 --> 20:20.191
Well, the loan isn't a problem.

20:20.225 --> 20:22.560
I just have to
personally guarantee it.

20:22.627 --> 20:25.329
- How does that make you feel?
- Not good.

20:25.364 --> 20:27.598
But business is good.

20:27.633 --> 20:29.434
Yeah, business is good.
It's not great.

20:29.468 --> 20:32.404
It's just not where I wanted to be

20:32.438 --> 20:34.373
at this stage in life, you know.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.542
Sometimes I wonder if I have worked

20:36.576 --> 20:38.678
all this time to end up with nothing.

20:43.451 --> 20:46.620
- It's your wife.
- Well, it could be my kids.

20:46.654 --> 20:51.457
- I didn't say anything.
- I'm just not going to get it.

20:51.492 --> 20:53.593
<i>Don't ignore your kids because of me.</i>

20:53.628 --> 20:56.229
- It could be my wife.
- Look, it could be your kids.

20:56.263 --> 20:58.465
<i>Well, I'm... you know,
I'm going to call them back.</i>

20:58.499 --> 21:00.926
- Jesus.
- What do you want me to do?

21:01.092 --> 21:03.369
- Am I wasting my time here, Ari?
- Dana--

21:03.404 --> 21:05.505
because I don't have time to waste.

21:05.539 --> 21:07.607
You did this when we were 20.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.341
<i>I was emotional.</i>

21:09.375 --> 21:12.511
I'm 40 now and I'm logical.

21:14.413 --> 21:16.280
I don't know where this is going.

21:16.315 --> 21:19.884
I know that I get a great
feeling when I'm with you.

21:19.918 --> 21:21.719
But?

21:25.190 --> 21:28.092
But I still love my wife.

21:30.362 --> 21:32.196
Then go back to her.

21:32.230 --> 21:34.799
- She doesn't want me.
- I don't believe that.

21:34.834 --> 21:37.169
She just wants something
you're not giving her.

21:37.203 --> 21:39.905
- What?
- I don't know.

21:39.940 --> 21:43.242
You're smart.
Figure it out.

21:46.614 --> 21:48.048
Don't be mad at me.

21:48.082 --> 21:51.451
I am sad, Ari.

21:51.486 --> 21:55.590
But you're honest,
so how can I be mad?

22:04.901 --> 22:08.569
<i>We caught up with billionaire
mavericks owner mark Cuban</i>

22:08.604 --> 22:10.972
<i>who just made
another boatload of money</i>

22:11.006 --> 22:12.831
<i>on his tequila company going public.</i>

22:12.997 --> 22:16.543
<i>Hmm, wonder how a super-rich guy
celebrates</i> <i>something like that.</i>

22:19.213 --> 22:21.280
<i>Oh, just like
the rest of us.</i>

22:22.816 --> 22:24.134
Hello?

22:24.300 --> 22:26.136
Oh, hi.
This is Sophia Lear for Vince.

22:26.302 --> 22:28.889
<i>I think the cellphone number
he gave me was wrong.</i>

22:28.924 --> 22:30.992
- Oh hey. It's Turtle.
- <i>Hello, Turtle.</i>

22:31.026 --> 22:32.960
- Did you get the movie?
- Yes, I did.

22:32.995 --> 22:35.797
- <i>Did you like it?</i>
- I honestly didn't know what to make of it.

22:35.831 --> 22:37.298
He is very persistent,
your friend, though,

22:37.333 --> 22:39.191
- isn't he?
- <i>Not usually.</i>

22:39.357 --> 22:42.069
To be honest, I've actually never seen
him put any real effort in with a girl.

22:42.235 --> 22:43.872
<i>You made a real impression on him.</i>

22:43.906 --> 22:45.707
This is just so bizarre.

22:45.741 --> 22:47.142
You don't even know bizarre.

22:47.176 --> 22:49.043
This morning the guy was reading
"the Wall Street Journal"

22:49.078 --> 22:50.678
'cause he doesn't think
he's smart enough for you.

22:50.713 --> 22:52.713
Maybe he's not.

22:52.747 --> 22:56.383
<i>Sophia, I'm just going to say
a couple of things to you.</i>

22:56.417 --> 22:59.503
First, Vince is the best guy
I've ever known.

22:59.669 --> 23:01.654
He takes care of so many people

23:01.689 --> 23:03.690
and makes so much happen for them

23:03.724 --> 23:05.926
and doesn't expect
anything in return.

23:06.092 --> 23:07.894
<i>You know this guy paid off
my mother's mortgage</i>

23:07.929 --> 23:10.731
<i>when they were going to repossess
her house and he never told us?</i>

23:10.765 --> 23:13.033
And this was years ago
when he only had a few bucks.

23:13.068 --> 23:15.185
That's very sweet.

23:15.351 --> 23:18.907
Just give him a shot, Sophia.
I swear it'll be worth it.

23:18.941 --> 23:21.309
Most bizarre courtship of my life.

23:21.343 --> 23:22.944
That's how we roll.

23:22.978 --> 23:24.479
Tell him I leave town tomorrow,

23:24.513 --> 23:26.047
and if he can meet me for a drink

23:26.081 --> 23:27.948
at the chateau at 9:00, then--

23:27.983 --> 23:29.491
<i>I guarantee you he will be there.</i>

23:29.657 --> 23:31.718
<i>Nice talking to you, Turtle.</i>

23:31.752 --> 23:33.887
You too, Sophia. Bye.

23:36.123 --> 23:38.057
You want to shoot in Prague?

23:38.092 --> 23:39.792
I don't care if we shoot
in Culver City.

23:39.827 --> 23:42.337
I'm so happy.
Yo, Turtle!

23:42.503 --> 23:44.531
- Yo.
- <i>Vince got me the movie.</i>

23:44.565 --> 23:46.700
Really?
That's amazing.

23:46.734 --> 23:50.070
- And Billy's directing.
- Redemption for all.

23:50.104 --> 23:53.515
- Wow, that's incredible.
- Isn't it?

23:53.681 --> 23:57.436
- I got some news for you too, Vin.
- Do tell.

23:57.602 --> 24:00.348
- You want the good or the bad first?
- You know I always go good.

24:00.382 --> 24:03.192
- Sophia called right before you walked in.
- She did? What did she say?

24:03.358 --> 24:05.187
- She wants to meet for a drink tonight.
- Really?

24:05.221 --> 24:07.696
- Ah.
- <i>I think she thought the movie was weird,</i>

24:07.862 --> 24:09.907
but I told her a few stories of
my own that may have turned her.

24:10.073 --> 24:13.561
- I really appreciate that.
- Yeah, I talked to her today too, bro.

24:13.596 --> 24:15.797
I didn't want to say anything
in case it didn't pan out.

24:15.831 --> 24:19.167
- You guys are too good to me.
- Not always.

24:19.201 --> 24:21.770
Okay, what's the bad news?

24:21.804 --> 24:25.606
- What, no luck getting money for Don Peppe's?
- No. Struck out.

24:25.641 --> 24:27.716
- Let me put in a little.
- Vince, no.

24:27.882 --> 24:29.644
You know, I feel like
he's trying to cut me out.

24:29.678 --> 24:32.079
The guy's got his hands on a potential
gold mine and I can't get a piece.

24:32.114 --> 24:34.448
Yeah. What, are we gonna have
to pay for our own baked clams?

24:34.482 --> 24:36.751
Very selfish.

24:36.785 --> 24:38.519
Okay, what's wrong?

24:38.685 --> 24:41.722
I really was trying to do
this myself, you know?

24:41.756 --> 24:45.259
- You've done so much for me, Vin.
- What happened?

24:45.293 --> 24:49.497
- Avion went public today.
- It did?

24:49.532 --> 24:51.432
And if not for my selfish desire

24:51.467 --> 24:53.534
to prove that I don't need you,

24:53.568 --> 24:55.036
if we didn't sell our stock,

24:55.070 --> 24:57.171
I would've made almost $4 million.

24:57.205 --> 25:01.309
And what's worse...
You would've made almost 15.

25:01.343 --> 25:03.510
- Jesus.
- Wow, that's unbelievable.

25:03.545 --> 25:07.381
I'm sorry, Vin.
I'm so stupid.

25:07.415 --> 25:10.784
You're not stupid. You're smart for
getting me into this tequila thing.

25:10.819 --> 25:13.187
And I'm smart for not
fucking listening to you.

25:13.221 --> 25:15.389
- What?
- I never sold.

25:15.555 --> 25:18.259
- Wait, what do you mean?
- I knew this thing was going to be huge

25:18.293 --> 25:20.027
because you told me
it was going to be

25:20.061 --> 25:22.463
and because I called mark
Cuban who guaranteed it.

25:22.497 --> 25:25.032
So I kept my shares
and I even bought yours.

25:25.067 --> 25:27.268
Don't fuck with me right now, Vin.
Please?

25:27.302 --> 25:29.537
Cuban told me I'd regret
it forever if I didn't,

25:29.571 --> 25:31.406
so I bought them for you.

25:31.440 --> 25:33.308
I mean, you gotta
give me back the initial,

25:33.342 --> 25:35.143
but seems like a good trade...

25:35.177 --> 25:36.910
$300,000 for almost $4 million.

25:37.076 --> 25:40.414
- Turtle's a millionaire?
- Yeah. And nowhat he doesn't need me,

25:40.448 --> 25:42.617
maybe he'll let me invest
in his restaurant.

25:44.586 --> 25:46.621
I... I don't know what to say.

25:46.655 --> 25:48.823
Say "thank you," you dumb fuck.

25:48.857 --> 25:51.425
Thank you, Vin.

25:52.994 --> 25:55.963
Thank <i>you</i> for the
good words for Sophia.

25:55.997 --> 25:59.032
I have a feeling a lot of good
stuff is coming to all of us.

25:59.066 --> 26:01.634
- Agreed.
- Do me a favor...

26:01.668 --> 26:04.170
Call E, tell him I can't make dinner.

26:04.204 --> 26:06.406
You got it, boss.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.541
I love that guy.

26:15.917 --> 26:17.918
Jesus Christ.

26:17.953 --> 26:19.487
What the fuck are you doing, Eric?

26:19.521 --> 26:22.056
- I wanted to talk to you.
- I don't want to talk to you.

26:22.090 --> 26:23.657
- I wanted to apologize.
- Save it.

26:23.692 --> 26:25.083
- And I didn't mean it.
- <i>Oh, you didn't?</i>

26:25.249 --> 26:28.429
- I know it was mean.
- You are mean, Eric,

26:28.464 --> 26:30.465
only I didn't realize it
until recently.

26:30.499 --> 26:32.799
- I'm not mean, Sloan. I just--
- You just?

26:32.965 --> 26:35.385
- I want to get back together.
- That will never happen.

26:35.551 --> 26:38.472
- Why? Because of Johnny Galecki?
- Please just leave me alone.

26:38.638 --> 26:40.557
Sloan, I was hurt, okay?

26:40.723 --> 26:42.943
And I couldn't stand seeing
you with some asshole.

26:42.978 --> 26:44.612
I was never with him.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.348
We went out once and I
had lunch with him today

26:47.382 --> 26:49.317
to tell him it couldn't work.

26:49.351 --> 26:50.984
- Why couldn't it work?
- It doesn't matter.

26:51.150 --> 26:53.195
- Because you're not over me.
- It doesn't matter.

26:53.361 --> 26:55.892
Why can't you just admit that
you still have feelings for me?

26:55.926 --> 27:00.264
My family hates you, Eric.
And I love them.

27:00.298 --> 27:04.101
So even if I wasn't over you,
I could never be with you,

27:04.136 --> 27:06.203
so it doesn't matter.

27:06.237 --> 27:08.839
So please just leave me alone.

27:10.442 --> 27:12.810
Look, I just want you to know that

27:12.844 --> 27:15.312
I'm sorry for everything
I've ever done to you.

27:15.347 --> 27:17.748
You've done more than you know.

27:17.783 --> 27:19.917
What do you mean?

27:21.220 --> 27:23.288
What does that mean, Sloan?

27:23.322 --> 27:25.790
I'm pregnant, E.

27:25.824 --> 27:28.093
And as much as you think I'm a slut,

27:28.127 --> 27:31.858
I haven't been with anyone
<i>but</i> you, so it's yours.

27:32.024 --> 27:36.969
- Wow, Sloan, I mean...
- I'm going to New York like I planned.

27:37.003 --> 27:41.473
And I don't want or need
anything from you, <i>ever.</i>
