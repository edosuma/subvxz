WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.640
Now, you hear that?

00:03.640 --> 00:06.640
That's a song thrush. Now, once we
strike out into the fields,

00:06.640 --> 00:08.960
we'll hear a great variety
of different birds.

00:08.960 --> 00:12.480
I'm keeping my fingers crossed
for a reed warbler.

00:12.480 --> 00:14.640
All right, team, packs on.

00:14.640 --> 00:18.280
Oh, it would be lovely
if we had packs, wouldn't it?

00:18.280 --> 00:19.720
Yes, it would, Patrick.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.560
Sorry, when you said
Dawn Chorus Club,

00:21.560 --> 00:23.320
I thought you meant
we'd be singing.

00:23.320 --> 00:24.640
No. Just the birds, Kitty.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.640
Will there be tits?

00:26.640 --> 00:28.480
Only joined so I could say that.

00:28.480 --> 00:30.320
Typical, Julian.

00:30.320 --> 00:32.040
And you can stop
that sniggering, Robin.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.640
Robin?

00:34.640 --> 00:36.000
Where's Robin?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.960
I don't want to be
a harbinger of doom...

00:38.960 --> 00:40.680
He does.

00:40.680 --> 00:42.440
...but I haven't seen him
for two days.

00:42.440 --> 00:45.000
Three, now you come
to mention it.

00:45.000 --> 00:47.080
Oh, no. You don't think...?

00:47.080 --> 00:48.440
He's been sucked off.

00:48.440 --> 00:50.000
Lucky beggar.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.200
Oh, you don't really think
he's gone, do you?

00:53.200 --> 00:55.760
Wh-wh-wh-what if he has?
What if he has?

00:55.760 --> 00:56.880
What would we do?

00:56.880 --> 00:59.640
Hold... Hold!

00:59.640 --> 01:03.400
No. There he is. 12 o'clock.

01:03.400 --> 01:06.200
Oh, goodness. Oh, dear.

01:06.200 --> 01:09.280
Well, that's a relief.
That was a right old scare.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.600
For a moment there,
I thought that he'd, erm...

01:11.600 --> 01:13.960
Mary?

01:13.960 --> 01:16.920
Oh!

01:25.600 --> 01:27.400
Just been watching
my mouse family.

01:27.400 --> 01:29.480
They had little babies.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.640
It was very nice.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.080
What?

01:34.120 --> 01:35.640
It's Mary.

01:36.960 --> 01:38.160
She's gone.

01:40.320 --> 01:41.360
Ah.

01:42.760 --> 01:46.960
So, who wants to see
a mouse baby? Eh?

02:08.680 --> 02:11.240
Just... gone?

02:12.960 --> 02:14.440
She was there.

02:14.440 --> 02:16.600
And then she was not there.

02:16.600 --> 02:20.680
It was all very sudden.
A whoosh and then... pff!

02:20.680 --> 02:24.760
Why her? Why now?
What does it mean?

02:24.760 --> 02:27.000
Whoo!

02:34.440 --> 02:36.200
Who died?

02:36.200 --> 02:38.960
All right, who died? Mike...

02:38.960 --> 02:41.520
It's... Mary.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.160
Mary? From the farm shop?
She's, like, 35.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.720
How did she...? No. No.

02:45.720 --> 02:47.440
Our Mary.

02:47.440 --> 02:49.080
Mary.

02:49.080 --> 02:51.720
She's moved on,
or-or passed over.

02:51.720 --> 02:53.640
Oh. The one that smells
like toast,

02:53.640 --> 02:55.400
spies on me in the bathroom?
She's gone?

02:56.320 --> 02:58.200
Oh.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.240
Oh, come here.

03:03.240 --> 03:05.440
It's what she wanted, Alison.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.680
Yeah. She was always talking
about being sucked off.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.800
Moving on.

03:09.800 --> 03:11.560
I don't think
we need dwell on it.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.720
No point fussing.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.840
Well, she's gone,
and I don't know what to do!

03:16.840 --> 03:19.840
Ah. Going to be
one of those days, is it?

03:19.840 --> 03:22.680
I'll go and see if she's
all right, poor little thing.

03:22.680 --> 03:26.200
Well, this all looks very jolly.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.680
Lots to sort out, I imagine.
I can help if you like.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.640
Please may I help? I'd like help.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.080
Yeah, yeah, if you like.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.960
Erm, Mike's booked a birthday party

03:33.960 --> 03:35.400
for the ballroom today. Party?

03:35.400 --> 03:38.520
Yeah. Ethel and Biddy's
86th birthday.

03:38.520 --> 03:41.160
There's going to be cakes
and tea and dancing.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.960
Dancing?! I am all over this one.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.560
Entertainer - booked. Wine - sorted.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.800
Food - a tick, a tick.
Old ladies, they love me.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.920
This is going to be
Button House perfection.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.560
Jolly good. Something to organise.

03:54.560 --> 03:55.960
Busy.
# It's a paaarty

03:57.400 --> 04:00.480
Robin, there's a great
deal to organise first, so...

04:00.480 --> 04:03.160
I am sorry for your loss,
by the way.

04:03.160 --> 04:04.920
Or not loss, whatever it is.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.560
Take your time. I got this.

04:06.560 --> 04:07.600
Mm.

04:12.280 --> 04:13.760
Kitty?

04:15.040 --> 04:16.160
Kitty, love...

04:17.880 --> 04:19.680
There, there, pet.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.880
Hey. Stop crying.

04:24.880 --> 04:27.680
She's gone, Pat. She's gone.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.560
No. No.

04:30.560 --> 04:33.120
No, I mean,
she might still be with us.

04:33.120 --> 04:34.960
Gosh. Do you think?

04:34.960 --> 04:38.720
Well, we're still here
and we died, didn't we?

04:38.720 --> 04:40.800
Maybe she's still here.

04:40.800 --> 04:43.160
But just on another level.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.120
She's probably looking down
on us now right now and saying...

04:48.160 --> 04:50.360
"..There's really no need to cry."

04:50.360 --> 04:51.640
Really?

04:51.640 --> 04:54.560
Hello, Mary. Hello.

04:55.600 --> 04:59.480
So, she's become a ghost-ghost?

04:59.480 --> 05:00.840
Yeah.

05:00.840 --> 05:03.720
Gosh. And how long
will she stay like that?

05:04.760 --> 05:06.000
Three months.

05:13.200 --> 05:15.160
Well, here we go.

05:15.160 --> 05:17.680
Come on, ladies.
Out you get.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.280
Hey. You must be Toby.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.600
Hey. I'm Mike.

05:20.600 --> 05:22.000
Hi. Welcome to Button House.

05:22.000 --> 05:26.440
Wow. It's amazing.
You own all this?

05:26.440 --> 05:28.120
Yeah. Yeah.
Well, it owns us, really.

05:28.120 --> 05:30.560
Some pretty big loans
and, er, yeah...

05:30.560 --> 05:31.880
Where are the birthday girls?

05:31.880 --> 05:34.280
And who might you be?

05:34.280 --> 05:36.040
Well, this is Ethel
and this is Biddy.

05:36.040 --> 05:38.040
The birthday girls!

05:38.040 --> 05:39.840
Yeah...

05:39.840 --> 05:42.120
Yeah.

05:42.120 --> 05:45.480
Well, because of names... nowadays...

05:45.480 --> 05:47.480
So, yeah.

05:47.480 --> 05:50.280
Right. Well, sorry we're
a little ahead of everyone else,

05:50.280 --> 05:52.400
but these two are just so excited.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.480
Aren't you? It's your birthday!

05:54.480 --> 05:55.520
Yeah! Cool.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.320
Well, I actually just have to

05:57.320 --> 05:59.360
speak to my wife about the, erm...

05:59.360 --> 06:01.000
Just two secs.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.360
Sit. Hi.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.880
Well, it's very nice, isn't it?

06:05.880 --> 06:08.520
What is it? Those little girls.
They're so sweet.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.280
Yeah. They're Ethel and Biddy.

06:10.280 --> 06:11.760
What?

06:11.760 --> 06:13.560
They're... Oh!

06:13.560 --> 06:14.840
Oh, no, Mike.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.000
They left a message.
They definitely said 86.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.520
It's a joint party for
Ethel and Biddy, eight and six.

06:21.520 --> 06:24.040
See? Ethel and Biddy, 86.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.200
Eight AND six, Mike.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.560
We have to fess up
and just, like, cancel.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.160
Oh, Mike...

06:33.160 --> 06:37.520
Look at those little kids.
We can't let down those girls.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.280
I'm useless with kids.

06:39.280 --> 06:40.480
Ask my sister.

06:40.480 --> 06:42.080
Mike, everyone loses a toddler

06:42.080 --> 06:44.000
in the big Tesco's
from time to time.

06:45.480 --> 06:47.400
All right. All right.
I'll get dressed

06:47.400 --> 06:50.320
and I'll look after the kids.
You're on logistics.

06:50.320 --> 06:52.520
Ah. Logistics. Splendid.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.560
Yeah, slight change of plan.
It's now a children's party.

06:55.560 --> 06:56.840
Oh, right. Yeah.

06:56.840 --> 06:59.240
Oh, well, that's splendid.
More to organise.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.120
Of course, you can't physically...

07:01.120 --> 07:02.560
Point me towards the enemy.

07:02.560 --> 07:04.160
Guests. Guests.

07:04.160 --> 07:07.160
All right. Let's give them
a day they'll never forget.

07:07.160 --> 07:08.560
Game face.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.520
Other game face?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.520
It's so good to know
she'll be here, Pat.

07:15.520 --> 07:18.640
I still want to tell her
so much. I know.

07:18.640 --> 07:19.760
And you can.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.560
But only for three months, you said.

07:21.560 --> 07:25.080
Huh? Oh, yes, I did,
didn't I? Erm, but, erm...

07:25.080 --> 07:27.400
And after that,
she'll be gone-gone?

07:28.920 --> 07:33.720
Oh, no. No, no,
because there's another layer.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.360
Another layer? Mm-hm.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.000
But how will she get there?

07:37.000 --> 07:40.800
She must pass through a gate.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.160
A gate?

07:42.160 --> 07:45.280
Yeah. The Gate of, er...

07:48.800 --> 07:52.280
...Herbert. The Gate of Herbert.

07:52.280 --> 07:53.880
But what if she can't find the gate?

07:53.880 --> 07:59.800
Oh, but she will, for she is
shown the way by a kindly man.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.520
A wizard.

08:02.680 --> 08:04.120
With hair.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.160
A long silvery beard.

08:06.160 --> 08:07.440
What's his name?

08:07.440 --> 08:10.400
Larsson. Yeah, Wizard Larsson.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.080
And you can't miss him,

08:12.080 --> 08:14.840
because of his
big old dragon tattoo.

08:14.840 --> 08:17.240
How exciting. Mm.

08:17.240 --> 08:18.920
And what happens on the third layer?

08:18.920 --> 08:22.640
Oh, you know, nothing much, really.

08:27.640 --> 08:29.520
Unless you like unicorns.

08:37.680 --> 08:40.760
Oh! Thomas.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.640
What are you doing?

08:42.640 --> 08:44.280
Forgive me.

08:44.280 --> 08:46.400
I required a place
to gather my thoughts,

08:46.400 --> 08:49.040
to calm the turbulence in my head.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.840
I know. Today's been hard,

08:51.840 --> 08:53.680
but I think if we just try
to stay busy...

08:53.680 --> 08:55.760
It's all just so senseless.

08:55.760 --> 08:59.040
Mm. To be taken at random,
without warning.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.480
Yeah, it's a lot to deal with.

09:01.480 --> 09:03.480
And Mary was very special.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.040
I still have so much to give.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.080
So much yet to create.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.560
Oh, you're talking about yourself.

09:09.560 --> 09:12.360
If I am to be next,

09:12.360 --> 09:16.040
I want you to know that I love you.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.440
Yes, Thomas. I'm aware of that.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.040
And however hard it might be,

09:21.040 --> 09:23.400
I want you to be happy.

09:23.400 --> 09:25.320
Move on.

09:25.320 --> 09:27.320
Marry another.

09:27.320 --> 09:29.680
I am, of course,
already married... to Mike.

09:29.680 --> 09:32.400
Good. You must.

09:32.400 --> 09:34.040
I am.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.280
Good.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.640
And the party will be in here.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.600
Oh.

09:41.640 --> 09:43.520
Oh, wow.

09:43.520 --> 09:47.280
Brave of you to have so much china
at a children's party.

09:47.280 --> 09:50.200
Yes, well, that's... that's
because... absolutely because...

09:50.200 --> 09:53.240
Because... Because it's
a Mad Hatter's tea party. Yeah.

09:53.240 --> 09:55.680
Is it? It is. Yes. Yeah.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.840
Wow. Amazing.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.080
I'm Alison. Hi.

09:59.080 --> 10:02.720
Oh, I see.
Kids' party, is it? Yeah.

10:02.720 --> 10:04.000
Cool. Cool.

10:04.000 --> 10:06.240
Just remember to keep
an adults-only area.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.520
Pop a bit of go-go juice
in one of the teapots

10:08.520 --> 10:09.800
and... boom!

10:09.800 --> 10:14.240
So, yeah, so we're going to put
their juice in the teapots.

10:14.240 --> 10:16.360
It's gonna be great. Yeah. Yes.

10:16.360 --> 10:18.040
Do you want to have
a look at the tables?

10:18.040 --> 10:20.880
Oh, yeah, please. Thank you.
Thanks, Julian. Great idea.

10:20.880 --> 10:23.320
Oh, you're welcome.
Yeah, just help yourself.

10:23.320 --> 10:26.160
Ideas guy here
just hands 'em out for free!

10:26.160 --> 10:28.360
This is just like
the Cabinet in '91.

10:28.360 --> 10:30.440
"Let's invade Iraq," they said.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.520
"Hmm, what shall we call it?"
they asked.

10:32.520 --> 10:34.840
I know! Operation Desert Storm!

10:34.840 --> 10:36.520
Was I credited? No, I was not, sir.

10:36.520 --> 10:38.280
Did I get a knighthood?
No, I did not, sir.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.680
Did that berk from the Treasury

10:39.680 --> 10:41.960
I mentioned it to in the bar
get one? Yes, he did, sir.

10:41.960 --> 10:45.080
Well, I ask you, what a business!

10:45.080 --> 10:46.480
Wow.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.840
These guys were just asking
about the tea.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.640
The kids' birthday tea.
For the kids.

10:52.640 --> 10:56.000
And I said we've got that covered.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.880
We have not got that covered.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.080
Hmm...

10:59.080 --> 11:00.920
It's all vol-au-vents and blinis.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.160
And what are we going to do
with all this wine?

11:03.160 --> 11:05.240
You can't give wine
to children, Alison -

11:05.240 --> 11:07.120
even I know that.

11:07.120 --> 11:08.600
Unless you live in France.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.560
Right, I have to get
some food for the kids. OK.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.600
What do kids eat?

11:15.600 --> 11:17.320
Beige.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.200
Pat's got some ideas. I'll text you.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.640
Yep. OK.

11:20.640 --> 11:22.800
Trust me, Alison.
If it's a children's party,

11:22.800 --> 11:25.600
you want all the food to be
the same colour as my shirt.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.680
And shorts and socks.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.680
We're talking cocktail sausages,

11:29.680 --> 11:31.640
pork pies, Scotch eggs.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.800
Oh, Scotch eggs!

11:33.800 --> 11:37.800
And let's not forget
the piece of resistance -

11:37.800 --> 11:39.360
qu-wich Lorraine.

11:39.360 --> 11:42.120
Yes, yes, a complete sea of beige.

11:42.120 --> 11:44.040
But with one exception - jelly.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.120
Oh! Yeah. That can be
as bright as you like.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.280
Preferably a colour
not found in nature.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.480
Thank you, Pat.

11:51.480 --> 11:53.760
And thank you for
taking care of Kitty.

11:53.760 --> 11:55.240
It can't be easy.

11:57.280 --> 11:59.840
She is finding it
hard to process.

11:59.840 --> 12:02.120
But, you know, I'm just...
I'm just trying

12:02.120 --> 12:05.040
to explain it in a way
she understands.

12:05.040 --> 12:06.800
Hmm. Yeah. Right.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.040
And I guess try not
to give her, like, false hope.

12:11.160 --> 12:12.360
Yeah...

12:15.440 --> 12:17.200
Yes, please. Silver car.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.480
In she comes.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.680
Keeping it going.
And going this way.

12:20.680 --> 12:23.280
We're going this way.
Keep it coming in.

12:23.280 --> 12:25.400
I like that. And square it off.

12:25.400 --> 12:28.640
Keep it coming. Keep it coming.
We are not going that way.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.600
We are coming this way.

12:30.600 --> 12:33.240
Bring it in, nice and square. Hi.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.680
And halt there.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.200
Huh. Hmm.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.560
Carry on.

12:38.560 --> 12:40.480
And now on ITV,

12:40.480 --> 12:43.320
is it OK to wear joggers
at your own wedding?

12:43.320 --> 12:45.360
Hmm. Not sure about that.

12:45.360 --> 12:47.400
But let's find out what
those Loose Women think.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.680
Oh. Mary will want to watch this.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.040
Mary?

12:51.040 --> 12:52.520
I say, Mary!

12:52.520 --> 12:54.520
The Loose Women are on.

12:54.520 --> 12:55.840
Mary!

12:59.640 --> 13:01.000
Oh, Mary.

13:05.640 --> 13:07.320
Alison? Yeah, yeah.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.800
Just wondering when
you're going to be doing food.

13:09.800 --> 13:11.480
Oh, yeah, yeah. Erm...

13:13.200 --> 13:14.400
Really soon.

13:14.400 --> 13:15.800
Great.

13:17.320 --> 13:20.400
They're noisy, aren't they?
Never really got used to that.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.560
My parents prefer to say
"full of life".

13:22.560 --> 13:23.840
Yeah.

13:23.840 --> 13:27.840
Well, they are. So full of life.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.360
And so precious.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.280
Cos life is precious, isn't it?

13:33.560 --> 13:35.120
Yes, it is. Yep.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.480
Yeah, you've got to really grab
hold of it with both hands,

13:37.480 --> 13:40.040
don't you? You have to enjoy it
while you can,

13:40.040 --> 13:43.360
cos it can all just be
snatched away so quickly.

13:47.720 --> 13:49.040
Erm, shall we?

13:51.560 --> 13:52.720
Alison?

13:52.720 --> 13:54.520
Hey! Watch it, hippy.

13:54.520 --> 13:57.920
Calm your anger, sir. I'm not angry!

13:57.920 --> 13:59.000
Look at this teapot.

13:59.000 --> 14:00.560
It's in completely the wrong place.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.720
Alison! Going to move it.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.920
I have so much to write
while I still can.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.160
I need your help...

14:05.160 --> 14:06.920
Stand aside, Thorne. Stand aside.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.600
Alison, I need a new task.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.240
Oh...

14:11.240 --> 14:12.320
Blame the teapot, not me.

14:12.320 --> 14:13.720
Hey, Alison!

14:13.720 --> 14:16.120
Quickly now. Come along.
I need occupation.

14:16.120 --> 14:17.720
It was just a teacup.
It's all right.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.840
Alison... Alison!

14:19.840 --> 14:22.360
Mary's gone. She's actually gone!

14:22.360 --> 14:23.960
What are we to do?

14:23.960 --> 14:26.560
Come on, then.
Please, Alison.

14:26.560 --> 14:29.440
Come on. Captain, OK, I need you to
gather all of the ghosts

14:29.440 --> 14:31.200
in the library.
Emergency meeting. Now.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.440
Excellent. Roger all that.

14:33.440 --> 14:37.920
All right, Thorne, come along.
Quickly now. Fanny, come along.

14:37.920 --> 14:40.120
No time to wait. Julian? Robin?

14:40.120 --> 14:43.040
Mike. Can you take over?
Oh, but I'm on logistics.

14:43.040 --> 14:46.360
We agreed. I know, I know, I know,
but I think they need my help, Mike.

14:46.360 --> 14:49.720
They're not coping
with Mary moving on.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.320
What about you?

14:53.720 --> 14:56.320
All right, I'm not sure I can
take on all these kids, but, yeah.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.680
Thank you. Yeah, sure.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.360
Oh, hey. Erm...

15:01.360 --> 15:02.920
Oh, hi, Mike.
Sorry, just wondering -

15:02.920 --> 15:04.520
the kids are getting a bit restless.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.400
You did book an entertainer,
didn't you?

15:06.400 --> 15:08.360
Oh, yeah, yeah, I did. Yeah.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.400
I did!

15:10.400 --> 15:12.360
Baddabing, baddaboom.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.440
Hello, Dolly!

15:15.440 --> 15:16.920
Oh, no.

15:16.920 --> 15:18.800
Take me to the Golden Girls.

15:20.240 --> 15:23.240
So, yeah, the party
has sort of changed.

15:23.240 --> 15:26.880
Hey, Mikey, Mikey, Mikey,
relax! I got this.

15:26.880 --> 15:29.520
Hey, what does it say on my website?

15:29.520 --> 15:31.200
That you're 41?

15:31.200 --> 15:32.960
No event too big or too small.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.600
Whoo! I am pumped.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.000
Hey, it's showtime!

15:41.720 --> 15:44.920
Are you
joking? It's a kids' party.

15:44.920 --> 15:46.840
Is it? I can't do that. No way.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.800
Please, Tony, I need this.

15:48.800 --> 15:52.960
There's two little birthday girls
out there. I can't let them down.

15:52.960 --> 15:54.360
There's a buffet.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.960
All you can eat.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.520
And I'll pay you extra.

15:57.520 --> 15:59.360
All right, you had me at buffet.

15:59.360 --> 16:00.800
But... I also need the money.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.240
Right.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.280
It's showtime.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.080
It's showtime!

16:08.200 --> 16:10.640
Woohoo! OK, kids...

16:12.960 --> 16:15.720
We need to talk about
the elephant in the room.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.120
What?!

16:17.120 --> 16:20.240
No-one is coping
with Mary's passing.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.240
Wait, there's no elephant!

16:22.240 --> 16:26.160
Now I'm missing a party
and the dancing and...

16:26.160 --> 16:29.000
That's what I mean.
I know that you're all ghosts,

16:29.000 --> 16:31.720
and I know it's not the end
of Mary's life,

16:31.720 --> 16:33.960
but it is the end of her afterlife.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.160
And... And...

16:35.160 --> 16:37.960
If I may, Alison? Erm, yeah, Kitty.

16:37.960 --> 16:40.360
You must not trouble yourself.

16:40.360 --> 16:43.200
Mary is watching us now.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.360
She is at the second layer.

16:45.360 --> 16:48.280
Soon the wise Wizard Larsson
will find her

16:48.280 --> 16:50.480
and escort her
to the Gates of Herbert,

16:50.480 --> 16:52.440
where the unicorns await.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.040
I do think we need closure, though.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.360
We... We need a memorial service.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.920
Thomas, I thought
you could write a eulogy.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.080
A eulogy!

17:07.080 --> 17:10.480
Oh, yes, it would be an honour
to use my gifts to help.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.200
Yes, we must mourn.

17:12.200 --> 17:13.680
Exactly. Yeah.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.920
Well, in which case,
you should be wearing black.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.720
You should shroud yourself in crepe
for at least two years.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.080
It's only right.
And we'll need guns. What?

17:21.080 --> 17:23.120
When George died...
Lots of guns. For the salute.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.480
...we dressed accordingly.
I shall practise gun noises.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.920
Perhaps we should sing a hymn.
Or chant to the unicorns

17:27.920 --> 17:30.120
and give thanks
to Wizard Larsson for his help.

17:30.120 --> 17:32.160
Mm-hm. Sorry.

17:32.160 --> 17:34.280
Unless you know where
the ACTUAL shotgun is. Do you?

17:34.280 --> 17:36.080
I'll go and look for it.
I'll report back.

17:36.080 --> 17:38.120
Yes, please. Do we need...?

17:38.120 --> 17:40.280
I mean, look at this.
Come on!

17:40.280 --> 17:43.000
Is it too much to ask
for alphabetical order?!

17:43.000 --> 17:44.720
A spray of orchids in each room.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.560
Do you think it should rhyme?
Black armbands for the footmen.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.160
Can we all just meet
in the orchard at three?

17:50.160 --> 17:51.520
And, erm...

17:51.520 --> 17:52.960
It's not even in order.

17:52.960 --> 17:55.000
...I'll sort out the rest by myself.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.280
Come on.

18:21.280 --> 18:23.640
Downtown? Yes, thank you.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.000
OK, birthday girls.

18:26.000 --> 18:28.080
Nah...

18:28.080 --> 18:29.320
Can't have that.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.320
Next time, kids,
we'll just raise the roof, huh?

18:31.320 --> 18:33.520
I don't know any Lady Gaga.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.360
Perfect.

18:44.120 --> 18:46.240
Nah. Nah.

18:46.240 --> 18:47.720
Oh, yeah.

18:47.720 --> 18:49.560
And when she's crossed that bridge

18:49.560 --> 18:52.440
to the Castle of Tolstoy,
Pat, what next?

18:52.440 --> 18:53.720
Kitty...

18:55.520 --> 18:57.240
You know,

18:57.240 --> 19:00.280
there are only a certain number
of layers.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.800
Oh.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.280
And when Mary gets to the castle,

19:05.280 --> 19:06.760
her journey is over.

19:07.800 --> 19:11.120
She has found Ludlum
and the Orb of Holcroft.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.640
She... She can't get back
to us, can she?

19:18.040 --> 19:19.320
No, Kitty.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.640
But she is at peace.

19:35.680 --> 19:37.760
Gentle knock.

19:37.760 --> 19:40.640
Thomas. I thought we said three,
in the orchard?

19:40.640 --> 19:41.960
Yes.

19:41.960 --> 19:44.320
Well, I've prepared the eulogy,

19:44.320 --> 19:46.520
and I hoped
I might hear your thoughts

19:46.520 --> 19:49.280
before I perform to the others.

19:49.280 --> 19:51.080
Yeah. OK.

19:55.800 --> 19:59.320
I first met Mary
after I'd been fatally shot

19:59.320 --> 20:00.920
in the abdomen.

20:00.920 --> 20:03.520
It was a difficult time for me,
of course.

20:03.520 --> 20:07.320
I was still grappling with
a burning personal betrayal.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.360
I was certainly melancholic for a...

20:09.360 --> 20:10.680
Thomas...

20:10.680 --> 20:11.880
Yes?

20:11.880 --> 20:15.000
I think you've probably made this
all this about yourself...

20:15.000 --> 20:16.240
...again.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.320
Have I?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.200
Yes, I suppose I have.

20:21.200 --> 20:22.680
Damn your eyes, Thorne!

20:23.720 --> 20:25.360
Forgive me.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.400
But how do I...?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.000
I know what to do.

20:35.440 --> 20:37.360
But I need your help.

20:41.320 --> 20:42.920
Thank you, Button House.

20:42.920 --> 20:46.520
You've been a great audience.
Goodnight!

20:50.880 --> 20:52.160
Tough crowd.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.520
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:56.520 --> 20:58.880
boys and girls,

20:58.880 --> 21:00.360
prepare yourselves for fun...

21:00.360 --> 21:01.440
...and treats!

21:01.440 --> 21:04.480
Make way for the Mad...

21:04.480 --> 21:06.120
...Hatter!

21:07.960 --> 21:10.360
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

21:12.440 --> 21:13.480
Yes!

21:13.480 --> 21:16.400
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Who likes sweets?

21:16.400 --> 21:19.000
Yeah!

21:19.000 --> 21:21.800
I can't hear you.
I said, who likes sweets?

21:21.800 --> 21:23.680
Yeah!

21:26.880 --> 21:28.440
Thank you all for coming.

21:29.640 --> 21:33.640
I realise that today
we've all been running away

21:33.640 --> 21:36.120
from the one thing
that unites us all...

21:37.280 --> 21:41.520
...the one thing that I think
we've all been feeling -

21:41.520 --> 21:42.840
grief.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.480
I know we all have different ideas

21:47.480 --> 21:49.080
about what we should do,

21:49.080 --> 21:54.240
but I thought we should take
some time to remember Mary.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.800
Thomas was going to say
a few words.

21:59.320 --> 22:03.320
I thought that words could help
us make sense of all this.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.360
But I was wrong.

22:07.600 --> 22:11.080
So, instead, I've asked Alison
to gather some items

22:11.080 --> 22:13.160
to help us remember Mary.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.040
Oh! I know. Yeah.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.680
Our Loose Women.

22:27.040 --> 22:28.760
A photograph of Michael?

22:28.760 --> 22:30.920
Yes, well, she was
very, ahem, fond of...

22:30.920 --> 22:33.400
She fancied him. She fancied him.

22:33.400 --> 22:36.200
Erm... I hope you like the basket.

22:36.200 --> 22:37.360
I made it last year,

22:37.360 --> 22:39.360
according to Mary's instructions.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.640
Five potatoes high.

22:41.640 --> 22:43.400
Five potatoes high.

22:44.680 --> 22:48.640
Erm, I thought it best
not to have a cremation.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.480
But, erm, we could bury this
beneath the tree.

22:52.480 --> 22:55.920
And we could come and remember her,

22:55.920 --> 23:00.360
or pray or whatever it is
you believe in.

23:00.360 --> 23:03.880
Well, thank you, Alison.
I shall say a prayer for Mary.

23:03.880 --> 23:07.200
And you don't have to wear black,
by the way. Thank you.

23:07.200 --> 23:09.960
Doesn't suit you. Fine.

23:09.960 --> 23:13.840
Good. Well, lots to do, so, erm...

23:13.840 --> 23:15.040
Captain. Yeah?

23:15.040 --> 23:18.840
It's OK. You don't have to be
busy any more.

23:18.840 --> 23:20.560
I understand.

23:20.560 --> 23:23.360
I mean, we all do. Yes, but...

23:24.400 --> 23:25.760
But if I stop, then...

23:25.760 --> 23:28.640
I know. I know. It's OK.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.800
And, Julian...

23:32.840 --> 23:36.280
You know, today reminds me
of when Maggie's cat died.

23:37.960 --> 23:41.200
She was so angry, we had to hide
the nuclear launch codes.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.880
I'm not angry with you lot.

23:43.880 --> 23:48.320
It's a perfectly normal reaction,
Julian. Mm.

23:48.320 --> 23:52.000
Hey! What you all doing,
long faces?

23:52.000 --> 23:53.840
Party's getting real good in there.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.840
Robin, what's wrong with you, actually?

23:58.840 --> 24:00.880
I mean, are you not affected
by this at all?

24:03.320 --> 24:06.240
I've been around a long time.

24:06.240 --> 24:08.280
Like, a really long time.

24:09.920 --> 24:12.280
I've seen
this happen so much.

24:13.760 --> 24:16.440
I can't do this every time.

24:16.440 --> 24:17.720
The pain...

24:21.320 --> 24:24.600
...I deal with it in my own way.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.880
Perhaps we could have
a moment's silence.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.280
For Mary.

24:56.400 --> 24:59.840
You know, I think
Mary would want us

24:59.840 --> 25:02.720
to have some fun, too. Eh?

25:02.720 --> 25:05.200
Yeah.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.800
Gangnam Style
by PSY

25:22.240 --> 25:24.040
Oh?

25:24.040 --> 25:25.640
Who thinks they won?

25:25.640 --> 25:26.840
Me!

25:26.840 --> 25:29.040
I can't hear you -
who thinks they won?

25:29.040 --> 25:31.120
Me, me!

25:31.120 --> 25:33.000
You're all winners.
You're all just too good.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.760
Well, now you can just dance.

25:36.720 --> 25:38.480
Yeah, there we go.

25:38.480 --> 25:40.760
Thank you. Oh, hey.

25:40.760 --> 25:42.720
Thank you for taking over.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.200
Course.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.480
I love you. I don't tell you enough.

25:47.480 --> 25:50.120
And what are you talking about?
You're great with kids.

25:50.120 --> 25:51.560
Yeah?

25:51.560 --> 25:52.840
Yeah.

25:55.960 --> 25:57.800
Cake. Hmm?

25:57.800 --> 25:59.480
We didn't replace the birthday cake.

25:59.480 --> 26:01.440
Oh, no, no. Don't worry,
I've got it covered.

26:01.440 --> 26:02.800
OK. Yeah.

26:05.960 --> 26:11.880
# Happy birthday to you! ♪

26:14.880 --> 26:16.720
Who wants cake?

26:16.720 --> 26:18.400
Me!

26:18.400 --> 26:19.680
Me.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.800
Five, six, seven...

26:25.800 --> 26:28.680
No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait. Wait.

26:28.680 --> 26:30.840
Has anybody seen Humphrey? Anyone?

26:30.840 --> 26:33.760
You don't think that...?

26:33.760 --> 26:35.400
Oh, there you all are.

26:35.400 --> 26:36.880
I've been on guard duty.

26:36.880 --> 26:38.280
I didn't fall asleep.

26:38.280 --> 26:40.280
Oh...

26:40.280 --> 26:41.960
I'll tell him.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.960
Erm...

26:43.960 --> 26:46.040
Uh, n-no.

26:46.040 --> 26:48.600
No, I've got this, Katherine.

26:51.520 --> 26:54.120
Humphrey, now... Yeah?

26:54.120 --> 26:57.880
...I'm afraid I have
some rather sad news.

27:05.320 --> 27:07.000
This is what I do...

27:08.400 --> 27:11.080
...every time one of us moves on.

27:12.440 --> 27:13.840
I find them a star.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.400
That's where we go. Whoosh!

27:19.760 --> 27:21.120
Back to the stars.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.280
Clarence.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.160
Godric.

27:29.160 --> 27:31.120
Elizabeth.

27:31.120 --> 27:32.480
William.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.400
William!

27:36.640 --> 27:39.040
Annie.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.440
Which one's Mary?

27:41.440 --> 27:44.240
How about that one?

27:45.440 --> 27:47.360
Brightest in the sky.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.880
That is International Space Station.

27:50.880 --> 27:52.640
Cool. Cool.

27:56.040 --> 27:57.920
That one.

27:57.920 --> 28:00.600
Has a twinkle. Hmm.

28:00.600 --> 28:01.800
That one.

28:06.680 --> 28:08.040
Goodbye, Mary.
