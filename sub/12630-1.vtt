WEBVTT

00:00.333 --> 00:03.802
Orks group

00:43.443 --> 00:45.144
yes!

00:51.751 --> 00:53.318
Yeah!

00:53.386 --> 00:55.421
Whoo!

01:03.930 --> 01:06.999
Man: Lucille,
get your brother.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.535
Think fast!

01:10.937 --> 01:13.138
Boy: Ah, here it comes.

01:13.206 --> 01:14.506
I'm striking him out this time.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.508
Give it to me.

01:25.819 --> 01:27.653
Ooh, swing and a miss.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.221
What's there to do in Utah?

01:29.289 --> 01:30.989
Same stuff they do here,

01:31.057 --> 01:33.492
except much slower.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.593
Hey, good luck trying to find

01:34.661 --> 01:36.195
a kosher hot dog in that state.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.429
Yeah.

01:37.497 --> 01:38.430
Come on, give it to me.

01:38.498 --> 01:39.598
Boy: Here it comes.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.537
All right, you got this one!

01:45.605 --> 01:48.207
Strike you out.
Here it comes.
Here it comes.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.575
Ooh, nice hit!

01:49.642 --> 01:51.944
That's out of here!

01:52.011 --> 01:54.413
Bet the only jazz they have
is the basketball team.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.814
Come on, switch it up.

01:58.351 --> 01:59.718
That sounds bleak.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.520
I'm happy it's you
and not me going to Utah.

02:01.588 --> 02:04.823
Thanks.

02:06.092 --> 02:07.126
All right, come on.
Ready for this?

02:07.193 --> 02:08.127
Yeah!

02:08.193 --> 02:09.294
Ok, here we go.

02:09.362 --> 02:11.597
All right, give me a target.
Come on!

02:16.302 --> 02:18.170
They got a music program
at this school?

02:18.204 --> 02:21.039
Get this, their band
plays at football games.

02:21.107 --> 02:22.574
Whoa, hold me back.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.877
Hey, who wants an egg cream?
I'm buying.

02:24.944 --> 02:26.578
Oh, you know I'm in.

02:26.646 --> 02:27.980
I don't know what happened.

02:28.047 --> 02:29.915
You know,
i was going along
perfectly happy.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.850
My dad gets one phone call,

02:31.918 --> 02:33.452
my life turns into
an after-school special.

02:33.520 --> 02:35.587
That'll be $8.00, kids.

02:35.655 --> 02:36.588
Bummer.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.357
Yeah, you can say that again.

02:38.424 --> 02:40.092
Bummer.
Bummer.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.093
Oh, bummer.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.728
Bummer.
Bummer.

02:42.795 --> 02:44.796
That's it. You guys
are going down.

02:44.864 --> 02:46.798
We're gonna miss you, man.

03:12.225 --> 03:15.160
Man: Up there
on the right.

03:15.228 --> 03:16.428
Oh, wow!

03:16.496 --> 03:18.797
Woman: Oh, honey, looks great.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.232
It's huge!

03:20.300 --> 03:23.502
Jace, we're gonna
have to teach you
how to mow a lawn.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.337
This is gonna work
for all of us.

03:25.405 --> 03:27.406
I think this is gonna be great.

03:27.473 --> 03:28.974
Hey.
Good morning.

03:29.042 --> 03:31.743
Um, would you mind putting
that on the front porch?

03:31.811 --> 03:32.744
I'm not sure
where I want it yet.

03:32.812 --> 03:34.880
Yes, ma'am.

03:34.914 --> 03:36.481
Can you take
the drum set upstairs?

03:36.549 --> 03:37.549
You know, the bass drum?

03:37.584 --> 03:39.384
Mover: Yes, ma'am.

03:39.419 --> 03:41.987
There it is, home sweet home.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.956
What do you think?

03:45.391 --> 03:47.459
Oh, wow.

03:47.527 --> 03:49.861
That's nice.
That's much better.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.463
So, what are
we talking about here?

03:51.531 --> 03:52.998
A 6-story castle?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.099
My own private club on the roof?

03:54.167 --> 03:55.100
Close.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.134
Video arcade in the dining room?

03:56.202 --> 03:57.502
Mermaids frolicking in the pool?

03:57.570 --> 03:58.737
Oh!

04:00.173 --> 04:02.307
Karl Malone shooting
hoops with you.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.709
Uh...

04:03.776 --> 04:05.143
He's not here anymore, dad.

04:05.211 --> 04:06.511
Or maybe not.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.347
But I did make sure
they put your rim up first.

04:08.414 --> 04:10.215
You want to play some ball?

04:10.283 --> 04:11.717
You're on.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.118
Let's go.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.296
Hey, Jace, you all right?

04:24.364 --> 04:26.765
Yeah, thanks, dad.
I'm fine.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.667
Great.

04:52.425 --> 04:53.859
How you doing?

04:53.926 --> 04:55.294
What's up?

04:55.361 --> 04:57.462
You moving in?

04:57.530 --> 05:00.132
That's the rumor.
Name's Jace.

05:00.199 --> 05:01.800
Vince.

05:05.505 --> 05:07.472
What are you doing?

05:07.540 --> 05:12.277
I was testing.
You're, uh...

05:12.345 --> 05:15.881
You can call me daredevil.

05:15.948 --> 05:18.550
But how'd you know
my hand was there?

05:18.618 --> 05:19.918
Facial vision.

05:19.986 --> 05:22.020
It has to do
with vibrations
in the air.

05:22.088 --> 05:24.389
I can tell
where people are
when they move.

05:32.865 --> 05:34.633
Like bat radar, huh?

05:40.206 --> 05:43.041
Just one of my many superpowers.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.776
Want to shoot some hoops?

05:45.845 --> 05:49.014
No, um...
I was...

05:49.082 --> 05:52.184
I'm not that much into sports.

05:52.218 --> 05:55.487
I'll talk to you later, ok?

05:58.124 --> 05:59.524
Whatever.

06:19.245 --> 06:20.278
Are you sure you don't want me

06:20.346 --> 06:21.780
to take you in
and get you settled?

06:21.848 --> 06:23.648
What am I, in kindergarten?

06:23.716 --> 06:25.951
I'll be fine.
I love you, mom.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.919
Me, too, sweetie.

06:45.204 --> 06:47.038
Here, let me get
the door for you.

06:48.808 --> 06:50.542
Thanks.
Yeah.

06:59.118 --> 07:00.552
Are you ok?

07:00.620 --> 07:01.753
Excuse me?

07:01.821 --> 07:03.655
Do you need any help?

07:03.723 --> 07:05.090
No, I'm all set.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.459
So, you gonna go
to the game on Friday?

07:07.527 --> 07:08.460
What do you say...

07:08.528 --> 07:11.096
Hey, man, are you
blind or something?

07:13.232 --> 07:15.066
Oops, my bad.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.169
Hey, everybody.

07:17.236 --> 07:19.871
Check it out,
a talking side of beef.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.773
What's your name, farm boy?

07:21.841 --> 07:23.909
Ooh, that's one for John,
one for the blind kid.

07:23.976 --> 07:25.410
Yeah, well, I'd...

07:25.478 --> 07:27.546
I'd punch his lights out,
but it looks like...

07:27.613 --> 07:28.880
Somebody already has.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.215
You know that one.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.585
I haven't heard
that one since
like the second grade.

07:33.686 --> 07:35.187
Come on, John boy,

07:35.254 --> 07:36.621
park your cow and take a shot.

07:36.689 --> 07:39.357
Come on, let it go.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.294
Oh!

07:42.361 --> 07:43.562
Where you going?

07:43.629 --> 07:46.131
I gotta go look after the cows.

07:46.199 --> 07:48.233
Ah, funny guy.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.536
Do you always
make friends this easily?

07:51.604 --> 07:53.338
How big was that guy anyway?

07:53.406 --> 07:54.973
Well, not terribly big.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.975
He's just captain
of the football team.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.043
Oops.

07:58.110 --> 07:59.478
And the captain
of the wrestling team.

07:59.545 --> 08:01.046
Major oops.

08:01.113 --> 08:02.314
You know, if you'd agreed
to walk with me,

08:02.381 --> 08:04.015
we could have avoided
this whole thing.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.951
Maybe I just like
doing things
the hard way.

08:06.018 --> 08:07.619
Please, all guys do.

08:07.687 --> 08:09.588
I know.
I have 3 brothers.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.289
So are you Jason newfield?

08:11.357 --> 08:13.258
Jace.
How'd you guess?

08:13.326 --> 08:14.459
I'm Mary Beth rice.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.461
I'm gonna be one
of your readers.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.831
Why, cause
it looks good on your
college application?

08:19.899 --> 08:22.133
No. I'm totally doing it
for the cash.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.669
Catch you later.

08:34.914 --> 08:38.884
Hey! Is this
Mr. kamen's Spanish 2?

08:38.951 --> 08:41.486
Yes, unfortunately.

08:41.554 --> 08:42.754
Let me show you to a seat.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.489
Thank you.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.024
I guess that makes
2 of us stuck here

08:46.092 --> 08:47.425
in never-never land.

08:49.595 --> 08:50.929
So where are you from, dude?

08:50.997 --> 08:53.131
Only the greatest place
in the universe,

08:53.199 --> 08:56.568
New York City.
Thank you very much.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.370
Am I supposed to be impressed?

08:58.437 --> 08:59.738
Obviously.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.274
Jason: Ok...

09:02.341 --> 09:06.278
New kid's comedy
crashes and burns.

09:10.483 --> 09:12.984
Howdy, partner!

09:13.052 --> 09:14.419
Oh, boy.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.489
Jace.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.658
Farm boy.

09:53.559 --> 09:54.759
Ho! Ho! Ho!

09:54.827 --> 09:57.329
Ho! Ho! Ho! Hey!

09:57.396 --> 09:59.531
Hey, who's playing the drums?

09:59.599 --> 10:03.001
That's me, Mr. Wyatt.
Jace newfield.

10:03.069 --> 10:06.871
Jace newfield.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.008
Mr. newfield,
my man!

10:21.754 --> 10:23.054
Wow.

10:24.223 --> 10:27.125
Man, that is interesting,
Mr. newfield.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.793
I had no idea

10:28.861 --> 10:30.228
that bach had written
a drum solo.

10:30.296 --> 10:31.730
Class, did you?

10:31.797 --> 10:33.331
I didn't know that,

10:33.399 --> 10:34.366
but then again, i don't have

10:34.433 --> 10:37.035
your vast musical knowledge.

10:37.103 --> 10:38.470
I was just...
It was a little...

10:38.537 --> 10:41.239
No, I know. You weren't
trying to show off.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.909
You were trying to improve
Johann Sebastian bach.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.911
You know what's amazing is
you are the first person

10:46.979 --> 10:49.681
to be that brilliant
in over 300 years.

10:49.749 --> 10:51.449
Ladies and gentlemen,
a big round of applause

10:51.517 --> 10:53.051
for Mr. Jace newfield!

10:53.119 --> 10:54.519
Yes!

10:54.587 --> 10:55.854
Look, Mr. Wyatt,

10:55.921 --> 10:57.322
it's not that big a deal.

11:00.660 --> 11:04.562
Mr. newfield, please,
do not come into my class

11:04.630 --> 11:07.899
and assume that you are
better than anybody else.

11:07.967 --> 11:09.467
I'm not assuming anything.

11:09.535 --> 11:11.236
Good.

11:11.303 --> 11:13.038
Because if you want
special treatment,

11:13.105 --> 11:15.273
then you go to a special school.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.976
In my class, everyone is
regarded as an equal.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.545
Cool?

11:20.613 --> 11:24.182
I'm sorry, all right.
I j... forget it.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.651
You wouldn't understand.

11:26.719 --> 11:29.087
My guess is I understand
better than anybody.

11:34.093 --> 11:35.293
Mr. Wyatt: Ok...

11:35.361 --> 11:36.895
In case nobody told you,

11:36.962 --> 11:38.363
he's just like you.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.499
Whoa.

11:41.567 --> 11:43.435
Talk about the blind
leading the blind.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.706
See what you did there?
That's funny.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.607
That was a joke.
You're a clown.

11:49.675 --> 11:51.643
If you want to juggle
and sword swallow,

11:51.711 --> 11:53.478
that's next-door.
If you want to make music

11:53.546 --> 11:56.648
and be part of the ensemble,
that's right here.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.049
Are we clear?

11:59.251 --> 12:00.185
Mr. Wyatt: Are we clear?

12:00.252 --> 12:01.186
Crystal.

12:01.253 --> 12:02.587
Good.

12:02.621 --> 12:03.621
All right,

12:03.689 --> 12:05.690
bach, the right way.

12:05.758 --> 12:06.858
And...

12:12.665 --> 12:13.865
Hey, Jace,

12:13.933 --> 12:15.300
awesome playing in there, man.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.535
Hey, Vince.
How's it going?

12:17.570 --> 12:18.770
Maybe you are a superhero.

12:18.838 --> 12:20.472
One meeting,
and you already
recognize my voice?

12:20.539 --> 12:22.307
You know what they say.
Once you lose one sense,

12:22.374 --> 12:24.542
the others kind of kick in
to pick up the slack.

12:24.610 --> 12:25.744
So, you're in
the band, too, huh?

12:25.811 --> 12:26.745
Who do you think
backed you
on the piano?

12:26.812 --> 12:28.947
Hey, wait, wait.
Hold on.

12:30.116 --> 12:31.449
Nice.

12:31.517 --> 12:34.285
So, who's that Wyatt guy?

12:34.353 --> 12:36.254
Well...

12:36.322 --> 12:38.156
He's... hey, good night,
Mr. Wyatt.

12:38.224 --> 12:41.192
Hey, Mr. shu.
Mr. newfield.

12:41.260 --> 12:44.429
Good evening, Mr. Wyatt.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.764
Shoot.

12:45.831 --> 12:46.765
He's cool.

12:46.832 --> 12:47.952
He just don't like surprises.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.100
Great.

12:49.168 --> 12:50.835
So much for music being
my way in around here.

12:50.903 --> 12:53.505
Well, it's kind of never in.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.373
Uhh!
Out of my way, fly.

12:55.441 --> 12:56.374
Sorry for living, Nolan.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.176
You should be.
Come on, John.

12:58.244 --> 13:01.079
Hey, John boy.
I'm shaking already.

13:01.147 --> 13:02.447
You know what?
You're gonna get hurt, kid.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.848
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.317
Don't push it, newfield.

13:06.385 --> 13:07.418
Oh, ok.

13:07.486 --> 13:09.354
You really shouldn't
mess with those guys.

13:09.421 --> 13:10.789
They were messing with me.

13:10.856 --> 13:13.057
So, "fly," huh?

13:13.125 --> 13:14.559
What's the deal with that?

13:14.627 --> 13:16.861
Well, that's what
everybody calls me.

13:16.929 --> 13:18.696
Not exactly a big dude, are you?

13:18.764 --> 13:22.467
I will be.
I'm just behind 5 to 10 years.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.835
So, you walking home?

13:23.869 --> 13:25.270
No. My mom's
driving me.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.305
She's afraid I might
end up in Colorado.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.350
And you're supposed to be blind?

13:39.418 --> 13:40.919
Last year,
my band played
the Christmas show

13:40.986 --> 13:42.420
at rockefeller center.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.888
It was awesome.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.790
Kids were dancing and screaming.

13:45.858 --> 13:49.327
One girl even wanted
my autograph. No lie.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.862
Not here, man.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.363
Band guys are like sea monkeys,

13:52.431 --> 13:53.832
the lowest form of life.

13:53.899 --> 13:55.433
At football games,
it's a good night

13:55.501 --> 13:58.503
if no one throws
empty cups at our heads.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.272
Ugh!

14:01.340 --> 14:03.241
Fly, ball.

14:08.747 --> 14:10.481
Uh, a bounce pass next time.

14:10.549 --> 14:12.750
Yeah, sorry about that.

14:12.818 --> 14:14.552
Forgot you're a blind guy.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.389
So what does a guy have
to do in this joint

14:18.457 --> 14:20.124
to be accepted?

14:20.192 --> 14:22.260
Basically, be a jock.

14:22.328 --> 14:24.662
Great.

14:25.998 --> 14:27.599
Everyone thinks, like,
a letterman's jacket is,

14:27.666 --> 14:29.467
like, king of the world
or something.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.302
It's not gonna help me much.

14:31.370 --> 14:33.504
Man, what are you talking about?

14:33.572 --> 14:34.539
You're 10 times
the basketball player I am,

14:34.607 --> 14:36.341
and you can't even see
what you're doing.

14:37.509 --> 14:38.943
I shouldn't have said that.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.979
Oh, I've heard worse.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.081
Think fast!

14:44.149 --> 14:45.383
Jace: Wait.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.652
I'm confused.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.387
I thought i was the blind guy?

14:49.455 --> 14:51.723
Ha ha.
Very funny,

14:51.790 --> 14:53.591
chuckles.

14:54.760 --> 14:56.127
Come on.

14:56.195 --> 14:57.295
All right, gentlemen,

14:57.363 --> 14:59.230
we're gonna work on the weave.

14:59.298 --> 15:01.065
We'll need 3 groups
at half-court.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.534
Whose birthday is
January to April?

15:03.602 --> 15:04.969
Left side.

15:05.037 --> 15:07.372
May to August?

15:07.439 --> 15:10.141
You're in the middle.
Everybody else on the right.

15:10.209 --> 15:12.744
Jace, Phil rice.

15:12.811 --> 15:14.078
Welcome to homestead.

15:14.146 --> 15:15.346
Thank you.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.714
You might want to use
this time to go

15:16.782 --> 15:18.783
do some homework or something.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.151
No, I can do this.

15:20.185 --> 15:22.186
I used to play basketball
all the time at home.

15:22.254 --> 15:26.157
Not to be rude, but how?

15:26.225 --> 15:28.326
With
a bounce-pass-only rule,

15:28.394 --> 15:30.228
and we need a beeping
backboard so I can tell
where the hoop is.

15:30.296 --> 15:32.797
Well, I'm certainly gonna look
into getting one of those,

15:32.865 --> 15:34.866
but for today
you'll have to sit out.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.435
The bleachers are over here.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.837
Beep, beep.

15:39.905 --> 15:42.073
Thank you!

15:42.141 --> 15:44.309
Here we go, fellas!
Good, crisp passes!

15:45.377 --> 15:46.544
Boy: All right,
let's go!

15:48.347 --> 15:50.381
Boy: Nice.

15:50.416 --> 15:51.416
Coach rice: That's it.

15:51.483 --> 15:52.684
Second boy:
Nice shot, Johnny.

15:52.751 --> 15:57.288
Coach rice: Good job.
Good job.

15:57.356 --> 15:58.923
Shoot like a ute!

15:58.991 --> 16:03.094
That's it.

16:03.162 --> 16:04.529
Mr. kamen: Yeah, boomer?

16:04.596 --> 16:06.564
20, 30, 40...
No, no, no.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.467
<i>In espa</i>

16:09.535 --> 16:12.103
<i>claro.</i>

16:12.171 --> 16:15.173
<i>Trienta, cuarinta, y, uh...</i>

16:15.240 --> 16:16.240
<i>Cinquana.</i>

16:16.308 --> 16:18.576
Yeah, ok.
That's right.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.278
That's there
in the ol' ballpark.

16:20.346 --> 16:23.581
Ok, who wants to try
60, 70, and 80?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.450
Mr. kamen: John?

16:27.553 --> 16:30.588
Uh,<i> sesenta...</i>

16:30.656 --> 16:32.991
<i>Y, uh...</i>

16:33.058 --> 16:35.893
<i>Pinta y Santa Maria?</i>

16:35.961 --> 16:37.962
Mr. kamen, chuckling:
That's cute.

16:38.030 --> 16:39.430
Yeah, Jace.

16:39.498 --> 16:42.433
<i>Sesenta, setenta, y ochenta.</i>

16:42.501 --> 16:44.569
Now that's what
I'm talking about.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.671
<i>Sesenta, setenta, ochenta.
Muy bien.</i>

16:49.141 --> 16:51.142
Jace on recorder: <i>Sesenta,
setenta, y ochenta.</i>

16:51.210 --> 16:53.244
Yeah.
What was that?

16:58.584 --> 17:00.351
Jace:
Remember to e-mail Pete

17:00.419 --> 17:01.819
about that genius girl in math.

17:01.887 --> 17:03.688
Very funny, guys.

17:03.756 --> 17:07.458
Jace: I mean, hello,
get out much?

17:07.526 --> 17:08.925
Talk about living
on planet hillbilly.

17:08.993 --> 17:11.462
Is there a problem, Jace?

17:11.530 --> 17:13.297
Somebody took my tape recorder.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.333
Mr. kamen: Well, whoever
has Jace's recorder

17:15.367 --> 17:17.535
return it to him, please?

17:18.604 --> 17:19.704
Ok, that is the fire bell.

17:19.771 --> 17:20.905
Now, let's take this seriously.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.106
We don't know if it's
a drill or the real thing.

17:22.174 --> 17:24.275
So, please, evacuate as quickly

17:24.343 --> 17:26.676
and as calmly as possible.

17:28.012 --> 17:32.050
Attention, students and faculty,

17:32.084 --> 17:33.384
this is a fire drill.

17:33.452 --> 17:36.721
All students and faculty
must evacuate the premises

17:36.789 --> 17:38.122
at once.

17:38.190 --> 17:41.959
Make your way
to the nearest exit.

17:42.027 --> 17:44.195
Attention, students and faculty,

17:44.263 --> 17:47.565
this is a fire drill.
All students and faculty

17:47.633 --> 17:51.235
must evacuate
the premises at once...

17:58.277 --> 17:59.377
Hey!

18:00.579 --> 18:02.947
This is a fire drill.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.549
All students and faculty

18:04.616 --> 18:05.750
must evacuate
the premises at once.

18:05.784 --> 18:07.952
Hey!
Somebody help me!

18:12.124 --> 18:15.793
Please proceed with caution.

18:17.629 --> 18:19.797
Please proceed with caution.

18:19.865 --> 18:21.265
Boy: Don't keep staring.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.701
For your safety,
monitors will direct you

18:23.769 --> 18:26.671
to designated safety areas.

18:26.738 --> 18:30.475
Please remain there
until further instructions.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.308
Hello, hello.
You're early.

19:39.711 --> 19:41.546
All right,
let the learning begin.

19:41.613 --> 19:43.714
Let's go.
Let's go.

19:43.749 --> 19:44.715
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.

19:44.783 --> 19:46.450
Give me some.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.052
What's up?
Give me some.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.987
Mary Beth: Jace,
are you listening?

19:50.055 --> 19:51.222
Jace: Yeah.

19:51.290 --> 19:54.759
'Cause we only have
a few minutes.

19:54.826 --> 19:55.893
"In the early days
of colonization,

19:55.961 --> 19:57.962
"many Europeans considered
the native Americans

19:58.030 --> 20:00.531
"to be acutely naive
and quite uncivilized.

20:00.599 --> 20:01.966
"In their remarkably
narrow view,

20:02.034 --> 20:04.335
they equated those differences
with inferiority."

20:05.470 --> 20:07.271
Welcome to my world.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.906
What's that supposed to mean?

20:08.941 --> 20:11.209
Oh, yeah, like you
haven't noticed.

20:11.276 --> 20:13.277
People here have no idea
how to deal with me.

20:13.345 --> 20:14.812
Do you know how many times
somebody starts

20:14.880 --> 20:16.781
talking really loud in my face?

20:16.848 --> 20:20.284
Hello, I'm blind, not deaf.

20:20.352 --> 20:22.220
You want to know the truth?

20:22.287 --> 20:23.988
People don't care
that you're blind.

20:24.022 --> 20:26.624
They're turned off
because they think
you're a total snob.

20:27.926 --> 20:29.293
What are you talking about?

20:29.361 --> 20:31.996
All your new yorkers rule stuff,

20:32.064 --> 20:33.130
the Hicksville jokes,

20:33.198 --> 20:34.865
don't you think it
gets really annoying?

20:34.933 --> 20:36.367
Jace: Well, I'm sorry,
but I never wanted

20:36.435 --> 20:37.635
to be here in the first place.

20:37.669 --> 20:38.803
Well, you are here, aren't you?

20:38.870 --> 20:40.271
So you might as well
quit blaming us

20:40.339 --> 20:42.707
and lose the attitude.

20:48.780 --> 20:51.916
Mr. Wyatt: Mr. newfield,
you plan on joining us?

21:07.065 --> 21:08.766
Hey, newfield, why aren't you

21:08.834 --> 21:11.068
out there playing
for the home team?

21:11.136 --> 21:12.803
Oh, I was going to,
but my seeing eye dog

21:12.871 --> 21:14.472
kept pawing
everyone's helmet off.

21:15.741 --> 21:16.841
You're a funny guy.

21:16.908 --> 21:18.009
I don't see you laughing.

21:18.076 --> 21:19.110
Oh, wait!

21:19.177 --> 21:20.244
You're the one who's
supposed to be making

21:20.312 --> 21:21.879
the lame blind jokes.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.416
You know, I would
love a real chance

21:25.484 --> 21:26.484
to take that guy down.

21:26.518 --> 21:29.053
I really would.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.288
Maybe you should
go out for a team.

21:30.322 --> 21:32.456
Please don't make it archery.

21:32.524 --> 21:34.125
Oh, yeah, that's good.
Look out!

21:34.192 --> 21:36.460
I was thinking wrestling.

21:36.528 --> 21:38.696
I'm sorry. I think
she said wrestling.

21:38.764 --> 21:40.531
Can he do that?

21:40.599 --> 21:42.967
Please, don't encourage her.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.335
Why not?

21:44.403 --> 21:45.670
You could go out
for our wrestling team.

21:45.737 --> 21:47.038
My dad's the coach.

21:47.105 --> 21:49.073
He and I went
to the regionals last year

21:49.141 --> 21:50.141
and saw this blind kid

21:50.175 --> 21:52.476
from Denver who won
his weight division.

21:55.681 --> 21:57.782
Are you two looking at me?

21:58.984 --> 22:00.785
Computer: The only special
consideration afforded

22:00.852 --> 22:02.987
the sightless
challenge competitor is

22:03.055 --> 22:05.556
that they and their opponents
begin each match

22:05.590 --> 22:08.059
in full contact position,

22:08.126 --> 22:10.861
although each contestant
may subsequently move

22:10.929 --> 22:12.897
and change
the starting position.

22:12.964 --> 22:15.499
As long as there is
some kind of contact

22:15.567 --> 22:17.001
between the 2 contestants,

22:17.069 --> 22:18.903
the wrestling continues.

22:18.970 --> 22:20.271
Once contact is broken,

22:20.339 --> 22:22.573
the referee must blow
the whistle

22:22.641 --> 22:24.308
and reestablish contact...

22:24.376 --> 22:26.143
Mary Beth?

22:26.211 --> 22:27.278
Ok, I'll do it.

22:27.346 --> 22:29.680
All other rules governing
the national title...

22:29.748 --> 22:31.716
Ok, stop laughing.

22:31.783 --> 22:33.617
Stop...
I...

22:35.253 --> 22:38.556
Stop laughing.
Hello?

22:40.992 --> 22:42.259
How did I get roped into this?

22:42.327 --> 22:44.228
Come on, fly.
It'll be good for you.

22:44.296 --> 22:45.563
Wrestling is the one sport

22:45.630 --> 22:46.797
where the little dudes
are just as valuable

22:46.865 --> 22:47.965
as the big monsters.

22:48.033 --> 22:49.300
Yeah, but the little dudes

22:49.368 --> 22:51.836
get eaten by the big monsters.

22:55.073 --> 22:57.341
Hey, coach?

22:57.409 --> 22:59.443
Hiya, Jace.

22:59.511 --> 23:00.578
Who's your friend?

23:00.645 --> 23:01.579
Vince shu.

23:01.646 --> 23:02.913
You can call me fly,
everyone does.

23:02.981 --> 23:04.749
Good to meet you.

23:04.816 --> 23:07.418
Word is you guys
want to join the team.

23:07.486 --> 23:08.552
Well, not exactly...

23:08.620 --> 23:11.422
Absolutely, sir.
We are very keen.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.290
Keen, huh?

23:13.358 --> 23:14.759
Well, have you ever wrestled?

23:14.826 --> 23:16.460
A little with my dad.

23:16.528 --> 23:18.229
Well, starting from scratch,
i mean, it would take

23:18.296 --> 23:19.530
an incredible amount
of hard work.

23:19.598 --> 23:22.633
Great!
I love hard work.

23:23.735 --> 23:24.935
Fly?

23:25.003 --> 23:27.037
Yeah, what he said.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.674
Jace, do you mind me asking

23:30.742 --> 23:32.877
why you even think
you'd want to try this?

23:32.944 --> 23:35.813
Just looking for a way
to compete around here, coach.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.315
All right.

23:42.954 --> 23:47.057
These are some tapes
from our matches last year.

23:47.125 --> 23:49.093
I want you guys
to watch them and...

23:49.161 --> 23:52.229
Fly, why don't you
describe the moves to Jace,

23:52.297 --> 23:53.397
the major action,

23:53.465 --> 23:54.832
and you guys come back
and see me next week.

23:54.900 --> 23:56.700
If you're still interested,
we'll work something out.

23:56.768 --> 23:57.935
Questions?

23:59.070 --> 24:00.404
Approximately, what are the odds

24:00.472 --> 24:02.640
of me getting smushed?

24:02.707 --> 24:04.675
Thanks, coach.

24:04.709 --> 24:06.477
Fly.

24:06.545 --> 24:07.978
Oh, funny guy.

24:08.046 --> 24:09.513
See you next week!

24:11.950 --> 24:13.150
I don't understand.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.653
Wrestling just seems
so gross, so...

24:15.720 --> 24:16.921
Sweaty.

24:16.988 --> 24:19.356
Mom, everybody does
some sport around here.

24:19.424 --> 24:20.357
Why fight it?

24:20.425 --> 24:21.625
Since when do you do things

24:21.660 --> 24:23.561
just because
everybody else
is doing it?

24:23.628 --> 24:25.229
That's never been who you are.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.865
It's like I told you,
except for when I'm with fly,

24:27.933 --> 24:29.934
I'm either the blind guy,
or I'm invisible.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.502
Tom, don't just
sit there. Help me.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.704
I... i think
he should do it.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.040
Haven't we always told him

24:36.107 --> 24:38.108
he could do whatever
he puts his mind to,
right?

24:38.176 --> 24:42.313
So why should
this wrestling be
any different?

24:42.347 --> 24:43.747
Because it sounds dangerous.

24:43.815 --> 24:46.183
Mom, my whole life

24:46.251 --> 24:48.452
is dangerous.

24:48.520 --> 24:49.760
Just walking out the front door

24:49.788 --> 24:50.988
is dangerous.

24:51.056 --> 24:53.591
It doesn't mean
i should sit
in my room and hide.

25:03.034 --> 25:04.268
First off, promise me
you didn't forge

25:04.336 --> 25:06.237
your mom's signature
on this waiver.

25:06.304 --> 25:07.671
If it's signed
neatly on the line,

25:07.739 --> 25:10.274
you can pretty much
guarantee it wasn't me.

25:11.776 --> 25:15.279
All right... 143.

25:15.347 --> 25:16.347
That could work for us.

25:16.381 --> 25:17.581
Right now,
it's Luke Nolan's spot,

25:17.649 --> 25:20.484
but we've got nobody in backup.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.086
Mr. shu...

25:26.591 --> 25:29.627
103.

25:29.694 --> 25:31.629
That weight class is open.

25:32.964 --> 25:34.832
All right, here's the deal.

25:34.900 --> 25:36.100
Anybody's welcome
to work out with us,

25:36.167 --> 25:37.134
but if you commit, i expect you

25:37.168 --> 25:38.469
to show up regularly.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.104
Now, if you want to earn
the right to compete

25:40.171 --> 25:42.006
in a league meet,
you have to win

25:42.073 --> 25:43.440
your weight class
in a wrestle-off

25:43.508 --> 25:45.442
which I hold every 2 to 3 weeks.

25:45.510 --> 25:46.510
Any questions?

25:46.578 --> 25:48.345
Got it.

25:48.413 --> 25:49.580
If you guys really want
to try this,

25:49.648 --> 25:51.982
be at the gym
after school Monday.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.117
We'll see what you got.

25:53.184 --> 25:55.486
Thanks, coach.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.954
Yes!

25:58.023 --> 26:00.391
No.

26:00.458 --> 26:01.392
Fly?

26:01.459 --> 26:02.393
No.

26:02.460 --> 26:03.627
Come on, fly.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.415
All right, everybody to
the south end of the mat!

26:24.482 --> 26:26.717
Freshmen, that's on my right.

26:26.785 --> 26:27.718
Sorry, coach.

26:27.786 --> 26:29.887
Yeah, sorry.

26:29.955 --> 26:33.223
Ok, shot drill on my whistle.

26:40.398 --> 26:43.367
Luke, 25 bucks says
the gimp and the wimp

26:43.435 --> 26:44.435
don't last 2 weeks.

26:44.469 --> 26:45.502
Luke: You're on.

26:45.570 --> 26:47.137
Coach rice:
Chest over knees!

26:47.205 --> 26:48.572
Watch yourself there, Jace.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.876
Keep good head position, fly!

26:52.944 --> 26:55.879
Bottom man, sit out.
Top man, chop.

26:55.947 --> 26:59.216
Bottom, sit.
Top, chop.

26:59.284 --> 27:02.286
Tuck your elbow.
Hip-heist.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.089
Top man, follow his hips.

27:05.156 --> 27:06.223
Uhh!

27:06.291 --> 27:07.858
Dude, what was that?!

27:07.926 --> 27:09.994
Oh, man. You ok?

27:10.061 --> 27:11.762
No, you headbutted me
in my nose.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.063
You probably broke it.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.571
Coach rice:
Take it easy.
Settle down.

27:14.633 --> 27:16.734
Hey, good call, coach,
bringin' some guy in here

27:16.801 --> 27:19.169
who can't even see
what he's doin'.
Thanks a lot.

27:19.237 --> 27:21.538
That's enough, Mike.
Just get some ice.

27:21.606 --> 27:23.774
Don't worry
about it, Jace.
Accidents happen.

27:23.808 --> 27:26.210
Especially when
you hire the handicapped.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.379
Let's get back to the drill.

27:28.446 --> 27:31.749
Concentrate on your technique.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.851
Referee's position, Jace.

27:36.521 --> 27:38.722
When you sit out,
don't extend
your head back.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.058
It throws your balance off, ok?

27:41.126 --> 27:42.126
Ok.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.827
Ready? Go!

27:44.963 --> 27:46.296
Good.

27:49.267 --> 27:51.468
Perfect.
Let's do it again.

27:53.905 --> 27:56.573
Pressure first, fly,
pressure first.

27:56.641 --> 27:58.942
Watch your hip angle, Tim.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.713
What's your favorite
nursery rhyme...
"3 blind mice"?

28:02.781 --> 28:04.148
Just do this.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.816
Big third eye blind fan,
are you?

28:05.884 --> 28:07.651
Or is it blind melon?

28:07.719 --> 28:09.453
Uhh!

28:09.487 --> 28:11.922
Quit it, freak!
Get off of me!

28:13.725 --> 28:15.592
Hey!
That's enough!

28:19.531 --> 28:21.765
Luke, knock it off!

28:27.806 --> 28:30.441
If you got
aggression to work out,
get a punching bag.

28:30.508 --> 28:32.509
This is wrestling,
not street brawling.

28:32.577 --> 28:34.144
And whether you were
provoked or not,

28:34.212 --> 28:35.979
I'm not gonna have
one of my guys get hurt

28:36.047 --> 28:37.381
just because you can't
control your temper.

28:37.449 --> 28:38.949
The guy
was tryin' to...
what?

28:39.017 --> 28:41.251
He was what?

28:41.319 --> 28:43.053
Luke...

28:50.562 --> 28:53.030
Look, wrestling
is not just about
brute strength.

28:53.098 --> 28:55.132
It's about intelligence, Jace.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.700
Now, you've got a good brain,

28:56.768 --> 28:59.336
so why don't you start using it?

28:59.404 --> 29:00.604
Ok?

29:00.672 --> 29:02.840
Are we done?

29:13.017 --> 29:15.119
So, how is wrestling going?

29:15.186 --> 29:17.521
It's not like I'm in
any danger to making it
into an actual meet.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.923
I'm basically there
to be Luke Nolan's
tackling dummy.

29:19.991 --> 29:21.825
Step.
Thank you.

29:21.893 --> 29:23.327
Our first scrimmage
is on Monday.

29:23.394 --> 29:25.562
The wasatch cowboys.
I know.

29:25.630 --> 29:26.964
The wasatch what's-its?

29:27.031 --> 29:28.165
Cowboys.

29:28.233 --> 29:31.135
Ha. Cowboys.
How perfect is that?

29:31.202 --> 29:34.271
Does their gym
have a hitching post
out front?

29:34.339 --> 29:36.874
What, do their uniforms
come with ten-gallon hats?

29:36.941 --> 29:38.742
Hey, careful. That is
sounding an awful lot

29:38.777 --> 29:40.911
like the sarcastic Jace
that you promised
to stifle.

29:40.979 --> 29:43.180
Sorry. I just don't know
why everyone's acting

29:43.248 --> 29:44.615
like it's such a big deal.

29:44.682 --> 29:45.983
Ancient rivalry.

29:46.050 --> 29:47.618
Plus, their star
t-Rex Turner

29:47.685 --> 29:50.254
has been
lambrix's archenemy
since forever.

29:50.321 --> 29:52.623
I mean,
he is the defending
state champ,

29:52.690 --> 29:54.958
the only one
that John has
never beaten.

29:55.026 --> 29:57.161
Wow. My palms
are sweaty already.

29:58.596 --> 29:59.997
Girl: Come on, boomer!

30:03.835 --> 30:05.369
Yes! Yes! Yes!

30:12.443 --> 30:13.644
You're going down, my man.

30:13.711 --> 30:15.946
Yeah, all over you for the pin.

30:29.093 --> 30:30.894
Come on, boomer!

30:30.962 --> 30:32.296
Whoo!

30:32.363 --> 30:33.297
Come on, come on, come on!

30:33.364 --> 30:35.199
Hey.

30:35.266 --> 30:36.900
What was that about?

30:36.968 --> 30:38.035
Nothin'.

30:38.102 --> 30:40.470
Nothin'? Hmm.

30:40.505 --> 30:43.073
I changed my mind.
You're gonna sit
this one out today.

30:43.141 --> 30:44.908
What? Why?

30:44.976 --> 30:47.110
Because I'm not having
you dive into some
personal grudge match

30:47.178 --> 30:48.912
and maybe get hurt
before the season
even starts.

30:48.947 --> 30:50.814
I'm not gonna get hurt.
I'm gonna kick his butt.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.583
John, listen to me.
You're a senior.

30:52.650 --> 30:55.152
This is your last chance
at a state title.

30:55.220 --> 30:57.087
Now, you're on the bench.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.355
I'm putting Luke in your spot,
and that's the end of it.

30:59.390 --> 31:00.691
Now, go sit down

31:00.758 --> 31:02.993
and set an example
for the younger guys.

31:09.567 --> 31:11.068
Coach benched me.

31:11.135 --> 31:12.603
What?

31:24.749 --> 31:27.517
Come on, Luke!
Get him! Come on!

31:32.223 --> 31:34.391
Takedown, red.

31:36.594 --> 31:38.795
Neutral, green.

31:48.940 --> 31:52.509
Aah! Aah!

31:56.714 --> 31:59.549
Luke, echoing:
Aah! My shoulder!

32:02.020 --> 32:03.620
Better grab
Dr. Norman.

32:03.688 --> 32:06.323
Deep breath, Luke.
Deep breath.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.827
Try to lay still.
Try to lay still.

32:14.799 --> 32:17.301
They took the dude away
in an ambulance, Jace.

32:17.368 --> 32:18.869
An ambulance!

32:18.937 --> 32:21.605
Oh, come on.
That kind of stuff
happens in every sport.

32:21.673 --> 32:23.707
Which is
an excellent reason
to avoid athletics...

32:23.775 --> 32:25.008
Altogether.

32:25.043 --> 32:26.910
My dad says it's
a broken collarbone.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.812
Luke's
gonna be out for
at least 2 months.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.280
You know what this means, Jace.

32:30.348 --> 32:32.282
He's giving the 145 slot to you.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.017
Why would he do that?

32:34.085 --> 32:36.053
Because he says
you've worked harder
than anybody.

32:36.120 --> 32:38.021
You've earned it.
Besides,

32:38.089 --> 32:40.924
you're the only one
he's got who fits
the weight class.

32:40.992 --> 32:43.260
First match is tomorrow.

32:49.767 --> 32:52.302
Hey, Jace?
Your first official
match is Thursday.

32:52.370 --> 32:53.737
Your dad and i
can both be there.

32:53.805 --> 32:55.439
His last class
ends at 1:00.

32:55.506 --> 32:57.407
Heh. Mom,
you're not listening.

32:57.475 --> 32:59.142
I don't want you there.

32:59.210 --> 33:00.210
Why not?

33:00.278 --> 33:02.079
Because I'll be nervous enough.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.648
Having you and dad there
will only...

33:04.716 --> 33:07.851
I just want all my focus
to be on the match, ok?
It's nothing personal.

33:07.919 --> 33:09.853
It feels personal.

33:09.921 --> 33:11.188
I promise...

33:11.255 --> 33:13.223
I'll let you guys
come later in the season,

33:13.291 --> 33:15.425
as soon as I figure out
what I'm doing.

33:15.493 --> 33:17.060
Ok.

33:18.062 --> 33:20.230
As long as I'm still alive.

33:27.271 --> 33:29.840
The freak is still here.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.043
And I owe Luke 25 bucks.

33:33.111 --> 33:34.478
How much does that stink?

33:34.545 --> 33:37.147
Everybody thinks
it's so great
he's on the team.

33:37.215 --> 33:38.882
Do they even care
how it affects
the rest of us?

33:38.950 --> 33:40.884
No, it doesn't matter.
Everybody's too busy

33:40.952 --> 33:42.819
being politically correct.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.723
Hey, boomer.

34:11.215 --> 34:12.482
Hey, fly.

34:12.516 --> 34:14.851
Anybody can sit
over there in
the crowd and boo.

34:14.918 --> 34:17.219
You showed up
out there.
Keep your head up.

34:18.723 --> 34:21.123
Jace, you're on deck.
Make sure you're loose.

34:21.192 --> 34:22.958
Thanks, coach.

34:27.231 --> 34:29.299
Hey, Jace.

34:29.367 --> 34:31.168
Good luck out there, man.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.402
Good luck, man.

34:32.469 --> 34:33.469
Thanks, boomer.

34:33.538 --> 34:34.704
Sure, sure.

34:39.010 --> 34:40.911
Boo!

34:51.789 --> 34:54.424
Good job, Billy.
That's it.

34:57.595 --> 34:58.929
Jace.

35:02.400 --> 35:04.000
How do you feel?
You ready to go?

35:04.068 --> 35:05.168
Yeah.

35:05.236 --> 35:07.304
All right. Think about
what we worked on.

35:07.371 --> 35:08.905
Thanks, coach.

35:08.973 --> 35:10.740
Where is he?
I have no idea.

35:10.808 --> 35:12.976
Coach rice:
10 more steps.

35:16.814 --> 35:18.882
Somebody sit up all night
plannin' this out?

35:20.017 --> 35:21.551
When you disrespect a teammate,

35:21.619 --> 35:23.720
you disrespect yourself.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.089
It was just a joke, coach.

35:26.157 --> 35:27.991
No, John.
Jokes are funny.

35:28.059 --> 35:30.660
I won't have a bully on my team.

35:36.734 --> 35:38.602
Come on, get him, Jace!

35:45.143 --> 35:46.810
Whoo!

35:47.912 --> 35:48.979
This is pathetic.

35:49.046 --> 35:50.213
He's gonna hurt us.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.622
Coach rice: Go! Go!

35:58.689 --> 36:02.225
Go! Go! Go!

36:02.293 --> 36:05.762
Repeat! Repeat! Go!

36:38.629 --> 36:40.030
Oh, man.

36:49.874 --> 36:51.508
All: Go, huskies!

37:12.897 --> 37:14.764
Mary Beth:
He's at the end
of the bench.

37:14.832 --> 37:16.132
Jace: Thanks,
Mary Beth.

37:26.677 --> 37:29.813
Nice groove. Motown?

37:29.880 --> 37:31.815
Late seventies, early eighties?

37:31.882 --> 37:33.817
Maybe funk brothers on backup?

37:33.851 --> 37:36.019
Ah, nice ear,
Mr. newfield.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.354
Nice ear.

37:37.421 --> 37:39.789
Detroit, 1985.

37:39.857 --> 37:41.291
Not the funk brothers,

37:41.359 --> 37:43.059
but definitely inspired by.

37:45.563 --> 37:48.198
Something tells me
that you did not
seek me out

37:48.266 --> 37:50.433
simply to discuss
32-bar blues.

37:50.501 --> 37:51.668
Heh.

37:52.903 --> 37:54.671
Well...

37:54.739 --> 37:56.840
You know, I realize

37:56.907 --> 37:59.609
we haven't gotten
along that great,

37:59.677 --> 38:02.045
and I've been having
a rough time,

38:02.113 --> 38:04.281
and it seemed
like you were
the only one

38:04.348 --> 38:06.049
that could relate.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.317
Is this about music?

38:07.385 --> 38:08.585
Wrestling.

38:08.653 --> 38:11.821
Ah. I heard a rumor
that you joined the squad.

38:12.990 --> 38:14.858
I'm gettin' hammered.
Besides,

38:14.925 --> 38:16.826
a bunch of the guys
really resent me
for being there.

38:16.894 --> 38:18.928
Why'd you join up
in the first place?

38:20.131 --> 38:22.165
I wanted to be part of one thing

38:22.233 --> 38:25.268
where my disability
was totally irrelevant.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.103
And your music
doesn't give you that?

38:27.171 --> 38:29.873
Yeah,
if I want to be
a walking clich

38:29.907 --> 38:32.709
me, Stevie wonder, ray Charles,

38:32.777 --> 38:33.677
jos

38:33.744 --> 38:35.045
me.

38:36.180 --> 38:37.380
Sorry.

38:37.448 --> 38:39.516
No, don't apologize, man.

38:39.583 --> 38:42.585
I'm happy with who I am.

38:42.653 --> 38:43.953
Are you?

38:44.021 --> 38:46.122
Doesn't it ever tick you off

38:46.190 --> 38:47.657
that when people look at you,

38:47.725 --> 38:48.958
the only thing
they see is
a blind guy?

38:49.026 --> 38:52.529
What? I'm blind?

38:52.596 --> 38:54.531
How am I gonna get home?

38:54.598 --> 38:58.068
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

38:58.135 --> 39:00.003
Man, of course!
I'm a blind guy.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.238
So are you. So what?

39:03.374 --> 39:04.808
Thanks for your advice.

39:04.875 --> 39:06.943
Well, what do you want me
to say to you, huh?

39:07.011 --> 39:09.212
"Wait. Stay the course.
It gets easier."

39:09.280 --> 39:10.947
Well, guess what, man?
It doesn't.

39:10.981 --> 39:13.650
People are gonna treat you
differently always

39:13.718 --> 39:15.151
because you are different.

39:15.219 --> 39:17.287
Tell me something i don't know.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.289
Ok. Ok, I will.

39:19.357 --> 39:21.391
You have been
walkin' around here

39:21.459 --> 39:23.827
with a chip
on your shoulder
a mile high.

39:23.894 --> 39:26.996
You might as well have
this little blinking light
right on your shoulder

39:27.064 --> 39:30.567
that says,
"look at me. Pity me.
Poor, misunderstood me."

39:32.503 --> 39:34.237
Look, why don't you...

39:34.305 --> 39:36.639
Play your song another way?

39:36.707 --> 39:39.743
People listen
to the music you make.

39:39.810 --> 39:42.412
Play it so that they can see you

39:42.480 --> 39:44.347
as you really are.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.086
Wait up.
I gotta grab my jacket.

39:53.424 --> 39:55.325
Hey, newfield.

39:55.393 --> 39:58.294
Anybody tell you
practice ended
a half an hour ago.

39:58.362 --> 39:59.696
Yeah.

39:59.764 --> 40:02.432
Maybe for you guys
that have been winning.

40:06.537 --> 40:08.238
Hold on. Let me
grab that for you.

40:08.305 --> 40:10.407
No, thanks, John.

40:10.474 --> 40:11.908
I got it.

40:16.914 --> 40:18.281
You know...

40:18.349 --> 40:22.152
Even if I don't score us
one point this season,

40:22.219 --> 40:25.822
I don't want anyone
to be able to say
i didn't work my butt off.

40:35.132 --> 40:37.367
Hey, Mary Beth.
Hey, John.

40:39.670 --> 40:42.372
Weren't we supposed
to be reading?

40:44.642 --> 40:47.977
I'm sorry. I just...
I gotta do something

40:48.045 --> 40:49.846
to turn this
wrestling thing
around.

40:49.914 --> 40:52.115
I know you're not asking
for my advice,

40:52.183 --> 40:54.017
but can I give it anyway?

40:56.987 --> 40:58.788
Shoot.

40:58.856 --> 41:00.523
After listening to my dad

41:00.591 --> 41:02.659
and my brothers
for a million years,

41:02.726 --> 41:05.366
it seems to me that maybe
the reason why you haven't
won a match yet

41:05.396 --> 41:06.729
is because your balance is off.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.999
I mean, wrestling
is like dancing.

41:10.067 --> 41:12.502
Every move should flow
from your body's center.

41:12.570 --> 41:15.371
I mean,
learn that natural rhythm,
and you'll be fine.

41:15.439 --> 41:18.475
Great.
How do I do that?

41:18.542 --> 41:20.477
Well, first off,

41:20.544 --> 41:22.812
you can hire me
to be your dance coach.

41:30.020 --> 41:31.621
Good morning,
Mrs. newfield.

41:31.689 --> 41:34.357
Hello, Mary Beth.

41:34.425 --> 41:35.458
Nice dog.

41:35.526 --> 41:38.161
And this is supposed
to help me wrestle?

41:38.229 --> 41:40.497
Yes. But first,
we need some music.

41:40.564 --> 41:43.199
All right, no problem.
I got it.

41:49.139 --> 41:51.541
You know what?
I kinda brought my own.

41:51.609 --> 41:54.310
Fine.
Just tryin' to help.

41:55.646 --> 41:57.647
Now let's dance, ok?

41:57.715 --> 42:00.183
Put your hands on my waist.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.318
I promise I've had all my shots.

42:02.386 --> 42:04.988
Heh.
So have I.

42:05.055 --> 42:06.556
This isn't ballroom dancing.

42:06.624 --> 42:09.659
It's wrestling, ok?
Contact position.

42:09.727 --> 42:11.828
Ok, we're gonna
move right and left.

42:11.896 --> 42:13.463
Just go with the flow, ok?

42:13.531 --> 42:16.499
1, 2, 3, 4,

42:16.567 --> 42:19.002
5, 6, 7, 8.
Now back.

42:19.069 --> 42:21.170
1, 2, 3, 4.

42:21.238 --> 42:23.473
Forward, 1, 2, 3...

42:31.649 --> 42:34.417
1, 2, 3, 4.
All right.

42:34.485 --> 42:36.920
1, 2, 3, 4.
This is working.

42:36.987 --> 42:38.354
This is working.

42:38.422 --> 42:39.656
3, 4, and spin.

42:39.723 --> 42:41.457
Ok, this is <i>not</i> working, ok?

42:41.525 --> 42:43.092
There's no spinning
in wrestling.

42:43.160 --> 42:45.828
I know. I just thought
it was pretty funny.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.164
Ok...

42:48.232 --> 42:49.933
This is Jesse the wonder dog.

42:50.000 --> 42:51.467
He's gonna be
your wrestling partner.

42:51.535 --> 42:52.535
Uhh!

42:52.570 --> 42:54.704
Every move should flow
into the next, ok?

42:54.772 --> 42:57.307
Uh, your opponent acts,
you react.

42:57.374 --> 42:59.742
So, now show me
referee position.

43:01.712 --> 43:03.346
Ok. In a reversal,

43:03.414 --> 43:05.982
step one is to bring
your right knee up.

43:06.016 --> 43:08.718
Step 2, swing your
left knee through.

43:08.786 --> 43:11.588
Step 3, lean on your left elbow.

43:11.655 --> 43:14.390
Step 4,
grab the outside leg
and the inside arm

43:14.458 --> 43:15.892
and you flip.

43:16.727 --> 43:18.828
So, how does that feel?

43:18.896 --> 43:22.465
Pthhh! Ech.
Furball.

43:22.533 --> 43:24.100
Mary Beth:
I remember when
my youngest brother Tim

43:24.168 --> 43:27.070
told dad that
he was gonna play golf
instead of wrestle.

43:27.137 --> 43:29.372
My poor father felt so betrayed.

43:29.440 --> 43:30.907
Both your other brothers
are wrestlers?

43:30.975 --> 43:32.709
Oh, big time.
Billy was a state champ

43:32.776 --> 43:34.711
his junior <i>and</i> senior year.

43:34.778 --> 43:36.946
Man, how does your mom

43:37.014 --> 43:38.481
handle all that testosterone?

43:38.515 --> 43:39.616
Are you kidding?

43:39.683 --> 43:41.551
She's even more into it
than my dad.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.553
I mean, there could be
10,000 people at a meet,

43:43.621 --> 43:45.088
and you could hear her
screaming over everybody.

43:45.155 --> 43:46.322
Ha ha.

43:46.390 --> 43:47.824
That is, until
i start screaming,

43:47.891 --> 43:49.559
and then we're like
dueling maniacs,

43:49.627 --> 43:52.895
yelling and carrying on
until everybody else
clears out around us.

43:52.963 --> 43:54.230
Hmm.

43:55.165 --> 43:56.466
What?

43:58.836 --> 44:00.970
This is the first
conversation
we've ever had

44:01.038 --> 44:03.039
that hasn't ended up
being all about me.

44:03.107 --> 44:04.874
So?

44:04.942 --> 44:08.177
So... Why am i
such a selfish jerk?

44:08.245 --> 44:10.013
Selfish jerk?
That's a little harsh.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.848
No, seriously, Mary Beth.

44:11.915 --> 44:13.583
Why would you ever
want to hang out
with me?

44:13.617 --> 44:18.021
Because you don't care
that I look like
a hideous mutant she-beast.

44:18.088 --> 44:19.555
That's not true.

44:19.623 --> 44:21.724
How would you know?

44:40.077 --> 44:41.577
Because somebody like you

44:41.645 --> 44:44.614
would have to have
a face that matches
her heart.

44:46.417 --> 44:48.718
That's so sweet.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.823
Hey... Let's not
get too excited.

44:53.891 --> 44:55.058
I'm only flattering you

44:55.125 --> 44:56.893
so you'll
keep showing up
to cheer me on.

44:56.960 --> 44:58.161
Go, Jace.

44:58.228 --> 44:59.228
Go, Jace!

44:59.263 --> 45:01.130
Go, Jace!
Go, Jace!

45:05.903 --> 45:07.203
Referee: Takedown, red.

45:10.908 --> 45:12.475
Force it! Force it!

45:14.044 --> 45:15.244
That's 3!

45:15.312 --> 45:17.613
Green, injury time!
Red!

45:20.384 --> 45:22.585
Man, what is with you today?

45:22.653 --> 45:25.888
All you gotta do
is feel the flow.

45:25.956 --> 45:28.091
Great fat man's roll.

45:28.158 --> 45:29.692
Timing's good today.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.427
Thanks, coach.

45:32.996 --> 45:35.298
So, in wrestling,
you have a team score
and a match score.

45:35.365 --> 45:37.700
Ok? Each match has
3 2-minute periods,

45:37.768 --> 45:39.869
and you can score points
by using a reversal

45:39.937 --> 45:42.038
or an escape or a pin,
which ends the match.

45:42.106 --> 45:43.773
Escape?

45:43.807 --> 45:45.074
Got it.

45:46.009 --> 45:47.310
Here. I brought you
some books.

45:47.344 --> 45:48.464
Why don't you read up on it?

45:48.512 --> 45:49.545
Oh, homework.
Great, thanks.

45:49.613 --> 45:50.947
Go, Jace!

45:51.014 --> 45:52.014
Go, Jace!
Go, Jace!

45:55.085 --> 45:56.853
Go for the hip toss, Jace!

45:56.920 --> 45:58.888
Toss his hip!

46:01.091 --> 46:03.025
Out of bounds!

46:06.563 --> 46:07.663
Come on!

46:07.731 --> 46:09.499
What's going on?
Is it over?

46:09.566 --> 46:11.067
No, Jace is ahead by a point.

46:11.135 --> 46:12.401
That's good,
right?
Yeah.

46:13.370 --> 46:14.537
Center.

46:17.941 --> 46:20.543
Mary Beth:
Do the hip toss, Jace!

46:21.612 --> 46:24.046
Takedown 2, red!

46:29.052 --> 46:30.686
One, bring up your right knee.

46:33.257 --> 46:35.358
2, your left knee
swings through.

46:38.262 --> 46:39.929
3, drop to your left elbow.

46:39.963 --> 46:42.398
4, turn on
a 90-degree angle.

46:43.967 --> 46:46.869
5, grab the outside leg
and inside arm.

47:05.789 --> 47:08.057
That's one! No, no!
Nothing!

47:08.125 --> 47:11.360
That's it! Center!

47:11.428 --> 47:12.528
Whoo! Whoo!

47:12.596 --> 47:13.596
Yeah!

47:13.630 --> 47:15.765
Patty: Is it over?
Did he win?

47:15.833 --> 47:17.466
No idea!
Just cheerin'
anyways!

47:17.534 --> 47:19.235
Go, Jace!
Yeah!

47:19.303 --> 47:21.470
Whoo!

47:21.538 --> 47:23.005
Shake hands.

47:23.941 --> 47:25.775
Green!

47:25.843 --> 47:27.510
Victory, green!

47:28.412 --> 47:30.513
Unbelievable.

47:30.581 --> 47:31.948
Yep.

47:32.850 --> 47:33.983
Buddy, you won.

47:34.051 --> 47:36.352
Come on, man.
No sweat.

47:36.420 --> 47:38.387
That's what I'm talkin' about.

47:38.455 --> 47:40.923
Whoo! Go, Jace!
Whoo whoo!

47:47.998 --> 47:49.432
Jace. Jace.

47:49.499 --> 47:50.800
That's him right there.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.235
Jace newfield?

47:52.302 --> 47:54.170
Phil pavone from
the <i> mountain</i>
<i>valley times.</i>

47:54.238 --> 47:55.605
How's it going?

47:55.672 --> 47:57.506
Great. Listen,
I'm interested
in doing a story on you

47:57.574 --> 47:59.909
for the Sunday
sports section.
You got a minute?

47:59.943 --> 48:02.612
Well, um, my folks
are kinda waitin'
for me upstairs.

48:02.679 --> 48:05.281
We can certainly
schedule it for
another time.

48:05.349 --> 48:08.517
Thanks. You know,
I'm really flattered
and everything,

48:08.585 --> 48:10.920
but there's a bunch of guys
on that team do it
much better than I am.

48:10.988 --> 48:12.488
Why wouldn't you want
to interview them?

48:12.556 --> 48:13.996
Humble, too.
That's good.
That's good.

48:14.024 --> 48:15.858
Yeah, they're great, but listen.

48:15.926 --> 48:17.059
With you, it's different.

48:17.127 --> 48:18.895
With you there's
more of a, uh...

48:18.962 --> 48:20.296
Freaks and geeks angle?

48:20.364 --> 48:22.365
That's not it at all.
It's, uh...

48:22.432 --> 48:25.001
It's a wonderful
human-interest story.

48:26.436 --> 48:29.238
Mr. pavone,
can we make a deal?

48:29.306 --> 48:32.375
How about waiting till
i win a few more matches?

48:32.442 --> 48:34.677
You know,
really doing something
for the team.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.579
Then we'll talk, ok?

48:36.647 --> 48:39.015
Fair enough.

48:39.082 --> 48:40.683
Good job, kid.

48:42.953 --> 48:44.320
Thanks.

48:46.523 --> 48:48.591
Study the vocabulary words

48:48.625 --> 48:50.526
on page 79
of your workbooks, please.

48:50.560 --> 48:52.795
Expect a quiz.

48:52.863 --> 48:54.597
Yeah, what are you
worried about, boomer?
You're doing fine.

48:54.665 --> 48:55.898
Mike, did you get one?

48:55.966 --> 48:58.834
Mr. lambrix,
i need to talk to you
for just a minute.

49:00.003 --> 49:04.573
Um, just a bit
of a problem, John.

49:04.641 --> 49:07.043
If you're not able
to manage at least a "b"

49:07.110 --> 49:08.477
on the upcoming midterm,

49:08.545 --> 49:10.947
you're gonna have a "d"
in this class.

49:10.981 --> 49:13.749
That means you lose
your athletic eligibility.

49:15.252 --> 49:16.619
But Mr. kamen,

49:16.687 --> 49:18.654
you can't do that to me.

49:18.722 --> 49:20.156
We're right
in the middle
of the season.

49:20.223 --> 49:23.059
I'm not doing
anything to you, John.
Those are the rules, ok?

49:23.126 --> 49:24.727
It just means
you have to work
a little harder

49:24.795 --> 49:26.262
over the next few weeks.

49:26.330 --> 49:29.365
Well, I can't.
I don't get this stuff.

49:29.433 --> 49:30.866
It's... it's, like...

49:30.934 --> 49:32.735
It's like
a foreign language to you?

49:32.803 --> 49:33.869
Yeah, exactly.

49:33.937 --> 49:35.004
Yeah, yeah.

49:35.072 --> 49:37.673
Well, maybe you should
just find somebody

49:37.741 --> 49:38.674
to tutor you.

49:38.742 --> 49:40.576
<i>Buena suerte.</i>

49:45.482 --> 49:46.949
<i>Te puedo ayudar.</i>

49:47.017 --> 49:49.352
Huh?
What'd you just say?

49:49.419 --> 49:51.120
Relax.

49:51.154 --> 49:53.723
It means "i can help you"
in Spanish.

49:54.758 --> 49:56.092
Oh.

49:57.361 --> 49:58.961
You'd do that?

49:59.029 --> 50:01.230
After the hard time
we've been giving you?

50:03.300 --> 50:05.735
Yeah, well, maybe I realized

50:05.802 --> 50:08.404
I haven't been
the easiest guy
to be around.

50:09.806 --> 50:13.576
Ok. Thanks.

50:13.643 --> 50:15.277
You help me with my Spanish,

50:15.345 --> 50:19.248
I'll help you
amp up your
weight training.

50:19.316 --> 50:20.483
Deal?

50:21.451 --> 50:22.752
Deal.

50:32.896 --> 50:34.597
Up. Good job.

50:34.664 --> 50:36.232
Very good.

50:36.299 --> 50:37.333
What'd I do?

50:37.401 --> 50:38.601
Nothing.

50:38.668 --> 50:40.569
I'm saying tell me
"very good" in Spanish.

50:40.637 --> 50:42.204
<i>Muy bueno.</i>

50:42.272 --> 50:43.339
Excellent.

50:43.407 --> 50:45.007
<i>Excelente.</i>

50:47.377 --> 50:48.844
No.

50:48.912 --> 50:50.813
I'm saying, "excellent,"

50:50.881 --> 50:52.581
'cause you knew
"very good."

50:52.649 --> 50:54.116
What?

50:55.385 --> 50:57.353
<i>Agua.</i>

50:57.421 --> 50:58.621
Huh?

50:58.688 --> 51:00.256
Heh. I need water.

51:00.323 --> 51:01.757
Oh.

51:04.928 --> 51:06.929
Thank you.

51:06.997 --> 51:10.900
Ok, how do you say,
uh, "handshake"
in Spanish?

51:10.967 --> 51:13.335
Oh. It's, um...
Heh.

51:13.403 --> 51:14.570
It's, uh...

51:14.638 --> 51:17.506
<i>Manos. Manos...</i>
Um...

51:17.574 --> 51:18.574
What the heck is it?

51:19.576 --> 51:20.876
<i>Apret</i>

51:20.944 --> 51:23.179
just think, uh,
"to operate."

51:23.246 --> 51:26.982
You know, the surgeon
shakes your hand before
he operates on you.

51:27.050 --> 51:30.019
<i>Apret</i>

51:30.087 --> 51:31.220
yeah.

51:31.288 --> 51:32.888
That's tight.
Who is it?

51:32.956 --> 51:35.224
Oh. It's me.

51:35.292 --> 51:36.492
For real?

51:36.526 --> 51:38.661
Yeah, it's a fight song.
I'm still workin' on it.

51:38.728 --> 51:40.229
You should keep
workin' on it.
It's good.

51:40.297 --> 51:42.164
All right, uh, grab your gear.

51:42.199 --> 51:44.166
Let me show you somethin'.

51:44.234 --> 51:45.634
Ok.

51:49.439 --> 51:50.739
Here.

51:50.807 --> 51:52.475
All right.

51:52.542 --> 51:54.076
You ready?

51:54.144 --> 51:55.778
All right, listen.
All right, ok.

51:55.846 --> 51:58.547
Ready? All right,
go into your little
over-under.

52:01.885 --> 52:03.719
Ok.

52:03.787 --> 52:04.920
What was that?

52:04.988 --> 52:06.188
All right.
Now, that was

52:06.256 --> 52:07.590
my bread and butter
move, my friend.

52:07.657 --> 52:09.091
I mean, you learn that,

52:09.159 --> 52:10.793
and you're golden, all right?

52:10.861 --> 52:13.896
Here. One more time,
huh? Yeah? Ready?
All right.

52:40.924 --> 52:44.226
Very, very nice.

52:44.294 --> 52:46.095
Heh.

52:46.163 --> 52:47.730
Feel like some company?

52:47.797 --> 52:49.265
You think you can keep up?

52:49.332 --> 52:52.067
Did you... did he
just say that to you?
Yeah, he did.

52:53.336 --> 52:55.571
Go ahead.
Come on, wrestle boy.

52:55.639 --> 52:57.439
Heh.
Go ahead.

52:58.808 --> 53:00.509
That's it?

53:41.418 --> 53:43.285
Here it comes.

53:44.254 --> 53:46.889
Say what? Here goes.

53:58.368 --> 54:00.603
Make it dirty. Come on!

54:16.219 --> 54:17.720
1, 2...

54:20.257 --> 54:22.791
Ha ha ha ha...

54:25.629 --> 54:27.529
That was cool.

54:29.499 --> 54:32.835
Well... Told you
you could be a team player.

54:32.902 --> 54:34.503
I just took your advice.

54:34.571 --> 54:35.904
What was that?

54:35.972 --> 54:37.873
And please, don't
scare me by telling me

54:37.941 --> 54:39.981
that you actually listened
to something that I said.

54:41.544 --> 54:43.479
I got rid of that chip
on my shoulder

54:43.546 --> 54:44.913
the size of Brooklyn.

54:44.981 --> 54:47.283
Yeah. Good for you, man.

54:47.350 --> 54:48.951
It's kinda hard to wrestle

54:49.019 --> 54:51.720
when you got a weight
like that on you, right?

54:51.788 --> 54:53.355
Thank you.

54:53.390 --> 54:54.923
So...

54:54.991 --> 54:56.725
Wanna go again?

54:56.793 --> 54:58.761
Are you kidding?
I'm just getting started.

54:58.828 --> 54:59.695
All right.

54:59.763 --> 55:01.397
1, 2, 3, 4!

55:01.464 --> 55:03.332
Thank you, salt lake!

55:03.400 --> 55:05.134
Whoo!

55:15.445 --> 55:16.578
Referee: Takedown!

55:16.646 --> 55:18.347
2, 3!

55:20.884 --> 55:22.718
What?
John got the pin!

55:22.786 --> 55:25.020
2...Fall!

55:25.088 --> 55:26.855
Yeah!

55:29.159 --> 55:30.759
All right, John!

55:32.729 --> 55:34.396
Good job.

55:34.464 --> 55:36.665
Yeah!

55:36.733 --> 55:38.400
Go, fight, win!

55:38.468 --> 55:40.569
Go, fight, win!

55:48.645 --> 55:49.578
Takedown!

55:49.646 --> 55:50.846
2 points!

55:57.354 --> 55:59.822
1...2...

55:59.889 --> 56:01.724
Fall!

56:04.394 --> 56:06.662
Winner green!

56:06.730 --> 56:08.630
Shake hands, guys.

56:08.698 --> 56:14.269
Crowd: Jace, Jace,
Jace, Jace, Jace!

56:14.337 --> 56:16.505
Jace, Jace, Jace, Jace, Jace!

56:22.011 --> 56:23.946
Hey, there he is.
Hey, fly.

56:24.013 --> 56:25.214
Fly! Hey, fly.

56:25.281 --> 56:27.116
Wait up, man.

56:27.183 --> 56:29.218
Hey, guys.

56:29.285 --> 56:31.553
Jace: Where'd you run off
to so quickly?

56:31.621 --> 56:33.055
We're gonna have
victory burgers.

56:33.123 --> 56:34.323
You're comin', right?

56:34.391 --> 56:36.525
No, I've, uh... Gotta
help my cousin
with her math.

56:36.593 --> 56:38.727
What cousin?

56:38.795 --> 56:40.729
You don't know her, all right?

56:40.797 --> 56:42.131
I'll see you tomorrow, ok?

56:42.198 --> 56:43.899
See you, man.

56:47.804 --> 56:50.139
I'm fine. Doc says
I'm healed 100%.

56:50.206 --> 56:52.374
It's only been 5 weeks, Luke.

56:52.442 --> 56:54.410
All right? Let's give it
a little bit more time.

56:54.477 --> 56:56.078
You start working out
with us again,

56:56.146 --> 56:57.579
but take it slow.

56:57.647 --> 56:59.607
Coach, I don't want
to take it slow.
I'm ready now!

56:59.649 --> 57:01.583
Let's think about
your future, ok?

57:01.651 --> 57:04.486
You're gonna be much more
valuable to me next year
as a senior.

57:04.554 --> 57:06.622
What's the point of
risking permanent damage...

57:06.689 --> 57:07.689
Coach...

57:07.757 --> 57:10.826
We're gonna take
a few more weeks, ok?

57:17.534 --> 57:19.067
Go, Jace! Whoo!

57:19.135 --> 57:20.602
How's it goin', newfield?

57:20.670 --> 57:22.070
All right, guys.

57:22.138 --> 57:23.071
You! Newfield!

57:23.139 --> 57:24.540
Hey, what's your problem?

57:24.607 --> 57:26.341
What's my problem?
You wrecked my life...
that's my problem!

57:26.409 --> 57:28.076
What are you talking about?

57:28.144 --> 57:29.745
You took my slot, newfield.

57:29.813 --> 57:31.253
Now coach doesn't
wanna give it back!

57:31.314 --> 57:33.549
Hey, I earned that spot
after you got hurt,
Nolan.

57:33.616 --> 57:35.551
Now coach is happy
with what I'm doing.

57:35.618 --> 57:37.052
So deal with it!

57:40.590 --> 57:42.191
What was that all about?

57:42.258 --> 57:44.460
Jerk actually thinks
he's on the team
because he's good,

57:44.527 --> 57:46.462
not because
he's coach's charity case.

57:46.529 --> 57:48.730
Well, he has been
winning lately.

57:48.798 --> 57:50.232
<i>You're</i> gonna defend him now?

57:50.300 --> 57:52.234
Dude, I don't need
to defend him.

57:52.302 --> 57:53.902
He can defend himself.

57:55.939 --> 57:58.307
Coach rice?

57:58.374 --> 57:59.441
Coach?

57:59.509 --> 58:02.411
Over here, Jace.
What's up?

58:02.479 --> 58:05.080
I want a wrestle-off...
Me and Luke.

58:05.148 --> 58:07.683
Winner wins the 145 slot.

58:09.586 --> 58:11.186
I've already told Luke

58:11.254 --> 58:13.255
that he's not ready
to come back yet.

58:13.323 --> 58:14.857
Yeah, well, he thinks he is.

58:14.924 --> 58:16.525
He also thinks
that's the only reason

58:16.593 --> 58:18.026
you're not giving him a chance,

58:18.094 --> 58:21.563
is because you like
keeping me around here
for the freak factor!

58:21.631 --> 58:23.632
All right, you listen to me.
You listen good.

58:23.700 --> 58:26.535
I've been coaching
for 15 years, and I have
never once made a call

58:26.603 --> 58:28.637
that was not
in the best interest
of my team.

58:28.705 --> 58:30.706
You wanna think of yourself
as some kind of freak,

58:30.773 --> 58:32.708
you go right ahead.

58:32.775 --> 58:34.943
What I see is a kid
who's worked his tail off

58:35.011 --> 58:37.813
and earned his slot.

58:37.881 --> 58:40.682
Now, get your gear on, Jace.

58:48.558 --> 58:50.225
Step.
Thank you.

58:50.293 --> 58:52.160
You know, it really ticks me off

58:52.228 --> 58:54.396
that you guys are
so quick to question
my father's judgment.

58:54.464 --> 58:57.399
You never stop to think
how hard it all gets
for him.

58:57.467 --> 59:00.335
No matter what,
someone always is
crying and complaining

59:00.403 --> 59:01.837
how they're getting ripped off.

59:01.905 --> 59:04.106
You're like a stupid bunch
of spoiled babies.

59:04.173 --> 59:05.674
Ok.

59:05.742 --> 59:06.675
I screwed up.

59:06.743 --> 59:08.477
Do you want me to go
and apologize?

59:08.545 --> 59:10.746
I don't care.
Do what you want.

59:14.617 --> 59:16.151
Where did that come from?

59:16.219 --> 59:17.519
You said...

59:17.587 --> 59:19.555
Do what you want.

59:19.589 --> 59:21.023
But hey, if it freaked you out,

59:21.090 --> 59:23.492
then we can pretend like
nothing ever happened.

59:23.560 --> 59:24.693
Jace?
Yeah?

59:24.761 --> 59:26.528
Shut up.

59:26.596 --> 59:28.330
Good idea.

59:47.650 --> 59:49.117
Fly?

59:51.387 --> 59:54.423
Hey, I know you're there.
Talk to me, man.

01:00:02.999 --> 01:00:05.067
You really want to avoid me,

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:07.903
you gotta quit wearing
that stanky deodorant.

01:00:07.971 --> 01:00:10.305
Man, you and
your supersonic senses!

01:00:15.778 --> 01:00:17.012
Ow!

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.281
Hey, man, are you all right?

01:00:19.349 --> 01:00:21.383
You ok?

01:00:22.352 --> 01:00:24.820
Are you?

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.790
Please tell me what's goin' on.

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:31.426
I'm sick of being a loser, ok?

01:00:32.762 --> 01:00:35.263
So you're...
Ticked at me for winning?

01:00:35.331 --> 01:00:37.265
Yeah! At least when
you suckered me
into this,

01:00:37.333 --> 01:00:38.967
we were both equally pathetic.

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:41.203
But now i can't even quit,

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.271
or everybody
will really think
I'm a wimp.

01:00:43.339 --> 01:00:44.940
Let's go, newfield!

01:00:45.008 --> 01:00:47.109
Yeah, come on, man.
The party's already started.

01:00:47.176 --> 01:00:49.411
All right.
I'll be right there.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.381
Hey, can we talk
about this later?

01:00:52.448 --> 01:00:53.915
I gotta...

01:00:53.983 --> 01:00:57.119
Sure. Wouldn't want
to keep the superstars
waiting.

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.920
Fly...
Look...

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.555
I get it, Jace.

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.991
You don't owe me anything.

01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.994
Talk to you later, man.

01:01:21.244 --> 01:01:24.146
Didn't you have
a party to go to?

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:26.314
I told them to hit it
without me.

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.484
Why?

01:01:30.953 --> 01:01:33.822
Care to dance?

01:01:34.991 --> 01:01:36.858
'Scuse me?

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:38.760
Fly, you
gotta trust me
on this one.

01:01:38.828 --> 01:01:40.862
If it worked for me,
it's gonna work
for you.

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:42.898
All right, here we go, buddy.

01:01:42.932 --> 01:01:44.800
Ok, you ready?
Keep your knees
bent. Balance.

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:45.801
Ok. Step. Step.

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:47.269
Ok.

01:01:47.336 --> 01:01:48.537
Step.
All right.

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:49.871
Back.

01:01:49.939 --> 01:01:51.807
And... Hip toss.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.942
Uh... dude!

01:01:54.010 --> 01:01:55.577
Hip... Toss?

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.512
Hip toss.
Got it?

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.181
You feeling the flow?

01:01:59.248 --> 01:02:00.849
No, man.
Actually, no offense,

01:02:00.917 --> 01:02:03.118
but I'd rather be
dancing with Mary Beth.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.619
Come on. One more time.

01:02:04.687 --> 01:02:06.588
No, no, no. Since,
you know, you taught me one,

01:02:06.656 --> 01:02:08.256
I'm gonna teach you one,
all right?

01:02:08.324 --> 01:02:09.624
So watch this.

01:02:09.692 --> 01:02:12.027
It's like...

01:02:12.095 --> 01:02:13.895
Ah... Ooh... Oh! Oh!

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:15.063
Fly?

01:02:15.131 --> 01:02:16.064
Oh, oh, oh!

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:18.066
Fly. Fly.

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:20.335
I'm the blind guy.

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:22.471
Oh...

01:02:22.538 --> 01:02:24.473
Yeah. Good one,
though.

01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.975
Yeah. Well, I'll have
to teach you that one.

01:02:27.043 --> 01:02:28.210
One more time.
By the way,

01:02:28.277 --> 01:02:30.312
in real life,
you go like this...

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:31.913
Aah!

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:37.385
Ahh...

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:39.488
Lookin' good, newfield.
Lookin' good.

01:02:39.555 --> 01:02:42.891
Nice fit. Lookin' good.

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:45.360
How's yours fittin', fly?

01:02:45.461 --> 01:02:47.562
I look like the team mascot.

01:02:47.630 --> 01:02:49.598
What?

01:02:49.665 --> 01:02:51.500
This thing's humongous!

01:02:51.567 --> 01:02:54.069
Why don't you take it back
and get a small?

01:02:54.137 --> 01:02:56.238
This is a small.

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.373
Nice jacket, fly.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.809
What'd you do,
steal it from somebody's
older brother?

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:01.877
It's mine, yardley.

01:03:01.911 --> 01:03:03.211
Come here...

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:07.182
Takedown! 2 points!

01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:09.818
Come on, Jace.

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:11.186
What'd you do, fly?

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:13.088
You're next!

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:16.558
You nailed yardley?

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.160
Yeah, man. Wish you
could have seen it!

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:22.697
158.

01:03:24.901 --> 01:03:26.768
I don't get it, coach.

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:28.236
The scale doesn't lie.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:31.072
All I know is this...
You wanna face t-Rex,

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.508
you need to lose 6 by Friday.

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:37.112
Bummer.
Tell me.

01:03:38.281 --> 01:03:39.581
"From thence forward,

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.917
"he doubled the pains
he had been at
to instruct me.

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.224
"He brought me into all company

01:03:43.252 --> 01:03:45.020
"and made them treat me
with civility,

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:46.855
"because as he told them
privately,

01:03:46.923 --> 01:03:50.325
this would put me
into good humor and make
me more diverting."

01:03:50.393 --> 01:03:52.427
Hey, are you even listening?

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:54.029
Huh?

01:03:54.096 --> 01:03:55.831
Where's your head at, kid?

01:03:55.898 --> 01:03:58.433
Oh. Ha. Friday's
our last wrestling meet.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:00.168
And?

01:04:00.236 --> 01:04:03.038
And I'm amazed at how soon
it's gonna be over.

01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:05.173
Well, unless you
make it into states.

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:08.577
Which we won't unless
lambrix beats t-Rex...

01:04:08.644 --> 01:04:11.146
Which he won't even
get a shot at

01:04:11.214 --> 01:04:13.481
unless he loses 6 pounds
in 2 days.

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.484
Pressure's on, huh?

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:20.488
Remind me
why I wanted
to do this.

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:29.998
Wow. That was...

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:31.666
That was really, uh...

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.735
That was bad.
That was really bad.

01:04:33.803 --> 01:04:35.670
No, I'm just kidding.
It's ok. We can fix it.

01:04:35.738 --> 01:04:38.673
Do you wanna learn to play
something for real?

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:40.175
It can't be harder
than the flute.

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:41.543
Oh, the flute!

01:04:41.577 --> 01:04:43.612
Ok. Do the bass drum. Go.

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:53.255
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

01:05:51.847 --> 01:05:53.515
You don't want to do that.

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:55.684
I don't?

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:58.687
Well, who do you want
bugged at you more...

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:00.522
My daddy or coach?

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:03.258
Aren't they the same guy?

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:04.926
Exactly.

01:06:04.994 --> 01:06:06.461
Good night.

01:06:12.201 --> 01:06:13.401
Hey, coach!

01:06:13.469 --> 01:06:15.337
Hi, Jace.

01:06:20.576 --> 01:06:22.978
<i>Buenas dias, hijos m</i>

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:24.646
got about a minute.

01:06:24.714 --> 01:06:25.947
<i>Hola.
Gracias.</i>

01:06:26.015 --> 01:06:28.383
Hey, newfield, did you
read today's paper?

01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.952
Oh, my bad. He can't
unless it has little bumps.

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.921
Ok, let me read it for you.

01:06:32.989 --> 01:06:36.057
"Speaking of this visually
impaired spark plug,
Jace newfield,

01:06:36.125 --> 01:06:38.893
"coach rice said,
the great thing
about Jace is

01:06:38.961 --> 01:06:41.796
"whether we're winning
or losing, I know he's
a real inspiration

01:06:41.864 --> 01:06:44.232
to every kid
who sees him out there."

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:47.302
That's funny.
He tells us he's only doing
what's best for the team,

01:06:47.370 --> 01:06:51.172
but he tells the paper
that he's keeping you around
to be his poster boy.

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:04.886
Coach! If you don't
put me into a wrestle-off
with Luke Nolan,

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:07.455
I am quitting,
and that's the end of it.

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:09.524
Is that a threat?

01:07:11.761 --> 01:07:13.128
Oh.

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:16.131
Look... what's the point
of holding on
to my position

01:07:16.198 --> 01:07:19.701
if I can't prove
once and for all I'm
the best guy for that slot?

01:07:22.004 --> 01:07:24.305
All right, let's get this going.

01:07:25.841 --> 01:07:27.342
Contact position.

01:07:27.376 --> 01:07:29.511
Hope you had fun
while it lasted.

01:07:29.578 --> 01:07:32.080
Hope you like watching
the sectionals
from the stands.

01:07:33.215 --> 01:07:34.215
Ready...

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:35.817
Come on.
Take him, Jace!

01:07:37.553 --> 01:07:39.421
Wrestle!

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:44.492
Yes!

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:51.132
That's a pin!

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:53.902
I taught him that.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.844
Shake hands, guys.

01:08:04.113 --> 01:08:06.314
Good job.

01:08:06.382 --> 01:08:07.982
What's up?

01:08:09.585 --> 01:08:11.586
Pain. Ha.

01:08:11.654 --> 01:08:13.388
Popped out.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:16.124
Yeah. But you can just...

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:17.725
Pop it back in, right?

01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.261
I can, but it's gonna kill.

01:08:20.328 --> 01:08:22.764
C-can't be any worse
than it already is.

01:08:23.698 --> 01:08:25.332
All right. Trust me.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.068
Relax. Let me
have the wing.

01:08:27.136 --> 01:08:28.435
Let me have the arm.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:29.804
Let me have the arm.

01:08:31.439 --> 01:08:33.041
Hey, Mary Beth.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:34.609
Aah!

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:37.946
Ice.

01:08:38.013 --> 01:08:40.314
Ice it good.

01:08:41.450 --> 01:08:43.118
All right, let's go.

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:05.907
150 1/4 pounds.
He's in, coach.

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.108
Team: Yeah!

01:09:07.176 --> 01:09:09.015
All right, fellas.
You've worked hard for this.

01:09:09.044 --> 01:09:10.345
You deserve it.

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.412
Now let's go out there
and get it, huh?

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:13.548
Go on!

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:18.019
Team: Go, go, go, go, go!

01:09:22.957 --> 01:09:24.859
Whoa.

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:27.228
John... You ok?

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.763
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.198
You don't sound fine.

01:09:30.265 --> 01:09:32.533
Hey, look, maybe you
shouldn't do this today.

01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.969
Maybe you're...
Too wiped out.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:39.174
You don't get it, do you?

01:09:39.241 --> 01:09:41.542
This isn't just a sport for me.

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:44.179
It's who I am.
It's all I've got.

01:09:44.246 --> 01:09:46.714
Unlike you, i don't do music.

01:09:46.782 --> 01:09:49.050
All right?
I... i... i stink
in school.

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:51.352
I mean,
you take away
wrestling...

01:09:52.287 --> 01:09:54.956
I don't even know who I am.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.692
I mean, how sad is that?

01:10:02.998 --> 01:10:04.532
Go, Jace!
Come on, Jace!

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:19.447
Pin!

01:10:19.515 --> 01:10:20.815
Whoo!

01:10:28.557 --> 01:10:30.625
All right! Jace!

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:34.729
The winner green.
Winner green.

01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:36.231
Jace newfield of the huskies

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:38.032
wins the match
over the cowboys...

01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:40.001
Coach rice:
Jace!

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:41.703
Good job!

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.705
Is 18 to 12 for the huskies.

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:45.212
All right, John,
we studied the film.

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:47.041
You know
he's susceptible
to fireman's carry.

01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:49.444
I want you to
set it up the way
we talked about...

01:10:49.511 --> 01:10:51.579
I got this guy, coach.
Don't worry about it.

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:53.581
John! Need you to focus,
all right?

01:10:53.649 --> 01:10:56.684
Work the game plan.
This is what you
trained for. Let's go.

01:10:58.053 --> 01:10:59.520
Fly: Come on, John.
Go, John!

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:02.390
This is the match
we've all been waiting for,

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:05.059
2 undefeated champions
and longtime rivals.

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:10.598
In the 152-pound match,
it's homestead's John lambrix

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:15.036
versus our very own
wasatch valley cowboy
t-Rex Turner!

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.771
Shake hands, please.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:19.907
All right, here we go...

01:11:19.975 --> 01:11:22.877
Shake hands like gentlemen.
Let's shake hands
like gentlemen.

01:11:22.945 --> 01:11:24.579
Ok.

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:26.214
Ready.

01:11:30.419 --> 01:11:32.654
A single leg attempt...

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:34.522
John dive-rolled
out, man.

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.790
What's going on now?

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:48.002
John got a fireman's
takedown, man!

01:11:48.871 --> 01:11:49.937
2!

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:51.606
Takedown green!

01:11:52.508 --> 01:11:53.441
Oh...

01:11:53.509 --> 01:11:55.410
Referee: 2!
2 red!

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:00.481
That's it!

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:02.150
He's got him, Jace!

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.787
Takedown!

01:12:05.854 --> 01:12:07.388
Red!
Takedown, red!

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:09.624
Dude, t-Rex
just tossed John.

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:17.765
All right, John.
Let's go.

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:19.600
Find your good position.

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:21.169
Lambrix looks tired.

01:12:21.236 --> 01:12:23.037
He doesn't have
his usual energy.

01:12:23.872 --> 01:12:25.006
Boy: Let's go, John.

01:12:25.074 --> 01:12:26.441
Come on, man.

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:30.178
Fly: Come on, John.
You got him.

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:33.147
Lambrix
to the center of the mat.

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:47.795
Takedown by Turner!

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:49.931
John!
Get up! Get up!

01:12:49.998 --> 01:12:52.133
Let's see what happens.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.668
Took him to the shoulders.

01:12:53.736 --> 01:12:55.103
Bridge! Bridge!

01:12:55.170 --> 01:12:57.238
Aah!

01:13:02.678 --> 01:13:04.312
T-Rex gets the pin.

01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:08.316
The score tied...
the huskies 18,
the cowboys 18.

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:10.318
We're tied now.

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:12.787
The rest is up to you.

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:15.256
Good luck.

01:13:17.726 --> 01:13:19.994
Here we are in the last match
of the day.

01:13:20.028 --> 01:13:22.663
We've got 2 seconds left
in the third period.

01:13:24.166 --> 01:13:25.333
Come on, fry!

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:29.303
Very small, but they're strong,

01:13:29.371 --> 01:13:30.471
very wiry.

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:32.373
And shu picks up his opponent

01:13:32.441 --> 01:13:35.209
2! Takedown!
And drives him off the mat.

01:13:35.277 --> 01:13:38.546
Looks like the match
is over on the clock.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:41.149
We'll wait to see
what the referee says.

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:42.917
Fly!
Here they come.

01:13:43.919 --> 01:13:45.219
Good match, guys!

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.288
It's a win! A surprise win

01:13:47.356 --> 01:13:49.557
for Vincent "the fly" shu.

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:52.693
A big disappointment
for the cowboy fans.

01:13:52.761 --> 01:13:55.163
But they'll be looking
forward to next week

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:57.698
when they'll meet again
in the regionals.

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:05.673
Go! Go!

01:14:06.708 --> 01:14:08.376
Go!

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.711
Go! Go!

01:14:10.779 --> 01:14:12.914
Keep moving. Keep moving.

01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:17.652
All right, circle up.
Grab a knee.

01:14:17.719 --> 01:14:19.921
Come on, double time.
Let's go.

01:14:22.324 --> 01:14:24.158
I just wanna say
I'm really proud
of you guys.

01:14:24.226 --> 01:14:25.760
You've been working real hard,

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.929
and as you can see,
you're starting to
reap the rewards.

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:30.164
I think this husky team
has what it takes

01:14:30.232 --> 01:14:33.267
not only to go to state
but to bring home
the hardware.

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.470
Yeah!
Yeah!

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:36.704
Yeah!

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.973
That's what I'm
talking about, coach.

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:41.142
To give us the best
possible chance in
the sectionals Friday,

01:14:41.210 --> 01:14:42.910
I'm gonna put in a few changes.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:45.513
John, I appreciate
the sacrifice you
made for the team,

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.515
trying to get down to 52
and stay there,

01:14:47.583 --> 01:14:48.950
but it's obviously not working.

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.451
You're goin' back to 160, ok?

01:14:50.486 --> 01:14:54.422
What? No. Coach,
you do that, I don't get
my rematch with t-Rex.

01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:56.930
You were half-dead
out there. You're lucky
you didn't get hurt.

01:14:56.959 --> 01:14:59.293
So what? I'll sleep more.

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:01.696
I'll power down
protein drinks and vitamins.

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:03.130
No. I've made my decision.

01:15:03.198 --> 01:15:06.167
Dieting like that
is dangerous for
a guy of your frame.

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:07.768
You're going back
to 160. Ok?

01:15:07.836 --> 01:15:09.637
No. It's not ok.

01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:18.412
Ok, guys, that's not
gonna be a distraction.
I'll handle that later.

01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:20.081
We have 4 days left.

01:15:20.148 --> 01:15:21.582
Ok, I want everybody
to focus in,

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.651
think about all the things
we worked on all year.

01:15:23.719 --> 01:15:25.686
Think about your technique.

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:28.055
I want you to think about
what you've sacrificed

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:30.491
to be here at this point
with the chance
to accomplish something.

01:15:30.526 --> 01:15:33.294
One last thing...
Luke, you're back in at 145.

01:15:33.362 --> 01:15:36.297
Jace, you're goin' up to 152.
You're gonna take on t-Rex.

01:15:36.365 --> 01:15:39.000
Motion drill. On your feet!

01:15:41.603 --> 01:15:42.737
Wait a second.

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:45.139
Did he just say
I'm going up
against t-Rex?

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.441
Been nice knowing you, buddy.

01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:58.819
Aah!

01:15:59.955 --> 01:16:01.355
Wow!

01:16:01.423 --> 01:16:03.724
Felt that one.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.361
Something we need to talk about?

01:16:08.964 --> 01:16:11.165
T-Rex is gonna
snap me like a twig.

01:16:12.434 --> 01:16:14.001
You could always forfeit.

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.037
Yeah. Right.

01:16:16.104 --> 01:16:19.407
Then never show my face
at school again.

01:16:22.277 --> 01:16:23.711
On the other hand,

01:16:23.779 --> 01:16:25.846
you know, if you truly feel
like you're not up to it,

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:28.082
your mom's right.
You don't have to do it.

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:31.419
We're not gonna think
any less of you,
that's for sure.

01:16:33.155 --> 01:16:35.022
Look...

01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:36.824
Not to take the easy way out,

01:16:36.892 --> 01:16:39.026
but just listen to your heart.

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:12.426
Mr. Wyatt?

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:13.794
That's me.

01:17:13.829 --> 01:17:15.963
Why aren't you at lunch?

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:17.832
I wasn't hungry.

01:17:17.899 --> 01:17:19.767
Well, you gotta
pardon me for eating,

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:21.769
'cause I am starvin'
like Marvin.

01:17:21.837 --> 01:17:23.571
Hey, that was
really nice, though.

01:17:23.639 --> 01:17:26.941
Play that, uh...

01:17:27.009 --> 01:17:28.509
Thanks.

01:17:33.248 --> 01:17:34.782
You know what I hate?

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.551
When people talk how brave
and courageous I am

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:39.654
for doing things
that sighted people
do every day.

01:17:39.721 --> 01:17:41.689
Like wrestling?

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:42.857
Yeah.

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:45.059
You know, bravery
had nothing
to do with it.

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.228
And now they all expect me
to go out there

01:17:47.295 --> 01:17:49.130
and wrestle a guy
like t-Rex Turner.

01:17:49.197 --> 01:17:50.865
How messed up is that?

01:17:50.899 --> 01:17:53.501
Well, coach obviously
thinks you can handle it.

01:17:53.568 --> 01:17:56.637
Yeah, but he's not
the one going out
there, is he?

01:17:56.705 --> 01:17:59.907
You know... I'm sick
of almost killing myself

01:17:59.975 --> 01:18:03.044
to fit in.
I'm really sick of it.

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:04.979
You're sick of what?

01:18:05.047 --> 01:18:07.548
Aren't you
the one that joined
the wrestling team?

01:18:07.616 --> 01:18:08.849
I was just trying to...

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:10.351
You were just try...
No, no, no.

01:18:10.419 --> 01:18:12.153
You joined the wrestling team

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.854
to be just like everybody else.

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:15.523
Well, I got some news
for you, Jace.

01:18:15.590 --> 01:18:17.425
Everybody's afraid, man.

01:18:17.492 --> 01:18:19.126
Especially people your age,

01:18:19.161 --> 01:18:21.762
trying to figure out
who they are and
where they're going

01:18:21.830 --> 01:18:23.197
and who they're gonna be.

01:18:23.265 --> 01:18:25.900
Man, it is
absolutely terrifying.

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:29.503
But, see, what you
gotta do, right...

01:18:29.571 --> 01:18:32.940
Is you have to treat
that fear like one
of your opponents.

01:18:33.008 --> 01:18:35.142
You have to wrestle it
to the ground,

01:18:35.210 --> 01:18:37.878
and then you have to
get on top of it.

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:40.381
You get me?

01:18:40.449 --> 01:18:42.283
Yeah.

01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:43.484
Cool.

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.386
But you made me miss my lunch.

01:18:45.454 --> 01:18:47.188
Get ready for class.

01:18:54.329 --> 01:18:56.630
Don't tell me
you're bailin' on us.

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:58.566
It's over, Jace.
Let it go.

01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:00.134
Maybe I don't wanna let it go.

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:02.269
Maybe I've worked my butt off
this entire season

01:19:02.337 --> 01:19:03.804
because I got the stupid idea

01:19:03.872 --> 01:19:05.940
that this whole thing
was about being part
of a team.

01:19:06.007 --> 01:19:07.475
What's your point?

01:19:07.542 --> 01:19:10.478
You're the one that said
wrestling's all you are,
all you have.

01:19:10.545 --> 01:19:12.780
Finish what you started, man.

01:19:12.848 --> 01:19:16.150
What does it matter
if you wrestle t-Rex Turner
or Joe faceless?

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:18.986
We don't care.
All we care about is you
go out there and you win.

01:19:19.054 --> 01:19:21.956
Hey! If anyone should
run away, it's me.

01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:25.025
I mean... Ha...
Facing t-Rex, it's...

01:19:25.093 --> 01:19:27.461
It's insanity.

01:19:29.264 --> 01:19:31.298
You're gonna do this thing?

01:19:31.366 --> 01:19:33.768
'Cause I can
pretty much guarantee

01:19:33.835 --> 01:19:37.271
he's gonna put some
serious hurt work
on you.

01:19:37.339 --> 01:19:39.039
I know.

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.041
But you're gonna show up anyway?

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:43.744
I will if you will.

01:19:46.181 --> 01:19:48.282
Who am I kidding, huh?

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:51.285
I'm totally addicted
to the glory rush.

01:19:51.353 --> 01:19:52.720
Come on.
All right.

01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:02.163
We're under way
with this year's all-state
regional wrestling tournament,

01:20:02.197 --> 01:20:04.431
and tonight's 2 winners
will get that coveted berth

01:20:04.499 --> 01:20:06.400
in next weekend's
state championship.

01:20:06.468 --> 01:20:08.803
And there's a takedown

01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:11.972
and 6-point lead,
an early lead
for the cowboys.

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:14.375
Go, huskies!

01:20:14.442 --> 01:20:17.044
And now, heating up
this crosstown rivalry

01:20:17.078 --> 01:20:19.713
and moving up to
the 165-pound weight class

01:20:19.781 --> 01:20:22.616
for the huskies,
it's John lambrix

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:25.519
and Andrew Krieger
for the cowboys.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:27.221
Whoo!

01:20:28.290 --> 01:20:30.191
And we're under way,
and here we go.

01:20:32.761 --> 01:20:33.928
Come on, John!

01:20:33.995 --> 01:20:35.629
And here they go.
Jockeying for position.

01:20:35.697 --> 01:20:38.365
Krieger gets his first
takedown with a fireman.

01:20:38.433 --> 01:20:41.669
A great escape,
and 1 point there.

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:44.004
Referee:
1 escape green!

01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:48.409
Referee: 2!
2 takedown green!

01:20:48.476 --> 01:20:50.678
3...4...

01:20:50.745 --> 01:20:52.746
And he's got...
A pin!

01:20:52.814 --> 01:20:55.049
Yes, he got a pin,
and that ties it up.

01:20:55.116 --> 01:20:57.885
6 points each for the huskies
and the cowboys.

01:21:06.494 --> 01:21:08.896
And now the huskies' Vincent shu

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:11.498
takes on the cowboys'
Grant geisler

01:21:11.566 --> 01:21:13.868
in the 103-pound category.

01:21:17.138 --> 01:21:18.606
Go get him, fly!

01:21:22.143 --> 01:21:23.444
Referee: 2!

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:30.484
And there's the pin!

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:33.454
He pinned his guy!
No!

01:21:33.521 --> 01:21:34.822
Yeah!
He pinned his guy!

01:21:34.890 --> 01:21:36.223
Fly!

01:21:36.291 --> 01:21:38.859
You know, they call him the fly,

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:40.427
and he certainly
flew through that,
as Vincent shu

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:42.897
grabs his win and picks up
another 6 points

01:21:42.931 --> 01:21:43.864
for the homestead huskies.

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:45.599
That's what I'm
talking about! Come on!

01:21:45.667 --> 01:21:46.700
Yeah!

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.502
Good job, fly!
Good job, man!

01:21:48.570 --> 01:21:51.272
Yeah! Buddy,
way to go, man!

01:21:55.744 --> 01:21:57.077
Referee: 2!

01:21:58.213 --> 01:21:59.813
Nolan's getting up.
He spins back out,

01:21:59.881 --> 01:22:01.415
looking for an advantage.

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:09.156
Now we got a nice takedown
under the back arch.

01:22:09.224 --> 01:22:12.893
And there's the pin
and another win
for the cowboys.

01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:14.495
Good match.

01:22:14.562 --> 01:22:17.197
All right, folks,
as we head into the final
match of this roundup,

01:22:17.265 --> 01:22:19.900
remember, the huskies
lead it 34-29,

01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:23.270
and anything but a pin
will send the huskies on
to state.

01:22:23.338 --> 01:22:25.539
All right, here we go!

01:22:25.607 --> 01:22:27.541
Remember what i told you, ok?

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:30.244
T-Rex loves the legs.
He's gonna go in
for that sweep single,

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:32.446
so make sure
you watch it, all right?

01:22:32.514 --> 01:22:33.447
Got it.

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:34.748
How you feelin'?

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:36.417
Like a dinosaur snack.

01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:38.953
Come on. You can
do this, all right?

01:22:39.020 --> 01:22:40.387
Let's go, Jace!

01:22:40.455 --> 01:22:43.857
Go, Jace. Come on, Jace.

01:22:43.925 --> 01:22:47.795
Ready to go, man.
Ready to go.

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:49.430
Jace.

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:51.098
Like the man said,

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.400
all you gotta do
is keep from gettin'
smushed.

01:22:53.468 --> 01:22:54.969
Right, fly?
That's right.

01:22:55.036 --> 01:22:57.438
I already know
you're not gonna
get pinned.

01:22:57.505 --> 01:22:59.807
You've worked so hard
this year, you should
be proud of yourself.

01:22:59.874 --> 01:23:02.176
I can't wait to see
what you're gonna go
out here and accomplish

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:04.111
in front of all these people.

01:23:04.179 --> 01:23:05.112
Go get him!

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:06.347
Ok.

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:11.018
All right, folks.
Here's another husky competitor

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:13.287
who's moving up in weight class.

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:17.057
This promises to be
the all-star match
of the evening.

01:23:17.125 --> 01:23:18.392
Come on, Jace!

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.862
It's the one that everyone's
been waiting for.

01:23:21.930 --> 01:23:24.732
Right now, it's 2-time
defending state champion

01:23:24.799 --> 01:23:27.501
t-Rex Turner taking on
homestead's blind sensation

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:29.903
Jace newfield.

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:32.439
And what a contest this will be.

01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:38.278
Grappling for position.

01:23:38.313 --> 01:23:40.647
But the leg sweep,
it didn't hit.

01:23:40.715 --> 01:23:42.149
Still looking around...

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:44.852
Tries again with
a little leg sweep.

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:45.919
Finally, it's there.

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:46.987
2! Red, takedown!

01:23:47.055 --> 01:23:48.856
Come on, Jace!

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:55.329
Go, Jace!

01:23:55.397 --> 01:23:56.764
All right, buddy!

01:23:58.266 --> 01:24:00.134
All right,
come on! Come on!

01:24:03.471 --> 01:24:04.405
Roll out!

01:24:04.472 --> 01:24:07.775
Referee:
One escape, green!

01:24:07.842 --> 01:24:11.412
And that's the end
of the first period.

01:24:20.255 --> 01:24:24.091
And here we go
into the second period.

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:33.434
Throws him down.

01:24:34.636 --> 01:24:35.569
No points.

01:24:35.637 --> 01:24:37.137
Jace seems to escape.

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:38.939
Once again, another body slam.

01:24:39.007 --> 01:24:40.808
These have to take their toll.

01:24:42.844 --> 01:24:46.113
Fly: Come on, Jace.
Get out of it!

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:50.184
And another...

01:24:50.251 --> 01:24:53.754
Back drop body fall...

01:24:53.788 --> 01:24:54.922
Oh!
Oh!

01:24:54.989 --> 01:24:57.191
That one looked like it hurt.

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:01.495
And that's the end of...

01:25:01.563 --> 01:25:03.464
Contact. Come on.

01:25:07.168 --> 01:25:09.203
Grappling for position.

01:25:14.042 --> 01:25:15.442
Come on! Rrr!

01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.781
Still no advantage.

01:25:20.849 --> 01:25:22.382
Rrr!

01:25:36.197 --> 01:25:37.931
Fly: Break out!

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:39.133
Come on, Jace!
You got him!

01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:41.468
4!
Just gotta break out!

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:42.870
5!

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:44.304
That's it!

01:25:54.282 --> 01:25:55.215
Go, Jace!

01:25:55.283 --> 01:25:56.817
Come on!
Get up!

01:25:56.885 --> 01:25:58.519
Roll him over!

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:02.623
And he's out.
That's a 1-point escape.

01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:05.993
There seems to be
a time-out call

01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:08.095
for Jace newfield.
Yes, it's an injury call.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:10.264
Referee: Coach,
i think he's hurt.

01:26:10.331 --> 01:26:12.099
This could spell disaster
for these huskies.

01:26:12.167 --> 01:26:13.167
Is he all right?

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:15.135
Remember, there's
an injury time limit.

01:26:15.203 --> 01:26:19.206
That means that newfield
will have to answer
the referee's call.

01:26:19.274 --> 01:26:20.707
Pop out again?

01:26:20.775 --> 01:26:22.276
No. It just hurts.

01:26:22.343 --> 01:26:24.378
Can you go?
Yeah.

01:26:26.881 --> 01:26:28.215
All right,
28 seconds left, Jace.

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.551
You're in this thing.
Now, he knows
you're hurt there,

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:32.352
so he'll probably
attack it.
Use it as bait.

01:26:32.420 --> 01:26:34.288
Leave it open.
Set up a lateral drop.

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:35.956
But you can't get pinned.

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:38.192
So if it doesn't
work out, get back
to your base,

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:39.426
fat man's roll.

01:26:49.137 --> 01:26:50.337
You ready to go, son?

01:26:50.405 --> 01:26:51.638
Ready, ref.

01:26:51.706 --> 01:26:54.508
Everything you've got,
leave it on the mat.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.184
Go!

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:08.822
T-Rex only has 28 seconds

01:27:08.890 --> 01:27:11.625
to pin this incredibly
feisty opponent.

01:27:11.693 --> 01:27:12.726
Jace, come on!

01:27:12.794 --> 01:27:15.929
Wasatch valley team knows,
no pin, no win,

01:27:15.997 --> 01:27:19.099
so the question is
can Jace newfield hold on

01:27:19.167 --> 01:27:21.435
and clinch the victory
for the huskies?

01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:23.937
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're about to find out.

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:28.609
Jace hits his lateral drop.
There it is.

01:27:28.676 --> 01:27:30.244
2-point takedown.

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:31.478
Yeah!

01:27:31.546 --> 01:27:33.046
Referee: 2!
2, 3, pin!

01:27:33.114 --> 01:27:35.449
T-Rex with a reversal there,

01:27:35.516 --> 01:27:37.150
a 2-point reversal.

01:27:42.457 --> 01:27:44.124
But no points.

01:27:45.226 --> 01:27:46.660
Jace works for the fat man roll.

01:27:46.728 --> 01:27:49.229
And there it is.

01:27:49.297 --> 01:27:51.665
Referee:
3, 2...

01:27:51.733 --> 01:27:53.200
1, 2...

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:57.137
1, 2...

01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:58.372
3!

01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:03.577
Yeah!
Whoo!

01:28:03.645 --> 01:28:06.747
Referee: Fall green!
Great match.

01:28:07.882 --> 01:28:09.883
What an incredible match!

01:28:11.753 --> 01:28:13.120
Shake hands.

01:28:13.187 --> 01:28:15.088
What an amazing turnaround.

01:28:15.156 --> 01:28:16.623
The win goes to Turner,

01:28:16.691 --> 01:28:18.258
but the team win
goes to the huskies,

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:19.760
and they're on to state!

01:28:25.099 --> 01:28:26.867
Yes! Yes! Yes!

01:28:26.934 --> 01:28:27.868
Good job.

01:28:27.935 --> 01:28:29.102
Good job, newfield.

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:30.337
I'll see you at state.

01:28:30.405 --> 01:28:32.205
I'll be there.

01:28:32.273 --> 01:28:34.274
And that move of yours...

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:36.677
It won't work again.

01:28:36.744 --> 01:28:38.011
Jace!

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:41.782
Fly: We won, Jace!

01:29:11.646 --> 01:29:14.081
Jace, Phil pavone
from the <i> mountain valley times.</i>

01:29:14.148 --> 01:29:16.083
Now do you feel
you've earned the right

01:29:16.150 --> 01:29:17.918
to have me do a story on you?

01:29:17.985 --> 01:29:19.419
I guess.

01:29:19.487 --> 01:29:21.755
Ok, listen, I'd like
to get a little
background first,

01:29:21.823 --> 01:29:23.824
if it's ok with you,
talk some of
your teammates.

01:29:23.891 --> 01:29:25.359
Sure.
Knock yourself out.

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:27.160
Yeah!
Whoo!

01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:29.229
John. Phil pavone
from the <i> mountain valley times.</i>

01:29:29.297 --> 01:29:31.098
Hey, you've been wrestling
for 4 years.

01:29:31.165 --> 01:29:33.166
What makes this season
so different,

01:29:33.234 --> 01:29:34.601
having a blind teammate?

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:36.336
Wait. Who's blind?

01:29:36.404 --> 01:29:38.572
Well, this guy right here,

01:29:38.639 --> 01:29:39.573
Jace newfield.

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:40.907
Jace... Is blind?

01:29:40.975 --> 01:29:42.275
Are you serious?

01:29:42.343 --> 01:29:44.611
Gosh, I hadn't even noticed!

01:29:44.679 --> 01:29:46.947
Hey, mallon, Mike, mallon,

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:48.915
did you know that, uh,
Jace is blind?

01:29:48.983 --> 01:29:50.217
No way!

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:52.252
Yeah. That's what
this guy's trying
to tell me.

01:29:52.320 --> 01:29:53.787
Sounds like the dude
better check his facts.

01:29:53.855 --> 01:29:55.789
I hang out with the dude
all the time,

01:29:55.857 --> 01:29:57.724
and it's never occurred
to me that he's like that.

01:29:57.792 --> 01:30:00.394
Yeah, I don't know, man,

01:30:00.461 --> 01:30:03.463
you might wanna go
do some more research.

01:30:05.366 --> 01:30:08.068
Well, look who's
here. It's the man
of the hour.

01:30:08.136 --> 01:30:09.069
Hey!

01:30:09.137 --> 01:30:10.737
What's up, guys?

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:12.139
Aw, ow, watch the shoulder.

01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:13.140
Oh, sorry, sorry!

01:30:13.207 --> 01:30:15.575
You were amazing tonight, Jace.

01:30:15.643 --> 01:30:18.078
Thank you. Hey, uh,
do you guys think

01:30:18.146 --> 01:30:20.080
you could give us a minute?

01:30:20.148 --> 01:30:21.248
Sure.

01:30:21.315 --> 01:30:22.582
No problem.

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.818
Yeah, we'll be out front.

01:30:24.886 --> 01:30:27.721
Thanks. I'll be
right there.

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:31.191
I'm so proud of you.

01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:34.060
Cool.

01:30:35.797 --> 01:30:37.731
Would you, uh...

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:39.699
Care to dance?

01:30:39.767 --> 01:30:41.735
I'd love to.

01:30:41.803 --> 01:30:44.738
You know, I hear
it's a lot like
wrestling.

01:30:46.040 --> 01:30:48.008
All you gotta do
is feel the flow.
