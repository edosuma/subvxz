My name is Earl.

00:12.780 --> 00:15.116
Earl, you just crossed off June
and July of next year.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.017
Are those months
not happening anymore?

00:17.085 --> 00:19.787
I don't mind.
It's just that I need
to move some stuff around.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.623
I'm just figuring out
how much time the warden's
takin' off my sentence.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.658
[ Earl Narrating ]
For a few months now,

00:24.725 --> 00:26.727
every time I solved a problem
for the warden,

00:26.794 --> 00:29.997
he gave me a certificate
worth a week or two
off my time in prison.

00:30.064 --> 00:34.034
I helped the leaders
of two violent gangs learn
to get along... really well.

00:34.102 --> 00:37.605
I captured an escaped prisoner,
with a little help from Randy...

00:37.671 --> 00:40.374
and a high-ranking K-9 officer.
[ Growling ]

00:40.441 --> 00:44.278
I even cleaned all the hair out
from the prison showers.

00:48.616 --> 00:52.486
Pretty soon I'd gotten all
but six months taken off
my sentence.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.955
And lucky for me,
the warden was one
of those people...

00:55.022 --> 00:57.558
who never seem
to run out of problems.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.829
Earl! Thank God you're here.
I'm totally screwed.

01:01.895 --> 01:04.965
- You could just
open the safe again.
- What?

01:05.032 --> 01:08.469
Oh, not this.
I do this all the time. No.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.638
I was at this press conference,

01:10.704 --> 01:13.874
and this really tricky reporter
tricked me...

01:13.941 --> 01:17.278
w-with his tricky trickiness.

01:17.345 --> 01:20.948
...continues my commitment
to statewide education reform.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.783
- [ Clamoring ]
- Yes, Andy?

01:22.850 --> 01:25.986
Governor, I actually have
a question for your husband.

[ Nervous Laugh ]

01:29.457 --> 01:31.425
Jerry.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.534
- Thank you.
- Wait, Warden Hazelwood.

01:40.601 --> 01:43.904
Many of your programs
have failed.

01:43.971 --> 01:46.574
What do you plan to do
to turn around
this dismal record?

01:46.640 --> 01:50.678
Well, I have what I call
the Super-duper Super Program.

01:50.744 --> 01:53.614
I don't want to go
into all the details now,

01:53.681 --> 01:56.150
but I gotta tell you,
it's pretty great.
[ Chuckles ]

01:56.217 --> 01:59.987
At Quillen Penitentiary,
the warden has instituted
a reconciliation program...

02:00.053 --> 02:03.123
where criminals
and their victims
meet face to face.

02:03.191 --> 02:06.227
To fight.
Two men enter,
one man leaves.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.862
Yes, we're doin' that.

02:08.929 --> 02:11.365
Not fight, Jerry. To reconcile.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.767
Yes. We have that too.

02:13.834 --> 02:16.337
Uh, they have a choice.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.506
Naturally we try
to steer them
towards makin' up.

02:18.572 --> 02:21.475
[ Nervous Laugh ]
So. Any more questions?

02:23.043 --> 02:25.579
I have no idea
how to do this.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.949
Earl, you got
six months and 10 days
left in here.

02:29.016 --> 02:31.018
Now, you make
this program work,

02:31.084 --> 02:34.688
and I will give you
a certificate for six months
off your sentence.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.625
Six months? I'll do it.

02:37.691 --> 02:41.094
Then I'll only need
a certificate worth 10 days,

02:41.161 --> 02:44.198
which maybe I can get by...

02:44.265 --> 02:46.934
making you my world-famous
cheese omelet.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.902
That does sound good.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.004
We'll talk.

02:51.071 --> 02:54.408
[ Earl Narrating ] I like the
idea of helping a prisoner make
up for something bad he did,

02:54.475 --> 02:56.710
since that's what I do
with my list.

02:56.777 --> 03:00.348
All I had to do now
was find the right guy.

03:00.414 --> 03:03.451
Sure are a lot of people in here
for aggravated assault.

03:03.517 --> 03:06.920
Isn't everybody
who commits assault
kind of aggravated?

03:06.987 --> 03:10.258
Not necessarily.
Remember when I hugged
that baby duck to death?

03:10.324 --> 03:12.293
That was fun
until it was sad.

03:12.360 --> 03:15.896
When you get free, we're gonna
go back to that lake
and just do the fun part.

03:18.366 --> 03:20.401
This guy could work.

03:21.369 --> 03:23.471
John Clevenger.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.174
[ Earl Narrating ]
I'd heard about John.

03:27.241 --> 03:31.279
He was a sensitive,
artistic type
and a first-time offender.

He was in prison for burning

when his meth lab caught fire.

Cool.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.178
I'm glad that name finally
caught on. I started that
a couple weeks ago.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.180
Oh, good for you.

I've been pushin'
for Duke of Earl,
but it won't stick.

You got anything else
you're not supposed to have?

Maybe somethin' salty?

about what happened
with your parents.

- That fire was an accident.
- Clearly.

No one makes meth
with anything
but the best intentions.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.940
How would you feel
about a program...

04:33.006 --> 04:35.376
where you could sit down
with your parents and talk?

04:35.443 --> 04:37.511
Really hash things out.

04:37.578 --> 04:40.348
And hopefully it would
lead to an apology
and a big hug.

04:40.414 --> 04:43.283
Wow. Well--

04:43.351 --> 04:45.319
I can't imagine they're
gonna want to do that,

I'm in.
- Great.

Since I couldn't go myself,

04:49.657 --> 04:51.659

with John's parents...

04:51.725 --> 04:54.194
and convince 'em
to come see their son.

Look, I understand
you feelin' weird
about meeting with your son.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.733
I mean, everybody
hates meth heads.
That's a hundred-percenter.

On the other hand,
he is your son.

I just don't think
meeting with John
is such a good idea.

He was a very sweet boy,
but he changed.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.747
Hell, everybody changes.
Changed how?

05:13.814 --> 05:18.852
Well, with John was little,
he didn't burn down the house
and destroy everything we own,

05:18.919 --> 05:20.821
so that was different.

05:20.888 --> 05:24.925

what you're going through.

knocked over a candle
in our trailer...

To this day, I don't know
if it was a accident...

05:35.703 --> 05:39.507

turtle hostilities
of some kind.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.710
Our relationship
was very strained
the next few months.

05:42.776 --> 05:45.245
We couldn't even
be in the same room.

05:45.312 --> 05:47.080
Usually I'd leave
because it was quicker.

was over.

05:51.585 --> 05:53.887
I think we both did.

But eventually we sat down
and faced our problem head on.

11:08.035 --> 11:11.038
Oh, yeah.
A theme unifies
all your elements.

Ooh. How about that one?

11:13.140 --> 11:15.142
"Underwater Wonderland."
That's awesome.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.044
Plus, my hair looks
really good when it's wet.

11:17.110 --> 11:19.747
It looks kind of expensive.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.951
Is that a whale

He's got money?

11:26.419 --> 11:28.588
Yeah. He won the lottery.
Didn't he tell you?

11:28.655 --> 11:32.692
He's got $24,612.17 left,
minus 400.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.362
Kids' school was selling
candy and you went
a little crazy.

11:35.428 --> 11:38.999
We could throw
a pretty awesome prom
for $24,000.

Oh, snap.

to a magical universe.

[ Earl Narrating ]
Things were addin' up fast.

11:51.244 --> 11:54.647
But then I thought about
how much I'd enjoy
being out of prison.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.650
It was the little things
about life on the outside
I missed the most,

11:57.717 --> 12:00.487
[ Alarm Clock Beeping ]
like sleeping in my warm bed
next to my warm brother--

something different every day--

with my friends.
* Any old time **

12:16.870 --> 12:19.072
So there it was.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.842
Giving John what he wanted
was gonna cost me
every dime I had.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.144
But I wasn't just buyin'
a prison prom.

12:24.211 --> 12:26.914
I was buyin' six months

Okay. Fine. Let's do it.

[ Squeals ]
I haven't written
a check in a while.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.422
What do I put
in this memo section?

12:35.488 --> 12:38.158
You're supposed to put
something to remind you
what the check was for,

12:38.225 --> 12:40.293
but I usually just write,
"Suck it, gas company."

12:40.360 --> 12:43.030
[ Earl Narrating ]
I'd never forget
what this check was for,

12:43.096 --> 12:45.933
but I wanted
to write it down anyway.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.705
[ Joy ]
I can't believe this.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.342
I made a prom in prison happen.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.846
I bet this is what
it feels like to be Oprah.

[ Earl Narrating ]
Finally, the big night had come.
** [ Swing Pop ]

13:07.254 --> 13:10.390
Even though no one actually
got to choose their date,

13:10.457 --> 13:13.693
everyone seemed happy
to have some new company--

13:13.760 --> 13:16.229
including me.

13:18.031 --> 13:22.435
Depending on who you asked,
my date, Tanani,
was either in prison...

13:22.502 --> 13:25.939
for protesting the government's
oppressive treatment
of Native Americans...

13:26.006 --> 13:28.608
or for stabbing her boss
at the company picnic.

13:28.675 --> 13:33.013
It may have taken all my money,
but it really was turning out
to be a magical night.

13:33.080 --> 13:35.315
And splurging on the food
really paid off.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.284
This food is awesome, Earl.
Thanks.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.087
People seem
to be enjoyin' it.

'Cause it wasn't just a prom.

something happened that made
a sweet night even sweeter.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.137
We crown Earl Hickey
as prom king...

because he is responsible
for this entire evening,

[ Chanting ]
Earl! Earl! Earl! Earl!

14:38.845 --> 14:41.982
[ Earl Narrating ]
I never thought being
prom king would mean so much,

14:42.049 --> 14:44.817
mostly because I didn't know
proms had kings.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.786
Well, now that I knew it,
it felt great.

I realized this crown would
mean even more to someone else.

- But you know who we should
really be thanking for this--
- Jesus?

15:03.603 --> 15:07.407
Well, okay, but I was
thinking of someone
a little more on our level.

- The pope?
- Okay, church guy.
Stop answering.

He's the real
prom king.

would've ever happened.

Sure, John was prickly
and demanding,

15:39.206 --> 15:43.143
but underneath that,
he was a sad kid who had
missed out on a lot in life,

15:43.210 --> 15:45.878
and I was glad
to give some of it back--

15:45.945 --> 15:49.949

six months of my own life
back too.

gonna make up with your parents.

are pictures of me

Right then something

I don't know if it was
'cause I'd been in prison
