WEBVTT

00:06.750 --> 00:08.417
We're preempting
your normal BabCom service

00:08.500 --> 00:11.250
to bring you another update
in the continuing crisis.

00:11.333 --> 00:13.208
Two more deep-range
planetary colonies

00:13.292 --> 00:16.625
have been eliminated
by Vorlon forces.

00:16.708 --> 00:18.500
'This footage was taken
as the Vorlon fleet'

00:18.583 --> 00:20.583
'closed in on Ventari 3.'

00:20.667 --> 00:22.417
'The ship eclipsing
the local star is presumed'

00:22.500 --> 00:25.333
'to be their main weapon,
a planet killer.'

00:27.208 --> 00:28.750
Below is a list
of nearby colonies

00:28.833 --> 00:30.250
and League Worlds
which are accepting

00:30.333 --> 00:32.083
refugees from Ventari 3.

00:32.167 --> 00:35.958
We will continue to update this
list as the situation changes.

00:36.042 --> 00:38.250
If you are from the
Ventari system, you are asked

00:38.333 --> 00:40.083
not to return until authorized.

00:40.167 --> 00:41.542
The local jump gate
has been destroyed

00:41.625 --> 00:43.500
and hyper space traffic
is creating a hazard

00:43.583 --> 00:45.125
at the jump intersection.

00:45.208 --> 00:48.000
Contact your ambassadors for
information on family members

00:48.083 --> 00:51.458
who may have escaped before
the colony was destroyed.

00:51.542 --> 00:54.792
We're taking in refugees and
escaping ships as fast as we can

00:54.875 --> 00:57.083
but our resources
are almost maxed out.

00:57.167 --> 00:59.625
We will repeat this bulletin
every 20 standard minutes

00:59.708 --> 01:01.792
until we receive
new information.

01:01.875 --> 01:04.583
Once again, please remain calm.

01:04.667 --> 01:07.750
Right now,
our greatest enemy is fear.

01:09.917 --> 01:11.792
[indistinct chatter]

01:11.875 --> 01:14.917
(female #1)
'Please, I need to get through.'

01:15.000 --> 01:17.500
No, I have to get to my husband.

01:17.583 --> 01:19.208
I have to tell him
something because..

01:19.292 --> 01:21.333
[screams]

01:22.750 --> 01:24.958
Can somebody help me, please?

01:29.583 --> 01:31.000
Can..

01:33.417 --> 01:36.458
[intense music]

01:54.917 --> 01:58.000
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:58.083 --> 01:59.917
My God, that was him, wasn't it?

02:00.000 --> 02:02.792
Yeah, that was him.

02:02.875 --> 02:06.625
They, they say
he came back from the dead.

02:06.708 --> 02:09.167
Is it true? Did he?

02:09.250 --> 02:13.208
Lady, I don't know what's true
around here anymore.

02:13.292 --> 02:15.208
Come on, I'll help you through.

02:17.042 --> 02:18.833
- You heard?
- I heard.

02:18.917 --> 02:21.333
- They need to believe.
- Not in me.

02:21.417 --> 02:24.250
- You can't save them all.
- I can try.

02:24.333 --> 02:25.958
- You'll fail.
- We'll see.

02:26.042 --> 02:29.333
..remain calm.
Once again, please remain calm.

02:29.417 --> 02:32.250
Right now,
our greatest enemy is fear.

02:36.125 --> 02:39.167
[intense music]

02:44.458 --> 02:46.292
(Lennier)
It was the year of fire.

02:46.375 --> 02:48.167
(Zack)
The year of destruction.

02:48.250 --> 02:51.125
(G'Kar)
The year we took back
what was ours.

02:51.208 --> 02:53.125
(Lyta)
It was the year of rebirth.

02:53.208 --> 02:55.292
(Vir)
The year of great sadness.

02:55.375 --> 02:57.042
(Marcus)
The year of pain.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.417
(Delenn)
And a year of joy.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.250
(Mollari)
It was a new age.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.250
(Stephen)
It was the end of history.

03:02.333 --> 03:05.292
(Ivanova)
It was the year
everything changed.

03:07.708 --> 03:11.583
(Garibaldi)
The year is 2261, the place..

03:11.667 --> 03:13.625
(Sheridan)
Babylon 5.

03:15.208 --> 03:18.250
[theme music]

03:48.250 --> 03:51.333
[music continues]

04:10.542 --> 04:13.083
[instrumental music]

04:34.250 --> 04:36.208
(Garibaldi)
'Yeah, come in.'

04:38.250 --> 04:41.667
- Hey, chief. How you feeling?
- Fine.

04:41.750 --> 04:43.333
Ready to get back to work
as soon as they decide

04:43.417 --> 04:44.958
to get off their butts
and give the word.

04:45.042 --> 04:46.750
Yeah, that's what I came
to talk to you about.

04:46.833 --> 04:49.625
Just got a call from Ivanova,
and she said, uh..

04:51.708 --> 04:54.167
That's a securecam record.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.542
Thought the doc told you
to take it easy for a while?

04:56.625 --> 04:59.208
Well, I gotta do something
or I'm gonna go stir-crazy.

04:59.292 --> 05:02.667
You, um, keeping an eye
on the captain?

05:02.750 --> 05:05.750
No, on him.

05:05.833 --> 05:07.875
'The guy worries me,
everywhere the captain goes'

05:07.958 --> 05:09.792
'he's there,
right at his heals watching.'

05:09.875 --> 05:11.417
How do we know
he's not pulling something?

05:11.500 --> 05:13.917
Come on.
The captain vouched for him.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.542
Said he saved his life.

05:15.625 --> 05:17.542
I thought he died on Z'Ha'Dum.

05:17.625 --> 05:21.208
Yeah, well, after that part.

05:21.292 --> 05:24.042
Look, I don't pretend
to understand it.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.792
I'm just glad he came
back in one piece.

05:25.875 --> 05:29.042
- You sure you're okay, chief?
- Yes, Zack, I'm fine. Okay?

05:29.125 --> 05:31.208
Why, huh, why does
everybody keep asking me

05:31.292 --> 05:33.083
the same question
every five minutes?

05:33.167 --> 05:35.708
We're just concerned,
that's all.

05:35.792 --> 05:37.958
You've been through a lot and
you say you still don't remember

05:38.042 --> 05:40.000
what happened
after you disappeared.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.917
What do you mean,
I say I still don't remember?

05:42.000 --> 05:43.542
I don't remember.

05:43.625 --> 05:45.958
- You saying I'm lying about it?
- No, chief.

05:46.042 --> 05:49.000
I'm not saying that and
nobody's questioning your word.

05:49.083 --> 05:51.042
Then how come nobody's
grilling the captain, huh?

05:51.125 --> 05:52.833
He breezes in here,
says he's back from the dead

05:52.917 --> 05:54.417
feeling much better,
thank you very much

05:54.500 --> 05:56.875
and everybody buys it.
"Boy, howdy, that's great.

05:56.958 --> 05:58.292
Yes, sir.
Good to have you back."

05:58.375 --> 05:59.792
Meanwhile,
I get the third degree

05:59.875 --> 06:02.583
and "Are you okay, chief?"
every time I sneeze.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.833
Does this make any sense to you?

06:07.500 --> 06:11.042
- You finished?
- For now.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.917
Good, because I got
a message from Ivanova.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.333
Doc wants to take
one more look at you.

06:15.417 --> 06:18.125
After that,
you can come back to work.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.875
Good. About time.

06:23.958 --> 06:26.875
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.167
- Uh, Zack?
- Yeah?

06:30.875 --> 06:32.625
Uh, before I left

06:32.708 --> 06:35.125
the captain and I were
on pretty good terms.

06:35.208 --> 06:37.750
We got to where we could
talk to each other.

06:37.833 --> 06:39.792
Since we both got back

06:39.875 --> 06:41.750
he hasn't said two words to me.

06:41.833 --> 06:45.167
It's like he's avoiding me. Why?

06:45.250 --> 06:48.833
Well, assuming
you're not overreacting..

06:49.875 --> 06:51.500
...I don't know.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.583
But I'm sure
he's got his reasons.

06:57.375 --> 07:00.417
[intense music]

07:19.333 --> 07:20.958
[sighs]

07:21.042 --> 07:22.583
Majesty?

07:25.292 --> 07:27.167
You sent for me?

07:27.250 --> 07:30.125
I was just looking at the sky.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.458
Tell me, what do you see,
Mollari?

07:39.292 --> 07:42.833
The stars, Majesty.
Nothing more.

07:42.917 --> 07:45.292
Then you're not
looking hard enough.

07:46.292 --> 07:48.958
Vorlons are out there, Londo.

07:49.042 --> 07:50.292
They've gone mad.

07:50.375 --> 07:52.542
Attacking any world,
any base, any colony

07:52.625 --> 07:54.917
where my associates
have influence.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.667
Is this true, Majesty?
I've heard nothing.

07:57.750 --> 08:00.083
Yes. Well, we kept
the information to ourselves.

08:00.167 --> 08:02.333
No reason
for anyone else to know.

08:02.417 --> 08:04.708
After the last war,
my associates hid

08:04.792 --> 08:07.333
many of their ships
on distant worlds.

08:07.417 --> 08:10.292
The Vorlons wanna make sure
that doesn't happen again.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.833
There are over a hundred
of those ships here.

08:12.917 --> 08:15.083
I assume
they will be leaving now.

08:15.167 --> 08:17.250
- I'm afraid not.
- The Vorlons--

08:17.333 --> 08:20.625
Will never attack
Centauri Prime.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.292
Small colonies,
deep-range planets, sure.

08:24.375 --> 08:28.083
But to destroy a world
as big as this? No.

08:28.167 --> 08:30.375
- They don't have the will.
- Perhaps.

08:30.458 --> 08:33.750
But we cannot take the chance
that you might be wrong.

08:33.833 --> 08:36.292
The ships must leave, Majesty.

08:36.375 --> 08:38.250
(Morden)
The ships stay.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.917
As our liaison here,
you will arrange

08:40.000 --> 08:43.833
for a blockade of ships
around Centauri Prime.

08:43.917 --> 08:46.500
The Vorlons don't want
lots of civilian casualties.

08:46.583 --> 08:49.292
If they see that
you're ready to oppose them

08:49.375 --> 08:51.500
they'll just keep on going.

08:51.583 --> 08:54.292
- Majesty.
- Do as he says, Mollari.

08:54.375 --> 08:57.083
We must be courteous
to our guests.

08:57.167 --> 09:00.250
Thank you. Now,
if you'll excuse me, Majesty.

09:01.125 --> 09:03.292
Goodnight, Londo.

09:07.542 --> 09:09.708
Majesty, this is intolerable.

09:09.792 --> 09:12.958
To send our people out
to defend their ships?

09:13.042 --> 09:15.458
You get so exercised
at times like this, Mollari.

09:15.542 --> 09:17.375
I wish I had a picture
of your face right now.

09:17.458 --> 09:20.458
- This is serious.
- Of course it is.

09:20.542 --> 09:24.500
And I have no intention
of sending our ships out there.

09:24.583 --> 09:27.375
- You don't?
- Of course not.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.333
Walk with me.

09:36.083 --> 09:38.125
Majesty, you don't
know how relieved I am

09:38.208 --> 09:40.792
to hear you say that,
I was hoping you would see

09:40.875 --> 09:42.875
this situation for what it is.

09:42.958 --> 09:46.833
Yes. Yes, I've come to
the same conclusion you have.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.458
It was all so obvious
once I set my mind to it

09:49.542 --> 09:52.208
which is why I've decided
I like you, Mollari.

09:52.292 --> 09:53.917
You think the same way I do.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.292
Thank you, Majesty, but now--

09:55.375 --> 09:57.417
In fact, I've decided
to show you something

09:57.500 --> 10:00.042
I've shown only
a few people before.

10:00.750 --> 10:02.333
Yes.

10:02.417 --> 10:04.083
This way.

10:09.458 --> 10:11.125
This way.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.417
Sit, Mollari, sit.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.875
I call them my Shadow Cabinet.

10:27.958 --> 10:30.083
I think you can
appreciate the irony.

10:30.167 --> 10:32.208
'They certainly can't.'

10:32.292 --> 10:35.250
Sit. Mollari, sit.

10:36.542 --> 10:38.542
'We were discussing
this situation'

10:38.625 --> 10:41.708
earlier this evening
and this one had the most..

10:41.792 --> 10:43.583
No, no.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.583
This one.

10:45.667 --> 10:48.333
Minister Dugarri.

10:48.417 --> 10:51.042
You remember him, don't you?
Always coughing.

10:51.125 --> 10:54.125
Most distressing,
but we finally cured it.

10:55.125 --> 10:57.417
Had the most wonderful idea.

10:57.500 --> 11:00.292
We won't be sending any of our
ships out to fight the Vorlons.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.042
Not one.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.875
Then you will tell Mr. Morden's
associates to leave?

11:04.958 --> 11:06.333
Of course not.

11:06.417 --> 11:07.708
I promised them they could stay

11:07.792 --> 11:09.375
in exchange for
elevating me to Godhood.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.417
No, they will remain
on the Island of Celini.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.292
But when the Vorlons come

11:13.375 --> 11:15.750
if they are destroying
whole planets

11:15.833 --> 11:17.167
to get at these Shadows--

11:17.250 --> 11:18.750
Yes.

11:18.833 --> 11:21.292
You understand exactly.

11:21.375 --> 11:23.000
Snicks?

11:24.208 --> 11:26.833
You and I, Mollari.

11:26.917 --> 11:30.042
'We will turn Centauri Prime'

11:30.125 --> 11:32.167
'into an inauguration pyre'

11:32.250 --> 11:34.417
to commemorate
my ascension into Godhood.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.208
The fire of our world
will light my way.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.458
'Yes. You see it, don't you?'

11:42.667 --> 11:44.167
If I become a God

11:44.250 --> 11:46.750
how will our world
survive without me?

11:46.833 --> 11:48.583
I cannot just abandon it.
That would be cruel.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.542
And any who followed me
would obviously be inferior.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.542
Best to put them
out of their misery.

11:53.625 --> 11:55.875
I will take it
all with me in spirit.

11:55.958 --> 11:58.083
Don't send the ships.

11:58.167 --> 12:00.292
Let it burn, Mollari.

12:00.375 --> 12:03.167
Let it all end in fire.

12:06.917 --> 12:09.958
[instrumental music]

12:21.875 --> 12:23.917
(Stephen)
Cough.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.583
Take a deep breath.

12:27.667 --> 12:30.000
And exhale.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.917
Quack like a duck.

12:34.167 --> 12:36.833
Sorry.
A little med-school humor.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.542
So how's it look?
Can I get back to work?

12:38.625 --> 12:42.083
Well, so far,
everything seems to be fine.

12:42.167 --> 12:43.583
There's one more
thing I wanna check, though.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.125
Oh, now, come on, man.
I really hate that.

12:46.208 --> 12:48.292
Don't worry. It's not that.

12:50.917 --> 12:53.292
Alright, this is gonna
get a little hot.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.833
It's gonna sting a bit,
but I, uh, have to get

12:55.917 --> 12:58.583
underneath the epidermis.

12:58.667 --> 13:01.833
Yeah, well, like I said.
This is almost through here.

13:03.625 --> 13:06.833
- What's this for?
- Well..

13:06.917 --> 13:09.292
Your fighter disappeared
while we were

13:09.375 --> 13:11.583
surrounded by Shadow vessels.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.542
Now if you were
taken by one of them

13:13.625 --> 13:15.750
and they wanted to program
you for using their ship

13:15.833 --> 13:19.167
there'd be considerable
scarring back there.

13:20.083 --> 13:21.042
Is that what you think happened?

13:21.125 --> 13:22.583
No, no, not necessarily.

13:22.667 --> 13:25.917
But the captain asked me
to check all possibilities.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.875
You're clean.

13:27.958 --> 13:30.042
So, what do you think happened?

13:30.125 --> 13:31.875
I've been thinking
about it a lot.

13:31.958 --> 13:33.292
My guess is that
when they pulled out

13:33.375 --> 13:34.542
I got caught in the backwash

13:34.625 --> 13:37.208
before they jumped
to hyperspace.

13:37.292 --> 13:38.625
That would explain
how my ship ended up

13:38.708 --> 13:40.000
12 light years from here.

13:40.083 --> 13:42.792
After that...I don't know.

13:44.292 --> 13:45.917
Well, with any luck, uh

13:46.000 --> 13:47.500
it should come back
to you eventually, huh?

13:47.583 --> 13:48.542
Yeah.

13:48.625 --> 13:51.250
In the meantime,
as far as I can tell

13:51.333 --> 13:53.000
you're ready to go back to work.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.000
[intense music]

14:02.458 --> 14:04.167
Yeah.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.458
Uh, thanks, doc.

14:06.542 --> 14:08.417
Gotta go.

14:08.500 --> 14:10.625
It's good to have you back.

14:19.542 --> 14:21.792
Any results yet on my tests?

14:28.167 --> 14:29.958
This is a Command
and Control update.

14:30.042 --> 14:32.333
The safe haven for refugees
on Tizino Prime

14:32.417 --> 14:34.375
is no longer responding.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.667
We believe they may have
fallen to the Vorlon advance

14:38.750 --> 14:40.833
but we can't be sure for another

14:40.917 --> 14:43.458
I guess, 10, 12, hours.

14:43.542 --> 14:45.792
Before they attack, the Vorlons
blanket all frequencies

14:45.875 --> 14:48.333
so no reports can get out.

14:48.417 --> 14:50.833
There have been some changes
in the list of refugee stations.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.250
We'll have that information
for you shortly.

14:53.333 --> 14:55.292
We've lost three of them.

14:55.375 --> 14:56.833
All the governments
in Sector 57

14:56.917 --> 14:59.625
have declared a state
of interplanetary emergency.

14:59.708 --> 15:02.750
[instrumental music]

15:04.625 --> 15:06.583
'Reports coming
in from survivors indicate'

15:06.667 --> 15:09.292
mass destruction
on a planetary scale.

15:09.375 --> 15:12.167
We continue to need
medical ships, transports

15:12.250 --> 15:15.250
anything that can fly.

15:15.333 --> 15:17.792
We're in special need
of atmosphere-capable shuttles

15:17.875 --> 15:20.375
to evacuate survivors
from the ground.

15:20.458 --> 15:23.417
We'll rebroadcast this message
in 20 standard minutes.

15:24.417 --> 15:26.083
[sighs]
You heard?

15:26.167 --> 15:29.208
- Yes, the shuttles--
- No, not the shuttles.

15:30.083 --> 15:33.500
Her voice. She's afraid.

15:33.583 --> 15:36.125
I've known Ivanova almost
ten years, on and off

15:36.208 --> 15:39.083
I've...never heard
her afraid before.

15:48.958 --> 15:50.750
Well, this is the first
time I've seen you

15:50.833 --> 15:52.958
alone since I got back.

15:53.042 --> 15:56.125
Everything has been so busy.
There has hardly been time.

16:00.125 --> 16:02.208
I thought I'd lost you.

16:03.250 --> 16:05.958
I thought it was my fault.

16:06.042 --> 16:09.542
I knew Anna might be alive.
I said nothing, you went away.

16:10.875 --> 16:14.042
The only thing that might be
as terrible as losing you

16:14.125 --> 16:17.917
would be if you came back
and could not forgive me

16:18.000 --> 16:20.917
'and I lost you again.'

16:21.000 --> 16:23.500
You did what
you thought was right.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.625
That's no excuse.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.125
I'm sorry, John.

16:30.458 --> 16:34.042
I fell at Z'Ha'Dum, Delenn.

16:34.125 --> 16:36.583
I saw my own death
and accepted it.

16:36.667 --> 16:40.167
I looked up and saw Anna.
Wha-what was left of Anna.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.750
At that moment..

16:43.833 --> 16:45.542
...I said goodbye.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.958
The goodbye I could
never say before.

16:48.042 --> 16:50.542
I let it all go.

16:50.625 --> 16:53.083
I only held on to one thing.

16:55.208 --> 16:57.833
The image of your sweet face.

16:59.625 --> 17:01.875
If I never came back..

17:02.667 --> 17:04.625
...that was enough.

17:05.833 --> 17:08.667
But you gave me
a reason to come back.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.000
Could I love
that much and not forgive?

17:19.667 --> 17:22.708
[instrumental music]

17:32.208 --> 17:34.875
We're up to our ears in ships,
and not just warships.

17:34.958 --> 17:36.458
Every refugee transport
for ten light years

17:36.542 --> 17:37.792
in any direction is coming here.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.375
I know. Med lab's jammed.

17:39.458 --> 17:40.750
We got wounded
backed up into the hallways

17:40.833 --> 17:42.792
and more coming in
on every shuttle.

17:42.875 --> 17:44.125
In a few days,
the wounded are gonna be

17:44.208 --> 17:45.500
the least of your concerns.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.000
(Ivanova)
'How so?'

17:47.083 --> 17:48.500
It's the only place
where somebody's races

17:48.583 --> 17:49.833
can find their own kind.

17:49.917 --> 17:51.458
So they're all gonna come here.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.250
Especially since
somebody decided Sheridan

17:53.333 --> 17:55.083
is a Second Coming
or some damn thing.

17:55.167 --> 17:56.625
Well, they think
he can do something.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.208
Have you seen
the same reports I have?

17:58.292 --> 17:59.750
There's not a damn thing
we can do to stop

17:59.833 --> 18:01.625
that fleet from
doing anything it wants to.

18:01.708 --> 18:03.958
When they decide
it's our turn, that's it.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.833
Meanwhile,
you're gonna be swamped.

18:05.917 --> 18:07.375
This place can handle
a quarter-million people.

18:07.458 --> 18:08.833
We're already past that.

18:08.917 --> 18:10.750
'What're you gonna do when ten,
twenty thousand people'

18:10.833 --> 18:13.417
'at a time start showing up at
our front door and wanting in?'

18:13.500 --> 18:15.125
What happens when it turns
ugly when they start

18:15.208 --> 18:17.333
fighting each other
for the right to get in here?

18:17.417 --> 18:19.250
You think you got
a security problem now?

18:19.333 --> 18:22.667
Wait another 24 hours.
This'll seem like a picnic.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.917
- What about Epsilon 3?
- 'What about it?'

18:25.000 --> 18:26.292
(Stephen)
'We have a whole planet
underneath us'

18:26.375 --> 18:28.125
that's never been
touched by the Shadows.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.792
So, in theory, the Vorlons
should leave it alone.

18:30.875 --> 18:32.708
We can start shuttling
people down there right now.

18:32.792 --> 18:34.583
I could set up
a portable Med lab.

18:34.667 --> 18:35.917
There's gotta be
supplies down there.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.000
Since we've never seen anyone

18:37.083 --> 18:38.375
bringin' in food or equipment.

18:38.458 --> 18:40.667
I agree!

18:40.750 --> 18:42.167
Do it.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.375
Well, where's your new best pal?

18:44.917 --> 18:46.875
Busy.

18:47.000 --> 18:50.125
We don't have a lot of time,
so I'll get right to the point.

18:50.208 --> 18:52.542
Michael, we have
a security problem.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.000
The new Vorlon ambassador.

18:55.083 --> 18:58.042
As long as he's here,
watching and reporting back

18:58.125 --> 19:00.958
we can't do what's necessary
to stop these attacks.

19:01.042 --> 19:02.875
Which is?

19:02.958 --> 19:04.917
I can't tell you.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.042
So you're saying
you can't trust me?

19:07.125 --> 19:09.792
[sighs]
No, that is not
what I am saying.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.917
We don't know how telepathic
the Vorlons are.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.542
We know they can
project thoughts

19:14.625 --> 19:16.833
but how well they can read
is an open question.

19:16.917 --> 19:19.833
Now, if I tell you and he can
pick up on your thoughts..

19:20.708 --> 19:22.125
...then we've had it.

19:22.208 --> 19:24.833
That's why I've kept you out
of the strategy sessions.

19:25.958 --> 19:28.083
Okay, what do you want me to do?

19:29.542 --> 19:31.458
I want the Vorlon gone.

19:31.542 --> 19:35.167
Fine. I'll just, uh, go up
to him and ask him to leave.

19:35.250 --> 19:36.750
- That'll work.
- Michael.

19:36.833 --> 19:40.375
It's alright. That's exactly
what I want you to do.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.417
Look, he's got to know
by now that we're planning

19:42.500 --> 19:45.542
to move against him, so let's
give him what he expects.

19:46.667 --> 19:48.917
Then we can do
what we have to do.

19:49.000 --> 19:51.417
Which is the part
you can't tell me about.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.417
[exhales sharply]
Do you want me to take
a full tactical team?

19:56.500 --> 19:59.167
No, just a few people
you can trust.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.750
That's not enough.
He'll wipe the floor with us.

20:04.833 --> 20:06.458
I know.

20:08.458 --> 20:09.542
Swell.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.292
Okay, uh..

20:11.375 --> 20:13.875
Look, if you want me
to fall on my sword for you

20:13.958 --> 20:15.542
that's what I'm here for.

20:15.625 --> 20:16.958
I'll let you know
what happens

20:17.042 --> 20:20.292
assuming he doesn't frag me
just for kicks.

20:23.583 --> 20:25.708
Is it my imagination
or is Mr. Garibaldi

20:25.792 --> 20:27.083
crankier than usual?

20:27.167 --> 20:29.208
Yeah, well, he's been
through a lot lately.

20:29.292 --> 20:32.125
He just needs a little time
to settle in, that's all.

20:34.708 --> 20:37.792
[insturmental music]

20:40.292 --> 20:41.792
We're ready.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.083
Has Lorien explained
everything to you?

20:44.167 --> 20:46.792
I don't know if I can do this,
but I will try.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.375
(Lorien)
'Remember, Sheridan.'

20:48.458 --> 20:50.125
The Shadows were
able to kill Kosh

20:50.208 --> 20:52.833
because they're alike,
both First Ones.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.625
For you, this will
be much more difficult.

20:55.708 --> 20:57.875
You've never seen
a Vorlon enraged.

20:57.958 --> 21:00.708
They're more powerful
than you can imagine.

21:00.792 --> 21:04.792
Uh, captain, what exactly
are we talking about here?

21:07.417 --> 21:10.625
Millions of people's lives
are at stake here, Stephen.

21:10.708 --> 21:14.583
If the ambassador stays,
billions more will die.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.792
So we're going to
take out the Vorlon..

21:17.875 --> 21:20.167
...any way we can.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.958
[intense music]

21:45.208 --> 21:46.708
This is Babylon 5
Command and Control.

21:46.792 --> 21:49.792
We have another update
on the Vorlon attack fleet.

21:49.875 --> 21:51.667
The Dura 7 outpost has fallen.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.875
I repeat, Dura 7 has fallen.

21:53.958 --> 21:56.125
All medical ships in the area
are being asked to help

21:56.208 --> 21:58.167
with the evacuation.

22:01.833 --> 22:04.875
[intense music]

22:07.375 --> 22:08.833
Ambassador.

22:10.375 --> 22:13.417
Ambassador, this is Security.
We need to talk to you.

22:26.292 --> 22:28.042
I got a message
from the captain.

22:28.125 --> 22:29.500
Because of your government's
recent attacks

22:29.583 --> 22:31.167
on the League
of Non-Aligned Worlds

22:31.250 --> 22:33.875
we're asking you
to leave at once.

22:40.792 --> 22:41.958
Alright.

22:42.042 --> 22:44.083
That request
just became an order.

22:44.167 --> 22:47.125
You'll come with us.
We'll escort you to your ship.

22:48.917 --> 22:50.333
No.

22:55.917 --> 22:57.792
[zapping]

22:57.875 --> 22:59.833
Fire!

23:00.417 --> 23:02.458
[zapping]

23:06.625 --> 23:08.667
[crackling]

23:16.125 --> 23:17.833
[grunting]
Out! Out! Everybody out!

23:17.917 --> 23:21.125
Go, go, go! Get out of here!

23:21.208 --> 23:23.292
Everybody out! Go!

23:23.375 --> 23:24.958
Move!

23:27.375 --> 23:29.417
[coughing]

23:39.417 --> 23:42.125
- You okay?
- Never better.

23:42.208 --> 23:45.000
Man, we couldn't even touch him.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.750
I know, well, if they wanted him
to think we weren't a threat

23:47.833 --> 23:49.333
that ought to do it, huh?

23:49.417 --> 23:51.542
I just hope the captain
knows what he's doing.

23:51.625 --> 23:53.500
Alright, come on.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.250
[coughing]

24:04.750 --> 24:07.000
[automated message]
'Incoming message
for you, captain.'

24:07.083 --> 24:08.833
'It's Ambassador Mollari.'

24:08.917 --> 24:10.333
Londo?

24:10.417 --> 24:13.167
Probably calling collect.
Did he say what he wants?

24:13.250 --> 24:15.000
[automated message]
'Negative.'

24:16.583 --> 24:18.583
Alright, put him through.

24:19.583 --> 24:20.917
Good day, captain.

24:21.000 --> 24:22.667
Ambassador,
what can I do for you?

24:22.750 --> 24:26.125
I need a favor.
Some information.

24:26.208 --> 24:29.375
There is a rumor that
the Vorlons have gone mad

24:29.458 --> 24:31.458
attacking every colony,
every planet

24:31.542 --> 24:33.583
involved with the Shadows?

24:33.667 --> 24:35.125
It's no rumor.

24:35.208 --> 24:39.208
We've been tracking their
attacks for the past two days.

24:39.292 --> 24:42.708
Then could you tell me how far
they are from Centauri Prime?

24:42.792 --> 24:44.708
Don't your people
have that information?

24:44.792 --> 24:49.208
Yes, but it is not exactly
being widely distributed.

24:49.292 --> 24:53.500
And so I ask you
how long until they reach here?

24:54.417 --> 24:56.708
The way they've been going now..

24:56.792 --> 24:59.125
...I'd say seven days,
eight tops.

24:59.208 --> 25:01.583
Seven days.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.667
And can I assume
that you are already

25:04.750 --> 25:07.250
in the process
of doing something about this?

25:07.333 --> 25:08.542
Yes, but we won't have anything

25:08.625 --> 25:10.333
put into place
before they get here.

25:10.417 --> 25:12.167
Now, we have an idea.

25:12.250 --> 25:14.417
But there's no guarantee
we can pull it off.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.458
No, of course not.
There never is.

25:18.458 --> 25:21.000
Well, thank you, captain.

25:21.083 --> 25:23.208
I owe you a favor.

25:24.250 --> 25:27.167
Good luck to you. To all of us.

25:35.542 --> 25:38.750
I heard what happened.
I came to warn you.

25:38.833 --> 25:42.167
Sheridan and the others
are gonna move against you.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.500
It is done.

25:44.583 --> 25:47.292
They are irrelevant.

25:47.375 --> 25:49.375
I know, I know
they can't harm you

25:49.458 --> 25:51.958
but I was thinking it can't hurt
to have all the information

25:52.042 --> 25:53.958
you can about what's going on.

25:54.042 --> 25:56.917
To protect yourself
and the cause.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.458
- How?
- I told you.

25:58.542 --> 26:01.542
I wasn't here
when Ambassador Kosh died.

26:01.625 --> 26:03.667
I didn't have
any of his essence with me.

26:03.750 --> 26:05.458
I thought he was gone.

26:05.542 --> 26:07.208
But for a while,
I've suspected that

26:07.292 --> 26:09.625
someone else here
had a piece of him.

26:09.708 --> 26:11.292
I think I know who it is.

26:11.375 --> 26:14.792
But I can't draw Kosh
out of him. He won't let me.

26:14.875 --> 26:17.417
- A human?
- Yes.

26:17.500 --> 26:20.708
- Imprisons one of us?
- Yes.

26:21.458 --> 26:23.292
Intolerable.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.042
If there is still
a piece of him there

26:25.125 --> 26:26.500
you can draw it out of him.

26:26.583 --> 26:28.333
Use what it knows
and take it back

26:28.417 --> 26:31.042
to Vorlon when this is all over.

26:31.125 --> 26:33.000
I cared about Kosh.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.458
I'd like to know
he finally made it home.

26:36.375 --> 26:38.000
Show me.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.667
But the guards.

26:39.750 --> 26:43.417
They will not
threaten us again.

26:43.500 --> 26:45.125
Show me.

26:46.750 --> 26:49.833
[instrumental music]

27:20.125 --> 27:23.208
[music continues]

27:28.333 --> 27:30.083
It's this way.

27:30.167 --> 27:31.250
We have to hurry.

27:31.333 --> 27:33.625
I think he might leave soon.

27:33.708 --> 27:35.625
Your thoughts are troubled.

27:35.708 --> 27:37.167
I'm worried about Kosh,
that's all.

27:37.250 --> 27:38.583
After everything
we've been through

27:38.667 --> 27:41.375
I'd hate to lose
the last of him now, and..

27:41.458 --> 27:44.125
What are you hiding?

27:44.208 --> 27:45.625
Nothing.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.708
Open your thoughts to me.

27:49.792 --> 27:53.125
- We don't have time for this.
- Open!

27:58.375 --> 28:00.417
[whirring]

28:08.333 --> 28:09.833
[intense music]

28:09.917 --> 28:11.417
Lyta, run!

28:11.500 --> 28:12.917
Now!

28:13.708 --> 28:15.750
[crackling]

28:16.875 --> 28:18.292
Come on!

28:19.083 --> 28:20.792
Second Team!

28:23.333 --> 28:25.333
[zapping]

28:38.083 --> 28:41.125
[intense music]

28:54.333 --> 28:56.375
[crackling]

29:05.583 --> 29:07.625
[shrieking]

29:16.083 --> 29:17.958
[shrieking]

29:19.208 --> 29:20.667
[shrieking]

29:20.750 --> 29:22.750
[zapping]

29:27.292 --> 29:28.750
[shrieking]

29:28.833 --> 29:30.250
Ow!

29:34.000 --> 29:36.083
[indistinct shouting]

29:37.958 --> 29:40.542
We need more current down here.
Give me everything you got!

29:40.625 --> 29:42.667
I'm re-routing the power coils.

29:42.750 --> 29:45.083
- What the hell is that?
- Control, this is Bay 13.

29:45.167 --> 29:46.625
The Vorlon ship
is breaking free.

29:46.708 --> 29:48.833
- It's like it's alive!
- Get your people out of there!

29:48.917 --> 29:51.917
Clear the Vorlon ship to leave
before it tears the place apart.

29:54.792 --> 29:56.833
[shrieking]

29:59.375 --> 30:02.417
[intense music]

30:08.542 --> 30:10.375
Delenn!

30:17.250 --> 30:18.917
John?

30:22.500 --> 30:24.542
[whizzing]

30:27.417 --> 30:29.083
John!

30:32.250 --> 30:33.958
Now!

30:36.583 --> 30:39.625
[intense music]

30:43.333 --> 30:45.375
[shreiking]

30:48.833 --> 30:51.542
(Delenn)
'It's Kosh.'

30:51.625 --> 30:53.083
Kosh was inside him?

30:53.167 --> 30:55.833
Yes, the last of Kosh.

30:55.917 --> 30:58.875
And some of him and some of me.

31:09.667 --> 31:12.708
[music continues]

31:19.625 --> 31:21.667
[explosion]

31:22.542 --> 31:24.917
Is everyone okay?

31:25.000 --> 31:27.375
Captain, is everything
alright? Captain?

31:27.458 --> 31:30.000
- John!
- No, wait.

31:31.125 --> 31:34.417
His life force
must be replenished.

31:47.292 --> 31:49.958
Is this how you brought him
back from Z'Ha'Dum?

31:51.042 --> 31:54.333
I give of myself
to replenish him.

31:56.375 --> 31:58.792
For a little while.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.583
How long?

32:02.125 --> 32:03.917
Long enough.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.792
[groaning]

32:13.083 --> 32:16.125
[instrumental music]

32:45.833 --> 32:49.042
I'm not used to being summoned
on such short notice.

32:49.125 --> 32:52.125
I hope you have good reason
for this intrusion.

32:52.208 --> 32:54.542
I do, I was thinking about

32:54.625 --> 32:57.042
Your Majesty's coming Godhood

32:57.125 --> 33:00.542
which is possibly
the single greatest event

33:00.625 --> 33:03.000
in the history
of the Centauri Republic.

33:03.083 --> 33:05.583
A great thing.

33:05.667 --> 33:08.708
Well, as I say, I was
thinking about all of this

33:08.792 --> 33:12.375
and wishing that others
could know you

33:12.458 --> 33:13.667
as our people know you.

33:13.750 --> 33:17.125
If only they could see
your greatness as we do.

33:17.208 --> 33:19.458
Why should we care
what other people think?

33:19.542 --> 33:24.042
Well, after the Vorlons have
eliminated Centauri Prime

33:24.125 --> 33:26.250
which we will be
most happy to fall.

33:26.333 --> 33:28.917
You were correct
about that, Majesty.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.708
Who will be left
to sing your praises?

33:32.792 --> 33:36.375
Who will know you
for who you are?

33:36.458 --> 33:38.333
A God is a God, yes

33:38.417 --> 33:40.875
but if no one knows his name

33:40.958 --> 33:43.792
visits his temples,
sings his songs..

33:45.917 --> 33:49.250
Once we are gone,
who will remember

33:49.333 --> 33:51.917
the living God Cartagia?

33:54.833 --> 33:57.750
I find these thoughts of yours
most disturbing.

33:57.833 --> 33:59.667
As I did, Majesty.

33:59.750 --> 34:01.792
And what do you propose?

34:01.875 --> 34:04.625
That you leave Centauri Prime

34:04.708 --> 34:06.125
before the Vorlons arrive?

34:06.208 --> 34:09.750
That you might better
remember me at a distance?

34:09.833 --> 34:11.333
No, no, of course not.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.625
[laughing]

34:13.708 --> 34:17.708
Y-your Majesty's humor, as
always, is quite exceptional.

34:17.792 --> 34:19.417
No, my place is at your side.

34:19.500 --> 34:22.708
However, I was
thinking about G'Kar.

34:22.792 --> 34:24.792
The Narn? Why?

34:24.875 --> 34:26.208
He'll be dead in a few days,
I don't think

34:26.292 --> 34:28.042
he'll be remembering
very much after that.

34:28.125 --> 34:29.250
True.

34:29.333 --> 34:31.333
And he deserves
to die for his crimes

34:31.417 --> 34:34.667
against our people,
and die he will.

34:36.042 --> 34:39.167
But what if we conducted

34:39.250 --> 34:41.792
his trial and execution

34:41.875 --> 34:44.958
on his Home World
instead of here?

34:45.042 --> 34:47.667
The whole world would see

34:47.750 --> 34:48.917
Your Majesty's wisdom.

34:49.000 --> 34:52.833
See with their own eyes,
the brilliant center

34:52.917 --> 34:54.000
of the Centauri Republic.

34:54.083 --> 34:57.625
'Can you imagine
how it would move them?'

34:57.708 --> 34:59.542
Once they see you

34:59.625 --> 35:01.333
sit in judgment over G'Kar

35:01.417 --> 35:04.583
your name will spread
like wildfire among them.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.250
And from there
to a hundred planets beyond.

35:07.333 --> 35:11.167
Then you can accept
your imminent Godhood

35:11.250 --> 35:14.500
secure that your name
will be spoken

35:14.583 --> 35:17.708
and remembered throughout
the known galaxy.

35:19.042 --> 35:21.833
I have occasionally
considered a trip to Narn.

35:21.917 --> 35:25.000
My advisers counseled against
it for security reasons.

35:25.083 --> 35:28.125
Majesty, can you harm a God?

35:28.208 --> 35:29.667
It would be a great crime

35:29.750 --> 35:32.917
for one who will shortly
walk among the stars

35:33.000 --> 35:36.958
who will hold entire worlds
in the palm of his hand

35:37.042 --> 35:40.417
to be mistakenly
perceived as being afraid

35:40.500 --> 35:43.375
of a few barbarians.

35:43.458 --> 35:44.875
Hmm.

35:51.708 --> 35:54.125
You have raised
a good point, Mollari.

35:55.708 --> 35:58.208
Once again, I am in your debt.

35:58.292 --> 36:00.625
'I am told the Vorlons
will arrive in seven days.'

36:00.708 --> 36:01.875
This is just enough time.

36:01.958 --> 36:03.333
Three days there,
three days back

36:03.417 --> 36:05.125
one day for trial and execution.

36:05.208 --> 36:07.458
Half a day.
His guilt is obvious.

36:07.542 --> 36:10.500
But we must allow
them proper time

36:10.583 --> 36:12.417
to see me for what I am.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.083
Of course, Majesty.

36:14.167 --> 36:17.917
You are, as always, quite right.

36:18.000 --> 36:20.917
And I will go
with you to personally

36:21.000 --> 36:24.542
end the life of Citizen G'Kar.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.042
[insturmental music]

36:35.375 --> 36:37.750
That, that was a hell
of a lot of ships.

36:37.833 --> 36:39.417
And more on the way.

36:39.500 --> 36:41.208
The captain wants
the biggest fleet in history

36:41.292 --> 36:42.875
if we're gonna end this war.

36:42.958 --> 36:44.208
The way things
are shaping up out there

36:44.292 --> 36:45.750
it looks like
he just might get it.

36:45.833 --> 36:47.375
And then what?

36:47.458 --> 36:48.750
And then what, what?

36:48.833 --> 36:50.417
Well, if we lose,
there is no "Then what"

36:50.500 --> 36:53.000
and if we win, what next?
We're still renegades.

36:53.083 --> 36:54.458
I don't think there's anybody
left on this side

36:54.542 --> 36:57.417
of the Galactic Core
we haven't already honked off.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.208
We can't go home.

36:59.292 --> 37:00.750
Sometimes I don't know
which scares me more

37:00.833 --> 37:02.458
winning or losing.

37:02.542 --> 37:04.875
God, I thought I was depressing.

37:13.542 --> 37:18.042
John, Ivanova told me
that you wanted to see me.

37:18.125 --> 37:21.125
Yes, there's something..

37:23.167 --> 37:25.292
...I didn't want
to tell you at first

37:25.375 --> 37:28.667
but when I heard
what you asked Lorien..

37:28.750 --> 37:30.167
Well, you have a right to know.

37:30.250 --> 37:32.167
To know what?

37:34.292 --> 37:37.583
He was gravely
wounded at Z'Ha'Dum.

37:37.667 --> 37:39.375
He was dying.

37:39.458 --> 37:40.875
He was dead.

37:40.958 --> 37:45.125
'I did all I could to help him,
but I cannot create life.'

37:45.208 --> 37:47.667
'Only the universe can do that.'

37:47.750 --> 37:51.250
I can extend, enhance.

37:51.333 --> 37:54.125
There is no magic,
nothing spiritual about it

37:54.208 --> 37:56.125
only the application of energies

37:56.208 --> 37:58.667
healing and rebuilding cells.

37:58.750 --> 38:01.708
I had Franklin
do a complete medscan.

38:03.125 --> 38:05.875
He found things
in my neurosystem.

38:05.958 --> 38:08.167
Some kind of biochemical energy

38:08.250 --> 38:10.250
repairing and sustaining me.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.375
'H-h-he's never seen
anything like it.'

38:12.458 --> 38:14.542
(Lorien)
'I did the best I could.'

38:14.625 --> 38:17.375
I gave him back
a portion of his life

38:17.458 --> 38:20.125
but only a portion.

38:21.333 --> 38:23.208
How long?

38:26.958 --> 38:29.375
In human terms, barring injury

38:29.458 --> 38:33.458
and illness, perhaps 20 years.

38:33.542 --> 38:35.667
'But no more than that.'

38:35.750 --> 38:37.375
Twenty years.

38:37.458 --> 38:40.208
(Sheridan)
I'll be in my early 60s by then.

38:40.292 --> 38:42.667
It's a, it's a good run, Delenn.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.292
You told me that
humans live to be

38:44.375 --> 38:46.875
a hundred years old, even older.

38:46.958 --> 38:49.250
- You can't--
- Twenty years.

38:49.333 --> 38:50.833
No more.

38:50.917 --> 38:53.917
And then, one day

38:54.000 --> 38:56.583
he will simply..

38:56.667 --> 38:58.500
...stop.

39:04.667 --> 39:06.833
Can we have a moment?

39:21.333 --> 39:23.333
It's alright, Delenn.

39:24.792 --> 39:26.458
I went into this
with my eyes open.

39:26.542 --> 39:28.500
I knew if I went to Z'Ha'Dum

39:28.583 --> 39:30.583
there'd be a price.

39:31.833 --> 39:34.250
Seems there's always a price.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.375
I'm okay with this.

39:38.458 --> 39:41.208
But I'm not okay with this.

39:41.292 --> 39:44.375
I told you I was afraid
that I would get you back..

39:44.458 --> 39:46.125
...only to lose you.

39:46.208 --> 39:48.500
And that's what this is.

39:48.583 --> 39:50.167
Twenty years.

39:50.250 --> 39:51.792
It's a long time.

39:51.875 --> 39:55.000
It's 20 more years
than I would've had.

39:55.083 --> 39:58.083
A-and at least..

39:58.167 --> 40:01.125
At least I can spend most
of them with you.

40:04.250 --> 40:07.208
That's why
I wanted to see you alone.

40:12.292 --> 40:15.250
Here it is.
Man, I thought I'd lost it.

40:18.917 --> 40:21.042
I, uh..

40:21.125 --> 40:23.333
I wanted you to have this.

40:25.458 --> 40:27.583
I got it down in the Zocalo.

40:27.667 --> 40:31.875
It's not what
I had exactly in mind, but, uh..

40:33.417 --> 40:35.708
It's temporary
until I can get you

40:35.792 --> 40:38.292
a real engagement ring.

40:39.125 --> 40:41.875
Uh, it-it's an Earth custom.

40:44.042 --> 40:47.542
You see,
you give someone you love..

40:49.875 --> 40:51.417
...an engagement ring as kind of

40:51.500 --> 40:54.667
a down payment for another ring.

40:54.750 --> 40:57.458
The kind that..

40:57.542 --> 41:00.083
...you exchange
when you get married.

41:04.792 --> 41:06.208
I don't know when
we'll be able to get around

41:06.292 --> 41:08.333
to that part of it.

41:08.417 --> 41:11.583
We may not survive
the next two weeks.

41:13.167 --> 41:15.542
But I wanted you to
have this and for you

41:15.625 --> 41:19.000
to know that
whatever time I have left..

41:21.625 --> 41:23.875
...I wanna spend it with you.

41:23.958 --> 41:27.000
[instrumental music]

41:39.083 --> 41:41.417
Oh, Majesty, there you are.

41:41.500 --> 41:43.583
I have spoken
to our people on Narn.

41:43.667 --> 41:46.375
They are anxiously
awaiting our arrival.

41:46.458 --> 41:48.167
Good. Good.

41:48.250 --> 41:50.958
I was just making sure
nothing went wrong at this end.

41:51.042 --> 41:52.917
Trouble with being infallible
is you have to put up

41:53.000 --> 41:55.750
with everyone else
making mistakes.

41:57.917 --> 42:02.500
I was just thinking, I-I don't
like the way he's looking at me.

42:06.500 --> 42:07.917
I'm trying to decide
what to do about it.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.917
Would you care
to make a suggestion?

42:10.000 --> 42:11.333
Um..

42:11.417 --> 42:14.500
Oh, uh, no, I'm sure
whatever Your Majesty decides

42:14.583 --> 42:16.125
will be appropriate.

42:16.208 --> 42:18.292
I should go and pack.

42:22.667 --> 42:26.542
No, I don't care at all
for the way he looks at me.

42:29.500 --> 42:31.458
Pluck out his eye.

42:32.875 --> 42:34.708
(male #1)
'Which one?'

42:34.792 --> 42:37.958
I don't know.
Doesn't matter.

42:41.417 --> 42:43.083
That one.

42:44.875 --> 42:47.875
[intense music]

43:02.958 --> 43:05.375
[theme music]
