WEBVTT

00:10.427 --> 00:12.929
Okay, that's two minutes.
Tell me when you feel the next push.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.432
-She's about to have baby!
-Get me out of here.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.434
<i>This is</i>
<i>the northbound 6 train.</i>

00:17.517 --> 00:18.977
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

00:20.603 --> 00:21.771
Was that another contraction?

00:21.855 --> 00:22.939
I don't know, Ruthie.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.358
Me neither. I don't know what I'm doing.
I'm looking at a watch.

00:25.442 --> 00:28.862
Oh, I can't do this.
You gotta get me outta here.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.822
We were so close to the hospital, Noraleh.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.950
Please, Ruthie,
you gotta get me back on that train.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.202
This is just fear. Push through.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.829
You are a survivor.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.164
Is anybody here a doctor?

00:39.247 --> 00:40.373
You are a doctor, no?

00:40.457 --> 00:43.084
No, I'm studying for my PhD
in clinical psychology.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.753
I can't deliver a baby.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.713
Not a fucking real doctor.

00:46.796 --> 00:47.922
Useless! Useless!

00:50.216 --> 00:52.802
Maybe I can deliver a baby
'cause it's just coming right now.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.388
-I handle.
-Look at me. I'm here with you.

00:55.472 --> 00:57.766
-What's the situation? Someone in trouble?

00:57.849 --> 00:58.975
Oh, hey, I know this lady.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.603
-Oh, this fucking guy. Okay.
-Can you help us or not?

01:01.686 --> 01:03.438
I'm prepared to get involved.
Here, take that.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.356
This baby is coming now.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.274
Yeah, no shit.

01:06.357 --> 01:07.942
Hey, hey, hey. You ever find that guy?

01:08.026 --> 01:10.820
Look, man, I don't wanna do this.
I did not sign up for this.

01:10.904 --> 01:13.656
Everything will be okay
when the baby comes.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.034
I am the baby.

01:16.117 --> 01:17.827
-I need you to push.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.996
Bear down with me. Now!

01:20.080 --> 01:21.664
Push, Nora. Use those sit-up muscles.

01:21.748 --> 01:23.500
-Sit-up muscles? Really?

01:23.583 --> 01:25.627
Okay, so rectus and transverse abdominals.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.003
Push, Nora! Push!

01:27.087 --> 01:28.338
-Push!
-Push!

01:28.421 --> 01:31.424
-Nora. Push.
-Push. Push.

01:32.675 --> 01:33.968
-Knife! Knife!
-I got you.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.012
Uh, can anybody spare a towel?

01:36.096 --> 01:38.723
-Can anybody spare a towel?
-A towel, please!

01:40.016 --> 01:40.850
Hello.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.118
There she is. Remember to hold the head.

01:58.701 --> 02:00.453
I-- I did.

02:00.537 --> 02:02.413
It's a real subway baby.

02:02.497 --> 02:05.291
Born on the 6 train platform.
Give this kid a key to the city.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.045
Nadia.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.131
Sweetheart.

02:11.631 --> 02:12.715
Hi, Nadia.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.134
Happy birthday, kiddo.

02:15.218 --> 02:18.429
Sweet birthday baby!

02:44.038 --> 02:45.373
Hey.

02:45.456 --> 02:47.417
Congratulations, baby.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.754
It's a girl.

02:52.463 --> 02:54.674
Huh? Mmm!

02:57.802 --> 02:59.596
Just what you wanted, huh, babe?

03:00.305 --> 03:01.347
Huh, babe?

03:01.431 --> 03:03.892
-Huh?

03:05.768 --> 03:07.020
What are you doing?

03:07.937 --> 03:10.023
I just came to say congrats.

03:10.732 --> 03:11.900
Heard it on the radio.

03:11.983 --> 03:13.484
-You're famous now.

03:13.568 --> 03:16.613
You know,
you should think about suing the MTA.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.031
Get some money out of this thing.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.074
I don't know. Sounds shady, Chez.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.409
Are you kidding me, babe?

03:21.910 --> 03:23.786
City's got real money.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.205
This could be big for us.

03:25.288 --> 03:26.414
They owe you.

03:26.998 --> 03:28.833
Well, I'm not sure that's exactly true.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.501
It is. They owe you.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.087
Are you fucking shameless?

03:33.171 --> 03:36.507
All right. Uh, okay.
I'll talk to you later.

03:37.217 --> 03:42.347
And, uh, yeah, hope they sew that up
nice and tight, you know? Zip.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.642
Yeah, well, they better.
I hope so too, because…

03:45.725 --> 03:46.976
Okay, get out. Get out.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.436
This shit-face man.

03:48.519 --> 03:52.106
Okay, lady, you got me wrong.
It's not even my kid, all right?

03:52.190 --> 03:53.858
She is a rock star,

03:54.442 --> 03:56.945
and I just came to say congratulations,

03:57.028 --> 04:00.365
or get well soon,
or whatever it is that you-- you say.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.283
How dare you come here?

04:02.367 --> 04:04.619
This kind of men you keep in your life,

04:04.702 --> 04:07.205
and you think you are ready
to up bring a child?

04:07.288 --> 04:08.498
This shit face?

04:08.581 --> 04:10.291
This bum? This thief?

04:10.375 --> 04:13.670
-A bug! A thief!
-What are you doing? Oh, what? You gonna--

04:15.922 --> 04:19.092
-Get out of here!
-Call me when you're, uh, zipped up.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.761
Nice and tight.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.854
Listen to me,
the baby comes home with us.

04:31.938 --> 04:34.190
We are making preparations
since she got pregnant.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.609
What? What do you mean? What about Nora?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.820
Nora cannot raise a child.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.114
We cannot control her.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.324
She needs to go back to asylum.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.327
Please don't call it that.
It's just another kind of hospital.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.414
Changing what I call it
does not change the thing itself.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.810
Please, Vera. For Nadia.
Give Nora a chance.

05:10.893 --> 05:11.936
You are not family.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.105
Give Nora a chance.
She should be allowed to try.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.691
This woman is not family.

05:18.735 --> 05:19.861
God, they're tough.

05:20.987 --> 05:21.863
I'll be back.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.574
Catch you on the flip side, Ruthie.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.595
I had it made before you lost the rest.

05:46.512 --> 05:51.225
Nora, you bring me trouble,
and now happiness.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.852
A baby.

05:53.436 --> 05:54.937
You may wear it now,

05:55.021 --> 05:58.316
but when Nadia is old enough,
this is for her.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.236
How are you feeling?

06:03.946 --> 06:05.073
Uh…

06:05.948 --> 06:06.783
Thirsty.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.327
I'll bring you soda.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.433
Ugh! Jesus.

06:43.694 --> 06:44.695
Showtime.

06:55.665 --> 06:57.166
Come on.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.339
The least you can do is help your family.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.384
If I could've just changed shit for Vera,
it would've changed shit for Nora.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.344
Ipso facto, better shit for us.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.346
I mean, trickle-down genomics.

07:10.430 --> 07:14.225
But no. Nothing you do makes a difference
'cause the whole game is rigged, right?

07:14.308 --> 07:18.521
So I'm just gonna go ahead
and beat time at its own game.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.774
And we're finally gonna get
the mother we should've had.

07:21.858 --> 07:22.692
Me.

07:23.192 --> 07:24.235
Cool.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.153
All right.

07:25.945 --> 07:27.238
Fuck that guy. Come on.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.991
Come on. Come on.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.536
Come on.
This is real<i> Thelma & Thelma,</i> huh?

07:34.537 --> 07:36.372
Swear to God,
this fucking re-parenting shit

07:36.456 --> 07:37.915
is gonna give me an aneurysm.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.418
That means you're gonna get
a baby aneurysm.

07:40.501 --> 07:41.419
-This is good.

07:41.502 --> 07:44.422
I know what you're thinking,
"another big crazy idea."

07:44.505 --> 07:47.008
-Oh, you think it's a bad idea? All right.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.426
Well, hey.

07:48.509 --> 07:51.471
High risk, high reward,
right, little kiddo?

07:52.138 --> 07:53.306
My little baby.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.059
Yeah, you're a fucking winner, kid.

07:57.643 --> 07:58.561
Come on.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.565
<i>This is</i>
<i>the northbound 6 train.</i>

08:02.648 --> 08:04.609
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors.</i>

08:23.669 --> 08:24.670
Papers, please?

08:29.175 --> 08:30.384
That's, um,

08:30.468 --> 08:31.719
that's all I have.

08:38.142 --> 08:39.685
What is your destination?

08:39.769 --> 08:42.939
Um, West Berlin, I think.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.690
Station?

08:45.274 --> 08:46.734
Potsdam Platz.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.570
You're not authorized.

08:50.780 --> 08:51.906
A ghost station.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.658
What-- what are you doing?

08:53.741 --> 08:54.742
You'll be contacted.

08:55.618 --> 08:56.869
You're a student?

08:56.953 --> 08:58.079
Country of origin?

08:58.162 --> 09:00.373
What? No, no, no,
you don't need to write that down.

09:00.456 --> 09:03.751
I'm-- I'm just--
I'm looking for a friend. I--

09:03.834 --> 09:06.087
I wanna make sure he's all right.
I-- I won't stay long.

09:06.170 --> 09:10.841
His sister lives in, uh, Prinzenstraße.
That's all I remember, but, um…

09:11.551 --> 09:16.180
I'm not sure I remember that correctly,
I-- I think. I'm-- I'm sorry, I'm lost.

09:16.931 --> 09:20.268
The only train you should be taking
is a train home, fräulein.

09:58.347 --> 10:03.019
You want a little 666 tattoo
on your little baby forehead?

10:03.102 --> 10:04.687
Little pentagram baby?

10:04.770 --> 10:06.439
Talkie-talkie-talkie.

10:06.522 --> 10:08.399
Oh! What a cute baby.

10:08.983 --> 10:12.320
Happy to remain a missed connection, okay?

10:14.196 --> 10:17.325
-There you go. Eat those little hairs up.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.832
-Oh shit.

10:24.915 --> 10:25.875
Oh shit.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.378
-<i>Hello? Nemo?</i>
-Yo, Maxine, can you hear me?

10:29.462 --> 10:32.340
Oh my God, it's her. Jesus, why haven't
you been picking up your phone?

10:32.423 --> 10:35.384
What? I'm on the train.
Can you-- can you hear me?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.596
Listen, Ruth has a pulmonary embolism.
She's in the hospital, okay?

10:38.679 --> 10:39.555
Wait, what?

10:39.639 --> 10:42.141
Pulmonary embolism. Is that what it is?

10:42.224 --> 10:44.769
-It's a blood clot.
-Yeah, a blood clot in her lung.

10:44.852 --> 10:47.897
Nadia, listen, listen.
They don't know if she's gonna make it.

10:50.608 --> 10:51.734
<i>Hello?</i>

10:51.817 --> 10:53.861
Yeah, look, I'm on the 6 train, and, uh--

10:53.944 --> 10:55.946
-<i> Is that a baby?</i>
-I'm on my way there.

10:56.030 --> 10:57.239
-<i>Hello--</i>

10:57.323 --> 11:01.243
<i>This is northbound 6 train.</i>
<i>Next stop, 77th Street, Lenox Hill.</i>

11:26.894 --> 11:28.229
There she is.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.313
Where's Ruth?

11:29.397 --> 11:30.648
Nadia, it doesn't look so good.

11:30.731 --> 11:33.609
What's the over-under
on Nadia showing up at all?

11:34.568 --> 11:37.780
I know, it's 2022.
No one turns their phones off anymore.

11:37.863 --> 11:41.325
-I know. You have to charge it.
-Wait, Max? Lizzy?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.952
Oh good. Nadia, you're here.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.120
You owe me a light box.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.038
Hey. Uh, what the hell is happening?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.581
Someone trusted you with a baby?

11:47.665 --> 11:50.584
Okay, well, Ruth's fine.
She's just changing.

11:50.668 --> 11:52.294
-Ruth's fine?
-Yeah.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.546
It's just a fender bender.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.298
That was almost two weeks ago.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.591
Can I hold her?

11:57.675 --> 11:59.885
Yeah. Yeah, smart.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.887
Uh, she doesn't need to see this shit.

12:01.971 --> 12:04.432
-Newborns are blind.
-No, actually newborn puppies are blind.

12:04.515 --> 12:05.641
And love, love is blind.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.394
All right, now listen to me.
These are the two safest women I know.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.479
And granted, that's not saying much,

12:10.563 --> 12:13.733
but as Rummy says,
we go to war with the army we have.

12:13.816 --> 12:17.820
So just stay here, and I'll be back.
You're okay, all right? You're safe.

12:17.903 --> 12:18.779
All right.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.533
Hey. How's it going? Me again.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.702
Uh, I'm looking
for a patient, Ruth Brenner.

12:24.785 --> 12:25.745
You family?

12:25.828 --> 12:26.996
Yes.

12:27.079 --> 12:29.498
Maybe it's a drug baby. Check its diaper.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.794
-Exam room three.
-Terrific.

12:39.633 --> 12:40.593
Ah.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.928
Oh good, you're finally here.

12:43.012 --> 12:43.846
Yeah.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.390
I couldn't reach you so I called Maxine.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.393
But listen,
we've got to stop at the pharmacy.

12:49.477 --> 12:51.562
I have to pick up my Valium.

12:51.645 --> 12:54.106
You-- you already got your Valium, Ruthie.

12:54.190 --> 12:56.650
So either you're trying to become
some kind of a benzo Scarface,

12:56.734 --> 12:58.527
or I'm missing something here.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.696
Maxine said you were dying.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.781
No.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.867
Maxine is such a drama queen.

13:04.950 --> 13:07.369
It was just a fender bender.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.871
What day do you think it is?

13:08.954 --> 13:10.206
Oh, I know.

13:10.289 --> 13:13.501
You're trying to remind me
of your birthday.

13:13.584 --> 13:16.837
I have an entire week to plan your gift,

13:16.921 --> 13:20.049
so just don't rush an old lady.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.593
Okay. Okay, Ruthie.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.180
Ah.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.976
Hi, uh, I'm looking for a patient,
uh, Ruth Brenner.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.437
She came back in, probably today,
in an ambulance maybe.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.397
Something wrong with her lungs.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.774
-Brenner, you said?
-Yeah.

13:37.274 --> 13:38.400
Exam bay seven.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.277
Seven? Seven.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.113
Fucking time bomb.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.244
Nadia, I thought you'd gone.
Now, listen.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.956
They wanna keep me overnight.
Yeah, they always wanna run more tests.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.250
Nothing too thrilling.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.670
But, oh, what they're billing me
for that room…

13:57.753 --> 14:00.756
…I'm expecting
five-star treatment.

14:35.457 --> 14:36.292
Ruthie.

14:37.918 --> 14:38.878
Are you okay?

14:40.004 --> 14:44.383
I am the hot new thing around here.

14:46.427 --> 14:50.472
Everybody wants to take pictures
of my insides.

15:06.780 --> 15:08.866
Now, listen, I know.

15:08.949 --> 15:11.702
I know I'm a few days early,

15:11.785 --> 15:13.037
but…

15:13.120 --> 15:15.539
…happy birthday, baby.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.874
Mwah!

15:17.666 --> 15:21.378
My birthday is today, Ruthie.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.798
She's a good eater.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.685
-Hold on. I'm busy.
-Look at her stretching. Aw!

15:36.769 --> 15:39.438
Wow, Lizzy,
you're really good with babies.

15:39.521 --> 15:41.398
I take Louis to the park on Sundays.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.609
-Nemo.
-Code blue!

15:43.692 --> 15:45.277
-Nadia!
-I need two epis!

15:45.361 --> 15:47.404
-Ruth! Ruth! No, wait!

15:47.488 --> 15:49.782
Let's push. Two liters,
normal saline, wide open.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.450
Ma'am, you can't be here.

15:51.533 --> 15:52.826
I can't get a pulse.

15:52.910 --> 15:53.911
How we doing?

15:53.994 --> 15:56.163
-Keep it going.
-Give me the paddles now!

15:56.246 --> 15:58.165
-Okay. Ruth.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.962
Ma'am, are you okay?

16:03.045 --> 16:04.546
-Where is she? She was just here.
-Who?

16:04.630 --> 16:05.798
Ruth Brenner.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.883
I'm sorry. I don't have
a Ruth Brenner on my chart.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.176
I need you to calm down.

16:09.259 --> 16:10.844
Hey, what day is it for you?

16:10.928 --> 16:13.806
-March 22nd.
-No, you see, it's March 30th.

16:13.889 --> 16:17.017
I'm telling you as a medical professional,
it's March 22nd.

16:17.101 --> 16:21.981
Okay, listen to me,
there are Ruths all over this hospital,

16:22.064 --> 16:24.984
and I just need to find the right Ruth.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.529
Okay, ma'am, have a seat.
You are having a panic attack.

16:28.612 --> 16:30.656
Deep breaths. I'm gonna get you a doctor.

16:38.372 --> 16:41.458
Thirty-six and gets hit by a taxi.
What a waste.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.961
-They're bums.
-They don't look when they cross.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.087
Fucking addicted.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.798
It's the blue light.
It goes right into their fucking brains.

16:47.881 --> 16:49.717
-Exactly.
-They're looking down.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.760
-It's like fucking porn.
-Yup.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.596
Dude, I haven't watched porn
in like a week. It's been a week.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.141
-Easy. Easy!
-Watch it. Watch it!

16:59.643 --> 17:01.562
Come on. That's not…

17:02.396 --> 17:03.981
You didn't text my sister.

17:04.064 --> 17:06.400
-Yeah, I'll text her back. Relax.
-She's hot.

17:06.483 --> 17:10.654
-I know. I'll text her back.
-She's hot, she's smart, funny…

17:13.615 --> 17:16.702
-She just likes you.
-More than like.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.704
-Oh, hey.
-Oh, necrophiliac.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.540
Heading in there and fuck some bodies.
Good luck.

17:21.623 --> 17:22.708
Hey, the zombies.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.210
-Go easy on 'em.
-Coroner, yeah.

17:26.545 --> 17:29.548
-I guess she likes 'em stiff.

17:29.631 --> 17:31.550
Stiff as a pig. Let's get a drink.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.841
Spooky action at a distance.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.059
-Fuck you say about my mother?
-What?

19:04.143 --> 19:06.478
No, what the fuck did you say
about my mother?

19:06.562 --> 19:08.939
Come down the stairs,
let me hear you say it to my face.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.983
Nah, come here,
let me hear you say what you said.

19:11.066 --> 19:12.776
<i>Stand clear</i>
<i>of the closing doors.</i>

19:12.860 --> 19:14.361
You ain't so tough right now, huh?

19:14.444 --> 19:17.197
I saw you drop that trash back there.
This ain't your house.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.657
You don't litter in here.

19:18.740 --> 19:19.658
Fucking animals.

19:19.741 --> 19:22.035
-No, no, no.
-You know what? Hold my shit.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.371
-Fuck, I'm--
-Get the fuck out of his way.

19:24.454 --> 19:26.206
-Fuck.
-Come and talk that shit again.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.457
Take your ass back to the zoo.

19:28.500 --> 19:31.420
-<i>We're sorry. You have-</i>-
-Motherfucking fuck, come on.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.546
-Alan.

19:32.629 --> 19:34.381
-Fuck.
<i>We're sorry.</i>

19:34.464 --> 19:37.843
<i>-You have reached a number that has been--</i>
-Dude. Fucking pick up your phone, man.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.303
<i> Listen, young man.</i>

19:39.386 --> 19:41.680
I'm sorry, ma'am.
I'm looking for my friend Nadia.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.433
<i> I've been at this address</i>
<i>longer than you've been alive…</i>

19:44.516 --> 19:47.311
Yeah. Uh, I understand
you've had this number--

19:49.688 --> 19:52.733
Yes, ma'am, I agree that Mayor Dinkins
is ruining this city.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.110
-<i> It's never been--</i>

19:58.197 --> 20:00.616
Mateo, I told you,
it's supposed to be imperfect.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.950
I need more bubbles.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.619
Yes, I am listening.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.079
I got you some stuff.
I know you're just babysitting.

20:06.163 --> 20:09.291
-Oh, she's been a perfect angel.

20:09.374 --> 20:10.918
-Okay.
-Where you going?

20:11.001 --> 20:13.962
Nothing I say is gonna make a difference,
'cause time is collapsing.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.465
You're stuck in your moment.
I'm stuck in mine.

20:16.548 --> 20:17.799
Nadia, you sound so sad.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.093
I just need to get to
my emergency contact.

20:21.553 --> 20:23.180
Nadia? Uh…

20:25.432 --> 20:26.308
Nadia.

20:32.105 --> 20:32.940
Nadia?

20:33.690 --> 20:34.608
Oh.

20:36.151 --> 20:37.110
Oatmeal?

20:38.987 --> 20:41.406
Ooh…

20:41.490 --> 20:42.699
No, no, no, no, no.

20:43.492 --> 20:45.202
No, no, no, no, no. Why?

20:45.786 --> 20:47.579
What did you do, Nadia?

20:47.663 --> 20:49.289
Oh, something's not right.

20:50.624 --> 20:52.251
Something is not right, no.

20:56.171 --> 20:58.048
Oh, don't worry. I'm not a thief.

20:58.131 --> 20:59.549
-You're Alan's friend?
-Yeah.

20:59.633 --> 21:02.219
He asked me to feed Boba Fett,
but I either overfed or underfed him.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.846
The fish flakes are so small,
but the fish is also small.

21:04.930 --> 21:06.306
Can you tell him I'm sorry?

21:09.893 --> 21:11.228
I just killed Alan's fish.

21:11.311 --> 21:13.981
Fucking LSD parade. Jesus.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.442
Hey. Hey, Ferran, have you seen Nadia?

21:17.526 --> 21:20.362
Hey, man. Holy shit, this is awesome.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.281
Dad, this is my best friend, Alan.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.449
What? Your dad died three years ago.

21:24.533 --> 21:27.077
Don't be crazy. He's standing right here.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.914
Hey, check it out. Guess what I found
in a trash can in Seward Park.

21:30.998 --> 21:32.874
-Hey, Oatmeal, meet Alan.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.544
-Hey, Oatmeal, meet Alan.

21:36.295 --> 21:38.005
-Hey, Oatmeal, meet Alan.

21:40.090 --> 21:41.300
That's--

21:41.383 --> 21:42.926
Nice to meet you, Oatmeal.

21:49.725 --> 21:51.560
Looks pretty alive to me.

21:52.436 --> 21:53.645
It's okay. Come on.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.441
Alan, are you here, man?

21:57.524 --> 21:58.734
<i> Repeat after me…</i>

21:58.817 --> 22:00.610
-Fuck. Ah!

22:00.694 --> 22:02.779
<i>He has wonderful eyes.</i>
<i>-Nein, </i>Alexa!

22:03.947 --> 22:07.576
<i> Now playing</i>
<i>Beethoven's</i> <i>Piano Concerto No. 4.</i>

22:16.543 --> 22:17.711
I know. I know.

22:18.503 --> 22:19.796
Stephen Hawking.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.298
Basic.

22:31.933 --> 22:35.771
Everything's gonna be all right.
Come on. You can't keep doing this.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.190
Come on. We'll go to Odessa.
Get you some food.

22:38.273 --> 22:40.150
All right? Everything's gonna be good.

22:40.233 --> 22:42.319
We'll get you some mozzarella sticks.
You love them.

22:42.402 --> 22:45.489
-Is that what you want?
-No. No.

22:45.572 --> 22:47.949
No housing,
no peace, no yuppies!

22:48.033 --> 22:49.493
No housing, no peace, yuppie.

22:49.576 --> 22:52.788
-No housing, no peace, no yuppies!
-Fuck.

23:54.683 --> 23:55.517
Hi.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.935
Hi.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.104
Hi.
