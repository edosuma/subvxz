WEBVTT

00:17.612 --> 00:19.182
- Nobody's reported them
missing.

00:19.248 --> 00:20.752
Nobody's called
in a disturbance.

00:20.819 --> 00:23.190
These houses are an acre apart.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.726
Brenda's neighbors
were 10 feet away

00:24.793 --> 00:27.499
and all they heard over the
Orioles was pounding on a wall.

00:27.566 --> 00:28.534
- Right.

00:30.539 --> 00:32.742
There it is. Bishop Low's.

00:35.447 --> 00:36.750
Porch light's off.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.125
I'll be at the front door.

01:01.600 --> 01:03.972
Police!

01:05.374 --> 01:06.777
Bill.

01:39.777 --> 01:41.278
Police!

02:34.485 --> 02:37.792
Hey!

02:41.767 --> 02:43.036
- Charming.

02:43.103 --> 02:44.238
- Sorry.

03:11.660 --> 03:13.130
It's all clear.

03:15.167 --> 03:18.340
Judging by the jewelry
I saw dumped in the toilet,

03:18.406 --> 03:19.576
wouldn't peg this a robbery.

03:19.643 --> 03:22.047
- No. Checkbook's right there.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.249
Kidnapping?

03:23.316 --> 03:24.519
- God, I hope that
they got outta here

03:24.586 --> 03:26.523
before anything like
that could happen,

03:26.590 --> 03:28.794
and somewhere
we can find them first.

03:39.348 --> 03:41.018
Okay. Thanks, Fred.

03:41.085 --> 03:44.158
Well, at least half
of Sam's list is still alive.

03:44.224 --> 03:46.262
Our boys just found
the Laffertys' stake president,

03:46.329 --> 03:48.266
Mr. Stowe,
and his wife asleep in bed.

03:49.569 --> 03:51.339
Say they haven't seen
anything unusual.

03:51.405 --> 03:54.011
No bearded men.

03:54.077 --> 03:56.917
But also said they haven't
heard from the Lows for a week.

03:58.821 --> 03:59.656
Which is unusual.

03:59.722 --> 04:01.526
- L--hey, Morris.
- Sir.

04:01.593 --> 04:03.329
- First light, I need you to...

04:03.396 --> 04:04.700
Track the last knowns
of the Lows.

04:04.767 --> 04:06.102
- Yes, sir.
Where would you--

04:06.169 --> 04:07.237
where would you like me
to look?

04:09.308 --> 04:10.210
- Talk to neighbors.

04:10.277 --> 04:12.916
- Neighbors.

04:12.983 --> 04:14.451
- The Lows' kids.

04:14.519 --> 04:16.857
Kids.
- Um...

04:16.924 --> 04:20.163
You know, phone records
and credit cards,

04:20.230 --> 04:22.434
that kind of thing.

04:22.502 --> 04:25.406
Careful. Go.

04:29.649 --> 04:31.686
You and me, we need
to keep pushing Robin.

04:31.753 --> 04:33.891
If he had these names
up his sleeve...

04:33.957 --> 04:35.795
- That's fine with me.

04:35.862 --> 04:37.131
Yeah.

04:40.839 --> 04:43.209
Sorry, it's a letter
from Dianna asking for help

04:43.276 --> 04:45.114
with, uh,
the Lafferty brothers'

04:45.180 --> 04:47.518
questionable behavior.

04:47.585 --> 04:48.688
- To the president
of your church?

04:48.755 --> 04:50.157
To the living Prophet.

04:50.224 --> 04:52.094
It's kind of like
writing a letter

04:52.160 --> 04:55.000
to Heavenly Father himself.

04:55.067 --> 04:56.736
And it's--it's hard to imagine

04:56.803 --> 05:01.078
an LDS wife doing this
to her own family.

05:03.216 --> 05:05.053
It's extreme.

05:05.119 --> 05:06.155
And this could have--

05:14.506 --> 05:18.413
Oh, gosh.
Bill, we have to find her.

05:20.952 --> 05:23.056
Whoa, you guys are pros.

05:23.122 --> 05:25.528
- They look great.
- Yeah.

05:25.594 --> 05:28.333
- Hey, Jeb, I called, um,
Nana and Papa

05:28.400 --> 05:29.836
and, uh, told them to hold off

05:29.903 --> 05:31.472
on coming
for the girls' baptisms.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.578
They're a little anxious
to know when we, um,

05:33.644 --> 05:35.347
might be moving the date to.

05:35.414 --> 05:37.417
- Girls do not need baptizing.

05:37.484 --> 05:39.488
I mean, look at them,
clean as whistles.

05:41.493 --> 05:44.064
That's a bath, not a baptism.
- Bath, bath.

05:44.131 --> 05:45.568
You're thinking of a bath.

05:45.635 --> 05:47.471
- You know who should give
a God damn about baptism?

05:47.539 --> 05:49.041
Hey, Mom. That's a no-no.

05:52.982 --> 05:54.352
Annie drew the rainbow.

05:55.621 --> 05:56.790
You guys did this?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.896
It's great.
- See this? Beautiful.

05:59.963 --> 06:01.265
Murder of the
young mother and daughter,

06:01.332 --> 06:04.237
detectives are investigating
ties to Satanists

06:04.304 --> 06:05.574
and other fringe sects known

06:05.641 --> 06:07.044
to practice
ritualized killing.

06:10.450 --> 06:12.487
- Skates off
and shoes on in 20.

06:13.991 --> 06:14.793
Honey--

06:14.860 --> 06:15.995
Hmm?
- Is that true?

06:16.061 --> 06:17.565
The Jews, they need baptisms.

06:17.632 --> 06:18.701
Hello? Are you still there?

06:18.768 --> 06:21.005
Yes, uh,
this is Detective Pyre.

06:21.071 --> 06:22.274
So sorry, Brother Pyre,

06:22.341 --> 06:24.579
I hope your hair hasn't
gone gray from waiting.

06:24.646 --> 06:26.148
- No, it's fine.

06:26.215 --> 06:27.852
I got ahold
of the original letter

06:27.919 --> 06:29.790
that Sister Lafferty
mailed to the Prophet.

06:29.856 --> 06:31.125
- Mm-hmm.

06:31.192 --> 06:32.728
I see here
he directed the matter

06:32.795 --> 06:36.469
to Bishop Low and to a member
of the bishopric,

06:36.536 --> 06:38.273
LeConte Bascom.

06:38.340 --> 06:39.474
- Can you--

06:39.542 --> 06:42.414
B-A-S-C-O-M.

06:44.051 --> 06:45.588
- Wonderful--you've been
a great help, Brother.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.592
Thank you so much.

06:47.658 --> 06:48.927
You call back any time.

06:48.994 --> 06:52.100
The Prophet's praying
for your investigation.

06:52.167 --> 06:53.135
- He is?

06:57.343 --> 06:58.614
That's all we're gonna need.

06:58.681 --> 07:00.083
I appreciate that
very much, Brother.

07:00.150 --> 07:02.053
Thanks. Bye.

07:04.358 --> 07:05.394
Everything okay?

07:05.460 --> 07:07.566
Yeah.
Everything's great, Mom.

07:07.632 --> 07:09.235
That radio reporter knows

07:09.302 --> 07:11.507
as much about this case

07:11.573 --> 07:15.581
as our toaster, okay?

07:15.648 --> 07:17.384
Should we unplug
our toaster too?

07:18.988 --> 07:22.394
You know, if the Jews
don't accept Christ,

07:22.460 --> 07:25.066
they--they're gonna
find themselves

07:25.133 --> 07:28.540
in the Telestial Kingdom
with Hitler.

07:28.607 --> 07:31.279
- Josie, that kind of talk
scares the girls.

07:31.345 --> 07:32.649
Remember we talked about that?
- Mom, Mom--

07:32.715 --> 07:33.917
Don't speak back to me,

07:33.984 --> 07:35.821
because I don't speak
like that with the girls.

07:35.888 --> 07:37.424
- You want to go for a walk?
Yes.

07:37.492 --> 07:38.794
Yeah?

07:38.861 --> 07:39.796
- Yes.
- Let's go for a walk.

07:39.863 --> 07:41.231
I'm sorry.

07:41.298 --> 07:42.735
She's sorry, Beccs.

07:42.802 --> 07:44.171
Sorry.

07:44.238 --> 07:45.742
- I'm gonna meet you
in the hallway, all right?

07:45.808 --> 07:47.144
- Okay.
- Be right back.

07:47.210 --> 07:48.379
- Okay.
- All right.

07:48.446 --> 07:49.615
- Okay.

07:51.887 --> 07:53.122
- I know she doesn't mean it.

07:53.189 --> 07:57.164
It's just the things she says
around the girls,

07:57.231 --> 07:59.903
and I--

07:59.969 --> 08:02.975
I can't calm her down
like you can.

08:03.042 --> 08:05.314
And you're not always here,
and so...

08:08.920 --> 08:13.429
Can we--can we please
try the medications?

08:20.912 --> 08:24.017
- Call her doctor and ask
about side effects, okay?

08:28.861 --> 08:30.898
- Brother Pyre.
- Good morning.

08:32.868 --> 08:34.204
Uh, LeConte Bascom.
- Brother Bascom.

08:34.271 --> 08:35.741
Ignore the creases in my tie.

08:35.808 --> 08:37.310
Had to shake a leg
to meet you before we opened.

08:37.377 --> 08:39.147
- Oh, I appreciate the haste,
Brother, thank you.

08:39.214 --> 08:40.584
- Oh, it's nothing.

08:40.651 --> 08:43.991
The, uh, Prophet's office urged
me to help you any way I can.

08:44.057 --> 08:45.894
Take one. They're cinnamon.
Oh, gosh.

08:45.961 --> 08:47.832
I can't keep
disappointing my dentist.

08:47.899 --> 08:49.969
I can't do it.
Thank you, though.

08:50.036 --> 08:51.506
But I was hoping
you could shed some light--

08:51.573 --> 08:53.042
- Yes, yes,
about Dianna's letter.

08:53.109 --> 08:55.179
The Prophet's office
filled me in.

08:56.650 --> 08:59.488
- Oh, good. Good.

08:59.555 --> 09:01.560
Okay.

09:01.627 --> 09:03.229
So let's start
with what you did

09:03.295 --> 09:05.166
when you first received
the letter.

09:05.233 --> 09:07.470
Well, I had a word with Ron

09:07.538 --> 09:09.742
when he came in looking
to get approved on a loan.

09:09.809 --> 09:11.713
Duplex sales
are in the dang gutter

09:11.779 --> 09:14.318
because interest rates
are what they are, and--

09:14.384 --> 09:17.390
and you are overleveraged.
I just wish it were less risky.

09:17.457 --> 09:18.694
- "Risky"?

09:18.761 --> 09:20.229
You've never used that word
with me before.

09:20.296 --> 09:22.601
This is lean, it is a four-plex
with a heavily-vetted client.

09:22.668 --> 09:24.573
You know my word is oak.
You know that.

09:24.639 --> 09:25.842
- If it were up to me alone,

09:25.908 --> 09:29.114
I'd give you
the dang bank vault, Brother.

09:29.181 --> 09:31.018
- Who else is it up to?
Maybe I should speak to them.

09:31.085 --> 09:33.657
Ron, it's my file. I'm sorry.

09:35.092 --> 09:38.032
- Brother Bascom,
I don't get this loan,

09:38.099 --> 09:40.370
then I can't afford
to keep operating.

09:40.436 --> 09:42.441
And I'm gonna lose my business
and I'm gonna lose my home.

09:42.508 --> 09:45.915
What, my wife is next?

09:45.981 --> 09:49.121
Do you want me
to lose my children, hmm?

09:49.188 --> 09:50.156
- Ron...

09:52.762 --> 09:54.297
The church has received
a letter

09:54.364 --> 09:57.738
asking for intervention in your
brothers' anti-tax organizing.

09:59.676 --> 10:02.682
The church passed it on to me.

10:02.748 --> 10:05.487
- So you won't sell me
because Dan refuses

10:05.554 --> 10:06.957
to pay sales tax in a store?

10:07.024 --> 10:08.594
It's because
of his failure to pay tax

10:08.660 --> 10:10.330
on your father's home

10:10.396 --> 10:13.904
as part of a scheme to
challenge taxation as a whole.

10:13.970 --> 10:15.608
Filing a lawsuit to say
the 16th Amendment

10:15.674 --> 10:17.645
hasn't been ratified?

10:17.712 --> 10:18.914
That's kicking up dust.

10:18.980 --> 10:21.620
- Okay, and what's he got
to do with me?

10:21.687 --> 10:25.026
- Ron, your wife
wrote the letter.

10:25.093 --> 10:27.431
She seems pretty worried
about it.

10:31.472 --> 10:34.713
Now don't you lay the blame
at her feet, all right?

10:34.779 --> 10:36.983
Those ERA types
spawn more varieties

10:37.050 --> 10:38.720
of bad influence
than we can stamp out.

10:38.787 --> 10:40.356
You know, Phil Donahue's

10:40.423 --> 10:42.361
positively urging our wives
to run wild.

10:42.427 --> 10:45.399
I'm sure it was
only out of concern

10:45.466 --> 10:47.672
for the man that she loves--
that's you--

10:47.738 --> 10:50.110
but anti-government schemes

10:50.176 --> 10:52.848
leaves me in no position
to walk out on a limb with you.

10:52.915 --> 10:54.418
- Look at my hands.
I'm a builder.

10:54.485 --> 10:56.288
What use would I have
for anti-government schemes?

10:56.355 --> 10:57.691
I don't make it my business

10:57.758 --> 10:58.961
to understand
that sort of thing,

10:59.028 --> 11:00.564
but your brother's been
very outspoken

11:00.631 --> 11:02.902
about his new
political hobbies,

11:02.968 --> 11:05.072
and, well, he--

11:05.139 --> 11:09.414
he portrays it
as a family affair, Ron.

11:09.481 --> 11:12.153
Thank you for your time.

11:12.220 --> 11:15.059
Was Ron angry with Dianna?

11:15.126 --> 11:17.264
- Oh, heck. No, no, no.

11:17.330 --> 11:19.669
No, it was Dan that was making
a mess of their name,

11:19.736 --> 11:22.107
not his sweet wife.

11:22.174 --> 11:25.346
No, Dan was threatening
the reputation of the church,

11:25.413 --> 11:28.385
and as a result,
Ron's own livelihood.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.660
- So Ron was only
angry with Dan?

11:31.727 --> 11:32.695
Wouldn't you be?

11:32.761 --> 11:34.131
It'd take hours to drive you

11:34.198 --> 11:36.770
around all the homes that
Ron has put up around here.

11:36.836 --> 11:39.475
Dan...

11:39.542 --> 11:41.245
Dan's a wrecking ball.

11:56.008 --> 11:59.916
Brenda just couldn't
let a thing alone.

11:59.982 --> 12:01.653
- You think Brenda
helped write that?

12:01.720 --> 12:03.055
If Dianna wrote this letter,

12:03.122 --> 12:05.761
then you can be sure that
Brenda put the pen in her hand.

12:07.264 --> 12:08.601
Did Dan know about this letter?

12:08.667 --> 12:11.105
He wouldn't have paid it
much mind if he did.

12:11.171 --> 12:14.745
He knows more than any
of the wives about her faith.

12:14.812 --> 12:16.382
And at the time that
this letter was written,

12:16.449 --> 12:21.760
his message was bigger
than the 4th of July.

12:29.742 --> 12:31.980
Don't let the government
steal any more money

12:32.047 --> 12:33.517
out of your pockets.

12:33.583 --> 12:35.353
You keep what's yours.

12:37.423 --> 12:41.332
Where'd the founding fathers
say you needed

12:41.399 --> 12:43.937
a Social Security number
to be an American?

12:46.776 --> 12:50.183
They tag us like cattle,
track us down,

12:50.249 --> 12:53.122
and then claim half
of what's ours is theirs.

12:53.189 --> 12:57.197
No! They don't own me,
and they don't own you, either.

12:57.264 --> 13:00.571
So vote Lafferty

13:00.638 --> 13:02.842
and live free under the true,

13:02.908 --> 13:06.114
original laws
of the U.S. Constitution.

13:10.657 --> 13:11.926
I suppose
enough people tell you

13:11.993 --> 13:14.097
you're the Kennedys of Utah,

13:14.164 --> 13:17.972
you think it's your destiny
to be in charge.

13:18.039 --> 13:21.847
- You ever heard of
Governor Boggs from Missouri?

13:21.913 --> 13:23.584
He was shot in the head
one night...

13:24.686 --> 13:26.355
Then he pinned

13:26.422 --> 13:30.831
the assassination attempt
on us.

13:30.897 --> 13:32.768
So what did our Prophet do?

13:32.835 --> 13:35.139
He launched
a presidential campaign.

13:35.206 --> 13:36.375
- Well, correct me
if I'm wrong,

13:36.442 --> 13:38.814
but Joe Smith
didn't become president.

13:38.881 --> 13:40.817
- He could have.
He was very popular.

13:40.884 --> 13:42.320
- Like your brother Dan?

13:44.324 --> 13:47.030
- My brother Dan
has always been very popular.

13:47.097 --> 13:48.733
And the only person

13:48.800 --> 13:53.075
who had a problem with Dan
running was our father.

13:53.142 --> 13:54.512
Yeah, she's a gypsy. Huh?

13:54.579 --> 13:55.948
Whoa.

13:56.014 --> 13:57.885
Yeah, she's got me
under her spell.

13:57.952 --> 13:59.421
Whoa, wait. Hold on.

13:59.488 --> 14:00.924
What--what are you
making me do?

14:00.991 --> 14:03.295
Oh, she's making--
what is she making me do?

14:03.362 --> 14:05.400
I'ma--oh--mm.

14:05.467 --> 14:07.905
Oh, no!
She's got me under her spell.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.577
Lord, she's bending me
to her will!

14:10.644 --> 14:12.982
- Dan. All right.

14:13.049 --> 14:14.952
Hey. Hey, Dan.
- Conspirer!

14:19.227 --> 14:23.469
Get hence, serpent. Get!

14:23.537 --> 14:25.508
Get!

14:25.574 --> 14:27.811
Get! Get! All of you!

14:27.878 --> 14:29.347
Go! Get!

14:33.089 --> 14:36.763
Are you wiser
than the Word of Wisdom?

14:36.830 --> 14:41.304
Ungrateful to a wife who
stooped to marry a deadbeat?

14:42.975 --> 14:44.344
I intend to tell Matilda
about this,

14:44.411 --> 14:46.516
and we know
she does not fear divorce.

14:49.187 --> 14:52.226
- The Lord guides
my political vision.

14:52.293 --> 14:54.498
- Wrong!

14:54.565 --> 14:57.671
The voice you hear
is the devil's.

14:57.738 --> 15:02.013
Oh, he--he answers prayers too.

15:05.119 --> 15:08.158
In your cheering crowds,

15:08.225 --> 15:11.933
do you judge what is holy
on what is fashionable?

15:14.772 --> 15:16.108
Yeah. Oh, no.

15:16.175 --> 15:17.945
Your mother and I, we...

15:20.316 --> 15:22.521
We cannot return
to our mission.

15:22.588 --> 15:25.426
All those souls in Louisiana
in need of baptism,

15:25.494 --> 15:29.134
and we must stay here
to save our--our son now.

15:32.741 --> 15:36.983
Flee from temptation, Daniel.
Look away from man's laws.

15:37.050 --> 15:39.989
They're so...

15:40.056 --> 15:43.630
small and temporary.

15:49.074 --> 15:53.650
Lean back toward
Heavenly Father's designs.

15:53.717 --> 15:56.756
Study them closely.

15:57.858 --> 16:00.196
His Word.

16:00.262 --> 16:02.668
Understanding His laws...

16:05.907 --> 16:08.378
Is bliss.

16:13.188 --> 16:15.226
Be my good boy again.

16:20.904 --> 16:22.608
Pray with us.

16:27.316 --> 16:28.720
Our Father in heaven.

16:32.461 --> 16:36.068
May I find the strength...

16:36.135 --> 16:37.604
Guide me...

16:37.671 --> 16:39.708
How deep into study
did Dan go?

16:41.412 --> 16:44.217
Dan just took
our father's words to heart.

16:46.722 --> 16:50.062
Started spending his days
in the BYU library,

16:50.129 --> 16:53.704
researching the early prophets,
and...

16:53.770 --> 16:55.708
he grew frustrated
with the fact that

16:55.774 --> 16:58.078
so much of our history

16:58.145 --> 17:01.117
seemed to have been
purposefully removed

17:01.184 --> 17:05.359
from every library in Utah,
including BYU's.

17:05.426 --> 17:08.600
So Dan started
seeking out saints

17:08.666 --> 17:13.108
who were living
by our original texts.

17:13.175 --> 17:16.081
And then that gave Dan
an excuse

17:16.148 --> 17:18.753
to drive us down
to Colorado City.

17:18.820 --> 17:20.422
We're not supposed
to have anything to do

17:20.489 --> 17:23.563
with these people, Dan.
Turn the truck around.

17:23.630 --> 17:24.665
Dan!

17:24.732 --> 17:27.136
- They study our scriptures,
don't they?

17:27.203 --> 17:29.842
Live His commandments
better than we do.

17:29.909 --> 17:31.546
- This isn't right, Dan.

17:31.613 --> 17:32.748
This isn't--

17:35.521 --> 17:36.823
I don't know about this, Dan.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.127
- And that's what we are here
to address, Robin,

17:39.193 --> 17:40.396
our lack of knowledge.

17:44.839 --> 17:46.408
Quiet here, huh?

17:54.090 --> 17:57.129
There's a lotta houses in need
of that finishing touch, eh?

17:59.134 --> 18:01.372
It's a joke. I'm joking.

18:01.438 --> 18:04.177
Can't charge property tax
on a building

18:04.243 --> 18:06.682
that ain't finished, right?

18:06.749 --> 18:08.485
Yeah.
You guys got it figured out.

18:09.888 --> 18:13.362
Yeah, up north,
they charge property tax

18:13.428 --> 18:16.001
on a home that my dad
owns outright.

18:16.067 --> 18:18.072
Yeah, it's like the government
who actually owns it.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.542
It's highway robbery.

18:19.609 --> 18:21.445
You finish up here.

18:21.513 --> 18:23.883
Let these men get on
their way, Brother Nichols.

18:42.688 --> 18:44.324
- You guys practice
polygamy here?

18:44.391 --> 18:45.593
Dan.

18:45.660 --> 18:47.197
- No, well,
I've been reading about it--

18:47.263 --> 18:50.169
how our church changed
the rules over time.

18:50.236 --> 18:51.806
It started when
we abandoned the doctrine

18:51.873 --> 18:52.941
of plural marriage.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.045
That's when it started.
I mean, you tell me.

18:56.749 --> 19:00.155
From what I read,
prophet who renounced it,

19:00.222 --> 19:03.095
he just wanted to keep federal
troops from marching into Utah.

19:03.162 --> 19:04.632
That's all.

19:04.698 --> 19:07.704
Ol' Woodruff
had nine wives himself.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.713
You folks, you just
kept on doing it, huh?

19:11.780 --> 19:13.282
- We do not pretend
to know more

19:13.348 --> 19:15.654
than the founding prophets.

19:15.721 --> 19:17.323
We do not change their beliefs

19:17.390 --> 19:19.027
to suit
the fashion of the time.

19:19.094 --> 19:21.398
- That's what
I'm talking about.

19:21.465 --> 19:24.204
What happens
if the cops come around?

19:24.270 --> 19:26.776
- "If man's law conflicts
with heaven's,

19:26.843 --> 19:28.579
"then the faithful
will be ranged

19:28.646 --> 19:31.418
under the banner of heaven
against them."

19:34.290 --> 19:36.796
- Prophet Taylor, right?
I dig it, man.

19:36.862 --> 19:38.399
All right, I think we're
pretty much finished here.

19:38.466 --> 19:39.935
Mr. Nichols,
we'll head out now.

19:40.002 --> 19:41.304
You know, hey.

19:42.808 --> 19:45.045
I want to be
as good of a saint as I can.

19:45.112 --> 19:48.251
But everybody up north,
they're just so concerned

19:48.318 --> 19:51.324
with being a good American too.

19:51.391 --> 19:53.028
I just need some guidance.

19:53.095 --> 19:54.698
D&C 132 says that,

19:54.765 --> 19:57.437
"If a man espouse a virgin
and desire to espouse another,

19:57.504 --> 19:58.974
"then he is justified.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.512
He cannot commit adultery
for they are given unto him."

20:01.579 --> 20:02.748
Dan.
- I gotta know, Brother.

20:02.814 --> 20:04.217
I gotta know.
Dan, it's time to go.

20:04.283 --> 20:07.256
- I gotta know, is polygamy
a part of salvation, Brother?

20:07.323 --> 20:09.461
- Joseph Smith calls it
The Principle.

20:09.528 --> 20:10.931
In The Peace Maker.

20:10.998 --> 20:12.299
- Get on your way!

20:16.342 --> 20:17.511
- "Peace Maker."

20:19.013 --> 20:20.884
The Peace Maker.

20:37.316 --> 20:39.655
You know, Bill,
doing business with the FLDS

20:39.721 --> 20:41.291
is kind of like doing it
with the mafia.

20:41.358 --> 20:43.261
You don't just walk away
on your own terms.

20:43.328 --> 20:46.367
So if our church
finds out that--

20:46.434 --> 20:48.540
that Robin

20:48.606 --> 20:50.677
continued to do business
with fundamentalists,

20:50.744 --> 20:53.348
continued to visit
fundamentalists who--

20:53.415 --> 20:55.720
who marry off 13-year-old girls

20:55.787 --> 21:00.830
to 70-year-old men
to be raped and enslaved...

21:02.467 --> 21:04.838
And to be punished
if they seek help...

21:07.744 --> 21:09.380
Brother...

21:11.084 --> 21:13.321
I don't have to tell you
that your excommunication

21:13.388 --> 21:15.493
would be right around
the corner.

21:15.560 --> 21:18.533
- I have the right
to a phone call, don't I?

21:22.507 --> 21:24.678
I think I'll be
utilizing that now.

21:29.555 --> 21:31.659
Right now, Detective.

21:43.215 --> 21:44.852
- Okay, so two days ago,

21:44.919 --> 21:47.156
the Lows charged a hefty bill
at a sporting goods store.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.993
I talked to the clerk there.

21:49.060 --> 21:50.797
He said that they picked up
some fly-fishing gear

21:50.863 --> 21:53.970
and they were talking about,
um, conditions

21:54.037 --> 21:55.272
up at Granddaddy Mountain.

21:55.339 --> 21:57.209
Granddaddy Mountain?
- Yes, sir.

21:57.276 --> 21:59.013
- So get up there.
If the Lows are still alive,

21:59.080 --> 22:00.917
they may know
how they ended up on this list,

22:00.984 --> 22:02.621
and even better,

22:02.688 --> 22:05.660
where Dianna
and Matilda are now.

22:05.727 --> 22:10.102
- Okay, and--and if I find,
say, a suspect or something?

22:10.168 --> 22:11.505
- You radio us.
- Right.

22:11.572 --> 22:13.042
All right?
- Yes, sir.

22:13.108 --> 22:15.445
Use your training.
- Yes, sir.

22:16.414 --> 22:18.152
- Send that kid out alone,

22:18.219 --> 22:20.355
he's liable to get
pecked to death by songbirds.

22:20.422 --> 22:22.026
Who else have I got?

22:25.265 --> 22:27.069
- Concerned about Dianna?

22:28.873 --> 22:29.675
- Yeah.

22:29.742 --> 22:32.279
Any new information

22:32.346 --> 22:34.552
that, uh,
speaks to her welfare?

22:34.619 --> 22:38.125
- No, Lloyd, um,
contacted her folks.

22:38.191 --> 22:39.795
Divorced, non-Mormon.

22:39.862 --> 22:41.533
They haven't heard from her
for a long time.

22:41.599 --> 22:43.903
Her dad said, uh...

22:45.239 --> 22:49.447
That she joined a cult,
as far as he was concerned.

22:49.515 --> 22:51.652
- We'll find her. We will.

22:51.719 --> 22:53.789
- Yeah. We got to.

22:55.359 --> 22:57.664
- Love note?
- Kinda.

23:00.369 --> 23:01.672
Raising up
a couple of Picassos.

23:01.739 --> 23:04.010
Thank you.

23:04.076 --> 23:06.582
- Yeah, no. Thank you.

23:06.648 --> 23:09.521
- Detectives, evidence files
for Dan Lafferty.

23:09.588 --> 23:11.258
In from Salt Lake City.

23:19.340 --> 23:21.344
"On May 7th, 1982,

23:21.411 --> 23:25.185
"at- 30 or- 30 p.m.,
we were about 20 minutes

23:25.252 --> 23:26.522
outside of Salt Lake..."
- I'll be back.

23:26.589 --> 23:28.358
- Yeah.
"On the I-15..."

23:28.425 --> 23:30.262
Do you know how
I've been studying at BYU

23:30.329 --> 23:33.936
to be the best priesthood
holder and husband that I can?

23:34.003 --> 23:35.807
Couldn't find all
the original teachings there,

23:35.874 --> 23:38.111
so I went
to an antiques dealer.

23:38.178 --> 23:43.255
And he sold me something...

23:43.322 --> 23:46.094
Very, very special.

23:50.737 --> 23:52.741
Take a look at that.

23:55.045 --> 23:56.683
Yeah.

23:56.749 --> 23:58.051
The Peace Maker.

23:58.118 --> 23:59.888
- Start--start where
it's book-marked.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.532
- Is this from my
wedding bouquet?

24:04.598 --> 24:08.806
Um, "Man is under
governing power of his wife,

24:08.873 --> 24:12.347
"and wife is under
governing power of her husband.

24:12.413 --> 24:14.217
"Now, which shall
be subservient?

24:14.283 --> 24:17.089
"Certainly neither where
both have equal power.

24:17.156 --> 24:21.532
"By depriving him of the right
of marrying more than one wife,

24:21.599 --> 24:24.437
"um, you totally annihilate his
power of peaceable government

24:24.505 --> 24:27.476
"over a woman

24:27.544 --> 24:29.180
"and deprive the family of its

24:29.246 --> 24:31.185
lawful and necessary head."
- "Lawful and necessary head."

24:31.251 --> 24:32.453
- What is this?

24:32.521 --> 24:35.527
- That?
An essential LDS tract,

24:35.594 --> 24:40.102
printed by
Joseph Smith himself.

24:40.169 --> 24:42.574
And it also says that a man
needs at least three wives

24:42.641 --> 24:44.578
to achieve full exaltation
into heaven.

24:44.644 --> 24:47.049
Did you know Joseph Smith
had 33 wives?

24:47.116 --> 24:48.218
33.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.458
His youngest was 14.

24:51.525 --> 24:53.830
- No.

24:53.896 --> 24:56.068
But if it's so essential,

24:56.134 --> 24:58.271
why have I never heard of it,
like, in church?

24:58.338 --> 25:00.442
Well, because
the U.S. government has been

25:00.510 --> 25:03.816
whittling away our doctrines
for over a hundred years.

25:03.883 --> 25:05.887
But our church vowed

25:05.954 --> 25:07.924
that if man's laws
ever conflicted with ours

25:07.991 --> 25:09.562
that we would be ranged
under the banner of heaven

25:09.628 --> 25:11.599
and against the government.

25:11.665 --> 25:15.105
So this is what my father
set me on track to find,

25:15.172 --> 25:16.609
to understand God's laws

25:16.675 --> 25:17.945
and how we have
perverted them with man's.

25:18.012 --> 25:21.117
Perverted them? Right.

25:21.184 --> 25:23.556
Do you know
what sounds perverted to me?

25:23.622 --> 25:25.392
Is, uh, collecting wives.

25:25.459 --> 25:28.298
- Was Abraham a pervert?

25:28.365 --> 25:30.636
Huh?
Was--was Moses a pervert?

25:30.703 --> 25:32.106
- I don't know.
How should I know that?

25:32.173 --> 25:35.012
I didn't marry
Moses or Abraham.

25:35.078 --> 25:36.649
Do you want to have
an affair on me, Dan?

25:36.716 --> 25:38.151
Is that--is that
what this is about?

25:38.218 --> 25:40.356
Do I not satisfy you anymore?
No, no, no, no!

25:40.423 --> 25:44.030
And you will not speak to me
in that manner ever again!

25:44.096 --> 25:45.666
You understand?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.440
How can you possibly
see me as the head,

25:49.508 --> 25:52.981
the way I see Christ,
if it's just the two of us?

25:53.047 --> 25:55.419
- You don't have to go
marrying more women.

25:55.485 --> 25:56.923
I know that you're the head.

25:56.989 --> 25:59.460
- You always say that you can't
be happy unless I am happy

25:59.528 --> 26:00.897
so I won't be so frustrated
anymore,

26:00.964 --> 26:02.166
and you won't be so afraid

26:02.232 --> 26:04.638
of falling short
of my expectations

26:04.705 --> 26:06.542
because you won't be
the one-and-only!

26:08.178 --> 26:09.514
Dan, you need to pull over.

26:09.581 --> 26:12.219
If you can just get over
your dang jealousy,

26:12.286 --> 26:15.158
you might see what a blessing
this principle is for you too.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.596
- Can you pull over?

26:38.773 --> 26:41.979
- Howdy, officer.
What seems to be the problem?

26:42.046 --> 26:44.116
- You were speeding, and you're
missing an inspection sticker.

26:44.183 --> 26:45.620
Oh.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.357
Can you roll the window
all the way down, please?

26:47.423 --> 26:48.960
You wouldn't happen
to have pulled me over because,

26:49.026 --> 26:50.596
uh, you read about
my run for sheriff

26:50.663 --> 26:51.699
in the paper, would you?

26:51.765 --> 26:53.168
Can't say that I did.

26:53.235 --> 26:54.370
Oh, okay.

26:54.437 --> 26:56.408
Well, Matilda, would you show
the good officer?

26:56.475 --> 26:58.445
Now, see, I know it
disappoints you to hear that

26:58.512 --> 27:00.917
I'll be enforcing
strict separation of powers,

27:00.984 --> 27:03.155
so no more unlawful arrests
and--

27:03.222 --> 27:05.259
- I got backup
at the ready, Dan.

27:05.326 --> 27:06.361
- I'm sure you do.

27:06.427 --> 27:07.998
I'm sure you've had
backup ready all day.

27:08.064 --> 27:10.135
If you know want to arrest me,
you know where I live.

27:10.202 --> 27:11.805
Get a warrant,
have it signed by a judge,

27:11.872 --> 27:13.777
and bring it by my home.

27:13.843 --> 27:16.649
- Okay.
Step out of the car, Dan.

27:16.715 --> 27:18.352
- No.

27:21.558 --> 27:24.330
What are you doing?

27:24.397 --> 27:25.332
You could have killed him.

27:25.399 --> 27:27.436
- They're trying
to derail my campaign

27:27.504 --> 27:29.909
and sabotage me!

27:37.624 --> 27:39.293
What are you doing,
trying to kill me?

27:39.360 --> 27:41.632
- I'm not! They are!

28:05.680 --> 28:07.149
God's giving me an opportunity.

28:14.029 --> 28:19.040
Tyrants! Tyrants! Witness!
Witness the tyrants!

28:19.107 --> 28:22.647
Witness! Witness the tyrants!

28:22.714 --> 28:25.185
Witness!

28:25.252 --> 28:27.089
Witness the tyrants! Witness!
Game over, Dan.

28:27.156 --> 28:28.291
Game over.

28:47.429 --> 28:48.732
Let's go.

28:58.853 --> 29:00.322
Hey, Pyre.

29:02.426 --> 29:03.929
I'm finished
answering your questions.

29:03.996 --> 29:05.866
My representative
is on his way.

29:14.484 --> 29:17.023
- So we think that Dan
remained the family leader

29:17.089 --> 29:20.897
even after your folks
came back from their mission.

29:20.964 --> 29:22.600
And we're aware
that he was advocating

29:22.667 --> 29:25.673
for constitutional literalism,

29:25.740 --> 29:28.345
but now we--

29:28.412 --> 29:30.049
we suspect
he was also exploring

29:30.115 --> 29:31.519
fundamentalist Mormonism.

29:31.585 --> 29:37.497
- He took Robin on a lookie-loo
to an FLDS compound.

29:37.563 --> 29:40.169
Maybe he let some of those men
in his life?

29:40.235 --> 29:42.039
Could have been
the bearded men you saw.

29:42.106 --> 29:44.878
- Uh, I guess it's possible.

29:44.945 --> 29:46.548
- Yeah, you think?

29:46.615 --> 29:48.953
He ever discuss this with you?

29:59.908 --> 30:01.211
See, it's--it's no different

30:01.278 --> 30:02.713
than the
chiropractic principle.

30:02.780 --> 30:04.316
If you're out of alignment,

30:04.383 --> 30:05.753
then your whole body
begins to fail,

30:05.820 --> 30:09.728
and we have been out
of alignment with God's plan.

30:09.795 --> 30:13.201
I mean, is it any wonder
that there's such discourse

30:13.268 --> 30:15.640
and disorder across the world?

30:15.707 --> 30:17.209
I mean...

30:17.276 --> 30:18.612
How can it be any--
how can it be otherwise

30:18.679 --> 30:21.083
when men are beset
with lust and frustration?

30:21.150 --> 30:22.787
God could not be
any more clear.

30:22.854 --> 30:25.359
We need to assert absolute
control in our married lives.

30:25.426 --> 30:29.768
- So if I get Brenda
to--to agree

30:29.834 --> 30:31.237
to the--
the "absolute control" thing...

30:31.303 --> 30:32.574
- Mm-hmm.

30:32.641 --> 30:35.412
- Is the multiple wives
thing mandatory 'cause--

30:35.479 --> 30:37.917
- Well, if you want to get to
the Celestial Kingdom, it is.

30:42.928 --> 30:45.265
- It's too far. It's too far.

30:45.331 --> 30:47.970
It's illegal, and there's too
much at stake for all of us.

30:48.037 --> 30:51.812
- Ron, our forebears
never fretted about

30:51.879 --> 30:55.418
how much they risked by
standing firm in their faith.

30:55.485 --> 30:59.494
- My faith. Yeah.

30:59.561 --> 31:01.565
Ah, Dan.

31:03.301 --> 31:05.004
Daniel.
Mm-hmm.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.042
Ow, Ron.
- Arise and awake...

31:07.109 --> 31:09.915
Ron.
- To your awful situation.

31:09.981 --> 31:11.518
Ron, you're gonna
break his hand.

31:11.585 --> 31:12.987
- If we don't regain
our footing,

31:13.054 --> 31:14.490
I'll lose my business,
I'll lose everything.

31:14.557 --> 31:17.664
- Ron, Mom, Mom--
Mom always said it was true.

31:17.730 --> 31:19.601
She did, and now I know it.

31:19.668 --> 31:23.374
I know it that you--

31:23.441 --> 31:26.180
ow!
You are the true leader of us.

31:30.657 --> 31:32.760
We all know that Dad
only chose me to lead things

31:32.827 --> 31:34.163
because he's grown weak,

31:34.229 --> 31:37.002
and he's afraid
of your strength.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.940
And I need to cleanse myself
spiritually now,

31:39.006 --> 31:40.676
as you can see.

31:40.743 --> 31:41.912
Mm?

31:43.682 --> 31:45.520
But it's you, Ron. It's you.

31:45.587 --> 31:47.924
You are the true leader
of our family.

31:50.028 --> 31:53.502
- I don't know about that.
- I do. I do.

31:56.173 --> 31:59.013
Shoulder this responsibility
for us.

31:59.080 --> 32:01.484
Fight these criminal tax laws.

32:01.552 --> 32:05.926
Get the government
out of our pockets, hmm?

32:05.993 --> 32:08.331
It's up to you now, Ron.

32:11.905 --> 32:15.011
- You all feel the same way?

32:15.078 --> 32:17.149
'Cause if you all feel
that this is

32:17.216 --> 32:19.086
Heavenly Father's desire,
stand.

32:21.324 --> 32:24.030
If no one--if no one--
if no one objects.

32:24.096 --> 32:26.502
Right?

32:26.568 --> 32:27.870
Okay?

32:34.651 --> 32:37.690
If this is His desire,
then, um...

32:45.405 --> 32:47.544
- Do me a favor, buddy.

32:47.610 --> 32:52.386
Will you--will you pray
on The Peace Maker for me?

32:52.452 --> 32:54.658
I know I heard
the Heavenly Father's voice,

32:54.725 --> 32:58.699
and I just so badly want to see
you and Brenda in heaven.

32:58.766 --> 33:00.937
Can you do that for me?

33:01.003 --> 33:02.874
Okay.

33:02.941 --> 33:05.178
Allen.

33:05.245 --> 33:08.986
I prayed on--
on what he said.

33:09.052 --> 33:10.689
I fasted.

33:14.130 --> 33:17.269
But I--I couldn't hear
the Holy Spirit

33:17.336 --> 33:19.507
in the same way
my brothers could.

33:19.574 --> 33:21.043
I thought there was
something wrong with me.

33:21.110 --> 33:23.048
- Well, you know
that the church

33:23.114 --> 33:24.651
has long forbidden polygamy.

33:24.718 --> 33:26.989
- Today's prophets
still believe

33:27.055 --> 33:28.424
it's practiced in heaven.

33:28.491 --> 33:29.727
- Allen, it's unholy
here on Earth.

33:29.794 --> 33:31.030
Is it?

33:31.097 --> 33:35.205
I mean, why was Joseph Smith
almost killed in Illinois?

33:35.271 --> 33:37.309
"Prophet" Joseph Smith...

33:37.376 --> 33:40.148
It wasn't just because
he was unfaithful to Emma.

33:40.215 --> 33:43.990
He was acting upon
his principle here on Earth.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.393
'Cept now we
have a witness to your crimes

33:46.460 --> 33:48.599
and whoredoms
committed over and again

33:48.666 --> 33:50.201
with an unmarried woman.

33:50.268 --> 33:52.673
Taking wives,

33:52.740 --> 33:56.615
some of them
so very, very young.

33:58.952 --> 34:02.961
Once I learned what Joseph did,

34:03.027 --> 34:05.767
I still put my faith in him,

34:05.833 --> 34:09.808
so I believed
I could still love Dan

34:09.874 --> 34:13.048
despite all of it too.

34:13.115 --> 34:15.051
But instead,

34:15.118 --> 34:18.659
like Emma, I, uh...

34:18.726 --> 34:20.496
I was sick about it.

34:28.344 --> 34:31.283
Joseph,
your brother Hyrum visited.

34:31.350 --> 34:35.793
He brought me your revelation.

34:37.797 --> 34:41.604
In an attempt to persuade me
of its purity, I assume.

34:41.671 --> 34:43.709
"If any man espouse
a virgin and desire

34:43.776 --> 34:47.717
to espouse another,
he is justified."

34:47.784 --> 34:52.593
Who else follows this
revelation now?

34:52.660 --> 34:53.596
Brigham Young?

34:53.662 --> 34:55.298
Only His anointed men.

34:55.365 --> 34:57.536
Ours is an ever-evolving
church, Emma.

34:59.641 --> 35:03.014
And Father knew it would
inspire opposition so fervent

35:03.080 --> 35:06.086
that it would cut down
our church ere it grew roots.

35:06.153 --> 35:08.559
- We made a vow, Joseph.

35:08.626 --> 35:10.128
And I will not stand
to watch you say

35:10.195 --> 35:11.364
it is holy to marry others

35:11.431 --> 35:14.169
because you've grown
bored of me.

35:17.076 --> 35:19.113
To marry mere girls.
I refuse.

35:19.179 --> 35:21.483
- You accuse me

35:21.551 --> 35:25.359
of falsifying revelations
to suit my own desires?

35:25.425 --> 35:29.634
- I was at your side
when you discovered the plates.

35:29.701 --> 35:31.938
I was your scribe as you
dictated their every word,

35:32.005 --> 35:36.214
and I publicly supported
their divine authenticity.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.217
So are you certain
in asking me now

35:38.284 --> 35:40.288
to believe
that the Lord in heaven

35:40.355 --> 35:44.931
commands you
to take more wives?

35:44.998 --> 35:47.335
- Pray on it, Emma.

35:49.106 --> 35:52.580
- Fine. Go forth, Joseph.

35:54.685 --> 35:56.688
So shall I,

35:56.755 --> 36:00.596
as he must want me
to take more husbands as well.

36:01.799 --> 36:03.735
And I will.

36:14.389 --> 36:16.728
- Thus sayeth the Lord...

36:18.799 --> 36:22.706
"I command mine handmaid
Emma Smith

36:22.773 --> 36:26.347
"to abide and cleave
unto my servant, Joseph,

36:26.414 --> 36:29.286
"and to none else.

36:29.352 --> 36:33.161
But if she will not abide
this commandment..."

36:39.874 --> 36:42.412
"She shall be destroyed."

36:42.479 --> 36:45.619
- The Heavenly Father
will destroy me?

36:45.686 --> 36:47.523
Me?

36:50.027 --> 36:52.398
Are you certain, Prophet?

37:00.115 --> 37:02.587
I did what the church
taught us to do--

37:02.654 --> 37:05.793
put my questions on the shelf.

37:07.195 --> 37:10.970
It's hard to keep them
up there,

37:11.036 --> 37:13.240
isn't it?

37:19.019 --> 37:20.723
- Did Dan keep his questions
on the shelf?

37:20.790 --> 37:24.831
- If the men I saw
were from Colorado City,

37:24.898 --> 37:26.801
then I guess
you have your answer, right?

37:26.868 --> 37:31.410
- If an LDS man chooses
to take up polygamy again,

37:31.477 --> 37:34.717
then why not blood atonement?

37:37.088 --> 37:39.359
Slippery slope, isn't it?

37:54.323 --> 37:57.095
Dan Lafferty
is off the ballot for sheriff

37:57.162 --> 38:00.703
for refusing to pay
a $15 processing fee,

38:00.770 --> 38:02.272
but he emerged from jail today

38:02.339 --> 38:05.679
to find he's not off the minds
of local Libertarians.

38:05.746 --> 38:10.589
- He doesn't look too cheesed
off about his failed campaign.

38:10.656 --> 38:12.694
What are we missing here, Jeb?

38:12.760 --> 38:14.931
Motive.

38:14.998 --> 38:16.466
- You all right?

38:16.534 --> 38:18.470
We're chasing our tails.

38:21.544 --> 38:23.915
- What is Robert Wagner
doing here?

38:23.982 --> 38:25.819
- What?
And why are our guys

38:25.886 --> 38:27.890
greeting him like
he's Danny freakin' White?

38:29.426 --> 38:31.029
- I'll take care of it.

38:34.504 --> 38:36.841
- Brother Pyre.

38:36.908 --> 38:40.381
I'm Orton Ballard,
president of Robin's stake.

38:40.448 --> 38:41.785
He phoned me a brief while ago.

38:41.852 --> 38:44.322
- President Ballard,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

38:44.389 --> 38:45.592
How, um, how can I help?

38:45.659 --> 38:49.199
- Well, Robin told me
he's badly in need

38:49.266 --> 38:51.939
of spiritual counsel,
and under the circumstances,

38:52.005 --> 38:54.777
he must be carrying
a heavy burden indeed.

38:54.844 --> 38:55.947
- If--if you're here
to visit him,

38:56.013 --> 39:00.556
I--I ask if it can
wait for tomorrow.

39:00.622 --> 39:03.427
We're--we--the case
is very active right now.

39:03.495 --> 39:07.402
- I know Heavenly Father
won't let you rest

39:07.469 --> 39:09.239
until the evildoers
are in hand,

39:09.306 --> 39:13.782
but Robin's a good boy,
as are Allen and Sam,

39:13.849 --> 39:18.490
and seeing all three
in need of healing prayer,

39:18.558 --> 39:21.531
I'd like you to release them
into my custody.

39:21.598 --> 39:23.034
- Perhaps we can talk
in private.

39:23.100 --> 39:25.906
- Oh, there's no need
to trouble yourself.

39:27.643 --> 39:30.649
- I don't feel it's prudent
to release them just yet.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.419
- Is everything all right?

39:32.485 --> 39:34.958
- It's a very ghastly,
complicated case,

39:35.024 --> 39:36.260
and we're all
doing our best here--

39:36.327 --> 39:39.801
- Oh, no, I mean with you.

39:39.867 --> 39:43.509
You're carrying so much here
and at home--

39:43.575 --> 39:47.482
your mother, her suffering.

39:47.549 --> 39:50.923
Your bishop told me
after he met with you

39:50.990 --> 39:53.495
and your wife
about your daughters' baptism,

39:53.561 --> 39:58.404
you introduced
some provocative questions.

39:58.471 --> 40:00.743
"Blood atonement?"

40:00.810 --> 40:04.049
This case
must weigh heavy on you.

40:04.115 --> 40:07.990
But perhaps some questions
man isn't meant to answer.

40:11.163 --> 40:13.869
Trust the priesthood.

40:13.936 --> 40:16.340
Release the brothers
into my custody.

40:16.407 --> 40:19.179
- Put my questions
on the shelf?

40:21.751 --> 40:23.988
Respectfully, sir,
I'm--I'm not detaining

40:24.055 --> 40:26.561
the Lafferty brothers
for a questioning mind.

40:26.627 --> 40:30.368
I'm investigating a murder.

40:30.435 --> 40:34.611
- We've all made covenants
to protect the Lord's Kingdom,

40:34.678 --> 40:38.384
even unto laying down
our lives.

40:38.451 --> 40:41.525
Now, we wouldn't want anything
to embarrass the church,

40:41.592 --> 40:45.064
would we, Brother?

40:45.131 --> 40:49.206
I trust you recall
the repercussions of sharing

40:49.273 --> 40:51.678
what is heaven's alone.

40:58.090 --> 40:59.593
- Thank you so much.

41:29.787 --> 41:30.889
- Sorry, sir.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.395
What is it?

41:34.462 --> 41:36.100
- Couple boys showed up
at Bishop Low's home,

41:36.167 --> 41:38.070
say they know something
about who broke in.

41:40.475 --> 41:43.515
- All right, good.
Good. Let's go.

41:50.496 --> 41:51.832
So you were rolling around
and you stopped, where?

41:51.899 --> 41:52.800
Right around here, yeah.

41:52.866 --> 41:54.637
- Why'd you stop here?

41:54.704 --> 41:56.473
- The car in the driveway,
it wasn't the Lows',

41:56.541 --> 41:58.077
and there were two men
in the back.

41:58.144 --> 41:59.880
- Did you get a look
at the men?

41:59.947 --> 42:03.154
- Honestly, sir,
we didn't get very close.

42:03.220 --> 42:04.356
They--they worried us.

42:04.423 --> 42:06.594
Why'd they worry you?

42:06.661 --> 42:07.896
- They were just sitting there.

42:07.963 --> 42:09.433
They weren't talking
to each other or anything,

42:09.500 --> 42:11.872
and they had long hair, sir.

42:11.938 --> 42:13.675
- Long like when you need
a haircut or--

42:13.742 --> 42:15.713
- Yes, sir.
Long like a woman's.

42:15.780 --> 42:16.848
All right, good.

42:16.915 --> 42:18.417
- Did you get a look
at the car?

42:18.484 --> 42:20.956
- It was a green station wagon.

42:21.023 --> 42:22.726
An Impala, sir.

42:22.793 --> 42:24.831
My parents had one
until Heavenly Father

42:24.898 --> 42:27.002
answered my prayer
for a Skyhawk.

42:28.939 --> 42:31.511
Green station wagon Impala.
- Yes, sir.

43:07.783 --> 43:09.920
Allen.

43:13.126 --> 43:15.297
This is Ron's car, isn't it?

43:17.503 --> 43:18.771
- Yeah.

43:18.838 --> 43:20.175
- It was spotted at the home
of the Lows'

43:20.241 --> 43:21.712
on the day of the murder.

43:21.778 --> 43:23.782
Now the Lows are missing.

43:23.849 --> 43:26.086
- What are you--
what are you saying?

43:26.153 --> 43:29.627
What, that they got
to Ron, too, or--

43:29.693 --> 43:32.399
or that they stole it?

43:32.466 --> 43:34.469
Or Dan did?

43:34.537 --> 43:37.242
- Dianna sent this.

43:37.308 --> 43:38.945
To the Prophet.

43:41.852 --> 43:44.055
"Dear President Kimball,

43:44.122 --> 43:48.063
"We write aware of how busy
Heavenly Father keeps you.

43:48.898 --> 43:51.003
We need your guidance..."

43:51.070 --> 43:54.042
"So desperately.

43:54.109 --> 43:57.850
"Our husbands have begun
questioning some federal laws

43:57.916 --> 44:01.223
"they believe conflict
with LDS teachings.

44:01.290 --> 44:03.360
"Still, our prayers
tell us that

44:03.427 --> 44:05.165
"a good Mormon abides the law.

44:05.231 --> 44:07.903
"Please counsel us
on Heavenly Father's will.

44:07.970 --> 44:11.043
"Is it ever right
for a Mormon to break a law

44:11.110 --> 44:13.548
"they feel violates
our church beliefs?

44:13.615 --> 44:16.721
My husband--"
Are we sure about this?

44:16.787 --> 44:20.629
- I think so.
I think it's really good.

44:20.695 --> 44:23.467
Yeah?

44:23.534 --> 44:24.604
Yeah!

44:28.512 --> 44:33.621
- Br--Brenda wrote this.

44:33.688 --> 44:35.324
I--I can hear her voice.

44:35.391 --> 44:37.863
Did she ever tell you
about this letter?

44:39.967 --> 44:42.907
No.
At some point, she--

44:42.973 --> 44:47.115
she stopped complaining
about my brothers.

44:47.182 --> 44:50.321
I assumed she...

44:50.387 --> 44:53.260
she'd just
thrown up her hands about them.

44:53.327 --> 44:55.130
And about me.

44:55.197 --> 44:57.603
But, uh,

44:57.670 --> 45:01.511
she still loved me.

45:08.825 --> 45:14.169
She--she'd see, you know, how--

45:14.235 --> 45:17.943
how I struggled
to stand up to them.

45:18.010 --> 45:22.118
So she did the standing.

45:23.955 --> 45:27.797
- Did Ron ever tell you
about this letter?

45:27.863 --> 45:30.234
- No.

45:35.679 --> 45:38.317
- Holy wow, Robin.

45:38.384 --> 45:41.825
You called your stake president
to get you out of jail?

45:41.891 --> 45:44.462
May be the most saintly act
of entitlement

45:44.530 --> 45:46.333
I've ever witnessed.

45:46.400 --> 45:47.803
- You know,
you should really, um,

45:47.869 --> 45:49.439
tell your partner here
who we regard

45:49.506 --> 45:51.878
as the higher authority,
the church or the police.

45:51.945 --> 45:55.351
I don't have to tell you that
disrespecting church authority

45:55.418 --> 45:58.892
puts your own salvation
in the balance.

45:58.958 --> 46:01.196
- Well, there's that.

46:03.200 --> 46:06.072
- If you can answer me
one more question, Robin.

46:06.139 --> 46:10.649
Was Ron at war
with Dan's views...

46:10.715 --> 46:13.354
or was he drawn
to his ideas too?

46:13.420 --> 46:17.094
- Well, Ron stayed out of it
until our father,

46:17.161 --> 46:20.401
who was getting sicker
and weaker,

46:20.468 --> 46:22.773
finally swallowed his pride,
practically begged Ron

46:22.840 --> 46:26.548
to help bring Dan back in line.

46:26.614 --> 46:31.256
- You got to remember
Article of Faith 12.

46:33.694 --> 46:37.736
"We believe in being subject
to kings, presidents, rulers,

46:37.803 --> 46:42.378
"and magistrates
in obeying, honoring,

46:42.445 --> 46:44.517
and sustaining the law."

46:44.583 --> 46:45.885
If you get yourself
thrown in jail,

46:45.952 --> 46:49.225
you're mocking our prophet.
So...

46:49.292 --> 46:53.034
What brought this to mind, Ron?

46:53.100 --> 46:55.271
This unexpected visit?

46:55.338 --> 46:56.942
- I felt a calling
from the Lord.

46:57.008 --> 46:58.444
Oh.

46:58.512 --> 46:59.980
You sure it wasn't
a calling from Dad?

47:01.584 --> 47:04.890
D&C 98, 6 and 7--
"I the Lord justify

47:04.957 --> 47:08.531
"you and your brethren of my
church to befriend the law,

47:08.598 --> 47:10.536
"which is the constitutional
law of the land,

47:10.602 --> 47:14.944
whatsoever is more or less
than this cometh of evil."

47:15.011 --> 47:17.482
And the 16th Amendment
is clearly "more than"

47:17.550 --> 47:19.085
what the Constitution once was.
It is evil.

47:19.152 --> 47:20.889
- Until the--until the church

47:20.956 --> 47:22.559
calls us
to break the law, then--

47:22.626 --> 47:25.331
- It can't.
That is why Joseph wanted us

47:25.398 --> 47:27.770
to directly correspond
with Heavenly Father,

47:27.836 --> 47:30.341
so we should "depend upon
no person for borrowed light,

47:30.407 --> 47:31.878
"trusting only
unto the Holy Spirit,

47:31.944 --> 47:33.047
who is ever the same."

47:33.114 --> 47:34.182
- There's no place
in the church

47:34.248 --> 47:36.053
for extremes, Dan, right?

47:36.120 --> 47:38.558
- What about extremely good,
Ron?

47:38.624 --> 47:39.927
How about extremely good?

47:39.993 --> 47:42.732
The government keeps
changing their rules.

47:42.799 --> 47:46.173
We're simply trying to sustain
the rules that we started with,

47:46.239 --> 47:48.911
our heavenly inspired
constitution.

47:48.978 --> 47:51.584
I mean, it's the only way
out of this mess

47:51.651 --> 47:53.053
and back to God's plan.

47:53.120 --> 47:55.625
- God's plan? What's your plan?
Just to get us thrown in jail?

47:55.692 --> 47:57.228
Is that your plan?
Or are you gonna become sheriff

47:57.294 --> 47:58.965
and stack the juries
and rule how you wish?

47:59.032 --> 48:00.100
Because if you do,
that's an embarrassment.

48:00.167 --> 48:02.438
- Ron.
How do you think we feel?

48:02.505 --> 48:05.512
I--I'm embarrassed I can
barely support my family.

48:05.578 --> 48:07.549
I wish that we could
all be as successful,

48:07.616 --> 48:09.218
as--as well off as you are,
but that's--

48:09.285 --> 48:11.524
Watch your tone with me,
all right?

48:11.591 --> 48:14.429
- I'm sorry.
All right. I'm sorry.

48:14.497 --> 48:16.033
- I'm curious.

48:16.099 --> 48:19.674
Does it help your profits

48:19.740 --> 48:22.045
to obey these illegal laws?

48:22.112 --> 48:24.215
- What?
- Yes or no?

48:27.990 --> 48:30.194
But you follow them anyhow.

48:30.261 --> 48:33.935
And why? Because you're scared.

48:34.002 --> 48:36.039
- Dan--
Dad--Dad'll be gone soon,

48:36.106 --> 48:38.310
and what has he left us with?

48:38.377 --> 48:41.551
Lafferty men used to run things
in this state.

48:41.618 --> 48:44.523
And I've had a vision to set
things back in that order.

48:44.590 --> 48:46.393
Now, if you don't want
to be a part of that,

48:46.460 --> 48:47.361
then you should
change your name

48:47.428 --> 48:49.867
if all we do is embarrass you

48:49.933 --> 48:54.208
because you're either a part
of this family or you are not.

48:59.620 --> 49:01.891
I think it might be time
for you to leave, Ron.

49:01.957 --> 49:04.664
- Okay.
Shut up and let me think.

49:04.731 --> 49:06.534
You know, just--

49:11.276 --> 49:13.982
I do own my own home,
and I do own my own business.

49:14.049 --> 49:15.518
You all know that.

49:15.585 --> 49:19.092
So did someone tell you that
I'm--I'm gonna lose it all?

49:19.159 --> 49:20.261
Is that why you're speaking
this way to me?

49:20.328 --> 49:21.897
- Ron--

49:21.964 --> 49:24.035
You want to cut me down
in front of my own brothers?

49:24.102 --> 49:25.905
Is that what you want?
- Ron.

49:25.972 --> 49:27.441
I did not know that.

49:27.509 --> 49:29.346
- Just--
- Hey, Ron. No, no, no.

49:29.412 --> 49:31.717
- Don't touch me, man.
You shame me.

49:31.784 --> 49:33.220
I didn't know that.

49:36.760 --> 49:39.432
Ron, you suffer
because you're persecuted.

49:39.499 --> 49:42.238
And "persecution has rolled
on our heads from time to time

49:42.305 --> 49:46.045
like peals of thunder
because of our religion."

49:46.112 --> 49:48.851
"Because of our religion," Ron.

49:48.918 --> 49:53.327
So "arise and awaken

49:53.393 --> 49:56.132
unto your awful situation."

49:56.199 --> 49:59.439
They changed the rules on us.

49:59.506 --> 50:01.777
We're gonna put things
back in order.

50:04.148 --> 50:06.452
Robin, will you come help me
hold our brother?

50:09.125 --> 50:10.495
Was this before or after

50:10.561 --> 50:13.133
your dad confronted Dan
at the parade?

50:13.199 --> 50:14.168
It was before.

50:14.235 --> 50:16.306
He only stepped in because

50:16.373 --> 50:18.344
Ron hadn't succeeded with Dan

50:18.410 --> 50:21.917
in the way
that our father had hoped.

50:21.984 --> 50:24.221
- See, Allen claims that--

50:24.288 --> 50:26.694
that Ron had nothing to do
with Dan's ideas.

50:28.864 --> 50:32.105
But now you're telling me...

50:32.171 --> 50:35.210
that Ron followed all of you
until the end?

50:35.277 --> 50:38.718
- I didn't follow Dan
to the end.

50:40.020 --> 50:43.393
But yes,
Dan shifted Ron's mind.

50:43.460 --> 50:46.600
- Did Ron come to Dan's side
before or after this date?

50:47.869 --> 50:49.573
- Before. Well before.

50:49.640 --> 50:51.611
Ron was already with us
when Dianna sent that.

51:00.562 --> 51:02.131
If Robin is telling the truth,

51:02.198 --> 51:04.836
that letter was all about
fixing Ron.

51:04.903 --> 51:06.473
First, Dan brought Ron

51:06.541 --> 51:08.344
into alignment
with his political views.

51:08.410 --> 51:11.049
- So arise and awaken.

51:11.116 --> 51:12.519
- Then Dianna sent the letter.

51:12.585 --> 51:14.557
Yeah?
- Ron.

51:14.623 --> 51:17.428
Then Ron was denied the loan.

51:17.496 --> 51:20.467
And when their father
derailed Dan,

51:20.535 --> 51:22.404
Ron had to take over
Dan's efforts...

51:22.471 --> 51:24.275
- Arise and awake...
Ron, Ron.

51:24.342 --> 51:26.479
- To your awful situation.

51:26.547 --> 51:28.149
His father and his own wife

51:28.216 --> 51:30.588
standing squarely in Ron's way.

51:30.655 --> 51:32.893
See what Bascom says.
- Yeah. You ready?

51:32.960 --> 51:34.931
What line?
- Three.

51:37.201 --> 51:38.370
Ringing.

51:40.407 --> 51:42.078
Good afternoon!
LeConte Bascom.

51:42.144 --> 51:44.082
- Mr. Bascom,
this is Brother Pyre.

51:44.148 --> 51:46.486
Uh, we talked this morning.

51:46.554 --> 51:47.856
Oh, hi.

51:47.923 --> 51:49.292
Detective, how's your day?

51:49.358 --> 51:52.098
To be honest with you,
I--I've lost time

51:52.165 --> 51:53.902
because, uh,

51:53.969 --> 51:56.774
well, see, I worry
you may have fudged the truth

51:56.841 --> 51:59.680
with me this morning about
Ron's reaction to that letter.

51:59.747 --> 52:02.586
- Oh, dear. Uh...

52:02.653 --> 52:04.757
I remembered as best I could,
Brother Pyre.

52:04.823 --> 52:10.568
- Well, see, I don't think
Ron was upset with Dan one bit.

52:12.640 --> 52:15.377
Did you misremember that or did
the Prophet's office set limits

52:15.444 --> 52:17.448
on what you can say?

52:17.516 --> 52:18.885
'Cause they'd rather us
think of Ron

52:18.951 --> 52:23.059
as some kind of saintly victim
of Dan's extracurriculars

52:23.126 --> 52:25.832
because the last thing
they need

52:25.898 --> 52:29.673
is for Utah to find out its
treasured son had gone fundie.

52:29.740 --> 52:33.648
- In all honesty, uh,
anything I might know,

52:33.714 --> 52:35.986
I entrusted to the authority
of Bishop Low.

52:36.052 --> 52:38.658
I'm only in this bishopric.
Maybe speak with him.

52:38.725 --> 52:41.063
In all honesty,
Mr. Bascom,

52:41.129 --> 52:42.666
we can't find the dang Lows.

52:42.732 --> 52:44.636
- I'm sorry, who's this?
Bill Taba.

52:44.703 --> 52:46.807
Detective.
We haven't met yet.

52:46.874 --> 52:49.647
But we can because
if you don't tell us

52:49.713 --> 52:51.817
what you
"entrusted to Bishop Low,"

52:51.884 --> 52:55.157
then I'll cuff your ass and
bring you in for interrogation.

52:55.223 --> 52:58.998
- Uh, uh, forgive me,
I didn't, um,

52:59.064 --> 53:01.771
realize the pertinence
of what I saw until now.

53:01.837 --> 53:05.545
Now, don't you lay the blame
on her feet, all right?

53:05.612 --> 53:07.181
Ron.

53:07.247 --> 53:08.885
Thank you.

53:13.695 --> 53:15.163
- He was upset when I told him

53:15.230 --> 53:16.633
about the letter
his wife wrote.

53:26.587 --> 53:28.123
Shut your--

53:28.190 --> 53:30.996
But I--

53:31.063 --> 53:34.770
I honestly thought it was
just a domestic, Brother Pyre.

53:49.465 --> 53:51.002
- Thank you so much.
Keep me posted.

53:51.069 --> 53:52.471
The Herald and Tribune
are sending reporters.

53:52.539 --> 53:53.841
You want the national outlets?

53:53.908 --> 53:56.045
- No. We just want useful tips,
not publicity.

53:56.112 --> 53:59.185
Yeah, we got an older
model Impala station wagon,

53:59.252 --> 54:00.689
light green.

54:00.755 --> 54:01.990
Hit pause on calling more press

54:02.057 --> 54:03.427
until we fill in the boss.

54:03.494 --> 54:05.966
- Fred, do you mind holding?

54:06.032 --> 54:08.436
Chief. Welcome back.
Thanks for coming back early.

54:08.504 --> 54:10.307
Yeah.
Where are we with suspects?

54:10.374 --> 54:13.379
- We have a station wagon IDed
at a house

54:13.446 --> 54:16.319
targeted by the killers,
belongs to Ron Lafferty.

54:16.385 --> 54:17.622
- Dan Lafferty made contact

54:17.689 --> 54:20.194
with a fundamentalist sect
down south.

54:20.260 --> 54:22.833
We're putting out an APB now.
Absolutely not.

54:22.899 --> 54:24.402
Unless you're ordering pizza,
sunshine,

54:24.469 --> 54:25.939
hang up the phone.

54:26.005 --> 54:27.943
Come on. In my office.

54:28.009 --> 54:30.549
- Welcome back, Chief.

54:30.615 --> 54:32.719
- Time is of the essence.

54:32.786 --> 54:36.894
We--we can enlist the public's
help with a press conference.

54:36.961 --> 54:39.465
All right,
you two know as well as I do.

54:39.532 --> 54:41.203
Outsiders do not understand
the difference

54:41.269 --> 54:44.743
between our church and
the fundies, the polygamists.

54:44.810 --> 54:47.048
We struggle against that
perception every single day.

54:49.151 --> 54:51.389
This is my press conference.

54:51.456 --> 54:53.727
And you two will do as I say.

54:55.130 --> 54:57.368
And of course, a big thank you

54:57.435 --> 55:00.709
to our detectives,
Jeb Pyre, Bill Taba.

55:00.775 --> 55:02.879
They have been delivering
solid investigative work

55:02.946 --> 55:05.785
that is gonna bring
this troubling situation

55:05.852 --> 55:07.088
to a quick close.

55:07.154 --> 55:10.026
Detectives have a quick update
as to where we're at.

55:10.093 --> 55:11.196
Jeb?

55:11.262 --> 55:12.665
Thank you, sir.

55:14.402 --> 55:16.807
Afternoon.

55:16.874 --> 55:17.909
At this point,

55:17.976 --> 55:20.280
we're not able
to name a suspect,

55:20.347 --> 55:22.953
but we are asking the public
to help us locate a vehicle

55:23.019 --> 55:26.492
we think may be connected
to the crime.

55:26.560 --> 55:28.698
It's a green Chevrolet Impala.

55:33.508 --> 55:36.346
A as in Ada, 2-8-3.

55:36.412 --> 55:37.849
Detective,
were the murders ritualistic?

55:37.916 --> 55:39.753
Have you identified a motive?

55:39.820 --> 55:42.057
Are women with
young children being targeted?

55:46.701 --> 55:50.074
- At this point, we don't think
that the public generally

55:50.140 --> 55:52.979
needs to be afraid,
but we are a community

55:53.046 --> 55:55.785
that isn't used
to locking its doors.

55:55.852 --> 55:58.223
For the time being, we should
all err on the side of caution.

55:58.290 --> 55:59.626
Okay? Thank you.

55:59.693 --> 56:01.195
Sir,
do you suspect fundamentalism

56:01.262 --> 56:03.033
as a motive for these murders?

56:03.100 --> 56:07.709
Uh, we, uh, are aware of
a constitutional fundamentalist

56:07.776 --> 56:10.849
anti-tax group's proximity
to these events,

56:10.915 --> 56:12.886
but we've found no direct link.
Thank you.

56:12.953 --> 56:14.723
How about
Mormon fundamentalists?

56:14.790 --> 56:16.258
- That's enough, gentlemen.
Thank you so much.

56:16.325 --> 56:17.763
Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Detective Pyre.

56:17.829 --> 56:19.633
Why were you present
at a cabin raid

56:19.699 --> 56:22.305
outside of your jurisdiction?
Was that raid related?

56:22.371 --> 56:28.016
And if so, which is it?
Satanists, FLDS, or neither?

56:34.963 --> 56:36.700
It's quite a simple question.

56:46.019 --> 56:48.023
- Personally,

56:48.089 --> 56:51.195
I wouldn't rule out
fundamentalist Mormonism.

56:51.262 --> 56:52.833
Why? What have you found?

56:52.900 --> 56:54.335
Thank you, gentlemen.
That's enough.

56:54.402 --> 56:55.871
No, detective,
what have you seen--

57:12.071 --> 57:14.610
- Hey. You should, uh...

57:14.676 --> 57:15.778
- Yeah, let's get up
to Granddaddy Mountain

57:15.845 --> 57:17.214
and find Morris.
I'm ready.

57:17.281 --> 57:20.453
- I was gonna say you should
take the night off.

57:22.257 --> 57:23.827
Forgive my language...

57:26.232 --> 57:28.469
But I'm goddamn proud of you.

57:31.309 --> 57:32.912
You did the right thing.

57:34.883 --> 57:37.321
So go, get some sleep.

57:37.387 --> 57:39.091
You may well need it.

57:39.158 --> 57:40.861
- Thanks, pal.

58:19.171 --> 58:20.642
- Oh, no.

58:32.632 --> 58:35.236
I'm looking for Fern Lake.

58:37.207 --> 58:39.245
- You're lost.

58:39.312 --> 58:41.349
- Hey, hey.

59:01.489 --> 59:03.126
- Brother.

59:12.444 --> 59:14.047
- Aren't we blessed?

59:14.114 --> 59:16.620
- Good morning, Sister Dorren.
Yes, of course.

59:16.686 --> 59:19.425
- Um, my husband and I
have been praying

59:19.491 --> 59:21.964
with Stake President Ballard

59:22.030 --> 59:25.137
to see you through
your current confusion.

59:30.447 --> 59:32.552
- To conceive three children
that you will not meet

59:32.618 --> 59:35.724
till you get to heaven

59:35.791 --> 59:38.564
is a heavy burden, Sister.

59:38.631 --> 59:41.971
But they are waiting
for you in heaven.

59:42.037 --> 59:44.107
And we cannot let them down.

59:46.713 --> 59:49.652
He's given you
these two beautiful girls.

59:51.557 --> 59:55.698
Sometimes, when we wait
a long time for something,

59:55.765 --> 59:57.836
it's hard to accept
when it's finally here.

59:57.902 --> 59:59.839
But it is here.

1:00:02.277 --> 1:00:05.350
Your children have reached
the age of accountability,

1:00:05.417 --> 1:00:08.991
and it is time for your girls

1:00:09.057 --> 1:00:12.899
to be baptized
into His one true church.

1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:17.708
- We should head in.
Thank you.

1:00:17.775 --> 1:00:19.344
Thank you.
Bless you. Yes.

1:00:21.015 --> 1:00:22.685
Where are you taking me?

1:00:29.999 --> 1:00:33.206
Hello?

1:00:33.273 --> 1:00:35.244
Mister?

1:00:40.555 --> 1:00:42.224
Dear Heavenly Father...

1:00:43.928 --> 1:00:45.463
With your blessing--

1:01:04.536 --> 1:01:06.238
Bishop Low!

1:01:09.679 --> 1:01:11.315
Thank--thank you!

1:01:12.786 --> 1:01:14.355
Bishop Low!
