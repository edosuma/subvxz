17:39.516 --> 17:41.685
No rest for the wicked, Doctor.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.147
What do you think?

17:47.399 --> 17:48.358
It's very pink.

17:49.151 --> 17:53.197
I thought we agreed you'd be working
on a cure, not this temporary bullshit.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.241
My wife comes first.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.078
Besides, that's your leverage
over me, isn't it?

18:00.621 --> 18:02.831
If she dies, then you've got nothing.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.381
Well, if she dies,

18:12.132 --> 18:13.133
so do you.

18:14.676 --> 18:18.305
I'm leaving on a very important trip,
next couple of days.

18:19.848 --> 18:21.642
I expect results when we get back.

18:21.642 --> 18:25.187
Uh, with all due respect, I'm exhausted.

18:27.397 --> 18:30.859
Thirty-two people died
this morning of the Sick

18:30.859 --> 18:33.403
in what used to be called Albuquerque.

18:33.403 --> 18:34.863
I haven't slept in three days.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.907
Know what the population is there now?

18:36.907 --> 18:38.992
- I need to rest.
- A couple of hundred.

18:43.455 --> 18:44.957
I never liked Albuquerque.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.251
It's happening everywhere.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.462
This is what the new wave looks like.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.547
And that's awful.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.341
But I can't deliver
if I can't think straight!

19:01.890 --> 19:04.768
Now, while you were playing house
with a dead woman,

19:04.768 --> 19:07.771
this thing that wiped out
98% of the human race,

19:07.771 --> 19:11.233
and is mutating faster
than anything we've ever seen,

19:11.233 --> 19:12.860
is heading straight for us.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.737
It doesn't care about you
or your better half.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.282
And it certainly doesn't need to nap.

19:19.658 --> 19:20.659
Do you know why?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.828
Because it's smarter than you.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.249
You will rest when you're dead.

19:30.377 --> 19:33.172
She doesn't get another dose
until you deliver.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.257
Yeah, but... but that shot won't last.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.217
Then you better hurry, yeah?

19:37.217 --> 19:39.178
I... It will take weeks to--

19:39.178 --> 19:42.347
We'll be dead... in weeks.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.350
You have three days.

19:45.976 --> 19:47.436
I got great plans for us.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.814
Who's in charge while I'm away?

19:51.565 --> 19:53.150
I am, sir.

19:53.150 --> 19:55.110
Do it again, with gumption.

19:56.653 --> 19:57.821
[forcefully] I am, sir!

20:00.365 --> 20:01.200
You hear that?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.744
That was... Goosebumps.

20:05.746 --> 20:09.249
Now do us a little favor
and man up, both of you.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.585
[foreboding music playing]

20:14.338 --> 20:16.256
Prep the operating room, Johnny.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.385
We've got work to do.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.764
[foreboding music continues]

[kids clamoring]

20:42.908 --> 20:43.825
[jackhammering halts]

20:44.618 --> 20:46.536
Hey! Keep it down.

20:46.536 --> 20:47.788
[kids clamoring]

20:47.788 --> 20:49.122
[guard] Filthy animals.

20:49.748 --> 20:50.791
[clamoring subsides]

20:50.791 --> 20:51.875
[snarls]

20:52.960 --> 20:53.877
We hate him.

20:54.670 --> 20:57.798
Me too.
He's one of the bad men who caught me.

20:58.882 --> 21:00.092
How did they get you?

21:01.677 --> 21:02.678
[Gus sighs]

21:07.140 --> 21:08.308
I called that radio.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.395
I guess I was looking for...

21:12.646 --> 21:14.606
I don't know what I was looking for.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.858
I guess I just didn't want to be alone.

21:21.697 --> 21:22.739
What about the radio?

21:22.739 --> 21:24.032
[Earl gasps]

21:24.032 --> 21:28.036
We can call Mom. We can call Mom.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.037
Call Mom.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.455
[Earl] Call Mom.

21:30.455 --> 21:31.498
[excited clamoring]

21:33.333 --> 21:34.584
What are they saying?

21:35.669 --> 21:39.256
[translating]
If we can reach Mom on the radio...

21:39.256 --> 21:41.800
Then maybe she can
find a way to get us out.

21:41.800 --> 21:42.926
[kids murmur excitedly]

21:42.926 --> 21:44.720
But how do you know she has a radio?

21:44.720 --> 21:46.805
You've obviously never met her.

21:46.805 --> 21:48.765
[all laughing]

21:48.765 --> 21:50.392
But where do we get a radio?

21:51.560 --> 21:53.478
- Oh.
- Hmm.

21:53.478 --> 21:55.647
Radio room. Upstairs.

21:55.647 --> 21:58.191
[as Aimee]
Radio's for listening. Never for talking.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.735
But I know how to use it.

21:59.735 --> 22:01.153
I used to watch her.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.905
Yeah, but how would you get there?

22:13.790 --> 22:16.084
[brave, plucky music playing]

22:46.198 --> 22:47.199
Go.

Come on, Bobby.

23:23.777 --> 23:26.822
[guard 1 chuckling] Whoo.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.866
What the hell do we do with these?

23:29.866 --> 23:32.327
[guard 2] Boss man said take them out,
we take them out.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.621
[guard 1] Hey, target practice?

23:35.664 --> 23:37.499
[guard 2] Well, we could.

23:37.499 --> 23:41.211
Or... we can throw them off a building
and watch them explode.

23:41.211 --> 23:45.549
[guard 1] See, that's why
you got promoted, man. You got ideas.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.634

- [Wendy] Go!
- [Gus] Give me the keys.

24:02.983 --> 24:03.984
[Gus] Come on!

24:03.984 --> 24:05.735
- Move!
- You move!

24:05.735 --> 24:07.320
- Help Maya.
- Come on.

24:08.572 --> 24:10.198
- [excited clamoring]
- Shh!

24:11.867 --> 24:12.951
Come on.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.620
- Hurry.
- [Earl] Try the mirror.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.747
[Gus] You're really close. Really close.

24:18.707 --> 24:20.250
[clamoring continues]

24:20.250 --> 24:21.209
[Gus] You got this.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.128
- Here, I'll help.
- Come on.

24:25.046 --> 24:27.007

Hey, you got the keys?

24:36.266 --> 24:37.476
[guard 2] Thought you had them.

24:42.522 --> 24:43.982
Johnny probably has them.

24:43.982 --> 24:47.152
That hippie guy?
How's that dude in charge of anything?

24:47.152 --> 24:50.030
- You know who that hippie guy is, right?
- No, who?

24:50.030 --> 24:52.073
One scary dude.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.659
They're gone, Wendy. Go.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.411
Wendy. Go, now.

24:56.995 --> 25:00.081
- But what if they come back?
- It's okay. You got this.

25:00.081 --> 25:00.999
What if I can't?

25:00.999 --> 25:03.376
Look what they did to us the last time.

25:03.376 --> 25:05.462
You didn't have me last time, okay?

25:05.462 --> 25:06.713
[gentle music playing]

25:06.713 --> 25:09.591
I'll go with you. Just tell me what to do.

Okay.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.929

You did it.

[indistinct radio chatter]

- Are you ready?
- I was born ready.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.004
Mom, we're alive.

27:11.004 --> 27:13.423
We're in the pump house
under the elephant pen.

27:13.423 --> 27:14.466
And they took Roy.

Was that...

Roy's not coming back, guys.

That's right. 'Cause Roy escaped.

29:32.520 --> 29:35.982
Yeah, he snuck out after they took him.

It's amazing what a lack of people can do.

30:50.473 --> 30:53.768
Well, we all agreed on a time.
Is Zhang running late?

31:03.111 --> 31:04.654
She's not coming, is she?

31:05.238 --> 31:07.198
- She sends her regards.
- [Abbot grouses]

[Dutch] They're both very sorry.

They sent me to address
any outstanding issues you may have.

You all agreed to listen to my proposal.

we are not interested.

I see.

What if we don't have any more time?

Yeah. Where you see fear,
I see possibility.

what we're working on,

[Bobby] Aww.

33:37.890 --> 33:40.143
Why did you tell them that about Roy?

33:40.143 --> 33:41.310
We had to.

33:42.812 --> 33:45.481
Sometimes it's okay
to bend the truth a little.

33:45.481 --> 33:47.150
- If it helps--
- Says who?

33:47.734 --> 33:49.527
My mom never lied to us.

33:50.611 --> 33:52.864
Well, what were you gonna tell them?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.032
The truth.

If we get taken away, we don't come back.

Roy is not your fault.
