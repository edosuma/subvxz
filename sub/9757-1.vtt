00:15.412 --> 00:17.004
I am a prosecutor.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.650
I'm a part of the business of accusing...

00:21.572 --> 00:22.766
...judging...

00:23.292 --> 00:24.645
...and punishing.

00:25.932 --> 00:28.241
I explore the evidence of a crime...

00:29.172 --> 00:31.402
...and determine who is charged...

00:32.572 --> 00:34.528
...who is brought to this room...

00:34.612 --> 00:36.728
...to be tried before his peers.

00:38.812 --> 00:41.201
I present my evidence to thejury...

00:42.172 --> 00:44.208
...and they deliberate upon it.

00:45.012 --> 00:47.765
They must determine
what really happened.

00:50.172 --> 00:51.730
If they cannot...

00:52.692 --> 00:57.004
...we won't know if the accused deserves
to be freed or to be punished.

00:58.572 --> 01:00.688
If they cannot find the truth...

01:01.652 --> 01:03.722
...what is our hope ofjustice?

02:35.212 --> 02:36.611
Where's Nat?

02:37.212 --> 02:38.930
Burying a goldfish.

02:39.532 --> 02:43.127
That he forgot to feed.
Kid's gotta learn responsibility.

02:43.532 --> 02:44.851
He's nine.

02:45.092 --> 02:47.925
When you were nine,
you fed the animals on the block...

02:48.012 --> 02:50.128
...and made dinner,
did everyone's homework...

02:50.212 --> 02:52.601
...and, in your spare time,
you practiced law.

02:52.692 --> 02:55.331
I didn't practice law until I was ten.

02:56.052 --> 02:57.405
Listen to this.

02:57.652 --> 03:01.167
"ln their first face-to-face debate,
Nico Della Guardia...

03:01.532 --> 03:03.887
"...appeared to throw
Raymond Horgan off stride...

03:03.972 --> 03:06.805
"...with an opening swipe
at the prosecuting attorney's...

03:06.892 --> 03:10.805
"...twelve-year tenure as
'an uninterrupted retreat from reality...

03:11.212 --> 03:15.808
"'...and slow-motion surrender to thugs,
punks and hand-wringing liberals."'

03:16.172 --> 03:17.924
The guy's unbelievable.

03:18.412 --> 03:22.405
I'm finally starting to get used to that rug
on Della Guardia's head.

03:23.052 --> 03:25.043
Don't eat standing up. Sit down.

03:25.132 --> 03:28.169
Food goes down easier.
It has the help of gravity.

03:28.412 --> 03:29.640
Oh, God.

03:30.732 --> 03:32.450
Yet another lawyer.

03:40.172 --> 03:43.209
I won't be home till late.
I got a game after school.

03:45.812 --> 03:48.565
Like his father, he doesn't come home
till he has to.

03:48.652 --> 03:51.689
If Raymond loses this election,
I could be home a lot.

04:32.292 --> 04:34.567
Rick, I looked this over last night.

04:35.332 --> 04:36.651
Top count, max.

04:36.732 --> 04:38.324
It's a first offense!

04:38.572 --> 04:41.040
No plea to anything
but the A-1 felony. Period.

04:41.132 --> 04:42.360
On all of them?

04:42.492 --> 04:43.607
All of them.

04:43.692 --> 04:46.001
And no promises on the sentence.

04:48.732 --> 04:50.563
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

04:53.132 --> 04:54.485
This is for you.

04:55.852 --> 04:57.922
Someone put it under the door last night.

04:58.012 --> 04:59.843
I found it when I came in.

05:03.732 --> 05:06.007
Mr. Big Cheese wants to see you now.

05:06.092 --> 05:07.366
I'll be right along.

05:07.452 --> 05:09.170
He said "now," now.

05:31.812 --> 05:33.131
What's wrong?

05:34.212 --> 05:36.646
Carolyn Polhemus was murdered last night.

05:37.932 --> 05:40.002
Her cleaning lady found the body
this morning.

05:40.092 --> 05:42.811
Some creep got into her place
and strangled her.

05:42.892 --> 05:45.884
It looks like she was raped.
He tied her up...

05:46.532 --> 05:49.842
...he beat her with some instrument
and strangled her.

05:50.092 --> 05:52.606
No weapon. No sign of forced entry.

05:54.012 --> 05:56.731
Unless you want me here,
I'm supposed to meet the coroner.

05:56.812 --> 05:59.326
That's all right. Go on, get out of here.

06:00.132 --> 06:01.804
I can hear Della Guardia now.

06:01.892 --> 06:06.249
"lf Raymond Horgan can't protect his own
attorneys, how can he protect citizens?"

06:07.052 --> 06:10.089
Tommy Molto's secretary said
he wasn't coming in today.

06:10.892 --> 06:14.851
Some fucking Acting Head of Homicide
he turned out to be, the little creep.

06:14.932 --> 06:17.810
I should have fired him when we fired Nico.

06:18.412 --> 06:20.323
If I had balls, I'd do it now.

06:21.452 --> 06:23.920
I want you to handle this case personally.

06:24.012 --> 06:25.923
I will assign it to somebody.

06:26.012 --> 06:27.968
Who will you assign it to? Homicide?

06:28.052 --> 06:30.122
Tommy Molto? For Christ's sake!

06:31.252 --> 06:34.642
Della Guardia would love that.
Molto would tip him off on everything.

06:34.732 --> 06:39.203
They're so close you can see Molto's nose
sticking out of Nico's bellybutton.

06:43.572 --> 06:44.846
Listen to me.

06:47.212 --> 06:48.531
What a waste.

06:49.932 --> 06:52.321
Beautiful, sexy gal. Hell of a lawyer.

06:54.492 --> 06:56.960
That's her ending. That's her au revoir.

06:58.092 --> 06:59.969
The first thing we got to think about...

07:00.052 --> 07:03.328
...is what the public thinks
in the middle of an election.

07:07.972 --> 07:10.486
Take charge of this one for me, okay?

07:11.252 --> 07:13.129
If you care about my health.

07:14.412 --> 07:16.801
You're the only around here I can trust.

07:18.412 --> 07:22.769
Greer's a good investigator, but I'd prefer
someone I'm used to working with.

07:23.052 --> 07:24.280
Lipranzer.

07:24.452 --> 07:25.851
Whatever you want.

07:26.932 --> 07:28.809
Just catch me a bad guy.

08:42.532 --> 08:43.965
So, I'm here.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.206
What the hell was she doing with a B file?

08:49.692 --> 08:53.128
Bribery of elected officials.
The case number is on her computer.

08:53.212 --> 08:56.284
But the case itself isn't among
the papers in her files.

08:56.452 --> 08:58.283
Why? Did she take it home? What?

08:58.372 --> 08:59.851
Maybe it was taken?

09:00.012 --> 09:01.843
Check the apartment.
What do you got here?

09:01.932 --> 09:03.888
Bunch of pictures of a dead lady.

09:03.972 --> 09:05.803
-No weapon found, yet?
-Nada.

09:05.972 --> 09:07.325
It's a weird one.

09:07.412 --> 09:10.245
She was strangled by the ropes
but by the way he tied her...

09:10.332 --> 09:13.051
...it's like he put himself
between her legs and pumped...

09:13.132 --> 09:17.489
...so they tightened up like he was trying
to let his weight strangle her.

09:17.692 --> 09:19.808
Like he was trying to fuck her to death.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.405
Look at the next one.

09:27.892 --> 09:32.329
Check the computer for sex offenders
and cross match on Carolyn's name...

09:32.852 --> 09:34.922
...or this business with the ropes.

09:36.772 --> 09:39.889
Find out which of the creeps she put away
is out on parole.

09:39.972 --> 09:44.443
I never did understand why you put her
in charge of rape and all that sicko shit.

09:45.412 --> 09:47.801
She wanted it. And she was good.

09:48.452 --> 09:50.204
Yeah, too good, maybe.

09:51.332 --> 09:53.084
I'm not grabbing this, yet.

09:54.532 --> 09:55.681
You worked with this broad.

09:55.772 --> 09:59.287
She wouldn't leave her fucking door
and windows wide open.

09:59.372 --> 10:03.411
She was drinking with him. She gave him
a glass of beer, like she was entertaining.

10:03.492 --> 10:05.323
-Fingerprints on the glass?
-Yeah.

10:05.412 --> 10:07.243
Greer sent it down to the lab.

10:07.332 --> 10:11.644
You mean somebody she let in opened
the windows so it looked like a break-in?

10:11.972 --> 10:15.806
She wasn't going to let some sex maniac
she sent to jail in for a beer.

10:17.772 --> 10:20.206
On the other hand, we're talking Carolyn.

10:21.372 --> 10:22.327
Mac...

10:22.732 --> 10:26.202
...tell me what Carolyn Polhemus
was doing with a bribery file.

10:27.092 --> 10:30.164
I had no idea Carolyn was interested
in crimes above the waist.

10:30.252 --> 10:33.722
It's on her computer,
but not on mine or the department's.

10:33.892 --> 10:35.405
That makes no sense.

10:35.932 --> 10:37.604
Why don't you ask Raymond?

10:38.332 --> 10:40.004
Ready for something else?

10:41.332 --> 10:42.765
Molto's left.

10:43.292 --> 10:46.841
His secretary came back from lunch
and found his desk cleaned out.

11:37.812 --> 11:39.086
Exercise?

11:40.492 --> 11:41.925
Masturbation.

11:43.252 --> 11:45.322
The refuge of the lonely housewife.

11:47.692 --> 11:50.331
Missed the 8:35. I tried to call,
but you weren't here.

11:50.412 --> 11:53.484
Nat had dinner at Josh's,
and I was at the university.

11:53.612 --> 11:56.684
I tried to get in a little extra time
on the mainframe.

11:57.732 --> 11:59.085
Get anything done?

12:01.452 --> 12:02.521
Who am I kidding?

12:02.612 --> 12:05.649
Still working on my dissertation at my age.
It's ridiculous.

12:05.732 --> 12:08.292
You were the best mathematician
in your class.

12:08.772 --> 12:11.650
Second best just made
full professor at MIT.

12:12.892 --> 12:14.120
All I've made are beds.

12:14.212 --> 12:16.248
And now, the Channel Six local news.

12:16.332 --> 12:20.962
Carolyn Polhemus, assistant prosecuting
attorney in Raymond Horgan's office...

12:21.252 --> 12:24.005
...was found brutally murdered
in her Southside apartment.

12:24.092 --> 12:27.880
Police are about to release a statement
about the circumstances of her death....

12:27.972 --> 12:29.041
You hear?

12:29.132 --> 12:32.442
Eugenia was thrilled to be messenger
of bad tidings.

12:34.572 --> 12:35.971
Yeah, I'll bet.

12:37.732 --> 12:40.326
From top to bottom
we are riddled with cruelty.

12:40.532 --> 12:42.727
We must expose and punish it...

12:42.892 --> 12:46.805
...especially when inflicted
upon the impotent and the ignored.

12:48.652 --> 12:50.927
You sound like a woman with a mission.

12:51.652 --> 12:52.641
I am.

12:53.892 --> 12:55.803
The murder of Ms. Polhemus--

12:57.892 --> 12:59.325
You have a suspect?

12:59.652 --> 13:01.404
We have diddly-shit.

13:06.052 --> 13:10.250
So Dan Lipranzer and Rusty Sabich
will work night and day for two weeks...

13:10.372 --> 13:13.170
...to catch Raymond a killer.
That's the strategy.

13:14.132 --> 13:16.441
You're in charge of this investigation?

13:17.612 --> 13:19.842
Raymond insisted I take it on.

13:21.772 --> 13:26.209
With 1 50 lawyers, they couldn't find one
who didn't fuck her to put in charge?

13:29.412 --> 13:30.891
Did you tell Raymond?

13:31.492 --> 13:34.450
This is a conflict of interest.
Is that professional?

13:37.012 --> 13:39.321
Barbara, I'm Raymond's chief deputy.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.563
You are so predictable.

13:43.572 --> 13:46.040
It's your way of reliving the whole thing.

13:46.292 --> 13:48.931
She's dead and you're still obsessing.

14:00.132 --> 14:01.087
Rusty.

14:02.052 --> 14:03.041
Nico.

14:03.572 --> 14:05.164
She was just....

14:06.212 --> 14:08.601
-Splendid.
-That's it. Very good.

14:09.492 --> 14:12.211
Raymond's pressing hard
on that case, I imagine.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.320
Raymond presses hard on every case, Nico.

14:15.572 --> 14:18.564
You know who would've been hard
to beat? You.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.722
You would've been tough. Very tough.

14:22.252 --> 14:25.244
You are really something.
Where's Tommy Molto?

14:25.892 --> 14:26.688
Molto?

14:26.772 --> 14:29.684
I thought he'd come to the funeral
of his favorite colleague.

14:29.772 --> 14:31.922
You must really have him scrambling.

14:36.892 --> 14:38.041
Judge.

14:43.452 --> 14:45.044
Who's that with Raymond?

14:45.172 --> 14:47.402
I'm told that's her ex-husband.

14:49.652 --> 14:51.404
I didn't know she had one.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.444
Teaches college someplace.

14:55.732 --> 14:57.802
Carolyn Polhemus worked for me.

14:59.092 --> 15:00.241
I hired her...

15:00.572 --> 15:02.403
...over the objections of...

15:02.932 --> 15:06.561
...many of our prosecutors
who felt shejust didn't have the stuff.

15:07.772 --> 15:10.127
I see those prosecutors here today...

15:11.732 --> 15:13.962
...along with thejudges she defied...

15:15.092 --> 15:17.652
...and the defense attorneys she defeated.

15:19.892 --> 15:21.484
Why are they all here?

15:23.252 --> 15:26.449
They're here because Carolyn Polhemus
stood for something.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.883
She stood forjustice.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.728
The Prosecutor's Office,
under my leadership...

15:48.812 --> 15:50.928
...has a conviction rate of over 91 percent.

15:51.012 --> 15:52.968
Mr. Della Guardia, or...

15:53.612 --> 15:57.491
...as he is known to those of us
who have had to work with him, "Delay"--

15:57.812 --> 15:59.609
There's food here for 1 00 people.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.091
A lot of no-shows.

16:01.972 --> 16:03.405
They smell a loser.

16:04.612 --> 16:07.649
-Good speech.
-What the hell is happening with Carolyn?

16:08.372 --> 16:09.771
Everything's in the works.

16:09.852 --> 16:13.447
I reassigned her cases, and this afternoon
I gotta deal with Molto's stuff.

16:13.532 --> 16:15.602
What's with this reassignment shit?

16:15.692 --> 16:17.125
Goddamn it, Rusty!

16:17.332 --> 16:20.324
I told you to give this investigation
top priority.

16:21.532 --> 16:25.081
Nico is eating me alive with this thing.
The election is in ten days.

16:25.172 --> 16:27.891
If you don't find Carolyn's killer,
we are both history.

16:27.972 --> 16:31.089
Turn all of that administrative bullshit
to Mac.

16:31.452 --> 16:33.363
Mac has more than she can handle.

16:33.452 --> 16:36.489
And let me remind you,
we lost two key PA's in one day.

16:36.692 --> 16:40.002
You only have time for the election.
I've got to run the office.

16:40.092 --> 16:43.084
Fuck the office!
Don't you see what's happening?

16:43.212 --> 16:46.409
If you don't find me a killer,
there is no fucking office!

16:47.892 --> 16:50.452
I want you right on top
of Carolyn's case, understand?

16:50.532 --> 16:54.684
Run out every ground ball and do it
in an orderly goddamned fashion!

16:56.732 --> 16:59.121
Start acting like a fucking professional!

16:59.252 --> 17:01.607
The campaign is a total disaster.

17:02.092 --> 17:05.607
Haven't taken a poll in two weeks.
We don't know where the hell we are.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.729
You're ten minutes late
for the bar meeting on criminal procedure.

17:08.811 --> 17:11.201
Call them and tell them I'm on my way.

17:16.172 --> 17:18.560
Did you assign a bribery case to Carolyn?

17:18.972 --> 17:20.564
There's a file missing.

17:21.051 --> 17:24.328
Loretta, find my driver.
Tell him to be ready to leave.

17:24.452 --> 17:27.364
She had a case on her computer
we can't account for.

17:27.692 --> 17:29.762
It was logged in as a B file.

17:32.652 --> 17:34.882
Nobody knows where it came from.

17:37.012 --> 17:38.240
Nobody knows where it went.

17:38.332 --> 17:41.483
Where the hell is my speech?
It was right here on my desk.

17:41.572 --> 17:42.891
Cody has it.

17:43.132 --> 17:45.043
You're giving me a runaround.

17:46.092 --> 17:49.129
Cody, pull the car around.
I'll meet you down in front.

17:49.932 --> 17:52.400
Give me a straight answer, will you, Boss?

18:02.652 --> 18:05.928
There's the B file, Tiger.
Read it, and we'll talk.

18:09.132 --> 18:10.167
"Dear Mr. Horgan.

18:10.252 --> 18:14.086
"This is about a deputy prosecuting
attorney who is taking bribes.

18:14.212 --> 18:17.409
"Five years ago,
a person I'll call 'Noel' got arrested.

18:17.492 --> 18:20.165
"l gave him $1 ,500 to pay somebody off.

18:21.292 --> 18:24.967
"We went out to North Branch.
A secretary who seemed to know Noel...

18:25.092 --> 18:29.768
"...took him into the PA's office, where
a man he could not see talked behind him.

18:30.412 --> 18:34.246
"Ten days later, Noel went to court
and a lawyer from the PA's office...

18:34.372 --> 18:37.409
"...told the judge that
the case was dismissed.

18:37.692 --> 18:40.490
"l can't remember the lawyer's name.
I hope you get him.

18:40.572 --> 18:43.609
"l hope you get Noel, too.
He has let me down."

18:44.252 --> 18:46.004
-Unsigned.
-Unsigned.

18:47.052 --> 18:48.565
Five years ago.

18:48.852 --> 18:50.763
That guy must write real slow.

18:51.372 --> 18:53.090
"Noel equals Leon."

18:54.572 --> 18:56.483
This is Carolyn's handwriting.

18:56.572 --> 18:59.530
Looks like she went to North Branch
to see Kenneally.

19:08.452 --> 19:10.682
You'll love what I got from Painless.

19:14.972 --> 19:17.088
There's this guy's semen
inside her vagina...

19:17.172 --> 19:18.764
...but there's nothing outside.

19:18.852 --> 19:22.686
Painless figures she didn't spend
much time on her feet after sex.

19:22.972 --> 19:25.691
He says, normally,
he'd see the guy's little thingies...

19:25.772 --> 19:29.003
...swimming upstream in the womb,
when he looked under the microscope.

19:29.092 --> 19:31.481
Instead, this guy's was all dead.

19:32.252 --> 19:34.049
Nothing went nowhere.

19:34.172 --> 19:36.242
So Painless figures he's sterile.

19:36.852 --> 19:38.604
He's got blood type A.

19:39.772 --> 19:41.091
My very own.

19:41.492 --> 19:44.131
I thought of that. But you got a kid.

19:46.692 --> 19:47.966
Anything from hair or fiber?

19:48.052 --> 19:49.963
No hair or skin fragments under her nails.

19:50.052 --> 19:51.849
Carolyn would've fought back.

19:51.932 --> 19:54.446
Maybe she was playing sex games
with the wrong guy.

19:54.532 --> 19:57.808
The rope is K-Mart, Sears, Walgreen's.
You name it.

19:58.012 --> 20:01.561
They found carpet fibers
from some other location. Zorak V.

20:01.732 --> 20:03.768
It's only the biggest seller.

20:05.052 --> 20:07.646
You call the Fingerprint Lab
on the bar glass?

20:08.772 --> 20:09.921
Oh, I forgot.

20:10.012 --> 20:12.321
You are a class-A fuck-up, you know?

20:12.412 --> 20:14.687
They ain't going to expedite it for me.

20:14.772 --> 20:17.969
I got the phone company printout
on her apartment.

20:20.572 --> 20:25.088
I notice that one of the numbers
that comes up is yours a number of times.

20:25.372 --> 20:27.328
At the office.
We were working cases together.

20:27.412 --> 20:29.243
No, she's calling your home.

20:32.772 --> 20:34.808
She never called me at home.

20:44.452 --> 20:46.090
I made these calls...

20:46.732 --> 20:49.087
...to Barbara from Carolyn's apartment.

20:50.452 --> 20:51.931
"Late again, kid."

20:53.012 --> 20:55.810
"This trial's a bitch.
I'll catch dinner in town."

21:01.092 --> 21:03.162
I'd just as soon you'd let it go.

21:05.412 --> 21:09.405
If Barbara sees a phone company
subpoena, now, she'll bust a gut.

21:13.732 --> 21:16.451
Under the circumstances,
if you don't mind...

21:17.412 --> 21:18.925
...l'd appreciate it.

21:22.372 --> 21:23.805
I gave Barbara...

21:26.852 --> 21:28.285
...enough pain.

21:32.372 --> 21:34.203
Polhemus was bad news.

21:35.812 --> 21:38.929
Know what they're calling you
and your partner downtown?

21:39.012 --> 21:39.967
Spare me.

21:40.052 --> 21:41.849
"Mission lmpossible."

21:42.212 --> 21:44.885
Guerasch, bring that shit in my office.

21:45.652 --> 21:49.486
So you're figuring what? The guy
she was having cocktails with did her?

21:49.572 --> 21:53.406
I figure it was somebody who knew
what he wanted it to look like.

21:53.532 --> 21:55.568
Cop. PA. A private dick.

21:56.172 --> 21:59.209
Remember that lady PA
who was here four months ago?

21:59.332 --> 22:00.765
Yeah, nice set of lungs.

22:00.852 --> 22:03.889
This kid's gonna make a copper.
Never forgets a bra size.

22:03.972 --> 22:05.883
He wants to know
what she was looking for.

22:05.972 --> 22:08.770
She was looking for someone
by the name of Noel.

22:11.092 --> 22:13.208
It took me a week to find this crap.

22:13.292 --> 22:16.045
Five years back,
they booked 1 50 a day then.

22:16.212 --> 22:17.486
Public indecency.

22:17.572 --> 22:19.802
They were cleaning out the faggots.

22:19.892 --> 22:22.884
Back when Raymond got some balls
for a day and a half.

22:24.292 --> 22:26.362
-She find anything?
-I don't know.

22:26.532 --> 22:30.047
When I gave these files to her,
they were in nice order.

22:30.412 --> 22:32.562
The bitch just trashed them.

22:32.772 --> 22:35.525
She never gave a shit
about anybody else's work.

22:35.732 --> 22:37.643
One's completely missing. Look.

22:37.732 --> 22:40.121
See right here? It skips a number.

22:41.412 --> 22:43.084
Tommy Molto been looking at these?

22:43.172 --> 22:45.208
What does Molto have to do with this?

22:45.292 --> 22:47.522
Would there still be a court file
on this case?

22:47.612 --> 22:51.002
That far back, it'd have to be in storage
on microfilm by now.

22:56.212 --> 22:58.521
You don't want to say
what this is about, maybe?

22:58.612 --> 23:00.284
Gee, Lionel, I can't.

23:01.092 --> 23:03.242
She used to ask about you, you know.

23:03.332 --> 23:06.927
Five, six years ago when she worked
out here as a probation officer.

23:07.012 --> 23:09.526
-Five years ago I didn't know her.
-Sure you did.

23:09.612 --> 23:11.887
The night you brought the Night Saints in.

23:11.972 --> 23:14.406
You were hot stuff. A regular fucking hero.

23:14.492 --> 23:16.722
Breaking the meanest guy
this side of Watts.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.724
There was a lot of talk
you'd end up in Horgan's job.

23:19.812 --> 23:22.042
She wanted to know what you were like.

23:22.532 --> 23:24.762
I told her you didn't fuck around.

23:26.612 --> 23:28.125
Dad, look who's here.

23:29.892 --> 23:32.565
-How are you?
-Good. Mom's in a good mood.

23:32.652 --> 23:34.449
How'd you know I'd be on this ferry?

23:34.532 --> 23:36.011
Took a chance.

23:37.652 --> 23:39.005
How was your day?

23:39.652 --> 23:43.008
Well, I figured out today,
it's ten years this week...

23:43.492 --> 23:45.881
...that I'm working on my dissertation.

23:46.292 --> 23:49.250
I thought we'd celebrate.
Going to take us to dinner?

23:51.172 --> 23:53.481
Why don't you just give up
on that dissertation?

23:53.572 --> 23:55.290
It makes you miserable.

23:55.812 --> 23:57.803
Your mom's not a giver-upper.

23:58.692 --> 23:59.886
Maybe that's her problem.

23:59.972 --> 24:02.202
I sure wouldn't do math unless I had to.

24:02.292 --> 24:04.522
You got my genes in the math department.

24:04.612 --> 24:07.172
If not for your mom,
I'd still be taking algebra.

24:07.252 --> 24:09.163
I had to be good at something.

24:09.412 --> 24:11.243
You were good at everything.

24:11.972 --> 24:13.166
School.

24:14.812 --> 24:16.530
Did you ever cheat?

24:16.892 --> 24:18.883
Like borrow someone else's homework?

24:18.972 --> 24:21.281
Copy it and pretend it was mine?

24:23.292 --> 24:26.967
Why do I have the feeling that question
has some personal relevance?

24:27.252 --> 24:28.685
I didn't say I did.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.485
It's all right, kid.

24:33.012 --> 24:35.003
It's good to see you guys happy.

24:42.332 --> 24:43.287
Pretty.

24:44.692 --> 24:45.807
It's new.

24:47.292 --> 24:48.725
It's very pretty.

25:40.092 --> 25:42.083
Mr. Polhemus? I'm Rusty Sabich.

25:43.612 --> 25:47.048
Seems so strange to be talking about her
after all these years.

25:47.892 --> 25:50.326
You hadn't had much contact
with her, then?

25:50.492 --> 25:52.210
None since she left.

25:53.212 --> 25:54.565
What about her family?

25:54.652 --> 25:57.120
I have no idea where she came from.

25:57.532 --> 26:01.810
She lied her way into the university.
Made up some kind of background.

26:03.452 --> 26:05.522
She was very good at playing roles.

26:08.012 --> 26:10.367
When she left me, I lost all pride.

26:10.852 --> 26:12.570
I begged her not to leave.

26:13.372 --> 26:16.682
The last time she looked at me,
it was with disgust.

26:16.852 --> 26:20.401
Disgust that somebody she'd looked up to
could be so weak.

26:21.212 --> 26:25.205
At that moment, I had the most
desperate wish that she were dead.

26:28.412 --> 26:32.405
Maybe she made a man feel like that
who actually acted on his fantasy.

26:34.292 --> 26:37.807
Would you like to see what she looked like
at that time?

26:40.732 --> 26:42.006
Yes, I would.

26:44.252 --> 26:47.050
They were taken at about the time
we were married.

27:01.692 --> 27:03.489
This isn't just work?

27:06.092 --> 27:07.047
No.

27:26.812 --> 27:30.964
On the Polhemus thing, what the fuck
is happening to the fingerprints report?

27:31.292 --> 27:35.126
Don't give me that computer crap!
You know I don't understand that shit.

27:35.692 --> 27:38.411
They want to know how big a field
you want it run against?

27:38.492 --> 27:40.005
We could do convicted felons...

27:40.092 --> 27:43.050
...anybody ever fingerprinted,
county employees, etc.

27:43.212 --> 27:46.409
Just do felons.
We'll do the rest if we need them.

27:46.732 --> 27:48.927
Do them all. I may never get back on.

27:49.012 --> 27:50.968
Do everybody. How soon?

27:52.252 --> 27:53.765
What the fuck takes a week?

27:53.852 --> 27:56.241
The man has the biggest murder case
in the city...

27:56.332 --> 27:58.323
...and he has to kiss your ring?

27:59.132 --> 28:00.724
I know. I know.

28:02.492 --> 28:05.370
We don't have jurisdiction
over the computer.

28:07.892 --> 28:11.202
-A week. Probably ten days.
-I need them yesterday.

28:11.692 --> 28:14.604
I'll push, but I don't think
you'll see them any sooner.

28:14.692 --> 28:18.207
Have your copper get the glass back
from Evidence and down to the lab...

28:18.292 --> 28:20.328
...in case they need it for anything.

28:22.812 --> 28:24.325
Ah, Mr. Sabich.

28:25.092 --> 28:26.889
Real important stuff.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.481
We got the chief deputy with us.

28:29.932 --> 28:32.241
Lipranzer and I were wondering,
on your report...

28:32.332 --> 28:36.644
...are you indicating the guy bashed her
after she was strangled by the ropes?

28:36.812 --> 28:38.131
Read the fucking report.

28:38.212 --> 28:39.361
This report?

28:39.492 --> 28:42.450
No, not that report. My report.
The autopsy.

28:46.052 --> 28:48.043
See anything with bruises on the wrists...

28:48.132 --> 28:51.010
...bruises on the ankles,
bruises on the knees?

28:51.092 --> 28:53.925
Are you saying she was raped
and then tied up?

28:54.052 --> 28:55.770
Tied up last, yeah.

28:56.132 --> 28:58.692
She already died
from multiple head injuries.

28:59.092 --> 29:01.128
Rape? Now I'm thinking...

29:02.052 --> 29:02.928
...no.

29:03.292 --> 29:04.088
Why?

29:05.052 --> 29:06.485
Read the fucking report.

29:06.572 --> 29:07.925
-This report?
-No.

29:09.052 --> 29:10.883
This report? The chemist's report?

29:10.972 --> 29:12.724
Yeah, the chemist's report.

29:13.052 --> 29:16.567
She had a two percent solution
of nonoxynol-9 in her vagina.

29:16.732 --> 29:20.566
A spermicide used with a diaphragm.
That's why his sperms were dead.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.604
Diaphragm? You missed a diaphragm
in the autopsy?

29:24.252 --> 29:27.722
No. You've been to autopsies.
You slice her wide open.

29:28.012 --> 29:30.048
No diaphragm in that lady.

29:30.332 --> 29:31.845
What happened to it?

29:32.412 --> 29:33.765
Somebody took it.

29:35.932 --> 29:37.729
I think it's a setup.

29:38.252 --> 29:39.605
This man...

29:39.932 --> 29:42.730
...is her lover. He comes over.
They have drinks.

29:43.132 --> 29:46.488
This lady has intercourse with him.
Real nice. Okay?

29:47.132 --> 29:50.329
But he's an angry guy.
Picks up something, kills her.

29:50.452 --> 29:52.647
Tries to make it look like rape.

29:52.772 --> 29:54.046
Ties her up.

29:54.172 --> 29:55.924
Pulls out the diaphragm.

29:56.692 --> 29:58.444
That's what I think.

30:00.892 --> 30:02.723
What does Tommy Molto think?

30:05.452 --> 30:09.604
You got his phone number right there.
Want to jot it down in case you need it?

30:10.452 --> 30:11.851
Next time you talk to him...

30:11.932 --> 30:13.809
...tell him to call me so I can find out...

30:13.892 --> 30:16.770
...what's going on
in my own fucking investigation.

30:18.012 --> 30:19.206
Painless...

30:19.532 --> 30:22.046
...you tell Molto, and you tell Nico, too...

30:22.132 --> 30:24.692
...that this is cheap, cheap politics.

30:24.852 --> 30:26.888
Cheap Police Department bullshit.

30:27.092 --> 30:31.085
God better help them and help you, too.
I can't make a case for tampering.

30:31.732 --> 30:36.010
Our poll shows Della Guardia's leading
Horgan by four percent. Eight days left.

30:36.852 --> 30:38.490
At least it's made somebody happy.

30:38.572 --> 30:40.403
I don't want to see you out of here.

30:40.492 --> 30:42.289
Come on, pal. We're old news.

30:42.372 --> 30:46.411
I'd miss you. Who else here can talk
morality and ethics and not break me up?

30:46.492 --> 30:51.043
Voters smell an exhausted man who's lost
sight of all the important issues.

30:51.412 --> 30:52.845
Issues? Bullshit.

30:53.012 --> 30:56.209
The only issue is Raymond Horgan
has respect for the law...

30:56.372 --> 31:00.445
...and Nico Della Guardia will fuck the law
for politics. That's the issue.

31:03.572 --> 31:04.607
Rusty....

31:05.492 --> 31:07.642
Have you ever been to an lrish wake?

31:09.252 --> 31:11.561
Come on over and pull up a glass.

31:12.532 --> 31:15.410
Know what Della Guardia
is going to find out?

31:15.772 --> 31:17.808
You run for office because...

31:18.612 --> 31:21.922
...you think you can make people do things,
make things better.

31:22.012 --> 31:23.206
But you can't.

31:23.372 --> 31:24.600
Nobody can.

31:25.612 --> 31:29.048
You get a few potholes filled,
keep the lid on the best way you can.

31:29.132 --> 31:30.406
But in the end...

31:30.492 --> 31:33.609
...all you can do is try to hang on
to the fucking job.

31:37.652 --> 31:40.166
I never used to drink when I started here.

31:40.492 --> 31:43.689
Then, you still believed
you could make a difference.

31:46.132 --> 31:48.202
Funny, part of me still does.

31:50.612 --> 31:52.648
A guy as tough as you are...

31:53.292 --> 31:56.364
...you're still hanging on
to the shreds of your ideals.

31:56.892 --> 31:58.769
The shreds are all I got.

32:00.852 --> 32:02.604
You're a good man, Rusty.

32:05.012 --> 32:06.286
God bless you.

32:10.132 --> 32:12.043
So, tell me, who's our bad guy?

32:13.332 --> 32:16.051
It could be a boyfriend.
Some guy she picked up.

32:18.132 --> 32:21.920
Whoever it is knew enough about her
to know what to make it look like.

32:22.292 --> 32:24.601
Could be a law-enforcement type.

32:27.132 --> 32:28.121
Jesus.

32:28.212 --> 32:29.486
One of us.

32:40.172 --> 32:42.083
You and Carolyn have a thing?

32:42.452 --> 32:46.206
Don't beat around the bush.
Just come right out and ask the question.

32:49.492 --> 32:53.565
I'll say that the decedent and I
were both single and both adults.

32:55.092 --> 32:56.684
I had a thing with her.

32:57.332 --> 32:59.721
She thought like everybody else thought...

32:59.812 --> 33:01.962
...that I wasn't going to run again.

33:02.292 --> 33:05.762
That I could just hand the mantle over
to anyone I chose...

33:07.772 --> 33:09.524
...so why not a broad?

33:09.852 --> 33:11.046
Why not her?

33:13.132 --> 33:14.281
One more question?

33:14.372 --> 33:17.250
I gave her the B file
because she asked me for it.

33:19.812 --> 33:21.564
Because I was fucking her.

33:23.332 --> 33:24.447
Stupid, huh?

33:26.132 --> 33:28.327
She went over to Northside...

33:30.012 --> 33:32.242
...shoveled through the records.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.243
There wasn't anything there.

33:38.132 --> 33:40.202
At least that's what she told me.

33:43.092 --> 33:45.048
What are you going to do now?

33:45.612 --> 33:47.250
Once the party's over?

33:47.732 --> 33:48.881
I don't know.

33:49.492 --> 33:50.971
I got an idea.

33:52.372 --> 33:54.681
Suppose we try to get you on the bench.

33:54.932 --> 33:58.607
I should still have enough clout
to pull that off. What do you say?

33:59.252 --> 34:01.766
Why don't we just see
what the future holds.

34:06.452 --> 34:08.522
Would that have satisfied her?

34:08.891 --> 34:09.927
What's that?

34:10.012 --> 34:11.081
A judgeship.

34:11.172 --> 34:14.482
I wonder if a judgeship
would've satisfied Carolyn Polhemus.

34:29.411 --> 34:30.367
Rusty!

34:30.452 --> 34:33.603
Come say hello to Carolyn Polhemus.
Have you met?

34:34.331 --> 34:35.731
I've seen Rusty.

34:35.931 --> 34:39.242
I want to bring Carolyn on board
as a prosecuting attorney.

34:39.452 --> 34:43.842
She's been working probation, Northside,
and she just passed her bar exam.

34:44.652 --> 34:45.926
Congratulations.

34:46.012 --> 34:47.127
Thank you.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.686
She comes very highly recommended.

34:51.092 --> 34:53.560
Why don't we see if we can find
a nice place for her.

34:53.652 --> 34:55.563
I'd like the lndex Division.

34:55.891 --> 34:58.281
That's not a job, it's a jail sentence.

34:58.532 --> 35:00.966
Rape, sex crimes, child molestation.

35:01.692 --> 35:03.444
We can do better than that.

35:03.892 --> 35:07.646
It's hard to get a conviction on a rape.
It's a dead-end for someone ambitious.

35:07.732 --> 35:11.247
So you get the worst attorneys
trying the hardest cases?

35:12.372 --> 35:15.728
Listen to this. We got another idealist
in the office.

35:24.692 --> 35:26.444
He's five years old.

35:26.932 --> 35:30.288
The doctors found 23 healed fractures
from old wounds.

35:32.372 --> 35:34.442
Victim of his own beloved mother.

35:35.892 --> 35:37.325
I need your help.

35:37.972 --> 35:39.564
Your wife called.

35:42.852 --> 35:44.604
Why don't you fire her?

35:45.332 --> 35:47.687
Civil service. They're here forever.

35:47.772 --> 35:51.162
Why don't you give this to Nancy.
You haven't had experience with kids.

35:51.252 --> 35:53.004
Nancy's not available.

35:53.132 --> 35:56.169
And, besides,
I'd like to try this case myself.

35:58.292 --> 35:59.566
With your help.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.884
Outline it for me.

36:02.932 --> 36:04.331
About a month ago...

36:04.412 --> 36:07.643
...the mother brought him
into the West End Pavilion Hospital.

36:07.732 --> 36:10.451
The boy was unconscious
from severe head injuries.

36:10.532 --> 36:12.124
She said he fell.

36:12.212 --> 36:13.611
The doctor says...

36:13.932 --> 36:17.561
...the head wounds were too symmetrical
to be the result of a fall.

36:17.972 --> 36:19.405
He told me...

36:19.572 --> 36:23.406
...he was treating a child whose mother
had crushed his head in a vise.

36:25.292 --> 36:27.647
We have any proof it was the mother?
You got the vise?

36:27.732 --> 36:29.882
Just the testimony of the child.

36:30.092 --> 36:34.085
When he sees the mother in
the courtroom, he'll recant. An iffy case.

36:35.052 --> 36:37.520
I've examined him several times and...

36:38.092 --> 36:39.764
...l think he's begun to trust me.

36:39.852 --> 36:43.606
Look, how many child abuse cases
does this office handle in a year?

36:43.732 --> 36:44.926
Over a thousand.

36:45.012 --> 36:46.923
Every one of them terrible.

36:47.532 --> 36:49.329
Every one of them heartbreaking.

36:49.412 --> 36:52.563
But I can't stop everything else
to take care of one case.

36:52.652 --> 36:55.644
You're going to have to get somebody else
to help you.

36:56.292 --> 36:58.203
You don't like me, do you?

36:59.972 --> 37:02.440
I think you've turned out to be
a damn good prosecutor.

37:02.532 --> 37:06.969
You're angry I didn't have to go
through the channels like everyone else.

37:07.772 --> 37:10.411
Clearly, you're not like everyone else.

37:10.532 --> 37:14.730
You think I got this job because
I fucked some fat-cat friend of Raymond's.

37:18.212 --> 37:19.611
Look, it's late....

37:22.572 --> 37:24.961
Come on, I'll drive you to your ferry.

37:28.212 --> 37:30.362
This is not the way to the ferry.

37:30.772 --> 37:32.524
I want you to meet somebody.

37:32.612 --> 37:34.728
Wendell, this is Rusty Sabich.

37:37.412 --> 37:40.006
He's a very important man in our office.

37:40.252 --> 37:43.050
He's going to help me
when we go to court.

37:44.012 --> 37:46.242
Remember what I told you about court?

37:46.532 --> 37:47.567
Yeah.

37:48.292 --> 37:49.725
Now, tell me.

37:50.772 --> 37:52.967
There's a judge and some nice people.

37:53.052 --> 37:54.849
They're called a jury.

37:55.252 --> 37:57.527
And you're gonna ask me questions.

37:58.012 --> 37:59.240
About what?

38:02.732 --> 38:04.450
About what happened.

38:04.972 --> 38:05.927
When?

38:06.612 --> 38:08.045
When I got hurt.

38:08.492 --> 38:10.369
What else did I tell you?

38:11.292 --> 38:14.090
You said that if I told what Mommy did...

38:14.772 --> 38:17.889
...the judge and the nice people
will protect me...

38:18.132 --> 38:20.600
...and Mommy wouldn't hurt me anymore.

38:21.332 --> 38:23.209
Do you think you can do that?

38:23.292 --> 38:25.408
Answer my questions in court?

38:26.092 --> 38:28.287
And tell what Mommy did to you?

38:31.172 --> 38:32.764
I think you can.

38:33.132 --> 38:34.850
Mommy will be there.

38:35.812 --> 38:38.770
She can't hurt you.
She can't even talk to you.

38:39.412 --> 38:41.323
You'll be completely safe.

38:43.772 --> 38:45.091
You promise?

38:46.812 --> 38:48.131
I promise.

38:56.492 --> 38:58.164
His father got to him last night.

38:58.252 --> 39:01.289
Told him God would put him in hell
if he testified against his mother.

39:01.372 --> 39:02.407
He's terrified.

39:02.492 --> 39:05.723
If you're not ready, we'll ask the judge
for a couple more days.

39:05.812 --> 39:06.767
No.

39:06.892 --> 39:09.452
We've got to do it now
or we'll lose him for good.

39:09.532 --> 39:12.729
Your mommy took you to the hospital
because you were hurt.

39:13.252 --> 39:15.129
What part of you was hurt?

39:15.772 --> 39:16.887
My head.

39:17.852 --> 39:19.444
How was it hurt?

39:23.732 --> 39:26.166
Wendell, how did you hurt your head?

39:29.532 --> 39:31.124
I don't remember.

39:35.292 --> 39:37.203
Have you ever seen this?

39:37.732 --> 39:38.642
Yes.

39:38.732 --> 39:39.881
Where?

39:40.252 --> 39:41.970
-In the cellar.
-At home?

39:42.172 --> 39:43.127
Yes.

39:43.292 --> 39:45.681
Did somebody put your head inside it?

39:47.172 --> 39:48.366
Wendell?

39:50.372 --> 39:53.842
What did you say when somebody
put your head in the vise?

39:55.132 --> 39:58.886
You told me you screamed
when your head was put in the vise.

40:00.172 --> 40:01.321
Remember?

40:01.932 --> 40:03.126
You told me.

40:06.092 --> 40:07.411
"l promise...

40:07.572 --> 40:09.085
"...l'll be a good boy.

40:09.172 --> 40:10.810
"l'll be a good boy."

40:11.692 --> 40:13.444
Did somebody answer?

40:15.612 --> 40:16.761
Mommy.

40:17.012 --> 40:20.084
Mommy said I was a bad boy
and I deserved to die.

40:20.692 --> 40:22.648
And then what did Mommy do?

40:23.332 --> 40:25.482
She made it tighter and tighter.

40:25.572 --> 40:26.971
On your head?

40:27.172 --> 40:29.845
She hurt my head.
My mommy hurt my head.

40:31.932 --> 40:33.923
No further questions, Your Honor.

40:34.012 --> 40:36.048
The doctors have told us...

40:36.292 --> 40:37.850
...that the wounds...

40:37.932 --> 40:41.083
...that Wendell suffered
could not have come from a fall...

40:41.172 --> 40:43.606
...as the defense would have you believe.

40:44.532 --> 40:48.241
The police told us they found a vise
at the home of the defendant.

40:49.132 --> 40:51.248
Medical experts have testified...

40:51.412 --> 40:54.688
...that the size and the shape
of the jaws of that vise...

40:54.812 --> 40:59.567
...exactly match the size and the shape
of the wounds to the little boy's head.

40:59.972 --> 41:02.167
And this evidence is clear...

41:02.652 --> 41:04.244
...and uncontested.

41:06.052 --> 41:08.771
But the most compelling evidence
in this trial...

41:08.852 --> 41:11.525
...comes not from doctors,
or police officers...

41:11.732 --> 41:13.848
...or other expert witnesses.

41:14.012 --> 41:16.082
The most damning testimony...

41:16.532 --> 41:19.365
...comes from an abused
and frightened child...

41:19.652 --> 41:22.405
...who overcame his fear and his pain...

41:23.092 --> 41:25.560
...to tell you, in his own words...

41:26.332 --> 41:28.243
...what really happened.

41:29.452 --> 41:33.525
If you're to remember nothing else
as you begin your deliberations...

41:33.612 --> 41:35.523
...remember Wendell's words:

41:36.372 --> 41:38.328
"My mommy hurt my head."

41:39.932 --> 41:41.888
"My mommy hurt my head."

41:46.132 --> 41:48.088
"My mommy hurt my head."

42:24.972 --> 42:26.485
Congratulations.

42:32.252 --> 42:34.083
It's gonna be so good.

45:04.532 --> 45:06.602
You're still in love with her.

45:10.572 --> 45:12.210
It was never love.

45:13.332 --> 45:14.924
What was it, then?

45:21.292 --> 45:22.930
It was never love.

45:25.652 --> 45:28.371
What did she have
to make you feel so much?

45:40.212 --> 45:41.964
Ladies and gentlemen...

45:42.372 --> 45:44.044
...Raymond Horgan.

45:59.132 --> 46:00.884
Thank you. Thank you.

46:02.932 --> 46:04.968
I wanted to come down
and say a few words...

46:05.052 --> 46:09.170
...before I call Mr. Della Guardia
and congratulate him on his victory.

46:10.212 --> 46:11.725
No, no, no. Come on.

46:13.052 --> 46:16.681
Of all the wonderful things
that have happened to me in 12 years...

46:17.452 --> 46:19.249
...the best has been...

46:19.932 --> 46:22.446
...knowing and working with all ofyou.

46:23.372 --> 46:25.840
Wait till you hear what's going down.
It's strange.

46:25.932 --> 46:28.969
Someone's fucked up over at the Hall.
It's way wrong.

46:29.052 --> 46:30.690
-Why?
-I get a message.

46:30.772 --> 46:34.685
I'm supposed to be in the chief's office
8:00 tomorrow to be interviewed.

46:34.772 --> 46:35.727
By Molto.

46:35.812 --> 46:37.689
No discussion. Interview.

46:37.772 --> 46:39.285
It's like they're after me, right?

46:39.372 --> 46:41.567
Another thing. When I came back tonight...

46:41.652 --> 46:45.008
...they took all the receipts
of the evidence I inventoried on Polhemus.

46:45.092 --> 46:46.764
No questions asked.

46:47.292 --> 46:48.725
Sounds like you're off the case.

46:48.812 --> 46:51.087
Sure. Fine, but figure this in.

46:51.212 --> 46:54.966
I'm at the North Branch before 5:00,
going through the microfilm.

46:55.572 --> 46:57.847
All of this hits by 6:00, 6:30.

46:58.692 --> 47:01.490
Look what I picked up
while I was out there.

47:01.692 --> 47:03.808
The case number matches
the complaint number...

47:03.892 --> 47:06.201
...that was missing
when you saw Kenneally.

47:06.292 --> 47:08.203
Five years ago. Bingo.

47:08.812 --> 47:11.724
And look who's listed
as Leon's probation officer.

47:14.132 --> 47:15.167
"Carolyn Polhemus."

47:15.252 --> 47:17.163
Wait. Here's the best.

47:18.092 --> 47:20.890
Who do you think was the deputy
handling the case?

47:23.412 --> 47:24.686
Tommy Molto.

47:25.212 --> 47:29.251
You keep this because I don't know
what the fuck is happening with me.

47:35.972 --> 47:37.325
Tommy Molto.

47:37.932 --> 47:41.686
Tommy Molto once worked here,
but we think he might be dead.

47:42.612 --> 47:44.125
Raymond's inside.

47:44.212 --> 47:45.964
We've been waiting for you.

47:53.892 --> 47:54.881
Rusty.

47:56.452 --> 47:58.044
Molto and Delay...

47:59.732 --> 48:02.610
...have questions about
the Polhemus investigation.

48:03.412 --> 48:05.642
This should not be handled this way.

48:06.052 --> 48:08.122
You should speak with Rusty alone.

48:09.252 --> 48:10.048
What's this about?

48:10.132 --> 48:13.283
You were at Carolyn's apartment
the night she was killed.

48:13.412 --> 48:14.606
Bullshit.

48:20.332 --> 48:22.448
What was it, a Tuesday night?

48:24.692 --> 48:27.411
Barbara was at the university.
I was babysitting.

48:27.492 --> 48:29.528
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

48:29.652 --> 48:31.722
We got the fingerprint results...

48:31.812 --> 48:34.246
...the ones that you could never remember
to ask for.

48:34.332 --> 48:36.721
They're your prints all over the bar glass.

48:36.812 --> 48:38.723
Yours, Rozat K. Sabich.

48:39.452 --> 48:42.125
Five feet from where the woman
was found dead.

48:42.612 --> 48:46.287
Or maybe you didn't remember
that all county employees get printed.

48:50.612 --> 48:52.045
This is absurd.

48:52.652 --> 48:55.564
The phone records
you told Lipranzer not to get?

48:55.692 --> 48:57.842
We had the phone company
pull them this morning.

48:57.932 --> 48:59.809
You were calling her all month.

48:59.892 --> 49:02.770
There's a call from your house
to hers that night.

49:08.292 --> 49:10.123
My God, you're serious.

49:14.052 --> 49:15.724
Tommy, for Christ's sake!

49:15.932 --> 49:16.921
Sabich.

49:17.652 --> 49:19.688
I want you to know one thing. I know.

49:19.772 --> 49:20.648
Sure you do.

49:20.732 --> 49:22.768
Go ahead, play cool. I know.

49:22.892 --> 49:25.122
You killed her. You're the guy.

49:26.092 --> 49:27.047
Oh, yeah?

49:27.132 --> 49:29.930
Yeah, you're right. You're always right.

49:36.532 --> 49:39.569
They think I killed her.
They're going to charge me.

49:40.412 --> 49:43.404
Don't be seen with me, man.
They'll fucking bury you.

49:46.452 --> 49:49.125
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

49:50.932 --> 49:52.365
Are you sick?

49:55.812 --> 49:59.088
Nico and Molto are charging me
with Carolyn's murder.

50:01.772 --> 50:05.242
They found my fingerprints
on a glass of beer in her apartment.

50:09.092 --> 50:10.525
What does this mean?

50:10.652 --> 50:12.608
Grand jury investigation.

50:13.932 --> 50:17.561
They will or they won't indict me.
If they do, there'll be a trial.

50:20.332 --> 50:22.448
It's not going to go that far.

50:25.492 --> 50:27.562
I'm going to need a lawyer.

50:29.812 --> 50:32.372
A very, very good lawyer.
Expensive lawyer.

50:36.052 --> 50:38.122
It could break us financially.

50:39.372 --> 50:41.328
We can mortgage the house.

50:42.292 --> 50:44.044
Or sell it if we have to.

50:47.172 --> 50:49.003
What time does Nat get home?

50:50.612 --> 50:51.601
Nat?

50:54.452 --> 50:55.601
Oh, Rusty!

51:08.652 --> 51:11.530
A lot ofpeople think Raymond
shouldn't run again.

51:12.332 --> 51:17.122
If he agrees to step aside, the party
will let him decide who will take his place.

51:19.052 --> 51:21.407
They know he won't hand it all to Nico.

51:21.492 --> 51:22.891
That's for sure.

51:24.492 --> 51:26.084
Who would he choose?

51:27.892 --> 51:29.564
Somebody from the office.

51:30.532 --> 51:32.329
Carry on his traditions.

51:32.492 --> 51:33.447
You?

51:37.652 --> 51:39.005
Mac, maybe.

51:40.292 --> 51:42.852
She'd make a great candidate,
in that wheelchair.

51:42.932 --> 51:45.321
That chair is not very telegenic.

51:47.292 --> 51:48.930
I think he'd pick you.

51:51.332 --> 51:52.970
You're the natural.

51:58.972 --> 51:59.961
Rusty...

52:00.092 --> 52:02.890
...if you let him know you want it,
it'll be you.

52:03.852 --> 52:06.366
I should just tell Raymond his time is up?

52:06.572 --> 52:08.324
-You could be tactful.
-No.

52:09.372 --> 52:10.521
Why not?

52:11.692 --> 52:13.762
I'm not going to bite that hand.

52:14.172 --> 52:16.481
If Raymond wants out, that's up to him.

52:16.812 --> 52:20.122
He's still the best candidate around,
against Della Guardia.

52:20.372 --> 52:23.205
Without Raymond,
Nico doesn't have an issue.

52:23.572 --> 52:27.247
Pull the party's people and Raymond's
people together behind somebody else...

52:27.332 --> 52:30.165
...that person would walk
into the PA's office.

52:30.692 --> 52:32.250
It wouldn't be close.

52:40.652 --> 52:42.722
You've thought a lot about this.

52:43.452 --> 52:45.249
He just needs a push.

52:48.692 --> 52:51.001
Push him yourself. It's not in me.

52:57.212 --> 52:58.122
What?

52:58.852 --> 53:01.525
Were you all set on being chief deputy?

53:03.332 --> 53:04.367
Carolyn...

53:06.372 --> 53:09.842
...if I can get away tonight
shall I get some take-out?

53:10.812 --> 53:13.372
I like you, Rusty, but I think it's over.

53:14.412 --> 53:16.926
It's just not right for me now. It's over.

53:17.012 --> 53:18.650
I don't accept that.

53:18.852 --> 53:20.365
You don't accept it?

53:20.492 --> 53:21.925
Do I have a say?

53:24.372 --> 53:26.408
I don't want us to end up enemies.

53:34.532 --> 53:36.488
Mac said it was all right.

53:36.852 --> 53:38.251
Have it your way.

53:41.372 --> 53:43.044
Someone's in my office.

53:44.932 --> 53:46.081
What is it, Rusty?

53:46.172 --> 53:48.970
I wanted to talk about this rapist
you habitualized.

53:49.052 --> 53:50.610
There's some problems.

53:51.452 --> 53:53.283
I'm late for an appointment.

53:53.492 --> 53:56.643
I would appreciate it
if you could put it in a memo.

53:57.252 --> 53:58.731
You keep avoiding me.

53:58.812 --> 54:02.248
You communicate through memos.
You skip meetings I'm supposed to go to.

54:02.332 --> 54:03.924
It's affecting work.

54:04.012 --> 54:05.081
My work?

54:06.212 --> 54:07.361
My work.

54:08.492 --> 54:10.722
I tried to make it easier for you.

54:13.692 --> 54:15.683
You make me feel uncomfortable.

54:15.772 --> 54:18.809
I just want to be with you.
Can't we just talk about it?

54:20.412 --> 54:22.687
I'm involved with someone else.

54:23.732 --> 54:24.960
Since when?

54:25.452 --> 54:27.363
What is it you want from me?

54:29.172 --> 54:30.730
What do I have to do?

54:32.892 --> 54:33.927
Grow up.

55:10.292 --> 55:11.771
Rozat K. Sabich?

55:14.132 --> 55:15.963
Rusty, I don't like to be here.

55:16.052 --> 55:18.202
A search warrant for these premises.

55:20.972 --> 55:22.246
Come on in.

55:38.332 --> 55:40.721
They're taking swatches from your suits.

55:40.972 --> 55:44.009
They'll try to match threads
from my clothing and the carpet...

55:44.092 --> 55:46.811
...with fibers they might find
at her apartment.

55:46.892 --> 55:49.281
They're not looking for a murder weapon?

55:49.372 --> 55:51.442
I wouldn't be stupid enough
to bring it home.

55:51.532 --> 55:55.525
If they look for it and don't find it,
they'll have to admit that in court.

55:56.012 --> 55:58.242
I'll have to give a blood sample.

55:58.692 --> 56:00.011
If you refuse?

56:00.532 --> 56:02.250
They've got a warrant.

56:02.412 --> 56:03.970
It's all routine.

56:05.132 --> 56:07.851
I'm going to ask Sandy Stern
to take my case.

56:13.612 --> 56:14.886
Hi, Sandy.

56:22.012 --> 56:25.687
I realize you would like to avoid
public places at a time like this...

56:25.772 --> 56:29.208
...but I don't think it is wise
for you to go into hiding.

56:30.332 --> 56:33.563
I'm flattered that you want me
to represent you in this case.

56:33.652 --> 56:36.166
You have been my toughest adversary.

56:38.052 --> 56:40.885
Did you get my subpoena
from the grand jury?

56:41.052 --> 56:43.930
This morning.
Clearly, we will not let you testify.

56:45.772 --> 56:48.809
Sandy, you expect me
to take the Fifth Amendment?

56:49.132 --> 56:50.406
Of course.

56:52.172 --> 56:53.525
That I cannot do.

56:55.052 --> 56:59.091
You don't want to prepare the prosecutor
by giving him pretrial statements.

56:59.172 --> 57:02.721
Sandy, I don't think this case
is ever going to go to trial.

57:03.452 --> 57:06.728
If I take the Fifth and refuse to testify
before the grand jury...

57:06.812 --> 57:08.882
...it could destroy my reputation.

57:11.452 --> 57:13.602
The results of the blood tests
have come back.

57:13.692 --> 57:17.162
They have identified you as someone
who secretes A-type antibodies...

57:17.252 --> 57:20.483
...just like the man who had last been
with Ms. Polhemus.

57:20.812 --> 57:23.690
Chances of this being a coincidence
are one in ten.

57:23.812 --> 57:27.691
So, I believe you will be charged
and that you will go to trial.

57:27.852 --> 57:32.323
Have you anything to tell this grand jury
about the death of Carolyn Polhemus?

57:32.612 --> 57:35.206
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

57:35.452 --> 57:39.650
Wouldn't it be fair to say you were rather
well acquainted with Ms. Polhemus?

57:39.852 --> 57:42.047
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

57:42.132 --> 57:44.805
Weren't you, in fact,
intimate with the lady?

57:46.252 --> 57:48.846
On the advice of counsel,
I decline to answer.

57:49.852 --> 57:52.924
You are under arrest.
"You have the right to remain silent.

57:53.012 --> 57:55.890
"Anything you say can and will
be used against you.

57:56.092 --> 57:59.528
"You have the right to have a lawyer
present during questioning.

57:59.972 --> 58:03.726
"lf you cannot hire a lawyer,
one will be appointed to represent you.

58:05.732 --> 58:08.451
"You may stop answering questions
at any time."

58:08.572 --> 58:11.132
Do you understand the rights
I have explained to you?

58:11.212 --> 58:13.203
Call Sandy Stern to make bail.

58:27.212 --> 58:29.123
Sandy should be available in a few hours.

58:29.212 --> 58:31.043
Let's see what they got.

58:31.852 --> 58:34.082
Can't believe there could be
any more surprises.

58:34.172 --> 58:37.369
That's when they come.
That's why they're called surprises.

58:41.052 --> 58:43.441
Do we now understand
Della Guardia's case?

58:44.812 --> 58:46.245
Yes, I think I do.

58:47.452 --> 58:48.885
Let me hear it.

58:52.652 --> 58:54.882
Sabich is obsessed with Polhemus.

58:55.532 --> 58:57.602
She ditches him for another man.

58:58.092 --> 58:59.844
Sabich becomes enraged.

58:59.932 --> 59:01.445
He can't let go.

59:02.092 --> 59:04.162
One night, knowing his wife is out...

59:04.252 --> 59:06.891
...he calls her and begs her
to see him again.

59:07.452 --> 59:09.363
Carolyn finally agrees.

59:10.492 --> 59:13.290
She rolls around with him
for auld lang syne.

59:13.572 --> 59:15.005
Then something goes wrong.

59:15.092 --> 59:18.402
Sabich is jealous. He wants more
than she's willing to give.

59:19.052 --> 59:20.201
He blows it.

59:20.292 --> 59:22.886
Gives her what for
with some heavy instrument.

59:23.092 --> 59:25.322
Decides to make it look like rape.

59:25.652 --> 59:29.327
Sabich is a prosecutor,
knows there'll be dozens of suspects.

59:30.092 --> 59:31.366
He ties her up.

59:31.452 --> 59:34.728
Opens the latches to make it look
like someone slipped in.

59:36.012 --> 59:38.162
And this is the diabolical part...

59:38.932 --> 59:41.685
...pulls out her diaphragm
so it looks like rape.

59:41.972 --> 59:44.930
But in his haste and confusion,
he makes mistakes.

59:45.652 --> 59:47.768
He forgets the glass he drank from.

59:47.932 --> 59:51.891
He doesn't think the forensic chemist
will be able to ID the spermicide.

59:52.652 --> 59:55.041
But we know he did evil to this woman...

59:55.252 --> 59:59.564
...because he lied about his presence
in her apartment the night she was killed.

01:00:00.052 --> 01:00:02.088
His fingerprints on the glass...

01:00:02.172 --> 01:00:04.732
...his blood type A identified from semen...

01:00:05.212 --> 01:00:08.921
...fibers from the carpets in his home,
tell us he was there.

01:00:10.892 --> 01:00:12.484
Very convincing.

01:00:14.572 --> 01:00:16.802
But their evidence of motive is weak.

01:00:16.892 --> 01:00:18.883
That's where we must attack.

01:00:19.332 --> 01:00:23.325
Is there any proof of prior
amorous relationship between the two?

01:00:23.572 --> 01:00:24.607
A few telephone calls.

01:00:24.692 --> 01:00:26.728
They can be accounted for
by business needs.

01:00:26.812 --> 01:00:28.006
-Any diary?
-No.

01:00:28.732 --> 01:00:31.644
No note that came with flowers?
No lovers' correspondence?

01:00:31.732 --> 01:00:32.847
-No.
-Good.

01:00:32.932 --> 01:00:34.445
Gossip will not be admitted.

01:00:34.532 --> 01:00:38.366
There are calls from my home to Carolyn's
in October of last year.

01:00:38.532 --> 01:00:41.365
You were trying the case
of Wendell McGaffney then.

01:00:41.652 --> 01:00:43.324
Reason enough for calling her.

01:00:43.412 --> 01:00:46.609
Why did I tell Lipranzer not to get
my home phone records?

01:00:46.692 --> 01:00:49.923
I take it for granted that a person
of an innocent state of mind...

01:00:50.012 --> 01:00:51.968
...would rule himself out as a suspect...

01:00:52.052 --> 01:00:54.930
...and save a busy detective
from wasting time.

01:00:56.212 --> 01:00:59.966
Clearly, they hope to win the case
on the strength of their physical evidence.

01:01:00.052 --> 01:01:02.964
I'd like to look at that glass.
It could help me.

01:01:03.052 --> 01:01:05.282
List a motion for production
of physical evidence.

01:01:05.372 --> 01:01:07.840
I want an inventory of everything
in that apartment.

01:01:07.932 --> 01:01:10.207
Where's the contraceptive jelly...

01:01:10.492 --> 01:01:14.121
...the chemist is saying he finds present?
ln her medicine cabinet?

01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:15.611
I don't know.

01:01:18.572 --> 01:01:20.483
I'll hear worse in court.

01:01:21.132 --> 01:01:23.362
I never asked her what she was doing.

01:01:23.492 --> 01:01:24.971
One word of caution.

01:01:25.172 --> 01:01:27.561
We do not want to lead Della Guardia...

01:01:27.772 --> 01:01:30.445
...to evidence he has not thought to obtain.

01:01:30.892 --> 01:01:34.885
Best we conduct a search ourselves
without disclosing our intentions.

01:01:35.452 --> 01:01:39.730
Also, your mention of Carolyn's
personal habits leads to this thought.

01:01:40.692 --> 01:01:42.887
We should subpoena her doctors.

01:01:43.372 --> 01:01:45.328
Who knows what we might discover.

01:01:45.412 --> 01:01:47.721
There's one big surprise, however.

01:01:49.452 --> 01:01:51.807
Raymond Horgan's on their witness list.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:53.327
Why?

01:01:54.612 --> 01:01:57.172
It's a hell of a way to impress
my new partners.

01:01:57.252 --> 01:02:00.130
I'm here three days
and I get a grand jury subpoena.

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:04.767
I was wondering what we might expect,
in terms of your testimony.

01:02:06.532 --> 01:02:10.445
I'm going to testify about Rusty's conduct
of the Polhemus investigation.

01:02:10.772 --> 01:02:13.525
-How he volunteered to handle it.
-Just a second.

01:02:14.692 --> 01:02:16.603
You insisted I take it on.

01:02:16.772 --> 01:02:18.285
I don't remember it that way.

01:02:18.372 --> 01:02:20.283
What are you trying to do to me?

01:02:20.372 --> 01:02:22.283
What am I trying to do to you?

01:02:23.012 --> 01:02:25.003
What are you trying to do to me?

01:02:28.692 --> 01:02:30.523
I thought I had your loyalty.

01:02:34.012 --> 01:02:36.651
Why didn't you tell me
about you and Carolyn?

01:02:36.732 --> 01:02:40.645
Under the circumstances,
I have to advise Rusty not to respond.

01:02:41.932 --> 01:02:43.604
Clearly, he would like to.

01:02:43.772 --> 01:02:45.728
Let me ask you something.

01:02:46.212 --> 01:02:49.204
Why were his fingerprints
all over that goddamn glass?

01:02:50.692 --> 01:02:52.762
That's what I'm going to testify.

01:02:53.252 --> 01:02:55.004
That he wanted the case.

01:02:55.332 --> 01:02:58.369
That I had to chew his ass
to get him to move on it.

01:02:59.452 --> 01:03:01.841
He seemed more interested in if,
when and how...

01:03:01.932 --> 01:03:05.208
...l was fucking Carolyn Polhemus
than in his own investigation.

01:03:05.292 --> 01:03:07.886
When push came to shove,
he stood in my office...

01:03:07.972 --> 01:03:12.409
...he told us he'd been nowhere near
her apartment the night she was killed.

01:03:15.252 --> 01:03:17.322
That's what I'm going to testify.

01:03:17.892 --> 01:03:20.247
And I'll be goddamned pleased to do it.

01:03:21.332 --> 01:03:24.290
How can you think
that I could do a thing like that?

01:03:27.732 --> 01:03:30.200
You always had the cork in too tight.

01:03:31.172 --> 01:03:32.685
We all saw that.

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:36.923
When you blew, you blew.

01:03:38.572 --> 01:03:40.085
Come on, Rusty.

01:03:47.452 --> 01:03:51.331
When did this relationship take place
between Raymond and Carolyn?

01:03:51.612 --> 01:03:53.887
Just after she stopped seeing me.

01:03:56.052 --> 01:03:57.883
Delay's got his motive.

01:04:00.052 --> 01:04:04.364
What if I told you Raymond secretly
assigned a bribery case to Carolyn?

01:04:05.092 --> 01:04:08.368
Some poor son of a bitch
on a public-indecency charge...

01:04:08.452 --> 01:04:10.966
...paid off a PA to have his case dismissed.

01:04:11.132 --> 01:04:14.442
Turns out, the guy's probation officer
is Carolyn...

01:04:15.132 --> 01:04:18.204
...and the deputy assigned to the case
is Tommy Molto.

01:04:19.252 --> 01:04:23.006
Day after I find this out,
I'm charged with Carolyn's murder.

01:04:25.412 --> 01:04:28.165
Before we venture down the road
into actual accusation...

01:04:28.252 --> 01:04:30.846
...we must consider the matter
very carefully.

01:04:33.572 --> 01:04:36.769
It can't be a coincidence
it lays out this way, Sandy.

01:04:42.292 --> 01:04:44.089
I mean, I'm innocent.

01:04:51.172 --> 01:04:53.732
God, I made a fool of myself today
with Sandy.

01:04:54.052 --> 01:04:55.121
How?

01:04:55.492 --> 01:04:57.244
I told him I was innocent.

01:04:58.572 --> 01:05:00.767
I thought he would've asked you that
by now.

01:05:00.852 --> 01:05:02.365
No, it's axiomatic.

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:05.082
Defendants rarely tell the truth.

01:05:06.172 --> 01:05:10.370
Lie to the cops, lie to your lawyer,
lie to the jury that tries your case.

01:05:11.812 --> 01:05:14.690
Leave the bastards out there
with a grain of doubt.

01:05:20.212 --> 01:05:21.645
You never asked.

01:05:23.572 --> 01:05:25.164
If you're innocent?

01:05:29.932 --> 01:05:31.445
You want me to?

01:05:47.492 --> 01:05:48.925
Please draw a name.

01:05:57.092 --> 01:05:58.923
"Judge Larren Lyttle."

01:05:59.732 --> 01:06:02.007
I have some motions from the defense.

01:06:02.092 --> 01:06:04.970
Mr. Stern, you want to examine
the scene of the crime?

01:06:05.052 --> 01:06:07.771
Yes, Your Honor.
To evaluate the physical evidence...

01:06:07.852 --> 01:06:11.162
...to see if it actually proves
what the prosecution claims.

01:06:11.372 --> 01:06:12.725
Mr. Della Guardia?

01:06:12.932 --> 01:06:15.685
With proviso that nothing be removed,
nothing disturbed.

01:06:15.772 --> 01:06:17.683
-No objection.
-Granted.

01:06:18.372 --> 01:06:20.283
Mr. Stern, anything further?

01:06:20.612 --> 01:06:23.809
We notice that Mr. Molto is listed
both as a prosecutor...

01:06:23.892 --> 01:06:27.168
...and as a witness for the prosecution.
We object to that.

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:29.760
I take it you are speaking
of where Mr. Sabich...

01:06:29.852 --> 01:06:33.845
...responds to Mr. Molto's accusation
of murder by saying: "You're right."

01:06:35.332 --> 01:06:37.129
"Yeah, you're right."

01:06:37.652 --> 01:06:40.007
Your Honor, the man admitted the crime.

01:06:40.132 --> 01:06:42.646
Come on, Mr. Delay Guardia. Really.

01:06:43.652 --> 01:06:47.565
Tell a man he's engaged in wrongdoing
and he says, "Yeah, you're right."

01:06:47.692 --> 01:06:50.923
Everyone knows that's facetious.
We're all familiar with that.

01:06:51.012 --> 01:06:54.209
Shit, if Mr. Sabich had come
from my neighborhood...

01:06:54.452 --> 01:06:56.602
...he would've said, "Your momma."

01:06:57.572 --> 01:07:01.406
But, in Mr. Sabich's part of town
I would think they would say:

01:07:01.892 --> 01:07:03.564
"Yeah, you're right."

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:06.325
And what they mean is, "You are wrong."

01:07:06.652 --> 01:07:08.290
Just to be polite.

01:07:10.372 --> 01:07:13.409
Your Honor, isn't that a question
for the jury?

01:07:13.732 --> 01:07:18.044
On the contrary, Mr. Delay Guardia,
it is first a question for the court.

01:07:18.692 --> 01:07:22.844
If you use Mr. Sabich's statement
and risk my ruling it out of order...

01:07:23.332 --> 01:07:25.641
...then I will bar Mr. Molto
from prosecuting.

01:07:25.732 --> 01:07:27.848
But if he is the prosecutor...

01:07:28.452 --> 01:07:31.330
...then Mr. Sabich's statement
may not be offered.

01:07:32.372 --> 01:07:34.840
And I'll see you in court in three weeks.

01:07:36.172 --> 01:07:38.606
Ernestine, show in the next bunch.

01:07:46.692 --> 01:07:49.001
What the fuck are you doing with those?

01:07:49.092 --> 01:07:53.722
We don't want Molto thinking fingerprints
we leave here today are from before.

01:07:55.212 --> 01:07:59.046
We're not going to plant anything,
if that's what you're worried about.

01:08:01.212 --> 01:08:02.645
The law's the law.

01:08:04.092 --> 01:08:06.003
Yeah, I know, Glendenning.

01:08:12.252 --> 01:08:13.526
Diaphragm?

01:08:14.972 --> 01:08:16.644
I don't know. The bathroom?

01:08:16.732 --> 01:08:17.846
Where?

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:04.487
Nothing.

01:09:04.732 --> 01:09:06.962
Fucking cops always forget something.

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:09.046
What is it?

01:09:09.372 --> 01:09:10.645
Her phone book.

01:09:11.131 --> 01:09:13.930
Check with her doctors
on the contraceptive stuff.

01:09:14.492 --> 01:09:17.006
Carolyn never seemed worried
about anything like that.

01:09:17.091 --> 01:09:20.845
She's got them under "D."
Jesus, she's got a lot of doctors.

01:09:21.932 --> 01:09:25.890
If the chemist says spermicide is present,
and it's not seized from here...

01:09:25.971 --> 01:09:27.849
...then you tell me where it's at?

01:09:27.932 --> 01:09:31.287
I don't know. Maybe I took it
when I took the diaphragm.

01:09:32.091 --> 01:09:33.844
It doesn't make sense.

01:09:35.452 --> 01:09:38.649
You got to remember,
I wasn't thinking very clearly.

01:09:40.412 --> 01:09:43.926
If I had been, I wouldn't have left
my fingerprints on the glass.

01:09:45.572 --> 01:09:47.323
You were a former chief deputy prosecutor.

01:09:47.412 --> 01:09:49.880
How does it feel to be on the other side?

01:09:52.812 --> 01:09:55.372
Think you might be a political scapegoat?

01:09:55.612 --> 01:09:59.002
Sorry, we're not about to try this case
on the courthouse steps.

01:09:59.092 --> 01:10:01.287
How do you feel about your husband, now?

01:10:01.372 --> 01:10:02.487
All rise.

01:10:05.212 --> 01:10:08.568
The Superior Court for the county
of Kindle is now in session.

01:10:08.652 --> 01:10:11.769
The Honorable Larren L. Lyttle,
judge presiding.

01:10:12.732 --> 01:10:15.849
Draw near and give your attention
and you shall be heard.

01:10:15.932 --> 01:10:19.004
God save the United States
and this honorable court.

01:10:19.172 --> 01:10:22.005
The People vs. Rozat K. Sabich, for trial.

01:10:23.372 --> 01:10:25.010
May it please the court.

01:10:25.172 --> 01:10:28.482
The State's evidence will show
that on or about April 1 ...

01:10:28.652 --> 01:10:31.928
...Carolyn Polhemus, a deputy prosecutor
in Kindle County...

01:10:32.732 --> 01:10:34.484
...was brutally murdered.

01:10:35.452 --> 01:10:39.331
The proof will show that this murder
was perpetrated by her colleague...

01:10:39.772 --> 01:10:41.490
...Rozat K. Sabich.

01:10:42.692 --> 01:10:45.365
How are we to answer this,
Rusty Sabich and l?

01:10:46.892 --> 01:10:51.204
Mr. Della Guardia's case involves no facts
but supposition upon supposition.

01:10:52.012 --> 01:10:53.650
Guess upon guess.

01:10:55.052 --> 01:10:57.805
When you listen to the evidence,
ask yourselves...

01:10:57.932 --> 01:10:59.604
...why Rusty Sabich...

01:11:00.572 --> 01:11:03.132
...the finest prosecutor of this county...

01:11:04.412 --> 01:11:07.324
...a man who has devoted his life
to preventing...

01:11:07.532 --> 01:11:11.047
...and punishing criminal behavior,
not to committing it...

01:11:13.372 --> 01:11:15.442
...sits here as the accused.

01:11:16.892 --> 01:11:17.927
Why?

01:11:18.092 --> 01:11:20.003
The State calls Detective Harold Greer.

01:11:20.092 --> 01:11:22.322
May we have a word with the bench?

01:11:23.772 --> 01:11:27.685
This witness will testify about a bar glass.
They have no bar glass.

01:11:28.132 --> 01:11:29.611
What about this?

01:11:29.932 --> 01:11:32.810
I learned the first time last night,
from Tommy....

01:11:33.212 --> 01:11:35.567
Hold it right there. Inside, gentlemen.

01:11:35.812 --> 01:11:38.724
I request that Mr. Sabich join us
in chambers.

01:11:38.812 --> 01:11:41.201
He is an integral part of the defense.

01:11:44.412 --> 01:11:46.130
Where is the fucking glass?

01:11:46.212 --> 01:11:50.683
Police Evidence Room was where it
was supposed to be, but they can't find it.

01:11:51.132 --> 01:11:55.284
We won't be talking about evidence
that nobody can find. Not in my court.

01:11:57.732 --> 01:12:01.850
We don't object to the photographs,
just to testimony about fingerprints.

01:12:02.692 --> 01:12:04.887
I will reserve decision, gentlemen.

01:12:07.132 --> 01:12:10.602
A stroke of luck. Their disorganization
will help us with the jury.

01:12:10.692 --> 01:12:12.523
They'll find the glass. They always do.

01:12:12.612 --> 01:12:15.490
Ladies and gentlemen,
these photos depict horrors...

01:12:15.572 --> 01:12:18.484
...you may be expected to react to
with disgust.

01:12:19.252 --> 01:12:21.447
But I am instructing you,
that in themselves...

01:12:21.532 --> 01:12:24.888
...they are proof of nothing
except the nature of the crime.

01:12:38.132 --> 01:12:39.611
How you doing?

01:12:40.132 --> 01:12:43.204
-They making it tough on you?
- Those cupcakes? Come on.

01:12:43.812 --> 01:12:45.768
Is there anything you need?

01:12:46.932 --> 01:12:49.765
Yeah, I got to find this guy, Leon.
Leon Wells.

01:12:49.932 --> 01:12:53.766
The guy who's supposed to have bribed
the PA at the North Branch.

01:12:55.012 --> 01:12:57.845
I wouldn't ask, but it might really matter.

01:12:58.132 --> 01:13:01.886
Think Molto's kinky on this?
Set you up to keep you from looking?

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:05.522
You want to hear me say
I think it might be possible? I do.

01:13:05.652 --> 01:13:07.449
Okay, after I testify.

01:13:08.012 --> 01:13:09.525
They got their eyes on me.

01:13:09.612 --> 01:13:13.446
When I'm off the stand, they'll ease up.
I'll work on it then. Hard.

01:13:14.012 --> 01:13:15.286
You're a pal.

01:13:18.012 --> 01:13:19.445
Is he gonna help?

01:13:20.772 --> 01:13:23.570
After he testifies.
Might be too late by then.

01:13:24.732 --> 01:13:26.643
I think it's going well.

01:13:27.452 --> 01:13:31.127
The jury's gonna remember pictures
of Carolyn tortured to death.

01:13:32.892 --> 01:13:35.247
They'll want somebody to pay
for what they saw.

01:13:35.332 --> 01:13:36.651
Tomorrow, Raymond...

01:13:36.732 --> 01:13:40.407
...my friend and mentor,
will testify he thinks I'm guilty.

01:13:42.532 --> 01:13:44.602
Then come the physical proofs:

01:13:44.932 --> 01:13:47.526
Fingerprints. Fiber. Bodily fluids.

01:13:51.612 --> 01:13:53.284
They all point to me.

01:13:53.732 --> 01:13:56.087
You know the defendant, Rozat Sabich?

01:13:56.972 --> 01:14:00.521
Sure, I know Rusty. I've known him
since he was a law student.

01:14:00.612 --> 01:14:02.011
He was my second in command.

01:14:02.092 --> 01:14:03.844
Would you identify him?

01:14:09.292 --> 01:14:10.441
That's him.

01:14:12.372 --> 01:14:16.331
You assigned Mr. Sabich to supervise
the investigation in this case?

01:14:18.332 --> 01:14:19.765
He volunteered.

01:14:19.852 --> 01:14:21.080
And I accepted.

01:14:21.492 --> 01:14:23.881
He promised to pursue it vigorously.

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.161
Did he?

01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:27.362
Not to my way of thinking, no.

01:14:28.332 --> 01:14:31.051
I got the feeling he was stalling
on the investigation.

01:14:31.132 --> 01:14:33.930
I let him know that I wasn't happy
about that.

01:14:36.212 --> 01:14:39.284
He brought in his own detective
to replace Harold Greer.

01:14:39.492 --> 01:14:42.848
Then he gave his new partner instructions
to ignore evidence...

01:14:42.932 --> 01:14:46.083
...about telephone calls
between his house and Carolyn's.

01:14:47.372 --> 01:14:51.251
He tried to limit the scope of
the fingerprint search to exclude his own.

01:14:53.572 --> 01:14:57.770
He was more interested in whether I had
been intimate with Carolyn Polhemus...

01:14:58.012 --> 01:15:00.162
...than in the facts surrounding her murder.

01:15:00.252 --> 01:15:02.720
What did you tell him
about you and Ms. Polhemus?

01:15:02.812 --> 01:15:04.325
I told him the truth.

01:15:05.012 --> 01:15:07.162
That we'd been together
for about three months.

01:15:07.252 --> 01:15:09.288
This, of course, was after I was divorced.

01:15:09.372 --> 01:15:11.442
At that time, or any other time...

01:15:11.572 --> 01:15:14.291
...did he inform you
of his personal relationship with her?

01:15:14.372 --> 01:15:18.331
There is no proof in the record
of any relationship between them.

01:15:18.732 --> 01:15:20.643
I'll let the question stand.

01:15:21.612 --> 01:15:25.844
But Mr. Della Guardia is asking a question
based on his assumption...

01:15:26.452 --> 01:15:30.570
...that something was going on
between Mr. Sabich and Ms. Polhemus.

01:15:30.932 --> 01:15:33.082
Just because he thinks it's so...

01:15:33.332 --> 01:15:34.924
...doesn't make it so.

01:15:35.692 --> 01:15:36.807
Proceed.

01:15:37.572 --> 01:15:40.006
I never would've let him handle
the investigation...

01:15:40.092 --> 01:15:42.970
...if I thought he'd been intimate
with the victim.

01:15:43.412 --> 01:15:45.004
Nothing further.

01:15:45.612 --> 01:15:47.091
Have you any...

01:15:47.372 --> 01:15:49.203
...personal knowledge...

01:15:49.332 --> 01:15:53.371
...that there was ever a relationship
between Mr. Sabich and Ms. Polhemus?

01:15:53.652 --> 01:15:55.324
That's the point. He didn't tell me.

01:15:55.412 --> 01:15:57.687
Please answer the question I asked you.

01:15:59.052 --> 01:16:00.929
Do you remember the question?

01:16:01.132 --> 01:16:02.087
I do.

01:16:02.612 --> 01:16:04.603
But you chose not to answer it.

01:16:05.452 --> 01:16:07.170
I apologize, Mr. Stern.

01:16:07.412 --> 01:16:11.041
I have no personal knowledge
that such a relationship ever existed.

01:16:11.292 --> 01:16:13.806
Assuming there was something
to disclose...

01:16:13.932 --> 01:16:18.130
...you believe he should have informed
anyone in a responsible position?

01:16:18.212 --> 01:16:18.962
I do.

01:16:19.052 --> 01:16:22.408
Certainly you would give any information
you had on a case...

01:16:22.532 --> 01:16:24.682
...to your investigating staff?

01:16:24.852 --> 01:16:26.080
Certainly.

01:16:26.932 --> 01:16:28.126
Mr. Horgan...

01:16:28.572 --> 01:16:31.530
...you removed a file, a so-called B file...

01:16:31.852 --> 01:16:35.891
...from Ms. Polhemus's office after
the investigation of her murder began?

01:16:36.292 --> 01:16:37.964
What's the relevance of this?

01:16:38.052 --> 01:16:40.805
The witness has testified
on direct examination...

01:16:40.892 --> 01:16:44.601
...that Mr. Sabich did not bring
to his attention information...

01:16:44.772 --> 01:16:46.285
...that he regarded as pertinent.

01:16:46.372 --> 01:16:50.809
The defense is entitled to explore
Mr. Horgan's standards in this regard.

01:16:51.412 --> 01:16:54.210
Subject to a later connection, I'll allow it.

01:16:55.012 --> 01:16:56.445
Continue, Counselor.

01:16:56.932 --> 01:16:59.730
And you gave that B file to Mr. Sabich...

01:17:00.132 --> 01:17:04.011
...only after he informed you it was missing
from Ms. Polhemus's office?

01:17:04.812 --> 01:17:06.131
That's true.

01:17:07.172 --> 01:17:09.970
You've told us that you
and Carolyn were lovers.

01:17:10.532 --> 01:17:12.090
For a short time, yes.

01:17:13.092 --> 01:17:14.571
B-file cases...

01:17:15.012 --> 01:17:17.970
...cases involving bribery
and official misconduct...

01:17:18.412 --> 01:17:21.484
...are normally assigned
to the assistant deputy.

01:17:21.892 --> 01:17:24.360
At the time, Mr. Sabich. Is that not true?

01:17:24.452 --> 01:17:26.170
That was the usual practice, yes.

01:17:26.252 --> 01:17:29.722
You gave this highly sensitive matter
in this B file...

01:17:29.932 --> 01:17:32.810
...to Carolyn Polhemus
while you were sleeping with her?

01:17:32.892 --> 01:17:34.928
That appears to be the time frame.

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:39.122
The answer to the question is yes.

01:17:40.492 --> 01:17:45.008
Weren't you concerned, in the midst
of a nip-and-tuck election campaign...

01:17:45.412 --> 01:17:48.688
...about word leaking out
that you had secretly given a file...

01:17:48.772 --> 01:17:51.047
...that was in Mr. Sabich's area
of authority...

01:17:51.132 --> 01:17:53.771
...to an assistant with no experience
in such matters...

01:17:53.852 --> 01:17:56.320
...with whom you were sleeping
at the time?

01:17:57.412 --> 01:17:59.323
It may have crossed my mind.

01:18:00.452 --> 01:18:03.171
Who knows? It was not an ideal situation.

01:18:04.612 --> 01:18:05.806
Far from it.

01:18:07.532 --> 01:18:08.681
And, sir...

01:18:09.212 --> 01:18:11.123
...you come to this courtroom...

01:18:11.212 --> 01:18:13.089
...where the life of a man...

01:18:13.212 --> 01:18:17.205
...who served you faithfully for 1 2 years
now hangs in the balance...

01:18:17.372 --> 01:18:19.966
...and you tell us
you withheld evidence from him...

01:18:20.052 --> 01:18:23.010
...that might have assisted
in his investigation?

01:18:34.372 --> 01:18:35.441
All right.

01:18:38.892 --> 01:18:40.450
Is it fair to say...

01:18:40.932 --> 01:18:43.844
...that the chief deputy is the person
in the office...

01:18:43.932 --> 01:18:46.969
...in whose judgement you place
the greatest confidence?

01:18:48.732 --> 01:18:51.610
I regarded him as the best lawyer
for the job, yes.

01:18:51.732 --> 01:18:54.292
And you gave Mr. Sabich the authority...

01:18:54.732 --> 01:18:57.963
...to decide when and where
to fire Mr. Della Guardia?

01:18:58.172 --> 01:18:59.491
Gentlemen...

01:19:00.052 --> 01:19:01.804
...let's stop right there.

01:19:03.732 --> 01:19:06.121
What is the relevance of who fired who?

01:19:06.332 --> 01:19:10.484
Judge, it's our theory that Mr. Sabich
is being framed in this case.

01:19:11.892 --> 01:19:14.725
-I don't believe it.
-Your response has been noted.

01:19:14.972 --> 01:19:18.009
If Mr. Stern is truly going to endeavor
to prove...

01:19:18.132 --> 01:19:21.442
...that the case against Mr. Sabich
has been manufactured...

01:19:21.572 --> 01:19:25.201
...then this history of antagonism
is relevant for those purposes.

01:19:25.332 --> 01:19:27.527
What about this missing B file?

01:19:27.612 --> 01:19:30.524
We believe it's being withheld
because it contains evidence...

01:19:30.612 --> 01:19:32.648
...that is necessary to the defense.

01:19:32.732 --> 01:19:35.371
So, we intend to pursue this matter...

01:19:35.812 --> 01:19:39.441
...until we have a full understanding
on how it bears on the truth.

01:19:39.772 --> 01:19:43.367
I don't know where this will lead us,
but I'll tell you two things:

01:19:43.532 --> 01:19:46.205
You'd better be prepared
for the prosecution's response...

01:19:46.292 --> 01:19:50.524
...because he is going to be entitled
to a great deal of latitude in answering.

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:53.047
'Cause I am going to give him that.

01:19:57.772 --> 01:20:01.685
Do you recall we spoke about a B file
that you assigned to Ms. Polhemus?

01:20:02.412 --> 01:20:04.403
I'll remember it for quite some time.

01:20:04.492 --> 01:20:07.529
-Was Mr. Molto involved in this case?
-Objection!

01:20:07.652 --> 01:20:09.085
Objection sustained.

01:20:09.252 --> 01:20:11.766
Mr. Stern, you're playing with fire.

01:20:13.332 --> 01:20:16.722
Do you know what investigation, if any,
Mr. Molto pursued--

01:20:16.812 --> 01:20:18.768
I'll answer that! He took no action.

01:20:18.852 --> 01:20:21.207
He wasn't going to chase
Sabich's red herrings.

01:20:21.292 --> 01:20:24.602
Mr. Della Guardia, you will remember
you're the prosecutor...

01:20:24.692 --> 01:20:26.205
...not the witness.

01:20:31.852 --> 01:20:35.925
Perhaps we can all learn something
about red herrings and scapegoats.

01:20:36.892 --> 01:20:38.245
That is all.

01:20:38.652 --> 01:20:41.120
This court is adjourned for the weekend.

01:20:42.652 --> 01:20:44.882
I don't understand what you're doing.

01:20:45.292 --> 01:20:47.203
You're alienating the judge.

01:20:47.452 --> 01:20:51.365
When I said they manufactured a case,
you wanted nothing to do with it.

01:20:51.772 --> 01:20:53.728
Clearly, I changed my mind.

01:20:54.012 --> 01:20:55.570
On the basis of what?

01:20:55.972 --> 01:20:57.121
Instinct.

01:21:01.092 --> 01:21:03.401
If you don't like it,
you can always come home.

01:21:03.492 --> 01:21:04.720
I wanna go.

01:21:05.132 --> 01:21:07.009
All my friends will be there.

01:21:07.652 --> 01:21:08.971
I'll be okay.

01:21:13.052 --> 01:21:14.849
Come here. Sit down.

01:21:16.772 --> 01:21:19.491
Look, I'm accused of doing something
I didn't do.

01:21:20.132 --> 01:21:23.488
This trial is gonna give me a chance
to clear myself.

01:21:24.172 --> 01:21:26.288
-That's what's gonna happen.
-Of course.

01:21:26.372 --> 01:21:27.521
Of course.

01:21:28.692 --> 01:21:31.081
Here are the postcards. Use them.

01:21:31.212 --> 01:21:33.442
-Don't forget to write.
-They make me.

01:21:33.932 --> 01:21:35.285
What about me?

01:21:45.572 --> 01:21:47.085
Did Mr. Sabich ever tell you...

01:21:47.172 --> 01:21:50.130
...he had a personal relationship
with Ms. Polhemus?

01:21:50.652 --> 01:21:51.607
No.

01:21:52.052 --> 01:21:53.644
Did Mr. Sabich, at any time...

01:21:53.732 --> 01:21:57.407
...order you not to get phone records
of calls from his home?

01:21:57.532 --> 01:21:59.841
He never ordered me. He asked me.

01:22:00.012 --> 01:22:02.480
He asked you not to get those records?

01:22:02.812 --> 01:22:03.881
Did you oblige him?

01:22:03.972 --> 01:22:06.964
I was taken off the case
before I got to those records.

01:22:07.092 --> 01:22:09.686
-You did or did not get those records?
-I did not.

01:22:09.772 --> 01:22:12.764
We had a lot of higher-priority items
on our mind.

01:22:14.452 --> 01:22:15.851
A high-priority item...

01:22:15.932 --> 01:22:20.210
...was the analysis of fingerprints found
in Ms. Polhemus's apartment.

01:22:20.492 --> 01:22:22.448
Who talked with the Fingerprint Lab?

01:22:22.532 --> 01:22:23.601
Mr. Sabich.

01:22:23.692 --> 01:22:25.569
Did you ask him to expedite the reports?

01:22:25.652 --> 01:22:26.687
Yes, sir, I did.

01:22:26.772 --> 01:22:28.967
What did he say, if anything?

01:22:29.612 --> 01:22:30.931
He said he forgot.

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:32.286
He forgot?

01:22:35.412 --> 01:22:36.845
Rusty forgot.

01:22:37.892 --> 01:22:40.964
Would it be fair to say the two of you,
by working together...

01:22:41.052 --> 01:22:43.282
...have formed a personal friendship?

01:22:43.852 --> 01:22:45.365
I suppose so, yes.

01:22:45.692 --> 01:22:47.250
Were you assigned initially?

01:22:47.332 --> 01:22:49.892
Harold Greer initially handled the case.

01:22:51.132 --> 01:22:53.282
Has Mr. Sabich ever expressed to you...

01:22:53.372 --> 01:22:56.284
...any reservations about
Harold Greer's abilities?

01:22:56.532 --> 01:23:00.002
Everybody that I know thinks
of Harold Greer as a top-grade cop.

01:23:00.252 --> 01:23:04.211
Do you know who decided to replace
Harold Greer and bring you on this case?

01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:05.645
Mr. Sabich.

01:23:07.972 --> 01:23:09.200
Do you feel....

01:23:09.292 --> 01:23:10.327
Withdrawn.

01:23:10.812 --> 01:23:14.566
To your knowledge, does the defendant
have a closer personal relationship...

01:23:14.652 --> 01:23:17.962
...with anyone on the police force
than he does with you?

01:23:18.492 --> 01:23:20.323
Not that he's mentioned, no.

01:23:20.812 --> 01:23:22.848
So it's fair to say, Detective...

01:23:22.932 --> 01:23:27.369
...that you are the police officer
least likely to suspect him of murder.

01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:30.680
I would never believe that. Never.

01:23:31.172 --> 01:23:33.288
Thank you for your cooperation
and answering...

01:23:33.372 --> 01:23:36.682
...what must have been painful
and difficult questions for you...

01:23:36.772 --> 01:23:39.366
...considering your relationship
to the defendant.

01:23:39.452 --> 01:23:40.726
Nothing further.

01:23:44.132 --> 01:23:46.851
You made reference to a theory
you were developing that...

01:23:46.932 --> 01:23:49.969
...Ms. Polhemus might have been
the victim of a revenge killer.

01:23:50.052 --> 01:23:51.804
Someone she had once sent to jail.

01:23:51.892 --> 01:23:55.328
Yes, sir. We thought of that
as our most likely case.

01:23:55.732 --> 01:23:57.962
To identify possible suspects...

01:23:58.412 --> 01:24:02.849
...you reviewed cases she had prosecuted,
and was currently prosecuting...

01:24:03.012 --> 01:24:04.843
...going back several years? Correct?

01:24:04.932 --> 01:24:06.001
Yes, sir.

01:24:06.252 --> 01:24:08.243
Were you able to find all those files?

01:24:08.332 --> 01:24:10.243
No, sir. A file was missing.

01:24:10.812 --> 01:24:13.087
This is the so-called B file...

01:24:13.412 --> 01:24:15.801
...that was withheld
from you and Mr. Sabich...

01:24:15.892 --> 01:24:19.202
...until Mr. Sabich requested it personally
from Mr. Horgan?

01:24:19.492 --> 01:24:20.481
Yes, sir.

01:24:20.572 --> 01:24:22.210
It involved allegations--

01:24:22.292 --> 01:24:23.645
Let's move on.

01:24:24.652 --> 01:24:28.088
You've been warned about riding off
in all directions.

01:24:28.332 --> 01:24:29.811
No further questions.

01:24:30.412 --> 01:24:32.164
No redirect, Your Honor.

01:24:32.852 --> 01:24:35.605
We need subpoenas for Carolyn's doctors...

01:24:35.892 --> 01:24:37.644
...and for phone company records...

01:24:37.732 --> 01:24:39.529
...to check for errors.

01:24:39.852 --> 01:24:42.286
I don't think we need to bother with that.

01:24:43.132 --> 01:24:46.204
You said there was something wrong
with the phone records.

01:24:46.292 --> 01:24:49.329
That you never called Polhemus
the night of the murder.

01:24:51.852 --> 01:24:54.844
Jamie, I'd like a moment alone
with my client.

01:24:58.052 --> 01:24:59.405
-Sure.
-Thanks.

01:25:08.492 --> 01:25:11.404
I used to call Carolyn's apartment
after it was over.

01:25:13.532 --> 01:25:14.851
I'd call...

01:25:17.452 --> 01:25:18.931
...just to hear her voice.

01:25:19.012 --> 01:25:21.207
Then I'd hang up, like a goddamn kid.

01:25:24.252 --> 01:25:27.449
I'm not sure I called that night or not.
I don't remember.

01:25:29.652 --> 01:25:33.645
Contrary to my original hopes,
we will have to present a defense.

01:25:40.492 --> 01:25:42.084
My first instinct is...

01:25:42.252 --> 01:25:44.129
...to put Barbara on the witness stand.

01:25:44.212 --> 01:25:45.088
No.

01:25:45.172 --> 01:25:48.528
She's an attractive woman
and there are five men in the jury.

01:25:48.652 --> 01:25:51.450
She can also support your alibi
quite effectively.

01:25:51.532 --> 01:25:53.284
It's not negotiable, Sandy.

01:25:59.612 --> 01:26:01.330
When I was a prosecutor...

01:26:01.412 --> 01:26:05.485
...l always knew I had a winner
when the defendant refused to testify.

01:26:07.132 --> 01:26:09.123
All I want to do is to tell the truth.

01:26:09.212 --> 01:26:12.170
The jury wants to hear me say
I didn't do it.

01:26:12.332 --> 01:26:14.527
And that, you will do very well.

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:21.926
But with every word, you will confirm
what the prosecution is saying.

01:26:22.052 --> 01:26:24.486
That you were overwhelmed
with a sexual obsession...

01:26:24.572 --> 01:26:28.247
...that took a wrong turn into rage
when she ended the affair.

01:26:28.972 --> 01:26:33.204
You will have gone a long way
to eliminating the jury's reasonable doubt.

01:26:34.212 --> 01:26:36.123
The State offers as evidence...

01:26:36.612 --> 01:26:38.762
...from the defendant's suitcoat...

01:26:38.892 --> 01:26:42.567
...a hair identified by the Police Crime Lab
as that of the deceased.

01:26:42.652 --> 01:26:46.406
The skirt of the deceased contaminated
with fiber identified as Zorak V...

01:26:46.492 --> 01:26:49.484
...a carpet fabric found
in the home of the defendant.

01:26:50.212 --> 01:26:52.601
Chemist's identification of blood type...

01:26:52.772 --> 01:26:56.082
...and semen from the vagina
of the deceased as type A.

01:26:56.572 --> 01:26:59.166
Results of a blood test of Rozat Sabich...

01:26:59.252 --> 01:27:01.561
...identifying his as blood type A.

01:27:02.692 --> 01:27:06.651
The shirt of the deceased,
contaminated with the fiber Zorak V...

01:27:07.412 --> 01:27:10.006
...carpet fabric used
in the defendant's home.

01:27:14.052 --> 01:27:16.327
The State calls
Detective Morris Dickerman.

01:27:16.412 --> 01:27:18.482
This relates to missing evidence.

01:27:18.692 --> 01:27:20.762
I hope you're not considering
allowing them...

01:27:20.852 --> 01:27:24.162
...to proceed with the fingerprint evidence
in the absence of the glass.

01:27:24.252 --> 01:27:27.403
If so, we would like to be heard
on that question.

01:27:27.972 --> 01:27:29.564
I understand that.

01:27:29.932 --> 01:27:33.049
You may want to do some research
into this issue.

01:27:33.732 --> 01:27:37.202
You hit the books tonight
and I'll listen to you tomorrow.

01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:39.644
And if I were you...

01:27:40.012 --> 01:27:43.607
...l'd roll up my shirtsleeves
and go to the Evidence Room...

01:27:43.772 --> 01:27:45.603
...and find that glass.

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:48.612
You're not going to get any sleep again.

01:27:48.732 --> 01:27:52.247
That glass is the strongest piece
of physical evidence that I was there.

01:27:52.332 --> 01:27:57.167
If I can find solid precedents to keep it
out of evidence, their case will fail.

01:28:00.732 --> 01:28:03.690
Get something to eat
and don't drink too much coffee.

01:28:06.332 --> 01:28:07.481
Thanks.

01:28:07.572 --> 01:28:08.687
For what?

01:28:09.052 --> 01:28:10.644
For hanging in there.

01:28:12.412 --> 01:28:13.891
What did you expect?

01:28:27.812 --> 01:28:29.245
Yeah, just a sec.

01:28:31.492 --> 01:28:32.766
It's your uncle.

01:28:34.932 --> 01:28:36.047
My uncle?

01:28:42.852 --> 01:28:45.730
We got something
on that very important matter.

01:28:46.932 --> 01:28:48.809
I'm downstairs, in the lobby.

01:28:50.132 --> 01:28:52.851
We're working to keep the glass
out of evidence.

01:28:53.012 --> 01:28:55.082
Fuck the glass. I found Leon.

01:28:55.292 --> 01:28:57.408
Feature this. He's a Night Saint.

01:29:23.492 --> 01:29:24.447
Leon!

01:29:25.972 --> 01:29:27.564
Answer the door.

01:29:33.972 --> 01:29:36.122
Open up, Leon! It's the police!

01:29:36.692 --> 01:29:38.523
We just want to talk, Leon.

01:29:45.172 --> 01:29:46.366
On the floor!

01:29:48.132 --> 01:29:50.692
-Don't even breathe!
-What the fuck you doing?

01:29:54.692 --> 01:29:56.011
I'm Detective Lipranzer.

01:29:56.092 --> 01:29:58.811
This is Mr. Sabich
from the prosecutor's office.

01:29:58.932 --> 01:30:00.809
We have a few questions, Leon.

01:30:00.972 --> 01:30:03.884
If you're straight with us,
we're gone in five minutes.

01:30:03.972 --> 01:30:06.406
Five, six years ago,
you paid off a deputy PA...

01:30:06.492 --> 01:30:09.529
...$1 ,500 to make some trouble
you had go away.

01:30:10.092 --> 01:30:11.366
555-3469.

01:30:12.452 --> 01:30:14.204
Jack Friedman, you ask for.

01:30:18.532 --> 01:30:20.045
What the fuck he do that for?

01:30:20.132 --> 01:30:22.521
He wants your complete attention.

01:30:23.012 --> 01:30:27.483
Rusty Sabich is getting on the phone,
he will tell your present associates...

01:30:27.572 --> 01:30:32.123
...that five years ago you paid off a PA
to get off a rap on molesting an officer.

01:30:32.492 --> 01:30:33.481
To wit:

01:30:33.812 --> 01:30:37.248
Trying to get paid to suck his cock
in a public place.

01:30:38.412 --> 01:30:39.606
Now, Leon....

01:30:41.092 --> 01:30:43.606
How about five minutes of your time?

01:30:52.652 --> 01:30:54.404
This blonde bitch...

01:30:55.732 --> 01:30:58.121
...my probation officer, set it up.

01:30:59.652 --> 01:31:01.370
In the PA's office.

01:31:02.412 --> 01:31:04.243
Man standing behind me.

01:31:09.892 --> 01:31:12.281
And she be telling me, when I come in:

01:31:13.572 --> 01:31:15.483
"Just don't turn around.

01:31:16.772 --> 01:31:18.683
"Just do what the man say."

01:31:21.212 --> 01:31:22.361
He said:

01:31:25.732 --> 01:31:28.292
"Just leave the money in the top drawer."

01:31:31.092 --> 01:31:33.048
Fifteen hundred dollars.

01:31:34.372 --> 01:31:35.964
You never saw him?

01:31:36.772 --> 01:31:38.683
But he knows who it was.

01:31:46.972 --> 01:31:48.610
Judge Motherfucker.

01:31:51.172 --> 01:31:53.083
That's what we all call him.

01:31:56.572 --> 01:31:58.051
Larren Lyttle.

01:32:00.692 --> 01:32:02.569
I bet Larren was porking her...

01:32:02.652 --> 01:32:05.246
...and taking the money
to keep her in style.

01:32:06.692 --> 01:32:08.728
Sometimes I hate being a cop.

01:32:12.572 --> 01:32:15.689
Sorry, pal. You were counting
on it being Molto.

01:32:20.852 --> 01:32:24.891
If you leak this stuff we got on him
to Larren, he might dismiss your case.

01:32:30.332 --> 01:32:32.402
Okay, it was just a thought.

01:32:34.892 --> 01:32:35.847
All rise!

01:32:35.932 --> 01:32:38.969
This court is in session.
Judge Larren Lyttle presiding.

01:32:45.452 --> 01:32:46.805
Where's Kemp?

01:32:47.332 --> 01:32:51.928
We just received the medical examiner's
files on the reports from her doctors.

01:32:52.092 --> 01:32:54.003
He's going over them right now.

01:32:54.092 --> 01:32:57.209
We may have a surprise
in the medical testimony.

01:32:59.772 --> 01:33:02.491
Mr. Molto, you have completed
your search?

01:33:08.452 --> 01:33:09.851
Your Honor...

01:33:10.052 --> 01:33:13.010
...the police have not been able
to locate the glass.

01:33:13.252 --> 01:33:14.321
All right.

01:33:14.812 --> 01:33:17.201
Mr. Stern, I have studied your arguments.

01:33:17.732 --> 01:33:21.088
You are about to hear the testimony
of a fingerprint expert...

01:33:21.212 --> 01:33:25.330
...concerning evidence that he claims
to have identified on a certain glass.

01:33:26.292 --> 01:33:30.888
I am instructing you as a matter of law
that you are entitled to consider...

01:33:31.172 --> 01:33:35.450
...the prosecution's failure to make
the glass available to the defense.

01:33:35.772 --> 01:33:37.808
I am not telling you what to do.

01:33:38.332 --> 01:33:40.892
But it is permissible
for that one fact alone...

01:33:40.972 --> 01:33:45.329
...to raise a reasonable doubt
that would require Mr. Sabich's acquittal.

01:33:46.612 --> 01:33:48.762
Mr. Stern's objection is overruled.

01:33:49.452 --> 01:33:52.046
His exception is noted for the record.
Proceed.

01:33:52.572 --> 01:33:53.641
I'm sorry.

01:33:54.612 --> 01:33:56.409
He's right, under the law.

01:33:57.172 --> 01:34:01.006
Based on the lateral slash
on the anterior portion of the fingerprint...

01:34:01.292 --> 01:34:03.408
...the distinctive center whorl...

01:34:03.772 --> 01:34:06.445
...and the exact match on the top swirl...

01:34:07.412 --> 01:34:11.849
...l am certain the fingerprint on the glass
from Polhemus's apartment...

01:34:12.692 --> 01:34:16.731
...is identical to that contained in
the employment file of Rozat K. Sabich.

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:18.687
Very good.

01:34:19.932 --> 01:34:22.810
We are calling Dr. Kumagai,
the county coroner.

01:34:23.132 --> 01:34:25.168
There are three depression fractures...

01:34:25.252 --> 01:34:28.722
...like from a heavy, blunt instrument.
Maybe a hammer.

01:34:29.372 --> 01:34:31.283
Here...here...and here.

01:34:33.052 --> 01:34:34.883
This, and this over here, are...

01:34:34.972 --> 01:34:38.328
...sharp, deep penetrations
of the skull and of the brain...

01:34:38.452 --> 01:34:41.569
...like with a hatchet, or maybe
a meat cleaver.

01:34:42.092 --> 01:34:46.165
I call to your attention the results
of the forensic chemist's analysis...

01:34:46.612 --> 01:34:48.125
...State's exhibit 63.

01:34:52.012 --> 01:34:54.572
I think we might just nail this sucker.

01:34:54.772 --> 01:34:59.129
That report states the specimen of semen
taken from Ms. Polhemus's body...

01:34:59.812 --> 01:35:03.487
...has been identified as being
of Mr. Sabich's blood type.

01:35:03.692 --> 01:35:04.966
You are correct.

01:35:05.372 --> 01:35:08.364
It also indicates the presence
of chemicals...

01:35:08.692 --> 01:35:09.966
...consistent...

01:35:10.132 --> 01:35:12.726
...with the use of a birth-control device.

01:35:13.612 --> 01:35:14.840
A diaphragm.

01:35:15.452 --> 01:35:16.487
It does.

01:35:18.012 --> 01:35:20.082
Your opinion is that this was...

01:35:20.492 --> 01:35:21.845
...a staged rape?

01:35:21.932 --> 01:35:23.604
That is my opinion.

01:35:24.412 --> 01:35:26.084
And the way it was done...

01:35:26.252 --> 01:35:27.526
...suggests...

01:35:28.412 --> 01:35:29.925
...the knowledge...

01:35:30.292 --> 01:35:32.442
...of investigative techniques?

01:35:33.412 --> 01:35:35.607
That's what I told Mr. Molto.

01:35:36.732 --> 01:35:38.962
All of these deductions depend...

01:35:39.372 --> 01:35:41.966
...on the presence of spermicidal jelly...

01:35:42.252 --> 01:35:45.369
...in the specimen you sent
to the forensic chemist?

01:35:45.492 --> 01:35:46.641
Yes, sir.

01:35:47.972 --> 01:35:51.282
How many autopsies do you perform
in a week, Dr. Kumagai?

01:35:52.332 --> 01:35:53.560
One, two...

01:35:54.212 --> 01:35:55.850
...ten. It all depends.

01:35:56.452 --> 01:36:00.127
Would it surprise you to know
you performed 1 8 autopsies...

01:36:00.292 --> 01:36:03.443
...in the two weeks surrounding
Carolyn Polhemus's death?

01:36:03.652 --> 01:36:04.721
No, sir.

01:36:05.652 --> 01:36:07.244
Sounds about right.

01:36:08.252 --> 01:36:11.289
Given that number,
isn't it fair to say that...

01:36:11.732 --> 01:36:14.963
...the specifics of any one examination
may slip your mind?

01:36:16.732 --> 01:36:19.121
I take notes while I do the autopsies.

01:36:19.612 --> 01:36:20.840
Notes, yes.

01:36:22.332 --> 01:36:25.005
These notes led you
to tell Detective Lipranzer...

01:36:25.092 --> 01:36:27.128
...that the murderer was sterile?

01:36:27.612 --> 01:36:30.285
Looking back, you must have thought
you were a fool...

01:36:30.372 --> 01:36:34.809
...to have escaped something so obvious
as the use of a contraceptive spermicide.

01:36:36.092 --> 01:36:38.048
All the sperm were dead.

01:36:39.292 --> 01:36:43.604
I didn't have the forensic chemist's report
about the spermicidal jelly.

01:36:43.772 --> 01:36:48.084
In the absence of any other explanation,
I thought the guy was sterile.

01:36:50.492 --> 01:36:54.007
Do you recognize your notes
of your autopsy of Ms. Polhemus?

01:36:56.452 --> 01:36:58.329
Yes, sir, my signature.

01:37:03.132 --> 01:37:05.088
Unless there is any objection...

01:37:05.172 --> 01:37:08.960
...would you please read the short passage
marked by the paper clips?

01:37:10.012 --> 01:37:11.604
Page two, Counsel.

01:37:12.252 --> 01:37:13.844
Read it out loud, please.

01:37:13.932 --> 01:37:15.843
"The Fallopian tubes...

01:37:16.052 --> 01:37:18.008
"...are ligated and separated.

01:37:18.452 --> 01:37:20.682
"The fimbriated ends appear...."

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:35.445
That's not right.

01:37:35.772 --> 01:37:37.251
Your own autopsy notes?

01:37:37.332 --> 01:37:40.210
You dictate them
as you perform the procedure.

01:37:45.092 --> 01:37:46.047
But not right.

01:37:46.132 --> 01:37:49.568
I show you the records of Dr. Lubin,
a gynecologist...

01:37:49.932 --> 01:37:54.050
...who performed this procedure
on Ms. Polhemus six and a half years ago.

01:37:56.412 --> 01:37:59.882
Would you explain to the jury
what a "tubal ligation" is?

01:38:05.092 --> 01:38:07.686
Would you explain, in layman's language...

01:38:08.092 --> 01:38:10.003
...what a "tubal ligation" is?

01:38:19.332 --> 01:38:21.243
She had her tubes tied.

01:38:23.492 --> 01:38:27.246
Is it possible for a woman
with this procedure to conceive a child?

01:38:28.612 --> 01:38:29.408
No way.

01:38:29.492 --> 01:38:31.403
Can you think of any reason...

01:38:31.812 --> 01:38:34.406
...for a woman who had her tubes tied...

01:38:34.772 --> 01:38:36.490
...to use a spermicide?

01:38:38.732 --> 01:38:40.051
No reason.

01:38:40.852 --> 01:38:42.444
No medical reason.

01:38:43.932 --> 01:38:45.001
I think of nothing.

01:38:45.092 --> 01:38:47.731
Does it not follow, given these facts...

01:38:47.892 --> 01:38:50.406
...that the specimen you sent
to the chemist...

01:38:50.492 --> 01:38:53.450
...was not taken from the body
of Carolyn Polhemus?

01:38:54.692 --> 01:38:56.603
I can't account for it.

01:38:59.412 --> 01:39:01.403
So you don't know what happened.

01:39:03.332 --> 01:39:06.324
Wherever you got
that specimen from, Doctor...

01:39:07.252 --> 01:39:09.083
...you sent it to the chemist...

01:39:09.172 --> 01:39:12.130
...while you were secretly communicating
with Mr. Molto...

01:39:12.212 --> 01:39:14.123
...behind Mr. Sabich's back. Am I right?

01:39:14.212 --> 01:39:16.362
Do you accuse me, Mr. Stern?

01:39:17.572 --> 01:39:19.085
Sit down, Doctor.

01:39:21.332 --> 01:39:23.129
I think we have had enough...

01:39:23.212 --> 01:39:26.045
...unsupported accusations for one case...

01:39:28.972 --> 01:39:30.451
...Dr. Kumagai.

01:39:31.332 --> 01:39:33.050
You may step down, Doctor.

01:39:33.772 --> 01:39:37.208
Do I take it, Mr. Delay Guardia,
that the State rests?

01:39:41.652 --> 01:39:43.244
Judge, may we approach?

01:39:50.412 --> 01:39:52.687
We would like Mr. Molto to testify.

01:39:52.932 --> 01:39:53.887
No.

01:39:53.972 --> 01:39:56.850
Judge, you said we would be entitled
to some leeway...

01:39:56.932 --> 01:39:59.924
...if the defense proceeded
with this frame-up theory.

01:40:00.012 --> 01:40:02.765
Yes, but I did not know then,
Mr. Della Guardia...

01:40:02.892 --> 01:40:07.408
...that your evidence would disappear
after last being seen with Mr. Molto.

01:40:07.532 --> 01:40:09.409
I didn't know that Mr. Molto...

01:40:09.492 --> 01:40:12.484
...and the chief pathologist
would manufacture evidence...

01:40:12.572 --> 01:40:14.085
...and testimony.

01:40:14.172 --> 01:40:18.051
And I tell you, that is a fair interpretation
of the day's events.

01:40:18.172 --> 01:40:21.369
I'm still considering the question
of what happens to Mr. Molto...

01:40:21.452 --> 01:40:23.044
...but what isn't gonna happen...

01:40:23.132 --> 01:40:26.249
...is him getting up on the witness stand
and making matters worse.

01:40:26.332 --> 01:40:28.084
Withdraw, gentlemen.

01:40:33.652 --> 01:40:36.803
On behalf of the people
of Kindle County, the State rests.

01:40:37.772 --> 01:40:39.490
This court is adjourned.

01:40:39.812 --> 01:40:43.771
You should savor today, Sandy.
No lawyer gets many crosses like that.

01:40:43.932 --> 01:40:45.809
What a colossal blunder.

01:40:47.132 --> 01:40:49.805
Tomorrow I will make the motion
for a dismissal.

01:40:49.892 --> 01:40:53.931
If the dismissal is not granted,
we must proceed with the defense.

01:40:55.572 --> 01:40:58.609
I need to know
if you still insist on testifying.

01:41:00.212 --> 01:41:02.009
Of course, you know my strong objections.

01:41:04.772 --> 01:41:07.240
Why is he so against your testifying?

01:41:07.772 --> 01:41:11.321
He's afraid I'll tell the truth
about my relationship with Carolyn...

01:41:11.412 --> 01:41:14.848
...thus giving the prosecution
the motive they've been lacking.

01:41:15.972 --> 01:41:17.405
One could argue...

01:41:18.492 --> 01:41:21.802
...if the jury feels I'm being truthful
about something so painful...

01:41:21.892 --> 01:41:25.487
...they should believe me when I say
I didn't commit the murder.

01:41:27.332 --> 01:41:28.845
What would you think?

01:41:29.972 --> 01:41:32.042
If I were a member of the jury?

01:41:36.452 --> 01:41:39.171
And I heard you admit
how much she meant to you?

01:41:42.932 --> 01:41:45.241
I think I'd conclude you were guilty.

01:41:49.892 --> 01:41:51.405
I want to testify.

01:41:54.012 --> 01:41:55.570
What would you say?

01:42:00.012 --> 01:42:02.606
I'd say you were the only man I ever loved.

01:42:05.012 --> 01:42:06.445
And I still do.

01:42:09.372 --> 01:42:12.284
Before we begin our presentation,
I would like to--

01:42:12.412 --> 01:42:14.368
Make a motion for dismissal?

01:42:14.812 --> 01:42:15.801
Yes, Your Honor.

01:42:15.892 --> 01:42:17.530
Sit down, Counselor.

01:42:22.252 --> 01:42:25.722
I have reflected on this case at length,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:42:27.732 --> 01:42:29.165
I understand...

01:42:29.372 --> 01:42:31.840
...the prosecutors have suspicions.

01:42:33.492 --> 01:42:36.052
Perhaps Mr. Sabich was there that night.

01:42:36.532 --> 01:42:38.648
The State might be granted that.

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:42.003
And if the prosecutors
had ever found that glass...

01:42:42.612 --> 01:42:44.682
...l might be more convinced.

01:42:45.012 --> 01:42:46.764
Maybe before yesterday...

01:42:47.372 --> 01:42:51.445
...l might have said there were
reasonable grounds for those suspicions.

01:42:51.612 --> 01:42:53.603
But now, I'm not so sure.

01:42:56.532 --> 01:42:58.284
So after yesterday...

01:42:58.932 --> 01:43:01.241
...there is no proof of motive here.

01:43:01.532 --> 01:43:05.969
There is no concrete evidence that
there ever was an intimate relationship.

01:43:06.572 --> 01:43:09.132
There is no effective proof,
so far as I am concerned...

01:43:09.212 --> 01:43:12.841
...that would give a reasonable person
grounds to believe that...

01:43:13.132 --> 01:43:17.887
...Mr. Sabich had carnal relations with
Ms. Polhemus on the night of her death.

01:43:18.732 --> 01:43:20.165
In point of fact...

01:43:20.372 --> 01:43:23.091
...there's not one shred of direct proof...

01:43:23.332 --> 01:43:26.085
...that Mr. Sabich murdered Ms. Polhemus.

01:43:28.532 --> 01:43:30.284
Under these circumstances...

01:43:30.372 --> 01:43:32.761
...l cannot allow this trial to continue.

01:43:34.292 --> 01:43:35.486
Mr. Sabich...

01:43:36.612 --> 01:43:38.443
...you are discharged, sir.

01:43:40.332 --> 01:43:43.290
I cannot begin to tell you how sorry I am...

01:43:43.412 --> 01:43:45.642
...that any of this has taken place.

01:43:47.092 --> 01:43:49.811
Not even the pleasure of seeing you free...

01:43:49.972 --> 01:43:51.371
...can make up for this...

01:43:51.452 --> 01:43:54.046
...this disgrace to the cause of justice.

01:43:55.412 --> 01:43:57.164
I wish you Godspeed.

01:43:59.332 --> 01:44:00.811
Case dismissed.

01:44:13.252 --> 01:44:14.731
Hey, Rusty! Come on.

01:44:15.092 --> 01:44:16.810
Give the missus a big hug.

01:44:21.652 --> 01:44:24.644
Nobody can say anything adequate
at a time like this.

01:44:24.732 --> 01:44:27.451
We're very grateful,
very pleased it's all over.

01:44:28.172 --> 01:44:29.685
I want to go home, now.

01:44:29.772 --> 01:44:32.332
I'll talk to Nat. I'll phone him, tell him.

01:44:33.252 --> 01:44:36.403
For the record, I have the highest regard
for Rusty Sabich.

01:44:36.492 --> 01:44:38.722
You think you're out of a job?

01:44:41.452 --> 01:44:42.965
You're the very best.

01:44:48.292 --> 01:44:51.489
How'd you know what was behind
Larren's fear of the B file?

01:44:52.332 --> 01:44:54.687
You question the judge's integrity?

01:44:55.492 --> 01:44:57.608
With just cause, wouldn't you say?

01:44:58.052 --> 01:45:01.488
You knew that file didn't have
a damn thing to do with my case.

01:45:01.892 --> 01:45:05.441
Yet you let Larren know you'd drag it in
at any opportunity.

01:45:05.732 --> 01:45:08.087
That it would come out
that he was taking bribes.

01:45:08.172 --> 01:45:10.208
That Carolyn was the courier.

01:45:12.932 --> 01:45:14.684
You blackmailed him, Sandy.

01:45:19.492 --> 01:45:21.084
We speak now tonight...

01:45:22.892 --> 01:45:25.486
...and these things
are never spoken of again.

01:45:26.852 --> 01:45:27.841
Agreed?

01:45:31.812 --> 01:45:34.690
Larren's divorce left him
in a state of disorder.

01:45:35.652 --> 01:45:40.328
He was drinking too heavily and fell
into a relationship with a beautiful, but...

01:45:40.612 --> 01:45:42.204
...self-serving woman.

01:45:43.972 --> 01:45:45.121
The fact is...

01:45:45.212 --> 01:45:48.124
...Larren himself grew suicidally depressed.

01:45:48.972 --> 01:45:51.327
He wanted to resign from the bench.

01:45:51.532 --> 01:45:53.887
Raymond Horgan talked him out of it.

01:45:54.212 --> 01:45:56.282
Raymond knew he was taking bribes?

01:45:57.092 --> 01:45:58.684
Larren told him.

01:46:00.612 --> 01:46:03.809
Raymond cleaned up the Northside,
as you recall...

01:46:04.812 --> 01:46:07.531
...and he also rescued
a distinguished mind...

01:46:07.692 --> 01:46:10.365
...and a career that does honor
to the bench.

01:46:15.212 --> 01:46:18.522
I believe Larren today did
what he thought was just.

01:46:20.932 --> 01:46:22.524
You tell me, Rusty.

01:46:24.172 --> 01:46:25.764
Was justice done?

01:46:35.052 --> 01:46:36.485
How are you doing?

01:46:45.132 --> 01:46:46.645
Christmas present.

01:47:00.292 --> 01:47:01.361
Jesus....

01:47:04.172 --> 01:47:07.209
You're hanging your ass out
a good long way on this one.

01:47:07.692 --> 01:47:09.603
It was them that fucked up.

01:47:10.332 --> 01:47:13.529
Remember, they came around,
they grabbed all the evidence.

01:47:13.852 --> 01:47:16.730
The glass wasn't there.
I took it down to Dickerman.

01:47:17.652 --> 01:47:20.086
The very next day I get a call from the lab.

01:47:20.172 --> 01:47:22.732
The test is done. I can pick up my glass.

01:47:23.772 --> 01:47:28.163
When I went down there, Molto had signed
a receipt, "Returned to Evidence."

01:47:28.732 --> 01:47:31.371
The idea was that I'll put it back in.

01:47:32.092 --> 01:47:34.367
Only I got nowhere to put it...

01:47:34.892 --> 01:47:37.531
...since it ain't my goddamn case anymore.

01:47:39.292 --> 01:47:41.442
So I tossed the thing in my drawer.

01:47:42.092 --> 01:47:45.050
I figured, sooner or later
somebody's got to ask me.

01:47:46.412 --> 01:47:47.606
Nobody did.

01:47:48.572 --> 01:47:50.164
You think I killed her.

01:47:53.132 --> 01:47:54.804
The lady was bad news.

01:47:59.292 --> 01:48:01.283
That makes it okay I killed her?

01:48:01.372 --> 01:48:02.600
Did you?

01:48:05.092 --> 01:48:06.161
Oh, pal.

01:48:28.652 --> 01:48:29.482
Nat!

01:48:30.572 --> 01:48:31.846
Where's Mom?

01:48:32.012 --> 01:48:34.480
Upstairs in the bathroom
throwing up when I saw her.

01:48:34.572 --> 01:48:36.802
She's got her university interview today.

01:48:36.892 --> 01:48:38.166
What's the big deal?

01:48:38.252 --> 01:48:39.844
No eggs for me, thank you.

01:48:39.932 --> 01:48:41.206
That looks nice.

01:48:41.292 --> 01:48:42.407
You think?

01:48:42.732 --> 01:48:46.088
That dumb old college would be lucky
to have you teaching there.

01:48:46.172 --> 01:48:47.525
You tell her, kid.

01:48:48.412 --> 01:48:51.484
I'll do some work around the house
while I still have time.

01:48:51.572 --> 01:48:53.130
I've lived to see the day.

01:48:53.212 --> 01:48:55.601
Give me a hand with the fence
when you get home.

01:48:55.692 --> 01:48:57.444
I can't. I got a game after school.

01:48:57.532 --> 01:48:58.760
Good luck, Mom.

01:49:07.532 --> 01:49:08.885
Go get them, kid.

01:51:07.212 --> 01:51:08.486
I did it.

01:51:14.932 --> 01:51:16.604
I fooled them all.

01:51:19.692 --> 01:51:21.011
The interview.

01:51:22.212 --> 01:51:24.203
They think I'm qualified.

01:52:27.972 --> 01:52:30.532
You understand what happened
had to happen.

01:52:32.572 --> 01:52:35.006
It couldn't have turned out any other way.

01:52:37.852 --> 01:52:39.683
A woman's depressed...

01:52:41.612 --> 01:52:43.011
...with herself...

01:52:44.132 --> 01:52:45.485
...with life...

01:52:47.172 --> 01:52:50.847
...with her husband, who had made life
possible for her until he was...

01:52:50.932 --> 01:52:53.127
...bewitched by another woman.

01:52:54.852 --> 01:52:56.251
A destroyer.

01:53:01.172 --> 01:53:02.571
Abandoned...

01:53:05.652 --> 01:53:07.722
...like someone left for dead...

01:53:09.412 --> 01:53:11.403
...she plans her suicide.

01:53:14.852 --> 01:53:16.763
Until the dream begins.

01:53:18.732 --> 01:53:21.405
In the dream, the destroyer's destroyed.

01:53:22.772 --> 01:53:24.842
That's a dream worth living for.

01:53:29.652 --> 01:53:31.608
Now, with such simplicity...

01:53:35.252 --> 01:53:38.244
...such clarity, everything falls into place.

01:53:41.732 --> 01:53:43.529
It must be a crime...

01:53:43.932 --> 01:53:48.210
...that her husband can declare unsolved
and be believed by all the world.

01:53:49.212 --> 01:53:51.487
She must make it look like a rape.

01:53:53.052 --> 01:53:55.646
But she must leave her husband clueless.

01:53:56.132 --> 01:53:58.407
Once he discovers who it was...

01:53:59.772 --> 01:54:03.082
...he'll put the case into the file
of the unsolved murders.

01:54:04.812 --> 01:54:06.723
Another break-in by some...

01:54:07.252 --> 01:54:08.844
...sex-crazed man.

01:54:13.772 --> 01:54:15.251
But all his life...

01:54:16.812 --> 01:54:18.848
...he'll know that it was her.

01:54:23.612 --> 01:54:26.365
She remembers a set of glasses
she bought for the woman...

01:54:26.452 --> 01:54:30.889
...some time before, a housewarming gift
from her husband and his office.

01:54:31.372 --> 01:54:33.090
She buys another set.

01:54:34.372 --> 01:54:36.840
Her husband has a beer one night...

01:54:39.052 --> 01:54:41.282
...doesn't even comment on the glass.

01:54:42.412 --> 01:54:44.289
Now she has his fingerprints.

01:54:48.652 --> 01:54:50.643
Then on a few mornings...

01:54:52.132 --> 01:54:56.045
...she saves the fluid that comes out
when she removes her diaphragm.

01:55:02.372 --> 01:55:04.283
Puts it in a plastic bag.

01:55:05.772 --> 01:55:08.081
Puts the bag in the basement freezer...

01:55:09.292 --> 01:55:10.520
...and waits.

01:55:13.332 --> 01:55:15.892
She calls the woman and asks to see her.

01:55:16.652 --> 01:55:19.610
Stops first at the U
and logs onto the computer.

01:55:19.892 --> 01:55:21.723
Now she has her alibi.

01:55:24.132 --> 01:55:25.963
She goes to the woman.

01:55:26.852 --> 01:55:28.683
The woman lets her in.

01:55:29.732 --> 01:55:34.123
When her head is turned, she removes
the instrument from her bag and strikes.

01:55:36.612 --> 01:55:38.443
The destroyer is destroyed.

01:55:41.932 --> 01:55:43.843
She takes a cord out...

01:55:45.772 --> 01:55:47.728
...that she brought along...

01:55:49.852 --> 01:55:51.570
...and ties her body...

01:55:52.132 --> 01:55:55.010
...in ways her husband described
perverts do.

01:55:57.972 --> 01:55:59.644
She feels power...

01:56:01.572 --> 01:56:02.925
...control...

01:56:04.772 --> 01:56:08.003
...a sense that she's guided
by a force beyond herself.

01:56:10.972 --> 01:56:14.760
Takes a syringe and injects
the contents of the Ziploc bag...

01:56:16.412 --> 01:56:18.482
...leaves the glass on the bar...

01:56:19.532 --> 01:56:21.841
...unlocks the door and windows...

01:56:24.132 --> 01:56:25.485
...and goes home.

01:56:29.532 --> 01:56:31.363
And life begins again.

01:56:37.852 --> 01:56:39.285
Until a trial...

01:56:42.292 --> 01:56:44.567
...when she sees her husband suffer...

01:56:45.852 --> 01:56:47.444
...the way she never...

01:56:48.492 --> 01:56:49.720
...intended.

01:56:52.412 --> 01:56:54.482
She is prepared to tell the truth.

01:56:55.732 --> 01:56:57.484
Right up to the very end.

01:57:01.012 --> 01:57:02.286
But magically...

01:57:04.972 --> 01:57:06.883
...the charges were dismissed.

01:57:10.252 --> 01:57:12.004
The suffering was over.

01:57:14.772 --> 01:57:16.251
They were saved.

01:57:22.492 --> 01:57:23.561
Saved?

01:57:32.692 --> 01:57:35.001
The murder of Carolyn Polhemus...

01:57:35.612 --> 01:57:37.364
...remains unsolved.

01:57:39.532 --> 01:57:43.764
It is a practical impossibility
to try two people for the same crime.

01:57:46.012 --> 01:57:47.764
Even if it wasn't...

01:57:49.092 --> 01:57:51.890
...l couldn't take his mother from my son.

01:57:54.372 --> 01:57:56.010
I'm a prosecutor.

01:57:56.372 --> 01:57:59.489
I have spent my life
in the assignment of blame.

01:58:01.572 --> 01:58:04.040
With all deliberation and intent...

01:58:04.732 --> 01:58:06.723
...l reached for Carolyn.

01:58:07.412 --> 01:58:09.562
I cannot pretend it was an accident.

01:58:11.692 --> 01:58:13.091
I reached for Carolyn...

01:58:13.172 --> 01:58:16.482
...and set off that insane mix
of rage and lunacy...

01:58:18.492 --> 01:58:21.006
...that led one human being to kill another.

01:58:23.972 --> 01:58:25.325
There was a crime.

01:58:27.292 --> 01:58:28.850
There was a victim.

01:58:31.252 --> 01:58:33.004
And there is punishment.
