WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.400
<i>Previously on Greek:</i>

00:01.410 --> 00:03.200
Look, I realize
this is awkward.

00:03.210 --> 00:05.400
You said you liked me,
and I didn't remember you.

00:05.410 --> 00:07.300
Then I asked you out,
and you blew me off.

00:07.310 --> 00:09.200
now I see
why it's awkward, for you.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.600
I convinced Rebecca to
come to our Valentine's party.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.170
I want to show the girl who
claims she doesn't believe in love

00:14.204 --> 00:15.471
how much she means to me.

00:15.505 --> 00:17.306
- Is that from Evan?
- I've decided I like it.

00:17.340 --> 00:18.974
He thinks he
has a future with you.

00:19.009 --> 00:20.543
Don't you think you're
giving Evan the wrong idea

00:20.577 --> 00:21.944
when you don't
feel the same way?

00:21.978 --> 00:23.345
I don't want to get
serious with him.

00:23.380 --> 00:25.915
- How about we go upstairs?
- Oh, my God!

00:25.949 --> 00:29.018
- What about law school? - I thought about
law school, but it was for a boyfriend.

00:29.052 --> 00:30.820
Maybe you should
consider it for yourself.

00:30.854 --> 00:34.457
If I get into CRU Law and
you find a major that you love

00:34.491 --> 00:36.792
then maybe we could end up
graduate at the same time.

00:36.827 --> 00:39.495
I'm just not sure I'm ready
to graduate and leave here.

00:39.529 --> 00:43.199
- What about you and Casey?
- I don't really know.

00:47.637 --> 00:51.640
Hmm. Morning.

00:51.675 --> 00:53.609
Good morning!

00:55.479 --> 00:57.379
Looks like you have
a new Jeremy on your hands.

00:57.414 --> 00:59.315
Right on time, Dumper.

01:00.951 --> 01:02.451
Mardi Gras breakfast beer?

01:02.486 --> 01:05.354
It has zero essential
vitamins and minerals.

01:05.388 --> 01:09.091
Right. Mardi Gras. I'd love to,
but I'm taking the LSAT today.

01:09.126 --> 01:11.260
Are you sure you need that
to get into law school?

01:11.294 --> 01:15.097
The Law School Admission Test?
Yes, I'm sure.

01:15.132 --> 01:17.099
- That will be all, Dumptruck.
- Thank you, sir.

01:17.134 --> 01:19.301
Aw. I remember when you were
a pledge you used to say,

01:19.336 --> 01:21.437
"One day, someone will
wake me up with beer."

01:21.471 --> 01:25.541
- It's as special as I'd hoped.
- We've come a long way.

01:25.575 --> 01:29.512
I'm taking the LSAT, you're
getting beer brought to you

01:29.546 --> 01:32.314
and declaring a major.
We're practically grown up.

01:32.349 --> 01:34.216
- Yep.
- So...

01:34.251 --> 01:37.520
...did you? Fill out your
major declaration form?

01:37.554 --> 01:40.322
- Uh... yes.
- Really?

01:40.357 --> 01:42.792
With three majors. I got so
excited I couldn't stop writing.

01:42.826 --> 01:45.461
At least you're narrowing
down the choices. What are they?

01:45.495 --> 01:48.230
Um, if I tell you,
then they won't come true.

01:48.265 --> 01:50.466
Cap, are you not taking
this seriously?

01:50.500 --> 01:54.069
I swear I am. But today
is about you and your test. OK?

01:54.104 --> 01:56.438
- How are you feeling about it?
- I'm taking your advice.

01:56.473 --> 01:58.140
I'm trying to clear my mind

01:58.175 --> 02:00.276
- and not think about it too much.
- Always worked for me.

02:00.310 --> 02:02.845
And then you can come by the
Mardi Gras Spectacular

02:02.879 --> 02:05.815
and forget all about it.
Speaking of Mardi Gras,

02:05.849 --> 02:08.317
- there's this tradition where...
- No way.

02:08.351 --> 02:10.619
It's time for the first
parade of the day!

02:10.654 --> 02:14.223
Go play with your friends.

02:18.628 --> 02:20.563
Oh, hey,
good luck on your test!

02:20.597 --> 02:24.333
- Remember, don't be nervous.
- I won't be.

02:31.608 --> 02:34.076
Rusty, we're working
in the lab later, right?

02:34.110 --> 02:36.412
Yeah, but I have to leave a
early to help Kappa Tau

02:36.446 --> 02:38.013
set up for our
Mardi Gras party.

02:38.048 --> 02:39.548
Right, your frat world.

02:39.583 --> 02:41.684
Here's hoping you have both
eyebrows in the morning.

02:41.718 --> 02:44.286
I will because I have
a date for the party.

02:44.321 --> 02:47.790
- I'm actually on my way to meet her.
- Oh, what's her name?

02:47.824 --> 02:50.259
Her name...
Wait a minute.

02:50.293 --> 02:52.027
Is this weird for us
to talk about this?

02:52.062 --> 02:54.830
- Why?
- Because of the whole nerd auction thing

02:54.865 --> 02:58.033
when you liked me and hated me
all in one conversation.

02:58.068 --> 03:00.736
We're past the
"will they/won't they" hump.

03:00.770 --> 03:03.806
Now we know we won't, it clears
a path for us to be friends.

03:03.840 --> 03:06.842
I guess. I've just never
had a girl friend before.

03:06.877 --> 03:10.412
- That doesn't surprise me.
- I mean a girl, pause, friend.

03:10.447 --> 03:12.248
That doesn't surprise me,
either.

03:12.282 --> 03:14.316
But you should
give it a try.

03:14.351 --> 03:17.519
Sure, why not?
OK, girl-pause-friend,

03:17.554 --> 03:19.622
I'm gonna introduce you
to my date.

03:19.656 --> 03:21.123
You can tell me
what you think.

03:21.157 --> 03:23.192
Let me guess.
Vapid sorority girl?

03:23.226 --> 03:26.662
No. Not exactly.
Hello, Katherine.

03:26.696 --> 03:28.397
Rusty, hi.

03:33.570 --> 03:36.405
<i>- Whatcha reading?
- The latest Franka comic strip.</i>

03:36.439 --> 03:38.908
She's a Dutch sleuth who takes
on the likes of shady businessmen

03:38.942 --> 03:41.310
- and pirates and smugglers.
- Ooh.

03:41.344 --> 03:43.545
I would share but the
humor doesn't translate.

03:45.181 --> 03:47.516
Katherine, this is Dana.

03:47.550 --> 03:51.453
She is my lab assistant on
my project. And my friend.

03:51.488 --> 03:55.057
- She's also a Space Plasma Physics major.
- Oh, good for you.

03:55.091 --> 03:57.493
Yeah, I'm fascinated with
the Kinetic Molecular Theory.

03:57.527 --> 03:59.728
- Oh! - So, Rusty, I picked
up some Mardi Gras masks.

03:59.763 --> 04:02.364
I wanted you to try them on to make sure
they don't overpower your small head.

04:02.399 --> 04:05.501
- Oh, thanks.
- OK.

04:05.535 --> 04:08.203
- What do you think?
- Well, she's not vapid.

04:08.238 --> 04:11.240
She's great! Great.

04:14.000 --> 04:19.000
Sync by fant0m
www.addic7ed.com

04:21.618 --> 04:23.152
There you are!

04:23.186 --> 04:25.287
Are you coming to Dobler's
for Mardi Gras tonight?

04:25.322 --> 04:27.756
Evan is going with Rebecca
and Pete is meeting me

04:27.791 --> 04:29.692
after he gets back from his
lacrosse game in Chicago.

04:29.726 --> 04:33.028
Don't you just love Mardi Gras?
It's the perfect holiday.

04:33.063 --> 04:35.064
It doesn't have the
added romantic pressure

04:35.098 --> 04:38.934
of Valentine's Day or the unflattering
color palette of St. Patty's Day.

04:38.969 --> 04:41.637
But sometimes you
have to take the LSAT.

04:41.671 --> 04:44.206
Oh, my God!
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.975
I'm blabbing on
about parties and boys

04:46.009 --> 04:47.710
when you've got the most
important test of your life.

04:47.744 --> 04:52.047
- Well, not of my life.
- No, you're right.

04:52.082 --> 04:56.185
So just relax. It's like any
other test, only four hours longer.

04:56.219 --> 05:00.022
Why the hell have I been designated
sober sister on Mardi Gras?

05:00.056 --> 05:03.325
Because you were the only person not
at the meeting when we did the vote.

05:03.360 --> 05:07.029
If your meetings weren't
so stupid, I might attend.

05:07.063 --> 05:12.067
Dale, you take such wonderful
care of us here at ZBZ.

05:12.102 --> 05:14.069
- Thank you.
- We would like to show our thanks

05:14.104 --> 05:17.873
by making you our honorary
ZBZ sober sister tonight.

05:17.907 --> 05:20.776
No can do. I'm going to the
KT Mardi Gras party tonight.

05:20.810 --> 05:23.212
But you don't drink.
Or have fun. What's the point?

05:23.246 --> 05:26.482
It's a perfect opportunity to show
people you can have fun without drinking.

05:26.516 --> 05:29.318
You saying that
makes me want to drink.

05:35.725 --> 05:37.993
I don't know why
I thought I could study here.

05:38.028 --> 05:39.561
No, but I made you
a study snack.

05:39.596 --> 05:42.231
A fish medley, with blueberries.
It's brain food.

05:44.434 --> 05:49.805
Thanks, but brain
is already full. Of knowledge.

05:49.839 --> 05:53.242
- Want me to put it in
a to-go box? - No, no.

05:55.478 --> 05:56.478
I'll eat it.

06:00.717 --> 06:03.052
Hey, Cap. So...

06:03.086 --> 06:06.121
We want to make this Mardi Gras
tradition called a king cake.

06:06.156 --> 06:08.690
You bake a plastic baby
into a cake,

06:08.725 --> 06:11.994
and whoever gets the slice
with it has a lucky year.

06:14.364 --> 06:15.898
- Do it.
- Yes!

06:17.200 --> 06:19.301
This is gonna be a great
Mardi Gras party.

06:19.335 --> 06:21.770
I know. First beads
and now cake.

06:21.805 --> 06:24.073
And I'm bringing
Katherine as my date.

06:26.676 --> 06:29.511
What? I like her. I know,
she's a little strange,

06:29.546 --> 06:32.614
but she's really pretty under
those head bands and pearls.

06:32.649 --> 06:35.184
Have a seat.
Come here.

06:37.053 --> 06:39.254
Spitter, do you know
what Mardi Gras is?

06:39.289 --> 06:41.757
It's French for Fat Tuesday
which is a culmination

06:41.791 --> 06:43.725
of a carnival period beginning
with the Twelfth Night.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.396
Wrong. It's a time when we try to get
girls to show us their boobs for beads!

06:47.430 --> 06:49.631
- I don't think Katherine's
that type of girl. - Exactly.

06:49.666 --> 06:52.101
Mardi Gras is about debauchery.
And sex.

06:52.135 --> 06:54.236
You only bring a girl if you
know there's going to be both.

06:54.270 --> 06:56.705
- That's why I'm bringing your sister.
- I got it.

06:56.739 --> 06:59.741
If you bring a date to this party, you
can't throw beads at any other girls.

06:59.776 --> 07:02.344
You don't want the first time
you see your date's snack trays

07:02.378 --> 07:04.213
to be the first time
everyone else sees them, too.

07:04.247 --> 07:07.116
I think Katherine
will really love this party.

07:07.150 --> 07:09.885
- She really likes jazz.
- Jazz?

07:12.188 --> 07:13.655
You don't deserve these.

07:21.865 --> 07:23.499
That necklace looks
great on you.

07:23.533 --> 07:25.934
- Are you trying to get me back upstairs?
- Yes.

07:28.338 --> 07:30.739
See you tonight.

07:30.773 --> 07:31.907
Cal!

07:33.343 --> 07:36.245
Look, I know you're pissed
at me. I don't blame you.

07:36.279 --> 07:38.280
But it's not gonna
happen again.

07:38.314 --> 07:40.048
I pawned my laptop
to pay back the house.

07:40.083 --> 07:42.484
Hmm. What are you
gonna pawn next?

07:42.519 --> 07:44.786
I'll just take on
some more work.

07:44.821 --> 07:48.290
That sucks.
I'm sorry.

07:48.324 --> 07:51.326
Thanks.
It's not that bad.

07:51.361 --> 07:53.829
I made 50 bucks
last night catering.

07:53.863 --> 07:55.230
I'm practically
rolling in it.

07:55.265 --> 07:59.201
Regardless, I just
wanted to apologize.

08:00.637 --> 08:03.572
- Cool?
- Yeah, cool.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:12.248 --> 08:14.850
Oh, gosh! Oh, goodness.

08:19.556 --> 08:22.591
- Need these?
- Joel! Hi.

08:22.625 --> 08:23.792
What are you
doing here?

08:23.826 --> 08:26.161
Standing around with napkins
waiting for a spill.

08:26.196 --> 08:30.098
- And getting coffee. - Well, you've
come to the right place for both.

08:30.133 --> 08:33.235
- Thanks.
- Oh, God, this book.

08:33.269 --> 08:35.837
For a while, this was
the bane of my existence.

08:35.871 --> 08:39.541
- How are your nerves?
- Um, you know, my mind is clear.

08:39.576 --> 08:42.244
Feeling calm, trying not
to think about it too much.

08:42.278 --> 08:46.448
That's impressive. I was such
a mess the week before the LSAT,

08:46.482 --> 08:47.783
I couldn't sleep
or eat for a week.

08:47.817 --> 08:50.953
Me either. People keep
telling me not to be nervous,

08:50.987 --> 08:53.522
and I'm trying to
take their advice.

08:53.556 --> 08:55.524
That'd be nice, but I
don't see how you could.

08:55.558 --> 08:58.060
You're about to take a test
that's the most important factor

08:58.094 --> 08:59.761
- in getting into law school.
- Exactly!

08:59.796 --> 09:01.863
- It's a really big deal!
- The biggest.

09:01.898 --> 09:05.000
So freak out now instead
of freaking out in the test.

09:05.034 --> 09:08.403
OK, because I've put all
of my eggs into one basket,

09:08.438 --> 09:10.739
and if I don't get into
law school then I have nothing.

09:10.773 --> 09:14.276
So, I am... I am
currently freaking out!

09:14.310 --> 09:19.014
- Good for you.
- Oh... my God.

09:19.048 --> 09:21.717
I was trying so hard
not to be nervous,

09:21.751 --> 09:22.884
it was making me nervous.

09:24.821 --> 09:27.689
- Thank you for the help.
- You're welcome. I gotta go.

09:29.892 --> 09:33.061
Another trick that helped
was having a lucky talisman.

09:33.096 --> 09:35.530
I had this sweatshirt I wore
the whole time I was studying.

09:35.565 --> 09:39.101
It got pretty gross at the end,
but it worked.

09:39.135 --> 09:40.469
Can I borrow it?

09:40.503 --> 09:42.070
You don't want to go
to law school that badly.

09:50.413 --> 09:51.680
Dana?

09:56.019 --> 09:58.520
- What are you doing?
- I'm seeing if you need any help.

09:58.554 --> 10:01.923
Yeah, I'm actually the assistant
and you're the roommate.

10:01.958 --> 10:03.091
What are you
doing here?

10:03.126 --> 10:04.526
Rusty said I could play
with his lab equipment.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.995
- Tell her. - We're leaving for
the KT party soon anyway.

10:07.030 --> 10:08.864
You can have the
whole place to yourself.

10:08.898 --> 10:10.999
- Right, your big date night.
- Date?

10:11.034 --> 10:13.035
Cappie didn't say anything
about a date. I don't have one

10:13.069 --> 10:15.804
since Retainer Girl left me
emotionally and physically scarred.

10:15.838 --> 10:17.439
Relax, you do not
need to bring a date.

10:18.541 --> 10:19.675
Apparently.

10:20.710 --> 10:23.445
- OK. That's a relief.
- You can take me.

10:23.479 --> 10:24.846
You want to go
to a fraternity party?

10:24.881 --> 10:26.982
Why not?
As long you don't mind.

10:27.016 --> 10:28.817
- Why would I mind?
- Great.

10:28.851 --> 10:31.820
Wait, hold on. I haven't
agreed to any of this.

10:31.854 --> 10:34.589
Don't I get a say?

10:34.624 --> 10:36.425
- Let me see your teeth.
- What?

10:36.459 --> 10:39.494
I want to make sure you don't
have any dangerous orthodontia.

10:40.963 --> 10:43.198
Let's see those chompers.
Come on.

10:43.232 --> 10:44.533
No.

10:46.502 --> 10:48.804
All right, fine.
I'll take you.

10:53.710 --> 10:55.977
Hey! What are you
doing here?

10:56.012 --> 10:58.847
I have a few last minute details
I wanted to discuss with you

10:58.881 --> 11:00.749
before this evening.
May we have the room?

11:00.783 --> 11:02.451
What?

11:02.485 --> 11:05.921
Oh! You're serious.

11:05.955 --> 11:10.025
- Totally. - Yeah, I have some
stuff outside I need to work on.

11:14.197 --> 11:17.332
- What's up?
- Well, I've spent a considerable amount

11:17.367 --> 11:19.835
of the last four years
focused on my future.

11:19.869 --> 11:23.004
- Yeah? - And now that I've
been accepted into law school,

11:23.039 --> 11:25.173
and I do not start my summer
internship for two months,

11:25.208 --> 11:27.309
I have a lot of time
on my hands.

11:27.343 --> 11:32.080
I think you are a great person, and
we've had one relatively successful date,

11:32.115 --> 11:33.715
and I do not want
to go to Yale a virgin,

11:33.750 --> 11:36.985
so I've decided to lose my
virginity to you. Tonight.

11:38.321 --> 11:41.790
If you're amenable.
- I-I'm flattered.

11:41.824 --> 11:44.226
But we haven't
even kissed yet.

11:44.260 --> 11:45.894
Or learned how to
greet each other.

11:45.928 --> 11:47.763
Clearly, we are
two very smart people.

11:47.797 --> 11:49.731
I am confident that
we can figure it out.

11:49.766 --> 11:52.434
Now, I don't have
any experience in the area,

11:52.468 --> 11:56.938
so I will defer the choice
of prophylactic over to you.

12:06.017 --> 12:07.551
OK, let's get
this keg in the truck.

12:07.585 --> 12:09.887
Remember, lift with your back
on the count of three.

12:09.921 --> 12:11.922
- One...
- ...two...

12:11.956 --> 12:13.123
...three!

12:14.359 --> 12:16.627
You got it? You got it?

12:20.365 --> 12:22.800
So, did you figure out that,
uh, Mardi Gras date problem?

12:22.834 --> 12:24.568
Uh, sort of.

12:26.738 --> 12:30.707
- Talk to you for a second?
Just a little thing. - Yeah. Sure.

12:32.644 --> 12:34.645
Katherine
wants to have sex.

12:34.679 --> 12:38.449
Hey! That's great!
Wait, with you, right?

12:38.483 --> 12:40.584
- Yeah, with me.
- Hey! That's great!

12:40.618 --> 12:43.687
You found the exception to the
"No Date On Mardi Gras" rule:

12:43.721 --> 12:45.088
the "Sure Thing
On Mardi Gras."

12:45.123 --> 12:47.791
Oh, yeah. Sure thing.
It's just that...

12:47.826 --> 12:49.660
- ...she's a virgin.
- Really?

12:49.694 --> 12:52.763
- Yeah.
- You know what? I actually get that.

12:52.797 --> 12:55.032
It's only our second date and
she already wants to have sex.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.701
If she's a virgin, is she gonna
want to get married by the third one?

12:57.735 --> 12:59.036
What is it with you
Cartwrights

12:59.070 --> 13:00.604
and your obsession
with the future?

13:00.638 --> 13:03.407
Look at it this way: Being here
at school is like Mardi Gras,

13:03.441 --> 13:05.342
and the rest of your life
is like Lent.

13:05.376 --> 13:07.744
You gotta get it all out
before you give it all up.

13:07.779 --> 13:10.113
But I've never been
anybody's first before.

13:10.148 --> 13:14.685
What if I "give it all up" and
I don't meet her expectations?

13:14.719 --> 13:17.254
Are you kidding me?
She's never done it before,

13:17.288 --> 13:20.123
so she has nothing
to compare it to.

13:20.158 --> 13:22.392
I've never thought
about it that way.

13:22.427 --> 13:25.462
Not only do I have a chance to be her
first, I'm guaranteed to be her best.

13:25.497 --> 13:27.798
You'd have to screw it up
pretty badly not to.

13:27.832 --> 13:30.501
- Real bad.
- Trust me, this is a good thing, OK?

13:30.535 --> 13:35.606
In fact, I have a little somethg
for you in honor of this occasion.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.940
You know,
not too long ago,

13:36.975 --> 13:38.976
you came into Kappa Tau
yourself a virgin,

13:39.010 --> 13:41.245
looking for that first
sexual experience.

13:41.279 --> 13:45.015
And here you are, passing that wisdom
on to some other fortunate soul.

13:46.684 --> 13:50.888
It's the circle of life.
The circle of sex life.

13:57.529 --> 13:58.629
Come on.

14:04.235 --> 14:06.003
Guess what I've got.

14:06.037 --> 14:08.505
- Uh, the new Mariah album?
- Better!

14:08.540 --> 14:12.242
Tickets to Mardi Gras, tonight,
Gentleman's Choice!

14:12.277 --> 14:14.878
Oh. So no Dobler's
with the rest of the house?

14:14.913 --> 14:17.114
No way. This is my
first gay holiday.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.082
OK, easy Captain Fabulous.

14:19.117 --> 14:21.151
Straight people
celebrate Mardi Gras, too.

14:21.185 --> 14:23.253
- Not like we do.
- Good point.

14:23.288 --> 14:26.056
While I was there,
I got a proposition.

14:26.090 --> 14:29.259
To bartend. Apparently they're
expecting such a huge crowd,

14:29.294 --> 14:30.561
they need extra help.

14:30.595 --> 14:33.330
I could make 500 dollars prancing
around without my shirt on.

14:33.364 --> 14:35.766
- Wait, did you say 500 dollars?
- Yeah.

14:35.800 --> 14:38.602
But instead I'm choosing
to prance around you

14:38.636 --> 14:42.272
- with my shirt off for nothing.
- Aw. That's sweet.

14:42.307 --> 14:44.041
But just so you know,
I'm gonna keep my shirt on.

14:44.075 --> 14:46.476
OK. But no pants.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.685
Hey, I thought you were
off taking your test.

14:54.719 --> 14:57.721
Uh, I need a
lucky charm for the LSAT.

14:57.755 --> 14:59.856
I was going to bring
Pussy-Willow the Seventh,

14:59.891 --> 15:01.358
but that seemed
unprofessional,

15:01.392 --> 15:04.161
so I'm going with the purple
hair tie I use to study.

15:04.195 --> 15:06.563
- As soon as I find it.
- Purple. On it.

15:08.766 --> 15:11.101
While we're looking,
mind if I ask you a question?

15:11.135 --> 15:13.770
- What's up? - I was supposed
to go to Dobler's with Pete,

15:13.805 --> 15:16.940
but the lacrosse team decided to
stay in Chicago for Mardi Gras.

15:16.975 --> 15:18.475
I'm sad that we're not
gonna be together,

15:18.509 --> 15:20.577
but I don't want him
to think I'm some needy girl.

15:20.612 --> 15:25.649
I'm super bummed that we're not
gonna be together, but I get it, so...

15:25.683 --> 15:27.017
Casey, how do I feel?

15:27.051 --> 15:29.286
You've only been dating
for a short time,

15:29.320 --> 15:32.222
and up until now he's given you
no reason to doubt his character.

15:32.256 --> 15:33.857
How you react to this
will set a precedent.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.159
- OK.
- A measured response is best.

15:36.194 --> 15:39.329
Text, but don't call.
Be cool, but not cold.

15:39.364 --> 15:41.531
Tell him your preference
is that you wish he were here,

15:41.566 --> 15:43.266
but you understand
his situation

15:43.301 --> 15:45.202
and hope he has
a fun time with the team

15:45.236 --> 15:47.804
while also thinking about the great
time he could be having with you.

15:47.839 --> 15:49.806
If he doesn't find a way
to get back to Cyprus tonight,

15:49.841 --> 15:52.809
<i>- then res ipsa loquitur!
- Ooh.</i>

15:52.844 --> 15:55.178
<i>- Is that Harry Potter talk?
- It's lawyer talk</i>

15:55.213 --> 15:57.180
- for "the thing speaks for itself."
- Fancy.

15:57.215 --> 15:59.683
That was the most
perfect answer ever!

15:59.717 --> 16:01.518
I know! I am going
to ace this test

16:01.552 --> 16:04.121
and go on to kick some
Washingtonian ass!

16:04.155 --> 16:05.889
As soon as I find
my lucky hair tie.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.225
Yes!

16:12.096 --> 16:14.998
- Hey, you got a sec?
- Yeah.

16:15.033 --> 16:19.436
- Ramen noodles? - I used to
judge people for eating this stuff.

16:19.470 --> 16:22.339
But it's delicious
and in my price range.

16:22.373 --> 16:24.274
OK, what would you say
if I told you

16:24.308 --> 16:25.575
I knew of a way
for you to make

16:25.610 --> 16:27.444
a whole lot of money
for one night's work.

16:27.478 --> 16:29.579
I'd say you want
to harvest my organs.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.516
No. Gentleman's Choice needs
a little extra help tonight.

16:32.550 --> 16:34.384
Oh. You want to
harvest that organ.

16:34.419 --> 16:36.353
I understand if
you're not interested.

16:36.387 --> 16:39.990
No, it's that I told Rebecca
that we'd hang out tonight.

16:40.024 --> 16:42.859
I'd feel bad if I just bailed
on her, last minute like that.

16:42.894 --> 16:44.828
You could make enough
to buy back your laptop.

16:44.862 --> 16:48.532
- In one night? - Gays spend money on
Mardi Gras like grandmas at Christmas.

16:48.566 --> 16:51.935
All right,
yeah, I'm in.

16:51.969 --> 16:55.005
- All right. - Just do me a favor,
let's keep this between us.

16:55.039 --> 16:57.908
Rebecca does find it charming
that I don't have any money,

16:57.942 --> 17:01.111
but her opinion'd probably change if she
found out that I stole from the house.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.047
That'll be between you, me
and all the gay men of Cyprus.

17:04.082 --> 17:05.315
OK.

17:13.858 --> 17:14.958
Coming through!

17:16.694 --> 17:19.029
Hey! Got your message
about your hair thing.

17:19.063 --> 17:20.964
I told the guys to
pretend like you're not here

17:20.998 --> 17:23.800
so you can go about your business
in peace and get out of here sober.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.569
Thanks, Cap. I'm actually
feeling pretty good,

17:26.604 --> 17:28.472
even though it's one of
the biggest days of my life.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.607
It's kind of a big day
for both Cartwrights.

17:30.641 --> 17:33.844
- Why? What's Rusty doing?
- Nobody.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.113
Rusty?

17:37.815 --> 17:39.716
Did you tell her
about Katherine?

17:39.751 --> 17:42.519
- No. But you just did.
- What's going on with Katherine?

17:42.553 --> 17:45.255
- Nothing. - Did you do
something lame to piss her off?

17:45.289 --> 17:47.257
No. Even if I did,
it's none of your business.

17:47.291 --> 17:48.592
Russell Alan!

17:50.394 --> 17:52.662
Fine. If you must know,
Katherine and I

17:52.697 --> 17:55.132
are gonna have sex tonight.
Happy?

17:55.166 --> 17:58.235
No! I am not happy. And frankly,
I'm feeling a little sick.

17:58.269 --> 18:01.938
You two are allowed to date,
be cute, maybe hold hands,

18:01.973 --> 18:04.941
- but no sex.
- First of all, that's not up to you.

18:04.976 --> 18:08.378
Second, it wasn't even my idea.
She came to me.

18:08.412 --> 18:11.548
Apparently she's a virgin
and wants me to be the one who,

18:11.582 --> 18:15.185
- you know, changes that.
- That is not a good idea.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.254
If it goes badly, she's gonna
want to talk to me about it

18:17.288 --> 18:18.822
and then I'll have to
cut off my ears.

18:18.856 --> 18:20.590
It's not gonna
go badly because

18:20.625 --> 18:22.559
she doesn't have
anybody to compare me to,

18:22.593 --> 18:24.494
so there will be
no expectations.

18:24.529 --> 18:27.998
- I taught him that.
- No expectations? Are you two crazy?

18:28.032 --> 18:30.534
She's had 21 years to
build up her expectations.

18:30.568 --> 18:34.237
She's not some normal girl who only
learns about sex from teen vampire movies.

18:34.272 --> 18:36.540
We're talking about Katherine.
She reads.

18:36.574 --> 18:39.943
<i>You're competing with Robert
Pattinson and Lady Chatterley's Lover.</i>

18:39.977 --> 18:41.378
Oh, I read that book.

18:42.380 --> 18:44.915
All right, I saw
it on Skinemax.

18:44.949 --> 18:48.251
You know, I don't have time for this.
I'm about to step into my future.

18:48.286 --> 18:51.087
So, if I were you,
I'd seriously rethink this.

19:45.201 --> 19:49.004
This will commence the Logical
Reasoning portion of the test.

19:49.038 --> 19:53.475
You have 35 minutes,
starting now. Good luck.

19:55.511 --> 19:57.312
<i>It's OK to be nervous.</i>

19:59.081 --> 20:01.550
<i>"The government chose not to
require warnings on products</i>

20:01.584 --> 20:04.152
<i>containing caffeine because
if the findings were refuted,</i>

20:04.187 --> 20:06.054
<i>the government would
lose credibility.</i>

20:06.088 --> 20:08.557
<i>Which of the following
is suggested by the above?</i>

20:08.591 --> 20:11.993
<i>A) A warning that applies to a
small population is inappropriate?</i>

20:12.028 --> 20:14.596
<i>B) Few people drink more than
six cups of coffee a day?</i>

20:14.630 --> 20:17.098
<i>Or C) Cappie won't
declare a major?"</i>

20:21.537 --> 20:24.706
<i>Focus, Casey!</i>

20:27.577 --> 20:29.177
<i>Why hasn't Cappie
declared a major?</i>

20:29.212 --> 20:30.879
<i>I mean, I knew what
I was getting into,</i>

20:30.913 --> 20:32.881
<i>but is he ever
going to leave CRU?</i>

20:32.915 --> 20:34.182
<i>Why would he lie to me?
And, oh, my God,</i>

20:34.217 --> 20:35.984
<i>why is that guy tapping
his foot?</i>

20:55.271 --> 20:58.039
Hey! The next parade
theme is...

20:58.074 --> 21:01.076
...people with cups!

21:01.110 --> 21:04.512
Follow me! Whoo!

21:06.048 --> 21:07.682
You may not
be aware of this,

21:07.717 --> 21:10.819
but Mardi Gras originated in
Mobile, Alabama, not New Orleans.

21:10.853 --> 21:13.488
In 1830 by the Cowbellion
de Rankin Society.

21:13.522 --> 21:16.892
Nobody likes
a know-it-all, Dana.

21:18.561 --> 21:20.929
Looks like somebody's shirking
their sober sister duties.

21:22.899 --> 21:24.432
Excuse me for a minute.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.637
What's that?

21:28.671 --> 21:32.908
- Oh, um, it's silly.
- I just find I'm at my best

21:32.942 --> 21:35.310
when I have a schedule made
for the day's activities.

21:35.344 --> 21:38.647
- Is "have sex" on there?
- There's a window.

21:38.681 --> 21:44.252
You know, I read somewhere that a woman's
first time is never really the best.

21:44.287 --> 21:46.254
<i>In CosmoGirl? Yes.</i>

21:46.289 --> 21:48.056
I have been doing
this research, too.

21:48.090 --> 21:50.659
Albeit in magazines geared
toward a younger demographic.

21:50.693 --> 21:53.395
Apparently most people
my age are no longer virgins.

21:54.463 --> 21:55.897
I just wanted to make sure

21:55.932 --> 21:59.501
that we have the same
expectations about that.

21:59.535 --> 22:03.204
- In terms of positions?
- No, I mean...

22:03.239 --> 22:06.574
...who did you imagine when
you pictured your first time?

22:06.609 --> 22:11.813
Well, I always thought
Al Gore was very hunky.

22:12.415 --> 22:14.683
Al Gore? Really?

22:14.717 --> 22:17.385
I know he's not really
an option. He's married, and...

22:17.420 --> 22:19.554
...he has a very busy
speaking schedule.

22:23.025 --> 22:26.027
What?
So I like smart bad boys.

22:26.062 --> 22:27.996
Well, at least it
wasn't Robert Pattinson.

22:29.065 --> 22:30.298
Who?

22:35.471 --> 22:37.005
I can't believe
we're here.

22:37.039 --> 22:40.308
We'll just stay long enough to
congratulate Casey on her test.

22:40.343 --> 22:45.680
- Mardi Gras!
- Yes, thank you.

22:45.715 --> 22:48.083
I was supposed to be
at Dobler's with Pete.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.185
And I was supposed
to be with Evan.

22:50.219 --> 22:54.389
Aw, look at you,
all lovey-dovey.

22:54.423 --> 22:58.159
It's ridiculous that he has to work an
emergency medical conference on Mardi Gras.

22:58.194 --> 23:02.163
- What do you say, ladies?
- Go ask a Tri Pi!

23:03.632 --> 23:05.934
Whoa! Oh, oh!

23:05.968 --> 23:09.471
Rebecca, you look
really great tonight.

23:12.141 --> 23:14.876
- Was that too far?
- No. It was really nice of you.

23:14.910 --> 23:17.812
I was gonna suggest
we go up to my room,

23:17.847 --> 23:21.716
but I didn't because
that would be going too far.

23:21.751 --> 23:26.721
And you expecting me to have sex with
you as a reward for not going too far

23:26.756 --> 23:27.822
is going too far.

23:29.558 --> 23:33.528
- So we're not having sex?
- Bye, Beav.

23:33.562 --> 23:37.065
Yes, these lovely and elegant
beads can be yours...

23:37.099 --> 23:40.068
- We're outta here.
- We can congratulate Casey later.

23:40.102 --> 23:43.938
OK, well, we'll talk.
All right? Yes!

23:53.983 --> 23:55.784
I thought you said
I'd make a lot of money.

23:55.818 --> 23:59.521
Maybe the guys are getting
a straight vibe from you.

24:00.423 --> 24:01.556
What?

24:01.590 --> 24:04.259
I'm just admiring
how great you look.

24:04.293 --> 24:09.230
- You could just use one minor
adjustment here. - Really?

24:09.265 --> 24:12.367
Yeah. It's Mardi Gras.
Just go for it.

24:12.401 --> 24:15.537
All right.
Gay men of Cyprus, look out!

24:19.608 --> 24:21.276
I think I know
what my problem is.

24:23.979 --> 24:27.315
- Oh! What are you doing?
- I'm advertising.

24:29.151 --> 24:30.218
Can I have a beer?

24:30.252 --> 24:34.022
This is so much better.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.523
No one will
objectify us here.

24:35.558 --> 24:39.427
And look at all the cute,
shirtless gay boys!

24:39.462 --> 24:41.930
OK, dancing.

24:50.973 --> 24:53.908
Twice in one day?

24:53.943 --> 24:56.678
- What brings you down here?
- I wanted to see how you did.

24:56.712 --> 24:58.746
That's so nice, but you didn't
have to come all this way.

24:58.781 --> 25:01.649
I know I didn't have to.
I wanted to.

25:01.684 --> 25:04.552
- So?
- I did OK, I guess.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.888
It was hard to concentrate
for so long.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.990
Some life stuff
tried to seep into my head.

25:09.024 --> 25:11.960
But your advice definitely
helped. So, thank you.

25:11.994 --> 25:14.062
Good.
These should help, too.

25:14.096 --> 25:16.231
- Oh!
- It's what I wanted when I was done.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.600
Thought you might be
feeling the same way.

25:18.634 --> 25:21.302
The cookies are because you
probably haven't eaten in a week,

25:21.337 --> 25:23.972
and the Scotch is because
that's what lawyers drink.

25:24.006 --> 25:27.142
- Right.
- And, well, because it's Scotch.

25:27.176 --> 25:31.379
- So, you got plans?
- Oh, um...

25:31.413 --> 25:34.415
I'm supposed
to go to this party.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.486
You know what?

25:38.521 --> 25:40.121
The party's not
going anywhere.

25:40.156 --> 25:43.391
Good. I was hoping
you would say that.

25:49.098 --> 25:51.332
Hey, Spitter. It's like being
on Bourbon Street, isn't it?

25:54.870 --> 25:56.738
We may need more Bourbon.

25:56.772 --> 25:59.741
So, how's it going
with Katherine?

25:59.775 --> 26:01.776
Really good.
We're in the "free party time"

26:01.810 --> 26:03.077
of tonight's schedule.

26:03.112 --> 26:05.813
She's in the parade
for people from Wisconsin.

26:05.848 --> 26:07.148
Have you seen your sister?

26:07.183 --> 26:08.883
No, I thought she
was supposed to be here

26:08.918 --> 26:10.385
- after her test, though.
- So did I.

26:10.419 --> 26:12.053
I need to talk to her
about something.

26:12.087 --> 26:13.755
Don't worry,
I'm sure she'll show up.

26:13.789 --> 26:17.492
- It's Mardi Gras!
- Yeah, it's Mardi Gras.

26:17.526 --> 26:19.394
- I need to get another beer.
- Yeah!

26:23.032 --> 26:24.832
Hey, how's it going
with you guys?

26:24.867 --> 26:26.401
- Great.
- She's a delight.

26:28.771 --> 26:30.905
Go for Dale.

26:30.940 --> 26:32.473
No, you're
looking for Laura.

26:32.508 --> 26:34.375
She's the sober sister
tonight. I'm Dale.

26:34.410 --> 26:36.578
<i>- What's your name?
- Dale!</i>

26:36.612 --> 26:39.948
<i>- Laura gave me your number!
- What do you mean she gave you my number?</i>

26:39.982 --> 26:43.051
All right, who still hasn't seen 'em?

26:45.120 --> 26:47.822
- Not on my watch.
- Ready?

26:47.856 --> 26:49.457
All right, all right.
Show's over.

26:54.930 --> 26:58.233
- So how's it going with Dale?
- Dale? Dale's great.

26:58.267 --> 27:00.635
So what's up with
you and Katherine?

27:00.669 --> 27:03.538
- Things are going pretty well.
- How well?

27:03.572 --> 27:05.673
You're my
girl-pause-friend, right?

27:05.708 --> 27:07.742
- Definitely.
- OK.

27:07.776 --> 27:09.043
Then, I'll tell you.

27:09.078 --> 27:10.878
Katherine and I are
gonna have sex tonight.

27:10.913 --> 27:16.751
Wow, sex! Wow, I didn't know
you guys were that serious.

27:16.785 --> 27:19.153
We're not. This is
only our second date.

27:19.188 --> 27:23.224
- Oh, so you're that guy.
- What guy?

27:23.259 --> 27:27.028
No, she came to me.
This wasn't even my idea.

27:27.062 --> 27:28.997
She's the one who wants
to lose her virginity.

27:29.031 --> 27:31.633
And you're taking
her virginity no less. Wow.

27:31.667 --> 27:35.069
Is sex just some sort of
insignificant transaction to you?

27:35.104 --> 27:38.206
Wait a minute, she's not
making a big deal out of this.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.308
- Why should I?
- That just proves it right there.

27:40.342 --> 27:42.877
You not thinking that it's
a big deal makes you a dog.

27:42.911 --> 27:45.647
I am not a dog. She's the
one with the schedule!

27:45.681 --> 27:49.050
Oh, then hi-five
on that, bro! That's... great.

27:56.277 --> 27:59.879
- I didn't think I liked Scotch.
- What do you think now?

27:59.914 --> 28:03.116
I think I like Scotch.

28:06.253 --> 28:07.854
This is exactly
what I needed.

28:07.888 --> 28:09.722
I know. I remember.

28:09.757 --> 28:11.858
Walking out of that test,
I was mush.

28:11.892 --> 28:14.294
I didn't even have the brain
capacity to count to ten.

28:14.328 --> 28:16.329
- Now, you don't need to.
- Hmm.

28:18.199 --> 28:21.568
Wow. I can't believe
I was able to steer clear

28:21.602 --> 28:23.303
of all the
Mardi Gras madness.

28:23.337 --> 28:26.406
- It's Mardi Gras already?
- Oh, right.

28:26.440 --> 28:30.410
You're probably above all
the crazy partying stuff.

28:30.444 --> 28:32.278
Me? Are you kidding?

28:32.313 --> 28:35.048
Back in the day I would've
passed out, sobered up,

28:35.082 --> 28:37.484
- then passed out again by now.
- You?

28:37.518 --> 28:39.986
- Hmm-hmm. - Does Congressman
Paymer know about this?

28:40.020 --> 28:43.456
No. And she also doesn't
know that, as an undergrad,

28:43.491 --> 28:45.959
I streaked the Michigan/Ohio
State football game.

28:45.993 --> 28:49.262
- In November.
- No way!

28:49.296 --> 28:51.698
Stadium cops threw me
in the football jail.

28:51.732 --> 28:53.800
I swore that if I
ever got out of there,

28:53.834 --> 28:55.902
I was gonna earn a law degree

28:55.936 --> 28:57.937
and fight for streaker
rights everywhere.

28:57.972 --> 29:00.907
Well, it is important
to have dreams.

29:02.910 --> 29:05.311
So, no more wild days
like that?

29:05.346 --> 29:10.016
I guess at some point you realize
you've been there, done that.

29:10.050 --> 29:12.552
And you start to find
other things interesting.

29:23.898 --> 29:25.598
- King cake?
- No, thank you.

29:25.633 --> 29:28.434
I don't eat at
fraternity parties.

29:29.436 --> 29:31.037
But it's got
a baby in it!

29:34.108 --> 29:37.076
- Hey! - This is gonna be my
third trip to the ZBZ house

29:37.111 --> 29:39.679
- since Laura's gone wild.
- Let me ask you something.

29:39.713 --> 29:42.048
Do you resent Sheila
for taking your virginity?

29:42.082 --> 29:45.518
Uh, I don't think so.
I mean, I know it ended badly,

29:45.553 --> 29:48.154
but I think, on some level,
I wanted it to happen.

29:48.189 --> 29:51.791
- But you gave up God.
- True, but in the end I came back to him.

29:51.825 --> 29:56.362
Here come the weeble-wobbles.
Let's get you girls home.

29:56.397 --> 29:58.464
Hey. What are you
still doing here?

29:58.499 --> 29:59.933
Thought you were
on a sex schedule?

29:59.967 --> 30:02.535
Or, should I say,
a sexedule?

30:02.570 --> 30:04.437
I don't know what
I'm doing anymore.

30:04.471 --> 30:05.972
You're preparing to have sex.

30:06.006 --> 30:07.373
Do I need to walk you
through this again?

30:07.408 --> 30:10.176
Does taking Katherine's
virginity make me a dog?

30:10.211 --> 30:12.845
On the contrary.
It makes you a college student.

30:12.880 --> 30:14.414
A very lucky
college student.

30:14.448 --> 30:18.518
This evening, tonight,
is what college is all about.

30:18.552 --> 30:20.653
Look around you.
This is a magical place.

30:20.688 --> 30:22.655
It's not gonna get
any better than this.

30:24.291 --> 30:28.261
Look, all you have to
think about is whether or not

30:28.295 --> 30:30.597
it feels right to you.

30:30.631 --> 30:32.365
Don't let other people
get in your head about it.

30:32.399 --> 30:34.434
Just be your own
moral compass.

30:35.936 --> 30:37.737
- Beads! Beads!
- Wait a second.

30:37.771 --> 30:40.773
There's no way Anthony Hopkins
should have more beads than me!

30:52.253 --> 30:54.120
Oh, you don't
think I'll do it?

30:54.154 --> 30:58.258
I will do it!

31:05.199 --> 31:08.301
Whoa, too far! Too far.
But thank you.

31:13.874 --> 31:18.378
Oh, dude! You look just
like my friend... Ashleigh!

31:18.412 --> 31:19.946
You thought I was
a drag queen, didn't you?

31:19.980 --> 31:23.416
No. What are you doing here?

31:23.450 --> 31:28.221
We were at the KT house, but got
tired of getting ogled by frat guys.

31:28.255 --> 31:30.957
- Uh, nice.
- Yeah, I'm getting my gay on.

31:30.991 --> 31:33.259
- It's about time!
- Wait a minute, you said "we."

31:33.294 --> 31:36.329
- Who are you here with?
- Rebecca. She's over at the bar.

31:40.334 --> 31:42.602
Yo, dance with
Ashleigh for a second.

31:48.409 --> 31:51.878
Excuse me. I'm not just saying
this because it's Mardi Gras,

31:51.912 --> 31:55.114
but you are hot.

31:55.149 --> 31:58.951
- You know I'm a girl, right?
- And I'm straight.

32:00.954 --> 32:02.889
Hey, man! Look at this!

32:02.923 --> 32:04.924
All it took was a little
blatant nudity. Who knew?

32:04.958 --> 32:07.627
Yeah, well, you might want to
cover up because Rebecca's here.

32:11.065 --> 32:13.466
- I guess the jig is up.
- What are you gonna do?

32:15.436 --> 32:17.136
Have a little fun on Mardi Gras.

32:19.306 --> 32:20.807
What's your name?

32:22.609 --> 32:26.813
- Stranger in a bar.
- Oh, no complications, huh?

32:28.182 --> 32:32.285
Why not?
It is Mardi Gras.

32:32.319 --> 32:34.987
- What can I get you guys?
- Two cosmos.

32:43.430 --> 32:44.497
What are you doing?

32:56.877 --> 32:59.612
Oh, hey, thanks
for the party, dude.

32:59.646 --> 33:01.414
See you in the lab.

33:01.448 --> 33:05.084
Hey, I don't know what your
problem is, but I am not a dog.

33:05.119 --> 33:07.887
I've been navigating
by my own moral compass.

33:07.921 --> 33:10.890
- If you say so.
- I do.

33:10.924 --> 33:15.294
- Why do you even care, anyway?
- Because I like you. Duh.

33:15.329 --> 33:19.532
Again? But you told me at
the nerd auction you don't.

33:19.566 --> 33:21.434
I tried to ask you out
and you turned me down.

33:21.468 --> 33:23.736
You know, for a smart guy
you sure are dumb.

33:23.771 --> 33:26.606
I mean, look at all the signs
I've been giving you.

33:26.640 --> 33:29.409
Like insulting my character?
Calling me a dog?

33:29.443 --> 33:33.212
No, like getting dressed up,
putting make-up on.

33:33.247 --> 33:35.348
Do you know that I even
wore these stupid heels

33:35.382 --> 33:37.483
because I calculated
our height difference,

33:37.518 --> 33:41.120
and knew these would
facilite eye-to-eye contact.

33:41.155 --> 33:43.923
Your math was perfect.

33:45.292 --> 33:47.994
After all the time we've
spent together in the lab,

33:48.028 --> 33:49.796
how can you not see it?

33:49.830 --> 33:52.732
We have a great time,
we have so much in common.

33:52.766 --> 33:55.601
We just make sense.

33:58.138 --> 34:00.606
So you don't want to be
my girl-pause-friend?

34:01.875 --> 34:02.909
Never mind.

34:04.278 --> 34:07.113
- Dana!
- Rusty?

34:07.147 --> 34:09.047
It's time.

34:14.588 --> 34:17.023
I used to be able to
put away a whole bag of these.

34:17.056 --> 34:20.827
- Oh, right.
- No, seriously, I was a fat little kid.

34:20.860 --> 34:23.329
Well, you certainly
grew out of that stage.

34:25.899 --> 34:29.368
So the test. There were a lot
of really tough questions.

34:29.402 --> 34:32.103
Hmm, it's over now.
Next stop, law school.

34:32.139 --> 34:34.172
And you didn't even have
to streak a football game.

34:34.208 --> 34:37.376
I know. Oh! Oh!
I almost forgot.

34:37.411 --> 34:39.045
My lucky talisman.

34:39.079 --> 34:41.179
I was going to go with
Pussy-Willow the Seventh,

34:41.215 --> 34:44.283
but they won't even let you
bring a phone, so...

34:44.318 --> 34:46.152
I hope it worked.

34:55.062 --> 34:58.464
- I can't.
- Oh.

34:58.499 --> 35:04.370
- No, it's just...
- You've got a boyfriend, don't you?

35:07.508 --> 35:10.576
I'm sorry, Casey. I wouldn't
have done that if I'd known.

35:10.611 --> 35:13.179
No. No, it's my fault.
I should've been more up-front.

35:13.213 --> 35:16.516
It's OK.
I should get going.

35:18.619 --> 35:22.488
I do have one last logical
reasoning question for you.

35:22.523 --> 35:24.557
Why would a girl spend
an evening with a guy

35:24.591 --> 35:26.993
and not tell him
she has a boyfriend?

35:29.162 --> 35:31.163
Good thing
that wasn't on the test.

35:33.767 --> 35:35.001
Good night, Casey.

35:46.938 --> 35:51.542
- That was weird. - Not what I imagined
your medical conference to look like.

35:51.576 --> 35:54.945
No, I meant you kissing
a guy right in front of me.

35:54.979 --> 35:57.781
Come on. He was a
gay guy in a gay bar.

35:57.816 --> 36:00.184
- It's not a big deal.
- It's a big deal to me.

36:01.820 --> 36:05.389
- I want to be exclusive with you.
- Why?

36:05.423 --> 36:08.926
That's not exactly the
response I was expecting.

36:08.960 --> 36:12.296
Because I care about you,
that's why.

36:12.330 --> 36:14.164
I care about you, too.
But that doesn't mean

36:14.199 --> 36:16.633
- we need to be exclusive.
- Well, what does that mean?

36:19.904 --> 36:22.773
Wait a minute. You mean
you haven't been exclusive?

36:27.512 --> 36:30.948
When? With who?

36:30.982 --> 36:32.750
- Was it Cappie?
- No.

36:32.784 --> 36:34.852
- Well, then who was it?
- It doesn't matter.

36:34.886 --> 36:37.321
- Look, Evan, I'm sorry...
- I can't believe this!

36:37.355 --> 36:40.157
Do you have any idea
why I'm working here?

36:40.191 --> 36:44.561
To pay back money that I stole from
my own house to buy you that necklace.

36:46.030 --> 36:47.865
I never asked you
to do any of that.

36:47.899 --> 36:49.800
I've always been
honest with you.

36:49.834 --> 36:51.268
I'm not the kind of girl
who's gonna have

36:51.302 --> 36:52.736
an ordinary relationship.

36:52.771 --> 36:54.505
That's something
you've talked yourself into.

36:54.539 --> 36:56.373
Love doesn't work.

36:56.407 --> 36:58.976
And you trying to force this on
me is what's screwing this up!

36:59.010 --> 37:01.645
No, you screwing this up
is what's screwing this up!

37:01.679 --> 37:04.248
You can hide behind
that crap all you want to,

37:04.282 --> 37:07.684
but we both know that
it's just a lame excuse!

37:07.719 --> 37:10.487
You're afraid!

37:10.522 --> 37:13.457
This is why we should've
just been a one-night stand.

37:16.027 --> 37:18.695
Want to know why you
don't believe in love?

37:18.730 --> 37:20.497
Because you're heartless.

37:21.833 --> 37:25.969
Hey, what's going on?
Is everything OK?

37:27.238 --> 37:29.006
Yeah, take her home.

37:41.419 --> 37:43.153
Hello.

37:48.259 --> 37:51.595
<i>- Wow.
- I watched 9 1/2 weeks.</i>

37:51.629 --> 37:54.498
Apparently men find it erotic
when women wear dress shirts.

38:20.124 --> 38:22.492
I am prepared
to dance for you.

38:25.964 --> 38:28.799
You know what? Maybe we
should just get comfortable.

38:28.833 --> 38:31.335
OK. OK.

38:39.444 --> 38:41.812
I can't believe I'm
finally getting this over with.

38:44.249 --> 38:46.884
Oh.
OK, did it already happen?

38:46.918 --> 38:48.886
"Get this over with?"

38:48.920 --> 38:52.456
That sounds like
some sort of transaction.

38:52.490 --> 38:55.726
Well, I suppose,
in a way, it is.

38:55.760 --> 38:58.061
I'm not so sure
I want to be

38:58.096 --> 39:02.032
someone you just
get this over with...

39:02.066 --> 39:05.802
- ...with.
- Are we not doing this?

39:05.837 --> 39:09.406
I wish I was a bad boy.
I wish I was Al Gore.

39:09.440 --> 39:12.342
But I'm not. I'm sorry.

39:27.158 --> 39:29.793
Thank you, Dale.

39:31.496 --> 39:36.066
You are the best
sober sister ever!

39:36.100 --> 39:37.901
I know. Remember to
vote for my raise

39:37.936 --> 39:39.436
at the next
chapter meeting.

39:39.470 --> 39:44.441
- What are you doing?
- I want you to have something.

39:50.148 --> 39:54.584
- Show your butt. Nice.
- Those are my favorites.

39:55.753 --> 39:57.020
Let's go.

39:59.223 --> 40:03.126
Dale... and Laura?

40:24.682 --> 40:28.552
- Hey.
- Hey!

40:28.586 --> 40:30.687
You're just in time for
the final parade of the evening.

40:30.722 --> 40:34.891
Mardi Gras!
Parade, Pledge! Parade!

40:34.926 --> 40:37.894
Hey. Oh, get that
girl some beads!

40:37.929 --> 40:41.999
There were better ones.
So, how'd the test go?

40:42.033 --> 40:46.737
Um, OK. There was one logic
question that tripped me up.

40:46.771 --> 40:49.139
Oh, what was it?

40:50.608 --> 40:52.876
I saw the form.

40:52.910 --> 40:54.911
Why did you lie to me?
Why didn't you tell me that

40:54.946 --> 40:57.114
you're nowhere close
to picking a major?

40:57.148 --> 40:59.383
I just didn't want to distract
you before your test.

40:59.417 --> 41:01.251
Well, that didn't
really work out.

41:01.285 --> 41:04.721
OK, I'm sorry,
I screwed up.

41:04.756 --> 41:07.457
But the truth is, I didn't
fill it out because...

41:07.492 --> 41:10.460
...I'm not ready to graduate.

41:10.495 --> 41:13.330
I didn't tell you because you've
been putting so much pressure on me.

41:13.364 --> 41:16.533
I don't want to pressure you,
but this changes things.

41:16.567 --> 41:19.436
I thought we were past this,
and I could finally see

41:19.470 --> 41:22.606
some sort of future together,
but instead you lied to me?

41:22.640 --> 41:25.275
Even though we said we could
talk to each other about anything.

41:27.678 --> 41:29.413
I almost kissed
another guy tonight.

41:30.581 --> 41:32.249
What?

41:32.283 --> 41:36.686
Yeah, Joel came to see
how I did and he brought Scotch

41:36.721 --> 41:39.256
because that's what
lawyers drink, and...

41:39.290 --> 41:42.426
...but nothing happened. I just
don't know what your plan is,

41:42.460 --> 41:44.861
so I don't know what my plan is,
and it drives me crazy.

41:44.896 --> 41:48.532
I don't want a plan. I just know
I'm not ready to graduate.

41:48.566 --> 41:50.734
- Ever?
- Maybe.

41:59.110 --> 42:03.380
I'm gonna stay at the ZBZ house.

42:05.016 --> 42:06.383
Happy Mardi Gras.
