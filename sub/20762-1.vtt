00:56.133 --> 00:58.970
Good morning, Vermont.
It's the day before Christmas,

00:59.003 --> 01:01.272
and the big guy's right around
the corner. We're looking at

01:01.305 --> 01:04.241
some of your favorite Christmas hits
all day long, so keep it locked.

01:24.796 --> 01:26.363
Morning, pops.

01:26.397 --> 01:28.365
Hey.

01:28.399 --> 01:31.302
The doctor said that if you
get out and about more,

01:31.335 --> 01:32.904
you'd get your strength back.

01:32.937 --> 01:36.240
You probably wouldn't get sick as much.

01:36.273 --> 01:37.975
I know.

01:41.245 --> 01:44.348
Never mind. Hey, pops, we can
always try again tomorrow.

01:44.381 --> 01:46.684
Okay.

01:48.753 --> 01:53.224
Oh, my gosh, last night I had
a dream about this stallion.

01:53.257 --> 01:56.994
He was so gorgeous, dad,
you wouldn't believe it.

01:57.028 --> 01:58.763
Hmm. I don't know.

01:58.796 --> 02:02.066
- Sounds like a Kelpie to me.
- What's a Kelpie?

02:02.099 --> 02:03.901
Uh, you don't wanna know about Kelpies.

02:03.935 --> 02:06.704
Yes, I do. I just asked.

02:06.738 --> 02:10.341
- Oh, they're scary, and not for...
- Dad.

02:10.374 --> 02:13.144
All right, but I warned you.

02:17.248 --> 02:20.818
Kelpies were once dark,
shape-shifting spirits

02:20.852 --> 02:24.989
that would take the secret
shape of beautiful horses.

02:25.022 --> 02:27.492
They lived near the water,
and they were known

02:27.525 --> 02:31.963
to be able to take the form
of both human and horse.

02:31.996 --> 02:35.432
But the thing about Kelpies
was they had the ability

02:35.467 --> 02:40.237
to see straight through
into your heart of hearts.

02:40.271 --> 02:44.075
If they saw wickedness, they
would entice these strangers,

02:44.108 --> 02:47.979
especially wicked children,
to ride upon their backs,

02:48.012 --> 02:50.515
and then they would dive into the lakes,

02:50.548 --> 02:53.217
and their riders were
never heard from again.

02:55.152 --> 02:57.254
- Drowned?
- Nobody knows.

02:57.288 --> 02:59.957
- Eaten?
- Nobody knows.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.127
Okay, okay.

03:50.508 --> 03:51.976
Wow!
It stinks in here!

03:52.009 --> 03:54.311
How do you even stand it?

03:54.345 --> 03:58.282
White linens?
Seriously, this is not a Vegas parade.

03:58.315 --> 04:00.017
Mother.

04:00.051 --> 04:01.553
Honey, you know I hate it
when you call me that.

04:01.586 --> 04:03.387
It makes me sound so old.

04:05.022 --> 04:07.058
Now don't be too much trouble,
you hear me?

04:07.091 --> 04:09.360
You gotta make a good first impression.

04:11.496 --> 04:13.397
You got the new one ready?

04:13.430 --> 04:14.431
Yeah.

04:14.466 --> 04:16.500
He's nervous.

04:16.534 --> 04:18.035
Come on.

04:23.407 --> 04:24.476
Molly?

04:24.509 --> 04:26.310
Merry Christmas, honey.

04:28.112 --> 04:29.246
Up there, sweetheart.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.315
He's beautiful.

04:31.348 --> 04:33.818
I'm gonna ride him every day.

04:35.386 --> 04:38.155
You look wonderful.

04:41.659 --> 04:43.861
Honey, just...
Stay calm, okay?

04:43.895 --> 04:45.162
Push your hands forward.

04:45.196 --> 04:46.297
Keep your hands forward, sweetheart.

04:48.099 --> 04:51.002
- I wanna get off.
- Don't pull on the rein.

04:51.035 --> 04:52.303
The horse is just getting
used to the barn.

04:52.336 --> 04:54.105
Would you get off that horse now?

04:54.138 --> 04:55.907
- It'll be fine, I promise.
- No, I don't want him.

04:55.940 --> 04:58.175
- Just give him some time.
- I said I don't want him!

05:01.112 --> 05:04.882
Please, if you'll
just take the time, okay?

05:04.916 --> 05:06.383
He'll be fine, I promise. Just...

05:06.417 --> 05:08.085
This isn't what I paid for.

05:08.119 --> 05:09.153
This is not what we talked about.

05:09.186 --> 05:10.922
This is not the horse.

05:13.558 --> 05:17.261
Don't worry about what any
of those stuffed shirts think.

05:17.294 --> 05:19.030
You're special.

05:21.332 --> 05:23.568
My dad always says that being special

05:23.601 --> 05:25.436
doesn't usually mean
you're better than anyone else,

05:25.470 --> 05:28.372
it's just normally something
that's on the inside

05:28.405 --> 05:31.042
that no one can really see.

05:31.075 --> 05:34.078
So maybe we're both special, huh?

05:34.111 --> 05:36.614
You think you're special?

05:41.586 --> 05:45.356
- No.
- Good.

05:45.389 --> 05:48.092
Because I heard your dad's a cripple,

05:48.125 --> 05:51.128
so what would he know
about being special?

05:51.162 --> 05:54.165
You're just a stable girl.
Now get away from my horse.

06:10.515 --> 06:12.450
Well, that couldn't go any worse.

06:14.385 --> 06:18.656
I gotta get a new instructor in here.

06:18.690 --> 06:21.693
Evie, I'm gonna have to have you come
in tomorrow to feed and clean stalls.

06:21.726 --> 06:24.128
- It's Christmas, Mr. McCarron.
- I know.

06:24.161 --> 06:26.698
My dad's caretaker is off for the
day and he's going to need me.

06:26.731 --> 06:29.534
Evie, I'm taking a big risk
having you here.

06:29.567 --> 06:32.670
You're underage, you can't
give me the hours I want,

06:32.704 --> 06:35.206
but I like you,
and I know you need the money,

06:35.239 --> 06:39.210
but if you can't come in, I'm going
to have to get somebody full-time.

06:39.243 --> 06:42.614
No, I... I get it.
I will be here tomorrow.

06:45.082 --> 06:49.086
- Merry Christmas, Evie.
- Merry Christmas.

06:56.227 --> 06:59.697
That horse today...

06:59.731 --> 07:02.266
Why can some people just be, and do,

07:02.299 --> 07:04.001
and have whatever they want,

07:04.035 --> 07:07.271
but the rest of us just
have to sit back and watch?

07:09.674 --> 07:11.408
Pops, I'm home.

07:13.377 --> 07:15.112
You just have to get out there,

07:15.146 --> 07:17.615
go after it.

07:17.649 --> 07:19.350
You know, a rich life,

07:19.383 --> 07:22.620
it isn't about material wealth.

07:22.654 --> 07:25.356
It's from inside, from your spirit.

07:28.826 --> 07:30.495
It takes a very special person

07:30.528 --> 07:33.397
to be able to achieve
the proper balance.

07:36.801 --> 07:40.071
Is that a super obscure way of
saying you think it's better

07:40.104 --> 07:42.807
that I don't have a horse?

07:42.840 --> 07:44.709
'Cause I gotta tell you,
I'm having a little trouble

07:44.742 --> 07:47.211
following that logic, pop.

07:47.244 --> 07:51.449
No, what I'm saying is,
is that whatever you think

07:51.483 --> 07:56.353
is an advantage
isn't always what it seems.

07:56.387 --> 07:58.623
The most prosperous people
I've ever known

07:58.656 --> 08:00.558
don't have half your goodness.

08:03.227 --> 08:06.498
And you are special.

08:06.531 --> 08:09.033
I'd be lost without you.

08:14.672 --> 08:16.273
Let's get you to bed, pop.

08:34.357 --> 08:37.294
- Give him some time.
- I said I don't want him.

08:45.202 --> 08:47.539
Evie, would you mind showing
everybody how it's done?

08:58.382 --> 08:59.684
Oh, Evie, that's amazing.

08:59.717 --> 09:03.187
- Will you teach me?
- Sure.

10:45.322 --> 10:47.625
It's Christmas.
How about a treat?

10:47.659 --> 10:49.794
How about some warm bran mash?

10:53.931 --> 10:55.700
Really?

10:55.733 --> 10:57.602
Which one of you did this?

11:05.510 --> 11:09.847
Hello?

11:11.483 --> 11:13.284
Hello?

11:57.662 --> 11:59.430
Whoa! Whoa!

12:01.566 --> 12:03.000
Hey there, boy.

12:03.034 --> 12:05.637
Easy.

12:05.670 --> 12:08.439
Easy.

12:08.473 --> 12:10.441
What are you doing out here?

12:12.944 --> 12:15.480
You're a pretty boy.

12:15.513 --> 12:20.952
Where's your rider?

12:20.985 --> 12:22.587
No rider?

12:24.421 --> 12:25.957
Hello?

12:27.024 --> 12:29.861
Is anybody out there?

12:29.894 --> 12:31.996
Hello?

12:32.029 --> 12:33.865
I have your horse.

12:35.867 --> 12:38.736
And he looks kinda familiar to me.

12:41.473 --> 12:43.475
Come on, buddy.
Let's get you back to the barn

12:43.508 --> 12:45.510
before you freeze out here.

12:49.380 --> 12:50.548
Come on.

12:52.016 --> 12:54.619
Come on, buddy. Come on.

12:57.955 --> 12:59.891
I don't know what you want me to do.

13:03.761 --> 13:05.663
No. Absolutely not.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.666
No getting on strange horses.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.836
Fine, you win.
No warm barn for you.

13:21.746 --> 13:23.848
I can see you.
I can see you moving.

13:23.881 --> 13:25.817
I know you don't want me
to leave you out here.

13:35.660 --> 13:37.495
No, no, wait.

13:37.529 --> 13:39.531
No, no.
What are you doing?

13:44.469 --> 13:45.703
Great.

13:46.704 --> 13:47.905
Whoa.

13:49.674 --> 13:51.576
I'm telling you right now,
if you throw me,

13:51.609 --> 13:52.944
I'm going to be so mad at you.

13:52.977 --> 13:54.779
Do you hear me, mister?

13:54.812 --> 13:55.813
Okay?

13:55.847 --> 13:57.782
Whoa!

13:57.815 --> 13:59.584
Whoa! Whoa!

14:00.618 --> 14:02.487
Hey, slow down!

15:26.303 --> 15:29.206
What on earth?

15:34.011 --> 15:35.547
Where are we?

15:38.282 --> 15:42.253
I am going to be in so much trouble.

15:47.959 --> 15:50.562
Did global warming just,
like, happen or something?

15:52.764 --> 15:54.966
Did we time travel?

16:04.709 --> 16:06.310
What?

16:06.343 --> 16:09.581
Don't look at me like that.
I am not happy about this.

16:10.882 --> 16:13.518
This is crazy.

16:29.601 --> 16:31.736
Okay, there's no way this is Vermont.

16:44.982 --> 16:47.051
It was just really annoying, you know?

16:47.084 --> 16:48.753
I mean, she looked right at me

16:48.786 --> 16:51.623
and was just like,
"you think you're special?"

16:51.656 --> 16:56.761
And I just kinda froze
and I was like, "uh..."

16:56.794 --> 16:58.062
The whole thing caught me
off guard, you know?

16:59.964 --> 17:02.066
Are you sure this is the right way?

17:05.169 --> 17:07.271
Good, because my dad will freak out

17:07.304 --> 17:08.906
if I'm not home soon.

17:14.078 --> 17:15.913
Wait, what's that?

17:33.898 --> 17:35.232
What is that?

17:55.887 --> 17:57.689
Hello?

18:07.465 --> 18:09.734
Hello?

18:15.406 --> 18:17.909
Is that her?

18:17.942 --> 18:19.711
It must be.

18:19.744 --> 18:21.145
She's here.
She's here.

18:21.178 --> 18:22.714
Tell the others.

18:28.419 --> 18:29.887
She doesn't look like much.

18:34.759 --> 18:36.360
Places everyone!
Places!

18:53.778 --> 18:55.913
Hello, Evelyn Flynn.

18:57.515 --> 19:02.219
Who are you?
How do you know my name?

19:02.253 --> 19:04.856
I've been waiting for you

19:04.889 --> 19:07.792
for a very long time.

19:07.825 --> 19:10.962
Where am I?

19:10.995 --> 19:13.297
You're inside the cave of revelation.

19:13.330 --> 19:15.967
Everything is seen as it truly is.

19:17.835 --> 19:19.170
Stones from this cave

19:19.203 --> 19:22.039
were used to forge the Scepter of Truth.

19:24.341 --> 19:27.044
You are here for a reason, Evelyn Flynn.

19:29.413 --> 19:30.882
What's happening?

19:30.915 --> 19:33.384
The cave is showing you something.

19:35.920 --> 19:39.757
This is the World of Albion.

19:39.791 --> 19:43.461
Albion was home to the Danaan,

19:43.495 --> 19:46.864
a peaceful and selfless race.

19:46.898 --> 19:50.367
The Danaan possessed
four ancient treasures

19:50.401 --> 19:53.337
that maintained harmony
amongst their people.

19:53.370 --> 19:57.975
The scepter of truth,
no one can lie in its presence.

19:58.009 --> 19:59.511
The cauldron of plenty,

19:59.544 --> 20:02.379
to never know hunger.

20:02.413 --> 20:07.018
The flame of knowledge,
the answer to all questions.

20:08.019 --> 20:10.321
And the Book of Healing,

20:10.354 --> 20:12.423
to heal all wounds.

20:14.559 --> 20:19.897
One day, the Milesians arrived,

20:19.931 --> 20:23.568
carried on dark clouds
from the Northern Worlds,

20:23.601 --> 20:26.938
led by the evil and greedy
General Eeder.

20:31.442 --> 20:33.945
They came to take the four treasures

20:33.978 --> 20:36.881
and destroy the Danaan people.

20:42.186 --> 20:45.122
Desperate for peace,
the Queen of the Danaans

20:45.156 --> 20:48.325
sought out the Abbess, a magical being

20:48.359 --> 20:50.495
who lives separate from either race.

20:50.528 --> 20:53.164
She brokered a treaty bound by magic,

20:53.197 --> 20:56.400
and it was agreed that Albion
would be divided in half.

20:56.433 --> 21:00.271
But in a wicked piece of trickery,

21:00.304 --> 21:03.475
the Milesian General
chose the top half of Albion,

21:03.508 --> 21:06.978
subjugating the Danaan
to the world underground.

21:07.011 --> 21:10.181
But the General's obsession
with the day he would finally

21:10.214 --> 21:12.950
rid his world of the Danaan

21:12.984 --> 21:16.120
has grown with every passing year.

21:16.153 --> 21:20.925
Some believe that day
to finally be at hand.

21:25.997 --> 21:28.032
Ah, this oughta be good.

21:28.065 --> 21:29.366
Did she like it?

21:29.400 --> 21:31.202
She hasn't said anything.

21:31.235 --> 21:32.369
Huh.

21:34.105 --> 21:35.640
I'm in another world?

21:38.676 --> 21:41.345
"I'm in another world?"

21:41.378 --> 21:44.215
There are portals between our two worlds

21:44.248 --> 21:45.550
that are ever-changing.

21:45.583 --> 21:47.619
Evie.

21:47.652 --> 21:49.987
Dear Evie,

21:50.021 --> 21:52.890
the Danaan people need your help.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.929
Wake up.

21:59.130 --> 22:00.598
Wake up.

22:02.066 --> 22:05.002
Wake up.

22:05.036 --> 22:07.505
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

22:10.041 --> 22:12.477
I have absolutely no idea.

22:12.510 --> 22:15.346
Where did you come from?

22:15.379 --> 22:18.115
Vermont.

22:18.149 --> 22:20.417
What land is this Vermont?

22:23.655 --> 22:25.189
I don't really understand the question.

22:25.222 --> 22:27.224
Why did you steal my horse?

22:29.193 --> 22:30.495
I know you're not my horse,
I was just...

22:32.564 --> 22:35.633
Can you please allow me to continue
questioning the prisoner?

22:37.735 --> 22:39.704
Why did you steal my horse?

22:39.737 --> 22:42.039
Your horse?
No, I swear,

22:42.073 --> 22:43.340
I didn't know.

22:43.374 --> 22:45.242
You don't need to swear.

22:45.276 --> 22:46.944
You couldn't tell a lie
if you wanted to.

22:46.978 --> 22:49.046
The scepter won't allow it.

22:49.080 --> 22:50.982
You are not in charge of this quest.

22:51.015 --> 22:52.550
She could be a Milesian spy.

22:54.018 --> 22:55.520
What do you mean you brought her here?

22:55.553 --> 22:59.156
Are you insane?

22:59.190 --> 23:00.592
We're on a perilous mission

23:00.625 --> 23:02.594
that could include death and torture.

23:02.627 --> 23:03.353
Hey!

23:03.354 --> 23:05.530
The last thing we need is
a frightened little girl.

23:05.563 --> 23:07.665
- Hey!
- Would you please be quiet a moment?

23:07.699 --> 23:10.434
No, I won't!

23:10.468 --> 23:11.669
Who...

23:12.704 --> 23:14.305
Who...

23:14.338 --> 23:15.673
Who are you?

23:15.707 --> 23:18.009
Where are you from?
Who is this crazy horse?

23:18.042 --> 23:20.377
And why are you acting like
you're having a conversation?

23:20.411 --> 23:23.114
You're not a little girl, Evie.

23:23.147 --> 23:25.182
How does everyone know my name?

23:25.216 --> 23:26.984
- Dag Dia told me.
- Who's Dag Dia?

23:27.018 --> 23:29.220
The Kelpie.

23:29.253 --> 23:32.089
The horse.

23:34.358 --> 23:36.327
No, she is not going with us.

23:36.360 --> 23:37.629
I'm not going anywhere with you.

23:37.662 --> 23:39.497
Exactly. Kindly hand me back the Scepter

23:39.531 --> 23:42.233
and we'll be on our way.

23:42.266 --> 23:43.501
This is the Scepter of Truth?

23:43.535 --> 23:46.437
Really?

23:46.471 --> 23:48.773
A powerful priceless artifact,

23:48.806 --> 23:51.743
and you go around announcing
that we have it to the world!

23:51.776 --> 23:53.210
No, he didn't tell me.

23:53.244 --> 23:57.148
The cave of revelation did.

23:57.181 --> 23:58.783
The strange man.

24:02.687 --> 24:04.188
Really?

24:04.221 --> 24:06.190
I've heard legends of magic in there.

24:08.225 --> 24:11.062
Men who could turn into
horses or vice-versa.

24:11.095 --> 24:14.532
Something like that.
Kelpies, they called them.

24:14.566 --> 24:16.233
I never believed that, though.

24:16.267 --> 24:17.802
Just blarney from halfwits.

24:17.835 --> 24:19.804
Thank you.

24:19.837 --> 24:22.574
Look, please help me.
I need to go home.

24:22.607 --> 24:24.208
My father's not well.

24:24.241 --> 24:26.744
- It's Christmas!
- What's Christmas?

24:26.778 --> 24:28.212
Christmas.

24:28.245 --> 24:30.515
You know, Santa?

24:30.548 --> 24:32.416
Has these elves that help him
fly around the world

24:32.450 --> 24:34.285
in one night delivering
presents on a sleigh

24:34.318 --> 24:36.654
pulled by magical reindeer?

24:36.688 --> 24:38.790
Sorry, can't help you.

24:38.823 --> 24:41.759
I'm incredibly busy
trying to save my people

24:41.793 --> 24:43.661
from certain annihilation.

24:43.695 --> 24:47.398
And unfortunately, it's a bit
time sensitive, so...

24:47.431 --> 24:50.067
No! She's not coming with us.

24:50.101 --> 24:53.137
She's obviously mad.

25:00.177 --> 25:02.213
Would you like to join us on our quest

25:02.246 --> 25:04.281
that has absolutely
nothing to do with you

25:04.315 --> 25:06.618
and bears no consequence
on your future whatsoever,

25:06.651 --> 25:09.487
upon which you,
as a small helpless child,

25:09.521 --> 25:11.422
will almost certainly perish?

25:13.124 --> 25:14.826
- No.
- Well, I tried.

25:14.859 --> 25:17.462
- Let's go.
- Wait! How do I get home?

25:17.495 --> 25:20.164
Fine.

25:20.197 --> 25:23.267
Our first mission is to find
the Flame of Knowledge,

25:23.300 --> 25:28.573
which Dag Dia believes
will show you your path,

25:28.606 --> 25:31.676
if you would like to join us.

25:33.410 --> 25:36.113
- I would.
- Perfect.

25:36.147 --> 25:37.849
Just to the flame, then I go home.

25:37.882 --> 25:39.617
Ah.

25:42.854 --> 25:45.256
Hold this.

25:45.289 --> 25:46.791
We need to get going.

25:46.824 --> 25:49.461
The Milesians use
the weather to track us.

25:50.495 --> 25:52.129
Looks like rain.

26:16.921 --> 26:19.724
We're not gonna outrun the rain.

26:19.757 --> 26:21.158
Here.

26:21.192 --> 26:22.694
Put this on.

26:26.731 --> 26:29.233
It'll protect you.

26:59.897 --> 27:02.667
Eremon!

27:07.438 --> 27:08.840
Eremon!

27:24.689 --> 27:25.957
Again.

27:43.541 --> 27:46.277
Oh, that's better.

27:53.718 --> 27:55.219
What is this?

27:58.055 --> 28:00.525
What is this?

28:00.558 --> 28:03.360
Is someone trying to assassinate me?

28:03.394 --> 28:04.929
Show me your hands.

28:04.962 --> 28:06.798
All of you! Now!

28:06.831 --> 28:08.966
Show me your hands!

28:09.000 --> 28:10.935
Now! All of you!

28:21.546 --> 28:23.815
Treachery!

28:23.848 --> 28:25.617
Oh, terribly sorry, my lord.

28:25.650 --> 28:27.018
Treachery!

28:27.051 --> 28:28.786
It just is a flesh wound, sire.

28:28.820 --> 28:30.421
You see I was giving you
your daily mutton

28:30.455 --> 28:33.390
mutton! Mutton!
Oh, I love mutton.

28:33.424 --> 28:34.826
Well, of course you do.

28:34.859 --> 28:36.427
Where's that bloody thing?

28:36.461 --> 28:38.429
As I was feeding you,
I let my stupid hand

28:38.463 --> 28:39.997
linger too long, like a fool.

28:40.031 --> 28:42.299
- Wretched...
- And if you'd be so kind

28:42.333 --> 28:43.901
as to return my brainless little digit,

28:43.935 --> 28:45.937
I'll take a quick jaunt
down to the seamstress

28:45.970 --> 28:47.639
and see if she can't sew the half-witted

28:47.672 --> 28:50.575
little nubbin back on! Ah-ha!

28:52.710 --> 28:54.746
- Hang him.
- Oh, no!

28:54.779 --> 28:56.047
My lord, no!

28:56.080 --> 28:58.483
No, no, no! No! Um...

28:58.516 --> 29:00.785
Oh, thank you, my lord.
I knew you'd never...

29:00.818 --> 29:02.620
Skin him.

29:02.654 --> 29:04.922
Aah! Lord, no!

29:04.956 --> 29:08.826
No, wait! Wait! Wait!
I may want his skin on.

29:08.860 --> 29:12.930
Um, throw him in a dungeon
that's really horrible.

29:12.964 --> 29:15.467
I'll make my mind up later on.

29:31.649 --> 29:34.452
Eremon, what are you doing here?

29:41.626 --> 29:44.395
You sent for me, my lord.

29:45.963 --> 29:50.935
I... ahh...
I saw something

29:50.968 --> 29:52.904
flash through the rain
and then it was gone.

29:52.937 --> 29:57.374
It felt like...
It felt like, uh...

29:57.408 --> 30:00.778
Something I've not sensed
for a long time.

30:00.812 --> 30:01.913
A long time.

30:01.946 --> 30:04.782
I can't put my finger on it.

30:10.722 --> 30:14.692
But there was a strange magic...

30:17.028 --> 30:19.631
In the form of a girl.

30:19.664 --> 30:23.100
Now, Eremon, I want you
to seek out this child,

30:23.134 --> 30:25.670
find her, and destroy her.

30:28.740 --> 30:32.677
I don't chase little girls.

30:32.710 --> 30:36.113
Besides, what possible
threat could she hold?

30:38.616 --> 30:40.818
Do you insult me, Eremon?

30:40.852 --> 30:43.688
Nay, my lord.

30:43.721 --> 30:47.725
I am too close for any complications.

30:47.759 --> 30:49.561
Fail me now,

30:49.594 --> 30:54.566
and I shall drink the marrow
from within thy bones.

30:59.904 --> 31:03.107
You shall have
her little heart, my lord.

31:03.140 --> 31:04.676
Thank you.

31:04.709 --> 31:09.113
So, off to the Wicklen Mountain, hmm?

31:09.146 --> 31:11.015
My lord.

31:34.271 --> 31:36.207
Who are those people?

31:36.240 --> 31:38.943
Those are the Kukeri.
Don't worry about them.

31:38.976 --> 31:40.845
They must have a camp nearby.

31:40.878 --> 31:43.180
Okay, now I seriously need food.

31:43.214 --> 31:44.682
We don't have time.

31:44.716 --> 31:46.718
If I'm not back five days from now...

31:46.751 --> 31:48.853
What, you'll be grounded?

31:48.886 --> 31:51.556
Well, yes, I'll become the ground.

31:51.589 --> 31:53.725
What?

31:53.758 --> 31:56.227
The treaty allows five Danaan
a five-day window

31:56.260 --> 31:58.596
each harvest moon
to forage for provisions

31:58.630 --> 32:00.765
so we don't starve.

32:00.798 --> 32:02.534
Once the moon completes the cycle,

32:02.567 --> 32:04.536
if you're a Danaan
and you're above ground,

32:04.569 --> 32:07.038
you become the Earth.

32:07.071 --> 32:08.640
Well, on the bright side,

32:08.673 --> 32:10.875
at least I'll starve to death by then.

32:12.610 --> 32:14.946
You're an odd little girl, Evie.

32:21.152 --> 32:22.954
Can I ask you something?

32:22.987 --> 32:24.556
If I said no, would it stop you?

32:24.589 --> 32:26.991
Good point.

32:27.024 --> 32:28.626
I don't mean any offense by this,

32:28.660 --> 32:31.663
but why wouldn't the Danaan
have sent, like,

32:31.696 --> 32:33.765
an army or something to get provisions?

32:33.798 --> 32:37.569
It's in the fine print.
No army nor leader may cross the barrier

32:37.602 --> 32:39.704
as long as the treaty stands.

32:39.737 --> 32:42.306
Warriors have tried and failed.

32:42.339 --> 32:44.141
So now it's just you?

32:44.175 --> 32:45.610
It's not just me.

32:45.643 --> 32:47.144
They chose me for this mission.

32:47.178 --> 32:50.181
I was the strongest, the most resilient,

32:50.214 --> 32:52.617
the most skillful of all the Danaan.

32:55.653 --> 32:59.156
Wow, that's amazing.

32:59.190 --> 33:00.925
It is.

33:02.193 --> 33:04.629
How do you know where we're going?

33:04.662 --> 33:06.097
Dag Dia knows the way to the Abbess,

33:06.130 --> 33:10.034
and the torch will show us
the rest from there.

33:10.067 --> 33:12.169
The Abbess.
Is she good?

33:12.203 --> 33:14.706
I don't know.
Never met her.

33:14.739 --> 33:16.173
But she was a great friend to the Danaan

33:16.207 --> 33:20.111
in the early years after the fall.

33:20.144 --> 33:21.813
Some believe she's dead.

33:24.015 --> 33:25.850
Dag Dia doesn't, though.

33:27.785 --> 33:30.555
Can others understand him, too?

33:37.695 --> 33:39.597
It's following us.

33:39.631 --> 33:41.666
I know, I know!
We're going!

33:45.837 --> 33:48.940
No, not the hair!
Not the hair!

33:52.009 --> 33:53.344
What are you doing here?

33:53.377 --> 33:55.212
I'm rescuing you.
What does it look like?

33:55.246 --> 33:58.249
I don't need rescuing.
Go home, Lir.

33:58.282 --> 34:00.918
You two know each other?

34:00.952 --> 34:03.354
Uh...

34:03.387 --> 34:07.091
Lir's family are the protectors
of the Scepter of Truth.

34:07.124 --> 34:10.261
Such close proximity for so long
has made Lir unable to lie,

34:10.293 --> 34:12.664
which mixed with a staggering vanity,

34:12.697 --> 34:13.831
makes for a rough conversation.

34:13.864 --> 34:15.933
I'm not vain.

34:15.967 --> 34:18.101
I'm simply aware that I'm usually
the most striking individual

34:18.135 --> 34:19.270
in any sort of company,

34:19.303 --> 34:21.806
and the present is not excluded.

34:21.839 --> 34:23.675
Holy wow.
Is he for real?

34:23.708 --> 34:25.743
Yeah, of course I'm real.
What do you expect me to be?

34:25.777 --> 34:27.344
Some sort of ghost?

34:27.378 --> 34:29.013
Is she a halfwit?

34:29.045 --> 34:30.848
I really don't like him.

34:30.882 --> 34:32.016
Go home, Lir.

34:33.717 --> 34:35.418
You can't just steal the Scepter

34:35.453 --> 34:37.922
and go gallivanting
around Albion with it.

34:37.955 --> 34:39.757
The elders are furious.

34:39.791 --> 34:41.826
The elders won't listen.

34:41.859 --> 34:44.295
What are we supposed to do,
sit around doing nothing?

34:44.328 --> 34:46.831
Something's going on, Lir, I know it.

34:46.864 --> 34:48.199
Where are the Foragers?

34:48.232 --> 34:49.734
Some simply got lost.

34:49.766 --> 34:52.335
Foragers don't get lost.

34:52.369 --> 34:54.706
What are you saying?

34:54.739 --> 34:55.973
I don't know.

34:56.007 --> 34:57.408
We're going to find the Abbess.

34:57.441 --> 35:02.213
The Abbess?
You two seek out the Sorceress?

35:02.246 --> 35:05.082
- Are you scared?
- No.

35:05.116 --> 35:07.919
Wait, yes.

35:07.952 --> 35:10.154
Why the change?

35:10.187 --> 35:12.289
I suddenly realized
I can't let you go alone.

35:12.323 --> 35:13.424
- No.
- Yes.

35:13.458 --> 35:15.226
- No!
- Yes, I'm afraid so.

35:15.259 --> 35:17.795
No, I can see you're upset,
but I'm coming with you.

35:17.829 --> 35:20.331
I'd like you both to think
about how awful I feel

35:20.364 --> 35:24.301
about being so inappropriately
dressed for such a quest.

35:24.335 --> 35:26.471
Stay out of my way.

35:26.504 --> 35:27.939
Don't you say anything.

35:31.108 --> 35:33.945
How's the view back there,
my brave knight?

35:33.978 --> 35:37.081
Truthfully?
This has always been your best angle.

35:37.114 --> 35:39.083
You totally like him.

35:39.116 --> 35:41.018
You don't know what
you're talking about.

35:41.052 --> 35:43.821
It's obvious.
He's really cute,

35:43.855 --> 35:46.924
though I'm starting to think
honesty is seriously overrated.

35:46.958 --> 35:48.793
You're out of your depth here, Evie.

35:48.826 --> 35:50.361
I no more fancy him than a baby bird

35:50.394 --> 35:53.064
fancies a disease-ridden
tick on its neck.

35:53.097 --> 35:54.766
Did you just call yourself a baby bird?

35:54.799 --> 35:56.400
Enough on the subject!

35:56.433 --> 35:57.835
That's why you're mean to him.

35:57.869 --> 35:59.170
You're trying to flirt.

35:59.203 --> 36:00.805
You're completely...

36:09.313 --> 36:11.182
Tyris!

36:12.784 --> 36:14.719
The foragers.

36:17.555 --> 36:20.257
They're turning!
It's only been three days

36:20.291 --> 36:21.893
and they're turning!

36:24.529 --> 36:26.531
Now do you believe me?

36:26.564 --> 36:28.900
Does this look like they just got lost?

36:28.933 --> 36:30.935
What could have done this?

36:30.968 --> 36:33.771
They're killing our foragers
to starve us out.

36:41.979 --> 36:45.349
The Milesians will answer for this.

36:45.382 --> 36:48.453
We have to leave.
We cannot be exposed at night.

36:57.094 --> 37:00.932
Two fled on horseback.

37:00.965 --> 37:02.133
West.

37:04.135 --> 37:06.070
Both female.

37:08.205 --> 37:10.074
Shallow hoof-prints.

37:14.311 --> 37:16.814
That is no place for our kind.

37:16.848 --> 37:18.783
Milesians?

37:20.585 --> 37:23.888
Men whose deeds should
remain in the shadow.

37:27.191 --> 37:28.460
Move!

37:35.867 --> 37:38.102
Another cave?

37:40.872 --> 37:44.308
Dag Dia says the passage to
the lair of the Abbess lies within,

37:44.341 --> 37:47.044
just beneath the eyes of judgment.

37:47.078 --> 37:49.280
The eyes of judgment?

37:49.313 --> 37:51.015
Seriously?

37:51.048 --> 37:53.084
I think we'll camp inside
the mouth of the cave,

37:53.117 --> 37:55.453
move forward in the morning.

37:55.487 --> 37:56.921
Oh, thank the gods.

37:56.954 --> 37:58.422
Scared?

37:58.456 --> 38:01.092
What if a bat flew into my hair, huh?

38:01.125 --> 38:03.861
Think about that for the moment.

38:03.895 --> 38:05.963
So you used to be in charge
of protecting the Scepter?

38:05.997 --> 38:08.933
I was. I am.

38:08.966 --> 38:14.171
I protected it from scratches,
from water marks, sun damage.

38:14.205 --> 38:16.240
Sun damage?
You live underground.

38:18.109 --> 38:19.877
There was a spider once.

38:34.225 --> 38:37.629
If you knew all that I was capable of.

38:55.146 --> 38:57.148
What are you doing?

38:59.316 --> 39:01.285
Guys.

39:18.169 --> 39:19.937
Evie!

39:22.574 --> 39:24.942
Any eyes, painted or carved.

39:24.976 --> 39:28.646
Not the slightest sign
of any sort of doorway

39:28.680 --> 39:31.215
or anything man-made.

39:31.248 --> 39:32.650
I'm going to tear out my hair.

39:32.684 --> 39:35.386
Please don't.
You would look hideous bald.

39:35.419 --> 39:38.690
You have a very strange shaped head.

39:38.723 --> 39:40.391
She's correct.

39:40.424 --> 39:43.628
If this indeed was the hiding
place of the Abbess,

39:43.661 --> 39:45.429
seems like she's moved on.

39:45.463 --> 39:47.565
She's left us behind.

39:49.467 --> 39:53.037
I'm telling you, there were
no eyes painted or carved,

39:53.070 --> 39:55.272
judging or otherwise.

39:55.306 --> 39:58.275
Um, guys...

40:17.094 --> 40:21.032
I am Eriu of the Danaan.

40:21.065 --> 40:23.434
I wish to pass through the portal.

40:27.238 --> 40:28.640
Move back.
It won't work with you here.

40:28.673 --> 40:32.109
There's no way
those were the magic words.

40:32.143 --> 40:34.178
Maybe it needs to be
a riddle or something.

40:34.211 --> 40:37.181
Abracadabra.

40:39.250 --> 40:41.686
Alakazam!

40:41.719 --> 40:43.555
Open sesame?

40:43.588 --> 40:45.690
What? Those are really
powerful words in my world.

40:45.723 --> 40:48.025
Mm-hmm.

40:48.059 --> 40:53.130
As I was saying, only Danaan
can pass through the portal.

40:53.164 --> 40:54.732
Any ideas?

40:54.766 --> 40:56.801
He's never been inside.

40:56.834 --> 41:01.739
He doesn't know the ritual
or the ceremony it takes.

41:01.773 --> 41:03.775
Ceremony?

41:03.808 --> 41:06.143
Give me the Scepter.

41:06.177 --> 41:08.212
Give me your hand.
Come on.

41:09.514 --> 41:10.515
Ow!

41:10.548 --> 41:12.450
Oh, you...
Oh, look.

41:20.792 --> 41:23.628
Maybe it needs to be a love scene.

41:23.661 --> 41:25.262
Maybe the wall needs proven Danaan love.

41:25.296 --> 41:26.664
Come on here.

41:26.698 --> 41:28.432
Maybe that's what the dream was saying.

41:28.466 --> 41:29.634
What dream?
What are you talking about?

41:29.667 --> 41:31.368
Come on, Lir.
Come on! Wake up!

41:31.402 --> 41:33.571
I'm fine. It's just that...

41:37.842 --> 41:40.177
- Now take his other hand in yours.
- No.

41:40.211 --> 41:42.113
- Take his other hand in yours.
- No.

41:42.146 --> 41:44.582
Look, whatever notion you have
of me and this featherbrain...

41:44.616 --> 41:46.818
Scared of the truth?

41:46.851 --> 41:48.520
I'm not afraid of anything.

41:57.795 --> 42:00.698
Ooh, wow!
True love.

42:00.732 --> 42:02.767
I'll cut out your tongue.

42:05.402 --> 42:06.704
Walk.

42:06.738 --> 42:08.305
Thank you, Evie.

42:08.339 --> 42:09.707
Couldn't have done this
without you, Evie.

42:09.741 --> 42:10.775
You're so clever.

42:10.808 --> 42:12.677
I can hear you.

42:15.613 --> 42:18.215
We have to have
weapons ready when they come.

42:19.517 --> 42:21.653
No wedding, no king!

42:23.420 --> 42:24.789
There's not going to be a wedding,

42:24.822 --> 42:26.724
because we're going to destroy
every last one of them.

42:28.526 --> 42:31.328
We have to have weapons
ready when they come.

42:31.362 --> 42:32.897
Do we just knock?

42:32.930 --> 42:34.566
I wouldn't.
