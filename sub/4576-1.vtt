[Mice squeaking]

01:06.412 --> 01:07.504
Come on, sweetie pie.

01:08.648 --> 01:13.142
Morning, Elvis.
You're a pretty Elvis, aren't you?

01:13.219 --> 01:15.517
Yes, you are.

01:15.588 --> 01:18.182
Yes, you are.

01:18.257 --> 01:21.715
Jesus Christ, Ronnie, you know
I have to fucking work tonight.

01:22.428 --> 01:23.452
Somebody around here
has got to make some money.

01:24.063 --> 01:26.657
I'm all broken up here, bitch.
I can't work.

01:27.199 --> 01:29.099
- Yeah, and whose fault is that?
- Fuck you.

01:29.168 --> 01:31.432
Oh, my God, you're pathetic.

01:31.504 --> 01:33.699
You know that new waitress
over at the Bingo Lounge?

01:33.773 --> 01:36.003
She's been giving me the freaky eye.

01:36.075 --> 01:38.475
Oh, the whore with the big tits
hanging down to her knees?

01:38.544 --> 01:39.738
Maybe I'll choke the chicken,

01:39.812 --> 01:42.303
purge my snorkel
all over them flappy-ass tits.

01:42.381 --> 01:43.643
Good. Well, have
a good fucking time.

01:43.716 --> 01:44.978
- I will.
- I hope she likes cripples.

01:45.051 --> 01:49.181
Bitch, I will crawl over there,
and I will skull fuck the shit outta you!

01:49.255 --> 01:51.348
Oh, I'll get the crutches for you.

01:53.926 --> 01:55.894
See what you did?
Fucking loudmouth.

01:55.961 --> 01:56.950
Waah! Waah!

01:57.029 --> 01:58.724
That's all that fucker does is cry.

01:58.798 --> 02:00.698
Waah! Waah!

02:01.534 --> 02:03.229
Cry and shit. Cry and shit.

02:03.302 --> 02:05.202
Just like you.
That's all you do is cry and shit.

02:05.271 --> 02:07.501
Fuck you and set it
on my pole right now, bitch.

02:07.573 --> 02:09.199
Fuck off.

02:14.947 --> 02:17.040
Mom?

02:20.152 --> 02:22.177
Can't you see I'm making eggs over here?

02:22.254 --> 02:23.721
I'll pass.

02:23.789 --> 02:24.847
Since when?

02:24.924 --> 02:28.257
Since now. They're chicken abortions,
and they're fucking gross.

02:28.327 --> 02:30.158
They are not chicken abortions.

02:30.229 --> 02:31.924
Like you know what an abortion is.

02:33.866 --> 02:35.561
You know what, can you please
go upstairs and get your brother?

02:35.901 --> 02:37.562
Why do I always have to do it?

02:37.636 --> 02:38.830
Just do it!

02:40.840 --> 02:44.332
Don't you give me that look!

02:44.410 --> 02:47.345
Man, that bitch got herself
a nice little dumper.

02:48.547 --> 02:51.243
- What did you just say?
- You heard me.

02:51.317 --> 02:54.480
No, say it again, Ronnie!
Say it to my face!

02:54.553 --> 02:58.080
Oh, what's the matter?
You jealous of your own daughter's ass?

02:58.157 --> 03:00.318
- Fucking pig.
- Aah!

03:00.393 --> 03:01.985
You fucking whore!

03:02.094 --> 03:03.118
[Baby crying]

03:03.195 --> 03:05.720
All right, now clean it up!

03:05.798 --> 03:07.322
- Go on.
- I'm not gonna do this anymore!

03:08.968 --> 03:10.663
Michael.

03:10.736 --> 03:12.966
Stop jerking off in there.

03:13.038 --> 03:14.335
Get away!

03:14.407 --> 03:16.500
Hey! Get your ass downstairs

03:16.575 --> 03:18.440
and wash your hands, you little shit.

03:18.511 --> 03:22.038
I'm not listening!
Aaaahhh!

03:22.114 --> 03:23.342
Let me tell you something.

03:23.416 --> 03:25.577
That freak of yours,
he needs some serious discipline.

03:25.651 --> 03:27.642
I mean, he runs around like a little bitch.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.620
You leave him alone.
Keep your hands off him.

03:29.688 --> 03:32.919
Give me a fucking break.
He's probably a queer.

03:32.992 --> 03:35.290
He's gonna grow up,
end up cutting his dick and balls off

03:35.361 --> 03:37.192
and changing his name to Michelle.

03:38.431 --> 03:41.127
<i>There he is.
Good morning, Michelle, ma belle.</i>

03:41.200 --> 03:43.168
What the hell took you two so long?

03:43.235 --> 03:46.136
Elvis died. I had to flush him.

03:46.205 --> 03:48.673
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

03:48.741 --> 03:50.902
We'll get you a new one
after school, okay?

03:50.976 --> 03:52.238
Okay.

03:52.311 --> 03:55.246
What'd you do to him,
stroke him to death?

03:55.314 --> 03:56.804
Uh, Elvis.

03:56.882 --> 03:59.578
Elvis! Uh! Uh! Uh!

03:59.652 --> 04:01.517
You know what?
It's a fucking rat.

04:01.587 --> 04:03.384
Who pays money for a fucking rat?

04:03.456 --> 04:05.253
I mean, it's a goddamn rat, man.

04:05.324 --> 04:06.655
Morning, Boo.

04:06.725 --> 04:09.193
"Morning, Boo."

04:12.932 --> 04:14.229
Take that damn thing off.

04:18.637 --> 04:20.103
You are starting to annoy me, boy.

04:20.172 --> 04:21.196
I hate you.

04:21.273 --> 04:23.264
And I hate you, too. You see this?

04:23.342 --> 04:26.209
As soon as this heals,
I'm gonna break it again on your fucking face!

04:26.278 --> 04:28.746
[Mom] Enough, all right?
Can we just eat in peace for once?

[Urinating]

04:39.191 --> 04:42.490
What a fucking pussy, dude.
I told you he wouldn't fight.

04:42.561 --> 04:44.552
He's all fucking talk.
I was like-- We were fighting, right?

04:44.630 --> 04:47.292
You were there. He was like,
"I'm not gonna fight you." I was like--

04:47.366 --> 04:48.560
Yes!

04:50.069 --> 04:51.400
I know where he lives.

04:51.470 --> 04:53.700
- You want to egg his house?
- We can totally do that.

04:53.772 --> 04:54.898
- Yeah.
- Oh.

04:54.974 --> 04:56.874
Hey, shit-pants.

04:56.942 --> 04:59.433
What's going on? You know, um...

04:59.512 --> 05:03.073
I heard your sister got caught
selling blow jobs in the bathroom.

05:03.148 --> 05:08.142
I heard they had to pump the cum
out of her stomach.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.949
[Sucking sound]

05:10.022 --> 05:11.785
Hey, Mikey, how's your mom doing?

05:11.857 --> 05:15.020
You know, my old man said that for a buck
she'd rub her tits on his face.

05:15.094 --> 05:16.686
Shut up.

05:16.762 --> 05:18.093
What the fuck did you say, faggot?

05:18.163 --> 05:20.927
- Mikey's upset.
- Look how tough he is.

05:21.000 --> 05:24.766
Hey, ball-licker, check this out.

05:24.837 --> 05:28.830
I was thinking of making copies of Mommy
for the whole school.

05:28.908 --> 05:31.536
- Fuck you.
- Hey! Tough guy!

05:31.610 --> 05:36.070
Think she'd suck my dick for a quarter
and let me suck her tits?

05:36.148 --> 05:39.914
- Shut up! Shut up!
- Don't fucking yell in my face, you bitch!

05:42.121 --> 05:44.316
Fuck off!

05:44.390 --> 05:46.415

05:46.492 --> 05:47.481

05:47.560 --> 05:48.959
I said break it up!

05:49.028 --> 05:51.553
You over there,
you over there, you there.

05:51.630 --> 05:53.962
- He started it.
- Shut up!

05:54.033 --> 05:55.091
Fuck you.

05:57.670 --> 05:58.728
What did you say, son?

05:58.804 --> 06:01.466
I said fuck you.

06:01.974 --> 06:03.669
Fuck me?

06:04.577 --> 06:07.068
Come here.
Come here.

06:07.146 --> 06:08.511
- My bag!
- Grab it!

06:09.515 --> 06:13.747
Again? Again? Jesus, what is it with you
and this goddamn school?

06:13.819 --> 06:15.514
I cannot keep coming down here like this.

06:15.588 --> 06:17.613
Look, Miss Myers,

06:17.690 --> 06:21.956
I do not enjoy calling you down here
every five minutes.

06:22.027 --> 06:24.325
Really?
It sure seems like you fucking do.

06:24.396 --> 06:26.489
Can't you get control
over your school, principal?

06:26.565 --> 06:29.830
Yes, I can get control.
I can control my school.

06:29.902 --> 06:32.700
There's something you gotta know.

06:37.910 --> 06:41.437
Will you just relax a moment?
Please sit down and let me talk to you.

06:41.513 --> 06:43.708
- Please. Please.
- Okay. What?

06:43.782 --> 06:45.841
Please, sit down.

06:45.918 --> 06:48.751
- Thank God.
- Hi, Jim. How are you?

06:48.821 --> 06:49.845
Is this her?

06:51.490 --> 06:54.687
Miss Myers, this is Dr. Loomis.
I took the liberty of calling him in.

06:55.060 --> 06:57.221
- Happens to be a child psychologist--
- Thank you, Jim.

06:57.296 --> 06:58.593
Psychologist?

06:58.664 --> 06:59.995
May I ask you,

07:00.065 --> 07:03.398
has your son ever had any kind
of serious psychiatric evaluation?

07:03.469 --> 07:05.937
Okay, I've had enough.
This is crazy.

07:06.005 --> 07:07.666
- Miss Myers, please.
- I gotta get back to work.

07:07.740 --> 07:09.207
- I gotta go.
- Please, ma'am.

07:09.274 --> 07:12.038
We only want the best for the child.
Please don't take offense.

07:12.111 --> 07:13.703
Please, sit down. Sit down.

07:13.779 --> 07:14.803
Thank you.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.542
Look, uh, Miss Myers...

07:17.616 --> 07:19.277
we found this...

07:19.351 --> 07:21.148
in Michael's school bag.

07:23.122 --> 07:25.556
Come on. Big deal.
He found a dead cat.

07:27.626 --> 07:28.957
And these.

07:29.995 --> 07:31.519
What is that?

07:31.597 --> 07:33.758
I hope you're not squeamish, Mrs. Myers.

07:34.867 --> 07:37.131
Oh, God.

07:37.202 --> 07:39.170
Oh, this is really sick.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.099
Are you saying Michael did this?

07:44.643 --> 07:46.201
Michael loves animals. He--

07:48.981 --> 07:50.414
Why would he do this?

07:50.482 --> 07:55.977
Mrs. Myers, typically the thrill of hurting
or causing pain to smaller creatures,

07:56.055 --> 07:58.489
it's often an early warning sign.

07:58.557 --> 08:00.115
Early warning sign for what?

08:02.761 --> 08:04.956
For much deeper and bigger problems.

08:05.030 --> 08:07.362
[Mrs. Myers] What do you mean problems?
What is this?

08:07.433 --> 08:10.095
[Loomis]
He's a very disturbed young man.

08:10.169 --> 08:14.003
I have to evaluate him,
and I'd like to interview him.

08:14.073 --> 08:16.974
I need to take him
through a series of tests.

08:17.042 --> 08:18.669
[Mrs. Myers] Well, you can talk to him,
but what does--

08:18.744 --> 08:20.473
what does evaluating him--
what does that mean?

08:20.546 --> 08:24.642
[Loomis] Obviously, he's a very deranged
young mind that can do this to his pets.

08:24.717 --> 08:26.685
[Mrs. Myers]
You don't know that he did that.

08:29.054 --> 08:32.386
Fuck, man, if I get one more fucking detention,
I'll be fucking expelled.

08:32.457 --> 08:33.857
My old man's gonna beat my ass.

08:33.926 --> 08:36.918

on the weekend so we don't get in trouble.

he's fucking dead.

08:54.980 --> 08:55.969

Please no!

10:31.243 --> 10:34.212
Don't hurt me. Just-- I'm sorry.

No, no, no, don't.
Don't. Please. Please.

10:49.394 --> 10:51.487
Please.

38:54.878 --> 38:56.209
and done all manner of things,

38:56.280 --> 38:58.578
and I suppose that's because
you're a hard worker.

38:58.649 --> 39:00.412
Most of you people are.

40:01.244 --> 40:02.677
Don't look at me.

40:02.746 --> 40:06.238
I'll be a shitstorm
in your worst nightmare, motherfucker.

40:06.316 --> 40:09.444

41:06.309 --> 41:08.436
Michael...

41:08.545 --> 41:09.842
I have to move on.

41:12.015 --> 41:13.710
I'm sorry.

Take care.

These eyes will deceive you.

42:04.267 --> 42:07.168
They will destroy you.

They will take from you your innocence...

42:13.310 --> 42:16.438

one finds only blackness,

These are the eyes...

42:36.133 --> 42:38.795

Michael was created

42:40.837 --> 42:43.032

42:43.106 --> 42:46.269
of interior and exterior factors

42:46.343 --> 42:48.937

42:49.012 --> 42:53.779

55:00.076 --> 55:03.341
Just let the faceless marauding
corporate monsters of America

55:03.412 --> 55:05.107
destroy everything
beautiful about this town.

55:05.181 --> 55:08.514
Corporate monsters or not,
Epic Mart's a lot cheaper.

55:08.584 --> 55:10.745
Oh, man, I gotta get out of here.

55:14.657 --> 55:17.649
- Thanks again for dropping that thing off.
- No sweat, Dad.

55:17.727 --> 55:20.287
Just shove the envelope
inside the mail slot, okay?

55:20.363 --> 55:21.591
Yeah, Dad, I know.

55:21.664 --> 55:23.154
They're coming by to look at it later, honey.

55:23.232 --> 55:24.221
- So, it's very important that--
- Dad, okay.

55:24.300 --> 55:26.530
<i>I understand.
Muy importante.</i>

55:26.602 --> 55:27.660
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

55:27.737 --> 55:28.829
Have a good day.

55:28.905 --> 55:32.671
Mason, you forgot your briefcase, honey.

55:32.742 --> 55:34.903
- Ah, shit.
- Ah, shit.

55:34.977 --> 55:36.410
I feel like "What round is it?"

55:39.148 --> 55:40.274
Yeah.

55:40.349 --> 55:44.342
Oh, uh, you think you could...
glue Mr. Bones' arms on or something?

55:44.420 --> 55:47.753
- Have a good day, baby.
- Yeah. Top on my priority list.

55:51.294 --> 55:52.283
Hey, Laurie!

55:52.361 --> 55:53.419
- Wait up!
- Oh, God.

55:53.496 --> 55:56.397
- Leave me alone, Tommy.
- Wait.

55:56.465 --> 55:59.434
Definition: Stop walking.

55:59.502 --> 56:02.869
- Can I ask you something serious?
- Sure, why not?

56:02.939 --> 56:05.305
Did you ever hear
about the Mexican Wolf Man?

56:05.374 --> 56:07.433
- No.
- Yeah, well, he's real.

56:07.510 --> 56:09.034
- I saw him on TV last night...
- Yeah.

56:09.111 --> 56:12.877
And his name's Danny, and his face
is completely covered with hair.

56:12.949 --> 56:14.644
And he likes soccer.
I swear it! They showed--

56:14.717 --> 56:15.775
- Okay.
- He's a wolf!

56:15.851 --> 56:18.115
Tommy, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

56:18.187 --> 56:19.552
Lay off the candy corn, kid.

56:19.622 --> 56:22.147
Stop acting like I'm crazy. It's true!

56:22.224 --> 56:24.249
Tommy, I'm your babysitter.
You're crazy.

56:24.327 --> 56:26.818
- I know this. You're crazy.
- Ooohhh!

57:52.848 --> 57:55.112
[Laurie]
All right, gotta make a stop here.

57:55.184 --> 57:58.381
[Tommy]
Whoa! What are you, insane?

57:58.454 --> 58:00.888
Oh, my gosh, Tommy,
I'm not even listening to you.

58:00.956 --> 58:02.981
You'd better listen to me.

58:03.059 --> 58:04.253
He's right there.

58:04.326 --> 58:06.419
What are you, crazy?
You can't go in there.

58:06.495 --> 58:08.190
Oh, yes, I can.

58:08.264 --> 58:10.494
Hold my books, please?

58:11.934 --> 58:14.494
That's the devil's house.
The Boogey Man lives in there.

58:14.570 --> 58:16.629
Yeah.
Oh, no, Tommy.

58:16.706 --> 58:18.799
Don't even joke about it.
I'm serious.

58:18.874 --> 58:20.967
Oh, you're scaring me.

58:21.043 --> 58:24.274
The Boogey Man will get me
or Danny the Wolf Man.

58:30.786 --> 58:32.413
Oh, no, Tommy.

58:32.488 --> 58:35.252
Oh, no!

58:35.324 --> 58:36.951
Oh, no, it's pulling me--

58:37.026 --> 58:39.517
Oh, no, Tommy, it's pulling me in!

58:39.595 --> 58:41.529
Ha ha ha.

58:42.231 --> 58:43.698
It was just a joke. Chill.

58:43.766 --> 58:45.666
I wish it wasn't.

58:45.735 --> 58:47.566
Come on, hurry up.

58:47.636 --> 58:49.831
Chill, spazz-monkey.

58:49.905 --> 58:51.099
Thanks.

58:54.176 --> 58:56.144
That's no place to screw around,
Laurie.

58:56.212 --> 58:58.737
- It's not a big deal.
- Not a big deal?

58:58.814 --> 59:00.975
Do you know whose house that is?

59:01.050 --> 59:02.347
Come on.

59:02.418 --> 59:04.511
- It's going to be fine.
- Yeah.

59:04.587 --> 59:06.020
What if something happens?

59:06.088 --> 59:08.852
- Laurie, what is going to happen?
- I don't know.

59:08.924 --> 59:10.585
It's going to be fine.

59:10.659 --> 59:12.889
What is going to be fine?

59:12.962 --> 59:16.295
Annie wants me to pretend
to baby-sit Lindsey Wallace,

59:16.365 --> 59:19.926
then sneak out and dump her with me
so she can go and see Paul.

59:20.002 --> 59:21.367
Sounds like
one of my crafty ideas.

59:21.437 --> 59:22.665
- Yeah.
- I like it.

59:22.738 --> 59:25.605
Anyway, I thought Paul was, like, grounded
for trashing his dad's motorcycle.

59:25.674 --> 59:27.665
Oh, yeah.
No, he was, but he got out of it.

59:27.743 --> 59:29.005
- You know.
- Yeah.

59:29.078 --> 59:31.342
Please?

59:31.413 --> 59:32.778
What if they come home early?

59:32.848 --> 59:35.510
Dude, they are not
going to come home early.

59:35.584 --> 59:37.381
Okay? Mrs. Wallace is a lush.

59:37.453 --> 59:40.445
They're going to be out all night
getting hammered.

59:40.523 --> 59:43.390
Yeah. Annie, I really hate lying.
You know that.

59:43.459 --> 59:46.019
God, what are you, Mother Teresa?

59:46.095 --> 59:47.426
- No.
- Yes, she is.

59:47.496 --> 59:49.123
Look at her.
She's like a little angel.

59:49.198 --> 59:53.032
- She's Mother-fucking Teresa.
- Stop. I am not!

59:53.102 --> 59:54.592
Please?

59:57.373 --> 59:59.307
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes!

59:59.375 --> 01:00:00.569
You owe me big time.

01:00:00.643 --> 01:00:02.577
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:08.680
Did you know that ethyl alcohol
boils at 78.5 degrees Celsius?

01:00:08.751 --> 01:00:10.218
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

01:00:10.286 --> 01:00:11.753
That's pretty cool, right?

01:00:12.755 --> 01:00:13.847
Call me back.

01:00:17.259 --> 01:00:19.090
This is all your fault.

01:00:19.161 --> 01:00:20.992
I mean, you're responsible.

01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:27.459
I cannot be responsible
for everything that goes on in here.

01:00:27.536 --> 01:00:29.003
- What about you?
- No, no, no, no.

01:00:29.071 --> 01:00:31.039
You're not pinning this on me.

01:00:31.106 --> 01:00:34.803
- He was your patient, Doctor.
- Was my patient.

01:00:34.877 --> 01:00:38.335
Look, all you guys had to do
was to play zoo-keeper.

01:00:38.414 --> 01:00:41.872
Just keep the monkeyhouse locked
until the monkey died of old age.

01:00:41.951 --> 01:00:43.418
How difficult is that?

01:00:43.485 --> 01:00:47.319
Christ, you can barely tell
he's breathing half the time.

01:00:47.389 --> 01:00:51.189
He's been like a comatose kitty
for 15 years.

01:00:51.260 --> 01:00:54.093
If our security wasn't sufficient, Sammy,

01:00:54.163 --> 01:00:55.960
you should have warned us.

01:00:56.031 --> 01:01:00.297
I see. So you're just going
to wash your hands of the whole thing.

01:01:00.369 --> 01:01:03.202
You know, you two make me sick.

01:01:11.347 --> 01:01:15.681
"He is mad that trusts
in the tameness of a wolf."

01:01:17.386 --> 01:01:20.014
We've given the authorities
his complete profile.

01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:23.581
Two road blocks and an all-points bulletin
wouldn't stop a 5-year-old.

01:01:23.659 --> 01:01:25.320
Well, what do you want us to do?

01:01:25.394 --> 01:01:27.385
Yes. I mean,
what do you want us to do?

01:01:28.864 --> 01:01:30.832
I want you to get on the phone,

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.597
and I want you to tell them
who broke out of here last night.

01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:38.128
And I want you to tell them
exactly where he's going.

01:01:38.207 --> 01:01:39.674
Christ, we don't know where he's going.

01:01:39.742 --> 01:01:41.835
It must be great living in denial.

01:01:41.911 --> 01:01:43.503
I must try it sometime.

01:01:43.579 --> 01:01:47.276
Look, you and that army
of shirt-tuckers up there,

01:01:47.349 --> 01:01:49.317
you know damn well where he's going.

01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:52.110
And where is that?

01:01:55.491 --> 01:01:57.322
Haddonfield!

01:01:57.393 --> 01:02:00.157
Haddonfield's a hundred miles
away from here.

01:02:00.229 --> 01:02:01.355
[School bell rings]

01:02:01.430 --> 01:02:02.692
This is so fucked.

01:02:02.765 --> 01:02:04.892
What, me suspended from the squad?

01:02:04.967 --> 01:02:06.161
I don't mean to sound conceited,

01:02:06.235 --> 01:02:08.396
but I'm, like, the fucking hottest
cheerleader they've got.

01:02:08.470 --> 01:02:10.199
Yeah, Lynda,
that doesn't sound conceited.

01:02:10.272 --> 01:02:12.172
What, so now nobody
can take a joke anymore?

01:02:12.241 --> 01:02:13.868
- What did you say?
- Check it.

01:02:13.943 --> 01:02:16.537
So Lady Fuck-face gives us
three new cheers to learn,

01:02:16.612 --> 01:02:20.571
so I'm like, "Hey, why don't we just
rock it commando, flash some snatch?

01:02:20.649 --> 01:02:22.708
And maybe nobody will notice
we're doing the same old tired cheers."

01:02:22.785 --> 01:02:24.719
- Oh, you didn't.
- Oh, yeah, I did.

01:02:24.787 --> 01:02:25.776
- Yeah, you did.
- Yeah.

01:02:25.854 --> 01:02:27.549
You know what that
dried-up fucking bitch did?

01:02:27.623 --> 01:02:30.319
- What?
- Calls my dad and tells him what I said.

01:02:30.392 --> 01:02:31.381
- Yeah.
- Oh, my gosh.

01:02:31.460 --> 01:02:34.691
That C-U-N-T, yeah,
needs to get laid.

01:02:34.763 --> 01:02:36.390
What did your dad say?

01:02:36.465 --> 01:02:37.693
Oh, who cares?

01:02:37.766 --> 01:02:41.532
I'll just give him the little sweetie-pants
princess suck-up routine.

01:02:41.603 --> 01:02:44.834
Daddy's little pookie would never
say something like that.

01:02:44.907 --> 01:02:46.670
Gosh, ever since your parents split up,

01:02:46.742 --> 01:02:48.801
you have your dad
wrapped around your little finger.

01:02:48.877 --> 01:02:51.107
Totally wrapped.

01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.705
- Hey, bitches!
- Hey, Annie.

01:02:53.782 --> 01:02:57.445
- Thanks for waiting for me.
- Whatever. Hurry your ass up.

01:02:57.519 --> 01:02:59.248
God.

01:02:59.321 --> 01:03:02.552
Hey, I heard about your
little cheerleading incident.

01:03:02.624 --> 01:03:04.854
Yeah, I'm totally famous.

01:03:04.927 --> 01:03:06.554
You're totally a slut.

01:03:06.628 --> 01:03:08.152
Yeah.
[Laughs]

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:10.061
Anyway, today in class,
in French class,

01:03:10.132 --> 01:03:12.100
Mr. Leclerc was totally
flirting with me.

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:16.069
- God, here we go!
- We were conjugating the verb "to want."

01:03:16.138 --> 01:03:19.904
<i>- Because he so wants you!
- Je veuxl Je veuxl</i>

01:03:19.975 --> 01:03:22.773
- Oh, my gosh.
- Bare Leclerc.

01:03:22.845 --> 01:03:24.472
Bare Leclerc wants me.

01:03:24.546 --> 01:03:26.446
I think that guy's watching us.

01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:28.176
- What guy?
- That guy over there.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.342
Yeah?

01:03:29.418 --> 01:03:31.215
- Oh, please.
- I saw him outside school earlier.

01:03:31.286 --> 01:03:33.311
Probably just some pervert
cruising school poontang.

01:03:33.389 --> 01:03:35.448
Yeah, wait. Watch this.

01:03:35.524 --> 01:03:37.048
Hey, freak!

01:03:37.126 --> 01:03:38.991
Hey, freak, you want
some of the young stuff?

01:03:39.061 --> 01:03:40.961
You like that?
Well, come and get it.

01:03:41.030 --> 01:03:42.156
- Hey!
- Lynda, stop.

01:03:42.231 --> 01:03:44.563
Hey, asshole.
My daddy's the sheriff.

01:03:44.633 --> 01:03:47.033
Huh? Why don't you go crawl back
under your fucking rock?

01:03:47.102 --> 01:03:49.662
- Yeah, whatever.
- See, I told you.

01:03:49.738 --> 01:03:51.672
He's just some
stupid fucking pervert.

01:03:51.740 --> 01:03:53.765
- Total pervert.
- Gosh, you guys are crazy.

01:03:53.842 --> 01:03:55.104
That guy could have been dangerous.

01:03:55.177 --> 01:03:56.405
- Oh, God.
- Whatever.

01:03:56.478 --> 01:03:58.275
- What is he going to do?
- I don't know.

01:03:58.347 --> 01:04:01.839
Oh, my God.
You should date him!

01:04:03.285 --> 01:04:05.219
- You should!
- You guys!

01:04:05.287 --> 01:04:06.379
Come on, let's go get something--

01:04:06.455 --> 01:04:07.513
[horn honks]

01:04:07.589 --> 01:04:09.614
- Oh, no, 5-0.
- Hey.

01:04:09.691 --> 01:04:11.249
Hi, Dad.

01:04:11.326 --> 01:04:12.850
Hey, Mr. Brackett.

01:04:12.928 --> 01:04:15.829
- Nice furry hat, Mr. Brackett.
- Thank you.

01:04:15.898 --> 01:04:17.160
What's up, Dad?

01:04:17.232 --> 01:04:19.928
I'm on my way home.
Anybody want a ride?

01:04:20.002 --> 01:04:21.469
Yeah. Hell, yeah, I'll take a ride.

01:04:21.537 --> 01:04:22.697
- No.
- You guys?

01:04:22.771 --> 01:04:24.261
Bacon-mobiles make me nauseous.

01:04:24.339 --> 01:04:25.897
- Nice.
- Bye, Annie.

01:04:25.974 --> 01:04:27.441
- See you later.
- Bye, guys.

01:04:27.509 --> 01:04:29.374
Hey, kiddo.

01:04:32.281 --> 01:04:35.682
- Kind of a drag having a pig as a dad.
- Nah, I like him.

01:04:35.751 --> 01:04:38.219
Yeah? Do you think
he was flirting with me?

01:04:38.287 --> 01:04:40.118
- You are so demented.
- Totally.

01:04:40.189 --> 01:04:42.487
- Yeah. See ya.
- Bye.

01:05:18.494 --> 01:05:21.327
- I hate you!
- [Laughs]

01:05:26.468 --> 01:05:28.595
Aw, how cute.

01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:30.831
Would you please help me
with this stupid thing?

01:05:30.906 --> 01:05:32.737
Okay, okay, okay.

01:05:32.808 --> 01:05:35.902
Jeez. Mom, why do you
deal with this every year?

01:05:35.978 --> 01:05:38.037
Because for some unbelievable reason,

01:05:38.113 --> 01:05:40.877
your father likes it.

- The feet look like the hands--
- It's not working.

01:05:43.051 --> 01:05:46.248
And the hands like the feet,
and I can't get the thing in the hole, and--

01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:49.347
- Oh, I can't get it!
- Calm down, I'm helping--

01:05:49.424 --> 01:05:50.789
Oh, I got it.

01:05:52.361 --> 01:05:53.828
- You got it?
- Will you try and get those right?

01:05:53.896 --> 01:05:55.363
Okay, I'll try.

01:05:55.430 --> 01:05:56.590
Oh, jeez.

01:05:56.665 --> 01:05:59.828
I've been out here
for two hours doing this.

01:05:59.902 --> 01:06:01.870
There.

01:06:02.004 --> 01:06:04.404
- Hey, do you want me to get--
- Just hang himself. No!

01:06:04.473 --> 01:06:07.203
I'm still upset about the whole
bagel thing this morning,

01:06:07.276 --> 01:06:08.265
if you want to know the truth.

01:06:08.343 --> 01:06:09.503
Mom, that was a joke.

01:06:09.578 --> 01:06:10.943
- Oh, yeah. Well, let me tell you.
- It was a joke.

01:06:11.013 --> 01:06:12.878
There are some things
moms don't need to hear.

01:06:12.948 --> 01:06:14.540
- Yeah, I'm 17.
- I know you're 17.

01:06:14.616 --> 01:06:17.414
You're the best, Mom.

01:06:22.891 --> 01:06:24.722
[Man]
Yeah, it's right over here.

01:06:26.128 --> 01:06:28.028
[Loomis on phone]
Yeah. Hello?

01:06:28.096 --> 01:06:30.496
Yes, uh, Sheriff Brackett, please.

01:06:30.566 --> 01:06:34.434
Dr. Samuel Loomis.
Yeah. Hello? He--

01:06:34.503 --> 01:06:39.065
Oh, sh-- ugh!
Can I borrow your cell phone?

01:06:39.141 --> 01:06:41.701
This thing's about as useful
as a row of Christmas puddings.

Oh, no. I don't have one.

Oh, yeah. Right.

01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:50.716
You know, I remember this mess
just like it happened yesterday?

01:06:50.786 --> 01:06:52.151
It was tragic.

01:06:52.221 --> 01:06:54.018
The poor woman,
I guess she couldn't stand the stress

01:06:54.089 --> 01:06:57.024
of being labeled "Satan's mother."

01:06:57.092 --> 01:06:59.526
I think she blew her fucking head off.

01:06:59.595 --> 01:07:01.426
I'm still amazed.

01:07:01.496 --> 01:07:04.988
A young boy like that
butchering all those people.

01:07:05.067 --> 01:07:08.935
And the doctor involved--
I think he wrote a book or something.

01:07:09.004 --> 01:07:10.494
Fucking blood money.

01:07:10.572 --> 01:07:12.335
Yeah, I read that book.
It was a masterpiece.

01:07:12.407 --> 01:07:15.069
- Now, are we close?
- Yes, it's just here. I gu--

01:07:16.578 --> 01:07:18.739

- What?

Jesus Christ!

01:07:21.683 --> 01:07:25.278

with my time than clean up this shit?

01:07:34.963 --> 01:07:37.796

Dude, it fucking totally sucks
that they're selling this place.

01:08:12.367 --> 01:08:14.892
It's reduced.
Maybe I can buy it.

01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:17.837
Yeah, with like, your $10 you have
in your piggy bank?

01:08:19.608 --> 01:08:21.599
It's a shithole anyway.

01:08:21.676 --> 01:08:23.167
I'm going to miss it.

01:08:23.245 --> 01:08:24.303
Don't worry, dude.

01:08:24.379 --> 01:08:26.745
We'll find another house to party in.

01:08:26.814 --> 01:08:29.783
Besides, I'm gonna
get the van all jacked up.

01:08:29.850 --> 01:08:32.615
You're gonna want to spend
more time in there anyway.

01:08:40.761 --> 01:08:42.662
[Passionate moaning]

01:08:50.104 --> 01:08:51.504
Wait, wait!

01:08:51.573 --> 01:08:53.734
Wait, just like that.

01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:56.243
Oh, God.

01:08:56.310 --> 01:08:57.403
Oh, wait. Wait.

- Wait, my calf is cramping, man.

01:09:01.515 --> 01:09:03.245
Why'd you stop?
Oh, God--

01:09:03.318 --> 01:09:05.183
Oh, fuck.

01:09:09.991 --> 01:09:12.050
A fucking little warning would be nice.

01:09:12.127 --> 01:09:14.788
- Fuck.
- I'm sorry.

01:09:14.863 --> 01:09:16.831
Jesus.

01:09:20.602 --> 01:09:22.968
- Get me another beer.
- You get it.

01:09:23.037 --> 01:09:25.598
I'm the one that just did all the heavy lifting.

01:09:27.408 --> 01:09:28.876
All right, I'll go.

01:09:33.148 --> 01:09:37.778
So, seriously, on a scale from 1 to 10,
should I have a 5?

01:09:37.853 --> 01:09:42.256
How about... zero?

01:09:42.323 --> 01:09:43.484
- More like--
- Zero.

01:09:43.558 --> 01:09:44.786
More like zero plus 11.

01:10:31.206 --> 01:10:33.731
I was just thinking about
what Annie said earlier today,

01:10:33.809 --> 01:10:36.141
concerning my so-called
"cheerleading incident."

01:10:36.211 --> 01:10:38.042
I don't know.
It's kind of bumming me out.

all the empties back in here?

Come on, that's ridiculous.

01:10:49.024 --> 01:10:51.652
I don't give a shit what Annie thinks anyway.

such a fucking jerk every time we do it?

to run around looking like that.

and attacks kids who don't believe.

You know what, Tommy?

01:17:40.768 --> 01:17:42.736
It is true.

01:18:23.578 --> 01:18:25.603
What? She can't come over here!

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.478
- What if the guys see her?
- So?

01:18:28.549 --> 01:18:30.016
One, she's a girl.

01:18:30.084 --> 01:18:32.211
Two, she's not a boy.

01:18:32.287 --> 01:18:33.948
And three, she smells like you.

01:18:34.022 --> 01:18:37.423
This is going to be a long night.

01:18:37.492 --> 01:18:38.823
For the both of us.

01:18:39.827 --> 01:18:40.816
- Don't start with me.
- Uh, uh.

01:18:40.895 --> 01:18:42.920
What's the matter with you?

01:19:09.557 --> 01:19:12.355
Lindsey... get your coat on.

01:19:12.427 --> 01:19:14.361
We're going to go over
and see Tommy Doyal.

01:19:14.429 --> 01:19:16.192
Okay.

01:19:23.671 --> 01:19:26.606
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:19:26.674 --> 01:19:29.006
Yeah, exactly.
I said get your coat on.

01:19:29.077 --> 01:19:33.138
We're going over to your late-night lover
Tommy Doyal's house.

01:19:33.214 --> 01:19:34.340
No, you didn't.

01:19:34.415 --> 01:19:35.677
Yes, I did.

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:37.741
No, you didn't.

01:19:37.819 --> 01:19:42.256
Don, I'm sorry if I don't
sound too concerned,

01:19:42.323 --> 01:19:46.419
but a dead coyote and a missing headstone
doesn't prove anything.

01:19:46.494 --> 01:19:47.518
Well, I think you're wrong, Sheriff.

01:19:47.595 --> 01:19:50.291
I think it does prove
that he's here in Haddonfield.

01:19:50.365 --> 01:19:52.925
It was a Halloween prank.

01:19:53.001 --> 01:19:55.299
Kids pull shit like that all the time.

01:19:55.370 --> 01:19:56.894
The stone will be returned tomorrow.

01:19:56.971 --> 01:19:59.030
And besides, it weighs over half a ton.

01:19:59.107 --> 01:20:01.575
That's my point exactly.

01:20:01.642 --> 01:20:05.578
So you're saying that one man picked it up
and walked away with it?

01:20:05.646 --> 01:20:06.772
Yes.

01:20:06.848 --> 01:20:09.544
Doc, I may have been born,
but I wasn't born yesterday.

01:20:09.617 --> 01:20:12.882
I'm sorry, Sheriff,
but please listen to me.

01:20:12.954 --> 01:20:15.184
This may be a matter of life and death.

01:20:15.256 --> 01:20:18.384
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.

01:20:18.459 --> 01:20:20.256
You come by my office tomorrow--

01:20:20.328 --> 01:20:22.762
Tomorrow is too late.

01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:25.094
Evil is here.

01:20:25.166 --> 01:20:26.997
It's walking amongst us.

01:20:27.068 --> 01:20:30.060
Doc, it sounds to me like
you're talking about the Antichrist.

01:20:30.138 --> 01:20:32.698
Well, perhaps I am.

01:20:32.774 --> 01:20:33.763
Smell my feet

01:20:33.841 --> 01:20:35.502
Give me something good to eat

01:20:35.576 --> 01:20:37.373
If you don't, I don't care

01:20:37.445 --> 01:20:39.379
I'll pull down Annie's underwear

01:20:39.447 --> 01:20:42.575
I can't believe you're making me
haul this thing all the way over there.

01:20:42.650 --> 01:20:46.086
I can't believe you think
I'm not going to tell.

01:20:47.188 --> 01:20:50.021
Gonna share some popcorn
with your little boyfriend?

01:20:50.091 --> 01:20:51.956
No, I'm not.

01:20:52.026 --> 01:20:53.550
You know you are.

01:20:53.628 --> 01:20:56.290
You know you're going
to share something with Paul.

01:20:56.364 --> 01:20:58.559
You know how annoying you are?

01:20:58.633 --> 01:21:00.498
How?

01:21:00.568 --> 01:21:02.627
Trick or treat, smell my feet.

01:21:02.703 --> 01:21:04.432
Give me something good to eat

01:21:04.505 --> 01:21:07.497
- If you don't, I don't care--
- I swear to God, Lindsey.

01:21:07.575 --> 01:21:09.065
If you don't stop singing that song,

01:21:09.143 --> 01:21:10.974
we're going to have
a pumpkin-smashing party

01:21:11.045 --> 01:21:12.774
right here in the middle of the street.

01:21:12.847 --> 01:21:14.747
[Doorbell rings]

01:21:21.622 --> 01:21:23.852
Tommy, where's your girlfriend Laurie?

01:21:23.925 --> 01:21:26.291
Laurie's not my girlfriend.
I hate girls.

01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.555
Why doesn't anyone understand this?

01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:30.221
Good. So does Lindsey.

01:21:30.298 --> 01:21:31.993
Go worship your god.

01:21:32.066 --> 01:21:34.466
- Hey.
- Brought you a present.

01:21:34.535 --> 01:21:36.162
Thanks.

01:21:36.237 --> 01:21:39.331
You, my dear, will be happy to know

01:21:39.407 --> 01:21:42.376
that I talked to Paul
about his buddy Ben Tramer.

01:21:42.443 --> 01:21:44.934
Oh, I thought you said
Ben Tramer was retarded.

01:21:45.012 --> 01:21:49.142
<i>Yeah, but he's not
Shortbus retarded or anything.</i>

01:21:49.217 --> 01:21:50.275
What? He's okay.

01:21:50.351 --> 01:21:53.980
- I mean, you need a boyfriend!
- Annie, I don't need a boyfriend.

01:21:54.055 --> 01:21:55.386
- No, that's not what I meant.
- I'm fine.

01:21:55.456 --> 01:21:57.048
- You need--
- Okay, Annie--

01:21:57.125 --> 01:21:58.956
Oh! Oh! Yes!

01:21:59.026 --> 01:22:00.050
Yes, Annie!

01:22:00.128 --> 01:22:02.323
Okay, ok--

01:22:02.396 --> 01:22:03.658
All right, you're right.

01:22:03.731 --> 01:22:04.993
I need a boyfriend.

01:22:05.066 --> 01:22:06.829
So, what did he say?

01:22:06.901 --> 01:22:09.836
He said, and I quote,

01:22:09.904 --> 01:22:13.362
"Dude, she's fucking hot."

01:22:13.441 --> 01:22:15.341
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

01:22:18.246 --> 01:22:20.009
[Honks horn]

01:22:20.081 --> 01:22:22.242
Oh, fuck, that's Paul.
I gotta go.

01:22:22.316 --> 01:22:24.147
- Have fun.
- Thanks, I will.

01:22:24.218 --> 01:22:25.879
- Bye, sexy.
- Bye.

01:22:31.626 --> 01:22:32.888
Hi, baby.

01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.518
- What's up?
- How are you?

01:22:34.595 --> 01:22:35.687
I'm good.
How are you?

01:22:35.763 --> 01:22:36.923
Good.

01:22:37.665 --> 01:22:41.624
You have to stop thinking
that we're dealing with a normal man here.

01:22:41.702 --> 01:22:44.967
We're dealing with
a soulless killing machine,

01:22:45.039 --> 01:22:47.667
driven by pure animal instinct.

01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:52.812
Dr. Loomis, I'm going
to have to level with you.

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:54.745
I read your book.

01:22:54.815 --> 01:22:57.613
I know exactly who you are,
and frankly, I don't like you.

01:22:57.685 --> 01:22:59.516
And I'll tell you something else.

01:22:59.587 --> 01:23:03.250
I think you have created
quite the masterpiece of a monster

01:23:03.324 --> 01:23:08.728
off the blood of this town,
because monsters sell books.

01:23:08.796 --> 01:23:13.199
Please, just look at this photograph
on the cover of the book.

01:23:13.267 --> 01:23:14.359
All right.

01:23:16.337 --> 01:23:19.773
I first met Michael 17 years ago.

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:25.403
When I first met him,
he was a sweet, charming little boy.

01:23:25.479 --> 01:23:29.176
But he had nothing inside.

01:23:29.250 --> 01:23:31.878
There was something missing, a void.

01:23:31.953 --> 01:23:35.514
There was no conscience, no reason,

01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:41.187
even a rudimentary sense
of life or death, right or wrong.

01:23:41.262 --> 01:23:45.028
Yeah. He's come back for her.

01:23:45.099 --> 01:23:49.468
And who is her?

01:23:49.537 --> 01:23:53.098
He's come back for his baby sister.

01:23:53.174 --> 01:23:55.972
I know it in my bones, Sheriff.

01:23:57.545 --> 01:23:58.876
To do what?

01:24:02.450 --> 01:24:04.680
I don't know, Sheriff, but...

01:24:06.053 --> 01:24:08.283
it's not good.

01:24:12.326 --> 01:24:16.228
If I break a promise I made a long time ago,

01:24:16.297 --> 01:24:19.733
then you must promise that you will play it

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:23.463
razor, and I mean razor, straight with me.

01:24:23.537 --> 01:24:24.526
[Telephone rings]

01:24:26.841 --> 01:24:29.469
<i>[Mr. Strode, on machine]
Hello. You have reached
the Strode residence.</i>

01:24:29.543 --> 01:24:32.307
<i>[Mrs. Strode]
We can't come to the phone right now.</i>

01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:36.407
<i>[Mr. Strode]
So please leave a message and have a...</i>

01:24:36.484 --> 01:24:40.284
<i>[both]
Happy Halloweenl</i>

01:24:40.354 --> 01:24:41.582
<i>[beep]</i>

01:24:42.523 --> 01:24:45.253
Yeah, this is Sheriff Brackett. Hello?

01:24:45.326 --> 01:24:46.793
If you can hear me, pick up.

01:24:46.861 --> 01:24:51.628
<i>Please, if you can hear me,
I need to talk to you immediately.</i>

01:24:53.934 --> 01:24:55.561
[Hangs up phone]

01:24:57.805 --> 01:24:58.794
Let's go.

01:24:58.873 --> 01:25:01.808
- Laurie?
- What, Tommy?

01:25:01.876 --> 01:25:06.336
I would like to return to the subject
we started earlier this evening.

01:25:06.414 --> 01:25:07.938
What? Your hatred of peanut butter?

01:25:08.015 --> 01:25:10.176
No, the Boogey Man.

01:25:10.251 --> 01:25:12.412
I need some closure on this topic.

01:25:12.486 --> 01:25:14.010
I've heard all about this.

01:25:14.088 --> 01:25:16.488
What do you want to know, Tommy?

01:25:16.557 --> 01:25:18.855
Why would he only attack kids
who don't believe?

01:25:18.926 --> 01:25:21.053
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

01:25:21.128 --> 01:25:23.722
Is it because if you believe,
then you're protected by his powers?

01:25:23.798 --> 01:25:25.732
Okay, Tommy,
enough about the Boogey Man.

01:25:25.800 --> 01:25:26.858
It's nonsense.

01:25:26.934 --> 01:25:29.664
I'm with Tommy on this one.

01:25:29.737 --> 01:25:33.730
Yeah. Why do you keep
avoiding the subject, Laurie?

01:25:33.808 --> 01:25:35.605
Is-- Is she scared?

01:25:35.676 --> 01:25:36.904
- Maybe she is.
- Ooh, yeah.

01:25:36.977 --> 01:25:39.138
- Maybe you're scared!
- Are you scared?

01:25:39.213 --> 01:25:40.908
Okay, stop! Stop!

01:25:40.981 --> 01:25:44.508
Leave me alone for five seconds, please.

01:25:44.585 --> 01:25:47.383
- Five, four, three...
- You guys...

01:25:47.455 --> 01:25:49.582
- Okay, please don't.
- Two, one.

01:25:49.657 --> 01:25:51.181
No! No!

01:25:51.258 --> 01:25:52.885
I'm going to tell your parents!

01:25:56.597 --> 01:25:59.589
Hey, don't pull it like that.
You're going to stretch it all out.

01:25:59.667 --> 01:26:03.660
- Come on, munchie.
- Stop. This is expensive, idiot.

01:26:13.114 --> 01:26:14.979
- You want to fuck me?
- Yeah.

01:26:15.049 --> 01:26:16.778
- Yeah?
- You're so fucking hot, babe.

01:26:16.851 --> 01:26:19.718
You want to fuck me?
I want to hear you say it.

01:26:19.787 --> 01:26:21.277
- I'm gonna fuck you.
- Yeah?

01:26:21.355 --> 01:26:22.754
Say it again.

01:26:27.294 --> 01:26:29.489
It's so fucking warm.

01:26:55.990 --> 01:26:57.582
Oh, my--

01:26:57.658 --> 01:26:58.750
What's the matter?

But the movie's not over.

01:28:23.777 --> 01:28:25.404
You can finish watching the movie
at your house.

01:28:25.479 --> 01:28:28.471
- How about during the commercial break?
- Negative.

01:28:28.549 --> 01:28:29.846
Go get your jacket!

01:28:29.917 --> 01:28:33.182
You heard her, girl.
Keep on marching.

01:28:33.254 --> 01:28:35.552
Ugh! I am Queen Sheba, okay?

01:28:35.623 --> 01:28:39.525
- Bow down and worship me.
- Go get your jacket.

01:28:41.529 --> 01:28:43.258
Are you sure you're okay
while I take Lindsey home?

01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:45.821
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure, little Tommy?

01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:49.392
- You'll be by yourself!
- I'm fine, now stop asking!

01:28:49.470 --> 01:28:50.459
- Are you sure?
- Yes!

01:28:50.538 --> 01:28:52.836
- He's scared.
- No, I'm not.

01:28:52.907 --> 01:28:54.272
- Yes, you are.
- Shut up.

01:28:54.341 --> 01:28:57.139
Okay, you guys. Stop.

01:28:57.211 --> 01:29:00.112
Behave, Tommy-Wommy.
[Giggling]

01:29:00.347 --> 01:29:02.440
[Siren wailing]

01:29:02.516 --> 01:29:06.680
About 17 years ago,
I respond to a 911

01:29:06.754 --> 01:29:09.746
which turned out to be
the Myers woman's suicide.

01:29:09.823 --> 01:29:14.920
And I see this beautiful,
innocent baby sitting in this bloody mess,

01:29:14.995 --> 01:29:18.158
and I can't imagine this child growing up
with a stigma around her neck,

01:29:18.732 --> 01:29:24.534
so I omit her from the report,
I drive her to another town,

01:29:24.605 --> 01:29:26.869
and drop her off
at the nearest emergency room.

01:29:26.941 --> 01:29:28.772
And I think that this
is going to be the end of it.

01:29:28.842 --> 01:29:31.709
About three months later,
I find out from a friend of mine,

01:29:31.779 --> 01:29:34.839
Mason Strode,
that he's adopted the baby.

01:29:34.915 --> 01:29:36.177
Oh, my God.

01:29:44.658 --> 01:29:46.387
- Cold?
- Yeah.

01:29:46.460 --> 01:29:47.950
Okay, come here.

01:29:50.130 --> 01:29:52.257
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

01:29:52.333 --> 01:29:54.164
You sure?

01:29:54.234 --> 01:29:55.462
