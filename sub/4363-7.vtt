WEBVTT

00:07.478 --> 00:09.510
I SAW SOMEONE DROWNING ME.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.783
HOW DO I ATONE FOR SOMETHING
I HAVEN'T DONE YET?

00:12.783 --> 00:16.016
THE MAN YOU MIGHT BE SLEEPING
WITH IN SIX MONTHS' TIME

00:16.016 --> 00:19.190
WAS JUST IN OUR LIVING ROOM,
AND I SURE AS HELL

00:19.190 --> 00:22.523
DIDN'T BRING HIM
INTO OUR LIVES. YOU DID!
ALL THE OLD PATTERNS ARE BACK,
MARK.

00:22.523 --> 00:26.327
IT'S ABOUT TRUST, AND WE DON'T
TRUST EACH OTHER ANYMORE.
I HAD A VISION OF FIONA BANKS.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.300
LET'S SEE IF SHE
HAD A VISION OF ME.
AL, I KNOW WHY YOU'RE CALLING.

00:29.300 --> 00:31.802
It's something to do
with the Rutherford case.

00:31.802 --> 00:33.504
(Demetri) LISTEN, AL,

00:33.504 --> 00:35.806
YOU'VE BEEN ACTING KIND OF WEIRD
FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS YOURSELF.

00:35.806 --> 00:38.439
BLUE HAND--IT'S A CLUE
FROM MARK'S BOARD.

00:49.350 --> 00:51.552
(man) DEAR CELIA,

00:51.552 --> 00:54.285
I DON'T KNOW YOUR LAST NAME,

00:54.285 --> 00:56.527
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU LIVE,

00:56.527 --> 00:59.730
BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE
TWO YOUNG BOYS--

00:59.730 --> 01:02.393
TWINS, I BELIEVE.

01:02.393 --> 01:04.365
(children's laughter)

01:04.365 --> 01:06.837
AND I KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A FLASH-FORWARD.

01:06.837 --> 01:10.671
I UNDERSTAND
HOW TERRIFYING THAT IS

01:10.671 --> 01:13.073
AND HOW POWERLESS
YOU MUST BE FEELING.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.706
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.197
E-MAILING
YOUR OTHER GIRLFRIENDS?

01:36.197 --> 01:39.630
NO, WE, UH, WE BROKE UP.
THIS IS JUST PORN.

01:39.630 --> 01:41.632
OH, OKAY.
YEAH. (chuckles)

01:41.632 --> 01:44.235
I'M IN PRE-TRIAL CONFERENCE
ALL DAY, SO TOTALLY UNREACHABLE,

01:44.235 --> 01:46.677
BUT DON'T FORGET WE NEED
TO SIGN OFF ON THE PROOFS LATER.

01:46.677 --> 01:48.679
PROOFS?
FOR THE WEDDING INVITATIONS.

01:48.679 --> 01:51.412
RIGHT.
BET YOU 20 BUCKS
THEY SPELL MY NAME WRONG.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.614
BET YOU $100
THEY GOT MINE WRONG.

01:53.614 --> 01:56.487
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY COUPLES
WITH COMMONLY MISSPELLED NAMES

01:56.487 --> 01:58.549
ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL.

01:58.549 --> 01:59.890
REALLY?

01:59.890 --> 02:01.852
MM-HMM.

02:01.852 --> 02:04.525
MEET ME AT THE PRINTERS
AT 6:00, OKAY?

02:04.525 --> 02:07.528
CAN'T YOU JUST PICK ONE?

02:07.528 --> 02:09.600
I'M GONNA PRETEND
I DIDN'T HEAR THAT.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.602
I'M JUST SAYING
YOU HAVE GREAT TASTE.

02:11.602 --> 02:13.704
I MEAN, I DON'T NEED
TO BE THERE, RIGHT?

02:13.704 --> 02:17.408
HEY, KICK ASS TODAY.

02:17.408 --> 02:19.870
(door closes)

02:24.845 --> 02:26.577
(beep)

02:26.577 --> 02:30.481
I MIGHT BE HOME
A LITTLE LATE TONIGHT.

02:30.481 --> 02:34.255
I'M COVERING THE E.R.
FOR SALLY AGAIN.

02:34.255 --> 02:36.257
I TRIED TO GET OUT
OF IT, BUT--

02:36.257 --> 02:38.459
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.661
IT'S JUST HARD
'CAUSE CROSBY'S OUT OF TOWN,

02:40.661 --> 02:42.663
SO THERE REALLY IS
NO ONE ELSE.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.665
OLIVIA,
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.337
I TRUST YOU.

02:46.337 --> 02:48.339
GOOD.

02:48.339 --> 02:50.341
I TRUST YOU, TOO.

02:55.846 --> 02:57.848
(glass shatters)

02:57.848 --> 03:01.682
IT'S LIKE EVERYTHING I SAY
COMES OUT WRONG--EVERYTHING.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.685
EVEN WHEN WE'RE GETTING ALONG,
IT'S TENSE.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.187
THINGS HAVE CHANGED FOR
EVERYBODY. IT'S A NEW WORLD.

03:07.187 --> 03:09.890
YEAH? I MISS THE OLD ONE THEN.

03:09.890 --> 03:12.823
REALLY? THE ONE WHERE YOU
USED TO CRASH ON MY COUCH

03:12.823 --> 03:14.825
PLAYING "MADDEN"
TILL 4:00 A.M.?

03:14.825 --> 03:17.598
DON'T YOU MEAN FUTON, AND DON'T
YOU MEAN KICKING YOUR ASS

03:17.598 --> 03:20.771
UNTIL 4:00 A.M.?
WHAT?

03:20.771 --> 03:23.704
WHAT? I SAID IT. (laughs)
NO, YOU DIDN'T KICK ANYTHING.
YOU WERE--YOU WERE CHEATING.

03:23.704 --> 03:27.278
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE DOING.
HEY, MAN,
WHAT YOU CALL CHEATING

03:27.278 --> 03:29.410
I CALL FINDING A WAY
TO CHANGE THE GAME, MY FRIEND.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.382
OH.
(elevator bell dings)

03:31.382 --> 03:34.415
HOW'S AGENT HAWK DOING?

03:34.415 --> 03:36.417
SHE'S OUT OF THE WOODS.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.420
SHOULD BE BACK TO WORK
IN A FEW WEEKS.
YOU THINK THESE THREE

03:39.420 --> 03:41.422
HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH HER SHOOTING?

03:41.422 --> 03:44.224
WELL, WE FOLLOWED THE HAND STAMP
FROM THE GUY WHO SHOT JANIS,

03:44.224 --> 03:46.757
LED US TO THE HOUSE
WHERE WE FOUND THESE GUYS.

03:46.757 --> 03:48.359
THE BLUE HAND STAMP?

03:48.359 --> 03:51.001
(Demetri) MM-HMM.
I'M SENSING A THEME.

03:51.001 --> 03:53.264
YEAH? YOU WANT TO SHARE?
THE CONTACT RING,

03:53.264 --> 03:55.566
RESIDUE PATTERNS
AND BULLET TRAJECTORIES

03:55.566 --> 03:58.008
ARE CONSISTENT WITH
SELF-INFLICTED GUNSHOT WOUNDS.

03:58.008 --> 03:59.570
SELF-INFLICTED?

03:59.570 --> 04:02.843
WAS IT--YOU THINK THIS IS
SOME KIND OF SUICIDE PACT?

04:02.843 --> 04:04.675
HAD TO BE.

04:04.675 --> 04:07.678
BUT THEN WHO ARRANGED THE BODIES
AND COVERED THEM

04:07.678 --> 04:09.680
WITH THE SHEETS THAT NIGHT?

04:09.680 --> 04:11.682
ALL HAD ALCOHOL
IN THEIR SYSTEMS.

04:11.682 --> 04:14.925
SHE HAD ECSTASY AND HEROIN.
HEY, DEM, WHO--
WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE?

04:14.925 --> 04:18.028
UM, JASON MARTINEZ, 37.
MARRIED, 2 CHILDREN.

04:18.028 --> 04:21.932
THIS IS DIANA DAVIS. STILL
LOOKING FOR NEXT OF KIN, AND--

04:21.932 --> 04:24.695
AND IAN RUTHERFORD, 25.

04:24.695 --> 04:27.938
BRITISH NATIONAL. REPORTED
MISSING FROM A CARGO VESSEL

04:27.938 --> 04:29.900
DOCKED IN LONG BEACH.

04:32.042 --> 04:33.944
YOUR RUTHERFORD CASE?

04:33.944 --> 04:36.276
YEAH.

04:36.276 --> 04:39.680
(thud)

04:39.680 --> 04:41.682
HERE WE GO.

04:41.682 --> 04:49.360
â™ªâ™ª

04:49.360 --> 04:50.861
AARON.

04:50.861 --> 04:52.493
WHAT'S UP, JACK?

04:52.493 --> 04:54.495
THERE'S A GUY WAITING
FOR YOU INSIDE.

04:54.495 --> 04:56.497
SAYS HE SERVED WITH TRACY.

05:11.542 --> 05:13.313
(truck door opens)

05:15.586 --> 05:19.420
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

05:19.420 --> 05:22.022
YOU'RE AARON STARK?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.894
CORPORAL MIKE WILLINGHAM.

05:23.894 --> 05:26.557
I'VE BEEN MEANING TO COME
TALK TO YOU FOR A WHILE,

05:26.557 --> 05:29.029
BUT I'VE BEEN MIXED UP--
TRYING TO GET A JOB,

05:29.029 --> 05:32.062
TRYING TO GET A PLACE TO LIVE.
IT'S TOUGH READJUSTING
TO CIVILIAN LIFE.

05:32.062 --> 05:34.064
ESPECIALLY WITH THE WAY
THINGS ARE NOW.

05:34.064 --> 05:36.907
YOU JUST GOTTA HOPE
IT GETS BETTER.
YEAH.

05:36.907 --> 05:39.009
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU
AT YOUR PLACE OF WORK,

05:39.009 --> 05:42.042
BUT I PROMISED TRACY THAT IF
ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO HER,

05:42.042 --> 05:44.044
I'D GIVE YOU THIS.

05:45.876 --> 05:49.650
(whoosh)

05:51.422 --> 05:53.023
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

05:53.023 --> 05:55.726
I'LL ALWAYS FIND YOU,
KIDDO.

05:55.726 --> 06:00.661
I THINK RIGHT NOW
YOU NEED THIS MORE THAN I DO.

06:11.742 --> 06:14.004
(voice breaking)
I HADN'T SEEN THIS KNIFE

06:14.004 --> 06:16.707
SINCE TRACY DEPLOYED
FOUR YEARS AGO,

06:16.707 --> 06:19.980
BUT SOMEHOW...

06:19.980 --> 06:23.954
(whoosh)
IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,

06:23.954 --> 06:25.916
I WAS GIVING IT BACK TO HER.

06:25.916 --> 06:29.159
SHE SAID IT WAS
A GOOD LUCK CHARM.

06:29.159 --> 06:31.161
MAYBE THERE'S
SOMETHING TO THAT.

06:31.161 --> 06:33.894
FOR TWO YEARS, I'VE HAD
TO LISTEN TO PEOPLE

06:33.894 --> 06:35.966
TELLING ME TO MOVE ON,

06:35.966 --> 06:37.968
TO ACCEPT WHAT HAPPENED
TO HER.

06:37.968 --> 06:40.531
BUT I ALWAYS KNEW
I'D SEE HER AGAIN.

06:40.531 --> 06:43.874
NOW YOU
SHOWING UP HERE AND...

06:47.107 --> 06:49.740
IT'S ALL HAPPENING,
ISN'T IT?

06:49.740 --> 06:53.043
IT'S ALL HAPPENING.

06:56.747 --> 06:59.920
THANK YOU, MIKE.

06:59.920 --> 07:01.892
THANK YOU.

07:03.954 --> 07:07.898
WHY DO A COPY MACHINE SALESMAN,
A LIBRARIAN

07:07.898 --> 07:10.701
AND A SCOTTISH LONGSHOREMAN
ALL DECIDE TO GET TOGETHER

07:10.701 --> 07:13.433
TO SHOOT THEMSELVES?
BECAUSE PRINT IS DEAD?

07:13.433 --> 07:17.668
GOUGH, SAY HELLO TO YOUR VISION.
YOU ALL KNOW FIONA BANKS,

07:17.668 --> 07:20.941
MI6, FRESH OFF THE PLANE
FROM LONDON.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.874
NICE TO MEET YOU AGAIN...
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

07:23.874 --> 07:26.847
YEAH. NICE TO MEET YOU.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.980
SUICIDE SEEMS A LITTLE
LOW-INCIDENT FOR MI6.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.583
IAN RUTHERFORD
WAS REPORTED MISSING

07:32.583 --> 07:34.925
OFF A CARGO SHIP
TWO WEEKS AGO.

07:34.925 --> 07:36.827
THE BRITISH EMBASSY
WAS NOTIFIED.

07:36.827 --> 07:39.189
I SAW THE REPORT
AND CAME HERE BECAUSE--
'CAUSE YOU KNEW YOU'D BE

07:39.189 --> 07:41.662
WORKING ON THIS CASE
FROM YOUR FLASH-FORWARD.
THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD,

07:41.662 --> 07:45.165
BUT WHAT DO WE GOT
IN THE PRESENT?
WELL, WHEN I FOUND OUT ALL THREE
VICS COMMITTED SUICIDE,

07:45.165 --> 07:47.467
I CROSS-REFERENCED
THEIR VISIONS ON MOSAIC.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.771
TURNS OUT THEY'RE ALL GHOSTS.

07:50.771 --> 07:53.203
PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING
IN THEIR FLASH-FORWARDS--

07:53.203 --> 07:55.175
THAT'S WHAT
THEY CALL THEMSELVES.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.207
SO NONE OF THEM HAD VISIONS,
AND NOW THEY'RE ALL DEAD.

07:57.207 --> 08:00.511
AM I THE ONLY ONE
WHO FINDS THAT DISTURBING?

08:00.511 --> 08:01.982
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.885
HERE. CHECK THIS OUT.
(types)

08:04.885 --> 08:07.117
IT'S A GHOST WEB SITE.

08:07.117 --> 08:09.119
(beep)
IT'S WHERE THEY CONNECT
WITH EACH OTHER,

08:09.119 --> 08:14.024
FIND OUT ABOUT UPCOMING EVENTS.
ANCHORAGE,
BUENOS AIRES, DUBAI...

08:14.024 --> 08:15.896
WHATEVER THIS IS,
IT'S HAPPENING EVERYWHERE.

08:15.896 --> 08:18.228
(beep)
"THE BLUE HAND.
NO LIMITS. NO FEAR.

08:18.228 --> 08:21.602
A PLACE WHERE GHOSTS CAN GATHER
TO EMBRACE THE INEVITABLE."

08:21.602 --> 08:24.905
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
A DEATH CLUB?

08:24.905 --> 08:30.080
LIKE A BOOK CLUB
WITH BULLETS.
WHATEVER IT IS, THE GUY WHO
SHOT JANIS IS A PART OF IT.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.212
WE NEED TO FIND THESE PEOPLE,
FIGURE OUT WHO THEY ARE

08:32.212 --> 08:35.616
AND SHUT THEM DOWN.
THE NEXT MEETING IN LOS ANGELES
IS BEING HOSTED

08:35.616 --> 08:39.019
BY A GUY NAMED RAYNAUD--
DR. MAURICE RAYNAUD.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.951
WHEN'S THE MEETING?
(taps key)

08:40.951 --> 08:44.895
(man) TONIGHT GO DOWNTOWN
AND CHECK THE TIME.
(clock ticking)

08:44.895 --> 08:48.959
(taps key)
TONIGHT GO DOWNTOWN
AND CHECK THE TIME.

08:48.959 --> 08:53.764
TONIGHT GO DOWNTOWN
AND CHECK THE TIME.

09:02.813 --> 09:05.215
IAN BLAINE RUTHERFORD.

09:05.215 --> 09:08.048
BORN IN EDINBURGH, 1984.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.781
FATHER'S AN AVIATION MECHANIC.
MOTHER... UH--

09:10.781 --> 09:13.023
WORKS IN A FACTORY,
MAKES CELL PHONE COMPONENTS.

09:13.023 --> 09:16.286
I'VE ALREADY SEEN
THAT FILE.

09:16.286 --> 09:18.829
YES, OF COURSE.
(chuckles)

09:18.829 --> 09:21.762
SORRY. I JUST, UH, I NEVER
EXPECTED TO BE WORKING

09:21.762 --> 09:23.563
ON THIS CASE SO SOON.

09:23.563 --> 09:27.297
THE DOMINOS SEEM TO BE FALLING
INTO PLACE, DON'T THEY?

09:27.297 --> 09:29.299
IT'S FUNNY.

09:29.299 --> 09:32.703
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
FROM THE ACTUAL DOSSIER

09:32.703 --> 09:34.705
OTHER THAN HIS NAME.

09:34.705 --> 09:36.707
I JUST REMEMBER YOU...

09:36.707 --> 09:39.009
AND THE BIRD.

09:39.009 --> 09:41.011
(whoosh)
WHEN IT HIT THE WINDOW...

09:41.011 --> 09:43.914
(thud)
I LITERALLY FELT
MY HEART SKIP A BEAT.

09:43.914 --> 09:46.887
(whoosh)
THEN YOU HAD THE PHONE CALL..

09:46.887 --> 09:50.220
(cell phone rings)
EXCUSE ME FOR A MOMENT.

09:50.220 --> 09:54.594
AFTER YOU LEFT,
I LOOKED OUT ONTO THE LEDGE.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.097
I WENT OVER.

10:04.204 --> 10:09.209
I WANTED TO HELP IT,
IF ONLY TO END ITS PAIN.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.881
BUT I COULDN'T.

10:10.881 --> 10:13.113
THAT WAS THE WORST PART.

10:13.113 --> 10:17.988
THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO
TO STOP IT.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.295
(cell phone chimes)

10:28.328 --> 10:30.360
WHAT WAS
YOUR PHONE CALL ABOUT?

10:30.360 --> 10:33.033
IT WAS MY ATTORNEY.

10:33.033 --> 10:35.706
WHY WERE YOU SPEAKING
TO AN ATTORNEY?

10:35.706 --> 10:38.008
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?
(whoosh)

10:38.008 --> 10:41.942
(voice breaking)
I KILLED HER.

10:41.942 --> 10:45.075
(whoosh)
NO, EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

10:56.326 --> 10:58.258
HEY, BABE.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.991
HEY, I'M WORKING
DOWNTOWN TONIGHT.

11:00.991 --> 11:04.765
THOUGHT I MIGHT STOP BY THAT
BAKERY ON GRAND ON THE WAY BACK,

11:04.765 --> 11:07.297
PICK US UP SOME
OF THOSE CINNAMON ROLLS.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.843
(cork pops)
OR NOT.

11:12.843 --> 11:15.445
(wine pours)

11:15.445 --> 11:19.810
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA
WHY I'M MAD, DO YOU?

11:19.810 --> 11:21.311
NO.

11:21.311 --> 11:25.856
THE PRINTERS?
OUR INVITATIONS?

11:25.856 --> 11:27.858
OH, MY GOD.
I'M SO SORRY.

11:27.858 --> 11:29.860
WORK WAS SO CRAZY.

11:29.860 --> 11:32.823
ALL RIGHT? WE GOT A LEAD
ON THE GUY WHO SHOT JANIS,

11:32.823 --> 11:35.125
AND NOW WE'RE GOING
TO THIS UNDERGROUND CLUB--

11:35.125 --> 11:38.068
YEAH, YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO HAD A CRAZY DAY.

11:38.068 --> 11:40.831
I'VE BEEN CRANKING OUT MOTIONS
IN LIMINE ALL AFTERNOON

11:40.831 --> 11:43.133
BUT SOMEHOW MADE IT
TO THE PRINTERS ANYWAY.

11:43.133 --> 11:46.476
YOU'RE RIGHT. I SUCK.
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN THERE.

11:46.476 --> 11:48.478
I'M REALLY SORRY.

11:48.478 --> 11:50.480
IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE INVITATIONS, DEM.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.482
IT'S ABOUT YOU AND ME

11:52.482 --> 11:54.785
AND THE FACT THAT
YOU'VE BEEN CHECKED OUT

11:54.785 --> 11:59.119
EVER SINCE I GOT HOME
FROM SEATTLE.
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN SLAMMED
SINCE THE BLACKOUT.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.291
BABE, PLEASE.
SINCE THE BLACKOUT, YEAH.

12:01.291 --> 12:03.824
THAT'S BEEN YOUR EXCUSE
FOR EVERYTHING.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.826
YEAH, NO, WHY YOU ARE
LATE COMING HOME,

12:05.826 --> 12:07.828
WHY YOU DON'T FEEL
LIKE TALKING,

12:07.828 --> 12:10.500
WHY YOU SHUT YOUR COMPUTER
EVERY TIME I WALK IN THE ROOM.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.033
IT'S... IT'S LIKE
I DON'T EVEN EXIST.
HEY, THAT'S UNFAIR.

12:13.033 --> 12:15.205
WHAT'S UNFAIR IS BEING
IN LOVE WITH SOMEONE

12:15.205 --> 12:17.908
WHO TREATS YOU LIKE A STRANGER.
THAT'S UNFAIR.

12:17.908 --> 12:20.440
YOU KNOW, AND I DON'T
WANT YOU TO APOLOGIZE.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.875
I DON'T.
I WANT YOU TO WANT TO BE HERE.

12:24.875 --> 12:26.276
TALK TO ME.

12:26.276 --> 12:30.981
JUST--JUST BE HONEST
ABOUT WHATEVER'S GOING ON.

12:33.053 --> 12:35.055
YOU WANT ME TO BE HONEST.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.057
YES.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.059
THE MORE YOU JUMP
DOWN MY THROAT,

12:39.059 --> 12:41.031
THE LESS
I WANT TO BE HERE.

12:41.031 --> 12:43.533
HOW'S THAT FOR HONESTY?

12:43.533 --> 12:45.365
DEMETRI!

12:45.365 --> 12:47.067
DEM!

12:47.067 --> 12:49.099
(door slams)

12:51.771 --> 12:53.773
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR HAVING ME.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.976
OH, NOT AT ALL.
WE ALWAYS NEED VOLUNTEERS.

12:55.976 --> 12:58.178
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
THERE'S A LOT OF MENIAL TASKS--

12:58.178 --> 13:02.412
A LOT OF CHARTS TO BE FILED
AND BLOOD TO BE RUN TO THE LAB.

13:02.412 --> 13:05.115
IT'S NOT EXACTLY GLAMOROUS.
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR GLAMOUR.

13:05.115 --> 13:08.518
(Bryce) DR. BENFORD?
HEY, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
AT THAT INTERN CONFERENCE?

13:08.518 --> 13:11.121
YEAH, BUT LAB'S LOST THE COAGS
ON OUR SPIDER GIRL,

13:11.121 --> 13:13.223
THE O.R. IS TRYING TO BUMP
OUR APPY ANOTHER HOUR,

13:13.223 --> 13:15.896
AND VOLVULUS GUY
IS LEAVING THE A.M.A.

13:15.896 --> 13:20.170
TO SEE HIS KID
IN THIS "ICE CAPADES" THING.
OKAY, SO REDRAW THE COAGS,
TELL THE O.R. NO,

13:20.170 --> 13:22.572
AND I'LL TALK TO SKATER DAD.
OKAY.

13:22.572 --> 13:24.574
BRYCE, DO YOU KNOW NICOLE?
UH, YEAH.

13:24.574 --> 13:27.207
YEAH, I THINK WE MET AT YOUR
CHRISTMAS PARTY LAST YEAR. HI.

13:27.207 --> 13:30.110
HEY.
NICOLE'S VOLUNTEERING HERE.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:30.110 --> 13:33.083
SHADOW BRYCE. HE'LL SHOW YOU
THE LAY OF THE LAND.
THANKS.

13:33.083 --> 13:35.085
I WILL CATCH YOU LATER.

13:35.085 --> 13:37.047
WHAT'S "VOLVULUS"?

13:37.047 --> 13:38.218
TWISTED GUT.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.220
YOU PRE-MED?

13:40.220 --> 13:45.125
NO, I-I'M JUST VOLUNTEERING,
HELPING PEOPLE, YOU KNOW.

13:45.125 --> 13:47.257
(speaking Japanese)
UH...

13:47.257 --> 13:49.329
UM, MA'AM...

13:49.329 --> 13:52.532
MA'AM, OKAY, SLOW DOWN. I'M
SORRY. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU.
(speaking Japanese)

13:52.532 --> 13:54.404
(speaking Japanese)

14:05.475 --> 14:06.977
THANK YOU.

14:06.977 --> 14:08.348
ARIGATO.

14:08.348 --> 14:11.281
SWEET PEAS SYMBOLIZE GOOD-BYE
IN JAPANESE CULTURE.

14:11.281 --> 14:15.155
IT'S CONSIDERED A BAD OMEN
TO GIVE IT TO THE SICK.
AH.

14:15.155 --> 14:17.327
MM.

14:17.327 --> 14:20.130
IS THAT A CARDIGAN?

14:20.130 --> 14:23.093
WHAT? I WAS GOING
FOR AVERAGE JOE.

14:23.093 --> 14:26.997
BACK OFF, DEM.
THAT JACKET? RIDICULOUS.

14:26.997 --> 14:29.639
SAYS THE FBI AGENT
IN A POLICE T-SHIRT.

14:29.639 --> 14:31.471
GOOD GOING.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.173
(dog barking in distance)

14:33.173 --> 14:34.404
WHAT?

14:34.404 --> 14:37.948
"GO DOWNTOWN,
CHECK THE TIME."

15:00.170 --> 15:04.004
WE'RE...
HERE FOR THE MEETING.

15:06.136 --> 15:10.140
AT, UH,
DR. RAYNAUD'S INVITATION.

15:34.564 --> 15:38.168
(exhales deeply)

15:58.558 --> 16:00.590
WHO'S GONNA PLAY?

16:04.094 --> 16:06.066
(scoffs) PLAY?

16:12.102 --> 16:16.176
(click)

16:16.176 --> 16:20.050
WHO IS GOING TO PLAY?

16:25.985 --> 16:28.358
(click)

16:30.520 --> 16:34.224
I GET IT. NO BULLETS.
GOOD GAG.

16:43.103 --> 16:48.007
YOUR TICKET...

16:48.007 --> 16:50.009
IN.

16:53.113 --> 16:57.187
WELCOME TO THE BLUE HAND,
GENTLEMEN.

17:04.224 --> 17:06.756
YOU GOT A DEATH WISH?
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.

17:06.756 --> 17:08.528
NOT TODAY.

17:23.042 --> 17:26.376
(indistinct conversations)

17:26.376 --> 17:29.219
THAT WAS A REAL BULLET IN
THAT GUN. YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

17:29.219 --> 17:32.152
LISTEN, DEMETRI,
UNLIKE THE REST OF THESE PEOPLE,

17:32.152 --> 17:34.624
I KNOW I'M GONNA BE ALIVE
IN SIX MONTHS. I'VE SEEN IT.

17:34.624 --> 17:38.088
SO BULLET OR NO BULLET, THERE'S
NO WAY I WAS GONNA DIE TONIGHT.

17:38.088 --> 17:40.790
HEY.
WHAT CAN I GET YOU?

17:40.790 --> 17:43.062
COULD YOU GET US
TO TALK TO RAYNAUD?

17:43.062 --> 17:45.064
IS HE HERE?

17:45.064 --> 17:47.137
HMM. YOU GUYS FIRST-TIMERS?

17:47.137 --> 17:49.569
NO. MAYBE.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.271
THE RAYNAUD CHANGES
AT EACH GATHERING.

17:51.271 --> 17:54.104
AND WHERE IS
TONIGHT'S RAYNAUD?

17:54.104 --> 17:56.606
HE'S AROUND. YOU'LL KNOW HIM
WHEN YOU SEE HIM.

18:01.511 --> 18:04.154
WHAT YOU GOT?

18:04.154 --> 18:07.117
IT WAS ON MY BOARD.

18:07.117 --> 18:08.458
ANOTHER PIECE
OF THE PUZZLE.

18:08.458 --> 18:12.091
SO WHAT DO WE... DO HERE?

18:12.091 --> 18:14.464
ANYTHING YOU WANT.

18:14.464 --> 18:17.797
NO LIMITS. NO FEAR.
THERE'S SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.869
(buzz saw revs, man screams)

18:19.869 --> 18:21.601
(man laughs)

18:23.673 --> 18:24.834
HI.

18:24.834 --> 18:28.138
HI.

18:28.138 --> 18:30.580
LOOK, I DISCUSS--

18:30.580 --> 18:33.683
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
REALLY BE DOING THE--

18:33.683 --> 18:35.515
ANY OF THE...
UH, ME FIRST?

18:35.515 --> 18:37.687
UM, OKAY.

18:37.687 --> 18:39.319
OKAY. FINE.

18:39.319 --> 18:42.422
UM, I REALLY JUST CAME BY
TO SAY THANK YOU

18:42.422 --> 18:45.124
FOR EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE
FOR DYLAN.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.857
HE DID ALL THE HARD WORK
HIMSELF.

18:47.857 --> 18:50.530
WELL, YOU SAVED HIS LIFE...
(mutters indistinctly)

18:50.530 --> 18:53.203
AND IN DOING THAT, UM,

18:53.203 --> 18:55.535
YOU SAVED MINE AS WELL.

18:55.535 --> 18:59.509
LOOK, THE VERY LAST THING
THAT I WOULD WANT TO DO

18:59.509 --> 19:02.842
IS RUIN YOURS.

19:02.842 --> 19:06.416
I REALLY MEAN IT. I REALLY
DON'T THINK WE SHOULD BE--
HEY, LISTEN, I UNDERSTAND.

19:06.416 --> 19:08.618
I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS
IS REALLY VERY AWKWARD.

19:08.618 --> 19:10.920
SO PLEASE JUST LET ME
BE PERFECTLY CLEAR.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.184
NOTHING IS GOING
TO HAPPEN BETWEEN US.

19:14.184 --> 19:17.187
NO, I KNOW THAT.
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING

19:17.187 --> 19:19.489
TO COME BETWEEN YOU
AND YOUR HUSBAND,

19:19.489 --> 19:22.161
DESPITE WHAT WE MAY HAVE
SEEN OR EXPERIENCED.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.763
GOOD.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.766
OKAY, GOOD. SO, UH,
DYLAN AND I ARE GONNA MOVE BACK

19:26.766 --> 19:30.240
TO THE BAY AREA AS SOON AS THEY
APPROVE THE HOSPITAL TRANSFER.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.903
GOOD. OH, GOOD.
THAT'S... THAT'S GOOD.

19:33.903 --> 19:37.877
YOU MUST BE ANXIOUS TO, UM,
YOU KNOW, GET BACK TO WORK.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.750
YEAH, RIGHT. UM--
AND I SHOULD GO. SO...

19:40.750 --> 19:43.913
LISTEN, UM, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR EVERYTHING AGAIN.

19:43.913 --> 19:47.357
YEAH, I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO PUSH THAT TRANSFER THROUGH.

19:47.357 --> 19:49.789
OKAY, GREAT. THANKS.
UM, JUST EXCUSE ME.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.361
THANK YOU.

19:53.493 --> 19:55.865
HEY, WHERE DID YOU LEARN
HOW TO SPEAK JAPANESE?

19:55.865 --> 19:57.867
MY DAD WAS STATIONED IN OKINAWA
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

19:57.867 --> 19:59.869
AND I PICKED IT UP.

19:59.869 --> 20:01.871
WHEN WE MOVED BACK,
I TOOK IT IN SCHOOL.

20:01.871 --> 20:05.535
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?
JUST FOR A SECOND.

20:05.535 --> 20:09.509
UH, IN MY FLASH-FORWARD,
I SAW THIS SYMBOL BEHIND HER.

20:09.509 --> 20:12.682
OH. WHO'S THE WOMAN?

20:12.682 --> 20:15.845
I HAVE NO IDEA. I WAS HOPING
THAT IF I COULD FIGURE OUT

20:15.845 --> 20:18.848
WHAT THE SYMBOL MEANT, THEN I
MIGHT BE ABLE TO FIND HER.

20:18.848 --> 20:20.820
I KNOW
IT'S AN ASIAN CHARACTER,

20:20.820 --> 20:23.923
BUT NOBODY SEEMS
TO RECOGNIZE IT.
THEY DIDN'T SEE IT
BECAUSE IT WASN'T FINISHED.

20:23.923 --> 20:26.426
YOU HAVE A PEN?

20:26.426 --> 20:28.428
YEAH, A PENCIL.
MAY I?

20:28.428 --> 20:30.229
PLEASE.

20:32.932 --> 20:36.766
THERE. IT'S KANJI.
IT'S A JAPANESE LETTER.

20:36.766 --> 20:39.008
KANJI.

20:39.008 --> 20:40.610
WHAT'S IT MEAN?

20:40.610 --> 20:42.372
"BELIEVE."

20:46.646 --> 20:48.848
MR. STARK?

20:48.848 --> 20:50.850
MIKE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:50.850 --> 20:52.852
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

20:52.852 --> 20:57.427
I JUST DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT LEAVING
THINGS THE WAY WE DID EARLIER.

20:57.427 --> 21:01.991
I'M NOT SURE I UNDERSTAND.

21:01.991 --> 21:04.864
IT'S JUST...
YOU SEEMED SO HAPPY,

21:04.864 --> 21:07.897
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO TELL YOU,

21:07.897 --> 21:11.841
BUT I THINK YOU DESERVE
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

21:11.841 --> 21:14.003
TRUTH ABOUT WHAT?

21:14.003 --> 21:16.005
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW

21:16.005 --> 21:18.808
IN YOUR VISION WITH TRACY.

21:18.808 --> 21:21.010
(whispers)
IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

21:23.613 --> 21:25.985
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

21:25.985 --> 21:29.889
(normal voice) I WAS WITH HER
IN THE HUMVEE.

21:37.327 --> 21:38.828
(tires screeching)

21:38.828 --> 21:41.871
(speaks indistinctly) THIS IS
HIT MAN 2 REQUESTING BACKUP.

21:41.871 --> 21:44.774
(speaks indistinctly)
PURSUING HAJIS HEADING NORTH,

21:44.774 --> 21:47.937
ABOUT 2 CLICKS AWAY
FROM CHECKPOINT VICTOR TANGO.

21:47.937 --> 21:49.939
OVER.

21:49.939 --> 21:51.341
(static)

21:51.341 --> 21:53.743
DAMN!
(tires screeching)

21:58.448 --> 22:02.852
WHO THE HELL ARE THESE GUYS?
THOSE AREN'T HAJIS.

22:02.852 --> 22:06.426
BACK UP! BACK UP! THOSE ARE
JERICHO! WE GOT TO GET OUT!

22:06.426 --> 22:08.558
BURRO, BURRO!
WE'RE GONNA GET WAXED!

22:08.558 --> 22:11.000
(Tracy) LOOK OUT!

22:11.000 --> 22:13.062
COME ON!

22:13.062 --> 22:15.365
TRACEY! TRACEY!

22:18.337 --> 22:21.040
I'M SORRY, SIR.

22:21.040 --> 22:25.445
WHEN I WENT BACK
TO CHECK ON HER...

22:25.445 --> 22:29.619
TRACEY! TRACEY!

22:38.888 --> 22:42.732
I HAD TO RUN.
I HAD TO. BUT I SAW HER DIE.

22:42.732 --> 22:46.736
(voice breaking)
I SAW HER DIE.

22:46.736 --> 22:48.638
(whoosh)

22:50.600 --> 22:53.843
(heavy metal music playing)

23:03.813 --> 23:06.616
(Mark) THIS IS PATHETIC.

23:06.616 --> 23:09.819
WHAT HAVE THEY GOT
TO LOSE, MAN?

23:09.819 --> 23:12.922
DOESN'T MATTER IF IT'S
TONIGHT OR NEXT MONTH.

23:12.922 --> 23:15.024
THEY'RE DEAD ANYWAY.

23:15.024 --> 23:17.997
(alarm sounding)

23:17.997 --> 23:20.930
â™ªâ™ª

23:27.737 --> 23:30.880
(alarm continues sounding)

23:30.880 --> 23:33.683
(door slams)

23:43.653 --> 23:46.826
BLUE HANDS.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.058
(lowered voice)
THE REPRESENT A PORTAL,

23:49.058 --> 23:52.031
A GATEWAY FROM ONE
UNDERSTANDING TO ANOTHER.

23:52.031 --> 23:55.134
THE BLUE HAND
MARKS A SURRENDER

23:55.134 --> 23:57.667
TO THE INEVITABLE.

23:57.667 --> 24:01.140
(whispers) RAYNAUD.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.442
(gun clicks)

24:06.215 --> 24:09.579
(Demetri) EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
GET DOWN!

24:09.579 --> 24:11.551
EVERYBODY DOWN!
EVERYBODY!

24:11.551 --> 24:14.053
(Mark) FBI!
GET DOWN! EVERYBODY DOWN!

24:14.053 --> 24:16.025
GET OFF ME!
(Demetri) NOW! NOW!

24:16.025 --> 24:18.888
AAH. I WANT TO--
TURN AROUND. TURN AROUND!

24:18.888 --> 24:21.060
(handcuffs clicking)
I WANT THIS TO END.

24:21.060 --> 24:24.063
NOT TODAY. NOT TODAY.

24:31.140 --> 24:34.143
"DR. MAURICE RAYNAUD--

24:34.143 --> 24:36.576
"DISCOVERED
RAYNAUD'S PHENOMENON,

24:36.576 --> 24:39.909
"ALSO KNOWN
AS 'BLUE HANDS.'

24:39.909 --> 24:41.911
DIED 1881."

24:41.911 --> 24:43.953
GUESS IT DOES BEAT
YOUR REAL NAME--

24:43.953 --> 24:45.985
JEFF SLINGERLAND.
AM I SAYING THAT RIGHT?

24:45.985 --> 24:48.057
SAYS HERE
YOU TAUGHT AMERICAN HISTORY

24:48.057 --> 24:51.060
AT SOUTH FAIRFAX HIGH.
TEACHER OF THE YEAR 'O8.

24:51.060 --> 24:53.222
THEN THE BLACKOUT HAPPENS,
AND YOU TURN

24:53.222 --> 24:55.965
INTO FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE.
WHY IS THAT, JEFF?

24:55.965 --> 24:58.828
OR DO YOU PREFER DR. RAYNAUD?

24:58.828 --> 25:00.900
YOU KNOW WHAT
NIETZSCHE SAID--

25:00.900 --> 25:03.833
IF YOU GAZE INTO THE ABYSS,
THE ABYSS ALSO GAZES INTO YOU.

25:03.833 --> 25:05.835
IS THAT THE KIND
OF OPTIMISM THAT COMES

25:05.835 --> 25:08.107
FROM NOT HAVING A VISION?

25:08.107 --> 25:10.109
I HAD A VISION--

25:10.109 --> 25:12.982
A BOTTOMLESS PIT
OF DARKNESS AND INDIFFERENCE,

25:12.982 --> 25:16.085
INFINITE IN ITS NOTHINGNESS,
AS IF I NEVER EXISTED AT ALL

25:16.085 --> 25:17.917
AND I NEVER WOULD AGAIN.

25:17.917 --> 25:21.090
THESE PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T HAVE
A VISION--THESE GHOSTS--

25:21.090 --> 25:23.823
WHERE DO YOU RAYNAUDS
FIND THEM?

25:23.823 --> 25:27.026
WE DON'T FIND THEM.
YOU DO.

25:28.728 --> 25:31.000
THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO GO
THAN YOUR MOSAIC SITE.

25:34.904 --> 25:36.906
COULDN'T DO IT WITHOUT YOU.

25:36.906 --> 25:39.208
(laughs)

25:45.144 --> 25:48.277
DO YOU SEE THIS GUY?

25:48.277 --> 25:51.080
ONE OF YOUR FELLOW
BLUE HANDS,

25:51.080 --> 25:54.023
SHOT AND NEARLY KILLED
AN FBI AGENT.

25:54.023 --> 25:56.085
YOU BETTER START TALKING,
OR I'M GONNA CHARGE YOU

25:56.085 --> 26:00.960
AS AN ACCOMPLICE AFTER THE FACT.
ALL RIGHT, FINE. THROW ME
IN PRISON. I DON'T CARE.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.332
IT'S ALL MAPPED OUT.
DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:03.332 --> 26:07.036
THE SCRIPT FOR THIS CONVERSATION
HAS ALREADY BEEN WRITTEN.

26:07.036 --> 26:10.069
WHATEVER YOU'VE ALL SEEN
IS GONNA HAPPEN.

26:10.069 --> 26:12.101
(Al) WHAT IF YOU'RE WRONG?

26:12.101 --> 26:14.744
WHAT IF APRIL 29th
COMES AND GOES,

26:14.744 --> 26:16.646
AND YOU'RE STILL ALIVE?

26:18.107 --> 26:19.979
WHAT THEN?

26:19.979 --> 26:22.181
YOU CAN RUN

26:22.181 --> 26:24.654
AND YOU CAN HIDE,

26:24.654 --> 26:26.916
BUT YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
WHAT'S COMING.

26:26.916 --> 26:29.588
NO ONE CAN.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.322
(phone rings in distance)

26:33.322 --> 26:34.864
HEADING OUT?

26:34.864 --> 26:37.867
YES,
BACK TO MY LUXURY SUITE.

26:37.867 --> 26:39.869
THEY STILL PUTTING
VISITING AGENTS UP

26:39.869 --> 26:44.033
AT THOSE CRAPPY HOTELS
BY THE AIRPORT?
NOW YOU'RE JUST RUBBING IT IN.

26:44.033 --> 26:46.976
YOU EVER TRY DIRTY RICE?

26:46.976 --> 26:50.039
DIRTY RICE? WHAT, YOU MEAN,
LIKE, EATING IT OFF THE FLOOR?

26:50.039 --> 26:52.381
(laughs)

26:52.381 --> 26:56.015
NO, NO, IT'S, UH, IT'S
A CAJUN DISH. IT'S MY FAVORITE.

26:56.015 --> 26:59.048
MY MOM MAKES IT FOR ME
WHEN I GO HOME AT THE HOLIDAYS.

26:59.048 --> 27:02.051
I THOUGHT I MIGHT TRY
AND MAKE A BATCH OF IT TONIGHT.

27:02.051 --> 27:06.095
IF YOU'RE FEELING HUNGRY
AT ALL...
THAT'S, UH, SWEET OF YOU.
THAT REALLY IS,

27:06.095 --> 27:08.958
BUT I'M JET-LAGGED.
I UNDERSTAND.
I'D BE TIRED, TOO.

27:08.958 --> 27:10.930
(sighs)

27:14.934 --> 27:18.237
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN
THINKING ABOUT OUR BIRD.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.640
WHAT IF YOU TAPED THE WINDOW?
HOW DO YOU MEAN?

27:21.640 --> 27:24.343
WELL, IF YOU COVER
THE WINDOW,

27:24.343 --> 27:26.846
THE BIRD MIGHT NOT
CRASH INTO IT.

27:26.846 --> 27:29.679
IT'S A NICE THOUGHT.

27:29.679 --> 27:31.781
I THINK IT'LL PROBABLY JUST
CRASH INTO A DIFFERENT WINDOW.

27:31.781 --> 27:34.924
MAYBE.

27:34.924 --> 27:37.126
BUT IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

27:37.126 --> 27:39.028
HMM.

27:45.735 --> 27:49.398
CAN'T ACCUSE HIM
OF SUGARCOATING THINGS.

27:49.398 --> 27:54.974
THAT GUY MAKES MARILYN MANSON
LOOK LIKE MR. ROGERS.

27:54.974 --> 27:59.078
EVERYBODY DEALS WITH IT
DIFFERENTLY, I GUESS.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.010
I'M SORRY, I...

28:01.010 --> 28:03.352
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
(flips pages)

28:03.352 --> 28:06.986
AT LEAST I DON'T HAVE TO DEAL
WITH THE UNCERTAINTY.

28:06.986 --> 28:08.988
IT IS THE ONE GOOD THING

28:08.988 --> 28:11.861
ABOUT KNOWING THE EXACT DATE
OF YOUR MURDER.

28:11.861 --> 28:15.094
GIVES YOU TIME TO PREPARE.

28:15.094 --> 28:16.395
SO WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

28:16.395 --> 28:19.368
MARCH 15th COMES AROUND,
YOU'RE JUST GONNA PACK IT IN?

28:19.368 --> 28:21.801
COME ON, MAN.
HUH?

28:21.801 --> 28:24.073
SAY YOUR GOOD-BYES,
HAVE A NICE FAREWELL DINNER?

28:24.073 --> 28:26.075
I'LL DEAL WITH IT THE WAY
I CHOOSE TO DEAL WITH IT.

28:26.075 --> 28:28.277
YOU DEAL WITH IT BY FIGHTING IT.
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE.

28:28.277 --> 28:31.841
WAKE UP, WOULD YOU, PLEASE?
WAKE UP!

28:31.841 --> 28:33.712
D. GIBBONS.
THE--THE DOLL FACTORY.

28:33.712 --> 28:36.445
137 SEKUNDEN. THE BLUE HAND.

28:36.445 --> 28:39.288
IT'S ALL COME TRUE.
NO, NO.

28:39.288 --> 28:41.951
LISTEN, IT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT YOU'RE--
MARK, LOOK AROUND YOU.

28:41.951 --> 28:44.994
LOOK AROUND, MAN.

28:47.957 --> 28:51.030
RAYNAUD WAS RIGHT.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.501
IT'S ALL HAPPENING,

28:52.501 --> 28:55.134
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

29:00.269 --> 29:02.211
THERE'S NO WAY OUT.

29:02.211 --> 29:04.914
THERE'S NOTHING YOU OR I
OR ANYONE CAN DO

29:04.914 --> 29:06.916
TO ESCAPE WHAT'S COMING.

29:10.219 --> 29:15.024
(cartoon playing indistinctly)

29:32.201 --> 29:35.104
OKAY, I'M TIRED, YOU'RE TIRED.
IT'S TIME FOR BED.

29:35.104 --> 29:37.776
OH, MOMMY! PLEASE?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.548
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I GOT IT.

29:39.548 --> 29:42.011
OKAY, FIVE MINUTES.

29:42.011 --> 29:43.953
OKAY.
FIVE.

29:43.953 --> 29:45.114
OKAY.

29:45.114 --> 29:46.956
(kiss) I LOVE YOU.

29:46.956 --> 29:48.958
I LOVE YOU, TOO.
SLEEP WELL. GOOD NIGHT.

29:48.958 --> 29:50.119
OKAY.

29:50.119 --> 29:53.122
(cartoon
continues indistinctly)

30:00.970 --> 30:05.074
DADDY, ARE YOU SAD?

30:05.074 --> 30:07.536
NO. NO, BABY.

30:07.536 --> 30:09.408
DADDY'S HAPPY.

30:09.408 --> 30:11.110
(kiss)

30:11.110 --> 30:14.113
â™ªâ™ª

30:30.099 --> 30:31.400
(whoosh)

30:35.464 --> 30:37.466
(whoosh)

30:52.051 --> 30:54.053
GOT YOU SOMETHING.

30:54.053 --> 30:57.887
UM... I'M NOT REALLY HUNGRY,
BUT THANKS.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.064
(sighs)

31:11.240 --> 31:14.103
I REALLY DO LOVE YOU.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

31:19.108 --> 31:21.981
I KNOW I'VE, UH...

31:21.981 --> 31:25.184
I'VE BEEN DISTANT LATELY,
BUT I...

31:25.184 --> 31:28.257
DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO TELL YOU, UH...

31:28.257 --> 31:30.259
AND WHAT TO TELL YOU.

31:30.259 --> 31:33.622
(stammers) I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO.

31:33.622 --> 31:37.096
ABOUT?

31:37.096 --> 31:39.068
ABOUT MY FLASH-FORWARD.

31:43.372 --> 31:47.206
I TOLD YOU I SAW MYSELF
ON THE BEACH AT OUR WEDDING.

31:47.206 --> 31:50.980
THAT WAS A LIE.

31:50.980 --> 31:53.282
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,

31:53.282 --> 31:55.284
ONLY DARKNESS.

31:55.284 --> 31:58.517
NOTHINGNESS.

31:58.517 --> 32:01.120
I DIDN'T HAVE
A FLASH-FORWARD

32:01.120 --> 32:04.123
BECAUSE I'M GONNA BE DEAD.

32:04.123 --> 32:08.097
TONIGHT, I MET ALL THESE PEOPLE
JUST LIKE ME.

32:08.097 --> 32:11.700
NO VISIONS. NO HOPE.

32:11.700 --> 32:15.364
THEY WERE JUST...
WAITING TO DIE.

32:19.568 --> 32:22.071
I DON'T WANNA BE LIKE THAT.

32:22.071 --> 32:27.116
I DON'T WANNA BE LIKE THAT.
I WANNA BE HERE WITH YOU.

32:27.116 --> 32:29.078
DEM?
YES?

32:29.078 --> 32:30.449
I KNOW WHAT I SAW...

32:30.449 --> 32:32.581
(whoosh)

32:32.581 --> 32:36.025
THE BEACH. OUR WEDDING.
I KNOW YOU WERE THERE.

32:36.025 --> 32:38.027
(whoosh)

32:38.027 --> 32:41.960
(whispers) YOU GOTTA KNOW
HOW MUCH I WANTED THAT.

32:41.960 --> 32:44.133
(normal voice)
I WANTED TO MARRY YOU,

32:44.133 --> 32:46.135
HAVE A BABY WITH YOU,

32:46.135 --> 32:48.137
GROW OLD WITH YOU.
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

32:48.137 --> 32:51.100
YOU JUST MADE A MISTAKE.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.243
THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING
FOR SURE, SO--
ZOEY, I'M SURE.

32:54.243 --> 32:56.705
I'M SURE. LISTEN TO ME.

32:56.705 --> 32:58.707
I LOVE YOU.

32:58.707 --> 33:01.280
I LOVE YOU.
YOU ARE THE LIFE THAT I WANTED.

33:01.280 --> 33:04.613
THEN LET'S HAVE THAT LIFE.

33:04.613 --> 33:06.615
WE CAN HAVE THAT LIFE.

33:06.615 --> 33:10.189
YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T WANT
TO GIVE UP HOPE. THEN DON'T.

33:10.189 --> 33:12.361
WE HAVE
TWO CONFLICTING VISIONS.

33:12.361 --> 33:15.324
WE CAN CHOOSE WHICH ONE
WE WANNA BELIEVE IN.

33:15.324 --> 33:18.097
RIGHT?

33:18.097 --> 33:22.371
I CHOOSE HOPE.

33:22.371 --> 33:24.033
(whispers) YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.579
(sniffles)

33:30.579 --> 33:34.012
(sighs)

33:44.753 --> 33:47.326
THANKS FOR COMING OUT, MIKE.
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT, SIR?

33:47.326 --> 33:48.757
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

33:50.159 --> 33:51.500
(locker creaks)

33:51.500 --> 33:54.103
THAT'S WHY
I CALLED YOU OUT, ACTUALLY.

33:54.103 --> 33:56.335
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
BE UPSET WITH ME, SIR,

33:56.335 --> 33:59.068
FOR... TELLING YOU
WHAT I TOLD YOU.

34:02.511 --> 34:06.075
I'VE SPENT
THE LAST FEW WEEKS

34:06.075 --> 34:08.077
TORTURED BY WHAT I SAW,

34:08.077 --> 34:11.280
UP AND DOWN,
LIVING IN LIMBO.

34:11.280 --> 34:15.084
BUT YOUR STORY,
WHAT YOU TOLD ME...

34:15.084 --> 34:17.086
YOU'VE FINALLY GIVEN ME
SOME PEACE.

34:17.086 --> 34:22.060
AND I WAS HOPING MAYBE
I COULD RETURN THE FAVOR.

34:25.694 --> 34:27.696
(whispers) WOW.

34:30.139 --> 34:32.601
YOU WON'T BE
THE FIRST SCREWED UP VET

34:32.601 --> 34:34.203
THIS PLACE HAS HIRED.

34:34.203 --> 34:36.175
AARON, THANK YOU.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.547
NO, THANK YOU.

34:42.181 --> 34:45.614
YOU'RE A REAL ARTIST.
YOU COULD TOTALLY SELL THESE.

34:45.614 --> 34:48.117
THANKS.

34:48.117 --> 34:50.119
YEAH, I'D GIVE 'EM AWAY
FOR NOTHING

34:50.119 --> 34:52.221
IF SOMEBODY COULD
HELP ME FIND HER.

34:52.221 --> 34:54.823
THANKS. SO YOU DON'T REMEMBER
HER NAME OR WHERE SHE LIVES?

34:54.823 --> 34:57.826
UH, JUST, I REMEMBER
THE IMAGES...
(whoosh)

34:57.826 --> 35:00.098
BUT I-I JUST CAN'T
PUT THEM TOGETHER.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.801
BUT YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOU FELT ABOUT HER?
(whoosh)

35:02.801 --> 35:05.103
OH, YEAH.

35:05.103 --> 35:08.277
YOU HAVE TO FIND HER, BRYCE.
HOW? SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

35:08.277 --> 35:10.309
WELL, LOOK AT YOUR PAINTINGS.
LOOK AT HER.

35:10.309 --> 35:14.513
IT'S JAPAN. IT HAS TO BE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN JAPAN?

35:14.513 --> 35:17.886
YOU COULD PUT YOUR STORY
UP ON MOSAIC.

35:17.886 --> 35:21.119
EVEN IF SHE DOESN'T SEE IT,
SOMEONE SHE KNOWS MIGHT.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.421
IT'S WORTH A SHOT.

35:53.282 --> 35:54.853
MORNING, GUYS.
(Demetri) HEY.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.426
MORNING.
YOU COMING TO THE MEETING?
YOU TWO GO AHEAD. HEY, DEMETRI?

35:57.426 --> 35:59.428
YEAH.
I LEFT SOMETHING ON YOUR DESK.

35:59.428 --> 36:01.930
CAN YOU MAKE SURE IT GETS
INTO THE RIGHT HANDS?

36:01.930 --> 36:03.932
YEAH. SEE YOU LATER.

36:11.370 --> 36:15.674
WE'VE GOT THIS RAYNAUD GUY
IN CUSTODY. NOW WHAT?

36:15.674 --> 36:17.676
HE'S STILL REFUSING
TO NAME NAMES,

36:17.676 --> 36:19.878
GIVE US AN IDEA
OF WHO'S IN CHARGE.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.751
MY SENSE IS
THIS PEOPLE AREN'T KILLERS--

36:22.751 --> 36:24.913
JUST LOST,
AGGRESSIVE NIHILISTS.

36:24.913 --> 36:27.256
YOUR SENSE? YOU'VE GOTTA
DO BETTER THAN THAT, MARK.

36:27.256 --> 36:29.258
YOU CAN BREAK ANY PERP.

36:29.258 --> 36:32.921
YOU'VE JUST GOTTA CHANGE
YOUR APPROACH.
NO, RAYNAUD'S DIFFERENT.

36:32.921 --> 36:35.794
CAN'T THREATEN HIM
WITH ANYTHING.

36:35.794 --> 36:38.327
HE'S GOT NOTHING TO LOSE.

36:38.327 --> 36:42.200
HE HAS SEEN HIS FUTURE,
AND IT IS BLEAK.

36:42.200 --> 36:45.203
HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
HOW IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.577
IT COULD BE A FALL, A FIGHT,
A SHOOTING, A CAR ACCIDENT.

36:48.577 --> 36:50.479
THE POSSIBILITIES ARE INFINITE.

36:52.581 --> 36:54.583
(Mark) THE GUY'S
WALKING ON EGGSHELLS

36:54.583 --> 36:58.216
EVERY MINUTE OF THE DAY, JUST
WAITING FOR THE HAMMER TO DROP.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.688
(whoosh)
HELLO?

36:59.688 --> 37:03.221
(man) Al, I, um, I just got off
the phone with the hospital.

37:03.221 --> 37:06.495
They took her off life support
an hour ago.

37:06.495 --> 37:08.497
I'm sorry, Al. She's gone.

37:08.497 --> 37:10.829
(whoosh)
(elevator bell dings)

37:10.829 --> 37:12.501
(Mark) EVERY DAY,

37:12.501 --> 37:14.933
HE WAKES UP WONDERING
IF TODAY IS THE DAY--

37:14.933 --> 37:17.906
IF TODAY IS THE DAY HIS FUTURE'S
FINALLY GONNA CATCH UP WITH HIM.

37:17.906 --> 37:20.839
(whoosh)
(voice breaks) WHAT'S GONNA
HAPPEN TO HER CHILDREN?

37:20.839 --> 37:22.841
It looks like the kids

37:22.841 --> 37:24.973
will have to be placed
in foster care.

37:24.973 --> 37:28.947
THOSE TWO BOYS ARE ORPHANS...

37:28.947 --> 37:30.319
BECAUSE OF ME?
(whoosh)

37:30.319 --> 37:32.921
No, Celia's death
was an accident, okay?

37:32.921 --> 37:35.424
It could've happened
to anyone.
BUT IT DIDN'T.

37:35.424 --> 37:37.526
IT WAS MY FAULT.

37:40.759 --> 37:43.762
I KILLED HER.

37:43.762 --> 37:45.334
STOP.

37:45.334 --> 37:46.895
STOP. STOP!

38:11.390 --> 38:12.391
AL!

38:12.391 --> 38:14.393
AL!
AL!

38:14.393 --> 38:15.994
AL!
TALK TO US, AL.

38:15.994 --> 38:18.497
(Mark) JUST--JUST TALK TO US.
WE CAN FIX THIS.

38:18.497 --> 38:21.029
HEY, MAN, WE CAN FIND HER.
WE CAN FIND CELIA.

38:21.029 --> 38:25.334
WE CAN PROTECT HER.
ANYTHING YOU NEED, WE CAN FIND
A WAY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN, SON.

38:25.334 --> 38:28.737
(Mark) COME ON, AL.
IT CAN HAPPEN ANYTIME,
ANYWHERE.

38:28.737 --> 38:31.780
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW IT HAPPENS.

38:31.780 --> 38:33.882
AL, LISTEN TO ME. YOU'RE ALIVE
SIX MONTHS FROM NOW.

38:33.882 --> 38:37.015
YOU SAW IT. YOU SAW IT!
MAN, YOU SAW IT!

38:37.015 --> 38:39.988
BUT IF I'M NOT HERE...
(Mark) COME ON, AL, GET DOWN.

38:39.988 --> 38:42.751
IF I'M NOT HERE...
(whoosh)

38:42.751 --> 38:45.023
IT MEANS WE CAN CHANGE THINGS.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.025
AL, PLEASE GET DOWN.

38:47.025 --> 38:50.599
WHAT I SAW...
I KILLED HER.

38:50.599 --> 38:53.001
WHAT YOU SAW...

38:53.001 --> 38:56.004
DOESN'T HAVE TO PLAY OUT
THAT WAY.

38:56.004 --> 38:59.368
AL, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:59.368 --> 39:02.941
I FOUND A WAY
TO CHANGE THE GAME.

39:02.941 --> 39:06.915
(whoosh)
Al, listen to me. Celia's death
was an accident, okay?

39:06.915 --> 39:10.118
A terrible, random accident.

39:10.118 --> 39:12.521
There's nothing you could've
done to avoid this.

39:12.521 --> 39:14.683
Nothing.
(crash)

39:14.683 --> 39:16.685
(Demetri) AL!
(Mark) AL!

(Demetri) "DEAR CELIA,

40:25.824 --> 40:27.826
"I DON'T KNOW YOUR LAST NAME,

40:27.826 --> 40:30.128
"AND I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU LIVE,

40:30.128 --> 40:33.001
"BUT I KNOW YOU HAVE
TWO YOUNG BOYS--

40:33.001 --> 40:36.805
"TWINS, I BELIEVE.

40:36.805 --> 40:40.909
"AND I KNOW YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A FLASH-FORWARD.

40:40.909 --> 40:44.212
"I UNDERSTAND
HOW TERRIFYING THAT IS

40:44.212 --> 40:47.075
AND HOW POWERLESS
YOU MUST BE FEELING."

40:48.947 --> 40:51.580
"BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW

40:51.580 --> 40:54.723
"THAT YOU ARE NOT ALONE

40:54.723 --> 40:56.725
"AND THAT YOUR SITUATION

40:56.725 --> 40:59.728
IS NOT AS HOPELESS
AS YOU THINK."

41:02.060 --> 41:06.164
"OUR PATHS WERE MEANT TO CROSS,

41:06.164 --> 41:08.937
"BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HOW.

41:08.937 --> 41:10.899
I DIDN'T KNOW WHEN."

41:12.841 --> 41:16.174
"BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED NOW.

41:16.174 --> 41:20.008
THINGS ARE NO LONGER GOING TO
UNFOLD AS I HAD FEARED."

41:22.250 --> 41:24.883
"MY GIFT TO YOU

41:24.883 --> 41:27.015
IS RELEASE FROM THAT DREAD..."

41:27.015 --> 41:30.719
â™ªâ™ª

41:30.719 --> 41:34.022
"FROM THE FEELING THAT
YOU'RE NO LONGER IN CONTROL."

41:46.735 --> 41:49.908
"WE WILL NEVER MEET.

41:49.908 --> 41:52.510
"I WILL NEVER KNOW YOU.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.544
"SO LIVE YOUR LIFE.

41:55.544 --> 41:57.515
LIVE EVERY DAY."

41:59.517 --> 42:03.592
"AND KNOW THAT THE FUTURE
IS UNWRITTEN."

42:06.655 --> 42:09.898
"MAKE THE MOST OF THAT."
