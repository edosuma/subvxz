01:00.934 --> 01:02.734
Louie, this is Rieger in 264.

01:02.767 --> 01:06.534
Just dropped off a fare from
the airport at 79th and Park.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.834
LOUIE:
Got it.

01:07.868 --> 01:11.400
By the way, Rieger,
better be on the lookout.

01:11.434 --> 01:12.767
It's a full moon.

01:12.801 --> 01:14.801
You know what that means.

01:14.834 --> 01:18.400
Every creep in this city
will be out tonight.

01:18.434 --> 01:22.968
Well, be sure to wear a jacket,
Louie, it's getting chilly.

01:23.000 --> 01:27.167
You think you're a real
Jan Murray, don't you, Rieger?

01:27.200 --> 01:28.300
WOMAN:
Taxi!

01:28.334 --> 01:29.667
Louie, I got a fare.

01:29.701 --> 01:30.834
Get back to you.

01:33.801 --> 01:35.300
Taxi!

01:43.501 --> 01:46.968
Shea stadium, please.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.767
There's no game tonight.

01:51.934 --> 01:55.534
I didn't ask for
the schedule, thank you.

02:01.501 --> 02:03.934
WOMAN:
Oh, that's Shea stadium, huh?

02:03.968 --> 02:05.167
ALEX:
That's it.

02:05.200 --> 02:08.267
You call that a ballpark?

02:08.300 --> 02:09.667
Well, it looks better
with the lights on.

02:12.167 --> 02:15.901
Old Ebbets field looked good
even in the dark.

02:15.934 --> 02:18.434
Lady, I didn't build
the place, I just...

02:18.467 --> 02:19.534
Well, never mind, never mind.

02:19.567 --> 02:21.667
Just take me
to La Guardia airport.

02:21.701 --> 02:24.968
I know a place
at the end of one the runways

02:25.000 --> 02:28.067
where the big ones
come down so close

02:28.100 --> 02:31.100
the lights shine
right in the window

02:31.133 --> 02:34.133
and you can hear them
lower their landing gear,

02:34.167 --> 02:36.501
they come down so close.

02:41.534 --> 02:43.534
Hey, full moon...

02:49.300 --> 02:51.033
( <i>engine roars</i> )

02:55.334 --> 02:57.667
That's the closest one
yet, Alex.

02:57.701 --> 03:00.934
Yeah, I think he left
some rubber on the roof.

03:00.968 --> 03:02.767
I like you.

03:02.801 --> 03:05.167
Most cab drivers want to talk.

03:05.200 --> 03:08.801
They do nothing
but ask me questions all night.

03:08.834 --> 03:10.133
I know what you mean.

03:10.167 --> 03:11.501
Do you do this often?

03:11.534 --> 03:13.868
Oop! That was
a question, I'm sorry.

03:13.901 --> 03:15.067
Aw, that's okay.

03:15.100 --> 03:17.000
I do it every once
in a while.

03:17.033 --> 03:18.400
I love New York City.

03:18.434 --> 03:20.200
I've lived here
all my life.

03:20.234 --> 03:23.467
I was at Woolworth's
35 years.

03:23.501 --> 03:26.367
You should have used
the express line.

03:26.400 --> 03:27.400
( <i>laughing</i> )

03:27.434 --> 03:28.868
Got you
that time, huh?

03:28.901 --> 03:31.167
I was a clerk
on the candy counter.

03:31.200 --> 03:32.634
Oh.

03:32.667 --> 03:36.300
Say, why don't we drive past
the store I used to work at,

03:36.334 --> 03:38.434
then you can take a look at it?

03:38.467 --> 03:39.434
Is it on our way?

03:39.467 --> 03:41.234
Everything is on our way.

03:41.267 --> 03:43.400
Let's go.

03:47.100 --> 03:49.067
( <i>horns honking</i> )

03:55.801 --> 03:59.400
Well, here's
where I call home.

03:59.434 --> 04:02.367
I had a very nice time.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.601
You know something?
So did I.

04:04.634 --> 04:05.734
Yeah.

04:05.767 --> 04:07.901
Well, why don't
you pick me up here

04:07.934 --> 04:10.067
tomorrow night,
say about 6:00-ish?

04:10.100 --> 04:13.934
Oh, I'm sorry, Dee, I check into
the garage around 5:00, 5:30,

04:13.968 --> 04:16.434
and I never know how
long I have to wait
for the day driver

04:16.466 --> 04:18.500
to bring in a cab
I can use.

04:18.534 --> 04:19.868
Oh, that's too bad.

04:19.901 --> 04:23.167
Well, maybe I'll see
you again sometime.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.434
For sure.

04:24.467 --> 04:27.200
How much do I owe you
for the trip tonight?

04:27.234 --> 04:29.534
Well, I warned you
it was going to be high.

04:29.567 --> 04:31.200
Uh... $74.25.

04:31.234 --> 04:33.534
Here. Would you
stop worrying?

04:33.567 --> 04:35.734
Believe me,
I'm comfortable.

04:35.767 --> 04:39.434
In fact, I'm filthy comfortable.

04:39.467 --> 04:41.601
On a Woolworth's pension?

04:41.634 --> 04:43.400
( <i>chuckles</i> )

04:43.434 --> 04:45.901
No, you see, Alex,
when I was young,

04:45.934 --> 04:48.834
girls my age were supposed
to get married,

04:48.868 --> 04:51.901
but something told me not to,
so I didn't,

04:51.934 --> 04:54.400
and then I went to work instead.

04:54.434 --> 04:56.234
Just a few months

04:56.267 --> 05:01.467
before I was retiring,
I met this very wealthy man.

05:01.501 --> 05:06.467
He asked me to marry him, and,
uh, something told me to accept.

05:06.501 --> 05:10.167
Four months after
the wedding, he died

05:10.200 --> 05:12.667
and he left me
everything.

05:12.701 --> 05:16.100
There's a moral
in there somewhere.

05:18.467 --> 05:20.734
Well, thank you, ma'am,
it was very nice.

05:20.767 --> 05:22.701
Yes. Now, I'd
like to give you

05:22.734 --> 05:24.267
a really
good tip, Alex.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.467
What's the best tip
you ever got?

05:26.501 --> 05:29.267
Well, a guy gave me $25 once.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.501
Yeah.

05:30.534 --> 05:31.767
Well...

05:31.801 --> 05:35.434
here's $26.

05:35.467 --> 05:40.367
Congratulations, Alex,
you set a new record.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.601
Well, thank you. I couldn't have
done it without you.

05:42.634 --> 05:44.200
Yeah.

05:44.234 --> 05:45.834
Hey, let me
help you out.

05:45.868 --> 05:48.234
Forget it.

06:12.133 --> 06:13.133
TONY:
Hey, Lou--

06:13.167 --> 06:14.167
Hey, Lou, how about

06:14.200 --> 06:16.167
putting me in one of
them clean cabs?

06:16.200 --> 06:18.467
Man, you're always
sticking me in pigpens.

06:18.501 --> 06:20.234
Oh, yeah,
I know what you mean.

06:20.267 --> 06:22.167
You want me
to explain it to you?

06:22.200 --> 06:23.467
Yeah.
You got a minute?

06:23.501 --> 06:24.868
Yeah, yeah, sure.

06:24.901 --> 06:27.000
Come here.
You see, it's like this:

06:27.033 --> 06:28.934
I don't give a rat's corpse

06:28.968 --> 06:31.467
whether you get
a clean cab or not.

06:32.801 --> 06:33.801
Oh... okay.

06:33.834 --> 06:36.501
Thanks for
explaining it to me.

06:39.033 --> 06:40.834
I enjoyed it.

06:42.601 --> 06:44.300
It never fails,
you know?

06:44.334 --> 06:45.434
Every full moon

06:45.467 --> 06:47.801
I get people too crazy
for Bellevue.

06:47.834 --> 06:49.767
My very first fare
last night

06:49.801 --> 06:52.501
was a guy who introduces
himself as God.

06:52.534 --> 06:55.033
Well, I had
an interesting night myself.

06:55.067 --> 06:58.234
Yeah, I picked up, uh,
three drunks and a flasher

06:58.267 --> 06:59.567
two transvestites...

06:59.601 --> 07:01.667
Oh, yeah, and one guy
who thought

07:01.701 --> 07:04.434
I was the most beautiful
woman in the world.

07:04.467 --> 07:08.534
Just crazies like that shouldn't
be allowed out on the streets.

07:08.567 --> 07:09.400
Hey!

07:09.434 --> 07:10.534
TONY:
Yo, Alex!

07:10.567 --> 07:12.000
ALEX:
Yo, ho, ho.

07:12.033 --> 07:16.033
Hey, Alex, did you get any
full moon crazies last night?

07:16.067 --> 07:17.133
No, I lucked out.

07:17.167 --> 07:18.667
I got this very
charming old lady

07:18.701 --> 07:20.634
who just wanted to
drive around and talk.

07:20.667 --> 07:21.634
Oh, yeah?

07:21.667 --> 07:24.300
You drove around
all night and talked?

07:24.334 --> 07:25.834
She tipped me 26 bucks.

07:25.868 --> 07:27.734
For 26 bucks
I'd drive around

07:27.767 --> 07:29.868
and sing "You
Light Up My Life."

07:29.901 --> 07:31.200
I know.

07:32.267 --> 07:33.400
I'm eating.

07:33.434 --> 07:34.567
( <i>giggles</i> )

07:37.167 --> 07:38.734
So you are.

07:38.767 --> 07:41.734
No... I mean, I'm <i>eating.</i>

07:41.767 --> 07:44.133
ELAINE:
What are you
talking about?

07:44.167 --> 07:46.868
Well, last night I picked up
a couple of rock musicians,

07:46.901 --> 07:49.534
and I think I'm still
on my contact high.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.734
I've had guys smoke
powerful stuff

07:51.767 --> 07:54.834
in the back seat before,
but nothing like this.

07:54.868 --> 07:56.467
Come on, you still
can't be high.

07:56.501 --> 08:00.200
Oh, I hope I am, because
the only thing I can think about

08:00.234 --> 08:03.334
is the fact that my hair
is growing all the time.

08:03.367 --> 08:04.834
( <i>laughter</i> )

08:04.868 --> 08:06.767
I'd kill for a Twinkie.

08:06.801 --> 08:08.300
Oh, Alex,
there you are.

08:08.334 --> 08:10.467
Hey, Dee, what
are you doing here?

08:10.501 --> 08:12.467
Oh, these must be
your friends.

08:12.501 --> 08:14.167
Don't tell me
who they are.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.234
I want to guess.

08:15.267 --> 08:16.968
Uh, oh, you must
be Elaine.

08:17.000 --> 08:17.968
Yeah!

08:18.000 --> 08:19.701
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

08:19.734 --> 08:22.534
I really admire
you working two jobs,

08:22.567 --> 08:23.901
raising children.

08:23.934 --> 08:25.367
That must be hard.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.234
Yeah, it gets tough
sometimes, you know?

08:27.267 --> 08:29.200
But I got to
a point in my life

08:29.234 --> 08:31.367
where I decided I
either had to do
this for myself

08:31.400 --> 08:35.133
or... Alex, who am I
spilling my guts out to?

08:35.167 --> 08:36.634
I'm sorry,
this is Dee Wilcox,

08:36.667 --> 08:38.534
the lady I drove
around last night.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.467
Your names came up
in the conversation.

08:41.501 --> 08:43.167
I feel I know you all.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.901
I feel I like you all.

08:44.934 --> 08:47.133
Whoever brought her in,
get her out.

08:48.634 --> 08:50.667
I bet you're Louie.

08:50.701 --> 08:53.167
Am I right?

08:53.200 --> 08:56.133
Sell it someplace
else, sister.

08:58.767 --> 09:00.534
I <i>am</i> right.

09:02.501 --> 09:08.067
Alex, I got the perfect
solution to our problem.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.167
What problem?

09:09.200 --> 09:10.767
Whenever I want
to ride with you

09:10.801 --> 09:11.934
I'll catch a cab here.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.133
No, Dee, this is crazy.

09:13.167 --> 09:15.267
You know, sometimes I have
to wait an hour

09:15.300 --> 09:16.667
before Louie
gives me a cab.

09:16.701 --> 09:17.834
Oh!

09:17.868 --> 09:19.934
Banta! Come over here.

09:19.968 --> 09:21.934
142-- immaculate.

09:21.968 --> 09:26.234
Don't say I never
done nothing for you.

09:26.267 --> 09:28.434
Uh, Mr. De Palma,

09:28.467 --> 09:33.133
if I tipped you $5,
would you consider, uh...

09:33.167 --> 09:35.667
Hey, Tony, get out of there!

09:35.701 --> 09:37.234
Get... get out, come on.

09:37.267 --> 09:38.334
Rieger!

09:38.367 --> 09:39.033
What?

09:39.067 --> 09:41.367
You got 142, come on.

09:41.400 --> 09:43.400
Come on, get in,
get in.

09:43.434 --> 09:45.267
Taxi!

09:50.234 --> 09:52.734
Old age is a funny thing.

09:52.767 --> 09:56.300
I woke up this morning,
found myself wanting blue hair.

09:56.334 --> 09:58.634
Well, don't rush
into anything, Dee.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.634
All right,
I'll think about it.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.701
Did I tell you
how I met George?

10:02.734 --> 10:03.868
Your husband?

10:03.901 --> 10:06.200
No, I don't think
you mentioned that.

10:06.234 --> 10:07.300
He came up to me

10:07.334 --> 10:09.400
at the counter
where I was working,

10:09.434 --> 10:11.601
and he said,
"I want a box of candy

10:11.634 --> 10:14.634
"for the most beautiful girl
that I've ever seen.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.300
What would you recommend?"

10:16.334 --> 10:18.267
I gave him

10:18.300 --> 10:23.067
some milk chocolate-covered
maraschino cherries

10:23.100 --> 10:26.234
wrapped in a heart-shaped box.

10:26.267 --> 10:29.501
He bought it
and he handed it to me.

10:29.534 --> 10:31.868
Pretty slick, huh?

10:33.367 --> 10:35.167
That's terrific,
you know?

10:35.200 --> 10:36.567
Yeah.

10:36.601 --> 10:39.000
It's too bad you
two didn't have
enough time together.

10:39.033 --> 10:41.100
Yeah.

10:41.133 --> 10:42.901
Well...

10:42.934 --> 10:45.934
I miss George's crapola.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.367
You know,
it must be very strange

10:50.400 --> 10:52.734
after a lifetime
on a limited budget

10:52.767 --> 10:54.534
to be rich all of a sudden.

10:54.567 --> 10:57.300
Oh, I felt
very uncomfortable at first.

10:57.334 --> 11:01.167
I was trying to live the
same old way I'd always lived,

11:01.200 --> 11:03.667
be the same old Dee
I'd always been.

11:03.701 --> 11:07.334
And then one day I went shopping
in Bloomingdale's.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.701
I had a terrible time
deciding what hat to buy.

11:10.734 --> 11:14.701
Suddenly I said to myself,
"What the hell, buy them all!"

11:14.734 --> 11:18.200
And that was
the day I decided

11:18.234 --> 11:24.100
being poor was best left
to people with no money.

11:31.567 --> 11:33.200
( <i>horns honking</i> )

11:33.234 --> 11:35.200
Another wonderful evening.

11:35.234 --> 11:36.300
Yeah.

11:36.334 --> 11:38.434
Here's your fare.

11:42.834 --> 11:45.467
What did I give you
for a tip last night?

11:45.501 --> 11:47.133
Let's break a new record.

11:47.167 --> 11:49.934
Oh, come on, please,
let's not break a new record.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.100
Oh, now, Dee

11:54.133 --> 11:56.868
I am not going
to take $100 from you.

11:56.901 --> 11:58.601
Now, look right at me.

11:58.634 --> 12:00.767
I'm not taking
$100 from you.

12:00.801 --> 12:02.801
Oh, please don't say no.

12:02.834 --> 12:05.067
Makes me feel patronized.

12:09.234 --> 12:10.234
Okay.

12:10.267 --> 12:11.934
You win, I lose.

12:11.968 --> 12:14.734
So why don't I feel worse?

12:16.701 --> 12:20.467
Well, maybe money doesn't
mean that much to me.

12:20.501 --> 12:22.267
What's important to me

12:22.300 --> 12:24.834
is what I can buy
with my money:

12:24.868 --> 12:27.834
Nice food, nice clothes,
nice people.

12:27.868 --> 12:30.634
See you tomorrow, huh?

12:43.100 --> 12:44.300
Hey, Alex!

12:44.334 --> 12:48.167
You picking up the old
lady again tonight?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.334
Yes, if you mean Dee, I am.

12:50.367 --> 12:54.067
Listen, this Dee doesn't
have a sister, does she?

12:54.100 --> 12:55.334
Would you believe it?

12:55.367 --> 12:57.200
These guys have been picking up
old ladies

12:57.234 --> 12:59.434
all over the city looking
for a setup like yours.

12:59.467 --> 13:01.667
It's not a setup, John.

13:01.701 --> 13:03.400
She's just a customer.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.734
Customer-- she's
the mother lode.

13:07.434 --> 13:08.901
You know, Alex, when I
first got this job,

13:08.934 --> 13:11.133
everyone told me
that the best fares

13:11.167 --> 13:12.601
were in the upper 80s.

13:12.634 --> 13:15.234
I thought they were
talking about streets.

13:16.868 --> 13:19.133
LOUIE:
Rieger!

13:19.167 --> 13:21.167
An anonymous donor
just called

13:21.200 --> 13:24.133
and said she wants
to reupholster your cab.

13:24.167 --> 13:26.334
I wonder who it
could have been.

13:26.367 --> 13:29.701
( <i>laughing</i> )

13:29.734 --> 13:33.234
Did Mommy Warbucks
raise your allowance?

13:35.067 --> 13:39.601
That broad is older
than the continental shelf!

13:39.634 --> 13:44.734
Her age would make
a good bowling score!

13:44.767 --> 13:46.701
"Oh, Alex, be a dear

13:46.734 --> 13:50.467
and take the kitty out
for a wee-wee."

13:52.267 --> 13:55.801
( <i>hysterical laughter</i>
 <i>breaks into coughing</i> )

13:55.834 --> 14:00.100
Hey, Louie, Louie,
take a quick gulp of this.

14:00.133 --> 14:01.334
Thank you.

14:03.901 --> 14:05.667
That's hot coffee!

14:05.701 --> 14:07.267
( <i>laughing</i> )

14:12.067 --> 14:15.334
DEE:
I have a little surprise
for you.

14:15.367 --> 14:17.200
Oh, what's that?

14:17.234 --> 14:18.767
It's a gift.

14:18.801 --> 14:20.968
Oh, that's really
nice of you, Dee,

14:21.000 --> 14:23.667
but I really can't
accept gifts from you.

14:23.701 --> 14:26.033
I mean, it's...
it's just not right.

14:26.067 --> 14:28.167
Would you accept it if it was

14:28.200 --> 14:29.501
for your birthday?

14:29.534 --> 14:32.367
Well, yeah, I guess,
if it <i>was</i> my birthday.

14:32.400 --> 14:36.634
Well, Happy Birthday,
early or late,

14:36.667 --> 14:38.868
however you want
to call it.

14:38.901 --> 14:42.267
Oh, Dee!

14:42.300 --> 14:45.033
That's really
a very nice sport coat.

14:45.067 --> 14:47.601
It's cashmere.

14:48.834 --> 14:51.033
Look, Dee, I'm
really feeling weird

14:51.067 --> 14:53.901
about driving you around
at night, you know?

14:53.934 --> 14:56.701
I mean, it's strange,
you know what I mean?

14:56.734 --> 14:59.033
Yeah, you're right,
it <i>is</i> strange.

14:59.067 --> 15:01.200
Why don't I drive <i>you</i> tonight?

15:01.234 --> 15:03.033
No, no, that's not
what I'm talking...

15:03.067 --> 15:05.000
Whoa! Oh,
here's the place!

15:05.033 --> 15:06.267
Oh.

15:10.167 --> 15:12.868
"The Enchanted
Island Ballroom."

15:12.901 --> 15:16.067
Yeah, I've got to meet
some friends of mine here.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.734
They're going to a dance.

15:17.767 --> 15:19.400
I've <i>got</i> to show up.

15:19.434 --> 15:22.133
Uh, now, uh, would
you, uh, wait for me?

15:22.167 --> 15:25.567
I, uh, shouldn't be
more than two or three hours.

15:25.601 --> 15:26.834
Two or three hours!

15:26.868 --> 15:29.100
Well, uh, how about
if I come back?

15:29.133 --> 15:30.267
Oh, no, wait.

15:30.300 --> 15:33.767
Say, why don't
you just come in?

15:33.801 --> 15:36.067
Come on, Dee, you have
to be kidding.

15:36.100 --> 15:37.634
No! Nobody even knows you

15:37.667 --> 15:39.734
and it's lovely
and warm in there

15:39.767 --> 15:42.000
and there's plenty
to eat and drink.

15:42.033 --> 15:43.801
You can listen
to the music.

15:43.834 --> 15:44.868
No, no, I think

15:44.901 --> 15:46.968
I'd feel out
of place, thank you.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.400
Oh, they wouldn't
notice you, dear.

15:50.434 --> 15:51.968
Look, I'm not dressed.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.234
Oh, sure, nothing
could be dressier

15:54.267 --> 15:55.767
than a cashmere jacket.

15:55.801 --> 15:57.100
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

15:57.133 --> 15:58.968
Well, I think
I'd need a tie.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.067
Oh, yeah.

16:00.100 --> 16:02.067
Merry Christmas.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.701
( <i>orchestra plays</i>
 <i>fox-trot music</i> )

16:19.501 --> 16:22.067
Listen, Dee, I'll be
waiting over there.

16:22.100 --> 16:24.801
When you want to leave,
come get me, okay?

16:24.834 --> 16:27.167
Aw, no, come on
and visit a little.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.267
Dee, I don't know
anybody here.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.968
Oh, sure you do.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.934
Uh, there's, uh,
Emily Simmons

16:32.968 --> 16:35.634
the one I told you
had 37 grandchildren.

16:35.667 --> 16:36.667
Oh, yeah.

16:36.701 --> 16:39.000
And there's
Mary Trueworthy.

16:39.033 --> 16:40.467
She's in DAR.

16:40.501 --> 16:45.701
And, uh, there's the gal
I told you had three facelifts.

16:45.734 --> 16:47.133
Bertha Farris.

16:47.167 --> 16:48.701
That's her.

16:48.734 --> 16:50.601
My God, I know
everybody here.

16:53.767 --> 16:56.234
Look, you see
that man over there

16:56.267 --> 16:58.133
with the,
uh, gray hair?

17:03.267 --> 17:04.867
Are you kidding?

17:05.901 --> 17:07.300
Oh, dear.

17:07.334 --> 17:09.067
I mean... I mean the one

17:09.099 --> 17:11.834
with the white carnation
in his lapel.

17:11.867 --> 17:13.166
Oh.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.867
That's Weldon Manning.

17:14.901 --> 17:18.733
Oh, yeah, I heard
you mention him.

17:18.767 --> 17:21.666
Yeah. I've had my eye
on him for a long time.

17:21.701 --> 17:23.634
I'm bringing him
along slowly.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.567
You may not see
any smoke,

17:25.601 --> 17:27.166
but I happen to know

17:27.200 --> 17:29.634
there's a fire
in that furnace.

17:33.100 --> 17:36.434
Oh, he's coming over here.

17:36.467 --> 17:37.734
Hello, Dee.

17:37.767 --> 17:40.634
Weldon, I didn't know
you were coming tonight.

17:40.667 --> 17:42.467
You look lovely
tonight, Dee.

17:42.501 --> 17:44.701
May I have the honor
of this dance?

17:44.734 --> 17:46.000
Oh, certainly.

17:46.033 --> 17:47.534
Would you excuse us, Alex?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.534
Yes, certainly.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.767
Thank you.

17:49.801 --> 17:52.634
I'll just be over here
holding up the wall.

17:57.734 --> 18:00.267
That's a cutie
you're with tonight.

18:00.300 --> 18:01.834
Excuse me?

18:01.868 --> 18:05.300
Oh. I'm with the one over
there, with the fox stole.

18:06.901 --> 18:09.267
That's the only thing
foxy about her.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.667
Yeah, that's too bad.

18:10.701 --> 18:12.767
Well, my Maserati
needs a tune-up,

18:12.801 --> 18:16.167
and sometimes it's hard
to make ends meet, you know?

18:16.200 --> 18:17.434
Yeah. I wonder

18:17.467 --> 18:19.367
when the government
will get around

18:19.400 --> 18:21.434
to socialized
Maserati tune-ups?

18:21.467 --> 18:22.534
Yes!

18:22.567 --> 18:24.200
Do you drive
one yourself?

18:24.234 --> 18:25.467
No.

18:25.501 --> 18:26.701
Actually I drive

18:26.734 --> 18:28.834
a different car
every night.

18:28.868 --> 18:31.734
Hey, <i>¡bueno!</i>

18:31.767 --> 18:33.467
 <i>¡Mucho mejor!</i>

18:35.234 --> 18:38.200
Sometimes I wonder whether
it's all worth it--

18:38.234 --> 18:40.968
you know, spending hours
under the sun lamp,

18:41.000 --> 18:43.734
visiting the hair stylist
four times a week

18:43.767 --> 18:46.267
doing pushups, situps,
day after day...

18:46.300 --> 18:49.300
Aw, a man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

18:49.334 --> 18:50.534
Yes.

18:50.567 --> 18:53.634
By the way, they, uh...
they call me Ramon.

18:53.667 --> 18:54.634
Oh.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.534
Call me, uh, Tandalayo.

18:59.667 --> 19:02.400
Hey, Tandalayo, are
you new on the circuit?

19:02.434 --> 19:05.434
Well, actually, Ramon,
I'm not on the circuit.

19:05.467 --> 19:07.300
I'm just here
with a friend.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.934
You mean you're dating
grandma for nothing?

19:11.968 --> 19:13.167
Now, look, Ramon,

19:13.200 --> 19:15.634
in the first place,
she's not a grandma,

19:15.667 --> 19:17.968
in the second place,
we're not dating

19:18.000 --> 19:21.200
and in the third place,
she's just a friend of mine.

19:21.234 --> 19:23.601
Hey, you're sensitive--
they like that.

19:23.634 --> 19:24.934
You will do well.

19:24.968 --> 19:28.734
Oh, excuse me, my lady
just got out a cigarette.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.434
Duty calls, you know.

19:30.467 --> 19:32.701
Yup.

19:32.734 --> 19:34.033
I like your tie.

19:34.067 --> 19:35.300
Thanks. I like your ribs.

19:35.334 --> 19:37.667
Hey, thank you.

19:41.601 --> 19:43.100
Hey, Alex...

19:43.133 --> 19:47.000
I'm afraid I have to spend
most of the evening with Weldon.

19:47.033 --> 19:49.000
Well, he seems
like a nice man.

19:49.033 --> 19:52.868
Yes, but, we can still have
one dance, can't we?

19:52.901 --> 19:53.968
I'd be charmed.

20:29.534 --> 20:32.133
Wasn't it great?

20:32.167 --> 20:34.267
Yeah, great.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.667
Aw, lighten up
a little.

20:36.701 --> 20:38.234
For a young guy,

20:38.267 --> 20:41.634
you can be a real
drip sometimes.

20:41.667 --> 20:44.200
I won the Rhumba
contest, didn't I?

20:44.234 --> 20:46.701
Uh, no, <i>I</i> won
the Rhumba contest.

20:46.734 --> 20:48.200
I was carrying <i>you.</i>

20:48.234 --> 20:51.100
Dee, I didn't ask
to go to that dance.

20:51.133 --> 20:54.567
Oh, well next time, try to get
into the spirit of the thing.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.701
I'm not going to any more
dances, please.

20:56.734 --> 20:58.501
Oh, you just felt
self-conscious

20:58.534 --> 21:00.534
because your coat
is too small for you.

21:00.567 --> 21:01.934
Next time I'll get you

21:01.968 --> 21:04.367
a white suit like
that guy Ramon had.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.767
Dee, Dee, I think it's time

21:05.801 --> 21:07.968
we called a halt
to this whole arrangement.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.367
What do you mean?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.734
We can't go on seeing
each other like this.

21:11.767 --> 21:12.868
We can't?

21:12.901 --> 21:13.801
No!

21:14.834 --> 21:16.834
I mean, look,
it's okay, I...

21:16.868 --> 21:19.467
we can see each other
once in a while,

21:19.501 --> 21:21.367
but, please,
no more money.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.200
I can't handle it,
please.

21:23.234 --> 21:25.133
No more money, okay?

21:26.701 --> 21:28.400
I guess it's good-bye.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.400
What?

21:31.434 --> 21:33.968
Wouldn't be the same
without the money.

21:34.000 --> 21:36.801
What are you talking about?

21:36.834 --> 21:39.400
Well, money may not
mean that much to you

21:39.434 --> 21:42.400
but to me, it ranks
right up there with oxygen.

21:42.434 --> 21:45.634
It's the best way there is
of dealing with people.

21:45.667 --> 21:46.767
What about friendship?

21:46.801 --> 21:49.834
Well, next time you go
into a restaurant

21:49.868 --> 21:51.567
you tell the Maitre d'

21:51.601 --> 21:55.434
if he gives you a good table,
you'll be his buddy.

21:55.467 --> 21:58.234
Well, then, give your money
to Maitre d's and waitresses,

21:58.267 --> 21:59.300
somebody who wants it.

21:59.334 --> 22:01.300
But you don't have
to give me money, Dee.

22:01.334 --> 22:02.467
No, I know that

22:02.501 --> 22:05.200
but it wouldn't be
the same without money.

22:05.234 --> 22:07.300
I wouldn't be able
to trust you.

22:07.334 --> 22:09.567
You'd be more casual
about calling.

22:09.601 --> 22:11.133
You wouldn't be on time.

22:11.167 --> 22:13.801
Money makes people punctual.

22:13.834 --> 22:17.400
I know people gave their
whole lives to their children.

22:17.434 --> 22:20.200
Those children don't
even come to see them.

22:20.234 --> 22:23.000
If I had any kids,
you can bet your buttons

22:23.033 --> 22:27.434
I would put them on my payroll,
and they'd come to see me.

22:27.467 --> 22:29.434
Especially on payday.

22:29.467 --> 22:31.901
Aw, come on, don't
let's argue, Alex.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.000
I had a wonderful
time tonight.

22:34.033 --> 22:36.868
Here, come and pick me up
tomorrow at 4:00.

22:36.901 --> 22:38.534
I'm having my hair done.

22:38.567 --> 22:41.200
Damn it!
You are the most...

22:41.234 --> 22:42.334
Never mind.

22:42.367 --> 22:43.334
What?

22:43.367 --> 22:44.901
No, it's better
I don't say anything.

22:44.934 --> 22:47.467
No, say what you were thinking.

22:47.501 --> 22:49.567
I'm old enough
to take it.

22:49.601 --> 22:51.200
Okay, you want to hear
what I'm thinking?

22:51.234 --> 22:52.467
I'll tell you
what I'm thinking.

22:52.501 --> 22:54.000
I think this whole
arrangement stinks.

22:54.033 --> 22:56.334
I have never felt
so used in all my life.

22:56.367 --> 22:58.868
You know, I thought
that you really liked me.

22:58.901 --> 23:00.467
I thought we were friends.

23:00.501 --> 23:02.234
But that wasn't
what you had in mind, was it?

23:02.267 --> 23:05.367
I was just
a piece of merchandise.

23:05.400 --> 23:08.868
Why do I sound
like Joan Crawford?

23:08.901 --> 23:12.868
Aw, don't stop,
it was just starting to be fun.

23:12.901 --> 23:16.200
Well, it may be fun for you
but it's not fun for me.

23:16.234 --> 23:19.567
I really don't enjoy being
with people I don't like.

23:19.601 --> 23:22.267
And I... I don't
like you anymore.

23:24.868 --> 23:28.367
Horse manure, you love me.

23:28.400 --> 23:31.467
( <i>chuckling</i> )

23:31.501 --> 23:32.901
Yeah, I guess I do.

23:32.934 --> 23:35.734
Can we still have
lunch together?

23:35.767 --> 23:37.033
Okay, but only
if I pay.

23:37.067 --> 23:40.534
Aw, you're sweet, Alex.

23:40.567 --> 23:42.767
I just hope my stomach

23:42.801 --> 23:46.868
can take those dumps
you can afford.

23:56.901 --> 23:59.901
( <i>theme music playing</i> )

24:23.934 --> 24:25.734
WOMAN:
Good night,
Mr. Walters.
