Lots of room.

01:13.141 --> 01:16.577

01:16.644 --> 01:18.346
Before we melt,

the binder? I just--

- Yeah. Do you mind
holding it?
- Oh, here, here, here.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.169
Got it, got it.
No worries. No worries.

01:41.202 --> 01:44.205

Everybody say Cindy Lou.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.348
All: Cindy Lou.

01:54.415 --> 01:57.050
Oh, my gosh, guys.

01:58.286 --> 01:59.487
How about a
Jewish reference?

01:59.553 --> 02:01.189
A Jewish reference.
Sure.

- Okay, Reggie.

02:07.395 --> 02:09.530
Just take
the pictures,
for God sakes.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.400
- A little pejorative, right?
- A little anti Semitic,
but that's fine.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.467
I'm just tryin' to
lighten it up.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.802
Reggie, we gotta
keep it moving,

02:14.868 --> 02:16.204
I gotta get

All: Hanukkah.

02:20.208 --> 02:21.375

None of these words
end in a smile.

Okay, the Cashmans.
I need the Cashmans
to come over.

02:26.547 --> 02:27.815

Just a little bit down.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.613
Uh, I think we paid for
more than one photograph.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.715
If everybody focuses,
we could get this picture.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.417
Absolutely. Let's take
the five dollar photo.

Ali: I'm not going

anything,

04:59.633 --> 05:01.369
but I'm not a fucking

05:01.402 --> 05:03.236
I'm just a guest
at this wedding.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.806
No. You're the one who
tried to talk her out of
being with me.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.841
Okay, tonight I'm
putting it in my calendar,

05:07.908 --> 05:09.377

05:09.377 --> 05:11.278
- remind brother's
girlfriend--
- Good.

05:11.379 --> 05:13.814
You might have been
mistaken about him
being a sex addict.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.383
- Not tonight, though.
- Number one.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.484

We just peed on a stick.
It's early days.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.187

Yep, he did.
And you know what?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.459
I'm not gonna
apologize to her.

05:58.526 --> 05:59.927
I don't care if
she's pregnant.

Don't be churning stuff,

I know.
I know it's your day.
That's what I'm saying.

06:06.333 --> 06:07.835
Why did he have to
pull me aside and
make it all about him?

06:07.901 --> 06:09.336
Why did you have to
come here and tell me?

06:09.437 --> 06:11.805
Now you're making it
all about you.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.241
Does this--
the outside of my brow
look ebony to you?

06:14.307 --> 06:15.709
I feel like it's
a little ebony.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.745
Am I crazy?
Did we talk about
mahogany,

06:17.811 --> 06:19.312
'cause I feel like
we talked about mahogany,

06:19.447 --> 06:21.048
and this is a little ebony.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.517
It's two fuckin' kids.
It's like insta-family.

It's a lunatic

come on.
- Get back here.

Okay, kids.
You know what I
just realized?

06:47.708 --> 06:50.478
We need to go rehearse your

06:50.511 --> 06:51.979
Oh, this is
terribly important.

06:52.045 --> 06:54.181
- Oh, my God.
- It's important, yeah.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.583

- You have the most
important job in the wedding.

06:55.649 --> 06:56.884
But you're not
gonna compete.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.385
We have to make sure
it's perfect. Ready?

06:58.486 --> 06:59.987
Gracie has more yellow
flower petals than me.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.022
We are gonna get some more

upset you.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.140
- Talkin' to people?
- Yep. Yeah.

08:27.207 --> 08:29.242
- People talkin' to you?
- Yes, they are, yes.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.578
People are being
really nice.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.279
- Good, good.
- It's really great.

08:32.345 --> 08:35.215
I want you to relax, man.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.818
These are your people.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.020
Love you no matter what.

08:41.589 --> 08:42.756
I love you, too.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.858
Ali: Okay, people.
People, listen.

08:44.925 --> 08:47.961
There is no bride side
and groom side.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.097
There-- bride side
and bride side.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.099
You know what I mean.
Just sit anywhere.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.002
- Hey.
- I need to talk to you.

08:55.068 --> 08:55.803
Uh-oh.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.438
Who invited
your Aunt Brina?

08:58.505 --> 08:59.740
Oh, shit.
I'm sorry.

08:59.807 --> 09:01.675
I'm sorry,
I meant to tell you that.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.476
Listen, we were
just nervous.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.012
Sarah has no friends.
She has no friends.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.413
- That's kind of sad.
- Oh, my God.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.648
Len got all the friends
in the divorce,

09:07.715 --> 09:09.617
and Tammy has
so many people.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.619
So we just, you know,
they're Facebook friends,

09:11.619 --> 09:13.320
- and it just--
we wanted to--
- They're Facebook friends?

09:13.386 --> 09:16.056
Yes, they've been playing
Bejeweled Blitz for months now.

09:16.123 --> 09:18.291
- What?
- What is Bejeweled Bliss?

09:18.358 --> 09:20.060
Bejeweled Blitz.

09:20.127 --> 09:23.463
It's a video game with
colored diamond jewels

09:23.530 --> 09:24.765
that you line up.

09:24.832 --> 09:27.200
There's this weird ass cat
with laser eyes

09:27.267 --> 09:28.268
in the bonus round.

09:33.741 --> 09:36.009
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.079
- Mazel tov on your simcha.
- Mm, thank you.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.113
Thank you.

09:43.550 --> 09:46.053
My God.

09:46.119 --> 09:47.655
Look at you.

09:47.688 --> 09:48.856
Okay.

09:52.726 --> 09:53.894
Look at me.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.902
Listen, uh,
just to be clear.

10:01.969 --> 10:05.138
I didn't think Mom
could handle... this,

10:05.205 --> 10:06.807
so that's why
I haven't been by
to see her.

10:06.874 --> 10:08.842
You didn't see her
before all of this.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.110
Is that why you're here,
to remind me of that?

10:10.177 --> 10:11.979
No, I'm here because
Sarah invited me.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.682
- Oh.
- I don't know
why she did.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.216
Nor do I,

10:16.283 --> 10:18.185
but here you are.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.388
- I'll take my seat.
- Do that.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.256
- Before anybody
tries to get it.
- All right.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.067
- Judy.
- Congratulations.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.869
- Thank you.
- Mother of the bride.

10:35.936 --> 10:37.437
Thank you.
You look good.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.571
Did you change
your hair color?

10:38.638 --> 10:39.907
I did a little bit.
Oh, my God,

10:39.973 --> 10:41.709
are you sure that
he is one of us?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.210
He doesn't look like
one of us.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.445
You're gonna ask me again?
We had the DNA test.

10:45.512 --> 10:49.282
He's Joshy's.
That build comes from
Rita's father.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.618
He was a Norwegian
shot-putter, apparently.

10:51.685 --> 10:52.853
Whoa.

10:53.586 --> 10:55.889
[mouthing]

10:56.824 --> 10:58.058
- Hello.
- Oh, my God.

10:58.125 --> 10:59.559
- [laughs] Hi.
- Hi.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.962
- Hi, Rabbi.
- Hi, guys.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.231
God, look at this.
Look at this.

11:04.297 --> 11:06.466
- Stop it.
- So scrumptious.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.002
I just wanna like--
You're like a
Twinkie right now.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.972
- Take it easy, dude.
- You're like a hot towel
in first class.

11:12.039 --> 11:13.874
- Swear to God.
- Is it the yarmulke?

11:13.941 --> 11:15.075
- Yes.
- Get outta here.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.476
[laughing]

11:16.543 --> 11:19.579
- Go.
- Okay. I'll see you
up there.

11:19.646 --> 11:21.514
Man: Everyone,
please be seated.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.184
The ceremony
is about to begin.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.389
Well, was sh-- she
at least cordial to you?

11:29.456 --> 11:31.825
No. Is a lizard cordial?

11:31.892 --> 11:35.162
She's a filing cabinet
with a hairdo.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.264
I mean, she hated me
when I was male,

11:37.330 --> 11:40.333
and-and, you know,
and when she was little,

11:40.400 --> 11:43.336
she used to accuse me
of wearing her clothes.

11:43.403 --> 11:44.537
Did you?

11:44.604 --> 11:46.406
Of course, I did,
but--

11:46.473 --> 11:49.009
Listen, she's gone on record
as being anti gay,

11:49.076 --> 11:50.778
so I don't know
what the fuck
she's doing here.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.345
- The free food.
- No, no, no, no.

11:52.412 --> 11:55.048
Not the free food.
Get a gander at this.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.150
- Oh.
- That's why she's here.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.153
- Oh, my God.
- Oh. Oh.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.654
Look at you.
You okay?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.023
- Yeah.
- You look beautiful.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.557
- Thanks.
- Whenever you're ready.

12:04.624 --> 12:05.793
- I have a question.
- Yeah?

12:05.793 --> 12:08.661
Did you-- did you invite
Aunt Bri here?

12:08.796 --> 12:09.963
Yeah.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.098
- How can you--
- Why did you do that?

12:11.164 --> 12:12.199
Because I don't have
any people.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.801
How can you
do that to me?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.068
- We don't--
- We're your people.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.170
Huh? I don't
understand.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.106
And you're-- you're
Facebook friends?

12:19.172 --> 12:21.241
If she's a little
anxious today,
it's understandable.

12:21.308 --> 12:22.876
I was anxious
on my wedding day, too.

12:22.943 --> 12:24.444
I was hopped up
on diet pills.

12:24.511 --> 12:26.914
You know what?
Brina could have brought
Grandma Rose.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.148
That would have been
beautiful.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.917
Yes, it would have been
beautiful,

12:29.983 --> 12:32.085
but Grandma Rose is sick
and she's in a wheelchair.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.186
Oh, okay, so she's
in a wheelchair.

12:33.253 --> 12:34.922
People in wheelchairs
go places.

12:34.988 --> 12:38.325
I was at Disneyland
and we were on the
Small World ride,

12:38.391 --> 12:40.227
and there was a woman with
a wheelchair on the ride.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.062
With-- with an
oxygen tank.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.131
I mean, if you love people,
you can take them places.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.632
Okay, good.
Well, by all means,

12:45.698 --> 12:47.667
let's do what they do
at Small World.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.571
[exhales]

12:51.638 --> 12:53.373
You took diet pills?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.275
- You knew that.
- No, I didn't know that.

12:55.342 --> 12:56.844
That's why the house
was so clean.

12:56.877 --> 12:57.911
Is that why you
fired Nobby?

12:57.978 --> 12:59.346
No, no.
Well, partly,

12:59.412 --> 13:01.314
but I just wanted to
save us some of the money

13:01.381 --> 13:02.715
because I could
do it myself.

13:02.850 --> 13:04.084
- All right.
- Sarah.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.921
Thanks, Dad.

Not necessarily.

19:51.291 --> 19:54.427
**

19:58.331 --> 20:02.034
Sarah. Sarah.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.804
- Hey.
- [heavy breathing]

20:04.871 --> 20:07.540
Why did you
let me marry her?

20:07.607 --> 20:09.976
- Did you not want to?
- No!

20:10.042 --> 20:12.412
No.
I didn't want to.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.347
I didn't want to.
Why did you let me?

20:14.414 --> 20:15.548
Oh, my God.
What did I do?

20:15.615 --> 20:17.284
You're just having
a moment.

20:17.350 --> 20:19.218
- I think this happens.
- I'm not. I wish
I was having--

20:19.286 --> 20:22.489
You know what? The whole
fucking relationship
with Tammy was a moment.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.191
This. This.
This is fuckin' real.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.459
- I have to pee.
- Oh.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.761
[sobbing]
This is like--
This is forever.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.264
I mean, I didn't want
to leave Len.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.867
[sobbing]
I don't even know
what I want to do.

20:34.934 --> 20:36.769
I'm just
totally pathetic.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.705
Shh. Okay.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.574
Just right now,
just breathe.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.510
Ohh.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.446
I fucking hate Tammy.

20:46.513 --> 20:49.115
I hate her and I hate
her stupid fuckin' family.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.217
Those fuckin' WASPs.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.885
- Just breathe.
- Okay, hold on.

20:52.952 --> 20:54.954
I can't--
It's real hard
'cause you're here,

20:55.021 --> 20:57.757
It's like I know I have to
but it's not letting me.

20:57.824 --> 21:00.126
- Do you want me to go?
- No, I don't want you to go.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.829
- [sobbing] I don't
want you to go.
- Shh, shh, shh.

21:02.895 --> 21:04.697
Just be quiet
for a second.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.969
- [woman singing in Hebrew]
- Wait, wait. Wait.

21:10.036 --> 21:11.371
You guys, wait.
Hold on.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.673
I still don't have Sarah,
hold on. Whoa.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.543
Hey, whoa.
Maura, Shelly.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.845
Where's Sarah?
I can't find Sarah
anywhere.

21:18.911 --> 21:23.350
While we are waiting
for the bride,

21:23.383 --> 21:28.988
let's celebrate Joshy's
brand new baby.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.691
[all exclaiming]

21:36.062 --> 21:38.498
[singing in Hebrew]

21:38.565 --> 21:40.266
Come with me.
I need your help.

21:40.367 --> 21:43.002
- Come on.
- Josh.

21:44.537 --> 21:46.138
Who did you tell that
we are pregnant?

21:46.205 --> 21:47.674
Nobody.

21:47.740 --> 21:48.941
How does your mom know?

21:49.008 --> 21:50.710
She doesn't know.

21:50.777 --> 21:53.112
[sobbing]

21:53.179 --> 21:55.147
- Rachael: Okay.
- Oh, my God.

21:55.214 --> 21:57.984
- You okay, honey?
Do you need some--
- Sarah: I'm not okay.

21:58.050 --> 22:01.388
I don't want to be married.
I don't want to be married.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.723
Oh, my God,
I'm fucking stuck with her

22:03.790 --> 22:05.592
for the rest of
my fucking life.

22:05.658 --> 22:10.029
Like, legally bound
to that fucking woman.

22:10.096 --> 22:11.698
It's done.

22:11.764 --> 22:14.100
Rachael:
Well, I mean, it's--

22:14.166 --> 22:16.969
it's-- it's not done yet.

22:17.036 --> 22:21.408
I mean, Jewish-wise,
you are married.

22:21.408 --> 22:24.477
But--

22:24.544 --> 22:28.748
I mean,
legally, you're not.

22:28.815 --> 22:31.017
Yet.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.185
What do you mean?

22:33.252 --> 22:35.054
We signed the license.

22:36.255 --> 22:37.524
I still need to
send it to the city,

22:37.590 --> 22:39.291
they have to--
they have a special stamp.

22:39.426 --> 22:40.993
They have to put
the stamp on it.

22:41.060 --> 22:43.596
Wait, did you--
So you haven't sent
that thing in?

22:43.663 --> 22:45.732
When would I have
mailed it, Sarah?

22:45.798 --> 22:47.500
You know, right after
the ceremony,

22:47.567 --> 22:49.869
I would have just left.
In these heels.

22:49.936 --> 22:51.070
Walked into
downtown Palm Springs.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.939
In the heat.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.340
- Found a mailbox.
- Are you, like, gonna be
a smartass?

22:54.441 --> 22:55.708
I'm asking you-- Yeah.

22:55.775 --> 22:58.645
I actually am
taking this very seriously.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.012
I did not send it in.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.848
So I'm not.

23:01.914 --> 23:03.149
That's correct.

23:03.215 --> 23:04.283
You're not married.

23:04.350 --> 23:08.455
Um, okay, so what is
a wedding then?

23:08.488 --> 23:10.089
I mean--

23:10.156 --> 23:11.524
It's a ritual.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.225
It's a pageant.

23:13.292 --> 23:15.795
It's like a very
expensive play.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.730
That's genius.
It's a play.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.566
And we're just
in costume.

23:19.632 --> 23:20.900
And you're not married.

23:23.102 --> 23:24.471
- I'm not?
- Nope.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.372
I'm not married.

23:26.473 --> 23:28.475
It's an expensive...

23:28.508 --> 23:29.842
- play.
- I'm not married.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.011
- It's theater.
- I'm not married.

23:33.546 --> 23:34.847
- I'm not married.
- You're not married.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.749
I'm not married.
I'm not married.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.117
- You're not married.
- I'm not married.

[singing in Hebrew]

23:54.834 --> 23:55.868
Sarah?

24:00.507 --> 24:02.008
Honey, are you okay?

24:02.074 --> 24:04.176
She's fine.
She's fine.

24:06.513 --> 24:09.516
Hey. Hey. Hey.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.217
Hey. Come here.
Hey, baby.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.552
Baby, come here.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.135
[glasses clinking]

24:41.147 --> 24:43.349
- Hold on one second.
- Okay.

24:43.415 --> 24:45.652
Uh, Bri.

24:45.718 --> 24:49.589
Um, I just want to
thank you both for, uh--

24:49.656 --> 24:51.057
For coming.
You were great.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.959
I'm gonna get
the car, Mom.

24:55.628 --> 24:56.929
Listen, I want to, uh--

24:56.996 --> 24:58.765
I want to come by,
I want to see Mom.

24:58.831 --> 25:01.233
Oh, really?
You want to see Mom.

25:03.369 --> 25:04.804
Don't you dare,
Mort.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.575
You let that woman
get off this planet

25:08.641 --> 25:11.310
without knowing
about this.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.646
Can you do that?

25:13.713 --> 25:16.082
Could you do something
for somebody else?

25:32.932 --> 25:36.603
I told Ali
about the baby.

25:36.603 --> 25:39.471
She must have
said something.

25:39.606 --> 25:41.974
I'm so sorry.

25:42.041 --> 25:44.343
- I thought we were gonna--
- Yeah.

25:44.410 --> 25:46.713
Wait and tell people
together.

25:46.779 --> 25:49.749
Yeah, I just--

25:49.816 --> 25:54.220
I wanted her to be
nicer to you.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.688
Please don't
do that to me.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.691
Betray me and then
tell me it's a gift.

26:20.647 --> 26:23.482
I know what you're doing.

26:23.549 --> 26:25.752
Expecting me to
disappoint you.

26:27.319 --> 26:29.689
And then I do and
it's like, oh, great.

26:29.756 --> 26:32.925
But I want you to know
that I told Ali that

26:32.992 --> 26:34.360
because I was excited.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.731
And so, yeah, I fucked up,
I made a mistake.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.833
But I don't want to feel
like you are, like,

26:40.900 --> 26:42.401
sittin' around
collecting wrongs,

26:42.468 --> 26:43.670
or waiting for me
to fuck up

26:43.703 --> 26:44.937
so you can
prove to yourself

26:45.004 --> 26:47.774
that this relationship
is wrong. Okay?

26:47.840 --> 26:50.509
Or that you're
not lovable.

* I want you more
than I need you *

26:55.181 --> 26:56.716

* I need you so bad *

26:59.151 --> 27:01.387
We both are.

* Are you comin' back? *

27:04.056 --> 27:07.193
- Sarah: I'm sorry,
I can't.
- Tammy: Oh.

* I'm waiting *

feel beautiful.

Because you are
so beautiful.

* I haven't had a dream
in a long time *
