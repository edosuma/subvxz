24:35.660 --> 24:36.796
in the same house together.

24:36.829 --> 24:38.900
(both chuckle)

24:38.933 --> 24:41.872
Okay, this has got to be
some kind of joke, right?

24:41.906 --> 24:43.175
I mean, what do you do?
Do you just

24:43.208 --> 24:44.778
come in here
and fuck with people

24:44.812 --> 24:47.551
on Halloween night
who sneak in? Right?

24:47.584 --> 24:50.557
It's the farthest thing
from a joke.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.926
I'm in hell.

24:52.894 --> 24:54.531
And don't start telling me
it's all my fault

24:54.565 --> 24:56.736
like that other therapist
in here.

24:56.769 --> 24:59.140
I didn't want to cheat
on my wife.

24:59.173 --> 25:01.879
I resisted for years

25:01.912 --> 25:03.616
in this house.

25:03.649 --> 25:07.691
But Hayden is really persistent,

25:07.724 --> 25:10.530
and Vivien can be
so judgy and sullen

25:10.563 --> 25:12.701
‐sometimes.
‐So, you're blaming
the women in your life

25:12.734 --> 25:14.638
for you being a cheater? Okay.

25:14.671 --> 25:18.579
Um, you can never
actually find forgiveness

25:18.613 --> 25:21.819
if you don't take responsibility
for your own actions.

25:21.852 --> 25:24.792
I'm just saying
life is complicated.

25:24.825 --> 25:27.296
And so is death, apparently.

25:27.329 --> 25:29.568
The problem was

25:29.601 --> 25:32.674
I always thought
I could have it all.

25:32.708 --> 25:35.112
A wife and a mistress.

25:35.145 --> 25:39.120
A family
and a life outside my house.

25:39.153 --> 25:41.726
So I ended up here

25:41.759 --> 25:43.663
with nothing.

25:44.631 --> 25:46.134
Judging by that look
on your face,

25:46.167 --> 25:49.006
my professional opinion
is that you were cheated on.

25:49.040 --> 25:51.211
‐You look triggered.
‐No. Uh...

25:51.244 --> 25:54.250
(chuckles) Actually, uh,
Steven was faithful.

25:54.283 --> 25:57.858
I'm judging you just because,
I don't know, I can.

25:57.891 --> 25:59.862
(clears throat) The trouble
in my marriage was me,

25:59.895 --> 26:01.565
if I want to be honest.

26:01.599 --> 26:03.268
Okay? I like to want things,

26:03.301 --> 26:05.239
and then I get obsessed
about getting them.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.343
It's compelling in a courtship.

26:07.376 --> 26:09.615
Everybody wants to feel
like they're wanted.

26:09.648 --> 26:12.754
‐Hmm.
‐I'm just not so great
once I actually get it

26:12.788 --> 26:15.092
'cause, um, over time, I...

26:15.125 --> 26:17.296
(inhales, clears throat)

26:17.329 --> 26:19.768
I get bored.

26:19.802 --> 26:22.874
And then I can be quite hurtful.

26:22.908 --> 26:26.715
You like being hungry
more than being fed.

26:27.684 --> 26:28.786
Yes.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.322
Yes, yes, yes.

26:30.355 --> 26:32.159
Okay, so, here's...

26:32.193 --> 26:35.165
What I'm really hungering for
now is an understanding.

26:35.199 --> 26:38.639
Tell me... Tell me
what this place is like. I mean,

26:38.673 --> 26:41.311
I want to know what
it truly feels like to be here

26:41.344 --> 26:44.317
and to feel the‐the longing
and the‐the fear,

26:44.350 --> 26:46.187
‐the fun.
‐Fun?

26:46.221 --> 26:48.626
Is it fun when the record

26:48.659 --> 26:51.665
you're listening to
skips over and over?

26:51.699 --> 26:54.638
Is it fun being
on a merry‐go‐round for decades?

26:54.671 --> 26:56.007
‐No.
‐(chuckles)

26:56.040 --> 26:58.913
Uh, I'm...
I'm designing a video game.

26:58.946 --> 27:00.683
And for it to work,
it's got to be fun.

27:00.717 --> 27:02.353
It's got to have purpose.

27:02.386 --> 27:04.323
You know, there's got to be
a point so that the player's

27:04.357 --> 27:07.129
‐gonna want to continue playing.
‐There is no purpose here.

27:07.163 --> 27:10.035
There is no point in here.

27:10.068 --> 27:14.678
It's just endless dull
with no escape.

27:14.711 --> 27:16.214
We're not in hell.
It's an old house

27:16.247 --> 27:18.051
in a neighborhood in L. A.

27:18.084 --> 27:20.155
You know, it's surrounded
by perfectly normal houses.

27:20.189 --> 27:22.059
There's got to be a point,
right?

27:22.092 --> 27:23.830
I mean, maybe there's
even a way to escape.

27:23.863 --> 27:26.234
It's just nobody's
figured out how yet.

27:26.267 --> 27:29.240
You know, my son says that, uh,
the people who are trapped here

27:29.273 --> 27:31.712
are probably stuck because
they never resolved their issues

27:31.745 --> 27:34.985
when they were alive, so their
damage becomes their destiny.

27:35.018 --> 27:39.093
Maybe the point is
that you have to learn and grow,

27:39.126 --> 27:41.699
and only then can you escape.

27:41.732 --> 27:44.671
So you think if I have
intense therapy sessions

27:44.705 --> 27:46.107
with each of the ghosts,

27:46.140 --> 27:47.243
they'll have
some kind of Ordinary People,

27:47.276 --> 27:48.846
Prince of Tides breakthrough

27:48.880 --> 27:50.182
and find spiritual peace?

27:50.215 --> 27:52.219
(laughing)

27:53.288 --> 27:55.125
Sorry.

27:55.158 --> 27:57.998
Not gonna happen.
I tried that with Tate

27:58.031 --> 27:59.267
after I got stuck here,

27:59.300 --> 28:01.237
and he's just as bananas
as he's always been.

28:02.306 --> 28:05.112
Okay. Um...

28:05.145 --> 28:06.414
Well...

28:06.447 --> 28:07.984
Um, can I speak to somebody

28:08.018 --> 28:09.855
who's maybe not so lost
and hopeless?

28:09.888 --> 28:11.992
Then you've come
to the wrong house.

28:13.428 --> 28:15.098
Okay.

28:15.132 --> 28:16.835
Um...

28:19.508 --> 28:21.411
SCARLETT:
Can we help you?

28:21.444 --> 28:22.881
(exhales)

28:22.914 --> 28:24.283
Um, yes.

28:24.317 --> 28:26.354
I'm trying to understand
the vibe of this place,

28:26.387 --> 28:28.425
but all I'm really getting
is that everybody

28:28.458 --> 28:31.865
associated with it is just...
really crazy.

28:32.901 --> 28:35.372
I'm just gonna make a video game
about True Blood or...

28:35.405 --> 28:38.245
‐something normal.
‐You want to get the vibe?

28:38.278 --> 28:41.150
Here's what you need
to understand about this place.

28:41.184 --> 28:44.190
Yes, there are a few spirits
who want out,

28:44.223 --> 28:46.896
but there are others here
who have no interest in growth,

28:46.929 --> 28:49.367
who embrace
how fucked‐up we all are.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.839
Now, the only thing
that we love more

28:51.872 --> 28:53.743
than being stuck
in our own misery

28:53.776 --> 28:55.178
is being stuck here

28:55.212 --> 28:57.416
with the suckers
who are even more miserable.

28:57.449 --> 29:00.322
The repetition is the point.

29:00.355 --> 29:03.328
The endless nothing
filled with pain

29:03.361 --> 29:04.898
is the purpose.

29:04.932 --> 29:06.802
The only thing that we need

29:06.835 --> 29:08.806
is more souls
to feed the suffering.

29:08.839 --> 29:10.375
(snarling)

29:13.181 --> 29:14.283
Shit.

29:14.317 --> 29:15.352
‐What?
‐As your therapist,

29:15.385 --> 29:16.889
my professional opinion is

29:16.922 --> 29:18.826
‐that you should run like hell.
‐What?

29:20.228 --> 29:22.032
Uh...

29:22.066 --> 29:24.170
(grunts, panting)

29:24.203 --> 29:26.542
‐(whimpering)
‐You really don't understand
this place at all.

29:26.575 --> 29:29.413
Leave now or you're gonna be
forced to understand forever.

29:29.447 --> 29:30.950

Oh.

30:14.403 --> 30:16.107
No.

30:17.544 --> 30:19.981
Please don't do that.
We have one night together.

30:20.015 --> 30:22.152
It took a week
for them to find your body.

30:22.186 --> 30:24.156
We didn't even know
you were missing for three days

30:24.190 --> 30:25.827
because you lied

30:25.860 --> 30:27.497
and said you were going
to a horror convention.

30:27.530 --> 30:30.068
‐I'm sorry.
I didn't want you to worry.
‐Bullshit.

30:30.102 --> 30:31.404
You didn't want me
to try and stop you.

30:31.437 --> 30:33.141
It wasn't until
we started getting calls

30:33.174 --> 30:35.278
that we found out
you tried to buy a house.

30:35.312 --> 30:38.084
As soon as I heard that,
I knew where you were.

30:38.118 --> 30:39.387
That I was never gonna
see you again.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.257
That your
stupid fucking obsession

30:41.290 --> 30:42.994
‐got you killed.
‐Listen to me. Hey.

30:43.028 --> 30:45.165
I just wanted to build
something special for us.

30:45.198 --> 30:46.367
I just wanted to make you proud.

30:46.401 --> 30:48.906
By making a video game?

30:48.939 --> 30:51.044
You know what you
could have done to impress me?

30:51.077 --> 30:52.981
If you had went
to a fucking shrink

30:53.014 --> 30:54.450
and dealt with your shit.

30:54.483 --> 30:57.456
If you had shown me
that people can change.

30:57.489 --> 30:59.995
I would've been more proud if
you quit making the fucking game

31:00.028 --> 31:02.299
once you realized
that you couldn't do it,

31:02.332 --> 31:04.638
rather than getting yourself
fucking killed

31:04.671 --> 31:07.176
because you‐you get so trapped
by your obsessions.

31:07.209 --> 31:09.180
Hey. It's too late for that.

31:09.213 --> 31:10.315
It's too late for that.
Look, I'm...

31:10.348 --> 31:12.319
I'm stuck as I am, okay?
I'm stuck

31:12.352 --> 31:13.989
in that place.

31:14.023 --> 31:15.392
There's no escaping
the Murder House.

31:15.425 --> 31:17.429
I think there is.

31:18.632 --> 31:20.570
‐How?
‐Fire.

31:20.603 --> 31:23.475
Fire purifies everything.
You need to burn,

31:23.509 --> 31:25.045
burn that motherfucker
to the ground.

31:25.078 --> 31:27.082
And I'm more than happy
to do the job.

31:27.116 --> 31:28.485
Listen to me. If you do that,

31:28.519 --> 31:29.921
if it works,

31:29.955 --> 31:31.090
I'm gone.
