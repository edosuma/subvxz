00:02.429 --> 00:06.873
From an evolutionary standpoint,
homosexuality is a genetic dead end.

00:08.142 --> 00:09.555
I...

00:09.784 --> 00:11.800
Have told Sonja about you.

00:12.117 --> 00:14.506
We've decided to take a break.

00:14.649 --> 00:17.443
There were people, over the years, who
have chosen to withstand harassment.

00:17.467 --> 00:19.148
People who have been beaten and killed.

00:19.173 --> 00:22.760
And that's not because they
really want to be different.

00:24.312 --> 00:27.455
But because they would rather die, than
to pretend to be someone they're not.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.862
(Hi. It was nice seeing you as well.
I don't know, but things might have

00:29.886 --> 00:32.332
gone a little too quickly... I know
it's my fault, but I need time, sorry.)

00:32.356 --> 00:34.720
You know that thing about me
being a little weird lately...?

00:35.268 --> 00:37.173
It's because of a person I like.

00:38.336 --> 00:39.360
It's not a girl.

00:39.860 --> 00:40.860
What's his name?

00:41.026 --> 00:42.026
Even.

00:43.129 --> 00:44.970
Like, he's got to break up
with his girlfriend.

00:49.016 --> 00:49.881
That's Alex.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.341
Wow. He's got a guitar and stuff.

00:51.366 --> 00:53.055
Can you swipe right, don't click on the...

00:53.080 --> 00:54.167
He looks cool, though.

00:54.192 --> 00:56.714
The point is that you can pick
for yourself, when you get Tinder

00:56.739 --> 00:57.739
You can log on, uh...

00:57.778 --> 00:58.778
Excuse me...?

00:58.919 --> 01:00.640
Meet a lot of nice people

01:00.665 --> 01:02.030
And do what you want with them.

01:02.055 --> 01:03.680
I'm not getting Tinder. No.

01:03.736 --> 01:04.736
Why not?

01:05.458 --> 01:08.387
Why not? Isn't that quite obvious?

01:08.466 --> 01:11.950
When I've kind of got a guy already.

01:12.133 --> 01:13.649
Yeah, but he lives in London, Noora.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.593
Now you're just being mean.

01:14.618 --> 01:16.228
No, I just mean that...

01:16.253 --> 01:19.038
You're the kind of person who
always does the right thing...

01:19.569 --> 01:21.212
Who always has to be so good.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.736
Can't you just jump into it?

01:24.252 --> 01:25.252
You know...

01:26.363 --> 01:26.673
No.

01:26.698 --> 01:27.990
Do like this, "wuh".

01:28.934 --> 01:30.274
Wuh, yeah. Exactly.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.585
Now I feel like you're on the...

01:31.610 --> 01:32.084
Yes, ok...

01:32.109 --> 01:32.617
Noora!

01:32.642 --> 01:34.030
Bye, Eskild!

01:34.117 --> 01:35.331
Love you!

01:36.979 --> 01:38.725
Difficult! Jesus Christ.

01:38.963 --> 01:41.701
Everyone knows that William
isn't going to come.

01:42.931 --> 01:44.280
Jesus...

01:49.080 --> 01:50.080
Eskild?

01:50.192 --> 01:51.477
Can I ask you a question?

01:52.287 --> 01:54.374
Isak, seriously! Now...

01:56.414 --> 01:58.104
Yes, I accept your apology.

01:58.129 --> 01:59.680
It's okay. I mean...

02:00.222 --> 02:02.238
For the last time, I'm not mad at you.

02:02.627 --> 02:03.896
Okay? I...

02:04.657 --> 02:07.228
I understand why you said
what you said, and now

02:07.284 --> 02:08.307
I'm done with it.

02:08.339 --> 02:09.807
So now you don't have to

02:11.419 --> 02:12.972
Walk around here like a...

02:12.997 --> 02:13.998
You're driving me crazy!

02:14.023 --> 02:15.751
That's not it.
I seriously need an advice...

02:22.322 --> 02:23.338
From me?

02:26.155 --> 02:28.894
Okay, you want an advice from 'moi'?

02:29.536 --> 02:30.036
Yes.

02:30.061 --> 02:30.703
You want that?

02:31.022 --> 02:32.133
Because...

02:33.006 --> 02:34.006
You trust me?

02:34.466 --> 02:35.895
And look up to me?

02:37.387 --> 02:38.387
Yes.

02:40.733 --> 02:41.733
Because I'm your guru?

02:42.860 --> 02:43.883
Sure.

02:45.042 --> 02:46.621
Say it.
Say that 'Eskild is my guru.'

02:48.629 --> 02:49.439
Fuck this.

02:49.464 --> 02:50.228
Say it! 'Eskild...'

02:50.253 --> 02:51.546
No. No, just forget about it.

02:51.571 --> 02:54.141
Fine, fine, fine. Fine, Isak. Okay.

02:54.546 --> 02:55.546
What...

02:55.768 --> 02:56.894
What is it you're wondering?

03:03.782 --> 03:04.806
You...

03:05.584 --> 03:06.743
You know that guy, Even?

03:07.140 --> 03:08.354
Yup. What about him?

03:11.977 --> 03:13.874
Nah, we had a thing, you know...

03:16.073 --> 03:18.358
And he said that he would
break up with his girlfriend.

03:21.403 --> 03:22.434
And then suddenly

03:22.736 --> 03:25.180
He says that things happened too fast

03:25.205 --> 03:25.855
And...

03:26.196 --> 03:27.918
Then he's back together
with his girlfriend.

03:28.522 --> 03:29.601
And then...

03:31.177 --> 03:33.725
And then a while after that
he gives me this drawing.

03:35.129 --> 03:36.989
And I'm thinking, "Okay, cool," and I send

03:37.014 --> 03:38.915
him a message thanking him for the drawing.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.828
But then he doesn't answer...

03:45.786 --> 03:47.270
But he has a girlfriend?

03:49.040 --> 03:50.040
Yeah.

03:54.377 --> 03:56.099
Okay. For how long have they been together?

03:57.901 --> 03:59.671
For about four years.

04:03.060 --> 04:04.060
Okay?

04:05.209 --> 04:06.455
That's not good, or?

04:08.654 --> 04:11.082
I mean, yeah. Or, I don't know, how...

04:11.646 --> 04:13.320
How honest would you like me to be?

04:15.815 --> 04:17.395
Not too honest, maybe.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.768
No, you know what, fuck it.
Just say it like it is.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.720
Yeah, I mean. I...

04:25.179 --> 04:26.703
I mean, I know a lot of...

04:26.980 --> 04:28.346
Guys in heterosexual relationships

04:28.371 --> 04:29.989
Who sleep with guys.

04:30.014 --> 04:32.013
That's pretty normal, but...

04:34.371 --> 04:37.847
Not a lot of guys leave their
girlfriends to be together...

04:45.637 --> 04:47.479
I think... Or, I mean...

04:47.677 --> 04:48.677
It's...

04:51.344 --> 04:54.804
Or they might, I mean it's just my advice.
That's just my opinion.

04:54.974 --> 04:57.911
My... My guru-advising.

04:58.157 --> 04:59.657
Kinda. And I'm not Buddha.

05:00.371 --> 05:01.371
Or...

05:02.014 --> 05:05.220
I'm not God. Kinda, or...

05:06.093 --> 05:07.379
So...

05:09.649 --> 05:10.649
Was that helpful?

05:16.272 --> 05:18.106
Okay, Sana.

05:18.216 --> 05:21.209
What is excretion? Task fifteen.

05:22.188 --> 05:24.593
A, excretion of nitrogenous waste.

05:24.680 --> 05:27.665
B, excretion of carbon dioxide.

05:27.839 --> 05:30.831
C, excretion of excess
matters in the body, or...

05:30.927 --> 05:34.196
D, excretion of wastes.
Yes, it's that one!

05:35.038 --> 05:36.347
I read it last week.

05:36.372 --> 05:37.538
What, D?

05:37.855 --> 05:39.030
No, no, no. It's A.

05:41.552 --> 05:42.552
A?

05:43.179 --> 05:44.179
No!

05:44.465 --> 05:45.251
It's A?

05:45.370 --> 05:46.394
Where did you get D from?

05:46.419 --> 05:48.606
Nitrogenous waste?
We haven't read about that.

05:48.631 --> 05:49.433
Nitrogenous waste...

05:49.458 --> 05:53.085
Well, we definitely haven't read about
excretion of waste from their organs.

05:53.110 --> 05:54.276
That doesn't even make sense.

05:54.339 --> 05:57.387
What do you mean, it doesn't make sense?
This is what we've covered in class.

05:57.412 --> 06:00.180
Organs don't excrete waste?

06:01.751 --> 06:02.505
Why not?

06:02.530 --> 06:05.228
Anyway, it's not A.
That has nothing to do with anything.

06:05.253 --> 06:05.918
Nitrogen?

06:05.943 --> 06:07.664
Don't joke around with me right now.
It's A.

06:08.839 --> 06:11.561
Jesus Christ.
Why are we having this discussion?

06:12.315 --> 06:15.530
Just... Just trust me, Sana.

06:15.887 --> 06:18.149
I trust myself, and it's A.

06:18.522 --> 06:20.855
Like, this is my subject.
I know what I'm doing.

06:20.958 --> 06:21.934
It's my subject as well.

06:21.959 --> 06:23.665
Can you just circle A? It is A!

06:26.759 --> 06:27.838
Let's just Google it.

06:29.084 --> 06:31.116
I'm not being bothered
by your stubbornness.

06:31.441 --> 06:33.965
If you're so insecure that you
have to Google it, go ahead.

06:33.990 --> 06:36.187
But I know that I'm right,
and I know that it's A.

06:36.538 --> 06:38.577
I'm not insecure,
I know that I'm right as well.

06:39.323 --> 06:41.133
But I'm not going to answer A on it.

06:41.712 --> 06:43.958
So... Yeah. What are we going to do?

06:44.823 --> 06:45.823
Hello?

06:46.550 --> 06:47.550
Excuse me?

06:47.836 --> 06:48.526
Yes, Sana?

06:48.621 --> 06:50.566
What do we do if we
can't agree on an answer?

06:50.629 --> 06:52.748
Then you'll circle both alternatives.

06:53.050 --> 06:56.026
And then write your names next to
the one you think is the correct one.

06:56.744 --> 06:57.871
Easy.

06:58.712 --> 07:00.736
D, Isak.

07:04.069 --> 07:05.919
A, what's your name again?

07:13.304 --> 07:15.129
What's the next question?

07:15.844 --> 07:16.844
How does...

07:17.566 --> 07:19.955
The transportation take place in animals...

07:20.823 --> 07:22.506
Without a circulatory system?

07:24.617 --> 07:28.339
Can all duos please write their
names at the top of their paper?

07:28.466 --> 07:29.561
I'll do it.

07:40.542 --> 07:44.629
(I hope you don't find this question to
be rude, but is it true that you're gay?)

07:45.593 --> 07:47.839
(Where did you hear that?)

07:55.480 --> 08:00.886
(It was just somebody saying that you and
that Even guy from third year had a thing?)

08:01.076 --> 08:03.513
(Who said it?)

08:06.979 --> 08:12.193
(Someone in first year who'd heard it
from Emma who knows his girlfriend.)

08:17.157 --> 08:20.093
(Sorry if it's not true.)

08:20.196 --> 08:22.903
(But it's really cool if you are.)

08:22.982 --> 08:25.331
(I love gays!)

08:28.092 --> 08:31.505
Where IKEA get all of the
names for their furniture from.

08:31.632 --> 08:35.354
If they, like, just go to a Swedish
name registry and take some from there?

08:35.379 --> 08:36.379
Hi, Isak.

08:37.465 --> 08:38.465
Who is she?

08:39.461 --> 08:40.461
I don't know.

08:46.128 --> 08:47.866
Hey, what's up?

08:50.180 --> 08:51.180
'Sup?

08:52.046 --> 08:53.046
What's this?

08:55.419 --> 08:57.149
I think that guy's found his song.

08:57.174 --> 08:58.927
I have. Fuck, it's so nice.

09:03.669 --> 09:04.471
Ey, what's up?

09:04.510 --> 09:05.828
Nah, not much.

09:06.106 --> 09:08.661
Isak said he'll be hosting
a pre-drink on Friday.

09:10.085 --> 09:12.419
I am with you, man. I'm in!

09:12.609 --> 09:13.609
You'll join, right?

09:13.665 --> 09:14.910
Yeah. Yeah, of course we're in.

09:15.593 --> 09:18.268
I'm not going to get violent again.

09:18.347 --> 09:19.601
Okay, that's chill.

09:19.807 --> 09:23.871
Oh! Did you hear the rumor that you guys
fought at Emma's party because Isak is gay?

09:24.014 --> 09:24.815
What? No?

09:25.014 --> 09:27.125
Yup. It's hilarious! Haven't you heard?

09:27.608 --> 09:29.013
What did you say we fought about?

09:29.068 --> 09:30.068
That he's gay.

09:31.155 --> 09:32.822
Yeah, why would we fight about that?

09:33.163 --> 09:34.814
You were a Muslim.
I don't fucking know.

09:35.528 --> 09:36.719
I'm not even a Muslim?

09:37.148 --> 09:39.362
I know, it's fucking hilarious!

09:40.514 --> 09:44.561
Is it hilarious that the entire school
thinks I'm a homophobe?

09:44.586 --> 09:46.831
Homophobe?
(Magnus making fun of Mahdi's pronunciation.)

09:46.856 --> 09:47.752
Homophobe.

09:47.777 --> 09:48.641
Yeah, but...

09:48.666 --> 09:51.029
Yeah, okay. But that's not hilarious...
Like, is that funny?

09:51.054 --> 09:54.133
No... But it's hilarious that
people think that Isak is gay!

09:54.235 --> 09:56.084
You did tell them that it's bullshit?

09:56.132 --> 09:59.220
I said they should watch out, 'cause you
would 'jihad' the entire school, bro.

10:02.637 --> 10:06.598
Just kidding. I told them Isak
was going to a family dinner.

10:07.304 --> 10:08.359
That you fought because...

10:08.479 --> 10:09.836
We didn't even fight?!

10:09.963 --> 10:11.915
Relax, man. It's okay.
It's only a rumor, okay?

10:12.169 --> 10:13.169
Chill.

10:25.314 --> 10:26.639
Uh, guys...

10:28.068 --> 10:29.600
Do you remember...

10:29.625 --> 10:31.869
Do you remember when we were
watching those girls dance?

10:31.894 --> 10:35.671
Bro, every time I close my eyes
the only thing I see are those girls.

10:35.784 --> 10:37.077
Fuck, they were hot.

10:38.577 --> 10:40.022
Yeah, but do you remember...

10:41.720 --> 10:44.506
That a guy came up to us?

10:45.387 --> 10:46.387
That gay guy?

10:47.419 --> 10:48.649
Why do you think he's gay?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.204
You're the one who said he was gay?

10:52.990 --> 10:56.530
No, no! Not him, not him. I'm talking about
the other guy who came over.

10:58.165 --> 10:59.165
Yeah, maybe...?

11:00.624 --> 11:02.163
The guy who...

11:03.243 --> 11:06.830
The guy who said I'd forgotten
my hat in the cafeteria.

11:08.933 --> 11:10.362
Yeah, I think I remember him.

11:10.815 --> 11:11.815
Yeah.

11:12.315 --> 11:13.315
What about him?

11:19.204 --> 11:20.411
We've had a thing.

11:25.066 --> 11:26.066
A thing?

11:27.312 --> 11:28.312
A thing.

11:30.494 --> 11:31.581
The fuck, are you gay?

11:32.053 --> 11:33.188
I'm not gay.

11:33.879 --> 11:35.553
Well, maybe I'm a little gay, but

11:36.022 --> 11:38.498
It's not as though... Yeah.

11:38.887 --> 11:40.744
I'm not keen on you guys, for example.

11:40.769 --> 11:43.339
It's not as though I'm keen on
all guys all the time.

11:45.431 --> 11:47.288
But... You hook up with
chicks every weekend?

11:48.637 --> 11:51.209
Yeah, but maybe he's pansexual.

11:51.383 --> 11:52.177
What's pansexual?

11:52.344 --> 11:53.637
It's when you like both.

11:54.137 --> 11:55.193
That's bisexual?

11:55.641 --> 11:56.847
Yeah. I think that's bisexual.

11:57.196 --> 11:59.482
Yeah, but like, pansexual is
also that you like both.

11:59.997 --> 12:02.847
What the fuck is the difference
between pansexual and bisexual?

12:02.872 --> 12:03.895
There's no difference.

12:03.950 --> 12:07.300
Well, anyway... Pansexual,
bisexual, gay or not.

12:07.498 --> 12:09.038
He's said he'll host on Friday.

12:09.863 --> 12:10.863
Sweet.

12:10.990 --> 12:13.958
Maybe we'll get some chicks for once,
seeing as you suddenly became a fag.

12:15.585 --> 12:17.442
Doesn't mean you've got
any more game, though.

12:17.871 --> 12:18.871
Huh?

12:45.307 --> 12:47.289
(1: Hi Even. Thanks for the drawing.
It was nice.

12:47.314 --> 12:49.430
When did you actually manage
to put it in my jacket?)

12:49.455 --> 12:51.476
(2: Meanwhile, in another universe:
Glad you liked

12:51.501 --> 12:53.323
it. Put it there when you had P.E.
Miss you.)

13:21.244 --> 13:22.394
You don't get in the mood.

13:22.419 --> 13:25.648
No, you don't... Because, like,
there are ten people in a huge apartment

13:25.673 --> 13:27.823
And then they play 'Russ' music
to get the mood going.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.093
'Russ' music is fucking pumped!

13:29.118 --> 13:30.640
When you don't get in the mood and so

13:30.665 --> 13:32.466
you're like,
"Let's put on some 'Russ' music."

13:32.491 --> 13:33.934
They do that at the parties I go to.

13:33.959 --> 13:35.196
The girls go crazy!

13:35.490 --> 13:37.997
But it's so often that it
doesn't fit to play 'Russ'

13:38.022 --> 13:40.251
music where they play
'Russ' music, all the time.

13:40.276 --> 13:40.911
You get that, right?

13:40.936 --> 13:43.419
Yeah, okay. Fine.
So what do you wanna listen to then?

13:43.601 --> 13:45.973
I don't know, but if I go
to parties I'm keen on

13:45.998 --> 13:48.562
listening to some old-school
hip hop, some 90's shit.

13:48.587 --> 13:49.141
Nate Dogg.

13:49.427 --> 13:50.887
Yeah, Nate Dogg!

13:51.132 --> 13:52.393
He's sick.

13:52.418 --> 13:53.418
Who's Nate Dogg?

13:53.489 --> 13:54.426
Who's Nate Dogg?

13:54.451 --> 13:55.641
Man, are you serious?

13:55.666 --> 13:56.871
I haven't heard of Nate Dogg.

13:57.013 --> 13:58.379
Uh, do you know who Snoop Dogg is?

13:58.759 --> 13:59.815
I know who Snoop Dogg is!

13:59.848 --> 14:00.848
What's up, man?

14:01.871 --> 14:03.490
Nothing, I guess.

14:05.647 --> 14:06.647
Nothing?

14:08.092 --> 14:10.425
Anything new with that guy Even, or what?

14:11.330 --> 14:12.330
No.

14:12.973 --> 14:14.528
Well, I got a new drawing.

14:16.752 --> 14:17.942
A new draw...

14:18.292 --> 14:19.998
What's his deal?

14:20.887 --> 14:22.196
I don't know. He's...

14:22.927 --> 14:24.498
Yeah, all over the place.

14:24.696 --> 14:25.783
What are you talking about?

14:28.514 --> 14:29.736
Are you talking about Even?

14:32.028 --> 14:34.004
What's going on between
the two of you, really?

14:34.695 --> 14:35.782
There's nothing going on...

14:36.552 --> 14:37.552
He's got a girlfriend.

14:39.489 --> 14:40.640
Oh, he's pansexual as well?

14:42.093 --> 14:43.093
I don't know.

14:43.490 --> 14:44.522
Just one thing...

14:45.077 --> 14:49.212
I've been thinking about something,
sorry if it's rude, but...

14:49.728 --> 14:50.950
Gays, when they have sex...

14:51.736 --> 14:53.903
Who's the man and who's the woman?

14:54.791 --> 14:55.958
- Dude...
- What?!

14:56.085 --> 14:56.728
What?

14:56.767 --> 14:58.573
Funny you should ask,
because I was going to

14:58.598 --> 15:00.403
ask you the same thing
for when you have sex.

15:00.449 --> 15:01.822
Who's the man and who's the woman?

15:03.767 --> 15:05.568
But then I remembered
that you don't have sex!

15:06.020 --> 15:07.020
Holy fuck.

15:07.584 --> 15:09.314
Wow. Where did that come from?

15:09.552 --> 15:10.806
That's a stab in the heart.

15:10.831 --> 15:12.472
It wasn't that bad of a question, was it?

15:14.862 --> 15:16.791
I was just seriously wondering, but okay...

15:16.919 --> 15:19.038
Okay, okay. But honestly...

15:19.323 --> 15:22.609
I feel like you're letting
him play you, kinda.

15:23.577 --> 15:24.577
Play me?

15:24.696 --> 15:27.172
That like, he keeps you going.

15:27.268 --> 15:28.379
And then nothing happens.

15:28.680 --> 15:30.291
And he's still together with that chick.

15:32.522 --> 15:33.522
Yeah.

15:33.608 --> 15:35.322
But I can't control what he does.

15:35.458 --> 15:38.220
Yes, you can!
If you're like...

15:39.165 --> 15:40.927
Completely straight-up,
send him a text and

15:40.952 --> 15:42.553
say, "Hey dude, stop
what you're doing!"

15:43.728 --> 15:45.871
"Yo dude, stop what you're doing!"?

15:45.997 --> 15:48.402
- Yeah. Or, maybe not that, but...
- Nah, that's not like me.

15:48.784 --> 15:50.228
No, but like...

15:50.974 --> 15:52.673
Okay, "Text me..."

15:53.093 --> 15:56.022
"Stop texting me. Call me when you've
broken up with your girlfriend."

15:57.657 --> 15:58.657
Straight-up.

15:59.038 --> 15:59.967
That's what works.

15:59.992 --> 16:03.347
And if he's interested, he's gonna get
stressed out. We've all been there.

16:03.372 --> 16:04.514
Yeah, exactly!

16:04.736 --> 16:09.665
Like, if you're fooling around with a girl,
or you're just keen on hooking up with her

16:09.690 --> 16:12.887
But you're not keen on
being in a relationship with her

16:12.912 --> 16:14.712
But like, she texts you,

16:14.910 --> 16:19.752
"What's up? Let's meet, I'm tired of
you not taking this seriously."

16:19.839 --> 16:21.363
Then you become serious right away.

16:21.388 --> 16:23.657
Yeah! And you get really shocked.

16:23.682 --> 16:27.244
Yeah, you get shocked.
And you don't fuck with her after that.

16:27.269 --> 16:29.513
It's worse when she doesn't
answer you when you text her.

16:29.538 --> 16:30.895
When it says like,
(Hi, thanks for the drawing, but if...)

16:30.919 --> 16:32.864
That they've seen your text like, an hour ago.
(you're not interested in something...)

16:32.888 --> 16:37.420
Yeah, but only sneaky people do that. (more, you can just let
it be. Call me when you've broken up with your girlfriend.)

16:37.444 --> 16:39.133
Girls do it all the time with me.

16:39.530 --> 16:40.530
Like, girls?

16:42.164 --> 16:45.593
Maybe you should start hitting
on a different kind of girl.

16:46.220 --> 16:47.998
I'm hitting on the best there is, though.

16:48.165 --> 16:49.165
I did it.

16:49.696 --> 16:50.696
I sent the text.

16:50.879 --> 16:51.879
No way?!

16:52.665 --> 16:53.903
That's not too bad.

16:55.387 --> 16:56.776
Cheers!

16:58.283 --> 16:58.751
Brothers.

16:58.895 --> 17:00.188
That really surprised me.

17:05.006 --> 17:05.553
Is it him?

17:05.578 --> 17:06.672
(What are you doing now?)

17:06.697 --> 17:07.743
He answered.
(Can we talk?)

17:08.688 --> 17:10.331
"What are you doing now?
Can we talk?"

17:10.776 --> 17:11.776
Seriously?

17:12.903 --> 17:13.903
What should I reply?

17:14.053 --> 17:14.609
Call him.

17:14.744 --> 17:16.514
No, don't call him.

17:16.815 --> 17:18.871
Write, uh... "Chilling at home."

17:19.300 --> 17:20.069
"Chilling at home"?

17:20.094 --> 17:21.442
Yeah, that's good. That's good.

17:23.955 --> 17:26.248
"Chilling at home."

17:29.637 --> 17:30.637
"Just call."

17:30.831 --> 17:34.696
No! You want him to call, but like...

17:35.228 --> 17:39.974
You have to write it as though you...
don't want that? You get me?

17:40.125 --> 17:42.323
So just write "chilling at home", and done.

17:42.348 --> 17:43.267
"Chilling at home."

17:43.292 --> 17:44.307
"Chilling at home", okay.

17:45.276 --> 17:47.665
"Chilling at home", smiley?

17:47.720 --> 17:48.736
No!

17:48.863 --> 17:50.180
"Chilling at home", done.

17:50.474 --> 17:51.474
No feelings.

17:51.593 --> 17:52.077
Okay.

17:52.102 --> 17:53.180
Completely... straight-up.

17:53.315 --> 17:54.038
Chilling at home.

17:54.077 --> 17:55.077
Yeah.

17:56.704 --> 17:57.188
Sent.

17:57.379 --> 17:58.379
He's going to call.

18:26.640 --> 18:27.958
Check if there's a...

18:28.672 --> 18:30.053
Bubble. If he's writing something.

18:36.925 --> 18:38.615
No bubble.

18:39.504 --> 18:41.655
He's not going to answer.
That's just the way he is.

18:42.800 --> 18:46.252
Maybe he's at a place where he's,
like, unable to talk right now.

18:49.990 --> 18:50.990
Maybe...

19:02.233 --> 19:03.557
The beer didn't taste good today.

19:03.792 --> 19:04.815
What are you drinking?

19:04.918 --> 19:06.418
Tuborg. In a bottle.

19:07.355 --> 19:09.458
It tasted like plastic, or something.

19:10.125 --> 19:13.061
Is it... Has there been
too much yeast, or what?

19:13.427 --> 19:14.053
Probably...

19:14.315 --> 19:15.315
Oh, fuck!

19:15.617 --> 19:17.411
Yeah. Yo, yeast...!

19:17.514 --> 19:20.632
This person I know, knows someone...

19:23.236 --> 19:29.077
And he told me that someone had put
yeast inside a carton of apple juice

19:29.156 --> 19:31.625
and put it in his locker at school,
to make beer...?

19:31.650 --> 19:32.212
At school?

19:32.237 --> 19:33.220
Yeah?! Isn't that weird.

19:33.245 --> 19:33.632
Huh?

19:33.736 --> 19:35.497
It must have stunk
like shit in that school.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.807
That's what they said.
It smelled like shit!

19:37.832 --> 19:39.355
He probably wanted to party at school.

19:41.942 --> 19:45.077
What the fuck, it must be completely...
Do you know him?

19:45.268 --> 19:45.879
No.

19:45.903 --> 19:47.869
- It's a friend of a friend, like he said.
- Yeah.

19:48.379 --> 19:50.188
But... But, uh...

19:51.220 --> 19:53.212
What's up?
Did you invite someone?

19:53.442 --> 19:56.339
No. You're the only friends I've got.

19:56.712 --> 20:00.807
It's probably Eskild. He forgets his
keys every fucking day.

20:03.212 --> 20:04.212
It's Even.

20:04.657 --> 20:06.109
- Huh?
- It's Even?

20:06.157 --> 20:07.300
Seriously? He's here?

20:07.371 --> 20:08.918
I'm not fucking around, it's Even.

20:09.013 --> 20:10.546
Is it Even? Let's meet Even, you guys!

20:10.571 --> 20:12.093
- Yeah. Yeah, we gotta do that.
- Yeah.

20:12.118 --> 20:12.680
No!

20:13.101 --> 20:14.022
Why can't we meet Even?

20:14.047 --> 20:15.887
Seriously, I'm not fucking around.
Out, out, out, out, out, out!

20:15.911 --> 20:16.831
Why can't we meet Even?

20:16.856 --> 20:17.728
Where are we supposed to go?

20:17.753 --> 20:19.436
You can't meet Even, what
are you talking about?

20:19.460 --> 20:20.806
Do you have my phone?!
I can't find it!

20:20.830 --> 20:22.411
Your phone?! Why would
I have your phone?!

20:22.435 --> 20:23.887
Yeah, but where are we supposed to go?

20:23.911 --> 20:26.394
Have the pre-drinks outside then,
you do have a party to go to!

20:26.419 --> 20:27.776
It's fucking freezing!

20:28.236 --> 20:29.474
Remember the alcohol!

20:29.499 --> 20:32.673
No, you're going to bump into him.
You'll go out the back door!

20:33.038 --> 20:35.680
The shoes are on the other...
I'll get your shoes, fine!

20:39.077 --> 20:40.077
Shoes?

20:40.505 --> 20:40.964
Shoes?

20:40.989 --> 20:42.663
Isak, I need the shoes now, buddy!

20:42.922 --> 20:44.478
Get them, for fucks sake!

20:47.961 --> 20:48.930
Yeah, yeah. That's fine.

20:48.955 --> 20:50.414
They're not even my shoes!

20:51.665 --> 20:53.380
You... You put on my shoe!

20:53.538 --> 20:56.117
Come on, guys! The most important
thing is that we're leaving!

21:13.744 --> 21:14.744
Hey.

21:15.450 --> 21:16.450
Hey.
