00:12.011 --> 00:13.430
[distant traffic throbs]

00:18.226 --> 00:20.437
[pulsing sound]

00:22.439 --> 00:23.440
Helix.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.483
SandStorm.

00:25.567 --> 00:26.609
Prove it.

00:45.503 --> 00:46.337
Did you bring it?

00:47.630 --> 00:48.798
Did you bring it?

00:52.302 --> 00:53.720
[Trevor] Keep it cool and dry.

00:58.266 --> 01:00.477
We shouldn't contact each other
on the forums anymore.

01:00.560 --> 01:01.644
Kill the trail here.

01:06.066 --> 01:06.900
[soft beep]

01:06.983 --> 01:08.193
He's taken care of.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.153
-Copy.
-[SandStorm]  Thanks.

01:13.031 --> 01:14.532
You know how to handle that?

01:16.284 --> 01:19.120
I-it's safe to walk around with, right?

01:19.204 --> 01:21.289
Stable. Wouldn't call it safe.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.458
What does that mean?

01:23.541 --> 01:26.461
That means don't drop it,
don't shake it,

01:26.544 --> 01:28.213
don't expose it to heat,
don't get it wet.

01:28.296 --> 01:29.506
I know what I'm doing, asshole.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.257
-She's pleasant.
-[Trevor]  I can tell.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.884
Reminds me of your girlfriend.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.386
This is what I asked you to build, right?

01:35.470 --> 01:36.971
I did a lot of research.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.849
To your exact specifications.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.476
Then we're good.

01:43.019 --> 01:45.063
Long as you don't take it
through a metal detector.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.731
[Marcy]  Trevor, don't scare her away.

01:46.815 --> 01:47.982
Why do you care?

01:49.192 --> 01:50.652
Because I made it.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.946
You do something stupid

01:53.029 --> 01:55.448
and blow yourself up
trying to get through security...

01:55.532 --> 01:56.366
[Philip]  Easy.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.826
...might come back on me.

01:59.661 --> 02:01.121
You don't have to worry about that.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.417
-[Trevor]  I should go after her.
-Don't do it.

02:06.501 --> 02:08.837
Marcy's right.
We don't want to push her too hard.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.338
I'm not trying to push her at all,

02:10.421 --> 02:12.674
but that's the mission that
the Director assigned us.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.386
[Philip]  Just have to try again.

02:25.353 --> 02:26.479
Agent MacLaren.

02:26.563 --> 02:29.941
Congressman Bishop.
We meet again.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.651
You met my host.

02:31.734 --> 02:35.071
We never actually met,
because you improvised.

02:35.155 --> 02:36.906
Almost got yourself killed in the process,

02:36.990 --> 02:39.409
and left me stranded
waiting for another team.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.494
Gee, I'm sorry for the inconvenience.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.413
There was an extenuating circumstance.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.206
[Bishop] Always is with you.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.334
I'm amazed you're assigned
any missions at all, let alone this one.

02:49.586 --> 02:50.420
This one?

02:50.503 --> 02:53.131
Well, I'm assuming it's
not just to drive you around.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.888
Your mission is to perform
an assassination.

03:00.889 --> 03:01.723
Of who?

03:04.017 --> 03:04.976
Me.

03:51.105 --> 03:51.940
Hi, Chloe.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.858
It's your boyfriend!

03:58.071 --> 03:59.906
Babysitting my little sister today.

03:59.989 --> 04:01.574
Do you want to play Space Kabob?

04:01.658 --> 04:03.284
He's not your boyfriend, he's mine.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.078
You can play, though,
if you don't tell Mom.

04:08.623 --> 04:09.958
Wanna play something else?

04:10.041 --> 04:12.835
I can't stay. I just came for some drops.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.421
Mmm, you're burning
through 'em fast. [chuckles]

04:15.505 --> 04:16.506
We are.

04:17.048 --> 04:18.007
That's fair.

04:19.008 --> 04:20.510
Maybe we can play a little.

04:47.704 --> 04:50.331
[telephone rings]

04:51.416 --> 04:53.626
Hi, this is David. Leave a message.

05:02.927 --> 05:03.761
[sighs]

05:24.907 --> 05:25.992
[Kat] It's open.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.580
[MacLaren] Hey.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.249
Hey, hey, leave that.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.959
[Kat] I'm no stranger to moving furniture.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.962
Yeah, I know,
but you shouldn't be overdoing it.

05:39.464 --> 05:43.259
Part of my deal with Nicole is
to redecorate this place while she's gone,

05:43.342 --> 05:46.554
which looks like it could be a while,
by the way.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.474
She's loving it in London,
so, yay.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.560
You really like it here, huh?
This space?

05:53.144 --> 05:57.899
Are you kidding? It's the kind of place
I fantasized about living in,

05:57.982 --> 05:59.609
till I met you.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.403
You don't think I'd go
for something like this?

06:02.487 --> 06:04.864
[chuckles] No.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.532
Huh.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.870
There's a unit for sale
in this building.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.872
Let's put in an offer.

06:12.955 --> 06:14.665
-[Kat scoffs]
-I'm serious.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.088
But you love our old house.

06:20.171 --> 06:21.798
It's a house.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.467
Without you living there,
it's an empty house.

06:24.550 --> 06:26.010
I say we downsize.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.807
With the baby coming,
I need more space, not less.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.310
Ohh. Come here.

06:37.188 --> 06:38.314
Can you feel that?

06:40.608 --> 06:42.235
I can't believe we're doing this.

06:45.154 --> 06:45.988
What?

06:47.406 --> 06:48.449
You said "we."

06:50.743 --> 06:51.994
I got all excited.

06:52.078 --> 06:54.247
I'm not ready for you to move in, Grant.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.583
Well, a house doesn't get sold in a day.

06:58.418 --> 07:00.753
And we're leaving the other one
behind either way, right?

07:02.505 --> 07:05.133
Just... thinking about the future.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.596
-Just...
-[MacLaren huffs]

07:14.016 --> 07:15.643
Maybe I should have gone after her.

07:15.726 --> 07:18.312
[Philip] She comes to this cafe
almost every day just after ten.

07:20.022 --> 07:22.483
Okay, she's coming down Bellwood.
She's close.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.989
She stopped just outside.

07:30.366 --> 07:31.534
[Trevor] Copy.

07:39.709 --> 07:41.419
[Trevor speaking indistinctly]

07:45.006 --> 07:46.257
What are you doing here?

07:47.675 --> 07:49.594
-Huh?
-Are you following me?

07:50.553 --> 07:53.514
[chuckles] How?
I've been here for two hours.

07:54.223 --> 07:56.267
-Are you following me?
-No.

07:57.268 --> 07:58.519
That's my spot.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.896
I was here first.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.023
Sit there.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.609
-Whatever.
-Whatever.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.083
Can I help you... SandStorm?

08:23.711 --> 08:25.796
Sounds so stupid
when you say it out loud.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.798
Yeah, it does.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.177
I'm Trevor.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.428
Abby.

08:34.680 --> 08:35.973
Galston Agriculture fan?

08:36.057 --> 08:38.226
Mnh-mnh. Not a fan, definitely.

08:38.309 --> 08:39.143
Why?

08:39.227 --> 08:40.686
They stomp out the competition,

08:40.770 --> 08:42.605
they stall unions,
file nuisance claims,

08:42.688 --> 08:44.690
fund anti-environmental lobbyists.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.276
Other than that,
they're model corporate citizens.

08:47.360 --> 08:49.654
Okay, it's way worse than that.

08:54.992 --> 08:56.202
Look at the bottom.

08:56.285 --> 08:58.287
[Trevor reading] "Seed C589,

08:58.371 --> 09:01.874
scheduled for limited release
and production.

09:01.958 --> 09:04.460
Patent pending." That's all it says.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.630
It's an experimental crop that's able
to extract more nutrients from the soil

09:07.713 --> 09:10.716
in order to yield a larger harvest
by 20 to 30 percent.

09:11.551 --> 09:12.969
What's wrong with that?

09:13.052 --> 09:14.845
It's never been tested in the field.

09:14.929 --> 09:17.348
They don't know the limits
of how many nutrients

09:17.431 --> 09:19.433
C589 will pull from the soil.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.519
It's not about sustainability.
It's about profit,

09:21.602 --> 09:24.438
and for the sake of a few years
of record harvests,

09:24.522 --> 09:27.567
this crop can decimate
all the farmland that it grows in.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.570
A famine isn't just some biblical event.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.738
No, I know, it happens.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.450
They already have a prototype strain
ready to go.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.660
When?

09:37.743 --> 09:38.953
This week.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.540
Well, it would have to pass
FDA regulations.

09:43.124 --> 09:46.627
Not if Bill 939 gets passed,
which allows corporations

09:46.711 --> 09:49.213
to bypass the regulatory process
for standard testing.

09:51.632 --> 09:54.260
They want to get it to market
ahead of the competition.

09:54.343 --> 09:55.886
How do you know all this?

09:59.599 --> 10:00.600
Not here.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.311
[door unlocks]

10:04.895 --> 10:05.896
Jeff?

10:07.607 --> 10:08.816
Anyone home?

10:18.242 --> 10:20.077
[Abby] I was excited when I got
the internship.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.455
I thought I could take 'em down
from the inside, you know?

10:22.538 --> 10:24.540
I wrote to our Congress.
I wrote to our senator.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.126
I sent reports to the FDA
of their violations.

10:27.209 --> 10:29.837
I even tried blackmailing one
of their private investors.

10:29.920 --> 10:30.755
You go, girl.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.256
[chuckles]

10:32.340 --> 10:34.175
You did not just say that.

10:34.258 --> 10:37.928
Uh, anyway, I just got moved
from the labs down to the basement,

10:38.012 --> 10:40.973
so all I do now is archive
old paperwork.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.558
So, I'm not waiting around anymore.

10:42.642 --> 10:43.976
What does that mean?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.686
I still have access to the building,

10:45.770 --> 10:47.772
and I have what I need
to do something about it.

10:47.855 --> 10:50.232
That's some serious shit
you're talking, Abby.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.027
It's also a big job for one person.

10:53.861 --> 10:55.071
I can do it.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.490
You don't think I can do it?

10:58.074 --> 10:59.575
You're not hearing me.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.373
[TV announcer]  And while House
and Senate Democrats

11:05.456 --> 11:07.375
are deeply divided on the bill,

11:07.458 --> 11:11.379
Congressman Ted Bishop
has taken a hard stand against it,

11:11.462 --> 11:12.713
vowing to fight it.

11:12.797 --> 11:16.175
[Bishop on TV]  We are gonna stop Bill 939.
We are gonna get the Senate to hear us,

11:16.258 --> 11:19.261
and we will strike down
this destructive bill.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.097
And we will succeed.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.434
This is it.

11:27.561 --> 11:29.397
[Abby chuckles] Whoa.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.440
Holy shit.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.359
Place is...

11:33.442 --> 11:34.652
-Hey.
-[Philip] Hello.

11:34.735 --> 11:37.530
Abby, Philip-- my hacker friend
I was telling you about.

11:37.613 --> 11:38.906
Oh, what'd he say?

11:39.740 --> 11:43.452
Uh, you're the best, I can trust you,
and you want to help.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.745
There's so much more to me.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.375
-You guys live here?
-Mi casa.

11:49.458 --> 11:52.670
I still have a room
at my parents' house, but I'm here a lot.

11:52.753 --> 11:53.796
[Abby] Just the two of you?

11:53.879 --> 11:55.047
And Poppy.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.467
His pet turtle.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.304
You know they can carry
salmonella bacteria, right?

12:03.389 --> 12:04.974
-Noted.
-[Trevor] Okay.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.435
Our system is completely secure,

12:07.518 --> 12:09.562
so go ahead and plug in.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.900
No shame in a little porn.
I won't judge.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.652
Rule 34.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.737
She's hilarious. Where'd you find her?

12:18.821 --> 12:19.655
She found me.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.955
These are the project work files
on C589 I managed to swipe.

12:28.038 --> 12:30.875
I've gone through some of it,
but a lot of it's encrypted.

12:30.958 --> 12:33.002
What's the timeline we're working on here?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.588
The Bill 939 vote is tomorrow.

12:35.671 --> 12:37.298
Galston won't waste time.

12:39.133 --> 12:41.594
The labs are always empty between
eleven and one for lunch.

12:42.595 --> 12:43.554
That's our window.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.682
[Dr. Higgins]
Well, the heartbeat sounds good.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.686
The kidney, liver, brain,
all developing very well.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.522
This is just what we want to see
at this stage.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.817
Now, there was one area
of concern that we saw,

12:56.901 --> 13:00.863
this, uh, dark spot here,
just behind the placenta.

13:00.946 --> 13:01.780
What is it?

13:01.864 --> 13:03.908
Uh, too early to say for sure,

13:03.991 --> 13:07.620
but we would be concerned
if it were a blood clot.

13:07.703 --> 13:10.539
Have you experienced any spotting,

13:10.623 --> 13:12.249
any contractions recently?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.710
-No.
-What would a clot mean?

13:14.794 --> 13:18.130
It could be the early signs
of a placental abruption.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.633
But it could be nothing.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.134
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.137
There's no need for either of you
to worry at this time.

13:25.221 --> 13:27.389
But given your age and your history,
we're gonna--

13:27.473 --> 13:29.433
we're gonna keep a close eye on this.

13:30.309 --> 13:32.520
So, best to make an appointment
with my office,

13:32.603 --> 13:34.230
come back and see me in two weeks.

13:34.313 --> 13:35.147
Okay?

13:39.693 --> 13:41.987
The-the doctor said
it might not be anything.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.198
I know what the doctor said,

13:44.281 --> 13:45.908
and I've been through this before.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.535
That's not gonna happen this time.

13:47.618 --> 13:49.662
That's not in your power.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.829
Oh, shit!

13:52.039 --> 13:53.290
I left my phone in there.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.376
Wait for me in the car.
I'll be two minutes.

14:02.591 --> 14:03.592
Thank you.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.804
[whispers] Marcy.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.515
You got a minute? I didn't want
to have this conversation over comm.

14:09.598 --> 14:10.641
What?

14:10.724 --> 14:12.184
I need a favor.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.102
Yeah, of course.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.395
One that breaks protocol.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.981
I need you to understand,
this happened the night

14:17.064 --> 14:19.525
we were all
under the effect of the antitoxin...

14:20.276 --> 14:21.569
which you don't remember.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.487
We briefed you on the Helios mission.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.698
This was the night after.
We were all affected.

14:26.490 --> 14:27.408
Okay.

14:27.491 --> 14:30.119
Well, my wife had helped arrange
a surprise party for me,

14:30.202 --> 14:32.621
and I didn't realize the effect
the drug was having.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.540
I consumed too much alcohol.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.041
You broke protocol four.

14:38.294 --> 14:42.089
And that puts her at, what...
20 weeks?

14:42.172 --> 14:43.173
Something like that.

14:43.257 --> 14:44.341
But this is not her fault.

14:44.425 --> 14:45.801
No, it isn't. It's yours.

14:45.885 --> 14:46.719
-I know.
-What were you thinking?

14:46.802 --> 14:49.430
I... wasn't, obviously.

14:51.307 --> 14:54.226
All right, it'll probably still be best
if you took her to a clinic.

14:54.310 --> 14:55.769
Procedure's safe, even at this stage.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.229
She's going through with it.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.731
It's her decision to make.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.233
-Well, talk her out of it.
-I'm not gonna do that.

15:02.651 --> 15:05.279
No, we... we just came
from the ultrasound.

15:05.362 --> 15:07.531
There's a problem.
It's a placental abruption.

15:07.615 --> 15:08.449
Yeah.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.285
That's serious in any century.

15:11.368 --> 15:16.665
Yeah, but you could improve her odds
of carrying the baby to term, right?

15:16.749 --> 15:19.376
There's a drug I could
technically synthesize, yes,

15:19.460 --> 15:21.211
but you know that I can't do that.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.213
I'm asking you to think about it.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.427
I need to get back to work.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.473
-Hey, Marcy.
-Dr. Barker.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.558
Uh, so is he your, uh...

15:35.935 --> 15:36.936
My boyfriend?

15:37.019 --> 15:37.853
No.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.355
Excuse me.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.440
Would you like to go to dinner sometime?

15:43.984 --> 15:45.819
Sure. When?

15:45.903 --> 15:48.489
How about-- how about this weekend?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.367
How about now?
I just gotta go change.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.035
Oh...

15:55.162 --> 15:56.205
Okay, then.

16:05.589 --> 16:07.424
I'll be giving my speech from here.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.303
Yeah, that's a decent vantage point.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.389
From which to shoot me?

16:14.223 --> 16:15.474
That's why we're here.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.937
I was told there'll be a distraction
at 11:27 a.m.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.271
[MacLaren] We're aware of that.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.649
It's blocks away,
but the sound should carry.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.361
Why don't you check out your spot?

16:30.197 --> 16:31.198
You all right?

16:32.408 --> 16:34.034
This is plan "B."

16:34.118 --> 16:37.538
My original mission from the Director
was a little more long-term.

16:37.621 --> 16:40.499
Rise in the ranks of government,
maybe high office.

16:40.582 --> 16:44.461
Unfortunately, my host has a heart
condition the Director wasn't aware of.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.964
You've still done great things
as a congressman

16:47.047 --> 16:48.674
that your host wouldn't have done.

16:48.757 --> 16:50.467
Been paying attention, have you?

16:50.551 --> 16:52.678
Felt I had a vested interest.

16:52.761 --> 16:55.973
The Director has fattened me up
like a lamb being led to the slaughter.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.308
All I've done in the short time
I've been here

16:58.392 --> 17:00.102
is set myself up to become a martyr!

17:00.185 --> 17:01.770
We all have our part in the grand plan.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.439
Yeah, yeah, it is what it is.

17:07.026 --> 17:10.821
Oh, I want to ask,
that woman in the stasis field--

17:10.904 --> 17:13.032
what was she to you,
worth risking your life for?

17:15.451 --> 17:18.579
Someone I care about that was not
supposed to be on the plane that day.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.789
She made it?

17:22.041 --> 17:23.584
Yeah, she did.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.878
Well, that makes one of us.

17:29.256 --> 17:30.799
[Bishop huffs]

17:30.883 --> 17:32.217
It'll be quick, right?

17:40.517 --> 17:42.227
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

17:43.270 --> 17:44.271
Uh...

17:45.355 --> 17:46.190
to courage.

17:46.273 --> 17:47.107
Courage.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.615
[Dr. Barker sighs]

17:54.698 --> 17:58.827
So, what drew you to health care?

17:58.911 --> 18:01.538
God, that is an awful question
to lead with.

18:01.622 --> 18:03.457
I am so sorry.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.542
No, it-- it's fine.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.627
No, it's, uh...

18:09.922 --> 18:12.966
I... don't know what it is about you.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.177
You're so...

18:17.721 --> 18:20.307
At some point, I'm going to need you
to finish that sentence.

18:21.141 --> 18:24.103
Every male in the hospital would be
jealous of me if they knew where I was.

18:25.020 --> 18:26.605
This must be a really good restaurant.

18:26.688 --> 18:28.899
[chuckles] I mean...

18:28.982 --> 18:31.401
with you, obviously.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.157
Ah, well, I-I got into health care

18:37.241 --> 18:40.869
because in the future,
it's gonna be more important than ever.

18:40.953 --> 18:41.787
I know.

18:41.870 --> 18:45.541
I mean, we're just on the cusp
of so many amazing things.

18:45.624 --> 18:49.128
Mmm. Why'd you become a doctor?

18:49.711 --> 18:51.046
Um...

18:51.130 --> 18:53.006
Similar reasons to you, really.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.926
I want to be part of the changes
that are coming.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.011
I mean, think-think of
what we're able to do now

18:58.095 --> 19:01.223
that we couldn't even ten,
fifteen years ago--

19:01.306 --> 19:04.143
you know, brain mapping,
stem cell research,

19:04.226 --> 19:06.103
robotically assisted surgeries,

19:06.186 --> 19:08.313
limitless ways to help people.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.691
I mean, isn't that what it's all about?

19:12.985 --> 19:15.362
You have a very positive view
of the future.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.738
Yeah, don't you?

19:18.365 --> 19:19.199
I do.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.583
Here you go.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.501
Thanks.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.711
What are you writing?

19:30.794 --> 19:32.921
It's like a mission statement.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.882
I want people to know
why we're doing this.

19:34.965 --> 19:38.093
You don't think that bombing
a research lab makes a statement?

19:38.177 --> 19:40.596
I don't want people to think
that I'm some radical.

19:40.679 --> 19:43.015
-There's a point to this.
-That's why we're helping you.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.227
I been doing some reading.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.062
C589 is worse than you think.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.230
How?

19:50.314 --> 19:53.233
There are properties in the mutation
of the seed that are monophyletic.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.985
Mono what?

19:56.236 --> 19:59.031
Means that the organisms descend
from the same common ancestor,

19:59.114 --> 20:00.407
in this case the kudzu,

20:00.490 --> 20:02.868
a weed known for completely
taking over a territory.

20:02.951 --> 20:05.412
So, if farmers start using C589...

20:05.495 --> 20:07.331
Not only will it deplete
the soil of nutrients,

20:07.414 --> 20:09.124
it will spread... rapidly.

20:09.208 --> 20:12.211
With its genetic resistance to pesticides,

20:12.753 --> 20:14.963
C589 could become impossible
to contain.

20:15.547 --> 20:16.381
[Philip] He's right.

20:17.382 --> 20:20.219
All arable land on the planet
could be choked out in decades.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.597
You guys really know your shit.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.934
I don't really have a life
outside the Internet.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.644
And I'm getting an "A" in biology.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.251
[sighs]

22:13.415 --> 22:14.624
No, thank you.

22:14.708 --> 22:15.542
Nuh-unh.

22:16.543 --> 22:21.256
I spent many years very, very close
to an old person

22:21.340 --> 22:23.175
who had to fight
for every breath he took.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.262
Trying to ruin this for me?

22:27.345 --> 22:29.973
Nah. You're an intelligent person.

22:30.974 --> 22:32.684
You can make your own decisions.

22:38.607 --> 22:42.235
[Abby grunts, chuckles]

22:44.905 --> 22:46.531
So, what do we do now?

22:48.366 --> 22:49.701
We can look at the stars.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.705
Nah, there's too much light pollution.

22:53.789 --> 22:55.499
I can only see one.

22:56.333 --> 22:57.334
Sirius.

22:58.376 --> 22:59.211
Oh.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.172
There-there's another one.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.009
That's Mars. It's a planet.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.386
I defer to your astronomy expertise.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.807
Astrology, unfortunately.

23:12.808 --> 23:13.809
My mom was into it.

23:14.810 --> 23:18.438
She based all her decisions,
all her relationships on bullshit,

23:18.522 --> 23:21.149
like whether Jupiter and Mars
were aligned.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.735
-[both chuckle]
-[Abby] Ugh.

23:23.819 --> 23:26.947
Most belief systems
are just a shared vocabulary

23:27.030 --> 23:28.323
for people in search of meaning.

23:29.825 --> 23:33.078
I think maybe the important thing
is to just believe in something.

23:34.496 --> 23:36.123
You mean something spiritual.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.207
Something.

23:39.709 --> 23:41.128
I don't believe in anything.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.212
Yeah, you do.

23:44.089 --> 23:45.298
You believe in humanity.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.468
You believe that our future's at stake.

23:50.887 --> 23:52.347
That's not spiritual.

23:52.430 --> 23:53.765
Yeah, it is.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.354
[both chuckle]

23:59.437 --> 24:01.857
God! Who are you?

24:01.940 --> 24:03.358
[light chuckle]

24:03.441 --> 24:05.861
I mean, where were you
when I was in high school?

24:05.944 --> 24:09.364
Would have been nice to have at least
one interesting person to talk to.

24:10.448 --> 24:11.867
Well, I'm kind of an old soul.

24:13.660 --> 24:14.870
Yeah, no kidding.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.042
I like it.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.215
I, uh...

24:27.299 --> 24:30.051
I should get back in there
and see if Phil...

24:30.135 --> 24:31.386
Yeah.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.680
...see if Philip needs help finishing up.

24:33.763 --> 24:34.598
So...

24:34.681 --> 24:37.100
Don't light up while I'm gone.

24:37.184 --> 24:38.393
[Abby chuckles softly]

24:43.481 --> 24:45.025
[sighs]

24:48.904 --> 24:50.322
[door closes]

24:54.326 --> 24:55.327
[Philip] Good to go.

24:58.914 --> 25:00.665
You remember when Hall said,

25:00.749 --> 25:03.543
"Don't think the future
doesn't get its hands dirty"?

25:10.342 --> 25:11.551
I know how you feel.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.347
But we knew going into this

25:15.430 --> 25:17.474
that there's some parts of history
we can't change.

25:20.727 --> 25:22.562
Some people still have to die.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.442
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

25:34.908 --> 25:37.494
-[woman] We will not be shut down!
-[applause]

25:37.577 --> 25:40.413
[group chanting]
Just say no to 939!

25:40.497 --> 25:43.333
Say yes to our futures!

25:43.416 --> 25:44.668
[MacLaren] Morning, Congressman.

25:45.502 --> 25:46.336
MacLaren.

25:47.629 --> 25:48.838
Not much of a turnout.

25:48.922 --> 25:51.341
It's more important the event's covered
by the news outlets,

25:51.424 --> 25:52.259
and they're all here.

25:53.176 --> 25:55.720
-You know, for what it's worth--
-It's worth nothing.

25:55.804 --> 26:01.142
It's a life, thrown away on the vague hope
that one man's death can turn a tide.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.186
I wish I'd never volunteered.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.479
But here I am.

26:04.562 --> 26:06.439
You are going through with this?

26:07.774 --> 26:11.194
Don't worry, I'll play my part,
however pathetic it might be.

26:11.778 --> 26:14.489
Then again, you might just
change the world.

26:14.572 --> 26:16.491
I know the Director believes that.

26:30.588 --> 26:31.589
Five minutes.

26:35.218 --> 26:36.136
Bishop's ready.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.391
I'm in position.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.726
[Marcy]  Me too. All set.

26:42.809 --> 26:46.104
[chanting continues]

26:53.820 --> 26:56.281
Device is set for 11:27,

26:56.364 --> 26:58.491
so when you have it in place here
on the second floor--

26:58.575 --> 27:01.202
I flip the engagement switch
and get the hell out of the building.

27:01.286 --> 27:02.329
You got it.

27:02.412 --> 27:03.621
All right.

27:05.832 --> 27:07.625
Okay. Here we go.

27:14.841 --> 27:16.176
You good?

27:16.259 --> 27:17.093
Yeah.

27:18.636 --> 27:19.471
Yeah.

27:21.639 --> 27:22.474
I should go.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.478
So, we'll, uh,
be right here the whole time.

27:28.646 --> 27:29.647
See you soon.

27:58.259 --> 28:00.470
[applause]

28:03.139 --> 28:05.892
[man shouting]

28:11.648 --> 28:14.192
[applause]

28:14.275 --> 28:15.402
Thank you.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.487
Thank you all for coming.

28:19.823 --> 28:23.535
We are gathered here
at a defining moment

28:23.618 --> 28:25.370
in the history of our country.

28:26.871 --> 28:30.291
Today, the Senate will vote
on Bill 939...

28:31.709 --> 28:36.005
which at its core, institutes provisions

28:36.089 --> 28:41.761
that seeks to diminish
corporate environmental accountability.

28:41.845 --> 28:44.180
[crowd booing]

28:49.561 --> 28:50.979
[device beeping]

28:56.276 --> 28:57.110
[device beeping]

28:59.988 --> 29:02.490
[guard]
Let's have a look in the briefcase.

29:02.574 --> 29:04.242
Could you open it for me, please.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.330
And, as your Congressman,
I stand here as

29:09.414 --> 29:11.750
a comrade in arms,

29:11.833 --> 29:16.254
ready to fight against
irresponsible policies

29:16.337 --> 29:17.839
brought forth to the Senate

29:17.922 --> 29:21.217
that seek to place short-term profits

29:21.301 --> 29:24.596
ahead of the health and well-being

29:24.679 --> 29:25.889
of our planet.

29:31.436 --> 29:34.522
[distorted speech]

29:41.780 --> 29:43.198
[device beeps]

29:57.545 --> 29:59.214
I don't like it, either.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.264
I can't do it.

30:08.348 --> 30:09.182
What?

30:09.265 --> 30:11.351
I changed my mind.
This isn't what I want.

30:11.434 --> 30:12.268
Let's go.

30:12.352 --> 30:14.562
No, no, no, you need to trust the plan.

30:14.646 --> 30:17.440
I don't. I'm not doing it.
I don't know what I was thinking.

30:17.524 --> 30:18.358
Abby.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.694
Abby, it's got to be done.

30:21.778 --> 30:22.779
Fuck that!

30:22.862 --> 30:23.696
What's changed?

30:23.780 --> 30:24.989
You.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.700
Okay, it's you guys.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.954
I mean, you've completely
opened my eyes to a possible--

30:31.037 --> 30:32.455
[flat intonation]
Traveler 0115...

30:32.539 --> 30:33.581
Oh, no, no!

30:33.665 --> 30:36.668
...complete the mission in place
of Abigail Paris immediately.

30:38.962 --> 30:39.921
Oh, shit.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.218
Help me.

30:49.264 --> 30:52.308
-Why would the Director do this?
-Because she was supposed to die.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.188
-What are you doing?
-Protocol one.

30:59.482 --> 31:00.316
Bye.

31:03.152 --> 31:03.987
Trevor!

31:05.154 --> 31:06.573
Boss, we have a problem.

31:06.656 --> 31:07.490
What?

31:07.574 --> 31:09.617
We have less than a minute,
and the bomb's gonna blow.

31:10.660 --> 31:12.370
We're in position. What's the problem?

31:12.453 --> 31:14.038
Trevor's the one taking it in.

31:14.622 --> 31:15.540
[MacLaren]  What?

31:15.623 --> 31:17.792
[sighs] Goddamn it.

31:18.626 --> 31:20.253
[MacLaren]
Trevor, what are you doing?

31:20.336 --> 31:21.713
[Trevor] Abby went messenger.

31:21.796 --> 31:24.757
Traveler 0115, complete the mission,
that's what it said.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.342
[Philip] Who cares what it said!

31:26.426 --> 31:27.886
We'll find another way.

31:29.137 --> 31:29.971
Trevor!

31:31.055 --> 31:32.891
-[device beeps]
-[Philip]  Trevor!

31:34.809 --> 31:35.643
Trevor!

31:39.314 --> 31:41.900
We're down to seconds!
We don't have time!

31:41.983 --> 31:43.318
[Trevor] That's enough.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.445
Both missions depend on this happening.

31:48.531 --> 31:49.741
So long, guys.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.745
[Philip]
Boss, help me out here!

31:53.828 --> 31:55.163
Trevor, you know what to do.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.040
What?! No!

32:13.222 --> 32:14.265
Come on!

32:23.399 --> 32:25.234
[panting]

32:42.168 --> 32:48.383
This... is a unique time
in human history.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.678
Humanity is at a tipping point.

32:51.761 --> 32:54.597
This is a time when people
of the future will ask,

32:54.681 --> 32:57.767
"Did you act,
or did you stand idly by?"

32:57.850 --> 32:59.268
Where's the diversion?

32:59.352 --> 33:00.561
Stand by.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.896
Trevor, it's time.

33:06.401 --> 33:07.944
Boss, it won't detonate.

33:10.697 --> 33:14.409
[Bishop] Where were you when it was
us or them?

33:14.492 --> 33:16.619
Because we must protect...

33:19.622 --> 33:20.790
He's having a heart attack.

33:20.873 --> 33:21.874
Call it now.

33:22.583 --> 33:23.584
He's dying anyway.

33:26.212 --> 33:27.046
We...

33:28.840 --> 33:32.260
must protect humanity's future...

33:33.428 --> 33:37.056
regardless of our political beliefs...

33:37.640 --> 33:40.435
regardless of our religion...

33:41.436 --> 33:43.021
the color of our skin...

33:44.564 --> 33:48.443
regardless of personal cost.

33:48.526 --> 33:51.320
[cheering]

33:58.870 --> 34:01.080
He won't die a martyr
if he has a heart attack.

34:01.164 --> 34:02.165
This is the whole point.

34:02.248 --> 34:03.249
He won't make it out.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.960
I got your back. Take the shot.

34:06.044 --> 34:07.879
[Bishop] And now is the time for--

34:07.962 --> 34:08.796
[gunshot]

34:08.880 --> 34:10.298
[crowd screaming]

34:11.466 --> 34:14.010
There! Over there, I saw the shooter!

34:14.093 --> 34:16.262
[crowd screaming]

34:41.245 --> 34:42.330
Get in.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.418
Keep your head down.

34:57.428 --> 34:58.513
[MacLaren] Stand back!

34:59.722 --> 35:00.932
Make some room!

35:06.938 --> 35:08.564
[security agent] He's gone.

35:12.527 --> 35:16.239
[Philip panting]

35:32.964 --> 35:34.590
What took you so long?

35:34.674 --> 35:38.094
We, uh, we had to take care of
Abby's body before we came back.

35:40.179 --> 35:41.389
So, what went wrong?

35:41.472 --> 35:43.599
It was deactivated remotely.

35:43.683 --> 35:44.517
[Philip] By me.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.145
What?

35:47.728 --> 35:49.564
I wasn't gonna let him die for nothing.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.481
Like Abby.

35:50.565 --> 35:53.985
It wasn't for nothing, or we wouldn't
have been given the mission.

35:54.068 --> 35:56.696
Galston's competition is weeks away
from their own prototype.

35:56.779 --> 35:59.073
And come on, people.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.784
Ted Bishop's assassination isn't going
to inspire a movement.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.452
That's not for you to decide.

36:03.536 --> 36:05.371
Well, I did. And it's done.

36:05.454 --> 36:08.457
We could easily have lost
one team member to save another.

36:08.541 --> 36:11.919
Without that diversion, Carly was
completely exposed after she fired.

36:12.003 --> 36:14.088
-You hung me out to dry.
-And I see you made it.

36:14.172 --> 36:17.008
That's not the point, Philip!
You undermined a direct order!

36:17.091 --> 36:18.718
Like the order the Director gave you?

36:20.386 --> 36:23.389
'Cause if memory serves--
and, hey, it usually does...

36:24.390 --> 36:27.852
you were given an explicit order,
"Kill 3468."

36:27.935 --> 36:30.062
But, hey, maybe she just
hasn't gotten around to it.

36:30.146 --> 36:31.564
This isn't funny.

36:31.647 --> 36:33.191
You look me in the eye and tell me

36:33.274 --> 36:35.651
I am the only one on this team
who has improvised.

36:36.736 --> 36:37.737
Tell me.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.199
I am the only one
that's broken the rules.

36:53.169 --> 36:55.671
I can hack into Galston

36:55.755 --> 36:58.257
and wipe all their data on C589.

36:59.675 --> 37:01.719
And we can even get
another bomb in there.

37:03.596 --> 37:05.681
But there are other ways to do this.

37:05.765 --> 37:09.477
And if we get that mission,
then that's what we'll do.

37:11.437 --> 37:14.649
It's out of our hands now.
Protocol five until further notice.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.567
I should add,

37:16.651 --> 37:19.737
despite my apparent
protestations to the contrary...

37:21.072 --> 37:23.032
I'm very glad you're still alive.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.492
Thank you.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.618
You too.

37:28.788 --> 37:29.830
Mac.

37:31.791 --> 37:33.793
Give me one of her folic acid pills.

37:35.253 --> 37:38.965
If we're going to swap one medication
to prevent a miscarriage,

37:39.048 --> 37:40.549
they'll need to look identical.

37:40.633 --> 37:42.969
[whispering]
I-I didn't think you were gonna do this.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.972
I'm a doctor. I help people.

37:46.055 --> 37:48.140
I took that oath first.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.476
You know, technically that's not--

37:50.559 --> 37:52.937
Okay, then. I'm improvising.

37:54.772 --> 37:55.940
Thank you.

38:00.486 --> 38:01.612
[Marcy] Hey.

38:01.696 --> 38:03.197
Can I get a ride?

38:03.281 --> 38:04.365
Sure.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.658
Van's out front.

38:06.492 --> 38:07.827
Where to?

38:07.910 --> 38:10.997
Honestly, I don't really feel
like going home.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.542
I know just where that is.

38:15.501 --> 38:16.335
Come on.

38:30.016 --> 38:31.017
Kat?

38:38.733 --> 38:39.942
Kat, you home?

39:59.980 --> 40:01.524
[keyboard clacking]

40:21.794 --> 40:24.130
Hey, perfect timing.
I was just thinking about you.

40:28.634 --> 40:29.677
You okay?

40:32.430 --> 40:33.264
Yeah.

40:34.265 --> 40:35.099
Long day.

40:37.643 --> 40:38.894
[Jenny] Come on.

40:39.728 --> 40:42.148
We'll be in my room.
Answer the phone if Mom calls.

40:44.066 --> 40:45.693
-Chloe!
-Okay!

41:12.887 --> 41:13.971
[Jenny sighs]

41:16.098 --> 41:17.600
[Jenny chuckles softly]

41:19.310 --> 41:20.144
Ready?

41:24.982 --> 41:26.400
[Jenny chuckles softly]

42:04.063 --> 42:06.148
[Marcy] How did you even find this place?

42:07.149 --> 42:10.402
[Carly] They're turning this old
government building into condos soon.

42:10.486 --> 42:12.446
Jeff brought me here
to look at the view.

42:12.530 --> 42:13.364
[Marcy] Hmm.

42:13.447 --> 42:15.282
[Carly]
Wants to buy one.

42:15.366 --> 42:19.078
[Marcy] Seems like this address
might be a little out of your price range.

42:19.161 --> 42:22.665
Everything he likes is a little out
of our price range.

42:22.748 --> 42:24.416
Likes to dream, that man.

42:24.500 --> 42:27.002
So... you two.

42:27.086 --> 42:28.295
We three.

42:29.296 --> 42:32.007
The child is why we're doing this.
That's the only reason.

42:32.091 --> 42:32.925
Is it?

42:34.552 --> 42:35.761
He did stop drinking.

42:37.930 --> 42:39.723
I got a zero tolerance thing going.

42:40.724 --> 42:42.184
We both love that boy, so...

42:42.268 --> 42:46.605
Hmm. I met a guy.

42:47.940 --> 42:48.857
You did?

42:49.692 --> 42:50.609
Doctor.

42:51.610 --> 42:53.487
Well, at least you have
something in common.

42:53.571 --> 42:56.490
I don't know. I don't really think
there's anything there.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.617
[explosion in distance]

43:00.786 --> 43:02.413
Galston Agriculture's that way.

43:02.496 --> 43:03.330
Trevor.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.334
Trevor, where are you?

43:07.418 --> 43:08.919
Come in!

43:09.003 --> 43:09.837
Trevor!

43:09.920 --> 43:12.881
[Trevor]  Sorry, I was visiting
my parents. Couldn't talk.

43:12.965 --> 43:14.300
You guys see that?

43:14.383 --> 43:16.844
Yeah, we saw it. Had to be Galston.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.055
Someone just completed our mission.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.065
[flat intonation] Traveler 3326,

43:30.149 --> 43:34.737
open memory chain 71985VX
and store the following sequence:

43:34.820 --> 43:40.034
Biosynthesis of the glycoproteins
IgE, IgM, IgD, IgA, IgG.

43:40.117 --> 43:43.537
Cleave HA protein to form
HA-1, HA-2,

43:43.621 --> 43:45.831
and fuse with BHK 21-F.

43:45.914 --> 43:49.793
Ribonucleic acid compounds mRNA...
