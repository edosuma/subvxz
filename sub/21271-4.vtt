WEBVTT

00:04.520 --> 00:06.240
Who the fuck are you?

00:06.360 --> 00:07.360
Is this your daughter?

00:07.480 --> 00:09.680
Because she has
trashed my house.

00:09.800 --> 00:10.920
I beg your bloody pardon?

00:11.040 --> 00:12.720
Rita told us to
send a message.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.040
And you are banned
from my dairy.

00:14.160 --> 00:15.600
I'm sure we'll meet again.

00:15.720 --> 00:19.080
You couldn't [inaudible]everything that I own,

00:19.200 --> 00:20.640
all of my house, never
to be seen again.

00:20.760 --> 00:21.880
It was me.
It was all my idea.

00:22.000 --> 00:22.760
Bullshit.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.240
It was your mom.

00:24.360 --> 00:25.400
You're doing it for me.

00:29.520 --> 00:30.920
God, where have you been?

00:31.040 --> 00:31.880
Fuck off.

00:32.000 --> 00:32.920
So [inaudible]?

00:33.040 --> 00:34.400
You need to get away from her.

00:34.520 --> 00:35.760
She's toxic.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.480
This is all down to you
and you fucking know it.

00:42.320 --> 00:43.920
REPORTER: In a statement
released later,

00:44.040 --> 00:46.600
the British foreignsecretary, Lord Carrington,

00:46.720 --> 00:49.680
described the raising of theArgentine flag on South Georgia

00:49.800 --> 00:52.960
as an act that
could lead to war.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.000
At the high court inOakland today, Belinda Lace,

former wife of deceasedOakland businessman, Evan Lace,

00:59.600 --> 01:02.360

the charge of murder.

01:02.480 --> 01:04.520
She has been remanded
in custody, pending

01:04.640 --> 01:06.640
a psychiatric evaluation.

01:06.760 --> 01:07.520
Lace was found--

01:18.400 --> 01:20.440
You know she's as madas a [inaudible],, right?

01:20.560 --> 01:21.840
No need to talk
about it, love.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.280
Righto, then.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.160
Well, enjoy the
fish and chips, boys.

01:29.280 --> 01:31.000
Because there's no [inaudible]for food after this.

01:31.120 --> 01:32.000
Do we have any butter sauce?

01:34.240 --> 01:35.000
Gah!

01:35.120 --> 01:35.920
No.

01:36.040 --> 01:38.960
Ah, not a-bloody-gain.

01:39.080 --> 01:41.000
Ah, what the fuck is this?

01:41.120 --> 01:42.680
Looks like next doorcaptain is shitting in here.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.640
A heart, a
still-beating heart.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.360
No, that's not still beating.

01:46.480 --> 01:47.840
Well, not now that
you stood on it.

01:50.640 --> 01:52.720
[singing]

01:52.840 --> 01:55.480
Hey, I'm in here.
I'm in here.

01:55.600 --> 01:57.760
And for the third time, Idon't want people taking number

01:57.880 --> 02:00.640
two's while I'm showering.

02:00.760 --> 02:02.320
Ah.
- It's got to be Evan.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.480
There's no other suspects.

02:03.600 --> 02:04.720
Except for the
entire neighborhood

02:04.840 --> 02:07.280
we pissed off when we moved in.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.840
Oh, God.

02:08.960 --> 02:10.000
I told you.

02:10.120 --> 02:11.840
It's a ghost that's
messing with us.

02:11.960 --> 02:12.960
And we all know which ghost.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.880
I know what it's
like, love, when you

02:33.000 --> 02:36.080
feel responsible for something.

02:36.200 --> 02:40.240
When Doogle died,
it was you know.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.520
But in the end, you've gotto remind yourself that--

02:42.640 --> 02:45.120
Ted.

02:45.240 --> 02:49.960
When your time's up,it's bloody up, you know?

02:50.080 --> 02:52.880
Ted.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.320
OK.

02:55.440 --> 02:58.400
One good thing about
having an empty nest--

02:58.520 --> 03:00.880
You weren't attached tothat gravy boat, were you?

03:01.000 --> 03:03.320
Fuck the gravy boat.

03:03.440 --> 03:09.240
[music playing]

03:48.080 --> 03:49.600
Can I sleep in here?

03:49.720 --> 03:51.080
Why?

03:51.200 --> 03:54.720
The Evan ghost is
scratching at my window.

03:54.840 --> 03:56.800
It's just a tree, you dick.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.520
[voices whispering]

04:12.080 --> 04:14.960
[door creaking]

04:53.800 --> 04:56.560
I met the ghost last night.

04:56.680 --> 05:00.080
It visited me in my bed.

05:00.200 --> 05:02.800
Did it hurt you?

05:02.920 --> 05:05.680
No, it's a friendly ghost.

05:05.800 --> 05:07.200
Like Casper?

05:07.320 --> 05:08.640
Not quite like Casper.

05:08.760 --> 05:10.800
Did Evan speak to you?

05:10.920 --> 05:12.080
What is his message?

05:12.200 --> 05:14.720
He, uh--

05:14.840 --> 05:15.800
What did he do to you, Sparky?

05:18.480 --> 05:22.520
He gave me a blow job.

05:22.640 --> 05:24.360
- The ghost of it Evan Lace?- Sucked you off.

05:24.480 --> 05:25.360
It was intense.

05:25.480 --> 05:27.680
It was magical.

05:27.800 --> 05:30.000
For fuck's sake, it'scalled the wet dream, Sparky.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.120
Next time, keep it to yourself.

05:31.240 --> 05:32.800
Was Evan gay
when he was alive?

05:32.920 --> 05:34.360
There is no ghost.

05:34.480 --> 05:35.240
Evan's gone.

05:35.360 --> 05:36.200
He's dead.

05:36.320 --> 05:37.360
He's in the fucking ground.

05:37.480 --> 05:38.200
That's what happens
when you die.

05:38.320 --> 05:39.360
They put you in a hole.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.880
They put fucking soil on you.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.840
Great, the milk's off.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.320
No, I snagged this yesterday.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.200
That's Evan.

05:47.320 --> 05:48.120
He's curdled the milk.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.560
Ah, man.

05:49.680 --> 05:52.880
Yeah, yeah, I don't wantno ghost giving me head.

05:53.000 --> 05:53.760
Not a male ghost, anyway.

05:53.880 --> 05:54.680
Ah, come on.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.880
This is bullshit.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.560
He knew-- he knew
we stole from him.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.320
He never had the chance
to punish us in life.

06:00.440 --> 06:01.640
So he is punishing us in--

06:01.760 --> 06:03.160
Shut the fuck up.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.840
Come on, Wolfy.

06:04.960 --> 06:07.120
I'm sure your mom wouldlove to have you back home.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.640
Suit yourself.

06:08.760 --> 06:10.760
But I don't believe
in the heebie-jeebies.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.000
But I do, in both the
heebie and the jeebie.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.160
If you stay, I'll stay.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.400
You're a dick, Sparky.

06:26.600 --> 06:28.280
- What are you doing here?- Morning tea?

06:28.400 --> 06:29.680
No, you have to leave.

06:29.800 --> 06:30.680
It's not a big deal.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.200
I felt like seeing my lady love.

06:32.320 --> 06:33.520
Don't.

06:33.640 --> 06:34.960
If Rita sees you in
here snooping around--

06:35.080 --> 06:37.160
I'm here to have acustard square with my lady,

06:37.280 --> 06:39.080
and a cup of tea if
she'd put the kettle on.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.920
You wouldn't expect meto waltz into the station

06:41.040 --> 06:42.080
asking for cups of tea.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.040
Well, I wouldn't mind.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.000
Well, I do mind.

06:44.120 --> 06:45.120
It's a lovely gesture.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.440
But I'll see you later, Mike.

06:48.560 --> 06:49.360
Morning, Rita.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.120
Mike was just leaving.

06:51.240 --> 06:52.800
Is he going to
buy something first?

06:52.920 --> 06:55.040
You know how to make abloke feel unwelcome, ladies.

06:55.160 --> 06:55.960
See you later, Mike.

06:56.080 --> 06:56.880
Take your custard squares.

06:57.000 --> 06:57.840
You have them.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.480
My gift to your [inaudible].

07:02.920 --> 07:06.240
- How's the boy?
- Sorry.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.000
Well, sort of a
traumatic experience

07:08.120 --> 07:10.000
for you both the other night.

07:10.120 --> 07:14.560
I meant to ask, was he
still on Evan's payroll?

07:14.680 --> 07:16.440
Just some of the things we'reuncovering about Mr. Lace,

07:16.560 --> 07:18.000
whew.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.880
Not a bloke I'd want anyson of mine involved with.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.680
Well, given he's dead, that'snot really a problem, it it?

07:23.800 --> 07:26.880
Mike, get out.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.440
Just making
conversation, love.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.320
You don't come in here andthrow your weight around.

07:30.440 --> 07:31.240
Leave.

07:35.280 --> 07:36.040
Just as well.

07:36.160 --> 07:37.280
Love her to bits, eh?

07:42.680 --> 07:46.720
Thing about my wife isshe calls a spade a spade,

07:46.840 --> 07:48.080
you know?

07:48.200 --> 07:50.000
She doesn't like you,
she'll bloody tell you.

07:50.120 --> 07:51.840
Or smack you in the
head with an oven trey.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.440
Yeah, see?

07:53.560 --> 07:55.880
You know where you
stand with Rita.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.760
When she goes quiet like this,it's when you got to worry.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.560
Well, that's when you'vegot to take cover, by God.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.600
Because--
- You want me to help?

08:02.720 --> 08:05.040
Well, not that I can't
handle my own wife.

08:05.160 --> 08:06.320
Of course.

08:06.440 --> 08:09.120
But um, well maybe
it's a woman thing.

08:09.240 --> 08:10.520
Yuck.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.480
He doesn't mean she's
got the [inaudible]..

08:13.600 --> 08:15.680
He just means it's
time for a girl talk.

08:15.800 --> 08:16.960
Yes, Ted?

08:17.080 --> 08:17.840
If you wouldn't mind.

08:24.720 --> 08:25.800
REPORTER: Hello, Mrs. Rita.

08:25.920 --> 08:27.080
G'day.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.000
What's all this.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.320
We are refugees.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.400
We're in need of a home.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.280
Is that so?

08:33.400 --> 08:36.120
The house in
Ponsonby, it's so cold.

08:36.240 --> 08:37.560
There's no food.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.640
And we are being hauntedby the ghost of Evan Lace.

08:39.760 --> 08:41.760
Yeah, there's been allsorts of shenanigans, not

08:41.880 --> 08:45.320
a good kind, either,
the scary haunty kind.

08:45.440 --> 08:46.600
Like the kind
where you've spent

08:46.720 --> 08:47.760
too much time on the bong.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.200
No, there's none
of that anymore.

08:50.320 --> 08:53.520
So please, can we come home?

08:53.640 --> 08:55.280
All of you?

08:55.400 --> 08:57.000
No, the others
are sticking it out.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.200
All right.

09:02.320 --> 09:03.120
Come on.

09:07.520 --> 09:08.360
Hey, love.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.880
Hi.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.200
Put your stuff downstairs, boys.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.920
They're all back, are they?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.280
Just those two.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.320
Yeah, yeah, why don't
you have a seat, love?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.560
I'll-- I'll fix you drink.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.920
So Rita, I hear
you're a bit down.

09:24.040 --> 09:25.360
Do you?

09:25.480 --> 09:27.000
About, you know, thewhole Evan Lace business.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.320
I'm fine, Carol.

09:28.440 --> 09:30.000
I just need a stiff
gin and tonic is all.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.000
On its way, love.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.440
Must have been nasty, though.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.680
Seeing a man die like thatright in front of you.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.920
Yeah, like when Doogle gothis head blown off, eh, Ted?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.120
Hmm?

09:38.240 --> 09:40.040
Doogle, his head,
brains everywhere.

09:40.160 --> 09:40.920
[inaudible]

09:41.040 --> 09:42.120
I'm just saying.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.560
At least your guy
only got stabbed.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.240
Then how is it supposedto help Rita feel better?

09:46.360 --> 09:47.880
I'm not some kind
of delicate flower

09:48.000 --> 09:49.080
if that's what
you're worried about.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.520
You live, you.

09:50.640 --> 09:53.360
Die It's not as if hewas a decent human being.

09:53.480 --> 09:54.960
Better make those boys some tea.

10:03.080 --> 10:05.080
I'll go to bed then.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.080
Whatever you want, Sparky.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.680
Can I sleep in your
room again tonight?

10:10.800 --> 10:12.560
Did you change your
sheets after last night?

10:12.680 --> 10:13.640
No.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.400
Then it's all yours.

10:16.520 --> 10:19.560
Happy wet dreams.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.480
It was real, wolf.

10:28.560 --> 10:32.960
[ominous music playing]

10:54.120 --> 10:54.920
See ya, mate.

10:55.040 --> 10:56.400
You're welcome.

10:56.520 --> 11:01.400
[music continues]

12:27.760 --> 12:28.520
Oh, my god.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.080
Oh, my god.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.280
Oh, my god.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.120
Jesus Christ, Janet.

12:34.240 --> 12:36.440
You fucking bastard.

12:36.560 --> 12:37.920
Fuck you, Wolfgang West.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.080
You did that on purpose.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.040
Huh?

12:40.160 --> 12:41.680
Well, you put Sparky there.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.200
Because you knew.

12:43.320 --> 12:44.720
You knew.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.280
What that you were goingto sneak in and root him?

12:46.400 --> 12:47.800
What the fuck, Janette?

12:47.920 --> 12:49.680
I thought it was one of thewackos from the boarding

12:49.800 --> 12:50.680
houses around here.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.000
But you, the blood on the wall?

12:53.120 --> 12:53.920
Did you kill something?

12:54.040 --> 12:55.400
Of course not.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.080
I got the blood and stufffrom the butcher down

12:57.200 --> 12:58.440
the road from the dairy, OK?

13:03.840 --> 13:08.400
It's funny, you've got to admit.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.360
Get out of my house.

13:10.480 --> 13:13.240
So last night wasn't
a ghost blow job.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.520
It was you?

13:15.640 --> 13:17.560
Get out.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.160
Yes, it was.

13:19.280 --> 13:21.080
And I spat it in
the milk afterwards.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.360
Oh, that would
explain the taste.

13:22.480 --> 13:23.720
Don't you touch me.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.280
Get your fucking hands off me.

13:26.400 --> 13:27.520
Don't come back here again.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.720
Oh, is that a threat?

13:28.840 --> 13:30.960
Well first you've
dump me no reason.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.320
And then you threaten me.

13:32.440 --> 13:33.280
This isn't over.

13:33.400 --> 13:35.000
I fucking love [inaudible].

13:35.120 --> 13:35.960
You bastard.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.600
I'll see you later.

13:42.720 --> 13:43.520
Don't go.

13:43.640 --> 13:45.000
It's my job, Mike.

13:45.120 --> 13:46.800
I can't just take a day offwhenever I feel like it.

13:46.920 --> 13:48.920
I mean don't go ever.

13:49.040 --> 13:51.400
Throw it in.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.760
I don't like you going
to that place everyday.

13:53.880 --> 13:55.280
The Wests are dangerous people.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.360
They're not just
petty thieves anymore.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.000
The bodies are piling up.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.160
Doogle Gibbs?

14:00.280 --> 14:01.080
I don't know
anything about that.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.240
Des McEwen--

14:02.360 --> 14:03.680
Strangled himself,
being a pervert.

14:03.800 --> 14:04.680
Evan Lace--

14:04.800 --> 14:05.680
Evan Lace, it was his ex-wife.

14:05.800 --> 14:06.680
I've seen the television news.

14:06.800 --> 14:07.600
She's bonkers.

14:07.720 --> 14:08.720
No.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.960
Rita was in it up
to her eyeballs.

14:11.080 --> 14:12.520
I don't know how or why.

14:12.640 --> 14:18.000
But I'm begging you, please,do not go into the Galleria,

14:18.120 --> 14:19.680
or tomorrow, or the next day.

14:22.480 --> 14:24.240
I need to.
It pays.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.600
We've got money,
the US dollars.

14:26.720 --> 14:30.000
Yes, and that's
going to last forever.

14:30.120 --> 14:33.440
Look, darling, Rita West
is not the big, bad wolf

14:33.560 --> 14:34.520
you seem to think.

15:02.640 --> 15:04.320
What are we doing, Wolf?

15:04.440 --> 15:05.240
There's no food.

15:05.360 --> 15:06.920
There's no money for food.

15:07.040 --> 15:09.400
If you want to piss off backto Mum's, I'm not stopping you.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.760
All I'm saying is we
can't stay here forever.

15:11.880 --> 15:13.360
Sooner or later someone'sgoing to come knocking

15:13.480 --> 15:16.160
on that door to kick us out.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.080
Shit, you see?

15:21.600 --> 15:24.520
Looking for someone
by the name of Sparky.

15:24.640 --> 15:26.080
Yeah?

15:26.200 --> 15:29.000
Full name, please.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.360
Barry George Gibbs.

15:31.480 --> 15:33.200
What's this about?

15:33.320 --> 15:34.560
Mind if I come in?

15:34.680 --> 15:37.520
You got a warrant?

15:37.640 --> 15:39.520
There's been a report
of sexual molestation.

15:39.640 --> 15:40.960
Oh, look, it's fine.

15:41.080 --> 15:42.760
Once I got over thesurprise, I was OK with it.

15:42.880 --> 15:44.320
Are you trying to be funny?

15:44.440 --> 15:46.320
He means you were the onedoing the molesting Sparky.

15:46.440 --> 15:47.440
That's not true.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.400
Yeah, well tell him that.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.000
Jesus.

15:50.120 --> 15:52.080
Taking advantage of a younglady, that's a joke to you.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.080
You're the joke, mate.

15:53.200 --> 15:54.400
Sorry?

15:54.520 --> 15:55.960
You honestly reckon
this guy right here took

15:56.080 --> 15:57.760
advantage of Janette Miller?

15:57.880 --> 15:59.400
That's what we're
investigating.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.600
Let's go down to
the station then.

16:00.720 --> 16:03.000
We'll do it all properly.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.320
The investigation is pending.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.640
Oh, well then when
it's not pending,

16:05.760 --> 16:07.120
you can come back with
your fucking warrant.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.080
And we'll do this again.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.160
Watch your language.

16:10.280 --> 16:11.040
Get out of my house.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.840
In the meantime,
if you, Barry Gibbs,

16:16.960 --> 16:18.880
go within 100 yards of theyoung lady in question--

16:19.000 --> 16:19.800
Fat chance of that.

16:19.920 --> 16:23.160
Then I will have you.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.400
You'll wish you'd never beenborn, you piece of shit.

16:35.640 --> 16:37.680
Pig.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.240
Why does everyone alwaysthink I'm a pervert?

16:42.000 --> 16:43.480
You know how you saidyou wouldn't stop me if I

16:43.600 --> 16:44.960
went back to Rita and Ted's?

16:45.080 --> 16:47.360
Bye, Sparky.

16:47.480 --> 16:49.400
Goldilocks did that to you.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.720
Janette.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.920
That little slut from
the dairy, not only

16:54.040 --> 16:54.960
is she a thief and a vandal.

16:55.080 --> 16:55.840
She's a--

16:55.960 --> 16:57.200
A molesterer.

16:57.320 --> 16:59.160
It wasn't a ghos blow job.

16:59.280 --> 17:02.760
Just Janette, and she spatit in the milk afterwards.

17:02.880 --> 17:05.200
And then she sent the
fucking police around.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.320
Yeah, and no.

17:07.440 --> 17:08.480
I mean he was a policeman.

17:08.600 --> 17:10.560
But he wasn't acting
very "policey,"

17:10.680 --> 17:13.520
if you know what I mean.

17:13.640 --> 17:14.760
What are you doing?

17:14.880 --> 17:16.200
I don't like little
girls who make up

17:16.320 --> 17:18.320
stories, stories thatcould get innocent people

17:18.440 --> 17:19.880
in a lot of trouble.

17:20.000 --> 17:21.680
- Well, give her hell, love.- Oh, I will.

17:25.800 --> 17:27.440
What about Wolf?

17:27.560 --> 17:30.960
Should we be expecting
him on the doorstep?

17:31.080 --> 17:32.720
Uh, he'll probably
just stay there

17:32.840 --> 17:34.320
until someone tells him not to.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.520
Sucker for punishment, is he?

17:36.640 --> 17:39.480
He just-- he'd just
rather stay there.

17:45.600 --> 17:46.400
I appreciate it, Shane.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.000
I really do.

17:48.120 --> 17:50.120
I mean, I still think sheshould file an official report.

17:50.240 --> 17:51.040
But she's that upset.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.560
Ah, it's OK.

17:52.680 --> 17:54.360
Those hooligans won't be
bothering Janette again.

17:54.480 --> 17:56.800
I'm having a hell of atime at the moment, you know?

17:56.920 --> 17:58.080
Dave's still away.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.600
Janet getting mixed
up with that crowd.

17:59.720 --> 18:00.760
As for the business
down the line--

18:00.880 --> 18:02.160
Yeah, Mom said.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.200
Did it get sorted?

18:03.320 --> 18:04.280
Ah, they're not
taking her back,

18:04.400 --> 18:05.840
so now I'm stuck with her.

18:05.960 --> 18:08.120
If you need me to
help, you just call.

18:08.240 --> 18:12.080
Lucky me, friends
in high places.

18:12.200 --> 18:14.000
Here, take this for your mom.

18:14.120 --> 18:14.920
Tell her I said hello.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.160
I will.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.840
Wow, isn't this a
cozy little meeting?

18:18.960 --> 18:20.560
You are banned.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.560
You put him up
to it, didn't you?

18:22.680 --> 18:25.880
Sent old pork-chop here
to bully a young man

18:26.000 --> 18:27.000
who did nothing wrong.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.240
Leave my shop now.

18:29.360 --> 18:32.760
So was it official businessthat you were on this morning?

18:32.880 --> 18:35.600
Or a little favor?

18:35.720 --> 18:38.800
Because isn't that
abusing your position?

18:38.920 --> 18:40.720
I'm protecting thecommunity from your family.

18:40.840 --> 18:43.240
And I won't make any
apologies for that.

18:43.360 --> 18:44.400
Or maybe you
just wanted to get

18:44.520 --> 18:46.720
into the daughter's nickers.

18:46.840 --> 18:48.200
Not too hard, from what I hear.

18:48.320 --> 18:49.080
Bloody cow.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.600
That's enough.

18:50.720 --> 18:55.480
Stay away from my family,you piggy little bastard.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.240
I won't rest until decent,law-abiding citizens can feel

18:58.360 --> 19:00.640
safe from the likes of you.

19:00.760 --> 19:03.520
I'll start with your kids.

19:03.640 --> 19:07.160
Wolf, what kind
of a name is that?

19:07.280 --> 19:10.440
You people are the
scum of the Earth.

19:10.560 --> 19:11.840
Now you leave Mrs.
Miller's premises.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.680
And you don't step
foot in here again.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.520
Unless you've got somethingelse you want to say to me.

19:31.640 --> 19:32.600
It was an accident.

19:32.720 --> 19:33.600
Yeah, like hell.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.080
She did it deliberately.

19:35.200 --> 19:37.280
Well, maybe she justwanted some bacon and eggs.

19:37.400 --> 19:38.560
[laughter]

19:38.680 --> 19:39.640
Are you hearing this?

19:39.760 --> 19:41.480
Fuck the pair of them.

19:41.600 --> 19:44.880
As I was saying, I raisedmy hand to make a point.

19:45.000 --> 19:47.840
And it accidentally connectedwith the tray of eggs that Mrs.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.320
Miller had kindly gifted Shanehere in return for the favor

19:51.440 --> 19:53.160
that he was doing here.

19:53.280 --> 19:54.880
The one where he went
around to my son's

19:55.000 --> 19:57.920
flat and threatened them.

19:58.040 --> 20:01.680
By the way Shane, how isthat investigation going?

20:01.800 --> 20:02.680
Still pending?

20:02.800 --> 20:04.200
OK, you should go now, Rita.

20:04.320 --> 20:07.400
Ah, yes, I will.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.480
Just try to be
a bit more careful

20:09.600 --> 20:11.440
in the future,
Rita, this raising

20:11.560 --> 20:12.840
your hand to make a point--

20:12.960 --> 20:13.760
I'll bear that in mind.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.040
Jesus, Shane, what the
fuck is wrong with you?

20:20.160 --> 20:22.360
Isn't the real question,who's fucking side are you on,

20:22.480 --> 20:23.960
Detective Sargent?

20:24.080 --> 20:25.680
Well, you be very carefulwhat you say next, Constable.

20:25.800 --> 20:28.320
Well I'm just saying, youknow them quite well, don't you?

20:28.440 --> 20:31.480
All the Hendersons
know the Wests.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.160
What's your connection?

20:33.280 --> 20:35.400
It's not just in anofficial capacity, is it?

20:35.520 --> 20:38.560
I've heard the talk
at the police bar.

20:38.680 --> 20:40.080
Your girlfriend,
she's one of them.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.560
You know Irene and herhusband are separated obviously.

20:43.680 --> 20:46.520
Those two Wests had you
by the balls just then.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.400
I mean, no wonder they thinkthey can do what they want.

20:48.520 --> 20:50.000
You dragged her inhere after a neighborhood

20:50.120 --> 20:51.200
spat between two ladies.

20:51.320 --> 20:52.400
Look at me.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.160
[inaudible] pity,
neighborhood spit.

20:54.280 --> 20:55.840
You're wasting
your time and mine.

20:55.960 --> 20:59.240
Now get the fuck out of here.

20:59.360 --> 21:15.600
[ominous music playing]

21:15.720 --> 21:16.640
Go and see Wolf.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.600
Why would I want to do that?

21:21.720 --> 21:23.160
I know you don't
like the thought

21:23.280 --> 21:25.200
of him sitting in that houseon the other side of town

21:25.320 --> 21:26.800
by himself.

21:26.920 --> 21:28.960
You want him here at yourdinner table, where he belongs.

21:29.080 --> 21:30.360
Like hell I do.

21:30.480 --> 21:32.240
He's better off where he is.- Ah, bullshit.

21:32.360 --> 21:33.680
Well, it's the truth.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.040
I don't care how old
he is or what he says.

21:36.160 --> 21:36.960
He needs his mom.

21:37.080 --> 21:40.920
That is bullshit, Ted.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.240
I have never been good at it.

21:43.360 --> 21:46.080
The baby years and thenwhen he went off the rails,

21:46.200 --> 21:47.600
I couldn't handle him.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.400
I sent him to bloody Campat Deer and Outward Bound,

21:50.520 --> 21:51.840
anything to get him
out of the house.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.360
Because I didn't knowwhat the fuck I was doing.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.160
That's not true.

21:55.280 --> 21:56.320
You've always
looked out for him.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.280
I've tried.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.520
Fuck me if I fucking tried.

21:59.640 --> 22:03.200
But everything that
I've done for him--

22:06.280 --> 22:08.160
God, it just hurts so much.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.040
It just hurts.

22:12.480 --> 22:13.280
I love that boy, Ted.

22:13.400 --> 22:14.200
I do.

22:14.320 --> 22:18.280
I love him more than--

22:18.400 --> 22:20.200
but you and I both
know that I will

22:20.320 --> 22:21.680
never be any kind of mother.

22:21.800 --> 22:22.760
No, I don't believe that.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.400
Well, just believe it, Ted.

22:24.520 --> 22:27.520
I mean, I'm the one
that tried to kill

22:27.640 --> 22:28.560
them when he was a baby.

22:28.680 --> 22:29.800
Don't, OK?

22:29.920 --> 22:30.800
Don't you dare go back there.

22:30.920 --> 22:31.680
I'm not.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.080
I'm not.

22:33.200 --> 22:37.000
I'm not going to godoolally again, I promise.

22:37.120 --> 22:40.240
But I know what I am to him now.

22:40.360 --> 22:44.400
And that is a bad influence.

22:47.680 --> 22:52.360
So we should just get
on with it, I think.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.600
Just move on.

22:53.720 --> 22:54.760
And let him do the same.

22:54.880 --> 22:59.640
Because he'll--
he'll have a chance

22:59.760 --> 23:00.760
at a better life without me.

23:51.080 --> 23:52.960
Morning.

23:53.080 --> 23:54.240
Bad night, was it?

23:54.360 --> 23:55.120
What?

23:55.240 --> 23:57.040
You don't approve?

23:57.160 --> 24:00.160
Fuck off, then.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.200
Nice attitude.

24:02.320 --> 24:05.280
Yeah, well, it's pretty
obvious why you're here.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.320
And I don't want to hearanything that bitch has to say.

24:10.920 --> 24:13.520
Don't ever speak about
your mother that way.

24:13.640 --> 24:14.760
You hear me?
Ever.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.760
She's poisoned.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.320
Evan's dead because of her.

24:21.440 --> 24:23.040
She didn't bring thatBelinda bitch back into this.

24:23.160 --> 24:24.520
Ah, OK.

24:24.640 --> 24:26.600
And how far back do
you want to go, son?

24:26.720 --> 24:27.880
Come on.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.520
If we're playing the
blame game, how far?

24:30.640 --> 24:33.000
Yeah, Rita met Belinda inside.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.240
And what was she
doing there, huh?

24:35.360 --> 24:36.760
Come on.

24:36.880 --> 24:40.640
Why was she down at Christchurchwomen's, doing a year?

24:40.760 --> 24:42.560
Because she'd rather
rot in jail herself

24:42.680 --> 24:46.920
than let her precious boy dotime for his own fucking crime.

24:49.760 --> 24:52.800
But you're not a boy
anymore, are you?

24:52.920 --> 24:54.320
So be a man.

24:54.440 --> 24:56.960
And have some goddamn
respect for a woman

24:57.080 --> 25:01.280
who, yes, has made
mistakes along the way,

25:01.400 --> 25:03.680
but who does everything--

25:03.800 --> 25:05.920
everything for you.

25:06.040 --> 25:08.840
[scuffling]

25:22.840 --> 25:26.400
The thing is, you know,
you have crappy times,

25:26.520 --> 25:29.960
where everything feels
like it's too much.

25:34.680 --> 25:36.520
But when life drops you init, what are you going to do?

25:36.640 --> 25:39.960
Just stand there
and go deep in shit?

25:40.080 --> 25:40.880
No.

25:41.000 --> 25:44.200
No, damn straight.

25:44.320 --> 25:50.120
You walk through it even if it'sa bloody great field of shit.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.120
It can't go on forever.

25:53.240 --> 25:54.600
Got to be a clear
path sooner or later.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.200
I have times with
your mom where--

26:04.320 --> 26:06.480
God, it feels like
this shit is too deep.

26:09.120 --> 26:13.680
But I knew from the
moment I saw her.

26:13.800 --> 26:16.200
She's going to be the womanthat I spend the rest of my life

26:16.320 --> 26:18.760
with.

26:18.880 --> 26:21.160
God, it was like a--

26:21.280 --> 26:27.160
It was like being hit witha fucking lightning bolt.

26:27.280 --> 26:29.200
Yeah, yeah, I know.

26:29.320 --> 26:30.320
But you wait.

26:30.440 --> 26:32.640
It will happen to
you one day too.

26:32.760 --> 26:33.680
I'm sure it will.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.400
Yeah, when you
least expect it.

26:38.440 --> 26:42.400
There she'll be,
your other half.

26:45.280 --> 26:49.760
Anyway, let's go find
that clear path, ay.

26:49.880 --> 26:51.040
I thought you'd found yours.

26:51.160 --> 26:52.080
Fuck no.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.920
But it's there.

26:54.040 --> 26:55.160
Rita and I will find it one day.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.720
Let's get you the
fuck out of Ponsonby

26:59.840 --> 27:03.200
and back to the real world.

27:03.320 --> 27:04.720
[music playing]

27:04.840 --> 27:06.200
Snap.

27:06.320 --> 27:11.160
[SINGING]: I knew 2,000 girls.

27:11.280 --> 27:15.160
My children will
never understand.

27:15.280 --> 27:19.640
I'd do it all again.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.640
Where are the boys?

27:22.760 --> 27:23.960
Tell you what,
this bloody motorway

27:24.080 --> 27:25.400
out here needs some work.

27:25.520 --> 27:27.320
Fucking A just to get
anywhere these days.

27:27.440 --> 27:28.680
Hey.

27:28.800 --> 27:30.440
Much faster on the bike
than to wait for the old

27:30.560 --> 27:31.440
bus at the [inaudible].

27:31.560 --> 27:33.240
Yes, he has returned.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.800
Finally got kicked out, ay?

27:34.920 --> 27:36.720
No, I just didn't feel likestanding in shit anymore.

27:36.840 --> 27:38.440
The bathroom wasn't
that bad, was it?

27:38.560 --> 27:40.120
Ah, you'll be
much happier here,

27:40.240 --> 27:44.920
where there's warmth and food,and milk without sperm in it.

27:45.040 --> 27:46.880
Hey.

27:47.000 --> 27:49.320
Hello.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.200
I'll just--

27:58.720 --> 28:02.560
I wondered where you'd
got to this morning.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.520
Your move.

28:27.280 --> 28:31.600
I'm so sorry about what
happened to Evan Lace.

28:34.320 --> 28:36.640
I made a mistake.

28:36.760 --> 28:39.600
I just saw this rich
prick property developer

28:39.720 --> 28:40.560
who ripped people off.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.000
And he cheated on his wife.

28:42.120 --> 28:45.960
And I just thought
that he deserved

28:46.080 --> 28:47.440
a taste of his own medicine.

28:47.560 --> 28:49.840
I know.

28:49.960 --> 28:56.520
And I put you in the
middle of it, my boy.

28:56.640 --> 28:57.960
It was a job.

28:58.080 --> 29:04.480
Yep, and I had
this idea that we

29:04.600 --> 29:07.240
could do it together, you know?

29:07.360 --> 29:10.120
Happy family, mother
and son business.

29:16.520 --> 29:21.720
I've never given you achance at a straight life.

29:21.840 --> 29:22.840
Do you think
that's what I want?

29:25.640 --> 29:28.200
I don't know.

29:28.320 --> 29:31.120
I've never asked you.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.800
No chance.

29:33.920 --> 29:38.800
What we do, it's in my blood.

29:38.920 --> 29:41.040
And blood is thicker than water.

29:41.160 --> 29:43.160
That's what you've always said.

29:43.280 --> 29:44.120
OK.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.480
Well, good then.

29:49.480 --> 29:54.960
What gets me is Evan
had no one in the end.

30:00.680 --> 30:01.480
I don't want to be that guy.

30:05.040 --> 30:07.840
I want to be the guy who, in theend, no one gives a fuck about.

30:15.720 --> 30:16.520
I give a fuck, Wolf.

30:22.000 --> 30:22.760
Thanks.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.960
This is your
present from America.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.960
It's been sitting
there way too long.

31:12.360 --> 31:15.560
Here, hi.

31:15.680 --> 31:16.480
Let me do that.

31:19.960 --> 31:20.960
How was your day?

31:21.080 --> 31:21.960
Yeah, it was OK.

31:24.640 --> 31:28.000
So um, [inaudible]
Tracy is leaving,

31:28.120 --> 31:30.520
the admin girl at the station.She's having a baby.

31:30.640 --> 31:31.680
Oh, really?

31:31.800 --> 31:34.520
Yeah, so her job's going.

31:34.640 --> 31:36.280
Oh, yeah?

31:36.400 --> 31:37.160
Yeah.

31:37.280 --> 31:38.080
She's not sworn in.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.280
It's a civilian position.

31:41.920 --> 31:43.560
What's so funny?

31:43.680 --> 31:45.560
And you want me to do it?

31:45.680 --> 31:47.760
I'm not going to work forthe bloody police, Mike.

31:47.880 --> 31:49.080
Honestly.

31:49.200 --> 31:52.040
Well, what's wrong
with the bloody police?

31:52.160 --> 31:54.640
Right, we're still the
enemy to you, aren't we?

31:54.760 --> 31:55.840
I'm still the enemy.

31:55.960 --> 31:57.040
No, you're not.

31:57.160 --> 32:00.360
But no, I couldn't.

32:07.920 --> 32:11.760
You're making life
difficult for me, Nyrie.

32:11.880 --> 32:13.360
I'm sorry?

32:13.480 --> 32:19.040
I'm being tarred with thesame brush as your former life.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.720
If I could just get to
know you now to see that

32:20.840 --> 32:22.320
you are a normal, decent woman.

32:22.440 --> 32:26.600
But I'm not normal or decent.

32:26.720 --> 32:27.840
You chose this.

32:27.960 --> 32:31.600
You knew who I am,
how I live my life.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.600
Wasn't that part of
the attraction, Mike?

32:33.720 --> 32:34.720
OK.

32:34.840 --> 32:35.720
Look, forget about
the admin job.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.160
We'll find you something else.

32:37.280 --> 32:38.320
Look, another shop somewherewith a fresh start.

32:38.440 --> 32:39.720
Mike, stop.

32:39.840 --> 32:41.400
I can't leave the Galleria.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.400
Because I'm cooking the books,and I'm fixing stolen property,

32:43.520 --> 32:45.000
and I'm in it up to my neck.

32:48.920 --> 32:52.800
I made a deal with Ritaafter she found out about us.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.400
She promised she wouldn'ttell Lefty or anyone else,

32:55.520 --> 32:57.080
so long as I gotinvolved in the business.

32:59.960 --> 33:01.280
And then I went and
made it all very public

33:01.400 --> 33:02.760
by moving in with you.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.600
So she doesn't haveanything over you anymore.

33:04.720 --> 33:05.720
She's not going
to want to give

33:05.840 --> 33:08.840
up her insurance policy, Mike.

33:08.960 --> 33:11.720
My fingerprints are
all over everything.

33:11.840 --> 33:12.640
Fuck.

33:18.000 --> 33:19.800
OK.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.120
Here's what you tell Rita.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.040
I won't go near her.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.680
I'll turn a blind eye
to whatever the fuck

33:25.800 --> 33:29.560
she gets up to in theGalleria if she let you go.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.600
You'd do that for me?

33:34.720 --> 33:36.720
Of course.

33:36.840 --> 33:37.720
I love you.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.600
So trendy.

33:42.720 --> 33:45.920
They have such good
shopping in America.

33:46.040 --> 33:49.000
Oh, it's so good to
have to home again.

33:49.120 --> 33:50.680
Leave the man alone, Carol.

33:50.800 --> 33:51.560
Hello again.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.960
[indistinct chatter]

34:05.360 --> 34:07.200
Who puts money in
a hole in the wall,

34:07.320 --> 34:09.640
just sitting there for thelikes of us to help ourselves.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.440
Banks must be stupid.

34:11.560 --> 34:14.600
Money machines, even thename sounds like an invitation.

34:14.720 --> 34:16.560
Hey, money machines.

34:16.680 --> 34:17.920
They'll never take off.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.480
They'll be around for
a couple of months

34:19.600 --> 34:21.680
before they go back to keepingthe money inside the bank.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.480
That's why we've
got to work fast.

34:23.600 --> 34:24.920
Fuck the money machines.

34:25.040 --> 34:27.640
To the banks and theirnew fandangled technology,

34:27.760 --> 34:30.080
taking all the hard
work out of robbery.

34:30.200 --> 34:31.560
Fuck the money machines.

34:31.680 --> 34:33.840
Fuck the money machines.

34:33.960 --> 34:34.760
It got stuck.

34:34.880 --> 34:36.600
[laughter]

34:36.720 --> 34:38.400
That's terrible.

34:38.520 --> 34:40.080
Oh, shit.

34:40.200 --> 34:41.560
Have one of mine.

34:41.680 --> 34:42.560
Oh, no thanks, love.

34:42.680 --> 34:43.480
Menthol.

34:43.600 --> 34:44.600
I can go get you some.

34:44.720 --> 34:46.720
No, no, you stay
here and relax.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.040
Well, I could do with a walk.

34:48.160 --> 34:48.960
All right, then.

34:49.080 --> 34:50.080
Thanks, love.

34:50.200 --> 34:51.760
But don't go to
the bloody dairy.

34:51.880 --> 34:54.440
Yeah, [inaudible] for Janetteto lie in there and wait.

34:54.560 --> 34:55.960
We should go and
do the [inaudible]..

34:56.080 --> 34:57.240
Nice idea, but no.

34:57.360 --> 34:58.640
We need to keep away.

34:58.760 --> 35:00.600
She'll get hers, her
and her bloody mother.

35:00.720 --> 35:01.560
Go to the Four Square.

35:05.480 --> 35:08.760
Uh, we've got a bit of a fullhouse at the moment, Nyrie.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.000
I can see that.

35:10.120 --> 35:11.080
It'll only take a
moment of your time.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.840
I need to quit
from the Galleria.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.280
I can't work for you anymore.

35:20.400 --> 35:21.600
It won't be a problem for you.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.480
Mike has sworn that
he'll leave you alone.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.880
Is that so?

35:26.000 --> 35:27.400
He means it.

35:27.520 --> 35:31.480
Wow, he must really
want you out of there.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.840
What do you want?

35:32.960 --> 35:33.920
Me?

35:34.040 --> 35:36.600
Yeah, Nyrie, you.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.960
Well, I-- it doesn't matter.

35:40.080 --> 35:40.960
Because Mike has--

35:41.080 --> 35:42.520
Bullshit, it doesn't matter.

35:42.640 --> 35:45.480
You don't want to leave, do you?

35:45.600 --> 35:48.080
No, I don't.

35:48.200 --> 35:50.480
I like it there, despite you.

35:50.600 --> 35:51.400
Charmed.

35:51.520 --> 35:53.720
You know what I mean.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.840
Do you remember
what you said to me?

35:56.960 --> 36:01.920
How you fell for him,
of all fucking people,

36:02.040 --> 36:05.160
because he was kind,
treats you well.

36:05.280 --> 36:06.400
That's what you said.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.000
I did.

36:08.120 --> 36:12.640
So you go home and you tellMike McCarthy to get fucked.

36:12.760 --> 36:15.080
You tell him that you werealready married to one,

36:15.200 --> 36:17.000
selfish, domineering asshole.

36:17.120 --> 36:18.200
And you didn't
give up everything

36:18.320 --> 36:20.040
to be bullied by another one.

36:20.160 --> 36:21.560
You tell him that
you're not quitting.

36:21.680 --> 36:25.040
And if he doesn't likeit, he can fuck right off.

36:25.160 --> 36:26.720
And then you give
them a blow job,

36:26.840 --> 36:28.840
so he'll know what he's
missing if he does.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.120
You got all that?

36:30.240 --> 36:31.000
Yes.

36:35.240 --> 36:38.400
Yes, thank you.

36:38.520 --> 36:39.320
You're welcome.

36:51.680 --> 36:52.640
Leftie.

36:52.760 --> 36:53.520
Nyrie.

37:00.080 --> 37:01.920
Thank god, no aggro.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.880
My point, we've all moved on.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.440
Yeah.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.560
We're one great big, happy,bloody family around here.

37:08.680 --> 37:09.440
Isn't it?

37:40.360 --> 37:41.280
Smoking's bad for you.

37:45.280 --> 37:46.080
Not as bad as I can be.

37:52.120 --> 37:53.920
You going to pay for them?

37:54.040 --> 37:56.560
I wasn't planning on it.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.880
Just asking.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.840
They're not for me.

38:00.960 --> 38:04.200
Oh, well that makes
all the difference.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.200
Is Janette here?

38:07.320 --> 38:09.800
You know her, do you?

38:09.920 --> 38:12.200
Kind of.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.760
Are you him?

38:14.880 --> 38:16.680
Who?

38:16.800 --> 38:19.280
Why she's been sent away.

38:19.400 --> 38:22.560
Are you the Wolf?

38:22.680 --> 38:25.440
Yeah, I'm him.

38:25.560 --> 38:26.480
Yeah, I figured as much.

38:31.400 --> 38:32.520
You should take
the smokes and go.

38:35.160 --> 38:37.240
Is your mom here?

38:37.360 --> 38:41.560
No, just me.

38:41.680 --> 38:47.560
Well then, I could
take anything I want.

38:47.680 --> 38:49.040
You can try.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.440
You going to stop me, are you?

38:53.800 --> 38:54.960
Take whatever you want.

38:55.080 --> 38:56.560
Just from what my
sister said, you sounded

38:56.680 --> 38:58.600
more interesting than that.

38:58.720 --> 39:00.240
Did I?

39:00.360 --> 39:03.040
Back when she was all abouther hot, dangerous boyfriend,

39:03.160 --> 39:04.680
yeah.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.760
Right before she freaked thefuck and go shit down country.

39:07.880 --> 39:11.400
And then you arrived
to take her place.

39:11.520 --> 39:15.160
I'm no one's placeholder,especially not Janette.

39:18.760 --> 39:20.280
I can see that.

39:20.400 --> 39:21.160
Can you?

39:27.320 --> 39:30.480
So what I'm hearing
is I can take anything

39:30.600 --> 39:34.000
I damn well like in this store.

39:34.120 --> 39:37.600
My guess, if you
did that is that you'd

39:37.720 --> 39:39.360
make even less than openingyour own fucking dairy.

39:39.480 --> 39:40.960
Well, you have a foul mouth.

39:41.080 --> 39:42.960
At least I don't smoke.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.320
Neither do I.

39:44.440 --> 39:47.320
You just steal them.

39:47.440 --> 39:50.920
You know, I've
heard about you.

39:51.040 --> 39:53.800
You're trouble
apparently, which is

39:53.920 --> 39:57.600
saying something if yoursister is anything to go by.

39:57.720 --> 40:00.720
I just have problems
doing what I'm told.

40:00.840 --> 40:02.160
Yeah?

40:02.280 --> 40:03.080
Yeah.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.320
And I've heard about you.

40:08.440 --> 40:09.880
All good, I'm sure.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.760
Not in the slightest.

40:11.880 --> 40:14.000
I guess that explains it.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.880
Explains what?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.800
What we have going on.

40:18.920 --> 40:19.880
Which is?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.440
Along the lines of this.

40:24.120 --> 40:26.920
You reckon, do you?

40:27.040 --> 40:28.560
No, I know.

[music playing]

40:40.080 --> 40:42.000
Where is Wolf with
those bloody snacks?

40:47.760 --> 40:49.360
He'll be taking
longer because he

40:49.480 --> 40:51.120
had to go to the Four Square.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.520
Bloody dairy family,making life inconvenient.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.440
[moaning]

41:06.560 --> 41:07.400
Fuck me.

41:15.960 --> 41:17.640
You're a life saver.

41:17.760 --> 41:19.080
Nice to have
your boy back, ay.

41:19.200 --> 41:20.320
Shit yeah.

41:20.440 --> 41:22.840
And this time, I'm
not letting him go.

41:29.040 --> 41:30.400
Oh, my fucking god.

42:01.280 --> 42:02.920
Thank you for your
kind offer today,

42:03.040 --> 42:05.200
or should I say, your ultimatum.

42:05.320 --> 42:06.480
It wasn't an ultimatum.

42:06.600 --> 42:07.560
I was just telling
you what I would like.

42:07.680 --> 42:10.760
And now I'm telling you.

42:10.880 --> 42:12.800
I will stay at the Galleria.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.400
Because I like it.

42:14.520 --> 42:16.720
It makes me happy.

42:16.840 --> 42:19.920
And if I'm happy, then it willfollow that you are happy.

42:20.040 --> 42:21.560
Yeah, but--

42:21.680 --> 42:26.720
But if I am unhappy, then byGod, you will know about it.

42:26.840 --> 42:29.280
But I'm sure it
won't come to that.

42:29.400 --> 42:32.000
Because you are a kind
and considerate man.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.840
That's why I'm here.

42:42.960 --> 42:44.480
Don't ever forget it.

43:06.920 --> 43:11.640
Uh, you do know that I'vebeen here before, right?

43:11.760 --> 43:15.600
You might not want tomention that to my old lady.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.760
She really as
evil as my mom says?

43:17.880 --> 43:18.640
Maybe.

43:43.240 --> 43:44.720
Come here, my love.

43:44.840 --> 43:45.600
Muah.

43:49.920 --> 43:52.480
Oh, I was beginning tothink you've been kidnapped.

43:52.600 --> 43:55.600
Mom, there's somebody
I'd like you to meet.

43:55.720 --> 43:57.800
Hello, Wolf's mom.
