04:14.654 --> 04:15.887
Constance?

04:18.624 --> 04:19.991
Constance do you read me?

04:19.993 --> 04:22.494
Constance are you reading me?

04:22.496 --> 04:23.728
Constance.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.398
Your location.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.167
Constance this is...

04:30.503 --> 04:33.338
Can you read me?

04:34.640 --> 04:35.874
Constance?

04:40.012 --> 04:42.214
I'm locked in to your location.

04:44.317 --> 04:45.584
Constance.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.085
Constance. Read me.

04:53.759 --> 04:55.060
Constance.

04:56.262 --> 04:57.562
Don't move.

04:58.197 --> 04:59.998
I'm locked on to your location.

05:02.702 --> 05:03.935
I'm reading you.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.837
Vital signs are...

05:12.144 --> 05:13.778
target...

05:17.551 --> 05:18.583
bravo...

05:19.118 --> 05:20.118
target...

05:29.028 --> 05:30.095
Constance...

05:31.898 --> 05:34.065
I think your suit may have...

05:34.067 --> 05:37.035
Activated your life-saving
module pre-maturely.

05:40.306 --> 05:41.573
Argh.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.174
Okay.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.609
I got you.

06:04.363 --> 06:05.764
Where are the others?

06:06.933 --> 06:08.600
They're about...

06:10.703 --> 06:12.737
Southeast of this position.

06:23.449 --> 06:26.751
We must stay above
this planet's sea level.

06:29.689 --> 06:32.457
All the plates beneath us...

06:34.093 --> 06:36.094
Are shifting.

06:36.096 --> 06:37.128
Hey.

06:37.630 --> 06:39.097
You okay?

06:42.868 --> 06:44.703
Have you heard from Zan?

06:46.105 --> 06:49.741
Got caught in the storm.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.210
She may be further
north than we anticipated.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.648
She's off course.

06:58.150 --> 06:59.484
And we don't know...

06:59.986 --> 07:02.721
About the terrain of demo.

07:09.562 --> 07:10.862
We're running out of time.

07:11.964 --> 07:13.832
I say we...

07:13.834 --> 07:15.667
Stay along the coast...

07:16.802 --> 07:18.870
Head towards the mountains.

07:32.818 --> 07:34.519
Oxygen warning.

07:34.521 --> 07:38.423
Oxygen levels are
at dangerous parameters.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.810
The air pressure
is dropping rapidly.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.749
You picking that up?

09:14.855 --> 09:15.920
If we remain out here...

09:18.691 --> 09:20.959
Our suits will be compromised.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.937
I think we should head back.

09:32.939 --> 09:34.773
Hit this place in the morning.

09:49.121 --> 09:50.855
The spire...

09:51.824 --> 09:53.458
Created life.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.328
Everything in
the known universe.

10:15.247 --> 10:16.381
No.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.185
Our mission is to stay
alive long enough

10:20.187 --> 10:22.520
then to recover the spire.

10:28.794 --> 10:32.030
Everything we lost...
Due to terminus.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.599
Our oceans,

10:37.536 --> 10:39.938
our natural resources,

10:43.943 --> 10:46.511
can all be made new again.

10:53.018 --> 10:57.121
Our cerebral links seem
to be functioning now.

14:45.117 --> 14:46.184
Reed.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.555
Why did you phase?

14:56.295 --> 14:58.129
We were pinned down.

15:19.618 --> 15:21.119
Like I said...

15:21.954 --> 15:23.554
We were pinned down.

15:26.258 --> 15:28.326
You know what she's like.

15:29.561 --> 15:32.497
She couldn't cut it
with what's happening here.

15:35.167 --> 15:39.237
You wanna keep arguing
about what happened on earth?

15:39.239 --> 15:42.306
Or should we concentrate
on what's happening now?

17:27.346 --> 17:30.281
I've never seen
formations like this.

17:33.919 --> 17:36.387
I don't like the look of that.

17:48.301 --> 17:53.704
The atmosphere is changing
from nitrogen to oxygen.

18:10.555 --> 18:12.823
It's adapting.

18:19.097 --> 18:21.365
How is that possible?

18:22.467 --> 18:24.568
Adapting to what?

18:27.773 --> 18:29.507
To us.

18:32.411 --> 18:35.713
This is no storm.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.888
This planet is on the defensive.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.827
It's sinking into itself.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.441
We have to move.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.412
Now.

19:54.659 --> 19:56.127
Reed!

19:57.396 --> 19:58.462
Reed!

20:10.876 --> 20:11.942
Wait!

21:06.064 --> 21:09.934
It is my hope that we can
truly get on one accord

21:09.936 --> 21:11.602
with this mission,

21:11.604 --> 21:14.839
or we are destined to fail
before it begins.

21:47.272 --> 21:50.674
Demo, a subgalatic anomaly,

21:51.776 --> 21:54.512
a paradox in motion,
if you will.

21:55.947 --> 21:59.049
The order has known of its
existence for quite some time.

22:01.186 --> 22:05.222
The order took me from my home,

22:05.224 --> 22:08.125
stripped me of my childhood.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.942
Are these the memories
that you are recalling?

22:34.553 --> 22:36.086
Terminus...

22:36.721 --> 22:39.256
A catastrophic autoimmune virus

22:39.258 --> 22:41.425
that latches onto its hosts.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.395
When the order discovered

22:44.397 --> 22:47.731
that a select few were
immune to terminus' effects,

22:47.733 --> 22:49.600
we began cultivating

22:49.602 --> 22:53.270
a unique system of
raising them free from society.

22:54.906 --> 22:56.740
One showed the ability

22:56.742 --> 23:00.077
to not only resist
terminus' effects,

23:00.079 --> 23:02.780
but to manipulate
the very dark matter

23:02.782 --> 23:04.648
flowing through her veins.

23:08.853 --> 23:10.754
It is of our belief

23:10.756 --> 23:13.123
that mankind's
survival hinges upon

23:13.125 --> 23:16.627
your very essence
to resist terminus.

23:23.602 --> 23:26.704
Yes, I have a personal stake
in this mission.

23:28.873 --> 23:30.541
How long?

23:35.046 --> 23:36.780
The spire...

23:38.216 --> 23:40.050
Do you remember anything?

23:44.756 --> 23:47.257
It goes without saying
that not only

23:47.259 --> 23:50.060
do you hold the fate
of my life in your hands,

23:50.062 --> 23:54.064
but the survival of
all mankind is at stake.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.801
Even that of your
fellow eternals.

23:58.837 --> 24:00.371
Eternals?

24:01.506 --> 24:06.510
The order's name for those
who survive the training.

24:06.512 --> 24:07.645
The immune.

24:12.083 --> 24:14.652
I think I do remember.

24:18.657 --> 24:19.757
What?

24:20.925 --> 24:22.493
What is it?

24:22.694 --> 24:23.761
Death.

24:25.530 --> 24:27.665
Searing bones rapturing.

24:30.435 --> 24:33.704
Screams, echoing throughout.

24:35.540 --> 24:36.774
Silence.

24:37.776 --> 24:39.777
No lives.

24:40.545 --> 24:42.546
Bones on top of bones,

24:42.548 --> 24:45.182
drenched in their own blood.

24:50.789 --> 24:54.958
The spire has data predating
the creation of earth,

24:54.960 --> 24:59.730
and to obtain it would lead us
to a cure for terminus.

24:59.732 --> 25:03.133
Demo is comprised
of pure dark matter,

25:03.135 --> 25:05.302
and seeing that you
and the eternals

25:05.304 --> 25:08.872
are the only ones able
to get in its contents

25:10.075 --> 25:12.076
I feel you have been misled.

25:13.311 --> 25:17.781
Let's believe that this mission
is a matter of options.

25:19.751 --> 25:22.720
But let me reassure
you that the moment

25:22.722 --> 25:25.889
you are no longer
a valuable part of this mission,

25:25.891 --> 25:28.592
there will be no
hesitation from the order

25:28.594 --> 25:30.327
to subject you to pain

25:30.329 --> 25:32.730
so far beyond the reaches
of your comprehension

25:32.732 --> 25:37.401
that you will be begging
for cryosleep.

25:37.403 --> 25:39.737
Do we understand each other?

25:44.576 --> 25:46.610
I'd get that looked at.

25:59.624 --> 26:01.024
Leave me.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.305
Zan Desai.

26:16.274 --> 26:18.475
Zan Desai of the eternals.

26:25.750 --> 26:26.950
Zan Desai...

26:26.952 --> 26:28.118
Your pain receptors

26:28.120 --> 26:30.954
are peaking at the
40% terminally injured.

26:34.793 --> 26:39.863
Zan Desai, would you like pain
reducing stimulus administered?

26:46.805 --> 26:49.540
I need you to stop
using my full name.

26:51.342 --> 26:53.076
If you wish.

26:58.016 --> 27:00.083
And the others?

27:00.085 --> 27:01.351
The others?

27:04.289 --> 27:07.191
What's the status of the
last known coordinates?

27:07.193 --> 27:09.026
Last known reading
of dark matter

27:09.028 --> 27:12.362
is 20 miles due north
of your current position.

27:16.000 --> 27:18.669
The four eternals
are still alive.

27:18.671 --> 27:21.104
Your mission to find
this planet's spire

27:21.106 --> 27:22.539
is still active.

27:24.676 --> 27:25.876
Four?

27:27.545 --> 27:28.612
Seagon,

27:28.614 --> 27:29.446
Tilly,

27:29.448 --> 27:30.380
Constance,

27:30.382 --> 27:32.516
and Reed are all that remain.

27:43.228 --> 27:47.030
Kiva, phase me
to the nearest eternal.

27:47.032 --> 27:49.700
Your cerebral
connections have been severed.

27:49.702 --> 27:53.437
Phasing is no longer an option
you possess on this side.

28:07.819 --> 28:09.119
It's just me then.

28:13.425 --> 28:14.491
Good.

28:17.662 --> 28:18.662
Zan.

28:19.564 --> 28:23.066
Without phasing with
an eternal on earth,

28:23.068 --> 28:25.435
you can no longer return home.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.936
I'm gonna kill him.

28:58.938 --> 28:59.736
I'm gonna kill...

28:59.738 --> 29:01.204
Tilly, hey.

29:03.975 --> 29:06.610
Did he phase? Asshole.

29:07.211 --> 29:09.179
- You okay?
- Yeah.

29:11.282 --> 29:12.482
No, it's Ok.

29:12.484 --> 29:13.784
Hey,

29:13.952 --> 29:14.985
look at me.

29:14.987 --> 29:16.119
Hey.

29:16.121 --> 29:17.121
Tilly.

29:18.089 --> 29:19.289
You're safe.

29:19.991 --> 29:22.459
Calm down,
tell me what happened.

29:29.467 --> 29:32.169
We were above ground
going through sector 7,

29:32.171 --> 29:34.871
approaching a large hoard
of the infected.

29:37.008 --> 29:41.812
Okay, all right,
and then what happened?

29:41.814 --> 29:43.914
Well, then...

29:45.416 --> 29:48.518
Then Reed suggested we
go toward the spire's location.

29:48.520 --> 29:51.154
The spire?
Did you find the spire?

29:51.156 --> 29:52.189
I don't know. I...

29:52.191 --> 29:53.423
You don't know
if you found the spire?

29:53.425 --> 29:54.925
I don't know.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.526
Shit, Tilly.

30:00.665 --> 30:02.099
Alright,

30:02.101 --> 30:05.168
so you were looking for
the spire and then what next?

30:06.371 --> 30:08.605
We didn't expect for there
to be so many of the infected

30:08.607 --> 30:10.107
from down below.

30:11.209 --> 30:13.210
The air pressure's
way too dense.

30:14.779 --> 30:15.779
Yeah.

30:16.814 --> 30:17.814
Okay.

30:18.649 --> 30:20.684
That-that can only
mean one thing.

30:25.690 --> 30:27.090
They're evolving.

30:31.796 --> 30:33.697
Okay, Tilly,

30:36.467 --> 30:39.202
I'm gonna ask you a question,

30:39.204 --> 30:42.139
and it's very important
that you understand

30:42.141 --> 30:43.707
the meaning of this.

30:45.076 --> 30:48.011
Alright, listen,
if you have the map

30:48.013 --> 30:50.147
alright, then we... it should
tell us something.

30:50.149 --> 30:51.882
What is our next move?

30:55.219 --> 30:57.788
Have we made contact
with Zan on demo?

30:58.756 --> 31:00.157
No.

31:00.159 --> 31:03.093
We've not made
communication with Zan.

31:03.095 --> 31:05.395
Or the Alpha team.

31:05.397 --> 31:07.264
Because we fear they
may be disbanded.

31:10.234 --> 31:12.602
So what does that mean for us?

31:13.604 --> 31:17.274
Before the order went dark
they spoke of a spire.

31:19.343 --> 31:22.579
I suggest that we find it
and we prepare.

31:23.714 --> 31:26.083
And we need to prepare.

31:26.085 --> 31:27.851
- Prepare?
- Yes.

31:27.853 --> 31:30.454
How do you expect us to
prepare for something like that?

31:30.456 --> 31:33.990
I expect us to prepare
the way you were trained.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.028
You understand that
they sent a species

31:38.030 --> 31:39.663
to demo to terraform it,

31:40.698 --> 31:43.767
and it's just biting
the hand that feeds it.

31:45.937 --> 31:47.971
The most important
thing right now

31:49.207 --> 31:52.309
is for you to let us know
what our next move is.

31:52.311 --> 31:54.811
We only have
a limited amount of time.

31:55.613 --> 31:57.214
And while you're standing here

31:57.216 --> 31:59.816
focused on what's
going on on demo,

32:00.918 --> 32:02.385
earth is dying.

32:04.489 --> 32:06.156
Now do you remember anything?

32:07.258 --> 32:09.159
According to the map
there's a telepanel up ahead.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.894
Okay.

32:10.896 --> 32:13.630
I can take the lead, there might
be more of the infected here.

32:13.632 --> 32:16.600
Your judgment right now
is not sound.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.935
You have forgotten
your training.

32:18.937 --> 32:21.638
You're emotional,
you are connected.

32:23.274 --> 32:25.509
And your way of thinking
is gonna get us either caught,

32:25.511 --> 32:27.410
captured, or killed.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.248
And make no
mistake about it, Tilly,

32:31.250 --> 32:34.317
if you jeopardize this mission
to find the spire,

32:34.319 --> 32:36.186
to do what the order
put us here to do,

32:36.188 --> 32:38.588
I will kill you myself.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.223
Of course.

32:41.859 --> 32:43.326
Push forward.

32:44.262 --> 32:45.328
Now.

34:30.568 --> 34:32.502
What is the meaning of this?

34:43.748 --> 34:45.782
The meaning of everything,

34:45.784 --> 34:49.619
explained by the fragment
of a live comet.

34:51.389 --> 34:52.822
Fascinating.

34:54.058 --> 34:58.061
I have full autonomy over
the eternal initiative.

34:58.063 --> 34:59.462
This is a mistake.

35:02.967 --> 35:06.503
Billions, and billions
of years of data

35:06.505 --> 35:10.507
transported from
millennium to millennium

35:10.509 --> 35:14.811
by nature's own fiery vessel.

35:14.813 --> 35:18.315
To think of all the
philosophers, scientists,

35:18.317 --> 35:20.650
and zealots on this planet

35:20.652 --> 35:23.520
and not one of them
thought to ask

35:23.522 --> 35:25.722
the quintessential question.

35:26.757 --> 35:28.925
Not "are we alone?"

35:30.161 --> 35:31.361
It is:

35:31.829 --> 35:33.997
"How would we communicate

35:33.999 --> 35:36.433
with beings
from lightyears away?"

35:41.172 --> 35:44.507
To create gods out of ideals
based on our own basic

35:44.509 --> 35:47.744
understanding
of the time continuum,

35:48.546 --> 35:50.480
to now know

35:50.482 --> 35:53.516
that god is not an "it",

35:54.352 --> 35:55.952
but a "now".

35:57.021 --> 35:59.923
Evolution is
a funny thing, viceroy.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.148
The discovery of dark matter

36:25.150 --> 36:27.917
wedged between
the crevices of a comet,

36:29.253 --> 36:31.554
the essence
of all living things.

36:39.363 --> 36:41.598
The order believed
many moons ago

36:41.600 --> 36:44.567
that the spire was responsible

36:44.569 --> 36:46.469
for creating life on our planet.

36:47.538 --> 36:50.507
A device of unknown origins,

36:51.409 --> 36:55.044
capable of generating
enough dark matter

36:55.046 --> 36:58.915
to completely remap
the cosmos as we knew it.

37:00.017 --> 37:03.453
But this theory was untested
and the first true sign

37:03.455 --> 37:05.922
came in the form
of a little girl.

37:06.857 --> 37:10.126
Now we don't know
why the spire on earth

37:10.128 --> 37:11.795
was responsive to her.

37:11.797 --> 37:15.465
But it allowed her to see a map

37:15.467 --> 37:17.200
to a planet

37:17.202 --> 37:19.636
that had long been forgotten.

37:20.704 --> 37:22.372
Demo.

37:22.374 --> 37:26.075
With our elementary understanding
of life and its creation,

37:26.077 --> 37:29.045
the order sent a
docile creature to demo,

37:29.047 --> 37:32.115
long before the
spire spoke to Zan.

37:35.252 --> 37:38.922
The idea was that if a simple
creature would survive

37:38.924 --> 37:42.225
the worst of an unknown planet,

37:42.227 --> 37:47.964
then surely mankind would be
given a greater chance.

37:47.966 --> 37:52.469
The order's first dealing
with mankind's survival,

37:52.471 --> 37:54.571
a second home.

37:56.073 --> 37:59.375
But evolution is
a funny thing, viceroy.

38:00.311 --> 38:02.645
With time, I believe
that the eternals

38:02.647 --> 38:06.115
will be able to lead us
to the spire on demo,

38:06.117 --> 38:07.984
and to activate it
in conjunction

38:07.986 --> 38:09.853
with the spire on earth

38:09.855 --> 38:12.589
and help us
to eliminate terminus.

38:12.591 --> 38:14.591
And seeing as how
they are immune

38:14.593 --> 38:15.959
to the virus' effects,

38:15.961 --> 38:18.361
they will work on the teams.

38:18.363 --> 38:20.129
Phasing from unit to unit

38:20.131 --> 38:22.665
and running
the necessary calculations

38:22.667 --> 38:24.434
to run both alien devices.

38:25.503 --> 38:29.672
Viceroy, the order grow
weary of the expediency

38:29.674 --> 38:32.609
or lack thereof,
of your results.

38:34.879 --> 38:38.848
We will have
what lies in her mind.

38:38.850 --> 38:42.719
We will have the secrets
that are buried deep within her.

38:42.721 --> 38:44.554
Zan has begun remembering.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.789
And if we push any further

38:46.791 --> 38:48.525
than we already have,

38:48.527 --> 38:51.728
we could lose out on the ability

38:51.730 --> 38:53.796
of activating the spire on demo.

38:53.798 --> 38:56.299
And if we wait longer
the spire on earth

38:56.301 --> 38:59.335
will no longer be
a viable option for survival.

38:59.337 --> 39:01.938
Earth will no longer
be worth saving.

39:03.173 --> 39:05.074
So you send them to die?

39:07.244 --> 39:08.578
So be it.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.858
When I was a little girl,

39:56.927 --> 40:01.297
my mother told me
about the... the time

40:01.299 --> 40:04.667
when the lands were
as green as emeralds,

40:08.272 --> 40:10.506
and the oceans...

40:11.809 --> 40:14.043
Were as blue as the sky.

40:38.168 --> 40:40.737
She was a great woman.

40:40.739 --> 40:42.805
You remind me of her.

43:29.473 --> 43:32.708
The readings of dark
matter are off the charts.

44:19.389 --> 44:21.657
You're wasting your time.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.893
You can't phase with this
much radial interference.

44:31.335 --> 44:33.369
Think she found the spire?

44:34.504 --> 44:36.839
It's not gonna matter!

44:36.841 --> 44:41.377
We're not got lives long
enough to find her on earth.

44:41.379 --> 44:43.613
Or what's left of it.

44:47.317 --> 44:50.887
2,000 years of
research, articles,

44:50.889 --> 44:52.054
and theories,

44:52.056 --> 44:54.223
and this may very well be

44:54.225 --> 44:56.592
more important than any of it.

44:58.528 --> 45:00.596
And she's the key, Reed.

45:04.234 --> 45:07.169
We're the last of the eternals.

45:07.171 --> 45:12.008
Everything, mission,
this planet,

45:12.010 --> 45:14.577
everything based on
her one moment

45:14.579 --> 45:16.612
with an alien machine.

45:19.216 --> 45:22.218
And now we can't phase.

45:22.220 --> 45:24.253
We can't sync with her.

45:25.289 --> 45:27.490
She could be dead
for all we know.

45:28.759 --> 45:30.927
We're not far behind.

45:33.196 --> 45:35.598
So until you can assure me that

45:35.600 --> 45:38.401
we're not just aimlessly
wandering a planet

45:38.403 --> 45:41.203
that's trying to kill us
at every turn,

45:43.206 --> 45:46.008
I'm gonna be relying on my own
instincts from here on out.

45:55.585 --> 45:57.687
This is our final mission.

45:59.723 --> 46:02.825
Zan will find the spire,
and turn it on.

46:02.827 --> 46:04.593
She will ignite
the one on earth.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.196
All we have to do
is follow the plan.

46:09.566 --> 46:11.000
Until then,

46:11.002 --> 46:13.836
we phase only when a
member of delta team needs us,

46:13.838 --> 46:15.237
and not before.

46:18.075 --> 46:19.408
Come on.

46:34.758 --> 46:36.525
Sector 5.

46:40.697 --> 46:42.398
It's where they found me.

46:44.968 --> 46:47.870
People destroying,

46:47.872 --> 46:51.140
ravishing each other
in an uncontrollable rage.

46:51.142 --> 46:55.277
The virus released
completely undetected.

46:56.213 --> 46:59.482
Re-populating in an instant.

46:59.484 --> 47:04.020
Thousands of lives lost.

47:07.224 --> 47:08.724
Sector 5.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.061
That was the
first infected city.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.498
Yeah.

47:16.199 --> 47:18.234
So forgive me
if I'm a little less

47:18.236 --> 47:20.302
than optimistic
about our chances.

47:24.241 --> 47:26.242
Look around you.

47:26.244 --> 47:28.044
Everything's changed.

47:28.046 --> 47:29.979
We've changed.

47:35.385 --> 47:38.788
We are the only ones capable
of completing the mission.

47:39.923 --> 47:42.091
We are the only ones left.

47:53.036 --> 47:56.005
What do your readings
tell us about the atmosphere?

48:03.246 --> 48:04.980
The conditions here...

48:06.283 --> 48:09.085
Would fit perfectly
within our biometrics.

48:13.290 --> 48:16.725
The density in the air molecules

48:16.727 --> 48:20.963
is being manipulated
and is constantly evolving.

48:22.933 --> 48:25.434
Our counter measures
should keep us safe.

48:28.205 --> 48:30.473
But, all in all...

48:31.741 --> 48:36.312
This place was meant to sustain
life for thousands of years.

48:42.986 --> 48:45.821
If it's adapting to us now,

48:47.290 --> 48:50.459
how was it adapted to before?

48:52.329 --> 48:55.197
Why was everyone
in such a rush to leave?

49:05.942 --> 49:08.511
We have to keep going
to find a signal.

49:10.280 --> 49:14.183
Tilly or Seagon might be
trying to communicate with us.

50:01.865 --> 50:03.332
That can't be right.

50:03.334 --> 50:04.700
Careful!

50:07.571 --> 50:09.872
That specimen contains enough
of the terminus virus

50:09.874 --> 50:12.107
to infect everyone
aboard this ship.

50:14.578 --> 50:17.313
Should've left you people
where we found you.

50:19.182 --> 50:22.451
You've almost jeopardized this
entire operation, Constance.

50:26.189 --> 50:28.591
If we don't approve phase 3,

50:28.593 --> 50:31.927
how can we fully understand
our next steps?

50:33.063 --> 50:36.232
I will tell you
what our next steps are,

50:36.234 --> 50:38.601
and that starts
with you understanding

50:38.603 --> 50:41.170
that I am the chief
medical engineer.

50:43.039 --> 50:44.607
It really plays to
have your recommendation

50:44.609 --> 50:46.642
at the board to observe.

50:48.411 --> 50:52.748
It is not attacking
the immune system of the host.

50:52.750 --> 50:55.684
Why would a virus want
to preserve the cells of a host?

50:55.686 --> 50:57.286
You saw it yourself.

50:58.688 --> 51:00.356
We don't know what we saw.

51:01.391 --> 51:03.926
But if you're as bright
as they say you are,

51:03.928 --> 51:06.362
you'll say the same when you're
brought before the council.

51:11.067 --> 51:12.534
Think about it.

51:13.970 --> 51:15.704
Keeping the hosts alive?

51:19.943 --> 51:22.411
Terminus' behavioral
patterns are-

51:22.413 --> 51:25.381
are anything but consistent with

51:25.383 --> 51:28.117
with what we know
those of a virus to be.

51:29.653 --> 51:32.221
And the readings
of the specimen.

51:32.223 --> 51:34.290
What are you suggesting?

51:36.126 --> 51:37.826
Human trials.

51:41.898 --> 51:45.267
We start with someone
no one would think to look for.

51:45.269 --> 51:46.468
Low level.

51:47.937 --> 51:49.004
Phase 3.

51:50.507 --> 51:54.843
We have to see the effects of
terminus from beginning to end.

51:54.845 --> 51:56.045
No.

51:57.447 --> 51:58.714
No.

52:00.183 --> 52:02.818
But this... the sample,
there's no other way.

52:02.820 --> 52:04.753
No, I said no!

52:06.956 --> 52:08.390
Now go.

52:08.925 --> 52:10.526
File the report.

52:15.265 --> 52:18.133
Consider this your reassignment.

52:18.135 --> 52:20.169
I will alert the viceroy.

52:21.104 --> 52:23.472
You will no longer to be
a part of my service.

52:23.474 --> 52:25.441
E effective immediately.

52:44.494 --> 52:49.198
I think it's best that we not
speak of what's transpired here.

52:49.200 --> 52:50.699
For both our sakes.

52:51.801 --> 52:53.335
What? What are you doing?

52:53.337 --> 53:00.409
Let me out!

53:08.486 --> 53:09.818
What?!

53:09.820 --> 53:11.019
What are you...

53:11.021 --> 53:12.821
What are you doing?!

53:13.590 --> 53:15.224
Let me out!

53:15.226 --> 53:17.192
What are you doing?

53:17.194 --> 53:18.293
Constance?

53:20.930 --> 53:21.997
Oh...

53:22.432 --> 53:23.599
My god.

53:23.601 --> 53:25.868
What are you-
what are you doing?

53:25.870 --> 53:27.169
Let me out.

53:28.571 --> 53:29.571
Constance.

53:30.173 --> 53:32.274
Afraid I can't do that.

53:32.909 --> 53:35.344
Constance, let me out.

53:37.013 --> 53:38.781
You're infected now.

54:35.805 --> 54:38.974
Subjects maintain
no cognitive response.

54:41.411 --> 54:43.579
Terminus has evolved.

54:44.013 --> 54:46.515
Life probability:

54:47.150 --> 54:49.017
Ten percent.

54:57.093 --> 54:58.861
I recommend...

55:00.363 --> 55:01.730
Phase 4.

58:27.704 --> 58:29.905
This is strange.

58:29.907 --> 58:32.040
The atmosphere is different.

58:32.042 --> 58:35.744
All the elements needed
for incubation is present.

58:44.387 --> 58:48.156
Detecting large quantities
of dark matter nearby.

58:56.866 --> 58:59.101
Now is a good time to remind you

58:59.103 --> 59:02.270
that your suit
capacity is at 5%.

59:41.978 --> 59:43.945
Is there power?

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:23.185
No.

01:00:24.921 --> 01:00:27.522
Actuals are unresponsive.

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:34.095
How is that possible?

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:42.437
There isn't any
power to the hardline.

01:00:42.439 --> 01:00:43.839
And without it,

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:48.844
without it we won't
be able to get a signal.

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:09.297
We have to get above ground.

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:21.810
I'll go.

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:29.084
You stay here in case
something changes.

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:25.140
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

01:03:35.344 --> 01:03:37.612
That doesn't make any sense.

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:46.821
Well, if you were afraid
of storms changing over,

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:52.060
or the surface loss of
life-sustaining elements

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:54.129
where would you go?

01:03:54.131 --> 01:03:56.097
If you were life on this planet?

01:03:58.034 --> 01:03:59.534
To live?

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.142
To survive.

01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:05.667
Ah!

01:05:30.226 --> 01:05:32.060
Only one of us has to live.

01:06:28.317 --> 01:06:29.551
Zan,

01:06:29.553 --> 01:06:32.320
artificial a.I.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:36.057
I am rerouting my energy source

01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:39.093
into your suit's modular

01:06:39.828 --> 01:06:42.597
good luck, Zan Desai.

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:45.400
Of the eternals.

01:11:54.309 --> 01:11:56.277
This is where you are made.

01:11:57.379 --> 01:11:59.547
This is where you begin.

01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:08.249
Zan.

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.652
My big girl.

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.630
Are you... are you sick?

01:13:29.237 --> 01:13:31.973
I want you to
do something for me.

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.526
When I was a little girl,

01:13:53.395 --> 01:13:57.665
my mother told me
about the... the time

01:13:57.667 --> 01:14:01.302
when the lands were
as green as emeralds,

01:14:04.673 --> 01:14:06.641
and the oceans...

01:14:08.243 --> 01:14:10.811
Were as blue as the sky.

01:14:15.417 --> 01:14:21.322
Before the terminus
tumbled the last man city,

01:14:25.761 --> 01:14:29.163
my mother gave up her ration

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:36.003
so she can always have
a piece of this ring.

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:43.511
And always have a home for me.

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.753
And now...

01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:55.790
I want you to keep it safe.

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:01.796
And hold on to it for me.

01:15:03.165 --> 01:15:05.032
Can you do that?

01:15:09.638 --> 01:15:10.938
Yes.

01:15:11.339 --> 01:15:12.406
Yes.

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:14.141
I will.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:19.080
I want you to
take care of yourself.

01:15:22.984 --> 01:15:25.019
I am always with you,

01:15:25.021 --> 01:15:26.454
wherever you are.

01:15:27.989 --> 01:15:29.724
But, mommy.

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:31.559
Please don't go.

01:15:33.695 --> 01:15:35.096
A land...

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:36.797
As green as emeralds.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:38.899
The ocean...

01:15:39.534 --> 01:15:40.835
As blue as the sky.

01:15:42.838 --> 01:15:43.838
A land...

01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:47.074
As green as emeralds.

01:15:47.776 --> 01:15:49.243
The ocean...

01:15:49.878 --> 01:15:51.512
As blue as the sky.

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:17.171
It's time.
