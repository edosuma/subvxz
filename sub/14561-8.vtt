WEBVTT

00:03.971 --> 00:07.141
* Whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo-whoo

00:07.175 --> 00:10.111
* Whoo-hoo-hoo...

00:10.144 --> 00:11.412
CHARLIE:
In pursuit-evasion,

00:11.445 --> 00:14.448
one group tries to track down
members of another.

00:14.482 --> 00:16.784
DON:
You just kicked in the door.

00:16.817 --> 00:19.253
You're looking
for a third striker.

00:19.287 --> 00:20.688
Let's say you're the pursuer,

00:20.721 --> 00:23.091
and you occupy the same
node as your evader.

00:23.124 --> 00:25.293
He's captured and removed.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.262
However, if your evader
can find a way

00:28.296 --> 00:31.465
to outmaneuver you, he escapes.

00:31.499 --> 00:33.701
(dog barking)

00:35.603 --> 00:37.571
The goal here is to gain
an advantage over your opponent

00:37.605 --> 00:41.075
by changing the movement rules
using variants.

00:41.109 --> 00:42.143
DON:
A K-9 team.

00:42.176 --> 00:44.078
(dog barks, students laugh)

00:44.112 --> 00:46.614
Or you could change
the edge weight.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.848
Get air support.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.084
What if the K-9 team is busy,

00:50.118 --> 00:52.386
the chopper's down for repairs,
and backup is 20 minutes out?

00:52.420 --> 00:54.155
What's pursuit-evasion say,
then?

00:54.188 --> 00:56.157
Let's look at fish.

00:56.190 --> 00:59.460
When fish sense disturbances
around them,

00:59.493 --> 01:03.831
they go into a defensive reflex
called a C-start.

01:03.864 --> 01:08.169
* Whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo-whoo

01:08.202 --> 01:09.437
* Whoo-hoo-hoo...

01:09.470 --> 01:12.140
(panting)

01:12.173 --> 01:13.874
The snake has found a way

01:13.907 --> 01:16.110
to introduce a variant
into the game.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.379
As the fish approaches,

01:18.412 --> 01:20.214
the snake ripples its body
toward the fish,

01:20.248 --> 01:24.118
which sends the fish off
in the opposite direction.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.186
(panting)

01:25.219 --> 01:28.356
You see, the snake anticipates
and then executes

01:28.389 --> 01:30.124
a predictive strike

01:30.158 --> 01:32.793
aimed at where
the fish will end up.

01:32.826 --> 01:34.728
(dog barking)

01:34.762 --> 01:37.165
* Unusual fools...

01:39.533 --> 01:40.368
Know your opponent.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.370
Is he a runner,
has he got any priors,

01:42.403 --> 01:44.205
is he injured,
is he gonna roll over,

01:44.238 --> 01:45.573
is he gonna try
to shoot it out with us?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.241
It's a game.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.342
Control it.

01:48.376 --> 01:50.211
I swear I didn't know
it was you.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.545
You don't want me.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.214
I'm not worth the trouble.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.382
Oh, no.

01:54.415 --> 01:55.616
It's not mine.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.285
Just carrying for a friend.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.452
Your friend Felipe Garcia?

01:58.486 --> 02:00.254
Who?

02:00.288 --> 02:03.291
Lie to your girlfriend when
she asks if you love her,

02:03.324 --> 02:04.892
but don't lie to me. Here.

02:06.427 --> 02:09.230
Last I heard,
Garcia was serving two years.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.831
Yeah? Last I heard, he escaped.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.366
You called him the day before.

02:12.400 --> 02:15.169
I rat him out,
I'm in the obits tomorrow.

02:15.203 --> 02:17.805
(gasps)

02:17.838 --> 02:19.940
This is Whisky 33. I need a unit

02:19.973 --> 02:21.309
at Wilshire and Bixel.

02:21.342 --> 02:22.576
Just give me two hours.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.178
I'll see what I can find out.
(chuckles)

02:24.212 --> 02:26.447
Do I look like I just got hit
by the stupid stick?

02:26.480 --> 02:28.816
I screw with you,
I know what happens--

02:28.849 --> 02:30.718
- I go to jail.
- In an ambulance.

02:34.722 --> 02:37.791
Hour 59. Get going.

02:39.960 --> 02:41.462
Ticktock!

02:41.495 --> 02:42.796
NIKKI:
So the snake just

02:42.830 --> 02:44.332
sits around all day
and gets fat?

02:44.365 --> 02:45.566
Hardly.

02:45.599 --> 02:46.900
If the snake gets

02:46.934 --> 02:49.703
too preoccupied with
chasing that fish...

02:49.737 --> 02:53.474
he could very easily become
someone else's dinner.

03:09.457 --> 03:10.624
Rise and shine.

03:12.826 --> 03:16.764
* Refuse these cruel

03:16.797 --> 03:21.001
* Unusual fools

03:21.034 --> 03:26.474
* Leave them to rule
in hollowpoint hell *

03:26.507 --> 03:28.842
(exhaling)
* Help

03:28.876 --> 03:30.444
(exhaling)

03:32.646 --> 03:35.749
(siren wailing)

03:35.783 --> 03:39.019
(tires screech, siren stops)

03:39.052 --> 03:40.020
Hands in the air!

03:40.053 --> 03:41.355
All right, take it easy.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.456
Hands in the air!

03:42.490 --> 03:45.025
Lock your fingers
behind your head.

03:45.058 --> 03:50.298
* Whoo-hoo-hoo,
whoo-whoo-whoo... *

03:50.331 --> 03:51.765
Gun!

03:51.799 --> 03:53.334
Yeah, I'm an FBI agent.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.605
You are under arrest

03:57.638 --> 03:58.972
for the murder
of Vincent Costello.

03:59.006 --> 04:00.341
Are you listening to me?

04:00.374 --> 04:01.842
The same guy signs
both our checks.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.010
I'm Agent Ian Edgerton.

04:03.043 --> 04:04.878
You have the right
to remain silent.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.780
Anything you say can
and will be used

04:06.814 --> 04:08.416
against you in a court of law.

04:08.449 --> 04:11.419
All right, do me a favor:
Call Don Eppes over at the FBI.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.654
* Whoo-hoo-hoo

04:14.755 --> 04:19.059
* Whoo-hoo-hoo, whoo-whoo

04:19.092 --> 04:21.028
* Whoo-hoo-hoo...

04:26.434 --> 04:28.702
Prison is where
convicted felons go.

04:28.736 --> 04:29.903
Aren't we skipping a step?

04:29.937 --> 04:31.772
Detention centers
are overcrowded.

04:31.805 --> 04:32.906
This will give you a chance
to catch up

04:32.940 --> 04:34.575
with some of your old friends.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.377
You know,
the guys you put away for life.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.812
DON:
Ian, do you know this guy?

04:41.549 --> 04:43.451
Xavier Salazar,

04:43.484 --> 04:46.887
top-ten FBI most-wanted list,
2000 to 2005.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.022
I arrested him
in Bogota, Colombia.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.991
He's currently serving
a life sentence right here.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.093
Salazar's been running a massive
heroin ring from inside.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.063
Ooh! It's true what they say
about a broken watch

04:56.096 --> 04:57.698
telling the right time
twice a day.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.066
You've been helping him,

04:59.099 --> 05:00.901
letting key associates of his
run free.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.637
Yeah, of course I have.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.506
Half a million dollars
in an offshore account

05:05.539 --> 05:06.774
with your name on it.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.008
Transfers came from several

05:08.041 --> 05:09.910
of Salazar's holding companies.

05:13.914 --> 05:15.383
I'm being set up.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.052
Costello was gonna give you up,

05:19.086 --> 05:20.488
so you killed him.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.089
(chuckling):
News flash--

05:22.122 --> 05:24.091
the Easter Bunny,
he's not real either.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.959
They found this in a sewer
about a block away

05:25.993 --> 05:27.361
from where Costello was killed.

05:31.499 --> 05:32.866
Someone must have stolen it
from my apartment.

05:32.900 --> 05:33.934
We searched your place, Ian.
There was no sign

05:33.967 --> 05:35.803
- of forced entry.
- Well, then I must be guilty.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.037
DON:
Why were you meeting him?

05:37.070 --> 05:39.139
We've been trying to
shut down Salazar, too.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.042
The key is his bookkeeper,
Felipe Garcia.

05:42.075 --> 05:44.077
Garcia escaped from here
a month ago.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.579
Costello was ready to give me
Garcia's location.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.681
Salazar must have found out
and had him killed.

05:47.715 --> 05:48.816
Costello left me a clue:

05:48.849 --> 05:51.519
B-17; it's a location.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.454
B block, 17th cell.
I don't think

05:53.487 --> 05:55.055
Garcia ever left here.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.991
It's impossible. Every prisoner
in here gets an I.D. bracelet

05:58.025 --> 06:00.961
like that,
just like at a hospital.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.930
Gets scanned once a day.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.999
If Garcia's here,
he'd have shown up by now.

06:09.437 --> 06:12.039
Have you ever known
my instincts to be wrong?

06:22.916 --> 06:24.985
I'm ready to go back to my cell.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.420
(handcuffs tightening)

06:32.593 --> 06:34.061
(metal door slamming)

06:34.094 --> 06:36.730
(inmate chattering indistinctly)

06:40.233 --> 06:42.503
I'm betting I can
crack his windpipe

06:42.536 --> 06:44.104
before you hit that button.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.873
(strained):
Listen to him.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.141
Give me the keys... now!

06:50.944 --> 06:51.945
Hey.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.214
Edgerton may be the
FBI's top fugitive hunter,

06:54.247 --> 06:56.083
but a social butterfly
the man is not.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.851
Last 12 hours,
he's made no phone calls,

06:57.885 --> 06:59.186
went to the movies
by himself.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.688
I mean, he's gonna kill a guy
with his own knife

07:00.721 --> 07:02.756
and dumps it a block away?

07:02.790 --> 07:03.624
(alarm sounds)

07:03.657 --> 07:04.324
MAN (on P.A.):
Attention all personnel.

07:04.357 --> 07:06.527
Prison is now in lockdown mode.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.463
Attention all personnel.
Prison is now in lockdown mode.

07:09.497 --> 07:11.465
He took the 2,000 hallway
to the south ramp.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.801
He's on the roof. Go! Go!

07:13.834 --> 07:15.035
Phillips! Get these off me.

07:30.718 --> 07:32.119
Nothing. David?

07:36.524 --> 07:37.891
Nothing!

07:37.925 --> 07:39.059
Colby?

07:39.092 --> 07:41.128
Nothing but daylight.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.596
Edgerton is good,
but I don't think

07:42.630 --> 07:43.764
he can make himself invisible.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.198
All right. We need to get

07:45.232 --> 07:46.867
the security footage
from Thompson.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.135
We need to look at all
escape routes, right?

07:48.168 --> 07:50.971
And he said something
about block B-17.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.873
So find out who's housed there.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.810
I know Edgerton's a risk taker,
but escaping from here,

07:56.844 --> 07:59.279
that's a long shot,
even for him.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.683
(indistinct chatter)

08:07.254 --> 08:09.657
Only place that ramp leads
is the roof.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.724
Any cameras up there?

08:10.758 --> 08:12.092
Edgerton broke the cable.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.161
Your guy knows how
to get himself lost in a hurry,

08:14.194 --> 08:15.162
I'll give him that.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.229
He's been hunting
fugitives his whole life.

08:16.263 --> 08:18.298
If he wants to stay lost,
guy's gonna stay lost.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.300
Hope you don't mind
if I disagree

08:20.333 --> 08:21.835
with that last statement.

08:21.869 --> 08:22.936
Janet Galvin, team leader,

08:22.970 --> 08:24.738
Pacific Fugitive
Apprehension Squad.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.940
You have Edgerton. I have her.

08:26.974 --> 08:28.275
Your boy's got all the classic

08:28.308 --> 08:29.209
pathological behavior
of a felon.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.178
- Really?
- Loner, not much supervision,

08:31.211 --> 08:32.946
never sleeps in the same spot
two nights in a row.

08:32.980 --> 08:35.015
Doesn't take much
for an individual like that

08:35.048 --> 08:36.249
to flip to the dark side.

08:36.283 --> 08:37.985
Dark side?

08:38.018 --> 08:40.554
I've seen it before.

08:40.588 --> 08:43.290
Spend your life watching
bad guys wearing $2,000 suits,

08:43.323 --> 08:45.258
driving Ferraris, a
beautiful woman on their arm.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.294
Only so many cheeseburgers
a man can eat

08:47.327 --> 08:48.796
before he wants
a piece of filet.

08:48.829 --> 08:51.064
Well, he's more
of a venison man,

08:51.098 --> 08:53.133
and he likes to kill
his own dinner.

08:53.166 --> 08:55.603
This is probably hard for you.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.872
The one's closest are usually
the last to find out.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.341
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a fugitive to hunt.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.044
Marshals have jurisdiction

09:04.077 --> 09:06.346
inside a prison, which means
this is my operation.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.281
Of course, we'll keep
you apprised

09:08.315 --> 09:10.117
if we find anything out;
I expect the same in return.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.051
Sure.

09:14.054 --> 09:18.692
So, Garcia was never inside
cell block B-17.

09:18.726 --> 09:22.162
Making nice with the new kids
on the playground?

09:22.195 --> 09:25.232
I'm trying, but I think they
just took our football away.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.101
REPORTER: He is one of their
own; Special Agent Ian Edgerton,

09:28.135 --> 09:29.369
who is believed to be
the suspect

09:29.402 --> 09:31.338
in the murder
of Vincent Costello.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.706
Costello was a career criminal

09:32.740 --> 09:34.141
who was stabbed to death
last night.

09:34.174 --> 09:35.909
Now, what Edgerton's
possible motive...

09:35.943 --> 09:38.311
Now I know what
my brother means when he says,

09:38.345 --> 09:40.380
"The only easy day
was yesterday."

09:40.413 --> 09:43.617
(Charlie sighs)

09:43.651 --> 09:45.619
Murder suspect,
wanted fugitive.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.921
That's just not the Ian Edgerton
I know.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.290
Tell me about it.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.992
Where I grew up, in East L.A.,

09:52.025 --> 09:54.728
dating bad guys meant
dating bad guys.

09:54.762 --> 09:56.664
Hell, my prom date held up
the flower shop

09:56.697 --> 09:57.898
he got my corsage from.

09:57.931 --> 10:00.067
- Wow.
- Ian...

10:00.100 --> 10:01.735
is not those guys.

10:01.769 --> 10:03.103
You know what Einstein said?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.204
"A man should look

10:04.237 --> 10:07.641
for what is and not for
what he thinks should be."

10:07.675 --> 10:09.176
I'm looking,
but I'm still not believing

10:09.209 --> 10:10.911
what I'm seeing.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.414
What's your pursuit-evasion say
about this?

10:14.447 --> 10:16.349
Oh, that all logic
goes out the window.

10:16.383 --> 10:18.852
When a snake hunting
another snake?

10:18.886 --> 10:21.421
Actually, no.
Game theory tells us

10:21.454 --> 10:23.390
that if someone's feeling
unfairly wronged,

10:23.423 --> 10:26.393
like Ian, their response
is rarely logical.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.328
You know what? Here.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.263
Check it out.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.934
Here's a hundred dollars.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.404
So let's say a stranger tells
you to divide that

10:37.437 --> 10:39.339
between the two of us
however you want.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.046
(chuckles) $30?

10:46.079 --> 10:47.247
- Really?
- No offense,

10:47.280 --> 10:49.883
but my 401(k) and the economy
aren't seeing eye to eye.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.686
Okay, well, according
to the ultimatum game,

10:52.720 --> 10:54.354
I can either accept
or reject this offer.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.323
If I reject it,
neither of us get anything.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.858
But I'm gonna reject it anyway,

10:57.891 --> 10:59.326
because if you're
not gonna offer

10:59.359 --> 11:01.361
me 50-50,
I'm not taking it.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.363
You're turning down free money
because you want to punish me?

11:03.396 --> 11:07.434
People have a tremendous
desire for revenge,

11:07.467 --> 11:10.771
even if it's at the risk
of hurting themselves.

11:12.072 --> 11:15.342
So Ian's goal isn't to escape,

11:15.375 --> 11:17.911
it's to punish someone.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.253
It's a four-story drop--
if Edgerton jumped,

11:26.286 --> 11:28.155
there'd be plenty of evidence
for us to find.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.858
I don't get it, where
the hell is the guy?

11:30.891 --> 11:32.192
My best guess:
the elevator shaft.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.394
Might've rode down
on the top of one of the cars

11:34.427 --> 11:36.029
and snuck out
on a different level.

11:36.063 --> 11:37.130
GALVIN:
My boys already cleared this.

11:37.164 --> 11:39.332
I guess you didn't see
the yellow crime scene tape.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.201
I need to remind you
who's running this operation?

11:41.234 --> 11:42.870
Well, I guess it would be you--

11:42.903 --> 11:44.171
you got the nice,
laminated map here, right?

11:44.204 --> 11:45.739
Look at this, Colby.

11:45.773 --> 11:47.507
It's got all these colors;
much nicer than ours.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.876
It's all yours.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.210
This actually is a lot
better than ours.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.245
What's with all this
extra detail?

11:52.279 --> 11:54.782
Prison underwent an earthquake
retrofitting a few years back.

11:54.815 --> 11:57.084
This shows the before and after.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.218
Look at this right here.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.520
There's an access hatch
in that vent.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.756
It was covered over, looks like,
during the renovation.

12:02.790 --> 12:05.292
Well, I guess your boys
missed this, huh?

12:05.325 --> 12:07.427
How would Edgerton
even know about that?

12:07.460 --> 12:11.298
'Cause he's been bringing
prisoners here for 20 years.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.332
(grunts)

12:16.236 --> 12:18.071
Well, take a look at this.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.778
Guess we don't need a DNA test
to tell us whose this is.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.220
(sighs)

12:33.253 --> 12:34.487
He's not in here.

12:34.521 --> 12:37.290
DAVID:
Section 5A is clear.

12:37.324 --> 12:40.193
How is this sitting with you?

12:41.328 --> 12:43.864
Ian and I went
to a Dodgers game,

12:43.897 --> 12:45.532
not a chapel in Vegas.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.200
I can still do my job.

12:47.234 --> 12:50.137
I was asking for your
insight as an FBI agent.

12:52.272 --> 12:54.908
Things aren't looking
too good for him.

12:54.942 --> 12:58.411
Three of Ian's CIs
were drug runners for Salazar.

12:58.445 --> 13:01.014
The most useful CIs
are usually the dirtiest ones.

13:01.048 --> 13:03.350
That's why they have
the good information.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.318
I was LAPD during Rampart.

13:05.352 --> 13:07.554
Some of the best cops
I knew went down.

13:09.356 --> 13:13.927
So Ian is the last person I
would expect to be on the take.

13:19.366 --> 13:21.434
Marshals said
they covered about 60%

13:21.468 --> 13:24.204
of the rooms connected
to the air vent.

13:24.237 --> 13:25.805
Here we go.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.276
(door opens)

13:34.514 --> 13:36.049
(brief clatter in distance)

13:50.097 --> 13:52.465
(low, mechanical humming)

13:52.499 --> 13:54.267
It's nothing.

13:57.337 --> 14:00.307
(grunting)

14:00.340 --> 14:01.174
(alarm ringing)

14:01.208 --> 14:02.375
All right, all right, take it
easy!

14:02.409 --> 14:03.310
COLBY: Don, you need to take
the shot, you just take it.

14:03.343 --> 14:04.011
Too late, you should've
shot right away--

14:04.044 --> 14:05.979
now you're thinking too much.

14:06.013 --> 14:06.779
That's when you make mistakes.

14:06.813 --> 14:07.981
I thought
you were innocent, Ian.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.249
- I am.
- Yeah, I can see that.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.952
Don't let him get in your head,
Don, you do what you need to do.

14:11.985 --> 14:13.353
- GALVIN: I've got him.
- I've seen you shoot, Galvin--

14:13.386 --> 14:14.454
you're not that good.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.123
He's not gonna hurt Colby.

14:16.156 --> 14:18.091
He knows he'd be dead
one second later.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.292
Yeah, then go ahead
and pull the trigger, Sinclair--

14:19.326 --> 14:21.028
kill your own partner.

14:22.129 --> 14:24.631
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

14:24.664 --> 14:26.333
There's a way out of this.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.438
Looks like we've got ourselves
an honest-to-God

14:31.471 --> 14:33.140
Mexican standoff--
who's blinking first?

14:33.173 --> 14:35.575
You want to die, fine by me.

14:35.608 --> 14:39.479
It's your decision, Don--
you know what I'm capable of.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.648
Eppes, don't back down.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.452
All right, David, get them out.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.154
Get out. Get out!

14:47.187 --> 14:50.090
- Come on, move. Up.
- Let's go, move! Let's go.

14:52.559 --> 14:54.361
What the hell

14:54.394 --> 14:56.529
- do you think you're doing?
- Trying to save a life.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.932
Look, we all want the same thing
here, okay? So back off.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.200
THOMPSON:
Set up a CP. Deploy SWAT.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.601
DAVID:
Slow your roll, okay?

15:01.634 --> 15:03.436
Listen, there's an
FBI agent inside there.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.038
We are taking tactical command.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.707
This is a United States
penitentiary, my turf.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.708
DON:
Hey.

15:08.741 --> 15:09.977
We're handling negotiations.

15:11.111 --> 15:12.479
Fine. It's your guy's neck

15:12.512 --> 15:14.147
on the line in there.

15:14.181 --> 15:15.382
You do the talking.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.117
For now.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.519
What happened in there?

15:19.552 --> 15:21.688
I had a shot,
and I didn't take it.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.623
Don, come on, talk to me.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.492
Look, I need some time.

15:25.525 --> 15:26.659
Just... you're in charge.

15:32.565 --> 15:35.035
Let me be clear about something.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.070
(grunts)

15:37.104 --> 15:39.006
The FBI...

15:39.039 --> 15:40.373
the marshals...

15:40.407 --> 15:42.375
they put me in this situation.

15:42.409 --> 15:43.576
COLBY:
Ian... (scoffs)

15:43.610 --> 15:45.412
I always knew
you were a nine ball,

15:45.445 --> 15:46.579
but, you know, I considered
your track record,

15:46.613 --> 15:48.348
I figured it was okay.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.185
Let me ask you something.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.686
How many HRTs you been on?

15:56.323 --> 15:57.657
Fifty-seven.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.394
And how many times did
the perp wind up in jail?

16:01.428 --> 16:03.030
Forty-one.

16:03.063 --> 16:06.733
What happened the other
16 times, Ian?

16:06.766 --> 16:08.968
(sighs)

16:10.103 --> 16:13.106
I had to clean my gun
when I got home.

16:17.244 --> 16:19.412
There's two things you got to
understand about me, Granger.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.548
Number one,
I didn't kill Costello.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.183
And two?

16:23.216 --> 16:24.517
There's no way
I'm going to jail.

16:24.551 --> 16:27.120
I hate to be the one
to break this to you,

16:27.154 --> 16:28.321
but you're already here.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.430
You're hardwired in.

16:41.601 --> 16:44.204
- Here we go.
- Hey, Ian...

16:44.237 --> 16:46.139
told me that he
sometimes gets down

16:46.173 --> 16:47.407
when he's not out on a hunt.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.476
I didn't think much
of it at the time,

16:49.509 --> 16:51.578
but... now I don't know.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.713
Maybe it means something.

16:53.746 --> 16:55.482
Okay.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.420
(phone line ringing)

17:01.554 --> 17:04.591
(phone ringing)

17:08.861 --> 17:10.663
I'll keep it simple.

17:10.697 --> 17:14.667
G5 fueled on the tarmac at LAX
and a Beatles reunion.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.803
DAVID (on phone):
I want to know what I have to do

17:16.836 --> 17:18.538
to get my partner
out of there safely.

17:18.571 --> 17:20.140
There's only Paul and Ringo--
shouldn't be too hard.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.007
Yeah, you want to play around?

17:21.040 --> 17:23.476
I got 20 marshals
out here, itching

17:23.510 --> 17:24.644
to turn this into a bloodbath,

17:24.677 --> 17:26.479
- okay?
- Get me Professor Eppes

17:26.513 --> 17:28.481
on a video feed
in the next 20 minutes.

17:28.515 --> 17:29.482
I need to know that Colby

17:29.516 --> 17:31.151
- is all right.
- He's fine.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.652
And as long as no one
does anything stupid,

17:32.685 --> 17:34.487
like a crisis entry,
which I'm sure

17:34.521 --> 17:35.555
the marshals are pushing for,

17:35.588 --> 17:36.556
he'll stay that way.

17:38.825 --> 17:40.360
Phone.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.828
Talk.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.630
Ian...

17:43.663 --> 17:45.398
(on phone):
it's me.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.638
Betancourt, it's been a while
since I've heard your voice.

17:51.671 --> 17:52.705
Yeah, well, you stopped calling.

17:52.739 --> 17:54.607
Yeah, uh...

17:54.641 --> 17:56.509
fugitive hunt
in the Abajo Mountains.

17:56.543 --> 17:58.145
Cell phone service
really sucked.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.552
Back out on the hunt.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.520
That must've made you happy.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.556
I'll tell you
what will make me happy,

18:09.589 --> 18:11.591
is to have my friends trust me.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.592
NIKKI:
Yeah, we do.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.327
I do.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.696
Really? That's why you
keep me on the phone,

18:16.729 --> 18:17.764
so the marshals can find

18:17.797 --> 18:18.765
a way to take me out!

18:18.798 --> 18:20.167
Taking Colby hostage

18:20.200 --> 18:21.534
is not gonna help your case.

18:21.568 --> 18:23.270
If you're innocent,
we'll prove it.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.872
I spent my career putting my ass
on the line, thinking

18:25.905 --> 18:28.208
it'll make a difference, and
how does the Bureau repay me?

18:28.241 --> 18:29.242
By putting me behind bars!

18:29.276 --> 18:31.778
By believing scum like Salazar!

18:31.811 --> 18:33.313
No one's convicted you
of anything yet.

18:33.346 --> 18:34.247
Yeah, sure they haven't.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.916
If Charlie's not
on my computer screen

18:36.949 --> 18:39.652
in the next 19 minutes, it's
gonna get real messy in here.

18:51.298 --> 18:53.633
- Basic rules...
- Prolong the situation,

18:53.666 --> 18:55.235
ensure the safety
of the hostages,

18:55.268 --> 18:56.336
and, um, to...

18:56.369 --> 18:57.904
- Keep...
- To keep things calm.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.739
DON:
Right.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.475
I think I've got it down.

19:02.509 --> 19:04.644
Okay. I mean, he's going
to try to test you,

19:04.677 --> 19:05.645
you know, with...
with unreasonable demands.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.847
And I thought synthetic
differential geometry

19:07.880 --> 19:08.948
was confusing.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.183
All right. This is Eppes.

19:10.217 --> 19:11.351
I got him. Patch us through.

19:12.552 --> 19:14.254
Hey, Ian?

19:20.560 --> 19:22.329
Sorry to drag you
into this, Professor,

19:22.362 --> 19:23.596
but I need your skills.

19:24.764 --> 19:25.865
Uh...

19:25.898 --> 19:28.235
listen, I need to ask you
about Colby.

19:28.268 --> 19:29.736
How is he doing?

19:29.769 --> 19:30.570
Here.

19:31.871 --> 19:33.373
Everything's going
to be fine, Charlie.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.542
Just listen to what he has
to say, all right?

19:35.575 --> 19:36.709
Satisfied?

19:36.743 --> 19:38.611
Uh, yeah, and, uh,

19:38.645 --> 19:39.712
how are...
how are you doing, Ian?

19:39.746 --> 19:41.348
Oh, fine, except for the fact

19:41.381 --> 19:42.749
that I've been set up
for a murder

19:42.782 --> 19:44.251
I didn't commit,
and I'm looking at a trip

19:44.284 --> 19:45.452
to the death chamber.
How about you?

19:45.485 --> 19:47.587
Surprisingly nervous.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.356
Find your Zen quickly.

19:49.389 --> 19:51.591
You're the only one
who can help me out here.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.559
Salazar was afraid

19:52.592 --> 19:54.761
that Garcia was going to testify
against him,

19:54.794 --> 19:57.230
so he ordered him to be whacked,
but Garcia escaped

19:57.264 --> 19:58.931
- before the job got done.
- Escaped felons--

19:58.965 --> 20:00.567
isn't that what
they pay you to do?

20:00.600 --> 20:02.302
Ha!

20:03.736 --> 20:04.937
Outside, Garcia had nowhere

20:04.971 --> 20:06.639
to turn for money,
but Salazar's people.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.608
He wouldn't have lasted
ten minutes.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.344
But inside the jail--
that would be the perfect place

20:11.378 --> 20:13.746
for him hide until he could
talk to the cops

20:13.780 --> 20:14.881
and guarantee protection
for himself.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.849
You think Garcia is hiding
inside the prison system?

20:16.883 --> 20:18.017
Using someone else's identity.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.852
What I was trying
to tell your brother.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.561
The prisoners all wear
I.D. bracelets.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.731
Easy enough to get off.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.533
And once you do,
you're lost in the system.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.436
- How many prisoners are there?
- 6,000.

20:36.469 --> 20:39.372
Okay, now I understand
why you called me.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.809
You're talking about a
longitudinal socializing process

20:42.842 --> 20:45.878
as it applies
to the prison population.

20:45.912 --> 20:46.979
Sounds complex.

20:47.013 --> 20:48.014
It's very.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.749
Well, hopefully not too complex,

20:49.782 --> 20:52.952
because Colby's really counting
on you to get the right answer.

21:04.464 --> 21:05.998
Edgerton seems pretty confident

21:06.032 --> 21:08.000
that Garcia
is still in the system.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.536
And what do we have
on the escape?

21:09.569 --> 21:11.371
Well, marshals found this

21:11.404 --> 21:13.005
in the exercise yard.

21:13.039 --> 21:15.007
Did a cell check ten minutes
later-- Garcia was gone.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.076
So, what actual proof
do we have that he left?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.379
This...
(tapping keys)

21:19.412 --> 21:21.881
is a video
of visitors leaving the jail

21:21.914 --> 21:23.516
before it was locked down.

21:23.550 --> 21:24.784
Now, those two were cleared.

21:24.817 --> 21:25.585
(typing)

21:25.618 --> 21:27.987
Marshals think this...
is Garcia.

21:28.020 --> 21:30.022
See, his pants are short.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.324
They figured he got clothes
from the lawyer,

21:31.358 --> 21:32.359
but the size was off.

21:32.392 --> 21:33.460
Yeah, wait, wait.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.728
Look at this.
Says he's a righty.

21:35.762 --> 21:36.829
This guy's opened the door
with his left hand.

21:36.863 --> 21:40.900
Okay, Charlie, you're
looking at 6,000 prisoners.

21:42.034 --> 21:43.035
Maybe not.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.637
Garcia lived in a specific cell,

21:44.671 --> 21:46.706
which means he was only exposed
to a portion

21:46.739 --> 21:48.107
of the prison population
each day.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.076
Still, it's got to be
a thousand people.

21:50.109 --> 21:51.478
We don't have time
to interview them all.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.381
Well, with longitudinal
socializing process,

21:54.414 --> 21:55.548
we may not have to.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.016
Detention facilities
are breeding ground

21:57.049 --> 21:58.818
for criminal enterprises,
aren't they?

21:58.851 --> 22:00.620
And that's going to help us...?

22:00.653 --> 22:02.389
It's like the TV show Survivor,

22:02.422 --> 22:04.924
where every contestant
is assigned to a tribe

22:04.957 --> 22:07.093
and each player competes
in challenges.

22:07.126 --> 22:09.462
The players have to use
their individual skills

22:09.496 --> 22:10.997
in order
for the tribe to succeed,

22:11.030 --> 22:12.932
so that when they go
to the Tribal Council,

22:12.965 --> 22:15.735
if they've built
their alliances correctly,

22:15.768 --> 22:16.969
they survive.

22:17.003 --> 22:18.371
Jails aren't
that much different.

22:18.405 --> 22:20.106
The networks
that are established in jails

22:20.139 --> 22:22.409
offer significant financial

22:22.442 --> 22:24.076
and logistical resources
to criminals.

22:24.110 --> 22:27.046
The petty thief blends his
skills with the gunrunner,

22:27.079 --> 22:29.649
or the accountant
who embezzled millions

22:29.682 --> 22:32.585
allies with the drug kingpin
who can launder his money.

22:32.619 --> 22:34.153
And so a longitudinal

22:34.186 --> 22:35.955
socializing process looks for

22:35.988 --> 22:38.491
the most beneficial patterns
in relationships.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.460
NIKKI:
Who Garcia would have had

22:40.493 --> 22:41.961
to build alliances with
in order to survive

22:41.994 --> 22:43.763
being whacked by Salazar.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.832
I can run data and narrow
down possible matches.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.934
But I need your help
in analyzing final candidates.

22:47.967 --> 22:48.935
Let's do it.

23:11.190 --> 23:13.793
Stale.

23:13.826 --> 23:17.430
Hey. I know how you can get
yourself a nice, hot pizza.

23:17.464 --> 23:20.600
Sorry, but you're worth
a little more to me than that.

23:23.102 --> 23:25.772
I could've gone for Eppes,

23:25.805 --> 23:27.640
but you know what it's like.

23:27.674 --> 23:29.609
I know what it's like, how?

23:29.642 --> 23:32.579
Everyone in the FBI thought
you were spying for the Chinese.

23:32.612 --> 23:35.114
The one man who could prove
your innocence was dead.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.649
I mean, hell, even your partner
thought you were guilty.

23:36.683 --> 23:39.819
This is nothing like
what I went through.

23:39.852 --> 23:43.122
If you're waiting on the
Stockholm syndrome to kick in,

23:43.155 --> 23:44.691
it's going to be a long night.

23:46.993 --> 23:48.528
If I get ahold of that gun,

23:48.561 --> 23:50.096
I won't hesitate
to take you out.

23:55.935 --> 23:58.137
Department of Corrections
just sent over Garcia's file.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.873
He was serving two years
for obstruction of justice.

24:00.907 --> 24:04.143
Wait. So he should have been
in minimum security.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.645
Yeah. Apparently,
Garcia thought so, too.

24:05.678 --> 24:07.714
He wrote multiple letters
to the prison board.

24:07.747 --> 24:09.516
Claimed his life was in danger.

24:09.549 --> 24:11.083
What, they just ignored it?

24:11.117 --> 24:13.019
No, they signed off
on several transfers.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.654
But each time,
the orders were rescinded

24:14.687 --> 24:16.055
at the very last minute.

24:16.088 --> 24:17.156
Well, why's that?

24:17.189 --> 24:20.560
That information's probably
available at the prison.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.929
Thought you might want
to get back in the game.

24:22.962 --> 24:25.231
Questioning my judgment?

24:25.264 --> 24:26.733
No.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.034
My own, maybe.

24:28.067 --> 24:28.968
Give yourself a break.

24:29.001 --> 24:32.204
You know, we might
turn out to be right.

24:32.238 --> 24:34.641
Is that why you
didn't take the shot?

24:36.042 --> 24:38.811
- You think he's innocent?
- I hope so.

24:40.279 --> 24:43.082
Don't worry.
Colby's in good hands.

24:46.285 --> 24:47.787
I just spoke with Don.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.689
He and Charlie are
narrowing down their list.

24:49.722 --> 24:51.724
I'm not going to sit around
and do nothing

24:51.758 --> 24:53.560
while your boy wonder
plays with his abacus.

24:53.593 --> 24:54.861
I'd like to probe the perimeter,

24:54.894 --> 24:56.629
see if I can't get a
camera under the door.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.898
Edgerton's a master
at tactics.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.567
He is going
to be expecting that.

25:00.600 --> 25:02.535
THOMPSON: This thing may not end
the way you want it to.

25:02.569 --> 25:03.970
We need to be ready.

25:04.003 --> 25:05.137
Look, it's a mistake.

25:05.171 --> 25:07.807
I'm not asking
your permission, Sinclair.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.876
Go.

25:32.331 --> 25:34.266
(Galvin yells,
Edgerton chuckles)

25:34.300 --> 25:36.068
Damn it! Pull back!

25:38.004 --> 25:38.938
(laughs)

25:41.340 --> 25:44.210
Eh, it was just a few volts.
Enough to send a message.

25:44.243 --> 25:46.278
Yeah? What message is that?

25:46.312 --> 25:49.582
"I'm a sociopath
who enjoys hurting people"?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.601
I always liked you, Granger.

26:08.635 --> 26:11.170
Served in the military,
not afraid to mix it up.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.141
We're not so different.

26:15.174 --> 26:16.876
Really?

26:16.909 --> 26:19.278
'Cause from where I'm sitting,
I'd say we are.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.915
Just the facts, ma'am, huh?

26:22.949 --> 26:24.316
Hmm.

26:24.350 --> 26:26.653
Dragnet.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.187
I used to love that show.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.756
It's what made me want
to become a cop.

26:29.789 --> 26:31.123
I bet it did.

26:31.157 --> 26:33.826
The beginning, when Joe Friday's
describing Los Angeles?

26:33.860 --> 26:36.128
Shots of the beautiful women
on the beach?

26:36.162 --> 26:37.864
No, the end.

26:37.897 --> 26:40.967
When the prisoner would hold up
his plaque for the mug shot.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.135
The announcer would
tell you his sentence.

26:45.972 --> 26:47.239
Charlie won't let me down.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.111
It's possible you
don't have all the facts.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.847
What exactly is it
you expect he's going to find?

26:57.784 --> 26:59.719
You know, Joe Friday never
actually said that line.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.121
But enough people

27:02.154 --> 27:04.390
repeat something, and soon
enough, it becomes the truth.

27:06.292 --> 27:07.927
It doesn't mean it's right.

27:22.341 --> 27:26.445
Okay. So, these are
the 53 most likely convicts

27:26.478 --> 27:29.215
that Garcia could have
switched bracelets with.

27:29.248 --> 27:33.285
- We'll start with Guy Baker.
- Hm-mm.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.787
What do you mean, mm?

27:34.821 --> 27:36.422
Look, he's got three kids.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.257
There's no way he's
going to cross Salazar.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.792
Okay.

27:39.826 --> 27:41.694
How about Jorge Ramos?

27:42.829 --> 27:44.964
Yeah, maybe.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.900
I mean, his father-in-law
makes Salazar look small-time.

27:47.934 --> 27:49.335
Anything happens to his
daughter or his grandkids,

27:49.368 --> 27:51.270
Salazar is dead.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.404
CHARLIE:
Orlando Casindo.

27:52.438 --> 27:55.274
No. Look. His sentence
is almost up.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.376
(chuckles)

27:57.409 --> 27:59.445
You're amazing, you know?

27:59.478 --> 28:01.280
The more stressful
the circumstance,

28:01.313 --> 28:03.282
the more clarity you have.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.384
Yeah, well, look,
my life were on the line,

28:05.417 --> 28:07.920
and someone asked you
the square root of 2007?

28:07.954 --> 28:11.323
44.7995535,
give or take a digit.

28:11.357 --> 28:13.225
See, that's clear thinking.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.298
I could have ended this
back at the prison.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.835
What, by killing Ian?

28:22.869 --> 28:24.837
I mean, it's what the textbook
says to do.

28:27.473 --> 28:30.743
You know, after seeing
the destruction at Hiroshima,

28:30.777 --> 28:34.113
Robert Oppenheimer spent
the rest of his life

28:34.146 --> 28:36.282
fighting nuclear proliferation

28:36.315 --> 28:38.417
and totally destroyed
his career,

28:38.450 --> 28:42.421
but he valued the lives of his
friends and family even more.

28:42.454 --> 28:47.359
You know, I'm thinking your
instinct was self-preservation.

28:54.967 --> 28:57.136
Galvin's got a second-degree
burn on her hand.

28:57.169 --> 28:58.805
Thompson, I warned you
not to go.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.539
What, are you on his side now?

29:00.572 --> 29:02.408
I cannot keep this jail
in lockdown forever.

29:02.441 --> 29:03.843
We can't even get a visual
on your guy.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.511
He could be dead, for all we
know.

29:05.544 --> 29:06.879
(phone rings)
You're not going in, okay?

29:06.913 --> 29:07.980
Not yet.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.816
Sinclair.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.918
Hey, David. We've narrowed down
the list of potential prisoners

29:11.951 --> 29:13.853
that Garcia switched
bracelets with to seven.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.092
Pete Lugo.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.432
Sean PiГ±eiro.

29:28.567 --> 29:29.301
Hakeem Watkins.

29:34.874 --> 29:36.475
Terell Post.

29:37.576 --> 29:38.945
Robert Ortiz.

29:41.413 --> 29:44.216
Randy Shannon.

29:48.220 --> 29:49.121
And Matthew Nunn.

29:55.594 --> 29:56.528
Empty cell.

29:56.562 --> 29:58.330
Records indicate
he's in courthouse holding.

30:01.267 --> 30:03.335
Which one's Matthew Nunn?

30:04.603 --> 30:05.504
Hey, come here.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.539
(grunts)

30:07.573 --> 30:09.108
Where's Garcia?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.542
I never heard of the man.

30:10.576 --> 30:11.543
Think harder or I swear,

30:11.577 --> 30:13.545
you'll be serving your sentence
plus his, his,

30:13.579 --> 30:15.447
and maybe his, too.

30:15.481 --> 30:16.849
I don't know. That's
the truth, I swear.

30:16.883 --> 30:18.584
Some dude said he'd
get $1,000 to my wife

30:18.617 --> 30:20.486
if I switched
bracelets with him.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.521
Damn it!

30:22.554 --> 30:24.957
(phone rings)

30:24.991 --> 30:25.992
Find him?

30:26.025 --> 30:27.193
DAVID (on phone):
We're having some problems.

30:27.226 --> 30:29.095
Charlie needs some more time.

30:29.128 --> 30:31.463
You are gonna make me hurt
this man to prove my point!

30:31.497 --> 30:34.600
DAVID:
Ian, don't. Ian? Ian?

30:40.239 --> 30:43.042
- Your boy's losing it.
- What's my best option?

30:43.075 --> 30:45.344
Explosives.

30:45.377 --> 30:46.478
We'll go through the wall.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.613
You give me 20 minutes,

30:47.646 --> 30:49.348
I'll end this thing.

30:51.483 --> 30:53.319
Do it.

31:01.127 --> 31:03.963
These are the prisoners waiting
to be taken back to the jail.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.865
And there's Garcia.

31:07.666 --> 31:10.202
As you can see, we don't know

31:10.236 --> 31:12.504
which van he went on, or whose
bracelet he's wearing now.

31:12.538 --> 31:15.107
And every prisoner that Garcia
switched bracelets with

31:15.141 --> 31:17.910
has increased his chances
of survival.

31:17.944 --> 31:19.645
The first bracelet got him

31:19.678 --> 31:21.047
out of his cell block,
and the next one

31:21.080 --> 31:22.548
got him to the courthouse.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.350
Tell me where he's going next,
I'll buy you a new Rubik's Cube.

31:24.383 --> 31:25.584
It's pursuit-evasion.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.954
I knew we'd be back to the snake
and the fish.

31:27.987 --> 31:31.090
Nope. Two children
playing hide-and-seek.

31:31.123 --> 31:34.593
The seeker counts to 50
and begins looking.

31:34.626 --> 31:37.563
But kids don't go from room
to room in an efficient manner.

31:37.596 --> 31:40.666
They run to places like
the basement or the attic first,

31:40.699 --> 31:43.002
places that offer
the best hiding spots.

31:43.035 --> 31:45.104
In a similar manner,
we look at prisoners

31:45.137 --> 31:47.306
who could have switched
bracelets with Garcia

31:47.339 --> 31:50.242
at the courthouse and rank them
based on where they're housed,

31:50.276 --> 31:54.080
or who has the safest hiding
spot from Salazar and his men.

31:54.113 --> 31:56.348
(crickets chirping)

31:56.382 --> 31:58.517
(sighs)

31:58.550 --> 32:00.686
You know, when I was, like, 12,

32:00.719 --> 32:03.255
there was this kid,
Ricky Caroll,

32:03.289 --> 32:06.993
the bully who used to terrorize
the neighborhood.

32:07.026 --> 32:08.194
So, one day,

32:08.227 --> 32:10.329
me and my friend,
we, uh, hid out

32:10.362 --> 32:11.697
and waited for him
and jumped him.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.333
And?

32:14.366 --> 32:16.035
We beat the crap out of him.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.404
Then I got home and I told
my old man what happened,

32:18.437 --> 32:21.073
and, uh, he beat
the crap out of me

32:21.107 --> 32:23.542
and said it was better
to fail with honor

32:23.575 --> 32:25.978
than to win by cheating.

32:29.581 --> 32:31.483
Think I should just quit?

32:31.517 --> 32:33.085
Trust my fate to a jury?

32:36.188 --> 32:39.491
I'd rather see you
have your day in court alive

32:39.525 --> 32:41.627
than have to stand
at your funeral, Ian.

32:44.196 --> 32:49.201
Why don't you let me help you,
the right way?

32:49.235 --> 32:50.669
(sighs)

32:50.702 --> 32:53.172
You see the way I live.

32:53.205 --> 32:55.241
I can carry my life
in a backpack.

32:55.274 --> 32:58.110
My idea of a five-star hotel is

32:58.144 --> 33:00.646
an insulated sleeping bag
and a waterproof tent.

33:00.679 --> 33:01.647
(chuckles)

33:01.680 --> 33:05.217
What the hell would I even do
with $500,000?

33:05.251 --> 33:07.486
Have you even taken a moment
to think about that?

33:15.361 --> 33:17.129
(typing)

33:17.163 --> 33:18.164
(computer trilling)

33:18.197 --> 33:19.331
What am I looking at?

33:19.365 --> 33:21.433
Garcia's transfer orders.

33:21.467 --> 33:24.203
All signed by the same person.

33:24.236 --> 33:27.005
DAVID: By the same marshal,
Frank Thompson.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.510
All right, we're good
to go, boss.

33:31.543 --> 33:33.279
Hey, hold on a sec.

33:33.312 --> 33:36.148
If that's some authority from
the DOJ, I don't give a crap.

33:36.182 --> 33:37.483
They're Garcia's transfer
orders,

33:37.516 --> 33:40.152
- denied seven times by you.
- And with good reason.

33:40.186 --> 33:42.354
THOMPSON:
You ever work a jail?

33:42.388 --> 33:44.190
Ever have three prisoners
jump you,

33:44.223 --> 33:46.825
nothing to defend yourself
with but a flashlight?

33:46.858 --> 33:49.328
No. But all of a sudden
you're an expert

33:49.361 --> 33:51.197
on how things are done
around here.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.165
DAVID: So you're saying
this is normal protocol?

33:53.199 --> 33:55.367
THOMPSON: Salazar wanted Garcia
transferred.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.069
I knew moving him
was part of his plan.

33:57.103 --> 33:57.903
Part of his plan, how?

33:57.936 --> 33:59.705
Garcia goes
to a different prison,

33:59.738 --> 34:03.309
meets new contacts and Salazar's
heroin ring continues to grow.

34:03.342 --> 34:06.412
Keep Garcia here,
at least it's contained.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.580
Now, let me do my job,

34:08.614 --> 34:09.815
get your partner home.

34:09.848 --> 34:11.683
(phone ringing)
Let's go.

34:13.819 --> 34:16.122
(phone ringing)
Sinclair.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.423
Garcia switched bracelets
with a prisoner

34:17.456 --> 34:21.460
whose number is between
223-527-885

34:21.493 --> 34:24.796
and 223-527-996.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.132
That's about 112 names,
right, Charlie?

34:26.165 --> 34:27.133
Yeah.

34:27.166 --> 34:29.168
But they're all in
the maximum security wing.

34:29.201 --> 34:32.238
If Garcia's in solitary,
then we have him cornered.

34:32.271 --> 34:34.273
Thompson, wait!

34:34.306 --> 34:35.207
(metal door slamming)

34:40.779 --> 34:42.148
(phone line ringing)

34:42.181 --> 34:43.249
(phone ringing)

34:43.282 --> 34:45.117
I'd better hear Garcia's voice

34:45.151 --> 34:45.984
on the other end
of this phone.

34:46.017 --> 34:47.853
DAVID:
Hey, we located him, all right.

34:47.886 --> 34:49.855
I need to talk my partner
right now.

34:53.392 --> 34:55.327
It's David.

34:55.361 --> 34:56.462
Still alive.

34:58.430 --> 35:01.267
We found Garcia.
He's in maximum security

35:01.300 --> 35:03.135
so it's going to take us
a few minutes to get to him.

35:03.169 --> 35:05.604
Maybe in the meantime, I could
send you guys in some food.

35:05.637 --> 35:09.208
Some Italian, you know,
maybe some Mexican.

35:09.241 --> 35:10.376
EDGERTON:
No food.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.777
Just Garcia. Five minutes.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.383
Garcia got himself transferred
to maximum security.

35:17.416 --> 35:19.451
He must've been really afraid
of Salazar.

35:19.485 --> 35:21.153
He could've figured out a way
to get to a cell block

35:21.187 --> 35:22.020
Salazar didn't control.

35:22.053 --> 35:24.190
He picked a spot
that no one can get to.

35:24.223 --> 35:26.292
A place
that's being watched 24-7.

35:26.325 --> 35:28.294
Salazar can't operate
without help inside the jail.

35:28.327 --> 35:29.228
A marshal?

35:30.262 --> 35:32.264
Garcia knew who all along,

35:32.298 --> 35:33.232
but Costello was killed

35:33.265 --> 35:34.300
before he could give me
the exact location.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.539
- You let yourself be arrested.
- I had to get in here.

35:40.572 --> 35:42.274
It was my best chance
to find Garcia.

35:42.308 --> 35:43.875
It was crazy, man.

35:43.909 --> 35:45.211
I needed Charlie's help.

35:45.244 --> 35:46.345
If I would've rabbited,

35:46.378 --> 35:47.646
nobody would've listened
to a fugitive.

35:49.448 --> 35:51.183
EDGERTON:
Five more minutes.

35:51.217 --> 35:52.584
Five more minutes and Garcia

35:52.618 --> 35:54.320
will give us Salazar's partner.

35:54.353 --> 35:56.222
We may not have that much time.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.789
The bit about the food--

35:57.823 --> 36:00.192
Mexico, it's me and David's
distress word.

36:00.226 --> 36:01.893
That means Thompson's
getting ready to breach.

36:01.927 --> 36:02.928
30 seconds.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.463
So you could ask yourself,
Granger,

36:04.496 --> 36:06.365
why is Thompson pushing
to make entry?

36:06.398 --> 36:08.634
Why wouldn't he at least listen
to what Garcia has to say?

36:08.667 --> 36:11.237
He wants to protect himself,
and now he's got to kill me.

36:12.704 --> 36:13.605
Breach has control.

36:15.774 --> 36:17.876
Ten...

36:17.909 --> 36:19.745
nine...

36:19.778 --> 36:22.848
eight... seven...

36:22.881 --> 36:24.416
Just the facts.

36:24.450 --> 36:26.318
- ...six...
- Just the facts.

36:26.352 --> 36:27.653
five...

36:27.686 --> 36:29.588
four...

36:29.621 --> 36:30.789
three...

36:32.391 --> 36:33.392
...two...

36:33.425 --> 36:34.926
one.
(beep)

36:38.430 --> 36:39.498
Hands!

36:39.531 --> 36:40.932
- Hands!
- I got him! I got him!

36:44.270 --> 36:47.773
* That would really have
helped me through *

36:49.441 --> 36:51.243
Just in case you don't shoot
any better than you think.

36:51.277 --> 36:53.279
Where the hell is Galvin?

36:54.613 --> 36:58.917
* Nothing will be left
standing from *

37:03.555 --> 37:05.291
* See it through

37:05.324 --> 37:09.361
* Nothing will be left
standing from *

37:14.466 --> 37:15.767
(gunshot)

37:22.974 --> 37:24.009
(handcuffs tightening)

37:25.577 --> 37:27.379
(panting)

37:33.419 --> 37:35.321
(crickets chirping)

37:40.459 --> 37:42.294
NIKKI: Galvin's been working
for Salazar for two years now.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.330
EDGERTON:
She convinced Thompson

37:44.363 --> 37:46.432
to reject all of Garcia's
transfer orders.

37:46.465 --> 37:48.066
And set up the phony accounts
under your name.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.436
Thompson?

37:50.469 --> 37:52.738
Only thing he's guilty of
is trusting Galvin.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.740
EDGERTON:
Well, here's where I get off.

37:54.773 --> 37:57.376
NIKKI: Hey, just until
the courts open.

37:57.409 --> 37:58.810
I'll get a judge to officially
release you.

37:58.844 --> 38:00.979
These days it could be a while.

38:02.448 --> 38:03.782
Any chance of a conjugal visit?

38:05.917 --> 38:07.018
Yeah, sure.

38:07.052 --> 38:10.956
As soon as they get cell service
in the Abajo Mountains.

38:10.989 --> 38:11.957
(chuckles)

38:11.990 --> 38:13.492
He's all yours.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.526
(door buzzing)

38:14.560 --> 38:15.794
(door opening)

38:23.402 --> 38:24.436
(fingers snapping)

38:24.470 --> 38:25.704
You see?

38:25.737 --> 38:28.474
Your gut was right.

38:28.507 --> 38:30.509
I know, one thing
I'm certain of.

38:30.542 --> 38:31.810
If I'm ever held hostage,

38:31.843 --> 38:33.512
I want you on the other side
of that trigger.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.614
Oh, well, you--
I might let them keep.

38:35.647 --> 38:37.383
*

38:37.416 --> 38:40.452
COLBY:
(sighs) Wow.

38:40.486 --> 38:41.753
Took you long enough.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.422
Oh, please, none of this
would've happened

38:43.455 --> 38:45.357
if you didn't fight
like a girl.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.458
(wry chuckle)
Come on.

38:46.492 --> 38:48.627
If anybody acted like a girl
in there, it was you.

38:48.660 --> 38:50.862
Should've heard
yourself on that phone.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.664
You're all,
"I just want to make sure

38:52.698 --> 38:53.932
my partner's all right
in there."

38:53.965 --> 38:55.501
Downright embarrassing.

38:55.534 --> 38:56.902
If I let you die,

38:56.935 --> 38:57.903
you know the kind of paperwork

38:57.936 --> 38:59.438
I'm going to have to fill out?

38:59.471 --> 39:01.907
All right, I can just kiss
my promotion good-bye.

39:03.041 --> 39:04.510
(groans)

39:04.543 --> 39:07.012
Wow. This feels good.

39:08.714 --> 39:11.617
Guess you won't mind
driving, then, right?

39:18.590 --> 39:20.859
Hey.
(chuckles)

39:20.892 --> 39:22.861
Why am I always going to bed
when everyone else is waking up?

39:22.894 --> 39:24.530
Well, at least this time
you're not alone.

39:24.563 --> 39:25.964
- I'm right here with you.
- Thanks.

39:25.997 --> 39:27.399
It's like when we were kids,

39:27.433 --> 39:28.534
we used to stay up all night

39:28.567 --> 39:29.801
and sneak downstairs
and watch TV.

39:29.835 --> 39:30.802
Oh, yeah,

39:30.836 --> 39:32.438
we'd lie to Mom, right?
And then what'd she say?

39:32.471 --> 39:34.873
Oh, "Only the truth
will set you free."

39:34.906 --> 39:37.743
(clicks tongue)
Hey.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.545
Ian bet his life on you, kid.

39:40.746 --> 39:43.482
You could say the same thing
about you.

39:43.515 --> 39:47.085
You sure that's why
I didn't pull the trigger?

39:47.118 --> 39:48.420
Oh.

39:48.454 --> 39:50.155
I'd bet my life on it.
