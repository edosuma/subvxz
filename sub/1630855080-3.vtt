WEBVTT

00:06.756 --> 00:09.801
(quiet street noise)

00:09.801 --> 00:11.636
(air brakes hiss)

00:11.636 --> 00:13.763
(truck rumbling)

00:20.979 --> 00:23.898
(repeated truck horn blasting)

00:23.898 --> 00:27.110
(yelling, cheering)

00:38.747 --> 00:40.915
- (air brakes hiss)
- (cheering continues)

00:40.915 --> 00:44.127
(sand rushing)

00:52.552 --> 00:55.680
(cheering continues)

01:00.101 --> 01:01.644
El Toro.

01:01.644 --> 01:05.273
(muffled chatter)

01:07.317 --> 01:10.320
It's an honor to finally
meet you, Toro.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.739
Toro:
Glad to help with
your little problem.

01:12.739 --> 01:15.074
It was nice
when Hank checked in.

01:15.074 --> 01:17.577
Uh, you have to be
afraid of nothing.

01:17.577 --> 01:19.537
Uh, the Berkman hit
will happen today,

01:19.537 --> 01:21.831
and I got two of
my best guys on it.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.751
Uh, Nestor
and, uh, Chuy Flores.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.087
Wait a minute. You mean
the guys from the podcast?

01:29.380 --> 01:31.424
(sighs) Yes.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.843
But it won't interfere
with their schedule.

01:33.843 --> 01:36.179
They, they record on Thursdays.

01:37.096 --> 01:38.306
That's good.

01:38.306 --> 01:41.643
So, the guys who are going
to kill Barry have a podcast?

01:41.643 --> 01:43.853
Yeah, It's called
"Los Amigos Gadget."

01:43.853 --> 01:46.022
Each week,
they rate and review
a different gadget,

01:46.022 --> 01:48.483
but none of the gadgets work.
Like, once,

01:48.483 --> 01:51.069
they did a jacket
that cooks s'mores
in its pocket.

01:51.069 --> 01:53.863
- (Cristobal laughs)
- It's really stupid. (laughs)

01:53.863 --> 01:55.698
- I bought one of those.
- (laughter stops)

01:55.698 --> 01:57.200
It works fine.

01:59.202 --> 02:00.787
But won't they be recognized?

02:04.374 --> 02:06.918
Podcast is voice.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.628
Y-You're thinking
of the TikToks.

02:08.628 --> 02:10.588
Nobody knows what
they look like.

02:10.588 --> 02:11.965
To be honest,

02:11.965 --> 02:14.801
it's my one issue with
"Los Amigos Gadgets."

02:14.801 --> 02:17.720
It's a show about gadgets,
but you have to listen

02:17.720 --> 02:20.723
and imagine what
the gadgets look like.

02:21.641 --> 02:24.310
There is a link
to YouTube.

02:25.144 --> 02:28.982
If you wanna
see the gadgets themselves,
you, you click on it.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.860
Right, but I'm listening
while I'm driving.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.695
So, am I supposed to,

02:33.695 --> 02:35.947
you know, pull over...

02:35.947 --> 02:39.409
just to...
click on that link?

02:40.076 --> 02:41.411
(sighs)

02:43.538 --> 02:44.747
Yeah.

02:44.747 --> 02:46.916
I'll do that.
I'll start doing that.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.460
The FBI is cutting
a deal with Barry.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.504
He's informing on
some big crime figures.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.631
Apparently,
he's very valuable to them.

02:53.631 --> 02:55.842
Sir, if he goes free,

02:55.842 --> 02:57.468
he is going to come
and kill me.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.095
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves, okay?

02:59.095 --> 03:02.098
I'm sure you've got some,
some big protocols i-in place

03:02.098 --> 03:03.600
to protect your
witnesses, right?

03:03.600 --> 03:05.602
We have some,
but if a defendant
is willing

03:05.602 --> 03:07.061
and determined,
it can be hard.

03:07.061 --> 03:09.355
But that's usually ex-military,
so I'm not too worried.

03:09.355 --> 03:11.566
Barry is ex-military.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.942
Oh.

03:14.110 --> 03:15.403
(sighs)

03:15.403 --> 03:17.405
Do you own a gun,
Mr. Cousineau?

03:17.405 --> 03:20.366
H-He does own a prop gun,
which he was given by Rip Torn.

03:20.366 --> 03:23.411
If Rip Torn gave it to you,
it probably fires real bullets.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.163
- (Tom groans)
- That's good.

03:25.496 --> 03:28.499
You know what?
I'm just gonna go into hiding.

03:28.499 --> 03:29.918
They always find you.

03:29.918 --> 03:32.795
I've had many cases like this,
but I can't talk about them.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.797
- Because they're classified?
- James Buckner: No.

03:34.797 --> 03:36.090
They're really disturbing

03:36.090 --> 03:38.134
and I just don't like
thinking about them.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.345
We're in a good position here.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.930
Your story
and the facts line up.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.475
There's nothing they
have to cloud the case
and set him free.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.852
We've controlled
the information.

03:47.852 --> 03:51.230
So, just continue
to stick to the facts.

03:51.230 --> 03:53.566
And when you're
outside this office,

03:53.566 --> 03:55.610
keep your mouth shut.

03:56.819 --> 03:58.404
(Tom sighs)

04:06.371 --> 04:08.331
Tom, I have to
ask you a question.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.833
It's completely hypothetical.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.085
Tom:
What is it?

04:12.085 --> 04:14.879
Alright, do you think
it would be an issue

04:14.879 --> 04:18.174
if I invited a reporter
to my theater...

04:25.098 --> 04:26.474
(tires squeal)

04:28.059 --> 04:30.561
- (car crashes)
- (car alarm blaring)

04:30.561 --> 04:33.731
You performed a one-man show
for fucking Lon O'Neil?!

04:33.731 --> 04:36.985
- What is wrong with you?
- What the fuck
is wrong with you?

04:36.985 --> 04:40.113
I don't know!
What do we do?

04:40.113 --> 04:42.865
We have to stop that article
from coming out!

04:42.865 --> 04:44.993
(gate buzzes)

04:44.993 --> 04:47.453
Let me get this straight.

04:48.579 --> 04:52.500
So, NoHo Hank and Cristobal...

04:52.500 --> 04:53.960
are an item?

04:53.960 --> 04:58.548
Yeah. Yeah, they started working
with each other on a job

04:58.548 --> 05:00.383
and then, that just
grew into somethin'.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.469
- You know, they're actually
really in love.
- That must be nice.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.264
And you say they're building
a crime utopia?

05:06.264 --> 05:09.183
I mean, that's what they were
doing when I worked with them.

05:09.183 --> 05:10.852
I trained some of their guys.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.065
This is big, Barry.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.817
And you held up
your end of the bargain.

05:18.693 --> 05:20.278
So...

05:20.778 --> 05:22.864
We looked into this Sally Reed.

05:23.406 --> 05:27.493
Now, she'll have to completely
give up her old life,

05:27.493 --> 05:29.871
her family, her friends.

05:29.871 --> 05:32.874
No contact with anyone
from her past.

05:32.874 --> 05:34.917
How does she feel about this?

05:36.502 --> 05:38.546
I-I haven't asked her
about it yet.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.256
But I think she'll be into it.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.425
Actually, I know
she'll be into it.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.177
You know, she said I, um...

05:45.344 --> 05:46.971
said I make her feel safe.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.181
(phone buzzes)

05:49.307 --> 05:51.142
Berkman, you got a visitor.

05:53.227 --> 05:54.687
Who are you?

05:54.687 --> 05:57.106
Lon O'Neil:
I'm writing a piece about
Detective Janice Moss

05:57.106 --> 05:59.400
and the events
surrounding her death.

06:01.736 --> 06:04.405
I don't...
C-Can I talk about that?

06:04.405 --> 06:05.990
Absolutely.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.409
I mean, it's only fair
you get a chance

06:08.409 --> 06:10.036
to respond to the accusations

06:10.036 --> 06:12.705
that Gene Cousineau's
been making against you.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.499
What's he saying?

06:14.749 --> 06:17.627
(inhales) He's saying
that you killed her,

06:17.627 --> 06:19.879
you kidnapped him.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.173
And that you
threatened his family.

06:23.966 --> 06:24.926
He told you that?

06:24.926 --> 06:26.803
It took over three hours,

06:26.803 --> 06:29.388
but, yes, he told me that.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.475
Why don't you tell me

06:32.475 --> 06:35.103
what happened the night
you were arrested, okay?

06:35.728 --> 06:38.397
Why did you go into
Jim Moss's house?

06:39.690 --> 06:41.859
Who do you write for again?

06:42.193 --> 06:43.820
O'Neil:
"Vanity Fair."

06:44.612 --> 06:47.115
Wait, do you guys have
Julia Roberts on your cover?

06:47.573 --> 06:50.076
Uh, yeah, I-I-I'm sure
at some point,

06:50.076 --> 06:52.745
- we had Julia Roberts--
- And he said
I-I threatened his family?

06:52.745 --> 06:54.163
Did you?

07:00.294 --> 07:02.964
- Well, I apologized
for all that.
- O'Neil: Mm-hmm...

07:02.964 --> 07:04.841
Barry:
So...

07:06.759 --> 07:09.679
Listen, you know,
I got a, a good...

07:09.679 --> 07:11.514
- case here.
- O'Neil: Mm-hmm.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.559
And I'm cooperating
and everything, so I don't--

07:18.020 --> 07:20.690
If he keeps running
his mouth and-and...

07:20.690 --> 07:23.568
telling my story to people, then...

07:23.568 --> 07:25.653
(chewing) Mm-hmm. Okay.

07:25.653 --> 07:27.947
If he's saying that stuff,

07:27.947 --> 07:30.324
and he's running his mouth,
it's gonna fuck shit up.

07:30.324 --> 07:33.619
- And if you,
and if you publish it--
- Yep. I-I'm gonna publish it.

07:35.413 --> 07:38.833
It's really just your chance
to say your piece.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.877
I'm only trying
to be fair here.

07:42.211 --> 07:44.547
You know what'd be fair?
You know what'd be
fuckin' fair?!

07:44.547 --> 07:46.883
Is if Gene Cousineau
stops telling my life story!

07:46.883 --> 07:49.051
That's what'd be fuckin' fair!

07:49.051 --> 07:52.346
Tell Gene Cousineau
to shut his fuckin' mouth!

07:57.894 --> 07:58.811
(hangs up)

07:58.811 --> 08:01.189
(quiet chatter)

08:01.189 --> 08:02.899
Sally:
Hello! Hi.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.318
- (chatter stops)
- I'm Sally Reed,

08:05.318 --> 08:08.529
uh, and today, I'm gonna teach
you how to be actors.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.115
Um...

08:11.365 --> 08:14.368
I learned my craft from
Mr. Gene M. Cousineau,

08:14.368 --> 08:16.204
and today,

08:16.204 --> 08:19.874
you will be learning
his techniques through me.

08:20.541 --> 08:21.417
(sighs)

08:21.417 --> 08:23.252
Um, they've been
very helpful for me,

08:23.252 --> 08:26.964
as well as for many other
working actors. Um...

08:28.716 --> 08:30.343
Sorry. Um...

08:31.177 --> 08:32.345
Look, how many of you are here

08:32.345 --> 08:34.180
'cause I'm
the Entitled Cunt Girl?

08:37.808 --> 08:39.435
- Ah.
- I know about you,

08:39.435 --> 08:41.354
but that's not why
I wanted to take the classes.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.023
Same. I mean, I actually
thought that the video

08:44.023 --> 08:46.692
- was super unfair and overblown.
- Student: Yeah.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.028
I mean, everyone's allowed
to get angry, right? (laughs)

08:49.028 --> 08:51.280
- Thank you!
- Pretty much like every fight

08:51.280 --> 08:54.283
- that I get into with my sister.
- (group laughing, agreeing)

08:54.283 --> 08:57.078
That was an ugly moment.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.789
I can... I can see that now.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.166
But it was genuine.
And ultimately,

09:02.166 --> 09:05.419
it's where I want you to go
in this class.

09:05.419 --> 09:09.090
As actors, we have to
be vulnerable. I mean,

09:09.090 --> 09:13.219
we have to be the ugliest
versions of ourselves.

09:13.219 --> 09:14.553
We all have it in us.

09:14.887 --> 09:18.349
And to trigger it voluntarily
takes strength.

09:18.349 --> 09:22.061
Okay. Uh, normally, we do
some warm-up exercises

09:22.061 --> 09:24.438
and then
I'm supposed to drone on
about theory or whatever,

09:24.438 --> 09:26.107
but I always hated
that part of class.

09:26.107 --> 09:28.192
So if it's okay with you,
I think we should just...

09:28.192 --> 09:30.111
dive right in! Okay.

09:30.111 --> 09:32.071
Did everybody bring a scene?

09:33.531 --> 09:34.865
O'Neil:
Jim Moss? Lon O'Neil.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.701
I'm so sorry to
bother you at home.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.953
I told you.
Leave me alone.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.246
I spoke to Barry Berkman.

09:40.246 --> 09:41.455
He seems to think

09:41.455 --> 09:43.249
that Gene Cousineau
is trying to railroad him,

09:43.249 --> 09:45.167
and I wanted
your thoughts on that and

09:45.167 --> 09:46.877
- on your daughter's case.
- Why would he think

09:46.877 --> 09:49.338
that Gene's trying
to railroad him?

09:49.338 --> 09:51.799
Well, I told him what
Mr. Cousineau said to me,

09:51.799 --> 09:54.218
and he didn't seem
very happy about it.

09:56.053 --> 09:57.722
You spoke to Cousineau?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.390
Oh, yes, I did.

10:01.809 --> 10:02.935
(slight laugh)

10:04.270 --> 10:06.939
Let's go have a chat
in my garage.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.441
(doors shut)

10:08.441 --> 10:10.985
Yo, big man.
Yo, Big Bird!

10:10.985 --> 10:13.154
(laughing)

10:13.154 --> 10:15.781
Yo, Big Bird!
Where's your dude at?

10:15.781 --> 10:18.784
Aw... What's the matter?
Come on, Raven.

10:18.784 --> 10:22.455
- Aw, he sad.
- Mr. Rave-- You got
a new code name? Mr. Lonely?

10:22.705 --> 10:25.333
- Damian: Hey, Goose!
- (both laugh)

10:25.333 --> 10:27.084
Jason:
Where's your associate?

10:27.084 --> 10:28.753
Dude with the busted face.
Y'all break up?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.671
Damian:
I heard he sold you out. Aw...

10:30.671 --> 10:33.007
- Jason: Aw...
- Damian: Lookin' like
Boo-Boo the Fool now.

10:33.007 --> 10:35.217
- (phone buzzes)
- This is NoHo Hank.

10:35.217 --> 10:37.011
Fuches (on phone):
<i>Hank, have you
ever been called</i>

10:37.011 --> 10:38.429
<i>Boo-Boo the Fool before?</i>

10:38.429 --> 10:40.514
Uh, I don't think so.

10:40.806 --> 10:42.558
Well, I have,

10:42.558 --> 10:44.143
and it's very hurtful.

10:44.143 --> 10:46.354
<i>I've also been
called Big Bird,</i>

10:46.354 --> 10:48.773
<i>Fish Tits,
and Baby Shoes.</i>

10:48.773 --> 10:51.317
<i>All because
Barry fucked me over.</i>

10:51.317 --> 10:53.903
<i>My whole life, I put myself
on the line for that guy,</i>

10:53.903 --> 10:56.030
<i>and all I ever got
in return is shit.</i>

10:56.030 --> 10:57.615
It's being taken care of.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.701
- What does that mean?
- NoHo Hank (on phone):
<i>By the end of the day,</i>

11:00.701 --> 11:03.037
<i>Barry won't be
a problem anymore.</i>

11:03.037 --> 11:04.747
He won't?

11:04.747 --> 11:06.290
NoHo Hank:
<i>And look,</i>

11:06.290 --> 11:08.209
<i>we have
to stop communicating.</i>

11:08.209 --> 11:09.919
<i>Here's what I need you to do.</i>

11:11.212 --> 11:12.963
<i>Keep your mouth shut.</i>

11:12.963 --> 11:14.548
- Okay.
- NoHo Hank: <i>Play stupid,</i>

11:14.548 --> 11:17.718
<i>- and you'll be paid
for it on the other end.</i>
- Okay.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.762
(footsteps approach)

11:23.099 --> 11:25.434
Hey, guys!
Come on, take five.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.144
- Go on.
- (crew chattering)

11:27.144 --> 11:28.771
Go hydrate.

11:29.939 --> 11:32.608
Hey, guys, take five!
Hey, buddy.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.318
- (snapping)
- Take a break.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.530
(ominous music playing)

11:44.328 --> 11:45.413
Batir?

11:45.413 --> 11:47.915
This new
organization of yours

11:47.915 --> 11:50.709
is a direct affront
to your homeland.

11:51.210 --> 11:54.630
I come to you...
as a friend...

11:55.256 --> 11:56.507
to tell you

11:56.507 --> 11:59.427
that the elders
have a new contingent

11:59.427 --> 12:01.345
to run LA.

12:01.637 --> 12:04.473
You either get rid
of those guys and join us,

12:04.473 --> 12:08.436
or we will wipe... you... out.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.397
Well...

12:11.397 --> 12:13.816
you can tell the elders...

12:15.025 --> 12:16.944
that that would be a mistake.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.779
(scoffs)

12:18.779 --> 12:21.824
(laughing)

12:21.824 --> 12:23.534
Batir:
Think about it, Hank.

12:26.203 --> 12:29.331
(footsteps recede)

12:30.249 --> 12:31.834
(sighs)

12:33.711 --> 12:35.337
Fuckin' piece of shit.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.382
I did so fuckin' much for you.

12:38.382 --> 12:41.010
I did so fuckin' much for you,
and this is what you do?

12:41.010 --> 12:43.304
(echoing)
This is what you fuckin' do!

12:44.472 --> 12:46.557
Fuckin' piece of shit!

12:48.851 --> 12:50.019
I fuckin' help you out.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.688
I fuckin' save your fuckin' ass!

12:53.731 --> 12:55.858
Fuck you. Fuck you!

12:57.318 --> 12:58.986
Motherfucker.

12:58.986 --> 13:01.780
I do so fuckin' much
for people, and--

13:09.038 --> 13:10.122
(muttering)

13:16.795 --> 13:19.924
(heavy breathing)

13:26.305 --> 13:29.517
- (birds chirping outside)
- (clock ticking)

13:31.227 --> 13:33.437
- (knocking)
- I don't see anybody.

13:39.568 --> 13:42.488
- Tom: Are you sure that
this is Lon's house?
- Yes, I'm positive this is--

13:42.488 --> 13:43.864
- What are you doing?!
- (Tom grunts)

13:43.864 --> 13:46.200
- (glass breaking)
- Gene: You're crazy!

13:46.200 --> 13:48.369
What did you just do? Tom!

13:48.369 --> 13:50.538
- Tom: It's the only way, Gene.
- Gene: We cannot break in there.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.332
- (glass breaking, crunching)
- (indistinct arguing)

13:53.332 --> 13:56.377
- Gene: Get down.
We cannot be doing this.
- (Tom grunting)

13:56.377 --> 13:58.420
- Tom: Be careful,
there's a lot of glass.
- (Gene sighs)

13:58.420 --> 14:01.423
- (glass crunching)
- Tom: Alright, we've got
very little time.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.176
- Come on, Gene.
Come on. Come on in.
- (Gene grunting, falling)

14:04.176 --> 14:05.970
- Gene: Ow...
- Tom: Get up off
the floor, Gene.

14:05.970 --> 14:07.846
- Gene: Oh, I just laid in glass.
- Tom: Come on. Get up.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.807
- Gene: Tom. Tom, quick.
- Tom: Come on, come on.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.225
- Gene: Come back.
- Tom: You're fine, Gene.

14:11.225 --> 14:12.643
- Gene: Tom, what are you doing?
- (dog barking)

14:12.643 --> 14:15.479
- Tom: They got a dog. Alright.
- Gene: I'm fine. I'm fine...

14:15.479 --> 14:17.064
- (barking continues)
- (Tom groans)

14:17.064 --> 14:20.401
- (smashing, crashing)
- (Tom yelling)

14:20.401 --> 14:23.487
Hurry up!
That was illegal!

14:23.487 --> 14:25.072
Tom:
Ah, shit.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.241
- That's the kitchen in there.
- (barking)

14:27.241 --> 14:29.535
- (smashes door, cat yowls)
- Bingo! Found it.

14:29.535 --> 14:32.705
- Gene: What are you doing?!
- Tom: Alright, come on.
We gotta smash it.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.790
- No, no. Everything's
stored in the monitor.
- Gene: No, I don't--

14:34.790 --> 14:37.543
Tom:
I'm telling you, everything
is stored in the monitor.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.753
Gene:
No, I think you gotta
get the hard drive.

14:39.753 --> 14:41.297
Tom:
This is one of those
new computers.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.257
You just bust the monitor,
and it loses everything.
Come on.

14:43.257 --> 14:45.926
- Gene: Tom, that's the monitor!
Get the hard drive!
- Tom: Gene, don't argue with me.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.846
- Gene Cousineau?
- Gene: Lon's wife's
in the house!

14:48.846 --> 14:50.306
(footsteps approach)

14:50.306 --> 14:52.057
What's going on?

14:52.057 --> 14:53.976
Hi, I'm Gene Cousineau.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.437
Wh-Why are you in my house?

14:56.437 --> 14:58.314
- Is there someone else here?
- Do you know,

14:58.314 --> 15:00.482
I was so worried about Lon

15:00.482 --> 15:03.777
that I came to check to see
if the house was broken into.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.696
Is this about
the Barry Berkman article?

15:05.696 --> 15:08.866
I wish you would call it
the Gene Cousineau article,
but yes.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.785
(sighs) God,
I'm actually worried.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.912
- (Tom grunts)
- I can't get a hold of him.

15:13.912 --> 15:16.332
Last time we spoke
was this morning.

15:16.332 --> 15:19.335
He was doing a interview
on your article.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.212
- Did he tell you
where he was going?
- No...

15:22.212 --> 15:24.632
Oh, well, he said he needed

15:24.632 --> 15:27.217
to check on a victim's father.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.219
Do you know who that is?

15:29.219 --> 15:31.430
Victim's father?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.642
(lisping)
You need your juice, Shelby.
Drink your juice.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.019
The first rule of
Fight Club is...

15:37.019 --> 15:38.812
y-you don't talk
about Fight Club.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.523
Coach, it's me. Rudy.
Put me in.

15:41.523 --> 15:45.152
I'm big.
It's the pictures
that got small.

15:46.904 --> 15:49.573
- (sighs)
- Okay, what's going on?

15:49.573 --> 15:51.742
Uh, I picked
<i>Sunset Boulevard</i> ?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.869
- Okay.
- Student: Well, I,
I thought maybe

15:53.869 --> 15:55.954
we would do something
from a play or something,

15:55.954 --> 15:59.333
a-and then I saw that everybody
brought in movie scenes, so...

16:00.084 --> 16:03.337
I just googled famous
movie quotes and... (laughs)

16:03.337 --> 16:05.881
Well, did you bring
in something from a play?

16:05.881 --> 16:09.259
Uh... God, I had a thing.
Uh, what was it from?

16:10.511 --> 16:11.845
(sighs)

16:12.930 --> 16:15.224
I-- No. (laughs) I guess...

16:15.224 --> 16:18.977
- So, y-you didn't
bring in anything?
- Student: No.

16:18.977 --> 16:21.063
I'm lame. (chuckles)

16:21.063 --> 16:23.148
- I'll just excuse myself.
- You're charming.

16:23.774 --> 16:28.028
- (chuckles) Okay.
- Is that why you wanna
be an actress?

16:28.028 --> 16:29.613
Uh, I-I don't know.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.700
Do people say to you,
"Oh, you're so pretty?

16:32.700 --> 16:36.704
You're so charming.
You should be an actress."

16:36.704 --> 16:39.081
- Do they say that to you?
- (student scoffs)

16:39.081 --> 16:41.291
- Student: Yeah.
- Yeah?

16:42.501 --> 16:45.963
And do you feel
like you have a need

16:45.963 --> 16:49.800
to express something?

16:52.261 --> 16:53.637
Like?

16:54.555 --> 16:56.807
Like, I don't know,

16:56.807 --> 16:58.809
complexity? Hope?

16:59.059 --> 17:03.355
Desire?
The human condition?

17:03.355 --> 17:05.482
Or do you just
wanna be charming?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.279
- (scoffs)
- Oh.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.656
So you're not an artist.

17:12.656 --> 17:14.658
You're just
a perfect pair of tits.

17:14.658 --> 17:15.659
No!

17:15.659 --> 17:19.538
Then why the fuck
are you here?

17:21.331 --> 17:23.333
- I can't say.
- Why not?

17:23.333 --> 17:25.502
- Student: I don't want to.
- What? (laughs)

17:25.502 --> 17:27.963
You're afraid we're all gonna be
bowled over by your intellect?

17:27.963 --> 17:29.298
No.

17:31.216 --> 17:32.926
Did you book something?

17:35.053 --> 17:36.930
- (nervous sigh)
- Oh.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.850
They wanted a hot girl,
and you fit the bill.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.978
- Only trouble is you can't act,
so you come to me?
- Student: No.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.272
And because you've coasted
your whole damn life

17:45.272 --> 17:47.775
on your God-given tits and ass
and your inherent charm,

17:47.775 --> 17:50.944
you think you can come
in here to my class,

17:50.944 --> 17:53.530
unprepared, waste my time,

17:53.530 --> 17:55.783
- and I'm gonna let you
off the hook?
- Student: No.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.117
Well, that's what you did,

17:57.117 --> 17:59.369
- isn't it?
- You're being mean.

17:59.369 --> 18:00.996
Oh...

18:00.996 --> 18:02.456
Oh, I'm being mean?

18:02.456 --> 18:05.125
Oh, what? So now,
I'm dealing with a child!

18:05.125 --> 18:08.128
What, nobody's ever been
mean to you before? Why?

18:08.128 --> 18:10.672
'Cause your personality?
Your big brain?

18:10.672 --> 18:12.049
Your taste in old movies?
Or maybe,

18:12.049 --> 18:14.510
it's just because
they all wanted to fuck you!

18:14.510 --> 18:16.261
Stop it!

18:16.261 --> 18:19.473
Don't think.
Now, say the line.

18:19.473 --> 18:21.350
I'm big!

18:21.350 --> 18:23.644
It's the pictures
that got small!

18:25.354 --> 18:28.690
- (gasping)
- Good. You okay?

18:28.690 --> 18:30.859
That was beautiful.

18:30.859 --> 18:34.363
I'm so sorry I had to go there.
What you just witnessed--

18:34.363 --> 18:36.323
What was your name again?

18:36.323 --> 18:38.992
- Kristen?
- What you just
witnessed Kristen do

18:38.992 --> 18:41.954
is the backbone of this class.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.998
It's about locating
the parts of ourselves

18:44.998 --> 18:47.960
that we don't like,
and making them our, our...

18:47.960 --> 18:49.962
our paints, our--

18:49.962 --> 18:52.256
That was abusive.

18:54.091 --> 18:56.760
Well, it's part of the work.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.512
It's Cousineau's method.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.555
Just 'cause it was done to you,

18:59.555 --> 19:01.682
does not mean
you need to do it to us.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.436
Okay, uh,
let's take a tight five.

19:06.895 --> 19:09.481
And, um, when we come back,

19:10.607 --> 19:13.402
we'll do some mirror exercises.

19:13.402 --> 19:16.697
- (indistinct chatter)
- (door shuts)

19:28.125 --> 19:29.459
(tapping fingers)

19:29.459 --> 19:31.253
Operator (on phone):
<i>This call may be recorded.</i>

19:31.253 --> 19:33.255
<i>You have received
a collect call from...</i>

19:33.255 --> 19:34.631
- Barry.
- Operator: <i>...an inmate</i>

19:34.631 --> 19:36.258
<i>at California
State Penitentiary.</i>

19:36.258 --> 19:38.427
<i>Do you accept
the charges?</i>

19:41.179 --> 19:43.432
- NoHo Hank: Yes.
- (call connects)

19:43.432 --> 19:45.017
Barry (on phone):
<i>Hi, Hank.</i>

19:45.017 --> 19:46.476
(chair creaks)

19:49.021 --> 19:50.731
Hey, Barry.

19:50.731 --> 19:52.441
Barry:
<i>You good?</i>

19:54.109 --> 19:57.905
- Hey, look, um,
we got a situation.
- (drumming fingers)

19:58.488 --> 19:59.573
Yeah...

19:59.573 --> 20:01.241
Mr. Cousineau,
Gene Cousineau.

20:01.241 --> 20:03.535
He's my acting teacher.
He's, uh...

20:04.953 --> 20:07.247
He's talking to the press.

20:07.247 --> 20:10.250
- NoHo Hank: <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- And, um...

20:12.044 --> 20:13.128
(clicks tongue)

20:14.379 --> 20:16.840
Uh, I'm trying to be
discreet here.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.801
If-If he was a dog,
he-he'd need to go...

20:19.801 --> 20:20.969
to a new home.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.014
Uh-huh.

20:28.518 --> 20:31.688
I need-- I need a dog catcher.
(laughs)

20:31.688 --> 20:33.732
I-I don't know if I need
to spell this out for you

20:33.732 --> 20:37.736
any more than
I already am, Hank. (laughs)

20:38.570 --> 20:40.822
But I need your help.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.282
<i>Like, now.</i>

20:43.033 --> 20:45.869
Are you looking out
for me, Barry?

20:48.372 --> 20:49.790
Yeah. No, I mean, no.

20:49.790 --> 20:53.168
He's got information
on you and Cristobal.
That's what I'm...

20:53.168 --> 20:54.378
That's what I'm sayin'.

20:54.378 --> 20:56.546
Is that he, he's got a lot
of information on you.

20:59.675 --> 21:01.677
(sighs)

21:01.677 --> 21:04.262
Why are you lying to me,
Barry?

21:05.973 --> 21:08.183
Wh-Why would you say
I'm lying? I don't--

21:09.101 --> 21:10.143
I'm not lying.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.437
You're lying to me right now.

21:15.148 --> 21:17.150
Hank, what are
you talkin' about?

21:17.150 --> 21:18.944
Barry, I have been nothing

21:18.944 --> 21:22.322
but loving and good friend
to you, and...

21:22.322 --> 21:24.700
like all you do is you take.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.618
And you take and you take.

21:27.494 --> 21:28.578
Barry:
<i>Hank.</i>

21:28.870 --> 21:30.664

everything up.

23:39.584 --> 23:40.961
Let's go and talk to Lon.
