Line of sight on the West gate.
Line of sight on the hanger.

00:51.677 --> 00:52.678
Affirmative, all clear.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.222
-Anybody sweep the plane?
-Last night.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.224
Sweep it again just to be safe.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.944
-Mr. Krauss, stay in the car, sir.
-Get back in the car, sir.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.946
We cannot protect you
if you're not in the car.

[huge explosion]

01:38.765 --> 01:40.517
[woman] Tony, look that's Crete.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.021
That's in Greece. That should be us.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.439
Yeah.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.026
Look at that sand.

01:50.569 --> 01:51.737
I'll take you to Coney Island.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.322
-All the sand you can eat.
-Shut up.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.699
You think you're funny?
You're not funny. Byron, kill him.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.492
-Byron.
-Where are your little scissors?

01:57.576 --> 01:58.702
This is a puncher.

01:59.036 --> 02:00.912
This is better than cutting. See?

02:01.163 --> 02:04.583
This keeps the end intact
and you get a nice solid draw.

02:05.292 --> 02:06.627
"With love, TJ."

02:07.085 --> 02:07.919
That's so sweet.

02:08.003 --> 02:09.004
It was a gift.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.964
Back when the kid wanted me to be happy.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.842
My God, look at that.

02:14.051 --> 02:15.427
-I want to go.
-Listen.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.346
I'm blocking that channel.

02:18.180 --> 02:19.723
This is a dangerous channel.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.266
Go ahead, honey...

02:21.767 --> 02:22.726
you can block it.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.436
Block it all you want.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.521
But you can't block this.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.232
"Happy birthday, Baby.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.777
This coupon is good for one vacation,

02:31.902 --> 02:33.612

02:34.112 --> 02:35.489
Good, you didn't lose it.

02:35.572 --> 02:36.740
I know what you were thinking.

02:36.865 --> 02:38.867
"It's her birthday,
I'll make her a little coupon.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.911
It's not cost me a thing.
She'll forget about it."

02:40.994 --> 02:42.204
No, no, no, no...

02:42.329 --> 02:44.539
Listen, I'm good for it.
My word is my bond.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.417
-[TJ] Do you smell smoke?
-No. Easy, easy...

02:47.501 --> 02:49.044
Holster that weapon, Son.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.921
In the house, Dad?
We talked about this.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.172
I'm sorry.

02:52.255 --> 02:53.799
I know. Okay, I'm put ing it out.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.425
I'm putting it out. Look.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.053
Nobody's smoking, except Debbie.

02:58.220 --> 03:01.181
TJ, I want you to arrest your father
for breach of contract.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.393
-You had it notarized?
-I insisted.

03:04.601 --> 03:05.852
Debbie Paddock, I am impressed.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.438
You've been dating for four months,
you've already got his number.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.065
I'm a veteran. Twice divorced.

03:10.148 --> 03:12.567
-I know when a man is full of crap.
-Wait a minute.

03:12.651 --> 03:15.779
Sweetheart, we can't drop everything
and take off. What about you store?

03:15.862 --> 03:18.532
It's a salon. That's why I have a partner.

03:18.615 --> 03:20.575
-Janice can handle it.
-[Tony Sr. sighs]

03:20.826 --> 03:23.328
So where are we going,
Mister "My word is my bond?"

03:40.011 --> 03:41.430
The Circle Line?

03:41.513 --> 03:44.307
The Best of Both Worlds.
You get to stay in New York,

03:44.558 --> 03:45.809
but you're on a ship.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.729
-That's not a real cruise.
-You don't want a real cruise.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.939
Wendel Kirk took his wife
on one last year.

03:51.189 --> 03:53.191
It didn't get stuck anywhere.
Nobody got sick.

03:53.275 --> 03:55.861
-So?
-So, he had nobody to sue.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.362
He was out four grand.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.030
[doorbell rings]

03:59.322 --> 04:02.075
You know, I'm glad I realized it now,
before it's too late.

04:02.159 --> 04:03.702
-You'll say anything, Tony.
-Come on.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.662
They're just words.
You don't mean any of it.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.124
Lieutenant Caruso. Is your father home?

04:19.384 --> 04:22.262
I thought you had a star witness.
What happened to Enrico Krauss?

04:23.305 --> 04:24.931
We had an arrangement with Mr. Krauss,

04:25.015 --> 04:26.808
but he decided to pull out
at the last minute.

04:27.184 --> 04:30.061
I guess he's smarter than he looks.
He'd almost have to be.

04:30.479 --> 04:32.272
-[TJ sighs]
-Here's our situation.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.149
We have Remy DeRosa in custody.

04:34.232 --> 04:37.861
He's the biggest narcotics dealer
in the state. Trial starts in 10 days,

04:37.944 --> 04:40.614
And you just lost your witness,
so you need my father to testify.

04:40.989 --> 04:44.242
Yes, sir. Without Mr. Krauss, your father
is the only chance we have.

04:46.244 --> 04:49.414
Tony, when you were Upstate,
he was your cellmate for three years.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.667
-You must have talked to him.
-Your testimony could put him away.

04:52.751 --> 04:55.337
Listen guys, I've got to stop you.
I'm not your guy.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.007
I did seven years upstate...
without rolling over on anybody.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.468
I'm not a rat. That's my line in the sand.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.469
Or...

05:02.677 --> 05:06.389
Just thinking out loud here. Don't laugh.
...you could do the right thing.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.226
Son, where I come from,
this is the right thing.

05:09.351 --> 05:10.644
I'm sorry. Guys...

05:11.311 --> 05:13.897
find somebody else to sit
in your little log cabin safe house

05:13.980 --> 05:15.315
out in the middle of nowhere.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.361
[sighs] Well, we appreciate your time.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.280
-Lieutenant. Ms. Paddock.
-Good luck, guys.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.866
For the record... not that it matters,

05:24.991 --> 05:27.494
but the safe house is not a cabin
in the woods.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.955
It's a penthouse suite
at the Four Seasons.

05:30.914 --> 05:31.832
The Four Seasons?

05:32.415 --> 05:33.875
Yeah, ma'am...

05:34.793 --> 05:36.920
We've actually fortified the entire floor.

05:37.045 --> 05:39.422
We use it for visiting dignitaries.

05:39.756 --> 05:41.675
It's where the President stays
when he's in town.

05:42.634 --> 05:43.927
This is all one suite?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.179
[man] For thousand square feet.

05:46.263 --> 05:50.225
Wet bar, Spa, massages...
24-hour room service.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.854
Penthouse suite until the trial?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.064
Yes, sir, until the trial is over.

05:56.314 --> 05:58.233
So we're talking two weeks.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.364
You know, on the other hand,

06:05.365 --> 06:06.950
I have an obligation...

06:07.576 --> 06:11.246
an obligation to society,
to the children...

06:11.872 --> 06:13.415
to the children of society.

06:14.666 --> 06:15.542
Is that a yes?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.253
Yeah, I'm in, I'll do it.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.006
Is there a pool?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.425
Ma'am, I'm sorry,

06:23.508 --> 06:26.136
but I'm afraid the offer
only extends to Mr. Caruso.

06:26.344 --> 06:27.721
And his immediate family.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.724
My immediate family?

between Tony Caruso
and Debbie Prescott.

-Paddock.
-Paddock. Even better.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.654
[Priest] Marriage is a commitment
not to be taken lightly.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.449
It is the highest form of love
between two people.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.160
-Big Tony, Debbie...
-[bar music playing]

06:50.243 --> 06:53.330

of your lives be a new beginning.

that makes both of you better people.

-[music playing]

07:13.934 --> 07:14.851
What are you doing?

07:15.310 --> 07:18.355
-Where'd you get this?
-Son. Please, not now.

07:18.897 --> 07:22.400
-"To my darling Fiona?"
-Look, it's not hot.

07:22.484 --> 07:23.860
-I bought it used.
-From who?

07:24.194 --> 07:26.154
What do you mean from who?
From a guy.

07:26.237 --> 07:27.864
-What guy?
-You don't know him.

07:27.948 --> 07:28.907
Who's the guy?

07:29.324 --> 07:30.742
Maury Plankton, okay?

07:31.159 --> 07:33.495
-Maury Plankton's dead.
-Maury Plankton is not dead.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.330
They found him in a trunk in Elmhurst.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.332
-That's his brother, Murray.
-He didn't have one.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.876
[Burl] He had a brother.
Murray was in the trunk.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.462
Maury is married to Stevie K's sister.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.839
Hard to say which one is better off.

07:46.132 --> 07:46.967
Are we good?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.136
Where'd you get that tux?

07:50.261 --> 07:51.596
[people complain]

07:51.680 --> 07:53.473
Would you sit down?

07:53.598 --> 07:57.435
By the power vested in me
by UniversalTabernacle.com,

07:57.519 --> 08:00.146
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.648
You may kiss the bride.

-[guest cheering and applauding]

08:03.984 --> 08:06.861
-[rock & roll music playing]
-[Debbie gasps]

08:14.369 --> 08:16.037
I always cry at weddings.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.748
-You're not crying.
-Exactly.

08:19.124 --> 08:22.168
This is more like a seminar on tax fraud
with an open bar.

08:22.919 --> 08:24.212
He's testifying against DeRosa,

08:24.295 --> 08:27.007
-That's the important thing.
-Hey, what's happening?

08:27.090 --> 08:28.550
How are you kids doing?
Having fun?

08:29.467 --> 08:31.302
I don't know what to say, Dad.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.805
How about, "Congratulations?"

08:35.223 --> 08:36.349
No, that's not it.

08:37.142 --> 08:41.021
-You always said I should get remarried.
-I was talking about a real marriage.

08:41.104 --> 08:42.939
This is real. It's real enough.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.233
-Real for two weeks.
-And then what?

08:45.316 --> 08:46.484
We get it annulled.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.610
No harm, no foul.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.446
I know, I feel a little guilty.

08:49.529 --> 08:52.323
But in a lot of ways,
it makes so much more sense

08:52.407 --> 08:53.867
than my last two marriages.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.243
Tony?

08:56.327 --> 08:57.996
-It's two o'clock.
-Alright.

08:58.246 --> 09:00.540
What do you say, sweetheart.
It's honeymoon time.

09:00.623 --> 09:03.001
-Hey Gordy, these paid for, right?
-All yours.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.629
-Sweetheart. Here you go, babe.
-There you go. Go ahead. Let's do it.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.381
Son... Love you.

-Alright, Dad.
-Okay, pal.

[all cheer and applaud]

09:19.559 --> 09:21.019
-It's for a good cause.
-Yeah.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.700
-[Tony Sr. laughs]
-[Debbie chuckles] Keep going.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.368
What? This is the threshold.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.495
That's it. Come on.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.916
[Debbie yells in amazement] Oh my gosh!

09:45.919 --> 09:49.506
We had your luggage brought up
this morning. That's the master bedroom...

09:49.589 --> 09:52.842
bathroom, another bathroom,
and your breakfast nook.

09:52.967 --> 09:55.970
-What do you think?
-Well, if it's the best you could do...

09:56.930 --> 09:59.599
Agent Hodges and I will be
in the third bedroom down the hall.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.643
Special Agent Keith,
Special Agent Reinhardt.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.853
-They'll be in the CP just below us.
-[Debbie] "CP?"

10:03.937 --> 10:05.939
Command Post It's a 15 agent detail.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.982
Three teams of five,
working eight hour shifts.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.318
From this point on,
there'll be no outside communication.

10:10.401 --> 10:11.861
I will need your cellphones.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.447
-We can't call anyone?
-No ma'am.That's non-negotiable.

10:14.531 --> 10:18.118
But we're happy to forward any messages
or letters to your family.

10:18.201 --> 10:20.537
As I said...
You're safer than the President.

10:20.745 --> 10:23.081
We're 12 stories taller
than any building on the block.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.583
The FAA is banning any flights
within a one mile radius.

10:25.708 --> 10:27.085
I'm afraid to sit down.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.170
-Is that real gold?
-Yes, ma'am.

10:29.254 --> 10:31.214
Actually, 24 carat gold thread.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.008
-[Debbie yells]
-We're going to need another suitcase.

10:34.092 --> 10:36.052
The skylight in the bedroom
has been sealed

10:36.136 --> 10:39.264
with alloy bars and intrusion alarms...
Doors and the floor have been replaced.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.349
The new ones are bulletproof
and blast-proof.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.226
This is Maria Starkey.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.103
-She'll be your housekeeper.
-Hi.

10:45.270 --> 10:46.396
-Hello.
-Hello, Maria.

10:46.521 --> 10:47.772
Maria, I love that name.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.317
That was my father's name. [laughs]
Wait, I have something for you, Maria.

Miss Starkey has been thoroughly vetted.

11:07.417 --> 11:11.212
She's one of five hotel employees
who will have access to the floor.

11:13.298 --> 11:14.632
A Jacuzzi.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.135
How do you turn it on?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.971
There's a control panel
right by the faucet, there.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.514
As I was saying,

11:21.598 --> 11:23.850
we have our own generator
and backup generator.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.602
In addition, we have agents
in the kitchen--

11:25.768 --> 11:26.728
Any bubble bath?

11:26.811 --> 11:28.771
You know, ma'am,
I think it makes its own bubbles.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.774
You know, my wife loves her bubbles.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.694
Maria, why don't we pick up
some bubble bath for Mrs. Caruso.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.363
And also, Maria, please,
some food for my dog Byron.

11:37.447 --> 11:38.323

11:40.366 --> 11:42.368
And you know what? I forgot my cigars.

11:42.535 --> 11:43.828

11:43.953 --> 11:46.039
There's no smoking in the hotel.
I'm sorry.

11:47.165 --> 11:50.043
You know, Greg I tell you what,
I'm going to make you a little deal.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.587
I'm going to smoke a stogie or two,
and in exchange,

11:52.670 --> 11:54.923
you and your posse get to slam the door

11:55.006 --> 11:57.592

in the city's history.

11:57.675 --> 11:58.509
What do you say?

12:00.011 --> 12:02.513
And a box of Montecristos for Mr. Caruso.

12:04.933 --> 12:07.810
While we're on the subject,
the US Attorney sent these over.

12:07.894 --> 12:10.480
Notes for your testimony.
She wants you to start reviewing it.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.814
Sure, I will. I'll get to them.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.858
She's highlighted the questions
you must look at.

12:13.983 --> 12:17.779
Just put them down. I'll get to it.
Sweetheart, what channel's that game on?

Man, you stand there like you're stuck.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.419
I wonder how the newlyweds are doing.

12:33.544 --> 12:36.714
I'll tell you this, Gordon,
you gave them a hell of a send-off.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.550
If I get married again,
I'm doing it right here.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.095
How many times you been married, Burl?

12:42.470 --> 12:44.013
Depends on how you count it.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.349
I've been married three times,

12:46.432 --> 12:49.435
but number one and number three
were the same woman.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.145
Who was number two?

-You got him.

13:02.949 --> 13:05.159
You work for Tony Caruso's son?
That's right.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.328
I'm Stork. They call me Stork.

13:07.412 --> 13:08.705
What the hell was that?

13:09.539 --> 13:11.291
They haven't converted all night.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.585
I worked for Remy DeRosa.
I know how they're going to get Big Tony.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.296
I know the plan.
They have somebody inside.

13:16.379 --> 13:18.131
Where's the flag?

13:26.973 --> 13:27.849
Call me tomorrow.

-Don't wait too long.
-Sure, kid. Thanks, I'll call you.

13:33.062 --> 13:33.896

13:34.314 --> 13:36.149
That ball hit the ground, man.

Come on.

13:37.275 --> 13:39.235
Where's the flag?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.112
Just can't catch a break tonight,
can they?

13:41.195 --> 13:42.780
They can't catch a football,

13:42.864 --> 13:44.032
that's for damn sure.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.491

It's been in my desk.
I have mixed feelings about it.

14:08.389 --> 14:10.600
-You're proud of him.
-I feel something.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.393
It might be pride.

14:12.477 --> 14:16.606
Listen, I think we have a problem.
I have a friend at Homeland Security.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.399

-It's a he.

Yeah. He's saying your dad might be

14:25.448 --> 14:27.241
in more danger
than the feds are letting on.

14:29.035 --> 14:31.245
DeRosa has been known
to pay a hundred grand,

14:31.329 --> 14:33.331
sometimes 200, to have witnesses killed.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.416
Guess how much he's offering
for your father?

14:35.958 --> 14:36.793
Half a million?

14:37.543 --> 14:38.669
Nothing. Zero.

14:38.920 --> 14:41.506
He had a contract,
but he cancelled it yesterday.

14:42.173 --> 14:44.634
That means he's confident.
He doesn't need the extra help.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.012
-Word is, he's got someone on the inside.
-Inside what? The hotel?

Brian doesn't know.
I'm seeing him again tonight.

It's possible.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.956
I think that's why married men
live longer.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.332
Or does it just seem longer?

20:09.959 --> 20:10.876

Just try it.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.346
For the novelty of it.

21:05.389 --> 21:06.348
There was a breach.

That's a hell of a breach.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.396
The agents in charge
have been reassigned.

21:12.480 --> 21:15.733
That's very reassuring.
But that's not the answer I'm looking for.

21:17.902 --> 21:20.863
-My father's in the crosshairs up there.
-Your father's safe.

21:20.946 --> 21:22.823
You've seen the penthouse.
It's impenetrable.

21:22.907 --> 21:25.534
-It's the Fortress of Solitude.
-Are you sweeping for explosives?

21:25.659 --> 21:26.577
Twice a day.

21:26.952 --> 21:29.121
-What about the housekeeper?
-I vetted her myself.

21:29.205 --> 21:31.040
She's worked with us
on five other details.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.210
We've been told that DeRosa
has somebody on the inside.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.170
-Not possible.
-It's a credible source.

21:36.253 --> 21:37.254
Not possible.

21:38.422 --> 21:40.132
There are 18 other safe houses
in New York.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.510
DeRosa has no idea
which one your father's in.

21:43.761 --> 21:44.762
Nobody's getting to him.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.639
You have my word.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.065
He still hasn't peed.

21:56.273 --> 21:57.274
He usually doesn't.

21:58.484 --> 21:59.944
He just wants to get out of there.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.574

22:28.681 --> 22:29.765
[bartender] Buzzy Mayberry?

22:29.890 --> 22:30.724
Yeah.

22:31.016 --> 22:31.851
He was here.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.185
Came in late.

22:33.727 --> 22:34.603
Like, after 2:00?

22:34.895 --> 22:35.896
Who'd he hang with?

22:35.980 --> 22:37.106
Anyone in particular?

22:37.857 --> 22:38.691
[shouts] Jolene!

22:40.067 --> 22:41.610
He has a thing for Jolene.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.532
-Are you Jolene?
-Occassionally.

22:47.074 --> 22:49.326
Alright, I'm Detective Vasquez.

22:49.410 --> 22:50.744
This is Sergeant Loomis.

22:50.911 --> 22:53.247
Do you know a customer
by the name of the Buzzy Mayberry?

22:53.414 --> 22:55.624
Only from the club.
I don't know him in the real world.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.293
At the moment we're not looking for him.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.545
We're looking for a dollar bill
he might have given you.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.546
A dollar bill?

23:00.880 --> 23:02.131
I know it sounds crazy.

23:02.214 --> 23:05.217
-It's a particular dollar bill.
-It has a phone number written on it.

23:05.301 --> 23:06.135
In red ink?

23:06.218 --> 23:08.637
Yeah, the red ink.
I was wondering about that.

23:08.804 --> 23:09.680
Hold on.

23:11.015 --> 23:11.849
It's here.

23:15.978 --> 23:16.812
Sorry.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.244
The laundromat.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.705
The 24-hour laundromat on Vincent Street.

23:34.830 --> 23:36.290
I stopped by on my way home.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.792
That's just up the block.
Would you mind coming with us?

23:38.876 --> 23:41.211
-Can we wait until after my set?
-Sure, we can wait.

23:41.295 --> 23:42.463
We'd rather go now.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.214
-We've got time.
-We've got to go.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.926
-How long is your set?
-[Cora] It doesn't matter. Get your coat.

23:50.679 --> 23:51.680
How long?

23:52.973 --> 23:53.807
Yeah.

23:54.391 --> 23:56.268
Those movies drive me crazy.

23:56.352 --> 23:59.813
[guard] <i>The Christmas Miracle.</i>
Plus, it has Reese Witherspoon.

23:59.897 --> 24:02.066
-so you know it's good.
-I've been wanting to see that.

24:02.149 --> 24:03.692
I think I'd rather chew glass.

24:03.776 --> 24:06.111
[guard] Why don't we watch the trailer?
Then we can decide.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.155
I'm not kidding. I think I'd kill myself.

24:09.239 --> 24:11.367
How about this? We have two TVs.

24:11.575 --> 24:14.578
So, Debbie can watch Reese Witherspoon
in the bedroom.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.830
Tony can watch <i>Goodfellas</i> out here.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.332
Hey, that sounds fair.

24:18.415 --> 24:19.583
We each get our own TV.

24:19.833 --> 24:22.920
It's, like, Biblical.
It's, like, King Solomon. [laughs]

24:24.088 --> 24:24.922
What now?

24:25.214 --> 24:27.174
Why are we here if we're not together?

24:27.508 --> 24:30.135
Of course, we're together.
We're trapped in here.

24:30.219 --> 24:31.637
We're like cellmates.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.764
Who's more together than us?

24:34.223 --> 24:35.599
Kevin talk to her.

24:35.683 --> 24:36.809
You talk to me, Tony.

24:36.892 --> 24:38.936
How about that?
How about you talk to me?

24:40.270 --> 24:41.522

24:47.319 --> 24:48.153

24:50.990 --> 24:52.616
We've been checking the phone all day.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.910

26:02.603 --> 26:04.730
-Hello.
-Hello.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.524
-Thank you for coming.
-[TJ] Of course.

26:07.608 --> 26:09.610
[man starts crying]

26:11.361 --> 26:12.196
Are you okay?

26:12.279 --> 26:13.197
I'm just...

26:13.822 --> 26:15.616
I'm so happy to see you.

26:18.494 --> 26:19.411
Who are you?

26:20.788 --> 26:21.789
You don't know me.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.834
I'm Tony Caruso.
I'm a lieutenant with All-City Homicide.

26:26.168 --> 26:27.753
To be honest, Mr. Entwhistle,

26:28.545 --> 26:30.714
I'm not here to see you.
I picked your name...

26:30.839 --> 26:32.299
-at random.
-At random?

26:33.133 --> 26:36.595
I'm here to see that gentleman over there,
but I don't have permission. So...

26:36.678 --> 26:38.555
You were not here for me?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.100
I'm sorry.

26:41.725 --> 26:42.601
Well...

26:44.186 --> 26:45.854
As long as you made the trip...

26:46.772 --> 26:47.689
how's life?

26:47.981 --> 26:49.316
You look good.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.069
I'm so sorry, but I can't talk.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.029
You can't say hello?

26:54.905 --> 26:57.533
You're the first visitor
I've had in 18 years.

26:58.075 --> 27:01.453
My sister used to visit on my birthday.
I think she passed.

27:01.537 --> 27:02.788
She must have passed.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.582
I promise, when this is all done with...

27:06.041 --> 27:08.710
I'll come back for a real visit.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.087
No you won't.

27:10.504 --> 27:11.421
Excuse me.

27:17.678 --> 27:18.554
Hello.

27:19.805 --> 27:20.764
Sorry to interrupt.

27:21.056 --> 27:21.890
Excuse me?

27:22.307 --> 27:24.810
This won't take more than a minute.
I'm Lieutenant Tony Caruso.

27:24.977 --> 27:25.853
Tony Junior.

27:26.103 --> 27:27.271
I'll be damned.

27:27.563 --> 27:29.481
I don't think there's
any doubt about that, Remy.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.442
Lieutenant, you understand
I'm Remy's legal counsel.

27:32.568 --> 27:33.902
This is a privileged conversation.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.321
This will take a minute.
I have an offer for your client.

27:36.405 --> 27:39.533
-One that I'm sure he'll want to hear.
-[councelor] On whose authority?

27:40.075 --> 27:43.120
-Did John Spector send you?
-No ma'am, I don't know who that is.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.079
I came on my own.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.290
-I'm calling the guards.
-Wait a minute.

27:47.624 --> 27:48.959
I must say, I'm intrigued.

27:51.086 --> 27:51.962
Give us a minute.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.423
I highly recommend
you don't have this convers--

27:54.882 --> 27:55.757
It's okay.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.225
So...

28:06.268 --> 28:08.812
what did you bring me?
The key to the front gate?

28:08.896 --> 28:10.147
[TJ laughs and sighs]

28:10.272 --> 28:12.357
I'm sorry, I can't offer you that, but...

28:13.692 --> 28:14.776
I can help Milo.

28:15.360 --> 28:16.195
My brother.

28:17.196 --> 28:18.155
I know he's sick.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.116
My college's roommate
is the chief diagnostician

28:21.200 --> 28:23.994
at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota.
I just got off the phone with him.

28:24.369 --> 28:25.829
I can get your brother a new kidney.

28:26.872 --> 28:27.873
I can save his life.

28:29.541 --> 28:30.876
In exchange for...

28:32.836 --> 28:33.795
Take the plea.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.840
You'll get five to ten,
you'll be out in seven.

28:36.924 --> 28:40.010
-That's less time than my father did.
-And there'll be no case, and...

28:40.093 --> 28:41.762
your old man would be off the hook.

28:46.808 --> 28:48.769
[laughs] Sorry, no deal.

28:49.686 --> 28:50.646
See the truth is...

28:50.896 --> 28:52.522
my brother means nothing to me.

28:53.023 --> 28:54.900
I haven't talked to him in 20 years.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.194
He's a fart in a dust storm.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.197
How's your old man?

29:02.282 --> 29:03.659
Is he enjoying the Four Seasons?

29:07.204 --> 29:10.249
I hear that they have
a serious rat problem.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.877
Maybe someone will do
something about that.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.923
Come on, please open the door.

29:18.215 --> 29:20.133
Okay. I apologize.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.261
I don't know what I did,
but I'm apologizing.

29:22.344 --> 29:25.305
[Debbie] That's the whole problem.
You don't know what you did.

29:25.430 --> 29:28.767
Maybe I'll find a mind reader...
so he can tell me what I did.

29:28.850 --> 29:29.935
[Debbie] Go to hell, Tony.

29:30.018 --> 29:32.479
When's the hitman coming?
I hope he has good aim.

29:33.188 --> 29:34.481
This is the third, right?

29:34.564 --> 29:35.565
Today's the third.

29:37.693 --> 29:38.610
What did you say?

29:39.152 --> 29:39.987
What?

29:40.070 --> 29:42.823
You just asked him what day it was.
You think this is PMS?

29:42.906 --> 29:43.991
You think it's my hormones?

29:44.074 --> 29:45.534
-It's not your fault?
-I didn't say--

29:45.617 --> 29:47.869
You are ridiculous.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.538
You know that? You're like...

29:49.621 --> 29:51.164
one of those canker sores

29:51.248 --> 29:53.750
-that won't go away.
-Come on.

29:55.877 --> 29:58.880
By the way, there's only one way
you're getting laid tonight.

29:59.172 --> 30:02.426
You're going to crawl
up a chicken's butt and wait.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.221
How you doing?

30:06.596 --> 30:07.806
I'm living the dream.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.975
Not my dream,
some poor schmuck's dream.

30:10.058 --> 30:11.560
Good. I need to talk to you.

30:15.522 --> 30:17.149
What's happening here?
Where's Maria?

30:17.441 --> 30:19.276
She went home sick.
What's going on?

30:19.359 --> 30:20.360
He knows he's here.

30:20.444 --> 30:22.362
-Who knows he's here?
-Remy DeRosa knows.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.614
-Cite your source.
-Cite my source?

30:24.698 --> 30:26.158
Remy DeRosa. I just talked to him.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.243
You went to the prison?
On whose authority?

30:28.327 --> 30:30.537
Upon myself. You would have done the same
for your father.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.039
Alright, guys. Let's not overreact.

30:32.372 --> 30:35.459
No, Kevin, I think overreacting
is the appropriate response right now.

30:35.542 --> 30:37.252
Lieutenant, even if it's true,

30:37.377 --> 30:40.255
relocating right now would be
more dangerous than hunkering down.

30:41.340 --> 30:43.342
We'll double the detail,
we'll expand the perimeter.

31:17.918 --> 31:20.003
Yeah... I remember that one.

31:20.170 --> 31:21.963
I didn't deposit that one.

31:22.255 --> 31:23.799
I didn't think the bank would take it.

31:23.882 --> 31:24.925
-You didn't deposit it?
-No.

31:25.050 --> 31:26.593
Good. What did you do with it?

Hold on, hold on.

-Close to it.

He did. It didn't make any sense.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.049
Something about a cigar.
