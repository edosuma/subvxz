WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:02.698
<i>Back in the '80s,</i>

00:02.872 --> 00:04.134
<i>high school was
a tricky place for me.</i>

00:04.308 --> 00:06.354
<i>I didn't always enjoy the
acceptance of my classmates,</i>

00:06.528 --> 00:08.660
<i>or the teachers,
or the principal,</i>

00:09.661 --> 00:11.750
<i>or the building.</i>

00:11.924 --> 00:13.839
<i>But I had applied
to my dream school
with my dream girl,</i>

00:14.014 --> 00:15.711
<i>and our envelopes from NYU
had arrived.</i>

00:15.885 --> 00:17.278
- Nervous?
- No.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.149
I'm cool as a cucumber

00:19.323 --> 00:22.283
that's been hot-brined
and barrel-aged
for maximum flavor.

00:22.457 --> 00:23.675
I'm your
special pickle, baby.

00:23.849 --> 00:25.416
Just part of the charm
of sharing this moment

00:25.590 --> 00:26.678
with your family
instead of my own.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.550
Pish-posh, Brea.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.247
Your mother's divorced.
She's got bigger fish to fry.

00:30.421 --> 00:31.466
These envelopes
are pretty thick.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.597
They say that's a good sign.

00:32.771 --> 00:33.859
Open the damn things, already!

00:34.034 --> 00:35.557
And tear!

00:37.646 --> 00:39.865
Oh, my God!
I got in!

00:40.040 --> 00:41.258
Sweet balls! So did I!

00:41.432 --> 00:42.520
"Dear Brea Bee..."

00:42.694 --> 00:43.826
"Dear Beverly Goldberg..."

00:44.000 --> 00:45.697
Wait, yours says
"Beverly Goldberg."

00:45.871 --> 00:47.395
Ah, that's probably
just a typo.

00:47.569 --> 00:50.354
Whoo-hoo! We did it, Bevy!
They're in college!

00:50.528 --> 00:52.008
Now they're
society's problem.

00:52.182 --> 00:53.749
I'm supposed to go
to NYU as her?

00:53.923 --> 00:55.794
Oh, look at
Mr. Big Pants here.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.622
Too good to go
to college as his mom.

00:57.796 --> 00:58.884
How would that even work?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.364
We'll "Tootsie" you.

01:00.538 --> 01:03.541
Bevy, get me a sparkling
red dress, some curlers,

01:03.715 --> 01:05.108
and a bucket of makeup.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.893
I need answers.
Why does NYU think I'm you?

01:08.068 --> 01:09.939
Surprise! I applied
to NYU and got in.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.462
Yay! Dreams do come true.

01:11.636 --> 01:13.377
Do they? Do they?

01:13.551 --> 01:15.814
I mean, did I want to
spend the next four years

01:15.988 --> 01:17.599
with my baby as
his best friend/study buddy?

01:17.773 --> 01:18.861
Of course I did.

01:19.035 --> 01:20.776
Did I think it would
actually happen?

01:20.950 --> 01:21.951
Of course, again.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.692
And you thought this
was a good idea?

01:23.866 --> 01:26.216
What I was thinking is that
he shouldn't go to

01:26.390 --> 01:28.131
his dream school
without his dream girl.

01:28.305 --> 01:29.611
- I'm gonna go.
- Run.

01:29.785 --> 01:32.004
I would, too, if I didn't have
exercise-related asthma.

01:32.179 --> 01:35.138
See you around the student
union, fellow Bobcat.

01:35.312 --> 01:36.966
Roar!

01:37.140 --> 01:38.750
Found a letter for you, Adam.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.144
It was wedged in the pages
of my <i>Us Weekly.</i>

01:41.318 --> 01:43.494
There's an article about
the guy inside Chewbacca.

01:43.668 --> 01:45.888
Damn it,
will you just give him
the obviously tragic news?

01:46.062 --> 01:47.368
Okay, but it's thin.

01:49.370 --> 01:50.806
I'm on the wait list.

01:50.980 --> 01:53.113
It's not a total rejection.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.202
Remember when we went to
Benihana for Erica's birthday

01:55.376 --> 01:56.899
and we got on the wait list?

01:57.073 --> 01:58.118
We ultimately got in.

01:58.292 --> 02:00.381
At 9:45.

02:00.555 --> 02:03.253
Dad fell asleep
and burnt his forehead
on the grill table.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.647
And they were out of
hibachi butter garlic shrimp.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.779
All they had was hibachi
butter sea salt shrimp.

02:07.953 --> 02:09.999
Why even call yourself
a place of business?

02:10.173 --> 02:11.348
Damn it, Bevy,
you gotta fix this!

02:11.522 --> 02:12.480
Don't worry.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.786
Just like I wrote
in my NYU essay,

02:14.960 --> 02:18.921
I'm a glass-half-full gal
who enjoys problem solving.

02:19.095 --> 02:21.924
You better.
I am so frickin'
worked up right now!

02:22.098 --> 02:22.751
Ahh!

02:23.578 --> 02:24.883
It's too thick.

02:25.057 --> 02:26.711
So many words of acceptance!

02:28.452 --> 02:30.062
<i>♪ I'm twisted up inside</i>

02:30.237 --> 02:33.240
<i>♪ But nonetheless
I feel the need to say</i>

02:36.025 --> 02:37.766
<i>♪ I don't know the future</i>

02:37.940 --> 02:41.465
<i>♪ But the past keeps getting
clearer every day ♪</i>

02:41.639 --> 02:43.250
<i>It was September 29,
1980-something,</i>

02:43.424 --> 02:45.469
<i>which was Geoff's
dad's birthday.</i>

02:45.643 --> 02:47.123
<i>And Erica
was a little nervous.</i>

02:47.297 --> 02:48.255
Are you sure
he's gonna like it?

02:48.429 --> 02:49.517
How could he not?

02:49.691 --> 02:51.127
You found a way to combine
his love of racehorses

02:51.301 --> 02:52.824
with his awareness
of pillows.

02:52.998 --> 02:53.999
It's just that now
I'm officially gonna be

02:54.174 --> 02:55.479
a part of the family,

02:55.653 --> 02:56.567
I really need your dad
to like me.

02:56.741 --> 02:59.004
Don't be silly,
you silly silly.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.049
That's way too many
sillies, Geoff.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.006
That's always
been your tell.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.486
So silly.

03:02.660 --> 03:04.140
<i>But over the years,</i>

03:04.314 --> 03:06.229
<i>Geoff's dad had hardly
been Erica's number-one fan.</i>

03:06.403 --> 03:08.753
Why are you mowing my lawn?
It's the middle of the winter!

03:08.927 --> 03:10.146
Who gives the gift of song
when the gift of song

03:10.320 --> 03:11.887
has already been given?

03:12.061 --> 03:13.715
The only reason Geoff is
in this mess is because

03:13.889 --> 03:16.370
of your terrible influence,
and it stops now.

03:17.588 --> 03:18.981
Silly memories!

03:19.155 --> 03:20.417
Happy birthday, Lou!

03:20.591 --> 03:22.680
Please, dear.
It's Dr. Lou Schwartz.

03:22.854 --> 03:23.986
Anyway, I made you this.

03:24.639 --> 03:25.901
Oh.

03:26.075 --> 03:27.685
A pillow with a horse on it.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.732
That is Triple Crown winner
Seattle Slew.

03:30.906 --> 03:33.213
That muscular thoroughbred
took me 19 days to sew,

03:33.387 --> 03:35.389
and he tossed it
in the broom closet.

03:35.563 --> 03:36.520
That's where he tosses
all his favorite gifts.

03:36.694 --> 03:38.348
Louie!

03:38.522 --> 03:41.482
Erica's birthday airball
is the perfect segue

03:41.656 --> 03:42.570
to my gift.

03:42.744 --> 03:43.919
This is very exciting!

03:44.093 --> 03:46.008
This certificate
entitles the bearer

03:46.182 --> 03:47.749
to one...

03:47.923 --> 03:50.404
...game of Horse against me,
which I will dominate.

03:50.578 --> 03:53.363
To be arranged around
Barry's schedule and mood.

03:53.537 --> 03:55.060
And Horse tracks with
my love of horses.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.758
Is that a Bomb Pop wrapper?

03:56.932 --> 03:58.499
It doesn't matter
what it's on,

03:58.673 --> 04:00.718
it's a sacred covenant
between two men.

04:00.892 --> 04:02.329
One of whom
has a blue tongue.

04:02.503 --> 04:04.113
Hope you saved some room
for my famous waffles.

04:04.287 --> 04:07.464
I did not,
but that won't stop me.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.076
Oh, God.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.339
What the hell was that?

04:12.513 --> 04:13.601
Hey, who else
heard "waffles,"

04:13.775 --> 04:14.863
the pancake's
geometric cousin?

04:15.037 --> 04:16.386
Stop. He hated my gift.

04:16.560 --> 04:18.301
Obviously.

04:18.475 --> 04:20.260
A horse pillow?
After what you did?

04:20.434 --> 04:22.523
What did I do? Geoff?

04:22.697 --> 04:24.568
Oh, come on. You know.
It was high school.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.004
My parents were out of town.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.963
Joanne threw that party,
and you took my dad's

04:28.137 --> 04:29.878
two prized porcelain
Clydesdales and...

04:30.052 --> 04:30.792
Posed them like
they were doing it.

04:30.966 --> 04:32.054
What? No, I didn't.

04:32.228 --> 04:34.578
Oh, why are you denying it?

04:34.752 --> 04:37.015
Okay, it was the one moment
in our lives

04:37.189 --> 04:38.843
I actually respected you.

04:39.017 --> 04:41.846
That's why
your dad's been cold
to me all these years?

04:42.020 --> 04:43.544
Because of some little
horsy hanky-panky?

04:43.718 --> 04:44.893
Not just that.

04:45.067 --> 04:47.287
Turned out when he separated
the delicate figurines,

04:47.461 --> 04:48.766
Champ had broken
his hind leg.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.507
- Champ?
- Champ and Dottie.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.030
They're actually
brother and sister.

04:52.204 --> 04:53.641
Anyway, he was able to
glue it back on,

04:53.815 --> 04:55.295
but you could still see
the tiny fracture,

04:55.469 --> 04:56.557
or at least my dad could.

04:56.731 --> 04:59.299
Well, I'm so sorry
for him and Champ,

04:59.473 --> 05:01.257
but why would anyone
think that was me?

05:01.431 --> 05:02.389
'Cause Joanne saw you do it.

05:02.563 --> 05:04.042
- Uh-huh.
- Well, she couldn't have,

05:04.216 --> 05:05.827
because I wasn't even
at that party.

05:06.001 --> 05:08.133
Oh, I know what happened.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.483
I did it and said
that it was you.

05:09.657 --> 05:10.571
What?

05:10.745 --> 05:12.050
Yep. I'm a scamp.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.313
But all's well that
ends well.

05:13.487 --> 05:14.792
Yes.

05:14.966 --> 05:16.533
As if I needed
any more proof
I'm with the right lady.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.883
Aww. Waffles, babe.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.842
<i>While Erica
had learned she had
taken the fall for Joanne,</i>

05:21.016 --> 05:23.061
<i>my mom was ready to
spring into action.</i>

05:23.235 --> 05:24.367
We need to talk.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.064
So sorry in advance.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.415
Damn it, door,
you have one job!

05:28.589 --> 05:30.242
Are you eating your own
personal pan cookie?

05:30.417 --> 05:31.374
I eat one every day.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.202
That seems like
too much.

05:33.376 --> 05:35.160
Does being happy
seem like too much?

05:35.335 --> 05:37.424
Enough about the man's
giant daily cookie.

05:37.598 --> 05:40.165
Adam was wait listed at NYU.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.080
And here's another headline,
she got in.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.212
But you're his mother.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.519
She got the big envelope
and everything.

05:45.693 --> 05:47.782
All my ears and whiskers!
The big envelope?

05:47.956 --> 05:49.044
That's the real deal.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.437
Well, it's nice to be wanted,

05:50.611 --> 05:52.613
but we're hoping,
as his guidance counselor,

05:52.787 --> 05:54.310
you can arrange for him
to take my spot.

05:54.484 --> 05:56.356
What a fun
and outlandish solution.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.708
Unfortunately, the world
doesn't work that way at all.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.710
Brea's gonna have to
give you her spot.

06:02.884 --> 06:03.972
Now, do you want to
talk to her,

06:04.146 --> 06:05.756
- or is that a Mama-do?
- Not that, either.

06:05.930 --> 06:08.803
Mr. G, NYU is my dream school.
I'll do anything.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.893
I get it, but the admissions
people need to get it, too.

06:12.067 --> 06:13.677
Fine. Adam, we're gonna
get you into college,

06:13.851 --> 06:14.896
but first, go make a pishy.

06:15.070 --> 06:15.679
It's gonna be a long drive.

06:15.853 --> 06:16.854
You both can't go.

06:17.028 --> 06:17.986
You're right.

06:18.160 --> 06:19.335
Schmoo,
wait for me at home.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.206
No stove or scissors
till I get back.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.382
Please listen.

06:22.556 --> 06:25.254
It has to be Adam
and Adam alone.

06:25.428 --> 06:26.211
The admissions people
need to see that

06:26.386 --> 06:28.475
he can advocate for himself.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.652
Or I call them and tell them
how good he is

06:31.826 --> 06:33.393
at advocating for himself.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.699
There you go, Mama.
No wonder you got in.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.048
Adam needs to do this
on his own.

06:37.222 --> 06:39.311
- But with his mama.
- No.

06:39.486 --> 06:41.705
Looks like it's time
for this guy to step up.

06:41.879 --> 06:44.055
But first, she was right
about that pishy.

06:44.229 --> 06:45.709
<i>I had gotten some
much-needed clarity,</i>

06:45.883 --> 06:47.537
<i>but Erica was still confused.</i>

06:47.711 --> 06:49.496
Not only am I wrongly blamed

06:49.670 --> 06:51.106
for putting your father's
porcelain horses

06:51.280 --> 06:52.890
in unspeakable positions,

06:53.064 --> 06:54.501
but worse,
you thought I did it.

06:54.675 --> 06:55.980
Well, in my defense,

06:56.154 --> 06:57.721
I actually kind of liked
that you did it.

06:57.895 --> 06:58.635
What are you saying
right now?

06:58.809 --> 07:00.202
I'm saying I like bad girls.

07:00.376 --> 07:01.682
Like Olivia Newton-John
in <i>Grease,</i>

07:01.856 --> 07:02.944
when she was pretending
to be someone she wasn't.

07:03.118 --> 07:04.424
Ooh-la-la.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.077
Oh, my God.
You don't even know
what a bad girl is.

07:06.251 --> 07:09.211
Hey! Ooh, that horse shindig
was fun, wasn't it?

07:09.385 --> 07:11.343
The hell it was.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.737
Oh, are you still upset
I haven't told my dad
I made his ponies dirty?

07:13.911 --> 07:15.696
That was like
30 minutes ago.
Get over it.

07:15.870 --> 07:17.480
It's been years,

07:17.654 --> 07:19.656
years of your
father's passive
aggressive resentment.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.310
You have to tell him.

07:21.484 --> 07:24.269
I hear you,
but here's the thing,
I don't want to.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.880
See, things used to be
pretty tense

07:26.054 --> 07:27.534
between me and old Lou.

07:27.708 --> 07:29.187
You know how
he calls me Jojo now?

07:29.361 --> 07:31.581
Well, he used to call me
a bad girl.

07:31.755 --> 07:33.409
Like Olivia Newton-John
in <i>Grease.</i>

07:33.583 --> 07:35.846
Have either of you
actually seen that movie?

07:36.020 --> 07:38.022
Like when she comes back
with those black pants,

07:38.196 --> 07:39.023
and her hair's all piled up?

07:39.197 --> 07:40.503
Ooh-la-la, right?

07:40.677 --> 07:42.810
Erica, you wouldn't want
a silly thing

07:42.984 --> 07:44.681
like the truth getting between
a father and a daughter.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.161
Especially now.

07:46.335 --> 07:48.511
I mean, things between us
have never been better.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.774
Still, all the
negative feelings that
he would have had for you,

07:50.948 --> 07:52.428
he's had for me.

07:52.602 --> 07:54.038
In my defense,
I never thought
you'd figure it out.

07:54.212 --> 07:57.346
Well, I have, and now
my relationship with your dad

07:57.520 --> 07:59.435
is just supposed to suffer
for the rest of my life?

07:59.609 --> 08:02.046
No. Just until he dies.
Or you die.

08:02.220 --> 08:03.961
Or I die.

08:04.135 --> 08:05.397
God, it's funny how
death is the answer
to so many problems.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.704
I have the perfect solution.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.227
We can't let Erica
take the blame,

08:09.401 --> 08:10.881
- because she didn't do it.
- Thank you.

08:11.055 --> 08:12.013
And we can't let Joanne
take the blame,

08:12.187 --> 08:13.493
because she's adorably
difficult.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.711
I got the right fella.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.408
- Then who, Barry?
- Someone else.

08:16.583 --> 08:17.801
Well, that narrows it down.

08:17.975 --> 08:19.368
You need specifics?

08:19.542 --> 08:20.717
- Buddy Kaplan.
- Who?

08:20.891 --> 08:23.503
He was this huge math geek
in our class.

08:23.677 --> 08:25.113
God only knows
what happened to him.

08:25.287 --> 08:26.375
We throw the blame
on Buddy,

08:26.549 --> 08:27.594
and all of Erica's
problems are solved.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.030
This can't be
our best option.

08:29.204 --> 08:30.205
I like it.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.467
Yeah, because
it's not you.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.600
God, I just love
how close we're getting.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.645
<i>Yep, Joanne refused
to plead guilty.</i>

08:35.819 --> 08:38.474
<i>Meanwhile,
I was making my case to NYU.</i>

08:38.648 --> 08:40.563
Excuse me, Dean Martin?

08:40.737 --> 08:42.478
I'm wait listed applicant
Adam F. Goldberg.

08:42.652 --> 08:43.827
I have an appointment.

08:44.001 --> 08:45.960
Ah, yes. Mr. Goldberg.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.091
Here we are.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.485
We'll let you know.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.008
That's quicker
than I expected.

08:51.182 --> 08:52.662
Well, there's not
really a lot to say.

08:52.836 --> 08:54.577
It's just a process
that needs to play itself out.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.187
But you got to
let me in.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.799
I'm totally
NYU Film School material.

08:58.973 --> 09:00.888
Perhaps you missed
my killer essay?

09:01.062 --> 09:03.194
Was it about the first time
you held a video camera

09:03.368 --> 09:05.414
and you knew what
you wanted to do
with your life?

09:05.588 --> 09:06.763
Wow. I guess
it really stood out.

09:06.937 --> 09:07.851
It didn't.

09:08.025 --> 09:10.071
But I took the bus here.

09:10.245 --> 09:11.942
The guy next to me
had a snake.

09:12.116 --> 09:14.379
It wasn't a pet.
I think he just found it.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.860
Mr. Goldberg, the students
are admitted for a reason.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.733
I'm talking about
unique life stories,

09:19.907 --> 09:22.431
personal achievements,
overcoming obstacles.

09:22.605 --> 09:25.652
Did you not hear
my harrowing snake bus tale?

09:25.826 --> 09:27.828
I assume you're from
an upper-middle-class,
suburban family?

09:28.002 --> 09:30.047
Well, I wouldn't say upper.

09:30.221 --> 09:33.094
Both our houses,
regular and beach,
are fairly modest.

09:33.268 --> 09:35.096
We are looking for people
who have thrived

09:35.270 --> 09:37.054
despite real obstacles.

09:37.228 --> 09:39.187
I got a crazy amount of those.

09:39.361 --> 09:41.668
I just need a little time
to narrow them down.
But I'll be back.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.670
Or you'll patiently wait
for our response.

09:43.844 --> 09:46.673
Ha! I just got roasted
by Dean Martin.

09:46.847 --> 09:49.197
<i>So I gathered the people
who knew me best</i>

09:49.371 --> 09:52.461
<i>to remind me of some
of the many difficulties
I'd overcome.</i>

09:52.635 --> 09:54.332
Okay. Obstacles.
What do we got?

09:54.506 --> 09:56.247
Uh, that substitute
PE teacher

09:56.421 --> 09:57.945
did make you
jump rope in gym.

09:58.119 --> 10:00.512
Not really. I just had to
collect all the jump ropes.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.471
But they did get into
a nasty tangle

10:02.645 --> 10:04.952
which took well into
my snack period to undo.

10:05.126 --> 10:07.694
Oh, you were
the most beautiful
little boy in kindergarten.

10:07.868 --> 10:09.260
How is that an obstacle?

10:09.434 --> 10:11.480
Well, a lot of the other
parents got quite miffed

10:11.654 --> 10:12.916
'cause I kept saying it.

10:13.090 --> 10:14.439
You said beating
"The Legend of Zelda"

10:14.614 --> 10:16.137
took way longer
than you thought.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.269
You're thinking of "
The Adventure of Link," silly.

10:18.443 --> 10:20.271
Right. I am silly.

10:20.445 --> 10:21.621
What about that time
you were homesick
at space camp?

10:21.795 --> 10:23.100
Really, Dave Kim?

10:23.274 --> 10:25.189
You think my biggest challenge
was high-fiving

10:25.363 --> 10:27.191
American hero John Glenn?

10:27.365 --> 10:29.019
Is anybody seeing
an alarming trend?

10:29.193 --> 10:31.718
Video games, space camp.
Adam's kind of a nerd.

10:31.892 --> 10:33.720
Brea Bee,
I will run over your bike.

10:33.894 --> 10:36.810
Wait, she's right.
I am a nerd!

10:36.984 --> 10:38.986
No offense, man,
but you don't have
the grades to be a nerd.

10:39.160 --> 10:40.901
Better!
I'm an underachieving nerd.

10:41.075 --> 10:42.554
Yes!

10:42.729 --> 10:44.774
My baby will overcome
the sheltered privilege
I provided!

10:49.170 --> 10:50.388
<i>Joanne didn't want to
take the blame</i>

10:50.562 --> 10:51.651
<i>for disgracing Lou's horses,</i>

10:51.825 --> 10:53.174
<i>so they did
the next best thing</i>

10:53.348 --> 10:53.957
<i>and blamed
a complete stranger.</i>

10:54.131 --> 10:55.959
Buddy Kaplan? Really?

10:56.133 --> 10:57.569
That's what we're all
saying here, I guess.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.093
Mm-hmm.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.269
But more importantly,
I didn't do it,

11:01.443 --> 11:03.053
so you can now see me
as the wonderful addition

11:03.227 --> 11:05.186
to your family that I am
and we can all move on.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.231
I wish I could, but
Buddy Kaplan's my accountant.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.798
- You know him?
- Know him?

11:08.972 --> 11:10.539
We trust him with
our life savings.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.672
Not anymore!
I'm firing him immediately!

11:12.846 --> 11:13.760
You can't fire Buddy!

11:13.934 --> 11:14.978
He was a child then,

11:15.152 --> 11:17.067
and now he's an adult
with a child's name.

11:17.241 --> 11:18.199
Don't be stupid, son.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.331
Sure, he's got
four foster kids,

11:20.505 --> 11:22.769
but I'm not employing someone
who'd make my ponies

11:22.943 --> 11:25.293
perform acts against
their gentle nature.

11:25.467 --> 11:27.251
Who knew the fate
of so many lives

11:27.425 --> 11:28.818
could be affected
by those little
porcelain dolls?

11:28.992 --> 11:30.690
I know, right?

11:30.864 --> 11:33.214
A butterfly flaps its wings
in one part of the world,

11:33.388 --> 11:34.694
and now Buddy Kaplan
has to send his foster kids

11:34.868 --> 11:36.173
back into the system.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.697
It wasn't Buddy Kaplan.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.221
The person who did it was...

11:40.395 --> 11:41.962
Randy Sperling.

11:42.136 --> 11:43.050
Our lawyer?

11:43.224 --> 11:45.226
He and Buddy
set up our trust!

11:45.400 --> 11:47.794
Why are you guys insistent on
hiring so many young people?

11:47.968 --> 11:50.710
I am a sucker for a young man
in Haggar slacks.

11:50.884 --> 11:52.276
It is a handsome pant.

11:52.450 --> 11:54.235
But now we have to
let the whole team go.

11:54.409 --> 11:56.411
Fine. I'll tell you
who really did it,

11:56.585 --> 11:58.195
but your heart's
gonna be shattered
into a million pieces.

11:58.369 --> 11:59.283
It was me!

11:59.457 --> 12:00.458
Geoffrey?

12:00.632 --> 12:02.460
The able bearer
of the Schwartz name?

12:02.634 --> 12:04.549
That's right.
I'm a nasty boy,

12:04.724 --> 12:06.029
and I like nasty
horse business.

12:07.465 --> 12:08.815
Then show me, Geoffrey.

12:08.989 --> 12:12.296
Show me exactly
how the horses were posed.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.516
Well, they were...
They were face to face.

12:14.690 --> 12:16.910
And then their
giant horse lips met,

12:17.084 --> 12:18.738
and it was a magical,
consensual evening.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.348
Not even close.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.306
It was a tangle of
equine anatomy

12:22.480 --> 12:24.047
from muzzle
to hindquarters.

12:24.221 --> 12:25.962
Fine. Barry did it.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.659
- Really?
- Why not?

12:27.834 --> 12:30.488
If you ask me, you're both
covering for someone else.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.839
Lou, don't get yourself
worked up again.

12:33.013 --> 12:36.407
This is just about
some silly ceramic horses.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.323
I've seen them at trade shows
for over $75!

12:39.497 --> 12:41.238
- Each?
- For an unsullied pair,

12:41.412 --> 12:43.632
which these are
no longer, Erica.

12:43.806 --> 12:46.069
You know what?
It was me, actually.

12:46.243 --> 12:49.116
I took... I took
Champ and Dottie here

12:49.290 --> 12:51.422
and I mashed them together,
sexy-style.

12:51.596 --> 12:53.033
I just...

12:53.207 --> 12:54.774
- Ohh!
- My loving treasures!

12:54.948 --> 12:57.602
I'm sorry.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.170
At least now you have
a real reason to hate me.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.607
Happy birthday.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.654
<i>Erica's horseplay had put her
deeper in Lou's doghouse.</i>

13:05.828 --> 13:07.656
<i>Meanwhile, I was about to
give the dean</i>

13:07.830 --> 13:09.049
<i>a dog and pony show
of my own.</i>

13:09.223 --> 13:11.007
I figured out what
I've overcome.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.356
The need to knock when
you don't have an appointment?

13:12.530 --> 13:13.793
Zing, Deano.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.838
Actually, I'm here to
prove to you

13:16.012 --> 13:17.318
that I've endured
the greatest adversity

13:17.492 --> 13:18.493
in modern society.

13:18.667 --> 13:19.363
Nerdiness.

13:20.190 --> 13:21.278
I see.

13:21.452 --> 13:22.758
And who is this with you?

13:22.932 --> 13:25.021
This lovely lady is
my girlfriend

13:25.195 --> 13:27.894
and incoming
NYU freshman Brea Bee.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.896
She's here for moral
and easel support.

13:30.070 --> 13:31.941
So you're socially challenged,

13:32.115 --> 13:34.030
but somehow managed to land
this gorgeous woman?

13:34.204 --> 13:35.553
Please, she may be
a New York 10,

13:35.727 --> 13:36.554
but she's a Jenkintown 5.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.426
- Adam!
- Sorry!

13:38.600 --> 13:40.123
But the stakes are high!

13:40.297 --> 13:42.082
You know you're a fox.
Let me have a little sunshine.

13:42.256 --> 13:45.085
So you think NYU should
let you in because
you like <i>Star Wars?</i>

13:45.259 --> 13:46.434
More like love.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.700
That's R2-D2.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.920
- Brea, you're on.
- Nerd alert! Nerd alert!

13:54.094 --> 13:56.270
You do realize that <i>Star Wars</i>

13:56.444 --> 13:58.272
is the most popular movie
franchise of all time, right?

13:58.446 --> 14:00.317
But I, like, really like it.

14:00.491 --> 14:02.145
You also threw
"video games" up there.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.365
Isn't that something
every teenage boy enjoys?

14:04.539 --> 14:06.976
But I, like, really like them.

14:07.150 --> 14:08.717
You also wrote "glasses,"
something I wear.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.240
Are you saying that
I'm a nerd?

14:10.414 --> 14:11.981
Gah!

14:12.155 --> 14:13.983
Why is this impossible?
I mean, she got in.

14:14.157 --> 14:15.593
- Adam!
- You know what I mean.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.769
No, I don't, actually.

14:17.944 --> 14:19.771
I have better grades,
test scores,
and extracurriculars.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.382
Not to mention a better essay.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.513
That thing about divorce?

14:22.687 --> 14:24.776
Boo-hoo, you have
two Christmases.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.866
You know what?
Find someone else
to hold your easel.

14:27.040 --> 14:28.650
The easel
stands on its own.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.434
I needed you to
flip the pictures!

14:32.915 --> 14:36.179
So did I do it?
Am I in?

14:36.353 --> 14:38.094
<i>As my dreams of NYU
were crumbling,</i>

14:38.268 --> 14:40.401
<i>Lou was trying to
pick up the pieces</i>

14:40.575 --> 14:42.098
<i>of his little horses.</i>

14:42.272 --> 14:44.448
Champ's ear
is completely gone.

14:44.622 --> 14:46.363
The only silver lining is

14:46.537 --> 14:48.800
you can't hear
my despair, buddy.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.977
Ugh. It's time for me
to do the right thing.

14:51.151 --> 14:52.892
I've glued Champ's tail
to Dottie's snout.

14:53.066 --> 14:53.762
God forgive me.

14:53.936 --> 14:55.329
Daddy.

14:55.503 --> 14:57.505
I have some upsetting news.

14:57.679 --> 15:00.160
More upsetting than
the Frankenhorse
I just created?

15:00.334 --> 15:01.726
The truth is, it was me.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.380
What?

15:03.554 --> 15:05.817
I'm the one who originally
posed your ponies.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.471
So now you know
who to be angry with.

15:07.994 --> 15:08.995
Oh.

15:10.561 --> 15:11.998
It's water under the bridge.

15:12.172 --> 15:13.260
Wait, it is?

15:13.434 --> 15:16.219
Am I happy she broke them?
Of course not.

15:16.393 --> 15:19.527
But she was just a girl.
Kids make mistakes.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.268
But you've been
torturing Erica

15:21.442 --> 15:22.791
for years
over these horses,

15:22.965 --> 15:24.749
and suddenly
"kids make mistakes"?

15:24.924 --> 15:25.925
You're a mistake!

15:26.099 --> 15:27.970
I don't know
what that means,

15:28.144 --> 15:30.059
but I don't like
your aggressive tone.

15:30.233 --> 15:32.018
I don't know what
your problem is with Erica,

15:32.192 --> 15:35.282
but she's gonna be my wife,
and you better get over it.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.806
<i>While Geoff had finally
stood up to his dad,</i>

15:37.980 --> 15:39.590
<i>I was falling all over myself
trying to get Brea</i>

15:39.764 --> 15:40.417
<i>to forgive me.</i>

15:40.591 --> 15:43.072
Damn it!

15:43.246 --> 15:45.901
Careful, Schmoo,
you're gonna damage your
cheeseburger phone.

15:46.075 --> 15:48.077
What's the point of
a whimsical novelty item

15:48.251 --> 15:49.774
if the love of my life
won't talk to me?

15:49.949 --> 15:52.125
I'm right here. Oh.

15:52.299 --> 15:54.562
Here, let me make
everything better
with a forever hug.

15:54.736 --> 15:56.999
But it doesn't change the fact
that my life is ruined.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.261
We'll get you into
a better school,

15:58.435 --> 16:00.263
one that's even closer.

16:00.437 --> 16:02.831
For one second,
can you stop thinking about
how this affects you?

16:03.005 --> 16:06.226
It's my dream to go to NYU
with Brea.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.705
Now I don't have either.

16:07.879 --> 16:09.664
I'm sorry. I get it.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.622
Let's figure this out.

16:11.796 --> 16:13.929
Well, there's always
the classic big,
romantic gesture.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.583
That's brilliant.

16:15.757 --> 16:17.454
That fuss-bottom dean
will love that.

16:17.628 --> 16:18.890
I meant for Brea.

16:19.065 --> 16:21.458
But why not use
your seductive boy powers

16:21.632 --> 16:23.765
to charm your way into NYU?

16:23.939 --> 16:27.160
That's not an altogether
terrible idea.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.814
I have charmed my way
into the heart of many ladies

16:29.989 --> 16:31.729
who are way
out of my league.

16:31.903 --> 16:33.905
Why not
an academic institution?

16:34.080 --> 16:36.256
And the moment you
knock that dean sideways

16:36.430 --> 16:38.606
with your song and dance
razzle dazzle,

16:38.780 --> 16:40.216
she'll let you in,

16:40.390 --> 16:42.088
and Brea will be
right behind you.

16:42.262 --> 16:43.959
Well, that's impossibly
optimistic,

16:44.133 --> 16:45.091
but I got nothing else.

16:45.265 --> 16:47.615
Yay! Ha-ha!
Mama solved it.

16:47.789 --> 16:49.617
Your forever hug is now
forever kissies.

16:49.791 --> 16:50.618
Aw, no.

16:50.792 --> 16:52.098
The ones by my ears
are so loud.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.885
<i>Having fallen
further down NYU's wait list,</i>

16:57.059 --> 16:58.060
<i>it was time to take
a big swing.</i>

16:58.234 --> 16:58.887
Here we go.

16:59.061 --> 17:01.411
Oh, no.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.022
It's not another pathetic
attempt to beg my way in.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.110
Then what is it?

17:04.284 --> 17:05.024
It's this.

17:08.679 --> 17:11.117
Are you serenading me?

17:11.291 --> 17:13.510
Just let me and my pals
in the soft rock supergroup

17:13.684 --> 17:15.251
Foreigner explain everything.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.297
<i>♪ I've been waiting</i>

17:18.472 --> 17:20.735
<i>♪ For NYU</i>

17:20.909 --> 17:22.084
<i>♪ To come into ♪</i>

17:23.433 --> 17:25.653
And that's enough.

17:25.827 --> 17:28.743
Because you're swayed
by my passionate
musical appeal?

17:28.917 --> 17:30.571
I'm gonna give it
to you straight.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.312
I can't date an applicant.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.096
What? No! No, no, no, no.

17:34.270 --> 17:36.142
This romantic gesture
isn't a romantic gesture.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.187
Am I flattered? Yes.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.320
I mean, maybe even
a little curious.

17:40.494 --> 17:41.930
Oh, don't be.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.975
You know, I work late.
I live alone.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.152
I mean, and I'd be lying
if I said I didn't sometimes

17:46.326 --> 17:47.762
long for another's touch.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.459
Enough.
This stops here.

17:49.633 --> 17:51.461
Mom! You're supposed to
wait in the car!

17:51.635 --> 17:53.420
Did you not hear
his beautiful song?

17:53.594 --> 17:55.465
That is how much
he wants you.

17:55.639 --> 17:58.077
Hold on. You're his mother,
and you put him up to this?

17:58.251 --> 17:59.861
Damn right I did.

18:00.035 --> 18:02.777
My baby knows what he wants,
and I want him to have it.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.953
Mom, please!

18:05.127 --> 18:06.911
Remember what
Mr. Glascott said about
doing this on my own?

18:07.086 --> 18:09.262
To hell with Glascott.

18:09.436 --> 18:11.699
I got accepted into
this school with barely
a high school diploma.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.831
Wait, you applied to NYU
so you could

18:14.005 --> 18:16.747
go to college with your son,
and you got in?

18:16.921 --> 18:18.749
Let's just say
I get what I want,

18:18.923 --> 18:21.970
and right now, I want you
to do your job!

18:22.144 --> 18:23.189
That blazer's
disgusting.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.323
So...

18:27.497 --> 18:28.281
That's my mom.

18:28.890 --> 18:29.673
Wow.

18:29.847 --> 18:31.458
She's a lot.

18:31.632 --> 18:34.025
Maybe you have dealt with
a significant obstacle.

18:34.200 --> 18:35.375
What are you saying?

18:35.549 --> 18:38.160
I'm just saying maybe
I underestimated

18:38.334 --> 18:39.944
what you've
overcome in life.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.424
FYI, my dad's
no picnic either.

18:41.598 --> 18:43.209
You know what?

18:43.383 --> 18:44.993
I'm gonna give your
application another look.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.473
That's amazing!

18:46.647 --> 18:49.606
And just know, from now on,
my door is always shut.

18:49.780 --> 18:52.609
And you should know
that won't stop me.

18:52.783 --> 18:54.611
<i>With that,
I realized that,
thanks to my mom,</i>

18:54.785 --> 18:56.831
<i>I'd still have a shot at NYU.</i>

18:57.005 --> 18:59.138
<i>Yep, sometimes the people
we love help us</i>

18:59.312 --> 19:00.443
<i>in unexpected ways.</i>

19:00.617 --> 19:01.314
Hey.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.405
...Is for horses.
Don't remind me.

19:05.579 --> 19:07.450
Yeah, about that.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.235
Um, I've got someone here
who wants to talk to you.

19:10.105 --> 19:11.846
Dr. Lou Schwartz?

19:12.020 --> 19:13.413
Again, I am so,
so sorry.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.110
Call me Lou.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.851
And I'm the one
who should be apologizing.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.505
Wait, what?

19:18.679 --> 19:22.291
Look, Geoff
is my special boy.

19:22.465 --> 19:23.553
I love him
with all my heart.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.643
Me too.

19:26.817 --> 19:28.297
That's just it.

19:28.471 --> 19:30.560
When you started dating,
it just...

19:32.345 --> 19:35.086
I don't know,
felt like a loss.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.784
It's a parent thing.
It's hard to explain.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.570
I think I get it.

19:40.744 --> 19:44.313
But I took it out on you,
and that's unforgivable.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.533
No, it's not.

19:46.707 --> 19:48.970
Forgiving is
what family does.

19:49.144 --> 19:52.495
You know, Geoff has always
known what he's doing.

19:52.669 --> 19:56.369
I was worried that
I was losing my sweet son.

19:56.543 --> 19:59.589
Turns out, I was gaining
a wonderful daughter.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.461
Yep.

20:01.635 --> 20:02.853
I'm always right.

20:05.247 --> 20:07.510
<i>Truth is, we're all trying
to work through things.</i>

20:07.684 --> 20:10.078
<i>Sometimes, it's letting go
of mistakes from the past.</i>

20:10.252 --> 20:12.646
Don't do it.
Big, romantic gestures
don't always work.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.909
Believe me, I know.

20:15.083 --> 20:17.999
I'm just so sorry.

20:18.173 --> 20:20.480
The idea of not spending
the next four years with you

20:20.654 --> 20:22.308
has made me crazy,

20:22.482 --> 20:23.787
and I took it out
on the wrong person.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.269
Well, I guess that
kind of makes sense.

20:28.183 --> 20:29.880
I accept your apology.

20:30.054 --> 20:31.882
Will you also accept
my congratulations?

20:32.056 --> 20:33.797
I haven't told you
how happy and proud I am

20:33.971 --> 20:35.712
that you made it into NYU.

20:35.886 --> 20:37.192
They're so lucky to get you.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.238
Well, they're gonna be
lucky to get you, too.

20:39.412 --> 20:40.239
I'm not giving up hope.

20:40.413 --> 20:41.414
Me, neither.

20:45.896 --> 20:49.900
<i>And, sometimes,
it's holding on to dreams
of the future.</i>

20:50.074 --> 20:53.252
<i>In the end, when you have
the support of the people
who love you most,</i>

20:53.426 --> 20:55.515
<i>you're already
in the winner's circle.</i>

20:55.689 --> 20:58.431
<i>♪ To come into my life ♪</i>

21:01.303 --> 21:03.349
While our fingers
are crossed for NYU,

21:03.523 --> 21:05.481
let's take a look at
some of your back-ups.

21:05.655 --> 21:06.787
How do you feel about Tulane?

21:06.961 --> 21:08.789
Oh, New Orleans.

21:08.963 --> 21:12.488
Ah, the Big Easy.
Po'boys with my boy. Mm.

21:12.662 --> 21:13.707
What else you got?

21:13.881 --> 21:15.012
There's Northwestern.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.840
Ooh, Chicago,
home of the Bears.

21:17.014 --> 21:18.755
Mama and baby.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.583
University of Miami?

21:20.757 --> 21:23.151
Well, if the rhythm doesn't
get you, my nom-noms will.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.762
Is there anywhere
I can go next year where
she can't follow me?

21:25.936 --> 21:27.286
Well, there is this
all-male Jesuit school

21:27.460 --> 21:28.374
in northern Minnesota.

21:28.548 --> 21:29.244
Set up the interview.
