01:20.881 --> 01:22.349
Mr. Cretites?

01:25.485 --> 01:28.455
...Paul Cretites.

01:28.555 --> 01:29.456
My name
is Latimer.

01:29.556 --> 01:30.257
I've come to meet you,
Mr. Cretites.

01:32.693 --> 01:34.194
Just come this way,
Mr. Cretites.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.529
We have
a carriage waiting.

02:37.925 --> 02:40.294
During my long and
intimate acquaintance

02:40.394 --> 02:41.862
with Sherlock Holmes,

02:41.962 --> 02:44.932
I'd never heard him
refer to his relations,

02:45.065 --> 02:47.835
and hardly ever to his
own early life.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.938
Because of this reticence,
I sometimes found myself

02:51.071 --> 02:52.840
regarding him as an
isolated phenomenon

02:52.940 --> 02:54.708
as deficient
in human sympathy

02:54.808 --> 02:58.245
as he was pre-eminent
in intelligence.

02:58.378 --> 03:00.881
I'd come to believe
that he was an orphan

03:01.014 --> 03:02.783
with no
relatives living.

03:02.883 --> 03:06.119
But one day, to my
very great surprise,

03:06.220 --> 03:08.689
he began to talk to me
about his family.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.594
My singular gift
of observation introduction

03:13.694 --> 03:15.495
may have come from
my grandmother,

03:15.596 --> 03:18.432
who was a sister of Bernais,
the French artist.

03:18.532 --> 03:19.867
The art
in the blood

03:19.967 --> 03:22.436
is liable to take
the strangest forms.

03:22.569 --> 03:24.905
For example,
my brother, Mycroft.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.176
Your brother?

03:29.309 --> 03:32.112
I didn't know you
had a brother?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.947
Oh, yes.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.249
And I can
assure you,

03:35.349 --> 03:38.118
he possesses a far
greater faculty

03:38.218 --> 03:40.654
of observation and
deduction than I do.

03:40.754 --> 03:43.390
Holmes, I know that
you are a modest man

03:43.490 --> 03:44.825
Ha-ha.

03:44.925 --> 03:46.426
My dear Watson,

03:46.560 --> 03:48.362
I cannot agree
with those

03:48.462 --> 03:50.664
that rank modesty
among the virtues.

03:50.764 --> 03:52.266
To the legation,

03:52.399 --> 03:54.735
everything should be
seen exactly as it is.

03:54.835 --> 03:56.236
And to underestimate
one's self

03:56.336 --> 03:58.005
is as much a departure
from the truth

03:58.105 --> 03:59.640
as to exaggerate
one's own ability.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.275
What I have just told
you about my brother

04:01.408 --> 04:03.243
is the exact
and literal truth.

04:03.343 --> 04:06.013
Well, naturally,
I don't doubt your word.

04:06.113 --> 04:08.081
But if there is another
man in England

04:08.182 --> 04:09.816
with such
singular powers,

04:09.917 --> 04:12.219
how is it that neither
the police nor the public

04:12.319 --> 04:15.923
have ever heard of him,
let alone myself?

04:16.023 --> 04:18.825
He's very well known
in his own circles.

04:18.926 --> 04:20.627
Where then?

04:20.726 --> 04:23.163
The Diagones Club.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.599
It is the oddest
club in London,

04:25.699 --> 04:29.269
and my brother one
of the oddest men.

04:37.644 --> 04:40.747
I suppose you
wish to meet him?

04:40.848 --> 04:43.016
Well, of course I do,

04:43.116 --> 04:47.554
even if it's just to
prove that he exists.

04:50.290 --> 04:54.461
Then you shall,
this afternoon.

04:54.561 --> 04:56.964
He has come across the
most singular problem,

04:57.064 --> 04:59.299
which he thinks
might interest me.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.368
But why does
Mycroft not use

05:01.468 --> 05:03.504
his great powers
for detective work?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.606
If the art of
the detective began

05:05.706 --> 05:06.974
and ended in reasoning
from an arm chair,

05:07.074 --> 05:09.009
my brother would be the
greatest criminal agent

05:09.109 --> 05:10.611
that ever lived.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.513
What is to me a means
of livelihood

05:12.613 --> 05:15.115
is to him the merest hobby
of a dilettante.

05:15.249 --> 05:17.885
But he has no ambition
and no energy.

05:20.521 --> 05:22.155
What is his
profession, then?

05:22.256 --> 05:24.758
He has an extraordinary
faculty for figures.

05:24.892 --> 05:25.826
He audits the books

05:25.926 --> 05:27.394
for some of the
government departments.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.466
But what are
the qualifications

05:32.599 --> 05:33.901
for the Diogenes Club?

05:34.001 --> 05:35.469
Shyness and misanthropy ...

05:35.569 --> 05:37.638
my brother is one of
the founding members.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.606
It contains
the most unsociable

05:39.706 --> 05:41.542
and clubful men in time
who speak not a word

05:41.642 --> 05:45.379
and shun even
the merest glance.

05:45.479 --> 05:46.613
Now, let us enter.

05:46.713 --> 05:47.481
Yes, but ...

05:47.581 --> 05:48.515
Not a word.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.340
Holmes, have you ...

07:02.589 --> 07:03.857
We can talk
in here.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.359
Well,
thank goodness.

07:20.307 --> 07:22.643
Look at those
two men, Sherlock.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.214
What do you
make of them?

07:27.314 --> 07:28.815
The brilliant marker
of the other.

07:28.949 --> 07:29.917
Precisely.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.318
What do you make
of the other?

07:31.418 --> 07:33.153
An old soldier,
I perceive.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.655
And very
recently distraught?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.023
Served in India,
I see.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.591
And a non-commissioned
officer.

07:37.724 --> 07:38.892
Relativity,
I fancy.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.160
And a widower?

07:40.260 --> 07:42.095
With a child.

07:42.196 --> 07:46.166
Children, my dear boy,
children.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.468
Ha-ha.

07:48.569 --> 07:50.537
Mycroft Holmes.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.606
Glad to meet you,
Dr. Watson.

07:52.739 --> 07:54.708
I hear of
Sherlock everywhere

07:54.842 --> 07:56.810
since you became his...

07:56.944 --> 07:58.378
Well, thank you.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.814
For anyone who wishes
to study mankind,

08:00.914 --> 08:03.250
this is the spot.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.685
But surely you were
taking things

08:04.785 --> 08:06.587
a little too
far just now?

08:06.687 --> 08:08.222
It is not hard to say,
Watson,

08:08.355 --> 08:09.823
that a man of
that bearing,

08:09.957 --> 08:10.924
and especially
of authority

08:11.024 --> 08:12.993
and some big
skin as a soldier

08:13.093 --> 08:14.495
is more than a private,

08:14.595 --> 08:16.530
and is not long
for India.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.298
That is not long
since left the service

08:18.398 --> 08:21.435
shown by his still wearing
his ammunition boots,

08:21.568 --> 08:22.970
as they're called.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.572
He has not
the cavalry stride,

08:25.706 --> 08:27.441
but he wore his hat
on one side

08:27.541 --> 08:29.409
as is shown by
the lighter skin

08:29.510 --> 08:31.612
on one side
of his brow.

08:31.712 --> 08:34.615
His weight is against
him being a sapper.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.517
He is in
the artillery.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.852
There goes his complete
mourning shows

08:38.952 --> 08:40.587
that he has lost
someone very dear.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.322
The fact that he's doing
his own shopping

08:42.422 --> 08:44.158
looks as though
it was his wife.

08:44.258 --> 08:46.493
He's been buying things
for children,

08:46.593 --> 08:48.061
as you can see.

08:48.162 --> 08:50.898
There is a wrap, which
shows that one of them

08:50.998 --> 08:53.000
is very,
very young.

08:53.133 --> 08:57.037
And the fact that he has
a picture book under his arm

08:57.137 --> 08:58.839
shows there
is another child.

09:00.607 --> 09:04.244
Aha, Mr. Merlas.

09:04.344 --> 09:07.314
Come in, sir.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.890
These are my friends.

09:17.024 --> 09:19.092
This is Dr. Watson,

09:19.226 --> 09:22.930
and this is my younger
brother, Sherlock.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.999
You're Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

09:26.099 --> 09:28.402
I've asked Mr. Merlas
to step across.

09:28.502 --> 09:30.671
He lodges on the first
floor above me,

09:30.771 --> 09:34.107
and I thought you'd be
interested in his story.

09:34.208 --> 09:37.177
He's the reason why I
asked you to call today.

09:37.311 --> 09:38.779
Mr. Merlas,

09:38.912 --> 09:42.015
he came to me, well...

09:42.149 --> 09:46.053
But I think I shall ask
Mr. Merlas to tell

09:46.153 --> 09:48.388
his own very
remarkable experiences

09:48.489 --> 09:50.290
in his own fashion.

09:50.390 --> 09:52.025
Thank you,
Mr. Holmes.

09:55.562 --> 09:56.797
For many years,

09:56.897 --> 09:58.866
I have been the chief

09:58.999 --> 10:00.567
Greek interpreter
in London.

10:00.701 --> 10:04.104
I do not think that the
police believe my story.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.173
On my word,
I do not.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.909
Just because they have
never heard of it before,

10:09.009 --> 10:11.912
they think that such
a thing cannot be.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.782
But I know that I shall
never be easy in my mind

10:15.883 --> 10:19.686
until I know what has
become of my poor man

10:19.786 --> 10:22.589
with a sticking plastered
up on his face.

10:22.689 --> 10:25.125
Sticky...

10:25.225 --> 10:27.694
Mr. Merlas,
please sit down.

10:27.828 --> 10:30.464
Thank you, Mr. Holmes,
I prefer to stand.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.499
Watson.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.538
I am all attention.

10:41.475 --> 10:44.344
All this happened
only two days ago,

10:44.444 --> 10:46.613
on Monday night.

10:46.713 --> 10:48.482
I am Greek
by instruction.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.851
And earn my living
as an interpreter.

10:50.951 --> 10:53.587
It often happens that I'm
sent for at strange hours

10:53.687 --> 10:55.856
by foreigners who would
get into difficulties

10:55.956 --> 10:57.858
or by travelers who
would arrive late

10:57.958 --> 10:59.393
and wish
my services.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.608
Mr. Merlas?

11:47.741 --> 11:49.476
Yes?

11:49.576 --> 11:51.512
I apologize for
this intrusion,

11:51.612 --> 11:53.280
but I need
the services

11:53.380 --> 11:54.748
of an interpreter
immediately.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.884
My name
is Latimer.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.819
Immediately?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.888
I wouldn't insist unless
it were urgent,

12:00.988 --> 12:03.123
but a Greek friend of
mine has just arrived

12:03.223 --> 12:04.625
in this country
on business matter.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.293
Unfortunately,
he speaks nothing

12:06.426 --> 12:07.895
but his own tongue.

12:08.028 --> 12:09.229
I likewise so.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.797
Mr. Merlas, please.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.566
My carriage is
waiting outside.

12:17.137 --> 12:18.605
How far away?

12:18.705 --> 12:21.041
Only to Kensington.

12:43.363 --> 12:46.533
I'm sorry to have to cut off
your view, Mr. Merlas,

12:46.633 --> 12:48.669
but the fact is, I have
no intention that you

12:48.802 --> 12:51.338
should see the place
to which we are driving.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.440
It might possibly be
inconvenient to me

12:53.574 --> 12:56.276
if you were able to find
your way back again.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.646
This is very extraordinary
conduct, Mr. Latimer.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.415
You must be aware that
what you're doing

13:01.515 --> 13:03.450
is quite illegal.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.886
It is somewhat
of a liberty, no doubt,

13:05.986 --> 13:07.855
but we'll make
it up to you.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.365
For nearly two hours,
we drove,

13:18.499 --> 13:21.768
without my having the least
idea as to where I was.

13:21.869 --> 13:24.004
Did you not
notice any change

13:24.104 --> 13:25.873
of sound under
the wheels?

13:25.973 --> 13:27.875
I listened,
Mr. Holmes.

13:27.975 --> 13:31.311
Sometimes we seemed to
be on a paved causeway,

13:31.411 --> 13:33.380
sometimes on asphalt,

13:33.514 --> 13:36.083
but there was nothing
to tell me where I was.

13:36.216 --> 13:37.885
And no other sounds ...

13:37.985 --> 13:41.054
a ship's siren
or church bell?

13:41.188 --> 13:43.190
I'm sorry,
nothing like that.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.191
At what time

13:44.291 --> 13:46.126
did you finally reach
your destination?

13:46.226 --> 13:50.130
Ten minutes to 9:00,
exactly.

15:08.108 --> 15:10.744
Is this Mr. Merlas,
Harold.

15:10.844 --> 15:11.445
Yes.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.881
Well done,
Ha Ha Ha,

15:13.981 --> 15:15.949
well done.

15:16.083 --> 15:20.721
No ill will, Mr. Merlas,
I trust,

15:20.821 --> 15:23.657
but we could not
get on without you.

15:23.757 --> 15:27.728
If you deal fair with us,
you'll not regret it,

15:27.861 --> 15:31.231
but if you try any tricks,
God help you.

15:31.331 --> 15:33.300
What do you
want of me?

15:33.400 --> 15:34.902
Only to ask
a few questions

15:35.035 --> 15:37.437
of a Greek gentleman
who's visiting us,

15:37.538 --> 15:39.306
and to let us
have the answers.

15:39.406 --> 15:42.209
But, you say no more
than you are told,

15:42.309 --> 15:45.279
or it were better you had
never been born.

15:51.318 --> 15:55.155
Mr. Merlas,
pray continue.

15:55.255 --> 16:01.662
Well then, this man,
this evil man,

16:01.762 --> 16:04.832
showed me to a room
which appeared to be

16:04.965 --> 16:08.202
very curiously
furnished.

16:08.302 --> 16:13.740
But again, the only light
was afforded by a single lamp,

16:13.841 --> 16:15.809
half turned down.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.107
The slate, Harold.

16:51.345 --> 16:53.046
Are his hands loose?

17:06.126 --> 17:07.493
Take this.

17:12.499 --> 17:16.236
You will ask the
questions, Mr. Merlas,

17:16.336 --> 17:19.339
and he will write
the answers.

17:19.473 --> 17:21.775
Ask him,
first of all,

17:21.875 --> 17:26.313
whether he's prepared
to sign the papers?

18:02.749 --> 18:03.951
"Never."

18:09.456 --> 18:11.692
On no conditions?

18:26.406 --> 18:29.276
He writes,
"only if I see her married

18:29.376 --> 18:32.980
in my presence by a Greek
priest, whom I know."

18:33.080 --> 18:34.815
Ha Ha.

18:34.915 --> 18:38.552
You know what
awaits you, then?

18:50.764 --> 18:55.969
He says, "I care
nothing for myself."

18:56.069 --> 18:58.572
And so it went on,
again and again

18:58.705 --> 19:01.208
I had to ask him whether
he would give in

19:01.341 --> 19:03.143
and sign
the document.

19:03.243 --> 19:07.681
Again and again, I had
the same indignant reply.

19:07.815 --> 19:12.753
But soon,
a thought came to me.

19:12.853 --> 19:15.589
I took to adding on little
sentences of my own

19:15.689 --> 19:19.293
to each question,
innocent ones at first,

19:19.393 --> 19:21.895
to test whether either
of our companions

19:22.029 --> 19:24.198
knew anything
of the matter.

19:24.298 --> 19:26.867
And then, as I found that
they showed no sign,

19:27.000 --> 19:31.672
I played a more
dangerous game.

19:31.772 --> 19:41.381
This obstinacy
is doing you no good.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.237
He says,
"I care not."

20:11.812 --> 20:13.780
In fact, he had
also told me

20:13.881 --> 20:16.116
he was a stranger
in London.

20:16.216 --> 20:19.419
He then told me he had
been here three weeks,

20:19.520 --> 20:21.755
and was being
forcibly starved.

20:24.825 --> 20:27.528
Starved?

20:27.628 --> 20:30.697
Did you manage to
find out his name?

20:30.831 --> 20:32.332
Cretites.

20:32.466 --> 20:34.902
He was from Athens.

20:35.002 --> 20:38.539
But that was all I could
discover, unfortunately.

20:38.672 --> 20:39.339
Another five minutes,

20:39.439 --> 20:40.908
and I should
have wormed out

20:41.041 --> 20:44.411
the whole story under
their very noses.

20:44.511 --> 20:48.215
Ask him again,
Mr. Merlas.

20:48.315 --> 20:52.653
But at that instant,
the door opened,

20:52.753 --> 20:57.825
and a woman stepped
into the room.

20:57.958 --> 20:59.426
He says, "never."

20:59.526 --> 21:01.495
Well, ask him again!

21:04.097 --> 21:06.667
Harold, I could not stay
away any longer.

21:06.800 --> 21:11.138
Sophia,
Sophia, Sophia!

21:24.785 --> 21:31.925
That will do,
Mr. Merlas.

21:35.329 --> 21:37.097
As you perceive,

21:37.197 --> 21:41.468
we have taken
you into our confidence

21:41.568 --> 21:44.204
over some very
private business.

21:48.876 --> 21:53.814
Here are five sovereigns,
which will, I hope,

21:53.947 --> 21:55.649
be a sufficient fee.

21:55.749 --> 21:59.753
But remember, if you speak
to anyone about this,

21:59.887 --> 22:05.759
one human soul,
mind, well,

22:05.859 --> 22:12.399
may God have mercy
on your soul.

22:36.256 --> 22:39.226
As before, I was taken
in a closed carriage

22:39.326 --> 22:42.029
for almost
two hours.

22:42.129 --> 22:47.835
There I was abandoned, as
I was later to discover,

22:47.935 --> 22:50.204
near Wentsworth Common.

23:06.253 --> 23:08.555
I did not know
where I had been,

23:08.655 --> 23:11.358
nor whom I had spoken
with nor anything,

23:11.458 --> 23:12.993
saving what
I have told you.

23:19.266 --> 23:21.802
But I know there
is foul play going on,

23:21.935 --> 23:24.571
and I want to help
that unhappy man ...

23:24.671 --> 23:27.074
before God, I do.

24:08.882 --> 24:10.184
Mycroft.

24:12.152 --> 24:12.953
Mycroft!

24:13.053 --> 24:14.354
Huh?

24:14.454 --> 24:17.124
What steps have you
taken so far?

24:17.224 --> 24:20.594
Well, this was in all
the daily papers:

24:20.694 --> 24:23.897
"Anyone having information
as to the whereabouts

24:23.997 --> 24:26.967
of a Greek gentleman
named Paul Cretites,

24:27.067 --> 24:29.536
who cannot speak English,
will be rewarded.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.472
As ever a reward will
be paid to anyone

24:31.572 --> 24:33.540
having information
about a Greek lady,

24:33.640 --> 24:35.542
whose first
name is Sophia, "

24:35.642 --> 24:37.544
but no answer
as yet.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.112
What about the
Greek Legation?

24:39.246 --> 24:40.180
I have tried.

24:40.280 --> 24:41.281
They know nothing.

24:41.415 --> 24:43.484
The head of the Athens
police, then!

24:43.617 --> 24:49.089
Sherlock has all the
energy in the family.

24:49.223 --> 24:51.391
When you take up a case,
by all means,

24:51.492 --> 24:53.760
let me know
if you do any good!

24:53.861 --> 24:55.128
Certainly.

24:55.229 --> 24:56.997
Mr. Merlas, sir.

25:01.335 --> 25:02.803
I should be
extremely careful,

25:02.936 --> 25:05.172
if I were you,
but of course,

25:05.272 --> 25:07.241
through these
advertisements,

25:07.341 --> 25:09.076
they'll know that you've
betrayed them.

25:53.353 --> 25:54.721
Whoops.

25:54.822 --> 25:57.591
On your way.

25:57.691 --> 26:00.394
It seems to me obvious that
this Greek girl has been

26:00.494 --> 26:02.362
carried off by
the young Englishman,

26:02.462 --> 26:02.996
Harold Latimer.

26:03.130 --> 26:04.898
Carried off from where?

26:04.998 --> 26:06.266
Athens, perhaps?

26:06.366 --> 26:07.935
No, no, no ...
this Harold Latimer

26:08.068 --> 26:09.203
cannot speak a word
in Greek.

26:09.336 --> 26:11.004
The girl speaks
English fairly well,

26:11.104 --> 26:13.740
inference that she has been
in England some little time,

26:13.841 --> 26:15.342
and he has not
been in Greece.

26:25.219 --> 26:26.720
Thank you
Miss Jackson.

26:28.155 --> 26:29.857
Then, let's presume
that the girl

26:29.957 --> 26:32.259
was visiting in England
and that this Harold

26:32.359 --> 26:34.061
persuaded her to
fly with him.

26:34.161 --> 26:35.395
That is
more probable.

26:35.496 --> 26:38.332
Then the brother, that
must be the relationship,

26:38.432 --> 26:40.467
comes over from Greece
in order to intervene,

26:40.601 --> 26:41.668
they see him,

26:41.802 --> 26:45.339
use violence to force him
to sign some documents,

26:45.472 --> 26:47.541
making over the girl's
fortune to them.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.510
He's probably
the trustee.

26:49.610 --> 26:52.179
This, as we have heard,
he refuses to do.

26:52.312 --> 26:53.347
So far.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.482
But these men
will not stop now.

26:55.616 --> 26:57.684
Whatever happens, Watson,
we must find them.

26:57.818 --> 26:59.153
How can we?

26:59.253 --> 27:01.922
Well, if our
conjecture is correct,

27:02.022 --> 27:04.424
and the girl's name is ...
or was ... Sophia Cretites,

27:04.525 --> 27:06.960
we should have no
difficulty in tracing her.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.329
That must be
our main hope.

27:09.429 --> 27:11.899
The brother, of course,
is a complete stranger.

27:34.087 --> 27:35.455
Come in,
Sherlock.

27:35.556 --> 27:36.824
Come in, sir.

27:36.924 --> 27:39.293
You don't expect such energy
from me, do you, Sherlock

27:39.393 --> 27:40.727
... hmm?

27:40.828 --> 27:42.729
Now, How did you
get here?

27:42.830 --> 27:45.098
I passed you while you were
in the telegraph office.

27:45.199 --> 27:48.168
I had an answer
to my advertisement.

27:48.302 --> 27:50.270
It came within a few
minutes of your leaving.

27:50.404 --> 27:51.905
And what effect?

27:52.039 --> 27:56.844
It is written with a Jay
pen on royal cream paper

27:56.944 --> 28:00.981
by a middle-aged man
with a weak constitution.

28:01.114 --> 28:04.318
"Sir, in answer to your
advertisement of today's date,

28:04.418 --> 28:06.887
I beg to inform you
that I know the young lady

28:07.020 --> 28:08.822
in question
very well.

28:08.922 --> 28:10.891
If you should care
to call upon me,

28:11.024 --> 28:12.793
I could give you
some particulars

28:12.893 --> 28:14.895
as to her
painful history.

28:15.028 --> 28:17.898
She's at present
at Memerkle's Beckinum.

28:17.998 --> 28:21.034
Yours faithfully,
Jay Davenport."

28:21.168 --> 28:23.170
He writes from
Lower Brigestone.

28:23.303 --> 28:25.672
Do you not think we
should drive there now

28:25.772 --> 28:27.341
and learn these
particulars?

28:27.474 --> 28:28.942
My dear Mycroft.

28:29.076 --> 28:31.078
Her brother's life
is more important

28:31.211 --> 28:32.746
than the sister's story.

28:32.880 --> 28:34.581
But we should call
at Scotland Yard

28:34.681 --> 28:35.315
for Inspector Gregson

28:35.449 --> 28:37.885
and then go straight
out to Beckinum,

28:37.985 --> 28:41.054
where we know that a man
is being done to death,

28:41.188 --> 28:42.956
Every hour maybe vital.

28:43.056 --> 28:45.893
Better pick up
Mr. Merlas on the way?

28:45.993 --> 28:47.494
Why?

28:47.628 --> 28:50.998
Because we may need
a Greek interpreter.

28:51.098 --> 28:53.400
Excellent, Watson.

28:53.500 --> 28:56.703
I should say from
what we have heard,

28:56.804 --> 28:58.806
that we are
dealing with

28:58.939 --> 29:00.474
a particularly
dangerous guy.

29:16.323 --> 29:17.724
Mr. Merlas?

29:17.825 --> 29:18.759
Yes.

29:18.859 --> 29:21.295
There's a gentleman
downstairs to see you, sir.

29:21.395 --> 29:22.796
What gentleman?

29:22.896 --> 29:25.599
Well, he said he met you
today at the Diogenes Club.

29:30.504 --> 29:33.240
Mr. Holmes!
Thank you!

29:44.117 --> 29:47.488
Good evening,
Mr. Merlas.

30:35.569 --> 30:37.104
Good evening,
Mrs.Sterd,

30:37.237 --> 30:40.107
Would you tell Mr. Merlas
I need to see him urgently.

30:40.207 --> 30:42.176
Well, Mr. Merlas
is not here, sir.

30:42.276 --> 30:44.678
A gentleman just called
for him, and he left.

30:44.778 --> 30:46.079
Can you tell
me where?

30:46.180 --> 30:47.447
Oh, I don't know,
sir.

30:47.548 --> 30:48.515
All I know is,

30:48.649 --> 30:50.617
he drove off with a
gentleman in a carriage.

30:50.751 --> 30:52.052
Did the gentleman
give a name?

30:52.152 --> 30:53.153
No, sir.

30:53.287 --> 30:55.656
He wasn't a tall,
handsome, dark, young man?

30:55.756 --> 30:56.757
Oh, no, sir.

30:56.890 --> 30:59.293
He was a little
gentleman, with glasses,

30:59.393 --> 31:02.763
thin in the face, but very
pleasant in his ways.

31:02.863 --> 31:05.532
He was laughing all the
time he was talking.

31:05.632 --> 31:06.533
Thank you.

31:09.770 --> 31:12.072
Scotland Yard,
and hurry!

31:24.218 --> 31:26.119
It cannot be done
without a warrant!

31:26.220 --> 31:29.656
We are not disputing
that, Inspector.

31:29.790 --> 31:31.758
Even if they
are criminals,

31:31.859 --> 31:34.361
it is a private house
and the law demands ...

31:34.495 --> 31:37.664
The law demands that
we act quickly.

31:37.764 --> 31:39.600
Can you not find
a Magistrate

31:39.700 --> 31:41.535
to sign this
warrant for us?

31:41.635 --> 31:42.836
A this hour?

31:47.141 --> 31:49.209
At this very minute

31:49.343 --> 31:52.012
our kidnapping
could become murder.

31:52.112 --> 31:55.449
I can but try.

31:55.549 --> 31:56.950
Please do.

32:10.197 --> 32:15.702
Tell him,
I have ceased being reasonable.

32:15.836 --> 32:19.373
If he does not sign
the papers now,

32:19.506 --> 32:22.409
I will kill him.

32:22.509 --> 32:27.080
Tell him I have
no more patience.

32:41.028 --> 32:41.995
No.

32:44.465 --> 32:45.799
No.

32:50.370 --> 32:51.505
No.

32:53.173 --> 32:55.075
No.

32:55.909 --> 32:57.444
Please, Inspector ...

32:57.578 --> 32:59.346
will you not come
without a warrant?

32:59.446 --> 33:00.948
I am sorry, gentlemen ...

33:01.081 --> 33:03.050
We have wasted
nearly an hour.

33:03.150 --> 33:06.653
The law cannot
be hurried, Mr. Holmes.

33:06.787 --> 33:12.259
The life of Mr. Merlas
is in your hands, Inspector.

33:19.066 --> 33:23.003
Tell him ... hmm ...
tell him if I kill him ...

33:24.905 --> 33:26.740
... I have no use anymore ...

33:28.041 --> 33:31.278
... for his sister,
and she will die, also.

33:31.378 --> 33:32.212
But you wouldn't ...

33:32.312 --> 33:33.447
TELL HIM!

34:01.642 --> 34:03.577
Here it is, gentlemen ...
it's signed.

34:03.677 --> 34:05.012
Now get someone
to drive us

34:05.112 --> 34:05.979
to London Bridge
Station.

34:06.079 --> 34:08.047
I pray we're
not too late!

34:40.514 --> 34:43.016
A carriage heavily
loaded with luggage

34:43.150 --> 34:45.552
has passed that within
the last half-hour.

34:45.652 --> 34:47.221
Wait for us here.

35:15.983 --> 35:19.553
The nest is empty
and the birds are flown.

35:50.384 --> 35:52.352
It's sulfur!

35:52.486 --> 35:55.789
Mycroft, get the lamp!

35:55.889 --> 35:58.091
Come, help me
with the bodies!

35:58.192 --> 35:58.959
Right!

36:14.708 --> 36:15.943
Quick!

36:18.579 --> 36:20.747
The poor wretch
must be Paul Cretites.

36:20.881 --> 36:23.684
No more, I'm afraid.
His life is over.

36:23.784 --> 36:26.320
We should have been
here sooner, Inspector!

36:26.453 --> 36:29.156
He must have been dead
about four hours.

36:29.256 --> 36:31.625
The gas made of sulfur,

36:31.725 --> 36:33.127
am I not right,
Dr. Watson?

36:33.227 --> 36:35.095
Beaten to death.

36:37.397 --> 36:39.133
But Mr. Merlas
still lives.

36:39.233 --> 36:41.668
Quick! Let's get him out
of here as fast as possible!

36:41.768 --> 36:43.036
Inspector, brandy!

36:43.137 --> 36:46.006
Relax, Mr. Merlas,
you're in safe hands.

36:46.106 --> 36:47.574
Get the ropes off him.

37:10.697 --> 37:12.266
From a brief look
at her room,

37:12.399 --> 37:13.500
the lady left
in haste,

37:13.634 --> 37:15.502
but without
a struggle.

37:15.602 --> 37:21.275
That man Latimer must still
have some power over her.

37:21.375 --> 37:24.011
One wonders,

37:24.144 --> 37:27.581
with how much remorse
she abandoned her brother

37:27.681 --> 37:29.616
for Harold Latimer?

37:29.716 --> 37:32.653
You still retain your
low opinion of women?

37:32.753 --> 37:37.057
In this instance,
I cannot maybe justify.

37:37.157 --> 37:44.498
Holmes, they appear to have
consulted a Bradshaw.

37:47.034 --> 37:49.002
Look at this page.

37:53.307 --> 37:55.275
The boat train.

37:55.409 --> 37:57.711
The murderers
won't get far.

37:57.811 --> 38:00.080
Have man at every port
in England, if need be.

38:00.180 --> 38:03.417
The boat train makes one stop
between London and Dover.

38:03.517 --> 38:09.723
At Hurn Hill in
23 minutes, precisely.

38:09.823 --> 38:10.724
Exactly.

38:10.824 --> 38:12.793
Stay with your chief
witness, Inspector.

38:12.926 --> 38:15.062
You may need
a statement from him.

38:15.195 --> 38:16.997
And he will
need your help.

38:17.097 --> 38:20.434
A little brandy, and ammonia
at frequent intervals.

38:40.354 --> 38:44.625
Mycroft, I'm not built
for running so hard!

39:20.994 --> 39:23.297
Tickets, please!

39:23.397 --> 39:26.467
Will you kindly have your
tickets ready, please?

39:29.970 --> 39:32.072
My name
is Sherlock Holmes.

39:32.206 --> 39:34.374
Mr. Sherlock Holmes?

39:34.508 --> 39:36.376
Well, I've read about
your cases, sir.

39:36.477 --> 39:37.511
Are we the
last passengers

39:37.644 --> 39:38.979
from whom you have
collected tickets?

39:39.079 --> 39:40.614
Indeed, sir.

39:40.747 --> 39:41.615
I always work at the
engine, start there,

39:41.715 --> 39:43.250
and work my way back
to the garden.

39:43.383 --> 39:44.518
Then you
can help me.

39:44.651 --> 39:46.987
There are three passengers,
two men and a woman,

39:47.087 --> 39:48.422
traveling together.

39:48.522 --> 39:50.257
They may not appear
to be companions,

39:50.357 --> 39:52.359
but they will be in
a compartment alone.

39:52.493 --> 39:55.028
The elder man wears
thick-lensed glasses,

39:55.162 --> 39:56.430
and the younger one
is quite handsome.

39:56.530 --> 39:58.065
They will have a great deal
of luggage marked

39:58.198 --> 39:59.399
for the Continent.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.135
Have you seen
such a party?

40:01.268 --> 40:03.270
Yes, indeed, I can
help you, Mr. Holmes.

40:03.403 --> 40:04.771
I never
doubted it.

40:04.872 --> 40:05.906
There are two parties

40:06.039 --> 40:07.741
who fit that description,
Mr. Holmes.

40:07.841 --> 40:08.842
Two?

40:08.976 --> 40:10.043
Ticket, please.

40:13.614 --> 40:15.916
In Compartment B4 ...

40:16.016 --> 40:17.050
B4.

40:17.184 --> 40:18.519
... and D8.

40:18.619 --> 40:20.087
Thank you,
Inspector.

40:20.220 --> 40:22.656
How do you know which
two are the murderers?

40:22.756 --> 40:26.193
It couldn't be simpler.
No, don't wake him.

40:26.326 --> 40:29.229
There's danger enough
for the two of us.

40:51.485 --> 40:53.954
A left-handed printer
from Detford.

40:54.087 --> 40:56.623
His older brother
drinks too much

40:56.757 --> 40:59.259
and is pained
by his liver.

40:59.393 --> 41:00.961
Can't harm mine then.

41:01.094 --> 41:02.095
Whatever.

41:11.538 --> 41:12.806
And the girl?

41:12.906 --> 41:14.441
She knows
neither of them,

41:14.575 --> 41:15.642
she's a machinist
from Bradford

41:15.776 --> 41:16.877
who's going on
a Holiday

41:17.010 --> 41:18.579
to find romance.

41:18.712 --> 41:20.247
Which means,
undoubtedly,

41:20.380 --> 41:22.716
the murderers aren't
in Compartment B4.

41:59.620 --> 42:02.322
Thank you,
Miss Cretites.

42:02.422 --> 42:08.428
Do sit still, Mr. Latimer.
Do come in, Watson.

42:20.407 --> 42:22.709
Who the hell are you?

42:22.810 --> 42:24.812
The third member
of the party is absent,

42:24.945 --> 42:27.247
but I'm sure he
will return.

42:57.678 --> 42:59.246
Miss Cretites, may I ask

42:59.379 --> 43:01.615
if you are this man's
prisoner or companion?

43:01.715 --> 43:03.350
Don't say anything.

43:03.484 --> 43:06.186
They have no right to ask
you anything at all.

43:06.286 --> 43:08.655
If they were the police,
they would have said so.

43:08.755 --> 43:10.757
Why the police,
Mr. Latimer?

43:10.891 --> 43:13.227
Were you expecting
to meet them?

43:13.327 --> 43:15.596
Look, I don't
know who you are,

43:15.696 --> 43:18.465
nor do I know how
you know my name,

43:18.565 --> 43:20.334
but I'm traveling
with my fiancèe

43:20.434 --> 43:22.803
to the Continent
to get married.

43:22.903 --> 43:24.404
So, would you please
leave us alone?

43:24.538 --> 43:26.874
Otherwise, I shall be
obliged to call a guard.

43:26.974 --> 43:28.876
Please do.

43:28.976 --> 43:29.943
I'm sure Dr. Watson
would do it for you.

43:33.247 --> 43:36.283
Ah, I see
you know who I am?

43:36.416 --> 43:39.486
Then may I be
permitted to ask

43:39.620 --> 43:41.755
your fiancèe
the question again?

43:41.889 --> 43:44.725
It's true what he said.

43:44.825 --> 43:46.660
We are going
to be married?

43:46.760 --> 43:48.128
Where?

43:48.228 --> 43:49.897
In Athens.

43:50.030 --> 43:51.265
I fear not.

43:51.365 --> 43:52.800
And who is going
to stop us?

43:52.900 --> 43:54.368
If not the police,
then I will.

43:54.501 --> 43:56.537
Miss Cretites, do you
seriously want me to believe

43:56.670 --> 44:00.140
that you are leaving
England willingly?

44:00.274 --> 44:01.442
Yes.

44:01.575 --> 44:04.478
To marry the man who has
just murdered your brother?

44:04.578 --> 44:06.046
That's not true.

44:06.180 --> 44:08.549
No! Murdered?

44:08.649 --> 44:10.217
It isn't true, is it?

44:10.350 --> 44:12.519
He's going to meet us in
Greece as soon as he's well.

44:12.653 --> 44:14.354
That's what
you said to me.

44:14.455 --> 44:16.590
And he will Sophia,
he will.

44:16.723 --> 44:18.959
Your brother is dead,
Miss Cretites.

44:19.059 --> 44:20.727
Don't listen
to him.

44:20.861 --> 44:23.330
I found his body myself
in the house in Beckinum.

44:26.333 --> 44:27.601
He had been murdered.

44:27.701 --> 44:29.203
tortured to death.

44:29.336 --> 44:31.738
No, it can't be.

44:31.839 --> 44:34.141
Harold, tell me
what's happened!

44:34.241 --> 44:35.976
As for you,
Mr. Latimer,

44:36.076 --> 44:41.014
Mr. Merlas is alive as
a witness to see you hanged.

45:00.400 --> 45:03.470
Help me, Sophia, help me!

45:03.604 --> 45:09.943
Help me! Help me!

45:44.211 --> 45:47.714
...went very well,
very well indeed.

45:47.848 --> 45:50.617
I have friends
dead.

45:50.717 --> 45:54.388
Yes, but I need
not elaborate,

45:54.521 --> 45:57.891
as I see you are a man of
the world, sir?

45:57.991 --> 45:59.626
On the contrary ...

45:59.760 --> 46:02.563
I've never left England
in my life.

46:02.663 --> 46:04.064
Haven't you?

46:04.164 --> 46:05.566
No.

46:05.666 --> 46:08.702
Then sir, if you must
choose one country,

46:08.836 --> 46:11.205
it must be Greece ...

46:11.305 --> 46:14.675
the land of Gods,
olives and intrigue.

46:17.277 --> 46:20.114
It is my destination,
Greece.

46:20.214 --> 46:22.549
Do you speak Greek, sir?

46:22.649 --> 46:26.987
No, but one can always
find a good interpreter.

46:29.790 --> 46:31.758
Thank you.

46:31.892 --> 46:34.361
An excellent meal.

46:34.495 --> 46:36.797
well, good bye, sir.

46:36.897 --> 46:39.032
It was a pleasure
meeting you.

46:39.166 --> 46:40.434
Well, good bye.

46:40.534 --> 46:43.070
It was an interesting
conversation.

46:43.837 --> 46:46.640
I do apologize.

46:49.276 --> 46:52.913
Sometimes,
I forget my size.

46:58.852 --> 47:00.454
Goodbye again.

47:15.035 --> 47:17.504
Is it true about Paul?

47:17.604 --> 47:19.373
I'm afraid so.

47:23.210 --> 47:26.747
I hated Harold Latimer.

47:26.880 --> 47:30.684
I hated him,
and I loved him.

47:30.784 --> 47:34.321
I would have done
anything he said.

47:34.455 --> 47:38.192
I would have gone
anywhere with him.

47:38.292 --> 47:41.195
Even though he murdered
your brother?

47:41.295 --> 47:46.233
Yes, even then.

47:50.938 --> 47:52.773
Mr.Cana,

47:52.873 --> 47:54.675
we were expecting you.

48:00.447 --> 48:04.885
I believe this is
your revolver, sir?

48:33.747 --> 48:35.249
Well, brother of mine ...

48:35.382 --> 48:37.351
we seem to be heading
down the path of crime.

48:37.484 --> 48:39.286
The only path
I intend to take

48:39.386 --> 48:41.455
is the door to
the Diogenes Club,

48:41.588 --> 48:43.090
which I will
close behind me.

48:50.164 --> 48:51.799
What will
become of her?

48:51.932 --> 48:54.034
After questioning,
nothing.

48:54.168 --> 48:56.537
There's not a crime
to her cold heart,

48:56.637 --> 48:58.972
and not a single shred
of compassion.
