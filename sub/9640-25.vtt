WEBVTT

00:04.133 --> 00:06.467
Hey.
What are you doing?

00:06.467 --> 00:08.000
Oh, uh,
there's nothing good on TV,

00:08.000 --> 00:09.767
so I'm going to
watch Alex do homework.

00:09.767 --> 00:12.800
That's a reality show
I've never seen an episode of.

00:14.700 --> 00:18.200
Daddy, see?
Too many distractions.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.667
It's really Justin's fault that
I've fallen behind in science.

00:21.667 --> 00:23.500
Really? I thought
it had something to do

00:23.500 --> 00:25.600
with the 14 missing assignments.
[gasping]

00:27.000 --> 00:29.734
Fourteen?
I thought it was ten.

00:29.734 --> 00:33.400
[stammering] I told you that
four weeks ago.

00:33.400 --> 00:36.600
[sighing] This is why you
aren't doing anything over
school break,

00:36.600 --> 00:38.567
except take that
science class.

00:38.567 --> 00:41.567
It's ironic that the person
who likes school the least

00:41.567 --> 00:43.200
has to do it the most.

00:44.934 --> 00:47.800
[chuckling]
Life is funny like that.

00:50.700 --> 00:53.233
- Here, Justin.
This one's for you.
- Oooh.

00:53.233 --> 00:56.200
This is from that
essay contest I entered.

00:58.033 --> 01:01.500
"Winner..." Winner, winner!
I won! I won the contest!

01:01.500 --> 01:04.934
I won a trip to the S.S. Tipton
Teen Cruise to Hawaii.

01:04.934 --> 01:07.667
- [gasping]
- [both yelling] We're going
on a cruise!

01:08.900 --> 01:13.967
Teen cruise.
Family members 18 and under.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.900
[both yelling]
We're going on a cruise!

01:17.900 --> 01:19.800
Ah! Hold on there,
little girl.

01:19.800 --> 01:22.100
You're not going anywhere
but that science class.

01:22.100 --> 01:24.734
That's what you get
for missing ten assignments.

01:24.734 --> 01:27.400
- It's up to 14 now.
- What?

01:27.400 --> 01:30.000
Clearly, we need
to check every week.

01:31.100 --> 01:33.100
Alex, you're gonna come
to the ship with us

01:33.100 --> 01:34.667
and drop off your brothers.

01:34.667 --> 01:37.400
And maybe seeing all the fun
they're about to have

01:37.400 --> 01:39.467
will make you feel
really bad about yourself.

01:41.033 --> 01:43.867
- Is that good parenting?
- I think it is.

01:43.867 --> 01:45.200
All right.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.567
Oh, my gosh.
Look...

01:47.567 --> 01:51.033
It says here I get a
photo op with London Tipton.

01:51.033 --> 01:53.600
[sighing]
She's beautiful and rich.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.300
And famous for doing
absolutely nothing.

01:57.300 --> 02:00.367
- Aren't you kinda
known for doing nothing?
- [scoffing]

02:00.367 --> 02:01.700
You think I'm doing nothing,

02:01.700 --> 02:04.367
but really I'm planning
something against you.

02:04.367 --> 02:07.000
- That's my popcorn. Come on!
- No.

03:05.934 --> 03:07.000
Hey, Mr. Moseby.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.367
"Teen Cruise to Hawaii?"
Awesome, huh?

03:09.367 --> 03:12.033
If I paint over the word "teen,"
will they go away?

03:14.500 --> 03:16.800
Come on, Mr. Moseby.
It can't be that bad.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.734
I signed up for the class
you're teaching.

03:18.734 --> 03:22.100
Oh, good. I look forward
to matching minds with you.

03:22.100 --> 03:24.300
- Shouldn't be half bad.
- Oh, really?

03:24.300 --> 03:29.567
- You plus you equals all bad.
- OK, zzzt!

03:31.300 --> 03:32.600
[elevator dings]

03:37.400 --> 03:38.900
Wow.

03:40.233 --> 03:42.033
We're just saying
goodbye to the boys.

03:42.033 --> 03:44.800
- You don't have to wear
a life vest.
- Yes, I do.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.600
We're on water. And if people
were meant to be on water,

03:47.600 --> 03:51.867
we'd be born with these things.

03:51.867 --> 03:54.500
But you have all those swimming
medals from high school.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.600
Honey, why do you think
I was so fast?

03:56.600 --> 03:58.900
I couldn't wait
to get out of the water.

03:58.900 --> 04:00.300
Ah.

04:03.200 --> 04:05.233
Thank you.

04:05.233 --> 04:09.100
Dude, check it out!
There's a marine paleontology
exhibit on board.

04:09.100 --> 04:11.700
They must have known
I was coming.

04:12.767 --> 04:14.300
Was I supposed
to keep an eye on Alex,

04:14.300 --> 04:16.800
- and make sure
she didn't sneak away?
- Yes.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.600
When exactly
does that job start?

04:21.500 --> 04:24.600
- Russos? The Russo party.
- Right here. Yes.

04:24.600 --> 04:26.100
Ah, the contest winners.

04:26.100 --> 04:29.200
Welcome to the S.S. Tipton
Teen Cruise to Hawaii.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.900
- [groaning] You know,
the ship's name is "Tipton,"
- Mm-hm.

04:32.900 --> 04:37.767
which has the word "tip" in it.
Which makes me really nervous.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.500
It also has the word
"ton" in it.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.967
As in this ship weighs
87,000 tons.

04:44.967 --> 04:48.100
Oh, my gosh.
How does this thing float?

04:49.834 --> 04:51.233
Magic.

04:54.100 --> 04:55.133
I'm kidding.

04:56.800 --> 04:59.100
There's no such thing
as magic!

05:02.133 --> 05:05.700
The letter said I would get
a photo op with London Tipton.

05:05.700 --> 05:08.600
Justin, don't be disappointed
if she won't talk to you.

05:08.600 --> 05:14.100
Maybe there will be a cardboard
cut-out of her you can meet.

05:14.100 --> 05:17.500
Now, let me tell you about
the wonderful amenities
we have on board:

05:17.500 --> 05:21.500
We have an arcade and a hot tub,
a buffet, a basketball court.

05:21.500 --> 05:24.133
Oooh! And a state-of-the-art
marine biology lab,

05:24.133 --> 05:26.867
- where I'll be teaching class.
- There's a school on board?

05:26.867 --> 05:29.400
- Yes.
- Don't tell Alex.

05:29.400 --> 05:33.000
She'll wear us down until
we let her take her class here.

05:33.000 --> 05:35.600
Theresa, we must be strong.

05:35.600 --> 05:39.233
87,000 tons.

05:40.734 --> 05:43.967
Now, I'll take the teens
to their contest-winning cabin.

05:43.967 --> 05:46.800
Is it close to, uh,
London Tipton's room?

05:46.800 --> 05:51.100
No, but it's close to where
we store the cardboard cut-outs
of her. [cackling]

05:53.967 --> 05:55.967
Bye!

05:55.967 --> 05:58.233
OK. Let's find Alex
and get out of here.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.800
Right. Before she figures
out there's a school on board.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.233
- [elevator dings]
- Did you guys know
there's a school on board?

06:04.233 --> 06:08.800
- And, there's a 24-hour
pizza bar.
- There's a pizza bar?

06:08.800 --> 06:12.500
Don't get distracted by the
pizza. That's part of her plan.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.667
But pizza's the second
most distracting food,

06:14.667 --> 06:16.867
after ice cream.

06:16.867 --> 06:19.000
I wonder if they
have ice cream on board.

06:19.967 --> 06:21.867
OK, I've lost you.

06:21.867 --> 06:25.734
Alex, even if we said yes,
you're not even packed.

06:25.734 --> 06:29.233
So if I'm packed, I'm good?

06:29.233 --> 06:30.800
"Bags from home meet me here,

06:30.800 --> 06:33.233
take them there
and bring them near."

06:34.567 --> 06:36.800
You packed your bags?

06:36.800 --> 06:38.500
How did you know
you'd be going?

06:38.500 --> 06:41.700
I find that if you keep acting
like something you want
is gonna happen,

06:41.700 --> 06:43.400
a lot of times it does.

06:43.400 --> 06:47.200
Listen, if I let you do this,
you have to promise to stay
in that class.

06:47.200 --> 06:50.800
And find out if there's
any ice cream in there.

06:50.800 --> 06:53.800
Dad, I promise to stay in class.
What else am I going to do?

06:53.800 --> 06:57.300
Well... Ah! I'm not gonna
give you any ideas.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.500
[ship horn blowing]

06:59.500 --> 07:01.033
Oh, my gosh.
We're sinking.

07:01.033 --> 07:04.000
Let's go!
[yelling] Let's go!

07:11.200 --> 07:14.200
[singing] Ah-ha!

07:16.734 --> 07:19.567
This is the S.S. Tipton
Teen Cruise's best cabin.

07:21.567 --> 07:24.200
- This is the ship's infirmary.
- [Moseby] Hm...

07:24.200 --> 07:26.700
Oh, uh, I don't know
what "infirmary" means,

07:26.700 --> 07:29.900
but I'm pretty sure this
is where they treat
the sick people.

07:31.400 --> 07:33.300
True, we were over-booked,

07:33.300 --> 07:36.367
- but it is one of our most
sanitary cabins.
- [Max] Ah.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.734
At least it was.

07:39.734 --> 07:41.200
Enjoy.

07:43.033 --> 07:44.600
[door closing]

07:44.600 --> 07:46.967
Justin, look.
Check it out.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.600
It's one of those arm clocks.

07:48.600 --> 07:50.200
I'm going to go
put it on people

07:50.200 --> 07:52.133
and tell them what time
it is inside their bodies.

07:53.367 --> 07:55.767
Bon jour, brothers!
Surprised to see me?

07:55.767 --> 07:58.800
[scoffing] No. Surprised that
you know two words of French.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.500
Mom and Dad said as long as I
take my science class on board,
I can stay.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.667
Mom and Dad also think I got no
shot at meeting London Tipton.

08:05.667 --> 08:07.033
And they're probably right.

08:07.033 --> 08:08.834
What would London Tipton
want to do

08:08.834 --> 08:12.100
with someone who could only
get on this ship by entering
an essay contest?

08:12.100 --> 08:15.033
The photo op will probably be,
"Hello, I wrote an essay."

08:15.033 --> 08:17.500
[high-pitched] "Oh.
Hello, I'm beautiful and rich."

08:17.500 --> 08:21.600
Click! "Wait, my eyes were
closed! Can we... you, busy."

08:24.600 --> 08:28.400
If you want to talk to London
Tipton, just do what I do.

08:28.400 --> 08:30.500
Keep acting like something
you want's gonna happen.

08:30.500 --> 08:34.700
And a lot of times it just does.
I'm on the cruise, right?

08:36.200 --> 08:37.800
Yeah, you may
be on to something.

08:37.800 --> 08:39.867
Well, get out of here.
I'm about to do something

08:39.867 --> 08:41.100
you don't
wanna know about.

08:41.100 --> 08:42.834
- Does it involve me?
- No.

08:42.834 --> 08:44.567
All right.

08:58.467 --> 09:00.400
Hey, I was thinking
while I was in there,

09:00.400 --> 09:02.400
these tights could be a hat.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.767
Why not? See how much fun
this cruise is?

09:05.767 --> 09:09.467
Speaking of fun, I signed you up
for a really cool marine biology
course.

09:09.467 --> 09:12.233
Marine biology?
That doesn't sound like fun.

09:12.233 --> 09:16.233
What? You love marine biology.
Remember that whale-watching
trip?

09:16.233 --> 09:21.600
- The one when I got seasick?
- That wasn't seasick.
That was excited-sick.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.767
I do throw up
when I get excited.

09:24.767 --> 09:29.600
Well, get ready to vomit,
because you're going to
marine biology class.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.200
- Thanks, Alex.
- Oh, one more thing though.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.400
You're going to be
Alex Russo when you go.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.367
Well, who are you
gonna be?

09:36.367 --> 09:40.400
I'm gonna be the girl
having as much fun as she can,
as fast as she can

09:40.400 --> 09:42.667
until she gets caught.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.500
Someone get this thing off me!

09:45.500 --> 09:47.767
It keeps getting tighter!

09:52.133 --> 09:53.967
[air hissing]

09:53.967 --> 09:56.567
[sighing] Ah, thanks.

09:56.567 --> 09:59.500
So, I hear you're randomly
taking people's blood pressure.

09:59.500 --> 10:04.200
I'm Zack. I'm kind of the one
on the ship who does weird
and hilarious stuff.

10:04.200 --> 10:08.133
Well, good for you. I'm the one
who does incredibly cool,
serious stuff

10:08.133 --> 10:11.800
that people laugh at
for no reason.

10:11.800 --> 10:15.233
[chuckling] That sounds
like a challenge.

10:15.233 --> 10:16.934
Well, that's where
you're wrong.

10:16.934 --> 10:19.667
It sounds to me like the whole
time you've been talking,

10:19.667 --> 10:23.467
I've been trying to figure out
what you meant by
"blood pressure."

10:24.867 --> 10:28.600
Oh, it's on. You and me.
Tonight. Easy Squeezy.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.934
We're drinking super-sized
"everything slushies."

10:30.934 --> 10:34.100
They give you a slush rush.
See if you can handle it.

10:34.100 --> 10:35.367
You're on.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.900
[silent mouthing]

10:57.500 --> 11:00.467
Oh! Excuse me, do you
work in this jewelry store?

11:00.467 --> 11:02.667
Can I see that
in a princess setting?

11:02.667 --> 11:04.734
- Jewelry store?
- Hm-hm.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.133
Uh... I don't work here.

11:08.133 --> 11:12.000
Uh, I was just wondering, uh...

11:12.000 --> 11:15.500
- Where would you like to go
on our second date?
- [chuckling]

11:15.500 --> 11:18.233
Well, second dates for me
are taking my private jet

11:18.233 --> 11:20.200
to one of my four castles
for fried chicken,

11:20.200 --> 11:23.600
or taking one of my helicopters
to one of my yachts for
fried chicken.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.967
- I love fried chicken.
- [both giggling]

11:25.967 --> 11:30.934
Wait a minute. We didn't go out
on a first date. Who are you?

11:30.934 --> 11:33.600
Uh, no, I, uh...

11:33.600 --> 11:38.567
- I'm... the paleontologist
in charge of this exhibit.
- [gasps]

11:38.567 --> 11:43.100
- Yep. Dr. uh... Fossil.
- [gasps]

11:44.367 --> 11:47.600
- I'm a doctor.
- Oooh, I like doctors.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.867
So, Dr. Fossil, if we were
going on a second date,

11:50.867 --> 11:53.900
and I'm not saying we are,
because I think the number
"second"

11:53.900 --> 11:55.367
comes after the number "first,"

11:55.367 --> 11:58.100
but then, I was never really
good with lower case numbers,

11:58.100 --> 11:59.367
where would you take me?

12:00.567 --> 12:02.900
I'd take you to the best
restaurant on this ship.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.800
[gasps]
The Balcony of the Neptune Room?

12:05.800 --> 12:10.867
- That.
- Tonight. Eight. I'll meet you
there, Dr. Fossil.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.200
The doctor is in.

12:22.834 --> 12:27.233
- Hi. I'm Alex Russo.
- I'm Cody Martin.

12:27.233 --> 12:29.667
I see you like to get to class
before the teacher, too.

12:29.667 --> 12:33.734
I do. And I'm OK with
sitting up front, now that
my self-confidence is up.

12:33.734 --> 12:37.900
People used to make fun of me
behind my back, but now I'm OK
with it.

12:37.900 --> 12:42.133
They also find it threatening
if you turn around and say,
"I heard that."

12:42.133 --> 12:45.300
Nice to meet you, Alex Russo.
I'm going to remember you.

12:45.300 --> 12:46.767
Ah, you don't have to.

12:51.500 --> 12:55.867
Ah! I need one more for
the tug of war. Hm? Anyone?

12:57.133 --> 12:58.900
Chance to humiliate
some boys?

12:58.900 --> 12:59.967
Sure, why not!

13:01.500 --> 13:04.700
And the winner gets two tickets
to the Hannah Montana concert.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.233
[gasping] Oh my gosh,
I love Hannah Montana.

13:07.233 --> 13:10.500
Well, good for you,
girl I don't know.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.834
I'm Bailey.
What's your name?

13:13.834 --> 13:17.400
I'm... girl you don't know.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.100
And, go!

13:22.767 --> 13:25.233
- We're slipping.
We're slipping!
- Spit on the floor!

13:25.233 --> 13:27.700
- [hocking, spitting noises]
- Rub your shoes in it.

13:29.667 --> 13:31.834
Oh, it's working!
Oh, I get it.

13:31.834 --> 13:34.834
- It gets the dust off your
shoes to give traction...
- Less talk, more pull!

13:34.834 --> 13:35.900
Sorry!

13:43.367 --> 13:46.000
- Ha!
- [both] Powned!

13:46.000 --> 13:48.800
- What! Eat it.
- Yeah!

13:48.800 --> 13:53.300
- And the winner is
Bailey and...
- Girl you don't know.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.800
[squeaking] We won!
We're going to Hannah Montana!

13:57.800 --> 14:00.834
[chuckling] Massive splash,
and I got nothing.

14:02.400 --> 14:05.867
Now, I will need your name so I
can put it on the winners board

14:05.867 --> 14:09.033
- with your picture for everyone
to see.
- No, no, no. No names.

14:09.033 --> 14:12.834
No board. We didn't win.
We cheated by spitting
on the floor.

14:12.834 --> 14:17.600
- She told me to, Mr. Moseby.
- After all we've been through?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.300
- Can I still go to
Hannah Montana?
- Oh!

14:21.300 --> 14:23.300
Not unless you win
the scavenger hunt.

14:23.300 --> 14:26.700
I'm gonna go look for an
egg-beater. There's always
an egg-beater.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.900
I will need your name
for the cheaters roster.

14:30.900 --> 14:33.500
- My name...
- Hm-hm.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.500
...is...

14:35.500 --> 14:40.000
Ashley... Olsen.

14:41.934 --> 14:46.600
Ashley Olsen, you are the most
honest cheater I've ever met.

14:48.300 --> 14:50.000
[camera clicking]

14:50.000 --> 14:54.400
Ashley Olsen. I can probably
remember that. Ashley... Oh, no.

14:54.400 --> 14:55.967
Ah, well.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.400
And so I had to go ahead
and operate on him,

15:05.400 --> 15:09.367
even though I only had a Swiss
army knife and a bowling ball.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.834
[gasping] Oh, my gosh.

15:11.834 --> 15:13.033
That is so amazing.

15:13.033 --> 15:16.133
You did all that and
you're a teenage doctor?

15:16.133 --> 15:20.967
- Nope. I did all that because
I'm a teenage doctor.
- [gasps]

15:22.700 --> 15:25.967
You know, there are a lot of
people who make up all kinds
of stories

15:25.967 --> 15:29.800
- just to get close to me.
- Really?

15:29.800 --> 15:33.300
Yeah, people lie to me
all the time.

15:33.300 --> 15:38.133
- But, you would never lie
to me, would you, Dr. Fossil?
- Oh, uh, no.

15:41.567 --> 15:44.367
- London, there's something
I have to tell you.
- Me, too.

15:44.367 --> 15:48.500
Look, I'm just so glad I finally
met someone who can be real
around me.

15:48.500 --> 15:52.000
- Now, what were you going
to say?
- Nothing.

15:52.000 --> 15:55.567
Just that I was gonna remind you
that I'm a teenage doctor and I
really like you.

15:55.567 --> 16:00.100
- [both chuckling]
- Well, I really like you, too.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.934
- [phone ringing]
- Oooh. Text!

16:03.467 --> 16:06.100
- Oh, what a pain. I have to go.
- What?

16:06.100 --> 16:08.867
I really wanna finish
this date, but I can't.

16:08.867 --> 16:11.200
I have to go to the main deck
to greet some poor family

16:11.200 --> 16:14.667
who had to win a contest to get
on the boat, the Russos.

16:15.734 --> 16:17.667
Oh, that's how you know
you're full.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.367
Max! Dude, I'm in trouble.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.500
London Tipton thinks
I'm the rich Dr. Fossil,

16:27.500 --> 16:30.200
and she's on her way here
to take a picture with
the poor Russos.

16:30.200 --> 16:31.834
Oh, no. We're poor?

16:31.834 --> 16:35.100
Well then, I guess
I can't afford these.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.600
[water splashing]

16:41.600 --> 16:43.800
You're gonna be no help.

16:44.867 --> 16:47.500
Where am I gonna
get a disguise?

16:47.500 --> 16:50.200
- Harper!
- Hi, Justin!

16:50.200 --> 16:52.500
You're good with costumes,
right? I need you to...

16:52.500 --> 16:55.600
Well, I'm not sure I have
that material. Harper?!

16:56.467 --> 16:57.600
What are you doing here?

16:57.600 --> 17:00.233
I'm part of Alex's scheme.

17:00.233 --> 17:04.667
- I need you to be Alex Russo.
- That's also part of
Alex's scheme.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.033
- Great.
- [gasping]
There's London Tipton!

17:07.033 --> 17:10.800
You guys must be the Russos.
Max, Justin and Alex.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.700
- London, I know what
you're thinking...
- Yeah.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.033
I'm thinking I need to
get this photo op over with,

17:16.033 --> 17:18.567
so I can get back
to Dr. Fossil.

17:18.567 --> 17:22.734
Oh, my gosh. You look
just like him! [giggles]

17:22.734 --> 17:24.600
- And...
- [camera clicking]

17:24.600 --> 17:27.734
...you just met London Tipton.
Have a nice cruise.

17:28.934 --> 17:32.400
That girl is really dumb.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.600
And that's coming from me.

17:37.667 --> 17:42.233
- [slurping noises]
- Time! I finished first.

17:42.233 --> 17:45.300
No, I finished first.
This is exactly why I said

17:45.300 --> 17:47.000
we shouldn't drink
from the same cup.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.767
You can't tell
who finished first.

17:48.767 --> 17:52.033
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

17:52.033 --> 17:54.000
I have an idea how
we can settle this.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.233
- Settle what?
- Don't try to confuse me.

17:59.200 --> 18:01.900
Look, I'm gonna beat you at
luggage cart races tomorrow.

18:01.900 --> 18:03.734
[chuckling] Oh, you're on.

18:03.734 --> 18:05.200
Exactly.

18:08.734 --> 18:11.600
Hey, are we even doing
this right, Ashley?

18:11.600 --> 18:14.300
- Ashley...
- Olsen?

18:14.300 --> 18:15.600
That's it.

18:15.600 --> 18:17.934
Well, if the object
of the game

18:17.934 --> 18:20.500
is to see how many of these
things we can knock overboard,

18:20.500 --> 18:24.300
- I think we're winning.
- [water splashing]

18:29.834 --> 18:31.867
To see the cells
of this lobster,

18:31.867 --> 18:34.567
you'll stain them with tiny
amounts of methylene blue.

18:34.567 --> 18:40.000
- Stains are also how you
can tell me from my brother.
- [chuckling] Nice one!

18:40.000 --> 18:41.567
- Thanks.
- [giggling]

18:41.567 --> 18:44.500
Anyway. After that,
you'll prepare the lobster

18:44.500 --> 18:48.200
- with a little bit of butter
and tarragon.
- [both giggling]

18:52.767 --> 18:55.000
How long does it take
to get from the Atlantic Ocean

18:55.000 --> 18:56.600
to the middle
of the Pacific Ocean?

18:56.600 --> 19:01.367
- That's an excellent question,
Alex Russo.
- Well, that's me!

19:04.033 --> 19:06.700
It takes a month of constant
sailing at top speed

19:06.700 --> 19:08.233
if you go
through the Panama Canal.

19:08.233 --> 19:10.300
Or you could take the path
Magellan did in 1522

19:10.300 --> 19:12.667
and go around
Cape Horn, but...

19:12.667 --> 19:16.000
- But he died before he got
all the way home.
- Knowledge is cool.

19:16.000 --> 19:20.500
- So are dead explorers.
- You're an amazing student,
Alex Russo.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.734
Well, that's
Alex Russo for you.

19:23.567 --> 19:25.934
That's me. Alex Russo.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.700
- Isn't making pizza great,
Ashley?
- Yes.

19:29.700 --> 19:33.400
I love making my own food.
That's what Ashley...

19:33.400 --> 19:36.800
...Olsen does. Yes!
I gotta write that down.

19:37.667 --> 19:39.100
Alex, I need your help.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.400
[snorting] OK, well,
that's gonna be hard.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.900
There's no one named Alex here.
Just Bailey and Ashley Olsen.

19:44.900 --> 19:46.300
She taught me to spit.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.900
Well, I already
knew how to spit,

19:47.900 --> 19:50.200
but she made me OK
with doing it in public.

19:51.133 --> 19:52.800
Got it.
Part of the scheme.

19:52.800 --> 19:56.300
Ashley, I've got a problem.
Over here.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.734
OK, Alex,
I got exactly what I wanted...

20:01.734 --> 20:03.834
- ...a date with London Tipton.
- Great!

20:03.834 --> 20:06.900
- Not great. I lied to get her.
- Still great.

20:06.900 --> 20:10.600
No... I got exactly what
I wanted and now it's terrible,

20:10.600 --> 20:13.500
- because she's not so smart.
- What do you mean?

20:15.000 --> 20:19.233
- Max thinks she's dumb.
- Whoa. You gotta dump her.

20:19.233 --> 20:22.033
- I know.
- How are you gonna do it?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.934
- I'm just gonna tell her.
- Can I watch?

20:27.000 --> 20:29.400
- I'm not gonna cry.
- Ah.

20:29.400 --> 20:31.667
- Where's the finish line?
- The hot tub!

20:37.367 --> 20:39.734
- Watch out!
- [grunting]

20:42.867 --> 20:45.233
Oh my gosh. Bailey?

20:45.233 --> 20:46.700
[London] She's choking!

20:46.700 --> 20:48.000
Dr. Fossil, help her.

20:48.000 --> 20:50.400
- You're a doctor.
- I don't know how to save her.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.734
What kind of a doctor doesn't
know how to save a person?

20:52.734 --> 20:54.767
- Look, I was going to
tell you...
- Tell me what?

20:54.767 --> 20:56.867
That you're not
a very smart doctor?

20:57.667 --> 20:58.934
[choking, coughing]

20:59.967 --> 21:01.800
- Bailey!
- [coughing]

21:03.834 --> 21:06.133
- [grunting]
- [food splashes in water]

21:07.934 --> 21:11.400
- Bailey, are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.600
You just saved her life.
What's your name again?

21:13.600 --> 21:14.734
Ashley Simpson.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.600
You said Olsen.

21:19.100 --> 21:24.367
Yes, Ashley Simpson Olsen.

21:25.467 --> 21:26.967
No, it's not.
It's Alex.

21:26.967 --> 21:30.033
- Alex?
- Yeah, my sister, Alex Russo.

21:30.033 --> 21:32.400
- She's not Alex Russo.
- Harper!

21:32.400 --> 21:35.500
- Ha! That's Alex Russo.
- Harper!

21:35.500 --> 21:37.300
Harper! I got an "A"
on the first quiz.

21:37.300 --> 21:39.400
Wait a minute.
She just called you Harper.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.300
She called you Ashley.
And you called her Alex?

21:42.300 --> 21:44.367
OK, what is your name?!

21:44.367 --> 21:47.133
[Max] I'm gonna
clear this up right now.

21:47.133 --> 21:51.767
Her name is Alex Russo.
She's my sister. We... ah!

21:54.033 --> 21:56.467
London, I need to explain
something to you.

21:56.467 --> 21:59.567
OK. That girl, whatever
her real name is, saved Bailey.

21:59.567 --> 22:02.834
And you, Dr. Fossil, did not.
That is all I need to know.

22:02.834 --> 22:04.900
- You're a dumb doctor.
- [gasps]

22:04.900 --> 22:06.500
And I can't date
someone who's dumb.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.500
No matter how handsome
and smart you are.

22:08.500 --> 22:11.834
You're breaking up with me?
For being dumb?

22:11.834 --> 22:13.734
- Me?
- That's right.

22:15.734 --> 22:16.800
All right.

22:18.500 --> 22:20.200
- I am dumb.
- [London] Hm-hm.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.100
Because I thought
that was gonna be hard,

22:22.100 --> 22:24.600
- and you made it real easy.
- [scoffing] Yeah.

22:24.600 --> 22:27.233
You're so dumb, I don't even
know what you're talking about.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.000
- [clearing throat]
I've just gotta know something.
- Hm?

22:40.100 --> 22:41.600
Would you ever go out
with someone

22:41.600 --> 22:45.000
that worked in a sandwich shop
and wrote stories and essays?

22:45.000 --> 22:49.200
Including one that was good
enough to win him this cruise?

22:49.200 --> 22:51.133
That sounds like Justin Russo.
[scoffing]

22:51.133 --> 22:53.200
I should've gone out
with him instead of you.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.100
[gasps]
I wonder where he is?

23:00.100 --> 23:01.900
Well, at least I had fun
in the sun

23:01.900 --> 23:03.367
before I got stuck
in that class.

23:03.367 --> 23:06.467
At least I got to go on a cruise
I had no business being on.

23:06.467 --> 23:07.800
I'll see you when I get back.

23:12.767 --> 23:14.934
From east to west,
this spell's no jest.

23:14.934 --> 23:17.100
Wherever we roam,
send Harper back home.

23:18.834 --> 23:22.100
Oh! Wait, did I say
roam or home first?

23:22.100 --> 23:24.200
Eh, she'll like Rome.
