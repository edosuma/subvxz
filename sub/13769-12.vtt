Here we go! Yes!

I win! I win!

00:05.506 --> 00:09.134
I finally beat you

00:05.506 --> 00:09.134
in a video game.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.261
In your face, Malcolm.

00:09.176 --> 00:11.261
In your face.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.054
Dad, Dad...

00:11.303 --> 00:13.054
Yes!

00:13.096 --> 00:15.933
The goal of Video Golf

00:13.096 --> 00:15.933
is to get the  fewest  points.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.226
Oh...

00:18.268 --> 00:20.437

REESE:  No way.

00:55.138 --> 00:56.891
CRAIG: Okay, I'm going

00:55.138 --> 00:56.891
to do a load of colors,

00:56.932 --> 00:58.183
then a load of whites,

00:58.225 --> 01:01.228
so if you have any clothes

00:58.225 --> 01:01.228
in your room you want...

01:04.231 --> 01:06.984
Craig's been over here every day

01:04.231 --> 01:06.984
helping out with the chores

01:07.026 --> 01:08.193
since Mom went to her sister's.

01:08.235 --> 01:11.030
It was two weeks before we

01:08.235 --> 01:11.030
figured out nobody asked him.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.072
So Dad's in charge.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.116
Ow!

01:15.158 --> 01:16.535
Boys, quit horsing around

01:15.158 --> 01:16.535
and eat your dinner.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.786
Ah!

01:18.787 --> 01:20.121
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:20.163 --> 01:21.331
Stop it! Stop!

01:22.624 --> 01:24.501
Now we are at

01:22.624 --> 01:24.501
zero tolerance now!

01:24.543 --> 01:26.712
Do you hear me? Zero tolerance!

01:26.754 --> 01:27.713
You boys have got

01:27.755 --> 01:28.756
to learn to behave!

01:28.797 --> 01:30.007
From now on...

01:30.049 --> 01:31.174
Who wants more

01:30.049 --> 01:31.174
mac and cheese?

01:31.216 --> 01:32.927
All right. Move it.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.927
Yeah. Me first.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.136
That is it!

01:35.178 --> 01:37.096
Sit down!

01:39.098 --> 01:40.851
Just because your mother

01:39.098 --> 01:40.851
isn't here

01:40.893 --> 01:42.143
is no excuse to misbehave.

01:42.185 --> 01:43.979
Now when I say zero tolerance,

01:44.021 --> 01:46.398
I mean  zero  tolerance.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.608
Tolerance

01:47.649 --> 01:49.068
to the zero degree.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.570
I'm talking zip,

01:49.109 --> 01:51.570
nada, zilch.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.572
In terms of tolerance.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.448
(phone rings)

01:53.614 --> 01:54.448
I'll get it.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.157
Malcolm...

01:54.489 --> 01:56.157
Hello.

01:56.199 --> 01:57.200
We are having a discussion.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.326
It's Stevie, he needs help

01:58.368 --> 01:59.327
with his math homework.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.455
Go.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.832
So if your want to derive wave

02:01.496 --> 02:03.832
maps in two space dimensions,

02:03.874 --> 02:05.375
you have to make sure

02:05.417 --> 02:07.168
you're talking about

02:05.417 --> 02:07.168
equivariant wave maps or else...

02:07.210 --> 02:09.463
You can't keep calling me here.

02:09.504 --> 02:11.799
I was guessing that you'd

02:09.504 --> 02:11.799
get to the phone first.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.759
Nicki, if my parents figure out

02:11.840 --> 02:13.759
we're still going out,

02:13.801 --> 02:14.760
I'll get totally nailed.

02:14.802 --> 02:16.344
Then we'll never

02:14.802 --> 02:16.344
get to see each other.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.764
I know it's hard,

02:16.386 --> 02:18.764
but we have to be more careful.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.641
Well, I'm bored,

02:18.806 --> 02:20.641
and my dad's gone for a while.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.850
I'll be right over.

02:21.892 --> 02:24.185
HAL:

02:21.892 --> 02:24.185
Okay, that is it!

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
We are at zero

02:24.227 --> 02:26.229
tolerance now.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.898
Zero tolerance!

Once again you two

have blown off my socks.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.304
Francis, meet my nephew,

02:59.346 --> 03:00.472
Willy.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.265
He doesn't speak English.

03:02.307 --> 03:03.600
Hello.

03:03.642 --> 03:04.852
Willy will be

03:04.893 --> 03:06.103
staying with us until

03:06.145 --> 03:08.147
his work visa gets

03:06.145 --> 03:08.147
straightened out.

03:08.229 --> 03:09.230
GRETCHEN:

03:08.229 --> 03:09.230
Until then

03:09.272 --> 03:10.482
we will get to hear

03:10.524 --> 03:13.068
his wonderful playing

03:10.524 --> 03:13.068
every day, no?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.862
Otto, let's get

03:13.110 --> 03:14.862
our sheet music.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.071
We can do our duet of

03:16.113 --> 03:17.823
"Don't Go Breaking

03:16.113 --> 03:17.823
My Heart."

03:17.865 --> 03:20.241
Ja.  It is not so much a song

03:20.283 --> 03:22.953
as it is a lovers'

03:20.283 --> 03:22.953
conversation.

03:22.995 --> 03:23.912
Come.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.920
So...

03:31.962 --> 03:33.922
how do you like

03:31.962 --> 03:33.922
America?

03:37.551 --> 03:41.889
Well... nice to meet you.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.392
(music patterns matching

03:41.930 --> 03:45.392
Francis' steps)

03:57.487 --> 03:58.947
MALCOLM:

03:57.487 --> 03:58.947
It's so weird at my house.

03:58.989 --> 04:00.532
Nobody ever

03:58.989 --> 04:00.532
answers the phone.

04:00.574 --> 04:02.576
My brothers are seeing

04:00.574 --> 04:02.576
who can go the longest

04:02.617 --> 04:04.285
without changing

04:02.617 --> 04:04.285
their underwear.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.537
I never thought

04:04.327 --> 04:05.537
I'd miss my mom.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.331
I still don't,

04:05.579 --> 04:08.331
but I'm getting close.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.708
Well, it sounds like a drag,

04:09.750 --> 04:12.086
but at least it's going

04:09.750 --> 04:12.086
to be over in a month or two.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.921
Oh, by the way, did I

04:12.127 --> 04:13.921
tell you that my dad's

04:13.962 --> 04:15.547
going to bring Trish

04:13.962 --> 04:15.547
to my birthday party?

04:15.589 --> 04:17.091
Who's Trish?

04:17.132 --> 04:19.300
Trish-- the woman that

04:17.132 --> 04:19.300
my dad has been seeing

04:19.342 --> 04:21.762
for the past four months

04:19.342 --> 04:21.762
who totally hates me.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.013
Malcolm,

04:21.803 --> 04:23.013
I told you about her.

04:23.055 --> 04:25.306
Did I tell you

04:23.055 --> 04:25.306
my dad has taken

04:23.055 --> 04:25.306
away all my CDs?

04:25.348 --> 04:26.934
He says it's because

04:25.348 --> 04:26.934
I play them too loud,

04:26.975 --> 04:28.185
but I'm pretty

04:26.975 --> 04:28.185
sure I heard him

04:28.227 --> 04:29.310
listening to them

04:28.227 --> 04:29.310
in the garage.

04:29.352 --> 04:32.355
Malcolm, do you think for,

04:29.352 --> 04:32.355
like, once,

04:32.397 --> 04:34.315
we could talk about my problems?

04:34.357 --> 04:36.151
Oh. Okay, sure.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.946
Well, what are they?

04:38.987 --> 04:39.947
What are they?

04:39.988 --> 04:40.948
I've been sitting here...

04:40.989 --> 04:42.032
BOYD:

04:40.989 --> 04:42.032
Nicki?

04:44.952 --> 04:46.327
Were you talking to someone?

04:46.369 --> 04:47.537
Yeah, it's my secret boyfriend.

04:47.579 --> 04:48.789
He's hiding under the bed.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.707
Don't you

04:48.830 --> 04:50.707
want to check?

04:50.749 --> 04:53.376
Why does everything have to be

04:50.749 --> 04:53.376
a snotty remark with you?

04:53.418 --> 04:56.337
Well, according to Trish,

04:53.418 --> 04:56.337
it's the "normal reaction"

04:56.379 --> 04:59.216
for not being the only girl

04:56.379 --> 04:59.216
in my daddy's life anymore.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.342
Come on, Nicki,

04:59.258 --> 05:01.342
she was being nice.

05:01.384 --> 05:03.511
Well, it's none of her business

05:01.384 --> 05:03.511
how I feel about anything.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.429
She's not my mom.

05:04.471 --> 05:05.931
Nobody said anything

05:05.973 --> 05:07.975
about her being your mom.

05:08.016 --> 05:10.227
Maybe it's time

05:08.016 --> 05:10.227
we talked this out.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.272
Okay, what do you

05:11.561 --> 05:13.272
want to talk about?

05:13.354 --> 05:14.815
How much Trish

05:13.354 --> 05:14.815
hates me?

05:14.856 --> 05:16.608
You're not going to pick

05:14.856 --> 05:16.608
a fight to get out of this.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.153
We're going to hash this out

05:16.650 --> 05:19.153
if we have to sit here

05:19.194 --> 05:20.779
all night.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.364
HAL:

05:21.655 --> 05:23.364
Boys...

05:23.406 --> 05:25.075
Boys, come on,

05:23.406 --> 05:25.075
let's be reasonable.

05:25.117 --> 05:26.785
This is no way

05:25.117 --> 05:26.785
to treat your father.

05:27.661 --> 05:29.037
What kind of father are you?

05:29.079 --> 05:31.165
You're nothing but a joke,

05:29.079 --> 05:31.165
and you're weak.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.791
Oh, man, are you going

05:31.206 --> 05:32.791
to pay for that

05:32.833 --> 05:34.209
when your mother gets home!

05:34.251 --> 05:36.253
You still think

05:34.251 --> 05:36.253
Mom's coming back

05:36.295 --> 05:38.421
after the way

05:36.295 --> 05:38.421
you screwed things up?

05:39.338 --> 05:40.381
Dewey, what

05:39.338 --> 05:40.381
do you think

05:40.423 --> 05:41.382
you're doing?

05:41.424 --> 05:42.550
I'm lighting

05:41.424 --> 05:42.550
Dad on fire.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.178
No way. I get to do it.

05:44.219 --> 05:45.637
We'll all do it.

05:47.430 --> 05:48.347
(whimpering)

05:49.850 --> 05:51.392
(screaming)

05:51.434 --> 05:52.477
Oh, my God, honey.

05:52.519 --> 05:54.188
I just had the worst dream.

05:54.229 --> 05:57.232
The boys just...

05:54.229 --> 05:57.232
I-I lost control of them,

05:57.274 --> 05:59.567
and-and you were

05:57.274 --> 05:59.567
never coming home and...

05:59.609 --> 06:01.695
It was just awful.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.404
It's okay, sweetie.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.405
Go back to sleep.

06:04.447 --> 06:06.407
We'll spoon, okay?

06:06.449 --> 06:08.367
Okay.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.666
(gasping)

06:17.544 --> 06:19.921
(music playing)

06:21.673 --> 06:23.424
How come she's

06:21.673 --> 06:23.424
allowed to be naked

06:23.466 --> 06:25.219
on the kitchen table,

06:23.466 --> 06:25.219
and I'm not?

06:25.260 --> 06:26.427
Dewey, if a cop

06:26.469 --> 06:28.429
tells you to do something,

06:26.469 --> 06:28.429
you do it.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.430
(gasping)

06:29.472 --> 06:31.308
What are you boys doing?

06:31.350 --> 06:33.852
I told you to go

06:31.350 --> 06:33.852
to bed hours ago.

06:33.894 --> 06:37.022
Actually, Dad, your exact

06:33.894 --> 06:37.022
words were just, "Go to bed."

06:37.064 --> 06:39.274
You didn't say, "Go to bed  now."

06:39.316 --> 06:40.441
If you leave us

06:39.316 --> 06:40.441
a loophole like that,

06:40.483 --> 06:42.069
I don't see how

06:40.483 --> 06:42.069
this could be our fault.

06:42.110 --> 06:44.529
You have disrespected

06:42.110 --> 06:44.529
my authority for the last time!

06:44.571 --> 06:46.447
I'm at zero tolerance!

06:46.489 --> 06:50.327
I keep thinking that at

06:46.489 --> 06:50.327
some point I might be

06:46.489 --> 06:50.327
able to trust you boys

06:50.369 --> 06:52.329
to do as you're told,

06:50.369 --> 06:52.329
but I can't.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.455
Well, there are going to be

06:52.371 --> 06:54.455
some big changes around here.

06:54.497 --> 06:55.665
Very big changes.

06:55.707 --> 06:57.458
Now get to bed!

06:57.500 --> 06:58.459
Uh, wait.

06:58.501 --> 06:59.502
Um...

06:59.544 --> 07:00.837
could you repeat that?

07:00.879 --> 07:02.923
My mind kind of wandered

07:00.879 --> 07:02.923
toward the end.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.841
Don't push it, Reese.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.841
You know very well what I...

07:04.883 --> 07:05.842
(clattering)

07:05.884 --> 07:07.010
(shrieks)

07:08.511 --> 07:09.637
Hi, Dad.

07:09.679 --> 07:10.847
What are you...?

07:10.889 --> 07:13.350
Have you been out all night?

07:13.392 --> 07:15.476
Trust me, it wasn't my idea

07:13.392 --> 07:15.476
to be out this late.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.562
I suppose you were being

07:15.518 --> 07:17.562
held prisoner somewhere.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.316
I got home

07:19.147 --> 07:21.316
as quickly as I could.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.401
And besides,

07:22.442 --> 07:23.693
what are Reese and Dewey

07:22.442 --> 07:23.693
still doing up?

07:23.735 --> 07:25.112
Don't change the subject.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.696
You crossed the line, mister.

07:26.738 --> 07:29.490
And until further notice, there

07:26.738 --> 07:29.490
will be no TV, no computer

07:29.532 --> 07:34.495
and no video games because I am

07:29.532 --> 07:34.495
at zero tolerance with you boys!

07:34.537 --> 07:35.872
Is that understood?!

07:35.914 --> 07:37.916
Zero tolerance!

07:37.958 --> 07:40.501
What? Did you just

07:37.958 --> 07:40.501
roll your eyes at me?

07:40.543 --> 07:42.503
As long as you are

07:40.543 --> 07:42.503
living in this house,

07:42.545 --> 07:44.339
I demand your respect!

07:44.381 --> 07:45.382
For what?

07:45.424 --> 07:46.507
This house is a pigsty.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.508
Everything in the fridge

07:47.550 --> 07:48.509
has expired.

07:48.551 --> 07:50.345
I found a piece of cake

07:48.551 --> 07:50.345
in the shower.

07:50.387 --> 07:52.222
DEWEY:

07:50.387 --> 07:52.222
That's mine.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.515
And now you're screaming at me

07:52.264 --> 07:54.515
because you can't control them,

07:54.557 --> 07:55.516
and you know what?

07:55.558 --> 07:57.518
I'm sick of it.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.518
Oh, well, if that's

07:57.560 --> 07:59.687
the way you feel, you

07:57.560 --> 07:59.687
know where the door is.

07:59.729 --> 08:02.190
I do know where the door is,

07:59.729 --> 08:02.190
and I know how to use it!

08:02.232 --> 08:03.691
It's 3:00 in the morning.

08:03.733 --> 08:04.943
Everyone's a little upset...

08:04.985 --> 08:05.986
HAL:

08:04.985 --> 08:05.986
Then go ahead

08:06.027 --> 08:07.528
and use it!

08:06.027 --> 08:07.528
See if I care!

08:07.570 --> 08:08.529
Just turn the knob

08:08.571 --> 08:09.614
and pull.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.532
Oh, I'll turn

08:09.656 --> 08:11.532
the knob and pull.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.617
Just watch me!

08:12.659 --> 08:13.952
Turning and pulling!

08:13.994 --> 08:16.537
I'm watching, but I don't

08:13.994 --> 08:16.537
see you doing it.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.206
I  am  doing it.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.540
Turn. Pull.

08:19.582 --> 08:21.960
And now I'm outside!

08:22.002 --> 08:23.544
Congratulations!

08:23.586 --> 08:24.754
Would you like me

08:23.586 --> 08:24.754
to close the door?

08:24.796 --> 08:26.965
Yes, close the damn door!

08:27.966 --> 08:29.968
Thank you!

08:34.014 --> 08:36.224
Here comes the tearful apology.

08:36.266 --> 08:39.560
Three... two... one.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.980
(door locking)

08:51.114 --> 08:54.075
So exactly how many militias

08:51.114 --> 08:54.075
is your dad in?

08:54.117 --> 08:55.952
These are all

08:54.117 --> 08:55.952
of his Armageddon supplies

08:55.994 --> 08:57.787
for when the U.N. takes over

08:55.994 --> 08:57.787
the banks.

08:57.829 --> 08:59.206
Anyways, thanks for hiding me.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.874
I don't know where else

08:59.247 --> 09:00.874
I could've gone

09:00.915 --> 09:02.667
without somebody's parents

09:00.915 --> 09:02.667
turning me in.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.794
Well, I'm gonna get some sleep.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.794
I'll bring you a snack

09:04.836 --> 09:05.753
in the morning.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.838
You know,

09:06.880 --> 09:08.756
this is actually going

09:06.880 --> 09:08.756
to be pretty cool,

09:08.798 --> 09:11.259
having you hiding up here

09:08.798 --> 09:11.259
right over my bedroom.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.593
You're like my little secret.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.636
Help yourself

09:13.678 --> 09:14.804
to some snacks.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.223
Just be careful

09:14.846 --> 09:16.223
of the trip wire.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.598
There's darts tipped with...

09:17.640 --> 09:19.559
Just be careful

09:17.640 --> 09:19.559
of the trip wire.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.603
You kicked him out

09:21.269 --> 09:22.603
of the house?

09:22.645 --> 09:25.106
Oh, please. He kicked himself

09:22.645 --> 09:25.106
out of the house, Craig.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.608
Look, I've been through this

09:25.148 --> 09:27.608
before with Reese and Francis.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.277
It never lasts long.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.612
When Reese was kicked out,

09:29.319 --> 09:31.612
he spent the night on the roof

09:31.654 --> 09:33.698
until he got into a fight

09:31.654 --> 09:33.698
with a pack of cats.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.034
So that makes it

09:33.740 --> 09:36.034
okay that Malcolm

09:33.740 --> 09:36.034
spent the night

09:36.076 --> 09:37.618
sleeping on a booze-

09:36.076 --> 09:37.618
soaked mattress

09:37.660 --> 09:38.870
in some dark alley?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.870
Craig...

09:38.912 --> 09:40.663
Oh, my God! He's

09:38.912 --> 09:40.663
probably dead by now!

09:40.705 --> 09:42.623
Malcolm can take care

09:40.705 --> 09:42.623
of himself.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.210
You're right, you're right. He's

09:42.665 --> 09:45.210
a genius, which would make him

09:45.252 --> 09:47.628
even more attractive

09:45.252 --> 09:47.628
to rogue elements

09:45.252 --> 09:47.628
in our secret weapons programs.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.796
How long before

09:48.838 --> 09:50.631
some government scientist

09:48.838 --> 09:50.631
picks him up

09:50.673 --> 09:53.093
and tries to surgically

09:50.673 --> 09:53.093
attach him to some animal?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.635
(groans)

09:54.677 --> 09:57.514
(piano playing softly)

10:03.728 --> 10:07.399
(music patterns matching

10:03.728 --> 10:07.399
Francis' actions)

10:24.999 --> 10:26.667
(music stops)

10:26.709 --> 10:28.545
(music patterns begin again)

10:39.556 --> 10:41.433
(dramatic tune playing)

10:42.559 --> 10:43.560
Stop playing.

10:43.602 --> 10:45.686
No more piano.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.481
No pi-a-no!

10:47.522 --> 10:49.357
Just stop playing!

10:49.399 --> 10:51.651
Ich verstehe nicht.

10:57.740 --> 10:58.699
HAL:

10:57.740 --> 10:58.699
You let me know

10:58.741 --> 11:00.577
if you hear anything at all.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.120
Oh, my God, he's been

11:00.619 --> 11:02.120
gone for over a day.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.413
Where the hell is he?!

11:03.455 --> 11:04.623
Keep it down!

11:04.664 --> 11:06.666
The neighbors don't have

11:04.664 --> 11:06.666
to know our business.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.631
How can you be smiling

11:10.587 --> 11:12.631
right now?

11:12.671 --> 11:14.633
Because I just realized--

11:12.671 --> 11:14.633
we have a free pass.

11:14.673 --> 11:15.716
What do you mean?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.718
Can't you see how

11:15.758 --> 11:17.718
guilty Dad feels?

11:17.760 --> 11:20.347
He's not going to punish

11:17.760 --> 11:20.347
anybody else for a while.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.722
We're bulletproof.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.891
What are you going

11:21.764 --> 11:23.891
to do?

11:21.764 --> 11:23.891
I'm not sure yet.

11:23.933 --> 11:26.144
This is a once-in-a-

11:23.933 --> 11:26.144
lifetime opportunity.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.729
It's got to be

11:26.186 --> 11:28.729
perfect and huge.

11:28.771 --> 11:33.234
I want this to be

11:28.771 --> 11:33.234
a statement about

11:28.771 --> 11:33.234
everything I stand for.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.697
Okay, watch this.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.813
Okay, I don't know

12:08.895 --> 12:10.813
what happened...

12:10.855 --> 12:11.939
I know what happened.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.150
You have been riding

12:11.981 --> 12:14.150
those horses too much.

12:14.192 --> 12:15.652
We have an ointment, Francis.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.153
You put it

12:15.694 --> 12:17.153
on your  leistengegend,

12:17.195 --> 12:18.779
and it will be as good as new.

12:18.821 --> 12:19.822
OTTO:

12:18.821 --> 12:19.822
It's good stuff,

12:18.821 --> 12:19.822
Francis.

12:19.864 --> 12:20.990
It's tingly.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.242
Ja.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.242
Come on.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.456
(Scotch tape tearing)

12:33.920 --> 12:37.465
(staple gun clicking)

12:40.635 --> 12:41.969
Excuse me.

12:40.635 --> 12:41.969
What?

12:42.011 --> 12:44.180
Uh, your poster, it's

12:42.011 --> 12:44.180
distracting people

12:44.222 --> 12:46.433
from my poster, and

12:44.222 --> 12:46.433
mine was there first.

12:46.474 --> 12:47.975
So? It's not your tree.

12:48.017 --> 12:50.103
Look, I-I'm sure that

12:48.017 --> 12:50.103
your dog-- Milton--

12:50.144 --> 12:52.272
is very sweet and you

12:50.144 --> 12:52.272
love him very much,

12:52.313 --> 12:53.814
but I'm looking for my son.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.024
An actual human being

12:55.066 --> 12:56.693
who's been missing

12:55.066 --> 12:56.693
for two days.

12:56.735 --> 12:58.819
Now don't you think

12:56.735 --> 12:58.819
finding a lost  person

12:58.861 --> 13:00.821
is more important than

12:58.861 --> 13:00.821
finding a lost dog?

13:00.863 --> 13:01.989
I don't know your kid,

13:02.031 --> 13:04.200
but from the way

13:02.031 --> 13:04.200
my mom and dad talk,

13:04.242 --> 13:07.036
your whole family isn't worth

13:04.242 --> 13:07.036
as much as my dog.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.496
You li...

13:08.538 --> 13:09.830
(chuckles)

13:09.872 --> 13:11.708
What's your name?

13:11.750 --> 13:12.667
Patrick.

13:12.709 --> 13:13.834
Let me tell you

13:13.876 --> 13:15.336
a little something

13:13.876 --> 13:15.336
about your dog.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.546
He's gone, see?

13:16.588 --> 13:18.089
Some other family

13:16.588 --> 13:18.089
has taken him in.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.466
And right now

13:18.131 --> 13:19.466
that family

13:19.507 --> 13:22.719
is pampering Milton in ways

13:19.507 --> 13:22.719
you never even dreamed of.

13:22.761 --> 13:24.512
So your dog

13:22.761 --> 13:24.512
already loves them

13:24.554 --> 13:26.556
a lot more than

13:24.554 --> 13:26.556
he ever loved you.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.099
And if you ever

13:26.598 --> 13:28.099
did get him back,

13:28.141 --> 13:29.476
oh, he would just resent you

13:29.517 --> 13:31.311
until he found some

13:29.517 --> 13:31.311
way to escape again.

13:31.352 --> 13:33.647
So, why don't you just

13:31.352 --> 13:33.647
take the poster down, okay?

13:33.688 --> 13:34.897
Take your poster down.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.191
Your kid's probably

13:34.939 --> 13:37.191
in a crack house.

13:38.526 --> 13:39.319
Ha!

13:39.360 --> 13:40.695
Ha!

13:41.529 --> 13:42.572
Ha!

13:42.614 --> 13:43.782
Ha!

13:43.822 --> 13:45.408
(Hal shrieks)

13:46.618 --> 13:49.621
(Hal panting frantically)

13:54.917 --> 13:56.877
Hey.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.755
I brought you some food.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.465
I can't believe I'm being

13:58.797 --> 14:00.465
forced to live in an attic,

14:00.507 --> 14:02.258
living off someone else's

14:00.507 --> 14:02.258
table scraps.

14:02.300 --> 14:04.177
Do you mind if I sit with you

14:02.300 --> 14:04.177
for a little bit?

14:04.218 --> 14:05.886
I'm really pissed

14:04.218 --> 14:05.886
at my dad right now.

14:05.928 --> 14:06.887
You're pissed

14:05.928 --> 14:06.887
at  your  dad?!

14:06.929 --> 14:08.556
Could you listen for a sec?

14:08.598 --> 14:09.890
My dad just told me

14:08.598 --> 14:09.890
that he's dragging me

14:09.932 --> 14:12.059
on some camping trip

14:09.932 --> 14:12.059
with him and Trish.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.688
I can't spend an entire weekend

14:12.101 --> 14:14.688
in a tent with that woman.

14:14.729 --> 14:15.896
He provoked the whole thing.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.607
He could've stopped

14:15.938 --> 14:17.607
me from walking out

14:17.649 --> 14:18.941
of the door if he'd

14:17.649 --> 14:18.941
really wanted to.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.152
Malcolm, I think it would be

14:18.983 --> 14:21.152
a really good idea

14:21.194 --> 14:23.822
if you would listen to me

14:21.194 --> 14:23.822
right now, do you understand?

14:23.863 --> 14:25.198
If you listen

14:23.863 --> 14:25.198
to what I'm saying,

14:25.239 --> 14:26.991
then you can give it

14:25.239 --> 14:26.991
some thought.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.702
And then we can talk it out

14:28.743 --> 14:30.411
in a way that's going

14:28.743 --> 14:30.411
to help me.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.912
And then I can do the same

14:30.453 --> 14:31.912
for you.

14:31.954 --> 14:32.913
Then we could have

14:32.955 --> 14:34.499
a conversation

14:32.955 --> 14:34.499
that actually matters.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.917
No!

14:34.541 --> 14:36.917
He had to act like a  big  man.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.919
What was he trying to prove?

14:38.961 --> 14:40.547
That's it.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.089
That's what?

14:42.131 --> 14:43.800
I can't take this anymore.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.302
You are the most selfish,

14:43.842 --> 14:46.302
thoughtless person

14:46.344 --> 14:47.721
that I have ever seen.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.930
From now on, I am

14:47.762 --> 14:49.930
not your girlfriend.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.307
You're breaking up with me?

14:51.349 --> 14:52.933
You have  killed

14:52.975 --> 14:55.353
everything I have

14:52.975 --> 14:55.353
ever felt for you.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.353
It's over!

14:55.395 --> 14:57.564
But, but what am I going to do?

14:57.605 --> 14:59.190
I never want to

14:57.605 --> 14:59.190
see you again!

15:07.365 --> 15:09.367
HAL (over loudspeaker):

15:07.365 --> 15:09.367
Just come home, Malcolm.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.786
If you want me to apologize,

15:09.409 --> 15:11.786
I will.

15:11.828 --> 15:13.454
I was wrong, and you

15:13.496 --> 15:14.955
were totally right

15:13.496 --> 15:14.955
about everything.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.584
Geez, Dad, hold something back.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.377
Who cares what started all this?

15:19.419 --> 15:20.837
It doesn't matter.

15:20.879 --> 15:23.423
I just want you back

15:20.879 --> 15:23.423
because you're my son.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.050
And you're the only one

15:23.464 --> 15:26.050
in this family who has a chance

15:26.092 --> 15:28.010
of amounting to anything.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.010
What?

15:28.052 --> 15:30.137
(over speaker):

15:28.052 --> 15:30.137
It's not true, son.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.137
I was just trying to...

15:30.179 --> 15:31.639
(turns speaker off)

15:31.681 --> 15:34.851
I'm just trying to

15:31.681 --> 15:34.851
get Malcolm home.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.853
Ignore that last part, Malcolm.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.853
You're our only hope.

15:36.895 --> 15:37.937
Please, come home.

15:36.895 --> 15:37.937
I love you.

15:39.272 --> 15:42.024
(panting)

15:42.066 --> 15:44.277
So my dad kicked me out

15:42.066 --> 15:44.277
of the house,

15:44.318 --> 15:46.028
then Nicki broke up with me.

15:46.070 --> 15:48.030
I don't know how long ago

15:46.070 --> 15:48.030
it was.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.950
I can't remember

15:48.072 --> 15:50.950
if these mean hours or days.

15:56.831 --> 15:58.999
That's Nicki.

15:59.041 --> 16:01.001
(panting)

16:01.043 --> 16:03.003
Did you hear that?

16:03.045 --> 16:06.299
That's her talking.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.092
What's she laughing about?

16:08.134 --> 16:10.595
She can't be laughing.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.264
She's not laughing,

16:10.637 --> 16:13.264
she's crying.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.849
Just like my dad.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.017
They're all suffering now.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.645
(chuckles deliriously)

16:24.567 --> 16:27.528
(music patterns

16:24.567 --> 16:27.528
matching actions)

16:36.663 --> 16:41.250
Okay, Willy, here goes.

16:41.292 --> 16:50.050
I know you are trying to

16:41.292 --> 16:50.050
be friendly, but...

16:50.092 --> 16:55.306
...what your armchair are doing

16:50.092 --> 16:55.306
is make me feel bad.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.442
Crybaby bastard.

17:06.484 --> 17:07.318
(inhales sharply)

17:09.362 --> 17:13.073
No, I'm not going to give

17:09.362 --> 17:13.073
you the satisfaction.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.117
I'm not going to get mad.

17:15.159 --> 17:18.078
(serene tune playing)

17:19.330 --> 17:21.624
Okay, Willy, you

17:19.330 --> 17:21.624
want it, you got it!

17:26.128 --> 17:27.338
Come on, Willy!

17:27.380 --> 17:28.756
Make some music to this!

17:28.798 --> 17:30.800
Where's your music now, Willy?!

17:30.842 --> 17:33.845
Where's your music now?!

17:42.353 --> 17:45.147
He was... playing music...

17:45.189 --> 17:47.107
while I...

17:47.149 --> 17:49.527
did stuff.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.789
(choking)

18:01.831 --> 18:03.290
(gasping)

18:03.332 --> 18:05.793
(coughing harshly)

18:08.755 --> 18:12.550
Okay, maybe Nicki could have

18:08.755 --> 18:12.550
at least left me a paper cup

18:12.592 --> 18:14.134
or something up here.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.721
(whimpering):

18:14.176 --> 18:16.721
I just wish she'd come back

18:14.176 --> 18:16.721
to say hello.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.932
I miss talking to her.

18:18.973 --> 18:21.308
I was going to be

18:18.973 --> 18:21.308
her little secret.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.727
(sniffles)

18:22.769 --> 18:24.604
She's so incredible.

18:24.645 --> 18:27.982
I can't believe

18:24.645 --> 18:27.982
she ever liked me.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.317
I had Nicki and I had a family.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.527
What happened?

18:31.569 --> 18:34.113
How did it ever get like this?

18:35.406 --> 18:38.993
My God, I'm horrible.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.161
No wonder my dad kicked me out

18:39.035 --> 18:41.161
of the house.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.957
I'm annoying and selfish.

18:43.998 --> 18:45.625
Nicki and my family are lucky.

18:45.666 --> 18:47.877
At least they get

18:45.666 --> 18:47.877
to get away from me.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.504
I'm stuck here with myself.

18:54.092 --> 18:56.176
Wait a second.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.471
I don't have to be like this.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.180
I can change.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.683
I can totally change.

19:02.725 --> 19:06.104
From now on, I'll just listen

19:02.725 --> 19:06.104
to what people say.

19:06.145 --> 19:09.023
I'll be friendly.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.275
I'll be considerate.

19:11.317 --> 19:13.193
(laughs):

19:11.317 --> 19:13.193
Yeah.

19:13.235 --> 19:17.156
Yeah, I like this new Malcolm.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.451
(sniffs)

19:20.493 --> 19:23.203
(groans)

19:23.245 --> 19:24.204
(distant murmuring)

19:24.246 --> 19:26.082
That's her.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.751
(panting)

19:30.336 --> 19:32.797
What's she talking about?

19:32.839 --> 19:34.674
That's a guy's voice.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.217
There's a guy in her room.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.219
A guy in her room!

19:39.261 --> 19:40.471
NICKI:

19:39.261 --> 19:40.471
I am telling you

19:40.513 --> 19:41.848
he is not here!

19:42.890 --> 19:44.183
(yelps)

19:49.647 --> 19:50.898
REESE:

19:49.647 --> 19:50.898
This moment has been

19:50.940 --> 19:52.399
a long time coming.

19:52.441 --> 19:55.235
The fruit of over two hours

19:52.441 --> 19:55.235
of planning and labor.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.195
Thank you.

20:13.087 --> 20:16.298
Try as I might, I just can't

20:13.087 --> 20:16.298
find a flaw in this plan.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.301
Behold!

20:21.762 --> 20:22.555
(grunts)

20:24.306 --> 20:26.266
(Reese screaming)

20:26.308 --> 20:27.977
Turn it off!

20:28.019 --> 20:29.187
Stop it!

20:29.228 --> 20:31.271
Dewey, aah!

20:31.313 --> 20:32.899
Dewey!

20:32.940 --> 20:35.359
Guys, come back!

20:35.401 --> 20:37.070
For the love of God, help me!

20:37.111 --> 20:38.237
Stop it!

20:40.114 --> 20:41.281
CRAIG:

20:40.114 --> 20:41.281
Reese,

20:41.323 --> 20:42.241
what are you doing?

20:42.950 --> 20:45.703
(screams)

20:45.745 --> 20:47.955
Whoa...

20:56.338 --> 20:57.548
(water running, Reese sobbing)

20:57.590 --> 20:59.008
Help!

20:59.050 --> 21:01.719
Oh, why me?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.303
(sighs heavily)

21:03.345 --> 21:05.305
Welcome home, son.

21:05.347 --> 21:07.307
Thanks, Dad.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.810
Help me!

21:09.852 --> 21:12.312
If it helps, this probably

21:09.852 --> 21:12.312
would have happened

21:12.354 --> 21:13.313
even if Mom  was  here.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.523
Someone, please!

21:13.355 --> 21:14.523
It does help.

21:14.565 --> 21:16.442
I have to go to

21:14.565 --> 21:16.442
the bathroom.
