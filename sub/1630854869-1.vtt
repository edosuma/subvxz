WEBVTT

01:14.491 --> 01:15.909
Hit me again, Nat.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.709
Hey there, fella. My eyes are up here.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.381
Bottoms up.

01:37.764 --> 01:39.057
How's that soup there, boss?

01:40.559 --> 01:41.560
It's probably cold.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.648
Well, at least the oyster crackers
are still shipshape.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.489
So, is the wife dying?

01:54.990 --> 01:57.701
- What?
- Or did she pass away already?

01:57.701 --> 01:59.661
Is that what you're over here drinking at?

02:00.162 --> 02:01.914
I'm just after some peace and quiet.

02:02.664 --> 02:04.541
Well, that's good news about the wife.

02:07.211 --> 02:11.173
Family. Man's top treasure.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.802
Your house didn't burn down, did it?

02:16.887 --> 02:21.808
Look, mister,
I got enough problems of my own.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.188
I don't need you coming in here
and making up more for me, okay?

02:26.188 --> 02:29.399
Wait, I got it. It just hit me.
You're just a good man.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.402
You worked hard your whole life to give
this family the life that they deserve,

02:32.402 --> 02:34.238
and it adds up to you're drowning in debt.

02:34.905 --> 02:39.409
And all the latest-greatest, useless junk.
And your ulcer and hemorrhoids.

02:39.409 --> 02:43.080
Of course, not heartburn,
like you guzzled jet fuel and lit a cigar,

02:43.080 --> 02:45.624
makes laying down
to sleep every night a torture.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.084
But who needs sleep?

02:48.335 --> 02:50.879
When they gave your job of 30 years
to some floating tin can

02:50.879 --> 02:52.714
and your dignity along with it, right?

02:52.714 --> 02:54.508
So, it's no surprise, no shame.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.803
But you're over here daydreaming
the getaway of a lifetime,

02:57.803 --> 02:59.888
straight down,
right off the nearest bridge.

03:07.271 --> 03:09.940
I'll tell you, the fact
that you haven't slugged me yet,

03:09.940 --> 03:13.485
it means that you've got
enough hope left in you

03:13.485 --> 03:16.905
to hear the one word
that is gonna save your life.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.075
You get hit a lot?

03:20.909 --> 03:25.789
Well, every time I'm wrong.
But it's been a while.

03:32.462 --> 03:34.214
You left out the part I got a daughter

03:34.214 --> 03:36.341
who don't pick up the phone when I call.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.344
You got a magic word that fixes that one?

03:39.344 --> 03:41.847
First, I just wanna show you something, okay?

03:45.184 --> 03:46.185
What's that?

03:46.185 --> 03:48.353
That is from the Sea of Serenity.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.481
It's 243,000 miles above us,
on the bright side of the moon.

03:51.481 --> 03:54.651
My son picked that out for me.
That's my prized possession.

04:02.451 --> 04:03.452
Wow.

04:04.036 --> 04:05.871
Well, there you go. You said it yourself.

04:05.871 --> 04:07.873
- What?
- "Wow."

04:09.374 --> 04:14.296
That's the one word
none of us can live without.

04:14.296 --> 04:17.216
And I will promise you this,
hand on heart,

04:17.216 --> 04:20.385
hundreds of happy folks to vouch.
You'll be saying,

04:20.928 --> 04:24.681
"Wow, I love living on the moon."

04:29.102 --> 04:32.731
- That's another thing I can't afford.
- Where'd you see a price tag?

04:32.731 --> 04:35.025
I'm not stupid, mister.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.194
No, you're just so beat down,

04:37.194 --> 04:39.738
you see something you like,
you think it's out of reach.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.828
Hey there, fella. My eyes are up here.

04:51.583 --> 04:55.379
- Is this the one here with the pool? Or--
- That's the same model that I'm in.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.881
I'll tell you what, it's big enough
that you can invite the mother-in-law

04:57.881 --> 04:59.341
and not see her for days.

05:00.759 --> 05:01.593
You have that?

05:01.593 --> 05:04.221
Yep. Me and my family,
right there in the C-Plex.

05:06.598 --> 05:07.599
Wow.

05:09.268 --> 05:11.728
Why don't I take it home?
I'll give it a think.

05:11.728 --> 05:14.356
Oh, right. The pros and cons.

05:14.356 --> 05:15.732
Exactly.

05:15.732 --> 05:19.111
You know who does pros and cons?
Hunks of metal like her.

05:20.696 --> 05:25.242
Which is why she'll never fall in love
or drive too fast or have kids

05:25.242 --> 05:28.287
or do any of the crazy things
that make life worth the price.

05:28.287 --> 05:30.497
And it's why she's stuck
in the same day, every day.

05:30.497 --> 05:34.668
While fools like me and you,

05:36.170 --> 05:38.005
we get to dream on a better tomorrow.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.633
Shit. You're smiling.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.470
- You know that?
- Jesus Christ. This is nuts.

05:45.470 --> 05:51.768
How's it feel to be back among the living?
This time, don't let it slip away.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.270
- What's that?
- That's just what we said.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.731
Zero down, 150 a month,
and it's yours for a scribble.

05:55.731 --> 05:58.609
Hey. You wake up tomorrow,
you don't like it, we rip it right up.

05:58.609 --> 06:01.278
But, you know what?
There is a catch, though.

06:01.278 --> 06:04.239
You've got to promise me
that you're gonna call your daughter.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.910
And you tell her life is too short
and you love her.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.369
And her room is ready

06:09.369 --> 06:12.331
whenever she wants to fly up
and spend some time with Dad.

06:14.917 --> 06:15.918
Okay.

06:30.724 --> 06:32.017
<i>Morning, friend.</i>

06:35.854 --> 06:37.314
<i>Hello, neighbor.</i>

06:50.661 --> 06:53.080
<i>Have a bright, smiling day.</i>

07:03.298 --> 07:04.842
All right, honey. I'll see you tonight.

07:05.717 --> 07:06.718
Bye, sweetie.

07:12.683 --> 07:15.769
<i>Hi, there. I'm out delivering smiles.</i>

07:15.769 --> 07:18.856
Such a nice bird.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.691
<i>Here's my next stop.</i>

07:37.833 --> 07:39.543
<i>Oops. After you.</i>

07:42.713 --> 07:45.757
<i>Hi, there. I'm out delivering smiles.</i>

07:55.058 --> 07:59.563
No one here is not a dreamer, am I right?

07:59.563 --> 08:05.611
Not in a world like this,
where you can have it all.

08:12.993 --> 08:16.496
And that's what I want for you
and your families.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.751
You wake up to the earthrise
out your bedroom window.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.711
Your wife out on her lunar garden.

08:22.711 --> 08:25.464
Your boy shagging flies
on the zero-G diamond.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.967
That's the dream you all deserve.
I mean, come on.

08:28.967 --> 08:33.388
Why should the rich and the famous
get our moon all to themselves? No, sir.

08:33.388 --> 08:34.472
The Brightside,

08:34.472 --> 08:38.852
that's a place for real people
to start fresh, unwind, retire.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.522
Not to mention, you own an asset
your kids will be grateful for.

08:41.522 --> 08:44.858
So, please, take a minute. Just a minute.

08:45.526 --> 08:48.862
And sit down
with our top-notch sales associates.

08:48.862 --> 08:53.200
And start living
your brighter tomorrow, today. All right?

08:55.494 --> 08:58.080
All right.
Thanks for listening. Thank you.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.584
Warm room, Jack. Nice work.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.379
I'm gonna have cramping
from all the closing shakes in here.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.798
I think I may have enjoyed your speech
the most of anyone.

09:07.798 --> 09:08.882
Good. Okay.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.093
Ed, you take the new parents up front.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.845
Remind them life is still fun sometimes.

09:12.845 --> 09:15.013
Easy money. God, how babies adore me.

09:15.013 --> 09:18.267
Herb, you take Granny and Gramps.
Golf, golf, and no taxes.

09:18.267 --> 09:19.560
Got it, got it, and got it.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.812
No excuses for not cleaning up in here.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.940
I can close in here
with multiple seeping cold sores, okay?

09:24.940 --> 09:27.109
And I'm going to have
an excellent sales performance.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.694
- I think I just said that.
- Hey, guys.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.195
Remember, we're not just selling.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.406
- We're changing lives.
- Changing lives.

09:32.406 --> 09:33.866
- Got it. Got it.
- Done.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.829
You see that gentleman
over there and his daughter?

09:38.829 --> 09:40.372
They're ready to go.
Take care of him, okay?

09:40.372 --> 09:42.624
Upgrades, perks, everything we got.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.043
Usually I run those by HQ.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.713
Oh, Shirl, we're gonna make them
so much goddamn money tonight,

09:47.713 --> 09:49.339
we can afford to be good people.

09:49.965 --> 09:53.719
Mr. Jack Billings, please.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.021
- Damn it.
- What?

10:05.522 --> 10:08.609
It's from the moon. Stan Jenkins.

10:08.609 --> 10:11.278
He wants us pushing through
to Vistaville tomorrow.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.529
Well, he's an idiot.

10:13.030 --> 10:15.365
There's good money here,
and that's an all-night drive.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.243
Easy, Shirl.
He did build this company from scratch.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.745
And now he's sitting on the moon

10:19.745 --> 10:21.872
thinking he knows our turf
better than we do.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.874
Yeah, so maybe he's an idiot too.

10:24.708 --> 10:26.835
But don't the folks of Vistaville

10:26.835 --> 10:29.421
deserve to live their dreams
like everybody else?

10:46.355 --> 10:49.858
<i>Whizzing out to second.
Leaving fliers flying in all six zones.</i>

10:49.858 --> 10:52.069
I've been thinking
about what you said, Ed.

10:52.903 --> 10:57.616
About moving up there.
The moon might be nice.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.243
Yeah, not for your husband.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.330
So everybody gets what they deserve.

11:04.915 --> 11:08.085
No. Yeah? Really?

11:08.877 --> 11:14.174
Yeah? Well then, here I come, Vistaville,
'cause my baby and me...

11:14.800 --> 11:16.426
are going to the moon. Really?

11:21.723 --> 11:25.769
You ever worked Vistaville?
Just any tips from past experience.

11:26.270 --> 11:31.817
Yeah, but it was forever ago.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.697
You sound almost worried, Jack.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.578
<i>Seven up, and what a whiz that is.
Boy, I thought that was it.</i>

11:42.578 --> 11:43.871
Yes. Come on.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.543
What's this fun time about to cost you?

11:49.543 --> 11:51.795
A medium amount, Shirley.
We never assume defeat. Come on.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.882
<i>And the throw's in, and he's out.</i>

11:54.882 --> 11:57.217
- No, he's not!
- <i>No zone!</i>

11:57.217 --> 12:01.054
You cross-eyed half-wit limp-noodle bums!

12:01.054 --> 12:03.348
Was that your big plan to get us up there?

12:05.017 --> 12:06.602
I got some family there, is all.

12:08.353 --> 12:12.441
That's great. I mean,
family is a top source of inspiration.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.276
And motivation.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.820
Like, I think I told you
my Betty is expecting.

12:18.030 --> 12:21.825
Twins. Which they say
is two and a half times the cost.

12:22.826 --> 12:26.038
I keep telling her, I've been
working with Brightside two months now.

12:26.038 --> 12:28.790
- Well, nine weeks, almost.
- Yeah, we're here, Herb.

12:29.374 --> 12:30.334
Of course. Perfect.

12:30.334 --> 12:32.794
Yeah. Why don't you head in?
I got a stop to make.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.672
Whatever it is, I'd love to help.

12:35.672 --> 12:38.467
You just start ringing those doorbells
and fill the seats for me.

12:39.218 --> 12:41.637
Which I can do. Of course. You know?

12:42.513 --> 12:43.972
Got it. Thanks.

12:49.686 --> 12:52.397
Good morning, guest.
Can I help with your bags?

12:56.527 --> 12:58.111
You win again.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.830
- Oh, Ma.
- Jacky. Come.

13:08.830 --> 13:11.917
Your note said you were dying. Come on.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.961
Well, you wish it were true.

13:13.961 --> 13:18.090
- No.
- One of these days it will be,

13:18.090 --> 13:22.386
and you'll regret every minute
you left me alone in this gulag.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.221
It's been a busy couple of months for me.

13:24.221 --> 13:27.349
I'm with a new outfit, Regional Manager.
I think I told you.

13:27.349 --> 13:31.019
Doesn't matter, Jacky.
Nothing matters anymore.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.855
It's all too sad in too many ways.

13:32.855 --> 13:36.733
I know. But whatever it is,
we always get through it, right?

13:37.693 --> 13:38.861
Not this time.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.948
It's Marie, Jack. Your Marie.

13:42.948 --> 13:44.867
She's in the hospital.

13:44.867 --> 13:50.539
Run down outside her house by one
of those vans with the goddamn bird.

13:52.124 --> 13:53.792
And poor Joey.

13:53.792 --> 13:58.130
Your baby boy's mother in a coma.
How can anyone stand it?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.801
Yeah, I know.

14:04.178 --> 14:05.262
You know what?

14:05.262 --> 14:06.930
I don't know--

14:06.930 --> 14:11.143
He's, you know-- He's almost 20 now.

14:12.394 --> 14:13.979
He wouldn't even recognize me.

14:15.063 --> 14:16.982
Don't try to fool me, Jack.

14:18.192 --> 14:20.569
I can tell, you're heartbroken.

14:22.070 --> 14:25.824
Ma, she hasn't been my Marie for 18 years.

14:25.824 --> 14:28.118
And, sure, we all wish
it worked out better.

14:28.118 --> 14:30.537
But I think everybody has moved on
except for you.

14:30.537 --> 14:34.875
It's not too late. Go see them.

14:35.375 --> 14:39.755
They don't need me
screwing things up for them

14:39.755 --> 14:41.173
more than they already are.

14:41.173 --> 14:42.883
What a wiz you are,

14:42.883 --> 14:46.053
for talking yourself
out of every hard part of life!

14:46.053 --> 14:47.638
I'm here, aren't I?

14:57.523 --> 14:59.066
Hey, how is the new room working out?

14:59.066 --> 15:00.734
This garden view is nice, huh?

15:01.985 --> 15:03.946
You were the same with your father.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.408
You know, I got people to meet. Gotta go.

15:08.408 --> 15:11.078
Don't leave yet, Jacky. Five more minutes.

15:12.079 --> 15:13.664
Love you, Ma. Next time, okay?

15:15.749 --> 15:19.169
Go see them! Your boy needs you.

15:19.920 --> 15:23.507
<i>Three, two, one, blastoff.</i>

15:24.091 --> 15:26.927
<i>To a new beginning beyond the stars.</i>

15:26.927 --> 15:28.804
<i>Luna, mother of dreams.</i>

15:28.804 --> 15:31.598
<i>First, she was
Earth's most critical mining resource,</i>

15:31.598 --> 15:33.809
<i>then the play-place of the upper crust.</i>

15:33.809 --> 15:37.646
<i>But now, thanks to visionary entrepreneur
Mr. Stanley Jenkins</i>

15:37.646 --> 15:39.439
<i>and the Brightside Corporation,</i>

15:39.439 --> 15:42.985
<i>she is host to the moon-based community
all of us deserve.</i>

15:42.985 --> 15:44.987
<i>Our collection of fully-furnished</i>

15:44.987 --> 15:48.031
<i>and value-priced units
fit the family budget.</i>

15:48.907 --> 15:51.451
Good morning, son.
Big sales conference tonight.

15:53.203 --> 15:56.665
<i>Home is where
the happiness is, not the headaches.</i>

15:56.665 --> 15:59.918
<i>Where you're free and easy
to be your best.</i>

15:59.918 --> 16:01.879
<i>To live, love, and laugh,</i>

16:01.879 --> 16:06.466
<i>and leave the strains and stresses
of yesterday's world behind.</i>

16:10.721 --> 16:12.389
<i>So join Buck Manzell,</i>

16:12.389 --> 16:14.433
<i>star of television's</i> Space Sheriff<i>,</i>

16:14.433 --> 16:18.770
<i>and the rest of our exclusive club
of daring pioneers and happy families.</i>

16:18.770 --> 16:22.524
<i>And start living
your brighter tomorrow, today.</i>

16:23.400 --> 16:25.819
<i>Jacky, boy! You read me?</i>

16:25.819 --> 16:29.865
<i>Still caught up in that
goddamn terrestrial rat race?</i>

16:30.824 --> 16:32.159
Loud and clear, Buck!

16:32.659 --> 16:35.204
That's the fellow
from <i>Space Sheriff</i>, Leann. That's him!

16:35.204 --> 16:37.706
Imagine he came by for a cup of sugar.

16:37.706 --> 16:41.043
<i>Then let me tell these good folks.
True as Texas toast,</i>

16:41.043 --> 16:45.172
<i>ain't nothing but ice teas
and real-deal living up here.</i>

16:46.006 --> 16:48.383
<i>No neckties, tax men.</i>

16:48.383 --> 16:52.262
<i>No mosquitoes or traffic jams.</i>

16:52.262 --> 16:56.266
<i>So, who's the goddamn genius now, Jack?</i>

16:56.266 --> 16:59.561
Well, you said it, Buck.
Thanks for calling in.

16:59.561 --> 17:06.151
<i>And don't none of you forget,
ain't no law in the stars but me.</i>

17:09.905 --> 17:13.116
Well, you heard it
straight from Buck, so, I won't

17:13.116 --> 17:15.452
waste your good time telling you twice.

17:15.452 --> 17:21.333
But, when I think of the Brightside,
my wife out in our lunar garden

17:21.333 --> 17:25.753
and my boy shagging flies
on our zero-G diamond.

17:26.463 --> 17:27.464
My--

17:29.341 --> 17:31.343
My beautiful family...

17:42.187 --> 17:43.730
You know what? Explain this to me.

17:46.817 --> 17:48.861
We live with miracles at our fingertips.

17:48.861 --> 17:53.198
We fly to the stars, we split atoms.
We got robots taking out the trash.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.283
Why...

17:55.284 --> 18:00.747
are we all still waiting
to live our dreams?

18:01.331 --> 18:02.332
It--

18:02.958 --> 18:05.669
Well, there's a technical term
for that in my business.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.379
That's called a shit deal.

18:09.131 --> 18:11.216
Our best days
are piling up in the rearview,

18:11.216 --> 18:16.221
and that hope that keeps us going,

18:16.221 --> 18:18.182
it's wearing down to the bone.

18:21.310 --> 18:23.270
Some of us are losing people we love.

18:24.021 --> 18:25.230
And just like that,

18:26.398 --> 18:30.152
any day now, that turns into too late.

18:30.986 --> 18:32.279
Gone forever.

18:33.363 --> 18:36.074
Because every day
that we're not living for now...

18:38.493 --> 18:42.206
right now, we're waiting around dying.

18:43.457 --> 18:46.293
One empty promise at a time.

18:47.419 --> 18:49.421
I'm not waiting around anymore,
goddamn it.

18:51.757 --> 18:53.133
And neither should you.

18:54.593 --> 18:57.387
The time is now...

18:59.473 --> 19:02.100
and regret's a killer worse than death.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.421
There's still a lot
they haven't heard about yet.

19:32.256 --> 19:35.175
Can we agree
that hopelessness is not a top-seller?

19:36.176 --> 19:38.011
Thanks for coming out, folks.

20:09.835 --> 20:13.046
Congratulations, Joey,
on your new home in the stars.

20:13.714 --> 20:14.840
Thanks, Herb.

20:15.465 --> 20:16.675
You know, to be honest,

20:16.675 --> 20:19.219
this is actually coming
at a pretty great time.

20:20.137 --> 20:21.305
And that speech...

20:23.182 --> 20:25.392
you know,
I felt like he was talking right to me.

20:26.977 --> 20:28.812
Anyway, thanks again.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.859
You look like a man
who likes his personal space.

20:35.027 --> 20:36.361
Have a look at Kepler Crater.

20:36.945 --> 20:40.199
Big lots, very quiet, beautiful views.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.702
What about all them aliens?

20:44.620 --> 20:47.456
Well, not to put too fine a point on it,

20:47.456 --> 20:49.708
but, there's no such thing.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.210
Yeah, says you.

20:55.172 --> 20:57.257
You don't know me, but I know you.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.551
And we both know the same other person.

20:59.551 --> 21:03.222
And he said you've been losing
too many bets to stay healthy.

21:03.222 --> 21:05.015
Well, wait.

21:05.015 --> 21:07.851
What do you think I'm doing here?
Besides getting that person their money.

21:07.851 --> 21:10.187
Come on, here, okay? Here.

21:10.187 --> 21:13.941
Come back in the morning,
I will definitely have more, okay?

21:16.401 --> 21:17.402
Okay?

21:26.787 --> 21:30.207
<i>Nurse Grayton to
the holographic operating theater, please.</i>

21:40.926 --> 21:42.135
Mr. Billings?

21:46.807 --> 21:49.434
I bought a D-Plex today,
at the sales conference.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.645
All thanks to you. Joey Shorter.

21:53.438 --> 21:57.109
Hey, kid. Nice to meet you.
I think-- I must be on the wrong floor.

21:57.109 --> 22:00.904
Oh, yeah. I mean,
this floor has got the pretty tough cases.

22:03.031 --> 22:04.533
Is that your mom in there?

22:04.533 --> 22:05.742
Yeah.

22:08.453 --> 22:10.497
- Very sorry, kid.
- It's okay.

22:13.208 --> 22:17.379
- Well, wish I knew what to say.
- Well, what you said this morning

22:17.379 --> 22:20.007
really made all the difference
in the world, Mr. Billings. You know?

22:20.841 --> 22:23.302
I haven't let myself
look forward to anything,

22:23.302 --> 22:24.678
since all this happened.

22:24.678 --> 22:27.222
Well, that means the world
to hear you say that, kid.

22:31.143 --> 22:33.937
- Can I tell you something, Joey?
- Sure.

22:42.779 --> 22:47.367
I'm gonna upgrade you
to a nicer unit, on me.

22:47.910 --> 22:50.245
That way, if your dad or your girlfriend

22:50.245 --> 22:53.207
- wants to come up and visit...
- That's amazing.

22:54.917 --> 22:59.379
I mean, I don't really have
a girlfriend or a dad, but...

23:01.173 --> 23:03.675
Well, hey,
you're doing great without them.

23:03.675 --> 23:06.303
And your mom is a real lucky lady
to have you.

23:07.638 --> 23:08.639
Thanks, mister.

23:22.069 --> 23:26.907
"Congratulations.
A fantastic new world awaits you.

23:26.907 --> 23:29.785
Welcome
to the Brightside Lunar Residences..."

23:37.876 --> 23:39.419
Another round of the good stuff.

23:39.419 --> 23:42.506
Anybody tells you that the flush mechanism
on the men's urinal

23:42.506 --> 23:46.426
is an accident-free device
is a liar and a liability, okay?

23:46.426 --> 23:48.136
You mean the thing you just push down?

23:48.136 --> 23:50.973
That's very funny, Shirley.
I may never shake your hand again.

23:50.973 --> 23:52.933
Then it's good you didn't have
any sales to close today.

23:52.933 --> 23:54.101
Oh, Herb.

23:54.101 --> 23:57.980
You know, somehow your closing one
is sadder than my zero.

23:57.980 --> 23:59.857
Technically, it's better.

23:59.857 --> 24:02.526
Yeah, shut up, Herb--
See, this is the true tragedy

24:02.526 --> 24:05.112
of Jack fucking us
and leaving us to die in a ditch.

24:05.112 --> 24:07.072
It sets brother against brother.

24:07.072 --> 24:09.658
Don't blame Jack
you got beat up by a urinal,

24:09.658 --> 24:11.451
if you're really sticking with that story.

24:11.451 --> 24:14.538
Urinal all the way, Shirley.
And why stop at Jack?

24:14.538 --> 24:18.500
It's every boss who ever shat the bed
and made his loyal troops lie in it.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.962
Like Stan freaking Jenkins
up there on the goddamn moon.

24:21.962 --> 24:24.882
Thanks a lot, Stan. He doesn't even know
we exist down here,

24:24.882 --> 24:28.218
let alone sweat and bleed and need money,

24:28.218 --> 24:32.181
and get unjustly fucking crippled.

24:32.181 --> 24:35.601
If Jack is really gone,
do we still have a job?

24:35.601 --> 24:38.061
We have until someone says we don't.

24:38.061 --> 24:41.940
'Cause I'll probably need to inform Betty
if I'm unemployed.

24:41.940 --> 24:45.235
All right, nobody get more hysterical.
Jack's coming back.

24:45.235 --> 24:47.738
I will give you
five-to-fucking-one on that.

24:47.738 --> 24:49.948
There would have to be
a really good reason

24:49.948 --> 24:52.451
for Jack to just leave us
to die alone in a ditch.

24:53.202 --> 24:55.078
And while he did look pretty upset,

24:55.078 --> 24:57.539
he definitely would have told us
if he actually was,

24:57.539 --> 25:00.250
because our team is like our family,
except at work.

25:00.250 --> 25:02.669
So, probably everything is just fine.

25:05.339 --> 25:08.133
- Thanks a lot, Herb. I feel a lot better.
- Good.

25:15.140 --> 25:16.266
Yeah, come in.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.646
Here to make your stay more pleasant.

25:23.857 --> 25:24.775
Wait.

25:46.255 --> 25:47.840
Have a wonderful evening.

26:34.219 --> 26:38.140
Hello, guest.
May I help you with your transportation?

26:41.560 --> 26:42.561
Mr. Billings?

26:43.604 --> 26:45.898
- Mr. Billings!
- Hey, morning, kid. Sorry, I can't chat.

26:45.898 --> 26:47.482
Hey. Yeah, I hate to trouble you,

26:47.482 --> 26:49.693
but I think there's been a mix-up
with my application.

26:49.693 --> 26:51.987
See, I got this this morning
from the moon.

26:52.905 --> 26:54.907
I guess I must have gotten
rejected or something.

26:55.824 --> 26:57.159
Yeah. These--

26:57.159 --> 27:00.120
It's the damn finance guys,
they're not even half-human.

27:00.120 --> 27:03.248
Do you think I could talk to them?
They gave me back too much money.

27:03.248 --> 27:05.709
Don't waste your breath.
You're gonna find a great way to use it.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.503
Right, but I don't want it back.

27:08.545 --> 27:09.963
I got nothing for me down here.

27:09.963 --> 27:11.340
Okay, kid.

27:16.053 --> 27:19.097
Your problems will be waiting for you
up there too.

27:19.932 --> 27:21.058
You don't know that.

27:21.058 --> 27:22.893
I do. Better than anyone.

27:24.770 --> 27:29.024
I like to see my customers happy,
not playing themselves for a fool. Okay?

27:32.277 --> 27:34.446
So you canceled my sale then, huh?

27:36.490 --> 27:37.491
You know, you're--

27:38.116 --> 27:41.703
You talked a big game
about me grabbing hold of my life,

27:41.703 --> 27:44.206
but then you know my life
better than me, right?

27:46.625 --> 27:48.043
You're full of shit, mister.

27:59.805 --> 28:02.015
That was nice, kid. That's nicely done.

28:02.015 --> 28:03.517
Screw you.

28:04.893 --> 28:06.812
The one thing I had to look forward to...

28:06.812 --> 28:10.190
Well, you know, there are other things.

28:10.190 --> 28:14.403
You're a great kid, you're
not afraid to stick up for yourself.

28:14.403 --> 28:16.405
Not too bad at thinking
on your feet either.

28:16.405 --> 28:19.408
- That's the makings of something.
- Oh, yeah, wow, thanks.

28:19.408 --> 28:22.411
Well, I know what I just saw.
And I'd start you at 10%.

28:24.663 --> 28:27.249
It's not curing diseases or stopping wars,

28:27.249 --> 28:30.169
but sometimes,
giving folks a new dream to dream

28:30.169 --> 28:32.421
can make all the difference.
And you'd be good at it.

28:32.421 --> 28:34.256
I could teach you a few things
along the way.

28:35.424 --> 28:36.592
Are you lying to me again?

28:39.553 --> 28:40.637
Sorry about that, kid.

28:41.555 --> 28:43.307
Here's an honest deal.

28:43.807 --> 28:44.933
You come work for me,

28:45.434 --> 28:48.854
and pretty soon you'll have so much
going on for you down here,

28:48.854 --> 28:51.690
you'll forget all about
running away to the moon.

28:54.818 --> 28:56.361
I don't have any...

28:58.947 --> 29:00.115
nice clothes.

29:01.366 --> 29:03.452
Well, we better get you a suit then.

29:11.376 --> 29:12.836
All right, hop in.

29:20.719 --> 29:23.722
Here we go. We got lives to change.

29:42.991 --> 29:46.036
- Is that--
- Yeah. Joey.

29:47.871 --> 29:49.873
Gonna shape up into quite a young man.

29:50.457 --> 29:52.167
Wow, Jack.

29:52.751 --> 29:55.963
He's beautiful. The both of you.

29:56.463 --> 29:59.299
Well, thanks for kicking my ass about it.
He needed somebody.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.844
This is better than a dream.

30:03.762 --> 30:05.013
Love you, Ma.

30:10.269 --> 30:15.774
<i>Moon river, wider than a mile</i>

30:16.400 --> 30:18.360
- <i>I'm crossing you in style</i>
- The voice of the law!

30:18.360 --> 30:19.945
Hope I'm not in trouble.

30:23.699 --> 30:28.078
I'm loving life, Jack.
Living on the Brightside, thanks to you!

30:28.662 --> 30:29.746
Thank you, Buck.

30:29.746 --> 30:32.457
You know it means the world
to see our customers happy.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.418
Oh, Lord, Jack.

30:34.418 --> 30:37.504
Don't tell me you've been out there
without your suit and helmet.

30:37.504 --> 30:41.216
No need to worry. They got a bubble,
covers this whole place,

30:41.216 --> 30:42.718
keeps us safe and sound.

30:43.927 --> 30:46.263
Right.

30:47.514 --> 30:52.102
I forget sometimes,
but y'all thought of everything.

30:52.102 --> 30:55.147
Well, couldn't have done
any of it without you.

30:55.147 --> 30:57.774
I'm gonna head back down
to Earth now, okay?

30:57.774 --> 30:59.234
All right, don't you think of leaving

30:59.234 --> 31:02.321
without paying your respects
to Mr. Jenkins.

31:03.155 --> 31:04.156
I'd never.

31:12.414 --> 31:18.253
Well, I'll see you around, Sheriff.
The galaxy is in your hands.

Guys! Hey. We got Joey Shorter here.

32:04.216 --> 32:07.886
Eddie, Herb.
Joey Shorter, Shirley Stedman.

32:13.809 --> 32:15.894
