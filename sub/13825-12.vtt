01:26.002 --> 01:28.755
Look, Thomas. Zebras.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.507
Meerkats.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.675
And some zebu.

01:32.675 --> 01:34.761
Isn't Africa exciting?

01:37.847 --> 01:39.599
Oh! Lions.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.895
Your royal cousins.

01:43.895 --> 01:47.065
Just who you came to see.

01:49.484 --> 01:52.987
Go on, Thomas. Take their picture.

02:06.417 --> 02:10.088
Now what, pray tell, do we have here?

02:14.801 --> 02:19.180
So we're family, huh?
Well, let's hear you roar.

02:40.743 --> 02:44.497
Ahem. I hate to interrupt,
but is that for me?

02:48.167 --> 02:51.921
It's a sweet effort and all,
but this thing is a little scrawny.

02:51.921 --> 02:53.298
You may release.

02:55.258 --> 02:59.304
On the other hand,
you seem like a more substantial meal.

03:16.070 --> 03:18.031
Ahh-- Ahh--

03:39.010 --> 03:40.386
Big mistake.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.680
Now I'm gonna have to roar at you.

04:58.464 --> 05:00.299
Surprise!

05:02.468 --> 05:04.470
Happy birthday, cousin.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.889
You didn't think we'd forget, did you?

05:06.889 --> 05:09.475
In fact, we made you
all your favorite treats.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.979
There's plenty for you too, little buddy.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.482
So had your fill?

05:18.234 --> 05:22.447
Well, then, I guess it's time for us to eat.

05:29.746 --> 05:33.416
You know, it's really inconsiderate
to eat and run.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.844
Oh. What a cute baby.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.680
Coochie-coo, coochie-coochie-coo.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.519
Oochie-oochie-ooh. Ha-ha-ha!

06:07.116 --> 06:09.869
Somebody stole my baby's horn!

06:09.869 --> 06:11.537
Poachers.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.562
Hurry, Thomas!

06:45.154 --> 06:46.781
I know we wanted to see...

06:46.781 --> 06:49.659
...the wildlife of Africa
up close and personal...

06:49.659 --> 06:52.286
...but that was a little too close
for my taste.

06:52.286 --> 06:53.746
You said it, sister.

06:54.956 --> 06:56.582
What'd I say?

09:10.383 --> 09:12.260
Well, that's good enough for me.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.469
One more for the family.

09:22.478 --> 09:24.689
Excuse me.

09:55.386 --> 09:58.597
Today we're gonna practice
special jumps.

10:13.154 --> 10:16.198
I call this one the high hopperoo.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.676
Good on you, kids.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.219
You're doing very well.

10:39.513 --> 10:40.931
Stop!

10:40.931 --> 10:44.560
Watch where you're whirling about
when my little joeys are around.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.895
You might hurt someone.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.732
Now off with you.
Back to where you came from.

11:13.881 --> 11:16.425
All right, little ones. Nap time.

11:16.425 --> 11:20.513
I know you're tuckered out
from all that hopping.

11:58.300 --> 12:01.846
Dinner! Everybody bog in.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.360
That means you too, little roo.

12:16.360 --> 12:20.489
If you don't eat your roots and leaves,
you can't have any dessert.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.558
You say the nicest things.

12:47.558 --> 12:49.268
Ooh. Ha-ha-ha.

12:52.646 --> 12:55.232
I haven't seen you around here before.

13:03.115 --> 13:04.700
Mm...

13:05.659 --> 13:07.703
Hey, boomer!

13:08.370 --> 13:11.916
Cutting in on another bloke's sheila,
are you?

13:11.916 --> 13:16.378
You should be ashamed
of yourself, mate.

13:16.378 --> 13:18.547
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.050
Now stand up and fight like a roo.

13:42.571 --> 13:44.031
Holy dooley!

13:44.031 --> 13:48.452
You're the most pathetic baby platypus
I've ever seen.

13:48.452 --> 13:52.998
But I'm sure a mother's tender affection
would fix you right up.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.585
You know, I could take you back
to my burrow...

13:56.585 --> 13:59.046
...and raise you as my very own.

13:59.046 --> 14:00.422
Oh, crikey.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.550
I've never been a mother.

14:02.550 --> 14:06.470
Your grandparents will be so surprised.

14:06.470 --> 14:09.348
Hey, where are you going, little mister?

14:09.348 --> 14:12.101
It's time for a hearty brekkie.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.187
And I made you an ankle-biter classic.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.983
Just the thing to start a busy day.

14:18.983 --> 14:22.111
Earthworms and insect larva.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.094
Have you ever seen
a more beautiful garden?

14:47.094 --> 14:50.055
Everything here is so lush and exotic.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.182
The flowering cannonball tree...

14:52.182 --> 14:58.063
...the cool tropical ferns,
the beautiful hibiscus.

14:58.063 --> 14:59.565
Ahh-- Ahh--

15:02.443 --> 15:06.238
Oh! Must this mouse
follow us everywhere we go?

15:06.238 --> 15:10.075
Thomas, remove the dreadful nuisance.

16:02.086 --> 16:05.547
Oh, Thomas, look at this hydrangea.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.241
Help! Help!

16:32.241 --> 16:35.411
Crazy monkey. Crazy monkey! Aah!

16:36.161 --> 16:40.916
Oh, no.
All my important stuff is in that purse.

16:40.916 --> 16:42.835
Don't just stand there.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.087
Stop that beast.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.601
Hmm?

17:00.769 --> 17:02.187
Ah.

18:33.028 --> 18:34.947
Eh, Tony's Pizza. How can I help youse?

18:37.533 --> 18:41.286
Okay, 500 hand-tossed pepperoni pizzas.

18:45.207 --> 18:49.962
Five hundred hand-tossed pepperoni
and banana pizzas.

21:30.330 --> 21:33.750
That crazy monkey is driving my car.

21:33.750 --> 21:36.128
Oh, my, it's so clean.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.382
You brought me baskets of fruit
and a new silk dress?

21:40.382 --> 21:43.635
I had you all wrong.
You're a good monkey.

21:44.261 --> 21:46.471
And you're much too cute
to be a nuisance.

21:47.305 --> 21:50.058
In fact, I'm gonna give you
each 5 dollars.

21:50.058 --> 21:53.186
This has been the best vacation ever.

21:53.186 --> 21:57.816
<i>Scusi,</i> signore, but did you order
500 pepperoni and, uh, banana pizzas?

21:57.816 --> 22:04.156
Okay, with the delivery charge
that comes to $10,000.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.615
American.
