WEBVTT

00:00.481 --> 00:01.980
My name is Neil Truman.

00:02.033 --> 00:04.150
My wife, Grace,
and I were trying to live

00:04.202 --> 00:05.202
the American dream.

00:05.203 --> 00:06.870
I do stage open houses now.

00:06.905 --> 00:09.489
But it always felt like
something was missing.

00:09.541 --> 00:11.157
(Victor) I know why
you're in such a funk...

00:11.209 --> 00:12.742
mid-life crisis.

00:12.794 --> 00:14.627
So I jumped off a plane,

00:14.663 --> 00:17.497
quit my job,
before getting knocked on my ass

00:17.549 --> 00:20.050
when I found my wife trying
to deal with her own crisis.

00:20.085 --> 00:21.968
- Your wife pays me.
- What, for sex?

00:22.003 --> 00:25.305
(Neil) But that's when I
finally started living.

00:25.340 --> 00:27.140
I got his phone,
took his identity,

00:27.175 --> 00:28.808
met one of his clients,

00:28.844 --> 00:31.978
then got a surprising proposal
from someone who was much more.

00:32.012 --> 00:33.730
- Come work for me.
- [laughs]

00:33.765 --> 00:35.181
(Neil)
And I did.

00:35.183 --> 00:37.350
(Adriana) I have a service that
caters to very rich women.

00:37.402 --> 00:38.735
(Neil)
But I wasn't the only one.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.603
- Are you accepting new clients?
- Yes.

00:40.655 --> 00:42.522
I would love to talk
about redecorating my house.

00:42.574 --> 00:44.991
You're going to have to sign
a nondisclosure agreement.

00:45.026 --> 00:47.026
Not even your husband can know.
Is that a problem?

00:47.028 --> 00:49.362
(Neil) And that was just the
beginning for all of us.

00:49.414 --> 00:50.864
You would like us
to sign over

00:50.916 --> 00:53.166
your educational accounts
so you can go play...

00:53.201 --> 00:55.085
- at the what festival?
- The March Lawn Festival.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.087
(Neil) Grace and I may
still have our secrets,

00:57.122 --> 00:59.506
but despite it all,
our marriage and our dreams

00:59.541 --> 01:01.541
have remained intact
and, in some ways,

01:01.543 --> 01:02.759
gotten stronger.

01:02.794 --> 01:04.209
(Grace) I got the grant
to study design in Milan.

01:04.262 --> 01:05.545
(Neil) I would love
to come with you.

01:05.597 --> 01:06.930
But all that's
about to change...

01:06.965 --> 01:09.549
My husband found out.
I told him.

01:09.601 --> 01:10.884
It was starting to eat at me.

01:10.936 --> 01:12.685
Again.

01:19.310 --> 01:22.729
Is this what they mean
by "for better or for worse"?

01:22.781 --> 01:25.698
It's certainly an adventure.

01:25.734 --> 01:28.534
Yes, it is.

01:28.570 --> 01:31.154
We have a second chance now.

01:31.506 --> 01:35.825
Going to Italy
to pursue my dreams.

01:35.877 --> 01:39.245
We should have done it
years ago.

01:39.297 --> 01:42.081
Let's try not to get
pregnant this time.

01:42.133 --> 01:44.467
[both chuckle]

01:51.259 --> 01:52.559
Well, I'll try
not to drink too much.

01:52.594 --> 01:53.843
Sure you won't.

01:53.895 --> 01:55.178
Never thought
you'd be married.

01:55.230 --> 01:56.513
[gasps]
Oh!

01:56.565 --> 01:58.681
I guess that whole story
about you getting paid

01:58.733 --> 02:01.100
that was just so that I would
think it was a one-time thing.

02:03.271 --> 02:04.938
You know who I am, right?

02:04.990 --> 02:06.573
Neil...

02:06.608 --> 02:08.024
Your husband ruined
my marriage.

02:08.076 --> 02:09.776
Daniel, why don't
you and I go into the house--

02:09.828 --> 02:11.494
[gun cocks]
Don't! No, no, no, no!

02:11.530 --> 02:12.996
Wait, wait!
Here! Here!

02:13.031 --> 02:14.864
- Get back.
- Don't you move!

02:14.916 --> 02:16.115
Wait. Wait!

02:16.117 --> 02:17.116
How long were you two
having an affair?

02:17.118 --> 02:18.334
You got to put the gun down.

02:18.370 --> 02:20.620
I followed her that day
she went to your office.

02:20.672 --> 02:22.505
[groans]

02:22.541 --> 02:23.706
I know she saw you
more than once.

02:23.758 --> 02:26.509
How long?

02:26.545 --> 02:28.795
Listen to me.

02:28.797 --> 02:30.847
I know how you feel
right now.

02:30.882 --> 02:35.101
Oh, really?
You know how I feel, huh?

02:35.136 --> 02:37.804
How about--how about I screw
your wife?

02:37.856 --> 02:39.272
- Oh!
- And then you can tell me

02:39.307 --> 02:41.140
if you know how I feel.

02:41.142 --> 02:44.143
- Let her go.
- No, you're gonna watch.

02:44.196 --> 02:47.030
[crying, groans]

02:47.065 --> 02:50.149
- No!
- Listen!

02:50.151 --> 02:53.152
Listen, you think I ruined
your marriage,

02:53.154 --> 02:55.321
but I may have been a part
of saving it.

02:55.323 --> 02:57.156
I know from experience
that Mallory

02:57.209 --> 02:58.875
wouldn't have been looking
for someone like me

02:58.910 --> 03:00.743
if you'd been giving her
what she needed.

03:00.795 --> 03:03.413
- What did you say?
- I'm--I'm saying...

03:03.465 --> 03:07.083
that I made the same mistake.

03:07.135 --> 03:09.135
Didn't I, Grace?

03:09.170 --> 03:10.637
[breathing heavily]

03:10.672 --> 03:12.555
Yes.

03:12.591 --> 03:15.425
And what happened?

03:15.477 --> 03:17.760
I slept with someone.

03:20.181 --> 03:21.764
You're making this up.

03:21.816 --> 03:24.267
I wish I was.
I caught them together.

03:24.319 --> 03:26.352
[breathing heavily]

03:26.354 --> 03:28.354
Tell him
what it felt like, Neil.

03:30.525 --> 03:33.693
Tell me.

03:33.695 --> 03:37.830
My whole world exploded
in that moment.

03:37.866 --> 03:40.950
I hated you.

03:41.002 --> 03:42.502
And I wanted to kill
the son of a bitch she was with.

03:42.537 --> 03:44.754
I really did.

03:44.789 --> 03:48.124
But then I realized that that
wasn't gonna solve anything.

03:48.176 --> 03:49.792
Marriage is hard.

03:49.844 --> 03:52.629
People make mistakes,

03:52.681 --> 03:55.515
but if you really
love each other,

03:55.550 --> 03:58.217
then you work it out.

03:58.270 --> 04:01.971
You just need to want
the same thing, right?

04:05.644 --> 04:09.062
Your marriage was in trouble
before I came into the picture.

04:09.114 --> 04:11.781
Mallory came to me to fix it.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.233
So you want to blame anyone,

04:14.286 --> 04:16.119
blame yourself,

04:16.154 --> 04:18.071
you worthless piece of shit.

04:18.072 --> 04:20.123
- You son of a bitch.
- Aah!

04:20.158 --> 04:22.208
[gunshot]
[grunts]

04:22.243 --> 04:23.493
[screams]
Neil!

04:23.545 --> 04:25.545
[gasping]
Neil?

04:30.251 --> 04:32.335
[gasps]
Oh, my God.

04:32.387 --> 04:34.170
[Neil groans]

04:34.222 --> 04:37.006
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

04:37.058 --> 04:39.475
Yeah.

04:39.511 --> 04:41.311
My God, what happened?

04:41.346 --> 04:43.346
W-w-what just happened?

04:43.398 --> 04:46.399
[sobbing]

04:48.520 --> 04:50.320
Okay.

04:50.355 --> 04:51.654
- Oh.
- Grace.

04:51.690 --> 04:53.022
Grace, give me your phone.

04:53.074 --> 04:54.741
- [whimpers]
- Give me your phone.

04:54.776 --> 04:56.693
You're bleeding.

04:56.745 --> 04:59.245
Okay, go in the house.
I'll handle this.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.831
Just--
Yeah, go in the house.

05:01.866 --> 05:04.867

(Neil)
Grace?

05:38.486 --> 05:40.319
Grace, where are you?

05:40.372 --> 05:41.988
Do you know where
the Band-Aids are?

05:42.040 --> 05:43.406
I can't find
the Band-Aids.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.991
Grace, we need to talk.

05:45.043 --> 05:47.460
If this is about Simon--

05:47.495 --> 05:51.047
I don't give a shit
about him. Grace...

05:51.082 --> 05:52.915
What?

05:52.967 --> 05:56.386
Daniel's wife paid me
to have sex with her.

05:56.421 --> 05:59.555
She's not
the only one either.

05:59.591 --> 06:00.673
What?

06:00.725 --> 06:02.675
After I saw you
with Simon that day,

06:02.677 --> 06:04.310
I got a hold of his phone,

06:04.345 --> 06:06.512
access to his clients,

06:06.564 --> 06:09.065
and I experimented.

06:11.319 --> 06:13.236
[scoffs]

06:13.271 --> 06:15.855
You experimented?

06:15.857 --> 06:18.991
Experimented with what?

06:19.027 --> 06:21.327
Being a paid escort.

06:23.081 --> 06:24.781
[sighs]

06:24.833 --> 06:26.916
Are you joking?
Is--is this a joke?

06:26.951 --> 06:28.951
Look, if all of that
comes out right now,

06:29.003 --> 06:30.670
then other people
will be dragged into this,

06:30.705 --> 06:33.339
and we'll be at a huge risk.

06:33.374 --> 06:34.924
I had to take precautions.

Hello, Grace.

07:12.954 --> 07:15.755
- Adriana?
- You told her everything?

07:15.790 --> 07:19.626
I had to.
[door closes]

07:19.678 --> 07:22.128
(Neil) How do you two
know each other?

07:25.634 --> 07:28.134
That's why you had me sign
that confidentiality agreement.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.602
Hold on, Grace.

07:29.638 --> 07:32.188
You pimp out my husband,
then you hired me...

07:32.223 --> 07:33.389
Whoa, whoa.

07:33.441 --> 07:35.141
To decorate your house?

07:35.193 --> 07:38.194
What kind of monster are you?

07:38.229 --> 07:42.148
- You're the secret client?
- Neil, Grace...

07:42.150 --> 07:44.117
I just drove over here
to help you both out

07:44.152 --> 07:46.152
of what sounds like
a very delicate situation.

07:46.154 --> 07:48.871
Now, if you'd like me to stay,
we're going to have to put aside

07:48.907 --> 07:51.124
all of the other teenage
nonsense right now.

07:51.159 --> 07:52.992
Can we do that?

07:54.879 --> 07:56.212
[door closes]

07:56.247 --> 07:57.997
Police are on their way.

07:58.049 --> 07:59.298
Raymond,
these are the Trumans.

07:59.334 --> 08:01.467
- Trumans, this is Raymond.
- Anyone hurt?

08:01.503 --> 08:03.419
Need medical attention?

08:03.471 --> 08:04.754
Uh, no.

08:04.806 --> 08:06.723
Saw security cameras out front.
They work?

08:06.758 --> 08:08.141
Yes.

08:08.176 --> 08:09.642
Okay, first thing we need
to do is lay out the time line,

08:09.678 --> 08:10.678
get the story straight.

08:10.679 --> 08:11.728
Neil, show me
where it happened.

08:11.763 --> 08:13.763
Um...

08:16.017 --> 08:18.568
Neil, let's go.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.320
I'll be fine.

08:25.026 --> 08:27.944
So that was clearly
self-defense.

08:27.996 --> 08:30.279
Is your wife gonna
back you up on that story?

08:30.331 --> 08:32.198
Why wouldn't she?

08:32.250 --> 08:35.451
Adriana filled me in
on everything, Neil.

08:35.503 --> 08:37.453
If your wife decides
to spill secrets

08:37.505 --> 08:39.539
about your relationship
with my client,

08:39.591 --> 08:41.957
not only will I not help,

08:42.010 --> 08:44.210
I got to make sure
this doesn't go well...

08:44.212 --> 08:45.678
for either one of you.

08:45.714 --> 08:47.180
So what I'm gonna need
from you is to make sure

08:47.215 --> 08:48.881
that she goes along
with the program.

08:48.933 --> 08:53.603
Otherwise, this is gonna go
in a very different direction.

[indistinct chatter

08:55.056 --> 08:56.639

last time you saw Mallory?

08:56.691 --> 08:59.358
At my office a few weeks ago.

09:01.062 --> 09:03.396
No other contact?

09:07.285 --> 09:10.369
She means did you
have sex with her again.

09:12.073 --> 09:16.075
Right? Is--isn't that
what you meant?

09:16.127 --> 09:17.577
(woman) Last week she
filed a restraining order

09:17.629 --> 09:18.995
against her husband...

09:19.047 --> 09:20.797
after he got physical.

[cell phone vibrates]
Is she okay?

09:22.751 --> 09:25.251
Shaken up, but clearly
the guy was dangerous.

You're very lucky.

the security footage.

All right, well, I think that's
all we need for right now,

09:37.182 --> 09:39.515
unless there's anything
that you'd like--

09:41.319 --> 09:42.852
Thank you.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.509
I'm sorry.

10:06.544 --> 10:08.961
But you're gonna have to know
the whole truth at some point.

10:09.013 --> 10:11.180
There's more?

10:11.216 --> 10:13.800
You jeopardized
our whole family,

10:13.852 --> 10:16.803
and then you bring this bitch
back into our house?

10:16.855 --> 10:19.188
She has a lot more to lose
than we do if this goes public.

10:19.224 --> 10:20.606
If what goes public?

10:20.642 --> 10:22.308
T-t-the fact
that you're an escort?

10:22.310 --> 10:24.143
Look, I don't know about you,

10:24.145 --> 10:26.145

about myself

in our marriage.

35:28.026 --> 35:29.943
All right.

35:29.995 --> 35:31.611
What happened
to you, darling?

35:31.613 --> 35:35.165
Leaving a fortune in inheritance
to go into hiding? I must know.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.833
You have no idea who you're
dealing with right now.

35:36.868 --> 35:39.035
Do you?

35:39.087 --> 35:41.338
I will get them back.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.789
Well, like I said,

35:42.791 --> 35:45.125
if you're looking for work
in the meantime...

36:05.700 --> 36:07.951
Just came to pick up
a few things.

36:07.953 --> 36:10.537
Wasn't expecting you
to be back so soon.

36:10.589 --> 36:13.590
Did you get sick of all
the teenagers at the festival?

36:13.625 --> 36:15.208
You spoke to Anika.

36:15.260 --> 36:16.793
Yeah.

36:16.845 --> 36:19.346
She told me about the money.

36:19.381 --> 36:22.432
You probably think
that was a bad idea.

36:22.467 --> 36:25.468
No, I get it.

36:25.470 --> 36:28.271
You don't want her to make
the same mistakes that we did.

36:31.476 --> 36:34.027
Grace, you should have
seen her face.

36:37.032 --> 36:39.899
So Simon said
you're going to stay with him.

36:39.951 --> 36:41.151
Yeah, of course he did.

36:41.153 --> 36:43.403
No, I just went there because
I had some questions

36:43.455 --> 36:46.323
and I knew
he could answer them.

36:46.375 --> 36:49.326
It's not where I want to be
right now.

36:52.581 --> 36:55.215
You know, in all the years
that we've been married,

36:55.250 --> 36:58.385
you've never been
this mad at me.

36:58.420 --> 37:00.503
You seem
more forgiving today.

37:03.558 --> 37:05.558
Neil, I would like
to be mad at you

37:05.594 --> 37:09.396
and blame you for everything.

37:09.431 --> 37:12.015
I'm just as guilty.

37:13.685 --> 37:15.402
We've been more like roommates
for the past five years

37:15.437 --> 37:18.188
than a couple, and...

37:18.190 --> 37:20.740
you know, I'm just realizing
I'm mad at myself.

37:20.776 --> 37:22.158
Why?

37:22.194 --> 37:24.027
Because I didn't do
anything about it.

37:24.029 --> 37:28.248
I let it be okay for me,
and it wasn't.

37:30.952 --> 37:34.871
No, I suppose I did
exactly the same thing.

37:34.923 --> 37:37.841
I was terrified
that if we talked--

37:37.876 --> 37:39.876
I mean, really talked--

37:39.878 --> 37:43.380
that everything we were
would end.

37:44.716 --> 37:46.883
Yeah, and now look at us.

37:49.187 --> 37:53.890
I'm still hoping we
find our way back.

37:53.892 --> 37:56.726
That is all I ever wanted.

37:58.230 --> 38:01.231
Simon was just...

38:01.233 --> 38:04.067
a door for me
to try and--

38:04.119 --> 38:06.903
and, uh--and find this part
of myself that was lost

38:06.905 --> 38:10.623
so I could come back
into our marriage and...

38:10.659 --> 38:13.042
and fight for it.

38:15.414 --> 38:18.214
But now it's over, so...

38:40.405 --> 38:42.939
Let's just not make this
messier than it is.

38:48.914 --> 38:50.029

38:50.081 --> 38:53.283

38:56.838 --> 38:58.338
Lives here?

38:58.373 --> 39:00.790
Didn't you fly in to write me
a check for the app last month?

39:00.792 --> 39:01.841
Unbelievable.

39:01.877 --> 39:03.593
Victor, this is--

39:03.628 --> 39:05.712
Well, I don't think
I know your real name.

39:05.764 --> 39:06.764
It's Frank.

39:06.765 --> 39:08.097
Frank. Huh.

39:08.133 --> 39:10.467
- Victor, Frank. Frank, Victor.
- Oh. How are you?

39:10.519 --> 39:12.101
He's going to be running a group
meditation for the office

39:12.137 --> 39:13.636
- once a week.
- A what?

39:13.638 --> 39:15.722
We're going to be doing things a
little differently around here.

39:15.774 --> 39:17.357
Uh, can I get you
a drink, lunch?

39:17.392 --> 39:18.775
No, I'm good.

39:18.810 --> 39:20.193
All right, well, I need five
minutes to get settled in,

39:20.228 --> 39:23.029
- then I'll be right with you.
- Take your time.

39:28.069 --> 39:29.319
Group meditation?

39:29.371 --> 39:30.904
It's a stressed-out
environment.

39:30.956 --> 39:32.356
I think it'll be good
for everybody.

39:32.374 --> 39:33.656
Oh, no, sure.

39:33.708 --> 39:35.408
Why don't we just put bongs
in everyone's office

39:35.460 --> 39:37.420
and let them get blow jobs
on their coffee breaks?

39:37.462 --> 39:39.546
- That'll make everyone happy.
- Don't be a dick, Victor.

39:39.581 --> 39:41.080
Let me tell you
something, Neil.

39:41.132 --> 39:44.250
I didn't bust my ass to build
this firm from the ground up

39:44.302 --> 39:47.504
to have you turn it
into some hippie commune now.

39:47.556 --> 39:50.473
And I won't have you talk to me
that way again.

39:50.509 --> 39:54.561
You got lucky one time, son,
one time.

39:54.596 --> 39:56.980
You had a little midlife crisis
fever dream,

39:57.015 --> 39:59.816
and you got some nerd
to build you an app.

39:59.851 --> 40:02.902

around here is "what's next?"

40:02.938 --> 40:05.738

What's next?

40:08.910 --> 40:11.194
I know what
I don't want to do--

40:11.196 --> 40:13.276
sit in front of a computer
screen for 12 hours a day,

40:13.281 --> 40:15.782
analyze stock trends,
make the rich richer

40:15.834 --> 40:17.750
and pretend it doesn't matter
so I can go home,

40:17.786 --> 40:19.335
sit in front
of my TV and think,

40:19.371 --> 40:23.206
"One day I'll retire,
and everything will be great."

40:23.258 --> 40:25.091
That's not a life.

40:25.126 --> 40:26.209
That's a slow death.

40:26.211 --> 40:27.544
Yeah.

40:27.546 --> 40:30.380
But it's a very,
very profitable one.

40:30.432 --> 40:32.432

40:32.467 --> 40:36.469
Tell me what I'm missing
here, Neil, really.

I'm not
the same person anymore.

40:39.608 --> 40:41.057
Oh, here we go again.

40:41.109 --> 40:42.725
My old life is over,

40:42.777 --> 40:45.144
and my new one
won't be conventional.

And since
I can't go back in time...

I want to see what
the results are when I don't.

40:58.627 --> 41:02.245
