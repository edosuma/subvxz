And I'm not sure
how I feel about Nancy

23:06.994 --> 23:10.476
skipping another shift again,
but, hey, here we all are.

23:10.519 --> 23:13.870
Hope Jesse feels like
being a waitress again today.

23:15.829 --> 23:19.310
Do you want to talk about
what's really bothering you?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.879
Hey, Ace told me
that Aunt Mei said

23:22.923 --> 23:24.403
something about your lifeline

23:24.446 --> 23:26.056
being cut short
'cause of Odette.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.319
[sighs]
Not talking about that.

23:28.363 --> 23:30.800
Anyway, you're just using that
as an excuse

23:30.844 --> 23:32.585
not to finish
your dating profile.

23:32.628 --> 23:35.675
No, I'm deleting that. No way.

23:35.718 --> 23:38.025
No, I'm gonna be a
ghost-whispering spinster

23:38.068 --> 23:41.158
for the rest of my life, and
no profile can change that.

23:41.202 --> 23:43.857
[laughs softly]
Read the latest draft.

23:46.120 --> 23:47.774

23:49.515 --> 23:50.820
"Looking for someone
whose sense of wonder

23:50.864 --> 23:52.692
"will match my own.

23:52.735 --> 23:55.782
"Someone who is open
to new experiences,

23:55.825 --> 23:57.479
"who is unafraid of looking
at the world in a way

"that challenges prior beliefs.

24:00.177 --> 24:03.572
"Someone who is courageous
and loyal

24:03.616 --> 24:05.139

24:05.182 --> 24:06.532
Mm-hmm.

24:08.664 --> 24:10.187
Just thought that people
should know the truth.

24:10.231 --> 24:11.798
You wrote this?

24:11.841 --> 24:13.321
With a little help
from Odette.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.366
Most of the good stuff
was her idea.

24:15.410 --> 24:16.629
But not all of it, of course.

24:16.672 --> 24:19.458
Some of it was mine.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.721
We both just want you
to be happy, Bess.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.287
[laughs]

24:23.331 --> 24:25.028
Thank you.
[sniffles]

24:26.029 --> 24:27.683
And...

24:27.727 --> 24:32.383
Hey, I won't press you
to tell me what Aunt Mei said,

24:32.427 --> 24:35.430
but if you are ready to
talk about it, then...

24:35.474 --> 24:38.825
I will come to you, I promise.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.392
Good.

24:47.964 --> 24:49.705
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

24:49.749 --> 24:52.969
I-I'm in the middle of trying

24:53.013 --> 24:54.841
to track something down
for your husband.

24:54.884 --> 24:56.538
The Black Crown tape.

24:56.582 --> 24:58.018
Have you heard of it?

24:58.061 --> 24:59.367
No.I'm just trying
to figure out

24:59.410 --> 25:03.327
if it's something
that E-Everett needs

25:03.371 --> 25:05.547
or it's something
that he already knows about

25:05.591 --> 25:07.549
and is using to trap me
or other people.

25:07.593 --> 25:08.811
Everett.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.554
I think Everett
found out.

25:12.598 --> 25:14.904
He knows our little secret.

25:16.297 --> 25:18.081
Are you sure? What did he say?

25:18.125 --> 25:20.519
I know my husband,
and something isn't right.

25:20.562 --> 25:23.086
I should have done
more to protect you.

25:23.130 --> 25:25.915
To protect myself.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.570
You're not the only secret
that I've kept from Everett.

25:28.614 --> 25:31.399
Now what if this has
put you in more danger?

25:31.442 --> 25:34.228
I mean, what kind
of a grandmother am I?

25:34.271 --> 25:35.795
I-I think that if Everett
knew the truth,

25:35.838 --> 25:38.014
he'd bother putting me
through a loyalty test.

25:38.058 --> 25:40.321
Right now,
I'm playing my part.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.888
As-as long as I get

25:41.931 --> 25:44.455
Everett the information
he needs about Howard,

25:44.499 --> 25:46.327
then I should be good.

25:46.370 --> 25:48.721
I'll have proven myself.

25:48.764 --> 25:52.028
Well, that's not
our only problem.

25:53.813 --> 25:57.730
The florist will not confirm
the details of our delivery.

25:57.773 --> 26:01.560
You know, you tell someone
that their work is substandard

26:01.603 --> 26:03.866
once, okay, maybe twice,
and all of a sudden

26:03.910 --> 26:05.651
they act as if they're
too good for your business.

26:07.348 --> 26:08.915
Okay, well, I will talk to Lily.

26:08.958 --> 26:10.786
Yes. Do that.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.658
And do tell her

26:12.701 --> 26:16.966
that I disapprove
of her customer service.

26:17.010 --> 26:20.317
I will... definitely
not do that.

26:23.016 --> 26:24.800
What I want to know is
why did Everett

26:24.844 --> 26:27.411
keep paying Bobbsey
after he went to jail.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.326
Was it to keep him quiet
about the Black Crown tape?

26:29.370 --> 26:31.372
No. No, Bobbsey would be dead

26:31.415 --> 26:33.635
if Everett thought
he knew about the tape.

26:33.679 --> 26:37.073
The payments Everett makes,
they're for former employees

26:37.117 --> 26:39.685
that are in jail now,
you know, it keeps them happy.

26:39.728 --> 26:40.903
Happy people don't talk

26:40.947 --> 26:42.470
to the Feds about who they saw

26:42.513 --> 26:43.863
coming and going from the lodge

26:43.906 --> 26:46.082
or what they overheard
over the years.

26:46.126 --> 26:48.998
It's kind of like
an insurance policy, you know?

26:49.042 --> 26:50.304
Wait.

26:54.743 --> 26:56.963
This is a greenhouse.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.399
We didn't have a greenhouse.

26:58.442 --> 26:59.792
Really?
No.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.141
VAL:
Must be a clue.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.970
What did you have
that was green?

27:04.013 --> 27:07.974
Uh, tennis courts were green,
uh, swimming pool topiaries.

27:08.017 --> 27:09.192
The old stable

27:09.236 --> 27:10.454
was green.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.891
"Greenhouse."

27:11.934 --> 27:13.806
What was, uh, overgrown?

27:13.849 --> 27:15.242
I mean, pretty much everything.

27:15.285 --> 27:16.678
Bobbsey was a lousy
groundskeeper.

27:16.722 --> 27:18.419
Again, no offense.

27:18.462 --> 27:19.594
Okay, well-well,
what did he work on

27:19.638 --> 27:20.639
that was especially
half-assed?

27:20.682 --> 27:21.814
Well, the old stables.

27:21.857 --> 27:23.467
For sure.
And the aviaries.

to have.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.781
Was he trying to tell us...?

27:32.825 --> 27:34.696
"Everyone knows where
the bodies are buried."

27:34.740 --> 27:36.916
Yeah, leave it to my dad
to have a sick sense of humor

27:36.959 --> 27:39.309
about where he hides stuff.

27:39.353 --> 27:41.007
Okay, come on.

27:41.050 --> 27:43.879
It's time to go visit
to my favorite relatives.

[phone buzzing]

27:56.718 --> 27:58.285
Hello, Everett.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.374
What can I do for you?

28:00.417 --> 28:02.245
I wanted to check
on your progress.

28:02.289 --> 28:03.638
Unfortunately,

28:03.682 --> 28:07.729
Howard was found dead
in his hotel.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.731
Apparently it was a suicide.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.951
That's regrettable.

28:11.994 --> 28:15.737
Perhaps he was motivated
by his guilt about betraying me.

28:15.781 --> 28:18.131
Were you able to glean
any information

28:18.174 --> 28:20.220
about who he had been
in contact with?

28:20.263 --> 28:24.224
I was able to locate
his personal notebook, and, um,

28:24.267 --> 28:28.707
the-the most recent entry
before he killed himself

28:28.750 --> 28:30.447
indicates that he met
with someone who gave him

28:30.491 --> 28:31.710
a string of numbers.

28:34.103 --> 28:37.237
I can't figure out
what the numbers mean yet,

28:37.280 --> 28:40.109
but maybe a bank account?

28:44.635 --> 28:46.986
Focus on who gave him
the numbers.

28:47.029 --> 28:50.772
It's imperative that I learn
the identity of that person.

28:50.816 --> 28:55.124
Celia led me to believe you were
more effective than this.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.306
Okay. So...

29:03.350 --> 29:07.484
Everett didn't ask
what the numbers mean

29:07.528 --> 29:09.878
because he already knows.

29:09.922 --> 29:13.403
He wanted to know
who Howard's contact was.

29:13.447 --> 29:16.842
But he must have a way
of finding that out now.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.806

it's not too late to...

Yeah, it was a

What were you saying?

that it's not too late

29:55.271 --> 29:56.882

about this party.

29:56.925 --> 29:59.362
You're putting yourself in
